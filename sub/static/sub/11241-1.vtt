03:14.570 --> 03:19.073
Mom! Mom!

03:19.283 --> 03:22.827
Mom!

03:22.828 --> 03:25.872
Mom! Mom!

05:43.885 --> 05:45.928
Dude, it pays more, bet on that.

05:45.929 --> 05:49.807
Bro, listen.
The deal here is...

05:49.808 --> 05:55.313
You gotta keep your odds low, okay?
Then you'll play to win big.

05:55.314 --> 05:57.315
- Got it?
- You're telling me?

05:57.316 --> 05:59.734
Son, I was doing this
when you were still a baby.

05:59.735 --> 06:01.235
Good for you, brother!

06:01.236 --> 06:04.196
- Okay, okay. Write it. Mallorca.
- Mallorca.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.450
- Barcelona vs Atletico Madrid.
- Arda Turan!

06:07.451 --> 06:08.868
Who cares about Arda?
Barcelona it is.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.244
- Barcelona.
- Exactly. I agree.

06:10.454 --> 06:11.912
They won the championship last season.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.498
Dude, I like Catalans.
Catalans are good.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.710
- Messi will score. Barcelona it is.
- Barcelona, okay.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.463
- Write it down.
- Alright.

06:20.839 --> 06:24.091
- Zaragoza vs Girona.
- Girona? (Enter this)

06:24.092 --> 06:25.509
I like this name.
It's like "enter this bet".

06:25.719 --> 06:26.719
Okay, that's a likeable team.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.055
- The name says it: "Enter this!".
- What about the odds?

06:29.056 --> 06:33.225
- Okay, let's bet on this.
- Girona 1.9, Zaragoza 1.4.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.769
- Okay, dude.
- Girona! (Enter this).

06:34.770 --> 06:39.440
- Enter this bet! Yes.
- Okay, the last one. The last game.

07:57.269 --> 08:00.813
No way I'd bet for Albacete,
I wouldn't play anyway.

08:00.814 --> 08:04.024
Seyfi! Are you in, man?
You want to bet?

08:04.025 --> 08:06.986
- Dude! Hello?
- Seyfi!

08:06.987 --> 08:09.196
Seyfi, do you still
have that headache?

08:09.197 --> 08:11.699
Boss, enough with your fucking bets.

08:11.908 --> 08:12.950
My head's all fucked up
because of you.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.118
Oh, man!

08:14.327 --> 08:16.871
Bro, watch your words
or I'll fuck you like a chicken now.

08:17.038 --> 08:20.040
Yavuz, I bet you actually
fucked a chicken before.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.626
- What?
- Chicken, man, you know.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.880
Chief, please,
not in front of the newbie.

08:25.881 --> 08:29.008
Alright, alright. Just kidding man.
Don't get offended so easily.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.469
But I have plenty friends
who fucked chicken.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.305
You and your friends, man!

08:34.514 --> 08:36.932
Look, it's not about
fucking the chicken.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.809
No, it's about catching it.

08:38.810 --> 08:41.020
Chief, why don't you tell us
about your first time?

08:41.021 --> 08:44.398
- Was it with a goat or a cow?
- It was with an elephant!

08:44.399 --> 08:46.817
My first was an elephant! OK?
Cut the crap now.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.444
- Come on!
- Chief, come on.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.279
- Arda!
- Hey, go easy on your chief.

08:50.489 --> 08:51.238
Come on!

08:51.448 --> 08:53.032
Who fucks an animal
for their first time?

08:53.241 --> 08:55.284
Son... haven't you served in the army?

08:55.285 --> 08:59.121
70 percent of all Turkish men lose
their virginity by fucking an animal.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.290
- Whoa!
- Make it more like 20 percent chief!

09:10.800 --> 09:15.262
He's a city boy, this one.
I bet his daddy took him to a brothel.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.597
Did he?

09:16.598 --> 09:19.225
Nah, it was some senior students
in high school who took us to one.

09:19.226 --> 09:24.813
Dude, I'm seasoned with brothels,
whores, and whatnot, boy.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.150
Let me tell you a story.
He already knows this one.

09:28.151 --> 09:31.487
- What?
- The one with the string.

09:31.488 --> 09:32.613
Listen to this one.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.281
I was heading down
from Maslak highway.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.533
I saw this chick, right?

09:35.534 --> 09:39.286
And what a chick she was!
She was like amazing!

09:39.287 --> 09:40.996
She was... how should I put it?

09:40.997 --> 09:43.666
What was that called...
Victoria's... Sectr- or whatever.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.042
You mean the Victoria's Secret models?

09:45.252 --> 09:46.502
Yes! She was like one of them.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.004
So hard to find, yeah.
Anyways, I picked her up... driving.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.465
You picked her up?
Just like that?

09:51.466 --> 09:53.759
- What do you mean?
- You say Victoria's Secret.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.719
A Victoria's Secret model
in your car!

09:55.720 --> 09:58.013
- She was a whore, man.
- Oh... Ok. Go on.

09:58.014 --> 10:01.850
I picked her up, driving.
She had a mini skirt on.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.687
She was wearing a low-cut top,
earrings and everything.

10:04.688 --> 10:07.106
She was gorgeous.
Unbelievable.

10:07.107 --> 10:11.819
Anyways, we arrived at the hotel,
we went upstairs to the room.

10:11.820 --> 10:15.823
She started to get undressed.
She took off her skirt the earrings.

10:15.824 --> 10:19.034
She took off her high heels.
By the way, the room is dark.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.412
And I was excited as hell.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.706
I could hardly control myself.
She was so hot, man!

10:23.707 --> 10:29.295
Anyways, finally
I decided to make my move.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.047
Slid my hand between the legs,
and there it was:

10:32.048 --> 10:34.842
A huge cock.

10:34.843 --> 10:38.596
I was shocked,
and she laughed like you do now.

10:38.597 --> 10:41.932
It was a cock, man.
A frigging cock!

10:41.933 --> 10:44.727
- Fuck off! How the hell?
- What do you mean "how"?

10:44.728 --> 10:47.354
Look, there was a string.

10:47.355 --> 10:51.525
She pulled it up to her belly and tied
the string rope around her waist.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.319
- It was huge too.
- What did you do?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.070
What could I have possibly done?

10:55.071 --> 10:57.573
Since we were already there,
I went all the way.

10:57.574 --> 11:00.492
But next thing you know,
While I was doing my thing

11:00.493 --> 11:03.579
the son of a bitch started
jerking off while I do him!

11:03.580 --> 11:07.291
I was like "what the fuck?"

11:07.292 --> 11:09.877
It was dirty enough as it is.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.671
But she didn't stop.
I said "Cut that shit bro!"

11:12.672 --> 11:16.425
So I'm pretty seasoned with
all kinds of this shit, boy.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.803
Our religion teacher once said
it was awesome.

11:19.804 --> 11:24.892
We asked him about anal sex right?
He replies:

11:24.893 --> 11:29.313
"My son, why enter a shithole when
you have a rose garden next to it?"

11:36.237 --> 11:39.448
Maybe I'm an ass man!
What do you care?

11:40.158 --> 11:42.785
Our religion teacher also said
something very similar.

11:42.786 --> 11:45.079
Do you prefer ass, Seyfi?

11:45.080 --> 11:48.874
Yavuz, so, end of the day,
that woman gave it to your hand?

11:48.875 --> 11:50.709
Stop it!

11:50.710 --> 11:52.920
What if she'd said,
"Okay, my turn, bend over"?

11:52.921 --> 11:55.923
- I have hemorrhoids.
- Wow! You mean you'd do it otherwise.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.091
That's right, he would.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.259
What's up, kiddo?
Why are you laughing?

12:01.054 --> 12:04.348
Sir, because you were laughing...
That's why.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.517
So we entertained you with our jokes.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.394
No, sir, it's not like that.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.479
- It was a funny story.
- What's so funny about it?

12:10.480 --> 12:12.815
The woman turned out to be a man,
tying his junk.

12:12.816 --> 12:13.816
That's what I laughed at.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.734
So, you are saying
that I fucked a guy.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.445
- I didn't mean it that way, sir.
- No, you did.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.406
- Right? He said that I fucked a guy.
- Yeah, Yavuz.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.283
- He said that you fucked a guy.
- Okay, Yavuz, okay.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.911
- No way, sir.
- Are you calling me a faggot?

12:25.912 --> 12:27.830
- No, sir. No way.
- Wait. Come back here.

12:27.831 --> 12:29.957
- Yavuz, leave the kid alone.
- Wait a minute.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.750
- Akif, come here.
- Remzi, wait a minute.

12:31.751 --> 12:35.587
Step away.
Officer, the boy didn't mean it.

12:35.588 --> 12:39.883
He's not a boy anymore.
He can defend himself, okay?

12:39.884 --> 12:42.094
Sir, go easy on him.
He's just a kid.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.805
What is this?
Why are you touching me?

12:45.014 --> 12:46.557
Sir, he's just a kid.

12:46.558 --> 12:49.351
- Step aside.
- I apologize on his behalf.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.854
- Dude, you're getting on my nerves.
- Please, sir. Please.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.313
- Look!
- Take it easy, sir.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.732
Don't get on my nerves!

12:54.733 --> 12:57.651
- Don't piss me off!
- That's enough! Cut it out!

13:10.206 --> 13:13.834
- Okay, we're leaving. Come on.
- Come on, Arda.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.086
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

13:16.379 --> 13:19.047
- Watch it.
- Come on.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.091
If only you weren't cops.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.429
- What did you just say?
- He didn't say anything, sir.

13:25.430 --> 13:28.015
- The kid's talking to himself.
- You're getting on my nerves now.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.933
- Please, sir.
- You're totally getting on my nerves!

13:45.658 --> 13:48.786
- Sir, can you please just leave?
- You're pissing me off right now!

13:48.787 --> 13:51.079
- Enough already!
- Please, sir.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.998
Step away, man.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.419
I'm curious...
Let's see what you are going to do.

13:57.420 --> 14:01.882
Go on.
Do whatever you want.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.635
What happens here stays here.
Right, Apo?

14:04.636 --> 14:07.638
- Totally.
- Come on.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.306
Go on, hit him.

14:13.102 --> 14:16.188
Go on.
Show us your moves.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.066
Hit him already!

14:24.364 --> 14:26.740
Son, what did you say to me?

14:26.950 --> 14:30.244
The boss here is
telling me to hit you.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.746
Why don't you behave?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.751
Hit him, hit him!

14:43.341 --> 14:44.591
Look, look.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.927
Who do you think you're messing with?

15:38.646 --> 15:42.649
- Seyfi! What the hell is going on?
- Seyfi!

16:04.339 --> 16:06.548
Pass me the lighter.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.430
Give it back, you weasel.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.169
All he says is that he felt like
he was losing his mind for a second.

16:45.546 --> 16:48.465
He says it's not
claustrophobia or anything.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.717
He's feeling a bit better now.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.011
Boss helped him calm down.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.806
- Has this happened before?
- No.

16:56.641 --> 17:00.227
One time he felt dizzy in an elevator.

17:00.228 --> 17:03.689
It wasn't like this, though.
This is different.

17:05.024 --> 17:08.694
Claustrophobia could have
this kind of effect, sir.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.917
- Are you okay, man?
- He's okay. Let's go.

17:23.918 --> 17:26.086
I'm fine, sir.
I can drive. Come on.

17:26.087 --> 17:30.465
- Boss?
- I said I could drive.

17:30.466 --> 17:35.470
Seyfi, you should rest in the back.
Yavuz can drive. Come on.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.055
Boss.

17:37.265 --> 17:40.350
Why are you all
looking at me like that?

17:41.185 --> 17:43.020
I learned to drive when I was four.

17:43.021 --> 17:46.565
I was sitting at the wheel of a bus,
on my dad's lap.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.443
- Please. You're offending me.
- You're the man!

17:49.444 --> 17:51.403
Come on. Let's go.

17:52.989 --> 17:56.158
- Such a diva!
- Stop talking nonsense.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.201
- I feel really safe now!
- Come on, come on.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.085
- You're fine.
- God bless him. He's fine.

18:48.086 --> 18:49.878
I'm fine, okay.

19:38.010 --> 19:42.889
By the riverbank,
trees reaching into the air.

19:42.890 --> 19:48.145
Green leaves everywhere.

19:48.146 --> 19:52.941
If I can't have the one I want,

19:52.942 --> 19:58.321
Death should come and claim her heart.

19:58.322 --> 20:03.034
Come to me from the grapevine.

20:03.035 --> 20:08.498
In a blooming dress, you look divine.

20:08.499 --> 20:13.295
My love, let's go far away.

20:13.296 --> 20:18.175
Before the patrols arrive.

20:18.176 --> 20:23.263
Persian girl, Chechen girl,
You wear white and I wear pearl.

20:23.264 --> 20:29.019
Let's go high up the mountains,
You smell the roses, I smell the iris.

20:29.020 --> 20:31.563
The night is black,
and the cops are dark.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.899
When in trouble,
I am who you mark.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.526
My name's Apo,
call me and say "hello".

20:36.736 --> 20:38.528
Knock, knock! And I'm there.

20:38.696 --> 20:40.989
You are the man!

20:40.990 --> 20:46.036
We're not afraid, no way.

20:46.037 --> 20:53.293
My dear love, come sway.
We're not afraid, no way.

21:25.076 --> 21:26.534
There you go!

21:27.787 --> 21:32.791
All units. We have responded to a call
from the Inceagac neighborhood.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.793
We are waiting for backup.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.713
Nearby units, be advised:
4455 is at the scene.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.008
I repeat:
4455 is at the scene.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.135
What is it?
What is he saying?

21:44.136 --> 21:46.888
We're on our way to the scene.

21:46.889 --> 21:49.683
I'll let you know once we arrive.
Over.

21:49.684 --> 21:52.936
- What is it, Apo?
- 4455, bro.

21:52.937 --> 21:55.772
They're calling for
backup in Inceagac.

21:56.857 --> 22:01.486
Seyfi. Inceagac is near, right?
Somewhere up there?

22:01.487 --> 22:05.073
Yes, sir. It's really close.
I'll get us there.

22:05.533 --> 22:08.743
Okay, it's official now,
we won't be getting any sleep tonight.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.830
Beggars cannot be choosers.

22:17.295 --> 22:20.171
I remember this Inceagac, but...

22:20.172 --> 22:24.134
- Where did I hear about it?
- Look, sir.

22:24.135 --> 22:29.055
I heard many stories about that place
when I was a kid.

22:29.807 --> 22:31.266
Well...

22:32.685 --> 22:35.186
- God, it's late and everything.
- What stories?

22:35.187 --> 22:39.107
- I heard nasty stories.
- Wait, I know.

22:39.108 --> 22:42.027
There's a famous shrine there, right?

22:42.028 --> 22:46.531
Yes. There are many.
There are three just in that area.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.616
Dude, stop talking nonsense.

22:48.617 --> 22:51.119
How can there be nasty stories
in a place full of shrines?

22:51.120 --> 22:56.166
Boss, it's not like that.
But that place is no good.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.793
Weren't you in shock
just a minute ago?

22:59.003 --> 23:00.962
When did you wake up, pussy?

23:00.963 --> 23:04.799
Dude, you don't worry about me.

23:19.648 --> 23:22.192
God damn it.
We've been on this road forever.

23:22.193 --> 23:23.985
There was supposed to be a right turn,

23:24.195 --> 23:25.987
but there's still
no fucking sign of it.

23:26.614 --> 23:29.449
You piece of shit radio!

23:29.450 --> 23:32.577
Look, chief, there's no
communication at all, right?

23:32.578 --> 23:36.122
- This radio is broken. Get rid of it.
- No, son. Look.

23:36.123 --> 23:38.458
I receive signals.

23:43.172 --> 23:45.548
And this asshole is supposed
to know how to get there.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.175
Yavuz, cut the crap, man!

23:47.176 --> 23:49.511
Chief, I've been driving
on this road for 10 years

23:49.512 --> 23:51.554
but I have no memory of such a place.

23:51.555 --> 23:59.687
Fuck!

24:02.691 --> 24:06.194
- Seyfi, what happened?
- A man... A man passed by.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.863
- What man?
- He was completely naked.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.241
- So, where is he?
- I don't know!

24:11.242 --> 24:15.120
- There's no one here, dude.
- Where is he? Show yourself!

24:19.583 --> 24:21.751
Who's there?

24:23.254 --> 24:24.754
- Shit.
- Hey!

24:24.755 --> 24:27.924
- Shit.
- Hey! You assholes!

24:27.925 --> 24:31.803
- Who are you, you son of a bitch?
- Come out, you bastard!

24:31.804 --> 24:34.889
You bust our balls,
we'll rip your balls off!

24:34.890 --> 24:37.517
We'll fuck you,
motherfucking son of a bitch!

24:44.775 --> 24:48.695
- Sir, what's this?
- What's what?

24:48.696 --> 24:51.156
Were they here before?

24:51.157 --> 24:53.658
No, I'm seeing them
for the first time.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.452
What are these scratches?

24:55.453 --> 24:57.829
It's nothing.
Kids must have scribbled some shit.

24:57.830 --> 24:58.872
Who did this?

24:59.039 --> 25:01.666
You're asking
million-dollar questions.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.795
What the hell?

25:21.353 --> 25:25.982
So? Was it the frogs then?
All jump up together and hit the van?

25:35.951 --> 25:39.621
Boss.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

25:40.498 --> 25:42.373
Come on, bro.

25:57.264 --> 25:59.432
- I'll catch you!
- Okay.

25:59.433 --> 26:02.268
- I'll catch you, you sons of bitches!
- Yavuz, it's okay. Come here.

26:28.629 --> 26:31.548
Dude.
Are you sure you saw a man?

26:31.549 --> 26:35.843
- Shut your damn mouth.
- Man... Maybe it was animal?

26:36.053 --> 26:39.013
It was a fucking frog! Alright?
A frog!

26:50.150 --> 26:52.694
- What is this?
- I don't know.

26:52.695 --> 26:55.113
- Pass! Is it over?
- Yes. Come on.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.991
- Alright. How many did I get right?
- I don't know.

26:57.992 --> 27:00.118
- How much time do I have left?
- 1.5 minutes.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.077
Okay.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.956
Whackjob!

27:38.073 --> 27:40.908
My father used to say you shouldn't
talk about your dreams at night.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.201
Good one.

27:44.288 --> 27:47.582
When my mother was
six months pregnant with me,

27:47.791 --> 27:50.460
my name came to my father in a dream.

27:50.461 --> 27:54.464
They hand him a baby and
say "This is Arda".

27:56.133 --> 27:58.009
My parents are really into dreams.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.595
So they didn't even
think twice about it.

28:00.804 --> 28:04.307
- They named me Arda.
- God bless their souls.

28:20.741 --> 28:23.493
Boss, I'll tell you something,
but you can't tell anyone.

28:23.494 --> 28:24.952
Okay.

28:24.953 --> 28:27.246
- Promise?
- I promise.

28:30.584 --> 28:33.044
When I was a child
I had this close friend.

28:33.253 --> 28:34.337
His name was Coskun.

28:36.131 --> 28:38.675
He would come to our house
every once in a while.

28:38.676 --> 28:41.969
We'd go out, go to Kadikoy,
to the movies and stuff.

28:42.888 --> 28:45.807
One day, after seeing a movie,

28:45.808 --> 28:48.476
his dad had died recently.

28:49.645 --> 28:52.730
He told me about how
he was in the room when his dad died,

28:52.731 --> 28:55.191
and that he saw his soul rise
from his dead body.

28:55.192 --> 28:57.568
- He said he actually saw it.
- Saw what?

28:57.569 --> 29:00.905
The soul rising, leaving the body.

29:00.906 --> 29:05.118
- He was crying the whole time.
- The soul leaving the body?

29:05.119 --> 29:09.747
He said he saw the man's soul.

29:10.958 --> 29:15.795
His older brother was also there,
but he swore he didn't see anything.

29:16.630 --> 29:19.841
Anyways, we said to each other:

29:19.842 --> 29:24.512
Whoever dies first shall appear
to the other without scaring him.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.472
We made a promise.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.976
We were on a dark alley.
There was no one around.

29:29.977 --> 29:33.229
We scared ourselves.
And we hastily left the alley.

29:34.732 --> 29:37.817
I walked him to the ferry.

29:38.652 --> 29:42.238
I saw him go through the turnstiles.
I saw him get on the ferry.

29:43.615 --> 29:48.244
Then I went home.
Maybe 15 minutes later,

29:48.245 --> 29:50.455
my parents were not home,

29:51.498 --> 29:56.169
I went to my room and changed.
I got in bed.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.715
But I couldn't sleep.
I was still a bit restless.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.925
I pulled the duvet up and passed out.

30:03.093 --> 30:05.219
So what, kid?

30:06.805 --> 30:10.224
I had this dream.
There are lots of people around me.

30:10.225 --> 30:13.394
They are all glaring at me.

30:13.395 --> 30:15.271
You know how you fear
something in your dream

30:15.481 --> 30:17.064
but you don't quite know what it is?

30:17.065 --> 30:19.650
I feel such a fear inside.

30:21.069 --> 30:24.030
Then Coskun comes out from the crowd.

30:26.241 --> 30:29.535
He comes and holds my hand.

30:29.912 --> 30:33.039
He says: "Don't be afraid, Arda.
It's me. Coskun."

30:34.958 --> 30:40.254
Then, I wake up, soaked in sweat.
But I'm still dreaming.

30:41.507 --> 30:44.050
I hear moans
coming from my mom's room.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.429
I listen.

30:49.973 --> 30:56.020
Suddenly, it stops.
As if the people inside disappeared.

30:56.021 --> 31:02.235
I look at the living room.
The TV is on, but there's only static.

31:02.236 --> 31:04.862
I go turn it off.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.281
I look towards the hallway.

31:07.491 --> 31:11.160
There's someone in my room!
I can feel it.

31:14.039 --> 31:19.544
Coskun is in my room.
The thought of seeing him scares me.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.629
I run to my mom's room.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.673
I keep banging on the door,
screaming "Mom, Mom".

31:32.599 --> 31:35.017
Then, I woke up for real this time.

31:37.396 --> 31:40.064
That afternoon, we received a call.

31:41.024 --> 31:43.734
I could tell from my mom's
voice on the phone.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.071
It was so weird.

31:48.115 --> 31:50.283
Coskun had been
hit by a car that night.

31:50.534 --> 31:53.786
- Holy shit!
- I swear to God.

31:53.954 --> 31:56.706
Mom says I couldn't
function for ten days.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.916
But I don't remember anything.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.751
She says she left food
in front of my door.

32:01.587 --> 32:06.465
I've kept having that same dream.
I had it this morning as well.

32:08.010 --> 32:10.386
It's like I'm still dreaming.

32:13.307 --> 32:15.683
You're the first person
I've told about this, Boss.

32:19.897 --> 32:23.065
When was this,
how long before your parents' deaths?

32:25.736 --> 32:31.365
I lost them about a year later.
Car crash.

32:35.662 --> 32:38.331
Arda, I have something to tell you.

32:39.458 --> 32:43.169
I've been meaning to tell you this
ever since the day I met you.

32:43.170 --> 32:46.422
The day when your uncle
placed you in my care.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.883
What is it, Boss Remzi?

32:49.384 --> 32:54.889
You still don't realize it.
If only it could stay that way.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.391
What is it?
What are you talking about?

32:59.603 --> 33:02.396
Do you see anyone here,
other than us?

33:02.606 --> 33:04.190
The guys.

33:07.736 --> 33:14.450
Look around, but not like that.
Look around, taking it all in.

33:14.660 --> 33:19.080
- Is there anyone here, other than us?
- What am I supposed to feel?

33:24.711 --> 33:26.754
Boss Remzi, who is that?

33:27.130 --> 33:30.675
This is the first time
someone other than me is seeing it.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.349
Get away, you!

35:43.350 --> 35:45.184
- Arda, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

35:45.185 --> 35:46.560
- Breathe.
- I'm fine.

35:46.561 --> 35:47.978
Take deep breaths, son.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.189
- I'm okay. Where's my gun?
- Are you okay?

35:50.190 --> 35:53.150
How is everyone?
Any broken bones?

35:53.151 --> 35:57.571
- Fuck you and your driving!
- I'll fuck you up serious, Yavuz!

35:57.572 --> 36:00.908
And you're still talking!
Look at us, asshole!

36:00.909 --> 36:02.743
Fuck off!

36:12.879 --> 36:16.048
Were you the ones
who got in front of the van?

36:18.677 --> 36:21.053
Who did then?

36:21.054 --> 36:23.430
Come on, move it.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.307
Move it.

36:54.838 --> 36:56.589
Why the fuck is he laughing?

36:56.590 --> 36:59.717
Did you fall into the creek, sir?
Did you have an accident?

36:59.718 --> 37:02.636
Why the hell are you laughing?
Why the hell are you laughing!

37:03.513 --> 37:06.765
Don't do it, sir. Don't hit him.
He's a bit slow.

37:06.766 --> 37:08.559
Fuck this shit!

37:20.947 --> 37:25.242
God.
Who did we hit?

37:26.494 --> 37:30.206
Seyfi, Yavuz, come with me.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.752
We ran over that man.

38:14.084 --> 38:17.253
- Where is it, bro? What did we hit?
- We hit something, dude.

38:17.254 --> 38:19.713
- We ran over the guy.
- We hit him. There were noises.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.967
- Are you sure?
- What do you mean?

38:22.968 --> 38:25.719
- Then where is he?
- How the hell should I know?

38:25.720 --> 38:27.221
He sure as hell didn't fly away!

38:27.222 --> 38:30.432
I don't fucking know!
We hit that man, and he's gone now!

38:34.813 --> 38:39.984
- Seyfi, your face is bleeding.
- So is yours.

38:40.485 --> 38:43.821
- Where?
- Your face. It's bleeding.

38:53.290 --> 39:00.379
No radio. No phone.
We properly fucked up the van!

39:00.380 --> 39:02.131
Do you people have a phone?

39:05.844 --> 39:07.678
What is this damn place called?

39:11.182 --> 39:13.100
Inceagac.

39:15.312 --> 39:18.230
This is Inceagac.
It's the way to the woods.

39:18.398 --> 39:20.441
You should go through the grove.

39:20.650 --> 39:21.942
We've arrived then.

39:22.110 --> 39:23.652
You mean the place behind those trees?

39:23.862 --> 39:26.947
Yes, behind that grove.
200 meters at most.

39:26.948 --> 39:30.034
- Cut the fucking crap. Come on.
- What? Where, sir?

39:30.035 --> 39:31.869
We'll follow you.
You'll lead the way.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.495
You should sit
for a while and rest, sir.

39:33.663 --> 39:35.539
Sister, we've got work to do.
We're going now.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.082
I said it for your own good.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.918
If you have work to do,
you should go indeed.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.837
It's your bread and butter after all.

39:42.047 --> 39:44.256
Hey, what the hell
is the matter with you?

39:44.466 --> 39:45.758
Move it!

40:40.146 --> 40:44.441
Chief, isn't that our guys' car?

40:46.444 --> 40:48.195
- Back in the Ottoman days...
- Shut up!

40:48.196 --> 40:51.448
Okay, okay, Yavuz.
Let him speak. Speak!

40:51.449 --> 40:55.702
Back in the Ottoman days,
this place was a police station.

40:55.703 --> 41:01.667
When I was a child, it was a stable.
No one comes here now. Deserted.

41:01.668 --> 41:04.336
What are you doing here, Sir?

41:04.337 --> 41:10.426
Seyfi, did you know about this place?

41:10.427 --> 41:14.555
Chief, I heard about it
when I was a kid.

41:14.556 --> 41:16.723
It was a police station
back in the Ottoman days.

41:16.933 --> 41:19.935
Chief.
Come on, let's check on our guys.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.187
Okay.

41:22.397 --> 41:26.525
Everybody be careful, okay?
Come on.

41:34.325 --> 41:37.035
Your uncle placed you
under my care, Arda.

41:37.245 --> 41:40.038
Don't worry,
I have the key to all this.

41:58.475 --> 42:00.434
What the hell is this?

42:22.624 --> 42:24.958
All units! All units!

42:26.544 --> 42:27.836
It's not working.

42:34.511 --> 42:38.347
- Nothing works in this car!
- Seyfi, enough! Get a grip!

42:41.809 --> 42:46.605
Seyfi. Calm down, dude. Calm down.
We have the gun, we have the badge.

42:46.606 --> 42:48.190
- Okay?
- Okay, chief.

42:48.191 --> 42:52.152
- How does our national anthem begin?
- "Fear not".

42:52.153 --> 42:55.280
Just like that!
Come on, boy.

42:57.033 --> 42:59.993
Hey! Stop!
Don't run! Asshole!

42:59.994 --> 43:03.747
Fuck the police.
You goddamn sons of bitches.

43:18.346 --> 43:23.141
- Chief, I'm going in.
- Boss, come on. We're going in.

43:23.142 --> 43:25.644
Watch the back.
Come on.

43:26.104 --> 43:27.813
Easy.

43:38.533 --> 43:40.742
What the hell is this smell?

43:47.208 --> 43:49.585
There's nothing here.

44:35.340 --> 44:40.594
- Can anybody hear me?
- Is anybody there? Hello?

44:40.595 --> 44:44.681
- Is there anybody in there?
- We're talking to you, damn it!

46:34.041 --> 46:35.709
Shit!

46:40.965 --> 46:44.551
What the hell?
What's going on here?

46:46.262 --> 46:48.221
Look over here.

46:48.598 --> 46:50.474
Look at us, damn it!

46:53.686 --> 46:57.439
Who the hell are you?
Where is your unit?

46:59.233 --> 47:01.735
Stop your crying!

47:10.953 --> 47:13.580
Where is your unit, dude?

47:14.957 --> 47:17.292
Yavuz, check for his ID.

47:22.757 --> 47:24.341
There's nothing on him.

47:27.637 --> 47:30.347
What have you done to yourself?

47:31.474 --> 47:35.018
Were you the ones
who called for backup?

47:36.270 --> 47:39.189
- What the fuck is going on here?
- Son, where is your unit?

47:39.190 --> 47:41.066
Where is your unit?

47:56.207 --> 47:58.041
- Seyfi.
- Yes?

47:58.042 --> 48:00.335
Come here, take him to the car.

48:00.336 --> 48:03.797
- Now! Move it!
- Alright, sir.

48:08.970 --> 48:10.971
Come with me, man.

48:16.978 --> 48:19.020
Fuck.

48:46.215 --> 48:52.095
Bro, it's pitch black down there.
There's no way in hell I'm going down.

48:54.140 --> 48:59.686
Yavuz, you stay here with Arda.
Apo and I will go check.

48:59.687 --> 49:02.314
- Come on, Apo.
- Boss, I'm coming too.

49:08.487 --> 49:10.447
Are you sure, man?

49:27.131 --> 49:30.091
Fuck this shit!

49:37.433 --> 49:42.437
Brother, what's your name?
Did you call for backup?

50:26.607 --> 50:27.565
Fuck!

50:29.860 --> 50:31.361
Fuck! Fuck!

50:35.074 --> 50:36.032
Fuck!

51:53.277 --> 51:56.362
Fuck...
What the hell is this?

52:44.829 --> 52:46.663
Boss, let's get out of here.

52:48.624 --> 52:51.209
What the hell have you done here?

55:50.556 --> 55:53.391
Boss, run! Run!

56:15.205 --> 56:16.831
Arda, run!

56:24.131 --> 56:27.133
Remzi! Remzi!

56:30.346 --> 56:32.138
Remzi!

57:30.072 --> 57:32.407
Easy, boy.

57:39.081 --> 57:42.834
I felt like...
I was about to pass out.

57:42.835 --> 57:46.838
You're fine. Come on.
We'll leave after the coffee.

57:46.839 --> 57:52.009
- We have a long way to go.
- I feel so weird.

57:52.010 --> 57:57.598
Where am I? What am I doing?
I'm all dizzy. I don't understand.

57:58.183 --> 58:01.436
Not everything
has a clear answer, Arda.

58:02.688 --> 58:07.567
Let me put it this way:
Tonight, we're at a crossroads.

58:07.568 --> 58:12.321
Maybe it's just you and me,
maybe just you, maybe all of us.

58:12.322 --> 58:14.323
I don't know.

58:16.743 --> 58:20.746
We were summoned here tonight.
There was no call for backup.

58:21.206 --> 58:24.709
- We were summoned here tonight.
- What, who?

58:25.294 --> 58:27.962
I felt it the moment we stepped in.

58:28.130 --> 58:31.674
But I thought it was not possible.
I was wrong.

58:33.760 --> 58:36.554
So, you know what's
going on right now?

58:36.555 --> 58:41.100
When I was a kid, I used to see them
with my grandmother. We used to talk.

58:41.101 --> 58:43.811
Someone is looking for something.
So, it keeps wandering.

58:43.812 --> 58:47.648
It's haunting.
I can feel it.

58:48.484 --> 58:49.942
You can too.

58:50.152 --> 58:52.028
You can feel it on
the back of your neck.

58:52.237 --> 58:53.863
You just know that something's up.

58:55.991 --> 58:58.534
This has been happening to you
since you were a child, Arda.

58:58.535 --> 59:00.828
Don't you see?

1:02:56.732 --> 1:02:59.442
Who the hell are you,
you son of a bitch?

1:02:59.443 --> 1:03:02.319
How dare you chain the police?
Bastard!

1:03:46.573 --> 1:03:48.908
Who the hell are you,
you son of a bitch?

1:03:49.075 --> 1:03:51.202
Speak, damn it!

1:03:51.369 --> 1:03:53.245
Don't you have a tongue?

1:04:34.204 --> 1:04:40.918
I see you're here to join us tonight.

1:04:42.379 --> 1:04:47.007
And we're here to welcome you
the best way we can.

1:04:52.889 --> 1:05:02.773
On a night like this,
when doors open and realms unite,...

1:05:02.774 --> 1:05:06.735
...we're here in
this chamber together.

1:05:10.490 --> 1:05:17.454
Hell is not a place you go.

1:05:20.333 --> 1:05:26.797
You carry Hell with you at all times.

1:05:31.094 --> 1:05:34.972
You carry it inside you.

1:05:37.726 --> 1:05:45.983
We are your humble companions
on the road that fate chose for you.

1:05:48.236 --> 1:05:58.162
While the stones fall into place,
we can only be shepherds for you.

1:06:00.373 --> 1:06:02.833
And tonight,...

1:06:02.834 --> 1:06:10.174
...if fate put you first among the
creatures that we are going to herd...

1:06:11.259 --> 1:06:15.095
...there's nothing else we can do
but guide you.

1:07:09.567 --> 1:07:12.069
Don't do it! Don't do it!

1:07:13.279 --> 1:07:17.866
- Apo! Apo!
- What are you doing? Son of a bitch!

1:07:17.867 --> 1:07:19.660
Apo...

1:07:22.455 --> 1:07:26.000
- Son of a bitch!
- Apo, don't worry!

1:07:26.001 --> 1:07:28.210
It's going to be okay.

1:07:37.095 --> 1:07:39.555
Stop it!
You son of a bitch!

1:07:42.267 --> 1:07:43.517
Don't do it...

1:07:47.063 --> 1:07:48.564
Don't! No!

1:07:56.239 --> 1:07:58.699
Bro! Bro!

1:08:18.553 --> 1:08:22.389
What have you done?
What have you done!

1:08:23.683 --> 1:08:31.190
You die as you sleep,
you resurrect as you wake up.

1:08:33.443 --> 1:08:36.695
So, fear not.

1:09:44.973 --> 1:09:50.185
- Son, what is your name?
- We are the goddamn law!

1:09:58.695 --> 1:10:01.446
Do you think your law is here?

1:10:02.282 --> 1:10:10.372
- What is your name, son?
- Yavuz. Damn it, it's Yavuz!

1:10:10.957 --> 1:10:15.377
Yavuz, you look like
a tough young man.

1:10:15.587 --> 1:10:20.257
You're scared, but you look tough.

1:10:20.508 --> 1:10:25.512
The human soul is corrupt.
It only worships power.

1:10:25.930 --> 1:10:30.017
It keeps searching
for new things to worship.

1:10:30.018 --> 1:10:36.523
Because it has boundaries,
drawn by its masters.

1:10:36.524 --> 1:10:39.234
Who the hell are you?

1:10:43.823 --> 1:10:48.076
Are you insane? Are you insane?

1:10:58.171 --> 1:11:01.298
- Boss Remzi!
- Yavuz, close your eyes.

1:11:01.299 --> 1:11:04.384
- Close your eyes, Yavuz!
- Boss!

1:11:06.221 --> 1:11:10.098
Are you ready to stop worshipping
power and unite with us?

1:11:10.099 --> 1:11:13.352
Are you ready to be one
with the cosmos?

1:11:13.353 --> 1:11:17.105
Are you ready to
give up your worldly eyes

1:11:17.315 --> 1:11:20.442
and open your eyes
to what's beyond?

1:11:22.904 --> 1:11:25.280
Open your heart to me, son.

1:11:25.281 --> 1:11:28.533
- Open your mind to me.
- I can't. I can't.

1:11:30.578 --> 1:11:33.497
Please, don't.

1:11:51.015 --> 1:11:55.811
- Open your mind to me, son.
- Please, don't.

1:11:55.812 --> 1:11:59.731
Don't do it.
I'm begging you, please.

1:12:11.786 --> 1:12:13.120
Yavuz.

1:12:46.154 --> 1:12:49.865
Open the eyes of your heart, Yavuz.

1:13:16.142 --> 1:13:19.394
Don't let me down, Yavuz.

1:13:23.149 --> 1:13:24.816
Let's begin.

1:15:47.210 --> 1:15:48.793
Come on, Yavuz.

1:15:48.961 --> 1:15:52.547
Show us that
you are the right passenger.

1:16:01.682 --> 1:16:04.976
I'm begging you, don't do it.
Don't do it.

1:16:15.613 --> 1:16:19.616
Open your heart to us, Yavuz.
Don't stop, and it will open.

1:16:19.617 --> 1:16:21.368
Open your mind.

1:16:24.163 --> 1:16:31.378
Don't stop, and it will open, Yavuz.
Open your heart to us, son.

1:16:32.797 --> 1:16:38.552
Come on, dear. Come on, Yavuz.
Come on, Yavuz. Come on.

1:16:40.471 --> 1:16:41.930
Come on!

1:17:18.217 --> 1:17:24.389
Yavuz, you're not opening your heart.
You're not.

1:17:24.390 --> 1:17:28.435
It should be wide open.
Otherwise, it's no good.

1:17:30.313 --> 1:17:33.982
Open your mind.

1:17:33.983 --> 1:17:35.609
No... No...

1:19:13.082 --> 1:19:15.959
Maybe the honor will be yours, Arda.

1:19:20.005 --> 1:19:22.757
Come to me! Come here!

1:19:25.136 --> 1:19:26.845
He's just a kid!

1:20:26.197 --> 1:20:28.907
I wasn't wrong, Arda.

1:20:39.460 --> 1:20:40.919
Come...

1:20:51.430 --> 1:20:59.646
Remzi, I thought it was just you.
But you're two passengers here.

1:20:59.647 --> 1:21:02.440
A thousand thanks to you, son.

1:21:02.650 --> 1:21:06.611
You took care of this boy,
you helped him.

1:21:06.612 --> 1:21:10.365
And now,
he's ready to understand himself.

1:21:10.574 --> 1:21:12.659
I can see it in his eyes.

1:21:13.035 --> 1:21:15.370
You saw it too, right?

1:21:16.705 --> 1:21:22.794
Boss! Boss!

1:23:52.277 --> 1:23:55.071
Remzi! Remzi!

1:23:55.781 --> 1:23:58.616
Remzi! It's okay.
Everything's okay.

1:23:58.617 --> 1:24:01.452
Backup's on its way. Just look at me.
Look into my eyes.

1:24:01.453 --> 1:24:03.830
Hang in there...

1:24:07.292 --> 1:24:09.502
"Whoever dies first,

1:24:09.712 --> 1:24:14.841
shall appear to the other
without scaring him."

1:24:15.884 --> 1:24:20.596
- Remember, Arda?
- Don't do this! Don't go!

1:24:23.726 --> 1:24:26.185
I made a promise to your uncle.

1:24:26.186 --> 1:24:28.563
If you get harmed,

1:24:28.772 --> 1:24:34.610
he'll hold me responsible
in the afterlife.

1:24:43.620 --> 1:24:48.666
- He's here, man. He's here.
- You don't need to be afraid.

1:24:48.834 --> 1:24:57.008
I have only one key in this life.
And it's yours now.

1:25:29.666 --> 1:25:31.375
Arda...

1:25:33.295 --> 1:25:35.797
Everything ends, but...

1:25:37.132 --> 1:25:39.300
everything starts anew.

1:25:42.012 --> 1:25:43.471
Everything ends, but...
