00:32.000 --> 00:36.938
This is Eagle 107, Eagle 107.
Approaching, Delta target.

00:54.662 --> 00:58.537
Eagle 107 to base.
Eagle 107 to base.

00:58.569 --> 01:02.717
We found, found it.
Hey guys, the lost canyon is real.

01:06.749 --> 01:09.804
Tad, dinner's ready.

01:10.038 --> 01:14.186
In a minute. The Explorer's
just landed at the excavation site.

01:14.515 --> 01:17.538
107 equipment to the base.
Digging started.

01:20.589 --> 01:24.831
Yo Tad, you found some treasure?
Not yet.

01:25.097 --> 01:28.737
Dude, you find anything.
Looser.

01:29.995 --> 01:33.760
- Tad, dinner's getting cold.
- Coming.

01:34.214 --> 01:38.760
One, two and three.

01:48.439 --> 01:52.259
Gold? Gold.

01:53.392 --> 01:57.282
Gold. I found my
first treasure.

02:01.450 --> 02:04.059
We Want You for the
archaeology elite.

02:05.467 --> 02:11.388
It's one of your father's cufflinks. He
always said they were his lucky pair.

02:12.166 --> 02:16.143
Finally. I'm not a loser.
You sure aren't.

02:20.420 --> 02:22.177
Good night, Tad.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.447
Wait. You got to check
for monsters, first.

02:33.759 --> 02:35.837
I almost forgot.

02:38.407 --> 02:40.072
Clear

02:41.063 --> 02:42.962
Clear

02:44.407 --> 02:47.133
All clear.

02:47.828 --> 02:52.188
Dad wasn't afraid of anything, was he?
- Sure he was

02:52.375 --> 02:54.593
But he had courage
to face his fears.

02:54.606 --> 02:56.835
What exactly was he afraid of?

02:57.664 --> 03:01.062
...that his little boy never got to sleep on time.

03:05.108 --> 03:07.600
Sweet dreams, my little boy.

03:07.843 --> 03:11.569
You'll be the best treasure hunter
,when you grow up.

03:20.764 --> 03:23.755
Oh this is not good. Grandmother?

03:51.327 --> 03:56.647
You know what bandaged face? Some day
I will grow up, and then you won't scare me.

06:29.874 --> 06:31.765
Stop.

06:39.685 --> 06:42.654
Download that moron before he
gets hurt

06:43.544 --> 06:46.817
Or worse. I get sued.

06:54.462 --> 06:59.024
Hey, boy. you're back. Super cookie!

07:01.844 --> 07:06.165
Tad, this is your final warning.
Stop goofing-off!

07:06.258 --> 07:09.086
But there could be important stuff
down there.

07:09.336 --> 07:14.515
For the last time. You're a construction worker. Not an archaeologist.

07:15.076 --> 07:18.271
And stop bringing this
mangey mut to work.

07:18.303 --> 07:22.189
He's not a mangey mut. Jeff was
named after Thomas Jefferson...

07:22.215 --> 07:25.645
who is considered the forefather
of American archaeology.

07:25.718 --> 07:28.156
Interesting factoid, right?
Don't you think?

07:35.704 --> 07:39.415
Here's another interesting factoid.
You're fired!

07:44.166 --> 07:46.259
Tad, man. You can't keep
doing this.

07:46.285 --> 07:49.503
This is the seventh time you've
been fired this year.

07:49.619 --> 07:52.118
Well, I can't be
fired forever.

07:52.642 --> 07:57.329
How you gonna cover your rent and pay for gas?
And buy dog â€‹â€‹food?

07:57.455 --> 08:01.908
Do not worry about me, guys.
I've really got something here, I can feel it.

08:02.975 --> 08:04.693
See ya'.

08:20.073 --> 08:22.721
Metropolitan Museum.

08:26.315 --> 08:29.440
- Hey Tad.
- How're you doing', Melinda?

08:29.566 --> 08:31.316
Hey, it's Max Mordon.

08:32.332 --> 08:35.784
- I'm his number one fan.
- Really?

08:35.964 --> 08:39.924
Is Professor Humbert here?
I need him to authenticate anything.

08:40.097 --> 08:45.879
Yes, he's in his office. And take
him this while you're at it. It's urgent.

08:47.946 --> 08:52.329
Urgent, humm? Jeff,
you have to wait here.

09:06.345 --> 09:10.032
Come on Tad, they're dead.
They are not zombies.

09:15.058 --> 09:20.363
Thaddeus, what brings you in today?
Did you make another one of your discoveries?

09:20.660 --> 09:24.433
The discovery! I found at
the new metro station site, today.

09:24.582 --> 09:27.910
I'm sure this is my first
step to being the next Max Mordon.

09:27.957 --> 09:32.449
Don't even mention that creodont. He turns
archaeology into a media circus.

09:33.665 --> 09:35.415
Let me see.

09:35.619 --> 09:40.033
Second hand dealings not my field
but let me have a look see.

09:40.104 --> 09:45.337
I read they're worth a fortune. I'll gonna' buy
the best archaeological equipment...

09:45.482 --> 09:49.536
- Unfortunately, it's just a replica.
- What?

09:50.438 --> 09:52.063
Are you sure?

09:52.719 --> 09:55.836
A limited edition of 1999.

09:58.791 --> 10:01.517
Do not feel bad. As
Thomas Jefferson said...

10:01.571 --> 10:05.206
in a thousand years will be a
valuable archaeological find.

10:08.540 --> 10:12.548
Thaddeus, my boy. I'm sure
you'll find something valuable one day.

10:12.806 --> 10:17.251
Don't ever stop dreaming. Keep moving on
like a rolling stone.

10:17.501 --> 10:22.047
Is that from Thomas Jefferson, too? No it's
from Bob Dylan, but it's perfect, huh?

10:22.619 --> 10:26.979
Thank you Professor. But after finding
a fake Coke bottle

10:27.116 --> 10:32.006
a piece of moon rock made of wood,
an Etruscan a vase, made in China...

10:32.100 --> 10:34.443
My dreams are shattered.

10:36.053 --> 10:41.076
- Oh, I almost forgot. It's urgent.
- Lavrof.

10:45.322 --> 10:49.314
Paititi. This crazy old man has
found Paititi!

10:49.400 --> 10:50.932
He found what?

10:50.958 --> 10:52.745
I can't believe it,
he found it.

10:52.900 --> 10:56.290
I've been waiting for this moment
for more than 30 years, Thaddeus

10:56.384 --> 10:58.134
Man you're patient.

11:09.519 --> 11:11.308
A key.

11:11.478 --> 11:15.431
More like half key. Now it
seems that 30 years later...

11:15.454 --> 11:17.909
Professor Lavrof has found
the other half.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.737
That's why he wants me to go to Peru.

11:20.838 --> 11:23.306
Wouldn't it be cheaper
to just with FedEx it?

11:23.369 --> 11:27.166
Thaddeus, this is the key to the
golden city of Paititi.

11:27.228 --> 11:30.696
The biggest archaeological discovery
since King Tut's tomb.

11:30.744 --> 11:32.931
Really? Awesome!

11:33.600 --> 11:35.514
- Rats!
- What?

11:35.561 --> 11:40.678
The plane ticket is for today, 7 PM
That's about two hours.

11:40.713 --> 11:43.295
- What am I going to do?
- Don't worry about a thing.

11:43.334 --> 11:45.951
Tad Stone, on the case.

11:51.202 --> 11:53.834
So, tell me more about Paititi.

11:53.897 --> 11:56.787
See Thaddeus, according to legend...

11:57.303 --> 12:00.193
500 years ago, when
the Incas discovered

12:00.206 --> 12:03.107
that the Spaniards wanted
take all their gold...

12:03.162 --> 12:05.951
they asked Mother
Nature for help.

12:06.006 --> 12:11.420
Mother Nature told them to take all the
their gold to a secret place, Paititi.

12:11.889 --> 12:15.318
Once there, they hid
treasure, and in exchange...

12:15.344 --> 12:19.140
Mother nature gave them a
magic golden statue.

12:19.209 --> 12:23.912
Gold Indian of Paititi. A
statue with magic powers.

12:23.998 --> 12:27.708
Whoever guards it will be blessed
with the gift of immortality.

12:27.818 --> 12:31.278
So that they do believe
that they live in the Lost City

12:31.302 --> 12:35.172
thanks to the magic power
of the Golden Indian.

12:35.811 --> 12:40.592
So they are still alive?
It's just a legend, Thaddeus.

12:40.647 --> 12:44.365
But these tablets prove,
that the city exists.

12:50.498 --> 12:53.592
Run. They're gonna'
close the gates.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.892
Here, take this... as a memento.

12:58.971 --> 13:02.330
Belonged to Indiana Jones.
Indiana Jones?

13:02.373 --> 13:04.958
Never heard of him, but
Thanks that's cool.

13:05.264 --> 13:07.178
Good luck with your trip.

13:08.850 --> 13:10.561
Do you like it, Jeff?

13:11.553 --> 13:13.459
Drop it.

13:13.577 --> 13:15.897
Professor wait.

13:23.946 --> 13:27.805
Final boarding call for Doctor
Jeremiah Humbert. Doctor Jeremiah Humbert...

13:27.907 --> 13:29.657
Professor, your bag

13:30.413 --> 13:32.788
CAUTION! Slippery, wet floor

13:33.016 --> 13:34.587
Professor.

13:42.998 --> 13:44.944
We need a medic.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.458
Are you OK?

13:48.607 --> 13:53.638
- Yes, I'm fine I just need my pills.
- Pills? Yes, right away.

14:06.776 --> 14:11.237
Thanks, Thaddeus. I do not know what
I'd do without my blue pills.

14:11.753 --> 14:14.331
Your blue pills?

14:16.997 --> 14:20.927
- Pills for blood.
- Sleeping pills.

14:20.966 --> 14:26.231
I'm feeling better already. Nothing can
stop me from getting on that plane.

14:26.271 --> 14:27.856
Professor.

14:28.052 --> 14:32.887
I've identified the target. He has the
tablet, I'm sending his photo.

14:32.982 --> 14:37.872
Perfect, I'll report it to the boss.
Proceed with the plan.

14:39.904 --> 14:42.630
Sir, we've got access to the mass chamber.

14:49.772 --> 14:54.241
- Hello, are you an angel?
- He'll be fine. Relax.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.701
We'll take him to the hospital
and pump his stomach.

14:56.757 --> 14:58.278
Ok, I'll go with him.

14:58.357 --> 15:01.256
He just needs to rest for a few days
don't worry.

15:01.636 --> 15:05.706
Take your flight Professor.
I take good care of him.

15:33.109 --> 15:36.273
There are still hidden
archaeological finds...

15:36.375 --> 15:39.736
<i>in the most isolated places on the planet...</i>

15:39.834 --> 15:41.740
<i>Jewels waiting to be discovered
that will shed light on mankind's past.</i>

15:41.764 --> 15:44.991
<i>Most of them see the light through
the man of exceptional qualities...</i>

15:45.038 --> 15:49.115
<i>Sir Maximilian Mordon, possibly
greatest explorer of our time.</i>

15:49.249 --> 15:51.351
Max Mordon on the case.

15:52.374 --> 15:54.905
Max Mordon on the case.

15:55.327 --> 15:59.600
Professor Humbert can say what he
wants, but Max is Mordon the bomb..

15:59.913 --> 16:03.342
<i>This program is sponsored by Super
rich, super flavour, super health.</i>

16:03.368 --> 16:05.584
<i>The best for your
, dog super cookies.</i>

16:05.804 --> 16:09.936
- No, Jeff, stop it.
- Would you care for more coffee, professor?

16:11.639 --> 16:13.257
Thanks.

16:32.304 --> 16:34.382
Professor Lavrof?

16:34.460 --> 16:38.015
Professor, Lavrof. Great to see you.
Nice to meet you, professor Humbert.

16:38.420 --> 16:43.436
- I'm not Professor Humbert.
- Perfect, I'm not Professor Lavrof, either.

16:43.499 --> 16:46.554
He sent me to pick you...
I mean Humbert... up.

16:46.851 --> 16:48.456
Well, Professor Humbert sent me
in his place.

16:48.469 --> 16:50.085
I'm Tad Stone.

16:50.140 --> 16:55.163
I mean, Professor Stone. I'll
take good care of you, Professor Stone.

16:55.505 --> 17:00.263
- By the way, is there anything you need?
- No thanks. I'm OK.

17:00.341 --> 17:02.880
Come on, my friend.
Now, with Freddy.

17:02.942 --> 17:06.200
If you make a purchase in the next two
minutes, included at no extra cost...

17:06.226 --> 17:09.388
a digital bathroom scale, or a
special cream

17:09.415 --> 17:12.369
whale meat completely
free of charge

17:13.101 --> 17:16.593
Not interested in any
these products? No problem.

17:17.851 --> 17:20.499
Come on, boss. I got a
family to feed.

17:21.765 --> 17:24.406
Okay okay. I'll take this.

17:25.593 --> 17:27.413
Now. Take it.

17:28.171 --> 17:31.155
Smart choice, boss. The best
Frisbee thrower made in China.

17:31.264 --> 17:33.725
Lifetime Warranty. Thousands
different uses.

17:33.804 --> 17:37.327
Thousands? For what? This is
part of the magic of the product.

17:37.367 --> 17:39.226
You have to find out,
for yourself.

17:39.827 --> 17:42.070
Look, here comes the
boss lady.

17:59.435 --> 18:01.443
Hey wait! Let me go!

18:02.068 --> 18:06.286
- Where is the professor?
- Over there. Those guys took him and...

18:07.966 --> 18:10.567
Oh my God, they're kidnapping
Professor Humbert.

18:10.580 --> 18:13.192
Not Humbert. He is...

18:14.755 --> 18:16.723
Nice mutt.

18:17.763 --> 18:20.110
The stone tablet.
This is his back pack.

18:20.123 --> 18:22.481
Listen, boss lady I...

18:23.599 --> 18:25.841
C'mon, Freddy, to the car.
This is...

18:25.896 --> 18:27.845
No buts’ Freddy. We
we can't let them go.

18:27.858 --> 18:29.817
Come on, Freddy run!

18:29.966 --> 18:33.396
You're robbing the wrong man.
I'm broke. I just got fired.

18:33.466 --> 18:35.154
Shut up.

18:44.589 --> 18:47.831
- Give me the tablet.
- What tablet?

18:47.949 --> 18:50.245
We know you have it, Professor.

18:50.949 --> 18:54.027
Ok, A-I'm not a professor,
I am a bricklayer.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.245
And B, I don't have it.

19:01.318 --> 19:03.310
And C, I know where it is.

19:03.755 --> 19:07.122
Step on it! Faster! You want us
to get killed, boss lady?

19:07.294 --> 19:09.450
No way. Ok,
How much do you want?

19:09.497 --> 19:12.739
Two hundred Euros. And I get myself out of here, with my ex-wife and my savings.

19:12.794 --> 19:15.075
I'm not Professor Humbert.
I swear.

19:20.943 --> 19:22.443
Professor HUMBERT.

19:22.483 --> 19:25.545
There's a perfectly logical explanation
for this.

19:28.841 --> 19:31.435
There is also a logical explanation
for that too.

19:42.609 --> 19:44.843
Wait. Before you turn my face into
a Frappuccino...

19:44.856 --> 19:47.101
Check-out my passport.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.097
Cavalry, Freddy.
At your service.

20:42.849 --> 20:45.794
Hey, Jeff. You're OK.

20:46.084 --> 20:51.185
- OK, you're not Professor Humbert.
- That boss lady is what I've been trying to tell you.

20:51.311 --> 20:54.725
My name is Stones.
Tad Stones. Professor Stones.

20:54.928 --> 20:57.912
- Humbert sent me in his place.
- Really?

20:58.069 --> 21:01.029
That's weird. He never
mentioned any Stones.

21:01.085 --> 21:04.928
Last minute thing.
And you, who are you?

21:04.999 --> 21:08.100
I'm Sarah Lavrof. Professor Lavrof's
Daughter.

21:08.179 --> 21:11.059
How long have you been working with
Professor Humbert?

21:11.116 --> 21:15.936
- Not so long. I'm new.
- Oh great, a rookie.

21:16.218 --> 21:19.163
Yes, well. But I've been digging
since I was five.

21:22.067 --> 21:24.575
You don't look like a
professor of anything.

21:24.763 --> 21:30.434
- That's because I am a man of action.
- Oh really? Check-out G.I. Joe.

21:33.230 --> 21:35.156
Is that kind of
welcome normal here?

21:35.169 --> 21:37.106
What do these guys want?

21:37.356 --> 21:39.726
Well, obviously
Humbert's tablet. They

21:39.727 --> 21:42.254
must know you have it.
You're in grave danger.

21:42.645 --> 21:45.965
Ah, it's OK. They
don't scare me.

21:51.246 --> 21:53.285
Jeff stop!

21:54.762 --> 21:56.332
Oh my god.

21:56.527 --> 21:59.466
Ah don't worry, my room's pretty much
like this sometimes.

21:59.575 --> 22:02.387
Do not be a fool. Those
guys broke in.

22:06.118 --> 22:07.641
Jeff, come here.

22:09.259 --> 22:11.501
Belzoni.

22:12.150 --> 22:15.501
- Give me that.
- Belzoni, what are you doing here?

22:18.171 --> 22:21.765
Here trade. Super Cookie.

22:23.905 --> 22:25.530
What's this?

22:28.187 --> 22:32.265
Dear daughter. Take care of this.
I'm going to Machu Picchu.

22:32.320 --> 22:35.171
Do not let it
fall into the wrong hands.

22:39.583 --> 22:44.395
- Tad, bring your bachpack here.
- Yes, I'm coming!

22:47.155 --> 22:51.905
- Hey, isn't that...
- The other half of the tablet.

23:04.928 --> 23:10.404
What's it say? I don't know. It's
in ancient Chimu.

23:10.708 --> 23:12.434
My father and Humbert are
the only

23:12.447 --> 23:14.184
remaining Chimu experts in the world.

23:14.635 --> 23:17.760
Belzoni, why are we going
to Machu Picchu? Why?

23:17.846 --> 23:20.330
Come on bird. Speak up!

23:20.920 --> 23:22.599
What do you want?

23:22.654 --> 23:24.580
He's mute. And don't call
him bird.

23:24.593 --> 23:26.529
He get's offended.

23:26.967 --> 23:30.646
Just our luck. A mute
parrot with an attitude problem.

23:31.045 --> 23:32.787
Buzz off!

23:32.845 --> 23:35.501
Belzoni, focus.

23:37.204 --> 23:39.079
He's put on weight?

23:40.227 --> 23:42.063
He had a heart attack?

23:42.204 --> 23:45.305
He choked on a chicken bone
, peanuts, a hairball.

23:49.157 --> 23:51.298
Someone's chasing him.

23:52.813 --> 23:55.282
Who's chasing him, Belzoni
Belzoni, who?

24:00.235 --> 24:03.399
Hey, that's the guy
in the SUV, who kidnapped me.

24:07.934 --> 24:09.875
- We need to do something.
- So, what are you going to do?

24:09.888 --> 24:11.840
Call the police?

24:11.886 --> 24:13.416
And tell them what?

24:13.439 --> 24:16.480
...that my father sent a mute
parrot with a message?

24:16.535 --> 24:19.628
- No. I'm going to Machu Picchu.
- That sounds dangerous.

24:19.746 --> 24:21.968
- Are you sure you should go alone?
- Are you offering

24:21.981 --> 24:24.214
to come along,
Professor Stone?

24:24.797 --> 24:28.484
Well, offering... I wouldn't go
so far as to...

24:32.218 --> 24:34.147
I'm in.

24:42.664 --> 24:45.430
- Let me help you with that.
- Thanks.

24:45.534 --> 24:49.744
No problem, I'm totally yours.
Totally.

24:49.933 --> 24:52.558
Hey, what are you doing here?

24:52.963 --> 24:55.681
I promised her father I'd
look out for his daughter.

24:55.744 --> 24:57.769
And I get paid time and a half
when I travel.

24:57.795 --> 25:00.628
As you know amigo, I have a
family to feed.

25:03.357 --> 25:05.701
What time is it? Oh no.

25:09.178 --> 25:12.584
Good. I missed today's episode of
My favourite series...

25:12.831 --> 25:15.886
- the lonely passion of Amber.
- You'll live.

25:15.964 --> 25:17.577
Yes, but will Amber
live after

25:17.590 --> 25:19.214
her experimental brain transplant...

25:19.249 --> 25:22.291
to help her forget Peter
who broke her heart?

25:38.897 --> 25:40.472
What are you looking at?

25:41.022 --> 25:43.492
I'm trying to figure out
what these signs mean.

25:43.694 --> 25:46.366
Professor Lavrof has been
looking for this, all his life.

25:46.803 --> 25:51.990
- Why do you call your dad, "professor"?
- As an archaeologist, he's the best. Totally.

25:52.014 --> 25:57.365
Driven, 24/7. Which kind of gets in the
way of the father thing.

26:04.649 --> 26:08.117
- They have the tablet, sir.
- Excellent.

26:15.395 --> 26:18.168
It' ll be great to find the last...

26:19.786 --> 26:25.356
- Miss Lavrof what an unexpected pleasure.
- Have we met before?

26:26.295 --> 26:28.756
It's him! It's him!

26:29.327 --> 26:32.381
- I need that tablet.
- Never.

26:34.296 --> 26:36.397
Got it!

26:38.749 --> 26:40.249
Thank you.

26:42.647 --> 26:45.568
No, you won't escape.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.725
No.

26:49.059 --> 26:51.153
Way to go, Belzoni!

26:52.107 --> 26:53.927
Stop that bird.

26:55.236 --> 26:58.431
Cheap kitchenware.
The best in Peru.

26:58.604 --> 27:01.666
I'm trying to make an
honest buck here.

27:05.744 --> 27:09.611
Give it to me. Look out!

27:10.158 --> 27:13.267
- It's on the roof.
- Got it. Follow me!

27:16.258 --> 27:17.867
My bad.

27:17.977 --> 27:21.313
- Tad, my God.
- I'm fine. Get the tablet.

27:26.636 --> 27:28.870
Get your filthy paws off me.

27:43.713 --> 27:46.947
- Where do you think you're going?
- Upstairs?

27:47.020 --> 27:48.941
I'll give you a lift.

27:50.424 --> 27:51.544
Tad!

27:52.129 --> 27:53.934
We got it, sir.

27:54.300 --> 27:57.831
<i>The vehicles are ready.
Mission accomplished. Let's bug out..</i>

28:03.412 --> 28:04.912
Instant replay.

28:09.934 --> 28:11.528
Odessus.

28:17.109 --> 28:21.210
- Tad, I know who these guys are. These
goons are from Odessus.
- What's that?

28:21.343 --> 28:24.069
Pirates. They mustn't
get the tablet.

28:24.234 --> 28:26.718
Belzoni, here.

28:51.710 --> 28:54.054
- Ha!
- What you are you laughing at?

29:13.323 --> 29:15.409
Tad, look-out!

29:18.801 --> 29:20.333
Run!

29:30.898 --> 29:35.515
- We're alive.
- Yes. What's that smell?

29:35.773 --> 29:38.023
It's not me, I swear.

29:45.043 --> 29:49.675
<i>They are in the last carriage. Get them,
I need that tablet.</i>

29:50.784 --> 29:55.002
- Who are these Odessus guys?
- They will seek treasures all over the world.

29:55.101 --> 29:58.960
Those guys lie, steal and even murder
to get their hands on them.

29:59.016 --> 30:00.828
And then sell everything to
the highest bidder.

30:00.866 --> 30:02.777
They don't care about
history and culture.

30:02.790 --> 30:04.711
They just want money and power.

30:05.241 --> 30:07.069
Greedy pirates.

30:07.178 --> 30:12.108
If they find Paititi, and the legend of
statue is true, they'll become immortal.

30:12.241 --> 30:15.451
We'll stop them. We'll find
Paititi before they do.

30:15.514 --> 30:18.007
Hey guys, we got company.

30:34.910 --> 30:36.449
I think we lost them.

30:37.238 --> 30:40.743
- They are not the only one's lost.
- Don't worry boss lady.

30:40.847 --> 30:44.379
This state of the art GPS with advanced Llama vision will take us wherever you want.

30:44.777 --> 30:46.886
...for a little extra.
- Come on, Freddy.

30:46.956 --> 30:48.870
I have a family to feed.

30:54.298 --> 30:56.345
Well, she's family, too.

30:56.665 --> 30:59.821
Ok, Machu Picchu.
Come on my friends.

32:06.213 --> 32:08.260
Machu Picchu?

32:09.471 --> 32:12.596
- Wow awesome.
- Ok, let's get to work

32:14.085 --> 32:18.780
On a second thought. I'll go to the village and grab some munchies while you guys get to work.

32:19.072 --> 32:22.025
Ok, we'll meet you later.
Let's go Tad.

32:31.054 --> 32:33.062
Oh No. We're late.

32:33.335 --> 32:37.084
The Pirates of Odessus have been here first.
They must have taken my father.

32:37.155 --> 32:41.272
- Don't worry Sarah, we'll find him.
- Thanks, Tad.

32:41.430 --> 32:45.477
Let's look around. Maybe we can
find some clue where they've taken him.

32:50.211 --> 32:53.094
Wait. This is Max Mordon.

32:53.266 --> 32:57.750
- You got to meet Max Mordon?
- Well, actually I'm his number one fan.

32:58.028 --> 33:02.302
- No, you're not. Because I am.
- Okay, sure, if you say so.

33:02.516 --> 33:05.219
- Can you help here please?
- Yeah, sorry. But..

33:05.266 --> 33:08.141
Look, I have a picture,
personally signed.

33:08.211 --> 33:12.117
Me and Jeff stood in line for like 25
hours, just to get it.

33:12.375 --> 33:15.719
Is this is a #1 fan stuff, or what?

33:16.767 --> 33:19.993
- Who is Toad?
- He misunderstood my name.

33:20.056 --> 33:24.642
- Anyway, how did you meet him?
- He was one of the Professor's students.

33:26.502 --> 33:28.658
Is this guy your dad?

33:30.275 --> 33:33.330
So this must be your
mother, she's pretty.

33:34.393 --> 33:36.190
She was pretty.

33:36.518 --> 33:39.940
She passed away. Now my
dad is all I have left.

33:40.261 --> 33:42.768
I'm very sorry.

33:45.183 --> 33:47.722
Hey, wait. The photo!

33:48.041 --> 33:50.220
It was taken at
Nasca desert.

33:50.260 --> 33:52.362
My father always said
these ruins showed the way to

33:52.375 --> 33:54.487
Paititi; like
a map or something.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.605
- But he never had the key for it.
- But we do.

33:56.618 --> 33:58.701
The tablet is the key.

33:59.259 --> 34:01.925
That's why Odessus
want it so badly.

34:02.091 --> 34:05.239
So, the next stop...
The Nasca desert

34:08.569 --> 34:11.897
And now. If you buy a treasure pack 3000
in the next two minutes...

34:11.943 --> 34:15.326
you get a second one; shipping
and handling absolutely free...

34:15.389 --> 34:17.982
terms and conditions apply
because of the 3000 packs...

34:19.444 --> 34:23.545
It's market day, boss lady.
Look, I got a burger for you.

34:26.574 --> 34:28.308
What's wrong, Belzoni?

34:29.199 --> 34:30.730
On the left, look.

34:32.558 --> 34:35.728
- It's them, Odessus.
- How did they find us?

34:35.753 --> 34:37.277
Go!

34:47.324 --> 34:50.722
Spread out, I want them alive.

35:57.349 --> 35:59.997
Hey, come back. My balloon.

36:05.121 --> 36:07.511
Get the white hawks.

36:18.503 --> 36:20.401
Hit it, bird.

36:22.370 --> 36:23.995
DO YOU EVEN.

36:25.409 --> 36:29.080
- Do we really need to watch
this, Freddy?
- Of course, boss.

36:29.253 --> 36:33.971
Today, Amber will find out the secret real
identity of her stepmother, Ginger.

36:34.401 --> 36:36.235
Listen, they're about to say it.

36:36.261 --> 36:39.691
<i>Amber, you always believed
I was your mother...</i>

36:40.042 --> 36:44.635
<i>but the truth is... I
I am your father.</i>

36:44.987 --> 36:47.386
What? Dear sensita.

36:47.471 --> 36:50.542
This is best chapter ever!

36:54.731 --> 36:57.231
The burgers are ready.

36:58.114 --> 37:01.700
The Nasca desert must be
just over that mountain.

37:02.601 --> 37:06.976
I am really looking forward to meeting
your father. I bet you're very proud of him.

37:07.304 --> 37:09.851
It is not easy to be the daughter
of a scholar.

37:09.976 --> 37:12.137
They always pay more
attention to their discoveries...

37:12.143 --> 37:14.030
than to the people who love them..

37:14.140 --> 37:17.702
When I was a kid, my father
was hardly ever at home.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.498
I barely knew my parents.

37:20.499 --> 37:23.924
When I was five, they
had a car accident.

37:24.174 --> 37:25.807
My grandma raised me.

37:36.481 --> 37:40.418
It was my dad's. It's
my good luck charm.

37:40.622 --> 37:42.262
Sometimes...

37:42.523 --> 37:47.335
I feel that he's not really gone.
Like he's still watching over me.

38:01.221 --> 38:04.900
Oh! Check it out Jeff.
The Nasca desert.

38:07.268 --> 38:09.065
Jeff are you all right?

38:12.004 --> 38:14.512
Hey, guys, I think Jeff is sick.

38:22.162 --> 38:24.193
What the...

38:27.170 --> 38:30.584
- Come on, boy. What's wrong?
- Maybe he's hungry.

38:40.001 --> 38:43.290
This has to be serious. He doesn't
react to super cookies.

38:43.407 --> 38:46.117
Boss, we have a problem here.

38:51.234 --> 38:55.687
- What's this, Jeff?
- A tracking device.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.293
In their groin.

39:47.852 --> 39:50.477
- Professor.
- Sara.

39:52.975 --> 39:56.912
- I finally found you.
- You shouldn't be here.

39:57.337 --> 40:00.501
- I've come to save you.
- Save me?

40:00.657 --> 40:03.782
I think you're just as much of a
prisoner as I am.

40:04.441 --> 40:06.012
Is that's all you have to say?

40:06.059 --> 40:08.777
I come all this way from
Cuzco to get you.

40:08.981 --> 40:11.926
- Me too.
- Who are you?

40:15.969 --> 40:20.110
- Max, what are you doing here, are you all rightl?
- Yeah, don't worry.

40:20.227 --> 40:24.297
These grave robbers have kidnapped me because I am the world's greatest expert in mummies and...

40:24.321 --> 40:28.195
- and sarcophagi of ancient Egypt.
- Max Mordon, is it really you?

40:28.293 --> 40:30.973
They had to kidnap this clown.
Of all people.

40:32.977 --> 40:36.571
Sweetie, I've never been more
happy to see you.

40:36.618 --> 40:40.258
- Me you.
- Me too. I'm your number one...

40:42.151 --> 40:44.291
number two, fan.

40:44.378 --> 40:48.370
And National Petro graphic
subscriber since I was five.

40:48.456 --> 40:50.300
I didn't catch your name.

40:50.597 --> 40:53.121
Toad, Tad Stone.

40:53.163 --> 40:56.827
Professor Stone. Dr. Humbert
sent him in his place.

40:57.144 --> 40:59.566
Professor? Really?

40:59.644 --> 41:03.019
Hey, amigo. Nice machine gun,
but it looks old.

41:03.082 --> 41:06.699
Don't worry my friend. Let me
introduce you to the brand new...

41:06.855 --> 41:11.948
Hyper performance 250. 50 bullets and
two triggers for just...

41:12.762 --> 41:14.894
What are you doing?

41:20.710 --> 41:25.054
Dame, just give them what they want
and I'm sure they'll let us go.

41:26.906 --> 41:30.403
Miss Lavrof may I have the
tablet, please?

41:30.404 --> 41:32.882
You didn't bring it here,
did you?

41:34.502 --> 41:37.315
Oh great, I can't believe it.

41:51.297 --> 41:53.297
What's he doing?

41:54.274 --> 41:58.125
This tablet is a key piece of the map
that leads to Paititi.

41:58.188 --> 42:00.688
I've been waiting for this moment,
my whole life.

42:00.915 --> 42:04.110
And now everything is in
hands of these pirates.

42:25.803 --> 42:30.888
- Well, professor, your turn.
- Never. I prefer to die.

42:35.095 --> 42:37.298
That won't work.

42:38.368 --> 42:41.547
Ok, you win. Leave her alone.

42:46.530 --> 42:50.561
From the black peak, the puma
sees the red star.

42:50.615 --> 42:54.480
In the second moon of the rains, the water's
trail goes over the anaconda's skin ..

42:54.536 --> 42:59.937
But don't trust the solid rock. For
sometimes the alpaca's soft hair is stronger.

43:00.703 --> 43:04.640
The Red Star is Mars
of course, the second moon of rain is, April...

43:04.673 --> 43:07.751
and Mars is in the north-eastern quadrant
during that time.

43:07.798 --> 43:10.595
There is a formation of
basaltic rocks here.

43:10.665 --> 43:13.939
But don't trust the solid rock.

43:14.048 --> 43:16.774
- The babbling of an old shaman.
- Got it.

43:16.845 --> 43:19.626
Let's mobilize. I'll take
Mordon and the professor.

43:19.673 --> 43:21.618
The girl stays as collateral.

43:21.665 --> 43:24.923
If her esteemed father doesn't cooperate,
she's dead, ok?

43:25.917 --> 43:28.714
You better not lay a finger on her!

43:30.062 --> 43:31.882
Sorry, sorry.

43:35.752 --> 43:38.734
- Take care of yourself.
- Max on the case.

43:38.747 --> 43:41.739
Trust me, dearest.

44:19.636 --> 44:22.659
If anything happens to
my father, I'll never forgive myself

44:23.296 --> 44:26.342
I got into archaeology so
I could be closer to him.

44:26.374 --> 44:28.248
We'll get out of here, trust me.

44:28.474 --> 44:33.013
Don't trust the solid rock for
sometimes the alpaca's soft hair is stronger.

44:33.412 --> 44:37.279
My father wouldn't ignore something like
that. What he was trying to tell me?

44:47.038 --> 44:49.171
Don't even think about it, Freddy.

44:49.818 --> 44:53.138
Of course not boss lady. I am
a businessman, not a thief.

44:54.123 --> 44:56.795
And this is good business.

44:58.167 --> 45:00.862
Check this out, there's something back there.

45:01.488 --> 45:05.456
- Behind the wall?
- This is not a wall, This is a door.

45:05.973 --> 45:08.336
Believe me, I know what
I am talking about.

45:08.664 --> 45:11.389
That's it. Don't trust the
solid rock.

45:11.552 --> 45:13.736
The tablet was just
the key to open it.

45:14.186 --> 45:15.693
Help me Sara.

45:27.494 --> 45:29.523
Freddy, can we get a hand here?

45:29.593 --> 45:32.431
In a minute, I'm doing an inventory.

45:52.766 --> 45:56.879
But, don't trust the solid rock for
sometimes the alpaca's soft hair is stronger.

45:57.159 --> 45:58.940
This is alpaca wool.

45:59.272 --> 46:01.635
And this is the real map to Paititi.

46:01.797 --> 46:03.785
This is what my father
was trying to say.

46:04.060 --> 46:08.285
- So the Odysseus guys
- ... are going to dig in the wrong place.

46:08.945 --> 46:10.801
Well done Professor.

46:15.074 --> 46:17.217
Hey buddy, how did you get in here?

46:18.559 --> 46:22.059
Wait a minute, if your here
it means there has to be a way out

46:23.878 --> 46:25.465
It's that way?

46:40.858 --> 46:43.825
- What the...? -
- I didn't touch anything.

46:47.378 --> 46:49.690
Jeff, we have to find a way out.
Hurry!

46:49.996 --> 46:53.511
And I have to decifer the map.
Freddy do something, help Tad.

46:53.947 --> 46:56.072
Thank goodness, I never
leave home without this.

46:56.453 --> 46:58.040
What's that?

46:58.066 --> 47:01.641
101 ways of how to avoid a
dying a horrible, miserable, excruciating, painful death.

47:02.124 --> 47:04.649
Step one, determine the level of visible risk.

47:04.705 --> 47:07.105
Are you seriously about to die?
Or just over-reacting?

47:07.510 --> 47:09.792
Yes, we are over-reacting. Come on.

47:10.325 --> 47:13.666
The serpent and the tree, that's it.
The snake's a river.

47:13.817 --> 47:16.091
Step two remain calm.
Don't panic.

47:16.179 --> 47:18.388
Panic leads to hysteria
hysteria and leads to

47:18.401 --> 47:20.621
desperation, and
brings no solution.

47:20.970 --> 47:23.639
Dah, Is there anything actually useful
in that book?

47:24.693 --> 47:28.856
- Step three, think outside the box
- I would if we could get outside the box

47:29.613 --> 47:31.588
Wait, I think Jeff has found...

47:33.298 --> 47:35.117
The way out..

47:37.509 --> 47:40.969
Spirals symbolize the air.
Air, wind. That's it!

47:41.151 --> 47:43.857
Come on Jeff, focus.
Step one, stay calm.

47:44.222 --> 47:47.043
- That was step two.
- Ok, step two.

47:47.144 --> 47:50.288
You can't go on to second two,
without doing step one first.

47:50.773 --> 47:52.817
And what was step one?

47:53.459 --> 47:55.821
I'll have a look. all this excitement, I...

47:56.122 --> 48:00.277
Trees are the earth, the river's water.
Earth, water, wind and fire.

48:00.391 --> 48:03.149
- The mother of nature.
- Step one.

48:03.191 --> 48:05.491
Forget it. Jeff, please
we have no time!

48:10.871 --> 48:13.285
- Has the mut found the escape?
- I hope so.

48:16.400 --> 48:17.919
Way to go Jeff.

48:17.944 --> 48:21.425
Step Four: If you find the exit.
Use it.

48:21.485 --> 48:24.728
Yes, yes, all the symbols
point to the jungle.

48:24.820 --> 48:28.691
Odessus are digging in the desert.
I know where Paititi is, I know it.

48:28.716 --> 48:30.349
Come on Sarah, let's get out of here.

48:46.178 --> 48:50.096
- Well done Jeff, you did it, buddy..
- You're the best.

48:53.796 --> 48:56.809
Hey, Belzoni. You're still
in one piece?

48:58.754 --> 49:00.810
You love her too, don't you?

49:04.647 --> 49:08.834
Ok step five, if escape is successful.
Turn around and go home.

49:09.459 --> 49:11.766
- What?
- Yes, I've had enough.

49:12.446 --> 49:15.478
We can't go now. The
golden statue mustn’t...

49:15.510 --> 49:17.535
fall into the hands of Odessus.

49:18.220 --> 49:19.928
Well if I could get a big bonus for...

49:19.941 --> 49:21.661
working in these terrible
conditions...

49:23.624 --> 49:25.129
Is that a "no"?

49:25.161 --> 49:27.055
We need to move fast
before Kopponen

49:27.068 --> 49:28.973
realizes they're
digging in the wrong place.

49:30.032 --> 49:32.357
Freddy, can you drive
an excavator?

49:32.689 --> 49:34.899
$ 35 per hour, plus
20 cents a mile..

49:34.912 --> 49:37.132
Forget him, I'm an expert.

49:50.421 --> 49:52.096
Hop on..

50:04.245 --> 50:07.552
- How'd you learn to drive this thing?
- Oh in the metro works..

50:09.154 --> 50:12.029
- The metro works?
- Yeah.

50:12.791 --> 50:15.987
- Sara Look, the truth is...
- You worked on the Metropolitan Museum...

50:16.087 --> 50:17.819
excavation project?

50:19.294 --> 50:23.003
Wow. I'm impressed. They
only choose the best.

50:23.762 --> 50:25.806
Yeah, that's how I roll.

50:36.196 --> 50:39.632
No mother you can't die now.
You haven't finished your will yet.

50:39.694 --> 50:44.957
- Hold on mother! Be strong.
- You'e right. Freddy, this series is great.

51:30.059 --> 51:33.728
- We'll spend the night here.
- Works for me, amigo.

51:48.967 --> 51:51.817
Don't worry, I'm sure your
father will be alright.

51:52.401 --> 51:54.532
I'm just glad Max is with him.

51:55.937 --> 51:58.793
You must be excited about
marrying Max Morden...

51:59.089 --> 52:01.777
possibly the most
eligible bachelor on earth.

52:02.601 --> 52:06.694
Yeah, he's a good man:
he's funny, handsome, famous...

52:07.764 --> 52:11.202
But he's such a workaholic;
a lot like my dad.

52:12.402 --> 52:17.014
Well I'm sure he'll realize that
being successful can't make you happy

52:17.353 --> 52:19.993
without someone you love to
share it with..

52:20.951 --> 52:22.595
I hope so.

52:23.684 --> 52:26.334
And you? Are you happy?

52:26.687 --> 52:29.699
Sure, I'm living my
dream, of being an archaeologist.

52:30.064 --> 52:33.939
- How could I not be happy?
- I like your attitude.

52:34.568 --> 52:38.605
Most archaeologists I know are only
satisfied making big discoveries...

52:38.686 --> 52:42.173
which if they're really lucky, it only comes
along once in a blue moon.

52:43.039 --> 52:46.520
But you're different.
Are you for real?

52:47.808 --> 52:49.914
Yep, I think so.

52:54.419 --> 52:58.726
We should get some sleep.
We'll have a hard day tomorrow.

53:03.741 --> 53:06.459
Sara, there's something I need
to tell you.

53:08.658 --> 53:10.364
I'm not a real...

53:14.376 --> 53:17.739
- You were saying?
- Never mind.

53:21.527 --> 53:23.033
Good night.

53:44.170 --> 53:48.180
- Hey, you, idiot.
- I think he means to you.

53:48.597 --> 53:51.247
Better go before he turns
you into Chop Suey.

53:56.760 --> 54:00.191
- Are you sure this is the place?
- Of course I'm sure.

54:00.948 --> 54:02.979
And don't call me an idiot.
You gorilla!

54:04.050 --> 54:05.988
...just trying to make it believable.

54:06.674 --> 54:08.899
What if professor Lavrof lied?

54:10.683 --> 54:13.877
Not to me. I'm practically
his son-in-law.

54:14.494 --> 54:17.538
Exactly, he doesn't seem to
be fond of you.

54:17.976 --> 54:22.201
- Are you sure he doesn't suspect?
- Trust me, I'm a celebrity.

54:27.185 --> 54:30.029
According to the
hieroglyphics, this is it

54:30.246 --> 54:32.115
But there aren't any ruins here.

54:32.546 --> 54:35.471
It's been 500 years since
anyone laid foot here

54:35.693 --> 54:37.818
The city must be hidden
under the vegetation.

54:38.022 --> 54:41.490
If my prayers are answered, there will
be pretty much shovels waiting there too.

54:42.153 --> 54:44.947
- Why don't we split up to look for it?
- I agree.

54:45.969 --> 54:47.519
Jeff, come here boy.

54:49.353 --> 54:51.522
Great, another day without customers.

55:05.310 --> 55:08.429
Come on Jeff, nose to the ground.

55:47.527 --> 55:50.811
Tad, watch out. We've seen a puma.

55:51.123 --> 55:53.317
Really? No kidding?

55:56.823 --> 56:00.386
Freddy, give me a hand.
OlA, maistro.

57:57.547 --> 58:01.291
- Guys! Guys! I found it!
- What have you found?

58:01.945 --> 58:03.964
I found the lost city.

58:35.479 --> 58:38.211
24 hours digging and still nothing.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.543
That old coot thinks he
can toy with us?

58:41.735 --> 58:44.541
Make that idiot talk, now!

58:50.083 --> 58:52.345
Oh my God, the symbol of Paititi.

58:57.917 --> 58:59.836
It sounds hollow.

59:08.518 --> 59:10.112
Gotcha.

59:11.324 --> 59:13.286
And I'm not gonna let you go.

59:27.570 --> 59:31.207
- Stop playing with us professor.
- This can't be the right place.

59:47.315 --> 59:49.715
It must be really deep.

59:51.246 --> 59:55.096
One, two, three, four...

01:00:02.068 --> 01:00:05.205
Eleven, twelve, thirteen...

01:00:05.631 --> 01:00:08.459
Wow, must be extremely deep.

01:00:12.556 --> 01:00:14.988
Now what? An earthquake?

01:00:15.033 --> 01:00:17.946
I should have listened to my horoscope.
And that little voice in my head.

01:00:18.113 --> 01:00:20.282
"Do not get out of bed today."

01:00:28.552 --> 01:00:30.614
We are in deep dog poop.

01:00:33.691 --> 01:00:35.466
Sara.

01:00:37.755 --> 01:00:41.711
I read the map, the city is real.
We found the entrance.

01:00:43.978 --> 01:00:48.134
Ok, prepare everything. I want to be entering
that hole in 5 minutes.

01:00:56.453 --> 01:00:59.559
Dearest, thank goodness you're all right.
I was so worried.

01:01:07.324 --> 01:01:09.811
Ok, squad two go down
and clear the area.

01:01:10.055 --> 01:01:11.975
Squad one, get
the girl and the professor.

01:01:12.025 --> 01:01:14.694
Squad Four, take care of
those idiots. Tie them up.

01:01:15.635 --> 01:01:18.079
Don't worry about us.
We'll be alright.

01:01:20.026 --> 01:01:22.632
Hey, put that away from me
I know how to walk.

01:01:31.814 --> 01:01:34.951
Are you stupid? We can't
let these guys live.

01:01:35.784 --> 01:01:39.715
They're no threat, the Peruvian one
is a walking home shopping network.

01:01:39.877 --> 01:01:42.526
And the man in the
hat is a brick layer.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.714
A brick layer?

01:01:45.632 --> 01:01:50.107
I don't care what the help they are. If they
escape, they could compromise the whole plan.

01:01:52.725 --> 01:01:54.568
Coming, my sugar plum.

01:02:25.632 --> 01:02:28.661
- Which one?
- Well, interesting.

01:02:29.022 --> 01:02:32.084
I think, given the position of
the two entries...

01:02:32.647 --> 01:02:36.156
- it's most likely to be...
- Even an idiot would recognize...

01:02:36.314 --> 01:02:38.320
the Incas marks

01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:42.258
The left one.

01:03:00.197 --> 01:03:03.434
Wait, before you kill us, can we
have one last request?

01:03:05.258 --> 01:03:07.770
A super cookie.

01:04:02.958 --> 01:04:05.008
You, get out of there.

01:04:09.636 --> 01:04:11.692
Hey, the birds!

01:04:24.275 --> 01:04:27.425
- That's got to hurt.
- Hasta la vista baby.

01:04:28.773 --> 01:04:31.648
- And now to the temple.
- I'm not going down there.

01:04:31.977 --> 01:04:34.758
They say there are very dead things
in those Inca temples.

01:04:35.018 --> 01:04:37.468
Ok, then stay up here with
Jeff and Belzoni.

01:04:39.131 --> 01:04:41.444
Great idea, boss.
Good luck down there.

01:04:43.199 --> 01:04:45.374
Come on bird brain
let's play poker.

01:05:07.185 --> 01:05:08.735
Help me dad.

01:05:43.508 --> 01:05:45.052
Sara?

01:06:36.255 --> 01:06:37.799
What was that?

01:06:38.684 --> 01:06:42.263
Spirits from the other side.
Inca Spirits protesting the...

01:06:42.363 --> 01:06:44.047
profaning of this place.

01:07:00.852 --> 01:07:02.383
Tad?

01:07:04.359 --> 01:07:07.007
- Don't get any closer.
- Should we kill him?

01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:09.339
- Of course.
- Max?

01:07:09.753 --> 01:07:12.728
- I mean, of course not.
- Of course, "yes".

01:07:12.843 --> 01:07:16.374
He's evil Sara. He ordered those
goons to kill Freddy and me.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.537
I hope you don't believe him.
He is a pathological liar.

01:07:21.619 --> 01:07:24.325
I'm not lying, I
saw you giving the order.

01:07:24.813 --> 01:07:28.788
Oh, so you're not lying? And when
you told Sara you're an archaeologist...

01:07:29.528 --> 01:07:31.247
...you weren’t lying either?

01:07:32.826 --> 01:07:37.550
- Tad, what's he talking about?
- Come on, Professor Stone.

01:07:37.925 --> 01:07:42.403
Tell Sara who you really are. He's
a construction worker.

01:07:42.738 --> 01:07:45.326
A bricklayer. A nobody.

01:07:45.692 --> 01:07:48.686
What? Tad, is that true?

01:07:49.559 --> 01:07:53.497
Ok, yes, he's right, I lied to you.
I'm just a big phony.

01:07:53.653 --> 01:07:55.634
- But you need to know...
- That's enough... Toad.

01:07:55.759 --> 01:07:57.859
Can't we just kill him boss?

01:07:58.416 --> 01:08:00.865
Boss? Max, what's going on?

01:08:01.471 --> 01:08:05.046
We don't have time for this, Max.

01:08:06.252 --> 01:08:09.959
Ok, Ok. Sara look, I'm doing this for me...
For us.

01:08:10.297 --> 01:08:13.691
- For our future.
- You kidnapped my father?

01:08:14.581 --> 01:08:18.381
It was necessary. We were never
planning to harm him.

01:08:19.134 --> 01:08:21.365
You tried to kill Freddy and Tad.

01:08:21.933 --> 01:08:24.670
Well, I can explain.

01:08:39.484 --> 01:08:41.004
Sorry, sorry.

01:08:42.587 --> 01:08:45.643
You're going to regret that.
Kopponen.

01:08:49.082 --> 01:08:51.982
The only thing I regret is the day
I said I'd marry you.

01:08:52.357 --> 01:08:55.214
And to think you were my roll model.
You're a fraud.

01:08:55.502 --> 01:08:57.902
Shut up you monkey. Move.

01:09:30.214 --> 01:09:33.983
How could I be so blind? How could
I fall in love with a guy like that?

01:09:34.885 --> 01:09:37.935
It's not your fault. He fooled me, too.
He's a liar.

01:09:38.496 --> 01:09:41.365
So are you. You've been lying to me
all this time.

01:09:50.975 --> 01:09:53.430
I'm sorry Sarah. I tried
tell you the truth...

01:09:54.109 --> 01:09:56.997
- But, I was afraid you wouldn't...
- Forget Tad, You lied to me.

01:09:57.185 --> 01:09:59.903
I trusted you,
I really trusted you.

01:10:34.121 --> 01:10:36.614
Sara, help me.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.420
- Take my hand.
- Can you pull me up?

01:10:42.466 --> 01:10:47.033
Sure I can, but first tell me if anything
you said about yourself was true.

01:10:49.109 --> 01:10:51.372
I was the Max Mordon's #1 fan.

01:11:08.238 --> 01:11:11.838
This must be the mummies' work.
They're alive, I've seen them.

01:11:12.627 --> 01:11:15.727
Don't be silly. If they were
alive, they wouldn't be mummies.

01:11:15.796 --> 01:11:18.928
- It's a contradiction in terms.
- Whatever they are.

01:11:19.115 --> 01:11:22.997
- They're here. they're cheesed-off.
- Well done monkey.

01:11:24.044 --> 01:11:27.844
You swine, you didn't care that we could
have been killed down there

01:11:28.131 --> 01:11:32.006
To be honest darling, your father
is the one who I really need.

01:11:32.041 --> 01:11:33.650
Now move.

01:12:02.493 --> 01:12:04.305
Look, keepus.

01:12:04.754 --> 01:12:07.247
The Incas used them to
keep track of their supplies.

01:12:07.513 --> 01:12:11.388
White for silver, yellow for
gold and brown for bronze.

01:12:12.986 --> 01:12:16.367
Oh don't look so shocked.
I'm not a total ignoramus.

01:12:17.495 --> 01:12:18.995
So now what?

01:12:19.749 --> 01:12:24.368
Look, there. That has to be the entrance
to the chamber of the golden statue.

01:12:24.650 --> 01:12:26.931
Pulling the right keepu, is
our ticket in.

01:12:27.819 --> 01:12:29.969
Professor, enlighten us.

01:12:30.771 --> 01:12:32.890
Oh sure, like I'm gonna tell you.

01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:35.880
Okay, fine you worthless old fart.

01:12:36.402 --> 01:12:38.227
Yellow is gold.

01:12:47.174 --> 01:12:49.754
The whole room is a booby trap.

01:12:53.945 --> 01:12:55.964
Sara, professor, against the walls.

01:12:56.254 --> 01:12:58.310
- But he does not know what...
- Just do it.

01:13:08.757 --> 01:13:11.701
You idiot! Kopponen, kill him.

01:13:29.676 --> 01:13:32.800
Tad, the red kepu.
That's the right one.

01:13:44.752 --> 01:13:46.271
Sara.

01:14:33.257 --> 01:14:35.164
So long, suckers.

01:14:40.824 --> 01:14:42.468
Dad.

01:14:59.195 --> 01:15:00.776
The golden statue.

01:15:37.607 --> 01:15:39.843
Stop human. The golden idol
is off limits.

01:15:39.856 --> 01:15:42.102
Prepare to die.

01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:49.075
Ok, ok, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

01:15:49.138 --> 01:15:52.225
I protected this statue
for 500 years.

01:15:52.573 --> 01:15:55.136
And you're not going to be
the one who steals it.

01:16:04.867 --> 01:16:07.861
Forgive me, please.
I surrender.

01:16:08.111 --> 01:16:11.799
- Please don't shoot me.
- Shoot you?

01:16:12.851 --> 01:16:14.751
This isn't a gun,
It's just a...

01:16:17.875 --> 01:16:21.462
Now I will get eternal life.

01:16:22.124 --> 01:16:26.765
- Not so fast
- Get lost, Tad Stones.

01:16:26.862 --> 01:16:29.044
Make me, Max "Moron".

01:16:30.274 --> 01:16:32.567
- As you wish.
- Help, He..ll..p.

01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:39.101
- Are you alright sir?
- You're a real life saver.

01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:45.205
This bag, is already dead.

01:17:20.409 --> 01:17:22.678
Do you think you gonna defeat my
new pet?

01:17:46.968 --> 01:17:50.253
- Give it up, Toad.
- Fight me, Mordon.

01:18:06.505 --> 01:18:10.108
- Max no.
- Sara, welcome to the show.

01:18:10.217 --> 01:18:13.454
Today we're squashing a bug.

01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:21.842
This is the last time I have
to worry about you...

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.986
pathetic bricklayer.

01:19:27.486 --> 01:19:29.743
- Yes
- No

01:19:30.184 --> 01:19:32.865
Too bad toad. Looser!

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:37.191
- Now, he's gonna be immortal.
- Don't get any closer, just wait.

01:19:41.332 --> 01:19:44.451
I'm full of life!

01:19:51.541 --> 01:19:54.410
What? What's
happening to me?

01:19:54.998 --> 01:19:58.110
You may be immortal. But
not as you would expect.

01:20:12.086 --> 01:20:15.842
This is the price for
eternal life, Max "Moron".

01:20:16.036 --> 01:20:19.561
No, this can't be.

01:20:19.975 --> 01:20:22.801
- Sara, help me.
- Get away from me.

01:20:23.192 --> 01:20:26.005
Don't worry, you're still quite
handsome for a mummy, really.

01:20:26.351 --> 01:20:28.639
You'll fit in right in here.

01:20:28.652 --> 01:20:30.951
No, no, there must be an
antidote to reverse this curse.

01:20:31.694 --> 01:20:35.850
No, there isn't. This is the reason
why the mummie' s still live.

01:20:36.399 --> 01:20:40.795
Mummies can't be live.
It's a contradiction. In terms.

01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:44.302
Oh, oh, this is great, she's
got mummy issues, too.

01:20:44.503 --> 01:20:46.709
Get some therapy, people.

01:20:48.595 --> 01:20:50.102
Take him here.

01:20:51.595 --> 01:20:54.382
Don't even think about it, Toad.

01:20:54.993 --> 01:20:57.324
My name is Tad.

01:21:00.959 --> 01:21:04.977
- What are you gonna do, kill him?
- Pretty pointless if you to think about it.

01:21:18.749 --> 01:21:23.374
Oh my God, the treasure of the Incas.
It is rich!

01:21:28.693 --> 01:21:32.999
Take him to our darkest cell.
He'll enjoy eternal jail.

01:21:33.379 --> 01:21:35.704
What? No, no.

01:21:36.062 --> 01:21:40.518
Who do you think you are talking to?
You can't do that. I'm Max Mordon...

01:21:40.606 --> 01:21:43.275
I am the most famous
archaeologist in the world!

01:21:57.529 --> 01:21:59.491
What are you planning on doing with us?

01:22:00.026 --> 01:22:02.814
According to the manual,
You should become a mummy...

01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:04.469
or die.

01:22:04.797 --> 01:22:08.422
- Hey, I saved your life.
- But rules are rules.

01:22:08.796 --> 01:22:12.989
If I let you go, could you guarantee me
you'll let us live in peace?

01:22:21.911 --> 01:22:26.524
This is my most valuable treasure.
It belonged to my father.

01:22:28.809 --> 01:22:30.578
Please take it.

01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:34.340
This is my promise; no one will
ever find out about this place.

01:22:45.303 --> 01:22:46.934
Keep it safe.

01:22:53.519 --> 01:22:56.363
You're the best living people
I've ever met.

01:23:06.423 --> 01:23:08.923
Well, this is goodbye.

01:23:10.102 --> 01:23:13.306
- Have a good life.
- You too, I mean...

01:23:13.307 --> 01:23:15.621
You know what I mean.

01:23:43.451 --> 01:23:46.726
A mute parrot who is
also a card shark?

01:23:47.074 --> 01:23:50.726
I must be cursed.
Now I have nothing, nothing!

01:23:51.256 --> 01:23:53.924
- Money isn't everything.
- I am too broke to believe that.

01:23:55.695 --> 01:23:57.201
Hey buddy.

01:23:58.411 --> 01:24:01.348
Hey guys, you're back.
And alive!

01:24:01.721 --> 01:24:05.296
- What happened to the bad guys?
- They... gone.

01:24:05.969 --> 01:24:08.312
We didn't find anything.
Everything's over.

01:24:08.834 --> 01:24:11.428
What about the golden state?
And the treasure?

01:24:12.115 --> 01:24:17.484
I afraid the legend of Paititi will
be keep being a legend for a long time.

01:24:18.391 --> 01:24:22.378
So it was all for nothing?
We are not going to be rich and famous?

01:24:22.861 --> 01:24:26.368
There's no need to be rich and famous
Freddy. There are better treasures.

01:24:26.941 --> 01:24:28.801
The best one, is being
with the people you love.

01:24:28.814 --> 01:24:30.685
Blah, blah, whatever you say.

01:24:31.274 --> 01:24:34.453
How will I explain to my family that
I've travelled a 1000 miles...

01:24:34.522 --> 01:24:36.997
just only to sell a stinking Swiss pincher?

01:24:39.565 --> 01:24:41.865
Hey, I liked that Swiss pincher.

01:24:47.538 --> 01:24:49.181
Hey, are you ok?

01:24:49.915 --> 01:24:51.833
Yeah.

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:54.721
The Lost City remains lost.

01:24:55.731 --> 01:24:58.075
By the way, we found so much more.

01:25:00.343 --> 01:25:04.287
Sorry about Max. It's not going to be
easy to find another true hero.

01:25:06.083 --> 01:25:10.140
- I already have.
- Really? Who?

01:25:13.063 --> 01:25:15.838
Stones. Tad Stones.

01:25:17.819 --> 01:25:21.907
- I dig you Sara.
- I dig you too, Tad.

01:25:36.871 --> 01:25:40.763
Yo Jeff, through thick and thin,
huh buddy. Fetch.
