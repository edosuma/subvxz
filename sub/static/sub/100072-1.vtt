Why did everyone

00:41.040 --> 00:43.625
I'm afraid we have
troubling news.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.587
Due to budget cuts, we'll
be laying off one employee.

00:46.588 --> 00:49.173
(indistinct murmuring)

00:49.174 --> 00:51.341
The Internet pretty much
only lets us fire white males,

so if you're not
a white male, you're safe.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.680
- So, is Derek Jeter safe?
- Safe!

00:56.681 --> 00:58.223
- What?
- He's half black.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.725
-What?
What do you need, glasses?
-No, I don't need glasses.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.018
-He's white by a mile. He tucks
-You're the one
who needs glasses.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.187
- his T-shirts into his pants.
- A lot of people do that.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.688
- And what happened to this kind
of coach-umpire confrontation?
- It's a body temperature issue.

01:04.688 --> 01:06.774
-I know, I miss it, too.
-It used to happen a lot
in the '70s

01:06.775 --> 01:08.734
-but doesn't seem to happen that
much anymore. It's a connection
-Replay has really taken a lot

settled their differences
-of intimacy out of the game.

-I agree. That's what
we're doing now.

-And while we're
talking about stuff,

01:16.451 --> 01:18.494
- I've never cleaned
my ice trays.
- Oh, you have to do that.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.537
- Why do I have to?
- You're poisoning your family.

01:20.538 --> 01:22.998
-It's just water and water.
What's the big deal?
-Carrying an ice tray

01:22.999 --> 01:24.958

is like ringing

01:24.959 --> 01:26.251

-Of course they're

- Clean your trays.

Oh, cool off, Griffin.
It is no big deal.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.304

someone's getting fired

01:37.305 --> 01:40.098

- Well, that sounds fine.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.476

What?!

01:42.477 --> 01:44.061
Old joke. You're out.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.605
-Old joke?
I put my own twist on it.
-There was no twist.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.149
- Oh, you're crazy. It was
a tip of the hat to my son.
- I'm crazy? You're lazy.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.693
- If anything, it's a gift
to our long-time viewers.
- Oh, what a gift.

"Also, aren't you dead?

20:37.444 --> 20:39.695
"And why did your large wife

20:39.696 --> 20:41.656
"hide your body
from your children?"

20:41.657 --> 20:45.409
Well, the answer to your first
question is a resounding yes.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.912
Christopher Cross
is a perfect gentleman.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.413
And as for the second question,

20:49.414 --> 20:50.665
you're correct, Melanie.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.291
I'm extremely dead,

20:52.292 --> 20:54.919
and I do wish my children
could have closure.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.380
Honey,
if you're listening, please,

20:57.381 --> 21:00.174
just put my body in the ground.

21:00.175 --> 21:02.386
And now back to the countdown.
