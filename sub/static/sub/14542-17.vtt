00:02.760 --> 00:04.319
<i>Previously on Revolution...</i>

00:04.520 --> 00:07.558
- Where are we gonna pick them up?
- A warlord <i>named</i> Duncan Page.

00:07.720 --> 00:10.758
They don't take orders from you.
They take orders from her.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.837
Take the guys
and go get your Patriots.

00:13.600 --> 00:16.638
The Willoughby reeducation center
is up and running, sir.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.554
That boot camp is one
of the most important ones we've got.

00:19.720 --> 00:23.793
<i>Monroe and Matheson are at large
around the very same camp.</i>

00:24.040 --> 00:25.997
- Face down. Now.
- What's going on?

00:26.200 --> 00:27.873
They're from the boot camp,
spying on us.

00:28.040 --> 00:31.920
What's the point of saving this town
if we have to murder its children to do it?

00:32.080 --> 00:34.356
Now they're the town's kids.
Next week they're Patriots.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.033
Looks like trouble in paradise.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.396
<i>Doyle's sending men out by the dozen
searching for Monroe.</i>

00:38.600 --> 00:40.113
They don't know where he is.
I do.

00:40.280 --> 00:44.069
Give me a squad of your best men
and let's get Monroe ourselves.

00:44.240 --> 00:44.991
(GUN COCKS)

00:45.120 --> 00:47.077
- Kim?
- I'm just bringing her home.

00:47.240 --> 00:50.790
Some kind of number tattooed here.
50207.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.359
- What the hell are they--
-(GUNSHOT)

00:53.960 --> 00:56.349
Easy, easy, easy, easy.
No, no, no, no, no!

00:56.600 --> 00:57.590
Move, move, move!

00:59.400 --> 01:01.198
Hey, it's okay.
Let me help you.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.119
Miles!

01:03.800 --> 01:05.120
Please.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.119
Monroe: You didn't shoot the kid,
and now he's leading them right to us.

01:44.320 --> 01:47.358
- Miles: Thank you, Captain Obvious.
- What's going on?

01:49.240 --> 01:52.119
The bad news is the Patriots
found our last safe house.

01:52.320 --> 01:56.200
It's a matter of time before they find us.
But there's good news. Right, Miles?

01:57.800 --> 02:01.156
He let the kid go, so we can die
with a clean conscience.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.832
Miles: Yeah, I'm really sorry.

02:04.440 --> 02:08.638
Sorry I made it harder for you and your kid
to get your discount empire back.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.951
Oh, you didn't think we knew.
We do.

02:13.200 --> 02:17.114
For the last three days,
all we've done is run and hide.

02:17.320 --> 02:20.358
- We gotta hit the boot camp.
- Miles: We don't have enough guys.

02:20.520 --> 02:23.034
- They tripled security.
- Because you let the kid go!

02:23.480 --> 02:24.675
And he told them everything.

02:26.120 --> 02:29.238
- Dad. Dad, where are you going?
-lnto Willoughby.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.550
- Why?
- I can't listen to another second

02:31.680 --> 02:36.356
of these two bickering like sorority girls.
I'm gonna get us help from town.

02:37.160 --> 02:39.071
- Help we can trust.
-(SCOFFS)

02:39.320 --> 02:41.914
After all the times
I saved your puckered ass.

02:42.920 --> 02:44.274
Grandpa, it's too dangerous.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.432
And we need men,
not a bunch of hicks.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.551
Miles, you said yourself
we need more people.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.477
Well, these are my people.
They are good people.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.193
They'll fight, trust me.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.631
What makes you think
we can trust them?

02:54.840 --> 02:56.353
Aren't they a little drunk
on the Patriot Kool-Aid?

02:56.520 --> 02:59.592
We talk to them.
Show them what's happening to their kids.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.559
- They'll do the right thing.
- Yeah? Really?

03:03.240 --> 03:07.393
When you were working
for creepy Uncle Sam, you knew the truth.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.155
Did you do the right thing?

03:12.240 --> 03:12.911
No.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.192
But I'm trying to now.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.390
I'll go with you.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.989
- No. No.
- Yeah, me too.

03:25.160 --> 03:29.597
No. Both of you are staying here.
I'll take him in.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.031
If he's gonna walk into Berlin,
he needs a military escort.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.077
That's great, Miles.
That's awesome.

03:35.280 --> 03:38.750
First, we lose AARP here,
and now we lose you.

03:39.480 --> 03:44.031
You got a better idea, Bass,
aside from standing here bitching?

03:45.200 --> 03:47.430
Cos I'd love to hear it.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.354
No? 0K8)'-

04:03.920 --> 04:06.036
(GRUNTING)

04:36.680 --> 04:40.469
That's Doug Friedman and Steve Hein.

04:40.680 --> 04:45.470
Nice armbands.
We just crashed a Nazi dance party.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.473
This should be easy.

04:54.640 --> 04:58.031
TOM: You know what I admire about you?
Your mask.

04:58.320 --> 05:03.349
It's genial and a bit bland. You would've
made a great game show host.

05:05.480 --> 05:09.838
People either trust you,
or they outright dismiss you.

05:10.520 --> 05:14.559
It's a good mask,
but I see beneath it.

05:15.640 --> 05:22.478
- And what do you see?
- Squirming, conniving ambition.

05:24.080 --> 05:31.316
I mean that as a compliment.
But what I don't get, here's a man

05:31.480 --> 05:37.999
who's willing to poison a whole town
with some filthy plague

05:38.160 --> 05:43.439
to advance his position an inch,
but unwilling to poison a single man

05:43.600 --> 05:45.113
to advance his position a mile.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.199
It's the chief of staff.

05:51.480 --> 05:56.998
One, not my first rodeo.
Two, Doyle is not the man

05:57.160 --> 05:59.913
who should be running this show.
You are.

06:01.320 --> 06:06.349
The brass ring is right there.
All you have to do is grab it.

06:22.200 --> 06:25.750
You boys look at me like that,
you better be ready to buy me dinner.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.879
- Doyle wants to see you.
-(LAUGHS) Sorry, I'm busy right now.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.758
Maybe another time.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.991
Closing a little early aren't you, Marion?

07:19.200 --> 07:21.396
(PANTING)

07:21.600 --> 07:28.438
Well, if it isn't Stu Redman.
Or is it Miles Matheson?

07:30.800 --> 07:32.552
What are you doing here, Gene?

07:32.880 --> 07:35.679
- We just want to talk.
- Really?

07:36.440 --> 07:38.909
Is that why you're both
armed to the teeth?

07:40.400 --> 07:43.279
No one's gonna hurt you, Marion.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.557
Put it down, Miles.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.393
- How about no?
- Miles. Put it down.

08:14.520 --> 08:15.874
What do you want?

08:16.360 --> 08:22.993
- Look, the people in town... They trust you.
- Yeah, they used to trust you, too.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.630
- Used to.
- I need you to listen to me.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.549
- Talk to the others--
- And crap.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.397
(GRUNTING)

08:39.799 --> 08:41.916
Let me go!

08:42.480 --> 08:47.350
What are you gonna do, kill me?
Huh? Blow up my bar?

08:48.000 --> 08:51.595
- Marion.
- The things you've done.

08:53.240 --> 08:57.473
To your own people.
How could you?

08:58.040 --> 09:00.998
- What they're telling you, it's a lie.
- I've seen the proof.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.674
- Proof?
- Yeah.

09:03.080 --> 09:08.314
Truman spoke to everyone.
He showed us the explosives in your house.

09:08.880 --> 09:13.192
He showed us your damn journal.
It's crazy.

09:14.440 --> 09:18.354
There are no explosives.
I have never kept a journal.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.917
The Patriots made all that up.

09:21.200 --> 09:25.273
Everything that has happened to this town
since they got here, it's all them.

09:25.720 --> 09:29.031
The war clan, the typhus.

09:29.200 --> 09:35.230
Right. And that's not crazy?
You're paranoid.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.669
It's not paranoia if they're actually
out to get you, sweetheart.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.398
Just kill me or let me go.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.150
It's the kids. Marion!

09:50.800 --> 09:57.069
That training camp, outside of town.
All the town's kids, they're...

09:58.640 --> 10:03.316
They're doing something to their heads.
You know Kim Carson. She was a cadet.

10:05.280 --> 10:09.990
We saw her kill her father
and then she killed herself.

10:16.800 --> 10:20.350
Grant and Kim aren't dead.
I would've heard.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.798
You know me, Marion.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.353
How many years were we together?

10:30.320 --> 10:36.032
Like together?
Good for you, Gene.

10:42.320 --> 10:44.550
You always said
you could read me like a book.

10:48.160 --> 10:52.472
Look at me.
Am I telling the truth now?

10:57.200 --> 10:59.555
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

11:03.400 --> 11:07.917
- You expecting somebody?
- It's why I closed early.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.673
Marion!

11:21.200 --> 11:22.474
Marion?

11:28.080 --> 11:29.070
Miles: It's Truman.

11:30.280 --> 11:33.159
- What the hell's he doing here?
- He's here for dinner.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.034
Same as every night.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.233
You and Truman?

11:40.320 --> 11:42.675
Wow, Marion.
You really get around.

11:45.880 --> 11:49.316
I have to go up there,
or else he'll suspect something.

12:01.320 --> 12:05.632
If I meant anything to you,
don't tell him.

12:18.080 --> 12:23.029
You know what I could use right now?
My frigging sword.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.639
There you are.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.279
Where were you?

12:37.880 --> 12:39.632
I had to get us a bottle.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.599
Tonight I could use it.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.718
You really know how to pick them.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.757
(CHUCKLES)

13:18.280 --> 13:20.590
Tell me, what's so funny?

13:21.040 --> 13:23.111
I'm just picturing you and Monroe.

13:24.440 --> 13:27.956
Were you thinking matching thrones?
I think that'd be adorable.

13:30.320 --> 13:34.917
I mean, let's be realistic.
You're a skinny-ass nobody,

13:35.200 --> 13:39.433
Monroe's the world's heavyweight psycho.
So".ldunno.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.515
Don't you think you're in
over your head a little bit?

13:43.320 --> 13:47.553
You don't know me.
What I did back home.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.676
Maybe I'm finally
where I'm supposed to be.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.555
Ever thought of that?

14:01.760 --> 14:02.989
What's that?

14:17.040 --> 14:19.714
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

14:41.440 --> 14:42.760
What are you doing?

14:43.080 --> 14:45.959
Hey. Hey!

14:46.200 --> 14:50.080
Vincent! Where you been?
It's good to see you!

14:58.640 --> 15:00.631
Hey, you're Monroe.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.275
Yeah, that's right.
You're Duncan Page's men.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.754
What's left of them.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.154
Monroe: Where's Duncan?

15:09.280 --> 15:10.600
She's dead.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.514
How?

15:19.880 --> 15:23.669
Those dicks in khaki, that's how.

15:24.680 --> 15:28.674
The Patriots.
And we want blood.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.439
Well, you came to the right place.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.152
Is that really necessary?

15:54.160 --> 15:57.994
Gold's gold. It's not like
they're not gonna need it anymore.

15:58.560 --> 15:59.994
Monroe: Tell me what happened.

16:02.480 --> 16:06.951
After you left Vegas,
those Patriots hit us, hard.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.479
Word is they're taking out
every war clan they can find,

16:11.120 --> 16:13.919
trying to bring
some civilization to the plains.

16:14.960 --> 16:18.351
- This is all that's left?
- Duncan fought like hell, but...

16:21.240 --> 16:25.029
They blew her face clean off.
I saw it happen.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.998
Her and half the tribe.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.158
That's why we're here,
to find you.

16:31.520 --> 16:35.354
Duncan said you were here,
killing those US sons of bitches.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.158
That's right.
Yeah, we're trying.

16:39.480 --> 16:43.474
So you're in charge
of this little war party?

16:43.680 --> 16:45.114
I don't want to be.

16:46.240 --> 16:50.393
I make a damn good Indian,
but I'm no chief.

16:51.520 --> 16:52.919
Monroe: Well, that makes sense.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.712
After all, you need
a leader with experience.

16:59.640 --> 17:06.397
You came to Duncan asking for men.
Well, you got them.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.912
She ever cook like that for you?

17:38.760 --> 17:40.592
How long were you two
together, anyway?

17:42.760 --> 17:46.674
It was after Charlotte died.
I was alone.

17:48.680 --> 17:54.198
So, I guess this makes
you and Truman related.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.350
If they don't kill you, I'm gonna.

18:10.440 --> 18:11.874
What are you doing?

18:14.320 --> 18:18.439
Looking for something to fight with
for when Marion sells us out.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.354
Maybe she won't.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.276
Or maybe she definitely will.

18:24.840 --> 18:27.116
How have you not
figured this out yet?

18:28.440 --> 18:34.436
People always do the stupid, selfish thing
ten times outta ten.

18:37.160 --> 18:38.798
So why are you here?

18:40.800 --> 18:43.269
- I'm babysitting your dumb ass.
- No, I mean...

18:44.480 --> 18:48.189
Why are you here?
If everyone's a selfish idiot...

18:49.200 --> 18:51.032
...why are you fighting for them?

18:51.320 --> 18:54.119
I'm fighting
to keep your girls alive.

18:54.360 --> 18:59.992
I appreciate it. I've even made
a certain peace with you and Rachel

19:00.200 --> 19:04.751
but I'm talking
about something bigger.

19:05.680 --> 19:11.517
Don't you want to make things...
I don't know. Better?

19:12.280 --> 19:15.318
News flash.
It's the apocalypse.

19:15.840 --> 19:19.071
- Things are only getting worse.
- What makes you so sure?

19:21.760 --> 19:26.470
- I'm serious. Tell me.
- I've been down this road before.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.829
All right?

19:29.760 --> 19:33.435
I set out to make things better.
Bass and I both did.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.754
And it all went to hell.

19:39.200 --> 19:45.151
It's blood and war.
And you want to know why?

19:48.360 --> 19:52.240
Because people will
always do the stupid, selfish thing.

19:56.240 --> 20:00.871
Me most of all.
I'm just trying to make up for that.

20:01.960 --> 20:02.791
That's it.

20:04.640 --> 20:07.758
So you're not fighting for anything?

20:08.480 --> 20:13.759
You're just fighting back
against your own demons?

20:16.600 --> 20:18.511
No wonder you keep losing.

20:34.360 --> 20:35.680
Hey.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.074
Do you know someone
named Grant Carson?

20:43.040 --> 20:47.159
- Who?
- Grant Carson from outside of town?

20:48.080 --> 20:50.435
His daughter Kim is
one of the cadets in your boot camp.

20:53.400 --> 20:57.109
- Yeah.
- He usually hits the bar everyday.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.757
Funny thing is
I haven't seen him around.

21:00.440 --> 21:01.475
It's not like him.

21:03.280 --> 21:06.033
Next time you're up there,
could you ask Kim?

21:07.440 --> 21:09.716
Ask her if she knows
where her father is?

21:13.720 --> 21:16.758
Sure. I could do that.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.873
Let me get you some more.

22:12.680 --> 22:17.231
We hit the camp fast and hard.
That includes the cadets.

22:17.760 --> 22:20.673
But don't torch any intel.
I want to find out exactly what's going on.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.149
You got it.

22:22.760 --> 22:25.912
Hey. This one's for Duncan.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.159
We're ready.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.195
We're moving out!

22:38.400 --> 22:41.279
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

22:41.480 --> 22:46.429
Bass! Don't do this.
Just wait for Miles.

22:46.600 --> 22:49.558
I got the men I need, Rachel.
Don't have to listen to you anymore.

22:54.440 --> 22:57.239
- What are you doing?
- If my guys are going, I'm going too.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.075
Jason?

23:32.600 --> 23:34.238
Jason! Wake up!

23:36.920 --> 23:38.274
Are you okay?

23:40.160 --> 23:41.434
I think so.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.233
Doyle's guys jump you?

23:46.440 --> 23:47.760
I don't remember.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.998
Good. You're awake.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.119
What the hell is this?

23:58.600 --> 24:02.753
This is what I've been waiting for.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.199
You were planning to kill me, Tom.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.833
The president warned you,
stay on the straight and narrow.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.476
But you just couldn't help yourself,
could you?

24:15.560 --> 24:18.712
- You're wrong about me.
- I know about the poison, Tom.

24:20.280 --> 24:21.270
I know everything.

24:21.480 --> 24:24.233
It's Truman who wants
to see you dead, not me.

24:25.120 --> 24:26.952
You've seen the chip
he has on his shoulder.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.352
I was on my way to warn you.

24:31.280 --> 24:33.999
Don't get me wrong,
I will take care of Truman.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.759
So...

24:38.200 --> 24:44.469
How about, for once
in your conniving, pathetic

24:44.720 --> 24:47.997
and very short, little life...

24:50.160 --> 24:51.559
...you level with me.

24:56.680 --> 24:57.954
All right.

25:01.240 --> 25:07.919
The truth is
Julia loved me and hated you.

25:09.560 --> 25:14.350
She told me what a small man you are...

25:15.360 --> 25:17.920
...in every way.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.119
We used to laugh about you.

25:21.240 --> 25:22.355
(LAUGHS)

25:22.480 --> 25:29.318
Yeah, we'd laugh so hard
we were worried we would choke.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.996
How's that for leveling?

25:36.080 --> 25:37.991

25:50.280 --> 25:53.272
- Get your hands off of me.
- Shh, it's okay.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.557
Doyle: All right. See that?

25:57.240 --> 26:03.395
I say that number
and he does anything I say. Anything.

26:07.040 --> 26:10.590
Yeah, he doesn't remember, but...

26:12.920 --> 26:14.957
...he told me everything about you, Tom.

26:16.480 --> 26:19.791
So after I kill you

26:20.760 --> 26:24.594
I'm gonna send orders to Washington
to kill your wife

26:24.760 --> 26:30.073
and then I will use your son
any way I see fit.

26:33.400 --> 26:35.152
Why am I telling you this?

26:37.160 --> 26:42.997
Because, Tom,
as it all fades to black...

26:44.880 --> 26:47.349
...I want your last thought to be...

26:49.720 --> 26:54.556
...I'm the one
who destroyed your family.

are you fellas doing down here?

30:38.160 --> 30:41.710
- Man: We heard a noise, ma'am.
- Marion: What you heard was my distiller.

30:42.600 --> 30:47.151
Why don'y you get yourselves back
upstairs before you break my equipment.

31:07.400 --> 31:13.191
- So, I take it you believe us?
- I don't know what to think. if--

31:16.480 --> 31:20.360
If what you're saying is true,
you've ruined my life. You know that.

31:20.920 --> 31:24.072
Come on. The guy upstairs
isn't exactly a catch.

31:31.400 --> 31:35.758
We're engaged.
He's a kind man.

31:36.120 --> 31:39.795
I always thought he and the Patriots
were bringing it all back.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.277
- But none of it's true.
- Gene.

31:45.960 --> 31:51.831
Look, I'll get you your chance to get
out of here and when I do, take it.

31:54.160 --> 31:55.434

31:59.240 --> 32:02.835
I gotta admit
I was pretty sure you'd turn us in.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.234
Thank you.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.276
One of your men strangle this guy
with his own belt?

32:36.240 --> 32:39.835
- You do a head count on the cadets?
- There's four still unaccounted for.

32:41.400 --> 32:44.119
Maybe the Patriots deployed them
before we got here.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.671
But for what?

32:49.360 --> 32:50.714
What's that?

32:51.200 --> 32:53.077
I found this in a locked drawer.

32:56.160 --> 32:58.037
I don't suppose you speak Arabic?

32:59.120 --> 33:02.909

- Sir.
- What happened?

by Matheson's people.

- Are you sure it was them?
- I saw the Matheson daughter.

- Don't give me that. You killed kids.

- Why?

he's not getting it back.

- Well...

...none of us are gonna be alive
that long anyway.

we stay standing, we keep fighting

You've been watching me and Miles,
the awful things that we do.

37:34.360 --> 37:35.998
How could you be any different?

37:37.200 --> 37:42.036
We made you into this weapon,
this soldier.

You can still have a future.

- Yes.

if you don't have any hope?

You're the scariest person I know,

37:54.080 --> 37:56.276
and you're preaching
sharing and caring?

What are you fighting for?

38:03.680 --> 38:04.829
You.

I guess I'm fighting for you.
I'm fighting so you won't be me.

hit the camp and killed Doyle...

38:44.800 --> 38:47.360
...and I had to hide in the woods
like a common criminal.

38:48.080 --> 38:49.400
That what happened?

38:51.560 --> 38:55.872
It looks to me like Doyle
had two men tied up in here

38:56.040 --> 38:57.951
but they broke loose.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.558
If I were a betting man,

39:00.720 --> 39:04.076
I'd say Doyle had been
strangled with his own belt.

39:07.480 --> 39:09.551
I wonder who those two men
could have been.

39:12.280 --> 39:16.638
Well, you could file
that report to DC.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.955
Or you could file the truth.

39:22.920 --> 39:24.752
And what truth would that be?

39:25.160 --> 39:31.076
Doyle was the victim of a terrorist
that he couldn't handle, but you could.

back in charge of the town again.

- I zigged when I should've zagged.

- What?
- He took a bullet.

- Is there a problem?
- Who told you to hit that camp?

40:41.160 --> 40:43.356
I saw an opportunity. I took it.

40:44.120 --> 40:46.509
What happened, Miles,
you went back into town.

40:46.920 --> 40:49.878
- Those hicks wouldn't help?
- You didn't give them much incentive.

40:50.040 --> 40:53.032
- You shot their children.
- They wouldn't have helped anyway.
