01:15.458 --> 01:17.167
<i>He's late.</i>

01:21.098 --> 01:24.196
<i>That's a bit disrespectful, if you ask me.</i>

01:25.803 --> 01:28.206
<i>A man should never be late...</i>

01:28.405 --> 01:30.638
<i>...for his own death.</i>

01:34.712 --> 01:37.547
<i>But better late than never, I suppose.</i>

02:09.979 --> 02:13.385
A Hoptroff No.9, nonetheless.

02:18.556 --> 02:21.471
<i>Eleven-millimeter climbing rope.</i>

02:22.660 --> 02:25.826
<i>One thousand, one hundred pound
breaking strain.</i>

02:25.996 --> 02:29.094
<i>No room for mistakes in my business.</i>

02:30.333 --> 02:33.169
<i>Not unless you intend on doing a stretch.</i>

02:33.704 --> 02:37.280
<i>That's why when I hit,
I make it look like something it's not.</i>

02:37.675 --> 02:40.591
<i>An accident, or in this case...</i>

02:40.744 --> 02:42.976
- Wait, wait.
- <i>...suicide.</i>

02:43.480 --> 02:44.984
Don't do this.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.398
Do you know who I am?

02:48.552 --> 02:50.294
Yeah, I know who you are, mate.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.530
You're 25 grand.

03:00.798 --> 03:02.142
That's it. Let it out.

03:13.811 --> 03:16.157
<i>I don't see him as a person.</i>

03:17.715 --> 03:20.448
<i>I see him as a brand-new bike.</i>

03:44.307 --> 03:47.143
<i>After a hit, I'm really psyched up.</i>

03:47.310 --> 03:49.657
<i>Getting rid of all that tension
can be a problem.</i>

03:50.080 --> 03:51.948
<i>Some blokes have breakdowns.</i>

03:52.115 --> 03:54.427
- <i>I break people.</i>
- Mr. Fallon.

03:54.585 --> 03:58.502
- Oh, God, I hope you're not here...
- Afraid so, Spence. Here's 50 sheets.

03:58.656 --> 04:01.002
Why don't you and your mate take a break?

04:02.125 --> 04:03.754
Good lad.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.777
<i>This is the Royal.</i>

04:11.935 --> 04:16.206
<i>A detestable den of absolute filth.</i>

04:17.173 --> 04:21.320
<i>This is where the dregs and lowlifes
come to drown their sorrows.</i>

04:21.945 --> 04:23.893
- Hey, you all right, love?
- Get off me.

04:24.081 --> 04:26.576
<i>Oh, look at these scumbags.</i>

04:27.017 --> 04:30.115
<i>There's only one thing
these lot are good for.</i>

04:30.954 --> 04:33.448
<i>And that's a good old-fashioned beating.</i>

04:33.624 --> 04:36.027
- Come on, don't be shy, love. Come on.
- Oi, fat boy.

04:38.128 --> 04:40.235
That some sort of accent?

04:40.631 --> 04:42.624
Or is your mouth just full of spunk?

04:43.200 --> 04:45.638
You fucking what? Knock him out, Bazzer.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.175
Come on, then, you cunt.

05:03.821 --> 05:06.703
<i>This gaggle of scum are nothing
but a pack of street fighters.</i>

05:06.857 --> 05:08.566
<i>No technique.</i>

05:13.530 --> 05:16.446
<i>And I don't just fight people anymore.</i>

05:21.004 --> 05:23.772
<i>I fucking destroy them.</i>

05:39.522 --> 05:40.867
Cheers, love.

05:41.759 --> 05:43.593
Helped me through my PMT.

05:47.865 --> 05:49.665
Here you go, mate.

05:51.869 --> 05:53.281
<i>PMT:</i>

05:53.436 --> 05:56.272
<i>Post-murder tension.</i>

05:58.408 --> 06:01.085
<i>It can be a right bitch.</i>

06:29.506 --> 06:33.276
<i>Now, there are pubs for musicians,
lawyers, bankers, and builders.</i>

06:33.443 --> 06:35.642
<i>This door,
although it doesn't look like much...</i>

06:36.246 --> 06:38.239
<i>...is the entrance to my local:</i>

06:38.782 --> 06:40.080
<i>the Oasis.</i>

06:43.220 --> 06:46.683
<i>This is a pub for hit men,
a watering hole for predators.</i>

06:46.857 --> 06:49.169
How's it going, Colin? All right?

06:49.326 --> 06:53.426
<i>We're in the business of taking lives,
and business is booming.</i>

06:53.597 --> 06:55.761
<i>And like all the locals...</i>

06:55.933 --> 06:58.097
<i>...we have the regulars.</i>

06:59.002 --> 07:00.346
<i>This is Carnage Cliff.</i>

07:00.503 --> 07:03.385
<i>He's also a killer,
but opts for the more brutal...</i>

07:03.540 --> 07:05.374
<i>...butchering-them-with-an-ax style.</i>

07:06.744 --> 07:09.056
<i>Cliff's been driving Scotland Yard crazy
for years.</i>

07:09.780 --> 07:13.185
<i>There's a fine line between a hired
psycho assassin and a serial killer.</i>

07:15.052 --> 07:16.886
<i>Not much call for his style these days...</i>

07:17.054 --> 07:19.457
<i>...except for the odd example killing.</i>

07:19.623 --> 07:21.456
<i>But he's still one of the lads.</i>

07:22.259 --> 07:24.059
Evening, Cliff.

07:27.831 --> 07:29.505
<i>Meet Poison Pete.</i>

07:29.667 --> 07:31.500
<i>He's a filthy, little runt who takes...</i>

07:31.669 --> 07:34.767
<i>...keeping himself to himself
to new heights. Yeah, you guessed it.</i>

07:36.273 --> 07:38.221
<i>He poisons people.</i>

07:42.045 --> 07:45.484
<i>Nobody really likes Pete because he's
got a vocabulary of about 12 words.</i>

07:45.649 --> 07:47.027
<i>And, well, look at him.</i>

07:47.184 --> 07:49.052
<i>Can't say I'm a fan of his style.</i>

07:49.219 --> 07:52.921
<i>It's simple, effective, yeah,
but fucking spineless.</i>

07:53.657 --> 07:56.424
<i>Apparently, even his parents hated him,
so much so...</i>

07:56.594 --> 07:59.156
<i>...that his only bath-time toy was a toaster.</i>

07:59.329 --> 08:03.065
<i>But for our clients,
it's the effective part they're after.</i>

08:03.901 --> 08:04.926
All right, boys?

08:05.102 --> 08:08.200
- <i>Mick and Mac.</i>
- Man, you tripping. What up, Mike?

08:08.371 --> 08:09.875
<i>Ex-Special Forces.</i>

08:10.040 --> 08:11.578
<i>Mac is British SAS.</i>

08:11.742 --> 08:14.179
<i>Mick is a frogman
from the other side of the pond.</i>

08:15.946 --> 08:17.621
<i>These guys are the best of the best.</i>

08:17.815 --> 08:20.765
<i>As highly trained
as any soldiers in the world.</i>

08:20.918 --> 08:25.064
<i>They classed Iraq, Afghanistan and
Syria as being on their holibobs.</i>

08:25.589 --> 08:27.696
<i>They are bona fide war heroes.</i>

08:27.858 --> 08:30.056
<i>Turbocharged soldiers of fortune.</i>

08:30.527 --> 08:32.965
<i>Well, when they're not bickering
over whose nation...</i>

08:33.130 --> 08:35.442
<i>...has the greatest Special Forces, that is.</i>

08:35.599 --> 08:38.936
We've toppled down more dictators
than you've had hot dinners.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.870
What? Nigga, we took out bin Laden, Saddam.

08:42.039 --> 08:43.714
And don't get me started on Hitler.

08:43.874 --> 08:45.947
<i>Their tradecraft is second to none.</i>

08:46.109 --> 08:48.945
<i>Mick and Mac's specialty is
making high-profile hits...</i>

08:49.112 --> 08:50.980
<i>...look like regular street crimes.</i>

08:51.148 --> 08:54.132
<i>The kind the police can't
really be bothered with.</i>

08:55.586 --> 08:57.966
<i>The Special Forces bond is a unique one.</i>

08:58.121 --> 09:00.559
<i>Something us normal folk
can't really appreciate.</i>

09:01.058 --> 09:03.974
<i>And, yeah, their views may be
on other sides of the Atlantic...</i>

09:04.127 --> 09:06.291
<i>...but they are opposite sides
of the same coin.</i>

09:06.463 --> 09:09.903
<i>And as a team,
they are borderline unstoppable.</i>

09:10.868 --> 09:12.496
<i>The Murdering Mercenaries.</i>

09:12.936 --> 09:16.581
Well, if my aunt had bollocks,
she'd be my uncle.

09:16.740 --> 09:18.368
Fuck does that mean?

09:18.809 --> 09:20.073
Michael.

09:20.243 --> 09:21.473
<i>Meet Jane the Ripper.</i>

09:21.645 --> 09:23.593
<i>Now, her tale is as old as time.</i>

09:24.281 --> 09:27.083
<i>She was an American Army brat,
raised in Japan...</i>

09:27.250 --> 09:29.745
<i>...hated her stepdad, loathed authority...</i>

09:29.920 --> 09:32.198
<i>...and ran away from home at 16.</i>

09:32.389 --> 09:36.421
<i>She spent the next decade
under the tutelage of a disgraced ronin.</i>

09:38.796 --> 09:41.438
<i>But that's a story for another time.</i>

09:44.668 --> 09:47.766
<i>Jane lures in her marks
in the most old-fashioned of ways.</i>

09:48.438 --> 09:50.272
<i>She gets them all hot under the collar...</i>

09:50.440 --> 09:52.719
<i>...and when they least expect it...</i>

09:52.910 --> 09:55.188
<i>...she unleashes the fury
like a woman scorned.</i>

09:56.113 --> 09:59.518
<i>She's an expert swordswoman
and a right nasty bitch.</i>

10:00.851 --> 10:02.195
<i>The Honey Trap Killing Machine.</i>

10:05.322 --> 10:08.694
<i>There's a rumor going round she keeps
her male victims' nether regions...</i>

10:08.859 --> 10:11.353
<i>...in a trophy case at home.
If that's true...</i>

10:11.528 --> 10:14.205
<i>...then that is a shitload of cocks
in a cabinet.</i>

10:15.165 --> 10:16.999
<i>All the lads would love to shag her...</i>

10:17.167 --> 10:20.299
<i>...but we're all too scared
we'd never live to tell the tale.</i>

10:21.672 --> 10:23.471
<i>Here we have Finicky Fred.</i>

10:23.641 --> 10:26.408
<i>Nicknamed after his scrupulous
attention to detail...</i>

10:26.577 --> 10:29.412
<i>...his fussy way of life,
his fear of social media...</i>

10:29.580 --> 10:32.051
<i>...and a tendency to only eat beige food.</i>

10:32.449 --> 10:35.821
<i>He picks his targets at random
from the telephone directory.</i>

10:35.986 --> 10:38.184
<i>He's what we call a test pilot.</i>

10:38.355 --> 10:40.884
<i>Trying out new and inventive methods
of killing people.</i>

10:44.762 --> 10:48.042
<i>Most of Fred's inventions are complete shite.</i>

10:48.198 --> 10:51.512
<i>But in the late '90s, to hide
a league-match fixing scandal...</i>

10:51.669 --> 10:56.486
<i>...he came up with an ingenious way
to take out an entire football team.</i>

10:57.875 --> 11:00.221
<i>He's been dining on the success ever since.</i>

11:00.377 --> 11:02.724
Nearly poked me eye out there.

11:04.347 --> 11:07.115
Who's up for it this weekend, then, Fred?

11:07.284 --> 11:09.482
Looks like it's a Mr. Dorset.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.636
15 Rogers Avenue in Tooting.

11:14.024 --> 11:15.049
Lucky man.

11:17.127 --> 11:18.539
That a slick new bike, Mike?

11:18.696 --> 11:22.580
<i>This is the landlord,
our minder, the boss, Big Ray.</i>

11:22.733 --> 11:24.270
<i>He's a retired death merchant.</i>

11:24.434 --> 11:26.211
<i>He used to be a right vicious bastard.</i>

11:26.369 --> 11:29.046
<i>But he's happier behind the bar these days.</i>

11:29.206 --> 11:31.701
I'm glad to see that you've ditched
that foreign shite.

11:31.875 --> 11:33.469
Come back to British.

11:33.644 --> 11:36.719
Mike's old motor was a fine piece
of Italian engineering, Ray.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.953
Fuck Europe. Up the Brexit.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.289
Best of British, mate.

11:40.818 --> 11:44.098
A Triumph. In every sense of the word.

11:44.254 --> 11:45.963
So, what you working on at the moment?

11:46.123 --> 11:48.230
Did you know that the anaphylactic shock...

11:48.391 --> 11:50.225
...is becoming more common every day?

11:50.594 --> 11:53.475
- Not really, Fred. No.
- Well, I've been doing some research.

11:53.631 --> 11:55.498
I've found you can be completely...

11:55.666 --> 11:58.069
...non-allergic to something one moment...

11:58.235 --> 12:02.449
...and only a fraction of a second later,
you can be severely allergic to it.

12:02.606 --> 12:04.588
That's a bit like you, Pete.

12:05.643 --> 12:08.923
As in gravely allergic.
Like, you will die from it.

12:09.079 --> 12:11.459
Yes, I think we all know
what "gravely" means, Fred.

12:11.615 --> 12:15.988
Well, one common trigger for this
is a mere sticky plaster.

12:16.153 --> 12:19.160
It can be as quick as changing
a plaster on a cut...

12:19.322 --> 12:21.931
- ...and a new one will kill you.
- Hang on.

12:22.092 --> 12:25.760
So you're telling me that you're gonna
kill people by putting plasters on them.

12:25.929 --> 12:30.382
Exactly. I've just got to do one more
field test to make absolutely sure.

12:30.568 --> 12:32.105
That's where Mr. Dorset comes in.

12:32.269 --> 12:34.764
You do know you're probably
the last person on earth...

12:34.938 --> 12:37.136
...that actually uses a phone book, Fred?

12:37.307 --> 12:40.041
I've never trusted the Internet, Ray.
You know that.

12:40.210 --> 12:43.855
So, basically, you've gone
and weaponized bandages.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.962
Yeah. The irony of it all.

12:47.284 --> 12:49.118
Bollocks. It'll never work.

12:49.486 --> 12:51.833
- How much you want to bet?
- Hundred notes, mate.

12:51.989 --> 12:53.526
You're on.

12:53.691 --> 12:55.228
Hey, Big Ray.

12:55.392 --> 12:59.094
What's the name of the hotel where
the first Singapore Sling was poured?

13:00.030 --> 13:02.912
- How many letters?
- Seven.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.525
Fuck off.

13:05.502 --> 13:06.972
Yeah, that's seven letters.

13:07.605 --> 13:11.374
Come on, man. Help me out with this.
You love your Kindle more than your wife.

13:12.175 --> 13:14.168
That's why I strangled the bitch, isn't it?

13:15.145 --> 13:17.093
Charming, Ray.

13:17.247 --> 13:20.493
Maybe you can put your misogynistic
tendencies aside for one minute...

13:20.651 --> 13:22.518
...and pour me my drink?

13:23.153 --> 13:26.559
Mate, is it wrong of me
to wanna get stuck into Jane?

13:26.724 --> 13:29.731
It's not worth it, bro.
Plus, you'd never make it out alive.

13:29.893 --> 13:33.173
Don't know.
I think it might be worth the crack.

13:34.331 --> 13:37.167
Hey, Jane. How much you charging these days?

13:37.334 --> 13:39.532
Offering any friends-and-family discount?

13:39.703 --> 13:42.744
Are you insinuating
that I'm some kind of a skanky hooker?

13:43.240 --> 13:45.712
Or worse, that we're friends?

13:46.509 --> 13:48.411
All right. Back down, lads.

13:48.579 --> 13:51.654
We all know that Jane is a lady.

14:01.592 --> 14:05.897
Well, as stimulating as this is, boys,
I'm out of here.

14:06.063 --> 14:08.261
Got a 10:00 bang-and-shank.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.265
Y'all misbehave.

14:10.801 --> 14:11.872
See you later, Jane.

14:13.804 --> 14:14.943
Bitches, man.

14:16.173 --> 14:19.055
So, Mike, are you still dating
that model chick?

14:19.209 --> 14:20.986
On and off, mate. You know me.

14:21.178 --> 14:25.928
She's all right, though. Twenty-six, body
of an 18-year-old, brain of a 12-year-old.

14:26.083 --> 14:28.065
- Right up my street.
- Yeah, well...

14:28.218 --> 14:30.086
...a little different than the last one.

14:30.253 --> 14:31.928
Didn't she turn out to be a dyke?

14:32.389 --> 14:34.132
"Dyke" is a bit harsh, Mac.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.273
We live in a tolerant society.

14:36.426 --> 14:37.896
All right, then.

14:38.061 --> 14:39.804
A lesbian, then.

14:39.963 --> 14:42.845
- I'd fuck it.
- Well, you'd fuck anything.

14:43.767 --> 14:45.931
The other one she left you for, mate.

14:46.103 --> 14:48.905
Was she the bloke in the relationship,
or was it Beth?

14:49.072 --> 14:51.270
- One of them always is.
- It was the other one.

14:51.441 --> 14:53.754
What was her name again?
Bob? Something like that?

14:53.911 --> 14:55.984
- Charlie.
- Charlie. There you go.

14:56.146 --> 14:58.310
- Even sounds like a bloke.
- Damn.

14:58.481 --> 15:01.090
You must have really pissed her off.
She switched teams.

15:01.251 --> 15:04.531
Yeah. Weren't you giving her
what she wanted, mate?

15:04.988 --> 15:06.936
Yeah, all right, lads. Give it a rest.

15:07.090 --> 15:08.594
Well, like I've always said:

15:08.759 --> 15:10.957
"Women make you soft."

15:11.595 --> 15:15.296
Always remember the three golden rules:

15:15.465 --> 15:16.878
Never get angry.

15:18.535 --> 15:20.130
Never get involved.

15:20.303 --> 15:22.046
And most importantly...

15:22.239 --> 15:24.107
Never get caught.

15:24.274 --> 15:25.835
Well, I'll drink to that.

15:26.610 --> 15:27.806
Cheers, Ray.

15:29.847 --> 15:31.954
Mikey, my boy.

15:32.115 --> 15:33.710
<i>And this is Milton.</i>

15:33.884 --> 15:35.786
<i>The most important cog in the machine.</i>

15:38.355 --> 15:40.223
<i>Milton's a born-and-bred New Yorker.</i>

15:40.390 --> 15:43.374
<i>But after seeing one too many
Hugh Grant films, moved to London.</i>

15:43.894 --> 15:48.199
<i>And he's trying his best to be
a foppish member of the Mayfair gentry.</i>

15:49.166 --> 15:50.670
<i>He's the firm's front man.</i>

15:50.834 --> 15:52.873
<i>He meets the clients and assigns one of us...</i>

15:53.036 --> 15:55.473
<i>...depending on the style of kill required.</i>

15:55.639 --> 15:59.887
<i>All the information we need
is delivered to us in a KBD.</i>

16:00.043 --> 16:02.082
<i>Kill Brief Dossier.</i>

16:02.780 --> 16:05.696
<i>The kill briefs are delivered to us
on an unfixed negative.</i>

16:05.849 --> 16:07.717
<i>Very</i> Mission: Impossible, <i>I know.</i>

16:07.885 --> 16:11.894
<i>But before Milton came along, we had
a manila envelope full of paperwork.</i>

16:12.055 --> 16:15.905
<i>Too easy to leave lying around for those
less-precise members of the crew.</i>

16:16.660 --> 16:18.038
<i>Not naming any names.</i>

16:18.195 --> 16:19.391
What?

16:19.563 --> 16:22.091
<i>We never know the client.
They don't know who we are.</i>

16:22.299 --> 16:24.531
<i>Keeps everybody sleeping better at night.</i>

16:24.702 --> 16:27.743
<i>And for all that,
cheeky bastard takes 15 percent.</i>

16:27.905 --> 16:30.251
<i>Mind you, Ray takes 25.</i>

16:30.407 --> 16:33.016
<i>And nobody says shit about that.</i>

16:33.711 --> 16:36.057
<i>Everybody secretly wishes
they could kill Milton.</i>

16:36.213 --> 16:37.922
<i>He's a little weasel.</i>

16:38.081 --> 16:40.883
<i>But house rules dictate that no one
can touch him. It's a shame.</i>

16:43.453 --> 16:45.435
<i>So the yuppie job went down well?</i>

16:45.589 --> 16:48.197
Turned out he was suicidal.

16:48.358 --> 16:50.101
Mixing it up a little bit, aren't we?

16:50.260 --> 16:51.798
Yeah, something like that.

16:51.962 --> 16:55.128
And I had another job
that just came in this morning.

16:55.332 --> 16:57.975
The Satanic Mechanics?

16:58.135 --> 17:00.117
- Have you ever heard of them?
- No.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.899
They're a heavy-metal band.

17:02.072 --> 17:05.603
They're gonna be playing
the next four nights at the Mosh Pit.

17:05.776 --> 17:07.644
And, well, they all need to die.

17:07.845 --> 17:10.761
- You think you can handle it?
- I don't see why not.

17:10.914 --> 17:12.906
And what about the accountant job?

17:13.083 --> 17:15.794
It seems like you're falling
a little behind on that one.

17:16.486 --> 17:18.080
All good comes to those who wait.

17:18.255 --> 17:21.661
Yes, but we don't want
to keep them waiting too long.

17:21.858 --> 17:24.991
After all, we have our reputation to uphold.

17:25.162 --> 17:27.634
And these people can be a whale of a client.

17:27.798 --> 17:30.178
If they want it quick,
have Cliff take his head off.

17:30.367 --> 17:33.078
If they want it done legit,
like an accident...

17:33.236 --> 17:36.186
- ...they just have to wait.
- That's exactly what I told them.

17:36.373 --> 17:38.173
But as a little incentive...

17:38.375 --> 17:42.407
...if you can get this job done
by the end of play tomorrow...

17:42.580 --> 17:44.288
...they're willing to double the fee.

17:44.447 --> 17:46.646
- Double the fee?
- Yeah.

17:46.817 --> 17:49.254
- All right, I'll see what I can do.
- Marvelous.

17:49.419 --> 17:51.823
- That's why you're the best.
- Yeah, whatever, Milton.

17:51.989 --> 17:54.598
Probably say that to all the killers.

17:58.095 --> 18:00.373
<i>There was a guy on TV the other night.</i>

18:00.530 --> 18:04.950
<i>Had a theory that nearly a quarter
of all so-called fatal accidents...</i>

18:05.102 --> 18:07.141
<i>...were actually murders.</i>

18:07.304 --> 18:09.411
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

18:10.507 --> 18:12.136
<i>It's only about 10 percent.</i>

18:15.679 --> 18:18.446
<i>For this hit, I'm using
a CO2 gas-powered rifle.</i>

18:18.816 --> 18:21.162
<i>Plastic tube, 2 inches in diameter.</i>

18:21.318 --> 18:24.234
<i>Poly-carbon plunger filled
with shards of glass.</i>

18:24.421 --> 18:26.620
<i>Pinpoint accurate at 500 yards.</i>

18:30.427 --> 18:32.899
<i>I've been here every morning
for the past five days...</i>

18:33.063 --> 18:36.560
<i>...waiting for the right car
at the right speed and the right angle.</i>

18:40.337 --> 18:41.362
<i>Oh, here we go.</i>

18:51.314 --> 18:54.230
<i>Looks like I'll get
my double-price incentive after all.</i>

18:57.087 --> 18:58.716
Oh, my God. I've killed him.

18:58.889 --> 19:02.591
<i>It only takes a metric ton of steel
to sure ruin everyone's day.</i>

19:03.326 --> 19:06.937
<i>When the police investigate, they'll
presume the burst tire was responsible...</i>

19:07.097 --> 19:09.170
<i>...because of the broken glass in the road.</i>

19:09.332 --> 19:10.711
<i>And Bob's your uncle.</i>

19:10.868 --> 19:12.975
<i>Another accident.</i>

19:16.840 --> 19:17.865
I've killed him!

19:27.585 --> 19:29.361
<i>PMT time again.</i>

19:29.519 --> 19:32.766
<i>It's not a good idea to make a habit
of smashing up strangers in bars.</i>

19:32.923 --> 19:34.700
<i>So tonight, this'll have to do.</i>

19:45.736 --> 19:47.535
<i>Why can't I stop thinking about her?</i>

19:50.140 --> 19:52.122
Get it together, son.

20:11.562 --> 20:12.587
<i>Big Ray was right.</i>

20:13.230 --> 20:15.793
<i>I should've never gotten involved.</i>

20:18.636 --> 20:23.841
<i>She used to drive me crazy
with all that eco, save-the-planet rubbish.</i>

20:24.041 --> 20:27.139
<i>"Melting ice caps" this,
"dolphin massacres" that.</i>

20:27.310 --> 20:29.748
<i>One minute we'd be yelling at each other...</i>

20:32.415 --> 20:34.796
<i>...and the next, we'd be all over each other.</i>

20:59.643 --> 21:03.310
I can't believe she left me
for Charlie Adams and a minge.

21:07.885 --> 21:09.560
<i>One new message.</i>

21:09.720 --> 21:11.554
<i>Mikey, Milton here.</i>

21:11.722 --> 21:14.125
<i>Listen, I'm afraid
we've got a bit of a hiccup.</i>

21:14.291 --> 21:18.665
<i>I'm swamped. So I need you to pick up
the payment for the accountant job.</i>

21:18.829 --> 21:22.075
<i>Drop-off will be at the back
of the Odeon Cinema in Chinatown...</i>

21:22.232 --> 21:23.907
<i>...tomorrow night at 9 p.m.</i>

21:24.101 --> 21:26.835
<i>I'll see you at the Oasis, old matey.</i>

21:27.004 --> 21:28.633
Dickhead.

21:39.149 --> 21:41.678
<i>The Satanic Mechanics
are a bit of an acquired taste.</i>

21:43.120 --> 21:45.250
<i>Like someone else's vomit in your mouth.</i>

21:45.422 --> 21:48.031
<i>They can't afford the power breakers
and have been stacking amps...</i>

21:48.191 --> 21:50.230
<i>...and drop the earth wire to kill the hum...</i>

21:50.393 --> 21:53.560
<i>...increasing the risk of fatal accident.</i>

21:53.731 --> 21:56.111
<i>I don't know why the Mechanics had to die.</i>

21:56.266 --> 21:59.364
<i>Could have been a bad debt.
Copyright disputes.</i>

21:59.536 --> 22:02.372
<i>Or maybe someone just hated
their god-awful music.</i>

22:02.539 --> 22:07.688
<i>After listening to three of their tracks,
I'd have fucking done them for free.</i>

22:18.188 --> 22:22.288
<i>As shit as their music is, for some
reason, this reminded me of Beth.</i>

22:22.459 --> 22:25.102
<i>Funny how seemingly everything
can remind you of an ex.</i>

22:50.120 --> 22:52.250
<i>Milton must be letting his standards slip.</i>

22:52.422 --> 22:56.454
<i>A hired gun making his own collection
isn't exactly protocol with our firm.</i>

22:56.627 --> 23:00.396
<i>But as long as I get paid,
I couldn't give a shit.</i>

23:46.043 --> 23:48.720
Guessing you've come here
to snuff me out, then, right?

23:48.879 --> 23:50.952
Tie up some loose ends.

23:56.754 --> 23:58.554
<i>You see, every day's a school day.</i>

23:58.756 --> 24:00.556
<i>And I'm always intrigued by what hurts...</i>

24:00.758 --> 24:01.954
Painful?

24:02.125 --> 24:04.802
<i>...and what really fucking hurts.</i>

24:11.134 --> 24:12.159
How about that?

24:13.470 --> 24:14.576
Painful?

24:15.639 --> 24:18.520
I don't think you really thought this
through, did you, mate?

24:18.676 --> 24:23.379
You could have easily perched on top
of that building there with an M82.50 cal.

24:23.546 --> 24:25.528
Good line of sight, easy exit points.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.667
Or you could have rigged
this whole place with C-4.

24:32.823 --> 24:35.226
Got the job done shock-and-awe style.

24:41.498 --> 24:44.505
But no. You decided to "surprise me"...

24:44.668 --> 24:46.228
...on a not-so-silent motorbike...

24:46.403 --> 24:49.501
...shooting a close-range weapon
in every direction but the right one.

24:49.674 --> 24:51.713
You didn't hit shit, did you?

25:02.586 --> 25:04.419
You're a disgrace to my profession.

25:10.127 --> 25:12.770
What is that, anyway? Southern style?

25:14.231 --> 25:15.701
Come on, then, you little fuck.

25:27.244 --> 25:30.582
Listen, mate. I'm all for the extra training.

25:30.748 --> 25:32.650
I don't think it's gonna do much for you.

25:36.453 --> 25:38.355
That ain't gonna help you much either.

25:47.931 --> 25:50.061
Now, that looked very painful.

25:52.970 --> 25:54.565
Fuck you, <i>gweilo.</i>

25:54.738 --> 25:57.118
I tell you nothing.

25:58.108 --> 25:59.338
Don't worry, mate.

25:59.509 --> 26:01.502
I don't want to know anything.

26:14.825 --> 26:17.103
- <i>Hello?</i>
- The fuck are you playing at, Milton?

26:17.260 --> 26:20.096
- <i>Mikey, is that you?</i>
- Yeah, it's me. Guess what.

26:20.263 --> 26:23.099
Your double-price incentive
turned out to be a fucking setup.

26:23.266 --> 26:25.305
- <i>What are you talking about?</i>
- You heard me.

26:25.469 --> 26:27.542
Knew something wasn't right.
Who's the client?

26:27.705 --> 26:29.607
<i>I can't say, but my apologies.</i>

26:29.773 --> 26:32.176
<i>It seemed like a straightforward request.</i>

26:32.342 --> 26:34.017
Not from where I'm fucking standing.

26:34.177 --> 26:37.514
<i>I'm sorry, Mike. I'll speak to Big Ray.
We'll look into it.</i>

26:37.681 --> 26:40.175
Yeah, but you tell him
the price just quadrupled.

26:40.350 --> 26:42.457
<i>Well, I might not be able to stretch to that.</i>

26:42.620 --> 26:44.966
You better fucking stretch it,
or I'll stretch you.

26:45.122 --> 26:47.468
<i>Now, now, now. Don't be like that.</i>

26:47.625 --> 26:50.575
<i>I'll speak to you tomorrow
when you've calmed down a bit.</i>

26:50.728 --> 26:54.167
Milton. Milt... Oh, you fucking little shit.

26:56.333 --> 26:59.580
<i>I guess this guy shouldn't have
entered the alley so fast.</i>

26:59.737 --> 27:01.536
<i>He lost control of his bike...</i>

27:01.705 --> 27:04.051
<i>...and broke his little neck.</i>

27:04.208 --> 27:06.817
<i>Pretty common accident
with the youth of today.</i>

27:07.477 --> 27:11.418
<i>And as for that car with all the holes
in it, well, what do you expect?</i>

27:11.582 --> 27:15.591
<i>I'm an executioner, not a fucking evangelist.</i>

27:33.103 --> 27:35.051
<i>One new message.</i>

27:35.205 --> 27:37.848
<i>Mike, it's Charlie.</i>

27:38.008 --> 27:40.388
<i>Something happened to Beth.</i>

27:41.178 --> 27:43.855
<i>A couple nights ago,
our flat was broken into.</i>

27:44.014 --> 27:46.691
<i>She must have walked in and surprised them.</i>

27:46.850 --> 27:48.262
<i>Mike...</i>

27:49.386 --> 27:51.015
<i>...Beth's dead.</i>

27:51.555 --> 27:53.115
<i>You probably don't give a shit...</i>

27:53.290 --> 27:56.297
<i>...but the funeral is this Sunday
at West Ham Cemetery.</i>

27:56.493 --> 27:58.567
<i>She would have wanted you to know.</i>

27:58.729 --> 28:01.041
<i>Press two to repeat.</i>

28:01.198 --> 28:03.066
<i>Three to delete.</i>

28:03.233 --> 28:05.591
<i>Five-five to call back.</i>

29:40.097 --> 29:43.229
I know you wouldn't have wanted me
to bring flowers, Beth.

29:44.134 --> 29:46.514
One flower out of the ground
is one less battling...

29:46.670 --> 29:48.537
...against greenhouse gases, right?

29:49.740 --> 29:51.368
I figured.

29:51.541 --> 29:52.715
Screw it.

30:05.723 --> 30:07.021
You're Mike.

30:07.758 --> 30:09.056
Guess you're Charlie.

30:10.127 --> 30:11.836
I didn't think you'd come.

30:14.431 --> 30:16.869
Thought I'd better pay my respects.

30:18.501 --> 30:21.839
Well, from what I've heard, you never
had any respect for anything.

30:22.005 --> 30:23.839
And you certainly never had any for Beth.

30:24.008 --> 30:25.910
Oh, come on, that's not true.

30:27.144 --> 30:30.390
Well, apparently, you weren't
really big on honesty either.

30:36.086 --> 30:37.556
So, what are the police saying?

30:37.721 --> 30:39.703
They been anything other than useless?

30:39.857 --> 30:42.659
Yeah, they found them. Dead.

30:43.794 --> 30:45.422
Couple of junkies.

30:45.596 --> 30:48.728
DNA was splattered all over our apartment.

30:48.899 --> 30:52.031
I guess the money they stole helped pay
for their drug overdose.

30:54.471 --> 30:56.909
Look, there's something that you should know.

30:58.776 --> 31:00.450
She was pregnant.

31:01.912 --> 31:04.224
What are you talking about, pregnant?

31:04.982 --> 31:07.112
- Who?
- It was yours.

31:07.785 --> 31:10.393
- We were gonna raise it as our own.
- Oh, right.

31:10.955 --> 31:14.485
Why's that? So you could have
your little perfect lesbian life together?

31:14.692 --> 31:16.400
And what would be wrong with that?

31:16.560 --> 31:18.393
Nothing, if one of you wasn't my girlfriend.

31:18.563 --> 31:20.157
Ex-girlfriend.

31:20.330 --> 31:22.643
And what would you have done, anyways?

31:22.800 --> 31:24.600
I would have done the right thing.

31:24.768 --> 31:26.602
The right thing would've been
to leave us alone.

31:26.771 --> 31:29.755
There you go, I would have done
the right thing after all.

31:29.907 --> 31:31.855
Who's this? New girlfriend, is it?

31:32.009 --> 31:33.239
Didn't waste much time.

31:33.644 --> 31:36.115
I'm her sister, you dick.

31:36.747 --> 31:40.756
You are exactly how Beth described you.

31:42.419 --> 31:44.253
Clean up your fucking mess.

31:59.136 --> 32:01.209
<i>The prime suspects in the
Beth Carpenter murder investigation...</i>

32:01.371 --> 32:04.014
<i>...have been found dead of a drug overdose.</i>

32:04.174 --> 32:07.124
<i>Brothers Craig and Hayden Sutton
from North Acton...</i>

32:07.277 --> 32:10.979
<i>...both had a history of drug problems
and long criminal records.</i>

32:11.148 --> 32:13.494
<i>They were found dead on Tuesday morning.</i>

32:13.851 --> 32:16.345
<i>Couple of smackheads rape
and murder a young woman.</i>

32:17.755 --> 32:19.292
<i>Then turn up dead of an overdose.</i>

32:19.456 --> 32:20.801
Very fucking convenient.

32:20.958 --> 32:23.190
<i>A police spokesperson said
that Ms. Carpenter...</i>

32:23.360 --> 32:26.401
<i>...had arrived home and disturbed
a burglary in progress.</i>

32:26.830 --> 32:30.144
<i>Beth Carpenter,
a well-known environmental activist...</i>

32:30.300 --> 32:31.861
<i>...was the driving force behind...</i>

32:32.035 --> 32:35.406
<i>...the closure of the Bimeadow
nuclear power facility.</i>

32:35.573 --> 32:39.149
<i>She was a force to be reckoned with
when she wanted to be.</i>

32:40.310 --> 32:43.021
<i>Maybe she pushed too hard this time.</i>

32:45.315 --> 32:46.785
Yeah, it's me.

32:47.517 --> 32:50.046
I need to cash in that favor.

34:03.060 --> 34:04.894
<i>The police dossier says the burglars...</i>

34:05.062 --> 34:07.442
<i>...free-climbed up the wall
to Beth's apartment.</i>

34:07.598 --> 34:09.498
<i>No mean feat.</i>

34:10.134 --> 34:12.777
<i>Then at the window,
they crowbar their way in.</i>

34:12.936 --> 34:14.405
<i>Not impossible...</i>

34:14.572 --> 34:16.473
<i>...but not easy.</i>

34:21.945 --> 34:24.074
<i>Once inside, these two scumbags...</i>

34:24.248 --> 34:27.527
<i>...thought it'd be a good idea to spark up
and smoke some more crack.</i>

34:31.088 --> 34:33.617
<i>And then Beth comes home and disturbs them.</i>

34:34.291 --> 34:36.523
<i>Look how beautiful she is.</i>

34:37.427 --> 34:39.592
<i>Then these burglars decided
to have their fun.</i>

34:42.299 --> 34:45.705
<i>So they rob her,
rape her, knock her unconscious.</i>

34:46.103 --> 34:49.143
<i>And then for good measure,
repeatedly stab her with a bread knife.</i>

34:58.916 --> 35:02.800
<i>So these two drug addicts did all this
for a few household goods...</i>

35:02.953 --> 35:05.333
<i>...and what little money
Beth had in her purse.</i>

35:05.488 --> 35:08.222
<i>Granted, this thing happens a lot.</i>

35:08.425 --> 35:11.068
<i>But something doesn't sit right with me.</i>

35:17.201 --> 35:21.142
<i>Traces of sodium thiopental found
in her postmortem blood work.</i>

35:21.305 --> 35:23.584
<i>Says it was prescribed by a psychiatrist...</i>

35:23.741 --> 35:26.987
<i>...to treat the patient's
pteromerhanophobia...</i>

35:27.144 --> 35:29.342
<i>...the chronic anxiety of flying.</i>

35:30.948 --> 35:32.087
<i>Fear of flying.</i>

35:33.016 --> 35:34.725
<i>Since when?</i>

35:35.953 --> 35:37.946
<i>This must have been a pro outfit.</i>

35:46.530 --> 35:49.059
<i>Sodium thiopental might be used
to treat phobias...</i>

35:49.233 --> 35:52.571
<i>...but in my line of work, it's more
commonly known as truth serum.</i>

35:54.739 --> 35:56.778
<i>These guys made her sing like a canary.</i>

35:58.008 --> 36:00.047
<i>Then they slashed her up indiscriminately...</i>

36:00.210 --> 36:01.589
<i>...to hide the needle marks...</i>

36:01.745 --> 36:04.273
<i>...and littered the scene
with hair and skin samples...</i>

36:04.481 --> 36:06.919
<i>...from a couple of recently OD'd smackheads.</i>

36:07.084 --> 36:09.487
<i>This hit's got
Mick and Mac written all over it.</i>

36:17.261 --> 36:20.302
You fucking bastards.

36:34.244 --> 36:35.440
Hey, Mikey.

36:36.113 --> 36:39.097
- What you doing here, man?
- Heavy night last night, was it?

36:39.617 --> 36:41.610
Look at the state of him.

36:42.086 --> 36:44.068
You don't look too happy, Mike. What's up?

36:44.622 --> 36:46.421
Why don't you take a wild guess?

36:50.127 --> 36:52.804
Beth Carpenter found dead.

36:52.963 --> 36:55.799
Raped. Mutilated.

36:57.568 --> 36:59.401
Ring any bells?

37:03.774 --> 37:05.972
- Sorry for your loss, man.
- Yeah.

37:06.744 --> 37:07.769
Sorry, man.

37:08.478 --> 37:12.328
Toxicology report shows traces
of sodium thiopental in her bloodstream...

37:12.950 --> 37:17.414
...prescribed by some quack she never
mentioned for a phobia she never had.

37:18.288 --> 37:22.502
But I happen to know for a fact
that you two swear by thiopental.

37:22.660 --> 37:25.872
Yeah, so? What are you trying to say, Mike?

37:26.063 --> 37:29.434
So seeing as Beth was pregnant,
there's no way on earth...

37:29.600 --> 37:32.971
...she'd risk endangering that baby
by taking thiopental willingly.

37:35.172 --> 37:36.801
It was you two, wasn't it?

37:37.441 --> 37:39.514
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Hey.

37:40.578 --> 37:42.617
It's all right, Mac.

37:45.182 --> 37:46.959
He ain't stupid.

37:48.352 --> 37:50.824
Okay, you got us.

37:52.022 --> 37:54.015
But, Mike, it was just business.

37:54.191 --> 37:56.298
- Business.
- Come on, man. What's the big deal?

37:56.460 --> 37:59.866
- She wasn't your girl anymore.
- You said you were over that dyke.

38:02.232 --> 38:04.339
You call her a dyke one more fucking time...

38:04.501 --> 38:07.144
Mike. Mike.

38:07.504 --> 38:09.851
Now, you need to step the fuck off.

38:10.007 --> 38:11.305
We don't want to hurt you.

38:11.474 --> 38:15.894
We were doing our jobs, just like
you done a hundred times before.

38:16.046 --> 38:18.483
So stop acting like a little bitch
and go home...

38:18.649 --> 38:21.484
- ...and watch some goddamn cartoons.
- Yeah.

38:22.519 --> 38:24.752
I don't think the odds are
in your favor anyway.

38:25.823 --> 38:27.771
Just like they weren't for that dyke.

40:03.854 --> 40:05.357
<i>Shit, these boys are good.</i>

40:05.522 --> 40:08.324
<i>Best-trained soldiers in the world, bar none.</i>

40:08.491 --> 40:09.938
<i>But I'm not an army man.</i>

40:10.093 --> 40:13.134
<i>And to me, these moves are predictable.</i>

40:15.666 --> 40:17.169
Fuck.

41:21.098 --> 41:23.741
Okay, okay, okay, Mike.

41:23.901 --> 41:26.543
What's the big deal?
Why do you care so goddamn much?

41:26.704 --> 41:28.173
She was pregnant, Mick!

41:28.338 --> 41:29.876
All right?

41:30.908 --> 41:32.890
We didn't know that shit.

41:33.243 --> 41:35.077
Okay, all right.

41:35.245 --> 41:38.229
If it means anything to you,
she didn't feel anything.

41:38.382 --> 41:40.854
That wasn't even our sperm.
We found two crackheads.

41:41.018 --> 41:44.548
We made them jerk off into a turkey
baster. We took that turkey baster...

41:44.722 --> 41:45.895
Shut the fuck up.

41:46.390 --> 41:48.885
Mike, Mike, listen.

41:49.059 --> 41:51.588
If it makes you feel any better,
you can kill my wife.

41:51.762 --> 41:53.835
She's been doing
my fucking head in for years.

41:56.567 --> 41:58.195
Mike, was that shit necessary?

41:58.636 --> 42:01.802
- Can you just try to be professional?
- Who's the client?

42:01.972 --> 42:05.070
- You know we never know that shit.
- Who gave you the brief? Milton?

42:05.242 --> 42:07.235
Of course it was Milton.

42:07.411 --> 42:09.724
Mike, it was a standard kill brief.

42:09.880 --> 42:10.985
This was just business.

42:11.148 --> 42:14.064
And besides, you was already done
with the bitch...

42:14.619 --> 42:16.999
You were already done with the young lady.

42:18.589 --> 42:20.263
Mike.

42:22.627 --> 42:24.620
You lucky I like you, man.

42:25.229 --> 42:27.667
Do yourselves a favor, right?

42:27.865 --> 42:30.359
Stay the fuck away from me.

42:31.468 --> 42:33.006
The both of you.

42:37.775 --> 42:39.119
<i>Mick and Mac are right.</i>

42:39.276 --> 42:42.773
<i>They may have been the triggers,
but they didn't point the gun.</i>

42:42.947 --> 42:45.863
<i>I need to find out
who ordered Beth's hit and why.</i>

42:46.016 --> 42:49.296
<i>And only that little runt Milton
can tell me that.</i>

42:53.523 --> 42:55.425
Not here, Mike.

42:58.629 --> 43:00.975
You're in danger of fucking up, my boy.

43:01.632 --> 43:02.703
How's that?

43:03.400 --> 43:05.143
Read the sign.

43:05.603 --> 43:06.628
Take a seat.

43:07.905 --> 43:09.648
Where is that little fucking weasel?

43:09.807 --> 43:12.119
Never you mind about Milton.

43:12.276 --> 43:14.178
I've just had a phone call.

43:14.344 --> 43:15.517
From Mick.

43:15.980 --> 43:18.542
He's at the doc's.
Mac's getting his jaw wired.

43:18.716 --> 43:21.358
Feel free to jump in at any time
and explain yourself.

43:23.287 --> 43:25.451
You seem pretty unscathed.

43:27.858 --> 43:29.202
Well, I don't bruise easy.

43:29.727 --> 43:31.857
You never did.

43:34.498 --> 43:36.970
It's never personal. You know that.

43:38.969 --> 43:41.531
Mick and Mac had a job to do,
and they fucking did it.

43:41.706 --> 43:43.574
All right? No questions asked.

43:43.741 --> 43:47.807
Milton hired them to take out Beth.
Why did no one consult me about this?

43:48.178 --> 43:50.889
- Did you know?
- No.

43:51.048 --> 43:53.030
I'm just finding out about this
10 minutes ago.

43:53.183 --> 43:54.481
I'm far from happy about it.

43:54.652 --> 43:58.661
But if you've got a problem with this firm,
you come and talk to me first.

43:58.989 --> 44:03.203
How many times have I told you
not to get involved?

44:03.694 --> 44:05.892
She was pregnant, Ray.

44:09.233 --> 44:10.612
The kid was mine.

44:17.407 --> 44:19.002
Well...

44:20.544 --> 44:22.526
...there's a word for that.

44:24.615 --> 44:25.686
"Bollocks."

44:26.283 --> 44:29.746
It's not as if you two were playing
happy families, now, was it?

44:30.721 --> 44:32.794
You stop this right now.

44:33.290 --> 44:34.794
What about Milton?

44:35.259 --> 44:38.357
Two days ago, he sends me
on some dodgy back-alley money drop.

44:38.528 --> 44:41.900
Turned out to be a fucking setup.
Do you know about that?

44:42.532 --> 44:44.572
- No.
- He's up to something, Ray.

44:45.603 --> 44:47.642
He's working an angle way below your radar.

44:47.805 --> 44:50.413
You're too fucking trusting to see it.

44:51.809 --> 44:53.711
Who's the client?

44:54.712 --> 44:57.092
Look, I'm gonna find out.
You might as well tell...

44:57.247 --> 44:58.751
You listen to me.

44:59.617 --> 45:01.997
There are certain things
about this business...

45:02.152 --> 45:04.134
...that we must always respect...

45:04.288 --> 45:06.327
...whether we like it or not.

45:07.057 --> 45:10.588
We do not ask questions about the client.

45:11.028 --> 45:12.531
Never.

45:14.264 --> 45:16.645
It's about time things changed around here.

45:16.801 --> 45:19.967
Don't you disrespect me, boy!

45:21.972 --> 45:25.411
Now, you and I go back a long way, Mike.

45:26.577 --> 45:29.652
I know you're hurting.

45:37.087 --> 45:39.821
But you get your shit together...

45:39.990 --> 45:42.553
...and you get back onboard.

45:45.495 --> 45:47.569
Are we cool?

45:48.766 --> 45:50.600
<i>Not a lot of people know about...</i>

45:50.768 --> 45:52.966
<i>...Big Ray's secret boom stick
beneath the bar.</i>

45:53.137 --> 45:55.119
<i>He wouldn't hesitate to blow me in two...</i>

45:55.272 --> 45:58.108
<i>...should I decide
to take this to the next level.</i>

45:58.275 --> 46:00.075
Yeah, we're cool.

46:01.979 --> 46:04.211
<i>Now, I normally wouldn't
take shit from anyone.</i>

46:04.381 --> 46:06.785
<i>But I can't risk being barred from the Oasis.</i>

46:06.951 --> 46:10.721
<i>In my line of work, that'd be tantamount
to a death sentence.</i>

46:10.888 --> 46:15.102
<i>And like Ray said, we go back a long way.</i>

46:16.794 --> 46:19.869
<i>When I was 15 years old, life was shit.</i>

46:20.030 --> 46:24.666
<i>I had the loneliest, most underpaid,
thankless job on the planet.</i>

46:24.835 --> 46:26.703
<i>The paperboy.</i>

46:41.619 --> 46:43.520
<i>People call it bullying.</i>

46:43.688 --> 46:47.150
<i>I call it getting the shit kicked out of you
by a gang of little wankers.</i>

46:47.324 --> 46:51.333
<i>Their leader, Romeo,
the biggest bully of them all.</i>

46:56.133 --> 46:58.081
- Give us a quid.
- I haven't got any money.

46:58.235 --> 46:59.614
Give us a quid!

46:59.770 --> 47:02.264
- Hurry up!
- Come on, Fallon.

47:11.281 --> 47:13.628
<i>These beatings turned
into a daily occurrence.</i>

47:13.784 --> 47:15.948
<i>I found myself running
the gauntlet of chavs...</i>

47:16.153 --> 47:18.351
<i>...instead of doing my paper round.</i>

47:44.314 --> 47:46.661
We're gonna get you, Fallon!

47:46.817 --> 47:48.617
I know where he's going. Hurry.

47:48.786 --> 47:49.811
Go, go, go.

47:51.055 --> 47:54.939
<i>Nothing like some premium
hedge-hopping to escape a beating.</i>

48:16.413 --> 48:18.760
<i>What was this guy doing?</i>

48:18.916 --> 48:23.289
<i>From his entrance strategy, I was
pretty sure he wasn't the gas man.</i>

48:40.137 --> 48:42.700
- Right, there he is.
- Oh, look who it is.

48:42.873 --> 48:44.855
Are you going to fucking run again?

48:45.009 --> 48:46.034
Come on.

48:46.644 --> 48:47.669
Come on!

48:47.878 --> 48:49.142
Come on!

48:58.388 --> 48:59.858
All right, mate?

49:07.998 --> 49:11.643
<i>Now, I don't know what I was thinking,
but I followed him.</i>

49:15.573 --> 49:16.985
<i>Who was this guy?</i>

49:17.141 --> 49:19.180
<i>Was he responsible for that explosion?</i>

49:19.343 --> 49:21.416
<i>For killing someone?</i>

49:22.512 --> 49:24.016
<i>I stalked him for weeks...</i>

49:24.181 --> 49:27.313
<i>...in which time,
he killed three more people.</i>

49:38.663 --> 49:42.581
<i>One day, I plucked up the courage
to knock on his door.</i>

49:52.743 --> 49:53.882
Excuse me, sir.

49:54.311 --> 49:57.261
I've seen what you do, and I need your help.

49:58.883 --> 50:00.420
Oh, no.

50:00.585 --> 50:01.883
This a windup, yeah?

50:03.086 --> 50:04.829
All right, then.

50:05.222 --> 50:07.261
What exactly you seen me do?

50:07.424 --> 50:11.365
Well, you kill people, don't you?

50:22.239 --> 50:25.280
"Mike Fallon."

50:25.442 --> 50:26.821
Who sent you?

50:26.977 --> 50:28.537
No one.

50:29.479 --> 50:31.154
"No one."

50:31.348 --> 50:33.057
Where'd you get this footage?

50:33.216 --> 50:35.779
I filmed it.
I've been following you for weeks.

50:36.286 --> 50:37.881
Following me?

50:38.255 --> 50:40.294
Weeks? Why?

50:41.291 --> 50:42.761
What is it that you want?

50:42.927 --> 50:44.795
I need your help. I'm getting the crap...

50:44.962 --> 50:47.605
...kicked out of me every day
by a gang of chavs.

50:47.765 --> 50:49.109
You kill people for a living.

50:49.266 --> 50:51.305
If anyone can help me, it's gotta be you.

50:51.468 --> 50:54.270
- Are you taking the piss?
- No, I'm not, sir.

50:54.438 --> 50:55.817
Sir.

50:55.973 --> 50:58.775
I think you're amazing. A genuine craftsman.

50:59.376 --> 51:02.019
Might wanna work on
your surveillance-detection skills.

51:03.180 --> 51:04.650
Does anyone know you're here?

51:04.815 --> 51:06.922
No. I swear.

51:07.084 --> 51:08.679
No one, you swear?

51:11.789 --> 51:14.705
You got a set of balls on you, don't you?

51:16.694 --> 51:18.254
Come here.

51:22.933 --> 51:25.849
I can't have people knowing
about my business, now, can I?

51:29.607 --> 51:31.315
Jesus!

51:32.209 --> 51:33.679
Come here!

51:36.346 --> 51:38.214
Stay there.

51:43.721 --> 51:45.520
If I'm not home by 6 p.m. tonight...

51:45.690 --> 51:47.672
...my foster parents will find
a copy of that footage...

51:47.825 --> 51:49.864
...with this address and a note
telling them to call the police...

51:50.027 --> 51:52.863
- ...because I've been murdered.
- Bollocks. You're bluffing.

51:53.030 --> 51:55.639
Maybe I am, but do you really
wanna take that chance?

52:00.671 --> 52:02.470
Resourceful little bastard, ain't you?

52:04.374 --> 52:06.937
And a fucking good kick. Come on, sit down.

52:10.815 --> 52:14.516
So let me get this straight.
You want me to teach you...

52:14.685 --> 52:16.553
...how to defend yourself
against these bullies?

52:16.721 --> 52:18.315
- No, sir.
- "Sir." See, I like that.

52:18.488 --> 52:22.589
- Shows respect. Brownie points there.
- I want you to teach me how to kill them.

52:23.160 --> 52:24.231
Kill them?

52:24.394 --> 52:27.003
- All of them?
- All of them.

52:27.531 --> 52:28.910
But Romeo first.

52:29.066 --> 52:32.164
- He's their leader.
- That's it. That's smart.

52:32.335 --> 52:36.515
You take out the boss first,
the minions just seem to flutter away.

52:39.409 --> 52:41.402
I suppose this is where I get to tell you...

52:41.579 --> 52:43.891
...that you remind me of me
when I was your age.

52:44.582 --> 52:45.755
But you don't.

52:45.916 --> 52:49.584
You're short, you're ugly
and you can't fight for shit.

52:52.356 --> 52:55.853
But there's something about you.
Don't know what it is.

52:59.764 --> 53:02.497
Fuck it. You got yourself a deal.

53:03.767 --> 53:05.361
Have a look at this.

53:05.535 --> 53:08.371
Do you know the meaning of "defenestration"?

53:08.939 --> 53:10.773
No.

53:12.242 --> 53:13.803
<i>Defenestration:</i>

53:14.011 --> 53:16.539
<i>The act of throwing someone out of a window.</i>

53:17.081 --> 53:18.756
It's that one up there.

53:18.916 --> 53:21.478
<i>Now, I couldn't believe
there was an actual word for it.</i>

53:21.652 --> 53:25.057
<i>Look it up in the Oxford English
Dictionary if you don't believe me.</i>

53:27.592 --> 53:29.631
Remember what I told you.

53:30.260 --> 53:32.424
Try and remember not to bottle it.

54:41.732 --> 54:44.682
<i>I knew that dirty little chav
would take the bait.</i>

54:44.835 --> 54:46.304
<i>It was now or never.</i>

55:00.217 --> 55:04.067
<i>They say the first kill's always
the hardest, emotionally.</i>

55:05.689 --> 55:07.431
<i>But the truth is...</i>

55:09.727 --> 55:12.039
<i>...I didn't really feel anything.</i>

55:21.005 --> 55:23.283
- How'd you get on?
- Defenestrated.

55:23.440 --> 55:27.905
Defenestrated. That's great.
But defenestration is the act of...

55:28.078 --> 55:31.894
...shoving somebody out a window,
not tipping them off a balcony.

55:32.049 --> 55:34.520
Didn't do your fucking homework, did you?

55:35.085 --> 55:37.067
You bring me back me tenner?

55:37.387 --> 55:39.016
Oh, dear.

55:39.422 --> 55:41.415
Don't worry. You can
bring me back 12 quid later...

55:41.592 --> 55:44.633
...or 15 quid tomorrow.
Do you get it? Do you understand?

55:44.795 --> 55:47.563
Good boy. Take a seat.

55:58.441 --> 56:01.574
What goes around comes around.

56:01.746 --> 56:04.126
You think about any funny business with me...

56:04.281 --> 56:08.701
...I'll make sure the right people get
those pics and I will fucking kill you.

56:10.721 --> 56:12.133
Got it?

56:12.590 --> 56:13.968
Good.

56:19.196 --> 56:21.394
What do you think about learning a trade?

56:21.566 --> 56:22.944
Becoming a hit man?

56:23.100 --> 56:25.298
No, none of that Yank bollocks.
We're British here.

56:26.804 --> 56:28.934
You see, what I am...

56:29.439 --> 56:31.432
...is an assassin.

56:32.643 --> 56:34.716
And I'm offering you an apprenticeship.

56:37.782 --> 56:40.219
Only if you think you're up for it.

56:42.252 --> 56:45.202
<i>Turns out I didn't wanna be
an astronaut after all.</i>

56:45.355 --> 56:47.132
Fuck, yeah.

56:48.492 --> 56:51.135
Look at this one...
Look at his supporters right there.

56:51.295 --> 56:54.758
He's gonna suffocate
in his own fucking underpants.

56:54.932 --> 56:57.096
<i>Over the next few years,
Big Ray taught me everything...</i>

56:57.267 --> 57:00.479
<i>...I needed to know about the dark arts
of his murder methods.</i>

57:00.638 --> 57:04.134
- Gets that anywhere near them...
- <i>Toxicology.</i>

57:04.308 --> 57:07.292
- Shine the light like that? Okay.
- Right in there.

57:12.315 --> 57:13.990
I'm only fucking kidding you, mate.

57:14.151 --> 57:16.463
<i>Long-range weapons, short-range weapons...</i>

57:16.621 --> 57:18.033
<i>...all sorts of weapons.</i>

57:18.188 --> 57:22.527
<i>Using an odorless accelerant
to catch out those careless smokers.</i>

57:23.060 --> 57:24.837
<i>And he trained me in martial arts...</i>

57:24.995 --> 57:28.457
<i>...taekwondo, karate,
kung fu, Eskrima, Muay Thai.</i>

57:28.633 --> 57:30.466
<i>You name it, we practiced it.</i>

58:07.437 --> 58:09.841
<i>Big Ray was tough on me,
yeah, that's for sure.</i>

58:10.207 --> 58:14.672
<i>But iron sharpens iron,
and now I'm as tough as nails.</i>

58:15.880 --> 58:19.194
Always remember the three golden rules:

58:19.349 --> 58:21.092
Never get angry...

58:21.251 --> 58:23.028
...never get involved...

58:23.186 --> 58:26.956
...most important of all, never get caught.

58:28.425 --> 58:30.738
<i>I've already broken two of them.</i>

58:31.696 --> 58:33.598
<i>And now I'm in danger of breaking a third.</i>

58:55.252 --> 58:57.656
- What do you want?
- We need to talk.

58:57.855 --> 58:59.757
I have nothing to say to you, so get lost.

58:59.923 --> 59:02.930
I need to know what Beth was
working on before she died, okay?

59:03.093 --> 59:04.927
We were working on our future together.

59:05.095 --> 59:06.565
- A future that didn't include you.
- I know.

59:06.731 --> 59:09.339
But what kind of environmental bollocks
was she working on?

59:09.499 --> 59:11.492
God, and you wonder why she left you.

59:12.002 --> 59:14.736
That environmental bollocks
was the most important thing...

59:14.905 --> 59:16.853
- ...in Beth's life.
- Till you came along?

59:17.007 --> 59:18.271
Fuck you.

59:20.611 --> 59:22.080
All right, I'm sorry, okay?

59:22.246 --> 59:24.650
Will you just let me in for one minute?

59:25.916 --> 59:27.260
Charlie.

59:27.417 --> 59:30.424
It's about Beth's death.
I think there's more to it...

59:30.588 --> 59:33.834
...than the police understand.
Just let me in, please.

59:36.459 --> 59:38.293
You got one minute.

59:46.269 --> 59:48.137
Your hair's different.

59:49.339 --> 59:52.141
Yeah. It changes with the weather.

59:52.309 --> 59:54.177
Maybe that's why Beth left me.
I've had the same hairstyle...

59:54.344 --> 59:57.682
- ...since I was 12.
- Oh, yeah, maybe that's it.

59:57.848 --> 01:00:00.160
Or the fact that you have a dick.

01:00:01.518 --> 01:00:03.717
So, what about Beth's death?

01:00:04.354 --> 01:00:06.029
All right, I'll get to the point.

01:00:06.857 --> 01:00:10.069
It wasn't just a burglary gone wrong.
She was taken out.

01:00:11.629 --> 01:00:13.303
What the hell does "taken out" mean?

01:00:13.931 --> 01:00:18.202
You know, professionally, she was taken out.

01:00:18.368 --> 01:00:20.350
What, like, you mean, the game show?

01:00:20.504 --> 01:00:21.883
No. She was assassinated.

01:00:22.039 --> 01:00:23.303
Why would you think that?

01:00:23.473 --> 01:00:25.034
I know about this sort of thing.

01:00:25.209 --> 01:00:27.077
Okay, if you know something
the rest of us don't...

01:00:27.244 --> 01:00:29.853
...maybe you should go to the police
and let them deal with it.

01:00:30.014 --> 01:00:31.814
The police won't do anything about it.

01:00:31.982 --> 01:00:36.230
- We're better off keeping them out of it.
- We? No, there is no we.

01:00:36.386 --> 01:00:38.015
Because according to Beth...

01:00:38.188 --> 01:00:42.072
...you're just some city boy
in the middle of a midlife crisis.

01:00:42.727 --> 01:00:44.709
She never knew what I actually did.

01:00:44.862 --> 01:00:46.536
Oh, okay. What is it you really do?

01:00:47.765 --> 01:00:49.895
I'm a loss adjuster.

01:00:50.267 --> 01:00:52.067
Great. Good for you.

01:00:52.236 --> 01:00:55.277
- Why do I care?
- I specialize in accidents, okay?

01:00:55.472 --> 01:00:57.671
So you have single-handedly
deduced that Beth...

01:00:57.842 --> 01:01:00.336
...was assassinated when all
of Scotland Yard thinks different.

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:02.253
- Pretty much.
- Get the fuck out.

01:01:02.412 --> 01:01:03.916
I don't give a shit
if you believe me or not...

01:01:04.081 --> 01:01:06.120
...but Beth was taken out by professionals.

01:01:06.283 --> 01:01:07.388
That is a fucking fact.

01:01:07.552 --> 01:01:08.930
She was probably sticking
her nose in somewhere...

01:01:09.086 --> 01:01:11.922
...it didn't belong again,
and this time, they've hit back.

01:01:12.089 --> 01:01:15.426
- You're serious about this.
- Like a midget in a nudist colony.

01:01:15.593 --> 01:01:17.723
Okay, now you're just freaking me out, Mike.

01:01:17.895 --> 01:01:21.745
Yeah, that's how I felt
when you told me Beth was pregnant.

01:01:21.899 --> 01:01:24.279
Okay, I'm sorry that you had
to find out that way...

01:01:24.434 --> 01:01:27.077
...but I didn't want you having anything
to do with our child.

01:01:27.237 --> 01:01:29.435
- It wasn't your child, was it?
- Okay, look...

01:01:29.607 --> 01:01:31.646
...you were a shit boyfriend,
and you would've been...

01:01:31.809 --> 01:01:33.483
- ...an even shittier father.
- How do you know?

01:01:33.644 --> 01:01:35.990
- Because you're a selfish asshole.
- Oh, here we go.

01:01:36.146 --> 01:01:39.096
You can't deal with the fact
that Beth left you for another woman...

01:01:39.249 --> 01:01:41.562
...because you're a homophobic prick.

01:01:41.719 --> 01:01:43.165
Hang on a minute. I haven't got a problem...

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:46.270
- ...with lesbians and gays.
- Well, lesbians are gays.

01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:49.971
Whatever. I haven't got
a problem with it, okay?

01:01:50.127 --> 01:01:52.656
- Then what is your problem?
- You wanna know?

01:01:52.830 --> 01:01:54.664
Yes, I wanna know what your problem is.

01:01:54.832 --> 01:01:58.169
All right. Beth's the only girl
I ever really cared about.

01:01:58.335 --> 01:02:02.401
Christ, she's the only girl
I never cheated on, for God's sakes.

01:02:02.573 --> 01:02:03.678
Good for you.

01:02:03.841 --> 01:02:06.757
Do you want a medal? Because
that's all she ever was to you...

01:02:06.911 --> 01:02:08.745
...was some trophy to add to your collection.

01:02:08.912 --> 01:02:11.987
Oh, like you can talk. You're no better
than me, you home-wrecker.

01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:15.159
Get out.

01:02:15.986 --> 01:02:17.455
That was a pretty good punch.

01:02:17.622 --> 01:02:19.455
I said, get out.

01:02:54.124 --> 01:02:56.322
Cliff, what the fuck?!

01:03:39.637 --> 01:03:41.915
Jesus Christ, Cliff.
Who sent you to take me out?

01:03:42.072 --> 01:03:44.236
- Was it Milton?
- Mike?

01:03:44.909 --> 01:03:46.686
Is that you?

01:03:48.078 --> 01:03:50.880
- Hello, mate.
- Yeah, it's me, you crazy bastard.

01:03:51.048 --> 01:03:52.723
You almost took my fucking head off.

01:03:52.883 --> 01:03:54.147
Sorry about that, mate.

01:03:55.352 --> 01:03:57.300
You know how it is.

01:03:57.788 --> 01:03:59.895
Once I've flipped that switch...

01:04:00.357 --> 01:04:01.804
Who sent you to take me out?

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:04.858
I didn't even know you was here, mate.

01:04:06.964 --> 01:04:08.593
Cliff.

01:04:09.667 --> 01:04:12.548
Cliff. Cliff, you fucking crazy bastard.

01:04:19.176 --> 01:04:21.044
Who is that?

01:04:22.279 --> 01:04:23.954
A friend from the office.

01:04:24.314 --> 01:04:25.613
Another loss adjuster?

01:04:26.884 --> 01:04:28.057
Yeah, kind of.

01:04:29.419 --> 01:04:31.732
He's an assassin, all right? Like me.

01:04:32.189 --> 01:04:33.602
What is going on?

01:04:34.391 --> 01:04:35.986
Mike, what the hell is going on?

01:04:36.193 --> 01:04:38.574
I fucking kill people for a living,
all right?

01:04:38.729 --> 01:04:41.109
It's not glamorous, it doesn't go
down well at cocktail parties...

01:04:41.265 --> 01:04:42.894
...but I like the hours,
and it pays the bills.

01:04:43.067 --> 01:04:45.106
You listen to me. I need to know what Beth...

01:04:45.269 --> 01:04:47.980
...got herself into, and I need to know now.

01:04:48.973 --> 01:04:50.112
Charlie, look at me.

01:04:50.274 --> 01:04:52.506
Whatever Beth knew,
they think you know as well.

01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:55.956
You understand me?
This guy came here for you, not me.

01:04:56.914 --> 01:04:58.326
Okay.

01:05:00.117 --> 01:05:03.192
She was looking into this...
This oil company...

01:05:03.353 --> 01:05:05.996
...where they wanted to drill
in the North Sea.

01:05:06.624 --> 01:05:07.649
Go on.

01:05:07.825 --> 01:05:09.089
I don't know anything else.

01:05:09.259 --> 01:05:11.754
And I...

01:05:12.262 --> 01:05:14.426
God, her parents. Beth always used to...

01:05:14.599 --> 01:05:16.797
...back up her computer
on her dad's hard drive.

01:05:16.967 --> 01:05:18.596
There's gotta be some information there.

01:05:18.769 --> 01:05:22.140
All right, good, good. Okay,
you get a taxi to Beth's parents.

01:05:22.306 --> 01:05:26.190
You stay there. If you hear anything,
you let me know, okay?

01:05:27.945 --> 01:05:30.291
I can't believe this is happening.

01:05:30.748 --> 01:05:32.217
Yeah, me neither.

01:05:32.382 --> 01:05:35.879
I just killed one of my mates.
How the bloody hell do I make this...

01:05:36.053 --> 01:05:38.855
- ...look like an accident?
- What?

01:05:39.023 --> 01:05:41.005
Never mind. Go on. Get out of here.

01:05:41.158 --> 01:05:44.404
Charlie, don't talk to the police.

01:05:49.133 --> 01:05:51.035
Screw it.

01:05:54.538 --> 01:05:55.985
Sorry, mate.

01:06:19.897 --> 01:06:21.525
This is private club.

01:06:21.699 --> 01:06:24.170
- What do you want?
- It's all right. He's with us.

01:06:30.407 --> 01:06:32.207
Not your usual hangout, is it, Fred?

01:06:32.376 --> 01:06:34.757
There's a lot
you don't know about me, Mike...

01:06:34.912 --> 01:06:36.449
...my friend with the bike.

01:06:37.314 --> 01:06:39.512
- Where is he?
- Who?

01:06:39.683 --> 01:06:41.756
Don't make me do something I'll regret, Fred.

01:06:43.888 --> 01:06:45.266
You want me to get rid of him?

01:06:45.689 --> 01:06:46.714
Yeah, I think so.

01:06:49.894 --> 01:06:51.033
He's in the back.

01:06:53.731 --> 01:06:58.879
Oh, yeah. I tell you, my job is so stressful.

01:06:59.036 --> 01:07:00.482
The people I have to work with.

01:07:05.209 --> 01:07:06.952
You've been ducking me, Milton.

01:07:07.111 --> 01:07:08.649
See, that's the thing about
imported Russian muscle.

01:07:08.846 --> 01:07:10.919
If you wanna knock them out,
you gotta hit them fucking hard.

01:07:11.281 --> 01:07:13.058
Preferably with something metal and heavy.

01:07:13.216 --> 01:07:15.323
Mike, you don't wanna do this.

01:07:15.485 --> 01:07:17.285
- You know the rules.
- Rules?

01:07:17.454 --> 01:07:19.733
- Yeah.
- No, no, no.

01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:22.270
You don't get to talk to me about rules.

01:07:22.426 --> 01:07:24.226
Anyway, don't know what you're talking about.

01:07:24.394 --> 01:07:27.162
Haven't laid a finger on you. Yet.

01:07:27.364 --> 01:07:29.471
You're jeopardizing your own position.

01:07:29.634 --> 01:07:31.616
Don't be a fool.

01:07:32.169 --> 01:07:35.335
Oh, dear.
I've only gone and done it, haven't I?

01:07:35.505 --> 01:07:39.321
You know what? It was a mistake,
and no one has to know.

01:07:39.476 --> 01:07:41.880
Just between you and me. Just...

01:07:42.379 --> 01:07:45.592
- Jesus Christ, Mikey, stop it!
- Now, I can live with the fact...

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:48.757
...that you still haven't paid me
for two jobs.

01:07:48.919 --> 01:07:50.365
I can even live with the fact you sent me...

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:53.801
...on some bullshit money drop turned
into my own assassination attempt.

01:07:54.424 --> 01:07:56.805
But the fact that you knew
a hit had been put out...

01:07:56.961 --> 01:08:00.423
...on my Beth and went ahead
without consulting me first...

01:08:00.931 --> 01:08:02.674
Oh, Milton.

01:08:02.833 --> 01:08:04.610
I'm fucking struggling with that one.

01:08:04.769 --> 01:08:07.536
Look, these claims, they're preposterous.

01:08:07.705 --> 01:08:11.315
I mean, I had no idea
that the drop was rigged.

01:08:11.475 --> 01:08:14.357
- It was a legitimate request.
- Oh, just a coincidence, was it?

01:08:14.511 --> 01:08:17.346
Since when have you ever sent
one of us to pick up the money?

01:08:17.514 --> 01:08:20.727
- It was a fucking setup.
- Oh, poppycock!

01:08:50.147 --> 01:08:52.185
What happened? Where am I?

01:08:52.349 --> 01:08:54.091
Oh, Jesus. It's you.

01:08:54.251 --> 01:08:57.691
Why don't you just tell me
what you actually want?

01:08:57.854 --> 01:08:59.233
I wanna know who paid
for the hit on my Beth...

01:08:59.389 --> 01:09:01.861
...and why you took
the fucking job in the first place.

01:09:02.026 --> 01:09:05.272
If I had to discuss every job
that came across my desk...

01:09:05.462 --> 01:09:08.344
...with the hired help,
do you think we'd actually...

01:09:08.497 --> 01:09:11.265
...get around to killing anyone?
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:09:11.468 --> 01:09:13.781
Ever heard of the term "bastinado," Milton?

01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:14.996
What?

01:09:15.171 --> 01:09:19.180
It's a type of torture, derived
from the Italian noun <i>bastonata.</i>

01:09:19.343 --> 01:09:21.837
It means to stroke,
with the use of a stick...

01:09:22.011 --> 01:09:24.176
...usually the soles of the victim's feet.

01:09:27.517 --> 01:09:29.898
- Who's the client?
- I can't really say.

01:09:32.756 --> 01:09:35.741
The next one'll break bone and
you'll never walk the same again.

01:09:35.893 --> 01:09:38.238
The one after that, you'll probably
not be able to walk at all.

01:09:38.395 --> 01:09:40.296
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

01:09:40.497 --> 01:09:42.399
It was another accountant.

01:09:42.567 --> 01:09:45.037
He was a... He was a city boy.
You know the type.

01:09:45.202 --> 01:09:46.546
His name?

01:09:46.703 --> 01:09:48.116
I don't know.

01:09:50.741 --> 01:09:53.383
It was... It was Kent.

01:09:53.542 --> 01:09:55.104
Leonard Kent.

01:09:55.279 --> 01:09:57.318
- Who does he work for?
- I don't know.

01:09:57.514 --> 01:09:59.075
I swear, I really don't know.

01:09:59.249 --> 01:10:01.231
We used encrypted e-mails.

01:10:01.385 --> 01:10:03.732
Are you holding out on me, Milton?

01:10:04.455 --> 01:10:06.984
No, no. No, I swear I'm not.

01:10:07.157 --> 01:10:10.232
In the immortal words
of the late Winston Churchill...

01:10:10.394 --> 01:10:14.494
...this is a riddle wrapped in
a mystery inside of an enigma.

01:10:14.666 --> 01:10:17.274
Well, riddle me this, then, you little twat.

01:10:17.434 --> 01:10:20.749
How important is it to you
to be able to walk again?

01:10:21.572 --> 01:10:24.579
Well, then... Well, then go
and do it. All right?

01:10:24.742 --> 01:10:27.270
But you will never work in this city again.

01:10:27.444 --> 01:10:30.428
Big Ray will hunt you down,
and he will kill you...

01:10:36.453 --> 01:10:38.196
Fuck it.

01:11:03.113 --> 01:11:04.457
What you done, Mike?

01:11:04.615 --> 01:11:06.608
Nothing for you to worry about, Fred.

01:11:06.784 --> 01:11:09.552
I've been on the phone to Ray.
He wants you to come with me.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:12.396
Oh, what you gonna do?
Cut me and stick a plaster on it?

01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:13.661
If I have to.

01:11:13.825 --> 01:11:17.709
- We both know that won't happen, Fred.
- This is tried and tested.

01:11:18.495 --> 01:11:21.297
Tell you what. You like a gamble, don't you?

01:11:21.465 --> 01:11:23.744
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:11:23.901 --> 01:11:25.803
I'll flick to a page in your phone book.

01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:28.886
If the name in the top left-hand corner
has five or more letters...

01:11:29.039 --> 01:11:31.716
...you can take me to Big Ray.
If it has less than five...

01:11:32.176 --> 01:11:33.349
...you let me go.

01:11:35.245 --> 01:11:37.238
As long as you don't tell him.

01:11:38.548 --> 01:11:40.143
All right.

01:11:48.392 --> 01:11:50.351
Night-night, Fred.

01:11:53.197 --> 01:11:55.065
- Hello?
- <i>Mike, it's Charlie.</i>

01:11:55.232 --> 01:11:56.496
<i>I've got Beth's hard drive.</i>

01:11:56.667 --> 01:11:59.070
<i>It's loaded with stuff.
You really need to see this.</i>

01:11:59.236 --> 01:12:01.366
- Where are you?
- <i>I just left Beth's parents.</i>

01:12:01.538 --> 01:12:04.545
<i>Can you meet me at the bus stop
at the entrance at Wanstead Park?</i>

01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:06.611
All right. I'll be there.

01:12:06.778 --> 01:12:10.547
I don't give a shit. This firm's on
its last legs because of you.

01:12:10.715 --> 01:12:12.389
It was a high-six-figure deal, Ray.

01:12:12.549 --> 01:12:14.748
I had no idea they would change the terms.

01:12:14.919 --> 01:12:17.197
You do not get to make decisions
without talking to me first.

01:12:17.354 --> 01:12:18.801
Do you understand that?!

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.694
Look at the state of you two.
You can take down legions...

01:12:25.863 --> 01:12:28.938
...of Iraqi soldiers
and fucking Taliban ragheads.

01:12:29.099 --> 01:12:31.206
But one bloke
from the wrong side of the river...

01:12:31.368 --> 01:12:33.532
...gives you a right royal dusting.

01:12:33.705 --> 01:12:35.983
What kind of Special Forces are you?

01:12:36.173 --> 01:12:37.711
Well, you trained him, Ray.

01:12:40.311 --> 01:12:41.610
True.

01:12:41.779 --> 01:12:43.909
Look, Fallon's gone berserk.

01:12:44.081 --> 01:12:46.758
He's a loose cannon,
and he needs to be shackled.

01:12:46.918 --> 01:12:48.296
Shut it!

01:12:48.452 --> 01:12:52.097
You've run off your mouth far too much today.

01:12:53.558 --> 01:12:54.936
Right.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.760
We've just had word.

01:12:57.928 --> 01:13:01.596
Now, the police have recovered Cliff's body.

01:13:01.766 --> 01:13:04.112
Impaled on his own ax.

01:13:07.104 --> 01:13:08.699
I...

01:13:09.106 --> 01:13:11.270
...think it's clear to all of us
who's to blame.

01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:14.456
All drink to Cliff.

01:13:21.018 --> 01:13:25.323
I have made
a very difficult decision tonight.

01:13:26.356 --> 01:13:28.156
You all have a new mark.

01:13:31.162 --> 01:13:32.335
Mike Fallon.

01:13:33.463 --> 01:13:34.967
He's crossed too many lines.

01:13:35.465 --> 01:13:39.680
He's proven to be catastrophic for business.

01:13:39.837 --> 01:13:42.878
But more than that,
he's gone and killed one of us.

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.749
One of you.

01:13:45.175 --> 01:13:47.521
So you'll be doing this one for free.

01:13:48.779 --> 01:13:51.182
- Do we have to?
- Yes, you fucking have to!

01:13:51.348 --> 01:13:53.216
Will you be joining us, boss?

01:13:53.384 --> 01:13:56.220
Don't be stupid. I ain't killed anybody
since the Olympics...

01:13:56.386 --> 01:13:59.393
...but if any of you fuckers let me down...

01:13:59.757 --> 01:14:02.319
...I might have to rethink my retirement.

01:14:02.492 --> 01:14:05.328
- So it'll be just us five.
- Fuck me, it speaks.

01:14:05.963 --> 01:14:07.865
Actually, it'll be the four of you.

01:14:08.032 --> 01:14:10.014
Jane, I need you to go to Twickenham...

01:14:10.167 --> 01:14:12.844
No, that's bullshit. I want in on Fallon...

01:14:14.271 --> 01:14:17.039
You do as you're told.

01:14:17.775 --> 01:14:22.046
The safety of the client is your priority.

01:14:24.014 --> 01:14:25.575
- What?
- He said:

01:14:25.783 --> 01:14:27.822
"Is there a kill brief on him, boss?"

01:14:31.221 --> 01:14:34.171
No, mate, there is not
a fucking kill brief on him.

01:14:34.559 --> 01:14:36.552
But if you need one...

01:14:36.728 --> 01:14:40.578
...it's Fallon. Go fucking kill him.
End of brief.

01:14:42.532 --> 01:14:44.936
Write it down if you need to.

01:14:45.936 --> 01:14:48.943
If he gets to the client,
this firm is fucked.

01:14:49.106 --> 01:14:50.701
We are all fucked.

01:14:51.676 --> 01:14:55.172
So we end this
before he can do any more damage.

01:14:56.446 --> 01:14:58.394
Understood?

01:15:00.885 --> 01:15:02.753
I suppose so.

01:15:32.349 --> 01:15:34.662
I haven't been on a bus since I was about 16.

01:15:42.426 --> 01:15:43.623
So, what did you find out?

01:15:43.794 --> 01:15:47.006
Well, Beth was investigating
this Indian energy company.

01:15:47.164 --> 01:15:48.337
Pancock Petroleum.

01:15:48.498 --> 01:15:51.266
Ever since the BP disaster
in the Gulf of Mexico...

01:15:51.435 --> 01:15:54.169
...oil companies haven't been in favor
by many governments.

01:15:54.371 --> 01:15:55.841
Hang on. Since when did the government...

01:15:56.006 --> 01:15:58.352
...care more about the environment
than making millions?

01:15:58.509 --> 01:16:00.742
Since an environmentalist
became prime minister.

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:06.119
I take it that current events
are not the top of your reading list.

01:16:06.283 --> 01:16:07.912
Not really, no.

01:16:08.252 --> 01:16:10.781
Okay, well, anyways,
in the last six months...

01:16:10.955 --> 01:16:12.299
...something changed.

01:16:12.456 --> 01:16:14.689
Out of nowhere,
Pancock got drilling rights...

01:16:14.892 --> 01:16:16.520
...to the coast outside of Northumberland.

01:16:16.694 --> 01:16:19.302
Beth got all this information
from an inside source.

01:16:19.463 --> 01:16:21.024
This accountant named Archie Rudd.

01:16:21.498 --> 01:16:24.711
Rudd was feeding her all kinds
of information, including e-mails...

01:16:24.902 --> 01:16:28.273
...from the corporation to the
prime minister himself, threatening him.

01:16:28.438 --> 01:16:30.671
Right before they were
gonna go public with it...

01:16:31.642 --> 01:16:35.822
- ...Archie just stopped responding to her.
- Still waiting for the money on that one.

01:16:37.314 --> 01:16:39.991
<i>Archie Rudd. My double-price incentive.</i>

01:16:41.285 --> 01:16:42.310
<i>Wait, that was you?</i>

01:16:42.953 --> 01:16:43.978
No.

01:16:44.154 --> 01:16:46.626
Okay, well, seems like he has
a partner in the firm.

01:16:46.791 --> 01:16:49.673
- Leonard Kent.
- Yeah, how do you know that?

01:16:51.729 --> 01:16:53.175
I have my ways.

01:16:53.998 --> 01:16:55.171
Okay, well...

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.743
...it's all here.

01:17:01.338 --> 01:17:03.240
This is good work, Charlie.

01:17:07.544 --> 01:17:08.923
So, what are you gonna do?

01:17:09.079 --> 01:17:11.722
Looks like I'm gonna pay
Leonard Kent a little visit.

01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:15.156
You're gonna find out who killed Beth, right?

01:17:15.686 --> 01:17:17.030
Oh, yeah.

01:17:19.323 --> 01:17:22.661
You know, I can't remember Beth
ever saying one good thing about you.

01:17:23.961 --> 01:17:26.489
She loved you and she cared about you...

01:17:26.664 --> 01:17:29.397
...and you were too self-absorbed
to even notice.

01:17:30.701 --> 01:17:34.551
But she was still so happy to have
your baby growing inside of her.

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:38.551
I mean, she adored every second of it.

01:17:40.244 --> 01:17:42.476
I'm sorry that I took that from you.

01:17:45.382 --> 01:17:48.913
Now, you go out there,
and you find out who did this to Beth.

01:17:49.086 --> 01:17:51.216
And you make them fucking pay.

01:17:55.225 --> 01:17:57.389
Look after yourself, Charlie.

01:18:06.503 --> 01:18:08.702
<i>What are you doing, you people?</i>

01:18:08.873 --> 01:18:10.741
No, no. You don't understand.

01:18:10.908 --> 01:18:15.760
We have an arrangement
that you have failed to realize.

01:18:15.913 --> 01:18:20.332
And we do not pay
for any of the work to date...

01:18:20.517 --> 01:18:23.126
...until this thing with the girl is...

01:18:23.287 --> 01:18:25.269
Is sorted out.

01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:28.592
Am I absolutely clear?

01:18:28.759 --> 01:18:30.593
Well, good.

01:18:43.608 --> 01:18:44.804
Who are you?

01:18:45.409 --> 01:18:47.813
- What do you want?
- I want a few simple answers...

01:18:47.978 --> 01:18:50.655
...to some very straightforward questions.

01:18:50.815 --> 01:18:53.981
Who ordered the assassination
of Beth Carpenter?

01:18:55.286 --> 01:18:57.667
I've no idea what you're talking about.

01:18:58.322 --> 01:19:00.122
You ever heard of defenestration, mate?

01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:02.785
Yes. Defenestration is the act
of throwing something...

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:04.953
...or somebody out of a window.

01:19:05.129 --> 01:19:07.624
Aren't we the smarty-pants, Leonard?

01:19:08.165 --> 01:19:09.429
How did you know my name?

01:19:09.601 --> 01:19:11.594
I know a lot about you, Leonard Kent.

01:19:11.769 --> 01:19:15.015
Husband to Lauren.
Father to little Elle and little Joseph.

01:19:15.172 --> 01:19:17.667
Corporation accounts specialist.

01:19:22.146 --> 01:19:23.707
Who ordered the hit, Lenny?

01:19:24.816 --> 01:19:26.980
I can't tell you that.

01:19:27.151 --> 01:19:29.019
- They'll kill me.
- What do you think plummeting...

01:19:29.186 --> 01:19:31.715
...four floors down
to the pavement's gonna do?

01:19:32.890 --> 01:19:35.692
Well, it's only four floors.
No guarantee that'll kill me.

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:38.628
Yeah, well, I can guarantee this.
It's gonna fucking hurt.

01:19:38.796 --> 01:19:42.406
I'm sure the old "crooked, suicidal
accountant takes a swan dive" act...

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:44.467
...will be enough to explain
that bruise on your face.

01:19:44.636 --> 01:19:46.629
What bruise on my face?

01:19:46.804 --> 01:19:48.911
- Ready for your flight, Mr. Kent?
- No!

01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:51.644
Zim. Zim! Zim!

01:19:51.809 --> 01:19:54.041
Atal Zim. He's a senior executive at the...

01:19:54.211 --> 01:19:56.649
At the Pancock Corporation!
I'll tell you everything!

01:19:56.814 --> 01:19:59.012
No, no, no!

01:20:04.055 --> 01:20:05.080
Talk.

01:20:05.255 --> 01:20:07.750
You're gonna kill me
whether I talk or not, aren't you?

01:20:07.925 --> 01:20:11.661
After the week I've had,
I'm not even sure about that anymore.

01:20:11.829 --> 01:20:13.822
Call it a crisis of conscience if you like.

01:20:13.998 --> 01:20:16.948
Why don't you start fucking talking,
and I'll keep you posted...

01:20:17.134 --> 01:20:19.241
...on how the self-reflection thing
plays out?

01:20:19.403 --> 01:20:20.748
Okay.

01:20:20.905 --> 01:20:21.930
Okay.

01:20:22.874 --> 01:20:25.516
Zim's here, currently. He's in London.

01:20:25.676 --> 01:20:27.578
He's in Twickenham.

01:20:28.412 --> 01:20:32.444
His father,
one of the wealthiest men in Asia...

01:20:32.650 --> 01:20:35.725
...is also the chief shareholder
of the corporation.

01:20:36.587 --> 01:20:40.767
But Zim Junior stands to inherit
the whole company...

01:20:40.925 --> 01:20:44.741
...when the old man passes on,
which will be in...

01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:46.368
Well, any day.

01:20:46.764 --> 01:20:48.962
- Inoperable brain tumor.
- Very touching.

01:20:49.166 --> 01:20:50.237
Yeah.

01:20:50.401 --> 01:20:52.930
- Tell me about Archie Rudd.
- Archie...

01:20:53.103 --> 01:20:56.680
Oh, my loose-lipped
"Save the Whale" former partner.

01:20:57.742 --> 01:21:02.651
He was slipping information
to a politically active outsider.

01:21:02.814 --> 01:21:04.442
Beth Carpenter.

01:21:04.882 --> 01:21:08.458
Cared more about saving the world
than he did about making money.

01:21:08.619 --> 01:21:11.090
It's not very good for an accountant, is it?

01:21:12.256 --> 01:21:15.388
Zim had me contact someone...

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.502
...to shut him up.

01:21:18.228 --> 01:21:21.440
Beth Carpenter, well, we thought
we'd just put the frighteners on her.

01:21:21.599 --> 01:21:23.592
She was a cunning little fox.

01:21:23.768 --> 01:21:25.602
She contacted Zim...

01:21:25.770 --> 01:21:28.754
...and the members of Parliament...

01:21:28.906 --> 01:21:31.138
...and threatened to expose the whole bribes.

01:21:32.342 --> 01:21:34.814
You don't blackmail these people.

01:21:34.979 --> 01:21:36.847
She gave us no choice, really.

01:21:37.014 --> 01:21:39.998
We even put a hit out on a contractor.

01:21:40.151 --> 01:21:41.655
Just to tidy up all the ends.

01:21:41.819 --> 01:21:45.224
- Yeah, it didn't go to plan, did it, Lenny?
- No, it didn't...

01:21:46.523 --> 01:21:47.629
How do you know that?

01:21:47.792 --> 01:21:50.502
It was me, dummy.

01:21:50.662 --> 01:21:52.826
Not as smart as you think you are, are you?

01:21:54.465 --> 01:21:55.696
Charlie Adams, why her?

01:21:55.866 --> 01:21:59.362
Because her involvement with Beth.
We didn't know what she knew.

01:21:59.536 --> 01:22:01.610
- What about the other assassins?
- What other assassins?

01:22:01.772 --> 01:22:05.781
- The men hired to take out Beth.
- There are no other assassins!

01:22:06.343 --> 01:22:08.382
It was a specific in the contract.

01:22:08.545 --> 01:22:10.447
One person carried out all the hits.

01:22:11.148 --> 01:22:12.709
Who organized the hits?

01:22:12.883 --> 01:22:15.115
Well, he didn't give me his name.

01:22:15.285 --> 01:22:17.187
Some American prick.

01:22:17.354 --> 01:22:20.669
Sounded like he was auditioning
for a knighthood.

01:22:21.325 --> 01:22:22.954
But...

01:22:28.966 --> 01:22:32.975
...I recorded all the conversations,
just for insurance.

01:22:36.206 --> 01:22:39.156
Now, you're not going to kill me.

01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:40.415
Are you?

01:22:41.779 --> 01:22:43.977
Give me the fucking thing.

01:23:00.731 --> 01:23:04.068
It's payback time, Fallon.
Don't make this harder than it has to be.

01:23:04.569 --> 01:23:07.279
Hey, Mac. You're not so homophobic now...

01:23:07.437 --> 01:23:10.319
- ...with your jaw wired shut, are you?
- Fuck you.

01:23:11.508 --> 01:23:14.549
- He said, "Fuck you!"
- Yeah, fuck you.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.748
Grenade that motherfucker.

01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:30.865
Fuck!

01:23:45.943 --> 01:23:48.654
Mick, you fucking prick.

01:24:07.898 --> 01:24:10.278
You made me kill my friend, motherfucker.

01:24:10.434 --> 01:24:11.904
That's your motherfucking ass!

01:24:53.543 --> 01:24:55.013
Jesus.

01:24:57.848 --> 01:25:00.855
Jesus Christ, Pete.
You dirty, little rat fuck.

01:25:01.018 --> 01:25:02.521
What was that? Chloroform?

01:25:02.687 --> 01:25:05.397
Good job, I can hold my breath
like a deep-throating whore.

01:25:05.557 --> 01:25:07.664
You're my dream assignment, Fallon.

01:25:07.825 --> 01:25:09.989
Let's be having you.

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:11.721
Come on, then.

01:25:21.806 --> 01:25:24.368
Never did like
that greasy, little twat anyway.

01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:32.051
You fucking little runt.

01:25:33.150 --> 01:25:35.530
Oh, for fuck sakes, Fred!

01:25:35.687 --> 01:25:37.999
I'm very sorry it's come to this, Mike.

01:25:38.155 --> 01:25:40.764
- To what?!
- I'm here to kill you.

01:25:41.325 --> 01:25:43.489
- What, with your little bag of tricks?
- I know.

01:25:43.661 --> 01:25:46.371
But what am I supposed to do?
I'm a finesse killer.

01:25:46.530 --> 01:25:50.266
- Fuck.
- This fighting game, it's not my style.

01:25:50.467 --> 01:25:53.235
Look. I've got a little bit
of an idea, all right?

01:25:53.404 --> 01:25:54.999
I'm open to suggestions.

01:26:12.923 --> 01:26:15.360
Never know. Might come in handy.

01:26:25.302 --> 01:26:26.441
<i>Try them again.</i>

01:26:27.004 --> 01:26:29.384
There's no point.
They'll call when they're done.

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:31.944
- Call them.
- Reception is always terrible...

01:26:32.109 --> 01:26:35.879
...down by the river.
I'm sure that everything is fine.

01:26:36.046 --> 01:26:39.258
Your assurances don't mean shit
to me right now, Milton.

01:26:40.384 --> 01:26:41.979
Call Jane.

01:26:42.153 --> 01:26:45.559
Make sure everything's
locked up tight down her end.

01:27:18.756 --> 01:27:22.161
<i>I've been assured that this mess
will be resolved this evening.</i>

01:27:22.627 --> 01:27:26.693
But just in case
your firm fails me yet again...

01:27:26.864 --> 01:27:28.538
...do we have enough men?

01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:31.707
We have more than enough men, Mr. Zim.

01:27:32.136 --> 01:27:33.548
You don't need to worry.

01:27:33.704 --> 01:27:36.312
I'll gauge whether I need to worry or not.

01:27:36.473 --> 01:27:40.084
Forgive me if my confidence in you
and your colleagues has waned.

01:27:47.484 --> 01:27:49.079
I told you we needed more men.

01:27:51.589 --> 01:27:56.531
Mr. Zim, one woman is all you need
to put an end to this.

01:27:59.797 --> 01:28:02.143
It's been a long time coming, Michael.

01:28:02.299 --> 01:28:04.008
Funny, I was thinking the same thing.

01:28:04.368 --> 01:28:08.013
But in my head, it was gonna be me
on your back instead of that katana.

01:28:09.173 --> 01:28:11.371
Lock yourself in the other room.

01:28:11.541 --> 01:28:13.649
This won't take long.

01:28:16.313 --> 01:28:18.386
You know we don't have to do this, Jane.

01:28:18.548 --> 01:28:19.927
Oh, yes, we do, Michael.

01:28:20.918 --> 01:28:22.262
Let's see what you've got.

01:29:59.116 --> 01:30:00.586
Bitch!

01:30:00.752 --> 01:30:02.289
Fucking...

01:30:36.353 --> 01:30:38.666
It's time to butter the toast, Michael.

01:30:38.823 --> 01:30:41.773
And if you're lucky,
I'll let you lick the knife.

01:30:59.076 --> 01:31:01.753
You always thought
I was flirting with you, didn't you?

01:31:01.912 --> 01:31:04.076
Yeah, pretty sure you wanted to fuck me.

01:31:05.482 --> 01:31:06.929
I did.

01:31:07.852 --> 01:31:11.018
I always wanted to fucking kill you.

01:31:20.798 --> 01:31:24.010
Just so you know,
I begged Milton to let me go...

01:31:24.168 --> 01:31:27.334
...and kill that bitch
of an ex-girlfriend of yours.

01:31:40.551 --> 01:31:42.384
Still reckon you wanted to fuck me.

01:31:57.735 --> 01:31:59.238
You know who I am, Mr. Zim?

01:32:01.071 --> 01:32:03.714
I'm the bloke your guy hires
to remedy those problems...

01:32:03.874 --> 01:32:05.856
...only money can fix.

01:32:09.146 --> 01:32:10.559
You know the type, right?

01:32:10.715 --> 01:32:12.389
Need someone to disappear.

01:32:12.549 --> 01:32:15.625
No police interference.
I'm the man for the job.

01:32:16.153 --> 01:32:18.146
Make it look like an ordinary accident.

01:32:18.355 --> 01:32:20.759
No trail, no fuss.

01:32:21.158 --> 01:32:22.992
No questions asked.

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:25.564
I have money. Millions.

01:32:25.730 --> 01:32:27.472
Name your price.

01:32:29.499 --> 01:32:32.233
How long would it take
to scrape together 100 million quid?

01:32:32.770 --> 01:32:34.273
Give me 24 hours.

01:32:34.438 --> 01:32:36.386
Yeah? Too long.

01:32:37.575 --> 01:32:38.748
See, you fucked up, Zim.

01:32:39.476 --> 01:32:41.584
Not only did you try
to have me snuffed out...

01:32:41.746 --> 01:32:44.092
...after performing
an exemplary job for you...

01:32:44.248 --> 01:32:45.478
...at the highest level...

01:32:45.650 --> 01:32:48.326
...you gave the order to have
my pregnant ex-girlfriend...

01:32:48.485 --> 01:32:51.128
...Beth Carpenter, murdered.

01:32:51.822 --> 01:32:53.382
What you got to say for yourself?

01:32:53.824 --> 01:32:55.863
My deepest condolences.

01:32:56.027 --> 01:32:58.020
It was just business, I can assure you.

01:32:59.764 --> 01:33:03.340
See, I had a rather innovative piece
of theatrics conjured up for you.

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:07.715
But the more I think about it,
and knowing what you did to my Beth...

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:11.277
...you don't fucking deserve it.

01:33:12.643 --> 01:33:16.344
- I'm gonna straight-up murder you.
- No, wait. Wait! Wait!

01:33:17.815 --> 01:33:20.491
I've been given the green light
for new drilling rights...

01:33:20.651 --> 01:33:22.929
...worth a billion pounds sterling.

01:33:23.721 --> 01:33:26.283
I'll happily cut you in.

01:33:26.456 --> 01:33:30.921
You'll be rich beyond your wildest dreams.

01:33:37.501 --> 01:33:38.573
No, thanks.

01:33:44.041 --> 01:33:46.341
Bad for the environment.

01:33:46.977 --> 01:33:49.255
<i>Don't worry, our lads are the best.</i>

01:33:49.446 --> 01:33:50.745
<i>Fuck you.</i>

01:33:50.948 --> 01:33:55.162
<i>You're only calm because you cower
behind me all your miserable little life.</i>

01:33:55.319 --> 01:33:57.096
Erroneous, Ray.

01:33:57.254 --> 01:33:58.393
Erroneous.

01:33:58.556 --> 01:34:00.595
I am never wrong, Milton.

01:34:01.392 --> 01:34:03.557
And don't you be bringing Latin into my pub.

01:34:03.728 --> 01:34:06.678
We speak the Queen's English here.
All right, you cunt?!

01:34:08.265 --> 01:34:09.826
Mind your language, Ray.

01:34:15.239 --> 01:34:18.519
Oh, I'd stay away from the boom stick
beneath the bar for now.

01:34:20.411 --> 01:34:22.040
I'm pretty quick with this.

01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:25.855
Well, look at us.

01:34:26.016 --> 01:34:29.455
As the saying goes...

01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:34.084
...if a man's home is his castle,
then his pub is the battlements.

01:34:36.594 --> 01:34:38.006
What?

01:34:38.395 --> 01:34:39.626
No drink?

01:34:40.130 --> 01:34:43.228
Well, I think we're past that by now,
don't you?

01:34:44.301 --> 01:34:46.614
Ray, why don't...
Why don't you call the team...

01:34:47.271 --> 01:34:50.734
- ...and get them back here?
- The team are no longer available.

01:34:51.609 --> 01:34:53.442
What have you done?

01:34:53.611 --> 01:34:55.023
Fred will be fine.

01:34:55.412 --> 01:34:58.544
Mac was a case of friendly fire.
Mick will have to live with that.

01:34:58.716 --> 01:35:00.128
Pete's dead.

01:35:00.284 --> 01:35:02.563
I fucking hated him anyway.

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.590
As for Cliff...

01:35:07.424 --> 01:35:09.019
Yeah, that was unfortunate.

01:35:10.094 --> 01:35:11.472
Jane?

01:35:19.336 --> 01:35:20.897
It's not all her blood.

01:35:21.072 --> 01:35:23.908
Well, then whose is the rest?

01:35:24.074 --> 01:35:25.486
Some bloke named Atal Zim.

01:35:27.077 --> 01:35:28.523
Your client.

01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:31.356
You fucking idiot.

01:35:31.548 --> 01:35:33.588
Do you realize what you've gone and done?

01:35:33.751 --> 01:35:34.981
Milton set us up, Ray.

01:35:35.152 --> 01:35:37.191
He hired some rookie assassin to take me out.

01:35:37.354 --> 01:35:39.587
That is absolute poppycock.

01:35:39.757 --> 01:35:43.823
Ray, I'm insulted
that you would even humor him on this.

01:35:43.994 --> 01:35:45.292
I am a professional, and I...

01:35:45.462 --> 01:35:47.775
<i>...triple the price of all jobs
if we can ensure...</i>

01:35:47.932 --> 01:35:49.469
<i>...that the trail is wiped clean.</i>

01:35:49.634 --> 01:35:52.367
<i>We need your man disposed of
following the jobs...</i>

01:35:52.570 --> 01:35:54.130
<i>...or I'm afraid we'll have to go elsewhere.</i>

01:35:54.305 --> 01:35:55.980
<i>No problem whatsoever.</i>

01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:59.272
<i>Hey, throw in a ticket or two
to the opera and you have a deal.</i>

01:35:59.443 --> 01:36:02.656
<i>And I've got just the man for the job.</i>

01:36:12.523 --> 01:36:14.904
Fucker. Dirty, little fuck.

01:36:24.334 --> 01:36:27.409
- I tried to tell you from the start, Ray.
- Hold on. Hold on.

01:36:27.605 --> 01:36:29.735
Let me get me breath back.

01:36:30.507 --> 01:36:31.738
Fucking hell.

01:36:32.176 --> 01:36:35.251
Thought you might break
two of the rules for a minute there.

01:36:38.415 --> 01:36:39.976
Fuck.

01:36:45.356 --> 01:36:47.133
I'm sorry.

01:36:47.658 --> 01:36:50.493
It was... It was greed.

01:36:50.661 --> 01:36:53.542
Good old-fashioned greed. Honest to God.

01:36:54.431 --> 01:36:58.201
Mikey, I regretted it
the moment that I did it.

01:36:58.369 --> 01:36:59.907
But they would've pulled the job.

01:37:00.071 --> 01:37:03.739
And it... It was a fortune for all of us.

01:37:05.509 --> 01:37:09.359
Well, guess we all make mistakes, don't we?

01:37:10.915 --> 01:37:12.213
Here you go, mate.

01:37:12.717 --> 01:37:13.742
Oh, Mikey.

01:37:14.284 --> 01:37:15.663
Oh, you're a darling.

01:37:16.687 --> 01:37:18.726
That's so sweet of you.

01:37:21.893 --> 01:37:24.091
You told them there was only one hit man
because you needed me...

01:37:24.261 --> 01:37:25.890
...to take out the accountant, didn't you?

01:37:26.063 --> 01:37:28.136
Because you knew
I would've never took out Beth.

01:37:28.299 --> 01:37:30.292
That's why you let them think
I took out all the marks.

01:37:30.467 --> 01:37:32.062
Easier to clean.

01:37:32.236 --> 01:37:33.865
I'm sorry. I really am.

01:37:34.939 --> 01:37:38.378
- Is this... Is this right, Ray?
- Hold on, Milton.

01:37:38.542 --> 01:37:39.955
- Thank you.
- There it is.

01:37:40.110 --> 01:37:41.614
Thank you.

01:37:41.779 --> 01:37:43.818
Earl Grey, is it, Milton?

01:37:44.882 --> 01:37:46.385
Yes.

01:37:47.451 --> 01:37:50.253
Nothing but the best, old bean.

01:38:16.914 --> 01:38:18.589
Well, fuck me.

01:38:19.283 --> 01:38:21.447
Looks like I owe Fred 100 notes.

01:38:22.086 --> 01:38:23.111
Looks like you do.

01:38:23.754 --> 01:38:25.952
Who the fuck do you think you are?!

01:38:26.123 --> 01:38:27.957
I spent a lifetime
getting this firm to the top...

01:38:28.125 --> 01:38:31.496
...and you flush it down the pan
without a second's thought.

01:38:32.163 --> 01:38:36.195
Bet you think you're Mr. Clever.
Mr. Wise, Mr. Intelligent.

01:38:36.366 --> 01:38:40.182
I should slay you where you sit
right now for what you've done.

01:38:42.673 --> 01:38:44.871
Yeah, but you won't, will you, Ray?

01:38:46.010 --> 01:38:48.812
Oh, don't you be so smug.

01:38:52.850 --> 01:38:55.492
Oh, well, all right.

01:38:56.386 --> 01:38:59.302
I brought you up as my own son.

01:38:59.456 --> 01:39:01.564
Well, what do you think this is?

01:39:01.759 --> 01:39:04.037
Fucking <i>Waltons?</i>

01:39:04.195 --> 01:39:05.300
We're killers.

01:39:05.462 --> 01:39:08.139
This is the only way
tonight could have played out.

01:39:09.066 --> 01:39:12.403
All this because of a fucking bird.

01:39:13.003 --> 01:39:14.985
I knew you'd gone soft.

01:39:15.139 --> 01:39:18.510
- Yeah, maybe I have.
- Oh, too fucking right you have.

01:39:21.411 --> 01:39:24.908
You know, maybe you're not cut out
for this business anymore.

01:39:37.928 --> 01:39:39.158
We're done.

01:39:51.208 --> 01:39:52.883
I'm sorry, Ray.

01:39:53.044 --> 01:39:54.582
Yeah, well...

01:39:57.014 --> 01:39:58.814
...it's a bit late for sorry.

01:40:02.219 --> 01:40:04.896
Now, if you don't mind...

01:40:06.423 --> 01:40:09.225
...get the fuck out of my pub.

01:40:14.331 --> 01:40:16.564
And watch your back, Mike.

01:40:20.838 --> 01:40:22.740
Always do, Ray.

01:40:33.884 --> 01:40:36.959
<i>Maybe Ray's right. Maybe I have gone soft.</i>

01:40:37.121 --> 01:40:39.616
<i>Couple of days ago,
there wasn't a doubt in my mind...</i>

01:40:39.791 --> 01:40:43.230
<i>...that I was carved out to end lives,
not to start them.</i>

01:40:44.062 --> 01:40:47.137
<i>But all this business
with Beth and the baby...</i>

01:40:47.598 --> 01:40:50.730
<i>...well, maybe I need
to reassess my priorities.</i>

01:40:51.302 --> 01:40:55.642
<i>I could put this killing life behind me
if only I had a nice pension plan.</i>

01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:00.621
<i>But let's face it, this game
is the only one I know how to play.</i>

01:41:00.778 --> 01:41:03.158
<i>It's a safe bet that
every city needs someone like me...</i>

01:41:03.313 --> 01:41:05.113
<i>...keeping order from the shadows.</i>

01:41:09.186 --> 01:41:11.658
<i>But had my unborn baby
got the chance to know me...</i>

01:41:12.389 --> 01:41:15.305
<i>...would he or she have
been proud of the old man?</i>

01:41:15.826 --> 01:41:17.808
<i>No, probably not.</i>

01:41:18.596 --> 01:41:22.206
<i>But my advice to him or her,
and to all of you out there, is simple.</i>

01:41:23.267 --> 01:41:27.003
<i>Never forget your past, don't worry
too much about your present...</i>

01:41:27.171 --> 01:41:30.782
<i>...and live life like there's no tomorrow.
Because you never know.</i>

01:41:30.942 --> 01:41:33.413
<i>An accident might be just around the corner.</i>
