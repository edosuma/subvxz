00:05.100 --> 00:12.500
Two men, young, idealistic. The fine product
of a generation hardened by world war.

00:12.500 --> 00:16.100
Two fathers whose paths would
converge in a new battle.

00:16.100 --> 00:20.900
An invisible war between a silent
enemy and a sleeping giant...

00:20.900 --> 00:24.800
...on a scale to dwarf
all historical conflicts.

00:24.800 --> 00:30.300
A 50-years war, its killing fields lying in
wait for the inevitable global holocaust.

00:30.300 --> 00:34.400
Theirs was the dawn of Armageddon.

00:34.400 --> 00:38.500
And while the world was unaware, unwitting
spectators to the hurly-burly of the...

00:38.500 --> 00:44.600
...decades-long struggle between heaven and
earth there were those who prepared for the end.

00:44.600 --> 00:48.600
Who measured the size and power of
the enemy, and faced the choices:

00:48.600 --> 00:54.000
Stand and fight, or bow to
the will of a fearsome enemy.

00:54.500 --> 01:01.000
Or to surrender; to yield and collaborate.
To save themselves and stay their enemy's hand.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.900
Men who believed that victory
was the absence of defeat...

01:03.900 --> 01:09.900
...and survival the ultimate ideology.
No matter what the sacrifice.

02:05.100 --> 02:08.500
- Shoot me now, before it's too late!
- Mulder?!

02:08.500 --> 02:09.400
Shoot!

02:10.900 --> 02:12.900
Who are you!

02:14.200 --> 02:15.800
Get down!

02:15.800 --> 02:17.700
- Who are you?!
- Get down!

02:17.700 --> 02:21.700
Down! Down!
On the floor!

02:36.100 --> 02:38.000
Who are you?!

02:38.000 --> 02:42.500
We're with the Centers for Disease Control.
Remain calm and where you are for your own good.

02:42.500 --> 02:46.000
You're gonna be transported to a quarantine
facility as soon as we can secure the environment.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
- Quarantine for what?
- A contagion.

02:52.500 --> 02:56.000
A contagion of unknown origin.

03:49.900 --> 03:53.800
There must be some kind of mistake.
I signed up for the aromatherapy treatment.

03:53.800 --> 03:58.800
Are we going to be able to talk to somebody
who can tell us what this is all about?

04:10.100 --> 04:12.500
Where the hell do you think we are?

04:12.500 --> 04:16.700
I think, based on our travel
time probably Fort Marlene.

04:16.700 --> 04:19.899
High risk decontamination and quarantine.

04:25.900 --> 04:31.300
I'm going to beg for your understanding and forgiveness and
offer my humblest apologies for the way this went down.

04:31.300 --> 04:35.600
I didn't have a lot of choices.
I owe your neighbors apologies as well.

04:35.600 --> 04:41.100
It's going to be some time before they get back in the building.
We're still acting on a CDC Level-Four quarantine protocol.

04:41.100 --> 04:44.800
- Based on what information?
- That Cassandra Spender had contracted a highly...

04:44.800 --> 04:50.200
...contagious vectoring organism which produces
a spontaneous cellular breakdown and combustion.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.000
What?

04:51.000 --> 04:56.300
She was and remains the only surviving victim of an
unspecified medical experiment that killed...

04:56.300 --> 05:00.200
...seven doctors with violent
and unexplained burning.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.900
- Who called you?
- Agent Spender.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.300
- Where's Cassandra?
- She's isolated...

05:06.300 --> 05:09.200
Pending full and satisfactory
medical evaluation.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.800
Cassandra Spender was in a general
hospital environment for days.

05:12.800 --> 05:16.200
We met with her, and yet on a
whim you call in the third battalion.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.400
It's unjustified and highly
suspicious as to motive.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.500
- Scully...
- What motives are you suspecting?

05:22.500 --> 05:26.000
- Your isolation of Cassandra.
- She's Patient Zero.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.800
No one is sick or infected here.

05:28.800 --> 05:35.000
I mean, I assume that based on you
walking in here dressed to the nines
offering apologies masquerading as explanations.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.800
- Scully...
- Mulder, I want to see Cassandra.

05:37.800 --> 05:41.800
- I told you -- she's isolated.
- Yes, and I am a medical doctor.

05:41.800 --> 05:47.000
Who is suspended indefinitely
from her position at the FBI.

06:04.600 --> 06:09.000
- They've burned our clothes.
- Hey... I heard gray is the new black.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.400
Mulder, this stinks, and not just
because I think that woman is a...

06:15.600 --> 06:20.700
- Well, I think you know what I think that woman is.
- No. Actually, you hide your feelings very well.

06:20.700 --> 06:24.000
Agent Spender calling the
Centers for Disease Control?

06:24.000 --> 06:27.900
Mulder, this is just somebody using their
position to stage a hi-tech government kidnapping.

06:27.900 --> 06:29.900
Apparently not.
I just spoke to AD Skinner.

06:29.900 --> 06:35.700
He was at the hospital when Cassandra went missing.
He heard Spender make the phone call to the CDC.

06:35.700 --> 06:38.500
But she wasn't sick, Mulder.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.300
I mean, the remarkable thing is she was well.

06:41.300 --> 06:44.300
Well, then why did she come to
my apartment demanding to be killed?

06:44.300 --> 06:50.200
Because of everything that had been done to her.
Because of the tests, because of the medical
experiments and the implant put in her neck.

06:50.200 --> 06:53.600
The same thing that was done to me.
She just wants it to stop.

06:53.600 --> 06:57.800
And I'm telling you, they have
taken her so that it can continue.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.900
No. It won't continue.
It doesn't have to anymore.

07:00.900 --> 07:04.000
She knows what she is, Scully. That's why
it's so dangerous for her to be alive.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.900
That's why she came to my
apartment asking to be killed.

07:07.900 --> 07:10.500
What is she?

07:10.700 --> 07:13.900
I think she's the one, Scully.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.800
I recovered all the medical
records form the hospital.

07:18.800 --> 07:22.000
The doctors who examined her before she escaped...

07:22.000 --> 07:29.700
...are telling us Cassandra Spender may be the
culmination of 25 years of this group's finest efforts.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.600
That's why the rebels struck.
They were trying to kill her.

07:32.600 --> 07:37.400
They killed everyone but her. They struck
to keep her alive; keep us from killing her.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.800
- What do the rebels want?
- To destroy us.

07:40.800 --> 07:45.900
They know that when the aliens learn of
Cassandra, colonization will begin.

07:45.900 --> 07:51.800
- We must destroy Cassandra.
- No. Let colonization begin.

07:51.800 --> 07:56.300
We must turn over Cassandra.
Save ourselves.

07:56.300 --> 08:01.000
Bill Mulder was against this.
He said this would be our tragic mistake.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.200
Bill Mulder sacrificed his only daughter
because he knew this day would arrive.

08:06.200 --> 08:11.900
What choice have we... if you want
to see your families survive?

08:11.900 --> 08:17.000
If we want to see those we
sacrificed returned to us?

08:21.600 --> 08:23.800
Hello?

08:24.500 --> 08:27.100
Hello?

08:27.600 --> 08:31.600
Oh, oh, Ma'am. These shoes?
They're... they're two sizes too small.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.600
I was wondering if I could get a...

08:35.100 --> 08:38.100
A pair that fit, maybe?

09:14.800 --> 09:18.200
I can't be seen with you.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.100
Marita?

09:22.900 --> 09:26.800
If they catch me with you,
they'll kill me this time.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.100
Who?

09:29.400 --> 09:35.400
- The Smoking Man and... his group.
- What have they done to you?

09:35.600 --> 09:38.700
Tests.

09:38.700 --> 09:41.400
Terrible, terrible tests.

09:41.400 --> 09:45.500
- Like the tests on Cassandra Spender?
- No.

09:45.500 --> 09:50.600
No, Cassandra Spender is part of a
program that's been going on for 25 years.

09:50.600 --> 09:54.300
A hybrid program.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.800
Then what were the tests on you?

09:56.800 --> 10:02.000
I was infected with the alien
virus -- the black oil.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.200
My tests were on the vaccine against
it... being developed in secret.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.900
In secret from the alien colonists.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.400
The hybrid program was in
cooperation with the aliens...

10:12.400 --> 10:17.600
...but the conspirators never intended
to succeed... to finish the work.

10:17.600 --> 10:22.200
- They were buying time.
- To make a vaccine and build a weapon.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.900
But Cassandra Spender happened.

10:24.900 --> 10:29.700
She's the first, isn't she?
She's the first successful alien/human hybrid.

10:29.700 --> 10:36.400
If she is... and the aliens
learn a hybrid exists...

10:36.400 --> 10:40.400
...colonization of the planet will begin.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.700
With no stopping it.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.500
Jeffrey.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.000
Jeffrey.

10:58.300 --> 11:02.500
- Jeffrey.
- Mom... How are you feeling?

11:02.500 --> 11:07.800
- Uh, fine. Why are they keeping me here?
- I'm keeping you here because you're safe here.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.600
- Safe from who?
- You know who. From my father.

11:10.600 --> 11:16.400
- You can't keep me safe from him.
- I can, Mom and I'm going to.
There won't be any more tests on you.

11:16.400 --> 11:21.300
You don't understand.
You don't understand about me.

11:21.300 --> 11:26.900
- I do. I understand everything now.
- You don't understand what will happen...

11:26.900 --> 11:30.400
...what will happen to you
if they find me out.

11:30.400 --> 11:34.000
- You've got to let me go.
- They'll just hurt you again, Mom.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.500
Yes. You must let them.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.300
Or everyone dies.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.700
Everyone.

11:42.900 --> 11:45.800
Jeffrey...

11:46.700 --> 11:50.300
Please... Jeffrey...

11:51.500 --> 11:55.200
Jeffrey! Jeffrey...

12:17.000 --> 12:20.700
- The latest in home security.
- Hey, you get through this, you got to come through me.

12:20.700 --> 12:24.100
I got a call from Scully.
Said it was urgent.

12:26.100 --> 12:29.600
I'll ask you to hear me out
before you launch any objection.

12:29.600 --> 12:34.100
Mulder, I asked them to pull up
everything they could on Diana Fowley.

12:34.100 --> 12:37.100
- I don't have time for this.
- Mulder, she's playing you for a fool.

12:37.100 --> 12:41.500
- I know her, Scully. You don't.
- You knew her. You don't anymore.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.900
I think we can prove that to you.

12:43.900 --> 12:49.200
She took a position in the FBI's
foreign counter-terrorism unit in 1991.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.000
Seven years in Europe.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.200
Yet there isn't a single piece of information
available on her activities in the FBI files.

12:58.100 --> 13:01.600
I hope you've got something more
than that to indict her with.

13:01.600 --> 13:06.900
Travel records pulled from airline manifests
that had been purged from her FBI records.

13:06.900 --> 13:14.200
Extensive movement throughout Western Europe.
Almost weekly trips to and from Tunisia.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.100
- For the purpose of what?
- That's what we couldn't figure...

13:17.100 --> 13:21.500
- ...until we took a flyer and we found this.
- Mutual UFO network logs.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.400
MUFON.

13:22.400 --> 13:30.900
Special Agent Diana Fowley of the FBI was visiting every
European chapter collecting data on female abductees.

13:30.900 --> 13:34.200
- So she's collecting data. Big deal.
- Or hiding it.

13:34.200 --> 13:38.700
- Scully, you're reaching.
- Mulder, when I was abducted a chip was put in my neck.

13:38.700 --> 13:43.200
When I happened upon a MUFON group filled
with women who'd had the same experience.

13:43.200 --> 13:48.100
So you're suggesting that Diana is monitoring
these abductees? Monitoring these tests?

13:48.100 --> 13:52.800
You tell me that Cassandra Spender
is the critical test subject, ...

13:52.800 --> 13:56.800
...the one who could prove everything.
And yet, who is watching over her?

13:56.800 --> 14:00.700
Mulder, I can prove what you're
saying or I can disprove it...

14:00.700 --> 14:04.600
...but not when Diana Fowley is
keeping us from even seeing her.

14:04.600 --> 14:11.200
Mulder, ask yourself why there is no information
whatsoever on Special Agent Diana Fowley.

14:11.200 --> 14:16.200
Why she would suddenly happen into your life
when you are closer than ever to the truth.

14:16.200 --> 14:21.900
I mean, you ... you ask me to trust no one
and yet you trust her on simple faith.

14:21.900 --> 14:26.700
Because you've given me no
reason here to do otherwise.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.900
Well, then I can't help you anymore.

14:31.900 --> 14:35.400
- Scully, you're making this personal.
- Because it is personal, Mulder.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.200
Because, without the FBI, personal
interest is all that I have.

14:39.200 --> 14:44.500
And if you take that away then
there is no reason for me to continue.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Diana?

15:11.700 --> 15:13.700
Diana?

16:13.300 --> 16:17.500
Sorry.
Nobody home.

16:18.900 --> 16:22.100
What are you doing here?

16:22.600 --> 16:25.600
The door was open. I came in.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.900
Interesting company you keep.

16:27.900 --> 16:33.000
No more interesting than your
apparent... ah... lingerie fetish.

16:38.100 --> 16:41.000
You feeling smug, C.G.B.?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.700
Yeah, I know your name.

16:43.700 --> 16:46.900
I know your game and I got nothing to lose.

16:46.900 --> 16:50.800
I remember looking over a gun
barrel at you once before, Agent Mulder.

16:50.800 --> 16:55.700
You couldn't pull the trigger then.
What makes you think you can do it now?

16:56.500 --> 16:59.300
I came here looking for my son.

16:59.300 --> 17:02.900
- Why?
- Because he's betrayed me.

17:02.900 --> 17:07.200
He's chosen the wrong side.
He's chosen to believe in your cause.

17:07.200 --> 17:11.900
- That presumes my cause is wrong.
- Oh, it is, Agent Mulder. It is.

17:11.900 --> 17:16.500
I'm not the one using innocent
people, innocent women, ...

17:16.500 --> 17:22.700
...as lab rats, trying to create a hybrid, an alien/human
hybrid, so that I might save my own sorry ass...

17:22.700 --> 17:25.500
...when they finally come knocking!
You find that funny?!

17:25.500 --> 17:30.800
Your father was against it, too,
back in '73. The lone dissenter.

17:30.800 --> 17:34.600
But he came to his senses.
And gave up your sister, Samantha.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.600
He didn't give up my sister.
He was forced to. You made him do it.

17:37.600 --> 17:42.400
Oh, you're wrong, Agent Mulder.
I can't tell you how wrong you are.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.200
How wrong you've always been.

17:46.700 --> 17:50.200
We had agreed to cooperate
with the alien colonists.

17:50.200 --> 17:54.700
By a majority vote taken by the group
that your father and I worked for.

17:54.700 --> 18:01.000
A group that came together at the State Department
on a project dating back to 1947, to Roswell.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
The vote changed that, though.
It changed everything.

18:05.000 --> 18:11.800
We no longer cleaved to any government agency.
We would now operate privately, on our own project.

18:11.800 --> 18:18.000
That was your father's objection: that we would
ally ourselves with the alien colonists.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.300
- Towards your own selfish end.
- We forestalled an alien invasion.

18:22.300 --> 18:26.300
- No, no, no, you only managed to postpone it.
- We saved billions of lives.

18:26.300 --> 18:30.100
You put those lives on hold
so you alone could survive!

18:30.100 --> 18:33.700
No, Agent Mulder, so you could.

18:33.700 --> 18:38.100
That's exactly what your father failed to realize.

18:38.100 --> 18:44.000
He railed at us and our plans
even as the process had begun.

18:44.500 --> 18:52.000
While the group had agreed
to the most painful sacrifices.

18:52.500 --> 18:57.900
Sacrifices that... no one else
would ever be asked to make.

18:57.900 --> 19:01.500
You gave them your children!

19:01.500 --> 19:04.200
You gave them your wife!

19:04.900 --> 19:10.300
You sent them away... like they were things.

19:10.300 --> 19:14.100
We sent them away, Agent Mulder,
because it was the right thing to do.

19:14.100 --> 19:20.700
- You sent them away to be tested on.
- We sent them so they would come back to us. Don't you see?

19:22.100 --> 19:27.200
You can't think these
choices were made lightly.

19:27.200 --> 19:31.900
They were the most painful
decisions of our lives.

19:31.900 --> 19:37.000
Watching our families' faces...

19:45.300 --> 19:48.500
You're a liar.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.800
My sister wasn't taken from any hangar. She was
abducted from our home right in front of me.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.700
Because your father was
late to understand the necessity.

19:58.700 --> 20:02.900
That he, too, must give up one of
his children to the alien colonists.

20:02.900 --> 20:10.400
The aliens insisted on it. It was the only way
they would give us the one thing that we needed.

20:10.400 --> 20:14.900
The one thing without which
we could not proceed.

20:15.100 --> 20:20.400
You see, the alien fetus would
give us the alien genome...

20:20.400 --> 20:25.600
The DNA with which we could
make a human hybrid.

20:25.600 --> 20:33.500
A new race, Agent Mulder. An alien/human
hybrid who could survive the holocaust.

20:33.500 --> 20:40.200
So you could survive.
And live to see your sister.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.400
And now you've succeeded?

21:00.700 --> 21:05.500
Quite... in spite of ourselves.

21:05.500 --> 21:10.500
The plan was to stall, to resist.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.200
- To work secretly on a vaccine.
- That was your father's idea.

21:16.200 --> 21:23.700
To use the alien DNA to make a vaccine.
To save everyone. The world.

21:23.700 --> 21:29.000
It was the reason he came along.
But it's too late now.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.500
Colonization is going to begin.

21:33.700 --> 21:37.700
There will be a sequence of events.

21:37.700 --> 21:45.100
A state of emergency will be declared because of a
massive outbreak of the alien virus delivered by bees.

21:45.100 --> 21:49.000
And the takeover will begin.

21:49.300 --> 21:55.200
- I have only to hand over Cassandra.
- You can't do that.

21:55.200 --> 22:01.000
Our hand's been forced by the
faceless rebels. We've no choice.

22:03.600 --> 22:09.500
- Stop it now or... I will stop it.
- No, Agent Mulder. You won't stop it.

22:09.500 --> 22:17.300
- Not if you want to see your sister again.
- You stop it... or everyone dies.

22:17.300 --> 22:18.900
No.

22:20.100 --> 22:24.900
I live. You live...

22:24.900 --> 22:29.200
To see your sister return.
It's what your father realized.

22:29.200 --> 22:33.400
It's what you'll realize as your father's son.

22:36.800 --> 22:42.100
Or die in vain with the rest of the world.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.800
Save her.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.800
Save yourself.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.700
You're looking for your father.

23:35.300 --> 23:40.100
- He's gone. They've all gone.
- But they're coming back.

23:40.100 --> 23:44.500
No. No, they left for good.

23:44.500 --> 23:46.400
What do you mean?

23:46.400 --> 23:49.300
- Well, they've abandoned these offices.
- But they've been here for 50 years.

23:49.300 --> 23:52.100
- I don't think you understand.
- Where did they go?

23:52.100 --> 23:54.000
To West Virginia.

23:54.000 --> 24:00.700
They'll be transported by the colonists and begin
medical preparations to receive the hybrid genes.

24:00.700 --> 24:04.200
Except for your father.

24:05.200 --> 24:08.500
- He's gone to get your mother.
- No one can get to her. I've got her secured away.

24:08.500 --> 24:14.000
Secured away? He's already had
his doctors looking at her.

24:14.000 --> 24:20.000
- I've got her under guard.
- She's probably being prepared as we speak, Jeffrey.

24:28.700 --> 24:32.100
- What do you want now?
- Just lie back, Cassandra. We're just going to remove...

24:32.100 --> 24:34.300
You leave me alone.
Leave me alone!

24:34.300 --> 24:37.100
Cassandra. Lie back.
Relax. It'll be easier.

24:37.700 --> 24:39.600
Leave me alone!

24:39.600 --> 24:43.000
Oh, no, you're not going to dope me!
No, don't dope me!

24:43.000 --> 24:45.200
Roll her over, please. Roll over.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.500
Don't!

24:49.200 --> 24:53.600
Damn you! Bastards!

25:05.100 --> 25:09.700
The biggest bastard of all.

25:09.700 --> 25:12.100
I need a few minutes.

25:24.800 --> 25:28.100
They never question it, do they?

25:28.100 --> 25:33.500
- What?
- Your power and authority...

25:33.500 --> 25:38.300
When you're really such a coward.

25:38.300 --> 25:44.300
I... I came in hopes that we might...

25:44.300 --> 25:50.000
...speak of the future... not the past.

25:50.000 --> 25:57.200
I'm at a disadvantage... since
you've stolen the past from me.

25:57.200 --> 26:01.400
I won't defend myself.

26:01.400 --> 26:06.400
Except... except to say that...

26:06.400 --> 26:10.700
We're here now only
because of what I've done.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.900
It's due to it.

26:13.900 --> 26:18.800
I know it now. Only now.

26:18.800 --> 26:24.100
But for so many years, I didn't understand, ...

26:24.100 --> 26:31.200
...through all the abductions
and the tests, that it was you.

26:32.900 --> 26:35.500
I ordered them, yes.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.900
But it was never my intention to harm you.

26:38.900 --> 26:43.400
- God.
- It was to save you.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.900
And Jeffrey.

26:46.700 --> 26:50.600
You can never save our son.

26:51.400 --> 26:54.700
He knows what you've done to me.

26:54.700 --> 26:58.000
I saved you.

26:59.200 --> 27:05.700
There's only one way... to save him.

27:05.700 --> 27:10.200
Only one thing you must do.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.500
I can't do it to you. I can't.

27:15.500 --> 27:20.100
I must die or they all die.

27:20.100 --> 27:21.800
No!

27:22.400 --> 27:23.700
No!

27:32.800 --> 27:36.800
- Geez.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

27:36.800 --> 27:43.000
- Fox, what are you doing?
- Nothing. Not a damn thing.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.500
- I came here looking for evidence.
- What are you talking about?

27:51.500 --> 27:56.600
Evidence that you'd lied to me; that you had
loyalties other than to me or to the X-Files.

27:56.600 --> 28:01.200
Nothing could be further from
the truth, Fox. Nothing.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.600
I didn't find anything, Diana.

28:07.100 --> 28:10.700
- But something found me.
- What?

28:10.700 --> 28:14.600
Fate. Destiny.
Whatever it's called when you...

28:14.600 --> 28:20.000
When you realize the choices you thought
you had in life were already made.

28:22.900 --> 28:24.700
Fox, what happened here?

28:24.700 --> 28:28.900
You were being paid a visit by
young Jeffrey Spender's father.

28:28.900 --> 28:31.300
The Cigarette-Smoking Man came
looking for his son...

28:31.300 --> 28:37.300
...who has now taken up the futile cause
that used to be mine; against his father.

28:37.300 --> 28:40.600
- Why futile?
- Because there's nothing to be done.

28:40.600 --> 28:45.100
And at some point, you just
have to accept that...

28:45.100 --> 28:52.200
...the only way those you love
are going to survive is if you give up.

29:01.200 --> 29:04.800
EL RICO AIR FORCE BASE.
That's where it all begins.

29:04.800 --> 29:10.000
That's where we need to
be if we want to survive it.

29:56.300 --> 29:59.200
Please help me.

30:00.800 --> 30:04.000
They're going to leave me here.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.200
Please stay away from me.
I can't help you.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.900
They're packing everything up.

30:07.900 --> 30:11.200
They aren't coming back here.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.800
I know you.

30:14.800 --> 30:18.500
- I can help you.
- You can't help me.

30:18.500 --> 30:22.100
I know where they're taking her.

30:24.400 --> 30:28.900
I know how they're taking her.

30:29.300 --> 30:33.700
You've got to trust me, Jeffrey.

31:23.400 --> 31:26.900
Shut the door. This is
a highly sensitive area.

31:26.900 --> 31:32.000
Go back. You're at a high risk
of contamination. Leave the room.

32:00.800 --> 32:02.400
Hey, Scully. It's me.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.700
Mulder, I was just dialing you.
Where are you?

32:04.700 --> 32:08.500
- I'm with Diana.
- I'm coming to get you.

32:08.500 --> 32:11.000
No. We're coming to get you.
You're coming with us.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.200
No, Mulder, listen to me.
I'm going to take you to Cassandra.

32:14.200 --> 32:18.900
- Cassandra's gone, Scully.
- I know, but I know where she's gone to, Mulder.

32:18.900 --> 32:24.400
- Scully, it's no use.
- Mulder, I'm going there whether you're coming or not.

32:25.700 --> 32:28.500
- Going where?
- To the Potomac yards.

32:28.500 --> 32:32.600
- They're transporting her by train car.
- Who gave you this information?

32:32.600 --> 32:36.200
- Agent Spender called me.
- All right.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.500
- I'm going to send you on ahead.
- What is it? What did she say?

32:38.500 --> 32:41.800
This may be our last chance to stop them.

33:07.300 --> 33:10.200
Turn around.
Turn around, Scully.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.900
What the hell is that?

34:36.500 --> 34:39.000
This is him.

34:46.800 --> 34:50.600
- You gonna tell me what the hell is going on?
- Our lives are in danger. We don't have much time.

34:50.600 --> 34:54.400
- Why couldn't you tell me that over the phone?
- If somebody overheard us, it might create mass panic.

34:54.400 --> 34:58.000
- Mass panic over what?
- El Rico Air Base.

35:53.400 --> 35:58.200
- We waited to send our communication.
- We were worried something had happened.

35:58.200 --> 36:01.500
- Shots were fired at us.
- By who?

36:01.500 --> 36:03.900
I don't know.

36:08.500 --> 36:12.200
We have people missing.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.500
Where's Alex Krycek?

37:11.800 --> 37:14.000
Krycek!

37:17.200 --> 37:19.700
- I'm trying to get out of here.
- What are you talking about?

37:19.700 --> 37:25.000
We can't get past security. They won't
recognize my authority to remove a patient.

37:34.400 --> 37:37.300
My father did this to her.
She wants to tell her story.

37:37.300 --> 37:41.500
You sorry son of a bitch.
You don't get it, do you?

37:41.500 --> 37:44.800
It's all going to hell.

37:45.300 --> 37:48.800
The rebels are going to win.

37:49.700 --> 37:51.800
They took it.

37:51.800 --> 37:54.500
They took what?

38:39.400 --> 38:43.000
- Who sent the communications?
- No one.

38:48.100 --> 38:51.500
This isn't supposed to be.

39:07.700 --> 39:12.400
- What is this?
- Get back. Back! Back! Back! Back!

40:08.900 --> 40:13.400
The way these people died...

40:13.400 --> 40:19.700
The loss of life here.
It is beyond words.

40:22.300 --> 40:27.800
I can't imagine how it must be
for you; losing your mother.

40:27.800 --> 40:33.000
Yes, sir. But that's not why
I asked for this meeting.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.700
Why did you ask for it?

40:34.700 --> 40:40.400
Because I'm responsible for the deaths of those
people at the Air Base hangar in no small way.

40:40.400 --> 40:43.200
I certainly didn't prevent them.

40:43.200 --> 40:50.300
I can assume then you can explain how they died?
Because I have yet to hear any explanation.

40:50.300 --> 40:55.400
Agent Mulder can explain it.
I think Agent Scully, to an extent.

40:55.400 --> 40:57.900
They might have even prevented
what you see in those photos.

40:57.900 --> 41:00.900
Agents Scully and Mulder have
been suspended by the FBI.

41:00.900 --> 41:04.100
- Also my doing... and my mistake.
- I would ask...

41:04.100 --> 41:10.400
I'd ask, sir; before you tell me that it's
not my business; that you do everything
you can to get them back on the X-Files.

41:10.400 --> 41:15.600
Far worse can happen... and it will.

41:22.200 --> 41:25.800
- Where are you going?
- To pack up my office.

41:26.500 --> 41:29.500
Agent Spender...

41:31.200 --> 41:35.500
You have answers now? Why didn't
I hear about those answers before?

41:35.500 --> 41:39.100
- I've had answers for years.
- Then why didn't we hear about them?

41:39.100 --> 41:41.700
- Nobody ever listened.
- Who burned those people?

41:41.700 --> 41:48.500
They burned themselves. With a choice made
long ago by a conspiracy of men who th...

41:48.500 --> 41:55.700
...thought they could sleep with the enemy.
Only to awaken another enemy.

41:58.900 --> 42:05.500
- What the hell does that mean?
- It means the future is here, and all bets are off.

42:05.500 --> 42:13.100
- Agent Scully, make some sense.
- Sir, I wouldn't bet against him.

42:21.900 --> 42:26.100
- Get out of here.
- This picture you have...

42:26.100 --> 42:28.900
I haven't seen it since you were born.

42:28.900 --> 42:31.000
You probably don't even
know who the other man is.

42:31.000 --> 42:38.300
- I don't care. Get out.
- It's Bill Mulder, Fox Mulder's father.

42:38.300 --> 42:40.700
Isn't that something?

42:40.700 --> 42:45.000
He was a good man... a friend of mine...

42:46.800 --> 42:49.400
Who betrayed me in the end.

42:49.400 --> 42:54.000
I know more than enough about
your past... enough to hate you.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.100
Your mother was right.

42:57.100 --> 43:01.000
I came here hoping otherwise.

43:05.700 --> 43:09.500
Hoping that my son...

43:09.500 --> 43:13.200
...might live to honor me...

43:13.200 --> 43:16.400
...like Bill Mulder's son.
