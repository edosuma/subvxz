-[ship horn sounding]

00:25.147 --> 00:27.580
Gentlemen! My fellow whites!

00:27.580 --> 00:30.048
Let's raise a glass
to this pyramid of money.

00:30.083 --> 00:34.619
The foundation
of which was built upon
our favorite pastime.

00:34.619 --> 00:35.552
Fucking the poor!

00:35.554 --> 00:38.223
[all laughing]

00:38.258 --> 00:40.659
Party's over,
ya pieces of shit!

00:40.694 --> 00:44.095
This is my money now
so back the fuck off!

00:44.130 --> 00:45.965
[all laughing]

00:45.997 --> 00:47.799
Harley Quinn?

00:47.801 --> 00:51.036
[scoffs] I mean,
you think we're afraid
of the Joker's girlfriend?

00:51.069 --> 00:52.137
[chuckling]

00:52.170 --> 00:53.505
-[thuds]
-[screaming in pain]

00:53.506 --> 00:55.371
-So, here's the deal...
-[man screaming]

00:55.371 --> 00:57.276
Are ya gonna shut the fuck up
so I can talk?

00:57.310 --> 00:59.511
[screaming]
I'm in a lot of pain!

00:59.545 --> 01:01.845
Oh, just give it a minute,
you'll go into shock.

01:01.880 --> 01:03.148
-[whimpers]
-[body thuds]

01:03.180 --> 01:04.884
Yeah, there it is.
So, as I was saying--

01:04.885 --> 01:06.918
-[guns cocking]
-You made a big mistake
coming alone.

01:06.951 --> 01:11.951
[laughing]
She's not exactly alone.

01:12.323 --> 01:15.227
She brought a plus one!
[laughing]

01:15.260 --> 01:17.530
It's me, Joker!

01:17.563 --> 01:19.564
Apologies,
but your friend, Rupert,

01:19.564 --> 01:21.865
just couldn't face
coming out here.

01:21.900 --> 01:23.135
[vomits]

01:23.168 --> 01:26.405
[laughing] I'm so sad.
Where's my body?

01:26.438 --> 01:28.353
Puddin'? What the fuck
are ya doing?

01:28.353 --> 01:30.576
You're not supposed to
take his face off yet.
I had this covered.

01:30.609 --> 01:33.646
[stammering]
Yes, but I thought up
that great "plus one" line.

01:33.646 --> 01:36.981
And then I'm not going to
not puppeteer his face.

01:37.015 --> 01:38.551
-[babbling]
-[bankers gagging]

01:38.584 --> 01:40.218
All right, fine. Do your thing.

01:40.253 --> 01:42.421
So, listen up motherfuckers!

01:42.454 --> 01:44.091
Ya better
jump in the harbor right now,

01:44.091 --> 01:45.957
-or I'm gonna kill--
-[Joker laughing]

01:45.990 --> 01:49.027
[all screaming]

01:49.060 --> 01:50.930
God, really?
You just did it again.

01:50.930 --> 01:54.533
[laughing] That's because
I forgot I had the acid bomb.

01:54.566 --> 01:57.135
But we agreed I'm the muscle!
I do the hitting!

01:57.170 --> 01:59.237
[guns firing]

01:59.271 --> 02:01.039
You know,
you're great, you're great.

02:01.072 --> 02:02.941
You do your thing,
I do my thing.

02:02.974 --> 02:04.277
[man screaming]

02:04.310 --> 02:07.147
You're the appetizer.
I'm the entree.

02:07.147 --> 02:09.681
[man screaming]

02:09.716 --> 02:12.451
I can't spend my whole life
just bashin' goons.

02:12.484 --> 02:15.187
When Gothamites
hear the name "Harley Quinn,"

02:15.221 --> 02:16.822
I want 'em to piss 'emselves!

02:16.854 --> 02:18.223
I want a taste of that.

02:18.257 --> 02:20.225
You want a taste of... piss?

02:20.225 --> 02:21.927
No, you know what I meant.
God, listen, puddin',

02:21.927 --> 02:24.663
can't you just see me
in the Legion of Doom?

02:24.698 --> 02:28.866
That is just... [laughs]
You don't want that.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.568
Besides, no,

02:30.568 --> 02:32.507
the Legion of Doom
doesn't give memberships
to sidekicks.

02:32.540 --> 02:35.007
-You have to be--
-Partners.

02:35.007 --> 02:36.093
[under breath] Oh, fuck me.

02:36.093 --> 02:38.912
I wanna be
your partner in crime.
For reals.

02:38.943 --> 02:41.580
-Can we talk about this later?
-If not now, when?

02:41.614 --> 02:46.151
I don't know, tomorrow?
I've kinda got
my hands full right now.

02:46.185 --> 02:48.435
[air whooshing]

02:51.924 --> 02:53.292
Joke's on you, Joker.

02:53.324 --> 02:55.126
Jesus, this guy.

02:55.161 --> 02:56.763
You'll never
take us alive, Bats!

02:56.796 --> 02:59.365
Love that
fighting spirit, Harley.

02:59.399 --> 03:02.032
But in this fight,
I'm afraid I have to

03:02.067 --> 03:03.836
take a dive.

03:03.871 --> 03:05.805
Uh, dontcha mean "we"?

03:05.805 --> 03:08.341
You know
I'd love to take you, puddin',

03:08.375 --> 03:12.745
but I'd never deny you
the pleasure of buying me
time to escape.

03:12.776 --> 03:13.879
[grunting]

03:13.913 --> 03:15.848
Hey, but what if
I get sent to Arkham?

03:15.882 --> 03:18.550
Then you won't spend
even a single night!

03:18.585 --> 03:21.520
I'll break you out, my love.
I swear.

03:21.554 --> 03:25.389
Or actually, uh,
I have something tonight,

03:25.424 --> 03:27.893
but I'll definitely
get you out before breakfast.

03:27.893 --> 03:28.960
Love ya!

03:28.995 --> 03:31.798
["La Cucaracha" horn playing]

03:31.830 --> 03:33.667
[grunts] Ow.

03:33.699 --> 03:36.168
Oh, ain't he cute
when he's escapin'?

03:36.201 --> 03:37.924
-No.
-[gasps]

03:39.437 --> 03:41.007
[Gordon]
You're a cancer, Quinn.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.909
Spreading from
Gotham's lymph nodes
into its spleen.

03:43.943 --> 03:46.846
And God help us
if you get to Gotham's bladder!

03:46.877 --> 03:48.145
But I'm the chemo.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.514
How long's he gonna
keep doin' this?

03:49.514 --> 03:52.019
You're a festering boil, Quinn.
A bedsore.

03:52.050 --> 03:55.020
A tapeworm that sets up shop
in Gotham's lower--

03:55.054 --> 03:56.354
-Jim.
-All right.

03:56.388 --> 03:57.423
Where's the Joker?

03:57.455 --> 03:59.073
I'll never give up my puddin'!

03:59.073 --> 04:01.460
Why are you protecting
a psychotic clown who
treats you like garbage?

04:01.460 --> 04:02.894
Asks the guy who fucks bats.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.162
He doesn't do that!

04:04.197 --> 04:05.430
-Jim.
-Sorry.

04:05.465 --> 04:06.832
I'm not tellin' ya shit!

04:06.866 --> 04:08.901
What me and Mistah J have
is real love.

04:08.935 --> 04:13.639
In fact, not too long ago,
we were on a rooftop
just like this.

04:13.673 --> 04:15.907
That's when Mistah J proposed.

04:15.941 --> 04:18.976
Till death do us part.

04:19.011 --> 04:21.113
Ooh! Told ya!

04:21.148 --> 04:23.886
After we get married,
we'll take a cruise
to Barbados,

04:23.886 --> 04:25.584
or maybe a resort
that's all-inclusive.

04:25.584 --> 04:27.685
They say they're all-inclusive,
but that's bullshit!

04:27.685 --> 04:29.687
They charge you for
the towels! Soap!

04:29.721 --> 04:31.156
-Jim.
-Top shelf liquor!

04:31.156 --> 04:32.524
-Jim!
-Right, right.

04:32.559 --> 04:33.759
Give up the Joker, Quinn,

04:33.791 --> 04:35.360
or you're going to Arkham
for life.

04:35.394 --> 04:37.161
[laughing sarcastically]

04:37.196 --> 04:38.930
[Gordon laughing along]

04:38.964 --> 04:42.701
[laughing hysterically]
Why are we laughing?

04:42.735 --> 04:44.571
'Cause you said "for life"!

04:44.603 --> 04:46.607
-And, as sure as I am
that he fucks bats...
-Okay.

04:46.639 --> 04:50.675
...I know my man'll
break me out of Arkham
before I spend a single night.

04:50.709 --> 04:53.278
[gate clanking and shutting]

04:53.310 --> 04:57.360
[all speaking indistinctly]

05:00.185 --> 05:01.321
Oh! Mistah J?

05:01.353 --> 05:03.889
-Hmm?
-Oh, sorry, my bad.

05:03.923 --> 05:05.757
I mean,
ya looked a little like him.

05:05.791 --> 05:07.560
I don't know
why you bother comin' here.

05:07.595 --> 05:10.196
He's never showing up.

05:10.228 --> 05:11.764
-[choking]
-[thuds]

05:11.797 --> 05:13.999
-Fuck off!
-[Poison Ivy] Yeah, fuck off!

05:14.033 --> 05:15.942
But for the record,
he does have a point.

05:15.942 --> 05:19.103
Just give me 15 more minutes.
Joker's probably
still fightin' Batman.

05:19.137 --> 05:21.005
I don't know, hon.

05:21.005 --> 05:23.910
It's, you know,
most superhero fights,
they're not like, eh...

05:23.910 --> 05:25.577
Calendar Man,
how long has she been in here?

05:25.577 --> 05:27.512
Oh, hey, Ivy! 183 days!

05:27.547 --> 05:31.649
Oh, sure. You remember
the incarceration date
of Porn Clown over here

05:31.649 --> 05:33.819
but not your own
son's birthday!

05:33.851 --> 05:35.586
For the last time,
I'm sorry, Debbie!

05:35.620 --> 05:37.255
Come on! I know it's June-ish.

05:37.255 --> 05:40.791
It's okay, Daddy.
I brought you this cactus
to keep you comp--

05:40.824 --> 05:42.995
[guard] Plant!

05:43.028 --> 05:46.966
There ain't no plant life
within 50 yards
of Poison Ivy, ya moron!

05:46.999 --> 05:49.468
-No wonder your dad
doesn't remember your birthday!
-[crying]

05:49.500 --> 05:51.670
[alarms blaring]

05:51.702 --> 05:54.572
All I'm saying is,
is that you can do
way better than Joker.

05:54.607 --> 05:56.642
I mean,
you're smart, you're strong...

05:56.642 --> 05:57.642
-[grunts]
-[thuds]

05:57.642 --> 05:59.511
You're in control
of your own destiny.

05:59.543 --> 06:01.125
Leave Joker for who?

06:01.125 --> 06:04.750
Some reliable square
who thinks he's "quirky"
for playin' on a dodgeball team

06:04.783 --> 06:06.485
and calls himself
a "beer nerd"?

06:06.517 --> 06:07.821
-[metallic clanging]
-Hmm.

06:07.853 --> 06:09.988
Okay, I know
you're talking about Dan.

06:10.023 --> 06:12.257
It was my first year
at Sarah Lawrence,
there were very slim pickings.

06:12.290 --> 06:13.858
[whimpers and grunts]

06:13.892 --> 06:16.026
I'm just sayin'
the Joker's excitin'.

06:16.060 --> 06:17.362
[grunting]

06:17.394 --> 06:18.430
He's challenging.

06:18.463 --> 06:19.798
He's psychotic.

06:19.833 --> 06:21.934
He threw you
into a vat of chemicals.

06:21.966 --> 06:23.536
You know, I prefer
to think of it as a--
[grunting]

06:23.571 --> 06:27.172
As a vat of freedom sauce!
[grunts]

06:27.204 --> 06:30.776
-[screaming]
-[squelching]

06:30.809 --> 06:33.244
He literally
made me who I am today.

06:33.278 --> 06:34.639
Aw...

06:36.949 --> 06:38.483
[Poison Ivy] Babe, let's,
let's just be honest.

06:38.483 --> 06:39.952
This isn't the first time
that Joker's...

06:39.952 --> 06:42.120
-[sniffs and snarls]
-...left you here to rot.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.488
He does not love you.

06:43.523 --> 06:45.100
Ya have to leave him.

06:45.100 --> 06:48.326
-And don't say--
-[both] You don't
know him like I do!

06:48.360 --> 06:50.696
Harley! Riddle me this.

06:50.728 --> 06:52.331
What did Nadia Comaneci do

06:52.365 --> 06:54.899
when she scored
a perfect ten
on the uneven bars

06:54.934 --> 06:57.470
during the 1976 Montreal Games?

06:57.502 --> 06:59.392
-Win a medal?
-Not menstruate till her 20s?

06:59.392 --> 07:00.442
-Ew.
-She broke a record!

07:00.442 --> 07:01.774
Which is what you sound like!

07:01.807 --> 07:04.944
A broken record.
He's not coming!

07:04.976 --> 07:07.345
That is just
one person's opinion.

07:07.379 --> 07:09.180
[all] He's not coming!

07:09.180 --> 07:12.430
Aw, the fuck do you know?
You're all fuckin' insane.

07:14.185 --> 07:16.690
[sighs heavily]
Or maybe I'm the crazy one.

07:16.690 --> 07:19.524
-[alarm blaring]
-[guns firing]

07:19.524 --> 07:20.524
Mistah J?

07:20.524 --> 07:22.860
[gasps] Mistah J!

07:22.894 --> 07:24.663
-I knew you'd--
-[exploding]

07:24.696 --> 07:26.632
-[gasps]
-[inmates screaming]

07:26.632 --> 07:27.634
Uh,
<i>hola.</i>

07:27.634 --> 07:28.901
Oh, it's you.

07:28.934 --> 07:31.603
[weakly]
How did you get a plant?

07:31.637 --> 07:34.372
I ate an orange
and shit out a seed!
[giggles]

07:34.406 --> 07:36.240
-Thanks, Ivy!
-Okay, let's go.

07:36.274 --> 07:38.244
No! 'Cause I'm waitin'!

07:38.244 --> 07:39.209
For--

07:39.209 --> 07:40.545
Joker, yeah, I got it.

07:40.545 --> 07:42.148
You know how long
you been saying that?

07:42.148 --> 07:45.617
-Calendar Man?
-Oh, hi!
Exactly one year today, Ivy.

07:45.651 --> 07:48.887
One year!
Happy Arkham
Anniversary, Harls.

07:48.922 --> 07:51.990
Here's your present. [blowing]

07:52.023 --> 07:55.827
[gasping]

07:55.860 --> 08:00.264
-[high-pitched ringing]
-[Harley groaning]

08:00.298 --> 08:01.632
[Harley] Uh...

08:01.666 --> 08:03.336
Where am I?

08:03.338 --> 08:05.937
[Frank the plant]
I did not ask
for a fuckin' roommate.

08:05.971 --> 08:08.608
Uh, when you pay rent
you can make decisions, Frank.

08:08.641 --> 08:12.711
Ugh, look what
all those months in Arkham
did to my poor babies.

08:12.711 --> 08:14.478
And where is
that stupid neighbor kid

08:14.512 --> 08:16.548
I hired to water them,
for fuck's sake?

08:16.581 --> 08:19.384
Uh, he quit after a week.
Very unprofes--

08:19.416 --> 08:21.387
[retches]

08:21.420 --> 08:23.755
Really, Frank?
What if his parents
come to look for him?

08:23.788 --> 08:26.257
Unlikely. [retching]

08:26.291 --> 08:28.127
[groans] What am I doing here?

08:28.160 --> 08:29.761
The Joker's gonna go
crazy with worry

08:29.761 --> 08:31.297
when he tries
to break me out of Arkham

08:31.297 --> 08:32.465
and sees I'm not there!

08:32.498 --> 08:34.301
He does not care!

08:34.333 --> 08:36.735
Our escape
was all over the news
and he has not come to see you.

08:36.768 --> 08:38.339
Oh, my God. You're right.

08:38.339 --> 08:40.806
Somethin' terrible
must have happened to him!

08:40.840 --> 08:42.273
[gasps] I hope he's okay!

08:42.307 --> 08:44.076
Oh, my God!

08:44.109 --> 08:46.514
What do I have to do
to prove that Joker
does not love you?

08:46.548 --> 08:50.249
Uh, ya can't.
I am outta here!

08:50.282 --> 08:52.518
[Poison Ivy] For once
you're gonna listen.

08:52.551 --> 08:54.556
You were a genius psychiatrist.

08:54.589 --> 08:56.855
Do you remember
how you diagnosed me?

08:56.889 --> 08:59.591
Sure.
A classic misanthrope
with abandonment issues

08:59.624 --> 09:01.927
who befriends plants
to avoid human intimacy.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.263
-Nailed it!
-Frank.

09:03.296 --> 09:05.464
-[Frank the plant groans]
-You helped me.

09:05.498 --> 09:07.267
I can be around people now.

09:07.299 --> 09:10.989
You know, I mean, I hate it,
but I can do it
without vomiting.

09:10.989 --> 09:13.773
Harleen Quinzel
was the only doctor

09:13.773 --> 09:15.607
who ever got through to me.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.912
What do you think
that she would say to you?

09:18.945 --> 09:20.746
<i>Why are you always tied up?</i>

09:20.778 --> 09:23.782
Oh. [chuckles]
Look how square
and boring I look.

09:23.816 --> 09:25.217
Yeah. You look way better now.

09:25.251 --> 09:27.152
<i>Look, I need some help</i>
<i>with a patient.</i>

09:27.186 --> 09:28.421
Oh. Then, sure. Shoot.

09:28.421 --> 09:29.653
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take a guess

09:29.653 --> 09:31.220
that the picture
is talking to you?

09:31.220 --> 09:33.859
<i>Tell her yes,</i>
<i>but to stay out of it
because we are making progress.</i>

09:33.893 --> 09:36.429
The picture says stay out of it
'cause it's making progress.

09:36.462 --> 09:40.633
<i>So, this patient of mine,</i>
<i>she's fixated on</i>
<i>a murderous psychopath</i>

09:40.633 --> 09:42.201
<i>and won't end</i>
<i>their relationship</i>

09:42.201 --> 09:43.970
<i>no matter</i>
<i>how terribly he treats her.</i>

09:44.003 --> 09:47.004
Oh, easy.
Classic abusive codependency.

09:47.039 --> 09:49.241
You just gotta show her
there's no future with him

09:49.241 --> 09:52.477
and she needs to end it
and find her own identity
and... [gasps]

09:52.479 --> 09:55.346
Oh. I see. You're smart.

09:55.346 --> 09:57.350
<i>I know. I'm you.</i>

09:57.374 --> 10:00.287
<i>The authorities</i>
<i>are still on the hunt</i>
<i>for escaped Arkham inmates</i>

10:00.320 --> 10:04.590
<i>Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn,
and Gotham's funniest villain,</i>
<i>The Rid--</i>

10:04.624 --> 10:06.124
[guns firing]

10:06.157 --> 10:07.559
Screw that guy!

10:07.592 --> 10:10.363
Name someone
funnier than me, Stan.

10:10.395 --> 10:13.230
-Harley?
-What? No! Sta...

10:13.264 --> 10:15.033
Women aren't funny!

10:15.066 --> 10:16.503
[groaning]

10:16.537 --> 10:18.770
She's standing behind you.

10:18.804 --> 10:21.105
-[clearing throat]
-Oh, hey, Harley.

10:21.105 --> 10:22.042
Ragweed.

10:22.042 --> 10:24.643
That's it? Just "Hey, Harley"?

10:24.643 --> 10:26.611
You left me in Arkham
for a year!

10:26.645 --> 10:28.715
You abandoned me,
you lied to me!

10:28.748 --> 10:29.916
But this is the last time.

10:29.916 --> 10:31.417
I am here to break up with you!

10:31.450 --> 10:33.753
Oh, shit! She's dumpin' you.

10:33.785 --> 10:36.388
No, she's not!
She doesn't call the shots!

10:36.422 --> 10:38.490
Yeah, 'cause I'm callin' a cab.

10:38.523 --> 10:39.557
See ya never.

10:39.557 --> 10:40.559
Oh, shit.

10:40.592 --> 10:42.628
Oh, uh, thank goodness.

10:42.628 --> 10:46.131
She's finally doing
exactly what
I prayed she would.

10:46.131 --> 10:47.734
-[Harley] What?
-[Poison Ivy]
Oh, for fuck's sake.

10:47.767 --> 10:49.801
Much as it destroys me
to say it, Harley,

10:49.835 --> 10:51.937
I was going to insist
on breaking up,

10:51.937 --> 10:54.273
because it's the only way
to keep you safe.

10:54.306 --> 10:55.941
What the hell
are you talkin' about?

10:55.974 --> 10:57.876
Yes, no, please
continue with your bullshit.

10:57.910 --> 11:01.181
The world's gone mad
since you've been in Arkham.

11:01.214 --> 11:03.349
Have you seen
Commissioner Gordon?
He's lost it.

11:03.383 --> 11:08.153
He wants revenge
because I "paralyzed"
his "partner." [chuckles]

11:08.187 --> 11:11.758
He and Batman
are hell-bent on destroying
everyone I care about.

11:11.791 --> 11:13.359
That's why
you didn't come get me?

11:13.359 --> 11:14.960
-[Poison Ivy moaning]
-Keeping you away from me

11:14.960 --> 11:17.196
was the only way
to protect you.

11:17.229 --> 11:18.230
And still is.

11:18.264 --> 11:19.932
So, I'm afraid, my dear,
this is a...

11:19.965 --> 11:21.900
Oh, it's a
heartbreaking goodbye.

11:21.934 --> 11:24.403
-Uh, no, no wait!
-No! No "wait."

11:24.437 --> 11:26.306
-This is
what you wanted, Harley!
-Is it?

11:26.339 --> 11:28.807
It is, yes.
You came here to do this.

11:28.807 --> 11:31.443
Yes! Listen to
your awful friend.

11:31.475 --> 11:33.078
So, this is really the end?

11:33.113 --> 11:34.813
-Yep. This is it. Let's go.
-Unless...

11:34.813 --> 11:35.914
-[Poison Ivy groaning]
-Unless what?

11:35.914 --> 11:38.417
Unless our love is so powerful

11:38.418 --> 11:42.054
-even the threat of death
can't keep us apart.
-[gasps]

11:42.054 --> 11:44.590
Oh, screw it!
I'll die for you any day.

11:44.624 --> 11:46.993
-I'm in!
-Really? Me too!

11:47.025 --> 11:48.794
-[Harley] Mwah!
-[both moaning]

11:48.826 --> 11:51.263
What the fuck just happened?

11:51.263 --> 11:52.898
We're gonna need
some privacy, Ive.

11:52.898 --> 11:55.868
Sorry, but it's gonna get
real gross, real quick.

11:55.902 --> 11:58.001
[both moaning]

12:01.573 --> 12:03.975
On and off.

12:04.009 --> 12:05.744
And on and off.

12:05.777 --> 12:07.746
Everything lives
and everything dies.

12:07.778 --> 12:09.114
-Jim?
-I wasn't playing with it.

12:09.148 --> 12:10.883
-[grumbles]
-It's the Riddler.

12:10.883 --> 12:12.018
We hear he's got a riddle
so funny

12:12.018 --> 12:13.384
it makes
people's brains explode.

12:13.384 --> 12:15.620
And he plans to broadcast it
on live TV.

12:15.653 --> 12:17.657
Not if I solve it first.

12:17.690 --> 12:19.292
Oh, and hey,
I was thinking about

12:19.292 --> 12:20.692
having some friends over
to the house for
a barbecue if--

12:20.725 --> 12:22.427
-No.
-All right.

12:22.427 --> 12:26.032
And they say
it's so funny it makes
people's brains explode!

12:26.032 --> 12:27.866
Let me take your mind
off the Riddler.

12:27.866 --> 12:30.537
I made some bread puddin'
for my puddin'.

12:30.570 --> 12:34.907
Okay. [clears throat]
You're not grasping
the impact of this.

12:34.941 --> 12:36.875
Funny is
<i>my</i> thing

12:36.908 --> 12:40.745
and this asshole's
trying to steal it on live TV!

12:40.778 --> 12:42.748
Also, are those raisins?

12:42.748 --> 12:43.649
I mean, why?

12:43.649 --> 12:45.850
[gun firing]

12:45.884 --> 12:47.585
They're chocolate chips.

12:47.619 --> 12:50.589
Sorry.
I do love chocolate chips.

12:50.623 --> 12:51.956
I apologize, puddin'.

12:51.990 --> 12:54.328
It just seems like
every time I turn around,

12:54.363 --> 12:56.995
someone's gushing over
the Riddler.

12:57.028 --> 12:58.764
I mean, seriously,

12:58.764 --> 13:01.967
his whole schtick
is being the world's
most indirect asshole!

13:01.967 --> 13:03.196
Okay, how about this?

13:03.196 --> 13:05.806
If I kill the Riddler
in the next hour,
can we still have date night?

13:05.806 --> 13:08.474
I got a Reese Witherspoon movie
I was thinkin' we could watch.

13:08.506 --> 13:10.743
Well, I do love my Reese.

13:10.775 --> 13:12.110
All right. Kill him.

13:12.144 --> 13:13.879
But it's
<i>Legally Blonde</i>
or I'm out!

13:13.879 --> 13:15.446
It's
<i>Sweet Home Alabama.</i>

13:15.480 --> 13:19.350
This day... sucks!

13:19.384 --> 13:21.287
Wow, how do they
not find these lairs?

13:21.321 --> 13:26.321
And we're murdering everyone
in Gotham in three, two...

13:26.392 --> 13:27.711
Citizens of Gotham,

13:27.711 --> 13:31.663
Riddler here with a riddle
so hilarious...
[laughing]

13:31.696 --> 13:33.198
...you'll die laughing!

13:33.232 --> 13:36.469
Hey, Riddler.
I got some notes on your show.

13:36.501 --> 13:37.836
It's over, Riddler...

13:37.836 --> 13:39.403
Wait a minute,
what are you doing here?

13:39.403 --> 13:40.840
Buzz off, Batsie,
I'm in the middle of doing
a "notes" bit!

13:40.873 --> 13:45.311
[whirring]

13:45.345 --> 13:46.845
[Riddler]
Riddle me this, you two.

13:46.878 --> 13:48.879
What is cold but still burns?

13:48.914 --> 13:52.051
What will eat you
if you drink it? What--

13:52.085 --> 13:53.285
-Acid.
-It's acid.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.388
I am not done.
What is... Wait...

13:55.422 --> 13:57.523
Did I say the thing about
cold but it still burns?

13:57.556 --> 13:58.624
-Yes.
-Right.

13:58.624 --> 14:00.158
-No!
-Because it's acid.

14:00.192 --> 14:02.330
Okay, it's acid.
I'm dropping you
in a pool of acid.

14:02.364 --> 14:05.813
[sizzling and bubbling]

14:07.799 --> 14:09.535
You're makin' a big mistake,

14:09.535 --> 14:11.941
'cause when my man
hears about this,
he's gonna come runnin'.

14:11.941 --> 14:14.774
Precisely what I'm counting on.

14:14.774 --> 14:19.774
Why don't I invite him
over right now for
a little game night?

14:19.946 --> 14:22.282
So you don't
have a riddle so funny

14:22.315 --> 14:23.682
it makes
people's brains explode?

14:23.715 --> 14:24.950
-No.
-I knew it!

14:24.950 --> 14:26.318
You won't
get away with this, Riddler.

14:26.318 --> 14:28.020
If there's no riddle,
why are we here?

14:28.020 --> 14:30.056
To play a little game.

14:30.089 --> 14:32.991
Choose one to live
and one to die

14:32.991 --> 14:35.494
and in the acid,
the loser will fry.

14:35.528 --> 14:37.964
Is it the good kind of acid
that gives you super powers?

14:37.964 --> 14:39.597
-No. Choose!
-[Harley] Aw...

14:39.631 --> 14:41.333
Go ahead. Tell him, Mistah J!

14:41.368 --> 14:43.437
-Deep fry that bat.
-Yes, well, yes, yes.

14:43.471 --> 14:47.706
It would seem an easy choice,
Harley, but... [giggling]

14:47.739 --> 14:51.309
[giggling uncontrollably]

14:51.342 --> 14:52.342
Puddin'?

14:52.342 --> 14:54.547
Even for you
that's a lot of
maniacal giggling.

14:54.580 --> 14:56.849
Sorry, my little
strung-up pheasant,

14:56.883 --> 15:00.186
-but I couldn't possibly
let this punctuation prick...
-[Riddler] Hey!

15:00.220 --> 15:03.288
...get credit for
killing Batman, now, could I?

15:03.322 --> 15:06.825
Free the bat, drop the broad.

15:06.859 --> 15:08.759
[whirring]

15:08.793 --> 15:10.461
[screaming]

15:10.495 --> 15:12.895
[Joker laughing]

15:16.001 --> 15:19.600
[romantic music playing]

15:25.677 --> 15:28.581
Till death do us part.

15:28.614 --> 15:31.350
But that's not
what really happened, is it?

15:31.383 --> 15:33.318
Aw, shit.
What are you
doin' in my memory?

15:33.352 --> 15:35.120
It's my memory, too, dummy.

15:35.153 --> 15:37.791
First of all,
those weren't violinists.

15:37.823 --> 15:40.960
-And you weren't
dancing with Joker.
-[gasps]

15:40.993 --> 15:43.363
And it wasn't
an engagement ring.

15:43.395 --> 15:46.131
But, if all that's true,
then why'd he say--

15:46.164 --> 15:48.467
Till death do us part.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.640
Because he didn't say it
to you.

15:51.673 --> 15:53.173
[whirring]

16:00.011 --> 16:03.081
It was him all along,
wasn't it?

16:03.115 --> 16:04.182
It's always been him.

16:04.216 --> 16:09.087
[Joker laughing]

16:09.121 --> 16:11.456
[Joker laughing]

16:11.490 --> 16:15.693
[Harley]
<i>Joker never loved me.</i>
<i>He only loves Batman.</i>

16:15.727 --> 16:19.530
[bubbling]

16:19.565 --> 16:21.499
[gasps]

16:21.532 --> 16:22.768
[coughing]

16:22.801 --> 16:25.671
[gasps] Ivy!

16:25.703 --> 16:27.273
You saved me from the acid!

16:27.306 --> 16:29.575
It's actually
just margarita mix.

16:29.575 --> 16:30.342
It's still kinda stingy.

16:30.342 --> 16:32.479
Okay, I did my part,

16:32.511 --> 16:35.379
so we're square
for you breaking me
out of Arkham?

16:35.414 --> 16:37.583
His... His part?
What's he talking about?

16:37.583 --> 16:39.619
So don't go all
Harley on me, okay?

16:39.652 --> 16:41.953
But I did set
this whole thing up.

16:41.955 --> 16:43.956
I've been telling you forever
that the Joker's
no good for you

16:43.956 --> 16:47.326
but it seemed like
such a hard concept
for you to understand,

16:47.326 --> 16:49.830
so I decided
to let you see it for yourself.

16:49.863 --> 16:54.166
[groans]
I just wanna crawl back
into that acid and die.

16:54.166 --> 16:57.470
Again, it's margarita mix,
so that doesn't apply.
But look, chin up.

16:57.503 --> 17:01.307
You know, you still got me.
And I care about you so much

17:01.341 --> 17:05.678
that I spent my entire Saturday
setting up something
this fucking stupid.

17:05.710 --> 17:07.446
That's true.
I bet it wasn't easy.

17:07.479 --> 17:09.213
Eh, you know,
the biggest pain in the ass

17:09.249 --> 17:11.250
was just finding
150 gallons of this shit.

17:11.284 --> 17:13.519
I told you
to get a Costco card.

17:13.553 --> 17:15.953
And I told you
I only go there once a year,

17:15.988 --> 17:17.891
so it doesn't
pay for itself, chief!

17:17.923 --> 17:21.960
[groans] I can't believe
I wasted years of my life
on that idiot clown!

17:21.992 --> 17:24.030
Oh, boo-fuckin'-hoo.

17:24.065 --> 17:26.432
I spent ten years
in a dog park.

17:26.465 --> 17:30.369
Come talk to me
after a St. Bernard
shits on your face!

17:30.402 --> 17:32.336
-Frank, Jesus.
-[Frank groans]

17:32.372 --> 17:34.574
Harley, I love you in...

17:34.606 --> 17:38.711
[sighs] In a very odd,
hard-to-articulate way.

17:38.711 --> 17:41.279
And if you just stopped
sabotaging yourself--

17:41.314 --> 17:42.615
-Unlikely.
-Right.

17:42.648 --> 17:46.219
But if you did,
the world would be yours.

17:46.250 --> 17:49.422
And you could be any kind of...
I don't know,

17:49.455 --> 17:51.458
circus performer you want.

17:51.458 --> 17:53.460
Yeah. You know, why am I
still wearing this thing?

17:53.460 --> 17:56.628
-I do not know.
-[doorbell ringing]

17:56.662 --> 17:57.830
Joker-gram!

17:57.864 --> 18:00.400
"Knew you'd make it out.
Let's forget the past.

18:00.432 --> 18:02.768
I sent this idiot to shout,
let's have a bla--"

18:02.801 --> 18:03.970
[tune ringing]

18:04.001 --> 18:06.605
Uh...

18:06.640 --> 18:09.342
Just to be clear.
You don't find this
charming, right?

18:09.374 --> 18:11.576
-No. No, no, no, no, no.
-Okay, cool. Yeah, yeah, cool.

18:11.611 --> 18:14.011
I mean, look, you know,
there's obviously
something super romantic

18:14.046 --> 18:15.547
about a man who explodes...

18:15.582 --> 18:17.349
-Right.
-...another man for you.

18:17.383 --> 18:19.518
But, but no.
No, I'm totally
finished with him.

18:19.549 --> 18:20.854
Oh, finally!

18:20.854 --> 18:22.622
Yeah, yeah! You know,
I am so gonna show the world

18:22.622 --> 18:24.957
I am more
than just Joker's girlfriend!

18:24.990 --> 18:26.557
-There ya go! There ya go!
-Mmm-hmm!

18:26.558 --> 18:28.662
-I'm gonna have my own capers!
-Goddamn right you are!

18:28.662 --> 18:31.395
Like, like, like,
I'll kidnap the mayor of Gotham

18:31.396 --> 18:32.766
and I'll put him in a missile

18:32.798 --> 18:34.467
and I'll just, like,
shoot it at the moon

18:34.500 --> 18:37.503
unless he names
a highway after me, huh?

18:37.505 --> 18:40.007
-Uh, um, okay?
-I'm actually
still workshopping that.

18:40.007 --> 18:42.008
-Yeah.
-But me and the Joker,
we are so through!

18:42.039 --> 18:44.179
Okay, cool, yeah. No, for sure.

18:48.779 --> 18:50.415
[man] Huh?

18:53.451 --> 18:55.386
[Joker] Oh, come on.

18:55.421 --> 18:59.057
Hey, does anyone know
our damn Wi-Fi password?

18:59.090 --> 19:01.992
Harley? Oh. Is that you?

19:02.027 --> 19:03.496
It's me, dickhead.

19:03.496 --> 19:05.330
Uh, by the way,
that's also the Wi-Fi password.

19:05.330 --> 19:08.734
What is?
"It's-me-dickhead?"
or just "me-dickhead"?

19:08.734 --> 19:12.638
Ah, it doesn't matter.
You look fantastic.
Is that new lipstick, or--

19:12.672 --> 19:14.940
-Ya treated me bad.
-What?

19:14.972 --> 19:16.307
-Ya lied to me.
-Aw.

19:16.307 --> 19:18.076
-Ya never loved me.
-Come on.

19:18.076 --> 19:19.443
I know that now.

19:19.444 --> 19:21.413
Well, well,
heh, that's nonsense, puddin'.

19:21.446 --> 19:25.250
My motives are never clear!
I'm an agent of chaos!

19:25.284 --> 19:26.518
That's what you love about me!

19:26.553 --> 19:28.421
Not anymore. We're through.

19:28.452 --> 19:32.090
Oh, yeah, this again?
Look, let me make this clear.

19:32.124 --> 19:34.192
You don't
ever break up with me!

19:34.227 --> 19:36.128
I'm the top supervillain
in Gotham.

19:36.162 --> 19:39.364
Not for long.
'Cause you're lookin' at
your replacement.

19:39.398 --> 19:42.799
You? [laughs] Replace me?

19:42.835 --> 19:44.230
I created you!

19:44.230 --> 19:47.307
You won't even
get out of this building alive
unless I let you.

but you seem good.

21:49.028 --> 21:50.152
Love the new look.

21:50.152 --> 21:52.265
Gonna go pick up

[stammering]
Just text it to me.

21:56.067 --> 21:57.568
-But you're right here.
-Yeah, but,
I'm not gonna remember it.

21:57.604 --> 21:59.271

want some of mine.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.114
You gonna kill me now?

22:08.146 --> 22:12.017
