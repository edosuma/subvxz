"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

00:52.238 --> 00:55.636
"It's been a long time"

00:55.836 --> 00:59.674
"But my time is finally near"

00:59.874 --> 01:04.153
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

01:04.352 --> 01:07.272
"I will touch the sky"

01:07.472 --> 01:11.270
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

01:11.470 --> 01:14.469
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

01:14.709 --> 01:19.387
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

01:19.627 --> 01:22.546
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

01:22.745 --> 01:27.344
"I've got faith to believe"

01:27.544 --> 01:30.103
"I can do anything"

01:30.343 --> 01:34.821
"I've got strength of the soul"

01:35.021 --> 01:37.900
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

01:38.140 --> 01:43.457
"I can reach any star"

01:43.817 --> 01:47.576
"I've got faith"

01:47.776 --> 01:51.494
"I've got faith"

01:51.694 --> 01:56.493
"Faith of the heart"

05:36.012 --> 05:38.452
Doc, isn't my time up yet?

05:55.802 --> 05:58.479
You said 20 minutes.
It's been at least an hour.

05:58.679 --> 06:00.998
I'm getting a little well done in here.

06:02.918 --> 06:04.637
Doctor?

06:06.196 --> 06:07.755
Hello?

11:26.817 --> 11:28.098
Who are you?

11:30.016 --> 11:32.055
I don't understand.

11:35.014 --> 11:36.492
What?

11:39.691 --> 11:42.609
...what I'm saying?
- Sit down.

11:46.207 --> 11:47.806
Who the hell are you?

11:48.125 --> 11:51.044
Who we are is unimportant.

11:51.284 --> 11:52.844
Do you command this ship?

11:53.804 --> 11:55.842
I'm the captain.

11:58.081 --> 12:01.119
- What have you done to my crew?
- They're sleeping.

12:01.318 --> 12:04.877
They won't be harmed
as long as you cooperate.

12:05.916 --> 12:09.834
- What do you want?
- Where is the location of your vault?

12:10.793 --> 12:12.273
Vault?

12:15.950 --> 12:18.030
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.468
Maybe the translator's malfunctioning.

12:21.668 --> 12:23.587
He understands.

12:23.787 --> 12:27.224
This is a vessel of exploration,
not a cargo ship.

12:27.464 --> 12:29.383
We don't do any commerce.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.381
Whatever it is you're after,
you won't find it here.

12:32.581 --> 12:35.060
You carry no valuables of any kind?

12:35.300 --> 12:39.097
- No precious gems? No latinum?
- I just told you.

12:39.297 --> 12:40.656
Liar!

12:44.055 --> 12:46.014
Whoever you are,

12:46.574 --> 12:50.171
just take what you want
and get off my ship.

12:50.371 --> 12:52.770
Cousin, maybe we should.

12:52.970 --> 12:55.089
We've made some good
acquisitions already.

12:55.289 --> 12:58.367
There's more here.
He's hiding something.

12:58.607 --> 13:01.445
I agree with Krem.
Let's take what we have and go.

13:01.685 --> 13:05.483
What do we have?
Scanners, low-grade weapons.

13:05.683 --> 13:09.161
- Nothing but trinkets.
- Don't forget about the females.

13:09.401 --> 13:11.440
Some are worth their weight
in latinum.

13:11.800 --> 13:15.557
If we leave now, we could make
the next slave market on Stameris.

13:15.757 --> 13:19.716
- Slave market?
- You're right, Krem.

13:20.594 --> 13:24.153
Pick out the females that will
bring the best price.

13:24.353 --> 13:26.232
I already have.

13:27.230 --> 13:30.629
It was a pleasure doing
business with you.

13:33.468 --> 13:35.107
Wait.

13:41.823 --> 13:43.582
You've reconsidered?

13:45.300 --> 13:48.099
I'll show you where the vault is.

13:48.299 --> 13:50.378
If you let me keep half the gold.

13:52.376 --> 13:54.256
Gold-pressed latinum?

13:54.695 --> 13:56.695
Gold bars.

13:56.894 --> 13:58.894
Hundreds of them.

13:59.133 --> 14:00.533
But I keep half.

14:01.572 --> 14:03.770
- Ten percent.
- Forty.

14:04.530 --> 14:08.169
- Fifteen.
- Thirty-five. And not a bar less.

14:08.368 --> 14:10.607
You'll never find the vault
without my help.

14:10.806 --> 14:14.405
- Twenty percent. Final offer.
- No deal.

14:14.605 --> 14:16.523
I'd rather you take the women and go.

14:17.283 --> 14:20.441
Thirty-five percent.
That's not a bad offer, Ulis.

14:20.681 --> 14:23.440
- Maybe we should consider it.
- No.

14:23.680 --> 14:28.077
We'll find the vault ourselves.
Krem, start loading the merchandise.

14:28.837 --> 14:32.555
Why am I always stuck
doing the menial labour?

14:32.755 --> 14:34.673
Make him do it.

14:52.663 --> 14:55.902
Oh, not there. Over here.

14:58.980 --> 15:00.859
If you're gonna make
a habit out of this,

15:01.059 --> 15:03.658
you might wanna get a bigger ship.

15:03.857 --> 15:07.255
- It's not my ship. It's my cousin's.
- Really?

15:09.774 --> 15:12.733
I was getting the impression
you were in charge.

15:14.332 --> 15:17.090
This is only my first month
on the job.

15:18.609 --> 15:20.048
How do you like it so far?

15:20.288 --> 15:24.845
My cousin's a skilful merchant.
I'm learning a lot from him.

15:25.045 --> 15:28.844
You'd better slide that over
to make room for the others.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.278
What do you need all this for,
anyway?

15:36.998 --> 15:39.798
You seem to already have
plenty of technology.

15:39.998 --> 15:42.396
One can never have too much.

15:42.596 --> 15:46.394
The Rules of Acquisition say
"Expand or die."

15:46.914 --> 15:49.872
- Rules of Acquisition?
- That's rule number 45.

15:50.072 --> 15:54.389
I've memorized all 173,
including the most important one:

15:54.629 --> 15:59.586
"A man is only worth the sum
of his possessions."

16:00.905 --> 16:03.145
Back on my homeworld,
that kind of thinking

16:03.385 --> 16:05.664
almost destroyed our civilisation.

16:05.864 --> 16:09.021
You should've managed
your businesses better.

16:10.141 --> 16:11.700
Come on.

16:12.379 --> 16:14.978
We have a lot more moving to do.

16:15.178 --> 16:16.937
We?

16:23.213 --> 16:26.891
So, what do you do, split the profits
equally between the four of you?

16:27.090 --> 16:30.250
Oh, my cousin determines
the shares.

16:31.209 --> 16:34.247
You must get a bigger percentage
than your crewmates.

16:34.447 --> 16:36.925
Actually, I get the smallest.

16:39.124 --> 16:43.003
That doesn't seem fair.
You're the one doing all the work.

16:44.801 --> 16:47.560
My cousin knows
what's best for me.

16:47.760 --> 16:50.357
He manages all my
financial transactions.

16:51.237 --> 16:52.636
Really?

16:52.837 --> 16:56.515
I don't have the lobes for business.

16:57.954 --> 17:01.433
I assume he charges you
for his services.

17:01.632 --> 17:06.789
Of course. He wouldn't be a very
good businessman if he didn't.

17:06.989 --> 17:11.306
"Never allow family to stand
in the way of profit."

17:11.506 --> 17:14.624
- Another one of your rules?
- Number six.

17:14.824 --> 17:18.742
My cousin's going to help me
acquire my own ship someday.

17:23.819 --> 17:26.458
Do you think you could bring
me a glass of water?

17:33.494 --> 17:36.932
It comes out of a dispenser
in the mess hall.

17:40.370 --> 17:42.489
I'll be right back.

17:42.689 --> 17:45.568
Do you think you could bring me
some food while you're at it?

17:46.287 --> 17:48.166
Whatever's left in the serving case.

17:48.366 --> 17:51.004
That is, if you haven't already
taken everything.

18:00.319 --> 18:03.037
- You all right, captain?
- Never better. You?

18:03.237 --> 18:06.396
From what I can tell, you and I are the
only ones on the ship still standing.

18:06.595 --> 18:08.716
I would've woken the others,
but there's nothing left

18:08.915 --> 18:10.594
- in Sickbay to do it with.
- I'm not surprised.

18:10.794 --> 18:13.632
These aliens are taking everything
they can get their hands on.

18:13.832 --> 18:16.350
- Who are they?
- I don't know yet.

18:16.550 --> 18:19.109
- Can you get a phase-pistol?
- They've cleaned out the armoury.

18:19.309 --> 18:21.188
There are 14 weapons lockers
on this ship.

18:21.387 --> 18:24.786
- They can't have emptied all of them.
- Trust me, I've already checked.

18:27.105 --> 18:30.982
I've got an idea, but you're gonna
need some help to pull it off.

18:31.182 --> 18:34.420
They used a hypospray to wake me up.
It's in Launch Bay 2.

18:38.938 --> 18:40.937
This is pretty good.

18:41.696 --> 18:43.136
Glad you're enjoying it.

18:43.336 --> 18:45.495
Maybe we should take
your cook with us.

18:47.853 --> 18:49.732
Do you mind?

19:23.793 --> 19:26.952
- Commander.
- You're gonna be fine.

19:31.989 --> 19:35.146
Just because a guy's in his underwear,
you think the worst.

19:35.866 --> 19:38.345
I assume you have an explanation.

19:39.384 --> 19:42.902
Dr Phlox made me clear bio-scan
after I got back from that lunar survey.

19:43.142 --> 19:46.780
While I was in decon, something
knocked out the entire crew.

19:47.579 --> 19:49.739
Aliens are in control of the ship.

19:51.698 --> 19:54.296
That artefact you brought back
from the lunar surface,

19:54.496 --> 19:56.975
it must have been placed
there intentionally.

19:57.175 --> 20:00.532
When I opened it, the canister
released some kind of gas.

20:11.886 --> 20:13.925
This female...

20:14.765 --> 20:17.004
...is different from the others.

20:18.762 --> 20:22.481
- What species is she?
- She's a Vulcan.

20:27.118 --> 20:28.877
Vulcan.

20:29.157 --> 20:32.474
They're really not all that interesting
once you get to know them.

20:32.714 --> 20:35.513
I'd like to get to know this one.

20:36.593 --> 20:39.311
Maybe I won't sell her.

20:40.791 --> 20:43.069
Not right away.

20:44.948 --> 20:46.707
Trust me.

20:47.147 --> 20:51.624
She's got no sense of humour.
She's always complaining.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.261
Krem.

21:14.211 --> 21:15.931
You okay?

21:17.410 --> 21:19.848
There are times I wish Vulcans
hadn't learned to repress

21:20.048 --> 21:22.647
- their violent tendencies.
- Come on, we got work to do.

21:22.887 --> 21:25.086
- What about the others?
- I can't wake anybody else up.

21:25.286 --> 21:27.244
This hypospray is empty.

21:27.444 --> 21:31.203
Let's go. Unless you want
to be sold into slavery.

21:54.846 --> 21:58.163
- There's nothing here.
- You're not scanning deep enough.

21:58.363 --> 22:02.122
This is their vault. I saw one
just like it on a Gavarian ship.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.160
Why would they keep a vault
in the Medical Bay?

22:05.400 --> 22:08.320
Rule of Acquisition number 23:

22:08.519 --> 22:12.957
"Nothing is more important than your
health, except for your money."

22:14.116 --> 22:15.994
I don't see a locking mechanism.

22:16.235 --> 22:18.116
It must use some
sort of magnetic seal.

22:18.315 --> 22:19.875
I'll need micro-charges
to blow it open.

22:20.115 --> 22:21.753
Hold on.

22:32.668 --> 22:34.987
This is a waste of time.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.706
We've only got three hours
before they begin to wake.

22:37.906 --> 22:41.224
- It'll take days to search every hatch.
- We'll find it, Muk.

22:41.423 --> 22:43.305
Be patient. Open those.

22:48.621 --> 22:50.101
Empty.

22:52.740 --> 22:55.578
- I found something.
- Gold?

22:55.938 --> 23:00.296
No, but it looks like
quality merchandise.

23:00.776 --> 23:04.174
- Splendid craftsmanship.
- Add it to the pot.

23:04.374 --> 23:06.772
Do I look like a Menk to you?

23:07.012 --> 23:09.733
This beauty's going in my
personal collection.

23:12.291 --> 23:14.370
We agreed to split our profits.

23:14.570 --> 23:16.809
You said this ship would
make us rich.

23:17.009 --> 23:19.048
We'll be lucky if we break even.

23:19.248 --> 23:22.007
- We had a deal.
- I'm amending it.

23:22.766 --> 23:25.685
Anything I find, I keep.

23:25.885 --> 23:30.522
Fine. I'll just deduct it
from your share of the gold.

24:00.990 --> 24:04.149
What's wrong, Ulis?
Can't find your pot of gold?

24:04.349 --> 24:06.267
- What's all this?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

24:06.467 --> 24:07.827
Don't touch.

24:08.027 --> 24:11.346
If you're not going to help us,
you should return to the ship.

24:11.584 --> 24:14.583
- And what are you doing?
- Looking for the vault.

24:14.783 --> 24:17.223
They're not going to put
it on a map, you idiot.

24:17.463 --> 24:20.780
I know that, but look.

24:22.100 --> 24:26.219
If I'm not mistaken,
these are the captain's quarters.

24:26.619 --> 24:29.738
- So?
- That's where you keep your latinum.

24:31.416 --> 24:33.536
What's the quickest route?

24:33.736 --> 24:37.773
We could take this elevator
to this deck and cut through here.

24:38.613 --> 24:40.212
It's worth a look.

24:42.771 --> 24:44.690
Weapons!

24:46.929 --> 24:49.848
- Where is it coming from?
- Over here.

24:58.605 --> 25:00.683
Make it stop.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.959
Let's get to their captain's quarters.

25:21.514 --> 25:23.513
Where are my scanners?

25:24.033 --> 25:25.752
I left them right here.

25:25.952 --> 25:28.551
You should be more careful
with your acquisitions.

25:31.509 --> 25:34.589
- Open your bag.
- No.

25:35.028 --> 25:38.827
- Open it.
- Are you calling me a thief?

25:39.027 --> 25:42.146
Everybody knows you'd steal the wax
out of your own mother's ears.

25:42.386 --> 25:45.544
Please, gentlemen, we're partners.

25:45.744 --> 25:48.263
Partners don't rob from each other.

25:48.463 --> 25:51.501
Why would I bother taking
some worthless scanners?

25:57.658 --> 25:59.138
Worthless?

25:59.338 --> 26:01.217
I didn't put them there.

26:02.216 --> 26:04.696
Really? Then who did?

26:04.935 --> 26:06.415
I tell you, I don't know.

26:06.615 --> 26:11.732
Maybe they just jumped off the table
and crawled inside.

26:13.412 --> 26:16.370
Where's the other one?
There were three.

26:19.769 --> 26:22.727
- Don't look at me.
- Give it back.

26:24.087 --> 26:26.845
- Get away.
- Come back here!

26:27.085 --> 26:30.804
You heard me.
You cheating, no-good liar.

26:31.724 --> 26:34.563
There. That one.

26:37.401 --> 26:39.400
I'm surprised your friend
didn't get electrocuted.

26:40.599 --> 26:44.118
You can't just yank out an antimatter
injector like it was a light bulb.

26:45.277 --> 26:46.596
Would you mind?

26:48.036 --> 26:50.436
I'll have to take
the injector assembly off-line.

26:52.715 --> 26:56.033
Warp-core parts
are in high demand.

26:59.272 --> 27:03.150
Even if your cousin
does find the vault...

27:04.069 --> 27:06.909
...what makes you think he's
gonna share the gold with you?

27:07.109 --> 27:08.748
We have a contract.

27:08.948 --> 27:12.585
If you never see the vault,
you'll never know what's in it.

27:13.385 --> 27:15.944
He could try to cheat you
out of your share.

27:16.463 --> 27:18.464
He wouldn't cheat me.

27:20.263 --> 27:22.261
What happened to...

27:22.461 --> 27:25.381
..."Never allow family
to stand in the way of profit"?

27:27.580 --> 27:30.178
I've seen the way
the others treat you.

27:31.337 --> 27:34.456
One of them said you have
no talent for business.

27:34.656 --> 27:36.175
Why not prove them wrong?

27:37.135 --> 27:39.414
I've got a proposition for you.

27:40.173 --> 27:42.653
Help me capture your associates,

27:42.853 --> 27:44.892
and I'll show you where the vault is.

27:45.092 --> 27:48.050
We'll split the gold, 50-50.

27:48.770 --> 27:52.729
Once they're in the brig,
you can fly off a wealthy man.

27:53.767 --> 27:56.806
You said you've always dreamed
of having your own ship.

27:59.005 --> 28:01.964
How do I know you won't
double-cross me?

28:03.443 --> 28:06.081
You're the one holding the gun.

28:07.242 --> 28:09.242
Think about it.

28:09.961 --> 28:12.039
No more taking orders,

28:12.239 --> 28:15.839
getting stuck with the menial work.

28:16.039 --> 28:19.596
I'll even throw in the Vulcan female.

28:22.995 --> 28:26.553
So... what'll it be?

28:27.513 --> 28:31.270
Opportunities like this
don't come along every day.

28:38.828 --> 28:40.547
Get back to work.

28:44.465 --> 28:46.385
It's your loss.

28:52.262 --> 28:54.700
Where is the vault?

28:56.219 --> 28:58.980
Do you understand me?

29:01.018 --> 29:05.696
- I can't lock onto its language.
- It's a lower life form, you fool.

29:06.337 --> 29:10.534
- Probably the captain's next meal.
- Don't be so sure.

29:10.734 --> 29:13.132
Look at the size of its ears.

29:14.411 --> 29:18.611
I could get several bars of latinum
for this creature at the Malurzian Zoo.

29:23.410 --> 29:24.968
There's nothing here.

29:25.208 --> 29:27.607
Let's search the other quarters.

29:30.605 --> 29:33.124
I've had enough of
vault-hunting for one day.

29:33.324 --> 29:35.483
You two have fun.

29:56.793 --> 29:58.913
Who's there?

30:05.909 --> 30:08.148
One of the aliens is awake.

31:06.444 --> 31:08.563
Why aren't you asleep?

31:24.035 --> 31:25.915
What's next?

31:27.755 --> 31:29.953
Where do you expect me to put it?

31:30.153 --> 31:32.553
There's hardly any room
left on your ship.

31:32.753 --> 31:36.150
I think it's time you decided
what you really want to keep.

31:37.869 --> 31:39.589
I'll ask Ulis.

31:39.789 --> 31:42.987
Can't you make
a simple decision by yourself?

31:43.947 --> 31:46.425
If you want to run
your own ship someday,

31:46.625 --> 31:49.305
maybe you should start showing
a little initiative.

31:50.144 --> 31:51.983
I'm not the one in charge.

31:52.183 --> 31:54.702
And you never will be,
with that attitude.

31:55.382 --> 31:56.981
Who's this?

31:57.502 --> 31:59.620
My chief engineer.

32:00.140 --> 32:02.779
- Why is he awake?
- Don't ask me.

32:02.979 --> 32:06.617
- Are there others?
- I haven't seen anybody.

32:06.817 --> 32:08.456
You?

32:08.656 --> 32:11.294
The anaesthesia isn't supposed
to wear off for another two hours.

32:11.494 --> 32:14.133
Maybe we used the wrong dosage.
There could be others awake.

32:14.374 --> 32:16.933
- We should leave.
- Not without the gold.

32:17.171 --> 32:20.251
Forget the gold. We'll never find it.

32:21.051 --> 32:23.171
If you want to leave,
take one of their shuttlecraft.

32:23.370 --> 32:27.528
- I'll be happy to keep your share.
- You expect me to go empty-handed?

32:27.728 --> 32:30.766
You can keep the shuttlecraft.
And the females.

32:32.006 --> 32:34.045
That's not good enough.

32:34.245 --> 32:35.723
It will have to be.

32:41.282 --> 32:42.961
You'll regret this, Ulis.

32:44.681 --> 32:46.280
Get out.

32:47.439 --> 32:50.238
Grish, help me with the women.

32:51.118 --> 32:52.757
Wait.

32:53.157 --> 32:56.355
- I'll show you the vault.
- Trip?

32:56.554 --> 32:59.354
Leave the women here,
and I'll let you have the gold.

32:59.554 --> 33:02.112
Not another word, commander.
That's an order.

33:02.312 --> 33:04.911
- I'm not letting them take my wife.
- Wife?

33:05.151 --> 33:07.511
She's not the one with
the pointy ears, is she?

33:07.711 --> 33:11.589
No. Her name's Hoshi. And you're
gonna keep your filthy hands off her.

33:13.347 --> 33:15.307
- Do we have a deal?
- You take them anywhere near

33:15.507 --> 33:18.306
that vault, and I'll throw you
in the brig for insubordination.

33:18.506 --> 33:19.984
You don't give a damn
about this crew.

33:20.184 --> 33:21.983
All you care about
is your precious gold.

33:22.183 --> 33:25.422
- I'm warning you, Trip.
- You're a greedy son of a bitch.

33:25.982 --> 33:27.581
What's your wife worth?

33:27.781 --> 33:30.180
Five bars of gold, maybe six?

33:30.380 --> 33:33.459
Let them take Hoshi,
and I'll give you ten.

33:33.659 --> 33:35.938
- What?
- All right, 15.

33:45.333 --> 33:46.973
Enough.

33:55.089 --> 33:57.208
I accept your offer.

33:57.649 --> 33:59.048
You'll leave the women?

33:59.248 --> 34:01.726
You have my word
as a businessman.

34:05.925 --> 34:07.924
Follow me.

34:11.802 --> 34:14.321
Wait here. I'll go.

34:14.561 --> 34:16.960
So you can cheat us
out of our share?

34:17.159 --> 34:20.038
Hide it in the bottom of your bag?

34:20.277 --> 34:25.277
I plan to count every bar of that gold
myself before it leaves the vault.

34:26.197 --> 34:28.155
We'll count it later.

34:28.355 --> 34:32.234
- Oh, I know you too well, Ulis.
- If he's going, I'm going.

34:32.473 --> 34:34.552
Me too.

34:34.752 --> 34:36.791
We can't all go.

34:37.031 --> 34:39.949
Time's running out. Someone has
to stay and finish loading the ship.

34:40.150 --> 34:42.509
- That's Krem's job.
- I'm tired of doing this job.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.987
- I don't want to do all the menial work.
- Krem.

34:45.186 --> 34:49.427
It's time that I showed a little initiative.

34:49.667 --> 34:51.745
I have the lobes for business.

34:51.945 --> 34:54.862
You just never give me
the chance to prove it.

34:55.063 --> 34:56.822
Get back to work!

35:01.061 --> 35:02.980
Yes, cousin.

35:14.536 --> 35:18.133
You sure told him.

35:20.532 --> 35:22.491
Get back to work.

35:30.327 --> 35:32.327
My back.

35:32.527 --> 35:35.445
- What about it?
- I think I pulled a muscle.

35:35.964 --> 35:39.765
It's an old water-polo injury.
Flares up every now and then.

35:40.484 --> 35:42.203
I just need to rest.

35:43.162 --> 35:47.480
We don't have any time. If Ulis
comes back, and we're not finished...

35:47.679 --> 35:49.280
Then you'd better get working.

36:26.862 --> 36:29.341
- Where are we going?
- Bottom deck.

36:29.541 --> 36:31.342
We already looked there.

36:31.541 --> 36:34.340
You obviously didn't look
in the right place.

36:35.979 --> 36:38.178
After you.

36:47.374 --> 36:49.413
Have you come to rescue me?

36:54.451 --> 36:56.130
How did you wake up?

36:56.970 --> 37:00.648
Whatever put the others to sleep
didn't affect me in the same way.

37:01.248 --> 37:03.846
My body works differently
than the humans.

37:04.366 --> 37:06.285
Humans?

37:07.485 --> 37:09.364
That's the name of their species.

37:09.764 --> 37:11.963
They're a terrible race.

37:12.163 --> 37:15.282
Deceitful, cruel.

37:15.801 --> 37:17.801
Why do you live with them?

37:18.001 --> 37:20.279
It wasn't my choice.

37:20.759 --> 37:23.919
I'm a captive here.
They've enslaved me.

37:28.116 --> 37:30.075
Please take me with you.

37:32.434 --> 37:35.033
You would make...

37:35.793 --> 37:38.191
...a handsome wife.

37:41.150 --> 37:42.671
Do you...

37:42.871 --> 37:44.989
...know how to perform...

37:46.228 --> 37:47.948
...oo-mox?

37:48.148 --> 37:50.866
I'm well trained
in the arts of pleasure,

37:51.066 --> 37:53.465
but I'm not familiar with oo-mox.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.783
My lobes.

37:56.624 --> 37:59.063
Stroke my lobes.

38:02.180 --> 38:04.540
- Like this?
- Yes.

38:06.659 --> 38:10.458
- And this?
- Oh, yes.

38:28.009 --> 38:30.289
Haven't we been through
this section?

38:30.529 --> 38:31.808
Not yet.

38:32.008 --> 38:34.167
I recognise that conduit.

38:34.407 --> 38:37.046
We have a thousand conduits
like that on this ship.

38:37.286 --> 38:41.124
- We're going in circles.
- This way.

38:44.762 --> 38:48.241
- Isn't there a more direct route?
- That's the beauty of this thing.

38:48.441 --> 38:52.119
It's impossible to find unless you
know exactly where you're going.

38:52.319 --> 38:56.757
- How much further?
- Keep your shirt on. It's close.

39:00.476 --> 39:02.195
Watch your head.

39:02.395 --> 39:05.674
Is this your plan,
to walk us to death?

39:06.234 --> 39:10.751
- Is this some kind of trick?
- Relax. We're here.

39:17.987 --> 39:19.347
The vault?

39:21.626 --> 39:24.746
- It's all yours.
- Open it. Open it.

39:29.463 --> 39:31.383
Better let me go in first.

39:31.583 --> 39:34.061
- Why?
- Knowing Captain Archer,

39:34.260 --> 39:36.340
he's probably rigged the place
with booby traps.

39:36.539 --> 39:38.019
Just...

39:38.540 --> 39:40.218
...give me a few minutes
to check it out.

39:40.418 --> 39:43.416
No. You could have a weapon
hidden in there.

39:45.136 --> 39:46.934
I'll go.

39:47.135 --> 39:49.095
Not without me, you won't.

39:49.295 --> 39:52.093
- You'll fill your pockets with gold.
- Get your hands off me!

39:52.333 --> 39:55.131
- We don't have all day.
- Get away from that hatch.

39:55.331 --> 39:56.732
Out of my way!

39:56.932 --> 39:58.650
- Thief!
- I want my share!

39:58.850 --> 40:01.249
- Fine.
- Get back or I'll gnaw your hands off.

40:01.529 --> 40:02.848
My gold, my gold.

40:03.048 --> 40:04.807
It's a trap.

40:22.321 --> 40:25.958
Sorry, fellas, bank must
be closed today.

40:29.796 --> 40:32.555
- Did it work?
- Perfectly.

40:33.995 --> 40:35.806
Do you have the key?

40:40.485 --> 40:42.523
"Not that interesting.

40:42.763 --> 40:46.241
No sense of humour.
Always complaining."

40:52.758 --> 40:54.596
Five bars of gold?

40:56.195 --> 40:59.474
Open these things, sub-commander.
That's an order.

41:35.694 --> 41:37.692
Yeah, Porthos.

41:39.092 --> 41:40.811
You okay?

41:42.650 --> 41:46.367
I'm going to be contacting the Vulcan
High Command as well as Starfleet.

41:46.567 --> 41:48.766
If you come within a light year
of any one of our ships,

41:48.966 --> 41:52.604
- you won't know what hit you.
- You'll never see us again.

41:53.244 --> 41:54.604
If you want to be unshackled,

41:54.844 --> 41:57.881
you might think about showing
Krem here a little more respect.

41:58.081 --> 41:59.361
Vermin.

42:00.920 --> 42:04.997
Release me, and I'll forget
this ever happened.

42:05.597 --> 42:09.115
Later, maybe, if you're nice.

42:09.554 --> 42:12.553
- Let me go, you idiot!
- Shut up!

42:21.788 --> 42:24.267
Are you sure you want to
stay here with the humans?

42:24.867 --> 42:27.824
With my ship and your talents,

42:28.024 --> 42:32.901
we could build a vast fortune.

42:42.536 --> 42:45.975
I'll let you have my latinum pen.

42:46.175 --> 42:48.853
The one you've always
had your eye on.

42:49.453 --> 42:51.211
No, thanks.

42:51.931 --> 42:54.570
My beetle-snuff collection.

42:55.569 --> 42:57.328
Makes me sneeze.

42:57.808 --> 42:59.127
Name your price.

42:59.327 --> 43:01.726
Whatever he offers you, I'll double it.

43:01.966 --> 43:03.404
Krem!

43:03.884 --> 43:05.203
We're family.

43:05.963 --> 43:09.286
I know a Bolian female.
I could introduce you.
