00:00.062 --> 00:01.426
Previously on "Devious Maids"...

00:02.242 --> 00:03.507
Who are you?

00:03.543 --> 00:05.675
I was working for you and your wife, Peri,

00:05.711 --> 00:08.720
but we fell in love, so we got married.

00:08.737 --> 00:10.537
Why can't Spence remember me?

00:10.572 --> 00:11.971
Apparently, this kind of memory loss

00:12.007 --> 00:13.506
can happen with severe head trauma.

00:13.542 --> 00:14.974
How could I ever forget you?

00:15.010 --> 00:16.876
You're the best maid
my wife and I ever had.

00:16.912 --> 00:17.977
Your wife?

00:18.013 --> 00:19.178
Hello, Rosie.

00:19.213 --> 00:20.513
I'm right where I belong.

00:20.659 --> 00:23.560
I couldn't even take care
of myself, let alone a kid.

00:23.595 --> 00:24.727
So I gave my baby away.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.295
Well, my book came out.

00:26.331 --> 00:27.764
And it's on the New York
Times Best Seller list.

00:27.799 --> 00:29.532
Marisol, do you think
we're getting back together?

00:29.568 --> 00:30.867
Said you needed more time.

00:30.902 --> 00:32.802
You said I needed more time.

00:32.838 --> 00:34.471
I'm gonna go home to Seattle.

00:34.506 --> 00:35.572
Zoila, it's time, huh?

00:35.607 --> 00:36.906
Mom's crashing.

00:36.942 --> 00:39.075
You need to tell me who to prioritize...

00:39.110 --> 00:40.242
Zoila or her baby.

00:40.378 --> 00:41.910
That is my petition for divorce.

00:41.946 --> 00:44.547
Adrian, I've spent my
entire adult life with you,

00:44.582 --> 00:46.882
and this ordeal has made me realize

00:46.917 --> 00:49.518
what a terrible waste that's been.

00:49.554 --> 00:50.752
Where is Adrian?

00:54.124 --> 00:55.591
Adrian!

00:55.626 --> 00:57.593
Adrian!!

01:46.675 --> 01:49.243
Oh, dear God.

01:49.278 --> 01:50.410
Help!!

01:50.446 --> 01:52.579
My maid's been murdered!

01:54.650 --> 01:57.384
Who's going to clean all this up?

01:57.419 --> 01:58.152
Ow!

01:58.187 --> 01:59.753
Damn it!

01:59.788 --> 02:02.321
What the hell's your problem now?

02:02.357 --> 02:03.757
You stepped on me.

02:03.792 --> 02:05.925
Please! It's your own
fault! You died on my mark!

02:05.961 --> 02:07.326
I didn't die on your mark!

02:07.362 --> 02:08.928
Are you having fun

02:08.964 --> 02:11.831
watching your book get made
into a big studio movie?

02:11.867 --> 02:14.267
Well, it's not... exactly what I expected.

02:14.302 --> 02:17.836
In the book, Flora is stabbed
and she falls into the pool.

02:17.872 --> 02:19.472
Why did that change?

02:19.507 --> 02:21.006
Peri felt like the audience
was paying to see her,

02:21.042 --> 02:22.775
so her character should discover the body.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.177
But that's not what happened.

02:24.212 --> 02:26.111
Take it up with the head of the studio.

02:26.147 --> 02:27.112
I got bigger fish.

02:27.148 --> 02:28.747
Elliott!

02:28.783 --> 02:31.517
I can't work with her.
She is completely abusive.

02:31.553 --> 02:34.486
All I did was politely suggest
she not perform the scene

02:34.521 --> 02:37.522
like the brain-dead, no-talent
pageant queen that she is.

02:37.558 --> 02:38.991
Ladies, please.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.359
Can we just get along for one more scene?

02:41.395 --> 02:43.428
Oh, hi. Are you taking the dinner order?

02:43.463 --> 02:45.030
Oh, my God!

02:45.066 --> 02:47.199
Are you still hungry after all
the scenery you just chewed?

02:47.234 --> 02:49.934
No, no. I wrote "Coming Clean."

02:51.338 --> 02:54.138
The book that this movie is based on... ?

02:54.174 --> 02:56.208
But you could still take
our dinner order, right?

02:56.243 --> 02:58.210
I'm glad you're here. I was thinking...

02:58.245 --> 03:00.812
shouldn't I be the one who
goes undercover as a maid?

03:00.847 --> 03:02.146
Wouldn't that be better?

03:02.182 --> 03:04.816
No. No. This story isn't about you.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.450
It's about the maids.

03:06.485 --> 03:09.153
It's about... Latina empowerment.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.521
Back me up here, Eva.

03:10.556 --> 03:12.556
Mm, I don't know.

03:12.592 --> 03:14.358
Do all the maids have to be Latina?

03:14.393 --> 03:15.993
Seems kind of racist.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.494
No, it isn't.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.531
Not all maids are Latina,
but these maids are.

03:20.566 --> 03:22.333
If we change the race
of the murdered maid,

03:22.368 --> 03:24.167
we can get somebody better than Eva.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.670
Okay, that's it. I'm gone.

03:28.274 --> 03:31.542
By the way, you are the
meanest person I have ever met.

03:31.577 --> 03:33.844
And I worked on "Desperate Housewives."

03:38.800 --> 03:43.800
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -

03:46.705 --> 03:48.438
Evelyn. I was in Barbados.

03:48.473 --> 03:49.940
I just heard the tragic news.

03:49.975 --> 03:51.274
Thank you, dear.

03:51.310 --> 03:53.276
It's been a devastating six months.

03:53.312 --> 03:55.278
You're such a strong woman.

03:55.314 --> 03:57.447
I'm a survivor.

03:57.482 --> 03:59.181
I will always survive.

03:59.297 --> 04:01.597
You know who else survived?

04:01.633 --> 04:03.499
Me.

04:05.303 --> 04:06.402
Yes.

04:06.438 --> 04:09.204
We are both survivors.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.206
But the house was a total loss,

04:11.242 --> 04:13.608
so thank you for your condolences.

04:13.644 --> 04:16.411
Adrian, how are you?

04:16.447 --> 04:17.879
Still paralyzed.

04:17.915 --> 04:19.714
But the doctors are optimistic.

04:19.750 --> 04:22.217
And he did feel a
tingle in his toes today,

04:22.253 --> 04:24.119
so our hopes are high.

04:24.155 --> 04:27.957
Oh, you are a saint for taking
such good care of your husband.

04:27.992 --> 04:30.792
If you need anything,
please don't hesitate.

04:30.828 --> 04:33.227
Well, you're very popular at the club.

04:33.263 --> 04:35.396
If I'd perished in the explosion,

04:35.432 --> 04:38.399
they would have renamed
the golf course after you.

04:38.435 --> 04:40.201
I'm sorry.

04:40.236 --> 04:41.636
I don't say it enough,

04:41.672 --> 04:45.406
but I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

04:46.676 --> 04:49.777
I adore you, my love.

04:49.812 --> 04:51.912
And I, you.

05:00.957 --> 05:05.425
Mrs. Genevieve, you have a visitor!

05:05.461 --> 05:06.494
Zoila!

05:06.529 --> 05:08.963
Oh, I'm so happy you're back!

05:08.998 --> 05:11.331
I was only in New York for a little while.

05:11.367 --> 05:14.434
Yes, but this is really the
first time we've seen each other

05:14.470 --> 05:17.404
since that sad, sad day at the hospital.

05:17.439 --> 05:19.072
Right.

05:19.108 --> 05:22.675
I hope visiting Valentina
and Remi made you feel better.

05:22.711 --> 05:24.944
Um... sure. A little.

05:24.980 --> 05:26.779
But how is this working out?

05:26.815 --> 05:29.249
Isn't Rosie the best maid?

05:29.284 --> 05:30.984
Oh, yes, she is.

05:31.020 --> 05:34.854
And Mrs. Genevieve is the
nicest boss I ever had.

05:34.890 --> 05:37.790
Rosie, would you be a dear
and go make us some lunch?

05:37.826 --> 05:38.625
Mm-hmm.

05:41.029 --> 05:42.495
I hate her.

05:42.531 --> 05:43.496
What?

05:43.532 --> 05:45.131
No one hates Rosie.

05:45.166 --> 05:46.465
Maybe not the deaf.

05:46.501 --> 05:48.501
They don't have to hear her awful whine.

05:48.537 --> 05:50.302
Rosie doesn't whine.

05:50.338 --> 05:54.140
"Mrs. Genevieeevve, you have a visitorrr."

05:54.175 --> 05:55.807
Stop!

05:55.843 --> 05:57.943
She'll hear you.

05:57.978 --> 06:01.514
Have I mentioned how happy
I am that you're back?

06:01.549 --> 06:04.350
That's the thing. I'm...
I'm not really back.

06:04.385 --> 06:05.984
Oh. Do you need more time?

06:06.020 --> 06:08.153
No. That's not it.

06:08.188 --> 06:09.688
Well, then, what's wrong?

06:09.723 --> 06:11.823
I...

06:11.859 --> 06:14.726
don't feel good about
taking the job from Rosie.

06:14.762 --> 06:16.528
I do! I feel great about it!

06:16.564 --> 06:18.329
But she's living here with her son.

06:18.365 --> 06:20.666
I can't just throw her out on the street.

06:20.701 --> 06:22.333
And I... I just talked to Marisol,

06:22.369 --> 06:24.202
and she has a lead on a job for me.

06:24.237 --> 06:25.670
That's ridiculous.

06:25.780 --> 06:27.580
I'll just have two maids.

06:27.616 --> 06:29.315
What?

06:29.351 --> 06:30.916
You can't do that.

06:30.952 --> 06:32.785
Of course I can. I'm rich.

06:32.820 --> 06:34.920
Oh, I am so happy you're here!

06:34.956 --> 06:37.490
It's gonna be just like before.

06:40.662 --> 06:42.762
Thank you for seeing me, Mr. Hudson.

06:42.797 --> 06:44.429
Ah, "Peter," please.

06:44.465 --> 06:46.766
It's nice to finally meet the
woman behind our next big hit.

06:46.801 --> 06:48.600
Actually, that's why I'm here.

06:48.636 --> 06:49.935
I have a few concerns.

06:49.971 --> 06:52.271
Well, shoot. Your
concerns are my concerns.

06:52.306 --> 06:55.274
Oh. Then why does it seem
like you're about to leave?

06:55.309 --> 06:58.477
Well, unfortunately, I
have another meeting in...

06:58.512 --> 06:59.678
three minutes.

07:01.649 --> 07:03.014
Look, I'm the first to admit

07:03.050 --> 07:05.116
I don't know much about
how Hollywood works.

07:05.152 --> 07:06.485
- W...
- I wasn't finished.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.787
But when I let your studio option my book,

07:08.822 --> 07:11.456
I was promised that the movie
would stay true to my vision.

07:11.492 --> 07:13.992
- I...
- Still... not finished.

07:14.027 --> 07:16.360
Peri Westmore is twisting this movie

07:16.396 --> 07:17.862
into something I hate,

07:17.898 --> 07:19.764
and I need you to do something about it.

07:21.702 --> 07:24.368
Well, don't you have
anything to say for yourself?

07:24.404 --> 07:27.205
Oh, I can talk now. Good.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.808
Why don't we have dinner
tonight... talk about it?

07:29.843 --> 07:32.210
Are you asking me out on a date?

07:32.245 --> 07:33.844
We obviously have a lot to discuss.

07:33.879 --> 07:36.314
Wouldn't it be nicer to do
it over good food and wine?

07:36.349 --> 07:37.981
I shouldn't have to go out on a date

07:38.017 --> 07:39.550
to have my concerns addressed.

07:39.586 --> 07:42.220
It's wildly inappropriate.

07:42.255 --> 07:44.388
That's too bad.

07:44.424 --> 07:46.724
This was the best three minutes of my day.

07:50.763 --> 07:53.530
Now, Peri, after your big win

07:53.565 --> 07:55.365
at the America's Choice Awards,

07:55.400 --> 07:57.534
I'm hearing people say "Oscar."

07:57.569 --> 08:00.337
I'm just trying to enjoy the moment...

08:00.372 --> 08:03.073
shooting a new movie, enjoying my family.

08:03.109 --> 08:04.507
I'm so blessed.

08:04.543 --> 08:07.677
Now, I have to ask you
something a little touchy.

08:07.713 --> 08:09.512
Uh-oh.

08:09.548 --> 08:13.583
A few years ago, you all went
through a very public divorce,

08:13.619 --> 08:15.184
but now you're back together.

08:16.921 --> 08:20.022
Spence had an affair with our maid.

08:20.058 --> 08:22.058
It wasn't just an affair.

08:22.093 --> 08:24.193
You actually married your maid.

08:24.229 --> 08:26.062
I guess I did.

08:26.097 --> 08:27.429
You don't remember?

08:28.599 --> 08:32.835
Six months ago, Spence suffered
a traumatic brain injury.

08:34.605 --> 08:36.538
He almost died.

08:36.573 --> 08:41.443
But that tragic event
brought us back together.

08:43.246 --> 08:44.913
Why did I marry her?

08:46.751 --> 08:50.786
Well, as I've told you many
times, you're an alcoholic.

08:50.821 --> 08:56.591
And our maid was a... was a nasty, mean,

08:56.626 --> 09:00.395
promiscuous person, terribly manipulative.

09:00.430 --> 09:02.630
- Oh! Peri Westmore.
- She sounds just awful...

09:02.666 --> 09:05.066
Don't you just love her?

09:05.102 --> 09:08.236
Mrs. Genevieve, she's with Spence!

09:08.272 --> 09:09.970
The man I was married to.

09:10.006 --> 09:11.539
Wait.

09:11.574 --> 09:14.575
You're the maid who
split up their marriage?

09:14.611 --> 09:16.778
Everything she said is a lie.

09:16.813 --> 09:20.448
She makes it seem like I
tricked Spence into loving me.

09:20.483 --> 09:22.583
But why else would he leave her?

09:22.619 --> 09:25.420
She's America's Sweetheart, and you're...

09:25.455 --> 09:26.753
you.

09:26.789 --> 09:28.823
It doesn't matter anymore.

09:28.858 --> 09:30.291
They're getting remarried,

09:30.326 --> 09:32.592
and Spence still doesn't even remember me.

09:33.963 --> 09:36.663
Rosie, may I give you some advice?

09:37.633 --> 09:39.499
Stop whining.

09:39.535 --> 09:40.968
I don't whine.

09:41.003 --> 09:43.437
Yes, you do.

09:43.472 --> 09:46.840
And if you really want to win
him back, do something about it.

09:46.875 --> 09:48.608
I tried, but I haven't been able

09:48.644 --> 09:50.744
to get near him since the hospital.

09:50.779 --> 09:52.813
Well, then try again.

09:52.848 --> 09:55.949
Now that Zoila's back, take a day off.

09:55.984 --> 09:57.651
Or a week.

09:57.686 --> 10:00.253
Really. Go.

10:06.494 --> 10:09.695
Carmen, this house is absolutely filthy.

10:09.731 --> 10:11.197
I know!

10:11.233 --> 10:13.499
Those construction
workers make such a mess.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.701
All right, all right!

10:18.072 --> 10:19.538
May I help you?

10:19.574 --> 10:22.307
Sorry to just walk in, but
your doorbell is missing.

10:22.343 --> 10:23.876
And also your door.

10:23.911 --> 10:25.277
Yes, forgive the mess.

10:25.312 --> 10:27.179
The house exploded several months back.

10:27.214 --> 10:28.848
Are you Carmen?

10:28.883 --> 10:30.616
The one and only.

10:30.651 --> 10:31.984
Who are you?

10:32.019 --> 10:33.551
I'm Daniela.

10:33.587 --> 10:36.488
Your cousin Josefina's
daughter? From San Juan?

10:36.523 --> 10:37.555
What?

10:39.360 --> 10:40.725
What are you doing in Los Angeles?

10:40.761 --> 10:42.194
I'm on vacation for the week,

10:42.229 --> 10:43.896
and I thought it would
be cool to meet you.

10:43.931 --> 10:45.998
Does your mother know you're here?

10:46.033 --> 10:47.366
She knows I'm in L.A.,

10:47.401 --> 10:49.333
but Tía Yolanda told
me where to find you.

10:50.537 --> 10:53.371
I want to be a singer, just like you.

10:53.407 --> 10:55.373
So... surprise!

10:55.409 --> 10:57.008
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no...

10:58.378 --> 11:00.011
Oh, no, no, no. I'm fine.

11:00.046 --> 11:01.178
I'm fine. I'm fine.

11:05.051 --> 11:06.083
iSanto Dios!

11:07.553 --> 11:09.220
I got to clean this up.

11:15.728 --> 11:16.827
What was that?

11:17.897 --> 11:19.363
Nothing.

11:19.399 --> 11:21.565
Carmen, you're being very
strange toward your cousin.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.900
You got to get rid of her.

11:22.935 --> 11:24.701
Well, she seems like a lovely girl.

11:24.737 --> 11:27.370
She looks exactly like you.
She could be your daughter.

11:30.609 --> 11:33.209
iSanto Dios!

11:39.179 --> 11:40.045
That girl's your daughter?

11:40.080 --> 11:41.146
I was just a teenager.

11:41.181 --> 11:42.882
I had big plans for my life.

11:42.917 --> 11:45.584
So my cousin Josefina,
she raised her as her own.

11:45.620 --> 11:47.486
So she doesn't even know she's adopted?

11:47.522 --> 11:49.154
Nobody knows!

11:49.189 --> 11:51.089
And if she finds out, it's
gonna mess up her whole life.

11:51.125 --> 11:53.591
Her life or yours?

11:53.627 --> 11:56.128
I never should have told you any of this.

11:56.163 --> 11:57.295
- Carmen?
- Yeah?

11:57.331 --> 11:58.630
I have to go.

11:58.665 --> 12:00.598
Oh, no! So soon?

12:00.634 --> 12:02.300
Yeah. I don't want to miss check-in.

12:02.336 --> 12:04.102
I'm staying at this gross youth hostel.

12:04.138 --> 12:06.137
You should stay here.

12:06.172 --> 12:07.839
- What?!
- Well, why not?

12:07.874 --> 12:09.841
We have an infinite number of guest rooms.

12:09.876 --> 12:12.677
But... shouldn't you check
with Mrs. Powell first?

12:12.712 --> 12:14.278
Oh, Evelyn will be so
busy with the remodel,

12:14.313 --> 12:15.780
she won't even notice.

12:15.815 --> 12:19.283
And young Daniela can
get to know her... cousin.

12:19.318 --> 12:22.119
iAy! iMuchas gracias, Mr. Powell!

12:22.155 --> 12:23.620
Isn't this great?!

12:24.990 --> 12:28.025
Huh. You really don't
like hugging, do you?

12:28.061 --> 12:29.460
I'll go get my suitcase.

12:32.398 --> 12:35.466
I'm not going to lie... being
in a wheelchair is boring,

12:35.501 --> 12:39.536
and this promises to be
positively... scintillating.

12:43.542 --> 12:46.276
Gail, I'm so happy you
agreed to do our remodel.

12:46.311 --> 12:48.344
There are so few good interior designers.

12:48.380 --> 12:50.113
Please... I've been dying to get my hands

12:50.148 --> 12:52.649
on that dusty, old
place of yours for years.

12:52.685 --> 12:55.151
Hurtful. But I like the enthusiasm.

12:56.688 --> 12:58.221
I hate to ask, but are we gonna need

12:58.256 --> 13:00.323
those ugly wheelchair ramps for Adrian?

13:02.060 --> 13:04.360
Gail, I need a confidante.
Can I trust you?

13:04.396 --> 13:05.795
Evelyn.

13:05.830 --> 13:07.564
You know you can't.

13:07.599 --> 13:10.567
I heard you traded oral
sex for your eyelid surgery.

13:10.602 --> 13:12.668
You can trust me completely.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.837
I want to divorce Adrian.

13:14.872 --> 13:17.172
Really? You seem so devoted to him.

13:17.208 --> 13:19.208
I planned on leaving
him before the accident,

13:19.243 --> 13:20.910
but now that he's an invalid I can't,

13:20.945 --> 13:22.678
or everyone will think I'm a monster.

13:22.714 --> 13:25.081
Guess your only choice is to
hope he makes a full recovery.

13:25.116 --> 13:27.416
Well, I've hired the best
concierge doctor in town.

13:27.451 --> 13:30.385
And as soon as Adrian can walk...

13:30.421 --> 13:32.254
I'm walking, too.

13:37.261 --> 13:38.727
Are you washing dishes?

13:38.762 --> 13:39.894
Uh-huh.

13:39.930 --> 13:41.930
Hand me that rectangular thing.

13:41.965 --> 13:43.832
The sponge?

13:46.770 --> 13:50.204
You know, it's been six
months since it happened.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.941
You don't have to do my work for me.

13:52.976 --> 13:54.876
I want to.

13:54.911 --> 13:57.679
You're not the only one who
knows how to wash dishes.

13:58.649 --> 13:59.948
Stop!

13:59.983 --> 14:01.915
That's not what this is for.

14:01.951 --> 14:04.218
You're making more work for me.

14:05.288 --> 14:06.787
Oh, please let me help.

14:06.822 --> 14:08.589
You've been through so much.

14:08.625 --> 14:12.293
I know... why don't I make
a snack for you instead?

14:12.328 --> 14:13.961
We have some baby carrots...

14:15.632 --> 14:16.631
Oh, dear.

14:16.666 --> 14:17.998
Miniature carrots.

14:18.034 --> 14:19.266
Petite carrots?

14:19.301 --> 14:21.969
You can say the word "baby."

14:22.004 --> 14:24.004
I just want to make things easier for you.

14:24.040 --> 14:25.272
How about this...

14:25.307 --> 14:27.607
Stop treating me with kid gloves.

14:27.643 --> 14:31.278
Just... be the same old
shrew you've always been.

14:31.313 --> 14:32.780
Will that make you happy?

14:34.483 --> 14:36.283
It's what I want.

14:43.725 --> 14:45.858
Sweetheart?

14:45.894 --> 14:47.860
They're sending a
photographer to our party

14:47.896 --> 14:50.029
so they can blurb about it in People,

14:50.065 --> 14:53.132
so wear something nice, okay, Mister?

14:54.335 --> 14:55.968
Mister. Mister Spence.

14:57.806 --> 14:59.205
Excuse me?

14:59.240 --> 15:01.373
Didn't you call me that
when we were first dating?

15:02.677 --> 15:03.843
Nope.

15:03.878 --> 15:05.678
I've never called you that.

15:05.714 --> 15:07.379
Really?

15:07.415 --> 15:10.949
I think I'd remember calling
you a stupid nickname.

15:10.984 --> 15:13.319
Thought maybe that interview
triggered something.

15:13.354 --> 15:14.886
Oh, well, it didn't.

15:14.922 --> 15:17.989
Nobody's ever called you that... ever.

15:18.025 --> 15:19.325
Peri, it's been six months,

15:19.360 --> 15:20.892
and I still don't remember anything,

15:20.928 --> 15:23.494
and even when I get a glimmer,
it turns out to be wrong.

15:23.530 --> 15:25.330
So your brain is mush.

15:25.365 --> 15:27.833
But it's also a blank slate.

15:27.868 --> 15:29.868
This is our chance to start over.

15:29.903 --> 15:32.003
Okay?

15:32.039 --> 15:33.504
Okay.

15:33.540 --> 15:35.173
Besides...

15:35.209 --> 15:38.309
nothing good happened in
those three years, anyway.

15:43.783 --> 15:46.217
Mommy, play a game with me.

15:46.253 --> 15:47.885
Not now, sweetie.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.688
But here. Have some screen
time. It's good for you.

15:52.091 --> 15:53.324
It's me.

15:53.360 --> 15:55.426
Spence is remembering things again.

15:55.462 --> 15:57.661
I need your help.

16:09.809 --> 16:10.841
iAy!

16:14.813 --> 16:16.913
iAy! Let go of me!

16:16.948 --> 16:17.748
Ow!

16:17.783 --> 16:19.383
Son of a bitch!

16:21.453 --> 16:22.552
Jesse?

16:23.589 --> 16:24.888
What are you doing here?

16:24.923 --> 16:26.390
I'm working.

16:26.425 --> 16:28.224
You work for the Westmores?

16:28.325 --> 16:30.191
Yeah. Yeah, I'm their butler.

16:30.227 --> 16:32.293
And sometimes their bodyguard,

16:32.329 --> 16:33.694
when crazy ladies try to break in.

16:33.730 --> 16:35.796
I'm not crazy.

16:35.832 --> 16:38.032
I need to help Spence get his memory back.

16:38.068 --> 16:39.968
He loves me.

16:40.003 --> 16:41.469
I'm not getting in the middle of this.

16:41.504 --> 16:43.037
I need this job.

16:43.073 --> 16:45.806
Jesse, she's a horrible woman.

16:45.842 --> 16:47.007
Yeah.

16:47.042 --> 16:48.342
Which is why you'll end up in jail

16:48.378 --> 16:49.677
if she catches you here.

16:49.712 --> 16:51.144
Go home.

16:51.180 --> 16:54.615
And for your own good, don't come back.

17:01.268 --> 17:02.234
You went to see Spence?

17:02.269 --> 17:03.235
What did he say?

17:03.270 --> 17:04.569
I couldn't get to him.

17:04.604 --> 17:06.738
Jesse grabbed me and pulled me away.

17:06.772 --> 17:08.073
Jesse?

17:08.108 --> 17:09.374
My Jesse?

17:09.409 --> 17:10.608
He's not your Jesse anymore.

17:10.643 --> 17:12.276
He dumped you. Remember?

17:12.310 --> 17:14.278
When did Jesse get to L.A.?

17:14.313 --> 17:15.747
Why didn't he call me?

17:15.781 --> 17:18.949
I don't know, but he
works for Mrs. Peri now.

17:18.984 --> 17:21.151
Oh, makes sense... She hired a male maid

17:21.186 --> 17:23.253
so he wouldn't sleep with the help again.

17:23.289 --> 17:24.989
How does he look?

17:25.023 --> 17:26.957
Marisol. You're obsessed.

17:26.992 --> 17:28.325
No, I'm not.

17:28.361 --> 17:30.961
Guys, Spence is going to remarry Peri,

17:30.997 --> 17:32.763
and I'm going to lose him forever.

17:32.798 --> 17:34.464
Can we focus on that?

17:34.500 --> 17:36.267
Sorry. You're right, Rosie. Sorry.

17:36.302 --> 17:37.667
What am I gonna do?

17:37.703 --> 17:39.469
I know.

17:39.505 --> 17:41.838
I bet Jesse could help you get
some time alone with Spence.

17:41.874 --> 17:44.107
I tried, but he wouldn't let me.

17:44.142 --> 17:47.444
If you want, I can talk
to Jesse on your behalf.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.647
On Rosie's behalf or your own?

17:50.682 --> 17:52.649
Rosie's.

17:52.684 --> 17:54.183
Mostly.

17:54.219 --> 17:56.953
What?

18:01.692 --> 18:04.027
Whoa. I heard a crash. Is everything okay?

18:04.062 --> 18:05.962
I can't get on the damn Internet again.

18:05.997 --> 18:07.997
Peri changed the password.

18:08.033 --> 18:11.634
I don't think throwing the
computer is gonna fix that.

18:11.669 --> 18:13.803
It just seems like she's trying to keep me

18:13.838 --> 18:16.972
from finding out anything
about the three years I've lost.

18:17.007 --> 18:19.041
She wouldn't do that.

18:19.076 --> 18:20.976
Would she?

18:21.011 --> 18:22.978
Honey.

18:23.013 --> 18:24.980
I have a surprise for you.

18:25.015 --> 18:26.715
I'm really not in the mood.

18:26.751 --> 18:29.552
Well, I don't want to see you, either.

18:30.555 --> 18:31.554
Ben!

18:31.589 --> 18:33.989
Hey! What's up?

18:34.024 --> 18:35.723
- It's been a while, huh?
- Yeah.

18:35.759 --> 18:37.960
Um, Jesse, Ben is my manager,

18:37.995 --> 18:41.830
and he and Spence are, uh... good friends.

18:41.865 --> 18:43.865
And Jesse's our houseboy.

18:43.900 --> 18:45.733
You said I could call myself a "butler."

18:48.339 --> 18:49.971
But I'm great with "houseboy."

18:53.276 --> 18:56.344
Excuse me. Nice meeting you.

18:56.379 --> 18:58.179
Well, I hope you don't
mind me stopping by.

18:58.214 --> 19:00.014
I was in the neighborhood.

19:00.951 --> 19:02.584
Wait. She called you, didn't she?

19:03.887 --> 19:06.253
You went behind my back
and called my sponsor?

19:06.289 --> 19:09.590
You've been so angry and frustrated.

19:09.625 --> 19:11.025
I'm not gonna drink. I'm just...

19:11.060 --> 19:14.728
Scared? Confused? Lost?

19:14.823 --> 19:18.426
Spence, those are all feelings
that could make you slip.

19:18.461 --> 19:22.463
I love you, and I don't
want to lose you again.

19:22.498 --> 19:24.665
Just talk to Ben.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.433
You'll feel better.

19:26.468 --> 19:28.435
You always do.

19:29.872 --> 19:31.171
- Fine.
- Good.

19:32.775 --> 19:34.841
Now, where should we begin?

19:38.714 --> 19:40.447
Danni.

19:40.482 --> 19:42.348
I thought you were going sightseeing.

19:42.384 --> 19:44.250
Oh, Mr. Powell said
that it would be more fun

19:44.286 --> 19:45.618
if you took me.

19:45.653 --> 19:47.120
Yes, it seemed like the kind of thing

19:47.155 --> 19:48.821
that cousins would do together...

19:48.856 --> 19:53.293
taking in the sights, talking
about... cousin things.

19:53.328 --> 19:55.295
Danni, excuse Mr. Powell.

19:55.330 --> 19:57.663
It's time for his pain medication.

19:57.699 --> 19:58.965
I'm not in any pain.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.032
Ow!

20:01.002 --> 20:03.970
Hey, there's a huge
celebrity party tonight.

20:04.005 --> 20:05.370
You want to crash it with me?

20:05.406 --> 20:08.474
I can't. I have to work all night.

20:09.543 --> 20:12.711
Yeah. The Powells are
really, really mean bosses.

20:12.746 --> 20:14.713
Really? Mr. Powell seems great.

20:15.983 --> 20:18.850
He seems great, but
he's really a big perv.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.685
Why do you think he wants you to stay?

20:20.721 --> 20:22.553
He's trying to get with me?

20:22.589 --> 20:24.388
Oh, that man tries to get with anything...

20:24.424 --> 20:25.991
you, me, the sofa.

20:26.026 --> 20:27.058
Don't sit anywhere.

20:27.094 --> 20:28.493
Ew!

20:28.528 --> 20:30.729
Maybe... you should stay somewhere else,

20:30.764 --> 20:32.463
like that nice hostel.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.200
Do you not want me staying here?

20:36.236 --> 20:38.702
Why would you say that?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.070
I'm not stupid.

20:40.106 --> 20:42.039
First, you said a maid got murdered here,

20:42.074 --> 20:44.175
and now Mr. Powell's
trying to sleep with me?

20:44.210 --> 20:46.010
Well, the murder thing was true.

20:46.045 --> 20:48.012
Why don't you want me here?

20:48.948 --> 20:50.814
- Danni...
- Forget it!

20:50.850 --> 20:53.717
Now I know why my mom
never talks about you.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.285
You're kind of a bitch.

20:59.358 --> 21:02.893
So, I hear you had a little
run-in with Rosie yesterday.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.361
- Little?
- Mm-hmm.

21:04.396 --> 21:06.530
She's lucky I didn't call the police.

21:07.899 --> 21:10.200
Listen, if Spence was in his right mind,

21:10.235 --> 21:12.035
he would never stay with Peri.

21:12.070 --> 21:14.204
She's the bad guy here, not Rosie.

21:14.239 --> 21:16.173
But I can't get involved.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.841
All right, I let myself get
personal with a boss before,

21:18.877 --> 21:20.544
and it was a mistake.

21:21.746 --> 21:22.945
Ouch!

21:23.982 --> 21:26.615
Is that why you didn't tell
me you were back in L.A.?

21:27.786 --> 21:30.286
Honestly, I... never left.

21:32.423 --> 21:35.758
You told me that you were
going home to Seattle.

21:35.794 --> 21:38.561
I just needed some space.

21:38.596 --> 21:39.761
From me.

21:39.797 --> 21:42.864
You seemed kind of stuck on me.

21:42.900 --> 21:44.600
I mean, I know I broke your heart...

21:44.635 --> 21:46.101
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

21:46.136 --> 21:47.369
You didn't break my heart.

21:47.405 --> 21:49.905
My heart's just fine.

21:49.940 --> 21:52.741
Well, what about all those
sad, late-night e-mails?

21:52.776 --> 21:53.909
Two e-mails!

21:53.944 --> 21:57.079
And they were not sad.

21:57.114 --> 21:59.715
You just sounded like you weren't over me.

21:59.750 --> 22:03.218
I am so over you.

22:03.253 --> 22:06.922
In fact, I didn't want
to hurt your feelings,

22:06.957 --> 22:08.890
but I'm seeing someone.

22:08.926 --> 22:10.258
Oh.

22:10.293 --> 22:12.093
He runs a movie studio.

22:12.128 --> 22:14.395
He's totally into me.

22:14.431 --> 22:16.964
- Well, congratulations.
- Thanks.

22:16.999 --> 22:20.067
So I guess that means there's
no reason we can't be friends.

22:20.103 --> 22:21.068
- Yay.
- Yeah.

22:21.104 --> 22:22.403
Great.

22:22.439 --> 22:24.004
Friends.

22:27.977 --> 22:30.144
Zoila!

22:30.259 --> 22:32.860
You don't have to do that.

22:32.895 --> 22:34.895
After everything you've been through.

22:34.931 --> 22:38.332
Honestly, I don't need you to
tell me what I've been through.

22:38.367 --> 22:42.069
I keep forgetting I'm not
supposed to be nice to you.

22:42.104 --> 22:44.004
It's good you're scrubbing.

22:44.040 --> 22:47.040
Your upper arms were
starting to get flabby.

22:47.075 --> 22:48.542
Seriously?

22:48.577 --> 22:51.044
I thought you wanted me
to take off the kid gloves.

22:51.079 --> 22:52.879
You don't have to insult me.

22:52.914 --> 22:56.015
Just... be normal.

22:56.051 --> 22:57.517
All right.

22:59.588 --> 23:02.222
I had lunch at the club today,

23:02.257 --> 23:04.090
and you'll never believe this.

23:04.125 --> 23:06.392
It turns out, the butternut squash soup

23:06.427 --> 23:10.763
I always order is cream-based.

23:10.798 --> 23:12.431
Isn't that horrible?

23:12.467 --> 23:14.868
That truly is a tragedy...

23:14.903 --> 23:19.405
the Holocaust, Columbine...

23:19.440 --> 23:21.139
and your soup.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.445
Zoila, what's going on?

23:26.481 --> 23:28.581
I'm really trying here,

23:28.616 --> 23:31.384
but nothing I say seems to be right.

23:38.759 --> 23:43.728
I thought I could do this, but... I can't.

23:43.764 --> 23:45.563
What are you talking about?

23:45.599 --> 23:49.601
Six months ago, you
had to make a choice...

23:49.636 --> 23:51.569
a horrible choice...

23:51.605 --> 23:56.974
between the life of a baby and my life...

23:57.010 --> 23:59.110
and you made the wrong one.

23:59.145 --> 24:00.244
Zoila...

24:00.280 --> 24:02.980
I understand why you did it,

24:03.016 --> 24:06.651
and I know I shouldn't blame you,

24:06.686 --> 24:08.752
but I do.

24:08.788 --> 24:10.454
I blame you.

24:10.489 --> 24:12.089
You were going to die.

24:12.125 --> 24:14.658
And right now, I wish I had.

24:14.693 --> 24:17.795
Your child would have
grown up without a mother.

24:17.830 --> 24:19.130
How is that better?

24:19.165 --> 24:20.864
Because it's not this!

24:22.501 --> 24:25.636
I'm angry all the time,

24:25.671 --> 24:28.972
and everything inside me hurts,

24:29.007 --> 24:31.642
and I don't know how to feel okay again.

24:31.677 --> 24:32.676
I'll help you.

24:32.711 --> 24:34.210
How?!

24:36.014 --> 24:40.150
Being in this place all the time

24:40.185 --> 24:42.718
and seeing you every day...

24:50.562 --> 24:52.628
I can't.

24:52.664 --> 24:53.663
Here.

24:53.698 --> 24:55.898
No! I won't take it.

25:09.921 --> 25:11.154
Thanks for coming.

25:11.189 --> 25:12.121
Yep.

25:12.157 --> 25:14.157
I really love you, man.

25:14.192 --> 25:16.526
You know I'm always here for you, brother.

25:16.561 --> 25:19.895
Okay. I'm gonna go say bye to Peri.

25:22.233 --> 25:24.467
Hey! Is that my shirt for the party?

25:24.502 --> 25:26.669
Uh, yeah. Just picked it up.

25:26.704 --> 25:30.338
Fantastic. I'm really
looking forward to tonight.

25:30.374 --> 25:32.207
Well, you seem...

25:32.242 --> 25:33.575
upbeat.

25:33.610 --> 25:35.477
You say that like it's a bad thing.

25:35.512 --> 25:38.013
But you were so angry
before about your memory,

25:38.049 --> 25:39.481
you thought... you know,

25:39.516 --> 25:41.984
maybe Peri was trying
to keep things from you.

25:42.019 --> 25:43.185
But why would she do that?

25:43.220 --> 25:44.719
No, no, no.

25:44.754 --> 25:46.688
I have to stop fighting
to remember everything

25:46.723 --> 25:48.022
and let it go.

25:48.058 --> 25:51.560
If I keep obsessing, I'll never be free.

25:51.595 --> 25:53.495
You understand?

25:53.530 --> 25:55.497
Uh, n... not really.

25:56.567 --> 25:58.866
You know, you should
spend some time with Ben.

25:58.902 --> 26:01.035
He really puts things in perspective.

26:05.041 --> 26:06.373
Okay, then.

26:06.409 --> 26:07.742
I took care of it, all right?

26:07.777 --> 26:08.843
Thank you.

26:08.878 --> 26:10.211
Absolutely.

26:11.214 --> 26:13.347
I don't know what I'd do without you.

26:16.552 --> 26:18.352
Come in.

26:18.387 --> 26:19.420
- Rosie.
- What's going on?

26:19.455 --> 26:20.754
You were right.

26:20.789 --> 26:22.923
Something weird's going on at that house.

26:22.958 --> 26:24.625
Spence needs your help.

26:27.263 --> 26:29.263
I'll be gone in 20 minutes.

26:29.298 --> 26:30.731
You were right to call me out, okay?

26:30.766 --> 26:31.965
I wasn't being very nice.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.300
So what is it?

26:33.336 --> 26:35.301
You clearly have some issue with me.

26:37.639 --> 26:40.540
I came out here to be a
singer, and look at me now.

26:40.575 --> 26:42.209
I'm not famous or rich or...

26:42.244 --> 26:44.444
- So?
- So...

26:44.479 --> 26:46.412
I'm just a maid.

26:46.448 --> 26:48.414
I'm sure you think I'm a loser.

26:48.450 --> 26:50.150
Why do you even care what I think?

26:51.286 --> 26:53.119
Danni, you're my...

26:54.289 --> 26:55.921
You're my family.

26:55.957 --> 26:58.590
I don't want you to be disappointed in me.

26:58.626 --> 27:00.626
You're not a loser.

27:00.661 --> 27:03.094
You're amazing.

27:03.130 --> 27:06.931
Carmen, after all these years,
you're still chasing your dream.

27:06.967 --> 27:09.801
That's so brave for someone your age.

27:09.836 --> 27:11.236
Hey!

27:11.272 --> 27:13.304
You know what I mean.

27:13.339 --> 27:15.106
You'll stay for the week,

27:15.142 --> 27:19.277
I'll take the afternoon off,
and we'll check out the sights.

27:19.312 --> 27:21.679
Okay, cool.

27:26.953 --> 27:29.254
I thought you weren't a hugger.

27:30.156 --> 27:32.189
I'm giving it a try.

27:35.662 --> 27:38.763
Well, Dr. Ryan, what's the progress today?

27:38.798 --> 27:39.797
Any steps forward?

27:39.832 --> 27:41.131
Which, even as I say it,

27:41.167 --> 27:43.033
I realize is a poor choice of words.

27:45.505 --> 27:47.104
Something wrong?

27:47.139 --> 27:48.672
I'm going to go lie down.

27:48.707 --> 27:51.308
Maybe you should fill Evelyn in.

27:51.343 --> 27:52.642
Are you sure?

27:52.678 --> 27:54.377
She needs to know.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.849
Well, what do I need to know?

27:58.884 --> 28:01.151
I'm sorry, Mrs. Powell.

28:01.187 --> 28:03.720
I'm afraid Adrian will never walk again.

28:05.056 --> 28:06.623
Are you certain?

28:06.658 --> 28:09.459
It's been six months.
There's been no progress.

28:09.494 --> 28:11.628
There was tingling in his
toes! What about the tingling?

28:11.663 --> 28:13.296
Phantom pain.

28:13.332 --> 28:15.332
After the loss of mobility
in the limbs, the body...

28:15.367 --> 28:17.334
No. Adrian will walk again.

28:17.369 --> 28:18.702
He has to.

28:18.737 --> 28:21.503
I'm sorry, but there's simply no hope.

28:21.539 --> 28:24.640
I know it's hard, but
try to stay positive.

28:24.675 --> 28:27.343
Other than his legs, Adrian's healthy.

28:27.378 --> 28:30.479
You should have a long,
long life together.

28:35.220 --> 28:37.720
So, you really don't want to
work for Genevieve anymore?

28:37.755 --> 28:39.321
It's better this way. Trust me.

28:39.357 --> 28:40.756
Well, your timing is good.

28:40.791 --> 28:42.491
A big fashion exec just bought this place,

28:42.526 --> 28:44.360
and she needs a maid to help her unpack.

28:44.395 --> 28:45.494
What's she like?

28:45.529 --> 28:46.695
I don't know.

28:46.731 --> 28:48.230
She got called away to Milan,

28:48.265 --> 28:50.198
so she's gonna be gone for six months.

28:50.234 --> 28:52.667
So... I'm gonna be alone?

28:52.702 --> 28:54.535
Yeah. You okay with that?

28:54.571 --> 28:57.705
No boss, no uniform,
clean whenever I want?

28:57.741 --> 29:00.041
I am great with it.

29:00.077 --> 29:02.077
Yeah, but maybe you should
be around people right now.

29:02.112 --> 29:03.511
No.

29:03.546 --> 29:05.213
I need to get away from
my life for a while,

29:05.249 --> 29:07.849
not be reminded of... everything.

29:09.085 --> 29:10.752
I need a fresh start.

29:10.787 --> 29:12.720
Okay, well, if you need anything,

29:12.756 --> 29:15.055
I am just a phone call away!

29:15.091 --> 29:16.190
Mm!

29:17.460 --> 29:20.261
You heard the part where I'm
excited to be alone, right?

29:20.296 --> 29:22.129
Right.

29:22.164 --> 29:23.063
Right.

29:23.099 --> 29:25.099
- Right.
- Okay. Bye.

29:30.072 --> 29:31.872
Sheila! Breen!

29:31.908 --> 29:33.107
Thanks for coming.

29:33.142 --> 29:34.408
Have you met my manager?

29:34.443 --> 29:36.243
Benjamín. It's a pleasure.

29:36.279 --> 29:38.279
You know, I've been looking for a manager.

29:38.314 --> 29:41.115
Actually, I've got a pretty full
plate with Peri at the moment.

29:41.150 --> 29:43.550
You hear that? He's all mine.

29:44.920 --> 29:47.153
Oh, excuse me. It's the caterers.

29:48.323 --> 29:50.089
You're 30 minutes late!

29:50.125 --> 29:51.758
Do you have any idea how lucky you are

29:51.794 --> 29:53.593
to cater an A-list party like this?!

29:53.629 --> 29:56.229
Mrs. Westmore, why don't
you let me handle this

29:56.264 --> 29:58.431
so you can... get back to your party?

29:58.466 --> 30:01.000
At least somebody's doing their job.

30:01.036 --> 30:03.002
You can set up over there.

30:05.473 --> 30:08.741
Rosie. Spence is alone upstairs.
You won't have much time.

30:08.776 --> 30:10.076
Thanks, Jesse.

30:10.111 --> 30:11.677
I owe you one.

30:19.687 --> 30:21.320
Rosie?

30:21.355 --> 30:26.124
I heard you and... Peri
are... getting married again.

30:26.160 --> 30:27.426
We are.

30:27.462 --> 30:29.662
But you don't love her.

30:29.697 --> 30:30.963
You love me.

30:30.998 --> 30:32.764
No. I know what happened between us.

30:32.799 --> 30:34.132
You tricked me.

30:34.168 --> 30:38.971
We had a beautiful, happy life together.

30:39.006 --> 30:43.675
I know somewhere deep inside,
you must remember that.

30:43.710 --> 30:45.677
You are out of your mind.

30:45.712 --> 30:47.379
Am I?

30:59.693 --> 31:02.660
You still think I'm crazy?

31:02.696 --> 31:04.628
Yes.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.163
I'm with Peri.

31:06.199 --> 31:08.699
And I am not gonna let you
destroy our family again.

31:08.734 --> 31:10.968
Now get the hell out of my house!

31:11.904 --> 31:13.537
I can't believe this.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.876
Goodbye...

31:18.911 --> 31:21.545
Mr. Spence.

31:23.682 --> 31:25.649
What did you say?!

31:28.220 --> 31:29.820
Oh! Sorry!

31:29.855 --> 31:31.254
Rosie, wait!

31:37.029 --> 31:40.863
As long as I'm working
for you, I am happy.

31:40.899 --> 31:44.200
My heart stops every time I see you.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.569
You are an amazing woman.

31:46.604 --> 31:49.705
And you're a good man.
That's why I love you.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.707
I let you get away from me once.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.843
I don't want that to happen again.

32:00.251 --> 32:01.784
Are you okay, man?

32:03.254 --> 32:04.554
I remember.

32:09.849 --> 32:11.882
Danni? Do you want to grab some dinner?

32:12.852 --> 32:15.886
Oh, thank you, but I think
I'm just gonna go to bed early.

32:15.922 --> 32:17.688
It's only 8:30.

32:17.723 --> 32:19.857
I know, but I'm still on Puerto Rico time.

32:19.892 --> 32:21.659
Buenas noches.

32:36.075 --> 32:38.541
I think, in some ways,
an America's Choice Award

32:38.577 --> 32:40.077
is better than an Oscar,

32:40.112 --> 32:43.046
because it comes from...
you know... America.

32:43.082 --> 32:44.214
I need to talk to you.

32:44.249 --> 32:45.715
I'm in the middle of something.

32:47.052 --> 32:48.218
Apparently, Spence's brain injury

32:48.253 --> 32:49.552
has caused him to lose his manners.

32:51.957 --> 32:53.055
Anyway...

32:53.091 --> 32:55.558
Whiskey... neat.

32:55.594 --> 32:57.727
I thought you were sober.

32:57.762 --> 32:59.028
Not tonight.

33:11.909 --> 33:13.809
Give me another.

33:15.446 --> 33:17.046
Pour.

33:18.816 --> 33:23.285
And then he said I destroyed his family.

33:23.321 --> 33:25.954
I've lost Spence forever.

33:26.824 --> 33:30.258
Oh, dear. I hate hearing this.

33:30.293 --> 33:32.427
Because I'm whining again?

33:32.462 --> 33:33.729
No.

33:33.764 --> 33:35.931
Well, yes.

33:35.966 --> 33:38.099
But I can relate.

33:38.135 --> 33:41.769
I may have lost Zoila forever, too.

33:41.804 --> 33:43.571
I'm sorry.

33:43.606 --> 33:45.606
I know you two were close.

33:47.110 --> 33:48.976
But it's you and me now.

33:49.012 --> 33:52.447
And I know just the thing
to make us feel better.

33:54.017 --> 33:55.116
Cleaning!

33:56.319 --> 33:59.420
I think that would only
make you feel better.

34:01.524 --> 34:05.625
Consider it a passing
of the feather duster.

34:05.661 --> 34:07.861
You are my maid now.

34:13.001 --> 34:16.135
Well, I have to admit, I was
surprised to hear from you...

34:16.170 --> 34:17.804
after you called my dinner invitation

34:17.839 --> 34:19.304
"wildly inappropriate."

34:19.340 --> 34:20.606
Oh. Yeah.

34:20.641 --> 34:23.641
Well... I ran into a friend,

34:23.678 --> 34:26.812
and he made me realize
that life is too short.

34:26.847 --> 34:28.281
He?

34:28.315 --> 34:29.982
So is this an ex?

34:30.016 --> 34:32.016
Well, yes, but no one important.

34:32.053 --> 34:34.454
We dated for like a minute.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.621
Oh. Okay.

34:36.657 --> 34:38.489
So, about your movie.

34:38.525 --> 34:39.692
I spoke with Peri's agent...

34:39.726 --> 34:41.326
He told me that he'd left town,

34:41.360 --> 34:43.527
but really, he was just avoiding me.

34:43.563 --> 34:45.496
And he thinks I'm the crazy one?

34:46.667 --> 34:47.866
I totally get it.

34:47.902 --> 34:50.168
I've had my share of crazy exes.

34:50.204 --> 34:52.471
Yeah. I mean, it didn't work out.

34:52.505 --> 34:54.172
So what? I can accept that.

34:54.208 --> 34:56.007
It's not like he was "The One."

34:58.212 --> 35:00.845
Anyway, I told Peri's agent
how difficult she's being,

35:00.880 --> 35:02.714
and they're gonna get her to behave.

35:02.749 --> 35:05.049
Oh, that's great.

35:07.354 --> 35:08.820
Let me ask you something.

35:08.855 --> 35:10.655
Just because a woman
writes a couple of e-mails,

35:10.690 --> 35:14.025
it doesn't mean that she's
still hung up on a guy, does it?

35:15.061 --> 35:16.560
Definitely not.

35:19.565 --> 35:22.366
Well, well. There he is.

35:22.401 --> 35:25.169
Literally, my ball and chain.

35:25.204 --> 35:26.504
Are you okay?

35:26.539 --> 35:28.205
Is there anything I can do for you?

35:28.241 --> 35:29.940
Yes, if it's not too much trouble...

35:29.975 --> 35:32.009
and I hate to impose,

35:32.044 --> 35:34.278
but would you mind killing yourself?

35:35.748 --> 35:36.747
Pardon me?

35:36.782 --> 35:38.582
I despise you.

35:38.618 --> 35:42.019
You have tormented,
embarrassed, and disrespected me

35:42.054 --> 35:44.721
in unimaginable ways for nearly 20 years.

35:44.757 --> 35:46.589
I've wanted to leave you for months.

35:47.826 --> 35:49.359
Then why are you still here?

35:49.394 --> 35:51.628
Because you're in that stupid chair!

35:54.099 --> 35:57.801
And what would people think if I left?

35:59.437 --> 36:02.238
Well, I don't care why you're here...

36:02.274 --> 36:03.606
only that you stayed.

36:05.109 --> 36:08.744
And I'm going to make it my life's work

36:08.780 --> 36:11.414
to make sure you fall
in love with me again.

36:12.617 --> 36:14.083
In the meantime,

36:14.118 --> 36:17.153
don't let me catch you
near a flight of stairs.

36:22.660 --> 36:24.259
Name?

36:24.295 --> 36:25.460
Oh. Um...

36:25.496 --> 36:27.163
I'm a hot girl.

36:28.299 --> 36:30.066
I can see that.

36:30.101 --> 36:32.434
And hot girls get into parties.

36:32.469 --> 36:33.602
Not this one.

36:33.637 --> 36:35.970
Come on. Please?

36:36.006 --> 36:37.506
It's my first week in L.A.,

36:37.541 --> 36:39.908
and all I want is to
go to a celebrity party.

36:39.943 --> 36:42.277
Look, honestly, there's nothing
special about these people.

36:42.313 --> 36:44.246
They're just like everyone else.

36:47.718 --> 36:49.617
Sweetheart, what are you doing?

36:49.652 --> 36:52.120
Don't you "sweetheart" me!

36:52.155 --> 36:55.456
I remember everything about Rosie.

36:55.491 --> 36:57.592
You've been lying to me for months!

36:57.627 --> 36:58.960
Now, calm down. I can explain.

36:58.995 --> 37:01.295
You tried to keep her away from me...

37:01.331 --> 37:03.098
but I know the truth.

37:03.133 --> 37:05.333
And you're gonna pay for what you did!

37:05.368 --> 37:06.967
Spence, you're hurting me!

37:07.002 --> 37:08.802
Spence!

37:20.533 --> 37:21.399
Okay, let's do this.

37:23.003 --> 37:24.235
All right.

37:28.308 --> 37:29.641
Ooh.

37:42.989 --> 37:44.421
Oh, hello!

38:02.841 --> 38:05.175
Oh. I didn't know royalty lived here.

38:06.478 --> 38:07.778
Oh.

38:07.813 --> 38:09.713
I was just having some fun.

38:09.748 --> 38:11.147
Well, I like it.

38:11.183 --> 38:12.482
And now I know I can wear my cape

38:12.518 --> 38:13.649
without feeling embarrassed.

38:14.886 --> 38:16.152
I live next door, by the way.

38:16.188 --> 38:17.353
I don't just come to random homes

38:17.388 --> 38:18.654
and make fun of people's clothes.

38:19.991 --> 38:20.723
Kyle.

38:20.758 --> 38:22.658
Zoila.

38:22.694 --> 38:26.863
Well, I'll be right over there,
Zoila, if you need anything.

38:26.898 --> 38:28.497
Oh, and this is for you...

38:28.533 --> 38:30.499
uh, a gift for the new homeowner.

38:30.535 --> 38:32.568
Oh, actually...

38:34.505 --> 38:36.572
I'm so glad I bought this house.

38:43.881 --> 38:45.981
Ben!

38:46.016 --> 38:47.349
Where the hell are you?!

38:47.384 --> 38:49.051
Peri. Peri. Spence left the party.

38:49.086 --> 38:50.485
But don't worry... I took his keys,

38:50.520 --> 38:51.686
so he's not driving anywhere.

38:51.722 --> 38:53.521
I don't care about Spence!

38:53.557 --> 38:54.723
Do you know where Ben is?

38:54.758 --> 38:56.225
Uh, I'll check downstairs.

38:56.260 --> 38:58.260
Ben!

39:01.431 --> 39:03.598
Oh, my God.

39:04.601 --> 39:07.702
Well, thank you, Peter.

39:07.738 --> 39:09.704
This was a lovely evening.

39:09.740 --> 39:11.506
I'm glad you liked it.

39:11.541 --> 39:13.040
I really did.

39:14.043 --> 39:14.843
Okay.

39:14.878 --> 39:16.344
Yeah.

39:16.380 --> 39:18.580
Well, um...

39:18.615 --> 39:20.514
take care.

39:20.623 --> 39:22.924
"Take care"?

39:22.960 --> 39:24.459
What does that mean?

39:24.494 --> 39:25.994
Well, typically, it means

39:26.029 --> 39:28.830
"Have a good night and
take care of yourself."

39:28.865 --> 39:31.333
Yeah, I... I just thought
you would go with, uh,

39:31.368 --> 39:36.003
"We should do this again"
or "I'll call you tomorrow."

39:36.038 --> 39:37.104
Nope.

39:37.139 --> 39:38.339
Take care.

39:38.374 --> 39:40.140
But I thought we had a pretty good time.

39:40.176 --> 39:41.342
We talked all night.

39:41.377 --> 39:43.778
No, you talked all night...

39:43.813 --> 39:45.513
about Jesse.

39:45.548 --> 39:47.615
And he's right... you
are still hung up on him.

39:47.650 --> 39:48.850
- I am...
- Mm.

39:48.885 --> 39:50.451
I wasn't finished.

39:50.487 --> 39:52.286
Whether you know it or not, you're still

39:52.321 --> 39:54.288
working through your
feelings, which is fine,

39:54.323 --> 39:56.123
but I'm a grown-ass man,

39:56.158 --> 39:58.359
and I've been around the block
enough to know how this ends.

39:58.394 --> 39:59.360
I just...

39:59.395 --> 40:01.195
Still not finished.

40:02.865 --> 40:05.632
I happen to think you're sexy as hell

40:05.667 --> 40:07.001
and smart...

40:07.036 --> 40:08.369
and a little bit crazy,

40:08.404 --> 40:11.070
which is exactly my type.

40:11.106 --> 40:13.573
But I'm not gonna date somebody
who's hung up on their ex.

40:16.745 --> 40:18.745
Well, do you have anything
to say for yourself?

40:30.058 --> 40:32.392
I'm a little concerned about your wife.

40:32.427 --> 40:35.561
When she learned about your
prognosis, she was devastated.

40:35.596 --> 40:39.399
I'm aware, but as long
as I'm in this chair,

40:39.434 --> 40:41.267
she won't leave me.

40:46.106 --> 40:49.875
Which is why I'm paying
you all of this money...

40:49.911 --> 40:52.778
to keep my little secret.

41:01.588 --> 41:03.955
Peri?

41:09.896 --> 41:11.896
Ooh.

41:26.445 --> 41:27.945
Peri?

41:27.980 --> 41:29.713
Peri?!

41:31.483 --> 41:33.383
Oh, my God.
