00:18.755 --> 00:20.955
Might've been
the free and easy laughter

00:20.995 --> 00:22.555
in the air

00:22.595 --> 00:25.715
might've been
the moonlight on the sea

00:25.755 --> 00:28.835
might've been
the warm and friendly

00:28.875 --> 00:30.235
feeling everywhere

00:30.275 --> 00:35.075
but something wild
came over you and me

00:35.115 --> 00:36.995
and we felt
our inhibitions

00:37.035 --> 00:39.355
melt away the snow

00:39.395 --> 00:43.235
though we tried to fight it,
you and I

00:43.235 --> 00:44.155
just about the time

00:44.195 --> 00:47.035
discretion
should have said hello

00:47.035 --> 00:51.595
we watched our good
intentions wave goodbye

00:51.635 --> 00:56.155
what if we both went
a little bit crazy?

00:56.195 --> 00:58.035
Blame it on Rio

00:58.075 --> 01:00.475
what if our hearts
got a little bit hazy?

01:00.515 --> 01:01.875
Blame it on Rio

01:01.915 --> 01:03.355
what if we
acted like fools

01:03.395 --> 01:05.275
broke a few rules?

01:05.315 --> 01:10.795
What do we care?

01:10.835 --> 01:16.275
Blame it on Rio

01:16.315 --> 01:18.715
what if we both went
a little bit crazy?

01:18.715 --> 01:20.595
Blame it on Rio

01:20.635 --> 01:23.035
what if our hearts
got a little bit hazy?

01:23.035 --> 01:24.435
Blame it on Rio

01:24.475 --> 01:26.355
what if we acted
like fools

01:26.395 --> 01:28.075
broke a few rules?

01:28.115 --> 01:30.835
What do we care?

01:30.875 --> 01:34.115
Blame it on Rio

01:34.155 --> 01:37.395
Rio de Janeiro

01:37.515 --> 01:40.395
bum bum bum bum
bum bum bum

01:40.395 --> 01:41.795
la da da da
da da da

01:41.835 --> 01:44.275
bum bum bum bum?

01:44.315 --> 01:46.235
What happened happened.

01:46.275 --> 01:48.115
You just never know.

01:48.155 --> 01:50.035
One time,
the company I work for

01:50.075 --> 01:52.955
transferred me to an island
in the pacific.

01:52.955 --> 01:55.315
Fantastic place.

01:55.355 --> 01:57.715
I invited my girl
To visit me.

01:57.755 --> 02:00.155
I sent her a postcard
every day

02:00.195 --> 02:02.515
with a single word
on each card.

02:02.555 --> 02:03.435
I wrote...

02:03.475 --> 02:05.875
"found a virgin paradise...

02:05.915 --> 02:08.235
"it's yours-Matthew."

02:08.275 --> 02:10.794
Naturally, they were delivered
in the wrong order.

02:10.794 --> 02:12.675
The message she got was...

02:12.715 --> 02:13.635
"found a virgin.

02:13.635 --> 02:16.035
"It's paradise.
Yours, Matthew."

02:16.075 --> 02:18.475
I never heard
from her again.

02:18.515 --> 02:20.835
Vacations
are full of surprises,

02:20.875 --> 02:22.795
to say nothing of virgins,

02:22.795 --> 02:24.635
which brings me
to last year.

02:24.675 --> 02:27.035
It had been
a really mixed-up time.

02:27.075 --> 02:29.475
Just when I got to wear
a smaller retainer,

02:29.515 --> 02:31.835
my parents filed
for divorce.

02:31.875 --> 02:33.275
Kinda took the fun
out of smiling.

02:33.315 --> 02:35.995
I'd been working in brazil
out of Sao Paulo,

02:36.035 --> 02:37.875
the new york of brazil.

02:37.915 --> 02:40.275
Sao Paulo is where
all the work gets done.

02:40.315 --> 02:42.195
Where all the fun gets done
is in Rio,

02:42.195 --> 02:44.315
which is where
my wife Karen and I

02:44.355 --> 02:46.595
decided to spend
our last vacation.

02:46.635 --> 02:48.835
Somehow
I'd never made it there-

02:48.875 --> 02:50.275
by all accounts,

02:50.275 --> 02:53.155
the most exciting, the most
sensuous city in the world.

02:53.195 --> 02:54.595
I didn't know
if this was actually true,

02:54.635 --> 02:56.515
but after 20 years
of marriage,

02:56.555 --> 02:58.235
any fantasy helps.

02:58.235 --> 03:00.155
Victor was coming along,
of course.

03:00.195 --> 03:02.035
That's my friend
Victor Lyons.

03:02.075 --> 03:05.435
He was going through
a bad patch at the time.

03:05.475 --> 03:07.355
This divorce
is gonna kill me.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.235
Phone calls, letters.

03:09.275 --> 03:11.195
Iook at this.
From her lawyers.

03:11.235 --> 03:12.115
Every day something.

03:12.155 --> 03:14.075
If I don't get a letter,
I get a telegram.

03:14.115 --> 03:15.515
We're in more contact
apart

03:15.555 --> 03:16.915
than we ever were
together.

03:16.955 --> 03:20.315
Who knows, maybe the divorce
will save the marriage.

03:20.355 --> 03:21.515
Bite your tongue.

03:21.555 --> 03:22.675
Just one day
in Rio,

03:22.715 --> 03:23.675
you'll forget
all about it.

03:23.715 --> 03:24.595
I promise you.

03:24.635 --> 03:25.555
Tell you the truth,

03:25.595 --> 03:27.275
if it wasn't for Jennifer,
I wouldn't even go.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.955
I don't have to leave town
to be miserable.

03:28.955 --> 03:30.395
It's much cheaper
doing it at home.

03:30.395 --> 03:32.075
When does she get in?

03:32.115 --> 03:33.715
She's on a 3:00 flight.

03:33.715 --> 03:36.355
Imagine what all this
is doing to the kid.

03:36.395 --> 03:38.995
She'll be all right.
Kids are survivors.

03:39.035 --> 03:41.355
Pays to survive, huh?

03:41.395 --> 03:44.875
Half.
That's all she wants.

03:44.875 --> 03:47.715
Wish I had herpes.

03:47.755 --> 03:50.115
I say to myself
she likes 'em

03:50.155 --> 03:52.075
handsome and tall

03:52.115 --> 03:53.955
I had to admit

03:53.955 --> 03:58.235
that I'm not
like that at all

03:58.275 --> 04:02.595
I still don't know what
drew her to me overnight?

04:02.635 --> 04:03.555
Jennifer!

04:03.595 --> 04:04.475
Hi.

04:04.515 --> 04:05.715
Let me
look at you.

04:05.755 --> 04:06.915
You-you're
gorgeous.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.355
So are you.

04:08.395 --> 04:09.755
Yeah.

04:09.795 --> 04:11.715
Well, what happened?
You're almost a woman.

04:11.755 --> 04:15.075
I'm strong, too, daddy.
I won't break.

04:15.115 --> 04:16.954
Oh, yeah.
Right. Sure.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.915
Iook, let me take
your things.

04:18.954 --> 04:19.875
Did they feed you?

04:19.915 --> 04:20.795
You must be beat.

04:20.834 --> 04:22.755
Here.
Give me your purse

04:22.755 --> 04:24.155
this is some radio

04:24.195 --> 04:25.995
you can get a hernia
from rock and roll.

04:26.035 --> 04:26.915
Poor daddy.

04:26.955 --> 04:28.355
I wanted to tell him

04:28.395 --> 04:30.275
he didn't have to feel
so guilty,

04:30.315 --> 04:32.715
but I just couldn't take
that happiness away from him.

04:32.755 --> 04:35.595
My folks were married
almost 50 years.

04:35.635 --> 04:37.275
Never said a harsh word.

04:37.315 --> 04:38.915
Never said a kind word.

04:38.955 --> 04:40.835
They just didn't speak
is what is was.

04:40.875 --> 04:44.235
And I swore it would be
different for Karen and me.

04:44.275 --> 04:47.115
But something was happening
to our marriage.

04:47.115 --> 04:48.995
Nothing earth-shattering.

04:49.035 --> 04:54.755
Just small signs
that a husband can detect.

04:55.715 --> 04:58.595
Karen...

04:59.555 --> 05:01.475
Karen, what's wrong?

05:01.515 --> 05:03.675
Nothing is wrong.

05:03.675 --> 05:05.715
Read your book.

05:05.755 --> 05:07.675
But you're crying.

05:07.715 --> 05:11.075
I'll try to do it
softly.

05:11.115 --> 05:13.955
Is it something I did?

05:13.995 --> 05:16.795
It's nothing you did.

05:16.835 --> 05:20.635
You would have to do
something

05:20.635 --> 05:24.395
for it to be something
you did.

05:24.435 --> 05:27.235
Hold it, hold it.

05:27.275 --> 05:28.715
Do you have room
for these, mom?

05:28.755 --> 05:29.675
Put them
in dad's.

05:29.715 --> 05:30.595
Wait a minute.

05:30.635 --> 05:31.595
You've got more
room than I.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.035
Don't be
such a baby.

05:33.075 --> 05:34.435
Nicole is my daughter.

05:34.475 --> 05:36.395
She also acts
as a sort of branch wife.

05:36.435 --> 05:37.595
This bag's a mess.

05:37.635 --> 05:38.755
Thank you,
darling.

05:38.795 --> 05:41.195
Would you like me
to teach you how?

05:41.235 --> 05:44.915
Jennifer!

05:44.915 --> 05:46.355
Can I put these
in one of yours?

05:46.395 --> 05:47.275
Better not

05:47.315 --> 05:48.275
no problem.
They're perfectly flat.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.195
Then put them
in yours.

05:49.235 --> 05:51.115
I can't.
Nicky's gear is in there.

05:51.155 --> 05:52.995
Matthew,
if you want to use them,

05:53.035 --> 05:54.395
don't put them in here

05:54.435 --> 05:56.115
you mean, if I put these
in your bag,

05:56.155 --> 05:57.795
you won't let me
use them in Rio?

05:57.835 --> 05:58.995
No, Matthew.

05:59.035 --> 06:00.435
I mean, you won't get
to use them,

06:00.475 --> 06:03.075
because you and i
are not going to Rio.

06:03.075 --> 06:04.195
What do you mean?

06:04.195 --> 06:05.235
Exactly what I said.

06:05.275 --> 06:06.755
But we're packing
for Rio.

06:06.795 --> 06:08.835
You're
packing for Rio.

06:08.875 --> 06:10.915
I'm packing for bahía.

06:10.955 --> 06:11.635
What?

06:11.675 --> 06:13.115
How we doing?

06:13.155 --> 06:14.755
Jennifer.

06:14.795 --> 06:16.355
Aunt Karen.

06:16.395 --> 06:17.915
Aw, you look
marvelous.

06:17.955 --> 06:18.835
How's school?

06:18.875 --> 06:19.555
How's
connecticut?

06:19.595 --> 06:20.955
Nice. Tiny.

06:20.995 --> 06:22.515
Hi, uncle Matthew.

06:22.555 --> 06:23.635
Hi.

06:23.675 --> 06:24.715
You want some help?

06:24.715 --> 06:26.315
I got 2 taxis
downstairs.

06:26.355 --> 06:27.915
Well, I'll be
right with you

06:27.915 --> 06:28.835
everything ok?

06:28.835 --> 06:32.435
Yeah. Just give us
a few minutes.

06:32.475 --> 06:36.035
Help Nicky take
her bags downstairs.

06:36.075 --> 06:38.235
What do you mean,
bahía?

06:38.235 --> 06:40.315
Club med. For a month.

06:40.355 --> 06:41.435
When did you
decide all this?

06:41.435 --> 06:42.835
Weeks ago.

06:42.875 --> 06:44.075
And you didn't
tell me?

06:44.075 --> 06:45.235
I didn't want
to upset you.

06:45.235 --> 06:47.155
Oh, not until
just the right moment, eh?

06:47.195 --> 06:48.595
When you're
gonna upset someone,

06:48.595 --> 06:50.035
you're gonna do
a proper job of it, right?

06:50.075 --> 06:51.475
This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

06:51.515 --> 06:52.395
What do you expect?

06:52.435 --> 06:53.835
We're supposed to be
going on vacation.

06:53.875 --> 06:56.275
We are going on vacation.
Just 2 different ones.

06:56.315 --> 06:57.675
But why?

06:57.715 --> 06:59.115
You haven't a clue?

06:59.155 --> 07:00.595
Why, am I boring
when we're together?

07:00.635 --> 07:01.995
Close.

07:02.035 --> 07:03.475
I'm boring
when we're together.

07:03.515 --> 07:04.915
Who said?
You.

07:04.955 --> 07:05.955
Never.

07:05.955 --> 07:06.915
Haven't you said
there were times

07:06.955 --> 07:07.835
you'd rather be
without me?

07:07.875 --> 07:09.555
Ah, that's only
when I'm with you.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.235
Most of the time,
we're too together.

07:11.275 --> 07:12.155
Sometimes we're so us,

07:12.195 --> 07:15.075
I forget what it's like
just to be me.

07:15.115 --> 07:17.955
But when we're apart,
I miss you terribly.

07:17.995 --> 07:20.115
Karen...

07:20.155 --> 07:22.235
the truth.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.915
Is there someone
in your life?

07:24.955 --> 07:27.555
There's no one
in my life.

07:27.595 --> 07:31.355
No one.

07:31.395 --> 07:32.355
Well, I thought I was.

07:32.395 --> 07:34.235
Barely, Matthew.

07:34.275 --> 07:36.675
Just a little bit more
than I'm in yours.

07:36.675 --> 07:38.555
Iook, I'm sorry.

07:38.595 --> 07:39.715
I- I know I was wrong.

07:39.755 --> 07:40.835
About what

07:40.875 --> 07:42.235
about whatever you think
I was wrong about.

07:42.235 --> 07:43.635
I admit it.

07:43.675 --> 07:45.275
I didn't say you'd
done anything wrong.

07:45.315 --> 07:46.715
All right.
Then I deny it.

07:46.755 --> 07:47.835
Whatever works here.

07:47.875 --> 07:49.315
Please, darling.
Victor's waiting.

07:49.355 --> 07:52.155
The hell with Victor.

07:52.195 --> 07:54.115
Hey, guys,
we got a plane to catch.

07:54.155 --> 07:55.515
She's not going.

07:55.555 --> 07:56.995
What do you mean
you're not going?

07:57.035 --> 07:58.395
What happened?

07:58.435 --> 08:00.115
What, did you have
a fight? What?

08:00.155 --> 08:01.875
I don't have to answer
to you, too, Victor.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.595
I don't get it.
Who packs not to leave?

08:03.635 --> 08:05.475
She's going
to bahía.

08:05.515 --> 08:07.795
But we're going to Rio.
Didn't we say Rio?

08:07.795 --> 08:10.035
Victor, this is
between me and Matthew.

08:10.075 --> 08:11.475
We did say Rio,
didn't we?

08:11.515 --> 08:12.395
We did.

08:12.435 --> 08:13.875
Then what the hell
is in Bahía?

08:13.915 --> 08:15.315
Not me.
That's the big attraction.

08:15.355 --> 08:16.635
That's not fair.

08:16.635 --> 08:17.875
What's going on?

08:17.915 --> 08:19.835
Matthew will
explain it all

08:19.835 --> 08:22.355
what do I tell
Nicky?

08:22.395 --> 08:24.915
I'll talk to Nicky.

08:24.915 --> 08:26.955
She's serious.

08:26.995 --> 08:28.915
We're not going
until I change her mind.

08:28.955 --> 08:31.475
The flight without her
was awful.

08:31.515 --> 08:33.715
She was all
I could think about.

08:33.755 --> 08:35.875
I was up to my ears
in my marriage.

08:35.914 --> 08:38.315
Victor was up to my ears
in his divorce.

08:38.355 --> 08:39.554
How you doing?

08:39.554 --> 08:40.674
It's the lawyers.

08:40.715 --> 08:42.635
You'd think
I cheated on them.

08:42.674 --> 08:44.515
They feed on misery.

08:44.555 --> 08:45.995
Show me 2 people
breaking up,

08:46.035 --> 08:46.915
and I'll show you

08:46.955 --> 08:48.955
lawyers flying
lazy circles.

08:48.955 --> 08:53.395
Thank god for Rio-
just the thought of it.

08:53.435 --> 08:55.275
My Rio

08:55.315 --> 08:56.995
Rio by the sea-o

08:56.995 --> 08:58.635
flying down to Rio

08:58.675 --> 09:01.235
where there's rhythm
and rhyme

09:01.275 --> 09:03.315
say, feller

09:03.355 --> 09:05.235
twirl that ol' propeller

09:05.275 --> 09:09.595
we've got to get to Rio,
and we've got to make time

09:09.635 --> 09:11.475
you'll love it

09:11.515 --> 09:13.195
soaring high above it

09:13.235 --> 09:14.995
looking down on Rio

09:15.035 --> 09:16.755
from a heaven up above

09:16.795 --> 09:21.075
send a radio
to Rio de Janeiro

09:21.115 --> 09:23.435
with a big hello
just so they'll know

09:23.475 --> 09:25.795
and stand by there,
we'll fly there

09:25.835 --> 09:27.315
my Rio

09:27.315 --> 09:29.235
everything will be ok

09:29.235 --> 09:31.955
we're singing and winging
our way to you?

09:31.955 --> 09:34.635
Please, could you fasten
the seat belts

09:34.635 --> 09:36.515
and observe
the no smoking sign.

09:36.555 --> 09:42.475
In a few minutes,
we are going to land in Rio.

10:32.755 --> 10:34.435
He's gorgeous!

10:34.435 --> 10:36.075
I saw him first.

10:36.075 --> 10:40.875
How'd you like to lose
about 2 feet off your nose?

10:45.195 --> 10:46.115
You creep!

10:46.155 --> 10:48.075
That's the temper
we all know and love.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.475
I don't have
a temper.

10:49.515 --> 10:53.635
You'd kill anyone
who says so.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.435
Maybe we ought to talk
about boys.

11:03.475 --> 11:04.355
Boys?

11:04.395 --> 11:05.795
Ground rules.

11:05.835 --> 11:07.755
That's if we get
any boys on the ground.

11:07.795 --> 11:08.675
Come on. He's talking.

11:08.715 --> 11:10.115
I think
we should all agree

11:10.155 --> 11:13.035
on what time you come home
if you're on a date.

11:13.035 --> 11:14.475
How does 11:00 sound,
Victor?

11:14.475 --> 11:15.395
11:00 sounds good.

11:15.435 --> 11:16.835
I think 11:00
is sensible.

11:16.875 --> 11:17.795
11:00?

11:17.795 --> 11:18.755
The next morning,
right?

11:18.795 --> 11:20.195
I'm sure.

11:20.195 --> 11:21.155
I don't get made up
till 11:00.

11:21.195 --> 11:22.115
How about midn-

11:22.155 --> 11:23.115
1:00.

11:23.155 --> 11:23.995
1:00?

11:24.035 --> 11:26.715
Midnight.
What do you think?

11:26.755 --> 11:29.395
No later.
Midnight's plenty.

11:29.435 --> 11:31.835
Mother lets me
come home at 1:00.

11:31.835 --> 11:33.235
Oh, yeah?

11:33.235 --> 11:36.115
Well, I don't know
if, uh...

11:36.155 --> 11:38.995
well, let's see.
We'll talk.

11:39.035 --> 11:40.395
What?

11:40.435 --> 11:43.475
I didn't say
anything.

11:43.515 --> 11:46.475
I'm just
thinking it.

12:02.515 --> 12:04.395
Are we almost there?

12:04.435 --> 12:05.835
I don't know.
Soon I think.

12:05.875 --> 12:07.795
You rented a house,
you don't know where it is?

12:07.795 --> 12:09.195
It's soon.

12:09.235 --> 12:12.635
Soon is all you know?

12:12.675 --> 12:16.035
That's better than later.

12:31.555 --> 12:35.395
Iook at this.
It's fabulous.

12:35.435 --> 12:36.795
It's beautiful.

12:36.835 --> 12:38.715
It's awfully high up,
isn't it?

12:38.755 --> 12:40.675
Why does a house
have to be so high up?

12:40.715 --> 12:42.355
I won't let you fall,
daddy.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.035
Come on, let's go
see our room.

12:44.075 --> 12:45.915
Aah!

12:45.955 --> 12:47.395
It's only an iguana.

12:47.435 --> 12:48.315
I hate lizards.

12:48.355 --> 12:51.715
Lizards hate lizards.

12:51.755 --> 12:53.115
Ah. Boa tarde.

12:53.155 --> 12:57.475
Eu sou Matthew Hollis.

12:57.475 --> 13:01.795
She's crazy
about you.

13:01.835 --> 13:06.075
Hey!
Look at this.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.595
It's an egg.

13:11.635 --> 13:14.195
That's a sign.

13:14.235 --> 13:16.635
It's still warm.
What's it a sign of?

13:16.675 --> 13:17.555
Fertility.

13:17.595 --> 13:19.995
Or an omelet.
Whichever comes first.

13:20.035 --> 13:23.395
Come on,
Nicky.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.315
Matthew,
promise me something.

13:25.355 --> 13:29.195
Promise you'll try
to have a good time.

13:35.915 --> 13:41.155
I say to myself she likes 'em
handsome and tall

13:41.195 --> 13:46.515
I had to admit
that I'm not like that at all

13:46.555 --> 13:51.835
I still don't know
what drew her to me overnight

13:51.875 --> 14:00.195
I must be
doing something right?

14:00.195 --> 14:04.675
Lawyers!

14:05.155 --> 14:06.595
Time to get up,
you lot.

14:06.635 --> 14:07.555
Jennifer...

14:07.595 --> 14:08.475
mmm?

14:08.515 --> 14:09.595
We want to get
to the beach early.

14:09.595 --> 14:12.235
Come on, Nicky.

14:12.275 --> 14:14.835
Are you up?

14:14.875 --> 14:17.715
Half.

14:17.715 --> 14:20.075
Your father's
so sweet.

14:20.115 --> 14:23.955
I used to have
a crush on him.

14:23.995 --> 14:27.795
Me, too.

14:44.115 --> 14:46.515
Good morning,
senhora...

14:46.515 --> 14:50.595
or not.

14:50.635 --> 14:54.635
Thank you.

14:54.635 --> 14:59.915
Thank you
very much.

14:59.955 --> 15:03.275
Thank you.

15:03.755 --> 15:05.195
I'm sorry. I don't
understand any-

15:05.235 --> 15:06.115
oh, forgive me.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.035
You don't speak
Portuguese.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.995
Only enough
to get my face slapped.

15:10.035 --> 15:12.155
I'm your neighbor.
Eduardo Marques.

15:12.195 --> 15:14.315
Victor Lyons.
Nice to meet you.

15:14.355 --> 15:15.715
Does she ever speak?

15:15.755 --> 15:17.675
Never.
It is a blessing.

15:17.715 --> 15:19.835
How about
some coffee?

15:19.875 --> 15:21.955
I will.
Thank you.

15:21.995 --> 15:23.875
You are here
with your family?

15:23.915 --> 15:26.315
My friend and I.
And our daughters.

15:26.315 --> 15:27.715
And your wives

15:27.755 --> 15:29.195
I'm split up with mine.

15:29.195 --> 15:30.595
Sorry.

15:30.635 --> 15:32.035
Uh, should i
be sorry?

15:32.035 --> 15:34.915
It isn't final yet.
We're in the process.

15:34.955 --> 15:36.995
She wants
a june divorce.

15:37.035 --> 15:38.515
She's very sentimental.

15:38.555 --> 15:39.995
Do you miss me
at all?

15:40.035 --> 15:40.955
At all?

15:40.955 --> 15:42.875
Yes, dear,
I miss you at all.

15:42.915 --> 15:43.995
How much is that?

15:44.035 --> 15:47.195
How's Nicky,
Jennifer?

15:47.235 --> 15:48.595
They're fine.

15:48.635 --> 15:49.595
What are
you doing there?

15:49.635 --> 15:51.075
Nothing.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.435
It's lovely.

15:52.475 --> 15:53.875
Can you take
a month of that?

15:53.915 --> 15:56.275
It'll give me
a good chance to think

15:56.315 --> 15:58.715
now, what's all this thinking
that you have to do?

15:58.755 --> 16:00.875
I don't want to
shock you, Matthew

16:00.915 --> 16:03.035
but I have been thinking
for years.

16:03.075 --> 16:04.435
We miss you here.

16:04.475 --> 16:05.395
The girls.
Victor, too.

16:05.435 --> 16:09.275
Tell Victor to play
with his settlement papers

16:09.315 --> 16:11.155
I miss you,
Karen.

16:11.195 --> 16:14.555
A lot more
than "at all."

16:14.555 --> 16:16.955
Take care, Matthew

16:16.955 --> 16:19.835
you, too.

16:19.875 --> 16:22.675
Matthew!

16:22.675 --> 16:24.115
This is our
neighbor.

16:24.155 --> 16:25.555
Uh, Eduardo
Marques.

16:25.595 --> 16:27.435
Marques.

16:27.475 --> 16:28.915
This is
Matthew
Hollish.

16:28.955 --> 16:29.835
Hollis.

16:29.875 --> 16:31.315
Eduardo owns
a restaurant.

16:31.355 --> 16:32.875
I said
we'll try it.

16:32.875 --> 16:34.275
You ok

16:34.315 --> 16:36.435
yeah. I just
spoke to Karen.

16:36.475 --> 16:38.515
Everything,
uh, all right?

16:38.555 --> 16:40.515
I guess so.
She seems fine.

16:40.515 --> 16:42.435
What the hell's
she doing there?

16:42.475 --> 16:44.795
Thinking.

16:44.835 --> 16:48.675
That's exactly
how I lost my wife.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.275
Uh, no offense.

16:50.315 --> 16:51.515
Thinking about what?

16:51.555 --> 16:52.755
What's there
to think about

16:52.795 --> 16:55.195
listen, we came here
for a good time.

16:55.235 --> 16:56.035
Let's have
a good time.

16:56.075 --> 16:57.515
I'm gonna forget
about your wife.

16:57.555 --> 16:58.915
I'm gonna forget
about my wife.

16:58.955 --> 17:02.795
And you can forget
about my wife, if you like.

17:02.795 --> 17:03.755
What do you say,
Matthew?

17:03.755 --> 17:05.155
I'll try.

17:05.194 --> 17:06.115
What do you mean,
you'll try?

17:06.155 --> 17:11.035
This is all your idea.
This is Rio, remember?

17:44.995 --> 17:49.275
I don't know if I can take
a week of this.

17:49.315 --> 17:50.275
Matthew!

17:50.315 --> 17:51.195
Victor!

17:51.195 --> 17:52.635
Hello, Peter.
Helaine.

17:52.675 --> 17:54.115
What a nice
surprise.

17:54.155 --> 17:55.315
Where are
you staying?

17:55.355 --> 17:56.475
We're at
the Verde Oro.

17:56.515 --> 17:58.355
The Oro Verde.

17:58.395 --> 17:59.835
We've got
a house.

17:59.875 --> 18:01.235
Oh. Lovely.

18:01.275 --> 18:02.235
We'll give you
a call.

18:02.275 --> 18:03.915
Do.

18:03.955 --> 18:05.555
Yes.

18:05.595 --> 18:07.555
I've always had
a feeling about her.

18:07.595 --> 18:09.515
You've got a feeling
about everybody.

18:09.555 --> 18:11.475
I didn't know
they were back together.

18:11.475 --> 18:13.315
He had a thing
with his secretary.

18:13.355 --> 18:18.635
Iooks like he brought
his thing back home.

18:40.315 --> 18:41.715
They smiled.

18:41.755 --> 18:43.195
Maybe we should
talk to them.

18:43.235 --> 18:44.115
We can't.

18:44.155 --> 18:45.555
They're
practically naked.

18:45.595 --> 18:50.275
Try to picture them
with clothes on.

18:53.155 --> 18:59.355
I hope I don't
step on anything.

18:59.395 --> 19:01.795
I've always had a problem
handling nudity.

19:01.835 --> 19:03.475
I like it, mind you,

19:03.515 --> 19:05.555
but it is troubling.

19:05.555 --> 19:07.515
Anybody's. Even my own.

19:07.555 --> 19:09.955
Sometimes,
when I'm getting undressed,

19:09.995 --> 19:12.355
I almost wish
I could leave the room.

19:12.395 --> 19:15.715
You know what I mean?

19:19.715 --> 19:22.955
This place
can make you crazy.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.275
I think the monkey
likes you.

19:25.315 --> 19:27.595
Hey,
those are the girls.

19:27.635 --> 19:34.755
Hi!

19:34.795 --> 19:37.675
Isn't it
a fabulous day?

19:37.715 --> 19:38.595
Fabulous.

19:38.635 --> 19:41.035
Aren't you a little
chilly, Jennifer?

19:41.035 --> 19:41.995
Chilly?

19:42.035 --> 19:42.915
I am.

19:42.955 --> 19:44.875
I feel
a little chill

19:44.875 --> 19:45.795
no, really

19:45.835 --> 19:47.275
why don't
we all get dressed

19:47.275 --> 19:48.475
and go in
for a swim?

19:48.515 --> 19:49.635
You're embarrassed.

19:49.635 --> 19:52.235
No, I'm not
embarrassed.

19:52.275 --> 19:54.835
Oh, daddy.
Help me, Nicky.

19:54.875 --> 19:56.995
Come on, come on. Hey!

19:57.035 --> 19:59.115
Come on,
don't push me.

19:59.155 --> 20:02.995
Hey, what are
you looking at? Hey!

20:03.035 --> 20:04.435
Come on. Stop.
Whoa!

20:04.475 --> 20:06.035
Aah!

20:06.035 --> 20:08.555
Come on in,
uncle Matthew!

20:08.595 --> 20:10.435
Poor uncle Matthew.

20:10.475 --> 20:13.355
I don't know why
some people can't get older

20:13.355 --> 20:15.275
without getting old.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.195
Didn't dry
your hair.

20:17.195 --> 20:18.595
It'll dry.

20:18.635 --> 20:19.555
Sure, it will,
but if you dry it,

20:19.595 --> 20:20.515
you won't have to wait
for it to dry.

20:20.555 --> 20:21.475
Where's your towel?

20:21.475 --> 20:22.675
I don't need it.
Daddy.

20:22.715 --> 20:23.875
You need a cold,
right?

20:23.915 --> 20:24.355
Ow.

20:24.355 --> 20:25.315
Don't "ow" me.

20:25.315 --> 20:28.875
You catch a cold,
your mother's lawyers

20:28.915 --> 20:32.435
will turn it into
double pneumonia.

20:32.475 --> 20:33.355
Hey!

20:33.395 --> 20:36.275
Let's take some time out

20:36.315 --> 20:38.155
time out

20:38.195 --> 20:40.635
party time is waiting...?

20:40.675 --> 20:43.075
Hurry up, daddy.
Catch them.

20:43.115 --> 20:44.035
What's wrong?

20:44.075 --> 20:44.955
Follow them!

20:44.995 --> 20:45.955
Let's see them
get married.

20:45.995 --> 20:46.915
We don't
even know them.

20:46.955 --> 20:47.875
So? That doesn't
matter.

20:47.915 --> 20:48.795
It's Brazilian.

20:48.835 --> 20:51.715
It's a different
kind of wedding.

20:51.755 --> 20:54.595
I'll wait
and catch the divorce.

21:07.995 --> 21:09.435
Come on, Nicky!

21:09.475 --> 21:10.835
What about dinner?

21:10.875 --> 21:11.835
They'll have
lots of food.

21:11.875 --> 21:13.075
Remember, 1:00!

21:13.075 --> 21:14.195
2:00
the latest!

21:14.235 --> 21:15.675
They'll be
all right.

21:15.715 --> 21:17.115
They're good girls.

21:17.155 --> 21:18.035
Yeah.

21:18.075 --> 21:23.915
Let's go find
some bad ones.

21:50.795 --> 21:52.675
They're alone.

21:52.715 --> 21:55.115
There's probably
a reason.

21:55.115 --> 21:57.475
They keep
looking over at me.

21:57.515 --> 21:59.395
Maybe
they're lawyers.

21:59.435 --> 22:01.115
My luck...

22:01.155 --> 22:02.715
waiter.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.155
What are you doing?

22:04.195 --> 22:07.515
I'm gonna send them
a drink.

22:07.555 --> 22:09.955
Think they'll be easier
to get than the waiter

22:09.995 --> 22:12.355
uh, Victor, let's not
start something here.

22:12.395 --> 22:13.275
A drink is fine,

22:13.315 --> 22:15.715
but after that,
you're on your own.

22:15.755 --> 22:17.635
I didn't come to Rio
to cheat.

22:17.675 --> 22:19.555
Don't ever
use that word.

22:19.595 --> 22:20.475
Is tasting life,

22:20.515 --> 22:22.435
creating
a little magic-

22:22.475 --> 22:25.275
is that
cheating?

22:25.315 --> 22:27.195
We're a long time
dead.

22:27.235 --> 22:29.635
And being unfaithful
will get me that way fast.

22:29.635 --> 22:31.075
You're faithful
out of fear,

22:31.075 --> 22:31.995
is that it

22:32.035 --> 22:33.475
maybe out of fear,
maybe out of habit,

22:33.475 --> 22:34.875
but it's been so long,

22:34.915 --> 22:39.395
I'm definitely
out of practice.

22:39.435 --> 22:41.475
Iook at that.

22:41.515 --> 22:42.955
The one
with the cigar

22:42.995 --> 22:43.875
you like that?

22:43.915 --> 22:48.715
That lady
is my kinda guy.

22:48.755 --> 22:53.035
Don't wait up.

22:57.355 --> 22:58.795
Reckless, impulsive,

22:58.795 --> 23:00.475
unthinking...

23:00.515 --> 23:02.115
not Victor. Me...

23:02.115 --> 23:05.475
as I was about to find out.

23:20.075 --> 23:23.915
I'm on
the groom's side.

23:49.395 --> 23:51.315
Hi, uncle Matthew!

23:51.355 --> 23:54.955
Hi!

23:54.995 --> 23:58.475
Nicky!

23:58.515 --> 23:59.915
Where's daddy?

23:59.955 --> 24:01.675
Uh, he's-he's not here.

24:01.715 --> 24:03.515
He's, uh, making a friend.

24:03.555 --> 24:05.315
That's my dad.
Want to dance?

24:05.315 --> 24:07.235
No, thank you.
It's not my kind of music.

24:07.275 --> 24:08.675
But listening is fine.

24:08.675 --> 24:10.075
Aw, come on.
The beat's wonderful.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.035
No, it's just that I can't
do any kind of dancing

24:12.075 --> 24:13.475
where you have to use
your body.

24:13.515 --> 24:14.395
I'll wait here.

24:14.435 --> 24:16.355
No, you've got to see
the newlyweds.

24:16.395 --> 24:19.515
Her mother's
a macumba lady.

24:19.555 --> 24:22.395
May I kiss the bride

24:22.435 --> 24:25.275
no.

24:30.275 --> 24:32.675
She says if anyone
deserves a kiss, it's her,

24:32.715 --> 24:34.075
because her prayers

24:34.115 --> 24:37.955
are responsible
for this marriage.

25:52.475 --> 25:53.395
Let's go in.

25:53.435 --> 25:55.315
Go in.
Are you kidding?

25:55.315 --> 25:59.155
I bet that water's
freezing.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.595
This is crazy.

26:04.635 --> 26:05.915
Crazy's wonderful.

26:05.955 --> 26:07.195
Crazy's the best.

26:07.235 --> 26:10.955
I'm too old for crazy.
Can't we settle for silly?

26:10.995 --> 26:12.195
It's too cold!

26:12.235 --> 26:13.315
No, it's not.

26:13.355 --> 26:17.195
It's not too cold,
and you're not too old

26:22.475 --> 26:23.395
it's-it's warmer

26:23.435 --> 26:27.755
than I thought
it was going to be

26:42.155 --> 26:45.595
uh...

26:48.955 --> 26:51.115
Jennifer!

26:51.155 --> 26:54.595
Jennifer.

26:54.635 --> 26:58.075
Jennifer!

27:10.995 --> 27:14.355
Jennifer...

27:17.315 --> 27:19.955
Iook!

27:19.995 --> 27:22.595
A shell.

27:36.995 --> 27:40.315
Make love to me.

27:40.355 --> 27:42.755
I'm 20 years older
than you.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.155
28.

27:45.195 --> 27:47.555
25.

27:58.275 --> 28:00.155
I was wrong.

28:00.195 --> 28:04.515
You're never too old
to be crazy.

28:28.475 --> 28:29.915
I loved that ceremony.

28:29.955 --> 28:30.875
I'm so glad

28:30.875 --> 28:33.275
I thought it was super,

28:33.275 --> 28:35.675
much better than
the royal wedding.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.075
Definitely.

28:37.115 --> 28:39.035
I think we're having
just about the best holiday

28:39.075 --> 28:39.955
we've ever had.

28:39.995 --> 28:42.355
I think
I love this place.

28:42.395 --> 28:43.835
It's so different
from brighton.

28:43.875 --> 28:45.235
Oh, look at these rocks.

28:45.275 --> 28:46.715
Talking about brighton,
look at these rocks.

28:46.755 --> 28:47.915
Oh, yes,

28:47.955 --> 28:51.315
they're extremely
craggy, aren't they?

28:51.355 --> 28:53.635
This
is
a craggy place.

28:53.675 --> 28:55.355
It is. Matthew!
Is that you?

28:55.395 --> 28:57.675
That's right.
This is me.

28:57.715 --> 28:59.555
I- it's Peter
and helaine.

28:59.595 --> 29:01.395
Yes, yes. Of course.
I know.

29:01.435 --> 29:02.595
Are you all right?

29:02.635 --> 29:04.555
Yes, I'm fine,
thank you.

29:04.595 --> 29:07.315
How are you?

29:07.315 --> 29:08.635
Here for the month

29:08.675 --> 29:10.675
uh, what month
is that?

29:10.715 --> 29:11.635
This month.

29:11.635 --> 29:13.515
Oh. Oh, this month.
Yes, yes.

29:13.555 --> 29:15.955
This is the month
that I'm here for.

29:15.995 --> 29:18.275
We were just
at the ceremony.

29:18.315 --> 29:19.755
Delightful,
wasn't it?

29:19.795 --> 29:21.915
Is that, uh,
Karen over there?

29:21.955 --> 29:23.035
No.

29:23.075 --> 29:24.395
That's not Karen.
Karen couldn't come.

29:24.435 --> 29:25.875
She's dead.

29:25.875 --> 29:27.235
Not really.

29:27.275 --> 29:29.155
No, no.
She's not really dead.

29:29.195 --> 29:31.595
Not in the sense
that she's not alive.

29:31.635 --> 29:33.955
Matthew,
you are all right?

29:33.995 --> 29:35.915
Yeah. Yes, I'm fine.
Fine, thank you.

29:35.955 --> 29:37.875
I- I just came out
for a walk.

29:37.915 --> 29:40.315
A- and to bury yourself
in the sand?

29:40.355 --> 29:42.035
Yeah. Ha.
Yes, I did, didn't I?

29:42.035 --> 29:44.195
Well, do give us a call
if you like.

29:44.235 --> 29:46.355
Yeah, we're at the,
uh, Verde Oro.

29:46.395 --> 29:48.155
Oro Verde, dear.

29:48.195 --> 29:49.915
Yes. Yes, of course.

29:49.955 --> 29:52.635
Wherever. Ha.

29:52.635 --> 29:55.275
God bless.

30:00.075 --> 30:02.235
Jennifer, wake up.

30:02.275 --> 30:04.515
Wake up, Jennifer.

30:04.555 --> 30:06.755
You fell asleep.

30:06.795 --> 30:08.515
You've been
dreaming.

30:08.555 --> 30:10.355
You had
a very bad dream.

30:10.395 --> 30:12.115
That we were making love.

30:12.155 --> 30:14.555
Probably. Yes.
Probably that was it.

30:14.595 --> 30:15.995
How would you know?

30:16.035 --> 30:16.915
Uh...

30:16.955 --> 30:20.795
i- I must've had
the same dream, too.

30:20.875 --> 30:22.195
Don't feel guilty.

30:22.235 --> 30:26.595
I don't know
what to feel.

30:26.635 --> 30:31.555
I'm ready for another
dream if you are.

30:35.475 --> 30:39.275
Mmm.

30:39.315 --> 30:40.515
Excellent.

30:40.555 --> 30:41.675
My ex-husband,

30:41.715 --> 30:44.955
he hated
the smell of cigars.

30:44.995 --> 30:48.235
My wife couldn't
stand them.

30:48.275 --> 30:50.595
So, uh...

30:50.635 --> 30:52.555
how long have you and your
husband been split up?

30:52.555 --> 30:54.435
12 days.

30:54.475 --> 30:56.355
Can I tell you
something?

30:56.395 --> 30:59.715
You are my 12th lover
in 12 days.

30:59.755 --> 31:00.675
Really?

31:00.675 --> 31:03.555
I don't hurt
your feelings?

31:03.555 --> 31:07.395
Nah. I've always been
a team player.

31:10.755 --> 31:12.195
It is better
making love to someone

31:12.235 --> 31:15.155
when you're not married.

31:15.155 --> 31:16.595
Let's you be
a little kinky.

31:16.635 --> 31:17.555
What is kinky?

31:17.555 --> 31:19.955
I'll show you
in a minute...

31:19.995 --> 31:20.915
well, or 2.

31:20.915 --> 31:25.755
Those are the guys I knew
were standing in line

31:25.795 --> 31:30.635
who would've guessed
that she was already mine?

31:30.635 --> 31:32.515
Though I don't dance

31:32.515 --> 31:36.835
and heaven knows
I'm not that bright

31:36.875 --> 31:41.155
but still
I'm doing something right

31:41.195 --> 31:43.035
yeah, baby?

31:43.075 --> 31:49.475
Ba dap bap buh dappa dap?

31:49.515 --> 31:51.515
Jennifer. You're up.
Did I wake you?

31:51.555 --> 31:53.355
I had to do something.

31:53.395 --> 31:54.755
You're not sick,
are you?

31:54.795 --> 31:56.195
What is it,
your stomach?

31:56.195 --> 31:57.515
Did you eat something?

31:57.555 --> 31:58.755
You caught a cold,
didn't you?

31:58.795 --> 32:00.835
I told you
your hair was wet.

32:00.835 --> 32:02.835
Daddy, did you have
a good time?

32:02.875 --> 32:04.035
Fair.

32:04.075 --> 32:05.155
You?

32:05.195 --> 32:06.155
Fair.

32:06.195 --> 32:07.635
Well, good night,
sweetheart.

32:07.675 --> 32:10.955
Good night.

32:10.995 --> 32:13.875
Why in the world
she chose me

32:13.915 --> 32:16.635
I'll never know

32:16.635 --> 32:19.035
now every guy
who knows me

32:19.075 --> 32:21.795
envies me so...?

32:21.835 --> 32:24.235
I'll never forget
the way he felt.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.635
The way
we felt.

32:25.675 --> 32:27.115
Nothing's perfect, though.

32:27.155 --> 32:28.515
It'll take a month

32:28.555 --> 32:33.835
To get all the sand
Out of my bellybutton.

32:33.835 --> 32:37.155
3!

32:37.155 --> 32:39.075
Ready to hear
about last night?

32:39.115 --> 32:40.035
50.

32:40.035 --> 32:41.915
First of all,
her name is isabella,

32:41.955 --> 32:44.355
which has to be portuguese
for "perpetual motion."

32:44.395 --> 32:46.315
It was fantastic.

32:46.315 --> 32:48.155
Where'd you wind up?

32:48.195 --> 32:51.155
Aha. You got milk all over
your whiskers, pussycat.

32:51.195 --> 32:53.555
Who was the lucky girl?
Where'd you meet her?

32:53.595 --> 32:54.995
I didn't meet anybody.

32:54.995 --> 32:56.435
Ok, ok.
We'll talk at breakfast.

32:56.435 --> 32:59.795
I want to know
all the details about her.

32:59.835 --> 33:03.155
You can start at the bottom
if you like.

33:06.035 --> 33:09.475
So did you kids have fun
at the wedding?

33:09.515 --> 33:12.955
Oh, yeah. Us kids had fun
at the wedding.

33:12.995 --> 33:13.875
Ow!

33:13.915 --> 33:14.875
Let me kiss it.

33:14.915 --> 33:15.795
Are you crazy?

33:15.835 --> 33:17.755
They're outside
having breakfast.

33:17.755 --> 33:21.595
Kiss me.

33:24.435 --> 33:25.395
Jennifer,
about last night-

33:25.435 --> 33:26.355
kiss me first.

33:26.355 --> 33:27.555
Kiss you?
I ought to spank you.

33:27.595 --> 33:28.755
Oh, please,
and bite me, too.

33:28.795 --> 33:31.115
Now stop that.

33:31.155 --> 33:32.795
Did you get
my sand flower?

33:32.835 --> 33:34.075
Oh, was that yours?
I did.

33:34.075 --> 33:35.275
It was lovely.
Thank you.

33:35.315 --> 33:36.275
You're lovely.

33:36.315 --> 33:37.155
No, I'm not.

33:37.195 --> 33:38.395
You're a fantastic lover.

33:38.435 --> 33:39.555
Don't talk
like that.

33:39.595 --> 33:41.475
Why? Will you tell
my father on me?

33:41.515 --> 33:43.915
There's nothing to tell.
Last night never happened.

33:43.955 --> 33:45.795
I know. I was there
when it didn't.

33:45.835 --> 33:48.475
No, I mean it.
It was just one wild moment.

33:48.515 --> 33:51.115
That's all it was.
You've got to forget it.

33:51.155 --> 33:52.555
We've both got to forget it.

33:52.595 --> 33:53.955
I was just
a one-night stand?

33:53.995 --> 33:57.355
No, no, no, no.
You're more than that.

33:57.395 --> 33:58.755
Am I?

33:58.795 --> 34:00.235
Jennifer, don't.

34:00.275 --> 34:02.395
What's the matter?

34:02.435 --> 34:04.195
You're too next to me.

34:04.235 --> 34:05.995
You want me to go?

34:05.995 --> 34:07.395
You'd better.

34:07.435 --> 34:11.715
One kiss,
and I will.

34:11.755 --> 34:14.635
All right.

34:14.675 --> 34:17.475
A little one.

34:27.635 --> 34:29.554
Good morning, daddy.

34:29.554 --> 34:31.955
What happened to my coffee
in bed this morning?

34:31.995 --> 34:33.355
I forgot.

34:33.395 --> 34:35.795
We're here one night,
and already I've lost you.

34:35.835 --> 34:39.155
Maybe you've
gained a son.

34:39.195 --> 34:40.554
What does that mean?

34:40.594 --> 34:42.034
Should I know
what that means?

34:42.074 --> 34:43.475
That's just Nicky.

34:43.514 --> 34:44.915
"Just Nicky" what?

34:44.955 --> 34:46.435
Being Nicky.

34:46.435 --> 34:50.755
What's on your face?

34:50.795 --> 34:55.034
Whipped cream.

34:55.074 --> 34:57.235
Tell me the truth,
Jennifer.

34:57.275 --> 34:59.355
Are you having fun so far?

34:59.395 --> 35:03.715
I want this to be the best
time we ever had together.

35:03.755 --> 35:04.635
I love you no matter

35:04.675 --> 35:07.075
what rotten things
your mother says about me.

35:07.115 --> 35:08.995
She doesn't say
anything bad about you

35:09.035 --> 35:10.875
yeah, but you can't
always believe her.

35:10.915 --> 35:14.075
Hey, not too many grapes.
They're hard to digest.

35:14.115 --> 35:15.515
Good morning, everyone.

35:15.555 --> 35:17.915
Sleep well,
uncle Matthew?

35:17.955 --> 35:20.315
Yes, I slept fine,
thank you.

35:20.355 --> 35:21.235
Hey, another egg.

35:21.275 --> 35:23.675
We really struck fertility
around here.

35:23.715 --> 35:25.795
Must be something
in the water.

35:25.835 --> 35:27.555
Nicky tells me
the wedding was fun.

35:27.595 --> 35:29.315
It seemed all right
the few minutes I-

35:29.355 --> 35:31.675
I was there.

35:31.715 --> 35:33.115
You meet any nice boys?

35:33.155 --> 35:35.355
I wasn't there
long enough.

35:35.395 --> 35:37.075
I asked Jennifer.

35:37.115 --> 35:38.595
Eh?

35:38.635 --> 35:40.035
Oh.

35:40.075 --> 35:41.875
One. One nice boy.

35:41.915 --> 35:47.715
Ah, terrific.

35:47.715 --> 35:50.075
What the hell's
the matter with you?

35:50.115 --> 35:52.435
I'm sorry. I'm just
a little jumpy.

35:52.475 --> 35:54.275
What are you jumpy about?

35:54.275 --> 35:55.675
I don't know.

35:55.675 --> 35:57.115
I didn't sleep
very well.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.075
You said
you slept fine.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.915
Then that must be it.

36:00.955 --> 36:02.875
You started smoking
again, too.

36:02.915 --> 36:07.675
Me? No.

36:16.115 --> 36:18.515
I think I'll make
a fresh watercress salad

36:18.555 --> 36:19.955
pick me out a couple
of nice bunches.

36:19.995 --> 36:20.915
No droopy ones

36:20.955 --> 36:21.835
right.

36:21.875 --> 36:23.315
You sure you won't
change your mind

36:23.355 --> 36:24.275
about after dinner

36:24.315 --> 36:25.675
I'm sure.

36:25.715 --> 36:28.115
Isabella's friend's just
been separated, too.

36:28.155 --> 36:29.995
You can't miss

36:30.035 --> 36:31.955
Victor, I am not
looking not to miss.

36:31.995 --> 36:33.395
You know what these are?

36:33.435 --> 36:34.315
Fruta de caja.

36:34.355 --> 36:35.795
Supposed to be
an aphrodisiac.

36:35.835 --> 36:36.995
It's all in the mind.

36:37.035 --> 36:38.195
Want to find out?

36:38.195 --> 36:39.595
No, thanks

36:39.635 --> 36:42.035
you're not seeing that little
lady from last night again?

36:42.035 --> 36:43.435
No, no, no

36:43.435 --> 36:45.355
I won't be seeing
Karen for a month.

36:45.395 --> 36:47.275
Just eat one
and put yourself on hold.

36:47.315 --> 36:48.235
Hello, hello.

36:48.275 --> 36:49.635
Hi.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.115
How nice. You are buying
groceries together.

36:51.155 --> 36:53.435
You are, how you say,
the queer couple?

36:53.475 --> 36:55.315
Odd couple, odd.

36:55.355 --> 36:58.235
Yes. May I present
senhor Hollis,

36:58.275 --> 36:59.555
senhor Lyons.

36:59.595 --> 37:00.475
Hello.

37:00.515 --> 37:01.435
Shopping for
the restaurant?

37:01.475 --> 37:03.875
No. Just a few things
for myself.

37:03.915 --> 37:06.715
Good day, my friends.

37:06.755 --> 37:11.835
I wonder if you
can freeze these.

37:17.195 --> 37:19.115
I love doing this.

37:19.115 --> 37:21.515
I haven't fixed dinner
for Jennifer in years.

37:21.555 --> 37:22.915
Hmm?

37:22.955 --> 37:25.355
Gonna put some meat
on her bones this trip

37:25.395 --> 37:27.275
I think she's too thin,
don't you?

37:27.315 --> 37:28.675
What?

37:28.715 --> 37:31.595
Don't you think
Jennifer's too skinny?

37:31.635 --> 37:33.955
She looks just fine to me.

37:33.995 --> 37:38.395
You think maybe that's
why Karen backed out,

37:38.435 --> 37:39.315
so you and Nicky

37:39.355 --> 37:40.795
could spend
some time together

37:40.835 --> 37:43.395
I don't think so.

37:43.435 --> 37:46.635
I don't know.

37:46.675 --> 37:49.795
Maybe, huh?

37:49.835 --> 37:54.115
I bet a son's easier.

37:54.155 --> 37:56.035
Do you really know what's
going on with Nicky?

37:56.075 --> 37:57.955
I mean, like, with boys.

37:57.955 --> 38:00.355
She did ask permission
to go on the pill.

38:00.395 --> 38:02.755
Oh, yeah?
What did you say?

38:02.795 --> 38:04.155
We said yes.

38:04.195 --> 38:07.075
Think of the possible
consequences otherwise.

38:07.115 --> 38:09.155
Not me

38:09.195 --> 38:11.155
what?

38:11.195 --> 38:14.355
I said no.

38:14.395 --> 38:15.795
No?

38:15.795 --> 38:18.195
Jennifer asked me
last summer.

38:18.235 --> 38:20.595
She asked you
about the pill?

38:20.635 --> 38:21.515
Right.

38:21.555 --> 38:23.435
And you said no?

38:23.475 --> 38:25.395
I told her
it's up to her

38:25.435 --> 38:27.315
whether she
takes it or not.

38:27.355 --> 38:29.795
Oh, I see.

38:29.795 --> 38:33.155
If she does, it's
without my blessing.

38:33.195 --> 38:35.555
All I care
is that she tell me.

38:35.595 --> 38:37.915
Tell you what?

38:37.955 --> 38:41.515
Well, we have a pact.

38:41.555 --> 38:42.435
Pact?

38:42.475 --> 38:44.355
What sort of pact?

38:44.395 --> 38:46.755
Well, if she and some boy
are at that point

38:46.795 --> 38:50.155
in their relationship where
they're gonna-you know-

38:50.195 --> 38:51.595
she's gonna tell me first.

38:51.635 --> 38:52.515
First?

38:52.555 --> 38:53.475
Well, before, really.

38:53.515 --> 38:55.915
How the hell
is she gonna do that?

38:55.915 --> 38:58.315
She'll give me a call.

38:58.355 --> 39:00.675
You're not serious

39:00.675 --> 39:02.355
you don't really think
she's gonna stop

39:02.395 --> 39:04.035
right in the middle
of whatever it is

39:04.075 --> 39:05.675
they're doing
and give you a call?

39:05.715 --> 39:06.875
Not in the middle.
Before.

39:06.915 --> 39:12.395
But suppose there's
no phone on the beach.

39:12.435 --> 39:13.915
What beach?

39:13.915 --> 39:15.315
Any beach.

39:15.355 --> 39:17.275
If, by chance,
it happened on a beach

39:17.315 --> 39:18.995
happens
on a beach

39:18.995 --> 39:22.835
and I don't say
that it did or will.

39:22.875 --> 39:24.075
Hey.

39:24.115 --> 39:25.195
What?

39:25.235 --> 39:27.115
We made a pact.

39:27.155 --> 39:34.435
I trust her
not to break it.

39:44.235 --> 39:45.675
What's all this?

39:45.715 --> 39:47.355
Surprised?

39:47.395 --> 39:48.675
Fantastic.

39:48.715 --> 39:49.955
So romantic.

39:49.995 --> 39:52.395
No, it's not.
We're just loving fathers.

39:52.435 --> 39:54.275
I love
loving fathers.

39:54.315 --> 39:55.755
Ah, good evening,
mademoiselle.

39:55.795 --> 39:56.675
Dinner is served.

39:56.715 --> 39:58.395
Oh, I don't
want any.

39:58.395 --> 40:00.035
It's chateaubriand

40:00.075 --> 40:01.995
no steak for me.
I'm a vegetarian.

40:01.995 --> 40:02.795
Since when?

40:02.835 --> 40:04.235
I am no longer
a carnivore.

40:04.275 --> 40:06.195
I don't eat anything
that's ever had parents.

40:06.235 --> 40:08.595
We have artichokes.
They're orphans.

40:08.635 --> 40:10.275
Where are you going?

40:10.315 --> 40:11.955
Out. I need
my sweater.

40:11.995 --> 40:12.915
With him?

40:12.955 --> 40:13.835
Yes.

40:13.875 --> 40:15.315
What's his name?

40:15.355 --> 40:16.235
Diego.

40:16.275 --> 40:17.235
You're not going
anywhere

40:17.275 --> 40:21.475
till I meet him.

40:21.475 --> 40:25.635
You, come here.

40:25.675 --> 40:28.555
Diego,
this is my father.

40:28.555 --> 40:29.515
Does he speak?

40:29.555 --> 40:30.435
He's a drummer.

40:30.475 --> 40:32.875
Can he beat out hello
on the table?

40:32.875 --> 40:34.795
Daddy,
he's an artist.

40:34.835 --> 40:36.675
He's also
a carnivore.

40:36.715 --> 40:42.395
Come on.

40:42.435 --> 40:48.115
Good. I have you both
to myself.

40:52.595 --> 40:54.515
Whisper low

40:54.555 --> 40:56.435
how you feel

40:56.435 --> 41:00.275
let your eyes
speak your mind

41:00.315 --> 41:02.675
search your heart

41:02.715 --> 41:04.075
am I right?

41:04.115 --> 41:07.955
Is it love
that you find?

41:08.035 --> 41:11.875
Did you know
it could be

41:11.915 --> 41:17.435
a new world
in the making

41:17.435 --> 41:22.355
tonight alone with me?

41:22.395 --> 41:27.195
I could shout
how I feel

41:27.235 --> 41:31.355
but the truth
still must hide

41:31.395 --> 41:33.275
so for now...?

41:33.315 --> 41:35.635
To, uh...

41:35.675 --> 41:38.835
the 2 people
closest to my heart.

41:38.875 --> 41:41.155
2 people who make
me feel that, uh...

41:41.195 --> 41:43.435
well, I must be
worth something,

41:43.475 --> 41:45.635
because if
they love me,

41:45.675 --> 41:46.955
then i, uh

41:46.995 --> 41:48.395
can't be as
bad as someone

41:48.435 --> 41:50.835
who's the mother of
one of those 2 people

41:50.875 --> 41:52.235
thinks I am.

41:52.275 --> 41:54.515
Worthy or not,

41:54.555 --> 41:56.035
I love you both.

41:56.075 --> 41:57.555
I gotta run.

41:57.555 --> 41:58.275
Wait.

41:58.315 --> 41:59.635
I'm late already.

41:59.635 --> 42:01.675
You're not gonna leave
Jennifer here alone, are you?

42:01.715 --> 42:03.075
Why?

42:03.115 --> 42:04.075
You coming with me

42:04.075 --> 42:04.995
no.

42:05.035 --> 42:06.955
Well, then you'll
baby-sit.

42:06.955 --> 42:07.875
If she misbehaves,

42:07.915 --> 42:11.235
I want you to put her
over your knee, ok?

42:11.275 --> 42:12.195
Good night, sweetheart

42:12.195 --> 42:13.635
good night, daddy.
Have fun.

42:13.675 --> 42:17.475
Ok. You, too.

42:20.475 --> 42:22.875
There's nothing
to smile about.

42:22.875 --> 42:24.275
This will give us a chance

42:24.315 --> 42:28.595
to straighten this thing
between us out
once and for all.

42:28.635 --> 42:31.475
Jennifer.

42:31.475 --> 42:35.315
Are you listening to me?

42:41.355 --> 42:43.715
What?

42:43.755 --> 42:45.675
G
I was just
rememberin

42:45.715 --> 42:48.355
the first time
I kissed you.

42:48.355 --> 42:50.915
It was at your
christening.

42:50.955 --> 42:53.355
Your mother was
powdering your bottom,

42:53.395 --> 42:54.755
d
and I said I wante

42:54.795 --> 42:57.915
to be the first man
to kiss it.

42:57.955 --> 43:00.995
And I leaned over,
and I did.

43:01.035 --> 43:04.395
How dare you drive
a tiny baby wild with desire.

43:04.435 --> 43:05.795
Oops!

43:05.835 --> 43:07.275
They happen to use these
for birth control.

43:07.315 --> 43:13.955
Which one of us
wears it?

43:13.995 --> 43:20.675
I must be doing
something right

43:27.115 --> 43:29.995
you should wear
your hair like this.

43:30.035 --> 43:30.915
What time is it?

43:30.955 --> 43:34.315
About 1:00.
I like it like this.

43:34.355 --> 43:36.235
It makes you look older.

43:36.275 --> 43:37.915
It's almost 3:00.

43:37.955 --> 43:39.555
Pretend it's 1:00.

43:39.595 --> 43:41.035
We've done too much
pretending lately.

43:41.035 --> 43:42.715
You have to go

43:42.755 --> 43:44.355
let me stay.

43:44.395 --> 43:46.275
We don't have
to make love again.

43:46.315 --> 43:48.235
I promise not to
get you excited.

43:48.275 --> 43:50.115
I'll just bite
your neck a little.

43:50.155 --> 43:51.355
Jennifer.

43:51.395 --> 43:52.475
Meanie.

43:52.515 --> 43:55.395
I've never spent
the whole night

43:55.435 --> 43:57.275
Nicky must be
home by now.

43:57.315 --> 44:00.195
You always have to
worry about something.

44:00.235 --> 44:03.155
Your father told me
about your pact.

44:03.195 --> 44:06.035
Which pact?
My father just loves pacts.

44:06.035 --> 44:08.835
He said you'd tell him
that if you and a boy

44:08.875 --> 44:10.475
ever, um...

44:10.515 --> 44:12.075
"ever, um?"

44:12.075 --> 44:14.955
Do you think I'd "um"
with a boy?

44:14.995 --> 44:17.795
Do you think
I'm that kind of girl?

44:17.835 --> 44:20.235
I just promised daddy
to make him feel better.

44:20.275 --> 44:23.115
I never meant
to really tell him.

44:23.155 --> 44:24.035
You've got us
both wrapped

44:24.075 --> 44:26.475
round your little
finger, haven't you?

44:26.515 --> 44:27.875
I love you.

44:27.915 --> 44:30.795
I can't think of a time
when I ever didn't.

44:30.835 --> 44:33.635
Jennifer, it's late.

44:33.675 --> 44:36.555
I love it when
your glasses steam up.

44:36.595 --> 44:38.915
Only when I'm with you

44:38.955 --> 44:41.355
you know what I used to
pretend when I was little?

44:41.395 --> 44:43.515
I'm afraid to guess.

44:43.555 --> 44:45.675
That we were married.

44:45.675 --> 44:46.875
You and me

44:46.915 --> 44:48.675
when I was 10.

44:48.715 --> 44:50.435
And I was only 90.

44:50.435 --> 44:53.795
It would be lovely,
being married.

44:53.835 --> 44:55.715
Jennifer,
married people

44:55.715 --> 44:58.115
do not go around
getting married.

44:58.155 --> 45:01.475
Then maybe
just a honeymoon.

45:01.515 --> 45:04.755
Off you go

45:04.795 --> 45:07.955
off to bed

45:07.995 --> 45:09.435
it took whatever
strength I had

45:09.475 --> 45:11.315
to send her away.

45:11.355 --> 45:12.795
That's not
altogether true.

45:12.835 --> 45:14.195
If I really had
any strength,

45:14.235 --> 45:16.915
she never would've
been there at all.

45:16.955 --> 45:19.755
Jennifer.

45:19.795 --> 45:20.995
You all right?

45:21.035 --> 45:22.155
I'm fine, daddy.

45:22.195 --> 45:23.635
How come you're up
so late?

45:23.675 --> 45:26.035
How come you are?

45:26.075 --> 45:27.435
Touchi.

45:27.475 --> 45:28.915
Good night,
sweetheart

45:28.955 --> 45:30.835
good night, daddy.

45:30.875 --> 45:33.475
P- u!

45:33.515 --> 45:36.115
Cigar!

45:41.755 --> 45:43.275
Nicky,

45:43.315 --> 45:45.995
do you hate me?

45:46.035 --> 45:49.795
No

45:49.835 --> 45:53.515
him.

45:53.555 --> 45:55.555
Does he tell you
he loves you?

45:55.595 --> 45:58.035
No.

45:58.075 --> 46:01.915
You'll get used to it.

46:09.395 --> 46:11.595
If you want a man
to love you,

46:11.635 --> 46:13.755
you must light
many, many candles

46:13.795 --> 46:16.275
and give gifts
to the goddess iamanja.

46:16.315 --> 46:18.155
The goddess iamanja?

46:18.195 --> 46:20.115
Throw flowers into the sea.

46:20.155 --> 46:21.035
White ones.

46:21.075 --> 46:21.995
If they come back,

46:22.035 --> 46:23.915
it means she has
rejected them.

46:23.955 --> 46:27.795
If not, she has listened
to your prayer.

46:27.995 --> 46:28.955
I'll do it.

46:28.995 --> 46:29.875
And here...

46:29.915 --> 46:35.275
have him
wear this always.

47:02.315 --> 47:03.355
You love me!

47:03.395 --> 47:04.715
The flowers
didn't come back.

47:04.755 --> 47:05.635
You love me.

47:05.675 --> 47:07.355
I want to tell
the whole world!

47:07.395 --> 47:10.275
I'm so happy.
The flowers didn't come back.

47:10.315 --> 47:11.195
You love me!

47:11.235 --> 47:15.875
You love me!
You love me!

47:15.915 --> 47:20.555
Jennifer, for god's sake.

47:20.595 --> 47:22.915
Here.

47:22.955 --> 47:23.875
What's this?

47:23.915 --> 47:26.755
It means you're mine.

47:26.795 --> 47:28.675
You know what love
really is?

47:28.715 --> 47:31.555
It's like you swallowed
a great big secret.

47:31.595 --> 47:33.475
A warm,
wonderful secret

47:33.475 --> 47:35.155
that nobody else
knows about.

47:35.195 --> 47:36.835
And that's
how it should be.

47:36.875 --> 47:38.315
Other times, though,

47:38.355 --> 47:39.675
it's more like a song.

47:39.715 --> 47:42.115
A song you want to sing
at the top of your voice

47:42.155 --> 47:43.515
for everyone to hear.

47:43.555 --> 47:45.915
Uh, no, no, no.
It's more like a secret.

47:45.955 --> 47:48.835
Believe me, it is better
as a secret than a song.

47:48.875 --> 47:50.275
Matthew...

47:50.315 --> 47:52.155
yes?

47:52.195 --> 47:54.115
I've never called you
Matthew before.

47:54.155 --> 47:55.995
No uncle.

47:56.035 --> 47:59.835
Just plain Matthew

47:59.875 --> 48:02.275
do you love me,
Matthew?

48:02.315 --> 48:03.475
I do.

48:03.515 --> 48:04.675
Honestly?

48:04.675 --> 48:05.595
Yes.

48:05.635 --> 48:07.555
Secretly but honestly.

48:07.555 --> 48:09.435
No more secrets.

48:09.475 --> 48:10.875
You have t
o tell daddy

48:10.915 --> 48:12.355
I can't!
It would kill him

48:12.395 --> 48:13.755
if he didn't
kill me first.

48:13.755 --> 48:15.675
What's killing is
you can feel one way

48:15.715 --> 48:16.875
and love another.

48:16.875 --> 48:17.955
There is just no way

48:17.995 --> 48:19.915
we can bring this
out into the open.

48:19.955 --> 48:22.235
Who would understand?

48:22.275 --> 48:24.355
I'm not sure I do.

48:24.395 --> 48:26.435
It's over, Jennifer.

48:26.475 --> 48:27.835
It has to be.

48:27.875 --> 48:32.275
I won't let it be.

48:32.315 --> 48:36.675
Lunch, everyone!

48:36.675 --> 48:38.115
It was
just what I needed-

48:38.115 --> 48:42.715
a one-inch god
with a 2-inch penis.

48:57.515 --> 48:58.755
Aahhh!

48:58.795 --> 48:59.955
Ohhh!

48:59.995 --> 49:01.675
Are you all right?

49:01.715 --> 49:05.515
Somebody has put these
candles outside my-

49:05.555 --> 49:09.315
Jennifer, I don't know
what witchcraft

49:09.315 --> 49:10.715
brought us together,

49:10.755 --> 49:12.475
but it won't keep us
that way.

49:12.515 --> 49:14.555
Can't you give it
a little time?

49:14.595 --> 49:16.355
I'm lying to
enough people now.

49:16.395 --> 49:18.115
I don't want you
to be one of them.

49:18.155 --> 49:21.075
It's not easy
for me, either

49:21.115 --> 49:23.475
so, please, let us both
accept that it's over

49:23.515 --> 49:27.795
before you
set fire to me

49:27.835 --> 49:29.755
misunderstood

49:29.795 --> 49:31.595
we're hurtin'

49:31.635 --> 49:34.995
love was our crime

49:35.035 --> 49:37.675
fixed what we could

49:37.675 --> 49:40.275
but it takes time?

49:40.315 --> 49:43.795
Jennifer.

49:43.835 --> 49:47.235
What's wrong?

49:47.275 --> 49:48.715
Where are you going?

49:48.755 --> 49:50.595
Jennifer!

49:50.635 --> 49:55.715
For all the wounds heal

49:55.755 --> 50:00.835
when we just speak?

50:00.835 --> 50:05.875
Thank you
sweetheart.

50:05.915 --> 50:07.595
Hmm...

50:07.595 --> 50:09.035
r
why does coffee
always taste better

50:09.075 --> 50:11.075
when somebody else
makes it?

50:11.115 --> 50:12.915
Daddy...

50:12.915 --> 50:14.675
that's me.

50:14.715 --> 50:18.155
You always said we could
talk about anything.

50:18.195 --> 50:21.195
Anything
and everything

50:21.235 --> 50:24.195
what is it
is it a boy?

50:24.235 --> 50:26.755
Sort of.

50:26.795 --> 50:30.635
Hey, that's nothing
to cry about.

50:30.675 --> 50:33.995
I'm trying not to.

50:34.035 --> 50:35.395
Oh, daddy.

50:35.435 --> 50:36.875
Something happened

50:36.875 --> 50:38.315
something happened?

50:38.315 --> 50:39.715
With a boy?

50:39.755 --> 50:41.035
Sort of.

50:41.075 --> 50:43.075
What do you mean, sort of?

50:43.075 --> 50:46.435
Sort of a boy or something
sort of happened?

50:46.475 --> 50:49.635
What are you saying?

50:49.675 --> 50:51.635
More than sort of.

50:51.675 --> 50:54.915
How much more?

50:54.955 --> 50:58.115
I slept with him.

50:58.155 --> 51:00.555
You slept with someone?

51:00.595 --> 51:02.955
Why didn't you tell me?

51:02.995 --> 51:04.835
I just did

51:04.875 --> 51:05.795
now you tell me?

51:05.835 --> 51:07.235
What good does it
do me now?

51:07.275 --> 51:08.715
What good is it
supposed to do you

51:08.715 --> 51:10.595
Jennifer,
we had a pact.

51:10.635 --> 51:12.075
You were gonna
tell me first.

51:12.075 --> 51:14.475
At least call.

51:14.515 --> 51:16.835
I know, daddy.

51:17.235 --> 51:19.155
Don't cry. I'm sorry.
Please don't cry.

51:19.195 --> 51:21.075
I couldn't
call you first.

51:21.115 --> 51:23.715
He took you
by surprise?

51:23.755 --> 51:27.435
I didn't have
the money.

51:27.475 --> 51:31.155
You didn't have
the money.

51:31.155 --> 51:32.075
What about collect?

51:32.115 --> 51:34.035
You ever hear of
calling a person collect?

51:34.035 --> 51:36.795
We were on
the beach.

51:36.835 --> 51:38.195
On the beach.

51:38.235 --> 51:42.075
Is that where he, uh...
forced himself on you?

51:42.115 --> 51:45.275
I wanted him, daddy.

51:45.275 --> 51:48.395
Where on the beach?

51:48.435 --> 51:49.795
When?

51:49.835 --> 51:50.795
I want to know everything.

51:50.835 --> 51:53.475
The other night.

51:53.475 --> 51:55.755
After the wedding.

51:55.795 --> 51:57.995
There was a wedding?

51:58.035 --> 51:59.115
Whose wedding?

51:59.155 --> 52:02.275
Those people
the other night.

52:02.315 --> 52:05.395
Oh, those people's
wedding.

52:05.395 --> 52:06.835
There's something else.

52:06.835 --> 52:08.595
You're pregnant.

52:08.635 --> 52:09.835
Illegitimate pregnancy.

52:09.875 --> 52:12.275
It's something you think
only happens to the other guy.

52:12.315 --> 52:13.995
I'm not pregnant.

52:13.995 --> 52:15.595
I'm on the pill.

52:15.635 --> 52:17.355
I thought I told you
not to use the pill.

52:17.395 --> 52:21.515
Is that how you
listen to me?!

52:21.555 --> 52:25.595
Thank god you don't
listen to me.

52:25.595 --> 52:28.955
Well, look, what's
done is done, right?

52:28.995 --> 52:31.355
So, uh...

52:31.355 --> 52:33.035
tell me about him.

52:33.075 --> 52:34.675
What's his name?

52:34.715 --> 52:36.635
Who is he, um,
some kid like you

52:36.675 --> 52:38.075
just out of diapers?

52:38.115 --> 52:39.475
He's older

52:39.515 --> 52:41.195
oh, an older guy.

52:41.235 --> 52:42.875
What, 19, 20?

52:42.915 --> 52:44.795
Older.

52:44.835 --> 52:46.155
21?

52:46.195 --> 52:48.515
43.

52:48.555 --> 52:50.795
43!

52:50.835 --> 52:53.235
You made love
to a man of 43?

52:53.275 --> 52:55.115
It's not that old.

52:55.155 --> 52:57.515
It's obscene.
Believe me.

52:57.555 --> 52:59.955
I'm that old,
and it's obscene!

52:59.995 --> 53:01.395
It was beautiful!

53:01.435 --> 53:02.795
Oh, yeah?

53:02.835 --> 53:04.235
And now what...

53:04.275 --> 53:06.835
what's the next beautiful
thing that happens?

53:06.875 --> 53:07.675
Nothing.

53:07.715 --> 53:08.435
Really.

53:08.475 --> 53:10.395
You go right from
beautiful to nothing.

53:10.435 --> 53:11.435
Now why is that?

53:11.475 --> 53:12.875
Because he's married.

53:12.915 --> 53:15.275
Close, you bastard, close.

53:15.315 --> 53:16.235
He's married?

53:16.235 --> 53:17.675
I'll tell you
what else he is.

53:17.715 --> 53:18.635
He's dead!

53:18.635 --> 53:23.435
I love him, daddy!

53:25.275 --> 53:28.515
My poor baby.

53:32.555 --> 53:35.195
Just tell me
who he is.

53:35.235 --> 53:37.835
That's all I want to know.

53:38.035 --> 53:39.315
Who is he, Jennifer?

53:39.355 --> 53:44.635
It doesn't matter.
It's over.

53:44.675 --> 53:45.395
Matthew!

53:45.395 --> 53:46.035
What?

53:46.075 --> 53:47.035
Where are you going?

53:47.075 --> 53:47.995
Sao Paulo.

53:48.035 --> 53:48.635
Now?

53:48.675 --> 53:50.595
I- I have to.
Something came up.

53:50.635 --> 53:51.515
You can't.

53:51.555 --> 53:53.955
I'll be back,
but I have to go first.

53:53.995 --> 53:55.075
Matthew.

53:55.115 --> 53:56.115
I need you.

53:56.155 --> 53:58.035
I couldn't refuse.

53:58.075 --> 54:00.955
I- I was his best friend,
and he needed my help.

54:00.995 --> 54:02.355
My help.

54:02.395 --> 54:03.355
It was like
asking an arsonist

54:03.355 --> 54:04.675
to become the fire chief.

54:04.715 --> 54:07.355
It's my fault.

54:07.355 --> 54:09.915
The whole thing.

54:09.955 --> 54:11.835
If I'd been around more,

54:11.875 --> 54:14.755
if not for the divorce,
it never would've happened.

54:14.795 --> 54:16.635
The guy's a
father figure,

54:16.675 --> 54:18.595
it's classic. You know
what I'm talking about?

54:18.635 --> 54:19.515
Yeah.

54:19.555 --> 54:21.915
The kid's got
such good instincts.

54:21.955 --> 54:24.835
She feels she's gonna
protect the son of a bitch.

54:24.875 --> 54:26.755
Oh, I have to
admire that.

54:26.795 --> 54:27.675
Yeah.

54:27.715 --> 54:29.635
But I can't leave it
like this.

54:29.635 --> 54:32.475
I've gotta know
who he is.

54:32.515 --> 54:35.275
It's gotta be you,
Matthew.

54:35.315 --> 54:36.195
What?

54:36.235 --> 54:39.595
She loves you.
She trusts you.

54:39.635 --> 54:41.555
Take her out,
will ya?

54:41.595 --> 54:43.035
Maybe she'll
tell you something.

54:43.075 --> 54:44.435
This was it.

54:44.475 --> 54:46.355
The moment had come.

54:46.395 --> 54:48.315
I summoned all my courage.

54:48.355 --> 54:50.075
Victor...

54:50.115 --> 54:51.755
what?

54:51.755 --> 54:53.635
Where shall i
take her?

54:53.675 --> 54:55.315
First he said
it was over,

54:55.355 --> 54:56.915
then he asked me
to lunch.

54:56.955 --> 54:59.355
It was like
taking crazy 1 and 2.

54:59.395 --> 55:00.755
But I didn't care.

55:00.795 --> 55:03.755
I was so happy,
I wanted to give him a present

55:03.795 --> 55:06.715
something no one else
in the world could give him.

55:06.755 --> 55:09.115
What if we both went
a little bit crazy?

55:09.155 --> 55:10.555
Blame it on Rio

55:10.555 --> 55:12.955
what if our hearts
got a little bit hazy?

55:12.995 --> 55:14.835
Blame it on Rio

55:14.875 --> 55:16.315
what if we
acted like fools?

55:16.355 --> 55:18.075
Broke a few rules

55:18.115 --> 55:23.835
what do we care

55:23.875 --> 55:28.635
blame it on Rio?

55:28.675 --> 55:33.395
It's for you.

55:36.835 --> 55:38.755
Are you mad?
I can't keep this.

55:38.795 --> 55:40.715
Don't you like it?

55:40.715 --> 55:42.395
I think it's pretty.

55:42.435 --> 55:43.995
Get outta there.

55:44.035 --> 55:44.995
Maybe I'll sell it
at school.

55:45.035 --> 55:46.395
Better put it away

55:46.435 --> 55:47.875
before they're selling it
all over tokyo.

55:47.915 --> 55:49.275
Yes, uncle Matthew.

55:49.315 --> 55:50.755
I wish that's all
I was again.

55:50.795 --> 55:51.955
I truly do.

55:51.995 --> 55:53.115
No, you don't,

55:53.155 --> 55:54.475
or you would've never
asked me out for lunch

55:54.515 --> 55:55.915
do you know why
we're here?

55:55.915 --> 55:57.835
I'm supposed to find out
who your lover is

55:57.875 --> 56:00.235
before it drives
your father crazy.

56:00.275 --> 56:01.155
Poor daddy.

56:01.195 --> 56:02.635
Yours or Nicole's?

56:02.675 --> 56:03.675
Mine.

56:03.715 --> 56:05.635
That poor daddy.
You can't swing a dead cat

56:05.635 --> 56:07.315
without hitting
a poor daddy.

56:07.355 --> 56:08.995
What are you
going to tell him?

56:08.995 --> 56:10.195
He's my friend.

56:10.235 --> 56:11.355
I'll have to lie.

56:11.355 --> 56:13.515
I'll say that you
wouldn't tell me

56:13.555 --> 56:15.635
who your decrepit
married old man is,

56:15.675 --> 56:17.595
but you promised
it was all over between you.

56:17.635 --> 56:19.315
Then you
would be lying.

56:19.315 --> 56:20.955
It's never
going to be over.

56:20.995 --> 56:22.355
Can't you understand?

56:22.395 --> 56:24.075
I'm going to love you
forever.

56:24.115 --> 56:25.875
You have got
to stop using words

56:25.915 --> 56:27.675
like "forever"
and "married."

56:27.715 --> 56:30.035
Why?

56:30.075 --> 56:32.955
Because I happen to be one,
and we can never be the other.

56:46.555 --> 56:47.515
Jennifer, darling,

56:47.515 --> 56:49.435
even if it was
possible for us-

56:49.475 --> 56:51.315
I mean,
everyone else aside-

56:51.355 --> 56:53.275
you keep forgetting
the difference-

56:53.315 --> 56:55.195
I know, you're
a thousand years old.

56:55.235 --> 56:56.635
It doesn't matter.

56:56.675 --> 56:57.555
Jennifer-

56:57.595 --> 56:59.515
you can call me
darling if you like.

56:59.555 --> 57:00.915
It doesn't matter now,

57:00.955 --> 57:03.835
but when you're my age,
do you know what I'll be?

57:03.875 --> 57:05.275
Dead, I suppose.

57:05.315 --> 57:06.675
Dead and a half.

57:06.715 --> 57:09.595
Chaplin and picasso married
much younger women.

57:09.635 --> 57:12.435
Who, in turn, became
much younger widows.

57:12.475 --> 57:14.875
I'd rather spend a few years
with the man I love

57:14.875 --> 57:16.555
than a lifetime
with someone I don't.

57:16.595 --> 57:18.235
Well, if you're
going to use logic

57:18.235 --> 57:20.595
I'll lose my advantage

57:20.635 --> 57:23.395
I like it when you
treat me like a woman.

57:23.435 --> 57:26.755
I mean, outside of bed.

57:26.795 --> 57:28.155
Eat your meat.

57:28.195 --> 57:30.155
So much for
that treatment.

57:30.195 --> 57:32.595
Don't you know any boys
your own age you like?

57:32.635 --> 57:33.995
I don't like boys.

57:34.035 --> 57:36.435
You would if you
gave them a chance

57:36.475 --> 57:37.875
you said hello
to him before.

57:37.915 --> 57:39.795
He looks a decent sort.

57:39.835 --> 57:41.195
Clean-cut.

57:41.235 --> 57:43.115
The kind that calls
your father "sir"

57:43.155 --> 57:47.435
and tries to chew
the rivets off your jeans?

57:47.475 --> 57:50.355
Age doesn't matter.
I'm going to die young anyway.

57:50.395 --> 57:52.275
Iook how short
my life line is.

57:52.315 --> 57:53.275
That's all rubbish

57:53.315 --> 57:56.195
I practically don't
have one at all.

57:56.235 --> 58:00.515
That's not your life line.

58:00.555 --> 58:04.795
That's your heart line.

58:04.835 --> 58:09.635
Teeny little thing,
isn't it?

58:23.355 --> 58:25.715
You used to hold my hand
before we were lovers.

58:25.755 --> 58:30.515
See how it works?

58:30.555 --> 58:32.595
Bernardo!

58:32.635 --> 58:35.035
He's 19. is that
what you had in mind?

58:35.075 --> 58:36.915
19 is perfect.

58:36.955 --> 58:39.835
I've been 19 a couple
of times myself.

58:39.875 --> 58:42.715
Do you really
want me to?

58:42.755 --> 58:46.075
Go ahead.

58:56.035 --> 58:58.675
He was just what
I said she needed.

58:58.715 --> 59:00.955
Young, uninvolved,
uncomplicated.

59:00.995 --> 59:03.195
I couldn't
have been happier.

59:03.235 --> 59:07.315
Except for a sudden throb
in my temple

59:07.355 --> 59:11.395
that went all the way
down to my heart.

59:13.955 --> 59:16.355
She wouldn't tell you
anything about him?

59:16.395 --> 59:17.795
I'm sorry, Victor.

59:17.835 --> 59:19.235
Not a hint

59:19.235 --> 59:21.995
not a clue to who
the guy might be?

59:22.035 --> 59:24.715
All she said was
that he was confused.

59:24.755 --> 59:26.315
About what?

59:26.355 --> 59:28.395
Between his feelings
for Jennifer

59:28.435 --> 59:30.395
and his feelings
for his wife.

59:30.435 --> 59:32.355
Now he thinks
of his wife, right?

59:32.395 --> 59:34.315
I don't think the poor
bastard ever thought

59:34.355 --> 59:35.955
he'd get so
emotionally involved.

59:35.955 --> 59:36.955
Poor bastard, huh?

59:36.995 --> 59:39.115
If I get my hands on him,
I'll beat him to death

59:39.115 --> 59:40.795
that'll unconfuse him.

59:40.835 --> 59:43.715
A beating is not
the way, my friend.

59:43.755 --> 59:44.635
He's right, you know.

59:44.675 --> 59:49.955
Personally,
I prefer torture.

01:00:04.515 --> 01:00:05.915
What's the matter?

01:00:05.955 --> 01:00:08.795
I think I'm getting
strep throat.

01:00:08.835 --> 01:00:13.635
I have to get in early.
Thanks for tonight.

01:00:23.595 --> 01:00:25.995
Did you tell him?

01:00:26.035 --> 01:00:27.875
No.

01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:31.275
Well, good night.

01:00:35.595 --> 01:00:36.555
Is that Jennifer?

01:00:36.595 --> 01:00:38.435
Uh, yeah.

01:00:38.475 --> 01:00:41.835
Is she all right?
How'd she look?

01:00:41.875 --> 01:00:44.715
Quite beautiful,
actually.

01:00:44.715 --> 01:00:46.995
She is, isn't she?

01:00:47.035 --> 01:00:48.395
I think so

01:00:48.435 --> 01:00:51.675
just like her mother.

01:00:51.715 --> 01:00:54.595
Another one
of my screwups.

01:00:54.595 --> 01:00:56.515
It takes two,
Victor.

01:00:56.515 --> 01:00:59.835
Not to screw up.

01:00:59.835 --> 01:01:02.235
First my marriage,
now my kid.

01:01:02.235 --> 01:01:06.555
What do I blow next,
our friendship?

01:01:06.595 --> 01:01:08.435
If I ever lost that-

01:01:08.475 --> 01:01:11.355
I mean, if I ever blew it
between you and me,

01:01:11.395 --> 01:01:12.755
that'd be it.

01:01:12.795 --> 01:01:16.155
Victor, there's something
I've got to tell you.

01:01:16.195 --> 01:01:18.075
I can't bear
to see you this way.

01:01:18.115 --> 01:01:18.515
Me, neither.

01:01:18.555 --> 01:01:20.435
No, let me finish.

01:01:20.475 --> 01:01:22.355
We came here to have
a good time,

01:01:22.395 --> 01:01:24.795
and all I've done is
burden you with my problems.

01:01:24.835 --> 01:01:26.195
That's not true.

01:01:26.235 --> 01:01:29.115
You're a rock. My whole
crappy life is in chaos.

01:01:29.155 --> 01:01:31.475
A storm... and
you're the one rock

01:01:31.515 --> 01:01:33.435
right in the middle of it
I can cling to.

01:01:33.435 --> 01:01:35.315
You're a rock.

01:01:35.355 --> 01:01:37.235
Not entirely, Victor.

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:40.115
I mean,
I'm not all rock.

01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:42.995
I'm not worthy of you.

01:01:42.995 --> 01:01:45.875
I'm not worthy
of anybody.

01:01:45.915 --> 01:01:48.755
Victor, Victor,
you can't.

01:01:48.795 --> 01:01:51.115
This isn't for me.

01:01:51.155 --> 01:01:53.075
What do you think,
I'm crazy?

01:01:53.115 --> 01:01:54.955
This is for him.

01:01:54.995 --> 01:01:58.115
I'm gonna find him,
and whoever he is,

01:01:58.155 --> 01:02:01.235
he's gonna get this
right up the doodah.

01:02:01.275 --> 01:02:05.715
Ciao.

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:08.595
Nicky? Nicky?

01:02:08.635 --> 01:02:11.795
Where have you been
tonight? Last night?

01:02:11.795 --> 01:02:13.475
What do you care?

01:02:13.515 --> 01:02:15.115
I'm your father.

01:02:15.155 --> 01:02:16.675
Do I ask where you go?

01:02:16.715 --> 01:02:17.995
I have been here.

01:02:17.995 --> 01:02:20.715
Sure. This is
where the action is.

01:02:20.715 --> 01:02:23.355
I've played dumb
so often with you,

01:02:23.395 --> 01:02:27.075
I know when you're
playing dumb with me.

01:02:27.115 --> 01:02:30.955
I hope I'm as smart as you are
when I get to be your age.

01:02:30.995 --> 01:02:34.795
You always said that honesty
should never be painful.

01:02:34.835 --> 01:02:37.755
I was wrong.

01:02:37.755 --> 01:02:39.315
She's in love, you know.

01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:40.715
She thinks so.

01:02:40.755 --> 01:02:43.115
If you think so,
you are.

01:02:43.155 --> 01:02:45.075
The first is
always the hardest.

01:02:45.075 --> 01:02:46.515
You're not the first.

01:02:46.515 --> 01:02:48.395
Well, I know.

01:02:48.435 --> 01:02:50.875
They're all hard in a way.

01:02:50.915 --> 01:02:55.275
She'll get over you.
Just be yourself.

01:02:55.315 --> 01:02:59.155
I had to admit Jennifer
had gotten under my skin.

01:02:59.195 --> 01:03:01.515
I had no one
to turn to for advice.

01:03:01.555 --> 01:03:07.515
What I needed was
objective professional help.

01:03:12.315 --> 01:03:14.755
The more trouble
in heart and mind,

01:03:14.795 --> 01:03:18.635
the more candles you must burn
for the help of the gods.

01:03:18.675 --> 01:03:20.075
How young is the girl?

01:03:20.115 --> 01:03:21.515
Uh, she's quite young.

01:03:21.555 --> 01:03:23.675
Half your age?

01:03:23.715 --> 01:03:25.715
Less than half

01:03:25.755 --> 01:03:29.155
how many do I take

01:03:29.195 --> 01:03:32.515
take the whole box.

01:03:32.555 --> 01:03:35.875
A- ha!

01:03:44.915 --> 01:03:46.155
Matthew!
What?

01:03:46.195 --> 01:03:49.475
In here.

01:03:49.515 --> 01:03:52.875
Come in here!

01:03:52.915 --> 01:03:56.715
What's wrong?

01:03:56.755 --> 01:04:00.555
Close the door.

01:04:00.555 --> 01:04:02.715
What?

01:04:02.755 --> 01:04:05.115
Quiet. Wait.

01:04:05.155 --> 01:04:07.355
Shit!
What's going on?

01:04:07.395 --> 01:04:11.195
Jennifer's diary.

01:04:11.195 --> 01:04:12.115
Her diary?

01:04:12.155 --> 01:04:18.355
That's not all.
Iook at this.

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:20.275
You can't look at that.
He took pictures of her.

01:04:20.315 --> 01:04:21.715
Oh, I'm sure
he wouldn't.

01:04:21.755 --> 01:04:23.155
He wouldn't, huh?

01:04:23.155 --> 01:04:28.075
He forced himself on her
at the beach, didn't he?

01:04:28.075 --> 01:04:29.275
Victor!

01:04:29.315 --> 01:04:30.435
What?

01:04:30.475 --> 01:04:32.835
You can't read that.
That is someone's

01:04:32.875 --> 01:04:34.755
private
personal property.

01:04:34.755 --> 01:04:40.515
Are you nuts?
Whose side are you on?

01:04:40.555 --> 01:04:42.395
Listen to this.

01:04:42.435 --> 01:04:44.315
"Last night
it finally happened.

01:04:44.355 --> 01:04:48.195
"We lay in the sand together,
my body next to his.

01:04:48.235 --> 01:04:50.595
"My legs, his legs,
each of us the other."

01:04:50.635 --> 01:04:51.795
Disgusting.

01:04:51.835 --> 01:04:53.875
She said that?

01:04:53.875 --> 01:04:55.835
I said that.

01:04:55.875 --> 01:04:57.275
It goes on and on.

01:04:57.315 --> 01:05:03.075
Come on, Jennifer,
what's his name?

01:05:03.115 --> 01:05:03.995
A- ha!

01:05:04.035 --> 01:05:05.515
Victor, I can explain.

01:05:05.555 --> 01:05:07.435
"He's all
I ever dreamed of.

01:05:07.475 --> 01:05:11.795
"He's a much better
lover than moose."

01:05:11.835 --> 01:05:14.155
Moose?

01:05:14.195 --> 01:05:15.595
Who the hell
is moose?

01:05:15.635 --> 01:05:17.035
Must be some kid
at school.

01:05:17.075 --> 01:05:18.515
She never told me
about him, either.

01:05:18.555 --> 01:05:20.435
How can you send her
to a school

01:05:20.475 --> 01:05:22.355
where the guys
are called "moose"

01:05:22.355 --> 01:05:23.315
explain what?

01:05:23.315 --> 01:05:24.235
What?

01:05:24.275 --> 01:05:25.795
You said you could
explain something.

01:05:25.835 --> 01:05:28.155
I can. Yes.

01:05:28.195 --> 01:05:31.555
This-this.
I can explain this

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:33.955
it's youth.
That's all

01:05:33.995 --> 01:05:35.355
kids exaggerate.

01:05:35.395 --> 01:05:38.275
They make things up.
They make people up.

01:05:38.275 --> 01:05:40.155
Oh, yeah?

01:05:40.195 --> 01:05:42.915
Did she make this up?

01:05:42.955 --> 01:05:45.315
"I go to sleep with
his smile on my lips.

01:05:45.355 --> 01:05:48.715
"I love his sweet mouth.
His funny little teeth.

01:05:48.755 --> 01:05:51.275
"I love looking
deep into his soul

01:05:51.315 --> 01:05:54.275
"through his
lovely blue eyes,

01:05:54.315 --> 01:05:57.235
"eyes that seem
to see the real me

01:05:57.275 --> 01:05:59.675
"for the very first time."

01:05:59.715 --> 01:06:02.035
Why are you wearing those?

01:06:02.075 --> 01:06:03.275
I'm getting a sty.

01:06:03.275 --> 01:06:04.435
Just like that?

01:06:04.475 --> 01:06:07.795
How else?

01:06:12.115 --> 01:06:13.995
I don't believe it.

01:06:14.035 --> 01:06:15.475
She doesn't say
who he is anywhere.

01:06:15.515 --> 01:06:17.355
Nowhere?

01:06:17.395 --> 01:06:19.115
The hell with it.

01:06:19.155 --> 01:06:20.835
We got enough clues.

01:06:20.875 --> 01:06:21.835
Come on.

01:06:21.835 --> 01:06:22.715
Where?

01:06:22.755 --> 01:06:25.155
You and I are gonna
find that bastard.

01:06:25.195 --> 01:06:28.755
Wings to the sky

01:06:28.795 --> 01:06:31.555
floats
easy and free there?

01:06:31.595 --> 01:06:33.515
Try to think. Didn't
she tell you anything?

01:06:33.555 --> 01:06:34.915
You're her best friend.

01:06:34.955 --> 01:06:36.395
Sometimes even
best friends

01:06:36.395 --> 01:06:37.795
keep secrets
from each other.

01:06:37.835 --> 01:06:40.235
A nickname, a pet name.
Where he lives.

01:06:40.235 --> 01:06:41.155
Who can remember

01:06:41.155 --> 01:06:43.075
everyone she
goes out with?

01:06:43.115 --> 01:06:44.515
There's more
than one?

01:06:44.515 --> 01:06:47.315
Well, there's the dancer
at the club we were at.

01:06:47.355 --> 01:06:48.235
The singer, too.

01:06:48.275 --> 01:06:49.715
She's seeing
all of them?

01:06:49.755 --> 01:06:51.115
You know how it is, dad.

01:06:51.155 --> 01:06:52.555
When you're hot,
you're hot.

01:06:52.595 --> 01:06:54.995
Any of these guys
own a polaroid?

01:06:55.035 --> 01:06:56.395
What?

01:06:56.435 --> 01:06:59.915
Never mind.
Let's go.

01:06:59.955 --> 01:07:03.395
Be careful, Nicky.

01:07:03.435 --> 01:07:06.235
You're not really gonna
go up on that, are you

01:07:06.275 --> 01:07:09.075
I like to live dangerously.
Runs in the family.

01:07:09.115 --> 01:07:13.835
Days of your life

01:07:13.875 --> 01:07:16.995
these wings to the sky?

01:07:17.035 --> 01:07:19.915
I really appreciate
you not saying anything.

01:07:19.955 --> 01:07:22.315
My father's had
a lot of experience,

01:07:22.355 --> 01:07:24.235
but he'd never
understand this.

01:07:24.275 --> 01:07:25.435
I wish he knew, though.

01:07:25.475 --> 01:07:27.035
Why don't you tell him

01:07:27.035 --> 01:07:28.515
I want your dad to.

01:07:28.555 --> 01:07:29.995
He won't.
He's a coward.

01:07:30.035 --> 01:07:31.195
Mine's blind.

01:07:31.235 --> 01:07:32.515
I'll trade you

01:07:32.555 --> 01:07:33.795
I sort of have.

01:07:33.835 --> 01:07:35.715
Who'd you send him
to look for?

01:07:35.755 --> 01:07:38.155
Just a couple of guys
to throw them off the track.

01:07:38.155 --> 01:07:40.035
That's hysterical.
Who?

01:07:40.075 --> 01:07:41.995
Like the singer
at the club.

01:07:41.995 --> 01:07:43.395
He's gross

01:07:43.435 --> 01:07:45.315
that's why I picked him.

01:07:45.315 --> 01:07:48.395
You think your dad'll
get jealous?

01:07:48.435 --> 01:07:51.475
It's the least
I could do for him.

01:07:55.395 --> 01:07:57.715
Come up and dance!
Somebody! Anybody!

01:07:57.755 --> 01:08:02.515
Don't be shy!
Come up and dance!

01:08:11.595 --> 01:08:13.515
Uh, no. No. No.

01:08:13.515 --> 01:08:18.314
Not me.
I'm with my friend.

01:08:18.354 --> 01:08:20.234
No, I-I can't dance.

01:08:20.274 --> 01:08:23.075
I can't!

01:08:23.115 --> 01:08:26.475
I can't. I-I don't
know how to dance.

01:08:26.515 --> 01:08:29.795
Hi, uncle Matthew.

01:08:29.835 --> 01:08:31.995
It won't work,
you know.

01:08:32.035 --> 01:08:34.115
Trying to make
me jealous.

01:08:34.154 --> 01:08:36.154
You think you're
playing with a kid.

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:38.995
You think you are.

01:08:39.035 --> 01:08:44.314
Please, I'm getting
over a bereavement

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:46.234
your father
is out of his mind

01:08:46.274 --> 01:08:47.154
what else is new?

01:08:47.194 --> 01:08:48.635
And I'm not
much better.

01:08:48.675 --> 01:08:50.035
Really?

01:08:50.075 --> 01:08:51.955
I need time to think
things over.

01:08:51.995 --> 01:08:56.795
You don't have much time
at your age, do you?

01:08:59.675 --> 01:09:01.475
Did you really go out
with this android?

01:09:01.515 --> 01:09:03.035
I think he likes
you better.

01:09:03.035 --> 01:09:06.835
See you later.

01:09:13.835 --> 01:09:16.234
Well, what do you think?
Is he the guy?

01:09:16.274 --> 01:09:17.475
I don't know.

01:09:17.515 --> 01:09:18.635
You don't know?

01:09:18.635 --> 01:09:22.475
You want one more
dance with him?

01:09:26.715 --> 01:09:28.635
That guy's singing
right to her.

01:09:28.675 --> 01:09:30.035
It doesn't
mean anything.

01:09:30.075 --> 01:09:34.875
What are the words?
What's he singing?

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:40.595
He says...

01:09:40.595 --> 01:09:42.515
"his love is the sea

01:09:42.515 --> 01:09:44.915
"that goes on
forever more."

01:09:44.955 --> 01:09:46.314
Yeah?

01:09:46.354 --> 01:09:48.274
"He lives
to return to her

01:09:48.314 --> 01:09:50.194
"again and again..."

01:09:50.234 --> 01:09:52.075
yeah?

01:09:52.115 --> 01:09:54.475
"And-and beat
against her shore.

01:09:54.515 --> 01:09:56.435
I'll give him
"beat against her shore."

01:09:56.475 --> 01:09:57.355
Victor

01:09:57.395 --> 01:09:59.715
Victor, don't!

01:09:59.715 --> 01:10:01.995
Daddy!

01:10:02.035 --> 01:10:04.275
No!

01:10:04.315 --> 01:10:07.995
Victor, stop it!

01:10:08.035 --> 01:10:11.675
Victor, don't!

01:10:14.755 --> 01:10:16.675
Victor, stop!

01:10:16.715 --> 01:10:18.995
Ohh!

01:10:19.035 --> 01:10:21.275
Victor!

01:10:24.635 --> 01:10:27.395
He's got brown eyes.

01:10:27.435 --> 01:10:29.315
Welcome, my friends.

01:10:29.315 --> 01:10:31.115
It's all yours-

01:10:31.155 --> 01:10:34.515
the night, the sky,
my city, my restaurant

01:10:34.555 --> 01:10:38.795
claudio, champagne

01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:40.755
this is not a night
to celebrate.

01:10:40.795 --> 01:10:42.675
You did not
find him?

01:10:42.675 --> 01:10:44.555
Not yet...

01:10:44.595 --> 01:10:46.275
but he can't
hide forever.

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:47.915
Give it a rest, Victor.

01:10:47.955 --> 01:10:50.795
You can make yourself
sick over this.

01:10:50.835 --> 01:10:53.475
Gold.
The man is gold.

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:56.035
As a friend
should be.

01:10:56.075 --> 01:10:58.955
Now we look
at the menu, yes?

01:10:58.995 --> 01:11:01.835
The stomach
also has a heart.

01:11:01.875 --> 01:11:05.155
Daddy?

01:11:05.195 --> 01:11:06.595
I've gotta
talk to you.

01:11:06.635 --> 01:11:08.555
Of course, sweetheart.
You want to be alone?

01:11:08.595 --> 01:11:13.995
This is fine.

01:11:14.035 --> 01:11:17.875
I love you, daddy,
very much.

01:11:17.955 --> 01:11:21.795
I can't let you go around
beating people up...

01:11:21.835 --> 01:11:27.555
getting hurt yourself...

01:11:27.595 --> 01:11:29.915
what happened...

01:11:29.955 --> 01:11:32.115
happened out of tenderness

01:11:32.115 --> 01:11:33.675
out of beautiful feelings.

01:11:33.715 --> 01:11:35.235
Don't think of it as ugly.

01:11:35.235 --> 01:11:37.595
I don't want to.

01:11:37.595 --> 01:11:39.395
Just tell me who it is,
sweetheart.

01:11:39.435 --> 01:11:44.715
Just tell me so we can
get this all behind us.

01:11:52.395 --> 01:11:53.795
You!

01:11:53.835 --> 01:11:57.635
Eu? Ela louca!

01:11:57.675 --> 01:11:59.955
I'll give you
louca!
Come here!

01:11:59.995 --> 01:12:00.915
Why didn't you tell him?

01:12:00.955 --> 01:12:02.355
You wanted me to.

01:12:02.395 --> 01:12:03.755
Yes.

01:12:03.795 --> 01:12:05.195
Then you'll tell him.

01:12:05.235 --> 01:12:09.555
You'll speak
for both of us.

01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:15.395
It could not be me.

01:12:15.435 --> 01:12:16.315
No, huh?

01:12:16.355 --> 01:12:17.755
I am impotent.

01:12:17.795 --> 01:12:19.715
I've seen you in the market
with young women.

01:12:19.755 --> 01:12:21.595
Shopping is no problem.

01:12:21.635 --> 01:12:23.075
Victor, does he
look 43 to you

01:12:23.115 --> 01:12:24.235
I am 57!

01:12:24.275 --> 01:12:26.035
Horseshit!

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:27.755
All right. 61.

01:12:27.755 --> 01:12:29.675
He's too old.
He's not married.

01:12:29.715 --> 01:12:31.595
He's not anything
that diary said.

01:12:31.635 --> 01:12:33.995
You said kids
invent things.

01:12:34.035 --> 01:12:35.875
And you saw her.

01:12:35.915 --> 01:12:38.315
She stared
right at him.

01:12:38.355 --> 01:12:39.235
It's him!

01:12:39.275 --> 01:12:40.915
It's not anyone
we've seen!

01:12:40.955 --> 01:12:44.275
How do you know?

01:12:44.315 --> 01:12:47.635
Because it's me.

01:12:54.635 --> 01:12:57.355
You.

01:12:57.395 --> 01:13:00.075
Me.

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:05.355
Say something,
Victor.

01:13:05.395 --> 01:13:09.835
Hit me.

01:13:09.875 --> 01:13:14.235
Hit him.

01:13:14.275 --> 01:13:18.515
Not hitting me feels
worse than if you did.

01:13:18.555 --> 01:13:23.115
How'd it happen?

01:13:23.155 --> 01:13:27.675
It was my fault.

01:13:27.715 --> 01:13:29.635
I take full
responsibility.

01:13:29.675 --> 01:13:32.195
That's big of you.

01:13:32.235 --> 01:13:34.155
It was the night
of the wedding.

01:13:34.155 --> 01:13:36.795
Ah, romance
was in the air.

01:13:36.835 --> 01:13:39.395
Birds, music,
dancing, drums.

01:13:39.435 --> 01:13:41.595
Everything at once.

01:13:41.635 --> 01:13:43.675
Blame it on Rio, eh?

01:13:43.715 --> 01:13:46.595
I wasn't thinking
what I was doing.

01:13:46.635 --> 01:13:48.115
You understand.

01:13:48.155 --> 01:13:50.915
It's only when a man is not
thinking of what he's doing

01:13:50.955 --> 01:13:53.715
that you can be sure he's
doing what he's thinking.

01:13:53.755 --> 01:13:54.635
Thanks.

01:13:54.675 --> 01:13:56.075
You were by my side

01:13:56.115 --> 01:13:58.835
the whole time we were
looking for him.

01:13:58.875 --> 01:14:02.995
What a horse's ass you
must have thought I was.

01:14:03.035 --> 01:14:04.395
I didn't have
the courage.

01:14:04.435 --> 01:14:09.235
Who asked you
for the courage now?

01:14:09.275 --> 01:14:12.115
Why'd you have
to tell me?

01:14:12.155 --> 01:14:14.035
In spite of it all,

01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:15.915
I'm your friend.

01:14:15.955 --> 01:14:16.875
If you were
really my friend,

01:14:16.915 --> 01:14:19.795
you would've kept quiet
about what you did.

01:14:19.835 --> 01:14:22.195
Which you never
would've done

01:14:22.235 --> 01:14:24.595
if you were
really my friend.

01:14:24.635 --> 01:14:26.515
Hit me.

01:14:26.555 --> 01:14:28.395
Please.

01:14:28.435 --> 01:14:30.235
Will you really
feel worse if I don't?

01:14:30.275 --> 01:14:32.115
Terrible.

01:14:32.155 --> 01:14:39.355
Good night, Matthew.

01:14:40.595 --> 01:14:42.115
Wrong is the urge

01:14:42.115 --> 01:14:44.035
that I feel to be simple

01:14:44.035 --> 01:14:46.275
when the light
falls just right

01:14:46.275 --> 01:14:48.475
and her eyes
are inviting me

01:14:48.515 --> 01:14:49.875
and who in the world

01:14:49.915 --> 01:14:56.035
is immune
to the sensual moon

01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:57.435
chills up my spine

01:14:57.475 --> 01:14:59.395
tell me
I'm just the victim

01:14:59.435 --> 01:15:01.275
without hope to resist

01:15:01.315 --> 01:15:03.715
it's a fever
that tears me down

01:15:03.755 --> 01:15:06.555
and if by some chance

01:15:06.595 --> 01:15:08.995
they should happen
to stumble on a cure

01:15:09.035 --> 01:15:11.915
don't tell me

01:15:11.955 --> 01:15:15.315
once temptation gets

01:15:15.355 --> 01:15:19.395
the best of me

01:15:19.435 --> 01:15:24.435
will these restless
feelings stir

01:15:24.475 --> 01:15:27.155
there's trouble

01:15:27.195 --> 01:15:35.555
once temptation
gets the best of me

01:15:35.595 --> 01:15:43.195
then I'm helpless
next to her

01:15:43.235 --> 01:15:47.075
chills up my spine tell me
I'm just the victim...?

01:15:47.075 --> 01:15:49.235
Psst!

01:15:49.275 --> 01:15:51.355
Matthew!

01:15:51.395 --> 01:15:52.315
I want to talk to you.

01:15:52.355 --> 01:15:53.275
Did you tell him?

01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:56.635
Yes.

01:15:57.315 --> 01:15:58.395
Why aren't you in bed?

01:15:58.395 --> 01:16:03.275
I was just going.

01:16:03.315 --> 01:16:06.635
Go to sleep.

01:16:09.795 --> 01:16:11.195
Come on.

01:16:11.235 --> 01:16:15.155
Come on down!

01:16:15.195 --> 01:16:19.075
Careful! Careful!

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:20.995
Quick, get in the car.
Come on.

01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:23.915
Where are we going?

01:16:23.955 --> 01:16:26.755
Nowhere. Get in.

01:16:31.075 --> 01:16:33.955
You really told him?
I'm so proud of you.

01:16:33.995 --> 01:16:35.395
You're probably
the only one who is.

01:16:35.435 --> 01:16:36.595
Oh, Matthew.

01:16:36.635 --> 01:16:37.755
Wait, wait

01:16:37.795 --> 01:16:40.635
it's got to stop.
Really.

01:16:40.675 --> 01:16:43.075
We can't go on.
Not a minute longer.

01:16:43.115 --> 01:16:44.475
But now that he knows-

01:16:44.515 --> 01:16:47.435
it makes our relationship
even more impossible.

01:16:47.475 --> 01:16:50.355
Stop hiding behind words
like "relationship."

01:16:50.395 --> 01:16:52.715
We're in love. You said.

01:16:52.755 --> 01:16:55.155
I was hoping, in my
usual dumb fashion

01:16:55.195 --> 01:16:56.555
that whenever it ended

01:16:56.595 --> 01:16:58.595
it would be without
your father ever knowing.

01:16:58.635 --> 01:17:01.675
But now he does-

01:17:01.715 --> 01:17:04.715
must be Nicky.

01:17:04.755 --> 01:17:06.635
I'm too old for this.

01:17:06.675 --> 01:17:09.995
Hiding in front seats
like a teenager.

01:17:10.035 --> 01:17:13.355
Next thing you know,
my skin'll be breaking out

01:17:13.395 --> 01:17:15.275
if this doesn't kill
your respect for me-

01:17:15.315 --> 01:17:17.195
nothing can.

01:17:17.195 --> 01:17:19.595
You didn't really
mean what you said.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:21.955
Please don't.

01:17:21.995 --> 01:17:23.915
That's only
going to work...

01:17:23.955 --> 01:17:26.355
and it can't.

01:17:26.355 --> 01:17:29.355
Matthew-

01:17:29.395 --> 01:17:32.355
good night!

01:17:38.595 --> 01:17:40.035
Matthew...

01:17:40.075 --> 01:17:41.715
I love you so.

01:17:41.755 --> 01:17:43.355
Jennifer...

01:17:43.395 --> 01:17:45.115
you know you love me.

01:17:45.155 --> 01:17:46.755
Don't you understand?

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:49.835
That doesn't matter.

01:17:49.875 --> 01:17:52.875
That's all that matters.

01:18:09.195 --> 01:18:11.115
I just think you ought
to come right away.

01:18:11.155 --> 01:18:13.035
Are you all right?

01:18:13.075 --> 01:18:14.435
Nicole?

01:18:14.475 --> 01:18:16.395
Dad needs you.
He's in real trouble.

01:18:16.435 --> 01:18:18.275
What's happened?
Is he hurt?

01:18:18.315 --> 01:18:22.915
He's going to be, mom,
and not just him.

01:18:22.955 --> 01:18:24.835
Jennifer!
Get your stuff out here!

01:18:24.875 --> 01:18:26.795
10 minutes!

01:18:26.835 --> 01:18:28.755
We're getting the hell out
of this goddamn paradise!

01:18:28.795 --> 01:18:29.675
Up yours!

01:18:29.715 --> 01:18:34.035
Jennifer! Let's go

01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:44.555
Victor-

01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:46.275
out of my way, blue eyes.
You think I'm leaving

01:18:46.275 --> 01:18:47.915
my share of the groceries
here, you're nuts.

01:18:47.955 --> 01:18:48.955
Give me a minute.

01:18:48.995 --> 01:18:50.915
A minute? I'd like
to give you life!

01:18:50.955 --> 01:18:53.355
Stop shouting!

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:55.075
I just want you to know
that I'm not somebody

01:18:55.115 --> 01:18:56.755
who hangs around schoolyards
in a raincoat.

01:18:56.795 --> 01:18:58.635
Try it.
You'd be very good

01:18:58.675 --> 01:19:00.115
I'll give you a letter
of recommendation.

01:19:00.155 --> 01:19:02.035
I felt very deeply
for Jennifer.

01:19:02.075 --> 01:19:02.995
Real affection.

01:19:03.035 --> 01:19:04.395
Touching.

01:19:04.435 --> 01:19:05.395
Even so, I made up
my mind to give her up

01:19:05.435 --> 01:19:06.835
I told her
I was giving her up.

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:08.755
You bet your ass
you are!

01:19:08.795 --> 01:19:10.155
But I can't.

01:19:10.195 --> 01:19:11.915
I care for her too much.

01:19:11.955 --> 01:19:13.595
Why the hell
wouldn't you?

01:19:13.635 --> 01:19:16.275
She's adorable, sweet,
smart, innocent.

01:19:16.315 --> 01:19:18.915
Mostly!
You'd have to be
even more senile

01:19:18.955 --> 01:19:20.835
than you are
not to care for her.

01:19:20.875 --> 01:19:22.515
I am not senile.

01:19:22.555 --> 01:19:24.155
I'm crazy about her.

01:19:24.195 --> 01:19:26.595
What the hell are you doing,
asking for her hand?

01:19:26.635 --> 01:19:28.995
With this teething ring,
I thee wed?

01:19:29.035 --> 01:19:29.915
Is that it?

01:19:29.955 --> 01:19:31.355
You want permission
to marry?

01:19:31.395 --> 01:19:33.635
Ask your wife first.
That's better manners.

01:19:33.675 --> 01:19:35.995
Hey, but wait a minute,
if she says no,

01:19:35.995 --> 01:19:38.355
maybe you and Karen
could adopt Jennifer.

01:19:38.395 --> 01:19:40.915
I could still see her.
I could baby-sit.

01:19:40.955 --> 01:19:43.155
She is a woman, Victor.
She's very mature.

01:19:43.195 --> 01:19:45.395
Too bad we can't say
the same thing about you!

01:19:45.395 --> 01:19:47.555
I love her.
It's as simple as that

01:19:47.595 --> 01:19:49.715
sure, you do!
What else can you say?

01:19:49.715 --> 01:19:50.635
I'm serious!

01:19:50.675 --> 01:19:52.555
I never thought I could
care this much again!

01:19:52.555 --> 01:19:54.955
You say that one more time,
I'll take your head off!

01:19:54.995 --> 01:19:55.795
Victor!

01:19:55.835 --> 01:19:57.755
Karen.
What are you
doing here?

01:19:57.795 --> 01:19:59.075
Let Matthew go.

01:19:59.115 --> 01:20:01.115
Why did you leave bahía?
Are you all right?

01:20:01.155 --> 01:20:03.115
Nicky called. She said
you were in trouble.

01:20:03.155 --> 01:20:04.835
Me, in trouble?

01:20:04.835 --> 01:20:06.235
There's no trouble here?

01:20:06.275 --> 01:20:07.675
Is that what
you're telling me?

01:20:07.715 --> 01:20:09.595
Victor is choking you
just for laughs?

01:20:09.635 --> 01:20:12.515
Victor, stop it!
Stop acting like a maniac!

01:20:12.555 --> 01:20:14.475
Me? You want
to hear maniac?

01:20:14.475 --> 01:20:16.355
Ok, here you go.
Tell her!

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:17.275
Hold it!

01:20:17.315 --> 01:20:19.235
It's tough for you.
I'll tell her.

01:20:19.275 --> 01:20:20.195
Tell me what?
Wait!

01:20:20.235 --> 01:20:21.395
Brace yourself

01:20:21.435 --> 01:20:22.555
stop preparing me!

01:20:22.595 --> 01:20:25.075
Karen,
I've been unfaithful.

01:20:25.115 --> 01:20:26.475
Matthew!

01:20:26.515 --> 01:20:27.835
Is this a joke?

01:20:27.875 --> 01:20:29.795
Wait'll you hear
the punch line.

01:20:29.835 --> 01:20:31.635
Matthew?

01:20:31.675 --> 01:20:33.395
It's true.

01:20:33.435 --> 01:20:34.275
Ask him with who.

01:20:34.315 --> 01:20:35.115
Shut up, Victor!

01:20:35.155 --> 01:20:37.515
Karen, can we be alone?

01:20:37.555 --> 01:20:40.435
I think you have been
alone long enough.

01:20:40.475 --> 01:20:41.635
Who is she?

01:20:41.675 --> 01:20:43.195
Jennifer.

01:20:43.235 --> 01:20:44.955
Jennifer who?

01:20:44.995 --> 01:20:46.635
Jennifer?

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.115
Cute little sweet
little Jennifer?

01:20:48.155 --> 01:20:49.595
Yeah.

01:20:49.635 --> 01:20:50.555
That little bitch.

01:20:50.595 --> 01:20:52.755
Wait a minute.
Jennifer's my daughter.

01:20:52.795 --> 01:20:54.915
Exactly! How could
you let this happen?

01:20:54.955 --> 01:20:56.355
Me? How could i
let it happen?

01:20:56.395 --> 01:20:57.555
He had no idea.

01:20:57.595 --> 01:20:58.715
Does Nicky know?

01:20:58.755 --> 01:21:01.115
Nicky who?
You bastard.

01:21:01.155 --> 01:21:04.035
I didn't mean
to be a bastard.

01:21:04.075 --> 01:21:06.915
Oh, I know.
It's just a gift.

01:21:07.075 --> 01:21:08.755
Is that
your composition, dear?

01:21:08.795 --> 01:21:10.435
"What I did on
my summer vacation."

01:21:10.475 --> 01:21:12.395
I came here
as fast as I could

01:21:12.435 --> 01:21:14.315
because I thought
you needed me.

01:21:14.355 --> 01:21:16.195
You didn't need me.
You were fine.

01:21:16.235 --> 01:21:18.155
A fantasy come true.

01:21:18.155 --> 01:21:19.995
Gidget goes to Rio

01:21:20.035 --> 01:21:22.435
and what the hell
is wrong with you?

01:21:22.475 --> 01:21:23.835
Were you blind?

01:21:23.875 --> 01:21:25.795
I had no idea. They were alone.
I was out every night.

01:21:25.835 --> 01:21:28.155
Oh, really?

01:21:28.195 --> 01:21:30.115
No big deal.
Just for dinner.

01:21:30.155 --> 01:21:31.035
I'm sure.

01:21:31.075 --> 01:21:32.995
Why do you have
to explain to her?

01:21:33.035 --> 01:21:34.395
I don't. Really.

01:21:34.435 --> 01:21:36.835
Exactly. What you do
is none of my business.

01:21:36.875 --> 01:21:38.315
What you do is.

01:21:38.355 --> 01:21:40.035
But it's important
that you understand-

01:21:40.075 --> 01:21:41.715
Victor, this is between
Matthew and me.

01:21:41.755 --> 01:21:43.155
I'm not just
an outsider here.

01:21:43.195 --> 01:21:44.075
Right now you are.

01:21:44.115 --> 01:21:46.035
Victor, you have
every right to be hurt.

01:21:46.075 --> 01:21:48.515
I know how much
you love her.

01:21:48.555 --> 01:21:49.475
Who said I love her?

01:21:49.515 --> 01:21:50.875
Victor!

01:21:50.915 --> 01:21:52.915
Are you saying
you don't love Jennifer?

01:21:52.915 --> 01:21:56.475
Of course I love her.
What do you take me for?

01:21:56.515 --> 01:22:01.275
Who did you think I meant?

01:22:01.315 --> 01:22:04.115
What's going on here?

01:22:04.155 --> 01:22:05.835
I've wanted to tell you,
Matthew.

01:22:05.875 --> 01:22:07.515
It's what I went away
to think about.

01:22:07.555 --> 01:22:08.435
Tell me what?

01:22:08.475 --> 01:22:10.355
We're in love.
No, we're not!

01:22:10.395 --> 01:22:11.835
What do you mean,
"we're in love"?

01:22:11.875 --> 01:22:13.235
What do you mean
we're not?

01:22:13.275 --> 01:22:15.195
Quiet, both of you!
I can't lead a double life.

01:22:15.235 --> 01:22:17.595
You had that kind
of marriage. I don't.

01:22:17.595 --> 01:22:19.035
Are you two
having an affair?

01:22:19.035 --> 01:22:19.955
Were.

01:22:19.995 --> 01:22:21.915
Were having
an affair?

01:22:21.915 --> 01:22:23.315
You and Victor?

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:25.715
What's even worse,
Victor and you?

01:22:25.755 --> 01:22:28.595
He's offended,
mr. Clean.

01:22:28.595 --> 01:22:30.635
No wonder you were so upset
she wasn't coming.

01:22:30.675 --> 01:22:32.035
More upset than you.

01:22:32.075 --> 01:22:35.435
So preoccupied all the time.
So injured. So self-righteous.

01:22:35.435 --> 01:22:37.835
Sleeping with someone else's
wife doesn't count?

01:22:37.835 --> 01:22:40.195
At least your wife isn't
anybody's daughter

01:22:40.235 --> 01:22:41.395
how could you?

01:22:41.435 --> 01:22:42.515
How could I?

01:22:42.555 --> 01:22:44.395
Mom?

01:22:44.435 --> 01:22:45.715
Nicky, darling.

01:22:45.755 --> 01:22:46.995
How could you?

01:22:47.035 --> 01:22:49.435
We were in love.
That makes a difference.

01:22:49.435 --> 01:22:51.995
Iove?

01:22:51.995 --> 01:22:52.955
We weren't
just looking for a thrill.

01:22:52.995 --> 01:22:54.715
Is that why you did it?

01:22:54.715 --> 01:22:56.875
Listen to this...

01:22:56.915 --> 01:22:59.315
"Matthew dearest, I don't
want to go on without you.

01:22:59.315 --> 01:23:03.595
"I'll dream of you
eternally."

01:23:15.715 --> 01:23:17.635
The last time we were
together like this,

01:23:17.635 --> 01:23:19.995
we were waiting
for her to be born.

01:23:20.035 --> 01:23:22.395
Victor?

01:23:22.395 --> 01:23:25.275
As strange as it
may sound,

01:23:25.315 --> 01:23:28.435
I love you.

01:23:28.475 --> 01:23:31.515
Senhor Lyons?

01:23:31.555 --> 01:23:35.795
Yes?

01:23:35.835 --> 01:23:39.675
We've done all we can.

01:23:39.715 --> 01:23:43.515
She's out of danger.

01:23:46.875 --> 01:23:48.755
Thank god.

01:23:48.795 --> 01:23:51.675
I had no idea she had
any sleeping pills.

01:23:51.715 --> 01:23:53.595
How many did she take?

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:54.795
None.

01:23:54.835 --> 01:23:55.955
None?

01:23:55.995 --> 01:23:57.915
Your daughter
took an overdose

01:23:57.915 --> 01:24:02.195
of birth control pills.

01:24:06.435 --> 01:24:07.835
That's not
a problem, is it?

01:24:07.875 --> 01:24:09.795
She's not gonna grow a beard
or anything like that?

01:24:09.835 --> 01:24:11.195
No.

01:24:11.235 --> 01:24:13.155
Is she allowed
visitors, doctor?

01:24:13.195 --> 01:24:16.915
One, perhaps, and...

01:24:16.955 --> 01:24:20.715
for just a moment.

01:24:20.715 --> 01:24:24.435
Hello, aunt Karen.

01:24:24.475 --> 01:24:26.395
The doctor said
you're going to be fine.

01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:27.835
They pumped
my stomach

01:24:27.835 --> 01:24:29.795
mmm.

01:24:29.835 --> 01:24:32.235
I'm not on any kind
of machine, am I?

01:24:32.275 --> 01:24:33.155
Believe me, Jennifer,

01:24:33.195 --> 01:24:35.595
there's not a plug
in here worth pulling.

01:24:35.635 --> 01:24:37.475
All you need is rest.

01:24:37.515 --> 01:24:40.395
I've got some sleeping pills
if you'd like.

01:24:40.435 --> 01:24:41.315
You're angry.

01:24:41.355 --> 01:24:44.675
No. It'll take a while
to be angry.

01:24:44.715 --> 01:24:48.235
I've got to get over furious
first, you little shit.

01:24:48.275 --> 01:24:49.635
When you get older,

01:24:49.675 --> 01:24:52.075
and obviously you're going
to get a second chance at that,

01:24:52.115 --> 01:24:54.275
you'll find you can't have
whatever you want,

01:24:54.275 --> 01:24:57.515
and there's a price
for everything you get

01:24:57.555 --> 01:25:00.715
and sometimes other people
have to pay it.

01:25:00.755 --> 01:25:02.755
He loves you.

01:25:02.795 --> 01:25:04.715
He told me.

01:25:04.755 --> 01:25:07.635
That you talked together
bothers me more than anything.

01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:10.035
It's all my fault,
really.

01:25:10.035 --> 01:25:11.755
He never had a chance.

01:25:11.795 --> 01:25:14.235
Men seldom do.

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:16.115
Please...

01:25:16.155 --> 01:25:18.995
don't hate me.

01:25:19.035 --> 01:25:23.355
It's more like envy.

01:25:28.515 --> 01:25:30.675
Karen?

01:25:30.715 --> 01:25:32.835
Go away.

01:25:35.715 --> 01:25:37.115
Nicky?

01:25:37.155 --> 01:25:42.035
Go away.
This is a recording.

01:25:46.835 --> 01:25:48.995
What do you want?

01:25:49.035 --> 01:25:51.155
There's no other bed.

01:25:51.195 --> 01:25:52.115
Bastard.

01:25:52.155 --> 01:25:53.035
Prick.

01:25:53.075 --> 01:25:54.435
And to think
I said I love you.

01:25:54.435 --> 01:25:56.315
To who?
To you

01:25:56.355 --> 01:25:57.875
you love anything
that stands still.

01:25:57.915 --> 01:25:59.675
Unlike some
people I know.

01:25:59.715 --> 01:26:00.635
Screw you.

01:26:00.635 --> 01:26:02.835
Bloody hypocrite.

01:26:02.875 --> 01:26:04.915
I used to feel guilty
about me and Karen.

01:26:04.955 --> 01:26:06.995
Just don't think that
my being with Jennifer

01:26:07.035 --> 01:26:09.955
lets you off the hook.

01:26:09.995 --> 01:26:10.875
Move over.

01:26:10.915 --> 01:26:12.355
You don't deserve her,
you know that?

01:26:12.395 --> 01:26:13.555
Which one?

01:26:13.595 --> 01:26:14.675
Both. Either.

01:26:14.675 --> 01:26:15.675
Neither do you.

01:26:15.715 --> 01:26:17.635
Tough.
Karen's not going back.

01:26:17.675 --> 01:26:18.555
Like hell she isn't!

01:26:18.595 --> 01:26:20.755
I thought
you wanted Jennifer!

01:26:20.795 --> 01:26:22.875
Give me some!
Give me half!

01:26:22.915 --> 01:26:25.315
Half? You want half?
Who are you, my goddamn wife?

01:26:25.315 --> 01:26:26.755
You want to be
Jennifer's mother, too?

01:26:26.755 --> 01:26:28.195
Stop throwing
Jennifer up to me!

01:26:28.195 --> 01:26:29.595
And you can
stop pretending

01:26:29.635 --> 01:26:31.515
you've got some kind
of moral superiority

01:26:31.555 --> 01:26:32.955
because you are a fraud!

01:26:32.955 --> 01:26:34.875
No wonder you wouldn't
hit me when you found out!

01:26:34.915 --> 01:26:36.315
Still want me
to hit you? Huh?

01:26:36.355 --> 01:26:38.235
Yeah? How about now?

01:26:38.275 --> 01:26:39.635
Fine!

01:26:39.675 --> 01:26:42.075
Get up so I can kill you!

01:26:42.115 --> 01:26:42.995
Aah!

01:26:43.035 --> 01:26:44.435
No biting!

01:26:44.475 --> 01:26:46.875
Hey! Come here!

01:26:46.915 --> 01:26:47.795
Aah!

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:48.755
Jeez! No kicking!

01:26:48.795 --> 01:26:50.235
You can't get rabies
from kicking!

01:26:50.275 --> 01:26:51.915
Aah!

01:26:51.955 --> 01:26:53.555
Let go!

01:26:53.595 --> 01:26:55.035
I'll kill you!

01:26:55.075 --> 01:26:56.715
Shut up!

01:26:56.755 --> 01:26:58.355
Aah!

01:26:58.395 --> 01:26:58.875
Watch it!
Those are my balls

01:26:58.915 --> 01:26:59.795
are you kidding?

01:26:59.835 --> 01:27:03.675
I couldn't find them
with a magnifying glass!

01:27:07.595 --> 01:27:10.955
It was quite simply
the worst night of my life.

01:27:10.995 --> 01:27:12.875
My embarrassment
compounded by the fact

01:27:12.915 --> 01:27:14.755
that Victor
had now slept with

01:27:14.795 --> 01:27:19.115
2 out of the 3 members
of my family.

01:28:00.355 --> 01:28:02.275
Jennifer, I was just
gonna pick you up.

01:28:02.275 --> 01:28:03.955
I got a ride.
Iorenzo drove me.

01:28:03.995 --> 01:28:05.635
You all right?
How do you feel?

01:28:05.635 --> 01:28:07.035
Fine.

01:28:07.075 --> 01:28:08.955
Where'd you meet
lorenzo?

01:28:08.995 --> 01:28:10.915
At the hospital.
Iorenzo!

01:28:10.955 --> 01:28:12.595
He took
wonderful care of me.

01:28:12.635 --> 01:28:14.155
He's studying
to be a doctor.

01:28:14.195 --> 01:28:15.675
I want you
to meet my father.

01:28:15.715 --> 01:28:17.555
Oh.

01:28:17.595 --> 01:28:19.515
It's a great
pleasure, sir.

01:28:19.555 --> 01:28:22.755
Him.

01:28:22.795 --> 01:28:24.235
Get your stuff.
We're going.

01:28:24.275 --> 01:28:25.675
That's what
I wanted to ask you.

01:28:25.675 --> 01:28:26.475
What?

01:28:26.515 --> 01:28:27.715
Can I stay?

01:28:27.755 --> 01:28:28.875
Stay where?

01:28:28.915 --> 01:28:32.275
Here. We still have
the house for another week.

01:28:32.315 --> 01:28:34.395
Nicky'll stay with me,
wouldn't you?

01:28:34.435 --> 01:28:35.795
Could I?

01:28:35.835 --> 01:28:37.755
Are you staying?

01:28:37.795 --> 01:28:38.195
No.

01:28:38.235 --> 01:28:40.115
Then you can stay.

01:28:40.155 --> 01:28:41.555
You don't mind
leaving them alone?

01:28:41.595 --> 01:28:43.995
You mean they might not
behave as well as we did?

01:28:43.995 --> 01:28:45.435
Lorenzo will
look out for us.

01:28:45.435 --> 01:28:47.795
He said he would.

01:28:47.795 --> 01:28:50.315
What the hell do I know
about lorenzo?

01:28:50.355 --> 01:28:51.715
He's 21.

01:28:51.755 --> 01:28:54.115
He's perfect.
I love him.

01:28:54.155 --> 01:28:57.035
Ok, I better go call
the airlines and tell them.

01:28:57.035 --> 01:28:58.715
Victor!

01:28:58.755 --> 01:29:01.635
Come see the house.
It's beautiful. Nicky?

01:29:01.675 --> 01:29:04.075
It all worked out
very neatly...

01:29:04.115 --> 01:29:06.475
except for me,
the odd man out.

01:29:06.515 --> 01:29:09.635
Well, no complaints.
I made my own bed.

01:29:09.675 --> 01:29:15.915
I just never thought
I'd wind up in it alone.

01:29:15.955 --> 01:29:18.715
Uncle Matthew,
you were right, you know.

01:29:18.715 --> 01:29:21.555
I can't imagine
about what.

01:29:21.555 --> 01:29:24.435
That was a dream
I had on the beach

01:29:24.475 --> 01:29:28.275
a beautiful dream.

01:29:33.075 --> 01:29:36.435
Will you forget me

01:29:36.475 --> 01:29:39.795
the minute I die.

01:29:48.235 --> 01:29:49.715
I'm serious.
I don't know when.

01:29:49.755 --> 01:29:52.715
Your own divorce and
you don't know when?

01:29:52.755 --> 01:29:55.235
I can get it tomorrow if I want
to cave in to her lawyers.

01:29:55.275 --> 01:29:57.355
Otherwise,
it's gonna take months.

01:29:57.395 --> 01:29:59.715
Months?

01:29:59.755 --> 01:30:02.315
At least.

01:30:02.355 --> 01:30:04.875
And then?

01:30:04.915 --> 01:30:06.355
It'll be over.
I'll be free.

01:30:06.395 --> 01:30:08.715
Mmm.

01:30:08.755 --> 01:30:12.115
Just about the time
I could be.

01:30:12.155 --> 01:30:13.035
Yeah.

01:30:13.075 --> 01:30:14.475
Careful, Victor.

01:30:14.515 --> 01:30:17.155
Don't let your enthusiasm
run away with you.

01:30:17.195 --> 01:30:19.795
Karen, we don't want
to rush into anything.

01:30:19.835 --> 01:30:22.635
Not a second time,
certainly.

01:30:22.675 --> 01:30:26.675
Don't panic, Victor,
I have no demands.

01:30:26.715 --> 01:30:30.715
We helped each other
through a bad time.

01:30:30.915 --> 01:30:32.595
Can I still see you?

01:30:32.635 --> 01:30:34.075
I don't think so, Victor.

01:30:34.115 --> 01:30:35.955
Why not?

01:30:35.995 --> 01:30:38.315
Your fly is open.

01:30:38.315 --> 01:30:39.715
Not now.

01:30:39.715 --> 01:30:44.035
Just most of the time.

01:30:51.915 --> 01:30:54.315
You going to Sao Paulo

01:30:54.355 --> 01:30:55.715
I guess.

01:30:55.755 --> 01:30:57.675
I'm going to bahía

01:30:57.715 --> 01:30:59.555
it figures.

01:30:59.595 --> 01:31:02.475
My hotel room's
paid for the month.

01:31:02.515 --> 01:31:05.635
Right.
What's Victor up to?

01:31:05.675 --> 01:31:07.435
He's packing.

01:31:07.475 --> 01:31:10.395
Mm-hmm.

01:31:10.435 --> 01:31:14.835
Have you got room
in your bag for these?

01:31:14.875 --> 01:31:16.075
Don't you want them
in bahía?

01:31:16.115 --> 01:31:18.275
They're going to bahía.

01:31:18.275 --> 01:31:22.235
I don't understand.

01:31:22.235 --> 01:31:26.115
You're going to bahía.

01:31:26.155 --> 01:31:28.555
We've got a lot
to talk about, Matthew.

01:31:28.595 --> 01:31:29.755
Do you want to talk?

01:31:29.795 --> 01:31:31.715
You think I want
to throw 20 years away

01:31:31.755 --> 01:31:34.115
just because of
your foolishness?

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:35.475
Or mine?

01:31:35.515 --> 01:31:36.755
Karen-

01:31:36.795 --> 01:31:39.635
it's going to be
a long haul, Matthew.

01:31:39.675 --> 01:31:42.075
There's an awful lot
for both of us to forget.

01:31:42.115 --> 01:31:44.275
Let alone forgive.

01:31:44.315 --> 01:31:45.395
Mm-hmm.

01:31:45.435 --> 01:31:47.595
No more "mmms," Matthew.

01:31:47.635 --> 01:31:49.395
I want you to talk to me.

01:31:49.435 --> 01:31:51.155
Reach down
in your feelings

01:31:51.195 --> 01:31:53.115
and tell me what
you're thinking,

01:31:53.115 --> 01:31:54.035
what you're afraid of.

01:31:54.075 --> 01:31:57.115
I want you to stop
bottling it all up.

01:31:57.155 --> 01:31:58.035
I'll do my best.

01:31:58.075 --> 01:32:01.435
I'll take your worst, too.
Just share with me.

01:32:01.475 --> 01:32:05.955
I'll do my worst.

01:32:05.995 --> 01:32:10.475
We better hurry.

01:32:13.035 --> 01:32:17.155
Victor... wait.

01:32:17.195 --> 01:32:20.395
Come on.

01:32:20.435 --> 01:32:21.835
I'm so glad we got to stay.

01:32:21.875 --> 01:32:24.275
They're coming.
I'm gonna talk to my mom.

01:32:24.315 --> 01:32:25.955
What's happening?

01:32:25.995 --> 01:32:27.595
We're leaving.

01:32:27.635 --> 01:32:30.995
You and mom,
as in together?

01:32:31.035 --> 01:32:34.355
We'll be at club med
in bahía.

01:32:41.035 --> 01:32:42.955
Goodbye, Jennifer.

01:32:42.955 --> 01:32:46.795
Goodbye,
uncle Matthew.

01:32:51.715 --> 01:32:55.995
Nicky, uh...

01:32:56.035 --> 01:33:00.315
I love you, too.

01:33:00.315 --> 01:33:01.755
We've got a lot
to talk about.

01:33:01.795 --> 01:33:03.635
I know.

01:33:03.675 --> 01:33:06.035
I'm so glad
you're leaving

01:33:06.075 --> 01:33:09.915
I'll see you back
in Sao Paulo.

01:33:16.155 --> 01:33:17.595
Goodbye, uncle Victor.

01:33:17.635 --> 01:33:18.515
Goodbye, nick.

01:33:18.555 --> 01:33:21.435
And thanks
for whatever you did.

01:33:21.475 --> 01:33:23.315
I didn't do anything.

01:33:23.355 --> 01:33:29.595
Thank god
somebody didn't.

01:33:29.595 --> 01:33:30.715
Goodbye,
aunt Karen

01:33:30.715 --> 01:33:33.115
goodbye, Jennifer.
Take care of yourself.

01:33:33.155 --> 01:33:36.195
Try not to play
with anything sharp.

01:33:36.235 --> 01:33:39.555
We gotta move.

01:33:42.715 --> 01:33:43.675
What's that?

01:33:43.715 --> 01:33:44.595
Sunglasses.

01:33:44.635 --> 01:33:46.315
The other thing.

01:33:46.355 --> 01:33:47.995
Uh, I-I don't know.

01:33:48.035 --> 01:33:49.395
Nothing.

01:33:49.435 --> 01:33:53.275
And I've heard
all I want out of you.

01:33:53.355 --> 01:33:56.035
Go.

01:33:56.035 --> 01:33:58.035
Terrific.
I wind up being your driver.

01:33:58.075 --> 01:34:00.475
I hope you're better at
that than being a friend.

01:34:00.515 --> 01:34:01.875
You're kidding.
After what you've done

01:34:01.915 --> 01:34:03.835
I don't know how you can
look me in the face.

01:34:03.835 --> 01:34:04.755
Which one, Victor?

01:34:04.795 --> 01:34:06.315
Which face did you
have in mind?

01:34:06.355 --> 01:34:07.235
It's hard to realize

01:34:07.275 --> 01:34:09.675
a whole year has
gone by since then.

01:34:09.715 --> 01:34:11.595
Victor finally
got his divorce,

01:34:11.635 --> 01:34:13.515
then he and his wife
turned around

01:34:13.555 --> 01:34:14.915
and married
each other again.

01:34:14.955 --> 01:34:17.355
Victor said it's because
she wanted to get

01:34:17.355 --> 01:34:19.755
the other half
of everything he owned.

01:34:19.755 --> 01:34:21.155
With Karen and me,

01:34:21.195 --> 01:34:23.555
it wasn't really a case
of happily ever after.

01:34:23.555 --> 01:34:27.035
We were lucky to get any kind
of ever after at all.

01:34:27.075 --> 01:34:30.755
I figure we're a few months
away from happily.

01:34:30.795 --> 01:34:31.995
But we'll make it.

01:34:32.035 --> 01:34:33.115
You only live once,

01:34:33.155 --> 01:34:35.555
but it does help if you
get to be young twice.

01:34:35.595 --> 01:34:38.395
...moonlight on the sea

01:34:38.435 --> 01:34:40.835
might have been
the warm and friendly

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:42.715
feeling everywhere

01:34:42.755 --> 01:34:47.075
but something wild
came over you and me

01:34:47.115 --> 01:34:48.995
and we felt
our inhibitions

01:34:49.035 --> 01:34:51.355
melt away as snow

01:34:51.395 --> 01:34:52.355
though
we tried to fight it

01:34:52.395 --> 01:34:55.195
you and i

01:34:55.235 --> 01:34:56.635
just about the time

01:34:56.675 --> 01:34:58.875
discretion
should have said hello

01:34:58.915 --> 01:35:01.075
we watched
our good intentions

01:35:01.115 --> 01:35:05.835
wave goodbye

01:35:05.875 --> 01:35:08.755
what if we both went
a little bit crazy

01:35:08.795 --> 01:35:10.155
blame it on Rio

01:35:10.195 --> 01:35:12.595
what if our hearts
got a little bit hazy

01:35:12.595 --> 01:35:13.995
blame it on Rio

01:35:14.035 --> 01:35:15.475
what if we
acted like fools

01:35:15.475 --> 01:35:17.395
broke a few rules

01:35:17.435 --> 01:35:22.915
what do we care

01:35:22.955 --> 01:35:28.355
blame it on Rio

01:35:28.395 --> 01:35:31.275
what if we both went
a little bit crazy

01:35:31.315 --> 01:35:32.675
blame it on Rio

01:35:32.715 --> 01:35:35.115
what if our hearts
got a little bit hazy

01:35:35.155 --> 01:35:36.995
blame it on Rio

01:35:37.035 --> 01:35:38.475
what if we acted
like fools

01:35:38.515 --> 01:35:41.355
broke a few rules

01:35:41.395 --> 01:35:44.235
what do we care

01:35:45.305 --> 01:35:51.798
