04:34.520 --> 04:35.590

It is, of course, possible
that it was something else.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.153

very much.

more insight...

07:50.720 --> 07:52.074
And we did.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.396
Hmm.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.673
I wonder if he knew

07:58.560 --> 08:00.392
that his trip to Eros
would be one-way.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.435
I think part of him never left
that terrible little room

08:06.520 --> 08:08.318

wanted to be saved.

We all felt the same.

dangerous thing</i>

12:13.160 --> 12:14.514
<i>about being
in a high-G burn</i>

12:14.600 --> 12:18.150
<i>is that if it goes on
too long, it'll kill you.</i>

12:27.320 --> 12:30.154
So, how is Arjun?

12:31.120 --> 12:32.474
He's fine.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.672
I hear he's been away,
on Luna.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.713
For quite some time.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.318
- This is not a date.
- It's not?

12:44.640 --> 12:47.553
- Those days are gone.
- (CHUCKLES)

12:47.640 --> 12:49.518
Don't be cross with me
for trying.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.518
I asked you to that meeting
to hear your opinion.

12:54.480 --> 12:55.800
You barely said a word.

12:55.920 --> 12:58.992
In that room, my opinion
would have only made me

12:59.080 --> 13:00.639
less popular
than I already am.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.912
You have a different
theory about Eros?

13:03.360 --> 13:04.953
Different, yeah.
More like radical.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.840
This is not a time to keep
these things to yourself.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.312
The problem
with Colonel Janus,

13:10.400 --> 13:12.073
as a scientist, I mean,

13:12.160 --> 13:13.480
his personality disorders
are obvious,

13:13.560 --> 13:17.110
but his problem is that
he lacks imagination.

13:17.240 --> 13:20.119
(CHUCKLES) - It's true.
He can only conceive the world

13:20.200 --> 13:21.839
in terms of things
he's already seen.

13:21.920 --> 13:24.958
His job is to explain
science to politicians.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.475
In that regard,
it's a useful skill.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.517
But it's of no use here.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.592
Eros Station
was under quarantine,

13:31.680 --> 13:35.799
the result of a mysterious
bio-weapon unleashed by Mars,

13:35.880 --> 13:37.712
which Mars believes
was unleashed by us,

13:37.800 --> 13:39.029
which we did not...

13:39.120 --> 13:40.315
Did we?

13:41.040 --> 13:42.394
We did not.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.637
Ah, I never doubted that
for a moment.

13:46.240 --> 13:50.871
Suddenly, Eros,
the entire asteroid, moves...

13:52.080 --> 13:53.878
In a way
that practically defies

13:53.960 --> 13:55.360
every single
known law of physics.

13:55.560 --> 13:59.554
Now, Janus thinks that means
there's a new Martian weapon,

14:00.360 --> 14:03.114
some staggering breakthrough
on an incredible scale

14:03.200 --> 14:04.759
of a technology
they've been pursuing

14:04.920 --> 14:06.912
utterly unsuccessfully
for years.

14:07.360 --> 14:08.919
But ask yourself
this question...

14:09.280 --> 14:11.351
Does it make any sense at all
that Mars would want to

14:11.440 --> 14:13.750
test their groundbreaking
technology

14:13.840 --> 14:15.638
in a biohazard zone,

14:16.960 --> 14:18.758
that they themselves created?

14:18.960 --> 14:20.440
I suppose not.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.678
So what if this bio-weapon
isn't a bio-weapon after all?

14:24.800 --> 14:26.917
What if it is responsible
in some way

14:27.120 --> 14:30.431
we can't yet
fully understand,

14:30.520 --> 14:32.113
for Eros moving?

14:32.960 --> 14:34.713
I believe Eros was infected

14:34.800 --> 14:37.235
by an entirely new order
of technology,

14:37.320 --> 14:39.551
something from
somewhere else,

14:39.640 --> 14:42.280
somewhere beyond
the reach of our species.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.871
I believe the Eros incident

14:45.960 --> 14:48.350
was our first contact
with alien life.

14:50.200 --> 14:54.114
I have a file with
900 pages of analysis,

14:54.200 --> 14:56.795
and contingency plans
for war with Mars,

14:57.480 --> 15:01.076
including 14 different
scenarios about what to do,

15:01.160 --> 15:04.039
if they develop
an unexpected new technology.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.873
My file for what to do

15:06.960 --> 15:10.749
if an advanced alien species
comes calling?

15:10.840 --> 15:12.672
It's three pages long,

15:12.840 --> 15:17.198
and it begins with,
"Step one, find God."

15:18.360 --> 15:20.272
I need to get to Venus.

15:20.640 --> 15:23.075
You can pull the strings
and get me on that ship.

15:23.160 --> 15:25.391
I will be your eyes

15:25.480 --> 15:27.631

16:25.080 --> 16:27.311

don't think like that.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.153
They've filed a lawsuit
over the <i>Nauvoo</i>

I'm in some deep shit.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.196
Well, we have one more thing
for you to worry about.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.437
These aren't rock hopper
mining nukes.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.159
These are planet busters.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.879

16:48.680 --> 16:49.670

picks 'em up,

16:49.760 --> 16:50.989
it could be a problem.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.434
Especially if they're
smart enough

16:52.520 --> 16:53.749
to remove
the countermeasures.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.320
The missiles could be
re-targeted,

16:55.400 --> 16:57.437
and sent right back
at the Inners.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.716
Or anyone else in the system,
for that matter.

This doesn't seem to be
bothering you. Why is that?

17:06.960 --> 17:08.553
Because I've got
the missiles.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.798
DRUMMER: After the UN
gave us guidance control,

17:10.960 --> 17:13.634
our techs were able to lock
out some of the abort codes

17:13.760 --> 17:15.433
and override the drives.

17:16.040 --> 17:17.872
We scooped 'em up and
brought 'em back to Tycho,

17:17.960 --> 17:20.839
inside gas freighters
and ore ships.

17:21.359 --> 17:23.431
We could use some help
removing the countermeasures.

17:26.359 --> 17:28.113
HOLDEN:
What are you planning on doing with them?

17:28.200 --> 17:31.796
Nothing. Sometimes that's
the best plan of action.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.040
The only thing those weapons
are good for is first strike.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.191
Hell, they're good
for a lot of things.

17:37.280 --> 17:38.953
They can be used
as deterrents,

17:39.160 --> 17:40.913
or a bargaining chip.

17:41.240 --> 17:42.390
Earth and Mars
are still in the dark

17:42.480 --> 17:43.994
about the protomolecule.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.799
We need to tell them
everything we know about it.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.680
We need to tell everyone.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.399
And exactly what
should we tell them?

17:49.800 --> 17:52.952
That it's alien technology
that we barely comprehend?

17:53.320 --> 17:55.880
That would cause
a system-wide panic.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.872
Until we get
more information,

17:57.960 --> 17:59.713
we need to keep this
under wraps.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.672
Eros changed everything.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.517
Earth and Mars are scared.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.115
And whenever that happens,
Belters always lose.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.039
Our first priority
is to protect ourselves.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.470
And that means,

18:13.560 --> 18:16.678
we're gonna take advantage
of every edge we've got.

25:10.120 --> 25:11.600
We can give

What?

nasty going on down there,

25:21.280 --> 25:23.112

keep Earth out of it.

have a strategic advantage

25:45.240 --> 25:46.720

someone will.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.270

another Eros or worse.

is to destroy it.
