00:01.970 --> 00:02.948
-FBI, don't move!

00:02.950 --> 00:04.406
-Ronald Reagan doesn't care!

00:10.350 --> 00:12.329
-I'm proud of you, Stan.

00:12.330 --> 00:13.809
-They say they want
to give me a medal.

00:13.810 --> 00:15.016
-Where's your sister?

00:15.020 --> 00:16.499
-She had to stay late at school.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.060
-Thanks for making
this trip fly by.

00:19.070 --> 00:21.994
It always feels better to
have someone to talk to.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.480
-Sit, please.

00:24.490 --> 00:26.583
Lying will not be tolerated.

00:26.590 --> 00:28.296
-Give me a call
when you get back,

00:28.300 --> 00:31.531
if you want to hang out with
other people who get it.

00:31.540 --> 00:32.643
-Kelli?

00:32.650 --> 00:34.732
It's Paige.

00:34.740 --> 00:35.434
You too.

00:35.440 --> 00:36.953
Hey, do you want to hang out?

00:36.960 --> 00:37.938
-And Amelia?

00:37.940 --> 00:39.248
-Ninth grade, cheerleading.

00:39.250 --> 00:40.114
-Oh my god, no.

00:40.120 --> 00:40.814
-Yes!

00:40.820 --> 00:42.538
-Jared's a senior?

00:42.540 --> 00:46.704
-He's going to Carnegie
Mellon next year.

00:46.710 --> 00:47.404
-Emmet?

00:50.880 --> 00:53.735
Paige and Henry, go.

00:53.740 --> 00:55.059
-Who would do this?

00:55.060 --> 00:56.015
-You want the list?

00:56.020 --> 00:57.089
Someone who know us.

00:57.090 --> 00:58.045
Every single one of us.

00:58.050 --> 00:59.995
Someone who_'s onto
the operation.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.979
-How are we going
to live like this?

01:04.950 --> 01:07.692
-He is a brilliant physicist.

01:07.700 --> 01:11.989
And an eloquent advocate
for those Jewish Refuseniks

01:11.990 --> 01:17.189
still trapped in the Soviet
Union, of whom he was once one.

01:17.190 --> 01:20.717
Anton Baklanov.

01:27.300 --> 01:28.415
- Thank you, Rabbi.

01:31.550 --> 01:36.704
The world of physics encompasses
the microscopic, the sub

01:36.710 --> 01:43.274
microscopic, the very distant,
the world of unseen things.

01:43.280 --> 01:47.705
This afternoon I want to talk
about a world of unseen people.

01:47.710 --> 01:52.886
A society in which Jews are
turned into non-persons.

01:52.890 --> 01:57.304
Ten years ago I was luclq enough
to get out of the Soviet Union.

01:57.310 --> 02:00.734
In America, I found a home.

02:00.740 --> 02:10.650
Justice, dignity, baseball,
and freedom for myself,

02:10.660 --> 02:14.107
my beautiful wife,
most of all our son.

02:29.520 --> 02:30.999
-Hey!

02:31.010 --> 02:33.478
Hey, you guys!

02:33.490 --> 02:35.276
This is Paige.

02:35.280 --> 02:35.974
-Hey Paige!

03:02.320 --> 03:04.811
-I was listening to that.

03:04.820 --> 03:05.787
-I know.

03:13.540 --> 03:17.556
-Anton Baklanov would rather die
than betray his new homeland.

03:17.560 --> 03:18.254
-Not recruitable?

03:18.260 --> 03:21.502
-Never will be.

03:21.510 --> 03:24.638
-Any rush?

03:24.640 --> 03:26.949
-I don't see why.

03:26.950 --> 03:28.702
You can take the long
way to work tomorrow.

03:42.150 --> 03:44.118
-Oh, where were you?

03:44.120 --> 03:48.159
-Oh, uh, Emily really needed me,
so I just-- she's got this guy.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.866
He's a junior, soccer captain.

03:49.870 --> 03:51.656
And he thinks he's
God's gift, but I

03:51.660 --> 03:53.161
think that he's just
taking her for granted.

03:53.170 --> 03:53.864
It's just--

03:53.870 --> 03:55.428
-OK, we just-- I'd want
to know where you are.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.453
-Yeah, just all if you're
going to be late next time.

03:57.460 --> 03:59.360
-OK, sorry.

03:59.370 --> 04:00.064
Homework awaits.

04:29.230 --> 04:30.709
-So what's this about a new car?

04:33.380 --> 04:35.200
-Didn't Henry tell you
that-- I'm kidding around.

04:35.210 --> 04:36.689
-Henry doesn't seem to think so.

04:36.690 --> 04:39.272
-You know, Stan's
friend, guys a gold mine.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.236
Got us a Plumber's
UnIon retreat.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.333
I bet we could get
Teamsters, hotel workers--

04:43.340 --> 04:44.967
-We do not need a
new car, Phillip.

04:44.970 --> 04:46.141
---cheaper than a plane.

04:46.150 --> 04:46.844
It's all I'm say--

05:02.610 --> 05:04.669
-I'm glad you're OK.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.363
When I heard about
Emmett and Leann,

05:06.370 --> 05:12.843
I was afraid you might--
well, it's a terrible time.

05:12.850 --> 05:16.229
We need to talk.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.501
-Moscow was signalling
me every hour.

05:48.510 --> 05:50.114
For the first time
I can remember,

05:50.120 --> 05:52.896
I didn't know what to do.

05:52.900 --> 05:53.594
What could I do?

05:53.600 --> 05:54.612
It was done.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.121
-What does the centre know?

05:56.130 --> 05:58.849
-Not much, they're
looking into it,

05:58.850 --> 06:00.977
but they're going to be careful.

06:00.980 --> 06:03.540
-Do they think any of the
rest of us have been exposed?

06:03.550 --> 06:04.938
-They don't know.

06:04.940 --> 06:08.364
Anything's possible.

06:08.370 --> 06:10.031
You're still alive,
that's a good sign.

06:12.620 --> 06:15.248
-They put someone on our
kids, and then pulled them.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.592
-Risk, benefit.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.419
They're scared now.

06:17.430 --> 06:19.409
I've seen it happen before.

06:19.410 --> 06:22.664
They won't do what it takes to
find out what really happened.

06:22.670 --> 06:24.661
And I can't live with that.

06:24.670 --> 06:27.525
-What do you want from us?

06:27.530 --> 06:29.509
-I know it's been
hard between us.

06:29.510 --> 06:32.707
And I'm sorry for
my part of that.

06:32.710 --> 06:37.386
Believe me or don't believe me,
but we need the same thing now.

06:37.390 --> 06:39.358
-And what's that?

06:39.360 --> 06:42.352
-You have to help me find
Emmett and Leann's killer.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.049
-Help you?

06:46.050 --> 06:47.039
Personally?

06:47.040 --> 06:49.201
Without the centre
knownng about It?

06:49.210 --> 06:51.940
-I owe it to Emmett and Leann.

06:51.950 --> 06:53.269
We owe it to them.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.435
I have some ideas who
might have killed them.

07:00.440 --> 07:04.251
Top of the list, Andrew Larrick,
former special operations

07:04.260 --> 07:05.978
in Vietnam.

07:05.980 --> 07:08.266
We believe he is currently
involved in developing

07:08.270 --> 07:11.239
a special mission unit
inside the Naw SEALS.

07:11.240 --> 07:15.085
He teaches at the Naval
War College at Annapolis.

07:15.090 --> 07:16.876
Emmett and Leann were
blackmailing him.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.802
He's homosexual.

07:18.810 --> 07:20.368
He was the only
agent ever running

07:20.370 --> 07:23.339
who might have been good
enough to find them.

07:23.350 --> 07:26.877
To get to Larrick you'll
need an airtight cover.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.862
First step is through
this man, Brad Mullin.

07:30.870 --> 07:36.479
Seaman recruit, working out
of Dam Neck in Virginia Beach.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.118
Elizabeth, the last
time I saw you,

07:38.120 --> 07:42.523
you were just off
an operating table.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.055
I knew you'd live, but I didn't
know if you'd make it back.

07:45.060 --> 07:45.947
-I'm back.

07:45.950 --> 07:49.067
-I'm glad.

07:49.070 --> 07:51.868
I've thought about you a lot.

07:51.880 --> 07:59.286
I-- well, there's no
changing what was.

07:59.290 --> 08:00.382
I'm glad, anyway.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.147
-Commendation day.

08:06.150 --> 08:07.549
Your first?

08:07.550 --> 08:10.098
-Task force in Arkansas
all got medals.

08:10.100 --> 08:11.488
I never picked mine up.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.663
:This one's_a letter
In a very nice box.

08:21.110 --> 08:23.158
-You deserve a commendation
for stopping that bastard,

08:23.160 --> 08:24.001
Agent Beeman.

08:24.010 --> 08:24.704
-Thank you, sir.

08:24.710 --> 08:27.861
-But unfortunately, we don't
hold all the reigns here.

08:27.870 --> 08:30.714
The gentleman from the Soviet
Embassy who had the poor taste

08:30.720 --> 08:34.258
to get his brains blown out
has earned me and the Director

08:34.260 --> 08:37.616
a joint inquiry of the House and
Senate Intelligence committees.

08:37.620 --> 08:38.609
-Shit.

08:38.620 --> 08:40.349
-And we can't hold
them off, Frank.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.351
You'll be next.

08:42.360 --> 08:45.147
-With all due respect,
sir, Agent Gaad

08:45.150 --> 08:47.368
wasn't in any way
responsible for wh--

08:47.380 --> 08:49.086
-Agent Beeman, I don't care
who was and who wasn't.

08:49.090 --> 08:51.877
He was a KGB agent
operating on US soil.

08:51.880 --> 08:55.680
That is a risky
enterprise taking us on.

08:55.690 --> 08:57.669
We understand each other?

08:57.670 --> 08:58.364
-Yes, sir.

08:58.370 --> 09:00.964
-Now will you excuse
us for a minute.

09:00.970 --> 09:01.664
-Certainly.

09:23.460 --> 09:25.337
-We have to do it.

09:25.340 --> 09:27.262
-We're going to live
or die with that woman?

09:27.270 --> 09:28.419
-Or sit and wait?

09:28.420 --> 09:30.229
She wants to know what
happened to Emmett and Leann

09:30.230 --> 09:32.039
as much as we do.

09:32.050 --> 09:34.405
OK?

09:34.410 --> 09:35.251
Brad Mullin--

09:35.260 --> 09:36.204
-Shouldn't be a problem.

09:36.210 --> 09:38.075
-Listen, why don't you
let me handle this.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.937
Mullin's a computer nerd, camera
buff, classical music lover.

09:41.940 --> 09:43.612
There's a million
ways In on this.

09:43.620 --> 09:47.590
-I'|| handle it, but thank you.

11:01.330 --> 11:02.194
-I'll see you tomorrow.

11:02.200 --> 11:02.894
-Goodnight.

11:05.370 --> 11:06.064
-Sir?

11:09.060 --> 11:11.051
Is everything all right?

11:11.060 --> 11:12.823
-Everything's hunlq dory.

11:12.830 --> 11:14.969
I'm being layered.

11:14.980 --> 11:16.140
-Layered?

11:16.150 --> 11:19.210
-Bureaucratese for shoved aside.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.324
They're bringing
someone in over me.

11:21.330 --> 11:24.208
Jim Halliwell from
the Atlanta office.

11:24.210 --> 11:30.297
He'll be running CI until, well,
I guess we don't know when.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.814
-You shouldn't have to
take the fall for this.

11:32.820 --> 11:34.219
-I get no pleasure
from the thought

11:34.220 --> 11:37.121
of taking you down
with me, Stan.

11:37.130 --> 11:43.956
Besides, no offense,
they're after bigger game.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.099
Goodnight, Agent Beeman.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.658
-Goodnight, sir.

12:20.810 --> 12:21.504
-Wow.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.313
-Wo-- yeah.

12:26.320 --> 12:30.302
It's very, um,
actually I hated it.

12:30.310 --> 12:32.005
I don't know anything
about classical music.

12:32.010 --> 12:34.478
-Well, you certainly picked it.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.459
I mean you probably thought,
you know, good ole Beethoven.

12:36.470 --> 12:38.233
Dah-dah-dah-dah.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.832
-Yeah, I did.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.764
I thought it might be
soothing or uplifting,

12:42.770 --> 12:46.399
but, um-- it's very dark.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.960
-Yeah, it's Cortez.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.131
-Is that good?

12:50.140 --> 12:51.072
This?

12:51.080 --> 12:53.719
Oh, no this is great.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.961
This is-- actually,
this is exactly

12:55.970 --> 12:56.823
the thing that you were--

12:56.830 --> 12:58.604
-Are you going to
listen to it right now?

12:58.610 --> 13:00.453
-Oh-- you want to hear it?

13:00.460 --> 13:01.176
Take it.

13:01.180 --> 13:05.219
-No, I meant I could
listen with you.

13:05.220 --> 13:08.018
-With me, like, in the booth.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.476
-Not if you don't want me to.

13:09.480 --> 13:10.731
-No, I do.

13:10.740 --> 13:14.449
I mean, sure if you want
to, that'd be great.

13:14.450 --> 13:17.123
Um, right now?

13:17.130 --> 13:19.360
-Yeah.

13:19.370 --> 13:20.553
-Oh.

13:20.560 --> 13:21.356
OK.

13:21.360 --> 13:22.054
Sure.

13:50.010 --> 13:52.285
-That must be intense.

13:52.290 --> 13:56.010
-When it happens, you
do what you have to do.

13:56.020 --> 13:57.032
It's what we're trained to do.

13:57.040 --> 13:57.734
It's right.

14:00.190 --> 14:05.901
But later on, when
the hoopla's over,

14:05.910 --> 14:07.707
you took a guy off
the face of the earth.

14:13.370 --> 14:15.804
-You ever do it before?

14:15.810 --> 14:16.504
-Yeah.

14:20.410 --> 14:21.809
What's going on with you?

14:21.810 --> 14:25.143
How's work?

14:25.150 --> 14:30.133
-Oh, your friend the plumber has
been opening some doors for us.

14:30.140 --> 14:32.540
-Oh good, I'm glad to hear that.

14:32.550 --> 14:33.790
-I always like to help a friend.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.347
-Well, we appreciate it.

14:35.350 --> 14:37.113
_ It's nice to have a
little extra coming in.

14:37.120 --> 14:40.658
We're thinking about sprucing
up the office a bit-- well,

14:40.660 --> 14:42.639
I am at least.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.050
-I'm having an affair.

14:48.780 --> 14:52.773
I haven't told anybody so you
can't, not even Elizabeth.

14:52.780 --> 14:54.190
-Oh come on, of course.

14:54.200 --> 14:58.057
-I'm, I'm walking around.

14:58.060 --> 14:58.833
It's crazy.

15:05.450 --> 15:07.475
I guess you probably never--

15:11.370 --> 15:13.941
-You think about
it a lot, a lot.

15:13.950 --> 15:18.649
-But in all these years
I've never, never--

15:18.660 --> 15:22.539
-Stan, we're all human.

15:22.550 --> 15:24.279
You know, me and
Elizabeth, we've

15:24.290 --> 15:25.211
been through some patches.

15:25.220 --> 15:25.914
You know that.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.081
-Yeah, no, I know.

15:28.090 --> 15:31.355
-We're solid now, I think.

15:31.360 --> 15:34.716
-Maybe you're
never really solid.

15:34.720 --> 15:38.986
-Yeah, it's hard, marriage.

15:38.990 --> 15:42.505
You know, you love your
wife, and then the day-to-day

15:42.510 --> 15:44.569
crap starts to creep in, and--

15:44.580 --> 15:48.459
-That actually doesn't--
I mean, Sandra and I--

15:48.460 --> 15:51.884
we hardly spend any
time together at all.

15:51.890 --> 15:52.731
-Oh.

15:52.740 --> 15:55.379
-This job takes
its toll, ya know?

15:55.380 --> 15:57.610
There's a lot I
can't share with her.

15:57.620 --> 16:01.090
I wouldn't want to put
her through that anyway.

16:01.100 --> 16:01.896
Separate lives.

16:04.770 --> 16:08.012
I thought moving here
to this post would help,

16:08.020 --> 16:14.448
but actually got worse.

16:14.450 --> 16:16.941
-Sorry.

16:16.950 --> 16:20.078
-And then, you know, I
meet this woman at work.

16:20.090 --> 16:23.901
And she understands what I do.

16:23.910 --> 16:28.028
She sees me in a different way.

16:28.040 --> 16:30.782
-Right.

16:30.790 --> 16:35.170
-Well, you're luclq to be
a travel agent, Phillip.

16:35.180 --> 16:38.069
Happy people go on vacations.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.457
-Yeah.

16:40.460 --> 16:52.554
-This-- when I'm with
this woman, something just

16:52.560 --> 16:53.731
-So what are you going to do?

16:56.190 --> 16:56.884
-I don't know.

17:01.250 --> 17:02.933
There's no way could
ever be together.

17:06.060 --> 17:06.754
-Why not?

17:11.250 --> 17:12.239
-She's married.

17:16.920 --> 17:17.614
We're doomed.

19:16.260 --> 19:17.921
-Yeah, that's all
we need around here,

19:17.930 --> 19:19.170
is something that
makes television

19:19.180 --> 19:20.511
more attractive to kids.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.147
-Yeah, but it makes
us more intelligent.

19:22.150 --> 19:23.469
That's why it's
called Intellivision.

19:23.470 --> 19:26.701
_ -Please tell me we're not_
discussmg Video games again.

19:26.710 --> 19:28.371
-We are, but it's
good for your brain,

19:28.380 --> 19:29.870
and you're not
just sitting there.

19:29.880 --> 19:30.721
You're doing something.

19:30.730 --> 19:31.628
-Go up and get your sister.

19:31.630 --> 19:33.746
You're both going to be late.

19:33.750 --> 19:34.444
-Paige!

19:40.450 --> 19:42.998
-Stan finally told
me about his affair.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.412
-How did that happen?

19:45.420 --> 19:46.387
-We're friends.

19:52.690 --> 19:55.375
We're taking the scientist.

19:55.380 --> 19:56.347
-OK.

19:56.350 --> 19:57.612
-You're in the middle with Brad?

20:00.290 --> 20:02.474
You all right there?

20:02.480 --> 20:03.469
-Of course.

20:06.780 --> 20:07.474
-OK.

21:46.890 --> 21:49.029
-I hope it's OK.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.587
This is the place
that we usually--

21:54.030 --> 21:57.511
-Do you do this a lot?

21:57.520 --> 21:59.499
-You know.

21:59.500 --> 22:00.398
Not a lot.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.669
I've never done this before.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.963
-That's OK.

22:23.970 --> 22:25.631
-I'm kind of a loner really.

22:28.260 --> 22:28.976
-Me too.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.049
-I'm not the usual
military type.

22:33.050 --> 22:36.269
I guess that's obvious.

22:36.270 --> 22:40.252
I wanted to see the world,
but I wound up here.

22:40.260 --> 22:41.830
I'm in the Naw.

22:41.840 --> 22:43.307
I figured, you know,
not everyone, but there

22:43.310 --> 22:45.198
had to at least a couple
of guys I could relate to.

22:45.210 --> 22:45.949
-Mm-hmm.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.633
-There had to be somebody who
wasn't a freakin' Neanderthal.

22:48.640 --> 22:49.811
So I guess the army, right?

22:52.580 --> 22:56.118
-I'm glad you're
not a Neanderthal.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.906
-You're nice.

22:57.910 --> 23:00.674
You know that?

23:00.680 --> 23:03.626
How can you be so nice?

23:03.630 --> 23:07.134
-I'm like you.

23:07.140 --> 23:09.791
I kept thinking I would
meet someone around here.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.449
You know, Navy town.

23:11.460 --> 23:13.826
Think there'd be a
lot of great guys,

23:13.830 --> 23:15.081
but it just didn't work out.

23:17.860 --> 23:22.251
I know, someone who's
sensitive, and generous, kind.

23:27.450 --> 23:28.314
I like you, Brad.

24:08.160 --> 24:11.140
Uh, I'm so sorry.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.129
-What's wrong?

24:13.140 --> 24:19.625
-I-- I don't know.

24:19.630 --> 24:24.943
I really like you, I'm
just having a hard time.

24:24.950 --> 24:27.692
-You want a beer?

24:27.700 --> 24:30.260
-I'm really blowing this.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.340
-No, it's OK.

24:35.520 --> 24:40.173
-Is it OK if we just take
things, kind of, slow?

24:40.180 --> 24:40.874
-Sure.

24:47.590 --> 24:48.284
Oh.

24:54.220 --> 24:59.704
-Would you see me again, or--
I mean, we don't have to,

24:59.710 --> 25:00.540
if you don't want to.

25:00.550 --> 25:01.892
-No, I want to.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.174
-I'm so sorry.

25:03.180 --> 25:10.370
I-- I'll call you.

25:10.380 --> 25:12.359
Nqum

25:12.370 --> 25:13.359
I'll call you.

26:20.730 --> 26:22.334
-It's me.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.079
I'll arrange it.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.004
-So he has a mistress.

26:52.010 --> 26:53.159
George traced the number.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.161
I took a look.

26:54.170 --> 26:56.934
Residential area, quiet
street, deserted at night.

26:56.940 --> 26:59.374
-OK.

26:59.380 --> 27:01.803
I'll go down and check in
on Brad tomorrow morning.

27:01.810 --> 27:04.176
-I have to meet that plumber
first thing in the morning,

27:04.180 --> 27:05.613
Because I have to get
out of Martha's early

27:05.620 --> 27:08.202
'cause I promised
her a lazy morning.

27:08.210 --> 27:09.472
-Lazy morning?

27:09.480 --> 27:12.233
-Yeah, yeah.

27:12.240 --> 27:16.324
-OK, um, so I'll meet
with Claudia for the drop,

27:16.330 --> 27:18.594
and then get home for an early
dinner, and then we'll go.

27:18.600 --> 27:19.919
-OK, good.

27:19.930 --> 27:22.251
How's it going with Brad?

27:22.260 --> 27:23.796
-Fine, piece of cake.

27:40.190 --> 27:41.669
-Don't you knock?

27:41.680 --> 27:43.329
-I did knock.

27:43.330 --> 27:45.958
-Well, I didn't say come in.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.598
-You're right.

27:47.600 --> 27:48.294
I'm sorry.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.482
What is that?

27:53.490 --> 27:54.775
-What?

27:54.780 --> 27:58.125
-You're hiding something.

27:58.130 --> 27:59.119
-A book for school.

28:04.290 --> 28:06.440
-If it's for school
why are you hiding it?

28:06.450 --> 28:08.668
-It's for this course
about the Bible.

28:11.420 --> 28:14.275
-You're not taking a
course on the Bible.

28:14.280 --> 28:15.281
Why are you lying to me?

28:20.290 --> 28:21.473
Paige, what is this?

28:21.480 --> 28:23.016
-I'm reading the Bible.

28:23.020 --> 28:25.124
-What is the Reed Street Church?

28:25.130 --> 28:27.041
-I met this kid, Kelli,
and she's really nice.

28:27.050 --> 28:29.689
And this is where she
goes, like a youth group.

28:29.700 --> 28:31.429
And you know, she's
got a messed up family,

28:31.440 --> 28:32.475
and it makes her happy.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.505
-But you don't have
a messed up family.

28:34.510 --> 28:36.523
-Do we have to talk about this?

28:36.530 --> 28:38.339
-Paige have you
been to this group?

28:38.350 --> 28:39.829
-What's going on?

28:39.840 --> 28:41.796
-Paige thinks she's
in a messed up family.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.449
And she's been going
to some youth group,

28:43.460 --> 28:44.529
she doesn't tell us about.

28:44.530 --> 28:44.655
-You think you're in
a messed up family?

28:44.660 --> 28:46.207
-She doesn't tell us
where she's going.

28:46.210 --> 28:47.234
-Forget I said anything.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.902
-It's not about what you said,
it's that you're lying to us.

28:49.910 --> 28:50.751
Hiding things.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.330
-I'm allowed to
have my own life.

28:52.340 --> 28:53.568
-And we are allowed
to know about it.

28:53.570 --> 28:55.629
-Well, I thought we're supposed
to have privacy in this house.

28:55.640 --> 28:56.937
-This has nothing
to do with privacy.

28:56.940 --> 28:58.567
-Why don't we talk
about this more later?

28:58.570 --> 28:59.275
Huh?

28:59.280 --> 28:59.962
Hm?

29:05.580 --> 29:06.274
-Close the door.

29:16.460 --> 29:18.917
-I'm not saying I thought
you wouldn't call.

29:18.920 --> 29:22.139
I mean, I think
you're a good person.

29:22.150 --> 29:24.527
-That's not why I called.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.998
I want to get to know you.

29:27.010 --> 29:27.704
Thank you.

29:31.890 --> 29:33.209
Where are you from?

29:33.220 --> 29:34.812
-Wyoming.

29:34.820 --> 29:37.038
A dink of a town near Casper.

29:37.050 --> 29:41.305
I know, I don't look
like a cowboy, right?

29:41.310 --> 29:42.538
What about you?

29:42.550 --> 29:50.047
-I, um, I'm, kind
of, from all over.

29:50.050 --> 29:56.671
Navy brat, and my dad, well,
my dad died, and my mom and I

29:56.680 --> 30:00.639
were here, so um, I
just kind of stayed

30:00.650 --> 30:04.142
on, doing secretarial work.

30:04.150 --> 30:05.640
Until um--

30:10.090 --> 30:12.729
-Until what?

30:12.740 --> 30:14.162
-I can't.

30:14.170 --> 30:15.114
Sorry.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.929
-Come on.

30:16.930 --> 30:17.624
You can trust me.

30:27.050 --> 30:35.003
-I-- I was um, attacked.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.615
-What do you mean attacked?

30:43.260 --> 30:45.820
Oh, god.

30:45.830 --> 30:50.221
You were-- Jesus.

30:50.230 --> 30:54.838
Did it-- Was it here in town?

30:54.840 --> 31:01.302
-Um, do you know that bar where
Atlantic, sort of, hits Auburn.

31:01.310 --> 31:02.914
- Yeah,.

31:02.920 --> 31:07.163
-I was in there one night,
and um, was hanging out

31:07.170 --> 31:11.379
with these SEALS, these
big handsome guys.

31:11.380 --> 31:17.683
They were all on leave and then
this one guy-- then he took me

31:17.690 --> 31:20.682
to_ one of those motels
like you took me to.

31:20.690 --> 31:22.373
-Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

31:22.380 --> 31:29.889
-No, no, no, that's not-- I
didn't-- he just got really

31:29.890 --> 31:35.351
mean, and then he- sort
of had me on the ground.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.954
I was flat on my belly.

31:37.960 --> 31:41.771
And he was shoving my
head into the floor.

31:41.780 --> 31:46.296
And then he sort of got
on top of me from behind

31:46.300 --> 31:49.121
and ripped my pants down.

31:49.130 --> 31:57.959
And I-- remember I said no.

31:57.960 --> 31:58.858
No.

31:58.860 --> 31:59.554
-Jesus.

32:02.660 --> 32:04.924
Well, did you go to the police?

32:04.930 --> 32:09.401
-You know, I tried, but
the Naw's protecting him.

32:09.410 --> 32:12.561
They told the cops that he
was not on leave that day.

32:12.570 --> 32:19.601
That, you know, he was on some
secret classified mission.

32:19.610 --> 32:21.896
No one could get
access to his files.

32:21.900 --> 32:24.209
They just sort of buried them.

32:24.220 --> 32:25.585
-Assholes.

32:25.590 --> 32:26.284
-Ugh.

32:26.290 --> 32:27.211
I don't know why I told you.

32:27.220 --> 32:28.790
I'm so sorry.

32:28.800 --> 32:37.970
I-- you just-- seem nice.

32:37.980 --> 32:39.641
And not like the rest of them.

32:43.220 --> 32:45.575
-I'm so sorry.

32:45.580 --> 32:50.415
I wish, I wish, there
was something I could do.

32:50.420 --> 32:51.648
-No, there's nothing.

32:51.660 --> 32:56.142
I-- believe me, I've
tried everything.

32:56.150 --> 32:58.539
But thank you.

32:58.550 --> 32:59.357
-Do you know his name?

33:06.250 --> 33:08.707
-Larrick.

33:08.710 --> 33:11.656
Andrew.

33:11.660 --> 33:16.097
I think he's a
captain or something.

33:16.100 --> 33:19.729
-I know where his files are.

33:19.740 --> 33:20.820
-You do?

33:20.830 --> 33:23.321
-It wouldn't be easy,
but I could get them.

33:23.330 --> 33:25.207
You could give them to a
lawyer, prove he was there.

33:25.210 --> 33:27.189
-No, I wouldn't want you
to do that, because what

33:27.200 --> 33:29.418
if someone saw you taking them?

33:29.420 --> 33:30.853
-I don't have to take them.

33:30.860 --> 33:31.804
I could copy them.

33:36.050 --> 33:36.744
-Nothing much.

33:36.750 --> 33:40.242
We're, uh, we're having a
long, lazy romantic morning.

33:40.250 --> 33:42.980
I know.

33:42.990 --> 33:46.585
You know once in awhile, you and
daddy should just-- no, really.

33:46.590 --> 33:49.343
You should.

33:49.350 --> 33:51.159
Romance is so important.

33:51.160 --> 33:54.061
Could I call you back,
mom, just a couple minutes.

33:54.070 --> 33:57.528
OK, bye.

33:57.530 --> 34:01.136
Hey, why are you all spiffed up?

34:01.140 --> 34:04.530
What happened to our
lazy, romantic morning?

34:04.540 --> 34:05.757
-Thought we had it.

34:05.760 --> 34:06.897
-Um we had the start of it.

34:06.900 --> 34:08.697
-Yeah, and then you got on
the phone with your mother,

34:08.700 --> 34:10.053
like you always do.

34:10.060 --> 34:12.688
-Hey, I thought you
loved my mother.

34:12.690 --> 34:14.794
-Martha, we have so little
time together as it is,

34:14.800 --> 34:16.859
whenever we manage to squeeze
out just a little extra,

34:16.870 --> 34:19.350
you get on the phone
with your mother.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.088
-She called me.

34:20.090 --> 34:22.365
-So tell her to call back.

34:22.370 --> 34:23.962
Why should I sit around
twiddling my thumbs,

34:23.970 --> 34:25.130
while you talk with your mom?

34:25.140 --> 34:26.209
-Twiddling your thumbs?

34:26.220 --> 34:28.040
Is that what you call it
when we're lying here,

34:28.050 --> 34:29.199
cuddly and warm?

34:29.210 --> 34:31.599
-There is nothing for
me to do while you're

34:31.610 --> 34:33.009
on the phone with your mother.

34:33.010 --> 34:35.092
This isn't my home.

34:35.100 --> 34:36.169
-This is your home.

34:36.170 --> 34:37.614
Well, I-- I'm not
going to intrude.

34:37.620 --> 34:38.814
I'm luclq I have
half a sock drawer.

34:38.820 --> 34:39.718
-Do you want a sock drawer?

34:39.720 --> 34:40.778
I can give you a sock drawer.

34:40.780 --> 34:42.657
-No, no, no, no no, go
ahead, call her back.

34:42.660 --> 34:44.127
Don't let me interrupt.

34:44.130 --> 34:44.824
-Clark!

34:50.950 --> 34:52.087
Clark, I'm sorry.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.717
-I can't hear you,
the water's running.

34:53.720 --> 34:55.972
-I said I'm sorry.

34:55.980 --> 34:57.675
I won't do it anymore.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.739
I won't call her while
you're here, I promise.

34:59.750 --> 35:02.514
-Did you wash your hair
in the kitchen sink?

35:02.520 --> 35:04.568
-Well, I guess so.

35:04.570 --> 35:05.798
I always do.

35:05.800 --> 35:08.166
-Well, in the future,
could you not?

35:08.170 --> 35:10.616
Either that, or could you
clean up all these hairs?

35:10.620 --> 35:11.564
-They're my hairs.

35:11.570 --> 35:12.468
You should love me enough--

35:12.470 --> 35:14.028
-You should love me enough
to change something,

35:14.030 --> 35:15.702
if I want it changed.

35:15.710 --> 35:16.404
-Oh my god.

35:16.410 --> 35:17.877
What's gotten into you?

35:17.880 --> 35:18.574
-Oh!

35:18.580 --> 35:22.550
I'm sorry, I just want some
things different around here.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.232
I never get asked what I want.

35:24.240 --> 35:26.435
-How can I ask you anything,
I can't ever find you.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.647
-Find me when I'm here, damn it!

35:28.650 --> 35:32.108
Talk to me, instead of getting
on the phone with your mother.

35:32.110 --> 35:33.065
-You know what I think?

35:33.070 --> 35:35.971
I think that you just want
to leave, like you always do.

35:35.980 --> 35:37.834
I think you got what you
wanted this morning, and now--

35:37.840 --> 35:40.559
-Do not pretend you didn't want
that just as much as I did.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.414
-No, you know what
I wanted Clark.

35:42.420 --> 35:44.843
I wanted a long lazy
romantic morning like the one

35:44.850 --> 35:46.215
that you promised me.

35:46.220 --> 35:46.914
But guess what?

35:46.920 --> 35:48.387
You know, I don't think
I want that anymore.

35:48.390 --> 35:49.084
-Oh, honey.

35:49.090 --> 35:49.920
-Don't honey me.

35:49.930 --> 35:50.862
You know what?

35:50.870 --> 35:51.620
Just go!

35:51.630 --> 35:52.324
Go!

35:52.330 --> 35:55.208
Off to work, dot of
nine, like usual.

35:55.210 --> 35:57.041
Like the time-card
punching, never-around,

35:57.050 --> 35:58.392
pencil-pusher that you are.

36:01.070 --> 36:03.504
-I'm going.

36:03.510 --> 36:05.558
-So go.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.320
-I signalled I didn't
have the files yet.

36:15.330 --> 36:16.445
What are we doing here?

36:16.450 --> 36:18.668
-I know you don't want to
hear this from me, Elizabeth.

36:18.680 --> 36:20.898
But it only takes three
minutes in the car

36:20.900 --> 36:23.573
to know that you
came back to soon.

36:23.580 --> 36:25.229
Bradley Mullin you can
handle in your sleep,

36:25.230 --> 36:28.700
but Andrew Larrick is
waiting around the corner,

36:28.710 --> 36:30.780
and if you're not
ready for him--

36:30.790 --> 36:31.950
-I'll be ready.

36:31.960 --> 36:34.360
-Of course you feel that way.

36:34.370 --> 36:35.655
But I'm telling
you, I see something

36:35.660 --> 36:38.242
that you're not aware of.

36:38.250 --> 36:40.150
You're afraid.

36:40.160 --> 36:41.582
Too afraid.

36:41.590 --> 36:43.808
You're back, but
you're not back.

36:43.810 --> 36:45.892
-I really do think you're
trying to help, Claudia,

36:45.900 --> 36:47.470
but it just takes
three minutes in a car

36:47.480 --> 36:50.119
to know there's something
else going on with you too,

36:50.120 --> 36:51.473
and I want to know what it is.

36:57.470 --> 36:59.950
-I don't want to
lose anyone else.

37:17.800 --> 37:18.494
-Oh!

37:18.500 --> 37:20.525
This is so, so great of you.

37:20.530 --> 37:23.909
_ I can't believe--
is something wrong?

37:23.910 --> 37:24.990
-I don't have the files.

37:27.500 --> 37:28.444
-I don't understand.

37:28.450 --> 37:29.144
1--

37:29.150 --> 37:32.608
-Every time I went to do
it, guys kept looking at me.

37:32.610 --> 37:35.579
I, kind of, chickened out.

37:35.580 --> 37:37.002
-Oh.

37:37.010 --> 37:37.829
-Are you mad at me?

37:37.840 --> 37:39.626
I'm sorry.

37:39.630 --> 37:40.528
-No.

37:40.530 --> 37:41.258
That's OK.

37:41.260 --> 37:46.323
I-- it was a lot to hope for.

37:46.330 --> 37:48.525
I've probably seen too
many movies, you know.

37:48.530 --> 37:54.582
You meet a guy and you think--
ha, you found your hero.

37:54.590 --> 37:56.478
I was stupid.

37:56.490 --> 37:59.152
Who thinks that way?

37:59.160 --> 38:00.957
-It was just so rislq.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.211
I kept thinking this is insane.

38:02.220 --> 38:02.959
I'm going to get shot.

38:02.970 --> 38:05.336
What am I doing this for?

38:05.340 --> 38:06.034
I'm sorry.

38:06.040 --> 38:07.223
It's making me so tense.

38:14.210 --> 38:15.404
-I could help you with that.

38:26.790 --> 38:28.269
-Oh you don't have to.

38:34.220 --> 38:37.189
-That's better right?

38:37.190 --> 38:38.669
That's better.

38:38.670 --> 38:40.365
-Oh, Jesus Christ.

38:40.370 --> 38:41.064
-That's better.

40:00.830 --> 40:01.899
-Here you go.

40:01.910 --> 40:02.592
-Thanks.

40:05.150 --> 40:06.117
OK, so.

40:18.200 --> 40:18.894
-Amen.

40:23.910 --> 40:24.831
Please pass the chicken.

41:13.280 --> 41:14.212
-Clark, are you there?

41:14.220 --> 41:15.141
Pick up.

41:18.430 --> 41:20.500
Your wife.

41:20.510 --> 41:23.479
Who are you?

41:23.480 --> 41:28.656
I know you can't tell me, ever.

41:28.660 --> 41:31.151
We need to talk, Clark.

41:31.160 --> 41:31.854
Call me.

41:53.040 --> 41:54.769
-She was praying, Phillip.

41:54.770 --> 41:56.032
Praying.

41:56.040 --> 41:59.146
If she just wants to say grace,
that's all it is, I think--

41:59.150 --> 41:59.844
-It's not.

41:59.850 --> 42:01.078
This is what happens.

42:01.090 --> 42:02.443
They get them when
they're children,

42:02.450 --> 42:05.385
they indoctrinate them
with friendship, and songs,

42:05.390 --> 42:06.971
and cute boys
cooing about Jesus.

42:06.980 --> 42:07.674
-So?

42:07.680 --> 42:09.136
Maybe it's crush.

42:09.140 --> 42:11.188
-Did you see any signs
of this while I was gone?

42:11.190 --> 42:12.885
-No.

42:12.890 --> 42:14.255
-We haven't been paying
enough attention.

42:14.260 --> 42:15.545
-Yes, we have.

42:15.550 --> 42:17.074
There's been kind of a
lot going on, you know?

42:17.080 --> 42:19.173
-If we'd been paying attention,
this would have happened.

42:19.180 --> 42:20.442
The lying?

42:20.450 --> 42:22.315
-Yeah, that's not like her.

42:22.320 --> 42:24.151
-I mean, you protect
them from the big things

42:24.160 --> 42:26.185
out there, the, the big
life and death dangers,

42:26.190 --> 42:28.750
and then something finds
its way into your house.

42:28.750 --> 42:30.308
-Look, we don't
know anything yet.

42:30.320 --> 42:31.469
Kids go through phases.

42:31.480 --> 42:32.663
Let's keep an eye on it.

42:32.670 --> 42:33.921
-No, that's how this happened.

42:33.930 --> 42:36.740
We let our guard down.

42:36.750 --> 42:40.550
Phillip, you and I
we know who we are.

42:40.560 --> 42:41.538
We have values.

42:41.540 --> 42:44.282
But these kids,
what do they know?

42:44.290 --> 42:44.984
We're failing them.

42:44.990 --> 42:46.082
-We're not failing them.

42:46.090 --> 42:47.682
-We're failing to
help them stand up

42:47.690 --> 42:50.762
to the distractions,
the consumerism.

42:50.770 --> 42:52.351
Look at this country.

42:52.360 --> 42:53.566
Church, synagogue,
I mean, that's

42:53.570 --> 42:54.502
what's holding it all up.

42:54.510 --> 42:56.284
The opiate of the masses.

42:56.290 --> 42:58.815
-Let's eat later tomorrow.

42:58.820 --> 42:59.730
-What?

42:59.740 --> 43:01.014
-We at dinner early tonight.

43:01.020 --> 43:02.840
You don't want to say grace
as much when you're hungry.

43:02.850 --> 43:04.386
-Would you stop
being so reasonable?

43:04.390 --> 43:05.960
We have to do
something about Paige.

43:05.970 --> 43:07.085
-It's going to have to wait.

43:07.090 --> 43:08.182
-It cannot wait.

43:08.190 --> 43:09.157
-Meet Anton.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.631
-Leave your name, a brief
message, and a number where

43:23.640 --> 43:24.937
I can reach you and
I'll call you back.

43:26.070 --> 43:27.230
-Clark, it's me.

43:27.240 --> 43:30.732
You see, this is why I need
to be able to reach you.

43:30.740 --> 43:32.276
I'm filling out
this application,

43:32.280 --> 43:33.827
and there's this
line here, and they

43:33.830 --> 43:36.936
want my marital status,
and my husband's name.

43:36.940 --> 43:38.157
Now I love you
Clark, but I'm not

43:38.160 --> 43:39.718
going to purger myself for you.

43:39.730 --> 43:45.088
And this has to be in tomorrow,
so-- if I don't hear from you,

43:45.100 --> 43:46.874
I just have no choice.

43:46.880 --> 43:48.586
I'm putting your
name down, Clark.

43:48.590 --> 43:50.808
You're my husband
and it's the truth.

43:50.810 --> 43:51.504
Call me!

43:59.460 --> 44:00.154
-It's late.

44:00.160 --> 44:01.149
I gotta get home.

44:01.160 --> 44:01.956
Thank you.

44:01.960 --> 44:02.654
-I know.

44:02.660 --> 44:03.342
Mm.

44:08.440 --> 44:09.134
-Have a good night.

44:09.140 --> 44:09.629
Call me.

44:09.640 --> 44:10.334
-Sleep well.
