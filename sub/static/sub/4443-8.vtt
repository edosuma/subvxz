00:00.258 --> 00:01.947
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.986 --> 00:03.206
Hope you're pacing yourself, Mike.

00:03.222 --> 00:05.185
Dad, I'm gonna miss this
audition. Where are you?

00:05.209 --> 00:06.640
- You were late.
- I'm sorry.

00:06.679 --> 00:07.570
And you stink like booze.

00:07.617 --> 00:09.017
Or maybe I should just tell moms,

00:09.064 --> 00:10.143
who you've been talking to.

00:10.182 --> 00:12.262
I wish I could help, but
I don't have any more.

00:12.301 --> 00:14.155
I mean, there probably is
something at your house,

00:14.202 --> 00:16.587
something that your moms wouldn't
miss. And I could sell it.

00:16.642 --> 00:19.520
I should have realised that
you were never into Brandon.

00:19.559 --> 00:21.545
- He's into you.
- Oh, we're walking home

00:21.576 --> 00:22.484
Why don't you come with us?

00:22.515 --> 00:24.770
- Oh, no. I'm staying.
- Are you sure you're ok?

00:24.804 --> 00:27.539
- I'm great.
- You're not sending me to boarding school.

00:27.574 --> 00:30.542
- I don't know what they told you...
- I'm undocumented.

00:30.577 --> 00:34.413
And so are you. And if you send me
anywhere, I'll call immigration myself.

00:34.447 --> 00:37.583
Stay away from me, stay away
from Sarah, or else you're...

00:37.617 --> 00:39.351
Wyatt, let him go!

00:39.386 --> 00:41.420
I told you to stay out of it
and now you've made it worse.

00:41.454 --> 00:42.588
Fine, I'll stay out of it for good.

00:54.100 --> 00:55.467
Hey, I wanted you to
know I spoke with Bill,

00:55.502 --> 00:58.137
and Sarah has been removed
from the Olmstead's.

00:58.171 --> 01:00.305
And I've got a friend at the DA's office

01:00.340 --> 01:02.207
that I'm talking to about Liam.

01:02.242 --> 01:06.945
I will let you know what happens,
but just wanted you to know.

01:06.980 --> 01:09.181
Ok.

01:09.215 --> 01:10.883
Ok.

01:10.917 --> 01:15.120
Oh, Jesus... I made that from
scratch with really good cheese.

01:15.155 --> 01:18.023
- It's great.
- It's a lost cause, babe.

01:18.992 --> 01:21.760
Somebody pass me the tabasco?

01:21.795 --> 01:23.762
- Oh...
- I'm kidding. Kidding.

01:23.797 --> 01:25.631
I like this.

01:25.665 --> 01:27.733
I got to play this tomorrow
for the grim reaper.

01:27.767 --> 01:29.935
- Grim reaper?
- His music teacher.

01:29.969 --> 01:31.737
He scares the crap out of me.

01:31.771 --> 01:33.972
Hey, miss thing. You know the
rule no phones at the table.

01:34.007 --> 01:36.809
- Brandon has his computer down here.
- I'm studying.

01:36.843 --> 01:39.478
Yeah, right. Me, too.

01:41.915 --> 01:44.550
Before I take that away, what's so funny?

01:44.584 --> 01:46.485
Just this thing that Lexi
sent me. You wouldn't get it.

01:46.519 --> 01:48.654
- Did she just call me old?
- Yep.

01:48.688 --> 01:49.788
Phone, now. Please.

01:51.691 --> 01:54.693
Lexi must be excited, she gets
to come back to school tomorrow.

01:54.727 --> 01:57.429
Her parents are letting her come back?

01:57.464 --> 01:59.531
- That's cool.
- They don't have much of a choice.

01:59.566 --> 02:01.533
Unless they want a visit from immigration.

02:01.568 --> 02:04.570
Blackmailing your parents
isn't anything to be proud of.

02:04.604 --> 02:06.305
No matter how mad she is at them.

02:06.339 --> 02:08.473
They deserved it. I mean,
what was Lexi supposed to do?

02:08.508 --> 02:10.508
Let them send her off to that convent?

02:10.543 --> 02:13.278
- It's a girls' school.
- Same difference.

02:13.313 --> 02:16.281
I just hope they put this all
behind them. They're a family.

02:16.316 --> 02:17.449
In the end, that's all that matters.

02:17.484 --> 02:19.284
All right, who's going to want dessert?

02:19.319 --> 02:21.186
We actually made apple tarts.

02:21.221 --> 02:23.388
If I see ketchup, you're going to die.

02:25.391 --> 02:27.192
Don't forget dinner with
Gretchen tomorrow night.

02:27.227 --> 02:28.360
- Yes.
- You'll finally meet her.

02:28.394 --> 02:30.395
We're going to leave money
for you guys so you can order.

02:30.430 --> 02:32.197
The fabled ex is in town.

02:34.901 --> 02:36.135
Oh, my God, I almost
forgot we have a land line.

02:36.169 --> 02:39.037
- Is that what that is?
- Gretchen? Your ex-girlfriend?

02:39.072 --> 02:40.906
Ooh, the one who hangs
out with movie stars?

02:40.940 --> 02:42.274
- Is she pretty?
- Yeah, she's pretty,

02:42.308 --> 02:44.810
but she's not nearly as pretty as your mom.

02:44.844 --> 02:46.211
Well played, hon.

02:46.246 --> 02:49.882
Can somebody get that?

02:49.916 --> 02:50.975
It's got to be a sales call.

02:50.976 --> 02:53.023
We should just get rid of it.
No one ever uses it anyway.

02:53.119 --> 02:55.954
Hello?

02:57.790 --> 02:59.758
Mariana, it's for you.

02:59.792 --> 03:01.994
If that's Lexi, please tell
her we're still eating dinner.

03:02.829 --> 03:04.530
Hello?

03:04.564 --> 03:06.498
Thinking about having a tart?

03:06.533 --> 03:07.799
Oh, wait. You already have one.

03:07.834 --> 03:10.903
Thank you... anybody else?
Apple tart? Apple tart?

03:10.937 --> 03:13.805
Look, you can't call me here.

03:13.840 --> 03:16.708
What choice do I have?
You just keep ignoring me.

03:16.743 --> 03:19.511
You think it's easy getting to a computer?

03:19.546 --> 03:21.780
If they find out I was talking to you...

03:21.814 --> 03:24.583
Why haven't you answered any of my emails?

03:24.617 --> 03:29.254
Look, I can't give you anymore
money. I don't even have any.

03:29.289 --> 03:32.224
You said, that...

03:32.258 --> 03:34.626
maybe there was something in your
house that wouldn't be missed.

03:34.661 --> 03:39.565
You said that. Look, I'm
not stealing from my mothers.

03:39.599 --> 03:42.134
I'm your mother.

03:43.503 --> 03:48.307
- Look, I'm sorry, but I can't talk.
- Who was that?

04:22.842 --> 04:30.179
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:43.997 --> 04:45.964
Stop. Stop.

04:47.066 --> 04:48.867
Did I do something wrong?

04:48.901 --> 04:53.071
No. But you didn't do
anything right either.

04:53.106 --> 04:58.777
When you were playing just
now, what were you feeling?

04:58.811 --> 05:00.879
Um...

05:00.913 --> 05:04.783
Uh... I don't know.

05:04.817 --> 05:06.852
Exactly.

05:06.886 --> 05:09.988
If playing notes were
all there was to this,

05:10.023 --> 05:12.557
we could program a machine to do it.

05:12.592 --> 05:14.626
I'm just trying to get it right.

05:14.661 --> 05:15.775
And there's your problem.

05:15.776 --> 05:18.399
You have to stop trying to get it right.

05:18.665 --> 05:21.566
I would rather you made a hundred mistakes

05:21.601 --> 05:25.937
than play it perfectly
without... risking anything.

05:27.774 --> 05:31.843
You know, Beethoven started
going deaf when he was 26.

05:31.878 --> 05:34.427
He contemplated suicide.

05:35.228 --> 05:37.238
Imagine the world without
the ninth symphony.

05:37.750 --> 05:40.752
I'd rather not, frankly.

05:40.787 --> 05:44.923
The point is, instead of killing himself,

05:44.957 --> 05:50.696
he used his pain to
create something beautiful.

05:52.865 --> 05:55.967
I don't think I have that much pain.

06:05.945 --> 06:08.780
Thanks for lending this to me.

06:08.815 --> 06:11.883
Big thumbs up to Joan Didion.

06:12.985 --> 06:14.953
Yeah.

06:16.889 --> 06:22.594
I can definitely see what Timothy
meant by her writing was a hostile act.

06:26.532 --> 06:30.402
Speaking of hostile, are you
mad at me about the other day?

06:30.436 --> 06:31.803
'Cause I yelled at you for hitting Liam?

06:35.808 --> 06:40.312
I'm having a little trouble holding up
both ends of this conversation, Wyatt.

06:40.346 --> 06:43.382
What do you want me to say? I
got reamed for protecting you.

06:43.416 --> 06:45.517
Like I was the bad guy or something.

06:47.453 --> 06:51.256
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

06:51.290 --> 06:54.192
It's just...

06:54.227 --> 06:57.396
things with Liam are really complicated.

06:57.430 --> 07:00.198
You're probably right.

07:00.233 --> 07:01.500
It's probably way over my head.

07:01.534 --> 07:04.436
No. No, it's not that.

07:04.470 --> 07:07.339
Liam...

07:07.373 --> 07:09.207
Why don't you go tell Brandon.

07:09.242 --> 07:11.243
You two seem pretty tight.

07:11.277 --> 07:14.346
Wyatt...

07:14.380 --> 07:17.949
there's nothing going on
between me and Brandon.

07:17.984 --> 07:19.985
So, tell me about Liam.

07:21.220 --> 07:24.823
I knew him a couple of years
ago, from an old foster home,

07:24.857 --> 07:27.259
and thankfully, he's out of my life

07:27.293 --> 07:30.796
and I would just like to forget about him.

07:32.231 --> 07:35.934
Wow, you really opened up there.

07:37.870 --> 07:40.105
I thought that's what you liked about me.

07:40.139 --> 07:44.676
That I'm mysterious. A
little bit screwed up...

07:44.710 --> 07:47.946
You know, you might be
a little too screwed up.

07:47.980 --> 07:49.981
Even for me.

08:03.463 --> 08:06.465
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:06.499 --> 08:08.767
Hey, what's up?

08:08.801 --> 08:12.671
Um... I know this is really weird,

08:12.705 --> 08:16.708
but this weekend is... was our anniversary.

08:16.742 --> 08:19.711
Oh. Right.

08:19.745 --> 08:23.682
Um, I... I got these for you a while back

08:23.716 --> 08:26.585
as a surprise before, you know.

08:29.222 --> 08:33.258
- Wow. The weepies.
- I know.

08:33.292 --> 08:37.496
- You should use them.
- Oh...

08:37.530 --> 08:41.131
Yeah, I really can't.

08:41.167 --> 08:44.034
Why not? I want you to.

08:44.070 --> 08:47.205
I just don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

08:47.240 --> 08:50.408
No, I know.

08:50.443 --> 08:53.278
It's not what I meant.

08:53.312 --> 08:56.047
You just loved the band
so much, I want you to go.

08:56.082 --> 08:58.183
Right.

09:00.953 --> 09:03.221
Thank you. Um...

09:03.256 --> 09:05.223
I just can't.

09:05.258 --> 09:07.893
I got plans...

09:10.763 --> 09:12.697
Ok...

09:12.732 --> 09:15.734
I've got to get to class.

09:15.768 --> 09:17.702
Later.

09:29.515 --> 09:31.750
Jesus!

09:31.784 --> 09:33.585
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

09:33.619 --> 09:36.521
I've been looking for you
all day. Where've you been?

09:36.556 --> 09:39.558
Around. I tried to find you at lunch.

09:39.592 --> 09:43.595
Yeah, I had a makeup test for
bio. It was faking impossible.

09:43.629 --> 09:45.463
All that endocrine system stuff?

09:45.498 --> 09:48.700
- I'm pretty sure I failed.
- Uh-huh. Good.

09:50.670 --> 09:52.671
So, you want to hang out?

09:52.705 --> 09:56.207
- You mean, right now?
- Well, yeah.

09:56.242 --> 09:58.543
I can't, I'm sorry. Tomorrow?

10:00.346 --> 10:04.149
Sure. Tomorrow.

10:04.183 --> 10:08.119
Great. I got to go. I'm glad you're back.

10:14.193 --> 10:16.428
Don't let her get to you.

10:16.462 --> 10:18.330
She's not our mom, she's a con artist.

10:18.364 --> 10:21.132
I'm just going to tell
her to leave me alone, ok?

10:21.167 --> 10:23.368
Like you didn't do before
all those other times?

10:23.402 --> 10:25.337
Look, I know what she is, all right?

10:25.371 --> 10:27.205
Even if you don't believe that.

10:27.239 --> 10:30.208
Even if I did believe that I
wouldn't let you come here alone.

10:30.242 --> 10:33.178
This isn't exactly La Jolla.

10:38.184 --> 10:41.252
- This is it.
- Nice.

10:55.101 --> 10:56.901
Are you ok?

10:59.672 --> 11:00.972
You came.

11:06.646 --> 11:11.616
Oh, my God. Jesus...

11:23.648 --> 11:24.348
Can I get you something to drink?

11:25.350 --> 11:28.152
Or maybe something to eat?

11:30.054 --> 11:31.955
No.

11:33.191 --> 11:35.926
- Oh.
- We can't stay.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.928
I was hoping...

11:37.962 --> 11:41.932
We just came to tell you in person
that we can't give you any money.

11:41.966 --> 11:44.701
So, please stop asking and calling.

11:44.736 --> 11:48.906
You don't understand.
It's not what you think.

11:48.940 --> 11:53.043
If you knew... I was trying to
tell you on the phone last night.

11:57.782 --> 12:01.418
Evan, these are my kids.

12:02.620 --> 12:05.789
- Mariana and Jesus.
- I'm out of cigarettes.

12:05.824 --> 12:08.792
- Can you get me some soda?
- You got money?

12:12.430 --> 12:14.298
Later.

12:18.403 --> 12:20.270
Is that your boyfriend?

12:20.305 --> 12:23.240
I don't want him to be.

12:23.274 --> 12:26.477
Not anymore. He's...

12:27.645 --> 12:30.514
If I try to leave...

12:30.548 --> 12:33.183
you see what he's like.

12:33.218 --> 12:37.054
That's why I asked for
money. To get out of here.

12:37.088 --> 12:38.422
I need to get a bus ticket.

12:38.456 --> 12:40.424
I was going to go to San Francisco.

12:40.458 --> 12:41.345
I have a cousin there.

12:41.346 --> 12:43.668
Last time you told me
the money was for rehab.

12:44.195 --> 12:46.230
It was, it was...

12:46.264 --> 12:50.033
but now, I got to get out of town.

12:50.068 --> 12:55.105
He always has drugs, he's always high.

12:55.139 --> 12:59.843
I try to say no, but
he gets so angry at me.

13:01.813 --> 13:03.747
Jesus...

13:03.781 --> 13:05.816
We can't give you money.

13:05.850 --> 13:07.718
I'm sorry.

13:14.759 --> 13:16.894
That's what, your third one today?

13:16.928 --> 13:20.931
No way, mom. I can hold my coffee.

13:20.965 --> 13:23.901
You look like hell, Mike. What's going on?

13:25.737 --> 13:27.571
Nothing.

13:27.605 --> 13:31.742
I've just been working extra shifts
to pay for Brandon's piano lessons.

13:31.776 --> 13:33.744
Not easy being a patron of the arts.

13:33.778 --> 13:35.879
I'm just tired, that's all.

13:35.914 --> 13:37.026
You sure about that?

13:37.027 --> 13:39.649
Because at Mariana's
quinceanera you got so loaded.

13:41.753 --> 13:44.555
Ok, that doesn't work.

13:50.628 --> 13:52.462
Dispatch. This is two adam twenty.

13:52.497 --> 13:54.631
We are code 6 at Oak and Talmadge.

13:54.666 --> 13:59.536
3-Paul-Charles-Ida-2-9-4.

13:59.571 --> 14:02.472
Two adam twenty, be advised. Code 6 Sam.

14:02.507 --> 14:04.141
10-4.

14:06.511 --> 14:09.112
What idiot steals a car then runs
a stop sign in front of a cop.

14:09.147 --> 14:11.982
We're not dealing with Einstein here.

14:15.053 --> 14:16.353
Put your hands on the
wheel where I can see them!

14:16.387 --> 14:18.989
- Is something wrong?
- Turn the car off!

14:19.023 --> 14:23.994
With your left hand, put the
keys on the roof of the car.

14:24.028 --> 14:26.863
With that same hand, open
the door from the outside.

14:26.898 --> 14:31.001
Get out! Put your hands on
your head. Face away from me.

14:31.035 --> 14:33.904
Hey man, I just blew through a stop sign.

14:33.938 --> 14:36.974
Want my advice?

14:37.008 --> 14:38.976
Don't talk.

14:39.010 --> 14:41.078
Damn it, Mike!

14:44.849 --> 14:45.949
Stop!

14:54.659 --> 14:56.593
I said, stop!

14:56.628 --> 14:59.596
Get... down!

15:03.568 --> 15:08.472
- Stef...
- Mike, a little advice. Don't talk.

15:17.782 --> 15:19.583
Just checking in.

15:19.617 --> 15:23.687
You seemed kind of...
you know, this afternoon.

15:23.721 --> 15:27.190
I don't need a whole speech on
what a user our birth mother is.

15:27.225 --> 15:30.327
She knows what to say.

15:30.361 --> 15:32.095
She makes stuff up, Jesus.

15:32.130 --> 15:34.097
She didn't make up that
skeezy ass boyfriend.

15:34.132 --> 15:36.299
What? You think if we
give her money for bus fare

15:36.334 --> 15:38.135
she's really going to buy a ticket?

15:38.169 --> 15:39.469
I told her no money, didn't I?

15:39.504 --> 15:42.406
- Did you mean it?
- Yeah.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.341
That doesn't mean I can't feel bad for her.

16:17.909 --> 16:20.777
Ah-ha, I really hear the difference, babe.

16:20.812 --> 16:23.547
Your teacher's good, huh?

16:23.581 --> 16:24.915
I guess.

16:24.949 --> 16:28.785
Well, that's very nice of your
dad to pay for those lessons.

16:28.820 --> 16:30.721
I hope you let him know
how much you appreciate it.

16:30.755 --> 16:34.791
Yes, I do. I tell him all the time.

16:34.826 --> 16:39.563
How is he doing, your old dad?

16:39.597 --> 16:42.466
You spend more time with him than I do.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.668
Yeah, but we're on duty. That's different.

16:44.702 --> 16:46.570
He just seems a little off these days.

16:46.604 --> 16:49.706
I mean, I know that you had to drive
him home from Mariana's party, yes?

16:49.741 --> 16:53.143
He was hung-over when he picked me
up for my audition with Marshall.

16:53.177 --> 16:58.548
Yeah, so, if you're asking
me if he's drinking again...

16:58.583 --> 17:00.450
Yes.

17:00.485 --> 17:04.054
You said "drinking again."

17:04.088 --> 17:05.387
You knew he was drinking before?

17:05.423 --> 17:09.192
- Yeah.
- When?

17:10.328 --> 17:13.029
The divorce.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.903
But you were little. You can't...

17:19.936 --> 17:22.906
I heard you guys fighting.

17:26.911 --> 17:30.013
I'm very sorry...

17:30.047 --> 17:32.082
I should've never let that happen.

17:32.116 --> 17:36.686
No, that's ok, mom. I
would've known anyway.

17:36.721 --> 17:38.722
- I mean...
- What?

17:38.756 --> 17:41.892
- No, nothing...
- What, Brandon?

17:41.926 --> 17:46.563
One time, he sort of...

17:46.597 --> 17:48.765
drove off the road with me in the car.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.769
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I was afraid to.

17:52.804 --> 17:54.671
Did you tell you to keep quiet about this?

17:54.705 --> 17:57.674
No, I was afraid if you knew,

17:57.708 --> 18:00.777
that you wouldn't let me see him again.

18:08.719 --> 18:10.654
That's why.

18:18.496 --> 18:21.131
What happened out there yesterday?

18:21.165 --> 18:23.266
The suspect broke the hold
and took off running...

18:23.301 --> 18:26.069
Yeah, I can read, officer.

18:26.103 --> 18:28.205
I me, how did you let this happen?

18:28.239 --> 18:32.943
You know, you're damn lucky he
ran instead of grabbing Mike's gun.

18:32.977 --> 18:36.947
It was my fault, Captain. I
thought I had better control of him.

18:36.981 --> 18:39.015
We had no reason to suspect
that he would resist.

18:39.050 --> 18:41.184
- He was cooperative.
- That's just beautiful.

18:41.219 --> 18:43.854
You two done having each other's backs?

18:45.056 --> 18:47.824
Mike, you can leave.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.035
All right, I want the truth.
What is going on with him?

18:59.070 --> 19:00.871
Is he drinking again?

19:16.230 --> 19:18.231
Ok, everybody, I have to run to the office.

19:18.266 --> 19:20.968
You have plenty to keep you busy.

19:26.174 --> 19:28.141
Again, let's see it again.

19:30.345 --> 19:32.946
What's so funny, Garner?

19:32.981 --> 19:35.148
You want to see?

19:45.059 --> 19:50.931
Woo! You're recording this?

19:50.965 --> 19:55.002
Oh, my God! I spilled.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.706
Wait, wait. Here it goes again.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.012
- Hey!
- You're a douche, Garner.

20:09.817 --> 20:11.718
Talya, wait up.

20:11.753 --> 20:14.921
- Are you ok?
- Do I look ok?

20:14.956 --> 20:19.393
Look, Talya, all of this will
be old news before you know it.

20:19.427 --> 20:22.429
Tomorrow, kelsey will fall
on her butt in the quad,

20:22.463 --> 20:24.731
or someone will throw up in the fountain,

20:24.766 --> 20:26.800
and everyone will forget about this.

20:26.834 --> 20:30.404
- It's easy for you to say.
- No, I know what it's like

20:30.438 --> 20:32.539
when everyone's looking at you weird,

20:32.573 --> 20:35.242
whispering about you after you walk by.

20:35.276 --> 20:38.178
It sucks. Big time.

20:39.580 --> 20:45.118
- But you get over it.
- I have to fix my make-up.

20:50.024 --> 20:53.060
- Well, thanks a lot.
- What?

20:53.094 --> 20:56.029
You just got a new partner
until further notice.

20:56.064 --> 20:58.265
Why, what's going on?

20:58.299 --> 20:59.966
Oh, come on, Stef.

21:00.001 --> 21:02.069
You told Roberts I was drinking.
She put me on desk duty.

21:02.103 --> 21:04.971
- I never said you were drinking.
- You didn't say I wasn't.

21:05.006 --> 21:06.239
I'm not going to lie for you, Mike.

21:06.274 --> 21:08.075
The truth is you are drinking.

21:08.109 --> 21:10.844
- The quinceanera? You were drinking.
- That was a party.

21:10.878 --> 21:12.813
Was it a party last night?
The night before that?

21:12.847 --> 21:14.981
Wow.

21:15.016 --> 21:16.950
Everybody has a drink after work, Stef.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.820
No, Mike, everybody doesn't.

21:19.854 --> 21:21.855
Have I ever come to work drunk?

21:21.889 --> 21:25.625
Wow. That's a pretty low
bar you're setting there.

21:28.730 --> 21:30.964
Want another partner? Guess you got one.

21:36.604 --> 21:39.740
I love your necklace. It's
thai, isn't it? Mango wood.

21:39.774 --> 21:43.477
If you say so, you're the world traveler.

21:43.511 --> 21:46.480
- Stef bought it for me.
- Smart move meeting your ex.

21:46.514 --> 21:49.649
- You want to make a statement.
- Oh, don't flatter yourself.

21:49.684 --> 21:51.551
Oh, come on, I meant your wife.

21:51.586 --> 21:55.522
Don't worry, she will be here.

21:55.556 --> 21:59.259
Now tell me, how long have
you guys been together?

21:59.293 --> 22:03.196
- Ten years.
- Wow. Two kids.

22:03.231 --> 22:05.198
Three. One from her marriage...

22:05.233 --> 22:07.234
To a man...

22:07.268 --> 22:12.272
And the twins, who we
fost-adopted when they were five.

22:12.306 --> 22:14.407
And we are fostering a couple more.

22:14.442 --> 22:17.177
Why didn't you ever get
pregnant? You always wanted kids.

22:17.211 --> 22:21.381
- And I have them.
- Right. Of course.

22:23.284 --> 22:28.054
Oh, oh... either your wife is here,
or there's a bachelor party going on.

22:29.323 --> 22:31.892
I am so sorry, honey. I got stuck at work.

22:31.926 --> 22:33.994
- You didn't have time to change?
- I'm Gretchen,

22:34.028 --> 22:35.862
and I happen to like a lady in uniform.

22:35.897 --> 22:37.898
- Why, thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:37.932 --> 22:41.034
- You look like you could use a drink.
- You have no idea.

22:41.068 --> 22:42.803
You can't drink in uniform.

22:42.837 --> 22:45.939
Who says I'm staying in uniform?
I'll have a Martini, please.

22:45.973 --> 22:47.674
- How do you like it?
- Dirty.

22:47.708 --> 22:50.977
Ooh, I knew I was going to
like you. Make that two, please.

22:51.012 --> 22:52.746
And for you?

22:52.780 --> 22:54.848
I'll have whatever red you
have by the glass, please.

22:54.882 --> 22:57.684
Pinot. She can't handle
anything full bodied.

22:57.718 --> 22:58.952
Oh, I don't know about that.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.588
Loving you.

23:01.622 --> 23:04.591
But remember how sick you
got on that Bordeaux in Paris?

23:04.625 --> 23:08.895
She threw up in the Concorde
fountain, it was très romantique.

23:08.930 --> 23:12.866
- Never heard that story.
- I got a lot of stories about our lovely Lena.

23:12.900 --> 23:16.403
- So, enough about me.
- Oh, I'm getting the look.

23:16.437 --> 23:18.772
- What look?
- Oh, you know, the look that says,

23:18.806 --> 23:21.474
- "proceed with caution."
- I don't have a look.

23:21.509 --> 23:24.344
You have a look, honey.
The left eyebrow goes up.

23:24.378 --> 23:25.545
And her posture get very...

23:25.580 --> 23:27.781
- ... Regal.
- Like that.

23:27.815 --> 23:31.751
It's one of the many
things I love about you.

23:39.493 --> 23:40.727
Where is everyone?

23:40.761 --> 23:43.496
Your moms are at that
dinner and everyone else ate.

23:43.531 --> 23:45.432
You might want to warm that.

23:45.466 --> 23:47.200
Oh.

23:51.305 --> 23:54.140
That was pretty bad today,
what happened in algebra.

23:54.175 --> 23:56.476
Well...

23:56.510 --> 24:01.147
Hey, maybe you should cut Talya a break.

24:01.182 --> 24:05.051
Are you serious? Where is this coming from?

24:05.086 --> 24:07.087
I don't know. She apologized...

24:07.121 --> 24:09.356
But the journal wasn't the
only reason I broke up with her.

24:09.390 --> 24:11.324
I mean, she turned into
a whiny, jealous mess.

24:11.359 --> 24:14.127
Maybe she had a right to be jealous.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.363
Ok, well, that doesn't explain the video.

24:16.397 --> 24:20.233
She got drunk because
she felt really stupid.

24:20.268 --> 24:24.237
She saw me with Wyatt, and I don't
know, she thinks we're together.

24:24.272 --> 24:28.975
She just realized that
she had it all wrong.

24:29.010 --> 24:30.977
Did she?

24:32.847 --> 24:36.149
I mean, are you with Wyatt?

24:36.183 --> 24:41.021
I don't know. Maybe... not really.

24:41.055 --> 24:44.157
Then why would she think that?

24:47.128 --> 24:48.995
Your pizza's ready.

24:59.553 --> 25:04.123
- Thank you.
- So, have you ever shot someone?

25:04.158 --> 25:05.525
Oh, luckily I haven't had to, no.

25:05.559 --> 25:08.328
What do you do with your gun
at home? With the kids and all.

25:08.362 --> 25:10.496
- Oh, I lock it up.
- Can we change the subject?

25:10.531 --> 25:13.066
- She hates guns.
- I know.

25:13.100 --> 25:15.001
She doesn't like to talk about my work.

25:15.035 --> 25:16.436
I can't believe she agreed to date you.

25:16.470 --> 25:19.072
- I took her home for Christmas one year...
- Please, not that story.

25:19.106 --> 25:20.306
Oh come on, it's a sweet story.

25:20.341 --> 25:22.419
- My dad's a hunter.
- Oh no.

25:22.420 --> 25:23.767
Made us go to the shooting range...

25:23.769 --> 25:26.145
Lena got one shooff, burst into tears.

25:26.180 --> 25:29.415
- I swear.
- Oh, sweetheart. I'm so sorry.

25:29.450 --> 25:32.118
No rush. Any time you're ready.

25:32.152 --> 25:34.220
- Thank you...
- No, no, no. I insist.

25:34.254 --> 25:36.889
I invited you guys. You're my guests.

25:36.924 --> 25:38.291
- Next time is on us then.
- Great.

25:38.325 --> 25:40.994
As long as it's not
another 10 years from now.

25:41.028 --> 25:43.196
- How long are you here for?
- Couple of days.

25:43.230 --> 25:45.098
Why don't you have dinner
with us tomorrow night?

25:46.033 --> 25:47.834
Absolutely.

25:47.868 --> 25:50.970
- You can meet the kids.
- Yeah.

25:52.039 --> 25:53.973
Yeah? Sure you're not sick of me?

25:54.008 --> 25:55.108
Not at all.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.781
Hey...

26:01.980 --> 26:04.949
No, you can't copy my history homework.

26:04.983 --> 26:06.851
And I've got a ton left to do here.

26:06.885 --> 26:09.854
So, you talk. I'll pretend to listen.

26:09.888 --> 26:13.891
I just wanted to say you were
100 percent right about Ana.

26:16.028 --> 26:19.931
Ok. You must want something.

26:19.965 --> 26:21.695
We can't give her money, but

26:22.660 --> 26:24.475
maybe we can help her get
into a women's shelter.

26:24.736 --> 26:25.903
I found a list of them.

26:25.938 --> 26:28.706
- No.
- They're free.

26:28.740 --> 26:30.675
We take her there and drop her off.

26:30.709 --> 26:33.678
And then she'll say she
needs money to live on.

26:33.712 --> 26:36.681
For toothpaste or food. Or whatever.

26:36.715 --> 26:40.484
Only she won't buy food with it.

26:42.487 --> 26:44.622
This is what she does.

26:44.656 --> 26:48.693
She gets in your head and
makes you feel bad for her.

26:48.727 --> 26:53.331
And then she uses you.

26:54.766 --> 26:57.635
We can never go back to that house again.

26:57.669 --> 27:00.438
Okay? You have to promise me.

27:00.472 --> 27:02.673
I promise.

27:09.481 --> 27:11.482
- That was delicious!
- Right?

27:11.516 --> 27:14.352
Thank you again, that was very generous.

27:14.386 --> 27:16.487
Oh, I'm expecting a
gourmet meal tomorrow night.

27:16.521 --> 27:19.557
- I can't promise gourmet.
- Oh, Lena's a good cook.

27:19.591 --> 27:21.392
Mm-hm. Just don't let her make pot roast.

27:21.426 --> 27:23.527
Oh, I sense another story.

27:23.562 --> 27:25.429
I think we've had enough
stories for one night.

27:25.464 --> 27:30.268
Ah, this is me. I will see you tomorrow.

27:30.302 --> 27:33.104
Goodbye. Nice to meet you. Be safe.

27:35.507 --> 27:39.110
- What's wrong?
- Did you have to invite her over?

27:39.144 --> 27:41.045
She's going to come meet the kids.

27:41.079 --> 27:43.114
She just bought us a very expensive meal.

27:43.148 --> 27:44.282
Money is easy for Gretchen.

27:44.316 --> 27:48.052
Ok, she's your ex. I was
just trying to be nice.

27:48.086 --> 27:49.220
You were kind of ganging up on me.

27:49.254 --> 27:52.290
- What are you talking about?
- "The look?"

27:52.324 --> 27:56.193
- What? You have a look.
- This is why I don't hang out with exes.

27:56.228 --> 28:00.932
Well... she was a little
"fabulous" but I like her.

28:00.966 --> 28:02.199
And no one was ganging up on you.

28:02.234 --> 28:04.201
It doesn't bother you that we were together

28:04.236 --> 28:06.804
for 18 months over a decade ago,

28:06.838 --> 28:08.172
and she acts like she
knows me better than you?

28:08.206 --> 28:11.108
No, because she doesn't.

28:11.143 --> 28:14.745
Come on, it's an ex thing. "I
had her first." Mike does it, too.

28:17.983 --> 28:20.051
You look beautiful.

28:29.761 --> 28:31.862
Uh, she said you're going to pay for it.

28:31.897 --> 28:34.699
You're telling me.

28:53.885 --> 28:56.587
Funny.

28:56.621 --> 28:58.689
That's for not telling me
why you blew me off yesterday.

28:58.724 --> 29:01.759
Mariana says you guys went
to go see your birth mom.

29:01.793 --> 29:05.663
Which is cool. As long as that's the
only reason you've been avoiding me.

29:05.697 --> 29:08.666
- I have not been avoiding you.
- You sure about that?

29:08.700 --> 29:12.536
Yeah, I just... I got a
lot on my mind right now.

29:12.571 --> 29:14.505
What's going on?

29:14.539 --> 29:16.574
Why are you acting so weird?

29:16.608 --> 29:19.577
Because your parents found out about us?

29:19.611 --> 29:22.613
No, it's because I found out about them.

29:22.647 --> 29:26.584
- And about me.
- Lexi, you're as American as I am.

29:26.618 --> 29:29.253
I still feel the same about
you. Nothing's changed.

29:29.287 --> 29:31.222
Everything's changed.

29:31.256 --> 29:34.392
Every time I see a police car,
I can barely catch my breath.

29:34.426 --> 29:37.361
Hey. I'm not going to let
anything bad happen to you.

29:37.396 --> 29:40.531
- I promise.
- That's sweet.

29:40.565 --> 29:44.168
But that's not really
a promise you can keep.

29:46.171 --> 29:49.306
I just feel so freaking alone.

29:49.341 --> 29:50.199
You're not alone.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.533
You've got your parents,
you've got Mariana...

29:53.045 --> 29:54.478
You've got me.

30:03.321 --> 30:05.389
Hey.

30:09.161 --> 30:13.164
Peace, ok? You're like my only friend here,

30:13.198 --> 30:15.166
so you kind of have to talk to me...

30:15.200 --> 30:18.235
whether you like it or not.

30:18.270 --> 30:21.138
That's progress. Excellent.

30:23.108 --> 30:28.913
Um... I have to see this silent film
at the Luxe for my photography class.

30:28.947 --> 30:32.216
Do you want to go with me?

30:32.250 --> 30:34.952
Can't talk during the movie,
so it'll be just like now.

30:34.986 --> 30:37.922
I can't. I have a thing.

30:37.956 --> 30:41.692
Ok.

30:41.726 --> 30:46.831
Well, when your thing gets
boring, you know where to find me.

31:08.620 --> 31:12.556
- Yeah?
- Hey. Is Ana here?

31:15.271 --> 31:15.304
You know Justin Timberlake?

31:17.240 --> 31:18.407
- Mmhm.
- Oh, my God!

31:18.441 --> 31:21.310
George Clooney asked me
to show him around Beijing.

31:21.344 --> 31:24.413
I do a lot of business there,
so I'm a great tour guide.

31:24.447 --> 31:28.050
Ok, wait a minute. You know George Clooney?

31:28.084 --> 31:31.119
We almost died together in the Sudan.

31:31.154 --> 31:35.090
We were in one of those dinky
little planes and we hit a windstorm.

31:35.124 --> 31:39.328
You haven't lived until George
has passed out in your lap.

31:39.362 --> 31:42.998
- Nice.
- Why are you lying to me right now?

31:43.032 --> 31:45.801
Your mom knows famous people, too.

31:45.835 --> 31:48.103
We had dinner with Clinton
in Angkor Wat. Remember?

31:48.137 --> 31:50.172
- Clinton. Really?
- Don't get too excited.

31:50.206 --> 31:52.808
It was Bill, not Hillary.

31:52.842 --> 31:54.810
Hey, your mom and I traveled, too.

31:54.844 --> 31:56.945
Remember that night we spent in Barstow?

31:56.980 --> 32:00.148
How could I forget? My birthday
weekend, greasy cheeseburgers,

32:00.183 --> 32:03.752
a roach infested motel, and
a two dollar bottle prosecco.

32:03.786 --> 32:05.153
Only the best for you, my love.

32:05.188 --> 32:06.889
Oh...

32:06.923 --> 32:10.058
Oh, Jesus wants to know if he
can go to a movie with Lexi.

32:10.093 --> 32:11.793
Yeah, as long as he's home for curfew.

32:11.828 --> 32:14.730
- Oh, I won't get to meet him?
- It's Friday night.

32:14.764 --> 32:16.765
And I'm the only single one in the house.

32:16.799 --> 32:18.700
That's not true. Brandon is single, too.

32:18.735 --> 32:22.571
I don't know about that. He just went
to that concert tonight with Talya.

32:22.605 --> 32:24.773
So, that's back on?

32:24.807 --> 32:26.642
I guess so.

32:26.676 --> 32:28.877
What about you? Do you have a girlfriend?

32:28.912 --> 32:31.680
A few. I like to play the field.

32:31.714 --> 32:33.715
Although, I must say,

32:33.750 --> 32:38.553
your moms do make marriage
look almost bearable.

32:38.588 --> 32:40.622
Well, they're not actually married.

32:41.858 --> 32:45.427
Really? You didn't do it
when it was legal before?

32:45.461 --> 32:47.284
Stef, here, doesn't
believe in gay marriage.

32:47.290 --> 32:48.022
That's not true.

32:48.023 --> 32:52.019
I believe marriage is a state
of mind, not a matter of state.

32:52.368 --> 32:54.303
But you were married to Mike.

32:54.337 --> 32:55.537
Look how that turned out.

32:55.571 --> 32:57.673
Because you're gay.

33:00.510 --> 33:03.378
We're domestic partners.

33:03.413 --> 33:06.348
- That's the same thing.
- Is it?

33:06.382 --> 33:09.351
Well, if it were, why all the
fuss about marriage equality?

33:09.385 --> 33:12.254
No, that's just not that important to us.

33:12.288 --> 33:13.622
It's important to Lena.

33:13.656 --> 33:17.426
Unless you've changed your
mind since we were together.

33:19.162 --> 33:22.297
I'm going to go check
on those cornish hens.

33:22.332 --> 33:24.499
Mariana, would you please set the table?

33:55.131 --> 33:57.099
You got Jesus. Talk to me.

33:57.133 --> 34:00.102
Hey, I know you're not with Lexi.

34:00.136 --> 34:02.871
You better not be at Ana's.

34:02.905 --> 34:04.172
Call me.

34:25.928 --> 34:30.866
Mm. Maybe not gourmet,
but that was delicious.

34:30.900 --> 34:32.701
I never knew you could cook.

34:32.735 --> 34:35.937
Mm. So, people do change, obviously.

34:35.972 --> 34:38.607
I get the feeling that you
haven't. Changed that much.

34:38.641 --> 34:40.708
- Can I be excused?
- Sure, honey.

34:40.743 --> 34:44.545
I don't know... I used to say
that I would never settle down,

34:44.580 --> 34:46.152
but lately I've been thinking
if I met the right person...

34:46.159 --> 34:47.583
Well, that is a change.

34:47.583 --> 34:49.259
Lena broke up with me
because I wouldn't marry her.

34:49.552 --> 34:51.920
That is not true. It wasn't
even legal anywhere back then.

34:51.954 --> 34:54.623
But you wanted a wedding.

34:54.657 --> 34:57.759
You wanted a wedding?

34:57.794 --> 35:00.662
I broke up with you because
you weren't monogamous.

35:00.696 --> 35:02.440
- Yeah, there was that.
- And you slept with my best friend.

35:02.441 --> 35:03.634
And that. But, look, now,

35:03.635 --> 35:06.032
I'm willing to walk down
the aisle and you're not.

35:05.935 --> 35:08.804
- How did that happen?
- I don't need a piece of paper and a ceremony

35:08.838 --> 35:12.507
- to prove our love and commitment.
- But you would like it.

35:13.810 --> 35:16.678
- Sure.
- Really? Why is this the first I'm hearing of it?

35:16.712 --> 35:19.514
You made it clear that you never
wanted to get married again.

35:19.549 --> 35:21.650
And I was under the impression
it wasn't important to you.

35:21.684 --> 35:23.652
Look, I didn't mean to
open a can of worms...

35:23.686 --> 35:26.455
Didn't you?

35:30.526 --> 35:35.464
You know, I have an early
flight, maybe I should go.

35:38.401 --> 35:40.535
Ok...

35:40.570 --> 35:43.238
Well, thank you for dinner.

35:45.541 --> 35:49.244
And it was great to meet you.

35:49.278 --> 35:51.346
Nice meeting you.

35:52.381 --> 35:54.516
I'll walk you out.

36:01.557 --> 36:03.525
... Talk to me.

36:03.559 --> 36:06.228
Ok, now I'm totally freaking out.

36:06.262 --> 36:10.265
Why aren't you calling me
back or answering my texts?

36:10.299 --> 36:13.201
I'm starting to think
something bad happened to you.

36:13.236 --> 36:17.439
I don't care if you're
at Ana's. Just call me.

36:23.646 --> 36:25.580
Well, that was awkward.

36:25.615 --> 36:29.284
- No one asked her to leave.
- We didn't ask her to stay.

36:33.122 --> 36:35.290
Ten years together. How is it I
didn't know you want to be married.

36:35.324 --> 36:36.293
Look, it's like you said.

36:36.294 --> 36:38.568
For all intents and
purposes, we are married.

36:38.594 --> 36:42.230
But you want a wedding
and the whole thing...

36:42.265 --> 36:45.400
Lena, it's embarrassing
that I didn't know that.

36:47.203 --> 36:49.004
I assumed you did.

36:49.038 --> 36:51.339
So, all these years, you've been
expecting me to propose to you?

36:51.374 --> 36:53.341
Were you expecting some
flash mob or something?

36:53.376 --> 36:56.244
- Don't be an ass.
- Don't tell me how to react.

36:58.080 --> 37:01.082
- Can I talk to you?
- Can it wait, Mariana?

37:01.117 --> 37:03.151
No.

37:05.121 --> 37:09.257
Um... so, I got in
contact with our birth mom.

37:09.292 --> 37:11.259
With Ana.

37:11.294 --> 37:14.162
Yes?

37:14.197 --> 37:16.131
And, um...

37:16.165 --> 37:18.133
she's living in town,

37:18.167 --> 37:22.971
in a crackhouse or something.

37:23.005 --> 37:25.974
And...

37:26.008 --> 37:30.011
I'm pretty sure Jesus
is there with her now.

37:31.180 --> 37:33.114
I'm so sorry.

37:44.055 --> 37:46.123
- What are you doing?
- Going to get our son.

37:46.158 --> 37:47.992
Can you get the address
from Mariana, please?

37:48.026 --> 37:50.828
Stef, wait. Don't you think
we should call the police?

37:50.862 --> 37:52.062
What do you think I am?

37:52.097 --> 37:55.132
Anyway, technically, she
hasn't committed a crime, so...

37:55.167 --> 37:59.003
I'm just going to go get Jesus
and leave. So don't worry.

37:59.037 --> 38:01.906
Mariana, I need the address
of that house, please.

38:14.886 --> 38:16.821
You came.

38:17.956 --> 38:19.924
Yeah, but on one condition.

38:19.958 --> 38:23.727
- This is a date, ok?
- Ok.

38:23.762 --> 38:27.064
Or else I'm going back to my
non-existent "thing" like, right now.

38:27.098 --> 38:29.099
I said, ok.

38:30.769 --> 38:33.003
- Next time, I pick the movie.
- Deal.

38:34.739 --> 38:36.106
What do you think they're saying?

38:36.141 --> 38:38.075
Why is he giving her so much shampoo?

38:38.109 --> 38:40.678
Oh, my dear.

38:40.712 --> 38:43.881
You have to get out of
bed, your hair is a mess.

38:43.915 --> 38:49.753
No, no, no. You must take
this back and take this back...

38:49.788 --> 38:53.023
What's at the bottom of
your bag? Is it a badger?

38:53.058 --> 38:55.860
Badger?

38:55.894 --> 38:57.761
Yes, that's my pet badger.

38:57.796 --> 39:02.933
I think it's very rude for you to
talk about him like he's not here.

39:04.803 --> 39:06.737
Here, let me put him away...

39:06.771 --> 39:08.739
before he gets his feelings hurt.

39:27.626 --> 39:29.827
You taste like badger, George.

39:29.861 --> 39:31.862
Something you want to tell me?

39:46.945 --> 39:50.447
Their harmonies are amazing.

39:50.482 --> 39:51.715
I wonder what it's like,

39:51.750 --> 39:53.450
being married and working together.

39:53.485 --> 39:56.453
Romantic or exhausting.

39:56.488 --> 39:58.455
Probably both.

39:58.490 --> 40:01.625
Anyway... thanks.

40:02.894 --> 40:04.862
So, how's your music?

40:04.896 --> 40:09.867
Um... I finally started taking
lessons from Henry Marshall.

40:09.901 --> 40:12.836
What? Oh, my God. That's amazing.

40:12.871 --> 40:14.838
I mean, it's not that big of a deal.

40:14.873 --> 40:16.198
Yes, it is.

40:16.199 --> 40:18.843
You were totally crushed when
he didn't pick you last year.

40:20.579 --> 40:22.846
- Yeah...
- How is it?

40:22.881 --> 40:24.782
The lessons, I mean.

40:24.816 --> 40:27.618
Uh, fine. I guess.

40:27.652 --> 40:31.589
I mean, he's not exactly the
warmest dude I've ever met.

40:31.623 --> 40:33.524
They never are.

40:33.558 --> 40:36.860
Yeah. I don't know if I'm
going to stay with him.

40:36.895 --> 40:39.663
Brandon, you have to.

40:39.698 --> 40:41.699
It's what you dreamed of.

40:41.733 --> 40:44.602
Yeah, the lessons are really expensive.

40:44.636 --> 40:47.438
It puts a lot of pressure on my dad.

40:47.472 --> 40:49.573
You'll be fine.

40:50.775 --> 40:53.510
I don't think Marshall thinks it will.

40:53.545 --> 40:55.846
He says I need to "face my pain."

40:55.880 --> 40:58.582
Right?

40:58.617 --> 41:02.519
I don't even think I've ever had
the kind of pain he's talking about.

41:04.856 --> 41:06.890
Do you want to grab a coffee?

41:06.925 --> 41:10.661
- I'd like that.
- Ok.

41:29.581 --> 41:33.817
Lena called. Thought you
might need some backup.

41:48.867 --> 41:51.502
Anybody home? Police.

41:54.706 --> 41:56.674
Jesus?

41:59.911 --> 42:01.812
Drugs...
