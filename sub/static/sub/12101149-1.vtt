M_I_SForEver

00:55.335 --> 00:57.170
Do you...

00:57.203 --> 01:00.506
Do you not know that your bodies

01:00.540 --> 01:02.442
are temples of the holy spirit?

01:05.646 --> 01:08.247
Who is in you.

01:08.281 --> 01:09.817
Whom you have received from God.

01:12.251 --> 01:16.624
You, you are not
your own.

01:18.626 --> 01:22.696
You were bought, you
were bought at a price.

01:22.730 --> 01:25.866
Therefore, honor God with your
bodies.

01:27.433 --> 01:29.703
There will be terrible
times in the last days.

01:30.671 --> 01:33.874
People will be lovers of
themselves, lovers of money.

01:35.843 --> 01:37.343
Boastful.

01:37.377 --> 01:38.846
Proud.

01:38.879 --> 01:40.413
Abusive.

01:40.446 --> 01:43.784
Treacherous, rash, conceited.

01:43.817 --> 01:45.919
Lovers of- lovers of-

01:45.953 --> 01:49.155
Lovers of pleasure rather
than lovers of God.

01:50.456 --> 01:53.326
Having a form of Godliness
but denying its power

01:54.293 --> 01:57.330
Have nothing- have nothing
to do with such people.

01:57.363 --> 02:01.234
They are the kinds who worm their way

02:01.267 --> 02:04.905
into homes and gain control
over gullible women.

02:10.978 --> 02:12.478
"Therefore, we will
not fear,

02:12.512 --> 02:13.546
though the earth give way

02:13.580 --> 02:16.516
and the mountains fall
into the heart of the sea,

02:16.549 --> 02:18.919
though its waters roar and foam

02:18.952 --> 02:21.287
and the mountains quake
with their surging.

02:21.320 --> 02:22.890
Glad the city of God,

02:22.923 --> 02:25.525
the holy place where
the Most High dwells."

02:36.704 --> 02:39.539
"He breaks the bow and shatters
the spear.

02:39.573 --> 02:42.241
He burns the shields with fire.

02:46.446 --> 02:50.450
For persecution or famine
or nakedness or sword.

02:52.019 --> 02:54.021
As it is written.

02:54.054 --> 02:57.490
For your sake we face death all
day long.

02:57.523 --> 02:59.960
We are considered as
sheep to be slaughtered."

05:02.649 --> 05:04.985
Sordico, the genus
purpiceps.

05:11.191 --> 05:13.627
The dark-purplish buds
on this head of wheat

05:14.728 --> 05:17.396
are the so-called sclerotia of
sordico,

05:18.098 --> 05:19.833
from the genus purpiceps.

05:23.670 --> 05:26.539
This indicates the beginning
of the sexual stage...

05:30.644 --> 05:33.080
Once winter is over,
the sordico will sprout

05:33.113 --> 05:35.182
to mushroom-like structures,

05:35.215 --> 05:37.751
which will create the sexual
spore stage,

05:39.953 --> 05:42.421
which takes place throughout
the spring season.

05:44.523 --> 05:45.993
This stage will be discharged

05:46.026 --> 05:48.494
from the fruit bodies
by the fungus and dicem-

05:48.527 --> 05:52.132
- I've got purpose, Jim,
god damn it.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.534
I've got purpose, Jim, god damn
it.

05:58.471 --> 06:00.741
I've got purpose, god damn it,
Jim.

06:03.110 --> 06:04.011
Give me...

06:05.612 --> 06:06.512
Damn it, Jim!

06:07.881 --> 06:09.716
Give me a fucking chance!

06:10.684 --> 06:14.021
Damn it, Jim, give me a, give me
a fu-

06:14.054 --> 06:15.454
- After the
infection takes hold,

06:15.488 --> 06:18.424
the asexual spore stage is
created.

06:19.559 --> 06:21.828
This is called the purpolia
stage,

06:24.932 --> 06:27.701
which creates its spores in a
honeydew-

06:27.734 --> 06:30.037
- A fucking chance!

06:30.070 --> 06:32.139
Just give me a fucking chance!

06:35.709 --> 06:38.745
Poisoning,
caused by sordico of wheat

06:38.779 --> 06:41.248
is referred to as sordicism.

06:41.281 --> 06:43.917
There are two types of
symptoms that can occur

06:43.951 --> 06:45.518
in cases of serious poisoning.

06:49.756 --> 06:50.523
I've got a purpose.

06:50.557 --> 06:51.625
Gangrenous
sordicism

06:52.426 --> 06:54.194
is common in grazing farm
animals.

06:55.796 --> 06:57.931
It causes gangrene to
occur by constricting

06:57.965 --> 07:00.466
the blood vessels that
lead to the extremities.

07:01.301 --> 07:04.071
Convulsive sordicism is
characterized

07:04.104 --> 07:06.139
by disfunction within the
nervous system,

07:07.240 --> 07:10.911
where the animal twists and
contorts its body in pain.

07:11.845 --> 07:15.949
Trembling and shaking.

07:17.217 --> 07:20.954
Typically, when a bovid
becomes infected by sordico,

07:20.988 --> 07:22.521
it must be put down,

07:23.790 --> 07:25.892
and the entire crops from
that season destroyed.

07:35.335 --> 07:38.271
Symptoms of gangrenous
and convulsive sordicism

07:38.305 --> 07:42.009
can occur in varying degrees
in any animal or human

07:43.143 --> 07:44.778
who has consumed sordico.

07:46.279 --> 07:48.749
In the Middle Ages, unaware of
the risks,

07:49.850 --> 07:52.185
the common folk of Europe
rarely made the effort

07:52.219 --> 07:54.087
to remove the sordico from the
wheat,

07:55.055 --> 07:58.058
so the fungal wheat flour was
often baked into the bread.

07:59.693 --> 08:02.629
There are extensive accounts
of these ignorant peasants

08:02.662 --> 08:05.032
suffering from burning
sensations in their limbs,

08:05.999 --> 08:07.533
amputations due to gangrene,

08:08.969 --> 08:10.971
dizziness, nausea, and,

08:12.005 --> 08:16.977
if consumed over a long period
of time, gradual insanity.

08:20.647 --> 08:23.250
These symptoms were titled Godly
flames,

08:25.385 --> 08:29.256
as many considered them
a punishment from God.

08:30.123 --> 08:33.025
A tribulation for the sins of
the people.

09:03.857 --> 09:06.093
- Oh, shit.
- What?

09:06.126 --> 09:07.727
The fucking GPS lost
service.

09:07.761 --> 09:08.762
Did you mess with it?

09:08.795 --> 09:10.063
What do you
mean, did I mess with it?

09:10.097 --> 09:10.931
What are you doing?

09:10.964 --> 09:12.732
I think one of the tires
is low.

09:12.766 --> 09:14.868
- The tires don't feel low.
- Just shh.

09:14.901 --> 09:16.236
It's not
supposed to lose direction

09:16.269 --> 09:17.704
where there's no signal.

09:17.737 --> 09:18.638
Did you touch it?

09:20.674 --> 09:22.742
It's literally like two
and a half minutes away.

09:22.776 --> 09:24.911
I'll get us there without GPS.

09:24.945 --> 09:26.847
That kid is staring at
us.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.782
- What kid?
- On the bike.

09:28.815 --> 09:30.016
What the fuck?

09:31.118 --> 09:32.853
I'm gonna
ask him for directions.

09:32.886 --> 09:33.920
Sam, no.

09:34.955 --> 09:35.822
Sam.

09:37.891 --> 09:38.758
Hey.

09:39.960 --> 09:43.163
Do you know how to get to
Bardwells Ferry Road from here?

09:45.232 --> 09:46.099
Hello?

09:52.939 --> 09:53.807
Rude.

09:59.246 --> 10:00.747
Big weirdy weirdo.

10:01.982 --> 10:04.751
You definitely
messed with the GPS.

10:04.784 --> 10:05.719
Tire's fine.

10:09.956 --> 10:10.924
What?

10:23.236 --> 10:25.772
- What just-
- No idea.

10:25.805 --> 10:28.241
No idea.

11:19.259 --> 11:20.927
Pardon my French,

11:21.795 --> 11:24.130
but I didn't come all the way
down here

11:24.164 --> 11:26.399
to Albuquerque to get fucked.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.869
To get fucked, bucko.

11:29.903 --> 11:30.804
Hey, Jim.

11:32.172 --> 11:34.040
Remember that night in Vegas,

11:35.175 --> 11:38.979
when we met those two broads at
Caesar's?

11:39.012 --> 11:41.548
Well, there's something I never
told you.

11:41.582 --> 11:43.316
There's somethin'...

13:01.928 --> 13:02.596
Hey, Jim.

13:05.065 --> 13:05.932
Hey, Jim.

13:07.967 --> 13:08.835
Hey, Jim.

13:11.004 --> 13:15.241
I'm sorry and please pardon my
French,

13:15.275 --> 13:19.412
but I just get nervous around
cool guys,

13:19.446 --> 13:23.651
and when I got on that plane, I
just-

13:23.684 --> 13:25.085
- You hate me.

13:25.118 --> 13:26.252
Hm?

13:26.286 --> 13:28.221
I've just been crazy
pre-occupied.

13:28.254 --> 13:29.522
It's fine.

13:29.557 --> 13:31.358
I swear, it's fine.

13:32.359 --> 13:35.028
I swear, I swear, I swear.

13:35.061 --> 13:35.995
You hate me.

13:37.364 --> 13:38.231
Yes.

13:39.532 --> 13:42.168
I 100% don't hate you, it's
totally fine.

13:42.202 --> 13:43.903
We're both distracted right now.

13:49.677 --> 13:51.211
I repulse you.

13:51.244 --> 13:52.680
I totally get it.

14:03.390 --> 14:04.991
Hell of a haunch.

14:05.024 --> 14:06.493
Thanks to you.

14:06.526 --> 14:08.261
Yeah, that's what eating raw

14:08.294 --> 14:10.964
and burning 35,000 calories
a month will get you.

14:10.997 --> 14:12.999
Yeah, that and a stomach full
of acid.

14:14.534 --> 14:15.435
Did you take your-

14:15.468 --> 14:17.070
- Yes!
- All right.

14:24.645 --> 14:26.546
Ow, what the fuck,
Rylie?

14:26.580 --> 14:27.247
Sorry!

14:27.280 --> 14:29.416
- What the fuck?
- I'm sorry!

14:42.630 --> 14:43.963
Hello?

14:43.997 --> 14:44.964
Hello?

14:54.608 --> 14:56.142
- Hello?
- Hello?

14:58.211 --> 15:00.013
Anybody home?

15:00.714 --> 15:02.315
Yeah, what the-

15:02.348 --> 15:03.516
- Shh.

15:03.550 --> 15:05.251
Yeah, who is, who's there?

15:06.319 --> 15:08.622
Sorry if I scared ya.

15:08.656 --> 15:09.690
Can we help you?

15:13.293 --> 15:14.695
You're on my property.

15:32.479 --> 15:33.513
Oh, great.

15:51.699 --> 15:53.634
Sorry if I scared ya!

15:55.368 --> 15:57.070
This is your property?

15:58.839 --> 16:00.774
500 acres.

16:00.808 --> 16:03.476
Between Cedar and Hillside.

16:03.510 --> 16:04.678
Oh, you're kidding.

16:10.183 --> 16:11.050
Nope...

16:14.153 --> 16:15.689
Two of you in there?

16:18.224 --> 16:19.359
Huh?

16:20.561 --> 16:23.797
Are there two of you in
there?

16:23.831 --> 16:24.698
Yeah?

16:28.301 --> 16:30.436
So, do we need to pack up?

16:32.873 --> 16:33.741
Yeah.

16:38.779 --> 16:39.647
All right.

16:42.650 --> 16:44.183
What, what's your name?

16:45.184 --> 16:46.219
Eulis.

16:46.252 --> 16:47.387
What, what was that?

16:49.690 --> 16:50.558
Eulis!

16:52.358 --> 16:53.326
I, I can't-

16:53.359 --> 16:55.161
- E-U-L-I-S.

16:56.730 --> 16:58.699
Oh, Eulis.

16:58.732 --> 17:01.334
Do you know anything that
might be open this late?

17:01.367 --> 17:02.836
Like a motel or...

17:05.772 --> 17:08.308
Not right in town that I can
think of.

17:10.242 --> 17:12.579
There might be something further
north.

17:23.388 --> 17:26.192
Might be something further
north.

17:28.328 --> 17:29.429
Okay.

17:29.462 --> 17:30.296
Thanks.

17:33.634 --> 17:36.670
I'll come back around,
next couple hours.

17:36.704 --> 17:39.172
Make sure you're outta here.

17:39.205 --> 17:41.140
Yeah, we'll be out in a bit.

17:41.174 --> 17:43.309
Make sure to douse that fire.

17:43.343 --> 17:44.510
Yeah, will do!

17:47.615 --> 17:48.782
Get home safe.

17:50.718 --> 17:51.652
Yeah, thank you.

18:14.207 --> 18:15.643
We're probably gonna have
to drive out a couple miles

18:15.676 --> 18:16.877
before we get any service,

18:16.910 --> 18:19.412
but I think I can get
us into town on my own.

18:31.257 --> 18:31.925
Nope.

18:34.795 --> 18:36.396
Fucking nope.

18:36.429 --> 18:38.197
Sam.

18:38.231 --> 18:39.198
Fucking nope!

18:39.232 --> 18:39.967
Sam!

18:40.000 --> 18:40.668
Did you leave the hazards on?

18:40.701 --> 18:42.268
Did I leave the hazards on?

18:44.237 --> 18:47.373
Once we get to the main road
that should bring us into town.

18:47.407 --> 18:49.509
Worst case, we call AAA from
there.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.411
Be home by five AM.

18:51.444 --> 18:52.813
As long as that's the
worst case.

18:52.846 --> 18:54.347
Oh, that's the spirit.

18:55.816 --> 18:58.351
I have 47% battery, how much do
you have?

18:58.384 --> 18:59.053
30.

18:59.953 --> 19:01.421
- Is it on low power?
- Yes.

19:01.454 --> 19:03.356
- All other apps-
- All apps are off.

19:03.389 --> 19:04.725
Brightness all the way
down?

19:04.758 --> 19:06.426
Whoa, what the...

19:13.000 --> 19:14.434
Jesus Christ.

19:14.467 --> 19:15.736
What the fuck?

19:26.512 --> 19:30.316
We couldn't just do a nice day
hike, nope.

19:30.349 --> 19:31.952
Will you just give it a rest,
Sam?

19:31.985 --> 19:34.822
Just, will you shut up?

19:35.823 --> 19:37.558
- Excuse me?
- Just shut up.

20:03.382 --> 20:04.250
Wait.

20:04.985 --> 20:05.853
Sam?

20:08.722 --> 20:10.490
It's okay, I forgive you!

20:10.523 --> 20:11.390
Idiot.

20:13.459 --> 20:14.595
Nice.

20:14.628 --> 20:15.696
- Look.
- What?

20:17.865 --> 20:18.732
There.

20:21.702 --> 20:22.603
What, the light?

20:22.636 --> 20:24.838
No, the darkness surrounding
the light.

20:26.874 --> 20:27.875
God, come on.

20:54.001 --> 20:55.869
Coochie coochie coo!

21:02.743 --> 21:03.844
Oh, my god, Sam.

21:05.612 --> 21:07.380
God, you're really something
tonight.

21:07.413 --> 21:08.749
I'm something tonight?

21:19.525 --> 21:21.360
- Not to mention the five-
- Shh!

21:21.394 --> 21:24.097
- If you shush me one more-
- Just shh!

21:33.740 --> 21:35.374
What's that smell?

21:36.944 --> 21:39.713
- Hi!
- Oh, hi there.

21:39.746 --> 21:40.848
Hi.

21:40.881 --> 21:42.082
We're so sorry to bother you.

21:42.115 --> 21:46.385
We were just wondering if we
could maybe borrow your phone?

21:46.419 --> 21:49.455
See, we were camping a little
ways in, near the wheat fields

21:49.488 --> 21:52.425
and the land owner told
us that we had to leave.

21:52.458 --> 21:54.027
Oh, my goodness.

21:54.061 --> 21:57.530
Yeah, so we were all set to
drive home,

21:57.564 --> 22:00.033
and then our car wouldn't
start and we weren't able

22:00.067 --> 22:01.835
to track down any cell service.

22:12.478 --> 22:15.949
So, we were wondering if
maybe we could use your phone

22:15.983 --> 22:17.885
to call AAA for a jump?

22:21.520 --> 22:23.090
Hi, I'm Sam.

22:23.123 --> 22:24.157
Hi, Sam.

22:29.897 --> 22:31.198
Should...

22:31.231 --> 22:33.667
Oh, please, please!

22:33.700 --> 22:35.702
Where are my manners?

22:35.736 --> 22:37.738
Ah, thank you so much.

22:37.771 --> 22:39.072
Thank you so much.

22:40.473 --> 22:41.141
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi.

22:42.541 --> 22:44.111
- I'm Karen.
- Hi, Karen.

22:46.847 --> 22:50.449
AAA won't do you any good over
here.

22:51.484 --> 22:55.856
Take 'em two-three hours just to
get here.

22:55.889 --> 22:57.891
Not worth it just for a jump.

22:59.192 --> 23:04.231
Now, my neighbor, Pete, he
could be here in 30 minutes.

23:04.264 --> 23:06.633
Settle for a T-bone steak

23:06.667 --> 23:09.970
and a glass of milk for
compensation.

23:10.003 --> 23:12.239
Wouldn't have to spend a nickel.

23:12.272 --> 23:13.206
That'd be great.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.876
Are you sure that he's
awake? It's already-

23:15.909 --> 23:16.977
- Pete?

23:17.010 --> 23:18.211
Karen.

23:19.179 --> 23:21.214
I've got a sweet couple here.

23:21.248 --> 23:23.684
Had their camping trip wrecked

23:23.717 --> 23:26.553
by some scum sucker over by...

23:27.888 --> 23:29.156
Did you get his name?

23:30.223 --> 23:31.191
Eulis.

23:31.224 --> 23:32.759
You-us?

23:32.793 --> 23:33.660
Eulis.

23:34.628 --> 23:36.863
E-U-L-I-S.

23:36.897 --> 23:39.166
Oh, Eulis.

23:39.199 --> 23:41.500
You know a, a Eulis?

23:43.804 --> 23:44.671
Eulis.

23:45.939 --> 23:46.773
Eulis!

23:50.844 --> 23:52.946
Oh, okay.

23:52.980 --> 23:53.847
Okay.

23:55.649 --> 23:56.515
Okay.

23:57.617 --> 23:59.619
So I'll see you in a bit.

23:59.653 --> 24:02.089
See ya in a bit!

24:03.690 --> 24:05.559
And if you've got your teeth in,

24:05.592 --> 24:09.196
I'll fix ya a cut and a fresh
loaf.

24:10.831 --> 24:12.699
All right, my dear.

24:22.042 --> 24:24.543
Did he say how long he might
be?

24:24.578 --> 24:25.812
Eulis?

24:25.846 --> 24:26.847
Pete.

24:26.880 --> 24:27.981
Oh!

24:28.015 --> 24:29.649
Pete.

24:29.683 --> 24:33.854
- We don't wanna overstay.
- Oh, please, please, please.

24:33.887 --> 24:37.157
He shouldn't be more than 30
minutes.

24:39.092 --> 24:41.762
Worst case, 45, since he's
gettin' on.

24:41.795 --> 24:43.997
No, that's great, that's
perfect.

24:46.233 --> 24:49.136
Perfect.

25:07.154 --> 25:08.355
Again, thank you so...

25:09.823 --> 25:11.825
Oh, my goodness!

25:13.126 --> 25:15.028
Where are my manners?

25:15.062 --> 25:16.930
You two must be stravin'!

25:16.963 --> 25:17.631
Actually, a little.

25:17.664 --> 25:19.166
Actually, I think we're fine.

25:19.199 --> 25:21.168
Oh, you're a couple of sticks.

25:21.201 --> 25:23.937
Come on, come on!

25:23.970 --> 25:25.672
Come on, Rylie.

25:25.705 --> 25:26.573
You're a stick.

25:42.289 --> 25:43.957
Oh dear, oh dear.

25:45.092 --> 25:47.761
I always overshoot at low heat.

25:51.264 --> 25:54.267
Is there any spinach in the
house?

26:37.944 --> 26:42.916
It gets so hot when I cook,
so I leave it open.

26:42.949 --> 26:44.117
Have a seat!

26:50.190 --> 26:51.057
Hello.

26:57.164 --> 26:58.031
Hi.

27:10.210 --> 27:11.912
Please!

27:11.945 --> 27:15.315
Sit down.

27:15.348 --> 27:19.152
Have somethin' for ya in 10-15
minutes.

27:25.959 --> 27:27.093
You like steak?

27:27.127 --> 27:30.730
Oh, Sam is actually off
red meat as of recently, so-

27:30.764 --> 27:32.832
- Well, I, I-
- How do you like 'em?

27:32.866 --> 27:35.735
No, I'm sorry, he's
actually off red meat.

27:37.971 --> 27:39.806
I had a physical a few months
ago

27:39.839 --> 27:41.808
and my cholesterol is not great.

27:41.841 --> 27:43.276
It's 270, actually.

27:43.310 --> 27:45.812
- Doctor suggested that I-
- He can't have any red meat.

27:45.845 --> 27:48.481
Any dairy, sugar, salt.

27:48.515 --> 27:50.417
Maybe a little piece of
chicken once a month, but that-

27:50.450 --> 27:51.985
- A quarter chicken once a
month.

27:52.018 --> 27:53.220
- He suggested-
- You can't have it.

27:53.253 --> 27:54.454
Bless you.

27:57.424 --> 28:01.194
And I'm actually a
vegan, believe it or not.

28:12.405 --> 28:13.240
Oh, boy.

28:14.975 --> 28:17.277
I take a three and a half,
but an eight feels so good.

28:17.310 --> 28:19.079
I've gotta get 12s.

28:22.916 --> 28:24.351
Oh, perfect.

28:29.356 --> 28:30.423
Do you need some help?

28:31.358 --> 28:32.392
- Where's your restroom?
- What?

28:32.425 --> 28:34.562
Take a left out of the
kitchen,

28:34.595 --> 28:36.296
then a right before the stairs.

29:56.976 --> 29:59.346
So, were you at all
affected by the sordico?

30:04.984 --> 30:05.852
Karen?

30:11.625 --> 30:14.094
- Hey, Karen?
- What's that, dear?

30:14.127 --> 30:16.096
Were you
affected by the sordico,

30:16.129 --> 30:17.130
a little while back?

30:18.098 --> 30:19.132
The sordico?

30:19.165 --> 30:22.068
The cattle deaths, from
the Sordico of wheat?

30:22.969 --> 30:24.070
Oh, right, right.

30:25.038 --> 30:27.006
The sordico.

30:27.040 --> 30:29.275
How do you know about all that?

30:29.309 --> 30:31.411
I'm getting my doctorate in
botany.

30:32.445 --> 30:36.049
I'm doing my thesis
project on the resurgence

30:36.082 --> 30:38.118
of sordico in New England crops

30:38.151 --> 30:41.154
and their life cycle in
this particular climate.

30:45.659 --> 30:48.261
Must've really disrupted
the industry over here.

30:48.294 --> 30:50.463
At least the meat trade.

30:50.497 --> 30:52.031
Oh, sure, sure.

30:53.266 --> 30:57.437
We were one of the top meat and
wheat farmers in the county.

30:57.470 --> 30:58.538
Wow, really?

31:00.039 --> 31:02.710
Now we trade with the farmer
nearby.

31:02.743 --> 31:07.013
Our veggies for his meat and
grain.

31:08.148 --> 31:09.717
Have you ever considered
moving?

31:18.692 --> 31:20.427
You like cardamom?

31:22.162 --> 31:23.029
Love it.

31:45.051 --> 31:47.053
Would you
like me if I wore a uniform?

32:32.365 --> 32:33.500
Great bread.

32:48.348 --> 32:49.717
So, is that your daughter

32:49.750 --> 32:51.619
in those pictures in the hall,
Karen?

33:09.570 --> 33:10.403
Sorry.

33:10.436 --> 33:12.171
Did something happen?

33:12.205 --> 33:15.475
I love Christmas music.

33:33.393 --> 33:35.361
So, is Pete pretty close, you
think?

33:37.363 --> 33:39.165
- Sam, would you like some-
- Hey, Karen?

33:40.300 --> 33:42.468
You think that Pete is pretty
close?

33:44.337 --> 33:47.641
That's 15 minutes
fast.

33:48.541 --> 33:51.244
Wouldn't say more than another
30.

33:51.277 --> 33:52.412
He's gettin' on.

33:59.920 --> 34:02.355
He may look like a chunky monkey
now,

34:02.388 --> 34:05.358
but he used to come in at an
even 400.

34:05.391 --> 34:06.894
Who's that, Pete?

34:06.927 --> 34:07.795
Gunni.

34:09.295 --> 34:10.196
My son.

34:11.431 --> 34:13.498
Got kicked.

34:13.533 --> 34:16.536
By a bull, about six months ago.

34:16.570 --> 34:17.737
Right in the face.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.139
Hasn't been the same.

34:21.373 --> 34:22.810
God, I'm sorry.

34:23.844 --> 34:28.514
Oh.

34:30.483 --> 34:32.217
A little butter won't hurt him.

34:34.487 --> 34:35.355
Thank you.

34:36.289 --> 34:39.726
Left, right, left, right,
left, right.

34:39.760 --> 34:41.862
- So, what do you do, Sam?
- Well, I'm, uh-

34:41.895 --> 34:43.362
- He's an actor.

34:43.396 --> 34:44.831
Oh, really?

34:44.864 --> 34:46.833
- Waiter/actor.
- Actor/waiter.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.601
In between waiting jobs.

34:48.636 --> 34:50.737
He's just getting too many
auditions.

34:50.771 --> 34:51.605
Can never remember the
specials.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.940
I've got the same problem with
scripts.

34:56.476 --> 34:59.178
Well, this weekend, he's
my research assistant.

35:05.786 --> 35:07.921
Was that your bear trap out in
the woods?

35:15.863 --> 35:17.463
Hey, Karen?

35:17.497 --> 35:21.367
Just a nib, Goon
buggy.

35:21.401 --> 35:23.737
Oh, come on, buggy boy, just a
peck.

35:28.575 --> 35:29.576
Just a peck.

36:43.717 --> 36:45.451
Room for dessert?

36:45.485 --> 36:48.722
Whole tray of cupcakes in the
fridge.

36:48.756 --> 36:50.557
Baked 'em yesterday!

36:56.029 --> 36:57.865
Oh, I'm stuffed.

36:57.898 --> 36:59.365
Yeah, me too, thank you.

37:39.405 --> 37:40.574
Oh, Sam.

37:40.607 --> 37:41.742
Tea?

37:48.081 --> 37:51.118
Sorry again, about Pete.

37:51.151 --> 37:55.923
He tends to fall asleep,
just outta nowhere.

37:57.024 --> 38:00.127
Even in the middle of
conversations, sometimes.

38:00.160 --> 38:02.095
- Like a narcoleptic?
- Nope.

38:04.598 --> 38:06.767
You know, we really
don't mind just calling for-

38:06.800 --> 38:10.771
- Oh and if you get a
hankerin' for anything,

38:10.804 --> 38:12.505
go back upstairs!

38:12.538 --> 38:15.909
There's plenty of leftov-.

38:17.845 --> 38:19.345
That's our dog, Earl.

38:20.614 --> 38:21.648
We keep him in the barn, a
little ways in.

38:25.853 --> 38:27.120
Bad with people.

38:29.522 --> 38:34.527
There's no, uh, online or
phone service over here,

38:35.629 --> 38:37.463
but if you're desperate,

38:37.496 --> 38:41.134
you might try a little
further in, that a way.

38:42.803 --> 38:44.905
Cellular phone wise.

38:46.807 --> 38:50.476
I think some sorta
tower might reach there.

38:51.645 --> 38:52.946
Oh, I think we'll be all
right.

38:52.980 --> 38:55.916
Gunni usually sleeps down
here.

38:55.949 --> 38:58.118
I'll keep him up with me
tonight.

38:58.151 --> 38:59.452
Are you sure?

39:02.155 --> 39:04.490
You know, maybe we should
just...

39:08.896 --> 39:10.197
Come in, come in!

39:10.230 --> 39:11.131
Right this way.

39:12.498 --> 39:13.166
Sam.

39:17.503 --> 39:18.839
Right this way.

39:26.847 --> 39:28.882
Got your own bathroom back
there.

39:28.916 --> 39:32.152
You even have a TV.

39:32.185 --> 39:34.554
Think we had a couple of...

39:48.568 --> 39:52.873
Oh!

39:58.278 --> 40:01.214
We really appreciate
your hospitality, Karen.

40:35.816 --> 40:39.553
If he doesn't haul over in 15,

40:40.320 --> 40:43.890
I'll snag his cables myself.

40:43.924 --> 40:47.160
- We really appreciate it.

Sam.

44:17.003 --> 44:17.871
Sam?

44:20.207 --> 44:21.074
Samuel.

44:26.913 --> 44:29.182
Why are you getting dressed?

44:31.451 --> 44:32.819
What, are you leaving?

44:36.790 --> 44:38.225
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

45:33.446 --> 45:34.381
Oh, mama.

47:07.575 --> 47:12.379
Window cleaner!

47:28.228 --> 47:29.329
Window cleaner!

47:39.205 --> 47:40.073
Oh, Jesus.

47:47.447 --> 47:48.314
Jesus.

48:00.427 --> 48:03.296
Oh, lord.

48:37.497 --> 48:41.367
Jesus!

48:53.747 --> 48:54.414
Gunni.

48:57.350 --> 49:00.487
You scared me.

49:41.227 --> 49:42.630
You keep a secret?

49:52.272 --> 49:55.241
I haven't had a grain of salt
in more than three months.

49:58.646 --> 49:59.512
I know.

50:04.484 --> 50:06.687
No red meat, no pink meat.

50:10.123 --> 50:11.224
The occasional fish.

50:14.527 --> 50:15.696
No complex sugars.

50:17.565 --> 50:19.132
No complex carbs.

50:20.300 --> 50:21.334
No starches.

50:24.537 --> 50:26.406
No high-fructose corn syrup.

50:40.554 --> 50:42.522
No refined vegetable oil.

50:43.757 --> 50:45.358
Or sodium benzoate.

50:46.560 --> 50:47.595
No butane.

50:47.628 --> 50:49.863
Did you know they put
butane in chicken nuggets?

50:51.497 --> 50:52.866
No chicken nuggets.

51:12.753 --> 51:13.621
Whoa.

51:19.893 --> 51:21.427
You all right?

51:21.461 --> 51:25.231
Dah... mah...

51:25.264 --> 51:26.499
...Chalk.

51:32.906 --> 51:34.173
Das...

51:35.843 --> 51:38.544
Mah... chalk.

51:38.579 --> 51:39.445
Sorry?

51:45.318 --> 51:46.185
My.

51:47.520 --> 51:48.388
Chalk.

51:52.559 --> 51:54.595
I'm sorry, I can't...

51:54.628 --> 51:55.495
That's magic?

51:58.699 --> 51:59.566
That's.

52:01.534 --> 52:02.368
My.

52:04.370 --> 52:05.238
Chalk!

52:43.644 --> 52:44.510
What?

53:55.115 --> 53:55.983
Yeah?

54:01.454 --> 54:02.089
Sam?

54:09.362 --> 54:10.463
Come on, Sam.

54:12.532 --> 54:14.500
I swear to fucking god.

54:22.009 --> 54:24.077
Sam, consider the consequences.

54:31.885 --> 54:32.753
Sam!

54:48.035 --> 54:50.403
Stop this shit or I'm
breaking up with you!

55:01.915 --> 55:04.017
Sam, I can't tell you how
unfunny you are.

55:22.202 --> 55:24.503
Come on, Sam, just tell me if
it's you.

55:39.686 --> 55:41.154
Sam?

56:19.726 --> 56:20.994
We need to talk.

56:25.832 --> 56:27.668
Well, you know it's cooked,
Jimbo.

56:28.936 --> 56:30.503
It's just still in the thing.

56:31.271 --> 56:33.472
So don't throw any stones.

56:33.506 --> 56:35.108
I've got plenty of license here.

56:36.542 --> 56:38.477
Or baked, or whatever.

56:39.545 --> 56:41.648
Whatever you do, take your
fucking time.

56:42.548 --> 56:43.817
- We need to talk.
- What?

56:45.252 --> 56:48.021
God, what would you do if
this place was on fire, huh?

56:49.222 --> 56:50.958
I feel bad enough about this.

56:55.595 --> 56:56.797
I'm serious, what would you do?

56:56.830 --> 56:58.165
I'd probably be quicker about-

56:58.198 --> 57:00.834
- I don't think you would.

57:00.867 --> 57:02.703
I really don't think you would.

57:02.736 --> 57:04.071
They found a lump.

57:05.105 --> 57:07.140
A what? A what?

57:07.174 --> 57:08.709
A lump.

57:10.010 --> 57:11.510
Oh, cripes.

57:12.879 --> 57:14.681
Oh, cripes.

57:17.584 --> 57:18.618
Where?

57:18.652 --> 57:19.786
In your tum tum.

57:31.732 --> 57:32.766
Window washer.

57:32.799 --> 57:33.967
Of course.

57:34.001 --> 57:35.035
Of course.

57:35.936 --> 57:38.171
This is so predictable.

57:38.205 --> 57:40.040
I have zero appetite.

57:40.073 --> 57:41.875
Is this place open?

57:46.313 --> 57:47.581
What's gonna happen to him?

57:47.614 --> 57:48.281
Shh!

57:51.318 --> 57:52.886
It's just there are moments

57:52.919 --> 57:55.255
hanging in the ether that could
be mine.

57:55.288 --> 57:57.124
Oh, for Christ sake.

58:05.599 --> 58:06.600
Oh, shoot.

58:06.633 --> 58:08.735
It really
isn't as bad as it looks,

58:08.769 --> 58:09.870
and to be honest,

58:09.903 --> 58:13.807
I think you're being a little
bit of a Letdown Larry.

58:15.108 --> 58:17.244
Oh, I can't talk to you right
now.

59:26.379 --> 59:28.148
"For Chrissake.

59:28.181 --> 59:29.649
For Christ's sake.

59:35.155 --> 59:36.723
I've got purpose."

59:40.794 --> 59:41.862
What a piece of shit.

59:50.904 --> 59:51.771
I love you!

59:58.111 --> 59:58.979
Rylie?

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:08.889
Rylie?

01:00:16.429 --> 01:00:17.297
Rylie?

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:26.072
Rylie?

01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:31.678
Rylie?

01:00:36.183 --> 01:00:37.050
Rylie?

01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:43.456
Karen?

01:01:00.941 --> 01:01:01.808
Karen?

01:01:52.459 --> 01:01:53.326
Karen?

01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:58.158
Gunni?

01:02:59.893 --> 01:03:00.561
Gunni!

01:03:04.097 --> 01:03:06.032
Hey, Gunni, open the door!

01:03:09.269 --> 01:03:10.337
Hey!

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:11.237
Gunni!

01:03:13.073 --> 01:03:13.940
Hey!

01:03:14.675 --> 01:03:16.343
What're you doin' out here, man?

01:03:18.144 --> 01:03:19.245
Hey, open the door!

01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:23.316
Hey, Gunni!

01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:28.355
Where's your mom, bud?

01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:29.389
Hey, Gunni, come on!

01:03:31.358 --> 01:03:32.892
Let's go, we'll go inside!

01:03:37.197 --> 01:03:39.132
God damn it, Gunni!

01:03:46.106 --> 01:03:46.973
Hello?

01:03:49.342 --> 01:03:50.210
Rylie?

01:03:54.381 --> 01:03:55.248
Rylie!

01:03:57.951 --> 01:03:58.619
Rylie!

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.187
Rylie!

01:04:04.023 --> 01:04:04.891
Hello?

01:04:52.439 --> 01:04:53.574
Come on, come on, come on.

01:04:53.607 --> 01:04:56.042
911, what's your
emergency?

01:04:56.075 --> 01:04:59.613
Hi, yes I'm calling
about a girl who's gone missing.

01:05:01.214 --> 01:05:02.683
My girlfriend just disappeared.

01:05:02.716 --> 01:05:05.051
- We're staying with this woman-
- What's the address, sir?

01:05:05.084 --> 01:05:07.454
Yeah, I think it's,
uh, it's Cormorant Way

01:05:07.487 --> 01:05:09.322
between, um, I think

01:05:09.355 --> 01:05:12.593
between Pleasant Street and
Trouble Street, I believe.

01:05:12.626 --> 01:05:14.994
I'm going to
need an exact address, sir.

01:05:15.028 --> 01:05:18.264
Okay, yeah, I don't
know, it's a white house.

01:05:18.298 --> 01:05:20.266
Sir, I'm gonna
nee...

01:05:22.035 --> 01:05:22.703
Hello?

01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:25.338
Fuck!

01:08:36.997 --> 01:08:39.966
Do you not know that
your bodies

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.670
are temples of the holy spirit?

01:08:43.804 --> 01:08:44.938
Who is in you.

01:08:46.974 --> 01:08:50.443
Whom you have received from God.

01:08:50.475 --> 01:08:51.344
You.

01:08:53.312 --> 01:08:54.915
You are not your own.

01:08:57.450 --> 01:08:58.451
You were bought.

01:08:59.419 --> 01:09:02.656
You were bought at a price.

01:09:02.689 --> 01:09:05.826
Therefore, honor God with your
bodies.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:10.631
There will be terrible
times in the last days.

01:09:10.663 --> 01:09:13.232
People will be lovers of
themselves.

01:09:14.768 --> 01:09:16.234
Lovers of money.

01:09:17.638 --> 01:09:18.504
Boastful.

01:09:19.471 --> 01:09:20.339
Proud.

01:09:21.809 --> 01:09:22.676
Abusive.

01:09:25.612 --> 01:09:27.948
Treacherous, rash, conceited.

01:09:29.015 --> 01:09:34.220
Lovers of, lovers of the planet
rather than lovers of God.

01:09:36.823 --> 01:09:40.359
Having a form of Godliness
but denying its power

01:09:40.393 --> 01:09:44.598
Having nothing, have nothing
to do with such people.

01:09:44.631 --> 01:09:49.435
There are kinds who worm their way

01:09:49.469 --> 01:09:54.273
into homes and gain control
over gullible women.

01:10:32.946 --> 01:10:34.280
Rylie.

01:10:40.921 --> 01:10:42.823
What's going on?

01:10:42.856 --> 01:10:44.691
Are you okay?

01:12:28.128 --> 01:12:29.528
Don't get up.

01:12:32.498 --> 01:12:33.166
Karen.

01:12:35.068 --> 01:12:35.936
Karen.

01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:39.172
What's, what's going on?

01:13:04.497 --> 01:13:09.502
Goodness gracious

01:13:21.648 --> 01:13:22.515
Karen!

01:14:06.293 --> 01:14:07.160
Rylie.

01:14:10.297 --> 01:14:11.164
Sam.

01:14:14.801 --> 01:14:18.271
We are livin' in a...

01:14:19.272 --> 01:14:22.175
Livin' in a time of tribulation.

01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:25.946
Eul', darnit with that!

01:14:28.582 --> 01:14:30.150
To put it simply.

01:14:31.318 --> 01:14:36.223
We have perverted God's divine
love,

01:14:36.256 --> 01:14:38.725
through abuse of his gifts.

01:14:40.827 --> 01:14:43.830
We were overindulgent in God's
feed,

01:14:45.866 --> 01:14:48.335
and so he took it away.

01:14:48.368 --> 01:14:52.039
Forcing us to seek a
more immediate source,

01:14:53.106 --> 01:14:56.643
so that he may not forsake
us in the end times,

01:14:57.744 --> 01:15:02.149
which, my babies, are
nearer than you may think.

01:15:05.719 --> 01:15:09.656
But we have been given an
opportunity for absolution.

01:15:11.825 --> 01:15:16.196
A second chance to sustain life
entirely

01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:19.633
through consumption of what we
can access

01:15:19.666 --> 01:15:23.904
of our own flesh and available
earth,

01:15:23.937 --> 01:15:26.740
so we may be judged in his
image.

01:15:28.308 --> 01:15:30.977
Now, that's what I call mercy.

01:15:32.312 --> 01:15:33.246
So...

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:38.185
Came up with a sorta
redemption-type program.

01:15:39.653 --> 01:15:41.254
A rationing effort.

01:15:42.222 --> 01:15:47.227
We've had a number of
participants

01:15:47.894 --> 01:15:49.329
over the years.

01:15:50.931 --> 01:15:53.633
I think we've worked out all the
kinks.

01:15:55.302 --> 01:15:56.236
Just about.

01:15:57.370 --> 01:16:02.342
This little sweetheart's
been with us for a while now.

01:16:11.184 --> 01:16:14.688
If there was ever someone
who needed a good sortin'...

01:16:18.024 --> 01:16:21.161
Quite the pig.

01:16:21.194 --> 01:16:23.430
But from his gluttony,

01:16:23.463 --> 01:16:26.133
we were blessed with two cheeks

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.402
and a beefy round.

01:16:30.605 --> 01:16:34.808
He's also taught us a heck
of a lot about perseverance.

01:16:36.376 --> 01:16:41.381
And loyalty.

01:16:44.484 --> 01:16:48.054
And now that we're done with his
bottom,

01:16:49.289 --> 01:16:51.358
we gotta take from the top.

01:18:00.327 --> 01:18:02.362
You've probably been wonderin'

01:18:02.395 --> 01:18:07.334
what the heck is in
this thing.

01:18:27.854 --> 01:18:29.856
This is our daughter.

01:18:29.889 --> 01:18:32.058
My god.

01:18:32.092 --> 01:18:33.026
Delilah.

01:18:44.137 --> 01:18:46.172
She's given us just about
everything

01:18:46.206 --> 01:18:48.541
she's got over the years.

01:18:48.576 --> 01:18:51.244
A true model of self-sacrifice.

01:18:54.314 --> 01:18:55.782
Come on, girlie.

01:19:06.126 --> 01:19:11.131
Oh.

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:23.009
All right, all right.

01:19:23.043 --> 01:19:25.245
I'm honin' in on breakfast.

01:19:27.615 --> 01:19:29.082
Oh, okay, honey.

01:19:30.584 --> 01:19:34.854
It's on its way, my love.

01:19:45.031 --> 01:19:47.167
Ah, that's her language.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.301
That blinkin'?

01:19:48.335 --> 01:19:50.638
She's sayin' "feed me, darn it!

01:19:50.671 --> 01:19:54.874
Feed me that's boy's sweet rear
end."

01:20:03.383 --> 01:20:07.420
Let's get this old girl fed.

01:20:07.454 --> 01:20:08.321
Shall we?

01:20:13.126 --> 01:20:15.895
See how you compare to Buggy
Boy.

01:20:16.996 --> 01:20:18.431
Bless us, O Lord, and these, thy
gifts,

01:20:18.465 --> 01:20:20.133
which we are about to
receive from thy bounty.

01:20:20.166 --> 01:20:24.137
Through Christ, our Lord, amen.

01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:31.378
There you go.

01:20:33.279 --> 01:20:37.317
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:39.018
Slow down, darlin'.

01:20:41.121 --> 01:20:45.959
She's like, "where the hell's
this been all my life?"

01:20:45.992 --> 01:20:49.195
Oh, mama mia!

01:20:57.437 --> 01:21:00.373
Yum, yum, yum, gimme, gimme,
gimme.

01:21:02.308 --> 01:21:03.543
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:21:03.577 --> 01:21:05.478
Pace yourself, darlin'.

01:21:12.653 --> 01:21:14.988
Grade-A prime cut, Samuel.

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:35.643
All right.

01:21:35.676 --> 01:21:37.343
That'll do for now.

01:22:24.357 --> 01:22:28.428
Made from all the brightest
suns of the Universe.

01:22:29.362 --> 01:22:31.030
And volumes beyond.

01:23:00.393 --> 01:23:03.396
You better believe we're
still aimin' for grand babies.

01:23:06.366 --> 01:23:08.802
Bring some sunshine into this
black world.

01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:13.674
Goon here seems to be working
with an empty cartridge.

01:23:19.312 --> 01:23:23.283
There's another little piece
here, babies.

01:23:25.485 --> 01:23:26.352
Goon bug?

01:23:28.254 --> 01:23:29.122
Gunni?

01:23:30.658 --> 01:23:31.524
Gunni!

01:23:33.894 --> 01:23:36.529
One more little piece.

01:23:37.765 --> 01:23:42.603
Eulis here was the go-to farm
vet, once upon a sometime.

01:23:43.536 --> 01:23:46.472
He performs all our procedures.

01:23:48.341 --> 01:23:49.777
We have a little,

01:23:51.277 --> 01:23:52.145
little sorta security system.

01:24:05.258 --> 01:24:06.125
Eulis?

01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:10.496
Eulis.

01:24:15.168 --> 01:24:15.836
Eulis?

01:24:18.672 --> 01:24:19.539
Eulis.

01:24:22.208 --> 01:24:23.409
I've got money.

01:24:27.347 --> 01:24:28.548
I've got money.

01:24:31.484 --> 01:24:33.486
Money, I have got money.

01:24:40.928 --> 01:24:42.195
Money, money, money.

01:24:55.441 --> 01:24:57.343
Eulis, please.

01:24:57.377 --> 01:25:00.781
Please, please.

01:25:00.814 --> 01:25:03.483
- Eulis, come on.
- Shh, shh, shh.

01:25:04.918 --> 01:25:05.819
Turn it up, Goon.

01:25:09.757 --> 01:25:10.691
Goon bug?

01:25:14.293 --> 01:25:16.864
Eulis.

01:25:16.897 --> 01:25:17.765
Eulis.

01:25:19.232 --> 01:25:20.901
Please, Eulis, please.

01:25:22.670 --> 01:25:24.672
This is an
orbitoclast.

01:25:29.475 --> 01:25:32.579
Wasn't an entirely unpopular way
of

01:25:33.981 --> 01:25:37.517
giving people an overhaul, at
one time.

01:25:39.019 --> 01:25:40.888
Please, Eulis, don't do this.

01:25:40.921 --> 01:25:42.455
I'll do anything.

01:25:43.356 --> 01:25:44.992
Eulis, I'll do anything.

01:25:45.025 --> 01:25:47.828
Can't guarantee you
won't try to run off.

01:25:47.861 --> 01:25:49.195
Oh, look at Gunni there.

01:25:50.698 --> 01:25:53.767
Sweet as a baby chipmunk, and
happy, too.

01:25:54.835 --> 01:25:55.703
Truly.

01:25:56.536 --> 01:25:58.839
You're not gonna feel a damn
thing.

01:25:58.872 --> 01:26:00.641
Well, a little pressure, maybe.

01:26:00.674 --> 01:26:03.543
Then it's bright eyes and sweet
smile.

01:26:04.611 --> 01:26:06.647
Not gonna make this
any easier,

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.548
whippin' around, Pork Chop.

01:26:08.582 --> 01:26:10.918
No more strainin', Sam.

01:26:10.951 --> 01:26:14.287
Not one more wracked nerve,
darlin'.

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:20.426
Eulis!

01:26:21.862 --> 01:26:22.863
Come on!

01:26:23.897 --> 01:26:27.668
Bright eyes and sweet smiles.

01:26:28.969 --> 01:26:32.873
No, no!

01:26:32.906 --> 01:26:36.309
Bright eyes and sweet
smiles.

01:26:44.885 --> 01:26:45.753
Shit.

01:26:49.388 --> 01:26:50.958
- Help!
- Help!

01:26:50.991 --> 01:26:52.559
Help!

01:26:52.593 --> 01:26:53.594
- Help!
- Help!

01:26:54.695 --> 01:26:55.896
- Help!
- Help!

01:26:55.929 --> 01:26:57.064
You shut it.

01:26:57.097 --> 01:26:58.464
You shut it!

01:26:58.498 --> 01:26:59.733
- Help!
- Help!

01:26:59.767 --> 01:27:01.668
You shut it, or she
gets it!

01:27:02.535 --> 01:27:03.904
Hey, fellas.

01:27:03.937 --> 01:27:06.372
You shut it, or she gets it.

01:27:10.343 --> 01:27:11.678
So help me, God.

01:27:24.490 --> 01:27:25.759
One more squeak,

01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:30.329
and she'll pop him, right
between the peepers.

01:27:47.714 --> 01:27:51.417
Yeah, no, it's
been a pretty good year.

01:27:51.450 --> 01:27:53.954
Well, it's good to see ya.
It's always good to see ya.

01:27:53.987 --> 01:27:55.354
Yeah, yeah.

01:27:55.388 --> 01:27:58.025
...come and check it
out.

01:28:01.795 --> 01:28:02.863
Hey, Gunni.

01:28:08.902 --> 01:28:09.770
Gunni.

01:28:11.705 --> 01:28:12.906
Gunni, come on.

01:28:13.874 --> 01:28:16.342
Gunni, take off my mask.

01:28:19.746 --> 01:28:22.149
Gunni, go up the stairs.

01:28:22.182 --> 01:28:23.717
Take off my mask.

01:28:32.893 --> 01:28:37.396
Take off my mask, yeah, yeah.

01:28:43.704 --> 01:28:45.572
Gunni, take off her mask.

01:28:45.606 --> 01:28:46.707
Yeah.

01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:48.909
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:28:50.777 --> 01:28:52.846
Yeah, that's good, Gunni.

01:28:54.214 --> 01:28:56.449
Gunni, listen to me.

01:28:57.651 --> 01:28:59.620
Take the tape off our wrists.

01:29:01.554 --> 01:29:02.756
Un-tape our hands.

01:29:06.226 --> 01:29:07.094
Yeah.

01:29:10.998 --> 01:29:12.933
Oh, my god, good.

01:29:12.966 --> 01:29:13.967
Good, Gunni.

01:29:15.002 --> 01:29:16.069
That's great.

01:29:18.872 --> 01:29:19.740
Yeah.

01:29:21.241 --> 01:29:22.643
Now, Gunni, listen to me.

01:29:23.677 --> 01:29:25.178
Listen to me, Gunni.

01:29:25.212 --> 01:29:26.479
Cut the tape.

01:29:35.822 --> 01:29:37.523
Gunni, Gunni.

01:29:37.557 --> 01:29:38.491
Look at me.

01:29:40.027 --> 01:29:43.030
Pull out the knife and cut the
tape.

01:29:44.831 --> 01:29:45.699
Yeah.

01:29:46.767 --> 01:29:47.634
Yeah.

01:29:48.602 --> 01:29:49.535
Right here.

01:29:50.737 --> 01:29:51.738
Good.

01:29:53.941 --> 01:29:54.808
Yeah.

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:00.747
Quicker.

01:30:02.015 --> 01:30:04.084
That's it, that's it.

01:30:04.117 --> 01:30:04.985
Yeah.

01:30:13.026 --> 01:30:15.095
That's good, that's good.

01:30:16.263 --> 01:30:17.631
Yeah, yeah.

01:30:18.531 --> 01:30:20.267
That's great, Gunni.

01:30:25.205 --> 01:30:26.907
That's a good boy.

01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:28.875
Help her.

01:30:28.909 --> 01:30:32.012
Help Rylie.

01:30:45.158 --> 01:30:47.260
Get home safe.

01:30:49.763 --> 01:30:51.665
- Take care.
- Uh-huh.

01:30:58.939 --> 01:30:59.806
Gunni!

01:31:02.009 --> 01:31:03.610
Go, Gunni!

01:31:05.045 --> 01:31:05.912
Gunni!

01:31:07.347 --> 01:31:08.547
Gunni, go!

01:31:09.316 --> 01:31:10.183
Gunni.

01:31:11.118 --> 01:31:12.719
Drop her, darlin'.

01:31:19.259 --> 01:31:20.127
Gunni!

01:31:21.228 --> 01:31:22.629
Go!

01:31:22.662 --> 01:31:23.529
Now!

01:31:24.664 --> 01:31:25.565
Gunni!

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:34.875
Go get the truck!

01:31:34.908 --> 01:31:36.043
Get the truck!

01:33:05.398 --> 01:33:06.700
Gunni!

01:33:12.439 --> 01:33:13.840
Gunni!

01:33:26.987 --> 01:33:27.854
Gunni.

01:36:19.959 --> 01:36:22.630
Calling cars
four, three, two, one.

01:36:22.663 --> 01:36:26.299
Calling cars four, three, two,
one.

01:36:26.333 --> 01:36:27.500
Oh.

01:37:08.341 --> 01:37:12.011
I wanna see the bottom of that
plate when I come back up.

01:37:14.514 --> 01:37:19.352
Mm, yes.

01:38:03.496 --> 01:38:05.566
Oh, my goodness gracious.

01:38:32.158 --> 01:38:34.227
"I don't know," I said.

01:38:35.128 --> 01:38:39.365
"Stop asking me so many
questions, for cripes sake."

01:38:49.677 --> 01:38:52.145
Oh.

01:38:57.383 --> 01:38:59.519
"Ah, how can you tell a thing
like that

01:38:59.552 --> 01:39:02.656
about a person who's
just standing around?"

01:39:02.690 --> 01:39:03.557
I said.

01:39:07.761 --> 01:39:09.229
Hi, Sam.

01:39:15.068 --> 01:39:16.035
Lunch time.

01:39:19.305 --> 01:39:24.310
Let's start with the
yuckies first, shall we?

01:39:24.778 --> 01:39:26.412
Get those out of the way.

01:39:28.381 --> 01:39:31.117
Open up, darlin'.

01:39:31.150 --> 01:39:32.352
Come on.

01:39:32.385 --> 01:39:34.420
Just like Popeye.

01:39:39.325 --> 01:39:40.828
Oh.

01:39:40.861 --> 01:39:45.098
Come on now, Sammy boy.

01:39:45.131 --> 01:39:46.834
Open up, sweetie.

01:39:46.867 --> 01:39:49.135
Come on, my love.

01:39:49.168 --> 01:39:52.071
Just a bite to start.

01:40:04.484 --> 01:40:05.351
Come on.

01:40:07.253 --> 01:40:12.258
You've gotta eat or
you'll turn into a stick.

01:40:16.630 --> 01:40:17.497
Well.

01:40:19.132 --> 01:40:24.103
We'll just get Li Li started
on the goodies, then.

01:40:27.273 --> 01:40:29.710
Here it comes.

01:40:29.743 --> 01:40:31.210
Here it comes!

01:40:46.894 --> 01:40:49.830
If we start with the goodies
first,

01:40:50.831 --> 01:40:54.334
you promise to eat every
last leaf on that plate.

01:40:59.573 --> 01:41:01.240
Well, let me hear "yes, mom."

01:41:02.610 --> 01:41:03.476
Let me hear.

01:41:05.946 --> 01:41:07.280
"Yes, mom."

01:41:14.955 --> 01:41:17.791
Yaaaaaaa

01:41:19.627 --> 01:41:21.595
Maaaaaa.

01:41:21.629 --> 01:41:23.764
Aww.

01:41:30.536 --> 01:41:33.539
Oh.

01:41:33.574 --> 01:41:37.243
Tough today.

01:41:37.276 --> 01:41:38.679
Like shoe leather.

01:41:40.446 --> 01:41:42.215
Oh, gosh.

01:41:50.289 --> 01:41:51.391
Oh.

01:41:51.424 --> 01:41:55.361
See, now this bit isn't so
tough.

01:42:02.569 --> 01:42:06.239
Now, for the extra yummies.

01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:09.175
There we go.

01:42:33.299 --> 01:42:35.468
"Just stop Sis'," I said.

01:42:35.501 --> 01:42:37.738
Let's take a
little break from the grub.

01:42:37.771 --> 01:42:38.972
"Just stop."

01:42:39.006 --> 01:42:40.908
For just a tick.

01:42:47.014 --> 01:42:48.916
That's it.

01:42:53.687 --> 01:42:57.858
Okay, my beautiful girl.

01:42:57.891 --> 01:43:01.695
Come here, my sweet one.

01:43:01.729 --> 01:43:04.330
Come here, my lovely.

01:43:04.363 --> 01:43:06.299
Yes.

01:43:06.332 --> 01:43:07.868
There we go.

01:43:09.335 --> 01:43:12.271
There we go.

01:43:12.305 --> 01:43:14.875
My beautiful, beautiful girl.

01:43:37.898 --> 01:43:41.668
Just relax, babies.

01:43:41.702 --> 01:43:44.337
Oh, just relax.

01:43:46.974 --> 01:43:50.443
Make room for the Lord.

01:43:50.476 --> 01:43:53.346
Breathe him in.

01:43:53.379 --> 01:43:56.282
Breathe him in.

01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:02.421
Do you not know that your bodies

01:44:02.455 --> 01:44:05.726
are temples of the holy spirit?

01:44:05.759 --> 01:44:07.326
Who is in you.

01:44:08.061 --> 01:44:11.765
Who you have received from God.

01:44:13.466 --> 01:44:15.636
You are not your own.

01:44:15.669 --> 01:44:18.672
You were bought at a price.

01:44:18.705 --> 01:44:20.574
Therefore...

01:44:20.607 --> 01:44:24.510
Honor God with your bodies.
