04:12.041 --> 04:12.943
No.

04:16.046 --> 04:18.113
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:25.355 --> 04:26.521

- Thanks.

04:54.518 --> 04:56.153

Oh, man. All right, all right.

Come on.

07:27.237 --> 07:28.205
Hi.

07:29.439 --> 07:31.175
Got your $10 coffee.

07:31.540 --> 07:33.376
- Hi. Thank you.
- Hi. Yeah, yeah.

07:33.977 --> 07:35.576
Come on, hon. Come on.

07:35.578 --> 07:37.381
- Need help?
- No.

07:39.182 --> 07:42.552
- [Nick] No Eddie, huh?
- [Bridget] No, he had to work. Where's dad?

07:43.420 --> 07:46.286
He's looking for her. He's looking
everywhere, every single place

07:46.288 --> 07:47.957
she's ever been in her life.

07:48.391 --> 07:50.425
- Did you check the hospitals?
- Yeah.

07:50.427 --> 07:53.528
Yeah, we checked the hospitals,
St. Giles, Rotary Club,

07:53.530 --> 07:56.030
we even went by the nursing home
in case she thought

07:56.032 --> 07:57.101
she was still working there.

07:58.268 --> 08:00.938
- Did you call the police?
- Of course we called the police.

08:03.305 --> 08:05.139
- Do they have Dad's number?
- Yeah.

08:05.141 --> 08:06.110
Yeah, they've Dad's number,

08:07.110 --> 08:08.375
they've got my number,
your number, your number.

08:08.377 --> 08:11.247
And they've got Marion-Down-The-Hall's
number. The condo.

08:13.249 --> 08:16.220
He's going out of his mind,
Bitty. He's white as a ghost.

08:16.720 --> 08:20.090
When he called me, I thought he
was having another heart attack.

08:20.723 --> 08:22.456
I knew this was gonna happen.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.624
Yeah. I've been tellin' him
for years, "You gotta figure out

08:24.626 --> 08:28.062
what you wanna do with Mom when the time
comes because we all know it's coming.

08:28.064 --> 08:29.663
We all know
how this thing works."

08:29.665 --> 08:31.298
- It's hard on him.
- Yeah.

08:31.300 --> 08:32.734
Well, you know what's
gonna be hard for him?

08:32.736 --> 08:34.302
When she turns up next week

08:34.304 --> 08:36.339
in a goddamn block of ice.

08:37.339 --> 08:40.008
It's over. She is not staying
in that condo anymore.

08:40.010 --> 08:43.080
She's going to a place,
and he's gonna have to let her.

08:44.747 --> 08:49.583
And if I hear one goddamn peep
about frickin' Florida,

08:49.585 --> 08:51.421
so help me God.

08:52.622 --> 08:53.623
What happened to quitting?

08:54.123 --> 08:56.960
Life, Bitty.
Life happened to quitting.

08:57.359 --> 08:59.394
You can't smoke in here,
I'm chemically sensitive.

08:59.396 --> 09:01.361
- You're who?
- Chemically sensitive.

09:01.363 --> 09:04.565
What kind of California
bullshit is that?

09:04.567 --> 09:06.634
[cell phone alarm blares]

09:06.636 --> 09:08.237
That's your ringer?

09:08.505 --> 09:09.473
For Dad it is.

09:11.507 --> 09:13.109
Hey, Pop.

09:20.416 --> 09:21.384
Dad.

09:23.085 --> 09:25.121
I told you not to call her.

09:25.387 --> 09:28.655
Bitty, it's Christmas. You oughta
be home with your husband.

09:28.657 --> 09:31.661
- Is she all right?
- She's swell, she's fine.

09:32.495 --> 09:34.562
- Hiya, sweets.
- Hi, Gramps, you okay?

09:34.564 --> 09:36.132
Yes, thank you.

09:36.399 --> 09:38.001
Oh. Nicholas.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.302
Damn it, I knew that you'd start
smoking again with that bar.

09:41.304 --> 09:43.504
Dad, are you all right? Have they
checked your blood pressure?

09:43.506 --> 09:45.539
- I'm fine.
- What'd the doctor say?

09:45.541 --> 09:48.375
- He hasn't been in yet.
- Then how do you know she's fine?

09:48.377 --> 09:51.814
Because she's fine. Go take a
look at her, down that hall.

09:55.684 --> 09:56.619
What?

10:11.834 --> 10:13.237
Mom.

10:14.603 --> 10:16.169
Is that my baby?

10:16.171 --> 10:17.707
- Yeah.
- Oh!

10:18.241 --> 10:20.707
- I'm so happy to see you.
- [chuckles]

10:20.709 --> 10:22.311
- You too.
- You all right, Mom?

10:23.179 --> 10:24.445
Oh, that's my baby, too.

10:24.447 --> 10:25.582
Yeah.

10:26.181 --> 10:28.151
Oh!

10:28.818 --> 10:30.650
- Honey!
- [Emma] Hi, Grandma.

10:30.652 --> 10:32.687
- [Ruth] Listen, do you need some money?
- No.

10:32.689 --> 10:34.121
Let me get you some money.

10:34.123 --> 10:35.822
- See she's fine.
- Where's my purse?

10:35.824 --> 10:37.859
- You don't need your purse, Ruth.
- Yes, I do, you turkey.

10:37.861 --> 10:40.230
- Sit down.
- Where the heck was she?

10:40.729 --> 10:42.763
- Aurora.
- Aurora?

10:42.765 --> 10:43.766
She got on the commuter.

10:44.333 --> 10:45.732
Rode the damn thing
back and forth

10:45.734 --> 10:48.336
until the conductor
finally screwed his eyeballs in.

10:48.338 --> 10:50.574
- Did she really?
- [Nick] Where did she get on at?

10:51.406 --> 10:53.109
- Berwyn.
- Hmm.

10:53.476 --> 10:56.376
She walked to Berwyn
in a snowstorm?

10:56.378 --> 10:57.912
She's fine, Nicholas.

10:57.914 --> 10:59.746
She doesn't look fine to me.

10:59.748 --> 11:01.883
- [Nick] She's fine, Mom.
- She's fine, Ruth.

11:01.885 --> 11:03.087
Excuse you,

11:03.419 --> 11:05.686
I was in geriatrics
for 30 years,

11:05.688 --> 11:07.091
thank you very much.

11:07.357 --> 11:08.492
Where's your diamond?

11:08.857 --> 11:11.491
Oh, um, I forgot to put it on.

11:11.493 --> 11:12.695
What do you mean, you forgot?

11:12.929 --> 11:14.461
- She doesn't wear it.
- [Bridget] Yes, I do.

11:14.463 --> 11:16.864
- I take it off for work.
- How come?

11:16.866 --> 11:20.136
Because I have my hands
in raw poultry all day. Ow, Mom.

11:20.370 --> 11:22.673
- That hurts.
- Did you guys go to mass last night?

11:22.905 --> 11:26.506
No, I... We were gonna go today.

11:26.508 --> 11:28.311
- [Emma] We were?
- Yeah.

11:28.611 --> 11:29.644
You were?

11:29.646 --> 11:31.180
Mm-hmm. Yes.

11:31.414 --> 11:33.650
- Come in.
- Are we ready for a pelvic exam?

11:34.784 --> 11:36.183
Pelvic exam?

11:36.185 --> 11:37.420
That's my baby.

11:38.420 --> 11:39.455
Hmm?

11:40.390 --> 11:42.822
[doctor] Now they are safer
in memory care,

11:42.824 --> 11:44.660
they also typically improve.

11:46.261 --> 11:49.532
Some of them feel more at home among
their peers than with their own family.

11:50.232 --> 11:52.268
As strange as that sounds.

11:54.404 --> 11:57.638
Look, the reason I did
a pelvic exam is because

11:57.640 --> 12:00.640
during wandering episodes,
women are often assaulted.

12:00.642 --> 12:01.677
Sexually.

12:02.511 --> 12:04.412
I didn't see
evidence of that today

12:04.414 --> 12:08.218
but I'd be very concerned
about her getting out again.

12:09.452 --> 12:10.420
Dad.

12:12.921 --> 12:14.724
- Hey, Dad.
- What?

12:16.693 --> 12:18.426
I'm on the street.

12:18.428 --> 12:20.461
So go then.
Ruth. Come on, honey.

12:20.463 --> 12:22.498
No, I'll take her with me.

12:23.699 --> 12:24.798
Come on.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.170
I'll go.

12:27.270 --> 12:29.236
- Bye.
- Am I going with you?

12:29.238 --> 12:30.439
[Nick] Yeah.

12:36.612 --> 12:38.712
Goddamn hospitals.

12:38.714 --> 12:41.651
Goddamn teenage doctors.

12:52.895 --> 12:54.463
What happened to the Camry?

12:54.697 --> 12:58.468
I'm 75 years old, Bitty.
Fuck the Camry.

13:00.703 --> 13:01.771
Let's go.

13:04.339 --> 13:06.006
[engine turns over]

13:06.008 --> 13:07.843
[music playing on stereo]

13:08.611 --> 13:10.043
[Bridget] It's a convertible.

13:10.045 --> 13:11.949
What about putting the top up?

13:12.348 --> 13:13.617
[Bert] I gotta fix that.

13:14.550 --> 13:17.221
This is a rocket, watch out.

13:18.288 --> 13:19.623
Like that?

13:36.572 --> 13:37.641
Hey.

13:38.808 --> 13:40.307
I got your lo mein.

13:40.309 --> 13:41.509
- Oh, yeah?
- [Bert] Where's your mother?

13:41.511 --> 13:43.043
She's in the back with Emma.

13:43.045 --> 13:44.348
[Bert] All right.

13:45.381 --> 13:46.580
[Bert groans]

13:46.582 --> 13:48.652
[click tongue] Hey, come here.

13:50.620 --> 13:52.919
- Come here. Come here.
- What?

13:52.921 --> 13:54.457
What? What's the matter?

13:55.058 --> 13:56.793
- She hit on me.
- Who?

13:58.026 --> 13:58.958
Not Emma.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.396
- Mom?
- Yeah.

14:00.663 --> 14:02.866
Yeah she put her hand
on my knee, and she was...

14:03.900 --> 14:06.803
looking at me like she wanted to...
She hit on me.

14:07.804 --> 14:08.704
What'd you do?

14:09.838 --> 14:12.907
- [stutters] I just kept calling her Mom.
- [chuckles]

14:12.909 --> 14:15.809
I said thanks, Mom.
It's nice to see you, too, Mom.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.947
I'm really glad
you birthed me, Mom.

14:18.348 --> 14:19.549
[laughs]

14:20.949 --> 14:24.688
- You're laughing. Don't laugh, you asshole.
- I'm sorry.

14:25.021 --> 14:26.887
No, I'm fucking traumatized.

14:26.889 --> 14:28.825
- Your face.
- My face?

14:29.825 --> 14:31.024
[blows raspberry]

14:31.026 --> 14:32.896
[both laughing]

14:33.096 --> 14:35.299
It's not funny.

14:39.135 --> 14:40.069
Hey.

14:41.103 --> 14:42.838
You want to go for a drive
with Uncle Nicky and me?

14:43.606 --> 14:46.543
No. Uncle Nicky is a dick.

14:46.742 --> 14:48.944
No he is not. Don't say that.

14:49.712 --> 14:51.881
Did you fill out your
new dorm application?

14:52.381 --> 14:53.449
Yeah.

14:53.982 --> 14:55.319
You did?

14:55.650 --> 14:56.553
Yes.

14:56.953 --> 14:57.853
All right. Well...

14:58.954 --> 15:00.790
are you sure you're gonna be
okay here by yourself?

15:03.693 --> 15:04.795
Okay.

15:05.862 --> 15:08.428
- Well, I have my cell.
- Oh, really, you do?

15:08.430 --> 15:10.499
Great, I'll call you.
We'll have a chat.

15:15.570 --> 15:17.440
[Bert] Don't...

15:19.141 --> 15:22.475
Don't let those guys
catch you with all of this.

15:22.477 --> 15:23.612
[chuckles]

15:27.983 --> 15:29.685
Let's go, dickie-doodle.

15:34.857 --> 15:37.557
- So Jimmy Laciak, remember him?
- [Bridget] Yup.

15:37.559 --> 15:39.592
[Nick] He sits on the board
of what's considered

15:39.594 --> 15:42.365
to be the best memory care place
in Chicago.

15:42.564 --> 15:44.030
They got a waiting list
a mile long,

15:44.032 --> 15:46.769
but he says he can get
Mom in there February one.

15:47.002 --> 15:50.937
And then a little two bedroom on the
same campus for dad by the 15th.

15:50.939 --> 15:52.673
They can't be together?

15:52.675 --> 15:54.908
Memory care's lock down,
dementia only.

15:54.910 --> 15:57.848
It's a bunch of loons. He'd be tearing
his hair out in there anyway.

15:58.514 --> 16:01.749
But his spot in assisted
living's like 50 yards away.

16:01.751 --> 16:03.551
He can go visit her
whenever he wants.

16:03.553 --> 16:05.655
What if he doesn't want
assisted living?

16:06.923 --> 16:10.025
Well, Daddy doesn't always
get what Daddy wants.

16:11.059 --> 16:15.663
It's not daycare, Bit. They
don't wipe his ass. It's nice.

16:15.665 --> 16:18.635
You know, they do his laundry,
give him a meal plan,

16:19.001 --> 16:22.439
and if he gets a chest pain, all
he gotta do is press a button.

16:23.005 --> 16:25.605
- [car alarm chirps]
- What about a live-in person?

16:25.607 --> 16:26.941
Insurance doesn't cover it.

16:26.943 --> 16:28.509
It doesn't cover
memory care either.

16:28.511 --> 16:30.076
Well, it covers some of it

16:30.078 --> 16:31.211
and then he sells the condo.

16:31.213 --> 16:32.613
He's not gonna sell the condo.

16:32.615 --> 16:33.884
What's he gonna do
take it with him?

16:34.550 --> 16:35.684
Oh.

16:36.618 --> 16:39.220
Oh, my God! Is that you?
Are you Nick?

16:39.222 --> 16:42.255
Oh, no. That's the other owner.
His name's Nick, too.

16:42.257 --> 16:43.859
Well... [chuckles]

16:44.160 --> 16:46.793
Of course it's me,
you dingleberry.

16:46.795 --> 16:49.965
Well, how am I supposed
to know, you never told me.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.568
Yeah.

16:56.506 --> 16:57.904
Wow.

16:57.906 --> 17:00.707
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. It's gorgeous.

17:00.709 --> 17:03.543
Yeah. See?
It's not some shitty dive.

17:03.545 --> 17:05.549
Who said it was a shitty dive?

17:06.146 --> 17:09.617
- Well, has he been here?
- Of course he hasn't been here.

17:09.952 --> 17:10.987
Did you invite him?

17:11.287 --> 17:12.955
I shouldn't have to invite him.

17:20.127 --> 17:21.595
Somebody's living here.

17:21.597 --> 17:23.596
You're one sharp cookie, Bit.

17:23.598 --> 17:24.731
[Bridget] Who?

17:24.733 --> 17:26.267
[Nick] The other owner.

17:26.269 --> 17:27.733
You're living here?

17:27.736 --> 17:29.538
- Yeah.
- What about Rachel?

17:31.773 --> 17:32.708
Shh!

17:33.242 --> 17:34.810
What do you mean, "shh"?

17:36.244 --> 17:37.713
What do you wanna drink?

17:39.915 --> 17:43.086
Come on, loosen up.
It's the holidays.

17:45.620 --> 17:46.720
Norbert's Manhattan.

17:46.722 --> 17:48.154
- That's it.
- That's it.

17:48.156 --> 17:49.259
Good choice.

17:50.693 --> 17:54.931
This is going to be the best Manhattan
you ever have in your life.

17:55.731 --> 17:57.200
You'll shit your pants.

17:58.267 --> 18:01.769
This is... I just love that
you used Dad's farm up here.

18:01.771 --> 18:03.237
Yeah, if you
look very closely,

18:03.239 --> 18:05.675
you'll notice that it's
freezing fucking cold.

18:08.210 --> 18:12.848
- Emma, she's a real peach these days.
- Yeah.

18:13.648 --> 18:14.950
I think she hates me.

18:15.216 --> 18:19.655
- For what?
- I don't know. She doesn't talk to me.

18:20.790 --> 18:22.122
Maybe she's pregnant.

18:22.124 --> 18:26.359
Oh, God. No, please. God.

18:26.361 --> 18:27.795
You never know.

18:27.797 --> 18:29.732
That's unimaginable.

18:30.665 --> 18:32.900
- All right.
- Thank you.

18:32.902 --> 18:34.069
Mm-hmm.

18:40.076 --> 18:41.044
Shit.

18:41.376 --> 18:42.779
What?

18:43.346 --> 18:44.644
In my pants.

18:44.646 --> 18:46.814
[laughs]

18:46.816 --> 18:47.983
That was quick.

18:48.783 --> 18:52.088
Yeah, that thing's won an award.

18:52.687 --> 18:54.823
- Mmm.
- An award.

18:57.092 --> 18:58.561
What happened with Rachel?

18:59.095 --> 19:00.564
Oh, who knows.

19:02.331 --> 19:05.965
All of a sudden, she's bursting into tears
over a hamburger 'cause I haven't proposed.

19:05.967 --> 19:08.203
She's been waiting for you
to wanna marry her, dummy.

19:08.671 --> 19:10.574
Nobody wants to ask
to be proposed to.

19:10.873 --> 19:11.875
You gotta be intuitive.

19:12.809 --> 19:15.578
- You know, it's like Eddie, right?
- Mm-hmm.

19:16.078 --> 19:19.214
I'm constantly telling him
that chefs hate kitchen gadgets,

19:19.915 --> 19:22.115
but what does he put
under the tree every year?

19:22.117 --> 19:24.020
I think, that's cause
you open it and go,

19:24.386 --> 19:26.053
"Wow! A coconut roaster!

19:26.055 --> 19:29.056
Oh, my God. Thank you.
I love it so much!"

19:29.058 --> 19:32.162
- What am I supposed to say?
- "No thanks, where's the receipt?"

19:32.994 --> 19:34.862
- I can't say that.
- Why not?

19:34.864 --> 19:36.199
Because, I don't...

19:37.465 --> 19:38.699
you know, I don't wanna make him
feel bad in front of the girls.

19:38.701 --> 19:41.067
- It's just annoying.
- That's just what the world needs,

19:41.069 --> 19:43.369
two more women who don't
tell you what's really going on.

19:43.371 --> 19:44.740
Two more Rachels.

19:46.975 --> 19:48.712
She told you what's going on.

19:50.413 --> 19:52.781
Go over there
and bring her flowers.

19:54.015 --> 19:57.620
She's trying to get full custody
of her kid now, so...

19:58.053 --> 19:58.988
So?

19:59.387 --> 20:02.091
What? I'm gonna be a parent?

20:02.857 --> 20:04.991
- Why not? Yeah.
- Why not?

20:04.993 --> 20:07.297
Bitty, you got any idea
what I got goin' on here?

20:08.431 --> 20:12.900
I got my life savings dumped into this
place, and I barely make payroll.

20:12.902 --> 20:14.804
I got the fire department,
the health department

20:16.405 --> 20:18.774
double, triple fining me for shit I
didn't even know I wasn't supposed to do.

20:19.040 --> 20:21.144
My barback
is stealing my tips,

20:21.409 --> 20:22.344
and then...

20:23.378 --> 20:26.081
I get to pick up
Mom and Pop's prescriptions,

20:26.315 --> 20:28.918
pick up their dry cleaning.
Take them to church.

20:32.754 --> 20:33.889
Here.

20:35.090 --> 20:36.789
I filled out all the paperwork.

20:36.791 --> 20:37.961
All he's gotta do is sign it.

20:38.728 --> 20:40.797
- The Reminisce Neighborhood?
- Yeah.

20:41.097 --> 20:42.932
They're all called
shit like that.

20:47.368 --> 20:49.204
Here, put this in your purse.

20:54.976 --> 20:56.845
You got your big girl pants on?

20:58.146 --> 21:00.817
- What?
- Just don't get how you get.

21:01.317 --> 21:04.921
- What do you mean, how I get? Don't get how you get.
- How do I get?

21:05.253 --> 21:07.386
You can't even tell him
you're not a Catholic anymore.

21:07.388 --> 21:09.222
What's he gonna do,
perform an exorcism?

21:09.224 --> 21:11.357
That's because I'm tired
of the third degree.

21:11.359 --> 21:14.396
Yeah, you know what you do when
Dad gives you the third degree?

21:15.063 --> 21:17.199
Yeah. See, that's how you get.

21:20.368 --> 21:21.838
All right.

21:23.772 --> 21:25.140
So disgusting.

21:31.312 --> 21:32.848
[Bridget] Hi, Dad.

21:34.316 --> 21:36.249
- You smell like an ashtray, Nicholas.
- [Nick] Yeah,

21:36.251 --> 21:37.984
it took you four
heart attacks to quit.

21:37.986 --> 21:40.921
Yeah, Rachel probably wants
to throttle you.

21:40.923 --> 21:42.291
- They broke up.
- Ah.

21:43.058 --> 21:44.327
- Just being honest.
- Mmm.

21:44.827 --> 21:45.795
I don't blame her.

21:46.127 --> 21:47.928
Been on and off
since high school,

21:47.930 --> 21:49.128
shit or get off the pot.

21:49.130 --> 21:51.198
Oh, gee, Dad, that's romantic.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.236
- You know what your problem is?
- Dad.

21:53.868 --> 21:55.536
You're waiting for some feeling.

21:55.538 --> 21:57.371
There's no bells and whistles.

21:57.373 --> 22:01.407
You pick somebody you can stand,
and you make a commitment.

22:01.409 --> 22:03.410
- Dad.
- Have her meet us at church tomorrow.

22:03.412 --> 22:06.316
Marion-Down-The-Hall's
coming over with a corned beef.

22:07.249 --> 22:08.918
- Dad.
- What?

22:10.819 --> 22:12.288
We need to talk about Mom.

22:13.021 --> 22:15.489
[sighs] Goddamn
teaching hospital.

22:15.491 --> 22:18.357
That little girl should never have
been left anywhere near your mother.

22:18.359 --> 22:22.298
- What little girl?
- The teenager pretending to be a doctor.

22:22.498 --> 22:24.434
Your mother is doing fine.

22:24.834 --> 22:27.134
So, wandering off in the middle
of the night's doing fine?

22:27.136 --> 22:31.070
Well, I gave her too much
scotch, which I never do,

22:31.072 --> 22:34.040
but it was Christmas Eve
so I said, "What the hell."

22:34.042 --> 22:35.909
[Nick] So, what, she walked off
'cause she was drunk?

22:35.911 --> 22:38.578
She can't drink hardly at all
with the medication she's taking.

22:38.580 --> 22:43.317
No, Dad, she walked off because
that's what happens with stage six.

22:43.319 --> 22:47.019
Those stages are horseshit,
everybody's brain is different...

22:47.021 --> 22:48.555
- [Nick] Goddammit.
- ...and everybody knows it.

22:48.557 --> 22:51.290
- Everybody except the doctor?
- She was not a doctor.

22:51.292 --> 22:55.497
Okay, all right.
So, we'll get a second opinion.

22:55.964 --> 22:59.399
I got an appointment next week with
her geriatrician down in Florida.

22:59.401 --> 23:03.303
Oh, my God.
Dad, you cannot go to Florida!

23:03.305 --> 23:06.606
- [shushes] You're gonna wake Mom.
- We are too going to Florida.

23:06.608 --> 23:08.977
I already put down a deposit.

23:09.944 --> 23:11.280
Dad, listen.

23:11.946 --> 23:13.512
There's this place
that Nicky found,

23:13.514 --> 23:15.414
and it looks like it
could be a really...

23:15.416 --> 23:18.120
I am not putting your mother
in a nursing home.

23:18.486 --> 23:21.054
She spent 30 years
working in nursing homes.

23:21.056 --> 23:23.257
They're horrible,
and I'm not doing it to her.

23:23.259 --> 23:26.660
Dad, It's not
a nursing home, all right?

23:26.662 --> 23:29.128
- It's Reminisce Neighborhood.
- What?

23:29.130 --> 23:30.499
Reminisce Neighborhood.

23:31.165 --> 23:34.102
Yeah, it's great.
They got Mass twice a week,

23:34.302 --> 23:37.203
a restaurant, art classes,
a Jacuzzi.

23:37.205 --> 23:38.107
Jacuzzi?

23:39.374 --> 23:41.173
Your mother can't swim. What do you want?
To drown her?

23:41.175 --> 23:43.277
You cannot drown in a Jacuzzi.

23:43.279 --> 23:45.011
She's terrified
of water Nicholas.

23:45.013 --> 23:46.512
Yeah, she used to be
terrified of Berwyn,

23:46.514 --> 23:48.649
now she's walking around
down there in her nightie.

23:48.651 --> 23:50.854
- [shushing]
- [Bert] Yeah.

23:51.086 --> 23:53.953
Now there's a two bedroom
right next door,

23:53.955 --> 23:56.455
50 yards away in assisted living
for you, okay.

23:56.457 --> 23:59.061
Are you out of your mind?

23:59.294 --> 24:01.528
Bitty feels the same way, right.

24:01.530 --> 24:04.434
How the hell do you know what
Bitty feels, how do you know?

24:07.202 --> 24:07.971
Dad, I...

24:08.972 --> 24:11.907
I think this is a solution
worth considering.

24:14.242 --> 24:18.181
Well, I've been thinking
about this for eight years

24:18.947 --> 24:20.382
and the answer is no.

24:21.783 --> 24:24.953
Thank you for your suggestion.
Merry Christmas. I'm going to bed.

24:29.157 --> 24:32.558
- I tried.
- She wandered off in the middle of a fucking snowstorm.

24:32.560 --> 24:35.898
- [shushing]
- [Bert] Doesn't snow in Florida.

24:37.165 --> 24:38.501
And mind your language.

24:39.167 --> 24:43.039
[door opens and closes]

24:45.540 --> 24:48.377
Strong, real strong.

24:57.152 --> 24:59.521
[siren wails in distance]

25:04.193 --> 25:05.528
I'm not going to force him.

25:09.030 --> 25:11.501
You know why she
wound up in Aurora?

25:14.336 --> 25:16.673
'Cause that liner used
to run to Amboy.

25:17.205 --> 25:19.442
Her dad worked that train.

25:21.476 --> 25:23.211
She was trying to go home.

25:26.181 --> 25:28.318
She thinks she's still
a little girl,

25:29.283 --> 25:31.954
and she thinks her parents
are worried sick about her.

25:34.356 --> 25:37.193
And all she wants to do is
get home to her poor mother.

25:38.059 --> 25:40.363
She can't figure out
why she's stuck here,

25:40.762 --> 25:43.366
all alone, with some
strange, old dude.

25:51.572 --> 25:54.476
What the hell do you think
power of attorney is for?

26:00.348 --> 26:01.483
Goodnight.

26:34.750 --> 26:36.386
I thought you went to bed.

26:36.617 --> 26:39.254
I did. I got back up.

26:41.790 --> 26:43.192
Nice tree.

26:43.826 --> 26:45.361
Your mother likes the pictures.

26:46.627 --> 26:49.165
She did something with the
ornaments, so I got creative.

26:49.565 --> 26:51.434
Come on, I'll let
you win a game.

26:53.367 --> 26:55.167
You're not too tired?

26:55.169 --> 26:57.439
For my daughter
who never visits?

27:06.714 --> 27:09.215
Emma said she got kicked out
of her dorm.

27:09.217 --> 27:10.719
- What's that all about?
- Yeah.

27:11.486 --> 27:14.456
Yeah. She got caught drinking,
so stupid.

27:15.424 --> 27:17.193
But you know
what her problem is?

27:17.492 --> 27:20.096
She's negative.
She doesn't get any exercise.

27:20.462 --> 27:22.732
Oh. Her problem is
she's not a student.

27:23.264 --> 27:27.203
College is a waste of time, waste
of money if you're not a student.

27:29.370 --> 27:30.839
She's gotta get a degree.

27:31.240 --> 27:33.472
No, she doesn't have
to get a degree.

27:33.474 --> 27:37.079
She'll figure it out.
Look at you, you figured it out.

27:40.616 --> 27:42.218
Why can't you sleep?

27:43.284 --> 27:44.619
Why can't you sleep?

27:45.186 --> 27:46.388
I can sleep.

27:50.459 --> 27:53.362
I'm sorry. I ought
to be here more often.

27:54.896 --> 27:56.398
You're here plenty.

27:57.499 --> 27:59.499
You got family, you got girls,

27:59.501 --> 28:01.535
you got a husband,
you got a job.

28:01.537 --> 28:04.273
You live halfway across
the country for Chrissake.

28:04.705 --> 28:05.640
We're fine.

28:05.941 --> 28:07.641
Marion-Down-The-Hall's helpful.

28:07.643 --> 28:11.547
She takes mom
on poker night and whatnot.

28:13.514 --> 28:16.916
The two of them,
a couple of peas in a pod.

28:16.918 --> 28:18.852
Both battier than hell.

28:18.854 --> 28:21.557
You take great care of her.

28:21.924 --> 28:23.757
But it's gotta be hard on you.

28:23.759 --> 28:25.261
Oh, Honey.

28:25.927 --> 28:28.463
Your mother was always
a pain in the ass.

28:29.630 --> 28:32.332
Gettin' her Irish up,
stompin' around,

28:32.334 --> 28:35.605
all red in the face
over God knows what.

28:36.972 --> 28:39.407
There's no bells
and whistles, Bit.

28:40.375 --> 28:42.545
Love is commitment.

28:45.681 --> 28:46.716
Better or worse,

36:06.955 --> 36:08.254
Because that's
not how it works.

How it works is she gets worse.

every year she gets worse.

You know what?
Let me ask you something.

What'd you fly all
the way out here for? Why?

Because Mom was missing.

38:59.560 --> 39:01.863
No, because I asked you to.

Isn't that right?
I asked you to.

I never do that, okay.
But I need some help.

- There's no time to work on it.

That's a big ass deal,

and he was supposed to have
the paperwork two days ago.

coming in with moving boxes."

Oh, come on. It's just
like a chocolate malt.

41:20.100 --> 41:23.472
Oh, yeah. You wouldn't know a chocolate
malt if it bit you in the hiney.

41:24.138 --> 41:26.441
Because I was a fountain girl.

41:26.707 --> 41:29.310
I was a good fountain girl.

41:30.577 --> 41:31.676
[stutters] In...

41:31.678 --> 41:33.314
- Amboy.
- Amboy, yeah.

41:34.448 --> 41:35.316
My...

41:36.383 --> 41:40.185
My father, consequently,
works on the trains,

41:40.187 --> 41:43.122
- and he's a...
- Engineer.

41:43.124 --> 41:45.290
An engineer, that's right,

41:45.292 --> 41:47.325
and he was an engineer
and he would get off the train

41:47.327 --> 41:50.331
and he would bring me
chocolate malts. [slurps]

41:51.631 --> 41:53.232
[Bert] Yeah.

41:53.234 --> 41:56.569
Oh, boy. Because I was sick.
Yeah, I had...

41:56.571 --> 41:57.602
You had Polio.

41:57.604 --> 42:00.141
Polio. Yeah, I had Polio.

42:00.441 --> 42:05.611
And then that's all I did all day
was drink those chocolate malts,

42:05.613 --> 42:07.779
and consequently I...

42:07.781 --> 42:09.216
- Got fat.
- Fat!

42:09.649 --> 42:11.252
- Dad.
- What?

42:11.752 --> 42:13.084
She wasn't fat.

42:13.086 --> 42:14.088
She was very fat.

42:14.354 --> 42:17.258
Yeah, I was very, very fat.

42:17.792 --> 42:20.362
And then I was a housewife,

42:20.560 --> 42:24.263
- You were not.
- No, you were a career woman, Ruth.

42:24.265 --> 42:28.136
You were two-time
Administrator of the Year.

42:29.037 --> 42:30.305
Holy shit.

42:31.638 --> 42:33.207
I knew that.

42:36.077 --> 42:37.479
How do you two know each other?

42:39.546 --> 42:42.117
She's our daughter,
for Chrissake, Ruth.

42:45.586 --> 42:47.189
I'm gonna get my purse.

42:49.624 --> 42:51.122
Don't touch anything.

42:51.124 --> 42:52.792
I'm not gonna touch anything.

42:52.794 --> 42:54.396
I'm getting my purse.

42:57.330 --> 42:59.468
We're going to Edna's
for dinner tonight.

43:02.269 --> 43:03.771
You feel like doing me a favor?

43:04.805 --> 43:07.138
- [Ruth exclaims]
- [Bridget] Here give me your hand.

43:07.140 --> 43:08.510
- [Ruth] It's your turn.
- Wait.

43:08.810 --> 43:10.542
In here?

43:10.544 --> 43:12.278
Rub that in your hair.

43:12.280 --> 43:14.448
Yeah. There you go.

43:15.615 --> 43:17.716
Don't get soap
in your eyes, Mom.

43:17.718 --> 43:19.250
Close your eyes.

43:19.252 --> 43:22.457
You're so nice
to do this for me.

43:23.191 --> 43:24.559
You did it for me.

43:25.792 --> 43:28.694
- Yeah. I did, didn't I?
- Yeah.

43:28.696 --> 43:31.366
[snickers] Oh, God.

43:32.566 --> 43:37.569
Nicky hated the bath.
He would kick and scream.

43:37.571 --> 43:40.408
Ah! Then I said,
"Oh, to hell with it."

43:40.640 --> 43:42.476
I just let him be dirty.

43:42.877 --> 43:45.047
But you were a good girl.

43:48.548 --> 43:50.651
I should've been
a better mother.

43:52.586 --> 43:54.121
You are a great mom.

43:59.727 --> 44:01.727
Do I need to wash my hair?

44:01.729 --> 44:03.229
No, you already did,
you're done.

44:03.231 --> 44:04.729
Wash your who-who.

44:04.731 --> 44:06.100
Who-who.

44:06.734 --> 44:10.472
Well, you got a cute
little tushie. [chuckles]

44:11.671 --> 44:13.207
Where's... give me that.

44:16.743 --> 44:18.379
Do you have a boyfriend?

44:19.747 --> 44:21.283
I have a husband.

44:23.618 --> 44:25.087
Are you happy?

44:27.854 --> 44:29.223
I'm lonely.

44:32.426 --> 44:34.129
Do I need to wash my hair?

44:34.495 --> 44:37.696
No, here.
Mom, rinse your who-who.

44:37.698 --> 44:39.367
- My who-who.
- Yeah.

44:39.633 --> 44:41.702
[exclaims]

44:42.236 --> 44:44.205
[laughs]

44:48.276 --> 44:50.145
[Ruth] Oh, I don't
wanna upset her.

44:50.377 --> 44:52.343
- [Bridget] Who?
- Whoever's shoes those are.

44:52.345 --> 44:53.779
Those are your shoes, Mom. Here.

44:53.781 --> 44:55.480
They are not. I...

44:55.482 --> 44:58.185
Those are the ugliest things
I've seen in my life.

44:58.653 --> 45:01.352
Come on, Mom. Put your shoes on.
Marion is waiting for you.

45:01.354 --> 45:02.787
Marion. I'm going with you?

45:02.789 --> 45:04.656
[Marion] Yeah. Hey, doll.

45:04.658 --> 45:05.794
Good. Hi.

45:06.394 --> 45:08.761
[softly] Get the folder.
Get the folder.

45:08.763 --> 45:10.531
Just let me get dressed.

45:20.941 --> 45:23.611
Did you go into my computer
and log into my school account?

45:26.214 --> 45:26.948
Somebody did.

45:27.582 --> 45:29.348
Somebody went in
and signed me up

45:29.350 --> 45:31.486
for a bunch of random
classes. That wasn't you?

45:31.752 --> 45:32.687
No.

45:33.955 --> 45:35.257
Liar.

45:37.624 --> 45:38.592
How does it feel?

45:39.693 --> 45:42.396
You lied to me about filling
out your dorm application.

45:42.796 --> 45:44.696
Because I didn't
want you on me. Okay?

45:44.698 --> 45:47.601
I didn't feel like dealing
with your crazy hovering.

45:48.568 --> 45:49.771
Were you ever going to do it?

45:51.839 --> 45:52.805
Huh?

45:52.807 --> 45:54.509
- Yes.
- When?

45:56.711 --> 45:58.847
When I decided whether
or not I was going back.

45:59.446 --> 46:00.745
- Okay?
- Where's the...

46:00.747 --> 46:02.615
Doesn't anybody know
how to knock?

46:02.617 --> 46:04.450
- Do you mind?
- Hey, I'm not looking. Where's the folder?

46:04.452 --> 46:06.187
- Nick. Why would you do that?
- Come on.

46:06.386 --> 46:09.323
- Would you get out here, Bitty. Damn it.
- Just give me a minute!

46:09.723 --> 46:10.624
God.

46:11.959 --> 46:14.328
I am a grown up, okay?

46:14.861 --> 46:17.662
God, you make me feel like
there's something wrong with me.

46:17.664 --> 46:19.733
- There's nothing wrong with you.
- Yeah, I know.

46:22.937 --> 46:26.272
I would have given anything
to go to college, Emma.

46:26.274 --> 46:27.305
I know.

46:27.307 --> 46:29.210
You have no perspective.

46:29.709 --> 46:32.213
You have no idea
how lucky you are.

46:34.814 --> 46:36.784
Do you think I'm trying
to hate school?

46:37.017 --> 46:39.484
You think I don't want to get
out of bed in the morning?

46:39.486 --> 46:44.022
That I like lying there feeling like
a piece of shit for blowing it,

46:44.024 --> 46:45.559
for wasting Dad's money?

46:46.026 --> 46:48.493
Laying there thinking about
how much you wanted to go

46:48.495 --> 46:51.863
until I wanna throw myself out the
window because I can't take it,

46:51.865 --> 46:53.634
you think that's fun for me?

46:53.934 --> 46:56.338
Honey. Why didn't you tell me?

46:56.537 --> 46:57.305
[scoffs]

46:58.205 --> 46:59.370
'Cause you would just try
to get me to go

46:59.372 --> 47:00.774
on one of your stupid runs.

47:01.475 --> 47:03.511
Like you're not a fucking mess.

47:04.312 --> 47:05.647
I am not a mess.

47:08.515 --> 47:11.917
[Nick] This is ridiculous, Dad. Come
on, This is silly. I know it's hard,

47:11.919 --> 47:16.992
but I'm begging you, okay? This is
the best memory care in Chicago!

47:17.390 --> 47:18.792
Let me tell you something,

47:19.459 --> 47:21.593
those pictures on
the tree in there,

47:21.595 --> 47:23.395
tell her how
she takes her coffee,

47:23.397 --> 47:25.064
how many ice cubes
she likes in her scotch.

47:25.066 --> 47:26.468
That's memory care.

47:27.635 --> 47:29.600
I was there for every memory
she made in last 60 years,

47:29.602 --> 47:32.604
and if I wasn't there, I heard
about it at least 37 times,

47:32.606 --> 47:35.542
so I am the best
memory care in Chicago!

47:35.843 --> 47:37.542
I bathe her, I feed her,

47:37.544 --> 47:39.712
I give her her pills,
I wipe her ass

47:39.714 --> 47:42.348
and I do it a hell
of a lot better than some aide,

47:42.350 --> 47:43.816
who does not give
one goddamn hoot

47:43.818 --> 47:46.287
about over who she spent
60 years becoming!

47:46.687 --> 47:48.354
Put some clothes on, we're late.

47:48.356 --> 47:49.888
And get rid of that thing.

47:49.890 --> 47:52.661
I don't want your
mother to see it. Goddamn it!

47:56.097 --> 47:58.464
You couldn't have
waited one minute, Nick?

47:58.466 --> 48:02.133
Couldn't wait? Couldn't wait? What!
What the fuck am I even doing?

48:02.135 --> 48:03.502
[Emma Sobs]

48:03.504 --> 48:05.006
Ah, Jesus.

48:05.606 --> 48:07.075
What's the matter with you, huh?

48:07.707 --> 48:10.311
- It's sad!
- It's sad, Nicky, God!

48:15.615 --> 48:16.850
[Nick] Hey, hey, hey.

48:17.450 --> 48:18.619
Calm down.

48:18.852 --> 48:21.419
[sighs] Just what are you,
dead inside?

48:21.421 --> 48:22.490
Almost.

48:24.557 --> 48:27.859
I don't want to go
to Edna's. I hate Edna.

48:27.861 --> 48:30.162
All she ever does is talk about
her stupid hip replacement.

48:30.164 --> 48:31.700
Well then don't go.

48:35.935 --> 48:37.504
Wanna stay with me?

48:38.004 --> 48:39.707
- No.
- Come on.

48:42.510 --> 48:44.845
I'll just tell Dad
you got menopause.

48:51.017 --> 48:52.519
[door closes]

49:19.513 --> 49:20.848
[coughs]

49:30.825 --> 49:33.428
Hi. Is this
Hoffsteader Construction?

49:33.928 --> 49:38.566
Oh, yeah. Is this Gerry?
Hi, it's Bitty.

49:38.798 --> 49:43.405
Yeah. Hi. Hi, yeah, listen...

49:43.771 --> 49:47.408
You guys don't happen
to do locks, do you?

50:39.693 --> 50:41.026
[doorbell rings]

50:41.028 --> 50:42.163
Shit.

50:43.129 --> 50:45.296
I was thinking about a lock
with the key,

50:45.298 --> 50:47.265
but with the key
on the inside, you know?

50:47.267 --> 50:49.968
Yeah, yeah, all right. So,
you know, you lock the door,

50:49.970 --> 50:51.270
- hide the key from her.
- Yeah, exactly.

50:51.272 --> 50:53.138
Got it. It's smart. Uh...

50:53.140 --> 50:55.540
Okay, yeah. Do you want this,
back door, too?

50:55.542 --> 50:56.741
- Yes, that would be great.
- Okay.

50:56.743 --> 50:58.877
If you have time,
I don't want...

50:58.879 --> 51:01.583
I got, for you,
all the time in the world.

51:01.948 --> 51:04.818
Uh, I mean, it's not
gonna take all day.

51:05.553 --> 51:08.020
- Okay.
- It'll be like, about half hour.

51:08.022 --> 51:09.557
- Okay.
- Each.

51:10.323 --> 51:12.124
- Um...
- So, yeah.

51:12.126 --> 51:14.560
Hey, do you want a...
There's a sandwich...

51:14.562 --> 51:17.162
There's corned beef from
Marion-Down-The-Hall.

51:17.164 --> 51:18.964
There's a lot of leftovers,

51:18.966 --> 51:21.169
and I don't know,
coffee or something.

51:22.202 --> 51:25.736
- Yes.
- Okay. Great. I'll just... I'll get it.

51:25.738 --> 51:27.573
[music playing]

51:27.575 --> 51:31.078
He's a fantastic guy.
He really...

51:32.046 --> 51:33.181
He really is.

51:33.948 --> 51:36.518
It's just, you know.
He's a checklist guy.

51:37.084 --> 51:39.584
College, check.
Corporate law, check.

51:39.586 --> 51:40.919
Wife, kids, check, check, check.

51:40.921 --> 51:44.658
Which is fine,
you know, but I'm not.

51:45.091 --> 51:49.060
And so, I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be telling you all this stuff,

51:49.062 --> 51:50.328
I just don't...

51:50.330 --> 51:52.897
I don't... What is...
What's...

51:52.899 --> 51:54.001
Here.

52:01.774 --> 52:04.676
I mean, I was 20
when we got married.

52:04.678 --> 52:06.214
- Good God.
- Yeah.

52:06.946 --> 52:10.084
Oh, my... That's Emma's age.

52:10.751 --> 52:13.021
- Yeah.
- And she can barely tie her shoes.

52:14.220 --> 52:15.556
And Mary.

52:15.823 --> 52:18.189
Mary at 20, she thought
she was a lesbian.

52:18.191 --> 52:22.093
Now she's out in Sacramento
with her fiancé.

52:22.095 --> 52:23.564
Hey, you want...

52:24.330 --> 52:26.064
- Want a cigarette?
- Absolutely.

52:26.066 --> 52:28.236
Oh, God. I haven't had
a cigarette in like 20 years.

52:28.635 --> 52:30.037
- These are my daughter's.
- Thank you.

52:30.336 --> 52:33.640
- I don't really drink either.
- Don't jack 'em.

52:37.711 --> 52:39.111
[chuckles]
You really don't smoke.

52:39.113 --> 52:40.245
Oh. I'm sorry.

52:40.247 --> 52:41.716
Mm-hmm.

52:42.249 --> 52:44.185
[Bridget laughs]

52:44.718 --> 52:45.920
That's a trick.

52:47.720 --> 52:50.857
- Mmm. Here. Yeah.
- Thank you.

52:54.894 --> 52:57.598
You know, everyone thinks
being alone is so bad.

52:58.131 --> 53:01.668
So... lonely. Mmm.

53:03.403 --> 53:05.005
You know what's lonely?

53:06.205 --> 53:09.142
Lying awake in the middle of the
night thinking, "This is it.

53:09.977 --> 53:13.011
This is the rest of my life,
this is as good as it gets."

53:13.013 --> 53:15.147
And then looking over at
the man you've been married to

53:15.149 --> 53:19.721
for the last 20 years and
thinking, he must be awake, too.

53:20.053 --> 53:20.821
Right?

53:21.622 --> 53:24.258
He must be feeling
the same way I am.

53:24.758 --> 53:28.830
But looking over at him to see
him sleeping like a baby?

53:29.729 --> 53:32.766
That. That is lonely.

53:36.035 --> 53:36.937
Yeah.

53:46.312 --> 53:47.347
I get it.

53:47.781 --> 53:50.118
- I'm divorced, too.
- Oh. Um...

53:50.783 --> 53:52.854
- I'm sorry. Listen I'm...
- God you smell good.

53:53.754 --> 53:55.656
You always fucking
smell so good.

53:56.156 --> 53:57.191
What? Oh.

53:58.091 --> 53:59.491
- Wait, I'm sorry.
- [Nick] Hey, Ger!

53:59.493 --> 54:01.663
What? Oh!

54:03.097 --> 54:04.031
Whoops.

54:05.298 --> 54:06.865
- 'Sup, Nick.
- Hey.

54:06.867 --> 54:08.403
What happened with Edna?

54:08.836 --> 54:10.671
- She died.
- [Bridget] What?

54:10.970 --> 54:12.873
Yeah. She died this morning.

54:14.006 --> 54:16.341
Nah, I'm just screwing with you.
She's in the hospital.

54:16.343 --> 54:19.944
Did you change the locks? Everybody's
standing at the front door.

54:19.946 --> 54:21.178
You should let them in.

54:21.180 --> 54:22.684
Oh, shit.

54:23.149 --> 54:24.251
Yup.

54:29.323 --> 54:33.060
- [knocking on the door]
- Shit. I'm just gonna get the door.

54:36.363 --> 54:37.832
[music stops]

54:40.133 --> 54:42.834
Hi. I'm sorry. I couldn't
hear you, I had music on.

54:42.836 --> 54:45.006
- The heck's going on in here?
- Sorry, Dad.

54:45.972 --> 54:47.471
- Smoking in here?
- No.

54:47.473 --> 54:49.943
- Are you my baby?
- Smoking in my house?

54:50.943 --> 54:52.877
- You are too smoking in my house.
- No, I'm not, Dad.

54:52.879 --> 54:55.383
- I am so happy to see you.
- Oh, you, too.

54:56.115 --> 54:57.482
What the heck are you wearing?

54:57.484 --> 54:59.153
- Who?
- Oh, I...

54:59.787 --> 55:01.051
Is that your mother's
good blouse?

55:01.053 --> 55:02.386
- I got hot.
- Whose mother?

55:02.388 --> 55:03.821
I only had that sweater.
You know? Hi, honey.

55:03.823 --> 55:05.256
I just got it dry cleaned.

55:05.258 --> 55:07.394
Who's that? Who is that?

55:07.827 --> 55:08.826
- Who?
- Who's who?

55:08.828 --> 55:09.763
This.

55:10.897 --> 55:13.767
That's Gerry Hoffsteader.
Remember, Dad? From Mass.

55:14.001 --> 55:15.836
Nice to see you again,
Mr. Everhardt.

55:16.403 --> 55:19.837
Dad, it's Gerry. Hoffsteader.
He's a construction guy.

55:19.839 --> 55:23.475
He did... Did you see the Hoffsteader
Construction truck outside?

55:23.477 --> 55:28.382
He's a construction guy. We haven't seen
each other since, I don't know, like...

55:28.981 --> 55:30.549
- Was it junior high? Right?
- Yeah, junior high.

55:30.551 --> 55:33.852
Yeah. Well except for Mass where
you saw him. Where we all...

55:33.854 --> 55:36.020
[laughing]

55:36.022 --> 55:37.888
- What is so funny?
- You're wearing Mom's blouse.

55:37.890 --> 55:40.058
- We were just hanging out...
- That's sexy.

55:40.060 --> 55:41.493
...after he put the locks in.

55:41.495 --> 55:43.395
Hey, you know Dad
just got that dry cleaned.

55:43.397 --> 55:45.162
...which is why I called him,
was to put in locks

55:45.164 --> 55:47.031
like they have
at the Reminisce community.

55:47.033 --> 55:48.200
No, it's a neighborhood.

55:48.202 --> 55:50.435
So when you put that in,
you know,

55:50.437 --> 55:52.169
you lock it and you put the key,

55:52.171 --> 55:53.939
you hide the key and that
way she can't get out.

55:53.941 --> 55:56.010
And then you guys can stay.

55:56.577 --> 55:58.042
- What?
- For now.

55:58.044 --> 56:00.178
Well, as long as you
don't go to Florida.

56:00.180 --> 56:03.415
I know, you're the husband!

56:03.417 --> 56:05.584
- Good, good.
- No.

56:05.586 --> 56:07.084
That's not...

56:07.086 --> 56:08.319
Look everybody,
look who I found.

56:08.321 --> 56:09.587
- That's not the husband, Ruth.
- Jesus.

56:09.589 --> 56:10.888
That's not going to fix it.

56:10.890 --> 56:11.990
Is he staying for dinner?

56:11.992 --> 56:13.058
- Emma...
- That's fine.

56:13.060 --> 56:14.426
Yeah, I need to get going.

56:14.428 --> 56:17.028
Hey, Gerry, thank you
for your service.

56:17.030 --> 56:18.529
Thanks for the service, Gerry.

56:18.531 --> 56:19.865
[Bert] Nice going.

56:19.867 --> 56:20.868
[Nick] I feel a lot safer now.

56:21.834 --> 56:22.933
- [Bert] Who was smoking in the house?
- Emma!

56:22.935 --> 56:24.236
Was it you?

56:24.238 --> 56:26.270
No, Dad. I just
came home with you.

56:26.272 --> 56:28.540
- [Bridget] Emma.
- Somebody was smoking in the house.

56:28.542 --> 56:31.575
- Who was it? The guy?
- Emma.

56:31.577 --> 56:33.814
Or Princess Charming over there?

56:35.481 --> 56:37.184
What do I owe you?

56:39.519 --> 56:41.022
So you're not divorced.

56:42.356 --> 56:43.825
No.

56:48.528 --> 56:50.131
Five hundred, please.

56:51.265 --> 56:52.834
[scoffs]

56:54.167 --> 56:55.837
Includes materials.

56:58.238 --> 57:00.408
- It's Gerry with a G.
- Yeah.

57:02.975 --> 57:04.211
Thank you.

57:19.059 --> 57:21.062
- Chemically sensitive, huh?
- Shut up.

57:21.528 --> 57:24.428
- Let me in, I'm freezing.
- That's a nice bra, is that Ma's, too?

57:24.430 --> 57:26.131
- Let me in.
- No.

57:26.133 --> 57:28.002
They can stay?

57:28.568 --> 57:32.002
Hey! They can stay?

57:32.004 --> 57:33.540
Yeah. For now.

57:34.140 --> 57:35.506
When did you come up with that?

57:35.508 --> 57:37.341
For now. God.

57:37.343 --> 57:38.211
What?

57:39.011 --> 57:42.082
Hey! Who the hell
do you think you are, huh?

57:42.950 --> 57:44.482
Queen Bitty,
ladies and gentlemen,

57:44.484 --> 57:48.890
she comes to town, spends three
days, three fucking days,

57:49.289 --> 57:52.323
throws in a lock,
problem solved, what a genius!

57:52.325 --> 57:54.459
Oh, boy! Why didn't
I think of that?

57:54.461 --> 57:56.160
- Who do you think you are?
- [scoffs]

57:56.162 --> 57:57.562
I'm not off the plane
ten minutes

57:57.564 --> 57:59.397
and you're telling me
what I have to do

57:59.399 --> 58:00.732
before I had a chance
to evaluate the situation.

58:00.734 --> 58:02.036
Who am I? Who am I?

58:02.301 --> 58:05.203
I'm the one who's here. Okay?

58:05.205 --> 58:07.504
- I'm the one who gets the call...
- God, get out of my face.

58:07.506 --> 58:11.176
...in the middle of the night. I'm the
one with the geriatrician on speed dial

58:11.178 --> 58:14.044
The fact that you
got power of attorney

58:14.046 --> 58:19.386
is the biggest, stinkiest pile of
favoritist bullshit I ever heard.

58:19.653 --> 58:21.187
Damn it.

58:21.555 --> 58:22.990
Hey.

58:23.723 --> 58:25.158
[snickers]

58:25.691 --> 58:27.928
You don't even know
the code, that's funny.

58:28.428 --> 58:30.995
- Fuck.
- Hey, why don't we get Gerry back here?

58:30.997 --> 58:33.598
He can change the locks, and
then I'll take Emma to the mall

58:33.600 --> 58:35.136
and you two can go at it.

58:36.303 --> 58:38.336
- You know why I got power of attorney?
- Why?

58:38.338 --> 58:42.741
Because you're an asshole, that's why.
You are an asshole.

58:42.743 --> 58:44.478
[scoffs] Uh-uh.

58:45.345 --> 58:48.982
You got power of attorney
'cause you're a chicken shit.

58:49.682 --> 58:51.117
He knew you'd never use it.

58:52.285 --> 58:53.752
You been letting him tell you
what to do your whole life.

58:53.754 --> 58:55.522
- I have not.
- Oh, yeah?

58:56.455 --> 58:59.059
Let me ask you something.
Why did you marry Eddie?

59:00.794 --> 59:03.164
Because I didn't know
who I was. Okay?

59:03.763 --> 59:07.298
And Mom had her big career,
and I was the housekeeper.

59:07.300 --> 59:09.100
- Oh, my goodness.
- Who do you think

59:09.102 --> 59:12.506
got food on the table, huh?
Who ironed your...

59:13.240 --> 59:15.673
- Fenwick shirts?
- Who put a gun to your head?

59:15.675 --> 59:20.578
Somebody had to do it. Somebody had to
fucking do it Nick, and I was the girl.

59:20.580 --> 59:24.518
No, Bitty, you're not a victim, all right?
You're not a martyr.

59:24.718 --> 59:28.386
Nobody forced you to obey, okay?
You got to grow up

59:28.388 --> 59:31.192
and don't be so terrified.
Stop being a liar.

59:31.490 --> 59:33.792
- I am not a liar.
- You've been lying for so long

59:33.794 --> 59:36.326
that you don't even know the
difference between the truth,

59:36.328 --> 59:39.033
and what you want everybody
to think is the truth.

59:41.834 --> 59:43.301
Our parents live here.

59:43.303 --> 59:44.605
[Nick]
She doesn't know the code.

59:44.838 --> 59:47.404
You ought to visit them
once in a while.

59:47.406 --> 59:49.573
- Who are you, the guilt monger?
- Nicky.

59:49.575 --> 59:54.115
I know you. You're the one who
smokes so close to my rosebushes.

59:54.414 --> 59:56.548
Go sit on your rosebushes.

59:56.550 --> 59:58.316
Nicky. I'm so sorry.

59:58.318 --> 01:00:00.553
For what?
What are you sorry for?

01:00:02.089 --> 01:00:03.520
- Shut up.
- [woman] Shame on him.

01:00:03.522 --> 01:00:05.126
- [Bridget] I'm so sorry.
- It was rude.

01:00:05.691 --> 01:00:07.527
I can't believe this. So rude.

01:00:07.827 --> 01:00:09.593
At least I don't
bulldoze people.

01:00:09.595 --> 01:00:12.096
I'm not some bully telling
everyone what to do,

01:00:12.098 --> 01:00:14.432
saying, "You, you, you, let me
tell you what's wrong with you

01:00:14.434 --> 01:00:16.037
so you never see
what's wrong with me!"

01:00:16.435 --> 01:00:18.837
At least I don't blame Mom
and Dad for all my bullshit.

01:00:18.839 --> 01:00:22.874
Excuse me? Didn't you just blame them for
your entire shitty 20-year marriage?

01:00:22.876 --> 01:00:25.745
At least I had the guts to try,

01:00:26.379 --> 01:00:29.583
to try to love somebody,
to let somebody love me.

01:00:30.316 --> 01:00:31.850
At least I have something.

01:00:31.852 --> 01:00:33.750
Oh, I got plenty, honey,
believe me.

01:00:33.752 --> 01:00:35.189
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:37.091
You got a bar.

01:00:38.191 --> 01:00:40.327
Get in the house.

01:00:43.463 --> 01:00:45.332
I can hear you
all the way down the hall.

01:00:45.765 --> 01:00:47.167
Why don't you tell me the truth?

01:00:47.434 --> 01:00:49.202
Why did you give Bit
the power of attorney?

01:00:49.502 --> 01:00:52.372
Because you're a hothead
like your mother.

01:00:52.638 --> 01:00:55.742
No, no, no.
No, it's because you're selfish.

01:00:56.475 --> 01:00:58.412
You know why they get better
in memory care?

01:00:58.845 --> 01:01:01.912
Because they don't have people
in their face all the time

01:01:01.914 --> 01:01:05.149
saying, "Don't forget me,
please don't forget me,

01:01:05.151 --> 01:01:06.386
you're losing your mind."

01:01:07.453 --> 01:01:09.354
The one blessing of this disease

01:01:09.356 --> 01:01:11.189
is that they don't remember
that they don't remember.

01:01:11.191 --> 01:01:12.557
Until you go and tell them.

01:01:12.559 --> 01:01:14.292
You think you're
a doctor or something?

01:01:14.294 --> 01:01:15.926
- What the hell do you know?
- Oh, my God.

01:01:15.928 --> 01:01:17.595
You're a goddamn bartender...

01:01:17.597 --> 01:01:19.430
- I'm a bar...
- ...who almost graduated from college.

01:01:19.432 --> 01:01:22.102
- Almost.
- I'm a bar owner, Dad.

01:01:22.334 --> 01:01:26.240
- You tend the bar?
- I own the bar. I own it.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.640
- You tend it or not?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:28.642 --> 01:01:33.912
- I tend it! I tend the bar that I own.
- You're a bartender.

01:01:33.914 --> 01:01:37.348
Okay? I know it's a real bummer,

01:01:37.350 --> 01:01:38.783
I hear you loud and clear, Pop,

01:01:38.785 --> 01:01:40.785
it's a real shit deal
you have to admit that

01:01:40.787 --> 01:01:42.287
to your fucking poker players.

01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:44.354
- Watch your language.
- Watch my language?

01:01:44.356 --> 01:01:46.259
- Yes.
- All right.

01:01:46.892 --> 01:01:48.428
[imitates zipper closing]

01:01:48.827 --> 01:01:50.296
You know what?

01:01:51.497 --> 01:01:53.501
She hit on me the other night.

01:01:54.801 --> 01:01:56.437
Yeah, Mom.

01:01:57.937 --> 01:02:02.242
She hit on me. I had to sit there and
explain to her that I was her son.

01:02:02.876 --> 01:02:05.379
You should have seen
the look on her face.

01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:19.527
I'm done. They're all yours, Bit.
Godspeed.

01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:19.386
There's a man in my bed.

01:03:21.687 --> 01:03:22.689
It's Dad.

01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:26.727
I sleep with our dad?

01:03:29.361 --> 01:03:30.630
Yeah.

01:03:31.897 --> 01:03:33.267
Oh.

01:03:53.952 --> 01:03:55.722
[Bert] Stay in bed, honey.

01:03:57.089 --> 01:03:58.725
You're a turkey.

01:04:00.426 --> 01:04:03.430
Mmm. You're a turkey.

01:04:15.341 --> 01:04:16.709
[cell phone vibrates]

01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:42.669
[Eddie] <i>Hi, um, your
father just called me.</i>

01:04:43.435 --> 01:04:47.874
<i>He said you're coming home tonight?
Give me a call.</i>

01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:53.713
[indistinct audio on TV]

01:04:57.117 --> 01:04:58.718
Is that my baby?

01:05:10.729 --> 01:05:11.995
I don't want it.

01:05:11.997 --> 01:05:12.965
It's coffee.

01:05:13.533 --> 01:05:15.732
I don't want it!

01:05:15.734 --> 01:05:18.636
- Of course you want it. Have it.
- I am a grown-up!

01:05:18.638 --> 01:05:21.004
If I don't want the coffee,
I don't want the coffee!

01:05:21.006 --> 01:05:22.642
All right.

01:05:24.611 --> 01:05:25.746
What did you tell him?

01:05:26.044 --> 01:05:27.447
Who?

01:05:28.147 --> 01:05:29.749
- Nobody, sweetheart.
- It's okay, Mom.

01:05:30.582 --> 01:05:31.918
Go watch <i>Popeye,</i> honey.

01:05:33.352 --> 01:05:36.154
I told him I bought you plane tickets
and to pick you up at the airport.

01:05:36.156 --> 01:05:37.758
That's what I told him.

01:05:38.624 --> 01:05:41.060
Floozin' around with some
construction bozo.

01:05:41.593 --> 01:05:43.127
I don't even know who you are!

01:05:43.129 --> 01:05:46.533
He put locks in,
and you're welcome by the way.

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:48.902
What am I,
some kind of horse's ass?

01:05:49.968 --> 01:05:52.770
Eddie is as much a son to me
as your brother is.

01:05:52.772 --> 01:05:54.839
You know, I think you like
Eddie more than you like me,

01:05:54.841 --> 01:05:56.774
or my brother for that matter.

01:05:56.776 --> 01:05:59.780
For Chrissake, Bitty, what
kind of thing is that to say?

01:06:00.446 --> 01:06:02.782
Get dressed.
We're leaving in an hour.

01:06:18.798 --> 01:06:21.499
All my life you've been telling
me there's no bells and whistles.

01:06:21.501 --> 01:06:22.533
There's no bells and whistles.

01:06:22.535 --> 01:06:23.667
There isn't.

01:06:23.669 --> 01:06:24.937
How can you say that?

01:06:25.772 --> 01:06:28.008
You have more bells
and whistles than anybody.

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:32.646
I mean, she's losing her mind and
you still can't live without her.

01:06:33.479 --> 01:06:34.712
Didn't you want that for me?

01:06:34.714 --> 01:06:36.513
Of course I wanted that for you,

01:06:36.515 --> 01:06:37.848
that's all I want for you.

01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:39.952
Why do you think
I'm sending you home?

01:06:41.488 --> 01:06:42.252
Dad.

01:06:42.254 --> 01:06:43.523
Bit.

01:06:43.957 --> 01:06:48.095
Love is commitment,
you work at it.

01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:51.962
Go home to your husband and ask yourself
why you married him in the first place.

01:06:51.964 --> 01:06:54.232
I married him because you
told me I couldn't do better.

01:06:54.234 --> 01:06:57.069
You couldn't!
Eddie is a home run!

01:06:57.569 --> 01:06:59.636
Your wedding was
the best day of my life,

01:06:59.638 --> 01:07:03.709
walking you down the aisle to a man
who I thought might deserve you.

01:07:05.711 --> 01:07:07.544
You know what your problem is?

01:07:07.546 --> 01:07:08.481
California!

01:07:08.814 --> 01:07:11.249
That's what.
Everybody out there,

01:07:11.251 --> 01:07:15.622
flowin' in the wind, reinventing.
What the heck is that?

01:07:15.921 --> 01:07:21.191
You are who you are. I am a
father, a husband, a Catholic.

01:07:21.193 --> 01:07:24.160
I know it because I am it.
I never had to think about it.

01:07:24.162 --> 01:07:29.669
But there is no reason to be unhappy
with a perfectly good marriage.

01:07:32.671 --> 01:07:34.607
I don't have what you have.

01:07:35.073 --> 01:07:35.907
Yes, you do.

01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:39.646
Don't you think
we had rough periods?

01:07:40.914 --> 01:07:42.812
You ought to go talk
to a priest!

01:07:42.814 --> 01:07:44.517
I'm not a Catholic anymore.

01:07:45.051 --> 01:07:47.754
Well, there's your problem
right there.

01:07:48.021 --> 01:07:49.490
How do you know?

01:07:49.888 --> 01:07:53.260
How do you always know
what my problem is?

01:07:53.926 --> 01:07:56.160
Do I do that to you?
Did I march in here and say,

01:07:56.162 --> 01:07:58.631
"She's going in a home, if you don't
like it, go talk to a priest?"

01:07:59.031 --> 01:08:01.232
I listened to you, Dad.
I asked you what you wanted

01:08:01.234 --> 01:08:03.868
and I fought like hell to get it
for you because you matter to me.

01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:08.642
What you want matters to me.
Why don't I matter to you?

01:08:11.877 --> 01:08:13.877
Mom was a feminist,
for Chrissake.

01:08:13.879 --> 01:08:16.749
Why didn't anyone ever
ask me what I wanted?

01:08:18.318 --> 01:08:21.854
Honey. We did ask you
what you wanted.

01:08:22.154 --> 01:08:24.857
You said you couldn't
wait to be a mother.

01:08:28.026 --> 01:08:29.127
[knocking]

01:08:29.796 --> 01:08:30.962
Is Grandma in here?

01:08:31.196 --> 01:08:33.698
- No.
- Oh, shit.

01:08:34.232 --> 01:08:35.535
What?

01:08:39.037 --> 01:08:41.675
Oh, Goddamn it!

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.778
Damn it!

01:08:46.812 --> 01:08:48.781
[Emma] Maybe she's upstairs.
I'll go check.

01:08:49.649 --> 01:08:50.816
Ruth!

01:08:54.654 --> 01:08:55.955
Ruth!

01:09:00.392 --> 01:09:01.761
[Emma] Mom!

01:09:02.227 --> 01:09:03.162
I got her.

01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:05.598
She's at Marion's.

01:09:09.234 --> 01:09:10.136
Dad!

01:09:12.372 --> 01:09:14.106
- Dad!
- [sobs]

01:09:14.774 --> 01:09:16.840
Dad. Are you okay?

01:09:16.841 --> 01:09:18.944
Is it your heart? Dad?

01:09:32.124 --> 01:09:34.194
Come on. Come on.

01:09:38.095 --> 01:09:39.330
[groans]

01:09:39.332 --> 01:09:40.867
Okay.

01:09:49.975 --> 01:09:51.044
I'll stay.

01:09:53.145 --> 01:09:54.714
I'll stay and help.

01:10:29.082 --> 01:10:32.883
[Bridget] So, I'll come back at the end
of the month to help you get moved.

01:10:32.885 --> 01:10:35.452
[Bert] Thank you, Bitty.
You bet. We'll be fine.

01:10:35.454 --> 01:10:36.920
Am I going with you?

01:10:36.922 --> 01:10:39.859
You're coming out here
to give me a hug.

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:42.062
Ah.

01:10:43.361 --> 01:10:44.929
Where should we...

01:10:44.931 --> 01:10:47.100
Here. What's wrong?

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.903
I'm going to see you
in a couple weeks.

01:10:50.269 --> 01:10:52.004
I won't be here.

01:10:52.204 --> 01:10:54.207
Yeah? Where are you going?

01:10:56.109 --> 01:10:58.945
I expect my mother
will want me back by then.

01:10:59.979 --> 01:11:02.716
Yeah? Don't you think?

01:11:04.182 --> 01:11:06.052
[Bert] Hop in, Ruth, it's cold.

01:11:10.890 --> 01:11:12.225
Here, here's your seatbelt.

01:11:13.092 --> 01:11:16.329
My shoes don't match my purse.
[chuckles]

01:11:16.796 --> 01:11:17.897
Love you, Bit.

01:11:18.498 --> 01:11:19.833
Love you, Dad.

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:22.235
Bye, Mom.

01:11:28.775 --> 01:11:30.243
So, how was it?

01:11:33.178 --> 01:11:34.213
Fine.

01:11:36.248 --> 01:11:37.416
Hmm.

01:11:38.717 --> 01:11:42.855
And your dad's all set? He's
got all the paperwork signed?

01:11:44.156 --> 01:11:45.124
Yeah.

01:11:46.425 --> 01:11:47.994
Mom moves in the first.

01:11:48.561 --> 01:11:49.996
Good.

01:11:50.395 --> 01:11:51.864
[laughs]

01:11:52.899 --> 01:11:54.999
Nick's got to be happy,

01:11:55.001 --> 01:11:57.904
being right for the first time
in his life.

01:11:58.303 --> 01:11:59.739
Poor guy.

01:12:03.242 --> 01:12:04.410
Did you, um...

01:12:05.011 --> 01:12:07.047
You register for classes?

01:12:08.146 --> 01:12:09.315
Mm-hmm.

01:12:09.882 --> 01:12:12.352
Good. Good.

01:12:16.888 --> 01:12:19.092
[Eddie snores, faintly]

01:12:44.316 --> 01:12:46.584
- What are you doing?
- Just let me.

01:12:46.586 --> 01:12:48.053
[sighs]

01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:06.939
I'm sorry.

01:13:10.075 --> 01:13:13.212
I just look at you
and all I see is my baby.

01:13:17.216 --> 01:13:18.251
I know.

01:13:24.123 --> 01:13:26.393
You don't have to go back
if you don't want.

01:13:31.631 --> 01:13:33.266
I can't stay here, Mom.

01:13:37.637 --> 01:13:39.072
I know.

01:13:43.508 --> 01:13:46.378
- [blues music playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

01:14:11.369 --> 01:14:13.038
Do a Manhattan?

01:14:14.239 --> 01:14:15.207
Yeah.

01:15:49.068 --> 01:15:51.404
Damn good Manhattan, Nicholas.

01:16:05.217 --> 01:16:08.054
Is it, is it Christmas?

01:16:08.654 --> 01:16:10.254
You got drunk at Christmas.

01:16:10.256 --> 01:16:14.293
- I did not.
- Yes you did. Grab those presents...

01:16:15.127 --> 01:16:17.530
- and come on over.
- Oh!

01:16:18.263 --> 01:16:20.165
- Here.
- Yes.

01:16:21.266 --> 01:16:22.601
There you go.

01:16:23.302 --> 01:16:27.537
And now we, we'll have Christmas.
I'll go first?

01:16:27.539 --> 01:16:28.574
Yeah.

01:16:29.575 --> 01:16:32.311
- Uh, what could this be?
- Who gave that to you?

01:16:32.845 --> 01:16:34.446
You did, you turkey.

01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:37.716
- Yeah, all right.
- I...

01:16:38.217 --> 01:16:40.020
- There it is.
- I'll help.

01:16:40.285 --> 01:16:41.751
- I'll help, too.
- There we go.

01:16:41.753 --> 01:16:43.252
I...

01:16:43.254 --> 01:16:45.592
There we are,
you're good at that.

01:16:45.857 --> 01:16:47.691
- Look what it is!
- Oh!

01:16:47.693 --> 01:16:49.225
- Macadamias.
- You like those.

01:16:49.227 --> 01:16:52.261
- My favorite kind, too.
- Yeah.

01:16:52.263 --> 01:16:54.566
Thank you, honey.
Thank you.

01:16:57.168 --> 01:16:59.405
Okay, all right,
you're next.

01:17:01.473 --> 01:17:03.506
- Here.
- It's from you.

01:17:03.508 --> 01:17:04.577
Yes, it is.

01:17:08.646 --> 01:17:10.050
There you go.

01:17:10.716 --> 01:17:12.352
Okay, open it up.

01:17:13.252 --> 01:17:14.486
Go ahead.

01:17:16.187 --> 01:17:18.658
[gasps] Oh!

01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:23.462
Oh.

01:17:24.730 --> 01:17:27.634
And I want you
to look inside because

01:17:28.434 --> 01:17:30.102
there's something here.

01:17:33.204 --> 01:17:34.606
You know who that is?

01:17:40.678 --> 01:17:44.180
Oh, yes. It's you and me.

01:17:44.182 --> 01:17:47.753
It's you and me. So...

01:17:48.354 --> 01:17:51.356
in the new place,
when you forget,

01:17:51.690 --> 01:17:55.227
just look at it.

01:17:56.529 --> 01:17:57.564
All right?

01:18:03.369 --> 01:18:05.368
I'm so sorry, Bertie.

01:18:05.370 --> 01:18:11.308
Oh, sweet baby, don't...
don't worry about it.

01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:13.544
[both sobbing]

01:18:13.546 --> 01:18:18.318
Don't worry a bit.
Don't. I'm fine.

01:18:20.519 --> 01:18:22.122
I'm fine.

01:18:26.824 --> 01:18:28.193
Hey.

01:18:33.332 --> 01:18:34.734
Who is Gerry Hoffsteader?

01:18:36.936 --> 01:18:38.371
Who?

01:18:39.605 --> 01:18:42.839
You didn't write him
a check for 500 bucks?

01:18:42.841 --> 01:18:45.509
Oh, yes.
He's a construction guy.

01:18:45.511 --> 01:18:49.682
He did, um... he put locks
in my parents' place.

01:18:51.417 --> 01:18:54.283
What, he change every lock
in the whole building?

01:18:54.285 --> 01:18:59.626
I know. He was... It was
expensive. I'm sorry.

01:19:01.793 --> 01:19:03.695
I got you a little something.

01:19:13.739 --> 01:19:15.208
Thank you.

01:19:26.752 --> 01:19:28.488
Oh. Um...

01:19:30.588 --> 01:19:32.658
I think you got this
for me before.

01:19:33.659 --> 01:19:36.596
No, no, I... they said
that one's different.

01:19:37.329 --> 01:19:38.531
Open it.

01:20:06.859 --> 01:20:08.093
Thank you.

01:20:11.963 --> 01:20:13.830
I thought
if I upgraded the diamond,

01:20:13.832 --> 01:20:18.771
you would stop leaving it with the
pennies in the car. [chuckles]

01:20:25.511 --> 01:20:27.814
[Eddie snores faintly]

01:20:46.065 --> 01:20:48.401
[birds cawing]

01:21:01.046 --> 01:21:03.516
[sobs]

01:21:40.785 --> 01:21:43.323
[inaudible]

01:22:35.641 --> 01:22:37.510
[door creaks]

01:23:17.082 --> 01:23:19.552
[sirens wailing]

01:23:26.225 --> 01:23:27.557
[cell phone rings]

01:23:27.559 --> 01:23:28.761
Shit.

01:23:32.263 --> 01:23:33.598
Hello?

01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:38.870
Yeah.

01:23:41.138 --> 01:23:43.708
[cell phone vibrates]

01:23:50.114 --> 01:23:51.583
Nicky?

01:23:55.887 --> 01:23:56.752
Oh.

01:23:56.754 --> 01:23:59.691
[indistinct chatter]

01:24:55.113 --> 01:24:58.717
This looks like a wake.
Is this... Is this a wake?

01:25:01.052 --> 01:25:04.022
Yeah, that's what...
that's what I thought it was.

01:25:09.628 --> 01:25:12.932
And I think that maybe...
Excuse me.

01:25:19.770 --> 01:25:23.041
Hey. How we doing?

01:25:26.211 --> 01:25:27.810
Should we take her home?

01:25:27.812 --> 01:25:30.716
- Do you want to go?
- No. I...

01:25:32.985 --> 01:25:39.592
I cannot figure out, for the life
of me, whose... whose wake is it.

01:25:42.093 --> 01:25:43.828
I can't.

01:25:49.301 --> 01:25:50.703
"Norbert."

01:25:55.073 --> 01:25:56.075
[gasps]

01:26:03.382 --> 01:26:05.184
How could I have forgotten that?

01:26:22.034 --> 01:26:23.636
Oh.

01:26:24.436 --> 01:26:27.940
Pretty. What's the matter?

01:26:35.212 --> 01:26:40.719
My dad grew up on a farm
in a small town called Amboy.

01:26:41.218 --> 01:26:46.324
He met Ruth O'Shea
at an ice cream social

01:26:47.025 --> 01:26:50.363
and had a thing for her
ever since.

01:26:50.796 --> 01:26:53.699
Even though she wouldn't
give him the time of day.

01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:58.167
After high school,
he went off to Korea

01:26:58.169 --> 01:27:02.104
and when he took leave
and came home,

01:27:02.106 --> 01:27:05.942
his mom told him that poor
Ruthie O'Shea had gotten polio

01:27:05.944 --> 01:27:08.848
and hadn't been
out of bed for six months.

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:13.818
So, he marched over there
and picked her up

01:27:14.418 --> 01:27:19.057
right out of bed.
And carried her in his arms.

01:27:19.824 --> 01:27:21.760
- To the movies.
- To the movies.

01:27:22.793 --> 01:27:23.995
To the movies.

01:27:32.404 --> 01:27:33.939
[Bridget] <i>He never let her go.</i>

01:27:35.873 --> 01:27:37.776
[sobbing]

01:27:38.909 --> 01:27:40.410
[Bridget] <i>He couldn't
live without her.</i>

01:27:40.412 --> 01:27:42.748
[sobs]

01:29:11.436 --> 01:29:13.339
This was the perfect time.

01:29:15.873 --> 01:29:17.309
Any later...

01:29:18.877 --> 01:29:20.780
I'd have forgotten him.

01:29:23.214 --> 01:29:26.785
Any earlier,
I'd have missed him too much.

01:29:28.285 --> 01:29:30.189
Right now is perfect.

01:29:32.156 --> 01:29:34.894
I'll hardly ever know
the difference.

01:30:03.488 --> 01:30:05.087
You hate the car.

01:30:05.089 --> 01:30:07.226
All right. That's horseshit.
I don't hate the car.

01:30:12.596 --> 01:30:15.400
I mean, how the hell would you
even get it to California?

01:30:15.633 --> 01:30:17.235
I'm going to drive it.

01:30:17.968 --> 01:30:19.337
With Mom.

01:30:22.673 --> 01:30:25.010
- [snickers]
- What?

01:30:28.012 --> 01:30:29.247
It's my turn.

01:30:30.515 --> 01:30:32.514
I found a great place near me.

01:30:32.516 --> 01:30:35.386
It's hard, Bit. It's really,
really hard, you know?

01:30:37.422 --> 01:30:41.093
It's harder than having your
hands in raw poultry all day.

01:30:42.159 --> 01:30:45.196
I know. That's why it's my turn.

01:30:50.068 --> 01:30:52.303
Well, I hope you have AAA.

01:31:12.556 --> 01:31:16.158
[Ruth] I was a fountain girl
all my life.

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:19.364
My father would bring me
chocolate malts.

01:31:20.332 --> 01:31:21.499
Yum.

01:31:24.601 --> 01:31:26.335
I had polio.

01:31:26.337 --> 01:31:27.269
Yeah.

01:31:27.271 --> 01:31:31.443
And consequently, I got...

01:31:32.209 --> 01:31:34.346
- Fat?
- Fat! Yeah!

01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:36.915
Who lives here?

01:31:37.414 --> 01:31:38.516
You.

01:31:41.052 --> 01:31:42.288
Look at that.

01:31:47.659 --> 01:31:53.933
Who's missing? Somebody's missing.
Somebody's missing.

01:31:59.169 --> 01:32:00.471
Look at this.

01:32:05.142 --> 01:32:07.078
That's my boyfriend.

01:32:08.613 --> 01:32:12.415
He's at home. He's waiting.
He's waiting for me.

01:32:12.417 --> 01:32:16.387
- He's always hanging around. That turkey.
- [both laughing]

01:32:17.521 --> 01:32:19.091
You got a boyfriend?

01:32:20.525 --> 01:32:21.460
No.

01:32:24.529 --> 01:32:26.098
Well, he's out there.

01:32:27.399 --> 01:32:28.334
You watch out.

01:32:29.367 --> 01:32:33.571
Once he's found you,
he's never gonna let you go.

01:32:37.409 --> 01:32:40.076
- Oh, yeah.
- You follow that sign.

01:32:40.078 --> 01:32:42.377
They were pretty.
Do you see how they light up?

01:32:42.379 --> 01:32:44.246
- Yeah.
- Different looking.

01:32:44.248 --> 01:32:48.251
Where are we? Where are we going?
Where's my purse?

01:32:48.253 --> 01:32:49.588
I have your purse.

01:32:50.187 --> 01:32:51.323
I have it.

01:32:54.691 --> 01:32:57.128
[beeping]

01:32:59.064 --> 01:33:01.300
- Love you.
- Love you.

01:33:03.267 --> 01:33:05.535
Oh, is that my baby?

01:33:05.537 --> 01:33:07.172
[woman] Hi, Ms. Ruth.

01:33:11.275 --> 01:33:13.276
Do you have a boyfriend?

01:33:13.278 --> 01:33:14.713
Mine, mine, mine...

01:33:15.579 --> 01:33:18.714
Oh, look at that
little one. [chuckles]

01:33:18.716 --> 01:33:22.151
- Hi, baby.
- Waiting for the bus. It's coming.

01:33:22.153 --> 01:33:24.687
- Almost home.
- Yeah. You look great.

01:33:24.689 --> 01:33:25.790
You too.

01:33:26.824 --> 01:33:31.160
She's so nice. I used to go
to school with her.

01:33:31.162 --> 01:33:32.428
You know what?

01:33:32.430 --> 01:33:34.796
I think if your
boyfriend comes in

01:33:34.798 --> 01:33:37.099
when my boyfriend comes in,

01:33:37.101 --> 01:33:40.702
we could have fun. We could have a party.
What do you think?

01:33:40.704 --> 01:33:42.240
[woman] Hello.

01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:21.145

01:34:36.226 --> 01:34:38.497
