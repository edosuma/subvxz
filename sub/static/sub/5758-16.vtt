WEBVTT

00:00.214 --> 00:02.354
Previously on Pretty Little Liars.

00:02.355 --> 00:03.457
I'm scared.

00:03.458 --> 00:04.522
All I can think about is

00:04.523 --> 00:06.749
when the next bad thing is gonna happen.

00:06.750 --> 00:09.176
He left my apartment to go beat her.

00:09.177 --> 00:10.462
The next day she was missing.

00:10.463 --> 00:12.335
He was with my mother the entire night.

00:12.336 --> 00:13.594
Did he tell you that?

00:13.595 --> 00:15.084
You're going back to Bucks County?

00:15.085 --> 00:17.524
I am exactly where I need to be.

00:21.767 --> 00:24.595
I found these in his dresser.
Those are mine.

00:24.864 --> 00:27.240
I don't think Byron knows
we have those pages.

00:27.241 --> 00:30.316
If you want, I can take them... no.
Don't worry. I hid them.

00:30.494 --> 00:32.819
I don't want to see you, I
don't want to hear from you,

00:33.099 --> 00:34.376
and I don't want to know you.

00:43.196 --> 00:44.260
What is this?

00:45.867 --> 00:49.318
Some kind of herb thing. It's
Meredith's cure-all recipe.

00:49.715 --> 00:52.472
I don't think it's working.
You look terrible.

00:52.843 --> 00:53.784
Thank you.

00:55.133 --> 00:56.277
Oh, God...

00:57.965 --> 01:00.394
I couldn't have picked a
worse time to get sick.

01:01.158 --> 01:02.363
Have you heard from your dad?

01:04.037 --> 01:05.898
He left a message, but I
haven't talked to him

01:05.899 --> 01:07.351
since he left for his conference.

01:09.930 --> 01:11.595
Hey. How's the patient?

01:11.596 --> 01:13.133
Not great.

01:13.424 --> 01:14.321
Well...

01:14.502 --> 01:17.066
I brought over everything
that helps me when I'm sick.

01:18.033 --> 01:18.992
Trash...

01:20.824 --> 01:21.861
Ginger ale...

01:22.463 --> 01:26.003
And three seasons of "saved by the bell."

01:26.274 --> 01:27.384
Thank you, Hanna.

01:29.079 --> 01:31.070
Are you sure you want to
stay here by yourself?

01:31.078 --> 01:34.597
Guys, I'm fine. You don't look fine.

01:34.977 --> 01:36.186
So I've heard.

01:36.390 --> 01:38.529
You sure you don't want us
to drive you to your mom's?

01:38.628 --> 01:42.010
No, it's her week with Mike, so
the guest room's already taken.

01:42.011 --> 01:44.121
And besides, I promised Meredith

01:44.122 --> 01:45.828
that I wouldn't tell her about Ali's diary

01:45.829 --> 01:48.737
until we talked to my dad, so
if I just stay away from her,

01:48.738 --> 01:50.214
it's easier to keep that a secret.

01:50.598 --> 01:52.549
I can't believe we're trusting Meredith.

01:52.555 --> 01:55.874
I think she's really just
as devastated as I am.

01:56.098 --> 01:57.843
You're not giving her the pages, right?

01:57.844 --> 02:00.045
No, they're hidden in a safe place,

02:00.046 --> 02:02.226
and they'll stay there
till my dad get home.

02:03.866 --> 02:06.026
Then we'll give him the
chance to tell us the truth.

02:06.383 --> 02:07.528
And if he doesn't?

02:09.640 --> 02:12.040
I don't want to believe that
my dad could have hurt Ali.

02:14.257 --> 02:15.804
But if he did do it...

02:17.655 --> 02:20.295
This is a family secret that I can't keep.

02:45.959 --> 02:47.141
We're set for tomorrow.

02:48.539 --> 02:51.250
It's too soon. Did Spencer
say something to you?

02:51.484 --> 02:53.242
She's still lying to me...

02:53.661 --> 02:56.507
pretending "a" went away when
they took you to Radley.

02:57.833 --> 02:59.754
That bitch can keep a secret.

03:01.256 --> 03:02.416
I respect that.

03:07.747 --> 03:09.647
I still feel like we're rushing this.

03:10.960 --> 03:14.495
I told you... I'm not the
one calling the shots.

03:17.126 --> 03:18.843
Fear cuts deeper than a sword.

03:23.179 --> 03:25.429
They need to understand
that she's in charge.

03:26.861 --> 03:28.409
Well, then, I'll take care of it.

03:46.330 --> 03:51.230

04:06.083 --> 04:08.099
Today's drip. Black.

04:10.631 --> 04:13.415
Thanks, em. Thank you for letting me hang.

04:15.898 --> 04:19.510
Mmm . How'd they get you to
open up the brew this morning?

04:20.152 --> 04:23.523
Kinda got drafted. I'm running
over to Spencer's for a shower.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.748
The plumber won't be here until nine.
Great.

04:26.221 --> 04:27.605
I've got some reading to do.

04:28.316 --> 04:30.746
"Lord of the flies." Your pick or theirs?

04:30.747 --> 04:32.411
Theirs. I don't mind.

04:32.784 --> 04:34.509
I kind of identify with those boys.

04:34.990 --> 04:36.956
Feel like I've been on that island.
With the girls.

04:37.854 --> 04:40.416
We did it the right way... we
stuck together no matter what.

04:40.885 --> 04:42.299
You are thick as thieves.

04:43.011 --> 04:44.928
We knew "a" was trying to tear us apart.

04:45.496 --> 04:47.392
Mona actually brought us closer together.

04:48.182 --> 04:50.896
And we know that now.
We're stronger for it.

04:51.064 --> 04:53.763
So you actually have
something to thank her for.

04:54.366 --> 04:55.663
I wouldn't go that far.

04:56.108 --> 04:58.255
Now that she back in rosewood,

04:58.593 --> 05:00.550
Mona's leaving you alone, right?

05:00.699 --> 05:03.105
She... Seems to be a model citizen.

05:03.704 --> 05:06.049
You'd tell me if things started up again...

05:06.880 --> 05:07.953
Wouldn't you?

05:08.162 --> 05:09.475
Of course.

05:12.625 --> 05:13.981
I gotta get back to the flies.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.888
Oh, hey, em, could you
lock up on your way out?

05:22.291 --> 05:23.319
Sure.

05:37.146 --> 05:39.604
Hey, Spence. Mission accomplished.

05:39.908 --> 05:42.133
He's on his way to your
house, and I got the keys.

05:43.797 --> 05:44.746
Okay...

05:45.496 --> 05:47.485
Which one screams "young and hot"

05:47.486 --> 05:49.277
without being too trendy?

05:50.228 --> 05:51.385
You're asking me?

05:52.422 --> 05:54.474
Hanna, I've had this
hoodie since I was twelve.

05:54.475 --> 05:57.369
Caleb, come on, this is important.
I have to impress Corin.

05:58.037 --> 06:00.701
It's a job interview. You're
not walking the runway.

06:00.896 --> 06:02.848
She's the hottest designer in Philly.

06:02.849 --> 06:04.751
It'd be a privilege to
get her a cup of coffee.

06:04.859 --> 06:06.513
She wants you to do it in five-inch heels?

06:06.514 --> 06:07.768
Yeah, at least.

06:11.096 --> 06:12.577
All right, go with the dress.

06:13.292 --> 06:17.012
But just to be sure, you should
probably try it on for me.

06:18.122 --> 06:19.175
I'll be right back.

06:26.597 --> 06:28.926
Hey. Ohh. Forgot my shoes.

06:29.461 --> 06:31.082
Yeah, I thought a lot about it.

06:31.764 --> 06:32.782
I'm in.

06:33.710 --> 06:35.532
I'm not gonna let her do
anything else to Hanna.

06:37.858 --> 06:39.045
We'll talk this afternoon.

06:40.526 --> 06:41.707
Who were you talking to?

06:42.582 --> 06:44.192
Um, it was my mom.

06:44.784 --> 06:46.791
It's four-thirty in California.

06:47.019 --> 06:48.591
Do you always call her this early?

06:48.727 --> 06:51.383
She's not in Montecito. She's, um...

06:51.958 --> 06:54.815
In Chicago, uh, for business.

06:55.432 --> 06:58.264
So why were you talking to
your mom about Mona and me?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.442
She knows that Mona bullied you,

07:00.443 --> 07:03.523
and she's just worried about
her being back in school.

07:04.178 --> 07:06.703
Mona had someone run your mom off the road.

07:06.855 --> 07:08.809
You shouldn't be talking
about her to anyone.

07:09.063 --> 07:11.850
Hanna, Mona tried to run you
over when you were friends.

07:12.490 --> 07:14.744
God only knows what she's gonna
do now that you've dumped her.

07:14.921 --> 07:16.225
Maybe she won't do anything.

07:16.802 --> 07:18.176
Of course she will. She's "a."

07:18.910 --> 07:20.677
We need to stay one step ahead of her.

07:20.836 --> 07:23.903
Look, just promise me that you
won't do anything stupid.

07:24.315 --> 07:26.160
Hanna... promise me.

07:28.939 --> 07:30.704
Fine. I won't do anything stupid.

07:32.370 --> 07:34.600
Now let's see something
hot and not-too-trendy.

07:51.899 --> 07:53.988
I promise today is the last time

07:54.670 --> 07:56.974
that they'll have to shut
the water off in the loft.

07:57.632 --> 07:59.847
I already told you, I don't
really have a problem with it.

08:00.049 --> 08:01.852
You sure you can't come over later and...

08:02.651 --> 08:04.330
Check out the new tub?

08:06.442 --> 08:08.676
I hate that I can't see you tonight.

08:09.261 --> 08:11.570
But they're honoring my dad at this dinner,

08:11.571 --> 08:14.077
so of course I have to be there.

08:14.641 --> 08:16.090
I understand.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.337
We will celebrate tomorrow. Yeah.

08:21.223 --> 08:22.154
Toby.

08:24.906 --> 08:25.915
Ahh.

08:26.527 --> 08:28.413
You know that I could fix this, right?

08:28.620 --> 08:31.000
Three years ago I made an exact replica

08:31.001 --> 08:33.214
of Mary queen of scots' execution dress

08:33.215 --> 08:34.604
for my Halloween costume,

08:34.881 --> 08:36.371
and I didn't have a pattern.

08:37.368 --> 08:39.046
Is there anything that you can't do?

08:39.799 --> 08:42.403
Yes. Get out of this stupid dinner

08:42.404 --> 08:44.794
that's keeping me from
you on our anniversary.

08:47.443 --> 08:51.533
Uh... I was just about to go in
the other room and get dressed.

08:51.784 --> 08:53.801
I thought I'd help you decide
on what to wear to the dinner

08:53.802 --> 08:55.759
that you're so obviously agog about.

08:56.063 --> 08:58.348
Are you sure that dad'll
be upset if I don't go?

08:58.837 --> 08:59.864
Well, he has to sit through it,

08:59.865 --> 09:02.042
so he wants his family
to sit through it, too.

09:02.366 --> 09:03.901
Misery loves company.

09:04.163 --> 09:06.197
I'll... I'll find my way out.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.329
Toby.

09:09.999 --> 09:11.359
You forgot your shirt.

09:13.263 --> 09:14.254
Bye.

09:19.332 --> 09:22.392
How'd I do? Awesome. He has no clue.

09:22.714 --> 09:23.883
I copied grandma's recipe.

09:23.884 --> 09:25.093
Oh, thank you.

09:25.872 --> 09:28.034
Ohh. What?

09:28.669 --> 09:31.744
I made that lasagna for your
father on our first anniversary.

09:33.017 --> 09:35.513
Toby's gonna love it. Thank you.

09:35.886 --> 09:37.802
And thank you for my cover story.

09:38.778 --> 09:40.213
I hope he likes surprises.

09:40.563 --> 09:41.797
I'm counting on it.

10:01.868 --> 10:02.793
Hey.

10:04.545 --> 10:05.697
How are you feeling?

10:06.135 --> 10:07.452
Not that great.

10:10.664 --> 10:12.241
Have I been sleeping all day?

10:12.739 --> 10:14.501
No, it's not quite lunchtime.

10:14.595 --> 10:17.252
I had a break in classes, so I
thought I'd check in on you.

10:19.834 --> 10:21.471
You feel really warm.

10:22.362 --> 10:24.152
I think I need to see a doctor.

10:24.466 --> 10:25.848
I was gonna call my mom...

10:31.380 --> 10:33.026
my phone was just right here.

10:33.626 --> 10:34.911
I'll look for it.

10:37.113 --> 10:38.689
But we need to get you upstairs.

10:39.212 --> 10:40.907
You'll sleep so much better in bed.

10:42.301 --> 10:43.900
Can you just have my mom call me?

10:44.289 --> 10:46.979
Yeah. I'll find her as soon
as I get back to the school.

10:48.056 --> 10:49.612
I'm sure she'll come over right away.

10:50.546 --> 10:51.664
Thank you.

10:51.688 --> 10:53.266
I bet the stress of your dad

10:53.267 --> 10:55.503
and those diary pages brought this on.

10:55.747 --> 10:57.920
I can't even think about that right now.

10:58.333 --> 10:59.607
No, of course not.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.820
But you put those pages
in a safe place, right?

11:07.939 --> 11:08.921
Aria?

11:15.781 --> 11:18.254
Rosemary chicken? Kale salad?

11:18.378 --> 11:19.859
What did I do to deserve this?

11:20.205 --> 11:21.806
I thought since you
weren't up for going out,

11:21.807 --> 11:23.456
I'd bring all your favorites to you.

11:25.657 --> 11:28.095
So, have you given any thought
to what I said the other night?

11:28.096 --> 11:29.083
About what?

11:29.721 --> 11:32.880
About seeing someone to
help you with the anxiety.

11:33.339 --> 11:36.402
Actually, I did. I found someone.

11:37.203 --> 11:39.242
And I made an appointment
for this afternoon.

11:40.115 --> 11:42.015
Really? I figured talking to someone

11:42.016 --> 11:44.187
who understands what I'm
going through can only help.

11:45.123 --> 11:46.246
Thanks for the push.

11:46.736 --> 11:47.736
Of course.

11:50.808 --> 11:52.647
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

11:52.648 --> 11:55.421
Uh, I have to borrow Emily
for some girl talk.

11:56.277 --> 12:00.283
Not girl-on-girl talk, just... Girl talk.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.987
Um, right now?

12:02.149 --> 12:03.837
I'm really sorry. It's just important.

12:04.063 --> 12:05.718
She's all yours. Okay.

12:11.615 --> 12:13.674
What's up? I called you a couple times.

12:13.675 --> 12:14.984
Yeah. I been busy.

12:16.789 --> 12:18.705
I need a favor from you, and I
normally wouldn't ask this,

12:18.706 --> 12:20.399
but I have an interview today,

12:20.400 --> 12:21.878
Aria's sick, and Spencer
is surprising Toby...

12:21.879 --> 12:24.407
okay, slow down. I need you to follow Caleb

12:24.408 --> 12:25.930
after school and see where he's going.

12:26.158 --> 12:27.572
Follow him. Why?

12:27.919 --> 12:29.434
I heard him on the phone this morning,

12:29.531 --> 12:32.343
and he's meeting someone.
They were talking about Mona.

12:32.617 --> 12:34.067
I think he's gonna shut her down.

12:34.073 --> 12:36.991
Okay. I love you, Hanna,
but I'm not in the C.I.A.

12:37.304 --> 12:39.322
I don't know the first thing
about tailing someone.

12:39.323 --> 12:42.223
It's easy. You just stay far
enough away so he doesn't see you,

12:42.224 --> 12:43.728
but not so far that you lose him.

12:43.729 --> 12:45.502
What if he does see me? You lie.

12:45.804 --> 12:47.584
You just say that you
happened to be in the area.

12:48.477 --> 12:49.701
How do you know this?

12:49.745 --> 12:52.194
My mom used to take me with her
when we were following my dad.

12:52.951 --> 12:55.343
When she thought that he was
hooking up with Isabel.

12:55.344 --> 12:56.788
He was hooking up with Isabel.

12:57.097 --> 12:58.655
Yeah. My point exactly.

12:59.272 --> 13:01.909
Look, if the roles were reversed
and Paige was in danger,

13:02.114 --> 13:03.577
you know I'd do it for you.

13:12.494 --> 13:14.404
Ella. I was just coming to see you.

13:14.777 --> 13:16.809
Ah. Here I am.

13:17.023 --> 13:19.348
I stopped by to see Aria on my break.

13:19.430 --> 13:22.486
I thought you'd want to know
she's feeling a lot better.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.376
Oh. That's great.

13:25.327 --> 13:27.784
I didn't want to call and
wake her if she was sleeping,

13:27.785 --> 13:29.330
but I'll give her a call now.

13:30.070 --> 13:32.340
Um, thanks for letting me know.

13:32.417 --> 13:33.473
Of course.

13:33.927 --> 13:36.989
And, uh, thanks for checking on her.

13:36.990 --> 13:39.542
My pleasure. Really. She's a lovely girl.

15:58.187 --> 15:58.969
Corin?

16:01.092 --> 16:02.176
Hello?

16:05.269 --> 16:08.787
Hello? It's Hanna marin.

16:09.472 --> 16:10.723
Hello?

16:24.309 --> 16:25.219
Oh, my God.

16:28.639 --> 16:29.600
Help!

16:30.690 --> 16:32.039
Somebody help me!

16:34.722 --> 16:35.333
Uhh!

16:37.140 --> 16:38.303
Come on.

18:34.927 --> 18:37.810
Thanks for meeting me. I'm
sorry you had to lie to Hanna.

18:38.628 --> 18:39.967
Some lies are worth the risk.

18:40.247 --> 18:42.195
It took me and Emily so
long to get to a place

18:42.196 --> 18:43.466
where we could trust each other.

18:43.736 --> 18:46.225
If she knew we were doing
this... same with Hanna.

18:46.739 --> 18:48.110
She would find a way to stop us.

18:50.536 --> 18:52.497
I've been running scared
since the lighthouse,

18:52.498 --> 18:54.105
getting more afraid every day.

18:54.974 --> 18:56.514
Then the other night I realized

18:57.103 --> 19:00.339
I'm not afraid for me...
I'm afraid for Emily.

19:01.394 --> 19:02.911
She's been dealing with this for so long

19:02.912 --> 19:05.496
it's almost like she's numb
to how dangerous it is.

19:06.051 --> 19:06.786
Yeah.

19:09.754 --> 19:12.054
We know that Mona has people
watching their every move.

19:12.620 --> 19:13.889
But there's no way that's she has someone

19:13.890 --> 19:15.710
watching all of us all the time.

19:17.202 --> 19:19.130
So while the girls are
playing sitting duck,

19:19.381 --> 19:21.074
I'm ready to circle the pond and...

19:21.075 --> 19:22.827
nail her psychotic butt to the wall.

19:23.702 --> 19:25.622
Yeah, something like that.

19:26.935 --> 19:28.661
Before she went to Radley, Mona had, like,

19:28.662 --> 19:30.317
all the girls' secrets locked

19:30.318 --> 19:32.600
away in a motel room...
they were her trophies.

19:32.601 --> 19:34.005
Her prized possessions.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.183
That's what she used to keep the
girls from going to the cops.

19:37.184 --> 19:40.429
So if we find her trophy room,
we can put an end to this.

19:46.970 --> 19:49.735
Corin moved her store to
society hill a month ago.

19:50.875 --> 19:53.709
Did you tell Mona you applied
for a job there? No,

19:53.710 --> 19:55.266
I applied months ago online.

19:55.544 --> 19:57.866
She's just doing this to get
back at me for cutting her off.

19:57.867 --> 20:00.392
No, it wasn't her. I saw
her at school around four.

20:01.622 --> 20:02.799
Then it was her Minion.

20:08.094 --> 20:09.982
Is she threatening to cut your face off?

20:09.983 --> 20:11.238
Or throw acid at her.

20:11.826 --> 20:12.853
You guys, come on.

20:13.903 --> 20:15.390
Shall we give this key to the cops?

20:15.703 --> 20:17.930
There's a numerical code on it.
Maybe they could trace it.

20:17.931 --> 20:19.192
Even if they could trace it,

20:19.193 --> 20:21.269
are you ready to talk about Mona 2.0?

20:21.541 --> 20:23.321
That's what we would have
to do if we turned it in.

20:23.561 --> 20:25.692
For all we know, it's not
just Mona and her Minion.

20:26.313 --> 20:28.368
Maybe she's built this whole "a" army.

20:28.986 --> 20:30.611
We still don't know what her endgame is.

20:30.612 --> 20:33.983
I do. It's to cut my face off.
I hear you guys,

20:33.984 --> 20:36.753
but she still has all those
pictures of us at Ali's grave.

20:37.031 --> 20:40.046
You know what? I don't care anymore.
She has to be stopped.

20:41.406 --> 20:44.744
You're right. But this decision
is going to affect all of us.

20:45.013 --> 20:47.955
Aria has to be in on it too. Has
anyone talked to her today?

20:47.956 --> 20:50.131
I tried her phone, but
all I get is voicemail.

20:50.618 --> 20:52.755
Me too. She's probably still sleeping.

20:53.230 --> 20:55.041
Let's just wait. We'll talk
about it in the morning.

20:59.381 --> 21:00.733
I gotta get ready for tonight.

21:02.399 --> 21:04.854
Spence, have fun tonight.

21:05.589 --> 21:08.331
We'll worry about all this tomorrow.
Thanks.

21:08.332 --> 21:10.232
If you really want to surprise Toby,

21:10.554 --> 21:12.295
have on five-inch heels and

21:12.296 --> 21:13.821
nothing else when he
walks through the door.

21:15.263 --> 21:18.039
What? I've heard guys like that.

21:18.615 --> 21:19.598
Thanks for the tip.

22:16.755 --> 22:17.933
Hey, what are you doing?

22:24.094 --> 22:25.521
I'm taking back what's mine.

22:25.778 --> 22:26.832
Is this a dream?

22:28.577 --> 22:29.596
No, sweetie,

22:30.819 --> 22:32.411
I'm more real than I've ever been.

22:35.267 --> 22:38.427
Tell me what it's like. Tell me everything.

22:38.428 --> 22:39.563
Well...

22:40.897 --> 22:42.746
I don't know who said knowledge was king...

22:43.372 --> 22:44.752
just an old fart, probably...

22:45.793 --> 22:48.560
but he was right. I see everything now.

22:49.721 --> 22:51.423
I missed so much when I was here.

22:52.206 --> 22:53.517
Do you see "a"?

22:54.156 --> 22:55.265
Everywhere I turn.

22:55.937 --> 22:57.100
So do you.

22:58.264 --> 22:59.526
You all do.

23:00.195 --> 23:02.295
I'm surprised Spencer
hasn't figured that out.

23:07.940 --> 23:10.574
Did it really happen, what
you wrote in those pages?

23:11.208 --> 23:12.836
Were you blackmailing my dad?

23:14.549 --> 23:16.374
Byron's really coming around, isn't he?

23:17.244 --> 23:20.333
I mean, when the chips were
down with Ezra's mom. Ali...

23:21.504 --> 23:22.819
I need to know the truth.

23:24.073 --> 23:26.522
If I tell you the truth, you
don't have to believe it.

23:27.296 --> 23:28.241
Please.

23:30.134 --> 23:31.828
I was desperate for that money.

23:34.201 --> 23:36.216
How could you do that to my family?

23:36.801 --> 23:38.013
To me?

23:38.964 --> 23:40.357
It was just a threat.

23:41.430 --> 23:42.958
I never called your mom.

23:45.529 --> 23:46.844
Did my dad kill you?

23:48.965 --> 23:50.465
Do I look dead to you?

23:56.737 --> 23:58.042
I wouldn't drink that.

23:59.375 --> 24:00.298
What do you mean?

24:01.519 --> 24:03.818
Meredith is looking for these pages too.

24:07.933 --> 24:09.025
Ali, wait.

24:11.974 --> 24:13.582
You know why I picked you, right?

25:02.684 --> 25:03.412
What the...

25:05.979 --> 25:06.860
hello!

25:20.340 --> 25:22.809
Feed scalp. Feed beauty. Still hurts?

25:23.316 --> 25:24.947
Kyle Bown, on the boys' swim team,.

25:24.948 --> 25:26.829
He can bend his wrist
all the way to his arm,

25:26.830 --> 25:29.366
and it doesn't even hurt him.
I think he's double-jointed.

25:29.367 --> 25:31.033
And you're telling me this because?

25:31.302 --> 25:32.399
What do you mean you can't refill it?

25:32.400 --> 25:34.772
You refilled this prescription last week.

25:35.043 --> 25:37.368
Yeah, I know, but I...
misplaced my pill bottle.

25:37.642 --> 25:40.899
I'm sorry, ma'am. Clonazepam
is a class 3 medication.

25:40.900 --> 25:43.575
You can ask your doctor to
call in another prescription.

25:43.576 --> 25:46.960
I don't have time to call my doctor.
I need those pills now.

25:46.961 --> 25:48.677
There's nothing we can do for you tonight.

25:48.678 --> 25:50.262
We're closing in a few minutes.

25:51.062 --> 25:53.768
Great. That's just great.

26:02.493 --> 26:03.305
Ring me up.

26:24.258 --> 26:27.182
It says clonazepam is most
commonly used for anxiety,

26:27.183 --> 26:29.420
but some people also use
it to help them sleep.

26:29.923 --> 26:31.953
Either Meredith is a major insomniac

26:31.954 --> 26:33.571
or she's trying to knock out a cow.

26:43.584 --> 26:46.425
I do not like the idea of that
woman nursing Aria back to health.

26:46.426 --> 26:47.552
I'm calling her again.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.270
Straight to voicemail.

27:41.032 --> 27:42.190
You scared me.

27:42.463 --> 27:44.289
I'm sorry. I wanted to surprise you.

27:44.290 --> 27:46.751
You did. Why aren't you at work?

27:46.752 --> 27:49.496
I'm on a break, and since I'm
not gonna see you tonight...

27:50.710 --> 27:52.074
Happy anniversary.

27:52.359 --> 27:55.438
Oh... they're beautiful.

27:56.708 --> 27:57.994
Thank you.

27:58.831 --> 28:01.305
I feel so bad, though. I
didn't get you anything.

28:01.306 --> 28:02.798
It's okay, I didn't expect you to.

28:03.332 --> 28:04.756
Let me go put these in water.

28:18.408 --> 28:19.239
"A"?

28:20.081 --> 28:21.457
Oh. It's not what you think.

28:21.863 --> 28:25.347
Melissa left it here. She has
a storage unit in Philly.

28:32.973 --> 28:34.032
They're so pretty.

28:35.408 --> 28:36.625
I better get back to work.

28:36.761 --> 28:39.180
Yeah. I better go get
dressed for that dinner.

28:40.040 --> 28:41.672
The sky's looking pretty dark.

28:42.281 --> 28:43.721
Maybe I'll get to come home early.

28:44.041 --> 28:45.445
Will you call me if you do?

28:50.324 --> 28:51.058
Love you.

28:51.291 --> 28:52.504
I love you too.

29:14.329 --> 29:15.822
Is this what you're looking for?

29:18.198 --> 29:19.607
Quite the clever girl.

29:20.065 --> 29:23.025
I've searched every inch
of this house, twice,

29:23.162 --> 29:25.075
and I can't find those pages anywhere.

29:25.568 --> 29:26.874
Have you been drugging me?

29:26.875 --> 29:28.268
Don't be so dramatic.

29:28.528 --> 29:30.424
I gave you something to help you sleep.

29:30.425 --> 29:32.128
Yeah, and you locked me in my room.

29:32.129 --> 29:32.839
There's no way I'm letting

29:32.840 --> 29:34.553
you turn those pages over to the police.

29:34.554 --> 29:36.284
It's not really your decision, is it?

29:36.454 --> 29:37.997
Shut up and sit down!

29:46.263 --> 29:49.159
I lied to you. My friends
know about that diary.

29:49.160 --> 29:51.320
So whatever it is that you're
thinking, it's not gonna work.

30:04.195 --> 30:05.119
What?!

30:05.262 --> 30:06.283
Come on.

30:34.083 --> 30:35.290
She has to be here.

30:35.291 --> 30:36.465
Aria!

30:37.723 --> 30:39.339
Aria, are you in here?

30:47.768 --> 30:50.454
Hey. I just wanted to check in on you.

30:50.656 --> 30:54.388
I think I'm gonna make it home
before the storm really hits.

30:54.389 --> 30:56.435
Well, good. I'm glad you're on your way.

30:56.595 --> 30:58.073
So how's the dinner?

30:58.260 --> 31:00.386
Ah, it's moving along.

31:00.616 --> 31:03.150
Will you be careful? Will do.

31:03.646 --> 31:04.860
Okay, bye.

31:09.892 --> 31:10.882
Here's the key.

31:20.722 --> 31:21.836
Aria?

31:30.411 --> 31:31.235
Come on.

31:39.005 --> 31:40.138
Aria?

31:59.401 --> 32:00.623
She's not here.

32:01.950 --> 32:03.247
I'm calling her.

32:11.031 --> 32:13.877
Meredith? What are you girls
doing out in this storm?

32:13.946 --> 32:15.761
Where is Aria? She went down

32:15.762 --> 32:18.225
to the basement to look
for some flashlights.

32:18.264 --> 32:19.550
She has been down there a little while.

32:19.551 --> 32:21.157
Maybe we should check on her.

32:48.622 --> 32:51.500
Aria? Are you down here?

32:57.437 --> 32:59.035
Oh, my God, it's locked.

32:59.709 --> 33:00.720
Locked!

33:00.878 --> 33:02.017
Hang on.

33:02.616 --> 33:03.693
Okay.

33:07.701 --> 33:09.539
Hanna. What?

33:11.809 --> 33:13.599
I don't think we're alone down here.

33:26.921 --> 33:28.092
Oh, my God!

33:29.787 --> 33:31.905
Aria? Aria, are you okay?

33:32.145 --> 33:34.063
Wake up, wake up. Aria!

33:37.887 --> 33:38.988
Wake up!

33:42.399 --> 33:43.227
Aria.

33:45.257 --> 33:46.149
It's gonna be okay, Aria.

33:46.150 --> 33:50.555
No, it's not. She lost it. She's crazy.

33:56.355 --> 33:57.990
What is she doing up there?

33:57.991 --> 33:59.834
If Spencer was here she'd
say that she was pacing

33:59.835 --> 34:02.135
while she plots her way to get rid of us.

34:02.136 --> 34:03.632
She'd probably be right.

34:03.993 --> 34:06.605
There's three of us and one of her.

34:06.606 --> 34:07.415
Let's give her the pages

34:07.416 --> 34:09.025
and then we'll take her down.
Take her down?

34:09.025 --> 34:12.440
I have no problem opening a can
of whoop-ass on that woman.

34:18.395 --> 34:19.543
It's your dad.

34:20.089 --> 34:22.503
He... he wasn't supposed to
be home till tomorrow.

34:22.643 --> 34:24.304
She must have called him.

34:24.594 --> 34:26.063
Is he in on this?

34:27.219 --> 34:29.072
I don't know what I believe anymore.

34:33.181 --> 34:34.310
Meredith?

34:36.101 --> 34:37.819
Hey, I only heard half your message.

34:37.820 --> 34:39.850
I've been trying to call,
but the phones are out.

34:42.264 --> 34:44.630
Meredith? What... what's wrong?

34:45.174 --> 34:46.684
Aria knows everything.

34:47.478 --> 34:49.484
She knows about the blackmail.

34:49.841 --> 34:52.791
And she knows that you saw
Alison that night. That you...

34:57.397 --> 34:58.914
she has proof, Byron.

35:00.713 --> 35:02.198
And her friends know, too.

35:07.210 --> 35:08.873
What are you doing with that?

35:08.874 --> 35:10.174
We don't know what they're planning.

35:10.175 --> 35:11.705
My dad would never hurt us.

35:11.706 --> 35:13.928
Aria? Are you sure about that?

35:21.776 --> 35:22.630
Aria?

35:34.247 --> 35:35.483
Are you okay?

35:42.204 --> 35:44.147
You don't need to be afraid of me.

35:44.898 --> 35:47.249
I swear. I...

35:47.250 --> 35:49.288
you don't need I didn't hurt Alison.

35:50.336 --> 35:51.568
I didn't bring any money.

35:51.569 --> 35:53.701
Then we both know how this is gonna end.

35:53.702 --> 35:56.684
You know how much it'll hurt
Aria if you make that call.

35:57.314 --> 36:00.047
And I don't think you're
that horrible of a person.

36:00.173 --> 36:02.539
Then you clearly don't know me that well.

36:07.141 --> 36:08.851
Last chance to save yourself.

36:13.041 --> 36:14.111
Yes, it is.

36:18.588 --> 36:21.130
You made your bed, Mr. Montgomery!

36:29.564 --> 36:32.451
What do I have to do, call
911 to get your attention?

36:42.779 --> 36:45.882
I was prepared to tell your mom the truth.

36:46.222 --> 36:47.979
Then Alison went missing.

36:48.572 --> 36:50.858
And the longer she stayed missing,

36:52.009 --> 36:54.495
the harder it became for me to tell anyone.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.323
Is this what you're looking for?

38:17.350 --> 38:18.537
Spencer.

38:22.528 --> 38:23.916
How long have you known?

38:37.824 --> 38:38.790
Spencer?

38:43.370 --> 38:44.334
Hi, honey.

38:45.850 --> 38:47.112
Is everything okay?

38:49.397 --> 38:50.638
What is it, honey?

38:50.639 --> 38:51.749
Mommy!

39:07.515 --> 39:11.987
I-I called the police, and they
checked Meredith's apartment.

39:11.988 --> 39:13.264
She's gone.

39:14.182 --> 39:17.749
You told us about the affair. Why
didn't you tell us about this?

39:23.922 --> 39:25.565
When they found Alison's body,

39:25.566 --> 39:27.852
it was clear that she had been murdered,

39:27.881 --> 39:29.864
and there were no suspects.

39:30.654 --> 39:33.669
I saw her the night she died,
and I knew how that would look.

39:33.670 --> 39:35.420
You mean how it does look.

39:38.414 --> 39:41.229
What started this? How did you find out?

39:44.511 --> 39:46.741
We found an old diary of Ali's.

39:47.250 --> 39:48.752
She wrote about you.

40:02.813 --> 40:05.119
Why didn't... why didn't
you come and talk to me?

40:05.120 --> 40:06.608
I wanted to.

40:07.282 --> 40:09.656
But Meredith made me believe
that you actually...

40:14.214 --> 40:15.628
I was scared.

40:16.183 --> 40:19.577
Aria, I need to know if
there's any part of you

40:19.578 --> 40:22.080
that still thinks that I
could have done this.

40:31.081 --> 40:32.213
I understand.

40:36.061 --> 40:37.009
Where are you going?

40:37.010 --> 40:39.457
I'm gonna do something I should
have done a long time ago.

40:39.458 --> 40:41.664
I'm gonna tell the police everything.

40:42.310 --> 40:44.717
And hopefully after whatever
investigation they do

40:44.718 --> 40:48.677
you will realize that I had nothing
to do with Alison's death.

41:00.317 --> 41:01.488
What are you doing?

41:04.136 --> 41:05.430
I believe you.

41:43.050 --> 41:44.551
I know you're in there.

42:11.828 --> 42:12.635
Will you...

42:13.183 --> 42:16.294
Will you just tell me that what
I saw tonight wasn't real?

42:21.910 --> 42:23.276
Please!

42:24.086 --> 42:26.524
Just tell me that there's
more to this story...

42:28.210 --> 42:30.400
That there's something that I don't know.

42:34.252 --> 42:37.010
Please. Please, Toby...

42:39.034 --> 42:40.968
Please, Toby.
