<i>...Possibility of light rain.</i>

00:14.681 --> 00:17.976
<i>The 14-day trend sunshine and
seasonal temperatures...</i>

00:18.060 --> 00:19.394
Yes.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.206
<i>And now here's Ed with the latest</i>

00:21.230 --> 00:22.606
<i>on Tropical Storm Cecil.</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:24.524
<i>Well, rain and moderate winds are expected</i>

00:24.608 --> 00:27.319
with the latest readings showing
the tropical storm Cecil

00:27.402 --> 00:30.405
dissipating long before it
reaches the Pacific coast.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.031
But that will change.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.784
Yes, it will be altered.

00:33.867 --> 00:34.867
Re-set.

00:44.920 --> 00:45.837
<i>Megabyte.</i>

00:45.921 --> 00:48.257
Yes, I am right here.

00:48.632 --> 00:51.843
What destructive endeavors
on the agenda today?

00:51.927 --> 00:54.513
Removing a cyberpatch, perhaps?

00:54.763 --> 00:56.515
Releasing a virus?

00:56.598 --> 00:58.559
Crushing a bank site?

00:58.809 --> 01:00.269
<i>There is a special satellite.</i>

01:00.352 --> 01:02.938
<i>A military weather satellite.</i>

01:03.021 --> 01:04.982
<i>I want access to its computer.</i>

01:05.357 --> 01:07.025
<i>But the system will be guarded.</i>

01:07.109 --> 01:08.402
<i>Protected.</i>

01:08.694 --> 01:12.531
My sentinel army will remove
any unwanted obstacles.

01:12.614 --> 01:13.865
<i>Yes.</i>

01:13.949 --> 01:15.701
<i>Clear the path. Give me access.</i>

01:15.784 --> 01:17.411
Direct access.

01:17.953 --> 01:22.082
And if the guardian pests
attempt to thwart the plan?

01:23.125 --> 01:25.377
<i>For your sake, make sure they don't.</i>

01:26.128 --> 01:27.296
Now go.

01:27.379 --> 01:28.672
Get started.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.800
The storm is brewing.

01:36.305 --> 01:38.890
You know it's not actually
raining, right, Vera?

01:38.974 --> 01:41.184
I prefer to be prepared in
the event of precipitation.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.729
The forecast indicates a...

01:44.313 --> 01:45.665
seventy-five percent probability of rain

01:45.689 --> 01:47.166
due to the tropical storm Cecil developing

01:47.190 --> 01:48.900
over the Pacific ocean.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.819
This weather update brought
to you by Vera!

01:50.902 --> 01:53.363
All the details, all the time.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.699
This is awesome.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.367
A Saturday off.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.077
I mean, no homework, no practice.

01:59.161 --> 02:02.205
Yeah. We can just chill at Austin's
and watch a bunch of movies.

02:03.749 --> 02:04.750
Yo, what's up?

02:06.043 --> 02:07.544
Your chariot awaits.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.463
Hey, who's that dude with your mom?

02:09.920 --> 02:11.715
I don't know, but he looks familiar.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.384
I'll introduce you.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.344
Hi, Vera.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.427
Hello.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.764
Hi. Oh, I love your umbrella.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.515
There's a 75 percent probability of rain

02:20.599 --> 02:21.743
due to the tropical storm Cecil

02:21.767 --> 02:23.894
developing over the Pacific ocean.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.104
Hi, Austin.

02:26.188 --> 02:27.230
Hi guys.

02:27.314 --> 02:30.150
Austin, you remember Mark, don't you?

02:30.233 --> 02:31.360
Hi, Mark Rowin.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.695
Your dad and I were roommates at college.

02:33.779 --> 02:35.781
I met you a bunch of times
when you were younger.

02:35.864 --> 02:36.698
Right.

02:36.782 --> 02:38.033
So what's going on?

02:38.116 --> 02:39.576
You going somewhere?

02:40.035 --> 02:42.704
I'm going to take your mom for brunch.

02:42.788 --> 02:43.955
If that's okay.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.416
Yeah, brunch.

02:46.917 --> 02:47.834
Sure.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.753
Well, I'll see you later, okay?

02:51.338 --> 02:52.547
Be good.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.257
It was good to see you again, Austin.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.767
Weirdness overload?

03:06.019 --> 03:07.187
Yeah.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.189
Kinda.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.414
Come on, Megabyte.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.290
I need access.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.604
Such an entertaining spectacle.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.150
The weather satellite security
has been eliminated, Megabyte.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.776
Excellent.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.654
What are you waiting for, Alpha Sentinel?

03:57.738 --> 03:59.781
Set up the perimeter blockade!

03:59.865 --> 04:00.865
Yes, Megabyte.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.242
Megabyte.

04:02.367 --> 04:03.994
<i>Make sure there are no interruptions.</i>

04:04.077 --> 04:05.579
<i>No disturbances.</i>

04:05.746 --> 04:08.331
Once I take control of this
weather satellite

04:08.582 --> 04:11.126
I'm going to wipe out an entire coastline.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.936
<i>Tropical storm Cecil
rages on over the Pacific ocean</i>

04:30.020 --> 04:31.938
<i>with its trajectory now steering it clear</i>

04:32.022 --> 04:33.482
<i>from making landfall,</i>

04:33.565 --> 04:36.526
<i>but coastal residents are still
advised to be prepared.</i>

04:36.985 --> 04:38.570
- <i>Stay tuned to WPKW...</i>
- Hi.

04:38.653 --> 04:41.323
<i>- for 24 hour weather updates and alerts.</i>
- First day, kids.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.009
<i>- The latest international conditions...</i>
- Flashlight...

04:43.033 --> 04:45.535
<i>- and local regional forecasts.</i>
- Candles...

04:46.286 --> 04:47.871
Canned vegetables.

04:48.163 --> 04:51.374
Canned beans, canned tuna.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.584
Yum.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.147
Is that what we're having for dinner?

04:54.211 --> 04:57.047
No, Mr. Sarcastic.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.341
I'm making sure our emergency
survival kit is ready.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.051
There's a tropical storm coming.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.428
I think you're overreacting.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.222
They say it's not gonna hit us.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.641
Well, better safe than sorry.

05:10.352 --> 05:15.148
So, uh... what's the deal
with you and Mark Rowin?

05:17.192 --> 05:19.361
Oh.

05:19.444 --> 05:22.531
There's no deal, Austin.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.910
Mark just called me the other day to ask
if I'd meet him for a cup of coffee.

05:26.993 --> 05:31.331
So I did and then, uh, we
went out for brunch today.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.542
So that's, like, two dates.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.587
Yeah... we're not dating.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.755
We...

05:43.468 --> 05:45.011
He's a nice guy, Austin.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.489
And he's your father's friend.

05:46.513 --> 05:49.182
He's not some stranger
so you don't have to worry.

05:49.266 --> 05:50.809
It's only been a year, mom.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.105
I know.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.318
But we're doing okay, right?

06:00.694 --> 06:03.822
I mean, this house is starting
to feel like home,

06:03.905 --> 06:05.824
you figured out the new school,

06:05.907 --> 06:07.951
my work is going well at the hospital.

06:10.161 --> 06:14.499
Maybe it's time that we focus
on what's ahead of us

06:15.417 --> 06:18.044
rather than what's behind.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.130
That was always your dad's outlook.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.341
So you're just gonna forget
he ever existed?

06:24.342 --> 06:25.802
No.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.429
Of course not.

06:29.055 --> 06:32.392
But it doesn't mean I have
to give up on being happy,

06:32.475 --> 06:33.643
does it?

06:39.691 --> 06:42.027
I gotta catch up with my friends.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.237
- Austin...
- I'll talk to you later, Mom.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.616
Take an umbrella.

06:49.701 --> 06:53.747
I've tracked Megabyte to a military
weather satellite's on-board computer.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.915
Wait, like, in outer space?

06:55.999 --> 06:59.961
Yes. It is in the thermal sphere.
100 kilometers above the Earth.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.130
What do you think Megabyte's up to?

07:06.384 --> 07:08.762
The satellite is currently
in range of Tropical Storm Cecil

07:08.845 --> 07:10.931
developing over the Pacific ocean.

07:11.181 --> 07:16.144
There is a 67 percent probability
the two are related.

07:16.227 --> 07:19.230
If that's the case,
Megabyte isn't working alone here.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.191
Yeah.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.258
For sure the Sourcerer is involved.

07:23.693 --> 07:24.986
Come on, let's go.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.700
Please use caution.

07:36.331 --> 07:37.374
Come on.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.356
<i>The codec is patched
into a satellite signal</i>

07:43.380 --> 07:44.899
that will take you to
the weather satellite's

07:44.923 --> 07:46.549
on-board computer.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.051
So let me get this straight.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.763
We are in outer space and
cyber space at the same time?

07:51.846 --> 07:54.724
We will be once we get to the
weather satellite's computer.

07:54.808 --> 07:55.892
Cool.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.366
<i>Well, this is an
unprecedented development</i>

08:35.390 --> 08:36.640
<i>over the Pacific ocean.</i>

08:36.725 --> 08:39.102
<i>This tropical storm Cecil
has just been upgraded</i>

08:39.184 --> 08:44.190
<i>to a category one hurricane with winds
reaching 100 kilometers per hour,</i>

08:44.274 --> 08:45.567
<i>and a sudden change in direction</i>

08:45.650 --> 08:48.778
<i>has this one headed straight
toward the west coast.</i>

08:49.029 --> 08:50.280
Yes.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.574
Exactly as I planned.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.163
The codec sensors are detecting dark code.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.998
I knew the Sourcerer was behind this.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.541
You know, my dad used to talk about

09:01.624 --> 09:05.003
the military secret experiments
using weather as a weapon.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.422
I bet the Sourcerer's gonna try
and hack the satellite

09:07.505 --> 09:09.466
and weather-mod that tropical storm.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.925
Weather-mod? What's that?

09:11.009 --> 09:12.969
The most common method
is called "cloud seeding".

09:13.053 --> 09:14.447
It's a way of changing the micro-physical

09:14.471 --> 09:16.222
processes of clouds.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.892
So the Sourcerer could control the storm.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.537
There's the military
weather satellite computer.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.313
Surrounded by a digital mine field.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.648
It'll take forever to steer around them.

09:26.858 --> 09:28.359
Or we could just do this.

09:32.822 --> 09:33.907
Oh, yeah!

09:33.990 --> 09:35.158
Game on!

09:45.502 --> 09:46.628
Guardians.

09:46.711 --> 09:50.048
You won't stop me from
ripping up the coastline,

09:50.131 --> 09:54.803
decimating it,
with the worst storm in history.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.352
<i>Well, hurricane Cecil
has jumped now to a category three,</i>

10:02.435 --> 10:05.438
<i>the winds are exceeding
180 kilometers an hour.</i>

10:05.522 --> 10:08.566
<i>So this drastic transformation
has the experts confounded</i>

10:08.650 --> 10:12.487
<i>with landfall now expected
in 45 minutes or less...</i>

10:13.822 --> 10:14.697
<i>Hi, this is Austin.</i>

10:14.781 --> 10:15.698
<i>Sorry I missed your call.</i>

10:15.782 --> 10:17.242
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

10:17.325 --> 10:20.411
Austin, you and Vera
need to come home right now.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.247
Or better yet, stay where you are.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.373
Don't go outside.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.332
I mean it.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.543
This storm is serious.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.837
Just call me, okay?

10:28.920 --> 10:30.213
Please?

10:42.559 --> 10:44.999
Alright, let's get to the
weather satellite computer.

10:52.235 --> 10:55.488
The cyber mines have proved insufficient,

10:55.822 --> 10:57.490
but the guardians will not survive

10:57.574 --> 10:59.742
a full-scale sentinel assault!

10:59.826 --> 11:00.910
Attack!

11:03.079 --> 11:04.914
Okay. Enigma, D-Frag, you draw them away.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.709
Coogz and I will get inside
the port near the top.

11:07.792 --> 11:08.710
And then what?

11:08.793 --> 11:10.187
And then you'll come up
with some brilliant way

11:10.211 --> 11:11.611
to take control from the Sourcerer.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.431
Huh? Great.
Glad you have it all figured out.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.384
Okay, let's get busy, Enigma.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.308
Energy shurikens!

11:25.768 --> 11:26.978
Bash tagger!

11:34.235 --> 11:35.737
- Nice one!
- Vector, Coogz?

11:35.820 --> 11:36.905
Time to make your move!

11:37.655 --> 11:39.407
Okay, we got this.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.952
Uh-oh. This wasn't part of your plan.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.663
You didn't think we'd be able
to just walk right in, did you?

11:47.874 --> 11:49.083
Code disruptor!

11:56.299 --> 11:57.508
Deflector ring!

11:58.301 --> 11:59.761
Okay, Coogz. Let's get inside.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.597
Do not allow the guardians access.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.814
Firewall!

12:13.900 --> 12:15.276
Sorry, no more joiners!

12:18.655 --> 12:20.936
Whoa. Looks like Megabyte's brought
the whole army.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.660
Yeah. Hey, Vera,
wanna get in on this action?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.703
Yes. That would be most appealing.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.197
Fragging sentinels has become

12:27.246 --> 12:28.706
one of my favorite pastimes.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.378
Here she comes.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.092
Whoa.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.134
<i>Nice shooting, Vera.</i>

12:54.399 --> 12:55.650
Guardians.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.527
When will you learn?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.404
I won't be stopped.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.717
<i>Hurricane Cecil has now just been upgraded</i>

13:03.741 --> 13:05.410
<i>to category four.</i>

13:05.493 --> 13:07.745
And landfall is just minutes away.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.790
The west coast will be devastated.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.542
Homes will be destroyed.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.253
People will suffer.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.172
The perfect storm.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.197
<i>The Department of Internet Security</i>

13:25.221 --> 13:29.308
<i>now believes that the devious

<i>is controlling the hurricane</i>

13:33.604 --> 13:34.439
Mark, I don't know what to do.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.190
I can't reach them.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.277
Okay, I'll let you know.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.988
Yes, thank you.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.614
Bye.

13:47.785 --> 13:48.703
Hey, Vector?

13:48.786 --> 13:50.371
Check this out.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.330
Whoa.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.374
We're cyber astronauts.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.044
Find the guardians!

13:56.127 --> 13:57.795
Do not let them interfere!

13:58.337 --> 13:59.964
Enough stargazing. Let's move.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.106
Keep searching!

14:17.190 --> 14:18.775
They are in here somewhere!

14:19.025 --> 14:20.109
They're getting close.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.402
Yeah, but so are we.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.653
There's the processor.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.326
- Can you hack it?
- I can try.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.660
Ow!

14:29.869 --> 14:31.412
Dark code booby trap.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.498
Guardians.

14:33.581 --> 14:38.669
In 184 seconds the hurricane
will be too close

14:38.753 --> 14:40.713
to land to alter its course.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.758
You must deactivate the
on-board computer immediately.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.259
I can't get in.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.136
There's too much dark code to bypass.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.055
So forget bypassing the dark code.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.015
We're just gonna have to blow up the CPU.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.059
<i>Coogz, we need a bomb.</i>

14:53.142 --> 14:55.228
Vector, that could set off
a chain reaction

14:55.311 --> 14:57.897
and cause the entire satellite to explode.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.024
Hey, we gotta do what we gotta do, Vera.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.901
<i>People's lives are at risk.</i>

15:02.568 --> 15:04.487
Okay, I can make a high pressure explosive

15:04.695 --> 15:06.781
if you provide the charge
with your code disruptor.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.825
It'll increase it to the power of 50.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.327
See? I knew you'd come up
with something brilliant.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.870
Ha. So did I.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.874
Ah-ha! There they are!

15:18.167 --> 15:19.377
Hold steady.

15:20.962 --> 15:22.296
Stop them at once!

15:22.380 --> 15:24.173
No stopping now, it's go time!

15:25.466 --> 15:26.509
I got it!

15:27.301 --> 15:28.469
- Whoa!
- Zip board!

15:28.553 --> 15:29.554
Quadra disc!

15:35.393 --> 15:36.745
Dude, nothing's happening!

15:36.769 --> 15:37.645
Trust me, it will.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.480
The pressure's gonna amp up the charge.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.649
But it might take a minute.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.050
D-Frag, Enigma, we gotta move!

15:49.115 --> 15:50.533
This thing's gonna blow!

15:51.033 --> 15:52.827
Great, thanks for the warning.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.830
Right behind you.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.033
And so is Megabyte!

15:59.834 --> 16:02.211
You won't get away, guardians!

16:04.797 --> 16:07.300
What? The DIS patrol?

16:08.509 --> 16:11.137
Sentinels, defend your master!

16:11.345 --> 16:12.763
Look what just showed up.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.015
The DIS.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.281
Hey, we're the good guys!

16:30.865 --> 16:32.283
Clearly they don't know that.

16:33.201 --> 16:35.536
Vera, we need a quick exit.

16:35.620 --> 16:36.829
<i>Coming right up.</i>

16:39.457 --> 16:40.875
Home free. Huh?

16:41.083 --> 16:43.085
Running away is so unbecoming.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.630
Stay and face your fate!

16:47.340 --> 16:48.591
Whoa!

16:50.468 --> 16:51.928
Good riddance!

16:52.261 --> 16:53.262
Blink!

16:56.516 --> 16:57.516
No!

17:00.228 --> 17:01.521
Now I'm home free.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.101
Guardians.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.854
You keep getting in my way.

17:44.438 --> 17:45.940
But that will soon end.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.151
I promise.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.253
Cyber astronauts have returned.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.671
That was so rad.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.339
Wish I could vlog about it.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.759
The important thing is that we stopped
that storm from hitting the coast.

18:14.135 --> 18:17.072
<i>Drastic action was taken
by the Department of Internet Security</i>

18:17.096 --> 18:19.599
<i>to destroy a military weather satellite</i>

18:19.682 --> 18:23.185
<i>causing the escalation of
hurricane Cecil's magnitude.</i>

18:23.394 --> 18:25.938
The DIS sure is good about
taking credit they don't deserve.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.040
<i>Fortunately,
the storm only caused</i>

18:27.064 --> 18:29.692
<i>minor power outages and minimal damage
to property</i>

18:29.775 --> 18:31.402
<i>in several coastal communities.</i>

18:32.153 --> 18:34.530
<i>Cecil has returned
to tropical storm status</i>

18:34.614 --> 18:37.450
<i>and moved safely away from the coastline.</i>

18:37.658 --> 18:40.620
<i>Evidence points to this being
the biggest attack yet</i>

18:40.703 --> 18:42.997
<i>by the hacker known as the Sourcerer.</i>

18:43.456 --> 18:45.082
We got that guy's number.

18:45.916 --> 18:47.996
Even if we don't get the props
for shutting him down.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.837
Austin, please check your phone.

18:49.920 --> 18:50.963
Judy called.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.174
- She did?
- Yes.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.425
Eleven times.

18:58.346 --> 19:00.556
Vera, we gotta go.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.187
I've got some apologizing to do.

19:17.073 --> 19:20.076
Oh. Well, thank you for finally texting me

19:20.159 --> 19:21.911
to let me know that you were both alive.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.872
I'm sorry, my phone was dead and...

19:25.081 --> 19:26.207
Oh.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.000
Sorry if you were worried.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.250
I was.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.170
Very worried.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.466
Okay, but you're both here.

19:35.549 --> 19:36.467
It's okay.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.136
And I wanted you to know

19:39.220 --> 19:44.016
that if you wanted to date
Mark Rowin or whatever

19:44.100 --> 19:45.267
I'm cool with that, too.

19:47.436 --> 19:48.646
Austin, I...

19:48.729 --> 19:51.732
I also have no concerns about your
romantic intentions with Mark Rowin.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.568
Oh. Okay.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.155
I'm... I'm glad that you...
That you both approve.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.825
Thank you.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.805
- Hi.
- We were just talking about you.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.580
Oh, okay. Good things, I hope.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.499
Of course. What're you doing here?

20:08.582 --> 20:10.751
Well, I brought food.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.586
That's so sweet.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.881
Yeah. Well, I knew that, um,
you were upset

20:15.965 --> 20:17.485
and maybe hadn't thought about dinner.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.177
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.054
Hey, come on. Let's dig in.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.723
We've got a lot to celebrate.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.058
Celebrate? Like what?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.895
Well, like the fact that we didn't get hit

20:29.979 --> 20:31.731
by a violent hurricane today.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.414
I mean, that's pretty special, isn't it?

20:33.441 --> 20:34.483
Yeah.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.862
That did work out kinda good.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.092
To think that that storm
was being controlled

20:42.116 --> 20:44.326
by some twisted creep with a computer.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.912
I know.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.080
Crazy, right?

20:48.539 --> 20:50.499
The Sourcerer is a threat to all humanity.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.209
He's a very sick individual.

20:56.005 --> 20:58.048
Would you guys excuse me for a sec?
It's work.

20:58.382 --> 20:59.884
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.054
Yes?

21:05.097 --> 21:06.097
Yes.

21:08.058 --> 21:09.351
I understand.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.607
I got this under control.
