All right, Malia,
stay in your lane!

00:55.142 --> 00:58.101
Left wing, Julie!
Left wing!

00:58.145 --> 01:00.016
Come on, girls,
hustle up!

01:00.060 --> 01:02.540
Good job, Warriors, good job!

01:03.846 --> 01:07.328
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the field.

01:07.371 --> 01:08.981
I need everyone to move back
to the parking lot.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.983
Bring all your stuff with you.

01:11.027 --> 01:13.377
Come on, move down
to the parking lot.

01:13.421 --> 01:14.900
Move back down to
the parking lot.

01:14.944 --> 01:15.945
Thank you.

01:15.988 --> 01:17.120
All right, Warriors,
bring it in,

01:17.164 --> 01:18.339
bring it in.

01:19.427 --> 01:22.125
Mom, I don't know
anything about soccer.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.909
They don't care.
Just have fun, okay?

01:23.953 --> 01:25.868
Go be with your team.
I love you. Mmm.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.348
Come on, get off the field,
off the field.

02:11.566 --> 02:13.568
Secure a perimeter
and 24-hour security

02:13.611 --> 02:17.137
while we recover
all classified components, okay?

02:17.180 --> 02:18.747
Excuse me, Captain.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.792
You can't move anything.
This is a crime scene.

02:21.184 --> 02:23.752
Jane Tennant, Special Agent
in Charge, NCIS Hawai'i.

02:23.795 --> 02:26.624
Well, Special Agent
in Charge Tennant,

02:26.668 --> 02:28.583
I'm Captain Joseph Milius.

02:28.626 --> 02:30.628
Deputy Chief of Staff,
Pac Fleet. I know.

02:30.672 --> 02:33.631
Then I suspect
you also know the protocol

02:33.675 --> 02:35.720
for investigating an accident
involving a Navy pilot.

02:35.764 --> 02:38.462
Can we talk for a minute...
privately?

02:38.506 --> 02:40.247
Will it end
this conversation sooner?

02:40.290 --> 02:41.509
It's worth a shot.

02:44.294 --> 02:46.470
Look, you can't be so sure
this was an accident.

02:46.514 --> 02:48.255
Because?

02:48.298 --> 02:50.300
Because your pilot,
Lieutenant Commander Walters,

02:50.344 --> 02:52.302
reached out to my office
12 hours ago.

02:52.346 --> 02:53.695
Wanted to file
a report.

02:53.738 --> 02:55.175
- About what?
- Don't know.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.177
Until I do,
this is a crime scene.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.179
Well, call this site
whatever you want,

02:59.222 --> 03:00.571
but this is
a top secret Navy program,

03:00.615 --> 03:01.703
and I've got a job to do.

03:01.746 --> 03:03.922
I know your next move, Captain.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.579
Gonna run this up
the chain of command?

03:08.623 --> 03:10.886
But what's gonna come back down
is that I'm in charge.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.757
So all you're doing is
delaying my investigation,

03:12.801 --> 03:14.368
which isn't fair
to Commander Walters,

03:14.411 --> 03:16.326
his family...

03:16.370 --> 03:18.372
or even you.

03:23.855 --> 03:25.683
You should tell the wolf pack
this was your idea.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.685
It'll sell better.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.383
Let's give it a
beat, Tennant.

03:30.949 --> 03:33.604
Make it more believable.

03:36.651 --> 03:39.349
<i>Someone want to say
how the fists started flying?</i>

03:39.393 --> 03:42.396
- This punk wen touch my girl.
- Just her nice necklace.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.485
Okay, that's it--
you're coming in.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.530
- Hey, those guys started it!
- Keep it up and you'll go, too.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.619
Officers, please,
your tactics

03:48.663 --> 03:51.622
are just really
harshing my mellow.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.798
How about you mind
your own business, sir?

03:53.842 --> 03:55.757
Look, um...

03:55.800 --> 03:58.716
Had a pretty simple
situation here.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.371
These clowns disrespected
the barkeep.

04:01.415 --> 04:03.243
My tattooed friend there
tried to defend her honor.

04:03.286 --> 04:04.244
And then, uh,

04:04.287 --> 04:05.288
what do you do?

04:05.332 --> 04:06.724
You separate them? No.

04:06.768 --> 04:08.683
You have
a thoughtful conversation

04:08.726 --> 04:09.901
about the power
of listening? No.

04:09.945 --> 04:11.338
You kick ass, you take names,

04:11.381 --> 04:12.817
and then you hope
no one's filming.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.906
Your I.D. Now.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.734
I haven't done anything wrong,
so there's absolutely

04:16.778 --> 04:18.388
no reason for me
to share that with you.

04:18.432 --> 04:19.781
All right, wise guy.

04:19.824 --> 04:21.391
You're going in, too.

04:21.435 --> 04:22.740
It's escalation.

04:25.352 --> 04:26.744
Let's go.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.763
- Morning.
- Morning.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.727
Ooh, pajama day?

04:52.770 --> 04:53.945
I wish.

04:53.989 --> 04:56.383
Youth soccer game
at almost dark thirty.

04:56.426 --> 04:57.645
I'm gonna need the rundown
on our dead pilot

04:57.688 --> 04:58.646
Lieutenant Commander Walters.

04:58.689 --> 05:00.691
Background, fitreps...

05:00.735 --> 05:02.998
Current assignment, friends
and family, recent activity.

05:03.041 --> 05:06.044
And dark Holualoa,
splash of soy.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.959
I have AFMES fast-tracking
the autopsy.

05:08.003 --> 05:09.613
Was there anything left
to autopsy?

05:09.657 --> 05:13.051
- Experimental F-35
- C had
an emergency fail-safe.

05:13.095 --> 05:15.576
Plane goes out of control,
automatic ejection.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.055
Although at that speed,
the force of it

05:17.099 --> 05:18.056
is probably what killed him.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.536
4-H weekend?

05:19.580 --> 05:21.886
No, cleaning campsites
at Bellows Field.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.975
Here.

05:24.019 --> 05:26.369
Jesse, it's my day,
remember?

05:26.413 --> 05:28.458
Oh, well,
where's the new guy?

05:28.502 --> 05:31.418
Not sure, but at some
point, that will get old.

05:31.461 --> 05:32.854
All right, guys,
what else do we know?

05:32.897 --> 05:35.422
Our pilot was at the
stick of a top secret

05:35.465 --> 05:37.989
experimental aircraft with
self-flying capabilities.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.643
He called last night,
told the switchboard

05:39.687 --> 05:41.384
he had something to report.
Did he say what?

05:41.428 --> 05:42.864
No. I left him a voice mail.

05:42.907 --> 05:44.648
But he never returned.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.476
Could be criminal activity,
fraud,

05:46.520 --> 05:48.870
security leak,
something personal.

05:48.913 --> 05:50.741
And the crash could be
completely unrelated.

05:50.785 --> 05:52.352
All right, well, the program's
on hold until we figure out

05:52.395 --> 05:53.744
what happened, so that's
gonna create some heat.

05:53.788 --> 05:55.006
So, Lucy, I need
you to go to AFMES

05:55.050 --> 05:56.834
to get
the autopsy results.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.401
Jesse, I need you to... Hook up with Ernie.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.577
Dive into Commander Walter's
private life.

06:00.621 --> 06:02.492
Please and thank you.

06:06.104 --> 06:08.106
I got to
handle something.

06:14.417 --> 06:15.592
Mandarin?

06:15.636 --> 06:18.508
Yeah. I want to read <i>
Journey to the West</i>

06:18.552 --> 06:20.118
in the original
as Wu Cheng'en intended.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.425
Hey.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.601
I'm trying to get some insight
into Lieutenant Commander...

06:24.645 --> 06:26.690
Lieutenant Commander
David Walters.

06:26.734 --> 06:29.693
Graduated U.S. Naval Academy
with distinction.

06:29.737 --> 06:32.783
Multiple combat tours.
Went Top Gun three years ago.

06:32.827 --> 06:35.395
Transferred to the Pathfinders
as a test pilot

06:35.438 --> 06:36.831
- and instructor.
- Ernie?

06:36.874 --> 06:38.876
I'm looking for more color.

06:38.920 --> 06:42.619
Like why he was coming
into NCIS before the kaboom?

06:42.663 --> 06:44.578
Don't sweat it.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.710
I'll just piggyback
on his social media,

06:46.754 --> 06:48.669
get a full sense of the
man-- hopes, dreams,

06:48.712 --> 06:50.671
weird fetishes if he had any.

06:50.714 --> 06:53.413
I don't think Walters had
social media, though.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.153
Some fighter pilots
don't.

06:55.197 --> 06:57.460
Everyone else does.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.723
His friends, family,
dental hygienist.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.725
He may not post,

07:01.769 --> 07:03.423
but they certainly do.

07:03.466 --> 07:05.163
I'm headed to the pilot's
apartment-- call me.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.736
How'd you know
where I was?

07:12.780 --> 07:15.086
Deputy sergeant texted me
when he saw your credentials.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.698
You know, I got
over 50 résumés for your job.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.526
Interviewed a dozen highly capable

07:19.569 --> 07:21.092
candidates,
including you.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.616
Getting arrested two weeks in

07:22.659 --> 07:24.182
makes me question my judgement.

07:24.226 --> 07:27.185
Cops at the bar weren't
being professional.

07:27.229 --> 07:30.537
Local and vocal don't
always jibe, and it was

07:30.580 --> 07:31.929
my obligation to correct
their behavior.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.453
No need to involve
the badge.

07:33.496 --> 07:35.324
Look, I won't pretend
to know your experiences.

07:35.367 --> 07:36.499
And I respect
where you're coming from.

07:36.543 --> 07:37.631
- Thank you.
- Not done.

07:37.674 --> 07:40.372
When anyone on my team
gets in trouble,

07:40.416 --> 07:41.852
I'm the first call.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.898
Can't help
if I don't know.

07:43.941 --> 07:45.943
You can't live
with that,

07:45.987 --> 07:47.597
this isn't gonna work.

07:49.294 --> 07:51.862
Understood. Won't happen again.

07:55.779 --> 07:57.651
Hi. I'm gonna need

07:57.694 --> 08:00.262
Commander Walters'
preliminary results ASAP.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.612
- Almost done.
Gonna have to wait.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.353
Whistler.

08:04.396 --> 08:06.311
What's DIA doing here?"What are you doing here?"

08:06.355 --> 08:07.574
is a more pertinent question.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.750
Investigating a suspicious death.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.882
Of a pilot who worked
a top secret defense project?

08:11.926 --> 08:14.450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Silos, clearances, stakeholders.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.452
Spare me. We've been read in.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.280
No, and yet,
Pac-Fleet asked

08:18.323 --> 08:20.587
DIA to handle the dissemination
of sensitive information,

08:20.630 --> 08:22.763
so you will get the report
when I clear it.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.329
Thank you.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.863
You're right.

08:35.906 --> 08:37.734
- I know.
- I shouldn't be so pushy.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.997
- It's not a good look.
- And I should respect
the hierarchy.

08:40.041 --> 08:42.478
Hmm, that'd be refreshing.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.524
You still can't see it.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.052
No, it's Inoki.

08:51.095 --> 08:53.794
- Can you spell that?
- I-N-O-K-I.

08:53.837 --> 08:56.057
- K-I? Okay.
- Yeah.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.450
- Give me an hour.
- All right, I'll call
back later, bye.

08:58.494 --> 09:00.409
Hey, sorry.

09:02.411 --> 09:04.761
- Got tied up.
- Not to pile on, New Guy.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.981
But I abandoned a conservation
weekend to get here.

09:07.024 --> 09:08.809
What's your excuse?

09:08.852 --> 09:10.854
Got locked up by HPD.

09:13.422 --> 09:15.076
Hey, it's been two weeks.

09:15.119 --> 09:17.687
New Guy has a name.

09:17.731 --> 09:20.385
Kai Holman.
Born in Waimanalo.

09:20.429 --> 09:22.649
Still holds the record
for the most strikeouts

09:22.692 --> 09:24.651
in the
Interscholastic League.

09:24.694 --> 09:27.044
Former Marine,
including three years CID

09:27.088 --> 09:29.046
before joining NCIS.

09:29.090 --> 09:31.048
See, I listen.
It's not bad.

09:31.092 --> 09:32.746
And, uh, you are Jesse...

09:32.789 --> 09:34.051
something with a B?

09:40.841 --> 09:43.626
Don't see a lot of uniforms
in places like these.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.759
No photos, no
bottles of booze.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.630
TV's covered in dust.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.545
Walters was a slave
to his work.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.766
But he's going to local
places all over the island.

09:52.809 --> 09:55.725
Anything suggest he had,
like, a drug problem?

09:56.944 --> 09:59.033
Nah, squad-mates say
in the last few weeks

09:59.076 --> 10:01.122
Walters was withdrawn
and worn out.

10:01.165 --> 10:03.385
But wasn't saying why.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.169
Let's check the bedroom.

10:10.784 --> 10:13.700
Commander Walters had a massive
amount of dextroamphetamine

10:13.743 --> 10:16.093
in his system-- 100
to 120 milligrams.

10:16.137 --> 10:17.834
There were signs
of toxic psychosis

10:17.878 --> 10:19.662
and probable cardiac arrest.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.621
Where's the
autopsy report?

10:21.664 --> 10:23.710
I didn't
technically get it.

10:23.753 --> 10:25.886
While Whistler read it,
I read it upside down.

10:27.670 --> 10:30.586
A trick I picked up during a
summer congressional internship.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.154
So we're looking at an overdose,
intentional or otherwise.

10:33.197 --> 10:36.505
All we found at his place
was a bunch of supplements.

10:36.548 --> 10:39.421
Though he's been hitting
every dive bar on the island.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.075
I only talked to Captain Milius
for about ten minutes,

10:41.118 --> 10:42.598
but he didn't seem like
the type of guy

10:42.642 --> 10:43.730
that would miss
one of his pilots

10:43.773 --> 10:44.905
having a drug addiction.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.472
There are pursuits
that compel a man

10:47.516 --> 10:49.126
to retreat
within himself.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.085
In the East, it is often
a sacred vow of silence.

10:51.128 --> 10:52.129
In the West, a girl.

10:52.173 --> 10:53.827
No sign of one at Walters'.

10:53.870 --> 10:56.133
Maybe not, but back
home in Grand Rapids,

10:56.177 --> 10:57.918
they were abuzz.

10:57.961 --> 10:59.833
Walters sent a photo
to his sister who tagged it

10:59.876 --> 11:01.835
for the rest of
the family to see.

11:01.878 --> 11:04.533
- Name's Noelani Ilihau.
- Local.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.100
Yep, and according
to his little sister,

11:06.143 --> 11:07.667
"she rocked his world."

11:07.710 --> 11:10.539
Noelani's social media
went dark a few weeks ago.

11:10.582 --> 11:12.759
I tracked the plates

11:12.802 --> 11:14.717
on the SUV in that photo.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.981
1999 Pathfinder with
expired registration.

11:18.025 --> 11:20.767
The original owner cared enough
to install LoJack.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.943
Of course, the, uh,
subscription lapsed.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.684
You able
to activate it?

11:26.511 --> 11:28.122
Yes.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.476
Turn back around again.

11:34.519 --> 11:37.653
According to LoJack,
we are literally on top of it.

11:44.094 --> 11:45.530
What are you doing?

11:45.574 --> 11:47.750
That Pathfinder's
clearly off-road.

11:47.794 --> 11:51.145
Some of these trails are
about 150 years old.

11:51.188 --> 11:52.973
So they're not gonna register
on that tablet.

11:53.016 --> 11:55.758
But...

11:55.802 --> 11:57.673
they will on this.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.544
OG GPS.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.242
All right.

12:01.285 --> 12:02.809
Here.

12:02.852 --> 12:06.508
You're gonna need
a hat and sunscreen.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.553
Let's go.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.993
That was a pretty fancy trick

12:13.036 --> 12:15.169
you pulled taking
a sneak peek at the autopsy.

12:15.212 --> 12:17.824
Yeah, not sure
Tennant thought so.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.782
You worked for her
a year now.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.828
You know she doesn't hide
where she stands.

12:21.871 --> 12:24.700
Jim Carter worked
for her longer.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.615
And she fired him.

12:26.658 --> 12:29.531
Jim Carter put himself
over the team.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.098
This is different.

12:31.141 --> 12:32.969
You put the team
over the mean girl.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.190
Hey, it's fine.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.148
I was here when Tennant took
over, so she obviously

12:38.192 --> 12:39.671
loves me best,
but I'm pretty sure

12:39.715 --> 12:41.151
you're her second favorite.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.154
You really think Noelani

12:44.198 --> 12:46.635
managed to get
her SUV down this way?

12:47.810 --> 12:49.116
I know she did.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.208
Someone tried to dump it.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.253
It...

12:59.822 --> 13:00.780
And her.

13:08.831 --> 13:12.792
M.E. thinks Noelani's been
here for days. Neck's broken.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.141
Car was in neutral,
she's just laid out across

13:14.184 --> 13:16.360
the driver's seat.
Doesn't look like an accident.

13:16.404 --> 13:18.319
Keep working
the scene.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.843
Hoping for an update?

13:20.887 --> 13:22.802
Accident seems
increasingly unlikely.

13:23.977 --> 13:26.022
Giving you wide berth here out
of respect for the position

13:26.066 --> 13:28.242
you're in, but Walters'
mother and sister

13:28.285 --> 13:29.852
are flying in
to take his remains.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.985
You know that can't happen
till this case is closed.

13:32.028 --> 13:33.987
There is no case.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.032
My people reviewed
the mission computer.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.947
Walters went
into G-LOC, Crashed.

13:37.991 --> 13:39.644
Commander Walters
had dextroamphetamine

13:39.688 --> 13:40.732
in his system.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.299
It's in the tox screen.

13:42.343 --> 13:44.258
And there are
extenuating circumstances.

13:44.301 --> 13:45.912
He was involved with a girl

13:45.955 --> 13:47.217
whose body was dumped
in the mountains.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.219
You implying he killed her,

13:49.263 --> 13:50.830
then killed himself
in that plane?

13:50.873 --> 13:51.831
I'm not implying
anything.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.007
Going where the case takes me.

13:55.704 --> 13:58.098
Your jacket says top
of your class at FLETC.

13:58.141 --> 14:01.362
Only agent to receive
the Medal of Merit three times.

14:01.405 --> 14:04.321
But you know what people say?

14:04.365 --> 14:06.323
You're stubborn

14:06.367 --> 14:08.848
and incapable
of staying in line.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.850
And if I were you,
they'd say I was

14:10.893 --> 14:13.156
persistent and dedicated.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.158
Look, people are paying
attention to this

14:15.202 --> 14:16.856
all the way up the chain.
One wrong move,

14:16.899 --> 14:18.379
won't just be you and me
taking the fall.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.381
It'll be your
team, too.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.893
I'm making your favorite.

14:53.936 --> 14:54.894
Medicine's in
the bag, Dad.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.591
- I got to split.
- Go stay.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.071
Eat this time.

14:58.114 --> 14:59.594
That boss of yours,
she's treating you like

14:59.637 --> 15:01.726
- she the mastah or something.
- No.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.598
No, she's not bad.

15:03.641 --> 15:06.122
Well, then she wouldn't mind
you eating some saimin.

15:07.863 --> 15:09.125
Here.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.735
Look what I found.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.653
Oh, and I ran
into your friend.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.177
The pretty wahine
with the long hair.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.483
- Hina?
- Yeah.

15:19.527 --> 15:22.182
Come as a big surprise
when I tell her you was home.

15:22.225 --> 15:24.793
Hey, we should have a party.

15:24.836 --> 15:27.491
And let everybody see you.

15:27.535 --> 15:29.754
Be <i>'ohana</i> again.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.588
Can't stay for dinner.
I got work.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.677
Hey, you sound like me
in the <i>hanabaddah</i> days.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.114
Yeah.

15:41.157 --> 15:43.464
Except I'm here
when <i>you</i> got sick.

15:43.507 --> 15:44.813
She wouldn't want this.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.946
It's a little too late
for you to start caring

15:46.989 --> 15:49.644
about what Mom wanted.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.689
<i>M.E.'s initial report</i>

15:51.733 --> 15:53.474
makes it pretty clear
Noelani was dead

15:53.517 --> 15:55.128
before she hit that ravine.

15:55.171 --> 15:57.173
There was material
under her fingernails.

15:57.217 --> 15:59.175
We've expedited
the DNA analysis.

15:59.219 --> 16:01.656
Nothing in Walters' report
points to him being violent.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.571
I don't think he killed her.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.486
Let's focus on Noelani,
Figure out who she was.

16:07.183 --> 16:08.576
Oh, crap.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.492
I need a word.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.668
Look, I can--Not with you. Her.

16:18.629 --> 16:21.023
I brought Commander Walters'
declassified incident report.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.069
- Oh, terrific.
- But I didn't need to.

16:23.112 --> 16:25.985
Because I was informed
by Captain Milius that NCIS

16:26.028 --> 16:27.725
already saw the report.
I told the captain

16:27.769 --> 16:29.989
the report hasn't left my sight.
That I take my work

16:30.032 --> 16:31.991
and security protocols
seriously.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.993
And he wondered
how that was possible,

16:34.036 --> 16:35.603
since I failed
so completely at both.

16:35.646 --> 16:38.519
I am filing a complaint
against your Special Agent.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.354
Look, if you have an issue,
it's with me.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.486
I'm the one who passed the
information to Captain Milius.

16:49.530 --> 16:52.446
Which you couldn't have done
if she hadn't stolen it.

16:52.489 --> 16:55.057
She just saw a few key phrases
on a report that you're now

16:55.101 --> 16:57.016
delivering to me.
No harm, no foul.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.583
No. Harm, foul.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.237
I'm an intelligenceofficer.

17:01.281 --> 17:03.109
My mission is to
protect the intel.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.286
And pissing off...

17:06.329 --> 17:08.375
future admirals
will not help my career.

17:08.418 --> 17:10.507
Can I see the report, please?

17:14.294 --> 17:16.948
And no need for a complaint.
I'll clear it up with Milius.

17:16.992 --> 17:20.387
With all due respect, he's more
pissed at you than he is at me.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.433
The lab analyzed the supplements

17:23.477 --> 17:25.479
from Commander Walters'
apartment.
Yes.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.611
Found high levels
of dextroamphetamine.

17:27.655 --> 17:30.136
They were spiked.

17:30.179 --> 17:33.182
This crash just got
a lot more complicated.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.969
Hey, Alex, get me some
lemongrass from outside.

17:38.013 --> 17:39.449
Or get the door!

17:39.493 --> 17:41.669
Hey, Mom, did I remain
the right one?

17:41.712 --> 17:44.280
Hang on, Jules.

17:44.324 --> 17:45.542
Alex!

17:46.587 --> 17:48.632
What?

17:48.676 --> 17:50.678
Oh, the door was open.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.332
Nothing.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.423
Hey, Mr. Ernie.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.512
Hey, Julie.

18:00.470 --> 18:03.386
Jesse and Lucy found Noelani's
phone at the crime scene.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.562
Pulled the SIM card--
online profile

18:05.606 --> 18:07.477
only goes back a few months.

18:07.521 --> 18:09.479
Most of her friends
on social media are bots.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.655
Most of her pictures are
photoshopped.

18:11.699 --> 18:14.354
Anything actually real
- about her?
- Well, she really worked

18:14.397 --> 18:17.139
as a cocktail waitress at
a place called Namaka Ale House.

18:17.183 --> 18:20.011
Paystubs go back a few weeks,
then they abruptly stop.

18:20.055 --> 18:22.013
Mmm,
stew smells amazing.

18:22.057 --> 18:23.580
Alex!

18:23.624 --> 18:25.278
I need you to finish dinner
and get your sister to bed.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.280
- On time.
- Why do I have to babysit?

18:27.323 --> 18:28.759
It's not
babysitting.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.674
It's helping, Alex, and that's

18:30.718 --> 18:33.329
what families do for each other.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.206
I'd add lemongrass.

18:40.249 --> 18:42.382
<i>Jane Tennant, NCIS.</i>

18:42.425 --> 18:45.036
I'm looking for information
on Noelani Ilihau.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.126
Not much to tell you.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.519
She cocktailed for a while,
one day didn't show.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.304
That didn't worry you?

18:51.347 --> 18:53.219
People come,
people go.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.134
That's the bar
business.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.136
Mind if I talk
to the staff?

18:59.094 --> 19:00.704
Look.

19:00.748 --> 19:03.185
You're just doing
your job, I get it.

19:03.229 --> 19:06.188
But this is the <i>pau hana</i> crowd.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.711
They want to relax.

19:07.755 --> 19:10.105
Can't do that
with cops around.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.759
Please?

19:14.631 --> 19:16.633
Another day, then.

19:22.117 --> 19:23.771
<i>Hey, Kai.
I was just about to call you.</i>

19:23.814 --> 19:25.816
Yeah, I'm just, uh,
at the office.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.297
Hey, those souvenirs
from the places he visited,

19:28.341 --> 19:30.430
there were dates on them,
some after she died.

19:30.473 --> 19:32.345
Walters was looking for her.

19:32.388 --> 19:34.129
And if he got shut down
at the bar she worked at,

19:34.173 --> 19:36.087
like I just did,
I'm guessing he didn't get far.

19:36.131 --> 19:40.135
Uh, one of the souvenirs is
from Ace's Surf Shop.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.832
I know someone there.
I'll check it out tomorrow.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.617
Send me the address.
I'll meet you.

19:43.660 --> 19:46.402
Look, I got to go alone.

19:46.446 --> 19:49.318
You're new, so you haven't
had the pleasure of my

19:49.362 --> 19:50.841
"we work as a team" speech,

19:50.885 --> 19:52.582
but you can guess
the bullet points.

19:52.626 --> 19:55.411
Allow me to impress you, okay?

19:55.455 --> 19:57.631
And I will let you know
what I know

19:57.674 --> 19:59.763
as-as soon as I know it.

19:59.807 --> 20:02.157
<i>Okay, I look forward
to being impressed.</i>

20:10.296 --> 20:13.212
Hey, Hina,
I think you, uh,

20:13.255 --> 20:15.823
missed a few spots
there, yeah?

20:19.392 --> 20:21.394
Look, I know
it's been a while--

20:25.833 --> 20:27.487
Welcome home, brah.

20:36.757 --> 20:38.802
Here.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.239
Where's da aloha?

20:40.282 --> 20:42.110
I got to hear from your pops
that you're back.

20:42.153 --> 20:44.330
- I've been busy.
- No, you've been hiding.

20:48.421 --> 20:50.858
So why you come now?

20:54.905 --> 20:56.777
Honestly...

20:56.820 --> 20:58.213
work.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.393
A pilot had this

21:04.437 --> 21:06.830
at his house.
And he died.

21:06.874 --> 21:08.832
And then we just found his
girlfriend yesterday murdered.

21:08.876 --> 21:10.138
I don't know
about no murders.

21:10.181 --> 21:12.836
Yeah, but, look,
maybe you...

21:12.880 --> 21:14.360
maybe you know her.

21:14.403 --> 21:16.100
Name's Noelani.

21:16.144 --> 21:17.754
That's not her name.

21:17.798 --> 21:20.191
This is Allana.

21:20.235 --> 21:23.369
We used to hang with her cuz
from Nanakuli High.

21:23.412 --> 21:25.849
She taught the wahine
tourists how to drop

21:25.893 --> 21:27.242
in on the two-footers

21:27.286 --> 21:29.418
until someone offered her
a new job a while back.

21:29.462 --> 21:31.246
What kind of job?

21:35.250 --> 21:37.731
Look, I'm here so that
other cops won't be.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.733
You can talk
to me, okay?

21:39.776 --> 21:41.082
We're <i>hoaaloha.</i>

21:41.125 --> 21:43.345
Yeah, the same friend
that joined the Marines

21:43.389 --> 21:45.304
and left for
the mainland.

21:45.347 --> 21:46.914
Not even a "see ya."I had to leave, Hina.

21:46.957 --> 21:48.350
I didn't want
to talk about it.

21:48.394 --> 21:49.699
And now, not even
a "hey, I'm back."

21:49.743 --> 21:50.831
I understand that
you're mad at me.

21:50.874 --> 21:53.050
Look, we all got
our troubles, Kai.

21:53.094 --> 21:54.835
Still...

21:54.878 --> 21:56.750
you never turn your back
on the ocean.

22:01.363 --> 22:04.279
What about Allana's troubles?

22:07.804 --> 22:09.850
Some buggah offered her
a job.

22:09.893 --> 22:11.982
Sort of like a hostess.

22:12.026 --> 22:14.463
Get close to the guys.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.813
Make them feel special.
Paid good.

22:16.857 --> 22:18.859
Sounded sketchy to me.

22:18.902 --> 22:20.469
Who made the offer?

22:20.513 --> 22:22.993
I don't know.
Never saw him.

22:23.037 --> 22:25.431
Had a funny kine nickname.

22:27.302 --> 22:29.043
Big Luna.

22:29.086 --> 22:32.394
Nothing in any law
enforcement database

22:32.438 --> 22:34.265
about a Big Luna-- either
he knows how to stay hidden

22:34.309 --> 22:36.006
or your source was
playing you.

22:36.050 --> 22:38.400
If my source says there's
a Big Luna, there's a Big Luna.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.924
All right, well, let's
focus on Noelani or Allana.

22:40.968 --> 22:42.883
What else do we know?

22:44.319 --> 22:45.929
Don Sloane.

22:45.973 --> 22:47.757
Dated our girl
a few months last year.

22:47.801 --> 22:49.846
She disappeared, he filed
a missing persons report.

22:49.890 --> 22:51.761
He's a DOD engineer?

22:51.805 --> 22:53.850
- And works top secret aircraft.
- Local girl

22:53.894 --> 22:56.244
dates guys with need-to-know
information, works them

22:56.287 --> 22:58.464
until she becomes a ghost.

22:58.507 --> 23:00.466
So at best we're dealing
with a con woman. At worst...

23:00.509 --> 23:03.077
- A spy.
- So I'm guessing whoever's
running the ring

23:03.120 --> 23:05.209
killed Allana when Walters
started looking for her.

23:05.253 --> 23:06.950
Made sure that she couldn't
be tied back to them

23:06.994 --> 23:08.474
and then made sure
Walters stayed quiet, too.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.780
Well, me showing up at the
Ale House is gonna spook them.

23:10.824 --> 23:12.869
Where's Don Sloane now?

23:14.523 --> 23:16.177
He's locked his location apps.

23:16.220 --> 23:17.439
See if he has a fitness tracker.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.528
Guys got busted using
them on deployment.

23:19.572 --> 23:20.964
Dudes take every precaution

23:21.008 --> 23:22.357
until they want
to log their miles.

23:23.837 --> 23:25.491
Huh, he does.

23:26.970 --> 23:29.495
Also got an anonymous IP
logged into his account.

23:29.538 --> 23:32.193
We're not the only ones
tracking him.

23:57.392 --> 23:58.480
You get his plates?

24:00.917 --> 24:03.442
Damn.

24:05.052 --> 24:07.054
All right, how about 6:00
tomorrow? Can I get Inoki then?

24:09.360 --> 24:11.580
Yep, all right, I'll be there.

24:11.624 --> 24:13.016
Hey.

24:13.060 --> 24:14.453
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.193
How'd it go
with Sloane?

24:16.237 --> 24:18.195
Either he's a professional liar
or he's telling the truth.

24:18.239 --> 24:19.893
Which is...

24:19.936 --> 24:21.242
Uber driver took him
to the Namaka Ale House

24:21.285 --> 24:22.504
where he met
a waitress.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.201
Allana.

24:24.245 --> 24:26.377
They started to date,
he thought it was the real deal,

24:26.421 --> 24:28.510
which is why he reported
her missing to HPD.

24:28.554 --> 24:30.077
Yeah? Was he compromised?

24:30.120 --> 24:32.862
One night he blacks out, thought
he had too much to drink.

24:32.906 --> 24:35.517
Ended up at home,
nothing out of place.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.519
He didn't connect the dots
until we did.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.869
This is espionage.

24:39.913 --> 24:42.437
What would you
like today?

24:42.481 --> 24:44.874
Hey, uh...

24:44.918 --> 24:47.398
Kalua pig, uh... manapua.

24:47.442 --> 24:49.923
And, uh, loco moco, yeah?
Extra gravy!

24:49.966 --> 24:51.141
- Shoots!
- You want anything?

24:51.185 --> 24:53.143
- Is that all for you?
- No.

24:53.187 --> 24:54.971
No, no, no, I-I've been here
for, like, two weeks,

24:55.015 --> 24:56.538
and I haven't paid
for a single coffee.

24:56.582 --> 24:59.410
So... thought I'd bring
some culture to the team.

24:59.454 --> 25:01.369
I'm pleading vegetarian
on this one.

25:01.412 --> 25:02.544
All right.

25:02.588 --> 25:05.416
You're order number 15.
Thanks, yeah?

25:05.460 --> 25:07.549
All right.

25:07.593 --> 25:10.073
You know, the things
we do for our kids.

25:10.117 --> 25:13.120
Hey, you're a good mom to give
up the finer things in lunch.

25:13.163 --> 25:15.557
My daughter would
agree with you.

25:15.601 --> 25:18.604
My son recently pretty much
sees me as a prison warden.

25:18.647 --> 25:20.519
Hey, it's hard being a mom.

25:20.562 --> 25:22.695
It's, uh, it's hard
being a son, too.

25:25.132 --> 25:27.003
This whole case goes
back to the bar.

25:27.047 --> 25:29.266
Someone there is using locals
to steal military secrets.

25:29.310 --> 25:31.181
And the only lead
we have is a name.

25:31.225 --> 25:32.618
Big Luna.

25:32.661 --> 25:36.143
Ooh, looks like our spy ring
didn't compromise Walters.

25:36.186 --> 25:38.362
His credentials
aren't being used

25:38.406 --> 25:41.148
at anomalous IP addresses
or multiple locations.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.629
Yeah, well, they spoofed the
hell out of Don Sloane's phone,

25:43.672 --> 25:46.588
cracked his passwords,
got specs

25:46.632 --> 25:49.069
on the jet, code revisions,
personnel lists.

25:49.112 --> 25:50.984
Hoping there's something
they didn't get.

25:51.027 --> 25:52.638
Just what they needed
from Walters,

25:52.681 --> 25:54.944
which is info on the unmanned
aerial capabilities.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.424
Basically like a user manual.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.600
Who on the personnel list
would have access?

25:58.644 --> 26:00.950
That's the irony.
The spies know.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.691
But we don't have access
to that intel

26:02.735 --> 26:05.172
unless DIA gives it
to us.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.956
So...

26:07.000 --> 26:08.654
time to practice
our apologies.

26:19.186 --> 26:21.275
Oh, look who's here.

26:21.318 --> 26:23.320
Did you come by
to clean up your mess

26:23.364 --> 26:26.193
and save your ass?
Or maybe take a swing at me?

26:26.236 --> 26:28.412
No, no, no, I, um...

26:28.456 --> 26:30.240
came to apologize.

26:30.284 --> 26:33.069
I was out of line
and put you in a jam.

26:33.113 --> 26:35.028
And it wasn't right

26:35.071 --> 26:37.334
or fair.

26:37.378 --> 26:39.989
And I'm sorry.

26:40.033 --> 26:43.514
♪ That I'm too young to know

26:45.647 --> 26:49.651
♪ I love you so...

26:49.695 --> 26:52.306
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
We-we can't do this again.

26:52.349 --> 26:55.309
Uh, yeah,
that's a horrible mistake.

26:55.352 --> 26:58.007
Well, I wouldn't say
horrible.

26:58.051 --> 27:01.097
I'm agreeing with you.

27:02.098 --> 27:06.407
♪ If we just wait a while

27:06.450 --> 27:09.149
♪ No tears for us

27:09.192 --> 27:11.542
No, that's okay.
I'm not thirsty.

27:11.586 --> 27:13.762
Why are you here?

27:13.806 --> 27:15.764
♪ And wear a smile...

27:15.808 --> 27:18.201
Commander Walters was murdered.

27:18.245 --> 27:19.725
So was the girl he was seeing.

27:19.768 --> 27:21.552
We think there's a spy ring
stealing intel

27:21.596 --> 27:25.121
on sixth-gen fighters.
We can catch 'em with your help.

27:25.165 --> 27:27.384
You want to know who else is
working on the project.

27:27.428 --> 27:28.690
I can get the info
through channels, but you can

27:28.734 --> 27:31.127
- get it faster.
- What's in it for me?

27:31.171 --> 27:33.477
Professionally speaking.

27:33.521 --> 27:35.175
Uh...

27:35.218 --> 27:37.220
do your job, stop the bad guys,

27:37.264 --> 27:39.570
general sense of satisfaction.

27:39.614 --> 27:41.268
Oh.

27:44.445 --> 27:47.143
You know, I...
I could use a drink.

27:47.187 --> 27:48.797
Yeah, I think you should go.

27:50.625 --> 27:53.236
And the list of names?

27:55.761 --> 27:58.589
These are
our most likely targets,

27:58.633 --> 28:00.504
all DOD contractors
and employees.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.245
Whistler came through,
but 20 names.

28:02.289 --> 28:04.117
- Any way to narrow it down?
- Sloane and Walters

28:04.160 --> 28:06.075
were single,
no dependents.

28:06.119 --> 28:09.209
From the list, eight are married
with families. Two others

28:09.252 --> 28:10.732
started dating each other
during the project.

28:10.776 --> 28:13.082
- That leaves ten.
- We need to find someone

28:13.126 --> 28:14.605
with access to the same
self-flying capabilities

28:14.649 --> 28:16.738
as Commander Walters.

28:16.782 --> 28:18.522
Charles Randolph.

28:18.566 --> 28:20.524
Chief designer
of the automated flying system.

28:20.568 --> 28:22.309
Been at Pearl on and off
for two years.

28:22.352 --> 28:24.441
- Relationship status?
- Separated.

28:24.485 --> 28:27.096
Seems to have been kind of mopey
until about two weeks ago.

28:27.140 --> 28:29.751
- He met a girl.
And according
to an email he sent

28:29.795 --> 28:31.579
from his work computer,
her name is Sally.

28:31.622 --> 28:32.841
Cocktail waitress.

28:32.885 --> 28:35.278
- At the Namaka Ale House?
- Yep.

28:35.322 --> 28:37.150
And there's an anonymous
IP address tracking

28:37.193 --> 28:39.413
Randolph's phone,
just like Don Sloane's.

28:39.456 --> 28:41.110
They're going
after him, too.

28:41.154 --> 28:42.590
They didn't get
what they wanted from Walters.

28:42.633 --> 28:44.592
So they need this piece,
or the rest of it's useless.

28:53.253 --> 28:55.342
According to his cell phone,
Randolph

28:55.385 --> 28:57.474
arrived at the Ale House
15 minutes ago.

28:58.649 --> 29:00.564
New Guy, you get in any trouble,

29:00.608 --> 29:02.653
just say, "I'm new
to the island," we'll come.

29:08.659 --> 29:10.705
Got eyes on Randolph.

29:12.576 --> 29:14.230
What you drinking?

29:14.274 --> 29:16.537
Hey, uh, Hirata Shochu
if you have it.

29:16.580 --> 29:19.322
New batch coming
- for the holidays.
- All right, uh...

29:19.366 --> 29:21.324
...green bottle,
green bottle's fine.

29:21.368 --> 29:22.673
Shochu?

29:22.717 --> 29:24.763
It's a local spirit
made with sweet potatoes.

29:24.806 --> 29:26.765
Nectar of the gods.

29:26.808 --> 29:29.550
Hey, Myra!

29:31.204 --> 29:32.771
Any action in there, Kai?

29:36.557 --> 29:38.472
It's all foreplay.

29:38.515 --> 29:40.909
Bartender's serving Randolph
off the menu, though.

29:40.953 --> 29:43.303
They could be dosing him,
like they did Don Sloane.

29:43.346 --> 29:44.739
I got something else.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.697
Dude at the bar
hasn't touched his drink.

29:46.741 --> 29:49.352
Busy watching Randolph
- and the girl.
"Dude?"

29:49.396 --> 29:50.832
Got anything more to help?

29:50.876 --> 29:52.573
Tattoo, parrot on the shoulder?

29:52.616 --> 29:54.836
Signed affidavit he's Big Luna?

29:54.880 --> 29:56.751
It's dead tonight,eh, bro?

29:56.795 --> 29:58.797
Where's the party?

29:58.840 --> 30:00.233
Hmm.

30:00.276 --> 30:02.191
Everywhere's
the same these days.

30:02.235 --> 30:03.540
Yeah, yeah.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.325
Man, there
used to be a...

30:05.368 --> 30:08.415
this, this-this joint,
Helena's, you know?

30:08.458 --> 30:10.286
It's barely a joint,
it's just a shack.

30:10.330 --> 30:11.897
They stay
on School Street.

30:11.940 --> 30:14.813
Yeah, yeah, that's right!

30:32.395 --> 30:34.615
Hey, uh...

30:34.658 --> 30:36.878
Which side of the road
was Helena's on?

30:36.922 --> 30:38.662
Was it...?
North, bro.

30:38.706 --> 30:40.882
Yeah, yeah.

30:40.926 --> 30:43.406
Randolph's in play.

30:43.450 --> 30:45.539
Being taken out back.
Dude's not a local.

30:45.582 --> 30:47.584
He's in on it.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.418
Where you going, huh?

30:55.462 --> 30:57.943
It's just, where,
where's the bathroom in here?

31:02.904 --> 31:04.993
Hey, I'm...

31:05.037 --> 31:06.777
I'm new to the island... Jesse, Lucy!

31:06.821 --> 31:08.605
You take the front,
I got the back.

31:30.323 --> 31:32.716
Federal agents!

31:35.894 --> 31:38.592
Randolph's upstairs!

31:41.725 --> 31:43.945
NCIS! Stop!

31:43.989 --> 31:46.034
Hey!
Let's go!

31:50.996 --> 31:53.476
<i>How'd you know he wasn't local?</i>

31:53.520 --> 31:55.870
I asked where Helena's was,
he said north.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.785
Real local would've
said <i>mauka.</i>

31:59.395 --> 32:00.919
Ernie, you got eyes
on his vehicle?

32:00.962 --> 32:02.833
Yeah, heading leeward
at the fork.

32:02.877 --> 32:05.924
- How far behind are we?
- Let's just say go faster.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.320
Federal agents, keep your hands
where I can see them!

32:11.364 --> 32:12.539
Hey! Got her!

32:24.420 --> 32:25.987
Damn!

32:26.031 --> 32:28.120
Remind me never
to piss you off, Lucy.

32:29.556 --> 32:30.992
Suspect turned off-road

32:31.036 --> 32:33.342
a quarter-mile ahead
of your position, slowing down.

32:33.386 --> 32:34.865
Guess he thinks he lost you.

32:34.909 --> 32:36.389
Kind of feels
like he did.

32:46.747 --> 32:49.010
All right,
daytime surveillance shows

32:49.054 --> 32:50.751
a structure 100 feet
from the coast.

32:50.794 --> 32:52.796
Might be hard to see.

32:54.450 --> 32:56.452
Not so hard.

33:05.722 --> 33:07.724
NCIS!

33:07.768 --> 33:09.161
Hands!

33:39.104 --> 33:41.019
That's it!

33:41.062 --> 33:43.021
You're out of road!

33:44.761 --> 33:45.980
Put your hands up

33:46.024 --> 33:48.461
and walk slowly
towards me.

33:53.727 --> 33:55.990
Hey! Hey, don't,
don't, don't!

34:00.168 --> 34:02.083
What the hell?!

34:02.127 --> 34:04.825
No! No! No! No!

34:07.523 --> 34:09.525
Really?!

35:14.808 --> 35:17.115
Trust me!

35:28.952 --> 35:31.172
Never turn your back
on the ocean.

35:31.216 --> 35:32.869
Noted.

35:32.913 --> 35:35.045
Uh...

35:35.089 --> 35:37.700
You kind of got us into this,
you got a way to get us out?

35:40.050 --> 35:42.183
Hey, hey!

35:42.227 --> 35:43.967
The Coasties aren't lying.

35:44.011 --> 35:45.839
They're always ready.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.764
This everything we recovered
from Big Luna's safe house?

35:57.807 --> 36:00.680
Hard drives smashed.
Files and photos burnt.

36:00.723 --> 36:03.204
Just the kind of puzzle
that gets my circulation going.

36:03.248 --> 36:05.206
Did find this.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.730
Dextroamphetamine.
100 milligrams per pill.

36:07.774 --> 36:10.255
Colored to look like our pilot's
vitamin supplements.

36:10.298 --> 36:12.605
Big Luna must have snuck it
into our pilot's house

36:12.648 --> 36:13.954
- to dose him.
- Mm-hmm.

36:13.997 --> 36:15.129
DNA on his knife
also matched what

36:15.173 --> 36:16.609
was under Noelani's fingernails.

36:16.652 --> 36:18.176
He killed her, too.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.090
So we-we still don't know
who he worked for

36:20.134 --> 36:22.180
or how much of the jet program
was compromised.

36:22.223 --> 36:24.573
Hey, speak for
yourself, New Guy.

36:24.617 --> 36:26.749
Bartender Myra claims
to be a victim,

36:26.793 --> 36:29.230
but she served spiked drinks,
led Randolph

36:29.274 --> 36:31.754
up into the room,
gave as good as she got

36:31.798 --> 36:33.843
on the stairs with Lucy... Did not.

36:33.887 --> 36:36.716
So I called a friend at
Commerce and Consumer Affairs,

36:36.759 --> 36:39.936
figured out who owns the
bar, contacted their bank

36:39.980 --> 36:41.286
about suspicious
money transfers.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.726
Did you time this
- for when she walked in?
- No.

36:46.769 --> 36:48.728
That's just clean living.

36:49.772 --> 36:51.600
That man forced me
to help him.

36:51.644 --> 36:53.298
Threatened my family!

36:53.341 --> 36:55.822
- You saved me!
- Compelling story, Myra.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.824
Just not accurate.

36:57.867 --> 36:59.608
The bar you work for is
owned by a company

36:59.652 --> 37:01.784
called the 'O Ahi Group.
Hawaiian LLC.

37:01.828 --> 37:04.178
Financed by a holding company
based in Beijing.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.006
Okay... It's a cover.

37:06.049 --> 37:08.138
For the Chinese Ministry
of State Security.

37:08.182 --> 37:10.315
Our theory is you were
born in Honolulu...

37:10.358 --> 37:12.621
but trained by MSS.

37:12.665 --> 37:14.275
I'd really think hard
about what to say next.

37:14.319 --> 37:15.972
Because my friend here...

37:16.016 --> 37:18.018
hates spies.

37:22.936 --> 37:25.243
Let's talk
about experimental jets.

37:35.688 --> 37:37.733
Ready... salute!

37:50.180 --> 37:52.400
Something you need,
Special Agent?

37:54.707 --> 37:56.404
Lieutenant Commander
Walters came to NCIS

37:56.448 --> 37:58.711
because he suspected
a spy ring.

37:58.754 --> 38:00.321
Wouldn't have been able
to stop it without him.

38:00.365 --> 38:02.410
Wanted to pay
my respects.

38:06.719 --> 38:08.329
I'm known
to be somewhat bullheaded.

38:08.373 --> 38:10.070
"Somewhat"?

38:10.113 --> 38:12.420
Okay... completely.

38:12.464 --> 38:15.858
But if my attitude was...
off-putting...

38:15.902 --> 38:18.948
You said I was jeopardizing
the careers of my entire team.

38:18.992 --> 38:21.081
You wouldn't even take my
call on Whistler's behalf.

38:21.124 --> 38:23.170
I'm passionate about my people.

38:23.213 --> 38:25.999
Tempers rise when you care.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.350
Is this you apologizing?

38:29.394 --> 38:31.352
Yes.

38:32.397 --> 38:34.137
Well, it's very uncomfortable.

38:36.270 --> 38:38.054
You did good work.

38:38.098 --> 38:41.057
Stopped the bad guys, protected
international security...

38:41.101 --> 38:43.843
and the honor of our pilot.

38:43.886 --> 38:46.280
Apology accepted.

38:57.857 --> 38:59.859
Hey, cuz.

38:59.902 --> 39:01.426
Aloha.

39:01.469 --> 39:03.732
Hello, hey.

39:03.776 --> 39:05.908
Hey, what's up?
Hey!

39:05.952 --> 39:07.910
- I was just about to talk stink.
- Hey, no.

39:07.954 --> 39:09.259
You better not have.
I was out saving the world.

39:09.303 --> 39:11.087
- Okay?
- Sure you were.

39:11.131 --> 39:12.828
Hi, pup.

39:12.872 --> 39:14.134
Oh.

39:16.092 --> 39:18.094
Hey, I can't stay too long,
so...

39:18.138 --> 39:20.096
Oh, whatever, brah.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.403
Hey.

39:22.447 --> 39:23.883
Hey!

39:23.926 --> 39:26.407
Who's this now?

39:26.451 --> 39:28.191
That's Inoki.

39:28.235 --> 39:30.019
Fresh out of quarantine.

39:30.063 --> 39:32.761
Ah, you're a fine
looking fella.

39:32.805 --> 39:34.284
Hey, he remind of, uh--

39:34.328 --> 39:35.938
Hachiko.
Yeah.

39:35.982 --> 39:37.505
Your mother loved that dog.

39:37.549 --> 39:40.813
Hey, I bet Inoki wouldn't
mind going for a long walk

39:40.856 --> 39:42.467
after two weeks
in the big house.

39:42.510 --> 39:44.860
Um...

39:48.516 --> 39:50.126
Yeah, yeah, he probably could.

39:50.170 --> 39:52.520
Yeah.
Hey.

39:52.564 --> 39:54.827
Listen, Kai.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.437
About the other day...

39:56.481 --> 39:58.134
Hey, Pop, we're, um...

39:58.178 --> 39:59.788
we're gonna have
a lot of time to talk

39:59.832 --> 40:01.355
about things,
okay, so, um,

40:01.399 --> 40:04.053
why don't you two get
to know each other?

40:04.097 --> 40:06.055
Yeah?

40:08.188 --> 40:11.539
Oh, Inoki, gonna
be <i>mauka</i> or <i>makai?</i>

40:11.583 --> 40:14.542
<i>Mauka</i> got more trees, but <i>
makai</i> got the mangroves.
