It was such a pleasant surprise
to hear from you after so long.

I am fine

00:54.807 --> 00:57.519
I am glad
that you are making a fresh start.

00:58.644 --> 00:59.729
There is an old saying

00:59.812 --> 01:03.066
that there are things
a man can only learn in a city.

01:04.025 --> 01:08.196
I have found this to be true.
But do not be distracted, my son.

01:10.031 --> 01:15.204
Focus on your studies. Your goals.
We will discuss both when you visit.

01:17.498 --> 01:21.876

[professor] "Justice is nothing else
than the interest of the stronger."

09:27.528 --> 09:30.239
Now, we all know
the Greeks loved symbols, right?

09:30.740 --> 09:32.742
They have since antiquity.

09:32.826 --> 09:37.162
So what, then, was the great symbol
of democracy in Plato's time?

09:38.664 --> 09:41.375
Uh, yes. Um... Barry.

09:45.504 --> 09:52.386
That's correct. The raised hand.
One man, one vote. All of it very public.

09:52.469 --> 09:55.890
But when you imagine those raised hands,
class, you have to remember,

09:55.974 --> 09:57.892
every one of them held a spear.

09:58.475 --> 10:00.311
That's what "majority rule" meant.

10:00.394 --> 10:01.520
So that begs the question,

10:01.605 --> 10:06.108
is governmental rule always supported
by the threat of violence?

10:07.234 --> 10:09.278
-[professor] Yes, Thad?
-It has to be.

10:09.361 --> 10:12.616
-Otherwise, what authority would it have?
-But, what about the will of the people?

10:13.365 --> 10:15.910
-Sure. The people with the most spears.
-[Barry] But there's more to it than that.

10:15.994 --> 10:21.165
I mean, we sacrifice some of our,
um, independence to a government

10:21.248 --> 10:22.751
in return for security.

10:22.834 --> 10:24.293
And a kind of collective wisdom.

10:24.376 --> 10:26.087
Security's just another word
for "the most spears."

10:26.170 --> 10:27.421
Every time there was a vote,

10:27.504 --> 10:31.467
the minority didn't count up the spears
and, uh, decide not to revolt.

10:32.509 --> 10:34.054
Once you make the deal
to have a government,

10:34.136 --> 10:36.640
that government takes on
another kind of authority.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.767
What, like a moral authority?

10:38.849 --> 10:41.560
-Well--
-So Ronald Reagan has moral authority?

10:41.644 --> 10:44.021
Of course he does!
He was elected in a landslide!

10:44.105 --> 10:46.650
Okay, if there's one thing
Ronald Reagan definitely does not have,

10:46.733 --> 10:47.776
it's moral authority.

10:47.859 --> 10:50.235
-Sure has a great head of hair, though.
-[students chuckle]

10:50.319 --> 10:52.113
[professor] Sorry, just kidding. Continue.

10:52.196 --> 10:53.614
[Barry] Let me put it like this--

10:53.697 --> 10:57.117
if the states had voted on slavery,
we would have lost the vote.

10:57.201 --> 10:58.452
So, yeah,

10:58.535 --> 11:02.539
at that point, moral authority kicks in
to, uh, defend the minority

11:02.623 --> 11:04.375
against the will of the people.

11:04.793 --> 11:05.960
And that's when the spears come out.

11:06.044 --> 11:08.504
Yeah, I watched the news last night too,
Barry.

11:08.587 --> 11:11.340
Jesse Jackson
said that thing about slavery.

11:11.423 --> 11:13.300
Yeah, he did. And he's right.

11:14.928 --> 11:17.429
Seriously? The guy
who hugged Yasser Arafat is right?

11:17.513 --> 11:19.181
One thing has nothing to do
with the other.

11:19.264 --> 11:21.558
All right, guys. Reel it back in.
Remember, Plato.

11:22.726 --> 11:24.228
[Thad] Can I ask a question, though?

11:25.771 --> 11:28.065
Why's everything
always gotta be about slavery?

to gain entrance to her dormitory.

13:21.845 --> 13:22.387

So I stopped at the establishment
on the corner for a morning beer,

13:26.433 --> 13:28.895

for a smoke.

13:28.978 --> 13:32.148

if possible?

13:32.232 --> 13:36.069
You know, this, this might sound crazy,
but just bear with me.

13:36.152 --> 13:39.404

might be some kind of, uh, correlation

13:39.488 --> 13:42.741
between your constantly buying alcohol
and, uh, cocaine

All her friends are burlesque dancers.

14:01.635 --> 14:03.972
I don't have to spell it out for you,
do I, Barry?

14:04.055 --> 14:09.269

stay here, and we go together around nine?

I'd go to a party on campus.

16:26.571 --> 16:29.491
You ain't gonna get too many more
of them now that I know you a lefty.

16:29.574 --> 16:31.660
You better counter
with what you got, man.

16:37.916 --> 16:40.711

16:44.798 --> 16:47.051
-Hey, come on, come on.
-You don't know me, homeboy.

16:47.135 --> 16:49.012
You touch me again,
I'll knock your fuckin' head off.

16:55.434 --> 16:56.226

Like flies on shit, baby.

17:06.987 --> 17:08.114
What's up?

17:15.454 --> 17:18.790
Well, Jack Kerouac went here,
know what I mean?

17:18.874 --> 17:23.087
Allen Ginsberg. Uh, Paul Robeson.
[stammers] Where are those guys now?

17:23.837 --> 17:27.300
Uh... Dead. Kerouac is, for sure.

17:27.382 --> 17:30.093
-Who is Paul Robeson again?
-Where is that scene?

17:30.177 --> 17:32.095
[stammers] 'Cause it seems
like it doesn't exist.

17:32.180 --> 17:34.890
Or, well,
maybe I'm just not cool enough to find it.

17:36.309 --> 17:39.395
C'mon, dude, you just--
we're new, you know? It takes time.

17:40.687 --> 17:41.855

17:54.452 --> 17:57.497

-Cool.

17:57.579 --> 17:59.915
-All right.
-I'll go get us some beers.

18:06.089 --> 18:08.508

-Well, there you go.
-I'm over it.

18:10.926 --> 18:13.345
So, uh, what are our options?

18:14.805 --> 18:16.224
-Rum and Coke?
-That's gross.

18:16.307 --> 18:17.475
-Or Jack.
-Gross.

18:18.058 --> 18:20.393
Well, not Jack.
It's an extremely cheap whiskey.

18:20.478 --> 18:21.562
[laughs]

18:21.645 --> 18:23.939
-I'll take one of those.
-Okay, sure.

-Three?
-Uh, sure. Yeah.

-Yeah.

-So, uh, where are you from?

20:02.413 --> 20:07.543

Really? What?
In front of all these people?

20:16.968 --> 20:19.388
I mean, you're very pretty,
and I'm flattered, but--

20:19.472 --> 20:22.098
-No, that's not I was trying to say--
-I'm just messing with you.

in another direction.

His family, his background,
what people expect of him.

isn't about learning.

25:04.380 --> 25:05.590
Training for what?

25:05.674 --> 25:06.759
To, uh...

25:07.592 --> 25:10.512
To want what you don't need,
and to leave who you are at the door.

25:11.513 --> 25:14.057
But we're supposed to leave who we are
at the door. That's the point.

25:14.140 --> 25:17.143
Well, some people can't leave
who they are at the door. I mean...

31:32.643 --> 31:34.938
[both chuckle]

31:58.045 --> 31:59.795
[indistinct chattering]

32:03.007 --> 32:04.842
[vendor] One dollar, here. One dollar.

32:09.805 --> 32:11.182
[man] Help the homeless.

32:34.830 --> 32:35.748
Uh, how much?

32:37.500 --> 32:38.961
That's two dollars.

32:41.879 --> 32:42.880
Here you go, brother.

32:44.174 --> 32:47.344
Ah, thank you, my brother.
And I envy you for that one.

32:48.886 --> 32:49.887
Why's that?

32:50.513 --> 32:52.432
'Cause you 'bout to read that
for the first time.

32:53.225 --> 32:55.978
After you finish, slide back by
and let me know how you liked it.

32:56.769 --> 32:58.105
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

32:59.522 --> 33:03.943
[indistinct chattering]

33:04.027 --> 33:05.070
Yo! Invisible!

33:06.321 --> 33:09.032
-What's up, Ali? [chuckles]
-Yo! You going by the courts today?

33:09.116 --> 33:12.827
Yo, this dude got the ill baby skyhook.
Like Magic.

33:12.910 --> 33:15.663
-Gonna try. You?
-For sure. Maybe 'round two.

33:15.746 --> 33:18.666
-Cool. I'll catch you there.
-All right then. Be easy, homeboy.

33:18.749 --> 33:19.542
Like Sunday morning.

33:19.625 --> 33:22.211
[preacher]
"Can the prey be taken from the mighty,

33:22.294 --> 33:24.422
or the captives of a tyrant rescued?"

33:25.382 --> 33:29.219
[preacher] Now what that means is,
can we, the Lost Tribe of Israel,

33:29.302 --> 33:33.931
reclaim what is rightfully ours
from the cave-dwelling white devils

33:34.016 --> 33:37.060
that raped our ancestors, stole our land,

33:37.143 --> 33:40.479
and dispersed the true children of God
across the globe?

33:41.731 --> 33:43.108
-Read!
-[woman] Hey!

33:43.191 --> 33:47.778
I ain't... no devil.
This is not the words of Jesus Christ.

33:47.862 --> 33:49.739
Shut your mouth, cave bitch!

33:50.740 --> 33:53.075
Yes, you are a cave bitch.

33:54.076 --> 33:57.997
Do you know... what Jesus Christ
called the white woman in the Bible?

33:58.789 --> 34:00.249
A female dog.

34:01.792 --> 34:03.544
And what is a female dog?

34:04.587 --> 34:06.464
Don't be afraid to say it, brother.
That's right.

34:07.048 --> 34:07.882
A bitch.

34:07.965 --> 34:10.342
That's what Jesus Christ called you
in the Bible.

34:10.427 --> 34:12.636
[Barry] How come you're using
a King James Bible?

34:13.763 --> 34:16.516
-What?
-[chuckles] Why that edition?

34:16.599 --> 34:18.518
[stammers] I thought King James
was a white devil.

34:21.395 --> 34:23.813
Here's King James right here.
Take a good look.

34:25.357 --> 34:27.777
He looks like Billy Dee Williams
if you'd ask me.

34:28.985 --> 34:30.071
If you say so, brother.

34:33.366 --> 34:34.742
Now, you might ask...

34:34.824 --> 34:38.954
How did the Lost Tribes of Israel
become lost? Well, I'll tell you.

34:39.038 --> 34:41.706
[club music playing]

34:41.791 --> 34:43.042
[Saleem] How about her?

34:43.833 --> 34:45.628
-No way.
-Why not?

34:46.420 --> 34:48.839
She's trying way too hard.
Zero self-esteem.

34:48.922 --> 34:52.469
-[Saleem] So she'd sleep with me.
-[Charlotte] Um, probably?

34:52.967 --> 34:58.474
-So that's a yes, then.
-No. Big time no.

34:58.558 --> 35:01.811
I don't think you understand the nature
of this conversation, Charlotte.

35:01.894 --> 35:04.021
I don't really think I want to.

35:06.191 --> 35:08.776
Looks like your boyfriend's off
on Pluto again.

35:09.693 --> 35:13.030
Um... Ground Control to Barry.

35:13.697 --> 35:15.324
Oh, sorry. I was, um...

35:16.576 --> 35:17.660
-I was thinking...
-[Charlotte] No.

35:17.743 --> 35:18.953
-[Barry] Nah.
-[Charlotte chuckles]

35:19.829 --> 35:22.457
-Hey, Will.
-Hi, guys. What's up?

35:22.541 --> 35:25.585
Hey, Willy. What's this?
Buy one, get two free?

35:26.378 --> 35:29.004
-[chuckles]
-[Barry] You wanna join us?

35:29.088 --> 35:31.090
Uh... No, thanks.

35:31.173 --> 35:33.425
I think we're gonna check out
the band downstairs.

35:33.509 --> 35:36.971
-Okay. Well, um, I'll see you around.
-Yeah. See you, man.

35:38.806 --> 35:42.227
So, what are you guys doing
for Thanksgiving? Hmm?

35:42.309 --> 35:45.896
Anybody here dig,
uh, turkey tikka masala?

35:46.314 --> 35:48.400
I'm going to Connecticut.

35:49.775 --> 35:51.652
You guys are welcome to come with me.

35:51.735 --> 35:53.238
You can meet the clown
my sister's marrying.

35:53.321 --> 35:56.115
Well, I love clowns.
Let's go to Connecticut, Barry.

35:56.199 --> 35:58.951
I'm, um... I'm allergic to Connecticut.

35:59.034 --> 36:02.289
I break out into these,
um, gross white hives.

36:02.371 --> 36:04.665
Uh-- Besides, I...

36:05.167 --> 36:07.210
I'm sure your, uh, family
would love you showing up

36:07.294 --> 36:08.794
with a Pakistani and a Black guy.

36:08.878 --> 36:10.422
Oh, well, you're not that black, Barry.

36:10.505 --> 36:12.089
-[scoffs]
-[Charlotte] No, seriously.

36:12.673 --> 36:13.883
They really wanna meet you.

36:13.966 --> 36:16.093
Uh, I wanna meet them too.

36:16.178 --> 36:19.889
But maybe we should do it
on a more neutral ground.

36:19.972 --> 36:21.974
Someplace with a lot of witnesses.

36:23.643 --> 36:25.811
I'm gonna go talk to that girl
with low self-esteem.

36:25.895 --> 36:28.315
Look, my parents are gonna love you.

36:28.398 --> 36:30.650
I'm sure some of their very best friends
are Black.

36:30.733 --> 36:32.319
They are, actually.

36:33.152 --> 36:35.487
-I was--
-I know what you were doing.

36:35.988 --> 36:40.075
The question is...
why you feel the need to do it.

36:41.911 --> 36:44.371
Look, I just really want
to spend Thanksgiving with you.

36:45.873 --> 36:48.251
Maybe we could do it here, a day early.

36:49.628 --> 36:51.421
And then, I can go
to Connecticut by myself

36:51.504 --> 36:52.464
if you don't wanna come with me.

36:53.339 --> 36:55.758
[stammers] I'd like that.

36:57.927 --> 36:59.429
[Saleem] ...from the campus.

36:59.512 --> 37:03.807
-They're students. I'm not... really old.
-[both chuckle]

37:03.891 --> 37:06.852
[professor]
Now, here we have, if you'd like,

37:06.936 --> 37:11.566
a basic epistemological principle
that we must bear in mind.

37:11.650 --> 37:14.818
A genuine knowledge
involves cognitive union

37:14.902 --> 37:18.948
and overcoming
our estrangement or alienation.

37:19.031 --> 37:23.328
And this applies, I suppose,
to all spheres of our knowledge.

37:23.411 --> 37:26.456
I sometimes argue
that, to be a good scientist...

37:26.539 --> 37:30.627
[helicopter whirring]

37:36.757 --> 37:43.138
[siren wailing]

38:19.592 --> 38:20.593
[exhales deeply]

39:38.337 --> 39:42.091
So, I'm a little worried about Saleem
being in charge of Thanksgiving.

39:42.174 --> 39:43.509
I mean, can he even cook?

39:44.968 --> 39:48.055
Everything about that man is a mystery,
including these ingredients.

39:48.138 --> 39:52.184
Uh, yeah, what is "ghee"? [chuckles]

39:53.352 --> 39:55.104
And, um... [clicks tongue]

39:55.187 --> 39:57.898
you may have gotten out
of Thanksgiving with my family,

39:57.981 --> 40:00.652
but that means I'm gonna have
to take you to my sister's wedding.

40:00.734 --> 40:03.237
-[Barry] Hmm...
-And you're gonna have fun.

40:05.615 --> 40:07.282
You know I'm gonna cause a scene
at that wedding.

40:07.366 --> 40:08.410
-Oh, really?
-Mm.

40:08.493 --> 40:11.036
Once folks get a load
of my moves on the dance floor...

40:11.120 --> 40:12.162
Be a miracle. [chuckles]

40:15.582 --> 40:16.917
-[Ann] Aloha!-[Ann] Aloha!
-Mom?

40:18.753 --> 40:21.464
-Surprise!
-[Saleem] Surprise!

40:21.548 --> 40:22.965
You're supposed to be in Jakarta.

40:23.048 --> 40:26.009
I had a conference in LA.
Oh, my word. And here I am!

40:26.093 --> 40:27.970
-Here she is!
-My beauty.

40:28.929 --> 40:29.930
Uh...

40:30.013 --> 40:32.307
[stammering] Uh... Mom.

40:33.183 --> 40:36.019
-Uh... This is, uh, Charlotte.
-Charlotte.

40:36.103 --> 40:38.481
Hello. Such a pleasure to meet you, Mrs.--

40:38.565 --> 40:41.609
Ann. Just Ann, honey.
It's nice to meet you, too.

40:41.693 --> 40:44.571
[slow music playing on radio]

40:46.113 --> 40:48.574
-Charlotte, some peas, please.
-Mm-hm.

40:49.241 --> 40:51.285
Barry, honey, do you have a salad bowl?

40:59.919 --> 41:03.380
-Does this work?
-How about a knife?

41:09.219 --> 41:10.513
How about this?

41:10.597 --> 41:14.851
-Not exactly Julia Child, huh?
-Well, Saleem's sort of a child.

41:14.934 --> 41:17.520
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're sort of a poopy-head.

41:18.437 --> 41:21.148
Is the atmosphere around here
always so intellectually charged?

41:21.231 --> 41:23.693
-Oh, yeah.
-Well, you know, as a feminist,

41:23.776 --> 41:27.489
I would never endorse this sort
of retrograde patriarchal paradigm

41:27.572 --> 41:30.658
that would paint you as a sort
of domesticating, civilizing presence

41:30.742 --> 41:32.952
-in this household.
-Oh, no. Of course not.

41:33.035 --> 41:35.788
But if I did, I would say
that you have got your hands full

41:35.872 --> 41:36.831
with these two knuckleheads.

41:36.915 --> 41:39.082
-[Charlotte chuckles]
-Damn, Barry.

41:39.166 --> 41:41.251
Your mom can talk some shit.

41:41.335 --> 41:42.795
[chuckles]

41:42.879 --> 41:45.507
[Charlotte] So, do we get to hear
some embarrassing stories

41:45.589 --> 41:46.673
about Barry or what?

41:48.133 --> 41:50.469
I'm sorry to be dull,
but I don't really have any.

41:50.553 --> 41:52.889
He was so easy.
Even his birth was easy.

41:52.972 --> 41:56.308
I was 19 at that time,
so that wasn't the easiest, and...

41:57.184 --> 41:59.854
Neither was his dad, but what can I say?

41:59.937 --> 42:01.188
He's my darling boy.

42:02.105 --> 42:04.191
[Charlotte]
What wasn't easy about his dad?

42:04.441 --> 42:06.109
Barry barely talks about him.

42:06.193 --> 42:10.364
All I know is that he's some kind
of high-up government official.

42:11.281 --> 42:12.366
I only met him once.

42:13.325 --> 42:15.662
He showed up in Hawaii
when I was ten and...

42:15.744 --> 42:17.287
tried to tell me how to live my life.

42:18.080 --> 42:20.583
That's not true.
He was around when you were little.

42:22.209 --> 42:24.712
He's a lovely man. We just
weren't well-suited for each other.

42:24.796 --> 42:26.589
-Hmm.
-[Barry] Hmm.

42:26.673 --> 42:30.802
Mm, 'cause he had another family
in Kenya, Mom. He lied to you.

42:30.885 --> 42:34.096
It's a little more complicated than that.
But we don't have to talk about it.

42:34.179 --> 42:36.849
Okay. She always defends him.

42:36.932 --> 42:37.599
You know what?

42:38.600 --> 42:39.810
He gave me you.

42:43.230 --> 42:45.900
But Barry must've had
some terrible haircuts, at least.

42:45.984 --> 42:48.527
This is true. I used to cut his hair.

42:48.611 --> 42:51.990
Mm. That's something
no white woman should do.

42:54.576 --> 42:55.785
Probably not.

43:01.123 --> 43:03.625
Your mom is awesome.

43:04.961 --> 43:07.672
Yeah, she's, uh... something, all right.

43:09.882 --> 43:11.926
No, seriously...

43:12.009 --> 43:16.054
How many girls from Kansas end up working
at the Ford Foundation in Indonesia?

43:17.015 --> 43:20.183
Well...
first, you marry an Indonesian guy.

43:20.267 --> 43:24.771
Then you... move to Indonesia
and, uh, realize you need a job.

43:27.692 --> 43:29.027
That's not fair.

43:31.236 --> 43:33.906
Yeah. No... no, it's not.

43:40.037 --> 43:41.997
What are you gonna do with her tomorrow?

43:42.665 --> 43:45.375
Most of the rest of the world
is having Thanksgiving.

43:47.919 --> 43:49.254
Yeah, well...

43:49.839 --> 43:51.758
I'm sure she'll have some ideas.

44:52.151 --> 44:53.945
Is something wrong, honey?

44:55.362 --> 44:56.948
No. I'm just thinking about the movie.

44:58.032 --> 44:59.408
About you and the movie.

45:02.160 --> 45:05.288
And what was it you loved so much?
When you first saw it, I mean.

45:07.374 --> 45:08.625
It was beautiful.

45:10.335 --> 45:11.837
It was so exotic.

45:13.089 --> 45:14.882
I'd never seen anything like it.

45:16.843 --> 45:17.844
Like Dad?

45:26.351 --> 45:29.604
-Your dad hasn't written, has he?
-Why?

45:33.275 --> 45:35.820
Well, he's fallen on hard times,
I'm afraid.

45:37.320 --> 45:38.280
What happened?

45:39.531 --> 45:42.576
You know, it's all second-hand,
but he's not working, and...

45:42.952 --> 45:44.996
When he's not working,
he has a tendency to drink.

45:48.166 --> 45:49.792
He invited me to visit.

45:51.543 --> 45:53.880
That is fantastic.

45:53.963 --> 45:55.965
Oh, honey,

47:11.082 --> 47:12.291
Don't do that.

47:14.042 --> 47:16.628
You know, every time
I open my mouth in class, it's like...

47:17.796 --> 47:20.632
I'm supposed to speak
on behalf of all Black people.

47:22.384 --> 47:24.303
Meanwhile, I, uh...

47:25.470 --> 47:27.181
I quit going
to Black Student Union meetings

47:27.264 --> 47:31.560
because [stammers]
I didn't feel like I belong there either.

47:38.483 --> 47:40.152
[sighs]

47:45.950 --> 47:47.952
The world is a big place, honey.

47:49.287 --> 47:50.829
You'll find your way.

48:01.173 --> 48:02.258
-[PJ] Oh.
-[man 1] Ooh.

48:02.341 --> 48:05.385
[PJ] Oh... Oh...

48:06.386 --> 48:07.470
Come on, now. Oh!

48:08.471 --> 48:09.472
Oh...

48:09.556 --> 48:12.767
Go up, big man! Go up.

48:14.936 --> 48:17.731
Come on, and let's see. Let's see.

48:20.817 --> 48:22.069
Uh-oh.

48:22.153 --> 48:23.528
-Oh!
-That's a good-ass turn.

48:23.612 --> 48:27.449
Ladies and gentlemen,
young Ralph Ellison in the house tonight!

48:27.532 --> 48:29.659
I know you can't see him.

48:29.743 --> 48:31.786
Uncover your eyes, he already invisible.

48:35.207 --> 48:36.541
-[PJ] Oh!
-[man 2] Oh!

48:36.625 --> 48:37.709
[PJ] Oh!

48:38.877 --> 48:39.711
[PJ] Oh, my goodness.

48:39.794 --> 48:41.129
[man 3]
That's what I'm talkin' about, baby!

48:41.713 --> 48:44.090
[PJ] That's the reason
they call him the Invisible Man.

48:44.175 --> 48:46.218
[Saleem urinating]

48:46.302 --> 48:47.929
[Saleem sighs] Okay.

48:48.887 --> 48:51.640
[sighs] Let me give you
some real-deal Saleem advice.

48:51.723 --> 48:54.143
You want to impress her parents?

48:54.225 --> 48:57.979
Order for her. Don't ask her
what she wants, just, um...

48:58.064 --> 49:02.525
[imitating Barry] I'll have the lobster
and a magnum of your finest champagne.

49:02.609 --> 49:07.406
And the lady will have, uh... a salad,
with a glass of water... with lemon.

49:07.489 --> 49:12.328
[in normal voice] Or... how about
whatever they ask you,

49:12.410 --> 49:16.081
you start every answer
with, um, "Shit, motherfucker."

49:16.581 --> 49:22.462
So... "Barry, New York must be
quite the change from Hawaii."

49:23.422 --> 49:26.133
"Shit, motherfucker, it sure is!"

49:26.716 --> 49:28.176
[Saleem chuckling]

49:28.259 --> 49:33.765
"[stammers] Have you started to think
about the summer yet, Barry?"

49:33.848 --> 49:39.521
"Shit, motherfucker. I'm considering
taking an internship at a law firm."

49:39.604 --> 49:41.398
These are, uh... They're all great ideas.

49:43.317 --> 49:45.319
-Damn it.
-Here, here. Let me.

49:45.403 --> 49:46.362
Yeah.

49:46.445 --> 49:50.074
You know, there's a lot about me
that you don't know, my brother.

49:50.156 --> 49:54.411
For example, I used to work at a bank
for almost two years.

49:55.412 --> 49:56.705
And I never, ever--

49:56.788 --> 49:57.914
Watch your chin.

49:57.998 --> 50:00.542
Robbed the place. There.

50:02.419 --> 50:06.339
-[grunts] Another beer for Daddy.
-Thanks.

50:50.091 --> 50:51.760
Would you hand me a towel, please?

50:53.887 --> 50:55.514
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

51:26.170 --> 51:28.755
-[Charlotte chuckling]
-[Kathy speaks indistinctly]

51:30.299 --> 51:32.218
[Charlotte] Oh, there he is.

51:32.301 --> 51:33.760
[chuckles]

51:36.347 --> 51:39.391
-Bill Baughman. Pleasure to meet you.
-Uh, Barry.

51:39.475 --> 51:41.893
-My wife, Kathy.
-It's so nice to meet you.

51:41.976 --> 51:44.020
-We've heard so much about you.
-It's a pleasure to meet you.

51:44.104 --> 51:45.105
[Kathy] Thank you.

51:47.065 --> 51:49.235
Barry, I feel we're at a little bit
of a disadvantage

51:49.318 --> 51:51.611
because Charlotte got to spend
the whole day with your mother

51:51.694 --> 51:53.197
and all we get with you is a dinner.

51:55.533 --> 51:58.410
Also, Barry's mother is way cooler
than you two could ever be.

51:58.494 --> 52:00.287
[Bill] Oh, I don't doubt it.

52:00.371 --> 52:02.747
Well, I'm prepared to make
the most of the time we do have.

52:03.331 --> 52:05.291
I mean, I'll eat two entrées,
if I have to.

52:05.375 --> 52:06.751
[Barry and Kathy chuckle]

52:07.627 --> 52:11.340
You, um... You know,
I have to admit, it's, um...

52:11.423 --> 52:13.675
It's kinda strange for me
to be at the Yale Club.

52:17.720 --> 52:18.847
I'm from a Harvard family.

52:18.930 --> 52:20.474
-[chuckles]
-Ha.

52:21.766 --> 52:24.270
-I didn't know that. [scoffs]
-That... makes two of us?

52:24.353 --> 52:27.981
Yes, sir. My, uh, father did
his Ph.D. in Economics there,

52:28.064 --> 52:30.234
on a full scholarship,
as a matter of fact.

52:30.317 --> 52:32.819
-Well, he must be brilliant.
-Oh, he is something.

52:33.612 --> 52:35.239
I mean, Dad was born in Kenya.

52:35.822 --> 52:37.115
And he and my mother met

52:37.199 --> 52:39.618
when he was studying
at the University of Hawaii.

52:39.701 --> 52:41.537
The program
that brought him over was, uh...

52:41.620 --> 52:43.705
was funded by the likes of, uh...

52:43.788 --> 52:46.916
Harry Belafonte and Sidney Poitier,
uh, and the Kennedys.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.003
How remarkable. And, uh, where is he now?

52:50.086 --> 52:52.214
Uh... Dad's back in Nairobi.

52:52.298 --> 52:55.634
[chuckles] I believe his title
is Senior Government Economist.

52:56.385 --> 52:58.470
-Hmm.
-[Kathy] Such a fascinating country.

52:58.554 --> 52:59.888
Are you able to visit often?

52:59.971 --> 53:02.474
I plan on going soon.
Well, as soon as, uh...

53:02.558 --> 53:05.186
Charlotte teaches me
a little more Swahili.

53:05.269 --> 53:09.190
Oh... after I finish teaching him
about New York City politics.

53:09.273 --> 53:12.234
-That could take a while.
-And some alcohol.

53:12.318 --> 53:15.904
Well, uh... I hear you're something
of a political organizer, Mr. Baughman.

53:15.987 --> 53:19.032
Oh, no. I wouldn't say that.

53:19.991 --> 53:24.455
I've arranged bail for some organizers.
Represented the unions for years.

53:24.538 --> 53:27.583
But nowadays, I spend more time
raising money for candidates.

53:27.665 --> 53:31.336
It's not something
I particularly enjoy, but...

53:32.337 --> 53:33.880
it's more important than ever.

53:33.963 --> 53:38.552
Pretty soon, our only real game plan
might be to outspend the bad guys.

53:38.636 --> 53:42.805
Oh, and, uh, hope all that money
doesn't turn everybody into bad guys. Hmm.

53:42.889 --> 53:45.643
-Something like that.
-[Charlotte] Oh, come on, Dad.

53:45.725 --> 53:47.269
I've seen those pictures of you

53:47.352 --> 53:49.979
and your ponytail
marching for civil rights.

53:50.480 --> 53:53.650
-Sure, but everybody did that.
-Oh, not everybody.

53:53.983 --> 53:57.695
Of course, not everybody.
But everybody we knew in our little...

53:58.071 --> 53:59.822
liberal enclave.

54:00.031 --> 54:01.659
So, how'd your, uh, parents...

54:01.741 --> 54:04.328
feel about your, uh, you know,
"little liberal enclave"?

54:06.454 --> 54:09.499
Mine... not so good. Bill's...

54:09.999 --> 54:11.459
Worse. [sighs]

54:11.543 --> 54:16.257
But, you know, without their support,
I don't know if I'd have had the courage

54:16.339 --> 54:18.424
to spend my career
fighting the good fight.

54:19.425 --> 54:21.427
I might've gone corporate. Who knows?

54:21.928 --> 54:24.222
Now, I've got a good friend
who's making that decision right now.

54:25.098 --> 54:28.226
He's from the Grant Houses,
if you, uh, know where those are.

54:29.687 --> 54:32.814
-No, I don't believe so. No.
-Harlem.

54:32.897 --> 54:36.192
It's one of the biggest
public housing projects in the city.

54:36.276 --> 54:40.905
Now, he says he, um, didn't make it
to Columbia not to earn money.

54:41.407 --> 54:43.325
Well, that's very understandable.

54:44.158 --> 54:48.414
Yeah. I don't know. It's, um...
I think he's gonna be miserable.

54:49.706 --> 54:50.623
Mm.

54:54.085 --> 54:56.588
But, hey... [chuckles] But what do I know?

54:57.171 --> 55:01.926
Aside from that fact
that these lamb chops sound amazing.

55:02.010 --> 55:04.471
[Bill] Mm, well, I couldn't agree more.

55:08.933 --> 55:13.314
-Can we give you a lift back to school?
-Uh, no, thanks. We're going downtown.

55:13.397 --> 55:17.693
-Oh, we are?
-Yes. You... need to dance.

56:00.736 --> 56:02.070
-You think--
-You think you need to teach me.

56:02.153 --> 56:03.946
-I need to teach you?
-[chuckles] Are you kidding?

56:04.030 --> 56:05.990
-That girl was positively afraid of you.
-I wasn't...

56:06.074 --> 56:09.160
Hey, good evening
to you two lovely lovebirds.

56:09.243 --> 56:10.286
Y'all had a good night?

56:10.371 --> 56:11.413
-Mm-hm.
-Great night.

56:12.038 --> 56:13.247
You got a square, college?

56:13.749 --> 56:17.210
-Uh, it's my last one, boss.
-Come on, give me a bust-down, then.

56:17.502 --> 56:18.169
Okay.

56:22.048 --> 56:26.512
Keep it. One of these days,
I'ma make you buy me a pack.

56:26.594 --> 56:28.930
-[Charlotte chuckles]
-[Milton] Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

56:29.431 --> 56:30.973
What you just try to say to my mans?

56:31.766 --> 56:33.059
You gonna make him?

56:33.435 --> 56:35.019
-Who the fuck is you, nigga?
-[bottle shatters]

56:35.103 --> 56:36.354
Coño! Relax, Milton!

56:36.438 --> 56:38.482
[Milton] Now, who the fuck said
you could walk down my block?

56:38.565 --> 56:40.859
Yo! This kid is cool, Milt.

56:40.942 --> 56:42.318
-Chill out, bro.
-He don't look cool to me.

56:42.402 --> 56:45.238
-Nigga look like a motherfuckin' pussy.
-Man, I live here.

56:46.615 --> 56:49.283
Fuck you. You... ain't from here.

56:49.367 --> 56:52.203
[stammers] I didn't say I was from here.
I said I live here, okay?

56:52.286 --> 56:54.205
-One forty-two.
-I'm from here!

56:54.706 --> 56:58.669
-You understand? Born and bred.
-Okay, that's great.

56:58.752 --> 57:01.254
-Good for you.
-The fuck is you're walking away from me?

57:01.337 --> 57:02.798
-What you gonna do now, nigga?
-Yo, yo!

57:02.880 --> 57:05.633
Yo, Milt! Chill out, man.
Yo, put that away!

57:06.717 --> 57:08.886
Yo! Mira, don't do some shit
you gonna regret!

57:15.059 --> 57:16.644
Go on, man.

57:27.865 --> 57:29.407
[sighs]

57:31.951 --> 57:33.953
Where are you taking me?

57:34.913 --> 57:35.831
Oh...

57:37.290 --> 57:39.417
Hey, brother, you got
some of that, uh, Egyptian Musk?

57:39.501 --> 57:41.795
-[reggae music playing]
-Incense or oil?

57:41.879 --> 57:43.547
-[Barry] Uh, oil.
-[sniffs]

57:43.630 --> 57:47.216
-One, three, five.
-I'll take a three.

57:51.889 --> 57:54.432
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

57:57.853 --> 57:58.854
You like that?

57:59.855 --> 58:02.483
Hmm.
That reminds me of my friend, Idris.

58:02.565 --> 58:04.275
He always used to wear Egyptian Musk.

58:05.193 --> 58:09.572
Hey, uh, try this. It's called Black Love.
Drives the sisters crazy.

58:10.281 --> 58:11.575
[stammers] I'm good, thanks.

58:13.242 --> 58:16.037
-Who's Idris?
-From junior year abroad?

58:16.538 --> 58:18.957
-He goes to Emory.
-Right.

58:23.921 --> 58:27.549
[indistinct chattering]

58:29.593 --> 58:30.594
[man] Good day, Miss Lady.

58:30.677 --> 58:32.178
-Hello.
-How are you?

58:33.304 --> 58:36.140
Hey, my man. Good to see you.

58:36.224 --> 58:38.602
How did you like that Du Bois
I hit you with?

58:38.685 --> 58:41.020
Deep. What else you got for me?

58:41.103 --> 58:44.315
Let me see here.
I think I know just what you need.

58:44.858 --> 58:47.653
-How about this? Ralph. Invisible Man.
-I already read it.

58:47.736 --> 58:50.363
Oh. I'm impressed.

58:50.446 --> 58:52.866
-You know, he lives not far from here.
-Oh, yeah?

58:52.950 --> 58:56.452
Yeah. We've been waiting
on a sequel for a long time.

58:56.537 --> 58:58.705
Maybe he said everything he needed to.

58:58.789 --> 59:01.667
He might've dropped a little too much
truth for them in this one, baby.

59:01.750 --> 59:05.003
Oh, I love this book. Have you read this?

59:05.086 --> 59:07.548
Ah, you got good taste, Miss Lady.
James Baldwin.

59:07.631 --> 59:08.799
-Thank you.
-No, I haven't.

59:10.132 --> 59:13.135
-I'm buying it for you, then. How much?
-[man clicks tongue]

59:13.219 --> 59:16.640
-Um, that's on me.
-Thank you.

59:16.723 --> 59:17.891
-That's so sweet.
-My pleasure. Yeah.

59:18.474 --> 59:19.559
You guys enjoy your day.

59:26.567 --> 59:27.483
No, thank you.

59:27.567 --> 59:28.859
[preacher shouting indistinctly]

59:30.654 --> 59:33.072
Hey, can we have lunch at Sylvia's?

59:33.907 --> 59:36.868
-Where is that?
-You've never been to Sylvia's?

59:36.952 --> 59:39.287
No, Charlotte.
[stammers] I've never been to Sylvia's.

59:39.370 --> 59:41.414
Trust me, you're gonna love it.
It's right over there.

59:41.497 --> 59:44.542
-[preacher] Men far away. And there...
-Yeah. Sylvia's it is.

59:44.626 --> 59:47.295
-...in the midst of this land.
-[reader] And he cursed Canaan.

59:47.378 --> 59:50.423
-[man chuckling]
-[chattering]

59:50.506 --> 59:54.928
-Ten bucks for a plate of fried chicken?
-It's so good, though.

59:55.012 --> 59:56.429
I guess these people don't mind.

59:56.512 --> 01:00:00.141
In here stuffing their faces
while folks panhandle right outside.

01:00:01.225 --> 01:00:05.187
-That's any restaurant.
-M&G, six blocks away.

01:00:05.271 --> 01:00:07.356
Same menu, it's four bucks a plate.

01:00:09.817 --> 01:00:11.360
Are you mad at me or something?

01:00:13.237 --> 01:00:15.114
Have you noticed
you're the only white person in here?

01:00:16.449 --> 01:00:18.576
No, I'm not.

01:00:19.745 --> 01:00:23.790
-And besides, why does that matter?
-Nobody's looking at you.

01:00:24.373 --> 01:00:25.875
They're looking at me.

01:00:26.668 --> 01:00:31.130
Uh, the brother with the...
uh... white girl on his arm.

01:00:33.090 --> 01:00:33.924
Who?

01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:38.763
Who? Who, Barry?

01:00:40.641 --> 01:00:41.642
You don't see it.

01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:42.809
-So show me.
-I can't.

01:00:45.311 --> 01:00:46.937
[scoffs] You're not used to being visible.

01:00:48.689 --> 01:00:49.231
"Visible"?

01:00:51.693 --> 01:00:54.320
I'm a woman.
You think I don't get stares? Catcalls?

01:00:54.403 --> 01:00:56.405
-[stammers] That's not what I mean.
-And besides,

01:00:56.489 --> 01:00:58.867
I thought the whole problem
was being invisible.

01:01:02.953 --> 01:01:03.913
[waitress] You all ready to order?

01:01:18.053 --> 01:01:19.220
You wanna come up?

01:01:20.471 --> 01:01:23.557
No, I have...
I think I'm gonna go play some ball.

01:01:25.768 --> 01:01:27.561
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

01:01:29.605 --> 01:01:31.942
-Call me later?
-Yeah, I will.

01:01:38.406 --> 01:01:39.365
Um...

01:01:46.414 --> 01:01:47.623
I love you.

01:01:54.881 --> 01:01:55.799
Thank you.

01:02:05.142 --> 01:02:07.643
[man] Uh... Brick.

01:02:07.727 --> 01:02:09.311
[all laugh]

01:02:11.815 --> 01:02:14.067
Hey, yo, Invis,
you should come out with us tonight.

01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:15.776
What's on the agenda?

01:02:16.277 --> 01:02:20.364
-Your girl Tisha's having a thing.
-Tisha? Really?

01:02:21.199 --> 01:02:24.493
You don't need to be taking Invis
to nobody ghetto-ass house party.

01:02:24.577 --> 01:02:26.328
-Why not?
-Why not?

01:02:26.412 --> 01:02:27.956
[both laugh]

01:02:28.039 --> 01:02:31.584
Hey. This motherfucker's from Indonesia
and Hawaii and shit, man.

01:02:31.667 --> 01:02:33.128
You know what them niggas like, bro.

01:02:33.211 --> 01:02:35.296
-Take him to a luau or somethin'.
-[all laugh]

01:02:35.379 --> 01:02:38.133
How's a brother supposed to get culture?

01:02:38.216 --> 01:02:39.592
Y'all serious?

01:02:43.471 --> 01:02:46.557
Whatever. Maybe y'all see, man.

01:02:47.809 --> 01:02:49.060
[PJ] Oh--

01:02:49.144 --> 01:02:51.312
-[all] Oh!
-[all laugh]

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.817
"Thank you"?
What are you, Han Solo or some shit?

01:02:55.901 --> 01:02:58.736
Han didn't say "thank you."
He said, uh, "I know."

01:03:00.279 --> 01:03:02.991
'Cause that's the coolest way to say it.
Sure.

01:03:03.867 --> 01:03:05.243
I fucked up, huh?

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:08.662
Well, if you love the sister, you did.

01:03:10.791 --> 01:03:12.374
Why would she say it, then?

01:03:12.458 --> 01:03:14.919
After the worst two hours
of our whole relationship?

01:03:15.002 --> 01:03:16.045
[PJ] Hmm.

01:03:16.129 --> 01:03:20.050
Let me think. That's exactly why.
Look...

01:03:21.092 --> 01:03:25.429
If she says it to you again,
you either gotta say it back or walk off.

01:03:26.555 --> 01:03:27.933
[man] There he is.

01:03:31.727 --> 01:03:34.438
-[PJ] My man.
-[man] It's about time.

01:03:34.522 --> 01:03:36.233
[man] Thirsty?

01:03:36.315 --> 01:03:38.609
-Hell, yeah.
-Let's crack these babies.

01:03:39.277 --> 01:03:40.528
-[man mimics fizzing sound]
-[Barry] What's up, man?

01:03:40.611 --> 01:03:41.863
[man] All right.

01:03:41.946 --> 01:03:42.988
[beer cans opening]

01:03:43.072 --> 01:03:43.948
[man] Ooh.

01:03:46.952 --> 01:03:48.661
That's good.

01:03:48.744 --> 01:03:50.288
Look alive, Invisible.

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:55.459
And welcome to this episode
of "Project Safari."

01:03:56.837 --> 01:04:00.673
Now, in the projects-- Excuse us, ladies.

01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:04.302
In the projects,
the elevators go out all the time.

01:04:04.385 --> 01:04:06.679
Now, if you're somebody
like my man, Mr. Jim here--

01:04:06.762 --> 01:04:08.098
-How you doin', Mr. Jim?
-How you doin', boy?

01:04:08.181 --> 01:04:11.642
Or if I'm some old lady with grocery bags

01:04:11.725 --> 01:04:14.687
and I'm trying to get all the way up
to the tenth floor, you're wondering...

01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:18.399
-how do you get up there?
-You ask a nice young man for help.

01:04:19.859 --> 01:04:21.902
[all laughing]

01:04:23.404 --> 01:04:24.530
If you can find one.

01:04:24.613 --> 01:04:27.909
Hell, you sit your ass down on a bench
and wait for them to fix them shits.

01:04:27.993 --> 01:04:29.202
Hell, yeah.

01:04:30.578 --> 01:04:33.206
All right, now. Right through here,

01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:36.084
we have what you call
the "pissy staircase."

01:04:36.166 --> 01:04:37.418
For obvious reasons.

01:04:37.501 --> 01:04:40.212
I'm sure one of your five senses
has picked up as to why.

01:04:40.297 --> 01:04:42.715
Now, I would advise you
not to touch nothin'

01:04:42.798 --> 01:04:44.466
'cause you could get
the itchies and scratchies.

01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:45.969
It's hard to get rid of that.

01:04:46.635 --> 01:04:47.761
So...

01:04:49.096 --> 01:04:51.140
You wanna see some more,
you wanna go to the party?

01:04:51.223 --> 01:04:52.016
What you wanna do?

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.727
-More.
-More?

01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:57.146
Come on, man, I got ladies waiting for me.

01:04:57.813 --> 01:05:00.149
You know damn well
ain't nobody waiting on you.

01:05:00.733 --> 01:05:03.027
[chuckles] He lying.
Come on, we'll see y'all later.

01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:05.988
Come on, B. Right this way. Now...

01:05:06.864 --> 01:05:10.242
The projects ain't all fun and games.
Matter of fact, far from it.

01:05:10.576 --> 01:05:12.912
But you do gotta keep
a sense of adventure.

01:05:13.371 --> 01:05:14.830
That's why police hate coming up here

01:05:14.915 --> 01:05:17.334
because you'll never know
what's behind door number one,

01:05:17.416 --> 01:05:19.377
behind door number two...

01:05:20.794 --> 01:05:24.632
Matter of fact, you...
you know what a "shooting gallery" is, B?

01:05:27.426 --> 01:05:29.553
Well, take a look
behind door number three.

01:05:30.804 --> 01:05:32.182
It ain't for guns.

01:05:40.273 --> 01:05:42.150
Then you got motherfuckers like me.

01:05:43.692 --> 01:05:48.073
Same environment, same everything.
And what the fuck, right?

01:05:49.698 --> 01:05:53.119
But, I guess life is what you make it.

01:05:54.912 --> 01:05:57.873
One thing to remember, though,
through all of this.

01:05:59.583 --> 01:06:01.127
This is government housing.

01:06:02.836 --> 01:06:04.755
This is how the government
does our people.

01:06:09.344 --> 01:06:14.099
So, this concludes our episode
of "Project Safari."

01:06:14.182 --> 01:06:18.269
I've been your host,
and I need another beer.

01:06:21.356 --> 01:06:23.691
This one is gone. Excuse us.

01:06:25.235 --> 01:06:26.403
Right this way.

01:06:26.485 --> 01:06:29.197
[Ahzz's "New York's Movin'" playing]

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.824
[PJ] All right!

01:06:31.907 --> 01:06:35.078
How you doing? You look amazing.

01:06:48.799 --> 01:06:50.051
So, what you think?

01:06:50.592 --> 01:06:51.677
[stammers]

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.761
It's beautiful.

01:06:53.345 --> 01:06:55.889
[PJ laughs]

01:06:55.973 --> 01:06:59.310
Whatever you say, B.
Enjoy yourself, though.

01:07:03.148 --> 01:07:04.857
-[Lila] Hey.
-Hey.

01:07:06.484 --> 01:07:08.902
-How you doin', PJ?
-I'm good, Ms. Denise.

01:07:08.986 --> 01:07:12.032
-I'm fair for a square. How you doing?
-Good.

01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:24.294
Yo, Invisible! Come over here,
come over here, come over here.

01:07:26.254 --> 01:07:28.756
I got some people I want you to meet.
This is my girl Tisha, this is her crib.

01:07:28.839 --> 01:07:30.508
-Barry.
-Welcome, yeah.

01:07:30.591 --> 01:07:33.344
[PJ] This is Lila. Keep your hands off.

01:07:34.595 --> 01:07:36.097
And Ms. Denise.

01:07:36.181 --> 01:07:39.808
-Barry. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

01:07:41.852 --> 01:07:43.771
Mm. Nice.

01:07:45.689 --> 01:07:46.690
Wanna dance?

01:07:47.608 --> 01:07:48.776
Sure.

01:08:23.519 --> 01:08:26.188
So... where are you from?

01:08:27.773 --> 01:08:31.151
I live on 109th and Amsterdam. You?

[Taana Gardner's "Heartbeat" plays]

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:36.740
-Heaven?

01:08:38.535 --> 01:08:40.077
Eighth floor.

01:08:56.635 --> 01:08:58.178
What's living on the eighth floor like?

01:08:58.513 --> 01:09:02.099
[laughs] Well,
it's pretty much exactly like this.

01:09:02.183 --> 01:09:03.560
Why, you wanna see it?

01:09:04.685 --> 01:09:05.978
Uh...

01:09:06.937 --> 01:09:08.439
I wanna see everything.

01:09:09.857 --> 01:09:15.069
-So... why do they call you "Invisible"?
-It's because I'm spying.

01:09:15.154 --> 01:09:17.656
I probably shouldn't have told you that,
but I'm getting a good vibe.

01:09:17.738 --> 01:09:18.948
[giggles]

01:09:19.032 --> 01:09:21.327
-You seem trustworthy.
-Who do you work for?

01:09:21.411 --> 01:09:22.578
I'm freelance.

01:09:22.661 --> 01:09:26.457
Sometimes I spy
just for my own, um, edification.

01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:28.834
[giggles]
I think that's called a Peeping Tom.

01:09:28.917 --> 01:09:30.252
Mm-hm.

01:09:30.336 --> 01:09:31.629
Oh, shit!

01:09:34.299 --> 01:09:37.009
-What the fuck, Reggie?
-That's my girl you talkin' slick to.

01:09:37.091 --> 01:09:38.219
-Why are you over here?
-Who is he?

01:09:38.301 --> 01:09:39.136
-That's my friend.
-Who is he?

01:09:42.139 --> 01:09:44.057
-Yes.
-Oh, yeah?

01:09:46.143 --> 01:09:47.604
I love truth, man.

01:09:58.489 --> 01:10:01.242

-What happened to your face, B?

-Some asshole hit me.
-I'll get some ice.

Here, use this. It's cold.

That was supposed to be for your face.

-I gotta go.
-No, you don't gotta go.

01:10:29.895 --> 01:10:31.689
-Sit down.
-Nah.

-You giving me a problem?

-We got a problem here?
-Well, I don't see you ID'ing them.

-[Thad] Hey! Hey, it's cool.

are you trying to get arrested or what?

-Somebody punched it.

01:15:17.808 --> 01:15:21.394
At a party. In Harlem.
Your favorite place.

01:15:25.733 --> 01:15:27.108
I'm going to clean you up.

01:16:04.396 --> 01:16:05.397
-Here.
-Don't.

01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:09.401
Stop.

01:16:16.074 --> 01:16:17.409
What's the matter with you?

01:16:20.787 --> 01:16:22.372
Why do you like me, Charlotte?

01:16:27.294 --> 01:16:28.295
What do you mean?

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:33.758
-I like you 'cause I like you.
-No. Really.

01:16:34.759 --> 01:16:35.927
Why do you like me?

01:16:37.929 --> 01:16:39.598
Who wouldn't like that guy?

01:16:42.309 --> 01:16:43.894
That's not me, Charlotte.

01:16:45.312 --> 01:16:46.563
It was a joke.

01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:54.779
Just because you went to Kenya
for five days,

01:16:55.655 --> 01:16:58.617
doesn't mean you understand who I am.

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:04.956
[Charlotte sighs]

01:17:10.045 --> 01:17:11.796
You know what your problem is, Barry?

01:17:12.213 --> 01:17:15.300
You think that this... is all about you.

01:17:19.596 --> 01:17:20.681
Good night.

01:17:49.043 --> 01:17:52.295
-[Will] What happened to your face?
-I don't wanna talk about it.

01:17:59.679 --> 01:18:01.972
Man, listen, um...

01:18:02.056 --> 01:18:06.518
one of the guys at Robbie's suite
just moved out, so...

01:18:06.601 --> 01:18:08.062
there's a room open.

01:18:11.398 --> 01:18:14.150
-You should take it.
-Are you sure? I...

01:18:14.484 --> 01:18:16.361
I know you can afford the rent
by yourself.

01:18:16.444 --> 01:18:18.781
-I just thought--
-I'm ready for a change anyway.

01:18:18.864 --> 01:18:20.074
Yeah.

01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:22.158
No, I...

01:18:22.785 --> 01:18:24.161
I can move in with Saleem.

01:18:27.455 --> 01:18:30.417
I just feel isolated from campus,
you know?

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.003
It's cool, Will. I get it.

01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:42.512
-We'll still hang out, right?
-Yeah. Of course.

01:18:46.516 --> 01:18:48.643
[Bobby Womack's

01:20:57.438 --> 01:21:01.109
[dogs barking]

01:21:12.288 --> 01:21:14.789
[phone ringing]

01:21:38.605 --> 01:21:40.398
[Saleem] Barry, my brother.

01:21:41.482 --> 01:21:43.443
We live in a shithole, you know that?

01:21:44.485 --> 01:21:47.156
I mean, an actual place for shitting.

01:21:48.198 --> 01:21:50.200
All afternoon, I am watching

01:21:50.283 --> 01:21:52.911
white people bring their dogs here
to shit.

01:21:53.913 --> 01:21:57.624
And they just walk away. [chuckles]
They just leave the shit.

01:21:57.707 --> 01:21:59.709
[dog barking]

01:21:59.792 --> 01:22:02.296
Look, look, here comes another one now.

01:22:02.379 --> 01:22:06.674
Hey! Clean up after your filthy animal,
you filthy animal!

01:22:07.717 --> 01:22:10.387
Bedtime for Saleem. Come on. Come on.

01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:11.804
Come on.

01:22:15.017 --> 01:22:16.851
I like that girl Charlotte, Barry.

01:22:16.935 --> 01:22:18.353
[Saleem chuckles softly]

01:22:18.436 --> 01:22:20.772
[stammers] She called a bit earlier.

01:22:22.649 --> 01:22:25.443
She said she was gonna pick you up
at noon for the wedding.

01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:28.571
[Saleem coughing and groaning]

01:22:29.447 --> 01:22:30.865
-Hey, Barry?
-Yeah?

01:22:32.533 --> 01:22:34.577
You're becoming a real bore.

01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:43.337
[phone ringing]

01:22:56.015 --> 01:22:56.891
[groans]

01:23:09.989 --> 01:23:13.325
-Hello?
-[woman] Barry? Is that you?

01:23:13.409 --> 01:23:15.285
Yes. Who's this?

01:23:15.369 --> 01:23:18.913
Yes, Barry, this is your Aunt Jane,
in Nairobi.

01:23:18.997 --> 01:23:20.164
Can you hear me?

01:23:20.248 --> 01:23:23.418
Uh, barely. I'm sorry, my aunt who?

01:23:23.501 --> 01:23:25.461
[Aunt Jane] Aunt Jane.

01:23:26.171 --> 01:23:31.135
Listen, Barry, your father is dead.
He is killed in a car accident.

01:23:32.885 --> 01:23:37.099
Hello? Can you hear me?
I said your father is dead.

01:23:37.182 --> 01:23:39.976
Please call your uncle in Boston
and tell him.

01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:44.440
I cannot talk now, okay, Barry?
I will try to call you again.

01:23:44.522 --> 01:23:45.440

01:24:08.921 --> 01:24:10.923
[sirens wailing]

01:24:13.801 --> 01:24:19.058
Okay, so, don't laugh, but I'm thinking
of taking a job on Wall Street.

01:24:21.559 --> 01:24:26.105
Daddy's got some friends.
I'm just sick of being broke, man.

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:29.151
It's getting lame. What do you think?

01:24:34.989 --> 01:24:36.115
Oh, that's it?

01:24:36.532 --> 01:24:40.703
No "you'll fit in great with the rest
of those cokehead assholes"?

01:24:40.953 --> 01:24:45.209
No "if you actually stood for anything,
I'd call you a sellout"?

01:24:48.753 --> 01:24:51.964
Ah, you're becoming a real bore,
have I mentioned that?

01:25:04.936 --> 01:25:06.687
[Charlotte] It's like musical chairs or--

01:25:06.771 --> 01:25:12.528
I mean, you turn 25, the music stops,
and whoever you're dating, you marry?

01:25:13.945 --> 01:25:17.073
It's not just my sister, either.
It's all of her friends--

01:25:17.157 --> 01:25:19.535
I don't see them for a few months,
and then, bam,

01:25:19.617 --> 01:25:23.037
they show up with rocks on their fingers
and some random guy in tow.

01:25:23.122 --> 01:25:26.375
And it's like, "Wow, what a coincidence."

01:25:26.458 --> 01:25:28.042
You all just happened
to meet your soulmates

01:25:28.126 --> 01:25:29.919
within six months of each other?

01:25:31.171 --> 01:25:32.381
What are the odds?"

01:25:38.845 --> 01:25:39.637
Hey.

01:25:43.475 --> 01:25:44.934
You feel really far away.

01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.811
Sorry.

01:25:54.026 --> 01:25:55.362
Not what I meant.

01:26:01.868 --> 01:26:03.786
Do you hate weddings or something?

01:26:05.455 --> 01:26:06.956
No, I've never even been to a wedding,

01:26:09.083 --> 01:26:10.419
except for my mother's.

01:26:12.670 --> 01:26:14.381
Well, would you ever want to get married?

01:26:17.842 --> 01:26:21.137
I don't mean now.
I don't even mean to me.

01:26:21.221 --> 01:26:25.642
I just mean... is it something
you could see yourself doing someday?

01:26:27.059 --> 01:26:30.730
No, it's, uh, not an institution
I put much faith in.

01:26:32.399 --> 01:26:36.027
I mean, my parents were married five times
between them. Or six.

01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:37.862
And I'm not even sure about my father.

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:47.663
Well... are you nervous
about meeting my family?

01:26:53.085 --> 01:26:54.962
-Why? Do I look nervous to you?
-No.

01:27:00.510 --> 01:27:02.011
You look like you're going into battle.

01:27:23.115 --> 01:27:24.618
[photographer] All right, big smiles!

01:27:26.369 --> 01:27:28.788
Now, hold it! Hold it!
One more. Just one more.

01:27:30.248 --> 01:27:31.040
Come on.

01:27:33.293 --> 01:27:35.379
Great. All right, all the fellas.

01:27:36.087 --> 01:27:38.756
Yeah, Barry, come. Come join us.

-You stand with Martin, here.
-[woman] Hello.

Hey, George.

01:27:45.137 --> 01:27:47.139
There's the man.

01:27:47.223 --> 01:27:50.810
-Yep, okay.
-It's kind of an uptight crowd, huh?

01:27:51.394 --> 01:27:52.687
I'm kind of an uptight guy.

01:27:57.024 --> 01:27:59.443
Great! Now all the ladies.

01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:17.629
[photographer] Ready?

01:28:20.423 --> 01:28:23.843
[Ephraim] It's the second time this week.
The second.

01:28:24.344 --> 01:28:27.972
Listen, you have to take it easy.
You know they're not like back home.

01:28:30.725 --> 01:28:31.517
Hello, sir.

01:28:32.893 --> 01:28:37.649
-Can I get you something?
-No, no. I'm just, um, I'm killing time.

01:28:52.706 --> 01:28:53.914
How you guys doing today?

01:28:55.249 --> 01:28:56.208
Fine, sir.

01:28:59.504 --> 01:29:01.757
-My name's Barry.
-Fred.

01:29:02.799 --> 01:29:03.966
Ephraim.

01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:13.976
-Where you guys from?
-We are Ugandan.

01:29:15.144 --> 01:29:16.604
I thought so.

01:29:17.855 --> 01:29:20.232
My, uh... father is from Kenya.

01:29:20.316 --> 01:29:22.026
Ah! [chuckles]

01:29:23.319 --> 01:29:24.571
Here you go.

01:29:24.653 --> 01:29:25.780
Yeah. He...

01:29:27.031 --> 01:29:28.324
He died recently.

01:29:29.493 --> 01:29:32.161
My condolences to you and to your family.

01:29:32.244 --> 01:29:33.372
Mine as well.

01:29:34.997 --> 01:29:36.207
Yeah, thanks.

01:29:38.502 --> 01:29:39.960
Yeah. It was today, actually.

01:29:40.670 --> 01:29:41.505
[glass clinks]

01:29:41.587 --> 01:29:42.213
I, uh...

01:29:43.715 --> 01:29:48.010
I got a phone call this morning
from, uh, from an aunt I never met.

01:29:57.561 --> 01:30:01.732
Actually, you know what?
[stammers] I will have a drink.

01:30:04.861 --> 01:30:08.573
-What do you got back there?
-It's a full bar, sir.

01:30:10.741 --> 01:30:11.617
I'll have a...

01:30:12.744 --> 01:30:14.078
I'll have a vodka.

01:30:38.686 --> 01:30:39.270
Cheers.

01:30:50.239 --> 01:30:52.576
-How you doing?
-[chuckles]

01:31:02.334 --> 01:31:04.796
-Yeah, this is my boyfriend, Barry.
-[man] Oh, hi.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.506
-Barry.
-Good to meet you.

01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:09.300
-Barry, this is Donna.
-Barry.

01:31:09.383 --> 01:31:11.302
-Ted.
-Barry.

01:31:11.385 --> 01:31:12.970
-And Emily.
-Pleasure.

01:31:13.722 --> 01:31:17.183
-Oh, and this is my cousin, Melissa.
-Barry.

01:31:18.142 --> 01:31:19.310
Hey.

01:31:20.227 --> 01:31:23.439
Barry, there's someone
I'm dying to introduce you to.

01:31:23.523 --> 01:31:25.274
-Just when I thought I'd met everyone.
-Hmm.

01:31:40.372 --> 01:31:43.710
Barry, meet James and Grace Lee.

01:31:43.793 --> 01:31:47.296
Two of the most brilliant,
committed writers and activists

01:31:47.379 --> 01:31:49.883
-I have ever had the pleasure to know.
-Well, I'm honored to meet you.

01:31:50.675 --> 01:31:54.679
Grace Lee tried to convince Malcolm X
to run for Senate in '64.

01:31:54.763 --> 01:31:57.139
-It almost worked, too.
-[Barry] Wow.

01:31:57.807 --> 01:32:00.727
I thought you might want to meet them.
Especially because of your parents.

01:32:05.524 --> 01:32:06.650
[James] Have a seat, Barry.

01:32:09.945 --> 01:32:11.153
Are your parents in the movement?

01:32:11.237 --> 01:32:13.239
Uh, no. Not really.

01:32:13.781 --> 01:32:17.409
They're, uh, different races.
I'm guessing that's what Kathy meant.

01:32:18.410 --> 01:32:20.412
Ah, I see.

01:32:21.455 --> 01:32:26.502
[stammers] My mom's from Kansas,
and my dad's from Kenya.

01:32:28.755 --> 01:32:30.549
I've only met him once, though.

01:32:31.758 --> 01:32:34.176
I grew up in Jakarta and Honolulu,

01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:38.765
and spent a little time in California,
then, well, I ended up here.

01:32:40.057 --> 01:32:41.308
That's some kinda gumbo.

01:32:41.392 --> 01:32:43.728
[James and Grace Lee chuckle]

01:32:44.771 --> 01:32:46.188
You know what that makes you,
young brother?

01:32:47.231 --> 01:32:49.734
No, sir. [stammers] I don't.

01:32:49.817 --> 01:32:51.944
I really, really don't.

01:32:53.279 --> 01:32:57.116
It makes you American.
And you don't ever have to choose.

01:33:03.205 --> 01:33:08.085
You know, I see you both
sitting here together, in love.

01:33:08.210 --> 01:33:09.086
[chuckles]

01:33:09.169 --> 01:33:11.171
-Yes, sir.
-And full of wisdom.

01:33:11.672 --> 01:33:13.549
And I can't help but think that...

01:33:14.258 --> 01:33:16.302
the two of you must have been
through all kinds of hell together.

01:33:16.385 --> 01:33:20.556
Doing what you've done.
And looking how you look.

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:23.434
You take the baton
from the ones who've come before,

01:33:23.517 --> 01:33:25.769
and you carry it as far as you can.

01:33:26.228 --> 01:33:27.605
And then you hand it off.

01:33:28.939 --> 01:33:31.442
That's life. A beautiful struggle.

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.279
[Nina Simone's "I Will Be Released"
playing]

01:33:54.214 --> 01:33:55.257
Hey.

01:33:58.094 --> 01:33:59.303
Dance with me.

01:36:57.648 --> 01:36:58.732
[Barry] "Dear Dad,

01:37:00.068 --> 01:37:02.862
I am sorry it has taken me so long
to write you back.

01:37:04.363 --> 01:37:06.950
I have thought of you
and your invitation to visit every day.

01:37:07.909 --> 01:37:10.744
Sometimes I feel
that there's a part of me I do not know,

01:37:12.663 --> 01:37:14.249
and when I am feeling optimistic,

01:37:14.331 --> 01:37:16.918
I find myself believing that you hold
the answers I am looking for.

01:37:19.086 --> 01:37:21.839
My journey so far has not been
as dramatic as yours,

01:37:22.256 --> 01:37:25.509
but I'd like to think I can imagine
what you felt when you arrived in Hawaii.

01:37:26.261 --> 01:37:28.637
Perhaps even what you felt
when you met Mom.

01:37:30.556 --> 01:37:34.393
I suppose I have spent these last months
in New York trying to find my way.

01:37:34.768 --> 01:37:36.770
Maybe that is all any of us do.

01:37:38.438 --> 01:37:40.649
I look forward to discussing
these things with you, Dad.
