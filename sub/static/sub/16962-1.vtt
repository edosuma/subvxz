01:35.428 --> 01:37.396
You know what happens
at that height?

01:39.766 --> 01:42.064
The brain dies
from lack of oxygen.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.730
Cell by cell.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.405
It just shuts down.
And the body goes with it.

01:51.444 --> 01:54.413
I can't stop thinking about
what it must have been like.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.288
Why don't you start at the beginning?
It's always the easiest.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.621
Okay.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.964
I'll start at the beginning.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.161
I grew up on the plains
in Indiana.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.164
I was a flatlander through
and through.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.160
To be honest, I really
didn't have much to leave behind.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.172
Virtually no family and
very few friends.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.835
Anyway, it was January.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.175
I'd already been in London,
a year and a half...

03:34.214 --> 03:37.183
For the first six months,
I'd been incredibly lonely.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.511
Then I met Jake.

03:43.890 --> 03:47.519
What I loved the most was how
comfortable we were with each other.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.189
I felt safe.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.540
Okay, let's go.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.878
I design CD-ROMs and web sites
for corporate clients.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.214
- That must pay well.
- I sound fancier than it is.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.122
Jake was an engineer.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.557
Tunnels and bridges,
that sort of thing.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.898
He kept his tube tickets in a wallet
he got when he was twelve.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.227
Same wallet.
Same inside pocket.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.071
Alice?

04:35.775 --> 04:37.402
I'll see you later.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.150
- Hey, Alice. You going in?
- Yeah.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.004
- I'll see you in a minute.
- Okay.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.375
Reconfigure the training
program manual...

06:57.750 --> 07:00.719
...to make it look like
a game on the web site.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.714
We tried that with
the Appliance Kings.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.389
Yeah, this isn't about
washing machines.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.388
Now we're training
a worldwide sales force.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.960
You're the new media pioneers.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.731
Think of something.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.404
Alice, you still have
the old template, don't you?

07:23.443 --> 07:25.411
Are you with us, Alice?

07:40.626 --> 07:43.254
I'm going out to get my hair trimmed.
I'll be back after lunch.

08:05.818 --> 08:06.785
Shoot!

08:28.508 --> 08:30.806
- And you got in?
- Yeah.

08:32.511 --> 08:33.979
I got in.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.692
- What's your name?
- Alice.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.998
Don't turn away.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.011
Come here tomorrow.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.347
I have to work.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.695
Then, come back tonight.

12:10.396 --> 12:11.693
I can't.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.530
Whenever you want, Alice.
You decide...

12:21.240 --> 12:23.538
...and I'll be here.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.549
I couldn't believe what
had happened that day.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.890
I knew it shouldn't
happen again.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.227
I wanted everything back
the way it was.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.403
What do you want me to do?

13:01.113 --> 13:03.411
Nothing. Just keep doing
what you're doing.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.467
That's when I found out
his name.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.803
Adam Tallis.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.472
And that he climbed mountains.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.978
He caused quite a stir here yesterday.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.651
He saved six people
up there.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.313
No oxygen.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.536
- You stop me whenever you want.
- Please, don't stop.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.879
Please, don't stop.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.556
I bought your book today.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.559
It isn't my book.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.887
I'm just in it.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.557
It looks good.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.234
People died, Alice.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.579
Something went very wrong.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.589
There was a woman
named Françoise Colet.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.269
I lost her whole group.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.939
I still don't understand what happened.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.943
There was no room for error.
Everything had been checked.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.779
I was in love with her.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.123
Do you know what it's like
over twenty thousand feet?

16:44.503 --> 16:46.130
It's like this.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.803
Without air,
the brain cells die.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.137
It shuts down.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.142
And then the rest
of the body follows.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.653
It has been two years...

17:09.361 --> 17:11.329
...and it doesn't go away.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.000
I live with someone.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.014
But you're here.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.677
I have to go.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.019
No.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.027
Don't put them on.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.044
- Hello?
- Hi. Where are you?

18:08.754 --> 18:10.278
I'm running some errands.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.289
Ah. Do you think you can pick up
my watch on the way home?

18:13.425 --> 18:16.053
- I'm running behind schedule.
- Of course I can.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.390
I missed you today, Alice.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.566
Miss you.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.069
- I love you.
- Love you.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.748
Knock it! Knock... Nice!

18:46.125 --> 18:47.592
And give it!

18:49.461 --> 18:51.088
What are you doing?!

19:08.480 --> 19:10.778
Oh God, ref.
That's a bit harsh.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.782
- Jake?
- Yeah, sorry, I'm just...

19:19.158 --> 19:21.456
Oh, there's nobody there!

19:22.161 --> 19:24.129
Jake, I have to leave you.

19:24.496 --> 19:27.124
- You what?
- I can't go on like this. I'm sorry.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.468
I have to leave.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.474
You have, you have to leave me?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.815
Alice...

19:51.190 --> 19:53.158
...we're together.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.827
We're perfect together.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.824
I wanna marry you.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.497
I met somebody.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.184
Who?
Who did you meet?

20:19.551 --> 20:21.178
You don't know him.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.349
- I'm sorry.
- When did you meet him?

20:25.724 --> 20:28.591
I didn't mean to hurt you.
It's not the point.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.695
It's very much the point!

20:31.063 --> 20:33.031
We go to the market together
every Sunday.

20:33.398 --> 20:36.026
I buy your fucking
tube tickets for you!

20:37.736 --> 20:39.033
Jesus!

20:47.079 --> 20:48.706
Where are you going?

21:15.107 --> 21:18.076
You were looking for Adam?
He's not here at the moment.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.742
It's cold out there, come in.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.075
Please, come in.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.926
I've been climbing in Chile.

21:36.628 --> 21:39.597
Adam always takes
these pictures down.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.268
Or makes sure his back
is turned to them.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.931
Oh, please, sit down.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.606
For me, pictures
tell me who I am.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.606
But for Adam,
they steal his soul.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.946
- Want some?
- No, thank you.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.948
- No, it's quite good.
- No.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.958
Oh, I'm his sister.

22:07.659 --> 22:10.628
- You're his sister?
- Yep. I'm Deborah.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.965
We climb together a lot.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.964
He was having some work done
on his place, so...

22:17.336 --> 22:19.964
...he stayed here while
I was gone.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.637
This...

22:23.342 --> 22:25.310
...is Mr. Know-It-AII.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.649
It's his name.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.985
This is Françoise, right?

22:38.690 --> 22:41.318
That's the real reason my brother
takes the pictures down.

22:42.027 --> 22:45.656
Because it's... it's too hard
for him to see her.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.665
My brother's a brave guy,
but sometimes...

22:53.372 --> 22:55.340
...he's afraid of remembering.

22:59.878 --> 23:03.837
What he forgets is that he's not
the only one responsible.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.517
I was up there too.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.851
She was my best friend, Alice.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.860
Yes, I know your name.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.865
You're very beautiful.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.877
I can see why he'd fall
so hard for you.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.546
The thing about my brother...

23:43.922 --> 23:46.220
...is you're either with him
or you're not.

23:47.592 --> 23:51.221
And once you've made the jump
and you're with him, that's it.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.557
There's no discussion.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.899
Can I have his address?

24:02.274 --> 24:03.901
Yes, of course.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.248
Thank you.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.652
I left him.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.998
You're hurting me.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.869
Adam?

26:26.918 --> 26:28.215
Morning.

26:29.921 --> 26:32.219
Alice, this is Joanna.
Joanna, Alice.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.896
Joanna Noble from
"The Guardian".

26:39.264 --> 26:41.892
I'm interviewing Adam about
his Himalayan clean-up project.

26:42.934 --> 26:44.561
Nice to meet you.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.902
Where can I find a shirt?

27:24.643 --> 27:25.610
Adam?

27:26.311 --> 27:28.609
- Your phone.
- Could you get that for me?

27:36.988 --> 27:38.615
No one there.

27:40.659 --> 27:44.288
And it’s just become a playground
for the rich and inexperienced.

27:53.004 --> 27:54.528
I have to go to work.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.470
- Will you think about me today?
- Yes.

27:56.841 --> 27:59.139
- What are you doing today?
- Thinking about you.

28:01.179 --> 28:03.477
- Do you want to learn how to climb?
- Sure.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.814
- Come and see me after work.
- Okay.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.368
He's good.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.538
He's not as strong as he was
last week tough.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.372
Ah, he'll get there.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.878
- Hi.
- It's great to see you.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.443
I see you've got a harness.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.112
- Do you want to put it on?
- I guess.

29:18.256 --> 29:22.556
Just put your feet in there and
pull it like a pair of trousers.

29:27.265 --> 29:28.892
That's great.

29:34.105 --> 29:37.404
That's right, double back
and look, there we go.

29:38.109 --> 29:39.736
- It suits you.
- Thank you.

29:47.118 --> 29:48.642
It's okay. I'm helping her.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.755
Hi. How are you?

29:52.123 --> 29:53.750
I'm sorry.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.093
- Let me check your harness.
- Okay.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.425
Seems to be good.

30:05.136 --> 30:08.105
She's my sister, but she drives me
mad. I swear it's chemical.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.106
- Are you ready?
- Well, no. Maybe.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.613
Well, finally, Alice.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.280
The flatlander who captured
the mountain boy.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.283
Alice, meet Klaus.
Klaus, Alice.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.285
I liked your book.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.621
Well, thank you.

30:33.998 --> 30:35.625
Well, nice to meet you.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.472
This looks hard.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.800
It's all in the mind.

31:03.528 --> 31:06.053
I mean, my taste in clothes
has completely changed.

31:06.197 --> 31:09.496
I bought this practically
transparent pink T-shirt.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.833
And I won't even tell you
about the lingerie.

31:13.204 --> 31:17.504
No, it's probably best. I'm still in
the big white cotton panties.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.845
I'm sorry, I'm a little maniac.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.842
Have you seen Jake?

31:27.218 --> 31:29.846
Course I have, he's been
my friend for fifteen years.

31:30.989 --> 31:32.422
How is he?

31:32.557 --> 31:35.856
He's smoking like a fiend
and he's completely fucked up.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.863
It's not like there's
no reason, is there?

31:41.232 --> 31:42.529
Sorry.

31:47.238 --> 31:50.207
I think that you're destroying
both of your lives.

31:52.243 --> 31:53.870
I'm sorry.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.880
You had somebody
who loved you.

32:00.585 --> 32:04.544
You loved each other and
you let him go for good sex.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.558
Love isn’t just a good fuck, you know.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.894
- This is more.
- More what?

32:10.261 --> 32:13.230
More everything. When I'm with him,
everything is more.

32:13.598 --> 32:16.897
Oh, God! You could write greeting
cards, you really bloody could.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.071
I'm sorry.

32:27.445 --> 32:29.072
Right.

32:31.783 --> 32:35.651
Let's get out of here. I could do with
some retail therapy myself I think.

32:35.787 --> 32:39.086
I can't. I'm gonna see Adam at three
o'clock and you can meet him.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.985
I've been spending way too much
money and I saw this dress...

32:45.129 --> 32:47.757
...and it was in this really
amazing store.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.095
Really?

32:54.639 --> 32:56.937
- Give it here. Come on.
- Oh my God, Alice!

33:01.980 --> 33:03.607
It's okay, she's fine.

33:36.347 --> 33:37.974
Call the police.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.652
Adam! Stop!

33:42.353 --> 33:43.980
Stop!

33:55.033 --> 33:57.331
When I saw him...
Oh, Jesus.

33:58.703 --> 34:01.001
That'll never happen again.
I won't let it.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.232
Are you all right?

34:05.376 --> 34:06.843
Are you okay?

34:07.378 --> 34:09.346
- I'll always be here, Alice.
- Yeah.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.679
I'll protect you.
Say you believe me.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.518
I believe you.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.686
Marry me.

34:24.728 --> 34:26.356
Marry me.

34:28.399 --> 34:30.025
And soon.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.027
Tomorrow.

34:32.402 --> 34:34.701
The day after. As soon as possible.
Marry me.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.371
Yes.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.219
Sir, can we ask you
some questions, please?

35:18.449 --> 35:21.418
"Use your head, Alice. What do
you really know about him?"

35:29.127 --> 35:31.425
- Hey, you ready?
- Look at this.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.767
Someone is trying to scare you.

35:37.135 --> 35:40.104
There was another call this morning,
but they didn't say anything.

35:41.806 --> 35:43.330
It makes me sick.

35:43.474 --> 35:47.433
If anything else happens like this
again, make sure you tell me.

35:48.479 --> 35:49.776
- Okay?
- Okay.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.775
You'll be fine.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.205
Do you, Alice, promise to love
and cherish Adam...

36:25.349 --> 36:27.214
...for as long as
you both shall live?

36:27.351 --> 36:28.648
I do.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.319
And do you, Adam, promise
to love and cherish Alice...

36:32.690 --> 36:34.988
...for as long as
you both shall live?

36:35.359 --> 36:36.326
I do.

36:36.694 --> 36:40.653
May the Lord bless this union and
secure it from all harm.

37:04.555 --> 37:06.079
How do you know the priest?

37:06.224 --> 37:08.192
This is my family church.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.861
You have a family church?

37:11.562 --> 37:14.531
I have a mother that doesn't talk
to me and a dad I've never met.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.862
It doesn't matter. Our life began
when we first saw each other.

37:22.907 --> 37:25.205
- I need you to see something.
- What?

37:42.260 --> 37:43.784
No, no, no wait.

37:43.928 --> 37:47.227
Now I want you to see this through
my eyes when I was six.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.900
Look... like this.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.573
You know the story that
we're broken into two pieces...

38:01.946 --> 38:05.245
...and we spend our lives searching
for our other half?

38:08.619 --> 38:10.246
You're it.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.256
Okay, here we are.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.259
We're getting dressed here?

38:25.303 --> 38:26.770
Yep. Here.

38:48.159 --> 38:51.788
No, no, don't do that. I need
to remember you like this.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.313
Come on, before you freeze to death.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.315
Come on.

39:25.529 --> 39:26.826
Alice?

39:45.049 --> 39:47.677
This is the only way station
for hikers in the whole area.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.685
The church has kept supplies
up here for years.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.362
You went hiking
on your wedding day?

40:03.067 --> 40:05.695
It was his idea of romance.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.697
Adam.

40:11.075 --> 40:14.272
I thought that a honeymoon was
lying in bed with room service.

40:14.412 --> 40:18.041
Oh, I'll give you a honeymoon
you won't forget. I promise.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.385
No, no, no, sit down.
Sit down.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.715
Choose your rhythm and then
commit to following it.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.718
Count if you have to.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.900
I'm gonna make you strong.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.575
I wanted him
to be proud of me.

40:48.946 --> 40:51.244
So I followed
the trail for hours.

41:23.147 --> 41:24.444
Adam?

41:42.166 --> 41:43.793
You made it.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.972
- What's that?
- It's an anchor.

41:57.014 --> 41:58.982
To catch a falling body.

42:01.685 --> 42:02.982
Catch.

42:06.690 --> 42:08.658
Do you trust me?

42:19.036 --> 42:20.663
Don't move.

42:55.239 --> 42:57.207
I gave up all control.

42:57.575 --> 43:00.544
I let him decide when
I could breathe...

43:00.911 --> 43:02.879
...and when I couldn't.

43:03.914 --> 43:05.381
And I loved it.

43:56.967 --> 43:58.434
I love you.

43:58.969 --> 44:00.596
I love you. God, I love you!

44:12.650 --> 44:15.619
We returned to London and
Joanna Noble's article came out.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.623
I was happier than I'd ever been...

44:22.493 --> 44:23.790
Excuse me.

45:14.044 --> 45:15.511
Hello, Jake?

45:15.713 --> 45:18.682
No, it's Sylvie speaking.
Hello, Alice.

45:20.384 --> 45:22.352
I must have dialed wrong.
I thought I was calling Jake.

45:22.720 --> 45:26.019
Oh, no, no, that's fine. I just
happened to be over actually.

45:27.057 --> 45:28.684
Jake's gonna be back soon, I think.

45:29.059 --> 45:31.926
Look, Alice, this is gonna
sound a bit weird...

45:32.062 --> 45:34.030
...and I was definitely
gonna tell you but...

45:35.733 --> 45:38.361
...Jake and I have actually
been seeing each other.

45:39.069 --> 45:40.696
You and Jake?

45:41.739 --> 45:44.367
Well, it... it just sort of happened.

45:46.910 --> 45:48.537
Did you move in?

45:50.080 --> 45:52.048
Yeah, I did.
Sort of.

45:53.751 --> 45:55.218
Oh, God.

45:57.087 --> 45:58.952
How cliché is this?

45:59.089 --> 46:01.717
Old friend moves in to console
jilted boyfriend...

46:02.092 --> 46:04.390
...and then these two
find themselves together.

46:06.930 --> 46:08.557
Are you gonna be okay with this?

46:09.266 --> 46:10.790
Yeah, I'm okay.

46:10.934 --> 46:12.231
Alice...

46:12.936 --> 46:14.563
We're gonna be late. Hurry up.

46:15.272 --> 46:16.569
Alice?

46:17.274 --> 46:19.902
Yeah, I gotta go. We'll talk
about it later, okay?

46:40.631 --> 46:41.928
Here we go.

46:44.301 --> 46:46.929
Good evening.
Good evening, Adam.

46:51.809 --> 46:53.436
Hey, Alice. Alice, I'm sorry.

47:05.489 --> 47:07.116
Sorry.
Excuse me.

47:12.329 --> 47:14.627
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

48:10.721 --> 48:12.689
It's Alice Tallis.

48:14.057 --> 48:16.355
My rhyming sister-in-law.

48:18.228 --> 48:19.695
Are you okay?

48:19.830 --> 48:21.923
I have a headache and
I was looking for some aspirin.

48:22.065 --> 48:24.363
Oh, no, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

48:31.408 --> 48:33.706
- Can you feel that?
- Yeah, it really hurts.

48:35.078 --> 48:36.705
Close your eyes.

48:38.415 --> 48:39.712
Breathe.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.048
Slowly.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.230
That's good.

48:59.603 --> 49:01.901
It's a meridian that
controls the kidney...

49:02.272 --> 49:04.900
...or the brain
or the left big toe.

49:05.943 --> 49:07.570
I forget which.

49:09.279 --> 49:12.248
But it's whatever
works, right?

49:14.952 --> 49:15.919
Thank you.

49:16.453 --> 49:18.250
Close your eyes.

49:19.790 --> 49:21.417
Close your eyes.

49:24.795 --> 49:26.763
Okay, you can open.

49:27.464 --> 49:29.091
Oh my God!

49:30.801 --> 49:33.770
I want to drink to that beautiful
lady in blue. Where is she?

49:40.811 --> 49:43.439
I don't think she's ever climbed
past the third floor,

49:45.148 --> 49:47.116
but she has conquered our Adam.

49:48.485 --> 49:52.444
What she doesn't know is that
to get Adam she also gets us.

50:05.669 --> 50:07.637
Most of the people using
the program are women.

50:08.005 --> 50:10.530
And we tried to sell them a game.
But women don't like games.

50:10.674 --> 50:13.302
Women lime stories.
Men like games.

50:14.011 --> 50:15.979
Men like to slay the dragon
and get the princess.

50:16.346 --> 50:17.870
But women like
to know...

50:18.015 --> 50:20.313
...how the dragon and the princess
get in there in the first place.

50:22.686 --> 50:24.654
A game is the wrong approach.

50:30.694 --> 50:31.991
Sorry.

50:35.532 --> 50:36.897
Alice Tallis.

50:37.034 --> 50:39.332
This is Joanna Noble.
Do you remember me?

50:39.703 --> 50:41.227
Oh yes, I remember you.

50:41.371 --> 50:43.999
I got a weird note
about the article.

50:46.043 --> 50:49.672
I'm not gonna do anything with it.
I'm certainly not gonna follow it up.

50:50.714 --> 50:52.238
It's probably stupid of me...

50:52.382 --> 50:55.010
but I somehow felt obliged
to tell you about it.

50:57.054 --> 50:59.022
Shall I send it to you?

50:59.389 --> 51:01.016
Yeah, you can send it.

51:01.725 --> 51:03.352
Is it private?

51:04.061 --> 51:06.256
I don't want this sitting
in a public in-basket.

51:06.396 --> 51:09.365
- I understand. You can fax it.
- Okay. I'll do that.

51:09.733 --> 51:11.701
- You have the number?
- Yeah, I got it from your secretary.

51:11.835 --> 51:13.302
Okay, thanks for calling.

51:13.403 --> 51:15.030
Sorry, I had
to take that.

51:17.074 --> 51:19.702
No problem.
Gave me a chance to think.

51:21.078 --> 51:24.377
We shouldn't be playing games. It's
obvious. Women don't like games.

51:29.086 --> 51:30.713
I think this project needs
a new face.

51:31.088 --> 51:33.716
Dear Joanna Noble, what you wrote
made me sick.

51:34.091 --> 51:36.389
Your big hero, Adam Tallis,
raped me.

51:36.760 --> 51:39.058
Why don't you try reporting the truth?

51:42.265 --> 51:43.892
It's out of paper.

51:48.271 --> 51:50.239
I've decided that from now on...

51:50.941 --> 51:52.909
...this is Alice's project.

51:53.276 --> 51:54.903
You're the new point man.

51:55.278 --> 51:57.576
I mean, point girl.
Woman.

51:58.615 --> 51:59.912
Excellent.

52:05.956 --> 52:07.924
- Congratulations, Alice.
- Thank you.

52:13.296 --> 52:15.264
- Open or closed?
- Closed.

52:23.540 --> 52:25.508
Ligue para a vítima se quiser
a verdade: Michelle Stowe.

52:27.144 --> 52:28.111
Fuck!

52:36.987 --> 52:38.511
Alice Tallis' office.

52:38.655 --> 52:40.520
Hello. Claudia? It's Adam.

52:40.657 --> 52:42.955
- Oh, hi, Adam.
- Is Alice there?

52:43.326 --> 52:45.954
- No, she’s just left actually.
- Where did she go?

52:46.663 --> 52:48.290
I think she went to the doctor's.

53:00.677 --> 53:02.872
You thought this woman
was sending the notes.

53:03.013 --> 53:03.980
Yes.

53:24.868 --> 53:27.166
Hello, I'm Joanna Noble
from "The Guardian".

53:28.205 --> 53:30.833
I called you before.
Are you Michelle Stowe?

53:31.208 --> 53:32.835
Yeah, I am. Come in.

53:34.211 --> 53:35.838
I was having a birthday party.

53:38.215 --> 53:39.842
I asked him to dance...

53:40.550 --> 53:42.177
...and then... I don't know...

53:45.222 --> 53:46.849
...we started kissing.

53:48.225 --> 53:49.852
I was shit-faced.

53:52.229 --> 53:54.197
Think I even put
my hand in his shirt.

53:55.565 --> 53:57.192
Then we went outside.

54:03.406 --> 54:05.033
I guess the air must have
straightened me up,

54:07.077 --> 54:08.704
cos I remember wondering...

54:11.748 --> 54:13.375
...what the hell I was doing.

54:24.594 --> 54:26.221
Then he pulled me
into the bushes.

54:27.597 --> 54:29.224
Undid my dress.

54:30.600 --> 54:32.568
There was a zip.

54:33.270 --> 54:34.897
In the back.

54:41.278 --> 54:42.905
I was so young.

54:50.620 --> 54:52.247
I started to cry.

54:53.623 --> 54:55.921
He put his hand over my mouth
and kept going.

54:59.296 --> 55:01.924
He's strong.
There was nothing I could do.

55:04.801 --> 55:06.428
I tried to fight him.

55:12.142 --> 55:15.441
When he was done, he shook me
and said something like...

55:16.813 --> 55:21.113
"It's only sex, just sex."

55:22.819 --> 55:24.446
He got up...

55:25.488 --> 55:27.115
...and left the party with his sister.

55:36.666 --> 55:37.633
So...

55:38.501 --> 55:40.799
...you wanna write an article
about this, then?

55:41.838 --> 55:45.467
I mean, he's not royal or anything,
but he's close enough.

55:47.510 --> 55:49.478
We could make some money
out of this, Joanna.

55:56.853 --> 55:58.480
It doesn't work that way.

55:59.189 --> 56:02.158
Everybody's always blabbing about
who's sticking it into who.

56:05.362 --> 56:08.661
You have no proof. This is a question
of 'he said, she said'.

56:12.035 --> 56:14.003
Jesus, Alice.
I can't believe you did this.

56:14.704 --> 56:17.332
What if she calls my editor?
I could be fired.

56:18.375 --> 56:21.003
Do you think that nosy wives have
immunity from normal behavior?

56:21.378 --> 56:25.007
I knew the minute I called that
it was a mistake. I'm sorry, Alice.

56:26.716 --> 56:30.243
I thought you should know what I did.
It was really just innocent curiosity.

56:30.387 --> 56:34.016
It's never innocent.
Curiosity gets people killed.

56:36.059 --> 56:38.027
What would you do
if it was your husband?

56:38.395 --> 56:39.919
I don't have one.

56:40.063 --> 56:42.691
You not only have one, but one
who's wild about you.

56:46.069 --> 56:48.037
You're right.
I have to trust him.

57:15.198 --> 57:18.361
People have stories.
You and I... everyone.

57:20.303 --> 57:23.272
But
couldn't tell you one complete
story about my husband.

57:24.407 --> 57:29.174
Practically everything
knew about him
came from a book or a newspaper.

57:30.313 --> 57:33.180
Or shreds of information dropped
by other people.

57:34.217 --> 57:35.377
I couldn't help myself...

57:36.419 --> 57:38.284
I needed to know more.

58:07.383 --> 58:09.248
Adele Blanchard.

58:15.358 --> 58:18.225
It's crazy, but want to show
the world my bruises.

58:21.264 --> 58:23.232
What we're doing
is dangerous...

58:23.466 --> 58:25.434
...but still can't help
wanting more.

58:34.277 --> 58:36.245
The only way to end this
is to be brutal.

58:37.280 --> 58:39.339
We have to stop
what we're doing.

58:40.283 --> 58:42.251
I've decided to go back
to my husband.

58:43.386 --> 58:46.253
I'm not strong enough to live
on the edge with you any more.

58:47.290 --> 58:50.259
I know you won't fall,
but I will. I'm sure of it.

58:52.295 --> 58:55.355
This tears me apart, but
I have to go back to Michael.

58:57.300 --> 58:59.359
I love you... Adele.

01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:08.367
I've been thinking about you.

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:16.403
Me, too.

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:39.426
I called the office yesterday
looking for you.

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:41.394
Oh, yeah?

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:44.440
Claudia said you weren't feeling well,
thought you might be at the doctor's.

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:51.438
I... had an appointment but
I never got out of my meeting.

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.327
Where was the meeting?

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:10.366
At the client's hotel.

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:19.575
- Which hotel?
- The Hilton.

01:01:25.481 --> 01:01:27.346
I'm sorry for being nosy.

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:31.351
I just like to picture what you do
during the day.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.413
Where did you get this?

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:03.416
Deborah gave it to me.

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.424
She has good taste.

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:20.501
Adam?

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:24.438
I got a call about... a weird call
about the article.

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:28.544
And there was this woman
named Michelle Stowe.

01:02:28.678 --> 01:02:30.646
She sent a fax.

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:35.542
It didn't happen.
I never raped her.

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:38.647
I shouldn't have...

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.558
I've known her since
we were kids.

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:45.552
And think she saw me
as a way out.

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:49.465
If you'd met her, you'd understand.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.468
I'm not surprised
she contacted you.

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:58.572
I'm just sorry
you had to hear all that.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.588
- Hurry up. Are you ready?
- I'll just get my jacket.

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:14.581
Oh, hi, Alice.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.494
I'm sorry to barge in like that,

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.691
but your husband refuses to understand
that sponsors need talk shows.

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.603
And knew he'd only
show up if drove.

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:36.473
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna be on a talk show?

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:38.580
It’s just a stupid chat show.

01:03:42.718 --> 01:03:44.549
Bye, Alice.

01:04:13.716 --> 01:04:14.683
Shit!

01:05:41.837 --> 01:05:44.704
- Directory Inquiries?
- Yes... Adele Blanchard.

01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:47.709
- Which city, please?
- It's London.

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:50.710
Do you have a listing for Adele
Blanchard on Marchmont Road?

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:52.609
One moment.

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:38.751
- Yes?
- I'm looking for Adele Blanchard.

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:42.664
- I'm her mother.
- Is she home?

01:06:46.702 --> 01:06:48.727
You must be one
of her American friends.

01:06:48.804 --> 01:06:50.669
We tried to contact everyone.

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:57.804
She's been missing
for eight months.

01:06:59.648 --> 01:07:00.706
Missing?

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.715
What did you say your name was?

01:07:04.653 --> 01:07:05.813
Joanna.

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:08.714
She never tried to contact
her husband?

01:07:09.658 --> 01:07:11.683
Not even a letter to
an old boyfriend or something?

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:13.820
Eight months
and not a word.

01:07:15.664 --> 01:07:19.828
And this is from a daughter who manages
to e-mail her mother from Nepal.

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:30.644
Joanna, promise me you'll never
think the worst about Adele.

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:32.839
It helps a little if...

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:35.751
If one tries to be positive.

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:46.853
She was so happy that day.

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:49.762
No jitters. Nothing.

01:07:54.703 --> 01:07:55.863
Do you know him?

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:58.764
Adam Tallis.

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.869
She climbed all over the world
with him.

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:05.873
My son-in-law Michael is
a trader in Milan.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:11.785
At first he never stood in her way
when it came to climbing.

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:15.848
But after two years
he got fed up.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:18.792
It was either climbing
or the marriage.

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.794
She chose the marriage.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:26.697
The day before she was
supposed to go back to Milan...

01:08:28.837 --> 01:08:31.807
...she went out...
And never came back.

01:08:35.743 --> 01:08:36.904
I found that in her bags.

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:40.805
It's probably the last picture
taken of her.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:47.719
Today had two signs
that Adele is close by.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:50.926
You arrived.
And Adam called.

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:02.736
He wanted to know if there was
anything new in the investigation.

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:06.899
Would you like to stay for dinner?

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:09.843
No, thank you. Just have
to get home. It's really late.

01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:14.747
I'm disappointed.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.952
He should be here
around five.

01:09:20.788 --> 01:09:22.848
You and Adam
would love each other.

01:09:24.993 --> 01:09:26.962
Sit, sit.
I'll get it.

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:50.808
Oh, Joanna, do you really have
to go now? What a shame.

01:09:51.953 --> 01:09:53.819
I was hopping that
you would stay a little.

01:11:13.135 --> 01:11:14.830
Adam?

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:49.087
What are you doing?

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:51.126
I'm making you mine.

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:01.236
Sometimes feel like
I don't know you.

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:03.229
Oh, you know me.

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:08.234
You know everything
you need to know.

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:12.205
Look at me.

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:17.149
Open your eyes.

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:20.050
Please.

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:22.157
Open your eyes!

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:37.138
Have you been with another man?

01:14:39.274 --> 01:14:41.037
No.

01:14:41.176 --> 01:14:45.044
What are you doing, then?
What's going on in there?

01:14:47.282 --> 01:14:49.250
Why do you keep
sneaking around?

01:14:50.185 --> 01:14:53.245
Is the suspicion exciting?
Do you need it to get off? What is it?

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:58.056
I found Adele's letters.

01:15:01.296 --> 01:15:03.059
You...

01:15:03.298 --> 01:15:06.131
...found... her letters?

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:11.139
Is that how you tell the story?

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:15.109
What, they were just sitting
on the table...

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:17.236
...and you just happened
to notice them?

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:35.254
Look what just happened to find.
These... and these.

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:40.066
And found these. Here, read them.
I have nothing to hide, Alice!

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:02.156
To sneak around
behind my back because...

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:07.260
...you need it to get rougher
and rougher. Is that it?

01:16:09.298 --> 01:16:11.163
I'm trying to understand you.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.368
You do this
so punish you?

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:17.272
Is that where you're going?

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:29.114
Please, untie me.

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:31.116
If you trusted me...

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:35.223
...you wouldn't be in this position.

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:42.159
I just...

01:16:42.364 --> 01:16:45.231
I wanted to know more
about you.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.293
And wanted to
know your past.

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:50.338
And wanted to
know your stories.

01:16:52.374 --> 01:16:56.242
I just thought if knew more,
that could love you more.

01:17:01.316 --> 01:17:05.184
I know the only thing that matters
is us together. Know that.

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:08.382
Because when you're
not around I get lost.

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:13.292
It drives me crazy to
think about losing you.

01:17:20.435 --> 01:17:22.300
I'm yours, Alice.

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.308
What more do you need to know?

01:17:36.251 --> 01:17:38.412
I could break your neck.
I love you so much.

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:46.427
Do you want to stay here?

01:17:47.362 --> 01:17:48.420
I mean,

01:17:50.365 --> 01:17:52.230
do you like this?

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:57.431
Adam...
have to pee.

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:47.255
Oh, my God. Alice?

01:18:54.463 --> 01:18:57.330
Alice, please don't do this!
Alice!

01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:03.299
Please.

01:19:04.272 --> 01:19:05.432
Where are you going?

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:10.344
Alice, please,
what are you doing?

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:38.339
Alice?

01:20:38.633 --> 01:20:40.498
And that's when
came to you.

01:20:59.487 --> 01:21:01.352
I want to be clear with you.

01:21:01.489 --> 01:21:04.549
In my experience, charges of domestic
violence are too little too late.

01:21:05.393 --> 01:21:07.554
I want you to re-open
the Adele Blanchard case.

01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:11.566
Well, it's not easy to re-open
a case like this.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.559
- Britain is swimming in missing persons.
- He killed her.

01:21:15.403 --> 01:21:18.372
Any case,
missing person or murder...

01:21:19.407 --> 01:21:22.570
needs evidence.
I have to ask you what you have.

01:21:23.578 --> 01:21:25.443
Adele's letters?

01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:27.380
No.

01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:28.609
Warning notes?

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:31.416
- No.
- You have...

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:34.581
two photos.

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:37.522
Proof of nothing.

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:41.629
- He raped Michelle.
- She never reported it.

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:51.630
Yes?

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:57.445
Start without me.
I'll be thee in a bit.

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:04.652
I'd like to help you, Mrs. Tallis.

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:09.650
...knew what everyone else does,
but we like it.

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:12.653
He can't see you.

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:15.554
She's pretty shaken up.
- Is she?

01:22:16.498 --> 01:22:17.624
I mean, is she hurt?

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:20.668
Jesus, she was running into traffic.
Let's get a doctor. Is there a doctor?

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:22.629
She'll be fine.

01:22:25.707 --> 01:22:27.572
I would never hurt her.

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:32.443
I love her.

01:22:32.714 --> 01:22:34.545
You brought him in?

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:36.584
He walked in looking for you.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:39.678
He brought a pair of shoes.
He was worried about your feet.

01:22:46.528 --> 01:22:49.691
I believe your husband has
the potential for violence.

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:52.700
I believe he's unpredictable.

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:55.600
But is he a murderer?

01:22:57.572 --> 01:22:58.698
I don't know.

01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:03.535
The truth is, what you two have been
doing together was consensual.

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:07.548
You said it yourself.

01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:10.448
You liked it.

01:23:30.605 --> 01:23:32.470
Can you close the blinds?

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:48.484
I won't be able to keep him
for more than a few hours.

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:53.585
That's as much of a window
I can give you.

01:23:53.728 --> 01:23:57.596
You're accusing a hero and
you have absolutely no evidence.

01:24:07.809 --> 01:24:09.572
Deborah?

01:24:12.647 --> 01:24:14.512
Alice, what's
happened to you?

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:17.709
I'm sorry.
I'm not crazy. I just...

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:20.521
I went to the police station but
they wouldn't believe me...

01:24:20.755 --> 01:24:23.724
Then he came in and he brought my
shoes and he thought was nuts.

01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:27.528
I know he's your brother but
you were her friend, too.

01:24:28.763 --> 01:24:31.732
You remember when you said that
you were either with him or not?

01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:34.694
Well, I'm not...
I'm trying to understand...

01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:36.737
I just...
wanna ask...

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:43.635
Was Françoise with
someone else?

01:24:50.685 --> 01:24:51.652
Yes.

01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:57.751
It wasn't an accident.
She left him...

01:24:59.594 --> 01:25:00.754
...so he killed her.

01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:10.838
Maybe.

01:25:20.748 --> 01:25:22.807
This is the anchor that we used.

01:25:24.652 --> 01:25:26.620
It's made of titanium,
but the important thing is...

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:28.813
...it can hold two
thousand falling pounds.

01:25:29.657 --> 01:25:32.820
I've got a friend in Katmandu who sent
me an anchor they're making locally...

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:34.821
...with the wrong material.

01:25:35.763 --> 01:25:38.630
This is what happened with
just seventy five pounds.

01:25:39.767 --> 01:25:41.564
Maybe you're right.

01:25:41.636 --> 01:25:43.797
Adam could have switched the
anchors for Françoise's group.

01:25:49.777 --> 01:25:51.642
He killed them.

01:26:29.817 --> 01:26:31.876
Leave him, Alice.
I know him.

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:35.687
You have to leave him
for your own good.

01:26:36.925 --> 01:26:39.894
Deborah, it's not the only time.

01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:41.852
What?

01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:44.694
I think that he was with
a woman, Adele Blanchard.

01:26:44.832 --> 01:26:46.891
And think that she was gonna leave
him to go back to her husband.

01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:49.703
But
think that he killed her.

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:52.907
Adele was never gonna
go back to Michael.

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:54.901
Everyone knew
their marriage was over.

01:26:57.745 --> 01:26:58.905
I read her letters.

01:26:59.847 --> 01:27:01.906
She ended it with Adam.

01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:08.813
I think that... that she's there.

01:27:09.857 --> 01:27:10.915
What?

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:16.897
I went to the police. They won't do
anything, they need evidence.

01:27:18.866 --> 01:27:21.835
I think he buried her here,
at St. Edmundís.

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:24.838
I need you to help me find her.

01:27:26.774 --> 01:27:28.742
Do you wanna go with me?

01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:43.948
I have a confession to make.

01:27:46.794 --> 01:27:47.954
I sent you those notes.

01:27:49.797 --> 01:27:52.857
I know about my brother's violence.
I've seen it.

01:27:56.904 --> 01:27:58.963
I should've done more, but...
There's no excuse...

01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:03.875
But he scares me.

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:10.781
I'm glad you got away
from him, Alice.

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:14.989
You'll be okay now.

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:55.015
- Can I take that?
- Yeah, sure.

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.020
I think it's here.

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:03.929
He took the pictures
just by the angel.

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:48.906
Oh my God!

01:30:49.143 --> 01:30:50.110
Deborah.

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:25.009
Deborah!

01:31:30.952 --> 01:31:32.920
She didn't have to die.

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:39.092
If only she'd told me
she was going back to Michael.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.160
I gave her one, too.

01:31:49.103 --> 01:31:51.162
She thought it was beautiful,
just like you did.

01:31:52.106 --> 01:31:53.971
Why did you to this?

01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:55.971
Why did you do this?

01:32:00.047 --> 01:32:03.107
Who do you think gave him his first
piece of silk? He was just fifteen.

01:32:03.951 --> 01:32:05.919
I'm talking about fucking, Alice!

01:32:07.955 --> 01:32:10.116
That's right.
We fucked right here!

01:32:17.965 --> 01:32:19.125
Adam is mine.

01:32:19.967 --> 01:32:21.127
He's mine!

01:32:37.985 --> 01:32:39.043
Why?!

01:32:40.087 --> 01:32:44.046
I was never yours.
We were kids. Kids.

01:32:47.194 --> 01:32:49.958
It's over.
It's all over.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.160
Alice?

01:32:58.072 --> 01:32:59.164
Oh, my God.

01:33:17.024 --> 01:33:18.048
Adam.

01:34:03.237 --> 01:34:05.102
She and I...

01:34:09.343 --> 01:34:11.311
We used to come
here together.

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:20.280
I just thought
you had to trust me.

01:35:08.235 --> 01:35:10.100
And that's how it ended.

01:35:11.138 --> 01:35:15.199
Yet, not a day goes by without at
least one thought about the passion.

01:35:16.343 --> 01:35:18.208
Maybe was so
blinded by it...

01:35:19.146 --> 01:35:22.115
that missed all the clues
to his past.

01:35:32.393 --> 01:35:34.224
I often wonder...

01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:38.163
what would have happened if
I hadn't looked up that morning.

01:35:48.309 --> 01:35:51.278
Two years later,
I saw him once more.

01:36:30.184 --> 01:36:31.344
I don't know.

01:36:32.286 --> 01:36:36.245
Maybe a flatlander like me
can't live at that altitude.

01:36:38.292 --> 01:36:41.261
Maybe it never would have been
possible to sustain what we had.

01:36:43.397 --> 01:36:45.160
Maybe.

01:36:47.201 --> 01:36:49.260
Well, that's what
I tell myself...

01:36:50.305 --> 01:36:56.511
