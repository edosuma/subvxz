00:20.738 --> 00:22.572
What did you do to me?

00:25.476 --> 00:28.011
<i>Red-headed? Scar
on the left side of his face?</i>

00:28.045 --> 00:30.647

03:19.750 --> 03:21.918
Yes. I know.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.052
Yeah.

03:23.086 --> 03:25.054
There is nothing wrong with selling out.

03:25.088 --> 03:26.789
That is part of politics,
but when you do,

03:26.824 --> 03:28.057
you need to get paid in capital.

03:28.091 --> 03:29.158
Who pissed her off this time?

03:29.193 --> 03:31.561
Best I can tell, someone
released a press release

03:31.595 --> 03:32.662
without her release.

03:32.696 --> 03:34.697
...I get a little perturbed. You follow?

03:34.731 --> 03:37.767
With a company like Roxxon, you are
already rolling the boulder uphill.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.869
So, what are you gonna do?

03:39.903 --> 03:41.370
About what?

03:43.073 --> 03:45.341
About seeing the coach for the first
time since you threw that punch?

03:48.212 --> 03:50.346
- I don't know.
- Well, here's what you do.

03:50.380 --> 03:51.547
Show up early,

03:51.582 --> 03:53.216
practice free-throws,

03:53.250 --> 03:54.383
like Larry Bird.

03:54.418 --> 03:55.952
What's with you and Larry Bird, Dad?

03:55.986 --> 03:57.587
Get me the number for Pest Control.

03:57.621 --> 03:59.522
Yeah.

03:59.556 --> 04:01.591
...but he's underrated,

04:01.625 --> 04:03.926
and he's always had a good work ethic.

04:03.961 --> 04:06.062
So, you think I lack work ethic?

04:06.096 --> 04:07.530
I think sometimes...

04:07.564 --> 04:09.198
you're all over the place, Tyrone.

04:09.233 --> 04:11.200
You know what?

04:11.235 --> 04:13.369
Forget about Larry Bird.

04:13.403 --> 04:15.538
You want a role model? Look right there.

04:15.572 --> 04:19.108
Eight years ago,
fate pushed us down hard.

04:19.142 --> 04:20.942
- Mm-hmm.
- She got up first

04:20.978 --> 04:22.211
and picked us up with her.

04:22.246 --> 04:23.479
- I know.
- You know that, right?

04:23.514 --> 04:24.614
Yeah, of course I do.

04:24.648 --> 04:26.249
Hell, be more like her.

04:26.283 --> 04:28.918
Coach will want four more
like you on that court.

04:28.952 --> 04:31.521
I... I don't think I could ever
live up to that kinda game.

04:31.555 --> 04:33.656
I don't think Larry Bird could.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.392
But try, you know? For us.

04:36.426 --> 04:37.593
Okay?

04:45.903 --> 04:46.903
You okay?

04:47.938 --> 04:48.938
I'm in deep shit.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.875
- I need to get out of town.
- What happened?

04:54.344 --> 04:57.079
Do you remember that guy from
the other night? At the club?

04:58.482 --> 05:00.917
Well... he tracked me down and...

05:00.951 --> 05:02.952
- He was pissed?
- He was a lot of things.

05:04.021 --> 05:05.054
Did he hurt you?

05:05.088 --> 05:07.990
I'm fine, okay?

05:08.025 --> 05:10.393
I got lucky and stabbed him
in the gut to put him down.

05:10.419 --> 05:11.580
Stabbed him with what?

05:11.617 --> 05:13.805
A knife, Liam. What else
do you stab people with?

05:13.830 --> 05:15.498
Since when do you carry a knife?

05:20.704 --> 05:23.172
All right, how about the guy?
I mean, uh...

05:23.206 --> 05:25.308
did you just hurt him
or did you... I mean, is he...

05:25.342 --> 05:28.044
- I don't know.
- Okay. And where is it now, the knife?

05:28.078 --> 05:30.012
- It's gone.
- Are you sure?

05:30.047 --> 05:32.615
Yeah. Yeah, I'm positive.

05:38.889 --> 05:40.923
- What are you doing?
- Calling Saint Elizabeth's

05:40.958 --> 05:43.159
to see if anybody's brought him in.

05:44.995 --> 05:48.164
No, call... call Tulane Medical,

05:48.198 --> 05:50.066
the good one.
He comes from money, right?

05:50.100 --> 05:52.001
Yeah.

05:52.035 --> 05:55.104
<i>- Tulane Medical Center.
- Yeah, emergency room please.</i>

05:55.138 --> 05:57.773
<i>Please hold.</i>

06:00.744 --> 06:02.345
What should I be hoping for?

06:07.217 --> 06:10.152
If he's alive, then that
means he can still ID me.

06:12.356 --> 06:14.957
If he's dead, then I killed somebody,

06:14.992 --> 06:16.993
which... Jesus.

06:18.428 --> 06:20.029
Which one should I be hoping for?

06:22.165 --> 06:24.367
Just control what we can control, okay?

06:25.369 --> 06:26.602
We'll get you to the dry cleaner's.

06:26.637 --> 06:28.170
We'll get you some new papers.

06:28.205 --> 06:29.739
We'll get you someplace safe.

06:32.109 --> 06:33.109
Yeah?

06:34.945 --> 06:35.945
Yeah, okay.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.355
You look tired.

06:48.091 --> 06:49.525
Yeah, I had trouble sleeping again.

06:50.560 --> 06:51.861
And the pills I prescribed?

06:53.296 --> 06:55.031
I'm not taking 'em.

06:55.065 --> 06:56.532
Why not?

06:57.534 --> 06:58.901
The same reason I don't drink.

06:58.935 --> 07:00.302
It's about having some control.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.505
It's about having complete control.

07:02.539 --> 07:05.374
Then explain that fight to me.
Why'd you hit the other boy?

07:05.409 --> 07:06.509
Because he's an asshole.

07:07.778 --> 07:10.479
He pushed on me first, so I...
I didn't do anything wrong.

07:10.514 --> 07:13.449
- Then why not tell me about it?
- Because I... I knew what you'd say.

07:13.483 --> 07:14.483
And what's that?

07:15.819 --> 07:18.287
The same thing you've been
saying for the last three years.

07:18.321 --> 07:21.590
That losing my brother
begat survivor's guilt

07:21.625 --> 07:24.126
which begat compulsive tendencies

07:24.161 --> 07:26.095
which results in bottled-up anger.

07:26.129 --> 07:27.296
Old Testament verbs aside,

07:27.330 --> 07:30.032
you sound like you know
what you're talking about.

07:30.067 --> 07:33.469
Except it's not anger in the bottle.
Know what it is?

07:35.772 --> 07:36.906
It's poison...

07:38.241 --> 07:40.876
coursing through your veins every day.

07:41.978 --> 07:43.979
And when that bottle gets shook up

07:44.014 --> 07:46.415
the poison comes out in unexpected ways.

07:47.651 --> 07:48.851
You have no idea.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.520
What's that supposed to mean?

07:54.257 --> 07:55.858
All this anger inside of me...

07:57.394 --> 07:58.661
What if it came out and pointed me

07:58.695 --> 08:00.129
to the person who poisoned me?

08:02.499 --> 08:04.333
If I could find
the person who caused it?

08:05.635 --> 08:06.635
And punish him...

08:08.105 --> 08:09.205
poison him?

08:10.807 --> 08:12.742
You talking about finding that cop?

08:12.776 --> 08:14.110
I thought you moved past that.

08:14.144 --> 08:16.779
No, no, no, I'm just...
I'm talking about a "what if."

08:16.813 --> 08:19.148
What if this guy really existed?
What if I could find him?

08:20.884 --> 08:22.218
This poison running through my veins,

08:22.252 --> 08:23.652
doesn't it belong in his too?

08:24.654 --> 08:27.223
Eye for an eye, right?

08:28.825 --> 08:30.626
Let me throw a "what if" back at you.

08:32.596 --> 08:34.163
What if God heard you talking like this?

08:35.398 --> 08:36.599
What would He say?

08:36.633 --> 08:37.866
Who's to say He's not the one

08:37.900 --> 08:39.434
who gave me the idea in the first place?

08:44.975 --> 08:47.309
Let's keep on this
topic tomorrow morning, okay?

08:47.344 --> 08:48.778
Yeah.

08:49.813 --> 08:50.813
Yeah, okay.

08:50.847 --> 08:52.281
"Has thou not known?

08:53.416 --> 08:54.750
"Has thou not heard

08:54.785 --> 08:55.951
"that the everlasting God,

08:55.986 --> 08:59.288

of the ends of the Earth,

08:59.322 --> 09:01.590
"fainteth not, neither is weary?

09:03.093 --> 09:04.960
"There is no searching
of his understanding.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.730
"He giveth power to the faint,

09:07.764 --> 09:09.732
"and to them that have no might...

09:11.201 --> 09:12.835
he increaseth strength."

09:14.070 --> 09:16.172
"That bringeth the princes to nothing,

09:16.206 --> 09:18.742
he maketh the judges
of the Earth as vanity."

09:18.809 --> 09:20.910
"Yea, they shall not be planted,

09:20.944 --> 09:23.012
"yea, they shall not be sown:

09:23.046 --> 09:25.514
"yea, their stock shall not
take root in the earth:

"and he shall also blow upon them,

"and they shall wither,

09:29.052 --> 09:32.454

take them away as stubble.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.957
"To whom then will ye liken me,

09:34.991 --> 09:38.327
"or shall I be equal?
Saith the Holy One.

09:38.361 --> 09:40.162
"Lift up your eyes on high,

Everything you asked for will

- What about the ammunition? Is it...
- Everything you asked for.

12:38.181 --> 12:39.748
Hey, Elmer.

12:39.803 --> 12:41.938
- You know Tandy?
- I know her work.

12:41.972 --> 12:43.217
Listen, you guys wanna move swag,

12:43.256 --> 12:44.707
you have to come back after hours.

12:44.741 --> 12:46.209
Listen, Elmer, we got in some trouble,

12:46.243 --> 12:49.645
and Tandy needs to get outta
town, needs a new ID, ASAP.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.747
Trouble? Did you commit a crime?

12:51.782 --> 12:53.449
I thought you said,
"No questions asked."

12:53.484 --> 12:55.117
If you didn't commit
a crime, I got a guy

12:55.152 --> 12:57.119
who can knock up
a Minnesota for three bills.

12:57.154 --> 12:59.856
But if you did, you'll need
a much better one.

12:59.890 --> 13:01.924
Okay, how much better for how much?

13:01.959 --> 13:03.426
It'll run you guys 11 grand.

13:03.460 --> 13:05.261
Bullshit.

13:05.295 --> 13:07.897
Situation you're in, you're
going to need a new identity,

13:07.931 --> 13:10.266
clean social, even an address of record.

13:10.300 --> 13:12.635
I got a guy who can
throw in a credit rating too.

13:12.669 --> 13:15.872
Anyone comes looking for
you, you're not you.

13:15.906 --> 13:17.507
Then you can do whatever you want.

13:17.541 --> 13:18.908
So, what do you want?

13:22.246 --> 13:23.479
I wanna leave New Orleans...

13:24.515 --> 13:26.482
and I never wanna look back.

13:26.517 --> 13:27.884
Then you're going to need legit docs.

13:27.918 --> 13:29.785
Well, I don't have that kind of money.

13:29.820 --> 13:31.721
I can scrounge up five or six.

13:31.755 --> 13:33.789
Liam, no, you don't have to do that.

13:33.824 --> 13:36.225
That guy that you hurt is in
ICU, and he's going to wake up.

13:36.260 --> 13:37.693
Clock is ticking.

13:38.929 --> 13:40.229
Can you dig up the rest?

13:43.133 --> 13:45.180
Yeah.

13:45.229 --> 13:46.594
Yeah, I can see
what I have stashed away.

13:46.619 --> 13:47.637
Okay.

14:20.704 --> 14:21.737
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:21.772 --> 14:25.007
Tandy, is... everything okay?

14:25.042 --> 14:26.809
Yeah. Yeah, no, everything's good.

14:26.843 --> 14:29.211
I just need to go to the bathroom
and grab a couple things, so.

14:31.381 --> 14:33.683
- Hi.
- Wow. Uh...

14:34.751 --> 14:36.986
Okay, uh, you must be Tandy.

14:37.020 --> 14:40.289
This is Greg, my boyfriend, the
one I've been telling you about.

14:40.324 --> 14:42.191
Yeah, your mom has told me
so much about you.

14:42.225 --> 14:43.492
It's a pleasure to meet you.

14:44.628 --> 14:45.995
It's a pleasure to do a lot of things.

14:46.029 --> 14:47.897
Well, you know... we...
we've been celebrating.

14:47.931 --> 14:51.901
Greg has been working hard on a
new angle for our Roxxon case.

14:51.935 --> 14:54.737
He actually filed an injunction
for us this morning.

14:54.771 --> 14:57.039
In all fairness to your mom...
she's really been on top of it,

14:57.074 --> 14:59.308
you know, and I've been
doing some digging...

14:59.343 --> 15:00.864
Yeah. No, it seems like
you've really been working

15:00.888 --> 15:01.911
your pants off, Greg.

15:01.912 --> 15:03.212
Tandy.

15:03.246 --> 15:04.914
We don't talk to guests like that.

15:04.948 --> 15:06.148
It's okay.

15:07.985 --> 15:09.685
My bad.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.577
Um, I have to use the bathroom
and grab a couple of things.

15:11.601 --> 15:13.124
Tandy.

15:14.291 --> 15:16.525
- Before you go in there...
- Mom, I'll be out in a bit.

15:27.070 --> 15:28.904
Honey, before you say anything...

15:28.939 --> 15:30.506
Oh, anything, like, "What the shit?"

15:30.540 --> 15:32.041
Because what the shit, Mom?

15:32.075 --> 15:33.509
I wasn't certain whose it was.

15:33.543 --> 15:36.045
Mom, we bought this bag
when I was seven, remember?

15:39.249 --> 15:41.050
Hell. Maybe you don't.

15:41.084 --> 15:42.551
Honey, it was a moment of weakness.

15:42.586 --> 15:44.787
Yeah, well, no one lives
in the moment like you do.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.261
Mom, please tell me
you still have that cash.

15:53.864 --> 15:55.331
We needed it for the injunction.

15:55.365 --> 15:57.033
You cannot be this stupid!

15:57.067 --> 15:59.769
Watch your mouth. This is my house.

15:59.803 --> 16:01.537
No, this is not a house.

16:01.571 --> 16:03.039
This is a temporary shelter.

16:03.073 --> 16:04.407
And that is not your boyfriend.

16:04.441 --> 16:05.574
He's just another asshole

16:05.609 --> 16:07.576
on a sex tour of the FEMA islands.

16:09.046 --> 16:11.247
Are you really going to stand
there all high and mighty, Tandy?

16:12.282 --> 16:14.183
Where'd the money come from?

16:14.217 --> 16:16.118
And the pill bottles,
each with a different name?

16:16.153 --> 16:18.988
- You think I'm blind?
- No, just that you don't care.

16:19.022 --> 16:20.722
Okay, okay, why...
why don't we just sit down...

16:20.746 --> 16:23.659
- Slow your roll, Greg.
- No, don't you talk to him like that.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.732
You know, how about I just
don't talk to anybody?

16:29.766 --> 16:32.334
Here we go.
Things must be getting tough,

16:32.369 --> 16:34.170
because Tandy's gonna run away.

16:35.172 --> 16:37.339
If your father was still alive,

16:37.374 --> 16:39.942
I swear to God,
he would be heart-broken!

16:51.822 --> 16:54.290
Well, there goes Fenwick's lunch.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.126
Six more laps, young ladies,

16:57.160 --> 16:58.212
then maybe...

16:58.236 --> 17:00.423
we will get to the business at hand!

17:02.566 --> 17:04.900
Wow. There he is.

17:04.935 --> 17:07.002
Coach, listen, I'm sorry late.
I lost track of time.

17:07.037 --> 17:08.671
I didn't say, "Stop."

17:10.941 --> 17:13.709
Keep going while I update Mr. Johnson

17:13.743 --> 17:15.978
on what we've been doing
all day at practice.

17:16.012 --> 17:18.114
Twenty-five for that haymaker you threw.

17:18.147 --> 17:20.148
Fifty more because you were late.

17:20.183 --> 17:22.050
I'm going to tack on another 20

17:22.085 --> 17:23.853
because you actually had
the balls to show up.

17:23.887 --> 17:26.188
No, look, that's all on me.

17:26.223 --> 17:27.990
Look, I'll suit up,
and I'll take the punishment.

17:28.023 --> 17:30.392
Hell no. Stay in your civvies,

17:30.427 --> 17:31.698
get up on the bleachers.

17:31.722 --> 17:33.429
Think about what you
could have done different.

17:49.679 --> 17:51.480
Twenty-eight more laps!

18:00.891 --> 18:03.225
- Thursday good?
- No, I need these now.

18:03.260 --> 18:05.060
The pictures are in, like, an hour.

18:05.095 --> 18:07.563
I need you to fix the tear.

18:07.597 --> 18:09.098
The "cumberbatch" too.

18:13.637 --> 18:16.172
- Yes, yes, okay.
- Thank you. Good.

18:20.243 --> 18:21.744
This is only $5,500.

18:21.778 --> 18:25.114
- Well, it's all that we have.
- Then you haven't got anything.

18:25.148 --> 18:27.082
Come on, man. There's gotta
be something you can do.

18:27.117 --> 18:28.517
Sorry. This isn't a charity.

18:39.429 --> 18:40.729
Do you trust me?

18:41.898 --> 18:43.632
- Course I do.
- Then hand me the money.

18:47.270 --> 18:49.471
Here's the down payment, non-refundable.

18:49.506 --> 18:51.941
- That's not how it works.
- We fail, you still profit.

18:51.975 --> 18:53.576
Ain't that America?

18:56.513 --> 18:58.547
I just need to borrow
one thing to get the rest.

18:58.582 --> 19:00.115
Borrow what?

19:01.318 --> 19:02.585
Can I see the little button thingee?

19:18.268 --> 19:19.301
Hey.

19:23.773 --> 19:25.207
Hi. How's it going?

19:27.844 --> 19:31.614
Boom. Jenna Westen
binged sushi on Bourbon.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.415
- Tourists.
- Food poisoning.

19:33.450 --> 19:36.518
That makes you my Harrison.

20:28.095 --> 20:30.429
What's the play? Abandoned purses?

20:30.464 --> 20:34.700
No. No, too small, too conspicuous.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.553
There are three
sensible cash grabs in here.

20:37.803 --> 20:40.237
Cards in a cage, ready to be liberated,

20:40.272 --> 20:42.073
and the big cash bar over there.

20:42.107 --> 20:44.442
Cash bar. Cheap pricks.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.378
And what's the third grab?

20:49.915 --> 20:51.236
Someone's in charge of the tips

20:51.267 --> 20:53.384
for the caterers, band, bartender.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.086
Probably the wedding planner.

20:56.788 --> 20:59.290
Man. Sometimes I forget that
you came from all this.

21:01.860 --> 21:03.461
You know, she should
have it on her person.

21:03.495 --> 21:05.029
Should be at least
a couple grand in there.

21:05.063 --> 21:07.164
We need to find her,
find a way to lift it.

21:09.367 --> 21:11.068
What do we do if somebody talks to me?

21:11.103 --> 21:14.305
- Talk back.
- As Harrison Westen?

21:14.339 --> 21:16.740
Heck no. Someone's bound to
know the Westens aren't here.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.609
- Anyone else.
- Who?

21:18.643 --> 21:19.810
I don't know.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.047

I mean with what happened today,
missing practice and everything.

24:06.811 --> 24:08.545
Oh, you wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

24:08.580 --> 24:11.148
Try me. We're on the same team, right?

24:11.182 --> 24:14.184
Yeah.

24:14.219 --> 24:16.387
Yeah, man. I suppose we are.

24:16.443 --> 24:18.074
I mean, one of us messes up,

24:18.098 --> 24:19.629
we all pay.

24:19.860 --> 24:21.795
That's what went down
today anyway, right?

24:21.893 --> 24:24.728
All right, listen, guys. I'm sorry
you had to run suicides, okay?

24:24.763 --> 24:27.331
- I didn't mean to...
- You didn't mean to what?

24:27.365 --> 24:29.600
Miss practice? Hit that kid?

24:29.634 --> 24:32.002
Miss those two easy boards
against Waverly?

24:32.037 --> 24:33.671
Look, what the hell are you guys doing?

24:33.705 --> 24:35.572
We're going to state finals
next week, and we're concerned

24:35.607 --> 24:37.007
that you're gonna be
screwing it up for us.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.776
No, listen, I promise I won't...

25:29.876 --> 25:32.144
I chatted up the wedding planner,
but she doesn't have the cash.

25:33.146 --> 25:34.980
- Okay, so who does?
- The maid of honor.

25:35.014 --> 25:36.948
Apparently, she insisted.

25:36.983 --> 25:39.418
Linda did not appreciate her bossiness.

25:39.452 --> 25:41.520
Okay. Linda's the wedding planner?

25:41.554 --> 25:43.855
Uh-huh. And Delia...
that's the maid of honor...

25:43.890 --> 25:46.858
is the thorn in Linda's side,
treats her like the help,

25:46.893 --> 25:49.528
is always putting her nose
in other people's business,

25:49.562 --> 25:52.230
and has resting basic face.

25:52.265 --> 25:54.199
Is that a thing?

25:56.402 --> 25:58.470
No, but it should be.

26:02.108 --> 26:03.208
Liam, thank you.

26:04.210 --> 26:05.210
For what?

26:08.614 --> 26:10.115
For helping me with all of this.

26:11.651 --> 26:13.919
For never asking any questions

26:13.953 --> 26:15.454
or second-guessing me.

26:17.990 --> 26:19.858
Not ever, really.

26:22.195 --> 26:23.695
Thank you for just being you.

26:26.933 --> 26:28.099
You make it easy.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.321
You remember the first time we met?

26:49.355 --> 26:52.390
Of course. I was
trying to get into Aperture.

26:52.425 --> 26:55.026
With that horrible Utah ID.

26:55.061 --> 26:58.063
Well, someone was busting my
chops, asking for my zodiac sign.

26:58.097 --> 26:59.965
Vertigo. You said vertigo.

27:02.001 --> 27:03.001
It made you smile.

27:04.136 --> 27:05.270
Yeah, it very much did.

27:07.106 --> 27:08.740
Hey, but you didn't let me in.

27:08.774 --> 27:10.442
Well, that would've been malpractice.

27:11.444 --> 27:13.578
- But you came back.
- With a better ID.

27:13.613 --> 27:15.647
Massachusetts. Land of Lincoln.

27:19.085 --> 27:20.752
Listen.

27:20.786 --> 27:24.389
I know I don't come from money
or class like you do...

27:24.423 --> 27:26.391
but if you give me a chance,

27:26.425 --> 27:27.759
I'll keep you safe.

27:28.995 --> 27:30.595
I'll do what I can to make you happy.

27:33.132 --> 27:34.332
I'll love you.

27:36.035 --> 27:37.035
Always.

27:54.420 --> 27:55.720
Tandy?

27:55.755 --> 27:57.389
Are... are you okay?

27:58.991 --> 28:00.492
Tandy, what?

28:00.526 --> 28:01.526
Umm...

28:02.562 --> 28:04.329
I have to... I have to go.

28:12.405 --> 28:14.806
Ah.

28:39.398 --> 28:41.066
Hey, Ma.

28:41.100 --> 28:44.102
No, no, Coach kept us late running.
He was in a mood.

28:45.905 --> 28:47.372
Yeah, it still kinda is,

28:47.406 --> 28:49.908
so, uh, might not be back for a bit.

28:52.545 --> 28:54.012
Yeah, of course I'll stay safe.

29:09.595 --> 29:12.297
Excuse me. Are you okay?

29:12.331 --> 29:14.966
Yeah. I'm fine.

29:16.736 --> 29:18.303
Sorry, was I making a scene?

29:18.337 --> 29:21.106
No, not at all. You look sad.

29:21.140 --> 29:23.208
God! I'm such a...

29:23.242 --> 29:25.276
No, you're not. What's wrong?

29:31.283 --> 29:32.817
I run away from everything.

29:34.286 --> 29:36.087
I mean, whenever anything
goes wrong or...

29:37.490 --> 29:40.925
hell, goes right,
I... I hightail it outta town.

29:42.228 --> 29:45.130
- Sometimes literally.
- I get it. I do it too.

29:46.365 --> 29:49.401
- It's kind of you to say, but...
- No, I swear to God.

29:49.435 --> 29:51.970
You know I switched my major four times?

29:52.004 --> 29:54.239
- Where'd you go to school?
- Tulane.

29:54.273 --> 29:56.107
- Is that how you met Lynn?
- Yeah.

29:56.142 --> 29:59.077
- How about you?
- Obligatory distant cousin.

29:59.111 --> 30:01.079
- Ah.
- So, what'd you land on?

30:01.113 --> 30:02.580
For a major?

30:02.615 --> 30:04.115
Clinical psychology.

30:04.150 --> 30:07.152
Oh. Well, definitely broke
down in the right place.

30:07.186 --> 30:08.987
Huh! I don't know about all that.

30:09.021 --> 30:11.122
I'm still limited
to the basic questions.

30:11.148 --> 30:12.701
- Like what?
- Like...

30:12.779 --> 30:14.912
"Tell me about your father and mother."

30:17.263 --> 30:20.865
The first one's dead, and the
second one is killing me.

30:20.900 --> 30:22.367
Is that what's upsetting you right now?

30:23.602 --> 30:25.070
No.

30:25.104 --> 30:27.439
No, there's this boy out there
who wants nothing more

30:27.473 --> 30:29.207
than to spend his whole life with me.

30:29.241 --> 30:31.543
- Sounds horrible.
- Right?

30:31.577 --> 30:33.511
Me? All I could do is run away.

30:37.616 --> 30:39.350
Maybe my Mom was right about me.

30:40.352 --> 30:42.721
Okay, I need you to do me a favor.

30:42.755 --> 30:45.890
Get it together, fix your mascara,

30:45.925 --> 30:47.792
and do something
that'll make you happy...

30:47.827 --> 30:51.196
tonight. Drink, dance...

30:51.230 --> 30:53.498
and worry about the rest
of your life tomorrow.

30:53.532 --> 30:55.200
Can you do that for me?

30:56.902 --> 30:58.002
Yeah.

30:59.038 --> 31:00.405
Yeah, I can do that.

31:03.142 --> 31:04.342
You feel better now?

31:08.114 --> 31:10.181
I really, really do.

32:10.643 --> 32:12.911
Thank you for everything.

32:12.945 --> 32:15.547
People went crazy over
those figs in a blanket.

32:15.581 --> 32:16.581
Here.

32:27.459 --> 32:28.459
We gotta go.

32:35.234 --> 32:37.468
- Come on.
- What's up?

32:37.503 --> 32:38.970
Resting basic face is onto us.

32:40.206 --> 32:41.439
We gotta bounce.

32:51.313 --> 32:54.453
No way. No way!

32:54.523 --> 32:56.591
I told you he was trouble.

32:56.626 --> 32:58.994
From day one, girl.

32:59.028 --> 33:01.730
Yeah, I didn't. Hold on.

33:03.799 --> 33:05.400
Sorry, I'll just be...

33:06.502 --> 33:10.572
I swear to Saint Francis
I just had a $20 bill.

33:24.387 --> 33:26.187
Can I get a fifth
of the O'Harrens, please?

33:33.095 --> 33:34.996
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

33:35.031 --> 33:37.032
- Sorry I missed dinner.
- Don't sweat it.

33:37.066 --> 33:38.867
Thanks for calling to check in.

33:38.901 --> 33:39.901
Yeah.

33:47.476 --> 33:49.210
- Hey, Ma?
- Yes, sweetheart?

33:51.814 --> 33:52.814
How do you do it?

33:54.450 --> 33:57.185
How do you keep it all together?

33:57.219 --> 34:00.455
Keep everything running like clockwork
after all we've been through?

34:02.325 --> 34:04.559
We're not the first to suffer.
We won't be the last.

34:06.963 --> 34:08.663
You're probably too young
to remember this,

34:08.697 --> 34:10.431
but a while back I wasn't together

34:10.466 --> 34:12.600
by any definition.

34:13.902 --> 34:16.871
But after some time,
I came to a conclusion.

34:18.007 --> 34:20.574
- What was that?
- I had to put it away.

34:22.411 --> 34:24.411
All the anxiety, all of the guilt.

34:25.915 --> 34:28.016
If I couldn't...

34:28.050 --> 34:30.185
then I'd turn it
into something positive.

34:32.188 --> 34:33.355
Did it work?

34:34.889 --> 34:36.791
Well, I'm keeping it
all together, aren't I?

34:38.260 --> 34:40.027
Trying my best to put
some good folks in office,

34:40.062 --> 34:41.896
make life safer for some other families.

34:43.532 --> 34:44.565
That's amazing, Ma.

34:46.869 --> 34:47.869
You okay?

34:49.705 --> 34:50.804
Yeah, I will be.

34:54.143 --> 34:55.143
Thank you, Ma.

35:30.079 --> 35:32.180
Mom, Billy's trying
to make me eat cooties.

35:32.214 --> 35:34.482
You don't eat cooties, you idiot.
You get 'em from a girl.

35:34.517 --> 35:36.117
Don't make a scene, you two.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.655
Stay close. Don't wander off, Billy!

35:40.689 --> 35:42.457
Billy!

35:43.459 --> 35:44.459
Billy.

35:46.796 --> 35:47.796
Tyrone!

35:49.165 --> 35:50.165
Tyrone!

35:50.199 --> 35:51.966
Tyrone!

35:52.001 --> 35:53.835
Tyrone!

35:54.870 --> 35:55.870
Tyrone.

36:31.273 --> 36:32.607
Whoa!

36:34.844 --> 36:36.077
Oh.

36:36.112 --> 36:39.247
- You okay, Ma?
- I don't know why I'm so dizzy.

36:41.283 --> 36:43.718
- Hey.
- Because you put too much on yourself.

36:43.752 --> 36:45.220
No. What? No, it's important...

36:45.254 --> 36:46.754
No, no, no, it's not.

36:50.326 --> 36:51.559
Someone poisoned you.

36:52.928 --> 36:54.796
A long time ago, Ma.

36:54.830 --> 36:57.031
What are you talking about, sweetheart?

36:58.033 --> 37:00.001
Nothing.

37:00.035 --> 37:02.270
- You just need some rest, okay?
- No, there's just too much to do.

37:02.304 --> 37:04.439
There's so much... there's
so much going on, you know?

37:04.473 --> 37:05.473
Yeah.

37:06.742 --> 37:08.343
I know.

37:48.651 --> 37:51.486
So, what happened to you
when we were dancing?

37:53.022 --> 37:54.255
What made you run off?

37:54.290 --> 37:56.224
- It's kinda hard to explain.
- Try me.

38:00.029 --> 38:02.697
I don't know if I can. Can you...

38:07.870 --> 38:09.604
I know that you live in that church.

38:12.675 --> 38:14.075
What are you talking about?

38:14.109 --> 38:16.377
I know when you're lying, too.

38:21.250 --> 38:23.251
- Liam, one time I...
- You're a good liar,

38:23.285 --> 38:25.153
but you're not as good as you
think you are, not with me.

38:28.057 --> 38:29.958
Why didn't you say anything?

38:29.992 --> 38:31.659
'Cause you didn't...

38:31.694 --> 38:34.229
you didn't want me to know, so I...
I didn't.

38:36.765 --> 38:38.600
Look, I... I know
you've got your demons.

38:39.602 --> 38:41.569
Everybody's got demons.

38:43.138 --> 38:44.639
If you just give me a chance...

38:45.841 --> 38:46.975
I can help you.

38:48.877 --> 38:50.311
We can handle it.

39:01.290 --> 39:02.924
Liam, listen.

39:08.030 --> 39:09.631
There is no "we."

39:14.036 --> 39:15.270
Sorry.

39:53.475 --> 39:56.177
Liam Walsh?

39:56.211 --> 39:58.079
You have the right to remain silent.
