WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:03.601
<i>Heil</i> this.

00:05.600 --> 00:06.726
Dude, you killed Hitler.

00:07.280 --> 00:08.327
Awesome.

00:08.480 --> 00:11.529
DEAN: <i>Saving people, hunting things,
this is our life.</i>

00:13.200 --> 00:14.770
<i>I think we make the world a better place.</i>

00:14.920 --> 00:16.763
I spent my life running from hunting.

00:17.280 --> 00:18.441
DEAN: <i>You were good at this, weren't you?</i>

00:18.760 --> 00:19.761
MARY: <i>Very.</i>

00:19.920 --> 00:21.570
The thing is, hunters...

00:23.840 --> 00:26.286
<i>No matter how good they are,
they all end up the same way.</i>

00:26.440 --> 00:28.010
No!

00:28.760 --> 00:29.807
DEAN: <i>Bobby!</i>

00:29.960 --> 00:31.962
I know all about you, Dean Winchester.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.441
DEAN: <i>Don't hurt her.
That's a human possessed by a demon.</i>

00:34.600 --> 00:36.648
SAM: <i>Regna terrae...</i>
MEG: <i>An exorcism?</i>

00:36.840 --> 00:38.444
- DEAN: You're gonna burn in hell.
- Wait!

00:40.960 --> 00:42.450
- SAM: How about some pie?
- Maybe later.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.648
<i>Ever since Mom left,
you've been a little, uh, cranky.</i>

00:44.800 --> 00:46.006
<i>What? She took some cash,
she took a cell phone</i>

00:46.160 --> 00:47.525
<i>and she doesn't answer,
and she bailed on us.</i>

00:47.680 --> 00:50.206
You know, sometimes, families do better
after a little time apart.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.164
Yeah, yeah, who? The Mansons?

01:35.280 --> 01:36.281
Huh?

01:48.040 --> 01:49.963
So this is your house?

01:55.520 --> 01:58.524
Look, you did a great job
of pointing directions,

01:58.720 --> 02:00.131
but words are helpful.

02:00.720 --> 02:04.167
And names. Like me? I'm Mary Winchester.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.210
Asa Fox.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.241
That's a great name.

02:09.840 --> 02:10.887
You're gonna be fine.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.645
I know it doesn't seem like it,
but you are.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.885
What was that thing?

02:19.280 --> 02:20.406
A werewolf.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.729
One I've been tracking for a long time.

02:24.440 --> 02:26.124
We had history. Come on.

02:27.560 --> 02:28.641
Werewolf?

02:31.600 --> 02:33.489
You kill werewolves?

02:34.880 --> 02:36.291
I hunted a lot of bad things.

02:36.920 --> 02:39.048
"Hunted"? Like, past tense?

02:39.960 --> 02:42.406
I'm retiring.
Well, officially, I'm already retired.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.244
Just tying up a few loose ends.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.564
But if you retire,
who's gonna save people like me?

02:51.320 --> 02:52.765
Uh, your mom in there?

02:56.360 --> 02:58.681
Good. Hey, let me just...

03:03.600 --> 03:04.601
That's better.

03:05.840 --> 03:06.841
Kind of.

03:08.360 --> 03:09.691
Well, go on.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.603
Hey, you know they make new cars, right?

04:55.200 --> 04:57.282
Don't want a new car.
This is my lucky car.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.249
Netflix...

05:31.440 --> 05:35.764
What do you recommend to fill my day off?
Speak to me.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.009
Wow! You look terrible. What's wrong?

05:49.200 --> 05:50.440
Sure, we'd love to come in.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.200
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.566
Yeah, we just, uh...

05:55.320 --> 05:56.845
Finished a haunt in Brookings.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.610
You couldn't take a shower first?

05:59.040 --> 06:00.326
Ha-ha.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.761
Figured we'd stop by on the way home.
See you, Claire, and Alex.

06:03.160 --> 06:06.050
Oh, that's fun. Unfortunately, the girls
are in Omaha for the weekend

06:06.200 --> 06:08.328
being angst-y at a Radiohead concert.

06:08.520 --> 06:09.806
But I can feed you.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.445
Yes. All right.

06:11.640 --> 06:12.641
Oh, uh...

06:13.000 --> 06:15.810
Since the last time we saw you,
I killed Hitler.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.809
- Thank you?
- You're welcome.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.489
<i>Jody, you watching
some kind of chick flick here?</i>

06:31.920 --> 06:33.604
Well, Dean, I'm a chick.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.122
No. No, no, no,
you're a badass, Sheriff chick,

06:36.280 --> 06:39.011
you're not a rom-com chick.
Wait, are you a rom-com chick?

06:39.360 --> 06:40.361
Are you?

06:40.800 --> 06:41.926
SAM: <i>He's more of a...</i>

06:42.640 --> 06:44.404
Animated, Japanese, erotica chick.

06:44.840 --> 06:45.921
Really?

06:46.640 --> 06:47.641
Mmm-hmm.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.166
I need to leave
this scintillating conversation.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.366
Dude, don't tell her that.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.721
Tell her what?

07:02.800 --> 07:05.531
- It's Jody, man.
- Uh, dude, be proud of your hobbies.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.446
Makes you who you are.

07:13.440 --> 07:14.487
Jody?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.487
Jody, what's up?

07:23.040 --> 07:24.201
A friend of mine died.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.087
Who?

07:28.760 --> 07:29.886
Asa Fox.

07:31.040 --> 07:34.044
Asa Fox.
Why does that name sound familiar?

07:35.120 --> 07:37.566
Isn't he that guy
that Ellen used to tell stories about

07:37.720 --> 07:38.801
back at the Roadhouse?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.287
Yeah, supposedly, he killed,
like, five Wendigos in a night.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.084
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.566
Yeah, he was a hunter.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.410
He rolled into town a few months back.

07:48.320 --> 07:51.244
Tried to convince me
he was FBI agent, Fox Mulder.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.848
<i>He was chasing a pack of ghouls
and I helped.</i>

07:54.480 --> 07:56.050
He'd pass through
every once in a while after that

07:56.240 --> 07:59.403
and we'd grab coffee or something.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.965
Oh, he was a good man.

08:08.520 --> 08:09.726
The wake's tonight,

08:10.400 --> 08:12.767
and they're gonna salt
and burn the body tomorrow.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.361
I can't believe I just said that
like it's something normal.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.321
Well, we're gonna come with you.

08:18.680 --> 08:19.761
Yeah.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.000
You don't have... I'll be fine.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.327
Yeah, no, Jody,
we know you'll be fine but...

08:27.360 --> 08:30.443
<i>You know, we never go
to hunter gatherings outside of ours.</i>

08:30.600 --> 08:32.284
Dad always said they were trouble, so...

08:34.240 --> 08:36.481
Yeah, so you'd be doing us a favor
if you let us tag along.

08:39.760 --> 08:40.921
<i>Thank you.</i>

08:41.200 --> 08:42.201
You're gonna have to get cleaned up

08:42.360 --> 08:45.011
before we spend five hours
in a car together. Yeah.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.124
Five hours? Where we going?

09:03.600 --> 09:04.647
O Canada.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.290
That is a big house.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.450
It's a family home. Asa's just a guy.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.729
Jody!

09:37.760 --> 09:40.923
Oh, Jody, thanks for coming.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.001
Loraine. Of course. How you holding up?

09:44.320 --> 09:49.565
Well, it's a house full of loud,
drunk hunters

09:50.520 --> 09:52.966
and my son's dead body is in the parlor,

09:54.840 --> 09:56.569
but I haven't slit my wrists yet.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.526
Small victories.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.364
We're very sorry for your loss.

10:03.800 --> 10:04.847
I know.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.205
Everyone's sorry.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.524
So, this is gonna be fun.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.728
No label. Well, that's a red flag.

10:21.880 --> 10:25.680
No, fully safe. I home brewed it myself.
Here. Not a twist-off.

10:25.880 --> 10:26.881
Oh.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.730
I hope you like a strong beer, buddy.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.081
- No, that's good.
- Yeah?

10:35.320 --> 10:36.367
Uh, Dean Winchester.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.280
The Dean Winchester?

10:38.480 --> 10:39.891
No freaking way.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.249
Aren't you dead, like, four times?

10:43.280 --> 10:44.850
Yeah, it didn't take.

10:45.080 --> 10:48.163
Wait, your brother here? Sam?

10:48.520 --> 10:50.249
Yeah, yeah. He's still alive, too. He's...

10:52.400 --> 10:54.289
- Okay. Good talk.
- Yeah, sorry about Elvis,

10:54.480 --> 10:56.130
he's Elvis.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.771
- I'm Bucky Sims.
- Hey.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.008
Yeah. Randy. Randy Bull.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.328
- Watch out for the horns, right?
- Yeah.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.204
- You two hunters?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.166
Yes, sir. Did you know Asa?

11:08.640 --> 11:12.725
No, no. I never met him.
But, uh, heard some crazy stories.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.481
Yeah, like what?

11:18.760 --> 11:21.206
Well, I mean, come on, nobody can take out
five Wendigos in a night...

11:21.400 --> 11:24.449
Hey! Our famous friend
said the magic word! Drink, everybody!

11:27.320 --> 11:29.482
- "Wendigo"? Is that the...
- Do it again!

11:31.240 --> 11:32.321
Okay.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.242
Stop saying that
or we're not gonna make it to morning.

11:38.440 --> 11:39.487
Didn't know the rules.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.091
If you think the stories
about Asa are crazy,

11:41.240 --> 11:42.480
you should hear what they say about you.

11:44.280 --> 11:48.808
Wait, so you guys were raised by a witch,
but you're hunters?

11:49.120 --> 11:52.249
- Yep.
- Yep. She was, like, a good witch.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.283
Very Enya. It was the '90s.

11:54.520 --> 11:55.726
Lot of crystals.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.640
She taught me to hunt witches.
Bad witches.

11:58.840 --> 12:00.649
SAM: Sure. What did she teach you?

12:01.280 --> 12:03.487
Uh, mostly how to seduce men.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.006
She also taught him some magic
which is actually more useful.

12:07.280 --> 12:09.647
- Ah, mostly the men thing.
- Max.

12:10.920 --> 12:13.571
Are you Sam Winchester?
You are, right?

12:14.360 --> 12:16.283
This is nuts. Wow, hi.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.448
- Hey.
- Elvis Katz.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.289
Wow, look, so, the thing is,

12:21.440 --> 12:23.169
I got this friend
down in the States, right?

12:23.320 --> 12:26.051
Who knows this girl
who knew your pal, Garth?

12:26.200 --> 12:27.326
- Garth, yeah.
- And well...

12:27.520 --> 12:31.366
He said that she said that Garth said that
you were possessed by the Devil.

12:31.720 --> 12:35.884
Like, Lucifer, the actual big bad Devil,
and you lived.

12:36.440 --> 12:37.851
BOTH: Whoa!

12:38.760 --> 12:40.967
Dude, you don't just ask someone
about something that messed up.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.924
Seriously, back off.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.082
But it's pretty amazing, huh?

12:46.720 --> 12:49.121
No, it's really not that amazing.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.049
It's just kind of is what it is.

12:51.320 --> 12:52.321
Um...

12:53.960 --> 12:56.691
I'm gonna get a beer. Yeah. You good?
Yeah? Good.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.686
So, what's your guys' deal?

13:05.040 --> 13:08.931
Could you, like, go away from us now?

13:17.120 --> 13:18.201
Hey.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.963
Oh, hey. This is a real angel blade.
I mean, this guy was legit.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.760
Did you know people tell stories about us?

13:26.040 --> 13:28.407
Yeah. Apparently,
we're a little bit legendary.

13:29.880 --> 13:31.405
Yeah, but I mean, so was Asa.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.689
Then a hunt went bad, and he ended up
hanging from a tree, alone in the woods.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.726
He died on the job. No better way to go.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.161
<i>You really believe that?</i>

13:42.120 --> 13:43.201
Yeah, what, you don't?

13:45.560 --> 13:47.085
I mean, come on, Sam,
it's not like we're in the

13:47.240 --> 13:49.288
live-till-you're-90,
die-in-your-sleep business.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.161
This...

13:57.200 --> 13:58.326
This only ends one way.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.401
We should get back.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.009
Yeah. Oh, uh, don't say Wendigo to anyone.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.441
Thank you.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.810
And Asa made us go roller skating.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.122
Like, right after these ghouls
almost got us.

14:21.440 --> 14:24.205
So there's the three of us,
all banged up,

14:24.560 --> 14:27.962
with a ton of ironic teenagers
skating under these neon lights.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.043
- You remember this, Jody?
- Mmm-hmm.

14:30.640 --> 14:33.450
Oh, it was classic. I mean, you know,

14:33.640 --> 14:37.247
until you two snuck off
for some sweet, sweet time alone.

14:37.640 --> 14:39.165
- Ooh.
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

14:39.480 --> 14:40.970
"Sweet, sweet time alone"?

14:41.920 --> 14:42.967
With you, Jody?

14:43.600 --> 14:46.331
You didn't tell us
you were in a relationship with Asa.

14:47.640 --> 14:50.723
Uh. It was just a casual thing.
Sorry, Loraine.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.570
- Asa was always popular with the ladies.
- ELVIS: Yes, he was.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.205
MAX: <i>Our mom loved him.</i>

14:56.480 --> 14:58.767
She used to talk about him all the time.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.047
See?

15:00.480 --> 15:02.767
And, you know, I do have a life
when you guys aren't around.

15:03.880 --> 15:05.086
- Beer, anyone?
- I'm good.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.081
- Yeah.
- And here's a newsflash.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.361
Dating is hard.

15:39.160 --> 15:42.607
JODY: <i>So don't be surprised that I'd enjoy
the company of a ruggedly hot man.</i>

15:42.920 --> 15:44.206
Amen to that.

15:44.720 --> 15:45.881
MAX: <i>Yeah.</i>

15:46.360 --> 15:49.364
DEAN: <i>Well, hey, you clearly deserve
your "sweet, sweet time alone."</i>

15:49.560 --> 15:51.085
JODY: <i>Well, I mean, it wasn't very sweet.</i>

15:51.800 --> 15:54.167
DEAN: <i>It's just not how we think of you,
you know?</i>

15:54.360 --> 15:56.328
JODY: <i>Okay, 'cause that would
honestly be weird.</i>

15:56.520 --> 15:58.010
DEAN: <i>Nobody said you can't date, right?</i>

15:58.200 --> 16:01.283
- JODY: <i>That's fair.</i>
- Come on in, don't hover.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.201
JODY: Hmm?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.570
Sorry. I knocked.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.246
The door was open.

16:12.640 --> 16:13.721
Hey.

16:23.760 --> 16:24.921
MARY: What are you doing here?

16:25.120 --> 16:26.246
What are you doing here?

16:26.440 --> 16:28.920
We...
Asa was a friend of a friend.

16:29.080 --> 16:33.244
Uh, a friend of Jody's. Jody, Mary.
Mom, this is Jody Mills.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.401
- Mom?
- Mom.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.841
Wait... Your mom?

16:37.360 --> 16:38.407
Yeah.

16:38.720 --> 16:39.767
I thought you were...

16:40.960 --> 16:41.961
I was.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.126
Wow.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.126
Wow!

16:50.960 --> 16:54.442
It is so nice to meet you!

16:56.320 --> 16:57.606
Wow!

17:01.440 --> 17:04.444
I'm gonna give you guys,
um, some family time.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.040
Wow!

17:10.839 --> 17:11.965
Where have you been?

17:13.119 --> 17:14.121
All over.

17:14.440 --> 17:18.161
I, urn, went back to Lawrence
for a few days, and then...

17:18.920 --> 17:21.763
I've been using John's journal
to retrace a few things.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.803
Trying to catch up on what I've missed.

17:28.119 --> 17:29.884
You could've just asked us, you know?

17:30.200 --> 17:31.770
- Dean, come on.
- She could've.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.928
It's okay, he's right, but...

17:36.720 --> 17:38.643
This is something I needed to do alone.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.241
Listen.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.804
Most of the people I knew are dead.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.240
And then I remembered Asa.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.409
He was so young when I met him.
I thought he must still be around.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.281
And then...

17:56.360 --> 17:59.648
I saw an article about his death, and...

18:00.320 --> 18:02.448
So you'll text us once a week, maybe,

18:02.680 --> 18:05.047
but you drive all the way to Canada
to see some dead guy?

18:07.760 --> 18:09.046
Uh, that's awesome.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.206
I'm gonna get some air.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.091
Dean, wait.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.206
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.730
- You okay?
- Swell.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.241
Huh.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.568
Is that why you spent
the entire ride up here telling me

18:24.760 --> 18:27.730
in extreme, excruciating detail,
how you killed Hitler,

18:27.960 --> 18:32.522
but you neglected to mention the fact
that your mom is back from the dead?

18:34.360 --> 18:36.089
- No big deal.
- That's a lie.

18:36.440 --> 18:39.205
- Jody...
- Look, maybe this isn't my place

18:39.880 --> 18:41.450
and this is epic stuff.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.691
But, you know,

18:45.200 --> 18:48.647
if I could have my son
and my husband back, I mean...

18:50.080 --> 18:51.206
Really back...

18:53.200 --> 18:56.807
I would give anything,
absolutely anything to have that.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.770
And it would scare the hell out of me.

19:03.840 --> 19:04.887
Yeah?

19:05.120 --> 19:06.201
Yeah.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.085
Because what if I've changed?

19:08.720 --> 19:09.767
What if they changed?

19:11.200 --> 19:13.726
What if it just didn't work out
the way I wanted?

19:16.800 --> 19:18.450
If you wanna talk about anything,

19:19.920 --> 19:22.366
absolutely anything, I'm here.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.321
Thanks, Jody.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.843
Asa's favorite. Tastes awful.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.681
I'm Loraine Fox, Asa's mom.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.647
Mary Winchester.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.526
No, you're not.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.649
<i>Asa told me about you, but...</i>

19:50.800 --> 19:52.131
You'd be my age.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.970
- So, how...
- It's a long story.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.001
I'll bet.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.371
- I'm sorry...
- You should be.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.644
Like I said, Asa told me about you.

20:08.880 --> 20:12.282
You're the reason
my son didn't become an astronaut.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.606
Astronaut?

20:17.360 --> 20:18.361
Here.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.241
Asa wrote those to you over the years,

20:22.640 --> 20:26.167
but couldn't send them
because you're so mysterious.

20:38.520 --> 20:39.851
I saved his life.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.970
What am I supposed to say to that?

20:44.960 --> 20:47.691
After you, Asa got so...

20:51.000 --> 20:53.002
Hunting was his whole life.

20:54.600 --> 20:58.002
He never married,
never had a family, kids.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.367
And now...

21:03.760 --> 21:05.046
Enjoy the wake.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.808
Hey. Everything all right?

21:18.440 --> 21:21.125
Fine. It's fine.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.447
Are you sure?

21:25.440 --> 21:27.329
I saved Asa when he was a boy.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.362
All of this, it's on me.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.890
SAM: Well, no.
Obviously, Mom, he made his own decisions.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.410
And he helped a lot of people, you know.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.161
Yeah, I don't know.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.411
I just don't know anymore.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.485
Everywhere I go,
and everything I do just...

21:47.680 --> 21:48.727
Feels wrong.

21:52.680 --> 21:55.843
But I'll get used to it.
Being back here. I will, I just...

21:56.080 --> 21:58.242
Yeah, Mom,
you don't have to explain anything.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.722
I get it. You need space,

22:00.920 --> 22:03.605
and so does Dean, you know.
I mean, he's just...

22:06.200 --> 22:07.247
We just got you back,

22:07.400 --> 22:09.880
<i>and he's just scared
we're gonna lose you again.</i>

22:10.040 --> 22:12.771
<i>That because we're hunters,
you're gonna walk</i> away.

22:14.840 --> 22:17.286
But I know that's not true.
Even looking at these...

22:18.720 --> 22:21.724
I mean, you saved Asa in 1980,

22:22.040 --> 22:23.849
um, after Dean was born,

22:24.920 --> 22:27.082
after everyone thought you quit hunting.

22:28.760 --> 22:30.922
Seems like
you couldn't stop then

22:31.120 --> 22:34.044
and I'm guessing
you can't stop now either.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.968
This job, this life,

22:40.360 --> 22:42.249
it's crazy and insane

22:43.120 --> 22:45.282
but it's in our blood.

22:51.520 --> 22:52.521
Come on.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.167
Where we going?

22:54.480 --> 22:55.845
To say goodbye to Asa.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.565
And Asa loved that jeep.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.810
Fuses were shorted, fuel line was busted.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.686
Ah, he didn't care. He'd just roll up
his sleeves, he'd get right to work.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.803
Guys, we need to leave now.

23:41.520 --> 23:42.885
- Sam?
- Randy's dead.

23:43.320 --> 23:44.401
What happened?

23:44.600 --> 23:46.011
Someone gutted him
and roped him to the ceiling.

23:46.160 --> 23:47.207
That's what happened.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.084
Hey, anyone know why the water's shut off?

23:49.640 --> 23:50.801
God, what's that smell?

23:51.840 --> 23:52.841
Sulfur.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.406
- It's a demon.
- Yeah.

23:58.080 --> 23:59.161
- It's him.
- "Him"?

23:59.320 --> 24:00.970
Jael. He's a crossroads demon.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.651
All right, he hangs people,
it's his thing.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.411
Snaps their necks, slits their throat,
he's a real piece of work.

24:05.600 --> 24:06.840
Hanging like with Asa?

24:07.520 --> 24:08.806
Yeah, he's the one that killed him.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.611
- Son of a bitch!
- Let me.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.366
MAX: <i>You're wasting your time.</i>

24:25.040 --> 24:27.407
The whole house has been warded.
Inside and out.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.045
- What does that mean?
- ALICIA: <i>It means we're trapped.</i>

24:37.440 --> 24:39.568
- Go away.
- BILLIE: <i>You're not the boss of me.</i>

24:41.560 --> 24:44.291
Billie. What are you doing here?

24:44.520 --> 24:45.521
My job.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.240
Well, I'm not dead yet.

24:48.560 --> 24:49.641
Shame.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.169
But actually, I just finished inside.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.565
I was reaping a fresh soul.

25:00.280 --> 25:01.691
Look, back in '97,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.082
Asa was working this case
in Yellowknife, all right?

25:04.320 --> 25:05.845
Possession of a First Nations girl.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.241
It got real bad, real bloody.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.761
- Was it, uh, Jael?
- Asa exorcised him,

25:10.160 --> 25:11.969
but not before Jael killed the girl.

25:12.320 --> 25:15.403
He made her tie a noose around her neck.
He made Asa watch.

25:16.840 --> 25:19.161
Sam. Sammy! Hey!

25:19.400 --> 25:22.449
You can huff and puff, but that house
is on supernatural lockdown.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.291
<i>They can't even hear you.</i>

25:24.680 --> 25:26.967
All right, look, an exorcism,
it ain't like an angel blade.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.804
- Yeah, it's not permanent.
- <i>Exactly.</i>

25:29.120 --> 25:30.770
All right, so five years later,
Jael, he came back,

25:30.960 --> 25:32.610
- and he came for Asa.
- How so?

25:33.240 --> 25:35.129
Asa was seeing this woman, right?
She had a kid...

25:35.360 --> 25:36.805
- Marlene.
- Yeah, Marlene.

25:39.600 --> 25:40.647
Jael got into her...

25:41.920 --> 25:44.491
It didn't matter that he was
killing people. He wanted Asa to know.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.889
It was personal. He gets off on it.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.646
Yeah and now he's here.
Possessing someone.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.086
MARY: Yeah, but who?

25:58.440 --> 26:00.488
Alicia wasn't in the room
when Randy died.

26:00.840 --> 26:03.127
- <i>The rest of us were.</i>
- I was getting a drink.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.330
Dean wasn't in the room either.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.121
So it's Alicia or Dean.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.401
I'm not!

26:11.840 --> 26:13.808
Throw some holy water on me,
see what happens.

26:15.840 --> 26:16.887
Anybody packing?

26:17.680 --> 26:20.081
- We could just make more.
- Uh, no, we can't. The water's off.

26:21.840 --> 26:24.207
- She knew that. You knew that.
- Oh, come on.

26:25.320 --> 26:26.970
- What did you do?
- <i>Wasn't me.</i>

26:27.160 --> 26:28.321
<i>I don't get my hands dirty.</i>

26:28.840 --> 26:31.207
Rules. I just clean up the mess.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.649
Still, between us,

26:33.840 --> 26:36.525
it's always nice to see a Winchester
who can't get what he wants.

26:38.040 --> 26:42.204
You think this is funny, huh?
Hunters are dying in there!

26:42.560 --> 26:43.686
Everyone dies.

26:44.240 --> 26:45.685
I think Dean's still outside.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.843
Well, that does narrow it down.

26:55.440 --> 26:56.521
Alicia?

27:00.880 --> 27:02.291
Alicia's not here right now.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.047
Leave a message.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.048
Oh, you're a fun group.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.284
We're gonna have a good time tonight.

27:20.360 --> 27:22.408
- It's gone.
- Alicia, are you...

27:22.880 --> 27:25.565
It's not gone.
It's just not in Alicia anymore.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.010
Loraine, is there anyone
else in the house?

27:28.200 --> 27:30.441
I don't know.
People have been coming and going all day.

27:30.680 --> 27:32.887
Okay, we're gonna pair off,
we're gonna search the house.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.405
For people, not for demons.

27:35.240 --> 27:38.926
If you find a demon, yell, we'll find you.
And if your partner gets possessed, run.

27:39.320 --> 27:40.367
Mom.

27:41.880 --> 27:42.927
Stay here.

27:47.680 --> 27:48.681
You got in.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.484
You got in to reap that soul,
you can get me in.

27:51.640 --> 27:54.291
- I mean, I could. I suppose, but...
- Do it!

27:54.760 --> 27:58.481
But it's a one-way ticket,
and you're gonna owe me one.

28:00.320 --> 28:02.322
- I got you a double.
- Mmm.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.041
Holy...

28:16.920 --> 28:17.967
Where's my brother?

28:18.400 --> 28:20.880
- Hey, hold up, how did you...
- He's the demon!

28:21.120 --> 28:22.281
- Demon?
- Kill him!

28:22.520 --> 28:23.681
Whoa, whoa. Easy, lady.

28:23.920 --> 28:26.002
Look, I'm not a demon, okay?
I'm one of the good guys.

28:26.240 --> 28:28.481
Now stick with me, do what I say,
and everybody will get out of here,

28:28.680 --> 28:29.681
okay? Everybody.

28:29.920 --> 28:30.921
Well...

28:32.680 --> 28:33.727
Not everybody.

28:48.600 --> 28:50.204
You're kind of slow for a demon,
aren't you?

28:50.640 --> 28:55.567
Careful now, you'll hurt
my feelings. Then I might lash out.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.161
How about you go to Hell.

29:02.360 --> 29:05.091
Please. It's a complete
train wreck down there.

29:05.680 --> 29:09.241
No Lucifer, no Crowley. It's messy.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.242
No, I mean, really. Go to Hell.

29:19.040 --> 29:21.088
Exorcism? Uh-uh.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.251
Elvis is leaving the building.

29:34.760 --> 29:36.808
Come on. Come on, come on.

29:37.880 --> 29:38.881
DEAN: Sammy!

29:39.240 --> 29:40.241
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.282
- Dean? We thought you were outside.
- Yeah, I got back in.

29:43.480 --> 29:44.527
- How?
- It's a one-time deal,

29:44.720 --> 29:46.165
it won't happen again. Is this everybody?

29:46.360 --> 29:47.407
Except for Elvis.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.401
Yeah, demon got him.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.964
Well, at least, we're all prepared.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.041
Yep.

30:01.760 --> 30:04.730
- Impressive.
- Demon blade. Kills them dead.

30:04.920 --> 30:06.570
- BOTH: Nice.
- We gotta light some candles.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.006
Yeah. A Devil's Trap.

30:08.280 --> 30:09.406
- On it.
- DEAN: Yep.

30:12.240 --> 30:15.449
All right, uh, but how are we
gonna lure it inside?

30:17.000 --> 30:19.685
We're not. We get in.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.401
Everybody's in, everybody's clean.
If someone won't, get in...

30:24.560 --> 30:25.925
- They're the demon.
- That's right.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.247
Smart.

30:27.880 --> 30:29.086
Thanks.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.044
What kind of a Devil's Trap?

30:51.840 --> 30:53.922
Standard pentagram. Nothing fancy.

30:54.720 --> 30:58.805
I like a Fifth Pentacle of Mars.
It's got more character.

30:59.280 --> 31:01.442
Because character
is what really matters right now.

31:13.800 --> 31:14.881
Sam.

31:15.960 --> 31:19.123
This is awkward, I'm owning that,
but the demon...

31:19.840 --> 31:21.080
I think it's in your mom.

31:24.040 --> 31:25.451
<i>She looks okay to me.</i>

31:26.880 --> 31:30.327
I may not know much, but I know that
people don't look possessed.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.610
No, I saw her sneak out of the room

31:33.800 --> 31:35.404
when you started talking
about the Devil's Trap.

31:35.600 --> 31:36.601
Where did she go?

31:37.800 --> 31:40.280
I mean, I know she's family, but Sam.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.407
What's going on?

31:46.160 --> 31:47.321
Uh...

31:47.800 --> 31:49.564
- Jody thinks that Mom...
- No, I don't think.

31:49.840 --> 31:52.810
I know! I know she's a demon!

31:54.600 --> 31:56.682
- Hey.
- Kill her! Use the knife!

31:56.920 --> 31:58.888
- Kill her now!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait!

32:00.160 --> 32:02.208
Hold on a second. Jody, you...

32:03.840 --> 32:05.080
You don't sound like yourself.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.211
It's because she's not herself.

32:08.760 --> 32:09.807
Are you?

32:16.040 --> 32:17.849
Can't blame a girl for trying.

32:27.840 --> 32:30.684
I so hoped you'd kill your mom!

32:31.320 --> 32:32.446
<i>Wouldn't that be a riot?</i>

32:32.720 --> 32:33.767
Yeah, super fun.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.086
Anybody else?

32:47.040 --> 32:48.087
No?

32:49.720 --> 32:50.767
Fine.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.565
- No, Mom!
- What are you doing?

32:54.760 --> 32:56.000
She's a demon, we kill demons.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.890
- No, she's Jody.
- Boring!

33:04.640 --> 33:08.008
I've heard so many stories
about you Winchesters.

33:09.400 --> 33:14.770
And I desperately want
the Lucifer thing to be true.

33:15.160 --> 33:22.123
The idea that he left a meat suit alive
is just so deliciously weak.

33:25.280 --> 33:29.763
As for the rest of you,
I have been inside your heads.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.766
I know all about you!

33:33.920 --> 33:38.323
For example, the twins,
too frightened to tell anyone

33:38.560 --> 33:42.201
that they actually came
to say goodbye to their daddy.

33:48.040 --> 33:52.489
Or the grieving mother who hated the fact
that her son was a hunter so much,

33:52.680 --> 33:55.286
she'd hide his gear,
she'd sabotage his jeep,

33:55.480 --> 33:58.211
anything to keep him from hunting!

33:59.000 --> 34:00.126
Not that it worked.

34:01.440 --> 34:02.726
<i>Could have tried harder, huh?</i>

34:04.600 --> 34:09.969
And this meat suit
you all seem to care so much about,

34:10.120 --> 34:13.010
she actually fantasized
about a life with Asa!

34:13.199 --> 34:16.123
Can you believe that?
Like that worthless man...

34:16.320 --> 34:18.083
- Shut your filthy mouth!
- And you!

34:20.960 --> 34:22.121
JODY: <i>Bucky.</i>

34:22.800 --> 34:25.041
Brave, brave Bucky.

34:26.159 --> 34:27.525
I was there that night.

34:28.320 --> 34:31.164
<i>Tell these nice,
stupid people what you did.</i>

34:31.600 --> 34:33.887
<i>Tell them what you took from me.</i>

34:34.480 --> 34:37.005
Asa was mine.

34:39.840 --> 34:40.920
No!

34:46.800 --> 34:47.801
Tell them!

34:54.400 --> 34:56.801
I killed him! I killed him. I killed Asa.

35:15.560 --> 35:17.210
Jody. Are you okay?

35:18.960 --> 35:21.486
That sucked.

35:26.720 --> 35:28.609
Bucky, what did you do?

35:43.200 --> 35:44.247
BUCKY: <i>Asa, he was just all...</i>

35:46.320 --> 35:47.845
He was just always so stubborn.

35:50.360 --> 35:53.284
Look. We were in the woods.

35:58.680 --> 36:00.284
<i>Jael, he was taunting him.</i>

36:02.160 --> 36:05.004
Asa wanted to chase him,
but he didn't have the angel blade.

36:06.480 --> 36:07.720
I said, "Let's go back."

36:09.080 --> 36:10.286
<i>He called me a coward.</i>

36:10.600 --> 36:12.921
<i>Shoved me, so I shoved him back.</i>

36:13.440 --> 36:15.727
<i>He fell and he hit his head.</i>

36:16.560 --> 36:17.800
<i>I didn't mean to do it but...</i>

36:18.160 --> 36:20.925
<i>It was a mistake. An accident.</i>

36:21.920 --> 36:23.081
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

36:24.320 --> 36:25.606
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

36:30.040 --> 36:32.327
Asa hated that damn demon
so much that I just...

36:32.480 --> 36:34.608
But you thought that people
would buy that Jael killed him.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.961
So you hung your best friend
to cover your own ass.

36:49.960 --> 36:51.200
What are you gonna do to me?

36:54.880 --> 36:55.961
ALICIA: <i>Tell everyone.</i>

36:57.000 --> 36:59.651
Every hunter we meet,
they're gonna know your name, Bucky.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.481
<i>Know what you did.</i>

37:01.680 --> 37:02.681
MAX: <i>You like stories.</i>

37:02.960 --> 37:06.487
This is the story
everyone's gonna tell about you. Forever.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.326
I was wrong.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.531
Asa did have a family.

37:36.960 --> 37:38.121
He even had kids.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.046
I've got grandchildren.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.085
I suppose I should go meet them.

37:54.400 --> 37:55.526
Sorry.

37:57.120 --> 37:59.521
Oh, I've had worse.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.681
I don't know what's going on
between you and your boys,

38:11.840 --> 38:13.729
but I got to tell you, mom to mom,

38:15.200 --> 38:16.361
they're good men.

38:17.480 --> 38:18.720
Best I've ever met.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.326
I know.

38:25.560 --> 38:26.800
They're not the problem.

38:48.480 --> 38:49.561
Mom.

38:50.440 --> 38:51.566
Are you okay?

38:52.040 --> 38:53.565
She's really not.

38:55.320 --> 38:56.321
Billie.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.207
MARY: Who's...

38:59.000 --> 39:00.126
She's a Reaper.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.090
She's the one that got me back inside.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.291
And now you owe me one.

39:07.080 --> 39:08.241
This one.

39:09.480 --> 39:10.686
This one right here.

39:12.680 --> 39:13.761
What?

39:13.960 --> 39:17.760
See, I'm a big believer in what dies,
stays dead.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.602
Laws of the universe, and all that, so...

39:21.160 --> 39:22.605
I didn't ask to come back here.

39:23.080 --> 39:24.286
No, you didn't.

39:25.080 --> 39:26.161
And you hate it.

39:27.680 --> 39:30.331
The look in your eyes,
I've seen it before.

39:31.480 --> 39:33.050
It's a dead man's look.

39:34.040 --> 39:36.805
Eyes that say no matter
where you go, what you do,

39:37.000 --> 39:40.288
it feels like this world
doesn't fit anymore.

39:42.280 --> 39:43.566
Like you're all alone.

39:43.760 --> 39:44.841
Well, she's not alone.

39:46.760 --> 39:47.886
Tell me I'm wrong.

39:56.920 --> 39:58.206
I'm not here to hurt you,

39:59.320 --> 40:00.890
<i>I'm hereto offer you mercy.</i>

40:01.800 --> 40:05.327
One-way ticket upstairs.
Away from all of this.

40:12.080 --> 40:13.161
How would it work?

40:13.440 --> 40:15.408
- Mom.
- Do you just kill me again?

40:16.800 --> 40:18.131
Reapers don't kill people.

40:19.280 --> 40:20.406
Rules.

40:24.840 --> 40:25.841
Well...

40:27.400 --> 40:28.401
Then...

40:37.520 --> 40:39.602
Then I guess
you're just gonna have to wait.

40:44.320 --> 40:45.651
Winchesters.

40:49.400 --> 40:52.722
If you change your mind,
if any of you change your minds,

40:53.440 --> 40:54.680
you know my name.

41:02.080 --> 41:03.366
Does this mean you're coming home?

41:06.200 --> 41:07.690
Yeah.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.329
Not quite yet.
I just need a little more time.

41:16.320 --> 41:17.765
Can we buy you breakfast at least?

41:20.320 --> 41:21.890
- Bacon?
- All the bacon.

41:25.560 --> 41:26.891
I would love that.
