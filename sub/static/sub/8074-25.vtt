00:03.737 --> 00:09.477
[music playing]

00:09.510 --> 00:10.444
Hey, everybody.

00:10.478 --> 00:11.345
Thanks for coming.

00:11.379 --> 00:12.346
What's up, Dad?

00:12.380 --> 00:13.414
Why'd you call us?

00:13.447 --> 00:14.882
Well, we just got
back from the doctors,

00:14.915 --> 00:17.118
and I wanted to talk to you all
about your mom and the baby.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.252
Something wrong?

00:18.286 --> 00:19.620
No, no.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.189
Oh, man, I bet she's going
to do one of those home birth

00:21.222 --> 00:24.292
deals and we all have to watch.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.060
No, it's not that, it's just--

00:29.663 --> 00:31.065
Roseanne is pregnant.

00:31.099 --> 00:35.569
Dan, we knew that.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.638
Yeah, maybe the
doctor didn't know.

00:37.671 --> 00:42.343
You know, maybe uh, he thought
she was just, you know, big.

00:42.376 --> 00:46.414
No, see the problem is
Roseanne is still pregnant

00:46.447 --> 00:49.049
and she will be for
another couple of months.

00:49.083 --> 00:53.053
(ANGRILY) When the hell
are we going to get a gun?

00:53.087 --> 00:55.156
She's not real happy about it.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.458
Well, Beck, those cinder
blocks behind our trailer,

00:57.491 --> 00:58.826
they ain't gonna
stack themselves so--

00:58.859 --> 01:01.028
Sit down, Mark.

01:01.061 --> 01:05.065
Now, Mrs. Conner's going through
something called "nesting."

01:05.099 --> 01:07.000
See, pregnant women
always want to make

01:07.034 --> 01:09.403
their homes as comfortable
as possible for the new baby.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.939
All right, I got
jobs for you people.

01:11.972 --> 01:14.442
Do what you're told,
you won't get hurt.

01:14.475 --> 01:17.010
Although, in Mrs. Conner's
case her role is mostly

01:17.044 --> 01:18.279
supervisory.

01:18.312 --> 01:21.315
Say, we need to fix this
place for the new baby,

01:21.349 --> 01:22.516
it's a pigsty.

01:22.550 --> 01:25.052
And this baby is used to
four star accommodations.

01:25.085 --> 01:28.556
You've done a great job
of keeping it up, honey.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.525
Shut up, Dan.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.694
All right, I want fresh
flowers in every window--

01:33.727 --> 01:34.628
Mark, that's for you.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.530
Well, what kind of flowers?

01:36.564 --> 01:39.333
Green on one end and
colored on the other.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.404
We need new shelf paper.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.005
Becky, you're really good
at not dropping stuff,

01:45.038 --> 01:46.974
so that's yours.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.876
Vacuuming and
dusting, that's DJ.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.411
Aw, man, why me?

01:50.444 --> 01:54.948
Because I don't care
about vacuuming and dusting.

01:54.982 --> 01:57.185
And then we need some
healthy stuff around here.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.253
Fruits and vegetables,
Jackie, that's for you.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.488
Got it.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.290
And you might as well
pick me up some instructions

02:02.323 --> 02:05.659
on how to cook those things.

02:05.693 --> 02:10.130
And then I want the whole
place to smell better, Dan.

02:10.164 --> 02:10.964
David.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.837
Well I guess maybe I
could simmer a little spring

02:16.870 --> 02:18.105
rain potpourri in diffuser.

02:21.542 --> 02:24.712
Okey dokey.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.880
Dad, you've got a
registered letter.

02:26.914 --> 02:30.117
Oh my god, no, Dan, not
any bad news, not now.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.118
Oh, you're right.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.987
This is a very bad
time for bad news.

02:34.021 --> 02:34.988
We can open this later.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.690
It's probably just
my seed catalog.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.426
Anyway, hon, you were
giving out instructions--

02:38.459 --> 02:39.327
Gimme that.

02:39.360 --> 02:43.697
Hmm-- hmm.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.666
Oh, my god.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.636
Whatever it is, baby, we
can get through it together.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.138
Or I could bear the brunt of it.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.874
We've been picked to
be a Nielsen family.

02:53.907 --> 02:57.278
Oh, Roseanne!

02:57.311 --> 02:59.247
Oh, that's so much power.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.716
Oh, it is, man, and
I am ready for it, too,

03:02.750 --> 03:04.184
I'll tell you what.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.754
Two weeks from now you're
going to see Bryant Gumbel

03:06.787 --> 03:08.956
spinning plates in Vegas.

03:08.989 --> 03:12.893
[theme music]

03:50.831 --> 03:52.800
[roseanne laughs]

03:52.833 --> 03:56.770
[music playing]

03:56.804 --> 04:00.408
Alrighty, Mr. and Mrs.
Conner, you are all hooked up.

04:00.441 --> 04:03.444
As of this moment you are
officially a Nielsen Family.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.645
Do you hear that?

04:04.678 --> 04:08.148
We are smack dab in the
white hot center of showbiz.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.384
Oh, boy.

04:10.418 --> 04:13.020
For the next year,
that box will monitor

04:13.053 --> 04:14.655
everything your family watches.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.325
And your viewing habits
will affect the lives

04:17.358 --> 04:18.659
of millions of other people.

04:18.692 --> 04:23.797
Man, this must be what
it feels like to vote.

04:23.831 --> 04:26.767
Now, I just want to verify
some of the answers you

04:26.800 --> 04:28.168
put here on your questionnaire.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.938
I see that you both
graduated from high school,

04:30.971 --> 04:32.205
but did either of
you go to college?

04:32.239 --> 04:33.173
No.

04:33.206 --> 04:36.510
No, but we did
egg a college once.

04:36.544 --> 04:37.578
And your children?

04:37.611 --> 04:38.712
Sat in the car.

04:38.746 --> 04:42.416
No, no, no.

04:42.450 --> 04:45.152
It's just, I see two of
them are at least 18.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.286
Did they graduate high school?

04:46.320 --> 04:47.154
No.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.188
David graduated.

04:48.221 --> 04:51.124
That's right, ha ha ha.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.561
Oh, but he's not our kid.

04:53.594 --> 04:57.197
He lives in the basement.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.533
Came with the house.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.535
Why you gotta
ask all this stuff?

05:01.569 --> 05:03.437
Well, the advertisers
not only like

05:03.471 --> 05:05.539
to know how many people
watch certain programs,

05:05.573 --> 05:08.175
but also what type
of people they are.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.276
Uh-huh.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.712
And, uh, what type
of people are we?

05:11.745 --> 05:14.582
Oh, you're a fine,
fine type of people.

05:14.615 --> 05:17.351
Like many of the people from
this type of neighborhood.

05:17.385 --> 05:21.389
Large households, modest
income, required education only.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.525
Dan, he's calling us stupid.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.827
[laughter]

05:26.860 --> 05:29.162
He is?

05:29.196 --> 05:33.501
Look, if there's a problem
we can just call this off.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.403
No, I want to be
a Nielsen Family.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.170
Our whole lives have been
building towards this.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.906
Good.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.041
Thank you so much
for participating.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.410
If you have any
questions, there's

05:42.443 --> 05:45.045
an 800 number behind the box--
that means the call's free.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.948
Yeah, we know what it means.

05:47.981 --> 05:51.785
Anyway, just go on
doing what you're doing,

05:51.819 --> 05:53.521
watch TV like you always do.

05:53.554 --> 05:57.124
If that means all the
time, consider it done.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.692
Great.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.628
Hot dog!

06:00.661 --> 06:03.931
Time to down a sixer and help
shape the culture of America.

06:03.964 --> 06:07.334
Do you believe that, Dan,
they think we're dumb heads.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.638
They just want to hook up
some poor uneducated slobs

06:10.671 --> 06:12.640
so the country has somebody
to blame "America's

06:12.673 --> 06:14.508
Funniest Home Videos" on.

06:14.542 --> 06:17.811
So what, they're paying
us $0.13 cents a week.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.680
See that little
box there, Dan?

06:19.713 --> 06:22.850
That there Nielsen
box is a conspiracy.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.885
Yeah, that's what you
said when they added

06:24.918 --> 06:28.321
blue diamonds to Lucky Charms.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.791
No, see, they want to
make sure that people like

06:30.824 --> 06:34.995
us watch crap like tractor pulls
and "Jerry Springer," you know.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.964
So the advertisers can
sell us all this stuff

06:36.997 --> 06:38.331
that we don't really need.

06:38.365 --> 06:40.033
And then they take our
money, and they give it

06:40.067 --> 06:42.503
to these right wing,
Washington politicians

06:42.536 --> 06:44.404
that cut school lunches, and
all these other budget cuts,

06:44.438 --> 06:45.539
you know.

06:45.573 --> 06:48.275
To make sure that people
like us have no choice

06:48.308 --> 06:50.978
but to stay people like us.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.880
And who the hell wants to be us.

06:58.185 --> 07:02.022
Can we still watch "Montel"?

07:02.055 --> 07:03.591
No!

07:03.624 --> 07:05.826
We are not going to
watch nothing but PBS

07:05.859 --> 07:08.228
and the Discovery Channel
and that other smart crap.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.231
We'll show them.

07:11.264 --> 07:15.636
I understand they've got
news on every day at 6:00.

07:15.669 --> 07:19.306
[music playing]

07:20.508 --> 07:23.243
I'll tell you what,
$5 bucks on the winner.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.745
I don't like to
bet on these things.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.146
Come on, it'll make
it more interesting.

07:26.179 --> 07:29.082
OK, I'll take the big one.

07:29.116 --> 07:33.153
Soccer, a wolf
fighting a moose?

07:33.186 --> 07:34.221
That's no contest.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.956
How come we're not
watching the Bulls?

07:35.989 --> 07:39.727
I told you he was a sucker
for the Nature Program.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.362
Come on Roseanne, the guys
are going to be over here soon

07:42.395 --> 07:43.697
and they all want to
watch the playoffs.

07:43.731 --> 07:44.898
What are you talking about?

07:44.932 --> 07:46.600
This sudden death.

07:46.634 --> 07:49.737
And they are fighting back.

07:49.770 --> 07:53.006
Keep your head down.

07:53.040 --> 07:56.143
Use your antlers for god's sake!

07:56.176 --> 07:58.178
Protecting it's young.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.580
Fixed!

07:59.613 --> 08:01.248
Idiot!

08:01.281 --> 08:04.585
Stupidest moose
in North America.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.086
All right, good he's dead.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.021
Now can we turn on the game?

08:08.055 --> 08:10.223
Or do we still have to try
to impress Nielsen guy?

08:10.257 --> 08:12.092
Hey, it's not
just for him, Dan.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.562
I want a better
environment for our kid.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.896
Look at the other
three kids we got

08:15.929 --> 08:17.297
off of watching Wrestlemania.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.633
Do we really have
anything to lose?

08:19.667 --> 08:20.968
Fine.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.637
When the kid's six we'll start
watching the brainy crap.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.438
I happen to know that
kids five and under

08:25.472 --> 08:28.709
enjoy the same programs as me.

08:28.742 --> 08:29.977
No, Dan.

08:30.010 --> 08:36.216
Oh, your lips say "no,"
but your eyes, they say--

08:39.352 --> 08:42.623
how about that, your
eyes say "no," too.

08:42.656 --> 08:45.292
If you want to watch the
game go over to Fred's.

08:45.325 --> 08:50.063
But don't blame me if we
grow apart intellectually.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.899
All right.

08:51.932 --> 08:55.302
Not as much fun as
watching with you.

08:55.335 --> 08:58.405
I'll try to get by.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.774
I would rather not
have Dan and his friends

09:00.808 --> 09:01.775
over at my house.
- Why?

09:01.809 --> 09:03.176
You don't have to
worry about Dan.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.880
He just got a new flea and tick
collar and he just got wormed.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.382
Not me, it's Fred.

09:09.416 --> 09:14.054
Fred, Fred, Fred,
Fred, Fred, Fred.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.756
You know how he can be.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.791
Or do you have to
spend 341 days with him

09:17.825 --> 09:20.060
to understand what I mean?

09:20.093 --> 09:22.195
I'll call the
guys from Fred's.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.297
Enjoy yourselves ladies.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.867
I'm off to spend
time with a dumb TV.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.838
You can't go.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.673
Why not?

09:32.706 --> 09:34.742
They've-- they've
renamed all the streets,

09:34.775 --> 09:35.575
you'll never find it.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.381
I think what Jackie's trying
to say is that she would

09:41.414 --> 09:44.718
rather be hung up
and bled like a hog

09:44.752 --> 09:45.886
than have you in her house.

09:48.622 --> 09:49.923
Great.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.491
Michael Jordan's
back in basketball,

09:51.524 --> 09:53.260
but William F Buckley
is live from Yale.

10:11.311 --> 10:14.281
Don't even think
about it, Dan.

10:14.314 --> 10:17.217
I'm quicker than I look.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.619
Let's play keep-away.

10:19.653 --> 10:22.289
Like with Mom and her Midol.

10:26.894 --> 10:27.828
Oh!

10:27.861 --> 10:30.263
[yelp]

10:35.869 --> 10:38.005
So much for that
family of kittens.

10:42.843 --> 10:46.613
[music playing]

10:49.616 --> 10:52.585
Hello, it's a surprise
visit from your mother.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.654
Are you shocked?

10:54.688 --> 10:56.790
Well my pulse just
dropped severely

10:56.824 --> 10:58.558
and all my systems are
starting to shut down.

10:58.591 --> 11:01.895
So yeah, I think that is shock.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.497
I was doing a little
redecorating, digging

11:04.531 --> 11:06.566
through some old things.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.369
And I thought perhaps
you might like

11:09.402 --> 11:14.107
to have your old baby quilt.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.976
Thanks.

11:16.009 --> 11:19.312
Well actually though, that's
the quilt the dog died on.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.982
Hello, ladies.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.051
Beverley.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.252
What are you doing?

11:25.285 --> 11:26.553
I'm going to fix the couch.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.021
When I get done it'll
be as good as new.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.724
This couch is
pretty old and ratty.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.292
Why didn't you
just throw it out?

11:32.325 --> 11:34.327
Well, around here we
don't throw things out just

11:34.361 --> 11:35.328
'cause they're old and ratty.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.103
I mean, hell, they can be
old and ratty and annoying

11:43.136 --> 11:45.538
and we still keep them around.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.340
Oh, I see.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.277
Well, perhaps I should just go.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.813
You know, since I'm
redecorating I was

11:52.846 --> 11:54.214
gonna offer you my old sofa.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.615
Oh, that'll be great.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.684
But maybe I shouldn't.

11:57.717 --> 12:02.155
Perhaps that's the kind of
thing you find annoying.

12:02.189 --> 12:06.093
You're not annoying, Mom,
when you're giving us stuff.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.195
Can I talk to
you in the kitchen?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.863
No, I don't
remember telling you

12:09.897 --> 12:12.032
you could talk to me
in the living room.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.234
Excuse us, Bev.

12:14.267 --> 12:17.404
If you don't want it I'll
donate it to my theater group,

12:17.437 --> 12:19.773
they're doing Fiddler.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.708
We are not taking her couch.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.610
I can just as easily fix ours.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.112
But she's right, Dan.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.914
Our couch is ugly
and I want our baby

12:26.947 --> 12:28.615
to grow up in a nice house.

12:28.648 --> 12:31.651
Or at least our house
with nice stuff in it.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.653
Or at least our house
with crappy stuff

12:33.686 --> 12:35.956
in it and one nice couch.

12:35.989 --> 12:40.293
Honey, you do this every
time we have of a new baby.

12:40.327 --> 12:43.696
With Becky you
wanted new wallpaper.

12:43.730 --> 12:46.666
Darlene, you wanted to
get rid of the carpeting.

12:46.699 --> 12:49.369
With DJ, you wanted
to get rid of Darlene.

12:49.402 --> 12:52.172
See, and I'm always right.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.841
I don't want to
take this couch

12:53.874 --> 12:54.942
and be more indebted to Bev.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.110
It's bad enough we took
that 10,000 from her.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.346
Oh, come on that was
over three years ago.

12:59.379 --> 13:02.649
She has eaten dinner here at
least five times since then.

13:02.682 --> 13:07.087
And one of them times was
shrimp, so, she owes us.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.790
[music playing]

13:12.092 --> 13:14.895
Uh, Mom's not coming over
with the couch, is she?

13:14.928 --> 13:16.930
No, she won't ride in
the back of the truck

13:16.964 --> 13:19.900
and Dan won't let her
sit on all of his maps.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.468
Just in case she
does come over,

13:21.501 --> 13:23.871
don't tell her about me
and Fred being in therapy.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.673
You don't have to
worry about it, Jackie.

13:26.706 --> 13:27.507
I already told her.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.278
How is that therapy
going anyway?

13:31.311 --> 13:34.547
I'm sick of it.

13:34.581 --> 13:38.785
All this talk about feelings
and boundaries and validations.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.788
Last week we learned that Fred
needs me to wash the dishes

13:41.821 --> 13:42.990
before they go in
the dishwasher,

13:43.023 --> 13:45.425
because his sister threw
his tricycle in the gully.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.764
Now, why don't you
give yourself a break.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.266
You know just forget
about therapy and all

13:53.300 --> 13:54.467
of your problems,
and go home or fix

13:54.501 --> 13:56.069
some romantic type of dinner.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.938
I don't know.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.439
Telling you it really works.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.773
Works for me and Dan.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.709
There is not a man
alive who won't

14:02.742 --> 14:07.614
fall madly in love with you
after a fried bologna sandwich.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.182
Rosie, we got it.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.753
OK, so where do you want it?

14:13.786 --> 14:16.723
Um, let's see,
balanced on the banister.

14:16.756 --> 14:19.259
No, in the same place
the other couch was.

14:19.292 --> 14:23.430
Oh, it looks great.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.532
It's surprisingly
comfortable for something

14:25.565 --> 14:28.101
made entirely of lead.

14:28.135 --> 14:29.369
I gotta get out of here.

14:29.402 --> 14:32.239
My back is killing me from
carrying that ugly thing.

14:32.272 --> 14:35.608
That's what we said when
you used to live here.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.810
You know what, I'm
going to take off.

14:37.844 --> 14:40.647
I am going to go give that
romantic dinner idea a try.

14:40.680 --> 14:41.714
Good for you.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.717
Any suggestions on
what I should wear?

14:44.751 --> 14:47.754
Weren't you listening
when I told you?

14:47.787 --> 14:50.690
Fried bologna.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.760
Ooh, looks like
everyone's gone,

14:53.793 --> 14:57.264
just me and you, and
information about Pilsners.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.966
Come join me, my pet.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.204
You sure were right
about this couch.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.439
It's comfy, it's good looking.

15:06.473 --> 15:11.111
After a couple of beers it
converts to a love seat.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.679
What's wrong?

15:12.712 --> 15:14.681
I don't like this sofa.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.450
I drove many miles in
may of herniated a disk.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.852
You love this sofa.

15:19.886 --> 15:22.255
No I don't, it
reminds me of mom.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.424
It looks like Mom, it feels
like Mom, it smells like Mom,

15:24.457 --> 15:27.494
it's just like sitting on Mom.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.996
I think you'd like that.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.316
Nah, don't work.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.883
Get it outta here.
- Are you kidding?

15:50.917 --> 15:52.752
- Burn it.
- I can't.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.987
Yeah you can.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.655
It's Mom's sofa, it'll burst
into flames if you just

15:55.688 --> 15:57.924
sprinkle some holy water on it.

15:57.957 --> 16:01.261
Rosie, you gotta calm down,
obviously it's the hormones--

16:01.294 --> 16:05.398
It is not my hormones.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.034
OK, it is a bad sofa.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.968
And now I know my mom
puts the plastic covers

16:09.002 --> 16:10.503
on it to keep the evil fresh.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.673
OK, OK, calm down, come on.

16:13.706 --> 16:16.343
We'll have it smelling
like family in no time.

16:16.376 --> 16:17.244
Come on.

16:17.277 --> 16:18.345
All right.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.246
You made me do it--

16:19.279 --> 16:21.514
I know.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.450
But it isn't my hormones.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.085
No.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.354
New couch is a big change.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.688
I mean, hell, it's
an adjustment for me

16:28.721 --> 16:30.690
and I just have tiny
insignificant guy hormones.

16:34.127 --> 16:39.799
So-- you thought of
any names for the baby?

16:39.832 --> 16:42.635
I cannot believe that
you would ask me that now.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.105
After I spend the day
grumbling to my mother,

16:45.138 --> 16:47.507
trying to save my
sister's marriage,

16:47.540 --> 16:50.177
and hauling around your
overgrown fetus inside my body.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.748
Now that was my hormones.

16:55.782 --> 16:59.586
[music playing]

17:08.995 --> 17:11.298
It's pretty easy to make.

17:11.331 --> 17:12.199
Uh huh.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.310
Can you pass the salt?

17:23.343 --> 17:24.144
Here.

17:30.950 --> 17:31.818
You want some?

17:31.851 --> 17:32.952
The potatoes are kind of blah.

17:32.985 --> 17:33.953
Nope.

17:33.986 --> 17:34.787
But, thanks.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.605

17:52.639 --> 17:53.873

Pretty good.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.537

18:24.571 --> 18:26.973
Yeah, I think so, too.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.564
What are you doing?

18:51.598 --> 18:53.233
I'm watching "The
Beverly Hillbillies,"

18:53.266 --> 18:54.601
Jethro is ciphering.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.373
I love it when he
does the gazintas.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.375
Four goes into
twelve three times,

19:02.409 --> 19:04.944
two goes into four
two times, aught

19:04.977 --> 19:07.914
goes into aught aught times.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.350
That's the one thing
about the Clampetts, Dan.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.784
No matter how much
money they got,

19:11.818 --> 19:15.455
you know, the big house, the
fancy table, the cement bond,

19:15.488 --> 19:17.190
they still love a good possum.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.326
They're true to their roots.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.228
How many of these
have you watched?

19:21.261 --> 19:22.529
All of them.

marathon in honor of Buddy

here, you miss the old sofa?

Mmm, yeah, now
I understand why

Granny made Jed build her that
little cabin out in the back.

stuff we got down in them

trying to watch now.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.568

change to that classy lifestyle

Honey, a new
couch and PBS isn't

20:06.239 --> 20:09.476
exactly Clancey lifestyle.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.311
I mean, I thought it
would be cool to change

20:11.344 --> 20:13.012
for the sake of the
baby and everything,

20:13.045 --> 20:16.683

you is 'cause you hill folk.

thine own self be true."

Well I'll be damned, that
ain't Shakespeare, is it?

one Bev gave us?

We'll put that out in the
lawn up on cinder blocks.

21:04.263 --> 21:08.335
I don't know, most folks
around here don't have

21:08.368 --> 21:10.570
a sofa on their front lawn.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.339

prideful in front

Why don't we sell that
sofa, we won't tell mom,

21:19.779 --> 21:23.750

that money on possums
