WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:02.970
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.003 --> 00:04.505
RANDALL:
This is the apartment building

00:04.538 --> 00:06.074
Beth and I bought last year.

00:06.107 --> 00:10.478
It's where I found
my biological father.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.181
BETH:
Her background is complicated.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.149
She will break you, Kevin.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.550
JASPER:
I've spoken to colleagues

00:16.584 --> 00:18.586
who have had success with IVF.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.321
At your weight, realistically,

00:20.354 --> 00:23.324
there's about a 90% chance
of failure here.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.159
You've been on
the antidepressant how long?

00:25.193 --> 00:27.428
-TOBY: Uh, six years.
-It's possible they're causing

00:27.461 --> 00:29.097
the decreased sperm count.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.165
KATE:
Dad!

00:31.199 --> 00:34.102
DOCTOR: Your husband went
into cardiac arrest.

00:34.135 --> 00:37.538
Mrs. Pearson,
your husband has died.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.859
JACK: Come on, Bec.
What's the harm in looking?

00:58.892 --> 01:02.596
Hmm. I've heard that one before.

01:02.630 --> 01:03.997
Mom?

01:05.266 --> 01:07.868
Morning.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.272
-Yeah.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.544
It's a big day today.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.613
Are we finally gonna pick a
house and get out of this place?

01:19.647 --> 01:21.149
Yeah, if it's the right house.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.016
But that's not why
it's a big day.

01:27.455 --> 01:30.191
That came for you this morning.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.267
You know, rejection letters

01:39.300 --> 01:41.969
don't typically weigh
three pounds.

01:55.015 --> 01:57.818
Ma, I... Ma, I got-I got in.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.920
-I got into Howard.
-I knew it.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.955
*

02:04.192 --> 02:07.661
Oh, baby.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.831
Mom, are

02:10.864 --> 02:13.834
Yeah, I'm good, I'm just,
I'm so happy for you.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.336
-God, get a room.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.438
Well, good morning to you, too.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.773
You know, your brother
just got into Howard.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.709
Randall, that's great.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.745
Hey, I'm sure you'll hear from
Berklee any time soon now, too.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.187
I was gonna make
a veggie omelet for us,

02:33.221 --> 02:34.455
if you want one.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.524
Nah, I'm good.

02:36.557 --> 02:40.093
But, um, we're out of these,
by the way.

02:41.094 --> 02:46.066
Okay, I'll go, uh, buy more.

02:48.436 --> 02:51.071
I have to go wake up Kevin
and tell him.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.958
*

03:18.532 --> 03:21.535
RANDALL: Hey!
All right, pack it in.

03:21.569 --> 03:22.903
You three hellions
have just completed

03:22.936 --> 03:24.338
your first week of school.

03:24.372 --> 03:27.608
That calls
for some celebratory froyo.

03:27.641 --> 03:30.010
Can't. I'm staying
after school for TSA.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.079
You're doing
airport security training?

03:32.112 --> 03:34.382
It's a Taylor Swift
Appreciation club.

03:34.415 --> 03:37.518
I'm staying after, too.
I have my Little Farmers Club.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.186
But froyo.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.289
-Bye.
-Bye.
-Bye.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.090
What about you

03:43.123 --> 03:44.792
Beyhive meeting
you got to get to?

03:44.825 --> 03:47.595
-Nope. Don't make this a thing.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.597
Okay.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.466
Yo, I'm not making this
a thing whatsoever,

03:52.500 --> 03:55.936
but, uh, it's just that it's
your first week at a new school,

03:55.969 --> 03:58.138
and every time we ask you
how your day went,

03:58.171 --> 04:01.108
you've said it was fine.

04:01.141 --> 04:04.044
What? Say it.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.814
It's just, this school
is pretty white, man.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.783
What? White people
go to this school?

04:09.817 --> 04:12.653
They got a club for milk
enthusiasts. What is that?

04:12.686 --> 04:14.788
That's my kind of club.
Where do I sign up?

04:16.624 --> 04:20.728
I miss my drill team
at my old school.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.496
Why don't you start one here?

04:22.530 --> 04:24.064
It's not gonna work.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.099
-How do you know unless you...
-Dude.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.139
(gunfire,
dramatic music playing)

05:16.717 --> 05:17.951
What do you got here?

05:17.985 --> 05:19.953
(man speaking in French
over earbuds)

05:19.987 --> 05:22.690
KEVIN: He's that French guy
you interviewed

05:22.723 --> 05:25.125
-ZOE: Yeah.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.994
Do you even know
what he's saying?

05:27.027 --> 05:28.462
Oui.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.698
Je parle franÃ§ais et trois
autres langues.

05:30.731 --> 05:35.068
Wow. Man. God.

05:35.102 --> 05:38.305
-You are so hot.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.541
Oh...

05:41.909 --> 05:42.976
Hi.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.512
-Mm-mm.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.014
I have to finish transcribing.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.049
Are you saying I can't compete
with an old French guy?

05:49.082 --> 05:51.084
Uh, no. Not when
he's talking about

05:51.118 --> 05:53.987
Earth's dwindling water supply.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.923
-No.
-Right.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.224
Eh, you're probably right.

05:57.257 --> 06:00.360
Hmm.

06:00.394 --> 06:04.064
I was gonna invite you
to my premiere tomorrow night.

06:08.035 --> 06:11.539
But I-- it's just, it just,
it's-- I... it's too soon.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.407
-It is.
-Yeah.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.443
Plus, you know I'm going
to Chicago in the morning

06:15.476 --> 06:18.211
-to sound mix.
-Right.

06:18.245 --> 06:23.050
I could drive you, tomorrow
morning, to the airport.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.553
-Thanks. You don't have to...
-I don't mind.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.120
-Really, it's, uh, it's okay.
-No, no.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.590
It's no problem.
I'd be killing time, you know?

06:32.059 --> 06:36.930
Um... look, I just, uh,

06:36.964 --> 06:41.401
I, um, I don't want
this really nice,

06:41.435 --> 06:46.807
really light, really lovely
thing to be serious, you know?

06:46.840 --> 06:47.975
You know where
I'm coming from, right?

06:48.008 --> 06:50.043
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.145
Ah, I know where you're coming--
I'm the king of casj.

06:52.179 --> 06:55.115
Okay

06:55.148 --> 06:57.384
-Mm. Oh.
-I'm not the king of cashmere.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.087
Although that's a lie,
I am the king of cashmere.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.289
-I am. I'm not ashamed of it.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.492
-You'll see. Oh, no, you'll see.
-Of course you are.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.527
Okay.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.665
Mm

07:11.699 --> 07:14.134
It's my co-op kitchen proposal.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.469
I'll work it off at barre class.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.270
No, keep it on.

07:17.304 --> 07:19.239
I like you a little slim thick.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.009
BETH:
Mm-- oh, that feels good.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.011
-Do not stop.
-Okay.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.846
Just don't keep doing that thing

07:25.879 --> 07:27.481
where you're directing me
the entire time.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.983
Ooh, just a little bit higher.

07:30.017 --> 07:32.019
Oh-- I mean, uh, no.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.020
-I'll shut up.
-Uh-huh.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.454
Please don't stop.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.624
This proposal
is kicking my ass, babe.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.492
Oh, and I may have
to go into work tomorrow

07:38.526 --> 07:39.760
before the premiere.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.428
-Yep.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.831
Just a little
bit lower, more pressure.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.934
I think I'll take Deja to
the rec center by our building.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.168
What for?

07:48.201 --> 07:49.970
There's this girl, Sky.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.204
She's one
of the tenant's daughters.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.006
-She's about Deja's age.
-Mm-hmm.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.776
Maybe I can introduce them,
they can hang out.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.778
She may feel
more comfortable there.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.379
-Couldn't hurt-- ow.
-Sorry. That's...

07:59.412 --> 08:01.114
but you-you said more pressure.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.350
-Yeah, but modulate, baby.
-Right. You got it.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.285
Modulate, but don't stop.

08:08.656 --> 08:11.058
Toby, enough with the knee.
You're driving me crazy.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.826
Sorry. I'm just su--
I'm super excited.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.695
I mean, come on.

08:14.728 --> 08:17.731
An NYC premiere?
This is too much.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.902
Ooh.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.370
What

08:23.403 --> 08:24.972
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

08:25.005 --> 08:26.974
-Fertility hormone hot flash.
-Oh, I got this.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.543
Hey, man,
can you crank the A.C.?

08:31.612 --> 08:34.047
-Oh, that's good.
-Oh, well, that is...

08:36.884 --> 08:40.153
Oh, damn, girl.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.189
You look like
you're in a Whitesnake video.

08:42.222 --> 08:45.993
Yeah, you make IVF
look very rock and roll.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.360
-Mm.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.362
Stop, that's my spot. Stop.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.932
-My gosh.

08:51.965 --> 08:55.368
I'm on the hormones, and you've
been extra frisky lately.

08:55.402 --> 08:58.438
Yeah, well, the idea of you
and me making a mini you and me

08:58.471 --> 09:02.042
makes me and mini me
very excited.

09:02.075 --> 09:06.046
Listen, all of this is big news,
and it's still early.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.915
And I-I don't want to talk
about risks

09:07.948 --> 09:09.617
or hormone shots with my mom,

09:09.650 --> 09:11.118
so let's not say anything
to my family.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.853
Yeah, I guess you're right.

09:12.886 --> 09:16.857
Some things are best kept
between a husband and his wife

09:16.890 --> 09:18.091
and his Lyft driver.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.527
Really hope the IVF works
for you guys.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.462
-Okay, thanks.
-Thanks.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.253
Looks like you could use a hand.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.455
Thank you. I can manage.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.090
Fair enough.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.962
Please, do not touch my things.
I said I can manage.

09:57.765 --> 10:00.100
WILLIAM:
I didn't catch your name.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.002
RANDALL:
Hey, ChiChi.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.237
Hey, Randall.
Is everything okay?

10:04.271 --> 10:06.840
-I did. Everything's good.

10:06.874 --> 10:09.276
I just, uh, I wanted
to introduce Deja to Sky.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.412
CHICHI:
Sky, over here.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.682
RANDALL:
Hey, Sky. This is Deja.

10:14.715 --> 10:15.983
Deja, Sky.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.251
-Hey.
-Hi.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.853
Uh, were ya'll just stepping?

10:19.887 --> 10:21.121
Yeah, you step?

10:21.154 --> 10:22.790
No, but I was on a drill team.

10:22.823 --> 10:25.025
Oh, cool. Come on,
I'll show you what we're doing.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.805
Why is that mattress
up against the wall?

10:37.838 --> 10:40.974
-Because of the hole.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.010
Because of the busted pipe.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.880
Why is there a busted pipe?

10:46.914 --> 10:49.016
Because of the water heater.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.650
Randall, are we going
to play this game all day?

10:50.684 --> 10:52.152
Because I'd like to get back
to my book.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.887
Nah.

10:58.058 --> 11:01.228
Why doesn't somebody call
the city or Parks and Rec,

11:01.261 --> 11:02.730
fix this place up?

11:02.763 --> 11:04.998
We call all the time.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.366
It doesn't work.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.702
We don't even have
proper street lighting.

11:08.736 --> 11:12.339
But if you think
you can do better

11:12.372 --> 11:15.743
after sitting around
for all of five minutes,

11:15.776 --> 11:17.177
feel free to go to city hall.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.479
Talk to Councilman Brown.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.381
Maybe I will.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.883
Okay.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.351
Maybe I will right now.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.319
Okay.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.789
Okay.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.928
I had to tell you guys first,
Ms. Yvette.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.730
We're all here. Go ahead, hon.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.732
Guess who got into H.U.?

11:38.766 --> 11:41.368
KEITH :
You know!

11:41.401 --> 11:43.737
: Yes!
-I told you you'd get in.

11:43.771 --> 11:46.073
RP, you're gonna love
the campus, man.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.741
The Greek parties,
the step shows.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.276
Yeah, and I'm-a make sure
you pledge, too.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.711
Okay, look, boy, he is going
there for an education.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.046
Hey, I can't wait.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.681
YVETTE: You'll come over
tonight to celebrate.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.784
Isaac is gonna grill and
I'll make my fried okra.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.052
REBECCA: Randall, we're late
to meet the realtor.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.188
I got to go,
but tonight sounds good.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.590
I just have to ask my mom first.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.895
Okay and that's the living room.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.097
Let's take a look
at the kitchen.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.765
JACK:
You got to admit,

12:11.799 --> 12:13.801
this place gets more
light than ours.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.803
Yeah, well, light is overrated.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.570
REALTOR:
This way.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.876
Now, this house does
only have three bedrooms,

12:22.910 --> 12:24.812
-so if that's an issue...
-No, no, it's fine.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.114
I mean, the boys
can share a room, right?

12:27.147 --> 12:28.248
I mean, Randall,
you're gonna be heading off

12:28.281 --> 12:30.150
to college in the fall

12:30.183 --> 12:32.419
and Kate, fingers crossed,

12:32.452 --> 12:34.121
you'll hear from Berklee
any day now.

12:34.154 --> 12:37.757
As for me, I'll be right here.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.993
Me, too.

12:40.027 --> 12:43.096
What do you mean?

12:48.869 --> 12:51.104
I never sent in the tape
they asked for

12:51.138 --> 12:52.873
for my callback audition.

12:56.844 --> 12:59.112
-I-I bet you can still apply
for springtime.
-Nope.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.915
-I'm done.
-RANDALL: But if you
just explain...

13:01.949 --> 13:04.952
Randall, she said she's done,
all right?

13:12.325 --> 13:15.328
Um, have you seen the backyard?

13:15.362 --> 13:17.530
It's like a vacation out there.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.466
That sounds nice.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.568
-Oh, this way. Follow me.
-Okay.

13:25.238 --> 13:28.475
Well, that was fun.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.077
Kevin.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.882
Kev. Kev, are you
hammered right now?

13:34.915 --> 13:37.684
I'm fine.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.373
Okay, so, Megan Markle tiny hat?

14:00.407 --> 14:01.975
Or no tiny hat?

14:02.009 --> 14:04.211
-I don't know.
-I like the tiny hat.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.213
-Yeah. It's cute.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.982
Eh?
-Oh, look at you.

14:09.016 --> 14:12.419
It's Italian. Huh?
Made in Pasadena.

14:12.452 --> 14:13.987
-It's very handsome.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.989
Oh, no, no, no, m'lady.
If you want handsome,

14:16.023 --> 14:19.993
please allow me to introduce
Miguel Rivas!

14:20.027 --> 14:23.596
Huh?

14:23.630 --> 14:26.033
Guys, we have to go.
Car's all gassed up.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.400
As soon as I grab a snack
for the road,

14:27.434 --> 14:29.036
then we can head out, okay?

14:29.069 --> 14:32.005
Ooh! Caramel creme.
That's my favorite.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.907
-Oh, and only 80 calories.
-Oh, no, actually,

14:33.941 --> 14:37.744
-you can't. These are Kate's.
-I can't use my own...

14:43.083 --> 14:45.152
I'm a heroin addict.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.153
I know it's loud.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.889
It's too hot.
She won't stop crying.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.425
I was wondering
if you'd had dinner.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.395
I might've made too much is all

15:28.428 --> 15:31.131
and, uh, you'd be
doing me a favor.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.476
I said I made too much.
I didn't say I made it well.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.778
It's not bad.

15:45.812 --> 15:47.414
It's not good, either.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.017
My food tends to live
somewhere in the margins.

15:52.519 --> 15:55.822
ChiChi. It's a pretty name.

15:55.855 --> 15:58.591
It's Ibo. I'm Nigerian.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.961
So it's just
the two of you here?

16:06.199 --> 16:09.602
I was married.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.705
I married very young.

16:12.739 --> 16:16.309
Me and my husband Emeka
met when I was nine.

16:18.078 --> 16:21.681
He used
to come to my house

16:21.714 --> 16:25.518
and my mother would let us
watch karate movies

16:25.552 --> 16:27.787
and Walker, Texas Ranger.

16:29.756 --> 16:34.161
So, when we won visa lottery,

16:34.194 --> 16:38.665
we knew we had to go to Texas,

16:38.698 --> 16:41.201
see the cowboys for ourselves.

16:43.103 --> 16:47.340
Emeka died before we traveled.

16:47.374 --> 16:51.344
I decided to still come...

16:51.378 --> 16:54.814
but not to Texas.

16:54.847 --> 16:59.819
Wouldn't... have been
the same without him.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.992
My NA group is putting
something together,

17:06.025 --> 17:08.561
a little celebration
for me being five years

17:08.595 --> 17:10.097
clean and sober.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.332
It's at the community center
on Fifth.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.734
A lot of people
in the building go there.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.403
Good people.

17:16.436 --> 17:19.939
A lot of them with small kids.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.975
You're welcome to come.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.415
Thank you.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.250
But I'm all right.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.892
Would you like to hold her?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.596
Are you sure?

17:50.970 --> 17:54.006
Uh, I haven't had much practice.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.912
Hello, my sweet.

17:59.946 --> 18:02.081
Sky, meet William.

18:02.115 --> 18:05.118
Hello, Sky. Yeah.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.420
Yeah.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.956
You're a natural.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.060
Hello, Sky.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.995
Hello.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.497
Hey, how's it going?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.065
BETH :
Swamped.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.168
I might have to meet you
at the premiere.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.935
That's fine.
Don't worry about it.

18:22.969 --> 18:26.473
So, uh, I took Deja to this rec
center to hang out with Sky.

18:26.506 --> 18:29.075
Place is a bit of a dump.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.311
Oh, really? So you're thinking
about buying it?

18:31.344 --> 18:33.813
-Ha-ha ha.
-Ha-ha.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.081
But I did go to city hall.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.316
I wanted to speak
to the councilman

18:36.349 --> 18:37.950
about fixing the place up.

18:37.984 --> 18:40.086
Apparently, dude is
getting his hair cut.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.755
-So you are...
-Headed to his barbershop.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.157
My man.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.825
Hey, babe, I got
to finish up here.

18:45.858 --> 18:46.959
I'm buried in work.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.127
All right. I'll see you tonight.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.405
JACK:
You could grow basil for pesto.

19:01.741 --> 19:05.011
When have you ever eaten pesto?

19:12.985 --> 19:15.154
Where are you right now?

19:15.188 --> 19:16.789
What?

19:16.823 --> 19:18.991
Sorry, hon.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.194
I'm right here.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.498
So what do you think
of this place?

19:25.532 --> 19:27.500
Have you noticed Kate's eating?

19:27.534 --> 19:31.704
-Randall...
-You know, and Kevin's
drunk half the time.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.806
But-but you don't seem to care.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.810
I do care.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.712
I'm doing the very best
that I can.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.214
They're both grieving.

19:41.248 --> 19:44.651
-I don't know.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.186
But anything. I mean, you lied.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.988
You said that you'd take care
of everything.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.990
You said we'd be okay,

19:51.023 --> 19:52.191
that you'd step up
and make sure of it,

19:52.225 --> 19:54.160
but you lied.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.563
Mm-hmm.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.168
Yeah.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.203
It's getting late.
I think we need to go.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.189
MIGUEL:
You know, our friend Carol,

20:23.222 --> 20:25.592
she has a daughter
who did the in vitro.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.959
-REBECCA: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

20:26.993 --> 20:30.029
The cute, little twins
with the weird names.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.031
-Eloise and Plaza.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.132
-Yeah.
-REBECCA: Mm-hmm.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.001
Terrible names. Yeah.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.138
-Mom.

20:39.171 --> 20:41.941
Nothing.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.711
Nothing at all, Bug.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.413
This is exactly what
I was trying to avoid.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.418
Just say it.

20:53.986 --> 20:58.825
Kate, have you guys really
considered all of the risks?

20:58.858 --> 21:00.259
Oh, can we not do this?

21:00.293 --> 21:01.961
I'm sure that they've done
the research...

21:01.994 --> 21:04.397
Because I-I did learn a lot
from helping my friend Carol

21:04.431 --> 21:07.434
and I know that
the egg retrieval surgery

21:07.467 --> 21:11.103
is a dangerous procedure
for someone...

21:11.137 --> 21:15.875
someone... your size, Kate.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.156
*

21:31.057 --> 21:34.193
* What did I do wrong?

21:34.226 --> 21:37.196
* Someone tell me...

21:37.229 --> 21:40.199
Excuse me, Councilman Brown,
may I have a word?

21:40.232 --> 21:43.035
A word?

21:43.069 --> 21:45.271
Hell, you can have
a whole paragraph.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.706
My name's Randall Pearson.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.307
I own the property
on Olney and Third.

21:48.341 --> 21:50.209
It's the big one,
right next to the laundromat.

21:50.242 --> 21:52.479
Nice to have a black landlord
in this city.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.381
Not many of those.

21:54.414 --> 21:57.016
Councilman Sol Brown.

21:57.049 --> 21:59.151
-12th District.
-Nice to meet you.

21:59.185 --> 22:00.553
All my pleasure.

22:00.587 --> 22:02.722
My father lived in the building
for several years.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.324
When he passed away,
my wife and I took it as

22:05.358 --> 22:06.859
a personal mission
to turn the place around.

22:06.893 --> 22:09.362
Good for you.
Come on, sit.

22:09.396 --> 22:11.998
-Join us.
-Thank you.

22:12.031 --> 22:15.067
So, what's on your mind,
Mr. Pearson?

22:15.101 --> 22:17.303
I'm actually here about

22:17.336 --> 22:19.539
the rec center on Fifth Street.

22:19.572 --> 22:21.708
The place is falling apart.

22:21.741 --> 22:24.176
I'm talking holes in the wall,
water damage.

22:24.210 --> 22:26.045
The streetlights out front are
either broken or missing.

22:26.078 --> 22:30.316
Yeah, that place isn't
what it was.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.552
Kills me.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.086
What part of town
do you live in?

22:34.120 --> 22:35.922
Oh, I actually live
in New Jersey.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.758
-In the suburbs.
-Oh, good for you.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.995
I grew up in South Philly.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.665
Spent a lot of time at
a rec center myself back then.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.233
Ree's Recreation Center.

22:47.266 --> 22:48.935
-No, I can't say that I have.

22:48.968 --> 22:51.771
My pops owned the grocery store
right across the street from it.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.040
I think I was in high school

22:54.073 --> 22:57.043
when there was a shooting
at Ree's.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.545
The mayor tried
to shut it down,

22:58.578 --> 23:00.246
but my pops wasn't having it.

23:00.279 --> 23:03.450
He always said, "Boy,
ain't nothin' worth having

23:03.483 --> 23:05.618
if you ain't willing
to fight for it."

23:05.652 --> 23:08.187
He got everybody
in the neighborhood

23:08.220 --> 23:10.557
to rally to keep Ree's open.

23:10.590 --> 23:13.593
Your father sounds like
he was the real deal.

23:13.626 --> 23:18.097
He was.
He really was.

23:21.568 --> 23:24.136
Last year, I cast
the deciding vote

23:24.170 --> 23:27.574
to shut Ree's down.

23:27.607 --> 23:32.144
Eh, it wasn't structurally
sound, became dangerous.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.647
In my position, Mr. Pearson,

23:34.681 --> 23:37.049
I have to make decisions
I don't always love.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.051
Ironic, isn't it?

23:39.085 --> 23:41.754
I got into politics
to honor a man

23:41.788 --> 23:44.123
who I'd now be
constantly disappointing.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.425
BROWN:
Hmm.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.062
I'm adopted.

23:50.096 --> 23:54.266
My adoptive father
passed away as well.

23:54.300 --> 23:55.968
So I have two dead fathers

23:56.002 --> 23:58.204
that I'm constantly trying
to make proud.

24:00.206 --> 24:03.142
Tell you what.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.444
I'll have a maintenance crew
come out there today.

24:05.478 --> 24:07.013
I'm gonna be there
to make sure.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.115
Hey, you have my word, brother.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.917
Thank you very much, Councilman.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.151
-My pleasure, son.
-Appreciate it.

24:12.184 --> 24:14.453
Thank you, sir.

24:14.487 --> 24:16.489
*

24:19.125 --> 24:22.529
Hey, all right. Cool.

24:42.515 --> 24:44.517
*

25:12.545 --> 25:14.413
Kevin Pearson, brace yourself.

25:14.446 --> 25:16.148
-Okay, no, here it is.

25:16.182 --> 25:19.552
I found it, so "doctors
will not even perform IVF

25:19.586 --> 25:22.054
on women over a certain weight
in Australia."

25:22.088 --> 25:24.323
-Because it's that dangerous.
-Hi, everyone.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.525
-Oh, hi, sweetheart.

25:26.559 --> 25:27.894
So proud of you.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.528
Really excited for tonight.

25:29.562 --> 25:32.064
Yeah, no, that's-that's obvious.
What's going on here?

25:32.098 --> 25:34.601
Oh, well, uh, Kate and Toby
are getting in vitro,

25:34.634 --> 25:37.336
and your mother knows everything
there is to know about IVF

25:37.369 --> 25:39.038
because of Eloise and Plaza.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.372
The book?

25:40.406 --> 25:41.774
No.

25:41.808 --> 25:43.910
REBECCA:
Kate, I'm just saying,

25:43.943 --> 25:45.177
why would you take that risk
when there are

25:45.211 --> 25:46.545
so many other options
out there?

25:46.579 --> 25:49.015
Because I want to.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.917
'Cause I want to.

25:50.950 --> 25:54.053
Because I want to look
that baby in his face,

25:54.086 --> 25:55.755
and I want to...
I want to see Toby.

25:55.788 --> 25:58.424
I want to see myself.
I want to see--

25:58.457 --> 26:01.093
I want to see Dad.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.697
And I'm the only one
in the family

26:04.731 --> 26:06.633
who's gonna carry on
a piece of Dad.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.970
-Okay, Kev.

26:11.003 --> 26:12.705
"Okay, Kev"? Real--
What's that supposed to mean?

26:12.739 --> 26:15.041
-You're not serious.
-No, no, apparently

26:15.074 --> 26:17.076
I'm not serious ever
about anything.

26:17.109 --> 26:19.045
-This is great...
-Okay, enough, enough, enough.

26:19.078 --> 26:22.114
And, Kate, of course a baby
would be cause for celebration.

26:22.148 --> 26:23.249
But...

26:23.282 --> 26:24.984
-There--

26:25.017 --> 26:26.653
How about stop at "celebration"
and just stop there?

26:26.686 --> 26:28.921
I just think it's irresponsible.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.289
-No.

26:30.322 --> 26:31.924
Yeah, you've already
made that really clear.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.492
No, Kate, now you're
twisting my words.

26:33.525 --> 26:36.095
Okay, well, for the past
20 years,

26:36.128 --> 26:39.799
you have swallowed every single
comment about my weight,

26:39.832 --> 26:41.067
but now, you want to
bring it up now because

26:41.100 --> 26:43.670
-Kate!

26:43.703 --> 26:45.071
Where do I draw the line?

26:45.104 --> 26:47.139
How do I toe the line, Kate,
because--

26:47.173 --> 26:49.942
Shut up!
Everyone just shut up!

26:55.047 --> 26:57.116
This is...
it's not about you, Rebecca.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.084
It's not about any of you.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.886
This is about me and Kate.

27:02.154 --> 27:03.923
All right? We lost a child,

27:03.956 --> 27:05.524
and now we want
to start a family.

27:05.557 --> 27:07.960
And we needed a little help
because we have bad eggs,

27:07.994 --> 27:10.529
and apparently I have
really bad sperm.

27:10.562 --> 27:12.799
So we have every expert in town
telling us

27:12.832 --> 27:14.266
how dangerous this is.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.103
And we know it probably won't
work out for us.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.871
So please, for the love of God,

27:18.905 --> 27:22.074
save the asinine commentary
from the cheap seats.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.313
Toby...

27:27.346 --> 27:29.348
I'm sorry. Look,
I'm gonna, uh...

27:29.381 --> 27:30.717
I'm gonna go clear my head.

27:30.750 --> 27:33.385
I'll see you guys
at the premiere.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.730
That's not how you do it.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.402
Five, six, seven, eight.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.543
WILLIAM: Hi, my name is William,
and I'm an addict.

27:57.576 --> 28:00.412
GROUP:
Hi, William.

28:00.446 --> 28:04.016
I've been clean for five years
and... one minute.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.755
Strange thing to celebrate, huh?

28:08.788 --> 28:11.523
Somehow it feels more special
than my own birthday.

28:11.557 --> 28:16.763
I started using 30 years ago,
when I lost my mother.

28:16.796 --> 28:19.899
The only family
I ever really had.

28:26.038 --> 28:28.941
Then I moved a couple
of blocks away,

28:28.975 --> 28:31.043
and all that changed.

28:31.077 --> 28:34.346
I met Sam,
who drove for Septa

28:34.380 --> 28:36.548
and didn't begrudge me
when I couldn't pay my fare.

28:36.582 --> 28:40.452
And Bernadette, who bested
this old junkie

28:40.486 --> 28:42.054
to a game of chess,
and for her prize

28:42.088 --> 28:44.156
asked that I accompany her
to an NA meeting.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.693
And last night I met

28:47.726 --> 28:50.262
this young Nigerian woman
named ChiChi.

28:53.165 --> 28:56.769
And she let me hold
her beautiful baby.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.905
And she told me
I was a natural.

28:58.938 --> 29:01.607
And it might as well have been
my birthday when she said that.

29:01.640 --> 29:05.011
When she gave me that gift.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.587
WILLIAM:
Community.

29:17.323 --> 29:20.326
That's a strange word
on its own.

29:20.359 --> 29:21.928
The word's not as warm
as "family,"

29:21.961 --> 29:25.097
but some people,
people like myself,

29:25.131 --> 29:27.133
we don't have family.

29:27.166 --> 29:32.504
But that's okay
because we have each other.

29:32.538 --> 29:35.141
We have this place...

29:35.174 --> 29:36.708
and that's not nothin'.

29:39.145 --> 29:41.881
That's not nothin' at all.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.422
I'm going to Ms. Yvette's.

29:50.456 --> 29:51.891
Okay, sweetheart.

29:56.062 --> 29:58.697
Hey, Ma...

29:58.730 --> 30:01.433
I-I'm sorry.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.302
-You know, about before.
-No, no.

30:03.335 --> 30:06.105
No, you don't have to be.
You shouldn't be.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.507
Okay.

30:08.540 --> 30:12.011
Randall...

30:14.746 --> 30:16.015
Randall, it's a struggle for me

30:16.048 --> 30:17.917
to get out of bed
every morning.

30:20.552 --> 30:23.822
It takes every single ounce
of energy that I have,

30:23.856 --> 30:26.158
and then I have nothing left
for the rest of the day.

30:26.192 --> 30:27.994
Nothing.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.968
And I know that isn't fair
to you guys,

30:36.002 --> 30:40.472
but I can't...

30:40.506 --> 30:42.909
seem to stop it.

30:45.544 --> 30:50.482
Huh. Did you know that
your father took me

30:50.516 --> 30:54.553
to look at a new house
a few months before the fire?

30:58.290 --> 31:00.259
Come on, Bec.
What's the harm in looking?

31:00.292 --> 31:02.094
Yeah, I've heard
that one before.

31:04.030 --> 31:07.066
Sometimes I think about where
we would all be right now

31:07.099 --> 31:08.935
if we had bought it.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.736
This house does get
a lot more light

31:10.769 --> 31:12.604
than our place, right?

31:12.638 --> 31:14.373
Yeah, well,
light is overrated.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.177
You could grow
anything you want.

31:18.210 --> 31:22.714
Tomatoes, herbs, maybe some...
maybe some basil for pesto.

31:22.748 --> 31:24.984
Uh, when have you ever
eaten pesto?

31:32.891 --> 31:35.127
Okay, go.

31:35.161 --> 31:38.164
Have fun with your friends...
college boy.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.100
Go.

31:54.013 --> 31:56.815
Okay... we saw it.
Can we go?

31:56.848 --> 31:58.884
-Y-You don't want to see...
-I don't.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.887
I'm sorry, I know
I'm being a bad sport,

32:01.920 --> 32:04.623
but I just--
I love our house, Jack.

32:04.656 --> 32:07.426
Even if it's old
and too small

32:07.459 --> 32:08.894
and doesn't get enough light,

32:08.927 --> 32:10.429
and there isn't any room
to grow basil,

32:10.462 --> 32:14.300
it's... it's our house.

32:14.333 --> 32:17.003
Okay, so we're just gonna
stay there forever?

32:17.036 --> 32:19.405
Sounds pretty good to me.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.941
Me, too. Yeah, I just wanted
to hear you say it.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.353
You sure you don't
want a ride home?

32:34.386 --> 32:37.689
I bought a bus pass. I'm gonna
get my money's worth.

32:37.723 --> 32:40.126
Fixed the light.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.161
I see that.

32:44.196 --> 32:46.465
One down, 8,000 to go.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.000
RANDALL:
I'm gonna stay on him.

32:48.034 --> 32:51.203
We deserve better than this.

32:51.237 --> 32:54.706
I can't figure you out, Randall.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.842
-I loved your father.

32:56.875 --> 33:00.312
He was a good man. We were
his family. He was one of us.

33:00.346 --> 33:05.117
I look at you, Randall,
and oh, my goodness.

33:05.151 --> 33:09.288
I see so much of him in you,
so clearly.

33:09.321 --> 33:13.159
It makes me happy. It gives me
a piece of my friend back.

33:13.192 --> 33:17.163
But we are not a we.

33:17.196 --> 33:19.165
You are not one of us.

33:19.198 --> 33:22.534
You brought your daughter
to come play here,

33:22.568 --> 33:25.337
but instead of sitting
and chatting

33:25.371 --> 33:26.872
and getting to know the place,

33:26.905 --> 33:28.740
you spent the whole day
seeing its problems,

33:28.774 --> 33:30.042
trying to fix them.

33:30.076 --> 33:34.012
I'm not even sure you know why.

33:34.046 --> 33:36.048
We are not our problems.

33:36.082 --> 33:39.085
I know you're not.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.091
I got to get going.

33:45.124 --> 33:47.759
I know you do.

33:54.966 --> 33:57.736
-Oh, wow.
-This is amazing.

33:57.769 --> 34:00.072
-Yeah.
-Toby's not returning my calls

34:00.106 --> 34:02.741
-or answering my texts.
-Ah. No way he misses
a premiere.

34:02.774 --> 34:05.043
He'll be here, trust me.

34:05.077 --> 34:08.380
-Yeah.

34:08.414 --> 34:10.616
I'm really sorry if I hurt
your feelings earlier.

34:10.649 --> 34:13.685
Oh, no, no. Hey, listen,
it's, it's fine.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.254
Okay? I mean, honestly, the idea

34:15.287 --> 34:17.256
of me having kids
makes me physically nauseous.

34:17.289 --> 34:19.458
It wasn't that, it was, um...

34:22.228 --> 34:24.230
He never saw me act.

34:26.565 --> 34:29.034
He was always
the hardest one on me.

34:29.067 --> 34:32.404
And I think it was because he
was the one person in the world

34:32.438 --> 34:34.406
that ever took me seriously.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.143
A-And I always wondered,
you know,

34:37.176 --> 34:39.611
if someone actually gave me
a shot, like, a real shot,

34:39.645 --> 34:41.647
to be the man
that he thought I could be,

34:41.680 --> 34:44.450
if I could actually go there,
if I could actually get there.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.796
And here we are, you know?

34:57.829 --> 35:00.065
In a couple hours,
we'll find out if I deserve

35:00.098 --> 35:03.101
to be taken seriously,
I guess, right?

35:03.135 --> 35:07.105
And now I'm gonna go do
an interview with Mario Lopez.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.742
The world is running
out of water.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.444
It's a major human crisis.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.112
MARIO LOPEZ :
Hey, man, I am hearing nothing

35:14.146 --> 35:16.848
-but positive things, Kevin.
-KEVIN: Good. Good to hear.

35:16.882 --> 35:18.650
-There's a lot
of great buzz right now.
-KEVIN: Thank you.

35:18.684 --> 35:20.819
-You should be excited.
-KEVIN: Thank you. I am excited.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.988
My whole family.

35:23.021 --> 35:24.423
What about a special
lady friend?

35:24.456 --> 35:27.125
-KEVIN: Uh, I just...

35:27.159 --> 35:29.094
-Solo tonight. Just me, just me.
-Okay. All right.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.696
KEVIN:
Uh, I got to ask you a question.

35:30.729 --> 35:32.298
We want to know how you keep
yourself looking so young?

35:32.331 --> 35:34.099
'Cause you look like
you could walk right back

35:34.132 --> 35:35.133
into Saved by the Bell.
I'm not kidding you.

35:37.903 --> 35:40.672
There you are.
Miguel found our seats.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.274
Toby's not here yet.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.775
I don't know
what's going on with him.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.277
I'm sure he'll make it.

35:45.311 --> 35:48.113
No, it's time to take my shot.
And he is supposed

35:48.146 --> 35:50.482
-to give it to me.
-And I'm sure he'll make it.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.318
But it-- if I don't get it
in time, it's gonna throw off

35:52.351 --> 35:54.386
-my whole hormone cycle.
I'm at high risk.
-Okay, Kate, Kate.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.054
One little slip-up
is gonna ruin the whole thing.

35:56.087 --> 35:58.123
Kate.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.192
Do you have it with you?

36:05.096 --> 36:07.966
Just make sure you keep
the site really clean.

36:07.999 --> 36:11.136
I got it. And then
it's just one push, right?

36:11.169 --> 36:12.638
Mm-hmm.

36:17.209 --> 36:21.179
You know, Kate,
after your father passed away,

36:21.213 --> 36:24.015
there was a period of time
where I just didn't...

36:24.049 --> 36:27.085
I didn't know if I was
ever gonna make it back.

36:27.118 --> 36:29.921
You know, if I could make it.

36:29.955 --> 36:31.390
MAN :
Hey, you okay?

36:31.423 --> 36:32.891
WOMAN :
No. Why? Um...

36:32.924 --> 36:34.092
MAN:
You're sure?

36:34.125 --> 36:35.994
It doesn't hurt.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.565
So the thought of anything
ever happening to you,

36:39.598 --> 36:42.167
anything, anything
that could ever put you

36:42.200 --> 36:45.103
in any sort of real harm,

36:45.136 --> 36:48.607
is just paralyzing to me.

36:52.744 --> 36:56.315
You'll see, when you have kids.

36:58.149 --> 36:59.885
WOMAN:
All I can think about was...

36:59.918 --> 37:03.188
I gained 25 pounds.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.023
WOMAN: You know
what it's like when everything

37:05.056 --> 37:07.526
is suddenly different?

37:07.559 --> 37:09.928
And I should have done more

37:09.961 --> 37:12.230
when you really started
gaining the weight.

37:13.999 --> 37:16.268
I was almost 18.

37:17.969 --> 37:23.609
I should have made
better food choices.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.110
WOMAN:
Everything you-you thought...

37:25.143 --> 37:28.447
Well, we've had
a terrible few months.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.717
Don't be so hard on yourself.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.152
WOMAN:
Babbling incoherently

37:34.185 --> 37:37.389
to a strange man.

37:37.423 --> 37:40.459
MAN:
Are you calling me a man?

37:47.633 --> 37:49.635
:
Should we do this? Okay.
-Yeah.

37:52.037 --> 37:54.172
Here we go.

37:56.475 --> 37:59.545
All right.
-KATE: Mm-hmm.

38:00.879 --> 38:04.383
One, two, three.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.355
Okay. Is that okay?

38:09.388 --> 38:12.591
Mm-hmm.

38:12.624 --> 38:15.160
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

38:16.495 --> 38:18.797
Okay.

38:18.830 --> 38:21.700
* Older chests
reveal themselves *

38:21.733 --> 38:23.268
* Like a crack in a wall...

38:23.301 --> 38:25.771
Thank you.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.539
* Starting small

38:30.308 --> 38:32.210
* And grow in time

38:42.354 --> 38:45.323
-Hey.
-* And we always seem

38:45.357 --> 38:47.859
* To need the help

38:47.893 --> 38:49.961
* Of someone else
to mend that shelf... *

38:49.995 --> 38:51.497
-Oh-- ooh!

38:51.530 --> 38:53.865
* Too many books...

38:53.899 --> 38:55.333
Yep.

38:55.367 --> 38:59.037
* Read me
your favorite line... *

39:02.073 --> 39:03.041
* Papa went to other lands...

39:03.074 --> 39:05.877
-Hi. Hi, I'm sorry.
-Babe.

39:05.911 --> 39:09.147
I overreacted, and-and then
I lost track of time.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.049
Do you still need your shot?

39:11.082 --> 39:12.851
My mom did it.

39:12.884 --> 39:14.085
Huh.

39:14.119 --> 39:16.655
-Yeah. Yeah.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.157
I've never seen you
blow up like that. Ever.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.926
What's been going on
with you lately?

39:20.959 --> 39:23.995
Yeah, it's probably
just jet lag.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.031
You know, I'm okay.

39:26.064 --> 39:27.999
All right.
Let's get our seats, yeah?

39:28.033 --> 39:32.203
* Some things,
they stay the same... *

39:33.639 --> 39:35.140
Uh, I'm sorry.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.011
How'd it go at work today?

39:40.045 --> 39:42.247
I kicked that proposal's ass.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.015
That's what's up. Psh...

39:44.049 --> 39:46.051
How'd it go with you?

39:46.084 --> 39:49.354
Uh, it's complicated.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.423
This stuff's always
complicated for me.

39:51.457 --> 39:52.958
What is?

39:52.991 --> 39:55.393
Just where I fit in.

39:55.427 --> 39:57.563
How I come off
to certain people.

39:57.596 --> 40:01.366
It's either I'm trying too hard
or I'm not trying hard enough.

40:01.399 --> 40:04.970
I can never get it right.

40:07.005 --> 40:11.109
* Mama tried to wash
their faces... *

40:11.142 --> 40:13.979
I won't have any fun there.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.581
All right.

40:15.614 --> 40:17.749
* And Daddy lost

40:17.783 --> 40:21.419
* At the races too many times

40:24.456 --> 40:27.425
* She broke down the other day

40:27.459 --> 40:32.430
* Yeah, you know, some things
in life may change *

40:32.464 --> 40:37.769
* But some things,
they stay the same... *

40:37.803 --> 40:42.440
Hi, um, uh, this message
is for the admissions office.

40:42.474 --> 40:45.443
I'm Randall Pearson,
and I already sent in my form

40:45.477 --> 40:47.178
saying that I'll be
attending Howard this fall,

40:47.212 --> 40:49.748
but I just wanted to call
to say that, actually,

40:49.781 --> 40:52.984
I... actually, I won't be.

40:53.018 --> 40:58.356
I got to, uh, stay,
stay close to home for family.

41:00.225 --> 41:03.194
Thank you for this opportunity.

41:11.002 --> 41:12.270
-KEVIN: Hi.
-Ah.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.039
-My brother, on the big screen.
-Hi.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.140
Damn.

41:15.173 --> 41:17.108
Is this movie gonna make me cry?

41:17.142 --> 41:18.844
Uh, well, you cry
at everything, so probably.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.946
Oh, it's gonna make me
cry buckets, I can tell.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.482
Uh...
-Yeah.

41:24.516 --> 41:25.884
You missed quite
a bit, actually.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.052
Um, Kate and Toby are doing IVF.

41:27.085 --> 41:28.520
-Yeah.

41:28.554 --> 41:30.288
-RANDALL: Good for them.
-I think so. Yeah.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.023
KEVIN: Mom kind of flipped out
a little bit, though.

41:32.057 --> 41:33.825
You know, which upset Kate.
She was like,

41:33.859 --> 41:35.961
"Well, I'm the only one
that's gonna be able to pass on

41:35.994 --> 41:37.996
a piece of Dad," right,
which made me upset, and--

41:38.029 --> 41:40.498
even though, to be honest with
you, it really wasn't about that

41:40.532 --> 41:42.233
for me, you know
what I mean? You...

41:42.267 --> 41:44.670
Let me ask you a question.

41:44.703 --> 41:48.774
Do you think serious people
take me seriously?

41:51.677 --> 41:53.645
What? Hey.

41:53.679 --> 41:57.082
No, I... She said
she was the only one

41:57.115 --> 41:59.217
who could pass on
a piece of Dad?

42:01.853 --> 42:04.322
:
It's starting. Hey.

42:21.139 --> 42:23.408
