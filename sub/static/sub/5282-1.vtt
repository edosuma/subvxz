02:08.711 --> 02:12.339
<i>Saturday, March 24, 1984.</i>

02:13.424 --> 02:17.511
<i>Shermer High School,
Shermer, Illinois, 60062.</i>

02:23.810 --> 02:25.394
<i>Dear Mr. Vernon.</i>

02:26.229 --> 02:29.215
<i>We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice
a whole Saturday in detention</i>

02:29.315 --> 02:31.733
<i>for whatever it was we did wrong.</i>

02:32.360 --> 02:36.890
<i>What we did was wrong but we think
you're crazy to make us write an essay</i>

02:36.990 --> 02:38.699
<i>telling you who we think we are.</i>

02:40.410 --> 02:42.035
<i>What do you care?</i>

02:43.079 --> 02:44.830
<i>You see us as you want to see us,</i>

02:45.874 --> 02:49.209
<i>in the simplest terms,
with the most convenient definitions.</i>

02:50.170 --> 02:52.087
<i>You see us as a brain,</i>

02:52.714 --> 02:56.300
<i>an athlete, a basket case,</i>

02:57.427 --> 02:58.427
<i>a princess,</i>

02:59.888 --> 03:01.263
<i>and a criminal.</i>

03:02.891 --> 03:04.141
<i>Correct?</i>

03:07.604 --> 03:10.397
<i>That's the way we saw each other
at 7:00 this morning.</i>

03:11.232 --> 03:13.108
<i>We were brainwashed.</i>

03:22.410 --> 03:25.287
I can't believe
you can't get me out of this.

03:27.123 --> 03:30.209
It's so absurd I have to be here
on a Saturday.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.630
It's not like I'm a defective
or anything.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.324
I'll make it up to you.

03:36.424 --> 03:40.120
Honey, ditching class to go shopping
doesn't make you a defective.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.887
Have a good day.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.853
Is this the first time
or last time we do this?

03:50.438 --> 03:51.422
Last.

03:51.522 --> 03:54.384
Well, get in there and use the time
to your advantage.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.303
Mom, we're not supposed to study.
We have to sit there and do nothing.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.389
Well, mister, you figure out
a way to study.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.697
Yeah.

04:02.742 --> 04:03.992
Well, go.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.735
Hey, I screwed around.

04:12.835 --> 04:15.655
Guys screw around.
There's nothing wrong with that,

04:15.755 --> 04:17.866
except you got caught, sport.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.368
Yeah, Mom already reamed me, all right?

04:20.468 --> 04:23.845
You want to miss a match?
You want to blow your ride?

04:24.681 --> 04:28.642
Now, no school is gonna give
a scholarship to a discipline case.

05:56.314 --> 05:59.566
Well, well. Here we are.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.805
I wanna congratulate you
for being on time.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.975
Excuse me, sir?
I think there's been a mistake.

06:07.075 --> 06:11.453
I know it's detention,
but I don't think I belong in here.

06:14.082 --> 06:17.125
It is now 7:06.

06:17.794 --> 06:22.547
You have exactly eight hours and 54 minutes
to think about why you're here.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.300
Ponder the error of your ways.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.429
You may not talk.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.476
You will not move from these seats.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.482
And you will not sleep.

06:45.988 --> 06:49.475
All right, people, we're going to try
something a little different today.

06:49.575 --> 06:55.372
We are going to write an essay
of no less than 1000 words

06:56.749 --> 06:58.943
describing to me who you think you are.

06:59.043 --> 07:00.111
Is this a test?

07:00.211 --> 07:03.964
And when I say essay, I mean essay.

07:05.800 --> 07:10.345
I do not mean a single word
repeated 1000 times.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.223
Is that clear, Mr. Bender?

07:13.516 --> 07:14.584
Crystal.

07:14.684 --> 07:18.019
Good. Maybe you'll learn
something about yourself.

07:18.563 --> 07:22.107
Maybe you'll even decide
whether or not you care to return.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.722
I can answer that right now, sir.
That'd be "no" for me, 'cause...

07:27.822 --> 07:29.156
Sit down, Johnson.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.574
Thank you, sir.

07:32.452 --> 07:37.205
My office is right across that hall.
Any monkey business is ill-advised.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.374
Any questions?

07:41.252 --> 07:43.211
Yeah. I got a question.

07:44.255 --> 07:47.158
Does Barry Manilow know
that you raid his wardrobe?

07:47.258 --> 07:51.511
I'll give you the answer to that question,
Mr. Bender, next Saturday.

07:52.472 --> 07:56.099
Don't mess with the bull, young man,
you'll get the horns.

07:58.269 --> 08:01.062
That man is a brownie hound.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.765
You keep eating your hand,
you're not going to be hungry for lunch.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.769
I've seen you before, you know.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.948
Who I think I am.

08:53.616 --> 08:57.452
Who are you?

08:59.997 --> 09:01.498
I am a walrus.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.199
It's the shits, huh?

10:07.315 --> 10:09.175
I can't believe this is really
happening to me.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.109
Oh, shit!

10:12.194 --> 10:14.263
What are we supposed to do
if we have to piss?

10:14.363 --> 10:15.389
Please.

10:15.489 --> 10:17.198
If you got to go, you got to go.

10:19.201 --> 10:20.869
Oh, my God.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.313
You're not urinating in here, man.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.357
Don't talk. Don't talk.
It makes it crawl back up.

10:24.457 --> 10:28.043
You whip it out, you're dead
before the first drop hits the floor.

10:29.211 --> 10:31.129
You're pretty sexy when you get angry.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.995
Hey, homeboy,
why don't you go close that door?

10:38.095 --> 10:40.764
We'll get the prom queen impregnated.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.558
Hey. Hey!

10:43.934 --> 10:45.002
What?

10:45.102 --> 10:47.630
If I lose my temper,
you're totaled, man.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.397
Totally?

10:50.149 --> 10:51.342
Totally.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.653
Why don't you shut up?
Nobody here's interested.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.448
Really. Buttface.

10:59.158 --> 11:03.479
Hey, sporto, what'd you do to get in here?
Forget to wash your jock?

11:03.579 --> 11:05.815
Excuse me, fellows, I think
we should just write our papers.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.568
Just because you live in here doesn't
give you the right to be a pain in the ass.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.126
So knock it off!

11:11.629 --> 11:13.155
It's a free country.

11:13.255 --> 11:17.050
He's just doing it to get a rise
out of you. Just ignore him.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.135
Sweets.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.515
You couldn't ignore me if you tried.

11:26.268 --> 11:27.560
So...

11:29.313 --> 11:30.397
So,

11:31.899 --> 11:34.609
are you guys like boyfriend-girlfriend?

11:36.070 --> 11:37.487
Steady dates?

11:39.490 --> 11:40.699
Lovers?

11:42.118 --> 11:45.146
Come on, sporto. Level with me.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.898
Do you slip her the hot-beef injection?

11:47.998 --> 11:49.442
- Go to hell!
- Enough!

11:49.542 --> 11:52.043
Hey! What's going on in there?

11:54.672 --> 11:56.131
Spoiled little pricks.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.472
Scumbag.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.461
What do you say we close that door?

12:08.561 --> 12:11.589
Can't have any kind of party with Vernon
checking us out every few seconds.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.523
You know the door's
supposed to stay open.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.384
- So what?
- So why don't you just shut up?

12:15.484 --> 12:16.802
There's four other people
in here, you know?

12:16.902 --> 12:20.556
God, you can count. See, I knew
you had to be smart to be a wrestler.

12:20.656 --> 12:22.224
Who the hell are you to judge
anybody anyway?

12:22.324 --> 12:23.893
Really.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.936
You know, Bender, you don't even count.

12:26.036 --> 12:28.898
If you disappear forever,
it wouldn't make any difference.

12:28.998 --> 12:32.000
You may as well not even exist
at this school.

12:34.336 --> 12:37.756
Well, I'll run right out
and join the wrestling team.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.760
Maybe the prep club, too.
Student council.

12:42.553 --> 12:43.913
No. They wouldn't take you.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.247
I'm hurt.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.166
You know why guys like you
knock everything?

12:47.266 --> 12:48.542
This should be stunning.

12:48.642 --> 12:49.919
Because you're afraid.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.671
Oh, God. You richies are so smart.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.090
That's exactly why
I'm not heavy in activities.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.716
You're a big coward.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.093
I'm in a Math Club.

12:57.193 --> 13:01.571
You're afraid that they won't take you,
you don't belong, so you dump all over it.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.849
Well, it wouldn't have anything to do

13:03.949 --> 13:07.311
with you activities people
being assholes, would it?

13:07.411 --> 13:10.064
Well, you wouldn't know.
You don't even know any of us.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.982
Well, I don't know any lepers either,

13:12.082 --> 13:14.235
but I'm not going to run and join
one of their fucking clubs.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.945
Hey, let's watch the mouth, huh?

13:16.045 --> 13:17.738
I'm in Physics Club, too.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.783
Excuse me a sec.
What are you babbling about?

13:20.883 --> 13:24.370
What I said was
that I'm in the Math Club,

13:24.470 --> 13:27.722
the Latin Club and the Physics Club.
Physics Club.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.893
Hey. Cherry.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.132
Do you belong to the Physics Club?

13:36.232 --> 13:38.107
That's an academic club.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.151
So?

13:41.654 --> 13:45.073
Academic clubs aren't the same
as other kinds of clubs.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.992
But to dorks like him, they are.

13:49.745 --> 13:51.564
What do you guys do in your club?

13:51.664 --> 13:56.569
In physics, well, we talk about physics.
Properties of physics.

13:56.669 --> 14:01.548
So it's sort of social.
Demented and sad, but social, right?

14:02.258 --> 14:05.369
I guess you could consider it
a social situation.

14:05.469 --> 14:08.429
I mean, there are other children
in my club.

14:09.932 --> 14:14.253
And at the end of the year, we have...
We have a big banquet at the Hilton.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.437
You load up. You party.

14:17.314 --> 14:21.150
No. We get dressed up,
but we don't get high.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.845
Only burners like you get high.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.181
And I didn't have any shoes,
so I had to borrow my dad's.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.184
It's weird 'cause my mom doesn't
like me to wear other people's shoes.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.937
My cousin Kent... My cousin Kendall
from Indiana, he got high once.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.607
And, you know, he started eating,
like, really weird foods.

14:34.707 --> 14:39.195
Then he felt like he didn't belong anywhere,
kind of like Twilight Zone, kind of.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.362
Sounds like you.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.115
You guys keep up your talking
and Vernon's gonna come in.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.200
I got a meet this Saturday,

14:44.300 --> 14:46.285
and I'm not gonna miss it
on account of you boneheads.

14:46.385 --> 14:51.081
Oh, and wouldn't that be a bite?
Missing a whole wrestling meet?

14:51.181 --> 14:53.334
You wouldn't know anything
about it, faggot.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.877
You never competed in your whole life.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.671
Oh, I know. I feel all empty inside
because of it.

14:57.771 --> 15:02.635
I have such a deep admiration for guys who
roll around on the floor with other guys.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.387
You'd never miss it.
You don't have any goals.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.823
Oh, but I do.
I want to be just like you.

15:09.491 --> 15:12.827
I figure all I need's
a lobotomy and some tights.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.498
You wear tights?

15:18.083 --> 15:21.794
No, I don't wear tights.
I wear the required uniform.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.172
- Tights.
- Shut up.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.846
There's not supposed to be
any monkey business.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.614
Young man, have you finished your paper?

15:54.286 --> 15:56.146
Come on Bender. Don't screw around.

15:56.246 --> 15:57.231
What are you going to do?

15:57.331 --> 15:58.456
Drop dead, I hope.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.176
All right!

16:10.469 --> 16:14.081
Bender, that's school property there,
and it doesn't belong to us.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.292
It's something not to be toyed with.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.918
That's very funny. Come on, Fix it.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.837
- You should really fix that.
- Am I a genius?

16:19.937 --> 16:21.797
- No, you're an asshole.
- What a funny guy.

16:21.897 --> 16:22.840
Fix the door, Bender.

16:22.940 --> 16:23.966
Everyone, just...

16:24.066 --> 16:25.467
I've been here before.
I know what I'm doing.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.902
- No. Fix the door!
- Shut up!

16:28.445 --> 16:29.862
God damn it!

16:33.951 --> 16:41.317
Why is that door closed?

16:41.417 --> 16:44.877
How are we supposed to know?
We're not supposed to move.

16:45.629 --> 16:46.713
Why?

16:48.048 --> 16:50.967
We're just sitting here
like we're supposed to.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.598
Who closed that door?

16:58.642 --> 17:00.377
I think a screw fell out of it.

17:00.477 --> 17:02.103
It just closed, sir.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.021
Who?

17:06.400 --> 17:08.276
She doesn't talk, sir.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.388
- Give me that screw.
- I don't have it.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.892
You want me to yank you out
of that seat and shake it out of you?

17:14.992 --> 17:17.227
I don't have it.
Screws fall out all the time.

17:17.327 --> 17:18.854
The world's an imperfect place.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.439
Give it to me, Bender.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.692
Excuse me, sir. Why would anybody
want to steal a screw?

17:23.791 --> 17:25.626
Watch it, young lady.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.889
The door's way too heavy, sir.

17:44.646 --> 17:45.897
Damn it!

17:52.529 --> 17:56.991
Andrew Clark, get up here. Come on.
Front and center. Let's go.

17:59.453 --> 18:00.688
Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up?

18:00.788 --> 18:01.855
That's right.

18:01.955 --> 18:05.750
If he gets up, we'll all get up.
It'll be anarchy!

18:07.169 --> 18:08.737
Watch the magazines.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.671
It's out of my hands.

18:14.384 --> 18:18.471
That's very clever, sir,
but what if there's a fire?

18:19.681 --> 18:23.585
I think violating fire codes
and endangering the lives of children

18:23.685 --> 18:26.338
would be unwise at this juncture
in your career, sir.

18:26.438 --> 18:30.592
All right. What are you doing with this?
Get this out of here, for God's sake.

18:30.692 --> 18:31.927
What's the matter with you? Come on!

18:32.027 --> 18:35.639
You know, the school comes equipped
with fire exits at either end of the library.

18:35.739 --> 18:38.199
- Show Dick some respect.
- Let's go.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.202
Go. Get back in your seat.

18:44.206 --> 18:47.416
I expected a little more
from a varsity Letterman.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.296
You're not fooling anybody, Bender.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.550
The next screw that falls out
is gonna be you.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.678
- Eat my shorts.
- What was that?

19:01.390 --> 19:04.892
Eat my shorts.

19:05.352 --> 19:07.337
You just bought yourself
another Saturday, mister.

19:07.437 --> 19:08.756
Oh, I'm crushed.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.007
You just bought one more right there.

19:10.107 --> 19:13.635
Well, I'm free the Saturday after that.
Beyond that, I'll have to check my calendar.

19:13.735 --> 19:17.113
Good! Because it's gonna be filled.
We'll keep going.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.809
You want another one?
Say the word. Just say the word.

19:20.909 --> 19:23.911
Instead of going to prison,
you'll come here.

19:24.788 --> 19:26.815
- Are you through?
- No.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.776
- I'm doing society a favor.
- So?

19:28.876 --> 19:30.194
That's another right now.

19:30.294 --> 19:33.530
I've got you for the rest of your life
if you don't watch your step.

19:33.630 --> 19:34.656
You want another one?

19:34.756 --> 19:35.783
Yes.

19:35.883 --> 19:39.119
You got it! You got another one
right there. That's another one, pal.

19:39.219 --> 19:42.180
Cut it out! Stop.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.457
You through?

19:43.557 --> 19:46.001
Not even close, bud.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.045
You got one more right there.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.797
You really think I give a shit?

19:49.897 --> 19:51.105
Another.

19:53.358 --> 19:54.384
You through?

19:54.484 --> 19:55.844
How many is that?

19:55.944 --> 19:58.847
That's seven, including the one
when you asked Mr. Vernon here

19:58.947 --> 20:00.808
whether Barry Manilow knew
he raided his closet.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.518
Now it's eight. You stay out of it.

20:02.618 --> 20:03.769
Excuse me, sir. It's seven.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.453
Shut up, peewee.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.752
You're mine, Bender.
For two months, I got you.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.546
I got you.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.076
What can I say? I'm thrilled.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.745
Oh, I'm sure that's exactly what
you want these people to believe.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.497
You know something?

20:23.597 --> 20:26.583
You ought to spend a little more time
trying to do something with yourself

20:26.683 --> 20:29.711
and a little less time
trying to impress people.

20:29.811 --> 20:33.507
You might be better off.
All right. That's it!

20:33.607 --> 20:36.426
I'm gonna be right outside those doors.

20:36.526 --> 20:40.238
The next time I have to come in here,
I'm cracking skulls.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.960
Fuck you!

21:04.346 --> 21:05.471
Fuck.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.408
Wake up!

22:52.996 --> 22:55.122
Who has to go to the lavatory?

23:13.600 --> 23:14.876
That's real intelligent.

23:14.976 --> 23:16.310
You're right.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.257
It's wrong to destroy literature.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.316
It's such fun to read.

23:23.652 --> 23:24.735
And,

23:27.030 --> 23:29.975
Molay really pumps my nads.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.283
Molière.

23:34.496 --> 23:36.080
I love his work.

23:45.382 --> 23:49.343
Big deal. Nothing to do
when you're locked in a vacancy.

23:50.303 --> 23:51.455
Speak for yourself.

23:51.555 --> 23:55.558
Do you think I'd speak for you?
I don't even know your language.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.147
Hey, you grounded tonight?

24:02.107 --> 24:06.360
I don't know. My mom said I was.
My dad told me just to blow her off.

24:10.657 --> 24:13.310
There's a big party at Stubby's.
His parents are in Europe.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.519
It should be pretty wild.

24:14.619 --> 24:15.604
Yeah?

24:15.704 --> 24:17.455
Are you going to go?

24:18.999 --> 24:20.067
I doubt it.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.276
How come?

24:21.376 --> 24:23.195
'Cause if I do what my mother
tells me not to do,

24:23.295 --> 24:24.780
it's because my father says it's okay.

24:24.880 --> 24:28.617
It's like this whole, big monster deal.
It's endless. It's a total drag.

24:28.717 --> 24:31.078
It's like, any minute, divorce.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.913
Who do you like better?

24:33.013 --> 24:34.138
What?

24:34.306 --> 24:36.291
You like your old man
better than your mom?

24:36.391 --> 24:37.417
They're both screwed.

24:37.517 --> 24:40.436
No, I mean, if you had to choose
between them.

24:42.022 --> 24:45.357
I don't know. Probably go live
with my brother.

24:48.278 --> 24:50.639
I mean, I don't think either one of them
gives a shit about me.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.974
It's like they use me
to get back at each other.

24:53.074 --> 24:54.241
Ha!

25:03.376 --> 25:04.627
Shut up!

25:04.961 --> 25:07.155
You're just feeling sorry for yourself.

25:07.255 --> 25:08.990
Yeah, if I didn't, nobody else would.

25:09.090 --> 25:10.534
Oh, you're breaking my heart.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.176
- Sporto?
- What?

25:15.263 --> 25:17.264
You get along with your parents?

25:17.599 --> 25:20.100
Well, if I say yes, I'm an idiot, right?

25:21.895 --> 25:23.755
You're an idiot anyway.

25:23.855 --> 25:28.275
But if you say you get along with
your parents, well, you're a liar, too.

25:35.992 --> 25:39.995
You know something, man?
If we weren't in school, I'd waste you.

25:40.413 --> 25:42.081
Can you hear this?

25:43.083 --> 25:45.125
You want me to turn it up?

25:46.753 --> 25:48.629
Hey, fellows, I mean...

25:49.464 --> 25:53.551
I don't like my parents, either.
I mean, I don't...

25:54.219 --> 25:57.956
I don't get along with them.
Their idea of parental compassion

25:58.056 --> 26:01.809
is just, you know, wacko, you know.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.769
- Dork.
- Yeah?

26:04.312 --> 26:06.939
You are a parent's wet dream, okay?

26:09.818 --> 26:11.470
That's the problem.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.763
Look, I can see you getting
all bunged up for them

26:13.863 --> 26:15.891
making you wear these kind of clothes,

26:15.991 --> 26:19.159
but, face it,
you're a Neo-maxi-zoon-dweebie.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.562
What would you be doing

26:20.662 --> 26:22.731
if you weren't out making yourself
a better citizen?

26:22.831 --> 26:25.374
Why do you have to insult everybody?

26:26.001 --> 26:28.043
I'm being honest, asshole.

26:28.628 --> 26:31.463
I would expect you to know
the difference.

26:31.673 --> 26:32.991
Well, he's got a name.

26:33.091 --> 26:34.618
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

26:34.718 --> 26:36.719
- What's your name?
- Brian.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.330
See?

26:38.430 --> 26:39.513
My condolences.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.685
What's your name?

26:47.856 --> 26:49.356
What's yours?

26:50.609 --> 26:52.735
- Claire.
- Claire?

26:53.153 --> 26:55.195
Claire. It's a family name.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.432
- It's a fat girl's name.
- Oh, thank you.

26:57.532 --> 26:59.100
- You're welcome.
- I'm not fat.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.687
Not at present, but I can see you
really pushing maximum density.

27:02.787 --> 27:07.609
You see, I'm not sure if you know this,
but there are two kinds of fat people.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.903
There's fat people
that were born to be fat

27:10.003 --> 27:13.698
and there's fat people that were
once thin, but they became fat.

27:13.798 --> 27:17.869
So when you look at them, you can
sort of see that thin person inside.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.538
You see, you're gonna get married.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.723
You're gonna squeeze out
a few puppies, and then...

27:26.728 --> 27:31.231
Oh. Obscene finger gestures
from such a pristine girl.

27:31.858 --> 27:33.734
I'm not that pristine.

27:38.323 --> 27:39.948
Are you a virgin?

27:41.951 --> 27:46.080
I'll bet you a million dollars
that you are.

27:48.124 --> 27:50.084
Let's end the suspense.

27:51.211 --> 27:53.921
Is it going to be a white wedding?

27:54.631 --> 27:55.657
Why don't you just shut up?

27:55.757 --> 27:58.467
Have you ever kissed a boy on the mouth?

28:01.179 --> 28:03.748
Have you ever been felt up

28:03.848 --> 28:07.101
over the bra, under the blouse,

28:08.228 --> 28:09.796
your shoes off,

28:09.896 --> 28:12.731
hoping to God
your parents don't walk in?

28:14.943 --> 28:16.819
Do you want me to puke?

28:18.988 --> 28:20.614
Over the panties,

28:22.951 --> 28:24.118
no bra,

28:25.954 --> 28:27.621
blouse unbuttoned,

28:28.748 --> 28:32.793
Calvins in a ball on the front seat
past 11:00 on a school night?

28:34.629 --> 28:36.255
Leave her alone.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.475
I said leave her alone.

28:51.479 --> 28:53.272
You gonna make me?

28:53.940 --> 28:55.107
Yeah.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.159
You and how many of your friends?

29:05.910 --> 29:07.161
Just me.

29:07.912 --> 29:11.191
Just you and me. Two hits.

29:11.291 --> 29:15.294
Me hitting you. You hitting the floor.
Anytime you're ready, pal.

29:23.052 --> 29:25.596
I don't want to get into this, man.

29:27.474 --> 29:28.849
Why not?

29:29.768 --> 29:31.643
Because I'd kill you.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.565
It's real simple.

29:37.358 --> 29:41.596
I'd kill you and your fucking parents
would sue me, and it'd be a big mess.

29:41.696 --> 29:44.490
I don't care enough about you to bother.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.367
Chickenshit.

29:59.255 --> 30:01.256
Let's end this right now.

30:01.758 --> 30:05.453
You don't talk to her.
You don't look at her.

30:05.553 --> 30:09.014
And you don't even think about her!
You understand me?

30:10.141 --> 30:12.059
I'm trying to help her.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.750
Brian, how you doing?

30:38.294 --> 30:40.045
Your dad work here?

30:45.593 --> 30:47.287
- Carl?
- What?

30:47.387 --> 30:48.538
Can I ask you a question?

30:48.638 --> 30:49.721
Sure.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.584
How does one become a janitor?

30:52.684 --> 30:54.002
You want to be a janitor?

30:54.102 --> 30:56.504
No. I just want to know
how one becomes a janitor,

30:56.604 --> 30:58.339
because Andrew here

30:58.439 --> 31:02.135
is very interested in pursuing
a career in the custodial arts.

31:02.235 --> 31:03.610
Oh, really?

31:05.864 --> 31:09.950
You guys think I'm some untouchable
peasant, serf, peon, you know?

31:10.493 --> 31:14.522
Maybe so. But following a broom around
after shitheads like you

31:14.622 --> 31:17.108
for the last eight years,
I've learned a couple of things.

31:17.208 --> 31:20.794
I look through your letters.
I look through your lockers.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.325
I listen to your conversations.
You don't know that, but I do.

31:25.425 --> 31:29.136
I am the eyes and ears
of this institution, my friends.

31:32.932 --> 31:35.684
By the way, that clock's
20 minutes fast.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.021
Shit.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.470
All right, girls.
That's 30 minutes for lunch.

32:27.570 --> 32:29.321
- Here?
- Here.

32:29.864 --> 32:33.560
I think the cafeteria would be a more
suitable place for us to eat lunch in.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.437
I don't care what you think, Andrew.

32:36.537 --> 32:37.704
Dick?

32:38.164 --> 32:42.110
Excuse me, Rich.
Will milk be made available to us?

32:42.210 --> 32:43.945
We're extremely thirsty, sir.

32:44.045 --> 32:46.614
I have a really low tolerance
for dehydration.

32:46.714 --> 32:49.742
I've seen her dehydrated, sir.
It's pretty gross.

32:49.842 --> 32:51.551
Relax. I'll get it.

32:53.721 --> 32:55.764
Grab some wood there, bub.

32:56.391 --> 32:59.101
What, do you think I was born yesterday?

32:59.727 --> 33:03.063
You think I'm going to have you
roaming these halls?

33:04.273 --> 33:05.315
You.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.949
And you. Hey!

33:15.535 --> 33:17.312
What's her name? Wake her up.

33:17.412 --> 33:21.456
Hey, come on. On your feet, Missy.
Let's go! This is no rest home.

33:23.418 --> 33:27.337
There's a soft drink machine
in the teachers' lounge. Let's go.

33:32.385 --> 33:35.220
So what's your poison?

33:38.224 --> 33:39.891
What do you drink?

33:42.353 --> 33:44.146
Okay. Forget I asked.

33:46.649 --> 33:47.858
Vodka.

33:49.944 --> 33:53.030
Vodka? When do you drink vodka?

33:53.823 --> 33:55.115
Whenever.

33:56.701 --> 33:57.769
A lot?

33:57.869 --> 33:59.077
Tons.

34:00.079 --> 34:02.289
Is that why you're here today?

34:03.041 --> 34:05.542
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

34:13.134 --> 34:15.010
I'm here today because...

34:16.888 --> 34:20.681
Because my coach and my father
don't want me to blow my ride.

34:21.641 --> 34:25.395
I get treated differently
because coach thinks I'm a winner.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.563
So does my old man.

34:27.982 --> 34:30.301
I'm not a winner
because I want to be one.

34:30.400 --> 34:34.404
I'm a winner because I got strength
and speed, kind of like a racehorse.

34:35.822 --> 34:38.601
That's about how involved
I am in what's happening to me.

34:38.701 --> 34:39.826
Yeah?

34:41.161 --> 34:43.163
That's very interesting.

34:46.708 --> 34:50.045
Now why don't you tell me
why you're really in here.

34:50.963 --> 34:52.297
Forget it.

34:58.930 --> 35:03.376
Claire? Want to see a picture of a guy
with elephantiasis of the nuts?

35:03.476 --> 35:05.420
- It's pretty tasty.
- No, thank you.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.938
How do you think he rides a bike?

35:11.025 --> 35:14.694
Claire? Would you consider
dating a guy like this?

35:15.279 --> 35:18.182
Can't you just leave me alone?
I mean, if he had a great personality,

35:18.282 --> 35:20.935
was a good dancer and had a cool car?

35:21.035 --> 35:25.872
You'd probably have to ride in the backseat
because his nuts would ride shotgun.

35:27.375 --> 35:28.693
You know what I wish I was doing?

35:28.793 --> 35:31.586
Watch what you say.
Brian here is a cherry.

35:31.754 --> 35:32.989
A cherry?

35:33.089 --> 35:36.133
I wish I was in a plane to France.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.535
I'm not a cherry.

35:37.635 --> 35:38.953
When have you ever gotten laid?

35:39.053 --> 35:41.304
I've laid lots of times.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.014
Name one.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.460
She lives in Canada.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.880
I met her at Niagara Falls.
You wouldn't know her.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.231
Ever laid anyone around here?

35:52.650 --> 35:55.735
Oh. You and Claire did it?

35:56.821 --> 35:59.557
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

35:59.657 --> 36:01.267
Let's just drop it, okay?
We'll talk about it later.

36:01.367 --> 36:02.560
What are you talking about?

36:02.660 --> 36:03.895
Brian's trying to tell me

36:03.995 --> 36:07.356
that in addition to the number of girls
in the Niagara Falls area,

36:07.456 --> 36:10.876
that presently you and he
are riding the hobby horse.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.336
- Little pig.
- No, I'm not.

36:13.921 --> 36:17.366
John said I was a cherry, and I said
I wasn't. That's all that was said.

36:17.466 --> 36:19.911
Then what were you motioning
to Claire for?

36:20.011 --> 36:21.954
I don't appreciate this
very much, Brian.

36:22.054 --> 36:23.164
He is lying.

36:23.264 --> 36:25.599
You weren't motioning to Claire?

36:26.726 --> 36:27.835
You know he's lying, right?

36:27.935 --> 36:30.729
Were you or were you not
motioning to Claire?

36:31.647 --> 36:33.607
Yeah, but it was only...

36:34.817 --> 36:38.445
it was only because I didn't want her
to know I was a virgin.

36:39.071 --> 36:41.933
Excuse me for being a virgin. I'm sorry.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.185
Why didn't you want me to know
you were a virgin?

36:44.285 --> 36:47.438
Because it's personal business.
It's my personal, private business.

36:47.538 --> 36:50.608
Well, Brian, it doesn't sound
like you're doing any business.

36:50.708 --> 36:53.627
I think it's okay for a guy
to be a virgin.

36:54.295 --> 36:55.503
You do?

37:06.933 --> 37:08.292
What's in there?

37:08.392 --> 37:10.977
Guess. Where's your lunch?

37:12.230 --> 37:13.688
You're wearing it.

37:14.315 --> 37:15.941
You're nauseating.

37:30.831 --> 37:32.332
What's that?

37:32.917 --> 37:34.167
Sushi.

37:35.294 --> 37:36.279
Sushi?

37:36.379 --> 37:40.507
Rice, raw fish and seaweed.

37:43.844 --> 37:46.998
You won't accept a guy's tongue
in your mouth, and you're gonna eat that?

37:47.098 --> 37:48.390
Can I eat?

37:49.767 --> 37:52.018
I don't know. Give it a try.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.056
What's your problem?

39:29.867 --> 39:31.451
What are we having?

39:32.495 --> 39:35.455
It's your standard,
regular lunch, I guess.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.417
- Milk?
- Soup.

39:44.882 --> 39:47.133
- That's apple juice.
- I can read.

39:47.802 --> 39:50.553
PB&J with the crusts cut off.

39:51.847 --> 39:54.875
Well, Brian, this is a very
nutritious lunch.

39:54.975 --> 39:57.519
All the food groups are represented.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.647
Did your mom marry Mr. Rogers?

40:01.440 --> 40:03.024
No, Mr. Johnson.

40:05.444 --> 40:09.906
Here's my impression of life
at big Bri's house.

40:15.496 --> 40:16.746
"Son?"

40:17.164 --> 40:18.665
"Yeah, Dad?"

40:18.874 --> 40:20.917
"How's your day, pal?"

40:21.168 --> 40:22.486
"Great, Dad."

40:22.586 --> 40:24.003
"How's yours?"

40:24.422 --> 40:25.630
"Super."

40:26.215 --> 40:31.010
"Say, son, how'd you like
to go fishing this weekend?"

40:31.679 --> 40:36.141
"Great, Dad. But I've got homework to do."

40:36.684 --> 40:40.562
"That's all right, son.
You can do it on the boat."

40:41.522 --> 40:42.814
"Gee!"

40:44.567 --> 40:47.902
"Dear, isn't our son swell?"

40:49.113 --> 40:50.264
"Yes, dear."

40:50.364 --> 40:52.532
"isn't life swell?"

40:53.868 --> 40:57.203
"Oh..."

41:07.173 --> 41:09.116
All right. What about your family?

41:09.216 --> 41:10.951
- Who, mine?
- Yeah.

41:11.051 --> 41:12.552
It's real easy.

41:21.353 --> 41:25.841
"Stupid, worthless, no-good,"

41:25.941 --> 41:29.053
"goddamn freeloading son of a bitch."

41:29.153 --> 41:33.072
"Retarded, big mouth,
know-it-all, asshole, jerk."

41:35.409 --> 41:39.688
"You forgot ugly,
lazy and disrespectful."

41:39.788 --> 41:43.041
"Shut up, bitch!
Go fix me a turkey potpie."

41:44.293 --> 41:45.668
"What about you, Dad?"

41:45.961 --> 41:47.086
"Fuck you."

41:48.047 --> 41:54.703
"No, Dad. What about you?" "Fuck you!"

41:54.803 --> 41:55.929
Bam!

42:00.100 --> 42:01.377
Is that for real?

42:01.477 --> 42:02.711
You want to come over sometime?

42:02.811 --> 42:04.839
That's bullshit.
It's all part of your image.

42:04.939 --> 42:06.090
I don't believe a word of it.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.899
You don't believe me?

42:08.067 --> 42:09.510
- No.
- No?

42:09.610 --> 42:11.110
Did I stutter?

42:19.119 --> 42:22.539
Do you believe this? Huh?

42:23.832 --> 42:27.126
It's about the size of a cigar.
Do I stutter?

42:28.128 --> 42:32.549
See, this is what you get in my house
when you spill paint in the garage.

42:34.969 --> 42:39.556
I don't think that I need to sit
with you fucking dildos anymore.

42:49.316 --> 42:50.400
Fuck!

43:11.338 --> 43:12.781
You shouldn't have said that.

43:12.881 --> 43:14.424
How did I know?

43:15.884 --> 43:18.553
I mean, he lies about everything anyway.

43:37.072 --> 43:38.364
Oh, shit.

43:39.158 --> 43:43.911
Coffee. Looks like it's been scraped
off the bottom of the Mississippi River.

43:45.664 --> 43:47.733
Everything's polluted.
Everything's polluted.

43:47.833 --> 43:50.835
The coffee's polluted.
The kids are polluted.

44:03.265 --> 44:04.667
How do you know where Vernon went?

44:04.767 --> 44:06.225
I don't.

44:06.769 --> 44:09.046
Then how do you know when he'll be back?

44:09.146 --> 44:10.688
I don't.

44:12.191 --> 44:14.859
Being bad feels pretty good. Huh?

44:17.237 --> 44:18.889
What's the point of going
to Bender's locker?

44:18.989 --> 44:20.281
Beats me.

44:21.408 --> 44:25.495
This is so stupid.
Why are we risking getting caught?

44:25.788 --> 44:27.288
I don't know.

44:27.831 --> 44:29.817
So then what are we doing?

44:29.917 --> 44:33.112
You ask me one more question,
and I'm beating the shit out of you.

44:33.212 --> 44:34.379
Sorry.

44:40.552 --> 44:41.704
You're such a slob.

44:41.804 --> 44:43.429
My maid's on vacation.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.072
It's drugs.

45:01.949 --> 45:03.517
Screw that, Bender. Put it back.

45:03.617 --> 45:05.827
Drugs. The boy has marijuana.

45:08.622 --> 45:11.124
- That was marijuana.
- Shut up, dick.

45:13.460 --> 45:15.378
Do you approve of this?

45:26.807 --> 45:29.168
We'll cross through the lab,
and then we'll double back.

45:29.268 --> 45:30.294
You better be right.

45:30.394 --> 45:32.880
If Vernon cuts us off,
it's your fault, asshole.

45:32.980 --> 45:35.648
What did he say? Where are we going?

46:18.942 --> 46:20.886
Wait. Wait. Hold it. Hold it.

46:20.986 --> 46:23.347
- We have to go through the cafeteria.
- No, the activities hall.

46:23.447 --> 46:24.890
Hey, you don't know
what you're talking about.

46:24.990 --> 46:26.100
You don't know.

46:26.200 --> 46:28.936
We're through listening to you.
We're going this way.

46:29.036 --> 46:32.997
You go where you want,
mother hen. Come on!

46:55.521 --> 46:56.505
Shit!

46:56.605 --> 46:58.298
- Great idea, jag-off.
- Fuck you.

46:58.398 --> 47:00.217
Fuck you. Why didn't you listen to John?

47:00.317 --> 47:01.692
We're dead.

47:02.778 --> 47:05.404
No. Just me.

47:06.448 --> 47:07.516
What do you mean?

47:07.616 --> 47:10.785
Get back to the library.
Keep your unit out of it.

47:11.578 --> 47:15.289
I wanna be an airborne ranger.

47:15.707 --> 47:18.652
I wanna be an airborne ranger.

47:18.752 --> 47:20.154
That son of a bitch.

47:20.254 --> 47:22.865
Before the day I die.

47:22.965 --> 47:25.367
There's five things I want to ride.

47:25.467 --> 47:27.953
Bicycle, tricycle, automobile.

47:28.053 --> 47:30.638
Virgin's mother and a Ferris wheel.

47:35.185 --> 47:38.104
I wanna be an airborne ranger.

47:49.616 --> 47:53.661
Three, two, one!

47:56.248 --> 47:58.609
Bender! Bender! What is this?

47:58.709 --> 48:00.152
What are you doing here? What is this?

48:00.252 --> 48:01.627
Hi.

48:03.630 --> 48:06.742
Out! That's it, Bender. Out! It's over.

48:06.842 --> 48:08.494
Don't you want to hear my excuse?

48:08.594 --> 48:09.870
Out.

48:09.970 --> 48:12.372
I'm thinking of trying out
for a scholarship.

48:12.472 --> 48:15.975
Give me the ball, Bender.
Give me that ball.

48:34.328 --> 48:36.579
Get your stuff. Let's go.

48:38.206 --> 48:41.568
Mr. Wise Guy here's taken upon himself
to go to the gymnasium.

48:41.668 --> 48:43.237
I'm sorry to inform you,

48:43.337 --> 48:46.073
you're going to be without his services
for the rest of the day.

48:46.173 --> 48:49.117
B-O-O-H-O-O.

48:49.217 --> 48:52.579
Everything's a big joke, huh, Bender?
The false alarm you pulled Friday...

48:52.679 --> 48:55.598
False alarms are really funny,
aren't they?

48:55.849 --> 48:58.809
What if your home...
What if your family...

48:59.728 --> 49:01.630
What if your dope was on fire?

49:01.730 --> 49:05.524
Impossible, sir.
It's in Johnson's underwear.

49:06.526 --> 49:08.220
You think he's funny?

49:08.320 --> 49:12.099
You think this is cute?
You think he's bitching? Is that it?

49:12.199 --> 49:15.451
Let me tell you something. Look at him.

49:16.954 --> 49:18.939
He's a bum.

49:19.039 --> 49:22.860
You want to see something funny?
You go visit John Bender in five years.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.503
You'll see how goddamn funny he is.

49:32.761 --> 49:35.596
What's the matter, John?
You going to cry?

49:38.725 --> 49:41.686
- Let's go.
- Keep your fucking hands off me!

49:43.021 --> 49:46.023
I expect better manners from you, Dick.

49:48.068 --> 49:50.069
For better hallway vision.

50:01.999 --> 50:03.150
That's the last time, Bender.

50:03.250 --> 50:05.652
That's the last time you ever make me
look bad in front of those kids.

50:05.752 --> 50:06.820
Do you hear me?

50:06.920 --> 50:09.323
I make $31,000 a year,
and I've got a home.

50:09.423 --> 50:12.284
And I'm not about to throw it away
on some punk like you.

50:12.384 --> 50:14.953
But someday, man,
someday when you're out of here,

50:15.053 --> 50:17.998
and you've forgotten all about this place,
and they've forgotten about you,

50:18.098 --> 50:20.959
and you're wrapped up
in your own pathetic life

50:21.059 --> 50:22.935
I'm gonna be there.

50:24.312 --> 50:27.674
That's right. And I'm gonna kick
the living shit out of you, man.

50:27.774 --> 50:30.443
I'm gonna knock your dick in the dirt.

50:33.155 --> 50:34.905
You threatening me?

50:35.198 --> 50:37.450
What are you going to do about it?

50:39.286 --> 50:41.954
You think anybody's gonna believe you?

50:43.290 --> 50:46.625
You think anybody is gonna
take your word over mine?

50:47.753 --> 50:50.113
I'm a man of respect around here.
They love me around here.

50:50.213 --> 50:55.134
I'm a swell guy. You're a lying sack
of shit, and everybody knows it.

50:57.345 --> 51:00.832
You're a real tough guy.
Hey, hey. Come on.

51:00.932 --> 51:04.127
Get on your feet, pal!
Let's find out how tough you are.

51:04.227 --> 51:06.964
I wanna know, right now,
how tough you are. Come on.

51:07.064 --> 51:10.425
I'll give you the first punch.
Let's go. Come on. Right here.

51:10.525 --> 51:14.612
Just take the first shot. Please.
I'm begging you. Take a shot. Right here.

51:14.821 --> 51:18.282
Just take one shot. That's all I need.
Just one swing.

51:28.043 --> 51:30.002
That's what I thought.

51:31.755 --> 51:33.881
You're a gutless turd.

52:14.214 --> 52:18.384
A naked blond walks into a bar
with a poodle under one arm

52:18.718 --> 52:21.512
and a two-foot salami under the other.

52:22.848 --> 52:25.266
She lays the poodle on the table.

52:26.059 --> 52:29.895
Bartender says, "I suppose
you won't be needing a drink."

52:30.522 --> 52:34.733
Naked lady says... Oh, shit!

52:36.069 --> 52:38.696
Jesus Christ Almighty!

52:43.994 --> 52:45.786
Forgot my pencil.

52:51.376 --> 52:53.294
God damn it!

52:55.630 --> 52:58.757
What in God's name is going on in here?

52:59.551 --> 53:00.869
What was that ruckus?

53:00.969 --> 53:02.287
What ruckus?

53:02.387 --> 53:04.930
I was in my office,
and I heard a ruckus.

53:05.473 --> 53:07.167
Could you describe the ruckus, sir.

53:07.267 --> 53:09.643
Watch your tongue, young man. Watch it.

53:13.106 --> 53:14.148
What is this?

53:15.400 --> 53:18.678
What is that? What... What...
What is that noise?

53:18.778 --> 53:19.930
What noise?

53:20.030 --> 53:22.781
Really, sir, there wasn't any noise.

53:32.792 --> 53:34.986
That noise? Was that the noise
you were talking about?

53:35.086 --> 53:38.824
No, it wasn't. That was not
the noise I was talking about.

53:38.924 --> 53:43.719
Now, I may not have caught you in
the act this time, but you can bet I will.

53:45.805 --> 53:48.057
You make book on that, Missy.

53:48.558 --> 53:52.645
And you! I will not be made a fool of.

54:08.995 --> 54:10.355
It was an accident.

54:10.455 --> 54:12.539
You're an asshole.

54:13.333 --> 54:15.084
Sue me.

54:21.549 --> 54:24.343
So, Ahab, can I have all my doobage?

54:33.436 --> 54:36.522
Yo, wastoid.
You're not gonna blaze up in here.

55:24.821 --> 55:26.613
Shit.

56:21.961 --> 56:26.131
Chicks cannot hold their smoke.
That's what it is.

56:30.637 --> 56:33.665
Do you know how popular I am?

56:33.765 --> 56:38.545
I am so popular. Everybody
loves me so much at this school.

56:38.645 --> 56:40.479
Poor baby.

56:48.530 --> 56:50.239
Five.

58:02.729 --> 58:06.273
Mr... Oh, Mr. Tierney.

58:07.192 --> 58:11.028
A history of slight mental illness.

58:12.405 --> 58:13.973
No wonder he's so fucked up.

58:14.073 --> 58:15.449
Afternoon, Dick.

58:16.034 --> 58:18.311
- Hey, Carl. How you doing?
- Good.

58:18.411 --> 58:20.579
- Good. What's up?
- Not much.

58:20.914 --> 58:22.982
What's happening?
What are you doing in the basement files?

58:23.082 --> 58:25.375
Oh, nothing. Nothing here.
Just doing a little homework.

58:25.502 --> 58:27.211
- Homework, huh?
- Yeah.

58:30.131 --> 58:32.424
Confidential files, huh?

58:33.426 --> 58:37.080
Look, Carl. This is a highly sensitive area,
and I tell you something.

58:37.180 --> 58:39.833
Certain people would be very,
very embarrassed.

58:39.933 --> 58:42.585
I would really appreciate it
if this would be something

58:42.685 --> 58:45.938
that you and I could keep between us.

58:46.940 --> 58:48.133
What are you gonna do for me, man?

58:48.233 --> 58:49.759
What would you like?

58:49.859 --> 58:51.094
Got 50 bucks?

58:51.194 --> 58:52.345
What?

58:52.445 --> 58:54.154
Fifty bucks.

58:56.324 --> 58:59.743
No, no, no, man.
No, you got a middle name?

59:01.538 --> 59:02.871
Yeah, guess.

59:03.164 --> 59:07.125
Your middle name is Ralph, as in puke.

59:08.503 --> 59:12.407
Your birthday, it's March 12.
You're 5'91 /2".

59:12.507 --> 59:14.701
You weigh 130 pounds.

59:14.801 --> 59:17.162
And your social security number is

59:17.262 --> 59:22.808
049380913.

59:24.143 --> 59:25.143
Wow.

59:25.562 --> 59:27.563
- Are you a psychic?
- No.

59:30.149 --> 59:33.735
Would you mind telling me
how you know all this about me?

59:37.282 --> 59:38.349
I stole your wallet.

59:38.449 --> 59:39.434
Give it to me.

59:39.534 --> 59:41.034
- No.
- Give it!

59:43.079 --> 59:45.440
- This is great. You're a thief, too, huh?
- I'm not a thief.

59:45.540 --> 59:46.941
Multitalented.

59:47.041 --> 59:48.109
What's there to steal?

59:48.209 --> 59:49.903
Two bucks and a beaver shot.

59:50.003 --> 59:51.070
A what?

59:51.170 --> 59:53.865
He's got a nudie picture in there.
I saw it. It's perverted.

59:53.965 --> 59:55.966
All right. Let's see it.

01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:05.210
Are all these your girlfriends?

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:06.727
Some of them.

01:00:07.395 --> 01:00:08.838
What about the others?

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:13.426
Well, some I consider my girlfriends,
and some I just consider.

01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:15.345
Consider what?

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:18.097
Whether or not I
wanna hang out with them.

01:00:18.197 --> 01:00:21.158
You don't believe
in just one guy, one girl?

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:23.535
- Do you?
- Yeah.

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:25.996
It's the way it should be.

01:00:26.205 --> 01:00:27.789
Well, not for me.

01:00:28.082 --> 01:00:29.750
Why not?

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:32.278
How come you got
so much shit in your purse?

01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:33.947
How come you have so many girlfriends?

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:36.089
I asked you first.

01:00:36.674 --> 01:00:39.869
I don't know. I guess
I never threw anything away.

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:42.179
Neither do I.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.305
Oh.

01:00:44.223 --> 01:00:47.225
This is the worst fake I.D. I've ever seen.

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.713
Do you realize you made yourself 68?

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:52.966
I know. I know. I goofed it.

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:54.759
What do you need a fake I.D. for?

01:00:54.859 --> 01:00:56.234
So I can vote.

01:00:58.237 --> 01:01:00.489
You wanna see what's in my bag?

01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:02.366
No.

01:01:17.548 --> 01:01:19.132
Holy shit!

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:21.703
What is all that stuff?

01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:24.664
Do you always carry
this much shit in your bag?

01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:26.264
Yeah.

01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:30.560
I always carry this much shit in my bag.

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:34.523
You never know when you may have to jam.

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:38.110
Are you gonna be, like,
a shopping bag lady?

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:41.222
You know, like, sit in alleyways

01:01:41.322 --> 01:01:44.517
and talk to buildings and wear men's shoes
and that kind of thing?

01:01:44.617 --> 01:01:46.702
I'll do what I have to do.

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:49.746
Why do you have to do anything?

01:01:50.581 --> 01:01:55.627
My home life is unsatisfying.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:59.449
So you're saying you'd subject yourself
to the violent dangers

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:03.202
of these Chicago streets
because your home life is unsatisfying?

01:02:03.302 --> 01:02:04.996
I don't have to run away
and live in the street.

01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:07.415
I can run away
and I can go to the ocean.

01:02:07.515 --> 01:02:09.208
I can go to the country.
I can go to the mountains.

01:02:09.308 --> 01:02:12.644
I could go to Israel,
Africa, Afghanistan.

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:23.806
Andy, wanna get in on this?

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:30.537
Allison here says she wants to run away
because her home life is unsatisfying.

01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:35.792
Well, everyone's home life
is unsatisfying.

01:02:36.669 --> 01:02:39.656
And if it wasn't, people would live
with their parents forever.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:42.992
Yeah, yeah, I understand,
but I think hers goes beyond

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:48.081
what, you know, guys like you
and me consider normal unsatisfying.

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:51.183
Never mind. Forget it.
Everything's cool.

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.852
- What's the deal?
- No.

01:02:54.353 --> 01:02:56.798
There's no deal, sporto.

01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:58.383
Forget it. Leave me alone.

01:02:58.483 --> 01:02:59.550
Wait a minute.

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:02.595
You're carrying all that crap
around in your purse.

01:03:02.695 --> 01:03:04.305
Either you really wanna run away,

01:03:04.405 --> 01:03:06.933
or you want people
to think you wanna run away.

01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:08.950
Eat shit.

01:03:11.245 --> 01:03:15.165
The girl is an island
unto herself, okay?

01:03:24.383 --> 01:03:25.550
Hi.

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:29.346
- You wanna talk?
- No.

01:03:29.722 --> 01:03:31.389
Why not?

01:03:32.225 --> 01:03:34.267
Go away.

01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:35.670
Where do you want me to go?

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:37.354
Go away!

01:03:48.032 --> 01:03:49.517
You have problems.

01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:50.977
Oh, I have problems.

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:54.147
You do everything everybody
ever tells you to do. That is a problem.

01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:56.941
Okay, fine. But I didn't dump
my purse out on the couch

01:03:57.041 --> 01:04:01.586
and invite people
into my problems, did I?

01:04:07.134 --> 01:04:08.885
So what's wrong?

01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:11.930
What is it?

01:04:16.811 --> 01:04:18.671
Is it bad?

01:04:18.771 --> 01:04:20.522
Real bad?

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.691
Parents?

01:04:38.457 --> 01:04:39.666
Yeah.

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:52.137
What do they do to you?

01:04:53.931 --> 01:04:55.891
They ignore me.

01:04:58.352 --> 01:05:04.149
Yeah.

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:10.906
What did you wanna be
when you were young?

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:15.160
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be John Lennon.

01:05:16.537 --> 01:05:18.606
Carl, don't be a goof.

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:21.359
I'm trying to make a serious point here.

01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:24.878
Carl, I've been teaching for 22 years.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:29.992
And each year, these kids
get more and more arrogant.

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:33.079
Oh, bullshit, man. Come on, Vern.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:35.055
The kids haven't changed, you have.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.254
You took a teaching position
'cause you thought it'd be fun, right?

01:05:41.354 --> 01:05:44.090
Thought you could have
summer vacations off.

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.342
And then you found out
it was actually work.

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:48.568
That really bummed you out.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:52.656
These kids turned on me.

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:57.562
They think I'm a big fucking joke.

01:05:57.662 --> 01:05:58.995
Come on.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:03.734
Listen, Vern. If you were 16,
what would you think of you?

01:06:03.834 --> 01:06:08.614
Hey, Carl, you think I give one rat's ass
what these kids think of me?

01:06:08.714 --> 01:06:10.340
Yes, I do.

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:15.204
You think about this.
When you get old, these kids...

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:18.765
When I get old, they're gonna
be running the country.

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:21.017
Yeah.

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:25.021
Now this is the thought that wakes me
up in the middle of the night.

01:06:25.731 --> 01:06:29.275
When I get older, these kids
are gonna take care of me.

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:32.237
I wouldn't count on it.

01:06:36.117 --> 01:06:38.743
What would I do for a million bucks?

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:42.398
I guess I'd do as little as I had to.

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:43.524
That's boring.

01:06:43.624 --> 01:06:45.375
Well, how am I supposed to answer?

01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:49.155
The idea is to, like, search
your mind for the absolute limit.

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:54.009
Like, would you drive to school naked?

01:06:58.806 --> 01:07:00.499
Would I have to get out of the car?

01:07:00.599 --> 01:07:01.751
Of course.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.794
In the spring or winter?

01:07:03.894 --> 01:07:05.963
Doesn't matter. Spring.

01:07:06.063 --> 01:07:08.466
In front of the school
or in back of the school?

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:09.691
Either one.

01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:11.234
Yes.

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:13.486
I'd do that.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:18.684
I'll do anything sexual. I don't need
a million dollars to do it, either.

01:07:18.784 --> 01:07:19.894
You're lying.

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:21.745
I already have.

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:26.791
I've done just about everything there is,
except a few things that are illegal.

01:07:27.001 --> 01:07:28.918
I'm a nymphomaniac.

01:07:29.628 --> 01:07:31.337
Lie.

01:07:31.922 --> 01:07:33.923
Are your parents aware of this?

01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:36.426
The only person I told was my shrink.

01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:38.845
What did he do when you told him?

01:07:39.138 --> 01:07:41.014
He nailed me.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.128
Very nice.

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:48.589
I don't think that
from a legal standpoint

01:07:48.689 --> 01:07:52.093
what he did can be construed
as rape since I paid him.

01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:53.260
He's an adult.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.779
Yeah. He's married, too.

01:07:57.615 --> 01:08:00.226
Do you have any idea
how completely gross that is?

01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:03.369
- Well, the first few times...
- The first few times?

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:05.815
- You mean, he did it more than once?
- Sure.

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.233
Are you crazy?

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:10.627
Obviously she's crazy
if she's screwing her shrink.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.838
Have you ever done it?

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:18.243
I don't even have a psychiatrist.

01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:20.912
Have you ever done it
with a normal person?

01:08:21.013 --> 01:08:22.331
Didn't we already cover this?

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:25.015
You never answered the question.

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:29.421
Look. I'm not going to discuss
my private life with total strangers.

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:31.256
It's kind of a double-edged sword,
isn't it?

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:32.425
A what?

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:36.095
If you say you haven't, you're a prude.

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:40.265
If you say you have, you're a slut.
It's a trap.

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:42.184
You want to, but you can't.

01:08:42.283 --> 01:08:44.770
And when you do,
you wish you didn't, right?

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:45.813
Wrong.

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:48.790
Or are you a tease?

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:51.193
She's a tease.

01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:52.778
I'm sure. Why don't you forget it?

01:08:52.877 --> 01:08:55.406
You're a tease and you know it.
All girls are teases.

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:57.700
She's only a tease
if what she does gets you hot.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.201
I don't do anything!

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.594
That's why you're a tease.

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:04.122
Okay, let me ask you a few questions.

01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:05.957
- I already told you everything.
- No.

01:09:06.058 --> 01:09:08.210
Doesn't it bother you to sleep around
without being in love?

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.587
Don't you want respect?

01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:12.131
I don't screw to get respect.

01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:14.633
That's the difference
between you and me.

01:09:14.733 --> 01:09:16.260
It's not the only difference I hope.

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:17.761
Face it, you're a tease.

01:09:17.862 --> 01:09:18.929
I'm not a tease.

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:21.182
Sure you are. Sex is your weapon.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:24.408
You said it yourself.
You use it to get respect.

01:09:25.243 --> 01:09:28.147
No, I never said that.
She twisted my words around.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.482
What do you use it for, then?

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:31.567
I don't use it, period!

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.779
Are you medically frigid
or is it psychological?

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:37.907
I didn't mean it that way. You guys
are putting words into my mouth.

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:39.700
Well, if you'd just answer the question.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.077
Why don't you just answer the question?

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.995
Be honest. No big deal. Yeah, answer it.

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:45.247
- Just answer the question, Claire.
- Talk to us.

01:09:45.346 --> 01:09:47.432
- Answer the question!
- Answer the question!

01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:49.667
- Don't be a jerk!
- It's easy. It's only one question.

01:09:49.768 --> 01:09:52.562
No, I never did it!

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:59.110
I never did it, either.

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:05.450
I'm not a nymphomaniac.
I'm a compulsive liar.

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:09.647
You are such a bitch!

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:12.399
You did that on purpose
just to fuck me over!

01:10:12.499 --> 01:10:16.294
I would do it, though.
If you love someone, it's okay.

01:10:17.254 --> 01:10:19.115
I can't believe you. You're so weird.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:22.493
You don't say anything all day,
and then when you open your mouth

01:10:22.593 --> 01:10:24.912
you unload all these
tremendous lies all over me.

01:10:25.012 --> 01:10:26.580
You're just pissed off
because she got you

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.999
to admit something
you didn't want to admit to.

01:10:29.099 --> 01:10:31.335
Okay, fine. But that doesn't make it
any less bizarre.

01:10:31.435 --> 01:10:35.313
What's bizarre? I mean,
we're all pretty bizarre.

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:38.926
Some of us are just better
at hiding it, that's all.

01:10:39.026 --> 01:10:40.902
How are you bizarre?

01:10:42.988 --> 01:10:45.156
He can't think for himself.

01:10:46.367 --> 01:10:47.825
She's right.

01:10:48.994 --> 01:10:52.455
Do you guys know
what I did to get in here?

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.085
I taped Larry Lester's buns together.

01:10:58.045 --> 01:10:59.629
That was you?

01:11:00.172 --> 01:11:01.657
Yeah. You know him?

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:03.174
Yeah, I know him.

01:11:04.176 --> 01:11:06.594
Then you know how hairy he is, right?

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:13.351
When they pulled the tape off, most
of his hair came off and some skin, too.

01:11:13.894 --> 01:11:15.588
Oh, my God.

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:20.525
The bizarre thing is,
is that I did it for my old man.

01:11:23.195 --> 01:11:25.639
I tortured this poor kid

01:11:25.739 --> 01:11:28.783
because I wanted him
to think that I was cool.

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:34.872
He's always going off about,
you know, when he was in school.

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:38.126
All the wild things he used to do.

01:11:39.253 --> 01:11:42.239
And I got the feeling
that he was disappointed

01:11:42.339 --> 01:11:45.091
that I never cut loose on anyone, right.

01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:53.349
So, I'm sitting in the locker room
and I'm taping up my knee.

01:11:55.769 --> 01:12:00.064
And Larry's undressing
a couple lockers down from me.

01:12:04.069 --> 01:12:08.114
And he's kind of... He's kind of skinny.
He's weak.

01:12:10.075 --> 01:12:16.664
And I started thinking about my father
and his attitude about weakness.

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:20.668
And the next thing I knew

01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:26.174
I jumped on top of him
and started wailing on him.

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:31.888
And my friends, they just laughed
and cheered me on.

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:36.559
And afterwards,

01:12:38.812 --> 01:12:41.898
when I was sitting in Vernon's office,

01:12:44.318 --> 01:12:46.277
all I could think about

01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:49.322
was Larry's father

01:12:51.158 --> 01:12:53.659
and Larry having to go home

01:12:55.329 --> 01:12:58.748
and explain what happened to him.

01:13:02.878 --> 01:13:05.421
And the humiliation.

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:10.468
Fucking humiliation he must have felt.

01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:15.932
It must have been unreal.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.355
I mean, how do you apologize
for something like that?

01:13:26.276 --> 01:13:27.860
There's no way.

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:35.201
It's all because of me and my old man.

01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:41.416
God, I fucking hate him.

01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:45.237
He's like this...

01:13:45.337 --> 01:13:49.549
He's like this mindless machine
that I can't even relate to anymore.

01:13:50.384 --> 01:13:54.345
"Andrew! You've got to be number one!"

01:13:55.639 --> 01:13:58.334
"I won't tolerate any losers
in this family."

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:03.438
"Your intensity is for shit!
Win! Win! Win!"

01:14:04.648 --> 01:14:06.774
You son of a bitch.

01:14:10.028 --> 01:14:13.531
You know, sometimes I wish
my knee would give,

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:17.160
then I wouldn't be able
to wrestle anymore.

01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:20.872
Then he could forget all about me.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:26.419
I think your old man and my old man
should get together and go bowling.

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:34.411
It's like me, you know, with my grades.

01:14:34.511 --> 01:14:37.331
Like when I...
When I step outside myself

01:14:37.431 --> 01:14:40.725
and like when I look in
at myself, you know.

01:14:43.937 --> 01:14:46.105
And I... And I see me.

01:14:49.526 --> 01:14:51.527
I don't like what I see.

01:14:52.946 --> 01:14:54.530
I really don't.

01:14:55.073 --> 01:14:58.826
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you like yourself?

01:14:59.953 --> 01:15:02.038
Sounds stupid, but,

01:15:06.251 --> 01:15:08.294
because I'm failing shop.

01:15:09.379 --> 01:15:14.050
We had this assignment, you know,
to make this, like, ceramic elephant

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:16.787
and we had eight weeks to do it.

01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:20.374
And then, you know, we're supposed to...
it was, like, a lamp.

01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:25.436
And when, you know, when you pull it,
the trunk, the light was supposed to go on.

01:15:26.271 --> 01:15:28.773
But my light didn't go on.

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:31.901
I got an F on it.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.613
I've never got an F in my life.

01:15:36.281 --> 01:15:39.435
When I signed up, you know,
for the course, I mean,

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:41.228
I thought I was playing it
real smart, you know,

01:15:41.328 --> 01:15:43.021
'cause I thought,
you know, I'll take shop.

01:15:43.121 --> 01:15:45.941
It'll be such an easy way to maintain
my grade point average.

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:48.292
Why'd you think it'd be easy?

01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:52.114
Have you seen some of the dopes
that take shop?

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:56.535
I take shop.
You must be a fucking idiot.

01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:58.203
I'm a fucking idiot
because I can't make a lamp?

01:15:58.303 --> 01:16:01.514
No, you're a genius
because you can't make a lamp.

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:03.584
What do you know about trigonometry?

01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:05.878
I could care less about trigonometry.

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:08.380
Bender, did you know without trigonometry,
there'd be no engineering?

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:10.257
Without lamps, there'd be no light.

01:16:10.357 --> 01:16:14.094
Okay, so neither one of you
is any better than the other one.

01:16:14.194 --> 01:16:16.362
I can write with my toes.

01:16:17.197 --> 01:16:19.892
I can also eat, brush my teeth.

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:21.325
With your feet?

01:16:22.786 --> 01:16:24.271
Play Heart And Soul on the piano.

01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:26.372
I can make spaghetti.

01:16:27.207 --> 01:16:28.958
What can you do?

01:16:29.167 --> 01:16:32.946
I can tape all of your buns together.

01:16:33.046 --> 01:16:35.381
I wanna see what Claire can do.

01:16:35.716 --> 01:16:36.825
I can't do anything.

01:16:36.925 --> 01:16:38.968
Everybody can do something.

01:16:40.387 --> 01:16:42.513
There's one thing I can do.

01:16:43.348 --> 01:16:44.917
No, forget it.
It's way too embarrassing.

01:16:45.017 --> 01:16:46.543
You ever seen Wild Kingdom?

01:16:46.643 --> 01:16:49.604
That guy's been doing
that show for 30 years.

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:51.673
Okay.

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:54.358
But you have to swear to God
you won't laugh.

01:16:57.863 --> 01:16:59.363
Okay.

01:17:01.533 --> 01:17:04.535
I can't believe I'm actually doing this.

01:17:19.176 --> 01:17:23.888
All right. That's great!
Where'd you learn to do that?

01:17:24.389 --> 01:17:26.432
Camp. Seventh grade.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:33.689
That was great, Claire.

01:17:34.858 --> 01:17:37.636
My image of you is totally blown.

01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:41.515
You're a shit. Don't do that to her.
You swore to God you wouldn't laugh.

01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:43.016
Am I laughing?

01:17:43.116 --> 01:17:44.950
You fucking prick!

01:17:47.412 --> 01:17:50.081
What do you care what I think anyway?

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:53.459
I don't even count, right?

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:57.963
I could disappear forever
and it wouldn't make any difference.

01:17:59.549 --> 01:18:03.886
I may as well not even exist
at this school, remember?

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:11.086
And you don't like me anyway.

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:13.463
You know, I have just
as many feelings as you do

01:18:13.563 --> 01:18:15.841
and it hurts just as much
when somebody steps all over them.

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:18.135
God, you're so pathetic.

01:18:18.235 --> 01:18:22.446
Don't you ever,
ever compare yourself to me, okay?

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:26.143
You got everything, and I got shit.

01:18:26.243 --> 01:18:28.228
Fucking Rapunzel, right?

01:18:28.328 --> 01:18:31.857
School would probably shut down
if you didn't show up.

01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:34.192
Queenie isn't here.

01:18:34.292 --> 01:18:36.361
I like those earrings, Claire.

01:18:36.461 --> 01:18:37.779
Shut up.

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:39.281
Are those real diamonds, Claire?

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:40.490
Shut up!

01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:44.536
I bet they are.
Did you work for the money...

01:18:44.636 --> 01:18:47.096
- Shut your mouth!
- ...for those earrings?

01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:49.875
- Or did your daddy buy those for you?
- Shut up!

01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:52.210
I bet he bought those for you.

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:56.063
I bet those were
a Christmas gift, right?

01:18:56.481 --> 01:18:58.175
You know what I got
for Christmas this year?

01:18:58.275 --> 01:19:01.136
It was a banner fucking year
at the old Bender family.

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:03.096
I got a carton of cigarettes.

01:19:03.196 --> 01:19:06.808
The old man grabbed me and said,
"Hey, smoke up, Johnny."

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:10.745
Okay, so go home and cry to your daddy.
Don't cry here, okay?

01:19:23.049 --> 01:19:25.760
My God, are we gonna be
like our parents?

01:19:26.136 --> 01:19:27.678
Not me.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:32.183
Ever.

01:19:34.561 --> 01:19:36.312
It's unavoidable.

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:39.106
It just happens.

01:19:40.317 --> 01:19:42.067
What happens?

01:19:43.904 --> 01:19:48.100
When you grow up, your heart dies.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.867
Who cares?

01:19:50.577 --> 01:19:52.745
I care.

01:19:54.664 --> 01:19:56.832
I was just thinking, I mean,

01:19:57.876 --> 01:20:01.629
I know it's kind of a weird time,
but I was just wondering,

01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:09.261
what is going to happen to us on Monday,
when we're all together again?

01:20:10.388 --> 01:20:13.140
I mean, I consider you guys my friends.

01:20:14.392 --> 01:20:16.519
I'm not wrong, am I?

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:19.063
No.

01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:22.134
So... So on Monday, what happens?

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:24.568
Are we still friends, you mean?

01:20:25.237 --> 01:20:26.555
If we're friends now, that is.

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:27.905
Yeah.

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:30.934
Do you want the truth?

01:20:31.034 --> 01:20:32.576
Yeah, I want the truth.

01:20:34.204 --> 01:20:35.871
I don't think so.

01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:39.959
With all of us or just John?

01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:42.320
With all of you.

01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:44.156
That's a real nice attitude, Claire.

01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:45.991
Oh, be honest, Andy.

01:20:46.091 --> 01:20:50.553
If Brian came walking up to you in the hall
on Monday, what would you do?

01:20:50.762 --> 01:20:53.874
I mean, picture this.
You're there with all the sports.

01:20:53.974 --> 01:20:57.127
I know exactly what you'd do.
You'd say hi to him, and when he left

01:20:57.227 --> 01:21:00.964
you'd cut him all up so your friends
wouldn't think you really liked him.

01:21:01.064 --> 01:21:02.758
No way.

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:04.217
Okay.

01:21:04.317 --> 01:21:05.969
What if I came up to you?

01:21:06.069 --> 01:21:07.929
Same exact thing.

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:10.682
You are a bitch!

01:21:10.782 --> 01:21:13.310
Why, 'cause I'm telling the truth?
That makes me a bitch?

01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:16.229
No, 'cause you know how shitty
that is to do to someone.

01:21:16.329 --> 01:21:18.523
And you don't got the balls
to stand up to your friends

01:21:18.623 --> 01:21:20.525
and tell them you're gonna like
who you wanna like.

01:21:20.625 --> 01:21:22.944
Okay, what about you, you hypocrite?

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:26.406
Why don't you take Allison to one
of your heavy metal vomit parties?

01:21:26.506 --> 01:21:28.909
Or take Brian out to the parking lot
at lunch to get high?

01:21:29.009 --> 01:21:31.369
Or what about Andy, for that matter?
What about me?

01:21:31.469 --> 01:21:34.623
What would your friends say if we
were walking down the hall together?

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:35.999
They'd laugh their asses off,

01:21:36.099 --> 01:21:37.876
and you'd probably tell them
you were doing it with me

01:21:37.976 --> 01:21:39.336
so they'd forgive you
for being seen with me.

01:21:39.436 --> 01:21:41.421
Don't you ever talk about my friends!

01:21:41.521 --> 01:21:44.424
You don't know any of my friends,
you don't look at any of my friends,

01:21:44.524 --> 01:21:47.719
and you certainly wouldn't condescend
to speak to any of my friends!

01:21:47.819 --> 01:21:49.346
So you just stick
to the things you know,

01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:53.308
shopping, nail polish,
your father's BMW, and your poor, rich,

01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:55.393
- drunk mother in the Caribbean.
- Shut up!

01:21:55.493 --> 01:21:57.187
As far as being concerned
about what's gonna happen

01:21:57.287 --> 01:21:58.897
when you and I walk down
the hallways of school,

01:21:58.997 --> 01:22:01.399
you can forget it,
'cause it's never gonna happen.

01:22:01.499 --> 01:22:05.070
Just bury your head in the sand
and wait for your fucking prom!

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:06.363
I hate you!

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:08.255
Yeah? Good!

01:22:14.012 --> 01:22:18.390
Okay, then I assume Allison and I
are better people than you guys, huh?

01:22:18.683 --> 01:22:20.476
Us weirdoes.

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:25.465
Would you... Would you do that to me?

01:22:25.565 --> 01:22:27.441
I don't have any friends.

01:22:29.861 --> 01:22:31.346
Well, if you did.

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:32.905
No.

01:22:35.408 --> 01:22:38.452
I don't think the kind of friends
I'd have would mind.

01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:43.707
Well, I just wanna tell each of you
that I wouldn't do that.

01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:47.586
I wouldn't and I will not.

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:52.091
'Cause I think that's real shitty.

01:22:54.344 --> 01:22:57.805
Your friends wouldn't mind
because they look up to us.

01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:02.685
You're so conceited, Claire.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.312
You're so conceited.

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:08.300
You're so, like, full of yourself.
Why are you like that?

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:11.026
I'm not saying that to be conceited.

01:23:11.736 --> 01:23:15.724
I hate it. I hate having to go along
with everything my friends say.

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:18.117
Well, then why do you do it?

01:23:18.868 --> 01:23:20.869
I don't know. I don't...

01:23:21.913 --> 01:23:24.415
You don't understand. You don't...

01:23:25.208 --> 01:23:29.070
You're not friends with the same kind
of people that Andy and I are friends with.

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:33.757
You know, you just don't understand
the pressure that they can put on you.

01:23:33.925 --> 01:23:35.911
I don't understand what?

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:39.096
You think I don't
understand pressure, Claire?

01:23:39.514 --> 01:23:42.516
Well, fuck you! Fuck you!

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.568
You know why I'm here today?

01:23:54.779 --> 01:23:56.613
Do you?

01:23:59.617 --> 01:24:01.937
I'm here

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:06.874
because Mr. Ryan found a gun
in my locker.

01:24:10.128 --> 01:24:12.629
Why'd you have a gun in your locker?

01:24:13.089 --> 01:24:14.882
I tried.

01:24:16.801 --> 01:24:22.139
When you pull the fucking trunk on it,
the light's supposed to go on.

01:24:23.266 --> 01:24:25.017
It didn't go on.

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.381
What's the gun for, Brian?

01:24:29.481 --> 01:24:30.548
Just forget it.

01:24:30.648 --> 01:24:32.608
You brought it up, man.

01:24:34.861 --> 01:24:36.570
I can't have an F.

01:24:40.366 --> 01:24:45.287
I can't have it, and I know
my parents can't have it.

01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:52.612
Even if I ace the rest of the semester,
I'm still only a B.

01:24:52.712 --> 01:24:54.880
Everything's ruined for me.

01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:56.715
Brian.

01:24:57.175 --> 01:24:58.634
What?

01:25:03.348 --> 01:25:05.891
Considering my options, you know.

01:25:06.017 --> 01:25:08.003
No, killing yourself is not an option.

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:11.355
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
No, I don't think so.

01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:14.233
It was a handgun?

01:25:15.819 --> 01:25:18.930
No, it was a flare gun.
It went off in my locker.

01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:20.697
Really?

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:24.618
It's not funny.

01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:40.884
Yes, it is.

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:46.223
Fucking elephant was destroyed.

01:25:47.308 --> 01:25:50.144
You wanna know
what I did to get in here?

01:25:53.064 --> 01:25:55.065
Nothing.

01:25:55.775 --> 01:25:58.402
I didn't have anything better to do.

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:06.144
You're laughing at me.

01:26:06.244 --> 01:26:08.495
- No!
- Yeah, you are.

01:27:54.769 --> 01:27:56.061
Brian?

01:27:56.312 --> 01:27:57.312
Mmm?

01:27:57.855 --> 01:27:59.856
Are you gonna write your paper?

01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:01.608
Yeah. Why?

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:07.432
Well, it's kind of a waste for all of us
to write our paper, don't you think?

01:28:07.532 --> 01:28:09.601
Well, that's what Vernon wants us to do.

01:28:09.701 --> 01:28:13.996
True. But I think we'd all
kind of say the same thing.

01:28:15.081 --> 01:28:18.276
You just don't wanna
write your paper, right?

01:28:18.376 --> 01:28:22.379
True, but you're the smartest, right?

01:28:22.839 --> 01:28:24.339
Well...

01:28:24.716 --> 01:28:26.341
We trust you.

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:31.263
Yeah.

01:28:33.516 --> 01:28:37.185
All right. I'll do it.

01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:39.938
Great.

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:54.411
Come on.

01:28:54.912 --> 01:28:56.288
Where we going?

01:28:56.706 --> 01:28:58.248
Come on.

01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:01.543
Don't be afraid.

01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:05.990
Don't stick that in my eye.
I'm not sticking...

01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:09.760
Just close it. No, wait, wait.
Just go like... Go like that.

01:29:10.345 --> 01:29:11.720
Good.

01:29:15.475 --> 01:29:18.503
You know, you really do look better
without all that black shit on your eyes.

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:21.855
Hey, I like that black shit.

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.608
This looks a lot better.

01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:26.193
Look up.

01:29:35.119 --> 01:29:38.538
Please. Why are you being so nice to me?

01:29:40.124 --> 01:29:42.167
'Cause you're letting me.

01:29:58.851 --> 01:30:00.352
You lost?

01:30:52.363 --> 01:30:54.197
Thank you.

01:31:02.206 --> 01:31:03.874
Why'd you do that?

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:06.209
'Cause I knew you wouldn't.

01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:11.908
You know how you said before how your
parents use you to get back at each other?

01:31:12.008 --> 01:31:14.926
Wouldn't I be outstanding
in that capacity?

01:31:17.763 --> 01:31:21.209
Were you really disgusted
about what I did with my lipstick?

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:22.851
Truth?

01:31:23.269 --> 01:31:24.895
Truth.

01:31:25.521 --> 01:31:26.646
No.

01:31:37.033 --> 01:31:39.326
What happened to you?

01:31:39.994 --> 01:31:42.204
Why? Claire did it.

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:48.710
What's wrong?

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:50.154
Nothing's wrong.

01:31:50.254 --> 01:31:54.591
It's just... You're just so different,
you know.

01:31:56.427 --> 01:31:58.053
I can see your face.

01:31:59.096 --> 01:32:00.805
Is that good or bad?

01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:04.643
That's good.

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.409
- See you, Brian.
- Hey, Carl.

01:32:22.787 --> 01:32:23.855
See you next Saturday.

01:32:23.955 --> 01:32:25.413
You bet.

01:34:10.686 --> 01:34:12.145
<i>Dear Mr. Vernon.</i>

01:34:13.731 --> 01:34:16.676
<i>We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice
a whole Saturday in detention</i>

01:34:16.776 --> 01:34:18.970
<i>for whatever it was we did wrong</i>

01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:20.972
<i>but we think you're crazy
to make us write an essay</i>

01:34:21.072 --> 01:34:23.057
<i>telling you who we think we are.</i>

01:34:23.157 --> 01:34:25.434
<i>You see us as you want to see us,</i>

01:34:25.534 --> 01:34:29.438
<i>in the simplest terms,
with the most convenient definitions.</i>

01:34:29.538 --> 01:34:33.818
<i>But what we found out is that
each one of us is a brain.</i>

01:34:33.918 --> 01:34:35.486
<i>And an athlete.</i>

01:34:35.586 --> 01:34:37.655
<i>And a basket case.</i>

01:34:37.755 --> 01:34:38.948
<i>A princess.</i>

01:34:39.048 --> 01:34:40.783
<i>And a criminal.</i>

01:34:40.883 --> 01:34:43.828
<i>Does that answer your question?</i>

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:47.263
<i>Sincerely yours, The Breakfast Club.</i>
