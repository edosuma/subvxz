00:08.145 --> 00:10.281
How can you not know this is wrong?

00:10.380 --> 00:14.018
You are a man of order, a man of law.

00:14.117 --> 00:16.186
You're wasting your breath.

00:16.285 --> 00:17.553
She has my family.

00:17.654 --> 00:19.422
She destroyed mine.

00:19.523 --> 00:22.026
My brothers and sisters, all of them.

00:23.259 --> 00:24.962
I can't order you, Peacekeeper,

00:25.061 --> 00:26.373
but I can ask you...

00:27.398 --> 00:29.856
Just kill me. Stake me. Burn me.

00:30.666 --> 00:33.037
But don't bring me to her.

00:46.616 --> 00:49.686
Xibalbans have always tortured
culebras with the sun.

01:03.534 --> 01:05.669
For punishment.

01:06.254 --> 01:07.737
For sport.

01:10.106 --> 01:14.577
When Amaru walks among us,
the gateway will open.

01:14.678 --> 01:16.413
Hell will consume us.

01:18.181 --> 01:19.649
Is that what you want?

01:21.651 --> 01:24.088
You're ending the world.

02:31.821 --> 02:35.159
The ashes of six Lords.

02:36.659 --> 02:38.061
But not the seventh.

02:39.895 --> 02:41.798
Where is she?

02:42.640 --> 02:46.070
Eight hours from the prison to Matanzas.

02:47.203 --> 02:49.840
They should be here. Soon.

02:49.940 --> 02:53.677
We need to hurry. The eclipse is near.

02:53.776 --> 02:55.244
They'll be here.

02:59.816 --> 03:01.185
Prepare for the worst.

03:02.651 --> 03:05.621
Make sure the ceremony
is not interrupted.

03:24.207 --> 03:26.175
Okay, everybody, let's go.
Let's get a move on.

03:26.275 --> 03:27.577
We gotta catch up to the Ranger.

03:27.678 --> 03:29.312
Whoa, wait.

03:29.412 --> 03:31.314
This is what Richard was talking about?

03:31.339 --> 03:33.549
Yep. This is the culebra
venom from the prison.

03:33.650 --> 03:37.121
It looks like they were regularly
milking the population.

03:37.221 --> 03:38.622
Put a little bit of this
in some dirty bombs,

03:38.721 --> 03:40.256
dip some bullets in it,

03:40.357 --> 03:43.727
you're gonna hurt
a Xibalban really good.

03:43.827 --> 03:46.864
Venom bullets? Thought I'd seen it all.

03:50.799 --> 03:52.835
They wanna skin Xibalbans.

03:52.935 --> 03:55.538
If we can save Lord Venganza,
we're with you all the way.

03:56.606 --> 03:58.308
That's what I like to hear.

04:01.844 --> 04:04.214
All right.

04:04.314 --> 04:05.582
Matanzas.

04:05.681 --> 04:07.550
It was a mining town in its heyday.

04:07.650 --> 04:09.386
For culebras, it was Boomtown.

04:09.485 --> 04:11.822
Settlers would come through,
work in the mines.

04:11.922 --> 04:14.691
We would drink the settlers
and keep the gold.

04:14.791 --> 04:16.260
Yeah, I'll bet.

04:16.358 --> 04:19.019
We built tunnels to hide
from the sun, undetected.

04:19.595 --> 04:22.265
Now, there are trap doors
and storm cellars,

04:22.366 --> 04:24.301
all with access to the town below.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.701
Anything could be down here.

04:25.802 --> 04:28.405
Just like anything could
still happen with you.

04:30.340 --> 04:31.775
You need me to show you the way.

04:32.215 --> 04:33.776
I know its secrets.

04:33.876 --> 04:35.478
Richard's right.

04:35.578 --> 04:38.215
For all we know, you could
be after buried treasure.

04:39.448 --> 04:41.318
<i>O otra pendejada.</i>

04:43.958 --> 04:45.293
I'm in it for the cause.

04:48.209 --> 04:49.277
No tricks.

04:50.997 --> 04:53.729
- I can handle him.
- Good.

04:55.330 --> 04:56.499
Okay.

04:57.499 --> 04:59.308
According to the Professor,

04:59.970 --> 05:02.773
this ceremony needs
to start in seven hours.

05:02.873 --> 05:05.209
- Why's that?
- There's an eclipse.

05:05.309 --> 05:07.910
It's a timing thing.
Tell 'em about it, Carlito.

05:08.977 --> 05:10.314
The abandoned mine...

05:11.980 --> 05:15.251
here, the doorway to hell.

05:15.352 --> 05:17.787
You can't get to it
without going through the town.

05:17.888 --> 05:19.722
Whatever we do,

05:19.823 --> 05:21.725
we cannot let the ceremony happen.

05:21.825 --> 05:24.761
If Amaru regains her true form,

05:24.861 --> 05:27.965
the doorway will open,
and it will welcome her.

05:28.064 --> 05:31.867
Yeah, and the ceremony has
to take place during daylight.

05:31.967 --> 05:35.739
And conveniently,
the church has a skylight.

05:35.838 --> 05:38.975
Which means they're going
to protect the fuck out of it.

05:39.076 --> 05:40.576
We need to draw their fire.

05:40.677 --> 05:42.845
Richard and I'll take
the boys from C Block.

05:42.946 --> 05:45.482
The rest of you, get underground,

05:45.581 --> 05:47.583
infiltrate and you stop the ceremony.

05:47.684 --> 05:50.886
By "stop the ceremony," I mean you
get that Queen Bitch outta Kate.

05:50.987 --> 05:52.756
We're ready.

05:52.855 --> 05:55.491
That's what you think.
You can't be ready for this.

06:03.534 --> 06:05.003
All right, listen.

06:05.835 --> 06:10.006
Anything goes wrong,
if we get... held up...

06:11.674 --> 06:14.378
I'm trusting you two to finish her off.

06:15.544 --> 06:16.979
Finish off Kate?

06:19.415 --> 06:20.450
Yeah.

06:38.633 --> 06:42.538
So it's meat grinder
down below or burnt to a crisp up top.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.540
Not much of a choice.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.609
I mean, if you wanna
be negative about it.

06:47.809 --> 06:49.612
Yo, Ancient One.

06:49.713 --> 06:53.482
You... need some stuff in your arsenal.

06:53.583 --> 06:55.352
- The fuck is that?
- This...

06:57.119 --> 06:58.788
...is the unexpected.

06:58.888 --> 07:02.059
I'm tellin' ya,
people never see it coming.

07:02.158 --> 07:03.759
Dig it.

07:03.859 --> 07:06.362
That's the dumbest fucking
thing I've ever seen.

07:06.463 --> 07:07.797
Oh, come on!

07:07.898 --> 07:09.866
We gonna get all
<i>Dirty Dozen</i> on this one?

07:09.965 --> 07:13.804
Everybody dies in that movie.
Pick another one.

07:14.902 --> 07:15.971
<i>Guns of Navarone.</i>

07:16.071 --> 07:17.506
Almost all of them make it,

07:17.607 --> 07:19.842
except Stanley Baker and, uh...

07:19.943 --> 07:21.503
that hot chick.

07:23.102 --> 07:24.915
Just put your gloves on, Richard.

09:02.644 --> 09:05.681
Your husband loves you very much.

09:10.052 --> 09:11.587
Let's go.

09:14.624 --> 09:18.829
Billions of people are begging
you, don't do this.

09:18.928 --> 09:20.095
Quiet.

09:27.135 --> 09:29.505
Congratulations
on your catch, Peacekeeper.

09:29.605 --> 09:33.242
I had a feeling about you
from the beginning.

09:34.677 --> 09:37.247
I should have recruited you sooner,

09:37.346 --> 09:40.267
instead of trusting mindless
dogs like Zolo.

09:45.754 --> 09:47.056
You let him talk to you like that?

09:48.657 --> 09:49.960
Why don't you just kick his ass?

09:50.060 --> 09:51.795
I beat him in a fair fight.

09:52.795 --> 09:54.498
He must do what I say,

09:54.598 --> 09:57.947
as dictated by the code
of the Jaguar Warrior.

09:58.033 --> 10:00.570
Well, dictate to him
that he's standin' too close.

10:09.946 --> 10:11.652
Back off.

10:14.816 --> 10:16.653
Her vest is full of venom.

10:16.753 --> 10:19.089
Any little bit of sun, flame,

10:19.188 --> 10:21.891
or even a spark'll
set that shit right off.

10:21.992 --> 10:24.294
Nasty. Especially for Xibalbans.

10:24.393 --> 10:27.297
- You come prepared.
- I was an Eagle Scout.

10:28.730 --> 10:30.297
All we need are her ashes.

10:31.185 --> 10:33.136
Well, it's awful windy.

10:33.235 --> 10:35.705
I'd hate for somebody to get blown away.

10:35.805 --> 10:37.574
Now show me my family.

10:42.679 --> 10:43.918
Let us pray.

10:44.779 --> 10:45.749
Let's go.

10:50.885 --> 10:52.288
Zolo.

11:07.936 --> 11:11.240
Okay... they're heading to the church.

11:12.307 --> 11:13.842
Right on time.

11:17.879 --> 11:19.249
I see it all now.

11:19.349 --> 11:21.318
Yeah? What's that?

11:21.417 --> 11:23.586
The Ranger was your
inside man this whole time.

11:23.686 --> 11:25.721
When you took me aside in the prison,

11:25.821 --> 11:28.258
you were letting him
stage the kidnapping.

11:29.258 --> 11:30.709
Bravo.

11:31.661 --> 11:33.630
Yeah, we trucked in
a few other surprises, too.

11:35.664 --> 11:38.033
For now, the Ranger's gonna distract
them while we get into position.

11:38.133 --> 11:41.071
Then he's gonna open the tunnel
access to the church,

11:41.171 --> 11:43.940
we can ambush from the inside.

11:44.039 --> 11:46.108
That's a lot of trust to put in one man.

11:46.209 --> 11:47.611
Yep.

11:48.710 --> 11:50.463
And you still don't trust me.

11:51.719 --> 11:53.187
I do not.

12:02.224 --> 12:03.893
Everybody ready?

12:04.893 --> 12:06.229
Good luck, Gecko.

12:07.462 --> 12:08.998
Let's go.

12:11.357 --> 12:12.669
Is that what I think it is?

12:12.768 --> 12:13.702
Yes.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.309
Let's finish this.

12:20.909 --> 12:22.411
See you at the church.

12:29.719 --> 12:31.054
I have someone else.

12:33.822 --> 12:35.024
Head back.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.248
Look at you.

13:33.916 --> 13:35.318
You've changed.

13:35.417 --> 13:39.188
You're no longer that
scared little slave girl.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.357
I liked her.

13:42.457 --> 13:44.388
And you're the same.

13:45.860 --> 13:47.330
Still bitter.

13:47.556 --> 13:49.525
Well, I'll be satisfied today.

13:51.770 --> 13:53.268
You made the right choice, Ranger.

13:53.369 --> 13:57.139
- Nuh-uh. I need guarantees.
- Good men get rewarded.

13:57.239 --> 13:59.908
I want me and my family out
when the shit goes down.

14:00.008 --> 14:03.278
But don't you want to stay
and find out what happens next?

14:03.378 --> 14:05.882
No. I don't want in your club.

14:05.981 --> 14:07.116
Peacekeeper...

14:08.183 --> 14:09.518
you're already in.

15:09.878 --> 15:13.182
Draw their fire from the church,
just so we get shot at?

15:13.282 --> 15:16.219
The key component of that
is not getting hit.

15:16.319 --> 15:19.155
If you were more durable, I wouldn't
have to take as many bullets for you.

15:19.254 --> 15:21.557
Well, we all have
our weaknesses, don't we?

15:21.657 --> 15:24.393
What the hell do you wanna do? Do you
wanna sit around and watch the sunset?

15:24.494 --> 15:27.263
- Yeah. I'd prefer that.
- Don't you worry.

15:27.363 --> 15:29.265
You and I are gonna
Butch-and-Sundance our way

15:29.364 --> 15:32.568
right through this town,
come out the other side.

15:34.202 --> 15:37.105
- You do know they both died, right?
- Freeze framed!

15:37.205 --> 15:38.340
They freeze-framed!

15:39.198 --> 15:40.475
Those guys lived forever.

15:46.648 --> 15:48.116
Shit.

15:48.216 --> 15:50.252
What... what the fuck is that?

16:06.302 --> 16:07.269
Shit!

16:13.109 --> 16:14.244
Stop!

16:31.460 --> 16:33.061
They must've followed me here.

16:33.162 --> 16:34.596
You're a terrible liar.

16:35.192 --> 16:38.234
Blow me up! Kill her!

16:38.334 --> 16:40.169
- Do it!
- Yes, do it!

16:40.268 --> 16:43.339
Destroy this body! Destroy yourself!

16:43.438 --> 16:45.908
But I'll come back,
in one form or another,

16:46.672 --> 16:48.543
and everything you love
will be turned to dust.

16:59.619 --> 17:00.758
Oops.

17:08.029 --> 17:09.330
Freddie!

17:09.431 --> 17:11.334
Freddie!

17:11.433 --> 17:13.201
You okay? Are you okay?

17:13.300 --> 17:15.369
Okay. Yeah.

17:20.342 --> 17:22.378
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

17:32.683 --> 17:35.124
How many guys we got left?

17:46.768 --> 17:49.972
I count four shooters.
Take that guy out!

18:12.126 --> 18:14.229
Aah!

18:14.329 --> 18:16.031
This isn't looking too hot.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.343
I'm gonna need you to run point.

18:24.472 --> 18:27.143
That's just code for, "Hey, Richie,
why don't you walk out there first

18:27.242 --> 18:29.011
and take a bullet!"
It still hurts like hell!

18:31.881 --> 18:33.783
You know, if I gotta put
up with you bein' a bloodsucker,

18:33.883 --> 18:36.184
you'd think I could take advantage
of the perks every once in a while.

18:38.887 --> 18:41.089
- I'm not gonna be the bait.
- We're both bait! That was the plan!

18:50.298 --> 18:53.568
God. I hope the "B" Team's
having better luck.

19:17.558 --> 19:18.951
Which way?

19:19.862 --> 19:21.497
So, uh...

19:22.897 --> 19:24.566
I'm gonna say right.

19:24.666 --> 19:26.134
Go left.

19:29.371 --> 19:31.107
Are you people gonna ever trust me?

19:34.308 --> 19:36.445
Go that way. Go.

19:48.789 --> 19:51.094
It's one of Amaru's slaves.

19:58.767 --> 20:01.203
I think we kicked the anthill.
Let's get outta here.

20:01.304 --> 20:03.706
- Go, go, go. We'll take care of it.
- OK. Let's go!

20:32.267 --> 20:33.903
I'll take my guys across the street.

20:34.002 --> 20:35.337
Right.

20:41.309 --> 20:43.546
I think we got their attention now.

20:43.645 --> 20:45.480
These venom bullets
are really doin' the trick.

20:46.480 --> 20:47.616
What happens when we run out?

21:18.313 --> 21:21.417
- Ah, f...
- Put your mask back on!

21:23.551 --> 21:26.388
- I'm holding my breath here.
- What?

21:26.489 --> 21:27.890
I can keep from burning up if I focus,

21:27.989 --> 21:30.226
but it's only for so long,
so hurry it up!

21:30.326 --> 21:32.894
- Those guys came outta nowhere.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

21:32.995 --> 21:35.698
Well, on the bright side,

21:35.797 --> 21:37.767
there's only one of those fuckers left.

21:37.866 --> 21:39.335
Aah!

21:39.434 --> 21:40.936
He's in that storefront back there.

21:42.805 --> 21:43.906
Aah!

21:47.308 --> 21:48.476
Aah!

21:50.812 --> 21:54.617
Ohh, great. Thundarr the Barbarian.

21:58.592 --> 22:00.261
I'll lead him out of town.

22:01.056 --> 22:02.424
We got a score to settle.

22:04.326 --> 22:05.627
Don't do anything heroic.

22:05.728 --> 22:07.363
Trust me, brother.

23:13.428 --> 23:15.998
Aah! Aah!

23:20.768 --> 23:23.005
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:23.104 --> 23:25.074
Now, this is not a fair fight.

23:25.173 --> 23:26.776
I've read about you Jag Warriors.

23:26.875 --> 23:28.477
I know you're all about some...

23:28.576 --> 23:30.845
code of honor, or some bullshit.

23:51.599 --> 23:54.769
- They're all children.
- Yeah.

23:57.132 --> 23:59.441
Look at what this so-called queen does.

24:00.861 --> 24:02.296
Enslaving us again.

24:02.978 --> 24:06.481
Forcing us to... kill our own.

24:06.582 --> 24:07.983
You made a deal with Brasa.

24:08.083 --> 24:09.485
I did.

24:10.684 --> 24:12.387
And then I found out she was here.

24:12.824 --> 24:14.981
Someone to rule the world, right?

24:15.490 --> 24:17.759
Wouldn't you love a place next to her.

24:19.193 --> 24:22.688
I don't want Amaru to rule
this world. I want you.

24:24.966 --> 24:26.602
That was your dream.

24:44.487 --> 24:47.890
Culebras. This is your <i>Diosa.</i>

24:49.924 --> 24:51.594
We serve Amaru.

24:55.229 --> 24:56.931
Not anymore.

25:09.009 --> 25:10.712
Do you remember...

25:12.113 --> 25:15.116
the river of blood in Xibalba...

25:17.219 --> 25:19.721
where I'd take you to bathe me?

25:22.891 --> 25:25.027
I don't want to remember.

25:29.197 --> 25:31.200
For you, it has been centuries.

25:32.867 --> 25:34.202
For me, it was yesterday.

25:35.983 --> 25:39.474
Yesterday, I still loved you.

25:40.256 --> 25:44.212
A slave can't love her master, remember?

25:44.313 --> 25:48.517
But she can steal, lie,

25:48.616 --> 25:49.951
deceive.

25:51.070 --> 25:52.535
Can't she?

25:53.631 --> 25:55.524
You lured me to my death.

25:57.224 --> 25:59.761
I trusted you and you betrayed me.

26:05.933 --> 26:07.936
So now, before you die...

26:12.740 --> 26:14.609
admit it to me.

26:16.210 --> 26:18.402
Admit that you loved me.

26:19.713 --> 26:21.706
That you worshipped me.

26:23.551 --> 26:24.953
I played the part.

26:27.087 --> 26:29.258
To free my people.

26:35.729 --> 26:37.232
Now I'll enslave them again.

26:40.101 --> 26:42.004
It's time to bring back order.

26:42.104 --> 26:44.672
My people don't like chains.

26:46.607 --> 26:49.210
They'll fight you to the death.

26:54.556 --> 26:56.392
I'm counting on it.

27:00.287 --> 27:02.191
You know, I might have taken you back...

27:04.563 --> 27:06.694
if I didn't have to kill you.

27:08.963 --> 27:10.732
I won't give you the satisfaction.

27:44.265 --> 27:47.002
Freddie? Freddie, what are you doing?

28:12.393 --> 28:13.647
They're coming.

28:15.487 --> 28:18.633
We're almost there. I just
want to run through this.

28:18.733 --> 28:20.802
No, kid, come on. We gotta keep going.

28:20.903 --> 28:23.872
Let's check the blood. We might
need that for transfusions.

28:26.775 --> 28:28.110
They're closing in on us.

28:30.245 --> 28:33.148
Burt. Burt?

28:33.248 --> 28:35.651
Hey, buddy, listen.

28:35.750 --> 28:37.987
You got a serious play in this, man.

28:38.506 --> 28:39.954
- We don't have time...
- Hey, Burt!

28:40.055 --> 28:43.292
Listen, old-timer.
Are you paying attention?!

28:43.392 --> 28:46.394
We don't have time to save a single
life, we have to save millions.

28:46.495 --> 28:48.631
This is not about that one little girl.

28:48.730 --> 28:49.864
It is for me!

28:52.835 --> 28:55.970
Guys! Hey! Goddamn it, stop it!

28:56.070 --> 28:59.774
I know it sucks, kid,
but everybody loses someone.

30:44.912 --> 30:48.083
Well, that's as fair
as it was gonna get.

30:51.318 --> 30:53.154
You ready to go for a ride?

30:54.322 --> 30:56.325
This isn't over yet.

31:03.331 --> 31:05.267
Shit!

31:31.993 --> 31:33.028
Whoa.

31:33.127 --> 31:35.096
Oh, Jesus Christ.

31:36.431 --> 31:39.968
- You got any guys left?
- We're the last two.

31:41.435 --> 31:43.271
Hopefully three.

31:46.140 --> 31:48.076
You're out of bullets.

31:48.175 --> 31:49.811
Yes, I am.

31:52.614 --> 31:55.316
I've been reloading off of
these undead <i>pistoleros.</i>

31:58.051 --> 32:00.421
Let's bag this Marlboro motherfucker.

32:00.521 --> 32:01.489
Whoa!

32:03.025 --> 32:04.258
Ohh!

32:08.609 --> 32:09.578
Oops.

32:14.635 --> 32:16.171
<i>Adios,</i> Machado.

32:19.941 --> 32:20.909
Shit!

33:14.127 --> 33:16.597
Leave the body.

33:16.698 --> 33:19.301
Embrace the fires.

33:19.401 --> 33:22.938
Blood eyes. Heart expires.

33:23.037 --> 33:25.239
Burning flesh on funeral pyres.

33:26.507 --> 33:29.945
The soul walks to Xibalba.
Leave the body...

33:30.045 --> 33:32.180
Maggie, we gotta get outta
here if we wanna make it.

33:32.279 --> 33:33.614
...heart expires.

33:33.714 --> 33:36.217
- Maggie?
- Burning flesh on funeral pyres.

33:36.317 --> 33:38.319
The soul walks to Xibalba.

33:49.998 --> 33:53.085
_

33:54.368 --> 33:55.937
La Diosa <i>has come for you!</i>

33:56.927 --> 33:59.682
This day you will rise against the power

33:59.783 --> 34:01.442
that has kept our ancestors slaves!

34:01.543 --> 34:03.712
We don't have time for this, Carlos.

34:03.812 --> 34:06.715
This is your army. This is how we win.

34:06.815 --> 34:08.716
If I cut them loose, they'll attack.

34:08.817 --> 34:11.553
They'll attack whoever you tell them to.

34:11.652 --> 34:13.487
These are your people.

34:13.587 --> 34:15.022
Trust them.

34:19.297 --> 34:21.568
What a lovely day for a revolution.

34:53.094 --> 34:54.495
Are you there, brother?

34:54.596 --> 34:57.632
<i>Bird dog, this is scarecrow.</i>

34:57.732 --> 35:00.335
- Where are you?!
- Out in the desert.

35:01.640 --> 35:02.909
I beat Zolo.

35:04.272 --> 35:05.540
Why are you whispering?

35:05.640 --> 35:07.142
Playing a little Tom and Jerry.

35:07.241 --> 35:08.776
<i>You the cat or the mouse?</i>

35:08.877 --> 35:10.645
I'm the rat,

35:10.745 --> 35:13.315
and I got the Sun God
nippin' at my tail.

35:13.415 --> 35:15.117
<i>I'd love to help, but I got
a little problem here.</i>

35:15.216 --> 35:17.118
<i>Car's outta commission,</i>

35:17.218 --> 35:19.720
<i>Zolo's friggin' bike won't
start unless he's on it.</i>

35:20.285 --> 35:24.359
I'm outta town, I've lost my mask.
It's a long way back.

35:24.459 --> 35:26.361
I don't think I'm gonna
make it to the party.

35:26.460 --> 35:28.062
Don't worry about it, all right?

35:28.163 --> 35:29.798
<i>If you're gonna burn up,
you just stay there.</i>

35:29.897 --> 35:32.066
<i>Don't risk it.</i>

35:32.167 --> 35:35.670
Look, if I can find a... Will you
shut the fuck up for one minute?!

35:35.770 --> 35:37.239
Aah!

35:41.241 --> 35:43.210
It was a dumb move. I shouldn't've left.

35:43.310 --> 35:46.280
Listen, buddy, we played our hand. Okay?

35:48.415 --> 35:50.285
We're gonna know better
next time, right?

35:50.384 --> 35:52.354
If there is a next time.

35:58.725 --> 36:01.062
<i>Where Eagles Dare.</i>

36:01.163 --> 36:02.264
Eastwood,

36:02.363 --> 36:04.265
<i>Burton.</i>

36:04.366 --> 36:08.236
Yeah, none of the cool
guys died in that one.

36:17.116 --> 36:18.653
I don't know, man.

36:20.413 --> 36:22.750
I don't think there's gonna
be a freeze frame today.

36:27.654 --> 36:29.191
Seth?

36:32.205 --> 36:33.407
Hiding?

36:35.495 --> 36:39.667
I, too, had to hide my true
form to survive in this realm.

36:41.435 --> 36:43.872
I loathed every minute of it.

36:46.239 --> 36:48.877
Like wearing an uncomfortable suit.

36:54.348 --> 36:57.652
I took the body of a pastor
when I first got here.

36:59.192 --> 37:00.727
I've grown bored of him.

37:01.788 --> 37:04.325
I was thinking of
taking the Peacekeeper's.

37:06.727 --> 37:09.163
His resistance to culebra venom,

37:09.263 --> 37:11.298
very useful to a Xibalban.

37:11.854 --> 37:13.401
But you, Seth Gecko...

37:14.670 --> 37:16.403
you'll do just fine.

37:22.642 --> 37:24.345
Oh, I see.

37:26.379 --> 37:27.914
It's the suit, right?

37:29.482 --> 37:31.113
Well, you can have it.

37:31.752 --> 37:35.789
Yeah, I think it'll look,
uh, a lot nicer than that

37:35.890 --> 37:37.792
late-'90s trench coat you're wearing.

37:38.385 --> 37:40.928
I'm afraid your brother
might not be joining us.

37:43.363 --> 37:45.466
I can see him through Zolo's eyes.

37:46.380 --> 37:49.204
Burning, burning in the desert sun.

37:50.337 --> 37:51.939
We might smell his ashes in the wind.

38:24.439 --> 38:25.674
It's too bad

38:25.774 --> 38:29.710
you won't be seeing Amaru's true beauty.

38:33.346 --> 38:34.615
But I will...

38:35.616 --> 38:36.785
through your eyes.

38:39.352 --> 38:41.522
Your explosives don't work on me.

38:43.389 --> 38:44.826
This one's special.

39:15.388 --> 39:16.890
Don't be alarmed.

39:17.924 --> 39:19.393
It's only human flesh.

39:20.393 --> 39:21.895
And flesh is weak.

39:23.797 --> 39:26.801
You picked a fight with the gods!

39:26.901 --> 39:30.705
You choose the most worthless
foot soldiers you could find!

39:30.805 --> 39:34.676
You can't even take two steps
without betraying the other!

39:34.776 --> 39:35.910
Tell me...

39:37.479 --> 39:39.614
...did you even have
a plan for defeating me?

39:42.149 --> 39:44.285
That's right, run!

39:45.118 --> 39:47.454
Run as far as you can!

39:56.096 --> 39:57.665
I'm not running.

40:04.872 --> 40:05.874
Fuck.

40:46.113 --> 40:48.649
Hey, <i>Eyes Wide Shut.</i>

40:50.484 --> 40:52.520
Is that all you got?

40:58.358 --> 40:59.860
Jesus.

41:00.027 --> 41:02.463
Not quite, but close.

41:02.488 --> 41:04.358
Hey. Get these things off me!

41:04.445 --> 41:06.248
Sorry, Ranger, I'm flying solo.

41:06.334 --> 41:07.568
What? We had a plan.

41:07.901 --> 41:11.939
The plan is for shit. I'm the plan.

41:16.810 --> 41:17.778
Damn.

42:15.694 --> 42:16.863
Scott!

42:31.852 --> 42:34.689
Kate. I know you're in there.

42:34.788 --> 42:36.691
Come out and save your brother.

42:36.790 --> 42:39.526
Kate, come out! Come back!

42:43.964 --> 42:44.966
Scott?

42:54.748 --> 42:56.417
- Margaret!
- No!

43:29.075 --> 43:30.210
Fuck.

44:09.283 --> 44:10.985
Bow your heads.
