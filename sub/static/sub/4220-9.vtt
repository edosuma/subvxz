WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:02.502
Let me teach you to cook.

00:02.795 --> 00:03.795
You're like...

00:04.421 --> 00:05.672
Like, perfect.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.509
I'll give them a week
and then tell Severide
they gotta...

00:09.593 --> 00:11.010
I like her.
What?

00:11.095 --> 00:13.763
He's happy.
What do I know?

00:15.474 --> 00:19.185
Losing my sister, experiencing
the pain of that loss...

00:19.603 --> 00:21.562
No one understands what
it's like but you, Kelly.

00:27.778 --> 00:30.363
Long weekend every
now and then with
the family isn't awful.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.823
Yeah. Yes, of course.

00:32.324 --> 00:33.324
Whoa.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.118
You okay?

00:35.244 --> 00:37.286
Oh, I think I heard
something pop.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.958
Hey, right here!
Hey! Hey!

00:43.085 --> 00:44.127
You faker.

00:48.632 --> 00:50.174
Back to the apartment?
Yeah.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.384
Come on.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.021
Why don't you ever answer
your mom's call?

01:04.523 --> 01:06.315
I talk to her plenty.

01:06.775 --> 01:10.278
Hey, I have Thanksgiving off.
Why don't we go to Florida,

01:10.362 --> 01:12.196
we meet
her and your dad?

01:12.281 --> 01:14.699
No, I don't want to
go home for Thanksgiving.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.200
You don't?

01:16.285 --> 01:19.162
Well, I just figured
I gotta meet the in-laws
sooner or later.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.496
I mean, my parents
aren't even there.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.249
They go on this Carnival
Cruise thing every year
with their friends.

01:23.333 --> 01:26.252
Let's just stay here.
Just you and me.

01:30.674 --> 01:31.758
Okay.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.050
Okay.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.135
Okay.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.344
Okay.

01:43.604 --> 01:47.523
Hey. Before we
transform into
Candidate and Lieutenant,

01:47.608 --> 01:48.816
give your girl a kiss.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.245
Morning, lovebirds.

02:09.546 --> 02:10.505
Morning.

02:10.589 --> 02:11.631
Hi!

02:18.764 --> 02:21.724
Mmm. I love this stuff.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.309
Never had it
before I got to Chicago,

02:23.393 --> 02:24.852
and now I'm obsessed.

02:24.937 --> 02:25.978
Yeah.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.105
I actually looked up
a bunch of Sriracha recipes.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.817
You can make extra spicy
buffalo wings with it,
and that sounded really fun.

02:30.901 --> 02:34.320
And you can use it to
make ice cubes in margaritas
and Bloody Marys.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.488
How cool is that?

02:36.615 --> 02:37.907
Pretty cool.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.660
See, this is why
I love cooking.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.746
You can get creative,
you can go anywhere with it.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.915
Speaking of going anywhere,

02:45.999 --> 02:49.377
how about we, uh,
grab some drinks
after Zumba tomorrow?

02:51.380 --> 02:53.089
Sure. We can meet up
at Molly's.

02:56.593 --> 03:00.221
Um, I was actually thinking
just you and me.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.727
A date.
Uh, I'm asking you
on a date.

03:11.775 --> 03:15.778
Cruz, I...
Joe, I don't...

03:19.449 --> 03:23.411
You... You're one of
my only good friends
here in Chicago.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.621
Let's not
mess that up, okay?

03:34.006 --> 03:35.590
Engine 51, truck 81,

03:35.674 --> 03:40.636
Squad 3, Ambulance 61.
Vehicle accident,
6,000 West 18th Street.

03:54.818 --> 03:55.860
Yeah?

03:55.944 --> 03:57.194
I don't know why the
safety shut-off didn't work.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.780
I didn't even know about
the leak till some drivers
started honking at me.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.073
What are you transporting?

04:01.158 --> 04:04.368
Hydrochloric acid. I put down
some sand bags to
try to contain it, but...

04:04.453 --> 04:06.871
All right, clear the area
right away. Get these
people back!

04:07.205 --> 04:08.205
Let's get back!

04:08.290 --> 04:09.540
We have a hydrochloric
acid spill.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.417
We're gonna need level two
HazMat response.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.252
Set up
a decontamination area.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.421
Fog line, scrub brushes,
and containment pools.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.589
Hey, guys, suit up.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.424
We're gonna have to
block off these sewers
with an earth dam.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.259
See what you can dig out
from around those trees,
all right?

04:20.344 --> 04:21.344
Copy that.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.429
We need to set up
a hot zone extending to
the far sidewalk.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.641
No one goes inside the zone
without SCBA
and protective gear.

05:08.392 --> 05:10.309
The Captain enlarged
the containment zone.

05:10.936 --> 05:11.936
How long is it gonna be?

05:12.854 --> 05:14.313
Dawson, what are you doing?

05:14.398 --> 05:16.190
Check out that dump truck.

05:18.568 --> 05:22.196
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey!

05:25.534 --> 05:28.327
Casey, HazMat will be here
in five.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.832
Hold on a minute.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.254
Is that Dawson driving
that truck?

05:39.339 --> 05:40.715
Yep, it is.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.158
Almost there!

06:09.911 --> 06:12.371
All right, Chief, we got
the valve fully shut.
It should be good

06:12.456 --> 06:14.206
until the chemical company
gets here.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.666
Copy that.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.508
Looks like you guys have
this under control.

06:26.762 --> 06:30.097
Uh, yeah. The area was
isolated, we've
contained the spill.

06:30.307 --> 06:33.559
We're gonna stay on
the scene until the response
team neutralizes the acid.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.734
Shouldn't your candidate
be in protective gear?

06:47.574 --> 06:49.825
The driver raised the chute
for me, showed me
how to release the sand.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.452
We'll talk at the firehouse.

07:00.462 --> 07:01.879
Hey!
Hey.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.214
What brings you here?

07:03.298 --> 07:04.298
Came to dognap this thing.

07:04.382 --> 07:05.966
She's kinda the greatest.

07:06.218 --> 07:08.052
You came for the dog?
Really?

07:08.136 --> 07:09.178
No.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.806
Twenty-four hours is
really a long time.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.015
Yeah, tell me about it.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.601
And you guys were gone
a long time. And I
think I've looked at

07:15.685 --> 07:17.770
pretty much every picture
and plaque on these walls.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.522
You guys like to
memorialize everything.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.941
Yeah, firefighters love to
get nostalgic.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.485
I don't think I saw
any pictures of Shay.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.863
Down at the end of
the hall.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.199
Will you show me?

07:32.077 --> 07:33.452
Yeah. Come on.

07:35.539 --> 07:38.874
Was Dawson following orders
when she drove through
the hot zone with no gear on?

07:39.751 --> 07:40.751
No, sir.

07:40.836 --> 07:42.461
We had the Chief at
the scene, he asked me

07:42.546 --> 07:44.713
why you were going easy
on your candidate.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.508
I know you don't
want those kind of
questions raised.

07:49.261 --> 07:52.138
If you are not comfortable
talking to Dawson
about her actions today,

07:52.222 --> 07:54.140
I am more than happy to have
that conversation with her.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.767
I'll take care of her, Chief.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.193
You wanted to see me,
Chief?

08:06.278 --> 08:09.864
Yeah. I was notified this
morning that you never
got your final follow-up exam

08:09.948 --> 08:11.157
with your eye injury.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.409
No worries. This baby blue
is working just fine.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.244
Yeah, the department,
they need the paperwork,

08:15.328 --> 08:16.829
otherwise they are gonna
sideline you.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.873
So go see the doctor now
and get it done.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.791
You got it, Chief.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.754
You never talk about her.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.090
You never talk
about Kathleen.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.178
I kind of thought
that was the deal.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.222
Yeah, I guess so.

08:37.767 --> 08:41.020
Hey, I wanna show you
something later,
if you're up for it.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.439
Sounds mysterious. I'm in.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.740
I know I should have
run the dump truck by
you first, but you were

08:52.824 --> 08:54.200
on the radio,
and I had to act fast.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.577
If you can't get
my go-ahead,
you don't do it.

08:57.329 --> 09:00.414
You ignored my order.
No one in the hot zone
without protective gear.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.542
Well, I was more on
perimeter of the hot zone...

09:03.627 --> 09:06.378
Gabby, it's one thing
to go off-book when
you're the PIC on ambo,

09:06.463 --> 09:09.423
but you're part of
a team now.
Under my command.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.800
Following orders is
not up for debate.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.427
I understand.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.433
But I did keep
the acid from spreading.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.395
That was pretty cowboy,
give me that at least.

09:25.941 --> 09:30.736
That is exactly the kind
of attitude that could get
us in serious trouble.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.072
Already might have,
considering another
Battalion Chief

09:33.156 --> 09:34.573
was there at the scene,

09:34.658 --> 09:35.824
saw it all go down.

09:37.327 --> 09:40.871
Would you have ignored
Boden's orders
like you did mine?

09:40.956 --> 09:42.331
Matt, come on.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.917
Gabby, what you did today
crossed the line,

09:45.001 --> 09:46.543
and made fools of both of us.

09:46.628 --> 09:50.214
And if it ever happens
again, I'll be forced to
kick you off Truck for good.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.799
Do you understand that?

09:53.677 --> 09:54.927
Yes, sir.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.327
Everything okay?

10:20.412 --> 10:23.372
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I was just, uh,

10:24.499 --> 10:27.418
thinking about if I wanted
to take a shower.

10:27.502 --> 10:29.169
Can't really
make up my mind.

10:29.879 --> 10:30.963
Okay.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.302
I'll leave you
to it, then.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.770
You guys still using
glass eyes these days?

10:47.022 --> 10:48.605
No, last 50 or so years,

10:48.690 --> 10:50.858
most artificial eyes are
made out of high-tech plastic.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.484
Can you look up
for me?

10:53.069 --> 10:54.528
They look as good as
the glass ones?

10:54.612 --> 10:55.779
Better.

10:55.864 --> 10:59.742
Hard to believe.
That Peter Falk, you know,
Columbo?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.076
Can you look down please?

11:01.828 --> 11:04.580
Sharp looking guy,
and he had a glass eye.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.584
Well, looks like your eye
healed up very nicely,
Mr. McHolland.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.793
You are good to go.

11:09.878 --> 11:13.589
Thanks, Doc. As my pops
used to say, "I owe you
a steak dinner."

11:13.757 --> 11:15.507
I'd love that!
How about Friday night?

11:15.592 --> 11:18.344
I can get
the paperwork done,
I'll bring it with.

11:18.428 --> 11:21.055
There is that new place
on Rush. Leone's.

11:25.310 --> 11:29.563
I... Oh, no.

11:33.777 --> 11:36.445
What's wrong, Mouchie?
They didn't clear you
for duty?

11:36.613 --> 11:39.698
Guys,
I don't know what happened.
I was just being friendly,

11:39.866 --> 11:41.283
asking about glass eyes,

11:41.368 --> 11:43.660
which is a bona fide
interest of mine,

11:43.745 --> 11:46.372
and all of a sudden
I have a date.

11:46.456 --> 11:47.498
Right?

11:47.582 --> 11:49.875
I was simply
expressing gratitude

11:49.959 --> 11:51.377
for how well
she fixed me up,

11:51.461 --> 11:53.045
and I said, "I owe you
a steak dinner,"

11:53.129 --> 11:55.214
and then she says,
"Let's go out Friday!"

11:55.298 --> 11:56.548
So you asked her out
to dinner.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.092
It's an expression!

11:58.176 --> 11:59.301
It is?

11:59.386 --> 12:00.552
Is she attractive?

12:00.637 --> 12:01.720
Herrmann,
Mouch is spoken for!

12:01.805 --> 12:02.805
You can't blame
Mouch for this.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.139
Why not?
Yeah, why not?

12:04.265 --> 12:05.474
Because he's got momentum
on his side.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.683
Nothing succeeds
like success.

12:06.768 --> 12:09.311
Oh, so nothing fails like
failure, is that what
you're saying?

12:09.479 --> 12:11.897
What? No, no, no.
I'm just saying, now that
Mouch is a taken man,

12:11.981 --> 12:14.066
he's like catnip
to other women.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.236
I'm a taken man.
I ain't got no lady doctors
throwing themselves at me.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.905
Trudy will
rip my head clean off
if she finds out

12:19.989 --> 12:21.115
I got a date with
another woman.

12:21.199 --> 12:22.282
I gotta get out of this.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.955
Joe Cruz, talk to me.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.791
About what?

12:30.875 --> 12:33.919
About the, uh, the...
The rain cloud that's
following you around.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.297
I got put in
the friend zone.

12:37.841 --> 12:38.924
By who?

12:40.677 --> 12:41.927
You don't know her.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.512
Ambulance 61, injured male,

12:43.596 --> 12:46.598
Cordova High School,
3317, South Garfield.

12:50.728 --> 12:54.606
Well, maybe,
whoever she is,

12:54.691 --> 12:57.192
she'll turn out to be
a really good friend.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.538
Over here! Hurry!

13:10.081 --> 13:14.209
Make him breathe, please!
Please make him breathe.

13:37.734 --> 13:38.984
Jason!

13:39.235 --> 13:40.402
Okay, come on up.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.489
You all right? You okay?
You all right, Jason?

13:43.865 --> 13:46.533
Stay right here,
sit there,
catch your breath, okay?

13:46.659 --> 13:47.659
What happened?

13:47.785 --> 13:48.994
You went into the pool,

13:49.078 --> 13:50.579
and then suddenly
you stopped moving.

13:50.705 --> 13:52.039
You were, like, floating.

13:52.582 --> 13:55.626
Pressure's good,
lungs are clear.

13:56.419 --> 13:57.753
How are you feeling, Jason?

13:57.837 --> 13:59.254
I'm okay, I guess.

14:00.423 --> 14:03.675
Yeah? Um, we're gonna
get you up nice and slow,
all right?

14:03.801 --> 14:05.344
Right on to the stretcher.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.264
Okay, good.
There we go, buddy.

14:14.604 --> 14:15.646
Is he gonna be okay?

14:15.730 --> 14:17.606
That CPR you did
saved his life.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.775
I was a lifeguard
this summer.

14:19.943 --> 14:23.111
Alexis, just, please,
don't tell my father.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.280
Danny already called him.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.406
Oh, no.

14:26.491 --> 14:27.533
Dude, we thought
you were dead.

14:27.617 --> 14:28.784
Jason!

14:30.036 --> 14:32.246
Hey, sir, he was unconscious
for a few minutes,

14:32.330 --> 14:34.456
he seems to be lucid now
and breathing fine
on his own.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.626
We're gonna take him to
the hospital where they can
do a full exam on him there.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.710
You okay?

14:38.795 --> 14:39.795
I'm fine, Dad. Really.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.505
What hospital?
Chicago Med.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.387
Your friends didn't waste
any time calling your dad,
huh?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.848
They know.
Family's everything to him.

14:54.352 --> 14:57.479
Easy on the talking.
Breathe nice and slow
for me.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.237
Hey, I'm hearing rales.
I'm gonna take
his blood pressure.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.863
Do what you can
to get us there fast.

15:06.948 --> 15:07.990
Copy that.

15:15.498 --> 15:16.748
I'm not getting a blood
pressure.

15:16.833 --> 15:17.958
Five away, Mills.

15:18.042 --> 15:21.587
Damn it! Secondary drowning!
Call back Chicago Med,
let them know

15:21.671 --> 15:22.838
he's going into
respiratory arrest!

15:23.047 --> 15:24.715
Chicago Med,
this is Ambulance 61.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.925
Our patient just coded
and went into cardiac arrest.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.093
Our ETA is
a minute out.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.595
Copy that, ambulance 61.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.430
Preparing for your arrival.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.852
He's arresting!

15:38.146 --> 15:40.772
Charging! Clear!

15:51.367 --> 15:55.495
I'm pushing epi!
Come on, buddy!
Come on!

15:57.540 --> 16:02.878
Come on, Jason.
Come on, buddy.
Come on, Jason.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.803
Pulmonary edema,
he's in PEA.
Been about six minutes.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.181
He was resuscitated
at the scene, but went into
arrest en route.

16:14.265 --> 16:15.307
We gave him one epi.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.352
We've got it.
Okay, on my count.
One, two, three.

16:21.939 --> 16:22.981
Check for pulse.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.149
I got nothing.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.610
Continue compressions.
Check respirations.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.362
Got nothing yet.

16:28.905 --> 16:32.115
Stop compressions.
Let's get another epi
in here.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.325
Pushing it.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.410
Come on.

16:36.287 --> 16:37.412
Is there a pulse?

16:37.497 --> 16:38.872
No pulse.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.000
Is there a pulse?

16:42.085 --> 16:43.085
No pulse.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.252
Still no pulse.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.843
I'm calling it.
Everybody agree?

16:51.969 --> 16:55.514
Yeah.
11:40.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.442
There was no more
you could do.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.716
Yo. What's going on?
Guess the kid that got
brought in was Jason Lullo,

17:30.800 --> 17:32.134
Papa Lullo's son.

17:33.428 --> 17:34.720
Who is that?

17:34.804 --> 17:36.805
Papers call him
the John Gotti of Chicago.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.600
Come on.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.438
Hey.
Hey.

17:48.443 --> 17:50.610
Tomorrow night.
Get a bite to eat
with me?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.238
I thought you were
working at Molly's.

17:53.322 --> 17:54.990
Right. You're right.
I am.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.619
I could ask Herrmann
to close out for me.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.332
All right.
Well, let me know.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.502
Yeah, I will.

18:15.011 --> 18:18.889
Uh, this is pointless.
We all know she likes me best.
I'm her soulmate.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.308
Twenty-five bucks says
she comes to me first.

18:22.101 --> 18:26.605
Okay, ready?
Three, two, go!

18:26.689 --> 18:28.064
Pouch!

18:28.191 --> 18:29.483
Hey, come here, Pouch!
Come to Papa!

18:29.567 --> 18:31.318
Who's a good girl?
Who's a good girl?

18:38.743 --> 18:39.868
What happened?

18:41.037 --> 18:42.370
We lost a kid.

18:45.541 --> 18:46.625
Sorry to hear that.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.017
Oh. Mmm.

19:14.862 --> 19:20.283
The boy's girlfriend
was so relieved
that he was all right.

19:22.453 --> 19:24.412
I told her
she saved his life.

19:26.541 --> 19:31.419
I picked up some wings.
I thought we could try out
that recipe?

19:32.547 --> 19:33.922
Happy to help out.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.174
You know I make
a great sous chef.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.185
Do we have butter?

19:48.646 --> 19:49.813
Check.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.988
Butter.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.159
You've heard about
the Great Fire of 1871,
right?

20:03.244 --> 20:04.202
They teach you that
in Tallahassee?

20:04.287 --> 20:07.038
Yeah, something about a cow
kicking over a lantern.

20:07.123 --> 20:10.792
Yeah, Mrs. O'Leary's cow.
The fire burned
for an entire day,

20:10.877 --> 20:13.420
and it leveled about
three-and-a-half square miles
of Chicago.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.714
It was, like,
the end of the world,

20:15.798 --> 20:18.174
and it all took place
right at this spot.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.635
Right here?

20:20.887 --> 20:24.890
Well, the Academy is
actually built on the site
of Mrs. O'Leary's barn,

20:24.974 --> 20:27.058
but the cow part, eh...

20:29.812 --> 20:31.646
Chicago had to
totally rebuild.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.191
Now fire's a part
of its DNA.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.488
And this is where I learned
all about firefighting.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.370
I learned as much about
protecting people from Shay

20:47.455 --> 20:50.665
as I did from
any instructor
at the Academy.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.417
Yeah?

20:52.501 --> 20:53.877
Yeah.

21:00.176 --> 21:04.012
It's her badge.
Shay was intense.

21:06.057 --> 21:09.017
She'd do anything to protect
the people she loved.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.271
I wish I'd known her.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.025
Me, too.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.782
Thank you
for sharing all this.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.868
You kidding me?

21:28.412 --> 21:31.164
I wouldn't be here at all
if it wasn't for you.

21:35.378 --> 21:37.963
I couldn't even
come down here
to see this until now.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.311
I was driving the car.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.776
When my sister got killed.
I was...

22:01.445 --> 22:02.737
I was driving the car.

22:05.700 --> 22:06.700
Babe.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.588
My parents aren't
on a cruise.

22:22.216 --> 22:24.259
I just couldn't
go home and face them.

22:27.555 --> 22:29.014
It was an accident.

22:29.098 --> 22:32.934
I just keep thinking
about seeing

22:34.103 --> 22:38.273
the lights coming at us,
and wondering why they were
on the wrong side of the road.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.194
It's not fair.

22:45.906 --> 22:48.450
I walk away
with six stitches,

22:50.661 --> 22:52.370
and Kathleen dies.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.499
Hey.

23:01.922 --> 23:04.132
We see this kind of thing
all the time.

23:06.469 --> 23:09.637
One random moment or move,

23:09.722 --> 23:12.515
and this person lives,
or that person dies.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.478
You can play "what if"
all you want.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.814
What if it was
two inches to the left?

23:19.899 --> 23:22.400
Or what if it was
a split-second later?

23:22.485 --> 23:25.236
You'll drive yourself crazy
wondering.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.825
Your parents
can't blame you
for what happened.

23:34.455 --> 23:35.747
And neither can you.

24:07.029 --> 24:10.281
You! You son of a bitch!

24:10.366 --> 24:11.574
Hey, hold on, man.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.536
You killed my son!
You killed my son!
Buddy! Hey, hold on!

24:14.995 --> 24:16.788
I, I understand, Mr. Lullo,
that you're upset...

24:16.872 --> 24:18.498
You understand nothing.

24:18.582 --> 24:22.252
I just came from the morgue,
identifying my only son!

24:22.336 --> 24:24.087
What could you possibly
understand about that?

24:24.171 --> 24:26.464
You're... You're right.
I cannot comprehend what
you're going through,

24:26.549 --> 24:28.216
but I do know what your
son went through.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.426
I was with him
the entire time,
all right?

24:30.511 --> 24:33.388
All I know is he went
into that ambulance alive,

24:33.472 --> 24:35.682
and he came out dead,
and that's on your ass!

24:35.766 --> 24:39.060
That's, that's secondary
drowning, okay?
A pulmonary edema.

24:39.145 --> 24:41.980
Look, I heard enough from
the doctors. I don't wanna
hear your pathetic excuses!

24:42.064 --> 24:43.356
Hey! Hey!
Hey!

24:43.440 --> 24:45.775
Mr. Lullo! Mr. Lullo,
you're upset. Why don't
you get back in the car?

24:45.860 --> 24:48.027
Mr. Lullo, I'm sorry,
I can't let you do this.
I'm sorry, Mr. Lullo.

24:48.112 --> 24:49.863
I tried everything
to save your boy.

24:49.947 --> 24:51.906
And I wish that
I could have saved him.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.243
I'm... I'm sorry.

25:01.584 --> 25:02.750
You're dead.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.357
Lullo is the real deal.

25:26.442 --> 25:27.901
You gotta stay
on your toes for a while.

25:27.985 --> 25:29.569
If you want to
press charges...
No.

25:29.653 --> 25:32.197
No, look, he's...
He's a grieving father.

25:32.281 --> 25:33.948
Who can blame him
for losing his cool?

25:34.033 --> 25:36.201
Mills, this is not
the type of threat that
you let go by.

25:36.285 --> 25:40.079
I would really rather
just talk to him, you know?
Wait until he calms down.

25:40.164 --> 25:41.289
Bad idea.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.416
Mills, I'm not asking you,
I am telling you.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.711
You let Detective Halstead
deal with this.
You stay away from him.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.727
Uh, you never showed up
to Molly's last night.

26:03.896 --> 26:07.482
I had to go back
to the Porter site, get
that balcony finished up.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.486
It was a long day,
and I was wiped out.

26:12.655 --> 26:14.030
Totally, yeah.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.657
Sorry I got home
after you crashed.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.161
Um...

26:21.080 --> 26:24.374
I was hoping we could talk
about what happened
last shift.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.543
I'm not sure
that's a great idea.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.464
Well, I don't mean
boss to candidate,
I mean fiance to fiancee.

26:32.258 --> 26:35.843
That was a pretty
rough shift.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.394
I messed up, badly,

26:44.478 --> 26:47.313
and was told that
if I did it again
I might lose my job.

26:47.398 --> 26:50.024
It'd be nice to talk about
that with the guy I love.

26:52.152 --> 26:54.404
In theory, I get that.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.282
But it's not like I can
change the way I feel

26:57.366 --> 26:59.534
about your behavior
on shift just because
we're at home.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.745
This is tough
for both of us.

27:04.873 --> 27:07.375
I know it is,
but, Matt, it's...

27:08.794 --> 27:10.712
If we can't talk about things
when they get tough,

27:10.796 --> 27:12.463
how is this
ever gonna work?

27:26.562 --> 27:28.062
Guess I'll see you later.

27:29.732 --> 27:31.065
Yeah.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.371
Hey.

27:48.584 --> 27:51.919
Yeah, I...
I'm sorry about that.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.589
Things have just been
a little crazy here, and...

27:58.135 --> 28:02.138
I know. I really miss
you too, Mom.

28:13.650 --> 28:17.362
First I had to get myself
appropriately psyched up for
the conversation, which I did.

28:17.446 --> 28:20.531
Then I called her office
and said,
"May I speak to Dr. Lu?"

28:20.616 --> 28:23.910
Which made me realize,
I don't even know
her first name.

28:23.994 --> 28:25.620
Cut to the chase, Mouch.

28:25.704 --> 28:29.624
Right. So, she finally
gets on the line
and I am ready to tell her,

28:29.708 --> 28:32.001
"I can't have dinner
with you."

28:32.086 --> 28:33.378
Why do I get the feeling
that never happened?

28:33.462 --> 28:35.338
Chief, I couldn't
get the words out.

28:36.006 --> 28:40.218
She sounded so excited,
and I didn't want to send her
on some downward spiral.

28:40.302 --> 28:43.596
Apparently doctors have
a very high rate of
depression.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.056
Optometrists do?

28:45.140 --> 28:47.517
Oh, I believe she's
an ophthalmologist.

28:47.601 --> 28:48.893
Mouch, you have
got to cancel.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.895
Trudy is not
the type of woman
who can be trifled with.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.522
I know. You're right.

28:52.606 --> 28:54.107
Wait. Hold on a second.

28:54.191 --> 28:55.400
Mouch is a grown man.

28:55.484 --> 28:58.736
Trudy's got no right
to tell him who he can and
cannot break bread with.

28:58.821 --> 29:00.279
There's a certain amount
of logic to that.

29:00.364 --> 29:01.781
I told you not to get
Chief involved.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.616
You don't need to
add this to your
plate of concerns.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.410
Just forget the whole thing
happened and...

29:05.494 --> 29:06.744
Mouch, I outrank him.

29:06.829 --> 29:08.621
When I say
that you have to cancel,
you have to cancel.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.164
And that is an order.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.624
When you're right,
you're right.

29:18.298 --> 29:21.426
You know what?
The two of you, get out
of my office. Now!

29:23.178 --> 29:24.846
Trudy did not
put a ring on it.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.139
I know.
You're right.

29:28.225 --> 29:32.270
Truck 81, Truck 66,
Squad 3, Ambo 61.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.981
Structure fire,
2000, South Collegiate.

29:46.368 --> 29:48.035
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Hurry up!

29:50.289 --> 29:51.956
Hurry up! My wife,
she's still in the office!

29:52.040 --> 29:53.958
Just your wife?
No customers?

29:54.042 --> 29:56.043
No, just... Just her.
Please hurry!
She was in the office!

29:56.170 --> 29:58.629
Where's the office?
It's in the back!
It's all the way in back!

29:58.714 --> 30:00.047
What do we have here?

30:00.132 --> 30:01.757
We've got one victim
inside, probably in
the back office.

30:01.842 --> 30:04.135
We don't have long before
that truss roof comes down.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.304
Cruz, Otis,
try and enter from the back.

30:06.388 --> 30:08.055
On it.
No, but...

30:08.140 --> 30:09.640
But the office is
straight back.

30:09.725 --> 30:11.559
Look, it's not far.
Look, I'll show you!

30:11.643 --> 30:14.479
Sir! Sir, you can't go in
there, the roof
is about to collapse.

30:14.563 --> 30:16.105
They'll get her from
the back entrance.

30:16.190 --> 30:19.233
But what if she's not there?
What if she tried to come back
this way?

30:20.110 --> 30:21.736
Chief, let me take
a man in and see.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.029
I don't like it, Casey.

30:23.113 --> 30:24.572
Please, man, please!

30:24.698 --> 30:28.743
Please, please, help my
wife, Michelle. Please.
I'll go with you.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.705
Chief, let us go halfway in.
We'll turn right around.
Thirty seconds, tops.

30:33.207 --> 30:35.124
Cruz, Otis,
what have you got?

30:35.209 --> 30:36.292
Can't get in yet.

30:36.376 --> 30:38.836
Having trouble with the door.
Let's get a saw back here.

30:38.921 --> 30:40.379
Got it, Chief!

30:42.424 --> 30:43.841
Hey! Hey! Hey, sir!

30:43.926 --> 30:46.385
Hey!
Hey! Go get him!

30:47.804 --> 30:49.555
- Herrmann, thermal cam!
- Got it!

30:50.599 --> 30:52.391
All right, Dawson,
it's you and me.

30:52.476 --> 30:55.228
Stay close,
within arm's reach.
You got that?

30:55.312 --> 30:56.354
I got it.

30:56.438 --> 30:58.648
He didn't get far,
I can tell you that much.

31:03.403 --> 31:04.987
Ready? Let's go.
Yeah.

31:14.331 --> 31:17.124
Hey, buddy!
Where'd you go?

31:21.630 --> 31:23.881
Hey! Look for footsteps.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.341
Got it!

31:34.476 --> 31:35.977
Fire department!
Hold on!

31:41.984 --> 31:43.150
I got something.

31:49.199 --> 31:51.158
Casey!
I think I found him!

31:52.160 --> 31:53.536
Dawson, where the hell
did you go?

32:10.095 --> 32:12.471
I found him!
Next aisle over!

32:27.070 --> 32:28.362
Hey, I got him.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.698
Come on.
Right here, buddy.

32:31.825 --> 32:33.451
That was a bad move, pal.

32:33.827 --> 32:35.161
You gotta let us
do our job.

32:35.245 --> 32:36.912
I don't want to live
without her.

32:36.997 --> 32:39.248
- Okay, don't speak, buddy.
- Just take a deep breath.

32:39.333 --> 32:41.083
Just... Come on.
Breathe in.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.340
Michelle!

32:49.468 --> 32:52.386
Michelle!
Michelle! Oh, baby!

32:52.471 --> 32:54.555
Tucker! Oh!

32:54.681 --> 32:57.183
Guy must have lost his mind,
running in there like that.

32:57.267 --> 33:01.228
Nah. That's marriage, brother.
I'd do anything for Cindy,

33:01.313 --> 33:03.648
no matter what might
happen to me.

33:19.039 --> 33:20.247
I need to go home.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.046
Yeah, you do.

33:28.924 --> 33:31.425
I was kind of hoping
you'd fight me on that one.

33:33.261 --> 33:37.515
Before I met you I was
doing whatever I could

33:37.599 --> 33:39.100
to keep Shay
out of my head.

33:40.352 --> 33:44.939
Went out drinking and
partying every night.
That was my escape.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.234
But then I met you.

33:51.571 --> 33:53.197
But the thing
I realized is

33:54.032 --> 33:55.449
I'm your escape.

33:57.619 --> 33:59.912
And as long as you're
here with me,

34:00.497 --> 34:02.915
you're not gonna go home
and face your family.

34:06.503 --> 34:09.130
But that's the only way
you're gonna
get through this.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.470
I really liked
being here with you.

34:19.224 --> 34:21.809
I'd keep you here forever
if I could.

34:22.185 --> 34:23.269
I really would.

34:26.565 --> 34:30.234
But that'd be for me.
Not for you.

34:54.217 --> 34:55.426
Trudy.

35:07.022 --> 35:10.357
Trudy, I can explain.
I'm not supposed to
be here.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.359
I mean, I am,
but it's all...

35:12.444 --> 35:14.820
It's a big
misunderstanding.

35:14.905 --> 35:17.740
Maybe you shouldn't
record your
misunderstandings

35:17.824 --> 35:19.366
in your Filofax, hon.

35:21.369 --> 35:25.122
I know how it looks,
but when Dr. Lu gets here,
you can ask her yourself...

35:25.207 --> 35:26.290
Kim's not coming.

35:26.374 --> 35:27.458
Her name is Kim?

35:28.376 --> 35:30.211
I paid a visit
to her office.

35:32.047 --> 35:34.715
What did you tell her?

35:34.883 --> 35:37.927
I told her it was all
a big misunderstanding.

35:38.011 --> 35:41.597
And she gave me
your CFD clearance.

35:51.233 --> 35:54.777
See, this is why we're
perfect together.

35:54.861 --> 35:57.488
You can make the calls
that I can't.

36:04.371 --> 36:08.290
You're buying me
a very big Porterhouse
steak tonight.

36:09.334 --> 36:10.417
Waiter.

36:12.254 --> 36:14.672
- Mmm. Dawson!
- Mmm?

36:14.756 --> 36:15.840
Next round's on me.

36:15.924 --> 36:17.007
Fine by me.

36:19.761 --> 36:20.761
Hey.

36:23.139 --> 36:25.933
I've dated a lot of jerks
my whole life.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.435
I'm sorry to hear that.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.646
Well, not as sorry
as I am.

36:33.567 --> 36:37.152
I've never been out
with someone who was
actually nice to me.

36:37.237 --> 36:38.487
It's crazy, huh?

36:38.572 --> 36:40.531
Oh, I'm not one to judge.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.325
I've never really had
the best instincts
for this kind of stuff.

36:44.244 --> 36:45.661
I think you do.

36:48.498 --> 36:52.376
I think you and me
going out on a date

36:52.460 --> 36:55.296
could be
a really good idea.

36:59.634 --> 37:01.510
Yeah?
Yeah.

37:56.775 --> 37:57.983
No.

38:00.362 --> 38:01.403
Keep it.

38:10.163 --> 38:13.749
I know
impulsively marrying

38:14.793 --> 38:17.461
a hot guy that you meet
in Las Vegas is pretty crazy,

38:20.215 --> 38:22.383
but, considering all that,
I think...

38:22.467 --> 38:24.385
I think we made it work.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.557
I don't regret it
for one second.

38:34.688 --> 38:36.563
And I'm not sure
if I'd be in one piece
right now

38:36.648 --> 38:37.898
if I didn't

38:39.275 --> 38:41.193
come home with you
from Vegas.

38:45.198 --> 38:46.573
I know I wouldn't be.

38:48.576 --> 38:51.662
Then I'd say we had
the most successful
marriage in history.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.255
I love you, Kelly.

39:05.885 --> 39:08.637
It feels so weird to say that
when we're saying goodbye.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.057
Maybe.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.603
I love you, too.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.370
Okay.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.757
Hey, thanks for
staying late.

40:26.841 --> 40:28.175
Yeah, no problem.

40:29.385 --> 40:30.761
It's a weird day anyway.
Uh...

40:30.845 --> 40:32.471
Not really sure
I wanna go home yet.

40:32.555 --> 40:35.349
I don't blame you.
I'm gonna have a beer.
You want one?

40:36.101 --> 40:37.267
Sure.

40:37.769 --> 40:41.188
Oh, for the record,
I thought you handled
Lullo really well.

40:42.357 --> 40:43.607
I felt for the guy.

40:46.820 --> 40:48.028
How are you
handling things?

40:48.530 --> 40:50.656
I don't mean to pry.
It was just...

40:51.366 --> 40:53.617
Seeing you sitting
in that shower stall

40:53.701 --> 40:55.202
and knowing that
you were upset...

40:57.080 --> 41:00.040
It's hard, you know,
not being able to
talk to each other.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.291
Like we used to.

41:06.339 --> 41:08.382
Things between
me and Casey are...

41:09.384 --> 41:10.509
It's tough.

41:10.593 --> 41:12.344
It's... It's tougher than
I thought it would be.

41:13.054 --> 41:15.389
Yeah, it's a lot of pressure,
working together.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.682
I don't know
how you guys do it.

41:16.766 --> 41:19.017
That's the thing.
It's not the work part
that's tough.

41:21.563 --> 41:23.438
It's... It's the...

41:23.523 --> 41:24.898
It's the home part.

41:28.111 --> 41:30.237
I honestly don't really know
what to do.

41:43.168 --> 41:44.418
Hey, Matt.

41:52.135 --> 41:53.177
Matt? Matt!

41:53.261 --> 41:54.303
Hey...

41:54.387 --> 41:55.429
Matt!
