WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.298
Can everyone see that?

00:09.843 --> 00:11.886
Okay, so what you don't wanna do here

00:11.970 --> 00:14.806
is you do not wanna cut
the underlying organs,

00:15.265 --> 00:19.394
so you are going to lift
the umbilical cord as you cut.

00:19.978 --> 00:23.314
So now that you have the skin flaps there,
you're gonna wanna pin them down

00:23.398 --> 00:25.108
with your dissecting pins,

00:25.942 --> 00:27.986
which I'm clearly out of at the moment.

00:28.570 --> 00:31.114
Okay, pin those flaps. I'll be right back.

00:56.097 --> 00:58.058
- No! Ew.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.026
- Sam.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.987
-Sam!

01:12.989 --> 01:13.823
Sam.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.034
Come on...

01:21.247 --> 01:22.332
Have a seat.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.505
"Jingle Bells," huh?

01:29.089 --> 01:31.007
Um... Well,

01:31.966 --> 01:35.136
Principal Westmore wants three weeks
of after-school detention.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.096
Three weeks?

01:36.179 --> 01:38.640
Your last incident
wasn't even a week ago, Sam.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.141
You're...

01:40.642 --> 01:42.018
lucky it's not worse.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.231
People were laughing
and I guess I got carried away.

01:46.314 --> 01:47.398
I'm sorry, Mr. Locke.

01:47.732 --> 01:50.860
Bud, you're not the first person
to seek the approval of others.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.403
It happens.

01:52.487 --> 01:55.907
But lately, it feels like
you're getting carried away a lot.

01:57.283 --> 01:58.535
What's going on?

02:00.870 --> 02:01.871
I don't know.

02:03.331 --> 02:04.582
How are things at home?

02:04.999 --> 02:08.211
Not the best,
but I dunno. It's okay.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.171
Look...

02:13.508 --> 02:17.137
Sam...

02:17.387 --> 02:18.721
I have been in your shoes.

02:19.013 --> 02:20.056
I screwed up a lot

02:20.140 --> 02:21.015
in the past.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.520
I know what it's like,
and I wanna help you.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.231
You do?

02:29.357 --> 02:30.233
Yeah.

02:31.609 --> 02:34.696
You mentioned trying for vocational school
after graduation.

02:35.029 --> 02:35.989
I did a little digging.

02:36.656 --> 02:37.699
<i>Sam!</i>

02:39.159 --> 02:40.827
And I found a few programs at...

02:42.370 --> 02:44.831
- <i>Sam!</i>
<i>-</i>

02:53.006 --> 02:55.592
<i>I see you, Sam.</i>

02:56.426 --> 02:57.510
How's that sound?

03:04.684 --> 03:05.643
What's that place?

03:07.061 --> 03:07.979
Uh...

03:09.063 --> 03:11.566
That's my family's home in Massachusetts.

03:17.363 --> 03:18.364
It's cool.

03:18.573 --> 03:19.908
You grew up in that house?

03:19.991 --> 03:22.869
It's been in the family
for a very long time.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.829
This etching...

03:26.706 --> 03:28.458
it reminds me where I came from.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.879
Helps me appreciate where I am.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.222
Sally.

05:06.764 --> 05:08.349
I totally forgot about this.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.560
I'm worried about what the Well Lady said.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.103
I think we should call Tyler.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.731
I lost my phone down in the caves.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.607
The sea caves?

05:16.816 --> 05:18.985
Yeah, me and some friends
were trying to shoot some stuff

05:19.068 --> 05:19.944
for our film.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.546
Kinsey?

07:43.629 --> 07:44.755
Tyler?

08:10.364 --> 08:12.658
All right,
I think this is the last of my stuff.

08:12.825 --> 08:16.078
We should get Mom's phone
to check on Tyler and see if he's safe.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.247
Okay. If you're that worried.

08:27.965 --> 08:28.925
Shit.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.470
Why would Well Lady break a window?

08:32.929 --> 08:35.348
She can come and go
from any door in the house.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.355
Maybe it's not Well Lady.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.023
Then who is it?

08:57.161 --> 08:58.037
Tyler?

09:01.624 --> 09:03.501
-Hey there, Mrs. Locke.

09:04.794 --> 09:07.129
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't scream.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.258
- Please don't hurt us.
- Shut your mouth.

09:10.758 --> 09:11.926
I want you to go hide.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.177
What are you gonna do?

09:13.261 --> 09:14.595
I can't just leave Mom.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.557
I've got a better idea.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.769
Just don't freak out
when you see my body, okay?

09:21.852 --> 09:22.979
What happens to your body?

09:23.062 --> 09:25.022
I don't know. It just kinda looks weird.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.274
Like what?

09:26.357 --> 09:28.442
Like a sock without a foot in it.

09:28.859 --> 09:30.361
Or like I'm dead.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.197
Just guard my body, okay?

09:33.281 --> 09:35.116
And keep the door open.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.380
Bode?

09:50.381 --> 09:51.799
Holy crap!

10:07.231 --> 10:08.065
Okay...

10:16.657 --> 10:17.617
Mom?

10:19.702 --> 10:20.536
Mom?

10:21.370 --> 10:22.371
Mom?

10:22.997 --> 10:24.999
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.335
- Where are they?

10:28.169 --> 10:29.503
-How did you get out?

10:30.087 --> 10:31.505
-I escaped.
- Hey!

10:31.589 --> 10:33.257
There was a small fire.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.551
-Then a friend helped me get here.
- Mom!

10:37.470 --> 10:38.638
Why did you come here?

10:39.221 --> 10:40.222
To get the Head Key.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.183
I'm sorry?

10:42.266 --> 10:43.184
The Head Key?

10:43.267 --> 10:45.353
One of the special keys.
Don't act like you don't know.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.606
Does this have something to do
with Rendell?

10:48.689 --> 10:49.523
Don't lie to me!

10:49.607 --> 10:51.359
I'm not lying about anything.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.402
I want to help you.

10:53.569 --> 10:55.738
I just don't know
what you're talking about.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.948
The kids will know. Where are they?

10:58.824 --> 11:02.203
Sam. Please, Sam.
They won't know anything about anything--

11:02.286 --> 11:03.329
Shut up.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.664
- Let's go.
-Mom!

11:05.164 --> 11:06.332
I'm gonna go get help.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.419
Are you okay?

11:11.045 --> 11:12.713
-It's Sam Lesser.
-What?

11:12.797 --> 11:15.758
He's got Mom... and a gun,
and he says he wants the Head Key.

11:15.841 --> 11:19.387
-How does he know about the Head Key?
-I don't know, but he's here.

11:34.402 --> 11:35.403
What are you doing?

11:35.486 --> 11:36.445
Improvising.

11:38.447 --> 11:39.407
Let's go.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.578
Hey, Kinsey. Hey, Bode.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.291
Let her go.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.876
Yeah, totally. I can do that.

11:51.293 --> 11:52.461
We can all be friends.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.797
Just give me the Head Key.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.550
What's that?

11:59.051 --> 12:01.137
Do you know how angry it makes me
to be disrespected?

12:01.220 --> 12:03.597
I know you know what I'm talking about.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.559
So tell me where the goddamn key is

12:06.642 --> 12:08.477
or I'm making it two for two
for dead parents.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.812
Okay!

12:10.354 --> 12:11.188
Just stop!

12:15.025 --> 12:16.235
What a bright boy.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.696
Bode, don't!

12:18.779 --> 12:19.613
It's okay!

12:21.532 --> 12:22.867
I have this key.

12:22.950 --> 12:23.868
What is that?

12:23.951 --> 12:24.869
Where did it come from?

12:24.952 --> 12:27.079
And it is in <i>my</i> possession.

12:27.913 --> 12:28.831
Therefore,

12:28.914 --> 12:30.207
you cannot take...

12:31.917 --> 12:33.085
it.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.840
This isn't how she said
it's supposed to look.

12:38.632 --> 12:39.842
What do you mean, she?

12:40.843 --> 12:42.678
Did Well Lady send you?

12:43.262 --> 12:44.221
Well Lady?

12:44.305 --> 12:46.098
What's he talking about?
You two, you know?

12:46.182 --> 12:47.975
Yeah, but it's hard to explain.

12:49.518 --> 12:50.936
You got what you want.

12:51.145 --> 12:51.979
The Head Key.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.481
Try it.

12:57.651 --> 12:58.652
I don't think so.

13:05.910 --> 13:06.911
What do you have?

13:21.675 --> 13:23.636
You can tell
I'm losing my patience, right?

13:24.428 --> 13:25.971
Where is the Head Key?

13:30.643 --> 13:31.644
Tyler has it.

13:34.980 --> 13:35.940
Well, then...

13:36.357 --> 13:38.067
I guess we're gonna have to wait
for Tyler.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.529
Who's hungry? 'Cause I am.

13:42.738 --> 13:45.115
What did you say
this game is called?

13:45.199 --> 13:47.159
-You drink, I drink.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.203
- Mm...

13:51.372 --> 13:52.623
It's just so complicated.

13:52.706 --> 13:55.167
Can you walk me through it again?

13:59.213 --> 14:01.632
<i>♪ You know your body is a temple ♪</i>

14:28.367 --> 14:30.369
Why are you wearing Tyler's clothes?

14:35.749 --> 14:37.001
Someone has to explain to me

14:37.084 --> 14:38.460
-what's going on.
-No, they don't.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.798
Turkey tetrazzini time for all of you.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.717
It's pretty good.

14:47.052 --> 14:47.887
I just...

14:47.970 --> 14:50.180
wanna try and help you, Sam.
That's all.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.142
-Help you get what you need.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.189
Just spoons. No sharp forks.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.028
I'm a vegetarian.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.571
Then eat around the meat.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.240
In the meantime,

15:09.783 --> 15:11.911
I think we all ought to have
a proper catch-up...

15:16.373 --> 15:18.292
Nobody? Okay, me first.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.837
Prison sucks, you guys.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.297
I think that's kinda the point.

15:24.548 --> 15:25.466
That's true.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.009
Probably is the point.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.136
But I broke out.

15:29.219 --> 15:30.512
Yeah, we can see that.

15:30.971 --> 15:31.972
How about you guys?

15:35.100 --> 15:36.352
Come on, how's Matheson?

15:36.435 --> 15:37.978
-How's the brain swelling?
-Kinsey!

15:38.062 --> 15:38.979
What?

15:39.980 --> 15:41.607
He said he wanted to catch up.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.485
I'm just curious
how the swelling in his brain is.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.987
You know,
from when you fractured his skull

15:47.071 --> 15:48.072
with a hammer.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.783
-Shame she didn't finish.

15:53.911 --> 15:54.954
Enough.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.667
Eat your dinner.

16:11.929 --> 16:12.805
One for you,

16:12.888 --> 16:13.722
one for me.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.064
What the shit is this about?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.780
I don't remember you asking permission.

16:29.863 --> 16:30.906
We were hungry.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.745
And my goddamn cola?

16:36.829 --> 16:38.330
-She was thirsty.

16:39.164 --> 16:42.126
-What, is there no water in the sink?

16:42.334 --> 16:43.419
What I thought.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.133
- Hey!

16:50.217 --> 16:51.093
"Hey," what?

16:51.176 --> 16:52.428
Just leave her alone.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.056
Hit me.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.392
-No.
-Hit me, you little wimp!

17:02.396 --> 17:03.856
What did I teach you?

17:04.273 --> 17:06.275
Expect a right hand punch to be thrown,

17:06.358 --> 17:07.735
throw your left up to block it,

17:07.818 --> 17:09.153
and throw a right of your own.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.618
-Where do you think you're going?
-It's my friend.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.662
- Who?
-My friend.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.585
-Hey.

17:24.668 --> 17:25.502
Hey.

17:26.462 --> 17:27.504
Hey, how you doing?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.923
I'm Randy, Sam's dad. And you are?

17:30.007 --> 17:31.717
I'm Tyler. Tyler Locke.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.802
-Oh, nice to meet you, Tyler.
-Nice to meet you.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.054
You're early.

17:35.512 --> 17:37.598
Yeah, got out of practice
sooner than I thought.

17:37.681 --> 17:39.058
Oh, practice. What practice?

17:39.141 --> 17:40.809
Tyler's on the hockey team. Let's go.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.357
See you around, Tyler.

17:47.733 --> 17:48.984
Yeah, see ya.

17:51.445 --> 17:52.780
You fellas have fun.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.207
That's an interesting tattoo, Sam.

18:03.707 --> 18:04.792
The Omega symbol.

18:05.584 --> 18:06.752
Came out well, I think.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.630
I noticed it the last time we saw you.

18:10.047 --> 18:13.008
-You wanna talk about Mr. Locke?

18:14.676 --> 18:16.386
I was asking about your tattoo.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.972
Because you want to know
what it has to do with Mr. Locke.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.641
-You think I'm stupid?
-I do.

18:20.724 --> 18:21.725
Well, I'm not.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.854
So, let's do it.
Let's talk about Mr. Locke.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.773
What would you guys say to Rendell Locke

18:28.273 --> 18:29.858
if he were here right now?

18:30.442 --> 18:32.820
I'd tell him he should've had
your looney tunes ass committed

18:32.903 --> 18:34.780
before you destroyed our family.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.283
What would you tell him, Sam?

18:40.077 --> 18:43.455
The man who tried his best to help you
before you shot him?

18:45.874 --> 18:46.875
I'd tell him...

18:48.585 --> 18:52.089
that this is all his fault
and it always has been.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.885
Why is it his fault, Sam?

18:59.471 --> 19:03.475
If you explain it to me,
I can help you get what you want.

19:06.353 --> 19:09.064
Who sent you to our house
back in Seattle, Sam?

19:12.526 --> 19:14.444
Dodge cares about me.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.155
She's the one who needs the keys.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.659
Well Lady's name is Dodge.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.041
You know who he's talking about?

19:28.917 --> 19:30.544
Why does she want the Head Key?

19:31.712 --> 19:34.381
Because the Head Key allows you
inside someone's head.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.093
And someone knows
how to open the black door.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.761
Who knows?

19:39.845 --> 19:41.221
It's none of your business.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.098
Did this Dodge person tell you
to kill Rendell?

19:43.765 --> 19:45.934
Remind me why
I have to answer any of your questions.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.687
I'm the one with the gun.

19:58.572 --> 19:59.823
So what do we do now?

20:02.326 --> 20:03.994
What do you mean?

20:04.620 --> 20:07.497
I mean the night's young
and I'm not done with you yet.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.546
I really, um...
I really should be getting home.

20:14.630 --> 20:18.342
I know this really good bar
just outside of town, huh?

20:19.009 --> 20:20.761
I really should go. Some other time,

20:20.844 --> 20:22.304
-maybe.
-Okay.

20:28.810 --> 20:30.187
Okay, why don't we just

20:30.270 --> 20:31.605
drive by the lighthouse then?

20:34.024 --> 20:35.442
Maybe go for Round Two.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.196
Oh, thanks.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.536
Can you give that back, please?

20:49.164 --> 20:49.998
What?

20:51.625 --> 20:52.501
This key?

20:53.377 --> 20:54.586
Give it back.

20:55.128 --> 20:56.004
Now.

21:05.013 --> 21:06.848
Why don't you just take it from me?

21:21.530 --> 21:22.698
Key House!

21:52.144 --> 21:53.520
What do you have for dessert?

21:55.230 --> 21:57.232
Hope you're not one
of those sugar-free mothers.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.901
- There's popsicles and ice cream

21:59.985 --> 22:00.819
in the freezer.

22:01.028 --> 22:01.903
In prison,

22:01.987 --> 22:03.280
I had this caramel custard thing.

22:03.697 --> 22:04.906
That was really good.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.284
-Get him, Ty!

22:12.497 --> 22:14.291
- Tyler! Tyler, be careful!

22:33.810 --> 22:35.020
- No!

22:37.731 --> 22:38.982
Quite the greeting, Ty.

22:39.816 --> 22:41.068
But I'm glad you're here.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.027
I need the Head Key.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.029
What?

22:44.112 --> 22:45.655
The Head Key! Now!

22:45.739 --> 22:47.199
-I've been waiting!
-I don't have it!

22:47.282 --> 22:48.116
Bullshit!

22:50.452 --> 22:51.286
Sam!

22:51.370 --> 22:53.413
You have three chances
to give me the right answer.

22:53.497 --> 22:56.541
- Sam!
-Tell him, Kinsey. Now!

22:56.875 --> 22:57.959
Tyler doesn't have it!

22:59.628 --> 23:00.670
Of course you lied.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.464
-Where is it?

23:02.547 --> 23:03.465
I buried it.

23:04.007 --> 23:04.925
Out in the woods.

23:05.425 --> 23:06.927
Why would you bury it in the woods?

23:07.010 --> 23:08.345
Because it's dangerous!

23:08.678 --> 23:10.472
And we knew somebody might want it.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.394
Why should I believe
a word you're saying right now?

23:18.105 --> 23:20.941
Because I don't want you to hurt
anybody else in my family.

23:22.984 --> 23:24.611
-Well, then...

23:25.654 --> 23:27.739
you, me and Bode
are gonna go dig it up.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.171
-Sam? Sam. I'll go with you.
- You're not going anywhere.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.257
-Take me instead.
-Shut up!

23:46.007 --> 23:47.467
I don't need either of you.

23:49.219 --> 23:51.763
- Bode doesn't need to come.
- Sure he does.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.099
He's my collateral.

23:55.559 --> 23:56.810
Right, little buddy?

23:57.769 --> 23:58.770
Sam,

23:58.937 --> 24:00.147
if you harm my children,

24:00.272 --> 24:02.023
you will wish I only had a hammer.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.109
-Do you understand me?

24:06.570 --> 24:07.904
Such a spitfire.

24:09.739 --> 24:11.908
That's exactly why I'm taking them
and not you.

24:12.534 --> 24:13.368
Let's go.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.251
If something happens to me,

24:22.210 --> 24:24.045
remember to take care of Sally.

24:26.965 --> 24:27.883
Sam!

24:28.091 --> 24:29.092
Please!

24:36.141 --> 24:36.975
So,

24:37.058 --> 24:39.352
what happens when Dodge
or whatever opens the black door?

24:39.436 --> 24:41.480
-Shut up and walk.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.065
I bet you don't even know
why you're doing this,

24:44.149 --> 24:46.193
-do you?
-I said be quiet!

24:47.527 --> 24:48.528
You can't trust her.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.155
All she does is lie to make you do stuff

24:50.238 --> 24:51.406
you shouldn't do.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.783
She lied to me and now she's lying to you.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.995
-Spoken as the son of a liar.

24:57.871 --> 24:58.955
So...

24:59.498 --> 25:02.542
-how have the past few weeks gone?
- Good.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.419
Really good actually.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.547
I don't know if Tyler told you,
but him and I have been hanging out some.

25:09.466 --> 25:12.552
Well, that is, uh...

25:13.053 --> 25:14.429
that is good to hear, Sam.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.765
-And class is going okay?
-Yeah.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.475
How are things on the home front?

25:19.726 --> 25:21.770
-Hold that thought.

25:22.395 --> 25:23.230
Hey.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.441
Oh, uh...
Yeah, hold on a sec.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.318
Yeah, tell him I'll be right there.

25:28.401 --> 25:29.361
Okay, thanks.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.488
-I'll be right back. Hang tight.

25:45.252 --> 25:46.169
Sam?

25:48.380 --> 25:49.381
Sam?

25:56.972 --> 25:59.140
-You don't have to be afraid.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.060
What are you?

26:02.352 --> 26:03.603
I'm your friend.

26:04.354 --> 26:05.397
I...

26:06.064 --> 26:07.440
Or at least I want to be.

26:09.776 --> 26:11.570
Look on the desk, Sam.

26:13.863 --> 26:14.906
Just look.

26:24.916 --> 26:25.959
Open it.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.733
They're not your real friends, Sam.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.401
They lie to you.

26:51.651 --> 26:54.237
-You're nothing more than a virus to them.

26:55.655 --> 26:56.615
But me...

26:57.824 --> 26:59.659
I would never lie to you, Sam.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.370
'Cause I know how special you are.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.413
Stop!

27:05.582 --> 27:06.708
This isn't real!

27:06.791 --> 27:08.209
Yes, it is, Sam.

27:08.918 --> 27:11.004
And I know how to get you what you want.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.674
You just have to listen to me, okay?

27:15.467 --> 27:16.551
Just listen.

27:21.139 --> 27:22.098
Whoa...

27:24.184 --> 27:25.685
Sam?  Sam!

27:28.188 --> 27:29.189
This is the spot.

27:30.523 --> 27:31.358
Sit.

27:35.278 --> 27:37.030
-Dig.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.085
Oh, it's no use.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.801
- Screw this.
-What are you...

27:59.803 --> 28:02.222
-Jesus, Tyler. Are you okay?

28:02.305 --> 28:04.683
Yeah, I'm all right.

28:11.815 --> 28:12.941
-You have your phone?
-Yeah.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.110
-Where were Bode and Kinsey

28:15.193 --> 28:16.861
-before Sam got here?
-Winter Study.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.908
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

28:29.666 --> 28:31.668
You do know
that if there's no Head Key down there,

28:31.751 --> 28:33.128
I'm gonna have to kill both of you.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.630
-It's down here, I promise.
-Then hurry up!

28:49.811 --> 28:50.770
Really?

28:50.854 --> 28:51.813
That was your plan?

28:56.568 --> 28:58.737
I have no choice now.
You realize that, right?

29:14.169 --> 29:15.128
What?

29:21.843 --> 29:22.969
Holy shit!

29:29.893 --> 29:31.519
-Let's go!

29:44.157 --> 29:46.534
-What did the cops say?
-Five to ten minutes.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.661
-Maybe we should go out there.

29:49.621 --> 29:50.705
What are you doing?

29:55.752 --> 29:56.669
What is that?

30:08.598 --> 30:10.099
-Oh, my God!

30:13.019 --> 30:14.062
Mom! Mom, wait!

30:18.149 --> 30:19.359
Get out of my way!

30:19.442 --> 30:20.693
-He shot them!

30:30.912 --> 30:31.788
Shit!

30:35.041 --> 30:36.000
Tyler?

30:48.304 --> 30:49.138
Enough of this.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.279
You made me do this!

31:05.154 --> 31:07.156
I can't let her down! I can't!

31:16.040 --> 31:17.000
What the hell is that?

31:17.083 --> 31:19.127
-Holy shit!
-What the hell is going on?

31:20.962 --> 31:22.672
Sam, Bode and Kinsey?

31:22.755 --> 31:24.132
They ran off. Into the woods.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.216
The gunshots.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.593
Some creature attacked me.

31:26.676 --> 31:27.886
Bode and Kinsey are okay?

31:27.969 --> 31:29.762
If that thing didn't get them. Is that me?

31:30.555 --> 31:31.764
And that's my front door.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.349
What the hell is happening?

31:33.433 --> 31:34.767
It's the Head Key.

31:34.851 --> 31:35.852
And this is real?

31:35.935 --> 31:37.520
You've seen it before, Mom.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.480
Not this, but magic.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.274
You just can't remember.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.818
Why can't I remember?

31:44.402 --> 31:46.070
Is this why you killed Rendell?

31:46.154 --> 31:47.655
Tyler, I screwed everything up.

31:49.532 --> 31:50.450
Oh, my God.

31:52.035 --> 31:53.494
Oh, shit.

31:55.663 --> 31:57.790
I didn't wanna kill Mr. Locke,

31:57.874 --> 31:58.708
I didn't.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.585
I just wanted to find the keys for her.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.421
Dodge?

32:06.841 --> 32:09.677
That thing I said to you
about my dad, that...

32:10.678 --> 32:12.055
had nothing to do with it?

32:12.138 --> 32:15.058
If you ever do decide to kill your dad,
do me a favor:

32:15.141 --> 32:16.267
kill mine while you're at it.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.856
What did you say to me?

32:25.652 --> 32:26.653
It doesn't matter.

32:30.573 --> 32:32.033
I thought you were my friend.

32:33.201 --> 32:34.535
But you lied to me.

32:35.536 --> 32:37.664
You and your dad, you both lied to me.

32:38.790 --> 32:42.460
Yeah, my dad pushed me
to hang out with you to...

32:43.169 --> 32:44.462
to try and help you!

32:45.964 --> 32:47.340
But I actually liked you

32:48.216 --> 32:49.384
and we were friends,

32:49.592 --> 32:51.010
until you showed up at my house

32:51.094 --> 32:51.928
with a gun!

32:55.056 --> 32:56.557
She told me I was special.

32:57.725 --> 32:58.977
That she cared about me.

33:00.478 --> 33:03.898
You think if she really cared about you,
she'd be making you do any of this?

33:06.317 --> 33:07.402
You don't understand.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.739
No. I think I do.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.836
What's on the other side of that door?

33:27.046 --> 33:28.798
It's inside Sam's head.

33:28.881 --> 33:30.633
What do you mean his head?

33:30.717 --> 33:31.759
Mom.

33:31.926 --> 33:33.011
Mom. Mom! Stop!

34:02.832 --> 34:05.126
- Thank you, Sam. You found it.
- Sam!

34:05.793 --> 34:07.628
-She can't take it from you.
- Shut up!

34:07.712 --> 34:09.005
Not unless you give it willingly.

34:09.088 --> 34:11.758
All of this could've been avoided
if your idiot father

34:11.841 --> 34:13.551
had just told Sam what I needed to know.

34:24.187 --> 34:25.188
What are you doing?

34:26.606 --> 34:28.232
Do you really think I'm special?

34:28.816 --> 34:30.318
Of course I think you're special, Sam.

34:33.279 --> 34:34.989
Promise me you're not lying.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.866
-Mom.

34:37.241 --> 34:38.159
Mom, are you okay?

34:39.535 --> 34:41.245
Do you think I would lie to you?

34:45.333 --> 34:46.334
Sam.

34:47.794 --> 34:48.878
Sam!

34:50.880 --> 34:53.800
Just tell me you're not lying.
Just tell me!

35:06.395 --> 35:08.397
Maybe I can't take keys from the Lockes...

35:12.276 --> 35:14.028
but anyone else is fair game.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.321
Let's go.

35:15.863 --> 35:16.864
Let's go!

35:17.615 --> 35:19.158
Come on!

35:25.665 --> 35:27.583
Why did you?

35:29.418 --> 35:30.586
Why?

35:35.758 --> 35:37.969
There's a reason
why no one loved you, Sam...

35:41.764 --> 35:44.767
it's because there's nothing special
about you at all.

35:45.351 --> 35:49.063

35:49.147 --> 35:50.398
