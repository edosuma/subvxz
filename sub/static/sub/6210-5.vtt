WEBVTT

00:01.933 --> 00:03.635
I love going to the movies
in the Other Realm.

00:03.636 --> 00:06.037
You see next year's blockbusters
before they're even made.

00:06.038 --> 00:07.338
Mm.
Those poor mortal actors.

00:07.339 --> 00:09.541
They actually think
they have free will.

00:11.544 --> 00:12.577
Ow!

00:12.578 --> 00:14.212
What is going on?

00:18.117 --> 00:19.751
This is what it feels like
to be a mime.

00:22.888 --> 00:24.588
That's odd.

00:24.589 --> 00:28.126
The closet's never
refused entry to anyone before.

00:28.127 --> 00:30.295
Well, we'll have to figure it
out after the movie.

00:30.296 --> 00:32.095
What? You're just gonna
leave me here?

00:32.097 --> 00:33.498
Sorry, Aunt Hilda.
We're late.

00:33.499 --> 00:35.534
At least we won't have to sit
through the whole movie

00:35.535 --> 00:37.802
listening to you say,
"Now, which one is he?"

00:37.803 --> 00:38.603
But--

00:40.173 --> 00:43.040
Oh. This is so unfair.

00:43.041 --> 00:45.276
So looks like it's
just you and me.

00:45.277 --> 00:47.378
Wanna do each other's hair?

00:49.348 --> 00:50.849
Take that as a "no."

00:55.354 --> 00:57.288
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

01:10.102 --> 01:12.069
I think my dinosaur
is double-parked.

01:17.109 --> 01:18.677
Oh, Salem,
you must be up early

01:18.678 --> 01:19.978
for your paper route.

01:19.979 --> 01:21.179
Can I zap you
something to eat?

01:21.180 --> 01:22.446
Good idea.

01:22.447 --> 01:23.781
You know,
I've always felt breakfast

01:23.782 --> 01:25.750
is the most important meal
of the morning.

01:25.751 --> 01:27.219
You know what we never have
in this house?

01:27.220 --> 01:28.319
Possum.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.888
No. Pancakes.

01:31.757 --> 01:33.591
Pancakes for breakfast?

01:33.592 --> 01:34.793
You're mad!

01:35.795 --> 01:36.895
Pancakes?!
( gasps )

01:36.896 --> 01:37.862
No!

01:39.131 --> 01:41.500
You know, the whole
fork-up-to-my-mouth thing

01:41.501 --> 01:42.933
implied I was gonna
eat those.

01:42.934 --> 01:44.268
No pancakes.
Not in this house.

01:44.269 --> 01:45.570
Not ever.

01:45.571 --> 01:47.004
What are we,
fanatic waffle people?

01:47.005 --> 01:48.874
ZELDA:
You mustn't ever eat pancakes.

01:48.875 --> 01:51.142
No one in our family
can eat them.

01:51.143 --> 01:52.477
It's a family secret.

01:52.478 --> 01:53.577
<i>The</i> family secret?

01:53.578 --> 01:54.746
Just <i>a</i> family secret.

01:54.747 --> 01:56.314
But not being able
to eat pancakes

01:56.315 --> 01:58.549
is one of the darker
and more frightening secrets.

01:58.550 --> 02:01.152
Wow, makes the whole <i>Prince</i>
<i>of Tides</i> secret seem tame.

02:01.153 --> 02:04.022
All Spellmans have a terrible
weakness for pancakes.

02:04.023 --> 02:06.157
One bite and you won't
be able to stop.

02:06.158 --> 02:08.425
Mm, I can quit anytime
I want.

02:08.426 --> 02:10.794
Salem is not affected
because he's not family,

02:10.795 --> 02:12.730
but we're deadly serious
about you, Sabrina.

02:12.731 --> 02:16.200
Oh, no. Are we about to have
the parent-child pancake talk?

02:16.201 --> 02:18.903
We should have told you this
a long time ago.

02:18.904 --> 02:21.639
One bite of pancakes
and you'll be hooked for life.

02:21.640 --> 02:24.376
It's almost as shameful
as being hooked on phonics.

02:24.377 --> 02:25.577
Well, maybe
it won't affect me

02:25.578 --> 02:26.744
because I'm half-mortal.

02:26.745 --> 02:28.446
We can't take that risk.

02:28.447 --> 02:31.049
<i>Because our feelings</i>
<i>For Sabrina really matter</i>

02:31.050 --> 02:33.751
<i>Here's a spell to prevent</i>
<i>The aforementioned Sabrina</i>

02:33.752 --> 02:36.287
<i>From conjuring pancake batter</i>

02:36.288 --> 02:38.589
Well, what am I supposed
to do for breakfast?

02:38.590 --> 02:39.891
Try a poached egg.

02:39.892 --> 02:41.259
Yuck!

02:41.260 --> 02:42.427
This is ridiculous.

02:42.428 --> 02:44.496
Whoever heard of being
addicted to pancakes?

02:44.497 --> 02:45.530
Haven't you
learned by now

02:45.531 --> 02:46.964
to believe what
your aunts tell you,

02:46.965 --> 02:48.833
no matter
how silly it sounds?

02:48.834 --> 02:50.701
It's always
for your own good.

02:50.702 --> 02:52.002
But they look
so syrupy good.

02:52.003 --> 02:54.005
One teensy bite
can't possibly hurt.

02:54.006 --> 02:55.073
Sabrina, no.

02:55.074 --> 02:57.174
S-Sabrina!

02:57.175 --> 02:58.510
There. I ate pancakes,

02:58.511 --> 03:00.544
and I don't feel
one bit addicted.

03:00.545 --> 03:02.813
I knew my aunts
were overreacting.

03:02.814 --> 03:04.549
Just to save her from herself,

03:04.550 --> 03:08.285
I better destroy
the rest of these.

03:09.822 --> 03:10.654
Hey, what you eating?

03:10.655 --> 03:11.890
Pancakes.

03:11.891 --> 03:14.492
Really? Can I have some?

03:14.493 --> 03:16.394
Normally I would,

03:16.395 --> 03:17.862
but this may be
the only hot breakfast

03:17.863 --> 03:19.130
I get this week.

03:19.131 --> 03:21.499
My mom's not really
into cooking much

03:21.500 --> 03:22.801
since she got pregnant.

03:22.802 --> 03:24.769
She pretty much spends
her whole morning barfing

03:24.770 --> 03:26.170
and yelling at my dad.

03:26.171 --> 03:27.338
Come on.
Just one little bite.

03:27.339 --> 03:29.974
Since when did you become
such a pancake fiend?

03:29.975 --> 03:31.709
Ha! I'm not a fiend.

03:42.354 --> 03:43.454
Eww.

03:44.623 --> 03:46.057
They say she keeps
all her belongings

03:46.058 --> 03:47.258
in a shopping cart.

03:51.997 --> 03:53.130
My aunts did this to me.

03:53.131 --> 03:54.566
They put weird thoughts
in my head.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.801
I am not getting hooked
on pancakes.

03:56.802 --> 03:58.370
Hey! What's in that?

03:58.371 --> 04:00.204
French toast.

04:00.205 --> 04:01.639
Move along.

04:03.175 --> 04:05.543
I can't find anything wrong
with the linen closet--

04:05.544 --> 04:06.544
( sniffs )

04:06.545 --> 04:08.847
--except that musty,
grandmothery smell.

04:08.848 --> 04:10.482
But that came with the house.

04:10.483 --> 04:11.549
Well, then
why am I the only one

04:11.550 --> 04:13.817
it refuses to transport
to the Other Realm?

04:13.818 --> 04:16.420
You don't still have
that plate in your head, do you?

04:16.421 --> 04:19.790
You think it's that plate
in my head?

04:19.791 --> 04:21.759
Have you done or said
anything lately

04:21.760 --> 04:23.628
that might have angered
the Witches' Council?

04:23.629 --> 04:25.797
Of course not.
I've been an absolute peach.

04:25.798 --> 04:27.331
( siren wailing )

04:27.332 --> 04:29.767
Or perhaps
I've done something.

04:29.768 --> 04:31.536
Andrews.
Witch Immigration.

04:31.537 --> 04:32.771
Immigration?

04:32.772 --> 04:34.673
Well, you've obviously made
a gigantic mistake.

04:34.674 --> 04:36.908
My sister and I have lived here
for over 200 years.

04:36.909 --> 04:38.510
Oh, we had a report
that someone in this house

04:38.511 --> 04:40.678
has been living
in the mortal realm illegally

04:40.679 --> 04:43.448
without filling out
the proper paperwork.

04:43.449 --> 04:44.248
( laughs )

04:44.249 --> 04:45.817
Paperwork?

04:45.818 --> 04:48.352
Offer him a bribe.

04:48.353 --> 04:49.487
We're gonna have
to run a F.I.T.

04:49.488 --> 04:51.155
That's a field
immigration test.

04:51.156 --> 04:52.957
Read this sentence
aloud, please.

04:52.958 --> 04:54.459
Fine.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.495
"We went out and about
again and again

04:57.496 --> 04:59.430
in our Ford Falcon."

05:00.566 --> 05:01.966
You're next.

05:01.967 --> 05:03.301
I've got nothing
to hide.

05:04.869 --> 05:05.970
"We went oot and aboot

05:05.971 --> 05:07.671
agayn and agayn
in our Fared Felcon."

05:09.541 --> 05:10.641
Arrest her.

05:10.642 --> 05:12.043
What?

05:12.044 --> 05:14.145
Those results were completely
inconclusive, eh?

05:14.146 --> 05:16.180
Hilda, you never filled out
your paperwork

05:16.181 --> 05:17.415
to live in this realm?

05:17.416 --> 05:19.150
It was
200 years ago.

05:19.151 --> 05:20.285
I was busy chopping wood

05:20.286 --> 05:23.121
and trying to keep
Ben Franklin's hands off me.

05:23.789 --> 05:25.190
Where are you
taking her?

05:25.191 --> 05:27.459
Back to the northern sector
of the Other Realm,

05:27.460 --> 05:29.494
where she came from.

05:29.495 --> 05:30.795
Hilda?

05:30.796 --> 05:34.499
I'll FedEx you your cap
w-with the earflaps.

05:36.135 --> 05:37.869
Stop trying
to lick my hands.

05:37.870 --> 05:40.404
There's no syrup
on them.

05:40.405 --> 05:42.674
Okay. Today I'd like
to spend some time

05:42.675 --> 05:44.642
making a list of possible ways
to raise money

05:44.643 --> 05:46.143
for this year's prom.

05:46.144 --> 05:47.778
Anyone?

05:47.779 --> 05:49.380
Anyone at all?

05:51.883 --> 05:53.617
Last year I wrote, produced

05:53.618 --> 05:56.320
and modeled
in a fabulous fashion show.

05:56.321 --> 05:58.122
Didn't that lose $600?

05:58.123 --> 06:00.558
So?
I got to keep my wardrobe.

06:01.961 --> 06:03.861
We could raffle off a Cadillac.

06:03.862 --> 06:05.630
Do you know someone who has one?

06:05.631 --> 06:08.499
No. I'm just an idea man.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.701
I'm in the mood
for pancakes.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.101
Are you holding?

06:11.102 --> 06:13.004
Sabrina, you usually have
good ideas.

06:13.005 --> 06:15.339
What sort of a fundraiser
would you suggest?

06:15.340 --> 06:18.009
Pancakes!

06:18.010 --> 06:19.144
Are you suggesting

06:19.145 --> 06:21.779
we have a pancake breakfast
to raise money?

06:21.780 --> 06:23.581
No, no. I-I wouldn't want
to have breakfast

06:23.582 --> 06:25.549
with those soft, flaky,
fluffy,

06:25.550 --> 06:27.117
buttery,
melt-in-your mouth...

06:27.118 --> 06:28.552
Do you have any?!

06:28.553 --> 06:31.155
I think it's a charming idea.

06:31.156 --> 06:33.323
A pancake breakfast
it is. Heh.

06:33.324 --> 06:35.526
Sabrina, you're drooling.

06:37.129 --> 06:38.395
( phone rings )

06:38.396 --> 06:39.463
Hilda?

06:39.464 --> 06:41.298
Zelda, can you hear me?

06:41.299 --> 06:43.768
You've gotta get me
oot of here.

06:43.769 --> 06:45.803
( grunts )

06:45.804 --> 06:47.004
Are you all right?

06:47.005 --> 06:48.372
Is it just awful?

06:48.373 --> 06:51.008
Well, somebody just traded me
for some badger pelts.

06:51.009 --> 06:52.143
So in answer
to your question,

06:52.144 --> 06:53.644
yes, it is awful.

06:53.645 --> 06:54.745
( grunts )

06:56.615 --> 06:57.515
Do you mind?

06:59.285 --> 07:01.519
I'm trying to have
a conversation here.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.455
All right. Where were we?

07:03.456 --> 07:05.256
Oh, yeah. Help!

07:05.257 --> 07:07.358
Don't worry, Hilda.
I'll think of something.

07:08.494 --> 07:09.694
( men grunting )

07:09.695 --> 07:11.862
Okay, Frenchy, that's it.

07:11.863 --> 07:13.431
You're oot of here.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.367
There's gotta be something
in this house

07:16.368 --> 07:17.869
that tastes like pancakes.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.203
Oh! Maple-cured ham.

07:19.204 --> 07:21.005
Oh...

07:21.006 --> 07:24.108
Ugh! Stupid thing
just tastes like ham.

07:24.109 --> 07:25.109
Hello, Sabrina.

07:25.110 --> 07:26.410
Oh, uh, home from school.

07:26.411 --> 07:28.346
Felt like a snack.
Maybe fruit.

07:31.483 --> 07:32.983
Oh, I've got to fill out
all these forms

07:32.984 --> 07:35.452
or Aunt Hilda will be trapped
in the Other Realm forever,

07:35.453 --> 07:37.354
which I know has its upside,

07:37.355 --> 07:38.389
but she's my sister
after all.

07:38.390 --> 07:39.890
( giggling )

07:39.891 --> 07:42.059
Honey, are you all right?
Your hand is shaking.

07:42.060 --> 07:43.528
I don't think so.

07:43.529 --> 07:45.496
Maybe your eyes are shaking.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.768
( sighs )

07:50.769 --> 07:51.735
Okay.

07:51.736 --> 07:53.271
I know I can just sit here,

07:53.272 --> 07:56.173
watch TV and not think
about pancakes.

07:56.174 --> 07:58.443
MAN ( on TV ):
<i>Mannix, you've broken</i>
<i>every rule in the book.</i>

07:58.444 --> 08:02.680
<i>You can't eat pancakes</i>
<i>during a high-speed chase.</i>

08:02.681 --> 08:06.250
NARRATOR ( on TV ):
<i>Rommel's dilemma came down</i>
<i>to one agonizing choice:</i>

08:06.251 --> 08:09.386
<i>Hitler or pancakes.</i>

08:09.387 --> 08:11.155
HOST ( on TV ):
<i>Hello. You're on</i> Loveline.

08:11.156 --> 08:13.391
MALE CALLER:
<i>I like pancakes.</i>

08:13.392 --> 08:14.792
( screams )

08:14.793 --> 08:17.795
SALEM:
Jeez, I'm the only cat
I know who has insomnia.

08:17.796 --> 08:19.997
Maybe it's that 22-hour nap
I took today.

08:19.998 --> 08:21.933
Is that a light I see
in the kitchen?

08:25.203 --> 08:27.038
Sabrina!

08:27.039 --> 08:29.840
Oh! No! No!

08:29.841 --> 08:31.609
You're making pancakes,
aren't you?

08:31.610 --> 08:34.212
You're hooked!
You're a flapjack fiend!

08:34.212 --> 08:36.813
No, I'm not!
I-- I'm not!

08:36.815 --> 08:38.515
Yes, I am.

08:38.517 --> 08:40.583
I'm hooked.
And you know what?

08:40.585 --> 08:42.653
There's a big pancake breakfast
tomorrow at school

08:42.654 --> 08:44.488
and everyone's gonna know
my shameful secret.

08:44.489 --> 08:45.556
You've gotta help me.

08:45.557 --> 08:47.057
I'll help you
through this, Sabrina.

08:47.058 --> 08:49.860
There's no problem
you and I can't solve together.

08:49.861 --> 08:51.562
Except maybe world hunger.

08:51.563 --> 08:54.498
And war
and global warming and...

08:54.499 --> 08:56.934
Maybe we can't solve
this problem.

08:58.504 --> 09:00.838
Okay,
we can brew up a syrup

09:00.839 --> 09:03.107
that'll make you hate
the taste of pancakes.

09:03.108 --> 09:06.043
You can take it
with you to school

09:06.044 --> 09:10.047
and pour it on
before you take that first bite.

09:10.048 --> 09:11.482
It'll taste so bad--

09:11.483 --> 09:12.817
Quit flapping
your lip, cat,

09:12.818 --> 09:14.318
and give me
the first ingredient.

You're pressing
on my Adam's apple.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.356

Oyster juice.

09:24.363 --> 09:25.496
Great.

09:25.497 --> 09:28.098
Now, this time,
in the beaker.

09:30.301 --> 09:33.404
Oh, Sabrina,
you brought your own syrup.

09:33.405 --> 09:35.239
Yeah.
I-I'm germ-phobic.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.908
Me too.
I brought gloves.

09:38.643 --> 09:40.344
Hey, I saved you a seat,

09:40.345 --> 09:42.212
and I got you
an extra-big stack.

09:42.213 --> 09:44.448
Uh-huh, I'm just gonna
have a bite.

09:44.449 --> 09:46.216
Yesterday they were all
you could talk about.

Oh, so a woman

this one fell on the floor.

09:55.260 --> 09:56.860
I thought you might like it.

09:56.861 --> 09:58.696
Okay. What's the catch?

09:58.697 --> 10:00.398
Eww. Squared.

10:01.866 --> 10:04.335
Okay, I'm just gonna put
my syrup on these and then...

10:04.336 --> 10:05.837
My syrup.

10:05.838 --> 10:07.538
Where's my syrup?!

10:08.907 --> 10:11.108
No! Wait!

10:24.022 --> 10:25.255
They're delicious.

10:25.256 --> 10:26.523
They're blueberry.

10:26.524 --> 10:27.925
I don't like blueberry.

10:27.926 --> 10:28.892
Oh, no.

10:28.893 --> 10:31.229
More! I need more!

10:55.888 --> 10:58.722

of Hilda's immigration papers.

10:58.723 --> 11:02.059
"Emergency. Please rush."

11:02.060 --> 11:03.527
Now to get them
to the Other Realm.

11:04.629 --> 11:07.597
Why do you still use
the pony express?

He could have at least
cleaned up after his horse.

11:12.337 --> 11:14.539
There are wood shavings
everywhere.

11:14.540 --> 11:15.572
That was fast.

more than their elders.

to beat this thing.

for me. You'll be okay.

18:49.360 --> 18:52.829
Tonight's ladies' night,
and you'll be the only lady.

18:52.830 --> 18:56.400
ALL ( chanting ):
Eat, eat, eat, eat.

18:56.401 --> 19:00.904
Eat, eat, eat,
eat, eat, eat...

19:00.905 --> 19:02.606
HILDA:
<i>Sabrina?</i>

19:02.607 --> 19:04.008
Sabrina?

19:04.009 --> 19:06.643
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

19:06.644 --> 19:07.811
Sabrina.

19:08.947 --> 19:10.214
It's okay.

19:10.215 --> 19:11.348
It's Aunt Hilda.

19:11.349 --> 19:12.449
Is it over?

19:12.450 --> 19:14.251
There's only one way
to be sure.

19:14.252 --> 19:17.087
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

19:17.088 --> 19:18.087
No.

19:18.088 --> 19:19.689
Oh, very good.

19:19.690 --> 19:20.824
So how do you feel?

19:20.825 --> 19:22.492
Like I want pancakes.

19:22.493 --> 19:24.161
But I guess that's how
I'm always gonna feel.

19:24.162 --> 19:26.797
I'll just have to take it
one day at a time.

19:26.798 --> 19:28.765
I'm so proud of you.

19:28.766 --> 19:30.567
I should start getting
my life back together.

19:30.568 --> 19:31.769
I'm off to the mall.

19:31.770 --> 19:32.736
Not so fast.

19:32.737 --> 19:33.871
If Aunt Zelda were here

19:33.872 --> 19:35.639
she'd give you
some kind of parental lecture,

19:35.640 --> 19:38.174
but because she's still waiting
for me to save her,

19:38.175 --> 19:39.810
I'll have to fill in.

19:39.811 --> 19:42.513
Um, Sabrina, you--

19:42.514 --> 19:45.182
Should listen to you guys
and trust your advice.

19:45.183 --> 19:46.650
Right. And--

19:46.651 --> 19:48.285
Realize that it's easier
to solve problems

19:48.286 --> 19:49.620
when I ask for help.

19:49.621 --> 19:51.355
Exactly. And always--

19:51.356 --> 19:53.089
Know that my family
is there for me.

19:53.090 --> 19:55.358
Right. Man, I am good.

19:55.359 --> 19:56.694
( wind howling upstairs )

19:56.695 --> 19:58.562
ZELDA:
Sabrina! Hilda! Come quick!

19:58.563 --> 20:02.332
( grunting )

20:02.333 --> 20:04.935
I guess it's time to put chains
on this hamper.

20:04.936 --> 20:07.304
Aunt Zelda,
you escaped.

20:07.305 --> 20:09.139
How did you get oot?
I mean, out?

20:09.140 --> 20:10.640
I was sitting there,
waiting for you,

20:10.641 --> 20:13.043
in that awful saloon when...

20:13.044 --> 20:15.678
MAN ( on TV ):
<i>He's got a man open,</i>
<i>crosses the blue line.</i>

20:15.679 --> 20:17.414
<i>He's looking for a shot.</i>

20:17.415 --> 20:19.416
Oh, I don't know
how many of you

20:19.417 --> 20:21.485
are familiar
with <i>Swan Lake,</i> but--

20:22.553 --> 20:23.753
( men booing )

20:23.754 --> 20:24.855
And the next thing I know,

20:24.856 --> 20:27.023
I was being tossed
across the border.

20:27.024 --> 20:28.192
But, Sabrina, how are you?

20:28.193 --> 20:29.559
Oh, I'm fine.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.428
Aunt Hilda helped me
through it.

20:31.429 --> 20:33.630
Oh, well, I'm glad
Hilda helped someone.

20:33.631 --> 20:36.566
I'm just glad not to be
hallucinating anymore.

20:36.567 --> 20:39.603
Oh, hi, Mrs. M.

20:39.604 --> 20:40.737
Who is she talking to?

20:40.738 --> 20:42.639
I was--

20:42.640 --> 20:44.308
She was--

20:44.309 --> 20:45.542
Oh...

20:47.712 --> 20:49.012
Hard day.

20:49.013 --> 20:50.613
Lots of sugar.

20:54.986 --> 20:57.054
( slurring ):
You know what, Charlie?

20:57.055 --> 20:59.656
You're my only friend.

20:59.657 --> 21:01.024
( sobbing )

21:01.025 --> 21:04.695
You're my only friend
in the whole wide world.

21:04.696 --> 21:06.096
SABRINA:
Salem,

21:06.097 --> 21:08.398
how many catnip mai tais
have you had?

21:08.399 --> 21:09.299
What's it to ya?

21:09.300 --> 21:11.468
Salem, this has
gone too far.

21:11.469 --> 21:13.136
Your litter box
is a mess.

21:13.137 --> 21:14.605
You can't keep
your cat food down.

21:14.606 --> 21:17.007
You owe money to pet stores
all over town.

21:17.008 --> 21:19.209
You have to admit you've become
powerless over catnip.

21:19.210 --> 21:20.911
That your life has
become unmanageable.

21:20.912 --> 21:22.579
You know what,
Sabrina?

21:22.580 --> 21:26.049
You're my only f-friend

21:26.050 --> 21:28.385
in this whole
wide world.

21:28.386 --> 21:30.888
Let's get you home before
you start singing show tunes.

21:30.889 --> 21:33.657
SALEM:
My mother was a saint.

21:33.658 --> 21:36.526
I could take anyone
in this place.

21:36.527 --> 21:37.894
Come on!
