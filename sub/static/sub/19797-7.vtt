00:22.367 --> 00:24.000
DAVID: Stitch-up.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.767
It was a stitch-up.

00:26.634 --> 00:30.367
They filmed hours of material,

00:30.434 --> 00:35.100
and most of it is a good bloke doing a good job at work

00:35.167 --> 00:39.868
and the one time I accidentally head-butt an interviewee

00:39.934 --> 00:43.167
makes it to the programme, you're gonna look a prat.

00:43.234 --> 00:47.200
You're gonna... You head-butt a girl on telly, you're labelled a prat,

00:47.267 --> 00:49.133
and that's the game.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.334
And the BBC must have taken what, about eight hours footage a day,

00:52.400 --> 00:55.033
and I got it back and most of it was like, you know,

00:55.100 --> 00:57.367
"Oh, look. Here's a good guy, he's getting on".

00:57.434 --> 00:59.367
"He's their friend as well as their boss,

00:59.434 --> 01:03.601
"He's a motivator, an entertainer. There's lots of good stuff.

01:03.667 --> 01:05.434
"Oh, he's made one mistake,

01:05.500 --> 01:07.500
"like any human would, should we just cut that out?" "No, what?

01:07.567 --> 01:09.734
"Put that bit in, cut the other stuff out.

01:09.801 --> 01:11.634
"We want a scapegoat, we want to dumb down.

01:11.701 --> 01:16.000
"We wanna give them the biggest plonker of the year".

01:17.701 --> 01:19.000
You know...

01:22.234 --> 01:23.834
I'm not a plonker.

02:15.367 --> 02:16.701
You remember I'm going early tonight, eh?

02:16.767 --> 02:17.834
GARETH: Hmm?

02:17.901 --> 02:19.901
I'm going early.

02:19.968 --> 02:23.934
-I said that was all right? -Yes, you did, Gareth, yeah.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.300
Yep, there it is.

02:25.367 --> 02:26.701
Good. I'm so pleased.

02:26.767 --> 02:29.868
Gareth, are these the keys to your office?

02:29.934 --> 02:31.367
(GARETH SHOUTS)

02:33.634 --> 02:35.234

02:35.300 --> 02:37.567
He's locked me in again. Oliver!

02:42.801 --> 02:44.868
Hello?

02:44.934 --> 02:46.767
GARETH: Unlock it now. It's not funny. What if there was a fire?

02:46.834 --> 02:48.934
Sorry, who is this?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.400
Who do you think it is? Father Christmas? Open the door.

02:50.467 --> 02:52.500
I don't believe in you.

-Mel, if Gareth rings... -(PHONE RINGS)

02:54.601 --> 02:56.100

Hello?

02:57.734 --> 02:59.500
-MEL: Yeah. -(WHISPERING) Say no.

02:59.567 --> 03:03.100
What did he say? Listen. Can I just say though...

03:03.167 --> 03:05.467
Can I have those keys because he wants me to let him out?

03:05.534 --> 03:07.934
Yeah, I know, but I just locked him in and it's gonna be a bit of fun.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.234
But he's asked me and I just...

03:10.300 --> 03:11.500
-There's no problem. Okay. -I'll just open it.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.701
There's not really a problem.

WOMAN: You come in here a lot, do you?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.834
Big time. Need to stay healthy when you're on the road.

03:28.901 --> 03:31.033
Can't take chances.

03:31.100 --> 03:33.267
Although the only fruit I actually like is the bananas, isn't it, Paul?

03:33.334 --> 03:36.300
Yeah. And we all know what you do with them when you get them home, aye?

03:36.367 --> 03:39.834
Shove 'em up me... Gay! No, I'm not. He knows I'm not. He's just...

03:39.901 --> 03:42.667
Although, you know, Paul, fruit is very versatile, isn't it?

03:44.868 --> 03:46.234
You feeling cold, David?

03:46.300 --> 03:49.400
(CHUCKLES) Feeling cold. Mine's shrivelled!

03:49.467 --> 03:51.167
Look, he thinks we're mad!

03:51.234 --> 03:53.667
DAVID: (LAUGHS) You all right?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.033
Do I know you?

03:55.100 --> 03:57.234
Yeah. We're doing a follow-up.

03:57.300 --> 04:00.100
-To what? -To the documentary that went out on telly, just doing a...

04:00.167 --> 04:02.267
-What, you were in a documentary? -Yeah. Yeah.

04:02.334 --> 04:04.567
-What was it? -Come on.

04:04.634 --> 04:06.100
Are you that fat one from Airport?

04:06.167 --> 04:07.968
Obviously not.

04:08.033 --> 04:09.400
Wernham Hogg.

04:09.467 --> 04:11.267
-Wernham Hogg. Yeah. -What was it about?

04:11.334 --> 04:13.701
-About me. Following me around at work. -Not at the airport?

04:13.767 --> 04:15.901
-No. Forget the Airport. -No. I don't recognise you.

04:15.968 --> 04:19.634
You do recognise me. You're on the right lines. You just can't...

04:19.701 --> 04:20.834
Are you famous?

04:20.901 --> 04:22.067
(CHUCKLES) Penny's dropped!

04:22.133 --> 04:23.234
-Well, can I have your autograph? -Yeah.

04:23.300 --> 04:25.534
-You got a pen? -I've got a pen.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.033
-What's your name? -David.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.133
Oh! From one David to another!

04:30.200 --> 04:32.467
-Is your name David? -Oh, for...Yes!

04:35.734 --> 04:37.367
He knows who I am.

04:40.434 --> 04:42.400
WOMAN: Does that sort of a thing happen a lot?

04:42.467 --> 04:43.868
Getting recognised? Yeah.

04:43.934 --> 04:46.067
I mean, usually they know specifically who I am.

04:46.133 --> 04:48.968
He recognised me. He'll kick himself later.

04:49.033 --> 04:50.400
WOMAN: Is it ever a problem?

04:50.467 --> 04:52.968
Um, I mean, you always get the odd person

04:53.033 --> 04:57.367
who doesn't appreciate what you're doing, shouts silly things, but...

04:57.434 --> 04:59.834
WOMAN: What sort of things?

04:59.901 --> 05:02.267
"You beardy twat". "Pug-nose gimp".

05:03.067 --> 05:05.300
"Lard boy".

05:05.367 --> 05:08.868
And I go, "Yeah. What you have you ever done on telly? Nothing! So don't..."

Hello.

05:46.734 --> 05:48.367
Um...

05:48.434 --> 05:52.667
Right, I've got a meeting with Ray Howles,

05:52.734 --> 05:56.567
who's the building manager here at the Park Conference Centre.

05:56.634 --> 05:58.100
WOMAN: Are you a door-to-door salesman?

05:58.167 --> 05:59.434
No!

05:59.500 --> 06:02.367
I don't go cold calling,

06:02.434 --> 06:06.801
trying to sell people clothes pegs and dusters.

06:06.868 --> 06:11.601
I do sell dusters, but that's about 5% of what, you know, we do.

06:12.801 --> 06:16.701
Dustbins, floors, worktops, glass.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.167
Best till last, okay.

06:18.234 --> 06:20.934
Take one of these little fellas.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.868
I'm just gonna dip it in there, like that.

06:22.934 --> 06:24.868
Oh! It's nearly dry, okay.

06:24.934 --> 06:28.534
All I'm gonna do, just a circular motion like that on the wall.

06:28.601 --> 06:30.400
And because of the texture and quality of the chammy,

06:30.467 --> 06:32.901
that's coming off with tap water, okay.

06:32.968 --> 06:35.868
No solvents. Usually you run the risk of discolouring the paint.

06:35.934 --> 06:39.934
With this, I'm removing the stain job, not the paint job, okay.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.834
That's done. That's dry again. You can use that again.

06:43.901 --> 06:46.601
Fine. Seems fine. Can I take a dozen or so to start with?

06:46.667 --> 06:49.467
Sold to that man. Okay, yeah, sure.

06:49.534 --> 06:53.167
Start off like that and then let's see.

06:53.234 --> 06:56.033
Can I ask you something? Who does your tampons?

07:07.200 --> 07:08.500
Back again.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.267
A new Dawn.

07:14.334 --> 07:17.100
She looks a bit... A younger model, there.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.567
I'm not a model.

07:20.767 --> 07:22.567
Not as bright as Dawn.

07:22.634 --> 07:23.500
Hiya.

-Hey, David. -Hiya.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.834
See you later, man.

07:43.801 --> 07:45.267
-Huh? -(DOOR OPENS)

07:48.200 --> 07:49.801
Well, I bought that from Halfords.

07:49.868 --> 07:51.868
Oh! Here he is!

07:51.934 --> 07:54.300
(CHUCKLES) The fella who nicked me job!

07:54.367 --> 07:56.167
-Didn't nick it. -Nah. Didn't want it any more.

07:56.234 --> 07:59.100
-He begged for it back. -I didn't. Shut up! What are you talking about?

07:59.167 --> 08:01.934
He's here more often now that he doesn't work here than he was when he did work here.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.167
-Exaggerating! -Always nice to see you.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.334
Well, it's nice for them to see me, that's why I pop in so...

08:06.400 --> 08:08.567
-Bit disruptive. -Not disruptive.

08:08.634 --> 08:10.767
It's good for them, so it's good for the company, so it should be good for you.

08:10.834 --> 08:13.334
-Learn that! It's always nice for them to see me. -Always nice to see you.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.167
He's here an awful lot now, though.

08:15.234 --> 08:16.601
I am here an awful lot but I never outstay my welcome, so...

08:16.667 --> 08:17.834
Perhaps you should call ahead.

08:17.901 --> 08:19.334
I'm not gonna call ahead. You're not a doctor!

08:19.400 --> 08:22.000
When you're a doctor, I'll make an appointment.

08:22.067 --> 08:24.300
I'm hardly likely to be a doctor.

08:24.367 --> 08:28.667
I don't think you are. No. Six years medical training. He's got one O level.

08:28.734 --> 08:30.701
Always welcome, but maybe you should call ahead.

08:30.767 --> 08:32.534
Not gonna call ahead. No point.

08:32.601 --> 08:35.968
-Then I'll lock the door! -Yeah? I'll still get in! Let's see.

08:37.133 --> 08:38.367
-Oh! -Should...

08:38.434 --> 08:41.267
-Should phone ahead. -I'm not gonna call ahead.

08:43.601 --> 08:45.601
All right. I can only give you 10 minutes, David.

08:45.667 --> 08:48.000
-Ten minutes. What do you mean? -Uh, busy.

08:48.067 --> 08:50.033
I'm busy. I did 60 hours last week.

08:50.100 --> 08:53.400
I know how many hours you do a week. He seems to forget that!

08:56.534 --> 09:00.100
-You should phone ahead. -I'm not gonna call ahead.

09:00.167 --> 09:04.334
I did learn a lot from David. I learnt from his mistakes.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.500
Okay. We're very different people.

09:07.567 --> 09:10.868
He used humour where I use discipline.

09:10.934 --> 09:13.901
And I learnt that nobody respected him.

09:13.968 --> 09:15.934
And in a war situation,

09:16.000 --> 09:17.901
if you want your platoon to go over the top with you to certain death,

09:17.968 --> 09:22.968
it's no good saying to them, "Please come with me, lads. I'll tell you a joke".

09:23.033 --> 09:25.133
It's a direct order, "Come with me".

09:25.200 --> 09:28.901
And they'll go, "Yes, he's got good leadership skills,

09:28.968 --> 09:31.701
"let's all go with him to our certain death".

09:31.767 --> 09:34.868
And if... Also if you're laughing in the jungle,

09:34.934 --> 09:37.567
you're gonna give away your position to the enemy.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.100

Seems fine.

09:55.234 --> 09:57.133
Yeah? Fine. You're right.

'Cause it is 2002.

Oh, it's the wrong date. I'll change it.

No. Don't worry. I'll do it.

-Right. -And that big Keith, he's grotesque, isn't he?

10:15.934 --> 10:18.701
No, I didn't like it over there. I couldn't breathe.

10:18.767 --> 10:20.801
No, I mean, I had to get out. I couldn't stand it.

10:20.868 --> 10:24.801

10:45.133 --> 10:49.534

10:49.601 --> 10:51.701
This won't go out over here, will it?

10:51.767 --> 10:56.300
Okay, we're being naughty because you are sort of meant to go home after 90 days

10:56.367 --> 11:01.334

11:03.234 --> 11:05.467

Cost of living out here's so cheap. You can live on a pittance.

11:39.100 --> 11:42.834
In fact, our situation here is almost as good as it was in Slough, innit?

11:42.901 --> 11:46.067
Definitely. Definitely.

11:46.133 --> 11:48.434
-(RYAN WHIMPERS) -Oh! Oh!

11:48.500 --> 11:51.133
TIM: I had feelings for Dawn, obviously.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.234
And I realise now that...

11:55.367 --> 11:56.734
Well, we were really good friends,

11:56.801 --> 12:03.200
and I misinterpreted that friendship for something.

12:03.267 --> 12:05.701
And that wasn't how she was feeling,

12:05.767 --> 12:09.200
and it got a bit out of proportion in my mind, I guess.

12:10.634 --> 12:13.934
And I really wish I hadn't done what I did.

12:14.701 --> 12:16.000
But I did.

12:17.300 --> 12:20.834
But, you know, she's cool. Lee's fine.

12:21.834 --> 12:24.167
She said no to me so...

12:24.234 --> 12:26.934
And they're fine, you know. So, there's no harm done or anything, it's all cool.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.734
And from what I hear, they're loving it out there apparently.

12:31.934 --> 12:32.968
Hmm.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.534
It's a little bit different now, though,

12:37.601 --> 12:41.968
because Gareth is not General Manager as such like I was when I was here.

12:42.033 --> 12:43.567
I was sort of omnipotent.

12:43.634 --> 12:46.734
And he's doing a much more watered down version.

12:46.801 --> 12:48.868
That was just 'cause of your redundancy thing.

12:48.934 --> 12:52.200
They couldn't call the job the same thing. And he sued them.

12:52.267 --> 12:54.767
-WOMAN: Did you win? -Oh, yes.

12:54.834 --> 12:56.701
They had to paid you off, didn't they?

12:56.767 --> 12:58.868
Yeah. Out-of-court settlement. So, quite a lot of money. Ka-ching!

12:58.934 --> 13:00.934
-Wasted most of it, though. -I didn't waste it.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.968
Tell her what you spent it on.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.267
I released my own single, so if that's a waste of money...

13:06.334 --> 13:08.901
Well, it is a waste of money 'cause you didn't even get in the top 100.

13:08.968 --> 13:11.834
Good! Didn't want it to! Next.

13:11.901 --> 13:13.868
WOMAN: How much did that cost, putting out a single?

13:13.934 --> 13:17.200
"Costs" is a bit misleading because I was paying for everything.

13:17.267 --> 13:19.567
I paid for the studio time, PR costs all myself.

13:19.634 --> 13:21.033
Roughly, how much did you think you spent?

13:21.100 --> 13:22.868
Roughly, £42,000.

13:22.934 --> 13:24.601
(GARETH CHUCKLES)

13:24.667 --> 13:26.667
You know, that's all outgoings, though.

13:26.734 --> 13:32.033
That's not taking into account the money I made from the singles sold, so...

13:32.100 --> 13:33.834
WOMAN: How much did you make?

13:33.901 --> 13:37.200
Well, 'cause I had my own record label, Juxtaposition Records,

13:37.267 --> 13:38.934
I was taking the lion's share,

13:39.000 --> 13:42.200
so I was making a clear £1 profit for every single sold.

13:42.267 --> 13:43.901
How many records did you sell?

13:43.968 --> 13:47.567
(CLEARS THROAT) Fifty, something like that, over all.

13:47.634 --> 13:49.234
Sorry? 150.

13:49.300 --> 13:51.033
(CHUCKLES) It was mainly to friends and family.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.434
-No, it wasn't. -And people we knew.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.000
And they were only buying them out of sympathy.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.133
-Definitely not. -I bought five out of sympathy.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.200
No. You bought 'em for your mates.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.968
They're still in the garage.

14:01.033 --> 14:02.200
Why...

14:04.133 --> 14:08.767
# If you don't know me by now

14:10.334 --> 14:14.534
# You will never, never never know me

14:15.267 --> 14:18.000
# Ooh, ooh, ooh

14:20.167 --> 14:21.901
# All the things

14:24.033 --> 14:26.067
# That we've been through

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
# You should understand me

14:31.200 --> 14:33.701
# Like I understand you

14:35.400 --> 14:37.534
# Now, girl, I know the difference

14:39.100 --> 14:41.400
# Between right and wrong

14:42.767 --> 14:44.801
# Well, I ain't gonna do nothin'

14:46.400 --> 14:48.601
# To break up our happy home

14:50.100 --> 14:52.467
# Whoa, don't get so excited

14:54.200 --> 14:57.834
# I get home a little late at night

14:57.901 --> 15:01.601
# 'Cause we only act like children

15:01.667 --> 15:05.200
# When we argue, fuss and fight, whoa!

15:05.267 --> 15:09.234
# If you don't know me by now

15:09.300 --> 15:11.634
# If you don't know me!

15:11.701 --> 15:15.734
# You will never, never, never know me

15:16.734 --> 15:17.868
# Ooh, ooh, ooh

15:17.934 --> 15:20.434
# No, you won't, no

15:20.500 --> 15:24.200
# If you don't know me by now

15:24.267 --> 15:26.801
# If you don't know me!

15:26.868 --> 15:31.100
# You will never, never, never know me

15:31.801 --> 15:33.133
# Ooh, ooh, ooh

15:33.200 --> 15:34.634
# No, you won't #

15:42.167 --> 15:43.534
-Any calls, Melanie? -No.

15:43.601 --> 15:45.767
-No? Jeremy hasn't called? -No.

15:45.834 --> 15:48.534
You see all these white middle-class fuddy-duddies going,

15:48.601 --> 15:50.000
"Oh, we've got to find the new equivalent".

15:50.067 --> 15:51.767
They're looking Oxford and Cambridge. No.

15:51.834 --> 15:56.400
Dr Dre, yeah. Ice T. They're the equivalent of Wordsworth.

15:56.467 --> 15:58.767
-David. Yep. -Hiya. All right?

15:58.834 --> 16:00.667
-You doing all right? -Yeah. (SNIGGERS)

16:00.734 --> 16:03.467
I think I'm doing all right. Ask these. They know what I'm doing.

16:03.534 --> 16:06.000
I'm repping in the day. You know how bloody much I like that.

16:06.067 --> 16:09.234
And at night, I was just explaining to him, I do me celebrity appearances

16:09.300 --> 16:11.534
500 quid a time, so, yeah, I'm doing okay.

16:11.601 --> 16:14.634
-Is that enough jobs for you? -That's great.

16:14.701 --> 16:16.534
-How are you doing? All right? -Good, thanks, yeah.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.067
Good.

16:18.133 --> 16:19.934
Hope you're not keeping them from their work.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.100
No, I think a little morale boost helps them work, doesn't it?

16:22.167 --> 16:25.767
I think they're loving it. Look at their faces when I'm around, so...

16:25.834 --> 16:27.334
NEIL: Yes, I can see that.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.234
Just don't overexcite them.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.133
I'll try not to.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.734
-I'll see you later. -See you later.

16:34.801 --> 16:39.400
Oh, dear. "How's it going?" I think he bloody knows full well how well it's going.

16:39.467 --> 16:41.167
(GIGGLES) I'm lucky.

16:48.901 --> 16:50.567
WOMAN: Do you resent Neil?

16:50.634 --> 16:52.734
-The man or the boss? -Either.

16:52.801 --> 16:54.901
Neither. Next.

16:54.968 --> 16:58.067
Do you miss being in the office environment?

16:58.133 --> 17:00.334
Um, I am in the office environment.

17:01.601 --> 17:03.634
If you've got a mobile phone,

17:05.200 --> 17:06.968
you're in the office.

17:07.033 --> 17:09.534
I can be in my office, yeah?

17:09.601 --> 17:16.000
Bombing along at 70 miles an hour plus. 70 miles an hour tops. Yeah?

17:16.067 --> 17:17.868
And I can pull over safely.

17:17.934 --> 17:21.167
I can make a phone call, "Hi, Paula. It's David.

17:21.234 --> 17:25.167
"Can you fax me over those important facts and figures, please, ASAP?"

17:25.234 --> 17:27.767
You've got a fax machine in the car?

17:27.834 --> 17:31.367
Nah. Not in the car. But get to somewhere that has, call her again,

17:31.434 --> 17:34.334
go, "Hi. I'm here now. Can you fax it now?

17:34.400 --> 17:37.200
"I'm in the Ramada Inn, Reading. Look it up".

17:38.701 --> 17:40.634
That's... So...

17:48.067 --> 17:50.400
Okay, thank you for coming.

17:50.467 --> 17:55.467
Uh, 3:00 on the 14th. Fortnightly management meeting chaired by myself, G Keenan.

17:55.534 --> 17:56.868
All heads of division present. You've got your agendas.

17:56.934 --> 17:58.267
-TIM: Gareth? -What?

17:58.334 --> 17:59.968
Can I add just something to the agenda, please?

18:00.033 --> 18:02.734
No, you know full well you cannot submit something

18:02.801 --> 18:04.934
to be discussed during the meeting.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.267
BOTH: It has to be submitted before 2:00 so it can be typed up onto the agenda.

18:08.334 --> 18:09.601
This is the agenda. Has been typed up.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.834
Right. But I got this information after 2:00.

18:11.901 --> 18:14.167
There's no way I could have possibly got it in before.

18:14.234 --> 18:16.834
-Have to wait till next time. -Or how about I just tell you the information now?

18:16.901 --> 18:19.133
It won't go on the agenda.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.834
What if I just start telling you that Mike thinks the quotes he's given us

18:20.901 --> 18:23.000
-(SCATTING) -don't include VAT, so that...

18:23.067 --> 18:26.601
I did not officially hear that, all right? You know the rules.

18:26.667 --> 18:30.033
Right. Fine. Okay. So I cannot possibly get this on the agenda?

18:30.100 --> 18:32.434
-No. -There's no way I can get this on the agenda?

18:32.500 --> 18:35.667
-No. -So, what's point number seven on the agenda?

18:35.734 --> 18:37.467
-"Any Other Business". -Can I bring it up then?

18:37.534 --> 18:39.300
-Yes. -I'll wait till then.

18:39.367 --> 18:43.534
Right. Enough of this tomfoolery.

18:43.601 --> 18:45.434
Ooh.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.934
MAN: Were you embarrassed when Tim asked you out?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.434
-Which time? -Shut up.

18:50.500 --> 18:54.367
Um, I didn't... To be honest, I didn't know what to say, really, so...

18:54.434 --> 18:56.300
Well, you did, you said no.

18:56.367 --> 18:58.434
No, I mean, um...

18:58.500 --> 19:01.367
I was kind of mortified for Tim more than me.

19:01.434 --> 19:05.367
And anyway, for God's sake he's like a million miles away now.

19:05.434 --> 19:06.567
MAN: And you didn't feel...

19:06.634 --> 19:09.167
Okay, can we not not talk about it?

19:09.234 --> 19:13.167
I don't wanna hurt Tim's feelings.

19:13.234 --> 19:17.234
Well, look, everyone saw it, right, so I'm... I'm bang to rights.

19:17.300 --> 19:20.100
I told Dawn how I felt and she, you know...

19:21.601 --> 19:24.167
People are afraid, all right, to show their emotions

19:24.234 --> 19:27.367
because they don't want their mates to take the piss out of them, whatever.

19:27.434 --> 19:30.934
But luckily I have no mates. (CHUCKLES)

19:31.000 --> 19:34.100
So, um... Actually, when that bit went out on telly,

19:34.167 --> 19:38.834
I was watching it with my family and I was mortified obviously.

19:38.901 --> 19:40.968
And my grandmother said,

19:41.033 --> 19:43.167
"I'm not surprised she chose the other fella. I wouldn't kick him out of bed".

19:43.234 --> 19:46.133
(HUFFS) So, Lee,

19:46.200 --> 19:49.367
if you're watching and you ever get bored of being

19:49.434 --> 19:51.601
with someone with her own teeth,

19:51.667 --> 19:53.100
Nana's up for it!

19:53.167 --> 19:54.567
-Is he in? -(MEN LAUGHING)

19:54.634 --> 19:56.801
Oh! Hey!

19:56.868 --> 19:58.167
Never mind all that.

19:58.234 --> 20:00.234
Eh, the Brent master.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.701
How you doing, boy? Oh! (SIGHS)

20:02.767 --> 20:04.834
-All right, David? -Yeah. Not too bad. Not too bad.

20:04.901 --> 20:06.868
So how's life on the road?

20:06.934 --> 20:10.334
Pretty good, pretty good. Well, you should know, you know. Few perks.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.267
Really? What sort of perks?

20:13.334 --> 20:16.767
Use your imagination. Young, free and single. (SQUAWKS) Motels.

20:16.834 --> 20:19.100
-What, girls? -Well, don't be blatant about it.

20:19.167 --> 20:21.334
Is that not what you meant?

20:21.400 --> 20:24.701
Well, don't try and work out if I'm getting any or not. It's an innuendo, you know.

20:24.767 --> 20:26.567
So, you should know. You know what I mean?

20:26.634 --> 20:28.200
You don't, you're still behind a desk.

20:28.267 --> 20:31.000
-Well, I wouldn't if I could, now, anyway. -Why not?

20:31.067 --> 20:32.400
I'm getting married.

20:32.467 --> 20:35.100
Oh, yeah, congratulations.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.234
-Who to? -Her name's Rebecca.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.868
I've been going out about six years. Just doing the honourable thing now.

20:41.734 --> 20:44.634
-When's the wedding? -Not till next year.

20:44.701 --> 20:46.634
I'll be bloody married by then!

20:46.701 --> 20:48.767
-Who to? -Well, I'm saying a year's a long time!

20:48.834 --> 20:51.334
-You dating anyone at the moment? -Dating! Granddad!

20:51.400 --> 20:52.868
-FINCH: Of course he's not. -'Course I am!

20:52.934 --> 20:55.300
I'm out all the time. I'm not just tied to one woman...

20:55.367 --> 20:56.901
-Here's a picture of her. -Yeah. It's good.

20:56.968 --> 20:59.534
-Stunner, isn't she, eh? -"Stunner"? Sexist.

20:59.601 --> 21:01.267
Yeah.

21:01.334 --> 21:04.033
I prefer someone a little bit more intellectual, but...

21:04.100 --> 21:05.734
-Well, she's a doctor. -I see.

21:05.801 --> 21:07.467
You never seen a girl like that before, have you?

21:07.534 --> 21:09.601
Well, not without a staple through her stomach.

21:09.667 --> 21:10.968
(SQUELCHES)

21:14.133 --> 21:16.167
Degrading to a GP.

21:16.234 --> 21:17.701
So...Well done. Congratulations.

21:17.767 --> 21:19.901
Thank you.

21:19.968 --> 21:21.567
So, are you gonna be bringing one of your dates to the Christmas party?

21:21.634 --> 21:23.901
-Huh? -Bring one of your chicks to the party?

21:23.968 --> 21:25.033
-Yeah. -Yeah?

21:25.234 --> 21:26.868
So you'll need two tickets, then?

21:26.934 --> 21:30.601
Yeah. Put me down for two. Yeah, buy two, get one free.

21:30.667 --> 21:33.434
One for me, one for definitely a woman with me, yeah.

21:34.100 --> 21:35.534
-Yeah. -Great.

21:35.601 --> 21:37.734
See you there. With a lady.

21:39.300 --> 21:42.000
Yeah, I have girlfriends.

21:42.067 --> 21:44.067
On and off. They come and go.

21:45.133 --> 21:47.267
In, out, shake it all about.

21:47.334 --> 21:50.968
WOMAN: When was the last time you had an actual girlfriend?

21:51.033 --> 21:55.567
I don't look at it as when. I look at it as who and why, yeah.

21:55.634 --> 21:59.167
Because it's sort of like, a relationship's a heavy gig, so I've got to go...

21:59.234 --> 22:02.100
You know, if I'm going out with a girl... "Who? Why?"

22:02.167 --> 22:05.534
Yeah, I see it that if I'm having fun with a girlfriend

22:05.601 --> 22:08.000
or a girl, stroke, friend, whatever you wanna label 'em,

22:08.067 --> 22:11.334
it's got to be, "Oh, that was fun. Good.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.534
"Can we do it again tomorrow, David?"

22:12.601 --> 22:14.601
"Can't tomorrow. Doing something else".

22:14.667 --> 22:17.601
"What you doing?" "Back off. Yeah?"

22:17.667 --> 22:19.834
"Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies".

22:19.901 --> 22:21.901
So, you're not looking for a relationship?

22:21.968 --> 22:25.067
I'm not shopping for a relationship.

22:25.133 --> 22:28.734
Browsing. If I see a bargain, I've got the money.

22:28.801 --> 22:32.534
So, that's very much a... That's a metaphor. I'd never pay for it.

22:43.868 --> 22:45.734
Yeah. Mumbo Jumbo's.

22:45.801 --> 22:48.500
Oh! Smell the stale beer.

22:48.567 --> 22:50.701
Here we go. Mumbo Jumbo's.

22:50.767 --> 22:54.367
Oh! "Surprise TV Personality". (CHUCKLES)

22:54.434 --> 22:56.467
They haven't put it's me playing here,

22:56.534 --> 22:58.300
which is annoying, so my fan base won't know.

22:58.367 --> 23:00.033
I'm on. Oh! Here he is.

23:00.100 --> 23:03.801
I'd like to complain about this poster, please. (CHUCKLES)

23:03.868 --> 23:06.834
Peter, my agent. He runs the agency that's taken me on,

23:06.901 --> 23:09.500
doing all the PAs and stuff, it's nice.

23:09.567 --> 23:11.868
WOMAN: What sort of agency is it?

23:13.367 --> 23:15.033
A bit of everything really.

23:15.100 --> 23:17.868
Um...um...

23:17.934 --> 23:20.968
Tell her what sort of stuff you do. All the things...

23:21.033 --> 23:23.033
Well, we have celebrities.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.334
Like... Like David.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.033
-Uh, bands. -Tribute acts.

23:29.100 --> 23:32.367
-Tribute acts. Tribute bands. -Brilliant. Just like the real thing.

23:32.434 --> 23:35.868
-And lookie-likies. -Yeah.

23:35.934 --> 23:37.334
Got some good... Tell 'em what lookie-likies you've got.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.767
He's got all stars.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.133
-I got Kirk Douglas. -Michael Douglas.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.133
Michael Douglas. His son.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.601
-Yeah. looks like him. -Yeah. He does.

23:44.667 --> 23:46.734
He does. He looks just like him.

23:46.801 --> 23:48.100
WOMAN: What does he do?

23:48.901 --> 23:50.968
Uh, well, he... Yeah.

23:51.033 --> 23:52.667
He just turns up at a party.

23:52.734 --> 23:54.767
You hire him.

23:54.834 --> 23:59.934
Yeah, and he'll just wander around looking like Michael Douglas.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.734
Actually, I'm thinking of, um...

24:03.801 --> 24:06.267
At the moment, I'm thinking of getting a Catherine Zeta-Jones.

24:06.334 --> 24:08.801
-Good idea. -Really, 'cause, uh...

24:08.868 --> 24:10.901
'Cause a lot of people don't realise who he is.

24:10.968 --> 24:14.667
They just think he's some old bloke at the party.

24:14.734 --> 24:16.968
(SIGHS) Have you got any look-alikes of me

24:17.033 --> 24:18.968
so I don't have to turn up to these things? (CHUCKLES)

24:19.033 --> 24:20.767
No, you're nowhere near famous enough to have a look-alike.

24:20.834 --> 24:23.067
No, I'm joking.

24:23.133 --> 24:25.334
You're meant to big me up. Sort of.

24:27.667 --> 24:32.400
I have been given an opportunity that would literally be a sin to waste.

24:32.467 --> 24:34.434
So build on it. Yeah?

24:34.500 --> 24:36.234
They took a normal guy and they said,

24:36.300 --> 24:37.901
"Let's see what the nation thinks of him".

24:37.968 --> 24:41.901
And the nation seems to be saying, "Yeah. What else you got?"

24:41.968 --> 24:45.634
So, duty calls, you know.

24:45.701 --> 24:48.934
I seem to be able to give pleasure.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
It's two minutes to 1:00 a.m.!

24:51.067 --> 24:52.934
(CROWD CHEERING)

24:53.000 --> 24:54.367
That's right, folks. She's in the house.

24:54.434 --> 24:56.934
Sarah Whatmore is in the house!

24:57.000 --> 24:59.234
-(CHEERING) -(WHISTLING)

24:59.300 --> 25:02.000
One of the Popstars rejects, she's got a new single coming out soon,

25:02.067 --> 25:04.334
gonna perform that live in about 20 minutes.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.701
And let me tell you, lads, she is looking hot!

25:06.767 --> 25:08.801
-(CHEERING) -(MUSIC PLAYING)

25:10.567 --> 25:12.434
# Feeling hot, hot, hot

25:14.634 --> 25:16.567
# Feeling hot, hot, hot #

25:16.634 --> 25:18.534
All right, before that, we've got a special treat.

25:18.601 --> 25:22.200
You might recognise this guy from the BBC Two documentary, The Office.

25:22.267 --> 25:24.567
Some of you might even have bought his single recently,

25:24.634 --> 25:26.701
though probably not, 'cause it got to about number 400.

25:26.767 --> 25:30.667
But let's give him a big Mumbo Jumbo's welcome, it's David Brent!

25:30.734 --> 25:32.334
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

25:32.400 --> 25:35.200
-Good to see you. -Got to 113.

25:35.267 --> 25:38.067
Nice to see you. What you up to at the moment, David?

25:38.133 --> 25:40.200
Just doing this at the moment.

25:40.267 --> 25:42.133
No. Not just now. Generally. You've got loads going on, don't you?

25:42.200 --> 25:45.334
Yeah, yeah, yeah, doing more of these. Doing my walks for Mencap.

25:45.400 --> 25:47.100
Which is important to me.

25:47.167 --> 25:50.100
And also, you know, I've got lots of stuff in the pipeline.

25:50.167 --> 25:51.734
What sort of stuff in the pipeline?

25:51.801 --> 25:53.500
Oh! Even more of these.

25:53.567 --> 25:57.000
Um, opportunities, really.

25:57.067 --> 25:59.701
Great. Great, great. And what are you doing for us this evening?

25:59.767 --> 26:02.434
-Huh? -What you got planned?

26:02.500 --> 26:04.801
No, he just said come out, say hello.

26:04.868 --> 26:06.634
-That's it, is it? -Yeah.

26:06.701 --> 26:08.434
Let's give him a big hand. David Brent!

26:08.500 --> 26:10.467
# Feeling hot, hot, hot

26:12.400 --> 26:14.300
# Feeling hot, hot, hot

26:16.367 --> 26:18.500
# Feeling hot, hot, hot #

26:29.400 --> 26:31.334
Someone, who shall remain nameless,

26:31.400 --> 26:34.534
has persuaded yours truly to...

26:34.601 --> 26:36.033
It's a bit of a laugh really.

26:36.100 --> 26:37.868
Dating service. Online dating.

26:37.934 --> 26:40.567
I'm going along with it. But, you know...

26:40.634 --> 26:43.300
Try anything once. Variety is the spice of life.

26:43.367 --> 26:45.567
And all that. Living la vida loca.

26:46.667 --> 26:47.968
La dolce vita.

26:48.033 --> 26:50.167
Voulez-vous couchez avec moi?

26:50.234 --> 26:53.100
-Know what that means? "Will you go to bed with me?" -Yeah.

26:53.167 --> 26:54.400
I hope no French women apply now.

26:54.467 --> 26:55.901
Hope they do. I love French girls.

26:55.968 --> 26:57.300
Yeah. So do I. I'm joking.

26:57.367 --> 27:01.267
I'd do most nationalities.

27:01.334 --> 27:03.500
-Okay. Your personal details. -Liberal.

27:03.567 --> 27:08.267
Your physique. Would you say you are you slim, average, well-built, heavily built?

27:08.334 --> 27:10.067
-Should I put heavily built? -Well-built.

27:10.133 --> 27:12.367
Yeah?

27:12.434 --> 27:14.767
Yeah. Most of it's muscle, innit?

27:14.834 --> 27:16.367
-Yeah. Okay. -Innit?

27:19.701 --> 27:21.667
Has Neil got a

27:21.734 --> 27:23.100
date for the wedding or is he just...

27:23.167 --> 27:25.567
-This September? -September?

27:25.634 --> 27:28.067
Could be good. Might rain.

27:29.467 --> 27:31.968
Could be a wash-out. I hope not. I hope not.

27:32.033 --> 27:33.367
How would you describe your looks?

27:33.434 --> 27:36.901
Very attractive, attractive, average?

27:36.968 --> 27:40.534
You can't put very attractive. It looks like arrogance, don't it?

27:40.601 --> 27:42.167
Put attractive.

27:42.234 --> 27:43.734
She'll see me.

27:43.801 --> 27:45.467
Okay. Occupation...

27:45.534 --> 27:48.434
And it's just me and my little boy and, you know, sort of Andrew.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.434
That's it. That's it. That's all I care about.

27:50.500 --> 27:54.334
Nothing can get in the way. An mind you, I usually get in me own way.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.067
Did I tell you this?

27:56.133 --> 27:58.500
We went to that Euro Disney in, um...

27:59.601 --> 28:01.534
-In Paris. -In Paris.

28:01.601 --> 28:04.934
And there's a ride my son wanted to go on, the Space Mountain.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.133
And it's a 40-minute wait for the ride, to go on the ride.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.901
So, I said to my husband, um...

28:14.634 --> 28:16.734
Andrew.

28:16.801 --> 28:23.133
I said, "Andrew, there is no way I am waiting for 40 minutes to go on, um..."

28:23.200 --> 28:24.934
-Space Mountain. -"Space Mountain".

28:25.000 --> 28:28.434
"There is no way I'm queuing for 40 minutes to go on a ride".

28:28.500 --> 28:33.167
So I went up to the bloke who's supervising, you know, this French bloke.

28:33.234 --> 28:34.767
-Full of 'em. -And I said to him...

28:34.834 --> 28:36.267
He spoke perfect English.

28:36.334 --> 28:39.300
And I said to him... I said, "Listen".

28:39.367 --> 28:42.133
I said, "I'm with a young lad and he is sick".

28:44.200 --> 28:45.901
Didn't have to say anything else.

28:45.968 --> 28:47.934
He read between the lines.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.968
He thought he was terminally ill?

28:50.033 --> 28:53.834
I didn't say that, but we went right in the front of the queue.

28:53.901 --> 28:55.701
Brilliant. Well done.

28:55.767 --> 28:57.300
Good thing about that, of course, is there probably were

28:57.367 --> 28:59.467
sick kids in the queue and you went straight past them.

28:59.534 --> 29:03.167
Well, I don't know. There's no way I'm waiting for 40 minutes to go on a ride.

29:03.234 --> 29:04.667
Why should you? Why should you?

29:04.734 --> 29:05.901
Yeah. I'll tell you what, though.

29:06.801 --> 29:09.334
Your interests. Pubs?

29:09.400 --> 29:10.901
-Guilty! -Yes.

29:10.968 --> 29:12.667
-Sports. -Yeah.

29:12.734 --> 29:14.067
-What sports do you play? -(IN AMERICAN ACCENT) Squash.

29:14.133 --> 29:15.767
I played you squash, you're rubbish.

29:15.834 --> 29:18.434
Well, I'm not much of a player, am I? Just... Just put it.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.200
-Cooking. You like cooking. -Don't put that though.

29:20.267 --> 29:22.267
-Why? -Start off on the wrong foot. Under the thumb.

29:22.334 --> 29:23.534
Cooking all me life.

29:24.901 --> 29:26.033
-Watching TV. -Yeah.

29:26.100 --> 29:27.234
Put documentaries.

29:27.300 --> 29:29.234
-You can't specify. -Type it in.

29:29.300 --> 29:32.000
-Mixing with friends. -Yeah, loads, put loads.

29:32.067 --> 29:34.033
-Travelling. -Yeah.

29:34.100 --> 29:36.234
-When was the last time you went travelling? -I travel, boy, I travel.

29:36.300 --> 29:37.701
-Where have you been to? -Hull.

29:37.767 --> 29:39.367
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Hull is hardly travelling.

29:39.434 --> 29:41.300
Oh, innit? How did I get there then?

29:41.367 --> 29:44.934
Did it come to me? Oh, here comes Hull down the motorway in a car.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.467
So arrogant now.

29:46.534 --> 29:48.367
-I'm just speaking my mind these days. -Lippy.

29:48.434 --> 29:52.500
-I'm an executive now. -Yeah. Will you jump on my grave so quickly?

29:53.801 --> 29:55.601
Come on.

29:55.667 --> 29:57.734
(SLURPING)

30:00.868 --> 30:03.400
-(SIGHS) -(CLEARS THROAT)

30:03.467 --> 30:06.868
And you know, you get bored with each other

30:06.934 --> 30:08.968
-if you're not careful. -Sure.

30:09.033 --> 30:14.067
And so Andrew's mum bought us the Kama Sutra and a sort of massage pack.

30:14.133 --> 30:17.801
-Sort of. -And I think the one

30:17.868 --> 30:21.567
we conceived with is the one where, right,

30:21.634 --> 30:25.100
Andrew's laid out and I squat over him.

30:25.167 --> 30:29.234
I lower down and he enters me, and I put my full weight on it and...

30:29.300 --> 30:30.567
Do you know what I mean?

30:30.634 --> 30:32.868
We're like that.

30:32.934 --> 30:37.334
And he's right up inside me because of the weight, and I simply rock on him.

30:37.400 --> 30:40.567
Which enables deeper penetration, which stimulates him and me.

30:40.634 --> 30:45.100
And I can do a lot when I'm there. I can get really, really low, you know.

30:45.167 --> 30:48.300
And I've got the strength in my legs and I can feel the support.

30:48.367 --> 30:50.500
And he's hittin', you know. Hittin' it right there.

30:50.567 --> 30:53.234
And that's it, bingo! And we're away.

30:53.300 --> 30:55.200
-(RYAN CRYING) -(HUSHING)

31:04.234 --> 31:06.234
-(CRYING CONTINUES) -(HUSHING)

31:06.300 --> 31:07.901
Do us a favour. Shut it up, will you?

31:07.968 --> 31:09.901
How am I supposed to do that?

31:10.868 --> 31:12.267
(CRYING CONTINUES)

31:12.334 --> 31:14.300
MAN: Will you get a chance to get back to Slough yet

31:14.367 --> 31:15.968
to see your friends and your workmates?

31:16.033 --> 31:19.334
Uh, yeah. No. Definitely not.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.534
MAN: Why is that?

31:21.601 --> 31:26.701
Um, well, for a start, costs three months' wages to go over there on what we earn.

31:26.767 --> 31:29.767
MAN: What if we were able to arrange for you to go back?

31:29.968 --> 31:32.334
There's a million reasons we can't go, so...

31:32.400 --> 31:34.400
LEE: What do you mean, "Arrange it"?

31:34.467 --> 31:36.667
MAN: If we were able to take care of everything, would you want to go back?

31:36.734 --> 31:39.467
-Yeah, of course. -Let's talk about it first!

31:39.534 --> 31:41.500
Was that a genuine offer?

31:43.133 --> 31:44.734
GARETH: Right. "Her details".

31:44.801 --> 31:48.701
-"Her marital status. Single, divorced..." -Not divorced.

31:48.767 --> 31:52.500
No, husband might still be around. Might be a nutter. I'm not getting into all that.

31:52.567 --> 31:55.934
-Widowed? -I'd bloody love her to be widowed.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.300
(SOFTLY) Okay.

31:57.367 --> 32:00.667
-Minimum age required? -Twenty-five.

32:00.734 --> 32:02.801
I don't think you should go out with a 25-year-old.

32:02.868 --> 32:04.834
-Why not? -Age difference too much.

32:04.901 --> 32:07.467
-It's not too much. It's... -Well, 20 years is too much.

32:07.534 --> 32:11.267
Twenty years? Ten, if any... I'm not 45, Gareth!

32:11.334 --> 32:14.467
-No? -No... Are you blind?

32:14.534 --> 32:17.500
I thought 'cause of the... Jowls, you know...

32:17.567 --> 32:21.167
Jowls? Look at... Look at pokey-nose boy. Pinocchio man.

32:21.234 --> 32:25.367
Have that... Someone's eye out with that, you...

32:25.434 --> 32:27.801
-I'll send that, shall I? -What age did you put?

32:27.868 --> 32:30.667
-Uh... It's already sent. -What age did you put?

32:30.734 --> 32:33.367
-Forty-five. -I can't believe it! Forty-five?

32:35.200 --> 32:36.801
Well, think she's gonna be happy

32:36.868 --> 32:38.400
when she comes in and sees you looking like this?

32:38.467 --> 32:40.934
She's not gonna call if she's 25.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.734
I don't think you ever had a chance with a 25-year-old. (CHUCKLES)

32:49.000 --> 32:50.334
(PHONE RINGS)

32:53.334 --> 32:56.567
Okay, Christmas party ideas is what I'm looking for.

32:56.634 --> 32:59.500
-Um, shall we just blue-sky it? -Blue-sky it!

32:59.567 --> 33:02.200
Yeah, let's do that, Gareth. Yeah. Let's fly it up the flagpole

33:02.267 --> 33:04.067
and see if the cat sucks you off.

33:04.133 --> 33:08.400
Any ideas are welcome. Um... So, your party, what do you wanna see there?

33:08.467 --> 33:11.701
Brainstorm. Let's go.

33:11.767 --> 33:13.968
-Uh, buffet? -That sort of goes without saying.

33:14.033 --> 33:15.667
-Disco? -Okay, I like it.

33:17.100 --> 33:19.234
-Girls. -What do you mean?

33:20.467 --> 33:23.234
-Invite girls. -Girls will be coming.

33:23.300 --> 33:27.868
Not the girls that work here. Other girls. Pretty girls.

33:27.934 --> 33:29.968
Do you want some swing by prostitutes, Keith?

33:30.033 --> 33:31.534
It shouldn't cost you anything.

33:31.601 --> 33:32.934
(GARETH MUMBLES)

33:33.000 --> 33:35.868
-He's putting that down? -Um... Anything else?

33:35.934 --> 33:37.901
-WOMAN 1: Secret Santa? -S.S. I like it.

33:37.968 --> 33:39.767
-WOMAN 2: Dancing competition. -Dance comp.

33:39.834 --> 33:42.200
WOMAN 3: What about something for the old people?

33:42.267 --> 33:44.634
Something for the old people. Of course.

33:44.701 --> 33:48.868
Well... What are you putting there? You can't just... You can't put "something". What?

33:48.934 --> 33:51.067
Oh, I dunno. That's...

33:51.133 --> 33:53.234
Yeah. But we have to de... We can't just put "something for old people".

33:53.300 --> 33:54.968
You know, like what? Werther's Originals? A phone call from your son? What?

33:55.033 --> 33:57.100
-Anything else? -Wet T-shirt competition.

33:57.167 --> 33:59.234
Keith, we cannot have...

33:59.300 --> 34:01.133
He's writing that down as well! Is that something for the old people, Gareth?

34:01.200 --> 34:04.734
No, definitely not. That's a good point, actually. No OAPs in wet T-shirts.

34:04.801 --> 34:08.500
-So... The wet T-shirt competition's going ahead? -Look, it's a democracy.

34:08.567 --> 34:11.300
All right? That's the point. Everyone can get their ideas on a piece of paper.

34:11.367 --> 34:13.534
Gareth, Gareth... We cannot have a wet T-shirt competition.

34:13.601 --> 34:17.234
You can. Just need a bucket and T-shirt.

34:18.167 --> 34:20.234
Thank you.

34:20.300 --> 34:24.067
Um, there is gonna be a couple of blasts from the past at this Christmas party.

34:24.133 --> 34:25.934
Pete Gibbons and his wife Cheryl will be here.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.434
-WOMAN: Oh. -Gibbo.

34:27.500 --> 34:30.701
Nice to see them. Um... Jeff Lamp might be popping in.

34:30.767 --> 34:31.834
(SCOFFS) Oh, dear.

34:31.901 --> 34:33.834
Um, and also

34:33.901 --> 34:36.901
-Dawn Tinsley and Lee will be... -YOUNG WOMEN: Oh, are they?

34:36.968 --> 34:39.300
-...pop... Yeah. A flying visit. Um... -OLDER WOMAN: Is it? Great!

34:39.367 --> 34:41.601
GARETH: They'll be popping in. WOMAN 1: Yeah.

34:43.567 --> 34:46.467
Yeah, that was a bit of a shock, to be honest.

34:46.534 --> 34:48.300
Er...

34:48.367 --> 34:52.500
I suppose I'd thought, "Out of sight, out of mind" or whatever,

34:52.567 --> 34:55.367
and that I'd got her out of my system.

34:55.434 --> 34:59.467
But, yeah, when I heard she was coming back...

34:59.534 --> 35:03.834
Uh... I mean, what can I say? My stomach just sort of... (SQUELCHES)

35:03.901 --> 35:07.934
You know... (SMIRKS) At first, I thought it was embarrassment,

35:08.000 --> 35:13.901
and then it's the thought of seeing her, or whatever, you know.

35:13.968 --> 35:17.934
So there's... There's obviously something still there.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.534
Um...

35:19.601 --> 35:22.467
But I'm not gonna ask her again, obviously.

35:22.534 --> 35:26.701
You know. She'd have to ask me, you know.

35:26.767 --> 35:29.200
If she asked me...

35:29.267 --> 35:31.601
But that's... That's not gonna happen.

35:36.934 --> 35:39.901
I mean, we were torn about whether or not to go home for Christmas.

35:39.968 --> 35:43.267
Because, you know, it's gonna be 75 degrees in Florida.

35:43.334 --> 35:48.968
And then we found out that in Slough it's going to be drizzly!

35:49.033 --> 35:52.734
So you know... That swung it for us, didn't it?

35:52.801 --> 35:55.267
So, couldn't resist that! (SIGHS)

Give it up, yeah. It's Howard Brown!

37:02.167 --> 37:05.400

37:17.801 --> 37:22.234
DAVID: I'm not just chasing fame per se. People like to see famous people.

37:22.300 --> 37:25.467
And it annoys me when people have a go at celebrities.

37:25.534 --> 37:29.100
You know, like poor Noel Edmonds.

37:29.167 --> 37:32.868
People going, "Uh... Wha... What's he doing going round hospitals wards

37:32.934 --> 37:36.167
"at Christmas giving out presents to children?" You know?

37:36.234 --> 37:40.300
"Oh, he's doing it for himself, isn't he?" He's not doing it for himself!

37:40.367 --> 37:44.267
He's doing it for them. He's not doing it at all any more.

37:44.334 --> 37:46.133
He can't get on telly for love nor money.

37:46.200 --> 37:49.100
But when he was doing it, he was doing it for them, you know.

37:49.167 --> 37:53.801
What's up with... You go to... Uh, People like to see famous people.

37:53.868 --> 37:57.133

38:02.868 --> 38:06.467
They're gonna go, "What are you doing here?"

38:06.534 --> 38:08.200
And not in a racist way.

38:08.267 --> 38:11.734
They're happy to see him. He's welcome 'cause he's famous.

38:11.801 --> 38:13.534
Now it's time to meet our contestant.

38:13.601 --> 38:16.400
Remember she has no idea who our three lucky celebrities are.

38:16.467 --> 38:18.601
