00:03.150 --> 00:04.290
<b>Killua...</b>

00:05.830 --> 00:07.510
<b>I have you to thank.</b>

00:09.430 --> 00:11.970
<b>I've been like this since I woke up.</b>

00:13.130 --> 00:15.590
<b>Don't say that there's nothing you can do.</b>

00:21.120 --> 00:25.880
<b>If I can do anything to help Gon, I'll be happy to.</b>

00:27.730 --> 00:29.420
<b>But you must not forget...</b>

00:31.450 --> 00:35.850
<b>You are the one Gon needs most.</b>

02:03.970 --> 02:09.020
<b>Great Power x And x Ultimate Power</b>

02:11.750 --> 02:14.400
<b>Killua's voiced feelings toward Gon</b>

02:14.400 --> 02:17.870
<b>miraculously returned Palm to her old self.</b>

02:20.560 --> 02:22.990
<b>Meanwhile, on the west tower's second floor,</b>

02:23.450 --> 02:26.270
<b>Knuckle had ignored Meleoron's repeated warnings,</b>

02:26.750 --> 02:30.190
<b>appearing before those in the room</b>

02:30.190 --> 02:33.410
<b>in order to challenge Pouf.</b>

02:37.810 --> 02:38.860
<b>Pouf...</b>

02:51.190 --> 02:52.770
<b>Step outside.</b>

02:59.220 --> 03:00.380
<b>Very well.</b>

03:01.100 --> 03:02.500
<b>I will face you.</b>

03:03.480 --> 03:07.290
<b>But first, I have something to say.</b>

03:09.750 --> 03:12.540
<b>That which stands before you is only a clone.</b>

03:13.510 --> 03:17.050
<b>My true body is already on its way to the King.</b>

03:26.570 --> 03:30.890
<b>Having escaped the cage of smoke,</b>

03:31.240 --> 03:35.560
<b>Pouf had confirmed that Knuckle 
and Morel had made contact.</b>

03:35.960 --> 03:37.740
<b>He decided to assume</b>

03:37.740 --> 03:40.990
<b>that his enemies knew of 
his ability to create clones,</b>

03:40.990 --> 03:42.660
<b>and to act accordingly.</b>

03:42.910 --> 03:44.590
<b>That was the correct call.</b>

03:45.950 --> 03:48.780
<b>The boss told me that you could make clones.</b>

03:49.560 --> 03:50.660
<b>You're telling the truth.</b>

03:54.120 --> 03:58.250
<b>Knuckle said this aloud for Gon's sake.</b>

03:59.430 --> 04:04.180
<b>By telling the truth first, Pouf attempted 
to gain the mental advantage.</b>

04:05.580 --> 04:07.920
<b>His plan was a success.</b>

04:10.370 --> 04:13.290
<b>But why are you telling me this?</b>

04:14.840 --> 04:17.470
<b>Pouf's concern was Youpi.</b>

04:18.860 --> 04:20.690
<b>Since Knuckle was here,</b>

04:21.150 --> 04:24.390
<b>that meant that Youpi had spared his life</b>

04:24.390 --> 04:26.770
<b>and had not told Pouf this.</b>

04:29.980 --> 04:31.830
<b><i>Depending on his reason...</i></b>

04:35.880 --> 04:37.260
<b>Answer me!</b>

04:41.870 --> 04:44.050
<b>To satisfy him.</b>

04:50.870 --> 04:56.310
<b>Pouf needed to leave the room peacefully 
so that he could persuade Knuckle</b>

04:56.720 --> 05:00.160
<b>to tell him the motive behind the 
transformation he'd sensed in Youpi.</b>

05:01.620 --> 05:05.070
<b>I told you in order to satisfy him.</b>

05:06.100 --> 05:10.340
<b>He has demanded that I not leave this room.</b>

05:11.010 --> 05:13.050
<b>If we are to engage in a duel,</b>

05:13.050 --> 05:17.530
<b>I will need him to withdraw his 
demand, so that I may leave.</b>

05:19.840 --> 05:21.720
<b>I am but a clone...</b>

05:22.480 --> 05:24.200
<b>I cannot use my wing scales.</b>

05:25.030 --> 05:27.760
<b>However, I am still willing to fight you.</b>

05:29.430 --> 05:32.270
<b>What I seek is a discussion.</b>

05:32.710 --> 05:34.840
<b>That is why I revealed the truth.</b>

05:36.840 --> 05:42.360
<b>Pouf knew that when dealing with someone who 
would call him from behind to challenge him,</b>

05:43.190 --> 05:48.220
<b>appearing to be telling the truth 
would be more effective.</b>

05:52.880 --> 05:53.870
<b>You're lying...</b>

05:57.540 --> 06:01.380
<b>You were going to kill me from behind.</b>

06:05.480 --> 06:07.310
<b>You even admitted it.</b>

06:08.170 --> 06:10.390
<b>Knuckle, don't let him fool you!</b>

06:13.320 --> 06:16.950
<b>First, you claim to be a clone.</b>

06:17.820 --> 06:19.900
<b>Are you able to prove that?</b>

06:21.910 --> 06:22.900
<b><i>He's right.</i></b>

06:32.130 --> 06:34.910
<b><i>This boy is proving troublesome.</i></b>

06:37.070 --> 06:43.040
<b><i>I dare say that, of our enemies, 
he possesses the strongest will.</i></b>

06:46.320 --> 06:50.770
<b><i>Perhaps I should be pleased</i></b>

06:50.770 --> 06:53.930
<b><i>that he is trapped here with Pitou.</i></b>

06:54.970 --> 07:00.420
<b><i>Because his strong will keeps him in here.</i></b>

07:05.260 --> 07:11.070
<b>Were I to prove myself a clone, I would 
be placing myself at a disadvantage.</b>

07:11.360 --> 07:12.740
<b>So I can say nothing.</b>

07:14.030 --> 07:17.080
<b>You must use your own judgment.</b>

07:17.420 --> 07:18.680
<b>And...</b>

07:22.030 --> 07:24.280
<b>I shall allow you</b>

07:26.500 --> 07:28.960
<b>to decide what happens next.</b>

07:30.280 --> 07:32.720
<b>Pouf, you can't mean to...</b>

07:38.840 --> 07:39.980
<b>Stop...</b>

08:13.840 --> 08:16.510
<b>I'll wait in front of the entrance for ten minutes.</b>

08:16.510 --> 08:19.150
<b>Whether you come or not is your choice!</b>

08:24.100 --> 08:25.270
<b>Please wait...</b>

08:25.710 --> 08:27.290
<b>I'm still here!</b>

08:27.720 --> 08:29.390
<b>I apologize for Pouf's behavior!</b>

08:29.970 --> 08:31.610
<b>I'm the only one you need, right?</b>

08:37.890 --> 08:38.780
<b>Ten minutes.</b>

08:41.210 --> 08:45.290
<b>You have ten fewer minutes to heal her.</b>

08:51.970 --> 08:54.300
<b>Pitou was trembling.</b>

08:55.170 --> 08:57.970
<b>It was disturbing enough that</b>

08:57.970 --> 09:02.470
<b>Pouf had been willing to leave, 
despite the consequences.</b>

09:03.070 --> 09:07.230
<b>But what was truly frightening was 
how Gon ignored Pouf's taunts,</b>

09:07.230 --> 09:10.680
<b>calmly moving up the deadline instead.</b>

09:15.720 --> 09:16.840
<b><i>How long?</i></b>

09:17.530 --> 09:18.820
<b><i>How long do I have to wait?</i></b>

09:21.620 --> 09:23.830
<b><i>To completely heal her</i></b>

09:24.510 --> 09:26.580
<b><i>will take three to four hours.</i></b>

09:27.200 --> 09:28.830
<b><i>No, I can't wait that long.</i></b>

09:31.730 --> 09:33.840
<b><i>If I have an hour,</i></b>

09:34.870 --> 09:38.090
<b><i>I can heal her most critical injuries.</i></b>

09:39.500 --> 09:44.130
<b>Originally, to protect Komugi 
and heal her completely,</b>

09:44.130 --> 09:48.840
<b>Pitou had deliberately named a longer 
time frame than was necessary,</b>

09:48.840 --> 09:50.860
<b>which Gon had denied.</b>

09:51.190 --> 09:54.400
<b>So the hour that they'd agreed 
upon was the actual time</b>

09:54.400 --> 10:00.370
<b>Pitou believed necessary for Komugi 
to make a full recovery.</b>

10:01.840 --> 10:02.900
<b>However,</b>

10:03.590 --> 10:08.960
<b>Doctor Blythe had grown stronger over time.</b>

10:10.780 --> 10:12.260
<b>It may have been possible</b>

10:12.260 --> 10:14.990
<b>to speed up the treatment by ten minutes.</b>

10:15.390 --> 10:17.770
<b>Upon thinking this, Pitou realized...</b>

10:19.060 --> 10:20.750
<b>It may have been mere coincidence,</b>

10:21.270 --> 10:26.500
<b>but it was likely that Gon had only chosen ten 
minutes to conform with Pouf's parting words.</b>

10:28.090 --> 10:33.490
<b>Despite that likelihood, Pitou 
could not shake a bad feeling.</b>

10:35.590 --> 10:37.310
<b><i>I must risk my life.</i></b>

10:38.650 --> 10:40.660
<b><i>Or else his fangs</i></b>

10:43.980 --> 10:47.160
<b><i>may reach the King's throat!</i></b>

10:50.700 --> 10:51.790
<b>I understand.</b>

10:53.590 --> 10:54.470
<b>Knuckle.</b>

10:55.870 --> 10:58.360
<b>I'll be fine here alone.</b>

10:59.310 --> 11:01.050
<b>I said that Pouf was lying,</b>

11:01.390 --> 11:06.610
<b>but it's probably true that his main 
body is headed for the King.</b>

11:08.850 --> 11:11.060
<b>The King is to the south.</b>

11:19.040 --> 11:23.570
<b>Gon and Killua had seen everything 
that had transpired.</b>

11:24.850 --> 11:26.880
<b>But since Pitou did not know that,</b>

11:26.880 --> 11:30.870
<b>it was only natural to assume that Gon</b>

11:30.870 --> 11:33.580
<b>had seen through Pouf's plans.</b>

11:34.230 --> 11:38.780
<b>Pitou's worst fears had been confirmed.</b>

11:39.700 --> 11:44.300
<b>Pitou was now fully resolved to 
complete the mission at hand.</b>

11:55.370 --> 11:57.290
<b><i>I must kill him.</i></b>

11:58.500 --> 12:00.110
<b><i>No matter the cost!</i></b>

12:00.700 --> 12:01.890
<b><i>I must kill him...</i></b>

12:03.220 --> 12:04.670
<b><i>For the King's sake!</i></b>

12:06.750 --> 12:08.860
<b><i>Do I move as soon as Komugi is healed?</i></b>

12:09.300 --> 12:10.460
<b><i>No, that won't work.</i></b>

12:10.850 --> 12:12.750
<b><i>I can't expose her to danger.</i></b>

12:15.630 --> 12:19.060
<b><i>First, I must entrust her to someone else.</i></b>

12:19.920 --> 12:23.430
<b><i>Pouf and Youpi dislike Komugi.</i></b>

12:24.830 --> 12:26.110
<b><i>This won't do.</i></b>

12:26.630 --> 12:31.130
<b><i>If I'm gone, who will take Komugi to the King?</i></b>

12:33.510 --> 12:34.400
<b>Gon,</b>

12:34.990 --> 12:37.550
<b>I understand what you're saying.</b>

12:38.120 --> 12:39.290
<b>However...</b>

12:39.950 --> 12:42.110
<b>I will still do things my way.</b>

12:46.750 --> 12:47.620
<b>Youpi is...</b>

12:57.500 --> 12:59.960
<b>No, never mind.</b>

13:01.540 --> 13:05.970
<b>If Knuckle's information made Gon hesitant,</b>

13:06.640 --> 13:09.880
<b>it could result in his death.</b>

13:11.200 --> 13:12.340
<b>See ya.</b>

13:15.230 --> 13:18.830
<b>Knuckle managed to stop himself.</b>

13:34.290 --> 13:37.450
<b>How would you know my name?</b>

13:43.630 --> 13:48.050
<b>My subordinates were present at the 
moment of your mother's passing.</b>

13:50.710 --> 13:54.330
<b>She uttered your name with her dying breath.</b>

13:55.550 --> 14:00.540
<b>And my subordinates may have died 
fighting your Royal Guard by now.</b>

14:07.320 --> 14:09.680
<b>Interested in fighting me now?</b>

14:13.160 --> 14:16.850
<b>If you can force me to admit defeat,</b>

14:16.850 --> 14:19.290
<b>I will tell you your name.</b>

14:22.020 --> 14:26.480
<b>Force you to admit defeat without killing you?</b>

14:31.110 --> 14:33.910
<b>So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap...</b>

14:43.790 --> 14:45.070
<b>No matter.</b>

14:45.070 --> 14:47.280
<b>I shall checkmate you shortly.</b>

15:02.920 --> 15:04.920
<b>As the King moved into his stance,</b>

15:05.420 --> 15:07.030
<b>Netero took to the air.</b>

15:41.350 --> 15:42.960
<b><i>When was it...</i></b>

15:47.850 --> 15:51.480
<b><i>that I began to wait for my opponent to attack?</i></b>

15:54.360 --> 15:56.000
<b><i>Whenever you're ready,</i></b>

15:57.250 --> 15:58.220
<b><i>come at me.</i></b>

16:41.540 --> 16:43.270
<b><i>100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva...</i></b>

16:41.600 --> 16:45.770
<b>100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva</b>

16:58.450 --> 17:03.960
<b>Ninety-ninth Hand</b>

17:00.060 --> 17:02.160
<b><i>Ninety-ninth Hand!</i></b>

17:42.670 --> 17:45.440
<b><i>When was it</i></b>

17:50.340 --> 17:54.020
<b><i>that I stopped hesitating to be gracious,</i></b>

17:54.940 --> 17:57.510
<b><i>taking the hands of vanquished opponents</i></b>

17:58.750 --> 18:03.300
<b><i>when they bowed their heads in defeat?</i></b>

18:05.970 --> 18:07.970
<b><i>That cannot be</i></b>

18:08.710 --> 18:11.590
<b><i>the ultimate power I sought!</i></b>

18:26.580 --> 18:28.670
<b><i>It is fighting with all my soul against</i></b>

18:29.340 --> 18:31.980
<b><i>an opponent with the strength to defeat me!</i></b>

19:55.120 --> 19:57.010
<b>This is a tomb.</b>

20:01.820 --> 20:03.380
<b>Your tomb.</b>

21:31.840 --> 21:33.610
<b><i>I am very thankful.</i></b>

21:42.420 --> 21:44.460
<b><i>Thankful for everything</i></b>

21:45.390 --> 21:47.760
<b><i>that has made our meeting possible!</i></b>

23:24.770 --> 23:26.920
<b>Next time: Zero x And x Rose.</b>

23:27.210 --> 23:29.120
<b>We haven't seen each other in a while.</b>

23:29.120 --> 23:29.800
<b>Yeah.</b>

23:29.800 --> 23:31.830
<b>But it feels like you were always with me.</b>

23:31.830 --> 23:32.800
<b>Yeah.</b>

23:32.800 --> 23:34.630
<b>The future is ours.</b>
