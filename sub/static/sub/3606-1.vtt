00:06.073 --> 00:09.174
<i> My name is Kara Zor-El.</i>

00:09.176 --> 00:13.746
<i> 24 years ago my planet,</i>
<i> Krypton, was in serious peril.</i>

00:13.748 --> 00:19.985
<i> My cousin, Kal-El, was sent to</i>
<i> a planet called earth for his</i>
<i> own safety and protection.</i>

00:21.055 --> 00:23.122
<i> You may know his story.</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:35.567
<i> The story you don't</i>
<i> know is that I was</i>
<i> sent to protect him.</i>

00:41.342 --> 00:45.210
Your pod's coordinates are
interlocked with Kal-El's.
You will follow him to earth.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.713
I'm not afraid, father.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.482
The trip is long
but you'll sleep
most of the way

00:50.484 --> 00:52.251
and we'll be with you
in your dreams.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.854
You'll journey to earth
to look after your baby
cousin, Kal-El.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.456
Because of the earth's
yellow sun,

00:57.458 --> 00:59.691
you'll have great powers
on this planet.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.594
You will do
extraordinary things.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.030
I won't fail Kal-El or you.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.268
I love you, Kara.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.669
(Explosion)

01:10.671 --> 01:12.171
You must go, now.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.142
(Sobs)

01:22.083 --> 01:23.182
Go!

01:36.730 --> 01:40.466
Kara: <i> Things didn't exactly go</i>
<i> according to my mother's plan.</i>

01:46.140 --> 01:48.874
<i> Krypton's destruction</i>
<i> sent a shock wave</i>

01:48.876 --> 01:52.644
<i> that knocked my pod off course</i>
<i> and into the phantom zone.</i>

01:53.914 --> 01:57.182
<i> A region in space</i>
<i> where time doesn't pass.</i>

01:57.184 --> 02:02.221
<i> I slept there for 24 years</i>
<i> until somehow I got here.</i>

02:03.991 --> 02:07.192
<i> When I arrived, I was</i>
<i> still a 13-year-old girl.</i>

02:07.194 --> 02:10.262
<i> But in that same time</i>
<i> my cousin Kal-El</i>
<i> had grown up</i>

02:10.264 --> 02:14.600
<i> and revealed himself</i>
<i> to your world as superman.</i>

02:14.602 --> 02:18.337
<i> The most powerful man</i>
<i> in the universe.</i>

02:18.339 --> 02:22.908
<i> My cousin wanted me</i>
<i> to have the same safe</i>
<i> human-type childhood he did.</i>

02:22.910 --> 02:27.379
<i> So he placed me with my</i>
<i> adoptive family, the danvers.</i>

02:27.381 --> 02:32.251
<i> Scientists who once</i>
<i> helped him understand</i>
<i> his own super abilities.</i>

02:32.253 --> 02:36.755
I know I'm not
your mom, sweetheart.
But you're safe here.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.994
Kara:
<i> They had a daughter, Alex.</i>

02:41.996 --> 02:46.231
<i> And despite being born</i>
<i> on different planets,</i>
<i> we both shared one thing.</i>

02:46.233 --> 02:49.701
<i> We knew our lives would</i>
<i> never be the same again.</i>

02:49.703 --> 02:52.905
<i> My cousin,</i>
<i> he didn't need</i>
<i> my protection.</i>

02:54.208 --> 02:56.208
<i> I didn't have</i>
<i> a mission anymore.</i>

02:57.845 --> 03:00.979
<i> But even though I had all</i>
<i> the same powers he did...</i>

03:00.981 --> 03:02.915
-(Grunts)
-Sorry, sorry.

03:02.917 --> 03:05.984
Kara: <i> I decided the best</i>
<i> thing I could do is fit in.</i>

03:07.655 --> 03:09.054
<i> After all,</i>

03:09.056 --> 03:11.390
<i> earth didn't need</i>
<i> another hero.</i>

03:11.392 --> 03:14.393
I need two tickets in
the orchestra section
for <i> wicked.</i>

03:14.395 --> 03:17.696
No, not for miss Grant.
Her mother wants to see it.

03:17.698 --> 03:21.133
Yes, again. Sure, I'll hold.

03:21.135 --> 03:24.403
Charlie? I'm calling about
the correspondents dinner,

03:24.405 --> 03:28.740
I need to make sure
miss Grant doesn't end up
next to bill O'Reilly again.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.143
Kara: <i> I work at</i>
<i> catco worldwide media.</i>

03:31.145 --> 03:35.080
<i> An online and print empire</i>
<i> built by my boss, cat Grant.</i>

03:35.082 --> 03:38.150
<i> The most powerful woman</i>
<i> in national city.</i>

03:38.152 --> 03:41.153
<i> At least,</i>
<i> for the next few days.</i>

03:41.155 --> 03:44.289
Did you see this?
There was an armored car
robbery last night.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.458
There were no witnesses
except for this homeless guy

03:46.460 --> 03:49.161
-who swears
the perp had horns.
-Thanks.

03:49.163 --> 03:51.597
-Like, on his head!
-(Both chuckle)

03:51.599 --> 03:53.298
I'm telling you,
they're out there. Aliens!

03:53.300 --> 03:55.734
Winn, there's no
such thing as aliens.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.136
(Chuckles) Well, you
might feel differently if you
read this website.

03:58.138 --> 04:02.541
-You write that website.
-I contribute... (Stutters)

04:02.543 --> 04:06.178
Hey, um, I was wondering
if maybe you wanna...

04:06.180 --> 04:08.180
I don't know, go see,
go see a movie tonight.

04:08.182 --> 04:10.749
I... I can't. I'm sorry.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.751
(Inhales deeply)
I have a date.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.455
-Date, really?
-Mmm.

04:16.457 --> 04:21.293
That's great... fun.
Dating is fun.
Who is that with?

04:21.295 --> 04:23.929
It's an online date.

04:23.931 --> 04:27.266
Says we are
82% compatible, so...

04:27.268 --> 04:28.934
Should be good.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.737
You know that you can't
quantify emotions
based on an algorithm?

04:31.739 --> 04:34.940
Winn, you're it,
isn't your whole life
based on algorithms?

04:34.942 --> 04:38.877
Yes, so if there was
an algorithm for love I think
that I would know about it.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.146
It's just like you're gonna
know when it hits you, Kara.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.981
It'll be all "wah-pow".

04:45.953 --> 04:48.553
Cat: Ugh, this elevator is
a human petri-dish.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.522
It's like standing up
in coach.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.590
She's here.

04:51.592 --> 04:52.991
How do you do that?

04:54.628 --> 04:56.695
Good morning, miss Grant.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.631
The only reason I bought
this building was because
it had a private elevator.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.367
That way, I don't have
to get soaked in cheap
Cologne every morning,

05:02.369 --> 05:04.102
getting to my office.
Find out who used it,

05:04.104 --> 05:07.172
have them reprimanded,
or bathed, I don't care which.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.308
Here's your latte. Hot.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.676
(Cat sighs)

05:10.678 --> 05:13.211
That'll be new and different.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.980
I have a meeting with
the board today at lunch,

05:14.982 --> 05:17.015
so cancel
Sushi with my mother.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.284
Oh, and cancel my therapist.
I won't be needing it

05:19.286 --> 05:21.987
-if I'm not having lunch
with my mother.
-Got it.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.626
Also, I've emailed a list.

05:27.628 --> 05:31.263
Prepare termination
letters for the <i> tribune</i>
employees as noted.

05:31.265 --> 05:33.532
But it would be so nice
if you handwrote them.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.500
Use the lesser card stock.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.402
You're downsizing the <i> tribune?</i>

05:38.572 --> 05:40.405
But that was
your first acquisition.

05:40.407 --> 05:43.275
Go see if the new art director
has the layout ready.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.478
It's not that I don't see
your frown,

05:46.480 --> 05:49.181
it's just that I don't
care enough
to ask why it's there.

05:51.318 --> 05:54.486
All those people, they're
going to lose their jobs.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.987
(Inhales)

05:55.989 --> 05:59.091
What's going to happen
to them, to their families?

05:59.093 --> 06:01.426
They don't have to downsize
at the <i> daily planet.</i>

06:02.830 --> 06:06.031
Metropolis has a person
who wears a cape

06:06.033 --> 06:09.568
and flies around
performing heroic acts.

06:09.570 --> 06:15.507
The <i> planet</i> puts this
superlative man on their cover
54% of the time.

06:15.509 --> 06:19.878
You wanna save the <i> trib?</i>
Go find me a hero, kerah.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.048
(Softly) Kara.

06:25.452 --> 06:26.885
Hello?

06:29.022 --> 06:31.089
-Hello?
-James: I'll be just a minute.

06:31.091 --> 06:35.060
(Clears throat) Miss Grant
sent me for layouts and
she doesn't like to wait.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.928
Well, she can wait a minute.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.197
Have you met miss Grant?

06:39.199 --> 06:42.067
Yeah, what is she gonna do?
Fire me right after hiring me?

06:42.836 --> 06:44.236
Her loss.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.307
Hey.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.743
I'm the new guy.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.513
(Kara chuckles)

06:55.816 --> 06:57.482
(Clears throat)

06:57.484 --> 07:00.652
Oh, it's him.

07:00.654 --> 07:03.622
I've seen this picture, uh,
like a million times.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.557
It won the pulitzer.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.092
Wow.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.428
Yeah, only 'cause it was
the first real shot of him.

07:09.430 --> 07:12.330
Little secret,
he actually posed for that.

07:12.332 --> 07:13.965
I guess he likes me.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.969
Oh, my god,
you're Jimmy Olsen.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.938
The photographer
from the <i> daily planet.</i>

07:19.940 --> 07:21.740
James Olsen.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.075
Well, Jimmy is reserved for
my mom and the big guy.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.211
He's kind of
stuck in his ways.

07:26.213 --> 07:29.281
Um, I know
what I've read, but...

07:30.818 --> 07:32.884
What's he like in real life?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.287
He is

07:35.289 --> 07:38.557
everything you want
him to be and more. I mean...

07:38.559 --> 07:41.426
I was scared
to move out here,
but, uh, he told me

07:41.428 --> 07:43.762
the biggest risk is
never taking any, so...

07:43.764 --> 07:45.096
Hmm.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.267
-Take it.
-Hmm?

07:50.304 --> 07:51.303
Take it.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.638
This? No.
Oh, god, no, I can't.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.476
-I can't.
-It's just a print.
Please, take it.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.311
But first you have
to tell me who you are.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.316
-I never got your name.
-Oh.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.551
(Laughs) Gosh. Hi.

08:07.788 --> 08:10.655
(Stammers) Kara.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.157
Uh, Kara danvers.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.458
Kara.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.128
Anyone ever tell you
that you look

08:17.130 --> 08:18.597
a little like him right here?

08:21.568 --> 08:23.702
No.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.004
Uh, no. No, you're the first.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.976
-Uh, thank you. Very much.
-Yeah, of course.

08:31.512 --> 08:32.944
Um...

08:33.514 --> 08:35.046
Layouts.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.849
(Chuckling) Right.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.318
Almost forgot them. Bye.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.056
(Whispering) Wah-pow.

08:47.794 --> 08:50.295
(Knocking on door)

08:50.297 --> 08:53.098
I have a conference in
Geneva and I need to be
on a plane in 2 hours.

08:53.100 --> 08:56.968
And I have a blind date in
half an hour and I need you to
help me pick out what to wear.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.937
-I win.
-Why do you do this to me?

08:58.939 --> 09:01.606
Because I'm your sister
and you love me.

09:01.608 --> 09:04.743
I don't know, I feel like I'm
not living up to my potential.

09:04.745 --> 09:08.513
I went to work for cat Grant
because I thought working
in a media company

09:08.515 --> 09:11.650
run by a powerful woman
who actually shapes
the way people think

09:11.652 --> 09:13.418
would be the way that I could
make a difference.

09:13.420 --> 09:17.122
But, instead, I just
fetch layouts and coffee.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.391
You always wanted
to be normal, right?

09:19.393 --> 09:23.562
So, having a crappy boss and
absolutely nothing to wear...

09:23.564 --> 09:27.165
-This is what
normal looks like.
-I am not normal!

09:27.167 --> 09:29.768
I have the same powers
he does.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.470
I can lift a bus,
stop a bullet.

09:32.472 --> 09:35.106
Alex, I can fly.

09:35.108 --> 09:38.743
At least, I think I can.
I haven't done it in years.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.478
Kara,

09:40.480 --> 09:44.783
you've got a good job,
you're cute, and thanks
to your alien DNA

09:44.785 --> 09:46.718
-you can't get pimples.
-(Chuckles)

09:46.720 --> 09:48.887
Life is not so bad.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.189
But, if you really
wanna help somebody,

09:51.191 --> 09:54.993
you'll pick between
one of these two, so
i can get on my plane.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.430
-Uh, yep.
-Good choice.

09:58.432 --> 10:01.499
When in doubt, go with blue,
it is your color. All right.

10:01.501 --> 10:05.303
Text me every detail from
your date and I will call you
when I'm back from Geneva.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.272
-I love you.
-Love you.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.114
(Music playing)

10:16.116 --> 10:18.850
So, where you from originally?

10:18.852 --> 10:20.485
Like where was I born?

10:20.487 --> 10:22.020
Um, uh, north.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.389
(Cell phone vibrating)

10:24.391 --> 10:27.292
(Chuckles) I gotta
hit this back real quick.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.064
Man: Check please.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.699
Make sure
your number's on it.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.235
(Sighs)

10:37.237 --> 10:38.203
Man on TV:
<i> If you're just joining us,</i>

10:38.205 --> 10:39.871
<i> shortly after take-off,</i>

10:39.873 --> 10:43.241
<i> national city airlines,</i>
<i> flight 237 bound for Geneva,</i>

<i> The pilot seems to be</i>
<i> circling the city</i>

10:48.315 --> 10:50.749
<i> after apparent engine failure.</i>

10:50.751 --> 10:52.384
Did he say Geneva?

10:52.386 --> 10:53.785
Alex.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.186
(Siren wailing)

11:37.531 --> 11:38.863
(People screaming)

11:38.865 --> 11:42.200
We just lost another engine.
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.412
(People screaming)

11:55.882 --> 11:57.382
(Indistinct shouting)

11:57.384 --> 11:59.150
Pilot: <i> Flight attendants,</i>
<i> brace for impact.</i>

(Metal clanking)

12:18.205 --> 12:20.505
(Engine roars)

12:22.309 --> 12:23.675
We're leveling off.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.415
Oh, come on!

12:41.027 --> 12:42.260
(Grunting)

12:42.262 --> 12:43.895

12:43.897 --> 12:45.230

12:45.232 --> 12:46.598

13:47.294 --> 13:48.893
<i> appear to have</i>
<i> a guardian angel.</i>

13:48.895 --> 13:52.463
<i> When, what many report</i>
<i> to be a female flying form...</i>

13:52.465 --> 13:55.200
-(Squeals) Oh, my god.
<i> -...Rescued them</i>
<i> from certain death.</i>

13:55.202 --> 13:57.202
<i> Leyna nguyen</i>
<i> is live at the scene.</i>

13:57.204 --> 14:00.572
<i> Thank you, Rick.</i>
<i> Guardian angel or</i>
<i> human wrecking ball?</i>

14:00.574 --> 14:02.140
-What?
<i> -There is destruction</i>

14:02.142 --> 14:04.342
<i> all over Otto binder bridge.</i>
<i> And one...</i>

14:04.344 --> 14:06.244
Well, you try saving a plane
for the first time.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.780
See if you
don't make a mess.

14:08.782 --> 14:10.315
(Sighs) Oh, my god.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.284
I know!

14:13.286 --> 14:16.321
-(Giggling) It's incredible!
-(Bones cracking)

14:16.323 --> 14:17.956
-Ow.
-Oh, sorry.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.224
That was...
That was too hard.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.593
I'm just... I'm so excited.

14:21.595 --> 14:25.196
-(Panting) I still can't
believe I did it.
-Yeah.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.565
Neither can I.
Are you okay?

14:27.567 --> 14:30.435
Me? Am I okay?
Are you okay?

14:30.437 --> 14:32.470
-Yes, thank you.
-Were you scared?

14:32.472 --> 14:34.739
I mean, I was scared
too, but you...
You had to be terrified.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.774
Because you had no idea
i was coming to save you.

14:36.776 --> 14:41.145
-I need a drink.
-Right! Yeah,
we need to celebrate.

14:41.147 --> 14:45.083
It has been so long.
I almost forgot how to fly.

14:45.085 --> 14:48.353
Well, not so much "how,"
but more,

14:48.355 --> 14:50.588
more how it feels, like...

14:52.092 --> 14:54.392
Scared, but good scared.

14:54.394 --> 14:59.097
Like, like that moment
right before you kiss someone
for the first time.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.332
And now... now it's like...

15:01.334 --> 15:03.768
I'm not sure
what comes next.

15:03.770 --> 15:06.804
Or maybe I am sure
and I'm just afraid
of what it means.

15:06.806 --> 15:09.607
-And if it means
what I think it means.
-What were you thinking?

15:12.312 --> 15:13.478
(Scoffs)

15:15.115 --> 15:17.115
You exposed yourself.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.250
To the world.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.885
You're out there now, Kara.

15:20.887 --> 15:24.789
Everyone will know about you
and you can't take that back.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.091
I don't want to.

15:28.728 --> 15:32.130
This is what I was
talking about, Alex.

15:32.132 --> 15:35.266
I've always felt
the need to help people,

15:35.268 --> 15:38.436
and tonight
i finally got that chance.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.507
I...

15:42.509 --> 15:46.177
I didn't travel
2,000 light-years
just to be an assistant.

15:46.179 --> 15:49.747
What if people
figure out who you are?

15:50.283 --> 15:51.783
What you are?

15:53.253 --> 15:54.686
It's just...

15:56.823 --> 16:02.560
It's not safe for you
to do anything like that.
Ever again.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.632
Oh.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.470
I'm kind of tired, I...

16:12.472 --> 16:15.840
I just carried a plane on my
back. I'm gonna go to bed.

16:19.913 --> 16:21.913
You should go.

16:21.915 --> 16:23.748
Don't say I didn't warn you.

16:30.457 --> 16:33.091
Man: <i> Good morning,</i>
<i> national city. Our top story,</i>

16:33.093 --> 16:35.193
<i> the only story</i>
<i> anyone's talking about.</i>

16:35.195 --> 16:38.529
<i> -Who is the mystery flying</i>
<i> woman who saved the plane?</i>
-(Elevator bell dings)

16:42.369 --> 16:43.868
(Indistinct talking)

16:45.839 --> 16:47.739
Woman on TV:
<i> Despite extensive efforts,</i>

16:47.741 --> 16:51.676
<i> no one has been able</i>
<i> to identify who,</i>
<i> or rather, what she is.</i>

16:56.016 --> 16:58.983
-Pretty cool, huh?
-A plane-saving lady? (Scoffs)

16:58.985 --> 17:00.618
How is the world supposed
to take her seriously

17:00.620 --> 17:02.787
if she can't even
come up with a suit?

17:02.789 --> 17:05.957
What... Metropolis gets
him and what does
national city get?

17:05.959 --> 17:07.625
Some rookie superhero?

17:11.131 --> 17:17.468
I know many of you
are used to being second
best but it's new to me.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.371
The most incredible event in
the history of national city

17:20.373 --> 17:22.440
and yet we have
no exclusive of any kind.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.043
We don't have much to
go on. The image we're
working off is low res...

17:25.045 --> 17:26.844
I guess she's around 5'9".
It's tough to Gauge

17:26.846 --> 17:28.613
with her height
measured up
against an airplane.

17:28.615 --> 17:32.283
Hair color brown. Or black.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.951
James: Or maybe
her hair is just dirty.

17:35.021 --> 17:37.155
You know, from soot.

17:37.157 --> 17:41.392
-The plane exhaust.
-James, you make
an excellent point.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.860
Do you think
there's any connection

17:42.862 --> 17:46.764
-between this hero and...
-To my friend in blue?

17:46.766 --> 17:49.300
I don't know. I mean,
not that he mentioned,

17:49.302 --> 17:53.938
but if she's anything
like him, she's a hero.

17:53.940 --> 17:57.275
Saving people is what they're
born to do. She'll be back.

17:57.811 --> 17:59.143
Cat: Hmm.

17:59.145 --> 18:01.145
She better be.

18:01.147 --> 18:03.815
This girl is the answer.

18:03.817 --> 18:06.784
She is exactly what I need
to save the <i> tribune.</i>

18:06.786 --> 18:10.988
Besides fatty foods,
there is nothing people
love more than a hero.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.824
We are going to blow her up.

18:12.826 --> 18:16.027
We will feature her
online and in the paper,

18:16.029 --> 18:17.929
but we need images,

18:17.931 --> 18:23.134
we need video, we need
an interview, and exclusive
content. So go.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.569
Go get me that girl.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.171
And, kerah...

18:27.173 --> 18:28.906
Go get me a lettuce wrap.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.578
James: It's funny.
That was the first thing
he did.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.314
Save a plane, I mean.

18:41.187 --> 18:43.421
(Exhales)

18:43.423 --> 18:45.890
Winn, I need
to talk to you on the roof.

18:48.661 --> 18:49.994
The roof?

18:51.865 --> 18:53.264
Kara?

18:53.266 --> 18:55.800
Hey, uh, just whatever
you have to say, can you
make it quick?

18:55.802 --> 18:58.436
I'm not really into
being this high up.

18:58.438 --> 19:01.506
Okay, um, winn,

19:01.508 --> 19:03.608
I'm going to tell you
something about me

19:03.610 --> 19:05.776
that only three people
in my life know.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.845
Can I trust you?

19:08.715 --> 19:10.481
-Yeah, yeah, of course.
-Good.

19:10.483 --> 19:16.020
Um, I just... I really want
someone to be excited
for me.

19:16.022 --> 19:18.222
And I, um...

19:18.224 --> 19:20.358
Right, how do...

19:20.360 --> 19:27.064
Uh, there's something
about me that for most of
my life, I've run from it.

19:27.066 --> 19:31.736
But last night,
i embraced who I am
and I don't want to stop.

19:31.738 --> 19:35.239
Oh, my god,
you're a lesbian.

19:35.241 --> 19:36.807
Oh, Kara, that's
why you're not into me.

19:36.809 --> 19:40.011
-This is, this is great news!
-No. I'm not gay!

19:41.047 --> 19:42.480
I'm...

19:43.750 --> 19:45.016
I'm her!

19:46.853 --> 19:49.854
(Sighs) The woman who
saved the plane!

19:50.790 --> 19:51.956
(Chuckles)

19:53.159 --> 19:55.092
(Chuckling) Okay.

19:56.062 --> 19:57.828
Yeah, okay. Right.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.668
Kara, what are you doing?
Hey, Kara!

20:03.670 --> 20:06.070
Hey, get away
from the ledge,
you're gonna get hurt.

20:09.142 --> 20:10.808
Kara! Hey!

20:17.951 --> 20:19.817
You're... you're her!

20:20.753 --> 20:22.887
Yup. (Chuckling)

20:25.458 --> 20:27.858
Man on TV:
<i> More reports coming in on</i>
<i> last night's plane rescue.</i>

20:27.860 --> 20:31.429
<i> The big question. Is there</i>
<i> a connection between this</i>
<i> mysterious flying woman...</i>

20:31.431 --> 20:33.698
-More coffee.
<i> -...And the man of steel?</i>

20:35.635 --> 20:37.902
-Hey!
-Waitress:
Sorry about that, sir.

20:37.904 --> 20:41.205
Can you believe it?
A female hero.

20:41.207 --> 20:44.141
Nice for my daughter
to have someone
like that to look up to.

20:44.143 --> 20:45.977
Yeah, real nice.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.856
(Bones cracking)

21:01.694 --> 21:03.494
<i> What happened</i>
<i> with the plane, vartox?</i>

21:03.496 --> 21:05.329
<i> You were ordered</i>
<i> to bring it down.</i>

21:05.331 --> 21:06.864
Our trap worked.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.600
The deo agents were on board
and the bomb detonated.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.036
<i> -Then why aren't they dead?</i>
-The female.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.205
She flew into the sky
and caught the plane.

21:14.207 --> 21:15.740
<i> Who is she?</i>

21:15.742 --> 21:19.243
Zor-El saved his child before
Krypton's destruction.

21:19.245 --> 21:22.847
<i> -Alura's daughter.</i>
-She's working
with the humans.

21:22.849 --> 21:23.948
<i> Twelve years</i>

21:23.950 --> 21:26.450
<i> we've been forced</i>
<i> to hide in the shadows.</i>

21:26.452 --> 21:28.252
<i> But the general's</i>
<i> arrival is imminent.</i>

21:28.254 --> 21:30.021
<i> Nothing must interfere.</i>

21:30.023 --> 21:31.722
<i> You are instructed</i>
<i> to eliminate</i>

21:31.724 --> 21:33.124
<i> the human operatives.</i>

21:33.126 --> 21:34.759
<i> You can add</i>
<i> this girl to the list.</i>

21:34.761 --> 21:37.395
Can't promise her
death won't be public.

21:37.397 --> 21:38.663
And messy.

21:38.665 --> 21:41.399
<i> Human casualties</i>
<i> are irrelevant.</i>

21:41.401 --> 21:42.733
Good.

21:45.672 --> 21:49.106
And if she is
alura Zor-El's daughter,

21:49.108 --> 21:52.243
then she will pay
for her mother's debts.

21:52.245 --> 21:53.611
And so will her city.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.520
So, how is it? Huh?
How does it fit?

22:03.790 --> 22:06.324
I'm not flying around
saving people in this thing.

22:06.326 --> 22:09.860
I... I wouldn't even
wear it to the beach.
Where's my cape?

22:09.862 --> 22:12.229
Capes are lame.
Tell your cousin I said so.

22:12.231 --> 22:14.298
Actually, never,
never do that.

22:17.203 --> 22:19.070
(Kara clears throat)

22:19.072 --> 22:20.371
(Inhales sharply)

22:21.541 --> 22:22.606
Oh.

22:24.043 --> 22:26.544
Kara, you look really pretty
without your glasses.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.713
-Winn.
-So, uh...

22:28.715 --> 22:31.082
To be a superhero
you need a crime.

22:31.084 --> 22:34.018
I hacked into the ncpd.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.287
There's a car chase
on the 112 freeway.

22:36.289 --> 22:37.588
I can do a car chase!

22:37.590 --> 22:39.657
(Police siren wailing)

22:45.365 --> 22:47.098
A cape aids
with aerodynamics,

22:47.100 --> 22:48.399
I should have thought of that.

22:48.401 --> 22:49.767
Officer on radio:
<i> West national city bank.</i>

22:49.769 --> 22:51.435
<i> Reporting a 432.</i>
<i> Sixth and spring.</i>

22:51.437 --> 22:52.803
<i> Suspects are armed</i>
<i> and dangerous.</i>

22:52.805 --> 22:54.672
You, uh... you're sure
you're bulletproof?

22:55.608 --> 22:56.674
Hope so.

23:08.654 --> 23:11.722
All right, the new cape
is made from a structured
polymer composite.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.024
It's much sturdier than...

23:14.026 --> 23:16.994
And, uh... (Chuckles)

23:16.996 --> 23:18.963
This one has the "s."

23:18.965 --> 23:21.365
For "super,"
just like your cousin.

23:22.268 --> 23:24.068
It's not an "s".

23:25.405 --> 23:27.671
It's my family's coat of arms.

23:28.474 --> 23:30.408
The house of El.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.276
Officer on radio:
<i> Four-alarm fire</i>
<i> at gates and igle.</i>

23:32.278 --> 23:33.811
I'm assuming
you can't catch on fire.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.583
(Sirens wailing
at a distance)

24:06.746 --> 24:08.045
(Panting)

24:08.047 --> 24:09.180
(Grunting)

24:09.182 --> 24:11.048
Made of low-grade kryptonite.

24:11.050 --> 24:14.218
Radioactive mineral
from your home planet.
It weakens you.

24:14.220 --> 24:17.721
(Panting) Where...
Where am I?
Who are you?

24:17.723 --> 24:19.590
Name is Hank henshaw.

24:19.592 --> 24:22.259
And I believe
you already know

24:22.261 --> 24:23.661
agent danvers.

24:26.532 --> 24:27.998
She doesn't need those.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.438
Welcome to the deo,

24:34.440 --> 24:38.542
the department of
extranormal operations.

24:38.544 --> 24:45.115
The deo monitors and protects
earth from extraterrestrial
presence and/or invasion.

24:46.419 --> 24:47.985
That means you.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.256
Your ship.

24:52.258 --> 24:55.826
We keep it here
as a reminder of the day
you crashed on earth.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.295
You're the reason
for all of this.

24:58.297 --> 24:59.864
Me? But...

24:59.866 --> 25:02.867
My... but my cousin was here
two dozen years before me.

25:02.869 --> 25:06.036
And it was his arrival
that triggered the need
for this organization.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.771
We realized we weren't
alone in the universe

25:07.773 --> 25:11.675
and we might soon be
getting more immigrants.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.644
Sure enough,
you came along.

25:13.646 --> 25:14.945
And with you,

25:16.015 --> 25:17.448
fort rozz.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.884
Fort rozz?

25:19.886 --> 25:22.219
Krypton's maximum
security prison.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.889
Banished to the phantom zone,
same place your ship
got stuck.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.957
But just like yours,
it didn't stay there.

25:32.565 --> 25:35.199
<i> We're not sure</i>
<i> how your pod got loose.</i>

25:37.803 --> 25:39.403
<i> What we do know is this.</i>

25:39.405 --> 25:41.805
<i> You pulled fort rozz with you.</i>

25:44.043 --> 25:46.510
<i> When it crashed,</i>
<i> the alien convicts,</i>

25:46.512 --> 25:49.914
<i> the worst criminals</i>
<i> in the galaxy,</i>
<i> they all escaped.</i>

25:50.683 --> 25:52.149
And you brought them here.

25:53.886 --> 25:58.122
These beings, some of
them have powers from
your darkest nightmares.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.291
For over a decade
they've stayed hidden.

26:00.293 --> 26:04.828
But in the last year many
have been emerging,
making themselves known.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.196
They're planning something.

26:06.198 --> 26:07.831
We're just not sure
what it is yet.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.934
Your plane.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.836
That wasn't an accident.
They were trying to kill you.

26:12.838 --> 26:14.338
I can help you stop them.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.874
How? You couldn't even
stop us from capturing you.

26:17.476 --> 26:19.109
I'm still learning.

26:19.111 --> 26:21.345
Our job is keeping
people in the dark about
alien life on earth,

26:21.347 --> 26:24.415
and nothing says
"covert operation" like
a flying woman in a red skirt.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.951
They know
about my cousin,
they don't fear him.

26:26.953 --> 26:31.021
Plenty of people do, just
not popular to admit it.

26:31.023 --> 26:34.258
You wanna help?
Go back to getting
someone's coffee.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.597
Alex: I know you're mad
and you're hurt.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.298
I wanted to tell you
every single day...

26:41.300 --> 26:44.969
No, instead, you told me
every single day not
to be who I really am.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.804
-You have to listen to me.
-I can't!

26:46.806 --> 26:51.075
This just kind of feels
like one big coincidence,
doesn't it?

26:51.077 --> 26:55.212
You working here,
hunting down aliens,
me being one?

26:55.214 --> 26:56.780
I... I can't help but think

26:56.782 --> 26:59.583
the real reason
that you were recruited
was because of me.

26:59.585 --> 27:03.020
They recruited me because
my background
in bio-engineering

27:03.022 --> 27:05.923
makes me an expert
on alien physiology.

27:06.926 --> 27:08.092
And, yeah,

27:08.094 --> 27:10.461
it helps that I shared
a bathroom with one.

27:10.463 --> 27:11.895
I'm leaving now.

27:11.897 --> 27:14.064
Unless you
wanna try and stop me.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.566
Which I wouldn't.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.169
(Sighs)

27:19.171 --> 27:22.640
I know you don't wanna
hear this, agent danvers,
but she's dangerous.

27:22.642 --> 27:24.908
You, above all people,
should know that.

27:31.050 --> 27:32.549
(Elevator bell dings)

27:34.086 --> 27:35.152
Man on TV:
<i> Of course, leave it to</i>

27:35.154 --> 27:36.587
<i> media magnate, cat Grant,</i>

27:36.589 --> 27:38.522
<i> to put a name to a face.</i>

27:38.524 --> 27:41.625
<i> Miss Grant dubbed</i>
<i> national city's new female</i>
<i> hero, "supergirl."</i>

27:41.627 --> 27:45.996
<i> And if Twitter is any</i>
<i> indicator, the name appears</i>
<i> to be catching on.</i>

27:45.998 --> 27:47.297
"Supergirl"?

27:49.068 --> 27:51.035
We can't name her that!

27:53.839 --> 27:56.040
"We" didn't.

27:56.042 --> 27:59.376
Right, I'm sorry.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.879
It's just, uh...

28:01.881 --> 28:06.150
I don't want to minimize
the importance of this.

28:06.152 --> 28:12.089
(Stammering) A female
superhero. Shouldn't she be
called superwoman?

28:12.091 --> 28:16.126
I'm sorry, darling, I just
can't hear you over the loud
color of your cheap pants.

28:16.128 --> 28:20.731
(Exhales) If we call
her "supergirl," something
less than what she is,

28:20.733 --> 28:25.602
doesn't that make us
guilty of being anti-feminist?

28:26.972 --> 28:30.340
-Didn't you say
she was a hero?
-I'm the hero.

28:30.342 --> 28:32.910
I stuck a label on the side
of this girl, I branded her.

28:32.912 --> 28:37.548
She will forever be
linked to catco,
to the <i> tribune,</i> to me.

28:38.551 --> 28:42.953
And what do you think is
so bad about "girl"?

28:44.724 --> 28:46.023
Huh?

28:46.859 --> 28:48.425
I'm a girl.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.561
And your boss,

28:50.563 --> 28:56.800
and powerful, and rich,
and hot and smart.

28:56.802 --> 29:00.170
So if you perceive
"supergirl" as anything less
than excellent,

29:00.172 --> 29:02.973
isn't the real problem you?

29:04.310 --> 29:06.143
And if you're
so smart, kerah,

29:06.145 --> 29:10.514
could you please give
me one reason why
i shouldn't fire you?

29:11.517 --> 29:13.016
James: I printed it.

29:13.018 --> 29:15.018
And it's an even
higher resolution
than you hoped for.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.754
Cat: James.

29:16.756 --> 29:22.359
You are interrupting
a very craftily
worded termination.

29:24.230 --> 29:26.930
Kara wanted
to surprise you, but she
has a teller friend

29:26.932 --> 29:29.032
that works at
west national city bank.

29:30.469 --> 29:33.704
-The branch
that got robbed.
-Right!

29:33.706 --> 29:35.839
Right, yes, I went there.

29:35.841 --> 29:40.244
You know, it took me
a while to park
my car in the streets.

29:40.246 --> 29:44.081
-The one-way streets are
so confusing. (Chuckles)
-(James clears throat)

29:44.083 --> 29:46.717
-You tell it so much better.
-(Chuckles)

29:46.719 --> 29:50.254
(Clears throat)
Kara convinced her source
to allow us to use

29:50.256 --> 29:52.189
a photograph
that she captured.

30:01.066 --> 30:04.101
You got a clean
image of supergirl?

30:07.339 --> 30:08.672
Kerah,

30:08.674 --> 30:10.574
if you can't take credit when
you do something well,

30:10.576 --> 30:12.476
you are gonna be
at the bottom
of the pile forever.

30:13.946 --> 30:15.345
But, <i> mazel tov.</i>

30:16.482 --> 30:18.715
You bought yourself
another day.

30:20.252 --> 30:23.287
-I was handling the situation.
-Oh, yeah?
What was your plan?

30:23.289 --> 30:25.322
To get yelled at and fired?
'Cause that was working.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.224
I don't need you
or anyone else

30:27.226 --> 30:29.293
-fighting my battles for me.
-(High pitched squeal)

30:29.295 --> 30:31.695
Vartox: <i> I'm communicating</i>
<i> at 50,000 hertz.</i>

30:31.697 --> 30:33.530
<i> -If you</i>
<i> can hear this...</i>
-You okay?

30:33.532 --> 30:35.265
<i> -...you were not</i>
<i> born on this earth.</i>
-I, uh...

30:35.267 --> 30:38.602
Yeah, I... I have a headache.
I need some water.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.637
Painful, isn't it?

30:40.639 --> 30:44.608
<i> The humans of national city</i>
<i> will suffer 10 times this</i>
<i> pain if you don't face me.</i>

30:44.610 --> 30:47.377
<i> Meet me at</i>
<i> the national city power plant.</i>

30:47.379 --> 30:50.013
How many innocent people
are going to die

30:50.015 --> 30:52.616
until you prove that
you are not a coward...

30:52.618 --> 30:54.852
<i> Daughter of alura?</i>

30:54.854 --> 30:56.453
(Breathing heavily)

31:13.138 --> 31:14.571
(Heart beating)

31:14.573 --> 31:17.641
Clever. Picking a spot
lined with lead.

31:18.711 --> 31:20.744
But I can still hear
your heartbeat.

31:22.848 --> 31:24.414
(Kara grunts)

31:26.118 --> 31:28.085
(Panting)

31:31.156 --> 31:33.790
On my planet,
females bow before males.

31:33.792 --> 31:37.160
-This is not your planet.
-You look like alura.

31:37.162 --> 31:39.196
How do you know
my mother's name?

31:39.198 --> 31:41.265
You don't easily forget
the name of the woman who
condemned you to prison.

31:41.267 --> 31:44.635
-Fort rozz?
-She was our judge
and jailer.

31:45.504 --> 31:46.970
Can't kill her.

31:46.972 --> 31:48.705
So killing you
will have to do.

31:59.018 --> 32:00.450
(Groans)

32:02.054 --> 32:03.654
(Vartox grunts)

32:03.656 --> 32:05.289
(Groaning)

32:05.291 --> 32:07.124
(Electricity crackling)

32:10.963 --> 32:14.531
Just because you wear that
symbol on your chest
doesn't mean you're him.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.333
Fighting him
would be an honor.

32:16.335 --> 32:18.302
Fighting you
is just exercise.

32:18.304 --> 32:19.670
(Kara grunts)

32:25.077 --> 32:27.311
You actually think
that you could stop me?

32:27.313 --> 32:29.479
That you'd be able
to stop any of us?

32:33.686 --> 32:35.152
(Groaning)

32:39.959 --> 32:41.291
(Grunts)

32:41.660 --> 32:42.793
(Yells)

32:42.795 --> 32:43.894
(Panting)

32:47.166 --> 32:48.765
Now you know
what it's like to bleed.

32:48.767 --> 32:51.368
Soon, your whole city
will bleed.

32:51.804 --> 32:52.936
(Choking)

32:53.772 --> 32:54.905
(Explosion)

33:05.784 --> 33:08.852
-Trap one, pursue the hostile.
-Man: <i> Copy that.</i>

33:16.662 --> 33:20.864
Hey, hey, I'm here.
I got you, I got you.

33:27.206 --> 33:31.608
-You're gonna be okay.
-I never felt pain like
that before.

33:32.311 --> 33:35.612
Uh, I've never felt pain.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.581
You're not
indestructible, Kara.

33:37.583 --> 33:40.550
Nice move nearly letting
that alien cut you in half.

33:40.552 --> 33:43.920
If we can ID his weapon,
it might give us a way
to defeat him.

33:43.922 --> 33:46.723
Look at that. (Laughs)

33:47.259 --> 33:48.825
You did help.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.697
Did you know
about my mom?

33:53.699 --> 33:56.633
That she was the one who
locked up all those aliens?

33:57.970 --> 34:00.670
It's why I didn't want you
going out there.

34:00.672 --> 34:03.373
Showing yourself,
showing this.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.910
The fort rozz escapees
would give anything

34:06.912 --> 34:12.749
to get revenge on your mother
and the only way that they can
do that now is to hurt you.

34:13.952 --> 34:15.952
I'm trying to protect you.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.387
You were right.

34:18.991 --> 34:20.590
The world doesn't need me.

34:41.713 --> 34:42.913
(Knock on door)

34:42.915 --> 34:46.450
Alex: Kara, it's me.
Can we talk?

34:48.654 --> 34:50.654
I know you can see me.

34:53.158 --> 34:54.891
I know what you're thinking.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.695
That this is all your fault.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.163
But it's not.

35:01.366 --> 35:03.967
Before you came
to live with us,

35:04.736 --> 35:06.603
I was the star.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.140
And then, I mean,

35:10.142 --> 35:12.576
how could I compete
with you?

35:12.578 --> 35:17.013
With someone
who could touch the stars?

35:18.917 --> 35:22.252
You know, I was happy
when you decided
not to use your powers.

35:22.254 --> 35:26.623
You know,
you feeling like less,

35:29.528 --> 35:31.661
somehow made me feel
like more.

35:32.965 --> 35:37.234
Now the world needs
you to fly, Kara.

35:41.006 --> 35:42.973
I can't, Alex.

35:42.975 --> 35:46.076
-I can't do it.
-Yeah, you can.

35:46.879 --> 35:48.411
Your family believes in you.

35:48.413 --> 35:52.115
-I know you do.
-Oh, I don't mean me.

35:54.019 --> 35:56.920
-That's kryptonese writing.
-Yeah.

35:56.922 --> 36:00.624
Hank and his old team
recovered it from the pod
that brought you to earth.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.031
Mom.

36:08.033 --> 36:10.967
<i> Kara, my brave daughter.</i>

36:10.969 --> 36:15.839
<i> By now you have become</i>
<i> the woman I knew you</i>
<i> would grow up to be.</i>

36:15.841 --> 36:19.376
<i> And though you were</i>
<i> sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect young Kal-El,</i>

36:19.378 --> 36:22.145
<i> your destiny</i>
<i> is not tied to his.</i>

36:22.147 --> 36:28.218
<i> There is no correct path</i>
<i> in life. You will lose your</i>
<i> way many times.</i>

36:28.220 --> 36:31.054
<i> What's important is</i>
<i> that you find your way back</i>

36:31.056 --> 36:33.690
<i> to the brave girl</i>
<i> you always were.</i>

36:33.692 --> 36:37.460
<i> Be wise, be strong</i>

36:37.462 --> 36:40.096
<i> and always be</i>
<i> true to yourself.</i>

36:46.505 --> 36:48.071
(Sobs)

36:56.882 --> 36:59.216
So, what do we do now?

36:59.218 --> 37:01.351
First things first.

37:01.353 --> 37:03.453
-You need to change.
-(Chuckles)

37:12.598 --> 37:15.999
It's agent danvers
and her sister
from another planet.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.667
She's here to
help us fight vartox.

37:17.669 --> 37:20.337
I told you
i don't trust aliens.

37:20.339 --> 37:22.505
There's no one
i trust more.

37:22.507 --> 37:25.842
Like her cousin,
she was sent here, too,
to help us.

37:25.844 --> 37:29.846
And if you want
any more of my help,
we're gonna let her.

37:29.848 --> 37:31.147
Vasquez: I found vartox.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.583
Sir. Uh, ma'ams.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.152
Where?

37:36.154 --> 37:38.421
The sliver
of metal you extracted
from supergirl's arm.

37:38.423 --> 37:41.424
Vartox's ax has
a unique nuclear thumbprint.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.526
Satellites picked him up
heading towards the city.

37:43.528 --> 37:46.029
Vartox said he was ready
to start killing humans.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.330
Order a strike team
to intercept.

37:47.332 --> 37:48.732
Your men
will not be able to stop him.

37:48.734 --> 37:50.600
Thank you for your
opinion, miss danvers.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.802
Director henshaw.

37:52.804 --> 37:57.140
People of this city will die
because of something I did.

37:58.010 --> 37:59.442
I started this.

37:59.444 --> 38:01.544
You have to let me stop it.

38:03.248 --> 38:04.681
Make sure you win.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.555
Do you have
eyes on the target?

38:13.992 --> 38:15.292
I got him.

38:30.642 --> 38:31.808
(Explosion)

38:33.378 --> 38:35.445
You never should have
come back for more.

38:37.716 --> 38:38.848
(Grunts)

38:40.385 --> 38:41.618
(Yells)

38:44.222 --> 38:45.555
-(Kara grunts)
-(Vartox groans)

38:46.892 --> 38:48.191
(Grunting)

38:48.960 --> 38:50.460
She's not strong enough.

38:50.462 --> 38:53.496
Why? Because
she's just a girl?

38:53.498 --> 38:55.565
It's exactly what
we were counting on.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.408
I analyzed
the metal on the ax.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.610
It's powered
by a self-generating
atomic charge

39:07.612 --> 39:10.180
reaching temperatures
up to 2500 degrees.

39:10.182 --> 39:12.982
-How does that help?
-If it gets any hotter
than that

39:12.984 --> 39:14.484
it's gonna explode.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.619
She just has to get close
enough to do her thing.

39:17.823 --> 39:19.255
(Grunting)

39:28.233 --> 39:29.532
(Groaning)

39:33.205 --> 39:34.604
(Kara groans)

39:35.874 --> 39:37.240
(Vartox grunts)

39:38.977 --> 39:41.578
Stop, I give up.

39:41.580 --> 39:44.447
-I don't wanna die.
-Give your mother my regards.

39:44.449 --> 39:45.615
(Grunts)

39:46.218 --> 39:47.384
Kara, do it now.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.255
(Kara panting)

39:53.892 --> 39:55.291
(Kara groaning)

39:58.263 --> 40:01.431
It's not working.
I can't do it!

40:01.433 --> 40:03.500
It's why you were sent here.

40:03.502 --> 40:06.336
I believe that now,
you have to believe it too.

40:10.375 --> 40:11.674
(Screaming)

40:18.784 --> 40:20.283
(Breathes heavily)

40:23.121 --> 40:24.454
(Sighs)

40:30.695 --> 40:32.228
It's over.

40:32.230 --> 40:33.663
You think I'm the threat?

40:33.665 --> 40:35.298
(Panting)

40:35.300 --> 40:37.333
You have no idea
what's coming.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.717
(Cheering)

40:55.821 --> 40:58.955
She followed your orders.
She won.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.324
Yeah. This time.

41:01.326 --> 41:03.927
Director henshaw.

41:03.929 --> 41:08.565
I wasn't only recruited
because of my sister, was I?

41:08.567 --> 41:10.600
Yeah, she's why you got in.

41:11.336 --> 41:14.003
You are why you get to stay.

41:23.348 --> 41:26.249
Uh, if... if I believe
the comments
on the website,

41:26.251 --> 41:30.887
they mentioned
a "female/reptilian boxing
match in the desert."

41:30.889 --> 41:33.490
I'll tell you all about it
at our next crime-fighting
lunch hour.

41:33.492 --> 41:34.757
Wait, so the super friends
are back?

41:34.759 --> 41:37.093
We're not calling
ourselves that.

41:37.095 --> 41:39.762
-(Phone ringing)
-Kara: James.

41:39.764 --> 41:44.968
-Uh, do you have time
to grab lunch?
-You must be hungry.

41:44.970 --> 41:48.538
You probably burn up a lot
of calories fighting
an ax-wielding alien.

41:48.540 --> 41:50.006
Meet me on the roof.

42:00.852 --> 42:02.352
You knew.

42:02.954 --> 42:04.587
This whole time.

42:05.757 --> 42:07.290
He told you.

42:07.292 --> 42:09.926
Well, he knew that
i was trying to expand
my own horizons,

42:09.928 --> 42:13.997
so, as a favor, he asked
me to expand them here,
national city.

42:15.467 --> 42:18.568
Hang out. Be near you.

42:18.570 --> 42:20.537
So, so, wait a minute. He...

42:20.539 --> 42:22.572
He wanted me to do this?

42:24.743 --> 42:26.476
Why didn't he just tell me?

42:26.478 --> 42:30.446
-Because he wanted you
to choose it for yourself.
-(Sighs)

42:30.448 --> 42:32.448
The same way he did.

42:32.450 --> 42:34.417
That's what makes
a hero, Kara.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.253
Here.

42:37.255 --> 42:38.555
From him.

42:52.370 --> 42:55.638
It's the blanket
he was wrapped in
when he was a baby.

42:55.640 --> 42:57.874
Apparently, this cape
won't shred.

43:01.913 --> 43:03.446
Thank you.

43:06.051 --> 43:07.517
He's really proud of you.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.054
Me too.

43:11.056 --> 43:14.290
Now, don't you have
a city to protect?

43:14.292 --> 43:17.060
You know... up, up and away?

43:17.796 --> 43:18.962
(Chuckles)

43:24.269 --> 43:27.003
Kara: <i> I was sent here</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

43:27.005 --> 43:30.306
<i> -Turns out he didn't</i>
<i> need my protection.</i>
-(Police siren wailing)

43:30.308 --> 43:33.576
<i> But there's a whole planet</i>
<i> full of people who do.</i>

43:41.620 --> 43:44.387
<i> Earth doesn't have</i>
<i> just one hero anymore.</i>

43:44.389 --> 43:46.289
<i> Now it has me.</i>

43:46.291 --> 43:48.524
<i> Now it has supergirl.</i>

43:51.630 --> 43:53.696
The commander:
General, vartox is dead.

43:53.698 --> 43:55.698
He chose death over capture.

43:55.700 --> 43:58.668
General: Typical of his race.
The commander:
He did accomplish one thing.

43:58.670 --> 44:00.403
The identity of the girl.

44:00.405 --> 44:03.873
It seems
she is alura's daughter.

44:05.243 --> 44:06.976
My dear little niece.

44:08.013 --> 44:09.646
Of course.

44:11.216 --> 44:13.016
She escaped with her cousin.

44:13.018 --> 44:15.652
A much less of a threat
than he is to our endeavors.

44:15.654 --> 44:17.420
You're wrong.

44:17.422 --> 44:20.823
If she's anything like
her mother, she will be
just as formidable.

44:21.359 --> 44:22.925
It was my right

44:22.927 --> 44:25.194
to lead Krypton,
i will lead earth.

44:26.464 --> 44:27.797
We all will.

44:28.733 --> 44:30.366
Find her and kill her.

44:30.368 --> 44:31.934
Are you certain, general?

44:32.570 --> 44:34.203
After all,

44:34.205 --> 44:36.806
Kara Zor-El is your blood.

44:36.808 --> 44:39.776
No one can be allowed
to stand against us.

44:41.146 --> 44:42.512
Not even my niece.
