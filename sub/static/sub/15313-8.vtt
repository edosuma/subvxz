00:22.631 --> 00:24.758
Much! Saracen raid!

00:24.834 --> 00:27.132
The King's under attack. Much!

00:56.834 --> 00:58.801
Master...

01:04.775 --> 01:05.970
Master!

01:06.676 --> 01:09.111
- You're wounded.
- Get help.

01:09.179 --> 01:11.943
The King's tent. Now.

01:12.350 --> 01:13.442
Now!

01:16.753 --> 01:18.221
Your Majesty!

01:50.155 --> 01:54.252
- Acre?
- Yes.

01:58.363 --> 02:00.024
It's his birthday today.

02:00.099 --> 02:02.226
The King.

02:02.301 --> 02:06.204
Gisborne is celebrating in Locksley.
Can you believe that?

02:06.272 --> 02:09.070
The great and the good
raising their cups in your house,

02:09.142 --> 02:12.703
to a man who wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

02:12.779 --> 02:15.577
Without you there would be no
birthday to celebrate.

02:15.648 --> 02:17.513
Can you imagine them,

02:17.584 --> 02:21.714
the Sheriff and his cronies and their syco...

02:21.788 --> 02:23.779
sycophantic...

02:24.924 --> 02:26.289
It's galling...

02:27.962 --> 02:29.326
In Locksley?

02:29.395 --> 02:31.295
More than galling.

02:33.501 --> 02:34.899
What?

02:37.138 --> 02:39.265
Hm!

02:39.340 --> 02:42.173
Why don't we celebrate the King's birthday too?

02:42.243 --> 02:44.040
Hm?

02:45.145 --> 02:47.979
- What do you say?
- There is something wrong with you.

02:48.048 --> 02:50.107
- Mm-hm.
- I'm serious.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.498
What is it?

03:39.168 --> 03:40.691
What is it!?

03:40.770 --> 03:43.102
This is Robin's house.

03:43.172 --> 03:45.140
Look at these people.

03:46.943 --> 03:51.847
My lords, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you for your attendance here today.

03:53.550 --> 03:56.677
As you know, we are here
to celebrate the King's birthday.

03:56.752 --> 03:59.482
We wish him success in the Holy Land...

04:01.424 --> 04:05.725
and we pray for his speedy return
to these shores.

04:08.765 --> 04:11.734
Please, raise your goblets in a toast.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.564
- To King Richard.
- King Richard.

04:23.480 --> 04:27.075
I myself have a particular reason to hope
for the King's early return to England.

04:28.719 --> 04:30.984
For when that day comes,

04:31.055 --> 04:32.544
this fair lady, Marian,

04:34.626 --> 04:36.821
has consented to be my wife.

04:49.174 --> 04:50.937
Before I toast my future bride,

04:51.944 --> 04:54.811
there is something I would like
to present to her.

04:57.749 --> 04:59.614
May I?

04:59.684 --> 05:01.312
You leave me little choice.

05:01.387 --> 05:04.788
- I thought you had already made your choice.
- I have.

05:06.759 --> 05:08.693
This means so much to you, doesn't it?

05:08.761 --> 05:12.219
This means everything to me.
Have I not expressed myself?

05:13.332 --> 05:15.426
You mean everything to me.

05:26.145 --> 05:28.478
My lords and ladies,

05:28.548 --> 05:30.640
I give you...

05:30.716 --> 05:32.150
the future Lady Gisborne.

05:37.023 --> 05:38.251
Have we missed the speeches?

05:44.264 --> 05:46.255
Hood! I don't remember inviting you.

05:46.333 --> 05:49.235
Since when has a man needed
an invitation to his own house?

05:49.303 --> 05:50.735
I don't know.

05:50.804 --> 05:53.466
Perhaps he lost all rights to the house
by becoming an outlaw?

05:53.540 --> 05:57.032
I would have declined anyway.
My men and I are here on business.

05:57.110 --> 06:01.980
Please, everyone, if you could assist us
by removing all your jewelry and valuables,

06:02.049 --> 06:05.506
and handing them
to that man over there. Much?

06:05.586 --> 06:10.046
And then proceed to that room
where you'll all wait quietly until we've gone.

06:11.092 --> 06:12.753
Do as he says.

06:12.828 --> 06:15.455
Wise decision, Gisborne.

06:16.531 --> 06:21.332
Well come on, move it!
Move it! Get up there.

06:23.537 --> 06:27.234
This way please, my friends. Thank you.

06:27.308 --> 06:30.038
Look on the bright side.
Don't be shy.

06:30.112 --> 06:32.478
You'll sleep well tonight, knowing your donations

06:32.547 --> 06:35.516
will be feeding the poor of
Nottinghamshire by this time tomorrow.

06:55.138 --> 06:56.696
- Signal.
- Nearly done.

06:58.574 --> 07:00.303
Master?

07:00.376 --> 07:01.843
So...

07:01.910 --> 07:04.641
- Robin, this is ugly...
- Yes, this is ugly.

07:04.714 --> 07:06.079
This is my house.

07:06.682 --> 07:09.116
- So, Marian...
- Back off, Locksley.

07:09.185 --> 07:11.779
Marian does not carry money about her person.

07:11.854 --> 07:13.719
- How do you know?
- He is right.

07:13.790 --> 07:17.123
- I do not carry money.
- My compliments.

07:17.193 --> 07:22.154
You're very wise to take precautions when there
are so many unsavory characters around.

07:22.232 --> 07:25.201
- But this ring?
- Robin, signal.

07:28.705 --> 07:30.103
You've taken everything else, leave that.

07:30.173 --> 07:32.301
- Robin...
- What?

07:32.376 --> 07:34.071
The signal!

07:35.579 --> 07:38.878
- Please...
- We should do this again. It was entertaining.

07:38.949 --> 07:40.678
With any luck once will be enough.

08:06.779 --> 08:09.076
- Surprise!
- It was you?

08:09.147 --> 08:11.446
Do not pretend that you do not love war.

08:11.516 --> 08:13.450
- I've seen you fight.
- When?

08:13.518 --> 08:15.315
I do not recall.

08:24.597 --> 08:26.895
Robin, what's the matter with you? Wake up!

08:26.966 --> 08:28.092
Ah!

08:33.138 --> 08:35.265
Food poisoning?

08:45.886 --> 08:48.081
Master!

08:48.154 --> 08:49.553
Guy, leave him.

08:49.623 --> 08:51.386
I don't think so.

08:53.226 --> 08:54.693
What has he taken?

08:54.761 --> 08:56.729
Trinkets, a few purses... nothing.

08:56.796 --> 08:58.286
He has your ring.

09:01.401 --> 09:04.166
Your parties are much more fun than mine.

09:44.179 --> 09:47.342
Is this what you're after?

09:47.416 --> 09:48.644
Take it.

09:57.359 --> 10:00.055
- Who else, Gisborne?
- Who else what?

10:00.128 --> 10:05.294
You do not travel to the Holy Land
to try and kill the King of England on your own.

10:05.367 --> 10:07.733
At least you don't.

10:07.804 --> 10:09.236
You're not that clever.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.637
Are you surprised the King has enemies?

10:13.376 --> 10:15.707
He has no idea.

10:15.777 --> 10:18.713
He would make peace with the Turk.

10:18.781 --> 10:20.749
And there will never be peace with the Turk.

10:20.817 --> 10:23.308
You made sure of that.

10:23.386 --> 10:26.184
Dressing as Saracens
and attacking your own King.

10:26.255 --> 10:28.018
I did what was necessary.

10:28.091 --> 10:30.059
For whom?

10:30.793 --> 10:32.192
The Sheriff?

10:33.162 --> 10:34.652
Is he behind this?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.762
Who else?!

10:39.903 --> 10:43.669
I will find out, and when I do,
I will see you all hang for treason.

10:43.741 --> 10:45.867
Oh, and when will that be?

10:45.942 --> 10:47.535
When the King returns.

10:48.579 --> 10:51.514
I wouldn't hold your breath if I were you.

10:51.582 --> 10:53.447
The King will return.

10:53.517 --> 10:56.350
If the King returns...

10:57.788 --> 10:59.415
I still win.

11:00.357 --> 11:02.348
I win Marian.

11:09.701 --> 11:11.669
What are you gonna do now? Cut my other arm?

11:11.736 --> 11:14.067
No, I'm going to kill you.

11:14.138 --> 11:15.572
No!

11:16.874 --> 11:19.275
Killing we do not do.

11:19.344 --> 11:21.039
That's what you taught us.

11:21.112 --> 11:24.707
We do not take part in bloodshed
unless absolutely necessary.

11:37.963 --> 11:39.520
That was necessary.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.998
Hang on. Where 's Djaq?

11:47.540 --> 11:48.905
I think you should see this.

11:48.974 --> 11:51.704
He's been acting like this since
you brought him in.

11:51.777 --> 11:53.506
He's up to no good.

11:53.579 --> 11:54.944
There.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.215
What? He's not doing anything.

12:00.286 --> 12:03.119
That's how I know. They never do nothing.

12:03.189 --> 12:04.952
They always try something.

12:05.024 --> 12:06.855
Something's wrong.

12:06.926 --> 12:11.125
With your permission, my lord, I'd like
to have him hanged sooner rather than later.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.202
What's that around his neck?

12:19.272 --> 12:23.072
- What is it, pretty boy?
- Must be some sort of heathen magic.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.442
I don't like it. And I don't like him.

12:26.380 --> 12:29.314
- I'm glad you got me here for this.
- Thank you, my lord.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.908
A clue - no.

12:31.986 --> 12:36.922
The next time you get me here for no reason,
I shall see you inside the cell, not outside it.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.982
Do you understand me?

12:39.093 --> 12:41.425
- Yes, my lord.
- I thought you would.

13:55.371 --> 13:57.363
I knew it.

13:58.375 --> 14:00.343
Heathen magic.

14:04.915 --> 14:06.473
Djaq is our priority. She's one of us.

14:06.550 --> 14:09.314
How long before Gisborne's men
come looking for their master?

14:09.386 --> 14:11.354
I need to sort this and I need to sort this now.

14:11.422 --> 14:15.256
This man is a traitor.
He tried to kill the King!

14:16.327 --> 14:18.727
Look, I'm not being funny, but...

14:18.796 --> 14:20.696
- I didn't see it.
- Nor did I.

14:26.471 --> 14:28.439
You sent me for help, remember?

14:29.974 --> 14:33.843
You were about to kill him.
What happened to your famous justice?

14:33.912 --> 14:36.506
- Trials and evidence and...
- I'm telling you, it was him.

14:36.581 --> 14:38.708
He's not even trying to deny it!

14:39.985 --> 14:42.510
He tried to kill the King in Acre.

14:42.587 --> 14:46.524
He stabbed me and left me for dead
and then he went for the King.

14:46.591 --> 14:48.115
Then have him tried in public.

14:48.193 --> 14:51.356
Then he's seen to be a traitor.
You kill him here, he's a victim.

14:51.429 --> 14:55.764
- I thought you said a Saracen stabbed you.
- That was before I realized it was Gisborne.

14:55.835 --> 14:57.358
Well, get your story straight.

14:57.436 --> 15:00.269
I've told you I fought him! I cut his arm!

15:00.339 --> 15:03.433
- His tattoo! Look!
- You didn't mention tattoos.

15:03.509 --> 15:05.875
I don't remember tattoos.

15:05.945 --> 15:08.675
Anyway, that's not the point. The point is...

15:08.748 --> 15:10.739
They've got Djaq.

15:12.184 --> 15:13.617
We can't leave her.

15:16.355 --> 15:19.085
- We've got to get Djaq, Robin.
- They could be torturing her.

15:19.158 --> 15:21.490
Do any of you understand what treason is?

15:21.560 --> 15:22.926
I understand what torture is.

15:22.996 --> 15:26.396
Robin, we go to Nottingham. For Djaq.

15:27.668 --> 15:30.466
This... is for England.

15:34.674 --> 15:36.040
And this is for England too.

15:38.512 --> 15:39.570
Robin!

15:44.117 --> 15:45.880
Sorry.

15:51.792 --> 15:53.886
Bottled hellfire, my lord.

15:54.796 --> 15:56.558
Melts solid iron?

15:57.565 --> 15:58.691
It's the devil's work.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.591
Did you make this yourself, my friend?

16:05.273 --> 16:07.537
Oh, come on, do tell.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.244
Solid iron...

16:17.586 --> 16:21.021
Ooh, ouch. Vicious stuff. Nasty.

16:21.089 --> 16:23.819
Very. Shall we have him killed now?

16:23.892 --> 16:26.292
Killed? Don't be so ridiculous.

16:26.361 --> 16:30.458
If he can make more of this,
I might even kiss him.

16:52.389 --> 16:54.380
Sorry.

16:56.393 --> 16:58.691
- This is difficult.
- Untie me.

16:58.762 --> 17:01.322
That's... That's the difficult bit.

17:02.399 --> 17:04.799
John said...

17:04.901 --> 17:06.232
Little John said.

17:07.002 --> 17:09.733
I think we should wait until they get back.

17:11.574 --> 17:13.701
- Do you want some water?
- Much.

17:13.777 --> 17:15.676
Untie me. Now!

17:15.744 --> 17:17.737
I knew this would happen.

17:19.182 --> 17:20.707
That man betrayed England.

17:23.186 --> 17:26.519
The slaughter in the Holy Land continues
because of him.

17:26.589 --> 17:30.048
- The others would not understand.
- Then you must make them understand.

17:30.127 --> 17:32.118
Exactly.

17:32.196 --> 17:33.663
I need to talk to him.

17:35.566 --> 17:38.730
And I cannot do that tied to a tree.

17:38.803 --> 17:40.964
- Just untie me.
- You promise me?

17:42.973 --> 17:45.101
Because earlier...

17:45.177 --> 17:46.940
earlier you were not yourself.

17:47.012 --> 17:48.775
You were...

17:50.549 --> 17:52.483
I'm doing it.

17:54.952 --> 17:57.183
Now, you've had an upset.

17:57.989 --> 18:01.152
You need to just sit down, have a nice, hot...

18:02.594 --> 18:03.754
Robin!

18:03.829 --> 18:05.660
Who else was in the plot to kill the King?

18:05.730 --> 18:07.527
What are you going to do if I don't talk?

18:07.599 --> 18:09.123
I will kill you.

18:09.201 --> 18:11.135
I will kill you whether you talk or not.

18:11.203 --> 18:12.501
No.

18:12.572 --> 18:14.335
You've changed, Locksley.

18:14.407 --> 18:16.272
You told me so yourself.

18:16.342 --> 18:19.106
"Show me an argument ever
settled with bloodshed," was it?

18:19.178 --> 18:23.615
You've become a peace-lover, warm and woolly,
taking trinkets for the poor.

18:23.683 --> 18:27.278
What are you doing?! You promised me!
You said you would explain things!

18:27.353 --> 18:29.913
- How is this explaining things?
- They are simple men.

18:29.989 --> 18:33.550
They've spent years hiding in the forest.
They cannot understand politics.

18:33.626 --> 18:35.719
What has happened to you?

18:35.795 --> 18:39.322
I have not hidden in the forest,
and I cannot understand this.

18:39.398 --> 18:43.164
That, Much, is because you are also simple.

18:51.011 --> 18:52.410
I did not mean that.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.674
I have never seen you like this.

18:55.382 --> 18:57.077
And may I say I am glad?

19:24.379 --> 19:25.368
Whoa!

19:25.446 --> 19:28.006
- Delivery for the castle.
- Toll charge, ha'penny.

19:33.888 --> 19:35.583
Daylight robbery.

19:37.792 --> 19:41.661
- Here! I know you fellas, don't I?
- Go on!

19:51.340 --> 19:55.003
See? Who needs Robin?
As easy as shelling peas.

20:03.786 --> 20:05.515
Alchemy!

20:05.588 --> 20:08.114
Marvelous idea.

20:08.191 --> 20:09.657
Frustrating results.

20:09.725 --> 20:11.091
But...

20:11.160 --> 20:14.061
Especially if you're my alchemist.

20:14.129 --> 20:15.495
This...

20:17.601 --> 20:19.592
is my last one.

20:21.605 --> 20:24.403
Inkwell. Poor fellow.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.339
Good boy.

20:26.409 --> 20:27.842
Handsome.

20:27.911 --> 20:29.880
A bit like you.

20:32.516 --> 20:33.948
Soft hands.

20:35.353 --> 20:38.288
But his alchemy, well,
it was wretched, depressing.

20:38.356 --> 20:41.518
Listen, I have to say, I was very depressed.

20:43.060 --> 20:48.191
But then you came along
with your wonderful Saracen.

20:48.266 --> 20:49.665
What is it?

20:49.733 --> 20:51.964
Zayt al-Zaj.

20:53.170 --> 20:56.298
Well, whatever. Hm?

20:56.374 --> 20:59.741
A liquid that can burn through solid metal.

21:01.145 --> 21:03.706
Well, who'd have thought? So...

21:03.782 --> 21:05.806
I want you to make me up a batch.

21:05.883 --> 21:08.148
I do not know how.

21:14.358 --> 21:16.121
I need particular ingredients.

21:16.193 --> 21:19.789
- I do not see them here.
- We have guards over there on the door.

21:19.864 --> 21:22.163
They'll get you whatever it is that you need.

21:22.234 --> 21:24.225
You have, shall we say... two days?

21:24.336 --> 21:25.963
Joke.

21:26.038 --> 21:27.369
Two hours.

21:45.525 --> 21:46.856
This is wrong.

21:48.594 --> 21:52.621
Master... This is wrong.

21:52.700 --> 21:54.894
I'm not going to kill him.

21:56.235 --> 21:58.204
Just make him talk.

22:09.416 --> 22:11.179
The plot against the King.

22:14.321 --> 22:15.788
I want names.

22:15.856 --> 22:20.225
What kind of King deserts his people
to fight someone else's war in a foreign land?

22:20.294 --> 22:23.388
If you are his people,
then he was right to desert them.

22:27.935 --> 22:29.835
No! Stop!

22:29.903 --> 22:31.302
I will not take part in this.

22:31.372 --> 22:34.900
You will regret this.
You will see sense and you will regret it.

22:34.976 --> 22:36.534
This does not concern you, Much.

22:36.611 --> 22:39.603
You are my master. Everything concerns me.

22:40.615 --> 22:45.314
I have followed you into battle.
I have followed you into the forest.

22:45.387 --> 22:48.254
But I will not follow you into torture.

22:48.323 --> 22:50.621
Then leave me.

22:50.692 --> 22:53.183
- If I thought you meant that...
- Go!

23:04.607 --> 23:06.301
Oh...

23:06.374 --> 23:09.572
You seem to be short of friends, Locksley.

23:10.212 --> 23:12.646
And what about all those peasants
you've championed?

23:12.714 --> 23:16.617
They'll be so disappointed when they realize
that under your fine words,

23:16.685 --> 23:20.018
you're just as violent as the next man.

23:20.090 --> 23:22.250
And not just the peasants either.

23:22.324 --> 23:24.657
Some of the nobles you've championed.

23:24.728 --> 23:27.958
Swayed by your charitable acts.

23:28.030 --> 23:30.124
Edward...

23:31.301 --> 23:32.665
Marian...

23:45.415 --> 23:47.383
Make no mistake.

23:47.452 --> 23:50.443
This ends here, traitor!

24:45.310 --> 24:48.542
Don't suppose anyone's given any thought
as to how we get back out again?

24:48.615 --> 24:51.082
Later! W e came for Djaq.

25:14.707 --> 25:16.676
Face it, you're loyal to a weak King.

25:16.744 --> 25:19.542
- A King with principles.
- He's a pawn and you know it.

25:19.613 --> 25:23.174
- It's not England's war, it's Rome's.
- Then why have you made it worse?

25:23.250 --> 25:26.412
Your attack broke the ceasefire.
There could have been peace.

25:26.486 --> 25:32.118
There will always be war. So let's have a King
who will fight for our gain, not the Pope's.

25:32.192 --> 25:33.989
Do you know why I went to war?

25:35.029 --> 25:36.291
To recover Jerusalem.

25:36.363 --> 25:38.297
To recover our Holy Land.

25:38.365 --> 25:39.992
- How noble.
- No.

25:40.801 --> 25:43.827
When I got there,
I met the Muslims and the Jews.

25:43.904 --> 25:45.735
And I saw it was their Holy Land, too.

25:45.807 --> 25:47.741
What are you, Locksley, Lord of the Dance?

25:55.150 --> 25:58.586
And you were right,
there will always be war,

25:58.653 --> 26:02.144
as long as people like you revel
in their own ignorant bigotry.

26:13.768 --> 26:16.396
- I have finished.
- So quickly?

26:16.471 --> 26:17.996
We can test it on your outlaw friends.

26:18.073 --> 26:23.341
According to my kitchen master,
they've arrived already. They're so predictable.

26:23.412 --> 26:26.279
Oh... Were you expecting to be rescued? Hm?

26:27.183 --> 26:30.379
They won't think of looking for you in here.

26:35.925 --> 26:37.859
What are you doing?

26:40.262 --> 26:41.355
What are you doing?!

26:44.967 --> 26:46.434
Guards!

26:52.442 --> 26:53.965
Get on your knees!

26:54.043 --> 26:55.670
Guards!

26:55.745 --> 26:57.373
Stop the fire!

26:57.447 --> 26:58.846
Sound the alarm!

27:04.187 --> 27:05.518
Guards!

27:11.995 --> 27:14.759
- There 's no one here.
- That can't be right.

27:14.831 --> 27:16.799
No prisoners. Not even a jailer.

27:18.235 --> 27:20.830
I'm not being funny,
you don't think this could be a...

27:26.344 --> 27:27.674
Trap.

27:30.648 --> 27:33.139
Listen, gents, why don't we just
talk about this, eh?

27:56.742 --> 27:58.903
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

27:58.977 --> 28:01.377
- I thought we came to save you.
- Now I'm saving you.

28:01.447 --> 28:04.780
- You're a woman, we're men.
- Irritating, isn't it?

28:11.990 --> 28:15.222
Where now? Do you actually have a plan?

28:15.295 --> 28:18.287
I've never been in this part of the castle.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.888
Have you?

28:19.966 --> 28:22.696
Robin! Where is he?

28:23.737 --> 28:27.798
Well, he is basically...
That's difficult to explain.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.308
- Robin did not come?
- He was, um...

28:30.376 --> 28:33.777
he was... distracted.

28:33.847 --> 28:35.213
Because I am a girl?

28:36.950 --> 28:38.942
Here... Go!

28:43.657 --> 28:45.749
Seen this?

28:45.825 --> 28:47.191
Indoor privy.

28:48.795 --> 28:50.161
So?

28:50.231 --> 28:52.199
So, it leads outdoors.

28:53.167 --> 28:56.000
- Well? Have you got any better ideas?
- Must be another way.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.094
We go. Go! Go! Go!

29:03.944 --> 29:05.935
Catch me at the bottom?

29:15.222 --> 29:18.283
If you were that desperate to go,
all you had to do was ask!

29:21.196 --> 29:22.561
Take him to the dungeon.

29:22.631 --> 29:25.964
If he doesn't want to play nice,
we will play nasty.

29:38.281 --> 29:40.305
We need Robin.

30:02.271 --> 30:05.435
You thought you'd come back from
the Holy Land, covered in glory, didn't you?

30:05.509 --> 30:08.739
Well, guess what. No one here cares...

30:10.479 --> 30:13.574
They couldn't even point
at the Holy Land on a map.

30:13.650 --> 30:15.173
So what was it all for, eh?

30:18.455 --> 30:20.184
Robin of Locksley,

30:20.257 --> 30:22.589
Earl of Huntingdon, hero of Acre.

30:23.660 --> 30:25.958
And look at you now.
You're just a common outlaw.

30:28.265 --> 30:30.256
House and lands lost.

30:32.636 --> 30:36.698
Do you think I don't laugh
every time I go to sleep in your bed?

30:38.775 --> 30:41.710
And Marian, the woman you gave up.

30:41.778 --> 30:43.713
Lost. To me.

30:43.781 --> 30:46.079
You think I won't laugh every time...

30:52.457 --> 30:55.358
To be honest, I was surprised
you decided to stay in Nottingham.

30:55.426 --> 30:58.793
I mean, surely you would have friends elsewhere
that would take you in.

30:58.863 --> 31:00.763
I should have realized.

31:01.666 --> 31:03.658
Marian.

31:04.670 --> 31:06.967
I thought you'd given up long ago.

31:07.038 --> 31:10.475
But you still carry a torch for her, don't you?

31:10.542 --> 31:13.272
And now she is to be mine.

31:14.613 --> 31:16.638
I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.

31:17.416 --> 31:20.078
She has accepted me.

31:22.021 --> 31:23.717
When the King returns.

31:24.624 --> 31:26.614
A detail.

31:27.760 --> 31:31.491
She will know you are a traitor. I will tell her.

31:31.563 --> 31:34.361
- I'll deny it.
- She is astute.

31:34.433 --> 31:36.162
True.

31:36.235 --> 31:38.169
And she has her doubts about me.

31:38.237 --> 31:40.034
But she is also stirred by me.

31:41.341 --> 31:43.172
She will believe my denial.

32:04.832 --> 32:08.791
- What are you doing? You're a killer now?
- When I have to be.

32:08.869 --> 32:09.960
Grow up.

32:11.272 --> 32:13.705
Gisborne made his choice.

32:13.774 --> 32:17.335
Everything is a choice. Everything we do.

32:17.411 --> 32:19.345
- You told me that.
- What choice?

32:22.416 --> 32:25.579
In the Holy Land,
Saracens came to kill the King.

32:26.821 --> 32:29.187
But it wasn't Saracens.

32:30.624 --> 32:33.321
- It was him.
- Rubbish.

32:34.262 --> 32:39.096
He stabbed me and left me for dead.
And then he went to kill the King in his bed.

32:39.166 --> 32:42.136
- I don't believe you. This is about...
- What?

32:42.204 --> 32:44.934
You and me.

32:45.007 --> 32:48.841
I want you to know, I didn't realize
he was going to announce the marriage.

32:48.910 --> 32:50.935
Well, you didn't seem uncomfortable.

32:52.748 --> 32:55.148
I have proof.

32:55.217 --> 32:57.550
His arm. I wounded him. His tattoo.

32:57.620 --> 32:59.349
What tattoo?

32:59.422 --> 33:03.551
- And I was uncomfortable.
- He has a tattoo on his arm.

33:04.426 --> 33:06.725
- You took his ring.
- You took his ring.

33:07.530 --> 33:11.398
How could he have been in the Holy Land?
He was here in your house.

33:18.808 --> 33:20.605
What?

33:22.212 --> 33:26.341
He was unwell for many weeks.
No one was allowed to see him.

33:26.416 --> 33:29.352
- That is why I have to kill him.
- No. Even if you are right...

33:29.420 --> 33:32.820
- I am right.
- A trial. The process of law.

33:32.889 --> 33:34.720
There is no law.

33:35.859 --> 33:40.023
Until Richard returns,
the Sheriff is the law. Gisborne is the law.

33:40.097 --> 33:42.531
And that is why I have to kill him.

33:42.599 --> 33:44.499
No. I forbid you.

33:48.238 --> 33:51.765
- You don't believe me?
- I don't know what to believe.

33:51.842 --> 33:55.006
Guy is not a man who would...

33:56.114 --> 33:57.478
Surely...

33:57.548 --> 33:59.744
Of course.

33:59.818 --> 34:01.410
He is to be your husband.

34:01.486 --> 34:04.148
You know full well I agreed to that
under duress.

34:04.222 --> 34:07.486
You know I have to play things
this way from the inside.

34:07.558 --> 34:09.550
For my father if for nothing else.

34:09.627 --> 34:12.187
I do not have the option
to just run off into the forest.

34:15.835 --> 34:19.132
- What?
- Everything...

34:19.204 --> 34:20.570
is a choice.

34:38.023 --> 34:42.391
Now, look. He's been my master for ten years.
What do you expect me to do?

34:44.463 --> 34:45.862
What happened?

34:50.637 --> 34:52.627
You stink!

34:54.773 --> 34:56.139
Where 's Djaq?

34:57.443 --> 34:59.139
It was a trap!

34:59.211 --> 35:01.476
- We came out through the privy.
- She was right behind us.

35:01.548 --> 35:03.311
They took her back.

35:05.018 --> 35:06.918
Him?

35:07.988 --> 35:09.421
Alive.

35:10.824 --> 35:13.520
It has been somewhat touch and go.

35:15.029 --> 35:16.963
Not since the Holy Land have I seen...

35:19.834 --> 35:22.199
It took all my powers to calm him.

35:23.637 --> 35:26.129
And... and hers.

35:30.745 --> 35:33.373
But it was I who fetched her.
So you could say it was all my doing.

35:34.047 --> 35:35.447
We need him.

35:42.023 --> 35:44.787
- We go to Nottingham.
- I thought you were going.

35:46.460 --> 35:48.223
I have unfinished business here.

35:48.329 --> 35:52.129
- It's Djaq...
- The Sheriff will be expecting a rescue.

35:52.200 --> 35:55.364
It is better to wait. To think.

35:55.437 --> 35:57.132
Robin, wake up! It's Djaq!

35:58.040 --> 36:02.136
You are thinking of just one man. I am thinking
of the King and the whole of England.

36:02.210 --> 36:04.611
Djaq is not "one man", she's a woman!

36:04.680 --> 36:07.114
Have you thought what could happen
if the Sheriff realizes?

36:07.182 --> 36:10.083
"Jack" is a woman? The Saracen?

36:10.152 --> 36:11.813
- Long story.
- He can wait.

36:12.988 --> 36:14.546
- Djaq cannot.
- No.

36:15.824 --> 36:19.090
- If they know we're coming, we could all die.
- True. But it's Djaq.

36:19.161 --> 36:22.096
What does that mean, "True, but it's Djaq"?
It's not even an answer!

36:22.164 --> 36:24.565
But the thing is...

36:24.634 --> 36:27.159
- I like her...
- I think I love her.

36:35.178 --> 36:37.009
Well!

36:38.849 --> 36:41.146
Even then, that is...

36:41.217 --> 36:43.583
that is no reason to knowingly walk into a trap.

36:43.653 --> 36:45.644
Robin is right. You need to think.

36:45.755 --> 36:47.917
Look. That is your solution.

36:47.992 --> 36:49.549
- Trade him for her.
- No!

36:51.729 --> 36:53.856
I am not letting him get away with this.

36:53.930 --> 36:55.398
Robin...

36:59.669 --> 37:01.638
Not sorry.

37:05.175 --> 37:07.871
- Has he talked yet?
- He's just about to start.

37:09.079 --> 37:10.546
Well, hurry up then.

37:14.452 --> 37:17.421
Try and do it quietly. I can't bear bawling.

37:18.656 --> 37:20.647
My Lord Sheriff.

37:21.626 --> 37:22.957
I need your help.

37:29.034 --> 37:31.400
They said to give you this.

37:31.870 --> 37:33.929
Said you'd understand.

37:34.005 --> 37:35.472
This um...

37:35.540 --> 37:37.168
This outlaw. He didn't rob you?

37:37.242 --> 37:39.210
He was only interested in the exchange.

37:39.277 --> 37:41.370
Guy for your prisoner.

37:41.446 --> 37:43.677
My husband-to-be for a Saracen.

37:43.749 --> 37:47.013
You see, something is not right.

37:48.220 --> 37:50.517
How do I know this isn't an outlaw ruse?

37:50.588 --> 37:54.548
Guy is your Lieutenant, your ally...
Your friend.

37:55.795 --> 37:57.160
Friend?

37:59.999 --> 38:03.730
We are talking about the same Guy?
I mean, I hardly noticed he was missing.

38:03.803 --> 38:05.293
My Lord Sheriff, please.

38:05.372 --> 38:07.169
They have Guy.

38:07.240 --> 38:10.903
If they should do anything to him, I...

38:10.977 --> 38:12.307
Yes, all right.

38:14.847 --> 38:17.373
Might just stop your sniveling.

38:17.451 --> 38:21.614
The outlaws will kill Guy
if you harm the Saracen boy.

38:21.687 --> 38:22.712
Have you harmed him?

38:24.791 --> 38:26.121
No.

38:32.633 --> 38:34.998
OK. Prepare the Saracen for travel.

38:48.014 --> 38:49.743
Where is he?

38:49.816 --> 38:51.182
They've taken him.

38:53.654 --> 38:55.019
It was the only way. For Djaq...

38:55.089 --> 38:58.718
It was not their decision to make.
Where have they gone?

38:59.460 --> 39:01.758
- Where?
- I'm not gonna tell you.

39:04.065 --> 39:06.432
- Please, you can't make me.
- If you are my friend.

39:07.269 --> 39:11.035
If you are my true friend,
you must do this one thing for me.

39:12.407 --> 39:13.773
Please.

39:25.687 --> 39:28.315
Robin Hood has gone to
a lot of trouble for you, pretty boy.

39:28.390 --> 39:31.416
Not one rescue, but two.

39:33.061 --> 39:36.657
- He didn't come the first time.
- Aw. Are you feeling unloved?

39:42.272 --> 39:44.330
Ah!

39:44.406 --> 39:47.808
Ah, pretty boy. Not a pretty boy at all!

39:47.877 --> 39:50.243
No wonder they want you
back in the forest, hm?

39:50.313 --> 39:52.941
All those long, cold nights!

39:53.783 --> 39:55.614
Well, obviously...

39:55.685 --> 39:57.676
you won't be going back.

39:58.488 --> 40:01.014
You see Hood, he thinks there
are two tunnels that are clear.

40:01.091 --> 40:03.024
One in, one out. Clever...

40:03.092 --> 40:05.060
But not clever enough.

40:10.867 --> 40:12.267
Where 's Hood?

40:14.038 --> 40:15.402
Here.

40:16.474 --> 40:18.271
Robin. No!

40:18.342 --> 40:20.036
I did not agree to this trade, John.

40:20.110 --> 40:23.637
- Dissent in the ranks?
- I did not agree to this trade.

40:25.816 --> 40:27.181
But I should have done.

40:27.251 --> 40:28.582
Let him go.

40:29.687 --> 40:31.621
It's all right, Hood. Your secret's out, hm?

40:31.689 --> 40:33.156
Your pet Saracen...

40:33.224 --> 40:34.589
is a lady, hm?

40:34.659 --> 40:38.219
The great thing is, she gave me this.

40:38.295 --> 40:40.526
Your secret's out, too.

40:40.599 --> 40:44.557
There is no way Gisborne went to the Holy Land
without your say-so.

40:44.635 --> 40:46.763
Holy Land? Gisborne?

40:46.838 --> 40:51.070
I have proof. On his arm. His tattoo.

40:51.142 --> 40:55.579
People in the King's Guard know about that
tattoo, and when they return, he will pay.

40:56.815 --> 40:58.180
And you will pay.

40:59.252 --> 41:00.718
Tattoo?

41:03.755 --> 41:05.690
- What tattoo?
- No!

41:05.758 --> 41:07.122
Shut up, you big jester!

41:07.192 --> 41:10.093
- Let's go.
- You're not going anywhere. Guards!

41:11.664 --> 41:13.461
Look, an old tunnel! Surprise!

41:13.533 --> 41:16.661
- Gotcha!
- Surprise. An old shaft.

41:16.736 --> 41:17.998
- Surprise.
- Let's go.

41:18.104 --> 41:19.503
Go!

41:21.173 --> 41:22.401
Go!

41:22.475 --> 41:24.306
Another time, Gisborne.

41:32.451 --> 41:34.215
Djaq.

41:36.222 --> 41:37.747
Get on them!

41:37.824 --> 41:39.313
- Get John out.
- Pull!

41:41.628 --> 41:42.821
Pull!

41:52.139 --> 41:55.074
Stop mewling, Gisborne.

41:55.142 --> 41:59.603
Maybe in future you'll think twice
before painting your arm like a girl.

42:13.561 --> 42:14.528
Is it true?

42:14.596 --> 42:17.929
There could have been peace
without this Gisborne?

42:20.001 --> 42:22.163
And yet you gave him up for me?

42:47.162 --> 42:48.493
Brought you some food.

42:49.305 --> 42:55.429
