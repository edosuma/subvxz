00:03.504 --> 00:05.671
Falls church 911,
what's your emergency?

00:05.673 --> 00:07.172
Teen caller: I need help.
I'm in trouble.

00:07.174 --> 00:08.540
Tell me what's going on.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.009
Someone's breaking
into my house!

00:10.011 --> 00:11.043
I need the cops here fast!

00:11.045 --> 00:12.144
All right, where are you?

00:12.145 --> 00:13.244
I'm locked in the bathroom.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.513
I don't think
they know I'm home.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.048
Can you verify your address?

00:16.050 --> 00:17.683
1450 Bradford court.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.719
Wait, I think they heard me.

00:20.721 --> 00:24.223
They're coming!
They're outside the door!

00:24.225 --> 00:26.125
All right, police are
on their way-- stay with me.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.459
Do not hang up.
I won't.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.661
Please hurry.

00:29.663 --> 00:30.796
Oh, no.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.064
What's going on?

00:32.066 --> 00:34.333
Man (Gruffly):
Eric!

00:34.334 --> 00:36.601
Eric, you and Adam open
this bathroom door right now.

00:36.604 --> 00:40.105
You better not be sending 911
to your cousin's house again.

00:40.107 --> 00:42.241
Your mother's
gonna tan your hide.

00:43.511 --> 00:44.643
Listen up.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.146
Prank calling 911
is a serious cri--

00:47.148 --> 00:48.447
(hangs up)

00:50.618 --> 00:53.252
Whatever happened
to "ding dong ditch"?

00:55.089 --> 00:57.122
Falls church 911,
what's you emergency?

00:57.124 --> 00:58.390
Man:
I need help.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.725
I'm in trouble.
(Chuckles)

00:59.727 --> 01:01.260
That's right-- conveying false
information

01:01.262 --> 01:03.762
to emergency services,

01:03.764 --> 01:05.264
with intent to alarm,

01:05.266 --> 01:06.465
is punishable by law.

01:06.467 --> 01:07.566
What?

01:07.568 --> 01:09.635
Woman (Crying):
This can't be happening.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.538
I'm sorry, start again.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.672
What's your emergency?

01:13.674 --> 01:15.140
He's dead.
Who's dead?

01:15.142 --> 01:16.375
He was gonna kill her.

01:16.377 --> 01:17.476
Where are you?

01:17.478 --> 01:19.211
I had no choice.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.480
Sir, I need to know
where you are.

01:21.482 --> 01:24.383
Sir, can you still hear me?

01:24.385 --> 01:26.251
Please, just...

01:26.253 --> 01:28.320
Send someone quick.

01:31.559 --> 01:35.327
¶ ¶

02:02.223 --> 02:04.156
McGee:
Ooh, she's pretty.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.324
Who is she?
Her name's Leah.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.226
Met her last week.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.828
It's the first triple-t I've
been with in about three years.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.464
"Triple-t"--
do I even want to know?

02:12.466 --> 02:15.567
Tall, tasty, trust-funded.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.169
She could buy and sell
us all ten times over.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.303
Lovely.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.705
You, maybe 20 times over.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.140
Watch out!

02:21.142 --> 02:24.176
I'm taking her to fiola's
tonight at 7:00.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.844
Oh, fancy!

02:25.846 --> 02:27.312
How'd you get that reservation?

02:27.314 --> 02:28.914
A buddy of mine
knows the chef.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.550
I had to put down a hundred
bucks to secure the reservation,

02:31.552 --> 02:33.252
non-refundable.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.686
What are you-- crazy?
We're on government salaries.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.188
Yeah, it is
a little crazy,

02:36.190 --> 02:37.322
but I like to live on the edge.

02:37.324 --> 02:40.859
So, what else does Leah do?

02:40.861 --> 02:42.895
I... have no idea.
Hmm.

02:42.897 --> 02:44.580
Where's she from?

02:44.581 --> 02:46.264
She is from--
i have no idea.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.767
Do you talk at all to the girls
that you're dating, ever?

02:48.769 --> 02:50.335
Talking's overrated, mcoprah.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.905
Actually, Tony, I think that
communication is the key

02:52.907 --> 02:54.290
to a solid
relationship.

02:54.291 --> 02:55.674
I find it difficult to take
communication advice

02:55.676 --> 02:58.343
from a guy who talks
to his girlfriend in binary.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.345
(Chuckles)
We speak English, too.

03:00.347 --> 03:01.380
Mm.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.414
I can imagine the pillow talk.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.415
Mm-hmm.

03:03.417 --> 03:04.483
Terrorism,

03:04.485 --> 03:05.617
gun running,

03:05.619 --> 03:06.885
hacking...

03:06.887 --> 03:08.787
It's so hot, McGee.

03:08.788 --> 03:10.688
Actually, we barely talk
about work at home at all.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.958
Yep, it's a rule,
in fact.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.526
We do a thing
called a "download dinner,"

03:14.528 --> 03:15.961
and get the work talk
out of the way.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.596
I'm sorry,
"download dinner"?

03:17.598 --> 03:18.797
Do we want to know what that is?

03:18.799 --> 03:20.649
We set a timer.

03:20.650 --> 03:22.500
We talk about each other's
respective workdays.

03:22.503 --> 03:25.370
Once the timer goes off,
we're done talking about work.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.238
Are you an egg?

03:26.240 --> 03:27.239
I just threw up in my mouth.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.440
Too much information.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.809
We got a body.
Grab your gear.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.911
Do we all have to go? 'Cause
it's getting kind of late.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.813
You got someplace
else to be, DiNozzo?

03:34.815 --> 03:36.415
Nothing that can't be changed.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.449
Not for a nominal fee, boss.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.450
Hundred bucks.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.285
Wasn't exactly nominal.

03:40.287 --> 03:43.488
So much for living
on the edge, huh?

03:45.359 --> 03:46.825
Petty officer: I was on
my way home.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.894
And I saw a woman
being attacked.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.262
The guy had a knife
to her throat,

03:50.264 --> 03:52.397
so I pulled over.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.299
I told him to step away.

03:54.301 --> 03:56.735
He came at me
with his knife and...

03:58.906 --> 04:01.340
Have you been in combat,
petty officer?

04:01.342 --> 04:03.442
Just from the gunner's mount
of a destroyer.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.310
But not like this.

04:05.312 --> 04:07.913
Woman: I was...
Driving down the road

04:07.915 --> 04:09.982
when that guy rammed me

04:09.984 --> 04:13.285
and forced me
to pull over.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.387
(Crying):
And he yanked me out of my car.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.989
Just take a deep breath.

04:16.991 --> 04:19.258
(Inhales, exhales)

04:19.260 --> 04:21.426
Um...

04:21.428 --> 04:23.629
He dragged me over to his SUV

04:23.631 --> 04:25.998
and he threw me inside.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.733
And he put a knife to my neck.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.302
(Grunts)

04:30.304 --> 04:32.471
Thank god that sailor
was driving by.

04:32.473 --> 04:36.008
I... I'd be dead
if it wasn't for him.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.509
You recognize the man
who attacked you?

04:40.014 --> 04:42.748
No, I've, I've
never seen him before.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.416
All right.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.351
The victim say anything
to you before you shot him?

04:46.353 --> 04:47.619
"Victim"?

04:47.621 --> 04:48.820
He's not the victim here.

04:48.822 --> 04:49.855
She is.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.490
I am.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.392
We have no reason
to doubt that, okay?

04:53.394 --> 04:55.627
Hmm.

04:57.364 --> 04:58.463
Boss?

05:03.504 --> 05:04.870
Boss?

05:16.050 --> 05:18.317
At first, I tried
to scare the guy away.

05:18.319 --> 05:21.386
So I fired a warning shot,
but that just...

05:21.388 --> 05:24.389
It just set him off.

05:24.391 --> 05:27.459
So he-he let go of the girl
and then came at me

05:27.461 --> 05:28.860
with the knife.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.429
He didn't say anything?

05:30.431 --> 05:31.496
No.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.931
You say anything to him?

05:32.933 --> 05:35.367
Yeah: Stop.

05:35.369 --> 05:39.104
But he didn't,
so I aimed for center mass.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.540
I fired three times.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.608
Got him with the third shot.

05:46.413 --> 05:48.380
Interesting choice
in sidearms.

05:48.382 --> 05:51.083
Smith & Wesson world war ii
victory revolver.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.918
It belonged
to my grandfather.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.420
He passed away in January.

05:55.422 --> 05:56.888
Our condolences.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.623
The weapon's not registered.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.792
I have the paperwork.
I-i just haven't filed it yet.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.894
To be honest, it-it's
still not easy to look at.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.396
My grandfather
loved that gun.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.731
But it worked well enough,

06:05.733 --> 06:07.899
so I decided to keep it
in my glove box.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.371
Why are you looking
at me like that?

06:12.373 --> 06:13.905
Like what?

06:13.907 --> 06:15.507
Like I've done something wrong.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.980
I told you that guy
was gonna kill that woman.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.915
And then me.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.584
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

06:25.586 --> 06:27.652
Maybe exactly what you did.

06:27.654 --> 06:30.489
But the commonwealth
turned this over to us,

06:30.491 --> 06:32.791
so we need to collect
all the data we can

06:32.793 --> 06:34.493
before we draw any
conclusions, okay?

06:37.464 --> 06:39.564
Sir, I've worked hard
for the Navy

06:39.566 --> 06:41.400
and my future in it.

06:41.402 --> 06:44.035
I just want you to know that.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.575
Hey, Abby.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.811
Hey, McGee, where are
my crime scene vehicles?

06:52.813 --> 06:55.547
Well, uh, Tony is
still working on getting

06:55.549 --> 06:56.848
a tow truck over
to lone pine road.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.484
And Gibbs wanted me
to check in with you

06:59.486 --> 07:00.886
about the antique
from the crime scene.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.422
This is a 1942

07:03.424 --> 07:06.191
Smith & Wesson model 10
victory revolver.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.726
It's got all original parts,

07:07.728 --> 07:09.194
which is why it's
dirty as a dog.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.429
Any prints?

07:10.431 --> 07:12.831
Yep.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.200
Petty officer muldoon's,
as expected.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.702
Anyone else's?

07:17.704 --> 07:18.670
Nope.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.472
Well, that's a yawn.
Totally.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.874
You run a gsr test
on muldoon's clothing?

07:22.876 --> 07:25.210
Yep, double yawn.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.211
Shows that

07:26.213 --> 07:27.712
he fired the weapon.

07:27.714 --> 07:29.481
And I've got the dead guy's
prints on the knife.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.116
And muldoon's story
matches the girl's.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.751
It's pretty straightforward.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.120
Until the other shoe drops.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.188
"Other shoe"?

07:36.190 --> 07:37.456
There's always another shoe

07:37.458 --> 07:39.858
and it always drops.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.210
I don't know, Abby.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.561
I-i think we may be
shoeless on this one.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.896
That's so cute.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.632
Tony:
<i> No, hello?</i>

07:47.634 --> 07:48.800
It's not a joke, ma'am.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.968
I'm not sure I was clear.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.037
You ex-husband is...

07:54.041 --> 07:55.774
Our victim's got
three ex-wives.

07:55.776 --> 07:58.677
And not one of them wants to
come down and I.D. The body.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.011
And the one I spoke with

08:00.013 --> 08:01.480
asked where to send
the thank-you note.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.248
I have no idea
how to relate to that.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.217
Let's go.

08:05.219 --> 08:06.852
Our victim.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.554
Our dead guy
is Mitchell grafton, 39.

08:09.556 --> 08:10.489
No family,
lives alone.

08:10.491 --> 08:12.624
Cited dozens of times

08:12.626 --> 08:14.593
for drunk
and disorderly conduct.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.495
Three arrests
for drug trafficking,

08:16.497 --> 08:17.496
two for battery

08:17.498 --> 08:18.497
and one for sexual assault.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.532
All in all, a lovely guy.

08:20.534 --> 08:21.900
Shooter.

08:21.901 --> 08:23.267
Petty officer second class
James muldoon.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.387
Spotless record.

08:25.388 --> 08:27.505
Except for all these awards.
That's a lot of ribbons.

08:27.508 --> 08:30.809
Nearly every expert marksman
certification there is.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.078
On top of that, when muldoon
wasn't off being a super sailor,

08:33.080 --> 08:35.247
he volunteered for

08:35.249 --> 08:37.516
"stand tall for teens,"
a nonprofit that works

08:37.518 --> 08:38.583
with at-risk kids.

08:38.585 --> 08:39.885
It's basically,
this guy is, like,

08:39.887 --> 08:41.520
just super awesome.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.188
So we've got a known
sex offender

08:43.190 --> 08:45.524
being taken out by
a decorated hero.

08:45.526 --> 08:48.560
Doesn't get much
simpler than that.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.533
Boss, you want us
to go to the base,

08:54.535 --> 08:55.667
talk to his C.O., or...?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.069
We could

08:58.071 --> 08:59.704
try muldoon's shipmates.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.273
Tony:
Or we could--
go home.

09:01.275 --> 09:03.275
Good night.

09:03.277 --> 09:04.776
Uh, you mean before
or after we--?

09:04.778 --> 09:05.844
Before I change my mind.

09:14.655 --> 09:15.720
You, too, bishop.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.291
Go home.

09:19.293 --> 09:20.943
We'll pick it up
in the morning.

09:20.944 --> 09:22.594
Yeah, I've got some
paperwork to finish up.

09:30.571 --> 09:31.570
(Humming happily)

09:31.572 --> 09:33.772
Mm-hmm.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.607
Hmm.

09:35.609 --> 09:39.311
(Sings happily)

09:39.313 --> 09:40.879
All right...

09:40.881 --> 09:42.714
You're up, frank.

09:42.716 --> 09:45.650
There we go.

09:45.652 --> 09:48.153
Tonight is the night.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.221
(Humming)

10:02.369 --> 10:04.903
(Whistling jauntily)

10:04.905 --> 10:06.605
(Glasses ring)

10:12.779 --> 10:13.979
(Clicks tongue)

10:13.981 --> 10:16.681
(Exhales)

10:16.683 --> 10:19.117
I will serve no wine
before its time.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.318
Uh-huh.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.153
What do you think of that, Kate?

10:22.155 --> 10:24.222
Oh.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.394
Warm it up.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.795
The heat is on.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.230
Ooh!

10:38.138 --> 10:40.171
Woof!

10:40.173 --> 10:41.873
All right.

10:41.875 --> 10:45.076
(Imitating McConaughey):
All right, all right, all right.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.145
(Chuckles)

10:48.815 --> 10:51.249
Yeah.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.752
Delilah:
<i> So, I cross-referenced</i>
<i> the names</i>

10:53.754 --> 10:55.086
in the chat room
with the no-fly list,

10:55.088 --> 10:56.788
and got a match.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.723
We arrested the suspect
before noon.

10:58.725 --> 10:59.824
Nice.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.294
Ah, nice timing, too.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.263
Thank you.
All right, your turn.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.398
Give me the download.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.085
All right, well...

11:10.086 --> 11:10.835
It was actually a pretty
normal day at the office.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.637
Not much happened...

11:12.638 --> 11:14.438
Except a case came in
in the late afternoon.

11:14.441 --> 11:17.676
There was a shooting
on lone pine road.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.044
Oh, that's
the middle of nowhere.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.446
A petty officer
drove by a woman

11:21.448 --> 11:23.314
who was being held
at knifepoint by a guy.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.983
So he shot the guy,
saved the woman.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.051
Huh.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.453
So the shooter's a hero.

11:28.455 --> 11:29.454
Looks that way.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.289
That's a nice change.
Yeah.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.992
You know, at least
until Abby's shoe drops.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.995
Ah, there's always a shoe
which always drops.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.430
You know what, I'll honest.

11:38.432 --> 11:40.298
I don't think there are
any shoes on this one.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.267
I think we're shoeless.

11:42.268 --> 11:44.235
All right, well, then tell
me about the petty officer.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.304
Um, well...

11:47.874 --> 11:50.709
He said that he left work,

11:50.711 --> 11:53.078
he stopped by a place called
Mick's convenience store,

11:53.080 --> 11:55.180
got some groceries
and headed home.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.481
(Shushing)

11:57.784 --> 11:59.751
Do you hear that?
Hear what?

11:59.753 --> 12:01.720
The sound of your
first shoe dropping.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.321
I'm not following.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.757
And you know what?
I think I need a new analogy.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.592
(Laughs)

12:07.593 --> 12:09.426
Okay, you said the attack
happened off lone pine road.

12:09.429 --> 12:12.297
Yeah.
Okay, my uncle used
to live in that area,

12:12.299 --> 12:13.798
and he would take us
to Mick's all the time

12:13.800 --> 12:14.866
when we were growing up,
for ice cream.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.501
Okay.
Tim...

12:16.503 --> 12:19.170
Mick's convenience store
is in Arnold's corner.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.005
And Arnold's corner--

12:21.007 --> 12:23.174
is in the opposite direction
of lone pine road.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.943
Nowhere near the shooting.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.079
(Timer dings)

12:28.081 --> 12:29.814
All right, work's done.

12:29.816 --> 12:31.883
Time to eat.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.422
Why would the petty officer
lie to us?

12:45.899 --> 12:48.032
(Sighs quietly)

13:03.550 --> 13:06.117
(Clattering)

13:24.971 --> 13:27.038
(Sighs)

13:30.043 --> 13:31.142
(TV playing)

13:33.980 --> 13:35.046
(Turns off TV)

13:46.259 --> 13:47.959
So, we could do
Hawaii this year,

13:47.961 --> 13:49.994
but I've been there
so many times.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.262
You know what
i was thinking?

13:51.264 --> 13:52.263
Turks & Caicos.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.932
Ever been?
No.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.000
Well, would you like to go?

13:57.838 --> 13:59.871
Tim?

13:59.873 --> 14:01.840
Would you like to go?
Go where?

14:01.842 --> 14:03.608
You're still thinking
about the case, aren't you?

14:03.610 --> 14:05.877
No, no...
Tim, we've
talked about this.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.612
If we don't leave work at work,
then it's work 24-7.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.047
And then there's nothing for us.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.448
I know.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.951
Okay, so then...

14:12.953 --> 14:15.420
Just push the case out
of your mind until it stays out.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.322
Please?

14:17.324 --> 14:18.523
And eat.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.024
I did not spend
two hours making you dinner

14:20.026 --> 14:21.125
for you to stare at it.

14:21.127 --> 14:22.427
You're absolutely right.

14:22.429 --> 14:23.628
I apologize.

14:23.630 --> 14:24.963
Good boy.

14:24.965 --> 14:25.930
Now, if you'll excuse me,

14:25.932 --> 14:27.182
I need to use the ladies' room.

14:27.183 --> 14:28.433
But when I get back,
i want to talk about

14:28.435 --> 14:30.401
the most boring, normal things
in the world, deal?

14:30.403 --> 14:31.436
Deal.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.872
Okay.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.037
Dinner was fantastic.
Thank you.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.572
My pleasure.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.275
You ready for dessert?

15:10.277 --> 15:12.677
I could be talked into it.

15:12.679 --> 15:15.213
The cat has enough food
for the night.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.448
Oh!

15:17.450 --> 15:20.685
I thought you had a dog.

15:20.687 --> 15:24.055
No, um, I am a cat person.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.424
Oh.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.693
Meow.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.995
I like cats.
Hmm.

15:30.997 --> 15:33.998
Bobcats, alley cats,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.134
wildcats...

15:36.136 --> 15:37.702
Stray cats.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.437
(Laughs)

15:39.439 --> 15:42.140
(Gasps)

15:42.142 --> 15:43.441
Well...
How funny.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.709
I thought you said
you had a dog.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.477
Nope.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.379
I'm a cat person.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.081
Well, where is she?

15:50.083 --> 15:51.582
Here, kitty, kitty.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.284
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.587
Unfortunately, frank
died a few weeks ago.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.589
Oh, you poor thing.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.458
I am so sorry.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.328
Do you want
to talk about it?

16:03.330 --> 16:05.430
I could use a hug.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.732
Oh...

16:07.734 --> 16:10.001
Let me take your coat.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.439
It's beautiful.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.007
Thank you.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.143
Nice place.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.044
Thank you.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.479
I never get to enjoy it.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.981
I'm always working.

16:22.983 --> 16:26.484
Oh, right, and you
are a federal agent.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.419
Something I have
never dated before.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.421
Tell me.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.756
Where do you keep your gun?

16:31.758 --> 16:33.491
I keep it
in a secure place.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.059
Until it's needed.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.461
And, uh, how do you know...

16:36.463 --> 16:38.730
When it's needed?

16:38.732 --> 16:40.765
A man and his gun have a...

16:40.767 --> 16:42.667
Special relationship.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.035
Sounds like you take
good care of it.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.470
I have to.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.372
A gun that isn't well-maintained

16:47.374 --> 16:50.141
could cost someone their life.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.578
Hmm... (Chuckles)

16:56.716 --> 16:57.648
What's wrong?

16:57.650 --> 16:58.716
Why would a marksman

16:58.718 --> 17:00.385
maintain his weapon so poorly?

17:00.387 --> 17:02.086
What?

17:02.088 --> 17:03.721
Never mind.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.725
(Both chuckle)

17:20.040 --> 17:21.039
What are you doing?

17:21.041 --> 17:22.373
Petty officer muldoon's car.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.108
Something about it's
always bugged me.

17:24.110 --> 17:26.244
Oh, yeah?
He parked
all the way back here.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.047
Pretty, pretty far back
from these two cars.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.281
Huh.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.816
I can see that.

17:31.818 --> 17:35.386
All the way back
by the bread roll Boulder.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.289
And muldoon said he saw
the attacker holding a woman

17:38.291 --> 17:39.590
with a knife to her throat.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.125
But she was supposedly
already in the car

17:41.127 --> 17:42.560
when muldoon pulled up.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.596
So how would've been able
to see a detail like that

17:45.598 --> 17:48.099
all the way back here,
when the attack was up here?

17:48.101 --> 17:49.467
How could he see that attack?

17:49.469 --> 17:50.802
How could you
<i> not</i> see the attack

17:50.804 --> 17:52.503
that's about
to take place right here?

17:52.505 --> 17:54.472
Download dinner is over.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.207
And you destroyed
the real dinner!

17:56.209 --> 17:57.141
Delilah, hold on, I just...

17:57.143 --> 17:58.209
Well... oh, yeah?

17:58.211 --> 18:00.144
Oh, what you just...?

18:00.146 --> 18:01.729
You were the one that said
the whole thing about

18:01.730 --> 18:03.313
getting ice cream from Mick's
in the opposite direction.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.715
Really! You're gonna,
you're gonna try

18:04.717 --> 18:06.551
to blame me for this?
I'm the one who ruined dinner?

18:06.553 --> 18:07.652
Danger, Tim Robinson.

18:07.654 --> 18:08.786
I did not say
that dinner is ruined.

18:08.788 --> 18:09.821
Dinner is not ruined.

18:09.823 --> 18:10.822
Dinner's fine.

18:10.824 --> 18:12.090
Dinner's not ruined
for anyone.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.691
I can eat.
I can still eat this.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.127
Oh, okay, fine.
(Chuckles)

18:16.129 --> 18:19.097
Eat it.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.566
Okay.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.313
(Sighs)

18:38.751 --> 18:41.652
Victoria was pretty adorable
today, grandpa ducky.

18:41.654 --> 18:44.222
She was making, uh,
pig and duck noises.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.256
(Oinks)

18:45.258 --> 18:46.157
Quack, quack, quack.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.259
Adorable.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.861
Yes, as you can imagine,
quack-quack noises

18:49.863 --> 18:53.264
were very popular in my family
when I was growing up.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.832
That's because you didn't
grow up on a farm.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.434
We didn't have
to make animal noises.

18:56.436 --> 18:57.435
They did it for us.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.903
You're working late.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.839
Well, not much happening
at my place these days.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.574
Caught up on some work.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.744
Thought I'd check in with
you guys before I headed out.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.412
We, uh, verified
the cause of death.

19:08.414 --> 19:12.517
Yeah, Mr. grafton died
from a spinal injury...

19:12.519 --> 19:14.852
Due to a gunshot

19:14.854 --> 19:16.287
to his abdomen.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.489
Courtesy of this
.38-caliber slug

19:18.491 --> 19:20.358
we played from his t7 vertebra.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.226
Died within a matter of seconds.

19:22.228 --> 19:23.928
So, yet again,
no surprises.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.164
Ooh, I didn't say that.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.331
Ooh, what?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.467
(Chuckles)
Well, this man was lying

19:29.469 --> 19:31.169
on his left side

19:31.171 --> 19:33.704
when we arrived
at the crime scene.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.407
But postmortem lividity
indicates that he was

19:36.409 --> 19:39.710
originally lying on his right.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.612
So, somebody moved
grafton's body?

19:41.614 --> 19:43.247
After he was killed.

19:43.249 --> 19:44.882
Witnesses never said
anything about that.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.951
The other surprise we found
was the time of death.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.520
Once we had accurate
outdoor temperature readings,

19:49.522 --> 19:51.222
we were able to redefine

19:51.224 --> 19:54.392
our time of death
to 2:15 P.M.

19:54.394 --> 19:58.329
Petty officer muldoon didn't
call 911 until an hour later.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.797
Which begs the question...

19:59.799 --> 20:03.367
What happened in that hour?

20:05.338 --> 20:07.305
You don't actually play, do you?

20:07.307 --> 20:10.308
Well, yeah, a little.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.510
You know, I don't like
to bother the neighbors.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.712
Walls are thin.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.215
Plus, as you can tell,

20:17.217 --> 20:19.383
I'm kind of shy.
(Chuckles)

20:19.385 --> 20:21.485
You know,
"strangers in the night"

20:21.487 --> 20:23.988
is one of my favorite songs.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.224
You don't say.
What a coincidence.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.226
You have to play for me.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.860
Oh, I couldn't.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.996
No.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.731
Okay.
(Chuckles)

20:38.504 --> 20:39.804
Oh.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.506
Fasten your seatbelt.

20:42.508 --> 20:44.809
(Playing glissando)

20:51.451 --> 20:53.384
Just a little, is that right?

20:53.386 --> 20:55.253
(Laughs)

20:55.255 --> 20:57.622
¶ Strangers in the night ¶

20:57.624 --> 21:00.458
¶ exchanging glances ¶

21:00.460 --> 21:02.360
¶ wandering in the night ¶

21:02.362 --> 21:05.329
¶ what were the chances ¶

21:05.331 --> 21:07.331
¶ we'd be sharing love ¶

21:07.333 --> 21:09.300
¶ before the night was ¶

21:09.302 --> 21:12.270
¶ through? ¶

21:12.272 --> 21:14.472
you are very, very good at that.

21:14.474 --> 21:15.973
(Chuckles)
Are you as good

21:15.975 --> 21:17.341
with that gun of yours?

21:17.343 --> 21:19.310
¶ I never miss a shot ¶

21:19.312 --> 21:22.847
¶ even at high noon ¶

21:22.849 --> 21:25.449
¶ how on earth did petty... ¶

21:25.451 --> 21:29.387
¶ officer muldoon? ¶

21:29.389 --> 21:33.457
¶ it took him three shots ¶

21:33.459 --> 21:35.626
¶ to nail that ¶

21:35.628 --> 21:38.429
¶ guy... ¶

21:38.431 --> 21:39.797
I don't think those
are the words.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.365
He's an expert marksman.

21:42.902 --> 21:45.002
Maybe we should skip the song.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.604
Sounds great.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.706
So, um, what
did you have in mind

21:48.708 --> 21:50.775
for an encore?

21:52.378 --> 21:54.478
How do you feel
about mystery novels?

21:54.480 --> 21:55.613
You mean, like books?

21:55.615 --> 21:56.747
Yeah, books.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.316
Uh... (Mutters)

21:58.318 --> 21:59.583
Who doesn't love a good story?

21:59.585 --> 22:00.718
Good.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.353
'Cause I got one
i want to run by you.

22:02.355 --> 22:04.455
You're gonna love it.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.065
Why aren't you at home?

22:14.067 --> 22:15.966
I want to talk
about the case.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.935
Told you we'd
pick it up tomorrow.

22:17.937 --> 22:21.339
Says the man staring
at crime scene photos.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.909
I spoke to ducky and Jimmy
before I left,

22:24.911 --> 22:26.644
and they think that--
the body was moved?

22:26.646 --> 22:29.347
Oh, they called already?

22:29.349 --> 22:30.548
Nope.

22:30.550 --> 22:33.117
Then, how did you...?

22:33.119 --> 22:36.087
There's blood spatter
on the handle and on the sheath,

22:36.089 --> 22:37.555
but there's none on the blade.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.574
The knife must've been
in the sheath then.

22:39.575 --> 22:41.592
If grafton was holding it out,
the blade would be bloody, too.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.894
Crime scene was staged.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.497
Ducky said that muldoon
waited over an hour

22:46.499 --> 22:49.734
to call 911 after
the shooting.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.068
(Wry laugh)

22:51.070 --> 22:52.536
If we're gonna work,

22:52.538 --> 22:54.038
you got any food around here?

22:54.040 --> 22:56.040
I have three TV dinners.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.809
No, I need some food with
a little bit more food in it.

23:00.146 --> 23:02.413
Then let's go get something.

23:19.065 --> 23:21.132
Lights out.

23:23.669 --> 23:25.069
Really?

23:25.071 --> 23:27.605
You're just gonna let me
pretend like I'm sleeping?

23:27.607 --> 23:29.673
Lights on.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.744
Look, Delilah...

23:33.746 --> 23:35.413
I'm really sorry, okay?

23:36.849 --> 23:39.550
Truly, I'm, I know I've been
acting weird tonight, but...

23:40.820 --> 23:42.887
...there's something
about this case.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.656
Sounds like
every other case to me.
(Sighs)

23:45.658 --> 23:48.092
It's not, though.
It's different.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.094
My gut is telling me...

23:50.096 --> 23:54.932
That the good guys are alive
and the bad guy's dead.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.201
And all the evidence points
that way.

23:57.203 --> 24:01.105
(Sighs) But-but things...
Aren't adding up.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.641
And so I'm questioning,
is my gut wrong?

24:03.643 --> 24:06.043
Do I question that?

24:06.045 --> 24:09.146
Because, you know...
It's a terrible thing to...

24:09.148 --> 24:12.049
In my line of work--
you know, people die that way.

24:12.051 --> 24:15.486
Your gut's telling you
something's not adding up.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.154
But, Tim, we have
to put it all behind us

24:17.156 --> 24:19.173
when we get home.
I don't...

24:19.174 --> 24:21.191
I don't work to be the basis
of our relationship.

24:21.194 --> 24:22.526
(Sighs)

24:22.528 --> 24:25.629
Look what happened
to bishop. I...

24:26.666 --> 24:28.065
What happens one day
if we<i> are</i> allowed

24:28.067 --> 24:30.601
to talk about work
with each other?

24:31.571 --> 24:33.637
(Phone chimes)

24:39.111 --> 24:40.711
Jimmy.

24:40.713 --> 24:43.147
Says the body was moved.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.051
You know what, I can deal
with this tomorrow.

24:50.756 --> 24:53.090
Mm. Lights off.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.859
Lights on.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.660
Who would've moved the body?

24:56.662 --> 24:57.728
What?
I mean,

24:57.730 --> 24:59.263
that's a big deal, right?

24:59.265 --> 25:01.999
Are you testing me?

25:02.001 --> 25:03.834
No, I'm serious.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.603
Okay.

25:05.605 --> 25:08.572
Yes, it is a big deal
that they moved the body.

25:08.574 --> 25:10.140
That means the
witnesses lied to us.

25:10.142 --> 25:11.709
So maybe they were
hiding something.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.210
That's usually what it means.

25:13.212 --> 25:17.548
And maybe the good guy
isn't still alive after all.

25:29.262 --> 25:31.662
Waitress:
Hey, Gibbs.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.998
The usual?
Yeah, that'd be
great. Thanks.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.232
Hi.
Hi.

25:35.234 --> 25:38.068
I'll take a bowl of chili
with onions and cheese

25:38.070 --> 25:39.537
and...

25:39.539 --> 25:42.306
The Turkey Reuben,
Russian dressing...

25:42.308 --> 25:45.175
An order of fries and...

25:45.177 --> 25:47.278
(Muttering)
Let's see...

25:47.280 --> 25:48.612
Uh, pancakes, please.

25:48.614 --> 25:50.714
She hasn't eaten in a week.

25:50.716 --> 25:53.117
(Waitress and Gibbs chuckle)

25:54.220 --> 25:56.987
So, how's your new place?

25:56.989 --> 25:58.289
It's good.

25:58.291 --> 26:00.925
Yeah. Day two
is going great.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.993
I got a sofa.

26:02.995 --> 26:06.764
And I am actually starting
to enjoy the quiet.

26:09.835 --> 26:12.570
And I'm gonna keep telling
myself that until it's true.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.940
So...

26:15.942 --> 26:17.942
Grafton's body was moved.

26:17.944 --> 26:21.211
Which means our witnesses
didn't tell us the truth.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.614
Amy Harrison--
what do we know about her?

26:23.616 --> 26:24.915
McGee was running
her background,

26:24.917 --> 26:27.585
but I can access
her file from here.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.259
Okay. She works in
medical billing.

26:35.261 --> 26:38.329
Nothing unusual in her bank
statements, no arrests...

26:38.331 --> 26:39.997
Huh. Wait.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.732
Not true.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.901
Harrison actually spent
eight months

26:43.903 --> 26:46.070
in a juvenile detention
center in 2005.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.204
For what?

26:47.206 --> 26:48.339
Records are sealed.

26:48.341 --> 26:50.107
They're sealed?
By who, the courts?

26:50.109 --> 26:51.675
It doesn't say.

26:51.677 --> 26:54.178
We need to get back
to that crime scene,

26:54.180 --> 26:55.846
expand the search radius.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.114
If they moved
the body...

26:57.116 --> 26:59.683
Who knows what else they moved.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.988
Tony: The thing is, the gun
petty officer muldoon had

27:03.990 --> 27:06.056
in his glove compartment
was a rare antique,

27:06.058 --> 27:07.358
and that's weird, right?

27:07.360 --> 27:10.027
Very, very weird.
(Chortles)
Thank you!

27:10.029 --> 27:11.962
Because an expert
marksman like that

27:11.964 --> 27:14.698
would have kept
a family heirloom
locked away in a case.

27:14.700 --> 27:17.267
At the very least,
well-oiled and maintained.
(Sighs)

27:17.269 --> 27:19.870
Which was my hope
for the evening.

27:19.872 --> 27:23.407
Any chance for a refill,
inspector clouseau?

27:23.409 --> 27:25.075
Ah. Sure.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.311
(Chuckles)
And speaking of marksmen,

27:27.313 --> 27:29.279
there's no way
petty officer muldoon

27:29.281 --> 27:32.282
would've taken three shots
to drop that guy.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.885
He would've nailed him
on the first shot. He's a pro.

27:34.887 --> 27:38.055
Yeah, well, pros do miss
on the first shot.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.357
(Clicks tongue)
You sure as hell did.

27:40.359 --> 27:41.925
Listen, Tony...

27:41.927 --> 27:44.028
You're clearly
somewhere else,

27:44.030 --> 27:47.031
and I am starting to think
that I should be, too.

27:47.033 --> 27:48.832
Oh, no. I'm-I'm so sorry.
(Clears throat)

27:48.834 --> 27:50.834
Um, please,
give me a second chance.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.236
Here's my e-mail.

27:52.238 --> 27:53.937
Oh.

27:53.939 --> 27:55.406
Okay.

27:55.408 --> 27:57.307
When can I see you again?

27:57.309 --> 28:00.377
Never. I just really want
to know how this case

28:00.379 --> 28:04.181
you've been talking about
for the last hour turns out.

28:07.787 --> 28:11.455
Tow trucks still
aren't here.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.397
We used a 50-foot
radius last time.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.366
Make it 250--
we missed something.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.735
What are we looking for?
Whatever we missed.

28:24.737 --> 28:26.437
Man:
Special agent Gibbs.

28:26.439 --> 28:28.305
Back again.
Yeah.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.340
Thought we'd have a second look.
Suit yourself.

28:30.342 --> 28:31.809
Your friends
are over there.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.010
Our friends?

28:33.012 --> 28:36.346
Boss? Bishop.

28:36.348 --> 28:38.449
McGee? Delilah? What
are you guys doing here?

28:38.451 --> 28:40.084
I imagine
the same thing you are.

28:40.086 --> 28:42.470
McGee:
Guess, uh, Tony was

28:42.471 --> 28:44.855
the only one that was able
to keep this out of his head.

28:51.864 --> 28:54.131
I thank you, good sir.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.200
See, this is why we
shouldn't go home at night.

28:56.202 --> 28:58.368
There's no point.
Where's your date?

28:58.370 --> 29:01.138
Probably the same place your
download dinner went, mcbite me.

29:01.874 --> 29:02.940
No comment.

29:02.942 --> 29:04.041
Okay, what do we got?

29:04.043 --> 29:06.410
Well, muldoon's story
is Swiss cheese.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.378
He lied to us
about where he came from.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.280
I found out the convenience
store is on the opp...

29:10.950 --> 29:12.316
Sorry.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.051
Delilah informed me

29:14.053 --> 29:16.453
that the convenience store
is in the opposite direction.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.388
There's no way he could've
been the shooter.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.124
Or that he was
even attacked.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.426
Grafton wasn't even
holding his knife
when he was killed.

29:22.428 --> 29:23.527
Amy Harrison.

29:23.529 --> 29:25.012
Boss?

29:25.013 --> 29:26.496
It's the only name
we haven't talked about.

29:26.499 --> 29:28.432
DiNozzo, bishop,

29:28.434 --> 29:31.034
canvass the tree line
behind these cars.

29:31.036 --> 29:33.303
McGee, you tear her car apart.

29:33.305 --> 29:34.905
I already did.

29:34.907 --> 29:38.108
I got tired of
waiting in the tow truck,

29:38.110 --> 29:39.543
so I uberpool'd over
with Delilah and McGee.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.979
And you're gonna be
really happy that I did.

29:41.981 --> 29:44.114
You find something?
Yeah.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.984
Okay, so, this vehicle
has Internet

29:46.986 --> 29:49.887
via an onboard
satellite connection.

29:49.889 --> 29:52.923
It makes it, like,
a local Wi-Fi hot spot.

29:52.925 --> 29:55.826
Amy Harrison used that...

29:55.828 --> 29:57.394
To text...

29:57.396 --> 29:59.530
Petty officer muldoon

29:59.532 --> 30:01.865
this afternoon...

30:01.867 --> 30:03.834
<i> After</i> grafton was killed.

30:03.836 --> 30:06.370
She lied to us.
She knew him.

30:06.372 --> 30:07.971
Actually...

30:07.973 --> 30:11.475
She's been texting him
for the last three months.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.143
She knew him really well.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.559
You mind telling me why
I've been dragged off my ship

30:28.561 --> 30:30.828
in the middle
of the night?
Gibbs: Oh, I can't wait.

30:30.830 --> 30:33.481
Tony:
First off, um...

30:33.482 --> 30:36.133
You care to revise the statement
you made to us yesterday?

30:36.135 --> 30:37.868
And why would
i do that?

30:37.870 --> 30:39.937
Because... it's bs.

30:39.939 --> 30:43.841
Tony: Let's look at some
pictures, huh? Okay, so...

30:43.843 --> 30:45.209
Oh, there's you.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.144
And, then, look at all
these pretty ribbons.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.613
There's your pistol marksmanship
ribbon, and that one's

30:49.615 --> 30:51.949
your rifle marksmanship ribbon.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.250
Lot of ribbons.
Good job.

30:53.252 --> 30:54.585
I ranked second
in my division.

30:54.587 --> 30:56.286
Yeah, I know.

30:56.288 --> 31:00.224
But you said it took three shots
to take down grafton,

31:00.226 --> 31:03.060
and you were less
than 20 feet away.
How does<i> that</i> work?

31:03.062 --> 31:05.629
I'd never fired at
a live target before.

31:05.631 --> 31:07.898
My hands were shaking, so...

31:07.900 --> 31:09.633
Gibbs: You wait an hour

31:09.634 --> 31:11.367
after grafton was killed
before you called 911?

31:11.370 --> 31:13.537
I didn't.
Hey, you want our help?

31:13.539 --> 31:14.972
You level with us.

31:14.974 --> 31:16.540
I am.
No, you're not.

31:16.542 --> 31:19.042
You're lying to us.
You lied about where
you were coming from,

31:19.044 --> 31:20.644
you lied about being
attacked with a knife,

31:20.646 --> 31:22.512
and you lied about
knowing Amy Harrison.

31:22.514 --> 31:24.081
She's got nothing
to do with this.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.550
Gibb: We got a dead guy
you say you didn't kill,

31:26.552 --> 31:29.186
and she was
the only other person there.

31:29.188 --> 31:31.255
I was on my way home.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.657
I saw a girl being attacked.
I stopped to help.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.659
The guy came at me with a knife.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.194
I shot him.
That's what happened.

31:37.196 --> 31:40.297
No. That's the story
you rehearsed

31:40.299 --> 31:42.633
for an hour before
you called 911, right?

31:42.635 --> 31:46.136
This is not my first time
doing this, man.
I'm done

31:46.138 --> 31:47.537
talking about this.

31:47.539 --> 31:51.074
I'm officially invoking
my article 31 rights,

31:51.076 --> 31:53.143
and hereby request
a lawyer be assigned to me.

31:53.145 --> 31:54.678
Tony: Hmm.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.513
All right.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.661
What'd you get?

32:10.663 --> 32:14.031
That's his story,
and he's stickin' to it.

32:14.033 --> 32:16.300
What do we have?
McGee:
Well, nothing on the plasma.

32:16.302 --> 32:17.935
Bishop:
Yeah. We usually don't

32:17.937 --> 32:19.937
set that out
till first thing in the morning.

32:19.939 --> 32:21.104
And morning hasn't happened yet.

32:22.708 --> 32:25.042
Improvise.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.010
Like you did with that
dinner I slaved over.

32:27.012 --> 32:29.012
I thought we settled
all of that.

32:29.014 --> 32:30.280
I'll take that.

32:32.017 --> 32:33.517
Okay.

32:33.519 --> 32:35.719
We've got...

32:35.721 --> 32:38.522
A dead guy...

32:38.524 --> 32:41.325
On the road
with a rap sheet

32:41.327 --> 32:43.126
a mile long.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.496
We also have
a hero petty officer

32:46.498 --> 32:48.298
claiming to be the shooter.

32:50.269 --> 32:51.234
Motive.

32:51.236 --> 32:53.503
No idea. But we know

32:53.505 --> 32:55.238
the girl is involved.

32:56.709 --> 32:59.076
Tony, I think you
may have gone a little overboard

32:59.078 --> 33:00.711
with your stick figures'...

33:00.713 --> 33:02.413
Non-sticky parts.

33:02.414 --> 33:04.114
Well, how else are you supposed
to know that it's female?

33:04.116 --> 33:07.084
Unless she starts
nagging me about what
a bad date I am.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.251
Um, long hair?

33:08.253 --> 33:09.753
Skirt.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.221
(Sighs)

33:13.759 --> 33:15.092
Everybody's a critic.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.693
Gibbs:
Abbs.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.762
On my way down.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.731
All right,
we focus on her.

33:20.733 --> 33:22.399
Her juvie record's sealed.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.234
McGee, unseal it.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.169
Hack the department
of corrections?

33:37.082 --> 33:40.183
That's a good look for you.

33:42.321 --> 33:43.754
Abby...

33:43.756 --> 33:46.356
I told you to go home.
Are you kidding me?

33:46.358 --> 33:48.125
And miss an all-nighter?

33:48.127 --> 33:50.527
I feel like I'm 13 years old
at missy trayman's house

33:50.529 --> 33:53.797
when her dad passed out drunk
and we got to stay up till dawn.

33:53.799 --> 33:56.633
Now that I think about it, missy
had a pretty sad childhood.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.368
Okay. You said
you had something.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.669
I do.

34:00.572 --> 34:03.774
Previously, on<i> Abby's lab...</i>

34:03.776 --> 34:06.243
Abby tells McGee
that muldoon's prints

34:06.245 --> 34:08.645
were on the murder weapon.
I know. I read the report.

34:08.647 --> 34:11.748
Later, the entire team
returns to the crime scene

34:11.750 --> 34:13.583
and finds new evidence,

34:13.585 --> 34:15.569
including...

34:15.570 --> 34:17.554
(Taps keyboard)
The spent slugs
from the shooting.

34:17.556 --> 34:18.488
Is this going somewhere?

34:18.490 --> 34:19.456
Yeah.

34:20.192 --> 34:21.792
Muldoon's prints

34:21.794 --> 34:24.761
might have been
on the gun,<i> but...</i>

34:24.763 --> 34:28.165
Amy Harrison's DNA
was on the bullets.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.267
I don't know
whose gun it is,

34:30.269 --> 34:32.736
but she's the one
that loaded it.

34:34.339 --> 34:35.605
This is crazy.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.641
That guy assaulted<i> me, </i>
and I'm the one

34:37.643 --> 34:39.676
being interrogated
in the middle of the night?

34:39.678 --> 34:41.278
Because "that guy"

34:41.280 --> 34:44.214
just happened to have
been a guard at the...

34:44.216 --> 34:46.283
North brook detention center.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.387
Same time you
were there.

34:50.389 --> 34:51.822
So?

34:51.824 --> 34:53.423
You told us you'd
never seen him before.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.359
(Sighs) If I did,
i don't remember.

34:56.361 --> 34:59.696
He brought you your meals
every day for eight months.

34:59.698 --> 35:02.666
Grafton had a record
for drug trafficking.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.568
You were serving time
for drug dealing.

35:04.570 --> 35:07.270
Here you are, years
later, still buddies.

35:07.272 --> 35:08.872
You two became
business partners?

35:08.874 --> 35:10.207
Bishop:
Then what happened?

35:10.209 --> 35:11.408
Something go south with you two?

35:11.410 --> 35:14.177
I'm not a drug dealer.
Just a murderer?

35:14.179 --> 35:16.613
No!
Gibbs: We have your
DNA on the bullets.

35:16.615 --> 35:19.182
The weapon is yours.

35:19.184 --> 35:21.885
And when we find
gunshot residue
on your clothes,

35:21.887 --> 35:23.387
it'll prove you fired it.

35:23.388 --> 35:24.888
(Crying): No. I...
Gibbs: Yeah.
You missed him

35:24.890 --> 35:26.389
with the first
two shots.

35:26.391 --> 35:28.225
You hit grafton with the third.

35:28.227 --> 35:30.760
But the petty officer knew
that we would test<i> his</i> clothes,

35:30.762 --> 35:34.231
so he fired it a fourth time
to contaminate himself.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.365
(Whispers):
This can't be happening.

35:35.367 --> 35:37.300
The only thing we
don't know is why

35:37.302 --> 35:39.803
a decorated Navy sailor
is covering for you.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.174
Are you gonna let him
take the fall?

35:46.645 --> 35:49.346
Wait for it, wait for it...

35:55.320 --> 35:57.687
I wasn't dealing drugs.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.691
(Crying):
I wasn't.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.527
I got...

36:03.529 --> 36:08.165
Busted for a bag of pot
in my locker... (Sniffles)

36:08.167 --> 36:11.568
And I wouldn't rat out the guys
who were dealing it, so...

36:11.570 --> 36:14.571
I ended up
taking the rap myself.

36:14.573 --> 36:17.174
I served eight months,
i got out,

36:17.176 --> 36:19.176
I had my records sealed,

36:19.178 --> 36:22.345
and I never thought
about north brook again.

36:24.283 --> 36:25.916
Until yesterday.

36:25.918 --> 36:28.285
I...

36:28.287 --> 36:30.687
I stopped for gas
in falls church...

36:32.424 --> 36:34.791
...and I saw him.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.660
(Exhales)

36:36.662 --> 36:40.630
It was... it was like
getting punched in the stomach.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.199
I...

36:44.236 --> 36:47.270
I couldn't breathe.

36:47.272 --> 36:49.940
And suddenly,
i was following him in my car

36:49.942 --> 36:52.209
out of the parking lot,

36:52.211 --> 36:55.579
<i>(distorted clattering, gasping)</i>
And these... these memories

36:55.581 --> 36:58.281
just started flashing
through my mind.

36:58.283 --> 37:01.618
(Gasping, sobbing)
<i> The fear...</i>

37:01.620 --> 37:04.254
<i> The smells...</i>

37:04.256 --> 37:06.223
The pain.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.827
I barely remember following him.

37:10.829 --> 37:14.297
I don't remember hitting him
with my car at all.

37:14.299 --> 37:17.000
I... I think it was an accident.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.568
I don't know.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.337
But I...

37:20.339 --> 37:22.672
I do remember

37:22.674 --> 37:26.276
the wave of...

37:26.278 --> 37:29.813
Rage and humiliation

37:29.815 --> 37:32.382
and shame.

37:36.521 --> 37:38.788
(Sniffles)

37:38.790 --> 37:40.857
And he... (Wry chuckle)

37:40.859 --> 37:43.627
He recognized me instantly.

37:43.629 --> 37:45.929
He was at my door,

37:45.931 --> 37:47.998
screaming...

37:48.000 --> 37:51.368
And...

37:51.370 --> 37:53.737
Then I was outside the car,

37:53.739 --> 37:58.041
and he came towards me,
and, uh...

37:58.043 --> 38:02.279
I could hear
the gun going off...

38:03.282 --> 38:05.482
(Sighs deeply)
...And then he was dead.

38:05.484 --> 38:08.918
And I just, I...
I was so scared.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.421
I-i didn't know what to do.

38:11.423 --> 38:13.657
And so...

38:13.659 --> 38:15.592
I called Jim...

38:15.594 --> 38:17.594
<i> (Vehicle approaching)</i>
And...

38:17.596 --> 38:20.530
<i>It was my idea to move the cars</i>
<i> and change the crime scene.</i>

38:20.532 --> 38:22.666
<i> Please... Jim...</i>
<i> Jim didn't want to do it.</i>

38:22.668 --> 38:24.334
<i> He didn't want anything</i>
<i> to do with it,</i>

38:24.336 --> 38:25.969
<i> but i-i begged him</i>
<i> to cover for me,</i>

38:25.971 --> 38:27.070
<i> because I didn't think</i>

38:27.072 --> 38:28.538
that you would understand.

38:31.343 --> 38:32.909
Lying to you...

38:32.911 --> 38:34.544
Was my idea.

38:38.317 --> 38:40.650
It wasn't her idea;
It was mine.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.353
Yeah, we know.
That son of a bitch raped her

38:43.355 --> 38:45.322
for eight months straight
when she was a child,

38:45.324 --> 38:47.057
and nobody did a
damn thing about it.

38:47.059 --> 38:50.327
I wasn't gonna let her go to
jail just because some judge

38:50.329 --> 38:52.095
didn't take that
into account.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.864
She could have argued
self-defense.

38:54.866 --> 38:57.334
Well, I thought my way
had better odds.

38:58.437 --> 39:01.438
Does she know that
you're in love with her?

39:06.345 --> 39:07.410
(Sighs)

39:07.412 --> 39:09.346
No.

39:09.348 --> 39:11.981
I mean, I... I don't know.
I don't think so.

39:11.983 --> 39:14.517
We only met a
few months ago.

39:14.519 --> 39:17.654
We were both volunteering at
the same teen outreach program.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.489
I know.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.791
(Sighs)

39:21.793 --> 39:23.493
We talked a lot.

39:23.495 --> 39:26.663
But just as friends.

39:26.665 --> 39:29.366
She finally told me
about being raped.

39:29.368 --> 39:32.102
She said I was the first
guy she felt safe with

39:32.104 --> 39:34.070
since it happened.

39:34.072 --> 39:37.107
So... how do you jump from that

39:37.109 --> 39:39.609
to "want to grab
a drink sometime?"

39:39.611 --> 39:43.380
I'm the last guy you want
to take advice on women from.

39:43.382 --> 39:45.515
So what now?

39:45.517 --> 39:47.384
She had a case for self-defense.

39:47.386 --> 39:48.918
She still does.

39:49.888 --> 39:53.423
We're not pursuing
obstruction.

39:53.425 --> 39:54.891
Against either of you.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.593
(Sighs)

39:56.595 --> 39:58.128
Assuming...

39:58.130 --> 40:01.398
That you are telling
the truth this time.

40:02.401 --> 40:04.467
Thank you.

40:06.405 --> 40:09.439
McGee:<i> Ah, I can't wait</i>
<i> to take a shower.</i>

40:09.441 --> 40:11.308
Oh, I just want
to crawl into bed.

40:11.309 --> 40:13.176
Delilah: I'm actually looking
forward to going home now.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.844
Good morning,
people at NCIS.

40:14.846 --> 40:15.945
Boss, we can
go home now?

40:15.947 --> 40:17.881
Told you to go home
13 hours ago.

40:17.883 --> 40:19.582
Gibbs.
Tony: Go, go, go.
Let's roll.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.484
Come on.
Where?
Quick, the door!

40:21.486 --> 40:23.019
How many?

40:23.021 --> 40:24.721
