-l'm just making it worse, huh?
-Yeah.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.141
All right, come on.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.968
Here, take a break.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.562
-Yeah?
-Here, come on. Abby's got it.

15:03.612 --> 15:05.898
Just wanted to say
you're a good bartender.

15:05.989 --> 15:09.652
I could tell the first time I saw
you double-checking the inventory.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.859
Glad to have you along for the ride.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.821
-Yeah, we'll see.
-No?

15:15.916 --> 15:19.079
No, I'm just saying you got
something here, but...

15:20.754 --> 15:22.369
It's not exactly my thing, right?

15:22.923 --> 15:24.504
What are you talking about?

15:24.591 --> 15:27.424
We had one of yours in here
right off the bat opening night.

15:27.511 --> 15:29.297
The pretty motherfucker,

15:29.387 --> 15:31.594
looked like he should be
at the opera or something.

15:31.681 --> 15:34.969
-She.
-It was a he.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.221
I could see the fucking
Adam's apple bouncing.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.223
I mean to say Dora prefers "she."

15:39.314 --> 15:40.429
Dora? That's the name?

15:42.192 --> 15:45.434
Okay, Dora.
She is fucking great.

15:45.529 --> 15:47.065
With the fucking lipstick
and the pumps?

15:47.155 --> 15:50.192
I mean, shit like that
makes this place crackle.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.944
A little this, a little that.

15:52.035 --> 15:54.447
lt's New York, you know.
People wanna be surprised, you know?

15:54.538 --> 15:55.698
Yeah.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.950
WOMAN: Come on, baby. It's all right.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.906
They're not gonna say anything.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.161
MAN: Excuse me.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.371
Where were you working before this?

16:06.466 --> 16:09.003
lwas in Brooklyn,
this joint on Smith Street.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.504
A fag bar in South Brooklyn?

16:10.595 --> 16:11.630
Yeah.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.170
And before that,

16:14.266 --> 16:16.632
I worked both weekend shifts
at the Stonewall.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.762
-I know you've heard of that.
-Stonewall?

16:19.646 --> 16:21.011
Come on, man,
even you are gonna remember

16:21.106 --> 16:23.597
a bunch of queers rioting
three nights in a row.

16:23.692 --> 16:26.058
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
the Village, I remember.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.689
-Yes.
-Yeah.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.986
What the fuck happened with that?

16:30.073 --> 16:31.654
One too many raids.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.446
Yeah, it was something, all right.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.027
All right.

16:38.123 --> 16:41.411
Here... To new beginnings.

16:48.550 --> 16:49.960
You picked him up where?

16:50.343 --> 16:51.674
4-2 and 9.

16:52.304 --> 16:54.670
Did you forget what I told you
or are you just hard of hearing?

16:54.764 --> 16:56.629
I told him to let it go.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.846
I think this is the real thing.

16:59.936 --> 17:02.427
-Look, it says "Rolex."
-It says "Rolek," you dumb-ass.

17:02.522 --> 17:06.686
Hey, Sarge, remind Patrolman Alston
here about the no-go.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.858
Simple possession, right?
Had a little H on him was all?

17:08.945 --> 17:11.197
-That's right.
-Cut him loose, Alston.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.818
We took these off
a gypsy on the Deuce.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.109
Maybe now you'll know what time it is.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.702
For me?

17:25.420 --> 17:27.376
WOMAN: Maybe you could go
to the free clinic later.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.500
You think I like boring movies?

17:31.259 --> 17:33.500
MAN: Two wrecked and a whiskey down.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.931
-A little light.
-On my period.

17:40.018 --> 17:42.304
Can't get your fee
for half of nothing.

17:44.147 --> 17:46.058
Then you double up on the sucks.

17:46.441 --> 17:47.726
l'm heavy, Daddy.

17:47.817 --> 17:51.275
Right now my room looks like
the Manson family moved in.

17:51.947 --> 17:53.608
Anyone got a tampon? I'm out.

17:58.036 --> 17:59.276
You're still light.

17:59.371 --> 18:01.703
I love fucking on my period.
Why is that?

18:01.790 --> 18:02.870
Don't need lube.

18:02.958 --> 18:04.949
But some johns ain't up to that mess.

18:05.627 --> 18:06.992
You hear about these sponges?

18:07.087 --> 18:08.418
You stick it up there,

18:08.505 --> 18:10.791
stops the blood long enough to fuck.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.418
Johns can't tell the difference.

18:12.509 --> 18:13.965
But you need to be careful.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.792
Gave me a yeast infection once.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.258
How do you get it out?

18:19.349 --> 18:22.091
Got me a pair of needle-nose pliers
from the hardware store.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.636
Y'all need to keep
your lady business to yourself.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.063
Yeah, you made him squirm.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.616
Ain't too often I see
your running mouth so shut.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.823
My lady's on the rag, stretch.

18:42.914 --> 18:44.324
Can't handle that.

18:44.416 --> 18:46.657
Nothing you can do
but ride the crimson wave.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.833
Yeah, it's all about
the lunar cycle, man.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.915
Like they werewolves or some shit?

18:51.006 --> 18:52.462
Women just be mysterious.

18:52.549 --> 18:55.962
They in sync with the moon.
It's like it does shit to them.

18:56.052 --> 18:59.260
I personally don't mind
a little ketchup on my hot dog.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.046
Man, fuck the goddamn moon.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.052
No, no, now, that's my point, man.

19:03.143 --> 19:06.055
You gotta fuck the moon.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.024
ASHLEY: You gotta get over here
before it gets light, you know?

19:13.111 --> 19:15.193
The trucks that pull up early,
they're looking for it.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.362
-You know what I mean?
-C.C.: I know.

19:17.449 --> 19:19.656
Those delivery boys are lonely.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.485
I earned real good tonight, C.C.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.788
You tired again?

19:27.667 --> 19:29.749
LORI: I can work
the bread trucks, C.C.

19:30.253 --> 19:31.754
Why would you do that?

19:32.380 --> 19:35.497
Give you a break. I don't mind.

19:35.592 --> 19:38.834
Nah, Lori, you coming home
with me to get some shut-eye.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.543
Ashley can service the bread guys,

19:40.638 --> 19:42.594
maybe bring back a loaf or two.

19:43.892 --> 19:44.881
Fuck outta here.

19:58.323 --> 20:01.281
Yo, C.C.,

20:01.785 --> 20:03.025
Ain't my lookout.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.694
I need to deliver.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.618
Yeah, I gotta get going, too.

21:02.137 --> 21:06.176

21:09.894 --> 21:12.226
And the Dow Jones industrials
dropped 13 points...

21:12.313 --> 21:14.599
Remember, I'm going out dancing
after work tonight.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.273
Scouting that new place.

21:20.321 --> 21:22.357
I'm interested in seeing
how their business is run.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.489
What's wrong with a little ambition?

21:29.330 --> 21:30.911
I thought you liked The Hi-Hat.

21:33.376 --> 21:34.456
I do.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.289
Vince isn't a total asshole.

21:38.423 --> 21:40.755
But Midtown's not my scene.
I wanna get back downtown.

21:41.801 --> 21:42.961
Don't be late.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.596

-l'm patient.
-Hey, Bill, take the cash.

22:39.984 --> 22:41.724
You don't wanna mess this shit up
for the other guys.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.684
I already pay the IRS.
I don't need another tax.

22:43.780 --> 22:46.863

That's $100 a month.

22:46.950 --> 22:49.407
And I don't gotta do nothing for it
but sit on my ass for a weekend.

22:49.494 --> 22:51.405
My mother raised me
smarter than that.

22:51.496 --> 22:53.361

meeting you the other day,

23:29.534 --> 23:32.992
and I thought maybe we could go out
sometime, do something.

and put it in the bank,

I lugged an M16 through the boonies

45:56.338 --> 45:57.794
for 12 and a wake-up.

45:57.881 --> 45:59.417
That ain't practical for you.

46:02.302 --> 46:04.384
Smith & Wesson, .38 Special.

46:04.471 --> 46:06.007
Good stopping power.

46:06.181 --> 46:07.512
Police-issue.

46:08.391 --> 46:10.177
This... This is what the cops use?

46:10.560 --> 46:12.346
Yeah, I don't wanna
get caught with that.

46:12.437 --> 46:14.143
What else?
Maybe something smaller

46:14.230 --> 46:16.687
-in case I gotta conceal it?
-What you gonna use it for?

46:16.775 --> 46:18.936
You looking to make a statement, or...

46:19.194 --> 46:21.150
Fixing to do someone permanent?

46:21.988 --> 46:23.273
I don't... No, ljust...

46:23.365 --> 46:25.401
Here, how about...
How about this one?

46:26.284 --> 46:28.400
That's an S&W 60 LS.

46:28.495 --> 46:32.158
.38 stainless steel revolver
with a speed-load cutout.

46:32.415 --> 46:34.997
Yeah, this could work. Looks nice.

46:36.920 --> 46:39.081
-How much?
-60 LS?

46:39.172 --> 46:40.582
I can give it to you for 250.

46:41.549 --> 46:43.835
LS. What's that stand for, LS?

46:43.927 --> 46:45.087
"Lady Smith."

46:45.553 --> 46:46.963
You trying to sell me a lady's gun?

46:48.014 --> 46:49.345
You chose the motherfucker.

46:49.432 --> 46:51.593
Shit, man, I don't know
what I'm fucking doing.

46:54.521 --> 46:57.228
You don't need a gun.
You need a gunman.

46:57.857 --> 46:59.848
-A gunman?
-Piece ain't no thing to me.

46:59.943 --> 47:01.274
It's like part of my arm.

47:04.364 --> 47:05.729
You nominating yourself?

47:06.157 --> 47:09.069
If elected, I'll serve.

47:11.913 --> 47:14.120
JACK: (OVER ANSWERING MACHINE)
I’d really like to see you again.

47:14.207 --> 47:15.822
I’m home by 7:00 most nights.

47:16.668 --> 47:19.125
Okay, hope I hear from you.

47:36.229 --> 47:37.639
Yeah.

48:01.087 --> 48:03.078
VINCE: Here we go.

48:06.468 --> 48:08.004
Think you know that guy.

48:08.428 --> 48:09.964
Big Mike.

48:10.055 --> 48:11.295
Hey!

48:13.933 --> 48:15.469
Cop a squat.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.595
Vincent.

48:17.979 --> 48:18.968
So...

48:19.647 --> 48:21.558
Between the two of youse,
we should be able

48:21.649 --> 48:23.264
to keep this place
running smoothly.

48:23.359 --> 48:25.020
Frankie and me got your back.

48:25.737 --> 48:29.446
Yeah, two Frankies.
That's gonna get confusing.

48:29.532 --> 48:31.363
What if we call you
Black Frankie?

48:31.451 --> 48:33.282
-You okay with that?
-Ain't no thing to me.

48:33.369 --> 48:34.529
All right.

48:37.874 --> 48:39.034
What's your problem?

48:40.168 --> 48:42.284
Your Italian friends
beat up Bill Schmidt

48:42.378 --> 48:43.834
to make some kind of point.

48:44.297 --> 48:46.253
Saying they
worked him over real good.

48:46.341 --> 48:47.626
I didn't... I didn't know.

48:47.717 --> 48:48.957
Well, you sure as fuck
knew their kind

48:49.052 --> 48:50.792
when you got
into bed with them.

48:50.887 --> 48:53.128
Bobby, I had to do something
to get Frankie right with them.

48:53.223 --> 48:55.635
-Fuck Frankie and fuck you!
-Hey, Bobby...

48:55.725 --> 48:58.558
Damn, boy, I've been working for y'all
for less than an hour.

48:58.645 --> 49:00.681
Sound like I might have to shoot
a motherfucker already.

49:01.189 --> 49:02.429
Who the fuck are you?

49:04.818 --> 49:06.274
That's Black Frankie.

49:09.405 --> 49:11.111
(HORNS BLARING)

49:18.289 --> 49:19.995
I would have picked you up
at your place.

49:20.416 --> 49:21.997
Rang the doorbell like a gentleman.

49:22.335 --> 49:24.166
I was already here.

49:25.171 --> 49:26.160
Where to?

49:26.256 --> 49:27.837
This spot is perfect.

49:27.924 --> 49:30.336
I've been tracking that prostitute
in the red dress.

49:31.177 --> 49:32.633
She told me her name was Shirley,

49:32.720 --> 49:35.427
but I heard one of the other girls
call her Diamond.

49:35.515 --> 49:37.756
I thought we were getting
a meal somewhere.

49:38.643 --> 49:41.055
I got you a burger and fries
from Grand Luncheonette.

49:42.105 --> 49:43.720
Eat up before it gets cold.

49:53.491 --> 49:54.947
Just one burger?

49:56.035 --> 49:57.241
You not hungry?

49:57.579 --> 49:59.115
I'll have some fries.

50:02.584 --> 50:04.745
Tell me about those property vouchers.

50:14.053 --> 50:15.213
You sure?

50:16.055 --> 50:18.216
-Yeah, come on.
-All right.

50:26.399 --> 50:29.391
So, you got a son but no wife?

50:30.278 --> 50:32.860
I was married six years.
Been divorced for two.

50:33.156 --> 50:34.236
What happened?

50:36.743 --> 50:38.074
I'm just gonna own up to it.

50:38.161 --> 50:41.824
I cheated on her
with someone at work.

50:42.540 --> 50:43.620
VVasntlove.

50:44.292 --> 50:46.203
Did you tell your wife it wasn't love?

50:48.254 --> 50:49.243
Yeah.

50:50.548 --> 50:52.209
Does that make it okay?

50:54.636 --> 50:55.716
Yeah.

51:00.642 --> 51:02.883
I'm not scoring many character points
with you, am I?

51:05.688 --> 51:07.064
So, what about you?

51:07.148 --> 51:09.013
Ever been married? Any kids?

51:09.108 --> 51:12.271
Nope, no man, no kids.

51:13.529 --> 51:16.236
So... What do you do for work?

51:19.035 --> 51:21.117
Don't ask too many questions, Jack.

51:24.540 --> 51:26.496
You don't go out
on many dates, do you?

51:40.306 --> 51:42.012
I got something for you.

51:52.902 --> 51:55.939
Maybe you can go visit
that aunt of yours.

51:58.574 --> 51:59.780
Danene.

52:03.663 --> 52:04.948
Thanks.

52:10.044 --> 52:11.124
Thank you.

52:23.933 --> 52:26.015
Well...

52:29.230 --> 52:30.515
Maybe we can do this again.

52:30.857 --> 52:31.846
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

52:32.734 --> 52:34.270
Sure, Jack.

52:39.949 --> 52:41.450
Sorry.

52:42.744 --> 52:45.986
No, it's... It'sjust
been a while is all.

53:56.192 --> 53:59.184
Hey, you want me to hang with you?

54:00.071 --> 54:01.902
No. Go get some breakfast, Mike.

54:01.989 --> 54:03.149
I'll be okay.

54:10.540 --> 54:11.700
All right.

54:15.920 --> 54:18.957
You guys want some cocktails?
I can reopen the place.

54:19.215 --> 54:21.126
We had something else in mind.

54:22.427 --> 54:23.416
This about the checks?

54:24.137 --> 54:27.004
-We took care of that.
-Yeah, I heard.

54:28.933 --> 54:31.766
Yeah, and your brother-in-law
is probably upset.

54:31.853 --> 54:34.811
The solidarity of the workers
and all of that kind of shit.

54:35.565 --> 54:38.477
Sometimes you gotta break a few eggs
to make an egg sandwich.

54:39.193 --> 54:40.603
Get in the car, Vince.

54:40.695 --> 54:41.901
Burning gas here.

55:11.642 --> 55:12.631
VINCE: So?

55:13.603 --> 55:16.219
RUDY: Outside these walls
on the street out there,

55:16.647 --> 55:19.935
nothing but backwash,
the lowest of the low.

55:20.651 --> 55:21.811
We can't change that.

55:22.153 --> 55:23.142
But in here...

55:23.821 --> 55:28.565
Well, this can be like
riding your camel for days

55:28.659 --> 55:32.652
in the desert and coming up
on palm trees and cool water.

55:36.334 --> 55:37.540
I don't get it.

55:38.085 --> 55:40.997
I told you there was gonna be
an opportunity coming your way,

55:41.631 --> 55:43.496
a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

55:46.928 --> 55:48.168
So, what am I looking at?

55:48.554 --> 55:49.714
Your future.

55:51.599 --> 55:54.887
I'm telling you, man, she killed
that motherfucker dead.

55:54.977 --> 55:56.968
Girl must have
some goddamn superpower

55:57.063 --> 55:58.052
in that mouth of hers.

55:58.147 --> 56:00.103
Men gonna line up
for that shit when they hear.

56:00.191 --> 56:02.273
Shit, I'm tellin' you.

56:07.114 --> 56:08.320
Shit.

56:08.407 --> 56:11.240
I wonder what the coroner's
report's gonna say.

56:11.994 --> 56:14.451
Stomacide... Death by mouth.

56:14.539 --> 56:17.201
Shit, you think he came
before he went?

56:19.544 --> 56:21.705
-Hopefully, the man was at peace.
-Yeah.

56:21.796 --> 56:23.502
Hey, you guys are buying today.

56:23.589 --> 56:25.204
Frankie's ass-broke.

56:25.299 --> 56:26.334
George.

56:26.926 --> 56:28.962
Hey. Hey, Candy.

56:29.053 --> 56:30.589
We're gonna give you a new name.

56:30.680 --> 56:32.762
What you think of Mouth of Death?

56:54.245 --> 56:56.201
Right there, man.

57:02.670 --> 57:04.160
Fuck you.

57:10.511 --> 57:12.217
Man, fuck all of you.

57:15.683 --> 57:17.924
You impressed everybody
is all, Candy.

57:20.896 --> 57:23.308
-What are you talking about?
-She should be proud.

57:23.399 --> 57:26.766
-Hell, Iwould be.
-What are you talking about?

57:26.861 --> 57:28.852
