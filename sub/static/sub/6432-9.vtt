You're safe.

00:01.593 --> 00:03.695
You're safe.

00:03.730 --> 00:07.132
You came into my house
and stole from me,

00:07.167 --> 00:09.001
and I will respond in kind.

00:09.035 --> 00:10.336
Someone's been getting
in and out

00:10.370 --> 00:11.370
and stealing artifacts.

00:11.404 --> 00:13.639
Why are you trying to hide it
from us?

00:13.673 --> 00:15.774
You're the one cutting me off

00:15.809 --> 00:17.476
from the people
that I care about.

00:23.216 --> 00:24.683
Okay.

00:24.718 --> 00:26.518
Okay, good.

00:26.553 --> 00:29.488
He has not found you yet.

00:32.058 --> 00:34.526
Now...

00:34.561 --> 00:36.929
[Gasps] You.

00:36.963 --> 00:40.532
How did you get into my ware...

00:40.567 --> 00:42.267
DB Cooper's ripcord.

00:42.302 --> 00:44.937
Surely my resourcefulness
doesn't surprise you.

00:48.808 --> 00:51.643
- I wonder what this does.
- No!

00:58.151 --> 01:00.552
Oh, man,
I hate that damn alarm.

01:00.587 --> 01:02.421
It's never a drill, is it?

01:02.455 --> 01:05.491
It's in Ressler/Brooks.

01:05.525 --> 01:07.359
You know what I want.

01:07.394 --> 01:08.527
Use the astrolabe.

01:08.561 --> 01:10.028
- No.
- Undo what you've done.

01:10.063 --> 01:12.398
No, never.
[Boomerang whirs]

01:18.638 --> 01:20.639
You can't kill me.

01:20.673 --> 01:21.940
You need me alive.

01:21.975 --> 01:25.010
True, but I can kill
your friends.

01:25.044 --> 01:27.646
No.
They haven't done anything.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.715
This is between us!

01:33.219 --> 01:34.787
- He's here!
- Hold on, Artie!

01:34.821 --> 01:36.288
We're almost there!

01:36.322 --> 01:39.792
Come here.
I wanna tell you my plan.

01:39.826 --> 01:44.396
[Whispers indistinctly]

01:44.431 --> 01:47.633
No!
[Grunts]

01:50.937 --> 01:51.937
Artie!

01:51.971 --> 01:53.639
- That way.
- Artie, are you okay?

01:53.673 --> 01:55.274
He used DB Copper's ripcord!

01:55.308 --> 01:56.675
- That's how he got in!
- He's gone now.

01:56.709 --> 01:57.776
Are you hurt?

01:57.811 --> 01:59.878
- Should we call Dr. Vanessa?
- No, no!

01:59.913 --> 02:01.980
No, I don't want her
anywhere near this place,

02:02.015 --> 02:03.348
not after what he said to me.

02:03.383 --> 02:04.983
Wha... wait.
Wha... what did he say?

02:05.018 --> 02:06.985
- Pete, the boomerang.
- That's weird.

02:07.020 --> 02:08.186
[Boomerang whirrs]
Why would he say...

02:08.221 --> 02:11.256
Both: Pete!
[Grunts]

02:11.291 --> 02:15.294
He said that he would punish
all of you,

02:15.328 --> 02:17.029
and then he said this time
we wouldn't be able

02:17.063 --> 02:20.766
to stop him.

02:31.878 --> 02:33.312

02:33.346 --> 02:35.013
I've alerted Mrs. Frederic
and the Regents

02:35.048 --> 02:36.014
to this latest breach.

02:36.049 --> 02:37.649
Good, so no more secrets.

No more secrets.
I can't stop him alone.

02:39.285 --> 02:40.786
I'm gonna need all your help.

02:40.820 --> 02:42.187
So Mrs. F is
on her way here?

02:42.222 --> 02:44.022
No, she's with Steve
on a special assignment.

02:44.057 --> 02:45.958
'Cause that always works out
so well.

02:45.992 --> 02:47.359

02:47.393 --> 02:48.894
When Brother Adrian
sent out Alice's mirror,

02:48.928 --> 02:50.662
I grabbed
the shipping account number.

02:50.697 --> 02:52.464
It traced
to a bogus address, obviously,

02:52.499 --> 02:54.867
but I set up a system to notify
me if it got used again.

02:54.901 --> 02:56.835

No, wait, two.

03:02.709 --> 03:04.543
- Yeah.
- Oh, look, there's a third hit.

Menlo Park, California.

03:06.179 --> 03:07.679
Menlo Park?
Who do we know?

03:07.714 --> 03:09.147
We don't know anyone
in Menlo Park.

03:09.182 --> 03:11.350
I do, but I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

03:11.384 --> 03:15.087
Claud, we need to know
who's in danger.

03:15.121 --> 03:17.523
- Joshua.
- Your brother is in Menlo Park?

03:17.557 --> 03:19.525
He's working
on a classified project.

03:19.559 --> 03:21.860
So your brother, your sister,
and my ex-wife.

03:21.895 --> 03:24.563
And that's how he's punishing
you all.

03:24.597 --> 03:26.932
He's going after the ones
you love,

03:26.966 --> 03:28.433
and this is my fault.

03:28.468 --> 03:31.169
No, no, this is
not your fault, Artie, okay?

03:31.204 --> 03:32.971
We can fix this.

03:33.006 --> 03:37.075
Claud, what artifacts
did he send?

03:37.110 --> 03:39.745
I... [Laughs]
I don't believe this.

03:39.779 --> 03:42.214
According to the database,
none are missing... zero.

03:42.248 --> 03:43.215
He must have disabled it.

03:43.249 --> 03:45.951
All right, I gotta go
help Amanda.

I'll stay with Leena.

We'll lock up the breach.

03:52.759 --> 03:55.460
And we will find
the good brother.

04:03.570 --> 04:07.306
I must ask what happened to
the needle on the elevator dial.

04:07.340 --> 04:09.441
Uh, Mrs. Frederic,
uh, you were saying

04:09.475 --> 04:13.111
about the whole...
about our last campaign.

could detect the dent.

Dent?

04:21.353 --> 04:24.222
I'm not the one who dropped it.

04:24.257 --> 04:25.824

04:25.858 --> 04:27.559
about the Brotherhood
of the Black Diamond.

04:27.594 --> 04:28.760

has infiltrated...

04:34.867 --> 04:36.201
Well, it seems to me
the Vatican

04:36.235 --> 04:37.603
is pretty much
at the center of all...

04:37.637 --> 04:40.272
Thank you, Father Domenico.
We'll take it from here.

this is the library.

05:37.864 --> 05:39.831

in a hurry.

they were leaving.

- Ooh!
- [Gasps]

06:16.569 --> 06:18.203
Oh!

06:18.237 --> 06:19.671
- What was that?
- Whoa!

06:19.706 --> 06:21.239
Static electricity, I think.

06:21.274 --> 06:23.008
We just got new
hypoallergenic carpet

06:23.042 --> 06:25.644
installed for the baby,
but that was a big one.

06:25.678 --> 06:28.480
Yeah, your eyes, they...

06:28.514 --> 06:30.182
- Yeah?
- You know what, never mind.

06:30.216 --> 06:31.683
Just let me get a look at you!

06:31.718 --> 06:34.886
You look great.
Is that a new necklace?

06:34.921 --> 06:37.556
Oh, it... it was a gift
from Kevin last Christmas.

06:37.590 --> 06:39.491
Good.
How is Kevin?

06:39.525 --> 06:41.660
In Denver, on business again.

06:41.694 --> 06:43.762
- Good, so he's safe.
- Safe?

06:43.796 --> 06:47.599
From all the crazy sister fun

06:47.633 --> 06:48.600
that we're gonna have!

06:48.634 --> 06:50.102
Aah, I know!

06:50.136 --> 06:52.504
Oh, oh, you have to see
the baby's room.

06:52.538 --> 06:53.705
Good.

06:53.740 --> 06:54.706
- Come on.
- Yeah, okay.

06:54.741 --> 06:56.842
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

07:00.213 --> 07:03.048
[Sighs] Trace, it's beautiful.

07:03.082 --> 07:04.950
Got one or two neat gifts.

07:04.984 --> 07:07.552
Wow!
Wow!

07:07.587 --> 07:10.422
So a lot of new things

07:10.456 --> 07:12.491
have shown up
in your life recently.

07:12.525 --> 07:15.427
Still popular,
just like in high school.

07:19.065 --> 07:20.866
Yeah.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.934
Hey, you want some chai tea?

07:22.969 --> 07:26.171
Sure.
We... we can catch up.

07:26.205 --> 07:30.008
I'll just be here
admiring your gifts!

07:33.713 --> 07:35.447
Check out the sweater set.

07:35.481 --> 07:39.217
It's the cutest thing ever.

07:39.252 --> 07:40.986
- This could be it.
- What?

07:41.020 --> 07:44.489
I said that I, uh...
I love sweater sets!

07:48.895 --> 07:51.296
No.
No, no, no!

07:51.330 --> 07:52.798
What?

07:52.832 --> 07:54.199
I-I can't believe

07:54.233 --> 07:55.967
that it's this cute!
[Teakettle whistles]

07:56.002 --> 07:57.869
Oh, God.

08:01.140 --> 08:05.443
Oh, this tea
has ginger and catnip.

08:05.478 --> 08:07.779
I got it off a website
for pregnant women,

08:07.814 --> 08:10.182
Greenbaby.org.

08:10.216 --> 08:12.317
Everyone said I would be
throwing up

08:12.351 --> 08:14.119
the first three months.

08:14.153 --> 08:15.487
No.

08:15.521 --> 08:18.790
But I haven't even been queasy!

08:20.693 --> 08:22.594
I think it's the catnip.

08:30.069 --> 08:31.436
Oh, I feel awful,

08:31.470 --> 08:32.871
so I'm assuming
that your showing up here

08:32.905 --> 08:33.871
is not a coincidence.

08:33.905 --> 08:36.207
Probably not.
[Chuckles]

08:36.241 --> 08:38.109
Look, I'm sorry, Amanda,
but it looks

08:38.144 --> 08:39.878
like we're dealing
with a little bit more

08:39.912 --> 08:42.246
- of the old, you know...
- Boogedy-boogedy.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.216
Great.
What is it this time?

08:44.250 --> 08:46.151
I'm not really sure,
but are you okay?

08:46.185 --> 08:47.853
[Sighs] I'm feeling worse
by the minute.

08:47.887 --> 08:49.254
[Clears throat]

08:49.288 --> 08:51.990
Yeah, you do look
a little sweaty.

08:52.024 --> 08:53.792
Hmm.
Thank you.

08:53.826 --> 08:57.162
I was going for sweaty.
Hoping for puffy later.

08:57.196 --> 08:59.464
Okay, um, Amanda,
have you received any...

08:59.498 --> 09:03.235
I don't know...
weird packages today?

09:03.269 --> 09:05.470
Yeah, actually, that little
leather box over there

09:05.504 --> 09:06.605
arrived this morning.

09:06.639 --> 09:07.606
There was no return address,

09:07.640 --> 09:08.707
so I assumed
it was from Michael.

09:08.741 --> 09:10.175
He's in Florence now.

09:10.209 --> 09:11.276
And you touched it?

09:11.310 --> 09:13.245
Yes, that is what humans do

09:13.279 --> 09:14.546
when packages are sent to them.

09:14.580 --> 09:16.414
Right.

09:16.449 --> 09:17.649
It made it through
the base's security,

09:17.683 --> 09:18.717
so I figured it was all right.

09:18.751 --> 09:20.051
Was it always empty like this?

09:20.086 --> 09:22.721
Yeah, just the box.

09:22.755 --> 09:25.557
Pete, am I gonna be all right?

09:25.591 --> 09:27.192
Yeah.

09:27.226 --> 09:30.662
I'm here, okay?
We're gonna fix it.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.664
I never really thought of you
as the fix-it guy.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.733
You were always much more
the break-it kinda guy.

09:34.767 --> 09:36.201
I know, right?

09:36.235 --> 09:37.335
I mean, who'd have thought
my life

09:37.370 --> 09:39.437
would get weirder
after I quit drinking?

09:39.472 --> 09:41.573
[Chuckles]

09:41.607 --> 09:43.608
All right, watch your eyes.

09:48.014 --> 09:49.748
Nothing.

09:49.782 --> 09:51.616
Do you... do you feel better?

09:51.651 --> 09:54.019
Oh! [Grunts]
I'll take that as a no.

09:56.355 --> 09:59.557
[Knock at door] Josh?

09:59.592 --> 10:03.094
Joshua?

10:03.129 --> 10:05.630
Josh?

10:05.665 --> 10:06.631
It's Claudia.

10:06.666 --> 10:07.999
I-I keep calling your phone,

10:08.034 --> 10:10.769
but it just keeps...
[Phone vibrates]

10:10.803 --> 10:12.337
ringing.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.277
Oh, crap.

10:27.311 --> 10:28.678
Artie?

10:28.713 --> 10:30.180
Oh, Leena.

10:30.214 --> 10:32.882
Thank God.
I was worried about you.

10:32.917 --> 10:36.186
Artie, what are you doing?

10:36.220 --> 10:37.854
Something that I should have
done weeks ago.

10:37.888 --> 10:40.056
There has to be
some other way to...

10:40.091 --> 10:41.524
There isn't.

10:41.559 --> 10:43.026
No more games.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.728
I won't let him hurt
anybody else.

10:44.762 --> 10:48.098
Next time that I see him,
I'll be ready.

10:48.132 --> 10:49.366
Wait, well, at least let me
just come...

10:49.400 --> 10:52.402
[Farnsworth buzzes]

10:52.436 --> 10:53.536
Leena!
Leena, thank God.

10:53.571 --> 10:56.506
Artie won't answer, and Josh...

10:56.540 --> 10:58.008
Joshua is frozen in some kind

10:58.042 --> 11:00.243
of weird amber-like substance.

11:00.277 --> 11:02.712
What do you think it is?

11:02.747 --> 11:03.813
Amber.

11:03.848 --> 11:05.115
Can you check the database?

11:05.149 --> 11:06.149
On it.

11:06.183 --> 11:09.519
Trailer, go see Artie, go.

11:12.123 --> 11:14.391
[Sighs]

11:14.425 --> 11:17.861
Josh, I'm really, really,
really sorry.

11:17.895 --> 11:19.763
Hey, you remember that one time

11:19.797 --> 11:22.065
when you were stuck
in a different dimension?

11:22.099 --> 11:26.369
This is way better than that,
am I right?

11:26.404 --> 11:28.004
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

11:28.039 --> 11:29.606
All right: Possibilities.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.408
Uh, paleontologist
Georges Cuvier

11:31.442 --> 11:34.244
discovered that species
could go extinct.

11:34.278 --> 11:35.745
Uh, he carried a handkerchief

11:35.780 --> 11:38.281
with a gold embroidered
dragonfly.

11:38.315 --> 11:40.183
Wait, wait, wait.
What's this?

11:40.217 --> 11:42.218
Uh... oh.

11:42.253 --> 11:44.921
No, this is a napkin
with mustard on it

11:44.955 --> 11:46.656
next to food that humans
should not eat.

11:46.690 --> 11:48.792
Or Pliny The Elder
wrote a treatise

11:48.826 --> 11:50.960
theorizing that amber
went from liquid to a solid,

11:50.995 --> 11:52.295
- so it could be a...
- A tiny scroll.

11:52.329 --> 11:53.696
- Yes!
- I found it.

11:53.731 --> 11:55.098
Okay, good.
Neutralize it.

11:55.132 --> 11:56.599
Not that easy.

11:56.634 --> 11:59.202
It's inside the amber.

12:01.639 --> 12:04.140
This tea is going
to make you feel so...

12:04.175 --> 12:07.310
[Gasps]

12:07.344 --> 12:09.179
Oh, my God.

12:09.213 --> 12:11.081
What... what are you doing?

12:11.115 --> 12:13.883
Um, I...

12:13.918 --> 12:16.286
you know, Trace,

12:16.320 --> 12:19.689
this is an anti-fungal spray.

12:19.723 --> 12:21.091
It was created
by the Secret Service.

12:21.125 --> 12:24.494
It detects and exposes mold.

12:24.528 --> 12:26.463
Seriously?

12:26.497 --> 12:27.764
Yes.

12:27.798 --> 12:31.634
Yes, and... and that sweater set
is just covered in mold.

12:31.669 --> 12:33.103
So who's the best aunt ever?

12:33.137 --> 12:36.673
I am.
[Chuckles] Me.

12:36.707 --> 12:40.210
You are.

12:40.244 --> 12:42.212
Sorry I freaked out.

12:42.246 --> 12:45.782
I... hormones.
[Sighs]

12:45.816 --> 12:49.152
Oh, here.
Have your tea.

12:49.186 --> 12:51.054
Okay.

12:51.088 --> 12:53.990
It... [Sniffs]
smells tangy.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.426
That's the catnip.

12:56.460 --> 12:59.863
Drink it fast!
[Laugh] It's yummy.

12:59.897 --> 13:02.332
[Farnsworth buzzes]

13:02.366 --> 13:04.300
Trace, um, you know what?

13:04.335 --> 13:07.470
I have to go take a call,
but I'll be right back, okay?

13:07.505 --> 13:09.339
- Oh, well, take your tea.
- Well, I...

13:09.373 --> 13:10.740
- Oh!
- Oh!

13:10.774 --> 13:13.042
Oh, my God.
Trace, your new carpet.

13:13.077 --> 13:14.210
I'm so sorry.

13:14.245 --> 13:16.346
It... it's okay.

13:18.983 --> 13:21.918
I'll get it.

13:21.952 --> 13:24.721
Just... just take your call.

13:24.755 --> 13:26.756
Go.

13:26.790 --> 13:28.858
Okay.

13:28.893 --> 13:30.827
Mykes, hey.
Are... are you okay?

13:30.861 --> 13:32.629
There is something definitely
wrong with Tracy.

13:32.663 --> 13:34.864
Her eyes are doing
this weird thing,

13:34.899 --> 13:39.035
and... and then she gave me
this... this tea and...

13:39.069 --> 13:41.938
Oh, my God, I think my sister
tried to poison me.

13:41.972 --> 13:45.308
Wow, you said your family
was competitive, but jeez.

13:45.342 --> 13:47.510
No!
It's obviously an artifact.

13:47.545 --> 13:49.379
I just... I have no idea
what I'm looking for.

13:49.413 --> 13:50.813
Same here.

13:50.848 --> 13:52.982
I mean, Amanda was whammied
by something in a leather box,

13:53.017 --> 13:54.150
but I can't find anything.

13:54.185 --> 13:56.519
- Is she okay?
- Well, she's super hot.

13:56.554 --> 13:57.520
Yes, Pete, I've met her,

13:57.555 --> 13:59.222
but if you could just set that
aside for a moment...

13:59.256 --> 14:00.857
What? No.
Wait, no, no, no.

14:00.891 --> 14:02.058
She... she has a fever.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.194
The... the doctors have her
on antibiotics,

14:04.228 --> 14:05.528
and it's not helping.

14:05.563 --> 14:08.998
I don't know, Pete.
Have you tried...

14:09.033 --> 14:12.168
Uh, Pete, Amanda will be fine.

14:12.203 --> 14:14.871
You will figure this out.
I-I have to go, okay?

14:19.410 --> 14:20.510
[Sighs] How is she, doc?

14:20.544 --> 14:22.145
Okay, I'm gonna prep
an ice bath.

14:22.179 --> 14:25.448
She's 106 and rising.

14:25.482 --> 14:29.185
Thank God the bear's Italian.

14:29.220 --> 14:34.123
[Chuckles] What?

14:34.158 --> 14:35.425
Amanda, are you hallucinating?

14:35.459 --> 14:38.494
No.
We were camping, remember?

14:38.529 --> 14:41.097
We heard a bear outside our tent
that ate our dinner.

14:41.131 --> 14:43.800
[Laughs] Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:43.834 --> 14:47.270
Yeah, he, uh... he ate
that whole pot of spaghetti.

14:47.304 --> 14:50.807
And then I said,
"Thank God that bear's Italian."

14:50.841 --> 14:53.176
[Chuckles]

14:53.210 --> 14:57.180
What made you think of that?

14:57.214 --> 14:58.681
I was just thinking how,
even though

14:58.716 --> 15:03.519
you were joking, you were
really scared of that bear.

15:03.554 --> 15:04.654
Yes, I was.

15:04.688 --> 15:06.823
But I wasn't.

15:06.857 --> 15:08.558
No.

15:08.592 --> 15:10.293
You're not afraid of anything.

15:10.327 --> 15:14.897
Pete, I'm scared now.

15:14.932 --> 15:16.966
I know.

15:17.001 --> 15:20.103
Come here.

15:23.540 --> 15:25.775
Oh, my... oh, my God, Amanda,
your back.

15:25.809 --> 15:29.078
What?
Wha... what is it?

15:29.113 --> 15:30.580
Your tattoo.
[Tattoo sizzles]

15:30.614 --> 15:34.050
It... it... it's glowing.

15:34.084 --> 15:35.685
It's on fire,
like it's infected.

15:35.719 --> 15:36.986
Okay, now you're hallucinating.

15:37.021 --> 15:38.921
- I don't have a tattoo.
- Yes, you do.

15:38.956 --> 15:41.291
It's right...

15:41.325 --> 15:42.792
It was just right there.
It was a cat.

15:42.826 --> 15:46.195
Pete, I-I-I feel better.

15:46.230 --> 15:48.865
Like... like a lot better!

15:48.899 --> 15:50.633
Whatever you did
with your hand, it worked.

15:50.668 --> 15:52.101
I didn't do any...

15:52.136 --> 15:54.504
thing.

15:54.538 --> 15:56.472
Whoa!
Ooh!

15:56.507 --> 15:58.508
Oh!
Ooh, no!

15:58.542 --> 16:00.209
Oh.

16:00.244 --> 16:02.345
[Shouts]
Oh, G... oh, my God.

16:02.379 --> 16:03.780
Where is it?
Where is it?

16:03.814 --> 16:05.414
Oh, it stopped, it stopped.
It's on your shoulder.

16:05.449 --> 16:07.250
[Sighs]

16:07.284 --> 16:10.119
It's getting really hot
in here, right?

16:16.789 --> 16:20.859
That static charge that you
felt when you hugged Tracy?

16:20.893 --> 16:22.694
That could have marked
the activation of an artifact.

16:22.728 --> 16:24.863
But she's been in contact
with lots of other people.

16:24.897 --> 16:27.766
It could be sibling-specific.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.402
Okay, so what exactly
am I looking for?

16:30.436 --> 16:33.505
There are dozens
of sibling rivalry artifacts:

16:33.539 --> 16:35.040
Cain and Abel,
Romulus and Remus,

16:35.074 --> 16:36.107
Venus and Serena.

16:36.142 --> 16:37.475
I'll... I'll check.

16:37.510 --> 16:39.878
I don't suppose Cain or Abel
had a white sweater set,

16:39.912 --> 16:40.946
did they?

16:40.980 --> 16:42.347
What?

16:42.381 --> 16:43.815
- Come on.
- Artie?

16:43.850 --> 16:45.350
Error signals.
He's jammed the database again.

16:45.384 --> 16:47.652
Artie, are you there?

16:47.687 --> 16:49.554
Good-bye, Artie.

16:52.024 --> 16:54.326
Uh...

16:54.360 --> 16:55.360
[Farnsworth buzzes]

16:55.394 --> 16:56.728
Ooh.

16:56.762 --> 16:57.896
What, I didn't say good-bye?

16:57.930 --> 17:01.166
Uh, well, "Hello"
would make more sense.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.334
Pete.
Yeah, sorry.

17:02.368 --> 17:04.903
Uh, I'm... I'm just...
you look awful.

17:04.936 --> 17:06.872
Thank you, Artie.

17:06.906 --> 17:10.208
I, uh... I picked up
a stray cat tattoo.

17:10.242 --> 17:12.277
Uh, does that look familiar?

17:12.310 --> 17:14.713
It says <i>"Kotik,"</i>
which is Russian for "Kitten."

17:14.747 --> 17:17.315
<i>Kotik's</i> also the party name
of Ignaty Gryniewietsky.

17:17.349 --> 17:19.217
He was a member
of the people's will

17:19.252 --> 17:20.252
in pre-bolshevik Russia.

17:20.286 --> 17:21.987
And... and do they
call him Kitten

17:22.021 --> 17:23.054
'cause he's cute and cuddly?

17:23.089 --> 17:25.357
He was a terrorist
who assassinated

17:25.391 --> 17:26.724
Tsar Alexander II.

17:26.759 --> 17:28.927
Right,
so the nickname is ironic,

17:28.961 --> 17:30.262
like when Myka
calls me "Einstein."

17:30.296 --> 17:31.529
All right, what did <i>Kotik</i> do?

17:31.564 --> 17:33.198
Well, he and other members,

17:33.232 --> 17:34.933
they filled kerosene cans
with nitroglycerine.

17:34.967 --> 17:35.934
They approached the tsar.

17:35.968 --> 17:37.068
First man detonated.

17:37.103 --> 17:38.603
When the tsar
went to inspect the body,

17:38.638 --> 17:41.373
<i>Kotik</i> just finished the job.

17:41.407 --> 17:42.607
A suicide bomber.

17:42.642 --> 17:44.910
Yeah, many regard him
as history's first.

17:44.944 --> 17:48.313
Okay, great.
So, eventually, I go boom.

17:48.347 --> 17:49.514
How... how do we stop it, Artie?

17:49.548 --> 17:51.549
- We tried goo-ing it...
- No!

17:51.584 --> 17:54.286
Look, uh, just, uh...
you get it off your body.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.854
- Cut it off, if you have to.
- What, what, what?

17:55.888 --> 17:57.322
I-I gotta go.

17:57.356 --> 17:58.623
Really?
Wh...

17:58.658 --> 18:01.192
Trailer, come on.
He's getting away.

18:01.227 --> 18:03.094
[Dog barks]

18:03.129 --> 18:04.896
[Stammering]

18:04.931 --> 18:06.364
Okay, Pete, hold on.

18:06.399 --> 18:07.532
Let me just get a corpsman
in here.

18:07.566 --> 18:08.900
- Maybe they can...
- No, no, no, no, no.

18:08.935 --> 18:11.836
Amanda, no doctor
is gonna cut off a tattoo, okay?

18:11.871 --> 18:12.904
I need you to do this.

18:12.939 --> 18:15.440
Me?
Pete, I don't think I can.

18:15.474 --> 18:17.409
- Aha! Okay.
- No, Pete, I...

18:17.443 --> 18:19.077
- Amanda.
- Mm.

18:19.111 --> 18:20.579
I know there've been
plenty of times

18:20.613 --> 18:22.280
that you've wanted to stick
a knife in me.

18:22.315 --> 18:24.015
This is your chance.

18:24.050 --> 18:25.650
Uh, we should numb it first.

18:25.685 --> 18:26.651
No time.

18:26.686 --> 18:30.188
Aah!

18:30.222 --> 18:31.690
- I can take it.
- Oh, God, okay.

18:31.724 --> 18:35.760
Okay.

18:35.795 --> 18:37.696
- Ah!
- What, what?

18:37.730 --> 18:40.332
- It moved!
- All right, well, keep trying!

18:45.471 --> 18:47.105
- It...
- What, what, what?

18:47.139 --> 18:50.041
It won't let me get near it.

18:50.076 --> 18:53.979
[Groans]

18:54.013 --> 18:58.249
[Alarm sounds]

18:58.284 --> 18:59.317
What the hell is that?

18:59.352 --> 19:03.521
Uh, that is
a radiation detector.

19:03.556 --> 19:06.725
It's all my fault,
'cause I was thinking

19:06.759 --> 19:07.993
it couldn't get any worse.

19:08.027 --> 19:09.427
Okay.

19:09.462 --> 19:12.831
Uh, I realize this may be
a brute force solution

19:12.865 --> 19:15.200
to a delicate problem,
but I don't see

19:15.234 --> 19:16.901
a lot of other choices
here, Josh,

19:16.936 --> 19:18.970
so I'm banking on two things.

19:19.005 --> 19:20.905
One, that the internet's
right about amber,

19:20.940 --> 19:24.442
and, two,
that you won't feel this.

19:36.222 --> 19:37.922
There seems to be no clue
as to what happened

19:37.957 --> 19:39.424
to the brotherhood
organization.

19:39.458 --> 19:41.626
Father Domenico says no one
has seen a single member

19:41.660 --> 19:43.928
either come in or go out
in months.

19:43.963 --> 19:45.630
Vatican knows nothing.

19:45.664 --> 19:49.067
At the risk of invoking
an Abbott and Costello movie,

19:49.101 --> 19:51.436
it could be
that there's some sort of...

19:51.470 --> 19:53.738
- Secret panel.
- Yes.

20:06.218 --> 20:10.088
Agent Jinks?

20:10.122 --> 20:13.558
Did you find the hidden panel?

20:33.379 --> 20:37.982
Tracy?

20:38.017 --> 20:39.484
Trace.

20:39.518 --> 20:41.820
Myka.

20:41.854 --> 20:45.957
Look, you've been affected
by something.

20:45.991 --> 20:48.226
Myka, you're sounding crazy.

20:48.260 --> 20:50.428
I just need you to trust me.

20:50.463 --> 20:51.729
Of course.
[Chuckles]

[Chuckles]

20:53.032 --> 20:54.599
Oh, my God.

20:54.633 --> 20:56.634
What?
What's wrong?

20:56.669 --> 20:58.503
I just felt the baby move
for the first time.

20:58.537 --> 20:59.904
- Oh, my God.
- Oh!

20:59.939 --> 21:01.439
Oh, my God,
you have to feel this!

21:01.474 --> 21:02.774
Okay. Here?

21:02.808 --> 21:04.943
- Yes.
- Okay.

21:04.977 --> 21:06.811
Always so damn perfect.

21:06.846 --> 21:09.881
Not such a smartie now, huh?

21:09.915 --> 21:11.716
- I'm not gonna hurt you, but...
- Aah!

21:11.750 --> 21:13.151
I am a trained
Secret Service agent.

21:13.185 --> 21:14.319
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

21:14.353 --> 21:18.456
Well, I completed
the insanity workout!

21:18.491 --> 21:20.558
[Both grunting]

21:24.396 --> 21:26.564
That was handmade!

21:26.599 --> 21:28.266
[Grunting]

21:28.300 --> 21:30.135
Ow, ow, my hair!

21:30.169 --> 21:31.669
You and your hair.

21:31.704 --> 21:33.571
"I like it curly!
I like it straight!"

21:33.606 --> 21:35.140
Make a decision.

21:37.810 --> 21:39.544
Look, you could never take me
in a fight, okay,

21:39.578 --> 21:41.779
not when you were nine,
not now.

21:44.016 --> 21:45.917
I don't know why
this is happening so fast.

21:45.951 --> 21:48.186
- Okay.
- It's getting worse.

21:48.220 --> 21:50.421
[Grunting]
I feel like the inside

21:50.456 --> 21:51.990
of a microwave popcorn bag.

21:52.024 --> 21:54.926
I just hope this thing
can hold the blast.

21:54.960 --> 21:57.362
It offers explosive mitigation
and radiation shielding

21:57.396 --> 21:59.831
for 2,000 pounds
of TNT equivalent.

21:59.865 --> 22:01.766
- Well, I'm 180.
- Pete.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.001
All right, well, a few more

22:03.035 --> 22:04.269
on my fat days.

22:04.303 --> 22:07.172
[Beeping]

22:07.206 --> 22:10.341
Listen, this cell phone's
not gonna work inside.

22:10.376 --> 22:11.676
You're gonna be all alone
in there, Pete.

22:11.710 --> 22:13.411
I know.

22:13.445 --> 22:16.814
Look, Amanda, if... if there
was any way...

22:16.849 --> 22:19.083
[Grunts] that I could do this

22:19.118 --> 22:21.452
without being the biggest hero
you ever met...

22:21.487 --> 22:24.222
[Grunts]

22:24.256 --> 22:28.059
Far bigger
than your husband Michael,

22:28.093 --> 22:29.961
I'd do it.

22:29.995 --> 22:33.464
[Gasps] Pete.

22:33.499 --> 22:36.267
[Grunts]

22:41.006 --> 22:44.642
Tell them to name something
after me.

22:44.677 --> 22:46.110
Not a mall.
[Chuckles]

22:46.145 --> 22:49.080
[Chuckles] There's that smile.

22:49.114 --> 22:51.649
I'm glad it's the last thing
I'll see.

22:51.684 --> 22:55.553
Pete.

22:55.588 --> 22:58.289
I never stopped loving you.

22:59.592 --> 23:01.826
[Groans]

23:09.468 --> 23:12.971
You were always jealous I had
more friends than you!

23:13.005 --> 23:14.739
Jimmy Quinn only asked you
to the prom

23:14.773 --> 23:15.940
as a favor to me.

23:15.975 --> 23:18.543
Otherwise, your date
would've just been Joel.

23:18.577 --> 23:20.578
- Who's Joel?
- Joel the mole.

23:20.613 --> 23:22.347
That's what we called that thing
on your face!

23:22.381 --> 23:24.349
That was...
that was a beauty mark!

23:24.383 --> 23:26.684
Beauty marks don't have hair.

[Grunts]

23:33.459 --> 23:35.026
Myka, I need to talk to you.

23:35.060 --> 23:37.295
Pete, my sister is so mean.

23:37.329 --> 23:39.397
She had a nickname for my mole.

23:39.431 --> 23:41.899
And I just told you
I had a mole.

23:43.602 --> 23:45.503
It's okay.
I don't care.

23:45.537 --> 23:47.572
Pete, what's wrong?

23:47.606 --> 23:49.507
Is Amanda okay?

23:49.541 --> 23:51.409
Yes.

23:51.443 --> 23:53.678
She's fine.
[Static]

you're glowing.

23:55.948 --> 23:58.249
[Gasping]

23:58.284 --> 24:02.287
That's kinda what
I called you about.

24:02.321 --> 24:03.888
[Panting]

24:03.922 --> 24:07.725
Uh, Myka, I think
this might be the...

24:07.760 --> 24:10.928
I don't see a way out
this time, okay, and I...

24:10.963 --> 24:13.865
[Groans]

24:13.899 --> 24:16.701
I think this might be the end.

[Grunting and wailing]

24:24.430 --> 24:27.265
[Gasps and groans]

24:27.299 --> 24:29.234
Okay, Pete,
just tell me everything.

24:29.268 --> 24:30.735
Okay, okay.

24:30.769 --> 24:35.473
I have a tattoo of a cat
from a Russian suicide bomber

24:35.507 --> 24:39.410
on my back
that's about to explode, okay?

24:39.445 --> 24:42.380
It transfers from skin to skin.

24:42.414 --> 24:44.882
- Did you try...
- You can't burn it off,

24:44.917 --> 24:46.317
cut it off, or goo it off.

24:46.352 --> 24:48.686
Okay, how... how did the tattoo
transfer to Amanda

24:48.721 --> 24:49.921
in the first place?

24:49.955 --> 24:53.858
I don't know.
It's... it's unclear.

24:53.892 --> 24:54.993
It came with this box.

24:55.027 --> 24:56.961
I-I tried to neutralize it,
but it...

24:56.996 --> 24:57.962
[Grunts]

24:57.997 --> 24:59.330
Oh, my God.

24:59.365 --> 25:02.133
Pete, Pete, what if the tattoo
didn't come in the box?

25:02.167 --> 25:03.835
What if it came on the box?

25:03.869 --> 25:05.603
Think about it.
After all, what's leather?

25:05.638 --> 25:08.740
I don't know.
Skin.

25:08.774 --> 25:11.576
Wait, Myka.

25:11.610 --> 25:13.011
Leather... leather is skin!

25:13.045 --> 25:16.347
Right, maybe even the skin
from the suicide bomber.

25:16.382 --> 25:18.149
Eww!

25:18.183 --> 25:20.418
Sometimes this job
can be so gross!

25:20.452 --> 25:23.955
Okay, so if it transferred
to Amanda from the box,

25:23.989 --> 25:26.457
if it transfers skin to skin...

25:26.492 --> 25:28.426
Uh, maybe I can
transfer it back.

25:28.460 --> 25:31.029
Yes, just press the box
against the tattoo.

25:31.063 --> 25:34.966
Okay, okay, okay.

Damn it!

25:42.174 --> 25:43.708
What?
Pete, what's wrong?

25:43.742 --> 25:45.276
I do too many pull-ups.

25:45.311 --> 25:46.878
I should've done yoga.

my last words be

25:52.284 --> 25:53.384
"I should've done yoga."

25:53.419 --> 25:55.153
No, no, just listen to me!

25:55.187 --> 25:59.190
You are not just gonna lie down
and die, okay?

Oh, my God, did you explode?

- At ease!

Do you have a Black Hawk
I could borrow?

27:21.006 --> 27:23.708

to a civilian.

Oh, really?

Not even a civilian
you're still in love with?

- I never said that.
- Yes, you did.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.148
- No, I said...
- No, no, no.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.082
- "I never stopped loving you."
- You can't take it back now.

27:32.117 --> 27:33.117
Totally different thing.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.819
- You can't just go back.
- It doesn't mean anything.

27:34.853 --> 27:36.220
What do you mean
it doesn't mean anything?

27:36.255 --> 27:37.455
It means something to me.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.258
All right, fine, I'll get you
a helicopter, all right?

27:45.397 --> 27:48.232
That looks hot enough.

No, no, no, no.
You're here because... ow!

28:37.416 --> 28:39.016
Something Warehouse-y happened,
didn't it?

28:39.051 --> 28:40.852
No.

28:40.886 --> 28:43.855
Yes, but I saved you, again.

28:57.903 --> 29:00.571
What just happened?

29:00.606 --> 29:03.374
I-I-I was looking
at this painting, and then...

29:03.408 --> 29:06.611
This frame was constructed
by Rembrandt's master framer

29:06.645 --> 29:10.381
who used wood from
the acacia tree of lusaaset.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.450
- The tree of life.
- Very good.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.085
That's how some
of Rembrandt's paintings

29:14.119 --> 29:15.553
are so incredibly lifelike.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.022
So is the brotherhood
in there too?

29:18.056 --> 29:19.524
Brother Adrian must have
trapped them inside

29:19.558 --> 29:20.825
before he left
for the Warehouse.

29:20.859 --> 29:23.294
They should be following you out
one by one.

29:23.328 --> 29:25.162
There's one now.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.200

Keep that handy, Agent Jinks.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.228
Well, not physically,
but... but next Thanksgiving

30:30.262 --> 30:31.596
might be a little problematic.

She's not good.

about the baby.

And the artifact?

30:37.636 --> 30:38.903
I can't find anything.

30:38.937 --> 30:40.338
Well, looks like you went
through everything

30:40.372 --> 30:41.339
but the wrapping paper.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.508
What?
Wrapping paper.

30:43.542 --> 30:44.909
The garbage!

30:44.943 --> 30:48.780
I haven't checked the wrapping
paper in the garbage!

why don't you just kill me?

31:21.780 --> 31:23.281
I'm not a murderer.

31:23.315 --> 31:25.283
But don't worry.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.851
You're never getting out
of here again.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.087
[Dog barks]

31:30.189 --> 31:32.623
So who is Brother Adrian?

31:32.658 --> 31:35.426
[Sighs] Just another
in the long list

31:35.461 --> 31:38.196
of psychos who love artifacts,
I guess.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.098
But how would he know
I was in Menlo Park?

31:40.132 --> 31:42.166
I mean, that was a secret
unless you told someone.

31:42.201 --> 31:43.901
Mm-mmm, not me,

31:43.936 --> 31:46.003
unless you inadvertently...

31:46.038 --> 31:47.672
Uh-uh, Artie was clear.

31:47.706 --> 31:49.340
If I told anyone,
he would personally...

31:49.375 --> 31:50.541
Wait.

31:50.576 --> 31:51.876
Artie knew you were here?

31:51.910 --> 31:54.846
Well, yeah, he set it all up
about two weeks ago.

31:54.880 --> 31:58.583
But that... he acted
like it was a complete surprise,

31:58.617 --> 31:59.784
like he never even knew.

31:59.818 --> 32:01.552
That's weird.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.287
You know, he was kind of abrupt
about the whole thing.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.523
I mean, more than usual.

32:05.557 --> 32:08.659
At first, it didn't even sound
like him.

32:10.562 --> 32:11.929
Okay.

32:11.964 --> 32:13.865
I think I got it all.

32:13.899 --> 32:16.267
All right.

32:16.301 --> 32:19.537
So, um, look for something
that's... that's old-timey

32:19.571 --> 32:21.172
or... or out of place.

32:21.206 --> 32:23.408
Yep.

32:26.311 --> 32:27.712
Hey, Mykes.

32:27.746 --> 32:28.946
What is this?

32:28.981 --> 32:32.083
Uh, that... that is
a, uh, ribbon hat.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.085
It's a dumbass tradition
in... in baby showers.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.987
Yeah, well,
nothing says artifact

32:36.021 --> 32:37.422
like dumbass tradition.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.991
And may I also say...

32:40.025 --> 32:42.960
Hey-hey-hey, huh?
Definitely old-timey.

32:42.995 --> 32:46.197
Also weird and out of place.

32:46.231 --> 32:48.366
Here.

32:50.235 --> 32:52.136
[Whimpers]

32:52.171 --> 32:54.472
- Myka.
- It's not helping.

32:54.506 --> 32:55.840
Okay, so it's a cord, right?

32:55.874 --> 32:57.141
So what else do you do
with a cord?

32:57.176 --> 32:59.277
I don't know.
You unravel a cord.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.447
You... you... you rip a cord.
You... you...

33:02.481 --> 33:04.849
Both: Cut the cord!

33:04.883 --> 33:05.983
- Let's cut it.
- Okay.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.785
Um, all right.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.921
- Ready?
- Yeah.

33:15.894 --> 33:17.195
[Sighs]

33:17.229 --> 33:20.164
Tracy, are you okay?

33:20.199 --> 33:21.699
Myka?

33:21.733 --> 33:24.469
You... you were in the driveway.
But how did you...

33:24.503 --> 33:28.706
Uh, you were...
you passed out, you know?

33:28.740 --> 33:31.676
Pregnancy causes
low blood pressure,

33:31.710 --> 33:36.647
and I read somewhere
that, um, forced limb extensions

33:36.682 --> 33:40.284
can help with, uh...

33:40.319 --> 33:42.186
Your pulse.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.755
- It's back to normal.
- I had the weirdest dream.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.891
Maybe we should call
your doctor.

33:46.925 --> 33:48.593
No.
[Laughs]

33:48.627 --> 33:51.362
No, I-I feel fine, really.

33:51.396 --> 33:52.697
Okay.

33:52.731 --> 33:55.399
It's just so great to see you.

33:55.434 --> 33:57.001
Oh, me too.
[Chuckles]

33:57.035 --> 33:59.237
Hey, your hair looks
really cute like that.

33:59.271 --> 34:00.238
Do you think so?

34:00.272 --> 34:02.306
'Cause I really like it curly,

34:02.341 --> 34:04.791
but maybe I should go back
to the...

34:04.948 --> 34:06.375
You know what, Tracy?

34:06.512 --> 34:08.379
It doesn't matter.
[Chuckles]

34:08.413 --> 34:11.181
[Farnsworth buzzes]

34:11.216 --> 34:12.817
- Hey, Claud.
- Pete, can you talk?

34:12.851 --> 34:14.252
Yeah, yeah, I'm here with Myka.

34:14.286 --> 34:18.054
Tracy's okay, but I'm getting
a really weird vibe.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.056
I think I know why.

34:19.091 --> 34:23.761
Myka, what happened here?

34:23.795 --> 34:27.237
Uh, well, there was a, uh...

34:27.956 --> 34:29.964
windstorm.

34:30.199 --> 34:34.105
But I closed the window
just in time.

34:34.139 --> 34:35.106
Who's the best aunt ever?

34:35.139 --> 34:36.507
Me. I am.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.141
- You are.
- Hey, Mykes!

34:38.176 --> 34:41.245
Just, um...
I'll be right back, okay?

34:43.514 --> 34:45.850
A windstorm?

34:45.884 --> 34:47.985
In Colorado Springs?

34:48.020 --> 34:49.887
Hey, Claud, is Joshua okay?

34:49.922 --> 34:53.757
Yeah, he's fine.
Um, it's Artie.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.626
Pete, he lied to me.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.261
He flat-out lied
about not knowing Joshua

34:57.296 --> 34:58.596
was in Menlo Park.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.464
And have you noticed anything
weird about him today?

35:00.499 --> 35:01.732
Yeah, yeah.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.467
I was having a lot of trouble
with an artifact,

35:03.502 --> 35:05.469
and he just hung up
the Farnsworth.

35:05.504 --> 35:06.537
He totally left me hanging.

35:06.572 --> 35:07.638
He never does that.

35:07.673 --> 35:08.673
Well, he's distracted.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.141
Brother Adrian
is in the Warehouse,

35:10.175 --> 35:12.410
and... and Artie said
that the database is down.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.178
Yeah, except that it's not.

35:14.212 --> 35:15.646
I set up
a remote testing system.

35:15.681 --> 35:18.215
It checks in every few minutes.
I would've gotten the alert.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.951
- Why would Artie say that?
- I don't know.

35:19.985 --> 35:22.219
We need to get back
to the Warehouse right now.

35:24.356 --> 35:27.625
This is how we deal
with the worst of the worst.

35:27.659 --> 35:28.626
You'll fit right in.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.761
Don't do this, Arthur.

35:30.796 --> 35:31.996
You need me.

35:32.030 --> 35:33.431
Like I need cancer.

35:33.465 --> 35:36.634
You are finished attacking me
and the people I care about.

35:36.668 --> 35:39.570
You're making
a terrible decision.

35:39.605 --> 35:42.273
No, I'm making sure
you never hurt us again.

36:06.999 --> 36:08.265
[Dog barking]

36:10.535 --> 36:12.203
Trailer, where's Artie?

36:12.237 --> 36:15.072
Where's Artie, Trailer?
[Dog barks]

36:19.077 --> 36:21.779
Brother Dimitri!
No need to attack.

36:21.813 --> 36:24.115
- They're from the Warehouse.
- What has happened?

36:24.149 --> 36:25.282
You have all been trapped

36:25.317 --> 36:26.684
in that painting
for several months.

36:26.718 --> 36:29.253
A global crisis
forced one of our agents

36:29.287 --> 36:32.490
to use Magellan's astrolabe.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.058
I imagine you know
what that means.

36:34.092 --> 36:36.494
An evil was created.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.162
And that's where you guys
come in.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.398
One of yours has gone rogue
and has been trying to kill us.

36:50.242 --> 36:55.012
[Sighs] It's over.

36:55.047 --> 36:59.016
It's finally over.

36:59.051 --> 37:00.951
It'll never be over.

37:00.986 --> 37:04.488
What?

37:04.523 --> 37:08.492
H-how?

37:08.527 --> 37:11.996
No, no, it can't...
can't be...

37:13.265 --> 37:15.032
Who is it you accuse of turning

37:15.067 --> 37:16.567
against the brotherhood?

37:16.601 --> 37:17.802
Brother Adrian.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.503
- You are lying.
- He tried to kill me.

37:19.538 --> 37:21.338
When? Where?

37:21.373 --> 37:23.507
Two weeks ago in South Dakota.

37:23.542 --> 37:24.675
It is not possible.

37:24.710 --> 37:26.344
I understand
it may be difficult

37:26.378 --> 37:28.145
to believe something like this
is possible...

37:28.180 --> 37:31.248
Mrs. Frederic.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.151
You're a fool.

37:34.186 --> 37:36.887
Oh, God.
That's enough.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.189
That's enough!

37:38.223 --> 37:40.124
Just leave me alone!
Leave my family alone!

37:40.158 --> 37:41.258
Just get out my life!

37:41.293 --> 37:42.727
Not until you use
the astrolabe.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.296
Never!
I'll never do what you want.

37:45.330 --> 37:47.765
And I'll stop you.
I'll stop you, I will.

37:47.799 --> 37:49.500
[Gunshots]

37:49.534 --> 37:52.503
Artie!
What are you doing?

37:52.537 --> 37:54.238
- Leena.
- No!

37:54.272 --> 37:55.606
Don't you touch her!

37:55.640 --> 37:57.074
You leave her alone!
Leena, run.

37:57.109 --> 37:58.509
Get out!

37:58.543 --> 38:00.611
[Laughs]

38:09.187 --> 38:10.621
Something has happened.

38:10.655 --> 38:14.725
Brother Adrian, have you ever
been in South Dakota?

38:14.760 --> 38:16.360
No, I have not.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.966
He's telling the truth.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.868
Then who is at the Warehouse?

38:23.902 --> 38:25.302
[Laughs]

38:25.337 --> 38:27.671
I swear by everything
that I hold dear,

38:27.706 --> 38:31.075
if you touch one hair
on her head, then I'll...

38:31.109 --> 38:33.744
What?
You'll do what?

38:33.779 --> 38:35.913
Artie, stop!
Please stop.

38:35.947 --> 38:37.481
Artie, there's nobody there!

38:37.516 --> 38:39.083
It's just you.
It's just you.

38:39.117 --> 38:40.785
What?

38:40.819 --> 38:42.686
Just me?

38:42.721 --> 38:44.889
No.

38:53.565 --> 38:55.332
Just me?

38:59.351 --> 39:01.319
Just me?

39:01.353 --> 39:02.787
No.

39:02.821 --> 39:04.889
What?

39:04.923 --> 39:07.091
No, no, no, no.

39:07.126 --> 39:09.160
See, he used an artifact.

39:09.194 --> 39:12.430
He used an artifact
to disappear

39:12.464 --> 39:13.965
the instant that you showed up.

39:13.999 --> 39:15.300
No.

39:15.334 --> 39:17.201
No, I've been watching you
for a while, Artie,

39:17.236 --> 39:19.170
and you've been shouting
at the air.

39:19.204 --> 39:21.706
- Stop!
- No! No.

39:21.740 --> 39:23.308
He tried to kill Vanessa

39:23.342 --> 39:25.743
and tried to kill Steve
and Claudia,

39:25.778 --> 39:29.247
and he did all of that just so
that I would use the astrolabe.

39:29.281 --> 39:30.848
Artie, it's going
to be okay, okay?

39:30.883 --> 39:32.650
We're gonna figure this out.
We're gonna figure this out.

39:32.684 --> 39:34.519
No, no, no, no.
[Farnsworth buzzes]

39:34.553 --> 39:38.089
Oh.
[Mumbles]

39:38.123 --> 39:39.757
Leena, where are you?

39:39.792 --> 39:41.526
I'm in the Bronze Sector
with Artie.

39:41.560 --> 39:42.894
Mrs. Frederic, I'm worried.

39:42.928 --> 39:45.229
He's... he's talking
to Brother Adrian, but...

39:45.264 --> 39:48.299
But he's not there, is he?

39:48.334 --> 39:51.235
I am with Brother Adrian now
at the Vatican.

39:51.270 --> 39:53.504
Whatever the effects
of the astrolabe,

39:53.539 --> 39:55.306
I'm afraid it's caused Arthur
to have some sort

39:55.341 --> 39:57.175
of psychotic break.

39:57.209 --> 39:58.910
It would seem
that the Brother Adrian

39:58.944 --> 40:02.380
that Arthur has been battling
never really existed.

40:02.414 --> 40:03.748
It's all in his mind?

40:03.782 --> 40:06.084
A construct
of his subconscious.

40:06.118 --> 40:07.785
I think he's figuring
that out now.

40:07.820 --> 40:09.454
And he... he came to me.

40:09.488 --> 40:10.621
He sat right there!

40:10.656 --> 40:12.623
The astrolabe was
our only solution.

40:12.658 --> 40:14.258
You have to believe me.
I tried to tell you.

40:14.293 --> 40:15.827
And he said
there would be an evil

40:15.861 --> 40:18.029
that I would not be able
to control.

40:18.063 --> 40:21.532
I need your help, Arthur,
in the Warehouse.

40:21.567 --> 40:23.101
How do you know
about the Warehouse?

40:23.135 --> 40:27.205
He sent a mirror to Rapid City.
He sent a mirror to Rapid City.

40:27.239 --> 40:30.208
Hugo!
He... he tried to kill Hugo.

40:30.242 --> 40:31.676
He tried to bury Claudia
and Steve.

40:31.710 --> 40:33.511
They were dead,
and I had to use it!

40:33.545 --> 40:34.946
No!

40:44.556 --> 40:46.357
I...
[Gunshot]

40:46.392 --> 40:48.693
I shot him.
I shot him.

40:48.727 --> 40:50.928
I'm not a murderer.

40:50.955 --> 40:52.346
You're never getting
out of here again.

40:52.401 --> 40:54.465
Yes, I...
And I had him.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.734
I touched him!

40:56.769 --> 40:58.636
He pretended to be me.

No, no, no.

to leave the Warehouse.

41:15.020 --> 41:16.454
Go.

Go now.

[Whimpering]

41:26.131 --> 41:27.932
Let me help you.

41:35.274 --> 41:37.942
The Dark Vault.

It's in the Dark Vault.

Look at me.

Oh, my God.
