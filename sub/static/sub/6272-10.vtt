00:25.088 --> 00:26.723
The study

to stand on her own two feet,

she could walk away.

one we don't encounter often.

as being fired.

can arrange an appointment.

next opening is in three weeks.

But I thought, if you were free
for a drink this evening...

- Fitzhugh: Dr. DePaul--
- Lillian: Lillian.

39:14.676 --> 39:18.645
Fitzhugh: Dr. DePaul, I
don't know what kind of notions

39:18.680 --> 39:20.647
you've picked up
on the fourth floor,

39:20.682 --> 39:23.417

clearer this morning--

you are not to bother
Dr. Langham

39:57.684 --> 39:59.185
about this pregnancy matter.

Virginia:
"Pregnancy matter"?

40:01.287 --> 40:03.723

what it takes

40:03.757 --> 40:06.125
to raise a child
as a single mother?

40:06.159 --> 40:08.594
William: We don't know the first
thing about that woman, Virginia.

40:08.629 --> 40:09.829
Virginia: We know plenty.

40:09.863 --> 40:12.498
We know the diameter
of her areolae.

40:12.532 --> 40:14.700
We know her heart rate

40:14.735 --> 40:17.035
how quickly she moves
into the plateau phase,

- William: Exactly.

What we offer in return
is a simple promise--

40:25.145 --> 40:28.447
a promise to honor their
privacy-- a promise you broke.

40:28.481 --> 40:30.582
Virginia: I did not break
Langham's anonymity.

40:30.617 --> 40:31.617
I gave him a choice.

40:31.651 --> 40:34.352
William:
No, you trapped him, Virginia.

40:34.386 --> 40:36.121
He no longer has a choice,

40:36.155 --> 40:39.257
because he can never unknow
what you told him.

40:39.291 --> 40:41.993
You did this all on your own,
against my wishes.

Your boss sucker-punched me.

41:22.366 --> 41:24.701
Ethan: Thanks, Roberta.

the best gift of his life.

41:31.075 --> 41:32.975
Virginia:
Ethan, what is going on?

41:33.010 --> 41:35.111
Ethan:
Uh, it has to do with Libby,

41:35.145 --> 41:37.514
her blank-shooting
jackass of a husband,

41:37.548 --> 41:41.184

Austin: I remembered
you like to swim at night.

43:18.212 --> 43:21.247
I had to get out
of the hospital.

your bathing suit?

44:35.520 --> 44:39.656
Virginia: Well, that would take
a pretty big mop.

44:43.961 --> 44:48.699
Flora: I'm not fishing for a
husband, if that's what you think.

44:48.733 --> 44:51.568
I didn't even like that guy.

44:51.603 --> 44:53.904
But this kid is half his,

and I thought
maybe I could get to know him.

Thank you.

45:08.886 --> 45:11.888
Virginia: I'm sorry. I can't give
you his name or his information.

45:13.757 --> 45:16.292

Then what is this?

45:16.326 --> 45:19.929
Virginia: Not enough.

45:19.963 --> 45:25.968
It never is.
Trust me, I have two.

45:26.002 --> 45:28.070
But it's better than nothing.

45:28.104 --> 45:31.140
Flora: This is from you?

from the man who's responsible.

I hope I didn't ruin your shot.

I don't suppose
you've read André Bazin,

Jane:
I'm waiting for the movie.

46:16.285 --> 46:18.453

It's pretty theoretical.

Lester:
Honestly, I have no idea.

46:28.062 --> 46:29.363
Jane: You know,

46:29.397 --> 46:32.466
the film you're shooting
won't survive a nuclear attack.

46:32.501 --> 46:34.334
Nothing will.

46:34.369 --> 46:36.636
Except cockroaches.

46:36.670 --> 46:39.339
Lester: And Godzilla.

46:39.374 --> 46:42.075
Jane: They don't tell you this

46:42.110 --> 46:44.611
but I've been reading this book,
"On The Beach"--

46:44.645 --> 46:47.614

global annihilation,

Lester: And if-- if it

48:30.747 --> 48:32.715
for my participation
in our study.

48:34.651 --> 48:36.486
I spent weeks

48:36.520 --> 48:40.990
trying to figure out why
you would treat me that way...

48:41.024 --> 48:46.461

some random volunteer, or worse,

to talk about the baby.

Virginia: That's not why
you didn't tell me.

48:58.674 --> 49:02.611
It's because you felt guilty...

49:02.645 --> 49:07.982
Because you had formed
an attachment to me.

that we that can't let emotions
cloud our judgment,

49:22.965 --> 49:26.067
but you did.

49:28.570 --> 49:34.175
Which means it was...
never really about the research.

49:35.310 --> 49:39.046
No. We were having an affair.

that money is the best way
to handle the problem.

That is a gross violation--

authority. You granted it to me.

50:16.183 --> 50:18.517

a fireable offense.
