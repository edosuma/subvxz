Heather, hey.

01:53.353 --> 01:55.095
You are looking at,
potentially,

01:55.096 --> 01:57.166
the new second assistant
at Pierce London PR.

01:57.266 --> 01:58.465
I thought you were staying
at Brian's tonight.

01:59.559 --> 02:01.025
Well... I decided

02:01.027 --> 02:03.528
to surprise you with
some spicy tuna from Haru.

02:05.564 --> 02:08.316
So, what is all of this?
Oh,

02:08.318 --> 02:09.684
I, uh... I guess
I was just feeling

02:09.686 --> 02:11.352
a little nostalgic.
You know,

02:11.354 --> 02:13.238

Remember how homesick I was?

02:27.387 --> 02:29.471
Yep.

02:29.473 --> 02:31.055
You'd tuck me in every night

02:31.057 --> 02:33.641
and read me bedtime stories
until I fell asleep.

02:35.594 --> 02:38.062
This belongs on the fridge.

Heather...

02:39.649 --> 02:41.516
that last year with Mom--

02:41.518 --> 02:44.569
I was away at college,
but you were home.

02:44.571 --> 02:46.621
Did you notice anything weird?

02:46.623 --> 02:47.772
Define "weird."

02:47.774 --> 02:50.024
Like, were there any new
people in her life?

02:50.026 --> 02:52.777
Did you overhear any
odd conversations?

02:52.779 --> 02:54.746
Okay, this does not
feel nostalgic.

02:54.748 --> 02:56.698
I think I might
have some new

02:56.700 --> 02:58.533
information on Mom's case.
Mom's case

02:58.535 --> 03:01.002
has been closed for nine years.
Yes, but...

03:01.004 --> 03:02.620
you know it never made
any sense to me.

03:02.622 --> 03:04.405
The police
said it was

03:04.407 --> 03:05.707
a carjacking, but...

03:05.709 --> 03:08.126
those guys came at us
like hired killers.

03:08.128 --> 03:10.812
Cat, you also thought
you saw a beast.

Of course. It's you.

04:20.617 --> 04:22.116

04:22.118 --> 04:23.368
You guys don't
have a doorbell,

04:23.370 --> 04:25.119
and I need to
talk to Vincent.

04:25.121 --> 04:26.120
No. You don't.

04:26.122 --> 04:27.288
You need to stay away.

04:27.290 --> 04:28.590
That's what barbed wire means.

04:28.592 --> 04:31.158
JT, I-I found something
of my mom's.

04:31.160 --> 04:34.262
Then put it in a
scrapbook and leave.

04:34.264 --> 04:35.997
No, it's one of her old
research papers.

04:35.999 --> 04:38.216
She was an
infectious diseases doctor.

04:38.218 --> 04:41.019
Every other paper of hers
is about parasites

04:41.021 --> 04:42.103
and viruses.

04:42.105 --> 04:43.304
This?

04:43.306 --> 04:46.224
This is about splicing DNA...
or something.

04:46.226 --> 04:48.309
I-I don't fully understand it,
but I...

04:48.311 --> 04:50.011
No, what you don't fully
understand is that

04:50.013 --> 04:51.779
we have managed to
stay off the grid

04:51.781 --> 04:53.648
for nine years.

04:53.650 --> 04:54.732
Everyone thinks he's dead.

04:54.734 --> 04:57.068
Then you show up,
and people start dying.

04:57.070 --> 04:58.820
People were dying before.

04:58.822 --> 05:00.488
Like my mom.

05:00.490 --> 05:03.374
Vincent was a part of
their DNA-altering experiment.

05:03.376 --> 05:06.527
He's a doctor, he might know
if it's related.

05:06.529 --> 05:08.546
I'm a biochemist.
I say it's not.

05:08.548 --> 05:12.584
JT, please, just...
give this to him.

05:15.672 --> 05:18.089
Chandler.
You brought a cell phone here?

05:18.091 --> 05:21.225
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Why not a flashing neon sign?

05:21.227 --> 05:23.011
"Vincent Keller lives here."

05:26.548 --> 05:28.232
Who are you making yourself
look so pretty for?

05:28.234 --> 05:29.517
And if I said you?

05:29.519 --> 05:32.020
That would be nice,
especially since the other woman

05:32.022 --> 05:33.771
I'm here to see
doesn't have a pulse.

05:33.773 --> 05:35.056
You missed a spot.

05:35.058 --> 05:36.157
Don't you have work to do?

05:36.159 --> 05:38.242
And it's all over your knees.

05:39.228 --> 05:40.612
Will you guys get it
over with already?

05:40.614 --> 05:42.246
And be another notch
on his belt?

05:42.248 --> 05:44.115
Besides, we work together.

05:44.117 --> 05:45.783
And who are you to dish it out,
Miss I'm-on-a-Man-Cleanse?

05:45.785 --> 05:47.251
Just saying,

05:47.253 --> 05:49.704
two of my five brothers met
their wives on the force.

05:49.706 --> 05:51.339
And now how about meeting
your victim?

05:51.341 --> 05:53.374
Love when the boss is
in such a cheery mood.

05:53.376 --> 05:54.709
What do you
want me to say?

05:54.711 --> 05:56.577
"Nice nonregulation
earrings"?

05:56.579 --> 05:58.513
What, we can't go out?

05:58.515 --> 06:00.431
Name's Gemma Parker, age 22,

06:00.433 --> 06:02.016
danced for the Bertrand
Ballet Company.

06:02.018 --> 06:03.351
ID'd her off her cell phone,

06:03.353 --> 06:05.136
which we recovered
along with the body.

06:05.138 --> 06:08.556
The company's housed in the
top floors of this building.

06:08.558 --> 06:10.925
Security?
No cameras, no guards.

06:10.927 --> 06:12.560
Unis are canvassing
for witnesses.

06:12.562 --> 06:14.479
What about the woman
who called it in?

06:14.481 --> 06:16.263
She provided the time
of death, along with

06:16.265 --> 06:18.116
the party of the year
was on 10th Avenue

06:18.118 --> 06:19.033
instead of 10th Street.

06:19.035 --> 06:20.768
Oh, my God.

06:20.770 --> 06:23.037
Oh, my God, Gemma?
Excuse me, Miss.

06:23.039 --> 06:25.039
Oh, my God, what happened?
Wait over here.

06:25.041 --> 06:27.274
I came... I came
to meet her to rehearse.

06:27.276 --> 06:30.128
I'm sorry. You are...?
I'm...

06:30.130 --> 06:32.613
I'm Victoria Hansen.
I'm her understudy.

06:32.615 --> 06:34.048
What?

06:34.050 --> 06:36.117
Did she fall?
We're not sure yet.

06:36.119 --> 06:37.418
Last time you
spoke with her,

06:37.420 --> 06:39.954
did she seem upset or depressed?
I...

06:39.956 --> 06:42.173
I mean...
she was stressed...

06:42.175 --> 06:44.258
She's dancing Odette
in <i>Swan Lake,</i>

06:44.260 --> 06:45.226
It's, like...

06:45.228 --> 06:46.293
the hardest variations
in ballet

06:46.295 --> 06:47.294
and she was struggling,

06:47.296 --> 06:48.763
but...

06:48.765 --> 06:50.064
Why?

06:50.066 --> 06:51.132
You think she jumped?

06:51.134 --> 06:52.984
Excuse me a minute.

06:55.270 --> 06:57.021
Defensive wounds.

06:57.023 --> 06:58.690
Bruises to the face,
cut to the scalp.

06:58.692 --> 07:00.408
So she was fighting
someone off?

07:00.410 --> 07:01.909
Is that what you were doing?

07:01.911 --> 07:03.310
When you were rolling
around in the dirt?

07:03.312 --> 07:05.029
I was not "rolling,"

07:05.031 --> 07:06.414
I tripped.

07:06.416 --> 07:08.149
Look, understudy makes
it sound like

07:08.151 --> 07:10.151
she could've been primed
for suicide.

07:10.153 --> 07:12.253
What do you weigh?
What?

07:12.255 --> 07:15.173
You're probably the same size.
What, a buck two?

07:17.159 --> 07:19.210
Based on the height
of the building

07:19.212 --> 07:21.546
and how far into the street
she landed,

07:21.548 --> 07:23.214
understudy was right
about something.

07:23.216 --> 07:25.183
This was no accident.

07:26.468 --> 07:29.170
<i>Okay, coroner's office</i>
<i>ruled out</i>

07:29.172 --> 07:31.055
accidental death,
so we're looking at a suicide

07:31.057 --> 07:32.724
or homicide.
Perimeter's secure,

07:32.726 --> 07:35.727
so we need to do a sweep of the
building, see what we can find.

07:35.729 --> 07:38.279
Steadman, Grant, you take
the first three floors.

07:38.281 --> 07:39.230
Newman, Moore, next three.

07:39.232 --> 07:42.066
Chandler, Vargas,
theater and above.

07:42.068 --> 07:43.901
Let's go.

07:56.498 --> 07:59.550
Where is that
coming from?

08:16.568 --> 08:19.353
This must be where she was rehearsing.

08:19.355 --> 08:21.272
Music's still on.

08:21.274 --> 08:22.607
Window's open.

08:28.280 --> 08:29.580
Money's still in her wallet.

08:29.582 --> 08:31.999
There's no sign of
a struggle in here.

08:32.001 --> 08:34.202
I'm gonna keep going.

09:16.279 --> 09:17.578
Shh, it's okay, it's okay.

09:17.580 --> 09:18.612
It's okay.

09:18.614 --> 09:21.499
It's okay.

09:21.501 --> 09:23.718
Vincent, what the hell?

09:23.720 --> 09:25.619
I heard you were
looking for me.

09:25.621 --> 09:28.506
Okay, you can't just show up
at my place like that anymore.

09:28.508 --> 09:30.624
Says the guy disturbing
my crime scene.

09:30.626 --> 09:32.009
It's dangerous.

09:32.011 --> 09:35.179
Yeah, and JT might come at
me with a bat again.

09:36.799 --> 09:40.067
I read your mom's paper.

09:40.069 --> 09:41.435
And?

09:41.437 --> 09:45.106
It's about genetic therapy
for dengue fever.

09:45.108 --> 09:47.275
It's got nothing to do with
the experiments they did on me

09:47.277 --> 09:48.559
or her murder.
Then why were those guys

09:48.561 --> 09:50.311
following her?
Were they Muirfield?

09:50.313 --> 09:52.597
Catherine, don't...

09:52.599 --> 09:54.665
Was she working on some
other research for them?

09:54.667 --> 09:55.771
I don't know.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.847
But you told me that
they were tracking her.

09:58.154 --> 09:59.670
Yes, so you would know
it wasn't your fault

09:59.672 --> 10:00.788
and you would stop
pursuing this.

10:00.790 --> 10:02.089
No, but it means

10:02.091 --> 10:03.925
that you know more
than you're telling me.

10:09.097 --> 10:10.765
I know that woman is lying.

10:10.767 --> 10:13.017
What?!

10:13.019 --> 10:15.669
The other dancer
you interviewed.

10:15.671 --> 10:18.823
How long have you been up here?
Her pupils

10:18.825 --> 10:20.341
were dilated, she was sweating,

10:20.343 --> 10:22.977
I could hear her pulse racing.
You could

10:22.979 --> 10:25.646
hear her pulse racing,
from all the way up here?

10:25.648 --> 10:27.815
Yeah.

10:28.817 --> 10:31.285
Okay, well...

10:31.287 --> 10:33.371
maybe her pulse was racing

10:33.373 --> 10:35.740
because she just found
out her friend died.

10:35.742 --> 10:36.700
Just trying to help.

10:36.725 --> 10:38.727
Vincent, I need help
with my mom's case.

10:38.828 --> 10:41.662
No, okay? You are
playing with fire.

10:41.664 --> 10:44.081
These people from Muirfield--
they will not stop

10:44.083 --> 10:47.084
until they've buried me
and anyone who knows about me.

10:47.086 --> 10:50.638
So it did have to
do with Muirfield.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.341
Cat?

11:00.766 --> 11:03.100
Blood, torn leotard.

11:03.102 --> 11:04.685
I don't think
she jumped.

11:04.687 --> 11:06.520
This girl was up here
with someone.

11:06.522 --> 11:09.223
Yeah, she was.

Original Air Date on October 18, 2012

11:13.273 --> 11:17.273
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00ff00>elderman</font> ==

11:21.863 --> 11:22.682
Smoke?

11:22.707 --> 11:23.898
No, thank you,
and from the looks

11:23.899 --> 11:25.733
of Gemma's lungs,
she didn't, either.

11:25.735 --> 11:27.551
Looked like a smoking lounge.

11:27.553 --> 11:29.003
So what was she doing
up there so late?

11:29.005 --> 11:30.037
Taking in the view?

11:30.039 --> 11:31.905
Wasn't exactly a novelty.

11:31.907 --> 11:33.874
She'd been at the company
four years.

11:33.876 --> 11:36.410
Maybe she was with someone
she knew,

11:36.412 --> 11:39.246
and they got into an argument,
which would explain this--

11:39.248 --> 11:41.031
the cut on her scalp.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.533
It matches the end
of this hairpin.

11:43.535 --> 11:45.886
But there are no cells on it,
which means, though,

11:45.888 --> 11:47.588
there has to be another one.

11:47.590 --> 11:48.789
Killer could have taken it.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.224
And she had a powder
on her hands.

11:50.226 --> 11:51.675
Could be makeup?

11:51.677 --> 11:53.777
Missing hairpin and makeup.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.813
Sound like a catfight to you?

11:55.815 --> 11:58.399
<i>Victoria Hansen.</i>

11:58.401 --> 12:00.561
When you talked to her,
did you get her alibi?

12:00.661 --> 12:02.570
She was at home getting ready to
go to the studio,

12:02.571 --> 12:04.071
but no one was with
her to corroborate.

12:04.073 --> 12:05.572
According to the company

12:05.574 --> 12:07.557
Web site, she played
Odette last year.

12:07.559 --> 12:09.109
And now she's the understudy?

12:09.111 --> 12:11.161
Did it seem like
she was lying to you?

12:11.163 --> 12:13.247
Yeah, it always seems
like they're lying.

12:17.852 --> 12:21.255
♪ ♪

12:28.129 --> 12:30.747
So, Victoria has
her old role back?

12:30.749 --> 12:32.749
I begged the board
to postpone the show,

12:32.751 --> 12:35.469
but financially, they said
we just can't take the hit.

12:35.471 --> 12:37.021
Mr. Bertrand,
as Artistic Director,

12:37.023 --> 12:38.939
you obviously
worked closely

12:38.941 --> 12:40.808
with both Gemma
and Victoria.

12:40.810 --> 12:42.559
What was
their relationship like?

12:42.561 --> 12:44.478
Oh, they were like sisters.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.779
Sisters can be competitive.

12:45.781 --> 12:47.097
Especially given
Victoria's demotion.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.148
Demotion?

12:48.150 --> 12:49.783
No, she broke her toe.

12:49.785 --> 12:51.151
It sounds minor.

12:51.153 --> 12:53.103
It's a devastating injury.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.622
She had to leave the city
for almost a year to recover.

12:55.624 --> 12:58.492
It's not so devastating
that she can't dance Odette now.

12:58.494 --> 13:00.461
Look, Victoria didn't have
to kill anyone.

13:00.463 --> 13:01.912
The role was already hers.

13:01.914 --> 13:04.415
We were just waiting
for her to make a full recovery.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.750
Wait. You mean, Gemma was only
a temporary Odette?

13:06.752 --> 13:08.469
That was no secret to anyone,

13:08.471 --> 13:10.971
including both
the girls.

13:10.973 --> 13:12.673
Could there have been
another rivalry between them?

13:12.675 --> 13:14.958
Maybe a boyfriend?
No, neither of them. I would know.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.460
The girls are
here 24/seven,

13:16.462 --> 13:18.462
which is why I was
pushing the board

13:18.464 --> 13:19.930
to pay for a
security system.

13:19.932 --> 13:21.398
Anyone... Thank you.
Thanks.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.016
...can just wander
off the street.

13:23.018 --> 13:25.519
Well, actually, one theory is,
this is someone Gemma knew.

13:25.521 --> 13:29.006
We're gonna need you
to show us her locker.

13:31.659 --> 13:34.194
From the look on
your face, I take it

13:34.196 --> 13:35.829
there's usually
stuff in here.

13:35.831 --> 13:37.664
Overflowing.
I don't understand.

13:37.666 --> 13:39.733
Did anyone else have access?

13:39.735 --> 13:41.118
Not that I'm aware of.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.986
Maybe she gave her combo
to somebody.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.671
Like a sister?

13:47.425 --> 13:50.928
Maybe someone threw
her things out.

14:03.942 --> 14:06.777
They're fresh.
Yeah, the only time I toss

14:06.779 --> 14:09.113
fresh flowers is when they're
from someone I don't like.

14:09.115 --> 14:11.148
Do you feel something powdery?

14:11.150 --> 14:13.066
<i>You're good, Chandler.</i>

14:13.068 --> 14:15.652
Powder on her hands
was lily pollen.

14:15.654 --> 14:17.621
She got flowers
from someone she didn't like

14:17.623 --> 14:19.022
right before she died.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.707
Ex-boyfriend?
Overbearing stage mom?

14:20.709 --> 14:22.192
Her parents live in Ohio,

14:22.194 --> 14:24.495
and so far, no indication
of a boyfriend.

14:24.497 --> 14:25.712
Thanks.

14:25.714 --> 14:27.581
Well, blood work says
she had something.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.550
We found Mifepristone
in her system.

14:29.552 --> 14:31.051
Do you just use big words

14:31.053 --> 14:32.636
to make me feel dumb?

14:32.638 --> 14:34.588
It's a medication,
which, at these low doses,

14:34.590 --> 14:36.140
is used
as the Morning After Pill.

14:36.142 --> 14:37.674
And no, it's to impress you.

14:37.676 --> 14:39.092
Well, what would impress me more

14:39.094 --> 14:42.679
is if you could tell me
how Victoria fits in.

14:42.681 --> 14:44.414
Ah, sticking
with your catfight theory.

14:44.416 --> 14:46.049
Maybe it was, like--
I don't know--

14:46.051 --> 14:47.434
a love triangle gone wrong?

14:47.436 --> 14:49.269
Those never seem
to work out, do they?

15:05.371 --> 15:10.290
♪ I walk on through
these streets every night ♪

15:10.292 --> 15:14.044
♪ Walk through people
who walk too close ♪

15:14.046 --> 15:18.915
♪ Into each other
they're hanging... ♪

15:25.923 --> 15:28.609
I didn't want to
get hit by a bat,

15:28.611 --> 15:32.029
and I'm not here about my mom.

15:32.031 --> 15:34.064
So, working theory is,
secret boyfriend

15:34.066 --> 15:35.949
but they're deli lilies,
so they're untraceable.

15:35.951 --> 15:38.519
You want a drink or something?
No, I want to figure out

15:38.521 --> 15:39.953
how Victoria fits into all this.

15:39.955 --> 15:42.439
Her alibi is weak,
but she has no motive.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.925
Don't you have a partner
to talk to about all this?

15:44.927 --> 15:46.827
You're the one
who said she was lying.

15:46.829 --> 15:48.428
You're the one who said
her pulse was racing

15:48.430 --> 15:50.781
because her friend died.
Okay, so,

15:50.783 --> 15:53.550
is she guilty, or is she just
trying to cover something up?

15:53.552 --> 15:54.918
A lie's a lie, okay?

15:54.920 --> 15:56.253
Just like you say you're
here about your case,

15:56.255 --> 15:57.787
when you're really
just wanting

15:57.789 --> 15:59.956
information about your mom.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.642
What, my pulse is racing, too?

16:01.644 --> 16:04.127
A little.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.930
I swear,
I used to be a normal person.

16:06.932 --> 16:11.018
Well, from where I stand,
you seem pretty normal.

16:11.020 --> 16:13.637
Well, so much
for your super-senses.

16:18.693 --> 16:21.528
I saw this, um...

16:21.530 --> 16:24.581
old photo from camp yesterday.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.667
Couldn't even
recognize myself.

16:26.669 --> 16:29.753
You know, ever since

16:29.755 --> 16:31.872
that day, I...
I can't let it go.

16:31.874 --> 16:33.674
Just the thought

16:33.676 --> 16:38.211
that the people responsible for
killing my mom are out there.

16:57.732 --> 16:59.650
Can't recognize myself, either.

17:02.537 --> 17:04.521
Look at your hair.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.990
Yeah.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.742
Ah.

17:08.743 --> 17:10.594
I thought I heard squealing.

17:10.596 --> 17:11.994
You owe me

17:11.997 --> 17:13.829
$29.99 for this lumbar pack.

17:13.832 --> 17:15.499
Can I, uh...?

17:15.501 --> 17:18.135
Yeah.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.088
I'll be right back.

17:23.641 --> 17:25.709
You were supposed
to deal with this.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.644
It's not about her mom.

17:27.646 --> 17:30.097
Oh, great. So now she's just
dropping by for some chit-chat?

17:30.099 --> 17:31.848
JT, relax.
Relax?

17:31.850 --> 17:33.517
Yeah.
Don't tell me to relax.

17:33.519 --> 17:35.669
I don't tell you to relax.
You were gonna make sure

17:35.671 --> 17:37.421
she never came back here.

17:37.423 --> 17:41.057
And it's not just Muirfield
I'm worried about.

17:41.059 --> 17:42.776
She's not going
to expose us.

17:42.778 --> 17:44.528
I'm talking about you.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.630
You look like you're about
to make her a playlist in there.

17:46.632 --> 17:48.949
Come on, JT. We were
talking about a case.

17:48.951 --> 17:51.201
It doesn't matter
what you were talking about.

17:51.203 --> 17:52.836
You know what happened last time

17:52.838 --> 17:54.971
you were busy
making playlists.

17:54.973 --> 17:57.124
And this would be worse.
She's a cop.

17:57.126 --> 18:00.127
Yeah, okay, well,
this isn't last time.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.935
All good?

18:08.937 --> 18:11.755
Yeah.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.257
So... who are they?

18:16.694 --> 18:19.196
Just guys.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.114
Were they part of... ?

18:21.116 --> 18:24.434
Yeah.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.953
Will you tell me
about them?

18:28.539 --> 18:31.124
Like...

18:31.126 --> 18:33.710
Like this guy-- who is he?

18:36.547 --> 18:38.415
That's Ray.

18:38.417 --> 18:41.551
We used to call
him Pammy Sue.

18:41.553 --> 18:43.804
His girlfriend back home.

18:46.891 --> 18:49.959
He would always
talk about her.

18:49.961 --> 18:51.628
Convinced she was cheating.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.096
Was she?

18:53.098 --> 18:56.349
He never got to find out.

19:00.321 --> 19:04.024
Vincent, you ever thought
about coming forward?

19:04.026 --> 19:05.492
About what Muirfield did?

19:05.494 --> 19:06.860
You're kidding, right?

19:06.862 --> 19:08.779
No, we could investigate them.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.647
No, we are not
investigating anything.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.666
But this photo-- it proves
that it wasn't just you.

19:12.668 --> 19:13.950
Do you not understand yet

19:13.952 --> 19:15.786
what these people
from Muirfield can do?

19:15.788 --> 19:19.155
Okay, but if we did this right,
you could come out of hiding.

19:19.157 --> 19:21.708
You could tell me
what you know about my mom.

19:21.710 --> 19:24.928
And it comes back
to your mother.

19:24.930 --> 19:27.631
Okay, yes, they were
from Muirfield--

19:27.633 --> 19:29.182
the men that were
tracking her.

19:29.184 --> 19:31.668
That is all that I know.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.553
Then we can work together
to get these guys.

19:33.555 --> 19:37.006
I have access to databases,
classified information...

19:37.008 --> 19:39.142
Catherine, I'm a criminal.

19:39.144 --> 19:41.728
You're a victim.

19:41.730 --> 19:45.949
Don't you have some ballerina's
secret boyfriend to track down?

19:45.951 --> 19:47.617
Yeah, maybe focus on that

19:47.619 --> 19:50.804
instead of starting
a whole movement.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.316
So I haven't been

20:32.317 --> 20:33.183
totally honest.

20:33.185 --> 20:35.268
Hey. My man-cleanse.

20:35.270 --> 20:38.404
I was on a date
the other night.

20:38.406 --> 20:40.607
Yeah, your earrings
kind of gave you away.

20:40.609 --> 20:43.276
I just... I can't help it.
I broke the diet.

20:43.278 --> 20:44.911
Well, unlike you,

20:44.913 --> 20:47.247
I cannot find any evidence
that Gemma had a boyfriend.

20:47.249 --> 20:49.115
It's not a boyfriend.

20:49.117 --> 20:50.917
Or why she took
that Morning After Pill.

20:50.919 --> 20:52.585
She dating a platoon?

20:52.587 --> 20:55.154
Um... pop-up.

20:55.156 --> 20:56.706
But I did find something.

20:56.708 --> 20:58.374
Gemma's Facebook page.

20:58.376 --> 21:00.009
In the last six weeks,

21:00.011 --> 21:02.995
there are 22 posts from some
guy named Allen Arabesque.

21:02.997 --> 21:05.131
Arabesque?
That is not a real name.

21:05.133 --> 21:06.549
"You even make drinking
your latte seem graceful."

21:06.551 --> 21:08.334
"You looked smokin'

21:08.336 --> 21:09.519
in those red
jeans today."

21:09.521 --> 21:11.170
God, this guy sounds

21:11.172 --> 21:12.288
like a stalker.

21:12.290 --> 21:14.023
I'd toss flowers
from him, too.

21:14.025 --> 21:15.942
Well, let's talk to I.T.,
see if we can figure out

21:15.944 --> 21:17.527
where this Mr. Arabesque
is posting from.

21:27.204 --> 21:28.471
<i>The IP address</i>

21:28.473 --> 21:31.357
matches the computer at
the Bertrand Ballet Company.

21:31.359 --> 21:32.542
Secret stalker at work?

21:32.544 --> 21:34.327
Well, explains how he knew
her day-to-day so well.

21:34.329 --> 21:35.929
We cross-referenced
everyone's time cards

21:35.931 --> 21:37.330
with those postings.

21:37.332 --> 21:38.915
The only employee
there every time

21:38.917 --> 21:40.216
was Julio Ramirez,

21:40.218 --> 21:41.334
<i>the janitor.</i>

21:41.336 --> 21:42.552
So what's your theory?

21:42.554 --> 21:43.920
He came forward,

21:43.922 --> 21:46.256
confessed his feelings.
Gave her lilies.

21:46.258 --> 21:48.040
She rejected him, he killed her.

21:48.042 --> 21:49.875
He would have had
access to her locker.

21:49.877 --> 21:52.395
Maybe he was looking
for those red jeans.

21:52.397 --> 21:54.097
Sounds like you two

21:54.099 --> 21:55.548
should go find Julio.

22:09.330 --> 22:10.947
Julio wasn't even working
that night.

22:10.949 --> 22:12.615
He has Zumba class on Tuesday.

22:12.617 --> 22:14.417
You sure he went?

22:15.536 --> 22:17.403
I'm not.

22:18.406 --> 22:19.622
Ma, I'm home

22:19.624 --> 22:21.407
and I'm starving.

22:21.409 --> 22:23.543
We're in here, <i>hijo.</i>

22:34.939 --> 22:36.589
Easy, pal.

22:41.946 --> 22:43.479
Hey!

22:43.481 --> 22:45.565
- Move.
- Aah!

22:52.156 --> 22:54.374
I'll take this way.

23:17.898 --> 23:20.516
Where's my picture?

23:21.936 --> 23:23.102
Vincent.

23:23.104 --> 23:24.404
Now, where is it?

23:24.406 --> 23:25.571
I left it in
my office.

23:25.573 --> 23:27.023
I was going to
give it back.

23:27.025 --> 23:28.358
Look, you say
you're a criminal,

23:28.360 --> 23:30.360
but you're a victim,
just like my mom.

23:30.362 --> 23:31.477
That picture is not
about your mother.

23:31.479 --> 23:33.329
No, it's about you

23:33.331 --> 23:35.081
and it's about those
guys in your unit--

23:35.083 --> 23:38.501
Raymond, Matthew, Eric.

23:38.503 --> 23:40.586
I ran it through
facial recognition.

23:40.588 --> 23:42.588
Are you insane?
It is evidence.

23:42.590 --> 23:44.874
Muirfield tracks everything.
Okay...

23:44.876 --> 23:46.042
I have to go.

23:46.044 --> 23:47.543
You think I just want
to show up here,

23:47.545 --> 23:49.379
put you and me both
in jeopardy

23:49.381 --> 23:50.485
if I don't have to?

23:50.510 --> 23:52.510
Vincent, I am trying to
help; that's what I do.

23:52.517 --> 23:56.135
Help who, Catherine--
me, JT?

23:56.137 --> 23:57.887
And those guys in your unit.
Oh, Raymond?

23:57.889 --> 24:00.005
Well, his parents thinks
their son died a hero.

24:00.007 --> 24:01.224
You want to tell them

24:01.226 --> 24:03.359
that they turned him
into a killing machine?

24:03.361 --> 24:04.560
And JT, you know,

24:04.562 --> 24:06.312
he has risked his life
the past decade

24:06.314 --> 24:08.281
trying to hide me
in a warehouse.

24:08.283 --> 24:09.515
You shouldn't have to hide.

24:09.517 --> 24:11.234
That's why we have
to build a case.

24:11.236 --> 24:12.985
I am not one of your cases!

24:12.987 --> 24:15.071
Vincent, this was
a huge injustice.

24:15.572 --> 24:17.407
Stop!

24:37.210 --> 24:40.480
Cat, I've got
the perp.

24:40.482 --> 24:43.048
Sorry.

24:43.050 --> 24:44.067
There you are.

24:44.069 --> 24:45.068
You okay?

24:45.070 --> 24:46.235
You're shaking.

24:46.237 --> 24:48.438
Yeah, just winded.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.264
Julio, we just spoke to the Y.

24:59.266 --> 25:01.299
They confirmed you were
at the 8:15 Zumba class

25:01.301 --> 25:02.934
the night Gemma was murdered.
I told you,

25:02.936 --> 25:04.001
I didn't do anything.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.187
That's not entirely true.

25:06.189 --> 25:07.305
You stole her things,

25:07.307 --> 25:09.440
and I think
you did it

25:09.442 --> 25:12.426
because you cared.

25:12.428 --> 25:14.695
I just wanted something
to remind me of her.

25:16.114 --> 25:18.699
She was the only person
who spoke to me there.

25:18.701 --> 25:20.234
Did you give her
flowers, too?

25:20.236 --> 25:21.319
No.

25:21.321 --> 25:23.237
Julio, you kept
pretty good tabs on Gemma.

25:23.239 --> 25:24.538
Did you see
or hear

25:24.540 --> 25:26.624
anything
that might help us figure out

25:26.626 --> 25:28.159
who did this to her?

25:31.213 --> 25:32.663
I don't know what
it was about,

25:32.665 --> 25:35.349
but, but a few days
before she died,

25:35.351 --> 25:36.968
she went to a
police station.

25:36.970 --> 25:38.285
How do you know?

25:38.287 --> 25:40.304
I followed her.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.006
She seemed upset.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.224
Which precinct?

25:43.226 --> 25:47.228
27th and Chelsea, near
the ballet studio.

25:47.230 --> 25:48.629
<i>Sign-in sheet says</i>

25:48.631 --> 25:50.331
she walks in at 8:40.

25:50.333 --> 25:51.899
There she is.

25:55.654 --> 25:58.189
Is that Victoria?

25:58.191 --> 26:00.441
Ooh, Gemma
does not look

26:00.443 --> 26:01.776
happy to see her.

26:01.778 --> 26:04.662
Gemma never filed
a complaint.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.980
Maybe Victoria's trying
to talk her out of it.

26:08.667 --> 26:11.135
Tess, this is dated
four days ago.

26:11.137 --> 26:13.704
That's the same day Gemma
got the Morning After Pill prescription.

26:13.706 --> 26:15.790
So she had sex
and then went to a precinct.

26:15.792 --> 26:17.174
Sexual assault.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.459
Yeah, we should talk
to that desk clerk,

26:18.461 --> 26:20.177
see if she heard
anything.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.629
Do you mind taking
care of that?

26:21.631 --> 26:23.631
There's something I
need to follow up on.

26:23.633 --> 26:25.683
Yeah, go do
what you have to do.

26:44.202 --> 26:46.404
Hey.

26:49.374 --> 26:52.359
I-I parked far away, I left
all of my electronics at work.

26:52.361 --> 26:54.245
Come on in.

26:54.247 --> 26:56.797
Okay, okay.

26:56.799 --> 26:58.833
I'll... I'll only be
a few minutes.

26:58.835 --> 27:01.034
No worries.

27:02.587 --> 27:04.271
May I get you something--

27:04.273 --> 27:06.674
water, soda,
turkey sandwich?

27:06.676 --> 27:07.875
I think the turkey's
still good.

27:07.877 --> 27:10.678
What's the cut-off--
five days?

27:17.269 --> 27:19.270
What's going on?

27:19.272 --> 27:21.439
The turkey or...?

27:22.324 --> 27:24.775
Oh, you mean this?

27:24.777 --> 27:26.727
Where is everything?

27:26.729 --> 27:28.345
I'm assuming with him.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.865
Which is where?
I have no idea, but wherever it is,

27:30.867 --> 27:33.667
it's safer than here,
where you keep showing up.

27:33.669 --> 27:34.869
Okay, JT, please,
I just need to...

27:34.871 --> 27:36.871
What, see him again?

27:36.873 --> 27:38.873
Look around.

27:38.875 --> 27:40.291
This is not
a subtle hint.

27:40.293 --> 27:41.909
He doesn't want
to see you again.

27:41.911 --> 27:43.794
Not only do I not know
where he is,

27:43.796 --> 27:46.847
I don't even know when
or if he's coming back,

27:46.849 --> 27:50.584
so... see yourself out.

28:01.306 --> 28:02.771
Us again.

28:02.776 --> 28:04.525
You have a minute?
Yeah, of course.

28:04.527 --> 28:06.577
I heard you guys think
this is a murder.

28:06.579 --> 28:08.145
Victoria, did you

28:08.147 --> 28:11.032
and Gemma have any issues or
arguments just before she died?

28:11.034 --> 28:12.984
No.

28:12.986 --> 28:15.653
I mean...

28:15.655 --> 28:17.956
she'd been on me about these
crazy diets I've been on,

28:17.958 --> 28:19.828
and I guess I got defensive.

28:19.829 --> 28:22.963
But when I was out with my toe,
I gained, like, 15 pounds.

28:22.965 --> 28:24.081
And Gemma felt
the need

28:24.083 --> 28:26.000
to report that
to the police?

28:26.002 --> 28:28.703
Or was this
about a sexual assault?

28:30.138 --> 28:32.056
Okay...

28:32.058 --> 28:37.094
look... I don't really know
what happened.

28:37.096 --> 28:38.429
That's why I didn't mention it.

28:38.431 --> 28:39.830
Who's the guy?

28:39.832 --> 28:41.265
I don't know.

28:41.267 --> 28:43.117
When I went to meet her
at the precinct,

28:43.119 --> 28:44.602
she was so emotional,
I could barely understand

28:44.604 --> 28:45.346
a word she was saying.

28:45.347 --> 28:46.797
So you talked her out
of reporting anything?

28:46.822 --> 28:47.823
No.

28:47.824 --> 28:50.574
No, she's the one
who wanted to leave.

28:50.576 --> 28:51.859
And you let her,

28:51.861 --> 28:52.993
knowing what
this was about?

28:57.115 --> 28:58.699
You know,

28:58.701 --> 29:02.036
Gemma got those exact same
flowers the day she died.

29:02.954 --> 29:05.239
Who gave you those?

29:07.075 --> 29:09.093
I don't remember.

29:09.095 --> 29:11.078
We get flowers all the time.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.130
That picture is from,
like, last year.

29:13.132 --> 29:14.415
Were they from Joshua?

29:14.417 --> 29:16.417
Yeah, I just spoke
to the desk clerk

29:16.419 --> 29:18.269
at Precinct 27,

29:18.271 --> 29:20.137
and she didn't hear
anything about pressure,

29:20.139 --> 29:21.722
but she did say
you and Gemma

29:21.724 --> 29:24.024
were arguing about some guy
named Joshua.

29:24.026 --> 29:26.427
I don't know a Joshua.

29:26.429 --> 29:29.897
Desk clerk
must have heard wrong.

29:29.899 --> 29:31.399
All right.

29:31.401 --> 29:33.484
Well, if you remember
things differently,

29:33.486 --> 29:35.069
give us a call.

29:35.071 --> 29:37.271
Yeah.

29:42.295 --> 29:44.378
So I guess
we go back over everything.

29:44.380 --> 29:47.114
Yeah, maybe try to lip-read
the precinct footage,

29:47.116 --> 29:49.250
'cause now she really
seems like she's lying.

29:49.252 --> 29:51.252
Yeah, she does.

29:55.257 --> 29:58.359
Cat, I'm moving
back to Dad's.

29:58.361 --> 30:00.177
What?!

30:00.179 --> 30:01.262
It's just all
this stuff--

30:01.264 --> 30:03.931
the, the board,
the boxes.

30:03.933 --> 30:05.516
I don't want to
remember Mom like that.

30:05.518 --> 30:07.184
I didn't mean
for you to see that.

30:07.186 --> 30:09.103
I'll keep it in my room.

30:09.105 --> 30:11.472
But it-it's
more than that.

30:11.474 --> 30:14.191
After Mom,

30:14.193 --> 30:17.077
I felt kind of like
I lost you, too.

30:27.939 --> 30:28.989
It's work.

30:28.991 --> 30:31.125
Yeah.
I'll just be two seconds, okay?

30:31.127 --> 30:32.326
Chandler.

30:32.328 --> 30:34.512
Detective Chandler,
it's Larry from I.T.

30:34.514 --> 30:36.964
Hi, Larry,
how's my computer looking?

30:36.966 --> 30:38.832
Well, I... I don't know
what you did,

30:38.834 --> 30:40.334
but it triggered
some nasty malware.

30:40.336 --> 30:42.486
The entire hard drive
has been wiped clean.

30:42.488 --> 30:45.022
<i>I ran it</i>
<i>through facial recognition.</i>

30:45.024 --> 30:46.457
<i>Are you insane?</i>

30:46.459 --> 30:47.608
Muirfield tracks everything.

30:47.610 --> 30:49.610
Can we tell where it's from?

30:49.612 --> 30:50.611
I doubt it.

30:50.613 --> 30:52.062
This is
some seriously bad-ass stuff.

30:52.064 --> 30:54.865
This is like the Ebola
of malwares.

30:54.867 --> 30:57.401
You should get in here,
tell me what's important,

30:57.403 --> 30:59.603
I'll see if I can salvage it.

31:26.097 --> 31:27.982
Oh, my God.

31:27.984 --> 31:30.217
Are you okay?
I am so sorry.

32:32.281 --> 32:33.497
Vincent?

32:35.834 --> 32:39.219
It's okay.

32:39.221 --> 32:40.971
I'm okay.

33:00.442 --> 33:03.027
Want me to call the cops?

33:05.364 --> 33:07.715
I am the cops.

33:12.829 --> 33:14.396
Victim shows signs
of lacerations

33:14.398 --> 33:16.398
and subcutaneous
hematoma,

33:16.400 --> 33:18.585
indicating blunt force trauma
to the head and neck.

33:18.621 --> 33:21.855
I jumped out to help him, he came right
at me-- classic mugging scam.

33:21.922 --> 33:25.574
No visible chest
or torso injuries,

33:25.576 --> 33:27.793
no evidence
of clinical fractures.

33:27.795 --> 33:30.746
You were off duty, right?
Yeah.

33:30.748 --> 33:31.997
Oh, he caught you
while your guard was down.

33:31.999 --> 33:33.766
I thought it was up.

33:35.185 --> 33:37.603
And there were
no weapons involved?

33:37.605 --> 33:39.471
No, I used the force necessary
to defend myself.

33:39.473 --> 33:40.806
He fell backwards,

33:40.808 --> 33:43.225
must have hit his head
on the back of the car.

33:46.896 --> 33:50.932
Cortex appears to be lacerated.

33:50.934 --> 33:52.601
Guess that's why

33:52.603 --> 33:54.486
bikers should wear helmets,
even if they are muggers.

33:54.488 --> 33:56.405
Yeah, but

33:56.407 --> 33:58.657
to cause this kind of impact,
for somebody who's a buck two,

33:58.659 --> 34:00.275
you must have
really been working out.

34:00.277 --> 34:01.777
Adrenaline kicked in.

34:03.279 --> 34:06.882
Evan, I obviously didn't mean
for this to happen.

34:06.884 --> 34:09.635
No, of course not.
It's just...

34:11.254 --> 34:13.505
Are you sure that you did this?

34:13.507 --> 34:14.840
Yes.

34:14.842 --> 34:16.725
Why would I lie about it?

34:18.628 --> 34:20.562
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:20.563 --> 34:21.897
You okay?
Mm-hmm.

34:21.899 --> 34:23.799
You sure?
Yes.

34:23.801 --> 34:27.636
Evan... so, what am I telling
Internal Affairs?

34:30.607 --> 34:33.542
That it was self-defense.

34:33.543 --> 34:36.295
<i>I've been thinking about</i>

34:36.297 --> 34:39.815
the lines we cross for
the people we care about.

34:39.817 --> 34:42.167
Like telling a lie,

34:42.168 --> 34:45.170
or going too far,
no matter who else gets hurt.

34:45.172 --> 34:47.873
Who could be that
important to you, Victoria?

34:47.875 --> 34:50.676
A secret boyfriend
named Joshua?

34:50.678 --> 34:52.594
There is no boyfriend
named Joshua.

34:52.596 --> 34:54.830
No boyfriend, but
there is a Joshua.

34:54.831 --> 34:56.264
We remembered
your toe injury.

34:56.266 --> 34:58.333
Most athletes--
they get hurt,

34:58.335 --> 34:59.835
they sit on
the sidelines

34:59.837 --> 35:01.970
and watch,
but you moved away.

35:01.972 --> 35:03.388
For almost a year.

35:03.390 --> 35:05.691
And you gained
15 pounds doing it.

35:05.693 --> 35:08.143
You know, we, um... we
subpoenaed your medical records.

35:08.145 --> 35:10.362
Your doctor wasn't
an orthopedist.

35:10.364 --> 35:12.364
She was an OB.
You were pregnant.

35:12.366 --> 35:14.266
That's who Joshua is.

35:14.268 --> 35:16.184
He's your son.

35:16.186 --> 35:18.487
And those lilies--
you got yours last year,

35:18.489 --> 35:20.739
right around the time
Joshua was conceived.

35:20.741 --> 35:23.492
Gemma got the same ones after
she was sexually assaulted.

35:23.494 --> 35:25.577
That's what the fight in
the precinct was about.

35:25.579 --> 35:27.696
Gemma wanted
to come forward, but...

35:27.698 --> 35:29.832
No, he's a player,
but he's not...

35:29.834 --> 35:33.385
He doesn't have
to force himself on anyone.

35:33.387 --> 35:34.837
Maybe with Gemma, he did.

35:34.839 --> 35:36.538
And maybe

35:36.540 --> 35:40.809
he pushed her off that roof
to keep her quiet.

35:44.714 --> 35:46.982
I didn't want to believe...

35:46.984 --> 35:52.220
After she went to the precinct,
I told him what she was saying.

35:52.222 --> 35:54.072
He swore it wasn't true.

35:55.408 --> 35:57.225
I didn't have a father
growing up.

35:57.227 --> 35:59.578
I didn't want that for Joshua.

35:59.580 --> 36:02.581
I was just trying
to protect my son.

36:04.784 --> 36:06.835
He did it, didn't he?

36:06.837 --> 36:09.838
Who, Victoria?

36:09.840 --> 36:13.425
Who's Joshua's father?

36:15.846 --> 36:19.247
Strong center.

36:19.249 --> 36:21.433
Support.

36:21.435 --> 36:24.419
Soft fingers.

36:24.421 --> 36:27.756
Mr. Bertrand, we need
to speak with you outside.

36:27.758 --> 36:29.558
I'm in the middle
of rehearsal.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.643
We spoke to Victoria Hansen.

36:35.532 --> 36:38.400
Put your hands
behind your back.

36:38.402 --> 36:40.435
This is ridiculous.

36:40.437 --> 36:42.821
We found Gemma's hairpin in the
Dumpster outside your apartment.

36:42.823 --> 36:45.374
Yours and her
DNA are on it.

36:45.376 --> 36:47.960
You're under arrest for the
rape and murder of Gemma Parker.

36:47.962 --> 36:51.547
Anything you say can
and will be used against you...

36:57.470 --> 36:59.671
<i>The thing is,</i>

36:59.673 --> 37:03.625
<i>it's hard to always stay</i>
<i>inside the lines.</i>

37:05.628 --> 37:08.647
<i>So we do the best we can.</i>

37:12.485 --> 37:14.803
Ah.

37:14.805 --> 37:17.489
What, do you have a
tracking device on me now?

37:17.491 --> 37:19.441
Your TA said
you couldn't give a lecture

37:19.443 --> 37:22.995
without your skinny
caramel macchiato.

37:25.815 --> 37:28.784
I wanted to return this.

37:28.786 --> 37:31.336
And if you do see him again,

37:31.338 --> 37:34.623
maybe you could give this
to him, too?

37:40.463 --> 37:43.832
I'm sorry I screwed things up
for you guys.

37:54.844 --> 37:56.678
I didn't realize
you were leaving today.

37:56.680 --> 38:00.198
Figure I get
a jump start on Plan B.

38:00.200 --> 38:04.453
Oh, um, I have
your key for you.

38:06.372 --> 38:08.490
I don't want you
to go.

38:08.492 --> 38:11.460
The boxes, the board--

38:11.462 --> 38:14.413
I shouldn't have
left them out.

38:14.415 --> 38:16.298
She was your mom, too.

38:16.300 --> 38:18.250
It's okay.

38:18.252 --> 38:20.218
No, it's not.

38:20.220 --> 38:22.721
I want to get back
to where we were.

38:22.723 --> 38:23.972
You don't have to.

38:23.974 --> 38:26.642
I am not just
saying it.

38:28.428 --> 38:30.445
Do you have a hickey?

38:31.882 --> 38:34.016
No, no, this is
a work injury.

38:34.018 --> 38:35.951
Oh.

38:35.953 --> 38:37.936
But if it's ever
anything that exciting,

38:37.938 --> 38:40.605
I promise I'll tell you.

38:41.908 --> 38:44.776
Please stay.

38:51.834 --> 38:52.834
I'll go unpack.

38:53.921 --> 38:55.203
Okay.

38:55.205 --> 38:57.422
And next week's sushi is on me.

38:57.424 --> 38:59.074
Twist my arm.
