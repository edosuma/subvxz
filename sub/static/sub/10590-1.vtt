00:29.370 --> 00:31.998
Was it all just a dream?

00:32.173 --> 00:35.336
God bless you, Florida! Thank you!

00:35.510 --> 00:39.241
Did the last four years
not really happen?

00:39.414 --> 00:43.407
Look, there's Ben Affleck.
He's often in my dreams.

00:43.585 --> 00:46.520
And the Taxi Driver guy.
He was there too.

00:46.688 --> 00:49.350
And little Stevie Wonder,
he seemed so happy...

00:49.524 --> 00:52.857
...like a miracle had taken place.

00:53.761 --> 00:55.956
Was it a dream?

00:56.130 --> 00:57.427
We want Gore!

00:57.599 --> 00:59.499
Or was it real?

01:01.569 --> 01:05.061
It was election night 2000, and things
seemed to be going as planned.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.833
In New York, Al Gore is
our projected winner.

01:08.009 --> 01:09.601
The Garden State is green for Gore.

01:09.777 --> 01:14.771
We project Mr. Gore the winner in
Delaware. This state has voted with...

01:14.949 --> 01:17.110
Excuse me, one second.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.583
Mike, I wouldn't do this
if it weren't big.

01:19.754 --> 01:21.847
Florida goes for Al Gore.

01:22.023 --> 01:26.392
CNN announces that we call Florida
in the Al Gore column.

01:27.161 --> 01:30.562
Then something called the Fox News
Channel called the election...

01:30.732 --> 01:32.063
...in favor of the other guy.

01:32.233 --> 01:36.033
Fox News now projects George
W. Bush the winner in Florida...

01:36.204 --> 01:39.640
...and thus it appears the winner of the
presidency of the United States.

01:39.807 --> 01:41.866
All of a sudden, the other
networks said:

01:42.043 --> 01:44.876
"Hey, if Fox said it, it must be true."

01:45.046 --> 01:47.810
All of us at the networks made
a mistake...

01:47.982 --> 01:51.213
...and projected Florida
in the Al Gore column.

01:51.386 --> 01:52.853
It was our mistake.

01:53.021 --> 01:55.819
What most people don't know is
that the man in charge...

01:55.990 --> 01:58.390
...of the decision desk at Fox
that night...

01:58.559 --> 02:00.220
...the man who called it for Bush...

02:00.395 --> 02:03.887
...was none other than Bush's
first cousin John Ellis.

02:04.065 --> 02:07.159
How does someone like Bush get
away with something like this?

02:10.571 --> 02:14.268
Well, first, it helps if your brother is
the governor of the state in question.

02:14.442 --> 02:18.242
You know something? We are gonna
win Florida. Mark my words.

02:18.413 --> 02:19.937
You can write it down.

02:20.114 --> 02:22.275
Second, make sure
your campaign chairman...

02:22.450 --> 02:26.284
...is also the vote-count woman
and that her state hires a company...

02:27.855 --> 02:31.655
...to knock voters off the rolls
who aren't likely to vote for you.

02:31.826 --> 02:35.023
You can usually tell them
by the color of their skin.

02:35.196 --> 02:38.393
Then make sure your side fights
like it's life or death.

02:38.566 --> 02:39.931
This talk about legitimacy
is overblown.

02:42.904 --> 02:44.701
President Bush! President Bush!

02:48.743 --> 02:50.176
And hope the other side
sits by.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.778
And even if numerous independent
investigations...

02:52.947 --> 02:55.006
...prove that Gore got the
most votes...

02:55.183 --> 02:57.743
If there was a statewide recount,
Gore won the election.

02:59.454 --> 03:02.321
...it won't matter, as long as all
your daddy's friends...

03:02.490 --> 03:05.891
...on the Supreme Court vote
the right way.

03:06.060 --> 03:11.088
While I strongly disagree with
the court's decision, I accept it.

03:11.265 --> 03:13.699
What we need now is acceptance.

03:15.303 --> 03:17.737
We have a new president-elect.

03:18.806 --> 03:24.972
It turns out none of this was a dream.
It's what really happened.

03:26.547 --> 03:29.675
On the day the joint session of both
the House of Representatives...

03:29.851 --> 03:33.446
...and the Senate was to certify
the election results...

03:33.621 --> 03:36.385
...AI Gore, in his dual role
as outgoing vice president...

03:36.557 --> 03:38.149
...and president of the Senate...

03:39.827 --> 03:42.887
...presided over the event
that would officially anoint...

03:43.064 --> 03:45.624
...George W. Bush
as the new president.

03:45.800 --> 03:50.533
If any congressman wanted to raise
an objection, the rules insisted...

03:50.705 --> 03:55.506
...that he or she had to have the
signed support of just one senator.

03:56.110 --> 04:00.012
Mr. President, and I take great pride
in calling you that...

04:00.181 --> 04:03.014
...I must object because
of the overwhelming evidence...

04:03.184 --> 04:07.018
...of misconduct, deliberate fraud
and an attempt to suppress voter...

04:07.188 --> 04:11.750
The chair must remind members
that under Section 18 of Title 3...

04:11.926 --> 04:14.952
...United States Code, no debate
is allowed in the joint session.

04:15.129 --> 04:17.529
Thank you, Mr. President.
To answer your question...

04:17.697 --> 04:21.498
...the objection is in writing, signed
by a number of members...

04:21.668 --> 04:25.867
...of the House of Representatives,
but not by a member of the Senate.

04:26.040 --> 04:30.568
Mr. President, it is in writing and
signed by several House colleagues...

04:30.745 --> 04:35.512
...on behalf, and myself, of the 27,000
voters of Duval County...

04:35.683 --> 04:39.244
...in which 16,000 of them are
African-Americans...

04:39.420 --> 04:43.254
...that was disenfranchised
in this last election.

04:43.424 --> 04:45.756
Is the objection signed by a member
of the Senate?

04:45.927 --> 04:48.418
Not signed by a member
of the Senate.

04:48.596 --> 04:50.325
The Senate is missing.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.728
It is in writing and signed
by myself...

04:52.900 --> 04:55.391
...on behalf of many
of the diverse constituents...

04:55.570 --> 04:58.300
...especially those
in the 9th Congressional District...

04:58.472 --> 05:01.532
...and all American voters who
recognize that the Supreme Court...

05:01.709 --> 05:04.610
...not the people of the United States,
decided this election.

05:04.779 --> 05:07.270
Is the objection signed
by a senator?

05:07.448 --> 05:11.612
Unfortunately, Mr. President, it is
not signed by one single senator.

05:11.786 --> 05:15.517
I have no authority
over the United States Senate...

05:15.690 --> 05:17.282
...and no senator has signed.

05:17.458 --> 05:21.019
Mr. President, it is in writing and
signed by myself and several...

05:21.195 --> 05:26.132
...of my constituents from Florida.
A senator is needed, but missing.

05:26.300 --> 05:29.360
Is the objection in writing...

05:29.537 --> 05:32.904
...and signed by a member
of the House and a senator?

05:33.074 --> 05:35.304
The objection is in writing,
and I don't care...

05:35.476 --> 05:40.072
...that it is not signed by a member
of the Senate.

05:40.248 --> 05:43.149
The chair will advise that the rules
do care...

05:43.317 --> 05:48.653
...and the signature of a senator...

05:49.790 --> 05:54.693
Not a single senator came to the aid
of the African-Americans in Congress.

05:54.862 --> 05:59.663
One after another, they were told
to sit down and shut up.

05:59.834 --> 06:02.803
It's a sad day in America,
Mr. President, when we can't find...

06:02.970 --> 06:05.996
...a senator to sign the objections...

06:06.173 --> 06:09.199
- The gentleman will suspend...
- New Democratic senators won't sign.

06:09.377 --> 06:13.177
- I object.
- The gentleman will suspend.

06:15.283 --> 06:17.683
Inauguration coverage, 2001...

06:17.852 --> 06:21.344
...on a nasty, but it could be worse,
kind of day in Washington.

06:21.522 --> 06:23.217
- What do we want?
- Justice!

06:23.391 --> 06:24.756
- When do we want it?
- Now!

06:25.660 --> 06:28.527
On the day George W. Bush was
inaugurated...

06:28.696 --> 06:32.723
...tens of thousands of Americans
poured into the streets of D. C...

06:32.900 --> 06:36.199
...in one last attempt to reclaim
what had been taken from them.

06:40.308 --> 06:43.038
They pelted Bush's limo with eggs...

06:43.210 --> 06:44.905
Stay back! Get back!

06:45.079 --> 06:47.639
...and brought the inauguration
parade to a halt.

06:49.016 --> 06:52.213
The plan to have Bush get out
of the limo for the traditional walk...

06:52.386 --> 06:54.616
...to the White House
was scrapped.

06:54.789 --> 06:59.624
Bush's limo hit the gas to prevent
an even larger riot.

06:59.794 --> 07:04.493
No president had ever witnessed
such a thing on his inauguration day.

07:11.072 --> 07:17.238
And for the next eight months, it didn't
get any better for George W. Bush.

07:17.545 --> 07:21.743
He couldn't get his judges appointed,
he struggled to pass his legislation...

07:23.884 --> 07:26.751
...and he lost Republican control
of the Senate.

07:27.788 --> 07:31.315
His approval ratings in the polls
began to sink.

07:31.492 --> 07:34.928
He was already beginning to look
like a lame-duck president.

07:35.129 --> 07:39.589
With everything going wrong,
he did what any of us would do.

07:39.767 --> 07:42.258
He went on vacation.

07:55.116 --> 07:56.378
Oh, no!

07:56.550 --> 07:59.917
In his first eight months in office
before September 11 th...

08:00.087 --> 08:04.046
...George W. Bush was on vacation,
according to The Washington Post...

08:04.225 --> 08:06.022
...42 percent of the time.

08:06.193 --> 08:09.219
If I hit every shot good, people would
say I wasn't working.

08:09.397 --> 08:13.356
It was not surprising that Mr. Bush
needed some time off.

08:13.534 --> 08:16.094
Being president is a lot of work.

08:16.270 --> 08:19.671
What about these folks that say that
you're taking too long of a vacation?

08:21.242 --> 08:24.473
They don't understand the definition
of work, then.

08:25.479 --> 08:29.882
I'm getting a lot done. You don't
have to be in Washington to work.

08:30.051 --> 08:35.284
It's amazing what can happen
with telephones and faxes.

08:35.456 --> 08:37.447
Thank you so much.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.456
- Is this to Destiny and Bubba?
- Yeah.

08:39.626 --> 08:42.152
What are you doing the rest
of the day?

08:42.328 --> 08:45.264
Karen Hughes is coming over.
We're working on some things.

08:45.433 --> 08:50.700
And she'll be over here. We're working
on a few things, a few matters.

08:50.871 --> 08:55.934
I'm working on some initiatives.
We're... You'll see.

08:56.110 --> 08:58.943
There'll be some decisions
I will have made while I'm here.

08:59.113 --> 09:01.240
We'll be announcing them
as time goes on.

09:01.415 --> 09:05.442
The first time I met him, he had
some good advice for me.

09:05.619 --> 09:07.519
Governor Bush, it's Michael Moore.

09:07.688 --> 09:12.022
Behave yourself, will you?
Go find real work.

09:12.193 --> 09:15.458
And work was something he knew
a lot about.

09:15.629 --> 09:17.688
- Anybody want some grits?
- Yeah.

09:18.232 --> 09:22.259
Relaxing at Camp David.
Yachting off Kennebunkport.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.301
How you doing?

09:25.039 --> 09:28.031
Or being a cowboy on the ranch
in Texas.

09:28.209 --> 09:30.177
I love nature, getting
in the truck with my dogs.

09:31.812 --> 09:33.074
Oh, hi.

09:33.247 --> 09:36.045
George Bush spent the rest
of August at the ranch...

09:36.217 --> 09:38.378
...where life was less complicated.

09:38.552 --> 09:42.044
Armadillos love to dig the soil
looking for bugs.

09:42.223 --> 09:44.214
And...

09:44.658 --> 09:49.027
So I went out there the other day,
and there was Barney...

09:49.196 --> 09:53.656
...buried in this hole,
chasing an armadillo.

09:53.834 --> 09:55.802
It was a summer to remember.

09:56.637 --> 09:59.162
Afterward, he left Texas for
his second-favorite place.

10:01.876 --> 10:04.709
On September 10th, he joined
his brother in Florida...

10:04.879 --> 10:09.009
...where they looked at files
and met important Floridians.

10:09.683 --> 10:15.952
He went to sleep that night in a bed
made with fine French linens.

10:32.940 --> 10:34.703
Do you suppose he's pretty
confident...

10:34.875 --> 10:37.241
...on those numbers on Iraqi
security forces?

12:06.533 --> 12:09.331
Make me look young.

12:20.214 --> 12:23.047
Yeah, I've got a little,
sort of air noise.

12:23.217 --> 12:26.618
Yeah, just don't turn it up too much.
I don't want to blow my head off.

12:33.093 --> 12:35.118
I got a mike here
if they want to use it.

12:35.296 --> 12:38.356
Testing, one, two. This is
the Oval Office. Testing, one, two.

12:38.532 --> 12:41.990
Testing, one, two.
This is the Oval Office.

12:43.804 --> 12:46.864
Testing, one, two, three, four, five.

13:44.598 --> 13:47.123
We have something that has
happened here...

13:47.301 --> 13:50.236
...at the World Trade Center.
We noticed a flame...

13:50.404 --> 13:53.066
...and an awful lot of smoke...

14:00.781 --> 14:02.908
This is horrible.

14:13.694 --> 14:16.128
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

14:16.296 --> 14:18.560
Oh, my, dear.

14:21.468 --> 14:24.767
Let's go! Let's go, back!
Come on, let's go!

14:24.938 --> 14:27.498
Oh, my God!

14:29.476 --> 14:35.745
Save their souls, Lord.
Save their souls, Lord.

14:37.184 --> 14:40.984
Oh, they're jumping.

16:21.688 --> 16:24.316
On September 11 th, 2001,
nearly 3000 people...

16:26.260 --> 16:29.593
...including a colleague of mine,
Bill Weems...

16:29.763 --> 16:34.132
...were killed in the largest foreign
attack ever on American soil.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.733
The targets were the financial
and military headquarters...

16:38.906 --> 16:40.771
...of the United States.

16:40.941 --> 16:46.174
If anyone has any idea or they've seen
him or knows where he is, to call us.

16:46.346 --> 16:50.544
He's got two little babies.
Two little babies.

16:51.151 --> 16:54.052
As the attack took place,
Mr. Bush was on his way...

16:54.221 --> 16:57.054
...to an elementary school
in Florida.

16:57.224 --> 17:00.955
When informed of the first plane
hitting the World Trade Center...

17:01.128 --> 17:04.564
...where terrorists had struck
just eight years prior...

17:04.731 --> 17:08.565
...Mr. Bush decided to go ahead
with his photo opportunity.

17:08.734 --> 17:10.896
- Good morning, boys and girls.
- Good morning.

17:11.070 --> 17:12.834
Good morning.

17:13.773 --> 17:15.638
Read this word the fast way.
Get ready.

17:15.809 --> 17:17.401
- "Mad"!
- Yes. Get ready.

17:17.578 --> 17:21.069
- "Calf"!
- Yeah.

17:21.281 --> 17:24.478
Get ready to read the words on this
page without making a mistake.

17:24.651 --> 17:26.915
When the second plane hit
the tower...

17:27.087 --> 17:29.453
...his chief of staff entered
the classroom...

17:29.623 --> 17:34.788
...and told Mr. Bush,
"The nation is under attack."

17:37.497 --> 17:42.434
Not knowing what to do, with no one
telling him what to do...

17:42.603 --> 17:46.937
...and no Secret Service rushing
in to take him to safety...

17:47.107 --> 17:49.371
...Mr. Bush just sat there...

17:49.543 --> 17:54.845
...and continued to read
My Pet Goat with the children.

18:08.595 --> 18:11.792
Nearly seven minutes passed
with nobody doing anything.

18:17.504 --> 18:20.064
As Bush sat in that Florida
classroom...

18:20.240 --> 18:22.765
...was he wondering if maybe
he should have shown up...

18:22.943 --> 18:24.774
...to work more often?

18:24.945 --> 18:28.210
Should he have held at least one
meeting since taking office...

18:28.382 --> 18:33.342
...to discuss the threat of terrorism
with his head of counterterrorism?

18:35.922 --> 18:40.018
Maybe Bush wondered why he had
cut terrorism funding from the FBI.

18:40.193 --> 18:43.424
Or perhaps he just should have read
the security briefing...

18:43.597 --> 18:46.862
...that was given to him on
August 6th, 2001...

18:47.034 --> 18:49.059
...which said Osama bin Laden
was planning...

18:50.671 --> 18:53.606
...to attack America by hijacking
airplanes.

18:55.842 --> 18:59.369
Maybe he wasn't worried, because
the title of the report was too vague.

18:59.546 --> 19:02.037
I believe the title was
"Bin Laden Determined...

19:02.215 --> 19:04.183
...to Attack Inside the United States."

19:04.851 --> 19:08.446
A report like that might make
some men jump...

19:08.622 --> 19:13.184
...but, as in days past,
George W. just went fishing.

19:13.727 --> 19:19.495
As the minutes went by, George Bush
continued to sit in the classroom.

19:19.666 --> 19:25.127
Was he thinking, "I've been hanging
out with the wrong crowd.

19:27.140 --> 19:30.871
Which one of them screwed me?

19:31.611 --> 19:34.637
Was it the guy my daddy's friends
delivered a lot of weapons to?

19:36.650 --> 19:39.118
Was it that group of religious
fundamentalists...

19:39.286 --> 19:42.278
...who visited my state when
I was governor?

19:44.224 --> 19:47.887
Or was it the Saudis?

19:48.161 --> 19:53.326
Damn. It was them. I think
I better blame it on this guy."

20:00.073 --> 20:02.564
In the days following
September 11 th...

20:02.743 --> 20:05.906
...all commercial and private airline
traffic was grounded.

20:06.079 --> 20:11.312
The FAA has taken the action to close
all of the airports in the United States.

20:11.485 --> 20:14.613
Even grounding the president's
father, former President Bush...

20:14.788 --> 20:16.847
...on a flight forced to land
in Milwaukee.

20:17.023 --> 20:20.481
Thousands of travelers were stranded,
among them Ricky Martin...

20:20.660 --> 20:23.185
...due to appear at tonight's
Latin Grammy Awards.

20:23.363 --> 20:28.801
Not even Ricky Martin could fly.
But really, who wanted to fly?

20:28.969 --> 20:32.837
No one, except the bin Ladens.

20:39.913 --> 20:41.141
We had airplanes pick up...

20:44.551 --> 20:46.678
...Osama bin Laden's family
and other Saudis...

20:46.853 --> 20:48.514
...and transport them out
of the U.S.

20:48.855 --> 20:51.187
The White House approved planes...

20:51.358 --> 20:55.021
...to pick up the bin Ladens
and numerous other Saudis.

20:55.195 --> 20:59.894
At least six private jets and nearly
two dozen commercial planes...

21:00.066 --> 21:01.829
...carried the Saudis
and bin Ladens...

21:02.002 --> 21:05.438
...out of the U.S. after
September 13th.

21:05.605 --> 21:11.339
In all, 142 Saudis, including 24
members of the bin Laden family...

21:11.511 --> 21:14.309
...were allowed to leave
the country.

21:14.981 --> 21:18.041
Osama's always been portrayed
as the black sheep in the family...

21:18.218 --> 21:20.743
...that they cut off all relationship
with him in 1994.

21:23.723 --> 21:25.190
It's more complicated than that.

21:25.358 --> 21:27.758
Osama has had contact with
other family members?

21:27.928 --> 21:32.160
Right. In the summer of 2001, just
before 9l11, one of Osama's sons...

21:32.332 --> 21:35.199
...got married in Afghanistan,
and several family members...

21:35.368 --> 21:37.268
...showed up at the wedding.
- Bin Ladens?

21:37.437 --> 21:41.897
That's right. So they're not cut off
completely. That's an exaggeration.

21:42.075 --> 21:44.270
We now welcome to
Larry King Live...

21:44.444 --> 21:48.346
...Prince Bandar, ambassador of the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the U.S.

21:48.515 --> 21:52.474
You had about 24 members
of bin Laden's family, and...

21:52.652 --> 21:55.450
- Here?
- In America. Students and...

21:55.622 --> 22:00.059
His Majesty felt it's not fair for those
innocent people to be subjected...

22:00.227 --> 22:04.186
...to any harm. On the other hand,
we understood the high emotions...

22:04.364 --> 22:07.925
...so, with coordination with the FBI,
we got them out.

22:08.101 --> 22:11.195
This is retired FBI agent
Jack Cloonan.

22:11.371 --> 22:15.808
Before 9/11, he was a senior agent
on the joint FBl-CIA...

22:15.976 --> 22:17.307
...al Qaeda task force.

22:17.477 --> 22:22.540
I, as an investigator, would not
want these people to have left.

22:22.716 --> 22:26.812
I think, in the case of the bin Laden
family, it would have been prudent...

22:26.987 --> 22:30.445
...to hand the subpoenas out, have
them come in, get on-the-record.

22:30.624 --> 22:31.921
You know, get on-the-record.

22:32.092 --> 22:33.889
- That's the proper procedure?
- Yeah.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.685
How many people were pulled off
airlines after that...

22:36.863 --> 22:39.423
...coming into the country
who were Middle Eastern...

22:39.599 --> 22:41.624
...or they fit a very general picture.

22:41.801 --> 22:45.897
We held hundreds of people
for weeks and months at a time.

22:46.072 --> 22:49.132
Did the authorities do anything when
the bin Ladens tried to leave?

22:49.309 --> 22:51.903
No. They were identified
at the airport.

22:52.078 --> 22:55.878
They looked at their passports,
and they were identified.

22:56.049 --> 22:58.279
That would happen to us
if we left the country.

22:58.451 --> 23:00.419
- Exactly.
- Interview, check the passport.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.145
- What else?
- Nothing.

23:04.190 --> 23:06.317
I don't know about you,
but usually...

23:06.493 --> 23:09.326
...when the police can't find
a murderer...

23:09.596 --> 23:12.463
...don't they usually wanna talk
to the family members...

23:12.632 --> 23:15.795
...to find out where they think
he might be?

23:15.969 --> 23:17.664
You don't know
where your husband is?

23:17.938 --> 23:19.496
If you hear anything,
let us know.

23:19.806 --> 23:21.671
Can you come downtown,
give a statement?

23:21.841 --> 23:23.240
- How long?
- You've got time.

23:23.410 --> 23:25.002
Mine's worth money. Yours isn't.

23:25.178 --> 23:26.907
- Send a bill.
- I asked you a question.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.548
- Answer them. Don't ask them.
- I pay your salary, cop.

23:29.716 --> 23:31.047
Sit down. I'm gonna earn it.

23:31.217 --> 23:34.778
Yeah. That's how cops do it.
What was going on here?

23:34.955 --> 23:36.422
We need to know more about that.

23:38.024 --> 23:40.151
It needs to be the subject
of an investigation.

23:40.327 --> 23:43.728
What happened? How did it happen?
Why? Who authorized it?

23:44.197 --> 23:46.358
lmagine what those poor bastards
were feeling...

23:49.402 --> 23:51.700
...when jumping off that
building to their death.

23:51.871 --> 23:55.534
Those young guys and cops
and firemen...

23:55.709 --> 23:58.405
...that ran into that building,
never asked a question.

23:58.578 --> 24:02.173
And they're dead.
And families' lives are ruined.

24:02.349 --> 24:05.477
- And they'll never have peace.
- That's right.

24:05.652 --> 24:09.247
And if I had to inconvenience...

24:09.756 --> 24:13.886
...a member of the bin Laden family
with a subpoena or a grand jury...

24:14.060 --> 24:16.494
...do you think I'd lose sleep over it?
Not a minute.

24:16.663 --> 24:20.360
No one would question it.
Not even the biggest civil libertarian.

24:20.533 --> 24:22.660
- No, no. It's just...
- No one would question it.

24:22.836 --> 24:25.634
You know, you got a lawyer? Fine.
Counsel? Fine.

24:25.805 --> 24:29.571
Mr. bin Laden, this is why I'm asking.
It isn't because I think you're anything.

24:29.743 --> 24:32.678
I just want to ask you the questions
that I would anybody.

24:32.846 --> 24:35.406
- Right.
- And that's all.

24:35.682 --> 24:37.946
None of this made any sense.

24:38.952 --> 24:43.048
Can you imagine in the days after
the Oklahoma City terrorist bombing...

24:43.223 --> 24:45.453
...President Clinton helping to arrange
a trip...

24:45.625 --> 24:48.423
...out of the country
for the Mc Veigh family?

24:48.595 --> 24:50.460
What would have happened
to Clinton...

24:50.630 --> 24:54.191
...if that had been revealed?
- Burn him! Burn him!

24:54.367 --> 24:56.733
Prince Bandar, do you know
the bin Laden family?

24:56.903 --> 24:58.700
- I do, very well.
- What are they like?

24:58.872 --> 25:02.706
They're really lovely human beings.
He is the only one I never...

25:02.876 --> 25:05.242
I don't know him well,
but I met him only once.

25:05.412 --> 25:07.607
What was the circumstance
under which you met?

25:07.781 --> 25:10.545
This is ironic. In the mid-'80s...

25:10.717 --> 25:12.878
...if you remember,
we and the United States...

25:13.053 --> 25:15.044
...were supporting the mujahideen...

25:15.221 --> 25:18.952
...to liberate Afghanistan
from the Soviets.

25:19.125 --> 25:24.153
He came to thank me for my efforts
to bring the Americans, our friends...

25:24.330 --> 25:27.857
...to help us against the atheists,
the Communists. Isn't it ironic?

25:28.034 --> 25:32.266
He came to thank you for helping
bring America to help him.

25:32.572 --> 25:35.405
And now he may be responsible
for bombing America.

25:35.575 --> 25:38.567
- Absolutely.
- What did you make of him?

25:38.745 --> 25:40.610
- I was not impressed.
- Not impressed?

25:40.780 --> 25:44.580
No. I thought he was a simple
and very quiet guy.

25:46.386 --> 25:51.756
A simple and quiet guy, whose
family just happened to have...

25:51.925 --> 25:57.625
...a business relationship with
the family of George W. Bush.

25:58.031 --> 26:01.057
Is that what he was thinking about?

26:01.768 --> 26:07.104
Because if the public knew this,
it wouldn't look very good.

26:07.874 --> 26:11.173
Was he thinking, "You know...

26:11.344 --> 26:15.610
...I need a big, black marker"?

26:17.250 --> 26:21.516
In early 2004, in a speech during
the New Hampshire primary...

26:21.688 --> 26:24.282
...I called George W. Bush
a deserter...

26:24.457 --> 26:27.517
...from his time
in the Texas Air National Guard.

26:27.694 --> 26:31.892
In response, the White House
released his military records...

26:32.065 --> 26:34.761
...in the hopes of disproving
the charge.

26:34.934 --> 26:38.836
What Bush didn't know is
that I already had a copy...

26:39.005 --> 26:43.772
...of his military records, uncensored,
obtained in the year 2000.

26:43.943 --> 26:47.037
And there is one glaring difference
between the records released...

26:47.213 --> 26:52.412
...in 2000 and those he released
in 2004.

26:54.787 --> 26:58.018
A name had been blacked out.

26:58.191 --> 27:01.991
In 1972, two airmen were suspended
for failing to take...

27:02.162 --> 27:08.567
...their medical examination.
One was George W. Bush.

27:10.970 --> 27:14.098
And the other was James R. Bath.

27:16.209 --> 27:20.145
In 2000, the documents show
both names.

27:20.647 --> 27:27.052
But in 2004, Bush and the White
House had Bath's name blacked out.

27:28.188 --> 27:30.452
Why didn't Bush want the press
and the public...

27:30.623 --> 27:33.751
...to see Bath's name
on his military records?

27:33.927 --> 27:37.363
Perhaps he was worried that the
American people would find out...

27:37.530 --> 27:40.021
...that at one time, James R. Bath...

27:40.200 --> 27:44.398
...was the Texas money manager
for the bin Ladens.

27:45.104 --> 27:47.265
Bush and Bath had become
good friends...

27:47.440 --> 27:50.705
...when they both served in the
Texas Air National Guard.

27:50.877 --> 27:52.344
After they were discharged...

27:52.512 --> 27:55.072
...when Bush's dad was head
of the CIA...

27:55.248 --> 27:59.207
...Bath opened up his own aviation
business after selling a plane...

27:59.385 --> 28:02.752
...to a man by the name
of Salem bin Laden...

28:02.922 --> 28:06.289
...heir to the second-largest fortune
in Saudi Arabia...

28:06.459 --> 28:08.484
...the Saudi Binladin Group.

28:08.661 --> 28:12.654
W. at that time was just starting off
in the world as a businessman.

28:12.832 --> 28:15.699
Because he's a guy who's always
tried to emulate his father...

28:18.271 --> 28:21.832
...he went into the oil business.
He founded an oil company, Arbusto...

28:22.008 --> 28:25.842
...which was very good at drilling dry
holes that nothing came out of.

28:26.012 --> 28:29.504
But the question has always been,
"Where did this money come from?"

28:29.682 --> 28:33.812
Now, his dad was rich. His dad
could have done this for him...

28:33.987 --> 28:36.046
...but his dad didn't do this for him.

28:36.222 --> 28:40.318
There's no indication Daddy wrote a
check to start him off in his company.

28:41.194 --> 28:43.754
So where did George W. Bush
get his money?

28:43.930 --> 28:45.659
I'm George Bush.

28:45.832 --> 28:49.165
One person who did invest in him
was James R. Bath.

28:51.871 --> 28:55.671
Bush's good friend, James Bath,
was hired by the bin Laden family...

28:55.842 --> 28:59.835
...to manage their money in Texas
and invest in businesses.

29:03.916 --> 29:09.752
And James Bath himself, in turn,
invested in George W. Bush.

29:11.624 --> 29:14.354
Bush ran Arbusto into the ground...

29:14.527 --> 29:17.325
...as he did every other company
he was involved in...

29:17.497 --> 29:22.059
...until finally one of his companies
was bought by Harken Energy...

29:22.735 --> 29:25.363
...and they gave him a seat
on their board.

29:25.938 --> 29:29.999
A lot of us suspected through
the years that there has been...

29:30.176 --> 29:32.371
...Saudi oil money involved
in these companies:

29:32.545 --> 29:37.812
Harken, Spectrum 7, Arbusto
Drilling, all the Bush companies.

29:37.984 --> 29:40.976
Whenever they got in trouble,
there were these angel investors...

29:41.154 --> 29:43.088
...who flowed money into
the companies.

29:43.256 --> 29:47.659
The question is, why would Saudis,
who had all the oil in the world...

29:47.827 --> 29:52.594
...go around the globe to invest
in this lousy oil company?

29:52.765 --> 29:56.792
And the thing is, Harken had one
big thing going for it...

29:56.969 --> 30:00.427
...which is that George W. Bush
was on its board of directors...

30:00.606 --> 30:03.769
...at a time when his father was
president of the United States.

30:03.943 --> 30:06.969
When you're the president's son
and you've got unlimited access...

30:08.581 --> 30:11.243
...combined with some credentials
from a prior campaign...

30:11.417 --> 30:15.444
...in Washington, D.C., people tend
to respect that. Access is power.

30:15.621 --> 30:20.217
And I can find my dad and talk
to him any time of the day.

30:20.693 --> 30:23.753
Yes, it helps
to be the president's son...

30:23.930 --> 30:26.057
...especially when you're being
investigated...

30:26.232 --> 30:28.462
...by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

30:28.634 --> 30:31.467
In 1990, when Mr. Bush was
a director of Harken Energy...

30:31.637 --> 30:33.798
...he received this memo
from company lawyers...

30:33.973 --> 30:36.407
...warning directors not to sell stock
if they had...

30:36.576 --> 30:38.806
...unfavorable information about
the company.

30:38.978 --> 30:43.210
One week later, he sold $848,000
worth of Harken stock.

30:43.383 --> 30:47.251
Two months later, Harken announced
losses of more than $23 million.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.886
The James Baker law partner
who helped Bush...

30:50.056 --> 30:52.081
...beat the rap from the SEC...

30:52.258 --> 30:54.920
...was a man by the name
of Robert Jordan...

30:55.094 --> 30:57.790
...who, when George W. became
president...

30:57.964 --> 31:02.230
...was appointed ambassador
to Saudi Arabia.

31:05.371 --> 31:09.705
After the Harken debacle, the friends
of Bush's dad got him a seat...

31:09.876 --> 31:14.210
...on another board, of a company
owned by the Carlyle Group.

31:14.380 --> 31:16.940
We looked at which companies gained
from September 11 th.

31:19.952 --> 31:23.319
We turned up this company, Carlyle
Group, a multinational conglomerate...

31:23.489 --> 31:26.287
...that invests in heavily
government-regulated industries...

31:26.459 --> 31:31.590
...like telecommunications, health care
and particularly, defense.

31:31.764 --> 31:34.699
Both George W. Bush
and George H.W. Bush...

31:34.867 --> 31:38.098
...worked for the Carlyle Group,
the same company that counted...

31:38.271 --> 31:41.001
...the bin Laden family among
its investors.

31:42.008 --> 31:45.136
The Carlyle Group was holding
its annual investor conference...

31:45.311 --> 31:47.108
...on the morning
of September 11 th...

31:47.280 --> 31:49.680
...in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel
in Washington D.C.

31:49.849 --> 31:54.513
At that meeting were
all of the Carlyle regulars...

31:54.687 --> 31:58.145
...James Baker, likely John Major,
definitely George H.W. Bush...

31:58.324 --> 32:00.884
...though he left the morning
of September 11 th.

32:01.060 --> 32:05.019
Shafiq bin Laden, who is
Osama bin Laden's half brother...

32:05.198 --> 32:10.659
...was in town to look after his family's
investments in the Carlyle Group.

32:10.837 --> 32:12.896
All of them together in one room,
watching...

32:13.072 --> 32:16.337
...as the planes hit the towers.

32:16.509 --> 32:18.534
In fact, the bin Laden family
was invested...

32:18.711 --> 32:22.442
...in one of their defense funds,
which ironically meant...

32:22.615 --> 32:28.576
...that as the U.S. increased defense
spending, the bin Laden family...

32:28.754 --> 32:31.985
...stood to gain from those investments
through the Carlyle Group.

32:32.158 --> 32:37.221
Our commander in chief,
President George W. Bush.

32:37.396 --> 32:39.591
With all the weapons companies
it owned...

32:39.765 --> 32:42.495
...the Carlyle Group was, in essence,
the 11 th largest...

32:42.668 --> 32:45.535
...defense contractor
in the United States.

32:45.705 --> 32:49.232
- Thanks a lot.
- It owned United Defense...

32:49.475 --> 32:52.808
...makers of the Bradley armored
fighting vehicle.

32:52.979 --> 32:56.574
September 11 th guaranteed that
United Defense...

32:56.749 --> 32:59.877
...was going to have
a very good year.

33:02.154 --> 33:04.486
Just six weeks after 9/11...

33:04.657 --> 33:07.592
...Carlyle filed to take
United Defense public...

33:07.760 --> 33:09.785
...and made a one-day profit
of $237 million.

33:14.567 --> 33:16.558
But sadly, with so much attention
focused...

33:16.736 --> 33:20.228
...on the bin Laden family being
important Carlyle investors...

33:20.473 --> 33:23.033
...the bin Ladens eventually
had to withdraw.

33:23.209 --> 33:26.144
Bush's dad, though, stayed on
as senior adviser...

33:26.312 --> 33:30.009
...to Carlyle's Asia board
for another two years.

33:30.182 --> 33:36.143
As unseemly as it seems
to know that George H.W. Bush...

33:36.322 --> 33:38.620
...was meeting
with the bin Laden family...

33:38.791 --> 33:45.219
...while Osama was a wanted terrorist,
well before September 11 th...

33:46.399 --> 33:49.926
...it's very discomforting
for Americans to know that.

33:50.102 --> 33:54.766
George H.W. Bush is a man who
has, obviously, incredible reach...

33:54.941 --> 33:56.431
...into the White House.

33:56.909 --> 34:01.972
He receives daily CIA briefings,
which is the right of any ex-president...

34:02.148 --> 34:06.448
...but very few ex-presidents
actually exercise that right. He does.

34:06.619 --> 34:11.112
And, I think, in a very real way they
are benefiting from the confusion...

34:11.290 --> 34:14.521
...that arises when George H.W. Bush
visits Saudi Arabia...

34:14.694 --> 34:18.494
...on behalf of Carlyle
and meets with the royal family...

34:18.664 --> 34:20.996
...and meets
with the bin Laden family.

34:21.167 --> 34:23.897
Is he representing the United States
of America?

34:24.070 --> 34:27.665
Or is he representing an investment
firm in the United States?

34:27.840 --> 34:29.705
Or is he representing both?

34:29.875 --> 34:33.275
This company is about money,
not conspiracies to run the world...

34:33.446 --> 34:37.815
...or engineer political maneuvering
and things like that.

34:37.984 --> 34:41.215
It's about making money,
and it's about making a lot of money.

34:41.387 --> 34:43.786
And they've done very well.

34:44.790 --> 34:47.088
I could get you on-the-record
on this question.

34:49.562 --> 34:52.588
In the White House view,
there is no ethical conflict...

34:52.764 --> 34:57.668
...in former President Bush and
former Secretary of State Jim Baker...

34:57.837 --> 35:00.863
...using their contacts
with world leaders to represent...

35:01.040 --> 35:06.000
...one of the most well-known military
arms dealers, the Carlyle Group?

35:06.178 --> 35:10.877
The president has full faith
that his family will conform...

35:11.050 --> 35:14.918
...with all proper ethics laws
and will act properly in their conduct.

35:15.087 --> 35:19.023
Okay, let's say one group of people,
like the American people...

35:19.191 --> 35:22.456
...pay you $400,000 a year
to be president of the United States.

35:24.196 --> 35:27.688
But then another group of people
invest in you, your friends...

35:27.867 --> 35:32.668
...and their related businesses,
$ 1.4 billion over a number of years.

35:32.838 --> 35:35.568
Who are you gonna like?
Who's your daddy?

35:36.142 --> 35:39.077
That's how much the Saudi royals
and their associates...

35:39.245 --> 35:45.013
...have given the Bush family, their
friends and their related businesses...

35:45.184 --> 35:46.879
...in the past three decades.

35:47.053 --> 35:49.487
Seems like a very nice reunion
with friends.

35:49.655 --> 35:52.249
Is it rude to suggest
that when the Bush family...

35:52.425 --> 35:55.189
...wakes up in the morning,
they might be thinking...

35:55.361 --> 36:00.389
...about what's best for the Saudis
instead of what's best for you or me?

36:00.900 --> 36:04.836
Because 1.4 billion just doesn't buy
a lot of flights out of the country.

36:05.004 --> 36:07.199
It buys a lot of love.

36:59.091 --> 37:01.423
Sooner or later,
this special relationship...

37:01.594 --> 37:04.461
...with a regime that Amnesty
International condemns...

37:04.630 --> 37:07.155
...as a widespread human-rights
violator...

37:07.333 --> 37:09.096
...would come back to haunt
the Bushes.

37:11.137 --> 37:13.105
Now, after 9/11, it was
an embarrassment.

37:13.272 --> 37:16.799
And they preferred that no one
ask any questions.

37:16.976 --> 37:19.240
Investigation should have begun
on September 12th.

37:21.113 --> 37:23.946
There's no reason it shouldn't have.
Three thousand were dead.

37:24.116 --> 37:26.641
It should've gotten started
immediately.

37:26.819 --> 37:29.219
First, Bush tried to stop Congress
from setting up...

37:30.923 --> 37:34.359
...its own 9/11 investigation.
- It's important for us...

37:35.161 --> 37:37.493
...to not reveal how
we collect information.

37:37.663 --> 37:40.791
That's what the enemy wants.
And we're fighting an enemy.

37:40.966 --> 37:43.901
When he couldn't stop Congress,
he then tried to stop...

37:44.069 --> 37:47.129
...an independent 9/11 commission
from being formed.

37:47.306 --> 37:49.570
The president's position was a break
from history.

37:49.742 --> 37:52.677
Independent investigations were
launched after Pearl Harbor...

37:52.845 --> 37:54.710
...and President Kennedy's
assassination.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.747
But when Congress did complete
its own investigation...

37:57.917 --> 38:01.080
...the Bush White House
censored 28 pages of the report.

38:01.253 --> 38:05.121
The president is being pressed
by all sides to declassify the report.

38:05.291 --> 38:08.226
U.S. officials tell NBC News
most of the secret sources...

38:08.394 --> 38:10.055
...involve Saudi Arabia.

38:10.229 --> 38:15.929
We've given extraordinary cooperation
with Chairmen Kean and Hamilton.

38:16.101 --> 38:18.092
We haven't gotten the materials
we needed...

38:19.805 --> 38:21.932
...and haven't gotten them
in a timely fashion.

38:22.107 --> 38:24.098
Will you testify
before the commission?

38:24.276 --> 38:28.610
This commission? You know, I don't...
Testify? I'd be glad to visit with them.

38:28.781 --> 38:32.342
What it will do is, the hole
that's in my heart...

38:32.518 --> 38:34.850
...and has been in my heart
since September 11 th...

38:36.856 --> 38:42.522
I lost my husband of 15 years.
I am now by myself.

38:44.063 --> 38:47.032
I need to know what happened
to him.

38:47.766 --> 38:53.261
I know what I got back
from the autopsy.

38:53.439 --> 38:58.001
That man was my life,
and I have no plan.

38:58.177 --> 39:01.078
I was taking a class,
and they asked me...

39:01.247 --> 39:03.681
...what was I gonna do in the next
five years.

39:03.849 --> 39:07.444
And if I'm not doing something
with this, I don't know what reason...

39:07.620 --> 39:11.249
...I have to live.
So it's very important.

39:12.057 --> 39:15.549
Very important. Okay.

39:16.195 --> 39:17.719
Okay.

39:19.131 --> 39:21.224
Ignored by the Bush administration...

39:21.400 --> 39:24.426
...more than 500 relatives
of 9/11 victims...

39:24.603 --> 39:27.868
...filed suit against Saudi royals
and others.

39:28.040 --> 39:30.474
The lawyers the Saudi
defense minister hired...

39:30.643 --> 39:32.611
...to fight the 9/11 families?

39:32.778 --> 39:38.216
The law firm of Bush family confidant,
James A. Baker.

39:38.384 --> 39:41.945
So right here in the center of three
important American landmarks...

39:42.121 --> 39:45.648
...the Watergate Hotel
and office building...

39:45.824 --> 39:48.190
...the Kennedy Center over there...

39:48.360 --> 39:52.854
...and the embassy of Saudi Arabia.

39:53.198 --> 39:54.460
Yeah.

39:54.633 --> 39:58.262
How much money do the Saudis
have invested in America, roughly?

39:58.437 --> 40:02.339
I've heard figures as high
as $860 billion.

40:02.508 --> 40:05.500
- Eight hundred and sixty billion?
- Billion.

40:05.678 --> 40:08.112
- That's a lot of money.
- A lot, yeah.

40:08.280 --> 40:12.876
And what percentage of our economy
does that represent?

40:13.052 --> 40:14.314
It seems like a lot.

40:14.486 --> 40:18.286
Well, in terms of investments
on Wall Street in American equities...

40:18.457 --> 40:22.120
...it's roughly 6 or 7 percent
of America.

40:22.294 --> 40:24.819
They own a fairly good slice
of America.

40:24.997 --> 40:28.057
Most of that money goes into
the great blue-chip companies.

40:28.233 --> 40:32.169
Citigroup, Citibank,
the largest stockholder is a Saudi.

40:32.338 --> 40:36.001
AOL-Time Warner has
big Saudi investors.

40:36.175 --> 40:39.303
So I read where, like, the Saudis have
a trillion dollars...

40:39.478 --> 40:42.470
...in our banks of their money.
What would happen...

40:42.648 --> 40:44.616
...if they pulled that trillion out?

40:44.783 --> 40:48.310
A trillion dollars? That would be
an enormous blow to the economy.

40:49.088 --> 40:51.318
Can I speak to you for a moment,
please, sir?

40:51.490 --> 40:53.924
- How are you doing?
- Good, how you doing?

40:54.093 --> 40:58.086
Steve Kimball with the Secret Service.
We're just ascertaining information.

40:58.263 --> 41:01.232
Are you doing a documentary
on the Saudi Arabian Embassy?

41:01.400 --> 41:05.427
No. I am doing a documentary,
and part of it is about Saudi Arabia.

41:05.604 --> 41:08.266
Even though we were nowhere near
the White House...

41:08.440 --> 41:12.171
...the Secret Service had shown up
to ask us what we were doing...

41:12.344 --> 41:14.744
...standing across the street
from the Saudi Embassy.

41:14.913 --> 41:17.575
- We're not here to cause any trouble.
- Okay.

41:18.217 --> 41:20.310
- You know. Is that...?
- No, that's fine.

41:20.486 --> 41:23.512
We just wanted to get
some information as far as...

41:23.689 --> 41:25.122
What's going on, yeah.

41:25.290 --> 41:28.487
I didn't realize the Secret Service
guards foreign embassies.

41:28.660 --> 41:31.652
- Not usually, no, sir.
- No. Do they give you any trouble?

41:31.830 --> 41:34.822
- Saudis?
- No comment on that.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.797
Okay, I'll take that as a yes.

41:36.969 --> 41:38.334
Good. Thank you very much.

41:38.504 --> 41:41.166
It turns out that Saudi Prince Bandar
is perhaps...

41:41.340 --> 41:43.604
...the best-protected ambassador
in the U.S.

41:43.776 --> 41:47.906
The U.S. State Department provides
him with a six-man security detail.

41:48.080 --> 41:51.015
Considering how he and his family
and the Saudi elite...

41:51.183 --> 41:56.280
...own 7 percent of America,
it's probably not a bad idea.

41:57.723 --> 41:59.953
Prince Bandar was so close
to the Bushes...

42:00.125 --> 42:02.525
...they considered him a member
of the family.

42:02.694 --> 42:05.993
They even had a nickname for him:
Bandar Bush.

42:06.165 --> 42:10.534
Two nights after September 11 th,
George Bush invited Bandar Bush...

42:10.702 --> 42:14.832
...over to the White House
for a private dinner and a talk.

42:15.007 --> 42:17.635
Even though bin Laden
was a Saudi...

42:17.810 --> 42:20.643
...and Saudi money
had funded al Qaeda...

42:20.813 --> 42:24.442
...and 15 of the 19 hijackers
were Saudis...

42:24.716 --> 42:28.447
...here was the Saudi ambassador,
casually dining with the president...

42:28.620 --> 42:31.020
...on September 13th.

42:31.690 --> 42:34.352
What were they talking about?

42:34.526 --> 42:38.656
Were they commiserating
or comparing notes?

42:39.798 --> 42:41.857
Why would Bandar's government...

42:42.334 --> 42:45.667
...block American investigators
from talking to the relatives...

42:45.838 --> 42:48.329
...of the 15 hijackers?

42:50.042 --> 42:52.272
Why would Saudi Arabia
become reluctant...

42:52.444 --> 42:54.674
...to freeze the hijackers' assets?

42:58.317 --> 43:00.979
The two of them walked out
on the Truman Balcony...

43:01.153 --> 43:04.645
...so that Bandar could smoke a cigar
and have a drink.

43:05.090 --> 43:10.858
In the distance, across the Potomac,
was the Pentagon, partially in ruins.

43:11.029 --> 43:15.159
I wonder if Mr. Bush
told Prince Bandar not to worry...

43:15.334 --> 43:19.031
...because he already had a plan
in motion.

43:20.005 --> 43:20.139
You come in September 12th...

43:20.139 --> 43:21.265
You come in September 12th...

43:23.108 --> 43:26.566
...to plot our response to al Qaeda.
Let me talk about the response...

43:26.745 --> 43:29.145
...you got from top administration
officials.

43:29.314 --> 43:31.748
On that day, what did the president
say to you?

43:31.917 --> 43:36.251
The president, in a very intimidating
way, left me and my staff...

43:36.421 --> 43:39.390
...with the clear indication
he wanted us to come back...

43:39.558 --> 43:42.584
...with the word that there was
an Iraqi hand behind 9l11.

43:42.761 --> 43:46.492
They planned to do something about
Iraq before they came into office.

43:46.665 --> 43:49.532
Did he ask about any other nations
other than Iraq?

43:49.701 --> 43:53.102
No, not at all. It was, "Iraq, Saddam,
find out, get back to me."

43:53.272 --> 43:55.866
Were his questions more about Iraq
than al Qaeda?

43:56.041 --> 43:58.305
Absolutely. He didn't ask me
about al Qaeda.

43:58.477 --> 44:01.446
And the reaction you got from
the defense secretary, Rumsfeld...

44:01.613 --> 44:04.013
...from his assistant, Paul Wolfowitz?

44:04.183 --> 44:06.651
Donald Rumsfeld said...
When we talked about bombing...

44:06.818 --> 44:09.013
...the al Qaeda infrastructure
in Afghanistan...

44:09.188 --> 44:11.713
...he said, "There are
no good targets in Afghanistan.

44:11.890 --> 44:13.118
Let's bomb Iraq."

44:13.292 --> 44:15.988
And we said, "But Iraq had nothing
to do with this."

44:16.161 --> 44:19.096
That didn't make much difference.
The reason they had...

44:19.264 --> 44:22.995
...to do Afghanistan first was, it was
obvious al Qaeda attacked us.

44:23.168 --> 44:26.069
And it was obvious that al Qaeda
was in Afghanistan.

44:26.238 --> 44:29.765
Americans wouldn't stand by
if we'd done nothing on Afghanistan.

44:46.258 --> 44:49.091
The United States began bombing
Afghanistan...

44:49.261 --> 44:52.822
...just four weeks after 9/11.
Mr. Bush said he was doing so...

44:52.998 --> 44:55.660
...because the Taliban government
of Afghanistan...

44:55.834 --> 44:58.325
...had been harboring bin Laden.

44:59.338 --> 45:01.067
We will smoke them
out of their holes.

45:01.240 --> 45:02.605
We're gonna smoke them out.

45:02.774 --> 45:06.801
- We'll smoke him out of his cave.
- Let's rush them and smoke them out.

45:06.979 --> 45:11.678
For all his tough talk,
Bush really didn't do much.

45:11.850 --> 45:14.842
Well, what they did was slow
and small.

45:15.020 --> 45:18.046
They put only 11,000 troops
into Afghanistan.

45:18.223 --> 45:20.282
There are more police here
in Manhattan.

45:20.459 --> 45:23.860
More in Manhattan than there are
U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

45:24.029 --> 45:27.988
The president botched the response.
He should have gone after bin Laden.

45:28.166 --> 45:31.897
The U.S. Special Forces didn't get into
the area where bin Laden was...

45:32.070 --> 45:35.665
...for two months.
- Two months?

45:35.841 --> 45:38.366
A mass murderer who attacked
the United States...

45:38.543 --> 45:41.034
...was given a two-month head start?

45:41.213 --> 45:43.875
Who in their right mind
would do that?

45:44.049 --> 45:46.779
- Dang! Anybody say "nice shot"?
- Nice shot.

45:46.952 --> 45:48.510
Hell of a shot.

45:48.687 --> 45:52.350
Or was the war in Afghanistan
really about something else?

45:52.524 --> 45:56.051
Perhaps the answer
was in Houston, Texas.

45:58.664 --> 46:02.498
In 1997, while George W. Bush
was governor of Texas...

46:02.668 --> 46:06.900
...a delegation of Taliban leaders
from Afghanistan flew to Houston...

46:07.072 --> 46:09.131
...to meet with Unocal executives...

46:09.308 --> 46:12.607
...to discuss the building of a pipeline
through Afghanistan...

46:12.778 --> 46:15.804
...bringing natural gas
from the Caspian Sea.

46:15.981 --> 46:18.472
And who got a Caspian Sea
drilling contract...

46:18.650 --> 46:21.483
...the same day Unocal
signed the pipeline deal?

46:21.653 --> 46:25.521
A company headed by a man
named Dick Cheney. Halliburton.

46:25.691 --> 46:27.852
From the point of view
of the U.S. government...

46:29.461 --> 46:31.258
...this was kind of a magic pipeline...

46:31.430 --> 46:33.762
...because it could serve
so many purposes.

46:33.932 --> 46:37.299
And who else stood to benefit
from the pipeline?

46:37.469 --> 46:40.768
Bush's number-one campaign
contributor, Kenneth Lay...

46:40.939 --> 46:43.407
...and the good people of Enron.

46:45.344 --> 46:47.574
Only the British press
covered this trip.

46:47.946 --> 46:51.575
Then in 2001, just five and a half
months before 9/11...

46:53.151 --> 46:55.619
...the Bush administration welcomed
a Taliban envoy...

46:55.787 --> 46:57.345
...to tour the United States...

46:57.522 --> 47:00.389
...to help improve the image
of the Taliban government.

47:00.559 --> 47:04.120
You have imprisoned the women.
It's a horror, let me tell you.

47:04.296 --> 47:07.595
I'm sorry to your husband. He must
have a difficult time with you.

47:07.766 --> 47:10.564
Here is the Taliban official
visiting our State Department...

47:12.137 --> 47:13.832
...to meet with U.S. officials.

47:14.639 --> 47:17.870
Why would the Bush administration
allow a Taliban leader...

47:18.043 --> 47:21.069
...to visit the United States,
knowing that the Taliban...

47:21.246 --> 47:24.545
...were harboring the man
who bombed the U.S.S. Cole...

47:24.716 --> 47:27.276
...and our African embassies?

47:27.452 --> 47:31.081
Well, I guess 9/11 put a stop to that.

47:31.256 --> 47:34.248
When the invasion of Afghanistan
was complete...

47:34.426 --> 47:37.759
...we installed its new president,
Hamid Karzai.

47:37.929 --> 47:40.295
Who was Hamid Karzai?

47:40.465 --> 47:43.901
He was a former adviser to Unocal.

47:44.069 --> 47:47.061
Bush also appointed,
as our envoy to Afghanistan...

47:47.239 --> 47:52.802
...Zalmay Khalilzad, who was also
a former Unocal adviser.

47:53.812 --> 47:57.578
I guess you can probably see
where this is leading.

47:57.749 --> 48:01.014
Faster than you can say, "Black gold,
Texas tea, " Afghanistan signed...

48:01.186 --> 48:03.586
...an agreement with her
neighboring countries...

48:03.755 --> 48:08.852
...to build a pipeline carrying
natural gas from the Caspian Sea.

48:09.361 --> 48:11.352
Oh, and the Taliban?

48:12.297 --> 48:14.788
Oh, they mostly got away.

48:15.333 --> 48:18.598
As did Osama bin Laden
and most of al Qaeda.

48:19.070 --> 48:21.698
Terror is bigger than one person.

48:21.873 --> 48:26.173
And he's a person who's now
been marginalized.

48:26.344 --> 48:27.834
So I don't know where he is.

48:28.013 --> 48:31.312
I just don't spend that much time
on him, to be honest with you.

48:31.483 --> 48:35.442
Didn't spend much time on him?
What kind of president was he?

48:35.754 --> 48:39.554
I'm a war president. I make decisions
here in the Oval Office...

48:39.724 --> 48:43.023
...in foreign policy matters
with war on my mind.

48:43.628 --> 48:47.120
With the war in Afghanistan over
and bin Laden forgotten...

48:47.299 --> 48:49.893
...the war president had
a new target:

48:52.103 --> 48:54.731
The American people.

48:58.009 --> 49:01.570
We've got an unusual terror warning
from the feds to tell you about.

49:01.746 --> 49:03.805
Fox News has obtained
an FBI bulletin...

49:03.982 --> 49:07.440
...that warns terrorists could use
pen guns, like in James Bond...

49:07.619 --> 49:09.644
...filled with poison.
- Good evening.

49:09.821 --> 49:13.382
America is on high alert tonight,
just four days before Christmas.

49:13.558 --> 49:17.995
- A possible terror threat.
- As bad as or worse than 9l11.

49:18.163 --> 49:21.758
But where? How?
There's nothing specific to report.

49:21.933 --> 49:25.869
Be on the lookout for model airplanes
packed with explosives.

49:27.572 --> 49:31.133
The FBI is warning ferries may be
considered particularly at risk...

49:31.309 --> 49:33.243
...for hijacking.

49:34.446 --> 49:37.643
Could these cattle be a target
for terrorists?

49:39.784 --> 49:41.308
- Fear works.
- Fear does work, yes.

49:44.289 --> 49:46.154
You can make people do anything
if they're afraid.

49:46.324 --> 49:48.087
And how do you make them afraid?

49:48.260 --> 49:53.926
Well, you make them afraid
by creating an aura of endless threat.

49:54.099 --> 49:55.691
They played us like an organ.

49:55.867 --> 50:00.736
They raised the orange, up to red,
then they dropped it back to orange.

50:00.906 --> 50:04.933
I mean, they gave these mixed
messages, which were crazy-making.

50:05.110 --> 50:08.477
The world is changed
after September the 11 th.

50:08.647 --> 50:10.979
It's changed because
we're no longer safe.

50:11.149 --> 50:15.381
Fly and enjoy America's
great destination spots.

50:15.554 --> 50:18.580
We have entered what may
prove to be the most dangerous...

50:18.757 --> 50:20.952
...security environment
the world's known.

50:21.126 --> 50:23.617
Take your families and enjoy life.

50:23.795 --> 50:26.025
Terrorists are doing everything
they can...

50:26.197 --> 50:28.495
...to gain even deadlier means
of striking us.

50:29.034 --> 50:32.868
- Go down to Disney World in Florida.
- It's like training a dog.

50:33.038 --> 50:36.872
You tell him sit down and roll over
at the same time, dog doesn't know...

50:37.042 --> 50:40.102
...what to do. American people
were being treated like that.

50:40.278 --> 50:45.181
It was very, very skillfully and ugly,
in what they did.

50:45.350 --> 50:47.784
We must stop the terror.

50:47.953 --> 50:54.358
I call upon all nations to do everything
they can to stop these terrorist killers.

50:55.093 --> 50:56.685
Thank you.

50:56.861 --> 50:58.089
Now watch this drive.

51:00.932 --> 51:02.797
All right. You give me another one.

51:03.101 --> 51:08.164
They will continue, in my view, as long
as this administration is in charge...

51:08.340 --> 51:12.572
...of every once in a while,
stimulating everybody to be afraid.

51:12.744 --> 51:14.177
Just in case you forgot.

51:14.346 --> 51:18.646
It's not gonna go down to green
or blue. It's never gonna get there.

51:18.817 --> 51:22.253
There clearly is no way
that anyone...

51:22.420 --> 51:25.719
...can live constantly on edge
like that.

51:25.890 --> 51:27.653
The reality facing
American families...

51:29.227 --> 51:31.320
...is they're not as safe
as they used to be.

51:31.496 --> 51:34.090
Drug dealers and users looking
for their next fix.

51:34.265 --> 51:37.291
Gangs who roam the streets
in search of their next victim.

51:37.469 --> 51:41.064
And the growing threat of terrorists
means the need for protection...

51:41.239 --> 51:44.470
...is ever greater.
And now that protection is here.

51:44.643 --> 51:49.012
Zytech Engineering, LLC has
developed and tested a safe room...

51:49.180 --> 51:52.149
...finally affordable to the average
American citizen.

51:52.317 --> 51:56.083
Protection formerly obtainable
only by the wealthy or powerful.

51:56.254 --> 51:59.815
Heck, you can be sitting in here,
drinking your finest Bordeaux...

51:59.991 --> 52:04.155
...and enjoying life, while chaos
is erupting outside.

52:04.529 --> 52:07.623
Every family in America
should prepare itself...

52:07.799 --> 52:09.562
...for a terrorist attack.

52:10.035 --> 52:13.562
Now to escaping from a skyscraper.
John Rivers is the CEO...

52:13.738 --> 52:18.038
...of the Executive Chute Corporation.
Good morning to you, John.

52:18.209 --> 52:21.269
- Good morning, Matt.
- Tell me about the product.

52:21.446 --> 52:25.542
It's an emergency escape chute.
It's an option of last resort.

52:25.717 --> 52:27.742
How high do you have to be
in the building...

52:27.919 --> 52:30.547
...for that chute to actually
take effect?

52:30.722 --> 52:33.520
You only have to be on the 10th floor
or above.

52:33.692 --> 52:35.717
They can put this on themselves?

52:35.894 --> 52:38.294
Right. They can put this on
themselves in as easy...

52:38.463 --> 52:41.591
...as about 30 seconds.
It's real easy to put on.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.331
- Here.
- Sorry.

52:43.501 --> 52:47.028
That's okay. Real easy to put on,
but...

52:48.206 --> 52:51.437
When you first get this chute,
you're gonna wanna put it on...

52:51.609 --> 52:55.375
...and try it on a few times yourself.
- Jaime's having trouble putting that on.

52:55.547 --> 52:59.950
Is this something that you honestly
think, in a moment of panic...

53:00.118 --> 53:03.417
...that someone can operate
properly?

53:03.588 --> 53:07.217
Oh, yeah. It is. This is actually...
Jamie's probably never...

53:07.392 --> 53:09.622
...put this thing on before in her life.

53:10.428 --> 53:13.090
It's okay. It's something that,
when you get it...

53:13.264 --> 53:15.664
...you're gonna wanna put it on
several times.

53:15.834 --> 53:19.497
Despite the raising of the terror alert
level, residents here continue...

53:19.671 --> 53:21.468
...with their Christmas errands.

53:21.639 --> 53:24.870
Frances and her family do some
last-minute holiday shopping...

53:25.043 --> 53:27.477
...knowing al Qaeda is planning
to attack.

53:27.645 --> 53:30.808
She says being in Saginaw doesn't
make her feel any safer...

53:30.982 --> 53:33.007
...than if she was in New York City.

53:33.184 --> 53:34.412
Midland is close by...

53:35.987 --> 53:38.012
...and I said,
"Detroit's not that far away."

53:38.189 --> 53:42.148
I said, "That could be something...
And Flint could be something... Be...

53:42.327 --> 53:45.262
...concerns for people around here."
- You never know...

53:45.430 --> 53:47.455
...where they're gonna hit.
Never know.

53:47.632 --> 53:50.760
But one potential target specifically
mentioned by the terrorists...

53:50.935 --> 53:55.269
...has security officials baffled.
It's tiny Tappahannock, Virginia...

53:55.440 --> 53:57.101
...population, 2016.

53:57.275 --> 54:00.403
Such an attack could generate
widespread fear...

54:00.578 --> 54:05.982
...that even here in rural, small-town
America, no one is entirely safe.

54:07.552 --> 54:09.986
On the news there was
an alert in Tappahannock.

54:10.355 --> 54:13.188
- What did the FBI tell you?
- Well, they contacted me by phone.

54:14.826 --> 54:17.624
Basically let me know about this,
were it Tappahannock.

54:17.796 --> 54:21.562
- That's how it started.
- In the so-called chatter they pick up...

54:21.733 --> 54:25.191
...they wasn't sure Tappahannock.
There's a Rappahannock County...

54:25.370 --> 54:28.271
...Rappahannock River.
- There is a Rappahannock...

54:28.439 --> 54:31.033
A place called Rappahannock.
They got it mixed up.

54:31.743 --> 54:34.211
This is Tappahannock,
not Rappahannock.

54:34.379 --> 54:37.507
- Is there any target around here?
- Not that we can think of.

54:37.682 --> 54:39.547
- It can happen anywhere.
- Wal-Mart.

54:39.717 --> 54:41.685
A big spaghetti supper in here.

54:41.853 --> 54:43.150
Wal-Mart, probably.

54:43.321 --> 54:45.721
Do you feel extra suspicious
of outsiders?

54:45.890 --> 54:47.949
Oh, everybody does that.

54:48.126 --> 54:50.026
That's just something that happens.

54:50.195 --> 54:53.653
When I look at certain people,
I wonder, "Oh, my goodness.

54:53.832 --> 54:55.993
Do you think they could be
a terrorist?"

54:56.167 --> 54:58.294
- Never know what's gonna happen.
- Right.

54:58.469 --> 54:59.936
It could happen right now.

55:00.872 --> 55:03.397
Never trust nobody you don't know.

55:04.209 --> 55:07.872
And even if you do know them,
you really can't trust them then.

55:08.246 --> 55:11.238
From Tappahannock
to Rappahannock...

55:11.416 --> 55:16.080
...to every town and village in
America, the people were afraid.

55:16.521 --> 55:19.012
And they turned to their leader
to protect them.

55:19.190 --> 55:22.455
But protect them from what?

55:47.852 --> 55:50.082
Meet John Ashcroft.

55:50.255 --> 55:54.692
In 2000, he was running for
re-election as senator for Missouri...

55:54.859 --> 55:59.023
...against a man who died
the month before the election.

55:59.197 --> 56:02.257
The voters preferred the dead guy.

56:02.433 --> 56:07.063
So George W. Bush made him
his attorney general.

56:07.238 --> 56:09.604
He was sworn in on a stack
of Bibles.

56:09.774 --> 56:11.901
Because when you can't beat
a dead guy...

56:12.076 --> 56:14.374
...you need all the help you can get.

56:14.545 --> 56:16.570
During the summer before 9/11...

56:16.748 --> 56:19.740
...Ashcroft told acting FBI director,
Thomas Pickard...

56:19.918 --> 56:23.615
...that he didn't want to hear
anything more about terrorist threats.

56:23.788 --> 56:28.054
Mr. Watson had come to you and said
that the CIA was very concerned...

56:28.226 --> 56:30.194
...that there would be an attack.

56:30.361 --> 56:34.764
You said that you told the attorney
general this fact repeatedly...

56:34.933 --> 56:36.924
...in these meetings. That correct?

56:37.101 --> 56:38.898
I've told him at least
on two occasions.

56:40.471 --> 56:43.133
And you told the staff,
according to this statement...

56:43.308 --> 56:47.972
...Mr. Ashcroft told you that he did not
want to hear about this anymore.

56:48.146 --> 56:50.842
- Is that correct?
- That is correct.

56:51.015 --> 56:54.416
His own FBI knew that summer
there were al Qaeda members...

56:54.585 --> 56:58.544
...in the U.S. and bin Laden was
sending his agents to flight schools...

56:58.723 --> 57:00.350
...around the country.

57:00.525 --> 57:04.052
But Ashcroft's Justice Department
turned a blind eye...

57:04.228 --> 57:05.695
...and a deaf ear.

57:05.863 --> 57:10.095
But after 9/11, John Ashcroft
had some brilliant ideas...

57:10.268 --> 57:12.202
...for how to protect America.

57:12.370 --> 57:15.032
The Patriot Act, adopted by Congress
and signed by Bush...

57:15.206 --> 57:16.901
...six weeks after the attacks...

57:17.075 --> 57:19.475
...has changed the way
the government does business.

57:19.644 --> 57:23.944
The Patriot Act allows for searches
of medical and financial records...

57:24.115 --> 57:26.276
...computer and telephone
conversations...

57:26.451 --> 57:30.478
...even for the books you take out of
the library. But people we spoke to...

57:30.655 --> 57:33.988
...say they're willing to give up
liberties to fight terrorism.

57:34.158 --> 57:38.492
- Maybe that's a good thing.
- It's sad, but it has to be done.

57:38.663 --> 57:42.224
Yes, something needed to be done.

57:42.400 --> 57:45.733
These are the good people
who make up Peace Fresno.

57:45.903 --> 57:48.963
A community group
in Fresno, California.

57:49.407 --> 57:52.843
Unlike the rest of us,
they received an early lesson...

57:53.011 --> 57:55.741
...in what the Patriot Act is all about.

57:55.913 --> 58:00.247
Each week, they meet to discuss
matters of peace.

58:00.418 --> 58:05.788
They sit around, they share stories,
they eat cookies.

58:05.957 --> 58:08.551
Some have more than one.

58:09.527 --> 58:13.190
This is Aaron Stokes,
a member of Peace Fresno.

58:13.765 --> 58:15.357
The other members liked him.

58:15.533 --> 58:18.263
He had come to the meetings,
he went with us.

58:18.436 --> 58:22.372
We go out on Friday nights and stand
on a very busy corner in Fresno.

58:22.540 --> 58:25.668
And he had gone with us,
he had handed out fliers.

58:25.843 --> 58:29.973
He went with us in June
to a WTO protest.

58:30.148 --> 58:33.049
Then one day, Aaron didn't show up
to the meeting.

58:33.217 --> 58:36.550
My friend Dan and I were reading
the Sunday newspaper...

58:36.721 --> 58:40.384
...and when I picked up the paper,
in the local section...

58:40.558 --> 58:42.287
...Aaron's picture caught my eye.

58:42.460 --> 58:45.520
The article said that a sheriff's deputy
had been killed...

58:45.696 --> 58:49.223
...and I saw it had a name
that wasn't the right name...

58:49.400 --> 58:54.770
...that said that he was a member
of the sheriff's antiterrorism unit.

58:54.939 --> 58:56.304
That's right.

58:56.474 --> 58:59.034
The photo of the man
in the newspaper...

58:59.243 --> 59:02.542
...was not the Aaron Stokes
they had come to know.

59:02.713 --> 59:09.175
He was actually Deputy Aaron Kilner,
and he had infiltrated their group.

59:09.353 --> 59:12.049
Sheriff Pierce made it very clear
that, yes...

59:12.223 --> 59:15.283
...Aaron Kilner was assigned
to infiltrate Peace Fresno...

59:15.460 --> 59:18.691
...that he was able to infiltrate
organizations...

59:18.863 --> 59:20.626
...that are open to the public.

59:21.032 --> 59:23.728
You could understand why the police
needed to spy...

59:23.901 --> 59:25.664
...on a group like Peace Fresno.

59:26.003 --> 59:27.698
Just look at them.

59:28.940 --> 59:32.501
A gathering of terrorists
if I ever saw one.

59:33.144 --> 59:36.136
This is Barry Reingold,
a retired phone worker...

59:36.314 --> 59:38.839
...from Oakland, California.

59:39.016 --> 59:41.951
Barry likes to work out in the gym.

59:42.120 --> 59:45.453
Somewhere between his cardio
and his strength training...

59:45.623 --> 59:48.114
...Barry got political.

59:48.292 --> 59:51.921
We were up in the gym,
and it was after we were working out...

59:52.096 --> 59:55.964
...and a number of us were talking
about 9l11 and Afghanistan...

59:56.134 --> 01:00:00.503
...and bin Laden, and someone said,
"Bin Laden's a real asshole...

01:00:00.671 --> 01:00:04.004
...for murdering those people."
And I said, "Yeah, that's true.

01:00:04.175 --> 01:00:07.736
But he'll never be as big
an asshole as Bush...

01:00:07.912 --> 01:00:10.506
...who bombs all over the world
for oil profits."

01:00:10.681 --> 01:00:14.412
Barry didn't have to worry
about the police spying on him.

01:00:14.819 --> 01:00:18.516
His fellow weightlifters
were more than willing to turn him in.

01:00:18.689 --> 01:00:23.490
I was taking a nap, and I guess
it was 1:30, 2:00 in the afternoon.

01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:27.722
And they came to my place,
and I said, "Well, who's there?"

01:00:27.899 --> 01:00:32.802
And they said, "The FBI."
I said, "The FBI? Why are they here?"

01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:38.306
Yes, the FBI had come to see Barry.
And they weren't there to Jazzercise.

01:00:38.476 --> 01:00:44.312
The FBI said, "Have you been talking
to people about 9l11 and bin Laden...

01:00:44.482 --> 01:00:48.942
...and oil profits and Afghanistan?"
I said, "A lot of people are talking...

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.917
...about these things."

01:00:51.088 --> 01:00:55.024
I feel my rights have been,
you know, trampled on.

01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:59.323
I mean, if you have something to say
to me in the gym, well, then, fine.

01:00:59.497 --> 01:01:04.560
Don't tell the FBI, and they come to
my apartment while I'm taking a nap.

01:01:04.735 --> 01:01:07.135
Nothing to be ashamed of.
There's full transparency.

01:01:08.973 --> 01:01:11.533
There's nothing about the Patriot Act
I am ashamed of...

01:01:11.709 --> 01:01:13.472
...in any way, shape or form.

01:01:13.644 --> 01:01:15.635
I have a 1-800 number. Call me.

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:19.775
I'm the guy you call
if there's a violation or an abuse.

01:01:21.352 --> 01:01:23.752
If you've got a poster child on this,
I wanna see it.

01:01:23.921 --> 01:01:27.379
I'm hired by the people to provide
oversight. I provide oversight.

01:01:27.558 --> 01:01:30.425
Trent Lott said,
the day the bill was introduced:

01:01:30.595 --> 01:01:34.827
"Maybe now we can do things
we've wanted to do the last 10 years."

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:39.897
No, a dictatorship would be a heck
of a lot easier, no question about it.

01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:44.064
I mean, they had all this on the shelf
somewhere.

01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:48.611
Ideas of things they would like to do.
And they got 9l11...

01:01:48.779 --> 01:01:51.270
...and they said, "It's our chance.
Go for it."

01:01:51.449 --> 01:01:53.610
There was an assumption
of the administration...

01:01:56.821 --> 01:02:00.814
...that there had to be a surrender
of certain of our rights.

01:02:00.992 --> 01:02:02.892
There's troubling definitions
in the bill.

01:02:05.863 --> 01:02:09.799
The definition of terrorist,
it's so expansive...

01:02:09.967 --> 01:02:13.926
...that it could include people who...
- Like me.

01:02:14.105 --> 01:02:16.596
No one read it.
That's the whole point.

01:02:16.774 --> 01:02:21.507
They wait till the middle of the night,
drop it in the night, print it in the night.

01:02:21.679 --> 01:02:24.170
And the next morning when we
come in, it passes.

01:02:24.382 --> 01:02:29.786
How could Congress pass this
Patriot Act without even reading it?

01:02:29.954 --> 01:02:32.218
Sit down, my son.

01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:36.850
We don't read most of the bills.

01:02:37.428 --> 01:02:40.124
Do you really know what that
would entail...

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:44.735
...if we were to read every bill
that we passed?

01:02:47.805 --> 01:02:51.673
Well, the good thing, it would
slow down the legislative process.

01:02:51.842 --> 01:02:54.902
I couldn't believe that virtually
no member of Congress...

01:02:55.079 --> 01:02:57.809
...had read the Patriot Act
before voting on it.

01:02:57.982 --> 01:03:01.247
So I decided the only patriotic thing
to do...

01:03:01.419 --> 01:03:05.185
...was for me to read it to them.

01:03:05.489 --> 01:03:08.049
Members of Congress,
this is Michael Moore...

01:03:08.225 --> 01:03:11.023
...I would like to read you
the U.S.A. Patriot Act.

01:03:11.195 --> 01:03:12.423
"Section 1:

01:03:12.596 --> 01:03:15.963
Section 210 of this code
reads as follows..."

01:03:16.133 --> 01:03:18.033
"Section 2703C..."

01:03:18.202 --> 01:03:18.336
My job is to secure the homeland.
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:21.794
My job is to secure the homeland.
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

01:03:21.972 --> 01:03:24.770
But I'm here to take
somebody's order.

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:27.208
That's you, stretch.
What would you like?

01:03:27.378 --> 01:03:29.778
- Right behind you.
- I'm gonna order some ribs.

01:03:29.947 --> 01:03:32.211
We all know you can't
secure the homeland...

01:03:32.383 --> 01:03:35.375
...on an empty stomach.
And in order to remain secure...

01:03:35.553 --> 01:03:37.987
...everyone needs to sacrifice.

01:03:38.956 --> 01:03:42.016
Especially little Patrick Hamilton.

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:47.995
I'm sure each of us has our own
airport-security horror story.

01:03:48.399 --> 01:03:50.697
But here's my favorite.

01:03:50.868 --> 01:03:55.396
The terrorist threat that was posed
by his mommy's breast milk.

01:03:55.573 --> 01:03:59.304
I thought if I put a little bit on my lips,
that would be sufficient...

01:03:59.477 --> 01:04:02.708
...because I'm tasting it.
She looked at me, and I felt like...

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.611
...she was telling me, "Chug that."
She goes, "You need to drink more."

01:04:06.784 --> 01:04:09.048
And of a 4-ounce bottle,
I wound up drinking...

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.017
...2 more ounces of breast milk...

01:04:11.188 --> 01:04:14.123
...that then, because it's touched
my lips, has to be tossed.

01:04:14.558 --> 01:04:17.322
While homeland security
was making sure breast milk...

01:04:17.495 --> 01:04:19.087
...was kept off our planes...

01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:22.629
...they were also doing everything
possible to ensure no one...

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.768
...could light a firebomb onboard.

01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:29.032
- I can bring that on the plane?
- Actually, yes, you're fine.

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.232
One too many books of matches.

01:04:31.409 --> 01:04:33.934
You can have four books
and two lighters.

01:04:34.111 --> 01:04:35.874
When we already have
the shoe-bomber...

01:04:38.048 --> 01:04:39.913
...who would have blown up
an airplane...

01:04:40.084 --> 01:04:42.746
...if he had a butane lighter,
according to the FBI...

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.480
...why would Transportation Security
say it's okay...

01:04:45.656 --> 01:04:48.056
...to take four books of matches
and two lighters...

01:04:48.225 --> 01:04:51.194
...as you board a plane? I'm guessing
somebody put pressure on...

01:04:52.763 --> 01:04:55.664
...to say, "When an airplane lands,
people wanna light up...

01:04:55.833 --> 01:04:57.630
...so don't take their lighters away."

01:04:57.802 --> 01:04:59.793
Let me see if I got this straight.

01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:03.804
Old guys in the gym, bad.
Peace groups in Fresno, bad.

01:05:03.974 --> 01:05:05.236
Breast milk, really bad.

01:05:05.409 --> 01:05:08.469
Matches and lighters on the plane?
Hey, no problem.

01:05:08.646 --> 01:05:13.811
Was this really about our safety?
Or was something else going on?

01:05:15.753 --> 01:05:19.883
This is where the Pacific Ocean
meets the shores of Oregon.

01:05:20.057 --> 01:05:25.290
Over 100 miles of beautiful,
open coastline on our border.

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:28.899
And, thanks to the budget
cutbacks...

01:05:29.066 --> 01:05:32.593
...the total number of state police
protecting it:

01:05:33.003 --> 01:05:34.436
One.

01:05:35.706 --> 01:05:37.401
Part-time.

01:05:37.875 --> 01:05:39.934
Meet Trooper Brooks.

01:05:40.110 --> 01:05:43.409
I maybe get a chance to hit
this stretch of highway...

01:05:43.948 --> 01:05:48.282
...once, maybe twice a week
during my shifts.

01:05:48.452 --> 01:05:51.819
You know, just to even drive up here
and look.

01:05:51.989 --> 01:05:56.085
You know, I mean, as far as I know,
there's lots of things they could do.

01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:59.696
I don't even wanna suspect,
because it just makes me ill inside.

01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:03.761
Back at the state trooper patrol office,
thanks to the budget cuts...

01:06:03.934 --> 01:06:06.232
...Trooper Kenyon had to come in
on his day off...

01:06:06.403 --> 01:06:08.303
...to catch up on some paperwork.

01:06:08.472 --> 01:06:11.532
For the most part, especially during
summer, when people show up...

01:06:11.709 --> 01:06:13.802
...this is what they get.
They close the door.

01:06:13.978 --> 01:06:16.412
They can read the sign
about the office closure.

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:20.038
It just basically explains
that due to our cutbacks...

01:06:20.217 --> 01:06:23.186
...our office is not open
for administrative business.

01:06:23.354 --> 01:06:26.846
There's a sign that explains
when the office is closed...

01:06:27.024 --> 01:06:32.018
...they can use the phone booth
to get in touch with our dispatch.

01:06:32.563 --> 01:06:35.123
Ironically enough, that phone
is a piece of junk.

01:06:35.299 --> 01:06:37.699
It doesn't work very well,
so half the time...

01:06:37.868 --> 01:06:40.996
...they pick up the phone
and dispatch gets static.

01:06:41.171 --> 01:06:42.536
They don't hear anything.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.100
For Tuesday, there'll be
no troop on patrol.

01:06:46.277 --> 01:06:48.245
Wednesday, there'll be no troop
on patrol.

01:06:48.412 --> 01:06:50.471
Thursday, there'll be
no troop on patrol.

01:06:50.648 --> 01:06:52.240
You get calls all the time.

01:06:52.416 --> 01:06:54.441
People will call in
a suspicious vehicle...

01:06:54.618 --> 01:06:56.779
...or somebody looking suspicious.

01:06:56.954 --> 01:06:59.787
And I don't hardly ever respond
to that anymore.

01:06:59.957 --> 01:07:01.618
I just don't have the time to do it.

01:07:01.792 --> 01:07:04.260
I asked, "How many people do
we have in Oregon...

01:07:04.428 --> 01:07:05.895
...on duty tonight?"

01:07:06.063 --> 01:07:08.258
And we had eight troopers...

01:07:08.432 --> 01:07:11.367
...on for the entire state of Oregon,
working.

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:17.734
I think Oregon is a prime example
that homeland security...

01:07:17.908 --> 01:07:21.844
...is not as secure as what people
would like to believe.

01:07:22.012 --> 01:07:25.641
Nobody's sent me a manual that says,
"Here's how you catch a terrorist."

01:07:25.816 --> 01:07:30.185
If I had that manual, I'd read it.
But I don't. So...

01:07:30.354 --> 01:07:32.185
Yeah.

01:07:32.723 --> 01:07:35.556
The Bush administration
didn't hand out a manual...

01:07:35.726 --> 01:07:37.887
...on how to deal
with the terrorist threat...

01:07:38.062 --> 01:07:41.793
...because the terrorist threat
wasn't what this was all about.

01:07:42.533 --> 01:07:44.899
They just wanted us
to be fearful enough...

01:07:45.069 --> 01:07:49.062
...so that we'd get behind
what their real plan was.

01:07:53.744 --> 01:07:55.006
Four minutes.

01:07:55.179 --> 01:07:56.976
- Right from the top.
- All right.

01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:01.941
- How much time?
- Three minutes.

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:07.284
- Okay, folks.
- Thirty seconds.

01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:11.219
- Stand by.
- Fifteen seconds.

01:08:13.597 --> 01:08:18.591
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

01:08:18.769 --> 01:08:22.933
...four, three, two, one.

01:08:23.107 --> 01:08:24.506
My fellow citizens...

01:08:57.541 --> 01:09:00.567
At this hour, American
and coalition forces...

01:09:00.743 --> 01:09:03.508
...are in the early stages
of military operations...

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:04.943
...to disarm Iraq...

01:09:05.115 --> 01:09:08.812
...to free its people and to defend
the world from grave danger.

01:09:08.986 --> 01:09:12.216
On my orders, coalition forces
have begun striking...

01:09:12.389 --> 01:09:14.913
...selected targets
of military importance...

01:09:15.091 --> 01:09:18.720
...to undermine Saddam Hussein's
ability to wage war.

01:09:41.118 --> 01:09:44.144
On March 19th, 2003...

01:09:44.321 --> 01:09:47.620
...George W. Bush
and the United States military...

01:09:47.791 --> 01:09:50.225
...invaded the sovereign nation
of Iraq.

01:09:51.361 --> 01:09:54.728
A nation that had never attacked
the United States.

01:09:56.467 --> 01:10:00.665
A nation that had never threatened
to attack the United States.

01:10:01.839 --> 01:10:07.072
A nation that had never murdered
a single American citizen.

01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:31.526
We're going to find this...
I think this piece of my neighbor.

01:10:31.702 --> 01:10:34.432
Young girl, age 20.

01:10:35.005 --> 01:10:39.442
I think it's the other part
of her body. That's all.

01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:41.745
There is a lot of innocent civilians
that were killed.

01:10:41.745 --> 01:10:44.475
There is a lot of innocent civilians
that were killed.

01:10:44.648 --> 01:10:48.607
And I think that is because
the U.S. Army...

01:10:49.119 --> 01:10:51.781
...we came in, and we knew
it wasn't gonna be easy.

01:10:51.955 --> 01:10:54.446
And pretty much at first
shot anything that moved.

01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:56.490
When war happens
and fighting starts...

01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:59.288
...it's like we're pumped up,
motivated, ready to go.

01:10:59.463 --> 01:11:00.725
It's the ultimate rush.

01:11:00.898 --> 01:11:03.332
Because you know
you're going into the fight...

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:06.025
...then you got a good song
playing in the background.

01:11:06.203 --> 01:11:10.503
And that gets you real fired up.
Ready to do the job.

01:11:10.674 --> 01:11:12.403
You can hook your CD player up...

01:11:12.576 --> 01:11:14.976
...to the tank's internal
communications system.

01:11:15.145 --> 01:11:18.046
When you put your helmet on
you can hear it through the helmet.

01:11:18.215 --> 01:11:19.842
This one we listen to the most.

01:11:20.017 --> 01:11:22.850
This is the one... When we travel,
we kill the enemy...

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:25.488
Drowning Pool.
"Let the bodies hit the floor"...

01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:27.214
...is fitting for the job.

01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:35.125
We picked "the roof is on fire"...

01:11:35.299 --> 01:11:38.393
...because it symbolized
Baghdad being on fire.

01:11:38.569 --> 01:11:42.061
At the time we wanted it to burn
to get Saddam and his regime out.

01:11:42.239 --> 01:11:46.335
The roof, the roof
The roof is on fire

01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:50.507
We don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn

01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:53.673
Burn, motherfucker, burn

01:12:04.528 --> 01:12:09.022
This is a totally different picture here
being pushed into the city.

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:11.224
Urban warfare in a tank.

01:12:11.935 --> 01:12:13.527
Civilians.

01:12:13.971 --> 01:12:15.302
The civilians...

01:12:15.472 --> 01:12:18.236
You don't know who's friendly,
who's the enemy.

01:12:18.408 --> 01:12:21.809
This is a lot more real and true
than just a video game.

01:12:21.979 --> 01:12:25.437
People thought it was gonna be, "Look
through the sight and shoot." No.

01:12:25.616 --> 01:12:27.208
A lot of this is face to face.

01:12:27.384 --> 01:12:30.876
Especially riding by after
some of the bombs went off...

01:12:31.054 --> 01:12:34.114
...and seeing all the people
on the side of the road bloated up.

01:12:34.291 --> 01:12:38.591
And all the smells around you
from the people lying dead, rotted.

01:12:38.762 --> 01:12:41.253
It's a lot more gruesome
than you think.

01:12:41.431 --> 01:12:44.764
We called in with some artillery
and some napalm and things.

01:12:44.935 --> 01:12:46.903
Some innocent women
and children got hit.

01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:49.004
We met them on the road,
and they had...

01:12:49.172 --> 01:12:51.572
...little girls with noses
blown off. And...

01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:53.073
And...

01:12:53.243 --> 01:12:56.178
...husbands carrying their dead wives
and things like that.

01:12:56.346 --> 01:12:59.247
That was extremely difficult
to deal with. You're like:

01:12:59.416 --> 01:13:02.283
"Shoot. What the hell
do we do now?"

01:13:02.886 --> 01:13:07.186
The targeting capabilities
and the care that goes into targeting...

01:13:09.359 --> 01:13:13.591
...is as impressive as anything
anyone could see.

01:13:16.066 --> 01:13:17.499
- Got him.
- Good. Second one.

01:13:17.668 --> 01:13:19.397
Get the other one.

01:13:22.105 --> 01:13:25.302
The care that goes into it,
the humanity that goes into it.

01:14:24.568 --> 01:14:27.162
Honestly, I think we should
just trust our president...

01:14:27.337 --> 01:14:29.999
...in every decision he makes,
and we should support that.

01:14:30.173 --> 01:14:33.438
You know? And be faithful
in what happens.

01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:36.408
- Do you trust this president?
- Yes, I do.

01:14:37.514 --> 01:14:40.108
Britney Spears was not alone.

01:14:40.283 --> 01:14:42.012
The majority
of the American people...

01:14:42.185 --> 01:14:45.621
...trusted the president.
And why shouldn't they?

01:14:45.789 --> 01:14:48.519
He'd spent the better part
of the last year...

01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:52.253
...giving them every reason
why we should invade Iraq.

01:14:52.429 --> 01:14:55.592
Saddam Hussein has gone
to elaborate lengths...

01:14:55.766 --> 01:14:57.427
...spent enormous sums...

01:14:57.601 --> 01:15:02.129
...taken great risks to build and keep
weapons of mass destruction.

01:15:02.305 --> 01:15:06.366
Saddam Hussein is determined
to get his hands on a nuclear bomb.

01:15:06.543 --> 01:15:08.909
Nuclear weapon. Nuclear weapon.
Nuclear weapon.

01:15:09.079 --> 01:15:13.778
Active chemical munitions bunkers.
Mobile production facilities.

01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:15.815
We know he's got
chemical weapons.

01:15:15.986 --> 01:15:17.977
He's got them. He's got them.
He's got them.

01:15:18.155 --> 01:15:20.123
Huh, that's weird.

01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:23.919
Because that's not what Bush's
people said when he first took office.

01:15:25.529 --> 01:15:27.087
He hasn't developed capability...

01:15:27.264 --> 01:15:29.391
...with respect to weapons
of mass destruction.

01:15:29.566 --> 01:15:32.797
He's unable to project conventional
power against his neighbors.

01:15:34.371 --> 01:15:37.636
We're able to keep arms from him.
Military forces haven't been rebuilt.

01:15:37.808 --> 01:15:41.767
Saddam Hussein aids
and protects terrorists...

01:15:41.945 --> 01:15:44.106
...including members of al Qaeda.

01:15:44.281 --> 01:15:47.273
There was a relationship
between Iraq and al Qaeda.

01:15:47.451 --> 01:15:49.783
Saddam. Al Qaeda.
Saddam. Al Qaeda.

01:15:49.953 --> 01:15:53.354
Saddam. The al Qaeda. Saddam.
Saddam. Saddam. Al Qaeda.

01:15:53.523 --> 01:15:55.923
It's only a matter of time
before terrorist states...

01:15:56.093 --> 01:15:58.118
...armed with weapons
of mass destruction...

01:15:58.295 --> 01:16:01.822
...develop the capability to deliver
those weapons to U.S. cities.

01:16:01.998 --> 01:16:04.125
We're giving you facts
and conclusions...

01:16:04.301 --> 01:16:06.132
...based on solid intelligence.

01:16:09.973 --> 01:16:11.463
He's a man who hates America.

01:16:11.641 --> 01:16:14.508
This is a man who cannot stand
what we stand for.

01:16:14.678 --> 01:16:18.114
There's willingness
to terrorize himself.

01:16:18.281 --> 01:16:21.614
He hates the fact, like al Qaeda does,
that we love freedom.

01:16:21.785 --> 01:16:24.686
After all, this is a guy that tried
to kill my dad at one time.

01:16:27.657 --> 01:16:31.491
They got people to believe there was
a threat when in fact there wasn't one.

01:16:31.661 --> 01:16:34.255
You get told things every day
that don't happen.

01:16:34.431 --> 01:16:36.058
It doesn't seem to bother people.

01:16:36.233 --> 01:16:39.134
The Democrats were there to put
a stop to all these falsehoods.

01:16:42.105 --> 01:16:44.073
I'll vote to give the president
authority he needs.

01:16:44.241 --> 01:16:48.371
United States is prepared to lead the
coalition of the willing that will do it.

01:16:48.545 --> 01:16:50.945
When I say we will lead
a coalition of the willing...

01:16:51.114 --> 01:16:53.742
...to disarm him if he chooses
not to disarm, I mean it.

01:16:53.917 --> 01:16:57.683
- Who's in that coalition of the willing?
- You will find out who's in it.

01:16:58.955 --> 01:17:01.480
The coalition of the willing.

01:17:01.658 --> 01:17:02.920
Roll call.

01:17:03.093 --> 01:17:06.085
The Republic of Palau.

01:17:06.263 --> 01:17:10.529
The Republic of Costa Rica.

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:14.431
The Republic of Iceland.

01:17:14.604 --> 01:17:18.540
None of these countries has an army,
or for that matter, weapons.

01:17:18.708 --> 01:17:22.701
So it looked like we'd be doing
most of the invading stuff ourselves.

01:17:23.914 --> 01:17:27.509
- Then there was also:
- Romania.

01:17:27.684 --> 01:17:32.383
The Kingdom of Morocco.

01:17:32.556 --> 01:17:35.548
Morocco wasn't officially
a member of the coalition...

01:17:35.725 --> 01:17:38.956
...but according to one report, they did
offer to send 2000 monkeys...

01:17:39.129 --> 01:17:41.222
...to help detonate land mines.

01:17:42.799 --> 01:17:44.426
These are men of vision.

01:17:44.601 --> 01:17:46.228
The Netherlands.

01:17:46.403 --> 01:17:48.200
And I'm proud to call them allies.

01:17:49.773 --> 01:17:51.741
Afghanistan.

01:17:51.908 --> 01:17:53.739
Afghanistan?

01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:56.140
Oh, yeah. They had an army.

01:17:56.313 --> 01:18:00.306
Our army. I guess that's one way
to build a coalition.

01:18:00.483 --> 01:18:02.883
Just keep invading countries.

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:07.319
Yes, with our mighty coalition intact,
we were ready.

01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:11.051
One could almost say
it's the mother of all coalitions.

01:18:13.763 --> 01:18:16.823
Fortunately, we have an independent
media in this country...

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.934
...who would tell us the truth.

01:18:19.102 --> 01:18:23.129
The rallying around the president,
the flag and the troops has begun.

01:18:23.306 --> 01:18:24.830
And we're gonna win!

01:18:25.008 --> 01:18:27.602
You have to be with troops
to understand the adrenaline.

01:18:27.777 --> 01:18:30.245
I want you to know,
I think Navy SEALs rock.

01:18:30.413 --> 01:18:33.439
The pictures you're seeing
are absolutely phenomenal.

01:18:33.617 --> 01:18:38.111
When my country's at war,
I want my country to win.

01:18:38.288 --> 01:18:41.815
Iraqi opposition has faded
in the face of American power.

01:18:41.992 --> 01:18:46.361
What you're watching here is truly
historic television and journalism.

01:18:46.529 --> 01:18:48.019
It was absolutely electrifying.

01:18:48.198 --> 01:18:51.531
They had to strap me in with my
camera at the back of the plane.

01:18:51.701 --> 01:18:54.101
An awesome, synchronized
killing machine.

01:18:54.271 --> 01:18:55.795
There is an inherent bias...

01:18:55.972 --> 01:18:58.634
...in the coverage of the American
press in general.

01:18:58.808 --> 01:19:01.208
Am I slanted and biased?
You damn well bet I am.

01:19:05.515 --> 01:19:08.075
But one story the media
wasn't covering...

01:19:08.251 --> 01:19:10.014
...was the personal story...

01:19:10.186 --> 01:19:13.553
...of each and every soldier
who was killed in the war.

01:19:13.723 --> 01:19:16.191
The government would not allow
any cameras...

01:19:16.359 --> 01:19:18.623
...to show the coffins coming home.

01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:21.925
That kind of story is a downer...

01:19:22.098 --> 01:19:25.966
...especially when you're getting
ready for a party on a boat.

01:20:08.478 --> 01:20:09.706
My fellow Americans...

01:20:11.281 --> 01:20:14.717
...major combat operations
in Iraq have ended.

01:20:14.884 --> 01:20:16.681
In the battle of Iraq...

01:20:16.853 --> 01:20:21.654
...the United States
and our allies have prevailed.

01:20:32.535 --> 01:20:34.526
Get out of the way!

01:20:41.878 --> 01:20:45.211
Move! Move! Move! Move!

01:21:05.101 --> 01:21:08.070
162, the number of troops
killed by hostile fire.

01:21:08.238 --> 01:21:11.935
- 244 U.S. troops...
- 384 U.S. troops lost their lives...

01:21:12.108 --> 01:21:15.043
- Total killed, 484.
- Died in the line of duty, 500...

01:21:15.211 --> 01:21:16.508
631 American troops...

01:21:16.679 --> 01:21:19.011
More than 825 troops
have been killed in Iraq.

01:21:19.182 --> 01:21:21.980
The largest number of American
military deaths since Vietnam.

01:21:22.152 --> 01:21:28.216
There are some who feel like
that if they attack us...

01:21:28.391 --> 01:21:31.019
...that we may decide
to leave prematurely.

01:21:31.795 --> 01:21:34.195
They don't understand,
if that's the case.

01:21:34.364 --> 01:21:36.161
Let me finish.

01:21:37.033 --> 01:21:41.299
There are some who feel like
the conditions are such...

01:21:41.471 --> 01:21:43.268
...that they can attack us there.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:45.169
My answer is, bring them on.

01:21:59.222 --> 01:22:01.952
The United States was planning
on walking through here...

01:22:02.125 --> 01:22:04.457
...like it was gonna be easy and all.

01:22:04.627 --> 01:22:07.824
But it's not that easy
to conquer a country, is it?

01:22:14.504 --> 01:22:18.497
The renewed battle for control
of Iraq raged for a fourth day today...

01:22:18.675 --> 01:22:22.008
...with street clashes in nearly
every corner of the country.

01:22:22.178 --> 01:22:24.806
Iraq could become "another Vietnam."

01:22:24.981 --> 01:22:28.382
Officials say they see evidence
that Sunni and Shiite extremists...

01:22:28.551 --> 01:22:30.041
...might be joining forces.

01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:32.313
They're not happy they're occupied.

01:22:33.256 --> 01:22:35.850
I wouldn't be happy
if I were occupied either.

01:22:45.468 --> 01:22:47.766
Two Japanese aid workers
and a journalist...

01:22:47.937 --> 01:22:49.996
...kidnapped by men calling
themselves...

01:22:50.173 --> 01:22:52.038
...the Mujahideen Squadrons.

01:22:52.208 --> 01:22:54.369
They threatened to burn
the hostages alive...

01:22:54.544 --> 01:22:58.776
...if Japan does not withdraw its troops
from Iraq within three days.

01:22:59.382 --> 01:23:00.940
What's happened?

01:23:03.286 --> 01:23:04.583
They attacked our convoy.

01:23:05.555 --> 01:23:06.920
You wanna give us your name?

01:23:07.457 --> 01:23:10.051
Hamill, Thomas.

01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:11.194
The Pentagon might keep up
to 24,000 troops in combat...

01:23:11.194 --> 01:23:14.322
The Pentagon might keep up
to 24,000 troops in combat...

01:23:14.497 --> 01:23:15.759
...beyond their tour.

01:23:15.932 --> 01:23:18.264
I know our numbers
in the military have gone down.

01:23:18.434 --> 01:23:20.197
They talk about retention.

01:23:21.804 --> 01:23:23.965
I never expected
to be deployed this long.

01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:25.437
I don't think anybody did.

01:23:25.808 --> 01:23:28.641
I don't have any clue
as to why we're still in Iraq.

01:23:28.811 --> 01:23:32.212
If Donald Rumsfeld was here,
I'd ask him for his resignation.

01:23:33.483 --> 01:23:35.451
With the war not going
as planned...

01:23:35.985 --> 01:23:38.818
...and the military in need
of many more troops...

01:23:39.622 --> 01:23:42.090
...where would they find
the new recruits?

01:23:42.258 --> 01:23:44.249
Military experts say three times...

01:23:44.427 --> 01:23:46.657
...the 120,000 U.S. troops
now deployed...

01:23:46.829 --> 01:23:50.731
...would be needed to pacify
and rebuild the country.

01:23:51.901 --> 01:23:54.734
They would find them
all across America...

01:23:54.904 --> 01:23:58.601
...in the places that had been
destroyed by the economy.

01:23:59.042 --> 01:24:01.670
Places where one
of the only jobs available...

01:24:01.844 --> 01:24:03.778
...was to join the Army.

01:24:03.947 --> 01:24:07.041
Places like my hometown
of Flint, Michigan.

01:24:07.216 --> 01:24:08.843
I was watching TV one day...

01:24:09.018 --> 01:24:12.954
...and they showed some of the areas
that had been hit by bombs.

01:24:13.122 --> 01:24:15.215
And while watching,
I got to thinking...

01:24:15.391 --> 01:24:17.621
...there's parts of Flint
that look like that.

01:24:17.794 --> 01:24:19.284
And we ain't been in a war.

01:24:19.862 --> 01:24:21.727
Look at the neighborhood I live in.

01:24:21.898 --> 01:24:24.298
Most of them are abandoned.
You know, I mean...

01:24:24.467 --> 01:24:27.095
...that's not right.
You wanna talk about terrorism?

01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:30.603
Come right here. President Bush,
right here. Come right here.

01:24:30.773 --> 01:24:33.173
He knows about this corner.
I e-mailed him.

01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:36.444
At the end of January of '04...

01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:39.377
...the unemployment rate
in Flint was 17 percent.

01:24:39.549 --> 01:24:42.143
But you have to take
into consideration as well...

01:24:42.318 --> 01:24:45.287
...that when your unemployment
runs out you're no longer counted.

01:24:45.455 --> 01:24:48.618
I would say that we're close
to at least 50 percent...

01:24:48.791 --> 01:24:51.589
...not working or underemployed.

01:24:51.761 --> 01:24:54.628
Because being underemployed
is just as dangerous.

01:24:55.231 --> 01:24:57.597
My family has gone through
the welfare system...

01:24:57.767 --> 01:24:59.029
...when it was Job Central.

01:24:59.202 --> 01:25:02.330
In the mid-'80s I came through
the job training partnership program.

01:25:04.941 --> 01:25:06.806
I went to a secretary school.

01:25:06.976 --> 01:25:10.571
Years later, I'm executive assistant
to the president of the agency.

01:25:10.747 --> 01:25:12.339
Interesting.

01:25:12.515 --> 01:25:14.380
My mother used to tell me
all the time:

01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:16.677
"Why do you always go
for the underdog?"

01:25:16.853 --> 01:25:19.083
It was because the underdog
is who needed me.

01:25:19.255 --> 01:25:22.782
People that don't have anything,
that's who I have to fight for.

01:25:22.959 --> 01:25:25.154
And that's who I have fought for
my entire life.

01:25:25.328 --> 01:25:28.229
I started taking my children
and telling my children:

01:25:28.398 --> 01:25:29.922
"The military is a good option.

01:25:30.099 --> 01:25:33.034
I can't afford to have you
go to college. I can't pay your way.

01:25:33.202 --> 01:25:34.794
Financial aid will not help you."

01:25:34.971 --> 01:25:37.405
So I, as a mother,
started teaching my children...

01:25:37.573 --> 01:25:39.768
...about the options
that the military could do.

01:25:39.942 --> 01:25:41.705
They would take them
around the world.

01:25:41.878 --> 01:25:45.075
They'd see all the things that I,
as a mother, couldn't let them see.

01:25:45.248 --> 01:25:49.207
It'd pay for their education that I, as
their mother and father, couldn't pay.

01:25:49.385 --> 01:25:51.876
The military is a good option
for kids in Flint.

01:25:52.055 --> 01:25:55.081
The military is an excellent option
for the people of Flint.

01:25:56.659 --> 01:26:00.254
How many of you have a friend
or a family member in the service?

01:26:01.831 --> 01:26:04.391
Anybody currently serving
overseas?

01:26:04.567 --> 01:26:06.364
- A brother of mine.
- My cousin.

01:26:06.536 --> 01:26:07.798
Yeah, cousin.

01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:09.835
- Where's your brother?
- Iraq.

01:26:10.006 --> 01:26:11.837
Germany.

01:26:12.008 --> 01:26:16.104
My cousin got shipped off
to Iraq, like, three days ago.

01:26:16.279 --> 01:26:17.712
Dang.

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:20.110
There's, like, an Army
or Navy recruiter...

01:26:20.283 --> 01:26:23.650
...or Marines recruiter up there
almost every week...

01:26:24.353 --> 01:26:28.414
...in the lunchroom recruiting
students at the lunchroom.

01:26:28.991 --> 01:26:32.324
There are people with a calling.

01:26:35.565 --> 01:26:39.899
Most serve one weekend a month
and two weeks a year.

01:26:42.004 --> 01:26:43.665
Earning money for college.

01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:49.842
Protecting their community.

01:26:51.247 --> 01:26:53.579
In the Army National Guard...

01:26:54.083 --> 01:26:55.345
...you can.

01:26:58.354 --> 01:26:59.685
I'm going into the Air Force.

01:26:59.856 --> 01:27:02.882
I'm gonna take a year off
after high school.

01:27:03.059 --> 01:27:06.495
And then make a career. I wanna be
an aircraft maintenance technician.

01:27:06.662 --> 01:27:09.722
I ran into a recruiter, and there
was something I noticed about it.

01:27:09.899 --> 01:27:12.595
And this is kind of on another...
I noticed it was odd.

01:27:12.769 --> 01:27:15.465
More like he was hiring me
than recruiting me for the Army.

01:27:15.638 --> 01:27:18.766
It was the way he approached me.
I was in Borders Books and Music.

01:27:18.941 --> 01:27:21.205
He came up like he was handing
us a business card.

01:27:21.377 --> 01:27:23.868
He had business cards
made for the Army.

01:27:29.252 --> 01:27:31.812
Meet Marine Staff
Sergeant Dale Kortman...

01:27:31.988 --> 01:27:34.013
...and Sergeant Raymond Plouhar.

01:27:35.124 --> 01:27:39.185
They are two of the many recruiters
assigned to Flint, Michigan.

01:27:39.529 --> 01:27:41.588
They're very busy these days.

01:27:41.764 --> 01:27:43.755
Look, he's running away already.

01:27:43.933 --> 01:27:46.595
- He's seen us coming.
- Yeah.

01:27:47.436 --> 01:27:49.028
What have we got here?

01:27:49.205 --> 01:27:51.469
- Need a little gangster.
- Yeah.

01:27:51.974 --> 01:27:54.704
We're heading over
to the Courtland Mall right now.

01:27:55.812 --> 01:27:57.712
They decided not to go
to the wealthier...

01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:00.212
...Genesee Valley Mall
in the suburbs.

01:28:00.383 --> 01:28:03.250
They have a hard time
recruiting young people there.

01:28:03.419 --> 01:28:06.752
Instead, they went
to the other mall.

01:28:06.923 --> 01:28:09.585
- Let's go in through Mervyn's.
- In through Mervyn's.

01:28:09.759 --> 01:28:13.593
And then we'll walk straight down
and straight back and then go down...

01:28:13.963 --> 01:28:15.988
Gents, you know
we're looking at you, right?

01:28:16.165 --> 01:28:17.826
You guys ever think
about joining up?

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.594
I thought about going to college
and playing basketball.

01:28:20.770 --> 01:28:23.170
- You any good?
- Yeah. Especially basketball.

01:28:23.339 --> 01:28:25.466
Good. You can play ball
for the Marine Corps.

01:28:25.641 --> 01:28:28.474
Travel around the world
for the Corps basketball team.

01:28:28.644 --> 01:28:31.078
- David Robinson was in the military.
- Oh, was he?

01:28:31.247 --> 01:28:33.010
Yeah, you can definitely hook it up.

01:28:33.182 --> 01:28:36.674
Right now somebody out there wants
to be a Marine but has no idea how to.

01:28:36.853 --> 01:28:39.048
- Where you work at?
- I work at KFC.

01:28:39.222 --> 01:28:42.350
- Sweet. Hook us up with deals.
- Yes.

01:28:42.525 --> 01:28:44.288
They're waiting to get recruited.

01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:46.621
I was gonna try a career
in music or something.

01:28:46.796 --> 01:28:50.061
Career in music? Maybe we can
get you a career in music.

01:28:50.233 --> 01:28:53.100
Let the Marines go for it.
I'm sure you know who Shaggy is.

01:28:53.603 --> 01:28:57.437
- You know anything about him?
- Yeah, he's the Jamaican singer.

01:28:57.607 --> 01:28:59.632
How about a former Marine?

01:28:59.809 --> 01:29:01.367
- Oh.
- Did you know it?

01:29:01.544 --> 01:29:04.240
You need to know discipline
if you're gonna get into music.

01:29:04.413 --> 01:29:06.176
Especially discipline
with the money.

01:29:06.349 --> 01:29:08.749
If you make a million, you need
to manage that money.

01:29:08.918 --> 01:29:10.510
Come to the office, we can talk...

01:29:10.686 --> 01:29:12.620
...show you everything
about the Marines.

01:29:12.788 --> 01:29:15.086
- A plan?
- What you got going this afternoon?

01:29:15.258 --> 01:29:17.988
How about tomorrow?
10:00 Monday morning?

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:21.061
- That sounds pretty good.
- You want me to pick you up?

01:29:21.230 --> 01:29:23.790
It's better to get them
when they're in ones and twos...

01:29:23.966 --> 01:29:25.661
...and work on them that way.

01:29:25.835 --> 01:29:27.063
Ladies, ready to join up?

01:29:27.236 --> 01:29:29.261
Green hat right behind us.

01:29:29.438 --> 01:29:33.101
- Looks young. He's young.
- Yeah.

01:29:33.276 --> 01:29:35.506
We got two over here...

01:29:35.678 --> 01:29:37.543
...right over by the red van.

01:29:37.713 --> 01:29:39.840
You go that way, I go this way,
we corner them.

01:29:40.016 --> 01:29:42.007
- You're in the ninth grade?
- Yes, sir.

01:29:42.184 --> 01:29:44.982
Man, you look older
than ninth grade.

01:29:45.154 --> 01:29:46.849
All right, here's my card.

01:29:47.023 --> 01:29:48.991
You ever thought about
being a Marine, man?

01:29:49.158 --> 01:29:51.490
I've thought about it.
I've got a wife and kid now.

01:29:51.661 --> 01:29:53.322
Even more reason to join up.

01:29:53.496 --> 01:29:55.123
What I want to do, man...

01:29:55.298 --> 01:29:58.324
...is get information from you
so I can scratch you off my list...

01:29:58.501 --> 01:30:02.130
...saying I've talked to you, and
you're not interested. Is that cool?

01:30:02.305 --> 01:30:04.705
What's your name? Phone number?
What's your address?

01:30:04.874 --> 01:30:06.273
Add another one to the list.

01:30:06.442 --> 01:30:11.038
However, one would love to have
that chance to experience college life.

01:30:11.213 --> 01:30:14.341
You know, stuff young people
can do without having the risk...

01:30:14.517 --> 01:30:17.782
...of dying in the process,
I guess I can say candidly.

01:30:20.056 --> 01:30:24.390
The holidays add a bit more friction,
as opposed to just another night...

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:28.724
...in the fact we wanna give our guys
a little time off, time to relax.

01:30:28.898 --> 01:30:32.857
However, we are in a combat zone,
and my soldiers do recognize that fact.

01:30:33.035 --> 01:30:36.129
Everybody's a little bit
nervous about it, I guess.

01:30:36.305 --> 01:30:39.274
We're professionals.
We're gonna take care of you.

01:30:40.343 --> 01:30:42.277
I promise.

01:30:43.412 --> 01:30:47.314
Every house here has the right
to have weapons.

01:30:47.483 --> 01:30:49.713
Maximum, one AK-47.

01:30:49.885 --> 01:30:52.752
We always expect the targets
to be armed.

01:30:59.261 --> 01:31:01.320
Rock 'n' roll.

01:31:03.165 --> 01:31:06.100
These are fucking bolt cutters.

01:31:06.268 --> 01:31:08.566
This goddamn thing
to pry doors open.

01:31:08.738 --> 01:31:10.672
Pop this in there...

01:31:47.343 --> 01:31:49.277
Hey, Adele, just hold up.

01:31:55.918 --> 01:31:57.510
No, no, no, no.

01:31:57.686 --> 01:31:59.347
Where's she going?

01:32:00.122 --> 01:32:01.851
- I'll go with her.
- Where's she going?

01:32:02.024 --> 01:32:03.286
She's gonna call him.

01:32:03.459 --> 01:32:07.327
She's gonna call him? No, no, no.
Where is he at right now?

01:32:07.496 --> 01:32:09.327
Not on the phone.
Not on the phone.

01:32:09.498 --> 01:32:12.558
Is he in the house?
Is he in the house?

01:32:12.735 --> 01:32:15.067
- Passerelli! Passerelli!
- Is he in the house?

01:32:15.237 --> 01:32:17.467
He is? He is in the house? Where?

01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:19.801
- This is him?
- Get up there, second floor!

01:32:19.975 --> 01:32:22.967
Watch out. Go, go, go!
Watch out, Adele, watch out.

01:32:23.145 --> 01:32:24.908
I have one coming up.

01:32:27.416 --> 01:32:30.010
That's Suheib Al Douri?

01:32:31.053 --> 01:32:32.782
- What's your name?
- Suheib.

01:32:32.955 --> 01:32:35.355
- This is Suheib. Yeah.
- This is Suheib.

01:32:35.524 --> 01:32:37.389
- This is Suheib?
- Yeah.

01:32:38.227 --> 01:32:40.218
Stand him up. Get up.

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:49.263
Tell them to calm down, please.
We will not be long.

01:32:53.042 --> 01:32:55.442
We appreciate your cooperation.
This is the target.

01:32:55.611 --> 01:32:58.136
Suheib Al Douri. Bring him out.

01:32:58.314 --> 01:33:00.680
We have to, as you go back
to the old saying...

01:33:00.850 --> 01:33:03.512
...win the hearts and minds
of the people. That's our job.

01:33:03.686 --> 01:33:06.849
We have to... We have to bring the...

01:33:07.022 --> 01:33:10.321
The ideal of democracy
and freedom to the country...

01:33:10.493 --> 01:33:14.224
...and show them that the American
people are not here to rule Iraq.

01:33:32.915 --> 01:33:36.681
I start doing evidence turn-in.
That process takes about three hours.

01:33:36.852 --> 01:33:38.649
So that's gonna be it for the night.

01:33:38.821 --> 01:33:41.915
That concludes Christmas Eve.

01:33:45.327 --> 01:33:47.158
Merry Christmas, PRT.
Merry Christmas.

01:33:47.329 --> 01:33:49.456
Santa came to Iraq
just for you guys.

01:33:49.632 --> 01:33:51.566
Trying to keep skies
clear for you, Santa.

01:33:54.103 --> 01:33:56.128
Do you consider yourself
a proud American?

01:33:56.305 --> 01:33:57.567
Absolutely.

01:33:57.740 --> 01:34:01.107
I'm an extremely proud American.
I'm probably more proud...

01:34:01.277 --> 01:34:02.539
...than the average Joe.

01:34:02.711 --> 01:34:06.238
When I put my flag out,
I can't allow it to touch the ground.

01:34:06.415 --> 01:34:09.873
Because I know the lives that were lost
and the blood that was shed...

01:34:10.052 --> 01:34:12.020
...so that I could be here
and have a flag.

01:34:12.188 --> 01:34:15.589
- How often do you put the flag out?
- Every single day. Every day.

01:34:15.758 --> 01:34:18.750
I started when my daughter
was in Desert Storm.

01:34:18.928 --> 01:34:20.452
I had the same flag...

01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:24.065
...flying on my front porch
and the same yellow ribbons.

01:34:24.233 --> 01:34:27.259
Praying and hoping every day
that my child would come home safe.

01:34:27.436 --> 01:34:29.461
And everybody's child
would come home safe.

01:34:29.638 --> 01:34:31.299
- And she did.
- And she did.

01:34:31.473 --> 01:34:33.703
Have other family members
been in the military?

01:34:33.876 --> 01:34:35.468
Absolutely. Uncles, aunts...

01:34:37.112 --> 01:34:38.739
...cousins, brothers, father.

01:34:38.914 --> 01:34:40.882
- Very strong military family.
- Very strong.

01:34:41.050 --> 01:34:44.281
My family was...
My family is what I consider...

01:34:44.453 --> 01:34:46.250
...part of the backbone of America.

01:34:46.422 --> 01:34:48.913
It's families like mine.
And it's not just my family.

01:34:49.091 --> 01:34:51.651
There's hundreds of families,
millions of families...

01:34:51.827 --> 01:34:54.227
...that this country was founded
on their backs.

01:34:54.396 --> 01:34:57.854
I have been known to be
a conservative Democrat. Yeah.

01:34:58.033 --> 01:35:00.092
That's what you consider
yourself? Yeah.

01:35:00.269 --> 01:35:03.602
- Yeah, it's a great country.
- It's a great country. A great country.

01:35:03.772 --> 01:35:08.573
The cross that I choose to wear
is a multicultural, multicolor cross.

01:35:08.744 --> 01:35:11.941
That's because I believe that all
God's people come in many colors.

01:35:12.114 --> 01:35:14.514
And my family itself is multicultural.

01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:18.417
You have a daughter
who went into the military.

01:35:18.587 --> 01:35:20.817
Then your first-born son,
in the military.

01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:26.451
That's quite a gift to the country
from your family.

01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:29.097
So having a son in the Army,
pretty proud thing.

01:35:29.265 --> 01:35:32.496
Oh, you know what? He made it.

01:35:33.002 --> 01:35:37.666
What was your reaction to protestors
during the Gulf War or Vietnam?

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:39.603
I always hated the protestors.

01:35:39.775 --> 01:35:43.871
I always hated the protestors.
It was just a slap in my face.

01:35:44.046 --> 01:35:48.039
It was just like they were
dishonoring my son.

01:35:48.217 --> 01:35:51.948
And I burned in my soul
to tell them, "You don't understand.

01:35:52.121 --> 01:35:54.282
They're not there because
they wanna be there."

01:35:54.456 --> 01:35:58.017
But then I came to understand
they weren't protesting the men...

01:35:58.193 --> 01:36:02.129
...and women there. They were
protesting the concept of the war.

01:36:02.298 --> 01:36:05.267
I know I'm a soldier,
and I'm here to do a job.

01:36:06.135 --> 01:36:08.763
I've been a soldier for a while.

01:36:10.139 --> 01:36:13.108
Once you have to go
and do your job...

01:36:13.275 --> 01:36:15.641
...and you see the things
that you see...

01:36:17.613 --> 01:36:20.411
...I was saying, there's some
disillusionment in that.

01:36:20.582 --> 01:36:25.019
Battalion commander fully
expects us to be...

01:36:25.187 --> 01:36:28.020
...attacked in some type of way...

01:36:28.190 --> 01:36:30.283
...before we get to FARP Shell.

01:36:31.193 --> 01:36:34.128
I know that so far
it's been pretty calm.

01:36:34.296 --> 01:36:35.661
Not much has happened.

01:36:35.831 --> 01:36:40.666
But be aware that it can,
and it probably will.

01:36:45.174 --> 01:36:48.109
They're beginning to organize
themselves, just in neighborhoods.

01:36:48.277 --> 01:36:51.644
The kids get together a lot.
Well, I can't say kids...

01:36:51.814 --> 01:36:53.338
...but guys about 17, 18...

01:36:53.515 --> 01:36:55.073
...starting to come together.

01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:57.684
They hate us.
Why, I'm not really sure.

01:37:00.422 --> 01:37:04.449
Immoral behavior
breeds immoral behavior.

01:37:05.194 --> 01:37:07.560
When a president commits
the immoral act...

01:37:07.730 --> 01:37:12.064
...of sending otherwise good kids
to war based on a lie...

01:37:12.234 --> 01:37:14.065
...this is what you get.

01:37:14.236 --> 01:37:16.727
Hey, is he ticklish?

01:37:16.905 --> 01:37:18.736
Don't tell me you don't know.

01:37:38.994 --> 01:37:42.088
To have these people
shoot at us, kill us, blow us up...

01:37:42.264 --> 01:37:44.289
...whatever, means they can.

01:37:44.466 --> 01:37:46.093
And I don't understand it.

01:37:46.268 --> 01:37:48.862
We're trying to help these people,
and it seems...

01:37:49.037 --> 01:37:51.198
...they don't want our help.
"Get out of here!"

01:37:51.373 --> 01:37:54.137
The minute something goes wrong,
"Why weren't you here?

01:37:54.309 --> 01:37:56.368
Why didn't you do this?"
You know, it's...

01:37:56.545 --> 01:37:58.570
I hate this country.

01:37:58.747 --> 01:38:02.808
You know, you... I feel
that a part of your soul...

01:38:03.685 --> 01:38:08.145
...is destroyed in taking another life.

01:38:09.558 --> 01:38:12.356
Yeah, that statement is very true.

01:38:12.528 --> 01:38:16.020
You cannot kill someone
without killing a part of yourself.

01:38:16.465 --> 01:38:17.727
If you get called up...

01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:19.731
...will you go back to Iraq?
- No.

01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:24.964
What repercussions
do you face if you don't?

01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:26.664
Possible jail time.

01:38:26.842 --> 01:38:28.309
That's one possible thing.

01:38:28.477 --> 01:38:31.139
- Are you willing to risk that?
- Yes.

01:38:31.313 --> 01:38:32.974
Yes, l...

01:38:33.148 --> 01:38:36.914
I will not let my person...

01:38:38.187 --> 01:38:41.384
I will not let anyone...

01:38:41.557 --> 01:38:44.993
...send me back over there
to kill other poor people.

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:50.792
Especially when they pose
no threat to me and my country.

01:38:54.937 --> 01:38:56.598
I won't do it.

01:38:57.606 --> 01:39:00.302
This is an impressive crowd.
The haves...

01:39:00.476 --> 01:39:02.808
...and the have-mores.

01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:07.080
Some people call you the elite.

01:39:07.249 --> 01:39:09.513
I call you my base.

01:39:17.392 --> 01:39:19.883
While Bush was busy
taking care of his base...

01:39:20.062 --> 01:39:22.257
...and professing his love
for our troops...

01:39:22.431 --> 01:39:26.561
...he proposed cutting combat
soldiers' pay by 33 percent...

01:39:26.735 --> 01:39:29.499
...and assistance to their families
by 60 percent.

01:39:30.072 --> 01:39:31.505
He opposed giving veterans...

01:39:31.673 --> 01:39:34.665
...a billion dollars more
in health-care benefits...

01:39:34.843 --> 01:39:37.903
...and he supported
closing veteran hospitals.

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:41.538
He tried to double the prescription
drug costs for veterans...

01:39:41.717 --> 01:39:45.414
...and opposed full benefits
for part-time reservists.

01:39:46.355 --> 01:39:48.755
When Staff Sergeant Brett Petriken
from Flint...

01:39:48.924 --> 01:39:51.518
...was killed in Iraq on May 26th...

01:39:51.693 --> 01:39:54.093
...the Army sent his last paycheck
to his family...

01:39:54.263 --> 01:39:57.858
...but they docked him for the last five
days of the month he didn't work...

01:39:58.033 --> 01:39:59.364
...because he was dead.

01:40:01.703 --> 01:40:04.171
They say they're not gonna leave
any veteran behind...

01:40:04.339 --> 01:40:06.739
...but they're leaving all kinds
of veterans behind.

01:40:09.244 --> 01:40:11.906
To say we're forgotten,
I know we're not. But missed? Yes.

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:14.878
Yes. There's a lot of soldiers
that have been missed...

01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:16.915
...that have been skipped over.

01:40:17.085 --> 01:40:19.144
Didn't get the proper coverage
they deserved.

01:40:19.321 --> 01:40:22.381
There's a death toll, but not
showing the injured or amputated.

01:40:25.594 --> 01:40:28.062
- I still feel like I have hands.
- Yeah.

01:40:28.230 --> 01:40:32.462
And the pain is like my hands
are being crushed in a vise.

01:40:32.634 --> 01:40:34.431
But they do a lot to help it...

01:40:34.603 --> 01:40:36.571
...and they take a lot
of the edge off it.

01:40:36.738 --> 01:40:39.605
It makes it a lot more tolerable.

01:40:40.208 --> 01:40:42.904
I was injured in late April
on patrol in Baghdad.

01:40:46.048 --> 01:40:49.347
A couple of guys come out
and ambushed us.

01:40:49.518 --> 01:40:51.952
I got nerve damage
and stuff like that.

01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:56.420
I've got a lot of pain.
I'm constantly in pain.

01:40:57.159 --> 01:40:59.184
I take a lot of morphine...

01:40:59.361 --> 01:41:02.728
...to help with that and stuff.

01:41:03.599 --> 01:41:04.930
I'm doing...

01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:07.568
Doing... You know, just readjusting.

01:41:07.736 --> 01:41:11.228
Getting life back on track.

01:41:11.406 --> 01:41:14.068
You know what I'm saying?

01:41:14.242 --> 01:41:17.302
I'm not gonna do what it is
that I did before.

01:41:18.313 --> 01:41:21.510
I was a Republican
for quite a few years.

01:41:21.683 --> 01:41:23.275
And...

01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:27.081
...for some reason, they...

01:41:29.825 --> 01:41:32.350
They conduct business
in a very dishonest way.

01:41:32.527 --> 01:41:35.360
I'm gonna be incredibly active
in the Democratic Party...

01:41:35.530 --> 01:41:38.556
...down where I live once I get out.

01:41:39.001 --> 01:41:41.060
I'm gonna definitely do my best...

01:41:41.236 --> 01:41:44.364
...to ensure that the Democrats
win control.

01:41:44.539 --> 01:41:47.508
Iraq, Baghdad, I didn't know
anything of those things.

01:41:50.445 --> 01:41:54.472
And we were in the hallway
in the upstairs of our house...

01:41:54.650 --> 01:41:57.380
...and he was crying and said
that he was really scared.

01:41:57.552 --> 01:41:59.918
And he didn't want
to have to go to Iraq.

01:42:00.088 --> 01:42:04.286
So we had a conversation about,
sometimes some fear is healthy...

01:42:04.459 --> 01:42:06.484
...because it keeps
our senses about us.

01:42:06.662 --> 01:42:08.994
That's when he told me
he hadn't told anybody else.

01:42:09.164 --> 01:42:11.359
But he knew he was going
to Baghdad.

01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:17.765
We were... As everybody,
we were glued to the TV.

01:42:17.939 --> 01:42:20.908
Just glued, completely glued
to the television...

01:42:21.076 --> 01:42:22.873
...in hopes of seeing
a glimpse of him.

01:42:23.045 --> 01:42:25.309
"Can't you please go to
where the helicopters are?

01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:27.505
Can't you please let us see him?"

01:42:27.683 --> 01:42:30.379
Then that night,
it was about 10 something...

01:42:30.552 --> 01:42:33.077
...I went upstairs to the bedroom.

01:42:33.255 --> 01:42:35.849
I was in bed, flipping the channels
with the remote.

01:42:36.024 --> 01:42:39.460
All I heard was, "Black Hawk down,
South Central Iraq."

01:42:39.628 --> 01:42:42.620
What I can tell you at this hour
is that last night...

01:42:42.798 --> 01:42:45.961
...the Army did, indeed, lose
a Black Hawk helicopter.

01:42:46.134 --> 01:42:48.694
We are being told by officers
on the ground...

01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:51.600
...that there were six occupants
inside the Black Hawk.

01:42:51.773 --> 01:42:53.900
The next morning
I got up, and I said:

01:42:54.076 --> 01:42:56.408
"You push those sad thoughts
out of your mind.

01:42:56.578 --> 01:42:58.375
Okay, Jesus,
I need you to come in.

01:42:58.547 --> 01:43:01.175
I need you, Jesus.
You gotta help me through this."

01:43:01.349 --> 01:43:04.841
The Army called me, and I remember
getting on the phone and him saying...

01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:07.955
Asking me was I Lila Lipscomb,
and I said, "Yes."

01:43:08.123 --> 01:43:11.024
And he said, "Mother of
Sergeant Michael Pedersen?"

01:43:12.661 --> 01:43:15.630
And I remember
dropping the telephone.

01:43:18.667 --> 01:43:21.397
And all I can honestly say
that I remember...

01:43:21.570 --> 01:43:24.232
...is, "Ma'am,
the United States Army...

01:43:24.406 --> 01:43:28.502
...the secretary of defense
regretfully informs you..."

01:43:30.879 --> 01:43:32.779
That's all I know.

01:43:34.015 --> 01:43:37.815
The grief grabbed me so hard...

01:43:37.986 --> 01:43:40.454
...that I literally fell on the floor.

01:43:40.622 --> 01:43:43.989
And I was alone. I didn't
have anybody to pick me up.

01:43:44.159 --> 01:43:47.925
So I literally crawled
over to my desk...

01:43:48.096 --> 01:43:49.563
...and was hanging on.

01:43:49.731 --> 01:43:52.029
And I remember screaming:

01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:54.168
"Why does it have to be Michael?

01:43:54.336 --> 01:43:59.774
Why did you have to take my son?
Why is it my son you had to take?

01:43:59.941 --> 01:44:01.841
He didn't do anything.

01:44:02.010 --> 01:44:04.740
He wasn't a bad guy.
He was a good guy.

01:44:04.913 --> 01:44:06.972
Why did you have to take my son?"

01:44:07.949 --> 01:44:10.918
l... l... l... I'm...

01:44:11.086 --> 01:44:14.146
I can't imagine what it must be like
to lose a son or a daughter...

01:44:14.322 --> 01:44:16.882
...or a husband and...
Or a wife, for that matter.

01:44:17.058 --> 01:44:19.549
And l... It pains me.

01:44:21.062 --> 01:44:22.996
Do you have his last letter?

01:44:23.165 --> 01:44:25.065
It was mailed March 16th...

01:44:25.734 --> 01:44:29.670
...but I didn't get it until probably
a week before he was killed.

01:44:30.272 --> 01:44:32.035
"Hello. Hey, Mama.

01:44:32.207 --> 01:44:35.438
Well, sorry I haven't
been able to call.

01:44:35.610 --> 01:44:37.874
They took the phone
seven days ago.

01:44:38.046 --> 01:44:40.037
I got the letter and box.

01:44:40.215 --> 01:44:44.117
That is so cool.
Your first grandson came...

01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:47.980
...the same day your oldest son did.

01:44:48.156 --> 01:44:50.556
How is everyone? I'm doing fine.

01:44:50.725 --> 01:44:54.855
We are just out here in the sand
and windstorms waiting.

01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:57.794
What in the world is wrong
with George?

01:44:57.966 --> 01:45:00.867
Trying to be like his dad, Bush.

01:45:01.036 --> 01:45:03.800
He got us out here
for nothing whatsoever.

01:45:03.972 --> 01:45:07.237
I am so furious right now, Mama.

01:45:07.976 --> 01:45:13.107
I really hope they do not
re-elect that fool, honestly.

01:45:13.281 --> 01:45:16.079
I am in good spirits,
and I am doing okay.

01:45:16.251 --> 01:45:18.014
I really miss you guys.

01:45:18.186 --> 01:45:20.154
Thanks for the Bible...

01:45:21.823 --> 01:45:24.451
...and books and candy.

01:45:24.626 --> 01:45:28.756
I really look forward to letters
from you guys.

01:45:28.930 --> 01:45:33.162
Well, tell all the family hello
and that I am doing fine.

01:45:33.335 --> 01:45:36.771
We don't expect anything
to happen any time soon.

01:45:36.938 --> 01:45:41.136
I cannot wait to get home
and get back to my life.

01:45:41.309 --> 01:45:43.436
Tell Sputnik congrats...

01:45:43.612 --> 01:45:47.275
...and I'll see my first nephew soon...

01:45:48.049 --> 01:45:50.313
...as soon as I get back
to the States.

01:45:50.919 --> 01:45:53.012
Hope you guys are doing okay...

01:45:53.188 --> 01:45:55.179
...and keep sending the mail.

01:45:55.357 --> 01:45:58.690
It makes getting through
the days easier.

01:46:01.296 --> 01:46:04.231
Well, I am on my way to bed...

01:46:04.399 --> 01:46:07.891
...so I will write you guys soon.

01:46:08.069 --> 01:46:10.196
I love and miss...

01:46:10.372 --> 01:46:12.499
...all of you guys."

01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:27.452
I want him to be alive...

01:46:27.622 --> 01:46:30.420
...and I can't make him alive.

01:46:31.493 --> 01:46:34.360
But your flesh just aches.

01:46:34.529 --> 01:46:37.020
You want your child.
It's out of sync.

01:46:37.198 --> 01:46:41.100
A parent is not supposed
to bury their child.

01:46:43.838 --> 01:46:47.774
I feel... I feel sad for my family...

01:46:47.943 --> 01:46:50.275
...because we lost our son.

01:46:51.646 --> 01:46:53.341
But...

01:46:53.515 --> 01:46:56.678
...I really feel sorry
for the other families...

01:46:56.851 --> 01:47:01.914
...that is losing their kids
as we speak.

01:47:04.159 --> 01:47:06.024
And for what?

01:47:06.194 --> 01:47:07.991
l... I don't...

01:47:09.130 --> 01:47:12.190
That's the...
I guess the sickening part.

01:47:12.367 --> 01:47:13.664
For what?

01:47:14.069 --> 01:47:16.196
You've heard a lot
about Halliburton lately.

01:47:17.806 --> 01:47:21.333
Criticism is okay. We can take it.
Criticism is not failure.

01:47:21.509 --> 01:47:23.636
Our employees are doing
a great job.

01:47:23.812 --> 01:47:26.872
We're feeding the soldiers.
We're rebuilding Iraq.

01:47:27.048 --> 01:47:30.245
Will things go wrong?
Sure they will. It's a war zone.

01:47:30.418 --> 01:47:32.886
We're serving the troops
because of what we know...

01:47:33.054 --> 01:47:34.521
...not who we know.

01:47:34.689 --> 01:47:37.749
Let me tell you about Halliburton,
the company I ran.

01:47:39.361 --> 01:47:41.192
I'm proud of what I did at Halliburton.

01:47:41.363 --> 01:47:44.526
The people are proud of what
they've accomplished. I, frankly...

01:47:44.699 --> 01:47:46.667
...don't feel any need to apologize...

01:47:46.835 --> 01:47:49.736
...for the way I've spent my time
over the last five years...

01:47:49.904 --> 01:47:52.634
...as the CEO and chairman
of a major American corporation.

01:47:52.807 --> 01:47:55.503
This is also an attempt
to divert attention...

01:47:55.677 --> 01:47:58.771
...from the fact they have
no energy policy.

01:47:58.947 --> 01:48:02.246
And as the secretary of energy said,
"We were caught unawares."

01:48:04.486 --> 01:48:09.014
In the middle of the war, Microsoft,
DHL and other corporations...

01:48:09.190 --> 01:48:11.351
...invited Halliburton
to a conference...

01:48:11.526 --> 01:48:15.326
...to figure out how much money
could be made in Iraq.

01:48:16.431 --> 01:48:18.262
Having worked this...

01:48:20.368 --> 01:48:24.566
...effort, even since before the...
The invasion...

01:48:24.739 --> 01:48:27.401
...the liberation of Iraq started.

01:48:27.575 --> 01:48:32.410
You, industry, are definitely
a vital part of that effort.

01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:35.640
We appreciate your interest
in this. We need you.

01:48:35.817 --> 01:48:37.978
Lots of you are small businesses
and struggling:

01:48:39.687 --> 01:48:42.485
"How do we get a piece of this?
You big guys are gonna get it.

01:48:42.657 --> 01:48:46.149
The rest of us will have subcontracting
capability or none at all."

01:48:46.327 --> 01:48:48.591
USTDA is for you.

01:48:48.763 --> 01:48:50.526
Once that oil starts flowing...

01:48:50.698 --> 01:48:52.757
...and money coming,
gonna be lots of money.

01:48:52.934 --> 01:48:55.334
It's the second-largest
reserve of oil in the world.

01:48:55.503 --> 01:48:57.232
No question of how much
money's there.

01:48:57.405 --> 01:49:00.374
I've been getting complaints
from Iraqi firms and American firms.

01:49:02.877 --> 01:49:04.936
The lack of transparency,
the corruption.

01:49:05.113 --> 01:49:09.812
I think the profits American companies
are making, the main companies...

01:49:09.984 --> 01:49:11.246
...are so overwhelming.

01:49:11.419 --> 01:49:14.877
I mean, when you have a line item
for a million dollars...

01:49:15.056 --> 01:49:18.253
...and you subcontract it out
for 50 or 60 or $ 70,000...

01:49:18.426 --> 01:49:19.688
...that's a huge profit.

01:49:19.861 --> 01:49:22.261
It's the American taxpayer
that's gonna pay for that.

01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:25.797
And it's gonna get better.
Start building relationships.

01:49:25.967 --> 01:49:27.798
Because it's gonna get
much better...

01:49:27.969 --> 01:49:30.369
...as the oil flows
and their budgets increase.

01:49:30.538 --> 01:49:33.371
Good news is, whatever it costs,
the government will pay you.

01:49:33.541 --> 01:49:36.374
War is always good
for certain companies...

01:49:36.544 --> 01:49:38.774
...that are in the war...
The business of war.

01:49:41.549 --> 01:49:43.107
We're very proud.

01:49:44.786 --> 01:49:46.583
Supporting U.S. government
and military.

01:49:46.754 --> 01:49:49.348
The real heroes of the campaign
and the reconstruction...

01:49:49.524 --> 01:49:51.890
...are the men and women
of the U.S. Armed Forces.

01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:54.620
We're proud of being any part
we can in supporting them.

01:49:54.796 --> 01:49:58.823
Halliburton delivers hot meals,
supplies, clean clothing...

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.491
...and communications
to our soldiers...

01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:05.901
...so they can be
a little closer to home.

01:50:07.242 --> 01:50:08.709
It's a girl!

01:50:08.877 --> 01:50:11.869
Halliburton. Proud to serve
our troops.

01:50:12.046 --> 01:50:15.447
I just read in the paper
Halliburton got another contract.

01:50:15.617 --> 01:50:18.518
- Halliburton got another contract.
- That's right.

01:50:18.686 --> 01:50:21.280
Which is not being...

01:50:22.524 --> 01:50:23.855
...contested at all.

01:50:24.025 --> 01:50:25.424
Because nobody knows.

01:50:25.593 --> 01:50:28.153
Well, it's in the paper,
so somebody knows.

01:50:28.329 --> 01:50:32.390
But that's after it happens,
after the fact. It's too late.

01:50:33.368 --> 01:50:37.498
The United States is now a major
player in the Iraqi oil business.

01:50:37.672 --> 01:50:39.765
American troops
guard the oil fields...

01:50:39.941 --> 01:50:43.035
...as Texas oil workers
assess their potential.

01:50:43.211 --> 01:50:46.772
It's a safe environment to work in.
We don't feel any risk.

01:50:46.948 --> 01:50:49.883
We feel we're being well protected
here, or we wouldn't be here.

01:50:50.051 --> 01:50:51.313
It's no secret. I mean...

01:50:51.486 --> 01:50:55.616
...I make anywhere between
2 and 3000 a month.

01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:58.020
A Halliburton employee
out here driving a bus...

01:50:58.193 --> 01:51:01.560
...can make between 8 and 10,000
a month. Explain that one to me.

01:51:01.729 --> 01:51:03.219
For 40 hours a week.

01:51:03.398 --> 01:51:05.457
Driving the same
two-and-half-mile route.

01:51:05.633 --> 01:51:06.964
Go figure.

01:51:07.135 --> 01:51:09.228
Where's the justification in that?

01:51:09.404 --> 01:51:12.339
There's no other single area
of the world today...

01:51:14.042 --> 01:51:16.442
...with the opportunity
for business, new business...

01:51:16.611 --> 01:51:19.580
...similar to the opportunity
that's available today in Iraq.

01:51:19.747 --> 01:51:21.544
The president went in,
did what he did.

01:51:23.151 --> 01:51:24.743
We're supporting him
and our troops.

01:51:24.919 --> 01:51:29.515
We wanna make sure
that the efforts and the lost lives...

01:51:29.691 --> 01:51:31.158
...wasn't for no reason.

01:51:31.326 --> 01:51:33.760
If it wasn't for the oil,
nobody would be there.

01:51:33.928 --> 01:51:35.589
Nobody would worry about it.

01:51:35.763 --> 01:51:37.788
Unfortunately,
at least for the near term...

01:51:39.734 --> 01:51:42.760
...we think it's gonna be a good
situation, a dangerous situation.

01:51:42.937 --> 01:51:45.497
Good for business,
bad for the people.

01:51:45.673 --> 01:51:49.131
Today on the news,
Rumsfeld was saying...

01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:53.246
And Wolfowitz was saying:

01:51:53.414 --> 01:51:56.941
"The Iraqi people are much,
much better off.

01:51:57.118 --> 01:52:00.212
Isn't it better that we
got rid of Saddam...

01:52:00.388 --> 01:52:04.154
...and now the Iraqi people
can do what they wanna do...

01:52:04.325 --> 01:52:06.384
...and really be free?"

01:52:06.561 --> 01:52:09.428
Will they ever be free?
No, they'll not be free.

01:52:09.597 --> 01:52:12.566
And where are the weapons
of mass destruction?

01:52:12.734 --> 01:52:15.669
It was a... We were duped.
We were really duped.

01:52:15.837 --> 01:52:17.304
And these poor people...

01:52:17.472 --> 01:52:20.703
...the young men and women
who are being killed there.

01:52:20.875 --> 01:52:22.604
- It's unnecessary.
- That's a disgrace.

01:52:22.777 --> 01:52:25.041
- That's it. No more.
- That's a disgrace.

01:52:25.213 --> 01:52:28.842
They died in a just cause,
for defending freedom...

01:52:29.017 --> 01:52:32.145
...and they will not
have died in vain.

01:52:43.364 --> 01:52:46.697
Lila had called to tell me
she was coming down from Flint...

01:52:46.868 --> 01:52:50.702
...to Washington, D. C.
to attend a jobs conference.

01:52:51.105 --> 01:52:53.471
On her break, she said
she was going to go...

01:52:53.641 --> 01:52:56.667
...and pay a visit
to the White House.

01:53:03.685 --> 01:53:06.916
Bush killed children. Iraqi children.

01:53:07.088 --> 01:53:10.956
- My son, killed.
- Killed my people in Spain, yesterday.

01:53:11.125 --> 01:53:14.788
- Lies kill people. Your children too.
- Yes, my son.

01:53:14.962 --> 01:53:17.658
They have no business to do
in Iraq now. They're killing...

01:53:17.832 --> 01:53:19.424
...all these young Americans.
- Yes.

01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:23.263
For what? For oil.
Bush is a terrorist.

01:53:23.438 --> 01:53:25.804
- No, he isn't. This is all staged.
- Yes, he is.

01:53:25.973 --> 01:53:28.168
- This is all staged.
- My son.

01:53:28.343 --> 01:53:32.211
- Where was he killed?
- You tell me my son is not a stage.

01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:34.712
- Where was he killed?
- He was killed in Karbala.

01:53:36.384 --> 01:53:40.616
April 2nd. It's not a stage.
My son is dead.

01:53:40.788 --> 01:53:43.382
There are a lot of other people too.

01:53:47.362 --> 01:53:49.387
Blame al Qaeda.

01:53:53.134 --> 01:53:55.068
What did that woman yell at you?

01:53:55.236 --> 01:53:58.467
That I'm supposed
to blame the al Qaeda.

01:53:58.639 --> 01:54:03.201
The al Qaeda didn't make a decision
to send my son to Iraq.

01:54:04.245 --> 01:54:07.772
Ignorance that we deal with,
with everyday people.

01:54:07.949 --> 01:54:10.247
Because they don't know.
People think they know...

01:54:10.418 --> 01:54:14.445
...but you don't know.
I thought I knew, but I didn't know.

01:54:19.527 --> 01:54:22.155
I need my son.

01:54:39.814 --> 01:54:42.339
God, it's tougher than I thought
it was gonna be...

01:54:42.517 --> 01:54:44.382
...to be here.

01:54:45.219 --> 01:54:46.982
But it's freeing also...

01:54:47.155 --> 01:54:49.020
...because I finally have a place...

01:54:49.190 --> 01:54:52.717
...to put all my pain
and all my anger...

01:54:52.894 --> 01:54:54.987
...and to release it.

01:55:00.468 --> 01:55:04.529
I guess I was tired of seeing people
like Lila Lipscomb suffer.

01:55:04.705 --> 01:55:09.165
Especially when, out of
the 535 members of Congress...

01:55:09.343 --> 01:55:12.801
...only one had an enlisted son
in Iraq.

01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:18.851
I asked Corporal Henderson of
the United States Marine Corps...

01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:20.885
...to join me on Capitol Hill...

01:55:21.055 --> 01:55:24.252
...to see how many members
of Congress we could convince...

01:55:24.425 --> 01:55:27.394
...to enlist their children
to go to Iraq.

01:55:27.562 --> 01:55:29.052
Congressman, I'm Michael Moore.

01:55:29.230 --> 01:55:31.494
- Hey, Michael. How are you doing?
- Good.

01:55:31.666 --> 01:55:34.430
- John Tanner, from Tennessee.
- Very nice to meet you.

01:55:34.602 --> 01:55:37.002
- What y'all doing?
- I'm here with Corporal Henderson.

01:55:37.171 --> 01:55:40.629
- United States Marine Corps.
- Corporal, I was in the Navy.

01:55:40.808 --> 01:55:43.299
- 1968 to '72.
- Okay.

01:55:43.478 --> 01:55:45.070
We had Marines guarding the base.

01:55:45.246 --> 01:55:46.508
- You have kids?
- Yeah.

01:55:46.681 --> 01:55:48.842
Is there any way we can
get them to enlist...

01:55:49.016 --> 01:55:51.416
...and go over there
and help out with the effort?

01:55:51.586 --> 01:55:54.714
- I've got all the brochures.
- One of them has got two children.

01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:59.325
See, there's not many congressmen
that have kids over there.

01:55:59.494 --> 01:56:01.724
In fact, only one. You know.

01:56:01.896 --> 01:56:04.228
So we just thought maybe they...

01:56:04.398 --> 01:56:06.832
- You guys should send your kids first.
- That's right.

01:56:07.001 --> 01:56:09.299
- What do you think about that?
- I don't disagree.

01:56:09.470 --> 01:56:12.064
You don't? Oh, good.
Well, take some brochures.

01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:14.265
- At least take a Marine brochure.
- Thank you.

01:56:14.442 --> 01:56:16.069
- Pass it around.
- Yeah, well...

01:56:16.244 --> 01:56:19.907
Encourage the fellow members
if they're for the war to get behind it.

01:56:20.081 --> 01:56:21.514
- Send their own.
- Thank you.

01:56:21.682 --> 01:56:23.980
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

01:56:25.186 --> 01:56:27.677
Congressman? Michael Moore.

01:56:27.855 --> 01:56:29.288
- How you doing today?
- Good.

01:56:29.457 --> 01:56:33.188
I'm trying to get members of Congress
to get their kids to enlist in the Army...

01:56:33.361 --> 01:56:35.556
...and go over to Iraq.

01:56:36.397 --> 01:56:37.796
Congressman.

01:56:37.965 --> 01:56:39.398
Congressman.

01:56:39.567 --> 01:56:41.797
Congressman Castle?
Congressman Castle?

01:56:41.969 --> 01:56:44.199
Congressman. Congressman.

01:56:44.372 --> 01:56:46.533
Congressman Doolittle,
Michael Moore.

01:56:46.707 --> 01:56:48.402
I was wondering if...

01:56:51.546 --> 01:56:53.275
Is there any way to...?

01:56:55.917 --> 01:56:58.044
Of course, not a single member
of Congress...

01:56:58.219 --> 01:57:01.586
...wanted to sacrifice their child
for the war in Iraq.

01:57:02.189 --> 01:57:04.054
And who could blame them?

01:57:04.225 --> 01:57:06.591
Who would wanna give up
their child?

01:57:06.761 --> 01:57:08.661
Would you?

01:57:08.829 --> 01:57:10.592
Would he?

01:57:12.433 --> 01:57:14.560
I've always been amazed
that the very people...

01:57:14.735 --> 01:57:16.896
...forced to live in the worst
parts of town...

01:57:17.438 --> 01:57:20.703
...go to the worst schools
and who have it the hardest...

01:57:20.875 --> 01:57:25.812
...are always the first to step up
to defend that very system.

01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:29.609
They serve so that
we don't have to.

01:57:29.784 --> 01:57:34.687
They offer to give up their lives
so that we can be free.

01:57:34.855 --> 01:57:38.848
It is remarkable, their gift to us.

01:57:39.026 --> 01:57:41.859
And all they ask for in return...

01:57:42.029 --> 01:57:44.793
...is that we never send them
into harm's way...

01:57:45.333 --> 01:57:48.734
...unless it's absolutely necessary.

01:57:50.204 --> 01:57:53.605
Will they ever trust us again?

01:57:53.774 --> 01:57:55.969
He had used weapons.

01:57:56.143 --> 01:57:57.371
We know where they are.

01:57:59.313 --> 01:58:01.838
Around Tikrit, Baghdad
and east, west, south and north.

01:58:02.016 --> 01:58:06.316
There is a tie between Iraq
and what happened on 9l11.

01:58:06.487 --> 01:58:08.512
The struggle can only end...

01:58:08.689 --> 01:58:11.556
...with their complete
and permanent destruction.

01:58:11.726 --> 01:58:15.492
We wage a war to save
civilization itself.

01:58:16.831 --> 01:58:18.890
We did not seek it.

01:58:19.634 --> 01:58:23.365
But we will fight it,
and we will prevail.

01:58:23.537 --> 01:58:25.562
George Orwell once wrote...

01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:30.507
...that, "It's not a matter of whether
the war is not real or if it is.

01:58:30.678 --> 01:58:32.976
Victory is not possible.

01:58:34.048 --> 01:58:39.509
The war is not meant to be won.
It is meant to be continuous.

01:58:39.687 --> 01:58:42.247
A hierarchical society
is only possible...

01:58:42.423 --> 01:58:45.290
...on the basis of poverty
and ignorance.

01:58:46.093 --> 01:58:48.561
This new version is the past...

01:58:48.729 --> 01:58:51.220
...and no different past
can ever have existed.

01:58:53.167 --> 01:58:55.761
In principle, the war effort
is always planned...

01:58:55.936 --> 01:58:59.167
...to keep society
on the brink of starvation.

01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:03.640
The war is waged by the ruling group
against its own subjects.

01:59:03.811 --> 01:59:08.942
And its object is not the victory
over either Eurasia or East Asia...

01:59:09.116 --> 01:59:13.348
...but to keep the very
structure of society intact."

01:59:13.521 --> 01:59:15.455
There's an old saying
in Tennessee.

01:59:15.623 --> 01:59:17.614
I know it's in Texas,
probably in Tennessee.

01:59:17.792 --> 01:59:19.419
Fool me once...

01:59:20.161 --> 01:59:21.958
...shame on...

01:59:22.963 --> 01:59:24.897
Shame on you.

01:59:27.234 --> 01:59:29.225
You fool me,
we can't get fooled again.

01:59:29.403 --> 01:59:31.598
For once, we agreed.
