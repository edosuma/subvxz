go to a motel.

You talked to her
today, didn't you?
What did you tell her?

05:08.142 --> 05:11.100
Told her not to go to Odessa.
Told her to stay home. Why?

05:11.187 --> 05:13.303

you, Mr. Petrelli.

was quite legitimate.

Perhaps there's
a reason for that.

Of course you are.

36:52.503 --> 36:56.371
Mr. Petrelli, it's late.
You need your rest.

36:56.465 --> 36:59.798
Can't you see
I'm in the middle
of a heated game?

37:01.428 --> 37:03.259
You're playing yourself?

37:06.350 --> 37:08.306
I'm obviously
playing Mister...

37:12.189 --> 37:16.228
She can't see me,
Nathan. No one can.
Exceptyou.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.236
Did I not mention that?

37:23.659 --> 37:26.947
Now, whose turn
was it again?

37:34.044 --> 37:36.877
MR. BENNET:
Some people are just evil.
That's their nature.

37:36.964 --> 37:38.204
His name is Knox.

37:38.298 --> 37:43.167
He can absorb a person's
fear and turn it into his own
strength. Incredible strength.

37:43.262 --> 37:45.594
This guy is a flamethrower.

37:45.681 --> 37:49.299
We call this guy the German.
He can control
magnetic energy.

37:49.393 --> 37:50.803
And this guy, Jesse.

37:52.563 --> 37:56.226
You don't want to know.
Let's just say
they could destroy us all.

37:58.068 --> 38:01.401
You know,
even before you
were ever born,

38:02.197 --> 38:04.233
I've been finding
these people and
locking them away

38:04.324 --> 38:07.487
so they can't do any harm.
And now, a dozen of them
have escaped.

38:08.662 --> 38:10.072
They're out there.

38:10.581 --> 38:15.245
And they will kill,
and they will terrorize,
and they will conspire.

38:15.335 --> 38:18.953
And they will cause
unimaginable destruction
to the world.

38:20.883 --> 38:22.464
They're villains, Claire.

38:24.052 --> 38:26.134
And right now,
I'm one of the only
people on the planet

38:26.221 --> 38:27.961
that knows enough
to stop them.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.594
That's why I can't stay.

38:33.729 --> 38:37.392
Then let me come with you.
I can be your partner.

38:37.483 --> 38:39.439
Claire.
I can help.

38:39.526 --> 38:43.189
I helped save New York City.
You were there. You saw it.

38:43.280 --> 38:46.864
I was willing to shoot
Peter with your gun
when you couldn't do it.

38:46.950 --> 38:49.657
That's exactly
the kind of situation
I can't put you in again.

38:49.745 --> 38:52.578
I am doing this
so you don't have to.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.280
And what if somebody
comes here?

38:55.375 --> 38:58.208
What if somebody comes
after me and Mom and Lyle?

38:58.295 --> 38:59.660
I've thought about that.

39:01.423 --> 39:04.165
And I've called
someone to help out
while I'm gone.

39:06.011 --> 39:09.128
What's going on?
You have a lot
of questions, Claire.

39:09.223 --> 39:12.340
As adoptive parents,
there's only so many
we can answer.

39:17.064 --> 39:18.600
Mom?

39:18.690 --> 39:23.480
She's here to make sure
you all stay safe.
You're in good hands.

39:43.298 --> 39:44.629
Sylar.

39:51.640 --> 39:54.632
What are you doing here?
(SNARLING) Where is he?

39:54.726 --> 39:56.887
Where did they go?
Escaped.

39:58.647 --> 40:00.558
That's not possible.
Thatneverhappened!

40:00.649 --> 40:03.356
It's the butterfly effect,
Peter. Just like I told you.

40:03.443 --> 40:05.604
I put him here
to keep him safe.

40:05.696 --> 40:09.234
(SHOUTING) I put him in
the body of the guy in
that cell, right there.

40:09.324 --> 40:10.655
Jesse?

40:11.660 --> 40:14.527
You're gonna figure out where
my son is, and you're gonna
bring him back here.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.657
You understand me?

40:16.748 --> 40:19.615
And then go the hell back
where you came from!

40:20.419 --> 40:22.626
This is Nathan Petrelli.
Leave a message.

40:22.713 --> 40:25.921
Nathan, I don't even
know if you're alive
or not, but if you get this,

40:26.008 --> 40:28.420
you need to look out
for someone who looks
just like me.

40:30.262 --> 40:33.095
He's got a scar on
his face, and I think
it's me from the...

40:33.181 --> 40:34.717
Come on,
our ride is here.

40:39.855 --> 40:41.220
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

40:44.067 --> 40:45.056
(GROANS)

40:54.786 --> 40:55.775
(SHUSHING)

41:00.792 --> 41:02.293
What are you doing?

41:02.377 --> 41:04.538
Just having
a little fun, that's all.

41:18.393 --> 41:19.553
(ENGINE STARTING)

41:19.645 --> 41:20.885
(HONMNG)

41:21.355 --> 41:23.846
You coming?
It's now or never.

41:46.046 --> 41:47.582
(DOOR OPENING)

41:59.267 --> 42:02.054
My sons have been
such a disappointment.

42:03.397 --> 42:08.937
But you, I can give you
what all boys crave
from their mothers.

42:09.528 --> 42:13.692
Inspiration and
guidance, comfort.

42:14.324 --> 42:15.985
Isn't that right, Gabriel?

42:19.121 --> 42:20.782
My name is Sylar.

42:22.165 --> 42:23.951
And you are not my mother.

42:27.963 --> 42:31.455
But I am, dear. I am.
