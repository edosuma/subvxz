put yourself out to pasture, wasn't it?

he plumb outdrew me...

12:41.133 --> 12:43.647
...and left me for dead
with a gut shot.

could be so fast.

on that one, Sam.

in every train. They got dogs.

20:31.173 --> 20:32.447
Well, we got most of it.

20:33.413 --> 20:35.688
- Much obliged, Bo.
- Anytime.

20:35.853 --> 20:37.650
Yeah, Bo.

20:49.173 --> 20:51.846
No. No, Sam.

20:52.013 --> 20:54.049
You tell me, now.

20:58.173 --> 21:01.290
No, Zach Provo's yours.
You can have him.

21:02.133 --> 21:03.725
Funny thing.

21:04.093 --> 21:06.288
I quit the law...

21:07.853 --> 21:09.889
...because I thought it was over.

21:10.453 --> 21:13.047
What I knew how to do.

21:13.213 --> 21:15.647
Too much was changing.

21:16.533 --> 21:18.410

21:18.733 --> 21:21.327
I liked the world the way it was.

21:22.093 --> 21:24.607
Now it's coming back.

You know, if you was to get married
to that Hal fella...

22:07.653 --> 22:10.531
...you wouldn't have
to cook supper for me no more.

22:11.053 --> 22:14.090
I'd have to cook supper for him anyway,
so, what's the difference?

22:14.253 --> 22:16.767
And what makes you think
I wanna get married?

22:17.173 --> 22:21.371
You mean to tell me I'm gonna be
stuck with you for the rest of my life?

22:34.813 --> 22:37.452
I try to imagine how it would be.

22:38.373 --> 22:40.329

that when you'd walk into a saloon...

to get out of your way.

No more. Time's changing.

Some days you wonder
where it all went.

23:24.413 --> 23:25.812
It's true, then?

23:28.573 --> 23:30.370
I heard.

23:30.533 --> 23:32.808
Are you going to get into it?

23:33.933 --> 23:36.447
- I am into it.
- You retired.

23:37.053 --> 23:38.566
This is just a loose end.

23:39.453 --> 23:41.171
No, it isn't.

23:42.373 --> 23:45.331
- Do you have to go?
- Yes.

23:45.493 --> 23:46.812
Why?

23:46.973 --> 23:50.249
Because I never knew
how to do anything else. Look...

23:50.813 --> 23:52.565
Honey, there's a man
coming for me.

23:52.733 --> 23:56.009
I can't just sit there on the couch
and then wait for him.

23:56.173 --> 23:57.447
Well, who? What kind of man?

23:57.613 --> 24:02.368
Oh, a fellow named Provo
I put in Yuma prison a long time ago.

24:03.213 --> 24:05.443
He's half Injun, all killer.

24:06.013 --> 24:07.651
He wants to kill you. Why?

24:07.813 --> 24:11.203
I reckon he's always been more than
happy to kill any man wearing a badge.

24:11.373 --> 24:14.604
But I gave him cause to remember me.
Hey, what about my supper?

24:14.773 --> 24:16.365
I'm not a little girl anymore.

24:18.533 --> 24:20.046

Well, it was his last job.

24:22.573 --> 24:26.122
Blew up a Santa Fe express train,
blew up four guards along with it.

24:26.293 --> 24:29.091
We tracked him for four weeks.

24:29.293 --> 24:33.411
Found him, finally, holed up in a hogan
down Salinas Springs way.

24:33.613 --> 24:37.765
We had to shoot
the hell out of the place.

24:37.933 --> 24:40.163
I was the first one in.

24:40.573 --> 24:43.371
Kicked through the doors,
still shooting.

He was all finished.

24:47.333 --> 24:51.246

looking up at me.

24:51.693 --> 24:53.570
There was his woman.

- I still don't understand.
- She was dead.

- Killed in the shootout.
- Why didn't you ever tell me?

Well, it sure wasn't nothing
to brag about.

25:08.493 --> 25:10.245
You killed her?

25:12.373 --> 25:14.011
Maybe.

25:14.693 --> 25:16.888
No way to tell.
Provo surely thought so.

25:17.053 --> 25:18.884
You can't blame him for that.

25:20.293 --> 25:21.567
Does he have a chance?

26:37.653 --> 26:40.213
..."always nice to see you"
supposed to mean?

He never said
anything like that before.

from behind that desk, Noel?

38:30.853 --> 38:33.162
You're not gonna trip up
the likes of Zach Provo...

38:33.333 --> 38:36.052
...with a big-city telephone wire.

38:36.213 --> 38:38.249
He is on horseback.

38:38.413 --> 38:41.450
To get him, you're gonna have to
get on a horse and track him.

38:41.613 --> 38:44.685
The longer you sit talking about it,
the farther he's gonna get.

38:44.893 --> 38:46.724
What's wrong with
calling the governor...

38:46.893 --> 38:50.772
...and requesting help from the Army?
Surround this Provo with 1000 troops.

38:50.973 --> 38:53.567
He'd slip through them at night
and be long gone...

38:53.733 --> 38:56.691
...while you're still trying
to figure out how he did it.

38:57.573 --> 39:00.770
You think he's just some
raggedy-ass half-breed, don't you?

39:01.093 --> 39:05.962
Well, I have to tell you
he beat me here, on my own ground.

39:06.133 --> 39:09.364
Go on, send a telegram to Phoenix.
Try it.

39:09.573 --> 39:11.768
I'll bet you $ 100
he's already cut the wire.

Hello, Millie? This is Noel. Noel!

Yeah, I'll wait. I'll wait.

39:32.773 --> 39:35.412
I'll tell you where Provo's headed.
He's northbound.

39:35.573 --> 39:37.006
I'm pretty sure where to.

39:38.893 --> 39:40.611
You all do what you want.

39:40.773 --> 39:43.333
I'm gonna get myself provisioned
and get in his track...

39:43.493 --> 39:46.053
...and I'm gonna stay there
till I get my daughter back.

39:46.213 --> 39:49.444
And then I'm gonna kill him
and every son of a bitch with him.

39:52.693 --> 39:58.370
I've got no authority no more
to call out a posse...

39:58.693 --> 40:01.253

40:05.933 --> 40:07.286
Yeah.

40:07.453 --> 40:09.171
Yeah, Bo.

40:11.093 --> 40:13.163

had a tiebar shoe.

- More than likely to hold a soft hoof.
- They went on up the canyon, all right.

42:35.653 --> 42:38.167
They ain't making pains
about covering up their tracks.

42:38.893 --> 42:40.963

and this little girl.

till he makes a stand.

He might even think we're lost.

anything else to live for.

01:19:38.289 --> 01:19:40.325
Hey, they're burning us out!

01:19:42.009 --> 01:19:43.886
They're burning us out!

01:19:44.889 --> 01:19:46.607
The fire, it's coming up
the mountain.

01:19:46.769 --> 01:19:49.886
MENENDEZ: Shiraz, get the horses.
Gant, get the other blanket.

01:19:50.049 --> 01:19:52.040
SHELBY:
I'll get the girl.

01:20:02.809 --> 01:20:04.765
Menendez!

01:20:04.929 --> 01:20:07.397
No, not that way.
The horses are down here.

01:20:07.609 --> 01:20:09.327
Not today, amigo.

01:20:22.169 --> 01:20:23.727
He's coming.

01:20:23.889 --> 01:20:26.403
The son of a bitch is coming.

01:20:27.929 --> 01:20:29.487
Shelby.

01:20:46.289 --> 01:20:47.688
Run, Susie!

01:20:47.889 --> 01:20:49.527
- Get away from her, kid.
(GUN COCKS)

01:20:49.729 --> 01:20:52.368
Run, Susie! Run to the right!

01:20:52.569 --> 01:20:53.763
Get away from her, kid.

01:23:59.729 --> 01:24:01.560
(GUNSHOT)

01:24:01.729 --> 01:24:05.005
I lost the damn bastard in the rocks.

01:24:05.809 --> 01:24:07.765
SHELBY: He's gonna chase us
all the way to Canada.

01:24:08.169 --> 01:24:10.478
Nobody can chase you
if you don't run, kid.

01:24:10.649 --> 01:24:14.164
Listen, amigo. You go down there
behind those rocks. I'll stay up here.

01:24:14.369 --> 01:24:17.167
We'll catch him in a crossfire
when he comes up, huh?

01:24:30.169 --> 01:24:31.682
(GUN COCKS)

01:24:31.849 --> 01:24:33.168
There he is.

01:24:41.129 --> 01:24:43.245
Why didn't you shoot him?

01:24:47.369 --> 01:24:49.837
I can almost see that gold from here.

01:24:50.289 --> 01:24:52.120
Listen, kid, see that rock over there?

01:24:52.289 --> 01:24:55.281
Look. See that rock?

01:24:55.489 --> 01:24:57.798
At the base of that rock
is an old oak tree.

01:24:58.289 --> 01:25:03.443
Fifty paces north
is where all that gold's buried.

01:25:08.649 --> 01:25:11.083
Now, you take your girl...

01:25:11.649 --> 01:25:14.527
...and go down
on the back side of this hill...

01:25:14.689 --> 01:25:19.080
...in them rocks, and you wait.

01:25:19.889 --> 01:25:22.198
Think about all that gold.

01:25:22.369 --> 01:25:24.280
Now move, go on.

(GRUNTING)

01:26:37.369 --> 01:26:39.724
If you'd come over that ridge
five minutes ago...

01:26:39.889 --> 01:26:42.005
...you would be a dead man.

01:26:43.129 --> 01:26:45.279
Down below,
I saw the ones you killed.

01:26:46.729 --> 01:26:48.401
There's only two of them left.

01:26:49.049 --> 01:26:52.200
Provo and the kid,
up there with Susan.

01:26:58.849 --> 01:27:00.567
That's Menendez.

01:27:06.689 --> 01:27:09.886
- You got it straight now?
- Yes, sir.

01:27:11.209 --> 01:27:13.723
Well, I think I ought to be
the one to go up there.

01:27:14.609 --> 01:27:16.759
Appreciate the offer.

01:27:17.649 --> 01:27:20.209
But this is the way
I used to make my living.

01:27:21.129 --> 01:27:23.165
Give me 15...

01:27:23.329 --> 01:27:24.887
Better make it 20 minutes.

01:27:25.049 --> 01:27:26.846
It's a mighty rough hill.

01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:31.243
Remember, three shots,
then get that horse going.

This is gonna take a long time.

01:29:42.129 --> 01:29:43.687
Drop it.

01:29:48.169 --> 01:29:49.648
Drop it.
