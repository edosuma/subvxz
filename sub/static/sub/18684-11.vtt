00:18.597 --> 00:21.031
Yeah, I just got off
the bus, girlfriend.

00:21.067 --> 00:23.800
Getting closer...

00:33.645 --> 00:36.045
Told you so; a million coins!

00:40.018 --> 00:41.751
Getting closer.

01:03.908 --> 01:05.608
Excusez-moi.

01:05.643 --> 01:06.942
Treasure Hunter?

01:06.977 --> 01:08.727
Sorry, chÃ©rie, got to go.

01:09.480 --> 01:11.046
Is he with you?

01:11.081 --> 01:13.348
Him? No.

01:14.956 --> 01:17.130
Okay, don't mean to be impolite, but...

01:56.592 --> 01:57.724
Hey!

01:57.760 --> 01:59.860
It is a million coins, you know!

02:10.305 --> 02:11.605
Oh, come on.

02:11.640 --> 02:14.107
Sorry, ladies. Snooze, you lose.

02:14.142 --> 02:15.480
Hey!

02:21.416 --> 02:23.483
I just lost service!

02:23.518 --> 02:26.486
- Yeah, me, too.
- Yeah, I think we all did.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.355
Serves you right, you Wanker.

02:30.325 --> 02:32.993
- What was that?
- The door.

02:44.305 --> 02:45.872
It's locked.

02:45.907 --> 02:47.249
The window.

02:50.407 --> 02:51.872
I mean, it's obviously part of the game.

02:51.908 --> 02:53.692
I don't think so.

02:56.913 --> 02:59.613
Hey! Let us out!

02:59.648 --> 03:01.916
Don't try to escape.

03:01.951 --> 03:05.986
- This is cool.
- No. This is bad.

03:08.457 --> 03:10.490
Who are you?

03:10.526 --> 03:15.228
The guilty must
confess or everyone dies.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.501
Guys, over here!

03:24.439 --> 03:27.206
Don't try to leave.

03:27.242 --> 03:28.574
Didn't you hear what he said?

03:28.609 --> 03:30.643
Guys, this is a really bad idea.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.645
He can see us. You should stay.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.213
I'll come back with help.

03:34.249 --> 03:35.776
Be careful.

03:50.097 --> 03:52.665
Yeah. I'm going too.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.702
He killed him.

04:16.399 --> 04:17.519
_

04:17.553 --> 04:19.553
_

04:33.739 --> 04:35.439
Doesn't look much like a game.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.141
It's all too real.

04:37.176 --> 04:39.610
We understand the castle
and grounds are wired to blow.

04:39.645 --> 04:41.212
So he claims.

04:41.247 --> 04:44.215
The police can't get close
enough to verify that,

04:44.250 --> 04:46.450
- or the fatality he reported.
- Why not?

04:46.486 --> 04:48.184
He says he'll kill all the hostages

04:48.220 --> 04:50.186
if he even sees a uniform.

04:50.222 --> 04:52.022
So the police are keeping
their distance.

04:52.057 --> 04:54.224
- At least until nightfall.
- If that player isn't dead,

04:54.259 --> 04:55.959
he could be out there bleeding to death.

04:55.995 --> 04:58.094
A chopper scanned the trees
for a heat signature.

04:58.130 --> 04:59.257
No one's alive down there.

04:59.298 --> 05:01.198
Okay. What happens at nightfall?

05:01.233 --> 05:03.432
A tactical unit ends this.
One way or another.

05:03.468 --> 05:05.201
That gives us six hours.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

05:37.550 --> 05:38.677
I don't know.

05:38.712 --> 05:40.879
We're still waiting
for more information.

05:40.915 --> 05:42.247
Look, as soon as I know something,

05:42.282 --> 05:43.982
you'll know something, okay.

05:44.017 --> 05:45.651
Look, I'll-I'll call you back, okay?

05:45.686 --> 05:48.754
This is Gavin Nichols,
Senior VP with Zama Corp.

05:48.789 --> 05:51.457
- The company that made the game.
- What a nightmare.

05:51.492 --> 05:53.592
One customer dead,
four more trapped inside.

05:53.627 --> 05:57.628
- All playing Treasure Hunter?
- No. Technically, yes.

05:57.664 --> 05:59.230
But we never had a trail
that lead up here.

05:59.266 --> 06:01.599
What they saw on their phones,
the treasure map

06:01.634 --> 06:03.601
with a million-coin payout,
that wasn't us.

06:03.636 --> 06:05.437
Gavin believes the game was hacked.

06:05.472 --> 06:08.006
To lure them here from
a Treasure Hunter convention

06:08.041 --> 06:10.141
in Cannes. Shall we?

06:10.177 --> 06:11.676
There are thousands
of players at that convention,

06:11.711 --> 06:14.345
- Mr. Nichols, why these five?
- I have no clue.

06:14.380 --> 06:15.713
Well, we'll need to know
the players' names.

06:15.748 --> 06:17.482
We've notified their parents.

06:17.517 --> 06:19.083
They're all on their way here now.

06:19.118 --> 06:20.376
Very good.

06:20.411 --> 06:23.153
The insurance company has
set up a command post for us.

06:25.458 --> 06:27.892
Do you mind giving us
your take on this, Mr. Nichols?

06:27.927 --> 06:30.327
Look, we are the number
one augmented reality game

06:30.363 --> 06:32.396
in the world. We're a billion
dollar company

06:32.431 --> 06:34.831
with millions of players
in 57 countries.

06:34.867 --> 06:38.602
So that makes us a target. But this...

06:38.637 --> 06:41.505
we haven't even received a ransom.

06:41.540 --> 06:42.739
Zama Corp's insurance

06:42.774 --> 06:44.941
provides for a ransom
of up to $10 million.

06:44.977 --> 06:46.477
If he was gonna ask Zama Corp to pay,

06:46.512 --> 06:48.111
you would have received a demand by now.

06:48.146 --> 06:50.079
- How do you know that?
- Pulling something like this

06:50.115 --> 06:51.948
took months of preparation.

06:51.984 --> 06:54.183
We're looking at an extremely
organized personality.

06:54.219 --> 06:56.419
So he's just gonna kill all those kids?

06:56.454 --> 06:58.588
The abductor has demonstrated
a willingness to kill,

06:58.624 --> 07:00.023
but he wouldn't go to all this trouble

07:00.058 --> 07:01.791
if that was his only purpose.

07:01.827 --> 07:03.893
We are already exposed on this thing.

07:03.928 --> 07:06.129
If the police get another one
of those kids killed...

07:06.164 --> 07:08.564
We will bring this to an end,
Mr. Nichols.

07:08.599 --> 07:10.950
Without violence. Okay?

07:15.840 --> 07:17.473
Is he really that good?

07:18.270 --> 07:20.308
He doesn't like to lose, Mr. Nichols.

07:21.712 --> 07:24.513
I keep restarting it,
but still... nothing.

07:24.549 --> 07:26.048
You're wasting your time.

07:26.083 --> 07:28.050
He must have a jammer or something.

07:28.085 --> 07:30.318
Help!

07:30.354 --> 07:32.588
Somebody please!

07:32.623 --> 07:34.757
I don't think that's going
to do any good either.

07:34.792 --> 07:36.224
Why not?

07:36.260 --> 07:38.193
You've heard those helicopters?

07:38.228 --> 07:40.628
The police must be here,
but they're not coming.

07:40.664 --> 07:43.731
- Why?
- Might be too dangerous.

07:47.471 --> 07:48.803
Hey.

07:50.441 --> 07:52.294
You okay?

07:52.709 --> 07:54.842
I've never seen anybody die before.

07:55.245 --> 07:56.678
Me neither.

07:56.713 --> 07:59.213
You were right, he shouldn't have run.

07:59.248 --> 08:00.648
There must be some way out of here.

08:01.238 --> 08:02.817
Are you crazy?!

08:03.165 --> 08:04.686
Do you wanna end up like the other guy?

08:04.721 --> 08:07.055
I don't intend to sit here
doing nothing.

08:07.090 --> 08:10.091
- All this for a million coins.
- Yeah.

08:10.489 --> 08:13.060
My friend said
it was too good to be true.

08:13.096 --> 08:15.796
I'm Camille, by the way.
Camille Lambert.

08:15.831 --> 08:18.466
- Boyd Ferguson.
- Britta Mauer.

08:18.501 --> 08:20.801
My name's Simon Holman,
but I don't plan on

08:20.836 --> 08:23.194
sticking around long enough
to get to know any of you.

08:24.175 --> 08:26.707
I just don't understand why
any of this is happening.

08:26.742 --> 08:29.076
He wants the guilty to confess.

08:29.111 --> 08:31.044
Confess to what? He's toying with us.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.746
No!

08:32.780 --> 08:35.315
There must be a reason the five
of us were brought here.

08:35.350 --> 08:36.883
Four of us now.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.019
No one else tries to escape

08:39.054 --> 08:41.221
- or you all die.
- How?

08:46.961 --> 08:49.028
I think I can guess.

08:56.605 --> 08:58.338
The police haven't recovered the body

08:58.373 --> 09:00.072
because of the threat
to kill the hostages,

09:00.108 --> 09:02.307
but we believe it to be Logan Smythe.

09:02.897 --> 09:04.910
He just turned 18 last month.

09:05.407 --> 09:06.946
Worked part-time at Razorwire,

09:06.981 --> 09:09.615
a software firm
specializing in fire walls.

09:09.651 --> 09:11.383
His parents must be devastated.

09:11.418 --> 09:14.286
I'm sure they will be,
they're in Singapore.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.088
The game company hasn't been
able to contact them yet.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.291
Camille Lambert, 19.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.626
Lives in Paris.

09:20.661 --> 09:24.563
Simon Holman, 19, studies
engineering in Manchester.

09:24.598 --> 09:27.299
Boyd Ferguson, 18, high-school student

09:27.334 --> 09:28.767
from Boise, Idaho.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.335
And Britta Mauer, 20,

09:30.371 --> 09:32.270
personal trainer from Berlin.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.205
And what is the connection?

09:34.639 --> 09:37.742
Other than playing
Treasure Hunter? None.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.678
The abductor called the police

09:39.713 --> 09:41.746
and gave them the names
of his hostages, right?

09:41.782 --> 09:43.715
- That's right.
- So...

09:43.750 --> 09:46.517
he knew this would be public.
He wanted it to be.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.452
But he's staying hidden.

09:48.975 --> 09:50.221
Well, he'll have eyes on his hostages.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.290
See if you can locate a WiFi blackspot.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.292
Some kind of closed circuit feed.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.826
Oliver. Okay. Will do.

09:55.861 --> 09:57.495
Eric, the parents have arrived.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.830
Ah, okay. Maxine,
why don't you come with us?

09:59.865 --> 10:01.265
Sure.

10:07.506 --> 10:09.372
Hi folks, sorry to keep you.

10:09.408 --> 10:11.742
My name is Eric Beaumont,
I'm a professional negotiator.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.844
This is my second, Maxine Carlson.

10:13.879 --> 10:15.478
You've already met Nathalie Denard.

10:15.514 --> 10:17.781
You work for Treasure Hunter?

10:17.817 --> 10:19.616
I'm employed by their insurance company.

10:19.651 --> 10:21.685
- Is it, Mrs. Mauer?
- Yeah, it is.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.920
To make sure your children
get out of this safely.

10:23.955 --> 10:26.055
And that we don't sue
the arses off them.

10:26.091 --> 10:27.691
We'd like to know what you intend to do

10:27.726 --> 10:30.227
to rescue our children, Mr. Beaumont.

10:30.262 --> 10:31.894
It's Mr. and Mrs. Lambert, from Paris.

10:31.930 --> 10:33.096
Yes.

10:33.131 --> 10:34.831
Okay. So you must be
Jane Ferguson from Idaho.

10:34.866 --> 10:36.132
Boise. Yes.

10:36.167 --> 10:38.868
My son talked me into taking
him to this convention.

10:38.903 --> 10:40.269
Well, to answer your question,

10:40.304 --> 10:43.539
what we first need to establish
is why the abductor

10:43.574 --> 10:45.307
has drawn your children here.

10:45.343 --> 10:48.177
He's a nutter, isn't that obvious?

10:48.213 --> 10:49.278
Possibly.

10:49.879 --> 10:51.214
But even emotionally disturbed people

10:51.249 --> 10:55.117
have reasons for their actions,
Mr. Holman. I'm assuming?

10:56.454 --> 10:57.786
Well, well, well...

10:58.255 --> 10:59.421
Got something?

10:59.457 --> 11:01.089
The electrical system has been engaged

11:01.125 --> 11:02.991
to lock the doors and windows.

11:03.026 --> 11:04.627
What happens if the police knock it out?

11:04.662 --> 11:06.629
No. They'd still have to get
past those explosives outside

11:06.664 --> 11:08.631
without their using their
phones to guide them.

11:08.666 --> 11:11.399
But there is something else...

11:13.436 --> 11:16.638
A power feed, going to
a satellite transmitter.

11:16.673 --> 11:19.641
This will lead us
to the location of the voice.

11:19.676 --> 11:23.278
Oliver Yates, you are a man
of many talents.

11:25.249 --> 11:26.414
Yeah.

11:27.484 --> 11:29.917
They said one young man is dead.

11:29.952 --> 11:31.919
I'm afraid so.

11:31.954 --> 11:34.088
This is just awful.

11:34.123 --> 11:36.357
The perpetrator claims
he's hidden explosives

11:36.393 --> 11:37.925
on the ground.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.728
Until they're cleared,
we can't recover his body.

11:40.764 --> 11:42.530
Now, I understand it's difficult,

11:42.565 --> 11:44.464
but we're looking for a connection.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.300
Now we have confirmed that he,
like your children,

11:46.335 --> 11:48.235
played Treasure Hunter. A lot.

11:48.271 --> 11:51.138
Last I heard, millions of
people play that stupid game.

11:51.174 --> 11:53.507
And now someone is dead because of it.

11:53.542 --> 11:55.509
There has to be a connection
between your children,

11:55.544 --> 11:58.312
- Mr. Holman.
- And how can there be?

11:58.347 --> 12:00.314
We all live in different countries.

12:00.349 --> 12:02.215
We've never even been to Europe before.

12:02.991 --> 12:05.051
Sorry to interrupt.

12:05.086 --> 12:06.252
We're doing everything we can

12:06.288 --> 12:08.527
to get them out of there safely.
Excuse us.

12:11.527 --> 12:14.628
Oliver got it a live feed
coming from the castle.

12:14.663 --> 12:16.630
Can you track where the feed goes?

12:16.665 --> 12:18.832
I'm working on it.
The video feed is scrambled,

12:18.867 --> 12:22.101
but I'm tapping into the audio... now.

12:24.072 --> 12:25.839
This isn't a game.

12:25.874 --> 12:29.175
You want a confession?
Tell us the crime!

12:29.757 --> 12:31.610
The abductor wants a confession.

12:32.150 --> 12:34.480
This is like straight out
of an Agatha Christie novel.

12:34.515 --> 12:36.915
Or more like Kernel Mustard
in a library.

12:36.951 --> 12:38.250
You're dating yourself, Hallam,

12:38.285 --> 12:39.918
kids don't play board games anymore.

12:39.954 --> 12:41.702
Yeah. Or read novels.

12:43.691 --> 12:46.000
Why the hell doesn't he answer?

12:46.761 --> 12:50.795
Because he wants us to figure
it out for ourselves.

12:50.831 --> 12:53.765
Come on, somebody here
must know something.

12:54.537 --> 12:56.854
Are you Camille De Clichy?

12:57.304 --> 12:58.590
Yes.

13:00.207 --> 13:03.208
- And you're...
- Oya47.

13:03.244 --> 13:05.277
These are their online names.

13:05.312 --> 13:07.278
BigBadBoyd36.

13:07.313 --> 13:11.349
Shogun Seifuku-sha, at your service.

13:12.853 --> 13:14.986
Who's not here?

13:15.021 --> 13:17.355
Phoenix718.

13:18.992 --> 13:21.158
They all know who that is.

13:22.429 --> 13:24.828
Is he the one you just blew up outside?

13:24.864 --> 13:26.931
I couldn't kill Phoenix718,

13:26.966 --> 13:29.233
because he's already dead.

13:29.269 --> 13:33.037
He killed himself because of
what one of you did to him.

13:34.473 --> 13:36.774
Oh, this isn't about the game at all.

13:36.809 --> 13:38.675
It's about revenge.

13:52.923 --> 13:55.924
Even though they didn't know
each other's faces or voices,

13:55.960 --> 13:57.860
it seems that your children
do know each other.

13:57.895 --> 13:59.761
"Shogun Seifukusha"?

14:01.532 --> 14:04.700
The name your son uses
in chatrooms, Mr. Holman.

14:04.735 --> 14:06.835
I'm sorry, I don't know
what a chatroom is.

14:06.871 --> 14:09.337
It's a website where people
who play the game meet

14:09.373 --> 14:10.672
to message one another.

14:10.708 --> 14:12.508
We've been able to determine
that all of your children

14:12.543 --> 14:14.676
frequented the same chatroom,

14:14.712 --> 14:16.678
which has been active for sometime.

14:16.714 --> 14:19.981
- To talk about the game.
- Not just the game. Um...

14:20.017 --> 14:23.751
Music, videos, anything really.

14:23.786 --> 14:25.186
So to be clear,

14:25.222 --> 14:27.455
this is about something that
was said in a private chatroom,

14:27.491 --> 14:29.657
not on the Treasure Hunter game.

14:29.692 --> 14:31.459
This nutter used your game

14:31.495 --> 14:33.995
to lure our kids here, Mr. Nichols.

14:34.549 --> 14:36.964
You don't get off the hook that easy.

14:37.468 --> 14:39.967
Mr. Beaumont,
Boyd had friends of his own,

14:40.003 --> 14:41.769
what does he need this chatroom for?

14:41.804 --> 14:43.538
Well, online friends can say things

14:43.573 --> 14:46.407
that they may not say to people
in person, Ms. Ferguson.

14:46.442 --> 14:47.875
I mean, they can spend countless hours

14:47.911 --> 14:50.044
talking to each other,
become very close,

14:50.079 --> 14:53.547
- even fall in love.
- What's the point?

14:53.582 --> 14:55.982
Well, the point is,
a member of their chatroom,

14:56.018 --> 14:58.785
someone who went by the name
of Phoenix718,

14:58.820 --> 15:01.522
abruptly disappeared six months ago.

15:01.557 --> 15:04.024
- Apparently, he killed himself.
- Oh.

15:04.060 --> 15:07.427
What does that have
to do with our children?

15:07.462 --> 15:09.996
Phoenix718's profile was deleted,

15:10.032 --> 15:12.231
we haven't been able to recover it.

15:12.267 --> 15:15.035
But we did retrieve a number
of anonymous messages,

15:15.070 --> 15:17.737
calling him stupid, worthless,

15:17.773 --> 15:19.806
and a long list of obscenities.

15:20.289 --> 15:21.808
He was bullied?

15:21.843 --> 15:25.711
One of our kids bullied
Phoenix718 to death,

15:25.746 --> 15:28.047
is that what you're saying?

15:28.083 --> 15:30.550
Well, I don't know why
Phoenix killed himself,

15:30.585 --> 15:32.651
but I do know the abductor
thinks the blame lies

15:32.687 --> 15:34.554
with one of your children.

15:34.589 --> 15:36.956
Look, I don't know anything
about these chatrooms,

15:36.991 --> 15:40.258
but I do know that Boyd
would never bully anyone.

15:40.294 --> 15:42.227
Neither would Camille.

15:42.262 --> 15:45.297
Britta would never do such a thing.

15:45.332 --> 15:48.300
Uh, nor Simon, obviously.

15:49.659 --> 15:51.269
Well, thank you for your time.

15:51.305 --> 15:52.871
We're gonna need some help.

15:52.907 --> 15:54.506
I put a social media expert on the case.

15:54.541 --> 15:56.674
We should hear from her shortly.

16:11.958 --> 16:13.101
Camille.

16:14.413 --> 16:16.180
You okay?

16:17.797 --> 16:21.132
I can't believe Phoenix killed himself.

16:24.704 --> 16:27.138
I remember reading the posts.

16:28.141 --> 16:30.441
They were pretty brutal.

16:32.678 --> 16:34.088
They were.

16:36.115 --> 16:39.268
I think it's pretty obvious
who the bully is.

16:39.918 --> 16:42.386
You got something to say, "BigBadBoyd?"

16:42.421 --> 16:45.589
Yes Simon, I do, as a matter of fact.

16:45.933 --> 16:47.590
Why don't you admit you bullied Phoenix,

16:47.626 --> 16:50.493
- so the rest of us can go?
- Because I didn't bully him.

16:50.529 --> 16:52.663
Maybe you want the voice
of Doom to think I did

16:52.698 --> 16:55.365
- to hide your own guilt.
- I didn't do it.

16:55.400 --> 16:59.136
Okay, then, ladies,
any of you two care to confess?

17:01.306 --> 17:04.406
We all shouldn't all die because
of what one of us did.

17:05.810 --> 17:07.810
Maybe it was the guy who escaped.

17:07.845 --> 17:09.502
That's a good point.

17:14.219 --> 17:18.820
Yeah, what if it was him, mate? Huh?

17:30.401 --> 17:32.168
Any luck tracing that feed
from the castle?

17:32.203 --> 17:33.635
I'm still working on it.

17:33.671 --> 17:35.470
Along with our uniformed
friends down the hill.

17:35.506 --> 17:36.871
There's another problem, though.

17:36.907 --> 17:38.440
- What?
- Our chatroom theory.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.609
It seems one of those players
lured to the castle

17:40.644 --> 17:43.044
- wasn't a member.
- The late Logan Smythe.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.280
Whose body we still haven't recovered.

17:45.316 --> 17:47.216
What was he doing there?

17:47.251 --> 17:48.550
An organized personality like this

17:48.586 --> 17:50.242
wouldn't make a mistake like that.

17:52.555 --> 17:56.591
- Eric, it's for you.
- Great. Patch her in.

18:01.031 --> 18:03.131
Thank you so much for calling.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.333
Your expert, huh?

18:05.368 --> 18:06.634
Hello, Mon chÃ©rie.

18:06.669 --> 18:09.503
Mom and Dad working together,
just like old times.

18:09.539 --> 18:11.972
No, we never stopped working together,

18:12.007 --> 18:13.374
Okay, what do you got for us?

18:13.409 --> 18:16.143
All the stuff you sent me
about Phoenix is pretty harsh.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.045
Okay. Anything standout for you?

18:18.080 --> 18:19.913
No pictures of the victim.

18:19.949 --> 18:25.186
But I found a blog post
by a guy named Logan.

18:25.287 --> 18:27.221
Interesting. What's it say?

18:27.256 --> 18:29.322
It's kind of a ranting eulogy,

18:29.358 --> 18:31.892
about how Phoenix was killed
by a cyber-bully.

18:31.927 --> 18:33.861
Hey, Evie, can you send me
a link to the blog?

18:33.896 --> 18:35.262
Yeah, sure thing.

18:35.297 --> 18:38.065
He didn't happen to mention
Phoenix's real name, did he?

18:38.100 --> 18:39.699
No, sorry.

18:39.735 --> 18:41.601
He just kept spewing about how awesome

18:41.637 --> 18:43.570
a Treasure Hunter player he was.

18:43.605 --> 18:45.838
Collected more than just about
anybody in North America.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.307
You couldn't beat him.

18:47.342 --> 18:49.409
Phoenix played Treasure
Hunter in North America.

18:49.444 --> 18:50.977
- Narrows it down.
- Yeah.

18:51.012 --> 18:53.212
Did you find that in 20 minutes?

18:53.650 --> 18:55.982
It's amazing what you can
learn on the Internet.

18:56.017 --> 18:57.917
Except about Dad.

18:57.952 --> 19:00.086
Have you ever done a search of yourself?

19:00.121 --> 19:02.121
There's nothing except your company.

19:02.157 --> 19:03.722
It's like you don't exist.

19:03.758 --> 19:05.624
No, it's liberating, you should try it.

19:05.660 --> 19:07.493
This is great, Honey. Thank you.

19:07.528 --> 19:09.028
Have fun with your grandmother.

19:09.063 --> 19:10.863
I'll come up when I'm done.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.731
And bring Dad, too?

19:12.767 --> 19:14.366
Goodbye, Evie.

19:14.402 --> 19:16.274
You heard what the girl said.

19:17.371 --> 19:20.105
Don't start with me, Mr. Beaumont.

19:25.545 --> 19:27.679
Ah. Ms. Ferguson wants to talk to you.

19:33.987 --> 19:35.853
Um,

19:35.888 --> 19:37.822
I didn't want to say anything
in front of the others...

19:37.857 --> 19:40.425
That's all right.
Whatever you say is between us.

19:40.460 --> 19:43.594
Boyd was diagnosed
with brain cancer last spring.

19:43.630 --> 19:46.864
That's why I agreed to take him
to this game convention.

19:47.393 --> 19:50.267
The doctors think he may
only have six months left.

19:50.549 --> 19:52.937
I'm so sorry, Ms. Ferguson.

19:52.972 --> 19:54.905
I'm pretty sure he has
his medication with him,

19:54.941 --> 19:58.909
but the amount of stress
he must be under, I...

20:00.512 --> 20:03.981
Oh, please, you have got
to get him out of there.

20:04.016 --> 20:06.150
We'll do everything we can.

20:06.185 --> 20:07.684
Thank you for sharing this with us.

20:17.929 --> 20:19.756
You think that's significant?

20:22.434 --> 20:24.167
You can stop staring at the thing.

20:24.202 --> 20:26.002
Maybe there's a way to disable it.

20:26.037 --> 20:27.737
This isn't a movie.

20:27.772 --> 20:29.705
But I wanna get out of here, okay?

20:29.741 --> 20:31.341
Sorry, Boyd,

20:31.376 --> 20:33.243
I don't remember you from the chatroom.

20:33.278 --> 20:34.810
With all the thousands of people

20:34.846 --> 20:36.112
who are in the Treasure Hunter chatroom,

20:36.147 --> 20:37.981
- you don't remember me?
- Hmh.

20:38.016 --> 20:41.984
I'm mortally offended. I remember you.

20:42.019 --> 20:43.486
I do, too.

20:43.966 --> 20:47.205
You're very funny. In a good way.

20:47.458 --> 20:49.157
I do my best.

20:49.193 --> 20:51.727
You gave me good advice
about a boy once.

20:51.763 --> 20:53.863
Oh yeah. Did you listen?

20:53.898 --> 20:57.832
Of course not. That would be sensible.

20:58.228 --> 21:00.802
We're losing our minds in here.

21:00.837 --> 21:03.723
Can you let us out. Please!

21:04.074 --> 21:06.875
He's not letting anybody go
until he gets his confession.

21:10.281 --> 21:12.381
If one of us admitted
to bullying Phoenix,

21:12.416 --> 21:14.416
will you show mercy?

21:14.451 --> 21:16.951
I'm sure whoever did it is really sorry

21:16.986 --> 21:19.421
and wants to come forward,

21:20.457 --> 21:22.485
but they're scared!

21:23.663 --> 21:24.916
Are you okay, Boyd?

21:26.252 --> 21:27.791
Top of the world.

21:32.558 --> 21:34.291
I got it.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.427
- You got where that feed goes.
- Not exactly.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.329
But there's a burner piggy
backing the signal.

21:38.364 --> 21:41.231
I can't trace the location,
but I can try calling it.

21:50.308 --> 21:52.375
Contact.

21:54.412 --> 21:56.780
My name's Eric Beaumont,
I'm a private negotiator.

21:58.005 --> 21:59.716
How did you get this number?

21:59.751 --> 22:01.084
That doesn't really matter, does it?

22:01.119 --> 22:02.619
One life has already been lost.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.620
Now I wanna make sure
that no one else gets hurt.

22:04.655 --> 22:08.024
The guilty party confesses
or they all die.

22:09.660 --> 22:11.560
No latency suggests conviction.

22:11.596 --> 22:13.229
There's no point in trying
to talk him out of this.

22:13.264 --> 22:15.731
The rise in volume
suggests inflexibility.

22:15.766 --> 22:17.200
He's not gonna change his mind.

22:17.235 --> 22:19.845
We need to get on his side
and work with him.

22:20.605 --> 22:22.805
Listen, I'm a professional negotiator.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.874
Let me talk to your captives.

22:24.909 --> 22:27.510
I'll persuade the guilty party
to confess.

22:28.793 --> 22:31.693
Eric, you know
he intends to kill that person?

22:31.816 --> 22:33.582
Yeah.

22:36.020 --> 22:38.353
What do you say? I mean,
the sooner they confess,

22:38.389 --> 22:40.588
the sooner we all go home.

22:46.630 --> 22:48.329
Deal.

23:06.617 --> 23:08.582
Can I talk to you for a minute?

23:10.093 --> 23:11.559
Alone.

23:35.615 --> 23:38.115
Wait. Where are we going?

23:38.151 --> 23:39.884
Just follow me.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
What are we doing in here?

23:56.035 --> 23:59.436
That psycho could have
microphones anywhere.

23:59.471 --> 24:01.972
I wanna make sure he's not listening.

24:02.008 --> 24:04.075
We have nothing to talk about.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.177
I'd say we do.

24:08.547 --> 24:10.046
I'm listening.

24:12.618 --> 24:15.552
You're not gonna do anything
stupid, are you?

24:15.588 --> 24:17.288
Like what?

24:19.458 --> 24:22.359
- I feel bad about what happened.
- Oh, boo-hoo.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.560
You're a bastard, you know that?

24:25.797 --> 24:28.331
And you're cuter
than I thought you'd be.

24:28.366 --> 24:29.933
Play your cards right,

24:29.968 --> 24:31.601
and we could have some fun together.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.937
Britta was right about you.

24:33.972 --> 24:35.638
What'd she say?

24:35.673 --> 24:37.206
That you were a jerk.

24:38.176 --> 24:40.509
I'm not so bad.

24:41.040 --> 24:43.279
Give me a chance.

24:43.314 --> 24:45.151
Not going to happen.

24:46.851 --> 24:49.206
But don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.

24:49.871 --> 24:52.555
Our secret, you mean.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.225
Don't go saying something stupid.

24:56.260 --> 24:58.293
Camille! Simon!

24:58.328 --> 24:59.628
What?!

24:59.663 --> 25:01.529
Come back here now.

25:06.669 --> 25:08.335
We're all here now.

25:08.371 --> 25:10.738
I'm Eric Beaumont, a negotiator.

25:11.941 --> 25:13.875
Well, there's a bomb in here,
Mr. Negotiator!

25:13.910 --> 25:15.509
The whole place is wired to blow.

25:15.544 --> 25:17.444
We're gonna get you out
of there safe and sound.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.446
I know that your parents
will be relieved to hear

25:19.482 --> 25:20.968
you're all okay.

25:21.917 --> 25:23.303
We're fine.

25:23.819 --> 25:26.720
- Is my father there, too?
- He is.

25:26.756 --> 25:29.657
Could you tell my mother
I love her, please.

25:29.692 --> 25:31.725
- Mine, too.
- And mine.

25:31.761 --> 25:33.445
And tell her I'm really
sorry about this.

25:33.896 --> 25:35.328
Of course I will.

25:35.363 --> 25:37.530
I'm gonna get you outta there,
but I'm gonna need your help.

25:37.565 --> 25:39.166
What kind of help?

25:39.201 --> 25:41.601
You all knew Phoenix718.

25:41.636 --> 25:45.077
Can anyone explain why he was bullied?

25:46.164 --> 25:47.841
Okay, I didn't do anything,

25:47.876 --> 25:49.910
but he was kind of annoying.

25:50.365 --> 25:51.644
In what way?

25:51.680 --> 25:53.579
He was just very full of himself, and...

25:54.040 --> 25:55.915
thought he knew everything
about anything.

25:55.950 --> 25:58.083
Look, he killed himself.

25:58.119 --> 26:00.386
I'm sorry about that,
but we didn't touch him.

26:00.422 --> 26:02.221
Someone thought enough of Phoenix718

26:02.256 --> 26:04.324
to seek revenge on his behalf.

26:04.359 --> 26:06.192
It's terrible, what happened to him.

26:06.227 --> 26:07.960
But if one of us did,

26:07.995 --> 26:10.662
and I'm not saying we did,
drive him to it,

26:10.698 --> 26:12.798
and we admitted that? We'd be killed.

26:12.834 --> 26:14.466
Enough.

26:15.085 --> 26:17.036
Well, that wasn't very helpful, was it?

26:17.071 --> 26:19.238
Oh, to the contrary.

26:19.273 --> 26:20.639
Can you get the abductor
back on the line?

26:20.674 --> 26:22.842
- Right away.
- Eric...

26:25.813 --> 26:26.945
Well?

26:26.980 --> 26:29.279
I think I know who bullied Phoenix.

26:29.950 --> 26:32.217
You think? But no...

26:33.387 --> 26:35.320
You'll have to repeat that,
we didn't get it.

26:35.356 --> 26:39.190
I said, you think, but no one confessed.

26:39.226 --> 26:41.592
Well, talking to them over
a speaker doesn't work.

26:42.242 --> 26:44.395
I need to see them face to face.

26:44.430 --> 26:47.298
Eric, the castle is
surrounded by explosives.

26:47.334 --> 26:50.701
Five players followed a path
inside without incident.

26:51.378 --> 26:53.571
Send me the same instructions
that you sent them.

26:54.178 --> 26:56.007
If you don't find the guilty party,

26:56.042 --> 26:58.442
you die with them.

27:00.012 --> 27:02.312
Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?

27:02.348 --> 27:04.415
Well, we've only got an hour
before the sun sets

27:04.450 --> 27:05.750
and the police come charging in.

27:05.785 --> 27:07.585
He may not see you
as an asset. In which case,

27:07.620 --> 27:09.653
he can direct you to walk
right into an explosive.

27:09.689 --> 27:11.756
- That's not how he plays.
- But you can't be certain.

27:11.791 --> 27:14.124
No I can't, but it's the only
move I've got right now.

27:14.159 --> 27:15.893
The instructions are in.

27:15.928 --> 27:17.730
All right, send them to my phone.

27:17.765 --> 27:21.164
Eric, you told him you
know who bullied Phoenix.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.300
What happens when he finds out
you're bluffing?

27:23.791 --> 27:25.202
Who's bluffing?

27:25.237 --> 27:26.904
You know who bullied him?

27:26.939 --> 27:28.538
I have an idea.

27:28.573 --> 27:30.540
It's a game, Maxine.

27:30.575 --> 27:32.475
Don't worry, I won't lose.

27:43.614 --> 27:45.013
Where's Eric?

27:48.085 --> 27:49.788
Please tell me he's not going inside.

27:49.823 --> 27:52.387
I would if that wasn't
exactly what he's doing.

27:52.423 --> 27:55.123
Eric, turn around now.

27:55.159 --> 27:56.591
Nathalie, it's fine.

27:56.626 --> 27:58.693
You're gonna blow yourself up!

27:58.728 --> 28:00.643
I've got a map for this.

28:00.678 --> 28:02.031
Trust me.

28:02.366 --> 28:05.533
He's far more likely to kill me
when I get inside.

28:06.281 --> 28:08.381
Is that supposed to be reassuring?

28:08.417 --> 28:11.017
It's gonna be dark in 30 minutes.

28:11.052 --> 28:12.452
I'll go speak to the police.

28:12.488 --> 28:14.087
I'll stall them as long as I can.

28:14.123 --> 28:15.631
Thank you.

28:31.820 --> 28:33.820
_

28:34.342 --> 28:36.509
You know that part where
his voice was garbled before?

28:36.544 --> 28:38.910
- Yeah, I remember.
- Can you play that again?

28:40.381 --> 28:42.248
I traced a call through a PDX system.

28:42.283 --> 28:44.316
- Probably an office or a hotel.
- Okay.

28:44.352 --> 28:47.419
You think? But no...

28:47.455 --> 28:49.355
It's distorted by the audio filter,

28:49.390 --> 28:51.723
but I know I've heard that sound before.

28:51.759 --> 28:52.991
So have I.

28:53.027 --> 28:54.853
I think I know where it's coming from.

29:03.137 --> 29:05.037
Okay, I'm in the courtyard.

29:05.072 --> 29:07.673
Okay, the entry codes
are coming through.

29:11.678 --> 29:14.279
38, 71, 19.

29:14.314 --> 29:16.648
Once you step inside,
the door will lock behind you

29:16.683 --> 29:18.616
and the code will be invalid.

29:30.797 --> 29:32.863
Hold the door. Hold the door!

29:32.899 --> 29:35.199
Don't let anyone leave.

29:35.234 --> 29:36.967
Give me your phone.

29:39.572 --> 29:41.732
No service, huh?

29:42.842 --> 29:45.309
Games room, though here?

30:02.194 --> 30:03.754
Church bells.

30:04.930 --> 30:07.864
That's the sound we heard on the call.

30:07.899 --> 30:10.362
The voice must be close.

30:13.105 --> 30:15.438
The hotel. Zara, look.

30:15.473 --> 30:17.240
- Let's hope Oliver was right.
- Okay.

30:29.519 --> 30:31.886
Our host is listening so...

30:31.921 --> 30:36.056
let's talk about who bullied Phoenix718.

30:36.226 --> 30:37.925
It wasn't me.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.293
I already said, I didn't do it.

30:39.328 --> 30:41.229
Right. But you all know
what was happening to Phoenix

30:41.264 --> 30:44.265
and did nothing to stop it.
Isn't that true?

30:44.300 --> 30:46.200
Service De chambre.

30:47.470 --> 30:50.004
Service De chambre.

30:51.338 --> 30:52.907
That was the last one.

30:54.010 --> 30:55.784
Zara, look.

30:56.879 --> 30:59.480
It had to be that guy he
killed when we first got here.

30:59.515 --> 31:02.082
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

31:02.117 --> 31:03.984
Either someone left the light on...

31:04.019 --> 31:05.452
Or...

31:06.455 --> 31:10.223
Well, because Logan's not dead.

31:12.494 --> 31:13.960
How's that possible?

31:13.996 --> 31:15.996
Logan Smythe worked
at a software company

31:16.031 --> 31:18.298
specializing in firewalls.

31:21.970 --> 31:23.970
Eric was right, this is a game.

31:24.006 --> 31:26.773
Only he had the know how
to pull off something like this

31:26.809 --> 31:28.474
and he was the only here

31:28.510 --> 31:30.543
who wasn't a member of your chatroom.

31:30.578 --> 31:32.344
Logan Smythe.

31:33.147 --> 31:35.648
Nice to see you're not blown to pieces.

31:39.454 --> 31:41.754
It's all choreographed perfectly.

31:41.790 --> 31:44.424
Logan finding the only window
in the entire castle

31:44.459 --> 31:46.558
that wasn't locked shut.

31:46.593 --> 31:49.795
Triggers an explosive just
as he runs into the tree line.

31:49.831 --> 31:53.065
- But I saw him die.
- We all saw him die.

31:53.100 --> 31:55.968
Well, you saw what he wanted you to see.

31:58.172 --> 32:01.263
Then he convinced everybody
there were more explosives,

32:01.299 --> 32:03.408
so they couldn't check for a body.

32:04.070 --> 32:06.110
Logan digitally disguised his voice.

32:06.146 --> 32:09.013
He's who you've been
talking to this whole time.

32:09.049 --> 32:11.416
So his death wasn't real.

32:11.452 --> 32:14.853
No more real than those
explosives outside the castle.

32:14.888 --> 32:16.421
There's another one in this cupboard.

32:18.325 --> 32:19.891
It's a fake.

32:19.926 --> 32:21.829
You're kidding me.

32:23.763 --> 32:25.096
The bomb squad's on the way.

32:25.131 --> 32:28.589
Call them off. No bombs.

32:29.402 --> 32:32.670
But the voice was talking
to us with Logan in the room.

32:32.705 --> 32:35.105
Oh no, he pre-recorded his voice.

32:35.517 --> 32:37.708
Someone here triggered it with a remote.

32:37.744 --> 32:39.343
Who?

32:42.415 --> 32:44.634
Phoenix718.

32:45.443 --> 32:46.884
I take it that's real.

32:46.919 --> 32:48.386
One way to find out.

32:48.421 --> 32:50.388
Oliver, could you call
the parents over please?

32:50.423 --> 32:51.736
Right away.

32:51.771 --> 32:54.624
You're BigBadBoyd36.

32:54.659 --> 32:56.927
That was someone else's
handle in the chatroom.

32:56.962 --> 32:59.528
Boyd was Phoenix718.

33:00.368 --> 33:02.399
No, Phoenix killed himself.

33:02.434 --> 33:05.135
He attempted suicide.

33:05.732 --> 33:08.210
That's why you closed
your account, isn't it?

33:09.305 --> 33:11.674
I promised Boyd I'd be there for him.

33:11.710 --> 33:13.342
Right 'til the very end.

33:13.378 --> 33:15.144
This is the end.

33:15.179 --> 33:17.447
He thought he'd found real friends.

33:17.482 --> 33:19.081
And what did they do to him?

33:19.117 --> 33:21.017
The police are gonna move
on the castle, Logan,

33:21.052 --> 33:24.120
- they'll kill him.
- He's dying anyway.

33:24.440 --> 33:27.023
You are loyal to your friend,
we get that.

33:27.058 --> 33:29.458
But there are other kids in
there that could get hurt, too.

33:29.493 --> 33:32.639
The only way anyone is
walking out of there

33:33.131 --> 33:36.365
is if the bully confesses.

33:40.504 --> 33:42.222
Whoever did it, confess.

33:43.073 --> 33:45.374
Confess now, or you all die!

33:46.043 --> 33:47.631
It's your kid.

33:49.112 --> 33:51.780
- Boyd?
- They're all here, Eric.

33:51.816 --> 33:53.214
Okay, you might wanna tone it down,

33:53.250 --> 33:54.516
your mother is listening now.

33:54.552 --> 33:56.096
No, she never understood.

33:56.554 --> 33:58.453
Life was hell at school.

33:58.488 --> 34:00.855
The only place I had a life was online.

34:00.890 --> 34:02.523
I understand.

34:02.559 --> 34:05.560
These online contacts
became your real friends.

34:06.143 --> 34:07.886
More than friends.

34:08.847 --> 34:10.531
They were my family.

34:12.635 --> 34:15.034
I liked you, Phoenix. I really did.

34:15.071 --> 34:16.771
You didn't.

34:16.806 --> 34:18.371
You were always a little odd,

34:18.407 --> 34:20.908
but you were kind
and you never hurt anybody.

34:20.944 --> 34:22.539
Please.

34:23.212 --> 34:26.714
You're obnoxious. Self-centered.

34:26.748 --> 34:30.184
Even before I saw you,
I could tell you were a nerd.

34:30.219 --> 34:32.167
And a loser.

34:34.590 --> 34:36.190
No wonder you couldn't get it up.

34:36.225 --> 34:37.880
You wanna die?!

34:38.360 --> 34:40.494
I said that to you
in a private chatroom.

34:40.529 --> 34:43.130
And then one of you decided
to violate my trust.

34:43.165 --> 34:44.797
Mock me.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.367
Humiliate me.

34:46.402 --> 34:48.101
I told you, I didn't do it.

34:48.136 --> 34:49.569
You can put the gun down, Boyd.

34:49.605 --> 34:51.391
I can tell you who it was.

34:52.674 --> 34:54.273
Who?

35:04.019 --> 35:05.951
Who was it?

35:08.256 --> 35:10.589
- Me.
- Camille?

35:11.926 --> 35:14.027
Boyd, no.

35:16.697 --> 35:18.405
You?

35:19.367 --> 35:22.501
- But he...
- He thought it was funny.

35:22.537 --> 35:24.910
But I'm the one who started all.

35:27.740 --> 35:28.806
Why?

35:29.410 --> 35:31.251
Isn't it obvious, mate?

35:31.846 --> 35:33.478
Look at me, look at you.

35:33.514 --> 35:36.348
She couldn't even see me or you?

35:36.383 --> 35:38.450
Shogun flirted with me.

35:40.154 --> 35:43.187
My real-life boyfriend
just broke up with me.

35:43.723 --> 35:46.533
I guess the attention made me feel good.

35:47.394 --> 35:49.727
I wanted to impress him.

35:51.598 --> 35:53.698
I didn't make her do it.

35:53.733 --> 35:56.740
- Don't try and pin this on me.
- I'm not saying that.

35:58.438 --> 36:00.195
It was all me.

36:01.808 --> 36:05.877
The crueler I was,
the more attention he gave me.

36:07.708 --> 36:09.080
I'm sorry.

36:12.218 --> 36:13.717
I liked you.

36:14.954 --> 36:16.507
I really did.

36:19.525 --> 36:22.193
But you have to pay for what you did.

36:22.228 --> 36:24.161
I get it. You had one thing
on you bucket list,

36:24.197 --> 36:27.497
to find out who betrayed you,
but now that you know...

36:27.532 --> 36:30.801
what you want is revenge,
what you need...

36:32.471 --> 36:34.504
is to forgive.

36:35.674 --> 36:37.709
You really want to hurt her?

36:38.310 --> 36:40.075
I'm sorry.

37:09.540 --> 37:11.607
You're kidding me.

37:12.777 --> 37:15.111
The Stockholm syndrome, right?

37:15.146 --> 37:16.745
It's remorse, you idiot.

37:28.425 --> 37:30.359
Pretty slick operation,
you got here, Ace.

37:30.394 --> 37:32.493
Obviously not slick enough.

37:32.529 --> 37:35.296
Yeah, well, #realworldproblems, huh?

37:35.331 --> 37:37.331
Just one question.

37:37.367 --> 37:39.868
Boyd lives in Idaho, you live in London,

37:39.903 --> 37:41.502
How'd you guys even meet?

37:41.538 --> 37:43.371
We still haven't, actually.

37:44.041 --> 37:46.407
All this for someone
you've never even met?

37:46.442 --> 37:48.742
I know what it's like
to be bullied like that.

37:48.778 --> 37:50.511
When I heard about the brain tumor,

37:51.260 --> 37:54.215
I just wanted to give him
something before he died.

37:54.250 --> 37:56.750
Yeah, well...
there's some police officers

37:56.786 --> 37:59.253
who'd like to ask you
some question about that.

37:59.791 --> 38:01.622
I don't speak French.

38:02.541 --> 38:04.625
Good thing I'm here to translate.

38:08.831 --> 38:10.086
Maman.

38:14.366 --> 38:15.830
Mr. Holman.

38:16.438 --> 38:18.138
On behalf of Zama Corporation,

38:18.174 --> 38:20.007
I'd like to express our relief
that Simon has been returned...

38:20.042 --> 38:23.443
Save it for court.
I'm going to sue you so hard

38:23.478 --> 38:26.045
your great grandchildren will owe me.

38:26.081 --> 38:28.215
Car. Now.

38:28.250 --> 38:29.916
Lieutenant.

38:36.458 --> 38:38.290
Hey.

38:38.326 --> 38:40.693
You scared me so much.

38:47.535 --> 38:50.036
Jane, we might wanna give them a moment.

38:50.071 --> 38:54.140
Thank you so much.

38:54.175 --> 38:57.476
I wanted to tell you that
if we met in person,

38:58.471 --> 39:01.146
I never would have done any of it.

39:01.181 --> 39:05.569
But if it's not too late,
maybe we can be friends.

39:07.722 --> 39:08.954
I'd like that.

39:15.595 --> 39:18.341
Probably. Yeah.

39:33.964 --> 39:35.946
Good job keeping the cops at bay.

39:35.982 --> 39:38.616
When did you know Phoenix was Boyd?

39:39.327 --> 39:40.951
I'm in trouble, aren't I?

39:42.021 --> 39:45.589
When Ms. Ferguson said this
was her first trip to Europe.

39:45.624 --> 39:47.291
That early?

39:47.326 --> 39:49.260
Well, you know how I feel
about coincidences.

39:49.295 --> 39:50.861
And the explosives?

39:50.897 --> 39:52.797
You knew also that they weren't real?

39:52.832 --> 39:55.032
You're right. I should've told you,

39:55.067 --> 39:57.935
- so you didn't worry.
- Why would I worry

39:57.970 --> 40:00.870
if the father of my child
gets blown sky high?

40:00.906 --> 40:02.872
I don't even get called
"husband" any more?

40:05.511 --> 40:09.245
All right, the truth is, I had a hunch.

40:09.281 --> 40:11.024
I was not certain.

40:11.517 --> 40:13.317
And yet you walked through them

40:13.352 --> 40:15.920
to save the lives of those kids?

40:16.555 --> 40:19.322
Evie could have been one of those kids.

40:47.040 --> 40:50.006
