** [Rock]

00:37.871 --> 00:39.207
* "Mama Claus," said Santa *

00:39.273 --> 00:41.275
* "Why you look so down? *

00:43.511 --> 00:44.845
* Christmas is a-comin' *

00:44.912 --> 00:49.083
* And the kids
have been poutin' around *

00:49.150 --> 00:50.351
* Get your gear to the sleigh *

00:50.418 --> 00:51.919
* Get on your way *

00:51.985 --> 00:54.522
* The boys and girls are
waitin' on Christmas Day *

00:54.588 --> 00:56.857
* What's the matter with you? *

00:56.924 --> 01:01.262
* Turn that frown around" *

01:01.329 --> 01:04.232
- [Tires Screech]
- Thank you.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.866
* Go, Santa
Ho, ho, ho *

01:05.933 --> 01:07.601
[Santa]
Ho, ho, ho.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.670
I don't think
you can park there, friend.

01:09.737 --> 01:13.374
- It's marked "handicapped."
- Thanks for pointing that out.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.509
* So go, Santa
Go, go *

01:15.576 --> 01:18.146
Not exactly bucking for
the "nice list," are you?
[Car Alarm Chirps]

01:18.212 --> 01:20.848
Nope. Focusing on
the "rich list."

01:22.950 --> 01:24.418
[Chuckles]

01:24.485 --> 01:26.754
* Go, Santa
Go, go **

01:30.224 --> 01:32.160
Mr. Ardwick?

01:32.226 --> 01:34.862
I told you on the phone
we need more time.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.398
Our center's director ran off
with all of our money.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.901
I'm aware of your situation,
but I thought it might be better
if we talked face-to-face.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.536
So you'll grant us
an extension?

01:42.603 --> 01:43.871
Of course not.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.374
What is your problem, dude?
You seem happy about this.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.409
And who are you?
The muscle?

01:48.476 --> 01:53.647
[Clears Throat]
We are scrambling to find some
way to cover the lease payment.

01:53.714 --> 01:56.184
I-If only you'd let the kids
put on their Christmas play.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.419
They have been selling
tickets all over town.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.053
Unless you're charging
Broadway prices,

02:00.120 --> 02:01.489
It's not even
going to make a dent.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.591
There must be
something we can do.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.093
Oh, there is.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.095
Vacate the premises
by the 15th,

02:08.162 --> 02:10.163
Because that's when
the bulldozer's coming.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.800
Don't hesitate
to call our office...

02:12.866 --> 02:14.435
With any questions.

02:14.502 --> 02:17.638
- But it's almost Christmas.
- I know.

02:17.705 --> 02:20.574
You might want to take down
these decorations.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.711
Sort of gets everyone's
hopes up, doesn't it?

02:26.447 --> 02:30.618
I can't believe
you're doing this.
You suck!

02:30.684 --> 02:32.886
Life's full
of disappointments, kid.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.855
Get used to it.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.601
Merry Christmas.
It will be for me.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.773
[Tires Screeching]

03:02.049 --> 03:03.917
[Car Alarm Chirps]

03:08.656 --> 03:10.558
Yo, Donald!

03:10.624 --> 03:12.560
You might want
to dye the hair.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.696
It's a young man's business.
Will do, Ax Man.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.798
[Sighs]
Jerk.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.469
Hey, bro.
Dig the hair.
Come in and see...

03:21.535 --> 03:24.204
You're obviously new here,
so let me explain
how things work.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.739
It's not a big deal.
First lesson...

03:25.806 --> 03:27.975
On the way up, treat everyone
like your best friend,

03:28.041 --> 03:30.878
Or on the way down,
they could become
your worst nightmare.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.179
Mister...
Second lesson...

03:32.246 --> 03:33.681
Don't interrupt.
But, sir...

03:33.747 --> 03:36.216
What? What is it
you're trying to say, bro?

03:36.284 --> 03:39.019
Mr. Ardwick,
I've worked here
for 16 years.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.422
And Lane wants
to see you... bro.

03:41.489 --> 03:44.558
Well, why didn't
you say that?

03:49.897 --> 03:50.964
Jerk.

03:53.301 --> 03:56.937
How'd it go, Dax?
Tell Epic Mart the property's
theirs after the 15th.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.707
That's my man!
Dax the Ax!

03:59.773 --> 04:02.276
Great job today.
I've learned
from the best, Lane.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.645
Nobody can teach a shark
how to be a shark.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.079
A shark just is.

04:06.146 --> 04:08.516
And a shark knows
when there's blood
in the water.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.217
Word is Peterman's out.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.085
It's no secret
I want his position.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.154
Yeah, about that...
What's this?

04:14.221 --> 04:15.856
Two weeks severance.
You're fired.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.526
[Laughs]
What?

04:18.591 --> 04:20.761
Yeah, it turns out
Henderson's an even
bigger shark than you.

04:20.827 --> 04:23.831
He's convinced us
he can do his job
and yours with no problem.

04:23.897 --> 04:27.435
And you know what?
Just between you and me,
people don't like you very much.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.936
People don't like me
very much?

04:29.002 --> 04:32.005
Did I say "very much"?
People don't like you at all.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.274
Let me get this straight.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.877
You're giving Dax the Ax...

04:36.944 --> 04:38.145
The ax?

04:38.211 --> 04:40.448
[Chuckling]
That's a real clever way
of putting it.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.249
Oh, I am going to miss
your sense of humor.

04:42.316 --> 04:43.717
But it's almost Christmas.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.286
Come on.
Like that's ever worked.
Have some dignity.

04:46.354 --> 04:49.289
You can't do this.
I bought a house.
A house I can't afford.

04:49.357 --> 04:52.726
Well, that was dumb.
Now please leave my office.
This is getting sad.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.762
After years of doing
your dirty work...

04:54.828 --> 04:57.365
And covering up
your creative accounting,

04:57.431 --> 04:58.899
You're just gonna
throw me out?

04:58.966 --> 05:01.902
No. I'm not
gonna throw you out.
You're a big guy.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.505
Security!
I need you to throw
somebody out!

05:04.572 --> 05:06.574
How about I throw you out?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.241
Out the window.
How about that?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.478
Take it easy, Dax.
Don't do anything
you're gonna regret.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.913
Regret?
Oh, I'm downright giddy
about this!

05:15.916 --> 05:18.686
No! That's it.
Oh, not only are you never
ever working here again,

05:18.752 --> 05:20.754
But I'll see to it that
you never work anywhere again.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.757
Don't you dare touch my signed
Super Bowl football!

05:26.894 --> 05:29.797
I'll give you
a head start, Lane.
I suggest you use it.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.938
[Employees Gasping]

05:39.172 --> 05:41.409
Uh-oh.

05:41.475 --> 05:44.578
Come on, bro.
I thought we were friends.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.380
I gave you that
great career advice.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.015
Yes, you did.
[Grunts]

05:48.081 --> 05:50.451
[Employees Gasping]

05:50.518 --> 05:53.454
Enjoy the ride down...
bro.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.235
[Dial Tone]
[Beeps]

06:08.301 --> 06:11.839
I've called six other firms.
They won't even speak to me.
That's terrible, honey.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.708
Plus, that spineless jerk Lane
is threatening to press
assault charges.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.209
I can't believe
this is happening.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.846
I thought I had
that promotion in the bag.
Mm-hmm.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.114
This was my shot
at the big time.

06:22.450 --> 06:25.185
Don't worry, babe.
I'm gonna bounce back.

06:25.252 --> 06:26.854
I mean,
I have to, right?

06:26.920 --> 06:28.689
What are you doing?
Leaving you.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.824
- What?
- Face it, we had fun.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.793
But a smart girl knows
when to leave a sinking ship.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.327
Who ever accused you
of being smart?

06:34.394 --> 06:36.697
[Scoffs]

06:41.401 --> 06:42.970
[Door Opens]

06:43.036 --> 06:44.638
Tanya.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.442
If you leave,
you're not coming back.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.243
Good luck, Dax.
You're gonna need it.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.946
You have no friends,
you're incredibly self-centered,

06:53.013 --> 06:55.516
And you're not
a very likable person.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.217
Yeah, well,
you dated me.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.586
Huh.

06:58.652 --> 07:01.154
I guess
I'm not that smart.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.492
Women, huh?
[Scoffs]

07:04.558 --> 07:07.394
She's confusing
"having no friends"
with being a "lone wolf."

07:07.461 --> 07:11.064
Those are two very
different things.
Oh, I hear ya, pal.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.900
Sign here.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.437
[Sighs]

07:19.406 --> 07:21.208
Hey!
What are you doing?

07:21.274 --> 07:23.777
The company wants
their car back.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.713
Hope the lone wolf's
got a bicycle.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.549
No, no, no, no, no!
I can live without
the girlfriend,

07:28.616 --> 07:30.484
But the car?

07:31.785 --> 07:34.855
The car and I are in love!
[Car Horn Honks]

07:47.067 --> 07:50.137
[Wind Whistling]

07:50.203 --> 07:52.873
[Barking]

07:57.811 --> 08:02.282
[Man's Voice]
T-minus 10, nine,
eight, seven...

08:02.349 --> 08:04.818
What are you looking at?

08:04.885 --> 08:09.422
And you... You beat me once,
but I'm taking you down!

08:09.489 --> 08:11.291
You hear me?

08:11.358 --> 08:13.861
I'm taking you down!

08:16.029 --> 08:17.931
Can I help you?

08:19.199 --> 08:21.134
Uh... Hey, uh...

08:21.201 --> 08:23.403
Nice night, huh?

08:23.470 --> 08:25.405
Well, for some of us.

08:25.472 --> 08:28.576
- But you...
You don't look so good.
- It's been a rough week.

08:28.642 --> 08:32.345
Is that why you're out here
in the middle of the night
yelling at a building?

08:32.412 --> 08:34.014
Nah, this place is...

08:34.081 --> 08:38.018
Why are you here?
Maybe I was
looking for you.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.220
I appreciate the compliment,
but I play for the other...

08:40.287 --> 08:41.722
No, Dax.

08:41.789 --> 08:44.191
I thought you might need
someone to talk to.

08:44.256 --> 08:46.660
How would you know that?
How did you know my name?

08:46.727 --> 08:49.062
I'm Santa.
[Scoffs]

08:49.129 --> 08:51.398
Now just humor me, son.

08:51.464 --> 08:55.135
Tell me what you want
for Christmas.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.070
Let's see. Hmm?

08:57.137 --> 08:58.672
I have no car,

08:58.739 --> 09:01.441
No money, no job,
no friends.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.644
How about a pony, Santa?

09:03.711 --> 09:05.679
No, I'm serious, Dax.

09:05.746 --> 09:08.749
What would it take to turn this
whole thing around for you?
Doesn't matter.

09:08.816 --> 09:11.585
My life is screwed.
Why would you say that?

09:11.652 --> 09:14.988
I repeat...
I have no money,
no friends, no jobs.

09:15.055 --> 09:18.391
Nothing! Nothing is
going to fix this!
You never know.

09:18.458 --> 09:22.295
It's never too late
to be the person you should be.

09:22.362 --> 09:25.165
[Chuckles]
Yeah.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.368
You should put that
in one of those
self-help books.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.337
"Fake Santa's False Hopes."

09:35.876 --> 09:37.878
Never heard that one before.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.256
[Man]
Merry Christmas!

09:52.592 --> 09:55.162
[Excited Chatter]

10:01.401 --> 10:03.236
[Woman]
I need more tape.

10:07.775 --> 10:10.110
Who's hungry?
[Workers]
I am!

10:14.381 --> 10:15.883
One more.
[Beeps]

10:15.949 --> 10:17.550
Come on, Santa.
Your form is sloppy.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.954
Back straight,
chin up, knees high.
Let's go. Let's go.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.356
You certainly know
how to keep me in line,
don't you, Billie?

10:23.423 --> 10:25.759
Well, it's my job to make sure
you can do your job properly.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.560
Let's go.
One more.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.597
Aye-aye,
my round-eared friend.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.432
Oh, by the way,

10:32.499 --> 10:35.568
I received some
very disappointing news
yesterday.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.537
Did your cholesterol tests
come back?

10:37.604 --> 10:39.940
Ho-ho. No.

10:40.007 --> 10:44.644
I got a letter of resignation
from the Head Office Herald
of Holiday Operations.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.246
Twixel's resigning?

10:46.313 --> 10:49.582
What? He's been the HOHOHO
for almost 200 years.
I know.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.585
Apparently, he doesn't
believe he can do his job
effectively anymore.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.488
His mind's getting
a little... mmm.

10:55.555 --> 10:59.359
[Chuckles]
Last night, he accidently
turned my sleigh...

10:59.426 --> 11:01.829
Into a breakfast burrito.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.565
No, I did not eat it.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.735
Uh-huh.
Could have fooled me.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.536
[Both Chuckling]

11:09.602 --> 11:11.038
So what are we
gonna do now?

11:11.104 --> 11:13.741
Well, I need to select
a new HOHOHO, and soon.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.442
It's awfully close
to crunch time,

11:15.508 --> 11:16.877
And without
my little helper...

11:16.944 --> 11:18.912
I bet I know who's dying
to be appointed.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.114
[Together]
Eleanor.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.150
As Twixel's daughter,
she seems to believe...

11:23.216 --> 11:25.585
That the position
is hers for the taking.

11:25.652 --> 11:28.789
But ultimately,
the decision is mine.

11:28.856 --> 11:33.060
I'm looking for someone
who not only has the
distribution genius of Amazon,

11:33.126 --> 11:37.564
But also truly embodies
the five sugarplum virtues.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.267
Hmm?
A cool head.
Humility.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.770
Cooperative nature.
Inspirational spirit.

11:42.836 --> 11:45.238
And, of course,
the fifth
and most important...

11:45.305 --> 11:48.475
A kind soul.
Exactly.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.911
Now I do have
someone in mind.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.445
Who?

11:53.947 --> 11:57.851
I've been looking into this
particular fellow lately.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.486
I have a very good feeling
about him.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.089
He could really
shake things up
around here.

12:02.155 --> 12:05.425
And he's got
a very good understanding
of what people want...

12:05.492 --> 12:06.894
Because he's one of them.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.896
One of who?
He's a normie.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.831
A normie?
As the HOHOHO?

12:10.898 --> 12:12.365
That's insane.
Well, maybe a little.

12:12.432 --> 12:15.102
Which is why
I need to make sure
he's got what it takes.

12:15.168 --> 12:18.371
So I need someone
to test him out for me.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.807
Hmm?

12:19.873 --> 12:22.375
See, I'm doing this
because I mean you.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.745
I know you mean me.
But I can't do that, Santa.
Sure, you can.

12:25.813 --> 12:29.316
All you need to do is determine
if he's got the qualities
I'm looking for...

12:29.382 --> 12:32.319
Without letting him know
who you are or why you're there.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.087
Oh, is that all?
No.

12:34.154 --> 12:37.124
Then you need to convince him
to leave his normie life
at home...

12:37.190 --> 12:38.959
And move to the North Pole.
Piece of cake.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.693
Santa, I can't.
I just can't.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.429
I have a lot of faith
in you, Billie.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.431
You are incredibly clever.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.766
And you'll have
no trouble at all
fitting in over there.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.837
Because... Well, yes.

12:49.903 --> 12:52.239
Because that's
what makes you special.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.675
Here.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.845
Take this with you.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.481
Twixel's bell?

13:01.548 --> 13:05.252
Only use North Pole magic
when you absolutely have to.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.388
We must be very careful
what we do in their world.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.257
I don't know
what to say.

13:10.323 --> 13:13.760
Say you'll give it
your best shot.
That's all I can ask.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.395
Who wants cookies?

13:15.462 --> 13:18.665
Oh-ho.
No, no, no, Mrs. C.
We just finished a workout.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.333
Perfect time for a reward.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.836
I can't have my man
wasting away to nothing.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.305
There, skinny.
Take a few for later.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.407
Mm-hmm.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.909
That's my man.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.211
Hmm?
[Scoffs]
No.

13:40.787 --> 13:43.556
Oh, Billie.
I really don't feel like
a cookie right now, Mrs. Claus.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.625
Oh, it's not cookies
I wanted to talk to you about.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.294
Oh.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.897
I know what's going on
between you and Mr. Claus.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.201
Mrs. Claus, I love your husband,
but I would never...

13:54.267 --> 13:56.369
[Laughing]
Oh! No, silly.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.406
I meant, I wanted to talk
about the HOHOHO position.

13:59.472 --> 14:02.475
What do you mean?
I know you're disappointed that
you're not being considered.

14:02.542 --> 14:06.980
No, I...
But you have to know
how much we value you here.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.216
Santa picked you
to see if the normie...

14:09.282 --> 14:10.951
Had the particulars
he's looking for...

14:11.018 --> 14:13.586
Because he trusts you
completely.

14:15.722 --> 14:19.726
Thank you for saying that,
but I would never have assumed...

14:19.792 --> 14:22.729
And there's another beautiful
quality we love about you.

14:22.795 --> 14:25.899
Santa's pretty good at matching
the person to the task.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.334
I've noticed.

14:27.400 --> 14:31.271
He's pretty cute too.
[Giggling]
Yeah.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.806
Safe travels, my dear.
Thanks, Mrs. Claus.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.976
Oh! Please call me...

14:37.144 --> 14:40.680
Well... Mrs. Claus.

14:40.747 --> 14:42.615
[Chuckles]

14:51.258 --> 14:53.961
The Peppermint Portal
is almost ready
for your journey.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.163
Unfortunately,
we lost an elf yesterday,

14:56.229 --> 14:58.131
But I think
we're okay now.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.967
- Are you serious?
- Of course not!

15:01.234 --> 15:03.036
I've transported
1,100 elves,

15:03.103 --> 15:05.672
And almost all of them
have come back safe.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.941
Kidding again!
[Laughs]

15:08.008 --> 15:10.377
You're in good hands.
Hop on.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.182
And just where
are you off to?

15:15.248 --> 15:17.250
That's really none
of your business, Eleanor.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.253
Oh, but it will be,
once I become the new HOHOHO.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.955
[Softly]
Don't hold your breath.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.391
- What was that?
- I said you're so blessed.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.726
Don't get smart with me,
round ears.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.396
Santa may take pity on you,
but I know what you really are.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.898
- A freak.
- Oh, yeah?
Tell that to Rudolph.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.400
[Laughs]
Burn.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.404
Because Rudolph is...
At your service, ma'am.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.974
Rudolph at least made
something of himself.

15:41.041 --> 15:44.344
What are you?
A trainer
and a dateless wonder.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.579
As much as I'm enjoying
this stimulating dialogue...

15:47.647 --> 15:49.316

16:03.330 --> 16:04.931
So, Fitzy, where's she going?

16:04.998 --> 16:09.502
Uh, that is privileged
transporter and transportee
information.

16:09.569 --> 16:13.373
And the chances of you
getting that information
from me...

16:13.440 --> 16:15.075
Are zero...

16:15.142 --> 16:18.345
As my tolerance for pain
is extremely high.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.182
Right. Right.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.586
[Chuckles]

16:29.556 --> 16:32.592

[Doorbell Ringing]

17:01.054 --> 17:02.555
What?

17:02.622 --> 17:04.723
Mr. Ardwick.
I'm Harvey Ward from
True National Mortgage.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.792
We've been having
a hard time reaching you.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.296
That's 'cause I don't answer
the phone when you call.
That would explain it.

17:09.362 --> 17:13.300
Well, anyway, it's my duty
to inform you that unless your
debts are settled immediately,

17:13.366 --> 17:16.935
We will be foreclosing
on your house.
How long do I have?

17:17.002 --> 17:19.406
At this point,
it's really a matter
of getting the paperwork done.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.309
I strongly suggest
you find a new place to live
as soon as possible.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.943
But it's almost Christmas.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.978
My favorite time of year.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.516
Which means they'll probably
want to get the paperwork
finished way before then.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.684
You might want
to face the facts,
Mr. Ardwick.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.321
You've been living
well beyond your means
for quite a while,

17:34.387 --> 17:36.656
And now you're screwed.

17:39.292 --> 17:42.229
[Lock Clicks]
Merry Christmas.

[Doorbell Ringing]

17:54.174 --> 17:55.742

17:55.808 --> 17:59.512
Gotta hand it to you, Harv.
You are one pain in the a...

18:02.149 --> 18:03.783
Well, hello there.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.653
- Dax Ardwick?
- Absolutely.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.190
- May I come in?
- Absolutely.

18:19.399 --> 18:22.135
You'll have to excuse my attire.
You caught me on a day off.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.736
From what?
Cleaning?

18:23.803 --> 18:27.207
- [Chuckles]
That's very funny, Miss...
- Billie is fine.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.875
Billie is fine.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.977
Did you just...
I did not.

18:31.043 --> 18:32.879
Look, you're probably
more bad news,

18:32.945 --> 18:35.915
But you are by far
the best-looking bad news
I've seen all week.

18:35.982 --> 18:39.018
Mr. Ardwick,
I represent a certain...

18:39.085 --> 18:40.853
High-profile individual...

18:40.920 --> 18:44.090
Who has asked me to approach you
about an extremely important
position...

18:44.157 --> 18:46.926
Which needs to be
filled immediately.
Somebody wants to hire me?

18:46.993 --> 18:49.496
I mean...

18:49.562 --> 18:51.198
I'm currently fielding
other offers,

18:51.264 --> 18:53.266
But I could always listen
to what you have to say.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.503
So you're a headhunter?

18:56.569 --> 18:59.339
Something like that.
And what type of job
is it exactly?

18:59.406 --> 19:01.474
The position would be directly
under the boss himself.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.743
So vice president?
I guess you could say that.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.378
Nice!
Who's the boss?

19:06.579 --> 19:08.281
I can't say.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.683
What type of
business is it?
I can't say.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.220
Will there be
stock options?
I can't say.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.954
What can you say?

19:15.021 --> 19:18.925
My employer is...
different than what
you're probably used to.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.294
If you want this position,
you're going to have
to prove yourself first.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.663
Prove myself? How?

19:23.730 --> 19:26.132
He sent me here
to see if you have
the traits he requires.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.201
So I'll put you through
a series of tests,

19:28.268 --> 19:30.303
And if you impress me,

19:30.370 --> 19:33.039
Then I would provide you
with the information necessary.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.641
I get it.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.743
It's usually those big time,
eccentric bosses...

19:36.809 --> 19:39.212
That like all this secrecy
and hurdle-jumping stuff.

19:39.279 --> 19:42.215
Is this guy
single-name famous?
You could definitely say that.

19:42.282 --> 19:46.118
Then you definitely
have my attention.
Okay. Let's get started.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.020
Now?
Is that going
to be a problem?

19:48.087 --> 19:51.291
Well, I'll have to
make some calls,
rearrange my schedule...

19:51.358 --> 19:53.726
Put on some pants.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.462
Put on some pants.

this isn't a company car.

It's very efficient.
Efficiency is important
to this job.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.348
Of course. Yeah.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.116
I like this car.

20:17.183 --> 20:20.119
Where are you from?

20:20.186 --> 20:22.188
Up north.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.690
Okay.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.626
Your first test is to show me
how you handle conflicts,

20:26.693 --> 20:29.296
Solve problems
and use your
negotiation skills...

20:29.362 --> 20:31.464
While maintaining
an even temper.

20:31.531 --> 20:35.935
So it's a series of challenges
for an important position.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.605
Of course.
It's got The Donald
written all over it.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.239
It's Trump.
You work for Trump,
right?

20:40.307 --> 20:42.241
Wrong.

to stop here.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.257
This isn't the friendliest
of neighborhoods.

20:58.325 --> 21:02.161
I want you to go inside
and tell them you dinged
one of their bikes.

21:02.228 --> 21:03.730
No, seriously.
We should leave.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.432
Once you reach
a peaceful resolution,

21:05.498 --> 21:07.800
You can come out
and show them
there's no damage.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.436
I'll be waiting.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.738
There's no way
I'm doing that.
They'll kill me.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.073
Not if you have the skills
needed for the job
we're offering.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.075
Remember,
cooler heads prevail.

21:16.142 --> 21:20.847

that you're pursuing one
of your many other offers.

21:25.084 --> 21:28.020

23:27.774 --> 23:29.676

here, all right?

Whoa! Whoa.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.492
Don't make me use this.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.330
Maybe you're looking
for a new member?

23:51.397 --> 23:54.166
I love your goatee.

23:59.371 --> 24:00.907

24:42.915 --> 24:45.852
Not a particularly
impressive beginning.
Hey, they started it.

24:45.918 --> 24:48.788
It's not about who starts it,
it's about not trying
to finish it.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.322
You have to learn
to control your temper.

24:50.389 --> 24:52.258
That part of the job?

24:52.324 --> 24:54.794
Turning the other cheek
when a bunch of bikers
are about to rearrange my face?

24:54.861 --> 24:57.429
It's a part of any job.
Don't fight.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.466
Are you kidding me?
My life was in danger.

25:00.533 --> 25:04.070
- I would never have let
something happen to you.
- Oh, I feel better already.

25:04.136 --> 25:07.239

What are you, like, 90 pounds?

25:07.306 --> 25:09.375

How did I get out
of that place anyway?

25:09.441 --> 25:12.478
That's not important.
Okay, we need to focus
on the next test.

wimping out on me.

throw you off your game.

it would be funny.

Oh. You do have
a sense of humor.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.430

to wonder.

25:31.497 --> 25:32.999
Well.

25:35.702 --> 25:38.370
You know,
I just realized,

25:38.437 --> 25:41.040
You don't have a single
Christmas decoration in here.

25:41.107 --> 25:43.009
Not one.

25:43.075 --> 25:46.979
Christmas isn't exactly
my favorite time of year.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.816
Are you serious?

25:49.882 --> 25:53.552
When I was growing up,
the other kids would
decorate trees,

25:53.620 --> 25:55.054
Carol with their family,

25:55.121 --> 25:56.989
Open presents
on Christmas Day.

25:57.056 --> 26:00.159
Me, not so much.

26:00.226 --> 26:03.029
I can't remember
the last time
I got a present.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.667
Cuban!

26:07.734 --> 26:11.203
It's got a whole Cuban-y vibe.
The whole "trial by fire" thing.
Am I right?

26:11.270 --> 26:13.673
I'm afraid not.
Let's just move on
to the next task.

26:13.740 --> 26:17.043
Wait.
One last question.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.778
Why me?

26:18.845 --> 26:21.213
I'm still trying
to figure that one out.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.850
Well, when you do
figure it out,
let me know.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.052
I'm going
to take a shower.

26:26.118 --> 26:27.787
Fine.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.089

26:40.667 --> 26:42.501
Fitzy?

26:42.568 --> 26:44.170
What are you doing here?

26:44.236 --> 26:47.573
And why are you
dressed like Santa?

26:47.640 --> 26:50.142
- Where am I?
- Between the poles.

26:50.209 --> 26:55.081
- Why are you here?
- This? This is
between the poles?

26:55.147 --> 26:59.185
I mean, I've been sending
elves back and forth
for almost 50 years,

26:59.251 --> 27:01.921
And I've never actually
taken the journey myself.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.656
I didn't think
it was safe.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.358
Kidding. Sort of.

27:06.425 --> 27:09.328
I rang for Santa.
Ah.

27:09.395 --> 27:12.932
Well, I was adjusting
the teleportation frequency
capacitance...

27:12.999 --> 27:17.436
And, well, one thing
led to another...

27:17.503 --> 27:19.105
And here I am.

27:19.171 --> 27:21.640
And why are you
wearing Santa's clothes?

27:21.708 --> 27:23.876
Why do you think...

27:23.943 --> 27:25.678
These aren't Santa's.

27:26.578 --> 27:27.780
Okay, fine.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.882
Sometimes when Santa
goes to sleep,

27:29.949 --> 27:31.718
I put on
one of his shirts.

27:31.784 --> 27:32.985
And his hat.

27:37.056 --> 27:38.657
And his hat.

27:39.458 --> 27:41.493
And-And then I...

27:41.560 --> 27:44.663
I sit behind his desk
and I imagine...

27:44.731 --> 27:46.999
What it would be like to...

27:49.769 --> 27:52.404
To bring so much joy
to all those children.

27:53.472 --> 27:55.107
Fitz.

27:55.174 --> 27:58.510
Am I in trouble?
Your secret is safe with me,
but don't ever...

27:58.577 --> 28:00.079
I... I promise.

28:00.146 --> 28:02.815
I will never transport
another Frappuccino.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.650
Kidding!
[Chuckles]

28:04.717 --> 28:06.986

are his own. Duh!

28:07.053 --> 28:09.021
Mm, okay.
Later, Fitzy.

28:10.656 --> 28:12.825
He's one of a kind,
isn't he?

28:12.892 --> 28:14.827
- You knew?
- Santa knows.

28:14.894 --> 28:17.830
Does Santa also know that
Dax is never gonna qualify
for this job?

28:17.897 --> 28:19.732
Why would you say that?

28:19.799 --> 28:21.968
He doesn't possess one
of the five qualities
you're looking for.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.470
Billie, he just started.

28:24.536 --> 28:28.474
But two minutes ago he said,
"Christmas isn't exactly
my favorite time of year."

28:28.540 --> 28:31.310
- Yes, but...
- And he must have read
my mind when he asked me,

28:31.377 --> 28:32.812
"Why me?"
[Scoffs]

28:32.879 --> 28:34.613
It just doesn't
make any sense.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.884
Maybe instead of
wondering why him,

28:37.950 --> 28:40.586
You should be asking,
"Why not him?"

28:40.652 --> 28:43.555
I can think of a dozen reasons.
Santa, why did you choose him?

28:43.622 --> 28:48.094
Sometimes making the choice
that makes the least sense
makes the most sense.

28:49.261 --> 28:50.930
Um, not helping.

28:50.997 --> 28:54.801
Billie, when you give
good people possibility,

28:54.867 --> 28:57.336
They do great things.

28:57.403 --> 29:00.940
Please speak to me
in simple North Pole lingo.

29:01.007 --> 29:05.077
Billie, the truth about
human character...

29:05.144 --> 29:07.713
Will always reveal itself.

29:07.780 --> 29:10.016
I think inside Dax...

29:10.082 --> 29:12.684
Is a man
of great character.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.086
Hmm?

in danger again?

- I know.

"True humility is not
thinking less of yourself...

yourself less"?

It's called
"thinking on your feet."
Impressed?

36:09.435 --> 36:12.371
That you came up with something
to cover up for the problem
you created in the first place?

36:12.438 --> 36:14.240
Well, when you
put it like that.

36:14.306 --> 36:15.774
Your temper is becoming
an issue of concern.

36:15.841 --> 36:18.977
Hey, for the record,
I didn't fight
one single kid.

36:19.044 --> 36:20.879
[Scoffs]
Oh, my God. Really?

36:20.946 --> 36:23.114

this seriously at all.

[Sighs]

36:24.916 --> 36:28.820
I'm sorry, really.
But you've got to
cut me some slack.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.522
I'm doing all this
without any guarantees.

36:30.589 --> 36:32.524
I'm not exactly
in my comfort zone.

36:35.594 --> 36:38.530
Well, you did manage
to keep focus on the job
you needed to do,

36:38.597 --> 36:41.633
Regardless of your...
humiliating outfit.

I'll admit the birthday boy
really had it coming.
I know, right?

36:50.576 --> 36:53.779
Yeah. Okay, fine.
I'll give you this one.

36:55.281 --> 36:58.250
Now go get out of
that ridiculous costume
and meet me back here.

36:58.317 --> 37:01.152

Go.

Go! Don't...

What a joke.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.032
So you're my competition.

Pitiful.

I thought I nailed it.

elves in the jungle?

Do you really think
you're more qualified
for the job than me?

I don't think...
Yes, you don't think.

37:23.642 --> 37:26.612
Because if you did,
you'd realize this job
belongs to me.

my entire life.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.216

I just put the suit on

was bad, but... [Groans]

with your normie logic, okay?

You might want to set some
higher goals for yourself.

37:57.208 --> 38:00.346
Look, I will leave
your dad's suit
in here for you, okay?

38:00.412 --> 38:02.748
Oh. One word of advice...

38:02.814 --> 38:05.050
If it gets
out of hand out there,
just start a food fight.

Oh! Some kid puked big time

A normie can't be
the HOHOHO.

38:38.417 --> 38:39.918
It's simply not possible.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.787
There's nothing in the rules
that says he can't.

I'll be looking into
these so-called rules.
Believe you me.

46:37.662 --> 46:39.664
* Jingle all the way *

46:39.730 --> 46:41.900
So, only one more test,
and that's it?
The job's mine?

46:41.967 --> 46:44.870
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves. We have to
see how you do first.

46:44.936 --> 46:46.804
Then weigh that with your
previous performances.

46:46.872 --> 46:49.207
And you're telling me
all this is gonna be
worth the effort?

46:49.274 --> 46:53.244
This job provides
rewards that are...

46:53.311 --> 46:54.712
Immeasurable.

46:54.779 --> 46:57.048
I like the sound of that.

46:57.115 --> 46:59.117
This last test isn't
gonna be easy though.

46:59.184 --> 47:01.119
Wait, the others
were supposed to be easy?

47:01.186 --> 47:03.354
Think of them
as a warm-up.

47:03.421 --> 47:06.424
Now I'm gonna need you
to show me the very best
version of yourself.

47:08.894 --> 47:12.197
* O'er the fields we go *

47:12.263 --> 47:15.266
* Laughing all the way *

47:15.333 --> 47:17.335
Does that place mean
something to you?

47:17.402 --> 47:20.171
Just a business deal.
It's none of my business
anymore.

47:23.074 --> 47:25.977
* Oh, what fun it is to ride *

47:26.044 --> 47:29.814
* And sing a sleighing song
tonight *

47:29.881 --> 47:33.184
* Jingle bells, jingle bells *

47:33.251 --> 47:36.754
* Jingle all the way *

47:36.821 --> 47:38.623
* Oh, what fun it is to ride *

47:38.689 --> 47:41.326
Dax,
we have a problem.

47:41.392 --> 47:45.931
You're falling for me,
and it scares you?
Please. Give it a rest.

47:53.071 --> 47:56.341
I thought I had one of those
roadside assistance cards.

47:57.408 --> 47:59.210
Hey, where'd you
find that stuff?

47:59.911 --> 48:01.446
In the car.

48:01.512 --> 48:04.315
Do you want me to figure out
how to put that thing on?

48:04.382 --> 48:05.750
No. It's fine.

48:05.816 --> 48:07.785
But it's a man's job.

48:07.852 --> 48:10.621
Where I'm from,
we don't differentiate
between male and female.

48:10.688 --> 48:12.924
We work together, as equals.

48:12.991 --> 48:16.194
I knew it!
I knew you weren't
from here.

48:16.261 --> 48:18.363
There's something different
about you, Billie.

48:18.429 --> 48:20.698
I've dated a lot of women.
[Creaking]

48:20.765 --> 48:23.868
- Obviously.
I mean, look at me.
- Off the car!

48:23.935 --> 48:26.171
But you...

48:26.237 --> 48:27.772
You seem...
I don't know.

48:27.838 --> 48:30.275
You operate at a different
rhythm than any girl
I've ever met.

48:30.341 --> 48:34.112
It's like you're
from a different planet
or something.

48:34.179 --> 48:36.081
A beautiful planet.

48:39.951 --> 48:41.719
Um, same planet.

48:41.786 --> 48:43.654
I don't know
anything about you.

48:43.721 --> 48:46.357
- I...
- I don't even know
your last name.

48:46.424 --> 48:50.295
I assume you have a last name,
or are you like Pink?

48:51.963 --> 48:53.498
All right.

48:58.436 --> 49:02.140
What do you want to know?
For starters,
what's your last name?

49:02.907 --> 49:06.344
It's, uh, Gene?

49:06.411 --> 49:09.680
Billie's last name
is Gene?
Yeah.

49:09.747 --> 49:12.517
You must have been
really teased when
that song came out.

49:12.583 --> 49:13.951
What song?
The Mi...

49:14.019 --> 49:17.355
Doesn't matter.
Next question... Do you
have a man in your life?

49:17.422 --> 49:20.525
Uh, it didn't work out.
What happened?

49:20.591 --> 49:23.461
Um, the usual.

49:23.528 --> 49:25.730
Yeah. Let me guess.

49:25.796 --> 49:28.333
He said,
"It's not you, it's me."

49:28.399 --> 49:30.068
Or was it,

49:30.135 --> 49:33.004
"You're too good for me.
I'll just hold you back."

49:33.071 --> 49:34.539
Or my favorite,
"We had fun.

49:34.605 --> 49:37.975
But a smart girl knows when
to leave a sinking ship."

49:38.043 --> 49:41.146
- That's mean.
- Yeah, I thought it was.

49:41.212 --> 49:43.914
- Any more questions?
- Yeah.

49:43.981 --> 49:46.051
How long's this gonna take?
I'm hungry.

49:47.018 --> 49:50.321
[Man]
* Silent night *

49:51.856 --> 49:55.260
* Holy night *

49:56.761 --> 50:00.631
* All is calm *

50:01.799 --> 50:05.336
* All is bright *

50:06.637 --> 50:09.274
[Billie Gasps]
A hot dog cart!
I gotta have one.

50:09.340 --> 50:11.609
- Do you want?
- No, thanks.

50:11.676 --> 50:14.445
I'm gonna stretch,
get some feeling back
in my legs.

50:17.148 --> 50:21.619
* Holy infant **

50:23.488 --> 50:26.957
[Man Coughing,
Groaning]

50:27.024 --> 50:29.026
Hello?

50:29.094 --> 50:31.296
[Groaning Continues]

50:33.131 --> 50:34.732
[Coughs]

50:36.101 --> 50:38.236
All right.
Keep sleeping it off, alkie.

50:38.303 --> 50:41.339
I'm not drunk.
[Grunts]

50:41.406 --> 50:44.642
[Bottles Clattering]
I've been mugged.

50:44.709 --> 50:46.411
No, no, no.
What is it?

50:46.477 --> 50:48.479
My great-great-grandfather's
ring.

50:48.546 --> 50:52.450
I was to have passed it down
to my son on his birthday.

50:52.517 --> 50:54.752
I don't care about
the money at all,

50:54.819 --> 50:56.387
But that ring...

50:56.454 --> 50:58.289
That ring was priceless
to me.

50:58.356 --> 51:00.391
You need me to call
the cops or anything?

51:01.492 --> 51:04.295
I-I'll manage.
Thank you for stopping.

51:04.362 --> 51:06.297
Not many
would've done so.

51:06.364 --> 51:08.533
Sure you're okay?
Yes, thank you.

51:19.177 --> 51:21.846
Ooh, yeah.

51:23.248 --> 51:25.450
It's not my problem.

51:25.516 --> 51:28.419
[Singsongy]
It's not my problem.

51:29.854 --> 51:31.389
[Sighs]

51:32.423 --> 51:34.159
Hey.

51:37.695 --> 51:40.398
- What do you want?
- Keep the wallet.
Just give me the ring, okay?

51:41.366 --> 51:43.901
- Is he for real?
- Totally real.

51:43.968 --> 51:47.138
I'd really like
that ring back.

51:47.205 --> 51:49.574
What are you
gonna do about it?

51:51.442 --> 51:54.145
Do you really
want to find out?

51:57.448 --> 51:59.049
Fine.

51:59.116 --> 52:01.819
Whatever, man.
The thing's super ugly anyway.

52:12.997 --> 52:14.899
I got something
for you.

52:17.268 --> 52:19.370
Oh, but how?
Found it on the ground
over there.

52:20.905 --> 52:23.341
Thank you. Thank you.

52:23.408 --> 52:26.211
Don't worry about it.
It's no big deal.

52:26.277 --> 52:28.179
I won't forget this.

52:28.246 --> 52:30.781
Tell your son
happy birthday.

52:37.522 --> 52:39.524
Come on, let's get
to that last test.

52:39.590 --> 52:42.159
That will not
be necessary.

52:42.227 --> 52:44.429
You just passed it.
I did?

52:44.495 --> 52:47.164
My boss places a lot of value
on special acts of kindness,

52:47.232 --> 52:48.666
Especially toward strangers.

52:49.667 --> 52:51.302
Wait a minute.

52:51.369 --> 52:54.439
Does that mean you're...
Impressed? Yes, Dax.

52:54.505 --> 52:56.474
I'm impressed.
Does that mean
I got the job?

52:56.541 --> 52:58.309
It means you qualify
for the job.

52:58.376 --> 53:01.346
The final decision
is up to the boss himself.
What was his name again?

53:03.013 --> 53:04.515
Nice try.

53:14.259 --> 53:16.661
[Engine Starts]

53:24.502 --> 53:27.638
To Dax,
who's come a long way
in a short time.

53:27.705 --> 53:29.274
Thanks.

53:29.340 --> 53:31.776
Just tell me this...
Is it a Fortune 500 company?

53:31.842 --> 53:34.078
Dax.
NASDAQ? New York stock exchange?

53:34.144 --> 53:35.480
Dax.
It's Murdoch, isn't it?

53:35.546 --> 53:38.816
No.
Come on. Just tell me.

53:41.151 --> 53:42.753
It's Santa.

53:42.820 --> 53:44.789
Sorry. What is it?

53:44.855 --> 53:47.124
Your new boss is Santa.

53:47.191 --> 53:49.560
Santa Claus.
[Chuckles]
Good one.

53:49.627 --> 53:52.229
Who is it, really?
It's really Santa Claus.

53:52.297 --> 53:54.164
Kriss Kringle.
St. Nicholas himself.

53:54.231 --> 53:56.667
Billie, why are you...
The woman you met at
the birthday party...

53:56.734 --> 53:59.337
She's your competition.
She is an elf.

53:59.404 --> 54:02.307
Oh, this story just
gets better and better.
Come on! Stop joking.

54:02.373 --> 54:05.510
I'm dead serious.
Okay.

54:05.576 --> 54:08.279
Look, I understand
this is really hard
for you to believe.

54:08.346 --> 54:10.715
Hard to believe?
Did Lane put you up to this?

54:10.781 --> 54:13.150
Is this some sort of prank?
No, Santa put me up to this.

54:13.217 --> 54:15.620
He wanted to make sure
you qualified
for the position.

54:15.686 --> 54:18.022
Santa put...
What position?

54:18.088 --> 54:20.991
The vice president of Christmas?
Ho, ho, ho! Very funny!

54:21.058 --> 54:24.295
Dax, haven't you ever heard
of "Santa's little helper"?
The dog from The Simpsons?

54:24.362 --> 54:26.864
It's a nickname
for the Head Office Herald
of Holiday Operations.

54:26.931 --> 54:29.099
It's the second
most important job
in the North Pole.

54:29.166 --> 54:32.637
Of course! Yeah.
I suppose next you're gonna
tell me you're an elf.

54:32.703 --> 54:34.605
Yeah, I am.
Sure, you are.

54:34.672 --> 54:37.308
Yeah. A tall elf!
And where's your
pointy ears, huh?

54:37.375 --> 54:40.244
Okay, you know what?
Elves come in all different
shapes and sizes,

54:40.311 --> 54:41.746
Just like normies do.
Normies?

54:41.812 --> 54:44.014
And my ears aren't pointed
because...

54:45.483 --> 54:47.618
I was born
with a genetic defect.

54:47.685 --> 54:49.787
It's rare, but it happens.

54:49.854 --> 54:53.157
Billie... if that's even
your name... look around.

54:53.223 --> 54:55.993
The bank's gonna
take all of this.
I don't have a plan "B."

54:56.060 --> 54:58.996
I believed there was a job
because I had to believe it.

54:59.063 --> 55:02.299
I'm not lying.
There is a job,
and it's a great one.

55:02.367 --> 55:05.069
As the HOHOHO.
Oh! Up in the North Pole?

55:05.135 --> 55:07.705
Surrounded by gumdrops
and gingerbread men?
Yes.

55:07.772 --> 55:10.975
Wow! How did I...
How did I not see this coming?

55:11.041 --> 55:13.310
You need to calm down.
Calm down? Calm down?

55:13.378 --> 55:16.514
Do not make me use this.

55:16.581 --> 55:19.149
A bell?
You're gonna threaten me
with a bell?

55:19.216 --> 55:22.687
Don't you get it?
My life is over!

55:22.753 --> 55:24.922
[Rings]

55:28.258 --> 55:30.728
Don't talk.

55:30.795 --> 55:32.597
Don't think.

55:32.663 --> 55:34.699
If we are going
to get anywhere,

55:34.765 --> 55:36.767
You're going to have to
start listening to me...

55:36.834 --> 55:40.471
Because I have a lot
of things to tell you,
okay?

55:40.538 --> 55:42.940
Cheer up, Dax.
Go to your happy place.

55:43.007 --> 55:45.610
I don't have a happy place.
I don't have a job.
I don't have money.

55:45.676 --> 55:47.545
I don't have anything!

55:48.713 --> 55:50.948
There's a lot more
where that came from.

55:51.015 --> 55:52.817
[Rings]

55:54.251 --> 55:56.654
[Doorbell Ringing]

55:56.721 --> 55:59.490
You might want
to get that.

56:04.529 --> 56:06.664
[Groans]
Oops.

56:20.845 --> 56:22.447
Evening, Dax.

56:22.513 --> 56:24.815
Wait. I know you.

56:24.882 --> 56:26.984
You're the guy
from the youth center.

56:27.051 --> 56:30.421
I am.
May I come in?

56:36.794 --> 56:39.864
I knew
beyond a shadow of a doubt
that you were my man...

56:39.930 --> 56:42.266
When you got that ring
back for me.

56:42.332 --> 56:44.469
Wait. That was you too?

56:45.870 --> 56:48.172
[Different Voice]
I won't forget this.

56:48.238 --> 56:50.775
So freaky.

56:50.841 --> 56:53.711
As Billie said,
"You've come a long way."

56:55.012 --> 56:57.448
And that...
that little bell thingy
did all that?

56:57.515 --> 57:01.285
North Pole magic
is what powers Christmas, Dax.

57:01.351 --> 57:03.454
It can do almost anything.

57:03.521 --> 57:05.122
I still don't understand.

57:05.189 --> 57:08.358
Out of all the people
in the world, why me?

57:08.425 --> 57:11.095
Come with me,

57:11.161 --> 57:13.063
And I'll show you.

57:19.804 --> 57:22.339
You remember this place,
don't you?

57:22.406 --> 57:25.109
Hope Springs Youth Center.
You spent a lot of time
in this building.

57:25.175 --> 57:28.178
Parents weren't around much.
I hung around here more
than I did at home.

57:28.245 --> 57:33.083
I think it's safe to say you
were a bit of a troublemaker
before you started coming here.

57:33.150 --> 57:36.186
This building
had quite an effect
on you, didn't it?

57:37.354 --> 57:39.156
Come on.
Let's take a look.

57:41.759 --> 57:44.161
Three months of rehearsals
down the drain...

57:44.228 --> 57:47.532
Because somebody thought
he needed the money...

57:47.598 --> 57:50.134
More than us.

57:50.200 --> 57:51.602
Dax Ardwick.

57:51.669 --> 57:53.337
I didn't take it.

57:53.403 --> 57:56.340
Well, the only people
who had access to it
were you, Tommy and Mike.

57:56.406 --> 57:58.609
They both
have airtight alibis,

57:58.676 --> 58:00.344
Leaving only one
other possibility.

58:00.410 --> 58:01.946
You.

58:04.281 --> 58:05.916
I didn't do it.

58:08.853 --> 58:12.089
I love this play.
I love this place.

58:12.156 --> 58:14.992
Says the dirt-poor kid
who actually asked
to be treasurer...

58:15.059 --> 58:17.161
Of the Christmas show
charity fund?

58:17.227 --> 58:19.564
Come on.
You can all go.

58:20.397 --> 58:23.033
Thanks a lot.

58:23.100 --> 58:26.103
Way to ruin it
for the rest of us.

58:26.170 --> 58:28.539
Guys, it wasn't me.

58:36.413 --> 58:38.783
If Tommy and Mike
didn't do it,

58:38.849 --> 58:40.985
And I know
I didn't do it,

58:42.653 --> 58:45.389
That means you did.

58:45.455 --> 58:48.826
I know.
[Laughing]

58:48.893 --> 58:50.761
Good luck proving that,
Sherlock.

58:50.828 --> 58:52.630
Who's gonna believe you?

58:52.697 --> 58:56.000
I've seen punks like you
come and go, and they always
amount to nothing,

58:56.066 --> 58:59.670
No matter how hard
they try to rise above
their pathetic DNA.

59:01.772 --> 59:03.908
Why are you
doing this to me?

59:03.974 --> 59:08.012
[Sighs]
Life's full
of disappointments, kid.

59:08.078 --> 59:10.014
Get used to it.

59:19.990 --> 59:22.593
It's the same jerk
that just stole
the center's money.

59:22.660 --> 59:25.129
And your compassion
for others.

59:25.195 --> 59:28.465
That was the moment
you stopped trusting
other people,

59:28.532 --> 59:32.970
Became closed off
and started caring
only about yourself.

59:33.037 --> 59:37.407
The center said they wouldn't
press charges if I agreed to
leave and never come back.

59:37.474 --> 59:40.244
So I did.
I know.

59:40.310 --> 59:43.147
I learned a very valuable
lesson that day.

59:43.213 --> 59:45.616
People are only
gonna let you down.

59:45.683 --> 59:48.886
Well, turns out
that lesson...

59:48.953 --> 59:53.057
Became a significant loss
to the rest of the world.

59:53.123 --> 59:56.560
What do you mean?
If you had kept your heart
open to others,

59:56.627 --> 59:59.296
You would have
realized your dream
and become an astronaut.

59:59.363 --> 01:00:02.332
Dax Ardwick would have
become a household name.

01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:05.169
You would have made millions
in product endorsements.

01:00:05.235 --> 01:00:07.872
Whether orbiting the Earth
or walking around the block,

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:10.841
I always start my day
with Dax Flax.

01:00:10.908 --> 01:00:13.678
Stay healthy.
Travel strong.

01:00:13.744 --> 01:00:16.647
With Flax from Dax.

01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:21.251
You would have met
a wonderful woman,
had two beautiful children.

01:00:21.318 --> 01:00:23.688
[Laughing]

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:43.741
You would have used
the science of zero gravity...

01:00:43.808 --> 01:00:47.477
And discovered a cure
for the common cold.

01:00:47.544 --> 01:00:50.080
[Monitor Beeping]

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:58.055
Oh, yeah.
And for a couple of weeks,

01:00:58.122 --> 01:01:01.158
You would've been a greeter
at a famous clothing store.

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:05.262
How's your day going?

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:13.070
You were capable
of amazing things, Dax,

01:01:13.137 --> 01:01:17.674
Because you used to believe
that anything was possible.

01:01:17.742 --> 01:01:20.010
That's my life?
Mm-hmm.

01:01:20.077 --> 01:01:22.346
Use your North Pole magic
to give me that life!

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:24.348
Oh, I can't.

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:26.516
It ceased to exist...

01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:31.388
When you closed yourself off
and stopped caring about others.

01:01:31.455 --> 01:01:32.990
So...

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.226
It's too late?

01:01:36.293 --> 01:01:38.628
It's never too late
to make a new start,

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:41.298
To find your best self.

01:01:44.668 --> 01:01:46.203
Hmm?

01:01:48.773 --> 01:01:50.741
[Water Splashing]

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:59.383
Well! Th-That's my face.

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:01.085
And you know
what they say?

01:02:01.151 --> 01:02:03.788
When in Rome,
do as the normies do.

01:02:07.357 --> 01:02:10.160
How does this guy
figure out what to wear?

01:02:11.161 --> 01:02:14.765
Ugh. This normie life
is complicated.

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:20.737
** [Up-tempo
Instrumental Intro]

01:02:20.805 --> 01:02:22.472
Whoo!

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:25.409
Yeah.

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:27.912
* She's got her girlfriends
on the phone *

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:30.047
* Saying, "Don't be late" *

01:02:30.114 --> 01:02:32.016
Fitz?

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:34.218
* She shows up before
the band *

01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:37.955
* 'Cause she just can't wait *

01:02:38.022 --> 01:02:41.091
- What happened
to your beard?
- Well, I thought...

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:43.427
Where are your elf clothes,
and what are you doing here?

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:46.964
That is a good question.
That is actually
two good questions.

01:02:47.031 --> 01:02:49.233
Is that Dax's shirt?

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:51.601
Hmm?
And tie?

01:02:51.668 --> 01:02:53.637
And sunglasses?

01:02:53.703 --> 01:02:57.674
Fitz, why... are...
you... here?

01:02:57.741 --> 01:03:00.811
Where is your beard?
Why are you wearing
Dax's clothes?

01:03:00.878 --> 01:03:03.647
Because Dax is
a pretty incredible guy.

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:06.216
Maybe he is.
Oh, I know he is.

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:08.618
Turns out we have way more
in common that I thought.

01:03:08.685 --> 01:03:11.188
I transport elves
across space.

01:03:11.255 --> 01:03:14.658
He's always wanted
to travel through space
as an astronaut.

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:16.593
Plus, he used to work
at a youth center,

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.864
Bringing hope and joy
to all those children,
only he did it all year round.

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:22.166
We have very similar stuff.

01:03:22.232 --> 01:03:23.567
Fitz.

01:03:25.169 --> 01:03:29.006
Do not change one thing
about yourself.

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:33.844
You're an amazing,
thoughtful, smart,

01:03:33.911 --> 01:03:36.446
Compassionate elf.

01:03:36.513 --> 01:03:38.515
Really?
Really.

01:03:43.921 --> 01:03:46.390
Now, go use
some North Pole magic.

01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:48.558
Get yourself back
to the Fitz we love.

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:51.395
And get your butt out of here
before Santa gets back.
Santa's here?

01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:53.630
Yeah.
Oh, no. Okay.

01:03:53.697 --> 01:03:56.133
Uh, about this...
You were never here.

01:04:00.104 --> 01:04:03.173
You have the bell.
I have the bell.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.909
Yes. Okay.

01:04:04.975 --> 01:04:06.576
Bye, Fitzy.

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:18.889
When we first met,
you told me you wanted
a shot at the big time.

01:04:18.956 --> 01:04:20.891
Well, I'd like to
give you that shot...

01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:24.728
A truly unique opportunity
to be great.

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:26.430
What do you say?

01:04:28.498 --> 01:04:30.334
Are you okay?

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.337
I... I don't know.

01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:36.240
[Chuckles]
Congratulations, Dax.

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:38.208
The job's yours
if you want it.

01:04:38.275 --> 01:04:40.344
Take tonight
to think it over.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:44.014
A decision this important
shouldn't be rushed, hmm?

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:47.351
I hope you say yes.

Good morning, Harvey!

Mr. Ardwick.
It's all yours.

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:14.378
I mean,
True National's.

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:16.880
Sorry I didn't clean up.
The place is a mess.

01:05:16.947 --> 01:05:18.983
Have a good day!

01:05:27.691 --> 01:05:29.693
Welcome to
the North Pole, Dax!

01:05:31.996 --> 01:05:34.531
- No jet lag.
- And no excess baggage fee.

01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:36.400
I like.

01:05:36.466 --> 01:05:40.304
- It's good to be here, sir.
- Oh, no, no.
"Sir" won't do at all.

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:44.208
If we're going to
be working together,
I insist you call me Santa.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:46.076
Whatever you say, Santa.

01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:48.445
And this must be Mrs. Claus.

01:05:48.512 --> 01:05:51.115
Santa, you're a lucky man.
I remind him of that
every day.

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:53.183
You know what they say?
"Behind every great man..."

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:54.918
- Is a great woman.
- What?

01:05:54.985 --> 01:05:58.222
-[Santa] Hmm?
- No, there's a plate of cookies.
Have one!

01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:00.024
I'd love to,
but I just ate.

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:02.326
Eat... the... cookie.

01:06:09.566 --> 01:06:13.770
That is the most amazing cookie
I have ever tasted!

01:06:13.837 --> 01:06:15.605
You're gonna
fit right in, Dax.

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:17.707
Welcoming committee!

01:06:25.949 --> 01:06:27.751
Welcome
to the North Pole.

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:30.087
Ho, ho.

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:39.029
Now, Dax, since Christmas
is just around the corner,

01:06:39.096 --> 01:06:41.465
It's best if we
swear you in right away.

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:44.034
Normally, this ceremony
is far more festive,

01:06:44.101 --> 01:06:46.303
But there's so much to do
and so little time.

01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:48.872
It's not about the hype,
it's about the work.
Well said.

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:51.241
Citizens of the North Pole,

01:06:51.308 --> 01:06:54.144
We are gathering here today
on this auspicious occasion...

01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:56.180
To enact a most noble...

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:59.616
Not... so... fast.

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:07.757
Well.
Don't mean to interrupt.

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:11.561
Actually, no,
I do mean to interrupt.

01:07:11.628 --> 01:07:14.598
- What do you want, Eleanor?
- I think we all know
exactly what I want.

01:07:14.664 --> 01:07:18.268
Yes, but I'm afraid
I've already made
that decision.

01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:21.538
Dax here has demonstrated
that he is perfectly capable...

01:07:21.605 --> 01:07:23.407
Of handling
the HOHOHO position.

01:07:23.473 --> 01:07:26.876
Oh! Well, good for him,
but... [Clears Throat]

"Rule Number 2701B:"

01:07:30.247 --> 01:07:32.982
Although Santa is responsible
for selecting the HOHOHO,

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:36.620
"Anyone who disagrees
with his decision may publicly
lodge an objection."

01:07:38.222 --> 01:07:40.624
- I object.

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:43.260
"Furthermore, they are also
within their rights..."

01:07:43.327 --> 01:07:45.762
To challenge the nominee
to a single competitive event...

01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:49.833
"In which the victor
shall be duly named HOHOHO."

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:51.968
Can she do this?

01:07:52.035 --> 01:07:54.638
Watch me.
I, Eleanor the elf,

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:57.207
Formally challenges
Santa's normie nominee...

01:07:57.274 --> 01:08:00.777

01:08:05.882 --> 01:08:07.917
SBC? What's that?

01:08:07.984 --> 01:08:10.354
Santa's Boot Camp.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.789
It's a brutal obstacle course
that Santa designed...

01:08:12.856 --> 01:08:15.325
To help prepare us
for all the challenges
that come our way.

01:08:15.392 --> 01:08:17.861
No problem then.
I run the Cro-Magnon
every year.

01:08:19.129 --> 01:08:21.631
Eleanor has never
been beat, ever.

01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:23.767
Her father runs the boot camp.
He has for 85 years.

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:28.071
Nobody knows that place
better than her.
I'm not giving up now.

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:29.939
Let's do this.

01:08:30.006 --> 01:08:33.577
It's settled then.
Fitz will guide you
through the course.

01:08:34.978 --> 01:08:36.712
- Good luck, Dax.
- I got this.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.615
What do I have to lose?

01:08:38.682 --> 01:08:40.184
Everything.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.621
[Bird Hooting]

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:48.892
Nervous?

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:52.196
No, but you should be.

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.264
That's what
the last guy said.

01:08:54.331 --> 01:08:56.233
What was his name again?

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:59.002
Oh, yeah. Pathetic loser.

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:01.638
Welcome, contestants!

01:09:01.705 --> 01:09:05.742
When this snowball
hits the ground,
begin the race.

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:11.448
The first elf, or person,
to complete the course wins.

01:09:11.515 --> 01:09:14.783
If one of you does not
complete the course,

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:20.224
Your remains
will be sent free of charge
to your loved ones.

01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:22.859
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

01:09:22.926 --> 01:09:24.894
There will be a small fee.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.497
[Wheezing Laugh]
I'm kidding again!

01:09:29.933 --> 01:09:31.401
[Laughing Continues]

01:09:47.817 --> 01:09:49.519
This is where
we're supposed to start.

After you.

01:09:54.824 --> 01:09:56.726

Really great.

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:47.010
[Clears Throat]

01:10:48.612 --> 01:10:50.847
Have you heard the story
of the tortoise and the hare?

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:53.149
Santa, that's a fable.
This is real life.

01:10:53.216 --> 01:10:55.285
She's got a point there,
my dear.

01:10:55.352 --> 01:10:58.488
Okay. I'm going
to start now!

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:04.461
Don't trip.

01:11:06.363 --> 01:11:08.197
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:11.167
Excuse me.

01:11:11.234 --> 01:11:13.337
- Oh.
- [Dax Grunting]

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:16.373
Oops.
[Chuckling]

01:11:20.043 --> 01:11:21.511
Is that legal?

01:11:21.578 --> 01:11:23.747
I don't think she cares.

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:43.900
Wait for me!
[Screaming]

01:11:51.941 --> 01:11:53.410
Come here!

01:11:53.477 --> 01:11:55.044
Get off me!
Get off!

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:02.552
[Grunting]

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:09.058
Get off me!

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:14.130
- [Groaning]
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Oh!

01:12:14.197 --> 01:12:16.933
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.903
- I may start slow,
but I finish strong.
- Ow!

01:12:21.237 --> 01:12:22.806
That's what
I'm talking about!

01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:26.510
Yes! That's how Mama
butters her cookies!

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.717
I mean...
"Go, Dax, go."

01:12:33.783 --> 01:12:37.220
[All Chanting]
Go, Dax, go. Go, Dax, go.

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:39.989
Go, Dax, go!
Go, Dax, go!

01:12:47.464 --> 01:12:49.766
I could have been
the HOHOHO.

01:12:49.833 --> 01:12:51.801
But did they ask me?
No, no, no.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:54.971
[Laughing]
See, that's funny.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:03.112
[Shouts]
Who's the man?

01:13:03.179 --> 01:13:04.714
[All]
Dax the man!

01:13:04.781 --> 01:13:07.451
- I said, who's the man?
- Dax the man!

01:13:07.517 --> 01:13:09.118
[Ferocious Shouting]

01:13:12.288 --> 01:13:14.591
[Squealing,
Chuckling]

01:13:24.601 --> 01:13:26.436
- [Gasping]
- [Groaning]

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:28.705
Oh, sugarplums!

01:13:28.772 --> 01:13:30.974
Ooh.
[Dax Groaning]

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.609
Excuse me.

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:39.182
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

01:13:45.455 --> 01:13:47.356
[Eleanor]
Whoo!

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:49.158
[Eleanor Laughing]

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:02.539
Is this all you got,
normie?

01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:08.945
How's it feel to be losing
to a girl, huh?

01:14:11.481 --> 01:14:13.550
Hey, heads up.

01:14:15.485 --> 01:14:18.555
[All Groaning]

01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:23.660
Aw. Good-bye.

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.366
Good effort there.

01:14:30.433 --> 01:14:33.703
Whoo! Yeah!
[Laughing]

01:14:35.839 --> 01:14:39.042
[All]
Oh, no!
Tough break, normie!

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:58.828
Hmm.
[Chuckling]

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:15.311
- [Bell Rings]
- Well, that was fun
and easier than expected.

01:15:15.378 --> 01:15:17.981
And since time
is of the essence,

01:15:18.047 --> 01:15:21.951
I would like to be sworn in
and retrieve my father's bell,

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:23.352
If you please.

01:15:23.419 --> 01:15:26.055
Billie, I'd like you
to hold on to the bell
for now.

01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:28.091
But, Santa, that's mine.

01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:31.728
I think it best
if you call me "sir."

01:15:35.098 --> 01:15:37.767
You okay, son?
I'm sorry, Santa.
I let you down.

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:40.036
Oh, quite the contrary.

01:15:40.103 --> 01:15:43.206
You demonstrated
all the virtues
I hold most dear.

01:15:43.272 --> 01:15:45.609
The most important thing
is never to lose sight...

01:15:45.675 --> 01:15:48.411
Of who you are
and who you can be.

01:15:48.477 --> 01:15:50.647
There's a great man
within you, Dax.

01:15:50.714 --> 01:15:52.616
Don't be afraid
to let him shine.

01:15:52.682 --> 01:15:54.651
[Dax]
Thank you.

01:15:54.718 --> 01:15:57.520
[Mrs. Claus]
Who's hungry?

01:15:57.587 --> 01:15:59.288
Let's get
something to eat.

01:15:59.355 --> 01:16:01.290
I'll be there
in a minute.

01:16:01.357 --> 01:16:05.929
Aw. That was a cute
little moment, wasn't it?

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:08.865
Congratulations, Eleanor.
You got what you wanted.

01:16:10.533 --> 01:16:12.301
Some people
just never learn.

01:16:12.368 --> 01:16:14.337
Give it a rest.

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:17.540
Just be nicer to Billie.
She's a great person and doesn't
deserve the way you treat her.

01:16:17.607 --> 01:16:21.277
Oh.
You've fallen for her.

01:16:21.344 --> 01:16:25.214
How pathetic.
Face it, normie,
you don't belong here.

01:16:25.281 --> 01:16:28.051
This isn't your world.

01:16:28.117 --> 01:16:29.653
Go home.

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:46.002
There you are.
I'm sorry, Billie.

01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:47.737
I let everybody down,
especially you.

01:16:47.804 --> 01:16:49.572
If anything,
I let you down.

01:16:49.639 --> 01:16:51.875
I should have known
Eleanor was up to something.
I could have prepared you.

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:54.110
Doesn't matter.
What's done is done.

01:16:54.177 --> 01:16:56.612
I guess the question is,
what now?

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:58.648
Well, it's gonna get
really busy around here.

01:16:58.715 --> 01:17:00.316
I'm sure we can find you
another job.

01:17:00.383 --> 01:17:02.719
I appreciate that,

01:17:02.786 --> 01:17:06.122
But I think
I'm gonna go back,
find my own path,

01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:08.091
Get reacquainted
with the real Dax.

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:10.994
Well...

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:13.362
Do you know what
you're gonna do?

01:17:13.429 --> 01:17:16.132
I'm still working
that one out.

01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:21.404
Well...

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.740
I'm sure
whatever you decide...

01:17:23.807 --> 01:17:25.875
Will be great.

01:17:33.717 --> 01:17:36.252
See you in the morning?
Yeah. See you then.

01:17:52.335 --> 01:17:53.970
[Bell Rings]

01:17:57.473 --> 01:17:59.709
Time to go to work.

01:18:02.779 --> 01:18:05.749
I mean, I can't really
walk the whole way there.

01:18:05.815 --> 01:18:08.417
[Ringing]

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.421
Oh, mama.

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:21.364
[Tires Screeching]

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:23.199
[Warning Bell Dinging]

01:18:23.266 --> 01:18:25.101
Can't drive stick.

01:18:32.075 --> 01:18:34.844
Okay. All right.
Let's go.

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:40.249
Come on. Come on, baby.
Come on.

01:18:40.316 --> 01:18:41.851
Yes!

01:18:41.918 --> 01:18:43.519
Did he say anything
before he left?

01:18:43.586 --> 01:18:45.889
Just that he had urgent
business to attend to.
Am I in trouble?

01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:48.825
Don't worry yourself.
But set the portal for
the same location, please.

01:18:48.892 --> 01:18:50.526
Right away.
I just don't get it.

01:18:50.593 --> 01:18:52.896
He was making
so much progress.
I thought he had changed.

01:18:52.962 --> 01:18:54.764
That's what's
so confusing about this.

01:18:54.831 --> 01:18:57.100
But people can be
very unpredictable, Billie.

01:18:57.166 --> 01:18:59.969
You never know
what they'll do next.

01:19:00.036 --> 01:19:01.370
Fitz.

01:19:05.141 --> 01:19:08.077
Gentlemen, let's do this.
[Crowd Shouting]

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:23.659
- Lane!
- Whoa, whoa. Easy, Dax!
You just take it easy.

01:19:23.726 --> 01:19:27.730
You lay one finger on me,
and I'm gonna sue you so fast,
it's gonna make your head spin.

01:19:27.797 --> 01:19:29.532
Relax.
I'm not here to hurt you.

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:32.635
I'm here to stop you
from destroying a bunch
of kids' hopes and dreams.

01:19:32.701 --> 01:19:35.738
Well, unless you can pull some
kind of miracle out of your hat,

01:19:35.805 --> 01:19:37.540
I'd say this center
is out of time.

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:40.376
[Chuckles]
Look at that. You're
not even wearing a hat.

01:19:40.443 --> 01:19:42.278
No, but I do have this.

01:19:43.412 --> 01:19:47.283
Oh. Well, geez,
that changes everything.

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:50.353
I get to knock down
a building, and you get
to ring a little bell.

01:19:50.419 --> 01:19:53.122
Oh.
[Chuckling]

01:19:57.193 --> 01:20:00.729
What's going on?
Hi. Remember me?

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:03.166
You know, the kid
with the pathetic DNA.

01:20:05.101 --> 01:20:07.837
Ardwick? Is that you?

01:20:07.904 --> 01:20:10.039
I gotta give you credit...
You were almost right.

01:20:10.106 --> 01:20:14.310
I almost amounted to nothing
because I made the mistake
of listening to you.

01:20:14.377 --> 01:20:17.346
This guy's been
stealing from the center
since I was a kid.

01:20:17.413 --> 01:20:20.516
He just emptied their
entire endowment and fled
to the Canary Islands.

01:20:20.583 --> 01:20:22.852
It's true.
He stole everything!

01:20:27.857 --> 01:20:30.259
Life is full
of disappointments.

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:31.727
Get used to it.

01:20:31.794 --> 01:20:33.462
[Man]
Shame on you!

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:38.902
Make sure you transfer
all that money
back to the center.

01:20:40.203 --> 01:20:42.738
[Applauding]
Nice little trick, Dax.

01:20:42.805 --> 01:20:45.909
But tricks don't pay the rent.
That money was due today.

01:20:45.975 --> 01:20:48.177
So, no money, no building.

01:20:48.244 --> 01:20:51.480
Oh, you need the money now?
Watch this.

01:20:55.718 --> 01:20:58.054
[Laughing]

01:20:58.121 --> 01:21:00.756
Maybe you should
get Santa there
to help you out.

01:21:00.823 --> 01:21:04.360
Why don't you head back
to whatever mall
you crawled out of, huh?

01:21:04.427 --> 01:21:05.628
Take it down!

01:21:09.899 --> 01:21:11.500
I'm afraid you're
on your own, son.

01:21:15.004 --> 01:21:16.505
Stop! Now!

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:20.076
Stop right now!
Stop!

01:21:26.482 --> 01:21:29.118
Oh!

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:34.523
[Engine Stops]

01:21:36.292 --> 01:21:38.327
How many of you believe
in Santa Claus?

01:21:43.599 --> 01:21:45.234
I didn't.

01:21:45.301 --> 01:21:50.273
In fact, I didn't
believe in anything good
for the longest time.

01:21:50.339 --> 01:21:52.041
But I'll never make
that mistake again.

01:21:52.108 --> 01:21:56.412
Are we going to let
one man's greed destroy
something that we all...

01:21:56.479 --> 01:21:59.415
People! People, please.
Don't listen to him.

01:21:59.482 --> 01:22:01.951
The man's afraid
of progress.
Progress?

01:22:02.018 --> 01:22:05.188
Tearing this down
is not progress.

01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:09.625
Progress is
believing in our kids,

01:22:09.692 --> 01:22:13.396
Giving them a chance,
helping them find their passion.

01:22:15.298 --> 01:22:19.202
If you believe,
stand with me.

01:22:19.268 --> 01:22:22.972
Stand with me
right here right now!

01:22:30.213 --> 01:22:34.083
Together, we can save
this youth center.

01:22:34.150 --> 01:22:36.152
Don't do this,
or I will destroy you.

01:22:38.621 --> 01:22:40.489
Knock down this building,

01:22:40.556 --> 01:22:44.727
And your creative accounting
will become public knowledge.

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:47.730
Christmas wouldn't be too fun
behind bars, now, would it?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.236
This isn't over, Dax.

01:23:01.077 --> 01:23:05.014
The center is ours
and will always be ours!

01:23:05.081 --> 01:23:08.284
[Cheering]

01:23:13.589 --> 01:23:15.458
Way to go, Dax!

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:36.345
Oops.
[Chuckling]

01:23:38.214 --> 01:23:40.616
What just...
How did you...

01:23:40.683 --> 01:23:43.686
Let's just say,
it's never too late to believe
in Christmas miracles.

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:47.356
That has gotta be the weirdest,
coolest thing I've ever seen.

01:23:47.423 --> 01:23:50.426
Life is full of surprises, kid.
Get used to it.

01:23:50.493 --> 01:23:52.695
- I always knew
you were a good guy.
- Really?

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:53.796
No.

01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:00.369
Don't you have
a Christmas play
to prepare for?

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:04.940
Thank you.
Let's go
put on a play!

01:24:05.007 --> 01:24:06.609
[Cheering]
Let's go!

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:16.819
There you are.

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:20.323
In case you forgot,
I still need to be sworn in,
and there's so much...

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:22.391
Let me stop you
right there, Eleanor.

01:24:23.492 --> 01:24:24.627
Sir?

01:24:24.693 --> 01:24:27.430
We all know what a stickler
you are for the rules,

01:24:27.496 --> 01:24:31.900
So I wanted you to be aware
of sub-rule 11A, section 411:

01:24:31.967 --> 01:24:37.106
"In the unlikely event
of a challenge for the position
of HOHOHO,"

01:24:37.173 --> 01:24:39.975
Good sportsmanship
must be exhibited...

01:24:40.042 --> 01:24:43.112
"By each competitor
at all times."

01:24:43.179 --> 01:24:45.448
In laymen terms,
you lose, sucker!

01:24:45.514 --> 01:24:48.317
Come on!
It was a competition!
I was a good sportsman.

01:24:48.384 --> 01:24:50.286
I won fair and square.

01:24:50.353 --> 01:24:52.921
I'm Santa, the one who knows
if you've been bad or good,

01:24:52.988 --> 01:24:56.058
And you have
disqualified yourself
many times over.

01:24:56.125 --> 01:24:58.261
Ouch.
That's gotta sting.

01:24:58.327 --> 01:25:00.363
But I'm the only one
that qualifies.

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:02.231
Wrong again,
my grumpy friend.

01:25:02.298 --> 01:25:05.168
I believe that
there is one person...

01:25:05.234 --> 01:25:09.738
Who has clearly demonstrated
all of the five
sugarplum virtues...

01:25:09.805 --> 01:25:12.175
And then some.

01:25:12.241 --> 01:25:16.044
You see this?
I'm doing this
because I mean you.

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:18.046
Me?
Her?

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:20.816
Why do I get the feeling
that this might have been
your plan all along?

01:25:20.883 --> 01:25:23.886
I have no idea what
you're talking about.
[Angry Grunt]

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:30.493
I've dreamed of
being the HOHOHO.

01:25:30.559 --> 01:25:33.196
I know.
I don't know what to say.

01:25:33.262 --> 01:25:36.965
- Say you'll accept the job.
- Yeah. Yes.

01:25:37.032 --> 01:25:38.901
Yes! Yes! Yes!
[Laughing]

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:45.574
Oh, my God!
So everything
worked out for the best.

01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:49.245
- I guess you could say that.
- Then perhaps I could get
an early Christmas present?

01:25:49.312 --> 01:25:51.614
Oh, you already
have it, Dax.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:54.149
The most important
present of all...

01:25:54.217 --> 01:25:56.319
The best version
of yourself.

01:25:56.385 --> 01:25:59.255
How about the best version
of myself...

01:25:59.322 --> 01:26:02.191
In my new car?

01:26:03.559 --> 01:26:06.262
[Grunts, Clicks Tongue]
Worth a shot.

01:26:09.898 --> 01:26:12.401
Billie.

01:26:12.468 --> 01:26:16.004
You still mad at me
for the whole bell thing?

01:26:16.071 --> 01:26:20.142
How can I be?
You wanted to do
something great, and you did.

01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:21.910
For all those people.

01:26:30.185 --> 01:26:32.255
What was that for?

01:26:32.321 --> 01:26:34.257
Do I need a reason?

01:26:34.323 --> 01:26:36.259
No reason needed.

01:26:36.325 --> 01:26:39.962
You think this can work?
A normie and an elf?

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:44.300
I like to think
this world is full
of wonderful possibilities.

01:26:53.276 --> 01:26:55.043
[Squeals, Laughing]

01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:57.413
Merry Christmas to me.

01:27:03.085 --> 01:27:06.355
[Laughing]

01:27:11.627 --> 01:27:14.062
* Deck the halls
with boughs of holly *

01:27:14.129 --> 01:27:16.399
* Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la *

01:27:16.465 --> 01:27:18.834
* 'Tis the season
to be jolly *

01:27:18.901 --> 01:27:21.370
* Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la *

01:27:21.437 --> 01:27:23.739
* Don we now our gay apparel *

01:27:23.806 --> 01:27:26.342
* Fa-la-la, la-la-la,
la-la-la *

01:27:26.409 --> 01:27:28.711
* Troll the ancient
yuletide carol *

01:27:28.777 --> 01:27:31.347
* Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la *

01:27:31.414 --> 01:27:33.682
* Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la *

01:27:33.749 --> 01:27:36.285
* See the blazing yule
before us *

01:27:36.352 --> 01:27:38.654
* Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la *

01:27:38.721 --> 01:27:41.256
* Strike the harp
and join the chorus *

01:27:41.324 --> 01:27:43.492
* Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la *

01:27:43.559 --> 01:27:46.194
* Follow me in merry measure *

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:48.597
* Fa-la-la, la-la-la,
la-la-la *

01:27:48.664 --> 01:27:51.199
* While I tell
of yuletide treasures *

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:53.536
* Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la *

01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:56.472
* Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la *

01:28:18.394 --> 01:28:20.863
* Fast away
the old year passes *

01:28:20.929 --> 01:28:23.332
* Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la *

01:28:23.399 --> 01:28:25.701
* Hail the new,
ye lads and lasses *

01:28:25.768 --> 01:28:28.203
* Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la *

01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:30.506
* Sing we joyous all together *

01:28:30.573 --> 01:28:33.008
* Fa-la-la, la-la-la,
la-la-la *

01:28:33.075 --> 01:28:35.578
* Heedless of the wind
and weather *

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:37.980
* Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la *

01:28:38.046 --> 01:28:41.316
* Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la **
