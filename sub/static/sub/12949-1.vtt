WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS WHO DEFEND
THEM.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
THIS IS ONE OF THEIR STORIES.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
JUST FINISHED UP WITH THE
CLERK.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
HE'S SHOOK UP BUT OKAY.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
SAID THE GUY JUST FLIPPED OUT,
STARTED DANCING LIKE

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
MICHAEL JACKSON, THEN SHOWED A
GUN AND ROBBED THE PLACE.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
PERP WAS A BLACK MALE, AROUND
19, REALLY SEXY --

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
SEXY?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
EXACTLY HOW SEXY?

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
DIMPLES, "HONEY BROWN"
COMPLEXION, CHISELED ABS, EXTRA

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
SHINY CHAP-STICKED LIPS...

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
DAMN, THAT IS SEXY.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
THERE'S ONLY ONE 19-YEAR-OLD
BLACK MALE THAT MATCHES THAT

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
SEXY PROFILE.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
PRETTY BOY FLIZZY.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
UM, ONLY THE HOTTEST
UP-AND-COMING R&B STAR!

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
YOU'VE HEARD OF HIS SONGS --
"TITTY TELETHON"?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
"PLEASURE ME ORALLY"?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
"DON'T TOUCH MY ANUS, GIRL"?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
HOW WOULD I HAVE HEARD THIS?

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
OKAY, I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD,
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH!"

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
ALL DAY LONG ON THE RADIO,
THAT'S ALL I HEAR, EVEN ON THE

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
WHITE STATIONS.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
NO, I HAVEN'T HEARD
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH!"

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
EH, IT'S NOT MY THING, BUT
IT'S WHAT PASSES FOR R&B NOW,

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
ALL RIGHT?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
WHAT CAN I SAY?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I GOT TEENAGE DAUGHTERS.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
THEY'RE INTO BLACK GUYS, SO THIS
IS WHAT I GOT TO HEAR.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GOOD OLD
DAYS WHEN BLACK SINGERS WOULD

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
DRESS IN HIGH-HEEL BOOTS OR BURN
HOOKERS WITH CRACK PIPES?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
YOU'RE SHOWING YOUR AGE, MY
FRIEND.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
FLIZZY'S IN TOWN, DOING A SHOW
AT WOODCREST POST PAVILION

01:13.000 --> 01:13.000
TONIGHT.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I WAS HOPING TO GO.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
NOW I HAVE AN EXCUSE.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
BUILDER REFUSED

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
INSPIRATION THAT MADE LADY SING

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
COME

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
TILL THE WAR IS WON

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
GRANDDAD, WHAT WE GOT TO EAT?!

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Granddad: RENT!

01:59.000 --> 01:59.000
Riley: I'M HUNGRY!

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Granddad: THEN HAVE SLEEP FOR
DINNER!

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
YOU CAN EAT TOMORROW.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
YOU'RE GETTING FAT ANYWAY!

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
THE SECURITY-CAMERA FOOTAGE
YOU'RE WATCHING IS ALLEGEDLY OF

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
R&B SUPERSTAR PRETTY BOY FLIZZY
HOLDING UP A LIQUOR STORE IN

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
WOODCREST.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO
CLEARLY SEE THE SUSPECT'S FACE,

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
AUTHORITIES SAY HIS SEXINESS IS
AN EXACT MATCH.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
THIS ISN'T FLIZZY'S FIRST
RUN-IN WITH THE LAW.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
LAST YEAR, HE RECEIVED FOUR
MONTHS PROBATION AFTER BEATING

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
HIS THEN-GIRLFRIEND CHRISTIANNA
LIVE ONSTAGE DURING THE GRAMMYS.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
I'D JUST LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO
ALL MY FANS FOR BEATING MY HOT

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
R&B GIRLFRIEND.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
I LET MY FANS DOWN.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
WITHOUT YOU, I WOULDN'T EVEN
HAVE AN R&B GIRLFRIEND TO BEAT.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
A YEAR BEFORE THAT, FLIZZY
RECEIVED A TWO-YEAR SUSPENDED

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
SENTENCE FOR SMUGGLING AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS FROM NICARAGUAN REBELS.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
I'D JUST LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO
ALL MY FANS FOR SMUGGLING

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FROM
SOUTH AMERICAN DEATH SQUADS.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
I MAKE NO EXCUSES, OTHER THAN IT
WAS A REALLY GOOD DEAL AND THEY

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
WERE THROWING IN A LOT OF FREE
AMMUNITION.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
SIX MONTHS AGO, FLIZZY WAS
ARRESTED FOR FIGHTING IN THE

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
V.I.P. SECTION OF A NIGHTCLUB
WITH NICKI MINAJ.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
I'D JUST LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO
ALL MY FANS, FOR FIGHTING IN THE

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
V.I.P. SECTION WITH NICKI MINAJ.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
IN MY DEFENSE, I THOUGHT SHE WAS
A ROBOT SENT FROM THE FUTURE TO

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
KILL ME.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
WOODCREST TEA PARTY CHAIRMAN
UNCLE RUCKUS STAGED A SMALL

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
PROTEST AT THE VENUE TODAY.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Ruckus: WHO KEEPS GIVING
THESE HIGH-YELLOW FELONS RECORD

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
CONTRACTS?!

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
OH, OH, IT'S JUST A RECORD YOU
SAY!

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
WELL, WHITE FOLKS, YOU WON'T BE
SAYING THAT WHEN THE NIGGA THAT

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
SINGS ON THAT RECORD COMES TO
TOWN AND IMPREGNATES ALL THE

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
WHITE WOMEN OF CHILD-REARING
AGE!

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE
PLANS TO DO!

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
JUST THINK OF ALL THE GOVERNMENT
MONEY AND FOOD STAMPS THAT THEM

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
LITTLE MIXED-RACE QUADROON NIGGA
CHILDREN WILL BE CONSUMING!

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
AND THEY CONSUME A WHOLE LOT
MORE THAN REGULAR CHILDREN

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
'CAUSE THEY EATIN' FOR TWO
RACES!

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
OTHERS FELT DIFFERENTLY.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE
SAYS.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
FLIZZY CAN WHUP MY ASS ANYTIME!

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
COME ON! BEAT IT UP, FLEEZY!

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
WHOO!

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Sarah: I WANT YOU TO GET MAD
AT ME, ONCE IN AWHILE, YOU KNOW?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Tom: IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND...

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Granddad: TURN THAT DOWN.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
NOW LISTEN, LISTEN. Shh!

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Sarah: I'M TIRED OF IT!

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
IT'S BORING!

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
IT'S BORING ME TO DEATH!

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Tom: SARAH, PLEASE CALM DOWN!

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
I SAID I APOLOGIZE!

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Sarah: THERE YOU GO AGAIN.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN!

04:13.000 --> 04:13.000
Tom: DOING WHAT?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Sarah: APOLOGIZING!

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Tom: YOU DON'T WANT ME TO
APOLOGIZE?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Sarah: NO, I DON'T!

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Tom: OKAY, I'M SORRY I'M
APOLOGIZING.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Sarah: YOU DID IT AGAIN!

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Tom: SARAH, CALM DOWN!

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
I'M SORRY.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I'M SORRY!

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I CAN'T STOP!

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Sarah: OH, I SWEAR TO GOD,
TOM, IF YOU APOLOGIZE AGAIN, YOU

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
ARE OUT OF HERE!

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Tom: I'M --
MM.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
OKAY.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
THEN JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Sarah: THAT'S THE PROBLEM,
TOM!

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT
TO DO!

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
I WANT YOU TO DO WHAT I WANT YOU
TO DO BUT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
DO IT!

04:41.000 --> 04:41.000
Tom: WHAT?!

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
BUT WHY NOT JUST TELL ME?!

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Sarah: BECAUSE!

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
NO WOMAN WAKES UP AND SAYS,
"GEE, I HOPE MY MAN DOES

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
EVERYTHING I TELL HIM TO TODAY."

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
YOU'RE THE MAN, TOM!

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
SOMETIMES I WANT YOU TO
DOMINATE!

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
TAKE CONTROL!

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
IF I'M OUT OF LINE, PUT ME IN
CHECK!

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Tom: SURE, HONEY.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Sarah: OHH! TOM!

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Tom: FINE!

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
I HEAR YOU!

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
FROM NOW ON, I'LL TAKE CONTROL,
AND I WON'T APOLOGIZE ANYMORE.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
EXCEPT, WAIT.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
YOU WANTED ME TO STOP
APOLOGIZING, SO I'M SUPPOSED TO

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
DO THE OPPOSITE OF THAT.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
RIGHT?

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
YEAH, SO THEN I GUESS I  WILL
APOLOGIZE, THEN...

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
SORRY?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
GET OUT.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Tom: NOW, HONEY, DON'T DO --
Sarah: GET OUT!

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Tom: OW!

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Riley: AW, MAN, HERE HE COME!

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Granddad: RILEY, HIT THE
LIGHTS!

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Riley: MM-HMM.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Granddad: HUEY, ELECTRONICS!

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I'M TIRED OF THAT HENPECKED
SIMP COMING OVER HERE EVERY TIME

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
SHE THROWS HIM OUT, SCREAMING
LIKE A LITTLE BITCH.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
THIS TIME, HE CAN SLEEP IN THE
YARD.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO
CLEARLY SEE THE SUSPECT'S FACE,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
AUTHORITIES HA--

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Tom: PLEASE.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Huey: IT'S TOILET PAPER AND

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
A POP-TART.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
HEY, DON'T TELL MY GRANDDAD
ABOUT THIS.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
WE NOT SUPPOSED TO FEED YOU.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Tom: I REALLY DON'T THINK
IT'S PRUDENT TO RECORD AN

06:24.000 --> 06:24.000
ATTORNEY MEETING.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
I'M NOT RECORDING.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
THIS IS A LIVE STREAM.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
WHAT'S UP?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Y'ALL KNOW WHO IT IS --
PRETTY BEEZY FLEE-YEEZEY-WEEZY,

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
YOU KNOW?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
I APPRECIATE ALL THE LOVE AND
SUPPORT Y'ALL BEEN SENDING ME

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
SINCE THE WHOLE INCIDENT WENT
DOWN.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
NEVER FEAR.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
GOT BIG LAWYERS ON THE CASE.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
SAY WHAT'S UP TO TOM DuBOIS.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Tom: FLIZZY, I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO TURN IT OFF, NOW.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
KILL THE CAMERA, B.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Tom: I ALSO THINK THESE
PEOPLE SHOULD LEAVE.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
"THESE PEOPLE?"
YOU MEAN "THESE PEOPLE?"

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Tom: I MEAN THESE PEOPLE.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
YOU MEAN  MY  PEOPLE, NIGGA!

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
THESE  MY  PEOPLE.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
ANYTHING YOU CAN SAY TO ME YOU
CAN SAY IN FRONT OF THEM.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
IF ANYTHING, NIGGA, YOU THE
STRANGER HERE.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
YOU SHOULD LEAVE THE ROOM.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Tom: IT'S MY OFFICE.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
OKAY, THEN, SO WHAT'S THE BIG
SECRET THAT YOU CAN'T

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
TELL ME IN FRONT OF MY FANS AND
MY PEOPLE?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
MATTER OF FACT, WHY AM I EVEN
HERE?

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Tom: YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT YOUR CRIMINAL CASE.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
OH, THAT'S RIGHT!

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Tom: I REVIEWED THE CASE, AND
I'VE WATCHED THE SECURITY

07:12.000 --> 07:12.000
FOOTAGE.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
COOL. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
CAN YOU GET ME OFF?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Tom: DID YOU ROB THE LIQUOR
STORE, FLIZZY?

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
I CAN'T SAY THAT...I DID IT,
BUT, HONESTLY, REALLY CAN'T SAY

07:22.000 --> 07:22.000
F'SHO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Tom: AND WHY CAN'T YOU SAY
"F'SHO"?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
UP!

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Tom: AND HOW ABOUT THESE --
HOW ABOUT YOUR ENTOURAGE?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
DO THEY KNOW ANYTHING?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
UP, TOO!

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
HEY, MAN, WHEN WE GO OUT, WE GO
HARD.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
COMPLICATED IT IS BEING ME.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
ALL THE TIME I
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I SAID.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Tom: HOW?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
'CAUSE I GOT LIKE 18 PEOPLE
TWEETING FOR ME AT ONE TIME.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
UP!

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
SO, LIKE, I LOOK AT THE TAPE AND
I SAY, "IS IT ME, OR IS IT

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
SOMEONE I JUST PAID TO ROB A
LIQUOR STORE WHO LOOKS JUST LIKE

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
ME?"
I DON'T KNOW.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Tom: OKAY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
UP FRONT THAT I HAVE SERIOUS

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
ISSUES WITH SOME OF YOUR
BEHAVIOR IN THE PAST, ESPECIALLY

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
HITTING A WOMAN.

07:57.000 --> 07:57.000
B-BUT WAIT.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
I KNEW YOU WAS GONNA SAY THAT.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
CAN I TELL YOU MY SIDE OF IT,
THOUGH?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Tom: NO, I DON'T --
CAN I TELL YOU MY SIDE OF IT,

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
THOUGH?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Tom: NO, FLIZZY, THERE'S --
CAN I TELL YOU MY SIDE OF IT

08:05.000 --> 08:05.000
THOUGH?!

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Tom: FINE! WHAT?!

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
UP!

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
SOON AS I GOT ARRESTED, I SAID,
"I WANT THE DUDE THAT GOT

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
R. KELLY OFF."

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Tom: WELL, I PROSECUTED
R. KELLY, AND I --

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
NEVER MIND.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Tom: MY ANSWER IS ALMOST
CERTAINLY NO, BUT...I'LL THINK

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
ABOUT IT.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
IF I DO TAKE THE CASE, MY
RETAINER IS --

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
MY RETAINER IS...

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
ENTERTAIN THAT.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Tom: PLEASE STOP THROWING
MONEY AT ME.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
THINGS A BITCH WILL NEVER
SAY.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
HEY, THAT'S A SONG!

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
A'IGHT, PIMPIN', I'M-A SEE
YOU TOMORROW.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Tom: THAT SINGER
PRETTY BOY FLIZZY CAME IN TODAY.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Sarah: PRETTY BOY FLIZZY?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
HE'S HIRING YOU TO DEFEND HIM
FOR THE LIQUOR-STORE THING?

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
TOM, THAT'S HUGE!

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Tom: DON'T GET TOO EXCITED.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
I'M NOT TAKING THE CASE.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Sarah: WHY NOT?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Tom: I DON'T WANT TO DEFEND A
WOMAN-BEATER, FOR ONE.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Sarah: HE MADE A LITTLE TINY
MISTAKE.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Tom: I GUESS HITTING A WOMAN
IS OKAY IF YOU HAVE ABS,

09:04.000 --> 09:04.000
IS THAT IT?

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Sarah: HE'S A TALENTED
ARTIST.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Tom: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, OKAY.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
SLOW DOWN.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
"FLUID SWAP"?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
"RUB AGAINST MY ERECTION"?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH"?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I LOVE
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH!"

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
OH, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET
HIM TO SING AT JAZMINE'S

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
BIRTHDAY?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Tom: NO! DO YOU LET HER
LISTEN TO THAT?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Sarah: OUR PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN
ROUGH ON HER.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
IT WOULD BE NICE TO, YOU KNOW...

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
WHAT?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Tom: DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Sarah: WHAT?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Tom: THIS ISN'T ABOUT
JAZMINE.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
YOU  WANT TO MEET
PRETTY BOY FLIZZY.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
NO,  JAZMINE
WANTS TO MEET PRETTY BOY FLIZZY.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Tom: NO, YOU WANT ME TO
DEFEND PRETTY BOY FLIZZY BECAUSE

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
YOU WANT TO MEET HIM AND  DO  HIM!

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Sarah: WHAT?!

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Tom: YEAH! YEAH! YOU DO!

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
YOU WANT TO GO UNH ON HIM!

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
YOU WANT TO UNH ON HIM ALL
NIGHT!

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Sarah: I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW
INSECURE YOU ARE!

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Tom: HE'S LIKE YOUR PERFECT
MAN!

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
HE WON'T EVEN SAY SORRY WHEN HE
POUNDS YOUR FACE IN!

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Granddad: WAIT.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
WAIT.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
HE'S NOT COMING THIS WAY.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
HE'S GETTING IN HIS CAR.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Tom: YOU'RE A SELFISH
BASTARD, ROBERT FREEMAN!

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Tom: I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S
GONNA WORK OUT, FLIZZY.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
WHY NOT?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Tom: WELL, IT'S NOT YOU.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
IT'S ME.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
I'M JUST DEALING WITH SOME
PERSONAL PROBLEMS.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
UP, MY
DUDE!

10:31.000 --> 10:31.000
COME ON, TOM!

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE BOTH LETTING
THE HATERS GET US DOWN.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
WE GOT TO SHAKE THE HATERS.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
DO THIS FOR ME, TOM.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
COME ON. SHAKE THOSE HATERS.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
I'M HATE-FREE, BUT I CAN STILL
FEEL THE HATE ON YOU.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
MMM. FEELS GOOD, DOESN'T IT?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
OKAY, SO...

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
NOW WILL YOU TAKE THE CASE?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Tom: NO.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
OKAY, FINE.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
IF YOU CAN'T TAKE THE CASE, YOU
CAN'T TAKE THE CASE.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE ME -- SEXY,
BUFF ALPHA MALE -- AND YOU --

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
KINDHEARTED BUT FRUMPY
EVERYMAN -- COULD SOMEHOW BE

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
ABLE TO HELP EACH OTHER.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Tom: AM I A FRUMPY EVERYMAN?

11:01.000 --> 11:01.000
IS THAT IT?!

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
IS THAT WHY SHE'S LOST
INTEREST?!

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
OF COURSE.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
TOM!

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
YOUR HAIR LOOKS LIKE

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
YOU GOT NO FLASH, NO SWAG, NO
THIN VENEER OF TOUGHNESS.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
OF COURSE YOUR WIFE LEFT YOU AND
IS DOING IT TO SOME RANDOM GUY.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Tom: THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID
HAPPENED.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
SO, LOOK -- YOU TAKE THE
CASE, AND I TEACH YOU HOW TO

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
DRESS AND HOW TO TALK TO BITCHES
AND SAVE YOUR MARRIAGE.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Tom: YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
WHY NOT?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TEACH ME HOW TO
DANCE, RIGHT?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
NO.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
NO DANCING.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
BUT THERE WILL BE A SHOPPING
MONTAGE.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
TWO THINGS WOMEN HATE -- BROKE
MEN AND BORING MEN.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
GOOD NEWS IS, YOU'RE NOT BROKE.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
BUT YOU ARE BORING, AND WOMEN
HATE TO BE BORED, TOM.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
THEY HATE TO BE BORED.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
A WOMAN WOULD RATHER BE WITH A
GUY THAT BEATS THEM TO DEATH

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
THAN BORES THEM TO DEATH.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
TRUST ME, NIGGA, I KNOW.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
BUT WHY DO THEY WANT ME, TOM?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
IS IT MY INCREDIBLE SEXINESS?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
SURE.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
BUT WHY AM I SO SEXY?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
WHAT IS THE SECRET TO MY
SEXINESS?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
MY MONEY, MY JEWELS, FAME?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
ABSOLUTELY.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
BUT, REALLY, IT'S BECAUSE I'M A
UP.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
I GET ARRESTED, I DO DRUGS, I
ROB LIQUOR STORES -- ALLEGEDLY!

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
THAT'S WHAT ALL WOMEN WANT.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Tom: WHY?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
BECAUSE WOMEN HAVE NO
SELF-RESPECT!

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Tom: WELL, MY WIFE HAS

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
SELF-RESPECT.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
REALLY? YOU SURE?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Tom: YES!

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
SHE'S AN EDUCATED, WELL-ROUNDED,
CONFIDENT WOMAN.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I MAY NEED TO MEET HER.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Tom: NO, NO, NO. NO.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I KNOW WHERE THIS GOES.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO MY WIFE.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
DO YOUR WIFE?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
TOM, I WOULDN'T DO YOUR WIFE.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Tom: YOU HAVE A SONG CALLED
"I WILL DO YOUR WIFE!"

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I DIDN'T MEAN  YOUR  WIFE!

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I MEANT THAT METAPHORICALLY.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Tom: MM, I STILL DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
NIGGA, I SWEAR ON MY ABS --
ON MY ABS, NIGGA! -- I WILL NOT

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
TOUCH YOUR WIFE.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Tom: WELL, MY DAUGHTER WOULD
LOVE TO MEET YOU.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
A SMALL DINNER.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
NO ENTOURAGE!

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
NO PROBLEM.

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE ALL THESE

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
PEOPLE SHOWED UP.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Tom: WELL, MAYBE IF YOU
HADN'T TWEETED OUR ADDRESS TO

12:58.000 --> 12:58.000
3 MILLION PEOPLE...

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
HEY, MAN...

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Tom: YEAH, YOU WERE F'ed UP,
I KNOW.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
OKAY, SO, CHECK IT.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
KEY WITH CHICKS IS TO INSULT
THEM WHEN YOU COMPLIMENT THEM.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
NEVER BE TOO NICE.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
TRUST ME.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
GO NEG ON HER.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
KNOCK HER DOWN A PEG.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
SHE'LL LOVE IT.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
Tom: HEY, SWEETIE, YOU LOOK
LOVELY TONIGHT.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Sarah: OH, THANK YOU, HONEY.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Tom: YEAH, BUT NOT AS NICE AS
YOU THINK YOU LOOK.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
Sarah: ASSHOLE!

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Granddad: HEY, NEIGHBOR!

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
WE, UH, HEARD THERE'S A DINNER
PARTY GOING DOWN, AND I NEVER

13:33.000 --> 13:40.000
RECEIVED THE E-VITE, SO HERE WE
ARE.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Tom: YOU DIDN'T GET ONE
BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T INVITED.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
YOU GOT A LOT OF NERVE LEAVING
ME OUT IN THE COLD AND THEN

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
WANTING TO COME TO THE FLIZZY
DINNER FOR THE FREE FOOD.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Granddad: WE DIDN'T COME HERE
FOR THE FREE FOOD.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
WE CAME HERE TO WARN YOU.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
TOM, YOU GOT TO GET THAT FLIZZY
AWAY FROM YOUR WIFE!

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
IT'S BAD ENOUGH SHE'S TRAPPED IN
THIS PASSIONLESS, SEXUALLY

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
UNFULFILLING MARRIAGE WITH YOU.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
HER LADYPARTS PROBABLY BURNING
WITH UNQUENCHABLE LUST, AND YOU

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
JUST GONNA DANGLE ALL THAT
SEXINESS IN FRONT OF HER?!

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Tom: HUH?

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
Riley: MAN, IT'S LIKE, "HERE,
NIGGA, TAKE MY WIFE, PLEASE!"

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Huey: YOU KNOW HE'S GOT A
SONG CALLED --

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Tom: "I WILL DO YOUR WIFE,"
YES.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Huey: BUT THERE'S ALSO A
SONG CALLED, "WHITE WIFEBOOTY."

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
KNOW THAT?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Tom: REALLY?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
NO, NO, I DIDN'T.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER, GUYS.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
I-I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
FLIZZY'S GONNA HELP ME WORK
THINGS OUT WITH SARAH.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Granddad: OH, HE GONNA WORK
SOMETHING OUT, ALL RIGHT.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
THAT BOOTY.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Tom: HE'S HERE TO HELP.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Granddad: OH, HE GONNA HELP
HIMSELF TO THAT BOOTY!

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Tom: IT'S UNDER CONTROL!

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Granddad: HE'S GONNA --
Tom: CONTROL THAT BOOTY.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
GOT IT.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Granddad: I WASN'T GONNA
SAY THAT.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
HE GONNA BE UNDER THAT BOOTY!

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Riley: HA HA!

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
GOOD ONE, GRANDDAD!

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Tom: YEAH, HA, YEAH, VERY
FUNNY GUYS. ENOUGH.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Granddad: AS LONG AS YOU
KNOW.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
NEXT TIME YOUR KIDS ARE BORN
WITH GREAT ABS AND TATTOOS,

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
COME ON, KIDS. LET'S EAT.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Sarah:

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
OH, MY GOD, FLIZZY,
YOU'RE SO FUNNY AND SO POLITE.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ROB LIQUOR
STORES AND YOU BEAT UP WOMEN.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Tom: SARAH!

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
NO, IT'S COOL.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
SHE'S RIGHT.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I REALLY NEED TO STOP GETTING
ARRESTED.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Sarah: I'M NOT PASSING
JUDGMENT ABOUT THE CHRISTIANNA

15:05.000 --> 15:05.000
THING.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
I KNOW SOMETIMES BITCHES STEP
OUT OF LINE.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
LORD KNOWS I DO!

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Tom: HONEY, THERE ARE

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
CHILDREN AT THE TABLE.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
Sarah: NOW, I WANT TO BE
CLEAR, KIDS -- HITTING A WOMAN

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
IS WRONG...

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
UNLESS SHE HITS YOU FIRST.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
AIN'T THAT RIGHT!

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Tom: WOW.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Sarah: OR SHE TALKS ABOUT
YOUR MAMA!

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Tom: SARAH, THAT IS ENOUGH!

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Sarah: "SARAH, THAT'S
ENOUGH."

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Tom: SARAH, THAT'S IT!

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING YOURSELF IN
FRONT OF YOUR DAUGHTER AND IN

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
FRONT OF PRETTY BOY FLIZZY!

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Riley: IT'S LIKE WE NOT EVEN
HERE.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Tom: NOW, YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
YOU ARE GOING TO GO UPSTAIRS AND
SLEEP IT OFF!

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, TOM?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
HIT ME?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Tom: NO! I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU!

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
MWAH!

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Jazmine: DADDY!

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Sarah: TOM, WAIT!

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
TOM!

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Granddad: TOM, GREW A PAIR.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

15:47.000 --> 15:59.000
Riley:

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
BITTER.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANYONE ELSE
TO CALL.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
EH, NO SWEAT, MAN.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
THAT WAS ROUGH.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Tom: YEAH, IT WAS A DISASTER.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
SO MUCH FOR MAKING A MAN OUT
OF ME.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
NAW, MAN.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
TO JUST STAND UP AND WALK OUT,
THAT TOOK GUTS.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Tom: ALL I ENDED UP LEARNING
IS MY WIFE LIKES YOU BETTER.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
YOUR WIFE DOESN'T LIKE ME
BETTER.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
YOU GUYS ARE BOTH JUST BORING
AS

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
YOU'RE ROLLING WITH ME TONIGHT.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
I'M TAKING YOU TO MAN CAMP.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
BUT I DON'T HANG WITH NO
NEGATIVE-ENERGY-SUCKING

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
SO GATHER UP SOME
POSITIVITY IN THIS BITCH RIGHT

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
QUICK AND LET'S ROLL OUT.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Tom: OKAY! I CAN BE POSITIVE.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I'M NOT A LOSER.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
I CAN...GET STUFF...HAPPENING,
AND I GOT STUFF GOING ON!

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
THINGS COULD BE WORSE.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I COULD BE THAT GUY.

16:44.000 --> 17:04.000
IT'S A MIRROR, TOM.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
WELCOME.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Tom: OH, WHAT THE HECK.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
IT'S MAN CAMP.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Tom: HEY, THIS IS THE
BUY-N-FLY THAT FLIZZY ROBBED.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
FUNNY.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Tom: TYLENOL?

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
I'M TELLING YOU, WE'VE

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
WATCHED THIS THING A MILLION
TIMES.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
WE KNOW THAT'S FLIZZY.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
CASE CLOSED.

17:56.000 --> 17:56.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
HA HA HA! YEAH!

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
CUT!

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
THERE WAS A P.A. IN THE SHOT!

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
RESET!

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
MAN, I'M GETTING SWEATY.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
PRETTY'S SWEATY.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
IS SOMEONE DEAF?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
SHINE CHECK!

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
CAN YOU THROW ME A LINE?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
TRYING TO GET MY UNION CARD.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
FIND ANYTHING, COLUMBO?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Tom: UH, NOPE!

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
NOTHING.

18:22.000 --> 18:30.000
THANKS, JACK.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
MRS. DuBOIS, DO YOU MIND IF

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
WE DO A QUICK SOUND CHECK?

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Sarah: OF COURSE. GO AHEAD.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
" ON
1, 2, 3 --

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Sarah: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
HOLD ON!

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
EXCUSE ME JUST A SEC.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
YOU, UH, CAN'T SING THAT AT
JAZMINE'S PARTY.

18:48.000 --> 18:48.000
WHY NOT?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Sarah: NO! I LOVE THAT SONG.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
A LOT, ACTUALLY.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
WITH SOMETHING.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Sarah: NO, NO.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
HOW ABOUT "CAKE"?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
SURE THING, MRS. DuBOIS.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
WHAT'S UP, TIGER?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Tom: YOU FAKED THE ROBBERY.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Tom: I WATCHED THE
SURVEILLANCE TAPE, FLIZZY -- THE

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
WHOLE  TAPE.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I KNOW YOU STAGED THE ROBBERY.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
YOU JUST COULDN'T LEAVE
ALONE, COULD YOU?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Tom: WHAT ELSE WAS FAKE?

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
WERE THE NICARAGUAN GUNS FAKE?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
DID YOU REALLY EVEN BEAT
CHRISTIANNA?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
DON'T YOU  EVER  QUESTION
WHETHER OR NOT I BEAT

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
CHRISTIANNA!

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I WHUPPED THAT BITCH'S ASS!

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
BUT THE NICKI MINAJ THING WAS
STAGED.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
SHE AIN'T REALLY A CYBORG,
EITHER.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
SHE'S A NICE GIRL.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
DAMN, TOM.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST MIND YOUR
OWN BUSINESS?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Tom: I'M YOUR ATTORNEY!

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
THIS  IS  MY BUSINESS!

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
BUT WHY?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
'CAUSE I GOT TO STAY
RELEVANT! THAT'S WHY!

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
SUCKS RIGHT
NOW!

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
YOU GOT TO ACT LIKE AN IDIOT
JUST TO STAY IN THEIR

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
FACES!

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
BUT IF I CAN STAY IN JUST THE
RIGHT AMOUNT OF TROUBLE, I'LL BE

19:50.000 --> 19:50.000
ALL RIGHT.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
MY AUDIENCE IS WOMEN, TOM --
WOMEN.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
AND WOMEN HATE TO BE BORED.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Tom: LOOK, FLIZZY, I'M SORRY.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
I DON'T LIVE IN YOUR WORLD.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
I'M A SIMPLE GUY.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
I JUST WANT TO DO MY JOB, TAKE
CARE OF MY FAMILY, AND I NEEDED

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
SOME HELP TRYING TO GET MY WIFE
BACK.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
OH, YOU WANT YOUR WIFE BACK?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
HOW ABOUT NOT INVITING A NIGGA
THAT'S RICHER THAN YOU AND

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
PRETTIER THAN YOU TO MEET YOUR
WIFE?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
I MEAN, HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE,
NIGGA?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Tom: WHAT?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
BUT I-I THOUGHT WE WERE --
THOUGHT WHAT, NIGGA?!

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I'M TIRED OF YOUR PUNK-ASS!

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
FLIZZY, I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
LEAVE.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
LEAVE?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I MIGHT AS WELL MOVE IN THIS
BITCH.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
YOU ALREADY DONE  GAVE  ME YOUR
WIFE.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
THIS IS MY HOUSE!

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
JAZMINE'S GONNA BE CALLING ME
DADDY FROM NOW ON.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Tom: NOW, THAT'S ENOUGH!

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
OH, YOU MAD, TOM?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
WHAT YOU GONNA DO?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
YOU WANT TO HIT ME?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
HIT ME, TOM!

20:39.000 --> 20:39.000
Tom: HEY!

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
FLIZZY, I'M WARNING YOU...

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
HIT ME, TOM.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
COME ON, HIT ME NOW!

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
Tom: ALL RIGHT, YOU ASKED
FOR IT!

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Sarah: TOM!

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
AAH!

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
YOU'RE NOT TAKING MY FAMILY!

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Sarah: TOM! OH, MY GOD!

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
TOM, STOP!

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Ruckus: OH! I KNEW IT!

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
I KNEW IT!

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
CITIZEN'S ARREST!

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
I'M MAKING A CITIZEN'S ARREST!

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Tom:

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Riley: NOW SHUT UP!

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
STOP SQUIRMING!

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN
SILENT!

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Sarah: OH!

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
BABY, ARE YOU OKAY?!

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
YOU WERE A MANIAC!

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU LIKE THAT.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Ruckus: ALL RIGHT, GET
MOVING, GET MOVING.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
AVERT YOUR EYES, AVERT YOUR
EYES.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
JUST A NIGGA GOING TO JAIL.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Sarah: OH, HONEY, I'M SO
SORRY.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
I WAS SUCH A BITCH, AND YOU
DIDN'T DESERVE ANY OF THAT.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Tom: YES.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
YES, YOU WERE A..."B."

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Sarah: PLEASE COME HOME.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
PLEASE.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
I HAVE CAKE.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
LET'S GET YOU UPSTAIRS.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
YOU READY FOR SOME SARAH CAKE?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
NAUGHTY!

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
Tom:

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
OH, MY BACK!

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
OH! I'M SORRY.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
YEAH.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
NO
