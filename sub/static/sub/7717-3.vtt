Good morning, Dwight.

00:09.137 --> 00:11.305
Who are you?

00:11.307 --> 00:12.773
Who am I?

00:12.775 --> 00:14.008
I'm Jim.

00:14.010 --> 00:16.544
We've been working together for 12 years.

00:16.546 --> 00:18.279
Weird joke, Dwight.

00:18.281 --> 00:19.280
You're not Jim.

00:19.282 --> 00:20.681
Jim's not Asian.

00:20.683 --> 00:22.149
You seriously never noticed?

00:22.151 --> 00:25.186
Hey, hats off to you for not seeing race.

00:27.589 --> 00:29.190
All right then, Jim.

00:29.192 --> 00:31.025
Uh, why don't you tell me about that sale

00:31.027 --> 00:33.260
that you made yesterday?

00:33.262 --> 00:34.862
Uh, Wellington Systems?

00:34.864 --> 00:37.098
Sold them ten cases
of 24-pound letter stock.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.999
Or were you talking
about Krieger-Murphy?

00:39.001 --> 00:40.501
Because I didn't close that one yet,

00:40.503 --> 00:43.404
but I'm hoping I've got a
voicemail from Paul Krieger

00:43.406 --> 00:46.040
waiting for me.

00:46.042 --> 00:48.409
Please enter your password.

00:53.215 --> 00:54.615
You have one new message.

00:54.617 --> 00:55.950
How did you know?

00:55.952 --> 00:57.518
No!
No, no.

00:57.520 --> 00:58.819
That is sensitive information.

00:58.821 --> 01:00.988
Only for employees, not outsiders!

01:00.990 --> 01:02.590
Dwight, cut it out.
I'm trying to work.

01:02.591 --> 01:04.724
You don't work here!
You're not Jim!

01:04.727 --> 01:06.827
Jim, I got us that dinner reservation.

01:06.829 --> 01:08.129
- Grico's, 7:30.
- Oh, great.

01:08.131 --> 01:10.765
Can't wait.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.368
Jim's at the dentist this morning,

01:14.370 --> 01:16.704

02:04.937 --> 02:06.857
This morning, I brushed my teeth
in the shower.

02:06.858 --> 02:08.639
Saved myself 90 seconds.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.281

02:10.282 --> 02:11.559
Damn it.

Since Andy promoted me
to Assistant Regional Manager,

02:14.706 --> 02:16.146
I've been trying to step my game up.

That person has really

02:45.011 --> 02:47.511
I'm just trying to fit in
better with Andy's family.

02:47.513 --> 02:49.597
They all speak more than one language.

02:49.599 --> 02:51.181

It's just that I am taking
my driver's license test

on politics?"

Or, "what is
the best war to do?"

I'm related to Michelle Obama.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.473
Yeah, we noticed early on

05:46.475 --> 05:48.442
Andy really appreciates enthusiasm.

05:48.444 --> 05:50.244
So we decided the best way
to get ahead here

05:50.246 --> 05:51.528
is to be his cheerleaders.

05:51.530 --> 05:54.031
Ohh!

You're logging sales

"cool, man."

He called me a cool man.

would be worth it to pull over

07:01.567 --> 07:03.150

07:03.152 --> 07:05.486
Mm...
the thing is, Pam,

I'm just saying, what does it
imply in this country

07:15.531 --> 07:18.198
when a white person shares
an ancestor with a black person?

07:18.200 --> 07:20.834
You think that Andy's family owned slaves?

07:20.836 --> 07:23.236
Well, somebody owned somebody.

07:54.269 --> 07:55.536
Sure.

07:55.538 --> 07:57.738
Well, when he asked me
to look up his ancestry online,

07:57.739 --> 07:59.739
I remembered that news story
about Michelle Obama

07:59.740 --> 08:02.159
having white relatives, and I just knew

08:02.161 --> 08:04.611
he would eat that up.

08:04.613 --> 08:07.047
So he's not related to Michelle Obama?

08:49.825 --> 08:51.491
Why, is it employees' day or something?

08:51.493 --> 08:53.594
I cannot keep track of these BS holidays.

08:53.596 --> 08:55.495
Your connection to Michelle Obama

08:55.497 --> 08:58.999
has certain negative connotations.

08:59.001 --> 09:01.501
Most likely, your family were...

09:01.503 --> 09:03.687
slave owners.

09:03.689 --> 09:05.222
Does anyone else think it's possible

09:05.224 --> 09:08.275
that I come from slave owners?

09:11.646 --> 09:14.147
Whoa.

Give me a call

Got a quick question for you.

09:22.789 --> 09:24.949
Uh, no big deal, just about
America's national shame.

Thanks, bye.

09:30.180 --> 09:32.347
Your... productivity thing.

09:32.349 --> 09:33.915
Yes, yes, yes.

09:33.917 --> 09:34.933
Great.

09:34.935 --> 09:37.042
Ooh, spreadsheets.
Yum, yum.

09:37.043 --> 09:38.443
I included some

Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.

09:40.647 --> 09:42.824
I'm a teensy bit distracted right now.

09:42.826 --> 09:44.859
Look, Andy, even if your ancestors

09:44.861 --> 09:47.779
did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault.

09:47.781 --> 09:50.915

11:10.323 --> 11:12.603
I'm trying to downplay the whole

11:12.604 --> 11:13.531
Because of your slaves.

Maybe.
Probably not.

People laughed at Klingon at first,

just to talk junk about our families?

15:19.045 --> 15:21.111
Yeah, that... you're being
really mean.

15:21.113 --> 15:23.447
No, I'm proving a point, okay?

15:23.449 --> 15:25.115
We all have ancestors who may have

15:25.117 --> 15:27.284
done horrible things in the past.

15:27.286 --> 15:29.720
But it's in the past,
and it's not our fault.

15:29.722 --> 15:31.622
So we don't have to talk about it.

15:31.624 --> 15:33.975
The difference is, Andy,
that you're the only one here

15:33.977 --> 15:36.811
still benefitting from the terrible things

15:36.813 --> 15:37.962
your ancestors did.

15:37.964 --> 15:40.765
Might have done, and how do you figure?

15:40.767 --> 15:42.433
Your family's rich.

15:42.435 --> 15:43.818
I have to believe that a big part

15:43.820 --> 15:46.470
of the Bernard fortune was
earned on the backs of slaves.

15:49.314 --> 15:51.692
I'm not gonna apologize
for my family's wealth.

15:51.694 --> 15:55.145
That wealth could one day benefit society,

15:55.147 --> 15:57.131
if capital gains are ever
taxed at the same rate

15:57.133 --> 15:58.182
as earned income.

Take that!

did any Bernards

16:15.902 --> 16:18.936
ever make money in an unsavory way?

16:23.859 --> 16:25.076
[Quietly] I just asked you...

16:25.078 --> 16:26.994
why didn't you used to say that?

of yore did not own slaves.

18:08.126 --> 18:10.043

Like what?

18:23.058 --> 18:25.925
Like, hypothetically,

18:25.927 --> 18:29.095
if I said that there was another job

18:29.097 --> 18:31.547
that you and I could both have.

18:31.549 --> 18:33.382
What kind of job?

18:33.384 --> 18:38.688
Something cool,
like sports marketing, or...

does that sound like
something you'd be into?

- Right?

That sounds awesome.

- I love Philly.

- It's not even a thought...
- Not even a thought.

It's not even that far away,
I could still commute... exactly.

18:53.288 --> 18:54.954
Exactly.

18:54.956 --> 18:56.906
All right.

18:56.908 --> 18:58.007
What?
Wait, wait, wait.

18:58.009 --> 18:59.675
So what, is this happening?

18:59.677 --> 19:01.259
Oh, it's happening.

19:01.260 --> 19:02.740
Let's just keep it between you and me

19:02.741 --> 19:04.901
- for right now, all right?
- Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:04.902 --> 19:06.062
For sure, for sure, for sure.

19:06.063 --> 19:08.301
Man.
And Pam's into it?

19:08.303 --> 19:09.552
We gotta have a talk about it,

19:09.554 --> 19:10.937
but I think that she's...

19:10.939 --> 19:12.105
I think she understands...

19:12.107 --> 19:13.667
- Aw, come on, man.
- ...what this is.

19:13.668 --> 19:14.988
I thought you had something real.

19:14.989 --> 19:15.892
What?
No, no, no.

19:15.894 --> 19:17.193
Come on.
This is real.

19:17.195 --> 19:19.428
It's not real

19:19.430 --> 19:23.483
until your wife is on board.

19:24.785 --> 19:26.602
So what did you want to show me?

19:26.604 --> 19:29.705
That is quite an ugly wall, isn't it?

19:29.707 --> 19:31.774
Yeah.
It's really ugly.

19:31.776 --> 19:33.576
Needs something, doesn't it?

19:33.578 --> 19:34.794
I'm thinking,

19:34.796 --> 19:37.797
a mural.

19:37.799 --> 19:38.831
You mean me?

19:38.833 --> 19:39.832
Yes, you.

19:39.834 --> 19:42.668
You are so talented.

19:42.670 --> 19:44.504
It's going to be my next special project.

19:44.506 --> 19:47.090
Hiring Scranton's most
dangerous young muralist

19:47.092 --> 19:49.092
to paint the warehouse wall.

19:49.094 --> 19:50.560
Oh, my God, I love it!

19:50.562 --> 19:51.978
Uh... I...
Nellie,

19:51.980 --> 19:53.729
this is brilliant!

19:53.731 --> 19:54.847
- Hey!
- Hey.

19:54.849 --> 19:56.732
Can I talk to you for a second?

19:56.734 --> 20:00.103
Anything you have to say to her,

20:00.105 --> 20:01.137
you can say to me.

20:01.139 --> 20:02.188
She never loved you.

20:02.190 --> 20:03.940
What? No, I...
I got this.

20:03.942 --> 20:05.141
[Giggling] Okay.

20:05.143 --> 20:06.543
[Quietly] Okay.
This is his fault.

20:06.544 --> 20:07.860
It is not your fault.

20:07.862 --> 20:11.497
I am gonna find you
someone better, and rich.

20:11.499 --> 20:13.449
And Filipino.

20:13.451 --> 20:17.420
But we'll break that to her later.

20:17.422 --> 20:19.205
You know what this is all about?

20:19.207 --> 20:20.923
Yeah.

20:20.925 --> 20:21.991
You too, huh?

20:21.993 --> 20:25.494
Yeah.

20:25.496 --> 20:28.598
Go on, spill it.

20:28.600 --> 20:32.435
Tell her all the gory details, you snake.

20:32.437 --> 20:33.769
Hey.

20:33.771 --> 20:35.454
He deserves this.

20:35.456 --> 20:39.308
And he said I could get in on it too.

20:39.310 --> 20:42.145
[Whispering] Yeah.

20:42.147 --> 20:44.897
Oh, Pam, no.

20:44.899 --> 20:46.782
Oh, I can't bear to watch this.

20:46.784 --> 20:48.951
I don't know what I was so worried about.

20:48.953 --> 20:52.622
I have the best wife in the world.

20:52.624 --> 20:55.641
I still can't believe he didn't tell me.

21:04.745 --> 21:05.961
I was helping Nellie drive...

21:05.963 --> 21:08.798
Do not care.

21:13.370 --> 21:15.671
<i>Fonas chek!</i>

21:15.673 --> 21:18.307
<i>Dothras chek!</i>

21:18.309 --> 21:21.644
[Giggles]

21:21.646 --> 21:23.712
I like that guy.

21:23.714 --> 21:25.765
We should hook him up with Meredith.

21:25.767 --> 21:26.682
Hmm...
