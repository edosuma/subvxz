WEBVTT

00:00.039 --> 00:01.577
She's had the run
of the estate.

00:01.601 --> 00:03.536
When does she plan
to finish her epic?

00:03.604 --> 00:04.764
Some writers
take years.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.840
Winston,
after you drop us
in Hong Kong,

00:08.909 --> 00:10.274
<i>could you go</i>
<i>to Switzerland?</i>

00:10.344 --> 00:11.368
With pleasure.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.413
You've read Betty's
unfinished work?

00:13.481 --> 00:15.415
<i>Did she</i>
<i>ask my permission</i>
<i>to be her hero?</i>

00:15.483 --> 00:18.748
Russell Smythe died
an hour ago,
unknown cause.

00:19.153 --> 00:23.385
Your lady has wandered
too near the edge
of the truth.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.853
Thomas, get out of the car!

00:28.229 --> 00:29.389
Thomas!

01:48.493 --> 01:50.393
<i>Twelve seconds</i>
<i>to touch down.</i>

01:51.396 --> 01:52.693
<i>And by the way,</i>
<i>Sabre,</i>

01:52.764 --> 01:55.961
<i>for security reasons,</i>
<i>we'll be landing</i>
<i>on your private strip.</i>

01:57.402 --> 01:59.267
Twelve seconds. Check.

02:01.806 --> 02:03.273
Is the car ready?

02:03.408 --> 02:04.670
<i>Right here, sir.</i>

02:04.742 --> 02:06.767
Leaving now to collect you
at the ramp.

02:07.011 --> 02:08.478
Welcome home.

03:00.565 --> 03:02.192
May I
take that, sir?

03:02.600 --> 03:04.465
Did you have
a pleasant flight?

04:05.196 --> 04:07.096
The close
of another case,
sir?

04:07.699 --> 04:09.826
No, I'm afraid not.

04:13.137 --> 04:15.537
Why isn't it the end
of the case?

04:16.339 --> 04:17.932
Everyone's dead.

04:19.243 --> 04:20.676
<i>Well, I know that,</i>

04:20.745 --> 04:22.770
<i>but I can't wipe out</i>
<i>all the bad guys,</i>

04:22.847 --> 04:24.815
<i>when I'm only on chapter two.</i>

04:30.588 --> 04:31.987
Miss Windom?

04:32.924 --> 04:34.858
The electric typewriter
you ordered,

04:34.926 --> 04:36.723
the rental company
just delivered it.

04:36.794 --> 04:38.785
Oh, thank you, Higgins.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.261
And thank you
for being so helpful.

04:40.331 --> 04:42.492
I know I've been a pain,

04:42.567 --> 04:44.694
but I just got to try anything
to get on a roll.

04:45.169 --> 04:46.500
Miss Windom,
we've all experienced

04:46.571 --> 04:49.062
the frustration of
the writer's block syndrome.

04:49.607 --> 04:51.632
Yes, I recall once
sitting for days,

04:51.709 --> 04:53.370
searching for just
the right superlatives

04:53.444 --> 04:56.004
to describe one
Major Reginald Weddington.

04:57.348 --> 04:59.612
You see, "Humpy" Weddington
had overcome great adversity

04:59.684 --> 05:01.618
in his quest to be an officer.

05:01.686 --> 05:04.120
He was very short,
very rotund,

05:04.455 --> 05:07.652
and he had lost his left ear
in a freak rugby accident.

05:07.959 --> 05:08.948
Well...

05:09.026 --> 05:10.823
Betty.

05:12.330 --> 05:13.558
What's going on?

05:15.967 --> 05:18.367
No. No.

05:19.270 --> 05:20.760
Not my house.

05:21.038 --> 05:22.096
Thomas, wait a minute,
please.

05:22.173 --> 05:23.970
It's just
for a couple of days.

05:24.041 --> 05:25.440
Higgins!

05:30.782 --> 05:33.080
Higgins,
where do you
draw the line?

05:33.151 --> 05:35.551
For a week, she's had
the run of the estate,

05:35.620 --> 05:38.248
she's had the Ferrari,
and now she wants my...

05:38.322 --> 05:40.415
She wants the total seclusion

05:40.491 --> 05:42.925
that Mr. Masters'
guest house offers.

05:42.994 --> 05:45.895
And since
Mr. Masters wishes her
to have every consideration

05:45.963 --> 05:47.590
until her novel
is completed...

05:47.665 --> 05:49.690
And when does she plan
to finish her epic?

05:49.767 --> 05:51.257
I'm sure
I've no idea.

05:51.335 --> 05:53.826
Some writers take years
to complete
their maiden effort.

05:53.905 --> 05:54.894
Years!

05:54.972 --> 05:57.202
What, Robin's just gonna
let her move in here

05:57.275 --> 05:59.505
and abuse his hospitality
indefinitely?

05:59.577 --> 06:02.102
There are precedents
for such presumptions.

06:05.583 --> 06:06.982
Magnum,
please collect
your things

06:07.051 --> 06:09.144
and come
to the main house
immediately.

06:09.220 --> 06:11.984
I've prepared you
a very nice room
with a magnificent view.

06:12.056 --> 06:15.890
View? I don't want a view!
I just want my...

06:16.127 --> 06:17.287
Higgins!

06:17.962 --> 06:22.126
Magnum will finish his tantrum
and be out of your way
shortly, Miss Windom.

06:23.334 --> 06:24.801
Good writing.

06:25.503 --> 06:26.970
Higgins!

06:38.583 --> 06:39.880
Thomas, please try
to understand.

06:39.951 --> 06:41.885
I have to be alone
to concentrate.

06:42.386 --> 06:43.853
I understand, Betty.

06:44.989 --> 06:46.320
Excuse me.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.527
You're welcome to whatever
is in the refrigerator.

06:53.598 --> 06:55.691
I'm eating on the run
right now, anyway.

06:57.001 --> 06:59.629
Oh, right. The case.
Tell me about it. Is it fun?

07:00.705 --> 07:02.070
Fun? No.

07:02.206 --> 07:05.175
It's just a dull,
routine insurance job.

07:05.243 --> 07:07.677
Russell Smythe,
my seventh hit-and-run
this year.

07:07.745 --> 07:09.872
I go to the hospital
one more time,

07:09.947 --> 07:11.676
I ask him
a few more questions

07:11.749 --> 07:13.546
and then he gets
his insurance check.

07:13.618 --> 07:15.313
Doesn't that
sound exciting?

07:16.854 --> 07:18.014
That's it?

07:18.089 --> 07:19.647
What about
the hit-and-run driver?

07:19.724 --> 07:21.419
I am having someone
check on the car

07:21.492 --> 07:23.016
but we don't have much
to go on.

07:23.094 --> 07:24.618
Rick's working
on it, right?

07:24.896 --> 07:26.090
Is it true

07:26.163 --> 07:29.030
that you don't work
on a case without his
and T.C.'s help?

07:30.468 --> 07:32.265
Rick sort of softly
blew that information

07:32.336 --> 07:34.566
in my ear
when he asked me out.

07:35.006 --> 07:36.906
What's the ID on the car?

07:37.308 --> 07:38.570
Gray. That's it.

07:38.643 --> 07:40.804
And that's why
we're not going
to find it.

07:41.279 --> 07:42.803
And speaking of cars,

07:42.880 --> 07:46.043
the one I am renting
is eating up most
of my meager fee.

07:46.117 --> 07:47.175
I don't suppose,

07:47.251 --> 07:50.414
since you're going
to be cloistered here
working in my house,

07:50.988 --> 07:54.151
that the Ferrari is free, hmm?

07:54.592 --> 07:57.083
Well, I was just about
to go for a drive.

07:57.295 --> 07:59.263
You know, just sensing
that car's power

07:59.330 --> 08:01.491
and the breeze
in my face and...

08:01.565 --> 08:02.759
It really helps me to think.

08:02.833 --> 08:04.562
Do you know
the sensation I mean?

08:04.635 --> 08:05.863
I used to.

08:06.170 --> 08:07.501
Goodbye, Betty.

08:09.640 --> 08:11.107
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

08:11.175 --> 08:12.369
I've got it!

08:12.743 --> 08:15.735
Why don't I come with you
and we can both use the car?

08:17.648 --> 08:18.910
No.

08:21.986 --> 08:23.977
<i>Not this trip, Collette.</i>

08:26.123 --> 08:28.591
You know
how deceptively dangerous

08:28.659 --> 08:30.650
these little
insurance cases can be.

08:30.861 --> 08:32.828
I'll call you from Rome.

08:37.168 --> 08:38.635
Good luck.

08:40.837 --> 08:42.669
And be careful.

09:06.297 --> 09:07.958
Sebastian

09:09.133 --> 09:10.566
succumbed

09:11.335 --> 09:14.429
to the smooth,

09:15.339 --> 09:16.601
sensuous

09:17.842 --> 09:20.140
bite of the sherry

09:20.211 --> 09:23.772
<i>as he mused the mystery</i>
<i>of the Hans Leopold case.</i>

09:23.848 --> 09:26.612
<i>As the balmy sea breeze</i>
<i>bathed his thoughts,</i>

09:26.684 --> 09:29.118
<i>one truth washed</i>
<i>crystal clean in his mind.</i>

09:29.320 --> 09:32.289
<i>Interpol, the vast</i>
<i>police force of Europe,</i>

09:32.356 --> 09:35.086
<i>only called him in</i>
<i>on special situations.</i>

09:35.159 --> 09:38.822
<i>And a case</i>
<i>with the Interpol code name</i>
<i>"Insurance Claim"</i>

09:38.896 --> 09:40.796
<i>was always very special.</i>

09:40.865 --> 09:43.265
<i>On through the shadows</i>
<i>of the South Sea sun,</i>

09:43.334 --> 09:45.097
<i>the trio sped to the airport.</i>

09:45.169 --> 09:47.194
<i>Boris, the devoted manservant,</i>

09:47.271 --> 09:49.831
<i>Winston, the cavalier comrade</i>
<i>and pilot,</i>

09:49.907 --> 09:54.276
<i>and Sebastian Sabre,</i>
<i>international investigator</i>
<i>at large.</i>

09:54.612 --> 09:56.807
This Hans Leopold case,

09:56.881 --> 09:59.611
isn't it a bit pedestrian
for you, Sabre?

10:00.051 --> 10:03.043
A man's hands singed
by a laser gun

10:03.120 --> 10:05.554
from a passing car
on the streets of Brussels?

10:05.756 --> 10:07.587
Hans Leopold is...

10:08.526 --> 10:12.826
Was the most renowned
diamond cutter
in all of Europe, Winston.

10:13.297 --> 10:16.061
Interpol wants to know
why someone would
go to the trouble

10:16.133 --> 10:19.728
of destroying Hans' hands
without harming him otherwise.

10:20.037 --> 10:21.800
So do I.

10:24.575 --> 10:26.065
Sabre Two.

10:26.644 --> 10:27.770
Yes, one moment.

10:28.679 --> 10:31.580
It's Mr. Swift, sir,
calling from Monte Carlo.

10:31.649 --> 10:35.551
<i>Sebastian always</i>
<i>welcomed calls</i>
<i>from his friend and confidant,</i>

10:35.619 --> 10:39.385
<i>the luck-laden libertine</i>
<i>and lord of the gaming tables.</i>

10:39.457 --> 10:41.391
<i>Swift,</i>
<i>how's your luck running?</i>

10:41.459 --> 10:42.653
Oh, excellent.

10:42.726 --> 10:45.217
I've a Middle Eastern princess
supplying my chips.

10:45.329 --> 10:47.889
And I have the information
that you needed, Sebastian.

10:47.965 --> 10:51.093
A printout
of every license number
of every car in Brussels.

10:51.168 --> 10:52.396
I'll telex it to you.

10:52.470 --> 10:54.199
No, it could be intercepted.

10:54.338 --> 10:55.930
After Winston
drops me in Rome,

10:56.006 --> 10:58.304
he can hop over
to Monaco and pick it up.

10:58.375 --> 10:59.740
Gladly.

11:00.111 --> 11:02.375
Monique will be happy
to see me.

11:02.446 --> 11:04.846
<i>Then I'll leave it</i>
<i>at the desk</i>
<i>at the Hotel LeMeur.</i>

11:04.915 --> 11:06.940
I have to be
in Switzerland tonight.

11:07.017 --> 11:09.542
High-stakes poker
with some bankers.

11:09.720 --> 11:11.483
<i>Thanks for the help, Swift.</i>

11:16.927 --> 11:19.361
I just need
the one car
in Brussels

11:19.430 --> 11:21.523
that will confirm
my theory, Winston,

11:21.599 --> 11:24.966
that Hans Leopold was attacked
by a diamond theft syndicate,

11:25.236 --> 11:28.171
or by one man

11:28.239 --> 11:29.763
with a syndicate's power.

11:30.708 --> 11:34.144
Sir, am I reading
your thoughts?

11:34.478 --> 11:35.672
King Solomon?

11:35.746 --> 11:37.043
Yes, Boris.

11:37.148 --> 11:40.675
And this time I won't quit
until I know who he is.

11:40.751 --> 11:43.345
I'm meeting
Inspector Vittorio Romano
of Interpol

11:43.420 --> 11:45.047
at the hospital in Rome,

11:45.122 --> 11:47.022
to interview Hans.

11:47.391 --> 11:50.554
Sir, you won't
want to be in Italy
without the Ferrari.

11:50.628 --> 11:52.152
Shall I
Air Express it?

11:52.263 --> 11:54.163
No. Collette needs it.

11:54.265 --> 11:55.994
And you need Collette.

11:56.066 --> 11:57.829
Why didn't you let her
come along?

11:57.902 --> 11:59.836
Winston,
she's writing, okay?

11:59.904 --> 12:01.428
<i>No, she's not.</i>

12:02.606 --> 12:04.233
Lunch break.

12:06.610 --> 12:09.579
<i>Working insurance jobs</i>
<i>like the Russell Smythe case</i>

12:09.647 --> 12:12.241
<i>always made me feel</i>
<i>more like a pencil pusher</i>

12:12.316 --> 12:14.147
<i>than a private investigator,</i>

12:14.218 --> 12:17.153
<i>but I hadn't been</i>
<i>totally honest with Betty</i>

12:17.221 --> 12:19.849
<i>when I referred</i>
<i>to this one</i>
<i>as just routine.</i>

12:20.191 --> 12:22.921
<i>It was the same</i>
<i>as all the others</i>
<i>on the surface,</i>

12:22.993 --> 12:25.962
<i>but I had a feeling</i>
<i>that there was</i>
<i>some unexplored scene</i>

12:26.030 --> 12:27.395
<i>in this little drama.</i>

12:27.998 --> 12:30.899
<i>I'd already had two visits</i>
<i>with Russell at the hospital,</i>

12:31.135 --> 12:32.534
<i>but the feeling</i>
<i>was strong enough</i>

12:32.603 --> 12:34.969
<i>to ask for</i>
<i>one more meeting</i>
<i>with the victim,</i>

12:35.039 --> 12:38.600
<i>the insurance guy, Dan Morgan,</i>
<i>and a large supporting cast.</i>

12:38.742 --> 12:41.802
Oh, come on,
what's going on, Morgan?
Why is this PI hassling me?

12:41.879 --> 12:44.040
Look, no one's
hassling you, Russell.

12:44.114 --> 12:46.014
Thomas just felt
there were
a few more questions

12:46.083 --> 12:48.051
to be asked,
I guess.

12:48.619 --> 12:50.484
Look, Russell,
surely you must remember

12:50.554 --> 12:52.852
something more
about the car
that hit you.

12:52.923 --> 12:55.448
It was a gray sedan,
all right?
Gray. That's it.

12:55.526 --> 12:57.221
Gray. Just like
I'm gonna be

12:57.294 --> 12:59.262
by the time I get
this insurance check.

12:59.330 --> 13:02.231
Aren't you a little
overly anxious
to get paid, Mr. Smythe?

13:03.033 --> 13:04.762
Betty, what are you
doing here?

13:05.369 --> 13:06.358
Well, I was just on a break

13:06.437 --> 13:09.235
and I thought I might meet you
and we'll have a little lunch.

13:09.306 --> 13:10.500
Who's she?

13:11.342 --> 13:13.310
Would you mind
waiting outside,
please?

13:14.411 --> 13:15.639
Sure.

13:17.348 --> 13:19.782
There's just one question,
Mr. Smythe.

13:21.285 --> 13:22.877
Are you certain
that there is no one

13:22.953 --> 13:25.285
that might deliberately
try to run you over?

13:25.689 --> 13:27.418
You're right, lady.
You're right.

13:27.491 --> 13:29.083
See, I'm in a very
dangerous business.

13:29.159 --> 13:30.456
I run a deli!

13:30.527 --> 13:32.495
Some guy comes in
and asks for mayo,

13:32.563 --> 13:33.894
I give him Thousand Island
on his turkey

13:33.964 --> 13:35.431
and he puts a contract
out on my life!

13:35.499 --> 13:38.024
Come on! Come on,
give me a break!

13:38.102 --> 13:41.367
<i>I have never heard</i>
<i>of King Solomon!</i>

13:43.674 --> 13:47.269
Hans, please,
you must cooperate.

13:47.778 --> 13:50.770
Sebastian and Interpol
have been working for years

13:50.848 --> 13:53.442
to learn King Solomon's
true identity.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.881
Inspector Romano,
I'm sorry

13:55.953 --> 13:58.251
but I have nothing more
to say to you.

13:59.023 --> 14:00.888
Are you certain, Hans?

14:01.025 --> 14:03.994
I've traced the license number
of a gray sedan in Brussels

14:04.061 --> 14:06.222
to the Worldex
Import Export Company.

14:06.297 --> 14:07.628
The same concern

14:07.698 --> 14:10.895
that was implicated
in an earlier search
for King Solomon,

14:11.168 --> 14:12.226
when he eluded me.

14:12.303 --> 14:15.670
Hans, did the laser shots
that hurt your hands

14:15.906 --> 14:17.339
come from a gray sedan?

14:17.474 --> 14:18.532
I don't know.

14:19.009 --> 14:21.739
But if you're trying
to imply that I would
cut stolen diamonds

14:21.812 --> 14:24.372
for the world's
most infamous
jewel thief,

14:25.249 --> 14:26.614
no.

14:27.384 --> 14:29.909
I thought you said
you'd never heard
of King Solomon.

14:29.987 --> 14:31.454
Collette.

14:32.089 --> 14:33.886
Oh, please don't be angry
with me, darling.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.481
I felt that you needed me.

14:36.660 --> 14:38.821
Hans, did the King
have your hands destroyed

14:38.896 --> 14:41.262
to warn you
to stay silent
about his identity?

14:41.699 --> 14:43.894
Would you please stop this?

14:45.369 --> 14:48.770
The burning
of Hans' hands
was an accident.

14:50.107 --> 14:52.598
Can you not let me
return to Belgium?

14:52.676 --> 14:54.371
Have I not suffered enough?

14:57.748 --> 14:59.841
Release him, Vittorio.

15:00.417 --> 15:04.183
Just one more
question, Hans.

15:05.589 --> 15:09.116
You are a lifelong resident
of Belgium, correct?

15:09.927 --> 15:11.451
<i>Ja,</i> of course.

15:11.762 --> 15:13.730
Then why do you have
a German accent?

15:13.964 --> 15:16.398
<i>It's questions like that,</i>
<i>that can get us sued.</i>

15:16.467 --> 15:17.661
I said
I was sorry, Dan.

15:17.735 --> 15:19.669
I didn't know Betty
was going to show up

15:19.737 --> 15:21.728
but she did ask
a valid question.

15:21.805 --> 15:23.773
Valid? Thomas,
what's got into you?

15:23.841 --> 15:27.299
Why have you picked this case
to pull a cloak-and-dagger
routine on me?

15:27.378 --> 15:29.141
I don't know, Dan,
there's something...

15:29.213 --> 15:30.680
Not right. I know.
You told me.

15:30.748 --> 15:33.911
Look, would you just see
his doctor and lawyer
and get all the papers signed,

15:33.984 --> 15:35.349
so I can issue
Russell's check?

15:35.419 --> 15:37.080
Then decide
what's not right.

15:37.154 --> 15:38.849
Yeah, I'll see him
this afternoon.

15:38.922 --> 15:41.049
Without the lady detective,
please?

15:42.426 --> 15:43.688
Right.

15:47.097 --> 15:49.122
Hey,
ready for lunch?

15:49.633 --> 15:52.158
I saw this cute little place
on the way over here.

15:52.403 --> 15:54.337
I want to tell you
my theory on Russell.

15:54.405 --> 15:57.238
Betty, no.
You've helped me
enough, okay?

15:57.307 --> 16:00.435
But I've already...
Go home. Write. Please.

16:35.612 --> 16:37.739
What are you doing?

16:41.885 --> 16:42.977
Thomas!

16:43.053 --> 16:45.044
Thomas, get out
of the car!

16:46.490 --> 16:48.685
Stop it!
What are you doing?
Stop!

16:49.827 --> 16:51.488
Thomas, get out
of the car!

16:51.562 --> 16:53.325
What are you doing?

16:53.397 --> 16:56.025
Thomas! Thomas! Oh, my God!

16:56.099 --> 16:57.828
Thomas! Thomas!

17:00.404 --> 17:01.598
Stop it!

17:19.957 --> 17:21.549
Thomas.

17:23.527 --> 17:24.824
Thomas.

17:29.266 --> 17:30.995
Thomas, are you okay?

17:43.795 --> 17:47.356
<i>Hey, Thomas, Betty, whoever.</i>
<i>It's Rick, Thomas.</i>

17:47.499 --> 17:49.091
<i>Hey look, forget about</i>
<i>finding the backhoe.</i>

17:49.167 --> 17:51.328
<i>There's too many</i>
<i>on the island to trace.</i>

17:51.403 --> 17:53.200
<i>Ditto on the gray sedans.</i>

17:53.538 --> 17:55.096
<i>And, Betty...</i>
<i>Well, I called earlier</i>

17:55.173 --> 17:56.834
<i>to see if you'd</i>
<i>changed your mind</i>
<i>about dinner,</i>

17:56.908 --> 18:00.173
<i>but Higgins told me</i>
<i>that you were staying over</i>
<i>at Thomas' place, so...</i>

18:00.245 --> 18:02.975
<i>Hey, kids, no hard feelings</i>
<i>on this end, okay?</i>

18:03.482 --> 18:05.609
<i>You guys have fun. See you.</i>

18:12.958 --> 18:15.688
<i>Kiss of the Sabre</i>
by Phillip Davy?

18:16.094 --> 18:17.186
Phillip Davy?

18:17.796 --> 18:19.320
Do you know
what time it is?

18:19.531 --> 18:21.658
It's 9:00 a.m.,
Phillip Davy.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.260
Robin said
a mystery-adventure
authoress

18:25.370 --> 18:26.632
can't make it
unless she uses

18:26.705 --> 18:28.400
some dumb masculine
pen name.

18:28.473 --> 18:32.273
Betty, no writer,
under any name,
can make it,

18:33.078 --> 18:34.841
unless they write something.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.111
I worked until after 3:00.

18:37.182 --> 18:39.173
And what about investigators?

18:39.251 --> 18:41.515
You should be at the hospital
confronting Russell.

18:41.586 --> 18:44.282
Thomas, it's obvious
he tried to have
somebody kill you

18:44.356 --> 18:47.848
because he's afraid
that you'll find out
he's faking his injuries.

18:48.026 --> 18:49.493
Russell is not faking it.

18:49.594 --> 18:52.791
Then who turned
your subcompact
into a sub subcompact?

18:52.898 --> 18:54.126
I don't know!

18:54.199 --> 18:57.134
And I can't find out
until I wrap up
Russell's case.

18:57.202 --> 18:59.261
And I can't do that
without transportation.

18:59.338 --> 19:02.637
So, Betty, please, please.
Could I have the keys
to my car?

19:02.941 --> 19:06.672
Fine, no problem.
As long as you take me
with you.

19:08.613 --> 19:11.810
Why? It's going to be
a long, boring day.

19:11.883 --> 19:14.875
Looking for
a killer backhoe
isn't boring.

19:14.953 --> 19:17.285
Now, now, Betty, come on.
Now, wait a minute.

19:17.489 --> 19:20.083
I am going to lunch
with Russell's attorney

19:20.158 --> 19:22.524
and then I have to get him
to sign some paperwork.

19:22.594 --> 19:24.789
Then I'm going
to see his doctor.
More paperwork.

19:24.863 --> 19:26.125
No killer backhoe,
okay?

19:26.198 --> 19:28.132
I promise I won't
get in your way.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.394
I'll just spend
my time writing

19:29.468 --> 19:31.060
and I'll be there
if you need my help.

19:31.136 --> 19:32.194
No. No.

19:32.270 --> 19:34.431
You were enough help
for me yesterday.

19:35.073 --> 19:37.667
Now, you can call Higgins,
you can even call Robin,

19:37.743 --> 19:41.907
but I am leaving here
by myself,
in that car, now.

19:43.248 --> 19:45.546
So just give me
my keys, okay?

19:58.897 --> 20:01.263
Clumsy Phillip.

20:04.469 --> 20:05.697
I'll drive.

20:07.572 --> 20:10.097
<i>And don't take time</i>
<i>to pack, Collette.</i>

20:15.080 --> 20:17.378
We'll grab you
a wardrobe in Paris.

20:17.816 --> 20:21.718
<i>Collette was ecstatic</i>
<i>when Sebastian decided</i>
<i>to let her stay with him.</i>

20:22.053 --> 20:24.817
<i>They lounged in the Lear</i>
<i>high above the Atlantic.</i>

20:24.990 --> 20:28.721
<i>Silence filled</i>
<i>the infinite space</i>
<i>of sea and sky,</i>

20:28.794 --> 20:32.059
<i>save for the soft caress</i>
<i>of wind across the wings</i>

20:32.130 --> 20:34.496
<i>and the tinkling</i>
<i>of two glasses.</i>

20:40.605 --> 20:43.836
Collette, these people
that I'm questioning

20:43.909 --> 20:45.968
about the Leopold affair.

20:46.445 --> 20:48.242
Some of them know me.

20:48.313 --> 20:50.474
They might speak
more freely

20:50.749 --> 20:52.182
if you saw them alone.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.741
I'll have
the King's identity
this time,

20:54.820 --> 20:56.185
whatever the cost.

20:58.356 --> 21:00.824
As we're en route
to Paris, sir,

21:00.892 --> 21:02.723
I've taken the liberty
of preparing a lunch

21:02.794 --> 21:06.662
of <i>Canard a I'orange,</i>
<i>Épinards au jus,</i>
and <i>Gratin dauphinois.</i>

21:06.731 --> 21:08.426
I hope you'll find it
to your liking.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.661
Oh, yes, Boris...

21:11.937 --> 21:12.961
I'm sorry.

21:13.038 --> 21:15.632
I should have told you
we're lunching
on the Champs Élysées,

21:15.707 --> 21:18.232
with Jacques Arnot,
Hans Leopold's attorney.

21:18.310 --> 21:20.437
Very good, sir.
Not to worry.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.740
The Dobermans
will enjoy
this little lunch.

21:24.382 --> 21:25.974
Jacques Arnot?

21:26.618 --> 21:28.552
Surely you don't
suspect him?

21:29.221 --> 21:32.452
Being the most successful
attorney in the free world,

21:32.524 --> 21:33.855
would make
an excellent cover.

21:33.925 --> 21:37.258
Yes, even the great
Jacques Arnot is suspect.

21:37.362 --> 21:39.853
My client
is totally disabled,
Mr. Magnum.

21:40.198 --> 21:42.723
He's lucky if he ever walks
again, much less works.

21:42.901 --> 21:46.393
Mr. Meeder, if you will just
give me your signature

21:46.471 --> 21:50.601
verifying that
you have given me
all the facts on the case

21:50.675 --> 21:54.133
as you know them, and then
I'll talk to Dr. Su.

21:54.212 --> 21:56.203
All right. Where's my pen?
Wait a minute, I know
it's in here somewhere.

21:56.281 --> 21:58.340
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What facts did he give you?

21:58.416 --> 22:01.817
All you said was that
Russell was due the maximum
on his accident policy

22:01.887 --> 22:03.184
and some doctor
would verity it.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.279
Bill Su. I...

22:04.356 --> 22:06.483
I've worked with him
on cases before.

22:06.925 --> 22:08.620
So there's just
one doctor involved?

22:08.693 --> 22:10.957
Shouldn't we get
a second opinion?
Betty, you promised!

22:11.162 --> 22:12.595
Yeah, but if you're
just going to sit there

22:12.664 --> 22:14.461
and let the insurance company
get taken for a ride...

22:14.533 --> 22:16.797
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a minute!

22:16.868 --> 22:20.964
I don't think
I like your insinuation there,
Miss Windom.

22:21.039 --> 22:22.631
No, Mr. Meeder,
wait a minute.

22:22.707 --> 22:24.197
Betty doesn't understand.
She...

22:24.276 --> 22:26.141
Betty understands perfectly.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.139
I have seen
your television commercials,
Mr. Meeder.

22:29.247 --> 22:31.044
"Insurance claims
our specialty."

22:31.149 --> 22:33.845
So you want to be sure
you get what you can

22:33.919 --> 22:36.114
because you get a percentage
of what you collect, right?

22:36.187 --> 22:37.176
Betty!

22:37.255 --> 22:39.519
That's it!
Everybody
gets paid.

22:39.624 --> 22:41.592
You, the hospital,
the doctor...

22:41.660 --> 22:43.628
Okay, that's it,
that's it. Over.
That's all, it's over.

22:43.728 --> 22:46.094
No! Wait!
Now, wait a minute.

22:46.932 --> 22:48.058
You...
No. Oh, no.

22:48.133 --> 22:51.398
No, no, I'm gonna tell
Dan Morgan I've got grounds
for a slander suit.

22:51.469 --> 22:53.960
You can't hold
Superior Mutual
responsible for Betty's...

22:54.039 --> 22:55.370
I can sure
as hell try.

22:55.440 --> 22:58.341
<i>She made</i>
<i>slanderous remarks</i>
<i>on their behalf.</i>

23:00.912 --> 23:03.380
Jacques, please,
come back, sit down.

23:03.548 --> 23:06.449
Monsieur,
how dare she imply

23:06.518 --> 23:09.043
that I,
Jacques Arnot,

23:09.120 --> 23:11.782
would be involved
in such a plot.

23:11.856 --> 23:14.518
Well, Collette may be
a wonderful warrior
of a woman,

23:14.593 --> 23:16.959
but she is
not always
a diplomat.

23:17.228 --> 23:19.560
I simply suggested
that perhaps Hans' hands

23:19.631 --> 23:21.098
were not
burned at all,
Jacques.

23:21.232 --> 23:23.166
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Collette, please.

23:23.234 --> 23:26.601
What would be there
to gain in such a charade?

23:26.771 --> 23:29.069
Hans is a diamond cutter.

23:29.140 --> 23:32.007
His hands are his fortune.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.066
Exactly.

23:34.045 --> 23:35.342
And if the world believed

23:35.413 --> 23:37.643
that those gifted fingers
were destroyed,

23:37.716 --> 23:39.616
then he could have
a much greater fortune,

23:39.684 --> 23:43.211
secretly cutting
stolen diamonds
for King Solomon.

23:45.924 --> 23:48.552
Forgive me,
<i>mademoiselle,</i>

23:48.627 --> 23:52.427
but that
is a ridiculous theory.

23:52.530 --> 23:53.519
Ridiculous.

23:53.632 --> 23:55.463
Then I suppose
you'll have
no objection

23:55.533 --> 23:59.629
to our having
another doctor
examine Hans' hands?

24:01.206 --> 24:03.174
Easy, Collette, darling.

24:04.109 --> 24:08.409
Hans Leopold
is a patient
of Dr. Ling.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.675
The famous Dr. Ling?

24:13.752 --> 24:15.913
You think he could
be King Solomon?

24:15.987 --> 24:18.683
He certainly becomes
the most likely candidate.

24:19.424 --> 24:22.052
Winston,
after you drop us
in Hong Kong,

24:22.127 --> 24:24.220
could you go
to Switzerland
for Swift?

24:24.295 --> 24:25.592
<i>I may need him.</i>

24:26.898 --> 24:28.058
With pleasure.

24:28.333 --> 24:31.166
I failed to thank Madge
the last time I visited her.

24:35.540 --> 24:39.374
Collette, Ling and I
are old adversaries.

24:40.378 --> 24:42.642
He'll say nothing
in front of me.

24:44.683 --> 24:47.379
So, he's the one
that you want me
to see alone?

24:48.053 --> 24:49.953
You know he's
a practicing degenerate.

24:50.021 --> 24:52.455
The stories of what
he's done to women...

24:54.025 --> 24:55.754
But it's worth the risk,

24:56.261 --> 24:58.661
if that's what
you need from me.

25:03.168 --> 25:06.535
<i>Spinal injuries</i>
<i>are common in this kind</i>
<i>of situation.</i>

25:07.105 --> 25:10.131
If you will look right here,
at the three lower vertebrae,

25:11.576 --> 25:13.544
there's pretty
severe damage.

25:13.611 --> 25:16.273
Not really
enough left
to be operable.

25:16.481 --> 25:19.006
Then there's
compound fracture
of the left femur

25:19.084 --> 25:21.917
and multiple fractures
of metatarsals.

25:21.986 --> 25:24.853
Bill, I have seen enough.
Russell is a total...

25:25.256 --> 25:28.248
If you could just sign
this stuff for me?

25:28.326 --> 25:30.055
Sure. Excuse me.

25:35.834 --> 25:38.064
I told you I should have
talked to him alone.

25:38.136 --> 25:40.070
This is getting us nowhere.

25:42.173 --> 25:45.267
You know,
I find these X-rays
really fascinating.

25:45.410 --> 25:47.742
Can they
be retouched?

25:48.113 --> 25:49.637
I suppose
it's possible.

25:50.081 --> 25:52.311
But believe me,
these breaks are real.

25:52.383 --> 25:54.783
I had to set
every one of them.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.109
Right.

25:56.454 --> 25:59.946
So I suppose other doctors
have examined them also?

26:05.497 --> 26:08.125
Excuse me.
I have another patient.

26:10.301 --> 26:11.893
Thanks, Bill.

26:12.604 --> 26:15.664
What? What'd I say?
Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

26:15.740 --> 26:18.208
I was just trying
to find out
whether or not someone

26:18.276 --> 26:20.107
Could alter X-rays,
that's all.

26:20.178 --> 26:22.612
Betty, I have had it.

26:22.881 --> 26:26.214
You're going home
so that I can finish
this investigation.

26:27.352 --> 26:29.013
What investigation?

26:29.087 --> 26:30.554
What did they
hire you for, anyway?

26:30.622 --> 26:32.817
Any insurance man
could do what you're doing.

26:33.191 --> 26:34.317
Thomas...

26:35.160 --> 26:36.252
What?

26:38.296 --> 26:40.594
Aren't you
forgetting something?

26:42.133 --> 26:44.931
Don't you remember
Russell tried to kill you?

26:49.507 --> 26:50.872
Your lady

26:51.075 --> 26:55.409
has wandered too near
the edge of the truth, Sabre.

26:56.681 --> 26:58.512
Dispense with him.

26:58.650 --> 27:02.814
But take the girl
to my operating room.

27:12.697 --> 27:13.823
Stop!

27:14.065 --> 27:15.794
Or I'll punch you
in the square root of 18

27:15.867 --> 27:17.926
and you all become targets
for heat-seeking missiles.

27:18.002 --> 27:19.367
Sebastian!

27:19.604 --> 27:23.802
Drop your ingenious abacus,
Mr. Sabre.

27:30.648 --> 27:31.910
Here's one
for you, Swift.

27:33.985 --> 27:35.816
And this one's mine.

27:47.131 --> 27:48.325
Wow.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.659
Lucky I had a tailwind
from Switzerland.

27:50.735 --> 27:51.724
Check.

27:52.237 --> 27:53.534
What happened to Ling?

27:53.605 --> 27:56.699
He escaped through
a secret panel
in the ceiling.

28:00.311 --> 28:03.371
Never mind.
More important
we return to Brussels.

28:03.681 --> 28:06.343
Hans Leopold's life
could be in danger.

28:06.818 --> 28:11.346
Brussels. Winston,
Micheline and Helga
will be pleased to see us.

28:11.589 --> 28:13.716
Lunch for five
on the jet, sir?

28:14.125 --> 28:15.717
Haven't we already
had lunch?

28:15.793 --> 28:17.624
<i>No. You decided</i>
<i>you didn't want to.</i>

28:17.695 --> 28:19.356
<i>I am starving.</i>

28:19.964 --> 28:21.090
There wasn't time.

28:21.165 --> 28:23.929
I spent an hour
convincing Ronnie Meeder
not to sue

28:24.002 --> 28:26.470
and another hour
coming down here
to the hospital.

28:26.537 --> 28:28.164
Now, maybe
we can have dinner,

28:28.239 --> 28:29.968
if you wait for me
in the car.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.133
That's not fair.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.234
It was my idea
that we come back
and talk to him.

28:33.311 --> 28:35.006
Not we, I.

28:35.246 --> 28:37.237
I am going in there
to see Russell

28:37.315 --> 28:39.977
because you have me
halfway convinced
that he's faking it.

28:40.051 --> 28:42.110
But you are going
to wait right here...

28:42.186 --> 28:43.710
Thomas, what are you
doing here?

28:43.788 --> 28:45.312
Didn't you get my message?

28:45.390 --> 28:47.881
What message? I was going
to your office after...
Never mind.

28:47.959 --> 28:50.655
Just don't do any more
on the investigation, okay?

28:50.728 --> 28:53.424
And don't go inside.
Ronnie Meeder's in there

28:53.498 --> 28:56.228
and I have enough troubles
without him seeing
you two again.

28:56.301 --> 28:59.600
Dan, now, wait a minute.
I straightened things out
with Meeder.

28:59.704 --> 29:02.537
Thomas, Russell Smythe
died an hour ago.

29:03.174 --> 29:04.539
Cause unknown.

29:04.809 --> 29:06.777
Bill's gonna do
an autopsy.

29:17.086 --> 29:19.350
It was
a blood clot in his lung.

29:19.489 --> 29:23.255
Bills says that
just happens sometimes
with serious injuries.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.221
I wanna go to bed.

29:26.396 --> 29:28.591
Oh, that's it?
You're just gonna drop it?

29:28.665 --> 29:31.634
You're not gonna try
to find out which one of
those men tried to kill you?

29:31.701 --> 29:33.134
Betty, when do you stop?

29:33.236 --> 29:34.294
You were wrong.

29:34.404 --> 29:36.804
Nobody involved
with Russell
tried to kill me

29:36.873 --> 29:39.467
And Russell definitely
wasn't faking it.

29:39.542 --> 29:40.873
<i>Hi, lovebirds.</i>

29:40.943 --> 29:43.138
<i>Thomas,</i>
<i>for what it's worth,</i>
<i>a friend on the dock says</i>

29:43.212 --> 29:46.670
<i>a gray '83 Buick with minor</i>
<i>fender damage got shipped</i>
<i>to Maui yesterday.</i>

29:46.749 --> 29:48.478
<i>Registered owner,</i>
<i>Donna Jenkins,</i>

29:48.551 --> 29:53.318
<i>and, by the way,</i>
<i>we need to discuss our deal</i>
<i>on this job, right?</i>

29:53.389 --> 29:54.913
<i>Call me.</i>

29:55.358 --> 29:57.223
See? Is that fate,
or what?

29:57.293 --> 29:58.419
Just when
you're ready
to quit,

29:58.494 --> 30:00.325
you get a big lead
on the gray sedan.

30:00.396 --> 30:03.297
Right. I always knew
Donna Jenkins was our girl,

30:03.366 --> 30:04.731
whoever she may be.

30:04.801 --> 30:07.634
Now, Betty, please,
once and for all,
just drop it.

30:07.704 --> 30:09.296
The case is closed,
okay?

30:09.372 --> 30:11.101
No, it isn't.
Not for me, it isn't.

30:11.174 --> 30:12.869
Look, just because
Russell died,

30:12.942 --> 30:14.603
doesn't mean
that the doctor
and the attorney

30:14.677 --> 30:16.872
couldn't be running
some sort of scam!
No!

30:17.613 --> 30:19.410
Now, I've known
Bill Su for years.

30:19.482 --> 30:20.506
He's a reputable doctor.

30:20.583 --> 30:22.676
That's one opinion,
Thomas!

30:22.752 --> 30:25.721
If you'd have listened to me
and let me talk to him alone,

30:25.788 --> 30:27.688
we would know for sure,
wouldn't we?

30:27.757 --> 30:28.781
Good night, Betty.

30:28.858 --> 30:30.485
Would you just wait.
Thomas, please, wait.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.824
Just wait a minute,
please?
Wait, just wait.

30:34.363 --> 30:36.126
Did you ever
get a chance
to eat?

30:36.199 --> 30:39.965
I mean, since I've taken over
your kitchen and everything,

30:40.236 --> 30:43.137
the least I can do
is fix us dinner.

30:45.208 --> 30:47.267
I'm not very hungry
but thank you.

30:49.078 --> 30:52.172
<i>It was a deeply dejected</i>
<i>Sebastian,</i>

30:52.248 --> 30:54.773
<i>who sat</i>
<i>in the sensuous</i>
<i>morning sun,</i>

30:54.851 --> 30:57.319
<i>on the patio</i>
<i>of the Sabre's Scabbard.</i>

30:57.787 --> 31:02.417
<i>Few had ever witnessed</i>
<i>the strong and secure</i>
<i>Sebastian Sabre</i>

31:02.592 --> 31:07.427
<i>in self-exile,</i>
<i>on a Ionely desolate island</i>
<i>of defeat.</i>

31:08.331 --> 31:09.593
Mr. Sabre?

31:10.433 --> 31:13.960
It's Crepes Italian, sir.
Your favorite breakfast.

31:14.437 --> 31:15.495
What?

31:16.038 --> 31:18.871
Oh, yes, Boris, thank you,

31:18.941 --> 31:21.307
but I seem to have lost
my appetite.

31:24.847 --> 31:26.405
Borie baby.

31:26.716 --> 31:29.651
Why don't you tell us
another one
of your wonderful stories?

31:29.719 --> 31:31.846
Sebastian always
finds them amusing.

31:32.021 --> 31:33.613
Yes, Mr. Sabre.

31:33.756 --> 31:36.748
Let me tell you
about the uniquely
bizarre episode

31:36.826 --> 31:40.057
I experienced while the valet
of Prince Abdul Ben Assar.

31:40.530 --> 31:43.761
The Prince discovered
his favorite wife
had taken a lover

31:44.300 --> 31:47.098
and ordered me
to personally execute
the rake...

31:47.170 --> 31:48.364
Boris.

31:48.771 --> 31:50.238
I've heard that one.

31:50.773 --> 31:54.004
I do find it very funny,
but not now.

31:58.247 --> 32:02.013
Sebastian, please,
the Leopold case is over.

32:02.185 --> 32:03.379
You must forget it.

32:04.287 --> 32:07.779
I can't. I'm responsible
for Hans' death, Winston.

32:08.624 --> 32:11.320
I should have realized
Dr. Ling would silence him

32:11.394 --> 32:13.589
the moment we came
too close to the truth.

32:13.763 --> 32:17.790
Leopold died
of a blood disease,
the results of his burns.

32:17.867 --> 32:20.097
Do you really believe
a doctor of Ling's competence

32:20.169 --> 32:22.364
could overlook
a simple blood disease?

32:28.544 --> 32:29.977
Sabre's Scabbard.

32:31.113 --> 32:32.341
One moment.

32:32.715 --> 32:34.910
A call sure
to cheer you, sir.

32:35.251 --> 32:37.651
Mr. Swift.
He's back
in Monte Carlo.

32:38.354 --> 32:39.912
<i>Sebastian, good news.</i>

32:39.989 --> 32:42.981
<i>I have some</i>
<i>interesting information</i>
<i>regarding the Leopold case.</i>

32:43.192 --> 32:45.160
However, before we go
any further...

32:45.528 --> 32:47.428
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

32:48.197 --> 32:50.688
My luck has seemed
to have left me
in the last few hours.

32:50.766 --> 32:53.758
Swift, please, I'll wire you
$50,000 immediately.

32:53.836 --> 32:56.202
<i>You're too generous,</i>
<i>Sebastian.</i>

32:56.305 --> 33:00.969
Dr. Ling, Jacques Arnot
and Hans Leopold
all own stock

33:01.210 --> 33:03.508
in Worldex
Import Export Company.

33:03.646 --> 33:06.945
And the gray Mercedes
that you found
registered to Worldex

33:07.083 --> 33:10.712
is actually the personal car
of one Eva Leopold.

33:11.220 --> 33:12.278
Hans' wife?

33:12.355 --> 33:13.344
<i>The same.</i>

33:14.123 --> 33:16.489
I have to get back
to the game now, Sebastian.

33:16.592 --> 33:18.253
Thanks for the 50.

33:20.630 --> 33:23.121
That's why
I could never
catch the King.

33:23.499 --> 33:25.558
Winston,
we're going back
to Rome.

33:25.635 --> 33:28.035
Boris,
get me Vittorio
at Interpol,

33:28.104 --> 33:31.369
and then call Collette
and tell her we leave
in ten minutes.

33:34.043 --> 33:35.135
What's the matter?

33:36.178 --> 33:39.045
We didn't know
how to tell you, sir,

33:39.115 --> 33:40.810
in your depressed state.

33:42.952 --> 33:46.911
Sebastian,
Collette took a flight
to Hong Kong this morning.

33:49.859 --> 33:52.885
Apparently,
she's investigating
on her own.

33:54.664 --> 33:56.029
<i>Collette was right.</i>

33:56.098 --> 33:59.556
<i>The access code</i>
<i>to Dr. Ling's computer</i>
<i>was King Solomon.</i>

33:59.635 --> 34:01.865
<i>Then suddenly,</i>
<i>there was what she needed.</i>

34:01.938 --> 34:04.406
<i>Secret data</i>
<i>on the diabolical doctor.</i>

34:04.674 --> 34:07.939
<i>Forty three jewel thieves,</i>
<i>all acquitted</i>
<i>on medical grounds,</i>

34:08.043 --> 34:11.502
<i>all his patients</i>
<i>and all defended</i>
<i>by Jacques Arnot.</i>

34:11.746 --> 34:13.806
<i>Then came</i>
<i>Ling's financial records.</i>

34:13.916 --> 34:16.476
<i>There were no less</i>
<i>than seven</i>
<i>diamond companies</i>

34:16.552 --> 34:20.386
<i>that he, Jacques Arnot,</i>
<i>and Hans Leopold</i>
<i>jointly owned.</i>

34:20.489 --> 34:22.422
But which one of them
is the King?

34:22.792 --> 34:24.225
All of them.

34:24.627 --> 34:26.219
Sebastian, Vittorio.

34:26.963 --> 34:28.828
The King
isn't one man,
Collette.

34:28.898 --> 34:31.661
It's the code name
for an entire
jewel theft ring.

34:31.734 --> 34:33.793
Ling, Arnot,
hundreds of others.

34:33.869 --> 34:36.337
Even Hans Leopold
before they killed him.

34:36.806 --> 34:40.333
Hans is not dead,
Mr. Sabre.

34:41.210 --> 34:43.643
Marcello! Angelo!
Arrest them!

34:46.916 --> 34:48.440
Yes, Inspector.

34:48.516 --> 34:53.386
There are many,
even at Interpol,
who are with us.

34:54.389 --> 34:56.051
So my theory was correct.

34:56.726 --> 34:58.751
Hans' hands were not burned.

34:59.528 --> 35:02.793
Destroy the hands
of the world's
most famous diamond cutter?

35:03.933 --> 35:05.332
No, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

35:05.401 --> 35:09.462
We simply had Hans' wife
shoot a harmless beam at them.

35:09.638 --> 35:13.631
And you, so close
to discovering the secret,

35:14.243 --> 35:15.437
he had to die.

35:15.711 --> 35:17.076
So unfortunately
for you three,

35:17.146 --> 35:19.808
death will not be
such a lucrative charade.

35:20.983 --> 35:23.417
Wait a minute,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

35:25.488 --> 35:27.319
If Hans can be alive,

35:27.923 --> 35:29.390
why can't Russell?

35:29.992 --> 35:30.981
<i>Russell?</i>

35:31.293 --> 35:33.454
Must I post
a note on the door?

35:33.662 --> 35:35.095
You no longer
live here.

35:35.164 --> 35:37.064
Higgins,
it makes sense.

35:37.133 --> 35:40.398
I mean,
it's a little far-fetched,
but basically she's right.

35:41.037 --> 35:43.198
You've read Betty's
unfinished work?

35:44.840 --> 35:46.000
Did she give you permission?

35:46.075 --> 35:49.044
Did she ask my permission
to be her hero and lover?

35:49.545 --> 35:51.911
Is something going on
of which I am unaware?

35:52.515 --> 35:54.176
Higgins, where's Betty?

35:54.417 --> 35:56.908
She asked for the keys
to the Audi
early this morning.

35:57.186 --> 35:58.414
Magnum.

35:58.487 --> 36:01.513
Read <i>Kiss of the Sabre.</i>
It's self-explanatory.

36:04.527 --> 36:06.893
A mystery novel?
That's why you got me
down here?

36:06.962 --> 36:08.691
That's your big emergency?

36:08.764 --> 36:11.096
Dan, I didn't have time
to come by your office.

36:11.167 --> 36:13.032
I wanted to get here
before Betty did.

36:13.102 --> 36:16.265
Oh, and before she got done in
by the evil Dr. Su, huh?

36:16.338 --> 36:18.533
This girl's already
jeopardized your chances

36:18.607 --> 36:20.370
of ever working
another case for us

36:20.443 --> 36:23.071
and now you buy
this crazy story.

36:23.145 --> 36:26.171
I don't want
to believe it either,
Dan, but it adds up.

36:26.282 --> 36:29.080
Do you know
how many accident cases
Superior Mutual has had

36:29.151 --> 36:31.642
where Bill Su
and Ronnie Meeder
were both involved?

36:31.720 --> 36:32.709
Well, quite a few, I guess.

36:32.788 --> 36:33.880
Over 50.

36:33.956 --> 36:35.981
And all of them cut and dried,
just like Russell's.

36:36.058 --> 36:39.994
And only one doctor
your company trusts
to verify injuries. Bill.

36:40.062 --> 36:44.396
I see, so the whole hospital
is getting a kickback
with him, right?

36:44.667 --> 36:46.635
No, no, not the top people.

36:46.702 --> 36:49.330
But, yeah.
There could've been
enough orderlies and nurses

36:49.405 --> 36:51.703
in on the scheme
to cover up the fake victims.

36:52.141 --> 36:55.235
Dan, I just wanted
to give you a chance
to talk to Bill with me

36:55.311 --> 36:56.744
before I call
the police, that's all.

36:56.812 --> 36:57.938
Police?

36:58.481 --> 37:01.348
Oh, come on,
wait a minute. Thomas.

37:01.784 --> 37:03.581
You need some proof.

37:04.353 --> 37:05.411
Proof?

37:05.488 --> 37:07.718
Ronnie Meeder's
brother-in-law
owns a backhoe,

37:07.790 --> 37:10.122
just like the one
that annihilated
my rental car.

37:10.192 --> 37:13.855
And Donna Jenkins
just sent her damaged
gray sedan to Maui.

37:14.497 --> 37:15.725
That's Russell's ex-wife.

37:15.798 --> 37:17.129
And beneficiary.

37:19.068 --> 37:20.330
Look, Dan,

37:20.402 --> 37:22.597
I'm not looking forward
to this any more than you are,

37:22.671 --> 37:24.229
but there is enough proof.

37:24.473 --> 37:27.101
Nobody's looked forward
to it, Thomas.

37:35.217 --> 37:37.378
We're really sorry
you had to find out.

37:37.786 --> 37:41.552
But you have to understand,
we can't let you and Betty go.

37:41.957 --> 37:43.982
This has been
a real good deal
for all of us

37:44.059 --> 37:45.651
and nobody's
ever been hurt

37:45.728 --> 37:47.662
but Superior Mutual Insurance,

37:48.664 --> 37:49.961
up to now.

37:55.886 --> 37:58.616
T. C: "Monique will be happy
to see me"?

37:59.356 --> 38:01.324
How could Betty think of me

38:01.392 --> 38:04.555
as a womanizing,
trigger-happy
clothes hound?

38:04.628 --> 38:08.064
That's hardly
as offensive as finding
your dearest experiences

38:08.132 --> 38:11.158
parodied as Boris'
amusing stories,

38:11.368 --> 38:14.030
or finding yourself
caricatured as the servant

38:14.638 --> 38:17.766
to the master
of Sabre's Scabbard.
Good God.

38:17.942 --> 38:20.342
Well, I don't know
where she got the idea
for this Swift guy,

38:20.411 --> 38:21.605
but he is terrific.

38:21.679 --> 38:24.648
I mean, I can understand
why Robin is sold on her
as a writer.

38:24.882 --> 38:26.907
This girl can really
turn a phrase.

38:26.984 --> 38:30.920
Yes. In several
illiterated directions
simultaneously.

38:31.588 --> 38:35.319
However, it's the content,
not the quality of her book
that currently concerns me.

38:35.392 --> 38:37.087
No, come on, Higgins.

38:37.194 --> 38:40.027
No way that junk
can be based
on anything serious enough

38:40.097 --> 38:41.724
to cause any real problems.

38:41.799 --> 38:45.030
Based on Magnum's reaction
to it, I have to disagree.

38:45.469 --> 38:46.834
T.C., I think he's right.

38:46.904 --> 38:48.064
There's all sorts
of stuff in here

38:48.138 --> 38:49.969
straight from Thomas'
hit-and-run case.

38:50.040 --> 38:52.406
Yes, and if Betty's naiveté
as an authoress

38:52.476 --> 38:54.171
carries over
into her sleuthing,

38:54.244 --> 38:56.371
there's every possibility
that somehow

38:56.447 --> 38:59.780
she and Magnum
are living the jeopardy
of her final page.

39:00.517 --> 39:03.452
Well, we better break
this plot down
or hope for some more clues.

39:03.554 --> 39:05.044
Why bother?

39:05.155 --> 39:09.455
I'll just go warm up the jet
and we'll hop over to Rome

39:09.593 --> 39:12.289
and perform
our usual daring rescue.

39:12.363 --> 39:14.024
T.C., please.

39:14.131 --> 39:17.498
Betty has been gone
for over 24 hours,
Magnum for 18.

39:17.801 --> 39:19.701
I think we must try
any possible avenue

39:19.770 --> 39:21.761
that will determine
their whereabouts.

39:21.905 --> 39:23.770
<i>Maui's not</i>
<i>that hard to find.</i>

39:24.174 --> 39:25.698
This part is.

39:25.909 --> 39:28.139
You're in
a very remote part
of the island

39:28.379 --> 39:30.347
where nobody, I mean
nobody's gonna find you.

39:30.414 --> 39:31.745
Or you, right, Russell?

39:31.815 --> 39:33.112
Why don't you
lay off the subject

39:33.183 --> 39:34.582
of my untimely death,
huh, Magnum?

39:34.651 --> 39:37.848
Since you and your
meddlesome girlfriend here
are the cause of it.

39:38.389 --> 39:41.756
Where's Bill and the others?
They just taking off
and leaving us to you?

39:41.825 --> 39:45.056
No. No, see,
they're having a meeting.

39:45.396 --> 39:48.923
DR. LING: <i>For the purpose</i>
<i>of deciding your fate.</i>

39:49.600 --> 39:53.331
I'm sure my men
will enjoy cutting Mr. Sabre

39:53.404 --> 39:55.929
into shark-sized bites,

39:56.073 --> 39:58.598
and casting him
into the sea.

39:59.109 --> 40:00.508
And <i>Signorina</i> Collette?

40:11.455 --> 40:12.649
Collette,

40:13.690 --> 40:15.248
I have a confession to make.

40:15.325 --> 40:17.885
I was concerned
about your welfare and I...

40:19.163 --> 40:22.132
I read your diary
on the way to Hong Kong.

40:22.766 --> 40:24.324
You did
a beautiful job.

40:24.401 --> 40:26.665
All the pieces
of the puzzle
were there,

40:26.737 --> 40:28.796
and the things
you wrote about
us, well...

40:28.872 --> 40:31.136
I never knew
I meant so much
to you.

40:31.608 --> 40:33.337
Don't give up hope,
Collette.

40:35.479 --> 40:37.208
Boris has the diary.

40:40.250 --> 40:43.014
Let us just hope
that Collette was correct

40:43.087 --> 40:45.851
about the secret passage
in Ling's roof.

40:45.923 --> 40:47.857
Can we hit
that small a target?

40:47.925 --> 40:50.951
It will be difficult
from 38,000 feet,

40:51.228 --> 40:55.130
but not impossible
with Winston's
precise calculations.

40:58.402 --> 40:59.460
Winston.

40:59.536 --> 41:00.525
<i>Yes, Swift?</i>

41:00.604 --> 41:02.128
How long before we go in?

41:02.206 --> 41:04.140
T. C: <i>We could roam</i>
<i>around here forever.</i>

41:04.208 --> 41:06.836
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>how many houses</i>
<i>there are on Maui?</i>

41:06.910 --> 41:09.470
<i>Not many with a backhoe</i>
<i>and a gray sedan outside.</i>

41:09.546 --> 41:10.535
<i>Orville...</i>

41:10.614 --> 41:13.310
<i>T.C., I know for a fact</i>
<i>that that backhoe</i>
<i>was shipped over here</i>

41:13.417 --> 41:14.714
<i>and the gray sedan, too.</i>

41:14.785 --> 41:16.013
<i>Why else but to hide them?</i>

41:16.086 --> 41:18.646
<i>T.C., why are you</i>
<i>flying around</i>
<i>the southern tip?</i>

41:18.856 --> 41:22.257
<i>I told you,</i>
<i>the tax appraiser's office</i>
<i>locates Dr. Su's cottage</i>

41:22.326 --> 41:23.793
<i>somewhere in the north.</i>

41:23.861 --> 41:26.125
T. C: <i>Will you just let me</i>
<i>do the flying?</i>

41:27.064 --> 41:29.624
T. C: <i>This is crazy.</i>
<i>I am setting down</i>
<i>and calling the police.</i>

41:29.700 --> 41:31.099
<i>And have them do what?</i>

41:31.168 --> 41:32.965
<i>Read</i> Kiss of the Sabre?

41:33.170 --> 41:35.195
<i>T.C., please, fly north.</i>

41:36.807 --> 41:39.435
<i>Thanks, guys.</i>
<i>It really means a lot to us.</i>

41:39.776 --> 41:41.141
One minute, Thomas.

41:41.378 --> 41:43.778
That's all we can give you.
I'm sorry.

41:43.847 --> 41:45.041
Well, that's better
than nothing.

41:45.115 --> 41:47.413
We just want
to say goodbye.

41:47.484 --> 41:49.111
We really care
about each other.

41:49.186 --> 41:51.711
Hey. Wait a minute.
Why are we leaving
these people alone?

41:51.788 --> 41:54.757
They're not
going nowhere,
they're tied up. Come on.

41:54.825 --> 41:56.053
Thank you.

41:58.428 --> 41:59.725
All right, Betty,

41:59.830 --> 42:02.492
I think you should know
that I have no great
heroic way

42:02.566 --> 42:03.590
of getting us out of this.

42:03.667 --> 42:05.362
I'm wide open
for suggestions.

42:05.435 --> 42:07.198
What would
Sebastian Sabre do?

42:07.404 --> 42:08.598
You read it?

42:09.139 --> 42:11.334
Oh, my God,
I could die.
Yes, you could!

42:11.408 --> 42:12.739
Oh, my God.
We could!

42:12.809 --> 42:14.800
So will you use
that wild imagination

42:14.878 --> 42:18.075
and help me think
of something to get us
out of this door safely.

42:19.483 --> 42:20.848
A candle.

42:20.918 --> 42:22.909
Sebastian would hold
his ropes over the flame

42:22.986 --> 42:25.546
until they burned in two
and then he'd pretend
to still be tied up.

42:25.622 --> 42:28.318
And then he would jump
all four of them,
when they came back in.

42:28.392 --> 42:31.793
Betty, look around you.
Do you see a candle
anywhere in this room?

42:31.929 --> 42:34.022
And only
the Sebastian Sabre

42:34.097 --> 42:37.328
would be dumb enough
to jump four people
all by himself.

42:37.401 --> 42:40.268
He's not dumb.
He's confident.
Criminals aren't.

42:40.337 --> 42:41.804
Any man
with real self-confidence

42:41.872 --> 42:43.863
could handle
four insecure killers.

42:46.210 --> 42:48.201
Thomas, come on.
No more time.

42:49.580 --> 42:51.673
Come on, Meeder,
you're an attorney.

42:51.748 --> 42:54.273
What's the difference
between the penalties
for insurance rip-offs

42:54.351 --> 42:56.216
and two counts
of murder one?

42:56.286 --> 42:59.153
Oh, well,
don't think that we didn't
discuss that, Magnum.

42:59.223 --> 43:01.589
We figure
we have to take the chance.

43:02.626 --> 43:04.059
Dan, I mean,

43:04.394 --> 43:05.622
I'm starting
to get a little scared.

43:05.696 --> 43:07.596
You're not
double-crossing me,
are you?

43:08.498 --> 43:09.692
What is he
talking about?

43:09.766 --> 43:11.028
Beats the hell out of me.

43:11.101 --> 43:12.830
You know,
there's a copy
of that statement

43:12.903 --> 43:14.894
that goes to the police,
if I don't get back.

43:14.972 --> 43:16.496
What statement?

43:16.573 --> 43:19.599
My written statement
exposing this whole operation.

43:20.143 --> 43:22.771
Dan bought my silence
in exchange for his promise

43:22.846 --> 43:23.870
that I could
become a partner.

43:23.947 --> 43:24.971
We just set up
this little trip

43:25.048 --> 43:26.606
to reduce the size
of management.

43:27.618 --> 43:31.611
Come on. Can't you see
he's winging it to stay alive?

43:31.788 --> 43:33.312
Really? He sounds pretty
sure of himself

43:33.390 --> 43:34.914
for a guy who's about
to be killed.

43:34.992 --> 43:36.926
Nobody asked
for your opinion,
Russell.

43:36.994 --> 43:38.791
Yeah, well,
I'm giving it, okay?

43:38.862 --> 43:41.490
I mean, if you guys
had done away with him
with the backhoe

43:41.565 --> 43:43.055
instead of just trying
to scare him...

43:43.133 --> 43:46.193
Hey! Stop it.
Just get these two
in the car.

43:46.536 --> 43:49.937
No, not until I figure
this statement thing out.

43:50.073 --> 43:52.405
Russell,
there is no statement!

43:53.243 --> 43:55.404
Damn it!
Stop flailing
that gun around.

43:55.479 --> 43:57.242
Don't do it,
Russell.
Now, Russell...

43:57.314 --> 43:58.804
Give me that gun
before you hurt...

44:02.052 --> 44:03.644
Get it. Go on, get it!

44:06.123 --> 44:10.082
<i>Five, four, three, two one.</i>

44:12.829 --> 44:14.228
Good luck, Boris.

44:18.302 --> 44:21.169
Oh, my God!

44:22.406 --> 44:24.567
<i>There it is, T.C.</i>
<i>There's the backhoe.</i>

44:25.275 --> 44:26.367
Chopper!

44:26.443 --> 44:27.671
Let's get out
of here!

44:56.640 --> 44:57.834
T. C: Thomas!

45:01.078 --> 45:03.842
Lucky I got the tailwind
from Oahu.

45:22.366 --> 45:23.560
Betty.

45:26.069 --> 45:27.263
Rick's waiting.

45:27.337 --> 45:28.736
All right, thanks.

45:30.407 --> 45:35.310
I hope you know
that I wanted to take you
to the airport personally,

45:35.379 --> 45:38.644
but I'm already late
for a meeting on a case.

45:42.419 --> 45:44.751
Listen, I straightened
everybody out

45:45.889 --> 45:47.413
about our...

45:47.724 --> 45:48.884
You know,

45:49.226 --> 45:50.659
our relationship.

45:51.661 --> 45:55.062
Yeah. Yeah,
it was pretty funny
them thinking that we...

45:55.699 --> 45:57.633
I mean,

45:57.701 --> 45:59.965
we never even made it
to dinner.

46:00.303 --> 46:03.830
You know,
I think Robin was right
about your talent.

46:04.274 --> 46:05.571
I just...

46:06.209 --> 46:07.904
I feel that you need to...

46:07.978 --> 46:09.570
Try a different approach?

46:10.847 --> 46:12.212
Right.

46:12.382 --> 46:15.943
You know,
I was considering
a romance novel.

46:16.019 --> 46:17.008
Oh, yeah?

46:17.087 --> 46:18.076
Yeah.

46:18.455 --> 46:20.252
What do you think
about the name

46:21.024 --> 46:22.514
Collette Crystal?

46:24.661 --> 46:25.923
Oh, it's okay.

46:26.062 --> 46:28.053
I like Betty Windom
a lot better.

46:28.698 --> 46:29.756
Why don't you
just start over

46:29.833 --> 46:31.300
and write one in her name?

46:38.642 --> 46:41.634
I gotta run.
Another insurance case.

46:41.778 --> 46:43.006
<i>And you know</i>
<i>how tricky</i>

46:43.079 --> 46:45.479
<i>these little</i>
<i>insurance cases</i>
<i>can be.</i>

46:47.017 --> 46:49.315
<i>Collette knew</i>
<i>that Sebastian was right.</i>

46:49.486 --> 46:51.613
<i>The diary must be destroyed.</i>

46:51.755 --> 46:54.383
<i>The King Solomon syndicate</i>
<i>was not finished,</i>

46:54.724 --> 46:57.750
<i>only severed into pieces</i>
<i>by the Sabre's slash.</i>

46:58.295 --> 47:01.492
<i>To have the diary in the hands</i>
<i>of the remaining Solomites</i>

47:01.698 --> 47:04.030
<i>would be fatal</i>
<i>to all concerned.</i>

47:04.701 --> 47:08.068
<i>It hurt to watch</i>
<i>her pages of passion</i>
<i>fight for their life</i>

47:08.138 --> 47:10.231
<i>and die on the outgoing tide,</i>

47:10.740 --> 47:13.140
<i>but it was</i>
<i>what Sebastian wanted.</i>

47:13.910 --> 47:17.437
<i>And she never</i>
<i>refused him anything.</i>
