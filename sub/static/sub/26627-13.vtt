00:23.565 --> 00:25.316
[woman on TV] <i>After the attack</i>
<i>at the</i> Bulletin

00:25.400 --> 00:27.610
<i>and the horrible tragedy</i>
<i>at the Clinton Church,</i>

00:27.694 --> 00:31.698
<i>what will it take before people realize</i>
<i>that Wilson Fisk was set up by Daredevil?</i>

00:31.781 --> 00:35.368
[man] <i>People are beginning to realize</i>
<i>Fisk was the victim of a smear campaign.</i>

00:35.452 --> 00:37.871
<i>Daredevil was the one behind it all.</i>

00:37.954 --> 00:41.416
<i>And what about Daredevil's apologists</i>
<i>like Blake Tower and Karen Page?</i>

00:41.499 --> 00:43.668
-[woman] <i>She should be in jail.</i>
<i>-</i>[man] <i>We have breaking news</i>

00:43.752 --> 00:47.130
<i>that Fisk has invited</i>
<i>many of New York's most powerful figures</i>

00:47.213 --> 00:50.717
<i>to the Presidential Hotel</i>
<i>for some kind of surprise announcement.</i>

00:50.800 --> 00:51.634
[woman] <i>Oh.</i>

00:58.975 --> 01:02.145
[panting] Kidnapping me
will get you nothing.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.272
-What is Fisk planning?
-Planning?

01:05.023 --> 01:07.734
I scouted his hotel. Extra security.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.904
Preparations for some big event.
What is it?

01:10.987 --> 01:13.364
What Fisk will do to me
is infinitely worse--

01:13.448 --> 01:14.699
[Matt grunts]

01:16.451 --> 01:18.495
Things are about to get very bad for you.

01:19.370 --> 01:23.458
What is Fisk planning?

01:23.541 --> 01:24.918
Do you mind if I come in?

01:31.049 --> 01:32.133
[Fisk gasps softly]

01:32.926 --> 01:33.927
Marriage?

01:34.010 --> 01:35.720
He's been planning the ceremony
for months.

01:35.804 --> 01:41.059
He's gonna charm the press and the public
and make Hell's Kitchen love him again.

01:42.352 --> 01:46.564
-Do I look that nervous?
-Yes, a little, but it's charming.

01:56.574 --> 02:00.703
I never knew that I could feel this way
until the day that we met.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.457
I didn't think that I was capable,

02:05.041 --> 02:06.835
that there would be someone...

02:09.170 --> 02:11.881
that I would care for
more than my own life.

02:13.258 --> 02:17.554
That her happiness would be
more important than anything else.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.264
And then...

02:21.808 --> 02:28.773
a terrifying thought occurred to me
that perhaps my feelings were a trick.

02:29.732 --> 02:32.443
The self-deception of a vain man.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.531
That the only reason why I love you

02:36.614 --> 02:39.576
is because of the way
I see my reflection in your eyes.

02:41.286 --> 02:44.122
That thought, it fills me with dread.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.750
The fear that...

02:50.044 --> 02:51.671
that I don't deserve you...

02:53.173 --> 02:54.799
and that I am broken.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.679
Don't you understand we're all broken?

03:00.763 --> 03:05.476
The point is to find the person
whose broken pieces fit with yours.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.771
[Matt] <i>You're gonna tell me everything.</i>

03:08.855 --> 03:12.066
I wanna know where everyone is gonna be.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.069
Anyone who could stop me.

03:15.612 --> 03:16.446
Stop you?

03:16.988 --> 03:18.239
From killing Fisk.

03:18.990 --> 03:22.744
He controls all of the FBI agents
who are guarding him.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.204
The hotel is a fortress.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.288
Is that a no?

03:26.080 --> 03:28.082
-You'll never get to him.
-Sounds like a no.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.794
[Felix screaming] [wailing]

03:38.218 --> 03:40.511
I can give you something better!

03:41.554 --> 03:42.805
I'm listening.

03:43.723 --> 03:48.686
I witnessed Ms. Marianna
order the murder of Agent Nadeem.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.941
And Fisk ordered many.

03:54.108 --> 03:57.028
Agent Winn. Julie Barnes!

03:57.111 --> 03:59.113
I could testify!

03:59.656 --> 04:01.532
I know about Winn and Nadeem.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.160
Who's Julie Barnes?

04:09.040 --> 04:10.166
The rose.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.169
I think.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.026
[theme music playing]

05:41.758 --> 05:44.218
Tell me again
how you ended up dangling off a building?

05:44.969 --> 05:46.012
I tripped. Get him out of here.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.900
I thought "ambulance chaser"
was a figure of speech.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.402
Not one of your best burns, Detective.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.529
I'm not in the mood to be clever today.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.156
Yeah, me neither.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.241
We had him, Foggy.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.203
We were this goddamn close.

06:10.745 --> 06:11.704
I know.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.583
Instead of locking up that bald asshole,

06:15.666 --> 06:18.378
I had to tell Mrs. Nadeem
she'd never see her husband again.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.504
How did that happen?

06:20.630 --> 06:21.631
I don't know. Listen.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.929
Something's been brought to my attention.

06:29.013 --> 06:32.225
As an officer of the court,
I'm compelled to report it.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.269
I have reason to believe

06:35.353 --> 06:38.189
that someone's gonna try
to murder Wilson Fisk today.

06:38.272 --> 06:39.273
Someone, huh?

06:40.149 --> 06:43.194
About what time is this going down?
I wanna have some popcorn ready.

06:43.277 --> 06:45.655
Need I remind you
of your obligation to protect and serve?

06:45.738 --> 06:47.824
Stick your obligation up your ass, Nelson.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.953
If Fisk disappears,
all his bullshit goes with him.

06:52.036 --> 06:56.124
And the FBI agents on his payroll
just fold back into the mix.

06:56.707 --> 06:59.043
Including the one who shot Ray.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.338
Don't think of it as protecting Fisk.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.590
Think of it as protecting
the case we can build

07:04.674 --> 07:06.592
against the shitbags who helped him.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.303
Once we get them,
they'll turn faster than old milk.

07:09.387 --> 07:13.015
Still, with Fisk gone,
we'll get 'em eventually.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.185
Brett, please.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.272
This certain someone
we're talking about...

07:21.107 --> 07:22.316
he's angry.

07:23.109 --> 07:27.405
But I know he'll do the right thing
if I can just slow him down.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.574
Give him time to think.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.954
I'll beef up the perimeter
around the hotel.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.624
-But I'm sending in my C team.
-Thank you.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.751
I'm talking rookies and retirees.

07:43.379 --> 07:46.466
[Hattley] After the body
of Supervisory Special Agent Winn

07:46.549 --> 07:47.967
was found in the Hudson,

07:48.050 --> 07:51.053
search divers also recovered
the murder weapon.

07:51.596 --> 07:55.975
The registered service sidearm
of fellow FBI agent Ray Nadeem.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.520
When agents went
to take Nadeem into custody,

07:59.604 --> 08:01.606
he drew a weapon to resist arrest

08:01.689 --> 08:04.817
and forced his fellow agents
to kill him in self-defense.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.945
<i>Sadly, we may never know</i>
<i>what kind of mental instability</i>

08:08.029 --> 08:11.157
<i>drove Ray Nadeem</i>
<i>to commit this senseless act.</i>

08:12.158 --> 08:15.578
<i>But our thoughts and prayers go out</i>
<i>to the families of all the agents</i>

08:15.661 --> 08:17.497
<i>who have been impacted by these events.</i>

08:17.580 --> 08:21.584
Press is calling me a liar.
FBI is calling Ray mentally unstable.

08:21.667 --> 08:22.710
[scoffs]

08:23.294 --> 08:25.505
Ray's grand jury testimony is sealed,

08:25.588 --> 08:29.884
so Fisk is just throwing up smokescreens
until people forget and move on.

08:29.967 --> 08:30.885
Yeah?

08:31.427 --> 08:33.387
Well, unless Matt figures out
some way to stop him,

08:33.471 --> 08:35.973
he's going to get away with it.
With all of it.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.892
You mean unless Matt kills him.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.604
Shouldn't have warned Mahoney.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.649
If the police have Fisk surrounded,

08:44.732 --> 08:46.692
maybe Matt won't be able
to go through with it.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.487
Or maybe he'll get arrested. Or worse.

08:49.570 --> 08:50.404
Karen--

08:50.488 --> 08:53.658
Look, I'm not saying that I want
him to kill Fisk. I don't want that.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.995
What if it's the only way?

08:58.829 --> 09:01.666
It's, uh... It's not murder
if it's self-defense, right?

09:01.749 --> 09:05.795
Technically, plotting to kill someone is
the exact legal opposite of self-defense.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.255
You know what I mean.

09:09.590 --> 09:10.591
I get it.

09:11.175 --> 09:14.762
Our best shot at taking down Fisk
died with Nadeem.

09:16.138 --> 09:18.558
But yesterday was also a good day...

09:18.641 --> 09:21.352
-[Karen sighs]
-...because Matt came back to us.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.104
The real Matt.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.814
Yeah, for, like, a minute maybe.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.275
Eventually, he'll come to his senses.

09:27.358 --> 09:31.237
Matt's Matt because he believes that
everyone deserves a shot at redemption.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.488
Except Fisk.

09:33.030 --> 09:35.700
Everyone. It's a Catholic thing.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.535
That's why he doesn't kill people.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.745
If he crosses that line...

09:41.122 --> 09:43.624
Matt will never be able
to forgive himself.

09:43.708 --> 09:48.254
And being around us will just remind him
of who he was and what he's done.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.800
-Yeah, we'd really lose him, wouldn't we?
-Forever, this time.

09:57.471 --> 09:59.348
[cell phone vibrating]

10:00.308 --> 10:01.559
[sighs]

10:04.186 --> 10:05.187
Hello?

10:08.649 --> 10:09.817
Yes.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.320
Can I ask why?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.948
Uh, no need. I know where you are.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.367
What? What is it?

10:18.451 --> 10:19.577
[sighs]

10:20.661 --> 10:22.330
The FBI wants me to come in.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.208
It's Fisk.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.712
-Yeah. It might be.
-Might be?

10:30.880 --> 10:32.632
Foggy, you're not going down there.

10:35.760 --> 10:36.886
I have a life.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.306
I'm not prepared
to become a wanted fugitive.

10:40.389 --> 10:41.849
Wait, wait, wait. No, just wait.

10:42.683 --> 10:45.645
What if it's a trap
and you don't walk out again? Huh?

10:49.065 --> 10:50.483
Can you run that downstairs?

10:56.906 --> 10:58.115
Mr. Nelson.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.326
Special Agent Poindexter.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.912
You just won me 50 bucks.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.331
Some of the guys
were betting you wouldn't show.

11:05.414 --> 11:08.501
I'm always available to help the FBI,
Agent Poindexter.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.294
In fact...

11:12.797 --> 11:13.798
please smile. There.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.097
Posted to my campaign web page

11:21.180 --> 11:25.017
and the tens of thousands of
police officers that know that I'm here.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.228
With you. Helping.

11:27.311 --> 11:30.564
Relax, Mr. Nelson.
You're not in any danger.

11:30.648 --> 11:33.192
You'll be very useful
when you're the next district attorney.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.320
Why am I here?

11:37.697 --> 11:40.449
-'Cause Ray Nadeem was a friend of yours.
-A client.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.411
Sad, the way it all turned out.

11:43.994 --> 11:44.912
Even though he's dead,

11:44.995 --> 11:47.748
I can't answer any questions
that would violate privilege.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.125
I'm not asking you to.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.043
Follow me.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.804
Thank you for coming, Mr. Nelson.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.935
Mrs. Nadeem. What are you doing here?

12:09.019 --> 12:10.521
I came to apologize.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.357
To apologize?

12:13.441 --> 12:16.736
I asked them to call you,
because you were Ray's lawyer.

12:16.819 --> 12:20.614
And I want to fully cooperate
with the investigation of my husband.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.117
What Ray did is...

12:24.702 --> 12:27.121
How could a man I loved
with all my heart...

12:28.414 --> 12:32.334
the father of my son,
turn out to be such a monster?

12:32.835 --> 12:34.462
[Dex] It wasn't your fault, Seema.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.422
Ray fooled a lot of people.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.924
Nobody here blames you or Sami. You're still part of the FBI family.

12:41.969 --> 12:45.347
We'll give you the room.
Take all the time you need.

12:54.064 --> 12:55.191
Suck it up.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.276
I'm only doing this because I have to.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.364
-How's Sami?
-He's okay.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.033
With my sister.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.327
I haven't told him yet.

13:07.036 --> 13:10.748
-When did you get here?
-I came as soon as I saw the news.

13:12.458 --> 13:16.921
I didn't want to believe it,
but I know I needed to hear the truth.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.470
I'm so sorry. That...

13:25.721 --> 13:27.181
must have been an incredible shock.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.265
It was.

13:28.933 --> 13:34.897
But I decided it was the right thing
for me to come in and to cooperate.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.191
That was smart.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.485
Totally the right thing to do.

13:41.904 --> 13:46.742
I was hoping you could help me
figure out how I can help the FBI.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.746
And whether or not Ray's
life insurance policy will still pay.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.165
Otherwise, Sami and I
have nothing to live on.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.917
How will we survive?

14:04.176 --> 14:06.470
I'll help you figure it out, Mrs. Nadeem.

14:07.429 --> 14:10.808
Whatever I can do
to help you and Sami get through this.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.569
[cell phone vibrating]

14:24.780 --> 14:26.115
What do you want?

14:26.198 --> 14:29.493
[Matt over cell phone]
<i>I'm coming for you, Dex. And my suit.</i>

14:30.744 --> 14:31.745
Where's Felix?

14:32.162 --> 14:33.664
You'll find out soon enough.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.458
[Dex] <i>I've got some free time now.</i>
<i>Why don't we meet up?</i>

14:36.542 --> 14:37.626
I have a question.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.755
Did you enjoy the feeling you got
when you killed those birdies?

14:42.840 --> 14:44.216
<i>Is that why you're still killing?</i>

14:44.300 --> 14:45.509
Birdies?

14:45.593 --> 14:47.177
<i>The ones you killed with rocks.</i>

14:48.178 --> 14:49.930
<i>I bet it felt good at first, right?</i>

14:50.848 --> 14:52.933
Then it's never the same after that.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.354
What do you think Dr. Mercer would say
if she could see you now?

14:57.897 --> 14:58.939
Can you hang on a second?

14:59.023 --> 15:03.027
I need a tissue for all the tears
I'm crying over my shitty childhood.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.614
Have you heard
from your friend Julie lately?

15:07.197 --> 15:09.491
You wanna talk to Dr. Mercer, asshole?
Keep talking.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.536
What do you think she'd say if she knew
about the innocent people you killed?

15:14.121 --> 15:15.748
I bet she'd be disappointed, Dex.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.876
<i>If she were still alive.</i>

15:20.294 --> 15:21.211
If you...

15:22.588 --> 15:24.131
If you hurt Julie--

15:24.214 --> 15:26.842
<i>Fisk had her killed.</i>

15:28.302 --> 15:32.598
<i>He killed Julie, so he could replace her</i>
<i>as your North Star.</i>

15:36.101 --> 15:38.562
You should stick
to beating on people in alleys,

15:39.229 --> 15:41.273
because you're not
going to get in my head.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.900
<i>You don't have to believe me.</i>

15:42.983 --> 15:45.945
Then again, you may wanna ask
how I got Manning's phone.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.363
<i>Don't know. Don't care.</i>

15:48.197 --> 15:50.324
Julie wouldn't approve
of you killing people, Dex.

15:50.407 --> 15:53.077
Stop saying her name.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.079
<i>You said you got some free time?</i>

15:56.455 --> 15:58.832
You may wanna check out 16 Canal Place.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.292
<i>Why?</i>

16:05.255 --> 16:10.135
<i>If you're showing this to Sami,</i>
<i>I need you to stop the video now.</i>

16:13.681 --> 16:14.807
<i>For everyone else...</i>

16:14.890 --> 16:18.185
<i>My name is Special Agent Ray Nadeem</i>
<i>of the FBI,</i>

16:18.268 --> 16:19.520
<i>and under federal law,</i>

16:19.603 --> 16:23.190
<i>I swear that the testimony</i>
<i>I'm about to give is the truth,</i>

16:23.273 --> 16:26.110
<i>whole truth</i>
<i>and nothing but the truth...</i>

16:26.819 --> 16:29.113
<i>and should be considered</i>
<i>my dying declaration.</i>

16:29.989 --> 16:34.702
<i>I'm guilty of a number of criminal acts,</i>
<i>and I was in no way acting alone.</i>

16:35.285 --> 16:40.332
Wilson Fisk coerced me
and a number of fellow FBI agents

16:40.416 --> 16:43.168
into aiding and abetting
a criminal conspiracy...

16:44.044 --> 16:47.256
<i>to extort protection money</i>
<i>from New York crime organizations.</i>

16:47.339 --> 16:49.925
I gotta hand it to you, Fisk.
You know how to put on a show.

16:50.009 --> 16:56.265
<i>Agents Arinori, Johnson, Markham, Mockter,</i>
<i>O'Connor and Ramsey all took part</i>

16:56.348 --> 16:58.684
<i>and continue to act as Fisk's operatives</i>

16:58.767 --> 17:03.856
<i>under the orders of our boss,</i>
<i>Special Agent in Charge Tammy Hattley.</i>

17:04.898 --> 17:07.568
<i>There may be others. I can't be sure.</i>

17:07.651 --> 17:09.695
But I personally witnessed

17:09.778 --> 17:14.658
SAC Hattley murder Agent Winn
in her kitchen, using my handgun.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.785
-[gunshot]
-No!

17:16.869 --> 17:20.330
<i>And then witnessed Fisk's aide,</i>
<i>Felix Manning,</i>

17:20.414 --> 17:24.960
<i>remove the body and use this crime</i>
<i>and threats against my family</i>

17:25.044 --> 17:27.671
<i>to blackmail me</i>
<i>into cooperating with Fisk.</i>

17:28.255 --> 17:30.007
<i>I'm not making any excuses,</i>

17:30.090 --> 17:33.635
<i>because I aided and abetted</i>
<i>the worst crime of them all.</i> I personally drove
Special Agent Ben Poindexter

17:38.932 --> 17:43.353
to the Clinton Church...
dressed in a fake Daredevil suit.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.024
I knew at this point

17:47.107 --> 17:50.110
that Poindexter was the killer
who attacked the <i>Bulletin,</i>

17:50.652 --> 17:53.155
<i>and I knew he was going to do</i>
<i>something horrible at the church.</i>

17:53.739 --> 17:55.032
<i>But I let it happen anyway.</i>

17:59.411 --> 18:04.333
So I'm guilty of aiding and abetting
the murder of Father Paul Lantom.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.127
<i>I'm ashamed of what I've done.</i>

18:08.045 --> 18:10.005
<i>But that doesn't change the fact that I</i>

18:10.672 --> 18:13.592
and everyone I just named
are guilty as hell.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.220
Seems...

18:18.555 --> 18:20.474
<i>you need to get this video</i>
<i>to my attorneys.</i>

18:20.557 --> 18:22.351
<i>And don't try and run.</i>

18:22.976 --> 18:27.272
Go to the FBI and pretend like you
don't know anything about any of this.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.775
Tell them I'm a monster.

18:31.193 --> 18:34.113
[sobs] It's the only way that you and Sami
can get through this.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.865
<i>I'm sorry, baby.</i>

18:37.825 --> 18:39.451
I will always love you.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.204
[kisses]

18:46.708 --> 18:47.918
-[exhales]
-[Karen] God.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.506
He knew he was gonna die.

18:53.966 --> 18:57.010
Okay, so...
maybe it won't hold up in court.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.638
But if we put this out there,
it'll make Fisk's life a living hell.

19:00.222 --> 19:05.185
Actually, a dying declaration
is exempt from the hearsay rule.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.353
What?

19:06.436 --> 19:09.898
The court says that a person
who believes that they're dying is...

19:09.982 --> 19:11.567
has less incentive to lie.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.110
Therefore, anything they say is--

19:13.193 --> 19:15.195
You're telling me
this is admissible in court?

19:15.279 --> 19:16.989
Every damn word.

19:17.072 --> 19:18.907
It's the silver bullet to take down Fisk.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.160
Shit. The world has to know.

19:21.743 --> 19:23.203
The world and Matt.

19:45.642 --> 19:47.603
[door lock clanking]

20:59.758 --> 21:00.717
[Dex exclaims]

21:01.927 --> 21:03.303

21:06.014 --> 21:07.224
[Dex moaning]

21:09.184 --> 21:12.062
[breathing heavily and grunting]

21:22.406 --> 21:24.825
[cell phone vibrating]

21:34.960 --> 21:36.295
When I find you...

21:37.004 --> 21:40.841
[Matt over cell phone] <i>Like I said,</i>
<i>Fisk killed her and we both know it.</i>

21:40.924 --> 21:42.968
<i>-You did this.</i>
-Think, Dex.

21:44.177 --> 21:45.887
Who got Julie the job in the hotel?

21:46.596 --> 21:48.432
<i>Who had you followed</i>
<i>when you were stalking her?</i>

21:48.515 --> 21:50.475
<i>It was all Fisk.</i> You let him turn you into a murderer.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.023
You think he's gonna let
Julie get in the way?

21:58.191 --> 21:59.651
Why are you telling me this?

22:00.819 --> 22:02.904
'Cause Fisk wants to get married tonight.

22:04.072 --> 22:06.992
And I don't think he deserves
a life of happily ever after.

22:08.368 --> 22:09.911
[soft droning]

22:32.642 --> 22:34.269
[woman] Wonder what
the bride's gonna wear.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.479
[man] Ladies and gentlemen,

22:35.562 --> 22:39.566
please have your invitations in hand
as you go through the metal detector.

22:40.692 --> 22:42.361
Who does Fisk think he is?

22:43.028 --> 22:45.697
Summoning us here with no notice.

22:46.531 --> 22:48.408
Well, he's the only one who can.

22:48.492 --> 22:51.036
Well, he's really starting to piss me off.

22:51.119 --> 22:53.121
Oh, relax. Here, have some champagne.

22:54.164 --> 22:55.415
You'll live longer.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.920
-This is what we're running?
-[woman] Mmm-hmm.

23:04.549 --> 23:07.719
Well, it's official. Yesterday sucked.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.097
Yes, it did.

23:10.180 --> 23:13.058
But today is gonna make it all worth it.

23:13.141 --> 23:14.684
-What's this?
-Look.

Hey there, Lim.

23:42.337 --> 23:43.338
Dex?

23:45.549 --> 23:49.094
That's Agent Lim.
He's one of the good ones.

23:49.177 --> 23:51.513
-What in the hell--
-Do yourself a favor.

23:52.472 --> 23:54.516
Walk away.

Wilson? Wilson?

24:18.623 --> 24:19.499
I...

24:21.251 --> 24:22.419
Repeat the question.

24:22.502 --> 24:23.837
[crowd chuckling]

24:24.629 --> 24:25.630
[cardinal] Do you? I do.

24:30.218 --> 24:32.179
-[cardinal] And you?
-I do.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.723
Then you may.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.148
[crowd cheering]

25:06.046 --> 25:09.174
[announcer] ...we are so glad you could
come and celebrate with us tonight.

25:09.257 --> 25:13.386
It is my honor and privilege
to present to you for the first time...

25:14.304 --> 25:17.057
Mr. and Mrs. Wilson Fisk.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.649
-Hi.
-Beautiful ceremony, Vanessa.

25:25.732 --> 25:26.942
Thank you for coming.

25:31.821 --> 25:32.864
That was a bold move

25:32.948 --> 25:35.742
to sit me next to the prosecutor
who tried to send me away.

25:36.409 --> 25:38.161
I told him to hold my purse.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.580
That must have been
very satisfying for you.

25:40.664 --> 25:43.667
It was. My tax dollars at work.

25:44.459 --> 25:45.835
You never disappoint.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.004
[announcer] And now, ladies and gentlemen,

25:48.088 --> 25:52.384
we'd like to invite the bride and groom
to the floor for the first dance.

25:52.467 --> 25:53.718
I believe that's our cue.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.843
so grab your dance partner
and head to the floor.

27:18.928 --> 27:21.014
You'll handle it, Wilson.

27:21.556 --> 27:25.185
Like you handle everything.
Show them that none of it matters.

Repeat, agents down.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.913
-How did this happen?
-Dex knows our security protocols.

28:28.915 --> 28:31.543
That video of Agent Nadeem
is a threat to us.

28:31.626 --> 28:34.921
I'll discredit his testimony
and take care of everything.

28:35.004 --> 28:36.214
-I will handle it.
-Wilson.

28:36.297 --> 28:38.466
I should have never let Dex
get that close to you.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.468
Be angry later. Be smart now.

28:41.010 --> 28:42.053
Listen to me.

28:46.015 --> 28:47.350
We need to run.

28:49.185 --> 28:51.563
You didn't make a mistake marrying me.

28:51.646 --> 28:54.107
I know that. But now, be smart.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.067
For both of us.

Find and stop Daredevil.

29:46.326 --> 29:49.120
The rest of you,
we don't know which FBI agents

29:49.204 --> 29:51.581

-Sure hope this wasn't Matt.

-So nobody stops me.

30:26.449 --> 30:27.659

Stop it, please!

34:11.132 --> 34:14.552

34:17.805 --> 34:22.393
I will never stop hunting Karen Page
or Foggy Nelson.

Vanessa, please go. Please!

34:33.112 --> 34:35.156
[grunting] You...

34:35.239 --> 34:36.949
You want me to kill you.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.868
No prison can keep me.

34:39.452 --> 34:40.328
You know that.

34:40.828 --> 34:43.581
-Come on, kill me!
-[Matt] No!

34:43.664 --> 34:47.877
God knows I want to,
but you don't get to destroy who I am.

34:48.461 --> 34:49.921
You will go back to prison,

34:50.004 --> 34:53.549
and you will live the rest
of your miserable life in a cage,

34:53.633 --> 34:56.385
knowing you'll never have Vanessa,

34:56.469 --> 34:59.263
that this city rejected you.

34:59.347 --> 35:00.598
It beat you.

35:00.681 --> 35:03.142
I beat you!

35:08.773 --> 35:10.274
You'll keep my secret,

35:11.275 --> 35:14.821

or Foggy Nelson

35:14.904 --> 35:16.155

[Fisk snarls softly]

35:23.704 --> 35:27.834

the murder of Agent Ray Nadeem,

and like her husband,

35:30.169 --> 35:32.839
she'll spend the rest of her life
in a cell.

35:39.554 --> 35:42.306
I failed you. I failed you.

35:42.390 --> 35:43.474
No.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.601
[Fisk] Everything that I tried
to build for us...

35:49.355 --> 35:50.356
Vanessa...

35:53.359 --> 35:55.778
today was the happiest day of my life.

36:07.039 --> 36:08.499
All I wanted was you.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.169
Please.

36:24.557 --> 36:28.311
If I agree to your demands, then...

36:29.854 --> 36:31.731
you leave my wife alone.

36:33.399 --> 36:34.901
You leave Vanessa free!

36:41.407 --> 36:42.950
If you keep your word.

36:49.957 --> 36:51.417
Then, it's a deal.

36:56.339 --> 36:57.465
[banging on door]

37:04.180 --> 37:05.806
[officers yelling indistinctly]

37:18.444 --> 37:21.697
Wilson Fisk, you are under arrest.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.911
[Dex] I can't move.

37:28.204 --> 37:29.538
He isn't the real Daredevil.

37:30.164 --> 37:31.332
[officer] How do you know?

37:31.999 --> 37:33.292
Because he is.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.467
[indistinct chatter]

37:53.813 --> 37:55.731
-He's alive.
-[Karen sighs]

37:56.983 --> 37:58.025
Thank God.

38:08.661 --> 38:11.163
Please, give me a moment
to say goodbye to my wife.

38:12.081 --> 38:14.166
-Did you give one to Ray Nadeem?
-[Fisk] Please.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.796
[screaming]

38:19.380 --> 38:20.423
Please!

38:32.893 --> 38:34.312
Matt should be here.

38:36.939 --> 38:38.524
Well, I'm pretty sure he is.

39:28.491 --> 39:30.993
Last time we spoke,
I confronted Father Lantom.

39:33.162 --> 39:34.246
I was angry.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.166
I'd change that if I could.

39:37.875 --> 39:40.753
If God allowed that, there'd be no future.

39:41.545 --> 39:44.799
-Just people endlessly rewriting the past.
-Yeah.

39:46.967 --> 39:49.387
I think he was trying to tell me that
for a long time.

39:52.264 --> 39:55.559
His last words were, "Forgive us."

39:59.480 --> 40:01.148
Do you think that's possible?

40:10.241 --> 40:14.495
He told me something, years ago,
when this happened, that I never forgot.

40:16.705 --> 40:21.419
See, I was pretty angry at God
and bitter towards his world.

40:23.129 --> 40:26.215
How could a loving God blind me?

40:28.592 --> 40:29.593
Why?

40:30.594 --> 40:36.308
Anyway, he told me...
God's plan is like a beautiful tapestry.

40:37.184 --> 40:41.021
And the tragedy of being human is
that we only get to see it from the back.

40:42.523 --> 40:45.526
With all the ragged threads
and the muddy colors.

40:45.609 --> 40:49.447
And we only get a hint at the true beauty

40:49.530 --> 40:53.534
that would be revealed if we could see
the whole pattern on the other side...

40:55.202 --> 40:56.495
as God does.

41:00.374 --> 41:02.960
Anyway, I've been thinking
a lot about it recently, 'cause...

41:03.669 --> 41:05.588
I realize I've made some bad choices

41:05.671 --> 41:08.674
and hurt people
that I love without meaning to.

41:08.757 --> 41:11.302
You don't always know
when you start down a false path.

41:11.385 --> 41:13.971
No, you don't. And that's my point.

41:15.431 --> 41:18.184
I realize that if my life
had turned out any differently,

41:18.267 --> 41:20.186
that I would never have become Daredevil.

41:21.479 --> 41:24.523
And although people have died on my watch,
people who shouldn't have,

41:25.191 --> 41:26.984
there are countless others
that have lived.

41:31.155 --> 41:35.117
So, maybe it is all part of God's plan.

41:38.704 --> 41:41.707
Maybe my life
has been exactly as it had to be.

41:46.420 --> 41:48.380
You have a generous heart, Matthew.

41:48.464 --> 41:49.632
[Matt chuckles softly]

41:50.591 --> 41:52.510
To see the good in so much pain.

41:53.469 --> 41:54.637
Not always.

41:58.265 --> 42:00.809
In fact, Father Lantom
used to help me with that.

42:02.603 --> 42:05.439
Help me see the errors of my ways.

42:09.109 --> 42:12.154
I could use someone else
to help me with that now...

42:14.490 --> 42:15.741
once in a while.

42:19.828 --> 42:21.288
I'm a nun, Matthew.

42:23.958 --> 42:26.210
Helping is what I was called to do.

42:30.965 --> 42:33.259
[breathes deeply]

43:12.381 --> 43:14.800
Feels like half of Hell's Kitchen
is here today

43:15.843 --> 43:18.178
to say goodbye to Father Paul Lantom.

43:19.597 --> 43:20.639
Seems fair.

43:21.849 --> 43:24.852
He certainly welcomed everyone here,
Catholic or not.

43:26.312 --> 43:28.355
And he expected those of us who were

43:28.439 --> 43:31.984
to, uh, look for ways to do good
in our community.

43:33.569 --> 43:35.613
Not even the kids
got out of that requirement.

43:36.155 --> 43:39.158
I'm sure I'm not the only one
who remembers his "suggestion"

43:39.241 --> 43:43.537
that we give some of our
First Communion money to the poor box.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.664
-[crowd chuckling]
-[Matt] And that was his way.

43:46.874 --> 43:50.878
To think of the community,
and the, uh... and the individuals in it.

43:52.630 --> 43:54.632
To think in terms of, "What can I give?"

43:55.174 --> 43:58.927
He gave his life, right here
in this church, protecting others.

44:00.721 --> 44:02.973
Standing up to a man who used fear

44:03.057 --> 44:05.434
as a tool to set neighbors
against one another.

44:06.935 --> 44:09.980
If Father Lantom had an enemy,
I would say it was fear.

44:12.858 --> 44:16.320
For me, personally, he spent many years
trying to get me to face my own fears.

44:17.112 --> 44:18.864
To understand how they enslaved me,

44:18.947 --> 44:21.867
how they divided me
from the people that I love.

44:22.785 --> 44:24.745
He counseled me to transcend my fears,

44:26.038 --> 44:27.706
to be brave enough to forgive...

44:29.500 --> 44:32.670
and see the possibilities
of being a man without fear.

44:34.546 --> 44:35.798
That was his legacy.

44:38.926 --> 44:41.762
And now it's up to all of us
to, uh, live up to it.

44:45.140 --> 44:47.142
[indistinct chatter]

44:50.479 --> 44:51.438
[Matt sighs]

44:54.775 --> 44:57.444
That was nice, what you said.

44:58.946 --> 45:01.323
[Matt] Yeah, it wasn't just him, you know.

45:03.117 --> 45:04.243
It was you, too.

45:06.078 --> 45:08.455
You helped me see the truth about myself.

45:11.041 --> 45:13.043
Ouch. That had to hurt.

45:13.127 --> 45:14.086
[chuckles]

45:15.003 --> 45:17.464
Well, maybe one of these days,
I'll forgive you, too.

45:17.548 --> 45:18.382
[Karen chuckles]

45:19.425 --> 45:21.218
Before my funeral, I hope.

45:23.053 --> 45:24.722
I'm glad you told me, Karen.

45:26.306 --> 45:28.684
About Wesley and your brother.

45:30.269 --> 45:31.270
Yeah. Well, uh...

45:34.606 --> 45:36.525
I couldn't live with that lie forever.

45:37.735 --> 45:40.154
We're all just trying to do
more good than harm.

45:41.071 --> 45:43.115
And I'd say you're ahead on that score.

45:51.665 --> 45:54.793
I was starting to like the idea
of being married to the DA.

45:55.961 --> 45:57.880
Pretty sure Blake Tower's not married.

45:58.297 --> 46:00.215
Yeah, he'll have to get by without me.

46:01.425 --> 46:03.260
You, on the other hand, are in luck.

46:03.635 --> 46:05.763
The firm will be thrilled
to have you back.

46:06.805 --> 46:08.557
The thing is, Marci...

46:09.475 --> 46:11.143
I'm not sure I want that anymore.

46:12.603 --> 46:15.105
I was afraid you were going to say
something like that.

46:16.648 --> 46:17.733
You're not mad?

46:19.151 --> 46:20.486
We'll talk about it later.

46:21.028 --> 46:23.864
But do I really have to watch you
drive your campaign off a cliff?

46:24.281 --> 46:26.241
Nah. I got that part covered.

46:26.325 --> 46:28.410
...that Wilson Fisk is a malignant tumor.

46:28.952 --> 46:31.747
Well, the State of New York
isn't going to make the same mistake.

46:31.830 --> 46:36.168
Everyone knows his game now.
Fisk won't manipulate the system again.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.213
Excuse me, Mr. Tower.

46:39.755 --> 46:40.798
[Tower] Mr. Nelson.

46:43.967 --> 46:45.886
I wanted you to be the first to hear

46:45.969 --> 46:49.181
that I'm officially dropping out
of the race for district attorney.

46:50.849 --> 46:54.144
The way you stood up to Wilson Fisk
was an inspiration to us all.

46:55.145 --> 46:56.814
I'm gonna be voting for you.

46:56.897 --> 46:59.358
Thank you. [chuckles]

47:03.821 --> 47:06.615
-Hey there, Matty!
-[Matt] Uncle Timmy.

47:06.698 --> 47:09.743
-How are those briefs doing?
-Still stapled together.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.286
[laughs] Attaboy.

47:12.538 --> 47:15.833
Of course, we're gonna
have to buy sunscreen by the bucket.

47:16.375 --> 47:17.793
Better than that rock salt.

47:17.876 --> 47:20.754
Enough with the snow and ice.
We're getting out of here.

47:20.838 --> 47:22.840
I can't believe you're finally doing it.

47:22.923 --> 47:27.386
Guess I'll have to get used to the idea
of Christmas in Tampa. Yikes!

47:27.469 --> 47:29.888
Like I'd miss the grandkids at Christmas.

47:29.972 --> 47:31.640
-Speaking of which...
-Hold that thought.

47:31.723 --> 47:33.559
I need to talk to Theo for a minute.

47:36.645 --> 47:39.606
-You know she ain't giving up.
-You don't have to, either.

47:40.232 --> 47:42.776
Me? I don't even have a girlfriend.

47:42.860 --> 47:46.321
I mean on this place.
Tower's taking down Red Lion Bank.

47:46.947 --> 47:48.031
You talked to him?

47:48.699 --> 47:52.369
He's not going to prosecute a sweet
old couple who got screwed by Fisk.

47:53.579 --> 47:54.746
You, though...

47:55.497 --> 47:56.874
What about me?

47:56.957 --> 47:58.333
If you pay back the loan...

47:59.668 --> 48:01.253
they won't file criminal charges.

48:01.336 --> 48:02.504
[Theo exhales and chuckles]

48:02.588 --> 48:06.675
That's some fancy lawyering, Foggy.
You're really saving my ass.

48:07.259 --> 48:10.178
Eh. Who wanted to be DA anyway?

48:10.262 --> 48:11.847
You're too good-looking for that job.

48:11.930 --> 48:12.764
Ow!

48:13.307 --> 48:14.725
So, what are you gonna do now?

48:15.392 --> 48:16.518
Drink these.

48:17.269 --> 48:18.270
Good plan.

48:20.772 --> 48:22.024
Is that a whiskey neat?

48:23.817 --> 48:25.903
-For medicinal purposes.
-[Karen] Mmm-hmm.

48:27.821 --> 48:29.323
You want me to get you your own?

48:30.073 --> 48:32.200
-Oh, this one tastes fine.
-[Matt chuckles]

48:32.284 --> 48:34.494
-Give Matt his drink back.
-Yes.

48:36.705 --> 48:41.168
So, I guess you guys heard,
Special Agent in Charge Hattley flipped.

48:41.710 --> 48:44.588
-She corroborated Ray's dying declaration.
-I did hear.

48:44.671 --> 48:45.505
[Karen] Hmm.

48:46.298 --> 48:49.968
So, the FBI is getting an enema,
and Fisk is...

48:50.928 --> 48:54.139
-still breathing.
-Yep. Still breathing.

48:54.681 --> 48:56.975
Headed to prison. Again.

48:57.059 --> 48:59.186
Not exactly what I had in mind.

49:00.479 --> 49:02.189
You trust that he'll keep his word?

49:02.814 --> 49:04.983
I mean, I trust that he loves Vanessa.

49:05.776 --> 49:08.654
Long as she's free, he should stay away.

49:08.737 --> 49:12.366
-And if she gets hit by a bus tomorrow?
-Yeah. Well, then we'll cross that bridge.

49:14.368 --> 49:17.621
So, how long you gonna stick around?

49:19.247 --> 49:23.126
Actually, I was thinking
about moving back into my apartment.

49:23.210 --> 49:24.211
Really?

49:24.294 --> 49:26.880
Well, seeing as the bills are paid,
I might as well.

49:26.964 --> 49:29.716
[chuckles] Okay, so hold on.
You're going to move

49:29.800 --> 49:33.136
-back into Matt Murdock's apartment?
-[Matt] Yeah, yeah.

49:33.679 --> 49:36.390
I just figured he has
a healthier life-work balance.

49:36.473 --> 49:37.641
[Karen] Hmm?

49:37.724 --> 49:40.435
And... actual friends.

49:40.519 --> 49:43.605
Doesn't have a job, though.
He's kind of a mooch.

49:44.398 --> 49:45.857
Semi-decent lawyer, though.

49:45.941 --> 49:47.943
Ooh... "Semi-decent"? Ouch.

49:48.026 --> 49:51.196
[chuckles] You do break the law.
A lot. And often.

49:51.279 --> 49:54.116
Objection. Sustained.

49:55.826 --> 49:59.121
I have a crazy idea. I need a new napkin.

50:04.167 --> 50:08.880
-Okay. Well, he's writing something.
-Apparently.

50:15.262 --> 50:16.263
[Matt] What?

50:18.015 --> 50:21.351
Oh, he just wrote
all of our names, didn't he?

50:21.435 --> 50:22.936
How can you know that?

50:23.020 --> 50:26.356
-'Cause I was thinking the same thing.
-Okay. Okay, guys, I'm not a lawyer.

50:27.441 --> 50:29.109
You're one hell of an investigator.

50:29.192 --> 50:31.737
Yeah, and way more stable
than Jessica Jones.

50:31.820 --> 50:33.947
[all chuckling]

50:34.031 --> 50:35.615
All right, so what? What does that mean?

50:35.699 --> 50:38.452
We go back to helping people
out of a crappy office,

50:38.535 --> 50:39.953
getting paid in chickens?

50:40.912 --> 50:43.040
I think Theo would let us
work out of here, to start.

50:43.123 --> 50:45.333
At least we'd have a place
to sell the chickens.

50:45.417 --> 50:46.668
[chuckles]

50:47.961 --> 50:49.629
-So what do you think?
-[Karen sighs]

50:52.799 --> 50:54.176
Why the hell not?

50:55.635 --> 50:57.637
To Nelson, Murdock &amp; Page.

50:58.388 --> 51:01.058
-Page, Murdock &amp; Nelson.
-Hang on a minute.

51:01.141 --> 51:02.726
That actually has a nice ring to it.

51:13.862 --> 51:16.573
[surgeon] Doctor, if this fails,
he'll be permanently paralyzed.

51:19.117 --> 51:20.869
T8 and T9 are falling apart.

51:21.495 --> 51:24.873
Even using cadaver material,
reconstruction is hopeless.

51:25.999 --> 51:27.125
[doctor] I disagree.

51:28.585 --> 51:31.296
The Cogmium steel
reinforcing framework is--

51:31.379 --> 51:34.216
[surgeon] Can't replace
pulverized vertebrae, Dr. Oyama.

51:34.966 --> 51:36.718
[Oyama] The patient knew the risks.

51:37.302 --> 51:38.303
We continue.
