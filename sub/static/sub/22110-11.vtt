the grocery store.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.758
Okay, you remember
Memento? That.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.193
Don't forget
the cucumbers, Peter.

00:43.227 --> 00:44.894
All right. Where's that?

00:44.928 --> 00:47.264
Oh, hey, right, 'cause of
that thing we started doing.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.866
By the way, speaking of
which, best "O" ever.

00:49.899 --> 00:51.901
I felt dirty for an hour,
but it's gone now.

01:21.097 --> 01:23.300
All right, let's
get (bleep) high.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.135
You can't be high
for this, Brian.

01:25.169 --> 01:26.403
This is serious stuff.

01:26.436 --> 01:28.305
This is a 14-hour meditation

01:28.338 --> 01:30.907

of family, fast cars,

01:30.940 --> 01:34.144
product placement,
racial ambiguity and family.

01:34.178 --> 01:36.480
Where's eight? Didn't
that one just come out?

01:36.513 --> 01:38.648
Someone said they were
going to get me eight

01:38.682 --> 01:40.150
on Blu-ray for my birthday,

01:40.184 --> 01:42.452
and someo got me
a limited edition

01:42.486 --> 01:45.155
Michael Kors pebbled leather
tote bag instead.

01:45.189 --> 01:47.257
You love that bag.
I know. You're the best.

01:47.291 --> 01:48.325
Okay, put in Fast 6.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.926
You're starting with six?

01:49.959 --> 01:52.596
Um, yeah. We're going in order
from best to worst.

01:52.629 --> 01:55.365
Six, five, seven, three--
I know that's controversial--

01:55.399 --> 01:56.966
one, four, two.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.202
By the way, don't tell Rupert

01:58.235 --> 02:00.170
about Paul Walker being D-E-A-D.

02:00.204 --> 02:02.071
He doesn't know.

02:03.640 --> 02:04.974
All right. So, what's the plot?

02:05.008 --> 02:08.111
Oh, you don't understand
these movies.

02:08.144 --> 02:10.214
(tires squealing over TV)

02:10.247 --> 02:11.681
What was that, Rupert?

02:11.715 --> 02:13.717
Oh, yes.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.319
Yes.

02:15.352 --> 02:17.120
No.

02:17.153 --> 02:19.956
I don't know. Maybe? Maybe bi?

02:19.989 --> 02:22.226
That's Ludacris.
That's not Tyrese.

02:22.259 --> 02:24.328
What are you talking about?
They look nothing alike.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.029
Ludacris looks
like a human peanut,

02:26.062 --> 02:27.331
and Tyrese looks slick.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.199
He looks like a Chinese black.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.201
Like Africa and Asia had sex

02:31.235 --> 02:32.536
while Europe sat on a chair

02:32.569 --> 02:34.404
in the corner of the hotel room
and watched.

02:34.438 --> 02:37.207
Ludacris, human peanut.
Tyrese, Chinese black.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.175
Are you gonna keep talking like
this during the whole thing?

02:39.209 --> 02:40.544
What? I'm answering
Rupert's questions.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.178
Now we're gonna have to rewind.

02:42.212 --> 02:44.814
We just missed the scene where
half the team steals a tank

02:44.848 --> 02:47.050
while the other half pretends
to be a DJ for some reason.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.385
Damn it.
Yeah, okay.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.220
I'm going to the bar.
Suit yourself.

02:50.254 --> 02:53.156
Rupert and I
are just fine without you.
(door closes)

02:53.189 --> 02:54.658
(laughs) You're right.

02:54.691 --> 02:56.092
I bet he is on his period.
