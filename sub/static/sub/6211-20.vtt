Well, since cousin Amanda's
visiting for the weekend,

00:03.629 --> 00:06.121
I thought I'd get her a little present.

00:07.382 --> 00:09.127
That's a thoughtful gift for all of us.

00:09.301 --> 00:11.176
Now, now, she's family.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.923
We should welcome her
with open arms.

If she tries anything, we have
an electric cage in the basement.

She's back.

Hi, everybody.
It's so good to see you.

Sabrina,
I don't blame you for being suspicious.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.736
My behaviour in past
may have been a little bratty.

00:36.912 --> 00:38.158
Yeah, you were a little bratty

00:38.330 --> 00:40.371
and Nazi Germany
was a little aggressive.

But I've grown up.

just like you.

she does seem more mature.

you have to scrub all the pots.

you wanna help me dust the clocks?

the fine print on that desire spell.

to throw her in the river.

why did you have to come in here?

Why couldn't you
just leave me alone?

about the plough I bought.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.423
Well, this is a conundrum, isn't it?

And why is it that our entire lives,

in my own room, tree house, pod,

17:46.316 --> 17:48.061
there you were? Why is that?

17:48.902 --> 17:50.528
Well, the only thing I can think of

17:50.696 --> 17:53.270
is that, a lot of the time
there's just the two of us,

17:53.448 --> 17:56.450
so that if you're alone,
that means I'm alone.

17:56.618 --> 17:59.537
And when I'm alone, I get lonely.

17:59.705 --> 18:01.414

not to be alone.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.034

18:41.205 --> 18:44.788
Well, hiring a hit man
is prohibitively expensive.

So I guess you could just wait for her
to outgrow this crush on Harvey.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.623
