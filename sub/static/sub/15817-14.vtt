02:30.451 --> 02:31.252
THEN COME BACK FOR THE FIGHT.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.365
IF THIS FAMILY IS WHAT YOU WANT,

02:44.365 --> 02:45.433
YOU FIGHT FOR IT.

02:45.433 --> 02:47.535
I'M TRYING TO MEND THINGS UP,

02:47.535 --> 02:48.969
LET RASHEEDA KNOW I LOVE HER.

02:48.969 --> 02:49.837
I WANT TO STAY HERE.

02:49.837 --> 02:50.671
I WANT TO BE HERE.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.639
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

02:51.639 --> 02:52.440
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO?

02:52.440 --> 02:53.574
I MADE A MISTAKE.

02:53.574 --> 02:54.442
I'M ADMITTING IT.

02:54.442 --> 02:55.142

02:58.712 --> 03:00.080
BUT SHE'S YELLING, SCREAMING,

03:00.080 --> 03:01.349
ARGUING, TRYING TO HIT.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.516
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S WORTH

03:02.516 --> 03:04.518
IT ANYMORE.

03:12.025 --> 03:12.926
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON WITH

03:12.926 --> 03:14.795
YOU, MA?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.964
GIRL, A LOT.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.299
AFTER THE BLOWUP THE OTHER DAY

03:18.299 --> 03:19.267
AT SCRAPPY'S PARTY,

03:19.267 --> 03:20.634
I AM DONE.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.169
SCRAPPY NEEDS TO SIT MOMMA DEE'S

03:22.169 --> 03:24.171
CRAZY ASS DOWN ON HER THRONE

03:24.171 --> 03:25.373

03:25.373 --> 03:26.039

03:26.039 --> 03:27.341
'CAUSE THERE'S NO WAY

03:27.341 --> 03:29.009
I'M GONNA LET MY DAUGHTER EMANI

03:29.009 --> 03:30.177
GO ANYWHERE NEAR THIS

03:30.177 --> 03:31.779
RATCHET-ASS BITCH.

03:31.779 --> 03:32.446
WE AT WAR.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.314
WE NOT TALKIN'.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.115
AND IF HE DOES GO TO JAIL AGAIN,

03:35.115 --> 03:36.116
I'M NOT THERE TO SUPPORT.

03:36.116 --> 03:37.585
I'M NOT THERE TO DO NOTHIN'.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.086
I KNOW I'VE SAID I WAS DONE

03:39.086 --> 03:40.354
BEFORE, BUT WHEN YOU GOT A CHILD

03:40.354 --> 03:42.856
INVOLVED--

03:42.856 --> 03:43.891
I'M JUST SAYING.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.293
ERICA'S NOT GONNA LET HERSELF

03:45.293 --> 03:46.026
GET PUSHED AROUND,

03:46.026 --> 03:47.628
AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE HER.

03:47.628 --> 03:48.962
BUT ERICA'S REALLY GONNA HAVE

03:48.962 --> 03:50.598
TO STOP AND THINK ABOUT EMANI.

03:50.598 --> 03:51.965
I MEAN, SOMETIMES I WANT TO CUT

03:51.965 --> 03:53.567
STEVIE OFF COMPLETELY.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.735
I CAN'T DO THAT.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.304
I HAVE EVA, AND I HAVE TO THINK

03:56.304 --> 03:57.705
ABOUT HER AND HER DAD,

03:57.705 --> 03:59.307
AND WE HAVE TO CO-PARENT.

03:59.307 --> 04:00.140
I GOT STEVIE,

04:00.140 --> 04:02.075
WHO SAYS HE'S BEING DECENT

04:02.075 --> 04:02.976
BY GIVING ME MONEY,

04:02.976 --> 04:04.345
BUT THEN WHEN HE GIVES ME MONEY

04:04.345 --> 04:05.446
FOR EVA, THERE'S STRINGS

04:05.446 --> 04:06.747
ATTACHED.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.615
RIGHT.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.216
I HAVE TO SLEEP WITH YOU?

04:09.216 --> 04:09.917
REALLY?

04:09.917 --> 04:10.918
I DON'T WANT IT THEN.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.053
YEAH, HE GAVE ME A CAR

04:13.053 --> 04:14.888
AND SAID IT WAS FOR EVA AND I,

04:14.888 --> 04:17.625
BUT THEN WAS HARASSING ME TO...

04:17.625 --> 04:19.126
YOU KNOW WHAT.

04:19.126 --> 04:19.793
[sighs]

04:19.793 --> 04:20.461
CALLING ME UP,

04:20.461 --> 04:21.128
"CAN I GET THIS?

04:21.128 --> 04:21.795
CAN I GET THAT?

04:21.795 --> 04:22.463
WELL, I GAVE YOU THIS,

04:22.463 --> 04:23.464
AND I GIVE YOU BLAH, BLAH,

04:23.464 --> 04:25.065
BLAH," BUT YOU CAN'T--

04:25.065 --> 04:26.400
YOU GOT A BITCH, RIGHT?

04:26.400 --> 04:27.067
RIGHT.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.068
GO CALL HER AND [bleep] HER

04:28.068 --> 04:28.736
NASTY ASS.

04:28.736 --> 04:29.737
WHAT YOU CALLING ME FOR?

04:29.737 --> 04:31.104
IF YOU'RE GIVING ME SOMETHING

04:31.104 --> 04:32.239
FOR OUR DAUGHTER,

04:32.239 --> 04:33.140
LET IT BE THAT.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.141
WHY CAN'T THEY BE RESPONSIBLE

04:34.141 --> 04:34.808
FOR THE KIDS?

04:34.808 --> 04:36.043
WHY DO THEY HAVE TO USE MONEY

04:36.043 --> 04:37.345
TO TRY TO, YOU KNOW, DANGLE IT

04:37.345 --> 04:38.111
AND HOLD POWER OVER US?

04:38.111 --> 04:38.946
THEY DANGLE THE CARROT.

04:38.946 --> 04:39.780
BECAUSE THEY--

04:39.780 --> 04:40.781
THAT'S THE POWER.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.882
THEY FEEL THAT'S THE POWER.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.417
"WELL, IF I GIVE HER MONEY..."

04:43.417 --> 04:44.084
RIGHT.

04:44.084 --> 04:44.852
"THEN I FEEL LIKE I CAN GET

04:44.852 --> 04:45.519
WHAT I WANT."

04:45.519 --> 04:46.354
"I CAN WEAN HER ON IN," BUT--

04:46.354 --> 04:47.020
RIGHT.

04:47.020 --> 04:47.688
NO.

04:47.688 --> 04:48.422
I THINK A WOMAN NEEDS TO

04:48.422 --> 04:49.790
REALIZE THAT SHE HAS THE POWER,

04:49.790 --> 04:51.158
AND SHE DOESN'T NEED A MAN

04:51.158 --> 04:52.192
TO GIVE IT TO HER.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.627
MY PLAN RIGHT NOW IS TO FOCUS

04:53.627 --> 04:54.795
ON WHAT MAKES ME STRONG

04:54.795 --> 04:56.564
AND WHAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

04:56.564 --> 04:57.698
SO I'M GONNA GET MY MOMMY

04:57.698 --> 04:58.366
MAKEOVER.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.667
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN--HAD EVA.

04:59.667 --> 05:00.901
I'VE BEEN NURSING FOR THREE

05:00.901 --> 05:02.035
YEARS.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.203
OOH, YES.

05:03.203 --> 05:03.871
THAT'S A LOT.

05:03.871 --> 05:04.872
GIRL, I NEED TO GET

05:04.872 --> 05:05.539
MY BOOBS BACK.

05:05.539 --> 05:06.206
OH, I KNOW.

05:06.206 --> 05:07.040
I DID IT FOR NINE MONTHS,

05:07.040 --> 05:08.041
AND I KNOW HOW IT CAN GET.

05:08.041 --> 05:08.709
YOU KNOW...

05:08.709 --> 05:09.377
GIRL.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.077
YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR,

05:10.077 --> 05:10.744
YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, NO."

05:10.744 --> 05:11.745
I WANT TO LOOK LIKE THIS

05:11.745 --> 05:12.413
WITHOUT THE BRA.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.414
SO YOU WANT 'EM TO JUST...

05:13.414 --> 05:14.247
I WANT 'EM UP THERE.

05:14.247 --> 05:14.915
STAY UP.

05:14.915 --> 05:15.583

05:15.583 --> 05:16.283
OKAY, I'M THERE, GIRL.

05:16.283 --> 05:16.950

05:16.950 --> 05:17.718

05:17.718 --> 05:18.386

05:18.386 --> 05:19.052
OKAY.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.053
IF YOU CAN'T FIX SOMEONE

05:20.053 --> 05:21.655
ELSE, HOW ABOUT WE FIX OURSELF?

05:21.655 --> 05:22.390

05:22.990 --> 05:24.224
AND LET ME BE WHO I AM.

05:24.224 --> 05:24.892
AMEN.

05:24.892 --> 05:25.559

05:33.767 --> 05:34.768

05:37.137 --> 05:37.871
WITH THE ROCKS AND YOUR

05:37.871 --> 05:38.539
HEELS.

05:38.539 --> 05:39.540
LET ME HELP YOU OUT.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.541
HOW YOU DOING?

05:40.541 --> 05:41.208
GOOD.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.576
SO I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT

05:42.576 --> 05:43.577
ABOUT WHERE STEVIE AND I

05:43.577 --> 05:45.012
ARE GOING WITH THE PERSONAL

05:45.012 --> 05:46.246
AND THE BUSINESS.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.615
SO ONE OF US GOT TO START

05:47.615 --> 05:48.549
MAKING THE MOVES,

05:48.549 --> 05:50.217
SO I THOUGHT I'D SET UP A DINNER

05:50.217 --> 05:51.785
DATE WITH STEVIE SO I COULD GIVE

05:51.785 --> 05:52.853
HIM A LITTLE SURPRISE.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.889
I'VE BEEN SAVING FOR SOMETHING

05:55.889 --> 05:58.959
THAT...

05:58.959 --> 05:59.793
WHAT?

05:59.793 --> 06:00.528
I JUST--

06:00.528 --> 06:01.194
I'M LISTENING.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.996
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.

06:02.996 --> 06:03.664
OKAY.

06:03.664 --> 06:04.498
FOR EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE

06:04.498 --> 06:05.733
BUILDING AND DOING,

06:05.733 --> 06:09.302
AND...

06:09.302 --> 06:11.304
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.442
WHAT?

06:14.442 --> 06:15.443
STOP LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.309
WHY YOU LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?

06:16.309 --> 06:17.144
I WON'T EVEN LOOK.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.345
I'M WONDERING WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT

06:18.345 --> 06:20.347
TO PULL OUT YOUR BAG.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.584
WHAT THE [bleep]?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.586
ATLANTA TO PUERTO RICO?

06:25.586 --> 06:26.253
WHAT ARE WE GOING

06:26.253 --> 06:27.087
TO PUERTO RICO FOR?

06:27.087 --> 06:27.988
WE'RE GOING TO PUERTO RICO

06:27.988 --> 06:29.222
TO SHOOT THE VIDEO.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.024
SO WHAT IS THIS MONEY FOR?

06:31.024 --> 06:32.593
THAT'S FOR HALF OF THE VIDEO.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.694
MY HALF.

06:33.694 --> 06:34.595
STEVIE AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING

06:34.595 --> 06:35.463
ABOUT THE IDEA,

06:35.463 --> 06:36.830
ABOUT DOING THIS MUSIC VIDEO,

06:36.830 --> 06:37.665
AND TO BE HONEST,

06:37.665 --> 06:39.032
IT'S NOW OR NEVER.

06:39.032 --> 06:39.900
NOW THAT WE'RE GOING

06:39.900 --> 06:41.101
THE INDEPENDENT ROUTE,

06:41.101 --> 06:42.269
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR ME

06:42.269 --> 06:42.970
TO PUSH IT.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.638
IT'S TIME TO SPEND THAT BREAD,

06:44.638 --> 06:45.939
AND LET'S GET IT POPPIN'.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.476
ALL I NEED HIM IS TO SAY, "YES."

06:48.476 --> 06:49.376
WELL, THIS TICKET'S SAYING

06:49.376 --> 06:50.043
TWO DAYS.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.111
YOU READY THAT SOON?

06:51.111 --> 06:52.245
I'VE BEEN GETTING PREPARED.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.781
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT MY OUTFITS

06:53.781 --> 06:54.548
FOR THE VIDEO.

06:54.548 --> 06:55.315
I GOT MY HAIR FOR THE VIDEO.

06:55.315 --> 06:56.484
THIS--THIS TICKET LEAVES

06:56.484 --> 06:57.685
EARLY IN THE MORNING.

06:57.685 --> 06:58.952
YES.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.053
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS COME.

07:00.053 --> 07:00.854
I'M THE ONE THAT SHOULD BE

07:00.854 --> 07:01.955
WORRYING ABOUT EVERYTHING.

07:01.955 --> 07:02.790
SEE, TWO DAYS,

07:02.790 --> 07:03.991
IT'S NOT A LOT OF TIME.

07:03.991 --> 07:04.825
BUT I GOT MY CONNECTS

07:04.825 --> 07:06.126
IN PUERTO RICO,

07:06.126 --> 07:07.260
SO WE COULD DEFINITELY MAKE

07:07.260 --> 07:09.196
A VIDEO FAST AND CHEAP,

07:09.196 --> 07:10.063
BUT AFTER WE PUT THIS VIDEO

07:10.063 --> 07:10.998
IN THE CAN,

07:10.998 --> 07:12.733
I NEED THE CHAMPAGNE.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.267
I NEED THE MAGNUMS.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.168
AND I NEED TO BRING THE BEST

07:15.168 --> 07:17.237
THING EVER: MYSELF.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.872
YOU BROUGHT YOUR HALF.

07:18.872 --> 07:19.973
I GOT MY HALF.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.709
AND IF THIS IS WHAT YOU BROUGHT,

07:21.709 --> 07:24.044
THE VIDEO IS GONNA BE AMAZING.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.045
HIGH QUALITY.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.379
ONLY HIGH QUALITY FOR

07:26.379 --> 07:27.881
THE BADDEST [bleep].

07:27.881 --> 07:29.216
VAMOS, BABY.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.283
[laughs]

07:30.283 --> 07:32.385
THIS IS FOR YOU.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.521
SO ARE WE GIVING BAGS

07:33.521 --> 07:34.655
AND CASH?

07:34.655 --> 07:35.956
WHAT'S GONNA COME AFTER THIS?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.057
THIS AIN'T NO BULL[bleep].

07:37.057 --> 07:37.891
WHATEVER YOU NEED FROM ME,

07:37.891 --> 07:38.626
I GIVE IT TO YOU.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.628
DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT?

07:42.295 --> 07:43.296
I DON'T KNOW, STEVIE.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.532
I THINK IT'S EVERYTHING

07:44.532 --> 07:45.533
I'VE BEEN THROUGH,

07:45.533 --> 07:46.534
THAT IT'S JUST--

07:46.534 --> 07:47.768
EVERYTHING IS JUST CATCHING UP

07:47.768 --> 07:48.936
TO ME NOW.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.938
DO YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU?

08:05.886 --> 08:06.987
BEFORE I PACK MY BAGS

08:06.987 --> 08:08.556
AND GO TO PUERTO RICO,

08:08.556 --> 08:09.623
I GOT ONE LOOSE END

08:09.623 --> 08:11.291

08:11.291 --> 08:12.459
HELLO.

08:12.459 --> 08:13.326

08:15.696 --> 08:17.264

08:17.264 --> 08:18.566

08:18.566 --> 08:20.568
FOR A LITTLE, YOU KNOW,

08:20.568 --> 08:22.570
[bleep].

08:22.570 --> 08:23.704
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

08:23.704 --> 08:24.705
I'MA DO WHAT I GOT TO DO

08:24.705 --> 08:25.773
TO MAKE HER HAPPY.

08:25.773 --> 08:26.640
WELL, I JUST WANT TO LET YOU

08:26.640 --> 08:27.941

08:27.941 --> 08:29.142

08:29.142 --> 08:31.178

08:31.178 --> 08:32.079

08:32.079 --> 08:33.647
I'M GOING TO PUERTO RICO.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.583
I'M GOING TO SHOOT A FEW VIDEOS.

08:35.583 --> 08:36.249
PORN?

08:36.249 --> 08:37.818
NO, IT'S NO PORN THIS TIME.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.319

08:39.987 --> 08:40.654
YEAH.

08:40.654 --> 08:41.655

08:41.655 --> 08:42.322
MUSIC VIDEO.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.323
YEAH.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.257
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD SHOOT

08:44.257 --> 08:45.759
ANY OTHER VIDEO.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.595
YOU'RE NOT HAPPY FOR ME?

08:47.595 --> 08:48.228
YOU WANT ME TO DO

08:48.228 --> 08:49.129
A CARTWHEEL?

08:49.129 --> 08:50.163
DO YOU NOT WANT ME TO WORK,

08:50.163 --> 08:51.098
WITH ALL THE MONEY SHE BRINGING

08:51.098 --> 08:51.932

08:51.932 --> 08:53.466
I DON'T CARE.

08:53.466 --> 08:54.367
OKAY?

08:54.367 --> 08:55.068
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:55.068 --> 08:56.203

08:56.203 --> 08:58.305
JOSELINE IS STEVIE'S GRAVY TRAIN

08:58.305 --> 08:59.840
RIGHT NOW AND SHE MAKES A LOT

08:59.840 --> 09:00.774
OF MONEY FOR HIM,

09:00.774 --> 09:01.975
AND EVEN I GET A PERCENTAGE

09:01.975 --> 09:02.810
OF THIS MONEY.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.277
I WOULD BE A FOOL TO TRY

09:04.277 --> 09:05.478
AND SHUT THAT DOWN.

09:05.478 --> 09:06.446
BUT THIS CLOWN WANTS TO GO

09:06.446 --> 09:08.415
AROUND AND RUB MY NOSE IN IT?

09:08.415 --> 09:09.382
I'M NOT WITH THAT.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.350
JUST GIVE ME MY PERCENTAGE

09:10.350 --> 09:11.652
AND SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.319
WE'RE NOT GONNA WIN

09:12.319 --> 09:13.621
IF WE KEEP BEEFIN'.

09:13.621 --> 09:14.354
I'M NOT BEEFIN'.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.023
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA WIN?

09:16.023 --> 09:18.358
GREEN WORKS.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.727
THAT'S ALL YOU CARE ABOUT

09:19.727 --> 09:20.393
TOO.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.061
THAT'S NOT--

09:21.061 --> 09:21.895
IT'S NOT ALL I CARE ABOUT.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.263
YEAH, IT IS.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.265
AND...

09:27.167 --> 09:28.969

09:38.478 --> 09:39.346
YOU NEED.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.881
[chuckles]

09:40.881 --> 09:43.450
SO ARE WE GIVING BAGS AND CASH?

09:43.450 --> 09:44.551
[bleep] RIGHT.

09:44.551 --> 09:45.653
DOING JOSELINE'S VIDEO

09:45.653 --> 09:46.654
IN PUERTO RICO,

09:46.654 --> 09:48.355
IT'S GONNA BE VERY INEXPENSIVE,

09:48.355 --> 09:50.658
SO I AIN'T GOT NO PROBLEM AT ALL

09:50.658 --> 09:51.659
WITH TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF THAT

09:51.659 --> 09:54.127
BREAD AND PASSING IT ON TO MIMI.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.295
WE STILL GONNA MAKE

10:01.869 --> 10:03.036
WHAT'S GONNA COME AFTER THIS?

10:03.036 --> 10:05.172
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA ASK ME FOR?

10:05.172 --> 10:05.973
IT COMES WITH NO STRINGS

10:05.973 --> 10:07.074
ATTACHED.

10:07.074 --> 10:07.741
[sighs]

10:07.741 --> 10:08.742
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I HEARD

10:08.742 --> 10:09.743
THIS?

10:09.743 --> 10:10.911
YOU HEARD IT A FEW TIMES.

10:10.911 --> 10:11.812
I HEARD IT MORE THAN A FEW

10:11.812 --> 10:12.479
TIMES.

10:12.479 --> 10:13.313
BUT LOOK THOUGH,

10:13.313 --> 10:14.181
THIS AIN'T NO BULL[bleep].

10:14.181 --> 10:15.248
WHATEVER YOU NEED FROM ME,

10:15.248 --> 10:16.784
I GIVE IT TO YOU.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.418
DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT?

10:18.418 --> 10:19.687
SOMETIMES.

10:19.687 --> 10:20.587
OKAY, STEVIE,

10:20.587 --> 10:21.588
I'LL TAKE THE MONEY

10:21.588 --> 10:23.023
AND I'LL USE IT FOR SOMETHING

10:23.023 --> 10:23.857
FOR ME.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.592
SO IN ORDER FOR US TO HAVE

10:25.592 --> 10:26.894
EVERYTHING WE NEED,

10:26.894 --> 10:28.862
I CAN'T HAVE A LIFE.

10:28.862 --> 10:29.629
YEAH, I WANT YOU TO HAVE

10:29.629 --> 10:30.297

[laughs]

10:34.702 --> 10:37.270
OH.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.906
STEVIE J., DICTATOR.

10:38.906 --> 10:39.873
NO, IT'S NOT DICTATOR.

10:39.873 --> 10:40.640
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING

10:40.640 --> 10:41.308
HERE?

10:41.308 --> 10:42.509
IT'S LIKE, THE LIFE-TATOR.

10:42.509 --> 10:43.343
THE LIFE-TATOR?

10:43.343 --> 10:44.077
DO YOU WANT HAPPINESS,

10:44.077 --> 10:46.613
OR YOU WANT SOME OTHER [bleep]?

10:46.613 --> 10:47.781

10:50.117 --> 10:51.451
LET'S BE CLEAR ON THAT, OKAY?

10:51.451 --> 10:53.520

10:53.520 --> 10:54.521
NO, YOU DON'T.

10:54.521 --> 10:55.188
IT'S ALL GOOD.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.189
I AIN'T GONNA HOLD YOU UP.

10:56.189 --> 10:56.857
OKAY.

10:56.857 --> 10:57.691

10:59.760 --> 11:00.427
LET YOU GO AND DO

11:00.427 --> 11:01.762

11:06.533 --> 11:08.535
BARTENDER, ANOTHER ROUND.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.742
GOOD MORNING.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.109
TODAY I WILL BE CHECKING MYSELF

11:16.109 --> 11:19.046
INTO A DRUG REHABILITATION

11:19.046 --> 11:20.814
FOR MARIJUANA ADDICTION.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.649
IT IS MY HOPE THAT MY TIME

11:22.649 --> 11:23.784
AWAY FROM MY FAMILY,

11:23.784 --> 11:25.118
AND ESPECIALLY MY LITTLE GIRL,

11:25.118 --> 11:26.586
MY DAUGHTER,

11:26.586 --> 11:28.889
WILL MAKE ME A BETTER MAN,

11:28.889 --> 11:31.191
BUT I TAKE IT IN FAITH.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.592
I JUST ASK ALL MY FANS,

11:32.592 --> 11:35.595
MY FRIENDS, MY FAMILY,

11:35.595 --> 11:36.563
PEOPLE THAT DON'T EVEN HAVE

11:36.563 --> 11:37.898
GOOD STUFF TO SAY ABOUT ME,

11:37.898 --> 11:38.631
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING,

11:38.631 --> 11:40.067
JUST PRAY FOR ME,

11:40.067 --> 11:40.968
'CAUSE THAT'S THE RIGHT THING

11:40.968 --> 11:41.969
TO DO.

11:41.969 --> 11:44.071
THANK YOU.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.438
YOU DID A GOOD JOB, DOG.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.106
YOU DID A GOOD JOB, MAN.

11:46.106 --> 11:46.940
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

11:46.940 --> 11:47.941
YOU KNOW, YOU SPOKE FROM

11:47.941 --> 11:49.076
THE HEART, AND THAT'S WHAT'S

11:49.076 --> 11:49.777
IMPORTANT.

11:49.777 --> 11:50.778
NOW I KNOW HOW Y'ALL

11:50.778 --> 11:51.578
ARE THINKING, Y'ALL LIKE,

11:51.578 --> 11:52.579
YOU KNOW, "SCRAP DOING THIS

11:52.579 --> 11:54.181
'CAUSE HE GOT TO GO TO COURT,

11:54.181 --> 11:55.048
YOU KNOW, HE DON'T WANT TO GO

11:55.048 --> 11:56.149
TO JAIL."

11:56.149 --> 11:57.684
BUT WHO WANTS TO GO TO JAIL

11:57.684 --> 11:58.685
FOR SMOKING MARIJUANA?

11:58.685 --> 11:59.652
SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO

11:59.652 --> 12:01.154
IS I'M GONNA BITE DOWN AND JUST

12:01.154 --> 12:02.923
EAT THEM 30 DAYS UP.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.657
THIS AIN'T JAIL, BUT, YOU KNOW,

12:04.657 --> 12:05.325
I'M STILL NERVOUS.

12:05.325 --> 12:05.993
IT'S NOT JAIL,

12:05.993 --> 12:06.659
BUT YOU LOCKED DOWN.

12:06.659 --> 12:07.327
YEAH, LIKE...

12:07.327 --> 12:07.995
YOU'RE LOCKED DOWN.

12:07.995 --> 12:08.796
THEY'RE GONNA MONITOR YOU

12:08.796 --> 12:09.797
FOR 24 HOURS A DAY.

12:09.797 --> 12:10.798
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE

12:10.798 --> 12:11.799
TO COME AND GO AS YOU PLEASE--

12:11.799 --> 12:13.066
NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO LEAVE.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.068
IT'S FOR A MINIMUM OF 30 DAYS.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.103
HOW THEY DOING IT ON,

12:16.103 --> 12:17.670
YOU KNOW, LIKE, VISIT, LIKE,

12:17.670 --> 12:18.906
MY LITTLE GIRL, YOU KNOW?

12:18.906 --> 12:21.108
FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS,

12:21.108 --> 12:22.876
YOU'RE GONNA BE COLD TURKEY.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.477
SO, YOU KNOW, NO PHONE,

12:24.477 --> 12:27.147
NO TWEETIN', NONE OF THAT.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.016
AND THEN AFTER THAT,

12:29.016 --> 12:30.483
YOU CAN--YOU KNOW, THEY'LL BE

12:30.483 --> 12:31.819
ABLE TO HAVE A FAMILY DAY,

12:31.819 --> 12:32.685
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

12:32.685 --> 12:33.686
BUT WE'LL BE THERE TO SUPPORT

12:33.686 --> 12:36.023
YOU, SO IF YOU GO IN THERE

12:36.023 --> 12:38.391
AND YOU ARE FOCUSED

12:38.391 --> 12:39.726
AND YOU DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO,

12:39.726 --> 12:41.261
THEN I WOULD THINK THE 30 DAYS

12:41.261 --> 12:42.329
WILL BE IT.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.530
BECAUSE EVERY REPORT--

12:43.530 --> 12:44.364
I'VE GOT TO TAKE IT--

12:44.364 --> 12:45.398
I'M GONNA TAKE IT TO THE JUDGE.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.066
I'M GONNA TAKE IT TO

12:46.066 --> 12:47.000
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND SAY,

12:47.000 --> 12:48.568
"LOOK, HERE'S HOW HE'S DOING,"

12:48.568 --> 12:49.837
AND SO THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GONNA

12:49.837 --> 12:50.938
BE LOOKING AT TO DETERMINE

12:50.938 --> 12:52.572
WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOULD REMAIN

12:52.572 --> 12:54.975
IN THAT FACILITY, OR THEY SAY,

12:54.975 --> 12:55.675
"WELL, NO, COME ON,

12:55.675 --> 12:56.343
PULL HIM OUT.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.344
HE'S PLAYING OVER THERE TOO.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.011
PULL HIM OUT.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.012
LET'S JUST PUT HIM IN JAIL

12:59.012 --> 13:00.013
AND HE CAN GO THROUGH OUR

13:00.013 --> 13:02.082
FACILITY IN THE JAIL."

13:06.419 --> 13:07.254
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

13:07.254 --> 13:08.255
SOUTHWEST WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME

13:08.255 --> 13:10.057

13:16.196 --> 13:16.864

13:18.598 --> 13:19.666
OH, MY GOD.

13:19.666 --> 13:20.367
IT'S TIME TO GET TO IT

13:20.367 --> 13:21.034
RIGHT NOW.

13:21.034 --> 13:21.869
BABY, I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE

13:21.869 --> 13:23.871
SINCE I WAS, LIKE, SEVEN.

13:23.871 --> 13:24.872
[upbeat Latin music]

13:24.872 --> 13:30.878
♪

13:30.878 --> 13:32.079
I DIDN'T EVEN IMAGINE COMING

13:32.079 --> 13:34.081
BACK TO PUERTO RICO.

13:39.953 --> 13:40.653
YOU RUNNING AROUND

13:40.653 --> 13:41.955
WITH NO SHOES ON.

13:41.955 --> 13:42.722
I DIDN'T HAVE THAT MANY

13:42.722 --> 13:43.957
SHOES.

13:43.957 --> 13:44.757
I ONLY HAD SHOES TO GO

13:44.757 --> 13:47.227
TO SCHOOL.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.962
GROWING UP, I DIDN'T HAVE

13:48.962 --> 13:49.997
A LOT OF SHOES EITHER.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.664
I HAD TO WEAR THE HAND-ME-DOWNS.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.499
WELL, AT LEAST YOU HAD

13:52.499 --> 13:53.400
HAND-ME-DOWNS.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.401
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY SISTER--

13:54.401 --> 13:55.368
WELL, I GOT AN OLDER SISTER,

13:55.368 --> 13:56.536
BUT I COULDN'T WEAR HER

13:56.536 --> 13:57.204
HAND-ME-DOWNS.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.405
SHE WAS WAY OLDER.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.739
AND I COULDN'T WEAR MY BROTHER'S

13:59.739 --> 14:02.309
HAND-ME-DOWNS, SO I WAS [bleep].

14:02.309 --> 14:03.343
WHEN I GOT OFF THE PLANE,

14:03.343 --> 14:04.511
YOU KNOW, I'M FEELING,

14:04.511 --> 14:05.278
I'M OVER HERE.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.046
I GOT ALL OF THESE THINGS

14:06.046 --> 14:06.914
GOING THROUGH MY HEAD, LIKE,

14:06.914 --> 14:09.182
YOU KNOW, I WISH MY MOM

14:09.182 --> 14:10.183
WAS THERE FOR ME.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.818
I WISH MY MOM WASN'T ON DRUGS.

14:11.818 --> 14:12.920
I WISH I WOULD'VE NEVER GOT

14:12.920 --> 14:13.921
RAPED.

14:13.921 --> 14:14.922
I WISH I WOULD'VE NEVER LEFT

14:14.922 --> 14:15.923
THE HOUSE WHEN I WAS 12.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.724
IT WASN'T JUST THE PUERTO RICO

14:17.724 --> 14:19.359
ISSUES THAT I HAD GROWING UP.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.229
IT WAS MY WHOLE LIFE ISSUES

14:22.229 --> 14:24.031
THAT CAME OUT IN PUERTO RICO.

14:24.031 --> 14:24.965
YOU'RE NOT EXCITED

14:24.965 --> 14:25.698

14:25.698 --> 14:26.733
I'M EXCITED.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.235

14:31.804 --> 14:32.672
JUST WANT TO DO MY VIDEO

14:32.672 --> 14:34.107
AND GET BACK HOME.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.108
I THOUGHT BY US COMING

14:35.108 --> 14:36.543
TO PUERTO RICO IT WOULD'VE PUT

14:36.543 --> 14:38.345
A SMILE ON JOSELINE'S FACE,

14:38.345 --> 14:39.046
BUT FOR SOME REASON

14:39.046 --> 14:40.247
SHE'S NOT HAPPY.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.249
I MADE THE SHOOT HAPPEN FOR HER.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.416
SHE SHOULD BE EXCITED.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.684
BUT YET, STILL,

14:44.684 --> 14:45.752
I'MA TURN IT AROUND.

14:45.752 --> 14:46.954
I'MA MAKE IT A GREAT SITUATION,

14:46.954 --> 14:47.955
'CAUSE WE OUT IN PUERTO RICO

14:47.955 --> 14:49.256
AND WE GOT WORK TO DO.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.790
WE GOT BREAD ON THE TABLE.

14:50.790 --> 14:51.491
WHERE'S THE PUERTO RICAN

14:51.491 --> 14:52.993
PRINCESS?

14:52.993 --> 14:53.760
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE

14:53.760 --> 14:54.694
THE PUERTO RICAN PRINCESS.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.696
YOU LOOK LIKE--YOU LOOK SAD.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.268
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW BAD

15:01.268 --> 15:03.270
I WANT TO BE HAPPY.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.981
SAY SOMETHING TO ME.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.183
WHAT ARE THE TEARS ABOUT?

15:16.183 --> 15:17.517
LIKE, I'M FINALLY HERE NOW,

15:17.517 --> 15:18.785
AND IT'S LIKE, EVERYTHING

15:18.785 --> 15:20.353

15:20.353 --> 15:21.354
I KNOW JOSELINE'S FEELING

15:21.354 --> 15:23.256
SOME TYPE OF WAY ABOUT BEING

15:23.256 --> 15:24.992
BACK IN PUERTO RICO AGAIN,

15:24.992 --> 15:25.825
BUT YOU KNOW AT THE END

15:25.825 --> 15:26.659
OF THE DAY, BABY GIRL,

15:26.659 --> 15:27.460
YOU AIN'T GOT TO WORRY ABOUT

15:27.460 --> 15:28.595
NOBODY ELSE.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.429
I GOT YOU.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.430
WHAT'S [bleep] WITH YOU

15:30.430 --> 15:31.698
THAT I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH?

15:31.698 --> 15:33.633
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.002
I DON'T KNOW, STEVIE,

15:35.002 --> 15:36.003
I THINK IT'S JUST EVERYTHING

15:36.003 --> 15:37.104
I'VE BEEN THROUGH,

15:37.104 --> 15:38.138
THAT IT'S JUST--

15:38.138 --> 15:39.439
EVERYTHING IS JUST CATCHING UP

15:39.439 --> 15:40.540
TO ME NOW.

15:40.540 --> 15:41.574
IT'S CATCHING UP TO YOU.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.010
I HAVE NO FAMILY.

15:43.010 --> 15:43.876
I HAVE NO DAD.

15:43.876 --> 15:44.844
I'M YOUR FAMILY.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.246
MY DAD--MY DAD DIED

15:46.246 --> 15:47.014
OF AN OVERDOSE.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.615
I DON'T KNOW MY UNCLES.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.017
I NEVER MET MY GRANDMA.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.218
I HAVE NOBODY.

15:51.218 --> 15:52.085
SO LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

15:52.085 --> 15:52.852
AND YOU KNOW EVERYTHING

15:52.852 --> 15:53.520
I'VE BEEN THROUGH,

15:53.520 --> 15:54.254
AND INSTEAD OF YOU TRYING

15:54.254 --> 15:55.222
TO HELP ME OUT AND TRYING TO

15:55.222 --> 15:55.888
UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M--

15:55.888 --> 15:56.789
I DON'T HELP YOU OUT?

15:56.789 --> 15:57.490
INSTEAD OF YOU TRYING

15:57.490 --> 15:59.892
TO UNDERSTAND AND FEELING

15:59.892 --> 16:02.529
ANY TYPE OF WAY ABOUT THE FACT

16:02.529 --> 16:03.730
THAT I FEEL LIKE THIS,

16:03.730 --> 16:04.731
IT'S LIKE, YOU PUSH ME MORE

16:04.731 --> 16:05.565
THEN.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.267
IT'S ALWAYS--IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT

16:07.267 --> 16:07.934
YOU.

16:07.934 --> 16:08.935
"I DO THIS," AND, "I DO THAT."

16:08.935 --> 16:09.936
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep] ABOUT

16:09.936 --> 16:10.603
THAT.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.904
I DON'T--I DON'T EVEN--

16:11.904 --> 16:13.373
[sighs]

16:13.373 --> 16:15.375
AM I NOT YOUR FAMILY?

16:19.579 --> 16:21.948
ANSWER ME, JOSELINE.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.483
AM I NOT YOUR FAMILY?

16:23.483 --> 16:26.653
YES.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.655
I'M THERE FOR YOU EVERY DAY.

16:39.799 --> 16:40.833
I LOVE YOU TOO, I'M JUST--

16:40.833 --> 16:41.501
IT'S A LOT.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.335
CAN I HOLD YOU?

16:42.335 --> 16:44.071
IT'S A LOT I'VE BEEN THROUGH,

16:44.071 --> 16:44.704
STEVIE.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.174
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET OVER IT.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.975
I'M TRYING TO GET OVER IT.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.110
I REALLY ENJOY MY LIFE,

16:50.110 --> 16:51.311
BUT THERE'S SOME THINGS

16:51.311 --> 16:52.512
THAT I'M STILL DEALING WITH,

16:52.512 --> 16:53.180
YOU KNOW?

16:53.180 --> 16:54.714
AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN I GOT

16:54.714 --> 16:55.482
TO PUERTO RICO,

16:55.482 --> 16:56.616
I GOT A LITTLE EMOTIONAL.

16:56.616 --> 16:57.650
I HAD TO DEAL WITH A LOT

16:57.650 --> 16:58.685
OF THINGS IN MY PAST.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.221
BUT I GUESS I NEEDED TO CRY.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.889
I NEEDED TO LET TEARS OUT

17:02.889 --> 17:05.858
TO REALLY, REALLY GET TO WHERE,

17:05.858 --> 17:08.095
YOU KNOW, WHERE I'M AT NOW.

17:08.095 --> 17:08.928
YOU CAN CRY ON MY SHOULDER.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.930
YOU CAN WET MY WIFEBEATER UP.

17:14.634 --> 17:15.302
I WANT A HAPPY JOSELINE.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.303
THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN CRYING

17:16.303 --> 17:17.437
SO MUCH LATELY,

17:17.437 --> 17:18.238
'CAUSE IT'S LIKE,

17:18.238 --> 17:20.107
EVERYTHING'S FALLING DOWN ON ME,

17:20.107 --> 17:21.108
IT FEELS LIKE.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.675
SHH, DON'T LET IT DO THAT.

17:22.675 --> 17:23.610
THERE'S SOMETHING ALWAYS

17:23.610 --> 17:24.411
NEGATIVE IN THE UNIVERSE

17:24.411 --> 17:25.578
TO TRY TO PULL YOU DOWN.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.247
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.749
I LOVE YOU, OKAY?

17:29.749 --> 17:32.219
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.222
GIVE ME A HUG.

17:35.222 --> 17:38.291
YOU'RE MY BABY, OKAY.

17:41.961 --> 17:42.662
FROM HERE

17:42.662 --> 17:44.631
UNTIL THE TIME I GET OUT,

17:44.631 --> 17:46.799
JUST REALLY CONSIDER

17:46.799 --> 17:49.702

17:50.637 --> 17:52.139

17:52.139 --> 17:53.440
I HAVE TO START DOING WHAT

17:53.440 --> 17:55.808
I NEED TO DO TO PROTECT MYSELF.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.210
SO AT THE TIME AND PRESENT

17:57.210 --> 17:58.911
RIGHT NOW, WHAT'S GOING ON

17:58.911 --> 18:01.448
IS A FILING OF A SEPARATION.

18:16.629 --> 18:17.630
SO WHY I GOT TO WAKE UP

18:17.630 --> 18:19.166
EVERY OTHER DAY AND SEEM LIKE

18:37.384 --> 18:38.050
TO BE ON THE INTERNET

18:38.050 --> 18:38.751
MORE THAN YOU'RE TRYING

18:38.751 --> 18:39.419
TO BE HOME.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.687
I MEAN, LIKE, HOW MUCH YOU THINK

18:40.687 --> 18:41.354

18:45.258 --> 18:46.859
I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP

18:46.859 --> 18:49.196

"CAN I TAKE A PICTURE?

18:56.102 --> 18:56.769
CAN I TAKE A PICTURE?"

18:56.769 --> 18:57.904
IF I START SAYING "NO,"

18:57.904 --> 18:59.239
THEN I'M GONNA BE A RUDE ASS.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.307
THAT'S SOME PEER PRESSURE,

19:00.307 --> 19:01.308
LIKE, "COME ON, KIRK,

19:03.776 --> 19:04.677
THERE WITH HIS SHIRT OFF,

19:04.677 --> 19:05.778

19:05.778 --> 19:06.813
WE AIN'T DOING NOTHING.

19:06.813 --> 19:07.547
I TOOK IT.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.748
SO YOU GOT PEER PRESSURED

19:08.748 --> 19:09.916

19:09.916 --> 19:10.717
THE CRAZY PART ABOUT

19:10.717 --> 19:11.718
THE WHOLE SITUATION

19:11.718 --> 19:13.853
IS THE PUBLIC HUMILIATION

19:13.853 --> 19:15.322
THAT THIS FOOL IS PUTTING ME

19:15.322 --> 19:15.988
THROUGH.

19:15.988 --> 19:16.656
I HAVE A BRAND.

19:16.656 --> 19:17.657
I HAVE A COMPANIES.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.658

19:18.658 --> 19:20.327

19:20.327 --> 19:21.728

19:21.728 --> 19:22.829
TO MESS UP ANYTHING THAT

19:22.829 --> 19:24.297
I'VE BEEN WORKING SO HARD FOR.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.798
REAL TALK, I'M AT THE POINT

19:25.798 --> 19:27.434
RIGHT NOW WHERE I'VE GOT TO TAKE

19:27.434 --> 19:28.901
MATTERS INTO MY OWN HANDS.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.003
I FEEL LIKE AS A WOMAN,

19:31.003 --> 19:33.039
AS A MOTHER,

19:33.039 --> 19:34.274
I HAVE TO START DOING

19:34.274 --> 19:35.475
WHAT I NEED TO DO TO PROTECT

19:35.475 --> 19:37.076
MYSELF.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.278
BECAUSE I'M FEELING LIKE,

19:38.278 --> 19:39.412
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:39.412 --> 19:41.448
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOUR HEAD IS.

19:41.448 --> 19:42.582
I'MA JUST KEEP IT REAL WITH YOU.

19:42.582 --> 19:43.850
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE LAWYER

19:43.850 --> 19:46.353
ABOUT US, OUR RELATIONSHIP,

19:46.353 --> 19:47.554
OUR SITUATION,

19:47.554 --> 19:49.289
AND BASICALLY IN GEORGIA, YES,

19:49.289 --> 19:49.956
WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED

19:49.956 --> 19:52.592
IT'S A 50/50 TYPE OF SITUATION,

19:52.592 --> 19:53.260
BUT...

19:53.260 --> 19:54.093
YOU CRAZY.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.795
WHEN YOU ARE IN ACTS

19:55.795 --> 19:58.798
OF ADULTERY OR THINGS THAT LOOK

19:58.798 --> 20:00.300
LIKE ADULTERY, THEN THAT CHANGES

20:00.300 --> 20:01.468
THE BALL GAME.

20:01.468 --> 20:02.134
AND REALLY,

20:02.134 --> 20:02.969
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

20:02.969 --> 20:03.970

20:03.970 --> 20:05.071

20:06.373 --> 20:07.940

20:10.277 --> 20:11.110
I THOUGHT WE WAS BETTER

20:11.110 --> 20:11.778

20:11.778 --> 20:12.612
I KNOW I [bleep] UP.

20:12.612 --> 20:13.913
I KNOW I DID SOME THINGS,

20:13.913 --> 20:15.615
BUT I MEAN, I AIN'T DO NOTHING

20:15.615 --> 20:16.349
TOO BAD.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.617
DIVORCE, LIKE, FOR REAL?

20:17.617 --> 20:18.718
50%?

20:18.718 --> 20:20.219
YOU HAVE NOTHING, RASHEEDA.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.788
SO TAKE YOUR ASS BACK

20:21.788 --> 20:22.955
TO THE DRAWING BOARD

20:22.955 --> 20:23.890
AND LEARN HOW TO LOVE YOUR

20:23.890 --> 20:24.857
[bleep] HUSBAND LIKE YOU'RE

20:24.857 --> 20:25.892

BUT I MEAN, A PICTURE?

20:26.893 --> 20:27.994
COME ON, LIKE--

20:27.994 --> 20:29.396
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST THAT.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.129
IT'S ABOUT YOU,

20:30.129 --> 20:31.130
WHERE YOUR HEART IS,

20:31.130 --> 20:33.500
WHERE YOU ARE.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.334
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW,

20:34.334 --> 20:36.035
YOU'RE NOT IN THIS.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.236
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE

20:37.236 --> 20:38.137
IN THIS STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN...

20:38.137 --> 20:38.805
I'M HERE, MAN.

20:38.805 --> 20:39.472
I'M TRYING MY BEST.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.473
WE NEED TO TAKE THE STEPS

20:40.473 --> 20:43.276
IT TAKE TO BE OUT OF THIS.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.677
IF YOU WANT THIS FAMILY,

20:44.677 --> 20:45.878
IF YOU WANT THIS LIFE,

20:45.878 --> 20:46.679
IF YOU LOVE ME,

20:46.679 --> 20:47.980
IF YOU LOVE YOUR FAMILY,

20:47.980 --> 20:49.716

20:49.716 --> 20:51.150
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW HOW

20:51.150 --> 20:53.386
TO FIX IT TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND

20:53.386 --> 20:54.587
THIS IS WHAT IS WANT.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.422
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU, BUT--

20:55.422 --> 20:56.088
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU

20:56.088 --> 20:56.756
SOMETHING.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.257
I WANT A COMMITTED HUSBAND.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.258
I WANT A RELATIONSHIP.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.126
I WANT MY FRIEND BACK.

21:00.126 --> 21:00.793
IF THAT'S NOT WHAT

21:00.793 --> 21:01.861
IT'S GONNA BE, THEN COOL.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.596
SO AT THE TIME AND PRESENT

21:03.596 --> 21:05.365
RIGHT NOW, WHAT'S GOING ON

21:05.365 --> 21:08.100
IS A FILING OF A SEPARATION.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.110
I INVITED ERICA TO COME

21:18.110 --> 21:19.446
TO THE DOCTOR WITH ME.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.747
I'M GOING TO GET MY CONSULTATION

21:20.747 --> 21:22.482
FOR MY MOMMY MAKEOVER.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.550
LET'S BE CLEAR:

21:23.550 --> 21:25.418
I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE I NURSED

21:25.418 --> 21:27.654
MY DAUGHTER FOR THREE YEARS.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.021
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING

21:29.021 --> 21:32.191
FOR MYSELF, AND I DESERVE IT.

21:32.191 --> 21:33.726
SO YOU'RE REALLY GONNA DO IT?

21:33.726 --> 21:34.927
YES.

21:34.927 --> 21:35.862
YOU'RE POSITIVE THIS IS WHAT

21:35.862 --> 21:36.696
YOU WANT TO DO?

21:36.696 --> 21:37.530
I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHAT,

21:37.530 --> 21:38.531
THESE TWO GIRLS ARE GONNA BE

21:38.531 --> 21:39.832
BETTER THAN THOSE TWO SORRY-ASS

21:39.832 --> 21:40.767
[bleep] I WAS DATING.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.134
BAM, BAM.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.903
ANY DAY, OKAY.

21:43.903 --> 21:44.904
OH, AND I SAW STEVIE

21:44.904 --> 21:46.373
THE OTHER DAY.

21:46.373 --> 21:47.474
HE TOLD ME HE WAS GOING

21:47.474 --> 21:49.376
OUT OF TOWN FOR A WHILE,

21:49.376 --> 21:51.143
AND "I'M GONNA GO SHOOT

21:51.143 --> 21:52.379
JOSELINE'S VIDEO."

21:52.379 --> 21:54.146
SO HE BRINGS ME A GIFT,

21:54.146 --> 21:55.247
AND IT'S A PURSE

21:55.247 --> 21:56.516
AND IT HAD MONEY IN IT,

21:56.516 --> 21:58.217
AND I WAS JUST LIKE, "DUDE,

21:58.217 --> 21:59.752
HERE WE GO AGAIN WITH THIS."

21:59.752 --> 22:00.520
DOWN THAT SAME ROAD.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.821
DOWN THE SAME ROAD.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.089
EVERY TIME HE GIVES ME SOMETHING

22:03.089 --> 22:04.223
YOU KNOW HE EXPECTS SOMETHING

22:04.223 --> 22:05.592
FROM IT.

22:05.592 --> 22:06.693
IT'S NOT JUST, "HERE YOU GO."

22:06.693 --> 22:08.094
BUT I'M LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:08.094 --> 22:09.295
I'MA TAKE IT, AND I'MA GO GET

22:09.295 --> 22:10.397
A BOOB JOB.

22:10.397 --> 22:11.598
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR.

22:11.598 --> 22:12.399
YOU DON'T THINK HE GONNA

22:12.399 --> 22:13.400
BE LIKE, "YO, MA."

22:13.400 --> 22:14.000
I DON'T CARE.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.301
"BRING THEM BOOBS OVER HERE."

22:15.301 --> 22:16.636
HE CAN'T TAKE THESE BACK.

22:16.636 --> 22:17.870
CAN'T TELL ME TO GO PARK THESE

22:17.870 --> 22:18.738
IN THE GARAGE.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.407
[laughs]

22:20.407 --> 22:21.307
SORRY.

22:21.307 --> 22:21.974
HELLO.

22:21.974 --> 22:22.642
HI.

22:22.642 --> 22:23.309
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

22:23.309 --> 22:24.143
GOOD, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

22:24.143 --> 22:25.144
MY NAME IS DR. JIMERSON.

22:25.144 --> 22:25.812
MIMI.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.279
NICE TO MEET YOU.

22:27.279 --> 22:29.281
SO HOW CAN I HELP YOU TODAY?

22:29.281 --> 22:30.182
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT GETTING

22:30.182 --> 22:31.751
MY GIRLS BACK WHERE THEY USED

22:31.751 --> 22:32.452
TO BE.

22:32.452 --> 22:33.486
DO YOU WANT TO LOOK NATURAL,

22:33.486 --> 22:34.153
OR DO YOU WANT TO--

22:34.153 --> 22:34.987
I WANT TO LOOK NATURAL.

22:34.987 --> 22:35.988
I DON'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE

22:35.988 --> 22:37.724
I GOT BASEBALLS UP TO MY NECK.

22:37.724 --> 22:38.558
ABSOLUTELY, OKAY.

22:38.558 --> 22:39.225
YES.

22:39.225 --> 22:39.892
SO LET ME ASK YOU

22:39.892 --> 22:40.560
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.428
YES.

22:41.428 --> 22:42.429
WHY ARE YOU GETTING

22:42.429 --> 22:43.162
THIS SURGERY?

22:43.162 --> 22:44.163
FIRST THING'S FIRST,

22:44.163 --> 22:45.164
I HAD A BABY...

22:45.164 --> 22:45.832
OKAY.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.233
AND I NURSED FOR THREE YEARS.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.435
THREE YEARS IS A LONG TIME.

22:48.435 --> 22:49.569
THREE YEARS IS A LONG TIME,

22:49.569 --> 22:50.236
YEAH.

22:50.236 --> 22:51.337
WHEN SHE STARTED ASKING FOR IT

22:51.337 --> 22:52.539
WITH THE MOUTH FULL OF TEETH,

22:52.539 --> 22:53.906
I'M LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, GIRL,

22:53.906 --> 22:55.642
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH WITH

22:55.642 --> 22:56.342
THE NURSING."

22:56.342 --> 22:57.009
YEAH.

22:57.009 --> 22:57.677
SO THERE'S NOT--

22:57.677 --> 22:59.078
I MEAN, THERE'S NO GUY OR ANY--

22:59.078 --> 22:59.746
OH, GOD, NO.

22:59.746 --> 23:00.580
OKAY, I JUST WANTED

23:00.580 --> 23:01.247
TO MAKE SURE.

23:01.247 --> 23:02.715
GOD, NO GUY.

23:02.715 --> 23:03.683
WE ALWAYS WANT PEOPLE

23:03.683 --> 23:04.917
TO DO IT FOR THE RIGHT REASON.

23:04.917 --> 23:05.652
IT'S FOR ME.

23:05.652 --> 23:06.453
OKAY, IT'S FOR YOU.

23:06.453 --> 23:08.855
I HAVE HAD A HORRIBLE

23:08.855 --> 23:10.322
RELATIONSHIP ISSUE

23:10.322 --> 23:11.323
WITH MY DAUGHTER'S FATHER,

23:11.323 --> 23:12.559
BUT HE'S NOT THE REASON

23:12.559 --> 23:13.560
THAT I WANT TO GET IT DONE.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.595
I WANT TO GET THIS DONE FOR ME.

23:15.595 --> 23:18.465
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO PUT ON

23:18.465 --> 23:19.699
A BIKINI AND WALK AROUND

23:19.699 --> 23:21.067
THE BEACH WITH PERKY BREASTS.

23:21.067 --> 23:21.934
AND I DON'T MEAN TO INSULT

23:21.934 --> 23:22.669
YOU WITH THESE QUESTIONS.

23:22.669 --> 23:23.335
I'M JUST--

23:23.335 --> 23:24.003
OH, NO.

23:24.003 --> 23:24.871
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

23:24.871 --> 23:25.872
I GET DOWN TO THE ROOT

23:25.872 --> 23:27.373
OF THE ISSUE, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

23:27.373 --> 23:28.975
IF I OPERATE ON SOMEONE WHO IS

23:28.975 --> 23:30.076
DOING IT FOR THE WRONG REASON,
