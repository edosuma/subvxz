WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.303
You're teaming up
with the guys from Ghosted.

00:02.336 --> 00:04.072
I could have died
in there!

00:04.105 --> 00:05.973
Aw, somebody
need a hug?

00:06.006 --> 00:07.641
Catch all-new episodes Sundays.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.277
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.310 --> 00:12.113
The Orville, Gotham,
and Lucifer.

00:12.146 --> 00:13.581
Remember me?

00:13.614 --> 00:14.782
Only on Fox.

00:18.552 --> 00:21.222
MAX: Barry, your favorite
director is Michael Bay.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.990
Right. Yeah. A real inspiration.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.492
-You like all of his movies?
-Yeah.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.160
-I love all those movies.
-(laughter)

00:26.194 --> 00:28.162
Hey, what's with LaFrey's getup?

00:28.196 --> 00:29.763
It's a water delivery day.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.165
She has a crush
on the water delivery guy.

00:31.199 --> 00:33.201
-Shh. -All right everyone,
stop whispering about me,

00:33.234 --> 00:35.203
-and listen up. -LEROY: The
water deliver guy has clearance?

00:35.236 --> 00:36.870
Oh, God, no.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.839
-Sinkholes. -BOB: Hey, guys?
Something's really wrong.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.308
It's an emergency,
I messed up bad.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.477
What is it?

00:43.511 --> 00:46.214
I ordered way too many donuts.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.715
-What?
-ALL: Oh!

00:47.748 --> 00:49.850
-(laughter)
-Get in there.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.553
-You're the best. Oh, man.
-Oh, my God. There's so many.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.388
-Look at this. -Bob, Bob, Bob,
Bob. -LEROY: Thank you, Bob.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.023
-These gluten free?
-BOB: Those are gluten free.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.358
Those are double gluten.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.992
Like, so much gluten in there.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.661
-Oh, my man.
-BOB: I guess like you guys.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.896
-MAX: Oh, my God. -BOB: Anyway,
I would love to hang around

01:02.930 --> 01:04.365
and have a little donut party
with my favorite people,

01:04.398 --> 01:06.567
but I got to go start an autopsy
on that cadaver

01:06.600 --> 01:08.902
from the Dublin office,
but reminder:

01:08.936 --> 01:10.538
I'm having a little BBQ tonight
if you guys

01:10.571 --> 01:12.340
-want to stop by.
-LEROY: BBQ on a Tuesday?

01:12.373 --> 01:14.342
-That's genius. -BOB: Yeah,
it's gonna be all right.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.910
I'm doing a couple beer can
chickens. It's gonna be fun.

01:16.944 --> 01:19.413
I'll bet there'll be some, just,
regular old beer cans, huh?

01:19.447 --> 01:21.115
-We'll drink some brewskis?
-Yeah.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.950
There will be some beer cans
filled with frosty brewskis.

01:22.983 --> 01:25.052
-Uh, have you been spying on me?
-Oh!

01:25.085 --> 01:26.920
-You been spying on me?
-(laughter) -ANNIE: Ah, man.

01:26.954 --> 01:29.423
I wish that I could go.
I promised my boyfriend

01:29.457 --> 01:31.225
that I would videotape
his new free throw technique.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.261
It's-it's granny style.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.062
Oh, that's so smart. I mean,
it looks a little silly,

01:35.095 --> 01:36.264
but it's so much more effective.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.565
That's what he said.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.133
Well, I'll let him know
you said that. Thanks.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.769
Bob. Bob, Bob, Bob.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.237
I-I just wanted to say,

01:43.271 --> 01:46.073
you're the best person
I've ever met.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.410
Well, that's only 'cause you
can't meet yourself, champ.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.644
MAX:
Bob.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.013
ALL (chanting):
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,

01:53.046 --> 01:55.583
-Bob, Bob, Bob.
-LaFREY: Okay.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.917
Sinkholes.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.119
* Yeah, it's a wonder
man can eat at all *

01:59.153 --> 02:01.522
* When things are big
that should be small *

02:01.555 --> 02:06.560
* Who can tell what magic spells
we'll be doing for us *

02:06.594 --> 02:09.297
-* And I'm giving all my love
to this world * -Mm.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.233
* Only to be told...

02:12.266 --> 02:14.402
Oh, oh, oh.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.069
* No more will we be...

02:16.103 --> 02:17.771
(inhaling)

02:17.805 --> 02:19.673
Mm.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.442
(chuckles)

02:21.475 --> 02:23.677
* But never give,
and now that things *

02:23.711 --> 02:25.579
(volume increasing):
-* Are changing for the worse

02:25.613 --> 02:27.114
* See, oh...

02:27.147 --> 02:29.116
* It's a crazy world
we're livin' in *

02:29.149 --> 02:31.118
(creature growling quietly)

02:31.151 --> 02:33.153
* And I just can't see
that half of us immersed... *

02:33.187 --> 02:35.456
You know, there is a theory
that sinkholes are the result

02:35.489 --> 02:37.425
-of a secret society
of mole people. -Mole people.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.026
-Jinx.
-Jinx.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.728
-Double jinx. Oh! -Double jinx.
You owe me two thumbs.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.863
-(laughing): Oh! What?
-You don't do two thumbs?

02:42.896 --> 02:44.798
-I didn't... No.
-MAX: Yeah, you owe me two...

02:44.832 --> 02:46.800
(creature rattling, growling)

02:46.834 --> 02:50.037
* Futures made of virtual
insanity now... *

02:50.070 --> 02:52.906
(gasping)

02:52.940 --> 02:55.276
-That's right.
You never heard that? -No.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.044
-It's Bob.
-LaFREY: Oh, Bob.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.646
He's a hoot.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.681
-You can't have any donuts, Bob.
-(laughter)

03:00.714 --> 03:03.251
We got them all.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.352
(muffled):
Help!

03:04.385 --> 03:07.120
(creature growling)

03:07.154 --> 03:08.722
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.458
-(shouts)
-ANNIE: Oh, God!

03:11.559 --> 03:13.327
-(screaming)
-Bob, no!

03:13.361 --> 03:14.795
(screaming)

03:14.828 --> 03:16.330
-(shouting)
-(bones cracking)

03:16.364 --> 03:18.098
-MAX: No.
-ANNIE: No!

03:18.131 --> 03:20.301
LaFREY: Don't worry.
That glass is bulletproof.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.469
That thing will never
get out of that room.

03:21.502 --> 03:22.903
-(roaring)
-(screaming)

03:22.936 --> 03:25.072
-Oh! Whoa!
-(creature growling)

03:25.105 --> 03:26.640
-(screams)
-LaFREY: Oh, my God.

03:28.776 --> 03:31.712
Okay, calm down, everyone.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.013
(woman screams)

03:33.046 --> 03:35.148
-(creature roars)
-LaFREY: Careful.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.519
-Lisa!
-Ellen!

03:38.552 --> 03:41.221
Wha... Dude,
it was Ellen, right?

03:41.255 --> 03:44.057
I-I thought it was Lisa.
I'm not, I'm not sure.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.093
*

03:49.096 --> 03:50.564
All right. Come on, people.
Pull it together.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.199
I'm going to call
Director Romslo

03:52.232 --> 03:53.934
-and find out how to proceed.
-MAX: I'm sorry,

03:53.967 --> 03:56.304
-who is Director Romslo?
-My boss.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.871
Everyone has a boss,
Max. Even me.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.473
Get me Romslo.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.241
Oh, Captain LaFrey.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.710
What's going on?

04:02.743 --> 04:05.313
Sir, we have a predator
of unknown species

04:05.346 --> 04:06.747
loose in the building.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.182
A predator. How did this happen?

04:09.216 --> 04:10.851
It was the Dublin
cadaver transfer.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.586
Apparently, it wasn't dead.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.756
The Dublin cadaver?

04:15.789 --> 04:17.791
-Initiate B-13.
-(alarm sounds)

04:17.825 --> 04:20.428
LaFREY:
Sir... B-13? No, no.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.729
That-that won't be necessary.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.196
ROMSLO: You have no idea
what's necessary.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.599
My responsibility is the safety
of the public.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.868
B-13 is initiated.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.638
You have 30 minutes
to eliminate the threat.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.640
Sir, please.
That's not enough time.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.208
(alarm continues sounding)

04:35.242 --> 04:36.944
MECHANIZED VOICE:
Lockdown initiated.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.880
Remain in your office.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.583
Protocol B-13 initiated.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.552
Remain in your office.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.387
Protocol B-13 initiated.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.422
-What is B-13?
-The Bureau is sealed off.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.458
If we don't find and kill this
thing in the next 30 minutes,

04:50.491 --> 04:51.959
everything in here gets
incinerated.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.628
-Wait, what?
-I don't want to burn to death.

04:54.662 --> 04:55.896
I want to die in my sleep,
butt-naked.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.064
LaFREY:
All right, listen up. Leroy.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.566
You and Annie start
tracking the target.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.234
Barry, you and Max get
into that lab, figure out what

05:01.268 --> 05:03.771
this thing is and how
to kill it. And, guys,

05:03.804 --> 05:05.806
remember what we do here today,

05:05.839 --> 05:07.941
we do for Bob.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.010
-I will be...
-JACE: Sorry to interrupt,

05:10.043 --> 05:11.579
but security guy
wouldn't let me leave,

05:11.612 --> 05:14.114
and I came down the back
elevator. Now I'm lost.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.917
I will be helping Jace,
the water delivery man,

05:16.950 --> 05:18.652
because we have nothing
to hide from him.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.488
It's a totally normal day.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.356
So, go ahead and go.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.991
-Let's go.
-LEROY: Can't believe she lets

05:24.024 --> 05:25.426
the water guy come down here.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.628
Uh, Jace, please, come on in.

05:30.531 --> 05:33.801
Okay, this sensor detects
any non-human DNA.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.537
If the creature comes within
15 feet, it'll start to beep.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.906
What's up with you and Max?

05:38.939 --> 05:41.208
What? What are you even
talking about?

05:41.241 --> 05:42.342
I have a boyfriend.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.011
Who, free throw guy?

05:44.044 --> 05:45.546
My sense is that's been
over for a while,

05:45.579 --> 05:47.314
-and neither one of you
wants to say it. -(scoffs)

05:47.347 --> 05:50.584
Okay, you are wrong, and that is
so none of your business.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.252
And besides, how would you know?

05:52.285 --> 05:53.320
Annie, I'm a detective.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.222
I detect things all the time.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.525
Even in my co-workers'
relationships.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.159
-It's almost a curse.
-Okay.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.394
Why are we even
talking about this?

06:00.428 --> 06:02.596
There is a predator
in the building.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.898
On the force,
when we were in a shootout,

06:04.932 --> 06:06.600
it was best to talk
about something else

06:06.634 --> 06:08.235
to keep your mind
off the danger.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.003
You seem pissed at me now,

06:10.037 --> 06:12.205
but you don't seem
nervous anymore.

06:12.239 --> 06:15.476
Huh. Well, I guess you're right.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.144
Plus, I love juicy gossip.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.146
Still nothing.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.549
Those samples
Bob took before he, uh...

06:21.582 --> 06:23.383
Got all the skin
sucked off his head

06:23.417 --> 06:25.853
and stayed alive for, like,
a full minute afterwards?

06:27.421 --> 06:29.189
Yeah. Could you bring those
over here, please?

06:31.659 --> 06:34.061
What's it like working
with a certified badass

06:34.094 --> 06:35.729
like Leroy every day?

06:35.763 --> 06:37.230
Are you just like, "Wow"?

06:37.264 --> 06:39.399
I mean, uh, you know,
Leroy's great.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.469
Lucky to be working with him.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.236
Uh, are you downplaying it
so I won't feel jealous?

06:43.270 --> 06:45.238
Because it's not working.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.407
I'm answering honestly.
I love working with Leroy.

06:47.441 --> 06:50.310
We make a great team. He...

06:50.343 --> 06:52.312
(mumbling)

06:52.345 --> 06:54.848
Bob really admired Leroy.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.216
Bob's dead, Barry.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.251
Okay?

06:59.419 --> 07:01.221
Yeah.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.157
-Let's, uh, continue working,
all right? -Yes.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.727
LaFREY: Sorry about
all of the confusion,

07:06.760 --> 07:09.897
but it's kind of... lucky.

07:09.930 --> 07:13.801
'Cause, uh, you've just been
doing such a terrific job

07:13.834 --> 07:16.069
that I'm actually thinking

07:16.103 --> 07:18.572
-of putting in a few more
water coolers. -Really?

07:18.606 --> 07:20.073
I mean, that sort of thing
normally goes

07:20.107 --> 07:21.441
through our sales team.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.777
Something tells me
that you can handle it.

07:23.811 --> 07:26.547
It's rare that I meet someone as
passionate about water as I am.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.715
MECHANIZED VOICE:
25 minutes remaining.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.016
That's the countdown

07:29.049 --> 07:30.350
for our lunch break.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.620
Maybe we could
have lunch together?

07:32.653 --> 07:34.622
Well, I'd like that, Jace.
I would.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.724
Uh, tell you what,
I want you to stay here,

07:36.757 --> 07:39.459
and, uh, you draw up
a, uh, proposal,

07:39.493 --> 07:40.894
and then I'll come back

07:40.928 --> 07:42.462
and we can go over
the numbers together.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.166
(laughing):
Okay.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.370
(creature rattling)

07:50.403 --> 07:54.441
Shag, Marry, Kill:
me, Leroy, yourself?

07:54.474 --> 07:57.678
Barry, even if I wanted to play,
that list is too weird.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.747
You find anything?

07:59.780 --> 08:04.785
Oh, yes. I found a report
on a similar creature,

08:04.818 --> 08:07.487
basically wiping out
the city of Galway in 1973.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.422
Pretty gruesome.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.158
Nothing about how
they killed it, though.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.126
Hold on.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.565
Oh, my God.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.499
Yeah, I know.
It's a pretty cool microscope.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.334
-It makes little thing...
-I have to talk to Leroy

08:21.368 --> 08:23.003
-and Annie right now.
-No. Y-Your phone won't work.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.105
They jam the signal
during lockdown.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.340
Okay, well, we have to warn them
not to shoot it.

08:27.374 --> 08:28.909
They cannot shoot it.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.747
Wendy Williams teaches us
that change is not only natural,

08:33.781 --> 08:35.282
it's inevitable.

08:35.315 --> 08:36.917
Relationships are
like the ocean...

08:36.950 --> 08:38.285
-(device beeping)
-It's close.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.255
(panting)

08:48.562 --> 08:49.930
(device stops beeping)

08:49.963 --> 08:53.233
Wait. What happened?

08:53.266 --> 08:55.603
What is it?

08:55.636 --> 08:57.070
-Um...
-What is it?

08:57.104 --> 08:59.439
Hold on.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.540
(creature rattling)

09:00.574 --> 09:02.876
ANNIE:
It's behind us.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.645
(creature snarling)

09:06.046 --> 09:07.247
ANNIE:
There it is! Get it!

09:08.782 --> 09:10.317
(creature screeches)

09:11.151 --> 09:12.886
LEROY:
I'm out.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.055
-We need more firepower.
-ANNIE: Come with me!

09:15.088 --> 09:17.925
Am I crazy, or did that thing
smell really good?

09:20.761 --> 09:21.795
(screeches)

09:28.736 --> 09:30.370
BARRY: What are you doing
with a tranquilizer gun?

09:30.403 --> 09:32.372
The cells of that creature
were able to regenerate

09:32.405 --> 09:34.174
at an incredibly fast rate,

09:34.207 --> 09:37.477
so if that organism is divided
in any way...

09:37.510 --> 09:39.212
They could create a new
independent organism.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.413
That's exactly right.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.683
Ah. We need to get the
tranquilizer gun to Leroy

09:42.716 --> 09:44.217
and let the big man
do his thang.

09:44.251 --> 09:47.187
Yeah, or we can take care of it
ourselves.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.056
No, no, no, no, no. That
doesn't sound like something

09:49.089 --> 09:51.558
-guys like us would do.
-Well, I'm not like you.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.993
I'm like, you know, I'm more...

09:53.026 --> 09:54.995
sort of...

09:55.028 --> 09:58.365
You're kind of a...
you know... it's...

09:58.398 --> 10:00.167
MECHANIZED VOICE:
20 minutes remaining.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.501
Look, let's just go.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.771
I'll come up with a nice way of
saying it on the walk.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.372
-Come on.
-Okay.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.107
What the hell was that thing?

10:07.140 --> 10:08.742
I've never seen anything
like that.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.577
Dating Max would be
completely inappropriate.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.612
I mean, we work together
and he's married.

10:12.646 --> 10:15.015
What? I thought you didn't want
to talk about it.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.349
Well, I don't want to die
with you thinking

10:16.383 --> 10:17.751
that I'm some
sort of home-wrecker.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.286
Well, Max's wife

10:19.319 --> 10:21.621
is an insane fugitive
who slammed his head

10:21.655 --> 10:23.657
and disappeared
for a second time,

10:23.691 --> 10:24.792
so I think that home is wrecked.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.727
Hoping he finds a slightly
better situation.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.595
Well, that's sweet that
you're worried about him.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.098
I'm not worried
about him, specifically.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.566
I-I love everybody.
I got a big heart.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.469
Well, it doesn't matter, anyway,
because I'm with Tad.

10:36.503 --> 10:37.738
Free throw guy's name is Tad?

10:37.771 --> 10:39.606
-Shut up.
-Okay.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.614
(whispering):
Yeah, the creature was here.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.990
Excuse me.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.828
Hello?

11:02.129 --> 11:03.330
(both screaming)

11:03.363 --> 11:05.132
Oh, my God.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.166
Oh, thank God!

11:06.199 --> 11:07.534
(screaming)

11:07.567 --> 11:08.702
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, God!

11:08.736 --> 11:09.970
Oh, God.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.806
That thing killed Evan.
It was horrible.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.141
Well, we're here now.
You're safe with us, okay?

11:14.174 --> 11:17.510
I know I am because
you are Leroy's partner,

11:17.544 --> 11:20.914
and as long as I'm with you,
he can protect all of us.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.350
Yeah, or I'll protect all of us

11:23.383 --> 11:26.219
because Leroy and I
are equally as good. Okay?

11:26.253 --> 11:28.221
(device beeping)

11:28.255 --> 11:30.490
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's
close. It's close. It's close.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.992
Okay, get behind me.
Get behind me. Get behind me.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.126
Okay. Shh, shh, shh.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.031
Oh, my God, I got to work out.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.569
Come on.

11:42.602 --> 11:43.771
DONNY:
Where are we going?

11:43.804 --> 11:45.038
BARRY:
Shh. Shh, shh.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.208
(creature growling, rattling)

11:48.241 --> 11:51.078
Oh. Oh. Oh, God.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.883
(whispering):
Okay. Okay, you can do this.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.886
You're a badass.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.988
One...

12:01.021 --> 12:03.056
two...

12:03.090 --> 12:05.058
-three...
-(elevator bell dings)

12:05.092 --> 12:07.194
Not bad.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.366
Stop shooting!
You can't shoot it!

12:13.400 --> 12:14.601
MAX:
I got it!

12:16.703 --> 12:18.738
Oops.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.407
-(creature roaring)
-ANNIE: Leroy!

12:20.440 --> 12:21.741
Don't shoot! You can't shoot it!

12:21.775 --> 12:23.911
-ANNIE: Why not?
-I'll tell you later.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.678
Let's get him in the elevator.
Grab his legs.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.347
-Donny, come on.
-Help us!

12:27.380 --> 12:29.349
-Oh!
-Leroy, wake up.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.618
-Oh, my God. -Max, why did
you... -(creature rattling)

12:35.455 --> 12:37.390
Oh, I think
I'm gonna pee myself.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.092
Mm, there it is.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.639
-(screeches)
-BARRY: It's not working.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.407
-He's immune.
-(screeching)

12:54.441 --> 12:56.243
Ooh! Whoa!

12:56.276 --> 12:57.544
(all shouting)

13:03.116 --> 13:04.417
Go! Go! Go!

13:04.451 --> 13:06.954
(all shouting)

13:08.755 --> 13:10.057
Oh, my God, I peed myself.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.424
I'm a grown-ass man,
I peed myself!

13:12.325 --> 13:14.427
Stop, Donny!

13:14.461 --> 13:15.896
-I'm not dying for y'all!
-No, no, no, no, no!

13:15.929 --> 13:17.630
You're not even a part
of my main office clique!

13:17.664 --> 13:19.933
(screeches)

13:19.967 --> 13:22.135
-(Donny screaming,
bones cracking) -Whoa!

13:24.471 --> 13:26.473
Go! Go! Go! Go!

13:26.506 --> 13:27.908
Get him in, come on.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.409
BARRY:
Okay.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.078
-One, two, three and plop.
-(gasps)

13:31.111 --> 13:34.081
-(panting)
-Oh, there he is. Hey, buddy.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.382
-Hello.
-You shot me!

13:35.415 --> 13:36.783
Okay, I know it
appears that way,

13:36.816 --> 13:38.285
and is that way,

13:38.318 --> 13:39.786
but it's actually
kind of a good thing,

13:39.819 --> 13:41.788
because firing on that monster,

13:41.821 --> 13:44.291
it could have created
a-a bunch of little monsters.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.126
So, I should thank you
for shooting me?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.494
'Cause it seemed like something
you could have just told me.

13:47.527 --> 13:48.495
Well, maybe I would have

13:48.528 --> 13:49.997
if you didn't just start

13:50.030 --> 13:51.798
blasting everything in sight,
just so everyone

13:51.831 --> 13:53.833
would call you
this big, tough, cool guy.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.802
Stop trying to do my thing.
Do your thing.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.871
Use that big, freaky brain
of yours

13:57.905 --> 13:59.272
to come up with some
dumb-sounding plan.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.141
ANNIE:
Well, okay. Okay, hold on.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.176
Just take a second. You're still
woozy from the tranquilizer.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.312
I-I'll splash some water
on your face.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.014
Do not put toilet water
on my face.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.715
What do... What's wrong?
It's clean water.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.317
Do you not know
what happens in toilets?

14:10.350 --> 14:11.851
The amount of times you flush,

14:11.885 --> 14:13.620
the water just cleans
itself out, doesn't it?

14:13.653 --> 14:15.889
You're not putting poop water
on my face.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.091
-Everybody knows that toilet
water's very clean. -LEROY: No.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.526
Oh. That's weird.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.028
The bowl's empty.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.495
I-It's been sucked dry.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.601
Yep. This one's dry, too.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.870
The monster was coming
from this direction.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.839
BARRY: And it killed Bob
after he spilled his beverage.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.208
And Donny
after he peed his pants.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.709
It's hunting for liquid.

14:36.743 --> 14:39.046
I mean, it must be some
sort of aquatic creature.

14:39.079 --> 14:42.382
It needs massive amounts
of fluid to survive.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.952
Max, what's going on in that
big, freaky brain of yours?

14:46.419 --> 14:48.421
A dumb-sounding plan.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.031
Sorry, but can I say
one more thing...

14:58.065 --> 15:01.068
No. I am under
a lot of pressure right now,

15:01.101 --> 15:03.570
and I will be damned
if I spend one more second

15:03.603 --> 15:05.738
dealing with water.

15:05.772 --> 15:07.640
We need water.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.142
We need to get all of the water
in the building

15:09.176 --> 15:11.644
-into one room.
-We need to do it fast.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.347
Really fast.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.983
Jace, you got this?

15:17.450 --> 15:19.652
Time me.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.095
That's the last of it.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.130
MECHANIZED VOICE:
Seven minutes remaining.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.065
Barry? Max? Are we ready?

15:32.099 --> 15:34.067
Yes. Uh, we've recalibrated
the radiation waves

15:34.101 --> 15:36.403
coming off this machine to
effectively transform this room

15:36.436 --> 15:38.538
-into a humongous microwave.
-MAX: Yeah.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.540
So, the creature is attracted
to moisture, right?

15:40.573 --> 15:42.275
So he's gonna come in,
follow the bait,

15:42.309 --> 15:44.777
and then, we can
instantly dehydrate him.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.013
We hope. All right.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.447
Everyone ready?

15:47.480 --> 15:48.581
(clicking)

15:48.615 --> 15:50.450
Whoa. Hold on.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.585
D-Did you just say "creature"?

15:52.619 --> 15:54.854
What creature?
Why does a coat hanger company

15:54.887 --> 15:57.090
have a giant x-ray mach...

15:58.691 --> 15:59.892
I probably should've
done that earlier.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.194
LEROY:
That was cool.

16:01.228 --> 16:02.629
I was thinking we were gonna
have to kill him,

16:02.662 --> 16:04.597
but this is better.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.633
(creature growling)

16:08.935 --> 16:10.803
Come on.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.707
-Go in there.
-Okay...

16:14.741 --> 16:16.743
-(screeching)
-LaFREY: Okay, Barry, now.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.811
-Press it! Press it! Barry,
Barry. -Do it, do it.

16:18.845 --> 16:19.912
-Press the button. -Press it,
Barry. -Do it, do it!

16:19.946 --> 16:21.381
-Do it! Do it!
-Press the button.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.383
I'm pressing it.
It's not doing anything!

16:23.416 --> 16:24.917
-Why the hell not?
-Okay, it might be possible

16:24.951 --> 16:26.086
after Max and I adjusted
the settings,

16:26.119 --> 16:27.487
I may have possibly
forgotten to...

16:27.520 --> 16:29.922
Forgotten to turn
the machine back on?

16:29.956 --> 16:31.858
-No more donuts until
we survive this thing. -Okay.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.260
MECHANIZED VOICE:
Five minutes remaining.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.894
All right, all right.
Listen, listen.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.263
Someone needs to go in there.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.964
It's too risky.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.966
If it detects our moisture,
it will instantly attack us.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.401
Okay, so we need something

16:41.434 --> 16:42.869
t-that will hide us.

16:42.902 --> 16:43.903
We need something, uh,
super absorbent?

16:43.936 --> 16:44.871
Do you have any kind of

16:44.904 --> 16:46.373
advanced drying technology?

16:46.406 --> 16:49.242
-I-I have, like, baby powder.
-Baby powder?

16:49.276 --> 16:50.343
Are you sure that'll work?

16:50.377 --> 16:52.245
No. Not at all.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.882
(sighing)

16:55.915 --> 16:57.650
I'll do it.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.052
No, Max. You're trying
to do my thing again.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.687
I'll go.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.355
Well, I'm not gonna let you
go in there alone.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.524
Okay, just to be clear, this is
very much a one-person job.

17:04.557 --> 17:05.958
Not today, it's not.

17:07.094 --> 17:09.162
We'll go together.

17:09.196 --> 17:10.197
Let's do it.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.065
All three of us, then.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.766
Let's do this for Bob.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.735
-Barry, no. You're not
a part of this. -Sorry.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.404
We are gonna it for Bob, though.
That's a good call.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.472
-I loved that guy.
-MAX: Listen.

17:19.506 --> 17:20.640
If you have to press that button

17:20.673 --> 17:22.041
while we're still in there,
you do it.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.710
-LEROY: What?
-MAX: Don't worry about it.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.378

Come on.

18:15.027 --> 18:16.596
Don't sneeze.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.899
Do not sneeze, Max.

18:25.004 --> 18:28.141
It's okay. There's just so much
baby powder. Let's go.

-Press the button, Barry!

18:37.284 --> 18:38.785
Press the button!

18:38.818 --> 18:40.253
Hurry! Barry!

18:48.828 --> 18:50.263
(shouting, laughing)

18:50.297 --> 18:52.765
Oh, my God, that really worked!

18:54.000 --> 18:55.168
You've earned this, Barry.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.603

-Yes!

18:56.636 --> 18:58.638

18:59.906 --> 19:01.408
-You were so cool!
-What about you?

19:01.441 --> 19:02.875
Flipping the switch
like a badass!

19:02.909 --> 19:04.477
-Aw, well... That was amazing!

19:07.247 --> 19:09.482
Wait a second.
Why didn't the clock stop?

Why hasn't the clock stopped?

19:20.960 --> 19:22.762

19:22.795 --> 19:24.564

20:01.167 --> 20:02.969
Barry, scrub out the microwave.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.438
Everyone else,

Hey.

Oh, hey.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.416

20:16.449 --> 20:17.517
Crazy day, huh?

20:17.550 --> 20:20.887
Yeah, that was, uh...

20:20.920 --> 20:22.889
Exactly what you said.
It was crazy.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.792
-(laughs)
-Yeah.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.395
-Well, I'm glad... What?
-You know...

20:28.428 --> 20:30.897
-Sorry. -(chuckles) No, go
ahead. What were you gonna say?

20:30.930 --> 20:32.465
-Ser... -No, no, no, no, no,
that's all right. What...

20:32.499 --> 20:34.701
-Go ahead.
-I was just gonna say

20:34.734 --> 20:38.371
that I'm glad you're okay.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.707
Thanks. Me, too.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.141
I mean, for you.

20:42.174 --> 20:43.242

20:43.276 --> 20:45.211
-Both of us. You know.
-Yeah...

20:45.244 --> 20:47.246
But I am glad you're okay.
(chuckles) It's...

20:47.280 --> 20:50.550
* Just listen to the rhythm
of my heart *

20:50.583 --> 20:52.519
* There's a chance
we could make it now *

20:52.552 --> 20:53.720
* We'll be rocking
till the sun goes down... *

20:53.753 --> 20:55.922
Yo, Annie banan-ie.

20:55.955 --> 20:59.191
* Ah, ooh...

20:59.225 --> 21:02.061
Got out early today, huh?
Must be nice.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.064
Yeah. Yeah.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.199
-What, do you have the day off,
too, or... -(chuckles)

21:07.233 --> 21:09.101
I wish. I'm always working.

21:09.135 --> 21:11.404
He has an idea for a magazine.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.406
Oh, cool.

-Okay.

21:15.975 --> 21:19.912
* You got me in a spin,
but everything is A-okay... *

21:19.946 --> 21:20.980
Peace.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.248
(engine roars)

21:26.319 --> 21:27.620
Good job today.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.422
Thanks, man. You, too.

21:29.456 --> 21:33.025
Hey, I guess you, uh,
believe in monsters now, huh?

21:33.059 --> 21:34.894
I believe in that monster.

21:34.927 --> 21:37.296
I still don't believe in aliens
and all your other crazy stuff.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.265
Okay. All right, well,
it's a start.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.837
I did see a bigfoot
when I was little, though.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.473
I'm sorry, what?

21:46.506 --> 21:50.777
-Way to bury the lede, man.
