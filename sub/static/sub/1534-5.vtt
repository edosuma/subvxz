00:01.879 --> 00:04.056
Previously on Once Upon A Time...

00:04.056 --> 00:04.961
It's Marian.

00:04.961 --> 00:06.730
He's honor-bound to stay with her.

00:06.865 --> 00:08.369
Therefore, I have to save her.

00:08.518 --> 00:09.852
Why the hell are you following me?!

00:09.887 --> 00:12.188
I'm starting to think maybe
it wasn't just some curse

00:12.222 --> 00:13.355
that brought her to Storybrooke.

00:13.390 --> 00:15.992
- Where is she?
- She's gone.

00:46.589 --> 00:47.589
Somewhere in here,

00:47.624 --> 00:49.691
there's got to be something on her.

00:49.726 --> 00:51.826
There has to be a better strategy.

00:51.860 --> 00:53.194
While we're reading files,

00:53.229 --> 00:55.396
my sister is out there somewhere.

00:55.431 --> 00:57.499
We have to confront this snow queen.

00:57.533 --> 00:59.434
Believe me, if I could, we
would. We have to find her first.

00:59.468 --> 01:02.737
And, Elsa, we have to be
careful. This woman is tricky.

01:02.771 --> 01:03.838
She seems to know both of us,

01:03.872 --> 01:05.173
and we don't remember anything about her.

01:05.206 --> 01:08.375
And something tells me that
that is not an accident.

01:08.409 --> 01:09.844
You think she took our memories?

01:09.878 --> 01:12.412
I'm really good with names
and faces. It was my job.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.682
She took them, all right.
The question is why.

01:14.716 --> 01:17.118
We need to find out
what the hell she's up to.

01:17.152 --> 01:18.285
Paperwork, ahoy!

01:18.319 --> 01:21.188
Old city records from the mayor's office,

01:21.222 --> 01:22.589
per your request.

01:22.624 --> 01:26.092
Oi! Somebody's
forgotten about me dinner!

01:26.127 --> 01:27.761
I had the bangers and mash.

01:27.795 --> 01:31.998
You had the water and pop-tart.

01:34.001 --> 01:36.903
Somebody's already had a nibble.

01:36.937 --> 01:38.438
I've had my shots.

01:38.473 --> 01:41.274
What a relief.

01:41.308 --> 01:43.943
Now, I've served me time.

01:43.978 --> 01:46.546
- So when will I be free?
- When I say so.

01:46.580 --> 01:51.551
Well... I'm off to take
Henry sailing, love,

01:51.585 --> 01:54.487
unless there's something
else you want me to do here.

01:54.521 --> 01:55.989
Make sure Henry wears his life vest, okay?

01:56.023 --> 01:58.991
Befriending the son to get in with the mum?

01:59.025 --> 02:01.894
Yep, no one will ever see through that.

02:01.928 --> 02:06.899
Why don't you keep your
thoughts to yourself... mate.

02:10.670 --> 02:14.206
Goodbye.

02:21.715 --> 02:24.016
Emma, look.

02:24.050 --> 02:26.451
Why are there pictures of you
mixed in with the city records?

02:26.485 --> 02:29.121
Let's just say when Regina was mayor,

02:29.155 --> 02:30.589
she abused her power a bit.

02:30.623 --> 02:33.425
She was looking for any
reason to run me out of town.

02:35.027 --> 02:37.128
That's the first time Henry
and I went for hot cocoa.

02:37.162 --> 02:39.660
When I walked him to
school for the first time.

02:43.711 --> 02:44.519
Emma?

02:44.519 --> 02:45.952
What is it?

02:47.788 --> 02:50.023
It's me and her.

02:51.825 --> 02:54.327
And you still don't remember any of this?

02:54.362 --> 02:55.661
No, but I know someone who may...

02:55.696 --> 02:57.563
The person who had the photos taken.

03:03.756 --> 03:05.884
Please tell me you've found her.

03:06.248 --> 03:07.715
And which "her" would that be?

03:07.750 --> 03:09.751
Snow white? Maid Marian?

03:09.785 --> 03:11.085
Emma Swan?

03:11.119 --> 03:15.423
It's so hard to keep track
of her majesty's nemeses.

03:15.457 --> 03:17.692
I'm not in the mood for games, Sidney.

03:17.726 --> 03:21.395
I need to know where
the snow queen is hiding.

03:21.429 --> 03:26.200
If I can't unfreeze Marian myself,

03:26.234 --> 03:28.035
I'll force her to do it.

03:28.069 --> 03:30.537
Haven't come across the snow queen yet,

03:30.571 --> 03:31.705
sorry to say.

03:31.739 --> 03:33.573
Then you have a new task.

03:33.608 --> 03:36.576
Find that snow queen.

03:36.611 --> 03:39.413
Or you'll learn what
sorry really feels like.

03:39.447 --> 03:42.783
Yes, your majesty.

03:44.652 --> 03:46.119
Shh.

03:46.153 --> 03:48.888
See... Belle's a natural.

03:48.923 --> 03:50.557
She's got all the emergency numbers.

03:50.591 --> 03:52.359
If anything happens, Neal will be okay.

03:52.393 --> 03:55.128
I'm not worried about
emergency numbers, David.

03:55.162 --> 03:57.530
I'm nervous about leaving him at all.

03:57.564 --> 03:58.865
Between the curse and the wicked witch,

03:58.899 --> 04:01.134
we don't exactly have the best
track record with our babies.

04:01.168 --> 04:03.769
He is going to be fine.

04:03.804 --> 04:07.373
And we need this time away. You need it.

04:07.407 --> 04:09.475
Hey. So what do you say?

04:09.509 --> 04:11.777
You ready for our evening stroll?

04:24.424 --> 04:25.758
You okay?

04:27.160 --> 04:28.793
It's just the pictures.

04:28.828 --> 04:30.628
Reminds me of when I first got here.

04:30.663 --> 04:33.131
Regina and I hated each other.

04:33.166 --> 04:36.268
Well, "hate" might be the
wrong word, but we did not mix.

04:36.302 --> 04:38.670
But it seems like you've
come a long way since then.

04:38.704 --> 04:41.506
Yeah, but it looks like
we're right back at it.

04:41.540 --> 04:44.576
Just wish I could fix it. Coming?

04:44.610 --> 04:46.911
I think this sounds like

04:46.945 --> 04:50.248
something you two should talk about alone.

04:50.282 --> 04:53.251
You know, if things were getting
better between you two before,

04:53.285 --> 04:54.486
maybe they can again.

04:54.520 --> 04:57.154
Doubt it. I screwed her over.

04:57.189 --> 04:59.090
Once you screw someone over,
there's no getting them back.

04:59.124 --> 05:01.425
What makes you say that?

05:01.459 --> 05:03.460
Experience.

05:38.695 --> 05:39.862
Whoa.

05:41.165 --> 05:42.632
What you got there?

05:42.666 --> 05:45.568
I've been looking all over for you.

05:45.602 --> 05:46.836
Just go with it.

05:48.072 --> 05:51.541
Thanks for hanging on to
that till I got us a cart.

05:51.575 --> 05:53.543
You two girls are on your own?

05:53.577 --> 05:55.210
My parents are outside in the car.

05:55.245 --> 05:57.279
They sent us to grab a few things.

05:59.716 --> 06:01.050
Okay.

06:02.619 --> 06:05.087
Thanks. That
was about to get ugly.

06:05.121 --> 06:06.588
Yeah, no kidding.

06:06.622 --> 06:07.789
You know, the whole

06:07.824 --> 06:10.125
"stuffing things under your
shirt" move never works.

06:10.160 --> 06:13.462
You need one of these.

06:13.496 --> 06:16.686
Lift some plastic, and you can
buy whatever you want.

06:18.168 --> 06:20.802
I'll remember that next time.

06:20.837 --> 06:22.571
Wait!

06:22.605 --> 06:25.340
You're part of my cover now.

06:25.374 --> 06:30.545
So what do you say?
You want to go shopping?

06:32.582 --> 06:35.550
Wow. That actually worked.

06:35.585 --> 06:37.552
Hold onto your bag and run.

06:37.587 --> 06:39.720
- What? Why?
- Trust me.

06:39.754 --> 06:43.057
Go! Go! Go!

06:43.092 --> 06:44.058
Hey!

06:53.635 --> 06:55.268
Come on! This way!

07:10.919 --> 07:12.719
I'm Emma, by the way.

07:12.753 --> 07:15.055
Lily. Thanks for the help.

07:15.089 --> 07:17.891
You had my back, and I got yours.

07:23.364 --> 07:26.666
Ms. Swan. What an unpleasant surprise.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.668
Unfortunately, I'm a little busy

07:28.702 --> 07:31.838
trying to save my true love's wife.

07:31.872 --> 07:34.574
- Or hadn't you heard?
- What do you know about these?

07:37.344 --> 07:40.847
It appears you and the
snow queen are old friends.

07:40.881 --> 07:43.016
Well, frenemies at best.

07:43.050 --> 07:45.384
I have zero memories of this conversation.

07:45.419 --> 07:46.685
I was hoping you might.

07:46.719 --> 07:49.921
Sidney took these when
you had him spying on me.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.068
He didn't say anything
about what was going on here?

07:52.068 --> 07:53.959
Or why I was arguing with the snow queen?

07:53.993 --> 07:55.428
He never mentioned anything.

07:55.462 --> 07:58.597
My guess... you skipped the tip jar.

07:58.631 --> 07:59.831
I suppose I should talk to Sidney, then.

07:59.866 --> 08:02.333
But no one seems to know where he is.

08:02.368 --> 08:03.535
Have you seen him?

08:03.570 --> 08:06.538
I've been busy working on Marian,

08:06.573 --> 08:08.139
on the problem you created.

08:08.174 --> 08:12.477
I guess I'll let you get back to it.

08:12.511 --> 08:15.380
Any progress on thawing her out?

08:15.414 --> 08:17.848
It's no concern of yours.

08:17.883 --> 08:18.983
It could be.

08:19.017 --> 08:22.153
I know I'm not sorceress of the year,

08:22.188 --> 08:24.989
but if you want some extra
juice to undo the spell,

08:25.023 --> 08:26.157
let me know.

08:26.192 --> 08:29.227
Are you offering to help me?

08:29.261 --> 08:31.563
Despite everything, you've done
a lot for me, Regina, so yeah.

08:31.597 --> 08:32.897
You've had my back,

08:32.931 --> 08:34.364
and I want you to know that I have yours.

08:35.533 --> 08:38.703
Ms. Swan, one thing's abundantly clear.

08:38.736 --> 08:43.373
You've never had my back.

08:43.408 --> 08:44.809
And you never will.

08:52.984 --> 08:55.986
Elsa.

08:58.590 --> 09:01.091
Elsa?

09:03.628 --> 09:06.130
Elsa, help!

09:12.202 --> 09:13.169
Anna?

09:13.203 --> 09:17.440
Elsa. Help me.

09:29.939 --> 09:30.941
Elsa?!

09:33.820 --> 09:34.722
Elsa!

09:44.049 --> 09:45.756
My queen, I have news.

09:46.413 --> 09:48.713
I have found the snow queen's lair.

09:48.748 --> 09:50.649
Well, where is it?

09:50.683 --> 09:55.887
I think a little quid pro
quo is in order, don't you?

09:55.922 --> 09:57.556
I'm growing tired of this glass prison.

09:57.590 --> 10:00.058
Let's see if your
information yields results.

10:00.092 --> 10:02.627
Then we can discuss your freedom.

10:02.662 --> 10:04.128
You expect me to give up my leverage

10:04.163 --> 10:06.465
before I've received anything in return?

10:07.834 --> 10:09.968
Do you think me an imbecile?

10:10.002 --> 10:12.903
I think I've trapped you in a mirror twice.

10:12.938 --> 10:15.573
And if you find them too constricting,

10:15.607 --> 10:17.208
well, then...

10:17.242 --> 10:20.511
Perhaps you'd like to return
to your cell at the hospital.

10:22.214 --> 10:24.015
Upon further reflection,

10:24.049 --> 10:26.750
it appears I don't have
the leverage I thought.

10:26.785 --> 10:30.688
Listen closely. I will lead you to her.

10:33.859 --> 10:35.493
And I need one of the good walkies,

10:35.527 --> 10:37.895
not one of the short-range
things you let Henry play with.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.062
It's a short hike to the bluffs.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.330
We'll be gone less than an hour.

10:40.365 --> 10:41.832
With no cell reception!

10:41.867 --> 10:43.900
I want to be sure Belle can reach us.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.768
Or you're looking for a way out of this.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.672
- We are going on this hike.
- Yes!

10:49.707 --> 10:51.574
And we shall be reachable.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.515
This will do it. I'll call Belle.

10:58.549 --> 11:00.517
Let her know where to
find our walkie at home.

11:00.551 --> 11:03.352
Now she'll be able to reach
us on our drive, our hike...

11:03.387 --> 11:07.390
If we fall through a portal
to asgard wherever we are.

11:07.424 --> 11:10.459
My hero.

11:10.494 --> 11:12.061
Hmm.

11:13.831 --> 11:15.464
Hang on.

11:15.499 --> 11:16.798
What is it?

11:16.833 --> 11:18.634
You know that thief I told you about?

11:18.668 --> 11:20.802
The one who ran from
the ice-cream shop?

11:20.837 --> 11:24.073
Will Scarlet.

11:24.107 --> 11:28.077
Looks like he managed a jail break.

11:28.111 --> 11:29.811
Come on. Let's go.

11:29.846 --> 11:32.048
Wait. Oh, you mean right now?

11:32.082 --> 11:33.181
Oh, come on. It'll be like old times.

11:33.215 --> 11:34.850
A prince and a princess on an adventure,

11:34.884 --> 11:37.853
but without the evil queen on our trail.

11:45.028 --> 11:47.829
I'm walking due north. Now what?

11:47.864 --> 11:51.166
Head past the toll bridge, then go east.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.667
The snow queen isn't far.

11:58.941 --> 12:00.908
Regina.

12:00.943 --> 12:03.586
- What are you doing here?
- Elsa disappeared on me.

12:03.733 --> 12:05.514
I think she went to go confront
the snow queen on her own.

12:05.854 --> 12:07.988
Afraid she's in trouble.

12:08.022 --> 12:10.545
How about you?
Nature walks your new thing?

12:10.545 --> 12:12.456
I intend to force the snow queen's hand,

12:13.214 --> 12:15.716
make her reverse the damage
she's inflicted on Marian.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.684
How do you even know where she is?

12:17.719 --> 12:20.521
Explaining my magic to a
beginner is a waste of my time.

12:20.555 --> 12:22.022
She's east of the toll bridge.

12:22.056 --> 12:24.690
Well, I think we should
stick together, then.

12:24.725 --> 12:26.192
My best shot at finding Elsa

12:26.227 --> 12:27.960
is to go in the direction
of the snow queen.

12:27.995 --> 12:30.930
You don't mind the company, do you?

12:30.964 --> 12:33.266
Does it matter if I mind?

12:33.300 --> 12:36.636
If I say no, you'll just come anyway.

12:39.105 --> 12:42.608
Mm!

12:42.643 --> 12:45.945
That sandwich isn't
going anywhere, you know.

12:45.979 --> 12:47.947
Sorry.

12:47.981 --> 12:50.282
It's just that where I come
from, if you don't eat fast,

12:50.316 --> 12:52.284
the big kids would swipe
things off your plate.

12:52.318 --> 12:54.820
Was that around here?

12:54.855 --> 12:56.321
Boston.

12:56.356 --> 12:59.491
Snuck out in the middle of
the night and hopped a bus.

13:01.093 --> 13:03.162
Why did you leave?

13:03.196 --> 13:08.500
This little girl from my
home, Cecilia, got adopted.

13:08.535 --> 13:11.002
I watched her get in
this station wagon

13:11.037 --> 13:14.105
with this perfect-looking couple.

13:14.139 --> 13:16.307
That's when I realized...

13:16.341 --> 13:18.109
No one was ever gonna look at me

13:18.143 --> 13:20.612
the way those parents looked at her.

13:20.646 --> 13:24.449
I'm too old. I missed my chance.

13:24.483 --> 13:26.384
There was no point
in me staying another day

13:26.418 --> 13:28.019
if I was just gonna keep feeling...

13:28.054 --> 13:30.154
Invisible?

13:31.823 --> 13:35.293
I know what it's like to live someplace

13:35.299 --> 13:37.294
where it feels like no one cares about you,

13:37.294 --> 13:39.830
let alone understands you.

13:40.770 --> 13:42.766
Were you in a home, too?

13:45.203 --> 13:48.839
That guy chasing you...
is he from social services?

13:48.873 --> 13:51.041
Is he trying to take you back?

13:52.920 --> 13:54.044
Yeah.

13:54.079 --> 13:56.680
What are you gonna do?

14:00.106 --> 14:02.051
See those houses over there?

14:02.086 --> 14:04.321
People use them in the summer.

14:04.355 --> 14:06.490
But now that it's fall, they'll be empty.

14:06.524 --> 14:10.160
I figured I'll pick the nicest one

14:10.194 --> 14:12.895
and I'll crash there for a while.

14:12.930 --> 14:15.732
Here's an idea.

14:17.660 --> 14:19.135
Come with me.

14:19.169 --> 14:21.904
- Really?
- Why not?

14:21.939 --> 14:24.140
We'd be better off if we stuck together.

14:32.215 --> 14:34.183
Anna!

14:34.217 --> 14:36.685
Anna!

14:49.032 --> 14:51.366
Elsa!

14:53.970 --> 14:57.773
Don't move! I'll be right there!

15:17.259 --> 15:19.194
Help! Please!

15:33.243 --> 15:35.663
I should be home with Neal,
not chasing after some thief.

15:35.823 --> 15:37.957
Let's just give it a little while longer.

15:37.991 --> 15:39.125
We've been out for an hour!

15:39.159 --> 15:40.492
That's longer than I've been away

15:40.527 --> 15:41.828
from the baby since he was born.

15:41.862 --> 15:43.830
David, I think that's
a pretty good start.

15:43.864 --> 15:46.165
All right, all right. You're right.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.834
You head home...

15:48.868 --> 15:51.002
And I'll deal with this.

16:09.188 --> 16:12.190
Oh, I'm probably wrong.

16:18.597 --> 16:21.399
Oh, no, I'm not.

16:21.433 --> 16:23.434
Which way?

16:23.469 --> 16:24.769
Right.

16:24.803 --> 16:26.103
Is this a locator spell?

16:26.137 --> 16:27.271
Shouldn't we be following some,

16:27.305 --> 16:29.073
like, floaty object or something?

16:29.107 --> 16:30.575
Oh, now you're a magic expert.

16:30.609 --> 16:32.410
No, it's just, in the
past, there was a...

16:32.444 --> 16:35.580
There are many enchantments
you have yet to be exposed to.

16:35.614 --> 16:37.581
If you bothered to study
your craft, you'd know that.

16:37.615 --> 16:38.916
I'm kind of learning as I go.

16:38.950 --> 16:40.251
It's not like there's
a lot of online classes

16:40.285 --> 16:42.253
on this kind of thing.

16:42.287 --> 16:45.422
But when you helped me, I
seemed to learn pretty fast.

16:45.456 --> 16:48.092
I don't have time for lessons.

16:48.126 --> 16:50.261
I know. I know you're busy.

16:50.295 --> 16:53.263
And so you know, I think it's
admirable, what you're doing.

16:53.297 --> 16:55.031
Helping the wife of the man you love.

16:57.602 --> 17:01.070
So I've impressed you?

17:01.105 --> 17:03.973
Well it makes it all
worthwhile then, doesn't it?

17:04.008 --> 17:05.474
Why are you doing that?

17:05.510 --> 17:08.412
I was just trying to give you
credit. I'm trying to be nice.

17:08.445 --> 17:12.248
And then what? Complimenting my outfits?

17:12.282 --> 17:14.416
Giving me a makeover? Braiding my hair?

17:14.451 --> 17:16.152
Calling Robin Hood and hanging up?

17:16.185 --> 17:21.391
You're trying to win me over
so I can assuage your guilt

17:21.425 --> 17:24.227
intentionally or not, Ms. Swan,

17:24.261 --> 17:26.395
you brought Marian back.

17:26.430 --> 17:28.063
You ruined my life.

17:28.097 --> 17:29.965
And there is no coming back from that.

17:29.999 --> 17:34.904
Because I know you
think you didn't mean to,

17:34.938 --> 17:37.940
but you hurt someone.

17:39.876 --> 17:42.677
So do as I do...

17:42.711 --> 17:44.212
Learn to live with it.

17:46.449 --> 17:48.783
Welcome to my world.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.332
Not too shabby, huh?

18:07.202 --> 18:08.369
I'm gonna beat you!

18:08.403 --> 18:10.004
- No!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:10.038 --> 18:12.039
Yes! Yes! Yes!

18:12.074 --> 18:14.008
No!

18:14.042 --> 18:16.177
- Game over.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

18:16.211 --> 18:17.211
Aw.

18:17.245 --> 18:19.981
Yes. Oh, I suck at this!

18:20.015 --> 18:22.984
- Haven't you ever played before?
- No.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.486
I've never lived in a place
that could afford one of these.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.322
You'll get the hang of it.

18:28.357 --> 18:31.058
- You hungry?
- Whoa.

18:31.093 --> 18:32.893
What happened?

18:32.927 --> 18:35.829
Oh, I... I don't know.

18:35.864 --> 18:38.031
I've had this since I can remember.

18:38.065 --> 18:40.367
I like to pretend it's some kind of symbol,

18:40.401 --> 18:42.168
like Harry Potter or something.

18:43.538 --> 18:46.974
Like you're one-of-a-kind,
like you're special.

18:47.008 --> 18:49.909
I know it's stupid.

18:49.943 --> 18:51.711
No, it's not.

18:57.885 --> 18:59.685
Okay.

18:59.720 --> 19:03.056
Then you are special, too.

19:06.393 --> 19:08.193
Thanks.

19:12.198 --> 19:16.736
Hey! Check this out!

19:31.284 --> 19:35.087
Let's promise to stay friends, okay?

19:35.121 --> 19:36.221
No matter what,

19:36.256 --> 19:38.356
there won't be anything
we can't come back from.

19:38.390 --> 19:42.360
Okay. Yeah.

19:42.394 --> 19:44.062
Promise.

19:44.096 --> 19:46.297
For real?

19:46.331 --> 19:49.601
For real.

19:49.635 --> 19:51.603
Anna!

19:51.637 --> 19:54.638
- Anna!
- Elsa!

20:05.984 --> 20:07.751
I was so worried I'd never find you.

20:07.786 --> 20:11.589
But I'm so glad you did.

20:11.623 --> 20:14.257
You stay away from us.

20:14.292 --> 20:17.895
It's okay, Anna. I won't let her hurt you.

20:31.550 --> 20:32.632
Where's Anna?

20:32.843 --> 20:34.944
What did you do?

20:34.979 --> 20:37.114
I'm sorry for all the theater,

20:37.148 --> 20:40.450
but she was never really here, sweetheart.

20:40.485 --> 20:45.154
An icy illusion because... I needed you.

20:45.188 --> 20:46.623
For what?

20:49.793 --> 20:51.260
Look at yourself.

20:51.294 --> 20:53.362
So much fear.

20:53.396 --> 20:57.934
Imagine what you could do if
you only learned to control it.

20:57.968 --> 21:00.269
You had a chance to do so once,

21:00.303 --> 21:03.439
but... you squandered it.

21:03.473 --> 21:07.476
Fortunately for me,

21:07.511 --> 21:10.513
the more frightened you are,

21:10.547 --> 21:13.516
the stronger those chains will hold.

21:13.550 --> 21:17.519
And that's all I need for now...

21:17.553 --> 21:20.455
you out of my way.

21:22.591 --> 21:25.393
I would tell you

21:25.427 --> 21:28.897
that everything is going to be fine,

21:28.931 --> 21:32.233
that I won't hurt you,

21:32.268 --> 21:37.405
but your worry, your fear,

21:37.439 --> 21:41.176
are exactly what's needed right now.

21:48.717 --> 21:50.685
What are you gonna do?

21:53.088 --> 21:55.589
I'm going to build a snowman.

22:09.706 --> 22:13.342
Bollocks. Where the bloody hell is it?

22:13.377 --> 22:15.511
Looking for something?

22:15.545 --> 22:17.613
Not really your concern, is it, lady?

22:17.647 --> 22:18.948
Maybe you should have made a map

22:18.982 --> 22:20.283
for whatever it is you're looking for.

22:20.317 --> 22:22.418
I did make a map, thank you very much.

22:22.452 --> 22:24.586
- Did you lose it?
- No, I didn't lose me map.

22:24.621 --> 22:26.121
It's in me traveling sack, safe and sound.

22:26.155 --> 22:28.624
But you're not "traveling"

22:28.658 --> 22:32.360
because you buried your sack and the map.

22:32.395 --> 22:34.015
Yes. Okay.

22:34.015 --> 22:35.764
I buried the map to find the sack

22:35.799 --> 22:37.566
in the sack I'm trying to find.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.374
- I screwed up. Happens to the best of us.
- Not really.

22:40.577 --> 22:42.103
Well, it happens to the best of us

22:42.138 --> 22:44.872
when we have a touch too much to drink.

22:44.907 --> 22:46.537
- That I buy.
- What's it to you, anyway?

22:46.537 --> 22:48.209
It's not like you're the sheriff.

22:48.244 --> 22:50.645
Oh, no, but... I am the sheriff's wife.

22:50.679 --> 22:52.447
You're married to the blonde?

22:52.481 --> 22:54.149
That's my daughter. Other sheriff.

22:54.183 --> 22:55.950
What now?

22:55.984 --> 22:57.952
You know, in your mug
shot, you looked taller...

22:57.986 --> 22:59.454
And smarter.

22:59.488 --> 23:02.957
Did the sheriff's wife
just call me short and dumb?

23:02.991 --> 23:04.996
I mean, you're not even
gonna try to run, are you?

23:04.996 --> 23:05.810
No.

23:06.161 --> 23:08.796
Consider yourself lucky
that I'm too knackered.

23:08.831 --> 23:12.632
You didn't break out of jail.

23:12.667 --> 23:14.168
I didn't?

23:14.202 --> 23:15.936
My husband let you go.

23:15.971 --> 23:17.838
So I would have a little victory.

23:17.872 --> 23:20.507
Do a little tracking, put
a criminal back behind bars,

23:20.541 --> 23:21.708
feel good about myself.

23:21.742 --> 23:24.311
I bet that you didn't even
do anything very serious.

23:24.346 --> 23:26.080
I got drunk and broke into a library.

23:26.114 --> 23:28.414
Oh! A boozy bookworm!

23:28.449 --> 23:32.251
Oh, this is David. This is so David.

23:32.286 --> 23:34.454
Well... you can admit it.

23:34.489 --> 23:36.590
This whole thing is an elaborate hoax.

23:36.624 --> 23:38.525
What if I did admit it?

23:38.559 --> 23:40.961
I'll pardon you.

23:40.995 --> 23:43.797
Right... so I'm supposed to believe

23:43.831 --> 23:46.432
that the sheriff's wife
can give me my freedom.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.267
- I'm also the mayor.
- He did it.

23:48.302 --> 23:50.136
I knew it!

23:54.241 --> 23:56.209
Looks like Elsa was here.

23:56.243 --> 23:57.543
Thanks, Ms. Swan.

23:57.577 --> 23:59.212
Please continue to point out the obvious.

23:59.246 --> 24:00.546
Then obviously we're not gonna

24:00.580 --> 24:01.881
step on it till we know it's safe.

24:01.915 --> 24:03.716
- It's safe.
- Hey!

24:03.750 --> 24:05.217
You were saying?

24:05.251 --> 24:06.685
I don't know why I even bother.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.521
Well, that makes two of us. Now hurry up.

24:08.555 --> 24:10.122
I'd like to get to that snow queen

24:10.156 --> 24:12.124
before it's actually winter.

24:16.362 --> 24:19.664
Something's not right.

24:19.698 --> 24:21.299
Maybe your sparkly,

24:21.334 --> 24:23.068
blue-dressed friend is
closer than you think.

24:23.102 --> 24:24.736
No. This is not Elsa.

24:24.770 --> 24:26.138
Oh!

24:29.942 --> 24:32.544
It's the snow queen! She found us!

24:34.079 --> 24:36.247
- Sidney.
- Sidney?

24:36.281 --> 24:38.449
What does Sidney have
to do with any of this?

24:40.719 --> 24:43.087
Regina! Talk to me!

24:43.121 --> 24:45.023
What aren't you telling me?

24:57.769 --> 25:00.887
Hey! Hey! Hey!

25:01.208 --> 25:03.274
There's someone in the
house. We need to go.

25:08.245 --> 25:09.345
Lilith?

25:12.383 --> 25:14.317
Run. I got this.

25:14.351 --> 25:16.519
Stay away.

25:16.554 --> 25:19.056
You're not taking us anywhere.

25:19.090 --> 25:21.825
We're not going back into the system.

25:21.859 --> 25:25.495
Sweetheart, what nonsense
you been telling this girl?

25:25.529 --> 25:29.065
What's going on?

25:29.100 --> 25:31.033
Who is this?

25:33.036 --> 25:35.405
Lily?

25:35.439 --> 25:36.906
Honey, tell her the truth.

25:36.940 --> 25:39.209
I'm your father.

25:39.243 --> 25:41.210
And you're coming home with me.

25:41.244 --> 25:42.511
Your mother is worried sick.

25:46.583 --> 25:50.219
Your father?

25:50.253 --> 25:52.922
You have a family?

25:52.956 --> 25:56.458
I thought you were like me.

26:00.096 --> 26:01.597
You lied to me.

26:01.631 --> 26:04.933
You said you didn't have
a clue where Sidney was!

26:04.967 --> 26:06.435
He was in your mirror this whole time?!

26:06.469 --> 26:07.603
Maybe I did. So what?

26:07.637 --> 26:09.204
I don't have to tell
you everything I'm doing.

26:09.239 --> 26:13.141
Nor do I, your majesty.

26:13.175 --> 26:14.475
You led us here.

26:14.510 --> 26:16.745
You're working for the snow queen?!

26:16.779 --> 26:18.479
Traitor!

26:18.514 --> 26:19.981
I'm the traitor?

26:20.016 --> 26:23.151
I think your majesty should
take a look in the mirror.

26:23.185 --> 26:27.488
And as you contemplate what you've done,

26:27.523 --> 26:30.424
know that she has a present for you

26:30.459 --> 26:34.928
that I'd say is well-deserved.

26:36.097 --> 26:37.965
Sidney!

26:39.134 --> 26:40.601
- Regina?
- Save your moral judgment.

26:40.636 --> 26:42.470
Look!

26:49.811 --> 26:50.811
Jump!

27:03.057 --> 27:05.692
I'm not afraid.

27:05.726 --> 27:08.061
I'm not afraid.

27:19.707 --> 27:22.508
You okay?

27:24.544 --> 27:27.180
Regina?

27:27.214 --> 27:30.149
I think we have a bigger problem.

27:37.156 --> 27:41.597
Emma!

27:43.834 --> 27:45.140
Emma.

27:45.887 --> 27:46.680
Emma.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.241
Don't worry about my dad.

27:53.276 --> 27:55.277
He's just pissed I used his visa.

27:57.739 --> 27:59.847
When this blows over, come find me.

27:59.882 --> 28:04.018
We can run away together.

28:04.053 --> 28:06.354
You tricked me.

28:06.389 --> 28:08.089
I'm sorry.

28:08.123 --> 28:11.525
I know I lied about my family,

28:11.560 --> 28:14.195
but everything else I said is true.

28:15.411 --> 28:17.699
I hate my home.

28:17.733 --> 28:22.036
I feel invisible there.

28:22.071 --> 28:23.537
I'm just like you.

28:23.572 --> 28:26.473
I am!

28:26.508 --> 28:29.976
- I was an orphan.
- It's just they adopted me.

28:30.011 --> 28:32.213
But it's not my home.

28:32.247 --> 28:34.215
You promised.

28:34.249 --> 28:38.352
Friends forever, no matter what.

28:55.703 --> 28:57.204
Emma!

28:59.806 --> 29:02.775
Emma!

29:38.811 --> 29:40.178
Oh, that's a problem.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.147
Not helpful.

29:42.181 --> 29:45.350
Try again... together.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.346
I think we did it.

30:15.380 --> 30:16.747
What a welcome visit, ladies.

30:16.782 --> 30:20.951
Thank you for bringing me what I needed.

30:22.887 --> 30:26.323
Give me back my mirror, you...

30:26.357 --> 30:27.891
no.

30:27.926 --> 30:29.492
- Hey, stop!
- Don't...

30:39.136 --> 30:41.170
You want a fight? Fight me.

30:44.875 --> 30:48.678
Well done, Elsa.

30:48.713 --> 30:51.013
You're losing your fear.

30:51.048 --> 30:53.115
There's hope for you yet.

30:53.150 --> 30:56.552
- Let's just finish this now.
- No need.

30:56.586 --> 30:58.754
I have what I want.

31:02.659 --> 31:05.694
Are you both okay?

31:05.729 --> 31:07.196
We are now. Thank you.

31:07.231 --> 31:09.898
Why didn't you tell me about Sidney?

31:09.932 --> 31:12.067
Because, despite what you
wish, we're not partners.

31:12.101 --> 31:14.269
- I didn't ask you to tag along.
- Well, I did.

31:14.303 --> 31:15.303
And if you had told me,

31:15.338 --> 31:16.472
maybe you would have saved us some trouble.

31:16.506 --> 31:18.440
Okay, tell you what?

31:18.475 --> 31:20.942
That I threw Sidney in a
mirror to help me kill Marian,

31:20.977 --> 31:23.078
but then I changed my mind?

31:23.112 --> 31:25.113
What's the point?

31:25.147 --> 31:26.547
You never would have believed me.

31:26.582 --> 31:29.117
I know you too well, Swan.

31:29.151 --> 31:30.451
Stop trying to get me to forgive you

31:30.486 --> 31:31.719
because it will never happen.

31:31.754 --> 31:34.222
Stop it. You two need
to mend your differences.

31:34.257 --> 31:36.624
Otherwise Storybrooke
doesn't stand a chance.

31:36.658 --> 31:38.726
We never will.

31:38.761 --> 31:41.897
For one simple reason...

31:41.931 --> 31:44.565
I don't want to.

31:54.742 --> 31:56.208
You're free.

31:56.243 --> 31:57.710
As promised.

31:57.745 --> 31:59.478
Thank you.

31:59.513 --> 32:04.549
Now, what is it you wish
me to do first, my queen?

32:04.583 --> 32:07.218
I wish nothing from you.

32:07.253 --> 32:09.387
I don't understand.

32:09.421 --> 32:10.388
The deal was...

32:10.422 --> 32:13.659
it wasn't you that I wanted, Sidney.

32:16.428 --> 32:20.665
It was the mirror itself.

32:20.699 --> 32:22.333
You more than anyone

32:22.368 --> 32:24.202
should understand a mirror's importance.

32:24.236 --> 32:29.541
Mirrors reflect our... mood,

32:29.575 --> 32:31.776
our desire,

32:31.810 --> 32:34.111
our essence.

32:34.146 --> 32:37.614
They are a temporary receptacle

32:37.649 --> 32:41.518
for some... Tiny fraction of our soul.

32:41.553 --> 32:44.521
Well, you... you have other mirrors.

32:44.556 --> 32:47.692
I have many... hundreds.

32:47.726 --> 32:50.527
But none as important as this one.

32:50.562 --> 32:53.697
For what I want to do,

32:53.731 --> 32:56.433
your former home should do quite nicely.

32:56.467 --> 32:59.069
The person who trapped you in here

32:59.103 --> 33:01.871
imbued it with much dark magic.

33:01.906 --> 33:05.041
My queen, what are you planning?

33:05.076 --> 33:06.710
What I'm planning

33:06.744 --> 33:12.215
is to get what has been
denied to me for too long...

33:12.249 --> 33:14.550
What I deserve.

33:14.585 --> 33:17.386
And what's that?

33:17.421 --> 33:20.724
That's between me and...

33:20.758 --> 33:24.527
Well, my reflection.

33:32.836 --> 33:36.339
Enjoy your freedom, Sidney.

33:40.110 --> 33:42.277
A word of advice.

33:42.311 --> 33:45.114
Get a warm coat.

33:45.148 --> 33:47.983
It's going to get a bit cooler around here.

34:19.547 --> 34:22.850
So close.

34:22.885 --> 34:24.851
Soon I will have what I want.

34:42.704 --> 34:45.871
A family that loves me.

34:47.875 --> 34:51.844
I'm sorry I took off.
The snow queen tricked me.

34:51.879 --> 34:53.679
She made it seem like Anna was here.

34:53.714 --> 34:55.181
I thought I was chasing her.

34:55.216 --> 34:57.684
I get it. I'd do the same thing.

34:57.718 --> 35:00.687
So why did you let Regina just walk away?

35:00.721 --> 35:02.855
You heard her. She wants
nothing to do with me.

35:02.889 --> 35:05.525
Maybe you shouldn't give up on her so soon.

35:05.559 --> 35:06.693
It's like I said,

35:06.727 --> 35:09.061
once you screw someone
over, there's no going back.

35:09.095 --> 35:10.095
I don't believe that.

35:10.130 --> 35:13.098
If there's one thing my sister taught me,

35:13.133 --> 35:15.067
you don't give up on people.

35:15.101 --> 35:17.269
If someone's important to you,

35:17.304 --> 35:19.738
don't give up on them.

35:19.772 --> 35:22.574
Even if they say hurtful things

35:22.608 --> 35:25.577
or send a giant snow
monster to chase you away.

35:34.454 --> 35:38.423
What do I have to do to get
you to leave me alone, Swan?

35:38.458 --> 35:40.525
Go away.

35:40.560 --> 35:41.960
I'm an idiot.

35:41.994 --> 35:43.795
Finally, something we can agree on.

35:43.830 --> 35:45.964
I'm an idiot because I've
been down this road before.

35:45.998 --> 35:49.234
- Irritating me? Yes, you have.
- No, when I was a kid.

35:49.268 --> 35:51.202
Someone came into my life for a while,

35:51.237 --> 35:54.572
and I thought we were
gonna be... Best friends.

35:54.606 --> 35:56.707
But this girl lied to me,

35:56.742 --> 35:58.276
and I pushed her away because of that lie,

35:58.310 --> 36:00.078
and she asked me to forgive
her, but I never did.

36:00.112 --> 36:02.747
It took some time, but I
realized that was a mistake.

36:02.781 --> 36:05.416
And I regretted the decision.
But by then, it was too late.

36:05.450 --> 36:07.418
The damage was already done.

36:07.452 --> 36:09.987
I don't want to make the
same mistake again, Regina.

36:10.021 --> 36:14.658
Living in Storybrooke, I've
got my son and my parents,

36:14.693 --> 36:16.159
and I love them.

36:16.194 --> 36:18.662
But they can't always understand me.

36:18.697 --> 36:20.133
They don't know what it feels like

36:20.133 --> 36:21.499
to be rejected and misunderstood...

36:21.533 --> 36:23.667
not the way I do, not the way you do.

36:23.702 --> 36:27.670
And somehow that makes us...
I don't know... unique,

36:27.705 --> 36:29.739
or maybe even special.

36:32.610 --> 36:36.579
I wasn't looking for
you to assuage my guilt.

36:36.614 --> 36:40.284
I was just looking for you to be my friend.

36:40.318 --> 36:43.286
You thought we were friends?

36:43.320 --> 36:46.289
Crazy, right?

36:46.323 --> 36:51.327
But I thought it could
be, that it was possible.

36:51.361 --> 36:55.331
I'm not gonna stop trying.

36:55.365 --> 36:57.333
Even if you still want to kill me.

37:00.137 --> 37:02.638
Emma, wait.

37:04.574 --> 37:08.544
I don't want to kill you.

37:08.578 --> 37:10.879
See?

37:10.914 --> 37:13.649
That's a start.

37:13.683 --> 37:15.684
Hey.

37:24.494 --> 37:26.227
Mm.

37:26.262 --> 37:28.964
I love you.

37:28.998 --> 37:30.498
Oh, I love you, too.

37:30.532 --> 37:33.134
How's Neal?

37:33.169 --> 37:34.735
He survive an hour with Belle?

37:34.770 --> 37:36.637
She was wonderful.

37:36.672 --> 37:38.340
Took great care of him.

37:38.374 --> 37:40.175
I caught the thief.

37:40.209 --> 37:41.409
What?

37:41.444 --> 37:44.846
Will Scarlet. I tracked him down.

37:44.880 --> 37:47.181
That's amazing.

37:47.215 --> 37:49.684
W-well, where is he? Back in his cell?

37:49.718 --> 37:51.318
Eh, I pardoned him.

37:51.353 --> 37:53.855
Wait. What? It's okay.

37:53.889 --> 37:55.255
He admitted the whole thing.

37:55.290 --> 37:57.057
He told me about how
you let him escape

37:57.092 --> 37:58.726
so I could track him.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.361
- H-h-he told you that?
- Don't be mad.

38:00.395 --> 38:02.096
He tried to keep your secret.

38:02.130 --> 38:03.998
But really, he's a terrible liar.

38:04.032 --> 38:07.834
Not to mention, I am
familiar with your tricks.

38:07.869 --> 38:10.670
Your plan worked.

38:10.705 --> 38:13.207
I feel more like myself again.

38:16.144 --> 38:18.445
- What's so funny?
- Yeah, no, Mary Margaret.

38:18.480 --> 38:20.780
I couldn't be happier that
you enjoyed yourself today,

38:20.815 --> 38:23.550
but I had nothing to do with it.

38:23.584 --> 38:26.219
No, of course you
did. I mean, the way...

38:26.253 --> 38:28.087
mnh-mnh.

38:28.122 --> 38:31.024
- He really did escape?
- Yeah.

38:31.058 --> 38:34.093
And you really pardoned him.

38:34.128 --> 38:38.731
Well, what do we do now?

38:38.765 --> 38:41.901
Uh, hope he doesn't pass
out in another library?

38:41.935 --> 38:46.739
Look, if the outcome of his escape

38:46.773 --> 38:53.412
is that you found a
part of yourself again...

38:53.446 --> 38:56.549
I'd say he earned that pardon.

39:25.711 --> 39:27.311
Hello, love.

39:32.350 --> 39:33.985
You seem vexed...

39:34.019 --> 39:37.689
Like you could use a drink.

39:39.558 --> 39:42.293
That's putting it lightly.

39:42.327 --> 39:44.361
What's that?

39:44.396 --> 39:48.132
What's left of my childhood.

39:50.668 --> 39:53.237
May I have the honor?

40:08.987 --> 40:10.954
Are you okay?

40:10.989 --> 40:13.156
I think so.

40:57.667 --> 41:01.836
Swan?

41:04.207 --> 41:06.340
I haven't watched this since I recorded it,

41:06.375 --> 41:09.711
but some things happened today,
made me think about the past.

41:09.745 --> 41:13.014
Reflective today, are we?

41:13.049 --> 41:15.917
Hey. Show me.

41:15.951 --> 41:18.753
I'd love to know more
about your beginnings.

41:31.900 --> 41:35.035
Who's that lass?

41:35.070 --> 41:38.739
Just an old friend.

41:47.816 --> 41:50.617
Hey, look what the new
girl brought with her!

41:50.651 --> 41:52.119
Where is that?

41:52.153 --> 41:55.788
I... I don't really remember.

41:55.823 --> 41:57.624
Maybe my next foster home?

41:57.658 --> 42:00.726
- Blocked it out? Unpleasant time?
- I guess.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.595
Who's that? Another friend?

42:02.629 --> 42:05.897
I don't remember any of this.

42:05.932 --> 42:07.899
Give it back, Kevin.

42:07.934 --> 42:11.403
The camera is Emma's,
not yours. Bloody hell.

42:11.438 --> 42:12.971
Is that...?

42:13.005 --> 42:15.841
We respect property in this house, Emma.

42:18.044 --> 42:20.078
Yeah.
