WEBVTT

00:02.705 --> 00:04.747
[Milo] Wow! I love nature

00:04.831 --> 00:06.123
when it's not on fire.

00:06.206 --> 00:08.747
The trees, the skies,
chirping birds.

00:08.831 --> 00:09.831
The fresh smell of leaves.

00:09.956 --> 00:12.622
The cruel indifference
of larger animals

00:12.705 --> 00:14.164
devouring smaller animals.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.997
Pine cones, the flowers,

00:16.081 --> 00:18.455
and the annoying nibble
of small woodland creatures

00:18.539 --> 00:20.789
that have no idea what
personal space is.

00:20.872 --> 00:22.831
Ah! Isn't this
the perfect spot?

00:22.914 --> 00:26.289
Yeah, and not too far from
my folks if we need anything.

00:26.373 --> 00:27.664
You sure they don't
want to join us?

00:27.747 --> 00:31.039
They have a slightly different
definition of roughing it.

00:31.789 --> 00:33.373
I love camping.

00:34.872 --> 00:36.331
Looking good, Milo.

00:36.414 --> 00:37.956
Hey, Melissa, you need any
help setting up your tent?

00:38.039 --> 00:41.539
No, I'm done. But maybe later you can
help me dig a moat.

00:41.622 --> 00:43.289
I've been camping
with Milo before,

00:43.373 --> 00:45.289
but never this far
from a major hospital.

00:45.373 --> 00:47.622
C'mon Zack, we've already
been here five minutes

00:47.705 --> 00:48.747
and nothing's gone wrong.

00:51.705 --> 00:55.831
Okay, technically
a squirrel stampede isn't wrong.

00:55.914 --> 00:57.039
We are in the wild.

00:57.123 --> 00:59.123
Yeah, the wolverines
in my kitchen was wrong.

00:59.206 --> 01:00.580
Exactly.

01:05.248 --> 01:07.664
Wow, look at that.
Campfire's ready.

01:07.747 --> 01:10.580
[Dakota] I still can't believe
Mr. Block thinks we fabricated

01:10.664 --> 01:12.997
the whole pistachios
taking over the future thing.

01:13.081 --> 01:14.539
Who would make up
something like that?

01:14.622 --> 01:17.039
Someone who wants to
get off pistachio duty?

01:17.123 --> 01:18.831
Yeah, okay.
I see his point.

01:18.914 --> 01:20.164
[beeps]

01:20.248 --> 01:21.872
Well, well, well,
look who it is.

01:21.956 --> 01:22.997
The future savers.

01:23.081 --> 01:25.206
Oh, and look who just
came into my office.

01:25.289 --> 01:26.997
Your two biggest fans,

01:27.081 --> 01:29.664
Bigfoot and the
Loch Ness Monster.

01:29.747 --> 01:30.997
Yes, very clever sir.

01:31.081 --> 01:33.164
Now, listen up. It's come
to our attention that

01:33.248 --> 01:35.206
a critical strain
of wild pistachios

01:35.289 --> 01:39.206
is going to be destroyed by a rare flock
of red-beaked crows. Tonight!

01:39.289 --> 01:40.622
-Oh, great!
-Great?

01:40.705 --> 01:43.039
Um, no, I mean, bad.

01:43.123 --> 01:44.373
Bad crows.

01:44.455 --> 01:46.455
You two imbeciles
need to stop these birds

01:46.539 --> 01:49.123
and save the pistachios
at all costs.

01:49.206 --> 01:53.789
I don't want to hear any more nonsense
about sentient nut trees.

01:53.872 --> 01:55.914
-Is that clear?
-[both] Yes, sir.

01:55.997 --> 01:57.331
And don't forget
your receipt.

02:00.789 --> 02:02.123
And after we saved him

02:02.206 --> 02:04.747
and the entire future,
this is the thanks we get.

02:04.831 --> 02:07.539
No, it's not his fault. Once the pistachio
plant was destroyed

02:07.622 --> 02:08.580
everything must have
returned to normal.

02:08.664 --> 02:10.206
The time stream
healed around him.

02:10.289 --> 02:12.747
He'll never know
what we did.

02:12.831 --> 02:14.414
So what do we do now?

02:14.497 --> 02:16.289
I don't know. If we succeed
in saving pistachios,

02:16.373 --> 02:18.747
we could very well
doom the world. Again.

02:18.831 --> 02:22.580
Which means we can't interfere
with those birds as ordered.

02:22.664 --> 02:25.414
It would be better if
we did absolutely nothing.

02:25.497 --> 02:28.914
Hey, hey, I got an idea.
Sounds like a ditch day to me.

02:28.997 --> 02:29.831
Hey, what do you say?

02:29.914 --> 02:32.164
Well, I can't actually
believe am saying this but...

Hey, look at this big guy
coming to party with us.

Here you go, buddy.

03:55.664 --> 03:58.580
Oh, dear. This is just like
the old horror movie.

03:58.664 --> 03:59.580
Neptune Needs Women?

03:59.664 --> 04:02.414
Yes. No, not
Neptune Needs Women.

04:02.497 --> 04:04.831
What about this reminds you
of Neptune Needs Women?

04:04.914 --> 04:06.081
Yeah, you know, they
had that scene

04:06.164 --> 04:08.164
with the limburger sandwich
and the Neptunian queen

04:08.248 --> 04:14.248
is all like, "Men." It was hilarious.
Just the way she said it, "Men."

04:14.331 --> 04:16.206
Hmm, those red beaks.

04:16.289 --> 04:18.497
Oh, I thought so.

04:18.580 --> 04:20.331
Those are red beak crows.

04:20.414 --> 04:23.622
What if these were the birds that were
going to destroy that pistachio field?

04:23.705 --> 04:24.914
Uh-oh.

04:24.997 --> 04:26.956
And we've led them off course.

04:27.039 --> 04:28.455
Uh-oh, again.

04:28.539 --> 04:32.539
That would mean those
pistachio plants are still alive.

04:33.956 --> 04:38.039
C'mon birdies, we've got some
nice pistachios for you.

04:38.872 --> 04:40.081
Why aren't they following us?

04:40.164 --> 04:42.580
Maybe they like limburger
more than pistachios.

04:42.664 --> 04:44.539
Here, c'mon birdies,
follow the limburger.

04:44.622 --> 04:47.872
Here we go. Wait... Wait... Wait...
Not like that...

04:50.081 --> 04:52.123

04:52.206 --> 04:53.705

And you sleep dressed
as a mealworm?

Never mind that. Milo is sleepwalking.
Oh, we'll just wake him up.

05:38.997 --> 05:41.580
-Hey, Milo!
-No!

05:41.664 --> 05:43.497
You're not supposed to
wake a sleepwalker.

05:43.580 --> 05:44.539

an old wives' tale.
