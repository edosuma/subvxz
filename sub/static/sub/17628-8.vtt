Previously on "Salem"...

00:03.266 --> 00:04.895
You're free of my son,

00:04.920 --> 00:06.614
but his brother is still here.

00:06.654 --> 00:07.739
Come Black Sunday,

00:07.764 --> 00:10.364
my true brothers will rise from hell

00:10.389 --> 00:11.809
and stand beside me.

00:11.834 --> 00:13.028
This is his weapon.

00:13.053 --> 00:15.161
Red Mercury. I
want nothing of it.

00:15.186 --> 00:16.778
I have others to think of.

00:16.803 --> 00:18.028
My baby.

00:18.053 --> 00:19.231
Cotton's baby.

00:19.256 --> 00:20.684
You're asking me to marry you.

00:20.709 --> 00:22.450
This business of love.

00:22.475 --> 00:24.239
All this must be one.

00:24.264 --> 00:26.278
But there remains one obstacle.

00:26.303 --> 00:27.883
Isaac.

00:27.908 --> 00:29.217
No tears.

00:29.272 --> 00:31.825
You are the luckiest girl I know.

00:31.850 --> 00:33.708
Everything you
need to kill an angel.

00:33.733 --> 00:36.864
You must forge a dagger with that in it

00:36.889 --> 00:38.919
and kill him with the dagger.

00:38.944 --> 00:41.403
You can do
whatever you want to me.

00:41.428 --> 00:43.434
- Just not here.
- Yes.

00:43.459 --> 00:46.020
Alden will most likely think
it all a dream in the morning,

00:46.045 --> 00:47.637
but he'll never forget what he has seen.

00:47.662 --> 00:49.155
What lies beyond that door?

00:49.180 --> 00:52.377
Beyond that
door lies hell itself.

Oh, co... come in, my lord.

03:48.606 --> 03:51.388
You're... You're most welcome.
You're most welcome.

04:00.318 --> 04:02.428
- The instrument...
- Oh, my God.

04:02.461 --> 04:04.956
will be placed
here, in your trust.

04:04.990 --> 04:07.996
But be very careful.

04:08.030 --> 04:13.179
The instrument is filled
with Red Mercury.

04:13.214 --> 04:16.154
When the hammer strikes, all will blow.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.195
Your work has not gone unnoticed.

04:19.228 --> 04:22.299
Thank you. Thank you.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.187
You are a flesh artist.

04:24.221 --> 04:25.788
Thank you.

04:25.821 --> 04:27.675
And in the new
Commonwealth of Hell

04:27.710 --> 04:28.859
that we shall build on this earth,

04:28.893 --> 04:31.067
you may carve mountains
of flesh if you like...

04:31.102 --> 04:33.339
Just tell me what am I to do.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.132
Guard the instrument.

04:35.165 --> 04:37.179
Let no man disturb it.

04:37.214 --> 04:39.579
And if you would survive,
come to the Sibley Mansion

04:39.613 --> 04:42.587
before the clock strikes on Sunday.

04:42.622 --> 04:45.147
Can I offer you food or a drink?

04:45.181 --> 04:47.707
I have no taste for food.

04:47.740 --> 04:50.107
But drink, I like.

04:50.141 --> 04:52.155
It briefly restores lost wings.

04:52.189 --> 04:54.587
Try this.

05:02.461 --> 05:05.275
Gin.

05:05.309 --> 05:07.100
It burns.

05:07.133 --> 05:10.011
I like it.

05:30.588 --> 05:32.154
What is it?

05:32.188 --> 05:34.298
I did it. He's dead.

05:34.332 --> 05:36.697
Who?

05:38.588 --> 05:40.410
You mean...

05:40.443 --> 05:42.297
Yes. Torn apart.

05:42.332 --> 05:45.499
Left for the animals
to eat, if they dare.

05:45.532 --> 05:48.921
Now, will you help me?

05:48.956 --> 05:50.745
If you have killed the boy

05:50.779 --> 05:53.401
and sent the devil back to hell,
then what more do you need?

05:53.435 --> 05:55.032
Bastard Samael!

05:58.139 --> 05:59.480
You old bastard!

05:59.515 --> 06:01.273
Who is that bellowing?

06:03.067 --> 06:06.521
I believe it is our host.

06:06.554 --> 06:08.921
You are most industrious, my lady.

06:08.955 --> 06:10.201
No rest for the wicked.

06:10.234 --> 06:12.665
What conspiracies do you spin now?

06:12.699 --> 06:16.313
You know very well.
The job is but half done.

06:16.347 --> 06:18.105
We still need to take him out.

06:18.139 --> 06:20.633
Samael!

06:20.667 --> 06:22.105
You... You wanted to be king, brother.

06:22.139 --> 06:25.817
Do you like your little kingdom?

06:32.666 --> 06:34.425
Ohh.

06:34.458 --> 06:36.345
His royal court.

06:36.378 --> 06:39.576
Come to bow and scrape?

06:39.610 --> 06:41.785
It makes no difference to me.

06:41.818 --> 06:45.721
I want no worship and no worshippers.

06:45.754 --> 06:47.640
Then what do you want?

06:47.674 --> 06:49.240
Now that all that was his is yours.

06:49.274 --> 06:51.705
To complete the task.

06:51.738 --> 06:54.552
As intended. Without any distraction...

06:54.587 --> 06:56.119
from you.

06:56.154 --> 06:57.304
N-No.

06:57.337 --> 07:00.471
You're no threat to me or mine now.

07:00.505 --> 07:02.519
None of you are.

07:02.553 --> 07:07.704
I... I don't share my late
brother's ambition to be God,

07:07.737 --> 07:09.944
nor... nor to marry my mother,

07:09.977 --> 07:12.472
nor even to destroy all of mankind,

07:12.506 --> 07:15.223
although I don't
particularly mind if I do.

07:15.258 --> 07:18.871
All I want is to free my fallen angels

07:18.905 --> 07:20.791
and make Earth their new home.

07:20.825 --> 07:25.591
Black Sunday is still coming.

07:25.625 --> 07:30.743
Death and destruction to Salem.

07:30.776 --> 07:35.222
Do not imagine you have
killed my brother.

07:35.256 --> 07:41.238
You have only destroyed
his mortal self...

07:41.273 --> 07:46.007
merely sent him back to hell.

07:46.040 --> 07:49.782
Now, more than ever,

07:49.817 --> 07:55.830
it is imperative that none
of you open the wrong doors.

07:58.136 --> 08:00.310
Do not let that boy back in.

08:19.256 --> 08:21.142
Dorcas?

08:26.936 --> 08:28.342
Easy, boy.

08:28.375 --> 08:31.253
Easy. It's only me.

08:31.288 --> 08:33.621
Easy.

08:33.655 --> 08:35.541
Dorcas?

08:53.813 --> 08:55.188
Anne?

08:56.789 --> 08:58.387
Anne?!

09:00.469 --> 09:02.162
- Cheese!
- Cheese.

09:02.196 --> 09:03.640
Mm! Mm!

09:03.665 --> 09:05.326
I have been craving cheese.

09:05.351 --> 09:07.003
And... oh, cornbread.

09:07.028 --> 09:09.631
- And beans.
- Beans.

09:09.656 --> 09:10.742
Oh, beans.

09:10.776 --> 09:12.502
I shall have the beans on the cornbread,

09:12.536 --> 09:14.422
- with the cheese.
- My love...

09:14.456 --> 09:16.054
Pregnancy is hungry work.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.268
My love, the boy is dead,

09:17.307 --> 09:19.288
or at least banished back to hell.

09:19.323 --> 09:20.313
How?

09:20.347 --> 09:23.066
A mass sacrifice of witches.

09:23.099 --> 09:26.041
It was orchestrated by Mary Sibley...

09:26.075 --> 09:27.225
the Essex Hive.

09:27.259 --> 09:29.560
Their tree tore him limb from limb.

09:29.595 --> 09:31.961
So, we are safe.

09:31.987 --> 09:34.680
No. Not quite. The
Sentinel still lives.

09:34.714 --> 09:36.343
But I do begin to hope
that we may be able

09:36.378 --> 09:37.784
to stop all this from happening.

09:37.818 --> 09:38.744
"We"?

09:38.778 --> 09:40.664
Yes. Mary Sibley,
Sebastian Marburg,

09:40.698 --> 09:43.320
John Alden, and I.

09:43.354 --> 09:45.079
Cotton, they are not your friends.

09:45.114 --> 09:46.552
You cannot trust them.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.112
No, but my enemy's enemy

09:49.146 --> 09:51.639
will have to do in such dark times.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.304
Now, please move into the mansion now...

09:53.338 --> 09:54.360
no more waiting.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.705
I am ready to quit
this house and move today,

09:55.738 --> 09:58.232
but why must you take so much risk?

09:58.265 --> 10:00.152
You have me and the baby to think of.

10:00.185 --> 10:02.392
And that is why I
must risk so much, my love.

10:02.426 --> 10:04.345
So that our little hope may
yet grow up in God's country

10:04.378 --> 10:05.657
and not the devil's.

10:05.690 --> 10:08.823
Please move into the mansion.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.327
In case I fail.

10:21.017 --> 10:22.423
Something's happened to her.

10:22.458 --> 10:23.927
I know it.

10:26.938 --> 10:28.248
They're ready for you.

10:28.281 --> 10:30.647
You need to keep looking
for her while I'm in there.

10:30.681 --> 10:32.439
I will.

10:32.473 --> 10:34.423
I'll be out as soon as I can.

10:34.457 --> 10:36.279
Put those two outside.

10:36.313 --> 10:38.391
And keep everyone away.

10:58.585 --> 11:00.503
Mary.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.086
You live?

11:07.736 --> 11:09.975
Now I believe anything's possible.

11:13.336 --> 11:14.934
Let's hope so, old friend.

11:24.375 --> 11:28.694
Now, gentlemen, we have less
than 48 hours to save Salem.

11:28.728 --> 11:30.358
With respect, Mary.

11:30.392 --> 11:33.270
It's the people that matter...
not the town.

11:33.303 --> 11:35.510
So why not lead them out of here?

11:35.543 --> 11:38.101
The woods are full of enemies.

11:38.136 --> 11:39.701
So, unless you have a fleet of ships

11:39.735 --> 11:41.910
that can sail every man,
woman, and child out of here,

11:41.943 --> 11:43.381
I think it's best that
we save this town.

11:43.415 --> 11:47.669
Please forgive me.

11:47.702 --> 11:49.493
While you work to save all our lives,

11:49.526 --> 11:52.500
I must see to one small but...
precious life.

11:55.255 --> 11:57.973
My men guard the door.
No one will disturb you.

12:02.102 --> 12:04.693
If anyone can save the
people of this town,

12:04.726 --> 12:06.676
it's you two together.

12:20.726 --> 12:24.339
Every one of us is needed now...

12:24.374 --> 12:26.804
as every one of us have played
our role in this resistance.

12:26.838 --> 12:28.628
What role was it
that Captain Alden played?

12:28.662 --> 12:30.035
Remind me.

12:30.070 --> 12:32.276
Apart, that is, from siring
the brat in the first place

12:32.310 --> 12:33.236
and then running away?

12:33.270 --> 12:35.348
I can take out the Sentinel.

12:35.382 --> 12:36.628
How?

12:36.661 --> 12:38.548
Tituba gave me instructions.

12:38.581 --> 12:41.140
Tituba?

12:41.174 --> 12:42.228
When?

12:42.262 --> 12:43.508
Does it matter?

12:43.541 --> 12:46.548
I'm not sure. Maybe.

12:46.582 --> 12:49.428
Go on.

12:49.462 --> 12:51.058
Following her instructions...

12:53.044 --> 12:57.299
I've forged a dagger that
can kill a fallen angel.

12:57.333 --> 12:59.027
Good work, blacksmith.

12:59.061 --> 13:00.658
Why not hand it over to a swordsman.

13:00.693 --> 13:05.107
What I need is help
making sure he is someplace

13:05.141 --> 13:08.531
I can drag him into a dark
alley and get the job done.

13:08.565 --> 13:10.291
I-I think I can do that.

13:10.324 --> 13:13.298
I have a certain dialogue
with the creature.

13:13.333 --> 13:14.739
I believe I can draw him out.

13:14.773 --> 13:16.499
Good.

13:16.533 --> 13:17.938
I will seek out Tituba

13:17.973 --> 13:20.083
and inform her of the boy's destruction.

13:20.116 --> 13:23.122
But even if Captain Alden succeeds,

13:23.156 --> 13:25.939
there still remains a great task.

13:25.972 --> 13:29.427
Yes. Ridding Salem
of every last witch.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.858
This from the world's
least effective witch hunter.

13:31.892 --> 13:34.099
Who couldn't even find one
in the bed beside him.

13:34.133 --> 13:35.474
The Sentinel has made it clear

13:35.509 --> 13:37.075
that he has armed his instrument.

13:37.109 --> 13:40.466
The Red Mercury is somewhere in Salem,

13:40.500 --> 13:42.067
all ready to do its
work of destruction...

13:42.100 --> 13:43.506
with or without him.

13:43.540 --> 13:45.619
I know where it is.

13:47.220 --> 13:52.306
But I shall not be sharing
that information just yet.

13:52.341 --> 13:55.026
I'm aware of how most
of you feel about me,

13:55.060 --> 13:56.497
and I would have some
insurance that I am not fated

13:56.532 --> 13:58.770
to go the same way as the
boy and his Sentinel.

13:58.804 --> 14:00.306
No.

14:00.339 --> 14:03.026
I intend to make myself a
necessary part of your plans.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.010
You selfish, sick,
murdering bastard.

14:05.043 --> 14:06.450
Ohh!

14:08.340 --> 14:09.586
Whatever is between you...

14:09.620 --> 14:11.250
now is not the time.

14:11.284 --> 14:15.697
We have a common goal
to stop Black Sunday.

14:15.732 --> 14:17.171
To save our future.

14:21.492 --> 14:23.090
You're right.

14:24.468 --> 14:27.473
We mustn't let petty jealousies
get in the way of our goal.

14:27.507 --> 14:30.577
Now I suggest we part.

14:30.611 --> 14:35.185
To avoid arousing suspicion,
we should leave singly...

14:35.219 --> 14:37.105
in case we're discovered.

14:47.763 --> 14:49.585
Shall we?

14:49.619 --> 14:51.985
Singly. Remember?

14:52.018 --> 14:53.298
So as not to arouse suspicion.

15:16.211 --> 15:17.616
<i>You should close his mouth,</i>

15:17.650 --> 15:19.952
<i>or the flies will get in.</i>

15:29.010 --> 15:31.824
<i>My brother cannot hold his liquor.</i>

15:31.858 --> 15:35.056
<i>In our pure state, angels...
fallen or otherwise...</i>

15:35.090 --> 15:36.784
<i>never sleep.</i>

15:36.818 --> 15:40.464
<i>Even in my child's body, I
did not so lower myself,</i>

15:40.498 --> 15:43.664
<i>but my brother is made of grosser
stuff.</i>

15:43.698 --> 15:45.264
<i>Do not trust him.</i>

15:45.298 --> 15:46.544
<i>And do not trust Mary Sibley.</i>

15:52.561 --> 15:55.024
<i>Not if you value your life,</i>

15:55.058 --> 15:56.464
<i>Cotton Mather's life,</i>

15:56.497 --> 15:58.608
<i>and the life of your child to come.</i>

15:58.642 --> 16:00.464
What do you mean?

16:00.498 --> 16:02.544
<i>Only I can guarantee the safety</i>

16:02.578 --> 16:04.304
<i>of your would-be family.</i>

16:04.338 --> 16:07.054
<i>You, Mather, the child...</i>

16:07.089 --> 16:11.056
<i>will live long lives of royalty
and privilege in my kingdom.</i>

16:15.217 --> 16:18.703
<i>All you must do is let me in.</i>

16:31.569 --> 16:34.287
<i>Turn the handle.</i>

16:46.864 --> 16:48.269
<i>But it is locked.</i>

16:48.304 --> 16:50.349
<i>Not for you it isn't.</i>

16:50.384 --> 16:51.502
<i>You're a witch.</i>

16:51.536 --> 16:55.182
<i>I gave you power. Use it!</i>

16:55.216 --> 16:57.135
Anne!

16:58.735 --> 17:01.902
Stay away from that door at all costs.

17:01.936 --> 17:03.182
Do not open it.

17:03.216 --> 17:05.326
What makes you
think I was going to?

17:05.358 --> 17:07.566
I have watched you
standing there entranced

17:07.599 --> 17:09.453
these last few moments.

17:12.686 --> 17:15.469
- What is behind it?
- Hell.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.941
The three of us may yet have
a chance at a happy life.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.148
We may be able to stop all this madness.

17:27.887 --> 17:29.708
Anne.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.787
I am no toy. Do not play with me.

17:47.822 --> 17:51.980
I know why you did what you did...

17:52.014 --> 17:54.507
and I forgive you.

17:54.542 --> 17:56.587
 You forgive me?!

17:56.622 --> 17:59.340
You should be begging
for my forgiveness.

17:59.373 --> 18:01.644
Tell me you don't enjoy his touch.

18:01.678 --> 18:05.293
I cannot command my body.

18:05.326 --> 18:07.051
But my heart felt nothing.

18:07.086 --> 18:10.860
It curdled inside me every time he...
he touched me.

18:10.893 --> 18:13.036
And I had to endure it.

18:13.070 --> 18:14.156
And beg for more.

18:14.189 --> 18:17.035
Why? For us, John.

18:17.068 --> 18:19.275
Are you really as dense
as he says you are?

18:19.310 --> 18:21.580
The only reason I'm going to Tituba

18:21.613 --> 18:23.595
is to learn about the weapon.
She's a seer.

18:23.629 --> 18:27.819
If she knows a way to stop this...
this bomb,

18:27.854 --> 18:29.547
then we won't need Sebastian,

18:29.581 --> 18:31.788
and I can cease this
charade once and for all.

18:31.822 --> 18:35.820
Even after he protected
you in that house?

18:35.853 --> 18:39.019
You don't feel any fondness
or affection for him?

18:41.646 --> 18:43.564
Not a drop.

18:50.285 --> 18:51.786
Forgive my density.

18:51.820 --> 18:54.059
That's all I needed to hear.

19:01.901 --> 19:05.098
We are such fools in love, aren't we?

19:05.131 --> 19:07.562
And I am the
greatest fool of them all.

19:09.931 --> 19:12.970
I must go.

19:53.168 --> 19:56.174
Your clever Mercy
lured the waif out

19:56.208 --> 19:58.292
with the voice of her
dear departed mother.

19:58.317 --> 20:02.763
Nothing incites
a mob to violence faster

20:02.797 --> 20:04.683
than a threat against a child.

20:06.029 --> 20:08.970
Shh! Quiet.

20:09.005 --> 20:12.810
We are trying to restore
your reputation,

20:12.845 --> 20:15.082
not blacken it.

20:19.405 --> 20:20.970
I didn't just do it for me.

20:21.004 --> 20:24.651
Isaac's growing stature and
real power in Knockers Hole

20:24.684 --> 20:27.435
represents the greatest
threat to your hold on Salem.

20:27.468 --> 20:29.482
Something had to be done.

20:29.517 --> 20:32.043
You should be thanking me.

20:32.076 --> 20:34.026
Don't walk away from me.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.154
I've such grand plans for us.

21:20.236 --> 21:22.730
Tituba. I do not have
magic to open this door.

21:22.764 --> 21:24.426
You must let me in.

21:34.123 --> 21:37.033
The boy is dead.

21:37.067 --> 21:39.753
But at the cost of all our sisters.

21:39.787 --> 21:44.042
The power of sacrifice.
Well played.

21:46.475 --> 21:48.041
Yes.

21:48.076 --> 21:51.914
It is but a partial victory.

21:56.782 --> 21:59.660
You are tired.

21:59.694 --> 22:01.932
Sit down.

22:01.966 --> 22:04.716
I will do that for you.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.635
Sit!

22:15.277 --> 22:17.675
I thought you were
no longer my servant.

22:17.710 --> 22:20.940
But I am your host.

22:23.150 --> 22:24.395
Here.

22:25.229 --> 22:27.148
Thank you.

22:35.757 --> 22:38.923
You told John to kill the Sentinel.
Armed him for it.

22:38.956 --> 22:40.682
I did.

22:40.716 --> 22:44.522
Why not aim him at the boy?

22:44.556 --> 22:46.337
I mean, they're both fallen angels.

22:46.470 --> 22:49.315
What would kill one would
surely kill the other.

22:49.350 --> 22:51.396
I am the seer.

22:51.430 --> 22:53.220
I foresaw that you would handle that.

22:53.254 --> 22:56.996
Your blind eyes...

22:57.030 --> 22:59.236
They see so much.

22:59.269 --> 23:02.435
Have you seen where they've
hidden the weapon?

23:02.470 --> 23:05.635
My eyes cannot
be everywhere at once,

23:05.669 --> 23:08.643
but my cat will search
the town for the weapon.

23:29.733 --> 23:30.915
No.

23:30.948 --> 23:34.435
Try Bishop...

23:34.469 --> 23:36.194
to C4.

23:36.228 --> 23:37.857
Check.

23:45.220 --> 23:47.074
Check!

23:47.108 --> 23:50.229
I wish I could see his face at that!

23:50.254 --> 23:53.132
When's the last time you did?

23:53.166 --> 23:54.283
What?

23:54.317 --> 23:56.652
See God's face.

24:01.261 --> 24:04.300
When I was falling,

24:04.334 --> 24:08.011
I caught a glimpse of that great cloud

24:08.045 --> 24:10.826
raining down disappointment...

24:10.860 --> 24:12.331
upon me.

24:12.365 --> 24:15.051
But it was ever so.

24:15.084 --> 24:18.538
I think I know what you mean.

24:18.572 --> 24:21.771
I myself had a very disapproving father.

24:21.804 --> 24:23.979
I've often wondered

24:24.012 --> 24:26.698
what it would have felt like
to look him in the face

24:26.733 --> 24:28.938
as I killed Him.

24:28.972 --> 24:32.619
It would've felt awful.

24:32.652 --> 24:34.315
Trust me. I should know.

24:36.973 --> 24:38.442
You killed your father?

24:38.476 --> 24:40.650
Yes.

24:40.684 --> 24:42.890
It felt like swallowing a stone.

24:42.923 --> 24:46.922
One that would weigh inside me forever.

24:49.291 --> 24:50.762
But it didn't.

24:50.795 --> 24:52.490
You forgave yourself?

24:52.523 --> 24:53.577
No.

24:53.612 --> 24:57.065
He forgave me.

24:57.100 --> 25:01.257
My father is
incapable of forgiveness...

25:01.292 --> 25:03.977
at least when it comes to my kind.

25:04.012 --> 25:05.449
With you I think it's possible

25:05.483 --> 25:08.970
to know everything, and
yet understand nothing.

25:09.004 --> 25:10.505
You're very
bold today, Mather.

25:10.540 --> 25:12.617
Facing the end of
the world as I know it

25:12.652 --> 25:14.505
seems to have that effect on me.

25:14.538 --> 25:16.585
I never would
have guessed that.

25:16.618 --> 25:20.905
What else might there be
that you don't know about us?

25:20.939 --> 25:24.296
Given that you're bringing about
our imminent destruction,

25:24.331 --> 25:26.985
perhaps it would be wise
to get a taste of the life

25:27.018 --> 25:29.929
that God bestowed on his...

25:29.962 --> 25:31.753
favorite creation.

25:33.291 --> 25:35.369
Perhaps you're right.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.257
I should know more about humanity,

25:37.291 --> 25:40.937
but truth be told, my head aches.

25:40.971 --> 25:43.209
That's called a hangover.

25:43.242 --> 25:45.097
Mm.

25:45.131 --> 25:46.889
What you need is a hair
of the hound that bit you.

25:46.923 --> 25:49.129
No hound bit me,
and I don't eat hounds

25:49.162 --> 25:50.216
or their hair.

25:50.251 --> 25:51.784
I know... it's an expression.

25:51.819 --> 25:54.217
A metaphor.

25:54.250 --> 25:56.424
See, another thing you
don't understand about us

25:56.458 --> 26:00.104
is that we oftentimes say
one thing to mean another.

26:00.138 --> 26:02.857
We use nonsense to...

26:02.890 --> 26:04.808
to make sense.

26:04.842 --> 26:06.024
You're right.
I don't understand.

26:06.058 --> 26:08.104
And you're making my headache worse.

26:08.139 --> 26:10.024
What I mean to say
is, I know what you need.

26:10.059 --> 26:11.624
Which is?

26:11.658 --> 26:14.089
More gin.

26:14.122 --> 26:16.584
She'll never love me.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.984
- I've been such a fool.
- There, there.

26:19.017 --> 26:21.928
You have always been
a fool, but my fool.

26:21.962 --> 26:24.456
Are you at last ready?

26:24.490 --> 26:25.927
For what?

26:25.961 --> 26:27.528
To make her pay.

26:27.561 --> 26:30.183
Yes.

26:30.218 --> 26:33.639
No one has ever played
with me like Mary Sibley.

26:33.673 --> 26:35.815
And Mary Sibley must pay.

26:35.849 --> 26:37.639
Oh, she will.

26:37.673 --> 26:41.159
First, bring me the rest of her blood.

28:06.055 --> 28:07.365
<i>Let me in.</i>

28:18.727 --> 28:21.253
Leave me alone.

28:31.656 --> 28:34.758
Do they intend to
rip each other's arms off?

28:34.792 --> 28:36.421
It's an odd way to do battle.

28:36.625 --> 28:41.103
No... sometimes when
we fight, it is merely play.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.735
Play?

28:42.769 --> 28:46.255
Mm. Yes, play.
For the sport of it.

28:46.289 --> 28:47.535
Fun. The challenge.

28:47.569 --> 28:49.423
To what end?

28:49.457 --> 28:51.790
To no end. That's
what makes it play.

29:02.416 --> 29:03.726
That hurts me.

29:05.616 --> 29:07.949
In the most delightful way.

29:07.984 --> 29:09.230
Music.

29:09.264 --> 29:11.662
Plays the heart's strings.

29:11.695 --> 29:13.742
Another one of your metaphors?

29:13.775 --> 29:15.822
Yes.

29:15.856 --> 29:19.502
See... man is a metaphor.

29:19.535 --> 29:21.742
Man is a mixed thing.

29:21.776 --> 29:24.494
Man is part matter...

29:24.527 --> 29:26.766
Part spirit.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.781
Part angel.

29:28.815 --> 29:30.413
Part animal.

29:32.046 --> 29:34.732
Mostly animal.

29:34.767 --> 29:36.237
Indeed.

29:39.534 --> 29:40.748
Come.

30:08.525 --> 30:10.411
Look.

30:10.445 --> 30:12.940
Does their devotion not move you?

30:23.374 --> 30:26.060
You praise him
because you fear him.

30:26.094 --> 30:27.180
Okay.

30:27.214 --> 30:28.460
- And...
- Sorry.

30:28.493 --> 30:31.212
I know. We did, too!

30:31.246 --> 30:32.300
- Good day, everyone!
- We all did.

30:32.333 --> 30:33.803
Go.

30:37.389 --> 30:39.020
 <i>Sebastian!</i>

30:43.309 --> 30:46.060
<i>Put it down!</i>

30:48.333 --> 30:51.083
<i>Put it down, you sniveling
son of a whore!</i>

31:08.141 --> 31:09.387
We need more gin.

31:09.421 --> 31:11.147
Yes, and food, I think.

31:11.181 --> 31:15.563
It will prevent hangovers. Ah. Oranges.

31:20.653 --> 31:22.699
Mmm!

31:22.733 --> 31:24.843
Bread.

31:24.877 --> 31:26.859
To soak up the gin.

31:26.893 --> 31:28.202
Ah.

31:31.212 --> 31:34.122
That's butter. The two go together.

31:34.157 --> 31:35.915
More orange.

31:35.948 --> 31:38.410
Orange man.

31:41.292 --> 31:42.858
That'll be two pence.

31:42.892 --> 31:44.585
Mather has the money.

31:44.620 --> 31:46.666
Then Mather can have the orange.

31:48.652 --> 31:49.834
Hey! Sorry. Sorry.

31:49.868 --> 31:52.969
I will buy the oranges.
However many he wants.

31:53.004 --> 31:54.410
The basket.

31:54.444 --> 31:57.226
Yes, I'll take a basket... of oranges.

31:57.260 --> 31:58.538
Thank you. Go!

32:01.644 --> 32:03.146
Oranges, I like.

32:03.180 --> 32:04.938
We shall keep those in our Commonwealth.

32:04.972 --> 32:06.986
- Gin!
- And the bread.

32:07.020 --> 32:08.329
- Bottles of gin!
- And the gin.

32:08.364 --> 32:11.305
Yes. Gin... I like.

32:14.859 --> 32:16.969
I like other things, too.

32:23.179 --> 32:24.841
Ahh.

32:24.876 --> 32:26.377
You've been a bad girl.

32:34.091 --> 32:35.594
Harder.

32:41.419 --> 32:44.297
The high and mighty
Cotton Mather is here.

32:44.331 --> 32:45.705
Alone?

32:45.739 --> 32:48.873
This need to copulate.

32:48.906 --> 32:52.072
To <i>thrive and spurt.</i>

32:52.106 --> 32:55.016
Even animals only rut in season.

32:55.050 --> 32:57.864
This urge besets you night and day.

32:57.898 --> 33:00.424
I just don't understand it.

33:02.698 --> 33:04.744
Let me enlighten you.

33:04.778 --> 33:06.664
Do you recognize him?

33:06.698 --> 33:08.584
No, I don't.

33:08.618 --> 33:13.608
Probably some foreign merchant.

33:13.643 --> 33:15.657
Wealthy.

33:18.090 --> 33:21.576
I think, perhaps, a
reverend is just what we need.

33:27.082 --> 33:29.608
Ladies.

33:55.465 --> 33:59.112
Mm. Such broad shoulders.

33:59.145 --> 34:01.703
And so tall.

34:03.177 --> 34:07.015
I bet those arms could reach
all the way up to heaven.

34:07.049 --> 34:09.447
Come, darling.

34:11.529 --> 34:13.096
Tell me what you like.

34:13.129 --> 34:14.342
What I like?

34:14.378 --> 34:17.382
I like oranges and gin.

34:23.177 --> 34:26.661
No, no. No. I'm
a happily married man.

34:37.001 --> 34:38.663
Reverend!

34:38.697 --> 34:41.126
What a welcome surprise
to find you here.

34:41.159 --> 34:43.655
What are you doing here?

34:43.688 --> 34:46.503
Looking for you, dear friend.

34:46.536 --> 34:48.103
Please... you are needed.

34:48.137 --> 34:52.455
A matter of spiritual urgency.

34:58.377 --> 35:00.295
Dorcas!

35:06.408 --> 35:08.998
Dorcas!

35:12.478 --> 35:14.236
Dorcas!

35:18.408 --> 35:20.774
I'm drunk.

35:20.808 --> 35:23.014
Back for a short time, sir?

35:23.048 --> 35:24.806
Or a long time?

35:29.576 --> 35:31.622
Sir.

35:37.641 --> 35:38.888
Poor Mercy.

35:38.922 --> 35:40.391
She was hardly the only victim

35:40.425 --> 35:43.367
of Mary Sibley's lust for power.

35:43.401 --> 35:46.407
And I knew when I saw her

35:46.441 --> 35:50.119
sparkling like an unpolished diamond

35:50.153 --> 35:51.847
in this den of iniquity,

35:51.882 --> 35:55.687
that I had to free her from
the cruel circumstances

35:55.722 --> 35:59.400
this heartless town
had condemned her to.

36:02.633 --> 36:06.727
You are a good and godly man,

36:06.761 --> 36:08.103
Magistrate Hathorne.

36:08.136 --> 36:09.671
I am.

36:09.704 --> 36:11.591
Surely love is where we find it.

36:11.624 --> 36:13.351
And we have indeed found it.

36:18.473 --> 36:21.095
Or it found us.

36:21.128 --> 36:22.855
Maybe?

36:29.448 --> 36:31.847
Will you help
us tonight, Reverend?

36:34.408 --> 36:36.070
I will try.

36:42.599 --> 36:44.709
"Marriage...

36:44.743 --> 36:49.157
marriage is an honorable estate...

36:53.032 --> 36:56.806
and not to be entered into lightly...

36:56.839 --> 36:59.397
Soberly,

36:59.432 --> 37:00.806
and in the fear of God."

37:00.839 --> 37:02.630
Lovers...

37:02.664 --> 37:07.558
Lovers may be lunatics.

37:07.592 --> 37:12.422
And lovers may be beyond
the reach of reason...

37:12.455 --> 37:15.717
and law.

37:15.752 --> 37:17.509
And true lovers...

37:17.543 --> 37:21.733
true lovers do not desire only love.

37:21.767 --> 37:24.676
They desire...

37:26.951 --> 37:28.677
they desire marriage.

37:28.711 --> 37:30.373
Hm.

37:30.407 --> 37:33.413
For if their love is the truest

37:33.447 --> 37:39.045
and... and noblest love conceivable,

37:39.078 --> 37:42.756
then those lovers are
only relieved by...

37:44.006 --> 37:49.028
by both being happy slaves...

37:49.062 --> 37:51.396
to one another.

38:07.718 --> 38:09.444
You may now kiss the bride.

38:22.469 --> 38:25.058
Do you have any oranges?

38:25.093 --> 38:28.195
We are married.

39:21.187 --> 39:22.306
An assassin.

39:22.339 --> 39:25.346
Have you any idea who I am?

39:25.380 --> 39:27.298
I know exactly who you are.

39:30.691 --> 39:32.257
Your dagger.

39:32.292 --> 39:34.146
I am betrayed!

39:39.140 --> 39:41.538
Only my brother
could have told you

39:41.572 --> 39:43.234
how to forge such a weapon!

39:43.267 --> 39:44.833
It wasn't your brother.

39:44.868 --> 39:46.337
Then it was one of his agents.

39:46.372 --> 39:49.153
But I have no intention of dying.

40:04.739 --> 40:05.761
Aah!

41:30.209 --> 41:32.990
I would have liked one...

41:33.025 --> 41:34.976
more orange.

41:52.385 --> 41:53.663
I've brought the
rest of Mary Sibley's blood,

41:53.697 --> 41:56.095
just as you asked.

42:08.735 --> 42:11.434
Now it begins.
