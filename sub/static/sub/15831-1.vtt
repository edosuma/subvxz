03:15.200 --> 03:18.118
Wonder what reservation
they let him off of.

03:24.209 --> 03:25.709
Excuse me, sir.

03:26.044 --> 03:29.546
But my truck's overheating,
and it's 30 miles to the next station.

03:30.131 --> 03:32.250
Can I get some water out of your cooler,
please, sir?

03:32.350 --> 03:35.469
Maybe you should've stole
a better truck, Tonto.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.762
You got a big mouth, convict.

03:44.862 --> 03:47.523
Take it easy, Chief. He's only joking.

03:48.191 --> 03:50.267
Okay. Can I have the water, please, sir?

03:50.367 --> 03:52.812
Firewater, Tonto?
Is that what you mean?

03:52.912 --> 03:54.404
Firewater, huh?

03:55.406 --> 03:57.074
Hey! Jesus Christ!

03:57.742 --> 03:58.951
Hold it!

03:59.536 --> 04:02.079
He's a state prisoner, you asshole!

04:02.539 --> 04:04.915
Goddamn you two! Knock it off!

04:06.042 --> 04:07.876
Hold it, you asshole!

04:12.966 --> 04:14.716
Get out of the way!

04:19.264 --> 04:21.055
Don't move, convict!

04:31.943 --> 04:33.477
Fuck you!

04:33.577 --> 04:35.696
APO 657, unit 25 to APO 478!

04:36.239 --> 04:37.224
Roger, APO.

04:37.324 --> 04:39.692
Escape in progress! Two officers shot!

04:39.792 --> 04:42.995
Fugitives are driving
a blue flatbed pickup truck!

04:43.204 --> 04:45.614
Two men! One of them is an Indian!

04:45.714 --> 04:48.701
Tall! 6'4", 200 pounds.

04:48.801 --> 04:52.538
The other one's Albert Ganz.
They're armed and dangerous.

04:52.638 --> 04:55.040
God, we need help! Get it here quick!

04:55.140 --> 04:56.876
Say again, 25.

04:56.976 --> 04:59.378
Escape in progress! Two fugitives!

04:59.478 --> 05:01.972
One Indian and prisoner Albert Ganz!

05:45.725 --> 05:48.427
You know, if you let me come over
to your place once in a while,

05:48.527 --> 05:51.104
you could put on a clean shirt
in the morning.

05:52.649 --> 05:56.193
What makes you think
I got any clean shirts at my place?

06:02.867 --> 06:04.368
Great morning.

06:12.543 --> 06:15.879
Yeah. I want her young, tall, thin.

06:16.297 --> 06:18.874
Yeah, real thin.
She's got to have nice legs.

06:18.974 --> 06:21.009
Yeah. Legs are important.

06:21.761 --> 06:24.964
No, no jeans. I don't like jeans.
Jeans are cheap.

06:25.064 --> 06:28.058
A dress. Yeah, a nice summer dress.

06:28.351 --> 06:30.219
I want her fresh, you know?

06:30.319 --> 06:32.479
No, I know you don't get it.

06:32.730 --> 06:34.723
Hey, what about me?

06:34.823 --> 06:37.526
Yeah. And I need one more
for my friend.

06:38.069 --> 06:40.070
Now, make her an Indian.

06:40.655 --> 06:43.407
No, not with a turban.
You know, a squaw.

06:44.409 --> 06:45.409
Yeah.

06:45.994 --> 06:47.403
It'll be the Walden hotel.

06:47.503 --> 06:49.279
That's 3rd, near Broadway.

06:49.379 --> 06:52.833
And you tell them to ask for Polson.

06:53.001 --> 06:54.410
G.P. Polson.

06:54.510 --> 06:56.712
Yeah. P-O-L-S-O-N.

06:57.588 --> 06:59.589
Just be a couple of hours.

06:59.966 --> 07:01.133
Right.

07:19.110 --> 07:21.311
That's a fairly crummy way
to start a morning.

07:21.411 --> 07:23.147
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.

07:23.247 --> 07:24.815
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.

07:24.915 --> 07:27.155
Maybe you don't know what the hell
you're talking about!

07:27.292 --> 07:30.871
Jack, when you start with that attitude,
it's like I don't even know who you are.

07:31.039 --> 07:34.458
What do you want to know?
And what difference does it make?

07:34.625 --> 07:36.385
I make you feel good,
you make me feel good.

07:36.510 --> 07:38.787
Now, what the hell more do you want
from a guy?

07:38.887 --> 07:40.964
I wish you'd stop trying
to make me mad.

07:41.424 --> 07:44.176
I don't have time for this.
I got to go to work.

08:00.234 --> 08:02.152
You really are hopeless.

08:03.279 --> 08:05.322
That's what I always say.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.566
Call me later.

08:07.666 --> 08:09.068
- You want me to?
- Yeah.

08:09.168 --> 08:11.570
Good. Thanks for the coffee.

08:11.670 --> 08:12.670
Okay.

08:13.664 --> 08:14.740
- Oh, hey, Jack.
- Yeah.

08:14.840 --> 08:15.949
Here, take this.

08:16.049 --> 08:18.714
It's cold as hell out these mornings,
and you know what the man said.

08:18.814 --> 08:19.711
No.

08:19.811 --> 08:24.132
"The coldest winter I ever spent was
a summer I spent in San Francisco."

09:26.070 --> 09:27.576
No, we ain't going by the store again.

09:27.676 --> 09:30.816
I told you a million fucking times,
we start slow, we save a little bit.

09:30.916 --> 09:33.156
- We go with that way.
- But I liked that carpet we saw.

09:33.411 --> 09:34.486
We can't afford it.

09:34.586 --> 09:36.697
Don't remind me.
I know we can't afford it.

09:36.797 --> 09:38.073
I'm just saying I liked it.

09:38.173 --> 09:39.675
You don't have to get crabby about it.

09:39.775 --> 09:42.327
What do you want me to do?
Go out and steal for the money?

09:42.427 --> 09:45.172
I hated the color anyway.
The color sucked.

09:46.632 --> 09:47.632
Wait.

09:50.553 --> 09:52.796
- Surprise, Luther.
- What do you want?

09:52.896 --> 09:55.296
- I thought you were locked up.
- I want the money, asshole.

09:55.399 --> 09:57.146
What do you think?
The money that Reggie hid.

09:57.246 --> 09:58.802
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:58.902 --> 10:00.971
Want that Indian to snap her neck?

10:01.071 --> 10:04.099
Instead of worrying about Reggie,
you better start worrying about me.

10:04.199 --> 10:06.143
Don't give me this. We were partners!

10:06.243 --> 10:07.436
Go ahead, Billy. Break it.

10:07.536 --> 10:09.688
No! Don't hurt her.

10:09.788 --> 10:11.823
- I can get you the money.
- When?

10:11.949 --> 10:14.401
I can't get it till Monday. Honest.

10:14.501 --> 10:15.569
Little chickenshit...

10:15.669 --> 10:18.049
Honest! The place we got it stashed
doesn't open till Monday.

10:18.149 --> 10:20.824
I can't get it till then.
Monday morning. That's when it opens.

10:20.924 --> 10:23.793
After that, I'll get the money right to you.

10:27.632 --> 10:29.799
I always liked you, Luther.

10:30.176 --> 10:33.178
You were always a lot of fun
to hang out with.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.297
We're gonna keep her.

10:35.397 --> 10:37.049
Come on. You can trust me.

10:37.149 --> 10:39.142
And if you mess with us,

10:39.685 --> 10:42.512
I'll put holes in her
you never even thought of.

10:42.612 --> 10:43.931
Go on, get the fuck out of here.

10:44.031 --> 10:45.849
Ganz, please.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.442
Don't fuck up.

10:47.652 --> 10:48.648
Ganz!

10:48.748 --> 10:50.237
- Luther!
- Rosie!

11:17.181 --> 11:19.174
Hey, Algren, need any backup?

11:19.274 --> 11:21.510
No, Jack, please.
You make me nervous.

11:21.610 --> 11:22.719
You know that.

11:22.819 --> 11:25.097
Your wife makes you nervous, not me.

11:25.197 --> 11:27.182
The radio said
you guys had something on.

11:27.282 --> 11:28.274
Not much, Jack.

11:28.374 --> 11:30.936
A salesman named Polson
had his credit cards lifted.

11:31.036 --> 11:33.605
One of Polson's cards
rented that green coupe over there.

11:33.705 --> 11:36.366
Not much for a big guy like you, Cates.

11:36.742 --> 11:38.443
Oh, it's just a laugher, huh, Van?

11:38.543 --> 11:40.112
It's five-and-dime, Jack.

11:40.212 --> 11:42.020
Polson said a kid
with a switchblade mugged him

11:42.120 --> 11:43.699
and took off on a motorcycle.

11:43.799 --> 11:46.451
Well, you guys are experts
at taking knives away from teenagers.

11:46.551 --> 11:49.254
Yeah, we are, so keep out of it.
We don't need any big artillery.

11:49.380 --> 11:53.550
Well, I'm just trying to help out, Van.
I love to watch pros work.

11:53.968 --> 11:55.460
I don't need your help, Cates.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.963
Hey, Jack, you want to come in,
that's fine.

11:58.063 --> 12:00.590
You stake out the lobby.
How's the car running?

12:00.690 --> 12:02.426
Great. How's the wife?

12:02.526 --> 12:04.102
Mean as a snake.

12:05.396 --> 12:06.896
Nice paint job.

12:18.784 --> 12:20.902
- Hello. We're looking...
- You guys were in last week.

12:21.002 --> 12:23.033
You better ask around.
I'm not supposed to be hassled.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.197
I got friends.

12:24.297 --> 12:26.004
Park your tongue for a second,
sweet pants.

12:26.104 --> 12:27.245
We just want to search a room.

12:27.345 --> 12:29.268
- Not unless you got a warrant, babyface.
- Actually...

12:29.368 --> 12:30.597
Hey, maybe you should've been
a lawyer

12:30.697 --> 12:33.332
instead of a dumb skirt working behind
a cash register, huh?

12:33.432 --> 12:34.875
Come on, what the shit is this?

12:34.975 --> 12:36.569
- Jack, don't do that.
- Don't worry about that, now.

12:36.669 --> 12:38.211
We're looking for a man
by the name of Polson.

12:38.311 --> 12:39.546
"Polson. Room 27."

12:39.646 --> 12:41.548
Okay, big deal. Get it over with.

12:41.648 --> 12:42.883
Is he alone?

12:42.983 --> 12:45.469
A couple girls went up to visit him
about an hour ago.

12:45.569 --> 12:46.561
Thank you.

12:46.661 --> 12:47.804
You guys be careful.

12:47.904 --> 12:49.890
Yeah, and like we said,
you stake out the lobby.

12:49.990 --> 12:51.649
All right, Vinnie.

12:52.818 --> 12:55.528
- I'll let you handle it, Al.
- Thank you.

13:30.314 --> 13:34.267
Hey, this isn't exactly
my goddamn life's ambition, you know.

13:34.367 --> 13:35.977
It's like a part-time thing.

13:36.077 --> 13:38.253
I'm trying to get the money together
to send for my kid.

13:38.353 --> 13:40.657
He's been staying with his granny.

13:41.409 --> 13:43.910
You don't want to hear
that personal crap anyway.

13:44.078 --> 13:46.037
Are you listening to me?

13:51.335 --> 13:52.331
Hey.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.838
Did you hear a goddamn word I said?

14:01.011 --> 14:02.011
So...

14:02.721 --> 14:04.764
How much money you got left?

14:18.821 --> 14:21.072
Hi, Liz. How you doing? It's me.

14:21.490 --> 14:22.699
What's going on?

14:23.951 --> 14:26.611
Nothing. Just a couple of cops.
What else is new?

14:26.711 --> 14:28.371
How was your date?

14:28.873 --> 14:30.198
You're kidding.

14:30.298 --> 14:33.084
Liz, you gotta stop sitting still
for that kind of shit.

14:34.003 --> 14:36.087
Yeah. Put him in his place.

14:59.695 --> 15:01.905
You're gonna ask who it is. All right?

15:06.368 --> 15:07.368
Ask.

15:07.627 --> 15:09.496
- Who is it?
- Police. Open up.

15:10.164 --> 15:11.323
What do you want?

15:11.423 --> 15:13.416
Police business. Open up right now!

15:13.876 --> 15:15.168
Keep on stalling.

15:15.377 --> 15:17.537
Hang on a second.
I gotta put something on.

15:17.637 --> 15:18.880
Hold on.

15:31.310 --> 15:34.771
You listen.
When I tell you to jump, you jump.

15:44.782 --> 15:46.449
Call for help now!

15:50.079 --> 15:51.879
Operator!

16:45.175 --> 16:47.677
Jack. There are two of them, Jack!

16:58.897 --> 17:00.546
Stay here. Stay down.
Check out the lobby.

17:00.646 --> 17:03.526
It's an emergency!
They're fighting upstairs!

17:04.194 --> 17:05.954
Operator, did you get through
to the police?

17:06.155 --> 17:08.031
Put down that goddamn phone, lady.

17:08.365 --> 17:09.773
You drop the phone!

17:09.874 --> 17:12.109
- Drop that phone!
- Don't hurt me, please!

17:12.210 --> 17:13.536
Oh, my God!

17:19.460 --> 17:21.127
Please, let me go!

17:22.421 --> 17:24.005
Please, let me go.

17:25.590 --> 17:27.083
Billy, bring her out.

17:27.183 --> 17:28.968
He ain't gonna shoot.

17:32.681 --> 17:33.882
Come on!

17:33.982 --> 17:35.183
No! No!

17:47.905 --> 17:49.155
Shut up!

17:51.575 --> 17:52.575
No!

17:53.494 --> 17:54.869
Oh, my God!

18:07.424 --> 18:08.424
No!

18:13.806 --> 18:17.892
You! Toss me that goddamn piece,
and he won't waste him.

18:19.269 --> 18:21.437
Don't do it, Jack.
Don't give him the gun.

18:22.523 --> 18:24.941
God damn it, Jack! Don't you do it!

18:30.489 --> 18:32.281
Don't do that for me.

18:55.097 --> 18:56.472
Get the car.

19:31.842 --> 19:33.092
Nice gun.

20:05.501 --> 20:08.077
- What happened?
- Just read the fucking report!

20:08.177 --> 20:10.705
Two cops get blown away
by a credit card booster?

20:10.805 --> 20:12.665
- That don't figure.
- No shit.

20:12.765 --> 20:14.250
Yeah, and those guys were good cops.

20:14.350 --> 20:16.419
Hell, yes.
They were good cops who fucked up.

20:16.519 --> 20:17.816
They just got careless, that's all.

20:17.916 --> 20:19.110
Yeah, that's what you say, Cates.

20:19.210 --> 20:22.217
- Yeah, that's what I say!
- That's what you always say.

20:22.317 --> 20:24.513
The way you tell it,
we're always the ones that fuck up.

20:24.613 --> 20:25.929
The truth hurts, don't it, buddy?

20:26.029 --> 20:28.123
- Yeah, but, Jack, it don't figure.
- It don't figure.

20:28.223 --> 20:30.767
- Can I borrow a piece?
- Yeah, okay, I'll see what I can do.

20:30.867 --> 20:33.410
When somebody steals your gun,
you're supposed to file a report.

20:33.510 --> 20:34.938
Just don't give me a bunch of crap.

20:35.038 --> 20:38.399
Well, I guess when two cops die
because you fucked up...

20:38.499 --> 20:40.860
Jesus! Cool down! Knock it off!
Knock it off!

20:40.960 --> 20:43.871
It's not gonna bring them back!
You know better!

20:44.373 --> 20:46.449
Look, Cates,
I want to see you right away.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.284
We got a lot to talk about!

20:48.384 --> 20:50.286
God damn it, do you read me, Cates?

20:50.386 --> 20:52.288
Yeah, I hear you. Your voice carries.

20:52.388 --> 20:53.840
Five minutes.

20:57.386 --> 20:59.629
- Ruth!
- They're still wet.

20:59.729 --> 21:01.881
A lot of people getting shot
with.44s lately.

21:01.981 --> 21:04.217
Last year,
it was Saturday night specials.

21:04.317 --> 21:05.844
Now it's the heavy stuff.

21:05.944 --> 21:07.732
People must be getting madder
about something.

21:07.832 --> 21:09.056
You're an accessory to Murder One,

21:09.156 --> 21:10.777
so you're gonna have to do
a whole lot better

21:10.877 --> 21:13.242
- than what you've got down here, honey.
- Give me a break, huh?

21:13.342 --> 21:14.519
- Cates!
- Yeah!

21:14.619 --> 21:17.384
Got a print from the hotel room, the
guy's real name is Ganz, Albert Ganz.

21:17.484 --> 21:20.066
He headed from back east, but he
worked out here a few years back.

21:20.166 --> 21:21.192
Armed robbery.

21:21.292 --> 21:25.029
Broke out of prison a couple of days ago
and capped a couple of the guards.

21:25.129 --> 21:27.031
A real animal. Wait till you see this.

21:27.131 --> 21:28.749
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:29.668 --> 21:31.369
Did he give you a return match?

21:31.469 --> 21:32.537
He wasn't interested.

21:32.637 --> 21:34.261
Maybe he didn't
like the merchandise, huh?

21:34.361 --> 21:36.374
- Fuck you.
- I'll take a rain check on that, huh?

21:36.474 --> 21:38.484
- This'll interest you, Jack.
- Yeah, what do you got?

21:38.584 --> 21:39.711
We got something from your gun,

21:39.811 --> 21:41.392
and this is from the first weapon
Ganz used.

21:41.492 --> 21:42.486
Wait a minute. I don't get this.

21:42.586 --> 21:45.425
Here. It's a perfect match from
the markings from the first gun he used.

21:45.525 --> 21:48.386
But it's not from the Walden hotel.
Fired six hours earlier,

21:48.486 --> 21:50.221
point blank range,
right between the eyes.

21:50.321 --> 21:51.890
Found him on a park bench.

21:51.990 --> 21:54.767
You know, there are some
very bad people out there in the world.

21:54.867 --> 21:56.083
Yeah, look at it this way, Ruth.

21:56.183 --> 21:58.521
If there weren't,
what the hell would we have to do, huh?

21:58.621 --> 22:01.149
So anyway, I got there.
He took me down.

22:01.249 --> 22:02.525
He started watching television,

22:02.625 --> 22:05.403
and then you sensational people
started banging on the door.

22:05.503 --> 22:06.738
That's it.

22:06.838 --> 22:09.198
Except that I think he's gonna
give you guys a hard time.

22:09.298 --> 22:10.909
What makes you think so?

22:11.009 --> 22:13.703
I just think he likes shooting cops
a lot more than getting laid.

22:13.803 --> 22:15.622
- Jack, check it out.
- What do you got?

22:15.722 --> 22:17.592
The stuff from his hotel.
Every last bit of it.

22:17.692 --> 22:20.843
- The big guy's room was empty.
- All right, let's go through it.

22:24.806 --> 22:27.759
A speedloader.
This guy's got a.44 like yours, Jack.

22:27.859 --> 22:28.927
Jesus.

22:29.027 --> 22:31.095
This cat is serious about his artillery.

22:31.195 --> 22:33.397
- Here's the files.
- Oh, thanks.

22:34.358 --> 22:35.433
Billy Bear, huh?

22:35.533 --> 22:36.913
Yeah, big Indian from the East Bay.

22:37.013 --> 22:38.353
Worked with Ganz a few years back,

22:38.453 --> 22:39.852
and he sprung him from the road gang.

22:39.952 --> 22:41.940
- Who's this guy?
- Wong. Henry Wong.

22:42.040 --> 22:43.274
He was in on the same job.

22:43.374 --> 22:45.673
Kehoe, come here. Come here.
I want to show you something.

22:45.773 --> 22:48.955
Come here. Look at this. Look at this.

22:50.540 --> 22:52.541
Now, tell me. The same guy.

22:53.043 --> 22:54.369
Hey, Dick fucking Tracy.

22:54.469 --> 22:56.562
All right, I'm gonna want to talk to
one of these guys.

22:56.662 --> 22:59.274
- Any of them walking around?
- One of the gang's still in the slam.

22:59.390 --> 23:00.758
Good. Good.

23:01.343 --> 23:04.220
- Get in here, Cates!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

23:08.266 --> 23:10.059
Speedloader. Kehoe!

23:12.771 --> 23:15.932
I want to be left alone on this one.
Al was killed with my gun.

23:16.032 --> 23:19.686
Jack, there's an official
department policy about cop killings.

23:19.786 --> 23:22.021
Now, cop killers represent
a special priority,

23:22.121 --> 23:24.524
because any man crazy enough
to kill a cop

23:24.624 --> 23:26.442
is a greater threat
to an unarmed civilian.

23:26.542 --> 23:27.652
- Right.
- In other words,

23:27.752 --> 23:30.029
we can't seem like
we're in the revenge business.

23:30.129 --> 23:31.999
And we all know
the truth's a little different.

23:32.099 --> 23:33.090
Yeah?

23:33.750 --> 23:36.160
Anything's bothering you
besides losing your gun?

23:36.260 --> 23:38.162
Yeah, it bothers me
when cops get killed.

23:38.262 --> 23:39.747
I don't like that.

23:39.847 --> 23:41.874
Then you might be
a little more of a team player

23:41.974 --> 23:43.793
and a little less of a hot dog on this one.

23:43.893 --> 23:46.713
Hot dogging's been
working real well so far.

23:46.813 --> 23:48.047
Besides, I got a lead.

23:48.147 --> 23:50.599
Okay. You got to do things
your own way?

23:50.767 --> 23:51.767
Fine.

23:51.901 --> 23:54.345
Now, you nail this guy
and make us all look good,

23:54.445 --> 23:55.805
but you better watch your ass,

23:55.905 --> 23:57.890
because everybody's watching
on this one.

23:57.990 --> 24:01.444
If you screw up, I can promise you,
you're going down.

24:01.987 --> 24:06.115
Boy, you know how to send a guy out
with a real great attitude, boss.

24:37.064 --> 24:38.647
Those days are over

24:38.815 --> 24:42.610
You don't have to sell your body
to the night

24:43.278 --> 24:44.653
I'm here to see Reggie Hammond.

24:44.988 --> 24:47.899
- He's in 18. You want company?
- No, thank you.

24:47.999 --> 24:50.618
You don't have to put on the red light

24:50.869 --> 24:52.445
Those days are over

24:52.545 --> 24:56.499
You don't have to sell your body
to the night

24:57.042 --> 24:58.417
Roxanne

25:00.170 --> 25:03.672
You don't have to put on the red light

25:05.509 --> 25:07.718
Walk the streets for money

25:08.011 --> 25:12.139
You don't even care
if it's wrong or if it's right

25:12.432 --> 25:13.832
Roxanne

25:15.685 --> 25:18.471
You don't have to work for money...

25:18.571 --> 25:19.722
Is that Hammond?

25:19.822 --> 25:22.642
You don't have to sell your body
to the night

25:22.742 --> 25:23.734
Hammond!

25:23.834 --> 25:25.645
Put on the red light

25:25.745 --> 25:28.447
Roxanne, put on the red light

25:28.990 --> 25:30.491
Roxanne, put on the...

25:30.617 --> 25:31.867
Hammond!

25:36.123 --> 25:38.449
- You got a name, cop?
- Let's try Cates.

25:38.549 --> 25:41.794
Come on, I want to talk to you in private.

25:43.255 --> 25:44.747
Look, Hammond, I know all about you.

25:44.847 --> 25:47.208
You're single,
you got no fixed address, no relatives.

25:47.308 --> 25:48.960
One previous conviction,
armed robbery.

25:49.060 --> 25:50.559
Six months to go on
a three-year sentence.

25:50.659 --> 25:52.588
- Is that right?
- So what, man?

25:52.688 --> 25:55.099
- You gonna write my life story?
- Not likely, Reggie.

25:56.434 --> 25:58.435
Maybe I just need a little help, huh?

26:01.189 --> 26:02.735
That's Henry Wong,
an old friend of mine.

26:02.835 --> 26:04.517
- He's looked better.
- That's right.

26:04.617 --> 26:05.726
Yeah, well, look, man,

26:05.826 --> 26:08.023
I've been in this goddamn cell
for two and a half years

26:08.123 --> 26:09.825
and I'm getting out
in six months, all right?

26:09.925 --> 26:11.550
I ain't gonna do nothing
to fuck myself up.

26:11.666 --> 26:14.068
But if you came here
to find out something from me,

26:14.168 --> 26:15.303
you come to the wrong person,

26:15.403 --> 26:17.405
'cause I don't fuck
my old friends over, man.

26:17.505 --> 26:18.990
That's too bad, Reggie.

26:19.090 --> 26:21.458
I thought maybe you were a smart boy.

26:22.127 --> 26:25.421
But I guess if you were real smart,
you wouldn't be a convict.

26:26.256 --> 26:28.632
Yeah, I guess a second-rater like you
would be no help

26:28.758 --> 26:31.335
- with a hard case like Ganz.
- Ganz?

26:31.435 --> 26:33.296
- Right.
- Man, Ganz is in jail.

26:33.396 --> 26:35.184
He's gonna be there
two years after I get out.

26:35.284 --> 26:37.631
Didn't work out that way, Reggie.
A big Indian busted him out.

26:37.731 --> 26:39.677
They capped two guards
on a road gang.

26:39.777 --> 26:41.270
See you later.

26:42.606 --> 26:44.273
- Yo, Cates.
- Yeah?

26:45.066 --> 26:47.852
I can help you get Ganz,
but you gotta get me out of here first.

26:47.952 --> 26:49.228
You're crazy.

26:49.328 --> 26:51.912
I'm serious. I can help you get him,
but I gotta be on the street.

26:52.012 --> 26:53.900
What's the big deal being on the street?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.910
Let's just say I got a lot to protect,
all right?

26:56.010 --> 26:57.445
I want Ganz as bad as you.

26:57.545 --> 26:59.955
- Neither one of us ain't got no time.
- Bullshit!

27:00.081 --> 27:02.033
No, that's serious shit!

27:02.133 --> 27:04.084
You want Ganz, get me out of here.

27:05.545 --> 27:07.713
I'll think about it, Reggie.

27:08.465 --> 27:09.632
Cates.

27:10.592 --> 27:13.344
Cates!
You gotta get me out of here, man!

27:14.179 --> 27:15.971
Get me out of here, Cates!

27:17.057 --> 27:18.224
Cates!

27:20.936 --> 27:22.186
Fuck you!

27:32.614 --> 27:34.156
Let me borrow your pen, Bob.

27:34.950 --> 27:37.826
- You gonna use your own name?
- Shit, no.

27:42.707 --> 27:45.368
Jack, if all this comes down,
you don't know me.

27:45.468 --> 27:48.120
I'm not gonna burn for you.
And I'll tell you something else.

27:48.220 --> 27:51.423
If it all comes down,
your ass is new-mown grass.

27:51.925 --> 27:54.043
All right. You got him for 48 hours.

27:54.143 --> 27:55.511
Sure thing.

27:55.971 --> 27:59.006
You know, you got a big career
as a forger if you decide to go that way.

27:59.106 --> 28:00.383
Thank you, Bob.

28:00.483 --> 28:02.184
I'll ring security.

28:12.612 --> 28:14.780
Wouldn't talk down to you

28:15.156 --> 28:16.365
Hammond.

28:17.325 --> 28:18.776
Okay, send him through.

28:18.876 --> 28:21.654
- You gotta sign for him.
- Yeah. Sure thing.

28:21.754 --> 28:23.872
- He's all yours.
- All right.

28:24.040 --> 28:26.792
See how you needed me a little more
than you thought, huh, Mr. Cates?

28:26.892 --> 28:28.590
I decided you're
as good a chance as I got.

28:28.690 --> 28:30.788
That shows you how desperate I am.

28:30.888 --> 28:32.957
This prison give out $400 suits?

28:33.057 --> 28:35.418
$957, and I wore this shit in.

28:35.518 --> 28:37.628
We're after a killer,
not a bunch of hookers.

28:37.728 --> 28:38.924
Yeah, well, I got a reputation

28:39.024 --> 28:40.645
for looking real nice
with the ladies, man.

28:40.745 --> 28:43.259
Maybe when we get out,
I can take you to a couple of spots,

28:43.359 --> 28:45.820
we can get you dressed up,
and we can go on a little pussy hunt.

28:45.920 --> 28:48.063
I don't want to hear your jive.

28:48.356 --> 28:50.349
Already got that department
taken care of.

28:50.449 --> 28:52.268
- You got a lady, Cates?
- Yeah.

28:52.368 --> 28:54.686
You know, the generosity of women
never ceases to amaze me.

28:54.786 --> 28:55.813
You know that?

28:55.913 --> 28:59.608
Hey, don't even try this shit, man.
I don't work like this. No deal.

28:59.708 --> 29:02.661
Listen, we ain't got no deal.
I own your ass!

29:03.121 --> 29:05.489
Ain't no goddamn way
to start a partnership.

29:05.589 --> 29:06.824
Now, get this.

29:06.924 --> 29:09.452
We ain't partners, we ain't brothers,
and we ain't friends!

29:09.552 --> 29:11.177
I'm putting you down
and keeping you down

29:11.277 --> 29:12.997
until Ganz is locked up or dead.

29:13.097 --> 29:16.925
And if Ganz gets away,
you're gonna be sorry you ever met me!

29:18.928 --> 29:20.596
I'm already sorry.

29:31.107 --> 29:32.850
- This your car, man?
- Yeah.

29:32.950 --> 29:34.977
Look like you bought it off
one of the brothers.

29:35.077 --> 29:37.772
All right, I did my part and I got you out,
so now you do yours.

29:37.872 --> 29:38.864
Where we going?

29:38.964 --> 29:40.274
We gotta go see a guy named Luther.

29:40.374 --> 29:41.546
Ganz will be going to see him soon.

29:41.646 --> 29:42.817
We ain't got that much time, though.

29:42.917 --> 29:45.488
- Is Luther part of the gang?
- What gang you talking about, Jack?

29:45.588 --> 29:47.365
Hey, I can read a police file, shithead.

29:47.465 --> 29:48.824
Quit calling me Jack.

29:48.924 --> 29:51.386
It's just an expression, all right?
I don't mean nothing by it.

29:51.486 --> 29:53.496
I don't give a damn.
It happens to be my name.

29:53.596 --> 29:54.893
What the hell you complaining for?

29:54.993 --> 29:58.550
- At least nobody calling you shithead.
- I may call you worse than that.

30:27.956 --> 30:29.911
Right up there, man,
and don't knock on the door.

30:30.011 --> 30:31.450
He ain't expecting no company.

30:31.550 --> 30:33.244
Luther ain't very stable, man.

30:33.344 --> 30:36.092
And I don't want you getting shot
before you get a chance to help me.

30:36.192 --> 30:38.173
Oh, I'm helping you, huh?

30:38.800 --> 30:40.968
Slow down. Right there, 232.

30:43.972 --> 30:45.756
What's the chances he's packed?

30:45.856 --> 30:47.214
Been a while since I worked with him.

30:47.314 --> 30:49.093
I'd say chances are
probably about 100%.

30:49.193 --> 30:50.857
You better leave me a gun
or something, man.

30:50.957 --> 30:53.647
I ain't sitting out here without no gun.

30:54.274 --> 30:56.066
Sure thing, asshole.

30:56.359 --> 30:58.277
Now, you just hang on.

31:00.530 --> 31:03.991
Hope this big move of yours
turns out to be something.

31:56.294 --> 31:57.411
What's happening, Luther?

31:57.511 --> 31:59.371
I'm sorry about the door, man.
Did that hurt?

31:59.471 --> 32:02.591
It looked real painful
when you slammed into it.

32:04.344 --> 32:07.304
Luther, I'm talking to you.
Luther. Luther!

32:07.514 --> 32:10.265
Hammond! Drop that goddamn gun!

32:10.642 --> 32:12.781
Hey, man, that's a dangerous game
you're playing, man.

32:12.881 --> 32:14.317
Don't point that gun at me, all right?

32:14.417 --> 32:16.555
Don't point your goddamn gun at me,
all right?

32:16.655 --> 32:18.941
Hand me that gun or you're dead.

32:38.253 --> 32:40.329
I'm looking for Ganz. Where is he?

32:40.429 --> 32:42.756
Ganz? Haven't seen him for years.

32:43.299 --> 32:44.416
That's the truth.

32:44.516 --> 32:46.335
Look, asshole,
you just took a shot at me.

32:46.435 --> 32:48.637
I think you do know where Ganz is.

32:48.930 --> 32:51.306
Who gives a fuck what you think?

32:56.938 --> 32:59.390
Yo, Luther, man,
you better tell this boy something.

32:59.490 --> 33:02.067
He's having a ball with this car door.

33:05.822 --> 33:08.323
Luther! Are you angry with me?

33:09.158 --> 33:11.569
I don't know what
you're smiling at, watermelon.

33:11.669 --> 33:14.280
Your big move just turned out to be shit.

33:14.380 --> 33:16.407
All right, all right, all right!

33:16.507 --> 33:19.410
Yeah, if I defend myself,
I'm resisting arrest, right?

33:19.510 --> 33:21.787
Officer, I want to make
a citizen's arrest!

33:21.887 --> 33:23.080
Shut up!

33:23.180 --> 33:24.582
What you got here, Jack?

33:24.682 --> 33:27.084
I got a punk here
carrying a concealed weapon...

33:27.184 --> 33:28.586
All you cops are faggots!

33:28.686 --> 33:30.345
Resisting arrest.

33:30.513 --> 33:32.931
I'll think up some more,
file a report tomorrow.

33:33.182 --> 33:35.759
- I bet you will.
- Yeah, I will. Get him out of here.

33:35.859 --> 33:37.886
Man, give me a 9:00 wake-up call.

33:37.986 --> 33:39.054
Good-bye, Luther!

33:39.154 --> 33:41.098
I don't need a friend like you, Reggie!

33:41.198 --> 33:44.143
When do I get my phone call?
Let me get my lawyer here!

33:44.243 --> 33:46.270
You're gonna be in trouble!

33:46.370 --> 33:47.946
Stay right here.

33:48.364 --> 33:51.700
- Okay?
- Get your hands off me!

33:53.870 --> 33:57.873
I'm not gonna take this from you.
That's no way to treat a lady.

34:00.960 --> 34:02.502
No, you're not.

34:05.882 --> 34:07.174
Excuse me, ladies,

34:07.300 --> 34:09.293
you seem to be
in some need of assistance.

34:09.393 --> 34:10.460
We've got enough problems.

34:10.561 --> 34:11.797
We don't need some tight-assed,

34:11.898 --> 34:14.297
court-appointed lawyer
trying to bullshit us.

34:14.398 --> 34:16.300
Sweetheart, I'm not here to bullshit you.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.063
I don't know whether or not
you ladies know,

34:18.164 --> 34:19.364
but the city's coming down on people

34:19.464 --> 34:21.605
involved with
unlawful carnal knowledge.

34:23.733 --> 34:24.775
Hello?

34:25.318 --> 34:27.777
This is Jack Cates. Any messages?

34:29.280 --> 34:30.606
Oh, just one.

34:30.706 --> 34:33.025
Some lady called, says
she's a little hotheaded sometimes,

34:33.125 --> 34:35.577
but she still wants
her occasional roommate.

34:35.745 --> 34:38.781
She says she'd like to talk it over
tonight after she gets off work,

34:38.880 --> 34:40.081
if it's humanly possible.

34:40.248 --> 34:41.792
Look, Elaine, I...

34:42.752 --> 34:44.453
I've got some stuff to do tonight.

34:44.553 --> 34:46.933
I'm not going to be able to come by.
I don't know when I can.

34:47.033 --> 34:47.998
Come on, Jack.

34:48.098 --> 34:50.167
You're making me work
too goddamn hard at this!

34:50.266 --> 34:51.335
Listen, god damn it.

34:51.435 --> 34:53.469
If you think I'm happy about it,
you're nuts!

34:53.596 --> 34:55.184
I just got a few things to take care of.

34:55.284 --> 34:57.284
This is not the way
people who care about each other

34:57.384 --> 34:59.226
are supposed to behave!

35:02.939 --> 35:03.939
Shit!

35:04.198 --> 35:06.558
I'm trying to say
you're both going to do a little time,

35:06.658 --> 35:08.443
about 30 days each.

35:08.945 --> 35:11.397
Unless, of course,
we talk some real business.

35:11.497 --> 35:14.358
So where do you want to do it, honey?
Want to hop up on the counter?

35:14.458 --> 35:16.756
No. We can go in this room over here,
next to the bathroom.

35:16.856 --> 35:18.088
- Give me a break.
- I'm dead serious.

35:18.188 --> 35:19.319
Come on, we're on the move. Let's go!

35:19.419 --> 35:21.531
Man, you know how close I was
to getting some trim just now,

35:21.631 --> 35:22.457
and you fucked it up?

35:22.557 --> 35:23.951
Hey, well, my ass bleeds for you.

35:24.051 --> 35:26.328
I didn't get you out
so you could go on a trim hunt.

35:26.428 --> 35:27.705
Stop moaning.

35:27.805 --> 35:30.162
You know, speaking of moaning,
my stomach is starting to growl.

35:30.262 --> 35:32.267
- We better go get something to eat.
- We eat when I say we eat.

35:32.367 --> 35:34.545
Hey, now, that's bullshit.
That's the last straw, all right?

35:34.645 --> 35:35.796
I want some food now.

35:35.896 --> 35:38.132
If you don't like it,
you take me back to the penitentiary

35:38.232 --> 35:39.996
and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye,
all right?

35:40.096 --> 35:41.051
You took me out here,

35:41.151 --> 35:43.203
you've been treating me like shit
since we first left,

35:43.303 --> 35:44.656
and I want some food in a nice place,

35:44.756 --> 35:46.724
in a nice atmosphere,
with some good people.

35:46.824 --> 35:48.692
Okay, hold it. I'm hungry.

35:49.402 --> 35:51.895
Let's go get something to eat.
I know a place, all right?

35:51.995 --> 35:53.354
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

35:53.454 --> 35:56.032
I want some mandolins
and some violins.

35:57.326 --> 35:58.326
Yeah!

35:59.829 --> 36:01.955
There's your goddamn dinner.

36:02.290 --> 36:03.498
Come on.

36:08.504 --> 36:10.419
Who was that you called
back on the phone, Jack?

36:10.519 --> 36:12.716
None of your goddamn business.

36:12.884 --> 36:15.294
Just get in the car
and keep your mouth shut.

36:15.394 --> 36:16.854
Come on, man, I think it was your lady.

36:16.954 --> 36:18.332
Why don't you tell me
something about her?

36:18.432 --> 36:19.798
What's her problem, besides you?

36:19.898 --> 36:23.343
She got the same problem
as half the goddamn population.

36:23.443 --> 36:25.971
Can't get a job she's trained for,
and it pisses her off.

36:26.071 --> 36:28.891
She's bitching all the time.
What the fuck do you care?

36:28.991 --> 36:30.601
Hey, man, I'm in jail, remember that?

36:30.701 --> 36:33.103
I'm surrounded by guys
wearing blue suits 24 hours a day.

36:33.203 --> 36:34.318
I ain't built for that shit.

36:34.418 --> 36:37.991
Yeah? The clothes you wear,
you look like you'd love it.

36:39.368 --> 36:41.570
All right, where to, convict?

36:41.670 --> 36:44.164
Mission District, catch us an Indian.

37:05.520 --> 37:07.289
Yo, man,
tell me about this girlfriend of yours.

37:07.389 --> 37:08.676
When was the last time
you got with her?

37:08.776 --> 37:10.182
I don't give out details.

37:10.282 --> 37:12.351
Come on, man.
I've been in prison for three years.

37:12.451 --> 37:13.891
I'm tired of hearing lies about pussy.

37:13.991 --> 37:15.553
Man, when was it, last week,
the week before?

37:15.653 --> 37:16.605
Last night.

37:16.705 --> 37:17.815
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:17.915 --> 37:19.574
- Was it fun?
- Yeah.

37:21.244 --> 37:24.412
Christ. Then in the morning,
we got in a fucking argument.

37:24.997 --> 37:27.282
At least you took care of business first,
right, Jack?

37:27.382 --> 37:28.408
Right.

37:28.508 --> 37:31.545
Yo, man, does she have,
like, big, giant titties?

37:32.421 --> 37:35.507
I can see this is gonna be a long
fucking night, convict.

37:46.727 --> 37:48.512
Okay, what's the deal?

37:48.612 --> 37:49.604
It's a long shot,

37:49.704 --> 37:51.972
but Billy used to work at
this club over here as a bartender.

37:52.072 --> 37:54.017
I heard him talk about it before.

37:54.117 --> 37:55.185
This neighborhood,

37:55.285 --> 37:56.971
they're gonna make me for a cop
right away.

37:57.071 --> 37:59.917
All right, you just back me up.
Pretend like you got a piece, all right?

38:00.040 --> 38:01.336
What the fuck I want to do that for?

38:01.436 --> 38:02.548
They may beat the shit out of me,

38:02.648 --> 38:04.945
but I guarantee you,
they'll cut your black ass right up.

38:05.045 --> 38:06.705
Oh, so you a bad-ass?

38:07.123 --> 38:10.125
You know, it's amazing how far
a gun and a badge will take some guys.

38:10.293 --> 38:12.953
Bullshit! Attitude and experience
is what gets you through.

38:13.053 --> 38:14.296
Come on.

38:18.175 --> 38:20.518
I'm telling you, man,
I've been in places like this before.

38:20.618 --> 38:22.468
When white cops came to fuck with me
and my friends,

38:22.568 --> 38:24.243
only thing that stopped us
from kicking their ass,

38:24.343 --> 38:25.223
they had guns and badges.

38:25.323 --> 38:27.926
Takes years of experience
to handle a joint like this.

38:28.026 --> 38:29.644
You want to bet?

38:29.812 --> 38:30.929
I got two problems.

38:31.029 --> 38:32.695
Number one,
I ain't playing fucking games.

38:32.795 --> 38:34.983
Number two,
you ain't got nothing to bet with.

38:35.318 --> 38:37.151
Look, if we go in there
and get a phone number

38:37.251 --> 38:39.404
or Ganz or a dead Indian,
anything that helps us out,

38:39.572 --> 38:41.894
turn your back for a half-hour
and let me go get some pussy.

38:41.994 --> 38:42.907
What for?

38:43.007 --> 38:46.236
Any man talks about women like you
can't get it up anyhow.

38:46.336 --> 38:47.738
I been in prison for three years.

38:47.838 --> 38:50.332
My dick gets hard if the wind blows.

38:50.833 --> 38:52.792
All right. You got a bet.

38:53.586 --> 38:56.421
But when you lose, you tell me the truth.

38:57.048 --> 38:58.498
What the fuck you talking about?

38:58.598 --> 39:00.918
Ganz didn't get out for nothing.
What's he after?

39:01.018 --> 39:02.703
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

39:02.803 --> 39:05.680
- I want to nail Ganz, just like you.
- Fuck you! Bet's off.

39:06.474 --> 39:08.350
All right, Cates, look.

39:10.519 --> 39:13.897
If I lose, I'll tell you
everything you want to know.

39:16.192 --> 39:18.810
All right, you got a deal.
Hell, I'm gonna enjoy this.

39:18.910 --> 39:20.695
I'm gonna even give you my badge.

39:21.280 --> 39:23.815
You said bullshit and experience
is all it takes, right?

39:23.915 --> 39:24.942
Right.

39:25.042 --> 39:28.070
Come on in and experience
some of my bullshit.

39:28.170 --> 39:30.705
All right. Let's see it.

40:10.079 --> 40:12.197
Not a very popular place
with the brothers.

40:12.297 --> 40:15.583
It's my kind of place.
I always liked country boys.

40:16.585 --> 40:19.087
They're sure as hell gonna like you.

40:36.272 --> 40:37.439
Howdy.

40:56.459 --> 40:58.752
- How do.
- Yeah?

40:59.295 --> 41:02.672
I'd like something to drink,
preferably some vodka.

41:03.215 --> 41:05.800
Maybe you'd best have a Black Russian.

41:09.305 --> 41:12.340
Black Russian! You hear what he said?
Black Russian.

41:12.440 --> 41:14.217
That's a funny joke. I get it.

41:14.317 --> 41:16.386
I'm black. Now, that's funny!

41:16.486 --> 41:18.346
No. I'd just rather have plain old vodka.

41:18.446 --> 41:19.806
That'd be nice.

41:19.906 --> 41:21.706
You know,
long as we're standing here talking

41:21.825 --> 41:24.936
and we're all friendly,
I'm looking for a good old boy

41:25.036 --> 41:26.313
by the name of Billy Bear.

41:26.413 --> 41:28.815
I was wondering if you might be able
to help me find him.

41:28.915 --> 41:30.150
Never heard of him.

41:30.250 --> 41:33.912
Never heard of him before.
Never heard of Billy Bear, huh?

41:36.415 --> 41:37.791
Looky here!

41:42.046 --> 41:43.580
You fucking heard of him now, man?

41:43.680 --> 41:45.587
I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

41:45.687 --> 41:48.594
Well, maybe you wouldn't mind if
I looked around for a little while then.

41:48.803 --> 41:51.846
- I don't give a shit what you do!
- Good.

42:04.985 --> 42:08.655
Never seen so many backwards-ass
country fucks in my life.

42:09.115 --> 42:13.034
It makes me sick just to be in here.
You boys look like regulars.

42:13.369 --> 42:14.812
I'm looking for a guy named Billy Bear.

42:14.912 --> 42:15.927
You know where I could find him?

42:16.027 --> 42:19.032
This is our place. I don't give a shit
what the fuck your badge says, nigger.

42:19.132 --> 42:22.127
You're a big, tough country faggot,
ain't you?

42:24.380 --> 42:28.049
You out of your fucking mind, man?
Get up against that fucking pole!

42:28.551 --> 42:30.627
Think I'm playing
a goddamn game, man?

42:30.727 --> 42:32.971
You out of your fucking mind?

42:34.515 --> 42:36.550
I'm gonna say it one more time, okay?

42:36.650 --> 42:37.801
This is a police matter,

42:37.901 --> 42:40.470
and I'm looking for
an Indian named Billy Bear.

42:40.570 --> 42:43.857
I know everybody in here
wants to cooperate with me.

42:48.112 --> 42:50.313
Hey, that's not even necessary,
all right, man?

42:50.413 --> 42:52.574
I got this situation in hand.

42:54.243 --> 42:57.787
Some of us citizens are
behind you all the way, officer.

42:59.957 --> 43:02.659
- What's your fucking problem?
- I'm on parole.

43:02.759 --> 43:04.828
- That's why you're running away?
- Yeah.

43:04.928 --> 43:07.088
Sit your country ass down, man.

43:10.176 --> 43:11.926
All right, listen up!

43:12.928 --> 43:16.097
I don't like white people!
I hate rednecks!

43:17.266 --> 43:20.977
You people are rednecks.
That means I'm enjoying this shit.

43:24.398 --> 43:26.850
You loaded here.
Where the fuck did you get this?

43:26.950 --> 43:29.186
- Tax refund.
- That's bullshit.

43:29.286 --> 43:31.988
You're too fucking stupid to have a job.

43:34.366 --> 43:37.152
You don't like that?
You don't like that shit?

43:37.252 --> 43:38.494
You hate that shit, right?

43:39.121 --> 43:42.490
- What the hell kind of cop are you?
- You know what I am?

43:42.590 --> 43:46.036
I'm your worst fucking nightmare, man.
I'm a nigger with a badge.

43:46.136 --> 43:49.589
That mean I got permission to kick
your fucking ass whenever I feel like it.

43:54.720 --> 43:56.379
All right, listen up, man.

43:56.479 --> 43:59.382
One of them's underage,
another one attacked a police officer,

43:59.482 --> 44:01.559
and I still ain't found
what I'm looking for yet.

44:02.228 --> 44:05.305
Well, look, I think you're on your way
to being out of business, all right?

44:05.405 --> 44:06.648
Let's see

44:07.441 --> 44:08.600
what we can fuck with next.

44:08.700 --> 44:12.070
Hey, man! All right! Okay! Now, listen.

44:12.655 --> 44:14.875
The Indian hangs out with a chick
who lives up the block.

44:14.975 --> 44:17.457
Just head up the alley, across
the street, where Chinatown starts,

44:17.557 --> 44:18.940
she lives on top of the jewelry store.

44:19.040 --> 44:20.647
I didn't ask you shit about his girl, man.

44:20.747 --> 44:22.239
Come on, give me a break, will you?

44:22.339 --> 44:24.902
You're gonna have to settle for
her place 'cause it's all I know.

44:25.002 --> 44:27.794
I'm telling you. I'm giving you all I know!

44:31.048 --> 44:32.507
Well, look, hoss.

44:33.050 --> 44:35.343
You start running
a respectable business,

44:35.678 --> 44:38.129
and I won't have to come in here
and hassle you every night.

44:38.229 --> 44:39.847
Know what I mean?

44:43.894 --> 44:46.388
And I want the rest of you cowboys
to know something.

44:46.488 --> 44:48.690
There's a new sheriff in town.

44:53.862 --> 44:55.363
And his name is Reggie Hammond.

44:56.031 --> 44:58.032
Y'all be cool. Right on!

45:19.722 --> 45:22.557
- Let's go, man.
- I think you got something for me.

45:23.851 --> 45:24.976
What you talking about?

45:26.729 --> 45:29.689
Why don't you give me
that gun you took off the redneck?

45:31.734 --> 45:33.735
- Oh, you saw that!
- Yeah.

45:35.070 --> 45:36.446
Here you go.

45:37.406 --> 45:40.742
While you're at it,
why don't you give me the switchblade?

45:41.201 --> 45:43.745
You saw that, too, huh?
You don't miss nothing, Jack.

45:44.413 --> 45:47.198
It was real smooth
how I took it from him, right?

45:47.298 --> 45:49.701
Listen, man,
you owe me a piece of ass, right?

45:49.801 --> 45:52.754
Why don't you just give me that gun?
We'll call it even.

45:53.589 --> 45:55.423
You did a good job, Reggie.

45:56.091 --> 45:59.385
I guess you deserve a reward. Here.

46:06.101 --> 46:07.685
Fucking bastard.

46:08.937 --> 46:10.271
That I am.

46:13.901 --> 46:16.194
Let's go get us an Indian down the alley.

46:30.626 --> 46:32.960
I don't think nobody's home, man.

46:34.463 --> 46:36.422
Let's check around back.

46:39.468 --> 46:40.468
Shit!

46:43.180 --> 46:46.466
I hope we have as much fun as we had
in that hillbilly bar back there, man.

46:46.566 --> 46:49.102
Don't bust your arm
patting yourself on the back, convict.

46:49.812 --> 46:52.514
You see the way I handled those boys?
I tell you. I'm on a roll.

46:52.614 --> 46:54.949
If we see Billy in here,
you let me take care of him, all right?

46:55.049 --> 46:57.644
Why don't you get a megaphone
and announce we're coming?

46:57.744 --> 47:01.030
You make more goddamn noise
than a busted chain saw.

47:06.578 --> 47:08.663
What the hell they watching?

47:10.666 --> 47:12.125
I don't know.

47:13.001 --> 47:15.461
- Yeah, well, TV has changed.
- Yeah.

47:17.172 --> 47:18.631
Look at this!

47:20.008 --> 47:23.511
- There. That must be Billy's girlfriend.
- Yeah. Come on.

47:27.683 --> 47:30.518
- Police! Nobody move!
- Stay where you are!

47:32.855 --> 47:35.765
Okay, you'd just better drop it,
or he's gonna get another one.

47:35.865 --> 47:37.856
Man, listen to her.
The girl thinks she's Babe Ruth.

47:37.956 --> 47:40.603
I said police!
Now put the goddamn gun down!

47:40.703 --> 47:43.656
Don't give me that police shit.
You drop it.

47:44.158 --> 47:47.034
Okay, look. Don't shoot.

47:47.578 --> 47:50.037
I'm just gonna reach for my badge.

47:55.961 --> 47:58.621
I don't like this bullshit.
I've seen fake badges before.

47:58.721 --> 48:00.895
Hey, sweetheart,
this guy got a real itchy trigger finger,

48:00.995 --> 48:01.916
and he's a nervous cop.

48:02.016 --> 48:04.145
You better listen to him,
or you'll get your brains blown out!

48:04.245 --> 48:06.846
Shut up! I'm the calm type.

48:07.556 --> 48:09.799
Now, I know you don't want me
to shoot you,

48:09.899 --> 48:11.843
and I know you don't want to shoot me.

48:11.943 --> 48:14.562
So come on, just hand me over the gun.

48:20.736 --> 48:22.645
You assholes better be real.

48:22.745 --> 48:25.482
Hey, let's just wait a minute here.
Let's see your badge.

48:25.582 --> 48:26.941
I ain't got no goddamn badge.

48:27.041 --> 48:28.890
I ought to hit you in your head
with this thing.

48:28.990 --> 48:31.446
- Hey! Will you call the cops?
- Right.

48:31.546 --> 48:33.706
Put that goddamn phone down!

48:33.832 --> 48:37.710
If you don't answer some questions,
I'm gonna haul both your asses in!

48:38.003 --> 48:39.003
Shit.

48:39.755 --> 48:41.088
All right.

48:42.799 --> 48:45.134
Which one of you sees Billy Bear?

48:45.302 --> 48:48.137
Hey, look,
it's none of your business, cop.

48:49.097 --> 48:51.674
The son of a bitch isn't here,
and he isn't coming back.

48:51.774 --> 48:54.010
You guys can do better than that.
How about you?

48:54.110 --> 48:56.590
I haven't seen him for two weeks,
and I don't think I'm gonna.

48:56.696 --> 48:58.314
He owes me money.

48:58.649 --> 49:00.775
Sounds like a real stormy romance.

49:00.943 --> 49:02.856
I don't care much
what it sounds like to you, cop.

49:02.956 --> 49:05.492
All I know is that I went a couple of laps
around the track with him,

49:05.592 --> 49:07.263
and I ended up
with the short end of the stick.

49:07.363 --> 49:09.192
- Come on.
- No, wait a minute, man.

49:09.292 --> 49:10.944
I've been in prison for three years.

49:11.044 --> 49:13.587
You know, if this lady's been getting
the short end of the stick,

49:13.687 --> 49:16.699
maybe you'd like to go a couple laps
around the track with us.

49:16.799 --> 49:18.042
Fuck off.

49:18.293 --> 49:19.544
Come on!

49:20.879 --> 49:23.957
Say, if you find Billy,
tell him to stay out of my life.

49:24.057 --> 49:26.884
I don't want any more of
his macho bullshit.

49:27.636 --> 49:28.886
Let's go.

49:35.102 --> 49:36.477
This sucks.

49:37.020 --> 49:38.596
A maniac gets a hold of my gun

49:38.696 --> 49:41.391
and runs all over the streets
killing people with it.

49:41.491 --> 49:44.394
So instead of being where I ought to be,
home in bed with my gal

49:44.494 --> 49:45.728
giving her the high hard one,

49:45.828 --> 49:49.148
I'm out here doing this shit,
roaming around the streets

49:49.248 --> 49:52.201
with an overdressed,
charcoal-colored loser like you.

49:52.327 --> 49:54.629
Look, man, if you don't like it,
why don't you just leave?

49:54.729 --> 49:56.573
I can take care of Ganz by myself,
all right?

49:56.673 --> 49:59.834
Yeah, don't make me laugh.
You can't take care of shit.

50:00.002 --> 50:03.496
You've been dicking me around
since we started this turd hunt.

50:03.596 --> 50:05.631
The only thing you're good for is games.

50:06.174 --> 50:08.626
So far, what I got out of you is nothing.

50:08.726 --> 50:10.657
Yeah, well, I'm real impressed
with you, too, man.

50:10.757 --> 50:14.507
It took a real skilled cop to kick in the
bedroom door of a couple of dykes.

50:14.607 --> 50:17.343
Luther knows more than he told me,
and so do you.

50:17.443 --> 50:19.523
Now, I want to know
what the fuck this is all about.

50:19.654 --> 50:21.723
I gave you 48 hours
to come up with something,

50:21.823 --> 50:22.932
and the clock's running.

50:23.032 --> 50:25.264
Yeah, well, maybe I don't like
the way you asked me, all right?

50:25.364 --> 50:27.320
Who gives a goddamn what you like?

50:28.155 --> 50:29.939
You're just a crook on a weekend pass.

50:30.039 --> 50:32.700
You're not even
a goddamn name anymore.

50:32.868 --> 50:34.110
You're just a spear-chucker

50:34.210 --> 50:37.163
with a number stenciled
on the back of his prison fatigues.

50:39.249 --> 50:41.876
All right, I'm through fucking around.

50:42.502 --> 50:43.544
You tell me the truth,

50:43.670 --> 50:46.497
or you're gonna get the living shit
beat out of you.

50:46.597 --> 50:49.925
Oh, you're gonna kick my ass now?
I think you've lost your mind, Cates.

50:50.052 --> 50:51.822
Why don't you put your gun
back in your holster

50:51.922 --> 50:53.171
and get in the car, and let's go?

50:53.271 --> 50:54.756
I'm serious. I'm not in the mood.

50:54.856 --> 50:56.765
And I'm just gonna end up
fucking you up out here.

50:56.865 --> 51:00.019
This is gonna be an embarrassment
to you and the police force.

51:00.437 --> 51:03.939
Let me explain one thing to you, nigger.
I fight dirty.

51:45.816 --> 51:47.483
You little fucker.

51:49.778 --> 51:52.279
You pushed me in the fucking garbage!

51:53.907 --> 51:55.658
Get the fuck off me!

52:33.321 --> 52:35.948
All right, you two, what's going on here?

52:36.450 --> 52:38.701
- Nothing.
- It's all right. I'm a cop.

52:38.827 --> 52:40.995
Yeah, sure.
Get your hands above your head!

52:42.372 --> 52:45.074
I'm too fucking tired
to put my hands above my head.

52:45.174 --> 52:47.118
My gun and badge
are over there in the car.

52:47.218 --> 52:48.961
Check it out, Bill.

52:49.296 --> 52:50.838
Get in the car!

52:56.219 --> 52:58.304
Just what the hell is going on here?

52:59.306 --> 53:01.257
We got a burglary call.

53:01.357 --> 53:04.761
Two women said a couple of hoods
broke into their place posing as cops.

53:04.861 --> 53:07.688
Yeah. I was following a lead.
We rousted them.

53:08.190 --> 53:11.309
Why don't you guys go sweet-talk 'em,
straighten it out?

53:11.409 --> 53:14.270
I got a better idea.
Why don't you do it yourself?

53:14.370 --> 53:17.156
We've got better things to do
than straighten out your messes.

53:17.866 --> 53:19.992
I'll file a report tomorrow.

53:20.118 --> 53:22.069
Yeah, well, I got to file a report tonight.

53:22.169 --> 53:24.538
Yeah? Goes with the territory.

53:35.634 --> 53:37.895
It's a good thing your friends came
when they did, Cates.

53:37.995 --> 53:41.088
- I was getting ready to get in your ass.
- Yeah? You want to try it again?

53:41.188 --> 53:45.259
- You'd just call your buddies back.
- They saved your ass, convict.

53:45.359 --> 53:47.970
That's what you'll tell them
down at the station house tonight.

53:48.070 --> 53:49.313
Yeah. Right.

53:49.439 --> 53:51.899
I'll even put it in my report that way.

53:52.067 --> 53:53.901
Yeah. I bet you will.

53:57.781 --> 54:00.241
- How much do I owe you?
- 10 bucks.

54:03.286 --> 54:04.745
Motherfucker.

54:10.043 --> 54:11.252
Hammond!

54:13.296 --> 54:17.049
You come clean, or we're going again
right here, right now.

54:17.384 --> 54:20.678
I want to know what's going on
between you and Ganz.

54:28.270 --> 54:31.389
Look, man, I've been waiting for
some money for a long time, all right?

54:31.489 --> 54:32.731
How much?

54:33.024 --> 54:34.900
Half a million dollars.

54:36.069 --> 54:37.611
You starting to get the picture now?

54:37.946 --> 54:40.330
You're on the wrong side
of the law-and-order business, Jack.

54:40.430 --> 54:42.908
Just tell me about the goddamn money.

54:45.036 --> 54:48.289
Me and some my friends hit a dealer
during a sale.

54:49.791 --> 54:52.626
It's the kind of money
nobody reports stolen.

54:52.961 --> 54:55.705
One of the guys turned around
and dropped dime on me.

54:55.805 --> 54:58.328
Happens to be the same guy
that's running around shooting people

54:58.428 --> 54:59.758
with a certain cop's gun.

55:00.427 --> 55:02.044
So he's after your money.

55:02.144 --> 55:04.597
You know, you're a real bright cop!
You know that, Jack?

55:05.181 --> 55:07.224
So how much you want, man?

55:08.435 --> 55:11.604
- You want to split 50-50?
- Not likely, convict.

55:12.397 --> 55:14.307
Oh, I can't have nothing now, right?

55:14.407 --> 55:15.808
I believe in the merit system.

55:15.908 --> 55:18.193
So far you ain't built up no points, boy.

55:18.403 --> 55:21.063
Oh, well, then, I'll be real good
from now on, Mr. Cates.

55:21.163 --> 55:23.490
Just tell me
where the goddamn money is.

55:27.537 --> 55:29.413
In the trunk of my car.

55:31.249 --> 55:32.791
Right, partner.

55:39.966 --> 55:41.626
But get this, man.

55:41.726 --> 55:44.337
We ain't brothers, we ain't partners,
and we ain't friends.

55:44.437 --> 55:47.388
Now, if Ganz gets away with my money,
you're gonna be sorry you ever met me.

55:47.488 --> 55:49.058
I'm already sorry.

56:05.075 --> 56:09.662
- All right, where's the goddamn car?
- Be cool, man. The car's parked.

56:10.080 --> 56:12.206
For three years? Bullshit!

56:12.415 --> 56:16.043
Bullshit?
I'll let you in on a little secret, Jack.

56:16.252 --> 56:18.003
You just passed it.

56:33.687 --> 56:35.229
Okay, now what?

56:35.563 --> 56:39.733
Now you get to play cop
and watch that building back there.

56:40.777 --> 56:42.728
I'm gonna get in the back seat
and go to sleep.

56:42.828 --> 56:44.230
You son of a bitch!

56:44.330 --> 56:45.890
You knew where the money was
all along.

56:45.998 --> 56:48.234
All we had to do
was come here and wait.

56:48.334 --> 56:50.987
Christ, I almost got
my ass shot off twice for nothing!

56:51.087 --> 56:53.948
Yeah, well, being a cop
is a hard job, Jack.

56:54.048 --> 56:56.784
The building opens up at 7:00.
Wake me up at a quarter to.

56:56.884 --> 56:58.494
I'll be back here asleep.

56:58.594 --> 56:59.594
Shit!

57:02.424 --> 57:03.424
Jack,

57:05.260 --> 57:06.877
tell me a story.

57:06.977 --> 57:08.262
Fuck you!

57:08.596 --> 57:10.806
Oh, that's one of my favorites.

57:12.600 --> 57:14.476
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:57.228 --> 57:59.354
I didn't want you sleeping on the job.

57:59.564 --> 58:01.599
Yo, man,
that place opens in five minutes.

58:01.699 --> 58:02.933
You better go look for Ganz.

58:03.033 --> 58:05.227
You took a big chance
leaving it here all this time.

58:05.327 --> 58:06.395
No, I didn't, man.

58:06.495 --> 58:08.099
I knew Ganz was gonna be
away for a while,

58:08.199 --> 58:11.525
and I knew Luther wouldn't cross me.
The boy ain't got no heart.

58:11.625 --> 58:14.453
Guess what?
Luther just crossed the street.

58:17.165 --> 58:19.450
That's a damned shame, man.

58:19.550 --> 58:21.297
The guy took a shot at a cop
yesterday night,

58:21.397 --> 58:23.103
and he's running around
on the street today.

58:23.379 --> 58:24.914
The judicial system ain't shit.

58:25.014 --> 58:27.382
Must've had a primo bail bondsman.

58:28.802 --> 58:31.136
Hey, buddy, I want to pick up my car.

58:31.471 --> 58:34.848
- What's the name?
- Hammond. Reggie Hammond.

58:36.017 --> 58:39.394
- This is three years old.
- Yeah. I've been busy!

58:40.396 --> 58:44.066
Hey, Al, get a load of this.
Bring down 29-012.

58:44.234 --> 58:46.102
It's been here three years.

58:46.202 --> 58:47.611
How about charging the battery?

58:47.946 --> 58:51.448
- We take care of that every month.
- Great. Just great.

58:59.290 --> 59:01.083
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

59:12.720 --> 59:14.096
There he is.

59:46.921 --> 59:49.882
Goddamn!
Look at all that dust on my car!

59:50.175 --> 59:52.459
Why the fuck don't he take it
to a car wash?

59:52.559 --> 59:55.838
I didn't know you darker people
went in for foreign jobs.

59:55.938 --> 59:57.032
Yeah, well, I had no choice.

59:57.132 --> 01:00:00.767
Some white asshole bought
the last piece-of-shit sky-blue Cadillac.

01:00:35.595 --> 01:00:37.004
Yo, man, I hope to God

01:00:37.104 --> 01:00:39.217
none of my fellas see me riding around
in this car, man.

01:00:39.317 --> 01:00:40.363
You really let this shit go bad.

01:00:40.463 --> 01:00:42.801
What you don't understand is,
I don't care how it looks.

01:00:42.901 --> 01:00:45.930
- It ain't got no class, Jack.
- Class isn't something you buy.

01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:49.266
Look at you. You got a $500 suit on,
and you're still a low-life.

01:00:49.366 --> 01:00:51.235
Yeah, but I look good.

01:01:16.344 --> 01:01:17.803
That goddamn suit is yours?

01:01:17.929 --> 01:01:19.964
Them suits was in style
a couple years back.

01:01:20.064 --> 01:01:21.056
Yeah, right.

01:01:21.156 --> 01:01:25.018
If you ever switch from armed robber
to a pimp, you're all set.

01:01:30.358 --> 01:01:32.734
- There's the money, Jack.
- Yeah, right.

01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:36.530
Look out, now!

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.201
Hold it! Hold it! Whoa! Whoa!

01:01:41.619 --> 01:01:43.245
Whoa! Whoa!

01:04:12.854 --> 01:04:15.188
Hey, you! Put that down!

01:04:24.490 --> 01:04:26.032
Luther! Luther!

01:04:34.834 --> 01:04:37.127
I'm going after the money, Jack.

01:05:04.071 --> 01:05:05.322
Come on!

01:05:06.699 --> 01:05:08.325
Stay close to me.

01:06:00.545 --> 01:06:01.745
Freeze!

01:06:01.845 --> 01:06:02.871
I'm a cop!

01:06:02.971 --> 01:06:05.090
Drop it, or you're all done!

01:06:45.715 --> 01:06:48.709
Well, look, just meet me at Vroman's
and bring the shit, okay?

01:06:48.809 --> 01:06:50.135
Thank you.

01:07:22.418 --> 01:07:25.962
Vodka with a twist!
And I'd like to run up a tab, please.

01:07:26.922 --> 01:07:28.340
Yeah, right.

01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:31.551
Hey, babe.
My name's Reggie Hammond.

01:07:31.802 --> 01:07:33.303
Well, so what?

01:07:37.933 --> 01:07:41.394
- My name's Reggie Hammond.
- I'm with somebody.

01:07:45.941 --> 01:07:48.693
How you doing?
My name's Reggie Hammond.

01:07:52.031 --> 01:07:53.239
This ain't my night.

01:08:30.736 --> 01:08:33.446
- You look awful.
- Yeah, well, so do you.

01:08:33.572 --> 01:08:35.365
It's been a long day.

01:08:35.866 --> 01:08:38.243
Long night, too, from what I heard.

01:08:38.703 --> 01:08:42.613
Word's going around that in addition
to losing Ganz for the second time,

01:08:42.714 --> 01:08:44.783
some soul brother
beat the crap out of you.

01:08:44.883 --> 01:08:46.827
Oh, bullshit. You heard the story wrong.

01:08:46.926 --> 01:08:49.705
- Doesn't look like it.
- Did anything come in yet? Any calls?

01:08:49.805 --> 01:08:51.046
Nothing.

01:08:53.466 --> 01:08:54.634
Kehoe.

01:08:55.678 --> 01:08:57.011
Ordnance.

01:09:00.265 --> 01:09:02.050
- Yeah?
- Reports are late, Cates.

01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:03.218
- Yeah.
- I need 'em.

01:09:03.318 --> 01:09:04.921
- Yeah, I'll be in tomorrow.
- 9:00 sharp.

01:09:05.022 --> 01:09:07.981
Yeah, for Christ's sake.
You can depend on it. Jesus!

01:09:10.234 --> 01:09:11.309
Bullshit.

01:09:11.408 --> 01:09:13.095
I'm heading out for a while.
How about you?

01:09:13.194 --> 01:09:14.813
No, I got to wait for a call.

01:09:14.912 --> 01:09:16.189
Okay, I'll see you in the morning.

01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:17.850
You know,
you really ought to get some rest.

01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:18.899
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.868
Hello? Yeah. He's here.

01:09:21.328 --> 01:09:23.580
Cates. For you. Line 3.

01:09:25.499 --> 01:09:27.658
Hey, motherfucker,
where the hell are you?

01:09:27.759 --> 01:09:30.086
I'm at work, asshole! Where else?

01:09:31.087 --> 01:09:32.296
Elaine.

01:09:32.548 --> 01:09:35.792
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.
I thought it was somebody else.

01:09:35.892 --> 01:09:37.093
Police business.

01:09:37.303 --> 01:09:39.511
Yeah, no wonder you're so popular.

01:09:40.723 --> 01:09:43.425
Look, I'm sorry about
the way things have been lately.

01:09:43.524 --> 01:09:45.969
I know I have not been acting real great.

01:09:46.069 --> 01:09:47.763
- Hey, Jack.
- Yeah?

01:09:47.863 --> 01:09:48.863
Jack?

01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:50.140
I almost forgot.

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.934
That pal of yours from the vice squad
wants you to call him.

01:09:53.033 --> 01:09:54.402
Jack, are you still there?

01:09:55.529 --> 01:09:57.300
He said he rousted a bar with you
last night.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.383
Well, why in the hell
didn't you tell me that before?

01:09:59.483 --> 01:10:01.526
Hey, I'm not paid
to take your personal calls.

01:10:01.626 --> 01:10:03.528
Well, what's
the goddamn number, Kehoe?

01:10:03.628 --> 01:10:05.872
It's on my desk. Find it yourself.

01:10:06.499 --> 01:10:08.536
Elaine, I got to put you on hold
for just a second.

01:10:08.636 --> 01:10:12.045
No. No, don't put me on hold!
Jack, don't put me...

01:10:13.422 --> 01:10:15.173
You son of a bitch.

01:10:18.302 --> 01:10:20.094
It's under the light.

01:10:35.152 --> 01:10:36.148
Reggie Hammond.

01:10:36.248 --> 01:10:38.480
Hammond, you son of a bitch.
Where the hell are you?

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.732
Jack! How have you been?

01:10:40.832 --> 01:10:45.411
Yeah, I've been waiting for you to call.
Yeah. I'm at Vroman's.

01:10:46.330 --> 01:10:48.289
Vroman's in the Fillmore.

01:10:48.666 --> 01:10:50.742
Yeah, I know
you don't know about this place.

01:10:50.842 --> 01:10:52.285
The brothers hang out here.

01:10:52.385 --> 01:10:54.185
They probably wouldn't let
your tight ass in.

01:10:54.338 --> 01:10:57.090
All right, I'll be right there.
Don't move your ass.

01:10:59.093 --> 01:11:00.078
- Jack.
- Yeah?

01:11:00.178 --> 01:11:02.804
- Elaine's on the other line.
- Oh, Jesus!

01:11:04.223 --> 01:11:05.974
- Elaine?
- Jack?

01:11:06.183 --> 01:11:07.433
Fuck you!

01:11:08.435 --> 01:11:09.435
Shit.

01:12:58.003 --> 01:13:01.206
- Hey, listen, my name is Reggie.
- I'm Candy.

01:13:01.306 --> 01:13:02.415
Yo, look, Candy,

01:13:02.515 --> 01:13:05.038
if I don't get some trim before
the night's over, I'm gonna bust.

01:13:05.138 --> 01:13:06.041
What?

01:13:06.141 --> 01:13:09.381
Some trim, some mugambo, some sex.

01:13:09.481 --> 01:13:12.767
Are you crazy?
You can't ask me any better than that?

01:13:14.019 --> 01:13:16.429
Look, you don't understand. It's 10:05.

01:13:16.529 --> 01:13:18.932
By 10: 10, I want to be
into some flesh, okay?

01:13:19.032 --> 01:13:21.768
Let's just go across the street over here.
Wait a second.

01:13:21.868 --> 01:13:24.187
I don't have no money.
Do you have any money on you?

01:13:24.287 --> 01:13:27.148
You mean to tell me
that you can't even pay for the room?

01:13:27.248 --> 01:13:29.985
- Hammond!
- Hey, Jack, what's happening?

01:13:30.085 --> 01:13:32.195
I want you to meet my friend Candy.
This is Jack.

01:13:32.295 --> 01:13:34.364
- Hello.
- And goodbye.

01:13:34.464 --> 01:13:36.866
Well, maybe I'll see you later.

01:13:36.966 --> 01:13:37.993
Yeah, I hope so.

01:13:38.093 --> 01:13:40.064
You know, that's some rude shit
to be pulling, man.

01:13:40.164 --> 01:13:41.496
That's the second time this week.

01:13:41.596 --> 01:13:43.999
- Where's Luther?
- Where's Ganz?

01:13:44.099 --> 01:13:45.166
We missed.

01:13:45.266 --> 01:13:47.014
No, we didn't miss nothing.
You missed, man.

01:13:47.114 --> 01:13:49.400
Luther went and took a cab
to that hotel across the street,

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:50.463
and he made a phone call.

01:13:50.563 --> 01:13:52.215
Maybe we should pay him a visit.

01:13:52.315 --> 01:13:53.592
Don't make no sense to go get him.

01:13:53.692 --> 01:13:57.012
He left an 8:00 wake-up call,
put a "do not disturb" sign on his door,

01:13:57.112 --> 01:13:58.104
and tomorrow morning,

01:13:58.204 --> 01:13:59.922
he'll go and exchange
the money for the girl.

01:14:00.022 --> 01:14:02.908
Only thing that's going to stop us
from catching Ganz is going blind, man.

01:14:03.034 --> 01:14:05.111
Why didn't you just take the money
and split?

01:14:05.487 --> 01:14:09.357
I could've did that,
but I want Ganz just as bad as you do.

01:14:09.457 --> 01:14:12.118
I'll let you in on a little secret, Jack.

01:14:12.661 --> 01:14:13.661
Ta-da!

01:14:15.622 --> 01:14:18.332
Keep it. I'm too tired to argue about that.

01:14:24.048 --> 01:14:25.798
Thanks for calling.

01:14:28.969 --> 01:14:30.470
You know, I...

01:14:33.891 --> 01:14:37.810
Well, "nigger" and "watermelon,"
I didn't mean that stuff.

01:14:38.479 --> 01:14:41.314
I was just doing my job,
keeping you down.

01:14:42.483 --> 01:14:45.943
Yeah, well, doing your job
don't explain everything, Jack.

01:14:46.153 --> 01:14:47.820
Yeah, you're right.

01:14:54.495 --> 01:14:56.905
Well, as long as you're feeling
like Abraham Lincoln...

01:14:57.005 --> 01:14:59.908
Listen, you see that girl over there
that you just made walk away?

01:15:00.008 --> 01:15:01.008
Yeah.

01:15:01.176 --> 01:15:03.184
She would love to take me to the hotel
across the street

01:15:03.284 --> 01:15:06.798
and fuck my brains out,
but I ain't got no money for a room.

01:15:08.801 --> 01:15:10.384
I got...

01:15:16.016 --> 01:15:19.977
- I got a 20. Yeah.
- This should be fine.

01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:22.806
Have fun, huh?

01:15:22.906 --> 01:15:25.483
- I'm going to have sex, Jack.
- Yeah.

01:15:29.822 --> 01:15:33.658
- You come here often, home?
- Yeah. This is my favorite place.

01:15:36.703 --> 01:15:40.698
Hey, this is my wife!
You whispering in my wife's ear?

01:15:40.798 --> 01:15:43.042
I got rent money for one night!

01:15:44.711 --> 01:15:47.088
Lack of pussy make you brave, man!

01:15:48.382 --> 01:15:49.841
Come on, let's go.

01:15:54.930 --> 01:15:56.798
Excuse me, brothers. Excuse me.

01:15:56.898 --> 01:15:58.842
So where do you want to go?

01:15:58.942 --> 01:16:01.636
We can go right across the street
to the hotel if you want.

01:16:01.736 --> 01:16:03.062
All right.

01:16:07.067 --> 01:16:09.185
Oh, shit. Come on.

01:16:09.285 --> 01:16:11.404
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

01:16:14.992 --> 01:16:16.722
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Hey, wait a minute.

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:17.743
I'm sorry.

01:16:17.843 --> 01:16:20.496
- That was quick.
- Luther's on the move, man.

01:16:53.906 --> 01:16:55.448
Open your coat.

01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:57.825
Both sides.

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.788
- Let her go.
- Money first.

01:17:03.624 --> 01:17:05.124
Just show me!

01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:10.046
Set it there.

01:17:11.048 --> 01:17:13.708
- Rosalie, are you okay?
- Luther!

01:17:13.808 --> 01:17:15.718
What are you talking about, huh?

01:17:16.637 --> 01:17:18.471
I said I wouldn't hurt her, didn't I?

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:29.367
A bus! You goddamn whiskey mick cop!

01:18:29.467 --> 01:18:33.538
You lost a stolen bus!
I got five deaths related to Ganz!

01:18:33.638 --> 01:18:36.465
And you blow it for
a lousy nigger convict!

01:18:37.884 --> 01:18:40.720
That's right! I called him a nigger!
You bet I did!

01:18:41.471 --> 01:18:42.547
Come on.

01:18:42.647 --> 01:18:44.659
Now, I saw the report
on that little piece of shit.

01:18:44.759 --> 01:18:48.136
If he's spent one legal day in his life,
it'll be a record!

01:18:48.236 --> 01:18:49.554
And this is it for you!

01:18:49.654 --> 01:18:52.398
Suspension, review board!
You've had it!

01:18:52.566 --> 01:18:55.606
As soon as it get round you protected
a con rather than nail a cop killer...

01:18:55.743 --> 01:18:57.737
Wait a minute, god damn it!

01:18:58.864 --> 01:19:00.532
I'm gonna tell you
something about this man.

01:19:00.632 --> 01:19:02.908
He's got more brains
than you'll ever know!

01:19:04.077 --> 01:19:06.787
He's got more guts
than any partner I ever had!

01:19:07.331 --> 01:19:11.334
Just 'cause you say it with conviction,
it don't mean shit to me!

01:19:11.543 --> 01:19:13.419
Let's get out of here.

01:19:16.506 --> 01:19:18.966
And where the Christ
do you think you're going?

01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:22.670
Don't you think
you're being kind of hard on the guy?

01:19:22.770 --> 01:19:25.056
You go fuck yourself, convict!

01:19:45.327 --> 01:19:48.329
- How'd my car get here?
- I had it impounded.

01:19:49.873 --> 01:19:52.283
We'll use it to take you
back to the slam.

01:19:52.383 --> 01:19:54.952
Now, wait a minute.
Ganz got away with all my money,

01:19:55.052 --> 01:19:57.955
and you're going to take me back to jail
in my own car?

01:19:58.055 --> 01:20:00.208
Somehow this shit just don't seem right.

01:20:00.308 --> 01:20:02.968
Yeah, a lot of things don't seem right.

01:20:04.805 --> 01:20:06.636
I don't know about you,
but I could use a drink.

01:20:06.736 --> 01:20:09.266
I'll buy. It'll be my goodbye present.

01:20:10.644 --> 01:20:12.644
I feel real bad, Jack.
I feel like I let you down.

01:20:12.778 --> 01:20:16.148
No, you didn't let me down.
Hell, it was a long shot.

01:20:16.817 --> 01:20:19.360
We gave him a hell of a run, though.

01:20:19.903 --> 01:20:22.113
But we didn't catch him, man.

01:20:57.732 --> 01:20:59.976
- Hello?
- Yeah, let me talk to Kehoe.

01:21:00.076 --> 01:21:01.569
Yeah. Hold on.

01:21:07.367 --> 01:21:10.453
Kehoe, answer the damn phone.
It's for you.

01:21:10.912 --> 01:21:12.163
Hold on.

01:21:12.539 --> 01:21:14.790
- Yeah?
- Kehoe, how's it going?

01:21:15.417 --> 01:21:16.625
Not so good.

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:20.337
- What about the other guys?
- They're all on the street.

01:21:20.714 --> 01:21:23.249
- How about the airport?
- It's clean.

01:21:23.349 --> 01:21:25.801
- Train station?
- Same deal.

01:21:26.803 --> 01:21:29.138
They dumped the bus in Chinatown.

01:21:30.015 --> 01:21:32.308
Other than that, we got nothing.

01:21:32.726 --> 01:21:35.436
All right. I'll get back to you later on.

01:21:42.235 --> 01:21:44.570
Nothing. No Ganz, no Indian.

01:21:45.071 --> 01:21:48.107
Airport's clean, bus station,
train stations, docks...

01:21:48.207 --> 01:21:49.207
Shit.

01:21:50.702 --> 01:21:52.119
That's too bad, Jack.

01:21:52.245 --> 01:21:55.281
Looks like the partnership ended
before it got a chance to start, huh?

01:21:55.381 --> 01:21:57.458
Yeah, some partnership, huh?

01:21:59.252 --> 01:22:03.255
- What's up with your lady?
- Hell, we had another fight. Why?

01:22:04.424 --> 01:22:06.604
If I was depressed and had a lady,
I'd go see her, man.

01:22:06.704 --> 01:22:07.676
It'd make me feel better.

01:22:07.776 --> 01:22:09.553
I figure you wanted
to do the same thing.

01:22:09.930 --> 01:22:12.806
Nah. I'll make it up to her tomorrow.

01:22:15.268 --> 01:22:17.386
You think that big Indian
will go down to Chinatown

01:22:17.486 --> 01:22:19.375
- and try to patch it up with his girl?
- No, man.

01:22:19.475 --> 01:22:20.639
Billy's girl don't want to see him.

01:22:20.739 --> 01:22:21.991
I don't think he'll be going back there.

01:22:22.091 --> 01:22:24.151
Well, they got the bus
down in Chinatown.

01:22:24.277 --> 01:22:26.068
Jack, you're reaching for shit now,
all right?

01:22:26.168 --> 01:22:27.376
Yeah, but you're the one that said

01:22:27.476 --> 01:22:29.484
when you're on the run,
you go back and visit your girl.

01:22:29.584 --> 01:22:32.193
Yeah, but Billy's girl don't have
no interest in his crotch, Jack.

01:22:32.293 --> 01:22:33.999
She want to put some bullets
in his behind.

01:22:34.099 --> 01:22:36.030
Yeah, I am reaching. What the hell.

01:22:36.130 --> 01:22:39.708
You got important things to do,
like going back to jail.

01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:44.630
- Chinatown, huh?
- Yeah.

01:23:03.692 --> 01:23:05.442
There she is, Jack.

01:23:11.491 --> 01:23:14.660
Whatever play I make,
you just back me up.

01:23:15.829 --> 01:23:17.079
Come on.

01:23:28.258 --> 01:23:30.376
- I hear you got visitors.
- Would you guys...

01:23:30.476 --> 01:23:32.420
Shut up. Don't give me any crap.

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:35.715
Answer my questions
or I'll tear your fucking lungs out.

01:23:35.815 --> 01:23:39.343
You're Billy's girl, aren't you?
You've always been his girl.

01:23:39.443 --> 01:23:42.263
Listen, the man can live or die.
It's up to you.

01:23:42.363 --> 01:23:44.682
Let us in
and he has a chance to make it.

01:23:44.782 --> 01:23:46.817
Otherwise, he's a dead man.

01:23:52.824 --> 01:23:54.325
He's in the first room down the hall.

01:23:54.659 --> 01:23:56.118
Where's Ganz?

01:23:57.203 --> 01:23:59.530
He's in the back,
down the other corridor.

01:23:59.630 --> 01:24:01.290
All right. Come on.

01:24:47.253 --> 01:24:49.755
Give it up, Billy. You got no chance.

01:24:59.224 --> 01:25:01.308
Billy, you're going to lose.

01:25:12.779 --> 01:25:14.029
Get down!

01:25:16.866 --> 01:25:18.117
Come on!

01:25:21.287 --> 01:25:24.039
Help me! Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:25:30.755 --> 01:25:32.256
It's all over.

01:25:37.262 --> 01:25:38.887
Oh, God damn you!

01:28:03.449 --> 01:28:04.942
You ought to know, Reggie,

01:28:05.042 --> 01:28:08.120
if you come up against me,
you're going to lose.

01:28:09.622 --> 01:28:10.698
Now, come on.

01:28:10.798 --> 01:28:13.458
There's one more little thing
I got to take care of.

01:28:18.965 --> 01:28:21.300
Hey, cop! Come on!

01:28:21.843 --> 01:28:23.760
I got something for you!

01:28:35.899 --> 01:28:37.983
You're not going to make it.

01:28:38.735 --> 01:28:41.896
What are you talking about?
I got your gun.

01:28:41.996 --> 01:28:44.823
I got the money. I got everything.

01:28:47.118 --> 01:28:49.570
Take aim, man,
and blow his fucking brains out!

01:28:49.670 --> 01:28:51.572
Bullshit! He ain't gonna try it.

01:28:51.672 --> 01:28:53.040
Right, cop?

01:28:56.628 --> 01:28:59.338
Are you crazy, man? I was just bluffing!

01:29:03.217 --> 01:29:04.551
I got hit.

01:29:06.387 --> 01:29:08.972
I don't believe it. I got shot!

01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:12.601
You're done. End of story.

01:29:12.852 --> 01:29:14.019
You...

01:29:47.637 --> 01:29:49.680
- I got to go, okay?
- Okay.

01:29:53.559 --> 01:29:56.645
Look, here's a little something for you.

01:29:57.105 --> 01:29:58.639
I told you I wasn't a pro.

01:29:58.739 --> 01:30:00.516
Take that and buy yourself
something nice.

01:30:00.616 --> 01:30:05.153
I'd do it, but I'm in a rush, okay?
I got a cop waiting for me downstairs.

01:30:08.783 --> 01:30:10.909
I'll be back in about six months.

01:30:11.119 --> 01:30:13.821
We'll get together and go out
and have a good time, all right?

01:30:13.921 --> 01:30:16.081
We'll go dancing or something.

01:30:16.666 --> 01:30:19.126
Okay. You take care of yourself.

01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:20.919
You, too.

01:30:21.170 --> 01:30:22.166
Bye.

01:30:22.266 --> 01:30:23.964
I'll see you later.

01:30:39.272 --> 01:30:40.389
All right. Bust my chops.

01:30:40.489 --> 01:30:43.183
Tell me how great you were
with that chick in there.

01:30:43.283 --> 01:30:46.403
I'm not going in for
all that macho shit, Jack.

01:30:46.779 --> 01:30:48.071
I was great.

01:30:48.489 --> 01:30:50.699
I should have my dick bronzed.

01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:58.165
This what you want to talk about?

01:31:00.376 --> 01:31:01.816
Hey, come on, Jack. That's not fair.

01:31:01.919 --> 01:31:03.996
I've been waiting for that money
for three years.

01:31:04.096 --> 01:31:05.699
What happened to
all that merit system shit

01:31:05.799 --> 01:31:06.798
you was talking about?

01:31:07.675 --> 01:31:08.792
It's your money.

01:31:08.892 --> 01:31:11.261
It'll be there in six months
when you get out.

01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:19.061
And you don't want any of it?

01:31:19.645 --> 01:31:21.104
Not my style.

01:31:24.567 --> 01:31:25.726
I need a car.

01:31:25.826 --> 01:31:28.570
How about loaning me
a couple thousand when you get out?

01:31:29.989 --> 01:31:31.656
What kind of car you want?

01:31:32.075 --> 01:31:33.492
Convertible.

01:31:33.659 --> 01:31:35.327
I'm a rag top man.

01:31:39.082 --> 01:31:40.707
- Deal.
- Good.

01:31:48.424 --> 01:31:50.584
But even if you do give me
the money for a car,

01:31:50.684 --> 01:31:51.927
it don't mean shit.

01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:56.181
If I ever hear of you crossing the line,
I'll bust your ass.

01:32:01.771 --> 01:32:05.023
Now, Jack, the both of us know

01:32:05.858 --> 01:32:08.560
that I'm gonna be an honest man
from now on, right?

01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:09.660
Good.

01:32:12.698 --> 01:32:15.075
But if I did decide to be a thief,

01:32:15.868 --> 01:32:18.495
what makes you think
you can catch me?

01:32:21.207 --> 01:32:23.667
Can I have my lighter back, Reggie?

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:30.670
