00:04.539 --> 00:07.588
My girlfriend won't look at me.
I could cry every minute.

00:07.623 --> 00:10.242
We did it before. Can we do it now?

00:10.277 --> 00:11.535
I don't think so.

00:12.070 --> 00:13.659
You put a kid in hospital.

00:13.693 --> 00:16.504
I couldn't stand the way she
was fucking looking at him.

00:16.539 --> 00:17.511
I love him, Cook.

00:18.531 --> 00:21.853
Sentence set for two weeks
from today. Take him down.

- Ready?
- Teeth?

01:25.723 --> 01:26.715
All clear.

01:26.750 --> 01:28.475
Right, let's get to work then.

01:33.787 --> 01:36.938
Please, Dad, I'm too young to die.

01:36.973 --> 01:38.056
Shut up, kid.

01:38.091 --> 01:39.934
I'm your son, your only son.

01:39.969 --> 01:40.958
Saml

01:43.200 --> 01:44.121
Hiya, love.

01:46.454 --> 01:48.706
Dare I ask what you're doing now?

01:48.814 --> 01:51.363
Are you leading a busy lifestyle?

01:51.398 --> 01:53.912
Not enough time for a full work-out?

01:54.032 --> 01:56.853
Don't worry, cos Fitch Fitness
has got the answer.

01:56.888 --> 01:57.969
Yeah!

01:58.004 --> 02:02.805
The new concept in fitness that
gives you a full body work-out in just...

02:02.840 --> 02:04.077
Five minutes!

02:04.112 --> 02:06.433
The HyperFitch Machine!
Don't get Fitch...

02:06.468 --> 02:08.699
Get HyperFitch!

02:09.731 --> 02:11.440
That's great, Rob!

02:11.475 --> 02:13.921
Any chance you could invent
a moneymaking machine

02:13.956 --> 02:14.952
while you're at it?

02:14.987 --> 02:16.261
You're looking at it, love.

02:16.402 --> 02:18.256
Are you girls off to work?

02:18.401 --> 02:20.119
Someone has to.

02:22.522 --> 02:23.921
See you in a bit, yeah?

02:25.066 --> 02:26.272
Laters, lover.

02:29.187 --> 02:30.506
Er, Rob?

02:30.640 --> 02:31.742
Yeah?

02:31.777 --> 02:33.369
Where's that bolt go?

02:33.505 --> 02:35.509
What? Oh, shit!

02:35.544 --> 02:37.513
- Agh!
- James!

02:45.377 --> 02:47.413
Things are cool, aren't they, Mum?

02:48.411 --> 02:49.833
Between you and Dad?

02:50.924 --> 02:54.485
Of course, Katiekins!
Nothing for you to worry about.

03:04.888 --> 03:07.250
How unreal do I look?

03:07.285 --> 03:09.573
Amazingly unreal.

03:09.608 --> 03:12.532
Dean is going to come in his pants
when he sees me.

03:13.745 --> 03:16.225
Brandy!

03:16.260 --> 03:17.445
Baby!

03:17.480 --> 03:19.666
You look unreal.

03:19.701 --> 03:22.704
I'm sorry I'm late.
My colonic overran.

03:24.742 --> 03:27.582
Jenna, have you talked to OK!
About covering the wedding?

03:27.617 --> 03:31.394
Unfortunately, Vivienne, they insisted
they only cover premiership do's.

03:33.147 --> 03:34.822
Excuse me?

03:34.857 --> 03:37.508
I mean, negotiations are still
ongoing.

03:38.651 --> 03:40.221
Wonderful.

03:40.256 --> 03:41.602
Now,

03:41.637 --> 03:48.258
we also want a gaggle of swans,
100 doves and a trained owl.

03:48.293 --> 03:49.253
An owl?

03:49.288 --> 03:51.555
To bear the ring.

03:51.590 --> 03:53.826
These will be expensive extras.

03:53.861 --> 03:56.841
Jenna, I promised Brandy
the wedding of her dreams...

03:58.408 --> 04:00.279
...and that is what she'll have.

04:00.314 --> 04:02.484
I'm sure you'd want the same for
Katie.

04:02.519 --> 04:07.274
Look, I'll sort out the hen night and
you just deal with the owls and stuff, OK?

04:07.309 --> 04:10.235
Daughters, eh?
What would we do without them?

04:10.270 --> 04:11.258
Don't know!

04:13.342 --> 04:16.891
See you tonight, and don't forget
the theme, sluts and studs.

04:16.926 --> 04:18.319
Sluts and studs.

04:22.701 --> 04:24.601
Well, come on then.

04:30.576 --> 04:31.659
That's you.

04:31.694 --> 04:36.973
Now, Katherine, your home tests were
coming up correct, you're not pregnant.

04:39.321 --> 04:40.710
Thank God!

04:40.745 --> 04:42.713
What's up with my periods then?

04:43.773 --> 04:47.197
Your results show that you're going
through something called...

04:47.232 --> 04:48.988
...a premature menopause.

04:49.023 --> 04:50.632
Oh, right.

04:52.627 --> 04:53.958
Shit!

04:57.504 --> 04:59.517
I can't imagine what you're feeling.

04:59.552 --> 05:03.830
Not being able to have children...
Well, it isn't a nice thought, is it?

05:03.865 --> 05:05.436
Especially at your age.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.008
What are you talking about?

05:08.856 --> 05:12.360
Katherine, the menopause
prevents you from ovulating.

05:15.189 --> 05:18.625
Which means you won't
be able to conceive babies.

05:18.660 --> 05:20.880
What? Ever?

05:22.657 --> 05:24.921
But there's pills for that, right?

05:25.961 --> 05:27.269
I'm afraid not.

05:29.065 --> 05:31.448
I know this is a lot to take in.

05:31.483 --> 05:33.832
Would you like me to call your mum?

05:41.781 --> 05:43.066
Well?

05:44.499 --> 05:46.137
Have I got you knocked up?

05:47.259 --> 05:50.148
Thank fuck! That would totally
not be awesome.

05:56.786 --> 05:59.149
You can pretty much fuck off now.

05:59.184 --> 06:01.513
What's with the mood, sugar titties?

06:01.548 --> 06:02.506
Leave me alone.

06:02.541 --> 06:04.093
Kitty Kat, stop kidding round.

06:04.128 --> 06:06.596
Do I look like I'm kidding?
You're dumped.

06:06.631 --> 06:07.943
Fuck off.

06:19.469 --> 06:21.517
Broke my fucking toe.

06:21.552 --> 06:24.521
Goodbye, Sam.

06:26.197 --> 06:27.208
Katie!

06:42.501 --> 06:46.403
Hi, this is Emily. Can't come to the phone
right now but leave me a message.

06:46.438 --> 06:48.429
Bitch!

06:56.903 --> 06:59.428
You're in the wrong account.

07:01.024 --> 07:03.070
- No, sweetheart, I can assure you...
- Mum.

07:03.105 --> 07:05.310
"The Fitch Fitness account
has been empty... '

07:05.345 --> 07:07.476
This has nothing to do
with Fitch Fitness.

07:07.511 --> 07:11.706
I use our family account
and we are not bankrupt.

07:11.741 --> 07:14.357
'I'm sorry about this,
give me a moment to look into it.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.794
'Do you know your password? '

07:15.829 --> 07:18.787
Look, you know,
I don't have time for this.

07:18.822 --> 07:22.125
I'm trying to run a business here.

07:22.160 --> 07:26.256
So why don't you just get it on
your stupid screen and sort it out?

07:26.291 --> 07:29.108
'It says here you've been informed
on numerous occasions.

07:29.143 --> 07:32.215
- 'Have you had any letters? '
- No, we haven't received notification.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.530
No nothing, zilch.

07:33.565 --> 07:36.830
'Mrs. Fitch, you are not eligible
for any more loans

07:36.865 --> 07:39.601
'and you've exceeded
your overdraft limit.'

07:39.636 --> 07:41.008
Arsehole!

07:41.885 --> 07:45.753
- 'Are you referring to me? '
- No, not you.

07:45.788 --> 07:47.555
'Hello? '

07:47.590 --> 07:49.051
Mum?

07:49.086 --> 07:50.428
What are those?

07:53.665 --> 07:55.223
Deep breaths, Jenna.

07:55.258 --> 07:56.637
Deep breaths.

07:56.672 --> 07:57.735
Mum?

07:57.770 --> 07:59.715
Honey, we're home!

07:59.750 --> 08:01.134
Mum?

08:01.169 --> 08:02.474
Mum?

08:02.509 --> 08:03.533
Babe, we're back.

08:03.568 --> 08:04.847
Mum!

08:04.882 --> 08:08.079
The nurse said that I have an unusual
fascination for the female anatomy

08:08.114 --> 08:11.606
and that I should consider
a career as a gyna...

08:11.641 --> 08:14.421
Gyna...

08:14.456 --> 08:17.202
Gyna...

08:18.243 --> 08:19.892
What's the word, Dad?

08:19.927 --> 08:22.278
Gynaecologist.

08:22.313 --> 08:25.487
Something you want to tell me, Rob?

08:29.478 --> 08:32.174
Don't you dare run away from me,
don't you dare!

08:32.208 --> 08:35.472
You stupid, stupid person.

08:35.506 --> 08:40.808
- You bastard, you're a fucking
coward. - I was going to tell you.

08:40.844 --> 08:43.566
- You're a fucking coward.
- It's not my fault.

08:43.601 --> 08:46.288
We are so finished.
Consider yourself divorced.

08:47.523 --> 08:51.596
You arsehole! You ruined everything!
You fucking bastard! Stupid, stupid...

08:51.631 --> 08:52.786
What's happening?

08:53.889 --> 08:55.460
You'll be all right.

08:56.495 --> 08:58.168
Everything's going to be fine.

09:49.821 --> 09:52.813
Don't you dare make out
like I'm the one in the wrong.

09:52.848 --> 09:55.363
Just calm down, love.

09:55.398 --> 09:58.629
I'm gonna burn your
"Gym of the Year" certificate.

09:58.664 --> 10:00.517
- What?
- What's going on, Mum?

10:03.314 --> 10:04.922
Is Dad coming back?

10:04.957 --> 10:07.401
We'll talk about it later.

10:07.436 --> 10:11.839
You need to concentrate on doing
a good job for me tonight, OK?

10:13.845 --> 10:17.144
We've got a lot riding on
this wedding now, sweetheart.

10:17.179 --> 10:19.166
Let me look at you.

10:22.799 --> 10:23.852
Perfection.

10:29.477 --> 10:32.422
Katie! This is Candace, my BFFE.

10:32.457 --> 10:35.369
Nice outfit!
Sorry about the change of theme.

10:35.404 --> 10:36.971
Candy surprised us all with these.

10:37.006 --> 10:41.204
Soz, hun. I was going to get you one
but I didn't know what to put on the back.

10:41.239 --> 10:44.133
Another shot, Brands?
WTF, Cands.

10:44.168 --> 10:48.480
Here we go, a toast to my new
boyfriend, Danny Guillermo.

10:48.515 --> 10:51.584
To husbands, handbags and holidays!

10:56.005 --> 10:58.109
Danny's told me about you.

10:58.144 --> 11:01.762
I figured you'd have bigger tits.
They're like Danny's favourite thing ever.

11:01.797 --> 11:04.302
- He never complained.
- Not to your face.

11:04.337 --> 11:06.689
So, you got a new man now then?

11:06.724 --> 11:10.421
Brandy, Baby, I am paying Katie
to work, not to socialise.

11:10.456 --> 11:11.812
Sorry, Mum.

11:12.852 --> 11:16.367
Our table is finally ready, girls.

11:18.225 --> 11:21.895
My darling daughter has been blessed
with her looks

11:21.930 --> 11:25.565
and what God didn't give her,
my plastic surgeon did!

11:29.648 --> 11:33.641
Brandy, sweetheart, beautiful...

11:33.676 --> 11:36.166
I am so proud of you.

11:36.201 --> 11:40.174
You've grown up to be
a sexy, arousing woman.

11:40.209 --> 11:44.320
And what with the wedding,
and now the baby,

11:44.355 --> 11:48.432
you've just exceeded all my
expectations.

11:48.467 --> 11:49.414
What baby?

11:49.449 --> 11:51.981
Mummy, it's a secret.

11:52.016 --> 11:55.099
It's better for people to know,
than think you're a fatty.

11:55.134 --> 11:58.382
Girlies, will you please raise
your glasses

11:58.417 --> 12:03.366
and toast my angel,
daughter and grandchild bearer!

12:03.401 --> 12:05.526
To Brandylicious!

12:05.561 --> 12:07.616
Brandylicious!

12:07.651 --> 12:09.978
Now, let's all get completely
wrecked,

12:10.013 --> 12:13.210
give them paps
something to print tomorrow!

13:12.807 --> 13:14.828
Hiya, Babes.

13:14.863 --> 13:17.259
You having a rave?
Rave and a half.

13:17.294 --> 13:20.138
I'm so angry Mummy told everyone
I got knocked up.

13:20.173 --> 13:21.878
Yeah, I bet.

13:21.913 --> 13:23.714
Oh, I'll have some of that.

13:23.749 --> 13:26.994
You do know you're not supposed
to drink when you're pregnant?

13:27.029 --> 13:30.240
Don't care, and I don't think
you can talk to me like that.

13:30.275 --> 13:32.432
I'll do what I want.

13:34.268 --> 13:35.735
You're in my way. Move.

13:40.858 --> 13:42.473
Katie!

13:46.988 --> 13:48.876
What are you doing here?

13:50.685 --> 13:52.211
You cool?

13:52.246 --> 13:53.895
Have a drink with us.

13:53.930 --> 13:56.042
Is that a joke?

13:56.077 --> 13:57.607
Katie, I'm...
You haven't changed.

13:57.642 --> 13:59.138
I can see straight through you.

13:59.173 --> 14:00.565
Likewise.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.409
Never going to let that smile
falter?

14:02.444 --> 14:03.947
Only when yours does.

14:03.982 --> 14:06.260
Sweetheart, I've run out of fags.

14:06.295 --> 14:09.025
You'll need to run along
and go and get some more.

14:10.124 --> 14:12.877
One, I'm not your fucking maid.

14:12.912 --> 14:17.781
Two, I don't work for you, so you'll have
to go and get your own fags, sweetheart.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.022
Stupid bitch.

14:19.057 --> 14:20.149
Rudeness!

14:21.433 --> 14:23.731
Swallow or spit, girlfriend?

14:32.192 --> 14:33.989
How dare she?
Who does she think she is?

14:41.374 --> 14:43.524
Who the fuck do you think you are?

14:46.675 --> 14:49.701
I'm Katie fucking Fitch.
Who the fuck are you?

14:49.736 --> 14:52.728
Come on, princess,
that's enough for one night.

14:52.763 --> 14:53.844
Get off me!

14:57.611 --> 15:00.239
Look at yourself.
You are disgusting.

15:00.274 --> 15:02.237
You are an embarrassment.

15:02.272 --> 15:03.473
Sack her, Mummy.

15:03.508 --> 15:06.318
You and your useless mother
are fired. Get rid of her.

15:06.353 --> 15:08.647
Come on, sweet cheeks,
don't mess with them.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.949
I don't smoke.

15:49.984 --> 15:51.383
What you scared of?

15:51.418 --> 15:53.120
Uh, cancer?

15:59.398 --> 16:00.581
Fuck it.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.386
Steady.

16:07.502 --> 16:09.288
You didn't inhale properly.

16:09.323 --> 16:10.787
Breathe in.

16:10.822 --> 16:13.905
Now breathe in again so it goes
there.

16:21.825 --> 16:23.634
Why are you being nice to me?

16:24.767 --> 16:26.166
Life's too short.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.569
You are such a fucking cliche.

16:34.847 --> 16:36.257
So what's it like?

16:37.277 --> 16:38.824
What's what like?

16:39.846 --> 16:41.040
Love.

16:43.033 --> 16:44.321
Great.

16:44.356 --> 16:45.919
It's really lovely.

16:45.954 --> 16:47.751
That sounded convincing.

16:48.827 --> 16:50.408
It's fine.

16:52.286 --> 16:55.141
Nothing's ever perfect, you know?

16:55.176 --> 16:57.247
I thought it could be.

16:57.282 --> 17:01.378
I wanted the perfect boyfriend,
perfect marriage, perfect everything.

17:03.178 --> 17:04.896
What's changed?

17:06.516 --> 17:07.994
Me.

17:15.678 --> 17:17.529
I don't know who I am any more.

17:17.564 --> 17:21.227
I thought you were
Katie fucking Fitch!

17:58.080 --> 18:00.401
I used to hide in the bath
when she was angry.

18:03.070 --> 18:05.079
I've really messed up, kiddo.

18:05.114 --> 18:08.311
Yeah, but you love each other, right?

18:08.346 --> 18:10.583
For richer, for poorer.

18:38.514 --> 18:39.576
Kids...

18:39.611 --> 18:43.160
it seems that your father
has let us down once again.

18:43.195 --> 18:44.226
Jen, please.

18:44.261 --> 18:46.605
He's been selfish and stupid.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.500
- Mum, stop it! - I suggest
you keep shtoom, young lady,

18:49.535 --> 18:52.361
considering you've lost us
the only income we had.

18:54.784 --> 18:58.800
Because of his stupidity, this
house...

18:59.920 --> 19:03.515
our home, is being taken from us.

19:03.550 --> 19:04.651
Today.

19:04.686 --> 19:06.881
Tell your children what that means,
Rob.

19:12.737 --> 19:14.133
It means we're homeless.

19:14.168 --> 19:18.252
That's right, it means we're
homeless because of your dad.

19:18.287 --> 19:19.995
I tried to save the gym.

19:20.030 --> 19:22.795
It's these loan companies,
nice as pie one minute,

19:22.830 --> 19:25.833
next thing they're calling you up,
sending you letters,

19:25.868 --> 19:27.270
but you gotta believe me,

19:27.305 --> 19:29.791
we're going to make a fortune
out of that machine.

19:29.826 --> 19:33.068
That machine's a total waste of
space, Rob, just like you.

19:35.907 --> 19:37.661
Take James upstairs.

19:37.696 --> 19:40.802
But Mum...
Katie, for once, do as you're told.

19:54.885 --> 19:57.615
How could you do this to us?
To your own children?

19:57.650 --> 20:00.185
- Your own children?
- I'm trying to do the best I can.

20:00.220 --> 20:02.178
Have you got any
sense of responsibility?

20:02.213 --> 20:04.372
- Have you heard of communication?
- I'm doing the best I can.

20:04.407 --> 20:06.750
- Have you got any sense of responsibility?
- You're just like a child!

20:10.652 --> 20:12.646
Hello?

20:12.681 --> 20:14.640
Come on, folks.

20:18.771 --> 20:20.377
Yes?

20:20.412 --> 20:24.018
Good morning, sweetheart. We're
here to repossess your belongings.

20:30.049 --> 20:31.652
Love, open up, would ya?

20:34.788 --> 20:36.699
Come on, folks!
Don't fuck us about!

20:36.734 --> 20:39.163
Open up, open the door.

20:39.198 --> 20:41.091
Get your stuff.

20:45.732 --> 20:46.960
Morning, Mr. Fitch.

20:49.797 --> 20:52.288
Hey, lads, you're going to be
reasonable, yeah?

20:52.323 --> 20:54.058
Certainly, ain't we?

20:54.093 --> 20:56.470
Reasonable's our middle name.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.879
Good, ta.

20:58.914 --> 21:02.759
Can you just read out your court order,
just so I know you're not, you know...

21:02.794 --> 21:04.391
Cunts.

21:04.426 --> 21:05.988
Righty-oh.

21:10.028 --> 21:16.137
"By the order of the county court,
given this day, 17th of February 2010,

21:16.172 --> 21:22.040
"it is hereby given down that
goods to the value of Â£13,337...

21:25.421 --> 21:29.369
"...William M Janus and granted
licence to reposse..."

21:29.404 --> 21:32.170
Are you still there, Mr. Fitch?
Hello?

21:32.205 --> 21:33.959
Something's not right here.

21:35.998 --> 21:40.071
All right, my lover? You going
to open up? I got sweeties.

21:40.106 --> 21:41.347
Paedo!

21:42.532 --> 21:44.066
- Move!
- Garage!

21:44.101 --> 21:45.204
Go!

21:45.239 --> 21:49.152
Come on, open up, you lot. Come on,
this is getting stupid now.

21:49.187 --> 21:51.111
Right, fuck this, we're going in.

21:57.433 --> 21:58.832
Hello?

22:02.721 --> 22:06.111
Tell you what...
I think it's happened again.

22:06.146 --> 22:07.362
Oh, bugger!

22:08.753 --> 22:10.295
Oh, well.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.787
Fuck it, can't think of everything.

22:12.822 --> 22:16.087
Oh look! They've got one
of them there glass swans.

22:16.122 --> 22:17.148
Where to?

22:17.183 --> 22:19.434
My mum used to have one of those.
Oh, yeah!

22:19.469 --> 22:24.577
This is a beauty. It's really heavy.
Perfectly sculptured. Look at this, bud.

22:24.612 --> 22:28.523
You see, it's the weight of the lead
that they put in the crystal, see?

22:28.558 --> 22:30.692
Oh, feel the quality of him.

22:33.481 --> 22:36.507
Oh, yeah, I see where
you're coming from, Kev.

22:37.862 --> 22:39.807
Might take this home for my Carol.

22:39.808 --> 22:41.981
I promised Phil some new saucepans.

22:42.016 --> 22:43.363
And a toaster.

22:43.398 --> 22:45.953
You get a better quality of
toaster up at this estate.

22:45.988 --> 22:49.139
Well, you know what they're like round
here, all fur coat and no knickers.

22:50.687 --> 22:52.130
Nouveau reech, in't it?

22:53.216 --> 22:56.208
Mind you, I wouldn't have done it
out like this, would you?

22:56.243 --> 22:57.554
I don't like that paint job at all.

22:57.589 --> 22:59.109
Magnolia and lime? Bollocks!

22:59.172 --> 23:01.936
Time? All that time when those
fucking bills were coming in

23:01.971 --> 23:03.288
and you did nothing about it!

23:03.323 --> 23:06.167
How long was that?
Cos when I looked at them

23:06.202 --> 23:08.860
I'd say there was a good six,
seven months' worth!

23:08.895 --> 23:12.296
It takes time to sort out -
you wouldn't let me deal with it!

23:15.168 --> 23:18.558
I know you're not
the sharpest tool in the box...

23:18.593 --> 23:21.948
We're not going to sort it out here.
Get in the car!

23:21.983 --> 23:23.587
I hate KFC.

23:24.122 --> 23:25.507
What?

23:25.542 --> 23:27.658
Elliot Evans's parents got divorced

23:27.693 --> 23:29.732
and his dad spent
every night in KFC.

23:29.767 --> 23:33.602
Then he met this woman
and she had a huge problem,

23:33.637 --> 23:38.574
so he tried to help her,
and her friend got really angry

23:38.609 --> 23:40.542
and he ended up with
only one kneecap.

23:40.577 --> 23:43.081
And now his mum's doing pornos

23:43.116 --> 23:46.768
and his dad's a junkie
and he never sees them.

23:47.828 --> 23:50.911
Except on the internet,
and then he has to pay for it!

23:50.946 --> 23:53.195
I mean, how unfair is that?

23:53.196 --> 23:58.077
- I never thought you'd fail as a father!
- I haven't failed as a father!

23:58.112 --> 24:00.587
You've let your kids down!
They're in the car,

24:00.622 --> 24:04.353
all that time when those fucking
bills were coming in...

24:04.388 --> 24:06.556
How long was that?
Cos when I looked...

24:06.591 --> 24:09.888
I'm so fed up!
I can't go on like this, Rob.

24:09.923 --> 24:13.185
I swear to God,
I've had it up to here with you.

24:15.811 --> 24:17.687
Drop me and the kids at the airport.
I'm going to my mum's.

24:17.722 --> 24:18.746
No!

24:18.781 --> 24:20.665
Get back in the car, Katie!

24:20.700 --> 24:23.760
Mum, we can't afford the flights
to Malaga. We're broke!

24:23.795 --> 24:25.690
You want to sleep
with your dad on the streets?

24:25.725 --> 24:27.042
It won't come to that!

24:27.077 --> 24:29.238
Well, where else
are we going to stay?!

24:29.273 --> 24:30.497
Fix it, Rob.

24:31.579 --> 24:34.821
Or I'm getting in the car
and I am leaving with the children.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.707
There is someone we can stay with.

24:42.170 --> 24:43.148
Who?

24:54.196 --> 24:55.732
Good morning, Naomi.

24:56.279 --> 24:58.361
You're looking sexy.

24:58.396 --> 25:00.444
You heard of a shower?

25:00.479 --> 25:01.859
What do you want?

25:01.894 --> 25:05.386
This is difficult, OK?
But we've lost our house.

25:05.421 --> 25:07.322
Oh, that was careless.

25:07.357 --> 25:08.468
So what?

25:08.503 --> 25:10.801
We need somewhere to stay.

25:12.335 --> 25:14.724
Your house is pretty empty
at the moment.

25:15.781 --> 25:17.690
You're having a fucking laugh.

25:17.725 --> 25:21.115
Yes, Naomi, I'm kidding that
my parents have no money, no house

25:21.150 --> 25:22.651
and are about to split up.

25:24.188 --> 25:26.615
I'm sorry, but...

25:26.650 --> 25:29.006
It's not my problem.

25:29.041 --> 25:31.430
Oh, but it is.
Cos it's Emily's problem.

25:31.465 --> 25:34.286
She's your girlfriend.
That makes it your problem.

25:36.783 --> 25:38.205
No lesbian digs?

25:39.375 --> 25:40.660
That, I can't promise.

25:45.408 --> 25:47.217
I'm gonna sort this.

25:48.485 --> 25:50.783
I'll be back later.

25:54.648 --> 25:57.060
Running away again?

26:00.605 --> 26:03.312
He's gone to look for
somewhere to live, actually.

26:05.549 --> 26:07.085
I'm not going in there.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.795
Please, Mum.

26:09.919 --> 26:12.205
You've got nowhere else to go.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.734
Please?

26:30.707 --> 26:33.119
We've run out of cereals.

26:33.154 --> 26:34.945
Garibaldi?

26:36.141 --> 26:38.280
Thank you.

26:42.447 --> 26:45.632
Look at her, swanning about
as if she's done nothing wrong.

26:45.667 --> 26:47.143
She hasn't.

26:47.178 --> 26:49.988
I want the best for Emily,
and she isn't.

26:50.023 --> 26:51.531
How do you know?

26:51.566 --> 26:55.707
Mums know these things.
You'll realise that one day.

26:59.645 --> 27:01.624
Are you really going to leave Dad?

27:05.404 --> 27:08.612
When your dad and I got married,
we had nothing.

27:08.647 --> 27:11.373
We spent years working and saving,

27:11.408 --> 27:15.538
so that you kids could have the best
of everything. And for what?

27:16.713 --> 27:18.078
It's all gone.

27:19.435 --> 27:22.770
I never thought we'd split up.

27:22.805 --> 27:25.865
But then I never thought
I'd be evicted from my home

27:25.900 --> 27:27.894
or that my daughter would be a...

27:29.383 --> 27:31.283
...so rebellious.

27:36.127 --> 27:38.869
People always let you down, princess.

27:41.011 --> 27:42.797
They fuck things up.

27:43.937 --> 27:45.484
Not you, though.

27:48.065 --> 27:51.501
Mum, I need to tell you something.

27:52.561 --> 27:56.952
I know everything's going wrong
at the moment but... it's just...

27:58.050 --> 28:00.507
...I went to the doctor's
the other day, and...

28:10.443 --> 28:12.115
Fuck's sake.

28:28.409 --> 28:29.564
You could have called.

28:29.599 --> 28:32.097
- You've been out all night.
- I know.

28:32.132 --> 28:35.408
Can you blame me? And now they're
here. We've got enough problems.

28:35.443 --> 28:36.189
Stop it, Em!

28:36.224 --> 28:40.140
All the shit she put us through,
you let her march into our home.

28:40.175 --> 28:43.025
She's your mum.
She's a selfish cow, is what she is.

28:43.060 --> 28:44.326
Emily?

28:44.361 --> 28:46.515
Whatever! Stay here.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.825
Don't expect me to care,
cos I don't.

28:48.860 --> 28:52.250
It's just for a couple of days while
we get ourselves out of this pickle.

28:52.285 --> 28:54.485
Stay out of my way.

28:54.520 --> 28:57.592
This is my house.
I live here with my girlfriend.

28:57.627 --> 28:59.436
And we're having a barbecue.

28:59.471 --> 29:00.672
All right?

29:00.707 --> 29:02.004
Whatever you say, love.

29:13.968 --> 29:16.573
I'm going to finish emptying the car.

30:10.806 --> 30:13.001
Wow, isn't this peachy?

30:18.592 --> 30:19.923
Who's got any more pills?

30:21.796 --> 30:23.051
Effy?

30:23.086 --> 30:25.092
Don't you think you've had enough?

30:25.127 --> 30:27.099
Don't think. Makes life much easier.

30:27.134 --> 30:29.063
Naomi, darling?

30:29.098 --> 30:31.646
Got any more of your special powder?

30:31.681 --> 30:32.967
No? Don't, Em.

30:33.002 --> 30:34.538
Where's Cook when you need him, eh?

30:35.925 --> 30:38.871
Somebody phone for more pills.

30:40.446 --> 30:43.347
Another fun day at
Mrs. and Mrs. Campbell's.

30:45.410 --> 30:48.573
Come on!
What's wrong with everyone?

30:49.608 --> 30:51.052
Turn the music up.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.274
Come on, you boring bastards.

31:14.966 --> 31:18.333
Can I interest you ladies in
a "cooked to perfection" burger?

31:22.801 --> 31:24.177
Don't think so.

31:29.294 --> 31:31.899
Hey, babes. Did you miss me?

32:00.041 --> 32:03.238
- D'you want me to ask everyone
to leave? - Thanks, Thomas.

32:03.273 --> 32:04.895
What's the point?

32:04.930 --> 32:06.989
It's all fucked anyway.

32:14.163 --> 32:16.461
What the fuck
are you doing, Emily?

32:21.072 --> 32:24.997
Emily, fucking stop this shit now!

32:34.535 --> 32:38.323
Naomi, darling, am I
making you nice and wet?

32:38.358 --> 32:41.961
Fuck you!
This is a fucking pantomime.

32:44.461 --> 32:46.372
Fuck you right back.

32:46.407 --> 32:47.811
Ems, stop it.

32:47.846 --> 32:49.173
Stay out of this.

32:49.208 --> 32:51.392
What? Want to fuck her, is that it?

32:51.427 --> 32:54.292
Maybe I do. So what?

32:54.327 --> 32:56.767
That's enough!

32:56.802 --> 32:59.208
What's this all about?

33:02.639 --> 33:04.607
It's none of your business.

33:06.126 --> 33:08.037
I fucked the dead girl.

33:09.563 --> 33:12.714
I fucked Sophia
and gave her the drugs

33:12.749 --> 33:15.096
and now she's punishing me for it.

33:15.131 --> 33:17.365
I knew you'd screw her up.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.599
Hey! Good news, everyone.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.636
I found us a caravan.

33:23.321 --> 33:24.780
What have I missed?

33:24.815 --> 33:26.897
Why don't you all
just fuck off?

33:26.932 --> 33:28.579
Look at you.

33:28.614 --> 33:33.119
Pretending to be happy families,
pretending to love each other.

33:33.154 --> 33:35.802
Don't you dare speak to me like that.

33:35.837 --> 33:37.296
Get off your high horse.

33:37.331 --> 33:40.607
I can't... I can't be here any more.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.705
Bit melodramatic.

33:46.740 --> 33:48.755
Remind you of anyone?

33:52.260 --> 33:54.296
Stop it!

33:56.521 --> 33:58.034
Come on, son.

34:02.753 --> 34:03.947
Em...

34:45.696 --> 34:48.290
I'm coming, I've just got to...
I'll catch up with you.

34:48.324 --> 34:49.204
See ya later!

34:54.945 --> 34:57.516
Merde! Sorry!

34:59.368 --> 35:01.222
Ah! Super merde!

35:01.257 --> 35:02.489
JJ!

35:02.524 --> 35:03.722
Emily!

35:05.116 --> 35:06.469
JJ!

35:11.613 --> 35:13.649
I think they've all gone out.

35:13.684 --> 35:15.108
Bollocks.

35:17.992 --> 35:20.495
You gonna stand there
till they get back?

35:22.777 --> 35:24.881
Yes, yes, I'll get you
a towel and...

35:26.020 --> 35:27.362
...Putain!

35:29.642 --> 35:31.451
Just sit down.

35:36.673 --> 35:38.550
Bit of a pickle!

35:48.392 --> 35:50.531
Do you think I'm a bitch, Thomas?

35:55.182 --> 35:58.322
I think you are Katie.
You should always be you.

36:02.644 --> 36:04.321
You're strong and...

36:04.356 --> 36:07.757
I'm just too aggressive,
just like my fucking mum.

36:09.721 --> 36:12.114
I know it. I am a bitch.

36:12.149 --> 36:15.312
Everyone relies on you
to tell the truth, Katie.

36:15.347 --> 36:17.092
They need you.

36:21.372 --> 36:24.284
That thing you do - is it for real?

36:26.708 --> 36:28.448
What thing?

36:29.551 --> 36:31.849
The lovely honourable thing.

36:34.003 --> 36:35.905
I'm not.

36:35.940 --> 36:37.737
I screw up so often.

36:37.738 --> 36:39.638
Panda, college...

36:41.074 --> 36:42.712
...everything.

36:44.288 --> 36:47.360
Right now I'm Monsieur Screw.

37:08.785 --> 37:10.277
D'you fancy me?

37:10.312 --> 37:11.714
Just checking.

37:11.749 --> 37:13.117
Of course.

37:25.799 --> 37:27.528
I can't have kids.

37:30.531 --> 37:32.453
They say I can't have kids...

37:33.502 --> 37:34.844
...ever.

37:37.462 --> 37:39.259
And you're sad?

37:41.996 --> 37:44.749
You think maybe no man
will ever want you?

37:47.415 --> 37:51.670
But I am a man, and I think you're
a beautiful, magnificent woman.

37:54.033 --> 37:56.547
Panda was an idiot
not to forgive you.

37:58.673 --> 38:00.300
I was the idiot.

38:01.447 --> 38:02.857
I wasn't honourable.

38:11.872 --> 38:13.838
We can be friends.

38:13.873 --> 38:15.804
Yes, I'd like that.

38:16.844 --> 38:18.402
Me too.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.460
Give me five minutes.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.166
Mum?

40:23.766 --> 40:25.870
Mum... I can't have children.

40:33.547 --> 40:37.961
I went to the doctor's yesterday and
they said there's nothing they can do.

40:42.293 --> 40:46.206
I wanted to tell you,
but you were too busy shouting.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.408
It's all about you.

40:50.718 --> 40:52.754
I don't want to let you down,

40:52.789 --> 40:54.929
but you let me down.

40:58.313 --> 41:00.895
I really needed you
and you weren't there.

41:00.930 --> 41:03.190
My baby girl.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.119
It doesn't matter, Mum.

41:06.154 --> 41:09.021
The house and the money.
I don't want it.

41:11.004 --> 41:13.029
I'm not going to be you.

41:14.198 --> 41:17.326
I just want a mum who loves me,
no matter what.

41:17.361 --> 41:20.212
I do love you, no matter what.

41:21.644 --> 41:23.418
I'm so sorry.

41:24.464 --> 41:26.841
And we love you, Mum.

41:26.842 --> 41:28.992
So appreciate us.

41:30.033 --> 41:32.069
Stop trying to push us away.

41:36.919 --> 41:38.329
Jen.

41:50.386 --> 41:51.933
I love you.

41:59.195 --> 42:01.049
You stupid bastard!

42:02.193 --> 42:03.888
I'm sorry.

42:29.999 --> 42:31.763
They're using tongues
and everything.
