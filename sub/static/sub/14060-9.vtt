WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:00.429
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on when calls the heart...</i>

00:00.001 --> 00:04.436
I am strongly requesting
an immediate transfer

00:04.438 --> 00:05.437
To a new post.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.006
Jack, are you jealous?

00:07.008 --> 00:08.507
[abigail]: What if I could
re-open the cafe?

00:08.509 --> 00:10.342
It would be
a great new start for me.

00:10.344 --> 00:14.246
Since you set foot
in coal valley.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.048
-Jack, I...
-You don't have to say anything.

00:17.317 --> 00:20.619
You should all be very proud
of these test results.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.655
And as a reward,

00:23.657 --> 00:25.791
We are going to be
spending some time

00:25.793 --> 00:28.360
Outside of the classroom
next week.

00:28.362 --> 00:32.064
We are going to be studying
the scientific field

00:32.066 --> 00:34.533
Of entomology.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.468
Does anyone know
what "entomology" means?

00:36.470 --> 00:40.572
Entomology is
the study of insects.

00:40.574 --> 00:44.576
But for today,
class is dismissed.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.779
See you all soon.

00:46.781 --> 00:50.282
Okay, don't forget
your lunch pails.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.583
Bye.

00:51.585 --> 00:52.518
Come on, hustle.

00:54.621 --> 00:56.388
Afternoon...

00:56.390 --> 00:57.790
Constable.

00:57.792 --> 01:01.326
Actually I'm here
in an unofficial capacity.

01:01.328 --> 01:04.396
Oh, I see.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.598
I've come to ask
for your hand.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.200
I beg your pardon.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.369
Your hand, may I have it?

01:13.240 --> 01:17.142
I would like to invite you
to join me for supper

01:17.144 --> 01:18.477
This Saturday night.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.512
The pleasure
of your company

01:20.514 --> 01:22.748
Would be truly
appreciated.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.683
Why are you being so formal?

01:24.685 --> 01:26.318
Well, if you remember,

01:26.320 --> 01:28.220
My last attempt
at inviting you to supper

01:28.222 --> 01:29.421
Didn't end well.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.723
This time,

01:31.725 --> 01:33.392
I want to be perfectly clear

01:33.394 --> 01:36.361
That my invitation
does not require you to cook.

01:36.363 --> 01:41.567
I appreciate
your lovely invitation,

01:41.569 --> 01:44.103
And I accept.

01:45.238 --> 01:46.438
Okay.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.574
[laughs]

01:50.610 --> 01:52.644
Is that it?

01:52.646 --> 01:54.546
Uh, yeah.

01:54.548 --> 01:58.183
Then may I have my hand back?

01:58.185 --> 02:00.285
[chuckling]

02:01.688 --> 02:05.424
I shall assume that this supper
does not imply

02:05.426 --> 02:08.360
The beginning
of a possible courtship.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.330
You've made it very clear
that mounties do not have wives.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.698
If they wanted you
to have a wife,

02:12.700 --> 02:14.299
They would have
issued you one.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.467
Did I say that?

02:15.469 --> 02:16.602
[chuckles]

02:16.604 --> 02:18.337
Several times.

02:18.339 --> 02:21.406
That does sound like
something I'd say.

02:21.408 --> 02:24.643
So I will see you
Saturday night for supper.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.644
Yes, see you
Saturday night

02:25.646 --> 02:27.613
For supper.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.615
And elizabeth,

02:29.617 --> 02:32.718
Please do consider this
an act of courtship.

03:10.490 --> 03:11.723
You must be jack thornton.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.825
Yes, I am.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.227
Who might you be, sir?

03:15.229 --> 03:17.763
Constable patrick o'reilly.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.731
And where is
your horse, constable?

03:19.733 --> 03:22.201
Well, she wanted to make
a grand entrance.

03:25.405 --> 03:27.739
And who might she be?

03:27.741 --> 03:30.709
[screams in delight]
ah! My goodness!

03:30.711 --> 03:33.579
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my goodness!

03:33.581 --> 03:35.247
What are you
doing here?

03:35.249 --> 03:36.782
Well, you didn't think

03:36.784 --> 03:37.916
I was going to let you
have all the fun

03:37.918 --> 03:39.785
Out in the wild,
wild west, did you?

03:39.787 --> 03:42.254
You came all by yourself?

03:42.256 --> 03:43.589
Daddy got me
my own personal mountie

03:43.591 --> 03:44.756
As an escort.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.358
[giggling in delight]

03:47.527 --> 03:48.627
[gasping in disbelief]

03:49.796 --> 03:51.930
Of course,
I am much more interested

03:51.932 --> 03:53.599
In meeting your man
in red serge.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.701
[giggling]

03:55.703 --> 03:56.668
Oh, look out for the, um...

03:58.838 --> 04:00.372
[clearing throat]

04:00.374 --> 04:01.840
[suppressed giggles]

04:01.842 --> 04:03.909
That didn't happen.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.478
You said you wanted to
experience the wild west.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.779
And here I am,

04:07.781 --> 04:08.580
Into it
with both feet,

04:08.582 --> 04:10.616
So to speak.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.284
Hi!

04:12.286 --> 04:13.752
I'm julie thatcher,

04:13.754 --> 04:15.821
Elizabeth's sister.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.923
A pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

04:18.825 --> 04:19.891
[sighs deeply]

04:24.731 --> 04:28.600
[â™ª]

04:36.609 --> 04:38.577
Here we go.

04:38.579 --> 04:41.013
Thank you so much,
mrs. Stanton.

04:41.015 --> 04:43.282
Oh, please,
call me abigail.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.883
H-how long did you say
you'd be staying?

04:44.885 --> 04:46.985
Don't be alarmed.

04:46.987 --> 04:50.722
For julie, this is hardly
a week's worth of clothes.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.857
Well, you never
know what outfit

04:51.859 --> 04:55.494
An occasion might call for.

04:55.496 --> 04:58.497
For not sending
advance warning of my visit.

04:58.499 --> 05:01.566
I wanted to
surprise elizabeth.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.669
Something she's been doing
since she came out of the womb.

05:03.671 --> 05:04.836
Feet first, no less.

05:06.005 --> 05:07.406
Well, it's
no trouble at all.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.708
We're happy to have you.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.643
I love your home.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.644
It's so...

05:12.646 --> 05:14.346
Rustic,

05:14.348 --> 05:17.783
I think what julie
meant to say is--

05:17.785 --> 05:20.686
"rustic" and "quaint"
work quite well

05:20.688 --> 05:22.487
For this town.

05:27.093 --> 05:28.994
So, when are you
going to tell me

05:28.996 --> 05:30.696
What's really going on?

05:30.698 --> 05:31.997
Pardon me?

05:31.999 --> 05:34.066
Between you
and that delectable mountie?

05:34.068 --> 05:35.867
You must mean jack thornton?

05:35.869 --> 05:36.935
Mm-hmm.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.537
We're just friends.

05:38.539 --> 05:41.506
I saw the way
you were looking at him.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.608
Does he feel
the same way about you?

05:43.610 --> 05:45.444
Who says how I'm feeling?

05:45.446 --> 05:46.578
Please...

05:46.580 --> 05:49.081
It's as if there's gravity
between you.

05:49.083 --> 05:50.949
Like the earth
pulling on the moon.

05:50.951 --> 05:51.917
You're being bombastic.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.952
There was no gravity.

05:54.887 --> 05:56.688
Fine.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.691
But since when do we keep
secrets from each other?

05:59.693 --> 06:02.794
[sighing]

06:02.796 --> 06:04.796
If you must know,

06:04.798 --> 06:06.565
He asked me out for dinner
this Saturday night,

06:06.567 --> 06:08.367
And I accepted.

06:08.369 --> 06:09.935
It's his first clear
expression of interest.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.737
[squealing] I knew it.

06:11.739 --> 06:14.639
This is like something
right out of a romance novel.

06:14.641 --> 06:17.709
A beautiful,
vulnerable young teacher

06:17.711 --> 06:18.910
Comes to
a farming town--

06:18.912 --> 06:22.614
Which is why
they call it "coal valley."

06:22.616 --> 06:23.615
Oh!

06:23.617 --> 06:25.016
Even better.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.752
Then, something
is awakened inside of her

06:26.754 --> 06:27.986
By a virile man of the law

06:27.988 --> 06:29.888
In a red
serge jacket...

06:29.890 --> 06:32.691
"awakened?" "virile?"

06:32.693 --> 06:36.027
We went from bombast,
to melodrama, to obscene.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.663
So where is he
taking you?

06:38.665 --> 06:40.399
On a horse-drawn carriage ride?

06:40.401 --> 06:42.934
It should be white,
like cinderella.

06:42.936 --> 06:46.104
This is not a fairy tale.
I'm not a princess.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.739
Then to a romantic
french bistro

06:47.741 --> 06:50.575
For crepes
and sweet toffee liqueur?

06:50.577 --> 06:53.412
He's probably taking me
to the saloon.

06:53.414 --> 06:54.012
What, you mean
that dusty old hole

06:54.014 --> 06:55.414
You teach in?

06:55.416 --> 06:56.014
It's the thought that counts.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.482
And more importantly,

06:57.484 --> 06:58.784
There will be no meddling
in my love life.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.185
Understood?

07:00.187 --> 07:02.454
Me? Meddle?
I never meddle.

07:03.857 --> 07:07.759
I invest emotionally
in your well-being.

07:07.761 --> 07:11.863
And when my sister tells me
she's in love,

07:11.865 --> 07:12.898
Of course, I want to!

07:12.900 --> 07:14.933
Love? I said
nothing of the sort.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.769
"love life"
is a general term for...

07:17.771 --> 07:20.772
Friendly companionship
between the sexes.

07:20.774 --> 07:21.807
Well...

07:21.809 --> 07:23.809
If you say so.

07:29.582 --> 07:32.050
[abigail]:
Well, thank you very much.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.853
You have a lovely day.

07:36.522 --> 07:38.056
Julie, how was
your bakewell pudding?

07:38.058 --> 07:39.691
It was most
delicious.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.827
My sister wrote me
about your baking,

07:41.829 --> 07:44.062
And I must say,
she was right.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.998
Well, I consider that
a real compliment.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.867
Best of luck today.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.635
Thank you.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.113
Well...

08:02.115 --> 08:02.848
It appears as if
I underestimated you,

08:02.850 --> 08:04.883
Mrs. Stanton.

08:04.885 --> 08:05.917
I didn't think you'd be able
to cobble this together,

08:05.919 --> 08:07.686
But you have.

08:07.688 --> 08:11.690
What hard work set to a dream
can achieve.

08:11.692 --> 08:12.924
There you go.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.659
If I may, a cup of coffee
and something sweet?

08:14.661 --> 08:16.228
Absolutely.
Coming right up.

08:16.230 --> 08:17.863
-Good morning, jack.
-Good morning.

08:19.765 --> 08:23.101
I was wondering if I could
trouble you for the usual?

08:23.103 --> 08:25.837
Oh, you have no idea
how wonderful that sounds.

08:25.839 --> 08:29.074
I actually have a customer
who wants the usual.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.842
Oh, by the way,

08:30.844 --> 08:32.744
I have everything all ready
for Saturday night.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.079
Thank you.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.981
I so appreciate your help.

08:40.653 --> 08:42.153
Well, here you go, mr. Gowen.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.755
Ah, it looks wonderful.

08:43.757 --> 08:46.691
Though I can't imagine
it can be as sweet as you.

08:47.894 --> 08:48.793
[chuckles awkwardly]

08:52.632 --> 08:54.132
Oh, that man
gets on my nerves.

08:55.568 --> 08:57.969
I can understand that.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.171
There are so many
different kinds of insects,

09:00.173 --> 09:02.574
That we study them
in different subgroups,

09:02.576 --> 09:04.075
Or families.

09:04.077 --> 09:09.114
For example, melittology
is the study of bees--

09:09.116 --> 09:12.083
I've read that it can also
be called "apiology"--

09:12.085 --> 09:13.852
Thank you, julie,

09:13.854 --> 09:16.021
But that's actually
a sub-discipline,

09:16.023 --> 09:19.591
Specific to...

09:19.593 --> 09:21.326
Honey bees!

09:21.328 --> 09:25.830
Oh, well then, my...
Api-ologies.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.132
[laughter]

09:27.134 --> 09:28.934
Now then, we are going

09:28.936 --> 09:31.803
On something of a treasure hunt
next week,

09:31.805 --> 09:33.638
With all of nature's
beautiful little creatures

09:33.640 --> 09:34.739
Being our prize.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.741
We'll be looking under rocks,

09:36.743 --> 09:38.143
And pulling the bark
off of trees, and--

09:38.145 --> 09:39.244
And by "we,"

09:39.246 --> 09:41.046
She means all of you.

09:41.048 --> 09:44.683
Your very own miss thatcher
is terrified of bugs, and--

09:44.685 --> 09:46.251
That's enough, julie.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.154
I, too, will be
hunting for insects

09:49.156 --> 09:51.623
Just like the rest of you.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.858
I look forward to seeing that.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.994
She's mortified, I tell you...

09:55.996 --> 09:57.062
[giggles]

09:57.064 --> 09:59.864
[class laughing]

09:59.866 --> 10:02.000
So how did someone with
your rank and experience

10:02.002 --> 10:04.102
End up with
this escort assignment?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.971
I volunteered for it.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.906
Why?

10:07.908 --> 10:10.075
Well, I've been working
in north burlington

10:10.077 --> 10:11.042
And elwood ridge

10:11.044 --> 10:12.911
The last 15 years.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.380
The job was everything
they promised it would be.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.949
Danger, excitement, travel,

10:17.951 --> 10:21.686
Along with the satisfaction
of keeping people safe.

10:21.688 --> 10:24.022
And, what,
you've had enough?

10:24.024 --> 10:25.857
Never.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.960
But after I met sarah,
everything changed.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.795
We got married last year.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.298
She's expecting
our first child.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.133
Congratulations, patrick.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.635
Yeah, I never
thought

10:36.637 --> 10:39.938
But life has a way of
changing your priorities.

10:39.940 --> 10:40.939
[chuckles knowingly]

10:40.941 --> 10:44.009
I'm getting too old
to be chasing bad guys.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.110
It's your turn

10:45.112 --> 10:47.078
To round 'em up
and put 'em in jail.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.179
Tell me everything
I need to know

10:48.181 --> 10:49.180
About coal valley,

10:49.182 --> 10:50.148
And you're free to go.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.017
This is for you.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.721
Thanks.

11:03.963 --> 11:04.963
I've been reassigned.

11:04.965 --> 11:05.830
Yes.

11:09.268 --> 11:11.736
You do want to go?

11:11.738 --> 11:13.805
It's just...

11:13.807 --> 11:15.206
I've sort of settled in here

11:15.208 --> 11:17.976
And made may peace
with this place.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.178
I put in for a request
so long ago,

11:20.180 --> 11:22.180
I'd almost forgotten about it.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.150
Request?

11:25.152 --> 11:26.751
From what I heard,
you made a demand.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.920
Well, when I first got here,

11:28.922 --> 11:31.122
I won't deny
that I wanted to leave.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.358
This place wasn't
what I signed up for.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.795
It looks like
you have a decision to make.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.751
[gasping in delight]

11:59.753 --> 12:02.987
You look gorgeous.

12:02.989 --> 12:04.456
What smells so good?

12:04.458 --> 12:07.759
Oh, abigail must just be
experimenting for the cafe.

12:07.761 --> 12:08.793
[knock on door]

12:08.795 --> 12:09.861
That must be him.

12:09.863 --> 12:10.995
Why am I so nervous?

12:10.997 --> 12:13.064
You're supposed to be.
[giggles]

12:13.066 --> 12:14.399
You never get like this.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.135
Well, I've had
more suitors than you.

12:26.378 --> 12:29.247
Jack thornton, you look...

12:29.249 --> 12:31.382
So do you...

12:33.452 --> 12:36.087
Here, I brought this for you.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.757
It's beautiful.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.192
May I?

12:41.194 --> 12:43.061
Please.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.230
Not that way.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.799
Why?

13:32.178 --> 13:35.280
I thought you were
taking me to the saloon.

13:35.282 --> 13:38.383
Well, this place seems
a little more appropriate.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.018
Welcome to abigail's cafe.

13:42.087 --> 13:44.222
Shall we?

14:07.012 --> 14:10.281
How long have you been
planning this?

14:11.450 --> 14:14.252
That's a secret.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.020
[chuckles]

14:23.262 --> 14:24.362
[handle cranks]

14:24.364 --> 14:27.498
[music begins]

14:40.246 --> 14:41.112
[giggles]

14:42.348 --> 14:44.582
I have to admit,

14:44.584 --> 14:46.117
I never would have
pegged you

14:46.119 --> 14:47.552
For such a romantic.

14:47.554 --> 14:50.255
Well, I had a little help.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.490
So...

14:52.492 --> 14:54.292
You don't normally

14:54.294 --> 14:57.128
Woo your other women
like this?

14:57.130 --> 14:58.396
I haven't really
had the opportunity

14:58.398 --> 15:00.331
To woo many women.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.499
[chuckling]

15:01.501 --> 15:03.234
You must think me naive.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.369
No.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.070
Sadly, it's true.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.338
The life of a mountie

15:07.340 --> 15:11.142
Doesn't leave too much
time for courting.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.278
I feel somewhat lacking

15:13.280 --> 15:17.649
In the area of romance.

15:17.651 --> 15:20.218
I feel that
my efforts tonight

15:20.220 --> 15:22.353
May pale in comparison

15:22.355 --> 15:24.188
To the legions of suitors
you had back home.

15:24.190 --> 15:25.256
[laughs]

15:25.258 --> 15:28.059
Legions...

15:28.061 --> 15:29.394
Far from it,

15:29.396 --> 15:31.462
I assure you.

15:31.464 --> 15:34.332
Then I feel really lucky.

15:37.069 --> 15:40.972
Elizabeth...

15:40.974 --> 15:42.373
Elizabeth...

15:42.375 --> 15:44.542
You dance beautifully.

15:48.180 --> 15:51.049
Thank you.

15:54.219 --> 15:57.088
I'm glad you asked me
out to dinner.

15:57.090 --> 16:00.124
Me, too.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.542
Oh...

16:17.544 --> 16:20.278
You must tell me everything.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.747
[sighs dreamily]

16:22.749 --> 16:25.383
It was the most
enchanting evening

16:25.385 --> 16:27.652
Of my entire life.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.387
It was beyond anything
I could ever even...

16:29.389 --> 16:31.322
Dare to dream.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.524
It was like
something out of a--

16:33.526 --> 16:35.326
Romance novel?

16:35.328 --> 16:36.694
Yes.

16:36.696 --> 16:41.099
But I've never read anything
quite so romantic.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.600
So, what will
the next chapter bring?

16:42.602 --> 16:45.503
I don't know,

16:45.505 --> 16:48.306
But it sure feels like
something changed tonight,

16:48.308 --> 16:51.476
Like we're swimming
in much different waters.

16:51.478 --> 16:52.577
And skinny dipping
at that.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.078
Julie!

16:54.080 --> 16:57.515
I was speaking
metaphorically, of course.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.584
So, what's next?

17:01.387 --> 17:04.022
He wants to take me
on a ride to his favorite spot.

17:04.024 --> 17:06.457
He says he has something
he wants to discuss with me.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.559
A proposal!

17:08.561 --> 17:09.594
[laughing] no...

17:09.596 --> 17:12.363
It's much too early for that.

17:12.365 --> 17:16.567
Love at first sight
often leads to short courtships.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.469
[both squealing]

17:18.471 --> 17:21.139
This is so exciting!

17:26.378 --> 17:28.112
How did it go?

17:28.114 --> 17:30.214
We were having
such a nice evening,

17:30.216 --> 17:32.583
I didn't know
how to bring it up.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.519
Well, you're gonna
have to do it soon.

17:34.521 --> 17:35.486
You're expected
in cape fullerton

17:35.488 --> 17:37.422
Within the next
two weeks.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.323
You could send word
that you're not coming,

17:39.325 --> 17:41.492
But after the fuss you made
to leave here,

17:41.494 --> 17:44.228
A transfer refusal could be
the end of your career.

17:49.668 --> 17:51.602
Hello, jack.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.304
Can I get you your usual?

17:53.306 --> 17:54.739
No, I'm okay.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.075
I just wanted to come by
and thank you

17:57.077 --> 17:58.509
For the wonderful dinner
last night.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.344
It was my pleasure.

18:00.346 --> 18:01.612
I trust you had
a lovely evening.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.781
Very much so.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.516
Can I trust you to be discreet?

18:06.718 --> 18:08.753
Yes, of course.
What is it?

18:08.755 --> 18:12.323
Now, I haven't told
elizabeth this yet, but...

18:12.325 --> 18:14.292
I've received some news.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.394
I've been granted a new post--

18:16.396 --> 18:18.196
A post I've always
dreamt of having.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.298
You're leaving coal valley?

18:20.300 --> 18:21.432
I have orders

18:21.434 --> 18:23.534
I need to fulfill.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.636
I wouldn't be gone
permanently, but...

18:25.638 --> 18:27.438
But you can't be sure
that things will be the same

18:27.440 --> 18:29.307
When you return.

18:31.310 --> 18:35.113
Jack, you've got to tell her.

18:36.249 --> 18:39.750
Just when I thought it was
going to be a glorious day.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.188
Has he been bothering you?

18:44.190 --> 18:45.890
I could talk to him if you like.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.326
Oh, no, I'm quite capable
of rebuking his advances.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.627
And I have an iron skillet

18:49.629 --> 18:52.296
That makes a fine weapon
if need be.

18:56.435 --> 18:58.569
Jack?

18:58.571 --> 19:00.371
What is it?

19:00.373 --> 19:02.206
Nothing.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.142
Please, tell me.

19:09.248 --> 19:11.215
Now, I've done
my own inquiry

19:11.217 --> 19:12.550
Into this mine explosion.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.519
It appears the company
may have cut some corners

19:14.521 --> 19:17.388
Corners that might have led
to the disaster.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.691
I don't have
any hard proof yet.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.426
According to my research,

19:22.428 --> 19:25.229
It should have been prevented
with adequate safety measures.

19:26.732 --> 19:29.367
Are you okay?

19:30.903 --> 19:32.703
It's just that
my late-husband, noah,

19:32.705 --> 19:34.572
Was really locking horns
with henry gowen

19:34.574 --> 19:35.673
Months before the explosion.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.508
He wouldn't tell me why.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.577
He didn't want me
to worry, but...

19:39.579 --> 19:42.313
I wonder, could this be
what that was all about?

19:46.685 --> 19:49.587
I am so sorry if I upset you,

19:49.589 --> 19:51.856
And this is not something
that I would normally share

19:51.858 --> 19:53.291
So early in my investigation,

19:53.293 --> 19:55.793
But I may need
some help.

19:55.795 --> 19:59.330
Anything.

20:07.372 --> 20:10.341
Ugh, my feet are hurting,

20:10.343 --> 20:11.576
And they're freezing.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.411
Can I go back
to the classroom now?

20:13.413 --> 20:14.545
You were the one
who was so excited

20:14.547 --> 20:16.280
To join us on our
little insect hunt.

20:16.282 --> 20:17.448
Well, you could
have picked

20:17.450 --> 20:18.849
A more suitable day
for this.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.384
Well, you could
have picked

20:20.386 --> 20:22.320
A more suitable
pair of shoes.

20:24.523 --> 20:26.657
Hello,
constable thornton.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.559
What happens to
bring you by this time?

20:28.561 --> 20:31.329
Actually, we were just
out on patrol.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.964
Well, what
a happy coincidence

20:32.966 --> 20:34.699
You should just happen
upon elizabeth's class

20:34.701 --> 20:35.900
Here in the forest.

20:35.902 --> 20:36.834
Since you're here, jack,

20:36.836 --> 20:39.704
Maybe you have
some free time

20:39.706 --> 20:40.905
To take julie on a tour

20:40.907 --> 20:43.307
Of the surrounding
countryside?

20:43.309 --> 20:45.643
I would love to.

20:45.645 --> 20:48.746
However, I have some
paperwork back at the office.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.281
Constable o'reilly
is free.

20:50.283 --> 20:53.317
Because I would just love
to see the countryside!

20:53.319 --> 20:55.419
I just need to get
my riding boots.

20:59.825 --> 21:00.825
Thank you.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.360
My pleasure.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.794
[sighs]

21:03.796 --> 21:04.895
Julie was right,

21:04.897 --> 21:07.331
I'm not here by coincidence.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.867
I still need to
talk to you about.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.535
[gabe]:
Miss thatcher!

21:11.537 --> 21:12.637
Come and see
this slimy bug I found--

21:12.639 --> 21:13.804
[elizabeth gasps]
gabe!

21:13.806 --> 21:14.872
Just...
Give me a moment.

21:14.874 --> 21:17.341
Just a moment, please?

21:20.479 --> 21:21.412
[chuckles]

21:22.914 --> 21:24.749
What was it
you wanted to discuss?

21:24.751 --> 21:25.950
It's okay.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.552
I'll let you get back
to your slimy bug.

21:28.554 --> 21:31.389
There's plenty of time
for us to talk on our picnic.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.891
Perhaps tomorrow, after class?

21:35.460 --> 21:36.627
I'll pack the food.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.462
Wonderful.

21:50.676 --> 21:51.575
Where are you going?

21:51.577 --> 21:52.877
Into the trees!

21:52.879 --> 21:55.446
I don't think that's
a very good idea.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.648
It could be
a bear habitat.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.851
And I am not interested in
messing with any grizzlies,

22:00.853 --> 22:01.952
Thank you very much.

22:01.954 --> 22:04.355
Well, where's your
sense of adventure?

22:04.357 --> 22:06.590
I left it
back at my last post.

22:06.592 --> 22:08.592
[sighs wearily]

22:08.594 --> 22:10.761
Look, we should be
getting back to town anyway.

22:12.431 --> 22:14.498
Just give me one moment.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.634
Stay here. Nature calls...

22:16.636 --> 22:17.702
Come on.

22:31.383 --> 22:32.917
Come on.

22:39.825 --> 22:42.693
Whoa, boy.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.362
Hello!

23:02.881 --> 23:04.482
Hello!

23:16.595 --> 23:18.062
Hello?
Is anybody in here?

23:23.602 --> 23:24.535
[cocking gun]

23:24.537 --> 23:25.469
Hold it right there.

23:33.712 --> 23:35.413
Don't shoot!
It's in my saddle bag.

23:36.615 --> 23:37.581
My money!

23:37.583 --> 23:38.783
Lady, I'm not gonna rob you.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.551
Just calm down, will ya?

23:40.553 --> 23:42.119
Oh.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.455
Sorry to be
so presumptuous,

23:44.457 --> 23:45.890
I'm not accustomed to
strange men

23:45.892 --> 23:50.494
Introducing themselves
by pointing a gun in my face.

23:52.964 --> 23:54.598
You're the one
who snuck in here

23:54.600 --> 23:56.567
And surprised me.

23:59.905 --> 24:02.873
You're bleeding.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.676
Some men were chasing me.

24:06.878 --> 24:08.813
What men?

24:08.815 --> 24:09.980
[shuddering]

24:11.950 --> 24:14.752
Outlaws.

24:14.754 --> 24:15.920
I got away,

24:15.922 --> 24:17.855
But my horse threw me,

24:17.857 --> 24:20.224
And I got tangled
in some barbed wire.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.725
There's a town
just a short ride away.

24:21.727 --> 24:23.894
I could take you to see
the company doctor.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.197
I'll be fine.

24:26.199 --> 24:30.100
I've read all about
you rough and tumble cowboys,

24:30.102 --> 24:31.869
But you can't just
rub some dirt in that wound

24:31.871 --> 24:33.537
And hope it'll mend.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.673
You need medical attention.

24:35.675 --> 24:39.910
Please, just...
Leave me be.

24:43.849 --> 24:45.749
[groaning]

24:45.751 --> 24:47.751
Well, I can't just let you
bleed to death.

24:47.753 --> 24:50.087
Then get me some bandages,

24:50.089 --> 24:51.989
And some alcohol,

24:51.991 --> 24:53.958
To keep it clean.

24:55.026 --> 24:58.028
Looks like you'll need
some food as well.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.964
And something for the pain?

24:59.966 --> 25:02.199
Yeah.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.634
Just don't go making this

25:03.636 --> 25:06.604
Anyone's business
in that town, okay?

25:06.606 --> 25:09.073
I need to know I can trust you.

25:10.141 --> 25:13.844
Well, you don't really
have a choice, now, do you?

25:13.846 --> 25:14.979
Listen, this is
for your safety

25:14.981 --> 25:17.047
As much as it is mine.

25:17.049 --> 25:18.883
Those outlaws
could still be out there,

25:18.885 --> 25:20.885
So, uh...

25:20.887 --> 25:22.953
You just make darn certain
you're not being followed.

25:22.955 --> 25:23.954
You understand?

25:26.191 --> 25:29.627
I'll be back tomorrow.

25:30.595 --> 25:31.929
Hey...

25:31.931 --> 25:33.898
What's your name?

25:33.900 --> 25:36.567
It's julie.

25:36.569 --> 25:40.671
Julie.
That's... That's real pretty.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.640
And what might your's be?

25:42.642 --> 25:44.575
Nathaniel.

25:44.577 --> 25:46.877
That's not some kind of alias?

25:47.846 --> 25:50.114
No, ma'am.

25:52.784 --> 25:54.718
I should go.

26:02.127 --> 26:03.260
[wincing]

26:03.262 --> 26:06.196
So, she just
left you waiting there?

26:06.198 --> 26:07.831
For nearly an hour.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.166
Said she couldn't find
the appropriate place

26:09.168 --> 26:11.835
To do her business.

26:11.837 --> 26:13.637
Clearly,
you were assigned

26:13.639 --> 26:15.806
The more challenging
of the thatcher sisters.

26:15.808 --> 26:19.176
I've tracked and arrested
lifelong criminals

26:19.178 --> 26:21.679
Who were easier
to manage than she was.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.047
[sighs] so,

26:23.049 --> 26:25.115
Were you able
to talk to elizabeth?

26:27.652 --> 26:29.019
We're going on a picnic
after school

26:29.021 --> 26:30.854
Tomorrow.

26:30.856 --> 26:32.122
So you've made a decision?

26:33.992 --> 26:36.927
Can you tell me anything
about what I'm headed into?

26:36.929 --> 26:41.098
Well, we're pursuing
several criminals right now.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.901
The most elusive
is the tolliver gang--

26:43.903 --> 26:46.070
Nate tolliver--
he's the brains.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.338
He's young,

26:47.340 --> 26:49.139
But he's managed to
outsmart the best of us.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.908
Yeah, I've heard about him.

26:50.910 --> 26:53.010
How many banks have they hit?

26:53.012 --> 26:54.712
Ten or so across this region,

26:54.714 --> 26:55.713
And it's not just banks,

26:55.715 --> 26:57.748
It's trains, stagecoaches,

26:57.750 --> 26:59.249
Anything really.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.151
He's dangerous, jack.

27:01.153 --> 27:03.887
Thinks nothing
of pulling a gun.

27:03.889 --> 27:06.624
Well, I look forward to
bringing him to justice.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.127
[door opens]

27:10.129 --> 27:11.228
Good evening.

27:11.230 --> 27:14.064
Good evening, mr. Gowen.

27:14.066 --> 27:16.100
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

27:16.102 --> 27:17.868
Yes, I thought now might be
a perfect opportunity

27:17.870 --> 27:20.170
To discuss how things went
in our first week.

27:20.172 --> 27:23.107
I don't think it's appropriate
that we're here alone.

27:24.677 --> 27:28.712
To cast any kind of aspersion
on your character.

27:28.714 --> 27:30.114
We are business partners.

27:30.116 --> 27:31.649
Yes, we are,

27:31.651 --> 27:33.017
But these are not
business hours.

27:33.019 --> 27:34.284
It's a shame.

27:34.286 --> 27:35.919
I think people
who do business together

27:35.921 --> 27:38.722
Should be able to be friendly.

27:38.724 --> 27:40.824
What if I were
to ask you for lunch?

27:40.826 --> 27:43.327
Well, I would very politely,

27:43.329 --> 27:45.229
And with as much grace
as possible,

27:45.231 --> 27:48.866
Turn you down.

27:48.868 --> 27:51.935
I'm not used to
taking no for an answer.

27:51.937 --> 27:55.205
Well then, this will be
a new experience for you.

27:57.976 --> 27:59.910
One lunch.

27:59.912 --> 28:02.012
I'll have my chef
prepare it for us.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.681
We will speak of business

28:03.683 --> 28:05.916
And it will be
strictly professional.

28:08.353 --> 28:11.989
Well, I suppose I could be
amenable to that.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.991
Very good.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.192
I'll pick up
at noon on Thursday?

28:15.194 --> 28:16.260
No.

28:16.262 --> 28:17.961
I think I'm quite capable

28:17.963 --> 28:20.164
Of finding my own way
to your office.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.833
As you wish.

28:22.835 --> 28:25.302
I like a woman
who knows her mind.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.204
Good evening.

28:38.818 --> 28:42.352
Would you mind raising up
your shirt a little?

28:42.354 --> 28:44.855
To expose the wound.

28:47.826 --> 28:49.093
[wincing]

28:50.195 --> 28:51.895
Oh...

28:53.065 --> 28:56.366
Can we please just
get this over with?

29:01.106 --> 29:02.005
[wincing]

29:02.007 --> 29:02.973
I'm sorry.

29:04.142 --> 29:05.409
Don't worry
about the pain,

29:05.411 --> 29:06.844
Just clean it up
as best you can.

29:09.848 --> 29:10.914
[wincing]

29:12.050 --> 29:13.383
I'll have you know,

29:13.385 --> 29:15.385
I didn't sleep a wink
last night.

29:16.988 --> 29:18.889
I was thinking of you, too.

29:20.091 --> 29:22.793
I was simply worried
for your safety,

29:22.795 --> 29:24.061
Staying out
in this dirty place

29:24.063 --> 29:25.295
All by yourself.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.865
Hiding from god knows what.

29:27.867 --> 29:31.201
I'm used to being on my own.

29:31.203 --> 29:35.873
This injury obviously wasn't
caused by barbed wire.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.141
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

29:37.143 --> 29:38.842
You came in here,

29:38.844 --> 29:40.878
And you caught me
by surprise.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.513
The truth of it is,

29:42.515 --> 29:43.947
The less you know about me,
the better,

29:43.949 --> 29:47.084
For both our sakes.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.119
Well, my sister
is seeing a mountie,

29:49.121 --> 29:50.521
Maybe he could track down
the men who did this to you.

29:50.523 --> 29:52.356
I said this was
no one else's business,

29:52.358 --> 29:54.424
Especially no mountie.

29:58.897 --> 30:00.130
Please, don't...

30:00.132 --> 30:01.064
Don't leave.

30:01.066 --> 30:03.133
I can explain.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.935
I think maybe you were right,

30:04.937 --> 30:06.236
The less I know--

30:06.238 --> 30:07.437
My brother,

30:07.439 --> 30:10.941
And his gang, he, um...

30:10.943 --> 30:13.277
They robbed a bank.

30:16.181 --> 30:18.182
I see.

30:18.184 --> 30:21.018
And you're obviously
part of that gang.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.353
I never had a choice.

30:23.355 --> 30:25.455
It's my older brother.

30:25.457 --> 30:28.292
If it weren't for joe...

30:28.294 --> 30:30.527
We were orphans,

30:30.529 --> 30:32.329
And he never
quit on me,

30:32.331 --> 30:35.199
So I can't
quit on him.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.467
But you need to break free
from your brother's clutches.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.870
Julie, he's all I got.

30:41.406 --> 30:44.041
But you're right,
of course, um...

30:44.043 --> 30:46.143
I have no interest
in living a life of crime.

30:46.145 --> 30:47.211
[wincing]

30:47.213 --> 30:49.413
I've, um, stood
between my brother

30:49.415 --> 30:51.215
And an innocent man

30:51.217 --> 30:52.349
More than once.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.084
That's how I got shot.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.353
Saving lives?

30:57.322 --> 30:59.189
Mm.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.992
You're a good man.

31:03.161 --> 31:05.996
I want to be.

31:07.632 --> 31:10.100
I can come back later
if mr. Gowen is busy.

31:10.102 --> 31:12.069
Mr. Gowen will be
right pleased

31:12.071 --> 31:13.403
With your visit.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.272
He's just out,

31:15.274 --> 31:18.108
But he should be
back soon, ma'am.

31:18.110 --> 31:20.077
Just, care to wait?

31:20.079 --> 31:21.511
Yes, thank you.

31:53.244 --> 31:56.446
[car engine rumbles outside]

32:20.405 --> 32:21.471
Good morning.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.073
Well, good morning.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.308
I'm here for our lunch.

32:27.211 --> 32:29.413
[elizabeth sighs]

32:29.415 --> 32:32.015
I can see why you wanted
to bring a camera.

32:32.017 --> 32:33.417
This is
an amazing view.

32:33.419 --> 32:35.419
Yes, it is.

32:36.454 --> 32:39.690
They issued one of these
for an investigation tool,

32:39.692 --> 32:42.259
But I haven't really had
much chance to use it

32:42.261 --> 32:43.994
Here in coal valley.

32:43.996 --> 32:45.095
Till now...

32:45.097 --> 32:46.263
[clicks shutter]

32:46.265 --> 32:47.431
[laughs]

32:47.433 --> 32:49.166
That's not fair.

32:49.168 --> 32:52.336
Why don't we take one
of the both of us?

32:52.338 --> 32:54.071
Okay.

32:56.107 --> 32:58.542
Come here.

33:00.345 --> 33:01.345
[sighs]

33:01.347 --> 33:03.447
Smile.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.082
I haven't stopped
since our supper.

33:08.453 --> 33:11.455
One, two, three...

33:11.457 --> 33:13.290
[clicks shutter]

33:13.292 --> 33:14.524
[laughs]

33:26.337 --> 33:29.506
Elizabeth, I have to
talk to you about something.

33:29.508 --> 33:33.577
When I first got to coal valley,
I was, uh...

33:33.579 --> 33:36.046
Unhappy with my posting.

33:36.048 --> 33:37.180
[laughs]

33:37.182 --> 33:39.349
You were furious.

33:39.351 --> 33:42.052
And I put in a transfer request
to cape fullerton.

33:42.054 --> 33:45.055
You wanted to be
where all the action is,

33:45.057 --> 33:47.491
And you were right
to be upset.

33:48.659 --> 33:50.594
You were diverted
from your dream.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.329
And I couldn't see
my purpose here.

33:54.332 --> 33:57.300
Are you saying that's changed?

33:57.302 --> 33:59.603
Have you...

33:59.605 --> 34:02.539
Found a new purpose?

34:02.541 --> 34:06.676
Well, it appears
my request has been granted.

34:08.546 --> 34:09.513
You-you have new orders?

34:09.515 --> 34:10.514
Yes.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.349
I am so sorry.

34:21.559 --> 34:24.327
It's my fault.

34:24.329 --> 34:26.363
He told me the truth
from the beginning.

34:26.365 --> 34:28.432
I always knew he was leaving.

34:28.434 --> 34:31.168
It was just a matter of
when he'd be transferred.

34:31.170 --> 34:35.806
He wasn't expecting
his transfer to come.

34:35.808 --> 34:37.407
I know he would never
ask you out

34:37.409 --> 34:38.442
Or pursue you--

34:38.444 --> 34:40.577
I was a diversion.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.780
Something to keep him occupied
before he left.

34:43.782 --> 34:47.150
You're correct in thinking
that he had no plans to stay

34:47.152 --> 34:50.253
Or to fall in love...

34:50.255 --> 34:51.755
But I believe he did.

34:56.561 --> 34:59.563
If he leaves,
he could get hurt,

34:59.565 --> 35:02.833
Or killed, or...

35:02.835 --> 35:06.269
He could meet somebody else.

35:06.271 --> 35:09.372
I might never see him again.

35:09.374 --> 35:11.741
If you two were meant
to be together,

35:11.743 --> 35:15.112
Then nothing
will stand in your way.

35:23.588 --> 35:25.222
Mornin', mountie jack.

35:25.224 --> 35:27.257
Morning, gabe.

35:27.259 --> 35:28.625
By the way,

35:28.627 --> 35:31.561
Thank you for all your help
on Saturday night.

35:31.563 --> 35:32.629
You're going to make
some young lady

35:32.631 --> 35:33.864
Very happy one day.

35:33.866 --> 35:36.299
Oh, I already know who it is.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.535
I knew from the moment
I laid eyes on her.

35:38.537 --> 35:39.703
Well, you may
surprise yourself.

35:39.705 --> 35:42.272
Your first love
is rarely your last.

35:42.274 --> 35:43.507
I know you think I'm foolish

35:43.509 --> 35:44.641
For knowing
who I'm going to marry,

35:44.643 --> 35:46.376
Being I'm so young,

35:46.378 --> 35:47.644
But sometimes, it happens.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.747
And your whole future
is clear as a bell.

35:59.624 --> 36:02.292
[crying softly]

36:03.361 --> 36:05.829
[door opens]

36:08.299 --> 36:09.866
Jack?

36:09.868 --> 36:11.902
I'm not going to do it.

36:11.904 --> 36:14.271
I am not leaving coal valley.

36:14.273 --> 36:15.705
Wait, but...

36:15.707 --> 36:17.741
Patrick's already here.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.676
They're not going to
station two mounties

36:19.678 --> 36:21.244
In this sleepy little town.

36:21.246 --> 36:24.614
But I am going to put in
an official appeal to stay.

36:24.616 --> 36:26.216
But that could mean...

36:26.218 --> 36:28.451
I know.

36:28.453 --> 36:30.320
Elizabeth,

36:30.322 --> 36:33.623
I know what the risks are
with my superiors,

36:33.625 --> 36:36.326
And I'm willing to take them...

36:37.261 --> 36:39.629
For you.

36:39.631 --> 36:41.665
[laughs gently]

36:44.735 --> 36:48.338
What?

36:48.340 --> 36:49.506
Jack...

36:49.508 --> 36:51.741
I can't...

36:51.743 --> 36:54.344
I can't let you do that.

36:54.346 --> 36:55.745
No.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.881
See, this is what I want.

36:57.883 --> 37:01.384
Who keeps you from
following your dreams.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.987
I can't.

37:03.989 --> 37:06.323
You'd only end up resenting me.

37:06.325 --> 37:07.958
Elizabeth, that is not true.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.759
You may not
think so now,

37:09.761 --> 37:12.395
But you will.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.664
You will.

37:14.666 --> 37:17.267
The same way that I could never
have forgiven my parents

37:17.269 --> 37:18.902
If they'd kept me
from coming out west

37:18.904 --> 37:22.339
In pursuit of my dreams.

37:23.307 --> 37:26.376
Jack...

37:28.346 --> 37:32.582
I am so sorry.
You have to do this.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.552
You have to go.

37:35.554 --> 37:39.556
I know it in my heart,

37:39.558 --> 37:41.925
And so do you.

37:51.869 --> 37:53.737
[thunder rumbling]

37:53.739 --> 37:56.573
[footsteps approach]

37:57.808 --> 38:00.677
Joe? Joe,
is that you?

38:00.679 --> 38:04.414
No, nathaniel,
it's me.

38:07.585 --> 38:08.652
You're burning up.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.820
Did you bring some medicine?

38:10.822 --> 38:13.790
You must have
some kind of infection.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.493
I'm so tired.

38:16.495 --> 38:17.827
I just...

38:17.829 --> 38:18.695
I just want to sleep.

38:18.697 --> 38:19.863
No.

38:19.865 --> 38:22.299
No, we need to get you
to a doctor.

38:22.301 --> 38:24.634
I have to get you to coal valley
while you're still conscious.

38:24.636 --> 38:25.735
No, no...

38:25.737 --> 38:27.904
Julie, I can't...

38:35.880 --> 38:37.347
Nate must've run off
with the money for himself.

38:37.349 --> 38:39.849
Or I'll tell him
you were talking like that.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.418
You do that.

38:41.420 --> 38:42.886
He must be in trouble,

38:42.888 --> 38:44.888
And we're gonna find him,

38:44.890 --> 38:46.423
Hell or high water.

38:57.735 --> 38:59.936
Before I leave,

38:59.938 --> 39:01.471
I've left a file for you

39:01.473 --> 39:02.806
On some safety violations
at the mine

39:02.808 --> 39:03.606
You should really look into.

39:03.608 --> 39:04.607
I will.

39:04.609 --> 39:05.809
Also,

39:05.811 --> 39:07.844
Abigail stanton,

39:07.846 --> 39:09.746
She can be an ally to you.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.614
She's been a confidante to me
in the matter.

39:11.616 --> 39:13.350
Understood.

39:13.352 --> 39:15.452
You have
a safe journey, now, jack.

39:16.654 --> 39:18.922
Keep this town safe, patrick.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.690
I'll be sure
to keep her safe, too.

39:21.826 --> 39:22.659
Thank you.

39:43.614 --> 39:44.681
[banging at door]

39:44.683 --> 39:45.849
[julie]: Abigail?

39:45.851 --> 39:46.750
Elizabeth! Help!

39:46.752 --> 39:48.051
Help!

39:48.053 --> 39:49.719
Julie, we've
been worried.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.588
He's bleeding
quite badly.

39:51.590 --> 39:52.956
Sir! Sir,
can you hear me?

39:52.958 --> 39:54.557
His name is nathaniel.

39:54.559 --> 39:56.860
[doctor]:
I've given him a sedative.

39:56.862 --> 39:57.961
Just let him rest.

39:57.963 --> 39:59.396
He's going to be
all right?

39:59.398 --> 40:00.997
It'll be touch and go.
He has sepsis.

40:00.999 --> 40:03.767
Lead poisoning.

40:03.769 --> 40:04.567
From the bullet?

40:04.569 --> 40:05.869
Yes.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.470
I'll be back
in the morning

40:07.472 --> 40:08.938
To see how he's doing.

40:08.940 --> 40:09.739
If he gets worse
during the night,

40:09.741 --> 40:10.940
Come for me.

40:10.942 --> 40:11.941
Yes, of course.

40:11.943 --> 40:13.510
Thank you,
dr. Higgins.

40:16.747 --> 40:18.548
This isn't adding up.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.483
Where is this
hunting partner of his?

40:20.485 --> 40:23.086
Well, I don't know.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.454
I found him in the forest.

40:24.456 --> 40:25.622
He was delirious.

40:25.624 --> 40:27.457
I barely got his name
out of him.

40:27.459 --> 40:28.725
But he was able to tell you

40:28.727 --> 40:30.693
He was injured
in a hunting accident?

40:30.695 --> 40:31.861
Yes...

40:31.863 --> 40:33.930
That's all he said.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.999
You don't believe me?

40:36.001 --> 40:37.600
Well, you have to admit,

40:37.602 --> 40:39.469
Something doesn't seem right
about this young man.

40:44.608 --> 40:45.875
[elizabeth]: I hope

40:45.877 --> 40:47.577
He doesn't turn out
to be trouble.

40:49.013 --> 40:50.680
Jack will save us.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.615
He's the hero of this story.

40:52.617 --> 40:53.683
It's not a story,

40:53.685 --> 40:56.653
It's real life with
consequences and heartbreak...

40:56.655 --> 40:57.687
[crying]

40:57.689 --> 41:00.557
What is it, sister?

41:01.892 --> 41:02.992
Jack's gone.

41:02.994 --> 41:04.527
He took a new post.

41:04.529 --> 41:05.695
He left this morning.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.897
No...

41:07.899 --> 41:10.467
[sobbing]

41:34.925 --> 41:37.560
[â™ª]
