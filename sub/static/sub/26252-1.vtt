00:43.373 --> 00:45.375
- We haven't seen
Jackson in over a year.

00:47.072 --> 00:48.160
His friends said he
went to that old hotel

00:48.204 --> 00:49.901
to look for a
souvenir or something.

00:52.473 --> 00:54.692
That was the last time
anybody ever heard from him.

01:05.529 --> 01:07.836
Every time we're about to
let go, something happens,

01:07.879 --> 01:08.880
something

01:10.138 --> 01:12.227
strange,

01:12.571 --> 01:14.616
and it just rips our hearts out.

01:16.262 --> 01:18.394
It started with text messages,

01:19.569 --> 01:22.093
randomly in the
middle of the night.

01:22.137 --> 01:24.226
I told the police and
they looked into it

01:24.270 --> 01:26.272
and they found...

01:30.276 --> 01:32.887
They found they were coming
from inside the hotel.

01:53.647 --> 01:57.128
My husband watched the
video of Jackson lost inside

01:57.172 --> 02:01.089
the hotel but I can't bring
myself to sit through it.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.442
I know he used his phone
to try and get help.

02:07.791 --> 02:11.273
Phone calls and video messages

02:11.317 --> 02:12.187
and texts.

02:18.149 --> 02:19.281
- If you get this message,

02:19.325 --> 02:21.979
please send help to
the Abaddon Hotel.

02:22.023 --> 02:24.243
I can't, there's no way out.

02:25.548 --> 02:26.288
I saw them all.

02:26.332 --> 02:28.334
They're all here.

02:28.377 --> 02:29.987
They're all still here.

02:32.120 --> 02:35.036
Please, somebody hear me!

02:35.079 --> 02:35.906
Somebody!

02:37.556 --> 02:40.036
They want me to go with them.

02:40.130 --> 02:41.479
They want me to go with them.

02:43.394 --> 02:44.917
Please!

02:44.961 --> 02:46.440
Please, someone help.

02:49.443 --> 02:50.662
They have no eyes.

03:20.788 --> 03:22.703
No one's coming for me.

03:26.577 --> 03:28.927
I'm sorry I ever came here.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.933
I don't know where
they all came from.

03:39.411 --> 03:43.110
They're all in the dining room.

03:43.154 --> 03:44.982
They're all in Hell.

03:47.158 --> 03:48.420
They're all with him.

03:51.728 --> 03:53.251
Mom, I'm sorry...

03:55.122 --> 03:58.343
- About two weeks
later I got an email

03:58.387 --> 03:59.475
from Jackson's account,

04:02.303 --> 04:03.522
I didn't wanna open it.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.221
I mean, I knew it couldn't
be from him, right?

04:07.265 --> 04:08.005
I opened it.

04:10.877 --> 04:12.401
And I watched the video.

04:14.315 --> 04:17.754
Oh, my God.

04:17.797 --> 04:19.059
God, I wish I hadn't.

04:24.369 --> 04:26.110
It was an empty room

04:30.767 --> 04:33.334
and then I could hear
Jackson's screams.

04:35.946 --> 04:37.208
And there was something else,

04:37.251 --> 04:40.603
there was this piano
playing somewhere

04:42.343 --> 04:44.215
and I knew immediately I'd
heard that tune before.

04:44.258 --> 04:46.173
It was so familiar.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.092
- Please!

04:52.136 --> 04:54.225
Please, somebody!

04:54.268 --> 04:55.879
Somebody help me!

04:55.922 --> 04:56.662
Please!

05:02.494 --> 05:04.757
- We've heard that
piano tune before

05:04.801 --> 05:06.846
in the Hell House documentary,

05:06.890 --> 05:09.414
but when the Mallet's say
that they've heard it,

05:09.458 --> 05:12.896
they're referring to
long before Hell House.

05:12.939 --> 05:14.506
- Orca.
- Go Fish.

05:14.550 --> 05:16.334
- Anyone got an orca?

05:16.377 --> 05:18.075
- I got one.
- I got an orca.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.555
- Orca.
- Okay, thank you.

05:19.598 --> 05:22.079
- Hey, I saw you,
you're cheating!

05:22.122 --> 05:24.168
- I'm not cheating!
- Hey, hey, hey.

05:24.211 --> 05:25.691
- Mom!
- Mom, are you getting this?

05:25.735 --> 05:27.998
- Guys, calm down,
Jackson's asleep, come on.

05:28.041 --> 05:30.261
- Oh, my God.
- So unfair.

05:31.088 --> 05:32.306
- Play nicely, come on.

05:32.350 --> 05:34.004
- Got a fish?
- Got a crab?

05:35.048 --> 05:36.485
- Carlie, do you have a crab?

05:36.528 --> 05:39.096
- Hey guys, do you hear that?

05:39.139 --> 05:40.445
Where's that coming from?

05:59.420 --> 06:01.510
- Jackson, I
thought you were in bed.

06:03.033 --> 06:05.775
- The hotel opens
in 2009, tell everyone.

06:06.732 --> 06:08.255
- What, what hotel?

06:10.431 --> 06:11.302
- Who turned
out the lights?

06:19.440 --> 06:21.530
- Hey,
Jackson, are you okay?

06:21.573 --> 06:23.096
- Yeah.

06:23.140 --> 06:25.272
- Are you sure,
what were you talking about?

06:25.316 --> 06:26.883
- Nothing, I didn't
say anything.

06:29.059 --> 06:30.800
- Later on, and I played it back

06:30.843 --> 06:32.453
with my husband, we heard it.

06:34.586 --> 06:36.893
There's another
voice in that room.

06:38.459 --> 06:39.373
It's almost,

06:41.375 --> 06:43.290
almost like it could
hear my question

06:43.334 --> 06:45.597
and was telling
Jackson what to say.

06:50.167 --> 06:51.037
- Who turned
out the lights?

06:51.081 --> 06:52.473
- The Abaddon Hotel.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.610
- This hotel has a
long history of eerie

06:58.654 --> 07:02.179
and unexplained events
being caught on camera.

07:02.222 --> 07:06.139
Even our own cameras weren't
immune to catching something

07:06.183 --> 07:09.360
spooky when we rehearsed
this very segment.

07:10.448 --> 07:12.189
Okay, am I close in enough?

07:13.016 --> 07:13.886
How's my frame?

07:15.627 --> 07:16.410
Good?

07:17.542 --> 07:18.543
Gary, what?

07:43.612 --> 07:46.440
It's been two years since
the controversial release

07:46.484 --> 07:48.355
of the Hell House documentary

07:48.399 --> 07:50.401
and many of us still
have questions.

07:50.444 --> 07:52.925
The biggest question
on everyone's mind,

07:52.969 --> 07:55.536
was it real or was
it an elaborate hoax

07:55.580 --> 07:58.148
planned by the documentarians
to sell the film?

07:58.191 --> 08:01.542
Here today we have a full
panel to discuss this question.

08:01.586 --> 08:03.632
Arnold Tasselman, who worked
for the Rockland County

08:03.675 --> 08:06.939
Magistrate's Office at the
time of the Hell House incident

08:06.983 --> 08:10.073
seven years ago and
Mitchell Cavanaugh,

08:10.116 --> 08:12.466
the Mitchell Cavanaugh
from the documentary,

08:12.510 --> 08:15.687
allegedly the only surviving
member of the film.

08:15.731 --> 08:17.297
We'll get into that.

08:17.341 --> 08:20.474
And lastly, we have Brock
Davies, a medium and psychic

08:20.518 --> 08:22.389
who you may know from
his work on several

08:22.433 --> 08:26.132
missing persons cases that
gained nation-wide attention.

08:26.176 --> 08:27.438
- Thanks for having me on, Suzy.

08:27.481 --> 08:30.223
Somehow I knew you'd call.

08:30.267 --> 08:33.270
Be sure to check out
Brock Davies From Beyond,

08:33.313 --> 08:35.446
coming next fall to--
- Thank you, Brock.

08:36.621 --> 08:38.754
So, why don't we start--
- Suzy, do you mind

08:38.797 --> 08:40.885
if I start with a
comment and a question?

08:41.974 --> 08:42.975
- Sure.
- Thanks.

08:43.019 --> 08:44.063
- You're a dick.

08:45.282 --> 08:47.719
Comment, and my
question is, why?

08:47.763 --> 08:49.199
Look at this.
- Camera's up.

08:52.202 --> 08:53.725
- Who is that?

08:53.769 --> 08:55.858
- That's Mitchell Cavanaugh
from the Hell House documentary.

08:55.901 --> 08:58.164
That's who we need to
get us into the Abaddon.

08:58.208 --> 09:00.863
- Well, from what we saw,
getting in isn't the problem,

09:00.906 --> 09:02.342
it's finding our
way to the basement

09:02.386 --> 09:04.388
and finding our way out.
- Well, exactly.

09:04.431 --> 09:05.911
He edited all the
Hell House footage,

09:05.955 --> 09:08.566
he must know the
hotel inside out.

09:08.609 --> 09:09.610
- Maybe.

09:11.482 --> 09:13.789
- Arnold here has
served me with a lawsuit

09:13.832 --> 09:17.053
trying to get my film off the
market so no one can see it.

09:17.096 --> 09:18.619
- Mr. Tasselman,

09:18.663 --> 09:20.578
can you discuss the
lawsuit against Mitchell?

09:20.621 --> 09:24.103
- I'm not able to discuss
details about pending litigation

09:24.147 --> 09:27.324
but what I can tell you
is that his fake movie

09:27.367 --> 09:29.587
has caused harm to
the town of Abaddon.

09:29.630 --> 09:32.198
- Cold cases in old hotels
is not really our thing,

09:32.242 --> 09:34.244
we put a state Senator in jail!

09:35.462 --> 09:36.725
Yeah, and that was
a really good thing

09:36.768 --> 09:38.814
but now they're saying
this place is haunted.

09:38.857 --> 09:41.468
- Oh, come on, Molly, don't
tell me you believe in ghosts.

09:41.512 --> 09:44.080
Look, we're going to the
Abaddon, that's final.

09:44.123 --> 09:45.559
You two track down
Mitchell today

09:45.603 --> 09:47.431
and get him to meet me.

09:47.474 --> 09:49.259
- Got ya.
- What are you doing?

09:49.302 --> 09:51.130
- I'm calling into this show.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.437
This guy is such a fucking liar.

09:55.482 --> 09:57.484
- Hell House was a tragedy

09:57.528 --> 09:59.791
and we still mourn
the loss of life.

09:59.835 --> 10:02.402
What I'm talking about is
faking everything about

10:02.446 --> 10:06.363
the hotel's owner, the
supposed Hell House tapes.

10:06.406 --> 10:09.061
Putting that quack author
Robert Lyons on camera,

10:09.105 --> 10:11.107
faking a full scene
with your own crew

10:11.150 --> 10:12.673
in a room where you
knew that people--

10:12.717 --> 10:15.415
- You're talking
about Diane Graves,

10:15.459 --> 10:17.940
the missing documentarian
who was last seen

10:17.983 --> 10:20.116
on her own video
inside the hotel.

10:20.159 --> 10:22.596
- That is exactly what
I am talking about.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.469
- Excuse me, Diane is dead.

10:25.512 --> 10:27.384
Okay, Johnathan is dead.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.560
They died inside that
hotel.

10:29.603 --> 10:31.431
- Can we not use that word?
- I'm sorry.

10:31.475 --> 10:34.043
- Please, everyone
knows that no one died

10:34.086 --> 10:36.567
outside of the
Halloween malfunction.

10:36.610 --> 10:38.656
- You're still going
with malfunction,

10:38.699 --> 10:41.833
like a prop fell from the
ceiling and killed 15 people?

10:41.877 --> 10:44.749
- I'd actually like to
jump in on that point.

10:44.793 --> 10:47.708
I, too, would like to
know how the police

10:47.752 --> 10:50.668
arrived at calling
it a malfunction?

10:50.711 --> 10:53.236
- The details of that
night are still not allowed

10:53.279 --> 10:56.761
to be discussed publicly.
- Of course.

10:56.805 --> 10:59.808
- But, from everything
that I've seen,

10:59.851 --> 11:03.420
I can guarantee the public
that the hotel is safe

11:03.463 --> 11:06.727
and is not responsible in
any way for the tragedy

11:06.771 --> 11:09.252
nor anything else that people
are alleging happened since.

11:09.295 --> 11:11.863
- If it's so safe,
why does the town keep

11:11.907 --> 11:14.300
police cars outside
at all times,

11:14.344 --> 11:16.128
making sure no one goes in?

11:16.172 --> 11:17.738
- We were
here like yesterday

11:17.782 --> 11:20.654
while you guys were off
filming that goofy TV thing

11:20.698 --> 11:24.963
and we deduced that there
was a 10 minute window

11:25.007 --> 11:26.225
and we can get it.

11:27.661 --> 11:29.968
Badass, right?
- Why do they guard it so much

11:30.012 --> 11:31.752
if they're saying there's
nothing wrong with it?

11:31.796 --> 11:33.885
- Yeah, man, like--
- Well, it's not just

11:33.929 --> 11:36.583
the Hell House incident
or Diane, there are also

11:36.627 --> 11:40.152
two teenagers from the nearby
area that have disappeared.

11:40.196 --> 11:43.634
- And people think that has
something to do with the hotel?

11:43.677 --> 11:46.463
- Well, of course anything
could have happened to them

11:46.506 --> 11:50.597
but, one poor kid streamed
himself on Facebook

11:50.641 --> 11:52.643
while breaking in and it was
the last time he was ever seen.

11:52.686 --> 11:54.775
- Are you serious,
when did that happen?

11:54.819 --> 11:57.517
- I mean, I'm sure
Jessica knows all of this.

11:57.561 --> 11:59.911
- Dude, she doesn't
even believe in ghosts.

12:01.173 --> 12:03.654
- Neither did Diane.
- I'd like to point out,

12:03.697 --> 12:06.439
and I think it's important
to clarify for the audience,

12:06.483 --> 12:10.226
that these poor individuals
who have gone missing

12:10.269 --> 12:12.750
were amateur ghost
hunters, these were not

12:12.793 --> 12:15.927
trained professional
paranormal investigators.

12:15.971 --> 12:18.495
- Thank you, Brock,
and let's go ahead

12:18.538 --> 12:20.627
and show our viewers
the Facebook Live video

12:20.671 --> 12:22.499
for those who
haven't yet seen it.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.326
Go ahead.

12:28.635 --> 12:29.854
- All right.

12:29.898 --> 12:31.900
It looks like nobody's
here right now.

12:33.945 --> 12:35.120
Should be able to get in and out

12:35.164 --> 12:37.296
without being seen, all right.

12:40.909 --> 12:43.520
To my fans, love
you all very much,

12:43.563 --> 12:44.825
I told you I would do this.

12:44.869 --> 12:46.653
Yeet, eh?

12:46.697 --> 12:47.480
All right.

12:49.178 --> 12:51.136
You can just check
out my channel,

12:51.180 --> 12:54.487
the old warehouse video, all
kinds of stuff like that.

12:54.531 --> 12:56.707
The abandoned mineshaft
just two weeks ago.

12:58.752 --> 12:59.753
All right.

13:02.843 --> 13:06.108
No, Rachel, I actually, I'm
wearing boxer briefs right now.

13:14.029 --> 13:15.204
I'm not stopping.

13:16.683 --> 13:18.337
You've just gotta
admit that was,

13:19.469 --> 13:22.254
that was pretty weird.

13:22.298 --> 13:23.081
All right.

13:28.869 --> 13:30.784
Not taking any chances.

13:33.831 --> 13:34.875
Here we go.

14:01.424 --> 14:02.729
I'm sorry,

14:02.773 --> 14:03.774
I'll go now.

14:21.052 --> 14:24.186
- What's strange about
that video is that

14:24.229 --> 14:27.841
it never cut, it kept on
streaming through the night

14:27.885 --> 14:30.844
in that exact position
until the phone's battery

14:30.888 --> 14:32.455
ran out at dusk.

14:40.854 --> 14:44.119
Police arrived later
that day at the pleading

14:44.162 --> 14:46.034
from friends and
family of Cameron,

14:46.077 --> 14:48.427
but they were not
able to find a thing,

14:48.471 --> 14:50.908
not a trace of Cameron.
- Well, I'm sorry.

14:50.951 --> 14:54.129
This video doesn't show
anything happening to Cameron.

14:54.172 --> 14:55.695
I think you want people to think

14:55.739 --> 14:56.957
there's something
dangerous inside

14:57.001 --> 14:58.959
so that you can sell more DVDs.

14:59.003 --> 15:01.658
All you've done is
given this kid the idea

15:01.701 --> 15:02.963
to sneak into private property.

15:03.007 --> 15:04.704
- Try to prove it's all a hoax.

15:05.531 --> 15:07.055
Prove it.

15:07.098 --> 15:10.232
There's just too much you
can't explain and you know it.

15:10.275 --> 15:11.624
Like where the hell do you think

15:11.668 --> 15:13.626
I've been hiding
Diane all these years?

15:14.845 --> 15:17.021
Where, I just kept
her in my basement?

15:17.065 --> 15:18.109
She has family.

15:19.458 --> 15:21.025
Do you really think
she would abandon them

15:21.069 --> 15:23.680
just to sell her documentary?
- Well, I have to ask then,

15:23.723 --> 15:26.335
Arnold, if you do think
everything was a hoax,

15:26.378 --> 15:28.511
what do you conclude
happened to those people

15:28.554 --> 15:30.904
who died on opening
night at Hell House?

15:30.948 --> 15:34.734
- Well, we know that Alex
probably killed himself,

15:34.778 --> 15:38.260
Tony was in the basement
and was probably killed

15:38.303 --> 15:40.436
during the mass panic
to get out after

15:40.479 --> 15:42.873
the malfunction of some sort.

15:44.309 --> 15:48.444
If this Mack were as
smart as he claimed to be,

15:49.706 --> 15:51.490
then he would've
killed himself too

15:51.534 --> 15:55.146
because he was gonna wake
up to a pile of lawsuits

15:55.190 --> 15:57.366
for negligent homicide.

15:57.409 --> 16:02.414
We know now that Sarah was the
smart one, she disappeared.

16:03.937 --> 16:06.331
- Sarah wasn't afraid of
lawsuits, she wasn't even...

16:12.032 --> 16:13.077
She

16:14.687 --> 16:16.994
used Diane.
- How do you mean?

16:18.213 --> 16:19.692
- Look, everything
about the hotel

16:19.736 --> 16:21.346
goes back to Andrew Tully.

16:21.390 --> 16:24.175
- Andrew Tully, the hotel's
owner who was accused

16:24.219 --> 16:27.787
of performing Satanic rituals
in the basement and also

16:27.831 --> 16:31.313
accused of being involved with
some guest disappearances.

16:31.356 --> 16:34.272
- Yeah, the problem is
Andrew Tully is dead.

16:36.579 --> 16:40.104
He hanged himself after the
hotel closed back in the 80s.

16:40.148 --> 16:43.020
None, none of the
evil cult activity

16:43.063 --> 16:44.717
was actually ever proven.

16:49.157 --> 16:50.636
- Well when
should I ask my question?

16:50.680 --> 16:52.943
- Wait until you
hear me bring up the basement.

16:52.986 --> 16:55.032
- So you'll say,
"It's in the basement."

16:55.075 --> 16:57.991
And I'll ask something
like, "How do you know

16:58.035 --> 17:00.429
"that it's in the basement?"
- Right.

17:02.735 --> 17:04.040
On me.

17:04.084 --> 17:06.521
Hi, I'm Jessica Fox,
it's October seventh

17:06.565 --> 17:08.872
and I'm here with Molly Reynolds

17:08.915 --> 17:10.002
and David Morris.
- Yo.

17:10.047 --> 17:12.657
- And with us is
Mitchell Cavanaugh.

17:12.702 --> 17:16.488
- What are you guys, some sort
of an investigative outfit?

17:16.531 --> 17:18.925
Like a boutique
Vice or 60 Minutes?

17:18.969 --> 17:22.451
- Yeah, but unlike other
journalists, we film every part

17:22.493 --> 17:24.974
of our story from inception
through publication.

17:25.018 --> 17:26.541
And we're totally transparent,

17:26.585 --> 17:28.195
everything is released
once we publish.

17:28.239 --> 17:30.328
- Jess has
me record everything,

17:30.372 --> 17:31.634
I don't stop rolling.

17:31.677 --> 17:33.723
I go to the can,
this goes with me.

17:33.766 --> 17:35.725
- That's
great but I...

17:46.388 --> 17:48.694
- The hotel is like
a maze and of course

17:48.738 --> 17:51.001
that's not by accident,
Tully designed it

17:51.044 --> 17:54.091
based on H.H. Holmes'
murder house, I've heard.

17:54.134 --> 17:56.528
So he made it as hard as
possible to find your way out

17:56.572 --> 17:57.834
in the middle of the night.

17:57.877 --> 18:00.010
And we need to find our
way to the basement.

18:00.053 --> 18:02.752
- But how do you know
what we're looking for

18:02.795 --> 18:05.015
is in the basement?
- That's a good question,

18:05.058 --> 18:07.931
Molly, everything that Tully
wanted to keep a secret

18:07.974 --> 18:10.150
was kept in the basement,
so we're talking about

18:10.194 --> 18:13.545
proof of cult activity
and information about

18:13.589 --> 18:15.199
the missing guests,
it's all there.

18:15.243 --> 18:18.071
- You had no proof when
you called into the show,

18:18.115 --> 18:21.336
you just knew how to find it?

18:21.379 --> 18:25.209
And that's what you
needed me for, right?

18:25.253 --> 18:26.819
- Right.

18:26.863 --> 18:30.649
- How do you even know that
this supposed evidence exists?

18:30.693 --> 18:32.303
- Because of one
flipped witness.

18:32.347 --> 18:34.436
That's all it took and
I have the transcript.

18:34.479 --> 18:36.264
- Who flipped and
why don't we know about it?

18:36.307 --> 18:39.136
- Because once Tully
and his cult members

18:39.179 --> 18:41.007
committed suicide, the
whole thing got dropped,

18:41.051 --> 18:42.705
everything, it just disappeared.

18:42.748 --> 18:44.576
But this guy,

18:44.620 --> 18:46.056
Patrick Carmichael,

18:46.099 --> 18:49.581
he worked at the hotel, he
was a member of Tully's cult

18:49.625 --> 18:51.322
but he was arrested on a
separate assault charge

18:51.366 --> 18:53.411
so he missed the suicide party.

18:53.455 --> 18:54.369
He says

18:55.370 --> 18:58.024
that Tully kept video footage

18:58.068 --> 19:00.505
and photos of what was
happening at the hotel.

19:00.549 --> 19:04.117
And then here, he says it
was kept in the fridges.

19:04.161 --> 19:05.118
- What fridges?

19:05.162 --> 19:07.164
Nobody searched the fridges?

19:07.207 --> 19:10.298
- Yes but what if they assumed
he meant the kitchen fridges?

19:10.341 --> 19:12.430
- The cops only searched
the kitchen fridges

19:12.474 --> 19:13.692
but not the one in the basement

19:13.736 --> 19:16.652
which I think, with
all due respect,

19:16.695 --> 19:19.002
it is a ridiculous theory.

19:19.045 --> 19:21.265
- We're dealing with a police
force that hasn't been able

19:21.309 --> 19:23.398
to solve a series
of disappearances

19:23.441 --> 19:25.095
for decades in the same place.

19:25.138 --> 19:27.315
- Okay, so what is the plan?

19:27.358 --> 19:31.057
We go into the basement,
search the fridge

19:31.101 --> 19:33.451
and find the evidence.
- Yes.

19:33.495 --> 19:35.061
I don't believe in ghost stories

19:35.105 --> 19:36.802
but I don't wanna take
any chances with you guys,

19:36.846 --> 19:39.065
we're gonna be in and
out in an hour, tops.

19:39.109 --> 19:41.329
If Mitchell is with us,
we'll be even quicker

19:41.372 --> 19:43.722
because he knows the
hotel better than anyone.

19:45.333 --> 19:48.423
- That's a really fucked up
place to try to break into.

19:48.466 --> 19:50.816
You know that, right?
- Yes.

19:50.860 --> 19:51.861
Mitchell, we
absolutely know that.

19:51.904 --> 19:53.515
The evidence is there.

19:54.429 --> 19:57.301
I know it, it has to be.

19:57.345 --> 19:59.129
Okay, and if we
find it then maybe

19:59.172 --> 20:01.174
we will find out what
happened to Diane.

20:02.001 --> 20:02.785
Finally.

20:04.656 --> 20:05.701
Don't you wanna know?

20:12.447 --> 20:13.970
We can't do this without you.

20:18.104 --> 20:20.542
- Will you turn
that off, please?

20:20.585 --> 20:23.153
- Jess?
- Yep, turn it off.

20:23.196 --> 20:24.415
- I'd like to share
with our audience

20:24.459 --> 20:27.592
some of the stranger
unexplained occurrences

20:27.636 --> 20:30.987
that have been recorded
since the documentary aired

20:31.030 --> 20:33.381
in what many refer to as
the Hell House fallout.

20:33.424 --> 20:36.253
- So people believe
that this stuff is real?

20:36.296 --> 20:39.082
- Well, nothing's been
proven either way yet.

20:39.125 --> 20:42.433
- Look, as long as that
hotel emits this kinetic

20:42.477 --> 20:45.305
spiritual energy, people
are going to continue

20:45.349 --> 20:47.395
to be drawn to it,
which is precisely why

20:47.438 --> 20:50.659
someone like me is invaluable
to the investigation.

20:50.702 --> 20:53.096
I need to be allowed
in that hotel.

20:53.139 --> 20:54.706
I need access to it.

20:54.750 --> 20:57.753
- Let's hold off on commenting
until we've seen the footage.

20:57.796 --> 20:58.536
Go ahead.

21:10.592 --> 21:13.290
- All right, Ben,
challenge accepted.

21:13.333 --> 21:14.247
I'm goin' in.

21:15.335 --> 21:17.947
All right, coast
is clear, no cops.

21:23.169 --> 21:23.953
Holy shit.

21:58.814 --> 22:01.817
All right, I think
that's far enough.

22:01.860 --> 22:02.992
Challenge completed.

22:08.388 --> 22:09.389
Get ready to pay up, Ben.

22:20.444 --> 22:21.619
Holy shit.

22:21.663 --> 22:22.664
- I haven't
seen Paul around

22:22.707 --> 22:25.362
in a few days, is he okay?

22:25.405 --> 22:27.016
- Holy shit.

22:37.853 --> 22:39.332
Oh shit!

22:43.946 --> 22:47.384
- Hey guys, so we just got
back from our fashion show,

22:47.427 --> 22:48.298
was kinda disappointed

22:49.517 --> 22:51.040
we came from such
a faraway place

22:51.083 --> 22:53.216
just to see a thrift shop.

22:53.259 --> 22:55.740
I was expecting some
sort of high end

22:55.784 --> 22:58.526
awesome, amazing fashion line.
- Hey, Nate, sorry.

22:59.483 --> 23:01.006
Is that girl hitchhiking?

23:01.050 --> 23:02.486
- Babe who hitchhikes anymore?
- I don't know, come on,

23:02.530 --> 23:04.880
it's so shitty out,
let's pick her up.

23:04.923 --> 23:05.968
- Fine, okay, fine.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.368
Honey, do you need a ride?

23:17.370 --> 23:18.589
Do you think we should do this?

23:18.633 --> 23:21.331
- Yeah, it too cold out.
- Come on, she might--

23:21.374 --> 23:22.201
- Oh, hey.

23:23.507 --> 23:24.552
- Hi, sweetie.

23:24.595 --> 23:25.770
- How's it going?

23:27.467 --> 23:28.904
- Where you
headed sweetie?

23:28.947 --> 23:30.383
- The Abaddon Hotel.

23:31.428 --> 23:33.561
- The Abaddon Hotel, honey,

23:33.604 --> 23:35.998
that place has been closed
for a few years now.

23:37.260 --> 23:38.696
- I checked in already.

23:40.655 --> 23:42.265
- Okay, when did you check in?

23:43.483 --> 23:44.572
- October eighth.

23:46.225 --> 23:48.097
- It's September 30th.

23:49.359 --> 23:50.621
- Let's just
get her home, okay?

23:51.666 --> 23:52.667
- Fine, we're going.

23:55.191 --> 23:56.584
- I'm sorry,
are you okay?

23:56.627 --> 23:57.846
You just, you look
a little pale.

23:57.889 --> 24:00.544
Do you need some
water or something?

24:02.938 --> 24:04.200
- Not so talkative, huh?

24:05.723 --> 24:07.203
I guess I wouldn't be
either if I was stuck

24:07.246 --> 24:08.944
on the side of the
road in the cold.

24:15.515 --> 24:17.909
I think this is it.
- It's all boarded up.

24:17.953 --> 24:20.042
- I know, this
doesn't look right.

24:20.085 --> 24:22.131
- Miss, is this where
you wanted us to drop you?

24:22.174 --> 24:23.654
- Does this place
look familiar to you?

24:23.698 --> 24:24.568
- Hold on, miss.
- Hold on, wait,

24:24.612 --> 24:26.091
please don't get out of the car!

24:26.135 --> 24:26.962
- This place is
boarded up, I'm not letting

24:27.005 --> 24:28.050
her go in there.
- I know!

24:28.093 --> 24:29.094
- Hold on.
- Babe, wait, hold on.

24:29.138 --> 24:29.921
- Miss?

24:32.837 --> 24:34.926
Miss, do you need some
help or something?

24:35.797 --> 24:37.276
She went in.

24:37.320 --> 24:39.975
- Adam, I don't like this.
- I know, come on.

24:40.018 --> 24:41.324
- I don't think
she knows where she is.

24:41.367 --> 24:43.456
- I know, she's...

24:43.500 --> 24:44.632
- Sweetie?
- Hello?

24:46.329 --> 24:48.984
Do you have a
flashlight or something?

24:49.027 --> 24:50.681
- Yeah.
- On your phone?

24:50.725 --> 24:51.508
- Hello?

24:53.292 --> 24:54.772
- Oh, there she
is, honey, can you?

24:56.034 --> 24:57.253
- Adam, I don't think she--
- It's fine.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.255
- I don't think this is her--
- Hold on.

24:59.298 --> 25:00.082
Miss?

25:02.084 --> 25:03.520
Hello?

25:03.563 --> 25:05.653
- Sweetie,
we just wanna help.

25:09.569 --> 25:10.745
Oh my god.

25:10.788 --> 25:11.615
- Miss.

25:13.399 --> 25:14.531
- Adam, I
don't think we need

25:14.574 --> 25:16.098
to be here anymore.
- It's okay.

25:16.141 --> 25:17.142
There's something
wrong with her.

25:17.186 --> 25:18.100
Honey?
- I know, it's not--

25:18.143 --> 25:19.405
- Listen!
- Worth it.

25:19.449 --> 25:20.668
- You shouldn't
be down here, okay?

25:20.711 --> 25:23.453
Just come up with us
and we'll help you,

25:23.496 --> 25:25.716
whatever you need, okay?
- So cold in here.

25:26.717 --> 25:28.110
- Oh fuck!
- Oh my god.

25:28.153 --> 25:29.024
- Get outta here, go!
- Adam!

25:29.067 --> 25:31.548
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!

26:15.244 --> 26:16.593
- And like, you've...

26:18.203 --> 26:21.250
And so because I like him,
now I'm okay with the tattoos.

26:21.293 --> 26:23.252
- You say this like
it's an accomplishment.

26:23.295 --> 26:25.515
It's like, "Oh, I've never
dated a werewolf before."

26:25.558 --> 26:30.085
- No, I used to hate
them and now I don't.

26:30.128 --> 26:32.914
- She comes from the town
from the movie Footloose,

26:32.957 --> 26:34.002
it's real.
- Well...

26:35.830 --> 26:37.832
- We go to meet
her parents, right?

26:37.875 --> 26:40.878
And she grabs me and she's
like, "Just don't dance."

26:40.922 --> 26:42.358
- I did not say that!
- Wait, what?

26:42.401 --> 26:43.620
What did she say?
- No dancing.

26:43.663 --> 26:45.230
- I said nothing
to do with dance.

26:45.274 --> 26:47.537
I said, "Don't be weird."

26:48.930 --> 26:50.801
- Is that better?
- You can always be weird

26:50.845 --> 26:52.368
in front of me.
- Okay.

26:52.411 --> 26:54.587
- But in front of my parents?
- I feel a bout of weird.

26:54.631 --> 26:56.328
- Oh no.
- Coming on, the dance floor.

26:56.372 --> 26:57.721
- Oh god.

26:57.765 --> 26:59.027
- Well, it's okay.
- Dance Commander coming out.

26:59.070 --> 27:00.463
- Command that.
- This is really happening.

27:00.506 --> 27:02.030
- I know, yes.
- Jess, you can do

27:02.073 --> 27:03.640
whatever you want with
that because I don't care.

27:03.683 --> 27:05.555
- Oh, I'm not turning it off.

27:05.598 --> 27:07.383
I'm gonna use this.
- I don't work 'til tomorrow.

27:07.426 --> 27:08.297
- Uh-huh.

27:08.340 --> 27:09.646
You're gonna regret this.

27:33.975 --> 27:34.802
You okay?

27:35.803 --> 27:37.761
- What, yeah, yeah.

27:37.805 --> 27:38.980
- You look kinda sad.

27:40.895 --> 27:41.634
- Nah, I'm fine.

27:43.071 --> 27:44.899
What are you hoping
to get outta this?

27:44.942 --> 27:46.683
What, are you just
looking to get

27:46.726 --> 27:48.859
your niche company on the map?

27:48.903 --> 27:50.513
- Oh, I think we're
already on the map.

27:50.556 --> 27:52.080
- Oh, pardon me.

27:52.123 --> 27:53.733
- But this,

27:53.777 --> 27:57.476
this story, if I'm
honest, is like the most

27:57.520 --> 27:59.870
interesting thing that's come
across my desk in a long time.

27:59.914 --> 28:01.176
- Otherwise you
wouldn't be out here

28:01.219 --> 28:03.961
in the middle of nowhere
trying to sneak into a

28:04.005 --> 28:06.746
rumored haunted hotel.
- Mm-hmm.

28:06.790 --> 28:08.748
Can I ask you something?

28:08.792 --> 28:09.706
- Yeah, sure, shoot.

28:11.099 --> 28:14.015
- What do you think really
happened to Sarah Happle?

28:14.058 --> 28:17.801
I mean, you don't think you
interviewed a dead girl, right?

28:17.845 --> 28:19.585
You can't believe that.

28:22.284 --> 28:25.722
- Let me answer that one for
you some other time when,

28:25.765 --> 28:28.029
when the camera's not on me.
- Oh, I can turn it off.

28:28.072 --> 28:29.378
- Nah.

28:29.421 --> 28:32.163
What, and miss this,
are you kidding me?

28:33.208 --> 28:35.253
- Oh no, oh no, it's begun.

28:38.648 --> 28:41.651
Wait, what do you think of
Brock Davies coming with us?

28:42.870 --> 28:44.349
- I'm not thrilled by the idea.

28:44.393 --> 28:47.352
Wait, how does he even
know that we're doing this?

28:47.396 --> 28:49.398
I told him after the talk
show that there was no way

28:49.441 --> 28:50.616
I was gonna go back
to the Abaddon.

28:50.660 --> 28:52.444
- Okay, it's Brock,
he knows shit.

28:52.488 --> 28:53.706
- But it's--
- It's weird.

28:53.750 --> 28:55.056
- No, it's a bad
idea is what it is.

28:55.099 --> 28:57.797
- Okay, well, I told him
that, I said it's not--

28:57.841 --> 28:59.669
- And?
- Guess what he said.

29:00.975 --> 29:02.759
Do your best.
- Yeah, if you're looking

29:02.802 --> 29:05.675
for the secrets that
only ghosts keep,

29:05.718 --> 29:08.156
you need Brock Davies.
- Of course.

29:08.199 --> 29:09.548
- Look, what doesn't
seem to be sinking in

29:09.592 --> 29:11.594
with you or Brock is that

29:12.856 --> 29:13.857
this is dangerous.

29:15.293 --> 29:18.253
The hotel is, look at me,
the hotel is dangerous.

29:18.296 --> 29:19.950
We have to be in and
out, we don't have time,

29:19.994 --> 29:21.865
we can't wait for
Brock to be filming

29:21.909 --> 29:24.085
his newest reality show.
- I hear you,

29:24.128 --> 29:25.956
I agree, I told him that.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.653
- Okay, but do you believe it?

29:28.916 --> 29:30.700
- I have to see things
to believe them.

29:34.704 --> 29:35.748
- Well let's hope

29:37.576 --> 29:39.622
that you'll still be a
skeptic at the end of this.

29:39.665 --> 29:41.145
- We're back!

29:41.189 --> 29:42.799
- Guys, I was roofied.

29:42.842 --> 29:44.714
- You what?
- No he was not!

29:44.757 --> 29:47.021
- By Molly?
- No, no.

29:47.064 --> 29:48.674
- Doing shots, wow.
- She's taking advantage

29:48.718 --> 29:50.720
of you.
- Moved onto shots, guys.

29:50.763 --> 29:52.896
- He got some shots.
- That's terrifying.

30:09.130 --> 30:11.306
- Camera's up.
- Got spare batteries?

30:11.349 --> 30:12.872
- Absolutely.
- Cards?

30:12.916 --> 30:14.744
- Plenty.
- Are they clean?

30:14.787 --> 30:16.876
- They are
free of adult content.

30:16.920 --> 30:18.443
- All right, just
keep the camera steady.

30:18.487 --> 30:19.270
- Got ya.

30:21.229 --> 30:22.708
All right, tough guy,
what's the likelihood

30:22.752 --> 30:24.928
of us actually
getting in the back?

30:24.972 --> 30:26.712
- Well, that's the best way in.

30:26.756 --> 30:28.714
I know my way to
everywhere from there.

30:28.758 --> 30:30.890
I'll break that door down before
I look for an alternative.

30:30.934 --> 30:32.153
- See, tough guy.

30:32.196 --> 30:36.200
- Plus, nobody will
be able to see us

30:36.244 --> 30:38.028
when we're in the back, right?
- Right.

30:38.072 --> 30:40.204
- Yeah.
- Right.

30:40.248 --> 30:41.379
- Molly, are you okay?

30:44.034 --> 30:47.995
- I don't like going into
any Halloween haunted houses

30:49.257 --> 30:52.477
let alone ones that have been
abandoned for seven years.

30:52.521 --> 30:54.740
- Well if you're
uncomfortable right now,

30:54.784 --> 30:56.220
how are you gonna do inside?

31:00.659 --> 31:02.226
- I'll be okay.

31:03.836 --> 31:06.665
- Look, actually, Molly,
we need someone out here

31:06.709 --> 31:09.842
to keep an eye on things.
- No, no, I will be fine

31:09.886 --> 31:11.844
in there, I'm just--
- But one of us,

31:11.888 --> 31:13.672
one of us needs to do
it, if the cops come

31:13.716 --> 31:15.805
we need to know where
they are, when they are,

31:15.848 --> 31:18.503
so it's, we need you out here.

31:18.547 --> 31:20.288
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.

31:20.331 --> 31:22.072
We need someone.
- Yeah, but it's 8:15

31:22.116 --> 31:23.856
and we gotta go because the
next shift is on its way.

31:23.900 --> 31:25.075
- Okay.
- You got this?

31:25.119 --> 31:26.511
- If you
think it's best, yeah.

31:26.555 --> 31:28.687
- We're on the walkies, okay?
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

31:28.731 --> 31:30.907
- Look, we're
gonna be fine, okay?

31:30.950 --> 31:32.387
Like it's gonna
be an hour, tops,

31:32.430 --> 31:33.866
we're gonna steal us
some Abaddon goodies,

31:33.910 --> 31:36.391
we're gonna shoot right
back out here to you.

31:36.434 --> 31:37.870
- Come on, man, let's move it.
- All right, I'm comin'.

31:37.914 --> 31:38.697
Bossy.

31:40.351 --> 31:41.396
- Be careful.

31:50.013 --> 31:51.797
- No dicking around, understand?

31:51.841 --> 31:53.799
- Completely agree.

31:53.843 --> 31:57.847
- If I say drop whatever you're
doing and head for the exit,

31:57.890 --> 31:59.762
you do exactly that.

31:59.805 --> 32:01.024
- We're on the same page.
- Do you think that

32:01.068 --> 32:02.591
we're gonna have a problem?
- No, no, no.

32:02.634 --> 32:04.723
He's just saying that
on the off chance

32:04.767 --> 32:06.247
that something goes
wrong, it's fine.

32:14.733 --> 32:15.865
- If we're in any
kind of danger,

32:15.908 --> 32:17.258
you drop the camera and run.

32:18.824 --> 32:21.653
- No, no, no, we're not a
drop the camera and run group,

32:21.697 --> 32:23.699
we get everything, the
camera never goes off,

32:23.742 --> 32:25.048
that is non negotiable.

32:27.137 --> 32:28.704
- Fine.

32:28.747 --> 32:30.445
You just remember your way out.

32:46.243 --> 32:47.070
This one.

32:48.419 --> 32:50.465
This is the door all the
tour goers fled out of.

32:53.859 --> 32:55.600
- Ah, well, there's no lock.

32:56.993 --> 33:00.039
- All right, so
how do we get in now?

33:00.083 --> 33:02.041
- Well it depends on
what kind of sys...

33:03.042 --> 33:04.914
- Okay, I was not
expecting that.

33:06.655 --> 33:07.917
- It makes sense.

33:09.919 --> 33:11.399
- Hi.

33:11.442 --> 33:13.227
- We thought you were a no show.

33:13.270 --> 33:16.012
- Are you kidding, I wouldn't
miss this for anything.

33:16.055 --> 33:18.493
This is my cameraman
and tech department

33:18.536 --> 33:20.756
all in one, Malcolm.
- Hey.

33:22.192 --> 33:23.933
Sorry, what makes sense?

33:23.976 --> 33:27.415
- The door being open,
they knew we were coming.

33:30.505 --> 33:33.247
- Okay, well, do you
think this is safe?

33:34.465 --> 33:37.120
- You know everything I
know about this place.

33:37.164 --> 33:39.078
But that door being open
doesn't change anything for me.

33:39.122 --> 33:40.906
- I think it's a good sign.

33:40.950 --> 33:42.778
The hotel wants to be heard.

33:42.821 --> 33:44.040
It knows I can help.

33:45.650 --> 33:46.434
Let's go in.

33:49.088 --> 33:50.612
- Okay.

33:51.700 --> 33:54.398
- Do not stop rolling.
- You got it.

33:56.835 --> 33:57.619
- Here we go.

33:59.142 --> 34:00.926
- Don't forget, the
hotel wants to be heard.

34:00.970 --> 34:01.797
- Shut up.

34:02.580 --> 34:04.408
- What the fuck is that?

34:21.817 --> 34:23.688
- Ms. Fox, we're going
to record this conversation

34:23.732 --> 34:24.646
now if that's okay.

34:28.389 --> 34:31.000
Can you tell us anything
you remember of how

34:31.043 --> 34:34.045
you wound up walking along on
the side of the road tonight?

34:37.224 --> 34:39.574
Do you remember anything
from the last few days?

34:43.795 --> 34:44.666
Ms. Fox?

34:46.536 --> 34:48.496
You've been missing
for five days now.

34:50.585 --> 34:52.195
Can you tell us anything
about where you've been

34:52.239 --> 34:55.154
since last Sunday?

34:57.853 --> 34:58.636
Ms. Fox.

35:05.077 --> 35:06.209
- Lights out.

35:17.046 --> 35:18.265
- Brock, we're
splitting up right here,

35:18.308 --> 35:20.310
the fastest way to the
dining room is that way,

35:20.354 --> 35:21.616
fastest way to the
basement is that--

35:21.659 --> 35:23.357
- Got it, we're
gonna go that way.

35:25.881 --> 35:28.971
Oh, and if you hear any
noises, just ignore it.

35:29.014 --> 35:30.973
I have a feeling this hotel

35:32.191 --> 35:34.150
is going to be very
responsive to us.

35:35.282 --> 35:37.501
- Yeah, whatever, good luck.

35:37.545 --> 35:39.982
Just don't fuck around though.

35:40.025 --> 35:42.811
I still have no idea
what happened to Diane.

35:42.854 --> 35:45.161
- I think I'm gonna find
that out while I'm here.

35:46.902 --> 35:47.685
This way.

35:58.261 --> 36:00.655
- Good creak
door, that's a good creak.

36:04.136 --> 36:05.355
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine,

36:05.399 --> 36:07.052
just watch your
step in here, okay?

36:07.096 --> 36:09.272
- Fuck, man.
- Goddamn mess.

36:09.316 --> 36:10.665
Yeah, well they left in a rush.

36:12.144 --> 36:13.972
- That's
one way to put it.

36:14.016 --> 36:17.193
- Yeah, just watch
out it's, step there.

36:19.891 --> 36:21.240
- Fuck.
- Sorry.

36:25.941 --> 36:27.159
- Ugh.

36:29.248 --> 36:30.685
- Wait, what is that?

36:31.947 --> 36:34.384
- It's
Latin, I think?

36:34.428 --> 36:36.691
- What does it
mean, do you know?

36:36.734 --> 36:39.258
- Porta means door
but I don't know.

36:41.391 --> 36:43.132
- I don't remember
that from the docu--

36:43.175 --> 36:45.177
- Dude, seriously,
we're not gonna talk about this?

36:45.221 --> 36:46.744
I mean, the big
harbinger of doom

36:46.788 --> 36:47.876
on the walls.
- Wait, wait, wait.

36:50.705 --> 36:51.880
- What the fuck is that?

36:54.796 --> 36:55.579
- Sarah?

37:09.201 --> 37:11.247
- Let's
keep going on, come on.

37:12.814 --> 37:16.121
- Not gonna lie, for a
haunted house company,

37:16.165 --> 37:19.603
nothing about this tour
seems especially spectacular.

37:19.647 --> 37:20.517
- You kidding?

37:20.561 --> 37:22.563
I heard it was a killer haunt.

37:23.912 --> 37:25.261
- Okay, seriously?

37:25.304 --> 37:27.263
How long have you been
waiting to say that line?

37:27.306 --> 37:29.134
- Had to wait
to get it on camera.

37:30.484 --> 37:31.659
- Oh, this is it.

37:37.752 --> 37:39.275
This is where it all went down.

37:41.364 --> 37:45.150
This is where Andrew
Tully and his followers

37:45.194 --> 37:47.370
killed themselves.

37:49.416 --> 37:50.721
Isn't that right, Tully?

37:53.594 --> 37:54.986
This is where it happened?

37:58.033 --> 37:59.426
- Whoa.

37:59.469 --> 38:00.339
- Oh,

38:00.383 --> 38:01.428
kay.

38:02.254 --> 38:03.865
That's a little unsettling.

38:05.867 --> 38:08.173
Were those there before?

38:09.436 --> 38:10.828
- Brock,
I don't think so.

38:14.876 --> 38:17.748
- Then I guess we
should get to work.

38:19.446 --> 38:20.447
On me.

38:39.683 --> 38:40.771
- That's it.

38:46.255 --> 38:48.039
- And we're
gonna go down there?

38:48.083 --> 38:48.997
- Yep.
- David, you go first,

38:49.040 --> 38:50.955
your light's the best.

38:50.999 --> 38:53.218
- You've gotta be
shitting me right now, really?

38:53.262 --> 38:54.306
- No.

38:56.831 --> 38:59.311
- Okay, okay, all
right, cool, I can do it.

39:00.530 --> 39:02.401
- Just
watch your step.

39:06.362 --> 39:07.494
- That's
awesome, guys, thank you.

39:07.537 --> 39:09.321
Sacrificial lamb and
all, that's great.

39:14.283 --> 39:16.415
Smells like shit down here!

39:20.898 --> 39:21.769
Oh fuck me.

39:23.466 --> 39:25.337
- Here we are.

39:27.557 --> 39:30.342
Right, so it should be
somewhere on the right.

39:30.386 --> 39:31.169
Somewhere.

39:34.259 --> 39:36.392
This one?

39:40.309 --> 39:42.093
- Oh, no shit.

39:46.228 --> 39:49.013
Can you imagine being
chained up in that all day?

39:49.057 --> 39:50.493
- No.

39:50.537 --> 39:52.364
- Yeah,
let's not, let's not.

39:52.408 --> 39:54.410
- Jesus.
- Just don't look at them,

39:54.453 --> 39:55.803
just ignore them.

39:55.846 --> 39:58.066
They'll just freak you
out, here it is, this one.

40:01.373 --> 40:02.679
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

40:02.723 --> 40:04.681
- Here we go.

40:04.725 --> 40:06.553
Whoa, mother lode.

40:07.858 --> 40:09.556
- It's gotta
be in here, right?

40:09.599 --> 40:10.818
- What
else could it be?

40:10.861 --> 40:11.775
- I dunno,
maybe all this shit

40:11.819 --> 40:13.560
just belongs to Hell House, man.

40:13.603 --> 40:14.604
- Why would
they bring all this shit

40:14.648 --> 40:15.953
all the way from the city?

40:15.997 --> 40:17.607
- Gotta keep
your shit somewhere.

40:17.651 --> 40:18.956
- Let's
just get to work,

40:19.000 --> 40:19.870
everybody just grab a
box and start digging.

40:19.914 --> 40:21.611
- All right, don't stop filming,

40:21.655 --> 40:23.352
just set the camera
down somewhere.

40:24.571 --> 40:25.659
Mitchell, you should film too.

40:25.702 --> 40:27.399
- Filming
famous last words.

40:29.532 --> 40:31.795
- The reason we've
decided to commune here

40:31.839 --> 40:33.623
in the dining room is because

40:33.667 --> 40:37.322
this is where Tully's
cult committed suicide

40:37.366 --> 40:40.543
en masse nearly 30 years ago.

40:40.587 --> 40:42.763
Usually the strongest
source for spiritual energy

40:42.806 --> 40:45.069
is the last place the dead

40:45.113 --> 40:48.159
had contact with
the living world.

40:48.203 --> 40:51.423
My planchette will help us
get unanswered questions

40:51.467 --> 40:54.513
from any presence
here left unseen.

40:56.341 --> 40:57.212
Andrew Tully,

40:58.648 --> 41:02.478
this is your house, we
only want to ask questions.

41:02.521 --> 41:03.522
We are guests.

41:05.089 --> 41:08.397
Andrew Tully, are
you here with us now?

41:14.272 --> 41:15.056
Not Tully.

41:16.623 --> 41:19.408
Are you a member of
Tully's group then

41:19.451 --> 41:20.583
here at the hotel?

41:23.412 --> 41:25.806
Not a member of the cult either.

41:25.849 --> 41:28.460
Are you a member of Hell House?

41:30.767 --> 41:33.944
Are you one of the people
who've gone disappearing

41:33.988 --> 41:35.598
since the opening of this hotel?

41:37.774 --> 41:39.646
Spirit, are you lying to me?

41:43.519 --> 41:45.695
Spirit, do you
have anything to do

41:45.739 --> 41:48.393
with the disappearance
of Diane Graves,

41:48.437 --> 41:51.570
Jackson Mallet or any of
the people of Hell House?

41:54.051 --> 41:56.880
- Whoa, let's settle
down a little bit, Brock.

41:56.924 --> 41:57.838
- Spirit,

41:59.448 --> 42:02.843
do you intend to do any harm
to anyone here in the hotel?

42:06.890 --> 42:10.067
Spirit will, oh shit!
- What the fuck is that?

42:10.111 --> 42:12.461
- Okay, we're leaving,
we're leaving.

42:12.504 --> 42:15.333
We don't want anything,
we are going right now.

42:15.377 --> 42:16.378
- Brock, let's
get the fuck outta here.

42:16.421 --> 42:17.553
- Go, go, go, go!

42:43.144 --> 42:45.668
- There ya go.
- What is this?

42:54.503 --> 42:56.505
Okay, I think I have some

42:58.202 --> 43:00.639
hotel blueprints, maybe?

43:00.683 --> 43:03.817
Some sketches.
- It could be important.

43:03.860 --> 43:05.732
- The
layout of the place.

43:07.255 --> 43:09.213
- All right.

43:09.257 --> 43:09.953
- Ugh.

43:12.086 --> 43:13.609
Well, they definitely have rats.

43:17.395 --> 43:18.179
Gross.

43:21.660 --> 43:23.532
- God,
it's dusty, fuck.

43:28.015 --> 43:29.494
Don't know what it is.

43:29.538 --> 43:31.453
Lot of shit down here.

43:31.496 --> 43:33.977
- Hey, were you guys aware

43:34.021 --> 43:36.588
that they have whole
steamed lobster

43:36.632 --> 43:39.722
and a whole range of
items but no nachos?

43:40.941 --> 43:43.030
- Some people like
real food, David.

43:43.073 --> 43:45.336
- Nachos are real
food and I love them.

43:46.685 --> 43:48.949
- Can you focus?
- I am focused on the nachos

43:48.992 --> 43:50.864
that I'm eventually
going to put in my belly.

43:50.907 --> 43:52.169
- All right, well,

43:52.213 --> 43:53.823
we'll get you some
as soon as we leave.

43:53.867 --> 43:55.564
- Awesome.

43:55.607 --> 43:58.872
Even more awesome,
I found tapes.

43:58.915 --> 43:59.829
- What?

43:59.873 --> 44:01.962
- All right, Abaddon Hotel,

44:02.005 --> 44:03.790
From Construction to Completion.

44:05.356 --> 44:07.837
Tully made a documentary.
- That's good, that's good.

44:07.881 --> 44:09.708
Yes.
- All right.

44:09.752 --> 44:11.972
- All right,
that's a keeper for sure.

44:12.015 --> 44:14.713
- Spooky.
- I've got a tape too.

44:14.757 --> 44:16.890
This could be interesting,
it says, it's labeled

44:16.933 --> 44:19.588
"Unaired Commercial."
- Huh, we'll take it.

44:19.631 --> 44:21.590
Take them all, I mean, if it
looks remotely interesting

44:21.633 --> 44:23.810
we should keep it.

44:23.853 --> 44:25.333
- What the?

44:25.376 --> 44:27.465
- Guys, I'm
here, where are you?

44:27.509 --> 44:29.859
- What the fuck?
- Molly, why?

44:29.903 --> 44:33.645
That sounds like Molly.
- I think it was.

44:33.689 --> 44:34.733
- Yo, Molly, is that you?

44:36.431 --> 44:38.563
- Yeah, I'm upstairs.

44:38.607 --> 44:40.348
- She's in, why is she inside?

44:40.391 --> 44:43.655
- Why are you inside when
you're supposed to be outside?

44:45.396 --> 44:48.617
- What, I am at
the main entranceway,

44:48.660 --> 44:50.140
what the hell?

44:50.184 --> 44:51.794
- If she's at the
main entranceway,

44:51.838 --> 44:54.797
just go get her and ask her
what the hell she's doing.

44:54.841 --> 44:57.060
- I get nominated again.
- Okay, if it's the cops

44:57.104 --> 44:59.889
just tell her to stay
calm, lay low, it's fine.

44:59.933 --> 45:00.847
- Cops, okay.

45:01.978 --> 45:03.284
All right, I'm
leaving this here.

45:03.327 --> 45:04.111
- Is that too hard?
- All right, Molly,

45:04.154 --> 45:05.068
I'm on my way.

45:06.678 --> 45:08.767
Hold on to this, in case we
need to get ahold of you guys.

45:08.811 --> 45:09.986
- Just--

45:10.030 --> 45:11.118
- I just don't
want to get shot.

45:11.161 --> 45:12.293
- Just keep her
where she is, okay?

45:12.336 --> 45:14.077
It's not a big deal,
it's just fucking,

45:15.644 --> 45:16.950
you're not gonna get shot.

45:19.866 --> 45:22.651
- Fuck, Molly.
- Oh my god, you scared me!

45:22.694 --> 45:24.696
What's going on?
- Look, I'm sorry,

45:24.740 --> 45:27.003
but what are you doing in here?

45:27.047 --> 45:28.700
- What are you talking about?

45:28.744 --> 45:31.007
- Look, Jessica
told you to stay outside.

45:31.051 --> 45:34.315
- I know, so why did you tell
me to come inside this door?

45:34.358 --> 45:35.664
- Me?
- Yeah.

45:35.707 --> 45:37.100
- I didn't
tell you anything.

45:37.144 --> 45:38.710
- You didn't radio me and
tell me to come inside?

45:38.754 --> 45:40.843
Yeah, you did, David.
- No, I've been down

45:40.887 --> 45:43.933
in the basement digging
through like tapes from 1986,

45:43.977 --> 45:46.936
I didn't tell you anything,
I haven't even touched that

45:46.980 --> 45:49.765
until you called.
- You went on the radio

45:49.808 --> 45:51.898
and you said, "Hey,
Molly, we could use

45:51.941 --> 45:55.162
"some extra hands in here,
why don't you come inside

45:55.205 --> 45:56.685
"and I'll open up the front
door and meet you there."

45:56.728 --> 45:59.731
It was you, why are you screwing
with me, this is not okay!

45:59.775 --> 46:02.125
- Look, look, Molly--
- Stop, I'm not kidding!

46:02.169 --> 46:03.692
Why would you do this to me now?

46:03.735 --> 46:05.346
This is bullshit!
- I didn't do any of that,

46:05.389 --> 46:07.522
I wouldn't do that, let me see.

46:07.565 --> 46:09.524
Just let me see this, okay?

46:09.567 --> 46:11.221
I'm gonna call.
- It's not funny.

46:15.660 --> 46:19.795
- Hey guys, something
very weird is going on here.

46:22.929 --> 46:23.668
- David, are you there?

46:23.712 --> 46:24.756
Are you with Molly?

46:25.801 --> 46:26.628
What's happening?

46:28.412 --> 46:31.285
- Yeah, I'm with her,
she said that I called her

46:31.328 --> 46:32.590
and told her to come in.

46:33.809 --> 46:34.766
- What do you mean
you called her?

46:34.810 --> 46:36.116
We told her to stay outside.

46:37.769 --> 46:40.120
- David, listen, what
door did she come in?

46:41.817 --> 46:43.819
- She came in through
the front door, the tour door.

46:43.862 --> 46:45.734
- And the door she
used, is it closed?

46:47.562 --> 46:48.911
- Oh yeah, it's closed.

46:48.955 --> 46:49.825
- Can you open it?

46:54.961 --> 46:56.832
- No, it's
locked, I don't--

46:56.875 --> 46:58.834
- All right, we're
coming up right now.

47:00.096 --> 47:01.706
Just grab whatever you can,
we've gotta go right now.

47:01.750 --> 47:03.056
- Wait, what's
happening, what's wrong?

47:03.099 --> 47:05.884
- She wasn't supposed
to be in here, get it?

47:05.928 --> 47:07.712
Just go, let's just
go, just move, move.

47:07.756 --> 47:09.062
- We're fine,
nothing's happened.

47:09.105 --> 47:10.324
Calm down, Mitchell, it's fine.

47:10.367 --> 47:12.239
- Jessica, this was
a mistake, okay?

47:12.282 --> 47:15.416
There's something
definitely wrong about this.

47:15.459 --> 47:17.461
- I don't understand, you
just need to calm down

47:17.505 --> 47:18.245
it's fine.
- Just think about it,

47:18.288 --> 47:19.986
think about it.

47:20.029 --> 47:22.901
Just how did you happen
to get the evidence?

47:22.945 --> 47:24.860
Someone knew that it
was gonna draw us here

47:24.903 --> 47:26.166
and it did, it worked.

47:27.384 --> 47:28.733
Fuck, let's go, let's
go, let's go right now.

47:28.777 --> 47:30.039
- Okay, okay, I'm moving.

47:32.955 --> 47:34.391
Okay.
- Just forget about the rest,

47:34.435 --> 47:35.653
let's just go.

47:35.697 --> 47:36.567
- Can you
just calm down a second?

47:36.611 --> 47:37.742
- I am, I'm very calm, let's go.

47:37.786 --> 47:39.222
- Yeah, right, okay.

47:41.703 --> 47:44.358
- What's taking so long?
- They'll be here, I promise.

47:44.401 --> 47:45.185
See!

47:50.973 --> 47:52.931
- Shit.
- Yeah, see?

47:52.975 --> 47:56.239
Tight, now seriously,
guys, who contacted her?

47:56.283 --> 47:57.893
- Nobody did.
- Exactly, that's why

47:57.936 --> 47:59.547
we gotta get outta
here right now.

47:59.590 --> 48:01.331
We've gotta go back the way
we came, I wedged that open.

48:01.375 --> 48:03.072
- Wait, what about Brock?

48:03.116 --> 48:04.943
- Yeah, I kinda
forgot Brock was here.

48:04.987 --> 48:06.989
- Fine,
we'll go that way,

48:07.033 --> 48:08.817
it goes to the dining
room and then to the exit.

48:08.860 --> 48:10.079
- Calm down, okay?

48:13.039 --> 48:14.910
- Jesus Christ.

48:16.390 --> 48:19.393
Is that one working?
- Fuck!

48:23.005 --> 48:25.094
Come on!
- Just calm down,

48:25.138 --> 48:27.096
just keep going.

48:27.140 --> 48:30.752
- Here we
go, come on, come on.

48:37.280 --> 48:39.021
Ugh, this is nasty.

48:46.811 --> 48:47.595
- What?

48:48.639 --> 48:49.988
- What?

48:57.431 --> 48:58.954
- Oh no.

49:03.350 --> 49:05.656
- Shit, is
that Brock and Malcolm?

49:05.700 --> 49:07.354
- What the
fuck is happening?

49:07.397 --> 49:09.617
- This way's the fastest
way to the exit, go!

49:09.660 --> 49:10.487
- Go!
- Go!

49:10.531 --> 49:11.532
- Just go!
- Just go, okay!

49:11.575 --> 49:12.576
Go!
- Go, go!

49:14.187 --> 49:15.666
- Let's go.
- Where's the exit, man?

49:15.710 --> 49:16.493
Come on.

49:27.330 --> 49:28.897
- Jesus Christ
how did that get there?

49:28.940 --> 49:30.551
- Oh my god!
- Fuck, how is that there?

49:30.594 --> 49:32.118
That was in the basement.

49:32.161 --> 49:34.032
- That's our way out, we
gotta go out that way.

49:34.076 --> 49:35.164
- I'm not going
near that fucking thing.

49:35.208 --> 49:36.905
- Oh shit, man.
- It's just a prop.

49:36.948 --> 49:39.864
- How did it get up here?
- It can't hurt us.

49:39.908 --> 49:41.518
It doesn't move.

49:41.562 --> 49:42.780
Okay, let's go.

49:47.829 --> 49:48.612
Oh fuck!

49:49.961 --> 49:51.963
All right, no.
- Come on guys, move move!

49:52.007 --> 49:53.443
Fuck!

49:53.487 --> 49:55.619
- No, no!

49:55.663 --> 49:56.968
- Go, Molly, go!

49:58.622 --> 49:59.928
Go, Molly, come on!

49:59.971 --> 50:02.539
Fuck!

50:03.453 --> 50:05.325
What is that?

50:05.368 --> 50:08.763
- Go, go, go!
- I don't understand.

50:08.806 --> 50:10.330
- I don't wanna be in here.

50:10.373 --> 50:13.159
Please get me out of here.
- Come on, Mitchell, come on.

50:13.202 --> 50:14.899
- Mitchell!
- Come on!

50:14.943 --> 50:16.858
- The
door, there's no knob!

50:16.901 --> 50:18.120
- What do you mean
there's no fucking knob?

50:18.164 --> 50:19.774
- There's no knob!
- All right, all right.

50:19.817 --> 50:22.168
Jess, I've got an
idea, we break it down.

50:22.211 --> 50:24.822
- With what?
- With ourselves.

50:24.866 --> 50:26.694
Don't stop filming!

50:26.737 --> 50:27.521
We got this.

50:30.263 --> 50:31.394
Fuck, that sucks.

50:31.438 --> 50:34.005
Yeah, I'm good.

50:34.049 --> 50:35.181
What is that?

50:37.313 --> 50:38.662
The fuck, okay.

50:40.229 --> 50:41.099
What is that?

50:41.143 --> 50:42.275
Jess, hand me the camera.

50:43.319 --> 50:45.016
Okay, okay, okay.

51:04.949 --> 51:07.648
- Upstairs, let's go upstairs.

51:07.691 --> 51:10.128
Let's go upstairs.
- That's a good idea.

51:10.172 --> 51:12.609
Jess, Jess, we have
to go, come on,

51:12.653 --> 51:15.177
we have to go, go, go, go!
- Okay.

51:15.221 --> 51:17.266
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on, come on, come on.

51:17.310 --> 51:19.007
- Come on.
- Come on!

51:19.050 --> 51:20.400
How are these lights on?

51:20.443 --> 51:21.488
The power's supposed to be out!

51:21.531 --> 51:22.750
- Stop!
- Just ignore them,

51:22.793 --> 51:25.013
just keep moving.

51:26.406 --> 51:27.450
Fuck.
- Jesus.

51:27.494 --> 51:29.060
You okay, you okay?
- Yeah.

51:35.502 --> 51:36.851
- Where the
fuck are we going?

51:36.894 --> 51:39.201
Guys, guys, guys, guys, look.

51:39.245 --> 51:40.594
Look, we can't go up there.

51:40.637 --> 51:41.899
- Why the fuck not?

51:41.943 --> 51:43.510
- Because I
saw your documentary.

51:43.553 --> 51:46.556
- Where else is there to go?
- Look, this is the only way.

51:46.600 --> 51:48.384
- Okay.
- Go, go.

51:52.867 --> 51:54.651
- What, is there
something wrong with this room?

51:54.695 --> 51:58.220
- Oh my god, Mitchell,
Mitchell, are you okay?

51:58.264 --> 51:59.308
- I have to go in there.
- No.

51:59.352 --> 52:00.266
- I have to go.
- You can't.

52:00.309 --> 52:01.876
You can't go in there.

52:01.919 --> 52:05.445
No, no, no, Mitchell, Mitchell,
we have to get out of here!

52:05.488 --> 52:07.011
- Down there,
there's a way to the balcony.

52:07.055 --> 52:08.099
- Let's do
that then, okay?

52:08.143 --> 52:09.492
Come on man.
- Go.

52:09.536 --> 52:11.189
- No ruminating.

52:11.233 --> 52:13.235
No, no, no, no, no.

52:13.279 --> 52:14.628
No, guys, come on.

52:15.455 --> 52:17.021
This is not okay.

52:17.935 --> 52:19.067
This is.

52:19.110 --> 52:20.547
This is.

52:23.550 --> 52:25.247
Oh my god!

52:25.291 --> 52:28.250
Oh my fucking god,
oh my fucking god!

52:30.121 --> 52:31.949
Fuck, let's go in
here, let's go in here.

52:31.993 --> 52:33.777
Go, go, go, go!

52:33.821 --> 52:36.302
- David!

52:36.345 --> 52:38.173
- Go, quick.

52:40.044 --> 52:41.176
- There's no lock,
there's no lock!

52:41.219 --> 52:42.873
- Get me something.
- Here, hold it,

52:42.917 --> 52:44.397
hold it, hold it, hold it shut.

52:44.440 --> 52:45.528
Hold it shut.

52:48.531 --> 52:49.532
Get out of the way.

52:55.886 --> 52:57.235
- Mitchell, Mitchell.

52:57.279 --> 52:59.281
You knew something was
wrong when you fucking heard

52:59.325 --> 53:01.065
Molly on the radio,
what is going on?

53:08.203 --> 53:09.683
- Let's talk a little
bit about Alex Taylor

53:09.726 --> 53:12.250
who's become a
controversial figure

53:12.294 --> 53:15.079
since the release of the
documentary and even before.

53:15.123 --> 53:17.299
Officials from Rockland
County and Abaddon say

53:17.343 --> 53:20.215
that he was never given
permission to use the hotel.

53:20.258 --> 53:21.521
- We didn't.

53:21.564 --> 53:23.436
You know, I remember
several instances where Alex

53:23.479 --> 53:25.916
met with my colleagues and
they cautioned him away

53:25.960 --> 53:27.918
from the hotel, gave
him other options.

53:27.962 --> 53:31.705
- They cautioned him against
or denied him access outright?

53:31.748 --> 53:33.837
- Well, legally speaking,

53:33.881 --> 53:35.709
I don't think they were
allowed to forbid him

53:35.752 --> 53:38.929
from using the hotel, so no.

53:38.973 --> 53:40.409
- Brock, from what you've seen,

53:40.453 --> 53:43.456
have you been able to draw
any conclusions of your own?

53:43.499 --> 53:45.022
- Oh,

53:45.066 --> 53:45.806
for sure.

53:45.849 --> 53:47.373
I mean, Alex

53:48.548 --> 53:50.767
has a certain personality
trait that's common

53:50.811 --> 53:52.116
among people who
start with nothing

53:52.160 --> 53:55.381
and create, build
their own businesses.

53:55.424 --> 53:58.427
They are willing to
take risks, they gamble.

53:58.471 --> 54:02.039
And when they lose
those gambles,

54:02.083 --> 54:03.650
they are willing to double down

54:03.693 --> 54:06.392
and compound their risks.

54:06.435 --> 54:08.742
Things can spiral
out of control.

54:08.785 --> 54:12.310
For Alex, things were definitely
spiraling out of control,

54:12.354 --> 54:15.444
you could make the
argument that Hell House

54:15.488 --> 54:17.359
was not doing well financially

54:17.403 --> 54:19.840
and nobody else in the house
really knew about that,

54:19.883 --> 54:22.146
well, maybe Mack, but

54:22.973 --> 54:23.757
I think

54:24.975 --> 54:27.325
something darker
was at play here,

54:27.369 --> 54:30.154
something more nefarious.

54:30.198 --> 54:33.854
Something was driving him,
something compelling him

54:33.897 --> 54:37.335
down a path toward his demise.

54:37.379 --> 54:40.948
- Well that still
doesn't explain why

54:40.991 --> 54:43.994
he chose the hotel
out of all the other

54:44.038 --> 54:46.344
possible options
available to him.

54:46.388 --> 54:47.258
- I have a theory.

54:48.521 --> 54:49.652
I believe...

54:53.221 --> 54:56.659
I believe he was
contacted by the hotel.

54:56.703 --> 54:59.009
- How do you mean,
the hotel's been closed for--

54:59.053 --> 55:00.968
- No, I don't mean someone
from the front desk

55:01.011 --> 55:03.013
called him to confirm
a reservation.

55:03.057 --> 55:06.277
I believe there's something
within the hotel that...

55:08.802 --> 55:10.630
Orchestrates events.

55:14.460 --> 55:17.724
A chain of events
that plays out like

55:18.942 --> 55:21.162
Almost like dominoes,
cause and effect.

55:22.119 --> 55:23.294
- What's the effect?

55:32.652 --> 55:36.917
- Whatever happened on
October eighth, 2009.

55:37.874 --> 55:39.485
It was set in motion

55:40.442 --> 55:41.835
long before that night.

55:53.237 --> 55:55.979
The leaked transcript,
how did you receive it?

55:56.023 --> 55:57.328
- I got it in the mail.

55:57.372 --> 55:59.592
- Any idea where it came from?

55:59.635 --> 56:02.551
- No, it was anonymous.
- Exactly, so,

56:02.595 --> 56:04.422
so you get an anonymous tip

56:04.466 --> 56:06.990
and you contact me and then,

56:07.034 --> 56:09.210
and then we get your crew here

56:09.253 --> 56:11.429
and then in a few days
we're all trapped in here.

56:11.473 --> 56:12.605
Don't you see?

56:12.648 --> 56:13.823
So it was--
- So you thought this was

56:13.867 --> 56:15.390
all manipulation, then
why did you let us--

56:15.433 --> 56:16.826
- I didn't know,

56:18.045 --> 56:19.568
look, I--
- You should've stopped us!

56:19.612 --> 56:20.917
- No, I honestly didn't think
that we were being baited

56:20.961 --> 56:22.702
until I heard Molly
on the radio, okay?

56:22.745 --> 56:24.268
Why would I even go
in the hotel if I know

56:24.312 --> 56:26.401
I was being baited?
- Okay, okay, we cannot--

56:26.444 --> 56:28.229
- Fuck!
- We cannot stay here.

56:28.272 --> 56:30.231
Mitchell, we need to go
and make a run for it.

56:30.274 --> 56:31.188
We are sitting ducks!
- Did you not see

56:31.232 --> 56:32.407
the same thing I saw out there?

56:32.450 --> 56:34.061
- Check your phone again.
- There's no--

56:34.104 --> 56:35.715
- Just try.

56:35.758 --> 56:39.370
- Try, I tried a million times,
there's no goddamn coverage.

56:39.414 --> 56:40.720
I have nothing, okay,
look, I'm trying.

56:40.763 --> 56:42.939
I'm trying, there's
nothing, nothing.

56:42.983 --> 56:44.767
There's nothing,
there's nothing, okay?

56:44.811 --> 56:48.205
- Wait, wait, what
about the walkie?

56:48.249 --> 56:49.076
Why don't we try a
different channel?

56:49.119 --> 56:50.904
We didn't try that yet.

56:50.947 --> 56:52.427
Okay, okay, okay.

56:52.470 --> 56:53.471
- Maybe someone's gonna get it.

56:53.515 --> 56:55.256
- Okay, okay.

56:55.299 --> 56:57.345
Okay, okay.

56:57.388 --> 56:58.302
Let me try it.

56:58.346 --> 56:59.565
Okay, different channel.

57:00.783 --> 57:02.219
Hello, can anyone
hear us, hello?

57:03.699 --> 57:05.005
Fuck, okay.

57:05.048 --> 57:07.660
Can anyone hear us, hello?

57:07.703 --> 57:10.271
- Yes, yes,
I can hear you.

57:10.314 --> 57:12.621
- Hello, we're stuck
in the Abaddon Hotel,

57:12.665 --> 57:14.492
can you please help us, please!

57:14.536 --> 57:17.408
- Yes, we have you
checked in for October eighth.

57:17.452 --> 57:21.369
Just for you.

57:21.412 --> 57:22.413
- Oh my god.

57:28.594 --> 57:29.377
Fuck.

57:31.074 --> 57:32.902
- Hey guys,

57:32.946 --> 57:34.904
you're gonna want
to check this out.

57:36.297 --> 57:37.994
Like I've been digging
through all these old,

57:38.038 --> 57:39.692
crusty-ass high eight tapes

57:39.735 --> 57:41.737
and then I come across
a couple of these nice,

57:41.781 --> 57:44.000
shiny, new mini-DV tapes

57:44.044 --> 57:46.481
and on one of 'em
you're not gonna believe

57:46.524 --> 57:49.832
who pops up, like seriously,
get over here, get over here.

57:49.876 --> 57:50.703
All right.

57:53.662 --> 57:55.925
Boom, let me freeze frame it.

57:55.969 --> 57:57.274
- What the,

57:57.318 --> 57:58.232
what the fuck is he
doing on this tape?

57:58.275 --> 58:00.495
- Wait, wait, could their tapes

58:00.538 --> 58:01.757
have gotten mixed
up with Tully's?

58:01.801 --> 58:03.498
- No, no, no, no, these
are from the tapes

58:03.541 --> 58:04.760
that we found in
the basement, okay?

58:04.804 --> 58:06.457
There is literally no
one else from Hell House

58:06.501 --> 58:07.937
on these tapes.
- What are they saying?

58:07.981 --> 58:09.373
Have you listened?
- They're having some kind

58:09.417 --> 58:10.940
of meeting, I can't
really tell yet.

58:10.984 --> 58:12.594
- Who was meeting who?

58:12.638 --> 58:17.207
- Alex and then someone else
that I haven't even seen yet.

58:17.251 --> 58:19.601
Like, okay, look at
the hard-coded date.

58:19.645 --> 58:21.255
That's April, okay?

58:21.298 --> 58:23.518
That's six months before
the fucking tragedy.

58:23.561 --> 58:26.347
- Alex, he.
- Six months.

58:26.390 --> 58:27.522
- He'd always given
the impression that--

58:27.565 --> 58:30.090
- That he had never
been there before.

58:30.133 --> 58:31.439
- Right.

58:31.482 --> 58:32.788
- Then what the fuck,
we have to watch this.

58:32.832 --> 58:35.356
- All right, all right,
hold onto your butts.

58:44.191 --> 58:45.801
- And where the fuck
have you been, huh?

58:45.845 --> 58:46.715
I've been calling you for weeks

58:46.759 --> 58:48.151
and they go to voicemail.

58:48.195 --> 58:49.500
I can sue you, you know?

58:49.544 --> 58:50.937
- You knew it was
high risk, I told you

58:50.980 --> 58:53.853
something like this could
happen, it was bad luck.

58:53.896 --> 58:55.463
- Bad luck?

58:55.506 --> 58:59.249
No, no, no, no, no, but I
lost a fortune on that, okay?

58:59.293 --> 59:00.729
What the fuck am I
supposed to do now?

59:00.773 --> 59:01.991
- What are
you supposed to do?

59:02.035 --> 59:04.385
I don't know, Alex, take
some responsibility?

59:04.428 --> 59:08.606
- No, no, no, no, you
reached out to me, okay?

59:08.650 --> 59:10.043
You called me, why
did you do that?

59:10.086 --> 59:11.871
Were you trying to scam
me from the beginning?

59:11.914 --> 59:13.655
- You're obviously
business savvy,

59:13.699 --> 59:16.440
Hell House is a huge success
in the highly-successful

59:16.484 --> 59:18.486
Halloween market like New York.

59:19.530 --> 59:20.575
- Yeah, it was.

59:22.229 --> 59:23.491
It was.

59:23.534 --> 59:24.405
- What do you mean was?

59:24.448 --> 59:25.580
You've still got the business.

59:27.582 --> 59:29.410
Alex, you didn't.

59:30.716 --> 59:33.588
You invested the company's
money and not your own,

59:33.631 --> 59:37.548
oh wow, did I have
you pegged so wrong.

59:37.592 --> 59:40.029
That's some tough explaining
to your pal, Mack.

59:40.073 --> 59:43.206
Say, Alex, where did
all our money go?

59:43.250 --> 59:46.601
Well, Mack, it's gone,
but on a brighter note,

59:46.644 --> 59:49.952
Rockland County is really
lovely this time of year.

59:49.996 --> 59:53.303
Wish I could be a fly
on the wall for that.

59:53.347 --> 59:57.743
Relax, Alex, I think I
might be able to help you.

59:57.786 --> 59:59.222
- How?

59:59.266 --> 01:00:01.311
- What do you
think of this place?

01:00:01.355 --> 01:00:02.660
- This hotel?

01:00:02.704 --> 01:00:05.141
It's a dump.
- Well, sure,

01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:07.404
it hasn't had guests
in a few decades,

01:00:07.448 --> 01:00:08.884
but what do you think about it?

01:00:11.582 --> 01:00:13.497
- I don't know,
it's kinda freaky.

01:00:13.541 --> 01:00:15.108
Easy to get lost.

01:00:15.151 --> 01:00:17.371
I mean, who makes it that
hard to find a dining room?

01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:19.112
- Fun, right?

01:00:19.155 --> 01:00:21.679
It's been in my possession
for a very long time

01:00:21.723 --> 01:00:23.029
and I've been looking
to do something

01:00:23.072 --> 01:00:24.770
to put it back on the map.

01:00:26.423 --> 01:00:28.164
- Something like what?

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:29.862
- An attraction
of some kind.

01:00:30.863 --> 01:00:34.518
A haunted house, perhaps?

01:00:34.562 --> 01:00:38.784
You could help me give
this hotel a second life.

01:00:59.674 --> 01:01:02.720
- Are we all
gonna die in here?

01:01:04.679 --> 01:01:06.724
- Molly, no, no, no, no.

01:01:06.768 --> 01:01:09.118
Just stay calm, we are
gonna figure this out

01:01:09.162 --> 01:01:12.078
and then we're gonna get
out of here, I promise you.

01:01:12.121 --> 01:01:12.905
Okay?

01:01:15.908 --> 01:01:17.300
I didn't think.

01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:20.651
I didn't know.

01:01:23.306 --> 01:01:24.220
There was

01:01:26.005 --> 01:01:27.180
so much blood.

01:01:30.096 --> 01:01:31.358
- Whose blood?

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:33.839
Where did you see the blood?

01:01:35.362 --> 01:01:36.145
His blood.

01:01:40.497 --> 01:01:42.804
Her blood, my blood.

01:01:47.722 --> 01:01:52.379
They laughed and laughed
and laughed and...

01:02:20.581 --> 01:02:21.364
Do you know,

01:02:22.888 --> 01:02:25.238
in the Bible they call
it the lake of fire.

01:02:28.241 --> 01:02:30.025
- Can you tell
us who you were with?

01:02:31.635 --> 01:02:33.507
Where have you been
the last few days?

01:02:34.769 --> 01:02:37.076
- Just conserve your energy.
- For what?

01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:39.774
What's the plan?

01:02:39.817 --> 01:02:40.601
I mean,

01:02:41.863 --> 01:02:44.083
we have to make a run
for it, eventually,

01:02:44.126 --> 01:02:46.085
I mean we have to, didn't
you say there was a balcony?

01:02:46.128 --> 01:02:48.696
- Yes, yes, there is a
balcony, I saw it on the tapes.

01:02:48.739 --> 01:02:50.089
- Then that's where
we have to go.

01:02:50.132 --> 01:02:52.004
- Yes, eventually,
just not right now.

01:02:52.918 --> 01:02:54.223
You saw what's out there.

01:02:56.704 --> 01:02:57.487
- Fine.

01:02:58.488 --> 01:02:59.881
- If we get outta here,

01:03:00.882 --> 01:03:02.014
I want a vacation.

01:03:04.581 --> 01:03:07.758
A whole week where
you don't get to call,

01:03:07.802 --> 01:03:09.238
text or e-mail me

01:03:10.283 --> 01:03:12.633
and I can just sit on the couch

01:03:12.676 --> 01:03:15.723
and binge watch So You
Think You Can Dance.

01:03:17.116 --> 01:03:18.465
Is that a deal?

01:03:20.946 --> 01:03:22.730
- Yeah, it's a deal.

01:03:37.179 --> 01:03:37.963
I'm sorry.

01:03:41.053 --> 01:03:41.967
- Shh, shh.

01:03:47.624 --> 01:03:48.799
- Sleep sweet.

01:03:48.843 --> 01:03:50.671
Shit!

01:03:50.714 --> 01:03:51.889
- Fuck.
- Who turned off the lights?

01:03:51.933 --> 01:03:53.152
- David?
- Damn it!

01:03:53.195 --> 01:03:55.937
- I can't,
where are you, David?

01:03:55.981 --> 01:03:57.069
- I'm over
here by the camera.

01:03:57.112 --> 01:03:58.331
- Who turned off the light?
- Okay.

01:03:58.374 --> 01:03:59.985
- Just crawl
towards the sound.

01:04:01.987 --> 01:04:04.641
Okay, okay, okay, I told you.
- What's wrong with it?

01:04:04.685 --> 01:04:05.860
- There's nothing
this camera can do

01:04:05.903 --> 01:04:07.383
that I can't fix.
- Come on!

01:04:07.427 --> 01:04:09.559
- I'm working, Jess, and...

01:04:09.603 --> 01:04:10.734
- Come on.
- Boom!

01:04:10.778 --> 01:04:11.866
Boom, got it.

01:04:11.909 --> 01:04:12.954
Got it, see?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:04:12.998 --> 01:04:14.042
- What did it tell you, got it.

01:04:14.086 --> 01:04:16.131
See, I told you.
- Okay.

01:04:17.219 --> 01:04:18.351
What the fuck?

01:04:18.394 --> 01:04:19.961
- What, what?
- Why is the door open?

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:23.617
- More importantly,
where the fuck is Molly?

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:24.792
- Molly?
- She wouldn't

01:04:24.835 --> 01:04:27.055
just get up and
walk the fuck out!

01:04:27.099 --> 01:04:28.404
- She wouldn't get
out of this room by herself.

01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:29.753
- Molly!
- Stop!

01:04:29.797 --> 01:04:32.452
- Hey, Molly, come on!
- Stop, stop, stop.

01:04:32.495 --> 01:04:33.757
- All right, all right.
- Listen.

01:04:33.801 --> 01:04:35.150
I'm chill.
- We'll go get her.

01:04:35.194 --> 01:04:36.760
We'll go get her.
- Jessica, tell him I'm chill!

01:04:36.804 --> 01:04:38.458
- Okay, he's okay.
- Fine, you're chill,

01:04:38.501 --> 01:04:40.242
you're chill, I get it.
- He's okay.

01:04:40.286 --> 01:04:42.157
Okay, calm down.
- What is that?

01:04:43.941 --> 01:04:46.031
That wasn't here before.

01:04:50.861 --> 01:04:53.168
- Mitchell,
Mitchell, what is it?

01:04:53.212 --> 01:04:54.996
- Mitchell?

01:04:57.477 --> 01:04:58.608
- What is it?

01:05:00.045 --> 01:05:02.047
- Jessica,
what does it say?

01:05:03.831 --> 01:05:05.398
- It says,

01:05:05.441 --> 01:05:08.444
"Lovely Molly's in the
basement with her friends."

01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:09.880
- This basement,
the basement here?

01:05:09.924 --> 01:05:11.056
- I don't know,
that's what it says!

01:05:11.099 --> 01:05:12.970
- No, come on!
- No, no, no.

01:05:13.014 --> 01:05:15.408
David, stop it!
- Listen.

01:05:15.451 --> 01:05:18.411
- We're gonna find her.
- I just want to get her back.

01:05:18.454 --> 01:05:20.587
- Okay, we know, we all
want her back, just be calm.

01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:22.067
- I promise you we'll
go get her we just--

01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:25.592
- You promise me, Mitchell.
- Just don't, I promise,

01:05:25.635 --> 01:05:27.768
I promise, just don't be
stupid about this, okay?

01:05:27.811 --> 01:05:28.638
I'll go first

01:05:29.813 --> 01:05:31.902
and Jessica, you go next

01:05:31.946 --> 01:05:33.730
and then you get
our backs, okay?

01:05:33.774 --> 01:05:35.036
- Okay, we're gonna get her.

01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:36.994
- Okay.

01:05:37.952 --> 01:05:38.822
- We have to go slowly.
- Come on.

01:05:38.866 --> 01:05:42.130
- Slowly, shh, be quiet.

01:05:42.174 --> 01:05:43.914
- Going to the basement.

01:05:44.959 --> 01:05:46.743
Going to the basement.

01:05:48.005 --> 01:05:49.268
We're going to the
fucking basement.

01:06:00.235 --> 01:06:03.108
Watch your head, Jess.
- Okay, okay.

01:06:19.211 --> 01:06:22.039
- It's clear,
it's clear, let's go.

01:06:22.083 --> 01:06:24.433
- Where are you?
- It's clear.

01:06:24.477 --> 01:06:26.609
- Stay close, stay close.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.402
- What the fuck?

01:06:37.751 --> 01:06:39.970
How are these lights working?

01:06:45.976 --> 01:06:47.761
- Let's go.

01:07:09.565 --> 01:07:10.392
Okay, okay.

01:07:16.964 --> 01:07:18.008
- Fuck.

01:07:20.315 --> 01:07:21.186
- This way.

01:07:29.716 --> 01:07:32.153
- Do you see her?
- Shh, shh.

01:07:52.086 --> 01:07:54.219
- What, what?

01:07:57.178 --> 01:07:58.962
Oh my god!
- What, what?

01:07:59.006 --> 01:08:01.791
- Keep it together,
Jess, just keep it together.

01:08:01.835 --> 01:08:04.272
- Oh fuck, no, we
have to go and get her!

01:08:04.316 --> 01:08:06.100
- No, no, no, David.
- Go get her now.

01:08:06.143 --> 01:08:08.972
- Just be careful, we don't
know what the fuck is in here.

01:08:09.016 --> 01:08:10.539
- Okay.
- Just take it easy.

01:08:10.583 --> 01:08:12.367
Just take it slow, I've got
your back but take it slow.

01:08:12.411 --> 01:08:14.021
- All right.

01:08:16.066 --> 01:08:17.459
Jess?
- Yes.

01:08:17.502 --> 01:08:21.594
- Just take the camera.
- Okay, okay, I've got it.

01:08:21.636 --> 01:08:22.421
Okay.

01:08:24.379 --> 01:08:26.642
Come on, Mitchell,
let's do this.

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:28.340
- Hold on.

01:08:30.255 --> 01:08:31.081
You go slow.

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:34.259
I got your back but go slow.

01:08:35.085 --> 01:08:36.304
- Molly.

01:08:36.348 --> 01:08:37.871
Molly.

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:38.785
- Easy.

01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:41.221
No sudden moves.

01:08:42.267 --> 01:08:44.747
- Fuck, something's coming!
- Molly?

01:08:44.791 --> 01:08:46.358
- Mitchell,
Mitchell, hurry!

01:08:46.401 --> 01:08:48.447
- Molly, I need you to get up.
- Hurry, hurry, it's coming.

01:08:48.490 --> 01:08:52.145
Wake up now.

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.149
- Hurry, it's
coming, it's coming!

01:08:55.192 --> 01:08:57.064
- Oh my god!

01:08:59.587 --> 01:09:02.024
- Molly, come
on, you're all right,

01:09:02.069 --> 01:09:03.331
we've gotta get you outta here!

01:09:03.375 --> 01:09:06.116
- Go, go, go,
go, get out, get out!

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:07.203
- Go!
- Come on!

01:09:07.247 --> 01:09:09.032
Come on, get out, now!

01:09:09.076 --> 01:09:11.165
Go Jessica, go, go, go, go!

01:09:18.433 --> 01:09:20.870
- Oh my god!
- David!

01:09:20.913 --> 01:09:22.176
David!
- Get out of here!

01:09:22.219 --> 01:09:23.264
Go, go!

01:09:24.091 --> 01:09:26.702
Molly, where are you?

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:27.529
Fuck.

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:30.227
Oh my god, where are you?

01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:31.403
I don't know how to get out.

01:09:31.446 --> 01:09:33.796
Molly run, run, Molly, run!

01:09:36.582 --> 01:09:38.932
Quick.
- Get the door.

01:09:40.934 --> 01:09:42.196
Fucking open!

01:09:42.238 --> 01:09:44.198
- Stop it,
stop it, it's locked,

01:09:44.241 --> 01:09:45.591
it's locked, fuck.

01:09:47.027 --> 01:09:52.032
Molly, where are you?

01:09:53.685 --> 01:09:54.861
- Oh my god!

01:09:55.949 --> 01:09:59.082
- Stop, please, no!

01:10:01.868 --> 01:10:03.565
Come here, where is it?

01:10:03.609 --> 01:10:04.827
- Where is it?
- Do you see it?

01:10:04.871 --> 01:10:05.654
Shh, shh.

01:10:07.134 --> 01:10:08.222
Molly?

01:10:08.265 --> 01:10:10.267
Where are you, Molly?
- I'm here.

01:10:10.311 --> 01:10:12.922
- Look, where is it?

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:22.236
- We have on the phone
right now Jessica Fox,

01:10:22.279 --> 01:10:26.240
Editor of the new
and controversial
website The Inside,

01:10:26.283 --> 01:10:29.199
she'd like to weigh in on the
topic of the Abaddon Hotel.

01:10:29.243 --> 01:10:30.940
Jessica, you're
on air, go ahead.

01:10:30.984 --> 01:10:32.899
- Hi Suzy, thanks
for this opportunity,

01:10:32.942 --> 01:10:35.510
I wanna start by saying--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,

01:10:35.554 --> 01:10:37.120
wait a minute, Jessica Fox?

01:10:37.164 --> 01:10:38.731
You're the one that's
been writing about

01:10:38.774 --> 01:10:40.994
the hotel recently, right?

01:10:41.037 --> 01:10:43.126
Saying how you know for a fact

01:10:43.170 --> 01:10:45.259
that Tully was some
kind of boogey man

01:10:45.302 --> 01:10:48.784
and that the town has been
complicit in some ways?

01:10:48.828 --> 01:10:51.178
This is why people
laugh at internet blogs,

01:10:51.221 --> 01:10:54.268
lies under the guise of
journalism is fake news.

01:10:54.311 --> 01:10:58.315
You had the chance to be the
next Buzzfeed but instead,

01:10:58.359 --> 01:11:00.796
you're chasing ghost stories
and it's gonna be your funeral

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.407
because there's nothing--
- I have physical proof

01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:05.061
of Tully's involvement in the
disappearance of his guests,

01:11:05.105 --> 01:11:07.237
the town's involvement
in the subsequent coverup

01:11:07.281 --> 01:11:08.804
and the link to Hell House.

01:11:08.848 --> 01:11:11.459
- Then why aren't you
typing away in your Brooklyn

01:11:11.503 --> 01:11:14.331
studio apartment instead
of calling in here?

01:11:14.375 --> 01:11:16.812
By all means, break
the case wide open.

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:18.684
- I intend
to do just that.

01:11:18.727 --> 01:11:19.989
If you're on the town's payroll,

01:11:20.033 --> 01:11:21.904
I would resign right
now if I were you,

01:11:21.948 --> 01:11:24.211
things are going to get very
messy for that little town.

01:11:24.254 --> 01:11:26.213
- What is the purpose
of this call, really?

01:11:26.256 --> 01:11:28.781
If you had proof, you
wouldn't be calling here

01:11:28.824 --> 01:11:32.393
with empty, vague threats.
- Jessica, do you have proof?

01:11:32.437 --> 01:11:34.439
Do you plan on revealing it?

01:11:34.482 --> 01:11:36.397
- Mitchell, if you
want to know what happened

01:11:36.441 --> 01:11:38.443
to Diane, then come and find me.

01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:45.188
- I'm not sure what
she was alluding to

01:11:45.232 --> 01:11:48.365
but apparently she
knows where Diane is.

01:11:48.409 --> 01:11:51.978
- This is what we run
into in our town, Suzy.

01:11:52.021 --> 01:11:54.415
We have limited resources

01:11:54.459 --> 01:11:56.765
but we have to spend
money that we don't have

01:11:56.809 --> 01:12:01.204
guarding the hotel, defending
ourselves from slander from

01:12:01.248 --> 01:12:05.557
Mitchell here and the
internet crazy Ms. Fox.

01:12:59.785 --> 01:13:01.874
- Yeah, I'm just nervous.

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.573
I don't know, Mom, it
just feels like Alex

01:13:05.617 --> 01:13:08.445
is just, you know,
keeping something from us.

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:11.840
Yeah, I know, once we
get through opening night

01:13:11.884 --> 01:13:13.886
it'll all be
downhill from there.

01:13:13.929 --> 01:13:16.366
No, Mom, I already told
you, I'm dead already.

01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:18.978
He took us to Hell and
Mitchell's coming with us.

01:14:04.501 --> 01:14:06.808
- Look, we can talk about
this for days on end,

01:14:08.288 --> 01:14:11.378
the only thing I can
assure the audience is that

01:14:11.421 --> 01:14:14.511
I did nothing to
alter those tapes.

01:14:14.555 --> 01:14:16.513
I think that the hotel
is very dangerous

01:14:16.557 --> 01:14:19.125
and everyone should
stay away from it.

01:14:19.168 --> 01:14:21.562
It's not a joke,

01:14:21.606 --> 01:14:22.607
okay, this is real.

01:14:24.391 --> 01:14:25.435
This is real.

01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:29.831
- Do you intend to
stay away from the hotel?

01:14:47.196 --> 01:14:47.980
- I do.

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.029
Even though I wanna
know what happened

01:14:54.073 --> 01:14:57.642
just as much as anyone
else, probably more.

01:14:59.121 --> 01:15:00.514
- Because of Diane?

01:15:03.735 --> 01:15:04.518
- Yeah.

01:15:09.523 --> 01:15:10.655
Yeah, because of Diane.

01:15:15.268 --> 01:15:16.095
But also

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:19.489
because of the genuine curiosity

01:15:19.533 --> 01:15:22.797
that got me into documentary
filmmaking in the first place.

01:15:24.581 --> 01:15:27.106
But I have no intention of
ever entering the Abaddon.

01:15:28.455 --> 01:15:30.500
- Thank you, Mitchell.

01:15:30.544 --> 01:15:33.373
You set a fine example
by saying that.

01:15:34.635 --> 01:15:37.464
- Well, I think we'll
end on that positive note

01:15:37.507 --> 01:15:38.900
and some agreement.

01:15:38.944 --> 01:15:41.468
Thank you to my panel
for the lively debate

01:15:41.511 --> 01:15:43.731
and thank you for
watching the show.

01:15:43.775 --> 01:15:46.516
Next week we'll continue to
focus on the Abaddon Hotel

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.997
and I'll be interviewing
wealthy tech entrepreneur

01:15:49.041 --> 01:15:52.174
Russell Wynn, who claims
he's been receiving

01:15:52.218 --> 01:15:55.743
anonymous packages
containing unseen video

01:15:55.787 --> 01:15:57.571
from the Abaddon Hotel.

01:15:57.614 --> 01:16:00.487
And he's been quietly
putting it all together.

01:16:01.706 --> 01:16:04.578
And we'll hear about
that and his plans

01:16:04.621 --> 01:16:09.104
to relocate his popular
site-specific play Insomnia.

01:16:11.541 --> 01:16:13.761
- And we're clear.

01:16:17.069 --> 01:16:19.288
- Hey man, you
serious about that?

01:16:19.332 --> 01:16:20.855
- About what?

01:16:20.899 --> 01:16:22.727
- About not
going back to the hotel.

01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:24.990
- I think so, why?

01:16:25.033 --> 01:16:27.688
- Because I know you're
lying to my face.

01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:31.692
You'll come back and if you're
trying to get to the secrets

01:16:31.736 --> 01:16:35.087
that only ghosts keep,
you need Brock Davies.

01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:37.611
- I'm never gonna set
foot there, Brock,

01:16:37.654 --> 01:16:39.178
you should stay away as well.

01:16:42.224 --> 01:16:43.182
- Okay.

01:16:43.225 --> 01:16:45.271
- Monica, can we
re-do the intro?

01:16:45.314 --> 01:16:46.968
I felt like some of
it was a bit stale

01:16:47.012 --> 01:16:49.666
and I wanna change some of
the lines in the beginning.

01:16:51.799 --> 01:16:54.323
- We just got a
call from Arnold Tasselman.

01:16:54.367 --> 01:16:56.151
- Yeah, he just left,
what did he forget?

01:16:56.195 --> 01:16:58.719
- That's the weird
thing, he called to apologize

01:16:58.763 --> 01:17:00.286
that he missed the
interview, he said he was in

01:17:00.329 --> 01:17:03.376
a minor accident on the
way here and he's sorry

01:17:03.419 --> 01:17:05.160
that he missed it, he
couldn't call until now.

01:17:05.204 --> 01:17:06.509
- What do you mean
he missed the show?

01:17:06.553 --> 01:17:08.729
I just interviewed him.
- I know,

01:17:08.773 --> 01:17:11.079
it sounded just like him, he
said for the last two hours

01:17:11.123 --> 01:17:12.428
he's been dealing
with the police

01:17:12.472 --> 01:17:14.691
and the insurance and
this woman that he hit.

01:17:15.867 --> 01:17:18.434
- The fucking same
Arnold Tasselman

01:17:18.478 --> 01:17:21.568
who was just in the
studio 30 seconds ago?

01:17:26.834 --> 01:17:28.618
- Mitchell.
- Shh, shh.

01:17:29.619 --> 01:17:31.665
- Untie me.
- Shh, shh.

01:17:32.753 --> 01:17:34.581
- Mitchell.
- Oh my god.

01:17:36.235 --> 01:17:37.410
- Leave 'em be.

01:17:40.195 --> 01:17:42.415
- What are you doing here?

01:17:44.504 --> 01:17:46.549
What the fuck are
you doing here?

01:17:46.593 --> 01:17:48.900
- You're having trouble
putting this together?

01:17:53.121 --> 01:17:54.122
- But this can't be.

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:58.213
You're--
- I'm what, Mitchell?

01:17:58.257 --> 01:18:00.650
- You're dead, you're dead.

01:18:00.694 --> 01:18:03.218
- For a long time, now.

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:04.654
Pick up the camera.

01:18:09.659 --> 01:18:11.836
Pick up the goddamn camera.

01:18:23.717 --> 01:18:24.718
Nice to meet you,

01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:27.460
I'm Andrew Tully

01:18:27.503 --> 01:18:31.681
and you are a guest in my hotel.

01:18:31.725 --> 01:18:34.554
A permanent guest
like my friends here?

01:18:36.382 --> 01:18:37.774
We'll see.

01:18:37.818 --> 01:18:42.649
Oh have you ever met the
Hell House brain trust?

01:18:42.692 --> 01:18:44.825
This here is Mack,

01:18:44.869 --> 01:18:46.827
his friendship to Alex

01:18:46.871 --> 01:18:50.526
doomed him long before they
ever opened Hell House.

01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:52.659
We almost lost Tony if
it weren't for Mack here

01:18:52.702 --> 01:18:56.619
spilling the beans at
just the right moment

01:18:56.663 --> 01:19:01.668
and this is the most important
piece of my domino set.

01:19:03.278 --> 01:19:04.801
Alex Taylor.

01:19:06.499 --> 01:19:09.719
I was surprised how easily
you were manipulated by me.

01:19:10.895 --> 01:19:14.115
Almost as easy as Alex,
right on television.

01:19:15.987 --> 01:19:20.078
All I ever wanted
was for more guests.

01:19:21.514 --> 01:19:23.385
♪ Be my guest

01:19:23.429 --> 01:19:25.953
♪ Be my guest

01:19:25.997 --> 01:19:27.389
And you all came.

01:19:28.521 --> 01:19:31.698
Just like Alex.

01:19:31.741 --> 01:19:33.134
Just like Diane.

01:19:35.702 --> 01:19:37.747
Don't you dare drop that camera!

01:19:45.712 --> 01:19:46.756
Now,

01:19:47.670 --> 01:19:48.889
I have to warn you,

01:19:50.021 --> 01:19:52.719
this is gonna be very
difficult for you

01:19:52.762 --> 01:19:57.376
and you are gonna have to
make some tough decisions

01:19:57.419 --> 01:20:00.596
on how we keep the
dominoes falling

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:03.512
and our hotel open.

01:20:07.995 --> 01:20:09.257
Oh,

01:20:10.824 --> 01:20:15.046
you were under the impression
that we closed the hotel.

01:20:16.308 --> 01:20:20.529
The hotel has never
been fucking closed!

01:20:20.573 --> 01:20:22.270
When we died here 30 years ago,

01:20:22.314 --> 01:20:24.969
that was just our
grand relaunch!

01:20:26.231 --> 01:20:29.974
Alex here, well he thought
he was opening up Hell House

01:20:30.017 --> 01:20:33.064
in an abandoned hotel, well,

01:20:33.107 --> 01:20:34.891
we never left.

01:20:36.806 --> 01:20:40.071
The hotel has always
been occupied.

01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:44.640
Our lake of fire

01:20:44.684 --> 01:20:47.078
that we have chosen to enter,

01:20:47.121 --> 01:20:51.256
not been cast away to
like your Bible would say.

01:20:52.474 --> 01:20:55.912
That's right, Mitchell,
I found the gateway.

01:20:55.956 --> 01:20:58.828
And it's glorious.

01:21:01.179 --> 01:21:02.528
Play us a song.

01:21:13.017 --> 01:21:13.974
- Diane?

01:21:15.889 --> 01:21:17.891
No!

01:21:22.896 --> 01:21:24.289
- No, no, no, no, no,

01:21:24.332 --> 01:21:26.552
we're not done here,
Mitchell, you have more to do

01:21:26.595 --> 01:21:30.817
before you can give up,
there are choices to make.

01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:33.515
Will someone help him
with that damn camera!

01:21:49.401 --> 01:21:50.184
Mitchell.

01:21:52.143 --> 01:21:52.969
Mitchell.

01:21:54.623 --> 01:21:56.669
Tell me who leaves here today.

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.371
In order to keep the
dominoes falling,

01:22:03.415 --> 01:22:05.417
one of you will get to leave.

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:07.984
Now, who is it gonna be?

01:22:11.945 --> 01:22:14.208
We thought that you wouldn't
be too eager to choose

01:22:14.252 --> 01:22:17.472
so I'll take someone out
of the running quickly.

01:22:23.174 --> 01:22:26.133
We are legion, we are
servants of the snake

01:22:26.177 --> 01:22:29.180
and we will release someone
into the lake of fire.

01:22:31.704 --> 01:22:32.487
- No.
- No.

01:22:32.531 --> 01:22:34.141
- No.
- No, please no.

01:22:34.185 --> 01:22:35.838
- No, no.
- No!

01:22:40.147 --> 01:22:42.062
- Molly, no, Molly!

01:22:42.106 --> 01:22:42.889
No, Molly!

01:22:43.977 --> 01:22:45.413
Molly!

01:22:45.457 --> 01:22:47.111
No, no!

01:22:51.158 --> 01:22:51.941
Molly.

01:22:53.769 --> 01:22:56.381
- Oh, they
chose lovely Molly.

01:22:56.424 --> 01:22:58.992
Oh, we definitely want her.

01:22:59.035 --> 01:23:02.038
The perpetually scared
make for the best guests.

01:23:03.649 --> 01:23:04.867
- Please stop.

01:23:06.521 --> 01:23:08.523
- It won't stop,

01:23:08.567 --> 01:23:10.046
it never stops,

01:23:10.090 --> 01:23:13.876
we go on and on into eternity.

01:23:14.747 --> 01:23:15.835
Now Mitchell!

01:23:17.532 --> 01:23:20.013
Pick who gets to walk
out of my front door,

01:23:20.056 --> 01:23:23.016
it's not my choice, I
already made my choices.

01:23:29.979 --> 01:23:32.808
I know what comes next.

01:23:32.852 --> 01:23:37.509
And it begins with what
happens in this room right now.

01:23:37.552 --> 01:23:39.685
Much later, way down the road,

01:23:39.728 --> 01:23:42.427
someone will come to this hotel

01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:45.952
just like Alex did and
try to open it up again,

01:23:45.995 --> 01:23:48.650
I know this already,
just like I knew

01:23:48.694 --> 01:23:53.177
that Jessica would come
with one anonymous package.

01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:59.008
I have been sending this
unfortunate person videos

01:23:59.052 --> 01:24:01.228
including this one here.

01:24:02.882 --> 01:24:05.014
I see it now, Mitchell,

01:24:05.058 --> 01:24:07.626
it's gonna be bigger
than Hell House,

01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:12.239
more souls for our lake of fire.

01:24:12.283 --> 01:24:15.634
That series of dominoes begins

01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:18.724
now.

01:24:58.111 --> 01:25:00.679
- No, please,
you don't have to do this,

01:25:00.722 --> 01:25:02.550
please stop, no, no,
no, what are you doing?

01:25:02.594 --> 01:25:03.725
No!

01:25:03.769 --> 01:25:04.900
No!

01:25:04.944 --> 01:25:06.685
No!

01:25:32.101 --> 01:25:33.494
- Ma'am if you
don't tell us anything

01:25:33.538 --> 01:25:34.887
we won't be able to find the
people who did this to you

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:36.236
and the people you were with.

01:25:39.587 --> 01:25:42.286
Can you give us any nearby
landmarks where this happened?

01:25:43.156 --> 01:25:44.157
Was it near a park?

01:25:45.854 --> 01:25:46.638
A restaurant?

01:25:48.248 --> 01:25:49.728
Do you remember a road name?

01:26:04.656 --> 01:26:05.439
Yeah.

01:26:06.614 --> 01:26:08.442
Okay, I'll be right there.

01:26:14.666 --> 01:26:17.233
We're going to need to call--
- The Abaddon.

01:26:17.277 --> 01:26:18.147
- What?

01:26:18.191 --> 01:26:19.801
- The Abaddon Hotel.

01:26:23.892 --> 01:26:24.850
That's where I was.

01:26:29.768 --> 01:26:31.030
You should go there.

01:27:15.204 --> 01:27:17.032
- What are you
doing, what is this?

01:27:17.076 --> 01:27:19.644
- Protecting myself, I want
this recorded for insurance.

01:27:19.687 --> 01:27:21.167
- You mean for blackmail?

01:27:21.210 --> 01:27:22.255
- Blackmail?

01:27:22.298 --> 01:27:23.517
No, Alex, I want
it on the record

01:27:23.561 --> 01:27:25.214
that I had nothing
to do with this.

01:27:26.564 --> 01:27:28.479
- So you're looking out
for yourself, I get it.

01:27:28.522 --> 01:27:30.219
Is it on?
- Yeah.

01:27:30.263 --> 01:27:31.307
- Great.

01:27:32.526 --> 01:27:34.789
Mack had nothing
to do with this.

01:27:35.616 --> 01:27:37.183
- Just tell me what happened.

01:27:37.226 --> 01:27:39.054
- Dude, it's fine, we
have a way out now, okay?

01:27:39.098 --> 01:27:40.447
- A way out?
- Yeah.

01:27:40.491 --> 01:27:42.318
- Alex, you lost everything.

01:27:42.362 --> 01:27:43.711
How the hell do
we have a way out?

01:27:43.755 --> 01:27:45.626
- Have you ever been
to Rockland County?

01:27:45.670 --> 01:27:47.236
Little town called Abaddon?

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.630
Just north of the GW,
right along the Hudson?

01:27:49.674 --> 01:27:51.937
- No, why would I
have ever been there?

01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:53.808
- Because there's a hotel
there called the Abaddon Hotel

01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:55.593
and it's completely vacant.

01:27:56.768 --> 01:27:57.551
- And?

01:27:59.335 --> 01:28:00.685
What do you want, start
a bed and breakfast?

01:28:00.728 --> 01:28:02.208
- No, Mack, that's
where Hell House

01:28:02.251 --> 01:28:03.905
is gonna get its second life.

01:28:33.979 --> 01:28:36.024
Look the rest of them are
gonna be here any minute, okay?

01:28:36.068 --> 01:28:37.939
I just need you to promise me
you won't tell them anything

01:28:37.983 --> 01:28:39.506
about what happened.

01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:42.117
Nobody can know why
we're leaving the city.

01:28:42.161 --> 01:28:43.423
All right, we go
to Rockland County,

01:28:43.467 --> 01:28:45.294
we do our haunt there
and if we're successful,

01:28:45.338 --> 01:28:47.383
we'll be back in New
York next Halloween.

01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:50.430
- Have you even looked
at the contract?

01:28:50.474 --> 01:28:52.084
- Yes I've looked
at the contract.

01:28:53.346 --> 01:28:54.565
- I feel like you probably
got us into something

01:28:54.608 --> 01:28:56.262
we're never gonna get out of.

01:28:56.305 --> 01:28:57.785
- Would you just trust me, Mack?

01:28:57.829 --> 01:29:00.353
This hotel's gonna
be perfect for us.

01:29:00.396 --> 01:29:02.355
I just need you to
back me up, all right?

01:29:03.225 --> 01:29:05.271
- They're here.
- Dude, just,

01:29:05.314 --> 01:29:07.926
I'm serious, back me up, okay?

01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:10.537
Just do this for me.

01:29:10.581 --> 01:29:12.191
- Hey.
- What's up?

01:29:13.305 --> 01:29:19.738
