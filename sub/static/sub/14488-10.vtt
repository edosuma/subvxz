WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.252
Tonight at 11:00...

00:03.337 --> 00:05.797
(SHOUTING)
Doom!

00:26.819 --> 00:29.153
Boy, that thing's big.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.572
Fry, is my colossal eye
too big?

00:31.824 --> 00:34.200
No, it's what
makes you you.

00:34.284 --> 00:37.537
But it's so round,
so hideously round.

00:37.621 --> 00:39.038
Leela, listen.

00:39.123 --> 00:42.041
You're the most
beautiful woman
I've ever known.

00:42.126 --> 00:44.544
Oh. So you only care
about my looks?

00:44.628 --> 00:46.129
No, I... What?

00:46.213 --> 00:49.632
Finally, New New York
got a blast of class today

00:49.800 --> 00:53.469
as Nikolai, playboy ruler
of the Robo-Hungarian Empire,

00:53.554 --> 00:56.848
arrived aboard
his extravagant
caviar-powered yacht.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.975
I am just
a humble emperor

00:59.184 --> 01:01.227
with a big,
big crown!

01:01.729 --> 01:04.188
Of course
I'm not planning to
steal that crown!

01:04.272 --> 01:05.606
What?
True.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.775
I've always dreamed
of being an emperor.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.194
You know, for Halloween,
and then forever.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.822
But heisting those jewels
would be difficult.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.407
You'd be stupid to try.

01:14.491 --> 01:15.783
I'll need accomplices.

01:15.868 --> 01:18.369
A sexy vamp to distract
and tie up the guard.

01:18.454 --> 01:19.620
Never!

01:20.289 --> 01:22.707
A claw man to slip past
the metal detector

01:22.791 --> 01:24.250
and cut the alarm wires.

01:24.334 --> 01:27.420
Sorry,
I'm set for life
after that last job.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.967
And finally, a chump,

01:33.051 --> 01:35.178
to be caught on video
and later arrested.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.305
As I told you on
Sucker-Punch Day,

01:37.389 --> 01:38.681
I'm through being a chump.

01:39.183 --> 01:42.518
Of course,
it would all require
split-second robotic timing.

01:42.603 --> 01:46.063
That's where I come in.
You see, I own a watch.

01:48.901 --> 01:52.945
There. This time I'm sure
I've fixed the mind switcher.

01:53.030 --> 01:56.324
Good, I'm sick of
cleaning up those heaps
of dead monkeys.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.576
But why would
you want your mind
in a new body?

01:58.786 --> 02:01.954
Well, as a man
enters his 18th decade,

02:02.039 --> 02:04.791
he thinks back
on the mistakes
he's made in life.

02:05.209 --> 02:06.626
Like the heaps
of dead monkeys?

02:06.877 --> 02:09.628
Science cannot move forward
without heaps!

02:09.713 --> 02:13.841
No, what I regret
is the youth I wasted
playing it safe.

02:14.176 --> 02:16.719
I wasted my
youth porking out.

02:16.929 --> 02:18.387
Yes, I remember.

02:19.765 --> 02:21.140
Would you please
take that down?

02:21.225 --> 02:22.475
It's making me hungry.

02:22.559 --> 02:26.229
Funny, I could use
a little extra meat
on my bones.

02:26.730 --> 02:27.814
Wait a second!

02:27.898 --> 02:31.818
If we switched bodies,
I could live life
to the extreme,

02:31.902 --> 02:34.403
and you could indulge
your demonic food lust.

02:34.571 --> 02:38.783
(GASPS) We're just the people
this mind switcher was
made for by us!

02:41.495 --> 02:43.621
Wait, can I still
change my mind?

02:43.705 --> 02:44.914
Let's find out.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.340
(IN AMY'S VOICE)
It didn't work, you
doddering old... (GASPS)

02:55.050 --> 02:56.843
(IN FARNSWORTH'S VOICE)
Ah! Cartilage!

02:56.927 --> 02:59.971
Dude, I bid you
a fond cowabunga.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.640
I'm off to laugh
at the Reaper.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.103
(WHOOPING)

03:08.313 --> 03:10.648
Look out, world,
here I... (GROANS)

03:15.195 --> 03:18.364
I'm sorry, Amy,
but your body's
not up to the task.

03:18.615 --> 03:22.368
Also,
I don't care for these boobs
flapping every which way.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.995
Now, quit your
bologna-gargling

03:24.079 --> 03:26.664
and let's switch back
into our original bodies.

03:27.165 --> 03:30.835
Body-switching, eh?
Mayhap the heist is back on.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.629
Who needs accomplices,
if I can just
use their bodies?

03:34.840 --> 03:36.424
(DEVICE BEEPING)

03:39.136 --> 03:41.429
Professor,
what's not happening?

03:41.597 --> 03:43.347
Bad news, me.

03:43.432 --> 03:46.934
I failed to take into account
the cerebral immune response.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.185
You idiot!

03:48.520 --> 03:50.938
Once two bodies
have switched minds,

03:51.023 --> 03:53.149
they can never
switch back.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.819
However,
perhaps they can.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.780
Maybe we can swap back
using a third body

03:59.865 --> 04:01.782
for temporary storage space.

04:02.034 --> 04:04.243
I'm 60% storage space.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.330
You are?
I... Mmm?

04:10.334 --> 04:12.001
(IN BENDER'S VOICE)
Well, I'm off to
the royal yacht

04:12.085 --> 04:13.669
for a quick
seduce-and-snatch.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.755
See you!
(IN FARNSWORTH'S VOICE)
Now, then, Amy

04:15.839 --> 04:18.382
we'll simply switch bodies,
and then we'll...

04:18.466 --> 04:19.466
We'll...

04:19.551 --> 04:21.719
No, I'd be back
in my body,

04:21.803 --> 04:23.721
but then you and Bender
would be switched.

04:23.805 --> 04:28.100
And the Amy and Bender bodies
can't trade minds again,
since they just did.

04:28.352 --> 04:29.602
Oh, no!

04:29.686 --> 04:31.228
Is it possible to
get everyone back

04:31.313 --> 04:33.439
to normal using
four or more bodies?

04:33.523 --> 04:34.649
I'm not sure.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.692
I'm afraid we need to use

04:37.319 --> 04:38.361
math.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.869
Stupid air-needing lungs.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.456
(GASPS) The crown jewels.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.417
Now I just have
to locate the guard
and seduce him in...

04:54.044 --> 04:55.169
Four seconds?

04:55.295 --> 04:56.420
GUARD: Who goes there?

04:56.505 --> 04:58.422
Three, two, one.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.633
(IN FEMALE VOICE)
Hello, big boy.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.259
(IMITATING EROTIC MUSIC)

05:03.136 --> 05:04.971
Silence!
I am Basil,

05:05.055 --> 05:07.431
the Emperor's cousin
and chief of his royal guard.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.392
And I shall not
be seduced by a...

05:10.560 --> 05:11.644
I said...

05:11.728 --> 05:13.396
(IMITATING EROTIC MUSIC)

05:16.650 --> 05:17.650
(GROANING)

05:17.734 --> 05:19.360
(MUTTERING)

05:19.444 --> 05:21.070
Professor?
What's the matter?

05:21.405 --> 05:24.532
I'm Amy.
The Professor and I
switched bodies.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.658
Oh, lord.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.494
All I wanted was to
gorge myself a little,

05:28.578 --> 05:31.163
but I can't digest anything
with these false teeth

05:31.248 --> 05:33.040
and this hit-or-miss colon.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.543
At least you get
a senior discount
at the movies.

05:35.627 --> 05:39.839
I hate paying $14
to see Nicolas Cage
solve things.

05:39.923 --> 05:43.050
If you want to save $2,
we could switch bodies.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.220
Hmm. We can always
switch back, right?

05:47.097 --> 05:48.264
(GIGGLES INNOCENTLY)

05:52.102 --> 05:53.102
Hey, Leela.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.229
Mmm.
What smells saturated?

05:55.313 --> 05:58.941
Deep-fried ice cream sandwich
wrapped in frosting
and lightly baconed.

05:59.151 --> 06:01.944
Whoa. That sounds
like something Amy
would say and eat.

06:02.237 --> 06:05.740
I am Amy. Leela and I
used the Professor's
mind-switching machine.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.325
So Leela's
in your body?

06:08.952 --> 06:09.994
(IN LEELA'S VOICE)
Not exactly.

06:10.162 --> 06:11.162
(EXCLAIMS IN FEAR)

06:11.371 --> 06:14.165
Aha! You do only
like me for my body!

06:14.583 --> 06:16.917
That is entirely
not true, sir!

06:17.294 --> 06:18.753
(MUFFLED GROANS)

06:19.671 --> 06:23.424
Now to go switch
bodies with Zoidberg,
sneak past the metal detector

06:23.508 --> 06:25.843
and clip the alarm wires,
all in less than...

06:26.428 --> 06:28.846
Ten minutes ago? Oh!

06:29.222 --> 06:30.264
(BEEPING)

06:30.348 --> 06:31.766
(ALARM SOUNDING)

06:35.437 --> 06:38.397
Uh, could you come back
when my chump gets here?

06:42.611 --> 06:46.113
Now, then,
what is a filthy human doing
aboard my royal yacht?

06:46.198 --> 06:49.492
With all due respect,
Your Majesty,
I'm a robot like you.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.702
I just switched bodies
with some bimbo.

06:51.787 --> 06:54.371
Go ahead, ask me something
only a robot would know.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.999
A reverse Turing Test, eh?
Very good.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.584
What is the square root
of nine?

06:58.668 --> 07:01.170
Uh, hold on, let me
just get out a pencil.

07:01.797 --> 07:06.008
(SIGHS) Okay, look,
I'm not that kind of robot.
I'm more this kind of robot.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.760
(BEAT BOXING)

07:08.095 --> 07:11.013
He steps forwards
but moves backwards.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.349
By the gods!
He is a machine!

07:15.102 --> 07:17.853
No, that won't
restore everyone, either.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.524
Besides, I don't want
my decrepit old body back!

07:21.608 --> 07:26.195
I'm running away with
this invincible robot body
and joining something.

07:30.742 --> 07:34.703
Look,
I paid for 15 robot clowns
per cubic meter of car,

07:34.788 --> 07:38.749
and you're
barely giving me 12.
Now, crumple up and get in...

07:38.834 --> 07:40.292
And fasten your seatbelts.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.002
(ALL GROANING)
Come on!

07:43.046 --> 07:44.213
Good day.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.633
I am Nonchalanto,
the robot daredevil.

07:47.717 --> 07:52.680
And my dream is to
risk my life in strange
and original ways.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.307
Hmm. You don't look
so foolhardy to me.

08:05.777 --> 08:06.986
(APPLAUSE)

08:07.529 --> 08:10.030
That's the dumbest thing
anybody's ever done.

08:10.407 --> 08:11.657
You're hired!

08:16.079 --> 08:17.872
So you're a common
bending robot,

08:17.956 --> 08:19.623
with a human
peasant roommate?

08:19.708 --> 08:22.334
Oh, crap,
that is what I am!

08:22.419 --> 08:24.378
No, Bender, I envy you.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.755
I'm so bored
with all these
pretentious trappings.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.508
The jewels, the parties,
the beautiful robo-women.

08:29.593 --> 08:30.759
Hello.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.639
(SCOFFS) My fiancée,
Princess Flavia.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.643
Dearest, meet Bender.
He's a robot in the body of
a Chinese Martian physicist.

08:39.895 --> 08:41.770
How tedious.

08:41.938 --> 08:45.316
Oh, to escape this
gilded cage for a day.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.360
You know,
we could trade bodies.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.487
I could take over
the humdrum royal stuff,

08:50.572 --> 08:52.281
and you could be
a regular Joe for a day.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.409
Or more. Much more.

08:55.493 --> 08:59.496
In that horrid
non-robot body?
Sir, I have my standards.

08:59.706 --> 09:03.751
Ah, but what if I could
put you in my fabulous
bending-robot body?

09:04.044 --> 09:07.630
(GIGGLES) Me, posing
as a lowly bending unit?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.048
How wicked!

09:09.507 --> 09:12.801
But wait, I'm supposed
to give a speech
at the U. N. Tomorrow.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.220
Can I trust you to do it?

09:14.346 --> 09:15.679
You can trust anything.

09:20.477 --> 09:21.977
So now Leela's
all crotchety

09:22.062 --> 09:25.022
because she thinks
I'm not attracted to her
in the Professor's body.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.149
You aren't, are you?
Of course not!

09:27.234 --> 09:30.361
But I was willing
to lie about it.
What more can a man do?

09:30.445 --> 09:32.780
A man can give her a toke
of her own medicine.

09:33.031 --> 09:35.908
Yes! I could put my mind
into a hideous body

09:35.992 --> 09:38.202
and show Leela she's
not attracted to me.

09:38.578 --> 09:42.498
But it would have to be
a really, really
disgusting body.

09:42.832 --> 09:46.669
Friends! Friends!
I've got barnacles
on my tuchus.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.338
The long search is over.

09:49.965 --> 09:53.050
Wait here and earn interest
while I find my robot body.

09:56.554 --> 09:57.554
Professor?

09:57.639 --> 09:58.931
Leela. Amy?

09:59.015 --> 10:00.766
Bender.
Have you seen my body?

10:00.850 --> 10:02.017
I think
the Professor's in it.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.728
Yeah, he said something
about running away.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.063
Then he ran away.

10:06.189 --> 10:07.273
What? Whither?

10:19.202 --> 10:20.244
What am I gonna do?

10:20.328 --> 10:22.788
I got an emperor
all patsied up to
switch bodies,

10:22.872 --> 10:24.123
but only with
another robot!

10:24.457 --> 10:25.833
Washbucket full.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.668
Scruffy's work here
is done.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.802
(CHUCKLING)

10:36.886 --> 10:38.971
(CACKLING)

10:39.055 --> 10:41.598
(IN BENDER'S VOICE)
Now to find Emperor
Von Richendoof.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.225
Now to find Scruffy.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.938
Switch bodies?
I don't see why not.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.399
I also don't see why.

10:51.568 --> 10:52.860
(CHUCKLING)

10:52.944 --> 10:54.528
(IN FRY'S VOICE)
In your face, Leela.

10:54.863 --> 10:58.824
If you're a bender,
why is your body
full of fetid water?

10:58.908 --> 11:00.868
If you're an emperor,
why don't you shut up?

11:01.244 --> 11:02.328
Move it, Fry!

11:05.081 --> 11:06.832
Well, so long.
Wait!

11:06.916 --> 11:08.500
Point me to my
normal human roommate!

11:08.585 --> 11:10.127
That's him there.
Maybe.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.545
Got to go!

11:12.756 --> 11:14.006
(IN DR. ZOIDBERG'S VOICE)
Robot?

11:14.132 --> 11:16.592
Yes, 'tis I, Bender.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.886
Do you not recognize
your own best friend?

11:19.095 --> 11:21.930
Aha! The guy in this body
has a friend!

11:22.307 --> 11:25.934
Bender, old pal!
It's me, the Fry!

11:28.271 --> 11:31.774
But then Nicolas Cage
