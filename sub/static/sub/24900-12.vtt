Keep up, bowhead.
I don't want to be late

00:34.068 --> 00:38.348
for the deathball
"State of Smash" address...

00:40.385 --> 00:44.078
Wow!

00:44.113 --> 00:47.254
I've never seen this many people
in a sewer before.

00:47.288 --> 00:49.187
We always meet
in the sewer.

00:49.221 --> 00:51.292
It's deathball
tradition.

00:51.327 --> 00:54.399
Dude, every deathball team
in town's here!

00:54.433 --> 00:56.056
There's the Bad Kittens!

00:56.090 --> 00:58.058
And the Grumble Bees!

00:58.092 --> 01:00.646
Oh!
There's the Lazy Susans!

01:00.681 --> 01:04.132
We'll get to it later.

01:04.167 --> 01:05.824
Buttercup!

01:05.858 --> 01:08.585
I'll have to interview them all
for my student documentary.

01:08.620 --> 01:09.897
Oops!

01:09.931 --> 01:10.794
I'm sorry!

01:10.829 --> 01:14.315
Oh, you will be,
dork-u-tante.

01:18.008 --> 01:21.081
Forgot to check your ball in,
Tess?

01:21.115 --> 01:22.254
Ha ha.

01:22.289 --> 01:24.394
Tell your girl to watch it,
Maylyn.

01:24.429 --> 01:26.983
Come on, Grease Monkeys,
let's roll.

01:30.055 --> 01:31.850
Way to go!

01:31.884 --> 01:35.302
You almost got your butt handed
to you by the Grease Monkeys!

01:35.336 --> 01:38.408
Um, I think I can handle
a few dodge balls.

01:38.443 --> 01:39.685
Deathballs!

01:39.720 --> 01:41.480
And if you get hit
with one of those here,

01:41.515 --> 01:44.449
you're out --
forever!

01:44.483 --> 01:46.934
So you can't play deathball
ever again?

01:46.968 --> 01:48.453
That's a stupid rule.

01:48.487 --> 01:50.593
There are
no stupid rules!

01:50.627 --> 01:52.802
It's deathball!

01:52.836 --> 01:55.184
- I'm gonna get a better shot.

01:57.186 --> 01:59.291
Thrashers...

01:59.326 --> 02:02.536
bashers,
and head smashers --

02:02.570 --> 02:09.991
welcome your deathball big boss,
Smashley Stevens!

02:13.202 --> 02:19.208
Deathballers, can you smash it?!

02:21.210 --> 02:24.627
Who knew deathball had
so much production value?

02:24.661 --> 02:26.629
I heard Smashley was gonna
make some changes

02:26.663 --> 02:28.286
to the deathball
rule book.

02:28.320 --> 02:29.356
No way!

02:29.390 --> 02:31.185
Deathball is perfect!

02:31.220 --> 02:32.980
She'd never
change anything!

02:33.014 --> 02:38.365
We all know deathball is
an amazing game.

02:38.399 --> 02:40.643
But I think it's time...

02:40.677 --> 02:42.921
time for a change.

02:46.511 --> 02:48.237
Wait a second...

02:50.239 --> 02:51.999
Whoa, whoa -- wait!

02:52.033 --> 02:54.726
And that big change
will be --

02:54.760 --> 02:56.106
Whoa!

03:04.977 --> 03:06.255
Hey!

03:06.289 --> 03:07.566
I saw you!

03:07.601 --> 03:10.500
The Derbytantes --
they did it!

03:10.535 --> 03:12.226
They took out Smashley!

03:13.158 --> 03:15.091
What?!
She's lying!

03:17.438 --> 03:19.751
Tell it to the judge!

03:19.785 --> 03:22.132
Okay.
Who's the judge?

03:25.239 --> 03:26.792
I am!

03:41.393 --> 03:44.983
Bobby Suze Raelyn!

03:45.017 --> 03:46.536
Get ready to fight!

03:46.571 --> 03:48.158
Get ready to run!

03:52.577 --> 03:54.268
Way to go!

03:54.303 --> 03:55.545
In deathball culture,

03:55.580 --> 03:57.823
we just did the worst thing
you can do --

03:57.858 --> 03:59.169
run away!

03:59.204 --> 04:01.931
Are you kidding me?
I just saved you.

04:01.965 --> 04:03.312
Pfff, whatever.

04:03.346 --> 04:04.727
Look, we're innocent.

04:04.761 --> 04:06.832
The Grease Monkeys
attacked Smashley --

04:06.867 --> 04:08.938
and I got it all
on tape.

04:08.972 --> 04:12.459
Nice!
I guess nerds are useful.

04:12.493 --> 04:15.151
Let's show them the tape
and prove our innocence.

04:15.185 --> 04:17.084
We just need
a VCR player.

04:17.118 --> 04:21.468
I know -- the Mayor has
one of those fancy doo-dads.

04:21.502 --> 04:24.194
Welcome to Pickle Flicks
movie night!

04:24.229 --> 04:27.612
Using one of my --
whoo-hoo-hoo -- doo-dads,

04:27.646 --> 04:30.131
we'll be watching
tonight's featurette --

04:30.166 --> 04:31.616
"License to Dill,"

04:31.650 --> 04:37.207
a tale of a pickle maker
and the spy who loved him.

04:41.142 --> 04:42.316
Sweet!

04:42.351 --> 04:45.146
No, no, no, Barry.
It's dill.

04:45.181 --> 04:48.771
Dude, City Hall is
all the way across town!

04:48.805 --> 04:51.291
We'll have to skate through
enemy deathball territory!

04:51.325 --> 04:54.121
And without any deathballs,
we're sitting ducks!

04:54.155 --> 04:56.951
No problem. We'll just fly
and be there in a jiffy.

04:56.986 --> 04:59.816
No!
That's not the deathball way.

04:59.851 --> 05:03.199
Derbytantes don't fly,
we skate.

05:03.233 --> 05:05.235
Let's roll, ladies.

05:07.479 --> 05:10.310
The deathball way.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.312
Great.

05:16.557 --> 05:20.837
This is
Kimono Dragon territory.

05:23.702 --> 05:26.015
Stay sharp.

05:34.920 --> 05:36.612
What was that?

05:38.890 --> 05:40.581
Haylyn!

05:40.616 --> 05:42.790
Dragons.

05:45.517 --> 05:47.347
Take cover!

05:54.802 --> 05:57.495
For Smashley's honor!

05:57.529 --> 05:59.945
Bubbles,
I'll set, you spike!

06:13.580 --> 06:15.202
Touchdown.

06:15.236 --> 06:17.515
Now, that's the biggest pickle
I've ever seen.

06:17.549 --> 06:20.587
Hey, that is the biggest pickle
I've ever seen!

06:23.072 --> 06:27.041
The Derbytantes come through
here, they're taters and toast!

06:27.076 --> 06:29.975
- Yeah!
- For Smashley!

06:30.010 --> 06:32.426
It's the Dinettes.

06:32.461 --> 06:33.945
This is gonna get ugly.

06:33.979 --> 06:35.878
Can't we just
go talk to them,

06:35.912 --> 06:39.053
or is that not
the deathball way?

06:39.088 --> 06:42.263
Sure. You want to talk
to the Dinettes?

06:42.298 --> 06:43.610
Go ahead.

06:43.644 --> 06:45.405
Fine, I will.

06:46.682 --> 06:47.648
Excuse me!

06:47.683 --> 06:49.305
Hi.
Hey.

06:49.339 --> 06:51.272
I come in peace.
My name is Blossom,

06:51.307 --> 06:53.482
and I'm with the Derbytantes.
And I--

06:53.516 --> 06:55.484
Now!Huh?!

06:55.518 --> 06:56.830
Quick --
while they're distracted

06:56.864 --> 06:58.556
by Blossom's
stupid diplomacy.

07:00.489 --> 07:02.283
Order up, ladies!

07:02.318 --> 07:04.113
Huh?!

07:07.461 --> 07:09.325
Who wants some?!

07:10.947 --> 07:12.086
Bubbles!

07:12.121 --> 07:13.156
Cold...

07:13.191 --> 07:15.296
I'm so cold.

07:15.331 --> 07:17.264
Why don't you
zip up your jacket?

07:17.298 --> 07:19.128
Oh, yeah!

07:19.162 --> 07:20.094
Mmm!

07:20.129 --> 07:22.096
Time for seconds!

07:23.719 --> 07:26.756
Regroup!

07:26.791 --> 07:29.587
Bloss, Maylyn --
get to City Hall.

07:29.621 --> 07:30.760
I'll hold 'em off!

07:30.795 --> 07:32.762
Buttlynn,
we're not leaving you!

07:32.797 --> 07:34.454
Don't worry,
old friend.

07:34.488 --> 07:35.627
We'll meet again...

07:35.662 --> 07:36.973
in a better place.

07:37.008 --> 07:39.320
Aren't we all going bowling
tomorrow?

07:39.355 --> 07:42.392
Exactly.

07:42.427 --> 07:44.291
Ha!

07:49.158 --> 07:51.540
Looks like we're in
quite the pickle.

07:51.574 --> 07:54.025
Oh, be careful, Jed.

07:54.059 --> 07:55.889
All right,
the coast is clear.

07:55.923 --> 07:58.788
Now all we have to do is
get the tape to the VCR

07:58.823 --> 08:00.307
and prove our innocence --

08:00.341 --> 08:02.827
Derbytantes,

08:02.861 --> 08:05.381
come out and play!

08:05.415 --> 08:08.418
I don't remember this part,
but I like it!

08:08.453 --> 08:11.491
We know you took out Smashley,
and you're gonna pay!

08:11.525 --> 08:14.873
I'm gonna take care of this --
once and for all!

08:14.908 --> 08:17.013
No!
If you fight Tess,

08:17.048 --> 08:19.326
there's no way
you'll make it out of there.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.535
Who cares about
the deathball way?

08:21.570 --> 08:22.812
I care!

08:22.847 --> 08:25.574
It may be weird,
it may be dumb,

08:25.608 --> 08:28.335
but the deathball way
is my way!

08:28.369 --> 08:30.717
You got to
believe in something.

08:30.751 --> 08:33.720
And this is it for me.

08:33.754 --> 08:36.688
Deathball! Deathball! Deathball!

08:38.379 --> 08:40.347
I didn't think
you had the guts!

08:40.381 --> 08:44.524
Ha! You gonna talk all night,
or are we gonna dance?

08:52.324 --> 08:53.360
Draw!

09:00.229 --> 09:01.713
Huh?!

09:04.992 --> 09:08.582
Do it!
Deathball rules mean no mercy!

09:08.617 --> 09:10.722
It's the deathball way!

09:12.724 --> 09:16.210
Deathball rules
aren't perfect.

09:19.006 --> 09:21.077
Hear me,
deathball sisters!

09:21.112 --> 09:23.977
Deathball is great,
but at what cost?

09:24.011 --> 09:26.048
We've lost too many friends.

09:26.082 --> 09:28.326
Too much juice has been spilt.

09:28.360 --> 09:32.572
We can change the rules
without changing who we are.

09:32.606 --> 09:33.952
Don't listen to her!

09:33.987 --> 09:36.472
She just saying that
'cause she took out Smashley!

09:36.506 --> 09:38.060
-That's a lie!
-Huh?

09:38.094 --> 09:40.787
And I'll prove it!

09:50.279 --> 09:51.314
Whoa!

09:52.453 --> 09:53.731
It was Tess!

09:53.765 --> 09:55.664
She took out Smashley!

09:57.804 --> 09:59.909
No!
I did it for us!

09:59.944 --> 10:01.739
She was gonna change everything.

10:01.773 --> 10:02.912
I'll show you!

10:02.947 --> 10:04.742
I'll show you all!

10:07.296 --> 10:09.091
Case closed.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.093
Listen up,
deathballers!

10:11.127 --> 10:15.166
I hereby declare
a new rule!

10:15.200 --> 10:18.652
Out-sies are
no longer permanent!

10:18.687 --> 10:24.451
You can now undo out-sies
if you tap-sies twice-sies!

10:24.485 --> 10:26.349
Who's with me?

10:27.661 --> 10:30.284
This is
the best movie ever!

10:30.319 --> 10:34.012
Now that we've all
tapsied twicies,

10:34.047 --> 10:36.946
I'd like to thank
the Derbytantes --

10:36.981 --> 10:38.638
for their heroism

10:38.672 --> 10:42.296
and for making deathball
stronger than ever!

10:42.331 --> 10:44.298
And now for the announcement

10:44.333 --> 10:46.784
I was going to say earlier...

10:50.097 --> 10:52.513
Wash ya jerseys, people!

10:52.548 --> 10:55.240
It smells worse than a sewer
in here --

10:55.275 --> 10:58.140
and we're actually in the sewer!

10:58.174 --> 10:59.210
Yay!

10:59.244 --> 11:02.109
See?
Change can be good.
