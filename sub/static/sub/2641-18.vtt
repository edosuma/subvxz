WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:04.411
Okay in Avatar when
they gave sex in Pandora

00:04.691 --> 00:07.126
they hook up their ponytails,
so we know their ponytails

00:07.160 --> 00:09.862
are like their junk.

00:09.896 --> 00:11.497
Yeah... so?

00:11.531 --> 00:13.665
So, when they ride horses
and fly on the birds,

00:13.700 --> 00:15.034
they also use their ponytails.

00:15.068 --> 00:16.235
What's your point?

00:16.268 --> 00:18.637
My point is,
if I were a horse or a bird,

00:18.671 --> 00:20.873
I'd be very nervous
around James Cameron.

00:22.008 --> 00:24.676
It amazes me
how you constantly obsess

00:24.711 --> 00:26.145
over fictional details

00:26.179 --> 00:27.746
when there
are more important things

00:27.781 --> 00:29.114
in the real world
to worry about.

00:29.149 --> 00:30.382
For example,
why wasn't William Shatner

00:30.417 --> 00:32.683
in the new <i>Star Trek</i> movie?

00:33.586 --> 00:34.586
Hey, Sheldon.

00:34.621 --> 00:36.055
I was up in the
administration office,

00:36.089 --> 00:37.423
and I happened
to overhear

00:37.457 --> 00:38.757
the name of the winner

00:38.792 --> 00:41.126
of this year's
Chancellor's Award for Science.

00:41.161 --> 00:43.195
And you want to rub
my nose in the fact

00:43.229 --> 00:45.064
that my contributions
are being overlooked again?

00:45.098 --> 00:47.766
I am the William Shatner
of theoretical physics.

00:49.135 --> 00:50.169
All right, I'll play.

00:50.203 --> 00:51.770
What self-important,
preening fraud

00:51.805 --> 00:53.338
are they honoring this year?

00:53.373 --> 00:55.908
Oh, I'm so glad you asked it
like that. You.

00:58.244 --> 00:59.945
I won?
You won.

00:59.979 --> 01:02.381
I won!

01:02.415 --> 01:04.183
This is astonishing.

01:04.217 --> 01:06.785
Not that I won the award--
no one deserves it more.

01:06.820 --> 01:08.353
Actually, I guess I misspoke.

01:08.388 --> 01:10.322
It's not astonishing;
more like inevitable.

01:11.758 --> 01:13.192
I'm not sure what to do first.

01:13.226 --> 01:14.626
Maybe I should call my mother.

01:14.661 --> 01:16.562
Wait! I know-- I'm going
to conduct an interview

01:16.596 --> 01:18.063
with myself and post it online.

01:21.167 --> 01:22.868
Well, good for him.

01:22.902 --> 01:25.771
Yeah, the one thing
the William Shatner

01:25.805 --> 01:29.875
of theoretical physics needed
was an ego boost.

02:13.272 --> 02:14.972
Didn't it look
like that spear

02:15.007 --> 02:17.108
was going to go
right through your skull?

02:17.142 --> 02:18.576
No.

02:20.112 --> 02:21.879
Hey, you didn't want a Slurpee
at 7-Eleven,

02:21.914 --> 02:23.514
you don't get glasses.

02:26.552 --> 02:29.454
Oh, that will be another
congratulatory call for me.

02:29.488 --> 02:31.189
Uh, mute, please.

02:31.223 --> 02:33.424
Wait, wait. Hang on--
flaming arrow.

02:36.695 --> 02:38.129
Hello?

02:38.163 --> 02:40.965
Oh, Chancellor Morton,
how are you, sir?

02:42.935 --> 02:44.669
Yes, I was expecting your call.

02:44.703 --> 02:46.504
Three years ago.

02:47.372 --> 02:48.739
I see.

02:48.774 --> 02:51.742
Wait. What happens if I choose
not to give a speech?

02:51.777 --> 02:53.411
Uh-huh.

02:53.445 --> 02:56.047
And if I don't want
to forfeit the award?

02:57.216 --> 03:00.117
Well, you've got that tied up
in a neat little bow.

03:00.152 --> 03:01.185
All right.

03:01.220 --> 03:02.787
Thank you.

03:02.821 --> 03:04.155
Problem.

03:04.189 --> 03:05.623
What?

03:05.657 --> 03:08.359
They expect me to give a speech
at the banquet.

03:08.393 --> 03:09.961
I can't give a speech.

03:09.995 --> 03:11.762
Well, no,
you're mistaken.

03:11.797 --> 03:14.866
You give speeches
all the time.

03:16.802 --> 03:20.037
What you can't
do is shut up.

03:20.072 --> 03:21.806
Yeah, before the movie,

03:21.840 --> 03:26.177
you did 20 minutes
on why guacamole turns brown.

03:26.211 --> 03:28.913
It turned brown
while you were talking.

03:28.947 --> 03:31.849
I am perfectly comfortable
speaking to small groups.

03:31.884 --> 03:34.018
I cannot speak to large crowds.

03:34.052 --> 03:35.520
What, to you, is a large crowd?

03:35.554 --> 03:38.022
Any group big enough
to trample me to death.

03:39.391 --> 03:43.427
General rule of thumb
is 36 adults or 70 children.

03:43.462 --> 03:46.464
Sheldon, congratulations.

03:46.498 --> 03:48.132
Brought you a cheesecake
from work.

03:48.166 --> 03:49.634
You know, 'cause of your award,

03:49.668 --> 03:51.469
not because a busboy sneezed
on it.

03:54.573 --> 03:57.308
I'm not accepting the award.
Why not?

03:57.342 --> 04:01.012
Turns out the great Sheldon
Cooper has stage fright.

04:01.046 --> 04:02.213
That's no reason to back out.

04:02.247 --> 04:04.115
You know, I once got
a pretty big honor

04:04.149 --> 04:05.816
in high school,
and I was terrified

04:05.851 --> 04:07.451
about appearing
in front of a big crowd,

04:07.486 --> 04:09.654
but I went through with
it, and you know what?

04:09.688 --> 04:11.556
The world
looked pretty darn good

04:11.590 --> 04:14.258
sitting on a haystack
in the back of a Ford F-150

04:14.293 --> 04:17.327
as a member
of the Corn Queen's court.

04:19.363 --> 04:20.363
Thank you.

04:20.399 --> 04:21.699
Yeah, I'll bear that in mind

04:21.733 --> 04:24.368
if I'm ever nominated
for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.

04:26.538 --> 04:28.973
Sheldon,
you're being ridiculous.

04:29.007 --> 04:30.007
Am I?

04:30.042 --> 04:31.342
Let me tell you a story.

04:31.376 --> 04:34.045
Where's 70 children
when you need them?

04:35.247 --> 04:39.884
I was 14 and graduating
summa cum laude from college.

04:39.918 --> 04:43.220
"Summa cum laude" is Latin
for "with highest honors."

04:43.255 --> 04:45.022
I just love how
you always skip

04:45.057 --> 04:47.892
over the part
where no one asks.

04:47.926 --> 04:50.394
I was valedictorian
and expected to give an address.

04:50.462 --> 04:52.663
Even now,
I can remember that moment

04:52.698 --> 04:55.866
when I walked up to the podium
and looked out at the crowd.

04:55.901 --> 04:57.868
There must have been thousands
of people.

04:57.903 --> 05:00.104
My heart started pounding
in my chest.

05:00.138 --> 05:01.672
I began to
hyperventilate.

05:01.707 --> 05:05.343
My vision became blurry,
and before I knew it...

05:05.377 --> 05:07.311
Oh, dear.

05:07.346 --> 05:08.913
Oh, my God.

05:08.947 --> 05:09.981
Sheldon?

05:10.015 --> 05:11.549
Sheldon, are you okay?

05:11.583 --> 05:13.584
Don't trample me.

05:15.887 --> 05:16.988
Come on, Mother.

05:17.022 --> 05:20.024
You know why I can't accept
the award.

05:20.058 --> 05:24.228
With all due respect,
I don't think praying will help.

05:24.262 --> 05:28.332
No, I have not heard the song,
"Jesus, Take the Wheel."

05:28.367 --> 05:29.800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

05:29.835 --> 05:32.336
You don't need
to start singing it.

05:32.371 --> 05:35.539
Yes, I'll buy it
on the iTunes, Mother.

05:35.574 --> 05:37.174
Good-bye, Mother.

05:42.848 --> 05:44.982
Hello.

05:45.017 --> 05:46.050
Sit down.

05:46.084 --> 05:47.318
We want to talk to you.

05:47.352 --> 05:48.653
Am I in trouble?

05:48.687 --> 05:50.554
Did my mother call you?

05:50.589 --> 05:51.956
Just sit.

05:51.990 --> 05:55.626
We think we can help you
with your stage fright.

05:55.661 --> 05:57.261
Oh, I doubt that.

05:57.295 --> 05:58.529
I haven't figured out a way,

05:58.563 --> 06:00.464
and I'm much smarter
than all of you.

06:02.401 --> 06:05.770
Yes, but you're not smarter
than all of us put together.

06:05.804 --> 06:07.038
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:07.072 --> 06:08.873
That is what I meant.

06:09.775 --> 06:11.008
Okay. Your problem is,

06:11.043 --> 06:13.244
you're trying to do this
all by yourself.

06:13.278 --> 06:15.279
We can help you.
We can be your team.

06:15.313 --> 06:18.115
Like, uh, Professor Xavier
and his X-Men.

06:21.720 --> 06:24.488
I do like the X-Men.

06:24.523 --> 06:26.724
Did I see <i>X-Men?</i>

06:26.758 --> 06:28.125
Yeah, we watched it last week.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.360
You said you liked it.

06:29.394 --> 06:31.729
Oh. I say a lot of things,
sweetie.

06:33.465 --> 06:34.965
So, how about it, Sheldon?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.434
I don't know.

06:36.468 --> 06:39.937
If you're my X-Men,
what are your powers?

06:39.971 --> 06:42.239
Okay. Well, I am going
to take you shopping,

06:42.274 --> 06:43.774
get you a nice suit.

06:43.809 --> 06:45.176
Might give you more confidence.

06:45.210 --> 06:47.378
That's not exactly a mutation
that would get you

06:47.412 --> 06:50.314
into Xavier's School for
Gifted Youngsters, but go on.

06:50.348 --> 06:51.615
Leonard?

06:51.650 --> 06:53.684
I thought I could try
to analyze you

06:53.719 --> 06:55.720
and get to the root
of your anxiety.

06:55.754 --> 06:59.090
What qualifies you to attempt
to understand my mind?

06:59.124 --> 07:01.659
My mother is
a highly regarded psychiatrist,

07:01.693 --> 07:04.929
and I've been in therapy
ever since she accused me

07:04.963 --> 07:07.465
of breast-feeding codependently.

07:09.534 --> 07:11.802
Raj says he can
teach you...

07:11.837 --> 07:13.804
What did you call it?

07:13.839 --> 07:17.108
I don't know-- some
Indian meditation crap.

07:18.643 --> 07:19.844
I see.

07:19.878 --> 07:21.812
Well, I assume,
since the rest of you

07:21.847 --> 07:24.181
have set the bar so
low, you're saving

07:24.216 --> 07:25.816
the most impressive contribution
for last.

07:25.851 --> 07:27.151
Go ahead, Howard.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.253
Dazzle me.

07:30.489 --> 07:33.991
My power is the ability
to pretend

07:34.025 --> 07:37.928
like I give a damn
about your piddily-ass problems.

07:42.567 --> 07:45.402
And that's 24-seven, buddy.

07:46.605 --> 07:49.540
And I appreciate
the pretense.

07:50.675 --> 07:51.942
So, what do you say, Sheldon?

07:51.977 --> 07:53.644
Are we your X-Men?

07:53.678 --> 07:54.845
No.

07:54.880 --> 07:58.249
The X-Men were named for the "X"
in Charles Xavier.

07:58.283 --> 08:02.620
Since I am Sheldon Cooper,
you will be my C-Men.

08:07.626 --> 08:09.794
Oh, that's not a good name.

08:14.599 --> 08:16.167
Okay, Sheldon.

08:16.201 --> 08:17.868
I'm going
to be leading you

08:17.903 --> 08:20.070
through a series
of meditation exercises.

08:20.105 --> 08:23.374
These methods come
from the ancient gurus of India

08:23.408 --> 08:26.577
and have helped me
overcome my own fears.

08:27.479 --> 08:30.414
And yet, you can't
speak to women.

08:31.616 --> 08:33.884
True, but thanks to meditation,
I am able to stay

08:33.919 --> 08:35.919
in the same room with them
without urinating.

08:38.623 --> 08:42.058
Now...
close your eyes.

08:42.092 --> 08:44.995
Okay, but don't punch me.

08:45.030 --> 08:46.363
What?

08:46.398 --> 08:48.632
When I was little, my
sister would say to me,

08:48.667 --> 08:50.534
"Close your eyes,
you'll get a surprise,"

08:50.569 --> 08:52.336
and then she'd punch me.

08:52.370 --> 08:54.171
I'm not going to punch you.

08:54.206 --> 08:56.140
That's what my
sister used to say.

08:57.075 --> 08:58.642
Do you want to do this or not?

08:58.677 --> 09:00.444
I'm sorry. Proceed.

09:00.478 --> 09:02.146
All right.

09:02.180 --> 09:04.215
Imagine yourself
in the one place

09:04.249 --> 09:05.983
you feel most at home.

09:06.017 --> 09:07.351
Where is that?

09:07.385 --> 09:10.321
Sim City.

09:11.723 --> 09:15.025
More specifically,
the Sim City I designed--

09:15.060 --> 09:17.094
Sheldonopolis.

09:17.128 --> 09:19.563
Okay, you're
in Sheldonopolis.

09:19.598 --> 09:21.298
Where exactly?

09:21.333 --> 09:23.434
Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers?

09:23.468 --> 09:27.104
Sheldon Stadium,
home of the Fighting Sheldons?

09:27.138 --> 09:28.606
Whatever you like.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.375
I thought this was supposed
to be a guided meditation.

09:31.409 --> 09:34.211
Fine. You're in Sheldon Square.

09:34.246 --> 09:35.412
Really? This time of year?

09:35.447 --> 09:36.814
It's a bit nippy.

09:36.848 --> 09:38.883
Then, put on a sweater.

09:38.917 --> 09:40.818
Suppose I could run downtown

09:40.852 --> 09:44.121
and pick up something
at Shel-Mart.

09:44.155 --> 09:46.090
Yeah, whatever.
Just go buy a sweater.

09:46.124 --> 09:48.425
You know, the nice thing
about Shel-Mart is I own it,

09:48.460 --> 09:50.861
so I get a 15% discount.

09:50.896 --> 09:52.563
You own the damn thing.

09:52.597 --> 09:54.531
Just take a freaking sweater!

09:54.566 --> 09:56.734
Look, I didn't turn a profit
last quarter

09:56.768 --> 09:59.737
by taking product
off the shelves willy-nilly.

09:59.771 --> 10:02.506
All right.

10:02.540 --> 10:06.543
You've paid for a sweater,
and you're in Sheldon Square.

10:06.578 --> 10:08.946
Hang on.

10:10.215 --> 10:12.850
It's a cardigan.
I have to button it.

10:15.754 --> 10:17.121
Oh, no.

10:17.155 --> 10:18.289
What now?

10:18.323 --> 10:21.325
A Godzilla-like monster
is approaching the city.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.661
I have to get my
people to safety.

10:23.695 --> 10:26.864
People of Sheldonopolis,
this is your mayor.

10:26.898 --> 10:28.132
Follow me.

10:28.166 --> 10:31.769
If the children can't run,
leave them behind.

10:33.371 --> 10:36.640
Oh, the simulated horror!

10:45.550 --> 10:47.685
Raj?

10:48.954 --> 10:51.055
Just as I suspected.

10:51.089 --> 10:53.691
Meditation is nothing but hokum.

11:00.825 --> 11:02.525
I question your premise.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.761
How is a new suit going
to prevent me

11:04.795 --> 11:07.063
from passing out in front of
a ballroom full of people?

11:07.098 --> 11:09.065
It'll give you confidence.

11:09.100 --> 11:10.767
You know, sometimes when
I'm feeling all stressed out

11:10.801 --> 11:13.069
about something, I go out
and buy a cute top

11:13.104 --> 11:16.206
or a fun skirt and I have
a whole new outlook on life.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.208
Don't you eventually
realize

11:18.242 --> 11:20.043
you're just the same
stressed out person

11:20.077 --> 11:22.145
in a cute top
or a fun skirt?

11:22.179 --> 11:24.848
Yeah, that's when I buy shoes.

11:25.916 --> 11:27.517
Now, let's see
what we've got.

11:27.551 --> 11:28.685
Ooh!

11:28.719 --> 11:31.087
This is nice.

11:31.122 --> 11:33.990
It's only one color.

11:34.025 --> 11:35.358
Yeah, so?

11:35.393 --> 11:38.561
That's a lot of money
for only one color.

11:38.596 --> 11:39.596
Fine.

11:39.630 --> 11:41.431
Why don't you pick out
what you like.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.834
Hmm.

11:44.869 --> 11:47.003
This is pretty sharp.

11:52.443 --> 11:53.743
No.

11:53.778 --> 11:55.378
You're wrong.

11:56.547 --> 11:58.481
This is great.

11:58.516 --> 12:01.818
I had a suit like this
when I was six.

12:05.656 --> 12:07.791
Okay, I think
we have a winner.

12:10.561 --> 12:12.362
Where the hell'd you find that?

12:12.396 --> 12:14.731
In the prom department.

12:14.765 --> 12:16.132
It's ridiculous.

12:16.167 --> 12:20.070
Says the former member
of the Corn Queen's Court.

12:21.005 --> 12:23.573
Please just try
this one on.

12:23.607 --> 12:24.607
Okay.

12:24.642 --> 12:26.076
But anything I put on now

12:26.110 --> 12:28.478
is only going to suffer
in comparison.

12:34.652 --> 12:36.419
This is absurd.

12:36.454 --> 12:37.821
I look like a clown.

12:41.725 --> 12:44.427
So, Sheldon...

12:46.330 --> 12:48.164
...how you doing?

12:48.199 --> 12:51.801
That's how you start a
psychotherapy session?

12:51.836 --> 12:53.136
"How am I doing?"

12:53.170 --> 12:55.638
I was promised
a riverboat journey

12:55.673 --> 12:57.907
into the jungles
of my subconscious.

12:57.942 --> 12:59.809
Instead, I get the same
question I hear

12:59.844 --> 13:02.979
from the lady who slices
my bologna at Ralph's.

13:03.814 --> 13:06.049
I'm sorry, I'll start again.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.984
Would it be helpful to you

13:08.018 --> 13:10.186
if I told you
about my dreams?

13:10.221 --> 13:12.188
Um, I don't know, maybe.

13:12.223 --> 13:14.524
I recently had a dream

13:14.558 --> 13:16.993
that I was a giant.

13:17.027 --> 13:19.562
But everything around me
was to scale,

13:19.597 --> 13:21.698
so it all looked normal.

13:24.869 --> 13:26.970
How did you know
you were a giant

13:27.004 --> 13:29.005
if everything was to scale?

13:29.039 --> 13:32.575
I was wearing size
a million pants.

13:35.713 --> 13:37.714
Why don't we just talk?

13:37.748 --> 13:38.848
Ah.

13:38.883 --> 13:39.883
The talking cure.

13:39.917 --> 13:41.351
Classical Freudian.
Good choice.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.353
If it will help
speed things along,

13:43.387 --> 13:46.890
uh, my answers to the standard
Rorschach ink blot test are:

13:46.924 --> 13:49.893
A) a bat, B) a bat,

13:49.927 --> 13:51.895
C) a bat,

13:51.929 --> 13:54.197
and D) my father
killing my mother

13:54.231 --> 13:57.333
with a hypodermic needle.

13:58.235 --> 14:00.537
Why don't I just start?

14:00.571 --> 14:02.872
Sometimes

14:02.907 --> 14:05.275
people have trouble
accepting accolades

14:05.309 --> 14:07.210
if, on a subconscious level,

14:07.244 --> 14:09.145
they don't feel
they deserve them.

14:09.180 --> 14:11.347
Do you think maybe that's
what's happening here?

14:11.382 --> 14:13.917
Really, Leonard?

14:15.119 --> 14:17.854
You're just going to try
to recycle Adler's doctrine

14:17.888 --> 14:19.289
of the inferiority complex?

14:19.323 --> 14:22.325
I could probably get that
from the woman at Ralph's.

14:22.359 --> 14:25.762
And she'd let me taste some
pieces of cheese for free.

14:25.796 --> 14:27.697
But it could be part
of your problem.

14:27.731 --> 14:29.098
Let me give you
an example.

14:29.133 --> 14:30.700
When I was eight,

14:30.734 --> 14:32.902
I won a ribbon
at the science fair

14:32.937 --> 14:36.573
for my project, "Do Lima Beans
Grow Better to Classical Music."

14:36.607 --> 14:38.841
But my mother pointed out

14:38.876 --> 14:41.778
that it was just a rehash
of my brother's earlier

14:41.812 --> 14:44.747
"Do Lima Beans Grow Worse
to Rock 'n' Roll."

14:46.283 --> 14:49.986
I felt so guilty,
I gave the ribbon back.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.555
And how did that
make you feel?

14:52.590 --> 14:54.524
Terrible.

14:54.558 --> 14:57.460
I worked really hard
on that project.

14:57.494 --> 15:00.897
I stayed up all night singing
the clown's aria from <i>Pagliacci</i>

15:00.931 --> 15:03.733
to a lima bean sprout.

15:04.668 --> 15:07.203
Go on.

15:07.238 --> 15:09.205
It wasn't my fault.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.808
I had never seen
my brother's project.

15:11.842 --> 15:14.010
And my mother could've
told me before

15:14.044 --> 15:17.247
instead of at the ceremony
in front of everyone.

15:18.215 --> 15:19.315
So, I hear you saying

15:19.350 --> 15:22.652
you're angry
with your mother.

15:22.686 --> 15:25.755
Damn right, I'm angry
with my mother.

15:30.894 --> 15:33.930
For God's sake,
I was eight years old.

15:33.964 --> 15:35.832
She humiliated me.

15:35.866 --> 15:38.735
That's when the bed-wetting
started again.

15:40.671 --> 15:42.405
Thank you, Leonard.

15:42.439 --> 15:43.973
For what?

15:44.008 --> 15:45.775
If someone as damaged as you

15:45.809 --> 15:48.177
can find his way to crawl
out of bed each morning,

15:48.212 --> 15:50.680
I think I can face
a simple award ceremony.

15:51.582 --> 15:53.516
Wait, that's it?

15:53.550 --> 15:56.185
I thought we had a whole hour!

15:57.354 --> 15:59.322
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:59.356 --> 16:01.257
My name is Dr. Leonard
Hofstadter,

16:01.292 --> 16:03.660
and it is my very great honor
to introduce the winner

16:03.694 --> 16:06.162
of this year's Chancellor's
award for Science

16:06.196 --> 16:08.998
and my good friend,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

16:10.301 --> 16:12.302
But before I do,

16:12.336 --> 16:14.904
I'd like to share with you a
letter from Sheldon's mother,

16:14.938 --> 16:17.440
who couldn't be here tonight.

16:17.474 --> 16:19.108
Isn't that nice?

16:19.143 --> 16:21.077
His mother sent him a letter.

16:21.111 --> 16:23.112
She's proud of him.

16:23.147 --> 16:25.982
I wonder what that feels like.

16:26.016 --> 16:27.417
Anyway,

16:27.451 --> 16:29.218
"Dear Shelly."

16:29.253 --> 16:31.554
That's what she calls him.

16:31.588 --> 16:33.489
Shelly-- it's a pet name.

16:33.524 --> 16:35.692
You know what my mother's
pet name for me is?

16:35.726 --> 16:37.026
Leonard.

16:39.263 --> 16:42.498
But I digress.

16:42.533 --> 16:43.566
"Dear Shelly..."

16:43.600 --> 16:45.501
Oh, dear.

16:45.536 --> 16:46.502
What's the matter?

16:46.537 --> 16:47.704
I'm getting dizzy.

16:47.738 --> 16:49.038
Don't worry.

16:49.073 --> 16:51.841
You're surrounded by your C-Men.

16:53.410 --> 16:54.377
I can't do this.

16:54.411 --> 16:55.778
I'm going to faint.

16:55.813 --> 16:56.779
Here, drink this.

16:56.814 --> 16:57.847
It'll relax you.

16:57.881 --> 16:59.048
Alcohol?

16:59.083 --> 17:00.416
I don't drink alcohol.

17:00.451 --> 17:01.851
Fine, faint.

17:05.656 --> 17:07.623
I don't feel different.

17:07.657 --> 17:09.092
This alcohol is defective.

17:09.126 --> 17:12.362
Here, see if
this one works.

17:13.262 --> 17:15.464
First of all,

17:15.499 --> 17:19.502
the projects
were totally different.

17:19.536 --> 17:20.703
I was showing

17:20.738 --> 17:22.672
that classical music nurtures
lima beans

17:22.705 --> 17:24.140
and makes them grow,
but my mother

17:24.174 --> 17:26.041
didn't hear me.

17:26.076 --> 17:27.676
If you'd like to look
at the relationship

17:27.711 --> 17:29.712
between nurturing and growth,
I'd like to point out

17:29.747 --> 17:33.249
that my brother is
eight inches taller than me.

17:33.283 --> 17:35.284
SHELDON
I'm ready.

17:35.319 --> 17:37.754
Oh,

17:37.788 --> 17:39.021
right.

17:39.056 --> 17:41.090
Ladies and gentlemen,
our guest of honor

17:41.125 --> 17:42.792
Dr. Sheldon
Cooper.

17:45.529 --> 17:49.098
Thanks, shorty,
I'll take it from here.

17:49.133 --> 17:51.834
All right, you people ready
to have some fun?

17:51.869 --> 17:52.935
You have a basic

17:52.970 --> 17:54.437
understanding
of differential calculus

17:54.471 --> 17:56.639
and at least one year
of algebraic topology?

17:56.673 --> 17:58.574
Well, then here come the jokes.

18:00.544 --> 18:03.846
Why did the chicken
cross the Mobius strip?

18:03.881 --> 18:06.783
To get to the same side--
bazinga!

18:07.951 --> 18:10.086
All right, a neutron walks
into a bar and asks,

18:10.120 --> 18:11.187
"How much for a drink?"

18:11.221 --> 18:13.322
The bartender says,
"For you, no charge."

18:18.462 --> 18:20.296
Hello?

18:21.198 --> 18:22.298
I know you're out there.

18:22.332 --> 18:24.233
I can hear you
metabolizing oxygen

18:24.268 --> 18:26.636
and expelling carbon dioxide.

18:28.172 --> 18:30.773
Looks like we have some academic
dignitaries in the audience.

18:30.808 --> 18:33.409
Dr. Randall
from the geology department--

18:33.444 --> 18:36.145
only man who's happy when they
take his work for granite.

18:36.180 --> 18:38.314
Ba-da cha!

18:40.083 --> 18:41.984
I kid the geologists,
of course,

18:42.019 --> 18:44.320
but it's only 'cause I have
no respect for the field.

18:45.622 --> 18:48.591
Let's get serious for a moment.

18:52.129 --> 18:54.697
Why are we all here?

18:54.731 --> 18:56.599
'Cause we're scientists.

18:56.633 --> 18:59.535
And what do scientists study?

18:59.570 --> 19:01.270
The universe.

19:01.305 --> 19:03.439
And what's the
universe made of?

19:03.474 --> 19:05.975
I am so glad you asked.

19:06.009 --> 19:08.110
♪ There's antimony ♪

19:08.145 --> 19:09.979
♪ Arsenic, aluminum,
selenium ♪

19:10.013 --> 19:12.281

19:12.316 --> 19:14.817

19:43.391 --> 19:45.726
Penny, Leonard.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.195
Would you be able
to answer some questions

19:48.229 --> 19:51.398
I'm having about
the events of last night?

19:51.433 --> 19:53.033
Sure.

19:53.068 --> 19:55.169
Question one...

19:55.203 --> 19:57.171
where are my pants?

19:57.205 --> 19:59.673
You might want
to check YouTube.

20:01.709 --> 20:03.043
What do I search?

20:03.078 --> 20:05.746
It's already loaded.
Just hit play.

20:07.849 --> 20:11.552
SHELDON
All right, people, let's
get down to the math.

20:11.586 --> 20:13.987
It is only
three dimensional thinking

20:14.022 --> 20:16.256
that limits our imagination.

20:16.291 --> 20:18.625
Can I take my pants
off over my head?

20:18.660 --> 20:20.928
Of course not.

20:20.962 --> 20:22.496
My body's in the way.

20:22.530 --> 20:28.702
But if we had access
to higher dimensions,

20:28.736 --> 20:32.573
we could move our pants
around our bodies

20:32.607 --> 20:35.809
through the fourth dimension

20:35.844 --> 20:39.813
and our days of dropping
trousers would be over.

20:43.218 --> 20:45.018
Oh, Lord...

20:45.053 --> 20:47.554
This couldn't be
any more humiliating.

20:47.589 --> 20:48.655
Give it a minute.

20:48.690 --> 20:50.624
Now, for the astronomers

20:50.658 --> 20:52.526
in the audience,
get ready to see

20:52.560 --> 20:54.461
the dark side of the moon.

20:55.930 --> 20:57.297
And here's Uranus.
