00:01.038 --> 00:02.439
Mm!

00:03.257 --> 00:04.156
I like the lemon.

00:04.724 --> 00:05.425
So good.

00:05.493 --> 00:06.892
And with the vanilla frosting,

00:06.894 --> 00:09.529
it would make a lovely
cupcake wedding cake.

00:09.531 --> 00:10.830
Mm.

00:10.832 --> 00:13.366
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

00:13.368 --> 00:15.334
The chocolate!

00:15.336 --> 00:18.002
You do realize you're not alone, right?

00:18.003 --> 00:19.622
I know.
I'm gonna get some water,

00:19.624 --> 00:21.874
and then I'll be back
to taste <i>everything!</i>

00:23.678 --> 00:27.011
There's no wedding.

00:27.465 --> 00:29.081
- What?
- It's a scam.

00:29.083 --> 00:30.299
I know her game.

00:30.301 --> 00:32.185
There isn't a Denny's
on the Eastern Seaboard

00:32.186 --> 00:33.753
I haven't hit up
and said it's my birthday

00:33.755 --> 00:36.556
for a free sundae.

00:36.558 --> 00:37.640
Well, what if you're wrong,

00:37.642 --> 00:39.058
and she is the real deal?

00:39.060 --> 00:41.093
A cupcake wedding cake
could be a lot of money.

00:41.095 --> 00:42.228
We have to crack her B.S.

00:42.230 --> 00:44.147
Before she eats our cupcakes,
and then <i>us.</i>

00:44.149 --> 00:45.598
Follow my lead.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.767
Oh! What are we tasting now?

00:47.769 --> 00:49.035
Coconut.

00:49.037 --> 00:51.237
- What's your fiance's name?
- Doug Franklin.

00:51.239 --> 00:52.705
- Where'd you meet?
- He's a fireman.

00:52.707 --> 00:54.490
- He rescued my cat.
- Aw.

00:54.492 --> 00:57.825
No "aw."
That's an insurance commercial.

00:57.912 --> 01:00.363
- So where's the wedding?
- Barefoot on the beach.

01:00.365 --> 01:02.615
That's a tampon commercial.

01:02.617 --> 01:04.167
Ooh! Hi, baby!

01:06.204 --> 01:08.588
Max, you're wrong.
They're kissing.

01:08.590 --> 01:11.090
Nope, he's either
an out-of-work actor she hired,

01:11.092 --> 01:14.010
or he has cake in his mouth.

01:29.974 --> 01:31.274
I have an announcement to make.

01:31.275 --> 01:34.111
You found your first "down there" hair?

01:34.362 --> 01:36.863
No, it's the last chance
to put in your business card

01:36.864 --> 01:38.698
to win a luxury weekend vacation.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.266
It's Han's big promo.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.135
Well, he's finally announced it.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.471
Han's a big promo.

01:44.472 --> 01:47.407
Well, he's a little promo.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.576
Good luck, you now have a chance

01:49.577 --> 01:51.945
to win a fancy two-room suite
in the country,

01:51.946 --> 01:55.279
and there's a fireplace
because Daddy don't skimp.

01:55.416 --> 01:58.651
Aw, I miss our fireplace
in the country.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.186
My father and I would sit together,

02:00.187 --> 02:02.622
and I'd roast marshmallows,
and then he'd burn

02:02.623 --> 02:05.956
what I now realize must've been
incriminating documents.

02:06.526 --> 02:09.359
Hi, everybody!
The raffle girl is here.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.465
Oh, I get to pull the winner!

02:12.466 --> 02:13.933
She pulled me twice today,

02:13.934 --> 02:16.202
and I won both times.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.438
Sophie, the way you look tonight,

02:18.439 --> 02:20.140
we are all winners.

02:20.141 --> 02:23.376
Oh, Earl, that is so sweet.

02:23.377 --> 02:26.710
I would kiss you if it was legal.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.751
All right, I'm going to put in one

02:31.752 --> 02:34.154
of my cleaning company cards.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.488
All right.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.956
Who's gonna be the winner?

02:36.957 --> 02:40.290
Yeah, yeah, shake it
like a Polaroid picture, baby.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.629
Yeah.
Oh.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.098
Oh, no, that doesn't feel like my card.

02:45.099 --> 02:47.100
Sophie, that's cheating.

02:47.101 --> 02:50.434
Hey, keep out of it,
Glinda the good bitch.

02:51.405 --> 02:54.238
And the winner is...

02:54.708 --> 02:57.043
Max's Homemade Cupcakes?

02:57.044 --> 02:59.612
Oh, my God!
We won!

02:59.613 --> 03:01.147
Congratulations!

03:01.148 --> 03:03.416
I've never won anything in my life!

03:03.417 --> 03:04.751
Except for that time I got stoned

03:04.752 --> 03:07.587
and accidentally won
that hot dog eating contest.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.289
Wait, how did this even happen?

03:09.290 --> 03:10.356
Did you put our card in?

03:10.357 --> 03:12.192
Actually, I put your card in,

03:12.193 --> 03:13.726
and I took a few out.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.962
I figured you girls
could use a vacation.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.163
You girls been working harder

03:17.164 --> 03:20.099
than my liver on payday.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.835
Oh, Earl, you're like Santa

03:21.836 --> 03:25.169
without the weird fixation on children.

03:25.272 --> 03:27.474
It was so nice of Earl to enter us.

03:27.475 --> 03:30.808
Oh, stop.
He's like my father.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.613
Wow, this place actually looks nice.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.782
Ooh, an outhouse!

03:35.783 --> 03:37.851
- Max, that's a sauna.
- Oh.

03:37.852 --> 03:40.220
Either way, I'm peeing in it.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.121
But Max, can we leave the shop?

03:42.122 --> 03:43.690
I mean, even though business
has been slow,

03:43.691 --> 03:44.757
what if Dottie wants to come back

03:44.758 --> 03:46.125
and order cupcakes for her wedding?

03:46.126 --> 03:48.528
First off, she ate them all.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.096
Second, there is no wedding.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.664
She's a B.S. Bride.

03:51.665 --> 03:52.899
I guarantee you, right now,

03:52.900 --> 03:54.667
she's crawling
through an air-conditioning vent

03:54.668 --> 03:56.736
at a Krispy Kreme.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.339
Andy in the house!

03:59.340 --> 04:01.407
Sorry, I was watching
a <i>Living Single</i> marathon

04:01.408 --> 04:03.710
before I came over.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.378
You are not gonna believe this.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.946
We won a weekend getaway.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.249
Isn't that exciting?
We really needed this.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.817
That's great!

04:10.818 --> 04:12.318
We do need this.
Thanks, babe.

04:12.319 --> 04:14.053
And I was hoping to get
a little special one-on-one time

04:14.054 --> 04:15.121
with you this weekend.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.221
So when do we leave?

04:16.223 --> 04:17.390
Oh, we!

04:17.391 --> 04:18.825
We can leave tomorrow.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.594
We--we--we
all the way there.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.696
Look, Han said it
was a two-room suite.

04:23.697 --> 04:24.731
Andy can come with us.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.032
It's still our trip.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.600
He doesn't have to know
he's the third wheel.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.903
Well, you know
I'm always a fan of lying,

04:29.904 --> 04:31.671
so I'm in.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.139
It's still our trip.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.808
She doesn't have to know
she's the third wheel.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.343
Well, you know I'm not a fan of lying,

04:37.344 --> 04:40.179
but okay, I'm in.

04:47.088 --> 04:48.289
I love a road trip.

04:48.290 --> 04:49.790
My mom and I took one in third grade

04:49.791 --> 04:52.259
for, like, a year, but we'd
just drive around locally and--

04:52.260 --> 04:55.563
Oh, my God, I lived in a car.

04:55.564 --> 04:57.665
Hey, let's play a card game.

04:57.666 --> 05:00.434
I spy something red.

05:00.935 --> 05:02.369
Is it that gas station?

05:02.620 --> 05:03.654
Nope.

05:03.655 --> 05:05.189
- Is it that truck?
- Nope.

05:05.190 --> 05:07.457
Is it boring? Yes!
My turn.

05:07.458 --> 05:10.027
I spy something annoying.

05:10.028 --> 05:11.328
- Is it me?
- Yes!

05:11.329 --> 05:12.462
I knew the joke was on me,

05:12.463 --> 05:14.298
but I love to win.

05:14.299 --> 05:16.333
You are not annoying.
You're adorable.

05:16.334 --> 05:18.569
I spy a big man-gina.

05:18.570 --> 05:20.003
- Is it me?
- Yes!

05:20.004 --> 05:21.872
I like to win too.

05:24.042 --> 05:26.176
Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

05:26.177 --> 05:27.644
Hello?

05:27.645 --> 05:29.079
Bad cell area.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.548
Max, I think that might've been
Dottie, the B.S. Bride.

05:31.549 --> 05:32.583
I couldn't hear the words,

05:32.584 --> 05:35.085
but she sounded unnaturally confident.

05:35.086 --> 05:37.821
Maybe the B.S.
stands for "big sale."

05:37.822 --> 05:39.456
No more business calls, okay?

05:39.457 --> 05:40.824
I thought we were getting away for fun.

05:40.825 --> 05:42.359
We are, but our business

05:42.360 --> 05:43.894
is nowhere near where we need it to be,

05:43.895 --> 05:45.262
and when it comes to ignoring a call,

05:45.263 --> 05:46.763
it's kind of hard.

05:46.764 --> 05:49.566
Hey, you know what this area
of the mountains is known for?

05:49.567 --> 05:52.135
Wineries and incest?

05:52.136 --> 05:54.037
Alien abductions!

05:54.038 --> 05:55.239
I know all about it.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.074
People disappear from here
all the time.

05:57.075 --> 05:59.543
Max, there's no such thing
as an extraterrestrial.

05:59.544 --> 06:02.877
Okay, first, that's something
an extraterrestrial would say.

06:04.048 --> 06:06.283
I've always wanted to be abducted.

06:06.284 --> 06:09.617
And my guidance counselor
said I had no goals.

06:11.723 --> 06:12.823
And here we go.

06:12.824 --> 06:14.224
Again, I don't believe in names,

06:14.225 --> 06:16.493
but feel free to call me
"Roger" if it helps you.

06:16.494 --> 06:18.629
Get out!
<i>Get out!</i>

06:18.630 --> 06:20.898
The bed floats!
This is awesome!

06:20.899 --> 06:23.400
Usually, you gotta
bring the ropes to the bed.

06:23.401 --> 06:26.303
This way, you get
to eliminate a whole step!

06:26.304 --> 06:27.704
The bed's sculptural beauty

06:27.705 --> 06:30.407
is actually surpassed
by the joy of resting in it.

06:30.408 --> 06:32.175
Some say it's like
being rocked to sleep

06:32.176 --> 06:33.977
in the arms of God.

06:33.978 --> 06:36.613
It's a sex bed, Roger.

06:36.614 --> 06:38.248
May I light the fire for you?

06:38.249 --> 06:39.650
Oh, no, thanks.
I can do it.

06:39.651 --> 06:40.851
I was an Eagle Scout.

06:40.852 --> 06:42.152
Man, there's just not enough occasions

06:42.153 --> 06:44.721
where I can brag about that.

06:44.722 --> 06:46.957
The room is cute, but really tiny.

06:46.958 --> 06:48.225
We're gonna need a bigger space,

06:48.226 --> 06:51.559
unless we're Hobbits.

06:51.696 --> 06:53.297
Is this the door to the adjoining room?

06:53.298 --> 06:54.698
Well, that is an adjoining room,

06:54.699 --> 06:56.533
but it's not included in your package.

06:56.534 --> 06:57.668
Oh, damn it!

06:57.669 --> 06:59.102
We should've known Han's package

06:59.103 --> 07:02.436
was gonna be smaller
than he said it is.

07:06.344 --> 07:08.078
I'm sorry.
All the other cabins are booked.

07:08.079 --> 07:10.247
I'll bring you some bedding
for the couch

07:10.248 --> 07:13.016
at an additional price.

07:13.017 --> 07:15.719
<i>Ohm Shanti.</i>

07:15.720 --> 07:18.188
Well, I guess you guys

07:18.189 --> 07:20.490
are the couple,
so I'll sleep on the couch.

07:20.491 --> 07:21.658
I can sleep anywhere.

07:21.659 --> 07:22.826
First two years of my life,

07:22.827 --> 07:26.160
my bed was a pile of unopened mail.

07:26.197 --> 07:27.631
A big, roaring fire

07:27.632 --> 07:29.633
is gonna be so romantic.

07:29.634 --> 07:31.068
Come over here closer to me,

07:31.069 --> 07:32.502
you big Eagle Scout.

07:32.503 --> 07:35.836
Well, now you sound
like my Scoutmaster.

07:38.242 --> 07:40.344
Hey, don't start anything
you can't finish in a minute.

07:40.345 --> 07:41.745
Max'll be right out.

07:41.746 --> 07:44.348
Something tells me she's
not a consistent hand-washer.

07:44.349 --> 07:45.615
You do your thing.

07:45.616 --> 07:46.817
I'm just gonna sit right here,

07:46.818 --> 07:48.986
and watch my man build a fire.

07:48.987 --> 07:50.654
Oh, great, this is cedar!

07:50.655 --> 07:51.888
It's gonna smell so awesome.

07:51.889 --> 07:54.391
I love falling asleep
to the sound of a fire.

07:54.392 --> 07:55.759
Oh, my God.

07:55.760 --> 07:56.893
I know, no business stuff,

07:56.894 --> 07:58.862
but I just got a text
about a big order.

07:58.863 --> 08:00.597
That's fine,
just remember this weekend--

08:00.598 --> 08:02.666
Oh, I know, me and you.

08:02.667 --> 08:05.669
Me and you,
me and you--

08:05.670 --> 08:07.504
Max! Max.

08:07.505 --> 08:09.506
Turns out the B.S. Bride
isn't B.S.

08:09.507 --> 08:11.375
She wants pricing
on a wedding cupcake cake,

08:11.376 --> 08:13.744
and a groom's cupcake cake,
for 300 guests.

08:13.745 --> 08:14.978
Great!

08:14.979 --> 08:18.312
Almost as great
as these little fuzzy shoes!

08:18.349 --> 08:20.350
They were in a sealed plastic package.

08:20.351 --> 08:22.386
I'm the first one to ever open them.

08:22.387 --> 08:25.720
They're like condoms for your feet!

08:26.591 --> 08:28.458
♪ New shoes, new shoes ♪

08:28.459 --> 08:29.526
Where are you going?

08:29.527 --> 08:30.727
To the sauna.

08:30.728 --> 08:32.294
Hopefully, I'll be abducted on my way,

08:32.296 --> 08:33.563
but know that even though I'm gone,

08:33.563 --> 08:36.600
I'm happier up there
with my alien lover.

08:36.601 --> 08:38.034
True, they don't have lips,

08:38.035 --> 08:40.971
but they
do have crazy-long fingers.

08:40.972 --> 08:42.339
I'll go with you.

08:42.340 --> 08:43.607
Not to talk about work,

08:43.607 --> 08:45.776
but she can't go alone.
There might be bears.

08:45.777 --> 08:47.811
There were always bears
at my chalet in Aspen,

08:47.812 --> 08:50.313
in the woods,
lying on the floors, everywhere.

08:50.314 --> 08:53.647
You know, until PETA
attacked the house.

08:54.085 --> 08:56.453
So this is a fancy sauna?

08:56.454 --> 08:57.554
Not impressed.

08:57.555 --> 08:59.189
People pay for the privilege

08:59.190 --> 09:02.192
of sitting in decades of ass sweat?

09:02.193 --> 09:03.794
How come your towel's staying up

09:03.795 --> 09:05.962
so much better than mine?

09:05.963 --> 09:08.732
I can think of two reasons.

09:08.733 --> 09:10.734
I'm gonna get some water,
and then start peeing.

09:10.735 --> 09:12.035
When you come back, we have to discuss

09:12.036 --> 09:13.270
the B.S. Bride's cake.

09:13.271 --> 09:15.439
We can't screw this up.
It's all we have.

09:16.441 --> 09:18.141
This heat is amazing.

09:18.142 --> 09:20.777
Mother of God!
That's hot.

09:20.778 --> 09:22.479
There are bears out there.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.980
- They're coming this way.
- What?

09:23.981 --> 09:26.083
Max, get in here!
Close the door!

09:26.084 --> 09:28.652
Fine, but they'll just open it
and come in.

09:28.653 --> 09:31.321
Bears can't open doors and walk in.

09:31.322 --> 09:34.655
These ones can.

09:34.826 --> 09:37.594
Hey, girls.
You mind if we join you?

09:37.595 --> 09:38.895
You guys are gay bears, right?

09:38.896 --> 09:40.697
- Max!
- It's cool.

09:40.698 --> 09:42.466
My prom date is big
in the bear scene now,

09:42.467 --> 09:43.867
but in high school,
they just called him a jock

09:43.868 --> 09:44.901
who cried sometimes.

09:46.270 --> 09:49.139
Yep, we're bears.
Big, hairy,<i> not </i> scary.

09:50.641 --> 09:52.075
I'm Deke.
This is Dirk.

09:52.076 --> 09:53.844
Yup, we're Deke and Dirk.

09:53.845 --> 09:56.046
Pause for reaction.

09:56.047 --> 09:57.614
I'm Caroline, and this is Max.

09:57.615 --> 09:59.683
Are you girls lipstick lesbians?

09:59.684 --> 10:01.685
No, we're just friends,

10:01.686 --> 10:03.153
and we can't afford lipstick.

10:03.154 --> 10:04.788
Especially at this gift shop.

10:04.789 --> 10:05.789
Have you seen the prices?

10:05.790 --> 10:07.357
$25 for chap stick?

10:07.358 --> 10:09.126
Please.
No one's lips are that chapped.

10:10.394 --> 10:11.561
And he would know.

10:11.562 --> 10:13.630
This one's the king of face creaming.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.867
A little bit dirtier than what it is.

10:16.868 --> 10:19.169
I'm actually a dermatologist.

10:19.170 --> 10:20.170
Oh, my God.

10:20.171 --> 10:21.304
Do not tell me I'm lucky enough

10:21.305 --> 10:23.173
to be in a sauna
with two dermatologists.

10:23.174 --> 10:24.274
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.408
I'm an astrophysicist.

10:25.409 --> 10:27.677
Oh, smarter than the average bear.

10:29.113 --> 10:30.447
- Loving her.
- Mm-hmm.

10:30.448 --> 10:33.016
So you know about
space stuff, smarty bear.

10:33.017 --> 10:34.351
Do you believe in aliens?

10:34.352 --> 10:37.187
Oh, I do, and I believe
they're living among us.

10:37.188 --> 10:40.390
I'm looking at you, Christina Ricci!

10:40.391 --> 10:42.125
So talk to me, Deke.
What can you give me?

10:42.126 --> 10:45.028
He has <i>plenty</i> of free cream samples
back in our room.

10:45.029 --> 10:46.663
And it's the good stuff.
You should come by!

10:46.664 --> 10:47.731
We're in cabin four.

10:47.732 --> 10:49.166
No way!
We're in cabin three.

10:49.167 --> 10:52.002
Ah!

10:52.003 --> 10:53.570
How about those rope beds?

10:53.571 --> 10:55.805
You know it's kinky
when the bed is already tied up.

10:57.108 --> 10:59.976
First, we were all
"um, we're gonna fall,"

10:59.977 --> 11:01.011
but then we thought, "what the hell?

11:01.012 --> 11:02.312
It's our man-iversary."

11:02.313 --> 11:03.513
Aw, you're married?

11:03.514 --> 11:05.182
Happy anniversary.

11:05.183 --> 11:07.217
Now, let's get back
to those free creams.

11:07.218 --> 11:08.418
Oh, and here's our card

11:08.419 --> 11:09.419
if you're ever in the neighborhood

11:09.420 --> 11:10.854
or need a big order.

11:10.855 --> 11:13.089
You brought a business card to a sauna?

11:13.090 --> 11:15.158
I don't wanna know where you kept that.

11:15.159 --> 11:16.826
- Max's Homemade Cupcakes.
- Mm.

11:16.827 --> 11:18.662
Or in your case,
cub-cakes.

11:20.464 --> 11:21.998
- Loving her.
- Living for her.

11:21.999 --> 11:23.099
Wanna come back as her.

11:31.879 --> 11:33.146
There you go, your dinner for two.

11:33.147 --> 11:35.214
Two soups, two salads,
two entrees, two desserts.

11:35.265 --> 11:38.434
I hope you three enjoy.

11:38.435 --> 11:40.269
Maybe could we order another meal?

11:40.270 --> 11:41.771
No problem, just call.

11:41.772 --> 11:43.506
Extra charge, of course.

11:43.507 --> 11:45.008
<i>Ohm Shanti.</i>

11:45.309 --> 11:48.044
<i>Ohm Shanti</i> means "screw you"
in yoga, right?

11:48.045 --> 11:50.246
I am so starving.

11:50.247 --> 11:52.148
Oh, my God, this looks amazing!

11:52.149 --> 11:54.083
Oh, and the bread is still warm!

11:54.084 --> 11:56.919
And there's one of those
crazy-ass pretzel rolls.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.488
Is it a pretzel?
Is it a roll?

11:58.489 --> 11:59.822
No idea, it's crazy.

12:00.958 --> 12:02.358
Max, put some of this butter on it.

12:02.359 --> 12:04.694
Try and stop me, bitch!

12:04.695 --> 12:06.663
Here, take half.
Thanks!

12:06.664 --> 12:08.164
Mm.

12:08.165 --> 12:09.432
Yo.

12:09.433 --> 12:11.934
Oh, my God, Andy!
I totally forgot.

12:11.935 --> 12:14.303
Not about you.
I forgot my manners.

12:14.304 --> 12:15.705
If my Danish governess were here,

12:15.706 --> 12:18.107
she would hit me with her wooden spoon.

12:18.108 --> 12:19.208
I'm so sorry.

12:19.209 --> 12:20.777
Go, sit.
You eat.

12:20.778 --> 12:22.045
Enjoy the pretzel roll.

12:22.046 --> 12:24.747
It's gone.
You snooze, you lose.

12:24.748 --> 12:25.748
No, you sit.
I'm good.

12:25.749 --> 12:26.849
I'll order more food.

12:26.850 --> 12:28.084
No, sit!
Sit.

12:28.085 --> 12:30.687
I'm the bad one.

12:30.688 --> 12:32.955
This soup is "duh-mazing."

12:32.956 --> 12:34.390
Just a word I made up

12:34.391 --> 12:36.025
for when something's
so amazing, you're stunned,

12:36.026 --> 12:37.727
and all you can say
is "duh."

12:37.728 --> 12:39.462
Duh-mazing.

12:39.463 --> 12:41.731
Yes, I'd like
to order anoth--

12:41.732 --> 12:44.100
Yes, I'll hold.

12:44.101 --> 12:47.434
I think the hold music
is just Roger singing.

12:47.638 --> 12:48.905
Okay, hang up the phone.

12:48.906 --> 12:50.373
Go sit and eat.
Come on.

12:50.374 --> 12:51.941
Hurry before Max eats the table.

12:51.942 --> 12:53.910
No, you eat.

12:53.911 --> 12:55.712
After all, it's our special weekend.

12:55.713 --> 12:57.080
I want you to enjoy it.

12:57.081 --> 12:58.214
Well, okay,

12:58.215 --> 13:00.016
but only because
it's a special occasion.

13:00.017 --> 13:01.084
Good!

13:01.085 --> 13:02.285
I'm gonna go take a hot shower.

13:02.286 --> 13:03.586
Besides, it's always better
to make love

13:03.587 --> 13:04.854
on an empty stomach.

13:04.855 --> 13:08.188
That must be why there
are so many people in India.

13:08.792 --> 13:10.793
Max, I got a favor to ask you.

13:10.794 --> 13:12.628
Do you think you can go visit
your bear friends next door,

13:12.629 --> 13:14.363
maybe give us some private time?

13:14.364 --> 13:17.233
It'll be your birthday gift to me.

13:17.234 --> 13:18.735
Oh!

13:18.736 --> 13:21.304
It would be my birthday gift to you

13:21.305 --> 13:22.739
because it's your birthday.

13:22.740 --> 13:24.874
Yeah, just for, like, two hours.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.142
Okay, one hour.

13:26.143 --> 13:27.410
I'll skip the foreplay,

13:27.411 --> 13:28.978
and that'll be
my birthday gift to myself.

13:30.547 --> 13:33.516
Cool, then I'll just go do that, then.

13:33.517 --> 13:35.351
I mean, Caroline
went to all this trouble

13:35.352 --> 13:37.386
to get you a trip
for your birthday, I assume.

13:37.387 --> 13:38.654
I know,

13:38.655 --> 13:40.690
and I was really looking forward
to some birthday sex

13:40.691 --> 13:42.458
since we haven't really
connected that way

13:42.459 --> 13:44.694
since the shop started
giving you guys so much trouble.

13:44.695 --> 13:46.863
But the shop's been
in trouble for weeks.

13:46.864 --> 13:50.197
Yeah, so maybe I'll only need,
like, a half hour with her.

13:50.734 --> 13:52.869
I need my book.
I'm gonna take a bath instead.

13:52.870 --> 13:54.637
That tub is <i>so</i> amazing.

13:54.638 --> 13:55.772
I'm just gonna soak in it

13:55.773 --> 13:57.774
and blissfully forget all my problems.

13:57.775 --> 13:59.809
As well as some other things.

13:59.810 --> 14:01.811
Max is gonna go visit
Yogi and Boo Boo next door

14:01.812 --> 14:03.279
and give us some private time.

14:03.280 --> 14:04.280
She can't do that.

14:04.281 --> 14:05.581
It's their man-iversary.

14:05.582 --> 14:07.049
They need their private time.

14:07.050 --> 14:08.985
Yes, but you guys

14:08.986 --> 14:11.888
are celebrating a special thing, too.

14:11.889 --> 14:13.790
What?
What are we celebrating?

14:13.791 --> 14:15.825
Andy's birthday.
Oh, damn it!

14:15.826 --> 14:18.594
Now, I went and spoiled
all the special sexual things

14:18.595 --> 14:21.430
you had planned for him.

14:21.431 --> 14:23.032
Damn it, Max!

14:23.033 --> 14:25.134
Now, you <i>did</i> give it all away.

14:25.135 --> 14:27.470
We were gonna do missionary,

14:27.471 --> 14:29.004
and...

14:30.071 --> 14:31.504
...the other one.

14:35.110 --> 14:36.412
Okay.

14:36.413 --> 14:38.047
Okay, I'm sorry.
I forgot.

14:38.048 --> 14:40.750
I don't know how.
I <i>knew</i> today was your birthday.

14:40.751 --> 14:43.152
It's tomorrow.

14:43.153 --> 14:44.654
So yippee!

14:44.655 --> 14:45.888
She hasn't missed it.

14:45.889 --> 14:47.223
All's right with the world.

14:48.325 --> 14:51.227
I'm gonna go visit the berenstains.

14:51.228 --> 14:53.629
This weekend wasn't
about my birthday, was it?

14:53.630 --> 14:55.765
Come on, come on.

14:55.766 --> 14:57.233
Get your hand out of his honeypot

14:57.234 --> 15:00.102
and get over here.

15:00.103 --> 15:01.404
I'll be gone in a second,

15:01.405 --> 15:04.307
and then you guys can
jump-start your sex life again.

15:04.308 --> 15:06.676
What do you mean
"jump-start"?

15:06.677 --> 15:08.044
How could you tell Max

15:08.045 --> 15:09.245
that we haven't had sex?

15:09.246 --> 15:11.047
You haven't even
discussed that with me.

15:11.048 --> 15:12.215
Come on, aliens.

15:12.216 --> 15:13.950
If you're ever going to abduct me,

15:13.951 --> 15:15.852
this would be the time.

15:15.853 --> 15:17.386
Don't take the attention off the fact

15:17.387 --> 15:20.389
that you forgot my birthday.

15:20.390 --> 15:22.191
Oh, God, I wish I was a cartoon,

15:22.192 --> 15:23.526
so I could run right through this door,

15:23.527 --> 15:26.860
and leave behind
a body-shaped hole.

15:27.030 --> 15:28.130
- Oh, hey, Max.
- Hey.

15:28.131 --> 15:29.131
Mind if I hibernate for a minute?

15:29.132 --> 15:30.433
Oh, sure, come on in.

15:30.434 --> 15:32.335
We were just gonna eat
and then dye our chest hair.

15:34.338 --> 15:36.806
Close that damn door now.

15:36.807 --> 15:38.574
Thanks, it was just getting
a little tense in there.

15:38.575 --> 15:41.010
- She forgot his birthday.
- Mm, ouch.

15:41.011 --> 15:42.311
Well, he forgot mine once,

15:42.312 --> 15:44.981
and now it's his ankle tattoo.

15:44.982 --> 15:46.682
Max, please, I insist.

15:46.683 --> 15:47.850
You don't have to ask me twice.

15:47.851 --> 15:49.986
You gonna eat the pretzel roll?

15:50.487 --> 15:52.221
Andy, I'm sorry about your birthday.

15:52.222 --> 15:53.589
It just went out of my head.

15:53.590 --> 15:54.757
I feel bad.

15:54.758 --> 15:55.758
And I feel sick.

15:55.759 --> 15:57.426
Can you stop swinging the bed?

15:57.427 --> 15:59.428
Sorry, I'm nervous.

15:59.429 --> 16:00.963
Yeah, you're nervous a lot,

16:00.964 --> 16:03.266
which is why our other bed
isn't moving at all.

16:03.267 --> 16:04.333
No, no, no, no, no, don't go.

16:04.334 --> 16:06.535
Come back.
Come back to the sex bed.

16:06.536 --> 16:07.803
Let's get some sex going!

16:07.804 --> 16:10.439
Come on! We can
get this bed moving now!

16:10.440 --> 16:11.440
See!

16:11.441 --> 16:13.209
See?

16:13.210 --> 16:16.045
Hey! Oh, hi!

16:16.046 --> 16:18.881
Oh, it's your birthday!
It's your birthday!

16:18.882 --> 16:20.449
It's tomorrow.

16:20.450 --> 16:22.051
Okay.
Okay.

16:22.052 --> 16:23.552
I can do better, see?

16:23.553 --> 16:25.021
Here we go!

16:25.022 --> 16:26.822
Now, here we go!

16:26.823 --> 16:30.156
Wanna see me twerk it?
Oh!

16:31.862 --> 16:35.164
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

16:35.165 --> 16:37.066
If I'd had any food, I would throw up.

16:37.067 --> 16:38.534
Okay, yeah, have a seat.

16:38.535 --> 16:40.236
Let's have some bread.

16:42.072 --> 16:44.674
Has it really been that long
since we had sex?

16:44.675 --> 16:46.008
Sweetie, after that dance,

16:46.009 --> 16:49.342
it's hard to believe
you've ever had sex.

16:50.647 --> 16:51.781
It hasn't been <i>that</i> long.

16:51.782 --> 16:52.982
The shop opened on the 12th,

16:52.983 --> 16:55.251
so it's...

16:55.252 --> 16:57.019
What?

16:57.020 --> 16:58.287
No, it's just interesting

16:58.288 --> 17:00.489
you had no problem
remembering that date.

17:00.490 --> 17:02.458
Let me ask you a question.

17:02.459 --> 17:04.060
Where do you think you're going?

17:04.060 --> 17:05.294
What do you mean?
I'm here.

17:05.295 --> 17:06.529
No.

17:06.530 --> 17:07.762
Where do you think you're going?

17:07.763 --> 17:09.999
Like, where do you see
your life in a year?

17:10.000 --> 17:11.733
Well, pretty soon, Max and I

17:11.734 --> 17:12.969
will be out of this rough patch,

17:12.970 --> 17:14.136
and full force with the business,

17:14.137 --> 17:15.671
doing weddings and big events,

17:15.672 --> 17:18.007
and then Max and I will
probably open another store,

17:18.008 --> 17:19.075
get a bigger apartment.

17:19.076 --> 17:22.011
Okay, and am I in there somewhere?

17:22.012 --> 17:24.446
Oh, come on.
I was getting to you.

17:24.448 --> 17:25.647
Were you?

17:25.648 --> 17:28.217
When? When were you
getting to me?

17:28.218 --> 17:30.886
After your business is a success?

17:30.887 --> 17:32.088
No! Now.

17:32.089 --> 17:35.091
Come on.
Sex time in the sex bed.

17:38.929 --> 17:42.262
Wanna do it on the floor?

17:43.199 --> 17:46.032
This is so comfortable!

17:47.537 --> 17:49.238
You put a belt on this,
you could wear it out.

17:50.574 --> 17:52.174
Just don't try that
at your in-laws' house

17:52.175 --> 17:54.176
with a matching turban.

17:54.177 --> 17:56.879
Dirk, my father
worked 40 years in the factory

17:56.880 --> 17:58.247
before he lost his arm.

17:58.248 --> 18:00.416
- He doesn't get "camp."
- Okay.

18:00.417 --> 18:01.417
Now get up here, lady.

18:01.418 --> 18:02.585
We're having cookies and milk.

18:02.586 --> 18:04.387
You guys rock.

18:04.388 --> 18:06.655
I promise I won't stay here all night.

18:06.656 --> 18:07.890
Don't wanna get trapped in the middle

18:07.891 --> 18:09.725
of your country bear jamboree.

18:11.461 --> 18:12.528
Please, honey.

18:12.529 --> 18:14.330
You are perfectly safe in this bed.

18:14.331 --> 18:17.066
We haven't had sex in a year.

18:17.067 --> 18:18.834
Why would you tell her that?

18:18.835 --> 18:20.536
Well, she told us about
her friends not having sex.

18:20.537 --> 18:21.971
I thought it was on the table.

18:21.972 --> 18:24.006
But <i>we</i> haven't even discussed that.

18:24.007 --> 18:27.340
Mother ship, make it happen!

18:28.478 --> 18:31.811
This is the time to abduct me.

18:33.216 --> 18:35.484
Hi. Max, you can come back.
Andy left.

18:35.485 --> 18:37.086
He said he'd find his own way home.

18:37.087 --> 18:40.420
- He left?
- Because you're not having sex?

18:40.757 --> 18:43.325
Max, you told the bears
we're not having sex?

18:43.326 --> 18:44.493
Why would you share that?

18:44.494 --> 18:45.795
Exactly, Caroline.

18:45.796 --> 18:47.530
And why would you tell Max that,

18:47.531 --> 18:49.765
when you never even brought
it up in our Gestalt therapy?

18:49.766 --> 18:52.535
I was planning on addressing
it with you this weekend.

18:52.536 --> 18:54.637
You think I'd spend $500 on this room

18:54.638 --> 18:55.938
for milk and cookies?

18:55.939 --> 18:57.740
I think we're all forgetting

18:57.741 --> 18:59.809
how good that soup was.

18:59.810 --> 19:01.077
Well, I'm sorry
if I haven't been feeling

19:01.078 --> 19:02.278
very attractive lately.

19:02.279 --> 19:04.780
I tell you how handsome
you are every day.

19:04.781 --> 19:08.114
Don't you guys look exactly alike?

19:09.519 --> 19:10.653
Are you okay?

19:10.654 --> 19:11.987
I'm all right.

19:11.988 --> 19:14.156
You wanna get in bed
and cuddle for a little while?

19:14.157 --> 19:15.758
No, it's--
yeah.

19:15.759 --> 19:17.326
Come on.
Yeah, get in here.

19:17.327 --> 19:19.595
There you go.
There you go.

19:19.596 --> 19:21.664
Whoo!

19:22.966 --> 19:24.700
Oh, good.
You're alive.

19:24.701 --> 19:26.335
When I heard you left
and walked through the woods,

19:26.336 --> 19:29.669
I wondered,
"was there anal probing?"

19:30.240 --> 19:33.209
By an alien, not a grifter.

19:33.210 --> 19:34.543
You texted you wanted to see me?

19:34.544 --> 19:37.313
Well, someone did.

19:37.314 --> 19:38.848
Happy Birthday!

19:38.849 --> 19:40.015
Now, come on, blow.

19:40.016 --> 19:41.617
I don't really feel like doing that.

19:41.618 --> 19:44.820
Welcome to our world.

19:47.023 --> 19:49.058
Andy, I'm so sorry about everything.

19:49.559 --> 19:50.192
It's okay.

19:50.193 --> 19:51.961
I had a lot of time
to think on the bus,

19:51.962 --> 19:53.796
and the other bus,
and the bus I had to take

19:53.797 --> 19:55.431
when that bus broke down.

19:55.432 --> 19:56.665
If it makes you feel any better,

19:56.666 --> 19:59.835
I have rope burns all down my back.

19:59.836 --> 20:02.505
Andy, I'm sorry about your birthday.

20:02.506 --> 20:04.006
We told each other
those dates a month ago.

20:04.007 --> 20:05.975
I wouldn't expect you to remember mine.

20:05.976 --> 20:07.776
May 28th, 1987.

20:07.777 --> 20:09.478
10:30 in the morning.

20:09.479 --> 20:12.812
10:30 at night,
so you're not perfect.

20:13.450 --> 20:15.451
Look, you have a really busy life,

20:15.452 --> 20:18.020
and you're really ambitious,
which I admire,

20:18.021 --> 20:20.589
but I wanna be more than someone
you get to eventually.

20:20.590 --> 20:21.957
And you deserve that.

20:21.958 --> 20:24.126
It's just I have to put
the business first right now--

20:24.127 --> 20:25.294
And I get that.

20:25.295 --> 20:28.628
I just--I think we
should take a break.

20:28.732 --> 20:30.299
You wanna take a break?

20:30.300 --> 20:33.369
Maybe, yeah.

20:33.370 --> 20:34.570
Are you saying take a break

20:34.571 --> 20:35.638
'cause you really mean "break up,"

20:35.639 --> 20:37.206
but you're trying to be nice?

20:37.207 --> 20:39.808
Maybe, yeah.

20:39.809 --> 20:40.943
I'm sorry if this seems sudden,

20:40.944 --> 20:42.278
but I know me,

20:42.279 --> 20:44.713
and maybe it's better sooner
than later.

20:44.714 --> 20:46.482
I'm back!

20:46.483 --> 20:48.050
And I brought my bridesmaids!

20:50.086 --> 20:52.688
Looks like business is picking up.

20:52.689 --> 20:54.657
It's gonna be hard not to see you.

20:54.658 --> 20:56.525
Yeah, it will be.

20:56.526 --> 20:58.961
I work 10 feet away.

20:58.962 --> 21:00.129
This way, ladies.

21:00.130 --> 21:02.831
We're gonna taste
every cupcake they have!

21:02.832 --> 21:05.534
This is the time to take me!

21:05.535 --> 21:06.835
Come on, final offer!

21:06.836 --> 21:08.871
E.T.? Alf?

21:08.872 --> 21:11.006
Christina Ricci?

21:15.479 --> 21:19.847
