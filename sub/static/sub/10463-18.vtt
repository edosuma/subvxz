WEBVTT

00:03.268 --> 00:04.287
The way I see it,

00:04.311 --> 00:07.123
your 12th birthday is technically
your last one as a kid,

00:07.147 --> 00:08.750
because, uh, 13's next,

00:08.774 --> 00:12.253
and once you're a teenager,
you're practically a grownup.

00:12.277 --> 00:13.995
Claudia, I'm studying, okay?

00:15.030 --> 00:19.135
So, I figure the 12th birthday
should be a real blow-out.

00:19.159 --> 00:20.794
Right?

00:22.663 --> 00:23.598
Right?

00:23.622 --> 00:26.434
Right. Whatever. Go away.

00:26.458 --> 00:29.719
Too bad about Kirsten's conference.
She'll miss all the fun,

00:29.836 --> 00:32.472
but I bet she brings us
something cool from Chicago.

00:32.965 --> 00:34.933
- What do they make in Chicago?
- Claudia!

00:35.258 --> 00:38.029
Bay, what'd you do for
your 12th birthday?

00:38.053 --> 00:39.396
Who took my wallet?

00:39.513 --> 00:42.774
Something great, right?
Like a 49ers game?

00:42.891 --> 00:44.077
I'm working here.

00:44.101 --> 00:46.287
- I'm not done talking to you.
- Well, I'm done talking to you.

00:46.311 --> 00:47.664
Does that mean
you'll all shut up?

00:47.688 --> 00:49.207
I am not letting you
run off to L.A.

00:49.231 --> 00:51.157
What are you going to do?
Steal my fan belt?

00:51.233 --> 00:52.293
You're going to L.A.?

00:52.317 --> 00:53.336
- Why?
- Because he's an idiot.

00:53.360 --> 00:54.295
Would you lay off?

00:54.319 --> 00:55.880
Well, what's in L.A.?

00:55.904 --> 00:58.456
- Nothing, okay?
- Jill.

00:58.865 --> 01:00.083
Uh-oh.

01:00.575 --> 01:03.429
L.A. is a big city, Bay. How
do you expect to find her?

01:03.453 --> 01:04.721
One of her friends
gave me a name.

01:04.745 --> 01:07.725
A waitress from the coffee house
moved down there last year.

01:07.749 --> 01:08.810
She's probably staying with her.

01:08.834 --> 01:09.852
Well, when are you coming back?

01:09.876 --> 01:11.386
He is not going!

01:11.420 --> 01:13.179
I don't know. Probably
by the weekend, okay?

01:13.213 --> 01:15.557
But my birthday's the
day after tomorrow.

01:16.133 --> 01:17.350
Oh, God.

01:17.843 --> 01:20.279
I'm sorry. Look, I promise
I'll make it up to you, okay?

01:20.303 --> 01:21.197
How?

01:21.221 --> 01:23.732
Will you listen to me
for just one second?

01:25.434 --> 01:27.870
You are going down there to
bring back a drug addict.

01:27.894 --> 01:29.372
How can that seem like
a good idea to you?

01:29.396 --> 01:31.290
You know what, Charlie? You've
never even tried to understand.

01:31.314 --> 01:32.532
Yes, I did!

01:32.733 --> 01:35.410
But my God, Bay, you
cannot change her.

01:36.111 --> 01:38.079
- You've tried everything.
- No, I haven't.

01:38.321 --> 01:41.384
I mean, yeah, I've given her
ultimatums and I've criticized her

01:41.408 --> 01:43.043
and I told on her,
but I never tried...

01:43.535 --> 01:45.462
I don't know, just
being a friend.

01:46.163 --> 01:49.183
I never said to her that no matter what
happens, I'd still care about her,

01:49.207 --> 01:51.259
and that is a huge thing
not to have told her,

01:51.376 --> 01:53.094
because I think if
she knows that,

01:53.795 --> 01:55.263
then she'll want to come back,

01:56.131 --> 01:58.141
and if she knows that, I
think she'll want to stop.

01:59.176 --> 02:01.404
Bay, doesn't that sound
just a little crazy to you?

02:01.428 --> 02:02.604
Of course it is.

02:03.513 --> 02:04.407
He's completely insane.

02:04.431 --> 02:06.983
I mean, nothing... Nothing
gets through to you anymore.

02:07.309 --> 02:08.411
It doesn't matter what she does.

02:08.435 --> 02:10.235
It obviously doesn't
matter what I say.

02:10.979 --> 02:12.197
He just doesn't get it.

02:13.607 --> 02:15.126
All right, look, I'm going,

02:15.150 --> 02:18.296
but before I do, let me thank each and
every one of you for your support.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.454

Hi.

03:46.366 --> 03:47.750
What are you doing here?

03:48.076 --> 03:50.420
I, uh... I talked to Michelle.

03:50.662 --> 03:52.672
Damn her. She told
you I was here?

03:53.415 --> 03:55.893
Who else knows? My mom too?

03:55.917 --> 03:57.051
No.

03:57.919 --> 04:00.305
So I guess you're just here
to take a urine sample.

04:02.465 --> 04:03.850
I know you're still mad,

04:04.509 --> 04:06.478
but I was back home and I
was trying to figure out

04:06.553 --> 04:08.698
how things got so... So bad.

04:08.722 --> 04:11.117
You know, it's like... It's like
we got off track or something.

04:11.141 --> 04:15.862
I don't know exactly how
or exactly when, but...

04:16.730 --> 04:17.906
Jill.

04:19.608 --> 04:20.950
Jill, wait.

04:21.151 --> 04:22.494
Will you listen?

04:28.533 --> 04:30.001

05:08.865 --> 05:10.458
Hey, Julia. How've you been?

05:10.575 --> 05:12.293
Oh, she's spectacular.

05:12.369 --> 05:16.047
She's got a new boyfriend, shooting

05:16.498 --> 05:18.258
Me? I'm stuck in a retrograde.

05:19.251 --> 05:20.186
You want coffee?

05:20.210 --> 05:21.386
Yeah.

05:22.295 --> 05:24.357
Hey, uh, listen, every
time I play now,

05:24.381 --> 05:26.234
someone's always asking me
to play that song we wrote.

05:26.258 --> 05:27.276
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.487
It's like my own, personal
"Freebird" or something.

05:29.511 --> 05:31.271
Cool.

05:31.680 --> 05:34.566
So my idea was we
should write some more.

05:35.183 --> 05:36.744
We could, I guess.

05:36.768 --> 05:39.747
Because I think the only difference between
us and real songwriters is discipline.

05:39.771 --> 05:41.791
I think they just sit their
butts down and do it.

05:41.815 --> 05:42.792
Really? You think so?

05:42.816 --> 05:46.087
If we get together 10 or 12
really good songs, make a demo,

05:46.111 --> 05:47.213
we could start
shopping it around.

05:47.237 --> 05:48.997
- Shop what around?
- What do you say?

05:49.030 --> 05:49.966
About what?

05:49.990 --> 05:51.384
I don't know. I'll
think about it.

05:51.408 --> 05:52.802
- Great.
- What?

05:52.826 --> 05:54.002
Thank you.

05:56.037 --> 05:58.298
Wow. This retrograde
stuff's brutal.

06:06.172 --> 06:09.017
What starts with a five and
ends with three zeros?

06:11.052 --> 06:12.729
Baby's first paycheck!

06:13.680 --> 06:14.856
Yes!

06:14.973 --> 06:15.866
We're rich!

06:15.890 --> 06:17.442
Well, we're not broke.

06:17.475 --> 06:18.693
We're not broke!

06:19.019 --> 06:21.956
Well, 3,000 of that goes right
back into the business.

06:21.980 --> 06:23.874
Leaving us 1,000 each.

06:23.898 --> 06:24.875
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes.

06:24.899 --> 06:27.201
And, and, and, and, and...
get this, get this.

06:27.402 --> 06:30.246
I'm at Perry's, I'm delivering
the sample table, right?

06:30.405 --> 06:33.342
And it just so happens that
standing there next to me,

06:33.366 --> 06:37.263
admiring my stunning designs
and your skilled handiwork,

06:37.287 --> 06:39.682
is a buyer from Cromwell's.

06:39.706 --> 06:40.975
He wants one too?

06:40.999 --> 06:42.550
He wants eight.

06:43.752 --> 06:45.470
- Are you kidding?
- Yeah!

06:47.130 --> 06:49.182
By, uh, the first of the month.

06:50.175 --> 06:51.110
Uh-oh.

06:51.134 --> 06:54.687
I know, I know, I know, I
know, but I had to say yes.

06:56.306 --> 06:59.275
Now, he also wants
to see our brochure.

06:59.851 --> 07:01.829
Damn. I knew we should've
had those done by now.

07:01.853 --> 07:06.032
Oh, Charlie. We've got
to get on this stuff.

07:11.738 --> 07:14.666
He made me promise I'd
stay out of the shed.

07:16.284 --> 07:17.887
You know what that means.

07:17.911 --> 07:19.545
Birthday present.

07:19.996 --> 07:22.215
Birthday present.

07:22.374 --> 07:23.716
What do you think it is?

07:24.167 --> 07:26.604
Well, there's one thing
I get every year.

07:26.628 --> 07:28.638
It's a family
tradition, I think,

07:29.506 --> 07:31.400
but that's really small.

07:31.424 --> 07:32.985
Yeah. No. No.

07:33.009 --> 07:35.853
It's got to be something so big
he has to hide it in the shed.

07:36.429 --> 07:37.782
Well, I have been
dropping a lot of hints

07:37.806 --> 07:39.533
about my bike being too small.

07:39.557 --> 07:41.150
A new bike would fit in there.

07:41.267 --> 07:44.362
I also mentioned I wanted
to try snowboarding.

07:45.021 --> 07:46.989
Hey, maybe it's both.

07:50.485 --> 07:52.245
- Danny.
- So, you decided?

07:53.321 --> 07:54.215
About what?

07:54.239 --> 07:56.165
About us working together.
What do you think?

07:56.991 --> 07:58.918
Well, you just asked
me this afternoon.

07:59.661 --> 08:01.462
So, what, you haven't
thought about it?

08:01.830 --> 08:02.723
Well, no.

08:02.747 --> 08:05.184
I have had a couple of other
things to think about since then.

08:05.208 --> 08:06.968
Oh, well, excuse me.

08:08.420 --> 08:10.138
Wait a minute. Are you mad?

08:10.296 --> 08:13.067
Just don't say you're gonna do something,
Julia, unless you're gonna do it,

08:13.091 --> 08:15.111
because I don't want to
waste time waiting around.

08:15.135 --> 08:17.270
Waste time? It's been six hours.

08:18.012 --> 08:18.906
Forget it.

08:18.930 --> 08:19.824
- Hold on.
- No, forget it.

08:19.848 --> 08:20.741
- Don't leave.
- Forget it.

08:20.765 --> 08:22.942
- Would you relax for a second?
- I'm relaxed.

08:23.476 --> 08:24.694
I'm relaxed.

08:25.687 --> 08:26.872
What's going on with you?

08:26.896 --> 08:29.375
I mean, is there something else I
did or something you're mad about?

08:29.399 --> 08:30.292
No. No.

08:30.316 --> 08:31.784
'Cause you're not
making any sense.

08:33.193 --> 08:34.328
I'm not?

08:39.033 --> 08:40.793
No. I'm not. I guess I'm not.

08:43.955 --> 08:45.339
Danny, what's wrong with you?

08:48.042 --> 08:49.385
How long has he known?

08:49.502 --> 08:50.636
A couple of months.

08:52.464 --> 08:54.348
No chance it's a false positive?

08:55.300 --> 08:56.893
He's done it three times.

08:57.177 --> 08:59.155
You know, the last time
he was at the hospital,

08:59.179 --> 09:02.231
he overheard some doctors
joking about it.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.119
They call them "high-fivers."

09:05.143 --> 09:06.662
"H-I" for high, and...

09:06.686 --> 09:08.237
And "V" for five.

09:08.646 --> 09:09.781
God.

09:11.941 --> 09:13.284
How awful.

09:15.403 --> 09:16.662
How's he seem?

09:17.155 --> 09:18.664
You know what's weird?

09:20.033 --> 09:21.709
Not as bad as you'd think.

09:22.410 --> 09:23.711
Right.

09:23.953 --> 09:26.589
But at the same time,
see, he's always been

09:27.290 --> 09:30.092
kind of low key. Really lazy.

09:30.919 --> 09:32.929
Never finishes
anything, you know?

09:33.963 --> 09:38.611
And now, all of a sudden he's got
all this energy and commitment.

09:38.635 --> 09:40.905
Warning! Birthday girl alert!

09:40.929 --> 09:43.981
If you're talking about my
party, you'd better shut up.

09:44.557 --> 09:46.275
Okay, I've got it.

09:46.476 --> 09:49.403
You're taking me and all
my friends to the zoo.

09:50.855 --> 09:53.533
You're renting a big sailboat?

09:56.194 --> 09:57.370
Darn.

09:57.612 --> 09:58.871
You guys are too good.

09:59.739 --> 10:01.258
Oh, God, her birthday.

10:01.282 --> 10:02.676
I have no time.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.178
Me neither, but
somebody's got to do it.

10:04.202 --> 10:05.753
Maybe we can hire someone.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.422
Aren't there people that do that?
Put parties together?

10:09.374 --> 10:11.050
It would make life easier.

10:11.626 --> 10:15.064
I promised Danny I'd get started
on some new lyrics right away.

10:15.088 --> 10:17.441
So you're gonna do it.
You're gonna work with him.

10:17.465 --> 10:18.641
Of course.

10:19.676 --> 10:21.936
God, I have to. It's
the least I can do.

10:24.931 --> 10:25.824
How much?

10:25.848 --> 10:27.066
Five bucks.

10:36.609 --> 10:38.411
I played hockey in
those things once.

10:39.529 --> 10:42.258
Took a puck in the face. Had a
black eye for, like, a week.

10:42.282 --> 10:44.208
I thought you'd be gone by now.

10:44.617 --> 10:47.295
No, I figured I'd stick
around, see the sights.

10:47.704 --> 10:49.505
Well, hope you had a nice day.

10:49.539 --> 10:52.133
Yeah. Yeah. It was great.

10:54.085 --> 10:56.730
This couple from Wisconsin followed
me around for, like, an hour.

10:56.754 --> 10:58.890
Turns out they thought
I was Tom Cruise.

10:59.549 --> 11:03.153
They wouldn't leave me alone till
they took a picture with me.

11:03.177 --> 11:04.520
What do you want, Bailey?

11:07.056 --> 11:08.608
I want you to come back with me.

11:08.766 --> 11:09.952
Forget it.

11:09.976 --> 11:12.069
Look... Look, I'm sorry.

11:12.687 --> 11:14.957
I shouldn't have gone behind your back.
That was wrong and I know that,

11:14.981 --> 11:17.533
but is that a good reason
just to junk everything?

11:17.942 --> 11:19.660
Because things were good, Jill.

11:20.111 --> 11:21.871
In the beginning,
things were great.

11:22.905 --> 11:25.583
Don't... Please, don't
go back in there.

11:27.327 --> 11:28.919
Listen, I know...

11:30.038 --> 11:31.807
I know everything I've
done this last month

11:31.831 --> 11:34.884
has made you feel like
I'm judging you and...

11:34.959 --> 11:37.771
And made you think that you
can't trust me, but I promise,

11:37.795 --> 11:39.722
if we started over, everything
would be different.

11:40.465 --> 11:41.849
I wouldn't judge.

11:43.092 --> 11:45.936
I wouldn't go behind your back.
I would just be your friend,

11:46.971 --> 11:49.950
but I don't know how
to prove that to you.

11:49.974 --> 11:54.330
I mean, yeah, I can say
I'm sorry, I love you,

11:54.354 --> 11:58.208
and all I want is just to
be with you and hold you

11:58.232 --> 11:59.585
and smell your hair again,

11:59.609 --> 12:02.463
but then I think after
everything that's happened,

12:02.487 --> 12:03.954
what good would that do?

12:05.406 --> 12:06.666
What did you say?

12:07.700 --> 12:09.085
What good would that do?

12:10.328 --> 12:12.421
No. Before that.

12:14.874 --> 12:17.677
Uh, which part? It was
kind of a long speech.

12:19.754 --> 12:21.597
The part about "I love you."

12:23.841 --> 12:26.060
Oh. That part.

12:27.553 --> 12:28.729
Did you mean it?

12:32.642 --> 12:33.984
Well, I said it...

12:35.561 --> 12:36.946
So...

12:38.648 --> 12:40.032
I mean, it just came out...

12:41.734 --> 12:42.910
So yeah.

12:44.278 --> 12:46.122
So I think, yeah.

12:48.825 --> 12:50.209
I love you.

12:54.038 --> 12:55.798
Do you think maybe
you love me too?

13:06.134 --> 13:07.893
Are you gonna come home with me?

13:29.782 --> 13:32.835
Okay. Got coffee, got doughnuts.

13:34.454 --> 13:36.807
You're in charge of
music and navigation,

13:36.831 --> 13:41.311
so find us a good radio
station and the Five freeway.

13:41.335 --> 13:42.511
The Five?

13:42.920 --> 13:44.889
No, let's take Route 1.

13:44.964 --> 13:46.066
What, up the coast?

13:46.090 --> 13:47.391
Yeah. Why not?

13:47.967 --> 13:50.320
Because the Five's like a
third of the driving time.

13:50.344 --> 13:52.855
Yeah, nothing but garlic
fields the whole way.

13:52.972 --> 13:54.440
Boring and stinky.

13:54.891 --> 13:57.443
Now, look. Look at what we'll
see if we take the coast.

13:57.977 --> 13:59.361
Santa Barbara.

13:59.645 --> 14:00.988
Ooh, Monterey.

14:02.231 --> 14:03.542
Hearst Castle.

14:03.566 --> 14:05.586
Haven't you always wanted
to see Hearst Castle?

14:05.610 --> 14:08.130
The place on the cliff with,
like, a bazillion rooms?

14:08.154 --> 14:11.049
Mmm-hmm. We can be like James Dean and
Natalie Wood in that movie we saw.

14:11.073 --> 14:12.301
<i>Rebel Without a Cause.</i>

14:12.325 --> 14:14.960
Young, in love,

14:15.369 --> 14:17.838
traipsing around a
big, old mansion.

14:18.331 --> 14:20.841
Come on. It'll be romantic.

14:26.047 --> 14:27.566
I guess we're already
going to miss school.

14:27.590 --> 14:28.734
Yay!

14:28.758 --> 14:29.818
All right.

14:29.842 --> 14:31.435
All right. All right.

14:32.428 --> 14:33.562
Okay.

14:42.355 --> 14:43.582
Do you have the balance sheet?

14:43.606 --> 14:44.541
Yes.

14:44.565 --> 14:45.876
Oh, thank God. Charlie,
I need your help.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.211
I've been up all night.
You got a sec?

14:47.235 --> 14:49.495
Um, not really. No.

14:49.529 --> 14:51.423
We have a meeting with our
loan officer at nine.

14:51.447 --> 14:54.259
Please. I promised Danny I'd drop
some lyrics off this morning

14:54.283 --> 14:57.294
and I have hardly anything. I
just need a starting point.

14:57.995 --> 15:01.132
Okay, um, start the car.
I'll be there in one minute.

15:01.332 --> 15:02.550
Okay, but hurry.

15:02.708 --> 15:04.051
Okay. Thank you.

15:05.169 --> 15:08.764
Okay, um, tell me, uh...

15:08.840 --> 15:09.900
Tell me...

15:09.924 --> 15:13.060
How you feel about, um, Kirsten.

15:14.345 --> 15:15.521
What?

15:17.056 --> 15:18.732
How does she make you feel?

15:19.809 --> 15:21.235
Uh...

15:21.310 --> 15:22.204
Okay.

15:22.228 --> 15:23.779
She, um... How does
she make me feel?

15:23.938 --> 15:25.406
Um...

15:26.774 --> 15:27.950
Good.

15:28.985 --> 15:30.661
Good? That's it?

15:32.154 --> 15:33.298
I don't know.

15:33.322 --> 15:35.457
Okay, um, forget it.
Too personal.

15:36.242 --> 15:37.501
Your work.

15:37.660 --> 15:41.881
You're making a desk and you
look at it, and you feel...

15:45.334 --> 15:47.469
- Good.
- Good? Charlie...

15:47.628 --> 15:50.097
I'm sorry. That is
the best I can do.

15:52.091 --> 15:53.601
Oh, listen, um...

15:54.343 --> 15:56.729
I'm going to have to go in on your present.
I haven't had time.

15:57.555 --> 15:58.981
Oh, my God.

15:59.599 --> 16:00.951
You didn't get her
anything either?

16:00.975 --> 16:02.985
Lay off. At least I got
the party planner.

16:03.936 --> 16:06.280
Okay. Look, uh...

16:08.232 --> 16:13.547
Okay. I'll sign a check, and you go down
after school and you get her something.

16:13.571 --> 16:15.998
Okay. Like what?

16:16.449 --> 16:18.093
I don't know, just
something expensive,

16:18.117 --> 16:19.428
and we'll give it
to her tonight.

16:19.452 --> 16:20.888
We always get presents
at breakfast.

16:20.912 --> 16:22.379
She'll be expecting
it this morning.

16:22.788 --> 16:25.257
So we'll just have to avoid
her until you get back.

16:25.666 --> 16:27.051
Avoid her on her birthday?

16:27.960 --> 16:29.470
Have you got a better idea?

16:37.511 --> 16:38.729
So...

16:39.180 --> 16:40.856
So wait. I don't get it.

16:41.474 --> 16:43.785
They told you what kind
of party it's gonna be,

16:43.809 --> 16:46.111
and you go and plan it?

16:46.354 --> 16:48.582
Actually, no. You get to tell me

16:48.606 --> 16:51.075
what you have in mind
for the big event.

16:51.359 --> 16:56.131
So, what you're saying is if I want
a party, I have to plan it myself?

16:56.155 --> 16:59.917
Oh, now, let's not get all fussy-fussy.
This is gonna be fun.

17:00.117 --> 17:03.254
Why don't you tell me when
the actual birthday is.

17:03.412 --> 17:04.630
Today.

17:05.039 --> 17:07.017
Today!

17:07.040 --> 17:11.011
Well, happy birthday,
birthday girl.

17:14.173 --> 17:16.568
It says here Hearst Castle
costs 25 bucks apiece.

17:16.592 --> 17:18.227
Where are we gonna get 50 bucks?

17:18.636 --> 17:19.655
I could write a bad check.

17:19.679 --> 17:21.105
Oh, I could pawn my earrings.

17:21.555 --> 17:23.065
I could rob a liquor store.

17:23.516 --> 17:25.401
I could sell my body.

17:28.020 --> 17:29.196
Company.

17:33.859 --> 17:35.619
License and
registration, please.

17:40.408 --> 17:41.959
She gonna be all right?

17:42.159 --> 17:43.460
I, uh...

17:43.786 --> 17:46.088
Just... Our big brother.

17:46.372 --> 17:47.724
Our favorite brother...

17:47.748 --> 17:51.895
He, um, D...

17:51.919 --> 17:53.095
Damian.

17:53.295 --> 17:54.638
He was...

17:54.797 --> 17:58.527
He was skin diving off the coast
of Catalina like he always does.

17:58.551 --> 18:01.228
Yeah. He's very outdoorsy.

18:01.470 --> 18:02.604
Was.

18:03.305 --> 18:04.606
Was outdoorsy.

18:04.640 --> 18:05.816
Was.

18:05.975 --> 18:08.537
See, that's the hardest
thing, you know,

18:08.561 --> 18:11.405
is thinking of him as gone.

18:11.772 --> 18:13.875
I hope that shark burns in hell!

18:13.899 --> 18:15.419
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Easy. Easy.

18:15.443 --> 18:16.827
Okay, okay.

18:17.236 --> 18:18.454
Shh.

18:19.405 --> 18:22.082
I think the funeral will be
very good for her, you know?

18:23.868 --> 18:25.294
Nice try, kids.

18:26.996 --> 18:29.131
Extra points for creativity?

18:29.790 --> 18:31.008
Yes?

18:31.792 --> 18:33.010
No?

18:33.085 --> 18:34.678
The shark was a nice touch.

18:37.173 --> 18:40.225
♪ <i>Happy birthday Dear Claudia</i> ♪

18:40.259 --> 18:43.145
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

18:43.471 --> 18:44.698
It's from a store.

18:44.722 --> 18:46.982
But look, it's got a little
violin, just for you.

18:47.516 --> 18:48.859
That's a cello.

18:49.060 --> 18:51.278
And they forgot the U.

18:51.437 --> 18:53.322
"Happy birthday...

18:53.481 --> 18:54.698
Cladia"?

18:55.941 --> 18:57.242
Cladia?

18:59.737 --> 19:01.590
One present from two people?

19:01.614 --> 19:03.091
Don't they know
that's a rip-off?

19:03.115 --> 19:06.001
What do you expect from people
who hire a party planner?

19:06.952 --> 19:09.588
It's the one all the
professional photographers use.

19:09.914 --> 19:14.728
Great. I'll, um, use it for all the
professional photography I do.

19:14.752 --> 19:16.470
This paper stock
is half the price?

19:16.504 --> 19:19.149
Yeah, but if we have to
reduce the pictures way down,

19:19.173 --> 19:20.776
I don't know if we'll be
able to see the detail.

19:20.800 --> 19:21.902
I've got it! I've got it!

19:21.926 --> 19:23.153
No, Artie. It's the flash.

19:23.177 --> 19:25.896
No, it's not. It's the motor drive.
It says right here.

19:27.765 --> 19:29.024
Claud, um...

19:29.308 --> 19:31.068
Mind if Gwen and I take off?

19:31.268 --> 19:33.153
Hey, why would I mind?

19:35.189 --> 19:36.407
I'll get it.

19:38.442 --> 19:39.868
I hate my family.

19:40.528 --> 19:43.298
Okay, this is the thing. My
roommate, you met her that night...

19:43.322 --> 19:44.257
Ann.

19:44.281 --> 19:45.842
She's an engineer at
a recording studio,

19:45.866 --> 19:48.762
and the guys that booked time this
week bagged for tomorrow night,

19:48.786 --> 19:50.180
and she said that I
could have the time.

19:50.204 --> 19:51.463
Free.

19:51.747 --> 19:53.225
So, that's great.

19:53.249 --> 19:56.561
Yeah, it would be if I
had anything to sing.

19:56.585 --> 19:57.646
These lyrics, Julia.

19:57.670 --> 19:59.096
You couldn't have been trying.

19:59.839 --> 20:01.566
Well, I was. It's just...

20:01.590 --> 20:05.310
"Working with wood
makes me feel good."

20:06.679 --> 20:08.188
All right, so it isn't perfect.

20:08.848 --> 20:10.065
It's garbage.

20:14.478 --> 20:15.872
Nope. It's not good enough.

20:15.896 --> 20:17.082
Oh, come on. It's good.

20:17.106 --> 20:18.875
Yeah, but it's got nothing
to do with the music.

20:18.899 --> 20:20.043
It's like you're not
even listening!

20:20.067 --> 20:21.586
Don't yell at me.
It's not helping.

20:21.610 --> 20:23.328
Okay. Fine.

20:25.197 --> 20:26.373
Just listen.

20:33.330 --> 20:35.048
It's the best thing
I've ever written,

20:35.291 --> 20:37.894
and crappy lyrics
are gonna ruin it.

20:37.918 --> 20:39.428
Julia! Phone!

20:39.545 --> 20:40.480
It's Justin.

20:40.504 --> 20:41.680
She'll call him back!

20:42.464 --> 20:43.682
Let's go.

20:45.217 --> 20:48.280
Look, Danny, it's midnight. I have
to get up early for school, okay?

20:48.304 --> 20:49.438
No.

20:50.806 --> 20:53.358
Julia, I don't care
what time it is. No.

21:00.941 --> 21:02.127
The lady at the front desk

21:02.151 --> 21:04.671
didn't even blink when you
signed in as James Dean.

21:04.695 --> 21:05.913
Ow! Ow.

21:06.488 --> 21:08.415
She's probably used to aliases.

21:08.490 --> 21:09.875
This is a motel.

21:14.121 --> 21:17.341
I always thought it would be
really sexy to stay in a motel.

21:27.134 --> 21:28.519
Oh.

21:29.345 --> 21:30.530
Well...

21:30.554 --> 21:31.772
What?

21:32.932 --> 21:34.483
I don't know, I guess, uh...

21:34.892 --> 21:36.735
I guess I hoped it would
be a little nicer.

21:38.270 --> 21:40.113
Nicer than this?

21:42.107 --> 21:43.367
This...

21:43.901 --> 21:45.494
This is gorgeous.

21:45.819 --> 21:49.706
I mean, look at the decor.

21:50.908 --> 21:52.459
Priceless antiques.

21:52.910 --> 21:54.586
Oh...

21:55.287 --> 21:57.422
Treasures from the sea.

21:58.165 --> 22:02.636
Oh, and this bedspread. Is
this Chinese silk or Indian?

22:02.962 --> 22:05.430
Ah. Definitely Chinese.

22:07.216 --> 22:10.153
Didn't we have the same chandelier
in our room when we were in Paris?

22:10.177 --> 22:11.279
Did we?

22:11.303 --> 22:12.697
I'm almost certain.

22:12.721 --> 22:14.523
Hmm. I don't remember.

22:15.140 --> 22:17.943
I must've been on top
most of that trip.

22:18.894 --> 22:20.112
Well...

22:20.980 --> 22:22.656
Then I guess it's my turn.

22:28.570 --> 22:29.788
Hey.

22:32.157 --> 22:33.625
It's perfect.

22:43.168 --> 22:44.886
It's been great, Char.

22:45.546 --> 22:47.389
No. Zero problems.

22:49.508 --> 22:51.101
I told you I could do it.

22:52.594 --> 22:55.490
Well, no. Not any definite
plans or anything,

22:55.514 --> 22:57.899
but we'll talk about
it when we get home.

22:58.892 --> 22:59.869
Trust me.

22:59.893 --> 23:01.778
I'll deal with it, okay?
Just not right now.

23:03.105 --> 23:05.166
Um, I think we're just...

23:05.190 --> 23:07.492
We're about four hours
away, just down the coast.

23:08.652 --> 23:10.829
Right. I'll see you then.

23:22.958 --> 23:24.102
You awake?

23:24.126 --> 23:25.844
Mmm.

23:26.503 --> 23:27.929
Morning.

23:31.050 --> 23:32.476
Where are we?

23:32.634 --> 23:33.935
Santa Cruz.

23:36.096 --> 23:37.814
Santa Cruz has a boardwalk.

23:38.098 --> 23:39.900
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

23:41.143 --> 23:42.402
Yeah.

23:42.686 --> 23:44.446
Let's hang out on the
boardwalk today.

23:45.230 --> 23:47.491
I just told Charlie
we'd be back by lunch.

23:48.150 --> 23:51.328
So, just call him and tell
him we'll be back tomorrow.

23:53.238 --> 23:54.748
Oh, come on.

23:54.823 --> 23:57.000
We've been having so much fun.

23:58.994 --> 24:00.504
What's one more day?

24:01.955 --> 24:03.173
I guess I just...

24:03.457 --> 24:06.051
Thought that maybe it was
time to get back to reality.

24:11.173 --> 24:12.349
Trust me.

24:13.717 --> 24:15.602
Reality isn't going anywhere.

24:27.606 --> 24:30.659
I'm really sorry, but I've
given this a lot of thought.

24:31.443 --> 24:34.746
I really wish you'd reconsider.

24:35.114 --> 24:36.706
I don't need to, thank you.

24:36.782 --> 24:38.083
My mind's made up.

24:39.326 --> 24:41.596
This is in no way a
reflection of your work.

24:41.620 --> 24:45.006
It's just that, well, I
don't want a party at all.

24:45.415 --> 24:48.353
After all the work we did
on the color scheme?

24:48.377 --> 24:50.271
Why on earth not?

24:50.295 --> 24:51.638
Because...

24:51.672 --> 24:54.484
Probably no one would care
enough to come anyway.

24:54.508 --> 24:55.902
Now, Lamb Chop,

24:55.926 --> 24:58.353
I've spoken to your
brother and sister,

24:58.512 --> 25:01.908
and judging from the amount they were
willing to spend on your celebration,

25:01.932 --> 25:04.661
I'd say they care a great deal.

25:04.685 --> 25:07.446
Money isn't love, Lady Jane,

25:08.272 --> 25:09.823
and, um...

25:10.107 --> 25:12.117
Don't call me Lamb Chop.

25:13.944 --> 25:15.912
Can I get the meatloaf special?

25:16.113 --> 25:18.383
An Elvis impersonator's
playing on the beach tonight.

25:18.407 --> 25:20.709
Oh, let's go. It'll be fun.

25:20.826 --> 25:23.179
Yeah, like the roller
coaster was fun,

25:23.203 --> 25:26.256
and the Skee-Ball was fun and
the bumper cars were fun.

25:26.415 --> 25:27.559
What's wrong?

25:27.583 --> 25:29.519
I just want to get home.

25:29.543 --> 25:32.438
I've been wearing the same underwear
for three days. Let's go home, Jill.

25:32.462 --> 25:33.940
So, you folks know
what you want?

25:33.964 --> 25:35.307
I want to go home.

25:35.465 --> 25:39.445
No, um, uh, cheeseburger,
medium, with fries, please.

25:39.469 --> 25:41.906
Same for me, uh, Mary Elizabeth.

25:41.930 --> 25:43.231
And to drink?

25:44.141 --> 25:45.567
Do you have a wine list?

25:45.642 --> 25:48.361
Oh, uh, we have a house
red and a house white.

25:48.937 --> 25:50.655
We'll have a bottle
of the house red.

25:57.571 --> 26:00.123
You know, James Dean is a
really good name for you.

26:00.532 --> 26:03.376
Maybe we should just change our names
officially. What do you think?

26:03.577 --> 26:05.712
James and Natalie. Hmm?

26:06.663 --> 26:09.341
It's so much better
than Bill and Jailey.

26:11.460 --> 26:12.979
- Jill and Bailey.
- Right.

26:13.003 --> 26:15.430
Boring, boring, boring, boring.

26:17.382 --> 26:18.683
Hey, Bailey.

26:28.977 --> 26:32.030
I called all over for a place for
the party. Everything was booked.

26:32.272 --> 26:34.616
Even the bowling alleys?

26:35.192 --> 26:36.368
League night.

26:37.486 --> 26:38.620
Ah.

26:40.781 --> 26:41.998
So...

26:42.115 --> 26:44.167
Salinger's, where she
eats every week.

26:45.786 --> 26:48.630
Come on. It's not that big a deal.
I mean...

26:48.664 --> 26:50.966
She'll have her party,
she'll be happy.

26:51.792 --> 26:54.177
Very sensitive, Charlie.
Very responsible.

26:55.504 --> 26:56.606
Well, make up your mind.

26:56.630 --> 26:59.234
Is this the sensitivity lecture
or the responsibility lecture?

26:59.258 --> 27:00.610
I'm just saying, you
should have thought...

27:00.634 --> 27:02.111
Hey, I thought, okay?

27:02.135 --> 27:04.572
I thought about brochures
and about accounts payable

27:04.596 --> 27:06.439
and filling this
order by next month.

27:07.683 --> 27:08.858
Great.

27:11.478 --> 27:12.654
Hey.

27:14.982 --> 27:17.325
You know how many of my birthdays
my dad was around for?

27:18.235 --> 27:19.786
Zero, none,

27:20.654 --> 27:22.966
because Mom always gave us our
presents in the morning before school,

27:22.990 --> 27:24.968
and since Dad had to
leave every day at 6:00

27:24.992 --> 27:27.419
to go buy produce for the
restaurant, he'd miss it,

27:27.869 --> 27:29.597
and then we'd do cake
at night, after dinner,

27:29.621 --> 27:32.924
but, of course, Dad was at Salinger's
till midnight, so he'd miss that too,

27:33.292 --> 27:34.269
and you know what?

27:34.293 --> 27:37.887
No one ever accused him of being a
bad parent or neglecting his family.

27:37.963 --> 27:41.766
In fact they'd say the opposite.
"Nick works so hard for those kids."

27:43.719 --> 27:47.105
Don't call him selfish because he wanted
to make a success out of his life.

27:48.765 --> 27:50.650
He was a great father.

27:55.856 --> 27:59.377
<i>♪ Do-do da-de-ah Da da da-da ♪</i>

27:59.401 --> 28:03.548
<i>♪ De-da da-de-ah Da da da-da ♪</i>

28:03.572 --> 28:08.835
<i>♪ De-da da-de-ah Da da da-da ♪</i>

28:10.537 --> 28:11.472
Well?

28:11.496 --> 28:12.839
The bass is too high.

28:12.873 --> 28:15.508
We'll fix it later. You want
to do a little singing?

28:15.834 --> 28:19.304
I don't know. Julia, do I
want to do a little singing?

28:19.338 --> 28:20.555
Hmm?

28:21.590 --> 28:23.558
Forget it. I'm gonna come in.

28:27.637 --> 28:29.189
- What do you got?
- No, wait.

28:32.309 --> 28:33.443
What is this?

28:34.394 --> 28:35.570
Trig.

28:39.024 --> 28:40.325
Uh, soda anyone?

28:41.526 --> 28:42.702
Right.

28:46.615 --> 28:47.759
I have a test.

28:47.783 --> 28:49.052
Oh, well...

28:49.076 --> 28:51.429
And I was gonna study last
night, but you came over.

28:51.453 --> 28:54.589
And you went to sleep without
writing one good lyric.

28:55.749 --> 28:57.676
Well, I'm sorry, but it's hard.

28:58.168 --> 28:59.354
This is important.

28:59.378 --> 29:02.065
Well, I know that, but there are
other things that are important too.

29:02.089 --> 29:04.233
Like what? Like Trig?

29:04.257 --> 29:06.152
- No.
- Well, then what? Tell me.

29:06.176 --> 29:09.947
Well, I know this is gonna sound stupid
to you, but I do have a new boyfriend

29:09.971 --> 29:11.449
who I haven't even
seen in three days.

29:11.473 --> 29:12.992
Oh, God, a boyfriend.

29:13.016 --> 29:14.901
And yesterday was my
sister's birthday.

29:15.686 --> 29:17.320
What do you think
this is, Julia?

29:17.521 --> 29:18.947
Some part-time gig?

29:19.064 --> 29:21.574
When you feel like it, you
can throw some poems my way?

29:22.693 --> 29:25.421
That's not how it works.
We gotta work hard.

29:25.445 --> 29:27.131
We gotta put together a demo,

29:27.155 --> 29:29.425
we gotta go to L.A., we
gotta shop it around...

29:29.449 --> 29:31.135
L.A.? Danny, I'm 15.

29:31.159 --> 29:32.428
So what? When Mozart was...

29:32.452 --> 29:33.837
I'm not Mozart.

29:34.204 --> 29:36.673
I wrote one poem that
you liked, that's it,

29:37.416 --> 29:41.062
and now you expect me to be brilliant every
second to make everything better for you.

29:41.086 --> 29:43.304
It's like you want me to
save your life or something.

29:44.297 --> 29:45.974
But I just can't do that.

29:46.633 --> 29:47.934
I just can't.

29:50.220 --> 29:54.899
Danny, I'd do anything to change what has
happened to you, I swear, but I can't.

29:56.768 --> 29:59.571
And what you're asking me
to do, well, it's too hard.

30:09.156 --> 30:11.875
Fine. You should go.

30:12.367 --> 30:14.053
I'm not saying I want to leave.

30:14.077 --> 30:14.971
No, no, no, no.

30:14.995 --> 30:17.765
You have so many important things to
do, Julia. You should just go do them.

30:17.789 --> 30:18.683
Danny...

30:18.707 --> 30:19.924
Get out of here.

30:29.843 --> 30:30.987
Turn it off.

30:31.011 --> 30:32.228
I need to see.

30:44.775 --> 30:46.367
Look what you made me do.

30:49.321 --> 30:50.455
What?

30:52.616 --> 30:53.833
Go on, say it.

30:54.910 --> 30:56.294
Why are you doing this?

30:57.162 --> 30:58.671
Why are you ruining everything?

31:00.290 --> 31:02.801
You're the one sitting at
dinner like a freaking nun.

31:02.834 --> 31:05.678
I'm watching you get drunker by the second.
What did you want me to do?

31:05.754 --> 31:07.982
I want you to lay off, like
you said you were going to.

31:08.006 --> 31:09.766
I did lay off, but it's like...

31:09.925 --> 31:11.861
It's like you're
trying to make me mad.

31:11.885 --> 31:14.604
"Everything will be different this time.
I promise."

31:15.722 --> 31:17.273
Bunch of crap.

31:17.891 --> 31:19.109
It was different.

31:19.518 --> 31:20.735
It was great.

31:21.061 --> 31:23.748
Meanwhile, you're telling Charlie
what a big hero you are.

31:23.772 --> 31:24.906
What?

31:26.691 --> 31:27.710
That wasn't what I said.

31:27.734 --> 31:28.920
Are you calling my mom too?

31:28.944 --> 31:29.879
No!

31:29.903 --> 31:32.956
Oh, we're gonna get home, and it's
gonna be exactly the same, won't it?

31:32.989 --> 31:36.385
You on your high horse, telling me
how to live my life, Mr. Perfect.

31:36.409 --> 31:37.887
I never said that I was perfect.

31:37.911 --> 31:39.212
You know who you are?

31:39.412 --> 31:42.767
You're that guy in the cartoons, that guy who's
always saving the girl on the train tracks.

31:42.791 --> 31:43.976
The Dudley Do-Right guy.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.770
- Cut it out.
- Always the big hero,

31:45.794 --> 31:47.605
always thinks he
can save some girl

31:47.629 --> 31:49.690
- he thinks can't take care of herself.
- Shut up.

31:49.714 --> 31:51.266
That's how you should
have signed in.

31:51.716 --> 31:52.944
Bailey Do-Right.

31:52.968 --> 31:54.352
I said shut up!

32:14.531 --> 32:18.511
Look, you're drunk, and I really
don't want to talk to you right now,

32:18.535 --> 32:19.720
so I'm gonna go to sleep.

32:19.744 --> 32:20.805
When we wake up in the morning,

32:20.829 --> 32:23.381
we can talk about this all you
want, but not with you like this.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.093
Mmm-hmm?

33:41.117 --> 33:42.293
Julia?

33:43.370 --> 33:45.088
I'm sorry. Are you asleep?

33:46.081 --> 33:47.507
No. Um...

33:47.999 --> 33:49.175
No.

33:49.334 --> 33:51.678
Uh... Your little
sister let me in.

33:52.504 --> 33:53.888
I don't think she likes me.

33:54.381 --> 33:56.349
She asked me to
"state my business."

33:56.841 --> 33:58.277
She actually used those words.

33:58.301 --> 34:00.363
Oh, jeez. How weird.

34:00.387 --> 34:01.562
No. She's cool.

34:02.514 --> 34:04.075
She wouldn't, uh, tell
me where you were

34:04.099 --> 34:06.234
until I told her I was
here to apologize.

34:07.477 --> 34:08.652
Apology accepted.

34:09.187 --> 34:11.030
I haven't done it yet.

34:11.356 --> 34:14.409
I actually, uh, worked out
this whole apology number.

34:15.025 --> 34:16.995
Oh, okay.

34:21.658 --> 34:23.208
You didn't do anything wrong.

34:24.536 --> 34:26.045
It was me.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.464
I ju... It's...

34:30.583 --> 34:32.342
See, this is what's
been freaking me out.

34:35.213 --> 34:37.681
At night, when I'm
trying to go to sleep,

34:38.632 --> 34:40.351
I can't help but think...

34:41.844 --> 34:43.855
What are people going
to say about me?

34:44.681 --> 34:45.815
You know?

34:45.931 --> 34:48.192
Like... When it's over.

34:50.728 --> 34:52.405
I mean, probably not much,

34:52.522 --> 34:55.699
because why should they? It's not
like I've ever done anything,

34:56.568 --> 34:58.077
and every time I think that,

34:59.154 --> 35:02.123
I get, like, this whole
cold feeling that,

35:02.198 --> 35:04.208
goes through my body,

35:05.952 --> 35:08.671
Because I guess I want
them... You know, people...

35:09.080 --> 35:10.757
I want them to say...

35:12.333 --> 35:13.634
"Hey...

35:14.127 --> 35:15.762
"It's too bad he's gone.

35:17.464 --> 35:19.057
I'm going to miss him."

35:21.718 --> 35:27.690
And I know that music is something I
do that, that makes people feel good,

35:30.518 --> 35:34.072
and if I do it well, or, if...
as well as I can...

35:35.356 --> 35:36.866
...then, um...

35:38.151 --> 35:39.452
Maybe they'll say that.

35:41.738 --> 35:43.748
Maybe they'll miss me.

35:49.537 --> 35:52.673
But I don't think I can do it...

35:53.500 --> 35:54.884
You know, alone,

35:55.919 --> 35:58.763
because I've never really
achieved anything.

36:00.965 --> 36:03.101
And I think if it
was all up to me,

36:03.384 --> 36:04.644
I'd fail.

36:06.513 --> 36:07.688
And...

36:09.015 --> 36:10.775
I'd go away and...

36:12.727 --> 36:14.278
Nobody would care.

36:18.066 --> 36:20.451
And I don't know how I'm gonna
make sure that doesn't happen.

36:23.279 --> 36:24.497
But...

36:26.116 --> 36:27.417
It's not up to you.

36:27.742 --> 36:30.878
And I shouldn't have
acted like it was.

36:32.956 --> 36:35.341
So I... I'm sorry.

36:46.344 --> 36:48.312
You're gonna be in
detention till you're 40.

36:50.807 --> 36:52.275
I hope it was worth it.

36:55.603 --> 36:56.821
What's the matter?

36:58.148 --> 36:59.407
What happened?

37:04.237 --> 37:06.247
Just what you said was
gonna happen, okay?

37:07.991 --> 37:09.167
She split.

37:10.952 --> 37:13.055
I thought you said
everything was going great.

37:13.079 --> 37:15.006
Yeah, well, obviously,
I was wrong.

37:18.209 --> 37:21.220
She's a mess, and nothing
that I do does any good,

37:22.547 --> 37:24.932
so you were right and I was wrong.
Are you happy now?

37:28.428 --> 37:29.562
No.

37:36.769 --> 37:39.822
I tried to help but...

37:41.858 --> 37:43.326
I just made things worse.

37:46.070 --> 37:47.371
Yeah, but, Bay...

37:49.449 --> 37:50.708
It wasn't your fault.

37:53.077 --> 37:54.253
Right.

38:02.045 --> 38:03.105
Hey, Claud, I'm back.

38:03.129 --> 38:04.273
Big whoop.

38:04.297 --> 38:06.891
Hey, hang on a second. Wait!

38:08.176 --> 38:11.270
Look, I'm sorry I
missed your birthday.

38:11.971 --> 38:13.898
I wanted to be here.
It was just...

38:14.724 --> 38:16.651
- this stuff with Jill...
- Was more important.

38:17.560 --> 38:18.945
- I know.
- No.

38:19.520 --> 38:22.208
Not more important, but...

38:22.232 --> 38:23.866
I guess it seemed more urgent.

38:25.276 --> 38:26.536
I'm really sorry.

38:29.530 --> 38:30.915
Birthday present?

38:31.824 --> 38:33.042
Yeah.

38:33.326 --> 38:34.220
Who's it from?

38:34.244 --> 38:35.878
Who wasn't it from?

38:40.792 --> 38:42.051
Listen,

38:44.754 --> 38:46.523
you probably already
got one of these,

38:46.547 --> 38:50.935
and the tradition is one per
year, but I got you this anyway.

38:53.221 --> 38:54.281
Oh...

38:54.305 --> 38:55.658
It's a palm tree.

38:55.682 --> 38:58.369
You see, its little...
coconuts move.

38:58.393 --> 38:59.745
Neat!

38:59.769 --> 39:02.113
I was gonna get you a different
one of a surfboard...

39:02.146 --> 39:04.917
Oh, no. No, the palm
tree's much better.

39:04.941 --> 39:06.200
So you like it?

39:10.697 --> 39:11.590
Can you help?

39:11.614 --> 39:12.748
Yeah.

39:18.621 --> 39:19.839
You're late.

39:20.290 --> 39:22.592
- You said 6:30.
- It's 6:32.

39:22.875 --> 39:24.510
- What's two minutes?
- Shh. Listen.

39:24.711 --> 39:26.178

41:18.449 --> 41:19.583
Cool.

41:19.826 --> 41:20.969
No, Julia, it's great.

41:47.603 --> 41:49.196
I'm really sorry, Claud, but...

41:50.481 --> 41:53.033
I tried to get out of it, but I'm going
to have to cut out of here at 9.

41:53.609 --> 41:54.785
It's okay.

41:56.612 --> 41:58.789
And I promise, when I'm
up with all this work,

41:59.615 --> 42:02.168
you and I will do something just
by ourselves for your birthday.

42:02.910 --> 42:06.297
So that'll be, like, what,
when I'm 18 or something?

42:07.498 --> 42:09.550
Yeah. Around then.

42:16.716 --> 42:19.268
Claudia, let's open presents.

42:19.343 --> 42:22.313
That Bailey, I always say
he's a party animal.

42:23.014 --> 42:24.315
Don't mind me.

42:24.640 --> 42:26.317
I'm just having a
mid-life crisis.

42:27.018 --> 42:29.487
Good to get that out of the way
while you're still in your teens.

42:32.857 --> 42:34.918
I'm sure you did
everything you could, Bay.

42:34.942 --> 42:36.702
And it didn't do any good.

42:39.614 --> 42:41.791
I don't know. Maybe that's
just the way it is.

42:42.867 --> 42:47.004
Maybe there's really nothing
anyone can do for anyone else.

42:49.665 --> 42:51.226
Bay, you help people
all the time.

42:51.250 --> 42:54.261
Yeah. I mean, look what
you did for Claudia.

42:55.463 --> 42:57.014
What, blow off her birthday?

42:57.089 --> 42:59.183
Yeah, I'm expecting a
medal for that one.

42:59.258 --> 43:00.611
You remembered the charm.

43:00.635 --> 43:02.019
Oh, my God.

43:02.678 --> 43:04.730
- The charm.
- You forgot the charm?

43:04.764 --> 43:06.023
We both did.

43:06.057 --> 43:08.359
Oh, my God. No wonder
she was so pissed.

43:08.809 --> 43:10.444
Yeah, well, look at her now.

43:11.521 --> 43:13.499
Oh! It's the Glitter
Hair Barbie!

43:13.523 --> 43:16.283
Great! Thanks a lot!

43:16.317 --> 43:18.619
Oh, that's so cool!

43:18.736 --> 43:19.912
I don't know, Bay.

43:21.739 --> 43:23.926
Maybe the thing is to find the
people who actually want your help

43:23.950 --> 43:25.209
and just help them.

43:35.044 --> 43:37.231
Should we come back when you
guys have this figured out?

43:37.255 --> 43:38.732
No, no. We've got it.

43:38.756 --> 43:40.266
It'll focus by itself.

43:40.591 --> 43:42.726
Yeah. I think.

43:43.219 --> 43:44.770
Let's check the manual.

43:45.972 --> 43:48.075
You guys should see all
the cool stuff I got,

43:48.099 --> 43:52.162
like a Beatrix Potter lamp and
a Sonic the Hedgehog game.

43:52.186 --> 43:53.696
What else. Um...

43:53.813 --> 43:55.749
Ew. A makeup kit.

43:55.773 --> 43:56.875
A little lame.

43:56.899 --> 43:57.876
Yeah...

43:57.900 --> 43:59.076
And look.

44:00.611 --> 44:02.329
Bay remembered the charm.

44:05.783 --> 44:07.501
Uh, smile.
