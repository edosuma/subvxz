00:03.700 --> 00:08.247
Horsin' Around is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:08.330 --> 00:10.499
Mondays.

00:10.583 --> 00:13.377
Well, good morning to you too.

00:13.461 --> 00:14.711
Oh, hey.

00:14.795 --> 00:16.547
Where? I'd love hay.

00:19.758 --> 00:22.803
In 1987, the situation
comedy Horsin' Around

00:22.886 --> 00:24.263
premiered on ABC.

00:24.346 --> 00:26.474
The show, in which a young, bachelor horse

00:26.557 --> 00:28.684
is forced to reevaluate his priorities

00:28.767 --> 00:31.103
when he agrees to raise
three human children,

00:31.186 --> 00:32.980
was initially dismissed by critics

00:33.063 --> 00:36.567
as broad and saccharine and not good,

00:36.651 --> 00:39.278
but the family comedy
struck a chord with America

00:39.361 --> 00:41.530
and went on to air for nine seasons.

00:41.614 --> 00:44.575
The star of Horsin'
Around, BoJack Horseman,

00:44.659 --> 00:45.784
is our guest tonight.

00:45.867 --> 00:47.035
Welcome, BoJack.

00:47.119 --> 00:48.579
It is good to be here, Charlie.

00:48.663 --> 00:49.913
Sorry I was late. The traffic...

00:49.997 --> 00:51.290
It's really no problem.

00:51.373 --> 00:52.541
I parked in a handicapped spot.

00:52.625 --> 00:53.626
I hope that's okay.

00:53.709 --> 00:54.710
You parked in a...

00:54.793 --> 00:55.794
I'm sorry, disabled spot.

00:55.877 --> 00:58.380
Is that the proper nomenclature?

00:58.464 --> 01:00.007
Maybe you should move the car.

01:00.090 --> 01:01.425
No, I don't think I should drive right now.

01:01.509 --> 01:03.302
I'm incredibly drunk.

01:03.385 --> 01:06.180
You're telling me that
you're drunk right now?

01:06.263 --> 01:08.182
Is it just me, or am I
nailing this interview?

01:08.265 --> 01:09.558
I kind of feel like I'm nailing it.

01:09.642 --> 01:11.185
Yes.

01:11.268 --> 01:13.979
Anyway, we were talking
about Horsin' Around.

01:14.062 --> 01:16.273
To what do you attribute
the show's wide appeal?

01:16.357 --> 01:17.692
Charlie, listen, you know,

01:17.774 --> 01:18.942
I know that it's very hip these days

01:19.026 --> 01:20.611
to shit all over Horsin' Around,

01:20.695 --> 01:22.070
but at the time, I can tell you...

01:22.154 --> 01:23.322
- Is it okay to say "shit"?
- Please don't.

01:23.405 --> 01:24.615
'Cause I... I think the show's

01:24.699 --> 01:26.241
actually pretty solid for what it is.

01:26.325 --> 01:27.826
It's not Ibsen, sure,

01:27.909 --> 01:29.411
but look, for a lot of people,

01:29.495 --> 01:31.955
life is just one long,
hard kick in the urethra,

01:32.039 --> 01:33.957
and sometimes when you get home

01:34.041 --> 01:35.834
from a long day of getting
kicked in the urethra,

01:35.917 --> 01:38.795
you just want to watch a show
about good, likable people

01:38.920 --> 01:40.130
who love each other,

01:40.214 --> 01:41.757
where, you know, no matter what happens,

01:41.840 --> 01:43.509
at the end of 30 minutes,

01:43.592 --> 01:45.177
everything's gonna turn out okay.

01:45.260 --> 01:47.054
You know, because in real life...

01:47.137 --> 01:49.724
Did I already say the
thing about the urethra?

01:49.806 --> 01:51.433
Well, let's talk about real life.

01:51.517 --> 01:53.602
What have you been doing
since the show's cancellation

01:53.686 --> 01:54.978
18 years ago?

01:55.062 --> 01:56.355
That's a great question, Charlie.

01:56.438 --> 01:58.607
I, uh...

01:58.691 --> 02:00.150
Uh, I...

02:01.652 --> 02:03.945
Um...

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074

Maury! Maury! Maury! Maury!

03:03.213 --> 03:04.965
In the case of one-year-old Phoenix,

03:05.048 --> 03:07.426
you are the father.

03:07.509 --> 03:09.886
Morning, sunshine.

03:11.221 --> 03:12.723
Why so gloomy, roomie?

03:12.807 --> 03:13.808
First of all, we're not roommates.

03:13.890 --> 03:15.350
You are my houseguest.

03:15.434 --> 03:17.603
Well, we don't need to
put labels on things.

03:17.686 --> 03:19.480
You sleep on my couch,
and you don't pay rent.

03:19.563 --> 03:21.732
I've had tapeworms that
were less parasitic.

03:21.816 --> 03:22.817
I don't even remember why I let you

03:22.899 --> 03:24.109
stay with me in the first place.

03:24.192 --> 03:25.444
Because my parents kicked me out,

03:25.527 --> 03:27.154
and I had nowhere to go,

03:27.237 --> 03:28.614
and even though you don't
want anyone to know it...

03:33.994 --> 03:36.079
You secretly have a good heart.

03:36.163 --> 03:37.372
You told me they didn't approve

03:37.456 --> 03:39.166
of your "alternative lifestyle."

03:39.249 --> 03:40.459
I thought you were, like,

03:40.542 --> 03:41.960
a troubled gay teen or something.

03:42.043 --> 03:43.545
I didn't realize by "alternative lifestyle"

03:43.629 --> 03:44.880
that you meant you were lazy.

03:44.963 --> 03:47.048
That's on you for making assumptions.

03:47.132 --> 03:49.343
Also, if you're looking
for the Toaster Strudels,

03:49.426 --> 03:51.679
I got really high last
night and ate them all.

03:54.014 --> 03:56.350
Did you say you've had tapeworms?

04:00.813 --> 04:02.022
Thanks for meeting me here.

04:02.105 --> 04:03.732
I would have invited you to my office,

04:03.816 --> 04:05.818
but the electric company
shut off our power.

04:05.901 --> 04:06.902
That's unfortunate.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.445
Just an issue with the bank

04:08.529 --> 04:09.864
and a lack of money in it.

04:09.946 --> 04:12.157
Now, as you know, Penguin is very eager

04:12.240 --> 04:13.408
to publish your memoirs,

04:13.492 --> 04:15.536
but you keep missing your deadlines.

04:15.619 --> 04:16.786
I know, and I'm sorry,

04:16.870 --> 04:18.539
but I am making great progress.

04:18.622 --> 04:22.250
The BoJack Horseman Story,

04:22.334 --> 04:24.837
written by BoJack Horseman.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.380
Chapter one.

04:27.381 --> 04:29.383
Chapter one.

04:30.676 --> 04:34.429
Chapter...

04:35.972 --> 04:37.558
One.

04:37.641 --> 04:39.685
Look, we really need a
bestseller here at Penguin.

04:39.768 --> 04:42.437
Things are not that
great for me, money wise.

04:42.521 --> 04:44.606
Aren't you an editor at
a major publishing house?

04:44.690 --> 04:46.525
Yeah, a publishing house.

04:46.608 --> 04:48.151
When was the last time you saw a book?

04:48.235 --> 04:49.444
I thought I saw someone

04:49.528 --> 04:50.863
reading one in the park the other day,

04:50.946 --> 04:52.364
but it turned out it was a takeout menu.

04:52.447 --> 04:54.533
Whenever you're ready.

04:58.829 --> 05:00.372
We're living month to month here.

05:00.455 --> 05:02.123
We're kind of counting
on your autobiography

05:02.207 --> 05:03.542
to save the company, no pressure.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.168
That's actually a lot of pressure.

05:05.252 --> 05:07.128
Have you considered
working with a ghostwriter?

05:07.254 --> 05:08.756
Ugh, no, thank you.

05:08.839 --> 05:10.340
Look, just give me one more week,

05:10.424 --> 05:11.926
and I will give you some pages

05:12.008 --> 05:13.969
that'll knock your ass
back to the South Pole.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.429
I'm from Cincinnati.

05:15.512 --> 05:17.180
It... that doesn't matter.

05:17.264 --> 05:18.473
I'll call you in a week.

05:18.557 --> 05:19.558
Yes, one week.

05:19.641 --> 05:20.809
I'm telling you,

05:20.893 --> 05:23.771
this book is a top priority for me.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.235
Oh, right. Yeesh.

05:32.237 --> 05:33.864
You're wearing that to the prom?

05:33.948 --> 05:35.699
What, you don't think it's cute?

05:35.783 --> 05:38.452
Neigh way, Jose.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.915
"Neigh way, Jose."

05:42.998 --> 05:44.792
I improvised that line.

05:44.875 --> 05:46.126
I mean, it was written,

05:46.209 --> 05:48.044
but I gave it the old BoJack spin.

05:48.128 --> 05:50.505
Hey, how many times have
you watched this episode?

05:50.589 --> 05:51.882
Yeah, but do you get it, though?

05:51.966 --> 05:53.258
Because "nay" means no,

05:53.341 --> 05:54.885
but it's also a thing that horses say.

05:54.969 --> 05:56.804
It works on every level.

05:56.887 --> 05:58.973
- I get it.
- Ah, you don't get it.

06:22.913 --> 06:24.122
Are you drunk?

06:24.205 --> 06:25.749
Todd, I weigh over 1,200 pounds.

06:25.833 --> 06:28.460
It takes a lot of beer to get me drunk.

06:28.543 --> 06:29.544
Yes.

06:29.628 --> 06:31.171
Ah, yeah, I see.

06:31.254 --> 06:33.131
You're just bummed out
because Princess Carolyn

06:33.214 --> 06:34.466
dumped you last night.

06:36.593 --> 06:38.303
BoJack, we need to talk.

06:38.386 --> 06:39.763
Hey, check out the rug on that guy.

06:39.847 --> 06:41.139
Slow and steady, am I right, ladies?

06:42.307 --> 06:43.642
Ha-cha-cha.

06:43.725 --> 06:45.143
Who does he think he's fooling?

06:45.226 --> 06:46.603
Turtles don't have hair.

06:46.687 --> 06:47.855
Stop embarrassing me.

06:47.938 --> 06:49.439
That is Lenny Turteltaub.

06:49.523 --> 06:51.025
You know, I am not crazy
about the bread here.

06:51.107 --> 06:52.108
Mm.

06:52.192 --> 06:53.652
Why do I keep eating it?

06:53.735 --> 06:56.571
BoJack, can you please
just listen for a second?

06:56.655 --> 06:59.867
You have my undivided attention.

06:59.950 --> 07:02.327
I think we should see other people.

07:02.410 --> 07:04.454
Were we not seeing other people?

07:06.999 --> 07:08.834
BoJack, I'm almost there.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.293
Wait. Shh! Shut up.

07:10.377 --> 07:13.463
Now, that's a horse of a different...

07:13.547 --> 07:14.548
cruller?

07:14.631 --> 07:16.383
Oh!

07:16.466 --> 07:19.219
God, that's good comedy.

07:19.302 --> 07:20.888
- BoJack!
- What?

07:20.971 --> 07:22.138
Everyone gets a mulligan,

07:22.222 --> 07:25.183
and my mulligan was Carey Mulligan.

07:25.266 --> 07:28.103
I'm kidding, jeez. It was Emily Mortimer.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.938
What is the problem here?

07:30.022 --> 07:31.982
Are you embarrassed of
me because I'm a has-been?

07:32.066 --> 07:33.692
Because you know that I'm writing that book

07:33.775 --> 07:35.694
that is gonna make everybody love me again.

07:35.777 --> 07:37.654
You're not really writing a book.

07:37.738 --> 07:38.906
Well, I already spent my advance,

07:38.989 --> 07:40.240
so that's a first step.

07:40.323 --> 07:41.909
Look, this has been a lot of fun,

07:41.992 --> 07:43.660
but I need to start
thinking about my future.

07:43.744 --> 07:45.662
I mean, you don't even respect me enough

07:45.746 --> 07:46.747
to have a baby with me.

07:46.830 --> 07:47.831
Whoa, what?

07:47.915 --> 07:49.374
I never explicitly said that.

07:49.457 --> 07:51.001
You said it with your actions.

07:51.085 --> 07:52.127
What actions?

07:53.461 --> 07:55.213
Oh, look at that baby.

07:55.296 --> 07:57.424
Isn't he the cutest baby you ever saw?

07:57.507 --> 07:58.926
What? What? What? No, no, wha...

08:10.395 --> 08:12.188
Step away from
the stolen vehicle, sir!

08:12.272 --> 08:14.024
No, no, no.
Misunderstanding, officer.

08:14.108 --> 08:15.692
I was running away from my girlfriend

08:15.776 --> 08:18.028
whom I don't respect
enough to have a baby with.

08:18.112 --> 08:20.447
Hey, aren't you the
horse from Horsin' Around?

08:20.530 --> 08:23.075
Oh, face it. You're afraid of commitment.

08:23.158 --> 08:24.701
I'm not afraid of commitment.

08:24.785 --> 08:26.327
I commit to things all the time.

08:26.411 --> 08:28.038
It's the following
through on that commitment

08:28.122 --> 08:29.205
that I take issue with.

08:29.289 --> 08:31.041
Hey, stupid, isn't that
your friend over there?

08:31.125 --> 08:32.626
Oh, Mr. Peanutbutter?

08:32.708 --> 08:34.001
God, I hope he doesn't see us.

08:34.086 --> 08:36.254
Is that BoJack Horseman?

08:36.337 --> 08:37.714
Oh, jeez, here we go.

08:37.798 --> 08:39.091
Mr. Peanutbutter

08:39.174 --> 08:41.969
and BoJack Horseman in the same room.

08:42.052 --> 08:44.304
What is this, a crossover episode?

08:44.387 --> 08:46.140
You know, that gets funnier every time.

08:46.222 --> 08:47.724
You're being sarcastic,

08:47.808 --> 08:49.601
but I think it does actually
get funnier every time.

08:49.684 --> 08:51.019
We're actually in the middle
of breaking up right now,

08:51.103 --> 08:52.813
- so if you could just...
- Yeah?

08:52.896 --> 08:54.397
- You're in the middle of it?
- Yeah, that's right.

08:54.481 --> 08:57.442
So would it be awkward
if I joined you right now?

08:57.525 --> 08:58.986
Yes, actually, it's very awkward.

08:59.069 --> 09:00.236
Is that not clear?

09:00.320 --> 09:02.781
Yeah, this is awkward right now?

09:02.864 --> 09:04.032
Yes, please leave.

09:04.116 --> 09:05.617
How are you, Mr. Peanutbutter?

09:05.700 --> 09:08.078
Oh, living the dream,
P.C., living the dream.

09:08.162 --> 09:09.579
Why are you making conversation?

09:09.663 --> 09:11.081
Oh, let's see, it's the English word...

09:11.165 --> 09:13.000
It's called being polite, BoJack.

09:13.083 --> 09:15.085
But am I crazy that this is a bad time?

09:15.169 --> 09:17.420
Always a Clydesdale,
never a Clyde, eh, BoJack?

09:17.545 --> 09:18.797
What?

09:18.880 --> 09:20.423
You'll get that one later, man.

09:20.507 --> 09:22.258
Erica, get out of here with that face.

09:22.342 --> 09:23.510
Would it kill you to be civil?

09:23.593 --> 09:25.220
This is why we're breaking up.

09:25.303 --> 09:27.263
So it's not because of
the thing with the baby?

09:27.347 --> 09:29.099
It's because of a lot of things!

09:29.183 --> 09:30.642
Waiter, could we please have the check?

09:30.725 --> 09:32.227
- Thank you.
- We haven't even ordered yet.

09:32.310 --> 09:35.063
I have wasted so many dinners
on you, BoJack Horseman.

09:35.147 --> 09:37.607
I don't know how you can
expect anyone else to love you

09:37.691 --> 09:39.359
when you so clearly hate yourself.

09:39.442 --> 09:42.070
- Here you go.
- Let me see that.

09:42.154 --> 09:45.240
$10 for bread?

09:45.323 --> 09:46.950
I don't want to live in a society

09:47.034 --> 09:48.660
where the premeal bread isn't free.

09:48.743 --> 09:51.538
It is free if you order a meal.

09:51.621 --> 09:53.165
Can you take me home, please?

09:53.248 --> 09:54.708
Yeah, but I didn't even
eat that much bread.

09:54.791 --> 09:55.792
What did I have? I must have had...

09:55.876 --> 09:58.003
You ate nine baskets, sir.

09:58.086 --> 09:59.462
Nine... really?

09:59.587 --> 10:01.631
Great, now I'm gonna feel
like a fat ass all week.

10:03.508 --> 10:05.468
You've seen me naked. Do
you think I'm getting chubby?

10:05.552 --> 10:07.095
You want to know the real
reason we're breaking up?

10:07.179 --> 10:08.263
What was that? Sorry.

10:08.346 --> 10:10.598
Couldn't hear you over the sound
of my calories not metabolizing.

10:10.682 --> 10:12.684
This is so classic you.

10:12.767 --> 10:14.102
You're using this bread thing

10:14.186 --> 10:16.021
to avoid talking about our relationship.

10:16.104 --> 10:17.981
No, that is definitely not happening.

10:18.065 --> 10:19.774
I'd like to go home now.

10:22.194 --> 10:23.403
You think I'm fat.

10:23.486 --> 10:25.321
So yeah, technically I was dumped,

10:25.405 --> 10:27.157
but the real headline of the evening was,

10:27.241 --> 10:29.659
"Dumb guy eats bread, gets fat, the end."

10:29.743 --> 10:32.079
What kind of headline is that?

10:32.162 --> 10:34.289
Wasn't there a pizza here a second ago?

10:34.372 --> 10:36.583
God damn it! Stop the presses.

10:36.666 --> 10:38.418
You're not fat.

10:38.501 --> 10:41.088
Oh, hey, let's throw a
party. That'll cheer you up.

10:41.213 --> 10:43.673
No, it won't. It'll cheer you up.

10:43.757 --> 10:45.133
I'll stand in the corner by myself

10:45.217 --> 10:46.801
eating cotton candy until I barf

10:46.885 --> 10:48.803
like I did at your last party.

10:48.887 --> 10:52.432
Hey, aren't you the
horse from Horsin' Around?

10:54.935 --> 10:56.978
That was a good party.

10:57.062 --> 10:59.814
Hey, didn't we get a cotton
candy machine for that party?

10:59.898 --> 11:02.317
Who told you Princess
Carolyn and I broke up?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.069
- She did.
- What?

11:04.152 --> 11:05.695
You never took me home, jerk!

11:05.779 --> 11:07.530
Oh, everything's my fault.

11:07.614 --> 11:09.199
Take me home.

11:09.283 --> 11:11.243
Okay, jeez.

11:11.326 --> 11:13.078
But I'm not looking for
parking in Silver Lake.

11:13.161 --> 11:14.370
I'll slow the car down to a crawl,

11:14.454 --> 11:15.455
and you can duck and roll.

11:17.415 --> 11:19.709
You know what, you can take
a last look at this face,

11:19.793 --> 11:21.295
because it's the last
time you're gonna see it.

11:21.377 --> 11:22.378
Hey-up!

11:27.801 --> 11:29.052
Hello?

11:29.136 --> 11:30.470
I've got Princess Carolyn for you.

11:30.553 --> 11:31.972
Uh, okay.

11:32.055 --> 11:33.223
BoJack.

11:33.307 --> 11:34.808
Oh, my God, we just broke up.

11:34.891 --> 11:36.476
Yeah, but I'm still your agent.

11:36.559 --> 11:38.103
I pride myself on my ability

11:38.186 --> 11:40.688
to separate my professional
life from my personal life.

11:40.772 --> 11:41.815
Great.

11:41.982 --> 11:44.025
Then, as my agent, do
you think I'm getting fat?

11:44.109 --> 11:45.193
No way.

11:45.277 --> 11:47.445
You are in the prime of your
life, never looked better.

11:47.528 --> 11:48.696
What about as my ex-girlfriend?

11:48.780 --> 11:50.657
You look like a pile of crap
ate a second pile of crap

11:50.740 --> 11:52.242
and then crapped out a third pile of crap.

11:52.326 --> 11:54.828
Wait, wait, so which pile
of crap do I look like?

11:54.911 --> 11:56.746
- The third one.
- What? That's the worst one.

11:56.830 --> 11:58.414
I'm not calling you as your ex.

11:58.498 --> 12:00.334
I'm calling you as your agent.

12:00.416 --> 12:02.210
Remember that book you're
pretending to write?

12:02.294 --> 12:04.462
Well, Penguin wants an
update on your progress.

12:04.545 --> 12:05.880
Does Tuesday work for you,

12:05.964 --> 12:07.299
or are you gonna be too busy this week

12:07.382 --> 12:09.050
masturbating to old pictures of yourself?

12:09.134 --> 12:10.969
I told you, that's not what
was happening that time.

12:11.052 --> 12:13.554
I was masturbating to what
the picture represented.

12:13.638 --> 12:15.849
You walked in at the worst possible moment!

12:15.932 --> 12:17.517
So, Tuesday, though?

12:17.600 --> 12:18.643
Yes, fine!

12:20.603 --> 12:22.105
Whoo!

12:22.189 --> 12:23.690
You don't have anything?

12:23.773 --> 12:24.774
Hey, you got the electricity back.

12:24.858 --> 12:26.067
Good for you.

12:26.151 --> 12:27.277
This company is in dire straits.

12:29.029 --> 12:30.613
We made a series of very bad investments.

12:30.697 --> 12:32.157
Ever hear of a young adult franchise

12:32.240 --> 12:33.908
called the Swamp Monsters of Malibu?

12:33.992 --> 12:35.451
Uh, no.

12:35.535 --> 12:41.333
Then why did we spend
$20 million on marketing?

12:41.416 --> 12:44.127
It's okay, Pinky, go to your happy place.

12:44.211 --> 12:45.379
Uh...

12:45.461 --> 12:46.462
Look, I know you're a busy guy.

12:46.546 --> 12:47.547
Actually, I am a busy guy.

12:47.630 --> 12:49.007
I live a very active lifestyle.

12:50.758 --> 12:53.220
Can't I just stay home with you?

12:53.303 --> 12:55.680
I know kindergarten is scary,

12:55.763 --> 12:57.682
but you're a big girl now,

12:57.765 --> 12:59.976
and you have to be brave.

13:00.060 --> 13:01.477
Okay, Daddy.

13:01.561 --> 13:06.149
Wait, did you just call me "Daddy"?

13:06.233 --> 13:08.943
Little Sabrina grew up right
before our eyes, right, Todd?

13:09.027 --> 13:10.486
Todd?

13:10.570 --> 13:11.571
Todd!

13:11.654 --> 13:12.864
What?

13:12.947 --> 13:14.782
Did Sabrina grow up before our eyes?

13:14.866 --> 13:16.034
Yes!

13:17.577 --> 13:18.578
We're tired of waiting.

13:18.661 --> 13:20.747
We're hiring you a ghostwriter.

13:20.830 --> 13:22.874
Diane "Nugent"?

13:22.957 --> 13:25.126
She's great, and she's
got a thing for horses.

13:25.210 --> 13:27.170
Check this out.

13:27.254 --> 13:28.880
Hey, Secretariat.

13:28.963 --> 13:30.506
You know, I always wanted to
play Secretariat in a movie.

13:30.590 --> 13:32.133
He's kind of my personal hero.

13:32.217 --> 13:34.719
Could never get the project
off the ground, though.

13:34.802 --> 13:36.763
I mean, there was this one
time I came close in the '90s,

13:36.846 --> 13:38.514
but then those Prefontaine movies came out,

13:38.598 --> 13:40.475
and people got tired of
seeing running on-screen.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.643
Don't tell me. Tell her!

13:42.727 --> 13:44.145
She's cute.

13:44.229 --> 13:46.398
Call her. That's a loan, by the way.

13:46.481 --> 13:48.649
We can't afford to be giving
out free books to people,

13:48.733 --> 13:50.277
but you can take anything you want

13:50.360 --> 13:52.612
from the Swamp Monsters swag box.

13:58.410 --> 14:00.120
Oh, God, I'm a failure.

14:00.203 --> 14:02.122
Oh, you're not a failure.

14:02.205 --> 14:03.623
Why did I say I could write a book?

14:03.706 --> 14:05.792
Because you have an amazing story to tell.

14:05.875 --> 14:07.710
- Relax.
- Relax?

14:07.794 --> 14:09.212
Easy for you to say, you hippie.

14:09.296 --> 14:11.923
You've never had a day
of stress in your life.

14:12.006 --> 14:13.674
Ow. Why?

14:13.758 --> 14:17.512
And that's for trying to
sell E on the cartel's turf.

14:18.846 --> 14:20.432
Oh, where's Gabriela?

14:20.515 --> 14:23.184
She went back to Mexico City, ese,

14:23.268 --> 14:25.395
to be with her husband.

14:25.479 --> 14:28.648
What? No!

14:30.275 --> 14:32.068
- Gabriela, why?
- Who?

14:32.152 --> 14:33.487
We were talking about me.

14:33.569 --> 14:35.280
Can you try to focus for, like, a second?

14:35.363 --> 14:37.115
Oh, yeah, sorry. You were saying?

14:37.198 --> 14:38.866
Never should have signed this book deal.

14:38.950 --> 14:39.951
You know what my problem is?

14:40.034 --> 14:41.202
I can't say no to people

14:41.286 --> 14:42.703
because I want everyone to like me.

14:42.787 --> 14:46.249
You want everyone to like you?

14:46.333 --> 14:47.625
Yeah, why?

14:47.708 --> 14:49.002
Do people not like me?

14:49.085 --> 14:53.465
Uh...

14:55.300 --> 14:58.136
Uh...

14:58.219 --> 14:59.387
What were we talking about?

14:59.471 --> 15:01.181
I can see the headline now,

15:01.264 --> 15:04.892
"Stupid BoJack writes a stupid
book about his stupid life,

15:04.976 --> 15:06.102
nobody cares."

15:06.186 --> 15:07.979
What newspapers are you reading?

15:08.062 --> 15:09.647
Hey, why don't you just let that lady

15:09.730 --> 15:11.191
write your book and be done with it?

15:11.274 --> 15:12.900
Better question, why are you in my kitchen?

15:12.984 --> 15:13.985
I'm making breakfast.

15:14.068 --> 15:15.778
We had sex last night, dummy.

15:15.862 --> 15:17.447
Ugh, I really got to start putting my phone

15:17.531 --> 15:19.115
on airplane mode when I drink.

15:21.034 --> 15:23.077
This lady probably thinks I'm
just some dumb sitcom actor.

15:23.161 --> 15:24.620
I hate her and her stupid,

15:24.704 --> 15:26.331
impossible-to-pronounce
last name,

15:26.414 --> 15:27.874
Na-goo-ya-go-goo-goo-goo-ga.

15:27.957 --> 15:29.376
You haven't even met her.

15:29.459 --> 15:30.835
Give her a chance.

15:30.918 --> 15:32.587
Oh, you should invite her to the party.

15:32.670 --> 15:33.713
What party?

15:33.796 --> 15:35.006
Why are you so obsessed

15:35.089 --> 15:37.551
with throwing a party all of a sudden?

15:37.633 --> 15:39.260
Ow, ow, ow!

15:39.344 --> 15:41.221
You know how much money
we lost 'cause of you?

15:41.304 --> 15:44.849
I can't even afford a hall now
for my daughter's 15th birthday,

15:44.932 --> 15:48.520
and now I got a hundred guests
coming and nowhere to put them.

15:48.603 --> 15:52.648
You owe me a party, cabrón,
and if you don't deliver...

15:56.152 --> 15:57.737
Because parties are fun?

15:57.820 --> 15:59.447
This book is really important to me.

15:59.531 --> 16:00.948
I don't want to just hand
it off to some stranger.

16:01.032 --> 16:02.825
If it's so important, why have you written

16:02.909 --> 16:04.369
literally nothing in a year and a half?

16:04.452 --> 16:05.828
It's too much pressure.

16:05.912 --> 16:08.789
This book is my one shot
at preserving my legacy.

16:08.873 --> 16:10.917
I'm a joke, and if this book isn't good,

16:11.000 --> 16:12.627
I'm gonna be a joke forever.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.379
Everyone thinks that I'm
just this washed-up hack,

16:14.462 --> 16:16.130
but actually...

16:16.214 --> 16:18.716
Oh, God, actually, what if they're right?

16:18.799 --> 16:20.635
I can't breathe.

16:20.718 --> 16:21.802
Am I dying?

16:21.886 --> 16:24.055
Toast. I smell burning toast!

16:24.138 --> 16:26.724
Oh, my God, my toast!

16:26.807 --> 16:28.768
Todd, on my grave,

16:28.851 --> 16:34.232
I want it to say that I was born in 1975.

16:34.315 --> 16:35.609
No one's gonna believe...

16:35.691 --> 16:37.569
Damn it, can't you
respect a dying man's wish?

16:37.652 --> 16:39.153
You're not dying.

16:44.992 --> 16:47.621
Well, we did everything we could.

16:47.703 --> 16:49.539
Nurse, record the time of death.

16:49.623 --> 16:51.541
It doesn't get easier.

16:51.625 --> 16:53.126
It never gets easier.

16:57.046 --> 16:58.465
What... I don't...

16:58.548 --> 17:01.717
What do you mean he's dead?

17:01.801 --> 17:03.428
That's right, sweetheart.

17:03.511 --> 17:05.305
He died of a broken heart

17:05.387 --> 17:07.390
because you didn't appreciate him enough,

17:07.473 --> 17:09.349
and now he's gone forever.

17:09.434 --> 17:11.603
We might have gone too
dark on that series finale.

17:11.685 --> 17:12.853
I'm required to hand you over

17:12.936 --> 17:14.771
to the child protective services.

17:14.855 --> 17:16.022
You're the state's problem now.

17:16.107 --> 17:18.609
No!

17:18.693 --> 17:21.194
Do you just take those DVDs
with you everywhere you go?

17:21.279 --> 17:22.656
Linus walked around with a blanket.

17:22.738 --> 17:24.073
No one gave him shit for it.

17:24.156 --> 17:25.492
How long is that doctor going to take?

17:25.575 --> 17:27.117
I have a meeting with
another client at 3:00.

17:27.201 --> 17:28.494
You have other clients?

17:28.578 --> 17:30.746
No, I make a living off you
sitting on your ass all day.

17:30.830 --> 17:33.749
Are your other clients
more talented than I am?

17:33.833 --> 17:35.168
Your silence speaks volumes.

17:37.170 --> 17:40.173
Well, BoJack, it looks
like what you experienced

17:40.256 --> 17:42.216
was a mild anxiety attack.

17:42.300 --> 17:43.759
Jesus, if that's mild,

17:43.843 --> 17:46.179
I don't want to know what spicy feels like.

17:46.262 --> 17:47.472
Too smart for the room?

17:47.555 --> 17:48.806
It was a salsa joke, people.

17:48.889 --> 17:50.308
You've been overstressed.

17:50.391 --> 17:52.310
I need you to take it easy.

17:52.393 --> 17:54.145
Take it easy, are you kidding?

17:54.228 --> 17:56.564
He doesn't have a job. He
has no real responsibilities.

17:56.648 --> 17:58.525
He doesn't do anything but take it easy.

17:58.608 --> 18:01.569
Well, can you take it even easier?

18:01.653 --> 18:04.238
I can try, doctor. I can try.

18:04.322 --> 18:06.491
This book deal is
obviously stressing you out.

18:06.574 --> 18:08.576
Will you just call the ghostwriter already?

18:08.660 --> 18:12.830
What, you want me to call
this woman on the phone?

18:14.374 --> 18:17.043
Well, you just had another anxiety attack.

18:17.126 --> 18:19.128
And Entertainment Weekly
said I wasn't consistent.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.340
Really, not even a pity laugh?

18:22.423 --> 18:24.008
I did almost die.

18:24.091 --> 18:25.426
Ha.

18:25.510 --> 18:27.845
I have to check on some other patients.

18:27.928 --> 18:29.263
You have other patients?

18:29.347 --> 18:31.474
BoJack, let's have a party, okay?

18:31.558 --> 18:32.684
I'll organize the whole thing.

18:32.767 --> 18:33.934
You can invite the ghostwriter

18:34.018 --> 18:35.770
and have a nice, casual conversation

18:35.853 --> 18:38.732
in a fun, pressure-free environment.

18:38.814 --> 18:40.734
Okay, fine. We'll have a party.

18:40.816 --> 18:42.235
Oh, thank God.

18:42.318 --> 18:43.778
But we're not getting
a cotton candy machine.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.363
I can't control myself around those things.

18:45.446 --> 18:46.947
I totally hear what you are saying,

18:47.031 --> 18:49.116
and I will do my best.

19:02.505 --> 19:06.384
Señor Horseman, I will never
forget your generosity today.

19:06.467 --> 19:09.845
You have made a powerful ally for life.

19:09.929 --> 19:11.723
Mwah. Let's dance!

19:11.806 --> 19:13.182
Todd, who was that guy?

19:13.266 --> 19:14.434
Who are all these people?

19:14.517 --> 19:16.060
Oh, you know, just a variety of folks

19:16.143 --> 19:17.144
from all walks of life.

19:17.228 --> 19:18.646
Is this a quinceañera?

19:18.730 --> 19:20.565
Oh, so any party with Mexican teenage girls

19:20.648 --> 19:21.649
is a quinceañera?

19:21.733 --> 19:23.192
Now who's racist?

19:27.280 --> 19:29.323
I find that piñata offensive.

19:29.407 --> 19:30.908
If you'll excuse me,

19:30.991 --> 19:34.537
I have a Virgin of
Guadalupe pendant to present.

19:38.416 --> 19:40.585
BoJack!

19:40.668 --> 19:41.961
Oh, good Lord.

19:42.044 --> 19:44.297
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

19:44.380 --> 19:46.966
Can you believe this, the
two of us in the same house?

19:47.049 --> 19:48.968
Is this a crossover episode?

19:49.051 --> 19:51.345
No, I'm just kidding around, man.

19:51.429 --> 19:53.640
Seriously, though, how are you?

19:53.723 --> 19:54.766
Well, I've been kind of up and...

19:54.849 --> 19:56.601
Living the dream, huh? Yeah.

19:56.684 --> 19:58.519
Hey, we'll catch up later, all right?

19:58.603 --> 20:00.647
I want to talk to you.

20:00.730 --> 20:03.107
Erica, how are you looking so beautiful?

20:03.190 --> 20:04.275
I'm furious.

20:10.531 --> 20:12.784
Hey, BoJack, right?

20:12.867 --> 20:15.202
- BoJack Horseman?
- Yes.

20:15.286 --> 20:17.622
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, I don't
want to mispronounce your name.

20:17.705 --> 20:19.248
It's Diane.

20:19.332 --> 20:20.834
Oh, Diane.

20:20.916 --> 20:22.627
Thanks for inviting me to your party.

20:22.710 --> 20:23.919
Sorry I haven't really been mingling.

20:24.003 --> 20:26.172
I get kind of awkward at parties.

20:26.255 --> 20:28.090
- Have you tried alcohol?
- I don't know.

20:28.174 --> 20:32.011
Parties make me anxious
in a real broad sense.

20:32.094 --> 20:33.721
Like, look at that guy.

20:33.805 --> 20:35.014
He's having fun.

20:35.097 --> 20:36.265
Why haven't I figured it out?

20:36.349 --> 20:37.350
What guy?

20:37.433 --> 20:38.726
No, there's no guy there.

20:38.810 --> 20:41.020
I'm just saying, like, a guy, you know?

20:41.103 --> 20:42.438
Oh, okay, yeah.

20:42.522 --> 20:44.357
I'm probably just overthinking it

20:44.440 --> 20:46.275
because I never got the practice

20:46.359 --> 20:48.152
because I didn't get invited
to any parties in high school.

20:48.235 --> 20:50.029
What am I talking about?

20:50.112 --> 20:51.739
You don't care about any of that.

20:51.823 --> 20:53.199
Shut up, Diane.

20:53.282 --> 20:55.242
You're at a party, compliment the host.

20:55.326 --> 20:57.745
You have a lovely home.

20:57.829 --> 20:59.789
Yeah, well, if you're gonna throw away

20:59.873 --> 21:01.833
most of your adult life
on some dumb sitcom,

21:01.916 --> 21:04.919
you might as well get a sweet
house out of the deal, right?

21:05.002 --> 21:07.296
So what are you working on these days?

21:07.380 --> 21:08.715
Well, mostly I just sit around the house

21:08.798 --> 21:09.924
and complain about things.

21:10.007 --> 21:12.009
Yeah, how's that working out for you?

21:12.092 --> 21:13.928
I can't complain, so you know.

21:14.011 --> 21:16.305
No, I will not have sex with you!

21:16.389 --> 21:18.641
This girl wants me to have sex with her.

21:18.725 --> 21:20.476
No, I'm just kidding around.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.061
You're a good sport.

21:22.144 --> 21:24.313
- Ugh, you know who that is?
- Mr. Peanutbutter?

21:24.397 --> 21:26.649
Yeah, he was on that show
Mr. Peanutbutter's House

21:26.733 --> 21:29.360
about that dog who adopted
the three human kids.

21:29.443 --> 21:32.279
What a dumb idea for a TV show.

21:32.363 --> 21:34.699
You people are all right.

21:34.782 --> 21:36.158
Who wants an autograph?

21:36.242 --> 21:37.660
He's so stupid he doesn't realize

21:37.744 --> 21:40.162
how miserable he should be. I envy that.

21:40.246 --> 21:42.623
Hey, do you know the story of
the dad from The Brady Bunch?

21:42.707 --> 21:43.999
Do I know his story?

21:44.083 --> 21:45.334
If I recall correctly,

21:45.418 --> 21:46.419
he was bringing up three boys of his own.

21:46.502 --> 21:47.628
Right, but...

21:47.712 --> 21:48.755
They were four men living all together,

21:48.838 --> 21:49.839
but they were all alone.

21:49.964 --> 21:51.799
That is profoundly sad.

21:51.883 --> 21:54.928
No, the story is that
the guy who played the dad

21:55.010 --> 21:58.222
hated being on The Brady Bunch
because he was a real actor,

21:58.305 --> 21:59.974
and he considered it beneath him.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.392
Sound familiar?

22:01.475 --> 22:03.269
That's not all that was beneath him.

22:03.352 --> 22:05.563
Gay joke. Sorry, I'm better than that.

22:05.646 --> 22:07.398
Most people don't even get to do

22:07.481 --> 22:08.942
The Brady Bunch version

22:09.024 --> 22:10.568
of the thing they want
to do with their lives.

22:10.651 --> 22:12.862
You're actually in a
really good position now,

22:12.946 --> 22:14.822
because you can pretty
much do anything you want.

22:14.906 --> 22:16.616
You're responsible for your
own happiness, you know?

22:16.699 --> 22:18.826
- Good Lord, that's depressing.
- No, it's not.

22:18.910 --> 22:20.536
I'm responsible for my own happiness?

22:20.620 --> 22:22.705
I can't even be responsible
for my own breakfast.

22:31.130 --> 22:32.548
Todd!

22:32.632 --> 22:33.800
I need help.

22:33.883 --> 22:36.469
What would make you happy?

22:36.552 --> 22:38.304
Well, finishing my memoir, I guess.

22:38.387 --> 22:40.347
Is that all? I can help you with that.

22:40.431 --> 22:42.600
Yeah? I mean, would you even want to?

22:42.683 --> 22:44.184
You'd have to spend a lot of time with me.

22:44.268 --> 22:45.603
You'd probably get sick of me.

22:45.686 --> 22:47.146
I don't think that's going to happen.

22:47.229 --> 22:49.148
- No?
- No, BoJack.

22:49.231 --> 22:50.775
Okay.

22:50.858 --> 22:52.610
Well, then I guess you're hired,

22:52.693 --> 22:54.946
but don't put all that stuff
about how sad I am in the book.

22:55.029 --> 22:56.238
Oh, that doesn't count.

22:56.322 --> 22:57.406
We weren't on the clock yet.

22:57.490 --> 22:58.866
Yeah, exactly.

22:58.950 --> 23:04.330
You're only my ghostwriter starting nah...

23:04.413 --> 23:05.999
- Starting now.
- You got it.

23:06.081 --> 23:08.001
- BoJack!
- Ugh, this guy.

23:08.083 --> 23:09.877
Hey, man, wanted to let you know,

23:09.961 --> 23:11.462
you are out of beer.

23:11.545 --> 23:12.797
Oh, I see you've met

23:12.880 --> 23:14.423
my beautiful girlfriend, Diane Nguyen.

23:14.507 --> 23:15.925
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.

23:16.009 --> 23:17.176
You drank all my beer?

23:17.259 --> 23:19.219
- Also, you two are dating?
- Yeah.

23:19.303 --> 23:21.014
- You're dating him?
- Yes.

23:21.096 --> 23:22.181
This is your boyfriend?

23:22.264 --> 23:23.599
- That is correct.
- Uh-huh.

23:23.683 --> 23:25.559
- You are going out with you?
- Uh-huh.

23:25.643 --> 23:27.269
But in a sexual way, not just as friends?

23:27.353 --> 23:28.688
- That's right.
- You have seen her naked.

23:28.771 --> 23:29.981
Many times, yes.

23:30.064 --> 23:31.440
- You are attracted to this?
- Yes.

23:31.524 --> 23:33.233
This penis has been inside this vagina.

23:33.317 --> 23:34.360
- Yep.
- But in a sexual way.

23:34.443 --> 23:36.737
Oh, yes.

23:36.821 --> 23:37.947
Humph.

23:40.574 --> 23:41.993
- Ugh.
- Oh, my God.

23:44.620 --> 23:45.788
Are you okay?

23:45.872 --> 23:46.873
I'm just...

23:46.956 --> 23:49.750
I'm fine.

23:49.834 --> 23:51.460
I'm just... I'm really happy for you.

23:52.628 --> 23:54.338
Should we get someone, or...

23:54.421 --> 23:55.965
No, everything's...

23:56.049 --> 23:57.884
Oh, this is really...

23:57.967 --> 23:59.426
Wonderful.

23:59.510 --> 24:00.594
Oh, God.

24:03.514 --> 24:05.766
