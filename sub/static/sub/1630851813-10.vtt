09:53.114 --> 09:55.377
What's your point?My point is,

09:55.420 --> 09:56.813
my division captain
is Larry James,

09:56.857 --> 09:57.945
who you need to call

09:57.988 --> 10:01.078
right now
before this gets any worse.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.518
[exhales]

10:08.564 --> 10:10.435
Uh, this is, uh, Ranger Perez.

10:10.479 --> 10:12.002
Ranger Perez.Currently on a leave of absence

10:12.046 --> 10:13.482
from
the Dallas Rangers Division.

10:13.525 --> 10:14.875
I'm calling for Captain James,
please.

10:14.918 --> 10:16.093
JAMES:
You got him.

10:16.137 --> 10:18.487
I am calling
in regards to a Ranger

10:18.530 --> 10:21.272
under your command,
a Cordell Walker.

10:21.316 --> 10:23.187
Yes. May I ask what case
he is currently assigned?

10:23.231 --> 10:25.189
JAMES:
He's working a 37.11. Why?

10:25.233 --> 10:27.583
And is he the type
who would

10:27.627 --> 10:30.455
blindly pull a car's e-brake

10:30.499 --> 10:32.501
from inside the trunk,
knowing

10:32.544 --> 10:35.330
it would send it
into an uncontrolled skid?

10:35.373 --> 10:37.071
JAMES: Yep. That sounds
like Ranger Walker.

10:37.114 --> 10:40.465
You don't say.
I appreciate your time, sir.

10:40.509 --> 10:42.467
"Appreciate your time."

10:48.691 --> 10:52.608
Well, I think I made
a little mistake, Ranger Walker.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.655
Agreed, Ranger Perez.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.569
Call me Cassie.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.186
Hey, uh, excuse me.

11:05.229 --> 11:07.057
Can I get the assessment records

11:07.101 --> 11:09.146
for 2105 Broken Trace Road?CLERK:
Yeah.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.408
That your property?

11:10.452 --> 11:11.627
Uh, no.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.715
Uh, not exactly.

11:14.978 --> 11:17.154
Contractor, huh? I can
always spot a contractor.

11:17.198 --> 11:18.547
Y'all always got

11:18.590 --> 11:20.680
those big biceps.[laughs]

11:21.768 --> 11:24.205
What's the address again, sugar?Uh,

11:24.248 --> 11:25.467
yeah. Right here.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.512
Appreciate that.

11:29.384 --> 11:31.081
It feels
like I've turned a new leaf.

11:31.125 --> 11:34.519
You know, my whole outlook is...
It's more positive.

11:34.563 --> 11:37.479
Which, you know, it wasn't...

11:37.522 --> 11:39.220
Oh. Hey, Gale.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.048
I'm so sorry,
we're not open yet.

11:41.091 --> 11:43.093
Oh, don't mind me.
Just, uh, chili spices.

11:43.137 --> 11:45.574
Yeah. Okay.I'll meet you
in the kitchen in a sec.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.141
I mean,

11:47.184 --> 11:49.012
I still...
I still think about Hoyt.

11:49.056 --> 11:51.014
Of course I do.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.407
You know, I think
about how he died.

11:52.450 --> 11:55.279
But I'm not responsible.
And I'm not gonna let

11:55.323 --> 11:57.020
my past define my future.

11:57.064 --> 12:00.154
I can't anymore.
It's time to move on.

12:00.197 --> 12:02.199
I'm gonna take
a little break.

12:06.551 --> 12:09.293
You know, if you shared your
secret family recipe with me,

12:09.337 --> 12:11.382
you wouldn't have to shop
for chili spices every week.

12:11.426 --> 12:12.601
Well, wouldn't be much

12:12.644 --> 12:14.168
of a secret family recipe then,
would it?

12:14.211 --> 12:16.518
[chuckles]Uh, my system is down.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.172
Is it okay if I pay cash?

12:18.215 --> 12:21.001
My husband
always used to pay cash.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.698
You know, I couldn't help

12:22.742 --> 12:24.395
but, uh, overhear
what you said in there.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.006
I'm sorry.

12:26.049 --> 12:28.660
Oh. Don't apologize.

12:28.704 --> 12:31.707
No, I just... I'm sorry
for what you've been through.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.013
I know a thing or two

12:33.056 --> 12:34.188
about loss.

12:35.189 --> 12:37.539
I heard about your husband.

12:37.582 --> 12:40.411
Yeah, well, I lost a hell
of a lot more than just Marv.

12:40.455 --> 12:44.241
Sounds like you found
more peace in a year

12:44.285 --> 12:46.504
than I have in 20.

12:46.548 --> 12:50.770
Well, you're more than welcome
to join us if you ever want.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.424
Maybe another time.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.037
Thank you.Thank you.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.255
Oh.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.781
I, uh...

13:01.824 --> 13:04.609
I took a hard look at my past.

13:06.176 --> 13:08.439
That's how I found peace.

13:09.484 --> 13:11.486
That's good advice.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.403
WALKER:
You know,

13:15.446 --> 13:17.318
you could've saved us both
some trouble

13:17.361 --> 13:19.581
if you led with,
"Hi there. I'm Ranger Perez.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.584
And you are?"Well, technically,
I'm on a leave of absence.

13:22.627 --> 13:23.846
A leave of absence, yeah?
Well, you're using

13:23.890 --> 13:26.153
your time off really well.
Tasing a Ranger

13:26.196 --> 13:27.589
and shoving him into a trunk?Oh!

13:27.632 --> 13:28.808
Please, I nudged you.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.244
You... [groans]And I tased you because

13:30.287 --> 13:32.072
you're dressed like our perp.I'm not dressed

13:32.115 --> 13:34.465
like our perp.
Our perp is dressed like me.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.076
And he's not "our" perp.[siren wailing]

13:36.119 --> 13:38.556
He's myperp. Mine.
You don't wear a badge.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.255
You were dressed like a Ranger
lurking by a car

13:41.298 --> 13:43.561
that was stolen by someone
impersonating a Ranger.

13:43.605 --> 13:46.477
Anyone would have come
to the same conclusion I did.It ever

13:46.521 --> 13:47.565
occur to you that
your little stunt back there

13:47.609 --> 13:48.610
probably scared away
our suspect?

13:48.653 --> 13:49.741
You said "our suspect."

13:49.785 --> 13:51.091
I said...[car door opens]

13:51.134 --> 13:52.744
You are unbelievable.

13:52.788 --> 13:55.312
On the ground now.
Hands where I can see them.

13:55.356 --> 13:56.966
Thank you, Officer.
I-I got this.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.099
I'm talking to you, too, buddy.
I've located the stolen vehicle

13:59.142 --> 14:01.623
and the 37.11.No, no, no, no.
I-I'm not the imposter.

14:01.666 --> 14:02.798
I'm a Texas Ranger.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.626
Cordell Walker.

14:04.669 --> 14:06.715
This guy thinks he's the Ranger
who's always in the news.

14:06.758 --> 14:07.803
CASSIE:
Told you anyone would have come

14:07.847 --> 14:09.152
to the same conclusion.

14:11.546 --> 14:15.115
Yep. Sure. Uh, let's just, uh...

14:15.158 --> 14:16.246
Let's get this over with.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.255
I have serious doubts
her Taser is even legal.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.214
I think she jailbroke it
to add extra juice

14:27.257 --> 14:29.259
to take out
a guy like me.

14:29.303 --> 14:30.652
[James laughs]

14:30.695 --> 14:33.394
I'm s... She apologized

14:33.437 --> 14:34.569
for the tasing several times.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.136
Mm-hmm.Okay, what about...

14:36.179 --> 14:37.746
what about the-the hitting
the potholes thing?

14:37.789 --> 14:39.704
She didn't apologize for that.Okay, I don't control potholes.

14:39.748 --> 14:42.316
JAMES:
Okay, enough. Okay,
listen, mistakes were made.

14:42.359 --> 14:43.404
She said sorry.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.319
Frankly, anybody in her shoes

14:45.362 --> 14:46.581
would've reached
the same conclusion.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.366
Okay. Cassandra Perez.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.281
You were the youngest cadet

14:51.325 --> 14:54.284
at DPS academy,
graduated top of your class.

14:54.328 --> 14:55.851
First female Ranger
in Dallas

14:55.895 --> 14:57.331
under Captain Cole.CASSIE:Yeah.

14:57.374 --> 14:59.594
He only hired me after
you changed the landscape

14:59.637 --> 15:01.683
after you hired Ranger Ramirez.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.163
JAMES:
Hmm.

15:03.206 --> 15:05.513
But Cole
never really had my back.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.428
So, is that why you took

15:07.471 --> 15:09.169
an indefinite leave of absence
after only

15:09.212 --> 15:10.648
four months on the job?

15:10.692 --> 15:11.519
How is any of this relevant?

15:11.562 --> 15:13.216
Walker...

15:13.260 --> 15:14.652
I, uh, I took a leave

15:14.696 --> 15:17.525
after my partner was abducted
in the line of duty

15:17.568 --> 15:22.747
and my captain designated
Miles "presumed dead."

15:22.791 --> 15:24.706
Okay, I can understand
needing some time off

15:24.749 --> 15:26.186
after losing a partner,
but you've been on leave

15:26.229 --> 15:27.404
for almost
six months now.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.668
Why not return to the force?

15:30.712 --> 15:32.192
Because Miles is still alive.

15:32.235 --> 15:35.717
I don't have the evidence--
I know that-- but...

15:35.760 --> 15:37.545
too much just doesn't add up.

15:37.588 --> 15:38.938
There's more to the story.

15:42.767 --> 15:45.901
Is there any chance you'd want
to help us out on this case?

15:45.945 --> 15:48.251
What? Cap-Captain,
she's not even a Ranger...

15:48.295 --> 15:49.774
I-I don't need help.
I don't need herhelp.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.428
JAMES:
Walker, she's got insight
that we don't.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.909
She's motivated; this guy
is impersonating her partner

15:53.953 --> 15:55.476
and he's still out there.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.913
So I'm asking you to catch him
together, all right?

15:57.957 --> 16:01.003
Captain, I understand
why he needs my help.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.918
That much is clear.Oh, is it clear?

16:02.962 --> 16:04.398
Is it?

16:04.441 --> 16:06.400
Because you,
you've been lone-wolfing it

16:06.443 --> 16:07.836
for, what, six months,

16:07.879 --> 16:09.316
and the closest you've come
to finding Ranger Vyas

16:09.359 --> 16:10.665
is today's screwup?

16:10.708 --> 16:13.581
You're right.
But this case is personal.

16:13.624 --> 16:17.019
So even if it's only temporary,
I can't work with someone

16:17.063 --> 16:18.847
who doesn't bring something
to the table themselves.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.414
WALKER:
I'm a Texas Ranger.

16:20.457 --> 16:22.677
That's what I bring
to the table.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.418
[chuckles]:
Okay, tough guy, but what else?

16:24.461 --> 16:26.681
What makes you a good
partner on this?

16:29.379 --> 16:31.512
I don't need to explain
myself to you.

16:31.555 --> 16:34.689
I don't work with people
I can't trust.

16:35.864 --> 16:38.823
It was a pleasure
meeting you, Captain.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.740
[door opens]

16:42.784 --> 16:44.873
[door closes]

16:48.485 --> 16:49.834
Dude, I can't believe
Todd left us high and dry.

16:51.488 --> 16:52.533
No, we're never
getting in.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.361
Todd's not answering.
I'm worried.

16:54.404 --> 16:55.536
No, don't be.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.146
He probably just
wanted the credit

16:57.190 --> 16:58.974
for getting us tickets and had
no way to actually deliver.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.628
No, that's not Todd.
He wouldn't just...

17:00.671 --> 17:01.803
Stella, yes, he would.

17:01.846 --> 17:03.674
Same way he hogs credit
for our band.

17:03.718 --> 17:05.850
You know that song
at The Side Step?

17:05.894 --> 17:07.330
No, he-he didn't...

17:07.374 --> 17:09.376
Okay, he-he didn't even

17:09.419 --> 17:10.986
get the lyrics
when he read 'em.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.466
AUGUST:
Hey, yo, I-I-I, uh,

17:12.509 --> 17:13.945
I think I just saw
the Straightjackets'

17:13.989 --> 17:15.469
keyboard player over there.
Want to go check it out?

17:15.512 --> 17:17.471
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.Let's do it.

17:17.514 --> 17:19.821
[rock music playing in distance]

17:19.864 --> 17:22.041
I didn't actually see
Kevin VanSchlinker.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.999
I just, um...

17:24.043 --> 17:25.653
I feel like you were
gonna tell my sister

17:25.696 --> 17:27.046
that that song was about her.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.395
Oh, no, I-I wasn't...

17:28.438 --> 17:29.831
She's still not over
Trevor Strand, all right?

17:29.874 --> 17:31.354
Todd's the first guy
after him.

17:31.398 --> 17:34.488
And-and I like Todd,
it's just...

17:34.531 --> 17:35.750
he's kind of a fling.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.534
So she'll be
sick of him

17:37.578 --> 17:38.666
in, like, a week.Okay,

17:38.709 --> 17:40.102
thank-thanks
for the heads-up?Yeah.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.625
Yeah, you know,
I'd hate for you to be

17:41.669 --> 17:42.931
the guy my sister doesn't
want around, all right?

17:42.974 --> 17:45.325
Because starting this band's
been fun.

17:45.368 --> 17:47.762
And so is hanging out, so, uh...

17:49.024 --> 17:51.070
Just let the Todd fling
run its course, yeah.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.637
I'm gonna go check on Todd.Yeah, I-I'm-- I'll drive you.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.558
Thanks.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.778
I'll make sure the techs, uh,
check it for fingerprints

18:03.821 --> 18:05.475
and do a sweep.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.390
I always wanted a car like that.
Kelly said it was impractical.

18:07.434 --> 18:08.696
Not enough trunk space.

18:09.740 --> 18:10.741
Based on your research,

18:10.785 --> 18:12.656
what do you think?Very funny.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.702
Well, off to Paititi
it goes, huh?

18:14.745 --> 18:17.052
Yeah, by the way,
what is that?

18:17.096 --> 18:19.359
The warehouse where DPS keeps
all their asset forfeitures.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.578
Yes, I-I know that,
but, uh, "Paititi."

18:21.622 --> 18:23.406
Wh-What is that, that word?
Where does it come from?

18:23.450 --> 18:25.104
Lost city of gold. Paititi.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.844
Paititi? Paititi.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.107
I don't know.
Huh.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.978
I bet Cassie would
know that one.
[scoffs]

18:30.021 --> 18:32.894
Look, she's not gonna stop
looking for her partner.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.723
You guys are gonna be
on the same path anyway.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.681
Wait, h-hold up, Cap.

18:37.725 --> 18:38.900
You're trying to Parent Trapme.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.816
That's a clear violation
of rule number 42.

18:41.859 --> 18:43.818
Need I remind you,
we made those rules

18:43.861 --> 18:45.646
because we used to fight
all the time

18:45.689 --> 18:46.908
in the beginning.

18:46.951 --> 18:48.518
But we also pushed
each other in the direction

18:48.562 --> 18:50.390
that we needed to be pushed.I'm just saying,

18:50.433 --> 18:52.435
I don't think she has
what it takes.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.437
Well, she's got
what it takes to locate

18:54.481 --> 18:55.786
a stolen vehicle
without department resources.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.397
She's also got
what it takes

18:57.440 --> 18:59.747
to force a moose like you

18:59.790 --> 19:01.836
into the trunk of a car.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.577
Unarmed, mind you.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.753
Uh, she had a Taser.
Please.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.755
She tased me. She...

19:07.798 --> 19:09.670
Okay, all right, all right.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.019
All right, here you go.

19:11.062 --> 19:13.848
Even if I-I agreed
to the partnership--

19:13.891 --> 19:15.197
which is a big "if"--

19:15.241 --> 19:17.982
she didn't show
any indication whatsoever

19:18.026 --> 19:19.767
that she wanted
to partner with me.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.160
What about all those questions
she was asking you?

19:21.203 --> 19:22.596
You don't think
she was trying to get an idea

19:22.639 --> 19:23.771
of what it might be like
to work with you?

19:23.814 --> 19:25.860
Look, if you think
there's a chance--

19:25.903 --> 19:28.602
because I do--
you got to meet her halfway.

19:28.645 --> 19:30.952
You can't just wait for her
to come knocking on your door,

19:30.995 --> 19:32.562

Good day, ma'am.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.135
I'm here about
the ranch hand position.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.180
Oh.

CASSIE:
Wow, that's one hell

19:47.969 --> 19:49.449
Well, I'm sorry I couldn't give
you the full tour, but, um,

19:49.492 --> 19:52.234
you came in
kind of late, so... Oh.

19:52.278 --> 19:53.409
Liam.Yeah.

19:53.453 --> 19:55.803
I didn't realize
you were home.

19:55.846 --> 19:56.978
Yeah, Mama, I thought I'd cook

19:57.021 --> 19:58.545
dinner for you
since Dad's out of town.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.460
Sorry, I'm-I'm
being rude.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.113
I'm Liam.Cassandra.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.028
And I know who you are.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.073
I voted for you for D.A.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.162
It's a shame
you didn't win.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.686
That new D.A.?

20:11.601 --> 20:13.560
Uh, well, I have some pots
on the stove right now,

20:13.603 --> 20:15.214

nice to meet you.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.477

20:17.520 --> 20:18.608

20:20.610 --> 20:22.656
Hey, you have another son.

20:22.699 --> 20:24.048
Didn't I hear that?Cordell.

20:24.092 --> 20:25.136
Huh.
Yes.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.138
He's a Texas Ranger.

20:27.182 --> 20:28.531
CASSIE:
A Ranger?

20:28.575 --> 20:30.054
He never considered ranching?

20:30.098 --> 20:31.969
Well, not for very long.
He took a leave from the Rangers

20:32.013 --> 20:34.624
once to focus on family,
this place, but...

20:34.668 --> 20:37.018
What did his partner think
when he left?

20:37.061 --> 20:38.933
His partner?

20:41.240 --> 20:45.026
Well, um, she was
pretty much family

20:45.069 --> 20:46.201
at that point.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.768
She understood.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.987
She had Cordell's back,
he had hers.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.946
And I think it's what
gave her the strength

20:51.989 --> 20:53.817
to put down the
badge herself.

20:53.861 --> 20:56.080
But she will always have
a place at our table.

20:57.778 --> 21:00.520
Are there any
other questions?

21:00.563 --> 21:03.087
Uh, I'm sorry.
Am I being too nosy?

21:03.131 --> 21:05.699
For a ranch hand?
Well, I'd say so.

21:05.742 --> 21:07.135
But you are no ranch hand.

21:07.178 --> 21:10.312
You don't know the difference
between a muck fork

21:10.356 --> 21:11.966
and a pitchfork,

21:12.009 --> 21:15.665

really interested in is Cordell,

21:15.709 --> 21:17.319

21:17.363 --> 21:18.799
May I hazard a guess?
