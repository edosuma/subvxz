WEBVTT

01:07.333 --> 01:11.290
"Nearly 800 years ago,
Monk Bodhi came to China from India."

01:13.666 --> 01:17.415
"He stayed in the royal palace for 3 years."

01:18.208 --> 01:23.415
"He then remained in the Jinhua mountains,
mastering the art of kung fu."

01:24.791 --> 01:29.707
"After he died, he was buried at Mt Xionger,"

01:31.041 --> 01:35.165
"but later his remains were stolen"

01:35.875 --> 01:40.124
"and split into two halves"

01:41.666 --> 01:44.165
"Later, a rumour arose.
Whomever possessed his remains"

01:44.375 --> 01:47.332
"could master kung fu
and rule the martial arts universe"

01:48.041 --> 01:50.915
"Since then, many battles have been fought
in a quest to obtain the remains"

01:52.708 --> 01:59.332
"Now, the Dark Stone, a secret guild of assassins,
has entered the violent battle."

02:00.916 --> 02:03.249
"Recently, there has been a rumor
that 1/2 of the remains"

02:03.458 --> 02:05.540
"are in the hands of Minister Zhang Haiduan"

02:14.708 --> 02:16.915
"Zhang Haiduan's Residence"

02:21.250 --> 02:23.457
"Zhang Haiduan"

02:24.000 --> 02:26.165
"Drizzle: Dark Stone Assassin"

02:27.000 --> 02:29.040
"Lei Bin: Dark Stone Assassin"

02:31.333 --> 02:33.499
"Zhang Renfeng: Minister's son"

02:35.666 --> 02:37.665
"The Magician: Dark Stone Assassin"

02:48.166 --> 02:50.165
"The Wheel King: Dark Stone Clan Leader"

02:57.000 --> 02:58.790
"The Dark Stone assassins. . ."

02:59.000 --> 03:00.790
"have raided the Minister's Residence
and killed him and his son Renfeng"

03:00.958 --> 03:03.499
"Amidst the chaos,
Drizzle makes off with Bodhi's remains"

03:03.666 --> 03:06.374
"and disappears without a trace"

03:08.666 --> 03:12.457
"Some years later..."

03:21.000 --> 03:24.290
"The Capital"

03:25.333 --> 03:26.165
Are you Mrs Cai?

03:28.125 --> 03:29.999
I've heard you have a house for rent

03:31.416 --> 03:33.582
This was Dr Huang's house

03:33.875 --> 03:35.749
He returned to his village last year

03:39.291 --> 03:42.415
The house has been empty since then

03:48.333 --> 03:49.624
This house is very big

03:50.000 --> 03:51.124
Will you be living here alone?

03:51.875 --> 03:52.582
Yes

03:53.666 --> 03:55.582
The monthly rent is 3.2 taels of gold

03:56.041 --> 03:58.790
but if you take it now,
I'll reduce it to just 3 taels

03:59.416 --> 04:01.582
I'll take it. Here is a three month deposit

04:03.208 --> 04:05.957
Wonderful. I will bring the contract tomorrow

04:07.083 --> 04:09.582
Oh, I still haven't asked you your name

04:09.833 --> 04:12.874
Zeng Jing

04:34.708 --> 04:37.249
As soon as you deliver the head of Drizzle

04:37.458 --> 04:40.415
to the bank in Luoyang City

04:40.666 --> 04:42.415
you will be rewarded by the Dark Stone

04:42.708 --> 04:44.249
with 50,000 taels of gold

04:45.250 --> 04:47.540
as well as the 800,000 taels of silver

04:48.125 --> 04:50.082
that Drizzle is carrying with her

04:52.666 --> 04:53.582
Please put the new bricks here

04:55.916 --> 04:57.332
and take out the old bricks

05:00.708 --> 05:01.457
Wait

05:04.166 --> 05:06.582
Who gets to keep the remains of Bodhi
from Drizzle?

05:08.958 --> 05:10.415
According to the rules of
the martial arts universe,

05:10.750 --> 05:12.999
it is finders, keepers

05:13.416 --> 05:16.165
We are not afraid

05:16.541 --> 05:17.624
of the Dark Stone

05:18.250 --> 05:20.332
If we capture the remains of Bodhi,

05:20.541 --> 05:21.790
then they are ours to keep

05:27.916 --> 05:29.124
Be careful

05:29.541 --> 05:30.332
Slowly

05:32.125 --> 05:33.290
Put the four cabinets against the wall

05:33.458 --> 05:34.915
and put the vanity inside

05:42.291 --> 05:44.374
Drizzle has left Shanxi Province

05:44.583 --> 05:46.290
She is heading South

05:46.625 --> 05:47.749
and will be near Huizhou

05:48.458 --> 05:49.957
in a few days

05:54.375 --> 05:56.957
Give me one

06:10.416 --> 06:12.165
I am willing to turn into a stone bridge

06:13.333 --> 06:15.790
and endure 500 years of wind and rain

06:18.000 --> 06:20.999
The Dark Stone is the hidden power at court

06:21.625 --> 06:26.332
It is said that they hold the lives

06:27.166 --> 06:30.707
of all the officials and mandarins in their hands

06:30.916 --> 06:32.999
I've heard that Bodhi's remains

06:33.291 --> 06:34.832
are now in Drizzle's hands

06:35.833 --> 06:37.832
Drizzle's 41 stroke Water-Shedding Sword maneuver

06:38.833 --> 06:39.832
is incredibly fast

06:40.750 --> 06:42.040
It showers the victim with a barrage of slashes

06:43.375 --> 06:45.915
so they look they have been cut by drizzling rain

06:46.125 --> 06:47.457
We must work together to kill her

06:47.875 --> 06:50.665
and divide the silver equally amongst ourselves

07:14.958 --> 07:15.665
Sister

08:35.375 --> 08:36.999
Do you think your kung fu is good enough

08:37.957 --> 08:42.249
Once you enter the martial arts world,
there is no getting out

08:44.125 --> 08:49.332
We will be waiting for you in Hell

09:35.583 --> 09:38.374
For performing this surgery to change your face,

09:39.250 --> 09:41.499
I have one other condition -

09:42.583 --> 09:44.957
I need to know why you are doing this.

09:49.583 --> 09:50.332
That night

09:50.916 --> 09:52.415
I carried the remains with me to the bridge

09:53.125 --> 09:54.499
and just as I was leaving the city

09:55.708 --> 09:57.374
You killed my father

09:57.541 --> 09:59.707
There was the Minister's son, Zhang Renfeng

10:00.250 --> 10:01.582
Amazingly, he was still alive

10:24.041 --> 10:25.124
I'm late again

10:26.916 --> 10:28.832
Life isn't necessarily happy

10:30.416 --> 10:31.915
Death isn't necessarily painful

10:34.875 --> 10:37.374
That was the first time I saw Wisdom

10:38.208 --> 10:39.540
So you're Drizzle

10:58.291 --> 11:00.624
Four strokes of your sword are incomplete

11:01.458 --> 11:02.374
So what?

11:03.458 --> 11:04.749
I worry that one day

11:05.333 --> 11:08.999
you'll meet a real master and be cut to pieces

11:11.208 --> 11:12.165
Turn around

11:12.958 --> 11:13.749
Look at me

11:14.625 --> 11:15.999
I can't look at you again

11:18.333 --> 11:19.624
In a few more days,

11:20.625 --> 11:22.790
I will become a monk

11:24.041 --> 11:26.415
You're only telling me now?

11:27.416 --> 11:29.874
Then why have you been with me for 3 months?

11:30.708 --> 11:31.915
After we part today,

11:33.083 --> 11:35.332
I will recite prayers for you day and night,

11:35.500 --> 11:37.332
and ask Buddha to forgive you

11:38.125 --> 11:39.832
and to make you awaken and let go

11:41.916 --> 11:43.165
Let go of all the paths to dharma

11:44.958 --> 11:47.249
Let go of all the suffering in the world

11:48.625 --> 11:50.040
And sail across the the bitter sea

11:51.250 --> 11:52.832
until you reach Nirvana

11:56.083 --> 11:57.290
Let go

11:58.958 --> 12:00.165
Can you let go?

12:01.458 --> 12:04.124
I will kill everyone in the temple you are joining

12:05.083 --> 12:08.124
The old and the young will all die

12:09.416 --> 12:10.332
Wait

12:16.125 --> 12:17.124
Today,

12:18.875 --> 12:20.915
I shall sever this karmic bond

12:21.375 --> 12:22.749
and sever my ties with you

12:24.541 --> 12:25.624
Hide weakness in deftness

12:29.958 --> 12:31.040
Use both darkness and light

12:47.583 --> 12:50.665
Reveal clarity in obscurity

13:03.625 --> 13:04.499
In surrender become strong

13:15.041 --> 13:17.249
These 4 moves can beat your Water-Shedding Sword

13:18.041 --> 13:19.249
You will be killed

13:26.333 --> 13:27.040
Strike

13:40.416 --> 13:42.082
The window of opportunity has arrived

13:53.500 --> 13:56.082
If you can put down the sword in your hand

13:56.666 --> 13:58.165
and leave this path,

14:00.375 --> 14:02.374
I am happy to be

14:02.833 --> 14:04.457
the last person you kill

14:18.958 --> 14:20.540
Pack up Bodhi's remains

14:21.333 --> 14:23.457
and take them to the Yunhe Temple in Nanjing

14:23.958 --> 14:26.624
Give them to the monk named Delusion

14:27.833 --> 14:29.749
The secret of the remains is...

14:37.916 --> 14:38.749
Doctor,

14:39.500 --> 14:41.040
I want a face that will blend in

14:42.375 --> 14:44.290
so that I can live hidden in the city

14:44.791 --> 14:46.040
and lead a normal life?

14:46.625 --> 14:47.665
Think it through

14:48.583 --> 14:50.332
After you drink this medicine,

14:51.083 --> 14:52.499
you will be a different person

14:56.333 --> 14:58.499
I don't want to ever see this face again

15:01.708 --> 15:04.540
First, I will take some poisonous insects

15:05.000 --> 15:06.874
and place them in your nasal cavity

15:07.333 --> 15:08.915
The medicine will lead them to your cheek bones,

15:09.125 --> 15:11.999
where they will eat part of the bone

15:13.041 --> 15:16.374
Then I will slice open your face,
take out the bugs

15:17.458 --> 15:21.332
and use gold thread to sew up your face

15:21.875 --> 15:26.249
3 months later, the operation will be complete

15:43.958 --> 15:50.957
"Zeng Jing's tombstone"

15:52.000 --> 15:57.332
When Wisdom was 6, he listened to me read mantras

15:57.875 --> 16:00.457
When he was 1 0, he went to Shaolin

16:01.083 --> 16:03.582
and studied martial arts

16:04.250 --> 16:06.749
That was 27 years ago

16:07.416 --> 16:10.207
All of the monks in the temple

16:10.666 --> 16:12.915
said he was their number one master

16:13.291 --> 16:16.374
in both Buddhist teachings and martial arts

16:16.833 --> 16:17.749
Master,

16:18.375 --> 16:20.040
before he died, he said

16:20.375 --> 16:21.790
the window of opportunity has arrived

16:24.208 --> 16:27.332
Buddha can only help those seeking enlightenment

16:28.000 --> 16:31.332
When the window passes, the chance is lost

16:32.291 --> 16:33.957
And if the window has not yet arrived,

16:34.125 --> 16:36.290
then the effort is wasted

16:37.041 --> 16:37.874
What does "I would turn

16:38.083 --> 16:40.332
into a bridge for 500 years

16:40.541 --> 16:41.999
And endure the wind and rain"

16:42.333 --> 16:43.415
mean?

16:43.958 --> 16:46.832
Before one of Buddha's disciples became a monk

16:47.041 --> 16:49.457
he met a beautiful girl

16:50.583 --> 16:53.749
and fell in love with her

16:53.958 --> 16:57.957
Buddha asked him "How much do you love her?"

16:58.666 --> 16:59.999
And he answered

17:00.500 --> 17:02.999
he would turn into a stone bridge

17:05.375 --> 17:07.582
and endure 500 years of wind,

17:09.000 --> 17:10.749
500 years of sunlight

17:12.125 --> 17:14.957
and 500 years of rain

17:15.165 --> 17:18.999
He only asked that the girl
would walk over the bridge

17:23.958 --> 17:26.874
He was good to you

17:28.625 --> 17:30.874
Live your life well

17:32.000 --> 17:33.582
When you feel unsettled

17:34.458 --> 17:36.082
just come and visit me

17:51.958 --> 17:54.957
Letter and parcel courier

17:55.333 --> 17:58.665
1 7 coins within the city

17:58.916 --> 18:02.957
20 coins for up to 3 miles out of the city

18:03.375 --> 18:06.040
1 tael of gold for cross-country delivery

18:11.333 --> 18:11.915
Jiang Ah-Sheng,

18:12.125 --> 18:14.665
quickly take this ginseng to the Liu residence

18:14.916 --> 18:18.124
His mother is dying.
This will give her a little more time

18:19.500 --> 18:20.957
Ok. No problem

18:21.583 --> 18:22.332
Quickly

18:40.125 --> 18:40.832
Give it to me

18:50.833 --> 18:51.499
Auntie

18:54.291 --> 18:55.957
- There you are.
- Here is this month's rent

18:58.375 --> 18:59.374
How about a cup of tea?

18:59.750 --> 19:00.415
Sure

19:00.833 --> 19:02.832
This is the perfect weather for tea

19:03.958 --> 19:04.582
Here

19:28.500 --> 19:29.290
Your fabric is all falling down

19:30.791 --> 19:31.540
Let me help you

19:42.625 --> 19:43.290
Many thanks

19:44.750 --> 19:45.790
You're welcome

19:51.958 --> 19:54.457
That's Jiang Ah-Sheng

19:54.833 --> 19:56.165
He just moved here last month

19:56.458 --> 19:57.915
He's a courier

19:58.666 --> 20:00.957
He's single. Just like you

20:01.958 --> 20:03.999
But that will all change soon

20:04.375 --> 20:07.457
I've already arranged everything for tonight

20:07.708 --> 20:08.415
Wait a minute

20:09.125 --> 20:10.624
I already said I'm not going

20:10.833 --> 20:12.665
If you don't go, there will be trouble

20:14.250 --> 20:15.832
You've taken people's money again, haven't you?

20:17.625 --> 20:20.707
He's come all the way from the Ten Mile Bridge
just to see you

20:21.875 --> 20:23.082
The least you could do is take a look

20:23.541 --> 20:26.124
If you don't like him, you can leave anytime

20:26.875 --> 20:27.665
I'm leaving

20:31.458 --> 20:32.874
You can't leave. You just got here

20:34.666 --> 20:35.999
He's the one?

20:38.750 --> 20:39.999
I don't like him

20:40.750 --> 20:42.874
So you don't like butcher Zhu

20:43.333 --> 20:45.374
How about bamboo digger Zhou?

20:48.208 --> 20:49.457
Coolie Su?

20:53.041 --> 20:54.665
What about farmer Fang?

20:56.708 --> 20:57.707
I really have to go

21:00.500 --> 21:02.290
Just how many people did you take money from?

21:03.375 --> 21:04.082
Which of them

21:04.625 --> 21:07.124
are not here for matchmaking?

21:13.333 --> 21:14.915
Auntie, I know you're doing it for my own good

21:15.125 --> 21:16.790
but please don't do it again.

21:17.583 --> 21:20.582
Jing

21:27.416 --> 21:28.207
Auntie,

21:28.916 --> 21:29.749
What are we eating tonight?

21:32.125 --> 21:34.832
Ah-Sheng, Auntie has a question for you

21:36.833 --> 21:40.957
"Fatty Chen's oil shop"

22:15.875 --> 22:17.290
The Magistrate of Xuzhou:

22:18.041 --> 22:19.957
1 50,000 taels of silver

22:35.666 --> 22:37.040
The Prefect of Hangzhou:

22:41.500 --> 22:42.499
One...

22:45.166 --> 22:47.332
Fatty Chen, you've managed to keep up your kung fu

22:53.666 --> 22:54.457
Lei Bin

22:55.791 --> 22:57.124
You're early

22:57.333 --> 22:58.707
Your bird is still alive?

22:58.916 --> 22:59.749
You

23:02.125 --> 23:03.332
Even if you die

23:04.125 --> 23:05.415
it will still be alive

23:06.208 --> 23:07.249
If you keep harassing

23:07.708 --> 23:09.332
my pet bird,

23:11.083 --> 23:12.332
I'll kill you

23:17.375 --> 23:18.124
Chief

23:23.750 --> 23:24.707
Here are this month's accounts

23:25.041 --> 23:28.165
showing the tribute paid by the mandarins

23:29.708 --> 23:31.332
Any news on Drizzle's whereabouts?

23:31.958 --> 23:32.915
For more than a year,

23:33.166 --> 23:36.040
our spies have checked the key
spots of the Capital

23:36.250 --> 23:39.040
My guess is she has left the Capital

23:39.250 --> 23:41.124
And the other half of Bodhi's remains?

23:41.708 --> 23:44.040
Some have said they are in hands of
the Kongdong Sect

23:44.375 --> 23:47.582
And others have said they are here
in the capital with Zhang Dajing

23:47.791 --> 23:48.832
Find out immediately

23:49.041 --> 23:49.707
I will

23:50.500 --> 23:54.040
Also, Drizzle's replacement
has already been selected

23:54.250 --> 23:57.124
The Magician has already caught up with her

23:57.916 --> 23:59.124
Where is she?

24:00.500 --> 24:01.165
Hebei Province

24:01.916 --> 24:02.707
Tongzhou County

24:03.291 --> 24:04.415
Turquoise Ye is hereby found guilty

24:05.500 --> 24:07.499
of murdering three people

24:07.750 --> 24:10.332
Unwilling to marry her fiance, Wang Chongli,

24:10.666 --> 24:12.582
she secretly carried a dagger

24:12.750 --> 24:14.415
and used it on her wedding night

24:14.791 --> 24:17.415
to kill Wang and his parents

24:18.583 --> 24:21.082
This was a premeditated murder,

24:21.458 --> 24:23.082
and she will not be shown clemency

24:24.416 --> 24:26.915
She is hereby sentenced to be executed

24:27.291 --> 24:29.832
The punishment is to be carried out tomorrow

24:47.291 --> 24:49.832
This is your last meal

25:37.041 --> 25:37.749
What are you doing?

25:39.666 --> 25:40.457
What is it?

25:45.541 --> 25:47.290
Just write it like this:

25:48.000 --> 25:50.790
The murderer Turquoise Ye's limbs are all cold

25:51.166 --> 25:52.665
She has no pulse

25:53.500 --> 25:54.499
The cause of death?

25:55.416 --> 25:57.415
She committed suicide by poison to avoid beheading

25:58.125 --> 25:59.457
Her identity and death have been confirmed

26:00.208 --> 26:01.290
The body can be buried

26:01.708 --> 26:03.165
Notify her family that they can pick up the body

26:30.041 --> 26:32.582
Who are you? Did you bury me in this coffin?

26:33.958 --> 26:35.040
This is tortoise powder

26:35.250 --> 26:36.332
Once you ingest it,

26:37.666 --> 26:41.582
for the next twenty-four hours

26:41.750 --> 26:43.124
as if you're really dead

26:43.333 --> 26:44.207
Screw your tortoise powder

26:44.583 --> 26:46.290
Do you know how scary it was?

26:46.500 --> 26:47.332
I may have looked dead,

26:47.541 --> 26:48.915
but I could hear everything

26:53.291 --> 26:54.582
From this day forward,

26:55.250 --> 26:58.040
I am your father.

26:58.375 --> 27:00.457
and the Dark Stone is your mother

27:00.750 --> 27:03.290
I will teach you kung fu and swordplay

27:03.791 --> 27:05.457
You've already died once

27:05.875 --> 27:09.415
You can either join us or die again

27:29.291 --> 27:30.624
Look, it's going to rain again

27:31.625 --> 27:32.999
Quick, let's pack things up

27:33.208 --> 27:35.624
Pack up the clothes

27:42.083 --> 27:42.999
Here, give me a hand

27:48.875 --> 27:49.582
Auntie

27:53.458 --> 27:53.832
It's starting to rain

27:54.041 --> 27:56.665
It's going to rain. Help me pack

28:01.166 --> 28:01.957
Let me help you pack up

28:06.208 --> 28:07.165
Wait for me

28:21.458 --> 28:23.749
It's going to rain for a while

28:23.958 --> 28:26.749
Don't stand outside. Come in and have a cup of tea

28:28.166 --> 28:28.915
Drink some tea...

28:29.125 --> 28:30.374
That sounds good

28:30.875 --> 28:33.374
she secretly carried a dagger

28:33.583 --> 28:34.540
Why don't you try them?

28:35.166 --> 28:35.957
Dried fruits...

28:37.000 --> 28:37.915
I like those too

28:39.708 --> 28:40.957
Thanks for your help today

28:45.833 --> 28:46.707
Damned weather

28:47.375 --> 28:50.707
Why doesn't it rain more
so I'll have some business?

28:54.416 --> 28:57.082
A few more drops wouldn't kill you, would it?

29:02.791 --> 29:04.332
What do you think of Jiang Ah-Sheng?

29:04.625 --> 29:05.415
What do you mean?

29:05.916 --> 29:08.999
He's been asking about you recently

29:09.833 --> 29:10.582
About me?

29:11.833 --> 29:12.749
What does he want to know?

29:12.958 --> 29:15.374
You know, how old you are, if you're married,

29:15.583 --> 29:16.999
about your family

29:17.583 --> 29:19.499
As soon as he asked me,

29:19.708 --> 29:21.665
I knew what he was thinking

29:22.583 --> 29:23.415
What is he thinking?

29:23.625 --> 29:25.749
Jiang Ah-Sheng is single

29:25.916 --> 29:26.832
Wait a minute

29:27.583 --> 29:29.707
No more matchmaking

29:33.750 --> 29:35.999
Forgive me if I'm being too direct

29:36.208 --> 29:37.249
For women,

29:37.541 --> 29:40.707
the most important thing is to find a man

29:46.916 --> 29:48.790
Okay, don't worry

29:53.625 --> 29:54.665
The money?

29:55.625 --> 29:58.332
Thank you

30:14.291 --> 30:15.749
Ten Mile Bridge

30:16.250 --> 30:19.207
Vermilion Alley, Butcher Zhu

30:23.708 --> 30:25.415
Are you Butcher Zhu?

30:26.666 --> 30:28.790
A white-haired old man asked me
to deliver this letter to you

30:38.083 --> 30:39.707
"Three punches"

30:50.208 --> 30:51.374
What are you rushing for?

30:52.166 --> 30:53.165
It's going to rain

30:54.000 --> 30:55.499
Don't panic. Here

30:55.833 --> 30:58.707
I'll recite a prayer,
and someone will come to help you

30:59.625 --> 31:01.749
Oh great Buddha,

31:01.958 --> 31:03.999
hear Auntie Cai's prayer

31:04.208 --> 31:07.290
Jiang Ah-Sheng, Jiang Ah-Sheng appear at once

31:07.500 --> 31:08.540
What sort of nonsense was that?

31:14.708 --> 31:16.540
Quick, cover the noodles

31:17.958 --> 31:18.624
Auntie

31:22.166 --> 31:24.165
I just happened to be passing by.
Let me help you pack up

31:36.875 --> 31:38.207
What happened to your eye?

31:40.041 --> 31:42.540
I delivered a letter to a lunatic

31:43.208 --> 31:44.957
He punched me in the face

31:47.291 --> 31:47.999
Hey you two,

31:48.291 --> 31:50.999
today the rain will definitely last for a while

31:51.208 --> 31:52.582
Why don't you come in and have some tea?

31:58.041 --> 31:58.749
No thanks

31:59.000 --> 32:00.457
I just drank a lot of water.

32:01.458 --> 32:02.249
You...

32:02.541 --> 32:03.874
You don't seem to be in the mood for tea either

32:24.916 --> 32:25.915
It's a shame

32:26.791 --> 32:28.415
They're dead

33:24.625 --> 33:25.457
I just happened to be passing by

33:26.750 --> 33:28.582
- Let me help you pack up.
- You've just gotten here?

33:30.750 --> 33:31.415
Where is she?

33:31.916 --> 33:33.874
She asked me to keep an eye on her booth

33:34.083 --> 33:35.332
She's been gone for over 4 hours

33:35.833 --> 33:37.957
Here, I'll let you pack it up

33:39.666 --> 33:40.415
Master,

33:41.541 --> 33:42.665
please tell me

33:43.333 --> 33:45.165
that I am lucky enough to start my life over again

33:45.875 --> 33:46.999
Please tell me

33:47.833 --> 33:49.832
if I can really have a fresh start?

33:54.250 --> 33:55.165
Go

33:56.875 --> 34:00.499
The dead shall open the eyes of the living

34:01.333 --> 34:03.540
The heart yearning for the past is unattainable.

34:03.791 --> 34:05.957
The heart yearning for the present is unattainable

34:06.166 --> 34:09.165
The heart yearning for the future is unattainable

34:10.125 --> 34:11.665
The future becomes the present

34:12.000 --> 34:14.706
The present becomes the past

34:15.875 --> 34:19.081
Seek not the heart that connects the three

34:19.666 --> 34:22.623
What is unattainable speaks
not of what can be pursued

34:39.750 --> 34:41.290
I was just passing by. Let me help you pack up

34:41.500 --> 34:43.790
- Auntie
- Don't pack it up

34:44.750 --> 34:46.331
Why? It will get wet

34:46.541 --> 34:47.206
Let it get wet

34:49.750 --> 34:50.873
Why did you come looking for me?

34:52.208 --> 34:54.873
I...

34:55.916 --> 34:57.374
Why did you come looking for me?

35:00.041 --> 35:01.290
Let me ask you something

35:01.500 --> 35:03.374
You have to answer me before it stops raining

35:04.958 --> 35:06.374
I will only ask once

35:06.750 --> 35:07.707
Are you willing or not?

35:10.750 --> 35:11.624
What did you say?

35:12.583 --> 35:13.499
You...

35:18.333 --> 35:19.790
Are you willing to marry me?

35:23.083 --> 35:24.790
First, bow to heaven and earth

35:25.500 --> 35:27.207
Second, bow to your parents

35:27.750 --> 35:31.332
Since all of your parents are dead,
we can skip this step

35:32.041 --> 35:33.540
Now, bow to each other

35:35.208 --> 35:37.374
Now, together you go, into the bridal chamber

35:38.541 --> 35:43.332
"Six months later"

35:59.000 --> 35:59.915
Do you need my help?

36:00.166 --> 36:00.790
No, thanks

36:02.250 --> 36:02.999
Honey,

36:03.208 --> 36:04.332
you really know how to use a knife

36:04.958 --> 36:06.957
I've never seen such perfectly cut tofu

36:25.750 --> 36:27.999
Can you go to the corner and buy some soy sauce?

36:28.250 --> 36:30.915
And then pick up five pounds of rice at the store?

36:31.125 --> 36:32.124
I've already paid for them

36:32.708 --> 36:33.832
All you have to do is pick them up

36:40.458 --> 36:41.665
You haven't left yet?

36:51.333 --> 36:52.499
Just get five pounds

36:52.833 --> 36:54.165
Don't buy more just because it's cheap

36:54.375 --> 36:55.957
Five pounds. Okay

37:06.458 --> 37:07.790
"Fatty Chen's oil shop"

37:21.916 --> 37:24.040
It was an expert. One blow with a machete

37:24.416 --> 37:26.040
This is the fourth one dead in six months

37:30.000 --> 37:31.124
This is Fatty Chen's sword

37:41.208 --> 37:46.499
It wasn't a machete. It was a sword

37:46.708 --> 37:48.624
Whoever killed him used a sword like a machete

37:49.166 --> 37:51.540
They used a sword like a machete

37:52.500 --> 37:53.582
to hide their identity

37:54.416 --> 37:55.415
Could it be Drizzle?

37:56.541 --> 37:57.290
It's not her

37:58.416 --> 37:59.749
It's not her technique

38:01.125 --> 38:02.249
What did they take?

38:02.666 --> 38:03.624
All of the classified files

38:04.166 --> 38:06.332
and the account books showing the money
paid by the mandarins

38:06.958 --> 38:09.249
Any news on Bodhi's remains?

38:09.500 --> 38:11.749
We just received a letter from Henan Province

38:12.416 --> 38:14.415
The Kongdong Sect has sent out two assassins

38:14.625 --> 38:16.707
I think they know where the remains are

38:18.125 --> 38:19.249
They are on their way to the capital

38:19.791 --> 38:20.915
and will arrive within a month

38:22.125 --> 38:23.874
Who are they meeting up with?

38:24.750 --> 38:26.874
It should be Zhang Dajing of the United Bank

38:27.625 --> 38:28.415
Chief,

38:28.916 --> 38:30.999
only Lei Bin is in the capital

38:32.000 --> 38:35.207
Will he be able to defeat both of them?

38:38.416 --> 38:40.207
The herbs were one tael and three coins

38:40.791 --> 38:43.082
The rent is three taels and two coins

38:46.416 --> 38:48.790
The shoes were seven coins

38:49.125 --> 38:50.749
The oil was half a tael

38:50.958 --> 38:53.415
Don't keep reading. We are over-budget this month

38:54.291 --> 38:56.499
We have to pay our taxes to the court next month

38:59.666 --> 39:00.749
Oh, I almost forgot

39:01.583 --> 39:02.790
This is a half-year bank note

39:03.541 --> 39:04.582
I saved bit by bit

39:05.000 --> 39:06.290
It's worth fifteen taels and seven coins

39:06.583 --> 39:08.082
You can cash it in tomorrow

39:09.333 --> 39:11.415
I'll go to the bank tomorrow then

39:13.416 --> 39:15.207
If you had 800,000 taels of silver,

39:15.416 --> 39:16.999
what would you do with it?

39:18.875 --> 39:20.207
If I had 800,000 taels of silver,

39:20.458 --> 39:21.832
you wouldn't be here with me

39:22.000 --> 39:22.749
Why?

39:22.958 --> 39:26.707
Because you would be afraid that I would think

39:27.041 --> 39:28.082
that you were marrying me for the money

39:35.791 --> 39:37.957
"United Bank"

39:47.208 --> 39:48.374
I'll go and get the money

39:48.833 --> 39:49.624
Wait here

40:22.125 --> 40:22.957
Here is your silver

40:23.125 --> 40:25.124
- Thank you.
- Please take it

40:25.291 --> 40:26.040
Immobolize them

41:18.833 --> 41:23.249
Sir, don't be angry.
Please accept this humble gift

41:26.333 --> 41:27.249
Where is the vault?

42:02.791 --> 42:04.874
Sir, those mushrooms are great

42:05.416 --> 42:08.165
They will extend your life

42:10.958 --> 42:13.665
Did anyone deposit a corpse. . .

42:13.875 --> 42:15.749
No, half of a corpse?

42:16.583 --> 42:20.999
Sir, we only accept silver and gold, not bodies

42:21.958 --> 42:23.124
They're robbing the bank

42:23.333 --> 42:25.040
- Call the police
- The police are coming

42:25.875 --> 42:26.832
Brother, the police are coming

43:29.625 --> 43:30.999
Don't worry. Everything will be alright

43:42.875 --> 43:45.290
Brother, this lady is really tough

43:48.625 --> 43:53.082
We brothers came to the capital for business

43:54.208 --> 43:55.540
Sorry for offending you

43:56.291 --> 44:01.540
Please go ahead
if you have nothing to do with this

44:07.083 --> 44:07.874
Then. . .

44:09.000 --> 44:09.749
I will have to offend you

44:10.708 --> 44:11.415
Slaughter her

44:40.250 --> 44:40.832
Let's go

44:41.875 --> 44:44.457
Quickly. Don't let them get away

44:45.791 --> 44:47.207
Freeze. Where are you all going?

44:47.375 --> 44:48.790
Arrest them

44:50.458 --> 44:52.124
Stay back. Stay back

45:12.125 --> 45:13.582
Ah-Sheng, I...

45:22.000 --> 45:23.957
Okay, let's eat

45:26.875 --> 45:28.165
You're not the least bit curious?

45:28.583 --> 45:29.457
It's no big deal

45:29.958 --> 45:32.332
Even if you were a big bandit before,

45:34.500 --> 45:35.707
you're still my wife now

45:43.750 --> 45:44.999
Ahhh, smells good

45:45.625 --> 45:47.249
Today's stew is braised meatballs with vegetables

45:48.125 --> 45:48.957
I'll serve it

46:02.125 --> 46:05.332
I'll ask you one last time,
who else knows about the remains?

46:06.416 --> 46:07.499
I told you before.

46:08.166 --> 46:09.749
The Kongdong Sect said

46:10.125 --> 46:14.374
the banker Zhang Dajing has the remains

46:15.708 --> 46:17.790
So you pretended to rob the bank

46:38.375 --> 46:39.790
Don't worry

46:40.750 --> 46:42.165
It will heal in a few days

46:48.541 --> 46:52.832
So the woman fought empty handed?

46:57.375 --> 46:58.415
She did that on purpose

46:58.833 --> 47:00.665
What was your last move?

47:09.708 --> 47:10.540
Strike

47:21.458 --> 47:23.415
Did she take your sword like this?

47:23.791 --> 47:24.749
How did you know?

47:28.541 --> 47:32.415
Tell me, how were you blinded?

47:53.833 --> 47:55.374
What Ministry are you from?

47:56.333 --> 47:58.415
Why did you drag me out of prison
and bring me here?

47:59.416 --> 48:00.707
I told you everything I know

48:04.416 --> 48:09.707
Call Turquoise, Lei Bin,
and the Magician to the Capital

48:10.458 --> 48:11.165
Yes

48:33.208 --> 48:34.415
I'll show you guys a trick

48:36.250 --> 48:37.082
A bamboo cup,

48:38.000 --> 48:38.665
a bowl,

48:38.875 --> 48:39.624
and some water

48:40.500 --> 48:41.457
Watch carefully

48:45.375 --> 48:46.082
Go

48:49.333 --> 48:50.957
Where did it go? Look here

48:53.791 --> 48:54.540
Arise

48:56.375 --> 48:57.040
Wow

48:57.625 --> 48:58.790
That's incredbile

48:59.750 --> 49:00.624
Now I will turn wine into ice

49:00.833 --> 49:03.457
This is my newest trick; I just learned it

49:03.791 --> 49:06.374
Old Lian, can you turn wine into ice too?

49:06.625 --> 49:08.874
I used to be able to when I was young

49:09.375 --> 49:10.999
Why can't you do it anymore?

49:11.208 --> 49:12.082
Yea, why not?

49:13.083 --> 49:15.582
Because the things I can do now are all those...

49:17.000 --> 49:18.290
real tricks

49:19.166 --> 49:21.415
You're talking about the Magical Flying Rope?

49:21.625 --> 49:23.749
The Magical Flying Rope is only a legend

49:23.958 --> 49:25.540
There is no such thing

49:26.875 --> 49:29.207
Have any of you seen this trick?

49:29.541 --> 49:30.415
No

49:36.583 --> 49:39.082
Didn't you always want to see
the Magical Flying Rope?

49:40.791 --> 49:41.624
Up

49:54.041 --> 49:56.999
Disperse

50:02.500 --> 50:05.749
You have to have real skill to climb up

50:06.375 --> 50:07.249
Can you make it?

50:16.291 --> 50:17.124
I'm going up

50:32.583 --> 50:33.499
What is this?

50:37.291 --> 50:38.249
It's fake

50:39.083 --> 50:40.082
It's a scarecrow

50:41.291 --> 50:42.207
Where is he?

51:35.375 --> 51:36.874
I have to go take care of some things

51:37.791 --> 51:38.999
When will you be back?

51:39.666 --> 51:41.124
In three to five days, if everything goes well

51:45.500 --> 51:47.415
I'm drying some noodles on the roof

51:47.625 --> 51:49.040
Remember to take them down in the morning

51:49.791 --> 51:53.165
People lay out clothes to dry, not noodles

51:54.541 --> 51:56.457
This time it will work

51:57.333 --> 51:59.165
Air dried noodles don't get mushy,

51:59.375 --> 52:01.040
no matter how long you boil them

52:03.791 --> 52:04.832
Come back soon

52:05.458 --> 52:07.624
The kid is waiting for you to cook noodles

52:11.708 --> 52:12.624
That's cold

52:13.708 --> 52:15.707
You want to move back to Changzhou, right?

52:16.791 --> 52:18.040
If everything goes well,

52:18.416 --> 52:19.165
when I come back,

52:19.791 --> 52:21.207
we'll leave the Capital

52:21.500 --> 52:24.749
Maybe open a noodle shop in Changzhou

52:25.541 --> 52:26.374
Okay?

52:27.958 --> 52:28.790
Really?

52:57.875 --> 52:58.749
Miss

52:59.791 --> 53:00.707
Come here

53:02.416 --> 53:03.624
Where are you going?

53:06.250 --> 53:07.040
Come on

53:23.041 --> 53:23.790
Come on, let's go

53:25.208 --> 53:27.624
Hey. You can't do that

53:28.708 --> 53:31.624
Jing, you came at the right time

53:31.875 --> 53:34.457
Take this home

53:34.666 --> 53:38.332
Stir-fry it with jujubes,
angelica, honey and vinegar

53:38.666 --> 53:41.040
Have one bowl each time after your period

53:42.458 --> 53:43.457
Can I eat it?

53:44.500 --> 53:49.332
This is a secret recipe named "Multiple Offspring"

53:51.333 --> 53:52.082
Honey

54:51.916 --> 54:52.665
Honey,

54:53.625 --> 54:54.624
you're home early today

54:55.791 --> 54:57.790
Oh, I forgot some things

54:58.541 --> 54:59.290
I was a bit hungry

55:00.666 --> 55:01.665
and came back to get something to eat

55:20.833 --> 55:21.582
Honey,

55:22.333 --> 55:23.249
my shoe is worn out

55:25.458 --> 55:27.707
Take it off, and I'll repair it tomorrow

55:35.750 --> 55:36.540
What is it?

55:37.750 --> 55:38.665
Oil has become more expensive

55:40.583 --> 55:41.540
Then use a candle

57:20.166 --> 57:21.040
Is that her?

57:22.666 --> 57:26.040
She can change her face,
but she can't change her aura

57:26.375 --> 57:27.207
Aura?

57:28.458 --> 57:31.457
I only see an average housewife repairing shoes

57:32.083 --> 57:33.165
What aura?

57:35.833 --> 57:38.249
You're right. The aura is still there

57:39.666 --> 57:41.457
But the killer instinct is not as strong as before

57:45.958 --> 57:47.124
Your eyes must be bad

57:48.291 --> 57:49.582
Do you really like this man,

57:50.125 --> 57:51.832
or did you just want any man?

58:00.333 --> 58:02.165
I doubt that you're really Drizzle

58:52.958 --> 58:54.915
It's Doctor Li's work

58:56.750 --> 58:57.790
Why?

58:59.416 --> 59:02.832
You didn't like your old face?

59:05.541 --> 59:07.582
Why do you wear a mask?

59:08.208 --> 59:09.582
You don't like your face?

59:20.416 --> 59:23.332
You killed Fatty Chen
and took all the secret files?

59:23.833 --> 59:24.999
If it were me,

59:26.000 --> 59:30.499
both of you would already be dead

59:34.958 --> 59:36.624
You really want to take us on?

59:37.416 --> 59:38.999
That sounds like fun

01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:07.624
Return the remains to the Dark Stone,
and I will let you live

01:00:07.833 --> 01:00:08.832
If you dare say no,

01:00:09.291 --> 01:00:10.124
first I will kill your husband,

01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:12.415
then everyone that you know,

01:00:12.625 --> 01:00:14.332
and finally yourself

01:00:18.208 --> 01:00:20.832
I'll trade you the remains for something

01:00:21.583 --> 01:00:22.457
Trade them for what?

01:00:23.875 --> 01:00:25.665
Me and my husband

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.332
You like him that much?

01:00:35.958 --> 01:00:38.582
If you help me get the other half of the remains,

01:00:38.791 --> 01:00:40.165
I will let you go

01:00:47.166 --> 01:00:49.332
The Kongdong Sect knows where it is

01:00:49.541 --> 01:00:51.290
They will be in the Capital in a few days

01:00:52.625 --> 01:00:55.415
Help me get the remains, and you and I are even

01:00:57.875 --> 01:00:59.082
Don't run away

01:00:59.625 --> 01:01:01.124
You will be watched

01:01:28.458 --> 01:01:31.540
This sore will never heal

01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:33.874
I too want to hide and nurse my wounds

01:01:34.833 --> 01:01:38.707
But once I get the signal from the Dark Stone,
I have to kill again

01:01:40.041 --> 01:01:45.040
Here

01:01:47.291 --> 01:01:50.290
Tell me, why did you really leave?

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:54.207
Was it for the remains or for him?

01:01:56.750 --> 01:02:00.165
Once you start down this path, there is no escape

01:02:01.208 --> 01:02:03.957
No regrets and no way out

01:02:05.083 --> 01:02:06.915
I like this life I have now

01:02:15.125 --> 01:02:15.957
Ok,

01:02:16.708 --> 01:02:18.915
see you in three days at the Yueyang Inn

01:02:45.958 --> 01:02:46.957
"Feng's Residence"

01:02:47.125 --> 01:02:49.249
One million taels of silver

01:02:51.291 --> 01:02:53.499
Two million taels of silver

01:02:56.375 --> 01:02:58.624
Three million taels of silver

01:03:06.708 --> 01:03:10.582
You told me there is no leaving the Dark Stone

01:03:10.916 --> 01:03:11.874
Why let her go?

01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:17.499
You have nerve Pointing a sword at my back?

01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:21.832
There was a reason we picked you.

01:03:22.666 --> 01:03:23.790
Why don't you attack?

01:03:25.541 --> 01:03:26.915
Kill me,

01:03:27.375 --> 01:03:29.332
and these millions of taels

01:03:30.083 --> 01:03:33.957
and the tribute from the mandarins
will all be yours

01:03:35.625 --> 01:03:38.415
You can take my place

01:03:39.291 --> 01:03:43.832
I've heard whoever has the remains
can rule the martial arts world

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:08.332
If you can study the kung fu from the remains,

01:04:08.958 --> 01:04:10.249
then teach it to me

01:04:16.583 --> 01:04:19.040
Put your clothes back on and go

01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:22.665
Until we get the remains,

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:25.040
don't move against Jing and her husband

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:40.999
I like it when you lie on me

01:04:53.416 --> 01:05:00.582
"United Bank"

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:15.374
The Kongdong Purple and Teal swords
are known for their skill

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:17.457
but not their character

01:05:18.625 --> 01:05:20.040
They were master and disciple,

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:21.665
but now they're husband and wife

01:05:22.791 --> 01:05:24.082
What a joke

01:05:24.375 --> 01:05:25.790
If everyone followed their path,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.082
then we would be married

01:05:31.666 --> 01:05:35.957
That's Zhang Dajing of the United Bank

01:05:37.791 --> 01:05:39.665
He's offering a reward of one million taels

01:05:39.875 --> 01:05:41.790
for Bodhi's remains

01:05:42.916 --> 01:05:46.374
He's very rich, but he is a cripple

01:05:47.708 --> 01:05:48.624
Tonight,

01:05:48.791 --> 01:05:51.582
we will strike in the lobby of the bank

01:05:51.875 --> 01:05:52.915
You two will attack

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.915
Don't forget to bring
the other half of the remains

01:06:00.541 --> 01:06:01.665
I really don't understand

01:06:08.041 --> 01:06:09.165
Why would a woman

01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:12.082
whose name makes the martial world tremble

01:06:12.791 --> 01:06:15.624
marry an ugly, poor good-for-nothing?

01:06:16.958 --> 01:06:19.999
Take one. It's really good

01:06:22.833 --> 01:06:23.915
I followed him for three days

01:06:24.916 --> 01:06:27.207
Everyday, he's cleaning horses
and cleaning up their dung

01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:30.832
The only interesting thing he did

01:06:31.166 --> 01:06:34.207
was to buy a whetting stone this morning

01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:37.040
Boss,

01:06:37.875 --> 01:06:38.957
I'll take this one

01:06:42.541 --> 01:06:44.040
Such a hopeless man

01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:45.540
Don't you want to leave him?

01:06:46.375 --> 01:06:47.874
So, I did you a favor

01:06:48.375 --> 01:06:49.165
and killed him

01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:05.582
Your melon is too sweet

01:07:55.708 --> 01:08:02.749
Tofu

01:08:05.041 --> 01:08:07.207
I'll take one

01:08:51.875 --> 01:08:52.665
Strange

01:08:54.875 --> 01:08:57.082
This is the first time
Jing went to the temple at night

01:08:58.457 --> 01:09:00.165
And now a crazy woman appears in our house

01:09:07.541 --> 01:09:08.707
Everyone come look

01:09:08.957 --> 01:09:10.457
There's a crazy woman in my house

01:09:10.791 --> 01:09:12.165
A naked crazy woman

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:13.499
Everyone come and see

01:09:26.707 --> 01:09:27.499
They're here

01:09:45.207 --> 01:09:45.999
You are late

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:57.040
What's that smell?

01:10:00.416 --> 01:10:02.082
1 00,000 taels of gold,

01:10:03.375 --> 01:10:06.415
plus checks for...

01:10:06.625 --> 01:10:09.124
1 million taels of silver

01:10:13.583 --> 01:10:15.249
Those are Bodhi's remains?

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:25.207
Quickly

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:35.499
The blind can see again,

01:10:36.083 --> 01:10:38.749
the deaf can hear again

01:10:40.208 --> 01:10:42.915
And the crippled can re-grow their legs

01:10:43.416 --> 01:10:45.790
As long as I can walk again,

01:10:46.583 --> 01:10:49.165
it's worth all of my family's wealth

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:50.582
Zhang Dajing is going to die

01:10:55.583 --> 01:10:56.415
This is wrong

01:10:56.875 --> 01:10:58.082
It's a fake

01:10:58.458 --> 01:10:59.832
It's fake

01:11:01.916 --> 01:11:04.124
Kill them

01:11:05.583 --> 01:11:06.290
Let's move in

01:11:19.791 --> 01:11:20.499
Let's go

01:11:53.541 --> 01:11:54.415
Who are you?

01:12:08.291 --> 01:12:11.040
I've been a Dark Stone assassin for decades

01:12:11.208 --> 01:12:12.874
Now I am old and sick

01:12:13.791 --> 01:12:16.707
If these remains can really restore your health,

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:19.832
why don't I take them for myself?

01:12:21.833 --> 01:12:22.999
Leave the remains

01:12:29.708 --> 01:12:31.415
I've known you for so long

01:12:31.625 --> 01:12:33.374
yet never faced your sword

01:12:33.625 --> 01:12:34.790
Let's make it today then

01:12:35.458 --> 01:12:38.374
Dark Stoners never fight each other

01:12:39.125 --> 01:12:40.999
But it looks like we'll break the rules today

01:12:42.083 --> 01:12:43.082
Magician,

01:12:43.916 --> 01:12:45.624
you've betrayed me too

01:12:45.875 --> 01:12:47.165
Who betrayed who?

01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:50.790
Why do we always have to risk our lives for you?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.582
And give you everything we earn?

01:12:57.916 --> 01:12:58.915
Let's begin

01:12:59.416 --> 01:13:00.332
Wheel King,

01:13:01.833 --> 01:13:03.249
if you and I fight,

01:13:03.958 --> 01:13:06.415
we don't know who the winner will be

01:13:07.125 --> 01:13:08.999
But if the three of us fight against you,

01:13:12.375 --> 01:13:13.415
there's no way you can win

01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:18.249
If the three of us team up and kill him,

01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:22.540
Drizzle can return to her normal life

01:13:23.458 --> 01:13:24.249
Lei Bin,

01:13:24.708 --> 01:13:27.165
you can keep all of the tribute money

01:13:27.375 --> 01:13:28.374
I just want the remains

01:13:29.125 --> 01:13:30.124
Afterwards,

01:13:31.125 --> 01:13:32.332
we can all go our separate ways

01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:42.207
Here is the other half of the remains

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:46.915
After today,

01:13:47.291 --> 01:13:49.249
I will have nothing more to do with the Dark Stone

01:14:20.333 --> 01:14:21.540
This is fun

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.999
You all actually want to quit

01:14:24.666 --> 01:14:27.665
Three against two - the result is the same

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:00.874
Show me your Water-Shedding sword

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.374
I could have killed you

01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:20.582
I know

01:15:23.041 --> 01:15:24.040
But you didn't

01:15:26.208 --> 01:15:28.415
Because you're no longer Drizzle

01:15:42.166 --> 01:15:43.749
I told you a long time ago,

01:15:44.541 --> 01:15:46.582
if you want to do tricks, then do tricks

01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:48.249
If you want to practice kung fu,
then practice kung fu

01:15:48.791 --> 01:15:51.207
But you always mixed them together

01:15:51.583 --> 01:15:55.165
It's amazing that you've lived this long

01:15:56.041 --> 01:15:56.790
Lei Bin

01:15:57.625 --> 01:16:00.082
Kill Turquoise and help me finish the Wheel King

01:16:00.666 --> 01:16:01.290
Quick

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.124
Flying Rope. Go

01:17:35.958 --> 01:17:38.165
Your magic failed this time

01:17:47.166 --> 01:17:48.874
None of you can beat Drizzle

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.957
But her swordplay has some weaknesses in it

01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:55.332
When I was teaching her
the Water-Shedding Sword maneuver,

01:17:55.541 --> 01:17:57.874
I taught her 4 mistakes

01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:00.415
Watch carefully

01:18:58.333 --> 01:19:00.457
Didn't you always want to know
the Water-Shedding Sword Maneuver?

01:19:16.416 --> 01:19:20.249
Ah-Sheng

01:19:23.708 --> 01:19:24.957
Listen carefully

01:19:25.541 --> 01:19:26.832
Leave the city now

01:19:27.708 --> 01:19:28.832
Go North as fast as you can

01:19:29.833 --> 01:19:31.082
In case I don't make it,

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:32.915
everything about me

01:19:33.541 --> 01:19:36.499
is buried in the Yunhe Temple graveyard

01:19:45.583 --> 01:19:46.582
Honey

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:50.374
It looks like you're in big trouble this time

01:21:40.375 --> 01:21:43.457
You won't feel it. It won't hurt

01:21:43.666 --> 01:21:46.582
I told you it wouldn't hurt

01:22:27.583 --> 01:22:28.707
She's still alive

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.624
You're the ones who injured my wife?

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.082
So what?

01:22:46.625 --> 01:22:47.707
By the looks of you two,

01:22:48.791 --> 01:22:50.374
it seems like it's hard to resolve this

01:22:50.916 --> 01:22:52.290
Can't you just let her go?

01:22:57.083 --> 01:22:58.707
Should I kill you first? Or her?

01:22:58.916 --> 01:22:59.957
It's hard to say

01:23:00.833 --> 01:23:01.999
who will die first

01:23:22.666 --> 01:23:23.624
You call that a sword?

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.915
I just need to sharpen it a bit

01:23:27.708 --> 01:23:29.332
Don't you think it's a bit too late?

01:23:30.666 --> 01:23:31.457
It's not late

01:23:32.166 --> 01:23:33.040
Not at all

01:23:39.291 --> 01:23:40.332
Don't waste your energy

01:23:42.125 --> 01:23:43.374
A needle in this accupoint. . .

01:23:43.583 --> 01:23:44.457
and then a second one...

01:23:45.208 --> 01:23:46.165
and then it won't hurt a bit when you die

01:23:46.375 --> 01:23:47.249
You haven't died

01:23:48.166 --> 01:23:49.749
How do you know if it hurts or not?

01:23:58.208 --> 01:24:01.165
Your needles are good for sneak attacks

01:24:04.875 --> 01:24:05.874
This house is so small,

01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:10.040
so using needles is not ideal

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.415
You don't recognize these two swords?

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:43.790
Impossible

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:45.624
We've already killed you

01:29:55.583 --> 01:29:56.540
These are urgent documents

01:29:56.708 --> 01:29:59.582
Get them to the courier on time

01:29:59.750 --> 01:30:02.624
or you will be blamed

01:30:02.791 --> 01:30:05.749
The senior eunuchs felt sorry for you

01:30:05.916 --> 01:30:08.290
So I kept you as a messenger

01:30:08.583 --> 01:30:12.082
If I hadn't, you'd have starved to death already

01:30:13.958 --> 01:30:16.499
Cao Feng, you wait here

01:30:20.541 --> 01:30:22.624
Here, wait here

01:30:23.041 --> 01:30:25.290
Good morning

01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:27.540
Good Morning Eunuch Tang

01:30:28.458 --> 01:30:29.749
It's late

01:30:30.250 --> 01:30:31.207
If it wasn't for Cao Feng,

01:30:31.541 --> 01:30:34.790
I'd have been here a long time ago

01:30:35.375 --> 01:30:38.374
I've been hoping to try Eunuch Zhang's special tea

01:30:50.458 --> 01:30:52.124
We are all envious of you

01:30:56.166 --> 01:31:00.832
Who would imagine that the Dark Stone's Wheel King

01:31:01.041 --> 01:31:03.457
is a low-ranking Palace eunuch?

01:31:03.666 --> 01:31:04.457
Who are you?

01:31:04.791 --> 01:31:05.624
Later tonight,

01:31:06.583 --> 01:31:08.499
I'll wait for you at the Yunhe Temple

01:31:09.666 --> 01:31:11.207
Why should I go to there?

01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:16.040
How did you find me?

01:31:19.083 --> 01:31:21.165
You killed Fatty Chen?

01:31:44.083 --> 01:31:45.499
How did you get the Pairing Sword?

01:31:45.708 --> 01:31:47.624
Cao Feng, let's go

01:31:47.833 --> 01:31:49.249
They are my swords

01:31:49.958 --> 01:31:50.332
Cao Feng

01:31:50.541 --> 01:31:51.915
You're Zhang Renfeng

01:31:52.333 --> 01:31:53.832
But do you know who your wife is?

01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:56.832
How ironic

01:31:57.041 --> 01:31:57.915
If you don't come,

01:31:58.375 --> 01:32:01.165
you'll never see Bodhi's remains again

01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:02.499
What did you say?

01:32:02.708 --> 01:32:03.957
Cao Feng, are you deaf?

01:32:04.375 --> 01:32:05.207
I told you to go, and you're still standing there

01:32:05.375 --> 01:32:08.290
I'll be waiting tonight at the Yunhe Temple

01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:09.207
You

01:32:09.375 --> 01:32:10.415
Cao Feng, you are brazen

01:32:10.625 --> 01:32:11.874
Pretending to be deaf...

01:32:52.666 --> 01:32:54.582
I've given her some medicine

01:32:56.625 --> 01:32:57.915
She's lost a lot of blood

01:32:58.708 --> 01:33:00.165
Let her rest for a while

01:33:06.416 --> 01:33:07.790
I have to go to the Yunhe Temple

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.040
If I don't come back,

01:33:12.250 --> 01:33:13.624
don't tell her who I am

01:33:14.083 --> 01:33:17.624
You don't think this is destiny?

01:33:19.625 --> 01:33:21.832
You haven't realized?

01:33:33.791 --> 01:33:35.457
You were only struck by a little sword energy

01:33:36.791 --> 01:33:38.540
Unclog your veins, and you'll be fine

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:40.957
There won't be a scar

01:33:42.916 --> 01:33:45.582
Did you withhold anything
when you taught me swordplay?

01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:51.540
I wouldn't treat you like that

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:55.832
You...

01:34:56.041 --> 01:34:56.915
I am

01:34:57.708 --> 01:34:58.874
You... You're a eunuch

01:34:59.083 --> 01:35:00.207
I am for now

01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:03.040
I've obtained Bodhi's remains

01:35:03.708 --> 01:35:04.707
In a few more days,

01:35:05.875 --> 01:35:09.915
I'll be a real man

01:35:10.125 --> 01:35:11.082
You're not a man

01:35:13.458 --> 01:35:14.915
I will be

01:35:16.125 --> 01:35:17.749
When Bodhi came to China

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.332
to live in the Palace,

01:35:20.541 --> 01:35:22.207
he would have been castrated

01:35:23.333 --> 01:35:24.540
But the remains show

01:35:24.958 --> 01:35:26.332
that Bodhi was not a eunuch,

01:35:26.541 --> 01:35:28.249
but a real man

01:35:29.208 --> 01:35:29.999
Why?

01:35:31.416 --> 01:35:33.874
This is Bodhi's secret kung fu

01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:36.832
I see

01:35:37.291 --> 01:35:39.457
From the intersections of the veins, I can follow

01:35:39.666 --> 01:35:42.124
the movement of Bodhi's internal energy

01:35:42.708 --> 01:35:44.540
The flow goes through

01:35:46.083 --> 01:35:50.582
the main meridians of his body

01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:52.124
He could regenerate organs

01:35:52.708 --> 01:35:55.290
even if they have been cut off

01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:00.499
I entered the palace when I was twelve

01:36:00.958 --> 01:36:02.332
After fifty years,

01:36:02.791 --> 01:36:05.249
I am just a eunuch of the ninth rank

01:36:05.958 --> 01:36:07.540
I hate eunuchs

01:36:08.416 --> 01:36:10.040
I hate the way I talk

01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:11.915
I hate that I can't grow a mustache

01:36:12.166 --> 01:36:13.290
I hate...

01:36:17.125 --> 01:36:20.707
I've had to hide my kung fu skills

01:36:22.916 --> 01:36:26.290
Once I understand the secret of Bodhi's remains

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.040
and restore myself, we can retire from this world

01:36:31.458 --> 01:36:33.499
We can live freely

01:36:34.166 --> 01:36:35.332
Just the two of us

01:36:40.625 --> 01:36:42.374
You really think it will grow back?

01:36:42.791 --> 01:36:44.915
We've all been fighting over the remains,

01:36:46.083 --> 01:36:47.707
and when we get them,
they turn out to be a big joke

01:36:53.291 --> 01:36:55.332
Do you know why I killed my first husband?

01:36:57.541 --> 01:36:58.832
Because he was just like you

01:36:59.666 --> 01:37:00.374
Impotent

01:37:03.041 --> 01:37:04.040
No, you're not impotent

01:37:04.833 --> 01:37:05.790
There's just nothing there

01:37:07.791 --> 01:37:08.790
This is what I am owed

01:37:09.250 --> 01:37:10.207
I am not taking any extra

01:37:17.666 --> 01:37:18.374
You

01:38:10.958 --> 01:38:14.374
Karma really is a bitch

01:38:17.625 --> 01:38:20.457
It's tough being a person

01:38:27.416 --> 01:38:30.124
You've died once before

01:38:30.666 --> 01:38:31.457
This time,

01:38:32.291 --> 01:38:37.540
it shouldn't be too difficult

01:39:04.166 --> 01:39:05.290
Your name is not Zeng Jing

01:39:08.708 --> 01:39:10.082
And my name is not Jiang Ah-Sheng

01:39:14.416 --> 01:39:16.540
My real name is Zhang Renfeng

01:39:18.916 --> 01:39:22.582
My father was Minister Zhang Haiduan

01:39:27.208 --> 01:39:29.207
My family is dead

01:39:39.291 --> 01:39:41.457
They were all killed by you and the Dark Stone

01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:22.124
Most people can't survive a chest wound like this,

01:40:23.250 --> 01:40:26.290
but your internal organs are reversed

01:40:27.291 --> 01:40:30.707
Most people's hearts are on the left,
but yours is on the right

01:40:31.291 --> 01:40:31.999
Doctor,

01:40:33.541 --> 01:40:35.082
can you give me a different face?

01:40:39.416 --> 01:40:42.499
Then Doctor Li performed the surgery

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.165
and told me

01:40:46.208 --> 01:40:49.290
that after your surgery you moved to Nanjing

01:40:50.250 --> 01:40:51.457
You want to rent a room?

01:40:51.708 --> 01:40:52.707
What is your name?

01:40:55.041 --> 01:40:57.249
My name is Jiang Ah-Sheng

01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.582
Thus I changed my name to Jiang Ah-Sheng

01:41:00.083 --> 01:41:02.832
and went to Nanjing looking for you

01:41:07.708 --> 01:41:09.540
I could have killed you any day

01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:12.540
However, in order to wipe out
the Dark Stone first,

01:41:13.541 --> 01:41:14.749
I have waited until now

01:41:18.083 --> 01:41:19.415
Turn around and look at me

01:41:31.291 --> 01:41:34.665
You know everything

01:41:43.458 --> 01:41:44.415
Ah-Sheng

01:41:45.916 --> 01:41:47.457
Before you kill me,

01:41:48.541 --> 01:41:49.874
I want to ask you something

01:41:51.875 --> 01:41:54.665
Did you ever love me?

01:41:58.791 --> 01:42:00.082
Not at all

01:42:04.250 --> 01:42:06.749
I have no feelings for you at all

01:42:11.291 --> 01:42:13.915
I don't care that you thought you killed me,

01:42:14.583 --> 01:42:16.040
but you killed my father

01:42:18.958 --> 01:42:21.832
There is no way I can forgive you

01:42:29.458 --> 01:42:30.290
Go

01:42:34.625 --> 01:42:38.624
If my father knew I killed a woman,

01:42:39.916 --> 01:42:42.874
he would never forgive me

01:42:47.625 --> 01:42:49.124
I don't ever want to see you again

01:42:51.333 --> 01:42:52.207
Just go

01:42:55.833 --> 01:42:56.832
Fine

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.624
Do you know why I am burying you under the bridge?

01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:39.665
I like you too much

01:43:40.375 --> 01:43:43.874
This way I can see you

01:43:44.041 --> 01:43:45.582
every time I cross the bridge

01:43:56.916 --> 01:43:59.832
Close your eyes. Good, close your eyes

01:44:00.041 --> 01:44:00.957
Everything will be finished soon

01:44:19.541 --> 01:44:20.707
Where do you think you're going?

01:44:21.375 --> 01:44:22.624
Come back. Come back

01:44:23.791 --> 01:44:24.749
Come back

01:44:25.625 --> 01:44:26.540
The two of us;

01:44:28.625 --> 01:44:29.582
we're not over yet

01:44:41.083 --> 01:44:42.082
May Buddha have mercy

01:44:43.208 --> 01:44:45.415
Please protect my husband Jiang Ah-Sheng

01:44:46.250 --> 01:44:47.582
and let him live a long life

01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.665
The 1 0th Yamma Palace

01:45:00.708 --> 01:45:05.665
The Wheel King lives alone in the 1 0th Palace,

01:45:06.375 --> 01:45:08.624
putting souls on trial

01:45:09.708 --> 01:45:11.874
and determining life spans

01:45:12.791 --> 01:45:15.165
Dividing the rich and the poor,

01:45:16.041 --> 01:45:18.290
and sending out souls for reincarnation

01:45:57.833 --> 01:45:59.540
Before Wisdom died, he told me

01:46:01.291 --> 01:46:03.999
the reason Bodhi's remains are so renowned

01:46:04.166 --> 01:46:06.082
is because of his high level
of spiritual cultivation

01:46:08.333 --> 01:46:10.832
Your heart overflows with violence

01:46:11.250 --> 01:46:13.332
Even if you learn how he moved his energy,

01:46:14.625 --> 01:46:15.665
what is the use?

01:46:16.458 --> 01:46:17.832
In this life,

01:46:19.041 --> 01:46:21.040
you will always be a eunuch

01:46:37.541 --> 01:46:39.165
You can start over

01:46:40.208 --> 01:46:41.499
Why not me?

01:46:42.625 --> 01:46:44.790
I just want to be a real man

01:46:46.458 --> 01:46:47.790
Is that too much to ask?

01:48:03.916 --> 01:48:05.165
I'm the one. . .

01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:07.290
who taught you the Water-Shedding Sword maneuver

01:48:11.708 --> 01:48:13.124
But you didn't master it,

01:48:14.375 --> 01:48:15.749
and there are four errors in your technique

01:48:15.958 --> 01:48:17.457
Today, I'll teach you again

01:48:17.875 --> 01:48:19.957
There are 4 sword strokes
that you haven't mastered

01:48:24.166 --> 01:48:27.374
I worry that one day you'll meet a real master

01:48:27.583 --> 01:48:29.457
These four moves can beat your Water-Shedding sword
if you don't master them

01:48:30.875 --> 01:48:32.082
You will certainly be killed

01:48:38.625 --> 01:48:42.290
Let me reap the consequences of karma

01:48:57.333 --> 01:48:58.790
Hide weakness in deftness

01:49:00.250 --> 01:49:01.457
Hide weakness in deftness.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.249
Use both darkness and light

01:49:48.708 --> 01:49:51.874
Reveal clarity in obscurity

01:50:10.833 --> 01:50:11.749
In surrender become strong

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.332
How did you suddenly strike me eleven times?

01:52:36.416 --> 01:52:38.540
I would willingly turn into a bridge

01:52:41.958 --> 01:52:45.290
for 500 years and endure the wind,

01:52:46.333 --> 01:52:47.332
the sun,

01:52:48.916 --> 01:52:49.957
and the rain

01:52:50.875 --> 01:52:51.749
Ah-Sheng,

01:52:52.791 --> 01:52:54.457
this is tortoise powder

01:52:55.583 --> 01:52:56.707
Within a few hours,

01:52:57.250 --> 01:52:58.874
your heart and breath will stop,
and you will appear to be dead

01:53:01.083 --> 01:53:03.790
When the Wheel King sees you,
he will think you're dead

01:53:04.125 --> 01:53:07.290
I will make sure your father's death is avenged

01:53:08.916 --> 01:53:11.040
I changed all of my money into gold

01:53:11.958 --> 01:53:13.249
and paved it on the floor of our house

01:53:16.250 --> 01:53:17.749
After I die,

01:53:18.416 --> 01:53:21.915
take the money and leave the Capital

01:53:22.708 --> 01:53:26.249
Get married and raise a family

01:53:31.916 --> 01:53:34.457
Your heart will not stop beating

01:55:09.791 --> 01:55:10.457
Come on,

01:55:12.041 --> 01:55:13.582
let's go home

01:55:15.833 --> 01:55:21.207
After we get home, draw up the divorce papers

01:55:25.166 --> 01:55:26.499
Don't be silly

01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:30.124
We have years ahead of us
