WEBVTT

00:28.112 --> 00:29.697
Thank you.

00:32.158 --> 00:33.367
Mmm.

00:36.871 --> 00:37.997
Come on.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.040
What?

00:40.124 --> 00:42.626
This is you.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.671
Oh...

00:47.757 --> 00:50.551
Mmm. Mmm!

00:50.634 --> 00:54.430
Mmm. Ah... water.

00:54.513 --> 00:56.015
So quenching.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.142
That was pretty good.

00:58.225 --> 01:01.145
- I was shooting
an ad for this ax.
- Mm-hmm.

01:01.228 --> 01:03.314
It was, like, a whole campaign
to make wood sexy.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.065
But you just ruined it.

01:45.397 --> 01:47.316
Once again, my apologies.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.401
I thought we were actually
gonna take a schvitz.

01:49.485 --> 01:52.321
I wish I could, man.
I-I need to relax.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.782
Everything is just...

01:54.865 --> 01:57.868
not good and...

01:57.952 --> 02:00.120
- I need to accept that
she's gone.
- Yeah.

02:00.204 --> 02:03.415
- Yeah.
- Your life is 100% fubar.

02:03.499 --> 02:06.043
Nora's gone,
your murderer is on the loose,

02:06.126 --> 02:08.546
and if they ever find out
that you got your memories back,

02:08.629 --> 02:10.047
they're gonna come
after you again.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.675
Meanwhile, you're trapped
living with Ingrid,

02:12.758 --> 02:14.051
who is...

02:16.262 --> 02:17.263
No comment.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.639
Ingrid's not so bad.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.560
It helps to pretend it's only
a play about your life,

02:22.643 --> 02:23.686
and she's the star.

02:23.769 --> 02:25.521
Wasn't she in on the plot
to have you killed?

02:25.604 --> 02:27.898
She barely knew anything.
It was like 96% her dad.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.108
Dude.

02:29.191 --> 02:30.860
Whatever. I'm flawed, too.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.361
Okay, I sold my code
behind my partner's back.

02:32.444 --> 02:33.904
That's why this is all
happening.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.573
You are not seriously
blaming yourself

02:35.656 --> 02:37.032
for your own murder?

02:37.116 --> 02:38.742
No, no.

02:38.826 --> 02:42.079
Okay, it's just Ingrid and I,

02:42.162 --> 02:43.914
I don't know, maybe
we deserve each other.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.043
You know, I did love her once.

02:48.127 --> 02:49.628
And she's on my side.

02:51.422 --> 02:53.007
She uploaded for me.

02:55.050 --> 02:58.095
Well, give it the old
college try.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.973
I mean, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this, but

03:01.056 --> 03:02.433
if she's anything like
her grandmother,

03:02.516 --> 03:04.476
she's a freaky fun ride.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.562
Wow.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.981
I know I've asked you this
before:

03:09.064 --> 03:10.357
what's wrong with you?

03:10.441 --> 03:13.694
Everything, man.

03:13.777 --> 03:16.655
Just everything.

03:16.739 --> 03:21.368
Tribal taupe, cheddar satin,

03:21.452 --> 03:24.330
and Miami hotel.

03:24.413 --> 03:27.124
- What do we think?
- These are all the options?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.667
Okay.

03:28.751 --> 03:31.045
Let me see them all again.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.589
Of course.
Eighth time's a charm.

03:33.672 --> 03:37.927
Fuck.

03:42.306 --> 03:45.601
Uh, what's going on here, babe?

03:45.684 --> 03:47.686
We're throwing a dinner party.
Ooh!

03:47.770 --> 03:49.229
Now, I know they're
not really your thing,

03:49.313 --> 03:52.483
but just listen to
my arguments, okay?

03:52.566 --> 03:55.486
Number one, it's an opportunity
for us to look hot together

03:55.569 --> 03:57.488
- in front of lots of other
less-hot people.
- Mm-hmm.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.698
- Two, I think this...
- I'm in.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.534
- Wow. Really?
- Mm-hmm.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.036
I-I had, like, 40 more of those.

04:04.119 --> 04:05.788
I was planning on
wearing you down.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.206
Nope, nope, nope.

04:07.289 --> 04:09.416
I'm in. My girl wants
a dinner party,

04:09.500 --> 04:12.252
my girl gets a dinner party.
Who's coming?

04:12.336 --> 04:14.254
Well, David Choak, for one.

04:14.338 --> 04:15.923
I figure we live
across the hall

04:16.006 --> 04:18.550
from a billionaire; we may
as well take advantage.

04:18.634 --> 04:21.345
For sure, for sure.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.973
It's just he's so gross, babe.

04:24.056 --> 04:27.101
- Because he has
an age-accurate avatar?
- No.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.061
Just imagine how cool
he would be with his money

04:29.144 --> 04:31.480
if he decided to look like
a young Tom Cruise.

04:31.563 --> 04:32.982
You know I'm four inches
taller than Tom Cruise?

04:33.065 --> 04:34.233
Yes, you've told me before.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.735
Well, it's very important to me.
Who else is coming?

04:36.819 --> 04:39.405
Um, some friends I made
in line at the complaints desk.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.365
Very discriminating people.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.535
Well, they sound great.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.286
Can I invite some friends, too?

04:46.370 --> 04:48.330
Sure, just not...

04:48.414 --> 04:49.707
- Luke.
- Ugh.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.500
You know he should be in jail

04:51.583 --> 04:52.960
for what he's doing
to my grandmother.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.336
They're dating.

04:54.420 --> 04:57.006
Mm, it still should be illegal.

04:57.089 --> 04:59.425
Actually, fine.

04:59.508 --> 05:01.260
Maybe Mr. Choak will fall
for Granny.

05:01.343 --> 05:02.803
And my friend Yang.
She's cool.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.680
- Yang?
- Yeah. From 2Gig.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.890
Yay. So that means

05:06.974 --> 05:08.642
we're gonna need
more place settings.

05:08.726 --> 05:10.185
Okay, I'll go invite them,

05:10.269 --> 05:12.813
get Yang a day pass.
It's gonna be great.

05:12.896 --> 05:16.942
Whatever happens, this is
gonna be, uh, awesome.

05:17.026 --> 05:18.736
Okay. Bye, Boo-Boo.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.404
- Mm.

05:20.487 --> 05:21.697
He took that quite well.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.032
Yes.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.701
And you'll be using standard
AI catering?

05:25.784 --> 05:29.288
Um, are there
any other options?

05:29.371 --> 05:32.458
You can have live angels
serving, for an upcharge.

05:32.541 --> 05:35.586
Ma'am, I will try my best
to do a good job.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.505
Okay, "good job"
won't be enough.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.842
This party better be
fucking flawless.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.011
Don't you worry, it will be.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.264
Greatest party ever!
Greatest party ever!

05:51.435 --> 05:55.147
Okay, give me two angels
on standby, please.

05:56.774 --> 06:01.153
Uploads live a life
of comfort. Luxury.

06:01.236 --> 06:03.405
Leisure.
But what do they lack?

06:03.489 --> 06:04.865
Manners.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.701
Something that makes death
worth living.

06:07.785 --> 06:11.914
So we've created Proto-Tykes
by Horizen.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.875
- Oh, uh...

06:14.958 --> 06:16.627
This is just the baseline face.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.920
But the more you spend...

06:20.839 --> 06:22.549
- ...we will always
offer our uploads.

06:22.633 --> 06:25.719
Ugh. Yes, what is it?
I'm in a meeting.

06:25.803 --> 06:28.764
Ingrid Kannerman in 10556 wants
a couple angels on standby

06:28.847 --> 06:30.349
for cater-waiter this evening.

06:30.432 --> 06:31.475
Yes. Fine.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.186
- Go away.
- Oh, yeah.

06:34.269 --> 06:36.730
The next level baby
merges the faces

06:36.814 --> 06:38.065
of two parents.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.484
- Hey, how's the new temp?
- Uh, clueless.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.862
- But eager,
and motivated by food.
- Hmm.

06:43.946 --> 06:46.073
I think I might get her
a clicker trainer,

06:46.156 --> 06:48.075
like the one you get for dogs.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.243
Oh, you should.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.662
Does the new temp have
her own avatar?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.330
She hasn't been
on the system yet.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.791
Give her an old one,
'cause I need you two on standby

06:55.874 --> 06:59.419
for an important client.

07:17.521 --> 07:20.274
- Nora, did you make this dip?
- Yeah.

07:20.357 --> 07:23.402
My mom's recipe.
Careful, it's spicy.

07:31.076 --> 07:34.580
It's good. It's not so bad.

07:34.663 --> 07:37.040
What's the secret ingredient?

07:37.124 --> 07:39.084
Is it fire?

07:45.465 --> 07:46.508
Needs more chiles.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.182
That was
a good one, Dad.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.142
Mmm.

07:56.977 --> 08:01.398
Dave, tell your daughter that
it's not all fun and games here.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.109
People are sacrificing
while she's eating chips and dip

08:04.193 --> 08:05.569
and playing grab-ass.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.821
- Hey, look, Pastor...
- I work in the garden.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.364
These people stuck
their necks out

08:09.448 --> 08:10.449
for you, Nora Antony.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.743
How will you return the favor?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.912
I'm sure she'll find
a way to pull her weight.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.705
I'm sure of it.

08:24.713 --> 08:27.424
- It's gonna be great.
- Okay.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.760
Welcome.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.803
Mr. Choak. Oh, uh,

08:31.887 --> 08:33.680
I didn't know you were
bringing a guest.

08:33.764 --> 08:36.099
She's a Prefera.
She's not a person.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.602
Programmed to look like
my ex-wife, but, uh,

08:38.685 --> 08:41.021
make an effort to learn
my preferences.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.232
I pay attention to what
Mr. Choak likes,

08:43.315 --> 08:45.400
and give it to him forever.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.612
How, um, lovely.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.822
- Would you like a drink?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.992
Mr. Choak likes Bloody Marys

08:54.076 --> 08:55.535
and the rollback
of environmental laws.

08:56.578 --> 08:59.665
Well, we can handle
one of those.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.751
For you, sir.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.087
And champagne for
the lovely sex doll.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.922
- Okay...

09:07.005 --> 09:10.425
Mm. Gotta make rent, right?

09:10.509 --> 09:13.178
What he uses her for
in the privacy of his own suite

09:13.262 --> 09:14.680
is none of our concern.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.014
I'm just trying
to be friendly, ma'am.

09:16.098 --> 09:18.016
Get out of my sight.

09:18.100 --> 09:21.019
Right away.

09:21.103 --> 09:23.355
Whoa...

09:23.438 --> 09:25.148
- Ha ha!
- What up, bro?

09:25.232 --> 09:26.984
- What's up?
- What up, AI Guy?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.694
- He's not here.
- I'm not here.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.571
Um, is this a-a keg?

09:31.655 --> 09:33.865
Be rude to arrive empty-handed.

09:33.949 --> 09:35.909
Okay, let me just...

09:35.993 --> 09:38.537
Luke, you shouldn't have.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.872
Excuse me.

09:40.956 --> 09:42.833
I feel like she meant that.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.960
A keg. So generous.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.004
I know, right?

09:49.881 --> 09:51.049
Nathaniel.

09:51.133 --> 09:53.760
Mil-Mildred.

09:53.844 --> 09:55.887
- She's drunk.
- Great.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.943
Good luck today.

10:13.322 --> 10:17.284
Little Xerox, I'm gonna need
a pizza in real life.

10:17.367 --> 10:21.079
I-I mean a-a pizza,
extra cheese cartridge,

10:21.163 --> 10:23.415
half-inch margins.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.542
Okay.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.839
Could you get me
a dirty martini?

10:30.922 --> 10:33.008
I don't work here.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.426
Hello.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.136
Welcome, friends.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.513
Thank you so much for coming

10:38.597 --> 10:40.515
to our little luxury suite.

10:40.599 --> 10:43.977
Luxury, and yet there are
no hors d'oeuvres.

10:44.061 --> 10:47.022
Feed them ASAP.

10:47.105 --> 10:48.815
Yes, ma'am.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.529
No. No, no, not like that.

10:54.613 --> 10:55.572
Make it classy.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.199
Sorry. Do over.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.243
Oh, wow.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.746
I'm, I'm sure they're,
they're still fine.

11:02.829 --> 11:06.500
We... Oh, no, that is
so damp.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.835
Maybe we'll just put these
in a little to-go box for Yang.

11:08.919 --> 11:10.462
- What do you think?
- Thanks.

11:10.545 --> 11:13.882
Okay, everyone, please.
Let's all sit, all right?

11:13.965 --> 11:15.884
- Yikes.
- Boo-Boo?

11:24.559 --> 11:28.522
Mr. Choak, this is
my grandmother Mildred.

11:28.605 --> 11:29.815
You probably have
a lot in common.

11:29.898 --> 11:33.193
Oh, are you a child
of the '50s, like me?

11:33.276 --> 11:35.028
Howdy Doody on the TV?

11:35.112 --> 11:36.488
Actually, the '30s.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.532
Amos 'n' Andy on the radio.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.659
I remember
Amos 'n' Andy.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.953
They were very racist,
as I recall.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.037
Mm-hmm.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.915
Oh, things aren't
as funny today, are they?

11:46.998 --> 11:48.500
Well, those things aren't.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.211
Thanks, babe.
Everyone...

11:51.294 --> 11:54.548
for the first course,
they've programmed

11:54.631 --> 11:57.884
- a delightful seafood bisque.
- Mmm.

11:57.968 --> 11:59.428
I hope you like it.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.555
Mr. Choak prefers
to eat intelligent

12:01.638 --> 12:04.391
- or endangered species.
- Really?

12:04.474 --> 12:07.436
Well, it's socially acceptable
to eat octopus,

12:07.519 --> 12:09.646
and they're more intelligent
than a six-year-old child.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.024
But you don't eat kids, right?

12:14.359 --> 12:15.610
Nobody eats kids.

12:15.694 --> 12:18.405
No, but I'm just saying
it's a contradiction.

12:18.488 --> 12:21.366
We don't eat kids,
but we eat octopus

12:21.450 --> 12:23.452
or dolphin or gorilla.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.287
Do we, though?

12:25.370 --> 12:27.122
Okay, so who wants to tell us

12:27.205 --> 12:29.499
their favorite part
of the Update now?

12:29.583 --> 12:30.625
Oh, I'll go. Can I go?

12:30.709 --> 12:31.626
- Yes, please.
- I can go?

12:31.710 --> 12:32.752
Okay. You know that feeling

12:32.836 --> 12:34.171
when you try to crack
your knuckle,

12:34.254 --> 12:36.089
and it's straining,
and you're not sure

12:36.173 --> 12:37.132
if the knuckle's gonna pop,

12:37.215 --> 12:38.425
but then it does in, like,

12:38.508 --> 12:40.969
a really satisfying way?

12:41.052 --> 12:42.846
It's 25 cents, and it's just,

12:42.929 --> 12:44.347
it's so worth it.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.599
This, uh, this bisque...

12:45.682 --> 12:47.684
I think they forgot
to program the scent.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.394
Oh, my God.

12:49.478 --> 12:53.106
Make the smell of the food
more enticing.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.817
Okay, I will try,
but I just want you to know,

12:55.901 --> 12:58.236
AI system's still practicing
sense of smell.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.654
- We're not great...
- I don't care.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.823
- Smells up.
- Okay. Ba-ba-ba.

13:01.907 --> 13:03.325
Oh.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.996
Wow. That is fishy.

13:08.079 --> 13:12.709
In-in a, in a... it's actually
in a really nice way. Wow.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.336
Like low tide in Nantucket.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.129
Yeah.

13:16.213 --> 13:19.799
That's it.
You're fired.

13:19.883 --> 13:22.135
All of you, now, out.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.806
Go! Go, go, go, go, go.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.233
Everyone, crack your knuckles.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.943
It's on us. Please.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.736
- Babe...

13:39.819 --> 13:41.696
- Sorry.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.824
Oh, my God.
It's so cute.

13:49.579 --> 13:50.664
Shit.

13:52.874 --> 13:55.502
Yo, Leeshy, time to
send in the varsity team.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.921
Does your avatar have
any party clothes?

13:58.004 --> 14:01.383
- My avatar is
a fucking knockout.
- Great.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.344
Okay... Ooh, we got
Berlin nightclub,

14:04.427 --> 14:05.762
Cairo disco.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.305
Drinks on a boat?

14:10.225 --> 14:13.270
- Or maid in an old movie.
- How about you?

14:13.353 --> 14:14.896
You ready to roll?

14:14.980 --> 14:17.274
- Uh, this is my second day.
- Uh-huh.

14:17.357 --> 14:21.236
Still not exactly sure what
it is that we do here, but...

14:23.655 --> 14:25.156
So, so...

14:25.240 --> 14:28.201
...current events.

14:28.285 --> 14:31.621
You know, anybody got a hot take
on the upcoming election or...

14:31.705 --> 14:33.665
Ugh, I stopped caring
about that stuff

14:33.748 --> 14:34.958
after I uploaded.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.960
I mean, what's even the point?
We can't vote.

14:37.043 --> 14:40.755
Good. Yes. Nothing good
ever came from voting.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.466
Women got the right to vote,
and ten years later, blammo!

14:43.550 --> 14:45.302
The Great Depression.

14:46.511 --> 14:49.264
Nathan, I'm curious
to know your thoughts

14:49.347 --> 14:52.350
about the recent attack
on Freeyond.

14:52.434 --> 14:54.102
Um, actually, I wasn't aware.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.062
The Ludds
are out of control.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.689
You knew about that?

14:57.772 --> 15:01.610
Yeah. I like to
stay informed, babe.

15:01.693 --> 15:05.405
The Ludds scare me.
That Pastor Rob.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.365
They hate our kind
and are capable of anything.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.159
Pastor Rob is a hypocrite.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.910
My dad played racquetball
with him

15:10.994 --> 15:12.954
a few years ago,
before he went off the grid,

15:13.038 --> 15:15.123
and he always cheated.

15:15.206 --> 15:18.585
Freeyond sounded good to me.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.045
Ha!

15:20.128 --> 15:22.172
I'd never upload to Freeyond.

15:22.255 --> 15:26.051
There have to be winners
and losers in life.

15:26.134 --> 15:28.845
If Yang didn't exist,
how would I know

15:28.928 --> 15:30.847
how good my life is?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.891
That's why she's here, right?

15:32.974 --> 15:34.351
Wait, what?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.436
That's ridiculous. We're
talking about human beings.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.146
Mm...

15:38.229 --> 15:39.856
Yeah,
I agree with Nathan.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.484
Freeyond's a good idea.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.444
I mean, why not let
everyone have a shot?

15:44.527 --> 15:46.321
Give the poor people
even a smidgen

15:46.404 --> 15:48.031
of what we enjoy here.

15:48.114 --> 15:51.117
A reward to those who
toil their whole lives.

15:51.201 --> 15:54.954
Freeyond has a kind of
pioneer spirit that I admire.

15:55.038 --> 15:58.208
People building
their own afterlives.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.418
Yes. Exactly, Mr. Choak.

16:00.502 --> 16:01.670
Yeah. You see, babe?

16:01.753 --> 16:04.255
Nathan, didn't you tell me
that you, uh,

16:04.339 --> 16:06.966
you worked on a, on a project
similar to Freeyond?

16:07.050 --> 16:08.468
Oh, uh, funny story...

16:08.551 --> 16:11.513
- Uh, project? This guy?
- Yeah.

16:11.596 --> 16:13.139
No, he's never talked
about that, ever.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.266
Right, right.
Honestly, everybody,

16:15.350 --> 16:18.228
Nathan barely remembers
anything from his past.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.648
His-his memories were
pretty damaged when he uploaded.

16:21.731 --> 16:22.941
Yeah, yeah, you know,

16:23.024 --> 16:25.110
sometimes I can't even
remember my own name.

16:25.193 --> 16:27.696
- It's Nathan Brown.
- Oh...

16:27.779 --> 16:29.197
Thank you.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.493
Oh, my.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.453
Chicken nuggets.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.414
Yeah. Ingrid said we could
order whatever we wanted.

16:37.497 --> 16:40.792
- You're a child.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.669
Hey.

16:42.752 --> 16:45.505
You look spicy in that bow tie.

16:45.588 --> 16:49.175
I mean it.
It's an inside joke.

16:49.259 --> 16:51.302
Oh... how many of these
you think I can fit in my mouth?

16:51.386 --> 16:52.804
Could you use a fork?

16:52.887 --> 16:55.306
Bitch three's low on water,
and I need more bread.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.475
Okay, um...

16:57.559 --> 16:59.978
water.

17:01.229 --> 17:04.858
So, Yang,
how does it work with 2Gig?

17:04.941 --> 17:07.068
They pay you to test things out
for us or, or what?

17:07.152 --> 17:09.904
Actually, we have to pay,

17:09.988 --> 17:12.407
and it's quite a lot
for most of us.

17:12.490 --> 17:15.827
Oh, shit.

17:20.957 --> 17:23.418
Where are you taking me?

17:23.501 --> 17:26.045
It's a surprise.

17:26.129 --> 17:27.714
Well, watch out it's not
anything fun,

17:27.797 --> 17:30.175
or Pastor Rob will
put me in the stocks.

17:30.258 --> 17:31.342
Don't worry about him.

17:31.426 --> 17:33.011
Okay? He and his followers

17:33.094 --> 17:36.139
are just a loud minority.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.352
Hmm.

17:41.436 --> 17:44.355
Well, this is... private.

17:44.439 --> 17:45.690
Close your eyes.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.026
What is it?

17:48.109 --> 17:49.486
I'll give you a hint.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.362
Okay.

17:51.446 --> 17:55.283
It's somebody
from your old life,

17:55.366 --> 17:58.328
who you probably miss a lot.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.913
Uh-huh.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.833
Okay, open 'em.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.420
Hi.

18:07.504 --> 18:09.297
AI Guy?

18:09.380 --> 18:12.050
No, not AI Guy.
My name is Boris.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.051
Boris Netherlands.

18:13.134 --> 18:14.677
That is my name.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.222
Wait, I'm s-sorry, but--
and not to be rude--

18:17.305 --> 18:19.432
who the fuck is
Boris Netherlands?

18:19.516 --> 18:21.518
- He's an unemployed actor.
- You could just say "actor."

18:21.601 --> 18:24.479
- Sorry, sorry.
- I was paid $1,200 total

18:24.562 --> 18:27.816
to use my face and likeness
forever. 1,200 bucks.

18:27.899 --> 18:31.277
- And I recruited him
to the Ludds.
- Yes.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.279
It's just so weird

18:33.363 --> 18:36.199
to see him sit and be.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.744
Normally he's just so, like...

18:43.873 --> 18:45.500
Oh, ha ha!
Yeah, it's not my only work.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.961
My face was also the face
of Manana Bread.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.088
I don't know...

18:50.171 --> 18:51.965
It's banana bread for men.

18:52.048 --> 18:55.218
It was considered problematic.
They took it off the shelves.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.428
So we're gonna LIDAR him
and make an avatar I can use

18:57.512 --> 18:59.848
to sneak into Lakeview
from the Grey Zone.

18:59.931 --> 19:01.641
It's smart, right?

19:01.724 --> 19:04.310
No one's gonna notice
an extra one of this guy.

19:04.394 --> 19:07.105
Well, what do the Ludds want
with Lakeview?

19:09.065 --> 19:10.567
Over here.

19:10.650 --> 19:14.070
Pastor Rob and his wing
hate all upload, right?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.822
The rest of us hate upload
for the rich.

19:15.905 --> 19:19.242
Fucking with Lakeview is...
it's very unifying.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.411
- Look, I don't know.
- They taught you design, right?

19:21.494 --> 19:23.496
Well, yeah.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.832
So maybe you could
help us out with this.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.334
You were looking for a way
to earn your spot, right?

19:30.503 --> 19:31.880
We have to keep an eye on them.

19:31.963 --> 19:34.632
Just to see what's
going on up there.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.347
- All right, I guess.
- Yeah?

19:41.431 --> 19:46.686
I mean, not to brag or anything,
but it's kind of my specialty.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.521
Okay. Okay.

19:48.605 --> 19:49.814
Cullyn.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.274
That's mine, by the way.

19:52.317 --> 19:55.153
You ready? One, two, three.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.532
All right, Boris, hop in.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.701
You guys got a theater troupe?

20:01.784 --> 20:03.703
No.

20:03.786 --> 20:04.704
Do you want one?

20:04.787 --> 20:06.956
We're all set.

20:10.084 --> 20:11.628
We could do...
Did you like Waitress?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.212
Don't move.

20:21.346 --> 20:24.349
- Um, please don't linger.
- S-S-Sorry.

20:24.432 --> 20:25.767
She's just doing
her job, Ingrid.

20:32.190 --> 20:33.191
Oops.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.281
Yeah, I'll help you get that.

20:42.784 --> 20:45.328
What are you doing here?

20:45.411 --> 20:47.580
Uh, picking up the fork
that you dropped.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.207
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

20:49.290 --> 20:52.001
Did you need me? 'Cause
I've just been at my desk.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.586
What are you talking about?
That doesn't make any sense.

20:53.670 --> 20:54.587
Aleesha said you were missing.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.005
Shit!

20:56.089 --> 20:59.008
I was so worried about you.

20:59.092 --> 21:02.053
Please just let me
do my job, okay?

21:02.136 --> 21:04.973
- What? Nora. Nora.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.475
Shit.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.937
Ah. Oh. Oh!

21:11.020 --> 21:13.398
Oh, oh, oh, that's
where we know you from.

21:13.481 --> 21:14.607
You're the girl
that came out to L.A.

21:14.691 --> 21:15.775
to check up on us.

21:15.858 --> 21:18.653
That's right.
That was very kind of you.

21:18.736 --> 21:21.030
Oh, no.
Oh, no, I'm-I'm actually not.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.991
- Um...
- Oh, oh, mm, ah.

21:23.074 --> 21:24.200
I don't need to hear
your life story.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.118
Let her finish.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.955
We shouldn't silence women.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.879
I'm-I'm not her.

21:36.963 --> 21:40.883
I'm, uh... just a temp...

21:40.967 --> 21:42.301
using her avatar.

21:43.928 --> 21:45.638
How interesting.
Would you by chance

21:45.722 --> 21:47.932
happen to know where
that angel might be?

21:48.016 --> 21:49.183
Why does it matter?

21:49.267 --> 21:50.685
It mattered to me.

21:50.768 --> 21:53.438
You know, I-I, uh...
I liked her.

21:54.647 --> 21:58.109
She was really good at her job.

21:58.192 --> 22:00.653
They sent me a temp?

22:00.737 --> 22:02.196
I'm so sorry.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.157
Hmm.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.463
What?

22:21.007 --> 22:23.301
You've got a flair for this.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.013
Yeah, I always liked
this part of the job.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.015
♪ There's only you...

22:29.098 --> 22:31.267
Why are you so anti-tech?

22:32.894 --> 22:36.731
Not tech, just tech that
makes inequality worse.

22:36.814 --> 22:38.733
Like, why should you have
to make rent

22:38.816 --> 22:41.569
catering to a bunch
of rich old pigs?

22:41.652 --> 22:43.362
It wasn't all bad.

22:43.446 --> 22:45.406
I mean, there's
something satisfying

22:45.490 --> 22:49.077
about bringing a dead person
back to life.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.871
Oh, how Frankenstein of you.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.915
I "vant" to suck your blood.

22:55.249 --> 22:57.335
That's Dracula.

22:57.418 --> 22:59.796
- Just let me concentrate,
please.
- Mm.

23:04.050 --> 23:07.720
So, I've had some beers
and some time.

23:07.804 --> 23:09.972
I'm connecting the dots.

23:10.056 --> 23:14.268
Do you think Kannerman's partner
could be... the Ludds?

23:14.352 --> 23:15.728
Hmm?

23:15.812 --> 23:17.814
Didn't you hear Ingrid?

23:17.897 --> 23:20.525
Her dad used to play racquetball
with Pastor Rob.

23:20.608 --> 23:23.277
He's the numero uno
head Ludd honcho.

23:23.361 --> 23:25.780
She carries herself
differently.

23:25.863 --> 23:29.325
You know, like, not graceful.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.952
Right.

23:34.288 --> 23:37.708
Oh. Mm.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.342
Are you gonna finish that?

23:46.425 --> 23:50.096
- You go, girl.
- Thanks.

23:50.179 --> 23:53.266
Ingrid, the food was exquisite.

23:53.349 --> 23:54.600
Thank you.

23:54.684 --> 23:58.980
I'm so glad everyone
is full and happy... Oh.

23:59.063 --> 24:02.483
Um, excuse me,
I just need to go and...

24:02.567 --> 24:04.026
wash my hands.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.529
I never wash my hands.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.865
Ever.

24:08.948 --> 24:09.949
- Oh.

24:12.535 --> 24:14.537
Coming.

24:22.837 --> 24:25.298
Thanks.
Oh, my God.

24:28.509 --> 24:30.887
- Fuck!
- No tip?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.306
What were the $15

24:33.389 --> 24:36.684
in service fees for?

24:43.566 --> 24:46.235
Hey.

24:46.319 --> 24:49.947
Thanks for standing up
for me back there.

24:50.031 --> 24:53.117
That was way dope.

24:53.201 --> 24:55.703
Way dope.

24:55.786 --> 24:58.122
You don't sound
anything like her.

24:58.206 --> 25:00.541
I'm sorry, I...

25:00.625 --> 25:03.044
I don't know how
I'm supposed to sound.

25:03.127 --> 25:05.713
Why are you using
her avatar?

25:05.796 --> 25:08.966
It's, it's just
really fucked-up.

25:09.050 --> 25:12.595
I'm just doing my job.

25:26.275 --> 25:27.735
Done.

25:31.906 --> 25:33.449
Awesome.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.576
♪ Doing something...

25:35.660 --> 25:38.204
It was nice to feel useful...

25:38.287 --> 25:41.958
to the, you know...

25:42.041 --> 25:43.292
cause.

25:43.376 --> 25:45.920
Yeah.

26:22.665 --> 26:25.418
Luke. Wow.

26:25.501 --> 26:28.379
- Just thank you so much
for coming.
- Mm-hmm.

26:28.462 --> 26:31.841
My pleasure, Ingrid.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.718
- Oh.
- Okay.

26:33.801 --> 26:35.553
Whoa. Get a room, you two.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.555
Come here.

26:37.638 --> 26:40.182
Thanks for having me, man.
I really appreciate it.

26:40.266 --> 26:43.894
Always so great to hang out.

26:43.978 --> 26:47.523
Hey, uh, not huge,
but you, uh, you might want

26:47.606 --> 26:49.275
to apologize to that server.

26:49.358 --> 26:51.902
She's not AI.
She's got feelings.

26:53.696 --> 26:55.531
All right, Millie, come on.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.159
- Let's get drunk
and fool around.
- Coming.

26:59.702 --> 27:03.039
And I will see you later.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.999
- Mm, no.
- Mm-hmm.

27:05.082 --> 27:07.626
Yes.

27:07.710 --> 27:10.921
It was awesome meeting you.
Thanks for tonight.

27:11.005 --> 27:11.922
Thank you.

27:12.006 --> 27:13.591
Later, Yang.

27:13.674 --> 27:15.343
Thanks for the day pass.

27:15.426 --> 27:17.261
You know?
If it's for the movement,

27:17.345 --> 27:18.888
- I mean, we have no choice.
- You sure?

27:23.225 --> 27:24.602
What?

27:24.685 --> 27:25.644
People were really impressed

27:25.728 --> 27:26.979
by the job you did
on the avatar.

27:27.063 --> 27:30.858
Good. So we're all cool here?

27:30.941 --> 27:35.488
So impressed that we want you
to go back to Horizen

27:35.571 --> 27:38.074
as an undercover agent.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.409
What?

27:40.493 --> 27:41.577
Who's "we"?

27:41.660 --> 27:43.204
The leadership.

27:43.287 --> 27:44.955
We talked and we all agreed

27:45.039 --> 27:47.375
you'd be... you'd be
a huge asset, Nora.

27:47.458 --> 27:50.294
Is that what you want?

27:50.378 --> 27:51.796
For me to go home?

27:51.879 --> 27:56.509
No, but, uh...
what I want is irrelevant.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.636
It's what's best
for the movement.

27:58.719 --> 28:01.514
Oh.

28:01.597 --> 28:03.724
Uh-huh.

28:03.808 --> 28:07.144
Okay, the last time
I was in New York,

28:07.228 --> 28:08.521
people tried to kill me.

28:08.604 --> 28:11.524
That's true,
but this time you'll be safe.

28:11.607 --> 28:13.109
We can protect you.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.277
New burner phone,
new ISP number,

28:15.361 --> 28:17.279
untraceable place to live,
but look, look.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.281
You'll be working closely
with one of our best agents

28:19.365 --> 28:21.325
in the field... Agent Cheetoh.

28:21.409 --> 28:23.452
Chee-Cheetah?

28:23.536 --> 28:26.038
Cheetoh. He's a...

28:26.122 --> 28:28.416
He's a character, but he's...
He's in camp right now.

28:28.499 --> 28:30.167
I'll introduce you.

28:33.504 --> 28:34.797
So, Matteo.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.925
- Oh, my God.
- Seems cool. Good, good guy.

28:38.008 --> 28:39.969
Don't.

28:45.266 --> 28:48.060
Nora, I'd like you
to meet Agent Cheetoh.

28:48.144 --> 28:50.563
What's up, playa?!

28:50.646 --> 28:52.857
- Oh, fuck no.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.157
Angel.

29:02.158 --> 29:03.826
Listen, I really need this gig,

29:03.909 --> 29:05.995
and I haven't had
any work in a year.

29:06.078 --> 29:09.165
Okay, I'm-I'm sorry that
I hurt your feelings earlier.

29:09.248 --> 29:13.002
You just... You weren't
who I was hoping you'd be.

29:14.753 --> 29:15.713
Okay.

29:15.796 --> 29:19.049
What I mean is,
the way I acted...

29:19.133 --> 29:21.051
that was a me thing,
not a you thing.

29:21.135 --> 29:25.181
And I'm just, I'm just
dealing with some stuff.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.891
You did a fine job.

29:26.974 --> 29:29.351
Really?

29:29.435 --> 29:30.769
Well, I mean, it depends
on who you ask,

29:30.853 --> 29:33.439
but if you ask me, yeah,
I'd rate you tops.

29:33.522 --> 29:36.609
- You would?
- Definitely.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.736
Wow.

29:38.819 --> 29:39.987
Could you actually do
the rating?

29:40.070 --> 29:41.197
'Cause that would
really help me.

29:45.326 --> 29:48.162
Thank you.

29:48.245 --> 29:49.914
That was my first five stars.

30:18.609 --> 30:21.278
Wow.

30:21.362 --> 30:22.613
What?

30:22.696 --> 30:25.574
Oh, nothing.

30:26.659 --> 30:30.287
Mr. Brown just, uh, apologized,

30:30.371 --> 30:32.289
and then he hugged me.

30:32.373 --> 30:33.541
It was really, really nice.

30:33.624 --> 30:35.334
Oh, my God.

30:35.417 --> 30:36.961
What?

30:37.044 --> 30:39.838
Okay, first of all, you do not
need to call him Mr. Brown.

30:39.922 --> 30:41.423
Really? Did he say that?

30:41.507 --> 30:42.633
Is that something
that he said to you

30:42.716 --> 30:45.511
- specifically about me?
- I meant to me. Jesus.

30:45.594 --> 30:46.679
- Okay.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.639
Oh, I can't do this again.

30:48.722 --> 30:50.349
I mean, I don't know
what it is that they see

30:50.432 --> 30:53.644
in this human bowl of oatmeal
everybody keeps falling for.

30:53.727 --> 30:55.854
I mean, what am I not seeing?

30:57.815 --> 31:00.025
He ain't even that tall.
