WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:04.963
I ask God every day
for his mercy.

00:05.046 --> 00:06.005
Gun!

00:06.089 --> 00:07.424
Because I have none!

00:07.507 --> 00:09.300
Oh, my God.

00:10.301 --> 00:12.595
A little help...

00:12.679 --> 00:13.680
Jerry's been shot!
Lou, get an ambulance,

00:13.763 --> 00:16.224
right now!

00:13.763 --> 00:16.224
Yeah, this is
Captain Lou Grover.

00:16.306 --> 00:18.601
We need EMT assistance
right now, dammit!

00:18.685 --> 00:21.396
Jerry?

00:18.685 --> 00:21.396
It hurts more
than I thought it would.

00:21.479 --> 00:23.481
You're gonna be okay,
all right? You keep breathing,

00:23.565 --> 00:25.525
you understand me?
Hang in there. You hear me?

00:25.608 --> 00:27.736
Hang in there, Jerry, all right?

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:56.264 --> 00:57.724
A-3.

00:59.601 --> 01:02.187
Okay. Well, there goes

01:02.270 --> 01:03.855
a part of my fleet, you just
sunk my carrier, man.

01:03.938 --> 01:07.317
You're cheating, huh?
Can you see my board?

01:07.400 --> 01:09.486
When I close my eyes, yes.

01:09.569 --> 01:10.737
See that, that's kind
of creepy, Jer.

01:10.820 --> 01:14.032
Look, all it takes is deploying
your probably density function,

01:14.115 --> 01:16.201
which takes into account
the different ways

01:16.284 --> 01:17.994
that the ships
can be arranged on the board.

01:18.077 --> 01:19.996
Look at you, man, you're already
sounding like your old self.

01:20.079 --> 01:21.998
Y-You'll be ready to get
out of here in no time, buddy.

01:22.081 --> 01:25.335
Yeah. I mean, don't want
to rush anything.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.796
You know, wouldn't want
to give Five-O

01:27.879 --> 01:30.507
less than 100%.

01:31.549 --> 01:33.092
Everything okay?

01:35.094 --> 01:38.515
Getting shot's
not like in the movies.

01:38.598 --> 01:41.851
Your life doesn't flash
before your eyes.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.853
When I was lying there,
all I could think about

01:43.937 --> 01:46.523
was how I was letting
Taylor and Moku down, and

01:46.606 --> 01:49.025
they'd never get a chance
to defeat the orc army

01:49.108 --> 01:51.110
and take on the Fire Giant.

01:49.108 --> 01:51.110
What?

01:51.194 --> 01:53.655
Taylor and Moku are my
Dungeons & Dragons buddies.

01:53.738 --> 01:54.989
We were in the middle
of a pretty intense campaign

01:55.073 --> 01:55.990
when I got shot.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.826
Gotcha.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.826
Anyway,

01:57.909 --> 01:59.035
it got me thinking.
I mean, if that's

01:59.118 --> 02:03.206
what's crossing my mind when
I'm staring death in the face...

02:03.289 --> 02:05.542
maybe I haven't lived enough.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.044
Hello, boys.

02:10.755 --> 02:14.175
Stunned silence. I should
dress like this more often.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.635
Yeah, you should.

02:15.718 --> 02:18.513
You look amazing.

02:15.718 --> 02:18.513
Thanks. So do you,
Jer, by the way.

02:18.596 --> 02:20.390
Aw, this old thing?

02:18.596 --> 02:20.390
Yeah.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.017
Oh, Joons, Joons, Joons,
rookie mistake,

02:23.101 --> 02:24.602
putting all your ships
at the edges.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.062
Everyone's an
expert, huh?

02:26.145 --> 02:27.772
Well, I'm happy to give you
tips, but we got to go.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.608
The opera starts in 30.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.608
I didn't know you two

02:30.692 --> 02:32.235
were into opera.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.235
I'm not.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.196
Joons is actually
the opera lover.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.196
No, blame my dad.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.739
I actually got
the tickets for him

02:36.823 --> 02:37.699
and my mom, but he
didn't want to go.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.909
Well, I, for one,
am really excited to go.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.369
I have been all day, actually.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.369
Really?

02:41.452 --> 02:42.579
Yes, really.

02:42.662 --> 02:43.621
I mean, I slept
really badly

02:43.705 --> 02:44.914
last night, so
I'm looking forward

02:44.998 --> 02:45.957
to a solid three
hours of nap time.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.876
I heard the seats
are very plush.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.628
All right,

02:50.712 --> 02:52.338
buddy.
Rematch tomorrow.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.257
Aye, aye, Admiral.
My fleet and I will be waiting.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.009
Bye, Jer.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.059
This all looks really good.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.978
Yes, it does.
It-it certainly does.

03:09.022 --> 03:09.939
What are you thinking?

03:10.023 --> 03:12.942
I don't know. Nothing.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.027
Well, uh, actually,

03:14.110 --> 03:17.447
I'm-- I've been thinking about
this friend of mine,

03:17.530 --> 03:19.449
this thing that happened at work
to a friend of mine.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.409
He's a colleague as well,
but he's a friend,

03:21.492 --> 03:24.412
and... he kind of got shot.

03:24.495 --> 03:26.915
Um... I meant, well, he didn't--
I say he kind of got shot,

03:26.998 --> 03:28.416
he got shot.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.416
Oh, my God.

03:28.499 --> 03:30.627
He's okay.
He's gonna be okay.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.837
It's just crazy,
you know?

03:32.921 --> 03:34.255
Things that happen at work.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.507
Yeah... I'm glad
everyone's okay.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.259
Thank you.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.259
I was really asking what you
were thinking about

03:38.343 --> 03:39.177
ordering for dinner.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.138
But thank you for
sharing that with me.

03:42.221 --> 03:44.432
No problem. I'm, uh-- uh--

03:44.515 --> 03:45.767
Aw.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.518
You know
something, Brooke?

03:47.602 --> 03:50.813
I got to deal
with this. Okay?

03:50.897 --> 03:51.856
Yeah.

03:50.897 --> 03:51.856
I think it's best.

03:51.940 --> 03:52.857
Yeah. It's best.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.108
Thank you.

03:58.404 --> 03:59.697
Yes?

03:59.781 --> 04:01.616
Hi. How's it going with Brooke?

04:01.699 --> 04:03.785
Dude. I don't know.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.162
I mean...

04:06.245 --> 04:07.789
I guess we're not off
to the best start.

04:07.872 --> 04:08.873
What do you mean? No.
I told you

04:08.957 --> 04:11.167
she just got divorced,
what's the matter with you?

04:11.250 --> 04:12.001
What'd you do?

04:11.250 --> 04:12.001
I didn't do anything.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.086
We're just--
We're talking, is all.

04:13.169 --> 04:14.879
That's helpful. That's good.
What did you say wrong?

04:14.963 --> 04:16.880
I don't know.
I-- Words are kind of, just,

04:16.964 --> 04:18.841
they're falling out of my mouth,
I don't know why.

04:18.925 --> 04:19.676
Do you have any game

04:19.759 --> 04:21.344
at all?
What's the matter with you?

04:21.427 --> 04:22.345
Guess what?

04:22.428 --> 04:23.554
This isn't helping, all right?

04:23.638 --> 04:25.014
You calling every five minutes.
You're breaking my rhythm.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.350
Oh. I'm sorry. Your-your rhythm?

04:25.098 --> 04:27.350
Yes.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.394
My rhythm, my flow, okay?

04:29.477 --> 04:30.979
You've called twice,
we haven't even ordered.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.398
Hey, if you'd answer my texts,
I don't have to call. See?

04:33.481 --> 04:34.899
Okay, listen, Danny?

04:34.983 --> 04:35.858
You need to ease off
a little bit.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.819
All right? Just-just
let me do my thing.

04:37.902 --> 04:38.945
I'm just a little rusty.

04:39.028 --> 04:40.446
I can't let you do your thing.
Your thing is awkward,

04:40.530 --> 04:42.240
and it makes people
uncomfortable,

04:42.323 --> 04:43.282
and you mess things up.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.368
And do me a favor.
Please don't make this weird

04:45.451 --> 04:46.786
for me, okay?
I got to see this woman

04:46.869 --> 04:47.870
every time I drop Charlie off
at school.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.372
Yeah, okay. All right.

04:49.455 --> 04:50.707
I actually just figured out
something

04:50.790 --> 04:51.708
that's gonna help
this situation.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.668
Oh, yeah? What's that?

04:55.128 --> 04:57.005
Hello?

04:57.088 --> 04:58.381
Hey, I'm so sorry
about that.

04:58.464 --> 04:59.966
That's not gonna
happen again.

05:00.049 --> 05:00.967
That's fine.

05:01.050 --> 05:04.012
That was Danny.
Who I love.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.556
Very much.
Um... but sometimes

05:06.639 --> 05:07.557
he's a little intense.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.350
Oh. Sounds like my ex.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.060
You know, it's funny
you say that.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.396
'Cause it's kind of like
a marriage, me and him.

05:13.479 --> 05:14.397
It's kind of like a very

05:14.480 --> 05:16.399
dysfunctional marriage.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.692
Well, you know what they say
about marriage.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.068
No, I don't.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.737
It's just a friendship
recognized by the police.

05:20.820 --> 05:21.904
I like that.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.031
Thank you.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.031
That's good.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.198
Let's drink to that.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.908
Cheers.

05:25.992 --> 05:26.701
Can we reset...

05:25.992 --> 05:26.701
Mm-hmm.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.244
...and order and
be humans?

05:26.784 --> 05:28.244
Yeah.

05:28.327 --> 05:30.038
Yes. Let's start over.

05:30.121 --> 05:31.122
Okay, good.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.226
Figured you'd be
asleep by now.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.562
:
I know. You and me both.

05:54.645 --> 05:58.566
But, like, the music's
actually beautiful,

05:58.649 --> 06:01.277
and the costumes are amazing,
and you know,

06:01.360 --> 06:03.112
I love that I have no idea
what they're singing about.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.958
Honey, are you okay?

06:57.041 --> 06:58.626
Oh, my God.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.626
Ma'am, what's going on?

07:01.420 --> 07:04.132
Joons, check out
your two o'clock box seats.

07:05.049 --> 07:07.760
Something's wrong.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.016
Hey, Five-O!
Stop right there!

07:14.100 --> 07:15.017
Let me see
your hands! Gun!

07:23.317 --> 07:25.194
Yeah, I think he took
the stairwell.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.194
Hey, you got eyes on him?

07:25.278 --> 07:26.988
I'm security.
What's going on?

07:25.278 --> 07:26.988
Hey. Lock this place down.

07:27.071 --> 07:27.905
No one goes in or out!

08:08.112 --> 08:10.698
Hey, uh, I'm sorry to
pull you away from your date,

08:10.781 --> 08:12.241
even though you were
blowing it, you know?

08:12.325 --> 08:13.784
Blowing it?

08:12.325 --> 08:13.784
Yeah.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.411
If by "blowing it",
you mean I got a second date,

08:15.494 --> 08:16.746
then, yeah, I guess
I was blowing it.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.080
You got a second date?

08:18.164 --> 08:19.081
Let's go, what do we know?

08:19.165 --> 08:20.917
Victim's name is Billy Sato.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.418
He's the head of the Triads.

08:22.501 --> 08:24.754
He was shot in his seat by what
appears to be a long-range

08:24.837 --> 08:26.047
rifle.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.047
And the shooter disappeared

08:26.130 --> 08:27.089
into that stairwell
over there,

08:27.173 --> 08:28.925
and security locked
the place down right away.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.761
All right, Tani, Junior,
you guys are on crowd control,

08:31.844 --> 08:32.803
all right? We're gonna
break up into groups of two,

08:32.886 --> 08:34.429
comb through this theater

08:34.514 --> 08:35.932
inch by inch
till we find this guy.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.058
Danny.

08:49.987 --> 08:52.698
I got movement.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.534
Contact!

10:39.180 --> 10:40.473
That's great, he got away.

10:47.730 --> 10:48.773
You know what,
you're being ridiculous.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.441
I'm just saying,
ten years ago

10:50.524 --> 10:51.942
I made the jump.

10:50.524 --> 10:51.942
you would have made
that jump.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.277
No, your fingertips
made the jump.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.029
The rest of your body,
not so much. You're 40.

10:55.112 --> 10:57.406
Jumping off of buildings
is a young man's game.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.908
How about next time
you get in the game?

10:58.991 --> 11:00.743
A little less chatting,
a little more chasing.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.536
Now you're being ridiculous.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.746
Hey, what do you got?

11:03.829 --> 11:05.414
Well, for starters,
this composite

11:05.498 --> 11:07.750
of our shooter based on
eyewitness descriptions

11:07.833 --> 11:10.753
and the limited
CCTV footage we had.

11:10.836 --> 11:11.712
It's been sent to every
law enforcement agency

11:11.796 --> 11:12.713
on the island.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.757
We also ID'd the getaway car.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.717
It was reported stolen
yesterday afternoon.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.052
Big surprise.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.221
Grover's following up
with the owner. Also,

11:20.304 --> 11:22.973
Tani and Junior are checking in
with local clinics and ERs,

11:23.057 --> 11:25.434
seeing if anyone matching
our suspect's description

11:25.518 --> 11:26.602
has been treated
for a GSW.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.771
Okay, good. What about
the crime scene?

11:28.854 --> 11:30.272
I assume we got the report
back from CSU.

11:30.356 --> 11:34.276
Yeah, they recovered
the shooter's rifle.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.487
They also found
this shell casing

11:36.570 --> 11:39.949
up in the catwalk
over the auditorium.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.826
That rifle configuration

11:41.909 --> 11:43.869
with the detachable barrel,
that's pretty rare.

11:43.953 --> 11:44.703
but I've seen SOF guys

11:44.787 --> 11:46.747
use something like that
in the past.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.416
Well, it's starting to sound
like our shooter

11:48.499 --> 11:50.793
might be military-trained.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.793
Right.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.002
Okay, so we're either
looking for a soldier

11:52.086 --> 11:53.796
that's got a personal beef
with Sato,

11:53.879 --> 11:57.133
or, more likely,
this was a paid hit.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.468
Look, I can think of a lot
of rivals who would want

11:59.552 --> 12:00.636
to take out the head
of the Triads,

12:00.719 --> 12:02.638
but they're all
more than capable

12:02.721 --> 12:03.806
of handling something
like this

12:03.889 --> 12:04.765
in-house.

12:03.889 --> 12:04.765
All right, Adam,

12:04.849 --> 12:06.058
why don't you reach out
to your contacts,

12:06.142 --> 12:06.976
see if anybody's talking?

12:07.059 --> 12:08.769
In the meantime,
let's get this composite out

12:08.853 --> 12:10.312
to all the military
facilities

12:10.396 --> 12:11.689
and veterans organizations
on the island,

12:11.772 --> 12:13.482
see if anybody
recognizes our hitter.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.942
On it.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.491
Now, you're telling me
someone used my car

12:22.575 --> 12:23.659
to commit a murder?

12:23.742 --> 12:25.494
Well, the car was just
a getaway vehicle.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.830
The actual murder was
committed with a gun.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.999
A sniper rifle, actually.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.625
My God, the opera house
shooting.

12:31.709 --> 12:32.751
I read about that.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.670
Mm-hmm.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.672
Do you have any cameras
at the work site

12:36.755 --> 12:38.841
where the car was stolen?

12:36.755 --> 12:38.841
Afraid not.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.177
I mean, we're still just
laying the foundation.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.846
Hmm. I don't suppose you have
a vehicle recovery system

12:43.929 --> 12:44.930
for the car.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.682
Seeing as how you didn't
list one on the police report.

12:46.765 --> 12:49.059
Correct. I wish
I could be more helpful.

12:49.143 --> 12:52.396
Eh, don't sweat it.
This is the job.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.522
We have to follow every lead.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.691
To tell you the truth,
most of 'em don't even pan out.

12:55.774 --> 12:59.570
But thank you so much
for your time, Mr. Cullen.

12:59.653 --> 13:01.197
Of course. If there's anything
else I can do for you,

13:01.280 --> 13:03.699
let me know, please.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.699
All right.

13:03.782 --> 13:07.870
Um, you know, actually,
there might be.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.663
It's unrelated
to this stuff.

13:09.747 --> 13:13.751
But, um... you wouldn't happen
to have any apartment units

13:13.834 --> 13:16.879
in your real estate portfolio,
close to town,

13:16.962 --> 13:19.757
that I won't have to
sell my plasma to make rent on?

13:21.592 --> 13:23.886
See, my wife and I
are thinking of downsizing.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.930
Both the kids are
out of the house, so...

13:26.013 --> 13:27.515
I'll have one of my leasing
agents contact you directly,

13:27.598 --> 13:28.516
make sure you're
taken care of.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.227
My man.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.686
Listen, I don't want
to put you out.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.104
Not at all.
I'm a strong advocate

13:34.188 --> 13:35.773
for giving back to
the law enforcement community.

13:35.856 --> 13:36.899
It would be my pleasure.

13:35.856 --> 13:36.899
Thank you very much.

13:36.982 --> 13:37.900
I apprecia...

13:37.983 --> 13:39.568
Wait, pardon me one second.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.238
Well, this day is
looking up.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.906
You're gonna get me
that apartment,

13:43.989 --> 13:46.909
and my team just found your car.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.120
Boss, got something
you need to see.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.789
One of the places
our composite went out to

13:51.872 --> 13:54.333
was a Veterans of Foreign
Wars bar on the island.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.085
Please tell me that somebody
recognized our shooter

13:56.168 --> 13:57.461
from that.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.461
Afraid not, but here's
what did happen.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.797
Two days ago, a woman
came into the bar

13:59.880 --> 14:00.589
looking for a guy.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.716
She left a photo
with the bar owner

14:02.800 --> 14:03.926
in case they ever
showed up there.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.054
Check this out.

14:07.137 --> 14:10.474
That's him.
That's our shooter.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.143
But wait a minute.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.729
Who the hell is this woman
looking for our suspect

14:15.813 --> 14:18.607
two days before he kills
Billy Sato?

14:15.813 --> 14:18.607
I can't tell you.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.775
She didn't leave a name
with the bar owner,

14:19.858 --> 14:21.277
just a number;
I ran it, but it's a burner.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.612
All right, we gotta run
a trace on that phone right now

14:23.696 --> 14:25.614
and find this woman.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.744
Guys, I got her.
Black SUV.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.580
She's on Kahala,
heading towards Diamond Head.

14:51.890 --> 14:54.643
Oh, hey, hey, hey!
Drop the weapon.

14:51.890 --> 14:54.643
You drop yours.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.770
I'm not gonna ask you twice.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.770
Is that a threat?

14:56.854 --> 14:58.439
Because I don't
do well with threats.

14:58.522 --> 15:01.108
Put the weapon down.

15:01.191 --> 15:02.192
I thought you said you weren't
gonna ask me again.

15:02.276 --> 15:03.193
I have
full authority

15:03.277 --> 15:04.153
from the governor of Hawaii

15:04.236 --> 15:05.654
to pull this trigger
if you don't comply.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.197
Who are you, James Bond?

15:05.738 --> 15:07.197
No.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.824
I'm Lieutenant Commander
Steve McGarrett

15:08.907 --> 15:09.658
of the Five-O Task Force.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.830
Sergeant Quinn Liu.
Military police.

15:14.913 --> 15:16.832
Military police?

15:16.915 --> 15:20.711
Why aren't you wearing
a uniform?

15:20.794 --> 15:21.712
Because, actually, I'm with CID.

15:21.795 --> 15:24.465
Okay, well, it'd be
helpful to us if you'd just

15:24.548 --> 15:26.383
pick a story and stick with it.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.801
My current rank is
none of your concern.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.386
Fair enough.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.386
Ah.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.721
Where are your credentials?

15:30.804 --> 15:33.474
That's funny, I was about
to ask for yours.

15:34.767 --> 15:35.809
Mine are right here
on my belt.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.187
Oh, I'm sorry,
I can't see that.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.355
Can you throw that
a little further?

15:39.438 --> 15:40.856
Danny, I'm gonna shoot
this woman.

15:40.939 --> 15:42.733
Look, okay, here's
the thing, all right?

15:42.816 --> 15:46.528
Okay, by the way, this is
horrible déjà vu I am having.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.238
If you're gonna shoot anybody,
shoot him, please.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.741
Okay? Here's what
we're gonna do.

15:50.824 --> 15:53.911
I'm gonna put my gun away,
like this.

15:53.994 --> 15:54.745
All right,
on the count of three,

15:54.828 --> 15:57.039
you're both gonna
put your guns away.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.708
All right? And we'll talk
like, uh, like people do.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.504
All right? One... two...

16:03.587 --> 16:04.963
three.

16:07.966 --> 16:08.842
Okay.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.891
Thank you.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.891
Why are you following me?

16:15.974 --> 16:17.851
It seems we're both looking
for the same person.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.645
Are we, now?

16:17.935 --> 16:19.645
Yeah.

16:19.728 --> 16:22.356
That photo you left
at the VFW bar.

16:22.439 --> 16:24.400
You left a number with it.
We traced that.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.111
Yeah, speaking of which,
you're military police?

16:27.194 --> 16:28.696
What are you doing
using a burner phone

16:28.779 --> 16:29.571
to conduct your business?

16:29.655 --> 16:32.950
Yeah, this has been fun,
gentlemen, but

16:33.033 --> 16:34.827
if we're done with
the roadside interrogation,

16:34.910 --> 16:36.745
I'm gonna go.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.745
We're not done.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.122
Who's this?

16:39.832 --> 16:42.710
You know this man?

16:42.793 --> 16:44.712
He's a veteran I booked
for assault charges

16:44.795 --> 16:46.088
a few months ago.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.257
He's supposed to be
checking in with me

16:48.340 --> 16:49.800
as a condition of
getting his charges dropped,

16:49.883 --> 16:51.969
but he went MIA
a couple days ago.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.930
What's his name?

16:52.052 --> 16:54.930
Tom Kendall.

16:55.013 --> 16:57.558
Former Army Ranger.

16:55.013 --> 16:57.558
Tom Kendall.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.643
I'll have Grover
update the APB.

16:59.727 --> 17:00.644
Thank you.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.479
APB?

17:02.563 --> 17:03.605
What the hell's going on?

17:03.689 --> 17:05.065
Tom Kendall is
a primary suspect

17:05.148 --> 17:06.442
in a murder investigation
we're on.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.404
What? What's that look?

17:10.487 --> 17:14.742
Tom is the second veteran
to go MIA recently.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.285
I was getting concerned
it was a pattern.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.578
What are you talking
about, a pattern?

17:18.704 --> 17:21.623
Hold on.
Yeah, Tani, what do you got?

17:21.707 --> 17:24.084
Hey, our sniper had an
accomplice drive him

17:24.167 --> 17:25.586
to Wahiawa General.

17:25.669 --> 17:27.337
His car is abandoned
in the parking lot

17:27.421 --> 17:29.131
outside the ER.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.131
Okay, so,

17:29.214 --> 17:30.799
he must have gone there
to get treatment, yeah?

17:30.883 --> 17:31.884
Not quite.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.636
There's a blood trail
leading to a parking spot

17:34.720 --> 17:36.138
of a Dr. Gao.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.306
And we checked in
with the hospital.

17:37.389 --> 17:38.849
Gao never showed up
for his shift today.

17:38.932 --> 17:40.434
Well, they grabbed him, right?

17:40.517 --> 17:42.311
They grabbed a doctor
to... to take away

17:42.394 --> 17:43.812
and patch up the injured sniper?

17:43.896 --> 17:45.481
Yeah, but the good news is
the doctor's car

17:45.564 --> 17:46.815
was fitted with a
vehicle recovery system,

17:46.899 --> 17:48.650
so units are en route
as we speak.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.778
All right, keep me posted.
Keep your hand off that gun.

17:50.861 --> 17:51.653
Let's go!

17:51.737 --> 17:53.697
What, seriously?

17:53.781 --> 17:55.324
After all that,
you're just gonna leave?

17:55.407 --> 17:56.950
Yeah, I just--
I gotta follow him.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.035
Where are you going?

17:58.118 --> 17:59.495
I don't know.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.009
On your knees.
Hands behind your head.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.524
Perimeter's set.
We're good to move in.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.150
Affirmative.

18:30.234 --> 18:33.195
On me.

18:41.119 --> 18:42.204
Hands, hands, hands, up.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.373
Hands up. Right there.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.499
Don't move.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.499
I didn't do anything.

18:45.582 --> 18:46.375
He just shot himself.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.586
Clear, sir. Both sides clear.

18:55.008 --> 18:56.885
Hey, Danny, check this out.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.887
Kendall's burner.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.556
ME found it on his body.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.224
Look at the texts
that he sent.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.892
"911. Need extraction."

19:03.976 --> 19:05.561
He sent that at 8:37
last night,

19:05.644 --> 19:07.020
right after he shot Sato.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.940
Okay, so there's
definitely an accomplice.

19:10.023 --> 19:11.525
That explains
the getaway car,

19:11.608 --> 19:13.527
but the only problem is
I just spoke to that doctor.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.696
He told me that Kendall
stuck him up by himself.

19:15.779 --> 19:16.655
He was alone.

19:16.738 --> 19:19.116
So where's the accomplice now?

19:16.738 --> 19:19.116
I don't know.

19:19.199 --> 19:21.243
I'm gonna have Tani run
a trace on this number.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.579
Or...

19:23.662 --> 19:25.539
Or what?
What are you doing?

19:25.622 --> 19:27.749
You're texting the guy?

19:27.833 --> 19:28.792
Yeah.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.295
Why would you do that?
That-That's a terrible idea.

19:31.378 --> 19:32.880
What if he gets spooked
and he dumps the phone?

19:32.963 --> 19:33.881
Then what do we got?

19:33.964 --> 19:34.756
You sent it.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.300
What if it works?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.300
What if it doesn't work?

19:36.383 --> 19:37.926
It might work.

19:36.383 --> 19:37.926
It might not work.

19:38.010 --> 19:38.886
It's like a 50/50.

19:38.010 --> 19:38.886
Yeah, well, so you like--

19:38.969 --> 19:40.721
Hey, what did I tell you?

19:40.804 --> 19:42.598
Look at that.

19:42.681 --> 19:43.640
Unbelievable.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.434
"Schedule stays the same.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.727
We proceed with
remaining targets."

19:46.810 --> 19:47.811
Okay, so they got
more hits planned.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.605
All right.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.899
Danny, check it out.
Sergeant Liu said

19:51.982 --> 19:54.276
Kendall was one of two vets
who went MIA recently,

19:54.359 --> 19:55.777
which means she knows
who the other one is.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.446
Maybe she can get
a locale on that guy.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.906
I'll call her right now.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.906
All right.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.125
Thank you for
brokering this meeting.

20:10.208 --> 20:11.793
I know without you
vouching for me,

20:11.877 --> 20:14.004
none of these men
would be here.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.297
I only agreed
to help you because

20:15.380 --> 20:18.634
of your relationship
with my daughter.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.761
I understand you
and my Tamiko

20:20.844 --> 20:23.847
have been spending quite
a lot of time together.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.642
So I must ask,

20:26.725 --> 20:27.768
what are your intentions?

20:29.728 --> 20:33.982
Tamiko and I have become
close friends.

20:34.066 --> 20:37.152
I-I assure you
that's all she is.

20:45.452 --> 20:49.623
This is Adam Noshimuri
with the Five-O Task Force.

20:49.706 --> 20:52.668
You will answer
his questions.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.336
Gentlemen, thank you
for meeting with me.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.463
To be clear,

20:56.546 --> 20:58.173
I don't believe any of you
were directly involved

20:58.256 --> 20:59.383
in the hit last night.

20:59.466 --> 21:02.177
Now, that said,
if anyone knows

21:02.260 --> 21:04.179
who would benefit
from Billy Sato's death,

21:04.262 --> 21:05.889
it's the people in this room.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.850
No one stood to gain
from taking out Sato.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.228
At least no one
within the yakuza.

21:11.311 --> 21:15.065
Okay, so maybe
this was internal.

21:15.148 --> 21:17.985
Part of a power play
within the Triad organization.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.611
I know people
inside the Triads.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.196
They're certain
it wasn't one of their own.

21:21.279 --> 21:23.198
So, if it
wasn't a rival,

21:23.281 --> 21:25.325
and the hit
wasn't ordered from within,

21:25.409 --> 21:26.868
then who does that leave?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.042
Who is it?

21:35.085 --> 21:37.045
Open it.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.840
Where is he? Where's your boss?

21:39.923 --> 21:41.717
Hey. You can't
go in there.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.802
Sgt. Quinn Liu, military police.

21:44.803 --> 21:45.637
I'm gonna need you
to come with me.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.055
Unless you have a
warrant for my arrest,

21:47.139 --> 21:48.640
that's not gonna happen.

21:50.767 --> 21:51.893
Thought so.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.396
Whoa...

21:54.479 --> 21:55.939
Just so we're clear,

21:56.023 --> 21:58.900
the only way I'm leaving here
is with you.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.652
Okay, let's all
just take a breath.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.905
Hey, easy, easy.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.866
I don't recall
asking you to speak.

22:05.949 --> 22:07.242
Okay, listen,

22:07.325 --> 22:09.870
I'm gonna reach for
my credentials now,

22:09.953 --> 22:12.122
and I promise you I'm unarmed.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.459
Adam Noshimuri, Five-O.

22:15.542 --> 22:17.210
Lower your weapon.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.879
Everybody lower their weapon.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.090
Figures.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.093
You guys have been all up
in my business today.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.596
Would you mind telling me
what you're doing here?

22:27.679 --> 22:31.099
I'm trying to track down two
veterans who have gone missing.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.310
One of them,
a retired Army Ranger

22:33.393 --> 22:34.811
by the name of Tom Kendall

22:34.895 --> 22:37.773
appears to have been involved
in the shooting last night.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.232
And now it's looking
like the second one

22:39.316 --> 22:40.859
may be wrapped up in it as well.

22:40.942 --> 22:42.444
And what does
any of this have to do

22:42.527 --> 22:44.571
with me?

22:42.527 --> 22:44.571
Not much, really.

22:44.654 --> 22:45.697
Except that
he's a trained sniper

22:45.781 --> 22:48.116
and I just stopped by
his apartment and found these.

22:51.078 --> 22:54.081
Reconnaissance photos of you.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.463
Don't let us stand in your way.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.965
Hey. This is kind of a bad time.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.550
Yo, Adam, McGarrett and Danny
just discovered

23:05.634 --> 23:07.969
text communications
between Tom Kendall and someone

23:08.053 --> 23:11.348
who could be his coconspirator,
a vet named Marcus Sanders.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.642
Also, it looks like they could
be planning multiple hits.

23:13.725 --> 23:16.561
The good news is that we got an
active trace on Sanders' cell.

23:16.645 --> 23:17.813
Units are headed over now
to pick him up.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.189
Where is he right now?

23:19.272 --> 23:20.899
Kahala beach. Why?

23:23.068 --> 23:24.486
Adam, what's going on?

23:24.569 --> 23:26.988
Everybody get away
from the windows, now!

23:40.043 --> 23:43.296
Let's go. Come on,
come on, come on.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.151
Listen to me,
we can't wait this one out.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.820
Sanders is Special Forces, which
means one way or the other,

24:06.903 --> 24:08.113
he is getting in here.

24:09.739 --> 24:13.368
I wouldn't be so sure.
My men have him outnumbered.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.830
Yeah. For now.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.042
Let's move.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.723
You all right?

24:33.138 --> 24:34.723
Yeah.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.391
Move and take Masuda.

24:36.474 --> 24:38.602
Go.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.478
We got to get you out of here.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.322
Steve,

25:32.405 --> 25:33.448
suspect's on the move.

25:33.531 --> 25:34.491
He's in a beige GMC

25:34.574 --> 25:35.492
with raised tires.

25:35.575 --> 25:37.327
Heading northbound on Kuhio.

25:37.410 --> 25:39.162
Copy that.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.132
This is good,
we're chasing a monster truck.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.467
That's totally
normal, right?

25:56.429 --> 25:58.223
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

26:21.121 --> 26:22.664
Definitely don't
see that every day.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.714
Oh, good.
You two have met.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.299
Yeah, Adam brought her in.

26:32.382 --> 26:34.509
He's with Grover in rendition
right now with Masuda.

26:34.592 --> 26:35.969
Yeah, Steve just joined them.

26:36.052 --> 26:38.179
Hey, you should, uh,
get that looked at by a doctor.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.347
That's what I said.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.849
I don't need a doctor.

26:40.932 --> 26:43.476
What I need is answers.
What I need

26:43.560 --> 26:45.562
is to figure out how
two vets got caught up

26:45.645 --> 26:47.147
in an organized crime gang war.

26:47.230 --> 26:50.358
Are-are you sure
you're not related to Steve

26:50.442 --> 26:51.818
in any way?

26:51.901 --> 26:53.236
Hey, yo.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.236
Yo.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.196
Hey. Whoa, uh,

26:55.280 --> 26:57.365
you should get that
checked out.

26:57.449 --> 26:58.658
Seriously? It's
just a graze.

26:58.742 --> 27:01.369
You guys are
such wimps.

26:58.742 --> 27:01.369
No...

27:01.453 --> 27:03.747
Okay.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.747
Uh, so, uh, autopsy results

27:03.830 --> 27:05.248
came back on our sniper,
Tom Kendall,

27:05.332 --> 27:07.000
and his blood
work contained

27:07.083 --> 27:08.543
trace levels of psilocybin.

27:08.626 --> 27:10.587
It's-it's a psychedelic
compound found

27:10.670 --> 27:12.380
in magic mushrooms.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.380
Yeah, I know
what it is.

27:12.464 --> 27:15.175
Uh, just seems like a weird time
to take mushrooms, no?

27:15.258 --> 27:16.134
Hold on.

27:16.217 --> 27:18.386
Psilocybin is being used
in a clinical trial

27:18.470 --> 27:19.804
to treat post-traumatic stress.

27:19.888 --> 27:22.223
I know that
because Marcus Sanders

27:22.307 --> 27:23.683
is a participant in a study
that's being conducted

27:23.767 --> 27:24.893
down at the VA hospital.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.103
Well, if that's
the case,

27:27.187 --> 27:29.147
then maybe Kendall was also
a participant in that study.

27:29.230 --> 27:31.107
And the fact that both
of them had that in common,

27:31.191 --> 27:32.942
that can't be a coincidence.

27:33.026 --> 27:34.527
Yeah, I agree.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.239
Someone is recruiting snipers
from within that study.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.700
Yeah, that actually
makes a lot of sense

27:40.784 --> 27:42.911
if you think about it, because
you have this large sample group

27:42.994 --> 27:44.746
of these highly-skilled vets,

27:44.829 --> 27:46.206
all suffering from
post-traumatic stress.

27:46.289 --> 27:47.791
They're struggling
to reintegrate

27:47.874 --> 27:49.918
into civilian life...

27:47.874 --> 27:49.918
And then
someone comes along

27:50.001 --> 27:52.128
and offers them an opportunity
to repurpose their skills.

27:52.212 --> 27:53.755
That's pretty tempting.

27:53.838 --> 27:56.299
Okay. Why-why don't you have,
uh, Jerry look into that study,

27:56.383 --> 27:57.717
see who has access
to those records

27:57.801 --> 27:59.260
or if there was
a data breach?

27:59.344 --> 28:00.428
Okay.

27:59.344 --> 28:00.428
Hey, yo.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.472
Guys. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You shot?

28:02.555 --> 28:03.515
It's fine.

28:03.598 --> 28:04.682
You sure?

28:03.598 --> 28:04.682
Yeah.

28:04.766 --> 28:06.393
Did you get something
from Masuda?

28:06.476 --> 28:08.269
Yeah, we did.
Let me see that.

28:08.353 --> 28:09.437
It doesn't look fine.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.064
It's better
than my last one.

28:11.147 --> 28:13.149
Okay, look, this whole time,
we were thinking

28:13.233 --> 28:14.776
this was all about
organized crime.

28:14.859 --> 28:17.278
In fact, it turns out
it was personal.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.613
Back in
the early '90s,

28:18.696 --> 28:19.781
before they were
up-and-comers

28:19.864 --> 28:23.118
in their respective crime
syndicates, Sato and Masuda

28:23.201 --> 28:26.287
worked as enforcers for a local
loan shark named Isko Zhang.

28:26.371 --> 28:29.290
A third man, Michael Lee,

28:29.374 --> 28:31.000
was part of the crew as well,

28:31.084 --> 28:32.794
serving as
the point person responsible

28:32.877 --> 28:34.587
for brokering
Zhang's loans.

28:34.671 --> 28:36.256
As enforcers
for this loan shark,

28:36.339 --> 28:39.676
Masuda and Sato were in the
business of collecting debts

28:39.759 --> 28:41.136
by any means necessary,
whether it be

28:41.219 --> 28:44.097
bodily harm, breaking bones
or worse.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.807
Well, it makes sense to believe
that there's some people

28:45.890 --> 28:47.308
out there that want
some payback.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.144
True.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.144
Uh, yeah. Well, here's
what doesn't make sense,

28:49.227 --> 28:50.603
is the timing of it all.

28:50.687 --> 28:52.188
These guys haven't worked
together in decades.

28:52.272 --> 28:53.273
Why are they choosing now
to get revenge?

28:53.356 --> 28:54.607
Check this out.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.526
The loan shark, Isko Zhang,

28:56.609 --> 28:58.153
is still alive
and living on Oahu,

28:58.236 --> 29:01.156
but the other guy who was part
of that crew, Michael Lee,

29:01.239 --> 29:02.657
he was killed
two weeks ago.

29:02.740 --> 29:05.952
His body was found beaten
and tortured just a few days

29:06.035 --> 29:08.204
after being released from
a federal prison in Arizona.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.165
He had just served
a 15-year sentence.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.500
Someone who borrowed
money from this crew

29:12.584 --> 29:15.670
back in the day wants revenge,
but Lee is the face

29:15.753 --> 29:18.298
of the operation, so they only
know about his involvement.

29:18.381 --> 29:20.300
But he's in jail,
so they wait for him to get out,

29:20.383 --> 29:22.552
grab him, torture him till he
gives up his accomplices.

29:22.635 --> 29:24.304
Sato and Masuda,

29:24.387 --> 29:25.513
who are both targeted

29:25.597 --> 29:27.515
for assassination
within 24 hours.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.184
Hang on a second.
That text message

29:29.267 --> 29:31.186
that Sanders sent,

29:31.269 --> 29:34.772
it said "proceed with all
remaining targets," plural.

29:34.856 --> 29:35.857
We know Masuda
was one of them.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.692
And given that Sato and Lee

29:37.775 --> 29:39.152
were already dead,

29:39.235 --> 29:40.862
that only leaves one person.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.071
The loan shark.

29:42.155 --> 29:44.616
Isko Zhang.

29:46.201 --> 29:47.243
Details are just now emerging

29:47.327 --> 29:48.995
about the police pursuit

29:49.078 --> 29:51.039
through Waikiki this afternoon

29:51.122 --> 29:53.875
that resulted in dozens
of damaged vehicles.

29:53.958 --> 29:57.337
We have just learned that
the suspect is still at large

29:57.420 --> 30:00.340
and is wanted in connection with
the assassination of Billy Sato

30:00.423 --> 30:03.051
and the attempted murder
of Hajime Masuda.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.570
Can't this thing go any faster?

30:23.821 --> 30:24.864
What?

30:24.948 --> 30:26.241
Nothing.

30:26.324 --> 30:27.992
I've just never had
that complaint before.

30:57.564 --> 30:59.524
Isko Zhang, Five-O!

31:03.528 --> 31:05.905
On me.

31:51.242 --> 31:52.368
Drop your weapon.

32:00.251 --> 32:01.336
Don't do it, Marcus.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.981
Look, I-I-I know this
doesn't make it any easier,

32:22.065 --> 32:24.567
but he didn't exactly
give you much choice.

32:24.651 --> 32:26.694
You're right.

32:26.778 --> 32:30.156
Doesn't make it any easier.

32:31.574 --> 32:32.742
I'm supposed to be
watching out

32:32.825 --> 32:36.371
for these guys, making sure they
don't fall through the cracks,

32:36.454 --> 32:38.373
and now they're both dead.

32:38.456 --> 32:40.708
Yeah, but why
are they dead?

32:40.792 --> 32:42.377
I'll tell you why
they're dead, all right?

32:42.460 --> 32:44.379
They're dead because
they agreed to take part

32:44.462 --> 32:47.215
in a murder
for hire plot, Quinn.

32:47.298 --> 32:49.801
How is that your fault?

32:56.641 --> 32:58.184
Yeah, Jerry?

32:58.267 --> 32:59.018
I took a deep dive

32:59.102 --> 33:01.104
into that post-traumatic
stress study

33:01.187 --> 33:02.897
that Marcus Sanders
and Tom Kendall

33:02.980 --> 33:04.941
were participants in.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.693
Couldn't find any evidence
of a data breach,

33:06.776 --> 33:09.404
but I dug deeper and I came up
with a list of everyone

33:09.487 --> 33:11.364
that had access
to the confidential records.

33:11.447 --> 33:13.574
I bet that's
a long list.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.368
43 names,

33:15.451 --> 33:17.912
but one of the names turned up
in your investigation already.

33:17.995 --> 33:19.956
Who's that?

33:23.042 --> 33:25.086
So what I was trying to say

33:25.169 --> 33:27.004
when the...

33:27.088 --> 33:28.923
Pardon me, Judge,
I hate to interrupt

33:29.006 --> 33:31.676
this beautiful
culinary experience.

33:31.759 --> 33:33.386
Uh, Captain Grover,
is there a problem?

33:33.469 --> 33:34.929
Oh, no, no, no. We're all good.

33:35.012 --> 33:36.472
Nothing for you
to be concerned about.

33:36.556 --> 33:39.517
I just need to have a word
with my good friend, Mr. Cullen.

33:45.231 --> 33:46.983
Hey.

33:47.066 --> 33:50.236
I assume this is
about my stolen car?

33:50.319 --> 33:52.447
Yeah, well,
that and some other things.

33:52.530 --> 33:55.158
Mr. Cullen, this is
my colleague, Steve McGarrett,

33:55.241 --> 33:57.118
and this is Sergeant Quinn Liu

33:57.201 --> 33:59.454
with CID.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.414
Pleasure to meet you both.
What is this all about?

34:01.497 --> 34:04.959
Well, we looked into you,
Mr. Cullen, and it turns out,

34:05.042 --> 34:06.043
back in the early '90s,

34:06.127 --> 34:08.295
when you were starting up
your real estate business,

34:08.379 --> 34:10.590
you were over-leveraged
and in need of fast cash,

34:10.672 --> 34:13.301
so you borrowed money
from Michael Lee,

34:13.384 --> 34:16.471
not knowing that he was just
the front man for Isko Zhang.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.473
Which was a shame

34:18.556 --> 34:20.308
because Zhang was
an old-school loan shark.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.935
I mean, this is a guy who'd
rather break both your legs

34:23.018 --> 34:26.355
than to see you even come up
a dollar short on payment.

34:26.438 --> 34:28.149
And, unfortunately
for you,

34:28.232 --> 34:31.152
the real estate market tanked
and then you went belly-up.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.445
And Zhang
must've figured

34:32.527 --> 34:34.280
that loan was never
gonna get repaid

34:34.362 --> 34:36.157
because a few months later

34:36.239 --> 34:38.659
your Mercedes exploded
outside of your house.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.828
Yeah, uh,
we-we read the police report.

34:40.911 --> 34:42.955
You were supposed to be
in that car that day,

34:43.039 --> 34:44.706
but, uh, unfortunately,
for some reason,

34:44.791 --> 34:49.378
your wife decided to drive
your daughter to school, right?

34:49.462 --> 34:50.797
They were both killed
in the explosion.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.132
Is there a point to all this,

34:53.216 --> 34:54.967
or you just come here
to interrupt my dinner

34:55.051 --> 34:57.678
and upset me?

34:55.051 --> 34:57.678
The point is, sir,

34:57.762 --> 34:58.888
that not only did you

34:58.971 --> 35:00.473
make it through
that period of your life,

35:00.556 --> 35:02.558
you've kind of
recreated yourself,

35:02.642 --> 35:04.852
become this big success, yeah?

35:04.936 --> 35:07.188
But you were
doing something else

35:07.271 --> 35:08.397
during that time period,
weren't you?

35:08.481 --> 35:10.858
You were planning,

35:10.942 --> 35:12.735
waiting for the chance
to get revenge.

35:12.819 --> 35:15.238
And that opportunity finally
came up when Michael Lee

35:15.321 --> 35:17.990
was released from prison
15 years later.

35:18.074 --> 35:19.534
See, that
makes sense to me

35:19.617 --> 35:22.370
because what you have done
recently is use your connections

35:22.453 --> 35:25.456
to the post-traumatic stress
study that you-you financed

35:25.540 --> 35:27.583
to recruit a couple
of military-trained hitters.

35:27.667 --> 35:30.545
You turned them
loose onto Lee

35:30.628 --> 35:33.381
to torture him and get the names
of the accomplices.

35:33.464 --> 35:35.049
And don't forget
he ordered them

35:35.132 --> 35:35.925
to kill all--
You remember,

35:36.008 --> 35:37.385
you ordered them
to kill all four guys.

35:37.468 --> 35:40.596
I was sorry to hear
that two brave servicemen

35:40.680 --> 35:42.932
lost their lives,

35:43.015 --> 35:45.226
but the other victims,

35:45.309 --> 35:47.395
Sato and Lee...

35:47.478 --> 35:49.856
people of Hawaii aren't gonna be
mourning them any time soon.

35:49.939 --> 35:51.858
As far as this theory

35:51.941 --> 35:53.693
that I hired them
to do what they did?

35:53.776 --> 35:56.404
That's all it is. It's a theory.

35:56.487 --> 35:59.407
But here's the thing,
I'm gonna bet on that theory.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.450
So my friend Lou here,
he's gonna put some handcuffs on

36:01.534 --> 36:03.828
and then take you away.

36:03.911 --> 36:04.996
Turn your ass around.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.875
Wes Cullen,
you are under arrest

36:08.958 --> 36:10.668
for conspiracy
to commit murder.

36:21.220 --> 36:22.388
Big fella.

36:22.471 --> 36:24.307
O.G.

36:22.471 --> 36:24.307
What's good, baby?

36:24.390 --> 36:27.059
All set for Jerry's
welcome back party?

36:27.143 --> 36:28.728
Yes, sir.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.728
All right.

36:28.811 --> 36:30.396
And since the guest of honor
is not here yet,

36:30.479 --> 36:32.565
it's a good time to broach
the subject of the bill.

36:32.648 --> 36:34.358
Okay, wh-what about
the bill?

36:34.442 --> 36:39.071
Oh, it's just that nobody likes
to see a good celebration marred

36:39.155 --> 36:40.907
by that awkward moment

36:40.990 --> 36:43.159
when the bill
is placed on the table.

36:43.242 --> 36:46.579
So which one of you nice fellas
want to pick up the tab today?

36:46.662 --> 36:48.664
What in the hell
is the matter with you?

36:48.748 --> 36:49.790
Everyone,
including you,

36:49.874 --> 36:53.252
is supposed to contribute
to the cost of this thing.

36:53.336 --> 36:55.963
Jerry is your friend,
too, man. Damn.

36:56.047 --> 36:59.508
No doubt. That's why
I graciously extended

36:59.592 --> 37:02.595
a 5% discount on all menu items,

37:02.678 --> 37:04.805
beer and wine excluded,
of course.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.474
Of course. 5%, that's very

37:06.557 --> 37:08.142
gracious, nice.

37:08.225 --> 37:09.560
Hey, Jerry's
'ohana, brah.

37:09.644 --> 37:11.646
It's the least I can do.

37:11.729 --> 37:12.980
Oh, you doing the least,
all right.

37:13.064 --> 37:17.485
So with a party of six or more,

37:17.568 --> 37:21.155
we usually add on
an 18% gratuity to the bill.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.282
Are you guys good with that,

37:23.366 --> 37:26.285
or you guys like add on
a little bit more?

37:34.752 --> 37:36.337
Wow.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.047
Nice Bonnie.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.047
Thanks.

37:38.130 --> 37:39.048
What year is that?

37:39.131 --> 37:40.675
'72.

37:43.260 --> 37:46.138
Look, I just wanted to come by
and say thank you.

37:46.222 --> 37:48.808
I heard you called
my former supervisor at CID

37:48.891 --> 37:50.351
and put in a good word for me.

37:50.434 --> 37:52.311
Ah.

37:50.434 --> 37:52.311
Not that I think it's gonna

37:52.395 --> 37:53.521
make a difference.

37:53.604 --> 37:56.691
You are not that guy's favorite
person, you know that, right?

37:56.774 --> 37:59.318
Yeah, the feeling is mutual.

37:59.402 --> 38:02.279
I got to admit, I was kind of,
uh, curious as to how

38:02.363 --> 38:06.075
a staff sergeant in CID
can get knocked all the way down

38:06.158 --> 38:07.076
to military police.

38:07.159 --> 38:10.204
And it's crazy, it turns out
all you got to do is

38:10.288 --> 38:12.999
break into
a barracks,

38:13.082 --> 38:15.084
disregard
direct orders,

38:15.167 --> 38:18.212
and forge a sergeant major's
signature. That's it.

38:18.295 --> 38:20.339
Closed the case, didn't I?

38:18.295 --> 38:20.339
Yeah, you did.

38:22.633 --> 38:23.551
Uh, look, I'm sure

38:23.634 --> 38:25.177
you already heard,
but the prosecuting attorney

38:25.261 --> 38:27.680
isn't gonna be
charging Cullen.

38:27.763 --> 38:31.100
Doesn't feel like he has enough
evidence for a conviction,

38:31.183 --> 38:33.102
which means it's gonna be
up to us to make that case.

38:33.185 --> 38:33.936
Us?

38:34.020 --> 38:36.689
Yeah, us. I got to do
everything I can

38:36.772 --> 38:40.192
to bring Cullen to justice,
and it's your case, too,

38:40.276 --> 38:42.028
so, I mean, I think
you should be involved.

38:42.111 --> 38:44.238
I hope you want
to be involved.

38:42.111 --> 38:44.238
I do.

38:44.321 --> 38:45.531
Good.

38:47.658 --> 38:48.993
Thank you.

38:49.076 --> 38:50.745
That actually means
a lot to me.

38:50.828 --> 38:53.706
Of course. Listen,
you've come all this way,

38:53.789 --> 38:55.624
why don't you, uh,
why don't you stick around?

38:58.002 --> 38:59.628
Come-- come on.

39:04.008 --> 39:07.094
Hey! Sergeant Liu.

39:07.178 --> 39:10.056
So nice of you to join us.

39:07.178 --> 39:10.056
Please, call me Quinn.

39:10.139 --> 39:12.558
So, uh, girl's got to eat.
What's good here?

39:12.641 --> 39:14.101
It's all, uh, you know,
it's just shrimp

39:14.185 --> 39:16.395
and garlic, some variation
of shrimp and garlic.

39:16.479 --> 39:19.774
So check it out. You'll see.

39:16.479 --> 39:19.774
You guys want anything?

39:19.857 --> 39:22.234
No.

39:19.857 --> 39:22.234
No, thank you very much.

39:22.318 --> 39:24.278
Let me ask you a question,
what did you do?

39:24.361 --> 39:26.614
No, not with her,
with Brooke.

39:26.697 --> 39:27.990
What are you
talking about?

39:28.074 --> 39:29.033
Well, I texted her to see

39:29.116 --> 39:29.658
if she was looking forward
to your second date.

39:29.742 --> 39:31.410
No reply,
so I assume

39:31.494 --> 39:32.453
you screwed things up.

39:32.536 --> 39:33.454
Didn't screw it up.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.247
We're going on a second date.

39:35.331 --> 39:36.457
It's all good,
except, uh,

39:36.540 --> 39:38.459
you don't know about it 'cause

39:38.542 --> 39:40.002
we're breaking up
with you, Danny.

39:40.086 --> 39:43.130
Breaking up with me?
What does that mean?

39:43.214 --> 39:44.256
What it means
is there's

39:44.340 --> 39:47.134
not gonna be any more
phone calls, no more texts.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.638
Nah, don't look at him. No more
texts, no more pestering us

39:50.721 --> 39:52.139
about the nature
of our relationship.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.475
You are now officially
on radio silence.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.435
Oh. Cut me out.

39:56.519 --> 39:57.478
You can't cut me out.

39:57.561 --> 39:59.897
I c-can,
and I did, and I have.

39:59.980 --> 40:02.066
It was her idea.
How about that? Her idea.

40:02.149 --> 40:04.151
Looks like Mom and Dad
are fighting again.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.528
Hey, Jerry!

40:05.611 --> 40:07.655
Jerry, my man.
Welcome back, baby.

40:07.738 --> 40:10.116
Wow. Hey, everybody.
Thanks for making it out.

40:10.199 --> 40:12.159
I'm grateful for the support.

40:12.243 --> 40:15.037
Well, we're really grateful
to have you back, man, so,

40:15.121 --> 40:17.164
you know, you just do what
you need to do, rest up,

40:17.248 --> 40:19.333
take as long as you need,
and-and come back to work

40:19.416 --> 40:20.543
whenever you're ready,
all right?

40:20.626 --> 40:23.003
Yeah.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.505
About that...

40:25.798 --> 40:27.925
Jer, what's going on?

40:29.927 --> 40:31.971
Look, joining Five-O

40:32.054 --> 40:34.223
is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

40:34.306 --> 40:38.185
Not just because it gave me
a job and a sense of purpose,

40:38.269 --> 40:41.021
but, well,
'cause it gave me an 'ohana.

40:41.105 --> 40:44.150
But having a close
brush with death

40:44.233 --> 40:46.026
really makes you think about
how you're living your life.

40:47.611 --> 40:49.321
And you realize
how precious time is.

40:49.405 --> 40:51.198
There's something
I've always wanted to do,

40:51.282 --> 40:52.658
and I've always pushed it aside,

40:52.741 --> 40:54.201
figuring I'd get around to it
someday.

40:55.786 --> 40:58.664
Which is why I've decided
to step away from the team,

40:58.747 --> 41:01.083
so I can focus
on the next chapter.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.214
Which is?

41:07.298 --> 41:09.175
I want to write a book.

41:09.258 --> 41:10.342
I've been researching it
for years.

41:10.426 --> 41:12.052
It's about the connection
between the Federal Reserve

41:12.136 --> 41:13.846
and the sinking
of the Titanic.

41:13.929 --> 41:16.015
Makes perfect sense.

41:16.974 --> 41:20.728
Jerry,

41:20.811 --> 41:22.938
I hope it's a huge success.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.524
Thanks.

41:28.986 --> 41:31.238
Hey, why the
glum faces?

41:31.322 --> 41:32.948
I'll still be around to hang.

41:33.032 --> 41:35.451
And, I don't know,
maybe consult on a case,

41:35.534 --> 41:37.536
should the need arise,
or from time to time.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.872
Okay, I got
a bunch of witnesses.

41:39.955 --> 41:41.874
I'm gonna take you up on that,
Jerry, okay? Just so you know.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.672
Look at that,
you're making me cry.

41:48.756 --> 41:50.090
No, you made yourself cry.

41:50.174 --> 41:52.259
You know what, buddy?
I'm gonna miss

41:52.343 --> 41:54.178
having you around,
I'll tell you that for sure.

41:54.261 --> 41:56.138
Okay. All right.

41:56.222 --> 41:58.098
Come on, everybody,
group hug.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.935
Bring it in.

42:01.018 --> 42:01.936
You too, new girl.

42:02.019 --> 42:03.437
There's plenty of room.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.272
Aw, come on.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.272
No, I'm-I'm all right.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.274
Ah, come on!

42:07.358 --> 42:10.110
Come on, come on, please.

42:07.358 --> 42:10.110
