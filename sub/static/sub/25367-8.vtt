<i>Previously on</i> "The Affair"

00:08.418 --> 00:10.777
I know I'm disappointing you.
What if I left?

00:10.854 --> 00:12.556
Would you be willing
to give me the time

00:12.633 --> 00:14.691
- to go away...
- Yes.

00:15.145 --> 00:16.452
I'm going home.

00:16.529 --> 00:18.044
Back to your wife.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.831
No. The truth is, I'm in
love with somebody else.

00:20.908 --> 00:22.997
And I have tried for years

00:23.074 --> 00:25.841
to get her out of my mind,
but it just never works,

00:25.926 --> 00:27.490
and I don't want to wake up
in ten years

00:27.567 --> 00:29.238
and want to kill myself
'cause I was just trying

00:29.315 --> 00:30.302
to do the right thing.

00:30.379 --> 00:31.685
You know what we should do?

00:31.762 --> 00:33.456
We should meet up all over
the country at different

00:33.533 --> 00:34.924
PTSD conferences.

00:35.394 --> 00:36.568
What?

00:36.645 --> 00:38.988
Can you switch weekends
in two weeks?

00:39.065 --> 00:40.332
Uh, yeah.

00:40.442 --> 00:41.770
Sure. Why?

00:41.848 --> 00:44.058
I have this conference
I want to go to in Milwaukee.

00:44.135 --> 00:45.112
Done.

00:45.190 --> 00:47.669
My wife... she goes crazy
with both kids

00:47.746 --> 00:49.066
on the weekends,
and I'm already late.

00:49.143 --> 00:50.755
Hey, listen.
It's not what you think.

00:50.832 --> 00:52.019
Does she know you're married?

00:52.096 --> 00:53.167
Look, I'm gonna tell her.

00:53.244 --> 00:55.076
- Why don't I tell her myself?
- Hey, hey.

00:55.487 --> 00:56.983
What do you know
about your dad?

00:57.060 --> 00:58.257
Nothing.

00:58.335 --> 01:00.309
Athena must have some idea
who he is.

01:00.386 --> 01:01.802
Nope. She says she doesn't.

01:01.879 --> 01:03.495
I'm sure you could find him
if you wanted to.

01:03.572 --> 01:06.490
And say what? You're a shit?
Thanks for nothing?

01:06.567 --> 01:08.646
- You're my father?
- Yes.

01:08.731 --> 01:10.660
Why are you contacting me now?

01:10.821 --> 01:12.113
My kidneys are failing.

01:12.190 --> 01:13.888
Alison, don't go.

01:14.457 --> 01:15.583
Alison?

01:15.692 --> 01:17.247
Wait, Noah, I can't breathe.

01:17.324 --> 01:18.863
- I can't breathe. Can't...
- You're okay.

01:18.940 --> 01:20.122
If you can talk,
you can breathe.

01:20.199 --> 01:21.917
- I can't breathe. I can't...
- It's okay. Calm down.

01:21.994 --> 01:23.488
I can't...

01:23.565 --> 01:25.935
Here.
Why don't you take these?

01:26.160 --> 01:27.583
They'll make you
feel better.

01:27.824 --> 01:29.363
I need your thoughts.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.388
I really think you need
to see Princeton.

01:31.465 --> 01:32.886
Well, how am I supposed
to pull that off?

01:32.963 --> 01:34.239
It's all the way
across the country.

01:34.316 --> 01:36.115
I'm gonna take him this week.

01:36.238 --> 01:38.091
If they fire me,
they fire me.

01:38.168 --> 01:39.448
What if I take him?

01:39.525 --> 01:42.285
Uh, we missed our connecting
flight to New York, so...

01:42.362 --> 01:43.697
No, we have no more flights

01:43.774 --> 01:45.169
to New York today.

01:45.496 --> 01:47.415
Cole? What's g...
what's going on?

01:47.715 --> 01:49.896
It's been 72 hours.
No one's seen her.

01:49.973 --> 01:52.162
Police have declared her
a missing person.

Hi, there.

04:44.471 --> 04:45.892
You looking to check in?

04:45.969 --> 04:47.205
Uh, no.

04:47.283 --> 04:51.347
I'm-I'm actually looking for
one of your... um, attendees.

04:52.088 --> 04:53.800
A woman named Alison Bailey.

04:54.406 --> 04:55.938
Think maybe
you could tell me

04:56.015 --> 04:57.566
where she is
right at the moment?

04:58.196 --> 04:59.401
Um...

05:05.499 --> 05:07.276
Oh. Hey.

05:08.143 --> 05:09.594
Yeah. Uh, it looks like

05:09.656 --> 05:11.636
she has not
checked in yet.

05:12.275 --> 05:13.471
Really?

05:13.549 --> 05:15.042
Yeah, so...

05:20.697 --> 05:23.888
Uh... Oh, is this...
this, uh, is this the first day?

05:23.965 --> 05:25.728
No, this is actually day three.

05:28.908 --> 05:30.072
Huh.

05:30.821 --> 05:32.916
Uh, then, thank you.

05:38.065 --> 05:39.673
Hey. Ali, it's me.

05:39.750 --> 05:40.893
Uh, Cole.

05:40.971 --> 05:42.276
I'm...

05:42.903 --> 05:44.791
I'm just, um...

05:47.463 --> 05:49.816
Uh, just... give me
a call when you get this.

05:49.893 --> 05:51.213
Bye.

05:57.288 --> 05:59.089
Hey. Athena, it's Cole.

05:59.166 --> 06:00.964
Um, I'm trying
to get ahold of Ali.

06:01.041 --> 06:02.683
You have any idea
where she might be?

06:03.190 --> 06:05.868
Well, that's strange,

06:05.945 --> 06:08.212
'cause I'm actually in Milwaukee
and she's not here.

06:08.289 --> 06:09.582
She never checked in.

06:11.322 --> 06:13.229
Um...
That's a...

06:13.306 --> 06:14.900
that's a long story,
it doesn't matter,

06:14.977 --> 06:16.577
but, um, I'm just,
I'm just trying

06:16.821 --> 06:18.822
to find her, so...

06:18.899 --> 06:20.445
When?

06:23.070 --> 06:25.739
Three days ago? And you haven't
heard from her since?

06:31.323 --> 06:32.817
Did you call Luisa?

06:40.093 --> 06:41.303
You know what? Um, Athena,

06:41.380 --> 06:42.782
I'm gonna have
to call you right back.

06:42.859 --> 06:44.035
Okay? Really sorry.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.208
Call you right back.
Hey, Ben. Ben!

06:48.078 --> 06:49.244
Hey.

06:49.378 --> 06:51.207
Cole. Lockhart.

06:51.717 --> 06:52.860
Hey.

06:52.938 --> 06:54.093
Hey, Cole.

06:54.171 --> 06:56.040
Um... what, uh...

06:56.272 --> 06:57.739
what are you doing here?

06:57.816 --> 06:58.903
Uh...

07:01.033 --> 07:03.280
I'm looking for Alison,
actually.

07:03.357 --> 07:04.796
Is she...

07:08.505 --> 07:10.781
Are the two of you
here together?

07:12.960 --> 07:14.663
No. Um...

07:14.863 --> 07:18.816
actually, I think, between us,
it's, uh... it's over.

07:20.742 --> 07:22.741
Oh, shit.

07:23.553 --> 07:25.207
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:25.965 --> 07:27.085
Yeah.

07:27.163 --> 07:28.791
Yeah, me, too.

07:30.333 --> 07:31.520
Um...

07:33.237 --> 07:35.165
Mind if I ask what happened?

07:35.921 --> 07:38.739
Well, I, uh,
I told her I was married,

07:38.816 --> 07:41.000
and she wasn't so into that.

07:43.903 --> 07:45.984
Yeah. Sorry.

07:46.264 --> 07:47.641
Ah, it's okay.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.328
You know, we
ended things well.

07:49.405 --> 07:51.929
In a weird way,
I think she felt good about it.

07:52.006 --> 07:54.326
Something about...
standing up for herself.

07:54.403 --> 07:55.488
I don't know.

07:55.565 --> 07:58.469
I kind of stopped listening
after she said we had no future.

07:58.944 --> 08:00.914
Damn.
That's tough.

08:00.991 --> 08:02.531
Yeah. It is what it is.

08:02.608 --> 08:03.826
Anyway, um,

08:03.903 --> 08:05.447
- I-I really...
- Um, you don't,

08:05.524 --> 08:07.828
by any chance,
know where she is, do you?

08:08.584 --> 08:09.928
No. Why?

08:10.077 --> 08:12.875
Well, she's kind of gone MIA.

08:14.507 --> 08:18.062
I mean, she said something
about, uh, going to Los Angeles.

08:18.460 --> 08:19.703
Los Angeles? Why?

08:19.780 --> 08:21.437
Yeah. She, uh,

08:21.655 --> 08:23.482
said she was gonna go
see her ex-husband.

08:23.559 --> 08:24.666
I don't really know.

08:24.780 --> 08:27.422
Listen, um,
I, uh, I gotta prep

08:27.499 --> 08:29.453
for this next workshop.
Veterans. But...

08:30.027 --> 08:32.070
do me a favor.
When you do get ahold of her,

08:32.147 --> 08:34.279
could you just give me a call,
let me know she's all right?

08:34.356 --> 08:35.539
Yeah, of course.

08:35.678 --> 08:36.936
All right.

08:46.749 --> 08:48.775
Hi, this is Noah.
Leave a message.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.303
Solloway.

08:51.483 --> 08:53.227
It's Cole Lockhart.

08:54.237 --> 08:56.197
Look, I'm trying
to track down Alison

08:56.274 --> 08:58.594
and I heard that maybe
she went out to L.A.

08:59.007 --> 09:00.477
She with you?

09:01.268 --> 09:02.863
Call me back when you get this.

09:09.151 --> 09:10.914
Hey, Athena.
I'm sorry about that.

09:11.016 --> 09:13.194
Cole, I went by her house.

09:13.381 --> 09:14.673
With Joanie?

09:14.750 --> 09:18.633
Uh, no, no, no, I dropped
Joanie off with Luisa.

09:20.279 --> 09:21.560
Thank you for doing that.

09:21.637 --> 09:23.242
Her stuff is still here.

09:23.725 --> 09:24.923
What do you mean?

09:25.000 --> 09:28.445
Her phone, her wallet...
It's all on the table.

09:31.725 --> 09:33.053
Cole?

09:33.614 --> 09:35.875
I heard that maybe
she went out to Los Angeles.

09:35.952 --> 09:37.374
Without her phone?

09:37.932 --> 09:39.211
You sure it's hers?

09:39.288 --> 09:41.586
Yes. I'm looking
at it right now.

09:43.342 --> 09:46.344
Maybe she needed
another break, you know?

09:47.014 --> 09:48.186
Yeah.

09:48.264 --> 09:49.820
Yeah, maybe.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.139
Um...

09:53.462 --> 09:56.101
Look, do you mind just
calling around a little bit

09:56.178 --> 09:57.677
and seeing if anybody
knows anything?

09:57.754 --> 09:59.133
Well, of course.

09:59.210 --> 10:02.264
I'm gonna head home now,
I should be back by...

10:06.217 --> 10:08.263
Well... I'll get back
as soon as I can. Okay?

10:08.340 --> 10:09.766
Okay.

10:11.404 --> 10:12.734
- Sh... hey, Athena?
- Oh.

10:12.811 --> 10:13.989
I gotta go.
I gotta take this call.

10:14.066 --> 10:15.896
All right? Just...
call me if you get any info.

10:15.973 --> 10:17.007
Okay, bye.

10:17.264 --> 10:18.452
She with you?

10:18.529 --> 10:19.781
Hello to you, too, Cole.

10:19.858 --> 10:21.578
I just want to know
where she is.

10:21.796 --> 10:23.154
I have no idea, so...

10:24.437 --> 10:26.407
I heard maybe she went
out to Los Angeles.

10:27.186 --> 10:28.619
She did, yeah.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.148
She was here last week.

10:30.307 --> 10:32.250
- And?
- And nothing.

10:32.412 --> 10:34.398
As far as I know,
she went back to Montauk.

10:34.522 --> 10:36.012
As far as you know?

10:36.090 --> 10:37.706
Yeah. She got on a plane...

10:38.240 --> 10:39.739
Look, I'm not even
out there anymore.

10:39.816 --> 10:41.996
I'm in Chicago.
I'm stuck in O'Hare.

10:42.073 --> 10:45.133
Well, it might interest you
to know that nobody can find her.

10:45.452 --> 10:46.821
What?

10:48.345 --> 10:50.425
Did you just say
you're at Chicago O'Hare?

10:50.502 --> 10:52.687
Did you say no one
can find her?

10:57.385 --> 10:59.021
Cole.

11:00.166 --> 11:01.592
Cole?

11:02.984 --> 11:04.725
Cole?

11:05.580 --> 11:07.750
If I came and picked you up,
would you drive?

11:08.099 --> 11:09.459
Drive? Where?

11:09.536 --> 11:10.903
Home.

11:11.241 --> 11:14.207
I'm exhausted, I can't
make the trip by myself.

11:14.546 --> 11:17.336
I'll drop you off
anywhere you want along the way.

11:20.508 --> 11:21.944
Noah?

11:22.616 --> 11:25.750
Uh... Okay, sure.

11:28.233 --> 11:30.359
Stay where you are.
I'll be there soon.

12:16.023 --> 12:17.499
Thanks for picking us up.

12:17.851 --> 12:18.904
Us?

12:18.982 --> 12:20.168
Hey.

12:20.245 --> 12:21.568
Anton.

12:23.999 --> 12:26.305
It's a long story.
I'll explain.

12:27.026 --> 12:28.359
Thanks.

12:29.536 --> 12:31.798
So she hasn't called?

12:32.382 --> 12:33.821
No.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.862
Fuck.

13:03.822 --> 13:05.030
You want to get that?

13:05.107 --> 13:06.753
I'll grab you something.

13:07.088 --> 13:08.393
Thank you.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.957
Hey, Luisa. How are you?

13:17.487 --> 13:18.697
No, I'm-I'm fine.

13:18.774 --> 13:20.070
Thank you.

13:20.153 --> 13:21.582
Yeah, I'm good.

13:21.836 --> 13:23.513
How's Joanie doing?

13:26.696 --> 13:28.312
Good.

13:30.354 --> 13:32.265
Yeah, I'm on my way.
I'll be...

13:32.529 --> 13:34.445
I'll be home soon.

13:37.255 --> 13:38.447
You know what's going on.

13:38.524 --> 13:39.654
Alison's missing.

13:39.731 --> 13:41.500
I'm trying to find her.

13:43.709 --> 13:45.545
No...

13:45.979 --> 13:47.990
I know that's not
what you meant...

13:48.655 --> 13:49.756
Luisa, please,

13:49.833 --> 13:52.031
I can't get into us right now.
Please.

13:52.937 --> 13:56.390
We will talk about that
as soon as I get home, okay?

13:57.303 --> 13:58.493
Yes, I promise.

13:58.570 --> 14:00.072
I'll tell you everything
that's going on with me.

14:00.149 --> 14:01.656
I just cannot get into it
right now.

14:01.733 --> 14:03.084
Please.

14:03.833 --> 14:05.840
No, no. No, please don't
put her...

14:07.571 --> 14:10.117
Hey, baby. How are you?

14:10.404 --> 14:13.211
What are you doing up so late?
Shouldn't you be in bed already?

14:15.279 --> 14:17.929
I will be home soon, I promise.

14:19.038 --> 14:20.288
No.

14:20.439 --> 14:22.242
No, Mommy's just gone
on a little trip.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.411
That's where I'm going
right now.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.695
I'm going to go get her. Okay?

14:26.445 --> 14:28.500
Yes, I will be home soon.

14:29.241 --> 14:30.929
That's right,
we will be home soon.

14:31.115 --> 14:32.547
That's exactly right.

14:32.913 --> 14:35.476
Everything's gonna be okay,
I promise.

14:37.389 --> 14:40.859
Okay, you go to bed now.
And brush your teeth.

14:41.311 --> 14:42.725
Promise?

14:45.108 --> 14:46.640
I love you, too, kiddo.

14:52.527 --> 14:54.445
Oh, fuck.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.064
Hey.

15:00.971 --> 15:02.512
Thank you.

15:27.696 --> 15:29.992
Hey. Athena?
What's the news?

15:30.069 --> 15:32.000
I know where she may be.

15:32.380 --> 15:34.701
Oh. Great. Where?

15:34.778 --> 15:36.211
<i>Her father's.</i>

15:36.332 --> 15:37.506
Her what?

15:37.584 --> 15:38.958
<i>He reached out
to her last week.</i>

15:39.035 --> 15:41.072
- <i>He wants her kidney.</i>
- He wants her what?

15:41.149 --> 15:42.169
<i>She went to see him.</i>

15:42.246 --> 15:44.351
Okay, Athena,
s-slow down for a second.

15:44.428 --> 15:45.617
<i>He lives in East Hampton.</i>

15:45.694 --> 15:47.474
Alison's father lives
in East Hampton?

15:47.551 --> 15:48.583
<i>Yes.</i>

15:48.660 --> 15:50.202
<i>Okay, I just talked to him,</i>

15:50.279 --> 15:52.410
<i>but he insists he hasn't
seen her since she left.</i>

15:52.487 --> 15:54.916
<i>But he's a terrible person,
Cole, and I don't trust him.</i>

15:54.993 --> 15:56.740
- Athena.
<i>- Who's that?</i>

15:56.817 --> 15:59.667
It's Noah. Noah Solloway.

15:59.748 --> 16:01.810
<i>What? What are you two
doing together?</i>

16:01.887 --> 16:03.195
It's a long story.

16:03.272 --> 16:05.671
How did Alison find out
about her father?

16:05.748 --> 16:07.187
- <i>He called me.</i>
- He called you?

16:07.264 --> 16:08.388
And you just
sent her to him?

16:08.465 --> 16:10.168
No! Of course not.

16:10.701 --> 16:13.322
- <i>I didn't know she'd gone</i>.
- You knew where he was?

16:13.399 --> 16:15.624
- When did she see him?
- Last week.

16:15.932 --> 16:18.826
Is there any good reason
in God's name

16:18.903 --> 16:21.113
why you are just
mentioning this now?

16:24.526 --> 16:25.862
Athena?!

16:26.362 --> 16:28.910
<i>There's a reason, Cole,
but I'd rather not discuss it.</i>

16:28.987 --> 16:30.947
I don't give a shit
what you'd rather not discuss.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.238
<i>It's not relevant, Cole, okay?</i>

16:33.315 --> 16:35.224
<i>What's important is
I don't trust him.</i>

16:35.301 --> 16:36.654
<i>And someone needs
to talk to him.</i>

16:36.731 --> 16:38.865
Alison's father has been
living in East Hampton

16:38.942 --> 16:41.610
for her entire life,
20 miles away, and you're just

16:41.687 --> 16:42.897
- telling me this now?!
- <i>Cole...</i>

16:42.974 --> 16:44.428
Look, what's the address?
Just-just...

16:44.505 --> 16:46.649
Just give us
the address, Athena.

16:46.945 --> 16:49.409
<i>42 Lee Avenue, East Hampton.</i>

16:49.486 --> 16:50.529
Got that?

16:50.612 --> 16:52.927
Great. Thanks, Athena.

16:53.112 --> 16:55.261
Oh, my God, this would
be so much easier

16:55.338 --> 16:57.466
if she wasn't
such a fucking nut job.

16:58.445 --> 17:00.581
Did Alison mention any of this
when she came out to see you?

17:00.658 --> 17:02.067
No, not a word.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.722
Nothing?

17:06.487 --> 17:08.903
Look, Cole, there's something else
I should tell you.

17:09.363 --> 17:10.699
What?

17:10.777 --> 17:13.761
When I picked up Alison in L.A.,
she was in bad shape, okay?

17:13.838 --> 17:14.905
Really bad shape.

17:14.982 --> 17:18.098
So I-I got her
a prescription for Xanax.

17:18.509 --> 17:21.117
- Please tell me that's a joke.
- No, well, I didn't, Vik did.

17:21.194 --> 17:22.252
- Helen's boyfriend.
- Oh, my God.

17:22.329 --> 17:23.962
- You gave her a bottle of Xanax?
- She was having...

17:24.039 --> 17:25.381
She was having some kind
of a panic attack.

17:25.458 --> 17:28.215
Well, actually, Xanax isn't
that strong of a drug.

17:28.371 --> 17:30.106
You can't O.D. on it

17:30.183 --> 17:31.354
unless you, like,
mix it with alcohol.

17:31.431 --> 17:32.489
Thanks, Anton.

17:32.566 --> 17:34.739
What was she planning on doing,
relaxing herself to death?

17:34.816 --> 17:36.200
All right,
that's enough.

17:36.277 --> 17:38.419
Sorry, The point is,
I didn't tell Jeffries,

17:38.496 --> 17:39.980
and he's gonna find out.

17:40.322 --> 17:41.557
Hey, wait!

17:41.634 --> 17:42.442
- Whoa!
- Wait!

17:42.519 --> 17:43.643
What the fuck
are you doing?!

17:43.720 --> 17:45.565
- Cole, keep your eyes on the road!
- Man, I'm fine!

17:45.642 --> 17:48.927
- How long you been awake?
- I said I'm fine.

17:50.487 --> 17:51.667
Here, look.
There's an exit here.

17:51.744 --> 17:52.918
Pull over.

17:52.996 --> 17:54.614
Come on, pull over.

18:17.404 --> 18:19.028
Hi.

18:21.070 --> 18:22.302
Hi.

18:22.497 --> 18:25.327
Hi yourself.

18:25.404 --> 18:28.099
Would you have a couple
of rooms, maybe adjoining?

18:29.472 --> 18:30.696
Dad?

18:30.808 --> 18:33.028
Do we have
two adjoining?

18:33.105 --> 18:34.656
They don't have to be adjoining.

18:34.733 --> 18:36.447
Yeah, hold on one second.

18:36.524 --> 18:38.028
Uh...

18:39.871 --> 18:41.504
Yeah, no.

18:47.404 --> 18:50.452
Just... hang on.

18:50.529 --> 18:52.888
Because we are
pretty full tonight,

18:52.987 --> 18:54.947
but let me see
what I can do.

18:56.745 --> 19:00.161
How about a double queen
for your son,

19:00.410 --> 19:03.435
which adjoins with
a single king for you guys.

19:04.488 --> 19:06.513
Does that work for your family?

19:08.511 --> 19:10.504
Because love is love.

19:10.830 --> 19:12.497
Thank you.
That would be perfect.

19:12.574 --> 19:14.026
Thank you.
Rebecca, you're a doll.

19:14.103 --> 19:16.123
- Thank you.
- No problem.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.692
Okay. Grab you a key.

19:58.374 --> 19:59.423
<i>You've reached Ben.</i>

19:59.500 --> 20:00.656
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

20:00.811 --> 20:01.948
Hey.

20:02.025 --> 20:04.453
Ben, it's, uh,
Cole Lockhart calling.

20:04.530 --> 20:08.419
I just wanted to...
well, I wanted to check in,

20:08.496 --> 20:09.739
see if maybe you'd
heard from Alison.

20:09.816 --> 20:13.052
So, if you do hear anything,
give me a call back.

20:13.332 --> 20:14.660
Thank you.

20:19.947 --> 20:21.625
We're hungry.

20:24.172 --> 20:25.474
Need anything else?

20:25.676 --> 20:27.197
No, that was delicious.
Thank you.

20:27.274 --> 20:28.685
How about the hubby?

20:30.021 --> 20:31.824
Oh, no, he's good, too.

20:37.254 --> 20:40.248
Quit macking on her.
Eat your food.

20:40.325 --> 20:42.540
- "Macking"?
- Yeah?

20:42.847 --> 20:44.695
1991 called...

20:44.772 --> 20:47.589
on a landline, asking you
to fax its slang back.

20:48.945 --> 20:50.405
Seriously, when you've
had your dinner,

20:50.482 --> 20:54.139
I can, uh... give you
a few pointers if you like.

20:54.216 --> 20:56.885
- Pointers?
- You know, on sealing the deal.

20:56.962 --> 20:58.315
I'm good, thank you.

20:58.392 --> 20:59.660
No.

20:59.737 --> 21:01.207
Please. I want to hear this.

21:01.284 --> 21:02.841
I bet you would.

21:03.824 --> 21:05.261
See, they say
the best advice

21:05.338 --> 21:07.458
is to be yourself,
but I think

21:07.535 --> 21:10.921
it's-it's good to enhance your
natural personality, you know?

21:13.019 --> 21:15.697
See, Cole, for instance,
he's a moper.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.020
I'm a what?

21:17.097 --> 21:18.457
- Oh, shit.
- A moper.

21:18.840 --> 21:19.988
I am not a moper.

21:20.065 --> 21:22.223
You are. Classic moper.

21:22.300 --> 21:26.603
See, his thing is... is to belly
up to the bar and order a drink,

21:26.773 --> 21:28.143
like, you know,
really seriously,

21:28.220 --> 21:30.395
like he's ordering
a missile strike,

21:30.472 --> 21:32.309
and then just stare
into the glass

21:32.386 --> 21:35.138
really, really intense,
like he's reading tea leaves,

21:35.215 --> 21:36.651
like he can see
the future in there.

21:36.728 --> 21:37.740
Before you know it,

21:37.817 --> 21:39.378
women are falling
all over themselves

21:39.455 --> 21:40.927
to come and cheer him up.

21:41.004 --> 21:42.386
- Isn't that right?
- Wow.

21:42.463 --> 21:45.184
Mm, mm. Now,
Noah's strategy,

21:45.261 --> 21:46.823
- on the other hand...
- Yes. Do tell.

21:46.900 --> 21:48.065
I've been wondering
about this.

21:48.142 --> 21:50.263
Is to make
all of these promises

21:50.340 --> 21:52.059
he has no intention of keeping

21:52.136 --> 21:54.073
and couldn't possibly
deliver on, but that's okay,

21:54.150 --> 21:56.185
so long as he gets
what he wants.

21:56.663 --> 21:57.955
Right?

22:00.699 --> 22:03.333
Seriously, though,
she's a smart girl,

22:03.433 --> 22:04.716
probably totally bored,

22:04.793 --> 22:05.981
living in a
Podunk town.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.690
She'd really welcome
talking to someone

22:07.767 --> 22:08.818
with a bigger
perspective.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.865
Or maybe she's chosen
to live here

22:10.942 --> 22:12.645
for reasons you couldn't
possibly understand,

22:12.722 --> 22:14.253
and she doesn't need
some fucking stranger

22:14.330 --> 22:16.556
coming into town and ruining
her life by rescuing her

22:16.633 --> 22:18.586
from choices that she's made
as a grown woman.

22:18.663 --> 22:19.870
All right.

22:20.032 --> 22:22.634
Thank you, guys, for the wisdom.

22:22.711 --> 22:24.775
I think I got it
from here, though.

22:42.942 --> 22:44.877
- Did you just...?
- Yeah.

22:44.954 --> 22:47.002
I got her number
back at the desk.

22:48.985 --> 22:50.913
- Excuse me.
- Geez.

22:52.567 --> 22:55.330
Mr. Lockhart.
Mr. Solloway.

23:04.415 --> 23:06.343
How exactly
do you know this kid?

23:07.218 --> 23:08.711
It's complicated.

23:10.219 --> 23:11.746
Yeah, I bet.

23:11.844 --> 23:14.919
Let me guess.
You're fucking his mother.

23:34.811 --> 23:36.760
I've been sexiled.

23:37.477 --> 23:38.571
What?

23:38.829 --> 23:41.299
Isn't that what you called it
in college? Sexiled?

23:42.942 --> 23:45.478
I never went to college.

23:58.532 --> 24:00.642
Yes! Yes!

24:01.297 --> 24:04.078
How old is this kid, 18, 19?

24:04.390 --> 24:06.484
Where is he getting
this control from?

24:06.561 --> 24:07.817
I know.

24:08.391 --> 24:10.865
I actually think he might just
be punking us at this point.

24:14.883 --> 24:17.078
- Is that ours?
- No.

24:20.461 --> 24:21.818
Rebecca,
open this door right now!

24:21.895 --> 24:23.365
- I know you're in there!
- Oh, shit.

24:23.442 --> 24:24.777
- Uh, just a second!
- It's the dad. Hey.

24:26.020 --> 24:28.698
Come here, come here.

24:28.775 --> 24:30.001
Oh, my God.

24:30.565 --> 24:32.860
- Rebecca!
- Get in here, sit there.

24:34.866 --> 24:36.109
- Put your clothes on.
- Rebecca!

24:36.187 --> 24:38.004
Open this door right now!

24:39.073 --> 24:40.109
Where is he?

24:40.186 --> 24:41.673
- Where the fuck is he?!
- I don't know

24:41.750 --> 24:43.782
what you're talking about.
I was just cleaning this room.

24:43.859 --> 24:46.253
At midnight?!
You think I'm fucking stupid,

24:46.330 --> 24:47.573
- you little slut?!
- Fuck you!

24:47.650 --> 24:48.777
I'll deal with you later.

24:52.692 --> 24:55.308
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Go back, go back, go back.

24:57.205 --> 24:58.787
Open up, you fucking faggots!

25:03.924 --> 25:05.964
Excuse me, what are
you doing in our room?

25:06.041 --> 25:07.118
And what's with
all the yelling?

25:07.195 --> 25:08.688
What the fuck you three
think you're doing

25:08.765 --> 25:10.651
in my motel with my daughter?

25:13.852 --> 25:18.729
I don't know about your
daughter, but my husband and I

25:18.806 --> 25:20.181
are just trying
to take our son

25:20.258 --> 25:21.956
to see some schools
on the East Coast.

25:22.150 --> 25:24.409
And if you don't get out of
this fucking room right now,

25:24.486 --> 25:25.790
I'm gonna kick your teeth
down your throat,

25:25.867 --> 25:26.777
you fucking redneck.

25:26.854 --> 25:28.709
Uh, honey, honey,
honey, honey, honey.

25:28.853 --> 25:30.930
I think may-maybe
we should just leave.

25:31.007 --> 25:32.817
Let's leave. We'll leave.

25:32.894 --> 25:34.612
That's a real good idea.

26:06.321 --> 26:07.833
So, Noah...

26:09.619 --> 26:11.275
Yeah?

26:12.689 --> 26:15.412
Why did Alison go
out to Los Angeles?

26:18.967 --> 26:20.878
I'm not really sure.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.667
I never understood
why she did what she did.

26:38.022 --> 26:39.612
Did you fuck her?

26:42.650 --> 26:43.970
No.

26:45.392 --> 26:48.258
There's nothing
left between us.

26:48.335 --> 26:49.361
I mean,

26:49.439 --> 26:51.383
I'll always love her,
but I don't want to be with her

26:51.460 --> 26:53.464
and she doesn't want
to be with me.

26:55.157 --> 26:57.651
It was all over a long time ago.

27:01.586 --> 27:03.292
What about you?

27:05.181 --> 27:06.823
What about me?

27:08.014 --> 27:09.893
You want to be
with her again?

27:11.259 --> 27:13.214
That why you went to Milwaukee?

27:14.860 --> 27:16.427
To get her back?

27:36.415 --> 27:39.252
This state is endless.

27:46.245 --> 27:47.501
Morning.

27:48.475 --> 27:49.881
Morning.

27:51.138 --> 27:52.843
Oh, man.

27:57.058 --> 27:58.867
How long you been
driving for?

27:58.944 --> 28:00.281
Couple hours.

28:00.405 --> 28:03.078
<i>♪ Your man has had
his time... ♪</i>

28:05.264 --> 28:06.614
Nope.

28:07.223 --> 28:08.264
Here.

28:08.475 --> 28:09.530
Thank you.

28:17.303 --> 28:18.775
Oh, man.

28:19.194 --> 28:21.234
I can take over
at the next truck stop.

28:21.423 --> 28:22.733
I'm good.

28:24.850 --> 28:26.942
What the fuck
are we listening to?

28:27.019 --> 28:28.503
Metallica.

28:30.850 --> 28:32.227
What?

28:32.397 --> 28:34.740
College white boys can
lose their mind over hip-hop,

28:34.817 --> 28:36.115
I can't listen to metal?

28:44.036 --> 28:46.812
- <i>♪ Stop breathing... ♪</i>
- So Princeton?

28:48.100 --> 28:49.179
Hmm.

28:49.257 --> 28:50.969
Aiming low, eh?

28:51.048 --> 28:52.180
Yeah.

28:52.477 --> 28:54.414
That's what they tell me.

28:54.811 --> 28:56.656
You excited to go see it?

28:58.559 --> 29:00.078
I don't know.

29:00.756 --> 29:04.724
<i>♪ All feelings
you terminate for me... ♪</i>

29:04.801 --> 29:06.578
You ever feel like

29:07.699 --> 29:10.302
someone else's feelings
about something are so loud

29:10.379 --> 29:12.353
that you can't even
hear your own?

29:15.732 --> 29:17.163
Yes, I do.

29:18.073 --> 29:19.522
Yeah.

29:23.933 --> 29:27.130
So, Noah,
or "Mr. Solloway."

29:27.207 --> 29:28.233
Hmm.

29:28.311 --> 29:30.265
- He's your teacher?
- Yep.

29:31.132 --> 29:32.781
He any good?

29:36.926 --> 29:38.844
He's fucking great, actually.

29:41.143 --> 29:42.576
Hmm.

29:51.934 --> 29:53.966
Cole, what's wrong?

29:54.194 --> 29:56.989
I'm not gonna be able to take
you all the way to Princeton.

29:57.097 --> 29:58.505
I want to go talk
to Alison's dad.

29:58.582 --> 30:00.583
Its just gonna be faster
if I take 78 the whole way.

30:00.660 --> 30:02.362
Okay, fine. Don't worry,
we'll just get a cab

30:02.439 --> 30:04.182
- from here if you want.
- Well, technically,

30:04.259 --> 30:06.249
we don't have to be there
until tomorrow, right?

30:08.405 --> 30:10.293
No, technically, no,
but I want to

30:10.370 --> 30:11.877
get you there early,
so you can walk around,

30:11.954 --> 30:13.573
- visit a class.
- Yeah, or

30:13.650 --> 30:15.301
we can keep helping Cole

30:15.378 --> 30:16.966
look for y'all's
missing ex-wife.

30:17.235 --> 30:20.065
This is not a fun adventure,
Anton, it's serious.

30:20.142 --> 30:21.607
Yes, Mr. Solloway, I know.

30:21.684 --> 30:23.044
That's why I want to stay.

30:23.527 --> 30:25.192
Look, you know

30:25.269 --> 30:27.221
you're not gonna be able to
think about anything else.

30:27.298 --> 30:30.121
So instead of staying
at Princeton for an extra day

30:30.198 --> 30:32.028
doing jack shit
while you check your phone

30:32.105 --> 30:34.567
every ten seconds,
we can stay with Mr. Lockhart.

30:34.644 --> 30:36.192
See if we can help.

30:38.378 --> 30:40.010
Well, that's true,
I'm not gonna be able to think about

30:40.087 --> 30:41.934
- anything else.
- Exactly.

30:42.495 --> 30:44.106
Plus, I'm invested now.

30:44.183 --> 30:46.505
Don't you want to teach me
to follow through?

30:47.204 --> 30:48.663
Come on.

30:48.753 --> 30:50.086
Okay.

31:39.566 --> 31:40.858
Damn.

31:40.980 --> 31:42.505
Y'all are rich.

31:42.798 --> 31:44.864
It's not my house.

31:49.782 --> 31:53.044
I meant, like,
the collective y'all.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.769
What?

31:57.756 --> 31:59.205
Look, I don't know
these people,

31:59.282 --> 32:01.258
so just...
follow my lead, all right?

32:01.335 --> 32:02.730
Crazy.

32:06.597 --> 32:09.067
We were just
getting lunch together.

32:09.144 --> 32:11.043
Uh, should I put down
a couple of extra plates?

32:11.120 --> 32:12.807
- No, that's fine.
- Oh, yeah, that would be lovely,

32:12.884 --> 32:13.809
- thank you.
- Okay.

32:13.886 --> 32:15.370
And, again,
sorry to barge in on you.

32:15.447 --> 32:17.006
Oh, I understand.

32:17.083 --> 32:19.096
You must be worried sick
about her.

32:19.263 --> 32:22.661
I-I mean, I don't know if
James knows anything, but, um,

32:22.738 --> 32:24.365
regardless, I'm sure
he'd like to help.

32:24.442 --> 32:25.856
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

32:26.715 --> 32:27.965
Hey.

32:28.042 --> 32:29.487
We're just trying to find out
where she is.

32:29.564 --> 32:30.666
Now you want
to stay for lunch?

32:30.743 --> 32:33.412
People like this, the more
hospitality you accept,

32:33.489 --> 32:35.036
the more they open up.

32:38.410 --> 32:39.784
James?

32:39.861 --> 32:43.002
Honey, um, we've got company.

32:44.285 --> 32:46.052
Yes,

32:46.260 --> 32:48.174
well, I'll... just be a moment.

32:48.251 --> 32:49.464
As you can see,

32:49.845 --> 32:51.746
I'm otherwise engaged.

32:51.823 --> 32:52.986
All right, guys.

32:53.063 --> 32:54.677
Come on, headphones off.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.489
Cell phones
in the basket.

32:57.550 --> 32:58.863
Thank you.

32:58.941 --> 33:01.583
Thank you.
You, too.

33:02.067 --> 33:04.044
It's a rule here.

33:04.464 --> 33:05.942
Great. Yes.

33:06.019 --> 33:08.528
Meals are a time
for human connection.

33:09.167 --> 33:10.606
Oh, uh, Anton,

33:10.683 --> 33:12.716
is there anything
you don't eat?

33:13.095 --> 33:16.268
Our chef made baby octopus
for lunch, and, um,

33:16.345 --> 33:18.778
well, I'm...
It's not for everyone.

33:19.534 --> 33:21.341
Perhaps a grilled cheese?

33:21.910 --> 33:23.864
No, I pretty much
eat anything.

33:24.021 --> 33:25.560
But I could use
your shower, though.

33:25.637 --> 33:27.476
We've been driving
for, like,

33:27.553 --> 33:29.542
a day and a half and I don't
really smell too good right now.

33:29.619 --> 33:30.925
So...

33:31.319 --> 33:33.458
Of course.
Uh, Tessa can

33:33.535 --> 33:35.425
show you to
the guest shower

33:35.502 --> 33:36.798
upstairs.

33:38.889 --> 33:39.973
Anyway,
we were just hoping

33:40.050 --> 33:40.924
you might have
heard from her

33:41.001 --> 33:42.911
since you've just been
reacquainted.

33:42.988 --> 33:44.330
I'm sure rebuilding
that relationship

33:44.407 --> 33:45.580
was very important
to her and...

33:45.657 --> 33:47.075
Mm. Mm-hmm.

33:47.152 --> 33:48.958
I mean, we even thought
maybe she was...

33:49.167 --> 33:51.247
maybe she was here.

33:51.324 --> 33:52.737
No, no, she is not here.

33:52.814 --> 33:54.815
I mean, it is a big house,
but...

33:55.002 --> 33:56.903
it's not that big.

33:57.085 --> 33:58.455
And the last time
I heard from her,

33:58.532 --> 34:00.408
well, I, I think
it must have been

34:00.485 --> 34:03.783
before you said she went
to Los Angeles, so... sorry,

34:03.860 --> 34:05.110
I know
that's no help.

34:05.187 --> 34:06.825
No,
that's fine, it's just...

34:07.288 --> 34:09.065
is there anything else
you can think of?

34:09.177 --> 34:11.554
Anything she might have said
or was planning or...?

34:13.120 --> 34:15.453
How do you know she's not just

34:15.690 --> 34:18.274
having one of those
little episodes of hers?

34:18.687 --> 34:20.149
I'm sorry, what?

34:20.226 --> 34:21.833
It's, it's just
an expression, Cole.

34:21.911 --> 34:23.951
Well, I-I don't know
exactly what to call it,

34:24.027 --> 34:27.032
but she did do this sort of
thing every once in a while, no?

34:27.741 --> 34:29.672
And how would you know that?

34:30.507 --> 34:32.703
We spoke, Cole.

34:32.780 --> 34:34.085
We got to know each other.

34:34.163 --> 34:37.978
While this behavior
worries me, well, I must say

34:38.056 --> 34:39.672
I'm not surprised.

34:39.925 --> 34:41.702
So, well, I do think
she'll turn up,

34:41.779 --> 34:44.016
but I think we just must
have a little patience.

34:44.092 --> 34:46.804
You had 40 years
to get to know her.

34:46.882 --> 34:48.942
And you never reached
out to her even once

34:49.018 --> 34:50.389
until you needed her organ.

34:50.467 --> 34:52.434
And now you have the audacity

34:52.511 --> 34:56.438
to sit there and...
She is a stranger to you.

34:57.304 --> 35:00.045
I'm going to see if your friend
got lost on his way back

35:00.122 --> 35:01.451
from the shower.

35:01.528 --> 35:02.949
Excuse me.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.516
I'm not sure what it
is you want me to say.

35:10.728 --> 35:12.367
I don't want you
to say anything.

35:12.444 --> 35:15.334
I want you to understand the
hole that you left in her life.

35:15.411 --> 35:17.267
She blamed herself, you know?

35:17.344 --> 35:18.648
She thought you disappeared

35:18.725 --> 35:20.114
because she wasn't
good enough for you.

35:20.191 --> 35:22.656
There are many things
that I regret.

35:22.733 --> 35:24.584
But when you get to be
my age, my friend,

35:24.661 --> 35:27.647
I think you will find yourself
viewing other people's choices

35:27.724 --> 35:29.128
more charitably.

35:29.205 --> 35:32.787
No, I did not do well by my
daughter when I was young.

35:32.864 --> 35:35.883
But now I am hoping to
make up for lost time.

35:35.960 --> 35:38.203
That's not how it works.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.429
You don't get a-a do-over.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.412
Just show up and hope that
you can undo everything.

35:42.489 --> 35:43.582
I mean...

35:44.114 --> 35:46.047
Oh, you poor kid.

35:46.188 --> 35:49.235
Now I understand
what you're doing here.

35:49.455 --> 35:50.733
Really?

35:50.811 --> 35:52.281
What am I doing here?

35:52.500 --> 35:55.054
You're just looking
for someone to blame.

35:55.284 --> 35:56.490
James?

35:56.567 --> 35:58.405
- Darling?
- Yeah.

35:58.482 --> 36:00.680
Darling, I think
you should take this.

36:03.233 --> 36:04.890
Pardon me.

36:17.589 --> 36:18.877
What are you doing?

36:18.954 --> 36:20.215
What am I doing?

36:20.292 --> 36:21.846
What are you doing,
kissing this guy's ass?

36:21.923 --> 36:23.739
I told you, I'm trying
to get information.

36:24.144 --> 36:25.823
You're treating him
like he's on trial.

36:25.900 --> 36:27.375
Well, maybe he should be.

36:27.977 --> 36:30.333
Is there anything else
we can do for you two?

36:32.272 --> 36:33.637
Oh, God.

36:34.925 --> 36:36.674
- James?
- Are you sure?

36:36.751 --> 36:39.223
James,
is everything all right?

36:49.652 --> 36:51.528
That was Athena.

36:53.697 --> 36:55.184
They found her.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.652
They've...

36:59.608 --> 37:01.684
found her body.

37:03.269 --> 37:05.325
She drowned herself.

37:06.302 --> 37:08.028
She's dead.

37:13.035 --> 37:14.323
Yo, yo, that was like

37:14.400 --> 37:16.625
the greatest shower
I've ever taken.

37:49.715 --> 37:51.895
You sure you don't want
to wait in the car?

37:53.579 --> 37:55.145
No, I'm good.

38:02.251 --> 38:03.668
Hi. I'm Sarah.

38:03.745 --> 38:05.799
I'm the crisis counselor here.

38:06.839 --> 38:10.567
Um, which of you is the closest
relative of the deceased?

38:15.844 --> 38:18.776
Which of you will be
identifying her?

38:18.853 --> 38:21.098
Me. Me. I'll do it.

38:25.886 --> 38:27.619
This folder
contains photographs,

38:27.696 --> 38:31.255
visible in which are several of
Ms. Bailey's identifying marks.

38:31.631 --> 38:34.507
I do have to warn you that
she was found underwater

38:34.584 --> 38:36.637
and had been submerged
for several days.

38:36.714 --> 38:38.790
And though we've tried
to conceal as much

38:38.867 --> 38:42.153
of her appearance as possible,
it still may come as a shock.

38:42.914 --> 38:44.509
There's no rush.

38:44.889 --> 38:46.583
Take as much time as you need.

39:04.269 --> 39:05.534
Maybe I should...

39:05.611 --> 39:06.784
Can I see her?

39:06.861 --> 39:08.528
What?

39:09.977 --> 39:11.677
Can I see her?

39:14.255 --> 39:16.723
Not a photo.
Actually go see her.

39:16.800 --> 39:20.134
Um, that's not really something
we do anymore.

39:20.211 --> 39:22.514
The photographs
are much less upsetting.

39:23.636 --> 39:25.058
Please.

40:14.881 --> 40:16.317
- You don't have to do this.
- No.

40:16.394 --> 40:17.833
You can just
look at the pictures.

40:18.047 --> 40:19.214
No.

40:19.360 --> 40:20.590
Cole.

40:20.667 --> 40:22.996
No! We need to see
that it's the real her.

40:23.073 --> 40:25.339
Okay, but look at you.
You're a mess.

40:30.506 --> 40:31.808
You do it.

40:33.511 --> 40:35.309
What? No. I...

40:35.423 --> 40:37.518
You do it.
I can't go in there.

40:38.092 --> 40:39.901
We need to know
that it's her though.

40:39.978 --> 40:42.692
Not a picture,
not a fucking identifying mark.

40:42.769 --> 40:45.005
We need to know
that it's the real her.

40:57.649 --> 40:59.097
All right.

42:45.715 --> 42:47.481
So you'll meet us there?

42:47.558 --> 42:49.182
Yeah. This is the east jetty,

42:49.259 --> 42:51.052
the one by Gin Beach.

42:51.214 --> 42:52.919
Do you know
what he's talking about?

42:54.181 --> 42:55.981
Okay, we're on our way.

43:07.909 --> 43:10.046
It was Ben.

43:12.196 --> 43:13.407
What?

43:13.485 --> 43:15.776
- What's Ben?
- Ben killed her.

43:17.469 --> 43:19.997
Cole, you heard
what they said.

43:20.074 --> 43:21.375
They're ruling
it a suicide.

43:21.452 --> 43:22.579
But they're wrong.

43:22.656 --> 43:25.823
Listen. You didn't
see her in California.

43:27.736 --> 43:29.815
She was at the end
of her rope.

43:56.321 --> 43:58.096
This where you found her?

43:58.217 --> 44:00.408
Well, we didn't find her,
the maintenance guy did,

44:00.485 --> 44:01.805
but this is where
we pulled her out, yeah.

44:01.882 --> 44:03.148
Can I have his name?

44:03.259 --> 44:05.266
I... If you want.

44:05.343 --> 44:06.885
Uh, anyway,
from the looks of things,

44:06.962 --> 44:08.243
she came out here
a couple of days ago,

44:08.320 --> 44:10.467
probably during the storm,
nobody else out here,

44:10.544 --> 44:12.034
visibility for shit.

44:12.111 --> 44:15.292
She walked up to the edge
and-and jumped in.

44:15.664 --> 44:17.570
The waves were so big,
she probably knocked out

44:17.647 --> 44:18.995
against these rocks
pretty quick.

44:19.072 --> 44:21.336
After that, it was just a matter
of time till she drowned.

44:21.413 --> 44:23.914
- How'd she get out here?
- How did she...?

44:23.991 --> 44:25.940
Did you find anything?
Her bike, her car?

44:26.017 --> 44:27.356
We think
she walked, Cole.

44:27.433 --> 44:28.958
I mean, it's not
that far from her condo.

44:29.035 --> 44:30.260
In the middle of a storm?

44:30.451 --> 44:32.128
In that state of mind?

44:32.308 --> 44:34.271
Look, Cole's wondering
if it's possible

44:34.348 --> 44:36.821
she was killed
someplace else, and then...

44:36.898 --> 44:37.884
No.

44:37.962 --> 44:40.180
We-we considered that.
There was water in her lungs.

44:40.257 --> 44:41.753
She drowned.

44:41.974 --> 44:44.963
Well, okay, but I saw her,
and she was pretty beat up.

44:45.040 --> 44:46.672
- She had... her head was...
- Lacerations.

44:46.749 --> 44:49.026
Right, all consistent with
striking against these rocks.

44:49.103 --> 44:50.635
Look, there was no signs
of struggle here.

44:50.712 --> 44:52.351
Uh, there were no signs
of struggle at her place.

44:52.428 --> 44:54.228
I-In fact,
she left it immaculate.

44:54.305 --> 44:56.442
And she left everything,
her wallet, her phone.

44:56.519 --> 44:57.674
She even...

44:57.751 --> 44:59.197
Even what?

45:01.501 --> 45:04.104
She moved most of her money
into a new account.

45:04.289 --> 45:05.425
For Joanie.

45:05.502 --> 45:07.643
- When?
- A week ago.

45:07.995 --> 45:09.914
Look, this isn't
my first rodeo,

45:09.991 --> 45:11.190
unfortunately.

45:11.267 --> 45:12.391
I've seen this before.

45:12.468 --> 45:15.151
She was... getting ready.

45:15.409 --> 45:16.618
What about Ben?

45:16.695 --> 45:17.883
Have you talked to him?

45:17.960 --> 45:19.935
We have, yes.
He has an alibi.

45:20.183 --> 45:21.823
Really? What is it?

45:22.574 --> 45:23.633
It checks out.

45:23.710 --> 45:25.893
- What is it?
- It checks out.

45:29.353 --> 45:31.026
Look, I-I never said this,

45:31.103 --> 45:32.981
but one of the first times
I talked to Ms. Bailey,

45:33.058 --> 45:35.221
back when I was
investigating your...

45:37.694 --> 45:39.964
She said she'd try
to make it to 35.

45:40.674 --> 45:42.300
To live to be 35.

45:42.514 --> 45:43.925
You understand?

45:44.048 --> 45:45.588
And she said
if she made it that far,

45:45.665 --> 45:47.307
but didn't feel any better,

45:47.658 --> 45:49.971
well, then,
she'd have tried hard enough.

45:53.481 --> 45:56.012
- So?
- I don't buy it.

45:56.089 --> 45:58.167
The man had an alibi, Cole.

45:58.254 --> 45:59.479
You're talking about Ben, still?

45:59.556 --> 46:01.186
Alison would
not do that.

46:01.263 --> 46:02.932
She would not
leave Joanie.

46:04.813 --> 46:06.589
Something stinks.

46:07.003 --> 46:08.430
I'll drop you guys
at the train station,

46:08.507 --> 46:09.946
but I'm gonna see this through.

46:10.023 --> 46:11.557
I'm gonna go see him.

46:16.936 --> 46:18.739
All right, let's go.

46:19.142 --> 46:20.181
To the train?

46:20.258 --> 46:21.940
No, with you.

46:22.579 --> 46:24.117
You don't have
to do that.

46:24.194 --> 46:25.314
Yeah, I do.

46:25.391 --> 46:26.586
I'm afraid
you're gonna kill him.

46:42.101 --> 46:43.828
Let's do this.

47:00.291 --> 47:01.979
I have to call you back.

47:07.042 --> 47:08.417
Hey.

47:09.186 --> 47:10.675
So you heard?

47:10.795 --> 47:11.947
Yeah.

47:13.703 --> 47:15.417
I'm so sorry.

47:18.531 --> 47:21.084
I want to talk about what
happened with you and Alison.

47:21.573 --> 47:23.214
What do you mean,
what happened?

47:24.202 --> 47:26.346
Well, you said
she broke up with you.

47:26.957 --> 47:27.884
Yeah.

47:27.962 --> 47:28.962
When?

47:31.813 --> 47:33.245
A couple days ago.

47:33.322 --> 47:34.997
How? Face-to-face?

47:35.517 --> 47:37.370
I don't have to tell you that.

47:38.881 --> 47:40.159
No, you don't.

47:40.678 --> 47:42.722
But if you don't, I'm gonna
think that you're hiding

47:42.799 --> 47:44.823
something, and I'm gonna
find out what it is.

47:48.124 --> 47:49.464
Who the fuck are you?

47:51.014 --> 47:52.345
I'm Noah.

47:52.578 --> 47:54.306
You're...

47:55.090 --> 47:57.008
Oh, Jesus Christ.

47:57.085 --> 47:58.243
Look, we're just looking

47:58.320 --> 47:59.920
for some answers, Ben.

48:00.347 --> 48:01.961
What happened doesn't
make sense to us.

48:02.038 --> 48:03.845
So did you see her?
Yes or no.

48:08.818 --> 48:11.690
Yes. We broke up in person.

48:12.188 --> 48:13.563
And what day was that?

48:13.640 --> 48:14.900
Thursday.

48:15.168 --> 48:16.646
I already told the police
all of this.

48:16.723 --> 48:18.489
Well, tell me, again.

48:18.696 --> 48:20.567
Where was it?
Did you go to her apartment?

48:20.644 --> 48:21.666
Yes.

48:22.269 --> 48:26.055
I went to her place,
she broke up with me, I left.

48:26.132 --> 48:27.987
And then what'd you do
after that?

48:29.611 --> 48:31.549
I went to an AA meeting.

48:31.626 --> 48:33.293
- What time?
- Ten o'clock.

48:33.370 --> 48:35.339
And what time
did you go over to see her?

48:35.527 --> 48:36.777
Seven.

48:37.424 --> 48:38.886
Three hours?

48:39.628 --> 48:41.198
It took you three hours
to break up?

48:41.275 --> 48:42.883
- What were you talking about?
- Look, none of your business.

48:42.960 --> 48:44.110
Get the fuck out of my office.

48:44.187 --> 48:46.902
I'm not leaving
until you answer my questions.

48:46.979 --> 48:48.190
He's hiding something.
Can't you see that?

48:48.267 --> 48:50.034
- I'm...
- He is hiding something!

48:53.628 --> 48:55.636
I apologized

48:56.479 --> 48:58.690
for not telling her
I was married.

49:00.636 --> 49:03.034
I told her I left
my wife for her,

49:04.394 --> 49:07.300
and I said I never met
a woman like her before.

49:09.853 --> 49:13.323
I didn't want to let her go.

49:15.340 --> 49:16.813
I said I'd stick around for her

49:16.890 --> 49:19.114
as long as it took
for her to trust me.

49:19.191 --> 49:20.714
And what did she say?

49:22.025 --> 49:24.495
She said she couldn't.

49:25.224 --> 49:28.534
She said she'd been hurt
one too many times.

49:28.939 --> 49:31.159
That's it? Doesn't sound
like that took three hours.

49:31.252 --> 49:32.409
It took 20 minutes.

49:32.486 --> 49:35.268
What happened between that
and the AA meeting?

49:39.647 --> 49:42.026
I got drunk, okay?

49:42.803 --> 49:44.956
I left her place, went out

49:45.033 --> 49:48.190
and got shit-faced for
the first time in almost a year.

49:48.710 --> 49:51.252
When the bartender
took my keys,

49:51.329 --> 49:53.576
I realized what I had done,
and what I had to do,

49:53.653 --> 49:56.492
so I took a cab
to the meeting in Riverhead,

49:56.569 --> 49:57.815
and turned in my medallions.

49:57.892 --> 50:00.033
Does that answer
your fucking questions?

50:01.665 --> 50:03.786
Call the bartender
if you don't believe me.

50:03.863 --> 50:06.057
- Cole, come on.
- What did you say to her?

50:06.164 --> 50:07.917
What? Listen, you need
to get him out of here...

50:07.994 --> 50:09.596
- What did you say to her?
- Come on.

50:09.673 --> 50:11.414
I don't know
what the fuck you're asking.

50:11.491 --> 50:12.899
I'm asking you what you said

50:12.976 --> 50:14.721
that made her want
to kill herself.

50:22.313 --> 50:25.268
You actually think there's
something I could have said?

50:27.215 --> 50:29.776
I knew Alison for six weeks.

50:29.853 --> 50:31.406
How long have you known her?

50:31.566 --> 50:33.964
- Come on, Cole, let's go.
- Or you, asshole?

50:34.066 --> 50:36.406
What did either of you
say to her, huh?

50:36.483 --> 50:38.633
Because she was fucked up
long before I ever met her.

50:38.710 --> 50:40.346
You think I could've
made an impact

50:40.423 --> 50:41.674
on the mess you both left?

50:41.751 --> 50:43.158
I tried!

50:44.923 --> 50:48.425
You want to know what happened
to Alison Bailey, Cole?

50:49.102 --> 50:51.555
Why don't you take a look
in the fucking mirror?!

50:51.632 --> 50:53.397
Come on, Cole, let's go.

50:53.474 --> 50:54.814
Come on.

51:06.209 --> 51:10.285
Cole. Cole.

51:10.362 --> 51:11.445
We...

51:11.772 --> 51:13.189
Fuck you!

51:13.568 --> 51:14.935
Guys!

51:16.798 --> 51:18.597
Come on. Stop it, guys.

51:18.674 --> 51:20.331
What the fuck are you doing?!

51:20.408 --> 51:21.486
Ow!

51:23.258 --> 51:24.549
Stop it!

51:25.951 --> 51:27.076
Stop!

51:27.465 --> 51:28.592
Guys, come on.

51:28.669 --> 51:30.761
Stop! Stop it!

51:30.838 --> 51:32.706
- Stop it!
- Why didn't you do something?!

51:33.791 --> 51:35.410
What?

51:35.719 --> 51:37.792
You had her in your hands.

51:38.642 --> 51:40.261
And you let her go.

51:44.257 --> 51:45.564
Why?

51:52.236 --> 51:53.830
Why?

52:05.154 --> 52:06.957
It's okay, Cole.

52:12.183 --> 52:13.674
It's okay.

52:16.457 --> 52:19.101
Why didn't you do more?

52:20.161 --> 52:22.805
Why didn't you do more?

52:58.105 --> 53:00.091
We gonna need to tape that up?

53:01.042 --> 53:02.817
No, it's okay.

53:15.830 --> 53:17.723
Think I'm-a just
get a burger.

53:17.959 --> 53:19.230
Yeah.

53:25.380 --> 53:27.161
You okay, Mr. Solloway?

53:29.738 --> 53:31.997
Anton, call me Noah.

53:33.472 --> 53:34.925
Okay.

53:41.863 --> 53:43.893
I'm-a go take a leak. Yeah.

53:43.970 --> 53:45.411
I'll be back.

54:30.465 --> 54:31.952
Hey, there.

54:34.928 --> 54:36.357
Hey.

54:36.857 --> 54:38.569
What can I get for you?

54:40.737 --> 54:43.069
Uh, I'll just have, uh,
two burgers,

54:43.146 --> 54:44.936
two fries, two Cokes, please.

54:45.407 --> 54:47.002
And for your friend?

54:47.459 --> 54:48.684
What?

54:49.831 --> 54:51.381
I'm kidding.

54:51.458 --> 54:52.749
Oh.

54:53.040 --> 54:55.093
From New Jersey,
or you just passing through?

54:55.170 --> 54:57.569
Uh, I'm just passing through.

55:00.478 --> 55:01.856
You look bad.

55:01.933 --> 55:03.302
Long day?

55:06.693 --> 55:08.725
Yeah, you could say that.

55:09.141 --> 55:11.539
Well, you've come
to the right place.

55:12.108 --> 55:13.911
I'll get your order
right in for you.
