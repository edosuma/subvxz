WEBVTT

00:02.417 --> 00:05.333
Whoa. What's with this construction?

00:05.417 --> 00:08.834
I don't know, but they dug
up this time capsule I buried.

00:08.917 --> 00:10.834
Ha! Look at this picture of us.

00:10.917 --> 00:12.542
We looked so ridiculous back then.

00:13.250 --> 00:15.500
When did you bury that thing? Last week.

00:16.709 --> 00:17.875
Well, be careful.

00:17.959 --> 00:20.500
I read that one hundred percent
of construction site accidents

00:20.583 --> 00:22.083
happen at construction sites.

00:23.709 --> 00:26.834
It was an obvious
but nonetheless important article.

00:26.917 --> 00:28.625
(phone beeps)

00:31.875 --> 00:33.375
Aaaah!

00:33.458 --> 00:34.375
(thud)

00:36.792 --> 00:38.792
Oliver! You okay?

00:38.875 --> 00:40.583
(coughing) Yeah. (groans)

00:40.667 --> 00:44.542
I'm fine. Luckily this rock broke my fall.

00:46.709 --> 00:48.417
And maybe my pelvis.

00:51.291 --> 00:53.333
(whooshing)

00:55.166 --> 00:56.500
You sure you're okay?

00:57.166 --> 00:59.417
Yeah, I just, uh...

00:59.500 --> 01:00.875
just a little dizzy.

01:01.458 --> 01:02.709
You look like you're in shock.

01:02.792 --> 01:05.500
I would be too if I had
aged as badly as you have.

01:06.625 --> 01:09.250
You've really let yourself go.

Uncle Horace.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.542
Check out his sound that I invented.

02:07.625 --> 02:11.625
(Tarzan-like yell)

02:12.875 --> 02:14.125
Not now, Alan.

02:14.834 --> 02:17.291
You know I'm marrying
Oliver's mother in a few weeks.

02:17.375 --> 02:21.083
Between choosing a location
and invitations and flowers,

02:21.166 --> 02:23.166
I have way too much on my plate.

02:24.333 --> 02:26.083
I don't even have room for my lunch.

02:27.458 --> 02:29.709
Well, maybe I could help with the wedding.

02:29.792 --> 02:32.792
-What's next on your list?
-I have to choose my best man.

02:32.875 --> 02:35.709
Ooh! Ooh! Pick me! I can be your best man!

02:37.000 --> 02:40.125
I'm sorry, Alan, but I don't think
you're cut out to be a best man.

02:40.208 --> 02:42.750
It takes being the best at something.

02:44.208 --> 02:46.583
I'll ask Dr. Fleever.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.917
He can't do it. He's hurt.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.458
What do you mean he's hurt?

02:50.542 --> 02:51.709
(whooshing)

02:56.375 --> 02:57.792
No, stop!

02:58.834 --> 03:01.208
Fine. I'll make you my best man.

03:01.291 --> 03:03.500
Great! I have so many ideas.

03:03.583 --> 03:05.250
If you like the sound that I invented,

03:05.333 --> 03:07.709
wait till you get a whiff
of the smell that I invented.

03:12.959 --> 03:15.083
Ambrose! My man!

03:15.166 --> 03:17.000
I'm not a man, I'm a mutant.

03:17.083 --> 03:18.917
Which is why I can see in my mind's eye

03:19.000 --> 03:21.458
all events in the superhero world
as they occur

03:21.542 --> 03:24.625
and draw comic books at lightning speed.

03:24.709 --> 03:27.375
It's also why I can chew gum like this.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.125
Tecton, my man.

03:39.792 --> 03:41.917
What's up? Ambrose is complaining

03:42.000 --> 03:44.917
that the Tecton comic books
have been boring lately.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.333
I can't help it if I always win so easily.

03:47.417 --> 03:49.417
That's not boring, that's consistent.

03:50.166 --> 03:52.834
Yes. Consistently boring.

03:54.583 --> 03:57.333
So sale are down, and who gets blamed? Me.

03:57.417 --> 03:58.792
I've been thrown out of my office

03:58.875 --> 04:01.792
and forced to use
Lizard Man's back as a desk.

04:05.917 --> 04:08.834
Kaz! You have to hear
this dream I had last night.

04:08.917 --> 04:10.417
It was a thousand years ago

04:10.500 --> 04:13.166
and I was onboard an alien spaceship

04:13.250 --> 04:15.417
that was carrying something
called the Arcturion,

04:15.500 --> 04:18.792
an object so powerful
that whoever gets their hands on it

04:18.875 --> 04:20.417
would become invincible.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.041
Wow! It is a cool dream.

04:23.125 --> 04:26.667
Ambrose, why don't you
just make that into a comic book?

04:26.750 --> 04:28.792
Does have all the necessary ingredients...

04:28.875 --> 04:31.667
except a hero, because it can't be Oliver.

04:31.750 --> 04:32.583
Look at him.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.417
Come on, man.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I'm not a man, I'm a mutant.

04:39.083 --> 04:40.625
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

04:41.166 --> 04:43.500
What if you make Tecton the hero

04:43.583 --> 04:46.667
and just use the story from Oliver's dream
in the next Tecton issue?

04:46.750 --> 04:48.417
Yeah, and I can give you more details.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.041
I wrote it all down in my dream
journal-slash-feelings journal-

04:51.125 --> 04:53.083
slash-Kaz-stop-reading-
my-journal journal.

04:54.125 --> 04:58.583
Perfect. Oliver,
I'll even give you a writing credit.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.709
That would be an honor.

05:00.792 --> 05:03.000
But my mom would kill me if she found out

05:03.083 --> 05:05.250
I was writing comic books
instead of studying.

05:05.333 --> 05:07.834
I know. There's a whole chapter
about it in your journal.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.583
But you could use a fake name.

05:12.667 --> 05:15.959
Like, uh... Quimby Fletcher.

05:16.709 --> 05:19.208
Quimby Fletcher. I like it.

05:19.291 --> 05:21.834
Okay, Quimby Fletcher it is.

05:23.542 --> 05:24.542
How'd you come up with that?

05:24.625 --> 05:28.709
Well, it's a combination
of my four favorite words:

05:28.792 --> 05:32.709
"Belch, quit, fry," and "me."

05:40.667 --> 05:41.709
Oh, Uncle Horace!

05:44.625 --> 05:47.875
As your best man, I've written
a song to sing at your wedding.

05:47.959 --> 05:49.583
This is what I have so far.

05:49.667 --> 05:53.583
(Tarzan-like yell)

05:54.583 --> 05:57.750
Very catchy. Like Galtraxian hemorrhoids.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.166
Why is this patient on the floor?

06:02.250 --> 06:05.000
Well, I needed room
for the place-setting options.

06:05.083 --> 06:06.417
He's not complaining.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.625
Because he's unconscious!

06:08.709 --> 06:12.417
Yeah. I knocked him unconscious
so he'd stop complaining.

06:13.750 --> 06:17.041
Anyway, good news. I hired Chef Mario,

06:17.125 --> 06:19.166
our cafeteria cook, to cater the wedding.

06:21.125 --> 06:23.083
Now, for an appetizer,

06:23.166 --> 06:25.250
I was thinking a delicious caprese salad.

06:32.875 --> 06:35.792
Alan, we're not serving
our guests vomited salad.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.000
Surely not one
with this much dressing on it.

06:42.041 --> 06:43.917
Got it. Dressing on the side.

06:46.208 --> 06:47.583
For the main course...

06:48.583 --> 06:51.125
grilled salmon with scalloped potatoes.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.208
These are mashed potatoes.

06:59.959 --> 07:02.542
I said I wanted scalloped!

07:04.250 --> 07:07.041
Hey! I didn't say I wouldn't eat it.

07:10.417 --> 07:14.667
Skylar, Alan is driving me crazy
with this best man stuff.

07:14.750 --> 07:18.250
Can you please talk to him for me?
Get him to calm down?

07:18.333 --> 07:21.000
Sure. I know how to handle him.

07:21.083 --> 07:23.125
Consider it your wedding present.

07:23.208 --> 07:25.333
Actually,
you're not invited to my wedding.

07:25.417 --> 07:27.291
But I will accept your gift anyway.

07:38.041 --> 07:41.291
Wow, I have never seen
so many people in here before.

07:41.375 --> 07:43.333
And it's all 'cause of me.

07:43.375 --> 07:46.875
Um, aren't you forgetting someone?

07:46.959 --> 07:51.333
Oh, yeah. That super-aggressive mime
that people ran into here to avoid.

07:55.125 --> 07:57.917
Guys, have you read the new Tecton issue?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.667
It reminds me exactly
of a dream I had the other night.

08:01.291 --> 08:02.417
Really? What dream?

08:02.500 --> 08:05.667
I had this crazy dream
where I didn't have bangs,

08:05.750 --> 08:09.792
but I was slow dancing
with a llama that did have bangs.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.375
How is that anything like this?

08:14.041 --> 08:18.417
It's obvious. Neither of our dreams
are about llamas.

08:18.500 --> 08:21.166
Except mine. Need I go on?

08:23.750 --> 08:25.375
Don't go on, just go.

08:29.083 --> 08:32.458
This is incredible.
Everyone is crazy for my comic book.

08:32.542 --> 08:35.000
Okay, no,
they're not crazy for your comic,

08:35.083 --> 08:38.041
they're crazy for Quimby Fletcher's,
a name that I created.

08:38.125 --> 08:40.959
And it was my idea to make
your dream into a comic book

08:41.041 --> 08:42.583
and to make Tecton the hero.

08:42.667 --> 08:45.417
So I'm as much Quimby Fletcher as you are.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.166
And you'd know that if you
would have bothered to read the entry

08:48.250 --> 08:50.375
that I wrote for you
in your feelings journal.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.834
Boss, we're on our way
to torture this Quimby Fletcher.

09:00.166 --> 09:02.083
It's me, Mort. Your new enforcer?

09:03.709 --> 09:05.709
No, no, I took over for Steve.

09:05.792 --> 09:08.291
You executed Steve
for eating the last apple in the fridge.

09:13.208 --> 09:14.625
Excuse me.

09:14.709 --> 09:17.291
My associate and I are...

09:17.375 --> 09:19.375
movie producers from Hollywood.

09:20.458 --> 09:23.291
Wow! Movie producers?

09:23.375 --> 09:26.709
Anyway, we're fascinated
by this Arcturion story.

09:26.792 --> 09:28.250
We'd like to make a movie out of it.

09:29.041 --> 09:30.959
Do you know where we
can find Quimby Fletcher?

09:31.041 --> 09:32.834
All right, well, I'm headed back to work

09:32.917 --> 09:36.834
where I will help save lives
and you will try to take credit for it.

09:36.917 --> 09:38.625
Right, Quimby Fletcher?

09:40.500 --> 09:42.291
You're Quimby Fletcher?

09:43.375 --> 09:45.625
That is what you heard, isn't it?

09:47.750 --> 09:51.500
Mr. Fletcher. We need to go discuss
this Arcturion story right away.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.750
Well, ya know...

09:54.834 --> 09:57.333
I've had a lot of interest
from other producers,

09:57.417 --> 10:00.166
so you're gonna have
to make me a great offer.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.917
What if we offer not to saw you in half?

10:09.625 --> 10:11.667
You guys are making a huge mistake.

10:11.750 --> 10:15.250
And I'm not talking about the fact
that you rented way too much office space

10:15.333 --> 10:16.500
for just two people.

10:17.583 --> 10:20.458
You're the one who made a mistake
by writing that comic book

10:20.542 --> 10:22.375
and telling world about the Arcturion.

10:22.458 --> 10:24.917
My boss won't stop
until he gets his hands on it

10:25.000 --> 10:27.667
and becomes
the most powerful man on Earth.

10:27.750 --> 10:30.667
Wait. Th-The Arcturion is real

10:30.750 --> 10:33.083
and you're henchmen for some villain?

10:33.166 --> 10:34.834
Huh. I wish.

10:34.917 --> 10:36.709
Right now we're just lackeys

10:36.792 --> 10:38.542
hoping to get promoted to goons.

10:39.917 --> 10:41.667
But if we bring our boss the Arcturion,

10:41.750 --> 10:43.458
we skip goon and go straight to henchman.

10:45.041 --> 10:48.291
Well, if you let me go, I would be
happy to write you a recommendation.

10:49.375 --> 10:53.333
Quiet! We ain't foolin' around, kid.

10:53.417 --> 10:54.875
Are we, Richie?

11:00.125 --> 11:01.375
(hissing)

11:05.208 --> 11:08.458
Now tell us where the Arcturion is,
kid, or things are gonna get weird.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.500
That wasn't the weird part?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.583
Please! I didn't even know
that the Arcturion was real.

11:15.667 --> 11:19.417
And I can't tell you anything because
the whole comic book was based on a dream!

11:20.500 --> 11:21.750
Dream, huh?

11:24.709 --> 11:26.041
That confirms it.

11:26.125 --> 11:29.208
The boss said the Arcturion spaceship
had a device on it

11:29.291 --> 11:31.625
that transmitted all the information
about the Arcturion

11:31.709 --> 11:33.375
into the dreams of whoever touched it.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.667
Now we're gonna hook
you up to our dream imager

11:37.750 --> 11:41.166
and get all the information we need
directly from your brain.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.625
And then we're gonna eliminate you!

11:45.041 --> 11:48.000
Wait, I-I'm not even Quimby Fletcher!

11:48.083 --> 11:50.208
And I don't have
any information in my brain,

11:50.291 --> 11:52.041
any of my teachers can tell you that!

11:53.583 --> 11:55.417
Well, we'll see soon enough.

11:55.500 --> 11:59.291
And if you see that I don't know
anything, you'll let me go?

11:59.375 --> 12:01.959
No. We just told you our whole plan.

12:02.041 --> 12:03.250
We still gotta eliminate you.

12:10.208 --> 12:14.458
(old-fashioned swing music plays)

12:14.542 --> 12:16.500
What kind of wedding DJ are you?

12:16.583 --> 12:18.250
Don't you have any more current music?

12:19.250 --> 12:21.041
(DJ-style scratching)

12:21.125 --> 12:22.166
("needle" scratches)

12:25.041 --> 12:30.375
Alan, it seems you're taking
this whole best man thing way seriously.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.166
Maybe you should ease up a bit.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.583
Oh, I see what you're getting at.

12:34.667 --> 12:36.583
You're trying to trick me
into doing a bad job

12:36.667 --> 12:38.875
so my Uncle Horace
will make you his best man!

12:39.458 --> 12:42.750
What? That's ridiculous.
I'm not even a man.

12:42.834 --> 12:44.458
Well, you dress like one.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.834
And your plan failed.

12:48.917 --> 12:50.375
Not only am I not going to ease up,

12:50.458 --> 12:52.125
I'm going to work even harder!

12:52.208 --> 12:53.583
Hey, wait.

12:54.792 --> 12:57.083
How do I put this gently...

12:57.166 --> 12:58.709
You should sit down.

13:00.583 --> 13:03.667
Good. Now stay there
and don't move until after the wedding,

13:03.750 --> 13:05.500
because Horace
says you're ruining his life.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.875
What? I can't believe it.

13:08.959 --> 13:11.500
I was just trying
to make his wedding special.

13:11.583 --> 13:15.583
I know. I'm really sorry.
I hope you understand.

13:16.417 --> 13:17.875
Well, I understand.

13:19.041 --> 13:21.125
My Uncle Horace has never appreciated me!

13:21.208 --> 13:23.125
He thinks I'm making
his life difficult now?

13:23.208 --> 13:24.709
I'm going to go down
to Bridget's office,

13:24.792 --> 13:27.208
I'm going to tell her everything
about Horace and Mighty Med.

13:27.291 --> 13:28.125
Everything!

13:29.291 --> 13:31.458
Alan, wait! Stop!

13:32.875 --> 13:36.667
(horror music)

13:36.750 --> 13:37.750
(music stops)

13:43.458 --> 13:46.750
(sighs)
Still nothin' about the Arcturion.

13:47.709 --> 13:50.417
Oh, wait. Another dream is comin' on.

13:53.959 --> 13:57.375
Hi, Kaz! Oh, hi, Sunflower Kaz!

13:58.166 --> 13:59.834
Watch out for that pile of--

13:59.917 --> 14:01.625
-(squish)
-(groans)

14:01.709 --> 14:04.625
Oh. Hi, Dog Mess Kaz!

14:08.959 --> 14:10.834
What is wrong with this kid?

14:15.458 --> 14:18.792
Ah, Tecton.
The Arcturion comic is a big hit.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.583
In fact, it's selling so well

14:20.667 --> 14:23.000
Horace got me a fancy new desk.

14:26.709 --> 14:29.417
I cannot believe it.
My friend Gus just told me

14:29.500 --> 14:31.458
that Kaz took credit for my comic book,

14:31.542 --> 14:33.959
he's trying to sell the film rights
to some movie producers.

14:34.041 --> 14:37.250
I hope it's not the guys
that made Tecton Lives.

14:37.333 --> 14:39.792
They cast Jonah Hill as me.

14:39.875 --> 14:41.208
Jonah Hill!

14:44.000 --> 14:45.750
Ambrose, can you do me a favor

14:45.834 --> 14:48.208
and use your powers to draw
where Kaz is so I can stop him?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.458
Wait. Those aren't Hollywood producers.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.875
It looks like Kaz was tricked
by some kind of henchmen.

15:00.959 --> 15:03.417
Actually,
they look more like lackeys to me,

15:03.500 --> 15:06.208
but you're right, Kaz is in danger.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.250
Ambrose, can you tell us
where this location is?

15:09.333 --> 15:11.125
Hold on. Through that window.

15:11.208 --> 15:13.125
That's the National City Bank building.

15:13.208 --> 15:15.709
I got in a huge fight
near there last week.

15:15.792 --> 15:17.417
With my ex-girlfriend.

15:17.500 --> 15:21.417
She's always like, "You have
super-hearing, but you never listen."

15:23.500 --> 15:25.166
Okay, well, hurry. We have to rescue Kaz.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.291
Ambrose, are you coming?

15:26.375 --> 15:28.125
No, I need to straighten up my desk.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.375
That's not what I meant!

15:40.250 --> 15:41.125
Skylar!

15:42.959 --> 15:45.709
Did you give me the wedding gift
we talked about?

15:45.792 --> 15:48.041
Yeah, about that...

15:48.750 --> 15:52.709
The good news is,
I talked to Alan and he took it very well.

15:52.792 --> 15:55.542
The bad news is,
I just blatantly lied to you.

15:57.417 --> 15:58.458
What happened?

15:58.542 --> 16:00.542
How do I put this gently?

16:01.375 --> 16:03.250
Alan went to your fiancée's office

16:03.333 --> 16:06.625
to tell her all the secrets you've been
keeping about yourself and Mighty Med.

16:06.709 --> 16:08.166
So the wedding's probably off.

16:09.583 --> 16:14.250
Oh, no. I've gotta call Bridget,
come totally clean,

16:14.333 --> 16:15.834
and beg her to forgive me!

16:17.250 --> 16:20.458
And by the way, this is why
no one invites you to anything.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.250
Alan! Did you talk to Bridget?

16:27.875 --> 16:31.166
No. I thought about what you said,
and you were right.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.250
I was overdoing it.

16:33.333 --> 16:35.291
Besides, I don't feel too good.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.917
I've eaten a lot of vomit samples today.

16:39.959 --> 16:42.250
Oh, no. I gotta warn Horace!

16:43.917 --> 16:47.000
Bridget, everything Alan told you is true.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.083
He's my nephew, not my son.

16:50.875 --> 16:54.208
I'm not forty-seven,
I'm three thousand and forty-seven.

16:54.291 --> 16:57.959
And I'm a superhero doctor
who can bring people back to life,

16:58.041 --> 16:59.875
not a founding member
of the Blue Man group.

17:01.875 --> 17:04.166
Anyway, call me when you get his message.

17:05.375 --> 17:07.834
Horace, Alan didn't tell her anything.

17:07.917 --> 17:11.208
Then why didn't you try to get
my attention and stop me?

17:11.959 --> 17:13.917
What do you think this means?

17:16.083 --> 17:18.625
I thought you were just imitating
that aggressive mime

17:18.709 --> 17:21.333
that hangs out near that comic book store.

17:21.417 --> 17:24.000
Now what? Bridget knows everything.

17:24.875 --> 17:25.750
Mr. Quick!

17:25.834 --> 17:28.959
Instead of getting me monogrammed
hand towels for my wedding,

17:29.792 --> 17:32.750
could you maybe go mug
my fiancée and steal her phone?

17:36.959 --> 17:38.291
Gently mug!

17:39.500 --> 17:40.625
(whooshing)

17:43.458 --> 17:44.500
(phone beeps)

17:44.583 --> 17:47.250
There. Problem solved.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.250
Uncle Horace, sorry if I went a little
overboard with the best man thing.

17:52.333 --> 17:54.125
I just wanted you to be happy.

17:54.208 --> 17:56.041
No, Alan, I'm sorry.

17:56.125 --> 17:59.375
I should have been more appreciative
of all the work you were doing.

17:59.458 --> 18:01.125
Even though all of it was terrible.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.583
(sniffles) That's all I wanted to hear.

18:11.083 --> 18:13.375
Now he's dreamin' he's a human lighthouse.

18:16.792 --> 18:17.959
Richie, unhook him.

18:18.041 --> 18:20.834
I want him to be wide awake
when we tear his legs off.

19:24.291 --> 19:25.709
You okay?

19:26.625 --> 19:29.709
Ohh! Man, why did you wake me up?

19:30.458 --> 19:34.000
I had the face of an eagle,
I was riding on an eagle,

19:34.083 --> 19:37.333
and I was the quarterback
for the Philadelphia Eagles.

19:38.291 --> 19:41.542
I guess that's the same
as "Thank you for saving my life."

19:41.625 --> 19:43.625
Oh. Right, sorry.

19:43.709 --> 19:45.250
Thanks, buddy.

19:45.333 --> 19:46.792
I'm just glad you're all right.

19:46.875 --> 19:51.000
Yeah. I'm a little out of it,
but I'm sure having my brain probed

19:51.083 --> 19:55.166
well have no long-lasting side...
(gibberish)

19:57.208 --> 19:59.542
(laughs) Just messin' with ya, man.

19:59.625 --> 20:02.583
I am completely... (gibberish)

20:03.709 --> 20:04.792
Uh-oh.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.709
I can't believe
the Arcturion actually exists.

20:11.792 --> 20:13.792
I thought I'd finally
had a creative dream.

20:13.875 --> 20:15.750
Usually they're just us
sitting here like this.

20:17.583 --> 20:20.291
Although sometimes you're a sunflower.

20:21.917 --> 20:25.667
That's why I had that dream!
I read it in your journal.

20:28.750 --> 20:31.458
So we need to find
the Arcturion before they find it.

20:32.500 --> 20:35.792
-Or find us.
-They're not gonna find us.

20:35.875 --> 20:37.834
I'm sure Tecton caught them.

20:37.917 --> 20:41.792
Besides, their boss doesn't even know
who the real Quimby Fletcher is.

20:41.875 --> 20:44.083
So there's nothing to be scared of.

20:45.667 --> 20:47.875
You're scared, aren't you?

20:47.959 --> 20:49.500
Well, you should be!

20:49.583 --> 20:52.917
But Mr. Terror, sir, we're sorry.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.333
We barely got away from Tecton,

20:54.417 --> 20:56.875
and this Quimby Fletcher's really hard
to track down.

20:56.959 --> 20:59.166
I want the Arcturion found!

20:59.250 --> 21:03.375
And bring me Quimby Fletcher,
he knows too much.

21:03.458 --> 21:05.417
Not as much as you. (nervous laughter)

21:05.500 --> 21:08.583
You're a genius. A-And handsome. I assume.

21:10.208 --> 21:12.583
Well, no one's ever seen you,
but you sound handsome.

21:12.667 --> 21:14.417
-(goofy laughter)
-Quiet!

21:15.875 --> 21:18.458
I'll give you one more chance.

21:18.542 --> 21:20.500
But if you fail...

21:24.500 --> 21:28.792
Yeah, this is what I get for sending
lackeys to do a henchmen's job!

21:33.041 --> 21:35.625
(theme music plays)

21:57.000 --> 21:58.250
(boing)

22:02.083 --> 22:03.041
(boy) Yes!
