Hey.

Now what?

00:14.798 --> 00:16.464
How about this?

00:19.464 --> 00:20.798
You're suspending me?

00:20.864 --> 00:24.564
No, let's just call it
an extended...vacation.

00:25.798 --> 00:28.831
You sure you don't
wanna give me a raise?

00:31.031 --> 00:32.098
Damn.

00:32.164 --> 00:35.531
Man, I had the day from hell.

00:36.831 --> 00:40.531
Come on, Khadijah,
let's do this.

00:40.598 --> 00:41.764
Max..

00:41.831 --> 00:43.964
This is not exactly
the best timing.

Ooh! Yeah, that's it.

01:26.704 --> 01:29.238
Oh, you got to shake harder.

01:29.304 --> 01:31.238
You got to shake it harder.

‐ If I hear one word of this..
‐ Mm‐hmm.

02:10.711 --> 02:12.178
...I will kill you

02:12.244 --> 02:13.411
burn you

02:13.478 --> 02:16.211
and salt the earth
where I bury you.

02:16.278 --> 02:17.811
So, that <i>nothing..</i>

02:17.877 --> 02:19.044

02:28.578 --> 02:30.311
‐ Give me that!
‐ W‐wait, wait, wait!

02:41.511 --> 02:42.878
Well..

02:42.944 --> 02:44.411
I can see you takin' advantage

02:44.478 --> 02:47.078
of havin' the place
all to yourself.

02:47.144 --> 02:48.311
[chuckles]
Yeah.

02:49.078 --> 02:50.311
What was that?

02:50.378 --> 02:53.911
Umm, that is a rat
I just chased into the kitchen.

02:53.978 --> 02:56.344

a little look, shall we?

it is between us.

how much you know.

natural with him.

nothing natural about it.

pump under the chair.

I fixed the heel.

10:57.731 --> 11:01.171
And to think, I actually
drank out of this.

11:05.071 --> 11:09.571
Look here, man, it's time
for some tough love.

11:09.638 --> 11:12.738
Man, there's obviously
somethin' between you and Max.

11:12.804 --> 11:15.204
‐ Oh, but, you‐‐
‐ Look, stop.

11:15.271 --> 11:18.004
Now, what you all need to do
is just figure out

11:18.071 --> 11:20.971
if it's love or hate.

11:24.871 --> 11:26.671
Oh, Max.

11:26.738 --> 11:28.738
Max, if you really hated Kyle

11:28.804 --> 11:30.504
you couldn't have
slept with him.

11:30.571 --> 11:33.871
No, no.
Max is versatile that way.

11:35.571 --> 11:38.738
Oh, I can't believe it.

11:38.804 --> 11:41.504
I got suspended from work.

11:41.571 --> 11:44.138
I slept with a toad.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.004
And, now, I have to
live with the memory.

11:48.071 --> 11:50.404
Why <i>me?</i>

11:50.471 --> 11:52.704
Well, girl, that's what happens
when you don't put money

11:52.771 --> 11:56.704
in the collection plate
three weeks in a row.

11:56.771 --> 11:58.371
Mm‐hmm.

12:00.978 --> 12:03.678
Maxine Shaw, I would like
to have a word with you

12:03.744 --> 12:05.478
in private, please.

12:05.544 --> 12:07.044
Anything you have to say to me

12:07.111 --> 12:08.778
you can say
in front of my girls.

12:08.844 --> 12:10.478
Fine! Will you have
dinner with me tonight?

12:10.544 --> 12:13.578
‐ Yes!
‐ Pick you up at 7:00.

12:19.378 --> 12:21.744
[instrumental music]

12:25.478 --> 12:26.978
[instrumental music]

12:28.621 --> 12:31.187
Isn't anyone else
the least bit concerned

12:31.254 --> 12:33.754
that Max and Kyle
are on a date?

12:33.821 --> 12:36.821
The repercussions of their union
will be very cataclysmic.

12:36.887 --> 12:38.954
The lion and the lamb
will live as one.

12:39.021 --> 12:40.921
The law of gravity
will be repelled!

12:40.987 --> 12:43.287
It's gonna be bad all around!

12:44.421 --> 12:47.554
Girl, you here to play,
or you here to talk?

12:55.487 --> 12:56.787
Oh, my.

12:58.287 --> 13:01.027
Well, Kyle and Max seem
like a good couple to me.

13:01.094 --> 13:03.594
Everybody seems like
a good couple to you.

13:03.661 --> 13:05.527
I believe in love.

13:05.594 --> 13:09.894
And you just keep on
keepin' on, sweet pea.

13:09.961 --> 13:12.161
‐ Hey, baby.
‐ Hey, baby, what's up?

13:12.227 --> 13:13.794
Did you get the job?

13:13.861 --> 13:15.627
Uh, well, it's like this.

13:15.694 --> 13:17.827
You're looking at the new
director of artist relations

13:17.894 --> 13:19.827
for Halogen Records!

13:19.894 --> 13:22.394
[all cheering]

13:22.461 --> 13:25.194
Oh, joys!

13:25.261 --> 13:27.261
Now, if Max and Kyle
get together

13:27.327 --> 13:31.327
everybody's gonna
have a man, but me.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.527
Max and Kyle are gettin'
together? Hey, good for them.

13:33.594 --> 13:34.927
Oh, what do you know?

13:34.994 --> 13:38.294
You haven't been
around but a minute.

13:38.361 --> 13:39.794
Regine, relax!

13:39.861 --> 13:41.827
Max and Kyle are
not gettin' together.

13:41.894 --> 13:43.694
They have spent too many
years dissing each other.

13:43.761 --> 13:45.194
They don't know
anything else.

13:45.261 --> 13:48.394
They know how to wear out
a good recliner.

13:52.994 --> 13:54.927
[instrumental music]

13:55.994 --> 13:57.327
Oh.

13:57.394 --> 14:01.634
Maxine, we did not come here
not to talk to each other.

14:01.701 --> 14:04.067
Fine. Talk away.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.734
Well, we've never
really gotten along.

14:07.801 --> 14:09.134
Right from the start,
remember you were bringing

14:09.201 --> 14:10.234
that box into the house?

14:10.301 --> 14:11.934
Mm‐hmm. You asked me
if I need a help.

14:12.001 --> 14:14.267
And you said, "Drop that.
I can carry my own box.

14:14.334 --> 14:16.834
‐ Scrawny bucket head grime.
‐ Scrawny bucket head grime.

14:16.901 --> 14:18.101
[both chuckling]

14:18.167 --> 14:20.101
‐ You remembered?
‐ 'Ha ha.'

14:22.167 --> 14:25.401
My memory is one of
my greatest assets.

14:25.467 --> 14:28.401
I believe you've become
acquainted with the other.

14:32.201 --> 14:34.167
Look here, Kyle.

14:34.234 --> 14:38.201
I was traumatized after
being suspended from work.

14:38.267 --> 14:40.801
I was desperate
and out of my mind.

14:40.867 --> 14:42.434
What's your excuse?

14:42.501 --> 14:45.267
You're beautiful
when I'm drunk.

14:45.334 --> 14:49.301
And, besides, I mean, at least,
you can say you slept with me.

14:49.367 --> 14:50.967
[scoffs]
You still have your dignity.

14:51.034 --> 14:52.834
What do I have?

14:52.901 --> 14:55.767
No chance in hell
of getting seconds.

14:57.667 --> 15:00.474
Thirds, Max.
Thirds.

15:08.207 --> 15:11.207
You make me <i>sick!</i>

15:11.274 --> 15:14.374
‐ You make me puke.
‐ You are puke.

15:14.441 --> 15:17.074
‐ Dance?
‐ Love to.

15:19.374 --> 15:21.041
[instrumental music]

15:43.774 --> 15:45.074
Alright.
So, what do you think?

15:45.141 --> 15:47.807
‐ Maxine Barker?
‐ Oh.

15:47.874 --> 15:51.307
Maxine Shaw‐Barker?

15:51.374 --> 15:54.374
Uh‐uh, Maxine Barker‐Shaw?

15:55.474 --> 15:57.341
I mean, for real,
if they hook up

15:57.407 --> 15:59.141
his name is
gonna be Kyle Shaw.

15:59.207 --> 16:00.347
[chuckles]

16:01.547 --> 16:03.347
I don't care what
they call themselves.

16:03.414 --> 16:05.614
This cannot happen!

16:05.681 --> 16:08.214
Oh, Regine,
I think you'd be happy.

16:08.281 --> 16:11.347
If they start dating, maybe
she won't be down here so much.

16:11.414 --> 16:13.481
Oh, please!
Who're you foolin', huh?

16:13.547 --> 16:16.147
In no time this place
will be crawlin'

16:16.214 --> 16:18.447
with freeloadin'
dreadlock havin'

16:18.514 --> 16:21.547
crumb‐snatchin'
little Barker‐Shaws!

16:23.747 --> 16:27.214
Well, if they have five of 'em,
they can form a singin' group.

16:28.481 --> 16:31.247
Okay, do you think
Max and Kyle would change?

16:31.314 --> 16:33.381
[scoffing]
Duh! Of course, they will.

16:33.447 --> 16:36.114
Everybody does.
Look at her.

16:37.514 --> 16:39.281
I haven't changed.

16:39.347 --> 16:41.514
‐ Have I, skooie‐pooie?
‐ Mmm.

16:43.014 --> 16:44.981
It's all good, baby.

16:46.247 --> 16:48.181
Oh, get a room.

16:48.847 --> 16:50.414
Excuse you.

16:50.481 --> 16:53.014
Can we get back to
the tragedy at hand, huh?

16:53.081 --> 16:54.081
Okay.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.914
Now, has anyone considered

16:55.981 --> 16:59.281
what will happen to me,
if Max and Kyle get together?

16:59.347 --> 17:00.654
I'm sorry.

17:00.721 --> 17:03.821
We must have gotten all
our priorities all messed up.

17:03.887 --> 17:06.487
What will happen to you?

17:06.554 --> 17:09.954
All of Max's bitterness
will have to find a new target.

17:10.021 --> 17:13.854
She's afraid of you.
Synclaire will cry.

17:13.921 --> 17:15.186
So, that leaves <i>moi.</i>

17:15.253 --> 17:17.421
And I'm not havin' it.

17:19.387 --> 17:23.253
You know, Regine, while you were
talkin' I had a minute to think.

17:24.186 --> 17:26.221
You need to shut up.

17:32.054 --> 17:35.821
Okay, fine. It's alright.
I don't need none of ya'll.

17:37.021 --> 17:40.154
I will be the lone voice
of sanity in this room.

17:40.221 --> 17:43.587
But if they come back in here
talkin' that weird couple mess

17:43.654 --> 17:45.787
I will drive
a wedge between them.

17:45.854 --> 17:47.121
You give me three days

17:47.187 --> 17:50.421
a camera...and
an airbrush kit.

17:50.487 --> 17:52.121
Anyone can do what you can.

17:52.187 --> 17:53.987
But you remember what
happened last time.

17:54.054 --> 17:56.387
You wanna go to court again?

17:56.454 --> 17:59.421
Alright, calm down.
This is ridiculous.

17:59.487 --> 18:01.794
We're talkin' about
a couple's destiny.

18:01.861 --> 18:05.327
We can't just
trivialize it like this.

18:05.394 --> 18:07.794
‐ Let's put some money on it.
‐ Okay.

18:07.861 --> 18:10.561
[all talking indistinctly]

18:10.627 --> 18:13.327
[instrumental music]

18:13.394 --> 18:15.761
This is your problem, Maxine.

18:15.827 --> 18:18.261
You don't know
how to let a man lead.

18:19.527 --> 18:21.461
I've seen where
you can take me.

18:21.527 --> 18:24.461
I don't wanna go there.

18:25.694 --> 18:27.061
Afraid?

18:27.661 --> 18:28.627
Bored.

18:34.127 --> 18:38.061
Maxine, why're you so
threatened by my manhood, huh?

18:38.127 --> 18:40.627
Don't you have
enough of your own?

18:42.327 --> 18:44.661
[all applauding]

18:54.261 --> 18:55.227
Mm.

18:55.294 --> 18:57.027
You know, you held
your own out there.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.794
Well, you managed to catch me
off guard a couple of times.

18:59.861 --> 19:01.734
Oh, Max, you've always
got your guard up.

19:01.801 --> 19:04.234
Hey, when you let it go,
you can get hurt.

19:04.301 --> 19:05.934
Not all the time.

19:06.001 --> 19:07.934
What about last night?

19:10.434 --> 19:12.067
What about it?

19:12.134 --> 19:13.234
[chuckles]

19:13.301 --> 19:14.934
Come on, Max, admit it.

19:15.001 --> 19:16.334
It was good.

19:18.567 --> 19:20.734
Mm, it didn't stink.

19:21.701 --> 19:24.134
Alright, who had the soup?

19:24.201 --> 19:26.567
Oh, thank you.

19:26.634 --> 19:29.734
So, Maxine..

19:29.801 --> 19:31.834
What's it going to be?

19:34.267 --> 19:37.634
Kyle, we've known
each other for a long time.

19:37.701 --> 19:39.667
Sniping..

19:39.734 --> 19:41.834
...fighting..

19:41.901 --> 19:45.367
...cutting each other down.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.634
I don't wanna lose all that.

19:52.034 --> 19:53.934
Neither do I.

19:55.934 --> 19:57.701
[instrumental music]

19:57.767 --> 20:00.107
Ooh, salsa!

20:01.074 --> 20:03.374
Please, you can't do salsa.

20:03.441 --> 20:05.774
[speaking Spanish]

20:06.641 --> 20:08.374
Aah, yeah.

20:28.041 --> 20:29.307
[sighs]

20:33.241 --> 20:35.041
Well..

20:35.934 --> 20:37.668
‐ Ah, you're home!
‐ How'd it go?

20:37.734 --> 20:38.801
Anything interesting go down?

20:38.868 --> 20:39.968
That you care to share?

20:40.034 --> 20:41.768
Alright, look,
let's get to the point.

20:41.834 --> 20:43.834
You'll are not
a couple, are you?

20:43.901 --> 20:46.468
Please, I'm not drunk tonight.

20:46.534 --> 20:50.101
[scoffs]
And your face killed my buzz.

20:50.168 --> 20:51.468
Scarecrow.

20:51.534 --> 20:53.234
Mop head.

20:54.934 --> 20:56.334
Well, there's nothin' to see.

20:56.401 --> 20:58.334
Come on, everybody, back to
your homes. Let's go, let's go.

20:58.401 --> 21:01.541
Pay up, I win, I win. Give me
my money, give me my money.

21:01.608 --> 21:04.374
Thanks! Come on, get,
get, get to steppin'.

21:04.441 --> 21:07.208
That's what you get
for slidin' a skootie‐pootie.

21:20.974 --> 21:22.341
Goodnight, Kyle.

21:24.774 --> 21:26.074
Goodnight, Max.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.541
[instrumental music]

21:41.108 --> 21:42.608
[salsa music]

22:24.581 --> 22:25.581
<i>Whoo‐hoo!</i>
