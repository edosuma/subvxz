01:39.280 --> 01:40.880
<i>Last night?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

01:40.960 --> 01:43.440
<i>Last time was four years ago,</i>
<i>is that right?</i>

01:43.520 --> 01:45.200
When my daughter, Emma,

01:45.280 --> 01:47.960
she went missing at the shopping centre.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.560
Three incidents of fugue prior to that.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.160
The first, of course,
was with little Juliet.

01:56.360 --> 01:57.480
Yeah.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.720
Last time...

02:01.800 --> 02:03.040
you were quite violent.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.440
Do you have a feeling that
that might have happened again?

02:08.520 --> 02:10.800
I, erm...

02:10.880 --> 02:12.880
I don't know. Maybe.

02:15.480 --> 02:19.160
I can arrange a CAT scan,
but we found nothing wrong the last time.

02:22.760 --> 02:26.880
We think these episodes
are triggered by extreme stress.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.720
My husband left me.

02:38.640 --> 02:40.600
That's...
That's...

02:43.520 --> 02:46.560
-That's been affecting me.
-Mmm-hmm.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.640
Sorry.

02:49.640 --> 02:52.920
How long would you say you were
in that state on this occasion?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.920
Erm... the first time was an hour,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.400
and the second time
was a bit longer.

02:58.480 --> 02:59.920
I was driving.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.520
It's happened twice?

03:02.520 --> 03:04.840
Yeah, the first one was...

03:04.920 --> 03:06.720
closer to the breakup.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.040
Hmm.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.120
-Doubtful.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.560
Perhaps some fragments.

03:16.440 --> 03:19.960
You didn't get any memories back
from the previous incidents, did you?

03:20.680 --> 03:22.000
-Mmm.
-No.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.040
Obviously, if you were
to talk to someone--

03:24.120 --> 03:26.960
No. No, no.
No one can know.

03:29.640 --> 03:30.760
No one must know.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.400
<i>DTG Construction.</i>

04:12.480 --> 04:14.480
Hi, I'd like to speak to, erm,

04:14.560 --> 04:15.800
Grace Gibson, please.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.920
<i>One moment, please.</i>

04:18.000 --> 04:20.160
<i>Grace Gibson's office.</i>
<i>How may I help you?</i>

04:20.240 --> 04:23.080
Hi, can I speak to Grace Gibson?

04:23.160 --> 04:26.480
<i>I'm sorry, she's in a meeting.</i>
<i>Who could I say called?</i>

04:26.560 --> 04:28.000
Erm...

04:28.080 --> 04:30.000
It's okay, I'll call back.

04:30.080 --> 04:31.120
Thanks.

04:39.040 --> 04:42.200
<i>Hi, this is Grace Gibson.</i>
<i>I'm unavailable right now.</i>

04:42.280 --> 04:44.160
<i>Please leave a message,</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

04:44.240 --> 04:47.160
Grace, you're late.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.800
Hope you're on your way.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.560
Still no answer.

04:50.640 --> 04:51.800
Postpone the meeting.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.120
It's pointless without Grace.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.880
Go over to her house.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.360
Why? She's just late.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.240
Okay.

05:03.560 --> 05:06.440
I'm gonna grab some air,
and I'll try her again.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.720
Do you wanna come along?

05:20.800 --> 05:22.600
-Mmm.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.000
Now, why would I do that?

05:24.080 --> 05:26.480
I'm assuming you've got the keys,
if nothing else.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.080
Yeah, I know.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.320
It's okay.

06:08.720 --> 06:09.760
Grace

06:25.120 --> 06:26.680
Grace, are you here?

06:37.640 --> 06:39.000
Is she here?

06:39.080 --> 06:40.120
No.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.160
Grace?

07:47.760 --> 07:50.320
<i>Hey.</i>
<i>I'm just heading home.</i>

07:50.400 --> 07:52.560
I'm just about to check out, actually.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.760
Er... one or two hours.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.440
All right. Love you.

08:02.480 --> 08:03.600
Shit!

08:16.720 --> 08:19.960
Marcella Backland.
Sorry I'm late.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.440
You're meeting up
with Peter Cullen, aren't you?

08:23.520 --> 08:24.840
Why are you interested in Peter?

08:25.760 --> 08:28.240
His name's come up
as part of an investigation.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.240
What investigation?

08:32.440 --> 08:33.520
I can help you.

08:34.520 --> 08:35.520
He trusts me.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.360
Well, I hope you don't trust him.

08:37.440 --> 08:39.440
Why are you meeting Peter?

08:39.520 --> 08:43.320
I'm studying a master's degree
in Investigative Forensic Psychology,

08:43.400 --> 08:46.160
and I'm writing an essay on
domestic violence that results in death.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.440
So you know
he's a very dangerous man.

08:48.520 --> 08:51.840
Has he talked about the period of time
before he killed his wife?

08:51.920 --> 08:53.840
We've talked about his early years, yeah.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.760
-No.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.920
Has he committed any?

08:59.200 --> 09:00.240
Where'd you meet?

09:00.320 --> 09:03.320
Sometimes in the open prison he's in.
Sometimes in town.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.520
Alone?

09:04.600 --> 09:06.240
-Him. No, he's always
got some bloke with him.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.880
The guy who runs the bakery.

09:12.040 --> 09:15.320
<i>So as far as you're aware,</i>
<i>he's never left unattended?</i>

09:15.400 --> 09:17.920
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

09:54.240 --> 09:55.280
Hi, Steve.

09:59.440 --> 10:02.200
Hey, oi, Ashley, er,
the Chief Super's looking for you.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.520
-Yes.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.000
DI Tim Williamson.
You wanted to see me.

10:11.080 --> 10:14.160
The man in the reception said
it had to have been 24 hours

10:14.240 --> 10:15.600
before you could do anything?

10:15.680 --> 10:16.880
Yeah, that is normal procedure,

10:16.960 --> 10:18.840
unless there's evidence
a crime has been committed.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.440
Well, she didn't take her wallet,
keys, or phone.

10:22.520 --> 10:25.480
No clothes are missing.
Her car's still in the drive.

10:25.560 --> 10:27.200
What more do you need?

10:27.280 --> 10:29.320
-Yesterday.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.120
How did she seem?

10:31.200 --> 10:32.600
Usual self.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.600
Well, she wasn't depressed,
upset about something?

10:35.680 --> 10:36.720
No.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.800
Was she on any medication, taking drugs?

10:38.880 --> 10:40.160
No.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.800
-No, never.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.480
Can you think of any reason
why she might do so now, voluntarily? I want you to start looking into this
immediately.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.800
That's not how this works.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.960
You know who we are?

10:54.040 --> 10:56.680
-It doesn't matter.
-I think you'll find it does.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.600
Well, I'll need to take this up
with my boss.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.880
Then let's do that.
I'll come with you.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.360
Okay.

11:31.480 --> 11:32.920
Those from another Sinnr date?

11:34.040 --> 11:36.800
-Yeah, I worked really hard for 'em.
-I bet you did.

11:36.880 --> 11:40.560
Look, if you're married
and you cheat you deserve it. Okay?

11:40.640 --> 11:41.920
Mmm-hmm.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.600
All right, forensic report
from Benjamin Williams' flat.

12:14.680 --> 12:16.960
Same plastic bag, tape,
cable ties, the lot.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.840
No DNA or finger prints yet.
Have we got yours?

12:23.720 --> 12:25.280
Well, you attend crime scenes,
Marcella.

12:25.360 --> 12:26.520
-Get it done.
All right,

12:26.600 --> 12:28.320
there was nothing on the CCTV
from the shop downstairs.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.680
Camera was in the wrong angle.

12:29.760 --> 12:32.160
It didn't pick up anyone
going in or out of those flats.

12:32.240 --> 12:34.400
There's nothing
about anyone breaking in there.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.480
Do they just let him in?

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
No, they don't have to let him in.
They just open the door.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.840
He shoves them inside,
and then closes the door behind him.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.880
No, the victims were found
a long way from the front door.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.120
No signs of struggle.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.640
He's already there when they get home.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.400
Ah!

13:35.440 --> 13:36.520
You're late.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.960
Er, a client called,
so I popped in on the way.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.160
All right.

13:43.720 --> 13:44.720
Come here.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.000
-Hi.
-Hey.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.560
They're all there.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.600
-I wasn't counting.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.840
Did you get my message?

13:56.920 --> 13:59.920
-My text about Grace Gibson.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.080
No. What?

14:01.160 --> 14:02.680
She's gone missing.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.440
I thought I'd give Henry a call.
See if he wants to meet up.

14:06.520 --> 14:07.600
Oh, okay.

14:08.520 --> 14:10.000
You just got home.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.800
I'm, er...
gonna go lie down for a bit.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.200
-I didn't really sleep last night.
-Mmm-hmm.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.200
-Noisy hotel.
-Okay.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.440
Yep.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.760
Just give me a nudge
when the food's ready.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.320
-Yep.
-Thanks.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.880
Yep.

14:45.480 --> 14:46.560
Tim?

14:47.560 --> 14:49.040
No.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.680
-Hey.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.720
Oh, I did hear something
about you being back.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.680
-Oh, it's so good to see you.
-And you.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.400
How are you?
And the kids

14:57.480 --> 15:01.120
I'm good. Erm, Emma's 13. Edward's 11.
Both at boarding school,

15:01.200 --> 15:02.800
so I don't get to see them
as much as I'd like, but...

15:02.880 --> 15:04.120
Oh, that must be tough.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.880
Yeah.
It was Jason's idea.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.200
And Jason?
Is he, er, still at Gibson's?

15:08.280 --> 15:10.360
-Well, I'm heading over there now.

15:10.440 --> 15:11.840
Grace Gibson's gone missing.

15:12.840 --> 15:15.520
Yeah, she's only been gone one night,
but we're looking into it.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.720
-Well, nothing most likely.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.800
Only I'm going to spend hours
arriving at that conclusion.

15:21.720 --> 15:22.920
Listen, we should, erm...

15:23.000 --> 15:25.040
we should get lunch or something.
Catch up. Soon.

15:25.120 --> 15:26.640
Yeah. That'd be great.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.320
-Great seeing you.
-You, too.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.360
You're okay.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.280
Henry Gibson?

16:38.360 --> 16:39.920
DI Tim Williamson.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.880
-Erm, no, we haven't.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.360
-But about your sister's disappearance--
-Half-sister.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.160
-Same father.
-I see.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.800
Er, your mother...
Well, your stepmother,

16:48.880 --> 16:51.160
said you were at Grace's house
this morning.

16:51.240 --> 16:52.960
Yes, that's right.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.720
Was there anything you saw there
that gave you cause for concern?

16:55.800 --> 16:58.120
-Object missing,

16:58.200 --> 17:01.360
something having been moved,
signs of someone having been there.

17:02.280 --> 17:05.800
No, no.
I've not been to her place very often.

17:05.880 --> 17:08.200
So you should...
you should probably talk to Jason.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.640
Backland. The head of legal.
He was with me.

17:12.560 --> 17:13.880
They're, erm...

17:15.160 --> 17:17.320
They're in a relationship.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.520
-Yeah, but no one here knows.

17:20.600 --> 17:23.560
And Sylvie wouldn't approve,
so maybe you could keep that to yourself.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.640
-Mmm, yeah.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.280
I mean, we...

17:28.360 --> 17:30.200
we tell each other most things.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.520
Oh. Then I've come to the right person.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.000
-No.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.720
Can I get you anything?

17:47.440 --> 17:49.280
-No, thank you.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.720
I ought to go back to work.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.880
They can manage a day without you.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.440
Do you think it has anything
to do with the company?

18:04.440 --> 18:06.760
Well, maybe she's been kidnapped.
You do hear about that happening.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.280
-We're not in South America.
-All the same,

18:08.360 --> 18:10.480
-we have assets--
-I don't want to speculate,

18:10.560 --> 18:11.640
and neither should you.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.800
Mark, have you got a second?

18:26.960 --> 18:29.000
-Sure.
-CCTV wasn't really that big

18:29.080 --> 18:30.320
when I was here before.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.320
-Erm...

18:34.520 --> 18:37.160
-Access to the films.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.080
No, not really.
I just wanna learn.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.520
Okay. All right.
Well, if we start looking in...

18:42.600 --> 18:45.560
Rule number one...

18:49.600 --> 18:50.800
Right, there's been an assault.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.160
Masked man inside a flat
when the owner came home.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.720
No signs of forced entry.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.440
-Apparently the perpetrator ran off

18:56.520 --> 18:58.920
when he was stabbed in the shoulder
with a pair of scissors.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.040
Take Alex with you,
and find out what you can.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.320
<i>What did she want?</i>
<i>Just to know how CCTV works.</i>

19:06.400 --> 19:08.920
<i>Any particular aspect?</i>
<i>No, just in general.</i>

19:09.000 --> 19:11.320
Marcella?

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
When you find out,
let me know.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.120
Okay.

19:17.320 --> 19:19.720
<i>Got it.</i>
<i>We'll send a uniform for him shortly.</i>

19:22.080 --> 19:23.560
Okay, thanks.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.120
<i>Two...</i>

19:29.200 --> 19:30.240
<i>Three...</i>

19:30.320 --> 19:31.600
<i>350, all right?</i>

19:40.920 --> 19:42.040
Oi, Lea?

19:42.680 --> 19:45.560
How about a lot of drinks?
On me.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.600
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.760
-Yeah, he's downstairs.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.240
Okay, thanks.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.400
Sorry, I'm late.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.000
Why? It doesn't matter.
You're here now.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.840
-That's the main thing. Well, you said it would be worth it.

20:37.360 --> 20:39.880
The police had a talk with me today.

20:42.920 --> 20:45.120
-You. Someone called Marcella Backland.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.880
What did she want?

20:54.040 --> 20:56.440
She wanted to know about our meetings.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.560
Why does she want to know
about our meetings? Because--

21:04.640 --> 21:06.160
She's persecuting me.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.520
Harassing me.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.520
Because of what
you did to your wife? Or...

21:12.320 --> 21:13.360
is it something else?

21:19.120 --> 21:21.440
The police are here.
They want to talk to you.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.800
-Yeah.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.080
Uniformed officers.

21:24.160 --> 21:27.040
One minute. Just...
I don't think they're gonna wait.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.360
-Okay.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.280
You know, I can tell you
a lot more the next time we meet.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.600
When will that be?

21:42.720 --> 21:43.800
Whenever.

21:45.520 --> 21:48.640
What's the boyfriend going to say about
you meeting up with me the whole time?

21:50.120 --> 21:51.480
I haven't got one.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.000
Now get going.

21:58.040 --> 21:59.760
I'll give you a call soon.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.440
Yeah.

22:20.680 --> 22:21.960
Well, thanks for coming in.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.240
-Sure.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.240
What're you doing here?

22:44.320 --> 22:46.320
A colleague of mine has gone missing.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.600
Grace. Sylvie's daughter.

22:48.680 --> 22:49.920
Why're they talking to you about it?

22:52.800 --> 22:55.240
They're... questioning everyone.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.680
-Not yet.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.800
Look, I've got to get back.

22:59.880 --> 23:03.520
Erm, the weekend when the kids
get back from school...

23:05.320 --> 23:06.880
do you wanna come over and talk?

23:06.960 --> 23:08.120
I know we should,

23:08.200 --> 23:10.560
but I'm up to my eyes,
and then there's Grace.

23:11.200 --> 23:14.000
-She's on the executive committee.

23:14.080 --> 23:16.080
I've worked with her for years.
It affects me.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.600
Of course.

23:23.480 --> 23:24.960
Let's talk some other time.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.080
Thanks.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.240
You don't give up.

23:58.280 --> 24:00.000
-Because you're wrong.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.680
You know I didn't have to come.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.240
Take your shirt off.

24:12.600 --> 24:13.680
Why?

24:14.880 --> 24:17.680
-'Cause I want you to.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.280
No. You'd have to arrest me.

24:23.800 --> 24:25.960
Bring some kind of charge.
Make it official.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.480
Use force.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.840
Only for that you'd have to have
a lot more to go on.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.680
Not on very firm ground,
are you, Marcella?

24:36.760 --> 24:39.480
I reckon you seem a bit... desperate.

24:40.960 --> 24:42.320
Coming down to the bakery...

24:43.320 --> 24:44.760
talking to Maddy.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.000
Asking her questions.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.880
-All right, Peter.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.120
All right.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.680
Don't touch me... please.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.600
You told the police about Grace and me.

25:18.480 --> 25:19.520
Yes, I did.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.760
There was a reason
we were keeping it secret.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.760
Well, don't worry,
I haven't said a word to Her Majesty.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.720
Do you know where she is?

25:36.360 --> 25:38.400
-'Cause you're sleeping with her.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.320
Well, don't you think
I would have said something?

25:44.360 --> 25:47.520
Yeah.
Yeah, of course you would.

25:48.680 --> 25:49.960
Yeah.

25:52.840 --> 25:55.040
Sorry. I'm just worried.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.280
-Hiya.
-Hi.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.920
-We haven't. No, this is, erm...

27:06.000 --> 27:08.200
It's about something else.
Could I come in for a minute?

27:08.280 --> 27:09.320
Yeah.

27:11.400 --> 27:12.920
-No, I'm fine.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.920
-No, thanks. Really.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.200
Erm, what do you want?

27:25.520 --> 27:27.920
Well, I'm, er...
I'm not supposed to say.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.560
It's just I felt that...

27:30.400 --> 27:32.360
-Well...

27:34.880 --> 27:38.240
Jason came up in the investigation
into Grace Gibson's disappearance.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.400
They, er...

27:42.040 --> 27:43.720
Well, they were in a relationship.

27:49.480 --> 27:51.880
Yeah.
I thought as much.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.520
I just didn't know who.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.400
He says you were separated.

27:57.480 --> 27:58.760
Er...

27:58.840 --> 28:00.480
Yeah, you could say that.

28:03.840 --> 28:05.320
He took me out for dinner...

28:07.360 --> 28:10.320
and in the middle of the main course
he told me that he was leaving me.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.080
So I wouldn't make a fuss, but I did.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.600
And then he put me in a taxi,
and he went back to work.

28:16.800 --> 28:21.280
Yeah. So if you examine his car
and you find dents and broken glass,

28:21.360 --> 28:22.440
that'll be me.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.280
Don't know what to say.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.640
Do you want that beer now?

28:30.280 --> 28:31.480
Yes, please.

28:35.680 --> 28:38.520
-Cheers, mate. Good to see you.
-Cheers.

28:39.840 --> 28:42.200
Not likely to be the most
entertaining company, I'm afraid.

28:42.280 --> 28:43.320
Hmm.

28:44.480 --> 28:46.640
We can be worried together, huh?

28:47.560 --> 28:51.240
Best case scenario,
she's just lying low somewhere.

28:51.320 --> 28:52.800
I'm sure she is.
She's probably just fine.

28:52.880 --> 28:53.920
Hey, did I tell you

28:54.000 --> 28:56.480
that there was a woman in my AA group
that went missing?

28:56.560 --> 28:57.760
Carol Fincher.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.920
-She was gone for, like, seven weeks.
-Yann, please don't.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.080
They found her murdered

29:01.160 --> 29:03.400
when her body started oozing
through the floor into the shop below.

29:03.480 --> 29:04.640
Please shut up.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.560
What? We're just talking
about people who are missing.

29:06.640 --> 29:07.960
No, we weren't talking about "people."

29:08.040 --> 29:09.520
We were talking about Grace.  Sorry.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.760
Sorry.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.040
Excuse me.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.560
Smoke?
-Smoke.

29:32.120 --> 29:34.200
Can you wait for the money
till next month?

29:36.160 --> 29:37.320
It's not a loan.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.160
It's just things have been
so bloody slow this month.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.680
-No.

29:40.760 --> 29:42.040
I can...
No, don't interrupt me.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.560
I can give you a job,
at the company.

29:44.640 --> 29:47.360
A real job. A consultancy,
not a non-charity in disguise.

29:47.920 --> 29:51.160
They're looking for an IT guy
right now, you in?

29:51.240 --> 29:53.320
Yeah, all right.

29:54.640 --> 29:57.720
-Thanks... again.
-Hey, hey...

29:58.720 --> 29:59.960
it's all right.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.400
Yeah. We gotta help each other.

30:05.800 --> 30:09.840
You know, Grace was trying to help me
before she... disappeared.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.400
And I blew up at her.

30:12.360 --> 30:13.760
Dude, she'll be back.

30:14.400 --> 30:15.480
Yeah?

30:15.560 --> 30:18.120
There you are.
You guys left these in the bar.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.800
Any ideas how many drinks
get spiked in pubs every year?

30:20.880 --> 30:22.080
Are we in danger?

30:22.160 --> 30:25.720
Don't you have to be prettier,
and younger, and a woman?

30:26.960 --> 30:29.320
Who knows?
Plenty of crazies out there.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.600
-Oh, Yann!
Yeah.

30:32.680 --> 30:33.720
Yann!

30:39.240 --> 30:40.280
Thanks.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.200
It's just like the good old days.

30:53.760 --> 30:54.920
The case...

30:56.400 --> 30:58.160
It's taking over.

30:58.240 --> 31:00.280
-Peter Cullen...
-I know it's him.

31:01.480 --> 31:03.200
-Don't be too sure.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.600
You know, it's not a bad idea
to take a step back every now and then.

31:07.680 --> 31:09.880
That's not really me, is it?

31:10.800 --> 31:12.840
I know.
But maybe this time--

31:12.920 --> 31:15.480
It's not the same.
The Hexton case was different.

31:17.880 --> 31:19.240
That was different.

31:20.200 --> 31:21.240
Okay. Okay.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.040
I should get going.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.920
-Thanks for the beer.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.400
Yes.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.160
But I'm not going to.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.320
Why'd you come?

31:46.240 --> 31:48.200
'Cause I care about you.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.680
And that's why I'm going.

31:51.720 --> 31:53.000
I'll see you tomorrow.

32:38.560 --> 32:41.120
Earrings, bracelet,
your mate's got the watch. There you go.

32:41.200 --> 32:42.400
It's all she sold me.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.640
Yeah, it's Carol Fincher's.
Liz Harper's.

32:50.720 --> 32:52.280
And Benjamin Williams's watch.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.640
His brother recognises it,
and the inscription confirms it.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.720
Who sold you this?

32:57.760 --> 32:59.320
-A girl.
What girl?

33:00.440 --> 33:02.760
She's supposed to show you
some form of ID, isn't she?

33:02.840 --> 33:03.880
Well, yeah, but--

33:03.960 --> 33:05.480
-No.

33:06.360 --> 33:07.960
But you have seen her, haven't you?

33:10.480 --> 33:13.360
Identifying this woman is top priority.

33:13.440 --> 33:14.840
What do we know about her

33:14.920 --> 33:16.360
She may have been in trouble before.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.880
I've got the guy from the pawnshop
looking through mugshots.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.280
We're trying to get fingerprints
off the bracelet,

33:20.360 --> 33:21.440
the watch and the earrings.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.320
Good, 'cause she's now
our lead suspect.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.840
Serial killers don't take
trophies to sell them.

33:25.920 --> 33:27.000
They've got a different value to them.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.640
How do you explain
this jewellery, then?

33:28.720 --> 33:30.440
My guess is that she stole
them from him.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.920
Well, if that was the case,
the killer's gonna try and find her.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.280
Well then, make sure
we find her first!

33:45.640 --> 33:46.840
Hi. What would you like?

33:56.160 --> 33:57.200
Yeah.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.000
I'm not gonna hurt myself,
so you can forget about that.

34:50.880 --> 34:51.920
Ah... Mmm.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.280
I like you, too.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.480
You don't know what I smell like.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.200
Is this to pick up
Peter Cullen yesterday?

35:54.280 --> 35:56.280
Yes.

35:56.360 --> 35:57.520
I wanted to talk to him.

35:57.600 --> 35:58.800
If all we want to do is talk to someone,

35:58.880 --> 36:01.080
we ask them to come in
and see us voluntarily.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.480
He's involved in this, Laura.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.120
You don't know that.
-The murders began when he got in touch

36:05.200 --> 36:07.240
-with the outside world again.
He's supervised constantly.

36:07.320 --> 36:09.400
He's been seeing a psychologist
in prison for several years.

36:09.480 --> 36:10.560
I've read his report.

36:10.640 --> 36:13.520
He's filed a complaint
for harassment. His lawyers are involved.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.160
We have no grounds
to continue investigating him.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.280
Yes, we do.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.520
Peter shows signs
of a personality disorder.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.640
-An unstable self-image.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.400
He switches rapidly
between emotional states

36:22.480 --> 36:26.440
and often demonstrates intense rage
that's out of all proportion to the case.

36:26.520 --> 36:28.920
Dominant traits,
an intense fear of abandonment

36:29.000 --> 36:31.280
and an inability to handle rejection.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.240
I'm sorry, that's not enough.

36:33.320 --> 36:35.160
Stay away from Cullen.
No contact at all. Can I at least show him this,
see how he responds?

36:37.160 --> 36:39.040
We weren't asking for a favour,
DS Backland.

36:39.120 --> 36:40.840
Stay away from him.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.320
<i>I'm so sorry this has happened.</i>

37:20.720 --> 37:21.760
Why aren't you both here?

37:22.680 --> 37:25.160
Because Dad's at work.
He's busy.

37:26.480 --> 37:29.040
Are we going to be living
in two different places now?

37:31.600 --> 37:32.960
Yeah, probably.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.360
But that doesn't mean
that we're not gonna

37:37.440 --> 37:39.400
spend lots and lots of time together,
the four of us.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.360
-We're still your parents.
Are you sad?

37:42.320 --> 37:43.400
Honey, of course I'm sad.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.520
So this wasn't your idea?

37:51.000 --> 37:52.280
He left you...

37:53.400 --> 37:54.520
didn't he?

37:56.960 --> 37:58.160
He left you.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.760
What did you do?

38:06.520 --> 38:08.120
I didn't do anything.

38:09.160 --> 38:11.400
Things like this just happen sometimes.

38:14.120 --> 38:15.720
Has he met someone else?

38:17.960 --> 38:19.000
No.

38:20.640 --> 38:22.240
So he just had enough?

38:25.640 --> 38:26.800
Erm...

38:29.560 --> 38:33.440
Would you like it if I talked
to the school and asked if you can...

38:33.520 --> 38:35.560
come home with me for a few days?

38:36.280 --> 38:37.720
No, thanks.

38:38.520 --> 38:39.600
I'm good.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.120
Edward?

38:45.040 --> 38:46.880
I guess I'd rather stay here, too. You don't wanna come home with Mummy?

38:57.000 --> 38:59.680
Hey... come here.
It's okay.

39:25.120 --> 39:26.240
Cara? Cara.

39:37.480 --> 39:39.200
Since when did we start using that?

39:42.200 --> 39:43.680
-Mmm-hmm.

39:47.720 --> 39:49.120
Cara...

39:49.200 --> 39:50.640
-Some guy threatened to kill me.

39:51.560 --> 39:52.880
Someone I'd nicked stuff from.

39:52.960 --> 39:54.560
He threatened me on the webcam.

39:54.640 --> 39:57.520
They chat a load of shit online.
He's not gonna do anything in person.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.640
He doesn't know who you are, does he?

40:03.360 --> 40:06.480
There are eight million people
in London, Cara.

40:07.800 --> 40:10.280
There's no way
he could ever find out who you are.

40:10.360 --> 40:11.680
Come here.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.600
<i>Are you</i>
<i>my husband's girlfriend?</i>

41:44.000 --> 41:45.840
<i>You should be speaking to Jason.</i>

41:45.920 --> 41:47.440
<i>Are you seeing my husband?</i>

41:50.440 --> 41:51.480
<i>Look at me!</i>

41:53.760 --> 41:57.440
<i>Go speak to Jason. Calm. Calm down.</i>

42:25.360 --> 42:27.320
<i>You tell me.</i>
<i>I wanna hear it from you.</i>

42:27.400 --> 42:29.000
<i>Are you seeing my fucking husband?</i>

42:29.080 --> 42:30.960
<i>I don't have anything to say.</i>

42:31.040 --> 42:32.520
<i>You need to speak to Jason.</i>

42:55.760 --> 42:57.480
Come on!

43:02.280 --> 43:04.240
Think.

43:19.280 --> 43:21.000
<i>You're a fucking God damn liar!</i>

43:21.080 --> 43:22.920
<i>Stay away from me!</i>

43:36.760 --> 43:38.240
<i>Look at me!</i>

44:07.760 --> 44:10.000
<i>No!</i>

44:33.520 --> 44:35.000
Oh!
