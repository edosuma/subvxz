00:33.158 --> 00:37.117
What we're proposing isn't politics,
but a dream.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.989
The dream of being free, at last.

00:41.416 --> 00:44.909
Free from the State, from bureaucracy,
from history.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.380
What's going on?

01:03.564 --> 01:05.305
What's going on?

01:10.320 --> 01:12.778
Leonardo Notte,
we're arresting you for murder.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.857
There must be a mistake,
I've not done anything.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.117
I've not done anything, let me go!

01:19.329 --> 01:21.115
I've not done anything!

01:22.207 --> 01:24.414
Please, no, please!

01:24.585 --> 01:26.201
I've not done anything!

01:28.380 --> 01:29.336
Let me go!

01:43.228 --> 01:46.141
NOVEMBER 2nd

01:54.906 --> 01:57.614
You shouldn't be here.
You need authorization.

02:01.496 --> 02:04.158
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

02:17.929 --> 02:20.216
You were going to cover that
with cement.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.387
- What?
- You said that'd be a car park.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.684
Are you checking up on me?

02:36.490 --> 02:38.481
Is everything okay?

02:42.621 --> 02:45.409
Have you ever done terrible things?

02:45.582 --> 02:47.789
All the time.

02:48.669 --> 02:54.005
Come with me to my office,
I need to pass by there.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.981
Well? What did you do
that's so terrible?

05:19.444 --> 05:21.060
I have to go.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.771
You're not sleeping here?

05:26.243 --> 05:29.201
I've not been sleeping at all
recently.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.198
Nightmares?

05:31.623 --> 05:35.207
I dreamt that Di Pietro
was coming to arrest me.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.210
Promise me something...

05:39.381 --> 05:42.999
Whatever you've done,
don't ever tell me about it.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.593
How come you didn't go away?

05:50.809 --> 05:52.766
A few things changed.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.560
For better or for worse?

05:57.107 --> 05:59.144
For better and for worse.

06:11.997 --> 06:16.036
You're not allowed there,
it's private property!

06:17.460 --> 06:19.121
Get out!

06:20.130 --> 06:22.792
- Are you the guardian?
- Who are you?

06:24.509 --> 06:25.795
What's that?

06:26.761 --> 06:28.923
The first half.

06:29.973 --> 06:33.136
For the rest, call me when
they pick up the consignment.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.195
Pietro!

06:55.790 --> 06:57.406
Good afternoon.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.996
Well, I wouldn't say "good"...

07:04.215 --> 07:05.330
Well?

07:06.384 --> 07:09.001
Did you think about my proposal?

07:09.804 --> 07:13.047
Joining the Christian Democrats?
Well, I dunno...

07:14.184 --> 07:19.179
The CD party is struggling now,
but it has nine lives like cats.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.810
Everyone keeps going on about
the Second Republic...

07:22.984 --> 07:25.601
Do you know what that means?

07:25.820 --> 07:29.563
That you'll get the scraps
from the first one. That's what.

07:31.576 --> 07:35.194
The parliamentary authorization
committee voted in favor.

07:35.413 --> 07:40.408
When a big party like the CD
suffers leadership troubles,

07:40.585 --> 07:45.375
what follows is the settling
of internal affairs.

07:45.590 --> 07:51.006
- Did a colleague betray you?
-I can't say. Onofri, the Dorothean.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.806
Never trust those who repent
in church.

07:56.017 --> 08:02.229
And even with the committee's approval
the Chamber's decision is needed.

08:02.941 --> 08:05.729
I've got an abacus at home,
you've seen it.

08:05.902 --> 08:09.611
I used it to count how many friends
I have in Parliament.

08:09.781 --> 08:13.399
I have plenty, some above suspicion.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.995
I'll walk up.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.996
It's not time for the new men yet!

08:30.218 --> 08:35.179
Can you hear the heartbeat?
There's another heart inside you.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.352
I'm glad you changed your mind.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.305
I said "maybe"!

08:46.609 --> 08:49.977
Are you one of those Catholics
who want to convert people?

08:50.196 --> 08:52.608
You've made the right decision.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.745
- I'll take that.
- Thanks.

09:08.590 --> 09:13.050
- <i>Hello? Caste/lo speaking.</i>
- <i>Giuliani, it's me. ls it</i> a <i>bad time?</i>

09:13.720 --> 09:16.007
<i>Yes... No, no, what is it?</i>

09:16.723 --> 09:20.182
- I <i>wanted to talk to you.</i>
<i>- Me too, I've got important news.</i>

09:20.351 --> 09:23.013
- You're pregnant?
- No!

09:23.188 --> 09:26.977
<i>- I'm coming to Rome soon.
- Hi. see.</i>

09:27.901 --> 09:31.189
- <i>You</i> can't talk.
<i>- No, I'm in the newsroom.</i>

09:31.362 --> 09:33.979
<i>- Can you call me tonight?
- Oi course, sure.</i>

09:34.199 --> 09:36.611
<i>Sorry. Bye, speak later.</i>

09:37.869 --> 09:39.325
Bye.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.185
I wanted to show you this.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.062
Of course.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.603
Don't you want to know what it is?

10:12.278 --> 10:13.689
Yes.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.069
Certainly.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.329
All right.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.887
TO SAVE THE BANANA REPUBLIC

11:14.549 --> 11:16.290
Don't worry.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.007
You should be running more checks.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.257
They're saying he's a drug dealer.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.150
What will it be next?

12:11.814 --> 12:13.851
Hi.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.686
Excuse the mess,
I'm never home.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.025
So what's this important news?

12:21.241 --> 12:23.357
I found more contaminated blood.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.988
Thousands of liters of plasma.

12:27.538 --> 12:30.496
- Where?
- In a storeroom out of town.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.120
Hidden in dozens of refrigerator rooms.

12:34.671 --> 12:38.255
Why haven't you told anyone?
Have it seized.

12:38.383 --> 12:42.217
It'd take months to prove
Zenit and Lemures are the same thing.

12:42.345 --> 12:46.634
If I wait for them to deliver it
to Zenit, I'll catch them red-handed.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.513
How will you know
when it'll be collected?

12:52.313 --> 12:54.771
- I bribed someone.
-No, I didn't hear that.

12:54.941 --> 12:59.902
Giuliani, listen to me,
my investigation isn't legal...

13:00.989 --> 13:03.356
I'm your anonymous informer, right?

13:03.616 --> 13:05.983
Why don't you take the credit?

13:14.544 --> 13:16.581
Hello? Castello speaking.

13:19.841 --> 13:22.333
Yes, I'll be right there.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.426
Balzamo is dead.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.680
When?

13:45.199 --> 13:48.988
Rocchetta? I called this morning.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.202
- Are you Bosco?
- Yes.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.989
Excuse me, come over to my desk.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.118
Here it is.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.001
- You wanted the Nobile file, right?
- Yes.

14:04.802 --> 14:08.215
Why are you interested in what
the authorization committee does?

14:08.765 --> 14:12.599
If I vote for someone to be arrested,
I want to know what they've done.

14:12.810 --> 14:17.270
You're the only one.
Nobile did loads of dodgy deals!

14:19.192 --> 14:22.810
Did he do what Onofri said or not?

14:22.987 --> 14:26.776
You know what I think?
That Onofri got caught...

14:26.991 --> 14:31.736
so now he fancies
screwing things up for an enemy.

14:32.789 --> 14:37.249
CDs are like mafiosos,
they fight amongst each other.

14:37.543 --> 14:41.127
- So he's innocent.
- What do you care?

14:41.381 --> 14:43.213
Let's get rid of this lot.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.128
Let's get rid of them...

14:46.511 --> 14:48.548
Thanks, Rocchetta.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.343
<i>This morning in Milan
at San Raffaele hospital,</i>

14:56.604 --> 15:00.598
<i>the Socialist Party treasurer,
Vincenzo Balzamo, passed away.</i>

15:00.817 --> 15:04.811
<i>The country is in shock following
the death of the Socialist Balzamo</i>

15:04.904 --> 15:07.862
<i>who died this morning in Milan
at San Raffaele hospital</i>

15:07.990 --> 15:10.197
<i>after suffering a heart attack.</i>

15:10.368 --> 15:13.577
<i>His condition had worsened
during the night...</i>

15:13.788 --> 15:15.199
Don't worry.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.782
I'm not armed.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.411
Pastore, what do you want?

15:24.424 --> 15:28.008
Now they'll blame everything on him,
right?

15:29.554 --> 15:32.012
What do you care?

15:33.015 --> 15:35.757
I want to be back on your team, sir.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.429
Another one!

15:47.321 --> 15:52.782
I read an article your friend wrote
about Mainaghi, have you seen it?

15:53.369 --> 15:55.531
Yes, it's all true.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.364
We can get the bigwigs
at the Department of Health.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.367
You can't just do as you please.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.999
Will you take me back?

16:05.256 --> 16:09.625
<i>Craxi and Balzamo had been
close friends for over twenty years.</i>

16:09.844 --> 16:12.506
<i>We speak to an emotional Craxi.</i>

16:12.722 --> 16:17.011
<i>For months he'd been
in an anxious state.</i>

16:17.185 --> 16:20.018
<i>I did my best to encourage him</i>

16:21.272 --> 16:23.354
<i>to understand that sooner or later</i>

16:23.608 --> 16:27.977
<i>the situation would become
more tolerable, more feasible...</i>

16:28.196 --> 16:31.939
I taught my dog not to bother
coming back if he's caught no prey.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.615
Or I'll give him a beating.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.244
You want to come back, Pastore?

16:39.582 --> 16:42.165
Help me get to him then.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.247
Give me another one.

17:00.937 --> 17:03.975
- Did you go to rehearsals?
- Hi to you too!

17:05.191 --> 17:08.809
You shouldn't do strenuous stuff
in the first three months.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.978
I'll speak to the production team
tomorrow and tell them.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.954
- Come on!
- Come on...

17:23.876 --> 17:27.961
Listen, once I've had this darn baby
I'm going back to work on TV.

17:34.011 --> 17:38.130
Don't get any funny ideas about
me being a housewife, you got that?

17:38.975 --> 17:40.511
Say "I get it".

17:41.143 --> 17:43.259
I get it.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.261
Good.

17:47.358 --> 17:49.144
What are you reading?

17:49.277 --> 17:52.690
The documents for the authorization
to proceed against Nobile.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.363
Gaetano? What's he done?

17:56.576 --> 17:58.988
He's been accused of corruption.

18:00.204 --> 18:03.993
But it's his word against
that of another Christian Democrat

18:04.208 --> 18:06.575
from another faction,
who hates him.

18:06.794 --> 18:10.583
- Are they framing him?
- So it seems.

18:11.674 --> 18:14.587
Well, don't vote against him then.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.672
How can I do that?

18:17.763 --> 18:20.801
- What's wrong?
- I feel sick.

18:37.658 --> 18:41.526
NOVEMBER 27th

18:45.374 --> 18:49.709
In the name of the Italian people,
the Tribunal of Milan,

18:49.920 --> 18:55.791
based on article 317 and 319
of the Penal Code,

18:56.010 --> 18:59.503
declares the accused, Mario Chiesa,

18:59.722 --> 19:03.590
guilty of bribery and corruption

19:03.809 --> 19:07.598
and sentences him to six years
imprisonment,

19:08.189 --> 19:11.181
in addition to paying
the cost of the proceedings.

19:11.776 --> 19:16.236
The Court deems
that the accused must pay

19:17.198 --> 19:20.316
6 billion, 500 million liras

19:20.576 --> 19:23.568
as partial compensation
until the total amount

19:24.205 --> 19:26.788
is decided in the Civil Court.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.073
The Court is dismissed.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.597
Sir, are you going to appeal?

19:48.938 --> 19:52.306
Sir, can you answer my question?
Will you appeal or not?

20:00.324 --> 20:02.907
Why are you here?
Any news on the blood?

20:03.661 --> 20:07.370
Not yet. It's the first Clean Hands
trial and I wanted to be here.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.077
Di Pietro isn't happy, he wanted
a 10-year sentence.

20:10.209 --> 20:14.043
He's not happy because now that
Balzamo's dead, Craxi is safe again.

20:14.964 --> 20:18.832
Now that they have a scapegoat,
they'll never talk.

20:19.593 --> 20:23.177
Unless they find someone
who still has it in for Craxi

20:23.347 --> 20:25.338
and who has nothing to lose.

20:25.433 --> 20:28.095
GIACOMO MANCINI ISN'T MOVED:
IN HIS EYES BETTINO FAILED

20:28.185 --> 20:32.804
Someone like the Socialist Party's
old secretary. What do you want?

20:33.190 --> 20:35.352
I need a favor.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.368
Open the door, I know you're there.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.992
You know about this?

20:55.212 --> 20:57.499
- Meaning?
- Read it.

21:02.052 --> 21:05.010
IS MANCINI BEHIND THE KICKBACKS?
THE TEAM INVESTIGATES

21:06.599 --> 21:08.715
- No, I didn't...
- So how come your friend

21:08.809 --> 21:11.346
Giuliani Castello writes this crap?

21:12.021 --> 21:14.979
I saw you talking in court yesterday.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.981
Mancini's lawyer called me

21:21.572 --> 21:24.610
and asked me if it was true.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.367
I said:
"No, he's not being investigated."

21:27.787 --> 21:29.573
Of course he didn't believe me,

21:29.789 --> 21:34.579
then he said that Mancini wants
to give a voluntary statement.

21:36.212 --> 21:39.330
You told me to bring you Craxi
and I tried.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.831
A bluff?

21:44.345 --> 21:49.090
We have the results from the checks
we did on those accounts.

21:49.266 --> 21:51.348
From the Mainaghi case?

21:52.561 --> 21:55.178
From Mario Chiesa's kickback account.

21:55.356 --> 21:58.974
Another kickback was revealed
for a contract to build a clinic.

21:59.193 --> 22:02.356
So now I have to question Mainaghi.

22:05.533 --> 22:09.697
I'm just telling you because
I thought you'd want to know.

22:12.957 --> 22:15.949
In fact, why don't you question her?

22:25.177 --> 22:28.169
You know I got a right telling off
because of you?

22:28.347 --> 22:30.884
The news hasn't been confirmed.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.391
I hope it was worth it.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.146
I'm pleased.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.979
You owe me one.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.353
Bye, Luca.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.195
Here she is!

22:51.871 --> 22:53.862
This is my sister, Veronica.

22:56.667 --> 22:59.625
Careful, it's taken an hour
to make me look pretty.

23:02.923 --> 23:06.382
- They've done a good job.
- Yes, I look good.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.926
How about you?

23:10.973 --> 23:12.805
I've got some news.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.018
I bet I know what it is.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.603
Who told you?

23:20.232 --> 23:22.644
Well, I'm your big sister.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.361
<i>L</i> keep an eye on you!

23:27.823 --> 23:29.780
How come you're here?

23:29.992 --> 23:33.781
They saw me on TV during an interview
with some Clean Hands reporters

23:33.996 --> 23:37.785
and they said I'm expressive
and credible.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.369
They asked me to do a segment
that'll be part of "Buona Domenica".

23:43.505 --> 23:46.998
I've not stopped writing, tomorrow
I'm back at the prosecution office.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.800
What did you want to tell me?

23:53.724 --> 23:56.056
I need some advice.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.974
Good morning. Alessandra,
is everything ready next door?

24:00.189 --> 24:03.352
- Yes, Mrs. Cuccarini, it is.
- Good.

24:07.071 --> 24:09.278
She's interviewing me, you know.

24:09.990 --> 24:12.197
Shall we have a coffee?

24:12.785 --> 24:15.026
Some other time.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.570
You're busy now.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.323
I'll call you.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.871
See you. Goodbye.

24:42.356 --> 24:45.269
Did you see the videotape I gave you?

24:46.318 --> 24:48.559
Do you smoke?

24:49.405 --> 24:51.988
Only when I'm very cross.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.570
As a young man, you were a communist.

25:00.708 --> 25:04.793
I do my homework
on those who work for me.

25:06.088 --> 25:07.920
What was it that you preached?

25:08.132 --> 25:09.793
Oh yes...

25:10.801 --> 25:14.510
the liberation of work,
the right to enjoy things,

25:15.347 --> 25:17.805
desire as a form of liberation.

25:19.935 --> 25:23.599
But who actually achieved
those things?

25:24.356 --> 25:26.063
We did.

25:26.942 --> 25:30.981
And you think you have
something to teach me?

25:32.322 --> 25:33.983
Did you watch the video or not?

25:34.199 --> 25:38.443
You were supposed to do one thing
but you did another, with my money.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.320
Who gave you authorization?

25:44.043 --> 25:46.910
Answer me!
Who the hell gave you authorization?

25:50.966 --> 25:52.832
Did you watch it or not?

25:53.218 --> 25:55.630
You think you're so clever?

25:56.180 --> 25:58.171
Do you think you're a genius?

25:58.348 --> 26:03.809
I don't give a toss about you!
I need people who are trustworthy.

26:04.021 --> 26:05.978
- And I am.
- Really?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.811
My bank manager called me.

26:09.985 --> 26:12.352
He said you tried to withdraw
one billion liras,

26:12.613 --> 26:15.196
then you changed your mind and left.

26:16.450 --> 26:19.192
What the hell
were you planning to do?

26:27.628 --> 26:29.665
Did you watch the video or not?

26:29.880 --> 26:33.794
You're still the deluded narcissist
you were as a young man.

26:34.009 --> 26:37.377
And I want nothing more to do
with you, is that clear?

26:37.971 --> 26:41.635
- I've worked very hard for this job.
- I couldn't care less.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.392
You're fired.

26:55.405 --> 26:59.444
He could've axed us too,
but you covered for us. Thanks.

27:00.869 --> 27:03.577
- It was my idea.
- A goddamn brilliant idea!

27:03.747 --> 27:06.580
I'd imagined myself as
Minister of Joyous Living!

27:06.792 --> 27:11.002
What's the saying?
It's always the best who go...

27:15.425 --> 27:17.507
It's been a pleasure.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.010
Rachele...

27:27.729 --> 27:29.470
Gladly.

28:02.848 --> 28:05.010
<i>- Hello?
- Luca Pastors?</i>

28:05.184 --> 28:08.176
<i>- Yes.
- It's about that consignment.</i>

28:08.395 --> 28:10.978
<i>The truck's arrived to collect it.</i>

28:11.190 --> 28:14.308
Does the delivery note say
where it's going?

28:31.084 --> 28:32.825
Police!

28:33.003 --> 28:35.370
- Hold that consignment.
- What?

28:35.589 --> 28:40.800
- The consignment that just arrived!
- It's already gone in!

28:44.890 --> 28:48.383
- <i>We had</i> no <i>choice.</i>
- <i>You know how much we lost?</i>

28:48.936 --> 28:54.022
<i>I know you founded Lemures
to shift the blame for the blood.</i>

28:54.233 --> 28:56.349
<i>I said you were a smart girl.</i>

28:56.568 --> 28:58.559
That's why I destroyed that plasma.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.735
<i>The prosecutor wants to question me.
We just avoided</i>

29:02.950 --> 29:06.193
a huge scandal and you want to risk
more trouble for peanuts?

29:06.411 --> 29:09.403
- <i>What</i> if <i>they'd caught us?</i>
- <i>It wasn't peanuts...</i>

29:09.581 --> 29:12.414
I'm not going to jail for you.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.791
<i>We'd never have been caught.</i>

29:15.003 --> 29:17.995
<i>You're the one with scruples,
you're a milksop.</i>

29:18.215 --> 29:21.833
<i>- You're not like you're father.
- I'm looking after our interests.</i>

29:22.052 --> 29:24.168
<i>Next time check with me first.</i>

29:27.557 --> 29:29.173
Fuck you.

29:41.655 --> 29:45.865
DECEMBER 12th

29:45.993 --> 29:47.984
I-Hi.

29:50.205 --> 29:54.574
- Did they release you?
- Yes, awaiting trial.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.996
Good luck.

30:10.434 --> 30:12.050
Wait!

30:14.021 --> 30:16.308
Do you have something for me?

30:17.399 --> 30:21.188
- Have you run out of sugar?
- Do you have something?

30:22.279 --> 30:24.987
Didn't you notice I've lost my job?

30:25.615 --> 30:28.607
Well, that makes two of us.
Well?

30:29.161 --> 30:32.404
I'm sure you have
an emergency stash, dammit!

30:32.581 --> 30:34.788
Fuck off.

30:37.419 --> 30:39.376
Come on...

31:19.169 --> 31:21.376
I killed a man.

31:21.630 --> 31:25.339
I smashed his head in
with a carjack.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.674
I killed a man!

32:31.992 --> 32:34.780
Darling, what have I done?

32:38.415 --> 32:40.577
Forgive me.

32:47.841 --> 32:50.208
I forgive you.

34:47.335 --> 34:49.576
- Hello?
- Leo.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.371
Sorry for calling you at this time.

34:52.591 --> 34:55.583
<i>- Can't you sleep?
- N0, I need your help.</i>

34:55.802 --> 34:57.588
What for?

34:57.804 --> 35:01.138
<i>Emotional support,
the prosecutor wants to see me.</i>

35:01.433 --> 35:06.394
Please, help me, I have to put on
a hard-nosed front, I can't do it.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.347
<i>Okay, I'll come pick you up.</i>

35:09.566 --> 35:11.056
<i>Bye.</i>

35:37.344 --> 35:40.336
<i>- Hello?
- Bosco, it's Bortolotti.</i>

35:40.555 --> 35:44.389
<i>- What is it?
- You know what day it is today?</i>

35:44.601 --> 35:48.970
<i>We'll send your friend home today.
They're waiting for your vote.</i>

35:49.189 --> 35:50.975
<i>Don't forget.</i>

35:51.191 --> 35:55.401
<i>- Are you there? Did you hear me?
- Yes.</i>

35:55.612 --> 35:57.979
<i>And don't screw up!</i>

35:58.406 --> 36:00.397
<i>- All right.
- Don't be late.</i>

36:00.617 --> 36:01.982
Bye.

37:23.867 --> 37:28.737
Remember, let's stay united,
we've got to send him packing!

37:31.916 --> 37:33.498
Hello.

37:44.637 --> 37:47.379
Ready to do what you have to do?

38:05.784 --> 38:10.995
Honorable colleagues,
we are all present here today

38:11.206 --> 38:17.168
to vote for the authorization
to proceed against Gaetano Nobile.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.927
Make sure we all stay united.

38:29.182 --> 38:33.927
Dear colleagues! Please!
Proceed with the voting.

38:34.103 --> 38:36.390
I'm watching you, understood?

39:00.046 --> 39:02.583
Well done, Pietro.
You did the right thing.

39:02.799 --> 39:07.589
Honorable colleagues,
the voting is closed.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.182
Voters present: 612.

39:14.811 --> 39:17.803
Majority: 307.

39:17.981 --> 39:20.894
In favor: 311.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.808
Against: 301.

39:22.986 --> 39:26.945
You see? Your vote made
no damn difference anyway!

39:29.200 --> 39:34.195
The Chamber has approved
the authorization to proceed

39:34.414 --> 39:36.826
against Honorable Nobile.

39:45.091 --> 39:47.253
Well done, everyone!

39:56.644 --> 39:58.976
Now count to ten...

39:59.814 --> 40:01.304
One...

40:03.318 --> 40:04.774
TWO...

40:08.990 --> 40:10.651
three...

40:12.827 --> 40:14.443
four...

40:16.414 --> 40:17.996
five...

40:22.420 --> 40:24.002
six...

40:35.099 --> 40:37.386
Mr. Mancini, please, come in.

40:40.980 --> 40:42.812
Beatrice Mainaghi.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.776
You're doing the questioning?

40:48.988 --> 40:51.605
I'm sorry, you didn't make me
lose my job.

40:51.783 --> 40:54.195
Will you clarify the reason
for the summons?

40:54.786 --> 40:56.823
Just a few questions.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.912
It's my client's right to know
why he's here.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.782
I told you,
he's not being investigated.

41:02.001 --> 41:06.586
But I'm glad that Mr. Mancini
has volunteered to be a witness.

41:06.798 --> 41:09.506
A witness for what?

41:09.717 --> 41:13.711
You were a Socialist leader
for decades, you must know plenty!

41:14.722 --> 41:19.182
You must have some idea
about how Craxi ran the party.

41:19.394 --> 41:22.637
"Mr. Mainaghi paid 250 million liras,
in two installments,

41:22.855 --> 41:24.846
to gain authorization
for the construction

41:25.024 --> 41:27.857
of the new plastic surgery clinic.

41:28.069 --> 41:31.187
He wanted the work to begin
with no setbacks."

41:31.864 --> 41:36.529
Those are Franco De Roberti's words,
the assessor, now held on remand.

41:37.078 --> 41:39.194
Are we really talking about this?

41:39.580 --> 41:42.038
We're talking about a kickback, yes.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.207
I have to pay for my father's sins?

41:44.419 --> 41:46.786
Mr. De Roberti also says
that the Mainaghi firm

41:47.005 --> 41:50.498
continued to, let's say...
"cultivate their relationship."

41:50.717 --> 41:53.800
I don't know this man,
I've never given him money.

41:54.012 --> 41:56.003
Maybe not directly.

41:56.180 --> 42:00.344
Maybe someone else
makes decisions on your behalf.

42:03.604 --> 42:06.187
- Can we talk in private, please?
- No way.

42:06.399 --> 42:08.185
Go.

42:08.401 --> 42:11.234
At first I believed in Craxi,

42:11.779 --> 42:13.770
I helped him to become secretary.

42:13.990 --> 42:17.779
He was a nice lad,
I liked his energy and determination.

42:17.994 --> 42:22.534
I wanted to give him a chance,
it was just a temporary position.

42:22.957 --> 42:26.370
I'd never have imagined
we'd stoop so low.

42:26.544 --> 42:30.003
Do you mean the immoral way
he financed the party?

42:30.214 --> 42:33.923
I mean that you're destroying
our party with your blows.

42:34.385 --> 42:37.753
I feel terrible about what happened.

42:37.972 --> 42:40.589
Not only in this past year...

42:42.018 --> 42:45.010
But my opinion was no longer
of any importance.

42:45.188 --> 42:48.806
Balzamo was burdened with
a huge responsibility,

42:48.983 --> 42:53.147
managing illegal funds
worth billions for years,

42:53.571 --> 42:55.983
without the secretary knowing.

42:56.199 --> 43:00.614
A responsibility that unfortunately
Balzamo cannot elucidate.

43:00.787 --> 43:04.621
He went with dishonor,
I'm sorry about that too.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.083
Maybe because the dishonor
wasn't just his.

43:09.295 --> 43:15.007
I know you were forced to do that
conference against the prosecutor.

43:15.301 --> 43:17.212
BY Who?

43:20.890 --> 43:22.722
Tell me. It's just me and you.

43:23.059 --> 43:25.642
Who's really in control?

43:26.562 --> 43:28.678
Who's threatening you?

43:30.942 --> 43:33.855
- I can protect you.
- It's too late, I think.

43:35.613 --> 43:38.401
I did some decontaminating.

43:41.619 --> 43:46.409
You planted this the night you came
to say you wanted to be with me.

43:46.582 --> 43:48.994
And you expect me to trust you?

43:49.210 --> 43:54.205
The reason you came to see me
had nothing to do with me.

43:54.674 --> 43:57.541
You don't even like me.

44:00.221 --> 44:03.179
I've listened to you
all this time, Bibi.

44:04.600 --> 44:07.012
Even when it hurt me.

44:07.186 --> 44:10.178
I listened to you having sex
with another guy.

44:10.398 --> 44:12.389
I've listened to you cry.

44:13.442 --> 44:15.604
I've missed you, you know.

44:16.112 --> 44:19.730
When you destroyed that blood
I realized you hadn't changed.

44:21.409 --> 44:24.618
Mancini, you know that Balzamo
was simply following orders.

44:25.037 --> 44:26.778
Listen...

44:27.248 --> 44:29.865
do something for your party.

44:30.084 --> 44:33.202
If you were still the secretary,
what would you do?

44:33.421 --> 44:37.540
I'm no longer the secretary,
I'm no longer in charge.

44:37.758 --> 44:39.340
Craxi's in charge.

44:41.053 --> 44:42.339
Yes.

44:42.597 --> 44:45.180
Craxi runs the show.

44:46.184 --> 44:48.016
Yes.

44:48.186 --> 44:53.397
Craxi calls the shots, Craxi collects
the money, Craxi takes it.

44:56.068 --> 44:58.776
He can't not know...

45:01.490 --> 45:05.950
Craxi knew what Balzamo
was doing, he knew everything.

45:08.873 --> 45:13.162
- What do you want from me?
- That you confess your father's sins.

45:13.544 --> 45:15.455
And if I don't?

45:16.339 --> 45:18.797
We've got sufficient proof
to arrest you.

45:19.008 --> 45:21.796
How, with your recordings?

45:22.386 --> 45:25.595
You weren't working for
the prosecutor, they're illegal.

45:26.390 --> 45:28.802
Why continue being a victim
for your father?

45:29.018 --> 45:32.602
- You're a fine one to talk...
- Just walk away from it all.

45:33.189 --> 45:35.772
Send them all to hell,
what do you care?

45:38.527 --> 45:41.485
So you'll use those recordings
and get your revenge?

45:42.198 --> 45:44.656
You'll ruin the Clean Hands
operation too.

45:45.243 --> 45:49.578
Because that's what'll happen.
I don't think you'll use them.

45:49.872 --> 45:53.786
Why not handcuff me
and take me to jail?

45:57.797 --> 45:59.208
I knew it.

45:59.382 --> 46:03.216
I'll send my lawyer in
to finalize the report.

46:05.012 --> 46:07.424
Well, Mr. Mancini...

46:08.766 --> 46:10.803
- Good clay to you.
- Goodbye.

46:16.983 --> 46:19.600
Can you give us a statement?

46:27.368 --> 46:29.985
Thanks for coming,
I'm almost done.

46:30.204 --> 46:31.615
I'll wait here for you.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.582
Sign here, I'll see to the rest.

46:40.673 --> 46:43.540
Maybe one day we'll arrest you
for real.

46:48.639 --> 46:50.596
- Attilio...
- Hello.

47:02.153 --> 47:03.643
L-Hi.

47:04.196 --> 47:05.937
Take it easy.

47:10.119 --> 47:12.611
Shit, stop! The baby!

47:18.294 --> 47:20.786
There is no baby, I had an abortion.

47:25.176 --> 47:28.009
For that shitty program?

47:30.222 --> 47:32.054
<i>L</i> Pity you.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.682
It's not even what you want.

47:34.894 --> 47:37.352
How do you know what I want?

47:37.730 --> 47:42.224
In that shitty head of yours
you'll always be a slut.

47:43.152 --> 47:46.770
And you're just a loser
who'd marry a slut

47:46.989 --> 47:49.777
just to have someone
who pretends to love him.

48:27.780 --> 48:29.270
I'm sorry.

48:29.990 --> 48:32.652
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

48:37.790 --> 48:39.497
I'm sorry.

48:39.708 --> 48:41.494
It's over.

49:18.038 --> 49:20.826
DECEMBER 14th

49:30.885 --> 49:32.216
Here they are.

49:54.783 --> 49:56.820
Pastore, you lost the bet.

50:00.956 --> 50:03.744
- 1,000 liras.
- 1,000 liras.

50:04.293 --> 50:06.000
Come with me.

50:09.590 --> 50:11.581
We've got Craxi.

50:13.260 --> 50:14.546
We did it!

50:18.015 --> 50:21.178
Just imagine his face when he gets
his notice of investigation!

50:21.393 --> 50:23.475
Sir, it doesn't end here, does it?

50:23.938 --> 50:27.021
The Department of Health, yes.
But give me a smile.

50:52.216 --> 50:53.957
Goddamn crook!

51:49.565 --> 51:52.057
Let's proceed, seal off that area.

51:55.529 --> 51:57.315
POLICE INVESTIGATION

52:27.186 --> 52:29.348
I've seen those around, what is it?

52:30.606 --> 52:32.563
The future.

52:39.198 --> 52:40.780
Hello?

52:42.618 --> 52:44.404
Good evening.

52:44.995 --> 52:47.987
No, it's fine. Go ahead.

52:51.210 --> 52:52.996
Absolutely.

53:01.178 --> 53:03.010
Goodnight to you.

53:04.181 --> 53:06.013
Who was that?

53:13.607 --> 53:16.816
1993 is going to be a fantastic year.

53:21.365 --> 53:26.701
GO-GO, IT-A-LEE
