EDITED BY ASIFAKHEIR

01:34.000 --> 01:37.200
Security has been tightened.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.100
All borders have been placed on full alert.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.700
Exit visas have been suspended
for the entire week.

01:43.700 --> 01:49.100
In addition, we have assurance
from our undercover agents in the West

01:49.100 --> 01:53.100
that our actions to date
have gone completely undetected.

01:53.300 --> 01:56.200
All military leaves have been cancelled,

01:56.200 --> 01:59.700
and we have doubled the guard
around Dr Flammond.

01:59.700 --> 02:03.700
Finally, all systems are in readiness

02:03.700 --> 02:06.700
for deployment of the Polaris Mine.

02:06.700 --> 02:11.800
- As you ordered, General Streck.
- Well done, von Horst.

02:11.800 --> 02:15.200
By Sunday, the entire NATO
submarine fleet will be here

02:15.200 --> 02:18.700
on their manoeuvres,
and completely vulnerable.

02:20.500 --> 02:24.500
Major Crumpler, what is the progress
of our diversionary plan?

02:24.800 --> 02:29.300
The schedule for the cultural festival
is now complete, Herr General.

02:29.300 --> 02:33.300
You should be pleased to note,
that at your personal request,

02:33.500 --> 02:37.900
the Soviets have agreed to send
their celebrated tenor, Vladimir Biletnikov.

02:37.900 --> 02:43.200
Well done, Herr Major.
Then everything has gone to plan?

02:43.200 --> 02:47.200
Well, not exactly, mein General.

02:47.200 --> 02:51.800
The American, Leonard Bernstein,
unfortunately has had to cancel.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.600
They are sending
another performer in his place.

02:54.600 --> 02:59.700
In fact, we have just received
this copy of his most recent record.

02:59.700 --> 03:03.700
His name is...Nick Rivers.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.400
I'm sure he will be quite adequate.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.900
As long as the world's attention
is fixed on our cultural festival,

03:09.900 --> 03:11.900
no one will know what is about to happen.

03:13.700 --> 03:19.900
Once again, Germany will become
united under one rule. Ours!

03:19.900 --> 03:23.900
After Sunday there will be no one
to stop us.

<i>I've got a gun rack in my Chevy</i>

04:23.391 --> 04:26.251

04:26.252 --> 04:31.646

until the lifeguard takes our ammo away</i>

06:59.100 --> 07:01.500
What did he say?

07:01.500 --> 07:04.200
I think we're at the East German
checkpoint.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.800
Better have our passports ready.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.300
This is the first time rock music
has been allowed in this country.

07:10.300 --> 07:15.300
You're not just a performer. You're
an ambassador representing America.

07:15.300 --> 07:18.100
And above all, we play by their rules.

07:18.100 --> 07:24.800
Martin, I've been practising. How's this?
<i>Ist Ihre Tochter achtzehn, bitte?</i>

07:25.100 --> 07:28.300
- What does that mean?
- Is your daughter 18?

07:33.100 --> 07:35.400
Your papers, please.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.500
Mr. Nick Rivers.

07:43.500 --> 07:47.000
We have been awaiting the arrival
of the famous American singer.

<i>Come here. What have you got there?</i>

08:00.100 --> 08:03.800
- Where are they taking him?
- They are not taking him anywhere.

08:09.400 --> 08:13.300
Do not let your American curiosity
lead you into trouble.

08:13.300 --> 08:18.400
You are a guest here,
only because it serves our purposes.

08:18.400 --> 08:23.000
I suggest that during your stay, it would
be wise to keep to your own affairs.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.800
Good day.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.400
What the hell did you say to him?

08:38.400 --> 08:43.200
I just told him I'd put his name
on the Montgomery Ward mailing list.

08:45.300 --> 08:48.400
I'm sorry.
He's just a little tired from the trip.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.400
Normally he wouldn't say...

08:52.400 --> 08:55.500
Your attitude is being noted, Mr. Rivers.

09:04.500 --> 09:09.200
If that was your idea of being an
ambassador, we're headed for trouble.

11:54.200 --> 11:57.500
Do you know any good white
basketball players?

11:57.500 --> 12:01.500
There are no good white basketball
players, my friend.

12:01.700 --> 12:04.600
There was trouble on the Berlin Express.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.300
They knew I was on that train.

12:07.300 --> 12:12.300
We suspect there is a traitor
somewhere in the Resistance.

12:12.300 --> 12:16.300
We must proceed nonetheless.
There is too much at stake.

12:16.300 --> 12:22.000
Here, kind sir, smell this flower.
It never fails to amuse at parties.

12:25.300 --> 12:29.200
It's very good.
The German's are planning something.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.500
Time is running out.

12:31.500 --> 12:35.500
Have you found out
where Dr Flammond is being kept?

12:35.700 --> 12:40.100
Here, this is one of our most popular items.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.600
That's very good.

12:45.600 --> 12:49.500
We do not know
where they are keeping Dr Flammond.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.700
Only that they are forcing him
to build a new weapon.

12:52.700 --> 12:55.500
What are my instructions?

12:55.500 --> 13:01.100
Here, try this. This will make you
very popular at social gatherings.

13:05.100 --> 13:09.100
Go tonight to the ballet.
Use this ticket.

13:09.400 --> 13:13.300
You will meet the leader of the Resistance,
a man known as "The Torch".

13:13.300 --> 13:15.800
Until then, wait at the Howard Johnson's

13:15.800 --> 13:18.400
on the corner of Der Fuhrer Strasse
and Goebbels Platzen.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.400
Good luck, kind sir, and God be with you.

13:21.400 --> 13:25.200
Wait. You dropped your phoney dog poo.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.900
What phoney dog poo?

13:27.900 --> 13:31.800

<i>HOTEL GO TO SLEEP</i>
[Yid.]

15:09.900 --> 15:13.300
Good evening. A table for two, please.
The name is Rivers.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.900
Ah, yes. Mr. Rivers.

15:15.900 --> 15:22.300
I have it right here, but we require
a jacket and tie for the dining room.

15:22.300 --> 15:25.800
We will be very happy
to provide you with one.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.900
That'll be fine.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.500
Jurgen.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.100
This way, sir.

15:36.300 --> 15:39.800
General Streck, Comrade Biletnikov.

15:39.800 --> 15:44.200
- I have your table ready for you.
- Very good, Heinz.

15:44.200 --> 15:48.200
As you know, Comrade Biletnikov
holds a very high rank in the party.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.500
We wish to afford him every courtesy.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.100
But of course, mein General.

15:53.100 --> 15:58.600
Perhaps Comrade Biletnikov could be
persuaded to sing for us this evening.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.300
I will take care of it.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.700
Thank you.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.500
Nick, I'm sorry I won't be
able to join you for dinner tonight.

16:16.500 --> 16:20.200
I'm coming down with a sore throat.
So, I've decided to turn in early.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.500
Don't forget to be at the theatre at 8:30.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.800
- This doesn't help at all.
- Don't worry, Martin.

16:27.800 --> 16:31.100
Why don't you get some sleep?
Is there anything you need?

16:31.100 --> 16:34.400
No. I just wanted to make sure
you got those new arrangements.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.100
I got them right here.

16:37.100 --> 16:42.900
By the way, I ordered that '84 Ripple Blanc
for you that they recommended.

16:42.900 --> 16:45.100
- It's very good.
- Thanks.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.800
Who do you favour
in the Virginia Slims Tournament?

17:17.800 --> 17:21.800
In women's tennis,
I always root against the heterosexual.

17:22.099 --> 17:24.200
Have you heard from Cedric?

17:24.200 --> 17:28.000
He was just here. Wait in your hotel
room. He will meet you there.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.200
This letter has to be in New York
by Tuesday.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.900
Now, go! Quickly!

18:08.800 --> 18:14.200
I'm sorry, madam, but this evening
is only for guests of the cultural festival.

18:18.700 --> 18:21.500
Your Ripple Blanc, sir.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.900
Jurgen, escort this lady out.

18:52.100 --> 18:55.600
Excuse me, this lady is with me.

18:55.600 --> 18:59.200
Mr. Rivers,
a thousand pardons, madam.

18:59.200 --> 19:03.200
After you, my dear.
You're just in time.

19:03.500 --> 19:07.400
I don't think I've ever seen you
looking so lovely.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
- That was very kind of you.
- My pleasure.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.800
I was looking for someone to dance with.

19:18.800 --> 19:22.100
- You're an American.
- That's right.

19:22.100 --> 19:25.400
- My uncle was born in America.
- Really?

19:25.400 --> 19:28.400
But he was one of the lucky ones.

19:28.400 --> 19:33.600
He managed to escape in a balloon
during the Jimmy Carter presidency.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.600
- I bet he's got a lot of great stories.
- Yes!

19:36.600 --> 19:41.100
He would tell me about
the large houses and expensive cars.

19:41.100 --> 19:45.700
How young people waste time watching
television and listening to rock and roll.

19:45.700 --> 19:48.600
- What's wrong with television?
- Not all television.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.200
"M*A*S*H" was OK
and the "Mary Tyler Moore Show".

19:51.200 --> 19:55.600
It just seems like young people
of America take freedom for granted.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.800
Wait. I don't think you're being fair.

19:57.800 --> 20:01.400
My history class once spent
an entire week in Philadelphia.

20:01.400 --> 20:06.100
Maybe so. You can talk
about freedom all you want,

20:06.100 --> 20:11.100
but still, you don't know what
it's like to have to fight for it.

20:31.900 --> 20:34.100
Perhaps my lecture was unwarranted.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.700
I am grateful for what you did back there.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.500
You'd really like America.
We've got the Liberty Bell,

20:39.500 --> 20:41.400
Disneyland on both coasts. It's happening.

<i>Go take a s**t in the ocean</i> [Yid]

20:43.800 --> 20:46.600
I'm sorry. I really don't know any German.

20:46.600 --> 20:50.200
That's all right. I know a little German.
He's sitting over there.

20:55.300 --> 20:57.900

21:11.700 --> 21:13.800

21:18.100 --> 21:21.000
- Thank you...
- Hillary.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.900
That's an unusual name.

21:23.900 --> 21:29.300
It's German. It means,
she whose bosoms defy gravity.

21:32.200 --> 21:35.400
Pleased to meet you.
My name's Nick.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.400
Nick, what does that mean?

21:38.400 --> 21:41.600
Nothing. My dad thought of it
while he was shaving.

21:46.700 --> 21:50.400
Are you in some kind of trouble
with the police?

21:50.400 --> 21:53.100
Some things are better left unsaid.

21:54.100 --> 21:55.800
Like what?

21:55.800 --> 22:02.600
Sometimes when you blow your nose
into a tissue and put it in your purse.

22:02.600 --> 22:09.100
Then you reach for your lipstick, your hand
gushes into it, and it goes all over...

22:09.100 --> 22:11.600
You're right.
Some things are better left unsaid.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.600
Thank you very much.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.100
Ladies and gentlemen.

22:21.100 --> 22:26.700
We are fortunate to have with us tonight,
a singer, whose great talent

22:26.700 --> 22:30.700
is exceeded only by his devotion
to his country.

22:31.100 --> 22:34.100
He truly has the gift of song.

22:34.100 --> 22:36.300
A golden voice. Inspired talent and...

22:36.300 --> 22:39.400
Is there something wrong?

22:39.400 --> 22:41.800
I was afraid this might happen.

22:41.800 --> 22:46.800
General Streck of the High Command
is a most fervent admirer,

22:46.800 --> 22:50.300
and owns a complete set of his works.

22:50.300 --> 22:53.800
He is a very shy and gentle man,

22:53.800 --> 22:57.800
but perhaps we could persuade him
to sing for us.

22:58.100 --> 23:00.200
Shall we ask him?

23:04.600 --> 23:08.600
I better do what they want.
I promised my manager.

23:22.900 --> 23:24.800
Thank you, sir.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.600
Watch the change
in the second chorus.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.000
Oh, my God.
240.5
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,000
Wop-bop-a-loom-a-blop-bam-boom 
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy, etc...

26:06.400 --> 26:07.800
Cedric!

26:20.500 --> 26:24.100
- What have they done to you?
- It was a trap!

26:24.100 --> 26:27.900
They must have known
I was staying at the Howard Johnson's.

26:27.900 --> 26:31.100
- But who did this?
- Never mind about that.

26:31.100 --> 26:33.800
We've got to rescue your father
before it's too late.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.200
But what are we going to do?

26:36.200 --> 26:37.400
I was...

26:39.400 --> 26:42.300
...supposed to go to the ballet tonight,

26:42.300 --> 26:45.200
to meet a man called "The Torch".

26:45.200 --> 26:46.900
Thank you.

26:46.900 --> 26:50.700
He's the leader of the Resistance.
He'll help us find your father.

26:50.700 --> 26:54.700
- I'll go.
- No, you can't go. It's too dangerous.

26:54.700 --> 26:57.600
I must! He'll be tortured.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.800
All right, but be very careful at the ballet.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.200
Where is the ticket?

27:03.200 --> 27:05.700
In the glove compartment.

27:05.700 --> 27:07.400
Can you reach it from the inside?

27:10.900 --> 27:13.300
How about the other hand?

27:17.600 --> 27:19.900
No, that's not it. Let me try.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.500
Here it is.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.700
Come on, we've got to get out of here.

29:25.700 --> 29:30.000
- Shouldn't we wait for the police?
- That was the police!

29:36.200 --> 29:38.100
In here.

29:46.800 --> 29:49.100
We can get out this way.

29:49.100 --> 29:53.000
- Wait. First you can explain.
- I'm not sure I can.

29:59.100 --> 30:01.600
I only know I have put you in great danger.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.800
Trust me. You must come with me.

30:03.800 --> 30:07.400
I don't know what trouble you're in,
but don't worry about me.

30:07.400 --> 30:10.400
I'm a guest of the government.
I can explain everything.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.000
But you're mistaken. They'll put you in...

30:14.900 --> 30:18.200
Go while you still can.
They can't do anything to me.

30:43.000 --> 30:49.300
Martin, boy am I glad to see you.
I've been here 20 minutes already.

30:51.900 --> 30:55.400
Nick, I've tried everything.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.800
The Embassy, the German Government,
the consulate.

30:58.800 --> 31:02.800
I even talked to the UN Ambassador.
It's no use.

31:03.100 --> 31:06.200
I just can't bring my wife to orgasm.

31:08.100 --> 31:11.000
That's a shame, Martin.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.200
Have you tried one of these?

31:17.500 --> 31:20.400
Thanks. I'll give it a whirl.

31:21.900 --> 31:27.600
I'm getting worried about this place.
I don't think they've even heard of a trial.

31:27.600 --> 31:31.000
All I know is, after you left the cafe
last night, I met a girl.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.600
Later at the ballet she was alone.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.400
Then I see this guy with a gun at her head.

31:36.400 --> 31:40.400
He's looking like he's gonna kill her
and might have if I hadn't stepped in.

31:40.800 --> 31:45.300
There's got to be someone you can call,
to straighten this mess out.

31:45.300 --> 31:49.300
I figure they've got to let you out
for your concert, Friday night.

31:49.600 --> 31:52.400
They're beaming it live by satellite
to 85 countries.

31:52.400 --> 31:57.000
Just relax and remember,
there's nothing to worry about.

32:02.897 --> 32:06.746
In domini patrum, spiritos
mortrium dios madre.

32:06.747 --> 32:10.416
Ominia, Gallias, Divisa
est en tres partes.

32:10.417 --> 32:13.287
Corpus dilecti. Quid pro quo.

32:13.288 --> 32:17.515
Veni vidi vici. No lo contendre.

32:17.516 --> 32:20.267
Habeas corpus. Rick Dureus.

32:20.268 --> 32:24.136
Ipzo facto. Pro forma pari passu.

32:24.137 --> 32:27.435
Hic hick hoc, huius, huius, huius.

32:27.436 --> 32:29.264
E Pluribus Unum.

32:29.406 --> 32:35.086
Oure-yay oing-gay oo-tay et-gay
ied-fray in the air-chay.

32:35.087 --> 32:38.055
Tempus fugit. Caveat emptor.

32:38.134 --> 32:40.213
Coitus interruptus.

32:40.214 --> 32:42.350
Mitzi Gaynor ad nauseum

32:42.400 --> 32:44.500
Amen.

32:53.100 --> 32:55.700
We wish to impress upon you, Mr. Rivers,

32:55.700 --> 32:59.500
that we have methods of dealing
with those who will not cooperate.

32:59.500 --> 33:03.500
For the last time,
why did you attack Sergeant Kruger?

33:03.900 --> 33:07.500
I didn't know who it was.
I just saw him pull a gun on a girl.

33:07.500 --> 33:13.300
Might I remind you, Mr. Rivers, the penalty
for murder is death by firing squad.

33:13.300 --> 33:17.300
Let us hope for your sake
that Sergeant Kruger survives.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.500
It is the hospital, mein General.

33:24.500 --> 33:28.500
What is the condition of Sergeant Kruger?

33:28.500 --> 33:34.600
I see. Let me know if there
is any change in his condition.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.100
He is dead.

33:41.900 --> 33:45.900
You leave me no alternative,
but to introduce two of my associates.

33:47.300 --> 33:51.300
Bruno is almost blind.
He has to operate wholly by touch.

33:52.800 --> 33:56.800
Klaus is a moron, who knows only what
he reads in "The New York Post".

33:57.100 --> 34:00.300
I believe they never let a man
lose consciousness

34:00.300 --> 34:02.600
however long they may work on him.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.600
You don't scare me.

34:04.600 --> 34:07.700
My manager is on his way
to the American Consulate.

34:07.700 --> 34:10.900
Do not be so sure, Mr. Rivers.

34:10.900 --> 34:13.100
Evidently, your friend did not realise

34:13.100 --> 34:16.900
that here in East Germany
we use 220 volt current.

34:16.900 --> 34:21.400
He was found in his hotel room impaled
on a large electrical device.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.600
Our surgeons did what they could

34:23.600 --> 34:28.400
but it took them two hours
just to get the smile off his face.

34:31.100 --> 34:34.199
Perhaps the American
has chosen to reconsider.

34:45.100 --> 34:48.800
Make sure they leave no marks.

34:51.904 --> 34:55.938
<i>Ich liebe Dich, mein Schatz.</i>
I love you, my darling

35:12.400 --> 35:16.100
Do you know which room
the final chemistry exam is in?

35:16.100 --> 35:19.400
All the exams are over.
Haven't you been to class?

35:19.400 --> 35:22.200
- No.
- But it's the end of the semester.

35:22.200 --> 35:28.300
No, I haven't studied.
Oh no, I'm back in school.

35:28.300 --> 35:31.300
I can't believe I'm back in school.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.300
Thank God.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.000
Well?

35:43.000 --> 35:46.300
They're still working on him.
He won't break.

35:46.300 --> 35:48.800
They've tried everything.

35:48.800 --> 35:51.600
Do you want me to bring out
the LeRoy Neiman paintings?

35:51.600 --> 35:55.600
No. We cannot risk violating
the Geneva Convention.

35:55.900 --> 35:58.100
We'll break him tomorrow.

37:17.300 --> 37:20.100
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

37:20.100 --> 37:23.900
My name is Nick Rivers.
Who are you?

37:23.900 --> 37:29.900
I am Dr Paul Flammond.
I am a prisoner here, just like you.

37:29.900 --> 37:33.500
A year ago, I was close to perfecting

37:33.500 --> 37:37.000
the first magnetic desalinisation process.

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
So revolutionary,
it was capable of removing the salt

37:41.100 --> 37:44.800
from over 500 million gallons
of sea water a day.

37:44.800 --> 37:48.800
Do you realise what that could mean
to the starving nations of the earth?

37:51.100 --> 37:53.700
They'd have enough salt to last forever.

37:54.900 --> 37:57.800
But then one night,
the Secret Police broke into my house.

37:57.800 --> 38:01.200
They tore me from my family,
ransacked my laboratory

38:01.200 --> 38:04.000
and brought me to this dungeon.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.700
That sucks!

38:05.700 --> 38:08.600
For the first time in my life,

38:08.600 --> 38:13.100
- I am ashamed of being a scientist.
- What do you mean?

38:13.100 --> 38:17.100
They are forcing me to create
a horrible weapon.

38:17.200 --> 38:20.700
- Can't you refuse?
- I wish I could.

38:20.700 --> 38:23.700
But they are holding my daughter.

38:23.700 --> 38:28.200
They'll kill her unless I complete
the Polaris Mine by Sunday.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.700
Sunday? That's Simchas Torah.

38:31.700 --> 38:34.800
And the day the entire NATO
submarine fleet

38:34.800 --> 38:37.300
passes through the Straits of Gibraltar.

38:37.300 --> 38:39.600
Is this the Polaris mine?

38:39.600 --> 38:44.600
Yes. By Sunday I will be able to arm it
with a nuclear warhead.

38:44.600 --> 38:48.100
- How does it work?
- It is a magnetic mine

38:48.100 --> 38:52.700
so powerful it will attract itself
to submarines miles away.

38:52.700 --> 38:56.400
- How about that?
- Oh, no.

39:03.500 --> 39:07.500
Go quickly. If they find out
you've seen this, your life will be worth less

39:07.600 --> 39:10.800
than a truck load of dead rats
in a tampon factory.

39:20.300 --> 39:22.000
Right away.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.900
- Von Horst!
- Ja, mein General.

39:24.900 --> 39:28.000
The government wishes to avoid
an international incident.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.800
Mr. Rivers must perform
his concert tonight.

39:30.800 --> 39:33.700
He is to be executed this very minute.

39:33.700 --> 39:37.700
- It'll have to wait. Call them at once.
- Ja, mein General.

40:04.827 --> 40:08.103
<i>How silly can you get? Yeah, yeah</i>

40:08.104 --> 40:11.469
<i>How silly can you get? Ooh, yeah</i>

40:11.470 --> 40:14.960
<i>I never ever meant to stray,
but when she looked at me that way</i>

40:14.961 --> 40:18.409
<i>The night was young and
gay Paris made me forget</i>

40:18.410 --> 40:21.852
<i>I went to Paris in France
I found a little romance</i>

40:21.853 --> 40:25.156
<i>She was a-walkin' down the boulevard</i>

40:25.157 --> 40:28.711
<i>I know I should've been good
I never thought that I would</i>

40:28.712 --> 40:32.074
<i>Be double-crossin', baby
cross my heart</i>

40:33.453 --> 40:39.847
<i>Oh, a little rockin' and a little wine
Got me thinkin' 'bout a little Valentine</i>

40:39.848 --> 40:45.202
<i>What's a lonely boy to do
She looked so fine</i>

40:45.831 --> 40:49.120
<i>How silly can you get? Yeah, yeah</i>

40:49.121 --> 40:52.524
<i>How silly can you get? Ooh, yeah</i>

40:52.525 --> 40:55.847
<i>I never ever meant to stray
But when she looked at me that way</i>

40:55.848 --> 40:59.261
<i>The night was young and
gay Paris made me forget</i>

40:59.262 --> 41:06.156
<i>How silly can you get? Yeah, yeah
How silly can you get? Ooh, yeah</i>

41:06.157 --> 41:13.114
<i>No more fooling around you bet
How silly can you get?</i>

41:14.236 --> 41:26.495
<i>I can't believe it's true
That I just met a girl like you</i>

41:30.745 --> 41:35.848
<i>Each night I'm all alone
My heart's an empty home</i>

41:35.849 --> 41:41.574
<i>To see you standing there
Would be my only prayer</i>

41:41.575 --> 41:47.110
<i>You set my heart on fire
It's burning with desire</i>

41:47.111 --> 41:49.704
<i>Your touch, your lips, your soul</i>

41:49.705 --> 41:55.895
<i>You make me lose control
Baby please, (baby please, baby please)</i>

41:55.896 --> 42:00.134
<i>Spend this night with me</i>

42:01.559 --> 42:06.280
<i>I can't believe it's true</i>

42:06.281 --> 42:11.562
<i>I met a girl like you</i>

42:11.563 --> 42:18.004
<i>In heaven we would be</i>

42:18.005 --> 42:23.767
<i>If you would spend this night with me</i>

42:23.768 --> 42:29.492
<i>Darling, I'm here to say
I pray there'll come a day</i>

42:29.493 --> 42:34.790
<i>When by my side you'll stay
And you, you will always be</i>

42:34.791 --> 42:37.279
<i>A love that's true to me</i>

42:37.280 --> 42:42.725
<i>You set my heart on fire
It's burning with desire</i>

42:42.726 --> 42:45.498
<i>Your touch, your lips, your soul</i>

42:45.499 --> 42:51.600
<i>You make me lose control
Baby please (baby please, baby please)</i>

42:51.601 --> 42:56.973
<i>Spend this night with me</i>

42:56.974 --> 43:00.060
<i>Oh baby, baby please</i>

43:00.061 --> 43:02.502
<i>Don't you understand I need you?</i>

43:02.503 --> 43:04.844
<i>I can't live without you</i>

43:04.845 --> 43:08.333
<i>I'm gonna say something
I never said before</i>

43:08.809 --> 43:10.574
<i>I even love you</i>

43:10.575 --> 43:13.141
<i>Ah, it's just no use</i>

43:13.142 --> 43:17.473
<i>I'm beggin' you, darling. I can't
face another day without you</i>

43:17.474 --> 43:21.190
<i>Oh honey lamb I'm... I'm afraid... I...</i>

43:21.191 --> 43:25.337
<i>Don't you understand? I'm
losin', I'm losin' my very mind</i>

43:25.338 --> 43:27.171
<i>I gotta have you with me</i>

43:27.172 --> 43:30.226
<i>I'm in such a complete
anguish without you</i>

43:30.227 --> 43:33.567
<i>Oh... oh... Sugar drawers... I...</i>

43:33.568 --> 43:37.513
<i>Baby, I'm standing at
the great abyss of love</i>

43:37.514 --> 43:39.061
<i>And... nd I'm teeterin'</i>

43:39.062 --> 43:42.951
<i>Oh, dumpling, I promise I'll
even be nice to your mama</i>

43:42.952 --> 43:52.054
<i>Baby please, spend this night with me</i>

43:52.940 --> 43:57.342
<i>Ooh wah</i>

44:15.000 --> 44:16.800
Those bikes!

44:30.200 --> 44:33.100
That is no excuse!
Search the road again!

44:43.800 --> 44:46.100
They're in the Eastern sector.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.400
I want the whole area sealed off!

45:06.000 --> 45:08.600
There's a used book store
somewhere around here.

45:08.600 --> 45:10.400
The owner is a member of the Resistance.

45:10.400 --> 45:15.100
- If we can find him...
- Resistance? Wait a minute.

45:15.100 --> 45:19.700
Don't you think it's about time
you told what this is all about?

45:19.700 --> 45:23.000
I'm sorry, I guess I do owe
you an explanation.

45:23.000 --> 45:28.100
Only a year ago I was teaching
a course in black history

45:28.100 --> 45:31.100
at the University of Blaupunkt.

45:31.100 --> 45:36.600
One night, I came home to find my father
had been arrested by the Secret Police.

45:36.600 --> 45:39.900
I've been trying to find him ever since.

45:40.600 --> 45:43.800
Wait a minute. That's Dr Flammond.

45:43.800 --> 45:46.600
I saw him yesterday in Flurgendorf Prison.

45:46.600 --> 45:49.100
Flurgendorf Prison? Is he all right?

45:49.100 --> 45:51.700
- He looks fine.
- Thank God, he's safe.

45:51.700 --> 45:54.900
We must get this information
to the Resistance.

45:54.900 --> 45:58.400
- Maybe they can help us.
- Let's go.

46:38.200 --> 46:43.000
There it is.
It's a Swedish book store.

48:21.500 --> 48:28.300
That's OK. Don't feel bad.
It happens to lots of men the first time.

48:28.300 --> 48:30.500
Just relax. I'll pour you a drink.

48:30.500 --> 48:33.600
We can always try again
in a couple of hours,

48:33.600 --> 48:38.100
she said, as she laid down beside him
and caressed his chest.

48:38.100 --> 48:40.900
Can you believe they print this trash?

48:40.900 --> 48:44.500
Don't worry about it. You were going
to tell me something about your childhood.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.500
When I was a young girl,

48:49.500 --> 48:52.200
my uncle took me on a tropical cruise.

48:52.200 --> 48:54.300
But there was a terrible storm

48:54.300 --> 48:56.800
and the boat sank.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.400
I managed to swim to a deserted island

48:59.400 --> 49:01.900
with a young boy, named Nigel.

49:01.900 --> 49:04.400
Together we had to learn to survive.

49:07.400 --> 49:10.100
Fortunately the ocean provided its bounty,

49:10.100 --> 49:13.100
which Nigel would catch every day.

49:13.100 --> 49:16.300
Later, I would forage inland
for fruit and vegetables

49:16.300 --> 49:21.100
from the endless varieties
of trees and bushes all over the island.

49:21.100 --> 49:25.000
We busied ourselves chopping palm
fronds and lacing them to bamboo

49:25.000 --> 49:27.600
with dried seaweed and snot.

49:27.600 --> 49:30.900
This not only provided us
with a safe haven from the rain.

49:30.900 --> 49:33.900
but sheltered us
from the relentless Santa Ana winds

49:33.900 --> 49:36.900
which would periodically
ravage the island.

49:36.900 --> 49:39.700
The years passed and as we grew up,

49:39.700 --> 49:44.400
we began to notice
strange new feelings awakening in us.

49:44.400 --> 49:47.000
There was no one around to explain this.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.800
We had to learn by ourselves.

50:19.400 --> 50:22.200
Then one day he went fishing.

50:22.200 --> 50:25.800
That was the last I ever saw of Nigel.

50:25.800 --> 50:29.000
I spent months by myself on that island,

50:29.000 --> 50:32.600
until I was finally rescued
by a passing ship.

50:32.600 --> 50:35.300
I'll never forget my feeling of relief.

50:35.300 --> 50:37.600
You can't imagine what it's like

50:37.600 --> 50:39.800
to be separated from your family

50:39.800 --> 50:42.000
at such a young age.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.700
I think I can.

50:47.400 --> 50:52.200
When I was about six years old,
my momma took me to the city.

50:52.200 --> 50:56.900
We went to one of those big old
department stores, and I got lost.

50:56.900 --> 50:59.500
They tried to page her,

50:59.500 --> 51:02.600
but the PA system was on the fritz.

51:03.700 --> 51:06.800
I never saw my momma again.

51:06.800 --> 51:09.700
Some people
from the cosmetics department

51:09.700 --> 51:12.100
fed me a bowl of soup and some bread.

51:12.100 --> 51:14.300
Days stretched into weeks.

51:14.300 --> 51:16.600
One February they got jammed up

51:16.600 --> 51:19.400
during the semi-annual
Lincoln's birthday sale.

51:19.400 --> 51:21.900
They asked me to help out
in Pre-Teen Maternity.

51:24.300 --> 51:27.000
Then one day I overheard
a conversation in personnel

51:27.000 --> 51:30.200
about them needing a new jingle
for their radio ad.

51:30.200 --> 51:33.900
So I picked up my guitar
and I wrote down a tune

51:33.900 --> 51:37.900
that had been mulling and creeping
and crawling around in my head.

51:38.200 --> 51:40.700
It went something like this.

51:50.837 --> 51:55.022
<i>Are you lonesome tonight</i>

51:55.023 --> 51:59.063
<i>Is your kitchen a sight</i>

51:59.064 --> 52:07.251
<i>Is your wardrobe all rundown and bare</i>

52:07.252 --> 52:12.045
<i>Is your lipstick all smeared</i>

52:12.046 --> 52:15.810
<i>Are your stockings not sheer</i>

52:15.811 --> 52:23.334
<i>Do they make your legs
show all your hair</i>

52:23.335 --> 52:32.271
<i>Do the tears on your
pillow roll down as you turn</i>

52:32.272 --> 52:40.178
<i>Do they short out the blanket
and make the sheets burn</i>

52:40.179 --> 52:48.233
<i>Is your heart filled with pain,
will you come back again</i>

52:48.234 --> 52:54.551
<i>Shop at Macy's and love me tonight</i>

52:54.900 --> 52:56.600
Oh, Nick.
523.1
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,900
You are in my heart,
<i>Du, Du liegst mir im Herzen,
523.2
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,900
you are in my mind.
<i>Du, Du, liegst mir im Sinn.
523.3
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,400
You give me a lot of pain,
<i>Du, Du machst mir viel Schmerzen,
523.4
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,900
you don't know how good I am to you.
<i>weisst nicht wie gut ich Dir bin.
523.5
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,900
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
<i>Ja, ja, ja, ja,
523.6
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,900
you don't know how good I am to you.
<i>weisst nicht wie gut ich Dir bin.</i></i></i></i></i></i>

53:41.400 --> 53:43.900
All right, this is it.

53:43.900 --> 53:46.000
I must leave you here.

53:47.400 --> 53:49.700
Go now, quickly.

53:52.500 --> 53:55.900
- Is he all right?
- He caught a cold the other day.

53:55.900 --> 53:58.100
He's just a little hoarse.

53:58.100 --> 54:00.200
Giddy-up, Mario.

54:12.400 --> 54:15.300
- Yes?
- Is this the potato farm?

54:15.300 --> 54:19.700
Yes, I am Albert Potato. Who are you?

54:19.700 --> 54:22.800
We were sent by Sven Jorgensen.

54:26.900 --> 54:28.700
Come this way.

54:55.100 --> 54:59.100
- What do you want?
- We wanna see "The Torch".

54:59.400 --> 55:02.500
No one is allowed to see "The Torch".

55:02.500 --> 55:08.300
But we have important information about
my father, Dr Paul Flammond.

55:08.300 --> 55:10.900
We shall see.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.900
- Nigel!
- Hillary!

55:33.700 --> 55:37.600
It is you. My darling, Hillary.

55:37.600 --> 55:40.600
If only you knew how I've yearned
for this day to come.

55:40.600 --> 55:45.400
Sleepless nights, lonely hours,
hoping, praying that once more

55:45.400 --> 55:48.900
I would gaze
into your ravishing brown eyes.

55:48.900 --> 55:52.700
Who is this I should thank
for bringing you back to me?

55:52.700 --> 55:55.900
This is Nick.
Nick Rivers, he's a friend.

55:55.900 --> 55:59.900
Forgive us, Mr. Rivers,
if we have been less than hospitable.

56:00.200 --> 56:06.100
Recently we've had reason to believe
there is a traitor in the Resistance.

56:06.100 --> 56:10.000
Du Quois,
introduce the American to the men.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.700
Very well.

56:12.500 --> 56:18.900
This is Chevalier, Montage, Detente,

56:18.900 --> 56:23.400
Avant Garde, and Deja Vu.

56:24.300 --> 56:26.900
Have we not met before, Monsieur?

56:27.900 --> 56:29.700
I don't think so.

56:34.400 --> 56:36.100
Over there...

56:36.100 --> 56:41.200
Croissant, Souffle, Escargot,

56:41.200 --> 56:43.600
and Chocolate Mousse.

56:49.700 --> 56:53.300
Now, Mr. Rivers,
what is the news that you bring us?

56:53.300 --> 56:56.500
I've seen Dr Flammond
in Flurgendorf prison.

56:56.500 --> 57:00.200
He told me the Polaris mine
will be ready on Sunday.

57:01.400 --> 57:02.600
Sacrebleu.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.400
We'll have to move out tonight.

57:06.400 --> 57:08.600
I'll be back in a moment, my darling.

57:08.600 --> 57:10.900
Prepare the gear for the jump.

57:10.900 --> 57:12.900
Cordon bleu. Zut!

57:12.900 --> 57:15.900
- I want to explain.
- What's to explain?

57:15.900 --> 57:19.500
I'm not the first guy who fell in love
with a girl he met in a restaurant,

57:19.500 --> 57:22.700
who turned out to be the daughter
of a kidnapped scientist,

57:22.700 --> 57:26.200
to lose her to her childhood lover
she'd last seen on a deserted island

57:26.200 --> 57:29.800
who, 15 years later, is the leader
of the French underground.

57:29.800 --> 57:33.100
It all sounds like some bad movie.

57:40.000 --> 57:45.500
Forget it. It'll be better for everyone
if we just forget what's happened.

57:45.500 --> 57:49.500
We've arranged for your safe
transportation across the border tonight.

57:49.900 --> 57:53.300
It's the least we can do
to show our gratitude.

57:53.300 --> 57:58.700
Come, my darling, let me show you
what I've done to the fallout shelter.

58:21.300 --> 58:23.800
Do not take it so hard, Nick.

58:23.800 --> 58:27.200
Life is filled with its little miseries.

58:27.200 --> 58:31.200
Each of us, in his own way,
must learn to deal with adversity

58:31.400 --> 58:34.200
in a mature and adult fashion.

58:45.400 --> 58:48.800
- Mind if I have a swig of this?
- Go right ahead.

58:48.800 --> 58:52.300
- What the hell is this stuff?
- Gasoline.

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
Don't worry, my darling.
I'm sure your friend will get over it.

59:01.100 --> 59:03.800
He seems a good chap, really.

59:03.800 --> 59:06.400
How wonderful you've returned to me,

59:06.400 --> 59:10.100
when I desperately need you
by my side, to fight for the cause...

59:10.100 --> 59:13.900
- Our cause.
- Oh, Nigel, I am proud of you.

59:13.900 --> 59:18.600
But I'm so confused.
All these years I thought you were dead.

59:18.600 --> 59:21.200
And by all rights I should be.

59:21.200 --> 59:23.900
I floated at sea for days,
nearly unconscious.

59:23.900 --> 59:27.200
Then as luck would have it,
I was picked up by a passing freighter.

59:27.200 --> 59:30.200
I tried to get them to save you too.

59:30.200 --> 59:33.100
It was a foreign ship
and they didn't understand English.

59:33.100 --> 59:38.400
I yelled and screamed, but it only
seemed to excite them all the more.

59:38.400 --> 59:41.700
They took advantage of me
in ways I cannot describe.

59:41.700 --> 59:47.400
Oh, Nigel, it must have been awful.

59:53.300 --> 59:55.200
Latrine!

59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.400
- What did you find out, Latrine?
- Where are the others?

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.400
We never had a chance.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.400
It was a slaughter.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.600
We must put a stop
to these afternoon football games.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.900
- Which direction did they come from?
- Up the road.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:18.000
- Take cover!
- They're gonna kill us all.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.300
Take this.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.400
Grenade.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.100
We're running out of time.
The plane will not wait for us.

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:58.300
We'll have to make a break for it.

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:01.000
Rendezvous at the cafe
near the landing field.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.100
Wait!

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.200
Nice shooting.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.300
My man!

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.700
Good. Now everybody's accounted for.

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:54.100
Here's the plan.
We'll be taking off at 1 :00 am.

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:56.100
What about the American?

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:59.000
A truck will be here
at exactly midnight.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.100
He'll jump on the back
and be driven on to the border.

01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:06.000
Wait. Nick is the only one
who knows the inside of that prison.

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:13.900
Well, Monsieur Rivers,
it seems that you have become,

01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:16.800
how do you say, indispensable?

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.600
Indispensable.

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.300
That's what I thought.

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:26.300
Sorry, fellas. I've done my time
in Flurgendorf prison.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.800
I got a truck to meet.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.800
Nick, ask any price you want,
but you must help us.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.800
Seems as long as I know my way
around that prison, I'll never be lonely.

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.300
I know how you feel about me.

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:45.600
But put your feelings aside
for something more important.

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.200
Like what a great cause
you and Nigel are fighting for?

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.500
- But this was your cause too.
- My only cause is my music.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.700
That's exactly what I mean.

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:59.900
Didn't you see the eyes of those kids
at your concert? You must help us.

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:02.300
If not for me, for the cause of freedom.

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.300
Latrine.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.600
- A traitor in our midst.
- Well done, Latrine.

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.800
I see you have dealt with him
appropriately.

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.800
Not the bird, you fool!

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.800
This is a carrier pigeon on its way
to German headquarters.

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:23.600
Look, a message.

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:29.400
Resistance planning to free Flammond,
Sunday, 8:00 am.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:34.000
That means the traitor
is someone at this very table.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:45.100
Excuse me, aren't you Nick Rivers,
the American rock and roll star?

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:48.900
No, I'm not.

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:52.200
But you must be.
Won't you sing us one song?

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.200
I'm sorry. You must have me confused
with somebody else.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.600
I'm Mel Torme.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.400
That was close.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:09.400
- Perhaps a bit too close.
- What do you mean?

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:13.400
We have no proof
that this man is who he claims to be.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:17.500
Yet we're asking him to lead us into
Germany's most heavily guarded prison.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:21.500
- That's absurd!
- Just a moment, my darling.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.900
He came to us with no credentials.

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:27.900
The Germans never knew the location
of our headquarters, until he arrived.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:30.800
And we've been
infiltrated by a traitor.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.600
Nigel, what are you saying?

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:38.300
How do we know
he's not Mel Torme?

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.700
Look, he's at the jukebox.

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.600
This is not Mel Torme.

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.399
Oh, Nick.

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:34.500
Yes?

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:38.300
We don't know
what's going to happen down there.

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:43.000
This may be the last time I'll see you.
There's something I wanted to say.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.899
- You don't have to say anything.
- But I want to.

01:08:45.899 --> 01:08:48.200
You must know that when we were
together last night,

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.000
I had no idea that Nigel
was still alive.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.300
And now that you know?

01:08:54.899 --> 01:08:58.399
Oh, Nick, his work is so important to him.

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:03.800
I must stay with him.
He pleaded with me not to leave.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:08.300
I just hope you realise
that's all he means to me.

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:11.899
Oh, I don't know what's right any longer.

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:19.300
I only wish I didn't love you so much.

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.200
I've spotted the herd.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.800
They're the key to the whole plan.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.600
Now, we're here.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.700
Every morning at 7:15

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:21.200
the prison guards bring the cows
from here, up this road

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.100
towards the prison
for their morning milking.

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:28.000
Du Quois and I will merge
with the herd here.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.200
And sneak in through the gate
in the electrified fence.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.800
Then we'll break away from the other cows

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.200
and enter the generator building here.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:43.000
At exactly 7:25 we cut the power.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
The rest of you come through here,
scale this wall,

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:49.900
and Nick can lead you to Flammond's cell.

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:53.400
Meanwhile, Hillary will steal this truck
by the railway crossing

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.700
and pick us up back here.
Then we drive to the landing field

01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:59.400
where the plane will be waiting for us.
Let's go.

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.900
No, you take the head.
I'm taking the back.

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.100
- But the plan was...
- Forget it.

01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:21.900
I give the orders.
Shut up and give me the back half.

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:25.100
All right, be an asshole.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
- Here they come.
- OK, let's move out.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.000
All right, let's go. Double time.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:00.200
We only have five minutes to get
to the circuit box and throw the switch.

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.600
We've got to hurry.
Can you see the gate?

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:07.300
- Yes, it's just ahead.
- Where are the guards?

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:10.200
I can only see one.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.700
There girl, move along.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:23.100
Stay behind the guards.

01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:26.800
Once we're round the corner
we'll break away from the herd.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.800
OK, now!

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.400
I think we did it.

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:40.800
- Can you see the generator?
- It's behind the feed bin.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.500
All right, let's go. We've got to hurry.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.400
Mon Dieu!

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.100
Nigel, you OK?

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:57.000
Oh, yeah.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Let's go.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.900
What's the hurry? Why are you always
in such a bloody rush?

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:07.100
I just wanted to take a...rest.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:29.300
- The guards have passed.
- How long till they cut the power?

01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:32.100
Three more minutes.

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.400
Then we can cut the wire.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.100
There it is.

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:51.500
Lovely.

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:09.400
You're all right now. I'm here.

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.200
It's all right.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.100
Hey.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.500
Here, here.

01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:49.900
Vive la France!

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:07.200
- Nigel, what are you doing?
- Never you mind.

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.800
Why do you want to go back
to the meter shed?

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:13.800
- We're turning the power back on.
- But that will set off the alarms.

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:16.800
- The others will be trapped. I refuse!
- Oh?

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:22.000
This gun says you won't.
Now, move.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.900
So, it is you who is the traitor!

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:46.800
Don't take it too badly.
You're no more a fool than the others.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.700
Now, get over there and...

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:01.300
- We're taking you out of here.
- But my daughter.

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:03.900
Don't worry. Hillary's with us.

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:06.700
Thank God, but how ironic.

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:10.700
Another day and I would have
completed my tunnel.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.300
Nice work.

01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:44.600
Nigel.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.800
Very clever, my darling.

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.600
You've put the pieces together
very nicely,

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:53.300
but unfortunately it's too late
for you and the others.

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:57.300
- But how could you?
- It wasn't difficult.

01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:00.600
I could have returned to rescue you
from that wretched island,

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.900
but it would have meant leaving
my new found comrades.

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:05.900
Comrades?

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:10.100
Yes, it was a Russian ship.

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:13.600
They taught me all about you...
Imperialist swine.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:17.600
I was exposed to the works
of great thinkers. Karl Marx, Lenin,

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:20.100
L Ron Hubbard, Freddie Laker.

01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:23.900
Now get in the truck.
We're going for a ride.
743.1
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,500
They are already gone,
<i>Sind schon weg,
743.2
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,600
you stupid a**hole!
<i>Du dummes Arschloch!</i></i>

01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:51.000
Something's wrong. Where's the truck?

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
- Where's Hillary?
- I'm hungry.

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.800
What happened?

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.800
Nigel made me go back to the meter shed.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:10.600
He ordered me to set off the alarm.

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:15.100
And what does he want us to do now?

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:17.800
Nothing, you numbskull, Nigel's the traitor.

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:47.900
Latrine!

01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:54.100
Nigel took Hillary in the truck. That way.

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:57.300
I cannot leave the country
without my daughter.

01:19:57.300 --> 01:20:01.000
I'm going after them.
I'll meet you at the landing field.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.300
Nick, whether you make it back or not,

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:07.100
that plane must take off
with Dr Flammond at 18:00 hrs.

01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:10.600
But we recommend you be there
at least 45 minutes before departure,

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:13.000
especially at this time of year.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.900
- Good luck, Nick.
- Let's go.

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:17.500
Good luck.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:30.400
You've go to hand it to the Germans,
they make great cars.

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.200
Goodbye.

01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:34.900
There's no more time.
We've got to take off now.

01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:37.200
I will not leave without my daughter.

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:40.200
Listen, old chap,
in a few minutes it'll be dawn

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.900
and we'll be sitting ducks
to their anti-aircraft guns.

01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:46.000
There they are!

01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:54.000
Oh, Father. Thank God, you're safe.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.100
How I feared I would never see you again.

01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:59.600
I am so proud of you, my beloved.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.400
There'll be time to talk on the plane.
You'd better hurry.

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:06.700
- But I can't go on that plane.
- But Hillary!

01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:11.500
I'm needed here. For as long
as a single man is forced to cower

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.700
under the iron fist of oppression,

01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:15.900
as long as a child cries out in the night,

01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:20.400
or an actor can be elected president,
we must continue the struggle.

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:21.900
No, Hillary.

01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:25.000
It is too dangerous for you
in Germany, now.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.200
Yes, go with Nick. Don't worry about us.

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:31.000
We will hear his music
on the "Voice of America".

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.000
We will hear it in the hearts of people,
and in elevators everywhere.

01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:39.300
And as long as we do,
we know we are not alone in our fight.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:43.300
They're right, Hillary.
And when we get to America...

01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:46.800
- Who knows what will be then.
- Everything will be fine.

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:52.700
Things change, people change,
hairstyles change...

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:54.800
I want you to be with me.

01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:58.800
Interest rates fluctuate. Who knows?

01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:02.900
Don't you want to come with me?
If you don't, say it now.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:08.500
Want!
Want more than anything!

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:11.500
Take me. Take me with you!

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:29.200
Goodbye, Chocolate Mousse.
I'll never forget you.

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:33.000
Goodbye, Du Quois.
Take care of yourself.

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:38.400
Goodbye, Deja Vu.
I will always remember you.

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:42.400
And I'll miss you, most of all, Scarecrow.
