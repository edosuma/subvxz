01:40.727 --> 01:42.497
There was me.

01:42.897 --> 01:45.627
That is, Alex,
and my three droogs.

01:45.907 --> 01:49.536
That is, Pete, Georgie and Dim.

01:49.976 --> 01:53.496
And we sat in the Korova Milk Bar,
trying to make up our rassoodocks...

01:53.746 --> 01:56.006
what to do with the evening.

01:57.716 --> 02:00.806
The Korova Milk Bar sold milk plus.

02:01.056 --> 02:04.715
Milk plus vellocet or
synthemesc or drencrom...

02:04.925 --> 02:06.915
which is what we were drinking.

02:07.495 --> 02:08.884
This would sharpen you up

02:09.095 --> 02:13.055
and make you ready for a bit
of the old ultra-violence.

02:17.395 --> 02:20.894
In Dublin's fair city

02:21.574 --> 02:25.704
Where the girls are so pretty

02:26.774 --> 02:29.834
I first set my eyes

02:30.914 --> 02:34.503
On sweet Molly Malone

02:35.613 --> 02:40.283
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow

02:40.553 --> 02:44.923
Through streets broad and narrow

02:45.223 --> 02:49.633
Crying, "Cockles and mussels"

02:50.592 --> 02:52.692
One thing I could never stand

02:52.902 --> 02:55.302
was to see a filthy,
dirty old drunkie

02:55.572 --> 02:58.232
howling away at the
filthy songs of his fathers

02:58.542 --> 03:00.802
and going "blerp blerp"
in between

03:01.042 --> 03:05.301
as it might be a filthy old
orchestra in his stinking guts.

03:05.581 --> 03:09.211
I could never stand to see anyone
like that, whatever his age.

03:09.411 --> 03:12.581
But more especially when he
was real old, like this one was.

03:20.221 --> 03:24.250
Can you spare some cutter,
me brothers?

03:27.430 --> 03:32.490
Go on! Do me in, you bastard cowards!
I don't want to live anyway.

03:32.770 --> 03:35.600
Not in a stinking world
like this.

03:38.339 --> 03:41.509
And what's so stinking about it?

03:41.749 --> 03:46.009
It's a stinking world because
there's no law and order anymore!

03:46.279 --> 03:49.339
It stinks because it lets
the young get onto the old

03:49.619 --> 03:51.648
like you done!

03:51.958 --> 03:56.758
It's no world
for an old man any longer.

03:57.328 --> 04:00.758
What kind of a world is it
at all?

04:00.998 --> 04:02.858
Men on the moon.

04:03.168 --> 04:05.658
Men spinning around the earth.

04:05.868 --> 04:08.927
And there's not no
attention paid

04:09.137 --> 04:12.697
to earthly
law and order no more.

04:13.037 --> 04:15.637
Oh, dear land

04:16.047 --> 04:18.337
I fought for thee

04:53.644 --> 04:57.374
It was at the derelict casino
that we came across Billy-boy

04:57.654 --> 04:59.674
and his four droogs.

05:00.014 --> 05:02.414
They were about to perform
a little of the old

05:02.724 --> 05:06.654
in-out, in-out on a weepy
young devotchka they had there.

05:56.770 --> 05:59.640
Well, if it isn't fat, stinking

05:59.940 --> 06:04.210
billy goat
Billy-boy in poison.

06:05.050 --> 06:06.640
How are thou

06:06.910 --> 06:10.749
thou globby bottle of cheap,
stinking chip-oil?

06:12.449 --> 06:15.049
Come and get one in the yarbles

06:15.289 --> 06:17.149
if you have any yarbles

06:17.419 --> 06:20.419
you eunuch jelly, thou.

06:23.899 --> 06:25.558
Let's get them, boys!

07:23.655 --> 07:25.015
The police!

07:25.655 --> 07:27.284
Come on. Let's go!

07:48.213 --> 07:52.803
The Durango 95 purred away
real horror show.

07:53.013 --> 07:57.242
A nice, warm vibratey feeling
all through your guttiwuts.

07:57.512 --> 08:00.682
Soon it was trees and dark,
my brothers

08:00.922 --> 08:03.482
with real country dark.

08:40.360 --> 08:43.519
We fillied around with other
travelers of the night

08:43.759 --> 08:46.129
playing Hogs of the Road.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.349
Then we headed west.

08:48.599 --> 08:52.299
What we were after now
was the old surprise visit.

08:52.539 --> 08:53.759
That was a real kick

08:54.039 --> 08:58.468
and good for laughs and
lashing of the old ultra-violent.

09:46.915 --> 09:48.915
Who on earth could that be?

09:57.995 --> 09:59.584
I'll go and see.

10:10.374 --> 10:12.004
Yes, who is it?

10:12.274 --> 10:16.273
Excuse me, can you please help?
There's been a terrible accident!

10:17.343 --> 10:21.613
My friend's bleeding to death!
Can I please use your telephone?

10:21.853 --> 10:25.153
We don't have a telephone.
You'll have to go somewhere else.

10:25.353 --> 10:28.053
But, missus, it's a matter
of life and death!

10:28.323 --> 10:29.623
Who is it, dear?

10:29.863 --> 10:32.452
A young man.
He says there's been an accident.

10:32.662 --> 10:35.322
He wants to use the telephone.

10:36.362 --> 10:38.802
I suppose you better let him in.

10:39.832 --> 10:41.702
Wait a minute, will you?

10:43.872 --> 10:47.141
I'm sorry, but we don't usually
let strangers in

10:59.221 --> 11:01.080
What do you want from me?

11:04.830 --> 11:07.660
Pete, check the rest
of the house. Dim

11:12.500 --> 11:14.730
I'm singing in the rain

11:15.770 --> 11:17.699
Just singing in the rain

11:18.539 --> 11:20.369
What a glorious feeling

11:21.239 --> 11:22.729
I'm happy again

11:24.109 --> 11:25.939
I'm laughing at clouds

11:27.079 --> 11:28.449
So dark up above

11:29.879 --> 11:31.439
The sun's in my heart

11:32.918 --> 11:34.718
And I'm ready for love

11:36.358 --> 11:38.588
Let the stormy clouds chase

11:39.458 --> 11:41.388
Everyone from the place

11:43.758 --> 11:45.058
Come on with the rain

11:46.028 --> 11:48.127
I've a smile on my face

11:49.137 --> 11:51.197
I'll walk down the lane

11:52.207 --> 11:54.137
With a happy refrain

11:55.237 --> 11:57.107
And I'm singing

11:57.777 --> 11:59.207
Just singing

12:01.377 --> 12:02.536
in the rain

13:09.312 --> 13:10.772
Viddy well, little brother.

13:11.012 --> 13:12.672
Viddy well.

13:33.031 --> 13:36.860
We were all feeling a bit
shagged and fagged and fashed

13:37.130 --> 13:41.700
it having been an evening
of some small energy expenditure.

13:41.970 --> 13:46.910
So we got rid of the auto and
stopped at the Korova for a nightcap.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.739
Hello, Lucy.

13:55.849 --> 13:57.549
Had a busy night?

13:59.259 --> 14:01.659
We've been working hard too.

14:04.059 --> 14:05.888
Pardon me, Luce.

14:13.538 --> 14:17.058
There was some sophistos from
the TV studios around the corner

14:17.338 --> 14:19.538
laughing and govoreeting.

14:19.878 --> 14:24.937
The devotchka smeched away, not
caring about the wicked world one bit.

14:25.847 --> 14:29.177
Then the disk on the stereo
twanged off and out.

14:29.417 --> 14:32.717
And in the short silence
before the next one came on

14:32.957 --> 14:36.116
she suddenly came
with a burst of singing.

14:39.956 --> 14:42.296
And it was like, for a moment,
O my brothers

14:42.596 --> 14:45.856
some great bird
had flown into the milk bar.

14:46.066 --> 14:49.296
And I felt all the malenky
little hairs on my plott

14:49.566 --> 14:51.435
standing endwise.

14:51.875 --> 14:55.935
And the shivers crawling up
like slow, malenky lizards

14:56.205 --> 14:57.765
and then down again.

14:58.045 --> 15:00.735
Because I knew what she sang.

15:00.975 --> 15:04.385
It was a bit from
the glorious Ninth, by Ludwig van.

15:13.224 --> 15:15.314
What did you do that for?

15:15.594 --> 15:17.614
For being a bastard
with no manners.

15:17.924 --> 15:22.733
Without a dook of an idea about how
to comport yourself public-wise.

15:25.003 --> 15:27.803
I don't like you should
do what you done.

15:28.273 --> 15:31.673
And I'm not your brother no more
and wouldn't want to be.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.513
Watch that.

15:37.482 --> 15:42.612
Do watch that, if to continue
to be on live thou dost wish.

15:44.582 --> 15:45.852
Yarbles!

15:46.122 --> 15:48.822
Great, bouncy yarblockos to you!

15:49.292 --> 15:52.951
I'll meet you with chain
or nozh or britva anytime.

15:53.261 --> 15:55.851
I'm not having you aiming
tolchocks at me reasonless.

15:56.331 --> 15:59.201
It stands to reason,
I won't have it.

16:03.971 --> 16:07.341
A nozh scrap anytime you say.

16:22.220 --> 16:23.949
Doobidoob.

16:26.189 --> 16:28.159
A bit tired maybe.

16:30.229 --> 16:32.129
Best not to say more.

16:33.469 --> 16:35.959
Bedways is rightways now.

16:36.469 --> 16:39.558
So best we go homeways
and get a bit of spatchka.

16:39.868 --> 16:41.338
Right, right?

16:53.548 --> 16:56.247
Where I lived was with
my dada and mum

16:56.517 --> 17:00.927
in municipal flat block
18-A, Linear North.

18:26.771 --> 18:28.741
It had been a wonderful evening.

18:28.971 --> 18:32.461
And what I needed now
to give it the perfect ending

18:32.781 --> 18:35.681
was a bit
of the old Ludwig van.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.127
Oh, bliss!

19:27.697 --> 19:29.787
Bliss and heaven!

19:30.327 --> 19:34.857
It was gorgeousness and
gorgeosity made flesh.

19:35.707 --> 19:39.727
It was like a bird
of rarest spun heaven metal.

19:39.977 --> 19:43.406
Or like silvery wine
flowing in a spaceship

19:43.676 --> 19:46.476
gravity all nonsense now.

19:47.016 --> 19:48.416
As I slooshied

19:48.686 --> 19:51.706
I knew such lovely pictures.

20:11.205 --> 20:12.725
Alex. Alex!

20:19.914 --> 20:21.404
What do you want?

20:21.614 --> 20:23.174
It's past eight, Alex.

20:23.444 --> 20:26.504
You don't want to be
late for school, son.

20:27.954 --> 20:30.583
Bit of a pain in the gulliver, Mum.

20:30.883 --> 20:33.383
Leave us be,
and I'll try and sleep it off.

20:33.623 --> 20:36.383
And then I'll be as right
as dodgers for this after.

20:37.363 --> 20:40.423
But you've not been
to school all week, son.

20:40.693 --> 20:41.853
Got to rest, Mum.

20:42.433 --> 20:44.232
Got to get fit.

20:44.632 --> 20:48.122
Otherwise, I'm liable
to miss a lot more school.

20:48.402 --> 20:53.532
I'll put your breakfast in the oven.
I've got to be off meself now.

20:54.612 --> 20:58.812
All right, Mum.
Have a nice day at the factory.

21:03.151 --> 21:06.281
He's not feeling too good
again this morning, Dad.

21:06.491 --> 21:08.391
Yes. Yes, I heard.

21:08.821 --> 21:10.311
You know what time he got in?

21:10.591 --> 21:13.581
No, I don't.
I'd taken me sleepers.

21:16.230 --> 21:17.750
I wonder

21:18.130 --> 21:22.160
where exactly is it
he goes to work of evenings.

21:24.340 --> 21:25.770
Like he says

21:26.010 --> 21:28.340
it's mostly odd things he does.

21:28.610 --> 21:29.770
Helping-like

21:30.009 --> 21:32.669
here and there, as it might be.

22:14.317 --> 22:16.306
Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Deltoid.

22:16.556 --> 22:18.486
Funny surprise, seeing you here.

22:18.726 --> 22:22.656
Alex-boy!
Awake at last, yes?

22:23.296 --> 22:26.316
I met your mother
on the way to work, yes?

22:26.566 --> 22:28.556
She gave me the key.

22:31.365 --> 22:33.635
She said something about
a pain somewhere.

22:33.865 --> 22:36.805
Hence, not at school, yes?

22:37.135 --> 22:40.305
A rather intolerable pain
in the head, brother sir.

22:40.545 --> 22:42.665
It should be clear
by this after-lunch.

22:43.545 --> 22:46.135
Or certainly by this evening, yes.

22:46.415 --> 22:49.644
The evening's the great time,
isn't it, Alex-boy?

22:49.854 --> 22:53.374
- Cup of the old chai, sir?
- No time, no time.

22:53.684 --> 22:55.214
Sit, sit, sit!

22:56.824 --> 22:59.584
To what do I owe
this extreme pleasure, sir?

23:00.324 --> 23:01.484
Anything wrong, sir?

23:01.724 --> 23:05.563
Wrong? Why should you
think of anything being wrong?

23:05.833 --> 23:08.233
Have you been doing
something you shouldn't?

23:08.433 --> 23:09.733
Just a manner of speech.

23:10.003 --> 23:13.033
Yes, well, it's just a manner
of speech from your

23:13.273 --> 23:16.573
post-corrective advisor to you
that you watch out, little Alex.

23:16.773 --> 23:20.332
Because next time it's not
going to be the corrective school.

23:20.582 --> 23:24.912
Next time it'll be the Barley place,
and all my work ruined.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.952
If you've no respect
for yourself

23:27.182 --> 23:30.282
you at least might have some
for me, who sweated over you.

23:30.522 --> 23:34.581
A big, black mark, I tell you,
for every one we don't reclaim.

23:34.861 --> 23:38.051
A confession of failure
for every one of you

23:38.361 --> 23:41.231
who ends up in the stripy hole.

23:41.461 --> 23:43.301
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't.

23:43.601 --> 23:46.191
The millicents have nothing
on me, brother.

23:46.441 --> 23:47.771
Sir, I mean.

23:48.040 --> 23:50.530
Cut out this clever talk
about millicents.

23:50.770 --> 23:53.040
Just because the police
haven't picked you up

23:53.240 --> 23:56.440
doesn't mean that you've not
been up to some nastiness.

23:56.710 --> 23:59.260
There was a bit of
nastiness last night.

23:59.261 --> 24:01.810
Some very extreme
nastiness, yes?

24:02.090 --> 24:06.279
A few of a certain Billy-boy's
friends were ambulanced off late.

24:06.559 --> 24:07.919
Your name was mentioned.

24:08.159 --> 24:10.389
The words got to me
by the usual channels.

24:10.629 --> 24:13.459
Certain friends of yours
were named also.

24:13.759 --> 24:16.959
Nobody can prove anything
about anybody, as usual.

24:17.229 --> 24:18.758
I'm warning you, little Alex

24:19.068 --> 24:21.298
being a good friend
to you as always

24:21.498 --> 24:24.298
the one man in this
sore and sick community

24:24.508 --> 24:27.238
who wants to save you
from yourself!

24:46.627 --> 24:48.357
What gets into you all?

24:48.597 --> 24:51.856
We've been studying the problem
for damn well near a century.

24:52.136 --> 24:54.256
But we get no farther
with our studies.

24:54.536 --> 24:57.006
You got a good home here.
Good, loving parents.

24:57.266 --> 24:59.366
You've got not too bad of a brain.

24:59.676 --> 25:02.796
Is it some devil
that crawls inside of you?

25:03.106 --> 25:04.935
Nobody's got anything on me.

25:05.175 --> 25:07.945
I been out of the millicents'
rookers for a long time.

25:08.175 --> 25:12.675
That's just what worries me.
A bit too long to be safe.

25:12.955 --> 25:14.785
You're about due, by my reckoning.

25:15.015 --> 25:16.355
That's why I'm warning you

25:16.625 --> 25:20.054
to keep your handsome
young proboscis out of the dirt.

25:20.354 --> 25:21.684
Do I make myself clear?

25:21.894 --> 25:23.324
As an unmuddied lake, sir.

25:23.564 --> 25:26.964
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

25:27.194 --> 25:29.494
You can rely on me, sir.

26:35.630 --> 26:37.219
Excuse me, brother.

26:37.459 --> 26:41.089
I ordered this two weeks ago.
Can you see if it's arrived?

26:42.469 --> 26:43.799
Just a minute.

27:10.097 --> 27:11.717
Pardon me, ladies.

27:20.307 --> 27:22.926
Enjoying that, are you, my darling?

27:25.506 --> 27:28.836
A bit cold and pointless,
isn't it, my lovely?

27:33.246 --> 27:36.116
What's happened to yours,
my little sister?

27:38.285 --> 27:39.755
Who you getting, bratty?

27:39.985 --> 27:42.115
Goggly Gogol?
Johnny Zhivago?

27:42.355 --> 27:44.255
The Heaven 17?

27:48.595 --> 27:52.365
What you got back home
to play your fuzzy warbles on?

27:52.635 --> 27:56.864
I bet you've got little
pitiful, portable picnic players.

27:57.174 --> 27:59.294
Come with Uncle
and hear all proper.

27:59.544 --> 28:02.604
Hear angel trumpets
and devil trombones.

28:02.844 --> 28:04.864
You are invited.

29:27.258 --> 29:28.218
Hi, hi, hi, there.

29:28.458 --> 29:29.448
Well, hello.

29:29.728 --> 29:32.348
He are here!
He have arrived!

29:32.598 --> 29:34.188
Hooray!

29:34.858 --> 29:37.628
Welly, welly, welly,
welly, welly, welly, well!

29:39.368 --> 29:44.067
To what do I owe the extreme pleasure
of this surprising visit?

29:49.407 --> 29:51.107
We got worried.

29:53.977 --> 29:58.886
There we were, waiting and drinking
away at the old knifey moloko

29:59.586 --> 30:01.646
and you had not turned up.

30:02.116 --> 30:04.316
And we thought
you might have been, like

30:04.556 --> 30:06.886
offended by something
or other.

30:07.126 --> 30:09.556
So around we come to your abode.

30:14.935 --> 30:17.125
Appy polly loggies.

30:17.435 --> 30:20.565
I had something of a pain
in the gulliver, so I had to sleep.

30:20.835 --> 30:23.635
I was not awakened
when I gave orders for wakening.

30:23.905 --> 30:26.305
Sorry about the pain.

30:27.014 --> 30:29.504
Using the gulliver
too much-like, maybe.

30:32.754 --> 30:36.184
Giving orders and
discipline and such, perhaps.

30:36.684 --> 30:38.984
You sure the pain is gone?

30:39.454 --> 30:42.513
You sure you'd not
be happier back in bed?

31:04.012 --> 31:08.312
Let's get things nice
and sparkling clear.

31:11.682 --> 31:14.181
This sarcasm,
if I may call it such

31:14.391 --> 31:17.151
does not become you,
my little brothers.

31:17.691 --> 31:22.131
As I am your droog and leader
I'm entitled to know what goes on.

31:24.001 --> 31:25.191
Now then, Dim.

31:25.501 --> 31:29.630
What does that great big
horsey gape of a grin portend?

31:31.640 --> 31:35.370
All right, no more
picking on Dim, brother.

31:35.640 --> 31:38.080
That's part of the new way.

31:45.849 --> 31:49.749
New way?
What's this about a new way?

31:51.059 --> 31:55.929
There's been some very large talk
behind my sleeping back, I know it.

31:57.359 --> 32:00.258
If you must have it,
have it, then.

32:01.068 --> 32:03.688
We go around shop crasting
and the like

32:03.938 --> 32:07.528
coming out with a pitiful
rookerfull of money each.

32:07.868 --> 32:10.168
And Will the English
in the coffee mesto

32:10.408 --> 32:13.998
saying he can fence anything
any malchick tries to crast.

32:14.248 --> 32:16.177
The shiny stuff. The ice!

32:16.417 --> 32:20.437
The big, big money's available,
is what Will the English says.

32:22.517 --> 32:25.787
And what will you do
with the big, big, big money?

32:26.087 --> 32:27.957
Have you not everything you need?

32:28.257 --> 32:31.126
If you need a motorcar,
you pluck it from the trees.

32:31.426 --> 32:34.456
If you need pretty polly,
you take it.

32:34.696 --> 32:39.256
Brother, you think and talk
sometimes like a little child.

32:40.136 --> 32:42.696
Tonight we pull a man-size crast.

32:44.606 --> 32:46.975
Good! Real horror show!

32:47.205 --> 32:49.575
Initiative comes
to thems that wait.

32:50.245 --> 32:53.235
I've taught you much,
my little droogies.

32:54.645 --> 32:58.045
Now tell me what you had in mind,
Georgie-boy.

33:01.384 --> 33:04.584
The old moloko plus first.
Would you not say?

33:04.824 --> 33:08.624
- Something to sharpen us up.
- Some moloko plus.

33:10.164 --> 33:14.994
You got to go there first.
We got a start on you. Moloko Plus!

33:22.913 --> 33:25.343
As we walked along
the flatblock marina

33:25.643 --> 33:29.843
I was calm on the outside,
but thinking all the time.

33:30.113 --> 33:32.642
So now it was to be
Georgie the General

33:32.952 --> 33:35.352
saying what we should do
and what not to do.

33:35.622 --> 33:39.522
And Dim as his mindless,
grinning bulldog.

33:39.792 --> 33:43.422
But suddenly I viddied that
thinking was for the gloopy ones

33:43.692 --> 33:48.821
and that the oomny ones used, like,
inspiration and what Bog sends.

33:49.331 --> 33:53.171
For now it was lovely music
that came to my aid.

33:53.441 --> 33:56.501
There was a window open
with a stereo on

33:56.771 --> 34:00.001
and I viddied right at once
what to do.

35:05.606 --> 35:09.166
I had not cut into any
of Dim's main cables.

35:09.406 --> 35:11.706
And so with the help
of a clean tashtook

35:11.946 --> 35:14.276
the red, red kroovy
soon stopped.

35:14.546 --> 35:18.246
And it did not take long to
quieten the two wounded soldiers

35:18.445 --> 35:21.175
down in the snug
of the Duke of New York.

35:22.055 --> 35:25.575
Now they knew who was
master and leader.

35:26.095 --> 35:28.025
Sheep, thought I.

35:28.295 --> 35:30.455
But a real leader knows
always when, like

35:30.725 --> 35:33.924
to give and show generous
to his unders.

35:36.534 --> 35:38.764
Now we're back to where we were.

35:39.064 --> 35:40.364
Yes?

35:41.204 --> 35:43.464
Just like before,
and all forgotten?

35:43.744 --> 35:45.364
Right, right, right?

35:47.144 --> 35:48.274
Right.

35:51.143 --> 35:52.273
Right.

35:55.753 --> 35:56.743
Right.

35:59.723 --> 36:01.883
Well, Georgie-boy

36:02.223 --> 36:06.092
this idea of yours for tonight.
Tell us all about it, then.

36:07.762 --> 36:08.822
Not tonight.

36:09.132 --> 36:10.762
Not this nochy.

36:11.432 --> 36:13.962
Come, come, come, Georgie-boy.

36:14.572 --> 36:17.832
You're a big, strong chelloveck,
like us all.

36:18.102 --> 36:21.401
We're not little children,
are we, Georgie-boy?

36:22.071 --> 36:25.741
What, then, didst thou
in thy mind have?

36:32.581 --> 36:34.451
It's this health farm.

36:35.590 --> 36:37.580
A bit out of the town.

36:38.590 --> 36:40.080
Isolated.

36:41.160 --> 36:45.820
It's owned by this rich ptitsa
who lives there with her cats.

36:46.430 --> 36:50.929
The place is shut down for a week
and she's completely on her own.

36:52.269 --> 36:55.969
It's full up with, like,
gold and silver

36:56.209 --> 36:58.199
and, like, jewels.

36:59.679 --> 37:03.509
Tell me more, Georgie-boy.
Tell me more.

37:09.218 --> 37:10.618
Oh, shit!

37:29.407 --> 37:30.237
Who's there?

37:30.837 --> 37:32.827
Excuse me, can you please help?

37:33.077 --> 37:34.637
There's been a terrible accident!

37:34.847 --> 37:37.816
Can I please use your telephone
for an ambulance?

37:38.846 --> 37:40.816
I'm frightfully sorry.

37:41.716 --> 37:45.246
There's a telephone in the
public house a mile down the road.

37:45.516 --> 37:47.356
I suggest you use that.

37:47.556 --> 37:49.576
But missus, this is an emergency!

37:49.856 --> 37:51.656
It's a matter of life and death!

37:51.895 --> 37:55.655
Me friend's lying in the middle
of the road, bleeding to death!

37:56.665 --> 38:01.655
I'm very sorry, but I never open
the door to strangers after dark.

38:04.035 --> 38:05.835
Very well, madam.

38:06.205 --> 38:08.404
You can't be blamed
for being suspicious

38:08.674 --> 38:12.444
with so many scoundrels
and rogues of the night about.

38:12.714 --> 38:15.274
I'll try and get help
at the pub, then.

38:15.514 --> 38:17.954
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

38:18.214 --> 38:21.274
Thank you very much.
Good night.

38:57.921 --> 38:59.321
Dim, bend down.

39:01.661 --> 39:04.591
I'll get in that window
and open the front door.

39:33.189 --> 39:34.989
Radlett Police Station?

39:35.259 --> 39:39.159
Good evening. It's Miss Weathers
at Woodmere Health Farm.

39:41.158 --> 39:45.158
I'm sorry to bother you, but
something rather odd just happened.

39:45.368 --> 39:48.268
It's probably nothing at all,
but you never know.

39:49.168 --> 39:52.498
A young man rang the bell,
asking to use the telephone.

39:52.768 --> 39:54.997
He said there's been
some kind of accident.

39:55.307 --> 39:57.707
The thing that caught my
attention was what he said.

39:57.977 --> 40:01.847
His words sounded like those quoted
in the papers this morning

40:02.117 --> 40:06.317
in connection with the writer
and his wife who were assaulted.

40:07.617 --> 40:09.647
Just a few minutes ago.

40:11.956 --> 40:13.686
If you think that's necessary.

40:13.996 --> 40:16.656
But I'm quite sure
he's gone away now.

40:18.296 --> 40:19.996
All right, fine.

40:20.966 --> 40:23.056
Thank you very much.

40:27.635 --> 40:29.235
Hi, hi, hi, there.

40:29.505 --> 40:30.875
At last we meet.

40:31.075 --> 40:35.735
Our brief govorett through the
letter-hole was not satisfactory.

40:37.045 --> 40:38.345
Who are you?

40:39.545 --> 40:41.514
How the hell did you get in here?

40:43.484 --> 40:46.754
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

40:50.824 --> 40:52.594
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

40:52.864 --> 40:55.424
You filthy old soomaka.

40:55.694 --> 40:59.263
Now listen here,
you little bastard!

40:59.533 --> 41:02.993
Just turn round and walk out
of here the same way you came in.

41:06.203 --> 41:07.693
Leave that alone!
Don't touch it!

41:07.943 --> 41:10.373
It's a very important work of art.

41:21.192 --> 41:23.622
What the bloody hell do you want?

41:24.962 --> 41:27.861
To be perfectly honest, madam

41:28.131 --> 41:31.461
I'm taking part in an
international students' contest

41:31.701 --> 41:35.461
to see who can get the most
points for selling magazines.

41:35.701 --> 41:37.791
Cut the shit, sonny

41:38.071 --> 41:42.630
and get out of here before you
get yourself into serious trouble.

41:42.970 --> 41:46.030
I told you to leave that alone!
Now get out of here

41:46.240 --> 41:48.140
before I throw you out!

41:48.610 --> 41:51.450
Wretched, slummy bedbug!

41:52.050 --> 41:55.710
I'll teach you to break
into real people's houses.

41:56.960 --> 41:57.889
Fucking

41:58.119 --> 41:59.109
little

41:59.729 --> 42:01.219
bastard!

43:10.855 --> 43:13.825
- Let's go. The police are coming!
- One minoota, droogie.

43:20.534 --> 43:23.334
You bastards! I'm blind!

43:23.574 --> 43:27.634
I'm blind, you bastards!
I can't see!

43:41.523 --> 43:44.712
It's no good sitting there in hope,
my little brothers.

43:44.922 --> 43:49.222
I won't say a single solitary
slovo unless I have my lawyer here.

43:49.562 --> 43:52.152
I know the law, you bastards.

44:00.002 --> 44:01.661
Righty-right, Tom.

44:03.171 --> 44:07.041
We'll have to show our friend Alex
here that we know the law too.

44:07.341 --> 44:09.941
But that knowing the law
isn't everything.

44:24.790 --> 44:27.520
Nasty cut you've got there,
little Alex.

44:28.530 --> 44:30.430
Shame, isn't it?

44:31.299 --> 44:33.359
Spoils all your beauty.

44:35.399 --> 44:37.029
Who gave you that, then?

44:38.469 --> 44:40.199
How'd you do that, then?

44:42.709 --> 44:44.769
What's your point, you bastard?

44:45.049 --> 44:47.238
That is for your lady victim.

44:47.548 --> 44:48.738
You ghastly

44:48.978 --> 44:50.708
wretched scoundrel.

44:53.088 --> 44:54.278
Get him off me!

44:55.258 --> 44:57.378
You rotten little bastard!

45:05.627 --> 45:06.897
Good evening, Mr. Deltoid.

45:07.137 --> 45:08.797
Good evening, Sergeant.

45:09.067 --> 45:10.157
They're in room B, sir.

45:10.437 --> 45:12.067
Thank you very much.

45:13.067 --> 45:14.227
Sergeant

45:14.477 --> 45:15.407
Good evening.

45:15.677 --> 45:17.136
Good evening, Inspector.

45:17.406 --> 45:20.306
- Would you like your tea now, sir?
- No, thank you, Sergeant.

45:20.576 --> 45:22.516
May I have some
paper towels, please?

45:22.816 --> 45:25.076
We're interrogating
the prisoner now.

45:25.286 --> 45:28.916
- Perhaps you'd care to come inside.
- Thank you very much.

45:29.486 --> 45:32.455
Good evening, Sergeant.
Good evening, all.

45:34.455 --> 45:37.585
Oh, dear! This boy
does look a mess, doesn't he?

45:37.825 --> 45:39.655
Just look at the state of him.

45:39.935 --> 45:41.865
Love's young nightmare-like.

45:42.135 --> 45:44.035
Violence makes violence.

45:44.305 --> 45:46.295
He resisted his lawful arrestors.

45:47.834 --> 45:51.104
This is the end of the line for me.

45:51.304 --> 45:54.474
The end of the line, yes.

45:54.844 --> 45:56.314
And what of me, brother sir?

45:56.514 --> 45:58.204
Speak up for me.
I'm not so bad.

45:58.484 --> 46:00.474
I was led on by
the treachery of others.

46:00.714 --> 46:03.613
Sings the roof off lovely,
he does, sir.

46:03.853 --> 46:07.113
Where are my treacherous droogs?
Get them before they get away!

46:07.353 --> 46:09.183
It was all their idea, brothers.

46:09.453 --> 46:12.123
They forced me to do it.
I'm innocent!

46:18.862 --> 46:21.562
You are now a murderer,
little Alex.

46:22.302 --> 46:23.562
A murderer.

46:24.402 --> 46:26.392
Not true, sir.

46:26.642 --> 46:28.472
It was only a slight tolchok.

46:28.672 --> 46:31.202
She were breathing, I swear it.

46:31.682 --> 46:33.871
I've just come from the hospital.

46:34.151 --> 46:36.411
Your victim has died.

46:36.681 --> 46:39.841
You try to frighten me.
Admit so, sir.

46:40.091 --> 46:42.051
This is some new form of torture.

46:42.321 --> 46:45.591
- Say it, brother sir.
- It'll be your own torture.

46:45.861 --> 46:49.660
I hope to God
it'll torture you to madness.

46:51.500 --> 46:54.590
If you'd care to give him a bash
in the chops, don't mind us.

46:54.830 --> 46:56.600
We'll hold him down.

46:57.340 --> 47:00.530
He must be a great
disappointment to you, sir.

47:29.968 --> 47:33.628
This is the real weepy and tragic
part of the story beginning

47:33.908 --> 47:36.097
O my brothers and only friends.

47:36.407 --> 47:38.807
After a trial,
with judges and a jury

47:39.077 --> 47:43.307
and hard words spoken against
your friend and humble narrator

47:43.617 --> 47:47.707
he was sentenced to 14 years
in Staja Number 84-F

47:47.917 --> 47:51.446
among smelly perverts
and hardened prestoopniks.

47:51.756 --> 47:55.556
The shock sending my dada beating
his bruised and krovvy rookers

47:55.786 --> 47:58.126
against unfair Bog
in His Heaven.

47:58.396 --> 48:01.586
And my mum boo-hoo-hooing
in her mother's grief

48:01.826 --> 48:04.226
at her only child
and son of her bosom

48:04.496 --> 48:07.095
like, letting everybody down
real horror show.

48:07.335 --> 48:10.235
Morning.
One up from Thames, mister.

48:11.275 --> 48:12.895
Right! Open up the cell!

48:13.135 --> 48:14.575
Yes, sir.

48:30.854 --> 48:33.124
Here are the prisoner's
committal forms.

48:33.354 --> 48:34.844
Thank you, mister.

48:36.493 --> 48:39.193
- Name?
- Alexander DeLarge.

48:39.463 --> 48:41.363
You are now in
H.M. Prison Parkmoor.

48:41.663 --> 48:45.193
From this moment, you will address
all prison officers as "sir"

48:45.433 --> 48:46.263
Name?

48:46.473 --> 48:48.833
Alexander DeLarge, sir.

48:49.143 --> 48:50.133
Sentence?

48:50.443 --> 48:51.602
14 years, sir.

48:51.842 --> 48:52.702
Crime?

48:52.972 --> 48:54.102
Murder, sir.

48:54.382 --> 48:57.312
Right.
Take the cuffs off him, mister.

49:08.621 --> 49:11.021
You are now 655321.

49:11.291 --> 49:14.521
It is your duty
to memorize that number.

49:14.801 --> 49:16.821
Thank you, mister. Well done.

49:17.071 --> 49:18.791
- Thank you.
- Let the officer out.

49:23.070 --> 49:25.560
All right, empty your pockets.

49:29.310 --> 49:32.400
Are you able to see the white line
painted on the floor

49:32.680 --> 49:34.010
directly behind you

49:34.220 --> 49:35.580
655321?

49:38.089 --> 49:39.519
Then your toes belong

49:39.749 --> 49:41.719
on the other side of it!

49:48.759 --> 49:50.419
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

49:50.869 --> 49:52.199
Carry on.

49:57.068 --> 49:57.998
Pick that up

49:58.238 --> 50:00.998
and put it down properly.

50:11.787 --> 50:13.847
One half-bar of chocolate.

50:15.857 --> 50:18.757
One bunch of keys
on white metal ring.

50:21.857 --> 50:23.756
One packet of cigarettes.

50:26.966 --> 50:29.096
Two plastic ball pens.

50:29.366 --> 50:31.426
One black, one red.

50:34.636 --> 50:37.866
One pocket comb, black plastic.

50:38.446 --> 50:42.935
One address book,
imitation red leather.

50:51.725 --> 50:53.655
One ten-penny piece.

50:55.124 --> 50:57.714
One white metal wristlet watch

50:57.994 --> 51:01.954
Timawrist, on a white metal
expanding bracelet.

51:03.134 --> 51:05.064
Anything else in your pockets?

51:06.104 --> 51:07.594
- No, sir.
- Right.

51:07.904 --> 51:10.963
Sign here for your
valuable property.

51:19.813 --> 51:21.903
The tobacco and chocolate
you brought in

51:22.153 --> 51:23.443
you lose that

51:23.683 --> 51:25.812
as you are now convicted.

51:26.682 --> 51:29.922
Now over to the table
and get undressed.

51:36.932 --> 51:38.922
Were you in police custody
this morning?

51:39.202 --> 51:40.661
One jacket, blue pinstriped.

51:40.931 --> 51:41.991
Prison custody?

51:42.271 --> 51:43.331
Yes, sir, on remand.

51:43.531 --> 51:45.431
- One necktie, blue.
- Religion?

51:45.671 --> 51:46.761
C. of E., sir.

51:47.011 --> 51:48.701
Do you mean the Church of England?

51:48.941 --> 51:50.701
Yes, sir.
The Church of England.

51:50.941 --> 51:51.931
Brown hair, isn't it?

51:52.181 --> 51:53.341
Fair hair, sir.

51:53.611 --> 51:54.641
Blue eyes?

51:54.881 --> 51:56.280
Blue, sir.

51:56.510 --> 51:59.110
Do you wear eyeglasses
or contact lenses?

51:59.350 --> 52:00.210
No, sir.

52:00.450 --> 52:02.390
One shirt, blue.
Collar attached.

52:02.650 --> 52:06.390
Have you been receiving medical
treatment for any serious illness?

52:06.660 --> 52:09.180
One pair of boots, black leather.
Zippered. Worn.

52:09.460 --> 52:11.949
Have you ever had
any mental illness?

52:12.359 --> 52:16.059
Do you wear any false teeth
or any false limbs?

52:16.529 --> 52:18.559
One pair of trousers,
blue pinstriped.

52:18.839 --> 52:22.169
Have you ever had any attacks
of fainting or dizziness?

52:22.409 --> 52:23.999
One pair of socks, black.

52:24.209 --> 52:26.009
Are you an epileptic?

52:26.239 --> 52:28.738
One pair of underpants,
white with blue waistband.

52:28.978 --> 52:32.678
Are you now, or have you ever been,
a homosexual?

52:33.148 --> 52:34.018
Right.

52:34.248 --> 52:36.808
- The mothballs, mister.
- Mothballs, sir.

52:37.718 --> 52:39.158
Now then, face the wall

52:39.558 --> 52:42.217
bend over and touch your toes.

52:48.827 --> 52:50.357
Any venereal disease?

52:50.597 --> 52:52.157
Crabs? Lice?

52:52.367 --> 52:55.397
- Through there for the bath.
- One for a bath.

52:57.436 --> 52:58.696
What's it going to be, eh?

52:59.606 --> 53:03.066
Is it going to be in and out
of institutions like this

53:03.346 --> 53:05.336
though more in than out
for most of you?

53:05.576 --> 53:09.676
Or are you going to attend
to the divine word

53:09.946 --> 53:13.615
and realize the punishments
that await unrepentant sinners

53:13.925 --> 53:16.015
in the next world
as well as this?

53:16.255 --> 53:18.285
A lot of idiots you are

53:18.525 --> 53:23.185
selling your birthright
for a saucer of cold porridge.

53:23.465 --> 53:25.125
The thrill of theft.

53:25.435 --> 53:26.225
Of violence.

53:26.465 --> 53:29.124
The urge to live easy.

53:29.404 --> 53:32.064
Well, I ask you what is it worth

53:32.304 --> 53:34.704
when we have undeniable proof

53:34.944 --> 53:38.064
yes, incontrovertible
evidence

53:38.274 --> 53:39.604
that hell exists?

53:39.874 --> 53:41.074
I know!

53:41.384 --> 53:43.873
I know, my friends.

53:44.113 --> 53:46.213
I have been informed

53:46.453 --> 53:47.943
in visions

53:48.223 --> 53:49.713
that there is a place

53:49.923 --> 53:52.323
darker than any prison

53:52.623 --> 53:56.653
hotter than any flame
of human fire

53:56.923 --> 53:58.223
where souls

53:58.462 --> 54:02.662
of unrepentant criminal sinners
like yourselves

54:04.572 --> 54:08.262
Don't you laugh, damn you!
Don't you laugh.

54:08.472 --> 54:11.502
I say, like yourselves

54:12.012 --> 54:13.342
scream

54:13.742 --> 54:17.401
in endless and
unendurable agony.

54:18.151 --> 54:19.511
Their skin

54:19.781 --> 54:22.271
rotting and peeling.

54:22.521 --> 54:24.281
A fireball

54:24.521 --> 54:26.851
spinning in their
screaming guts!

54:27.121 --> 54:30.520
I know. Yes, I know!

54:36.830 --> 54:39.820
All right, you lot!
We'll end by singing hymn 258

54:40.100 --> 54:41.430
in the prisoner's hymnal.

54:41.670 --> 54:44.869
And let's have a little reverence,
you bastards!

54:46.509 --> 54:49.809
I was a wandering sheep

54:50.879 --> 54:53.509
- Sing up, damn you!
- I did not love the fold

54:53.779 --> 54:55.179
Louder!

54:57.519 --> 55:02.508
I did not love my shepherd's voice

55:03.158 --> 55:07.528
I would not be controlled

55:08.698 --> 55:09.788
Louder!

55:10.228 --> 55:13.288
It had not been edifying.
Indeed not.

55:13.528 --> 55:17.467
Being in this hellhole
and human zoo for two years now.

55:17.707 --> 55:20.827
Being kicked and tolchoked
by brutal warders

55:21.077 --> 55:24.037
and meeting leering criminals
and perverts

55:24.307 --> 55:25.837
ready to dribble all over

55:26.077 --> 55:29.017
a luscious young malchick
like your storyteller.

55:35.016 --> 55:36.506
It was my rabbit

55:36.816 --> 55:39.516
to help the prison charlie
with the Sunday service.

55:39.756 --> 55:42.816
He was a bolshy,
great burly bastard.

55:43.056 --> 55:46.155
But he was very fond of myself,
me being very young

55:46.395 --> 55:49.765
and also now very interested
in the Big Book.

56:10.884 --> 56:14.684
I read all about the scourging
and the crowning with thorns.

56:14.954 --> 56:16.853
And I could viddy myself
helping in

56:17.093 --> 56:21.053
and even taking charge of
the tolchoking and the nailing in.

56:21.293 --> 56:24.633
Being dressed in the height
of Roman fashion.

56:36.572 --> 56:39.072
I didn't so much like
the latter part of the Book

56:39.312 --> 56:41.472
which is more like
all preachy talking

56:41.752 --> 56:43.872
than fighting
and the old in-out.

56:44.122 --> 56:47.241
I like the parts where these old
yahoodies tolchok each other

56:47.491 --> 56:49.751
and then drink
their Hebrew vino

56:50.121 --> 56:53.221
and getting onto the bed
with their wives' handmaidens.

56:53.421 --> 56:55.451
That kept me going.

57:26.789 --> 57:29.689
"Seek not to be like evil men.

57:30.129 --> 57:32.249
Neither desire to be with them

57:32.499 --> 57:35.618
because their minds
studieth robberies

57:35.868 --> 57:38.768
and their lips speak deceits"

57:39.038 --> 57:42.488
If thou lose hope, being weary
in the days of distress

57:42.768 --> 57:45.038
thy strength
shall be diminished.

57:45.308 --> 57:46.938
Fine, my son. Fine.

57:47.178 --> 57:48.478
Father?

57:52.517 --> 57:54.207
I have tried, have I not?

57:54.487 --> 57:55.607
You have, my son.

57:55.817 --> 57:58.147
- I've done my best, have I not?
- Indeed.

57:58.387 --> 58:01.827
I've never been guilty of any
institutional infraction, have I?

58:02.027 --> 58:06.356
You certainly have not, 655321.
You've been very helpful.

58:06.626 --> 58:09.496
And you've shown
a genuine desire to reform.

58:09.726 --> 58:11.026
Father

58:12.496 --> 58:15.296
can I ask you
a question in private?

58:16.906 --> 58:18.836
Certainly, my son. Certainly.

58:29.045 --> 58:31.535
Is there something
troubling you, my son?

58:34.684 --> 58:36.984
Don't be shy to speak up.

58:39.494 --> 58:40.824
Remember

58:41.064 --> 58:43.024
I know of the

58:43.264 --> 58:47.094
urges that can
trouble young men

58:47.364 --> 58:48.894
deprived

58:49.104 --> 58:51.093
of the society of women.

58:54.003 --> 58:56.333
It's nothing like that, Father.

59:00.073 --> 59:03.443
It's about this new thing
they're all talking about.

59:04.013 --> 59:05.672
About this new treatment.

59:05.912 --> 59:08.282
It gets you out of prison
in no time.

59:08.552 --> 59:11.072
And makes sure you
never get back in again.

59:11.892 --> 59:14.122
Where did you hear about this?

59:14.392 --> 59:17.082
Who's been talking
about these things?

59:17.362 --> 59:19.762
These things get around.

59:20.032 --> 59:22.291
Two warders talk, as it might be.

59:22.531 --> 59:25.561
And somebody can't help
overhearing what they say.

59:26.101 --> 59:29.471
Then somebody picks up a scrap
of newspaper in the workshops

59:29.741 --> 59:32.371
and the newspaper
tells all about it.

59:35.281 --> 59:38.970
How about putting me in
for this new treatment?

59:40.610 --> 59:44.280
I take it you are referring

59:44.550 --> 59:46.780
to the Ludovico technique.

59:47.560 --> 59:49.890
I don't know what it's called.

59:50.120 --> 59:51.989
I just know it
gets you out quickly

59:52.289 --> 59:54.759
and makes sure you
never get back in again.

59:55.459 --> 59:58.329
That is not proven, 655321.

59:58.599 --> 01:00:02.729
In fact, it is only in the
experimental stage at this moment.

01:00:03.169 --> 01:00:05.969
It has been used, hasn't it?

01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:08.968
It has not been used
in this prison yet.

01:00:09.238 --> 01:00:11.638
The governor has grave
doubts about it.

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:15.608
And I've heard there are
very serious dangers involved.

01:00:17.588 --> 01:00:20.488
I don't care about the dangers.

01:00:22.157 --> 01:00:24.317
I just want to be good.

01:00:25.587 --> 01:00:28.257
I want for the rest
of my life to be

01:00:28.497 --> 01:00:30.587
one act of goodness.

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:32.297
The question is

01:00:32.697 --> 01:00:37.357
whether or not this technique
really makes a man good.

01:00:38.166 --> 01:00:40.496
Goodness comes from within.

01:00:40.706 --> 01:00:41.826
Goodness

01:00:42.106 --> 01:00:43.466
is chosen.

01:00:43.836 --> 01:00:45.966
When a man cannot choose

01:00:46.206 --> 01:00:48.366
he ceases to be a man.

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:55.105
I don't understand about
the whys and wherefores, Father.

01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:59.225
I only know I want to be good.

01:01:01.355 --> 01:01:03.295
Be patient, my son.

01:01:03.495 --> 01:01:05.725
Put your trust in the Lord.

01:01:07.635 --> 01:01:11.224
Instruct Thy Son
and He shall refresh thee

01:01:11.504 --> 01:01:14.364
and shall give delight
to thy soul.

01:01:14.974 --> 01:01:16.234
Amen.

01:01:44.062 --> 01:01:46.032
- Mister!
- All present and correct, sir!

01:01:46.232 --> 01:01:47.252
Right!

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:50.932
All present and correct, sir!

01:02:46.558 --> 01:02:48.048
Prisoners, halt!

01:02:48.628 --> 01:02:50.218
Now pay attention!

01:02:50.928 --> 01:02:52.728
I want you in two lines

01:02:52.928 --> 01:02:55.587
up against that wall,
facing this way.

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:57.387
Go on, move!

01:02:57.937 --> 01:02:58.897
Hurry up!

01:02:59.167 --> 01:03:00.427
Stop talking!

01:03:06.277 --> 01:03:08.837
Prisoners ready
for inspection, sir!

01:03:24.826 --> 01:03:26.016
How many to a cell?

01:03:26.295 --> 01:03:28.125
Four in this block, sir.

01:03:28.995 --> 01:03:31.295
Cram criminals together
and what do you get?

01:03:31.495 --> 01:03:34.665
Concentrated criminality.
Crime in the midst of punishment.

01:03:34.935 --> 01:03:38.635
I agree, sir. We need
larger prisons, more money.

01:03:38.835 --> 01:03:40.665
Not a chance, my dear fellow.

01:03:40.875 --> 01:03:43.204
The government can't be
concerned any longer

01:03:43.474 --> 01:03:45.174
with outmoded
penalogical theories.

01:03:45.474 --> 01:03:49.104
Soon we may need all prison
space for political offenders.

01:03:49.344 --> 01:03:52.874
Common criminals are best dealt
with on a purely curative basis.

01:03:53.184 --> 01:03:55.844
Kill the criminal reflex,
that's all.

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:58.313
Full implementation
in a year's time.

01:03:58.623 --> 01:04:00.813
Punishment means nothing to them.

01:04:01.063 --> 01:04:03.993
They enjoy their
so-called punishment.

01:04:04.293 --> 01:04:05.383
You're absolutely right, sir.

01:04:05.663 --> 01:04:08.223
Shut your bleeding hole!

01:04:08.903 --> 01:04:10.393
Who said that?

01:04:11.033 --> 01:04:12.462
I did, sir.

01:04:18.712 --> 01:04:20.402
What crime did you commit?

01:04:20.672 --> 01:04:22.732
The accidental killing
of a person, sir.

01:04:23.012 --> 01:04:25.712
He brutally murdered a woman
in furtherance of theft.

01:04:25.982 --> 01:04:27.571
Fourteen years, sir.

01:04:28.881 --> 01:04:30.041
Excellent.

01:04:31.591 --> 01:04:32.811
He's enterprising

01:04:33.021 --> 01:04:34.081
aggressive

01:04:34.361 --> 01:04:35.521
outgoing

01:04:35.761 --> 01:04:36.591
young

01:04:36.861 --> 01:04:38.191
bold

01:04:38.391 --> 01:04:39.921
vicious.

01:04:40.391 --> 01:04:41.421
He'll do.

01:04:41.701 --> 01:04:42.821
Fine.

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.550
We could still look at C-block.

01:04:44.830 --> 01:04:46.860
No, no. That's enough.
He's perfect.

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:48.830
I want his records sent to me.

01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:50.400
This vicious young hoodlum

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:52.600
will be transformed
out of all recognition.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.830
Thank you very much
for this chance.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.840
Let's hope you make
the most of it, my boy.

01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:00.599
- Shall we go to my office?
- Thank you.

01:05:07.419 --> 01:05:08.719
Come in.

01:05:10.519 --> 01:05:11.389
Sir!

01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:13.529
655321. Sir!

01:05:13.728 --> 01:05:14.718
Very good, Chief.

01:05:14.958 --> 01:05:16.518
Over to the line.
Toes behind it.

01:05:16.798 --> 01:05:19.268
Full name and number
to the governor.

01:05:20.098 --> 01:05:23.298
Alexander DeLarge, sir.
655321, sir.

01:05:26.038 --> 01:05:29.097
I don't suppose you know who
that was this morning.

01:05:29.377 --> 01:05:32.967
That was no less a personage
than the Minister of the Interior.

01:05:33.277 --> 01:05:35.207
The new Minister of the Interior.

01:05:35.477 --> 01:05:38.377
What they call a very new broom.

01:05:39.587 --> 01:05:42.987
These new ridiculous ideas
have come at last.

01:05:43.257 --> 01:05:45.556
And orders are orders

01:05:45.786 --> 01:05:49.316
though I may say to you
in confidence, I do not approve.

01:05:49.596 --> 01:05:51.826
An eye for an eye, I say.

01:05:52.126 --> 01:05:55.066
If someone hits you,
you hit back, do you not?

01:05:55.336 --> 01:05:58.996
Why should not the state,
severely hit by you hooligans

01:05:59.306 --> 01:06:01.065
not hit back also?

01:06:01.935 --> 01:06:03.905
The new view is to say "no"

01:06:04.135 --> 01:06:07.505
The new view is that
we turn the bad into good.

01:06:07.775 --> 01:06:10.765
All of which seems to me
to be grossly unjust.

01:06:11.145 --> 01:06:13.675
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!

01:06:14.145 --> 01:06:16.344
You are to be reformed.

01:06:17.184 --> 01:06:19.674
Tomorrow you will go
to this man, Brodsky.

01:06:19.984 --> 01:06:21.514
You will be leaving here.

01:06:21.794 --> 01:06:26.024
You will be transferred to
the Ludovico medical facility.

01:06:26.324 --> 01:06:30.263
It's believed you'll be able to
leave state custody in a fortnight.

01:06:30.493 --> 01:06:32.363
I suppose that prospect
pleases you?

01:06:32.663 --> 01:06:34.433
Answer the governor's question!

01:06:34.703 --> 01:06:36.033
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.

01:06:36.273 --> 01:06:38.603
I've done my best here,
I really have, sir.

01:06:38.873 --> 01:06:41.103
I'm very grateful
to all concerned, sir.

01:06:43.343 --> 01:06:45.712
Sign this where it's marked.

01:06:48.882 --> 01:06:50.942
Don't read it, sign it!

01:06:51.222 --> 01:06:54.882
It says you're willing to have
your sentence commuted

01:06:55.152 --> 01:06:58.122
to submission to
the Ludovico treatment.

01:06:58.362 --> 01:06:59.692
And this.

01:07:06.861 --> 01:07:08.461
And another copy.

01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:22.880
The next morning I was taken to

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.810
the Ludovico medical facility

01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:26.880
outside the town center.

01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:28.580
I felt a malenky bit sad

01:07:28.890 --> 01:07:30.750
having to say goodbye
to the old Staja

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:34.319
as you will, when you leave
a place you've gotten used to.

01:07:34.529 --> 01:07:36.519
Right, halt the prisoner.

01:07:41.999 --> 01:07:44.429
Good morning, sir.
I'm Chief Officer Barnes.

01:07:44.739 --> 01:07:46.499
I've got 655321

01:07:46.769 --> 01:07:50.398
on a transfer from Parkmoor
to the Ludovico Centre, sir.

01:07:50.768 --> 01:07:53.328
Good morning.
Yes, we've been expecting you.

01:07:53.578 --> 01:07:54.868
I'm Dr. Alcot.

01:07:57.178 --> 01:07:58.168
Dr. Alcot.

01:07:58.418 --> 01:07:59.748
Very good, sir.

01:08:03.547 --> 01:08:06.607
- Are you prepared for the prisoner?
- Yes, of course.

01:08:06.887 --> 01:08:10.917
I wonder if you'd mind signing
these documents, sir.

01:08:11.757 --> 01:08:13.197
There, sir.

01:08:24.636 --> 01:08:26.106
And there, sir.

01:08:31.576 --> 01:08:33.104
And there.

01:08:52.064 --> 01:08:53.624
There you are.

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:57.663
Prison escort, move forward!

01:09:00.834 --> 01:09:01.964
Halt!

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:05.773
Excuse me, sir.

01:09:12.353 --> 01:09:15.582
Is that the officer who will
take charge of the prisoner?

01:09:25.131 --> 01:09:28.622
A word of advice, doc.
You'll have to watch this one.

01:09:28.932 --> 01:09:32.421
A right brutal bastard he has been,
and will be again

01:09:32.671 --> 01:09:35.831
in spite of all his sucking up
and reading the Bible.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:39.770
We can manage things.
Show the young man to his room.

01:09:40.011 --> 01:09:42.770
Right, sir. Come this way, please.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.109
- Morning, Charlie.
- Good morning, Doctor.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.380
Good morning, Alex.

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:59.290
My name is Dr. Branom.
I'm Dr. Brodsky's assistant.

01:09:59.490 --> 01:10:01.120
Good morning, missus.
Lovely day.

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.620
Indeed, it is.

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:04.490
May I take that?

01:10:08.139 --> 01:10:10.629
- How are you feeling?
- Fine, fine.

01:10:10.869 --> 01:10:13.859
Good. In a few minutes
you'll meet Dr. Brodsky

01:10:14.069 --> 01:10:15.369
and begin your treatment.

01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:18.499
You're a very lucky boy
to have been chosen.

01:10:20.408 --> 01:10:23.008
I realize that,
and I'm very grateful.

01:10:23.348 --> 01:10:25.378
We're going to be friends,
aren't we?

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:27.018
I hope so, missus.

01:10:30.158 --> 01:10:32.588
What's the hypo for?
Sending me to sleep?

01:10:32.828 --> 01:10:34.088
Nothing of the sort.

01:10:34.558 --> 01:10:37.257
- Vitamins will it be, then?
- Something like that.

01:10:37.827 --> 01:10:41.727
You're undernourished, so after
each meal we'll give you a shot.

01:10:41.997 --> 01:10:43.437
Roll over on your right side.

01:10:43.697 --> 01:10:46.537
Loosen your pajama pants
and pull them halfway down.

01:10:56.516 --> 01:10:59.506
What exactly is the treatment here
going to be, then?

01:11:00.586 --> 01:11:02.416
It's quite simple, really.

01:11:03.016 --> 01:11:04.786
We're going to show you some films.

01:11:05.056 --> 01:11:07.385
You mean like
going to the pictures?

01:11:07.855 --> 01:11:09.445
Something like that.

01:11:09.725 --> 01:11:10.555
That's good.

01:11:10.795 --> 01:11:13.595
I like to viddy
the old films now and again.

01:11:15.635 --> 01:11:18.095
And viddy films I would.

01:11:18.605 --> 01:11:20.595
Where I was taken to, brothers

01:11:20.805 --> 01:11:22.964
was like no cine
I ever viddied before.

01:11:23.404 --> 01:11:25.534
I was bound up
in a straitjacket

01:11:25.804 --> 01:11:27.964
and my gulliver was strapped
to a headrest

01:11:28.244 --> 01:11:30.544
with wires running away from it.

01:11:30.774 --> 01:11:33.114
Then they clamped, like,
lid-locks on me eyes

01:11:33.314 --> 01:11:36.774
so that I could not shut them,
no matter how hard I tried.

01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:38.783
It seemed a bit crazy to me

01:11:39.083 --> 01:11:41.923
but I let them get on with
what they wanted to get on with.

01:11:42.153 --> 01:11:45.553
If I was to be a free malchick
again in a fortnight

01:11:45.793 --> 01:11:49.233
I would put up with much
in the meantime, O my brothers.

01:12:14.681 --> 01:12:18.021
The first film was a very good,
professional piece of cine

01:12:18.291 --> 01:12:20.191
like it was done in Hollywood.

01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:22.581
The sounds were real horror show.

01:12:22.831 --> 01:12:25.990
You could slooshy the screams
and moans very realistic.

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:28.530
You could even get
the breathing and panting

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.770
of the tolchocking malchicks
at the same time.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.870
And then what do you know?

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:36.260
Soon our dear old friend

01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:38.509
the red, red vino on tap

01:12:38.779 --> 01:12:39.939
the same in all places

01:12:40.139 --> 01:12:41.609
like it's put out
by the same firm

01:12:42.179 --> 01:12:43.809
began to flow.

01:12:44.049 --> 01:12:46.169
It was beautiful.

01:12:46.549 --> 01:12:48.849
It's funny how the colors
of the real world

01:12:49.319 --> 01:12:51.149
only seem really real

01:12:51.389 --> 01:12:53.549
when you viddy them
on a screen.

01:12:56.528 --> 01:12:58.958
Now, all the time
I was watching this

01:12:59.198 --> 01:13:01.458
I was beginning
to get very aware

01:13:01.728 --> 01:13:03.888
of, like, not feeling
all that well.

01:13:04.128 --> 01:13:08.038
And this I put down
to all the rich food and vitamins.

01:13:08.238 --> 01:13:12.567
But I tried to forget this,
concentrating on the next film

01:13:12.837 --> 01:13:15.507
which jumped right away
on a young devotchka

01:13:15.747 --> 01:13:18.577
who was being given
the old in-out, in-out

01:13:19.517 --> 01:13:21.577
first by one malchick

01:13:22.417 --> 01:13:23.577
then another.

01:13:24.646 --> 01:13:26.176
Then another.

01:13:29.156 --> 01:13:31.556
When it came to
the 6th or 7th malchick

01:13:31.856 --> 01:13:35.316
leering and smecking
and then going into it

01:13:35.566 --> 01:13:38.756
I began to feel really sick.

01:13:39.366 --> 01:13:41.885
But I could not shut me glazzies.

01:13:42.165 --> 01:13:45.565
And even if I tried to move
my glazzballs about

01:13:45.835 --> 01:13:47.825
I still could not get out of

01:13:48.075 --> 01:13:50.765
the line of fire
of this picture.

01:13:53.515 --> 01:13:55.075
Get me up.

01:13:55.444 --> 01:13:57.244
I'm going to be sick.

01:13:58.254 --> 01:14:00.274
Get something for me to be sick in!

01:14:04.584 --> 01:14:07.454
Very soon now,
the drug will cause the subject

01:14:07.694 --> 01:14:09.924
to experience
a deathlike paralysis

01:14:10.194 --> 01:14:14.023
together with deep feelings
of terror and helplessness.

01:14:14.903 --> 01:14:18.733
One of our early test subjects
described it as being like death.

01:14:18.933 --> 01:14:21.923
A sense of stifling or drowning.

01:14:22.643 --> 01:14:25.303
And it is during this period,
we have found

01:14:25.573 --> 01:14:29.242
the subject will make
his most rewarding associations

01:14:29.442 --> 01:14:33.242
between his catastrophic
experience, environment

01:14:33.482 --> 01:14:36.472
and the violence he sees.

01:14:38.292 --> 01:14:40.282
Dr. Brodsky is pleased with you.

01:14:40.592 --> 01:14:42.951
You've made
a very positive response.

01:14:44.061 --> 01:14:47.961
Tomorrow there will be two
sessions, morning and afternoon.

01:14:48.161 --> 01:14:51.221
You mean I have to viddy
two sessions in one day?

01:14:51.431 --> 01:14:54.591
I imagine you'll feel a bit
limp by the end of the day.

01:14:54.831 --> 01:14:58.170
But we have to be hard on you.
You have to be cured.

01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:59.500
It was horrible.

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:01.300
Of course it was horrible.

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.980
Violence is a very horrible thing.

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.940
That's what you're learning now.

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:07.440
Your body's learning it.

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:10.810
I just don't understand about
feeling sick the way I did.

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:14.319
I never used to feel sick.
I used to feel the very opposite.

01:15:14.589 --> 01:15:17.489
Doing it or watching it,
I used to feel real horror show.

01:15:18.359 --> 01:15:21.849
You felt ill this afternoon
because you're getting better.

01:15:22.129 --> 01:15:25.289
When we're healthy,
we respond to the hateful

01:15:25.529 --> 01:15:27.518
with fear and nausea.

01:15:27.768 --> 01:15:29.958
You're becoming healthy,
that's all.

01:15:30.198 --> 01:15:32.068
By this time tomorrow,
you'll be healthier still.

01:16:26.035 --> 01:16:28.065
It was the next day, brothers

01:16:28.275 --> 01:16:29.834
and I had truly done my best

01:16:30.104 --> 01:16:32.504
morning and afternoon
to play it their way

01:16:32.774 --> 01:16:35.574
and sit like a horror show
cooperative malchick

01:16:35.784 --> 01:16:37.334
in the chair of torture

01:16:37.584 --> 01:16:41.784
while they flashed nasty bits
of ultra-violence on the screen

01:16:42.254 --> 01:16:46.743
though not on the soundtrack,
the only sound being music.

01:16:47.723 --> 01:16:50.283
Then I noticed,
in all my pain and sickness

01:16:50.563 --> 01:16:54.463
what music it was
that, like, cracked and boomed.

01:16:55.403 --> 01:16:57.893
It was Ludwig van.

01:16:58.433 --> 01:17:00.962
Ninth Symphony, fourth movement.

01:17:16.651 --> 01:17:19.711
Stop it! Stop it!
Please, I beg you!

01:17:20.251 --> 01:17:21.451
It's a sin!

01:17:21.821 --> 01:17:23.451
It's a sin!

01:17:28.931 --> 01:17:29.991
Sin?

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:31.820
What's all this about sin?

01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:33.230
That!

01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:37.460
Using Ludwig van like that.
He did no harm to anyone.

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:40.170
Beethoven just wrote music.

01:17:40.810 --> 01:17:44.010
Are you referring
to the background score?

01:17:45.579 --> 01:17:47.509
You've heard Beethoven before?

01:17:49.679 --> 01:17:51.619
So you're keen on music?

01:17:56.959 --> 01:17:58.759
Can't be helped.

01:17:59.489 --> 01:18:02.288
Here's the punishment
element perhaps.

01:18:03.298 --> 01:18:05.418
The governor ought to be pleased.

01:18:08.198 --> 01:18:10.138
I'm sorry, Alex.

01:18:10.438 --> 01:18:12.128
This is for your own good.

01:18:12.368 --> 01:18:14.768
You'll have to bear with us
for a while.

01:18:15.608 --> 01:18:19.267
But it's not fair.
It's not fair I should feel ill

01:18:19.507 --> 01:18:22.447
when I hear lovely,
lovely Ludwig van.

01:18:22.977 --> 01:18:25.317
You must take your chance, boy.

01:18:25.787 --> 01:18:28.277
The choice has been all yours.

01:18:29.787 --> 01:18:32.516
You needn't take it
any further, sir.

01:18:32.856 --> 01:18:35.796
You've proved to me all this
ultra-violence and killing

01:18:36.056 --> 01:18:39.286
is wrong, wrong
and terribly wrong!

01:18:39.696 --> 01:18:41.496
I've learned me lesson, sir.

01:18:41.736 --> 01:18:44.636
I see now what I've
never seen before.

01:18:44.866 --> 01:18:47.835
I'm cured. Praise God!

01:18:48.135 --> 01:18:50.535
You're not cured yet, boy.

01:18:51.405 --> 01:18:52.875
But, sirs.

01:18:53.145 --> 01:18:54.475
Missus!

01:18:54.815 --> 01:18:56.905
I see that it's wrong!

01:18:57.175 --> 01:19:01.205
It's wrong because
it's, like, against society.

01:19:01.515 --> 01:19:04.144
Because everybody has the
right to live and be happy

01:19:04.384 --> 01:19:07.184
without being
tolchocked and knifed!

01:19:07.494 --> 01:19:10.514
No, no, boy.
You really must leave it to us.

01:19:10.824 --> 01:19:12.414
But be cheerful about it.

01:19:12.724 --> 01:19:15.994
In less than a fortnight now,
you'll be a free man.

01:19:54.401 --> 01:19:55.631
Ladies and gentlemen

01:19:55.871 --> 01:19:58.771
at this stage, we introduce
the subject himself.

01:19:58.971 --> 01:20:01.941
He is, as you will perceive,
fit and well-nourished.

01:20:02.211 --> 01:20:05.070
He comes straight from a night's
sleep and a good breakfast

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:06.270
undrugged

01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:08.380
unhypnotized.

01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:12.310
Tomorrow we send him out with
confidence into the world again

01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:16.210
as decent a lad as you
would meet on a May morning.

01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:19.749
What a change is here,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:20:19.989 --> 01:20:22.389
From the hoodlum
the state committed

01:20:22.589 --> 01:20:25.389
to unprofitable punishment
two years ago.

01:20:25.599 --> 01:20:28.389
Unchanged after two years.

01:20:29.129 --> 01:20:31.329
Unchanged, do I say?

01:20:31.599 --> 01:20:33.069
Not quite.

01:20:33.299 --> 01:20:37.998
Prison taught him the false smile,
the rubbed hands of hypocrisy.

01:20:38.308 --> 01:20:41.608
The fawning, greased,
obsequious leer.

01:20:42.078 --> 01:20:43.938
Other vices it taught him

01:20:44.178 --> 01:20:48.078
as well as confirming him in
those he had long practiced before.

01:20:49.288 --> 01:20:52.307
Our party promised
to restore law and order

01:20:52.587 --> 01:20:56.617
and to make the streets safe for
the ordinary peace-loving citizen.

01:20:56.927 --> 01:21:00.917
This pledge is now
about to become a reality.

01:21:01.167 --> 01:21:04.856
Ladies and gentlemen,
today is an historic moment.

01:21:05.136 --> 01:21:09.656
The problem of criminal violence
is soon to be a thing of the past.

01:21:10.636 --> 01:21:12.536
But enough of words.

01:21:12.836 --> 01:21:15.036
Actions speak louder than.

01:21:15.306 --> 01:21:17.006
Action now.

01:21:17.476 --> 01:21:19.446
Observe all.

01:21:29.055 --> 01:21:31.645
Our necks are out
a long way on this, Minister.

01:21:31.855 --> 01:21:33.985
I have complete faith in Brodsky.

01:21:34.225 --> 01:21:37.384
If the polls are right,
we have nothing to lose.

01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:48.874
Hello, heap of dirt.

01:21:51.673 --> 01:21:55.973
You don't wash much, do you,
judging by the horrible smell.

01:21:56.543 --> 01:21:58.983
Why do you say that?
I had a shower this morning.

01:21:59.213 --> 01:22:01.883
He had a shower this morning.

01:22:02.353 --> 01:22:04.413
You trying to call me a liar?

01:22:04.693 --> 01:22:05.523
No, brother.

01:22:05.893 --> 01:22:09.012
You must think I'm awfully stupid.

01:22:14.662 --> 01:22:16.492
Why did you do that, brother?

01:22:16.702 --> 01:22:18.672
I've never done wrong to you.

01:22:18.902 --> 01:22:20.992
You want to know why I did that?

01:22:21.402 --> 01:22:22.431
Well, you see

01:22:22.701 --> 01:22:23.931
I do this

01:22:24.211 --> 01:22:25.401
and that

01:22:25.711 --> 01:22:28.901
and this because I don't like
your horrible type, do I?

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:31.441
And if you want
to start something

01:22:31.711 --> 01:22:34.241
you just go ahead.
Go on!

01:22:34.451 --> 01:22:35.681
Please do!

01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:39.110
I'm going to be sick.

01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:41.620
You're going to be sick, are you?

01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:44.290
I'm going to be sick.
Please let me get up.

01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:46.620
You want to get up?

01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:48.720
Well, now you listen to me.

01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:51.020
If you want to get up

01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:53.469
you've got to
do something for me.

01:22:54.199 --> 01:22:55.359
Here.

01:22:55.869 --> 01:22:57.029
Here.

01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:59.369
You see that?

01:23:00.369 --> 01:23:01.809
You see that shoe?

01:23:03.209 --> 01:23:04.609
I want you to lick it.

01:23:04.879 --> 01:23:06.139
Go on!

01:23:07.209 --> 01:23:08.698
Lick it!

01:23:11.788 --> 01:23:14.118
And, O my brothers,
would you believe

01:23:14.388 --> 01:23:17.718
your faithful friend
and long-suffering narrator

01:23:17.958 --> 01:23:20.318
pushed out his red yabzick
a mile and a half

01:23:20.588 --> 01:23:23.427
to lick the grahzny,
vonny boots.

01:23:24.227 --> 01:23:25.257
And again!

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:27.927
The horrible killing sickness
had whooshed up

01:23:28.167 --> 01:23:29.797
and turned the joy of battle

01:23:30.597 --> 01:23:33.227
into a feeling
I was going to snuff it.

01:23:33.467 --> 01:23:34.767
And again.

01:23:35.277 --> 01:23:37.267
Nice and clean.

01:23:39.946 --> 01:23:41.066
Thank you very much.

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:43.146
That will do very well.

01:23:47.346 --> 01:23:49.646
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:25:00.151 --> 01:25:01.811
She came towards me

01:25:02.051 --> 01:25:05.821
with the light, like it was the
light light of heavenly grace.

01:25:06.061 --> 01:25:08.251
And the thing that flashed
in me gulliver

01:25:08.561 --> 01:25:11.150
was that I'd like to have her
there on the floor

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:14.660
with the old in-out,
real savage.

01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:33.109
But quick as a shot
came the sickness.

01:25:33.379 --> 01:25:35.879
Like a detective who'd been
watching around the corner

01:25:36.719 --> 01:25:39.419
and now followed
to make his arrest.

01:25:52.538 --> 01:25:53.398
Enough!

01:25:53.738 --> 01:25:55.398
Thank you very much.

01:25:55.608 --> 01:25:57.397
Thank you, my dear.

01:26:19.256 --> 01:26:21.886
Not feeling too bad now, are you?

01:26:22.296 --> 01:26:24.596
No, sir.
I feel really great, sir.

01:26:24.796 --> 01:26:26.766
- Good.
- Was it all right, sir?

01:26:26.966 --> 01:26:27.795
Did I do well?

01:26:28.065 --> 01:26:31.405
Fine, my boy.
Absolutely fine.

01:26:31.635 --> 01:26:32.895
You see, ladies and gentlemen

01:26:33.135 --> 01:26:35.605
our subject is impelled
towards the good

01:26:35.905 --> 01:26:39.505
by paradoxically
being impelled towards evil.

01:26:39.815 --> 01:26:41.475
The intention to act violently

01:26:41.745 --> 01:26:45.144
is accompanied by strong
feelings of physical distress.

01:26:45.414 --> 01:26:48.074
To counter these,
the subject has to switch

01:26:48.324 --> 01:26:51.284
to a diametrically
opposed attitude.

01:26:51.954 --> 01:26:53.324
Any questions?

01:26:53.594 --> 01:26:54.994
Choice!

01:26:58.463 --> 01:27:01.993
The boy has no real choice, has he?

01:27:02.203 --> 01:27:03.753
Self-interest.

01:27:04.033 --> 01:27:05.863
The fear of physical pain

01:27:06.133 --> 01:27:10.663
drove him to that
grotesque act of self-abasement.

01:27:11.443 --> 01:27:13.502
Its insincerity
was clearly to be seen.

01:27:13.712 --> 01:27:15.612
He ceases to be a wrongdoer.

01:27:15.842 --> 01:27:20.442
He ceases also to be
a creature capable of moral choice.

01:27:20.712 --> 01:27:23.012
Padre, these are subtleties.

01:27:23.282 --> 01:27:26.382
We're not concerned with motives,
with the higher ethics.

01:27:26.652 --> 01:27:30.351
We are concerned only
with cutting down crime.

01:27:32.661 --> 01:27:37.291
And with relieving the ghastly
congestion in our prisons.

01:27:37.831 --> 01:27:40.301
He will be your true Christian

01:27:40.571 --> 01:27:42.661
ready to turn the other cheek.

01:27:42.871 --> 01:27:45.900
Ready to be crucified,
rather than crucify.

01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:50.240
Sick to the very heart at the
thought even of killing a fly.

01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:51.880
Reclamation.

01:27:52.150 --> 01:27:54.340
Joy before the angels of God.

01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:57.710
The point is that it works!

01:28:02.089 --> 01:28:05.419
And the very next day,
your friend and humble narrator

01:28:05.689 --> 01:28:07.719
was a free man.

01:28:46.126 --> 01:28:47.566
Son!

01:28:49.136 --> 01:28:51.466
Hi, hi, hi there, my Pee and Em.

01:28:52.766 --> 01:28:54.036
Mum.

01:28:55.806 --> 01:28:58.206
How are you, love?
Nice to see you.

01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:02.205
- Dad.
- Lad. What a surprise.

01:29:02.445 --> 01:29:04.535
- Good to see you.
- Keeping fit?

01:29:05.285 --> 01:29:06.545
How are you, then?

01:29:06.785 --> 01:29:08.905
I'm fine, fine.

01:29:09.155 --> 01:29:11.115
Keeping out of trouble, you know.

01:29:13.885 --> 01:29:15.615
I'm back!

01:29:18.324 --> 01:29:19.314
Good to see you.

01:29:19.594 --> 01:29:22.754
Why didn't you let us know
what was happening?

01:29:23.094 --> 01:29:26.224
I wanted it to be, like,
a big surprise for you and Pee.

01:29:26.504 --> 01:29:29.404
It's a surprise, all right.
A bit bewildering too.

01:29:29.634 --> 01:29:32.473
We've only just read about it
in morning papers.

01:29:32.743 --> 01:29:34.503
You should have let us know, lad.

01:29:35.173 --> 01:29:39.113
Not that we're not very pleased
to see you again, and all

01:29:39.413 --> 01:29:40.843
cured too, eh?

01:29:41.113 --> 01:29:43.173
That's right.
They did a great job on me.

01:29:43.483 --> 01:29:46.073
I'm completely reformed.

01:29:49.792 --> 01:29:51.482
Still the same old place, then?

01:30:04.001 --> 01:30:06.831
There's a strange fellow
sitting on the sofa

01:30:07.101 --> 01:30:10.201
munchy-wunching
lomticks of toast.

01:30:13.211 --> 01:30:15.011
That's Joe.

01:30:16.951 --> 01:30:18.850
He lives here now.

01:30:19.150 --> 01:30:20.480
The lodger.

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:22.340
That's what he is.

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:24.710
He rents your room.

01:30:35.399 --> 01:30:36.889
How do you do, Joe?

01:30:37.129 --> 01:30:39.159
Find the room comfortable, do you?

01:30:39.399 --> 01:30:41.369
No complaints?

01:30:44.469 --> 01:30:46.339
I've heard about you.

01:30:47.409 --> 01:30:49.138
I know what you've done.

01:30:53.518 --> 01:30:57.148
Breaking the hearts of your
poor, grieving parents.

01:30:58.158 --> 01:30:59.878
So you're back, eh?

01:31:00.158 --> 01:31:04.817
Back to make life a misery for
your lovely parents once more?

01:31:05.097 --> 01:31:06.557
Over my dead corpse, you will.

01:31:06.857 --> 01:31:10.157
Because, you see, they've let me
be more like a son to them

01:31:10.367 --> 01:31:12.357
than like a lodger.

01:31:13.937 --> 01:31:16.497
Don't go fighting here, boys.

01:31:22.376 --> 01:31:24.206
Do put your hand
over your mouth, please.

01:31:24.506 --> 01:31:25.706
It's bloody revolting.

01:31:31.246 --> 01:31:32.846
Are you all right?

01:31:34.015 --> 01:31:35.685
It's the treatment.

01:31:35.925 --> 01:31:38.545
It's disgusting.
Enough to put you off your food.

01:31:38.795 --> 01:31:42.595
Leave him be, Joe.
It's the treatment.

01:31:44.695 --> 01:31:47.525
Do you think we ought
to do something?

01:31:48.565 --> 01:31:51.904
Would you like me to make you
a nice cup of tea, son?

01:32:02.644 --> 01:32:05.743
What have you done
with all me own personal things?

01:32:10.053 --> 01:32:12.813
That was all

01:32:13.053 --> 01:32:14.713
took away, son.

01:32:15.293 --> 01:32:17.093
By the police.

01:32:17.493 --> 01:32:19.433
New regulation, see

01:32:19.663 --> 01:32:22.722
about compensation
for the victims.

01:32:25.402 --> 01:32:27.062
What about Basil?

01:32:30.072 --> 01:32:31.802
Where is my snake?

01:32:42.081 --> 01:32:43.281
He met with

01:32:43.521 --> 01:32:45.311
like, an accident.

01:32:49.291 --> 01:32:50.760
He passed away.

01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:58.190
What's going to happen to me, then?

01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:01.700
I mean

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:04.270
that's my room he's in.

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:06.369
There's no denying that.

01:33:07.439 --> 01:33:09.999
This is my home also.

01:33:11.949 --> 01:33:15.379
What suggestions have you,
my Pee and Em, to make?

01:33:21.318 --> 01:33:23.878
All this needs thinking about, son.

01:33:25.158 --> 01:33:27.988
We can't very well
just kick Joe out.

01:33:28.228 --> 01:33:30.028
Not just like that, can we?

01:33:30.328 --> 01:33:31.348
I mean

01:33:31.628 --> 01:33:33.568
Joe's here doing a job.

01:33:33.828 --> 01:33:36.128
A contract it is.
Two years.

01:33:36.368 --> 01:33:40.067
We made, like, an arrangement.
Didn't we, Joe?

01:33:41.837 --> 01:33:43.807
You see, son

01:33:45.147 --> 01:33:48.667
Joe's paid next month's
rent already

01:33:50.217 --> 01:33:53.046
so whatever we may do in
the future, we can't just say

01:33:53.316 --> 01:33:56.306
to Joe to get out, now can we?

01:33:56.716 --> 01:33:58.586
No, but it's much more than that.

01:33:59.486 --> 01:34:01.886
I mean, I've got you two
to think of

01:34:02.156 --> 01:34:05.026
who've been like
a father and mother to me.

01:34:05.266 --> 01:34:08.255
It wouldn't be right for me
to go off and leave you two

01:34:08.535 --> 01:34:11.395
to the tender mercies
of this young monster

01:34:11.705 --> 01:34:14.895
who's been like
no real son at all.

01:34:15.575 --> 01:34:17.905
Look, he's weeping now.

01:34:18.105 --> 01:34:21.095
But that's all his craft
and artfulness.

01:34:21.405 --> 01:34:24.174
Let him go and find
a room somewhere else.

01:34:24.414 --> 01:34:28.714
Let him learn the errors
of his way, and that a bad boy

01:34:28.954 --> 01:34:32.444
doesn't deserve such a good
mum and dad as he's had.

01:34:38.123 --> 01:34:39.423
All right.

01:34:40.523 --> 01:34:42.393
I know how things are now.

01:34:43.893 --> 01:34:46.453
I've suffered and I've suffered

01:34:46.733 --> 01:34:48.703
and I've suffered.

01:34:49.403 --> 01:34:52.603
And everybody wants me
to go on suffering.

01:34:54.572 --> 01:34:56.732
You've made others suffer.

01:34:57.242 --> 01:35:00.402
It's only right
that you should suffer proper.

01:35:01.312 --> 01:35:02.972
I've been told
everything you've done

01:35:03.252 --> 01:35:05.212
sitting around the family table.

01:35:05.452 --> 01:35:08.542
And pretty shocking
it was to listen to.

01:35:09.451 --> 01:35:12.621
It made me real sick,
a lot of it did.

01:35:14.591 --> 01:35:18.151
Now look what you've gone
and done to your mother.

01:35:18.461 --> 01:35:20.051
Come on. It's all right now.

01:35:33.010 --> 01:35:34.140
Right!

01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:36.610
I'm leaving now.

01:35:36.850 --> 01:35:39.010
You won't ever viddy me no more.

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.979
I'll make me own way.

01:35:41.449 --> 01:35:45.079
Thank you very much. Let it lie
heavy on your consciences.

01:35:46.459 --> 01:35:49.359
Now don't take it like that, son.

01:36:51.655 --> 01:36:54.585
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

01:36:56.424 --> 01:36:59.514
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

01:37:03.194 --> 01:37:06.254
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

01:37:27.582 --> 01:37:29.052
Thanks, brother.

01:37:46.971 --> 01:37:48.801
Jamey Mack!

01:37:49.271 --> 01:37:50.741
May the hokey fly!

01:37:51.071 --> 01:37:54.631
Mother of God and all the blessed
saints in heaven preserve us!

01:37:56.311 --> 01:37:58.400
I never forget a face, me God!

01:37:58.650 --> 01:38:00.040
I never forget any face.

01:38:00.250 --> 01:38:03.040
Leave me alone, brother.
I've never seen you before!

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:06.740
This is the poisonous young swine
that near done me in.

01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:08.150
Him and his friends.

01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:11.320
They beat me and kicked me
and punched me.

01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:13.079
Stop him! Stop him!

01:38:13.329 --> 01:38:17.259
They laughed at me blood
and me moans, this murderous dog!

01:38:17.499 --> 01:38:20.929
Then there was like
a sea of dirty, smelly old men

01:38:21.129 --> 01:38:23.229
trying to get at
your humble narrator

01:38:23.469 --> 01:38:27.169
with their feeble rookers
and horny old claws.

01:38:27.409 --> 01:38:30.168
It was old age
having a go at youth.

01:38:30.908 --> 01:38:34.138
And I daren't do a single
solitary thing, O my brothers.

01:38:34.478 --> 01:38:36.468
It being better
to be hit at like that

01:38:36.678 --> 01:38:39.278
than want to sick
and feel that horrible pain.

01:38:39.518 --> 01:38:40.948
All right, all right!

01:38:41.188 --> 01:38:42.088
Stop it now!

01:38:42.318 --> 01:38:45.687
Come on. Stop breaking the
state's peace, you naughty boys!

01:38:45.987 --> 01:38:48.787
Back away! Go away with you!

01:38:49.027 --> 01:38:51.327
What's your trouble, sir?

01:38:58.966 --> 01:39:00.336
Well!

01:39:01.006 --> 01:39:03.476
Well, well, well!

01:39:07.376 --> 01:39:09.936
If it isn't little Alex.

01:39:10.146 --> 01:39:11.516
Long time no viddy, droog.

01:39:11.786 --> 01:39:13.216
How goes?

01:39:13.486 --> 01:39:14.705
It's impossible.

01:39:14.985 --> 01:39:16.215
I don't believe it.

01:39:16.455 --> 01:39:18.315
Evidence of the old glazzies.

01:39:18.555 --> 01:39:20.355
Nothing up our sleeves.

01:39:20.625 --> 01:39:22.645
No magic, little Alex.

01:39:22.895 --> 01:39:26.345
A job for two
who are now of job age.

01:39:26.725 --> 01:39:28.165
The police.

01:39:43.914 --> 01:39:45.073
Come on, Alex.

01:39:45.383 --> 01:39:46.873
Come for walking.

01:39:58.493 --> 01:40:00.922
Come, come, come,
my little droogies.

01:40:01.162 --> 01:40:02.682
I just don't get this at all.

01:40:02.932 --> 01:40:05.092
The old days are dead and gone.

01:40:05.362 --> 01:40:08.232
For what I did in the past,
I've been punished.

01:40:08.502 --> 01:40:10.162
I've been cured.

01:40:10.402 --> 01:40:11.592
That was read out to us.

01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:13.702
The inspector read it
all out to us.

01:40:13.942 --> 01:40:16.671
He said it was a very good way.

01:40:16.871 --> 01:40:18.101
But what is all this?

01:40:18.411 --> 01:40:20.901
It was them
that went for me, brothers.

01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:23.841
You're not on their side,
and can't be.

01:40:24.411 --> 01:40:26.581
You can't be, Dim.

01:40:26.851 --> 01:40:29.511
It was someone we fillied with
back in the old days

01:40:29.751 --> 01:40:33.240
trying to get his own revenge
after all this time. Remember?

01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:34.890
A long time is right.

01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:37.420
I don't remember them days
too horror show.

01:40:37.630 --> 01:40:39.720
And don't call me Dim
no more, either.

01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:42.060
Officer, call me.

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:45.860
Enough is remembered, though,
little Alex.

01:40:46.469 --> 01:40:49.559
And this is to make sure
you stay cured.

01:41:45.496 --> 01:41:46.616
That's enough.

01:41:46.856 --> 01:41:49.485
A bit more. He's still kicking.

01:42:08.344 --> 01:42:10.214
Cured, are you?

01:42:11.844 --> 01:42:15.684
Be viddying you some more
sometime, droogie.

01:42:31.003 --> 01:42:34.962
Where was I to go,
who had no home and no money?

01:42:35.202 --> 01:42:37.472
I cried for meself.

01:42:37.742 --> 01:42:40.542
Home, home, home.

01:42:40.812 --> 01:42:42.642
It was home I was wanting.

01:42:42.912 --> 01:42:45.902
And it was home
I came to, brothers

01:42:46.182 --> 01:42:48.842
not realizing,
in the state I was in

01:42:49.051 --> 01:42:52.041
where I was
and had been before.

01:43:40.268 --> 01:43:42.258
Who on earth could that be?

01:43:57.817 --> 01:43:59.547
I'll see who it is.

01:44:11.096 --> 01:44:12.616
Yes, what is it?

01:44:21.305 --> 01:44:22.495
Please.

01:44:39.354 --> 01:44:42.684
Frank, I think this young man
needs some help.

01:44:47.424 --> 01:44:48.824
My God!

01:44:49.834 --> 01:44:52.023
What's happened to you, my boy?

01:44:54.503 --> 01:44:58.193
And would you believe it,
O my brothers and only friends

01:44:58.433 --> 01:45:00.663
there was your
faithful narrator

01:45:00.973 --> 01:45:03.373
being held helpless
like a babe in arms

01:45:03.643 --> 01:45:06.013
and suddenly realizing
where he was

01:45:06.313 --> 01:45:09.682
and why "home" on the gate
had looked so familiar.

01:45:09.952 --> 01:45:11.712
But I knew I was safe.

01:45:11.952 --> 01:45:13.972
I knew he would not remember me.

01:45:14.222 --> 01:45:15.982
For in those carefree days

01:45:16.222 --> 01:45:18.122
I and my so-called droogs

01:45:18.352 --> 01:45:21.852
wore our maskies, which were
like real horror show disguises.

01:45:23.191 --> 01:45:24.351
Police.

01:45:28.031 --> 01:45:30.231
Ghastly, horrible police

01:45:32.241 --> 01:45:33.791
they beat me up, sir.

01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:40.470
The police beat me up.

01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:44.210
I know you!

01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:50.540
Isn't it your picture
in the newspapers?

01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:53.020
Didn't I see you
on the video this morning?

01:45:53.259 --> 01:45:56.589
Are you not the poor victim
of this horrible new technique?

01:45:56.889 --> 01:45:58.159
Yes, sir.

01:45:58.659 --> 01:46:01.819
That's exactly who I am and
what I am, sir. A victim.

01:46:02.059 --> 01:46:05.189
Then, by God, you've been
sent here by providence!

01:46:05.429 --> 01:46:08.528
Tortured in prison, then
tortured by the police.

01:46:08.768 --> 01:46:13.268
My heart goes out to you.
You're not the first to come here.

01:46:13.538 --> 01:46:16.408
The police like to bring
their victims to this village.

01:46:16.678 --> 01:46:18.038
But it's providential that you

01:46:18.348 --> 01:46:21.838
who are also another kind
of victim, should come here.

01:46:23.788 --> 01:46:26.777
But you're cold and shivering.

01:46:27.357 --> 01:46:28.717
Julian

01:46:28.957 --> 01:46:31.217
draw a bath for this young man.

01:46:31.457 --> 01:46:32.787
Certainly, Frank.

01:46:33.197 --> 01:46:34.787
Thank you very much.

01:46:35.097 --> 01:46:36.687
God bless you.

01:47:31.613 --> 01:47:33.913
He can be the most potent
weapon imaginable

01:47:34.153 --> 01:47:37.313
to ensure the government
is not returned in the election.

01:47:37.583 --> 01:47:39.353
The government's big boast, sir

01:47:39.653 --> 01:47:42.312
is the way they have
dealt with crime:

01:47:42.592 --> 01:47:44.422
Recruiting young roughs
into the police

01:47:44.662 --> 01:47:47.752
proposing will-sapping
techniques of conditioning.

01:47:47.992 --> 01:47:50.192
We've seen it before
in other countries.

01:47:50.462 --> 01:47:51.932
The thin end of the wedge.

01:47:52.162 --> 01:47:56.261
Before we know it, we'll have the
full apparatus of totalitarianism.

01:48:00.341 --> 01:48:04.711
This young boy is a living witness
to these diabolical proposals.

01:48:04.941 --> 01:48:08.681
The people, the common people,
must know, must see.

01:48:08.951 --> 01:48:13.320
There are traditions of liberty to
defend. That tradition is all.

01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:15.520
The common people
will let it go, yes.

01:48:15.790 --> 01:48:17.880
They'll sell liberty
for a quieter life.

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:19.680
That is why they must be led.

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:22.020
Driven. Pushed.

01:48:27.069 --> 01:48:28.359
Fine.

01:48:29.369 --> 01:48:31.029
Thank you very much, sir.

01:48:33.069 --> 01:48:34.629
He'll be here.

01:48:37.879 --> 01:48:41.179
I'm singing in the rain

01:48:41.908 --> 01:48:44.878
Just singing in the rain

01:48:45.718 --> 01:48:48.878
What a glorious feeling

01:48:49.258 --> 01:48:52.658
I'm hap-hap-happy again

01:48:53.228 --> 01:48:56.348
I'm laughing at clouds

01:48:57.158 --> 01:48:59.717
So dark up above

01:49:00.697 --> 01:49:03.187
The sun's in my heart

01:49:03.997 --> 01:49:07.937
I'm ready for love

01:49:08.867 --> 01:49:11.597
Let the stormy clouds chase

01:49:12.237 --> 01:49:15.076
Everyone from the place

01:49:16.576 --> 01:49:21.536
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face

01:49:22.186 --> 01:49:25.176
I'll walk down the lane

01:49:59.423 --> 01:50:00.813
Good evening, sir.

01:50:04.793 --> 01:50:06.313
Good evening.

01:50:06.893 --> 01:50:09.723
It was very kind of you
to leave this out for me.

01:50:09.963 --> 01:50:12.393
There was no one around,
so I started.

01:50:12.633 --> 01:50:14.462
Hope that's all right, sir.

01:50:18.002 --> 01:50:19.662
Of course.

01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:52.930
Food all right?

01:50:58.670 --> 01:51:00.339
Great, sir. Great.

01:51:03.309 --> 01:51:05.539
Try the wine.

01:51:11.949 --> 01:51:13.289
Thank you, sir.

01:51:15.888 --> 01:51:17.148
Cheers.

01:51:19.198 --> 01:51:20.388
Happy days.

01:51:30.907 --> 01:51:33.237
Won't you join me?

01:51:33.977 --> 01:51:36.167
My health doesn't allow it.

01:51:37.007 --> 01:51:38.337
No, thank you.

01:51:44.317 --> 01:51:46.806
"1960, Chateau

01:51:47.316 --> 01:51:49.216
Saint-Estephe.

01:51:49.486 --> 01:51:50.316
Medoc"

01:51:50.556 --> 01:51:51.526
Very good brand.

01:52:00.236 --> 01:52:01.256
Very good

01:52:01.535 --> 01:52:02.725
color, sir.

01:52:06.935 --> 01:52:08.705
Smells nice too.

01:52:23.584 --> 01:52:25.614
Very nice little number.

01:52:26.854 --> 01:52:28.184
Here's to it.

01:52:36.933 --> 01:52:39.423
Very refreshing, sir.
Very refreshing.

01:52:39.703 --> 01:52:42.603
I'm pleased you
appreciate good wine.

01:52:43.743 --> 01:52:45.603
Have another glass.

01:52:58.782 --> 01:53:00.122
My wife

01:53:01.592 --> 01:53:05.111
used to do everything for me
and leave me to my writing.

01:53:08.061 --> 01:53:09.651
Your wife? Is she away?

01:53:10.101 --> 01:53:12.431
She's dead!

01:53:16.501 --> 01:53:18.330
I'm sorry to hear about that.

01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:20.970
She was very badly raped, you see.

01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:23.640
We were assaulted by
vicious young hoodlums

01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:26.240
in this very room
you're sitting in now.

01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:31.180
I was left a helpless cripple,
but for her the agony was too great.

01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:33.420
The doctors said
it was pneumonia

01:53:33.649 --> 01:53:36.489
because it happened later,
during a flu epidemic.

01:53:36.759 --> 01:53:40.989
The doctors told me it was
pneumonia, but I knew what it was.

01:53:41.259 --> 01:53:45.629
A victim of the modern age.
Poor, poor girl!

01:53:49.598 --> 01:53:51.158
And now you.

01:53:51.768 --> 01:53:54.828
Another victim of the modern age.

01:53:55.138 --> 01:53:57.038
But you can be helped.

01:53:58.108 --> 01:54:01.508
I phoned some friends while
you were having your bath.

01:54:01.778 --> 01:54:02.608
Some

01:54:02.848 --> 01:54:03.938
friends?

01:54:04.177 --> 01:54:05.707
They want to help you.

01:54:05.987 --> 01:54:08.217
- Help me?
- Help you.

01:54:08.487 --> 01:54:11.977
- Who are they?
- Very, very important people.

01:54:12.217 --> 01:54:14.617
And they're interested in you.

01:54:20.126 --> 01:54:22.286
This'll be these people now.

01:54:22.496 --> 01:54:25.896
I don't want to trouble you
any further. I should be leaving.

01:54:27.006 --> 01:54:28.966
No trouble at all.

01:54:29.676 --> 01:54:30.866
Here.

01:54:31.106 --> 01:54:33.006
Let me fill your glass.

01:54:58.734 --> 01:55:00.464
So this is the young man.

01:55:01.864 --> 01:55:03.304
How do you do, sir?

01:55:03.674 --> 01:55:06.293
Missus.
I'm very pleased to meet you.

01:55:06.703 --> 01:55:09.173
I hope you forgive us for coming
at this hour

01:55:09.413 --> 01:55:11.243
but we heard you
were in trouble

01:55:11.543 --> 01:55:13.803
and so we came over to see
if we could help.

01:55:14.083 --> 01:55:16.343
Very kind of you, sir.
Thank you very much.

01:55:16.553 --> 01:55:18.813
I understand you had a rather

01:55:19.053 --> 01:55:20.313
unfortunate

01:55:20.553 --> 01:55:22.042
encounter

01:55:22.322 --> 01:55:24.052
with the police tonight.

01:55:24.322 --> 01:55:26.382
Yes, I suppose
you could call it that.

01:55:26.662 --> 01:55:27.922
How are you feeling now?

01:55:28.222 --> 01:55:29.492
Much better, thank you.

01:55:29.732 --> 01:55:32.092
Feel like talking,
answering a few questions?

01:55:32.362 --> 01:55:33.692
Fine, sir. Fine.

01:55:34.532 --> 01:55:37.191
As I said, we've heard about you.

01:55:37.701 --> 01:55:40.361
We are interested in your case.

01:55:40.571 --> 01:55:43.501
- We want to help you.
- Thank you very much.

01:55:43.741 --> 01:55:46.871
Shall we get down to it?

01:55:47.111 --> 01:55:48.911
Fine. Fine, sir.

01:55:54.220 --> 01:55:57.010
The newspapers mentioned

01:55:57.220 --> 01:56:01.520
in addition to being conditioned
against acts of sex and violence

01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:05.120
you've inadvertently been
conditioned against music.

01:56:06.130 --> 01:56:09.189
I think that was something
that they didn't plan for.

01:56:09.569 --> 01:56:11.469
You see, missus

01:56:11.729 --> 01:56:15.189
I’m very fond of music.
Especially Beethoven.

01:56:16.309 --> 01:56:18.269
Ludwig van Beethoven.

01:56:18.539 --> 01:56:20.869
- B-E...
- It's all right, thank you.

01:56:21.379 --> 01:56:25.438
And it just so happened that
while they were showing me

01:56:25.708 --> 01:56:29.618
a particularly bad film
of, like, a concentration camp

01:56:29.888 --> 01:56:33.448
the background music
was playing Beethoven.

01:56:33.658 --> 01:56:36.418
So now you have
the same reaction to music

01:56:36.658 --> 01:56:38.417
as you do to sex and violence?

01:56:38.657 --> 01:56:42.987
No, missus. You see, it's not
all music. It's just the Ninth.

01:56:43.227 --> 01:56:44.997
You mean Beethoven's Ninth Symphony?

01:56:45.227 --> 01:56:48.257
That's right. I can't listen
to the Ninth anymore at all.

01:56:48.497 --> 01:56:51.957
When I hear the Ninth, I get, like

01:56:52.267 --> 01:56:53.826
this funny feeling.

01:56:54.906 --> 01:56:59.176
And then all I can think about
is, like, trying to snuff it.

01:56:59.476 --> 01:57:03.846
- I beg your pardon?
- Snuff it. Death, I mean.

01:57:04.116 --> 01:57:06.676
I just want to die peacefully

01:57:07.156 --> 01:57:09.485
like, with no pain.

01:57:10.255 --> 01:57:12.155
Do you feel that way now?

01:57:13.295 --> 01:57:15.285
No, sir, not exactly.

01:57:15.495 --> 01:57:16.755
I still feel

01:57:16.995 --> 01:57:18.295
very miserable.

01:57:18.495 --> 01:57:21.025
Very much down in spirits.

01:57:21.595 --> 01:57:22.865
Do you still feel

01:57:23.135 --> 01:57:24.624
suicidal?

01:57:27.874 --> 01:57:29.664
Put it this way:

01:57:29.944 --> 01:57:32.774
I feel very low in myself.

01:57:33.614 --> 01:57:35.944
I can't see much in the future.

01:57:36.184 --> 01:57:40.643
I feel that any second, something
terrible is going to happen to me.

01:57:53.893 --> 01:57:55.552
Well done, Frank.

01:58:01.572 --> 01:58:03.362
Get the car, would you, please?

01:58:23.991 --> 01:58:25.350
I woke up

01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:34.660
the pain and sickness
all over me like an animal.

01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:45.579
Then I realized what it was.

01:58:46.849 --> 01:58:49.609
The music coming up
from the floor

01:58:49.879 --> 01:58:53.079
was our old friend,
Ludwig van

01:58:53.349 --> 01:58:55.948
and the dreaded Ninth Symphony.

01:59:03.898 --> 01:59:05.258
Let me out!

01:59:05.528 --> 01:59:07.258
Open the door!

01:59:07.968 --> 01:59:10.128
Come on, open the door!

01:59:12.697 --> 01:59:13.967
Turn it off!

01:59:14.207 --> 01:59:15.967
Turn it off!

01:59:22.917 --> 01:59:23.807
Stop it!

02:00:12.094 --> 02:00:13.583
Turn it off!

02:00:15.023 --> 02:00:15.993
Please!

02:00:16.263 --> 02:00:18.453
Turn it off!

02:00:32.372 --> 02:00:35.282
Suddenly, I viddied
what I had to do

02:00:35.512 --> 02:00:37.812
and what I had wanted to do.

02:00:38.212 --> 02:00:40.682
And that was to do myself in.

02:00:41.052 --> 02:00:42.482
To snuff it.

02:00:42.822 --> 02:00:46.151
To blast off forever,
out of this wicked, cruel world.

02:00:47.791 --> 02:00:50.161
One moment of pain, perhaps

02:00:50.461 --> 02:00:52.221
and then sleep.

02:00:52.491 --> 02:00:55.021
Forever and ever

02:00:55.301 --> 02:00:56.561
and ever.

02:01:21.059 --> 02:01:22.819
I jumped, O my brothers

02:01:23.089 --> 02:01:24.519
and I fell hard.

02:01:24.759 --> 02:01:27.059
But I did not snuff it.

02:01:27.659 --> 02:01:29.258
If I had snuffed it

02:01:29.528 --> 02:01:32.858
I would not be here
to tell what I told have.

02:01:34.738 --> 02:01:39.368
I came back to life
after a long, black, black gap

02:01:39.608 --> 02:01:42.908
of what might have been
a million years.

02:02:11.636 --> 02:02:14.196
He's recovered
consciousness, Doctor.

02:02:54.273 --> 02:02:55.803
Hello, lad.

02:02:56.073 --> 02:02:57.603
Hello, son.

02:02:58.583 --> 02:03:00.013
How are you?

02:03:01.182 --> 02:03:03.172
You feeling better?

02:03:07.622 --> 02:03:08.682
What

02:03:08.922 --> 02:03:09.942
gives

02:03:11.422 --> 02:03:13.412
O my Pee and Em?

02:03:14.332 --> 02:03:15.882
What makes

02:03:16.661 --> 02:03:17.561
you think

02:03:17.861 --> 02:03:20.261
you are welcome?

02:03:23.241 --> 02:03:25.201
There, there, Mother.
It's all right.

02:03:25.401 --> 02:03:27.061
He doesn't mean it.

02:03:29.541 --> 02:03:32.030
You were in the papers again, son.

02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:34.400
It said

02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:37.380
they had done
great wrong to you.

02:03:38.250 --> 02:03:39.580
It said

02:03:39.890 --> 02:03:41.180
how the government

02:03:41.420 --> 02:03:43.410
drove you to try

02:03:43.690 --> 02:03:45.250
and do yourself in.

02:03:47.090 --> 02:03:49.359
And when you think about it, son

02:03:50.429 --> 02:03:53.089
maybe it was our fault too

02:03:53.469 --> 02:03:54.689
in a way.

02:03:55.799 --> 02:03:57.699
Your home's your home

02:03:58.069 --> 02:04:00.589
when all's said and done, son.

02:04:10.578 --> 02:04:13.108
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Doctor.

02:04:22.057 --> 02:04:24.287
- How are you feeling today?
- Fine.

02:04:24.597 --> 02:04:25.647
Good. May I?

02:04:26.097 --> 02:04:28.117
- I'm Dr. Taylor.
- Haven't seen you before.

02:04:28.397 --> 02:04:29.657
I'm your psychiatrist.

02:04:29.967 --> 02:04:31.827
Psychiatrist!
Do I need one?

02:04:32.097 --> 02:04:33.566
Just part of hospital routine.

02:04:33.806 --> 02:04:35.966
Are we going to
talk about me sex life?

02:04:37.636 --> 02:04:39.626
I'm going to show you
some slides

02:04:39.906 --> 02:04:42.736
and you're going to tell me
what you think about them.

02:04:43.646 --> 02:04:44.576
Jolly good.

02:04:46.686 --> 02:04:48.236
You know anything about dreams?

02:04:48.685 --> 02:04:49.805
Something, yes.

02:04:50.015 --> 02:04:51.775
- You know what they mean?
- Perhaps.

02:04:51.985 --> 02:04:53.455
You concerned about something?

02:04:53.825 --> 02:04:56.815
No, not concerned, really

02:04:57.095 --> 02:04:59.085
but I've been having
this nasty dream.

02:04:59.325 --> 02:05:00.795
Very nasty.

02:05:01.065 --> 02:05:02.965
It's like

02:05:04.964 --> 02:05:07.124
when I was all smashed up,
you know

02:05:07.434 --> 02:05:09.454
and half-awake
and unconscious-like

02:05:09.734 --> 02:05:11.794
I kept having this dream.

02:05:12.074 --> 02:05:14.974
All these doctors were
playing around with me gulliver.

02:05:15.174 --> 02:05:17.264
You know, like the inside
of me brain.

02:05:17.514 --> 02:05:20.413
I seem to have this dream
over and over again.

02:05:20.643 --> 02:05:22.773
Do you think it means anything?

02:05:23.683 --> 02:05:28.123
Patients with injuries like yours
often have dreams of this sort.

02:05:28.353 --> 02:05:30.443
It's all part
of the recovery process.

02:05:31.693 --> 02:05:34.483
Now then, each of these slides
needs a reply

02:05:34.792 --> 02:05:36.782
from one of the people
in the picture.

02:05:36.992 --> 02:05:40.192
You tell me what you think
the person would say

02:05:40.462 --> 02:05:41.332
all right?

02:05:41.602 --> 02:05:43.032
Righty-right.

02:05:45.002 --> 02:05:47.372
"Isn't the plumage beautiful?"

02:05:48.642 --> 02:05:51.111
I just say what the
other person would say?

02:05:55.281 --> 02:05:56.801
Don't think about it too long.

02:05:57.051 --> 02:05:59.571
Say the first thing
that pops into your mind.

02:06:02.221 --> 02:06:04.621
Cabbages. Knickers.

02:06:05.790 --> 02:06:08.120
It's not got a beak.

02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:09.620
Good.

02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:17.200
"The boy you always quarreled with
is seriously ill"

02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:19.900
My mind is a blank

02:06:20.969 --> 02:06:24.869
and I'll smash your face
for you, yarblockos.

02:06:25.139 --> 02:06:26.129
Good.

02:06:28.739 --> 02:06:30.839
"What do you want?"

02:06:31.909 --> 02:06:35.249
No time for the old in-out, love.
I've just come to read the meter.

02:06:35.679 --> 02:06:37.048
Good.

02:06:40.518 --> 02:06:44.008
"You sold me a crummy watch.
I want my money back"

02:06:44.528 --> 02:06:47.758
You know what you can do with
that watch? Stick it up your ass!

02:06:52.097 --> 02:06:54.797
"You can do whatever
you like with these"

02:06:56.397 --> 02:06:58.197
Eggiwegs.

02:06:58.737 --> 02:07:00.667
I would like

02:07:00.907 --> 02:07:02.237
to smash them.

02:07:03.037 --> 02:07:04.337
And pick them all up

02:07:04.547 --> 02:07:06.207
and throw

02:07:06.447 --> 02:07:07.876
Fucking hell!

02:07:08.746 --> 02:07:11.076
There. That's all there is to it.

02:07:11.746 --> 02:07:13.236
Are you all right?

02:07:14.116 --> 02:07:15.516
Hope so.

02:07:15.686 --> 02:07:18.716
Is that the end, then?
I was quite enjoying that.

02:07:19.026 --> 02:07:20.316
Good. I'm glad.

02:07:20.626 --> 02:07:21.716
How many did I get right?

02:07:22.025 --> 02:07:23.785
It's not that kind of a test.

02:07:24.065 --> 02:07:27.355
But you seem well on the way
to making a complete recovery.

02:07:28.035 --> 02:07:29.395
When do I get out, then?

02:07:29.665 --> 02:07:32.295
I'm sure it won't be long now.

02:07:33.675 --> 02:07:35.225
So I waited

02:07:35.535 --> 02:07:37.005
and, O my brothers

02:07:37.444 --> 02:07:38.804
I got a lot better

02:07:39.044 --> 02:07:42.304
munching away at eggiwegs
and lomticks of toast

02:07:42.544 --> 02:07:45.014
and lovely steakie-wakes.

02:07:45.214 --> 02:07:46.704
And then one day

02:07:46.984 --> 02:07:51.074
they said I was going to have
a very special visitor.

02:07:56.523 --> 02:07:59.223
Just wait outside for a moment,
would you, Officer?

02:08:02.333 --> 02:08:04.493
I'm afraid my change of schedule
has thrown you.

02:08:04.763 --> 02:08:06.993
The patient's in the middle
of supper.

02:08:07.233 --> 02:08:10.072
That's quite all right, Minister.
No trouble at all.

02:08:11.542 --> 02:08:14.532
- Good evening, my boy.
- Hi there, my little droogies.

02:08:14.772 --> 02:08:16.572
How are you getting on, young man?

02:08:16.942 --> 02:08:19.172
Great, sir. Just great.

02:08:19.942 --> 02:08:21.542
Can I do anything more for you?

02:08:21.752 --> 02:08:23.541
I don't think so, Sir Leslie.

02:08:23.751 --> 02:08:26.411
Then I leave you to it.
Nurse!

02:08:29.251 --> 02:08:32.521
You seem to have a whole ward
to yourself, my boy.

02:08:32.791 --> 02:08:34.021
Yes, sir.

02:08:34.591 --> 02:08:36.961
And a very lonely place
it is too

02:08:37.201 --> 02:08:39.560
when I wake up in the night
with me pain.

02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:43.260
Anyway, good to see you
on the mend.

02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:46.130
I kept in touch
with the hospital, of course.

02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:48.200
And now I've come down
personally

02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:50.030
to see how you're getting along.

02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:52.770
I've suffered the tortures
of the damned.

02:08:52.980 --> 02:08:54.469
Tortures of the damned.

02:08:54.779 --> 02:08:57.809
Yes, I can appreciate that
you've had an extremely

02:08:58.049 --> 02:09:00.809
Oh, look. Let me help you
with that, shall I?

02:09:03.049 --> 02:09:07.249
I can tell you that I, and the
government of which I'm a member

02:09:07.489 --> 02:09:11.448
are deeply sorry about this,
my boy. Deeply sorry.

02:09:11.658 --> 02:09:12.928
We tried to help you.

02:09:13.158 --> 02:09:17.258
We followed recommendations
that turned out to be wrong.

02:09:17.668 --> 02:09:21.498
An inquiry will place the
responsibility where it belongs.

02:09:22.168 --> 02:09:25.397
We want you to regard us
as friends.

02:09:25.637 --> 02:09:26.907
We put you right.

02:09:27.307 --> 02:09:29.247
You're getting
the best of treatment.

02:09:29.447 --> 02:09:31.677
We never wished you harm.

02:09:31.977 --> 02:09:34.647
But there are some who did, and do.

02:09:35.147 --> 02:09:37.817
And I think you know who those are.

02:09:38.417 --> 02:09:42.186
There are certain people who wanted
to use you for political ends.

02:09:42.456 --> 02:09:44.826
They would have been
glad to have you dead

02:09:45.026 --> 02:09:48.186
for they thought they could then
blame it on the government.

02:09:48.826 --> 02:09:51.166
There is also a certain man

02:09:51.366 --> 02:09:53.856
a writer of subversive
literature

02:09:54.166 --> 02:09:56.265
who has been howling
for your blood.

02:09:56.465 --> 02:09:59.875
He's been mad with desire
to stick a knife into you.

02:10:00.345 --> 02:10:01.835
But you're safe from him now.

02:10:02.105 --> 02:10:04.135
We put him away.

02:10:06.045 --> 02:10:09.135
He found out that you
had done wrong to him.

02:10:09.715 --> 02:10:12.114
At least he believed
you had done wrong.

02:10:12.384 --> 02:10:16.614
He formed this idea in his head
that you had been responsible

02:10:16.894 --> 02:10:20.324
for the death of someone
near and dear to him.

02:10:21.164 --> 02:10:22.284
He was a menace.

02:10:22.494 --> 02:10:24.624
We put him away
for his own protection.

02:10:24.834 --> 02:10:26.193
And also for yours.

02:10:26.963 --> 02:10:28.333
Where is he now?

02:10:28.563 --> 02:10:32.023
We put him away
where he can do you no harm.

02:10:32.303 --> 02:10:35.363
You see, we are looking
after your interests.

02:10:35.673 --> 02:10:37.703
We are interested in you.

02:10:38.473 --> 02:10:41.532
When you leave, you'll have no
worries. We'll see to everything.

02:10:41.782 --> 02:10:43.902
A good job on a good salary.

02:10:44.152 --> 02:10:45.872
What job and how much?

02:10:46.752 --> 02:10:50.712
You'll have an interesting job at
a salary you regard as adequate.

02:10:50.952 --> 02:10:53.152
Not only for the job
you're going to do

02:10:53.422 --> 02:10:57.051
and in compensation for what
you believe you have suffered

02:10:57.291 --> 02:11:00.961
but also because
you are helping us.

02:11:02.161 --> 02:11:03.761
Helping you?

02:11:04.001 --> 02:11:07.161
We always help our friends,
don't we?

02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:15.910
It is no secret
that this government

02:11:16.140 --> 02:11:19.310
has lost a lot of popularity
because of you, my boy.

02:11:19.580 --> 02:11:22.980
There are some who think that at
the next election we shall be out.

02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:25.950
The press has chosen to take
a very unfavorable view

02:11:26.150 --> 02:11:27.589
of what we tried to do.

02:11:28.519 --> 02:11:31.819
But public opinion
has a way of changing.

02:11:32.089 --> 02:11:33.789
And you, Alex

02:11:34.029 --> 02:11:35.859
if I may call you Alex.

02:11:36.129 --> 02:11:39.429
Certainly.
What do they call you at home?

02:11:40.769 --> 02:11:42.029
My name is Frederick.

02:11:42.998 --> 02:11:44.838
As I was saying, Alex

02:11:45.108 --> 02:11:50.008
you can be instrumental
in changing the public's verdict.

02:11:53.308 --> 02:11:55.338
Do you understand, Alex?

02:11:56.218 --> 02:11:58.477
Do I make myself clear?

02:12:01.387 --> 02:12:03.687
As an unmuddied lake, Fred.

02:12:04.227 --> 02:12:07.627
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

02:12:07.857 --> 02:12:09.297
You can rely on me, Fred.

02:12:09.527 --> 02:12:10.857
Good.

02:12:11.127 --> 02:12:12.567
Good boy.

02:12:13.636 --> 02:12:15.466
I understand you're fond of music.

02:12:15.736 --> 02:12:17.896
I have arranged a little
surprise for you.

02:12:18.206 --> 02:12:19.636
Surprise?

02:12:19.866 --> 02:12:21.566
One that I hope
that you will like

02:12:21.836 --> 02:12:23.236
as a

02:12:24.046 --> 02:12:25.406
how shall we put it

02:12:25.646 --> 02:12:28.875
as a symbol of
our new understanding.

02:12:29.875 --> 02:12:33.175
An understanding
between two friends.

02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:55.850
was cured, all right!
