WEBVTT

00:04.640 --> 00:06.575
Sorry we're late.

00:06.577 --> 00:08.243
We were at gigantic's
getting a gigantic

00:08.245 --> 00:10.579
pair of scissors for the
ribbon cutting ceremony.

00:10.581 --> 00:12.214
Why are they covered in mustard?

00:12.216 --> 00:14.182
We also split a
gigantic hot dog.

00:14.184 --> 00:16.618
Now I have a gigantic
stomachache.

00:16.620 --> 00:17.554
Guys.

00:17.585 --> 00:21.289
The grand opening of the A&A music
factory isn't until next week.

00:21.291 --> 00:23.792
Today's just a preview for some
reporters to generate buzz.

00:23.794 --> 00:25.961
Aw, so I don't get
to cut anything?

00:25.963 --> 00:29.264
You can cut this tiny thread off my
shirt, it's been bugging me all day.

00:29.266 --> 00:30.332
Pfft, oh.

00:31.534 --> 00:33.301
Oh, did you get it?

00:33.303 --> 00:34.870
Uh...

00:34.872 --> 00:36.371
Yeah, I think so.

00:39.709 --> 00:43.378
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
we are very excited to welcome you

00:43.380 --> 00:45.981
to a sneak peak of the
A&A music factory.

00:45.983 --> 00:49.851
As you can see, we've built a
state of the art music academy.

00:49.853 --> 00:52.254
We have every instrument
a kid could dream of

00:52.256 --> 00:53.989
on our one of a kind
music carousel.

00:56.926 --> 00:59.327
A professional recording booth.

00:59.329 --> 01:02.330
A stage for performing,
another stage

01:02.332 --> 01:04.399
complete with virtual
concert simulator goggles.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.901
Thank you, Miami!

01:05.903 --> 01:07.602
Oh!

01:07.604 --> 01:09.571
Man, this thing is awesome.

01:09.573 --> 01:11.606
It lets you perform
anywhere on earth.

01:11.608 --> 01:13.975
Or anywhere not on earth.

01:13.977 --> 01:16.545
Thank you, planet Zytrax!

01:16.547 --> 01:17.946
Boom! Oh, no.

01:17.948 --> 01:19.648
Incoming asteroid.

01:23.352 --> 01:24.986
Moving right along.

01:25.922 --> 01:29.291
Our goal at the A&A music factory
is to spread the joy of music.

01:29.293 --> 01:31.928
And that's something you
can't put a price tag on.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.929
But to be clear, there
is a price tag.

01:33.931 --> 01:36.031
300 bucks, cash only.

01:37.567 --> 01:41.870
Beverly Robbins, senior editor,
Miami Daily Star Gazette.

01:41.872 --> 01:44.372
So, what was your motivation
for the redesign?

01:44.374 --> 01:47.375
Well... It was important
for us to create

01:47.377 --> 01:49.044
a nurturing environment
for our young students.

01:49.046 --> 01:52.514
So they can learn music in a
comfortable, safe setting.

01:52.516 --> 01:53.815
No one is safe!

01:53.817 --> 01:55.317
We're being attacked by aliens!

01:57.554 --> 01:59.888
Stop! You're in virtual reality!

01:59.890 --> 02:01.056
Huh?

02:01.058 --> 02:03.058
Oh. Whoo! That's a relief.

02:04.360 --> 02:05.427
What's that?

02:10.532 --> 02:12.033
I think this belongs to you.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:07.957 --> 03:10.392
The A&A music factory has
something for everyone.

03:10.394 --> 03:14.201
We can teach you how to dance, how to
write songs, how to make music videos.

03:14.232 --> 03:17.999
Beverly Robbins, senior editor
at Miami Daily Star Gazette.

03:18.001 --> 03:21.836
I hate to sound negative, but this
just sounds like a couple of pop stars

03:21.838 --> 03:24.105
exploiting their fame
for a quick buck.

03:24.107 --> 03:27.876
Wow, for someone who hates to sound
negative, you are good at it.

03:28.945 --> 03:33.715
We get your skepticism, Ms. Robbins,
but we take this very seriously.

03:33.717 --> 03:37.018
Yep, give Austin and Ally a week, and
they can turn anyone into a musician.

03:37.020 --> 03:38.954
Well, I don't know
about just a week.

03:38.956 --> 03:39.543
Yeah!

03:39.574 --> 03:41.890
Even if a kid has never
touched an instrument,

03:41.892 --> 03:43.458
they'll walk out of here a pro.

03:43.460 --> 03:46.094
Um, I mean it would help if
they had some experience.

03:46.096 --> 03:49.998
Ah, Beverly Robbins, senior
editor, Miami Daily Star Gazette.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.935
So you're saying you can take a
child, and turn them into a musician

03:53.937 --> 03:55.003
in one week?

03:55.938 --> 03:56.558
Well...

03:56.589 --> 03:59.040
If that's what you
recorded us saying

03:59.042 --> 04:00.709
then I guess that's
what we said.

04:00.711 --> 04:02.410
Then prove it.

04:02.412 --> 04:06.781
Teach a group of amateurs a song to
perform at your grand opening next week.

04:06.783 --> 04:08.750
Oh, come on.

04:08.752 --> 04:11.453
That just sounds like some publicity
stunt to generate attention

04:11.455 --> 04:13.021
for our new music school.

04:13.956 --> 04:15.056
Wait!

04:15.058 --> 04:16.858
That sounds like a
big publicity stunt

04:16.860 --> 04:19.494
to generate attention for
our new music school!

04:19.495 --> 04:20.528
We're in!

04:20.529 --> 04:21.630
Um...

04:21.632 --> 04:22.998
Excuse us.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.734
Trish, what are you doing?

04:25.736 --> 04:27.469
We want to make
headlines, right?

04:27.471 --> 04:28.503
This is our chance!

04:28.505 --> 04:29.537
Yeah.

04:29.539 --> 04:31.006
Our chance to
embarrass ourselves.

04:31.008 --> 04:35.076
Hey, if anybody can put a band
together in a week, it's you guys.

04:35.705 --> 04:37.145
Okay, if you're
trying to flatter us

04:37.147 --> 04:40.615
into going along with
this, it's working.

04:40.617 --> 04:42.183
Yeah, we are pretty
awesome, aren't we?

04:42.185 --> 04:44.586
Yes! We're making a band!

04:44.588 --> 04:45.175
Great!

04:45.206 --> 04:47.522
My son, Max, can be
your first member.

04:47.524 --> 04:48.590
Max.

04:49.892 --> 04:51.026
Oh.

04:51.028 --> 04:52.049
Wow.

04:52.080 --> 04:56.161
Watching a student embark on his first
musical journey really warms my heart.

04:57.199 --> 04:58.767
I hate music.

05:00.202 --> 05:01.202
And that breaks it.

05:02.672 --> 05:03.705
- Oh.
- Give me it!

05:03.707 --> 05:04.739
Oh.

05:04.741 --> 05:06.875
Kids, right?

05:09.011 --> 05:12.013
Welcome to step one of operation
make a band in a week

05:12.015 --> 05:15.216
from a bunch of newbies to impress
the media on our grand opening.

05:16.252 --> 05:18.413
Maybe step one should be
coming up with a shorter name.

05:19.155 --> 05:21.756
Wait, where's Dez?

05:21.758 --> 05:24.592
I thought we all were supposed to
find a new student to join our band.

05:25.728 --> 05:26.688
Hello, strangers.

05:26.719 --> 05:29.230
I'm just a kid with
no musical talent.

05:29.232 --> 05:32.701
Dez sent me here to join the
A&A music factory band.

05:33.823 --> 05:35.103
So you couldn't find a kid, Dez?

05:35.105 --> 05:36.171
No, I could not.

05:37.722 --> 05:38.442
Well, that's okay.

05:38.472 --> 05:41.076
The three of us found
students and Max makes four.

05:41.078 --> 05:44.112
Let's just hope the other kids have
a little more enthusiasm than Max.

05:44.114 --> 05:46.715
Maybe Max just hasn't found
the right instrument.

05:46.717 --> 05:48.237
What do you want to
play, little dude?

05:49.085 --> 05:51.119
Right now, I want to
play Zombie Shredder.

05:51.121 --> 05:52.787
Oh, I love that game.

05:52.789 --> 05:55.256
I hate to brag, but I
made it to level six.

05:55.258 --> 05:57.792
- I'm on level six...
- Oh.

05:57.794 --> 05:59.127
Hundred and twelve.

06:00.129 --> 06:01.096
Nobody likes a show off.

06:01.098 --> 06:03.932
All right, well I brought Lily.

06:03.934 --> 06:05.900
She started piano
lessons here last week.

06:05.902 --> 06:07.035
I'm super pumped!

06:07.037 --> 06:08.970
I've been practicing nonstop.

06:12.975 --> 06:14.975
Were the lights on or off
when you were practicing?

06:16.579 --> 06:17.612
This is Dylan.

06:17.614 --> 06:18.980
I met her at the skate park.

06:18.982 --> 06:19.749
'Sup?

06:19.780 --> 06:22.817
Well, welcome to the A&A
music factory, Dylan.

06:22.819 --> 06:26.855
Oh my gosh! I can't believe I'm
actually talking to Ally Dawson!

06:26.857 --> 06:31.092
Who I've never heard of because
I don't listen to pop music.

06:32.595 --> 06:36.131
So if you don't like pop music, then
why do you want to join our school?

06:36.133 --> 06:38.666
This Austin guy just
kept bugging me. Pfft.

06:38.668 --> 06:41.903
You came up to me and asked me to
autograph everything in your backpack.

06:41.905 --> 06:44.906
I was just making sure
all my pens worked.

06:44.908 --> 06:47.742
Psh, I don't think
you're gorgeous.

06:49.773 --> 06:50.373
This is Herman.

06:50.403 --> 06:52.614
He's on my little
brother's baseball team.

06:52.616 --> 06:54.115
I really want to go
back to my game.

06:54.117 --> 06:56.017
I don't think I I'm
any good at music.

06:56.019 --> 06:58.219
I just watched you
at batting practice.

06:58.221 --> 07:00.688
Trust me, you're not any
good at baseball either.

07:01.891 --> 07:04.726
No good? I struck out
ten times last game.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.327
My coach said that's a record!

07:07.329 --> 07:10.231
Look, Herman, you may not
be good at music now,

07:10.233 --> 07:12.867
but you'll be a rockstar
by the end of the week.

07:12.869 --> 07:14.068
You all will!

07:14.070 --> 07:17.138
The first thing we need to do is
find you instruments to play.

07:18.207 --> 07:20.975
You know, Max, since you've
got such quick fingers,

07:20.977 --> 07:22.777
I thought you'd be
great at the keyboard.

07:22.779 --> 07:23.646
Sick!

07:23.677 --> 07:27.115
Yeah, I guess playing the
keyboard is pretty...

07:27.117 --> 07:27.877
Sick!

07:27.908 --> 07:30.949
I just threw a zombie
head into a wood chipper.

07:32.721 --> 07:33.788
That is also sick.

07:35.891 --> 07:37.826
Can you at least try
playing the keyboard?

07:37.828 --> 07:38.860
Sure.

07:41.064 --> 07:43.832
Well, it's a start.

07:45.067 --> 07:46.100
All right, Herman.

07:46.102 --> 07:47.168
Show us what you got.

07:52.742 --> 07:54.309
Hey, I'm pretty good.

07:55.244 --> 07:57.312
We should have been more clear.

07:58.314 --> 08:00.682
When you play the
drums, the key is to...

08:01.985 --> 08:03.351
Hit the drums.

08:07.223 --> 08:09.090
Hey!

08:13.062 --> 08:14.829
Well, at least you
hit something.

08:23.599 --> 08:25.440
You know what, maybe the
keyboard isn't for me.

08:25.442 --> 08:27.709
- But you're so talented.
- Oh, thank goodness.

08:28.978 --> 08:30.044
How about this?

08:35.118 --> 08:37.986
Oh, here. Let me show
you how to hold that.

08:39.922 --> 08:40.989
Oopsie.

08:40.991 --> 08:42.056
It broke.

08:44.126 --> 08:45.994
Ooh, can I try the giant guitar?

08:45.996 --> 08:46.686
Oh, are you sure?

08:46.717 --> 08:49.193
The upright bass is kind
of a big instrument.

08:52.067 --> 08:54.102
Am I playing bass yet?

08:56.305 --> 08:59.140
So Dylan, what do you think
about playing guitar?

08:59.142 --> 09:00.508
Or the air guitar.

09:04.313 --> 09:05.380
Aw.

09:06.916 --> 09:07.949
Guitar could be fun.

09:07.951 --> 09:12.020
Something cute and glittery like the one
Ally played on her "Finally Me" tour.

09:12.022 --> 09:13.354
Or... whatever.

09:14.290 --> 09:16.224
Here, this is the
exact one she used.

09:17.426 --> 09:20.028
Well, I guess if this is
the only one you have.

09:20.030 --> 09:21.262
All right.

09:21.264 --> 09:23.264
Let's start with
some simple chords.

09:23.266 --> 09:24.299
This is "D."

09:30.173 --> 09:32.106
Cool, you picked that up quick.

09:32.108 --> 09:33.808
This is fun.

09:33.810 --> 09:36.244
You'll be a pop
princess in no time.

09:37.780 --> 09:39.113
Pop princess?

09:40.115 --> 09:41.089
Uh, you know what?

09:41.120 --> 09:44.986
I just remembered, I gotta go meet
my friends at the skate park. So...

09:44.988 --> 09:46.220
Catch you later.

09:48.123 --> 09:49.958
That was weird.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.121
She said she was having fun,
and then she just ran out.

09:54.170 --> 09:56.130
Oh, I'm sorry, what was that?
I couldn't hear you.

09:56.132 --> 09:58.232
I was too busy jamming out
on my air tambourine.

09:58.234 --> 10:02.070
I'd rather be playing my air guitar,
but someone took it away from me.

10:09.545 --> 10:10.841
This band has got to be good.

10:10.872 --> 10:14.148
We can't ruin our music school's
reputation before it even opens.

10:14.150 --> 10:15.516
It's gonna be awesome.

10:15.518 --> 10:17.552
We've been working with
them one on one for days.

10:17.554 --> 10:19.387
Now it's just a matter of
having them play together.

10:19.389 --> 10:22.156
All right, let's
destroy this song.

10:36.338 --> 10:38.439
Well, they're definitely
destroying the song.

10:38.441 --> 10:39.941
This is a disaster.

10:39.943 --> 10:41.542
I have one word for that mess.

10:41.544 --> 10:42.577
Yikes.

10:42.579 --> 10:44.145
I've got 22 words for this mess.

10:44.147 --> 10:46.180
There's no way they'll be able
to play the grand opening

10:46.182 --> 10:48.463
this weekend because they were
really, really, really bad.

10:49.985 --> 10:51.352
Really.

10:51.354 --> 10:53.888
The press is gonna
rip us to shreds.

10:53.890 --> 10:55.089
Maybe we should
postpone the opening.

10:55.091 --> 10:57.025
That'll look just as bad.

10:57.027 --> 10:58.259
We need a plan "b."

10:58.261 --> 10:59.460
Guys, come on.

10:59.462 --> 11:02.463
We're not postponing it,
and there's no plan "b."

11:02.465 --> 11:04.132
We can't give up.

11:04.134 --> 11:06.000
Maybe they're not good today.

11:06.002 --> 11:08.136
And maybe they won't
be good tomorrow.

11:08.138 --> 11:09.937
Or the next day.

11:09.939 --> 11:12.073
But I believe in us.

11:12.075 --> 11:16.144
And if we promised to turn this rag
tag bunch of rookies into a band,

11:16.146 --> 11:18.012
then that's what we're gonna do.

11:18.014 --> 11:19.213
Now who's with me?

11:23.019 --> 11:24.352
Yeah, we need a plan "b."

11:28.391 --> 11:28.978
Okay, guys.

11:29.009 --> 11:32.828
We heard your first performance
as a band, and wow.

11:32.830 --> 11:34.329
You guys sounded...

11:34.331 --> 11:35.864
Wow.

11:36.799 --> 11:38.680
But we thought to
ourselves, how can we

11:38.711 --> 11:42.404
take something that's already so
perfect, and make it even better?

11:42.406 --> 11:44.573
Meet your new band mates.

11:46.509 --> 11:48.176
You're replacing us?

11:48.178 --> 11:49.023
No, no, no, no, no!

11:49.054 --> 11:52.314
These guys are just here to make
your music bigger, louder...

11:52.316 --> 11:53.715
More music-like.

11:54.650 --> 11:55.951
Um, so.

11:55.953 --> 11:57.519
Let's shake things up.

11:57.521 --> 12:01.423
Dylan, we're gonna put
you on the maracas.

12:01.425 --> 12:03.825
And Lily, we're gonna put
you on the triangle.

12:03.827 --> 12:05.293
Exciting, huh?

12:05.295 --> 12:05.915
Really?

12:05.946 --> 12:08.397
You think you can hand us
a couple tiny noisemakers

12:08.399 --> 12:10.365
and we're just gonna
jump for joy?

12:10.367 --> 12:13.568
Oh! A triangle, my
favorite shape!

12:15.605 --> 12:17.472
And Max, you get to
stay on the keyboard.

12:18.508 --> 12:20.342
Whatever.

12:24.414 --> 12:25.833
What do you want me to play?

12:25.864 --> 12:28.417
You have got the most
important job of all.

12:28.419 --> 12:29.885
The finger snapper.

12:35.224 --> 12:36.792
Ha! You're a natural.

12:38.494 --> 12:39.961
He can't do anything.

12:39.963 --> 12:41.696
All set.

12:41.698 --> 12:43.331
Let's hear how you sound.

12:59.048 --> 13:00.515
Whoo!

13:01.551 --> 13:04.419
I think it's pretty obvious
what's going on here.

13:04.421 --> 13:06.555
Yeah, we're nailing it!

13:08.424 --> 13:09.098
No.

13:09.129 --> 13:11.793
They brought in pros to
drown out our sound.

13:11.795 --> 13:14.496
I mean, Max's keyboard
isn't even plugged in.

13:14.498 --> 13:16.498
And neither is my triangle.

13:18.367 --> 13:20.502
I thought we were gonna
be the rockstars.

13:20.504 --> 13:21.903
Yeah!

13:21.905 --> 13:23.772
You are!

13:23.774 --> 13:26.475
We're sorry. We just wanted
to hear how this would sound.

13:26.477 --> 13:28.977
And obviously, it
sounds terrible.

13:28.979 --> 13:31.477
You, you, and you, you
are out of the band.

13:31.508 --> 13:34.579
You don't have what it takes to
play with these unique talents.

13:35.485 --> 13:36.518
Uh...

13:36.520 --> 13:39.287
Yeah, get lost! I'm sorry...

13:39.289 --> 13:40.622
I thought you were way
better than those kids.

13:40.624 --> 13:42.357
I really don't know what's
going on right now.

13:42.359 --> 13:43.425
Bye.

13:44.427 --> 13:45.494
Ally.

13:47.296 --> 13:48.463
What are you doing?

13:48.465 --> 13:50.332
She's doing the right thing.

13:50.334 --> 13:52.734
We made a promise to these kids
that we'd turn them into a band

13:52.736 --> 13:53.935
and that's what we're gonna do.

13:53.937 --> 13:55.971
Can I still be the snapper?

13:58.808 --> 14:00.775
We have our work cut out for us.

14:04.647 --> 14:06.448
Here, Lily.

14:06.450 --> 14:09.584
I thought maybe we could try a
bass you could actually hold.

14:11.621 --> 14:14.689
Hey, I can touch the strings!

14:18.428 --> 14:19.461
O...

14:19.463 --> 14:20.562
- Hey!
- Kay.

14:21.497 --> 14:23.498
I hooked up your keyboard
to the video game

14:23.500 --> 14:25.741
and rigged it so that every
time you hit the right key...

14:26.570 --> 14:27.602
you kill a zombie.

14:27.604 --> 14:29.404
Whoa!

14:31.375 --> 14:32.440
Look at, look at, look at!

14:32.442 --> 14:33.542
Oh, get it, get it, get it!

14:33.544 --> 14:34.576
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

14:34.578 --> 14:35.710
- Sick!
- Oh!

14:35.712 --> 14:37.412
That was gross.

14:42.051 --> 14:43.084
Oh!

14:43.086 --> 14:44.586
Right, okay, time out, kid.

14:45.521 --> 14:46.842
How many fingers
am I holding up?

14:47.490 --> 14:48.523
Twelve?

14:48.525 --> 14:50.358
Yeah, you need glasses.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.394
And an anatomy lesson.

14:52.396 --> 14:53.795
Here, try these.

14:55.097 --> 14:57.132
Whoa!

14:57.134 --> 14:59.935
Who knew the world was
so clear and in focus?

15:00.870 --> 15:03.438
Ally, you have lettuce
in between your teeth.

15:13.717 --> 15:14.883
Great, Dylan.

15:14.885 --> 15:16.151
You're a natural.

15:16.153 --> 15:17.953
I have a little
surprise for you.

15:20.307 --> 15:23.024
It's the jacket Ally wore
in her "Redial" video!

15:23.026 --> 15:25.660
I thought you might want to wear it
when you perform at the grand opening.

15:25.662 --> 15:27.462
Oh my gosh, I love it!

15:30.399 --> 15:32.000
I can totally sell that online.

15:32.002 --> 15:33.068
Thanks.

15:36.405 --> 15:37.052
Whoo!

15:37.083 --> 15:39.641
Prepare to be bashed,
zombie scum!

15:39.643 --> 15:43.545
I will wipe out your legion of undead
with a beautiful C minor scale.

15:45.816 --> 15:47.616
Later, zombies.

15:48.451 --> 15:49.951
I can see everything!

15:49.953 --> 15:52.420
I bet I'm even better
at baseball now.

15:52.422 --> 15:54.055
Dez, toss me that apple.

15:56.692 --> 15:57.506
Yes!

15:57.537 --> 16:00.792
I missed it by way less
than I usually do!

16:01.897 --> 16:02.964
Stick to the drums, kid.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.534
Wow, I'm impressed.

16:06.536 --> 16:08.536
Everybody's been
sounding really good.

16:08.538 --> 16:11.573
I know! We might actually
pull this off tonight.

16:11.575 --> 16:13.441
Wait, where's Dylan?

16:13.443 --> 16:15.510
I don't know exactly
what happened

16:15.512 --> 16:17.712
but Dylan said she's quitting
because she doesn't want

16:17.714 --> 16:20.148
her skater friends to tease
her for being in a pop band.

16:20.150 --> 16:23.084
Then she got on her skateboard
and skated away real fast.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.687
So you do know exactly
what happened.

16:27.523 --> 16:28.757
Oh, yeah, I guess I do.

16:38.768 --> 16:39.462
Dylan.

16:39.493 --> 16:42.237
If you're here to
convince me to come back

16:42.239 --> 16:43.938
to the band, it's
not gonna work.

16:45.141 --> 16:45.868
Come on.

16:45.899 --> 16:48.777
It's obvious you like
being in the band.

16:48.779 --> 16:50.011
What's the deal?

16:50.946 --> 16:52.047
Well, it's just...

16:52.049 --> 16:54.015
My friends are all skaters.

16:54.017 --> 16:56.985
They would totally make fun of me if
they saw me wearing a girly jacket

16:56.987 --> 16:59.721
and playing in a pop band
with a bunch of little kids.

17:00.289 --> 17:01.463
I know how you feel.

17:01.494 --> 17:06.161
Sometimes, people walk up to me and say,
"Austin, you're really, really cool."

17:06.163 --> 17:09.597
Other times, they just say,
"Austin, you're cool."

17:10.199 --> 17:11.266
So...

17:13.135 --> 17:15.537
So is that supposed to
make me feel better?

17:16.705 --> 17:18.039
Okay, bad example.

17:18.973 --> 17:20.075
I have a better one.

17:21.711 --> 17:24.713
When I was a kid, I took
a ballroom dance class.

17:25.815 --> 17:30.085
Some of my friends teased me and I
wanted to quit, but I'm glad I didn't.

17:30.087 --> 17:33.655
That class helped make
me an awesome dancer.

17:34.790 --> 17:37.525
I get what you're saying,
but I'm not coming back.

17:37.527 --> 17:38.660
Well, just think about it.

17:38.662 --> 17:39.728
Don't need to.

17:39.730 --> 17:40.995
Not coming back.

17:42.064 --> 17:44.299
Okay, well... let me know
when you make a decision!

17:45.234 --> 17:46.301
Good talk!

17:56.946 --> 17:58.313
I don't think Dylan's
coming back.

17:58.315 --> 17:59.848
What makes you say that?

17:59.850 --> 18:01.783
Because she said, "I'm
not coming back."

18:01.785 --> 18:03.084
Like, nine times.

18:03.086 --> 18:05.320
But I'm still hoping she's
gonna change her mind.

18:05.322 --> 18:08.123
I don't know how much longer
we can have Herman stall.

18:08.125 --> 18:11.559
Yeah, people are getting sick of
watching him show off his eyesight.

18:11.561 --> 18:15.997
Doors must remain unlocked
during business hours.

18:18.768 --> 18:21.736
Restrooms for patrons only.

18:24.840 --> 18:25.741
Hi.

18:25.772 --> 18:29.344
Beverly Robbins, senior editor,
Miami Daily Star Gazette.

18:29.346 --> 18:33.248
We're all excited to see if you
actually made a band in one week.

18:33.250 --> 18:34.349
Are we?

18:34.351 --> 18:36.251
Are we all excited?

18:37.286 --> 18:39.354
It's gonna be great, guys.

18:39.356 --> 18:41.656
But would you mind not
mentioning my name up there?

18:41.658 --> 18:43.057
Okay, thanks.

18:43.059 --> 18:45.360
Made in Taiwan.

18:46.595 --> 18:47.662
Herman, it's okay.

18:49.298 --> 18:50.665
Uh, hi.

18:52.117 --> 18:55.170
Welcome to the grand opening
of the A&A music factory.

18:55.172 --> 18:56.671
Dez, wanna do the honors?

18:57.907 --> 19:00.175
Oh, man. I forgot my
giant pair of scissors.

19:00.177 --> 19:02.877
Oh, good thing I brought
my toenail scissors.

19:04.346 --> 19:05.380
Um...

19:28.671 --> 19:30.238
Ta-da!

19:34.310 --> 19:37.645
Last week we began working with
a group of brand new students.

19:37.647 --> 19:39.681
And tonight, they're
gonna perform a song.

19:39.683 --> 19:42.317
And when Austin
says "brand new,"

19:42.319 --> 19:44.786
he means brand new.

19:44.788 --> 19:47.155
Like they'd never even
touched instruments before.

19:47.157 --> 19:48.189
Like ever.

19:48.191 --> 19:49.858
Like never, ever.

19:49.860 --> 19:53.695
So if they were even able to make
a sound with their instruments,

19:53.697 --> 19:54.955
that alone would be a victory.

19:54.986 --> 19:58.099
I mean, especially considering that
we don't have a lead guitarist.

19:58.101 --> 19:59.167
Wait!

20:00.669 --> 20:02.103
You came back.

20:02.105 --> 20:03.137
Yeah.

20:03.139 --> 20:04.939
I want to be in the band.

20:04.941 --> 20:08.276
Your story about taking ballroom
dancing really helped me.

20:08.278 --> 20:10.712
It made you realize that you shouldn't
care what your friends think?

20:10.714 --> 20:11.454
No.

20:11.485 --> 20:14.415
It gave my friends something
way lamer to make fun of.

20:14.417 --> 20:15.683
So thanks.

20:17.888 --> 20:19.754
You took ballroom dancing? Ha!

20:20.723 --> 20:22.156
Dez, we took it together.

20:23.359 --> 20:24.392
Oh, yeah.

20:25.895 --> 20:27.462
Let's do this, guys.

21:03.432 --> 21:06.067
Beverly Robbins, senior editor.

21:06.069 --> 21:07.368
Yeah, yeah, we know, Bev'.

21:08.504 --> 21:12.373
I think I speak for everyone
when I say how impressed I am

21:12.375 --> 21:14.842
that these kids were able
to rise to the challenge.

21:14.844 --> 21:17.178
I don't know, I thought
they missed a few notes.

21:17.180 --> 21:18.246
Dez!

21:19.248 --> 21:20.995
Mom, can I keep taking lessons?

21:21.026 --> 21:25.053
Music is just as fun as bashing
in the skull of a zombie corpse.

21:25.055 --> 21:27.088
That makes me so happy.

21:28.023 --> 21:29.357
And a little disturbed.

21:31.360 --> 21:33.461
We destroyed that song!

21:33.463 --> 21:35.330
In the good way.

21:35.332 --> 21:37.231
Now I'm great at two things:

21:37.233 --> 21:39.534
Baseball and rock and roll!

21:41.003 --> 21:43.204
Hey, let's do another song.

21:43.206 --> 21:44.272
Yeah.

21:49.278 --> 21:52.480
I would just like to point out we
only taught them the one song.

21:53.415 --> 21:54.482
Just the one.

21:58.487 --> 22:00.488
Hey. What are you
guys looking at?

22:00.490 --> 22:04.225
It's the article by Beverly Robbins,
senior editor, Miami Daily Star Gazette.

22:04.227 --> 22:05.560
Oh. What'd she say?

22:07.162 --> 22:09.998
Fantastic. Amazing.
Bright future ahead.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.333
Wow, she really loves
the music factory.

22:12.335 --> 22:14.302
No, that was about her son, Max.

22:14.304 --> 22:16.204
But she did mention
us at the very end.

22:16.206 --> 22:19.307
The A&A music factory
was more than adequate

22:19.309 --> 22:21.409
in recognizing Max's
natural talent.

22:21.411 --> 22:23.845
Yeah! I told you guys you
were more than adequate.

22:25.481 --> 22:27.815
Well, speaking of
natural talent,

22:27.817 --> 22:29.851
Austin, I hear you're quite
the ballroom dancer.

22:29.853 --> 22:31.586
Oh, you tell me.

22:33.188 --> 22:35.148
<i>May I have this dance?</i>

22:46.402 --> 22:48.369
Uh, mind if I cut in?

22:48.371 --> 22:49.811
- Sure.
- Yes, I... oh.
