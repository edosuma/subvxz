Puck's got a thing</i>

00:03.802 --> 00:05.203

really down with it.</i>

00:05.270 --> 00:06.938
I don't think you're
ready for this jelly.

00:07.005 --> 00:09.073
<i>Finn kissed Quinn, who's
supposed to be dating Sam,</i>

00:09.141 --> 00:10.908
<i>and Rachel kissed Finn too, but
he didn't feel the fireworks.</i>

00:10.976 --> 00:12.543
<i>On the cheek?
Can you believe that?</i>

00:12.611 --> 00:14.078
<i>Sue tried to shoot Brittany out
of a cannon to win Nationals,</i>

00:14.146 --> 00:15.480
<i>but the only thing she won</i>

00:15.547 --> 00:16.381
<i>was Katie Couric's
"Loser of the Year."</i>

00:16.448 --> 00:18.516
I hate you, Diane Sawyer.

00:18.584 --> 00:19.584
<i>And that's what
you missed on Glee.</i>

00:22.287 --> 00:23.654
<i>WILL:
I actually learned something</i>

00:23.722 --> 00:25.156
<i>in my Spanish class today.</i>

00:25.224 --> 00:26.190
<i>"Regresar."</i>

00:28.193 --> 00:30.194
Who knows what that means?

00:30.262 --> 00:32.363
"To come back."

00:32.430 --> 00:35.266
<i>That's right. I realized
the old Will Schuster was back.</i>

00:35.334 --> 00:36.834

<i>I'm past Terry. I'm over Emma.</i>

00:40.973 --> 00:42.840
"To come back."
Now, if we're going

00:42.908 --> 00:44.809
to put it in the past...
Will?

00:44.877 --> 00:45.977

She doesn't have a pulse.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.153
Yeah, I do.
[Will and Emma gasping]

01:29.221 --> 01:30.621
I just stopped my own heart.

01:30.689 --> 01:32.290
That's my CIA training.

01:32.357 --> 01:34.592
These gummi vitamins
didn't work at all.

01:34.660 --> 01:36.160
I was told you take
enough Vitamin A,

01:36.228 --> 01:37.328
and you drift off

01:37.396 --> 01:38.396
into a blissful oblivion.

01:38.464 --> 01:39.730
Instead, my face
just got really hot

01:39.798 --> 01:41.265
and my jaw is sore
from all that chewing.

01:41.333 --> 01:43.301
[annoyed sigh]

01:43.368 --> 01:45.937

That's not untrue.

01:47.639 --> 01:49.874
Emma, we didn't come here
to give her a pep talk.

01:49.942 --> 01:52.176
I'm sorry, Sue,
but you brought
this on yourself.

01:52.244 --> 01:54.679
I am well aware
of my situation, Will.

01:54.746 --> 01:56.647
After my humiliating failure

01:56.715 --> 01:58.249
to qualify for Nationals,

01:58.317 --> 02:00.384
there is nothing for
me or my Cheerios!

02:00.452 --> 02:02.453
to do for the
rest of the year.

02:02.521 --> 02:04.155
Why don't you do what
other cheer squads do--

02:04.223 --> 02:05.857
namely, cheer for the
teams at the school?

02:05.924 --> 02:07.425
Yeah, like that's going
to happen.

02:07.493 --> 02:09.060
Emma, let's go.

02:09.127 --> 02:12.964
Sue, you are nasty,
manipulative and petty.

02:13.031 --> 02:15.066
Will, you have
more grease in your hair

02:15.133 --> 02:16.667
than the guy behind WikiLeaks.

Oh, I for one, am not
going to play backup

02:18.370 --> 02:19.370

02:26.578 --> 02:28.579
Hey.
Hi.

02:30.816 --> 02:34.051
So I wanted to confirm our date
on Friday at Color Me Mine.

02:34.119 --> 02:35.820
Wait, you were serious
about that?

02:35.888 --> 02:38.556
It's painting coasters time.

02:39.858 --> 02:42.693
So, we good for Friday?

02:42.761 --> 02:44.795
Yeah. I think so.

02:44.863 --> 02:47.732
I mean, I don't think I
have anything else to do.

02:47.799 --> 02:48.699

The only way to make
a complete comeback

popular discussion,

04:55.360 --> 04:57.094
I have you half
of my allowance

04:57.162 --> 04:58.496

signature look of mine

04:58.563 --> 04:59.730
and make it popular.

04:59.798 --> 05:01.132
And we decided tha
legwarmers were more likely

05:01.199 --> 05:02.433

than reindeer sweaters.

Yes, precisely,

them incorrectly.

that there were rules.

05:07.439 --> 05:09.507
Of course there are rules.
They're legwarmers.

05:09.574 --> 05:11.909
Well, can I wear them
that way tomorrow?

05:11.977 --> 05:14.011
I wore a tank top today

a matter of time

Hey... Will, Esmé.

06:02.828 --> 06:05.362
So sorry for not being
sorry for interrupting.

06:05.430 --> 06:06.464
But would you mind

06:06.531 --> 06:07.898
if I borrowed one
of your rafters

06:07.966 --> 06:10.201
so I could hang myself?

06:10.268 --> 06:11.635
I just did a test run
back in my office,

06:11.703 --> 06:13.938
and you know what?
There's asbestos up there,

06:14.005 --> 06:15.806

kill a person.

your epic decline

06:27.586 --> 06:29.253

felt yourself

06:29.321 --> 06:30.688

06:30.756 --> 06:33.390
Well, yes, Will,

06:33.458 --> 06:35.226
as a matter of fact,
there was...

06:35.293 --> 06:37.194
there was one moment.

06:37.262 --> 06:40.331
I was driving to work
this morning in my LeCar,

06:40.398 --> 06:43.901
and Charlene's "I've Never
Been To Me" came on the radio.

06:43.969 --> 06:45.536
And when it got to the chorus,

06:45.604 --> 06:48.405
I just opened my mouth and
belted it out with her.

06:48.473 --> 06:50.608
And I have to say,
it felt really good.

06:50.675 --> 06:52.676
Sue should join
the Glee Club.

06:52.744 --> 06:53.844
I'm sorry?

06:53.912 --> 06:55.479
No, I'd rather be dead.

06:55.547 --> 06:57.047
Yes. She should join--
I mean, you can't join,

06:57.115 --> 06:58.182
but she can sit in.

06:58.250 --> 06:59.416
Yes. Will.

06:59.484 --> 07:02.286
Look, Sue is in a really
bad place right now.

07:02.354 --> 07:05.456
And you're always talking about
the healing power of music.

07:05.524 --> 07:07.158
There are studies that show
it helps with depression,

07:07.225 --> 07:08.559
it elevates mood.

07:08.627 --> 07:09.660
I have a pamphlet.

07:12.531 --> 07:15.599
Uh... Emma, I don't think
this is a good idea at all.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.468
I agree with
SpongeHair SquareChin.

07:17.536 --> 07:19.403
It's a stupid idea.

07:19.471 --> 07:20.971
No, no. The football team
did it for a spell,

07:21.039 --> 07:23.073
and that really
brought people together.

07:23.141 --> 07:25.609
Will, and this is
a great chance

07:25.677 --> 07:26.977
for you to keep
your eye on Sue.

07:27.045 --> 07:29.013
You know, make sure
the old gal's okay.

07:31.316 --> 07:32.883
Well, you know what, folks?
At this point,

07:32.951 --> 07:35.119

my crippling depression,

07:35.187 --> 07:37.354
I'd do anything.

07:38.523 --> 07:40.191
[chuckles]

07:40.258 --> 07:41.725
This cannot be happening.

07:41.793 --> 07:43.360
This seems like a terrible idea.

07:43.428 --> 07:46.130
Guys, it's not up
for discussion, okay?

07:46.198 --> 07:48.299
Now, it's no secret that Coach
Sylvester has taken her licks...

07:48.366 --> 07:49.967
I mean, just wanky.

07:50.035 --> 07:52.536
And I believe she could use
a little sympathy from us.

07:52.604 --> 07:54.805
Sympathy? From us? Uh-uh.

07:54.873 --> 07:56.907
Yeah, all she's ever done
is make our lives miserable.

07:56.975 --> 07:58.676
She got exactly
what she deserved.

07:58.743 --> 08:00.811
You're lucky I left my blowgun
at home, Airbags,

08:00.879 --> 08:02.680
'cause I got a clear shot
at your nonnies.

08:02.747 --> 08:05.850
WILL: Guys, Coach Sylvester
has had her recent setbacks,

08:05.917 --> 08:07.918
but she is a proven champion.

08:07.986 --> 08:09.386
Now, we could do worse

08:09.454 --> 08:11.388
than to have that kindf
a winning record in our midst.

08:11.456 --> 08:12.489
SUE: Let me break it
down for you.

08:12.557 --> 08:15.059
I am no longer a threat
to you people.

08:15.126 --> 08:17.695
All right? I'm just hoping that
your singing and dancing around

08:17.762 --> 08:20.364
will pull me out of
my doldrums and give me

08:20.432 --> 08:22.967
a reason to live.
Is that too much to ask?

08:23.034 --> 08:25.202
Guys, it's settled.

08:25.270 --> 08:26.570
Sue's going to be
with us for the week.

08:26.638 --> 08:29.673
Now... I received an envelope
in the mail today.

08:29.741 --> 08:31.141
[murmuring]

08:31.209 --> 08:32.842
We know that we're facing Kurt
and the Warblers at Regionals.

08:32.910 --> 08:33.943
Sweet Porcelain.

08:34.011 --> 08:35.546
And it looks like this year,

08:35.614 --> 08:37.514
we face Aural Intensity again.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.582
They cleaned our clock
last year.

08:39.650 --> 08:40.818
Seems like
the governing board

08:40.885 --> 08:43.621
has assigned a theme
to this year's Regionals,

08:43.688 --> 08:45.022
and part of our score
will be based

08:45.090 --> 08:47.458
upon how well we interpret it.
This year's theme--

08:47.525 --> 08:50.628
"Anthem." Now, who can
tell us what an anthem is?

08:50.695 --> 08:52.029
The bottom of an ant's pants.

08:52.097 --> 08:54.131
So close.
So close. No.

08:54.199 --> 08:56.333
An anthem is an epic song,

08:56.401 --> 08:58.702
filled with
a groundswell of emotion

08:58.770 --> 09:00.237
that somehow seems
bigger than itself.

09:00.305 --> 09:02.673
Even bigger than the person
performing it.
Mr. Shue?

09:02.741 --> 09:04.575
Oh, hey, Sam, I didn't even
notice your new haircut.

09:04.643 --> 09:06.944
Yeah. I've been working
on a new image to go

09:07.012 --> 09:08.545
with my new one-man band,
The Justin Bieber Experience.

09:08.613 --> 09:10.814
You've got to be kidding me.

09:10.882 --> 09:13.150
Dude. That haircut makes
your mouth look even bigger.

09:13.218 --> 09:15.085
Let her speak.

09:15.153 --> 09:16.720
Look, laugh all you want,
but that kid's an epic talent,

09:16.788 --> 09:17.922
and there's a number
I've been working on

09:17.989 --> 09:19.456
that I've been wanting
to show off.

09:19.524 --> 09:21.358
And I think it
qualifies as an anthem,

09:21.426 --> 09:24.094
because it's
just hugely emotional,

09:24.162 --> 09:25.763
and sums up
our generation.

09:25.830 --> 09:28.098
All right.
Let's hear it, buddy.

11:39.330 --> 11:41.365
I got to get that girl
on my Cheerios!

11:45.166 --> 11:47.134
[bell rings]
We want in.

11:47.202 --> 11:49.203
In what?

11:49.270 --> 11:50.504
The Justin Bieber Experience.

11:50.572 --> 11:51.805
We want in the band.

11:51.873 --> 11:53.340
But it's a one-man band.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.408
So expand.

11:54.476 --> 11:55.943
I don't get it, you guys were

11:56.010 --> 11:57.544
totally making fun of me
for singing Bieber.

11:57.612 --> 11:59.279
That's because we underestimated
the power of the Biebes.

11:59.347 --> 12:01.648
He's clearly like
a mini-god.

12:01.716 --> 12:03.183
Look how you made
all those chicks melt

12:03.251 --> 12:04.351
in Glee Club;
now think about

12:04.419 --> 12:05.619
the power of four Biebers.

12:05.687 --> 12:06.820
We'd be unstoppable.

12:06.888 --> 12:08.689
All of our relationships
are in the standard

12:08.757 --> 12:09.656

Are you playing
Angry Birds?

12:13.061 --> 12:14.194
Sorry.

12:14.262 --> 12:15.996
Want me to show
you my abs?

12:16.064 --> 12:17.231
If you want to.

12:21.035 --> 12:22.770
Here's what happens
to the female chemistry.

12:22.837 --> 12:24.638
They get a huge shot
of endorphins

12:24.706 --> 12:26.340
on Valentine's Day,
and everything is heightened

12:26.407 --> 12:27.875
and so romantic--
the problem is,

12:27.942 --> 12:30.477
days later, when they come down
from their See's candy high,

12:30.545 --> 12:32.012
they crash,
and everything else,

12:32.080 --> 12:33.514
by comparison, is humdrum.

12:33.581 --> 12:35.349
We need the sugary sweet jolt
of the Biebes

12:35.416 --> 12:36.750
to get us some action again.

12:36.818 --> 12:38.318
Why do you want in, Puckerman?

12:38.386 --> 12:40.287
I'm at the end
of my Lauren Zises rope.

12:40.355 --> 12:42.189
I'll try anything to get
into those enormous pants.

12:42.257 --> 12:44.124
Uh, what's going on?

12:44.192 --> 12:45.192
ARTIE:
We're joining

12:45.260 --> 12:46.727
The Justin Bieber Experience,

12:46.795 --> 12:48.629
if Sam's cool with it.

12:48.696 --> 12:49.997
And if not, we're
starting our own band.

12:50.064 --> 12:51.532
Bieber Fever.

12:51.599 --> 12:53.467
Wait, you-you guys
do realize that

12:53.535 --> 12:55.569
Justin Bieber sucks, right?

12:55.637 --> 12:57.671
Quinn seemed to be
pretty into him when I
was singing in Glee Club.

12:57.739 --> 12:59.173
Right, well,
I'm gonna spend my time

12:59.240 --> 13:00.908
working on songs that aren't
geared toward 12-year-olds.

13:00.975 --> 13:02.309
Good.
And then you won't

13:02.377 --> 13:03.977
have time to pick up any
other guys' girlfriends.

13:04.045 --> 13:05.379
Hey... back off, man.

13:05.446 --> 13:06.847
I didn't kiss your girlfriend.

13:06.915 --> 13:08.782
She saved my life.

13:10.185 --> 13:11.451
MIKE:
So, what do you say?

13:11.519 --> 13:13.787
Are we in?

13:13.855 --> 13:15.856
Fine. But we need
to figure out

13:15.924 --> 13:17.257
something to do
with Puckerman's hair.

13:17.325 --> 13:19.159
[bell rings]

13:19.227 --> 13:21.128
[indistinct chatter]

13:24.299 --> 13:25.833
Oh, no.

13:29.971 --> 13:32.172
No way.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.241
You're a genius-- they
have changed my life.

13:34.309 --> 13:36.643
I didn't know my arms
could be so toasty.

13:36.711 --> 13:38.078
You're a hero--
you should win

13:38.146 --> 13:39.279
some kind of award.

13:39.347 --> 13:41.448
[whispers]:
What are you doing?

13:41.516 --> 13:43.684
I'm so sorry, Rachel,
it just sort of caught on.

13:43.751 --> 13:45.786
I see that, okay?
That is not what
we agreed upon!

13:45.854 --> 13:47.154
I want my allowance
back right now!

13:47.222 --> 13:48.155
It's already gone.

13:48.223 --> 13:49.423
My uncle lost his job,

13:49.490 --> 13:51.191
and his goat was
going hungry, so...

13:51.259 --> 13:52.860
I spent it on food
for the goat.

13:52.927 --> 13:55.095
I mean, sort of.
The goat just ate the money.

13:55.163 --> 13:58.065
Okay, the-the only way
to proceed is for you to come

13:58.132 --> 14:00.467
to school dressed
exactly like me.

14:01.970 --> 14:03.070
What is that

[knocking on door]

14:44.512 --> 14:45.646
You wanted to see me?

14:45.713 --> 14:47.948
Yes. Mercedes, have a seat.

14:49.684 --> 14:53.353
So, I've decided I'm going
to sing a song in Glee Club,

14:53.421 --> 14:54.988
and I need your advice.

14:55.056 --> 14:57.524
Now, as you may know,
I have a background in music.

14:57.592 --> 15:00.527
For a brief period, I
was a tambourine player
for Wilson-Phillips.

15:00.595 --> 15:02.095
What I need to
learn from you

15:02.163 --> 15:04.464
is how to be a diva.

15:04.532 --> 15:07.434
Oh. Well, you've definitely
come to the right girl.

15:07.502 --> 15:09.503
I mean, being a diva
is all about attitude,

15:09.570 --> 15:11.305
something I know
you're not short on.

15:11.372 --> 15:13.774
It's all about sassy fingers
and shaking that weave

15:13.841 --> 15:17.177
and generally, taking
no nonsense from nobody.

15:17.245 --> 15:18.211
Dig it, sister.

15:18.279 --> 15:19.446
<i>Well, I have to say</i>

15:19.514 --> 15:21.682
I'm flattered and shocked
that you came to me.

15:21.749 --> 15:24.117
Oh, come, now, "Ra-chelle,"
it doesn't humble me too much

15:24.185 --> 15:26.119
to say I simply
need your tutelage.

15:26.187 --> 15:29.156
Well, I'll say this-- being
a diva is all about emotion.

15:29.223 --> 15:31.058
In fact, you feel
so much emotion

15:31.125 --> 15:32.759
that it cannot be
physically contained.

15:32.827 --> 15:34.461
Sometimes you have
to close your eyes

15:34.529 --> 15:36.396
and turn your head and push,

15:36.464 --> 15:38.966
push your feelings away--
they're that big!

15:40.301 --> 15:41.735
Wow.

15:41.803 --> 15:44.604
Well, that Mercedes
is wrong about you.

15:44.672 --> 15:46.773
What... what
did she say?

15:46.841 --> 15:48.976
Oh, I don't remember
the specifics, just
something about

15:49.043 --> 15:51.211
you're not as talented
as you think you are

15:51.279 --> 15:52.813
and all your ideas
are horrible.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.349
I don't know,
something like that.

15:55.416 --> 15:56.817
She said what?

15:56.884 --> 15:58.151
Yep. Quote:

15:58.219 --> 15:59.853
"Not that talented."

16:02.223 --> 16:04.558
There you are. I heard what you
said about me.

16:04.625 --> 16:06.059
I heard what you said about me.

16:06.127 --> 16:07.394
Just when I thought
we were friends.

16:07.462 --> 16:09.096
I guess that will just
never happen, will it?

16:09.163 --> 16:10.364
I guess not.

16:10.431 --> 16:12.199
You know, there's only
one "I" in "diva," Rachel,

16:12.266 --> 16:14.134
and that "I" is me.

16:14.202 --> 16:16.236
Guess we're just gonna
have to settle this
the old-fashioned way.

16:16.304 --> 16:17.504
Diva-off.

16:17.572 --> 16:19.373
Tomorrow, Glee Club.
Why not right now?

16:19.440 --> 16:21.074

get my cross-trainers.

16:21.142 --> 16:22.542
Want to know why?

16:22.610 --> 16:24.678
I'm gonna be
doing some runs.

16:32.732 --> 16:34.399
So... Friday night,

16:34.467 --> 16:37.002
I figured we'd check out
the Sullivan rink.

16:37.070 --> 16:39.404
They have ice rink
bumper cars.

16:39.472 --> 16:42.541
I told you, I haven't decided
what I'm doing yet.

to give us their anthem.

the new and improved

17:07.599 --> 17:09.334

17:09.402 --> 17:11.670
and we think
this song is an anthem

17:11.737 --> 17:13.771
because everything
Bieber does is epic.

17:13.839 --> 17:14.772
Truth.

17:14.840 --> 17:16.007
Anyway, this song,

17:16.075 --> 17:17.776
like all the songs I sing,

17:17.844 --> 17:19.077
is for my girlfriend Quinn.

I need a towel.

19:34.847 --> 19:36.881
Hey!

19:38.718 --> 19:41.353
I... I actually
can't do Friday.

19:46.092 --> 19:47.325
Hey, Lauren.

19:47.393 --> 19:48.393
So, uh,

19:48.461 --> 19:49.628
what'd you think?

19:49.695 --> 19:52.964
Honestly, although
my love would crush him,

19:53.032 --> 19:55.767
I'm totally turned on
by the Biebster.

19:55.835 --> 19:58.737
That is, until I remember
that he looks like he's 12;

19:58.804 --> 20:00.272
then it's sort of creepy.

20:00.339 --> 20:02.774
So if I were gonna give
you a grade: C-plus.

20:04.110 --> 20:05.543
Listen, Zises,

20:05.611 --> 20:07.412
I'm dying here.
You got me

20:07.480 --> 20:09.447
every which way, and we both
know I'm not the brightest.

20:09.515 --> 20:12.817
So, please!-- what do I
have to do to get with you?

20:12.885 --> 20:14.919
I may have
a proposition for you.

20:14.987 --> 20:16.154
I'll keep you posted.

20:23.129 --> 20:25.030
Color Me Mine?

20:25.097 --> 20:28.700
I'll color you
yours any day.

20:38.577 --> 20:40.578
Mm, Sammy Evans!

20:40.646 --> 20:43.148
You are Biebalicious.

20:43.215 --> 20:45.684
How are things going
with you and Quinn?

20:45.751 --> 20:46.584
Fine.

20:46.652 --> 20:48.386
No, they're not.

20:48.454 --> 20:51.256
You and I should,
uh, talk soon.

20:58.907 --> 21:00.641
Sam's an artist, Finn.
An artist?

21:00.709 --> 21:03.410
I guess that's why he's
taking you to Color Me Mine.

21:03.478 --> 21:05.145
I told you I needed time
to figure out

21:05.213 --> 21:07.114
what I was gonna do
with Sam, and I did.

21:07.182 --> 21:09.750
I choose him.
Because of The Justin
Bieber Experience?

21:09.818 --> 21:11.885
Look, I thought it was
gonna be stupid, too,

21:11.953 --> 21:14.288
but he was so... shameless.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.990
He just got up there
and owned it.

21:17.058 --> 21:18.492
It was sexy.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.361
I'm sorry, Finn.

21:20.428 --> 21:23.163
But like I said,
Sam's an artist,

21:23.231 --> 21:26.233
and at the end of the day...

Shut it, Puckerman--
we're here to talk business.

21:58.366 --> 21:59.633
Sorry.

21:59.701 --> 22:02.770
Okay, I want to do
a number for Glee Club.

22:02.837 --> 22:05.005
It's stage one
of my master plan.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.441
Shibby. So what, you want me
to back you up on my ax?

22:07.509 --> 22:10.511
Yeah, but I also
need some advice.

22:10.578 --> 22:13.781
I'm a little bit nervous about
singing in front of a crowd.

22:13.848 --> 22:16.517
Up until now, I've only really
sung in the steam shower.

22:16.584 --> 22:18.452
Hot. But ridiculous.

22:18.520 --> 22:20.888
I mean, you're the most
confident chick I know.

22:20.955 --> 22:22.656
Yeah, I know
I'm hot melted butter,

22:22.724 --> 22:24.825
but singing's different,
and I want to be great.

22:24.893 --> 22:26.927
Or at least as good as Barry.

22:26.995 --> 22:28.462
I get nervous
before I sing, too.

22:28.530 --> 22:29.830
But I always overcome.

22:29.898 --> 22:31.632
You want to know my secret?

22:31.699 --> 22:33.267
Yeah.

22:33.334 --> 22:34.568
Oldest trick in the book.

22:34.636 --> 22:35.736
Just picture the audience
in their underwear.

22:35.804 --> 22:36.870
Even the dudes?

22:36.938 --> 22:38.105
It's not about sex.

22:38.173 --> 22:39.873
It's just about
seeing the audience

22:39.941 --> 22:40.974
as more vulnerable
than you.

22:41.042 --> 22:42.676
Trust me.
It works every time.

22:42.744 --> 22:43.844
Can I touch your
knockers now?

22:43.912 --> 22:45.312
Only if you want
to lose a hand.

I really do.

23:00.261 --> 23:01.628

to go viral.

23:01.696 --> 23:03.363
Is there any way you can cut
class for the rest of the day,

23:03.431 --> 23:04.765
just so that you could
walk down the halls?

23:04.833 --> 23:06.333
Totally. Most teachers
think by cutting class,

23:06.401 --> 23:07.334
I might improve
my grades.

23:07.402 --> 23:08.469
Great.

23:08.536 --> 23:10.370

into the Biebster.

23:12.207 --> 23:13.874
Well, I wasn't, but
then somebody told me

23:13.942 --> 23:15.776
that Justin Bieber's,
like, the king of YouTube

23:15.844 --> 23:17.377
with over a
billion views.

23:17.445 --> 23:19.646

appeal to the masses, right?

23:19.714 --> 23:21.482
So before I pick my anthem,

23:21.549 --> 23:23.717
I was working
on my anthem look.

23:28.323 --> 23:30.991
Okay, guys and gals!
And Sue.

23:31.059 --> 23:32.726

all been waiting for.

23:32.794 --> 23:34.328
Our next diva-off.

23:34.395 --> 23:37.231
So here they are, sure
to give us a fantastic anthem,

23:37.298 --> 23:38.765
Mercedes and Rachel.

[scattered cheers, applause]

23:41.336 --> 23:44.004
Uh, after much argument,
I finally convinced Mercedes

23:44.072 --> 23:45.672
that in order to do
a proper diva-off,

23:45.740 --> 23:47.741
it has to come from
the Broadway catalogue.

23:47.809 --> 23:49.142
Which I think
is safe to say

23:49.210 --> 23:50.878
that that gives me
a home field advantage, so...

23:50.945 --> 23:52.045

to get beat on your own turf.

you get uncomfortable.

27:15.719 --> 27:17.386
Not really joking, William.

27:31.801 --> 27:33.335
I know what
you're getting at.

27:33.403 --> 27:34.770
I have been selfish.

27:34.838 --> 27:36.672
Yes, I was ridiculed
on the national stage,

27:36.740 --> 27:38.173

that's nothing

39:03.877 --> 39:05.777
Kind of have a thing for

Wait... Why?

Because you can't
look me in the eye right now

didn't make out with Finn.

a big thank-you.
She may hate us,

39:54.360 --> 39:56.995

a kick-butt song for Regionals.

I... I have to say that

I don't think that that song
is good enough for Regionals.

Guys, this

40:27.827 --> 40:29.761
isn't about me.
What do you suggest, Rachel?

40:29.829 --> 40:31.997
We need to need
to be bold and epic.

40:32.065 --> 40:33.198
We need to write

40:33.266 --> 40:34.566
our own original music
for Regionals.

You know, I have to
be honest, we missed
you in here today.

41:07.333 --> 41:09.368
Oddly, you're, uh,
kind of a fun addition.

41:09.435 --> 41:11.536
Oh, well, Charles Manson
would have been

41:11.604 --> 41:13.972

your pack of losers.

41:14.040 --> 41:16.375
Well, looks like you're
back to your old self.

41:16.442 --> 41:17.509
Ah, hardly.

41:17.577 --> 41:19.011
I'm on my way to becoming

41:19.078 --> 41:20.345
someone much better.

41:20.413 --> 41:21.780
And you've inspired me, Will.

41:21.848 --> 41:24.316
You've made me realize
I have more to offer the world

41:24.384 --> 41:25.917
than coming up
with spectacular,

41:25.985 --> 41:27.552
life-threatening
cheerleading tumbles.

41:27.620 --> 41:29.488

41:29.555 --> 41:31.390
Sue, that is great.
[chuckles]

41:31.457 --> 41:34.226
I mean, with that attitude, you
are welcome in here anytime.

41:34.293 --> 41:37.562
Oh, I couldn't do that; it'd
be spying on the competition.

41:37.630 --> 41:38.797
What?

41:38.865 --> 41:40.198
No one told you?

41:40.266 --> 41:41.933
I got a part-time gig.

41:42.001 --> 41:44.836
Yeah, I'm the new coach
for Aural Intensity.

41:44.904 --> 41:46.304
That's impossible.

41:46.372 --> 41:47.539
Oh, nothing's impossible, Will,

41:47.607 --> 41:48.974

a positive attitude.

41:49.042 --> 41:50.142
You taught me that.

41:50.209 --> 41:51.910
Isn't it great?

42:15.868 --> 42:17.102
Quinn is back

42:17.170 --> 42:19.237
She'll be easy pickings
after what Sam did to her.

42:19.305 --> 42:20.672
I don't want to
talk about Quinn.

42:20.740 --> 42:21.873
I want to talk
about you.

42:21.941 --> 42:23.275
You were right
in there today

42:23.342 --> 42:25.277
about that number not
being good enough to win.

42:25.344 --> 42:26.945
We need to write
our own songs.

42:27.013 --> 42:29.147
Why didn't you say that
when I needed you?

42:29.215 --> 42:30.382
It wouldn't have
made a difference.

42:30.450 --> 42:32.017
The only way to prove
it to those guys

42:32.085 --> 42:34.586
is to write a great
song and shove it
down their throats.

42:34.654 --> 42:38.290
Well, do you think that you
and I should do it together?

42:38.357 --> 42:40.659
No, I think you
should do it yourself.

42:40.727 --> 42:43.228
Let's face it, you're the real
trendsetter in there, and...

42:43.296 --> 42:46.198
if someone was gonna write
a song to win Regionals,
it would be you.

42:46.265 --> 42:48.467
Do you really believe
in me that much?

42:48.534 --> 42:49.968
More.

42:55.241 --> 42:56.908
You know...

42:56.976 --> 42:59.811
I really like the Rachel
that I saw in there today.

42:59.879 --> 43:03.448
Reminded me
of the old you.

43:03.516 --> 43:05.917
Focused and
take no prisoners.

43:08.988 --> 43:10.989
I think she might be
making a comeback.
