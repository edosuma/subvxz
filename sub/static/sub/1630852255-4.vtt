Sorry, I, I, I feel

-Barista: Here you go.
Two nonfat lattes.
-Yes, thank you.

00:55.430 --> 00:59.225
I know, but if we
want to submit to Sundance,
we gotta get moving.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.102
Two nonfat lattes, please.
Thank you.

Look, I know we
only have a minute,
but Charlotte has

01:32.008 --> 01:35.011
a quick update
on the field trip.

01:35.094 --> 01:36.805
Good news on
the Botanic Gardens.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.723
I was able to book
the botany team

01:38.807 --> 01:40.350
that was profiled in
"New York Magazine."

01:40.433 --> 01:41.768
-I love that.
-Wow!

01:41.851 --> 01:43.561
-That is so cool.
-Or I could call my friend

01:43.645 --> 01:47.273
who runs this
state-of-the-art animal
shelter on City Island.

with the animals.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.739
I'm an animal lover, too,

01:54.823 --> 01:57.700
but I did just spend
three weeks chasing
down these botanists,

01:57.784 --> 02:00.370
and they're very
hard to reach.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.747
-One of whom is deaf,
incidentally.
-Of course, I get it.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.291
It was just
a backup idea.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.835
I hadn't heard
from you on this
all week,

02:06.918 --> 02:07.544

dropped the ball.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.213
Oh... (laughs)

02:10.295 --> 02:12.674
Charlotte's never
dropped a ball
in her life.

02:12.757 --> 02:14.259
Check your spam, Deirdre.
The whole chain is there.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.928
I think we should just
lock down the botanists

02:17.011 --> 02:19.264
and save the animal
shelter for another date.

02:19.347 --> 02:21.558
Questions?
No questions.

Have a great day.

fall off my calendar.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.119
again the next day?
I mean, who does that?

11:43.202 --> 11:47.415
Why don't you wash
your bath towels more
than once a year?

11:47.498 --> 11:49.708
-Fucking kindergartener.
-(Che laughing)

11:49.792 --> 11:51.794
Jackie:
I wash my bath towels,
all right!

11:51.877 --> 11:53.337
Dude, you are so insensitive,
and not just to me.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.423
What you just
said to Carrie--

11:55.506 --> 11:56.465
-Young love.
-Not so young.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.634
-Not so love.
-(laughing)

12:01.387 --> 12:04.932
Oh, man. If that was me
Chloe was goin' off on,

12:05.015 --> 12:06.809
I would've totally
played the death card

12:06.892 --> 12:08.894
just to shut her down.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.439
Oh, I'm saving it
for when she tells me
I have to go back on Twitter.

12:11.522 --> 12:12.648
(laughs)

12:12.731 --> 12:15.901
Don't I have
a colonoscopy
the next day?

12:15.985 --> 12:17.111
Not anymore, you don't.

12:17.194 --> 12:19.071
This dinner is
too important.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.823
Right now,
Lisa and I are mom friends,

12:20.906 --> 12:23.033
but I want us
to be real friends.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.660
And they are
an impressive couple.

12:24.743 --> 12:27.455
-We are gonna
have to bring it.
-Okay.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.292
I invited Carrie
for fashion,

12:31.375 --> 12:32.793
Miranda for politics,

12:32.877 --> 12:35.379
Stanford and Anthony...
gay,

12:35.463 --> 12:38.466
the Shapiros,
the Downeys.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.384
-Bringin' out the big guns.
-Mm-hm.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.595
And I've got room
for one more couple.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.181
-How about the Tates?
-Hmm.

12:45.264 --> 12:45.681
They're sweet, but...

12:47.433 --> 12:49.477
they're just
kind of vanilla.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.104
Oh no.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.064
What?

12:55.274 --> 12:57.943
Everyone I've invited...
is vanilla.

12:58.027 --> 13:02.448
The Wexleys can't be the only
Black couple at the dinner.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.533
They're gonna think we
don't have any Black friends.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.036
Why don't you just ask
the Jenkins in 4C?

13:07.119 --> 13:11.874
The Jenkins!
Yes, yes, I love
the Jenkins, yes!

13:11.957 --> 13:16.003
-We just had that great brunch.
-Two years ago.

13:16.086 --> 13:18.839
But we lost
a year to COVID.

13:18.923 --> 13:19.840
I'm gonna text
her right now.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.722
-Oh, Charlotte, hi.
-Hello, Shelly.

13:26.805 --> 13:29.475
-What a beautiful sweater.
-Thank you.

13:29.558 --> 13:30.643
I just wanted to check in,

13:30.726 --> 13:32.478
and make sure that
you had received

13:32.561 --> 13:34.730
the texts I sent earlier.

13:34.813 --> 13:37.066
I did...
All four of them.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.151
Oh, I thought
I sent two.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.195
You know, I've gotta
get my phone checked.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.279
It just goes
rogue sometimes.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.406
(both chuckle)

13:44.490 --> 13:46.575
So will you be able
to join us for dinner?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.744
Oh, well,
as I said in my text,

13:48.827 --> 13:52.122
-we would love to join...
-Great! Terrific!

13:52.206 --> 13:54.333
but we already have
a dinner Thursday.

13:54.416 --> 13:57.211
Oh, right, but you know
what I was thinking?

13:57.294 --> 14:00.798
Maybe you and David
could pop in before
your dinner for drinks.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.424
You know, just pop in, say hi.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.509
We'll do it another time.

14:03.592 --> 14:05.594
Oh, but we always say

14:05.678 --> 14:07.054
we'll do it another time.

14:07.137 --> 14:09.765
Let's just...
get her done.

14:09.848 --> 14:12.601
I'll tell you what,
you text me

14:12.685 --> 14:14.937
when you know that you
definitely can't come,

14:15.020 --> 14:16.564
and in the meantime,

14:16.647 --> 14:20.192
that is just the most
lovely sweater.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.611
-Where'd you get it?
-J.Crew.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.655
Well, it is just gorgeous.

14:24.738 --> 14:27.157
Have a great rest of your day.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.036
-(locks door)
-(phone chimes)

14:34.206 --> 14:36.125
Charlotte (on phone):
Are you still in touch
with that artist you dated?

14:36.208 --> 14:38.752
Who do you mean?
The performance artist
with the big, juicy ass?

14:38.836 --> 14:42.298
-God no, I forgot about him.
-I didn't. Like two canned hams.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.632
No, I'm talking
about that painter.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.010
Oh, you mean
the hot Black guy.

14:46.093 --> 14:51.640
Anthony, he is more
than just his race.
He is a person...

14:51.724 --> 14:53.225
and, yes, that is who
I was referring to.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.853
I was thinking of
inviting him to
the Wexley dinner party.

14:55.936 --> 14:59.898
LTW has a collection
of African-American artists.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.483
Anthony:
Outta luck, princess.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.860
Stanford lit my old address
book on fire one night.

15:02.943 --> 15:06.071
You want me to ask Juan,
one of my delivery guys?

15:06.155 --> 15:08.616
He's Colombian,
but ethnically ambiguous.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.868
-Goodbye, Anthony.
-Goodbye!

15:13.412 --> 15:16.123
-Deirdre... Hi!
-Oh, hi!

15:16.206 --> 15:17.750
-I was just
gonna text you.
-Oh!

15:17.833 --> 15:20.586
By any chance,
are you and Geoff

15:20.669 --> 15:22.171
free for dinner
tomorrow night?

15:22.254 --> 15:24.423
Who's Geoff?

15:24.506 --> 15:26.717
-Your husband?
-Oh, (chuckles).
It's pronounced "Joff."

15:26.800 --> 15:31.221
-Oh.
-So last minute, but yes.

15:31.305 --> 15:34.016
Lovely.
I'll call Geoff
to make sure.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.852
Charlotte, oh my god,
I'm so sorry.

15:36.935 --> 15:38.479
We can't come
tomorrow night.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.105
My mother-in-law invited
us to the symphony,

15:40.189 --> 15:41.106
and Herbert didn't
tell me till this morning

15:41.190 --> 15:43.400
because as he said,
he didn't wanna hear me

15:43.484 --> 15:45.736
bitch about it all week,
and he's not wrong.

15:45.819 --> 15:48.947
-Of course, I get it.
Mother-in-law drama.
-(Lisa laughs)

15:49.031 --> 15:50.783
Our dinner will happen
when it happens.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.368
No rush at all.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.911
Thank you for understanding.

15:53.994 --> 15:56.038
-We'll talk later.
-Okay!

15:56.121 --> 16:00.042
Okay, Geoff and I
are definitely in
for tomorrow night.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.879
Harry has a colonoscopy
on Friday morning,

16:03.962 --> 16:05.756
and I completely forgot.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.342
See? I'm not crazy.

16:08.425 --> 16:10.260
You do drop balls
every now and then.

16:10.344 --> 16:14.932
You got me.
Apologies to, to Geoff.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.225
(light R&B playing)

16:16.308 --> 16:19.103
♪ ♪

16:20.145 --> 16:23.732
Uh, sir, I'm not tryin'
to be unreasonable,

16:23.816 --> 16:27.820
but that guy who just
left with the doggy bag
came in after us.

16:27.903 --> 16:30.572
-Am I right about that?
-Yeah, I think so.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.242
With the straw hat?
Um, it's Nya Wallace.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.244
7:30, party of two.
Would you check again?

16:35.327 --> 16:38.080
I'm sorry, again.
We have no record of your
reservation in the system.

16:38.163 --> 16:44.044
But, uh, I do have a record
of the reservation right here.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.754
Mm-hm, yeah,
you've shown me that
already three times,

16:45.838 --> 16:50.592
but see, it's
not in my system.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.469
Okay, well, then let's
just ignore the evidence,

16:52.553 --> 16:54.596
and say I don't
have a reservation.
I mean, it's possible.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.807
I've made mistakes
in my life...

16:56.890 --> 16:58.726
uh, most recently comin'
into this restaurant.

16:58.809 --> 16:59.810
(laughs)

16:59.893 --> 17:02.312
What are we gon'
do about it, though?

17:02.396 --> 17:04.982
You know, there are
a couple of cute places
pretty near here.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.942
Miranda,
I'm 37 minutes
into this trial.

17:07.025 --> 17:08.318
-I am not leaving
without a win.
-Got it. Yeah.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.445
One second.

17:11.571 --> 17:14.116
Found you.
You did make
a 7:30 reservation...

17:14.199 --> 17:17.869
-Thank you.
-...at our San Francisco
location.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.622
Should I call 'em
and tell 'em

17:20.705 --> 17:22.082
we're gonna be
a little bit late?

17:22.165 --> 17:24.292
-I'll get to you.
-Okay, thank you. Thank you.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.044
Sateesh, party of two.

17:26.127 --> 17:29.173
I am so sorry.
That was totally not me.

17:29.256 --> 17:32.301
No, that is so,
usually, exactly me.

17:32.384 --> 17:36.930
I'm just so hopped up
on all these, um,
fertility drugs.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.974
Yeah, it's messin'
with my everything.

17:39.057 --> 17:42.603
Oh, okay.
Yeah, I know how
hard that can be.

17:42.686 --> 17:43.687
Wait, you've been
through this?

17:43.771 --> 17:45.564
Waiter:
Water for you ladies.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.316
Thanks.
You have kids?

17:47.399 --> 17:49.985
No and yes.
No to IVF.

17:50.068 --> 17:53.113
Yes, I have
a 17-year-old son
named Brady.

17:53.197 --> 17:57.701
I have a, a good friend who
went through hell with IVF.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.329
-That's how I know.
-Yeah, well, this is
my second trip to hell.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.372
My, uh, first
one didn't take...

18:03.540 --> 18:06.043
which, uh...

18:06.126 --> 18:08.962
is privileged information
between professor and student,

18:09.046 --> 18:10.714
and, as a reminder,
I do have the power
to fail you.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.759
Oh, not, not
unethical at all.

18:13.842 --> 18:17.012
(laughs)
Um...

18:17.096 --> 18:19.848
and so, this is the part
you tell me where
it'll all be worth it.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.683
Counselor, I think you're
leading the witness.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.852
Miranda Hobbes,
are you about to tell me

18:23.936 --> 18:24.770
that motherhood
isn't worth it?

18:24.853 --> 18:29.066
Um... it depends
on the day.

18:29.149 --> 18:32.069
Like today, when my son
called me a bitch

18:32.152 --> 18:33.028
because I sent
his girlfriend home,

18:33.111 --> 18:35.864
and forced him
to do his homework.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.408
-100% not worth it.
-No. No, it's not worth it.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.202
No. (laughs)

18:40.285 --> 18:42.830
Haven't heard that
side of the argument.
(laughs)

18:42.913 --> 18:43.705
Menu for you.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.707
-But if having a baby is...
-And you.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.377
is really what you want--
Thank you.

18:48.460 --> 18:51.213
It will be way more
than 100% worth it.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.258
Great, but I don't need
a hard sell, right?

18:54.341 --> 18:56.552
I'm gettin' that
from society,
from my friends,

18:56.635 --> 18:58.887
my family, uh,
my house cleaner.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.348
-You need a new house cleaner.
-Yeah.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.978
Okay, here's the thing.

19:06.061 --> 19:09.231
I don't know why
I'm tellin' you this, probably
the hormones but, um...

19:09.314 --> 19:12.860
when my last round of IVF
didn't go through...

19:13.652 --> 19:14.736
um...

19:16.446 --> 19:18.532
I felt a huge
wave of relief.

19:21.326 --> 19:25.414
And listen,
my husband and I,
we love our life.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.917
I mean,
nobody's life is perfect,
but, my life...

19:29.001 --> 19:31.420
is really
fuckin' close, right?

19:31.503 --> 19:32.170
But then, I--

19:34.798 --> 19:37.759
I'm also afraid that if
I don't have a child,

19:37.843 --> 19:39.136
I'm gonna
regret it one day.

19:40.846 --> 19:44.266
You know,
the thing about regret

19:44.349 --> 19:47.436
is that having a child
doesn't take it away.

19:47.519 --> 19:48.186
Thank you.

19:50.355 --> 19:53.817
There are always gonna be
these roads not taken, right?

19:55.193 --> 19:57.738
I mean, I--

19:57.821 --> 20:00.032
There was a woman
in my class at Harvard.

20:00.115 --> 20:03.952
Not a Rhodes Scholar.
She never married.
She never had kids.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.121
She's a federal judge now.

20:06.204 --> 20:08.916
-Who goes home
to an empty house.
-God!

20:10.667 --> 20:12.794
There are so many nights

20:12.878 --> 20:15.464
when I would love
to be a judge,

20:15.547 --> 20:17.132
and go home
to an empty house.

20:19.134 --> 20:19.259
Hmm.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.138
And then,
I see my son
and I'm glad.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.853
And then,
I see his dirty underwear
on my kitchen floor...

20:29.937 --> 20:31.271
-No.
-...and I'm mad.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.023
Yeah, I could see that.

20:35.567 --> 20:39.363
-So you can't have it all?
-No... (sighs)

20:39.446 --> 20:41.240
you can.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.157
It's just really fuckin' hard.

20:46.536 --> 20:47.204
Is that your
closing argument?

20:50.290 --> 20:51.750
Your honor...

20:52.542 --> 20:55.545
if this round
of IVF works...

20:56.546 --> 21:00.509
you're gonna love
motherhood every second.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.178
(laughs)
Why don't we get
another round of drinks?

21:03.261 --> 21:05.180
-(laughs) Why don't we?
-Yeah.

21:05.263 --> 21:08.684
Mmm, I'm not very open
to this open house.

21:08.767 --> 21:12.020
"Mad Max" meets
"Dances With Wolves."

21:12.104 --> 21:14.523
-I think I used to date
the guy who lives here.
-Really?

21:14.606 --> 21:16.858
Well, generally speaking,
I feel like back in the '90s,

21:16.942 --> 21:18.944
we all dated
the 50-year-old guy
who lives here.

21:19.027 --> 21:21.863
I'm still dating them.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.116
By the way,
feel free to introduce me

21:24.199 --> 21:27.202
to any available men that
you know with a good heart.

21:27.285 --> 21:28.704
Even if they're
fixer-uppers.
I can flip 'em.

21:28.787 --> 21:31.373
Oh, I bet you can.

21:31.456 --> 21:35.335
So, the motorcycle
inside is for what?

21:35.419 --> 21:36.378
Those quick trips
to the bathroom?

21:36.461 --> 21:38.714
See, this is why you
don't leave your furniture

21:38.797 --> 21:40.132
in your place
for the open house.

21:40.215 --> 21:42.217
-All right.
-Okay.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.343
I'm gonna say goodbye
to the realtor. Poor thing.

21:51.309 --> 21:54.229
-Great place, huh?
-Oh! Oh god.

21:54.312 --> 21:56.273
I'm considering
making an offer.

21:56.356 --> 21:58.734
Recently divorced,
and I'm movin' back downtown!

21:58.817 --> 21:59.901
(polite chuckle)

21:59.985 --> 22:02.195
You look like
a downtown lady.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.823
-You wanna check
out the bedroom?
-Ooh, oh--

22:04.906 --> 22:08.660
-Let's go. We have to eat.
-Oh, we have to eat.

22:08.744 --> 22:13.331
Ooh, (chuckles)
I was about to flee
on the motorcycle.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.584
-Who was that?
-My worst nightmare.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.377
You think that guy was
your worst nightmare?

22:17.461 --> 22:19.171
-Check out this honey bun.
-Mm!

22:20.714 --> 22:22.883
Profile says
he's looking for fun.

22:22.966 --> 22:25.302
-He should be
looking for a shirt.
-(Seema chuckles)

22:25.385 --> 22:29.848
Wait, please.
There's so many more gems.

22:29.931 --> 22:31.475
How many dating apps
are you on?

22:31.558 --> 22:32.934
How much time have you got?

22:33.018 --> 22:35.228
I started back in the day
with OkCupid...

22:35.312 --> 22:36.772
-Uh-huh.
-...which was not okay.
It was like

22:36.855 --> 22:39.107
are you fucking
with me, Cupid?

22:39.191 --> 22:42.069
Then, I moved to Tinder...

22:42.152 --> 22:44.112
where I met the guy
who cried after sex.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.615
Oh, so he was too Tinder.

22:46.698 --> 22:51.453
I just want someone to create
a dating site that's called,

22:51.536 --> 22:53.789
"Here's the man you've
been searching for, Seema."

22:53.872 --> 22:55.957
And you're never married?
Not divorced?

22:56.041 --> 22:57.793
No, happily not divorced.

22:57.876 --> 23:02.214
Well, I think it's
great that you're still
putting yourself out there.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.299
Yes. Well, I am.

23:04.382 --> 23:06.843
Ooh, do you wanna split
the cacio e pepe?

23:06.927 --> 23:08.345
-Mm-hm.
-Mm.

23:11.640 --> 23:15.852
Lisa and Herbert run in
an eclectic, diverse crowd.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.729
-Hmm.
-But... right now,

23:17.813 --> 23:19.689
everyone is talking
about Black literature.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.483
You read the article
I sent you, right?

23:21.566 --> 23:25.987
-Yep.
-So name a few
modern Black authors

23:26.071 --> 23:29.032
-that every person is reading.
-(exhales)

23:29.116 --> 23:33.161
-Sadie Smith.
-Zadie with a Z.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.164
Can't I just say I love
Michelle Obama's book?

23:36.248 --> 23:38.500
I feel like you
are not taking
this seriously.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.335
Charlotte, I've been
talkin' my whole life.

23:40.418 --> 23:42.546
Think I can handle
a little dinner chit-chat.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.551
-Do I need it?
-No.

23:51.179 --> 23:51.555
Harry!

23:55.225 --> 23:57.853
We lucked out when LTW
canceled the other night,

23:57.936 --> 24:00.856
but that was
our wake-up call.

24:00.939 --> 24:04.442
It is unacceptable that
we do not have a more
diverse friendship circle,

24:04.526 --> 24:06.528
so, tonight,
bring your "A" game.

24:06.611 --> 24:09.489
-Oh god,
you're sweating already.
-Can't imagine why.

24:11.283 --> 24:14.077
-Both: Hi!
-Come on in!

24:14.161 --> 24:15.745
Charlotte:
I know you said not
to bring any gifts,

24:15.829 --> 24:17.914
but we had
to bring Herbert
a little something.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.541
-Aww.
-Harry: It's chocolate.

24:19.624 --> 24:20.584
It's really good
with port,
if he drinks.

24:20.667 --> 24:23.712
Oh, he drinks. He has to.
He's married to this.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.672
Oh.

24:25.755 --> 24:27.799
Uh, I have to go
apologize to the chef

24:27.883 --> 24:30.468
for something my mother-in-law
just said about the appetizers.

24:30.552 --> 24:30.594
You all go mingle.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.850
-Harry: Wow!
-Charlotte: Yes,

24:36.933 --> 24:38.602
(indistinct chatter)

24:40.770 --> 24:42.105
Looks like we're
the eclectic and diverse.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.440
Herbert:
Harry, Charlotte.

24:43.523 --> 24:47.068
-Hey! Happy birthday, big guy.
-Happy birthday!

24:47.152 --> 24:48.278
Please, come join us.

24:48.361 --> 24:51.198
Oh, look.
It's Gwen, Leo's mom.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.242
Hi, Gwen!

24:54.326 --> 24:58.288
Hi!
I haven't seen you since
Leo transferred to Dalton.

24:58.371 --> 24:59.581
I'm not Gwen.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.626
But I know who
you're talking about.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.878
This is Lisa's
friend, Shawna.

25:06.379 --> 25:09.132
Anybody read the new
Zadie Smith book?

in "The Wizard of Oz"

from sepia to color?

25:33.657 --> 25:36.743

25:38.536 --> 25:41.539
totally beige, everywhere.

25:43.124 --> 25:45.252
There's no sign of me.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.461
Sometimes, I look
around this house

25:46.544 --> 25:47.963
and there's...
no sign of me either.

25:48.046 --> 25:51.091

25:58.807 --> 26:01.476
Carrie:
I know... everyone is.

26:01.559 --> 26:05.480
Maybe that's why I'm drawn
to Seema, my realtor, you know?

26:05.563 --> 26:08.108
When I'm with her,
I can just, um...

none of the terrible
stuff has happened.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.405
Well, she didn't know Big.

26:13.488 --> 26:14.990
Carrie:
Exactly.

than my husband,
God rest his soul,

Deborah Roberts,

28:18.696 --> 28:20.907

28:20.990 --> 28:23.326
and the early work
by Derrick Adams,

-And then,
my personal favorite

28:28.415 --> 28:32.293

-The one on your bedside table.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.522
I must've hit it
on the corner,

33:02.605 --> 33:04.524
and it just shattered.

33:04.607 --> 33:06.984
-Why were you even touching it?
-Well, it was a personal item,

33:07.068 --> 33:08.695
and you were supposed
to tuck it away.

33:08.778 --> 33:10.738
-It is a personal item.
-No, I understand.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.908
-But it's only that--
-You said they move Picassos,
that nothing would get broken.

33:13.991 --> 33:17.412
And, unfortunately, this
was my bad, not theirs,

33:17.495 --> 33:19.288
but it can be fixed.

33:19.372 --> 33:21.958
Only the glass is broken,
the photo's intact,

33:22.041 --> 33:24.836
so I'll just
replace the glass.

33:24.919 --> 33:28.172
You can't just
replace the glass.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.425
That picture was
on his side of the bed.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.969
He touched that
glass all the time.

33:33.052 --> 33:36.639
You-- the, the glass
is not replaceable.

33:38.307 --> 33:40.101
Well... I'm sorry.

33:40.184 --> 33:41.102
Well, you don't
seem very sorry.

33:41.185 --> 33:45.481
You're sitting there,
you know, pretty casually.

33:45.565 --> 33:47.775
You know, "Oh, it just--
We'll just replace the glass.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.944
You know, it's not--
No big deal. No worries."

33:50.027 --> 33:52.321
No worries?
He was the,
the love of my life.

33:52.405 --> 33:54.824
Actually... I'm not
like that at all. I--

33:54.907 --> 33:57.785
Well, that's, that's
how it seems to me.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.624
He's gone, it's broken,
and no one can fix it.

34:06.002 --> 34:09.172
I am very sorry, I am.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.966
I assure you,
I had no intention

34:12.049 --> 34:14.385
of being insensitive
to your situation.

34:17.304 --> 34:18.806
(sighs) Sometimes...

34:18.889 --> 34:22.018
people aren't aware
of how insensitive
they may seem...

34:24.687 --> 34:26.022
and, I guess, today that
could apply to me.

34:28.232 --> 34:31.402
Or to you...
at the restaurant
the other day.

34:33.696 --> 34:35.239
Me?
How was I insensitive?

34:37.074 --> 34:39.827
When we were talking
about me dating, you said
something like--

34:39.911 --> 34:41.661
Well, no, it wasn't
"something like."

34:41.746 --> 34:45.583
I... remember
exactly what it was.
You said...

34:45.666 --> 34:54.675
"Well, it's great you're still
putting yourself out there.

34:54.759 --> 34:55.885
"Good for you, Seema,
trying to find yourself a man

34:55.967 --> 34:59.806
to marry after all
those years of no luck."

34:59.889 --> 35:01.390
No, no, that's not
the way I meant it.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.851
You know, I'm sure,
but that's how I heard it.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.233
If I'm being really honest...

35:10.316 --> 35:11.859
maybe you have
a point, Carrie.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.028
Maybe there's
a little part of me

35:14.111 --> 35:16.864
that doesn't feel
sorry for you...

35:16.948 --> 35:19.200
'cause at least you found
the love of your life

35:19.283 --> 35:22.453
and you had him for
many wonderful years,
and in my eyes,

35:22.537 --> 35:26.415
that is something worth still
putting yourself out there for.

35:29.585 --> 35:31.128
I agree.

35:39.887 --> 35:42.557
Would you like some yellowtail?

35:43.349 --> 35:45.726
Is it from the place
on Madison?

35:45.810 --> 35:49.689
(both laughing)

35:49.772 --> 35:51.732
(indistinct chatter)

35:51.816 --> 35:54.068
Carrie:
And just like that...

35:54.152 --> 35:56.320
we began our real friendship.
