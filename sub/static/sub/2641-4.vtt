WEBVTT

00:04.066 --> 00:06.586
This movie baffles me
every time we watch it.

00:07.134 --> 00:08.109
What do you mean?

00:08.164 --> 00:09.766
The instructions are very clear:

00:09.886 --> 00:11.629
"don't feed the gremlins
after midnight."

00:13.368 --> 00:15.193
"don't get the gremlins wet."

00:17.985 --> 00:19.231
How hard is that?

00:20.065 --> 00:21.618
(door opening)

00:21.858 --> 00:22.918
Hi, guys.

00:23.044 --> 00:23.994
Hi, honey.

00:24.090 --> 00:24.893
Hey.

00:24.972 --> 00:26.237
Ooh, we're "hoy" now, are we?

00:26.335 --> 00:28.952
Yes. Since their relationship
became carnal,

00:29.014 --> 00:31.485
Penny has upgraded his
designated term of endearment,

00:31.590 --> 00:34.309
Thus distinguishing him
from those she calls "sweetie,"

00:34.370 --> 00:37.077
Usually in an attempt to soften
a thinly-veiled insult.

00:38.597 --> 00:40.459
You're boring people
sweetie.

00:42.222 --> 00:44.629
Although, sometimes,
she omits the veil entirely.

00:45.762 --> 00:47.409
So, what are
you guys doing?

00:47.493 --> 00:49.120
Celebrating
columbus day.

00:49.197 --> 00:51.491
<i>We're watching goonies, gremlins
and young sherlock holmes.</i>

00:52.443 --> 00:54.706
They're all written
by chris cumbus.

00:56.577 --> 00:57.634
Okay.

00:57.697 --> 00:59.566
What do you watch
on thanksgiving?

00:59.635 --> 01:00.994
The parade.

01:02.871 --> 01:04.208
Oh, you know,
that reminds me--

01:04.272 --> 01:05.940
I usually go back to
nebraska for thanksgiving,

01:06.019 --> 01:07.258
But this year they're
calling it off

01:07.305 --> 01:08.934
On account of my
brother's trial.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.055
What's he on trial for?

01:11.142 --> 01:12.943
Oh, just a big
misunderstanding.

01:13.019 --> 01:14.579
You know, you'd actually
li my brother.

01:14.629 --> 01:16.001
He's kind of
a chemist.

01:19.583 --> 01:21.051
Anyway, I was thinking
I'd have thanksgiving he,

01:21.117 --> 01:22.516
And you are all invited.

01:22.610 --> 01:23.885
Oh. I'll be there.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.674
Will you be serving
cranberry jelly

01:25.732 --> 01:27.243
Or cranberry sauce?

01:28.106 --> 01:29.727
I guess I could
serve both.

01:29.827 --> 01:32.604
You guess? I don't seem to
have much of a handle on this.

01:35.179 --> 01:37.360
Yeah, I really wish I could,
penny, but every year,

01:37.403 --> 01:39.912
Mother has all the
relatives over and cooks up

01:39.960 --> 01:41.633
Her famous tur-briska-fil.

01:43.195 --> 01:44.584
Tur-briska-fil?

01:44.666 --> 01:47.398
Turkey stuffed with a brisket
stuffed with gefilte fish.

01:50.103 --> 01:51.665
It's not as good as it sounds.

01:53.585 --> 01:54.699
Raj, what about you?

01:54.787 --> 01:56.880
Oh, he usually comes
to my house. Right, pal?

02:01.812 --> 02:03.067
All right, this year,
you don't have to

02:03.133 --> 02:04.869
Eat the
tur-briska-fil.

02:05.968 --> 02:06.787
(chuckles)

02:06.878 --> 02:07.949
I don't even chew it.

02:08.031 --> 02:09.314
I swallow it like pills.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:36.604 --> 02:37.825
So, what's going on
with raj?

02:38.347 --> 02:39.793
Well, the good news is,

02:39.919 --> 02:42.262
He has no problem
with my mother's tur-brka-fil.

02:43.755 --> 02:45.031
Hard to believe,
but go on.

02:46.405 --> 02:49.052
The bad news is,
he says he'getting deported.

02:49.354 --> 02:50.200
Leonard:
What do you mean,

02:50.275 --> 02:51.234
He's getting deported?

02:51.308 --> 02:52.569
I believe it means
that the u.S. Government

02:52.609 --> 02:54.256
Is going to expel him
from the country.

02:55.316 --> 02:56.758
He could then either return
to his native india,

02:56.835 --> 02:59.175
Emigrate to another country
that's willing to accept him

02:59.280 --> 03:01.836
Or wander the high seas
as a stateless pirate.

03:05.816 --> 03:07.029
Personally, I'd choose pirate.

03:09.283 --> 03:10.421
Penny, would you mind
stepping outside

03:10.482 --> 03:11.744
So we can speak to him?

03:11.819 --> 03:13.566
(groans)
fine.

03:13.619 --> 03:16.305
But the man really needs to work
on his girl issues.

03:16.415 --> 03:18.638
Another reason to consider
life of piracy.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.077
Even today, I understand
that's an all-male profession.

03:24.505 --> 03:25.336
Okay, she's go.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.433
Sorry.
I lost my cool.

03:34.192 --> 03:35.757
So, what's going on?

03:35.836 --> 03:37.453
Okay, here's the deal:

03:37.566 --> 03:39.564
Six months ago, my
research testing

03:39.646 --> 03:42.175
The predicted composition
of trans-neptunian objects

03:42.224 --> 03:43.829
Ran into a dead end.

03:43.888 --> 03:45.906
So?
So, my visa's only good

03:45.982 --> 03:49.138
Aand when they find out
at I've got squat,

03:49.195 --> 03:50.353
They're going to cut me off.

03:51.153 --> 03:53.504
By the way, when I say squat,
I mean diddly-squat.

03:55.112 --> 03:56.986
I wish I had squat.

03:58.607 --> 04:01.139
So, wait, what have you been
doing for the past six months?

04:01.196 --> 04:03.091
You know, checking e-mail,

04:04.200 --> 04:05.484
Updating my facebook status,

04:06.310 --> 04:08.098
Messing up wikipedia entries.

04:10.443 --> 04:11.723
Hey, did you know netflix

04:11.789 --> 04:13.267
Lets you stream movies
on your computer now?

04:14.518 --> 04:16.493
And you've continued
to take the universit's money

04:16.591 --> 04:18.108
Under false pretenses?

04:18.192 --> 04:20.281
Highly unethical
for an astrophysicist.

04:21.166 --> 04:22.689
Although pctically mandatory
for a pirate.

04:25.376 --> 04:26.612
I don't want to go back
to india.

04:26.710 --> 04:30.251
It's hot and loud,
and there's so many people.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.200
You have no idea--
they're everywhere.

04:35.766 --> 04:37.548
Okay, guys, think.

04:37.639 --> 04:39.133
How do we keep raj
in the country?

04:43.955 --> 04:46.375
Penny: Why doesn't
he just get another job?

04:52.675 --> 04:53.909
What are you
asking me for?

04:53.965 --> 04:56.098
I don't know if you
can talk now or not.

05:01.939 --> 05:02.734
Oh, beef...

05:02.873 --> 05:04.634
I'm going to miss
you so much.

05:06.707 --> 05:07.890
Do you know,
at the mumbai mcdonald's,

05:07.981 --> 05:09.376
You can't get a big mac?

05:09.485 --> 05:11.650
All you can get
is a chicken maharaja mac.

05:12.650 --> 05:13.867
And the special sauce--

05:13.989 --> 05:16.067
Curry-- which, in india,
believe you me,

05:16.138 --> 05:17.430
Is really not that special.

05:19.193 --> 05:21.132
Don't worry,
you'll find another job.

05:21.213 --> 05:22.984
Yeah let me start
practicing for it.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.871
"do you want fries with
that maharaja mac?"

05:26.707 --> 05:27.918
Sheldon:
Hi, leonard.

05:27.998 --> 05:29.025
Hello, raj.

05:29.138 --> 05:30.491
Hello sheldon.

05:31.384 --> 05:34.440
Forgive me, as you know, I'm no
adept at reading facial cues,

05:34.512 --> 05:35.929
But I'm going
to take a stab here:

05:36.048 --> 05:38.515
You're either sad or nauseated.

05:39.606 --> 05:40.951
I'm sad.

05:41.015 --> 05:42.071
I was going to say sad.

05:42.143 --> 05:43.451
I don't know why I hedged.

05:45.606 --> 05:46.442
What are you eating?

05:46.515 --> 05:49.543
Elbow macaroni with ground
hamburger and tomato sauce.

05:49.667 --> 05:51.505
Oh, beefaroni.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.815
I think I'll miss you
most of all.

05:55.254 --> 05:56.805
I've always been
a little confused about this.

05:56.887 --> 05:58.497
Why don't hindus eat beef?

05:58.554 --> 05:59.945
We believe cows are gods.

05:59.935 --> 06:00.917
Not technically.

06:01.039 --> 06:03.358
<i>In hinduism, cattle are
thought to be like god.</i>

06:03.557 --> 06:05.704
Do not tell me about
my own culture, sheldon!

06:05.759 --> 06:07.954
In the mood I'm in, I'll take
you out-- I swear to cow!

06:10.883 --> 06:12.145
I'm sorry.

06:12.275 --> 06:13.560
Me, too.

06:13.662 --> 06:15.021
I'm st...
I'm a little on edge.

06:15.001 --> 06:15.811
Understandable.

06:16.330 --> 06:18.089
Your entire life seems
to be crumbling around you,

06:18.192 --> 06:19.749
And your future
appears bleak at bt.

06:19.817 --> 06:22.449
Thank you.

06:22.537 --> 06:24.133
And you're wrong
about hinduism and cows.

06:25.722 --> 06:27.407
Hey, raj, guess what.

06:27.497 --> 06:28.934
Professor laughlin
is looking for someone to join

06:29.008 --> 06:30.636
The stellar evolution
research team.

06:30.726 --> 06:35.159
You-you're kidding!
That's fantastic!
What are you waiting for? Call
him and set up an interview.

06:35.231 --> 06:36.100
I'm on it.

06:36.591 --> 06:37.714
That's happy, right?

06:37.814 --> 06:38.770
Yeah.
Nailed it.

06:41.415 --> 06:43.084
Dr. Koothrappali, come on in.

06:43.158 --> 06:44.891
I was surprised to here
you were interested

06:44.967 --> 06:46.327
In joining our little team.

06:46.658 --> 06:48.950
Giving up on those
trans-neptunian objects, are we?

06:49.047 --> 06:50.922
No, no; it's a very
promising area.

06:51.006 --> 06:53.515
I'd spend several
more years on it.Ld,

06:53.611 --> 06:55.205
But I just couldn'pass up
the opportunity

06:55.306 --> 06:57.442
To work wi you
on your tremendously exciting

06:57.525 --> 07:00.083
And not yet conclusively
disproved hypothesis.

07:01.025 --> 07:01.861
Splendid.

07:01.933 --> 07:03.280
Uh, please sit down.

07:03.372 --> 07:04.943
Can I offer you
a sherry?

07:05.016 --> 07:06.614
It's a little
early, isn't it?

07:06.675 --> 07:08.459
Not on proxima centauri.

07:08.514 --> 07:09.581
(chuckles)

07:09.633 --> 07:10.788
(laughing):
That's very good.

07:10.898 --> 07:13.006
Jolly amusing,
but if you don't mind,

07:13.107 --> 07:15.295
I'll hold off
until sunset on titan.

07:16.504 --> 07:17.237
(laughs)
well done.

07:17.285 --> 07:18.551
I have a fling you're going

07:18.612 --> 07:20.207
To fit in just fine,
dr. Koothrappali.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.365
Thank you, sir.

07:21.448 --> 07:22.564
(knock at door)

07:23.367 --> 07:24.109
I'm sorry.

07:24.202 --> 07:25.312
Am I late?

07:25.371 --> 07:26.455
No, no, no.
Right on time.

07:26.537 --> 07:28.176
Dr. Koothrappali,
may I present

07:28.226 --> 07:30.072
Dr. Millstone from MIT.

07:30.156 --> 07:32.317
She'll be heading up
our data analysis team.

07:32.428 --> 07:34.454
It's nice to meet you,
dr. Koothrappali.

07:35.857 --> 07:38.807
I read your paper on kuiper belt
object size distribution.

07:38.922 --> 07:40.787
I really enjoy it.

07:44.972 --> 07:47.288
How did you correct
for the selection bias?

07:47.407 --> 07:50.990
Well, I ran a simulation
that allowed me

07:51.067 --> 07:53.233
To correct for the
observational efficiency.

07:53.315 --> 07:55.283
That's just fascinating.

07:55.616 --> 07:56.466
Thank you.

07:58.303 --> 08:01.204
Would you like to hear
more about it in my hot tub?

08:05.824 --> 08:07.054
So, when do I start?

08:11.325 --> 08:12.777
What do you mean you
didn't get the job?

08:12.852 --> 08:13.932
How could you
not get it?

08:14.814 --> 08:18.076
U know... He's british;
I'm indian.

08:18.921 --> 08:21.307
Ever since gandhi,
they haven't liked us very much.

08:22.755 --> 08:25.092
Wait, are you saying that
he discriminated against you?

08:25.175 --> 08:26.551
Because we should
file a complaint.

08:26.665 --> 08:27.625
That's okay.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.218
A complaint ha's been filed.

08:31.727 --> 08:32.418
So, that's it.

08:32.544 --> 08:34.106
That was my last hope.

08:34.192 --> 08:35.626
I'm going
to be deported,

08:36.299 --> 08:37.335
Sent home in disgrace,

08:37.403 --> 08:40.578
Exposed to the sardonic barb
of my cousin sanjay.

08:40.649 --> 08:43.150
Or, as you may know him,
dave from at&t customer service.

08:50.520 --> 08:51.463
I'm really going
to miss you.

08:51.539 --> 08:53.299
Will you come visit me
in India?

08:54.672 --> 08:56.534
Gee, that's, like,
a 17-hour flight.

08:57.549 --> 08:59.041
How about I meet
you halfway?

08:59.160 --> 09:01.302
Halfway is 600 miles
off the coast of japan.

09:02.067 --> 09:03.863
Tell you what,
we'll skype.

09:07.938 --> 09:08.838
Gentlemen.

09:08.909 --> 09:10.104
Leonard:
Hey.
Raj,

09:10.175 --> 09:12.071
Did you get the job
with professor laughlin?

09:12.143 --> 09:14.004
No.
I assumed as much.

09:14.105 --> 09:15.093
But never fear.

09:15.205 --> 09:16.727
Like the subordinate
male protagonist

09:16.811 --> 09:18.200
In countless action movies

09:18.259 --> 09:20.387
Who disappears half way
through the second reel,

09:20.462 --> 09:22.377
I have returned to save the day.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.116
Odd.

09:27.180 --> 09:28.618
Usually, he's met by cheers.

09:29.583 --> 09:30.372
Anyway,

09:30.422 --> 09:31.569
I was thinking about exploring

09:31.668 --> 09:32.997
The string theory implications

09:33.072 --> 09:35.573
Of gamma rays from
dark matter annihilations,

09:35.651 --> 09:37.080
And it occurred to me
that I could benefit--

09:37.149 --> 09:38.011
Excuse me, sheldon.

09:38.088 --> 09:39.775
How many reels before
the subordine male protagonist

09:39.836 --> 09:41.327
Gets to his point?

09:41.406 --> 09:43.284
I'm sorry-- if you didn't
cheer at my entrance,

09:43.381 --> 09:44.727
It's too late
to buy into the premise.

09:47.973 --> 09:49.773
Anyway, I got
some extra money

09:49.875 --> 09:51.214
From the head of
the department,

09:51.294 --> 09:53.538
And raj can come
work for me.

09:54.901 --> 09:55.980
<i>You want me
to work with you?</i>

09:56.879 --> 09:58.098
<i>For me.</i>

09:58.962 --> 10:00.136
You're going to
have to listen

10:00.222 --> 10:01.697
More careful when
you're on the job.

10:02.924 --> 10:05.182
Ay, uh, please don't take this
the wrong way,

10:05.251 --> 10:08.267
But I'd rather swim buck-naked
across the ganges

10:08.397 --> 10:09.878
With a paper cut on my nipple

10:10.638 --> 10:12.600
And die a slow,
agonizing death

10:12.669 --> 10:15.056
From a viral infection
than work with you.

10:17.073 --> 10:18.267
<i>For me.</i>

10:26.288 --> 10:27.134
(knock at door)

10:28.706 --> 10:29.770
Sheldon, are you busy?

10:29.853 --> 10:31.828
Of course I'm busy.

10:32.826 --> 10:34.115
Shall I wait?

10:48.438 --> 10:49.651
How may I help you?

10:51.437 --> 10:54.096
I've reconsider your offer
to let me work with you.

10:54.203 --> 10:55.833
<i>For me</i>

10:57.004 --> 10:58.438
<i>Yes, for you.</i>

10:58.542 --> 11:00.722
I do, however, have
a few conditions.

11:00.809 --> 11:02.318
First, at all times,

11:02.428 --> 11:04.451
I am to be treated
as a colleague and an equal.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.405
Second, my contributions
shall be noted

11:06.480 --> 11:07.619
In all published material.

11:07.679 --> 11:09.799
And third, you are never allowed
to lecture me

11:09.878 --> 11:11.738
On hinduism
or my indian culture.

11:13.632 --> 11:14.994
I'm impressed, raj.

11:15.390 --> 11:17.443
Those are very cogent
and reasonable conditions.

11:17.795 --> 11:18.692
Thank you.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.677
Then you leave me no choice.

11:22.794 --> 11:24.322
I accept the job.

11:26.159 --> 11:28.575
I'm sorry, I believe
you've misunderstood.

11:28.651 --> 11:30.357
I'm not giving you the job.

11:30.448 --> 11:33.560
I'm simply affording you
the opportunity to apply for it.

11:36.049 --> 11:37.773
Have a seat; we'll get started
with the interview.

11:37.882 --> 11:40.059
Wha... You're kidding!

11:40.880 --> 11:41.744
Please.

11:43.700 --> 11:44.641
(sighs)
all right.

11:44.774 --> 11:47.017
(annoyed sigh)

11:47.116 --> 11:48.774
So... (sighs)

11:51.253 --> 11:53.753
That's what you wear
to an interview?

11:55.431 --> 11:57.364
Come on, dude,
we've been friends for years.

11:57.443 --> 11:59.588
Oh, pulling strings, are we?

12:01.147 --> 12:03.882
Sheldon, for god's sakes,
don't make me beg.

12:04.551 --> 12:06.031
Bazinga!

12:07.075 --> 12:08.376
You've fallen victim

12:08.456 --> 12:10.713
To another one
of my classic practical jokes.

12:13.116 --> 12:15.597
I'm your boss now.
You may want to laugh at that.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.855
Ah, nice having the
place to ourselves, isn't it?

12:23.202 --> 12:23.993
Uh-huh.

12:24.330 --> 12:25.665
Now that raj is
working for sheldon,

12:25.763 --> 12:27.391
I don't have to chauffeur
him around anymore.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.507
Plus, yeah, with them
working late so much,

12:29.574 --> 12:30.973
We get some privacy.

12:31.055 --> 12:32.107
Mm-hmm.

12:33.804 --> 12:36.786
Hey, want to get a little crazy?

12:37.584 --> 12:38.752
What are you thinking?

12:38.835 --> 12:41.550
Let's slide over to
sheldon's spot a make out.

12:44.867 --> 12:46.695
You are a dirty girl.

12:49.229 --> 12:50.252
(knocking on door)

12:50.334 --> 12:51.731
Oh, god, how did he know?

12:52.734 --> 12:53.923
Hello.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.151
Hi, howard.
(wry laugh)

12:56.244 --> 12:57.552
Am I interrupting?

12:57.668 --> 12:59.149
Little bit, yeah.

12:59.311 --> 13:00.829
Guess I should have called.

13:00.964 --> 13:02.200
Yeah, maybe.

13:02.316 --> 13:03.524
(sighs)

13:03.658 --> 13:05.527
(clicking tongue)

13:10.464 --> 13:12.775
Tonight's the night
I usually go line dancing

13:12.895 --> 13:14.506
With raj at the palomino.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.192
Uh-huh.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.412
But he's working with sheldon.

13:19.508 --> 13:20.709
Yes, we know.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.000
Want me to leave?

13:23.971 --> 13:25.224
You know, whatever.

13:26.175 --> 13:27.971
Okay, I guess I can hang
for a little while.

13:30.069 --> 13:31.924
So what are we watching?

13:32.706 --> 13:34.475
<i>Sex and the city.
Yikes.</i>

13:34.613 --> 13:37.472
Hey, I happen
to love this movie.

13:37.449 --> 13:38.895
Fine, let's watch it.

13:39.384 --> 13:42.219
Maybe all our periods
will synchronize.

13:46.873 --> 13:48.987
All right, we're going to
be designing an experiment

13:49.129 --> 13:50.860
To look
for the nihilation spectrum

13:50.969 --> 13:53.099
Resulting from dark matter
collisions in space.

13:53.839 --> 13:55.396
Ooh, dark matter.

13:55.486 --> 13:57.023
We better bring
a flashlight.

13:57.106 --> 13:58.652
(chuckles)

14:00.375 --> 14:01.617
I was making a joke.

14:01.667 --> 14:02.812
I'm the boss.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.165
I make the jokes.

14:06.314 --> 14:07.992
Sorry
go ahead and make your joke.

14:08.095 --> 14:09.614
This is not the
time for joking.

14:11.128 --> 14:12.450
We're doing
serious research,

14:12.554 --> 14:14.319
Which requires complete
and utter focus.

14:14.439 --> 14:16.648
All right,
let's buckle down and work.

14:17.294 --> 14:19.182
("eye of the tiger"
by survivor playing)

14:47.510 --> 14:48.831
Sheldon.
What?

14:48.894 --> 14:49.959
I need an aspirin.

14:50.050 --> 14:51.080
Top desk drawer.

14:58.563 --> 14:59.674
Thank you.
Alright?

14:59.734 --> 15:00.795
Yes.
Good.

15:00.824 --> 15:03.218
("eye of the tiger" resumes)

15:09.652 --> 15:10.863
That was fun.

15:11.556 --> 15:12.543
Thank you.

15:12.644 --> 15:14.461
Leonard, honey, you don't
have to say thank you

15:14.536 --> 15:15.860
Every time we have sex.

15:15.944 --> 15:17.389
Oh. Okay.

15:18.234 --> 15:20.410
Tomorrow you're going to
get a card in the mail.

15:20.468 --> 15:21.736
Just throw it away.

15:21.839 --> 15:23.652
(clattering)

15:25.202 --> 15:27.192
(in irish brogue):
Top o' the mornin'o ya!

15:30.140 --> 15:31.691
What are you doing here?

15:31.802 --> 15:34.237
Well, usually, on Sundays,
I go with raj

15:34.323 --> 15:36.640
To scam on hippie chicks
at the farmers market,

15:36.753 --> 15:39.629
But he's still working
with sheldon,

15:39.713 --> 15:40.919
So I thought I'd come over here

15:41.035 --> 15:42.711
And make you guys
scrambled eggs and salami.

15:43.498 --> 15:47.874
<i>It's the perfect meal
for aprÃƒÂ¨s l'amour.</i>

15:48.902 --> 15:51.385
Oh, kill me.

15:51.461 --> 15:54.252
By the way, I couldn't help
overhearing your big finish.

15:54.316 --> 15:55.838
Bravo, leonard.

15:59.127 --> 16:01.123
See, if you had killed me
when I said "kill me,"

16:01.200 --> 16:02.427
I wouldn't have had
to hear that.
(stammers)

16:03.419 --> 16:04.575
What do you guys think?

16:04.649 --> 16:05.769
Want to take
in a matinee,

16:05.837 --> 16:07.081
Maybe go
rollerblading,

16:07.143 --> 16:08.195
Catch a step class?

16:09.355 --> 16:10.924
Do something.

16:11.002 --> 16:12.052
Okay.

16:12.109 --> 16:14.497
Um, howard, we
need to talk.

16:14.587 --> 16:16.305
Sure. 'sup, holmes?

16:17.564 --> 16:19.712
Uh... Please understand

16:19.820 --> 16:21.953
That it's not that we
don't want you around,

16:22.043 --> 16:24.429
But Penny and I
occasionally need some...

16:25.807 --> 16:26.732
Alone time.

16:28.389 --> 16:29.155
Oh.

16:30.737 --> 16:33.574
I-I get it, I'm the third wheel.

16:33.656 --> 16:34.576
(chuckles)

16:34.668 --> 16:36.079
Sorry, i should have seen that.

16:36.166 --> 16:37.477
I'll get out
of your way.

16:40.404 --> 16:41.132
Uh, you're gonna want

16:41.211 --> 16:42.854
To eat those eggs
while they're still hot.

16:42.949 --> 16:44.069
Thank you.

16:45.610 --> 16:48.693
There's loand cream cheese
in the fridge.

16:48.777 --> 16:50.018
The bagels are in the oven.

16:53.334 --> 16:56.118
That's great.

16:56.256 --> 16:58.380
I'm just going to hang out
with my mom

16:58.434 --> 16:59.717
That's always fun

17:01.383 --> 17:02.537
Good.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.305
Are we terrible people?

17:11.375 --> 17:12.301
I don't know.

17:13.086 --> 17:14.050
What do you
want me to do?

17:14.119 --> 17:15.613
(stammers)

17:15.730 --> 17:17.656
G-get him;
bring him back.

17:17.708 --> 17:19.329
Are you sure?

17:19.424 --> 17:22.099
Yeah.     Okay.

17:22.464 --> 17:23.378
Howard come back.

17:23.454 --> 17:25.271
Oh, you guys had me scared
for a minute.

17:29.369 --> 17:30.396
No, no, no, no!

17:30.460 --> 17:31.556
That rate is much too low

17:31.631 --> 17:33.058
From what we'd expect
from this collision.

17:33.139 --> 17:33.985
Do you understand

17:34.084 --> 17:35.041
We're talking
about dark matter

17:35.130 --> 17:36.816
Colliding in outer space?

17:36.890 --> 17:38.213
Of course I understand.

17:38.310 --> 17:40.443
<i>And who are you to tell me
about outer space?</i>

17:40.499 --> 17:41.902
I'm the astrophysicist.

17:42.101 --> 17:43.326
"astro" means "space."

17:44.665 --> 17:45.992
"astor" means "star."

17:47.428 --> 17:48.785
Okay, well, let
me just tell you,

17:48.878 --> 17:50.083
If we we having
this argument

17:50.149 --> 17:52.098
In my native language,
I'd be kicking your butt.

17:53.809 --> 17:55.417
<i>English is
your native language.</i>

17:58.032 --> 18:00.084
Okay, you got me there, but
you're wrong about this!

18:01.265 --> 18:03.585
There is a fine line
between wrong and visionary.

18:03.678 --> 18:05.624
Unfortunately you have to be
a visionary to see it.

18:07.311 --> 18:09.455
My god, you think
that every thought

18:09.569 --> 18:11.358
That comes out of your
head is pure gold.

18:11.449 --> 18:12.541
Well, let me tell
you something.

18:12.621 --> 18:14.231
Some of those thoughts
are pure caca.

18:14.323 --> 18:15.302
Caca

18:16.146 --> 18:17.192
It means "doo-doo."

18:17.272 --> 18:18.541
All right!

18:19.191 --> 18:20.573
First of all,
dr. Koothrappali,

18:20.663 --> 18:22.373
When I first proposed
that you work with me..

18:22.452 --> 18:24.299
Aha! So I am
working with you.

18:24.386 --> 18:26.688
In this context,
"with me" means for me."

18:27.591 --> 18:28.654
Ah, well, in
this context...

18:28.773 --> 18:30.885
Oh!

18:31.793 --> 18:33.537
If I'm wrong,
prove it.

18:33.642 --> 18:34.733
Okay.

18:34.856 --> 18:38.544
Here's where we derivthe mass
of the dark matter particle.

18:39.182 --> 18:40.675
You've misstated the
atomic weight of the target.

18:40.784 --> 18:42.174
Let me finish.
You're defacing  work.

18:42.265 --> 18:43.919
I'm not defacing it,
I'm fixing it.

18:44.038 --> 18:45.682
Give me the eraser.
No.

18:45.779 --> 18:47.245
I said give it to me.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.936
Come and get it.

18:50.414 --> 18:51.681
Fine.

18:55.242 --> 18:56.415
Oh, lord.

18:58.700 --> 18:59.909
Dr. Koothrappali,

18:59.986 --> 19:02.546
As your superior, I forbid you
from writing on my board!

19:02.618 --> 19:04.014
You are not my superior.

19:04.109 --> 19:05.499
I am in every way.

19:05.559 --> 19:06.500
Oh, yeah?

19:06.587 --> 19:07.706
Can you do this?

19:12.783 --> 19:14.002
Nice working with you.

19:17.064 --> 19:19.198
<i>I'm sorry-- for you.</i>

19:40.412 --> 19:41.101
Raj...

19:41.383 --> 19:43.715
Raj... Raj...

19:46.357 --> 19:47.184
I'm busy.

19:47.474 --> 19:48.351
Doing what?

19:52.042 --> 19:53.402
All right,
you've made your point.

19:53.471 --> 19:54.595
What do you want, sheldon?

19:54.697 --> 19:55.957
I looked overr the board

19:56.042 --> 19:57.498
And it turns out
you were right.

19:58.263 --> 19:59.765
So you were wrong.
I didn't say that.

19:59.852 --> 20:01.100
That's the only
logical inference.

20:01.197 --> 20:02.543
Nevertheless,
I didn't say it.

20:04.156 --> 20:06.909
Anyway, I would like you to come
back and work for me.

20:07.035 --> 20:09.050
<i>For you or with you?</i>

20:10.089 --> 20:13.157
In this context "for me"
could mean "with me."

20:13.658 --> 20:14.800
All right, but I have
some conditions.

20:14.862 --> 20:16.248
I reject them all.
I'll take the job.

20:18.209 --> 20:19.434
See you Monday.

20:19.555 --> 20:22.137
Wait, you have
to drive me home.

20:22.232 --> 20:23.643
How did you get here?
I walked.

20:23.779 --> 20:24.884
So walk home.
I can't.

20:24.964 --> 20:26.590
There's a big dog outside.

20:31.875 --> 20:33.646
On the way home,
we can start thinking

20:33.717 --> 20:35.417
About methods
of optimizing the detector

20:35.507 --> 20:37.476
For 500 gev particles.

20:37.530 --> 20:38.660
All right.
