00:01.376 --> 00:02.957
CARTER:
Previously on Eureka...

00:03.086 --> 00:05.873
Jo, Fargo, Henry,
Allison and |

00:06.006 --> 00:08.873
were transported
through a wormhole
back to 1947.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.375
We returned
to a reality identical
to the one that we left.

00:11.512 --> 00:12.922
Well, almost identical.

00:13.055 --> 00:14.044
Hey.

00:14.223 --> 00:15.884
HENRY:
l was naive to think
I could just

00:16.016 --> 00:17.381
jump into this marriage.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.598
GRACE: We hit a...
HENRY: Bit of a...

00:18.727 --> 00:19.682
Tough time.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.312
For a while.
But it made us
appreciate...

00:24.316 --> 00:25.522
ZANE: Me marry you?

00:26.026 --> 00:27.015
In what universe?

00:27.819 --> 00:30.105
I'm over us.
I'm done.

00:30.239 --> 00:32.651
ZANE:
You had my grandmother's
engagement ring.

00:32.783 --> 00:34.569
Tell me what we were
to each other.

00:34.701 --> 00:35.986
JO: Nothing.

00:37.996 --> 00:39.861
Then why didn't that
feel like a first kiss?

00:39.998 --> 00:42.455
JO: What's going on
with you and Allison?
Don't deny it.

00:42.584 --> 00:43.994
CARTER: We took
the plunge.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.743
CARTER:
l'm head over heels
in love with you

00:46.880 --> 00:48.996
and l have been
since the day we met.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.936
(GRUNTS)

01:14.950 --> 01:17.111
Who invented
the bow tie, anyway?

01:17.244 --> 01:18.859
They originated
during the Prussian war.

01:18.996 --> 01:22.784
The Croatian mercenaries
wore scarves around...

01:22.916 --> 01:23.871
You don't really care.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.366
No. Not unless you know
how to tie one.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.584
Yeah, well, yikes.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.961
Hello, handsome men.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.455
Oh, hi.
Hello.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.674
Uh, the bride needs you.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.386
Pre—wedding jitters.
You're kidding me.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.972
And I'd hurry.
The guests
will be here soon.

01:42.728 --> 01:43.717
Okay.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.067
Vince?

01:53.655 --> 01:54.986
She's in the powder room.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.271
Thanks.

01:58.577 --> 02:01.865
Hey, boss, anything
I can do to help
smooth things along?

02:01.997 --> 02:03.953
No, sit tight,
Andy, I got this one.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.413
Okay.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.637
I hear we're having
bridal issues.

02:21.558 --> 02:22.889
Cold feet.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.430
Seriously?

02:27.981 --> 02:29.846
Well, don't look at me.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.233
Talk to the bride.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.822
SARAH, you can't
have cold feet.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.451
You don't even have feet.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.859
SARAH: Technically
you're correct,
Sheriff Carter,

02:42.996 --> 02:46.363
but the impending ceremony
has hyper—stimulated
my anxiety programming.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.831
Oh, this is
beyond ridiculous.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.745
Listen, we have
talked about this.

02:49.878 --> 02:52.961
Studying the interaction
of two emotionally
enabled Al's

02:53.090 --> 02:55.331
is an incredible
opportunity for
neuro—computing.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.756
We can learn a lot
without me having
to rent a tux.

03:00.889 --> 03:01.844
No, I don't
want to talk to...

03:01.973 --> 03:04.589
Please. Please.

03:05.477 --> 03:06.466
Please.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.473
(CHUCKLES)

03:10.982 --> 03:11.971
Pfft!

03:14.820 --> 03:16.981
SARAH, um...

03:18.990 --> 03:21.322
Andy is a great guy.

03:21.785 --> 03:25.824
And you two were
made for each other.

03:25.956 --> 03:26.991
Aw.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.957
You were actually
made for each other.

03:31.962 --> 03:35.295
SARAH, just tell us
what you're feeling exactly.

03:35.424 --> 03:38.712
SARAH: I'm feeling as if
I don't know ifl love him.

03:40.679 --> 03:41.964
JO: Called it off?

03:42.681 --> 03:44.046
If two machines
can't make it work,

03:44.182 --> 03:45.433
what hope do
the rest of us have?

03:45.559 --> 03:47.845
I'm just glad
she finally came
to her senses.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.515
Really? I thought
everyone in this place
was dying to study

03:50.647 --> 03:51.932
a happy little
computer couple.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.851
SARAH's just a machine
to these people.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.019
As the father
of the bride...

03:55.152 --> 03:57.234
Well, the programmer
of the bride,

03:57.362 --> 03:59.853
everything happened
just too fast for me.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.402
Well, maybe
that's the secret.

04:02.534 --> 04:03.614
If you know
someone too well,

04:03.744 --> 04:04.859
youllnever
taketheleap.

04:04.995 --> 04:05.984
ZANE: Hey, Lupo.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.828
I guess we won't
get a chance to dance
at that wedding after all.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.037
Mmm.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.374
That's probably
better, though.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.834
You probably wouldn't be
able to keep your hands
to yourself, right?

04:14.963 --> 04:17.249
Don't you have
work to do?

04:17.382 --> 04:20.089
Say, an ion damper
that was supposed
to be ready,

04:20.218 --> 04:21.674
what, three weeks ago?

04:21.803 --> 04:23.418
I'll get to it,
little big man.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.928
You know you can't
ignore me forever, Lupo.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.923
Here's the overnight report.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.846
There was a micro—breach
in the level two sewage line.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.844
lt tripped the biosensor.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.814
Nothing major.
Just annoying.

04:36.485 --> 04:37.895
You are so cute.

04:38.028 --> 04:41.862
lon damper, now,
or I'll send you back
to the mucous lab.

04:41.990 --> 04:42.979
Wow.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.574
Thanks.
No problem.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.279
But you know, Jo,
you're going to...
Fargo.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.655
You're going to
have to explain

04:51.792 --> 04:52.952
the engagement
ring sometime.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.949
Well, I'm really hoping
that he'll be transferred

04:55.086 --> 04:58.749
to the North Pole
or, I don't know,
shot into outer space.

04:58.882 --> 04:59.837
That'd be nice.

04:59.966 --> 05:03.003
Well, for now
the mucous lab is
the best I can do.

05:03.136 --> 05:07.220
You know I'm starting to
believe that you're actually
the real head of G.D.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.214
Damn straight!
(PHONE BEEPING)

05:09.351 --> 05:12.138
Ooh, got to boogie,
blueberry cobbler day
in the cafeteria.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.181
It goes fast.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.517
Who wants
more wedding cake?

05:19.653 --> 05:21.393
I'm fine.
No, no.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.236
Come on, I'll never
get rid of all of it.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.232
And what am I going
to do with 400 pigs
in 400 blankets?

05:26.368 --> 05:27.949
You bring them out
is what you do.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.864
Bless you, Sheriff.

05:30.705 --> 05:31.660
Ew.

05:31.790 --> 05:32.825
What? I'm hungry.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.825
So, Jack, how did
Andy take the news?

05:35.961 --> 05:38.247
Uh, he needed some
robot alone time.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.916
All right, maybe having
all the trappings

05:40.048 --> 05:42.334
of an actual wedding
was a mistake.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.048
Yeah, it was ridiculous.

05:44.177 --> 05:48.341
But, I did
like seeing you
in the tux, Jack.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.507
I like you
calling me Jack.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.435
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

05:55.564 --> 05:57.429
HENRY: So this
honeymoon period

05:57.566 --> 05:59.932
between the two of you
is going to be over soon,
right?

06:00.318 --> 06:01.854
Yeah, I'm almost
out of gas, I think.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.102
(LAUGHING)

06:05.323 --> 06:07.188

Look at the size
of that thing.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.861
(IN A DEEP VOICE)
Cut the chatter, Red Two.

06:08.994 --> 06:10.109

Accelerate to attack speed.

(IMITATING EXPLOSION)

06:16.960 --> 06:18.166
Whoa!

06:18.295 --> 06:19.956
So this is how you
get to be head of CD?

06:20.964 --> 06:22.295
What are you doing here?

06:22.424 --> 06:24.255
Don't you remember
the words "mucous lab"?

06:24.384 --> 06:25.885
I brought your
ion pulse
engine damper.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.126
It's all set.

06:27.762 --> 06:28.922
You finished it?
Yeah.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.137
Handmade by yours truly.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.848
But why would you bother
putting a pulse engine
in this bucket?

06:33.977 --> 06:35.968
It's got to be
60 years old.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.844
The launch system's
still fine.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.812
Yeah, but you and Henry
pulled out navigation,

06:39.941 --> 06:42.148
attitude control,
comm systems.

06:42.777 --> 06:43.766
Huh.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.235
You're going to use this
for an unmanned launch.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.024
Are you testing something?

06:47.324 --> 06:49.565
It's on a
need—to—know basis.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.241
All right.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.078
Let's talk.

06:58.627 --> 07:01.243
I'm thinking in exchange
for your pulse damper,

07:01.379 --> 07:02.960
I need to be
"need—to—know."

07:03.548 --> 07:05.539
Starting with Lupo.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.673
(RUMBLING)

07:09.179 --> 07:10.715
Do you feel that?

07:11.640 --> 07:12.846
Yeah.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.387
Where did you put
the ion pulse damper?

07:16.978 --> 07:18.843
I told you,
I installed it in
the engine compartment.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.686
Nobody told you
to install it!

07:20.815 --> 07:22.066
The ignition
switches are on!

07:22.192 --> 07:23.477
Well, how the hell
was I supposed to know

07:23.610 --> 07:24.816
you'd be in here
playing with yourself?

07:24.945 --> 07:26.481
You completed
the launch circuit.

07:26.947 --> 07:27.936
What?

07:28.490 --> 07:29.479
Whoa!

a launch scheduled?

08:20.250 --> 08:21.740
No.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.457
So, not good, then?

09:00.123 --> 09:02.739
MAN ON PA: A Level Five
alert is in effect.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.992
An unauthorized launch
has been detected.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.208
Where's Fargo?

09:06.337 --> 09:07.292
Don't know.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.411
Well, find him, Larry.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.503
Talk to me, Jo.

09:09.632 --> 09:10.621
The tracking says it was

09:10.759 --> 09:12.295
a decommissioned
Nevada class rocket.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.755
It was primarily used
for manned flight testing,

09:14.888 --> 09:16.469
but it could have a warhead.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.304
No, it's an unmanned probe.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.469
Fargo and l gutted it
to test a new engine.

09:20.602 --> 09:21.557
Nuclear?

09:21.686 --> 09:23.551
No. Faster than light,

09:23.688 --> 09:25.303

Einstein—Grant Bridge.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.645
A bridge device?

09:26.775 --> 09:28.140
There's the gift
that keeps on giving.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.733
There's a protocol
for a renegade launch.

09:30.862 --> 09:33.945
Yes, we neutralize
the rogue with
kinetic countermeasures.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.735
We blast it with
space missiles.
Thank you.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.653
You'll need
Fargo's authorization.

09:37.786 --> 09:38.866
He's not answering.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.151
(SIGHS)

09:40.872 --> 09:43.534
Okay. Larry, get mission
control up and running.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.373
Jo, send an evacuation team
to Section Five.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.959
Henry, we need
a hard trajectory

09:48.088 --> 09:49.373
for the interceptor missiles.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.338
Wow. Almost seems
like you know how
to run the place.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.458
That rocket could come down
in the middle of a city.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.051
I need Fargo's authorization
to launch those interceptors.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.716
I'll find him.
Thanks, Carter.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.009

to Carter now?

11:54.964 --> 11:57.501
Initiating emergency
authorization override.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.340
Dr. Allison Blake,
medical director.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.006
COMPUTER: A command triad
is needed for this function.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.754
Please place your
hands on the glass.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.758
Dr. Allison Blake.
Confirmed.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.767
Dr. Henry Deacon.
Confirmed.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.511
Larry, we're going
to need a third.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.020
This feels like mutiny, l...

12:13.149 --> 12:14.309
We don't have
time to talk.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.312
Okay.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.981
COMPUTER: Larry Haberman.
Triad confirmed.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.569
Command override accepted.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.484
Good afternoon,
Acting Director Blake.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.949
Launch intercept
missiles on my mark.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.821
Three, two, one.

12:29.916 --> 12:30.905
Mark.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.784
COMPUTER: Missiles are away.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.962

to intercept.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.334
WOMAN ON PA:
Paging Dr. Fargo.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.802
Report to Mission Control
immediately.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.755
Wow. Anything?

12:46.891 --> 12:49.849
It looks like
the lab was empty
when the rocket went off.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.969
You find Fargo?
Uh, not yet. No.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.686
What about
the lab security log?

12:53.815 --> 12:55.055
The, uh, the records
were...

12:55.191 --> 12:56.306
Were damaged.

12:56.442 --> 13:01.027
So far just entries
for Henry and Fargo

13:01.155 --> 13:05.023
and "Professor
|.P. Freely."

13:07.954 --> 13:09.740
I'm guessing
that's Zane.

13:09.872 --> 13:10.861
Yeah.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.744
If everyone in town
felt that launch,

13:17.880 --> 13:19.871
it's not like Fargo
would miss this.

13:20.091 --> 13:23.208
Or Zane. He should be here
rubbing our noses in this.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.302
He lives to
watch us screw up.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.381
Well, then
where are they?

13:32.103 --> 13:34.845
Maybe our empty rocket's
not so empty.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.523
(SIGHS)

13:49.287 --> 13:50.276
I think I'm going
to be sick.

13:50.413 --> 13:53.120
Well, we can't exactly
pull over, now can we?

13:53.249 --> 13:54.864
A—ha!
There you are,
Mr. Valve.

13:56.711 --> 13:57.666
(BEEPS)

14:00.256 --> 14:01.621
Oh, life support is up.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.918
Capsule pressure is steady,

14:03.051 --> 14:05.542
oxygen is flowing,
four liters per second.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.054
Who's your daddy?

14:07.180 --> 14:08.340
How much oxygen
do we have?

14:08.473 --> 14:10.555
Uh, at least six hours.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.674
Six hours?
(WHIMPERS)

14:12.810 --> 14:14.516
So basically
we're dead by dinner.
All right.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.773
Mr. Pessimistic,
we're going to
figure this out.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.935
Now is not
the time to panic.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.903
How about now?

14:30.495 --> 14:31.575
They're trying
to kill us.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.740
It's standard protocol
for any unauthorized launch.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.738
"Oh, it's standard protocol
for any unauthorized launch."

14:35.875 --> 14:37.331
Nice last words,
you geek.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.701
Well, how about this?
You're an ass—hat.
Bite me.

14:39.837 --> 14:40.747
Ass—hat!
Bite me!

14:40.880 --> 14:43.212
Ass—hat! Ass—hat! Ass—hat!
Bite me! Bite me!
Bite me! Bite me!

14:44.967 --> 14:47.754
We are on target.
Stop.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.172
COMPUTER:
Thirty seconds to impact.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.215
Stop the missile.
HENRY: What?

14:50.348 --> 14:51.383
Re—secure the lateral drift.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.632
We only have
one shot at this.
How do we abort?

14:53.768 --> 14:55.258
Well, there's
a self—destruct,
but you can't...

14:55.395 --> 14:56.555

15:10.868 --> 15:11.948
What happened?

15:14.580 --> 15:16.366
I really am
going to puke now.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.660
What did you just do?

15:21.796 --> 15:23.582
Fargo's in that rocket.
I think Zane's with him.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.705
They're onboard?
You're... You're sure?

15:25.842 --> 15:26.877
Well, they're both missing.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.546
Wait, you just
aborted the missiles
and you're not sure.

15:29.679 --> 15:30.668
Well, they could
have been killed.

15:30.805 --> 15:32.841
Maybe. But now
six others will die.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.305
The rocket is on
a collision course

15:34.434 --> 15:35.765
with the International
Space Station.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.009
There is a six—member
crew onboard.

15:38.146 --> 15:41.309
And you just blew up
our only chance
to save them.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.610
It's still kind of
awesome though, right?

15:52.827 --> 15:54.067

16:02.295 --> 16:03.751
I've wanted to do
this my whole life.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.836
I mean, just
look out there.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.546
It's beautiful.

Proximity to what?

16:19.937 --> 16:20.926
Whoa.

16:26.569 --> 16:29.311
Oh, that's bigger than
I thought it was.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.232
We're heading
straight for it.

16:50.218 --> 16:52.334

16:52.470 --> 16:53.960
I didn't know about
the space station.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.757
Because you didn't have
all the information.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.255
Get ISS control
on the line.

16:57.391 --> 17:00.679
They need to execute
an emergency thruster burn
to move the station.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.676
The station weighs
800,000 pounds.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.064
They won't even
begin to have
time to move.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.226
Yeah, but Zane and Fargo
will do something, right?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.850
All of the control
systems have been
removed from the capsule.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.602
If they even
survived the launch.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.400
We can talk to them.
I mean, they have a radio.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.616
Comm systems
have been removed.

17:17.245 --> 17:18.735
The ship doesn't have
attitude control.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.829
It doesn't matter
if we can communicate
with Zane and Fargo.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.164
They can't help us.

17:23.292 --> 17:24.953
Please, Carter,
let me do my job.

17:26.462 --> 17:27.622
Yeah.

straight for it.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.758

all our oxygen.

18:27.648 --> 18:28.683
We need oxygen.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.352
Yeah, not if we're dead.

18:30.484 --> 18:33.191
We vent oxygen
out the right side,
it might alter the course.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.773
You got to be
kidding me.

siting position

19:58.948 --> 20:00.654
based on new course
and speed.

20:00.783 --> 20:03.399
Well, they're alive.
I mean, the thing
can't turn on its own.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.401
You were right, Carter.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.655
Now the question is,

20:10.251 --> 20:12.082
how do we
get them back?

20:12.795 --> 20:13.705
CARTER: And that is What?

20:13.838 --> 20:15.954
The communication panel
from the rocket lab.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.455
It looks like a stereo
I had in high school.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.924
Yeah, well, your stereo
probably had more
computing power.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.461
The capsule's
based on technology

20:23.597 --> 20:25.007
usedin
the Mercury program.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.427
It's an antique
so we should probably

20:27.560 --> 20:30.302
confirm if any
of the systems
on board are active.

20:30.771 --> 20:31.760
Hey. We got a green.

20:32.273 --> 20:36.141

so that's six hours
of oxygen,

20:36.277 --> 20:37.687
maybe less.

ALLISON: That's not
a lot of time.

20:39.113 --> 20:43.026
Well, I mean, they
managed to turn
the ship, though.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.653
Right? I mean, come on,
what can they use?

20:45.786 --> 20:47.902
Uh, fireworks,
a canoe paddle?

20:48.038 --> 20:49.824
What's in the ship?

20:49.957 --> 20:51.663
It's never been tested.

20:51.792 --> 20:52.827
The FTL drive?

20:52.960 --> 20:55.622
Yeah. If we can
get the BCE
up and running.

20:55.755 --> 20:56.744
That sounds good.
How about we speak
in whole words?

20:58.174 --> 21:01.291

can activate the
Faster than Light drive

21:01.427 --> 21:02.587
and we're prepared
for their re—entry

Oh, the energy thing
that stops the space...

21:08.768 --> 21:10.258
Then we can
probably bring
them back home.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.009
But we can't be sure
that Zane and Fargo

21:12.146 --> 21:14.762
will even think about
using the FTL.

busy playing

you just gave me
the pulse damper

21:36.712 --> 21:39.294
instead of trying
to extort information...

21:39.423 --> 21:40.663

totally think of.

the pulse damper from

will happen ifthey turn
it on without the damper?

uses the stupid thing.

supposed to know that
we'd need it up here?

have much time

23:35.164 --> 23:37.997
to explain about
Zane and Fargo
in that ship.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.500
I know. And you
saved their lives.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.334
But you're mad.
No.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.833
You're something.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.757
Um, I had a hunch.

37:09.769 --> 37:15.014
Okay. Well,
on your order, Captain.

37:18.486 --> 37:19.475
Engage.

37:21.114 --> 37:22.274
(BOTH SCREAMING)

37:29.497 --> 37:30.782
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

37:34.919 --> 37:36.455
(LAUGHS TRIUMPHANTLY)
Nice catch!

37:36.588 --> 37:37.623
(ALL CHEERING)

37:37.756 --> 37:38.745
9%??? =,

37:44.471 --> 37:46.553
Don't worry, kid,
we'll fix you.

37:48.308 --> 37:49.514
All right?

37:52.479 --> 37:53.685
That was awesome!

37:53.813 --> 37:55.098
(GASPING)

37:55.231 --> 37:56.391
(KNOCKING)

37:57.942 --> 38:01.526
Uh, yeah, not the word
that I would choose, but, um,

38:01.654 --> 38:03.565
thanks for getting us down.

38:03.698 --> 38:04.938
I couldn't have
done it without you.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.469
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.934
Fine. But do not
touch my ass.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.942
Uh, it's good
to see you, JoJo.

39:01.506 --> 39:02.461
Mmm.

39:04.384 --> 39:05.624
Hey.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.375
So has the torch
been passed?

39:07.512 --> 39:12.131
Yes. All G.D. director
power is back where
it belongs. With Fargo.

39:12.267 --> 39:13.598
Had to be fun, though.

39:13.726 --> 39:15.978
I mean, being back
in the big chair again.

39:16.104 --> 39:19.892
Uh—uh. Running that place
is a pain in my neck.

39:21.484 --> 39:24.442
You need a hot bath?
Cowgirl?

39:24.654 --> 39:26.485
Mmm. That sounds good.

39:28.408 --> 39:30.694
Why don't you
take me home, Jack?

39:32.287 --> 39:33.527
So we're back
to Jack now?

39:34.497 --> 39:37.364
I'm just keeping track.
Is that...
That's where we're at?

39:37.500 --> 39:39.365
Okay, listen, if
we're going to be
working together

39:39.502 --> 39:43.620
and sleeping together,
things are going to
get complicated, Jack.

39:46.926 --> 39:48.837
I can handle complicated.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.806
(RINGS DOORBELL)

39:56.978 --> 39:57.888
SARAH: Andy?

39:58.021 --> 39:59.477
SARAH, hi.

40:01.482 --> 40:02.437
Can I come in?

40:02.567 --> 40:03.602
Of course.

40:08.948 --> 40:11.189
I heard how you
helped save the day.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.157
I'm glad your
re—boot was successful.

40:13.286 --> 40:14.446
Thanks.

40:14.579 --> 40:18.447
The download gave me time
to think about things.

40:18.583 --> 40:21.871
I guess you've come
to pick up your
spare uniform.

40:22.462 --> 40:25.670
SARAH, did I do
something wrong?

40:26.215 --> 40:28.922
No, Andy,
I'm sorry I panicked.

40:29.052 --> 40:31.338
I guess I'm just
not ready to be
a housewife.

40:31.888 --> 40:33.469
Well, you can
work if you want to.

40:33.598 --> 40:36.010
Whatever makes you happy.

40:36.142 --> 40:40.055
I don't know if that's
enough for me to devote
my artificial life to.

40:41.522 --> 40:42.773
Are you okay?

40:45.401 --> 40:47.892
It's the age—old story.

40:48.029 --> 40:49.610
Boy meets house,

40:52.408 --> 40:53.523
boy loses house.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.453
But I understand.

40:59.374 --> 41:01.911
I'm not saying
I don't want to
spend time with you.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.286
If you want, we can
leave the door open.

41:06.422 --> 41:07.707
Literally.

41:09.258 --> 41:10.464
Really?

41:12.595 --> 41:15.007
I would like that
very much.

41:18.184 --> 41:23.099
So, Fargo, you and Zane
had some quality
boy time up there.

41:23.231 --> 41:25.347
Yeah, well, there was
nowhere else to go.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.566
Did you talk about
anything in particular?

41:28.695 --> 41:31.402
Well, you know,
just space stuff.

41:33.366 --> 41:36.233
Dr. Fargo,
I need you to
come with us.

41:36.369 --> 41:38.781
Wait a minute,
where is he going?

41:38.913 --> 41:41.245
l have orders
to escort him
to Washington.

41:41.374 --> 41:43.456
Dr. Fargo,
please follow me.

41:44.127 --> 41:45.833
Sure.

42:04.772 --> 42:07.149
So, how about
them Redskins?

42:14.198 --> 42:16.314
It is not
football season, is it?

42:16.451 --> 42:17.486
(DOOR OPENS)

42:28.629 --> 42:30.620
Dr. Fargo, I'm...

42:30.757 --> 42:32.463
Senator Michaela Wen.

42:33.593 --> 42:34.673
I know who you are.

42:35.470 --> 42:37.335
Oh, well, then you also
know that I head up

42:37.472 --> 42:39.554
the technology
appropriations committee.

42:39.682 --> 42:43.345
The same one that directs
funding for your, um,

42:43.478 --> 42:45.014
scientific playground.

42:48.983 --> 42:51.349
You did just
launch a rocket

42:51.486 --> 42:54.694
that nearly took out
the International
Space Station.

42:54.822 --> 42:56.232
That was an accident.

42:56.365 --> 42:57.946
I wanted to leave
a note on the windshield.

43:02.121 --> 43:03.497
Do you know
why we're here?

43:04.290 --> 43:07.453
To assess
the continued value of
our work in Eureka?

43:07.877 --> 43:10.084
You are a bright man,
Dr. Fargo.

43:11.464 --> 43:12.579
Get comfortable.

43:13.341 --> 43:16.833
Your future in Eureka
is about to get
very complicated.
