00:14.280 --> 00:16.578
- Hello, gorgeous!
- Thank you.

00:16.616 --> 00:19.084
Not you! Me. This.

00:19.119 --> 00:23.647
My new title and my new office.

00:23.690 --> 00:29.458
It's perfect.
Except for one unsightly little...

00:29.496 --> 00:30.827
Marc. Marc!

00:33.700 --> 00:36.601
Sorry. I will get used to
my new glass door.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.830
Welcome home, boys!

00:38.872 --> 00:41.306
Marc, I'm really proud of your promotion

00:41.341 --> 00:43.969
and I'm really excited
that we get to share an office,

00:44.010 --> 00:46.308
but since it is a professional space,

00:46.346 --> 00:48.439
we could try and
keep the space professional.

00:48.948 --> 00:51.041
Sure, I'll get rid of the Titans of Sport

00:51.084 --> 00:54.542
as soon as you take down
your ethnic bric-a-brac.

00:55.422 --> 00:56.582
And while we're at it,

00:56.623 --> 01:01.083
please refrain from carrying on
in your overly exuberant Latina ways.

01:01.127 --> 01:04.688
Marc, I do not carry on
in an overly exuberant...

01:05.899 --> 01:09.391
Oh, my God!
I won a Blobby!

01:11.571 --> 01:12.697
What happened? Are you okay?

01:12.739 --> 01:15.970
No. I'm sharing an office
with a chunky, cheering Charo!

01:16.009 --> 01:17.169
I won a Blobby!

01:17.210 --> 01:19.178
That's great! A Blobby!

01:20.713 --> 01:22.078
What is a Blobby?

01:22.115 --> 01:23.173
I don't know!

01:23.216 --> 01:26.515
It's a Black and Latina Organization
of Bloggers,

01:26.553 --> 01:29.113
and they would like to
award Betty Suarez

01:29.155 --> 01:30.884
for the best new blog!

01:30.924 --> 01:33.188
I didn't even know
anyone knew about my blog!

01:33.226 --> 01:35.592
Congratulations. That is amazing.

01:35.628 --> 01:38.119
Did anybody hear
that I'm a junior fashion editor?

01:38.164 --> 01:41.691
This is crazy. They want to send
someone over to interview me today,

01:41.734 --> 01:43.031
and I have to find my own person

01:43.069 --> 01:45.264
to present me with the award
at the ceremony.

01:45.805 --> 01:46.829
Will you do it?

01:46.873 --> 01:47.999
You want me to?

01:48.041 --> 01:49.633
Who else would I want more?

01:49.676 --> 01:51.769
No, I'd love to. I mean, this is huge.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.242
Well, I don't know if it's huge.

01:53.279 --> 01:58.080
It's being held at "the place near
Wendy's that has the cupcakes. "

01:58.118 --> 01:59.847
I'm guessing it's a little low-rent.

01:59.886 --> 02:03.947
Who cares? An award is an award
and you deserve it. Your blog is terrific.

02:03.990 --> 02:05.651
Really? You read it?

02:07.827 --> 02:11.388
Not yet. I have it bookmarked and
I'm really psyched to get around to it.

02:11.431 --> 02:13.729
Well, please do it quick,
because the sooner you do,

02:13.766 --> 02:18.794
it'll put me that much closer
to hitting my 75 readers mark.

02:18.838 --> 02:20.135
Well, it is only the beginning.

02:20.173 --> 02:21.697
I know you don't have
a very large readership,

02:21.741 --> 02:24.073
but pretty soon people will be
stopping you on the street.

02:26.613 --> 02:28.877
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I love you.

02:28.915 --> 02:33.409
It's you! I love your show.
I love when you're all, "Marc!"

02:34.587 --> 02:36.350
What the hell are you talking about?

02:36.389 --> 02:39.324
Wow, you're always on, huh? Genius!

02:44.731 --> 02:47.359
It's not fair. You, Betty.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.733
Everyone who was ever
Daniel's assistant got promoted but me.

02:50.770 --> 02:53.534
I want to get promoted.
I'm sick of being a receptionist,

02:53.573 --> 02:55.700
always being
at everyone's Beck and Victoria.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.068
Well, Daniel needs someone.

02:58.111 --> 03:01.444
Why don't you ask him for that job
again? Maybe you'll be next.

03:01.481 --> 03:04.609
Mandy, it's so good.

03:04.651 --> 03:09.350
It's like I'm finally my own man
around here. It's really liberating.

03:09.589 --> 03:10.613
Marc!

03:10.657 --> 03:11.715
Got to go.

03:14.093 --> 03:16.891
What could that simpering fool
have been talking about?

03:16.930 --> 03:19.421
I have no idea... Oh!

03:19.699 --> 03:20.859
What is it?

03:22.602 --> 03:26.971
"Mean queens of fashion
in New York City's finest drag bar.

03:27.006 --> 03:33.434
"Double bill featuring Manna Wintour
and Wilheldiva Hater"?

03:34.180 --> 03:36.740
That is so... Offensive.

03:37.417 --> 03:41.786
I will not be mocked by some
low-rent drag queen. It's insulting.

03:41.821 --> 03:42.947
It's inexcusable.

03:42.989 --> 03:46.618
It's delicious. What's that web address?

03:46.659 --> 03:47.751
Yeah, I'll write it down...

03:47.794 --> 03:49.352
Don't even bother.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.956
I'll have my lawyers draw up
a cease and desist order immediately.

03:52.999 --> 03:56.298
<i>As if I didn't have enough queens
to shut down right here at Mode.</i>

03:59.872 --> 04:01.999
- Congratulations, Betty.
- Thank you.

04:02.041 --> 04:05.568
You must be so excited to be honored
by the Big Lesbian Order of Bloggers.

04:05.612 --> 04:08.274
Amanda, I already told you.
That's not what BLOB stands for.

04:08.314 --> 04:11.112
It stands for
Big Lumpy Obese Bloggers.

04:11.150 --> 04:14.813
Those slams might hurt if
they were coming from award winners.

04:14.854 --> 04:16.845
Everyone, let's get started.

04:16.889 --> 04:19.050
You're running this? Fun.

04:19.091 --> 04:22.493
It'll be like watching a five-year-old
pretend to drive the car.

04:22.528 --> 04:24.860
Thank you, Willie,
for that resounding vote of bitchiness,

04:24.897 --> 04:27.229
but I am nonetheless
very excited to announce

04:27.267 --> 04:30.828
that I've landed us an exclusive
fashion shoot and interview

04:30.870 --> 04:34.033
with Diego Martinez and Victoria Velez.

04:36.676 --> 04:38.541
I have to deal with that all day.

04:38.578 --> 04:40.205
I love them!

04:40.246 --> 04:42.237
I've seen
every single one of his movies.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.274
<i>From Dawn of Shame, where
Victoria plays a disgraced prostitute,</i>

04:45.318 --> 04:48.048
<i>to Tides of Regret, where she plays
a disgraced traffic cop.</i>

04:48.087 --> 04:49.554
Must she get so worked up?

04:49.589 --> 04:51.250
And overseeing the fashion shoot

04:51.291 --> 04:54.385
is our newest junior fashion editor,
Marc St. James.

04:58.164 --> 05:00.997
And covering
the interview component...

05:01.034 --> 05:02.228
Please be me. Please be me.

05:02.268 --> 05:04.964
<i>Is this a creative meeting
or The Price Is Right?</i>

05:05.004 --> 05:07.063
Actually, I was planning on
doing it myself.

05:07.106 --> 05:10.439
Well, by "it," do you mean
the interview or Victoria Velez?

05:10.476 --> 05:14.936
No, Willie. I assure you my interest
in the interview is purely professional.

05:14.981 --> 05:18.382
And how many Diego Martinez movies
have you actually seen?

05:21.821 --> 05:25.154
You know what? It would be fun
for us to do it together, Betty.

05:25.191 --> 05:28.524
Yes! I'm so excited.
I have so many questions.

05:28.561 --> 05:30.688
I'm gonna start
by re-watching all of their movies.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.221
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, Betty.
There's plenty of time.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.699
I don't know, Daniel.

05:34.734 --> 05:37.259
Should she slow down
or you speed up?

05:37.303 --> 05:41.239
I mean, I would hate to see
the assistant exceed the master.

05:42.775 --> 05:44.402
Who am I kidding? I'd love to see that.

05:54.120 --> 05:58.557
Hey! Guess what? I found
the perfect new assistant for you. Me.

05:58.591 --> 06:01.059
Wouldn't that be weird,
now that we're fun buddies again?

06:01.094 --> 06:03.119
Ooh, fun buddy.

06:03.162 --> 06:04.857
There are cameras everywhere.

06:05.798 --> 06:09.359
Hey. Look, Daniel, I know you.
If you hire some new hottie,

06:09.402 --> 06:11.734
you're gonna spend half your day
wondering, "Will we sleep together?

06:11.771 --> 06:14.467
"When will we sleep together? Will she
get all crazy or will it be casual?"

06:14.507 --> 06:16.338
With me, you already know
we're sleeping together,

06:16.376 --> 06:19.675
I am all crazy, and it's casual!
Total timesaver.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.307
I guess I can't argue with that.

06:23.349 --> 06:26.045
Um... But I will need you
to find a new receptionist.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.613
Thank you, Daniel!
Thank you, thank you!

06:31.557 --> 06:33.286
Lots of shrieking today.

06:38.998 --> 06:41.694
Wow. You're excited.

06:41.734 --> 06:44.100
It's just 'cause, like,
I'm the biggest Bettyhead out there.

06:44.137 --> 06:47.402
- "Bettyhead"?
- It's what we call the core 22 of us.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.874
We should get started, 'cause
if I'm not back to work in 20 minutes,

06:49.909 --> 06:51.103
I'm so fired.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.874
Yeah, okay. Fine.
Do I have anything in my teeth?

06:53.913 --> 06:54.971
No. Okay.

06:55.648 --> 06:57.081
So,

06:57.116 --> 07:00.108
the tone of your blog is
normally really positive,

07:00.153 --> 07:04.021
but what I think your readers
really want to know is,

07:04.056 --> 07:05.387
who are you dying to bitch out?

07:06.793 --> 07:09.728
What? No. No. No one.

07:10.930 --> 07:17.233
I know a lot of people use their blogs as
a place to vent petty frustrations, but...

07:17.937 --> 07:19.404
Not that there's anything
wrong with that.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.270
- I mean, that's cool, too.
- Hey. How's it going in here?

07:21.307 --> 07:22.968
Hey, Daniel. This is Wendy.

07:23.009 --> 07:25.876
<i>Wendy, this is Daniel Meade,
editor-in-chief of Mode magazine.</i>

07:25.912 --> 07:28.107
He's also going to present me
with my award.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.275
Oh.

07:30.316 --> 07:31.374
That's cool.

07:31.417 --> 07:33.248
But just so you know,

07:33.286 --> 07:38.519
the Blobbies are about celebrating
minority writers in new media,

07:38.558 --> 07:41.026
not celebrity presenters.

07:41.661 --> 07:45.256
Okay. That sounds like a fun night.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.664
I should probably get going.

07:48.668 --> 07:53.230
No, wait. Daniel, why don't you stay?
Hang out. I could use your help.

07:53.272 --> 07:56.730
Wendy wants something dishy,
and I think I'm disappointing her.

07:57.143 --> 08:00.635
Oh, my God, never. A little.

08:00.947 --> 08:04.849
Well, good luck getting any dish
out of our resident Pollyanna, here.

08:06.919 --> 08:08.682
Has she always been this way?

08:08.721 --> 08:10.621
God, no. She was way worse.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.887
You know, the first day,
she showed up in this insane poncho.

08:13.926 --> 08:17.453
And her hair... Do you remember that?
It was crazy, right?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.089
Yeah. Crazy.

08:19.866 --> 08:21.231
And...

08:21.267 --> 08:23.030
So there's this glass window.

08:23.069 --> 08:24.832
I mean, no one thought
she would last the day.

08:24.871 --> 08:27.635
Seriously, if you had told me
three years later she'd be an editor,

08:27.707 --> 08:29.106
I would have laughed you
out of the room.

08:30.276 --> 08:33.177
Our Betty,
she's really come a long way.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.736
- Thanks, Daniel.
- But to me,

08:34.813 --> 08:37.908
she'll always be
my sweet little assistant.

08:37.950 --> 08:43.717
Always on hand to get me my bagel.
Could you hand me the water?

08:48.694 --> 08:50.252
Okay, that's all we have time for.

08:50.296 --> 08:52.059
So, how was that?

08:52.098 --> 08:53.360
Perfect.

09:23.763 --> 09:24.787
Marc?

09:25.932 --> 09:27.365
What are you doing here?

09:27.400 --> 09:33.339
I couldn't allow this affront
to your dignity go on uninvestigated.

09:33.372 --> 09:35.340
Marc! I found us a table!

09:37.376 --> 09:38.843
You and Claire?

09:38.878 --> 09:40.140
We found a common interest.

09:41.213 --> 09:44.182
<i>All right, y'all! It is show time!</i>

09:45.318 --> 09:51.848
<i>Ladies and lady-like gentlemen,
boys and boy-girls,</i>

09:51.891 --> 09:56.089
<i>without further ado, and because
we lose the place at 10:00,</i>

09:58.965 --> 10:02.196
<i>I present to you the Queen of Mean,</i>

10:02.234 --> 10:06.728
<i>who always serves her cruelty
à la mode.</i>

10:08.274 --> 10:11.368
<i>Wilheldiva Hater!</i>

10:17.750 --> 10:20.082
<i>Good evening.
Is it Fashion Week already?</i>

10:20.119 --> 10:21.984
<i>Because I've never seen
such weak fashion.</i>

10:24.557 --> 10:26.081
<i>Now, who here's from Jersey?</i>

10:27.493 --> 10:28.892
<i>Good, you're learning.</i>

10:30.129 --> 10:31.790
<i>Who here's wearing jersey?</i>

10:32.665 --> 10:34.030
Oh.

10:34.533 --> 10:37.559
<i>I've never seen such gorgeous leather.</i>

10:37.603 --> 10:39.036
<i>But enough about your face.</i>

10:41.774 --> 10:43.833
Finally, some decent material.

10:43.876 --> 10:46.936
It's hardly a skilled impression, though.
She sounds nothing like me.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.003
Marc!

10:57.356 --> 11:00.291
Congratulations! Blobby winner!

11:00.326 --> 11:03.318
- Hilda, you scared me! Champagne?
- Yeah.

11:03.362 --> 11:05.227
Oh! Thank you.

11:05.798 --> 11:10.929
I'm sorry, Hilda. I wish I was a little bit
more in the mood to celebrate,

11:10.970 --> 11:13.837
but this really weird thing happened
with Daniel today at work.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.636
He became a woman, like his brother?

11:16.208 --> 11:18.108
No, not that weird.

11:18.144 --> 11:21.079
This woman came from the Blobbies
to interview me,

11:21.113 --> 11:24.207
and he sat in, you know, to tell
funny stories about me or whatever.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.742
And all he could talk about was
how I never fit in when I first got there,

11:27.787 --> 11:32.247
how badly I dressed,
how I was his good little assistant.

11:32.291 --> 11:34.953
Well, all of those things
are kind of true.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.092
Yeah, but my readers don't know that.

11:39.131 --> 11:42.794
I mean, maybe it's just 22 girls
reading aloud to their cats,

11:42.835 --> 11:47.499
but they think of me as this
put-together, polished professional,

11:47.540 --> 11:48.734
and now that's ruined.

11:49.008 --> 11:51.374
You think Daniel was trying to
make you look bad?

11:51.410 --> 11:52.775
Because I don't think he would do that.

11:52.812 --> 11:56.339
I guess he is giving me the opportunity
to interview two of my idols tomorrow.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.180
Yeah, you know, he probably didn't
even know what he was saying.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.083
Maybe you're just being
a little sensitive.

12:01.620 --> 12:02.814
Mmm.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.880
You're probably right. All right, cheers.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.050
To the Blobbies!

12:06.092 --> 12:07.320
Blobbies!

12:10.429 --> 12:11.828
That's cheap.

12:32.184 --> 12:34.118
So, what did you think?

12:34.186 --> 12:37.019
Wilhelmina!
Oh, my God, you came!

12:37.056 --> 12:38.819
I can't believe it! I love you!

12:38.858 --> 12:40.553
What did you think of the show?

12:40.593 --> 12:41.787
I adored it.

12:41.827 --> 12:44.819
Do it one more time,
and I will sue your fake ass off.

12:45.798 --> 12:46.822
Marc!

12:53.873 --> 12:56.307
Hey, Amanda,
will you hold all my calls?

12:56.342 --> 12:59.004
Diego and Victoria
are gonna be here in 42 minutes,

12:59.044 --> 13:01.308
and I need every last second
to prepare for the interview.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.405
Okay, calm down, Betty.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.313
Good things come
to those who weigh less.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.443
Besides, I'm officially
Daniel's assistant now.

13:06.485 --> 13:08.476
So if you need anyone
to not take your messages,

13:08.521 --> 13:09.954
you'll have to talk to my replacement.

13:11.924 --> 13:14.552
- Helen!
- Helen?

13:14.593 --> 13:17.061
- Okay, who wants to party?
- Me, me! I want to party!

13:18.531 --> 13:21.056
Hey, you look good, too!
Did you get dermabrasion?

13:21.100 --> 13:23.091
No, I'm just wearing pants today.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.193
Wasn't she fired?

13:25.404 --> 13:27.702
What is that?
What is the little lady doing?

13:28.007 --> 13:29.702
Oh, um... No, that's just Betty.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.505
She's always forgetting
the English word for things.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.603
Right, the cleaning lady.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.670
<i>Sí.</i>

13:35.114 --> 13:36.513
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

13:36.549 --> 13:38.449
Did you guys widen those elevators

13:38.484 --> 13:41.476
or did that stupid doctor
pull my eyes too tight?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.145
Don't laugh. It'll happen to you.

13:44.757 --> 13:51.287
And so, Diego, Victoria, since your
relationship as director and actress

13:51.330 --> 13:53.890
is all about working
in harmony together,

13:53.933 --> 13:56.697
I thought, what better theme

13:56.735 --> 13:59.761
for our photo shoot than symbiosis!

14:04.543 --> 14:08.809
I see you as the anemone
and you as the clownfish,

14:08.848 --> 14:10.679
harmoniously intertwined,

14:10.716 --> 14:14.550
offering each other
the sustenance and protection needed

14:14.587 --> 14:20.492
to survive
in this harsh creative climate.

14:22.228 --> 14:26.597
Plus, your body is gonna look
smoking hot in this dress.

14:27.666 --> 14:29.691
The idea is odd.
The clothes are strange.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.498
- I love it.
- Great.

14:34.773 --> 14:37.207
I am so excited. I spent all night

14:37.243 --> 14:39.905
reviewing every interview
they've given in the last five years,

14:39.945 --> 14:41.469
because I want to make sure that
we don't come away

14:41.513 --> 14:42.912
with the same old stuff, you know?

14:42.948 --> 14:45.883
I spent most of my prep time
doing pull-ups.

14:45.918 --> 14:49.354
<i>Well, Victoria's intimidating.
Her body in Nights of Torment? Insane.</i>

14:49.388 --> 14:50.719
What about her monologue?

14:50.756 --> 14:52.383
When she breaks down and she admits

14:52.424 --> 14:54.892
that she's the one who killed
the other nun.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.588
Broke my heart.

14:56.695 --> 14:59.493
Yeah, I watched her nude scenes
on YouTube.

14:59.531 --> 15:03.558
And here come our own anemone
and clownfish! Daniel and Betty.

15:03.602 --> 15:08.039
Hi! I'm Betty. It's so nice to meet you.
I'm your biggest fan.

15:08.874 --> 15:11.809
Hi. Daniel Meade. I've really been
looking forward to this interview.

15:11.844 --> 15:15.644
Then why is she the only one
who looks prepared?

15:17.016 --> 15:18.779
Betty, thank you so much for
holding that for me.

15:20.886 --> 15:21.944
Okay!

15:23.989 --> 15:26.924
Why don't we get started?
You two can go change.

15:27.326 --> 15:29.851
And you two, change.

15:32.631 --> 15:35.031
Can I really get away with this?

15:35.067 --> 15:36.091
Of course you can.

15:36.135 --> 15:38.933
I mean, you're the woman
who made a nun's habit look sexy.

15:40.706 --> 15:42.435
<i>You saw Nights of Torment?</i>

15:42.474 --> 15:45.409
I loved every single minute.

16:06.999 --> 16:09.524
Perfect! That's great.
I think we have all we need.

16:09.568 --> 16:10.796
Thank you so much!

16:12.204 --> 16:13.569
That was amazing.

16:13.605 --> 16:16.802
You ready to knock out the interview?
I have a million questions.

16:16.842 --> 16:18.332
Betty, I am editor-in-chief.

16:18.377 --> 16:19.776
Why don't you let me
take the lead on this?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.177
So, I have a million questions for you.

16:21.213 --> 16:22.578
Well, if you have a million questions,

16:22.614 --> 16:24.582
then you probably
don't need this, right?

16:24.616 --> 16:26.846
Well, I have a question, too.

16:27.353 --> 16:30.652
Is that really your folder
or were you just trying to impress me?

16:30.689 --> 16:34.022
Well, he was definitely trying to do that.
This is my research.

16:34.059 --> 16:37.051
All he did to prepare for the meeting
were pull-ups?

16:39.031 --> 16:40.191
Is that true?

16:40.232 --> 16:41.256
- Not...
- Yes.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.928
<i>But, I mean, he's so much better
than when I first got to Mode.</i>

16:43.969 --> 16:45.994
You don't even want to know
how he used to prepare for meetings.

16:46.038 --> 16:47.835
- Betty.
- Really?

16:48.407 --> 16:52.639
<i>Well, it was only because you looked
so incredible in Nights of Torment.</i>

16:52.678 --> 16:54.509
It's four and a half hours.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.309
You really make it
through the whole thing?

16:56.348 --> 16:57.406
Well, not...

16:57.449 --> 16:59.781
Well, he made it
through the nude scenes.

16:59.818 --> 17:03.720
He's a big fan of
the nude scenes. Huh?

17:07.859 --> 17:09.054
Thank you so much.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.359
- What was that?
- What?

17:12.765 --> 17:15.029
What? You embarrassed me
in front of Victoria!

17:15.067 --> 17:18.036
Come on, Daniel. I was just teasing.

17:18.069 --> 17:19.627
I mean, it's not like
I said anything worse

17:19.671 --> 17:21.969
than any of the things
you said about me yesterday.

17:22.007 --> 17:24.805
You said them
to a major international film star

17:24.843 --> 17:27.107
who might go blabbing them
all over Cannes next year.

17:27.146 --> 17:30.912
I said mine on a tiny website
to a band of 20 cat-loving weirdos.

17:30.949 --> 17:32.712
It's a little different, don't you think?

17:39.958 --> 17:44.486
I'm mad because you totally
hit on that guy I was trying to stalk.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.828
Why does your face look familiar?

17:46.865 --> 17:50.130
Well, it shouldn't. I had it totally redone
since the last time I was here.

17:50.969 --> 17:53.870
Here's the name of that place
where I got my jacket.

17:54.306 --> 17:56.240
Why would I care
where you got your jacket?

17:56.608 --> 17:57.939
Because you asked.

18:14.626 --> 18:16.856
Please, Ms. Slater,
don't shut down my show.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.126
It's my only livelihood
and I can't afford a lawsuit.

18:20.165 --> 18:24.499
Or a decent dress, it seems.
Now get out. Rayon hurts my eyes.

18:26.538 --> 18:27.664
Hey, Willie.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.731
Callie from Long Lash
is coming tomorrow.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.437
She wants to do a breast cancer
fund-raising tie-in with us.

18:32.478 --> 18:35.504
Look, I know. The only thing you hate
more than corporate altruism

18:35.547 --> 18:38.277
is drugstore makeup,
but she really wants to meet you.

18:39.017 --> 18:40.279
Fine.

18:40.319 --> 18:41.377
Thank you.

18:44.223 --> 18:47.283
By the way, you look nice.
I like you in white.

18:48.026 --> 18:49.152
Thank you.

18:52.464 --> 18:55.433
Wait. Come back tomorrow.

18:55.467 --> 18:59.699
Since you're no longer performing,
I may have a new job for you.

19:07.045 --> 19:09.707
Mandy, what were you thinking,
bringing her back here?

19:09.748 --> 19:11.978
That giant girl is a giant mess.

19:12.017 --> 19:13.382
Marc, I couldn't help it.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.045
She's like my
Ghost of Lonely Christmas Future.

19:16.088 --> 19:19.182
Besides, she's changed.
She has totally gotten it together.

19:19.224 --> 19:21.089
<i>Hold magazine, please mode.</i>

19:21.126 --> 19:22.650
- You're absolutely right.
- Yeah.

19:23.595 --> 19:25.495
- Hi, sweetie!
- Hey!

19:25.531 --> 19:27.795
Thanks for hooking me up with this job!

19:27.833 --> 19:29.664
You know, I've had
some hard times in my life,

19:29.701 --> 19:35.571
but last week when I hit the big 3-0,
everything started to come together.

19:35.607 --> 19:37.370
And then you
hooking me up with this job?

19:37.409 --> 19:40.037
It's like the cherry
on top of the pill bottle.

19:40.078 --> 19:41.375
I'm so glad.

19:41.413 --> 19:42.937
I need a Town Car.

19:42.981 --> 19:44.107
Don't we all, honey.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.982
- Your friend seems happy here.
- Doesn't she?

19:49.021 --> 19:50.249
Fire her immediately.

20:00.365 --> 20:03.163
And that is enough of that.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.033
But I still feel bad.

20:05.270 --> 20:07.864
Weird. I got this mass e-mail
from Claire Meade

20:07.906 --> 20:09.840
inviting me to a drag show.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.467
<i>Better steer clear, papi.</i>

20:11.510 --> 20:13.910
We know what happens
when you get around drag queens.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.107
Hey, I was not fooled.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.378
It was Betty's party,
I was just trying to be polite.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.180
- Okay.
- It's not funny!

20:21.954 --> 20:24.514
God, Daniel was so mean to me today.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.353
Do you know
what he called my Bettyheads?

20:26.391 --> 20:29.189
He said they were
a tiny band of cat-loving weirdos.

20:29.995 --> 20:32.088
That's kind of
what you called them yourself.

20:32.130 --> 20:35.463
Made me so mad. But you know what?

20:35.500 --> 20:36.524
I'm gonna go into work tomorrow

20:36.568 --> 20:38.365
and I'm gonna tell him
exactly how he made me feel.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.530
<i>Mi hija, I would not be mad at Daniel.</i>

20:40.572 --> 20:43.439
As close as you are,
you still work for him.

20:43.475 --> 20:46.239
If you want to say something,
say it to your family. Not your boss.

21:10.636 --> 21:14.037
<i>"Dear Betty, I love your blog.</i>

21:14.072 --> 21:16.233
<i>"You're always so positive
and inspiring.</i>

21:16.275 --> 21:19.039
<i>"Doesn't anything ever get you mad?
Fiona 21. "</i>

21:27.019 --> 21:31.149
<i>You know what, Fiona?
Yes, sometimes something does.</i>

21:31.189 --> 21:33.589
<i>I know I don't usually
use this space to vent,</i>

21:33.625 --> 21:36.617
<i>but since there are only a handful
of you out there, what the hell?</i>

21:39.564 --> 21:40.588
<i>Heck.</i>

21:45.137 --> 21:46.229
Hell.

21:46.271 --> 21:47.863
<i>Today a really good friend
was insensitive.</i>

21:47.906 --> 21:49.168
<i>Well, I thought he was a friend.
He humiliated me.</i>

21:49.207 --> 21:50.606
<i>He was being a total jerk.</i>

21:50.642 --> 21:52.337
<i>Downright cruel to me.</i>

21:53.378 --> 21:57.371
<i>And after I've spent the past
three years making him look good,</i>

21:57.416 --> 22:01.750
<i>trashes me, my blog, and all of you.
That jerk has everything.</i>

22:01.787 --> 22:04.381
<i>Why would he put down
the one thing that's mine?</i>

22:30.749 --> 22:33.684
Why is she still here?
Didn't Willie tell you to fire her?

22:33.719 --> 22:36.847
She did. And I tried, but I couldn't
bring myself to do it, Marc.

22:36.888 --> 22:38.685
This job means so much to her.

22:38.824 --> 22:40.553
- Oh. Really?
- Yeah.

22:40.592 --> 22:42.150
What does your job mean to you?

22:42.194 --> 22:45.186
If Willie comes in here and sees
her hastily stitched together head

22:45.230 --> 22:46.595
sitting behind that desk,

22:46.631 --> 22:49.122
Helen's not the only one
who's gonna be out of a job.

22:49.167 --> 22:51.226
Who? Who else?
Bring it. What did you hear?

22:52.337 --> 22:54.567
Just fire her. You have no choice.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.543
Hey, Amanda, could you help me
with something on the computer?

22:58.844 --> 23:00.038
Um...

23:02.280 --> 23:03.440
Sure.

23:04.783 --> 23:06.182
I'll do it later!

23:07.352 --> 23:09.047
Hi, foxy.

23:09.087 --> 23:10.213
Betty Suarez.

23:10.288 --> 23:12.381
<i>Mi hija,
have you checked your blog today?</i>

23:12.624 --> 23:14.717
No. I just got in.

23:14.760 --> 23:18.321
Five hundred hits!
Look at all these comments!

23:18.663 --> 23:22.030
Yeah, they're all about how your
jackass friend is really Daniel Meade.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.534
Oh, my God.

23:24.002 --> 23:26.664
And it's linked to, like, 100 websites.
How did this happen?

23:26.705 --> 23:29.105
Why did you write about that?
I told you not to.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.209
<i>I know, papi, I know. What do I do?</i>

23:31.376 --> 23:34.937
All right, just calm down. Is there
any chance Daniel hasn't seen it?

23:35.113 --> 23:37.013
I don't know.
He doesn't even read my blog,

23:37.048 --> 23:39.573
and he's not usually that into the web,
so maybe he didn't.

23:39.785 --> 23:41.719
So, any time your name appears
in the media,

23:41.753 --> 23:44.051
you'll hear a little bing
and receive a Google alert.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.447
Cool.

23:53.965 --> 23:56.661
Nope, he definitely saw it.

24:03.074 --> 24:05.804
Betty, what were you thinking,
posting a rant like that about me?

24:05.877 --> 24:09.677
It was thoughtless and inappropriate
and just stupid.

24:09.714 --> 24:12.376
You know whenever the media
sees my name it's a feeding frenzy.

24:12.417 --> 24:15.545
I didn't even use your name, Daniel.
Someone else figured it out.

24:15.587 --> 24:16.952
Well, you didn't make it hard.

24:16.988 --> 24:19.786
Oh, my God!
The new proofs just came in, and...

24:19.825 --> 24:22.089
Hi. Awkward.

24:24.396 --> 24:28.355
Look, Daniel, I'm sorry.
But this is all gonna blow over fast.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.368
You've had
way worse written about you.

24:30.402 --> 24:31.767
About how you were a womanizer...

24:31.803 --> 24:34.465
Yeah, but when they call me
a womanizer at least it sounds sexy.

24:34.506 --> 24:36.201
You just made me sound like a jerk.

24:36.641 --> 24:39.872
<i>Daniel, Suzuki, TMZ, and something
called The New York Times</i>

24:39.911 --> 24:41.640
are all on the line for you.
What should I do?

24:41.980 --> 24:43.106
I'll deal with it.

24:43.715 --> 24:45.307
Thanks a lot, Betty.

24:51.957 --> 24:53.481
- Hey.
- Oh.

24:53.959 --> 24:56.792
I was just practicing my moves.
There's a contest.

24:57.362 --> 24:59.091
Can I talk to you?

24:59.197 --> 25:00.994
Oh, my God. You know I lied.

25:02.300 --> 25:05.360
Okay, look, things haven't been
going so great for me lately.

25:06.071 --> 25:08.539
The truth is,

25:08.640 --> 25:12.701
my mom kicked me out, I've been
living under a turntable at Butter,

25:12.777 --> 25:14.005
my new eyes stink.

25:14.045 --> 25:18.709
I can only see out of the left corner
of the right eye, and I'm not 30.

25:20.118 --> 25:22.450
I'm 31!

25:22.487 --> 25:26.082
I just didn't want to tell you, 'cause
I didn't want you to feel bad for me.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.461
That's not what you wanted to
talk to me about, is it?

25:33.064 --> 25:34.122
What is it?

25:36.434 --> 25:37.458
It's okay.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.668
I just wanted to tell you that...

25:48.179 --> 25:50.147
You got promoted to...

25:50.181 --> 25:53.742
Overseer of the Closet?
That sounds major.

25:53.785 --> 25:55.013
So major.

25:55.053 --> 25:58.318
Which is why I need you
to always be in here,

25:58.390 --> 26:00.415
and never be seen
anywhere else in the office.

26:00.458 --> 26:01.584
Okay.

26:01.726 --> 26:05.924
Okay. So, your first assignment is...

26:08.300 --> 26:10.200
To read this,

26:10.235 --> 26:11.429
cover to cover.

26:11.469 --> 26:13.869
Yet another incentive
to get my eyes redone.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.097
Okay.

26:27.052 --> 26:28.144
Hi, everybody.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.748
Ms. Slater, I didn't expect you to be

26:30.789 --> 26:33.519
such a strong supporter
of breast cancer awareness.

26:33.558 --> 26:35.617
We girls have to stick together.

26:35.660 --> 26:41.189
Now, I must be going, so ta-ta.
Or should I say, "ta-tas"?

26:41.399 --> 26:42.991
Oh, my.

26:43.034 --> 26:47.164
That will bring the house down
at my office. Thanks again.

26:48.206 --> 26:49.468
Safe travels.

26:51.142 --> 26:52.871
Nicely done.

26:53.211 --> 26:56.703
At 3:00, you'll be giving an empowering
speech to that girl's troop,

26:56.748 --> 26:59.342
another legion of fools
I'd rather not suffer.

26:59.718 --> 27:03.085
Wow, you're meaner than
any version of you I could ever do.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.986
Well, I could make an effort to be liked,

27:05.023 --> 27:07.651
but I'd rather be hated
than inconvenienced.

27:07.692 --> 27:12.391
However, if you stick around and
shave again, seems I could have it all.

27:13.531 --> 27:16.056
No, no, no, Perez, listen to me. Look...

27:21.773 --> 27:22.865
Hey.

27:22.907 --> 27:26.638
Look, I know I can't take back what
I did, but I wrote a retraction, and...

27:26.678 --> 27:30.205
Really? Does it include an explanation
as to why you did all this?

27:30.248 --> 27:32.580
Because that's the one part
I really don't get, Betty.

27:33.418 --> 27:36.444
Look, I know you're mad and I'm sorry.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.718
But there's a reason that I did it.

27:40.091 --> 27:41.683
You really hurt my feelings.

27:41.726 --> 27:44.354
Your feelings?
Betty, this isn't about your feelings.

27:44.396 --> 27:47.422
This is about you doing
serious damage to my reputation

27:47.465 --> 27:50.127
as the head of Meade Publications!

27:50.168 --> 27:52.932
I know you think you and your award
are the center of the universe,

27:52.971 --> 27:55.701
but you have to wake up.
It's not a big deal.

27:58.943 --> 28:03.039
Forget it. Forget my retraction,
forget my apology,

28:03.081 --> 28:05.072
forget I ever asked you
to present the award.

28:05.116 --> 28:07.607
Because if that's how you feel,
I really don't want you there anyway.

28:07.652 --> 28:09.779
Fine, that's the last place
I'd ever want to be.

28:18.930 --> 28:21.694
Betty, you're blowing up! It's awesome!

28:21.733 --> 28:24.896
With all this extra press,
the Blobbies are gonna be huge!

28:24.936 --> 28:26.164
And we have
the greatest thing planned.

28:26.204 --> 28:28.468
- When Daniel gets on stage...
- Daniel's not coming.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.971
But he has to.

28:30.008 --> 28:31.566
We planned a protest.

28:31.843 --> 28:33.401
When Daniel gets up
to present the award,

28:33.445 --> 28:36.175
we're gonna pelt him
with pairs of red glasses and burritos.

28:37.182 --> 28:38.479
I know it sounds a little bit offensive,

28:38.516 --> 28:40.450
but only the Latinas
will throw the burritos,

28:40.485 --> 28:41.747
so it's totally PC.

28:42.587 --> 28:45.215
Daniel's not coming. I'll find
someone else to present the award.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.086
Really? You can find another celebrity
at the last minute?

28:48.126 --> 28:49.593
Well, I don't know about that.

28:49.627 --> 28:52.095
But you said the Blobbies
weren't about celebrities.

28:52.130 --> 28:54.963
Yeah, but I just said that to sound
cool when I thought we had one.

28:54.999 --> 28:57.661
We need a celebrity, Betty.
Isn't there somebody you can get?

28:59.838 --> 29:02.966
<i>Mode magazine, please hold.
Mode... No, you hold!</i>

29:03.007 --> 29:05.475
Okay, sorry. Hi. Daniel, sorry.

29:05.510 --> 29:06.977
Okay, I'm coming right now. Okay.

29:07.011 --> 29:08.979
Mandy, why did I just see Helen
in the Closet,

29:09.013 --> 29:10.708
<i>reading a four-year-old Marie Claire</i>

29:10.749 --> 29:14.412
and wiping Cheeto dust off of
her fingers with a vintage Prada shift?

29:14.452 --> 29:17.888
Marc, I tried to fire her, but I couldn't.
And I knew if Willie saw her...

29:17.922 --> 29:20.117
What happens
when she asks about a paycheck?

29:20.158 --> 29:22.126
I give her Meade money.

29:22.694 --> 29:27.996
Mandy, a fake job and a fake paycheck
aren't helping Helen any.

29:28.133 --> 29:32.365
And trust me, no good ever came
from keeping someone in the closet.

29:33.438 --> 29:34.871
Okay, you just got really deep.

29:34.906 --> 29:36.533
I know. And now I have a headache.

29:36.574 --> 29:38.041
It's Willie. Look busy.

29:38.076 --> 29:40.772
I had such a good time with you girls.

29:40.812 --> 29:43.474
Next time we'll make
macadamia nut brownies.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.541
Nice seeing you, girls.

29:47.585 --> 29:49.815
Bye, Wilhelmina!

29:52.257 --> 29:56.489
That was nice, watching me
bring a smile to all those little faces.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.394
Damn my cha-cha heel.

30:04.169 --> 30:06.103
Maybe J-Lo is good...

30:08.473 --> 30:09.633
Ask Wilhelmina. She'd be perfect.

30:09.674 --> 30:13.110
No, Wendy, wait! I can't ask her.
She doesn't do anything for anybody.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.668
We can at least ask.

30:14.712 --> 30:16.339
She's gonna crush you!

30:17.615 --> 30:19.105
Ms. Slater?

30:19.150 --> 30:20.549
What is it, Betty?

30:20.585 --> 30:21.609
I'm not Betty.

30:21.653 --> 30:22.984
Of course you aren't. What is it?

30:23.721 --> 30:27.817
My organization, BLOB, is honoring
Betty with a Blobby Award tonight

30:27.859 --> 30:30.828
and it would mean so much to us
if you would present it to her.

30:33.932 --> 30:35.331
I'd be delighted.

30:36.935 --> 30:39.233
- Really?
- I wouldn't miss it for the world!

30:40.338 --> 30:44.365
See? I told you! Thank you!
She's really nice.

30:45.743 --> 30:47.233
Why would you agree to that?

30:47.278 --> 30:49.940
Because it's more fun
to watch you do it for me.

30:49.981 --> 30:51.209
Tonight? I can't.

30:51.249 --> 30:53.217
Why not? I pay you.

30:53.251 --> 30:56.015
And you don't have a show
to perform anymore, do you?

31:02.227 --> 31:05.162
So I don't have a super-secret job?

31:07.332 --> 31:09.027
And these...

31:09.067 --> 31:12.161
The supermarket won't take
these Daniel Dollars?

31:12.737 --> 31:14.261
I'm so sorry, Helen.

31:14.739 --> 31:18.766
It's okay.
You've been a good friend, Amanda.

31:18.810 --> 31:20.710
And sleeping at Butter isn't so bad.

31:22.180 --> 31:25.081
Sometimes DJ Omar
puts a pillow out for me.

31:36.995 --> 31:42.194
Is it just me or does a cold gust of wind
actually pick up when you approach?

31:58.016 --> 31:59.483
Hey, what are you still doing here?

31:59.517 --> 32:02.247
You're gonna be late
for Betty's big fat Mexican award show.

32:02.287 --> 32:03.447
I'm not going.

32:03.488 --> 32:04.978
Why, because Betty didn't want you?

32:05.023 --> 32:08.424
No, because I don't want to be there.
Not after she humiliated me.

32:08.459 --> 32:10.188
Only after you humiliated her.

32:10.228 --> 32:12.458
Amanda, I wasn't trying to
humiliate her.

32:12.497 --> 32:14.397
Besides, it doesn't matter. I'm her boss.

32:14.432 --> 32:16.992
It isn't her place
to challenge my behavior.

32:17.902 --> 32:20.700
Oh, my God, Daniel,
you sound like such a douche.

32:20.738 --> 32:22.797
Okay, I'm not saying that
as your employee,

32:22.840 --> 32:24.603
I'm saying it as your fun buddy.

32:24.642 --> 32:27.975
And I'm also gonna say that I think
you were trying to humiliate Betty,

32:28.012 --> 32:29.775
because you're threatened
by her success.

32:30.648 --> 32:32.445
- I'm threatened by Betty?
- Yeah.

32:32.483 --> 32:35.350
That's crazy.
I'm the editor-in-chief of a major...

32:40.792 --> 32:42.157
God.

32:42.193 --> 32:45.162
See? I can be
very perceptive sometimes.

32:45.196 --> 32:47.391
- Call me a car.
- Sure. Where you going?

32:51.135 --> 32:53.399
Thank you
so much for inviting me here.

32:53.438 --> 32:56.430
It's an honor and a pleasure
to be with you all tonight,

32:56.474 --> 32:59.637
in celebration
of this little lady right here.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.612
I love Betty Suarez.

33:02.914 --> 33:04.814
Who the hell is that?

33:04.849 --> 33:06.578
I don't know,
but if you don't talk to Grandpa,

33:06.617 --> 33:08.346
she's gonna be your new step mom.

33:08.386 --> 33:10.081
Because we're all people, aren't we?

33:10.121 --> 33:11.645
I give up. I don't care anymore.

33:11.689 --> 33:13.850
This thing has turned
into such a train wreck.

33:13.891 --> 33:15.688
She thinks it's a train wreck?

33:15.727 --> 33:18.628
We're the ones who bought
all these burritos for nothing.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.358
I don't even think
that's Wilhelmina Slater.

33:20.398 --> 33:21.695
Shut up, Dawn.

33:21.733 --> 33:24.964
Which is why I'm thrilled to be
presenting her with this award tonight.

33:25.003 --> 33:28.166
Excuse me, I think I'm supposed
to be presenting this award.

33:28.206 --> 33:30.037
Oh, my God, it's Daniel.

33:31.576 --> 33:33.373
- Yes!
He actually showed up.

33:33.644 --> 33:35.703
Go for it, honey. I have a show to go to.

33:35.947 --> 33:40.008
She runs a magazine, does a show,
and still has time to look like that?

33:44.822 --> 33:48.383
Don't stress-eat those burritos just yet,
you guys. It's about to get really fun.

33:56.100 --> 33:57.931
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:57.969 --> 33:59.960
- How'd it go?
- Well, the bad news is,

34:00.004 --> 34:01.494
she was crushed.

34:01.773 --> 34:04.435
The good news is,
we've got a new roomie!

34:05.543 --> 34:06.635
Hi, doll.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.312
I can't wait to spoon with you tonight.

34:13.751 --> 34:15.081
I'm just kidding.

34:15.585 --> 34:18.918
I'm not kidding. Is that apricot?

34:20.024 --> 34:21.184
It's...

34:23.194 --> 34:24.320
I've got to pee.

34:29.667 --> 34:30.725
Good evening.

34:33.771 --> 34:34.795
Jerk!

34:35.505 --> 34:37.996
I always say, never follow a drag act.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.000
I almost didn't come here tonight.

34:40.043 --> 34:41.670
- We don't want you!
- Yeah, get out of here.

34:43.313 --> 34:46.112
Because the woman
I'm about to introduce to you,

34:46.150 --> 34:49.347
I respect and admire and adore,

34:49.387 --> 34:51.786
also happens to intimidate
the hell out of me.

34:52.123 --> 34:54.420
This may come as a surprise to her,

34:54.458 --> 34:57.394
but it shouldn't have
come as a surprise to me.

35:00.364 --> 35:02.628
Betty Suarez has done more
in three and a half years

35:02.667 --> 35:04.498
than I've done in my entire life,

35:05.503 --> 35:07.767
which is why I couldn't help
but feel a little threatened.

35:09.240 --> 35:13.142
Betty is a force of nature.
A positive one, like sunshine,

35:13.177 --> 35:14.804
but a force nonetheless.

35:15.213 --> 35:18.114
I think we're all very lucky
to have her shining on us.

35:22.220 --> 35:23.983
Okay, that hurt.

35:25.189 --> 35:28.056
<i>Quiet, lady.
No one talks over Manna Wintour.</i>

35:28.292 --> 35:33.753
<i>Now, in my fabulous documentary,
September Issue...</i>

35:34.532 --> 35:37.194
<i>That's right,
you bitches better have seen it.</i>

35:37.502 --> 35:42.132
<i>André Leon Talley calls me
the biggest woman in fashion.</i>

35:42.173 --> 35:45.734
<i>Obviously, he's taken himself
out of the running.</i>

35:45.776 --> 35:49.041
I am sick of your excuses, Wilheldiva.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.449
If you're not here now,
don't bother coming in at all.

35:52.717 --> 35:53.877
I'll be there in a second.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.517
Give me that phone.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.019
Whoa!

35:57.054 --> 35:58.578
That was fast.

35:59.257 --> 36:00.884
<i>Thank you. Good night!</i>

36:01.492 --> 36:03.255
All right!

36:03.294 --> 36:06.889
What are you doing? I told you
never to perform your show again!

36:07.031 --> 36:08.430
Ms. Slater?

36:08.866 --> 36:10.595
<i>I was only gonna do it one more time.</i>

36:10.635 --> 36:12.933
Please, this is my life.

36:13.504 --> 36:15.563
What do I care about your life?

36:15.606 --> 36:17.904
<i>Wilheldiva Hater!</i>

36:19.443 --> 36:20.842
Enough with you!

36:23.147 --> 36:25.741
Get that thing off me! Get it off!

36:26.050 --> 36:27.950
What's going on?
Is this part of the show?

36:28.419 --> 36:31.081
There is no show, honey.
I'm no drag queen.

36:31.656 --> 36:34.147
Then why can I see
your package from here?

36:34.659 --> 36:36.149
Shut up, Claire.

36:37.995 --> 36:39.622
- We want a show!
- Yeah!

36:39.664 --> 36:41.256
- What?
- Move it, buddy!

36:41.299 --> 36:42.391
- Get off me!
- Go!

36:42.433 --> 36:43.457
Marc!

36:44.268 --> 36:46.099
Damn, that girl lost weight!

36:50.541 --> 36:51.565
<i>Hell.</i>

36:53.177 --> 36:54.906
- So...
Go home, loser!

36:56.280 --> 37:01.047
It is my great pleasure
to present this award to Betty Suarez.

37:02.153 --> 37:03.882
Yeah, Betty!

37:43.861 --> 37:45.226
Thank you, Daniel.

37:47.665 --> 37:52.125
And thank you to everyone at the Black
and Latina Organization of Bloggers.

37:52.503 --> 37:55.336
Latina? I thought
the L stood for "lesbian. "

37:55.373 --> 37:56.397
That's what I thought.

37:56.440 --> 38:00.376
As proud as I am to be here today,
I just want to say that

38:00.411 --> 38:04.871
we're not here celebrating me tonight,
as much as we're here celebrating

38:04.949 --> 38:06.849
what blogs can do.

38:06.884 --> 38:11.014
Sure, they can be used
to thoughtlessly attack people

38:11.055 --> 38:15.253
from a seemingly safe vantage point,

38:16.961 --> 38:18.258
which is very regrettable.

38:21.132 --> 38:27.162
But they can also make it possible for
someone who has something to say,

38:27.238 --> 38:31.641
but doesn't have a TV station
or a major magazine,

38:32.076 --> 38:33.907
to still make their voice be heard.

38:33.944 --> 38:36.310
And I think that's really important.

38:36.881 --> 38:39.577
Even if it is just 71 people listening.

38:39.617 --> 38:42.279
Actually, it's 72.
I read it. It's really good.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.810
Let her talk, jerk!

38:44.655 --> 38:47.021
Please don't be mad at Daniel.

38:47.058 --> 38:51.688
All he did in his interview
was remind me of who I used to be.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.094
And that was really embarrassing.

38:55.933 --> 39:00.370
But now I realize
that I have to love that girl that I was,

39:01.439 --> 39:03.703
because she made me who I am now.

39:04.809 --> 39:07.801
That's why none of you
should be ashamed of who you are.

39:07.912 --> 39:12.110
Because the misfits and the weirdos
of today

39:12.149 --> 39:14.640
are the world-changers of tomorrow!

39:15.252 --> 39:16.810
- Who says we're weirdos?
Yeah!

39:16.854 --> 39:17.878
That's not what I meant.

39:17.922 --> 39:19.651
Homophobe! Get her!

39:19.690 --> 39:22.591
- I didn't...
- Betty! Get down!

40:19.116 --> 40:21.141
She's magnificent!

40:21.185 --> 40:22.584
Seems a little off to me.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.911
Really?

40:38.836 --> 40:42.101
I just came by to say thank you.
I've been getting calls all day,

40:42.139 --> 40:45.267
saying that I gave the performance
of a lifetime.

40:48.045 --> 40:49.239
Oh.

40:49.814 --> 40:50.940
Is that so?

40:50.981 --> 40:53.541
Apparently, I got off stage,

40:53.584 --> 40:55.643
demanded and got a raise,

40:55.686 --> 40:58.814
two additional nights per week,
and top billing.

40:59.356 --> 41:03.793
Well, you're a very talented performer.
And a shrewd negotiator.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.857
But why?

41:05.896 --> 41:10.458
- I thought you didn't want...
- Go ahead and do your little show.

41:11.602 --> 41:15.436
On one condition,

41:15.473 --> 41:17.100
that you let me give you
a new wardrobe.

41:17.141 --> 41:20.599
Wilheldiva Hater would never be
performing in tatty knockoffs.

41:22.746 --> 41:24.304
I can live with that.

41:24.682 --> 41:26.274
And,

41:26.317 --> 41:29.809
I may take one of those nights,
now and then.

41:33.924 --> 41:36.916
- Like her good side and her evil side.
- She played twin nuns?

41:36.961 --> 41:38.485
- Yeah.
- Hey. Finished up the interview.

41:38.529 --> 41:40.656
Oh, I thought we were
doing that together.

41:40.698 --> 41:43.428
Yeah, well, you inspired me
to take my game up a notch.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.760
Besides, I thought
you might be able to edit it,

41:45.803 --> 41:48.499
since you are the editor-in-chief
of an award-winning blog.

41:48.539 --> 41:52.600
I'm gonna go, and let you two
make love, or whatever it is you do.

41:53.978 --> 41:56.139
It's great. I'm sure it's perfect.

41:58.482 --> 41:59.506
Really?

42:01.819 --> 42:03.810
I would make a few changes.

42:04.388 --> 42:05.878
- Of course you would.
- But not a lot.

42:05.923 --> 42:09.518
Just a few things,
like you sort of overwrote the intro.

42:09.560 --> 42:13.223
- Is this gonna take a while?
- No. It's gonna be very quick.

42:13.264 --> 42:17.860
Just small changes.
Like, I don't think you need...
