WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.287
(HARVEY READING)

00:02.377 --> 00:03.833
| got approached today
by the New York Bar.

00:03.921 --> 00:04.955
The guy pretty much told me

00:05.047 --> 00:07.163
if we don't take Zane's name
down, they'll do it for us.

00:07.257 --> 00:09.123
If you can't tell me
who you are to him,

00:09.218 --> 00:10.800
maybe you can tell me
who he is to you.

00:10.886 --> 00:11.876
| just know that he's somebody

00:11.970 --> 00:14.086
that | can't seem to figure
out how to cut out of me.

00:14.223 --> 00:16.464
| know exactly what you two are
doing. Louis, before you jump...

00:16.558 --> 00:17.719
You were up all night
trying to figure out

00:17.809 --> 00:18.799
how you were gonna handle
the Zane situation.

00:18.894 --> 00:21.261
You're my lawyer. You knew
something, and you kept it from me.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.307
We've been over this. The reason
|... What we haven't been over

00:23.398 --> 00:25.139
is that | was forced
to lie yesterday.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.395
The longer we leave
his name up there,

00:26.485 --> 00:28.647
the more damage
we inflict on ourselves.

00:28.737 --> 00:29.818
No, I'm not doing it.

00:29.905 --> 00:31.816
The Bar tried to get me to
take over as managing partner.

00:31.907 --> 00:32.897
You're here to tell me
you're taking over.

00:32.991 --> 00:35.949
I'm here to tell you that if they
can do that, what else can they do?

00:36.036 --> 00:37.777
We need to put an end to this.
What are you talking about?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.157
I'm talking about
taking Robert's name down.

00:39.248 --> 00:40.283
What's going on here?

00:40.374 --> 00:42.160
If we don't do this,
this firm has no future.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.538
If you do this, you'll be
lucky if | don't go to the Bar

00:44.628 --> 00:46.289
and tell them
what really happened.

00:46.380 --> 00:49.463
This is a court order granting
me full control of your law firm.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.040
You can refuse, in which case

00:51.134 --> 00:54.217
the Bar will suspend every
partner in this firm for six months.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.257
You up for another round?

01:01.603 --> 01:04.436
You're probably the only one
here who could give me a real fight,

01:04.522 --> 01:07.140
but | doubt a workout
is why you texted.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.975
You always did call me
on my shit.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.022
So what's going on, Lucas?

01:11.113 --> 01:12.695
To put it bluntly,
| got fired.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.488
What? Last | heard
the job was going great.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.488
It was, but we just
missed out on a DOD contract.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.364
Which means they're
letting guys go.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.036
But only one
from my department.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.080
And the guy they're keeping
is the CEO's son-in-law.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.249
It's nepotism,
no two ways about it.

01:25.377 --> 01:28.290
It's more than that. It's a
lawsuit. | thought so, too.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.621
So you know any hotshot lawyers
that might be interested in my case?

01:30.716 --> 01:31.706
| might.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.333
Why don't we get breakfast?
You can fill me in.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.419
Okay, but if you're buying,
it better show up on my bill,

01:36.513 --> 01:38.095
because | didn't come
looking for charity.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.639
It's not charity.
It's called pro bono.

01:40.726 --> 01:42.763
Samantha...
Lucas, we served together.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.560
I'm not taking no
for an answer.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.733
Harvey, Donna.
What a pleasant surprise.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.936
Can | interest you
in some Weetabix?

01:54.573 --> 01:56.439
Wow. What are you wearing?

01:56.533 --> 01:58.069
What do you mean, what am |
wearing? It's my mankini.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.776
Your what now?
It's a Speedo.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.110
| wear it
instead of underwear.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.115
It's incredibly supportive.
Here, let me show you.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.742
Donna?
Louis, as much as we would

02:04.833 --> 02:07.825
love for you to show us how
supportive your underwear is,

02:07.919 --> 02:10.957
Harvey and | are here
to share some news

02:11.048 --> 02:12.630
about why we were together
the other morning.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.548
Yeah, | know why you were together.
You were worried about the firm.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.423
Except the firm isn't the reason
why Harvey came over the other night,

02:17.512 --> 02:20.220
and it's definitely
not why he stayed over.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.844
Wait, Harvey, you have
a problem with your plumbing?

02:22.934 --> 02:24.095
"Cause if you need to
use my shower...

02:24.186 --> 02:26.143
That's not what she's saying,
Louis, and...

02:26.229 --> 02:27.469
I'm never gonna
use your shower.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.271
It's got a steam feature!
Come on upstairs. I'll show you.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.348
Louis!

02:31.526 --> 02:32.516
Harvey and | are together.

02:32.611 --> 02:34.101
Yeah, | know you're together.
You're standing right in front of me.

02:34.196 --> 02:35.857
See? This is what
I'm talking about.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.437
| mean, like, how did he even
make it through law school?

02:37.532 --> 02:41.116
No, no, no, no, no. Harvey
and | are in a relationship.

02:42.621 --> 02:45.329
Oh, my God.
Yeah.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.497
And we didn't want to tell you
before because it wasn't the right time,

02:47.584 --> 02:49.450
but we're telling you now
because we're happy

02:49.544 --> 02:51.285
and we don't want to hide
that anymore.

02:51.380 --> 02:54.748
Especially not from
our partner and our friend.

02:54.841 --> 02:58.334
| really appreciate that, Harvey,
and | am so happy for you both.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.418
But?

02:59.805 --> 03:02.843
A proper celebration's gonna have to
wait because | have some news, too.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.219
What is it, Louis?

03:05.018 --> 03:06.008
We have a problem.

03:09.564 --> 03:10.770
How long is she gonna be here?

03:10.857 --> 03:11.972
| don't know.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.728
Apparently, it's left to
the Bar's discretion.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.059
Bullshit!

03:15.153 --> 03:16.643
There's no way
I'm letting the Bar

03:16.738 --> 03:19.321
move someone into my house
and tell me how to run it.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.861
What?
You know what.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.408
This never would've happened
if you just...

03:23.495 --> 03:24.485
Don't even say it.

03:24.579 --> 03:25.569
You don't even know
what | was going to say.

03:25.664 --> 03:26.995
| can take a guess.
You were gonna say

03:27.082 --> 03:28.789
this all happened
because of what Robert did.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.458
It happened because
of your collective choices.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.286
This is a private
meeting, Faye.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.166
Well, it's also
the perfect opportunity

03:35.257 --> 03:38.170
for me to introduce myself
to the firm's leadership,

03:38.260 --> 03:39.250
such as it is.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.468
Such as itis?
Ms. Paulsen,

03:41.555 --> 03:44.172
when a firm's out of control,
that starts at the top.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.223
And if you think you can
waltz right in here

03:46.309 --> 03:48.016
and start throwing around
accusations...

03:48.103 --> 03:49.935
Then how about we throw
around some facts?

03:50.021 --> 03:53.230
You've had two managing
partners disbarred in as many years,

03:53.316 --> 03:54.806
a junior partner go to prison,

03:54.901 --> 03:56.562
and if you think
anybody believes

03:56.653 --> 03:58.860
that you weren't a party
to that fraud, think again.

03:58.947 --> 03:59.937
But,

04:00.949 --> 04:01.939
as of today,

04:02.951 --> 04:05.818
I'm wiping the slate clean of
everything you've ever done.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.744
You have no proof
we've ever done anything.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.572
| have experience.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.374
And when there's this much
smoke, there's always fire.

04:12.461 --> 04:15.670
So if you want me gone, there's
only one way to make that happen,

04:15.756 --> 04:18.248
convince me you people
can be trusted to fly right.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.752
And if we don't?

04:19.843 --> 04:21.754
You mean if you continue
to cross lines?

04:23.513 --> 04:24.753
Then you'll be fired.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.382
You don't have the
authority to do that. Yes, | do.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.888
As | have the authority
to approve new cases,

04:29.978 --> 04:33.096
allocate resources, and just
about anything else | see fit.

04:33.190 --> 04:36.057
And the first order of business
is doing what you all should have.

04:36.151 --> 04:37.767
Taking Robert Zane's name
off that wall.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.898
No. That is not happening.

04:39.988 --> 04:43.652
If you think you have a say in the
matter, you haven't grasped the situation.

04:43.742 --> 04:46.074
If you so much as reach
for that name,

04:46.161 --> 04:49.324
you haven't grasped that
| will find something on you.

04:49.414 --> 04:53.373
And that mentality perfectly
underlines why | am here.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.667
And leaving that name up
sends the wrong message.

04:55.754 --> 04:56.915
It sends the message

04:57.005 --> 04:58.996
that we don't throw our
friends to the wolves.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.297
You want to throw your friend
a retirement party

05:01.384 --> 05:04.877
or help him launch a charter boat
company to show your support, be my guest.

05:05.347 --> 05:08.965
But that name
comes down today.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.636
| don't believe this. You're
just gonna let her do this?

05:13.730 --> 05:15.016
Samantha,
it's not our decision.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.938
Well, whether | stay
here or not is.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.561
So you can go to hell.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.104
Fortunately, I'm used
to reactions like that.

05:23.532 --> 05:27.321
So as | said to Louis
when he signed off on this,

05:27.410 --> 05:29.742
| suggest you start getting
used to doing things my way,

05:29.955 --> 05:31.741
because this isn't
the Wild West.

05:31.832 --> 05:35.245
And your days of operating
however the hell you want are over.

05:42.843 --> 05:46.086
(SINGING) See the money,
wanna stay for your meal

05:46.179 --> 05:49.217
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

05:49.307 --> 05:52.766
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

05:52.853 --> 05:56.141
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

05:56.231 --> 05:59.394
I'll even eat a bean pie
| don't mind

05:59.484 --> 06:01.225
Me and missy is so early

06:01.319 --> 06:02.980
Busy, busy making money

06:03.071 --> 06:04.061
All right!

06:04.155 --> 06:09.696
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

06:10.579 --> 06:12.320
The greenback boogie

06:15.667 --> 06:18.159
Don't bother, Harvey. I'm outta
here. This place is not for me.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.790
Samantha, you can't quit.
We need you.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.339
Well, she doesn't need me, and
she's the one calling the shots.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.382
And if you think just because you
gave me a client I'm going to stay here...

06:25.468 --> 06:28.802
Samantha, like it or not, the
world thinks Robert is dirty.

06:28.889 --> 06:32.473
People also think that the
apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.800
So if you leave, it's not
gonna look like a protest.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.806
It'll look like
what they all think is true.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.807
| just don't have itin me
to roll over to her, Harvey.

06:41.902 --> 06:42.937
I'm not asking you
to roll over.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.610
I'm asking you
to wait this thing out.

06:44.696 --> 06:45.857
Because the second she |leaves,

06:45.947 --> 06:47.437
we're gonna put his name
right back on that wall.

06:48.533 --> 06:51.400
And what about the fact she
gets approval over all new cases?

06:51.494 --> 06:53.155
Because | met with
an old friend this morning.

06:53.246 --> 06:57.240
He can't afford us, and there
is no way I'm not helping him.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.496
Then as far as I'm concerned,
you met with him last night,

06:59.586 --> 07:01.122
which means
it's not a new case.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.624
She has a problem with that,
she can take it up with me.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.214
Louis, we need to talk.
What is it?

07:09.304 --> 07:11.466
You didn't mention that you
signed off on this whole thing.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.967
What difference does it make?
| didn't have a choice.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.719
Yes, you did.
You could've used her

07:14.809 --> 07:17.221
to convince Harvey to take that name down.
Which, thanks to you, is happening anyway.

07:17.312 --> 07:18.302
Thanks to me?

07:18.396 --> 07:19.682
| don't see anybody else
in this room.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.059
And you weren't there
last night, Alex.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.690
If | had refused, they would've
suspended everybody's license

07:23.777 --> 07:25.393
for six months
right then and there.

07:25.487 --> 07:26.852
So do you want to keep
fighting with each other,

07:26.947 --> 07:28.153
or do you want to
start fighting her?

07:28.239 --> 07:30.025
There is no fighting her.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.447
Gretchen, please,
this doesn't involve you.

07:31.534 --> 07:32.899
Well, maybe it should.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.156
Since I'm the only one
who knows Faye Richardson.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.871
You know her?
Worked in her firm years ago.

07:37.958 --> 07:41.041
Back before she became
the Bar's special asshole.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.539
Word was when she was
managing partner,

07:43.630 --> 07:46.873
she found out her husband
crossed some kind of line.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.755
She stripped his name
off the wall and fired him.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.050
Damn.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.627
A woman who could do that
to her own husband

07:52.722 --> 07:54.008
isn't going to care
what we do to her.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.010
But she'll care about
what the Bar does.

07:56.601 --> 07:57.682
You got something?

07:59.187 --> 08:00.177
| might.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.854
And just how long is this
woman going to be here?

08:02.941 --> 08:06.605
Well, according to her, as
long as she deems it necessary.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.778
What is it, Katrina?

08:09.864 --> 08:12.947
This is exactly why | went to
Alex to take Robert's name down.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.991
Something like this
was bound to happen.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.739
Well, | can understand
how you feel that way,

08:16.830 --> 08:20.323
but at the time, standing by
Robert felt like the right thing to do.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.872
Am | interrupting?
| was actually heading out.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.747
Katrina Bennett. Faye
Richardson. Pleasure to meet you.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.085
Ms. Richardson.
Is there something you need?

08:33.179 --> 08:34.465
Please, call me Faye.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.638
| may be here
as a special master,

08:36.725 --> 08:38.466
but it doesn't mean we
can't be on a first name basis.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.892
Well, is there something
that | can do for you, Faye?

08:40.979 --> 08:44.813
| understand as COO you handle
administrative coordination?

08:44.899 --> 08:46.981
That's right. Are you
looking to get a secretary, or...

08:47.068 --> 08:50.151
I'm looking to schedule an exit
interview with Thomas Kessler.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.479
And why would you
want to meet with Mr. Kessler?

08:52.574 --> 08:54.986
Because this firm's
troubles started

08:55.076 --> 08:58.364
when it put Mr. Kessler's
interests above another client's.

08:58.455 --> 09:01.072
| don't understand
why someone they did that for

09:01.166 --> 09:02.372
would suddenly leave.

09:02.459 --> 09:05.872
And you think his reasons might
indicate an underlying problem?

09:05.962 --> 09:08.124
Do you think there's
an underlying problem?

09:08.214 --> 09:09.579
| get the feeling
you're really asking

09:09.674 --> 09:11.711
whether I'd tell you
if | thought there was.

09:12.761 --> 09:13.876
And what if | were?

09:15.138 --> 09:17.596
Faye, if you know anything
about me, you'd know that

09:17.682 --> 09:21.141
| have a reputation for solving
problems, not hiding them.

09:21.853 --> 09:24.971
Which is why | already sent
Mr. Kessler our exit survey,

09:25.065 --> 09:27.727
so when | get his responses,
| will forward them to you.

09:27.817 --> 09:28.978
Oh, please do.
In the meantime,

09:29.069 --> 09:32.061
I'd appreciate you
setting up that interview.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.987
| just explained...
| know.

09:34.074 --> 09:38.409
| just find face-to-face
meetings much more informative,

09:38.495 --> 09:39.485
don't you?

09:40.288 --> 09:41.278
| certainly do.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.535
I'll set that up.
Wonderful.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.162
Anytime tomorrow
should be fine.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.299
Harvey, we need to talk.
We sure do.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.422
And I'm sorry, Donna. | know
you're gonna disagree with me, but...

09:56.554 --> 09:59.262
That woman needs
to go. Now. What?

09:59.349 --> 10:00.339
What do you mean, what?

10:00.433 --> 10:01.844
That's what | was
gonna say. So”?

10:01.935 --> 10:03.801
So you're not gonna
try and talk me out of it.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.385
That's so unlike you.

10:05.647 --> 10:06.637
Huh.
Mmm.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.229
That is unlike me.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.932
Maybe you're not going to
try and talk me out of it

10:10.026 --> 10:11.812
because you're less
uptight since we, uh...

10:11.903 --> 10:13.519
Since we, what?

10:14.447 --> 10:16.063
Nothing. Since we nothing.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.147
That's right.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.983
Because if anybody
was uptight, it was you.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.317
But I'm the one
acting consistently.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.822
Okay, maybe | was uptight.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.995
Or maybe I've had it
with Faye's bullshit.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.664
| prefer my uptight theory.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.536
Well, | prefer that Faye
not find out that

10:27.627 --> 10:29.834
it wasn't Robert who broke
privilege, it was us.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.082
Wait, what are you
talking about?

10:31.172 --> 10:33.664
She just asked me to schedule
an exit interview with Thomas.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.044
Donna, we can't
let that happen.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.217
Thomas won't lie
for us again. | know!

10:37.303 --> 10:39.385
So the question is,
how do we stop it?

10:41.057 --> 10:44.300
Well, if we can't ask Thomas to
lie again, there's only one way out.

10:44.936 --> 10:47.894
Make it so he doesn't
have to talk to her at all.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.808
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Ms. Wheeler.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.399
Now, what's this about?
Let's see.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.402
How about nepotism
and wrongful termination?

11:00.827 --> 11:03.285
You're here
about Lucas Hodges.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.907
That was fast.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.955
Well, he's the only person
we've let go recently

11:07.041 --> 11:09.499
and we were perfectly
justified in our decision.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.497
Why don't we let
a judge decide that?

11:11.588 --> 11:13.795
You might want to
get your facts straight first.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.419
The facts are you needed
to cut someone loose

11:16.509 --> 11:19.672
and you chose to keep your son-in-law
over a more qualified employee

11:19.762 --> 11:21.252
who happens to be
a two-tour veteran.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.428
| know what he is.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.426
Then you should know
if you don't reinstate him,

11:24.517 --> 11:25.973
I'm gonna wrap Lucas
up in a flag,

11:26.060 --> 11:27.971
put him in front of a jury,
and then we'll see

11:28.062 --> 11:30.178
exactly how many
government contracts you get.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.934
Then we'll wrap you
in time cards

11:32.025 --> 11:35.984
and the medical bills we footed
for an employee that Lucas injured.

11:36.112 --> 11:40.231
What? Lucas was far
from perfect, Ms. Wheeler.

11:40.325 --> 11:43.943
He missed work at crunch time.
He didn't always even call in.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.448
Says the man trying to
get out of a lawsuit.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.701
You don't have a lawsuit
because we had cause.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.283
And if you don't believe me,
ask my secretary for his records.

11:51.377 --> 11:55.245
They'll show that he was erratic,
he was impossible to work with.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.251
For God's sakes,
one day someone startled him,

11:57.342 --> 11:58.582
he practically
attacked the man.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.132
And if that's true,

12:00.220 --> 12:02.052
why didn't you bring this up
when you let him go?

12:02.138 --> 12:05.096
Because | like Lucas,
so we said

12:05.183 --> 12:07.299
it was because of that contract
to give him a soft landing.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.385
But the truth is, we were
gonna fire him no matter what.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.723
So I'm sorry
that he lied to you,

12:13.816 --> 12:15.523
but the suit has no merit.

12:16.361 --> 12:19.570
You can show yourself out.

12:31.042 --> 12:34.160
Louis, if you're here about changing
our default font back to Helvetica,

12:34.254 --> 12:35.369
| already told you...

12:35.463 --> 12:38.330
I'm not here about that, Benjamin.
I'm here because of Faye Richardson.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.087
| just set up her firewall this
morning. What about her?

12:41.177 --> 12:42.167
She's an intruder.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.594
And she just fired a shot
across our beloved bow.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.513
Give me an order, Captain.
It's Admiral.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.716
And | want you to find
a loophole in the Bar's bylaws

12:49.811 --> 12:51.768
that | can use
to force them to remove her.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.346
But the Bar's bylaws are,
like, 1,000 pages long.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.646
3,000.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.065
And somewhere in there is a
technicality that'll get rid of that woman,

12:58.152 --> 13:00.644
and you're going to build
a program to find it.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.649
Louis, | don't know
if | can do that.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.356
Benjamin,

13:04.450 --> 13:07.033
our home is under attack,
and | can't defend it alone.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.952
| need you to do this, and
| need you to do it quietly.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.779
Now, can | count on you
or not, sailor?

13:11.207 --> 13:12.789
Aye-aye, Captain.
It's Admiral.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.457
Admiral, whatever.
That's right.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.921
| can't believe they're using
those days | missed against me.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.874
They're using them
because they constitute cause.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.424
The question is,
why didn't you tell me?

13:23.511 --> 13:24.672
It was a couple days
here and there.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.220
Lucas, | never saw you
be late to one exercise,

13:27.307 --> 13:28.889
one training session...
So what?

13:28.975 --> 13:31.637
So you know what.
The absences, the aggression,

13:31.728 --> 13:33.594
all worse during
high-stress periods.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.520
Look, Samantha...
You have PTSD, don't you?

13:35.606 --> 13:37.062
No, | do not.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.766
Check my medical records.
There's nothing in them.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.147
Because you never
saw a doctor?

13:41.237 --> 13:43.478
Of course | saw a doctor.
And why was that?

13:43.573 --> 13:44.813
Because | had
trouble sleeping.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.944
Because of nightmares,
flashbacks?

13:47.118 --> 13:48.199
| don't wanna talk about this.

13:48.286 --> 13:49.651
Well, we're gonna
talk about it

13:49.746 --> 13:52.113
because | can't defend you if
you're not being honest with me.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.196
Honest about what?

13:54.125 --> 13:56.116
About how there are nights
I'm afraid to close my eyes

13:56.210 --> 13:58.042
and days | never
get out of bed?

14:00.381 --> 14:01.542
Listen to me.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.250
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

14:06.137 --> 14:09.425
There are literally thousands of people
going through the exact same thing

14:09.515 --> 14:10.880
and once we get you
diagnosed, we can...

14:10.975 --> 14:13.137
I'm not getting diagnosed.
Lucas, it'll protect you.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.264
Samantha, | told them | didn't
want to be diagnosed back then.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.687
I'm not getting reclassified
now. That's the end of it.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.141
Wait a minute, you told them?
You told your psychiatrist?

14:20.234 --> 14:23.022
| didn't go to a psychiatrist.
| went to an MD.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.443
| begged him not to
put it in my record.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.067
He put it down as anxiety
and gave me pills.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.444
And they kept me
going through my tour.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.524
And once you got out?

14:29.619 --> 14:30.780
| thought it would get better.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.242
But it didn't.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.744
It got worse.
Well,

14:38.002 --> 14:40.960
if your employer won't pay,
maybe someone else will.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.706
(KNOCKS)

14:46.344 --> 14:47.505
Harvey.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.381
Thomas, do you mind
if | come in?

14:49.472 --> 14:51.213
| really don't think
we have much to talk about.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.139
Well, unfortunately, we do.

14:53.226 --> 14:57.845
Because, as a result
of that hearing,

14:57.939 --> 15:00.897
the Bar installed someone
to watch every move we make.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.600
And now she wants
to ask you why you're leaving.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.518
And you know
I'm not gonna lie again.

15:05.613 --> 15:08.321
Which is why I'm here
to ask you not to leave.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.944
You've gotta be joking.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.192
Just hear me out, please.

15:12.537 --> 15:13.948
You've been with us
a long time.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.700
And in that time
we've tripled your business,

15:16.791 --> 15:17.872
we've taken you public...

15:17.959 --> 15:20.166
And completely
betrayed my trust. No.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.290
| betrayed my own
client for you.

15:22.380 --> 15:25.498
| lost my friend
and my partner for you.

15:26.717 --> 15:30.961
And if I'd done
the technically right thing,

15:31.055 --> 15:32.420
you'd have lost
your expansion.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.889
Now, I'm not saying
we didn't make mistakes,

15:34.976 --> 15:37.308
and | know | need to
earn back your trust.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.638
I'm just asking you to
give us a chance to do that.

15:42.650 --> 15:43.856
Let me ask you this.

15:48.364 --> 15:49.946
Who is Donna to you?

15:52.410 --> 15:55.027
She's the most important
person in my life, Thomas.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.612
And she knows it.

16:00.835 --> 16:01.825
When?

16:02.920 --> 16:04.376
The night | was cleared.

16:05.840 --> 16:06.830
Okay.

16:09.719 --> 16:10.709
Okay.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.008
I'll stay with your firm
on one condition.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.515
From now on you're
my lawyer, not Alex.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.309
Thomas, I'm not sure
that's the best idea.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.726
Well, it's the only one
that's gonna work for me

16:20.813 --> 16:22.395
because | don't trust
him anymore.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.389
And you were just
honest with me

16:24.484 --> 16:27.192
about the most difficult
guestion I'll ever ask.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.144
And you didn't flinch.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.232
Okay, but now that you
know the truth...

16:33.326 --> 16:34.566
| can get past all that.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.485
Are you sure?

16:38.080 --> 16:39.570
Yeah, I'm sure.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.962
Samantha, there you are.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.639
Whatever it is,
the answer is no.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.090
Well, that's too bad,

16:59.185 --> 17:01.142
because | just heard
you assigned an associate

17:01.229 --> 17:03.971
to subpoena military records
for a new case.

17:04.065 --> 17:06.978
So what if | did?
So, | want you to drop it.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.314
Excuse me?
As | mentioned this morning,

17:10.404 --> 17:12.145
| have approval
over all new matters,

17:12.240 --> 17:13.605
and this one has red flags
all over it.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.612
Well, | don't see any red flags, and
I'm not hanging my friend out to dry.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.444
The fact that he's a friend
is the red flag,

17:19.539 --> 17:22.998
because if you start to lose,
you may not fight the right way.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.574
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.285
But it doesn't matter,
because this case isn't new.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.460
| took it last night.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.960
You don't think | know
a cover story when | hear one?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.415
| don't care
what you think you know.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.421
| told Harvey about the case
when | took it,

17:34.512 --> 17:36.503
which means,
according to your own rules,

17:36.597 --> 17:39.089
you don't get a say as
to whether | drop this or not.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.550
Well, | do get a say
on the use of firm resources,

17:41.644 --> 17:44.136
in particular on the cases
that pay us nothing.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.595
So if you pursue this,

17:45.690 --> 17:47.272
you do this without
your expense account,

17:47.358 --> 17:49.019
our associates,
and anything else.

17:49.110 --> 17:52.319
And if | find out otherwise,
I'll drop the client myself.

17:58.828 --> 18:02.116
Let me get this straight. You want
my help to go after the military?

18:02.206 --> 18:05.039
Yes, but first | need access
to your expense account.

18:05.126 --> 18:06.116
Why?

18:06.210 --> 18:09.202
Because if I'm gonna get them to settle,
| need to hire Pls, expert witnesses...

18:09.297 --> 18:10.958
No, | mean why do you
need my account?

18:11.048 --> 18:14.291
Because Faye banned me
from using firm resources.

18:15.511 --> 18:19.630
So you don't just want my help,
you want me to defy a direct order?

18:19.724 --> 18:21.306
If we do it right,
she'll never know.

18:21.392 --> 18:22.473
Samantha, it's the military.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.801
There's no way they'll ever
give in before Faye finds out.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.852
Fine, | will use
my own money for expenses,

18:26.939 --> 18:28.646
but | can't do it
all on my own.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.474
I'm working without
an associate myself right now.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.775
Katrina, it's not easy
for me to ask for this.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.524
And it's not easy
for me to say no.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.606
Don't you get it?
| cannot let him down.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.699
Lucas and | didn't
just train together.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.031
We served together.

18:47.293 --> 18:51.662
And after my four years, he
asked me to stay, but | didn't.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.339
| got out.
He did two more tours.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.342
And in his head,
he is still there

18:58.429 --> 19:03.048
while | wear $2,000 dresses
and negotiate million-dollar deals.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.136
All right. I'll help you.

19:07.772 --> 19:09.604
On two conditions.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.272
We do it on the up-and-up,

19:12.401 --> 19:14.267
and we pick a fight
we can win.

19:21.952 --> 19:25.490
| know things are rough, Harvey,
but shots for breakfast with my Scotch?

19:25.915 --> 19:27.622
One of them is for you.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.120
And they're not because of
bad news, but because of good.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.201
Then lay it on me.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.457
Because it is past time
| heard something good.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.912
| got Kessler to stay.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.374
He's gonna come in today and
sign a new engagement letter.

19:37.468 --> 19:40.460
No shit. That is good. I'll call
him right now, set up a meeting.

19:40.554 --> 19:44.297
That's the thing, Alex.
He wants me to represent him.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.470
You?
Yes.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.177
And before you say it, |
was as surprised as anyone.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.763
Harvey, surprised is what you
feel when you come home

19:51.857 --> 19:53.473
and your friends are there
for your birthday,

19:53.567 --> 19:55.433
not when you find out your
partner's taking your client.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.565
Look, | know it's not ideal, but
what do you want me to say?

19:57.655 --> 19:59.237
This is his condition
for staying.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.654
| don't want you
to say anything,

20:00.741 --> 20:03.483
but | also don't want you to come in here
and try to tell me this is a celebration.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.739
You're right.
It's not a celebration.

20:05.830 --> 20:08.948
But Faye wanted to ask him
why he left, and we can't have that.

20:13.796 --> 20:15.036
FAYE: Ms. Bennett,

20:15.715 --> 20:19.709
I'm not one for small talk,
so I'll jump right in.

20:19.802 --> 20:22.544
| saw you added yourself
as attorney of record

20:22.638 --> 20:25.505
on Ms. Wheeler's case.
| did.

20:25.850 --> 20:29.093
And did she inform you that
| specifically forbade her

20:29.186 --> 20:30.893
from using firm resources?

20:30.980 --> 20:32.641
Yes, she did.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.848
Which is why | worked
on my own time,

20:34.942 --> 20:38.276
and | won't be attending a
deposition scheduled for today.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.818
| respect that.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.237
It shows a willingness
to work within the rules.

20:42.324 --> 20:46.238
But I'd like to explain why |
didn't want her to take that case.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.820
Because she's
emotionally invested.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.540
And you're worried she'll be tempted
to do something that she shouldn't.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.537
And if you understand that,

20:54.628 --> 20:58.246
I'm sure you'll understand if you
really want to help Ms. Wheeler,

20:58.340 --> 21:00.331
you'll help her avoid
doing just that.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.342
How did Alex take it?

21:07.433 --> 21:09.299
He didn't love it,
but he'll live with it.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.677
So Thomas is coming
here today?

21:13.189 --> 21:14.896
Because Faye's gonna be asking
about that interview,

21:14.982 --> 21:17.314
and we need him to have signed
that engagement letter.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.732
Donna, he gave me his word.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.106
Great, then that means
that he'll be here.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.397
Hey, what's going on?

21:24.950 --> 21:27.282
Are you sure
this is the best idea?

21:28.370 --> 21:29.485
You representing him?

21:29.580 --> 21:30.820
| mean, what happens
the first time

21:30.915 --> 21:32.451
he doesn't like
something that you've done,

21:32.541 --> 21:34.202
or you think that
he's being short-sighted?

21:34.293 --> 21:36.705
How long before one of you
brings up what happened?

21:37.213 --> 21:40.922
Donna, he's a grown man.
It was his idea.

21:41.008 --> 21:44.376
If he thinks he can make it
work, I'm gonna trust him.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.886
How is it that you always

21:46.972 --> 21:49.339
make it feel like
everything's gonna be okay?

21:49.433 --> 21:50.844
Because I'm Superman.

21:50.935 --> 21:52.346
No, you're supposed to say,

21:52.436 --> 21:53.972
"l was just thinking
the same thing about you."

21:54.063 --> 21:55.974
But Superman wouldn't say
something like that.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.726
He'd just expect
Lana Lang to get it.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.728
Well, in case you haven't
noticed, I'm not Lana Lang.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.025
I'm Lois Lane.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.273
You have the best of both
because Lana was a redhead.

22:03.364 --> 22:06.277
Is that mushy enough for you?
'Cause I've got to go save Metropolis.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.401
Save Metropolis.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.954
You don't even know
your own phone number.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.786
Okay, people! Listen up.

22:17.503 --> 22:20.996
As you may know a new attorney
has joined us, Faye Richardson.

22:21.090 --> 22:24.173
And | would like you all
to give her a very,

22:24.260 --> 22:26.752
very warm welcome,
but don't bother her.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.713
Just give her a wide berth.
Any questions?

22:29.807 --> 22:30.968
Yes.

22:31.058 --> 22:34.301
You want us to make her
feel welcome by avoiding her?

22:34.395 --> 22:35.931
Excellent question, Susan.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.058
The answer is yes. Yes, | do.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.347
Um...

22:39.441 --> 22:40.431
Why?

22:41.151 --> 22:42.607
Another good question, Susan.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.858
Because as your leader,
| know what's best,

22:45.948 --> 22:48.940
and make no mistake,
| am your leader.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.446
Okay, but...
No one likes a talker, Susan.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.323
Any other questions? No?

22:53.414 --> 22:55.246
Great.
MAN: | have a question.

22:55.708 --> 22:56.698
Why is she here?

22:56.792 --> 22:58.282
Is she heading up
a new division or something?

22:59.086 --> 23:00.076
Sort of.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.036
She's actually
an ethics expert.

23:03.007 --> 23:04.668
In light of recent events,
| thought it would be wise

23:04.758 --> 23:07.295
to bring someone in to
buttress the firm's reputation.

23:08.512 --> 23:11.880
Actually, truth is,
she was reluctant to come...

23:12.683 --> 23:14.799
Oh. Don't let me
interrupt, Louis.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.477
You were saying
| was reluctant to come here.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.305
Maybe not reluctant...
But it was your idea.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.935
Isn't that what you said?

23:22.026 --> 23:24.233
And you would never lie to
your associates, would you?

23:24.320 --> 23:27.028
Framing things in context
isn't lying, Faye.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.947
Then let me ask a question
that needs no context.

23:30.034 --> 23:34.073
The Bar's leadership had doubts
about your ability to follow the law,

23:34.496 --> 23:35.736
and that's why I'm here.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.871
Isn't that the case?

23:39.919 --> 23:40.909
Yes.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.124
Thank you for helping me

23:44.214 --> 23:46.831
get off on the right foot
with the associates, Louis.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.257
| appreciate it.

23:56.477 --> 23:58.718
Alex, not now.
Yes, now,

23:58.812 --> 24:00.849
because Bromwell just told me
they're being sued again.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.897
Shit, we just got them off.
| know that.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.441
And to make matters worse,
we drew Judge Dorsey.

24:05.527 --> 24:07.859
God damn it! What?

24:07.947 --> 24:09.403
Louis, do you have a minute?

24:09.490 --> 24:12.858
Because I've hit a snag
with our new server problem.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.613
Cut the code.
Alex is on our side.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.535
In that case,
| need a digital copy

24:16.622 --> 24:18.863
of the Bar's bylaws, but
they're password protected.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.540
Scan the ones | gave you.
| tried that, but...

24:20.626 --> 24:22.333
Are you shitting me?

24:22.419 --> 24:24.786
You can't even scan a simple
document without screwing up?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.166
It wasn't my fault.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.872
Well, it isn't my fault
that we're in this situation,

24:27.967 --> 24:31.255
but here | am, busting my ass,
getting humiliated.

24:31.345 --> 24:35.134
And the one person that | ask to help
me can't even tie his own goddamn shoes.

24:35.224 --> 24:38.967
So | don't care what it takes,
get that copy and get it today.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.595
But... Benjamin,
give us a few minutes.

24:44.358 --> 24:46.725
Okay, Louis. What's going on?

24:46.819 --> 24:49.060
You know what's going on.
Yeah, | do.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.895
Because | bit my own
secretary's head off

24:50.990 --> 24:53.027
three seconds after getting
off the phone with Bromwell.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.111
Not to mention...
Not to mention what?

24:55.202 --> 24:56.738
Nothing. It's not important.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.116
What is important
is you and | are going out,

24:59.206 --> 25:00.617
and we're going out right now.

25:00.708 --> 25:03.200
Alex, | don't need to...
Yes, you do, and so do .

25:03.293 --> 25:05.955
Because if we don't blow off some
steam, one of us is gonna kill someone.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.162
Well, then, what do you suggest?
Because there's no opera today.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.544
| have not gotten my mud
membership card back yet.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.750
And unless there's a cat fair
that | don't know about,

25:12.845 --> 25:14.131
we have got nothing.

25:15.723 --> 25:17.555
| have just the thing.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.721
Mr. Daly, how many of your
employees are veterans?

25:21.812 --> 25:26.101
I'm proud to say anywhere from
30% to 40% at any given time.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.602
So it's safe to say

25:27.693 --> 25:29.855
you're familiar with the
struggles many veterans face.

25:29.945 --> 25:32.061
I'm afraid you'll have
to be more specific.

25:32.156 --> 25:35.114
Post-traumatic stress
disorder. Is that specific enough?

25:35.200 --> 25:37.532
Yes, I'm familiar,
but what's your point?

25:37.619 --> 25:41.453
My point is, do you think Lucas
Hodges suffers from PTSD?

25:41.540 --> 25:42.951
My client's
not a psychiatrist.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.703
He's the one who said
he's familiar with it.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.283
That doesn't
necessarily mean...

25:46.378 --> 25:50.622
You had his office furniture rearranged
so his back wouldn't face the door, Tom.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.081
And the only reason you would
do something like that

25:52.176 --> 25:53.666
is if you suspected the truth.

25:53.761 --> 25:56.173
Suspicion is not knowing.
Answer the question.

25:56.263 --> 25:59.255
Did you or did you
not suspect PTSD?

26:04.813 --> 26:07.305
Are you sure you want me
to answer that question?

26:07.399 --> 26:10.232
Because if you do, I'm
going to say, "Yes, | did."”

26:11.070 --> 26:15.735
And then I'm gonna demand proof
that he is a member of a protected class,

26:15.824 --> 26:18.862
which means an official
diagnosis on his permanent record.

26:19.745 --> 26:23.113
Is that really what your
client wants, Ms. Wheeler?

26:25.000 --> 26:26.240
We didn't think so.

26:27.086 --> 26:31.080
Which is why we're prepared to
offer a sealed settlement of $25,000.

26:31.173 --> 26:34.006
That isn't even a third of what
he was gonna make this year.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.499
That's the best
you're gonna get.

26:36.762 --> 26:39.174
Take the deal,
and let everyone walk away,

26:39.264 --> 26:42.097
or he can turn the camera back
on and answer your question.

26:46.396 --> 26:48.808
Our offer stands for 24 hours.

27:02.079 --> 27:03.319
(PINS KNOCKING)

27:03.413 --> 27:04.403
All right, so what,

27:04.498 --> 27:06.114
| just roll this thing down
there and knock over the sticks?

27:06.792 --> 27:07.782
Pins.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.082
How have you never
bowled before?

27:09.169 --> 27:13.288
Fourth grade, Joshua Hirshheiser
had a birthday bowling party.

27:13.382 --> 27:15.749
Before we even started, |
got my fingers stuck in the ball.

27:15.843 --> 27:17.834
They called me sausage fingers
till eighth grade.

27:17.928 --> 27:20.716
So what do | do? | just
throw... How do | throw it?

27:20.806 --> 27:22.672
Just walk to the line,
release it.

27:32.359 --> 27:34.942
That's okay.
Happens to everyone.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.235
Just try to keep
your arm straight.

27:37.322 --> 27:38.312
Ah!

27:45.497 --> 27:46.487
Shit!

27:48.250 --> 27:49.411
Maybe we should
try some bumpers.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.162
No! This is so stupid.

27:51.253 --> 27:52.243
If it weren't for the shoes,

27:52.337 --> 27:53.998
nobody would play
this ridiculous game at all.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.421
Okay, let's try granny style.

27:57.843 --> 28:00.255
Oh. Okay, yeah. No problem.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.225
God damn it!

28:08.312 --> 28:11.054
This is worse than when | lost
the junior wrestling championship!

28:11.148 --> 28:12.138
You wrestled?

28:12.232 --> 28:14.143
| don't know if you know this about
me, Alex, but | have a lot of rage.

28:14.234 --> 28:17.101
Wait a second.
Rage. That's it.

28:17.196 --> 28:20.939
Louis, | want you to imagine
Faye's face on all those pins.

28:21.909 --> 28:24.492
Imagine she's taking your firm
and laughing at you.

28:26.496 --> 28:28.282
Of course I'm taking
your firm, Louis.

28:28.373 --> 28:31.582
Because you're weak and
ineffectual, and you don't deserve it.

28:32.169 --> 28:33.409
Because you're nothing.

28:33.962 --> 28:36.294
You're a
sausage-fingered failure!

28:37.049 --> 28:38.289
(SCREAMING)

29:08.789 --> 29:09.779
(CLEARS THROAT)

29:09.873 --> 29:11.989
Excuse me, miss, I'm here to
sigh an engagement letter.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.370
Perhaps you could help me?

29:13.460 --> 29:15.451
Thomas! Right on time.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.001
What can | say?
I'm nothing if not punctual.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.295
Well, Louis always did say

29:18.382 --> 29:19.793
that it was one of your
many stellar qualities.

29:19.883 --> 29:22.295
Oh, really? And what were
some of my others?

29:22.386 --> 29:23.797
Loyalty.

29:23.887 --> 29:26.379
Integrity. Height.
Height?

29:26.473 --> 29:28.714
What can | say? Louis prizes
what he doesn't have

29:28.809 --> 29:30.595
and the fact that you've got
that full head of hair?

29:30.686 --> 29:32.677
That makes you
practically a god.

29:35.315 --> 29:38.853
Well, as much as | could talk
about my stellar qualities all day...

29:38.944 --> 29:41.982
If we do that, then this
engagement letter won't sign itself.

29:42.698 --> 29:43.984
No, it won't.

29:45.492 --> 29:47.859
Well, all you have to
do is sign it,

29:47.953 --> 29:50.320
and | will make sure that
Harvey gets it right away.

29:50.414 --> 29:52.200
Onh, it's okay, Donna.
| can drop it off.

29:52.291 --> 29:55.329
He and | have some business
to discuss, anyway.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.876
It was good
to see you, Thomas.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.211
It was good to see you too.

30:06.263 --> 30:08.425
| can't believe you bowled
a perfect game!

30:08.515 --> 30:10.176
| can't believe
they didn't have rosé.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.008
So | see you went with pifia
colada instead.

30:12.102 --> 30:13.388
Never disappoints.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.015
Thanks for bringing
me here, Alex.

30:15.981 --> 30:18.814
| haven't felt this
relaxed in days.

30:19.568 --> 30:23.186
It's like ever since she got here, I've
been on the outside of my own firm.

30:23.280 --> 30:26.113
Believe it or not, Louis,
| know exactly how you feel.

30:26.199 --> 30:27.314
When | first got to the firm,

30:27.409 --> 30:30.197
| thought Harvey and | were going
to be like Stockton and Malone.

30:30.912 --> 30:33.904
But, for whatever reason,
that didn't happen.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.956
Then | thought | was
getting my name on the wall,

30:36.043 --> 30:39.252
and | found myself in a death
match with Samantha instead.

30:40.213 --> 30:42.295
| was no picnic either.
Mmm.

30:42.883 --> 30:44.089
No, you were not.

30:44.426 --> 30:47.509
But the thing is, all that
happened, and I'm still standing.

30:47.929 --> 30:52.014
And, Louis, when this is done,
you'll be standing, too.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.431
We'll be standing.

30:55.062 --> 30:56.052
So,

30:58.440 --> 30:59.930
about this wrestling thing.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.149
Not many people know.

31:03.403 --> 31:06.441
When | told Harvey, he got
me a onesie for my birthday.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.398
You ever wear it?

31:09.493 --> 31:10.733
That's not the point.

31:10.827 --> 31:11.817
Well,

31:12.996 --> 31:15.454
since we're talking about
things people don't know,

31:15.540 --> 31:16.530
| tap.

31:16.958 --> 31:17.948
No way.

31:24.007 --> 31:28.376
Holy shit! How? When?

31:29.179 --> 31:30.795
My mom made me take lessons
when | was a kid.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.927
| don't believe it.
You have cats, you dance.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.678
You might be the manliest man
I've ever met.

31:35.769 --> 31:38.477
Well, what do you say we keep
my manliness between us?

31:38.563 --> 31:39.849
Oh, please, say no more.

31:39.940 --> 31:42.978
I've had to downplay my
masculinity in front of Harvey for years.

31:43.068 --> 31:45.981
I'm sure you have, Louis.
I'm sure you have.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.061
Hmm.

31:48.532 --> 31:50.569
Well?
Well, what?

31:50.659 --> 31:53.196
How did it go?
Shitty.

31:53.286 --> 31:56.153
They offered us $25,000
and said if we want more,

31:56.248 --> 31:58.455
we'll have to go on record
with an official diagnosis.

31:59.209 --> 32:02.998
Okay, if they're offering that, we
can probably get them up another 25.

32:03.088 --> 32:05.830
$50,000 isn't enough.
| want 500.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.131
Samantha, that's never going
to happen. We have no leverage.

32:08.218 --> 32:09.208
So we'll get some.

32:09.302 --> 32:10.838
You're going to blackmail him?

32:10.929 --> 32:12.590
I'm gonna do right
by my client.

32:12.681 --> 32:16.219
And if you think extorting a settlement
is doing right by your client, then...

32:17.769 --> 32:19.351
Faye was right, you shouldn't
have taken this case.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.803
(SCOFFS)
| don't believe this.

32:21.356 --> 32:24.474
She got to you.
No, Samantha, | got to me.

32:24.568 --> 32:27.356
And what you're talking about
is exactly the type of thing

32:27.446 --> 32:29.528
that got us handcuffed to her
in the first place.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.606
And if you think | asked for your help
so you could be little Sally Girl Scout...

32:32.701 --> 32:35.113
| think you're letting
your guilt blind you

32:35.203 --> 32:37.035
to what Lucas really needs,

32:37.122 --> 32:39.705
which is treatment
for his condition.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.075
You don't think | know that?

32:42.169 --> 32:46.379
| tried, but | can't make him
get help any more than | could...

32:47.257 --> 32:50.750
Samantha, | understand
what you're feeling.

32:50.844 --> 32:53.802
But this isn't the way
to help your friend.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.056
(SIGHS)

33:03.231 --> 33:06.144
Donna, there you are. |
was looking all over for you.

33:06.610 --> 33:11.320
Listen, | wanted to tell you how
sorry | am about the other morning.

33:11.406 --> 33:12.567
Am | missing something?

33:13.116 --> 33:14.231
What do you have to
be sorry about?

33:14.326 --> 33:17.193
Well, you and Harvey came
to me with wonderful news,

33:17.287 --> 33:19.870
and | got so caught up
with the firm situation,

33:19.956 --> 33:22.197
that | really didn't get a chance
to say how happy | am for you.

33:22.292 --> 33:23.703
That's really thoughtful
of you, Louis,

33:23.793 --> 33:25.124
but | completely understood.

33:25.212 --> 33:26.577
All the same.
You're my friend.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.958
Monumental thing happened
for you, and...

33:30.091 --> 33:31.422
| want to hear all about it.

33:32.219 --> 33:33.926
You mean girl talk?
You know it.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.053
Which means | want
to hear how it happened.

33:36.139 --> 33:37.129
| will tell you.

33:37.224 --> 33:38.385
When it happened.
All the details.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.554
What was it like? Okay, I'm
shutting this down right now.

33:40.644 --> 33:41.884
No, Donna, | don't
mean like that.

33:42.812 --> 33:44.268
| just want to do
a side-by-side comparison

33:44.356 --> 33:45.562
of Harvey's style to mine.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.145
What is wrong with you?
Okay, fine.

33:49.611 --> 33:50.601
I'm sorry.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.231
What | mean to say is...

33:52.322 --> 33:53.562
I'm thrilled for you.

33:54.866 --> 33:58.905
I'm even happier for Harvey.
Oh! Really? And why is that?

33:58.995 --> 34:02.033
Because you're the best thing
that's ever happened to him.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.915
And he finally knows it.

34:06.586 --> 34:08.452
That's the sweetest thing
you've ever said to me.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.880
Does this mean you'll reconsider
describing Harvey's technique to me?

34:12.676 --> 34:14.337
All right, then we'll
do it later.

34:16.763 --> 34:19.505
You are not gonna believe
what Louis just tried to...

34:19.599 --> 34:21.215
Thomas backed out, Donna.

34:22.643 --> 34:23.634
What?

34:23.728 --> 34:26.561
He said he thought he could
handle it, but he couldn't.

34:26.648 --> 34:29.436
Harvey, | told Faye
that he was signing with us.

34:29.525 --> 34:31.641
This means that he's gonna...
| know what it means.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.858
She's gonna want to
go back to interviewing him.

34:35.991 --> 34:38.027
No. She won't.

34:39.619 --> 34:41.451
"Cause I'm gonna tell
her the truth.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.541
Donna, what can | do for you?

34:52.924 --> 34:54.335
You can listen.

34:55.802 --> 34:57.634
And hopefully understand.

34:58.638 --> 34:59.673
Understand what?

34:59.764 --> 35:01.596
Why Thomas Kessler left.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.638
| was under the impression
it didn't matter

35:04.728 --> 35:06.435
when you told me
he was coming back.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.886
He's not.

35:07.981 --> 35:10.097
And the reason he's not
is the same reason he left.

35:12.068 --> 35:15.652
Thomas wasn't just a client.
He and | were in a relationship.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.605
Were?
Yes.

35:17.699 --> 35:20.737
We ended it a few days ago, and
you can ask him about it yourself,

35:20.827 --> 35:23.364
but you would just be
making him reopen a wound

35:23.455 --> 35:24.695
that he is trying to close.

35:25.290 --> 35:27.372
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

35:27.459 --> 35:31.373
Have you ever been in a relationship
that you thought would last but didn't,

35:31.463 --> 35:33.249
and when it ended,

35:33.340 --> 35:37.834
there was collateral damage
that you never could've anticipated,

35:37.927 --> 35:39.634
but still felt
responsible for?

35:45.393 --> 35:46.599
That's why.

35:48.063 --> 35:50.304
You can cancel
the interview, Donna.

35:51.733 --> 35:54.395
And thank you
for telling me the truth.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.150
What's that?

36:03.828 --> 36:07.116
It's a settlement offer
for $25,000.

36:07.207 --> 36:09.323
| don't want a settlement.
| want my job back!

36:09.417 --> 36:10.953
Lucas, listen to me.

36:12.128 --> 36:15.416
(SIGHS) It took me a long time to
admit that sometimes | need help.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.625
And right now you need
professional help.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.671
You're not gonna get out of this
hole without... (METAL CLANKS)

36:20.762 --> 36:23.595
Damn it, | told you!
| know what you told me.

36:24.307 --> 36:25.468
But you're my friend.

36:25.558 --> 36:28.550
You're still living back there, and
| am not gonna leave you behind.

36:28.645 --> 36:30.261
What do you know about this?
You weren't even there!

36:30.355 --> 36:32.847
And | will feel guilty about
that for the rest of my life.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.691
But what I'm not gonna do

36:35.777 --> 36:40.522
is let you leave here
without signing this job offer.

36:40.657 --> 36:43.490
What? | thought
you couldn't... | can't.

36:44.953 --> 36:47.615
| created a corporation.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.573
That is a contract
between you and SW Industries.

36:51.626 --> 36:55.290
To the world, you have a job.
One year, the pay is $100,000.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.081
| can't take your money.

36:59.634 --> 37:01.466
It's not charity.

37:01.553 --> 37:05.922
If you don't get the help you
need, that contract is null and void.

37:08.435 --> 37:12.724
Lucas, | have only ever told
one other person this.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.808
| was beaten as a kid.

37:19.362 --> 37:21.899
And it took admitting that
| needed professional help

37:21.990 --> 37:23.151
to get over it.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.530
You've been to war.

37:35.837 --> 37:37.669
| told myself
| could handle it.

37:37.756 --> 37:38.871
You can.

37:41.050 --> 37:43.166
(SIGHS) You just can't
do it alone.

37:47.640 --> 37:48.630
(COFFEE MAKER WHIRRS)

37:48.933 --> 37:51.766
Mmm. That looks delicious.
Mind if | have some?

37:52.687 --> 37:54.394
You want some prunie?
| would.

37:54.481 --> 37:57.690
In fact, why don't you pour another glass
and we could take it down to Benjamin?

37:57.776 --> 37:59.392
He's been working so hard.

37:59.486 --> 38:00.851
Benjamin?
Mmm-hmm.

38:00.945 --> 38:02.902
Yeah, | was having a
little trouble with my email,

38:02.989 --> 38:04.900
so | went to get him,
and wouldn't you know it,

38:04.991 --> 38:07.198
| found him hip deep
in the Bar's bylaws.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.775
Well, you know,
Benjamin is an avid reader.

38:08.870 --> 38:13.080
Especially when he's given an
assignment by the managing partner.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.198
| don't believe it.
He told you.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.955
That's what you're
concerned about?

38:18.046 --> 38:19.582
You people!

38:20.340 --> 38:23.833
| come here and give you
a chance to clean up your act,

38:23.927 --> 38:25.292
and inside of two days,

38:25.386 --> 38:27.423
not only am | openly defied
left and right,

38:27.514 --> 38:30.256
but | find out the managing
partner wants me gone so badly,

38:30.350 --> 38:32.011
he ordered someone
to hack the New York Bar!

38:32.101 --> 38:33.808
Bullshit, | didn't order
Benjamin to do that!

38:33.895 --> 38:35.556
Are you saying
he's lying to me now?

38:35.647 --> 38:38.560
I'm saying | told him that |
didn't give a shit what it took.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.732
| wanted the bylaws.
| didn't mean for him to...

38:40.819 --> 38:42.025
To hack them?

38:42.111 --> 38:44.978
Well, that's what he took it to mean.
Because you gave him an order.

38:45.073 --> 38:46.734
Said you didn't care
how he accomplished it.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.657
And you know what?
As far as I'm concerned,

38:48.743 --> 38:50.859
you're lucky I'm not
letting you go right now.

38:50.954 --> 38:52.365
You can't talk
to me like that.

38:52.455 --> 38:54.162
That's the problem
with this place.

38:54.249 --> 38:56.240
You're a bunch of wild dogs
running around,

38:56.334 --> 38:59.167
defecating all over the legal
standards you swore to uphold.

38:59.254 --> 39:03.669
And you can bet your ass I'm
gonna put a leash on every one of you.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.801
Well?
It's done.

39:16.688 --> 39:17.849
We're off the hook.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.268
Then she bought it.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.816
It was the truth, Harvey.
There was nothing to buy.

39:23.778 --> 39:26.941
Hey, what do you say
we break out the can opener?

39:27.407 --> 39:28.397
Whoa.

39:28.491 --> 39:31.574
That is a pretrial thing, not a
we-just-got-out-of-trouble thing.

39:31.661 --> 39:32.947
Who says it can't be both?

39:33.037 --> 39:36.530
The can opener says it can't be both.
You can't argue with the can opener.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.661
Hey, I'm not the bad guy here.
You might not be the bad guy,

39:38.751 --> 39:40.333
but that doesn't mean that...
| hate to interrupt,

39:40.420 --> 39:43.629
but you need to get yourselves over
to IT, and you need to do it right now.

39:49.095 --> 39:50.460
What the fuck did you do?

39:50.555 --> 39:52.717
Louis, you don't understand.
She knew before | even told her.

39:52.807 --> 39:56.516
Bullshit. She knew because you told her.
You betrayed me. You betrayed this firm...

39:56.603 --> 39:58.014
| tried to hide it, | swear.

39:58.104 --> 39:59.845
Save your pathetic excuses,
and get the hell out of my firm.

39:59.939 --> 40:01.145
You are fired.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.018
Louis, stop!
LOUIS: Stay out of this.

40:03.109 --> 40:04.599
She's not staying out of it,
and neither am I.

40:04.694 --> 40:05.684
What the hell
is going on here?

40:05.778 --> 40:07.610
| asked this traitor
to help us get rid of Faye.

40:07.697 --> 40:09.313
Instead of doing it,
he ratted me out.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.694
Louis, what was | supposed to
do? She found out about the hack.

40:11.784 --> 40:12.774
What hack?

40:12.869 --> 40:14.826
He asked me to find
a loophole in the Bar's bylaws

40:14.913 --> 40:16.403
that he could use
to get Faye out.

40:16.497 --> 40:18.329
Louis, you had no right
to ask him that.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.623
Bullshit, | had every right!
I'm the managing partner.

40:20.710 --> 40:21.996
Just like | have
the right to fire him.

40:22.086 --> 40:26.000
No, you don't. There's three of us here.
I'm calling it to a vote. I'm against.

40:26.090 --> 40:29.003
You can't do that. He's support
staff. It's not subject to a vote.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.084
The hell itisn't!
Right, Harvey?

40:32.013 --> 40:33.503
Right. Louis...

40:33.598 --> 40:35.464
Okay, this is horseshit.
You're just agreeing with Donna

40:35.558 --> 40:37.174
because you don't want her
to be mad at you

40:37.268 --> 40:38.258
now that you're
in a relationship.

40:38.353 --> 40:39.434
Louis, that's ridiculous.

40:39.520 --> 40:42.012
Harvey would never side
with me just because of that.

40:43.483 --> 40:47.522
Yeah, | knew it. Which means
it's my call. Benjamin's gone.

40:47.612 --> 40:49.023
FAYE: No, he's not.

40:49.113 --> 40:51.696
Because this shows
an utter lack of judgment.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.114
And I'm not letting it stand.

40:53.201 --> 40:54.532
No, you're just going
to come in here

40:54.619 --> 40:56.951
and publicly humiliate me for
the third time in as many days.

40:57.038 --> 40:58.028
Well, forgive me

40:58.122 --> 41:00.204
if | don't feel like sticking
around for your party.

41:04.545 --> 41:05.535
KATRINA: Bowling?

41:05.922 --> 41:06.957
(CHUCKLES)

41:07.048 --> 41:08.630
He's already telling people?

41:08.716 --> 41:10.172
No, | went
by his office earlier

41:10.259 --> 41:13.627
to see how he's doing
with the whole Faye thing,

41:13.721 --> 41:15.177
and Gretchen told me
where you two were.

41:15.348 --> 41:17.589
Well, if you want to know
how it went,

41:17.684 --> 41:19.140
the man's actually a natural.

41:19.727 --> 41:20.717
I'm not surprised.

41:21.562 --> 41:24.520
You aren't? No, once
he puts his mind to things,

41:24.607 --> 41:26.848
Louis is an incredibly
quick study.

41:26.943 --> 41:29.230
You really do know him.
| do.

41:29.779 --> 41:30.940
Which is why | know

41:31.030 --> 41:33.988
he's going to need his friends
now more than ever.

41:34.075 --> 41:36.817
You were there for him today,
and | appreciate that.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.073
Well, I'll be there
for him tomorrow, too.

41:39.163 --> 41:40.494
We all will.

41:54.929 --> 41:56.135
What are you doing here?

41:56.222 --> 41:58.054
| heard what you said
about humiliating you,

41:58.141 --> 42:00.758
so I'm coming to you in
private to say what | have to say.

42:01.227 --> 42:02.217
What is it?

42:02.311 --> 42:03.801
Well, for starters,
Benjamin is staying

42:03.896 --> 42:07.230
because he doesn't deserve to be punished
for doing something you made him do.

42:07.316 --> 42:08.556
| told you, | didn't
make him do anything...

42:08.651 --> 42:09.641
And Wells Fargo

42:09.736 --> 42:12.819
didn't make its employees
open those fake accounts.

42:12.905 --> 42:15.613
But pressure from the top
is hard to withstand.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.691
Well, then why don't you have
that engraved on a paperweight?

42:17.785 --> 42:20.743
Because you may be special
master, but I'm managing partner.

42:20.872 --> 42:23.910
That gives me certain
rights... Not anymore.

42:24.000 --> 42:24.990
What?

42:25.084 --> 42:27.075
Because | went after your bylaws,
you think you can go after mine?

42:27.170 --> 42:29.286
Good luck. They're airtight.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.418
| meant you're not
managing partner anymore.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.258
Effective immediately.

42:35.344 --> 42:38.302
You're stripped of your title
and all the duties that go with it.

42:38.389 --> 42:41.302
You can either accept
this or resign.
