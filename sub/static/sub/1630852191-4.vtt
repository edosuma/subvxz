WEBVTT

01:26.127 --> 01:28.755
<i>Each day felt special and warm</i>

01:29.255 --> 01:31.049
<i>that winter.</i>

01:32.717 --> 01:36.054
<i>And at the end of it, Woo-jae disappeared.</i>

01:56.658 --> 01:59.285
<i>What about me made him choose to leave?</i>

02:01.287 --> 02:03.289
<i>What did I do wrong?</i>

02:53.256 --> 02:55.675
<i>Why did I think</i>

02:56.509 --> 02:59.554
<i>I was to blame all those years?</i>

03:07.896 --> 03:08.938
I'm sorry.

03:22.493 --> 03:25.622
FIRST SOLO EXHIBITION BY JEONG HUI-JU

03:37.759 --> 03:40.553
EPISODE 4
WHAT SHOULDN'T BE LOVED

03:40.637 --> 03:42.347
<i>Woo-jae</i>

03:43.264 --> 03:45.433
<i>really misses you.</i>

04:03.618 --> 04:05.078
I thought you two

04:06.246 --> 04:08.122
had broken up.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.251
You're right.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.171
I should've broken up when you told me to.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.426
I think I turned out this way

04:20.510 --> 04:22.470
because of him.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.473
He totally ruined me.

04:26.474 --> 04:27.558
What are you--

04:27.642 --> 04:30.144
Had I known the reason why he left me…

04:30.645 --> 04:33.815
Had I known where and what he was doing,

04:33.898 --> 04:36.234
I wouldn't have been in this much pain.

04:37.527 --> 04:40.029
I told myself I'd never forgive him.

04:41.239 --> 04:45.285
I made a promise to myself
God knows how many times.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.540
But having resenting him
for all those years…

04:50.623 --> 04:51.958
It's been unbearable.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.257
Forgiving him seems easier.

05:01.926 --> 05:03.511
So I'm going to forgive him.

05:11.602 --> 05:12.812
Because Woo-jae

05:13.396 --> 05:14.897
came back.

05:22.071 --> 05:25.074
Whenever I think of the good times
I've had with Woo-jae,

05:25.158 --> 05:27.285
you were always there too.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.996
We should all get together soon.

05:31.622 --> 05:34.459
-Actually, he's--
-No.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.337
I don't understand.

05:39.589 --> 05:42.008
Even married couples get over each other

05:42.508 --> 05:44.218
once they divorce.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.847
You only dated him briefly years ago,

05:48.806 --> 05:51.309
and he dumped you coldheartedly at that.

05:51.392 --> 05:54.270
But you haven't gotten over him
resenting him all these years?

05:54.353 --> 05:56.064
I don't know how to feel about that.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.192
I had my reasons.

06:00.026 --> 06:03.905
Right. You were always quick to justify.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.407
-I--
-If you're trying

06:06.491 --> 06:08.034
to justify assaulting Li-sa

06:08.117 --> 06:11.454
by giving excuses
about your personal misfortunes,

06:11.537 --> 06:12.455
it's no use.

06:13.915 --> 06:17.627
Whatever your reasons are, it doesn't
change the fact that you hurt her.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.797
Let's not meet ever again.

06:42.443 --> 06:43.903
<i>Am I the only fool here?</i>

06:44.529 --> 06:46.906
If you want to leave, leave on your own.
You can't take Ho-su.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.389
She should've

07:12.306 --> 07:13.808
heard me out.

07:51.012 --> 07:51.846
Hey.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.223
Hi.

08:01.939 --> 08:02.940
Hey.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.651
Why were you sleeping there?

08:05.735 --> 08:09.155
He wouldn't go to bed.
It wasn't easy tucking him in.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.825
Goodness.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.295
What did you do today?

08:26.881 --> 08:28.966
I was preparing for the exhibition.

08:39.310 --> 08:41.229
It must be tiring working until late.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.923
LEE JU-YEONG

10:33.007 --> 10:35.009
<i>Ms. Gu, here's the video.</i>

10:42.767 --> 10:44.226
<i>Doesn't it look real?</i>

10:44.810 --> 10:47.146
<i>Well, we're not making anything
from scratch.</i>

10:48.773 --> 10:50.316
<i>What do I need to do next?</i>

10:53.402 --> 10:57.615
Isn't it a bit too much
to have a bottle by yourself?

10:57.698 --> 10:59.575
I'm expecting someone.

11:00.534 --> 11:01.661
Another glass, please.

11:40.324 --> 11:43.327
<i>Because Woo-jae came back.</i>

11:43.411 --> 11:46.789
<i>Woo-jae really misses you.</i>

11:48.541 --> 11:49.959
Bullshit.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.828
Li-sa, let's go.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.149
Do you know what this is?

13:37.900 --> 13:40.152
-What?
-This flower.

13:43.989 --> 13:44.949
That's a flower?

13:45.032 --> 13:48.118
What? You don't know either?

13:50.079 --> 13:51.539
When we were living there…

13:52.122 --> 13:52.998
Where?

13:54.208 --> 13:55.376
That place.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.962
You were there too.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.594
You were. I'm sure of it.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.140
What was this flower called again?

14:11.141 --> 14:12.017
<i>Heath.</i>

14:16.981 --> 14:18.732
<i>These wildflowers</i>

14:18.816 --> 14:21.610
<i>bloom once a year in the wilderness.</i>

14:23.487 --> 14:24.655
<i>Isn't it amazing?</i>

14:33.873 --> 14:35.708
Mom, isn't this pretty?

14:35.791 --> 14:37.710
Li-sa, stay here.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.149
Pull over.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.860
I'll drive you to the school gate.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.447
I don't want others to see us together.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.498
By the way, where were you yesterday?

15:17.124 --> 15:19.043
-What?
-Last night.

15:19.126 --> 15:22.129
Mom was in her studio. Where were you?

15:23.631 --> 15:24.798
Well…

15:38.687 --> 15:39.939
<i>You're late.</i>

15:41.023 --> 15:43.442
No, I'm good. I drove here.

15:44.568 --> 15:47.363
What a shame.
You're paying for this bottle.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.114
I didn't know you were married.

15:51.158 --> 15:55.079
You were born on April 10, 1990,
and are married to Seo Woo-jae.

15:57.748 --> 15:58.707
Am I right?

15:58.791 --> 16:00.417
Is that a problem?

16:01.502 --> 16:02.670
Hold on.

16:03.504 --> 16:06.799
Why are you even interested
in my personal life?

16:07.716 --> 16:09.551
I'm not interested in you.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.763
But I am interested

16:13.806 --> 16:14.932
in your husband.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.105
Where have you

16:21.689 --> 16:22.731
hidden him?

16:23.983 --> 16:25.359
Hidden?

16:26.568 --> 16:28.278
That's rich coming from you.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.118
Does she know

16:34.618 --> 16:36.495
what kind of person her husband is?

16:39.248 --> 16:40.624
Probably not.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.294
She'd have left if she did.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.509
How have you endured it
knowing everything?

16:51.885 --> 16:54.555
You've decided to sweep
everything under the rug

16:55.180 --> 16:59.810
and believe you can still keep
living as a good husband and father.

16:59.893 --> 17:02.813
Is that arrogance

17:03.397 --> 17:04.606
or just a delusion?

17:06.442 --> 17:08.819
If you don't stop, I swear…

17:09.737 --> 17:11.196
I'm done.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.407
Why bother arguing
when we're both miserable?

17:15.826 --> 17:19.038
You don't know me enough
to peg me as a miserable person.

17:19.621 --> 17:20.831
Maybe you're not.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.044
Where is Woo-jae?

17:25.627 --> 17:27.379
What'll you do with him if I tell you?

17:28.672 --> 17:30.299
Does Hui-ju know?

17:30.382 --> 17:32.217
I'm not sure if it's a good thing,

17:33.093 --> 17:35.429
but she refused to hear me out.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.518
Why don't you just drink?
I think we'll be here for a while.

17:53.614 --> 17:54.615
PUBLISHING CONTRACT

17:56.241 --> 17:59.912
We haven't published
a fourth-edition essay in a long time.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.666
Are you working on your next one?

18:06.460 --> 18:08.045
You should.

18:08.754 --> 18:12.591
I thought of what our readers
would want to read about,

18:12.674 --> 18:14.176
and I'm stuck.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.972
Of course, they want
to hear about your story.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.516
Really?

18:20.599 --> 18:23.519
I doubt they want to hear
about how I went from rags to riches

18:23.602 --> 18:24.812
by marrying a wealthy man.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.777
I'm aware of it.
I know people gossip about me.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.862
And I won't deny it.

18:35.072 --> 18:37.032
You've made it this far
because you're good.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.327
You have so many fans
who love your paintings.

18:41.328 --> 18:44.748
And I have my husband
to thank for that, at least partially.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.794
I was able to solely focus on my work

18:48.877 --> 18:51.547
unlike others who struggled
to make ends meet.

18:51.630 --> 18:56.677
So I doubt any advice or comforting words
from me will mean anything to them.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.348
It'd be nice to share
those honest thoughts.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.393
I should just write them in my journal.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.603
Then did you ever have a painful--

19:06.687 --> 19:10.357
No, I don't like bringing up the past.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.901
I like where I am now.

20:05.412 --> 20:08.832
We'll hire eight new teachers
for the major courses within this year.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.919
The Office of Education approved it.

20:12.002 --> 20:15.839
Three are internally-selected,
and we'll hire the rest this month.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.634
What about the general course teachers?

20:18.717 --> 20:21.929
We can't dismiss them
due to the teachers' rights.

20:22.012 --> 20:25.057
We're considering transferring them

20:25.140 --> 20:28.560
to schools under our foundation
or sending them to other schools.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.688
In a year or two,
we'll need more teachers.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.149
So let's have them come back after a year.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.150
Yes, sir.

20:36.109 --> 20:38.070
Form a school personnel committee.

20:38.153 --> 20:41.281
And make sure they all sign
the Declaration of Ethical Conduct Form.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.743
I believe Mr. Lee Hyeong-gi
from Taerim Foundation will--

20:44.826 --> 20:48.622
The medical foundation
has nothing to do with our school.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.958
-Please take care of it yourself.
-Yes, sir.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.835
And leave out anyone
who was selected through connections.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.296
But sir, the foundation has already--

20:56.380 --> 20:59.549
The internally-selected teachers
could become a problem.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.928
Please relay this message to Mr. Lee.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.179
But…

21:04.763 --> 21:05.973
You may leave.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.517
Have the residents been signing

21:10.060 --> 21:11.436
the consent forms?

21:13.230 --> 21:14.189
Yes, sir.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.734
This region is commercially depressed.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.653
So they're open to moving

21:19.736 --> 21:22.572
or switching their line of work
if the compensation is enough.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.993
But some are still against it.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.257
How about some coffee?

21:40.340 --> 21:42.676
I look forward to learning a lot from you.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.304
How do you have
such decisiveness and good judgment?

21:45.887 --> 21:47.306
They come from experience.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.392
-Right.
-In other words, you're talented.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.644
Not at all.
I've worked hard to get this far.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.313
Hello.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.023
Let me.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.232
I'll wrap it up then.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.694
-Let's go.
-Okay.

22:00.777 --> 22:02.404
-Drink on your way.
-Okay.

22:17.544 --> 22:21.548
Hey, I thought we were going
somewhere nice, not here.

22:21.631 --> 22:24.760
This hospital's coffee tastes the best.
I wonder why.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.345
You're right.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.848
Gossiping and coffee
go well with each other.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.185
Seeing even the wealthy die eventually
makes you

22:33.268 --> 22:35.729
feel a bit better
about cleaning up after them.

22:35.812 --> 22:37.105
You're right.

22:38.857 --> 22:41.526
Seeing others suffer is so entertaining.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.779
I only stick around

22:43.862 --> 22:47.115
because it's so entertaining
to see you grovel in front of Ms. Park.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.826
-Has she changed at all?
-What do you think?

22:50.410 --> 22:51.453
How terrifying.

22:52.329 --> 22:53.997
Hang in there.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.916
She'll end up in there soon.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.634
I heard their beef pâté is scrumptious,

23:05.717 --> 23:07.719
but they're always fully booked.

23:08.678 --> 23:11.139
You're the best.

23:11.223 --> 23:14.810
And here's what you asked for.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.689
He'll be back in Seoul tomorrow.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.984
I told him I'd give you his number,
so send him a text first.

23:23.902 --> 23:27.155
We must've had good connections
when he was a cop,

23:27.239 --> 23:29.741
seeing how he always gets the job done.

23:29.825 --> 23:30.951
Thanks.

23:32.327 --> 23:33.870
I should thank you.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.665
While I was at it,

23:36.748 --> 23:38.917
I convinced him to come fishing again.

23:40.669 --> 23:43.421
Why did you even break up?
You guys were doing great.

23:43.505 --> 23:47.259
It's simple. We didn't love each other
enough to endure everything.

23:54.683 --> 23:57.018
Are you seriously going
to leave like this?

23:57.102 --> 23:59.729
I haven't been out in ages,
so I have many errands to run.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.274
-Did you call a cab?
-I did.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.443
How's Ho-su? Is he more attached to you?

24:06.903 --> 24:08.071
Not at all.

24:09.906 --> 24:11.741
He's different from kids his age.

24:11.825 --> 24:14.786
He loves his grandma more than me.

24:16.204 --> 24:19.749
At times, I'm afraid
that he'll choose her over me.

24:19.833 --> 24:22.794
Other times, I wonder if I truly love him.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.756
And that thought scares me
more than anything.

24:27.549 --> 24:28.925
Of course you love him.

24:30.760 --> 24:34.055
The fact that you crave his love
and are afraid of losing him

24:34.556 --> 24:36.141
proves that you love him.

24:39.394 --> 24:41.521
Don't doubt yourself. Okay?

24:44.316 --> 24:45.192
My cab's here.

24:45.275 --> 24:46.818
-Bye.
-Bye.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.574
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.993
She looks like one of my customers.

24:55.076 --> 24:56.077
Your customer?

24:56.828 --> 24:58.205
Is it one of your regulars?

24:58.705 --> 25:00.957
No, she just left a strong impression.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.918
-Bye.
-Bye.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.878
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

25:12.052 --> 25:13.136
Right.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.098
Rheumatism?

25:17.182 --> 25:20.977
Apparently, my immune system
fails to recognize my own body

25:22.062 --> 25:23.772
and ends up attacking it.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.608
It's a chronic disease,
so you must take good care of it.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.193
It must've been painful.

25:28.276 --> 25:30.445
At times, pain isn't that bad.

25:31.488 --> 25:34.199
When you suddenly wake up
in the middle of the night…

25:35.492 --> 25:36.868
Have you ever felt that way?

25:38.161 --> 25:41.414
Your limbs feel so stiff
that you can't even move.

25:41.498 --> 25:46.002
You're not aware of your surroundings
and wonder if you're dead.

25:46.586 --> 25:48.672
That's a symptom of rheumatism.

25:50.966 --> 25:54.344
Suddenly, you feel a sharp pain

25:54.427 --> 25:57.472
and realize
that you're not dead after all.

25:58.515 --> 26:00.141
Then you can breathe again.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.687
You feel this pleasure--

26:03.770 --> 26:05.855
It's foolish to enjoy the pain.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.693
Put your arm down.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.404
You're right.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.948
I am a fool.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.867
I won't deny that.

26:18.451 --> 26:21.329
But I'm not evil enough
to enjoy seeing others suffer.

26:24.457 --> 26:26.584
I'm regretting what I did…

26:28.295 --> 26:29.754
to Li-sa.

26:33.508 --> 26:37.429
Can you help me meet with her again?

26:42.392 --> 26:44.352
I haven't been able to see her

26:45.270 --> 26:49.107
since that incident
because her parents wouldn't let me.

26:53.194 --> 26:54.738
I have no ulterior motive.

26:54.821 --> 26:58.658
You told me
I should apologize to her sincerely.

27:01.202 --> 27:04.706
Yes, you should. Before it's too late.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.460
I will.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.463
So that

27:11.546 --> 27:14.424
she knows how to apologize
when she does something wrong.

27:21.222 --> 27:23.224
NEUROSURGERY DR. AN MIN-SEO

27:24.517 --> 27:27.771
My afternoon shift has started.
If it's not urgent…

27:30.440 --> 27:31.983
Were you aware of it?

27:33.318 --> 27:37.072
The children of the hospital directors
who favor you…

27:38.990 --> 27:42.911
Did you know I jumped through hoops
to get them into the art school?

27:43.661 --> 27:45.163
But it all went down the drain.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.793
I oversee all the legal teams
in our foundation.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.129
But your brother considered
his school separate.

27:55.548 --> 28:00.303
You know I'm not well-versed in that area.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.139
Exactly.

28:03.223 --> 28:06.643
Your stupidity is
what makes me look like a fool.

28:07.227 --> 28:08.353
Are you a doormat?

28:08.436 --> 28:13.733
Are you going to waste your life slaving
away for that money-grubbing family?

28:15.485 --> 28:18.488
That's my family you're talking about.

28:18.571 --> 28:20.365
-How could you say--
-Exactly.

28:30.333 --> 28:33.169
Why aren't you sly like them?

28:33.670 --> 28:35.672
You take after your father

28:36.297 --> 28:38.299
and only know how to treat patients.

28:39.467 --> 28:40.301
Right?

28:41.219 --> 28:42.220
Right?

28:42.720 --> 28:45.348
Doctor An, your patients
are waiting for you.

28:54.357 --> 28:58.278
I'm the one you'll spend
your remaining life with, not them.

28:58.361 --> 28:59.487
Got that?

29:04.033 --> 29:06.703
Don't be content with your position here.

29:08.204 --> 29:10.373
Climb up the ladder.

29:43.656 --> 29:45.450
Come in.

29:45.533 --> 29:46.659
Hello.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.455
Let's see.

29:50.955 --> 29:53.416
You've gotten much better.

30:14.395 --> 30:15.647
Thank you.

30:17.857 --> 30:20.902
Thanks to your help,
I avoided disciplinary actions.

30:22.737 --> 30:26.616
The more generous Taerim is,
the better the image and value it'll have.

30:32.747 --> 30:34.582
LAWYER LEE HYEONG-GI

30:38.711 --> 30:40.088
MS. GU HAE-WON
HAS SENT A VIDEO

30:40.755 --> 30:42.632
I'll be glad to help again.

30:42.715 --> 30:44.676
I trust that you'll get me rehired.

30:48.012 --> 30:50.849
Turn the handle smoothly

30:50.932 --> 30:52.267
so you won't spill anything.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.810
This is much easier.

30:53.893 --> 30:54.769
-Right?
-Yes.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.858
Wash the portafilter well,
or it'll look like your face.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.526
Come on.

31:01.609 --> 31:02.735
We have a customer.

31:05.613 --> 31:07.699
I can take a break in five minutes.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.617
One cup of coffee, please.

31:15.290 --> 31:18.126
I've never gotten
a brand-new phone before.

31:18.209 --> 31:20.879
I've always used
secondhand or thrown-out ones.

31:21.963 --> 31:23.423
Your dad never bought you one?

31:26.009 --> 31:28.094
What does he do for a living?

31:28.177 --> 31:29.387
I don't know.

31:29.470 --> 31:30.555
You don't know?

31:31.055 --> 31:32.807
Aren't all dads like that?

31:33.391 --> 31:36.519
You never know what they're up to,
and they always drink at home.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.897
I don't have a mom, so don't ask.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.357
RESTORING DATA

31:44.527 --> 31:45.695
Excuse me.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.657
-It's on me.
-Thank you.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.828
Does he know as well?

31:53.912 --> 31:55.955
-Know what?
-That you don't have a mom.

31:58.374 --> 32:01.753
Don't open up to everyone
just because they're friendly to you.

32:03.087 --> 32:05.381
-What?
-About how you don't have a mom

32:06.174 --> 32:09.260
or any money.
Or about your dad drinking every day

32:09.344 --> 32:11.804
and how that makes you feel lonely.
Things like that.

32:12.889 --> 32:13.848
Why not?

32:16.601 --> 32:18.019
Because you'll look vulnerable.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.898
They can pretend to worry about you
and easily win you over.

32:21.981 --> 32:24.567
What's wrong with that?
They're concerned about me.

32:24.651 --> 32:26.486
Because it's terrifying

32:26.569 --> 32:28.404
when those people change.

32:29.447 --> 32:31.532
It's better to be safe than sorry.

32:31.616 --> 32:34.077
How would you know?

32:34.160 --> 32:36.079
You have a husband and are well-off.

32:37.872 --> 32:40.416
Because there was a time

32:40.500 --> 32:44.337
when I had no husband or money
and only a mom who'd drink every day.

33:13.741 --> 33:15.493
I'll clean it up.

33:15.576 --> 33:17.412
Thank you for the phone.

33:17.495 --> 33:18.997
What about this phone?

33:21.332 --> 33:22.500
You can keep it.

33:23.626 --> 33:24.836
Check it when you're bored.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.639
LI-SA'S TUTOR

33:37.640 --> 33:39.058
Hello, ma'am.

33:40.518 --> 33:43.521
<i>Li-sa isn't home yet,
so we should postpone today's class.</i>

33:44.522 --> 33:47.859
<i>It rings, but she's not picking up.
I think she's doing it on purpose.</i>

34:45.792 --> 34:47.043
Where is she?

34:48.169 --> 34:49.170
Who?

34:49.712 --> 34:52.632
Your art teacher.
She was just here with you.

34:52.715 --> 34:53.883
Where did she go?

34:57.595 --> 34:59.472
Where the hell is she?

35:02.141 --> 35:05.019
You skipped your tutoring class
and didn't answer your phone.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.522
-What were you doing with--
-What about you?

35:08.481 --> 35:10.650
Why did you meet with Ju-yeong
behind my back?

35:14.195 --> 35:16.531
-At the cafe this afternoon--
-I told you

35:16.614 --> 35:18.157
that she's a leech.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.201
-It was because you--
-I told you

35:20.284 --> 35:23.162
she sponges off others
to get what she needs!

35:23.246 --> 35:24.789
So why won't you listen to me?

35:26.457 --> 35:27.458
Li-sa.

35:28.459 --> 35:29.961
An Li-sa!

35:31.879 --> 35:33.422
Why won't you answer me?

35:33.506 --> 35:35.299
What were you doing with--

35:35.383 --> 35:37.135
She apologized.

35:37.218 --> 35:39.887
That's it? Did she say anything else?

35:39.971 --> 35:41.347
What else--

35:41.430 --> 35:44.392
What else does she need to say
other than that she's sorry?

35:45.101 --> 35:48.646
Then why would she come
all the way here to see you alone?

35:48.729 --> 35:51.482
Because she wanted
to apologize for what she'd done.

35:55.653 --> 35:56.863
What?

35:58.197 --> 36:00.950
Do you think she hit me
because I did something wrong?

36:01.033 --> 36:02.493
Do you believe that lunatic?

36:15.798 --> 36:21.596
<i>GAMJATANG</i>

36:35.401 --> 36:38.112
I'd like what she's having.
No side dishes, please.

36:40.406 --> 36:42.325
There are no empty tables.

36:45.661 --> 36:48.915
But others will think
that we're eating together.

36:49.749 --> 36:50.791
Is that bad?

36:51.417 --> 36:52.710
I don't mind.

36:53.461 --> 36:56.255
But I don't want that woman
from before to get the wrong idea.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.799
No, she won't be coming here today.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.385
An older girlfriend?

37:03.596 --> 37:05.348
I don't think she's your mom.

37:05.431 --> 37:07.391
Neither.

37:07.475 --> 37:09.560
-Then who is she?
-What about you?

37:10.353 --> 37:11.562
Do you have a boyfriend?

37:13.189 --> 37:14.065
No.

37:16.734 --> 37:18.277
I have a husband.

37:26.494 --> 37:28.454
BUS STOP

37:39.048 --> 37:40.132
Are you going home?

37:42.510 --> 37:43.761
Your bus.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.683
It broke down
at the three-way intersection.

37:50.768 --> 37:51.978
I see.

37:52.061 --> 37:53.562
It'll take some time.

37:54.522 --> 37:57.066
Hop in. We're going in the same direction.

38:22.967 --> 38:26.470
I'll let you know that I don't usually hop

38:26.554 --> 38:28.180
into a stranger's car.

38:28.264 --> 38:30.516
But today, I'm a bit exhausted.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.063
But I'm not a stranger.

38:38.649 --> 38:39.775
That's true.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.571
That's why you should be more cautious.

38:45.948 --> 38:47.825
Those around you can be

38:48.492 --> 38:50.077
even more dangerous.

38:56.667 --> 38:59.378
I have some stuff to drop off at the bar.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.173
Can I drop you off here?

39:02.256 --> 39:03.507
Sure.

39:10.389 --> 39:11.932
Oh, right. Look.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.852
Don't tell her that you saw me today.

39:15.603 --> 39:18.147
-What?
-My daughter, Hae-won.

39:18.230 --> 39:19.190
Don't tell her.

39:20.941 --> 39:21.776
Okay.

39:22.943 --> 39:23.986
And

39:24.904 --> 39:26.072
thank you.

39:47.301 --> 39:50.012
How long have you been waiting? Hold on.

39:52.598 --> 39:54.934
RICE MEAL

39:55.017 --> 39:56.185
Give me one minute.

40:08.531 --> 40:10.032
Don't like my mom.

40:12.034 --> 40:13.202
I don't.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.121
Then why give her a ride?

40:16.122 --> 40:18.624
Oh, that? You see,

40:19.875 --> 40:23.254
the bus broke down
at the three-way intersection.

40:23.337 --> 40:25.047
She likes handsome men.

40:26.882 --> 40:30.094
They can be scumbags
as long as they're good-looking.

40:30.970 --> 40:32.346
But you're…

40:36.434 --> 40:37.560
Okay.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.020
I'll ignore her from now on.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.648
You seem like a decent guy. That's why.

40:43.232 --> 40:45.693
My mom has gone through some stuff.

40:46.652 --> 40:49.572
People like her
tend to torment those around them.

40:49.655 --> 40:50.781
That's a relief.

40:52.158 --> 40:54.785
There are many
who torment others for no apparent reason.

40:56.412 --> 40:59.415
You wouldn't know why
no matter how many times you wondered

41:00.124 --> 41:01.333
why they're doing it.

41:03.419 --> 41:05.629
Anyway, I warned you.

41:07.423 --> 41:08.924
What? Where are you going?

41:10.259 --> 41:11.719
Didn't you come here to drink?

41:26.025 --> 41:27.443
But I'm not a decent guy.

42:00.142 --> 42:03.187
I believe you. I'm sorry.

42:06.357 --> 42:09.777
If that teacher approaches you again,

42:09.860 --> 42:11.362
then tell me--

42:11.445 --> 42:13.489
I'm going to rinse off now. Get out.

42:18.827 --> 42:22.665
I just did that out of worry

42:23.332 --> 42:25.125
that she'd hurt you again.

42:28.128 --> 42:30.839
I'm sorry for not telling you
that I was meeting--

42:30.923 --> 42:32.049
Get out.

42:38.973 --> 42:45.980
Li-sa, no one can steal me from you.
You do know that, right?

46:27.743 --> 46:29.328
<i>I had no other intentions.</i>

46:31.747 --> 46:33.081
<i>I just wanted</i>

46:33.916 --> 46:35.709
<i>to buy some time.</i>

46:51.600 --> 46:54.686
Born on October 24, 1985.

46:54.770 --> 46:57.439
The resident registration number
is 152831.

46:58.106 --> 47:01.360
His name is Seo Woo-jae.

47:02.861 --> 47:04.821
Correct. Woo-jae.

47:06.323 --> 47:07.783
One more person, please.

47:10.494 --> 47:13.455
Gu Hae-won, born on April 10.

47:15.624 --> 47:16.583
Correct.

47:18.544 --> 47:20.045
Thank you.

47:26.677 --> 47:27.761
Hello.

47:30.389 --> 47:31.515
Where's Min-seo?

47:31.598 --> 47:33.600
She had surgery scheduled this morning.

47:33.684 --> 47:37.563
She should look after her body
before tending to her patients.

47:40.023 --> 47:40.857
Ho-su.

47:43.402 --> 47:45.821
Ho-su, you shouldn't draw on this.

47:45.904 --> 47:47.656
-Give that back.
-You have your book.

47:47.739 --> 47:49.241
-Read this.
-Hey.

47:49.908 --> 47:52.786
Don't worry about my grandson,
and take care of your family.

47:52.869 --> 47:55.622
Your mom called and thanked me.

47:55.706 --> 47:58.041
Must I continue putting up with this?

48:00.252 --> 48:02.296
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

48:03.046 --> 48:05.757
Of course you didn't know. Again.

48:05.841 --> 48:07.968
So Hyeon-seong did it by himself?

48:09.219 --> 48:13.056
Her business fails every single time,
and yet, he keeps giving her money.

48:13.140 --> 48:15.058
That's an illness.

48:15.142 --> 48:19.563
She shamelessly asks for money
and whines about how hard she works.

48:19.646 --> 48:23.525
Tell her to just stay home.
I'm sure you give her an allowance.

48:25.319 --> 48:27.779
-Mother.
-Am I wrong?

48:28.280 --> 48:29.448
You should stop too.

48:30.032 --> 48:32.284
You've done more than enough
for your poor mother.

48:32.367 --> 48:35.370
Most people exchange loyalty
for money, but she…

48:37.122 --> 48:40.959
Goodness, my puppy. Come here.

48:43.587 --> 48:45.339
Goodness.

48:54.181 --> 48:55.641
Let's see.

48:57.976 --> 49:00.520
I'm sure she didn't say that out of spite.

49:00.604 --> 49:03.065
I'd rather she did, to be honest.

49:03.148 --> 49:04.107
Sorry?

49:04.733 --> 49:08.362
It's more appalling
if she's saying such awful things

49:08.445 --> 49:10.155
with no spite.

49:20.123 --> 49:22.167
Don't mind me. I just forgot something.

49:22.250 --> 49:23.919
You should've called.

49:24.002 --> 49:26.129
-It's my phone that I forgot.
-I see.

50:27.149 --> 50:28.525
<i>It must look realistic.</i>

50:29.109 --> 50:30.527
That's what's most important.

50:39.494 --> 50:44.624
BILLIARD HALL

50:44.708 --> 50:47.127
PROTECT OUR PROPERTY RIGHTS

51:02.392 --> 51:03.685
What is it?

51:06.938 --> 51:09.191
I was wondering if you were still open.

51:10.776 --> 51:12.402
I heard this place is getting sold.

51:12.486 --> 51:15.030
Who the hell said that? You should leave.

51:21.244 --> 51:24.456
Are you Lee Ju-yeong's father?

51:25.290 --> 51:27.000
What the hell are you talking about?

51:35.926 --> 51:36.968
BILLIARD HALL

51:47.103 --> 51:48.188
Ms. Gu.

51:57.280 --> 52:01.243
So you're telling me
that if I hold out and don't sign this,

52:01.326 --> 52:02.994
the school plan may fall through?

52:04.663 --> 52:06.915
This entire building will be cleaned up.

52:07.499 --> 52:09.584
It's not part of the school region,

52:09.668 --> 52:13.463
but if any of the stores aren't
student-friendly, it won't happen.

52:14.089 --> 52:17.259
For example, this billiard hall?

52:17.342 --> 52:18.260
Correct.

52:18.343 --> 52:21.054
I wouldn't be able
to move out even if I wanted to.

52:21.137 --> 52:25.183
I put this house up as collateral
for this place.

52:25.767 --> 52:28.103
How could I possibly leave
without a premium?

52:28.186 --> 52:29.980
That's why you should get compensation.

52:30.647 --> 52:34.901
However, you may end up with nothing
if you get too greedy and it's canceled.

52:36.111 --> 52:40.156
So you must listen to me
and sign it after a negotiation.

52:40.240 --> 52:42.367
I trust you.

52:42.450 --> 52:44.452
If I get compensated,

52:45.036 --> 52:46.329
I'll treat you--

52:46.413 --> 52:50.000
You should treat Ju-yeong, not me.

52:52.586 --> 52:54.629
Right. Ju-yeong.

52:54.713 --> 52:55.881
Art school will be pricey

52:55.964 --> 52:58.174
even if she receives government benefits.

53:00.510 --> 53:01.720
That's fine

53:02.804 --> 53:05.140
as long as you're her teacher.

53:05.223 --> 53:06.975
That's my wish as well.

53:09.769 --> 53:12.022
So you should listen to me carefully

53:12.731 --> 53:14.816
and never be rash.

53:15.400 --> 53:18.528
Be patient and look at the big picture.

53:21.239 --> 53:23.992
Okay. I'll do that.

53:26.661 --> 53:27.913
Goodbye.

53:53.897 --> 53:56.232
Did we have to meet here of all places?

53:56.816 --> 53:59.069
I felt like we should.

54:03.698 --> 54:07.327
Six months ago, they moved into a place.

54:07.410 --> 54:09.871
But I don't know
if they're actually living there.

54:09.955 --> 54:12.832
It's not that far,
so you can go check yourself if you want.

54:14.542 --> 54:15.377
Okay.

54:16.419 --> 54:18.797
Is Dong-mi doing well?

54:22.092 --> 54:22.926
Yes.

54:37.524 --> 54:40.527
HOUSEHOLD REGISTER
SELF: SEO WOO-JAE, WIFE: GU HAE-WON

54:40.610 --> 54:46.324
CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE
SEO WOO-JAE, GU HAE-WON

54:49.786 --> 54:50.912
Marriage?

54:52.163 --> 54:55.667
We're not having a wedding.
We're just registering our marriage.

54:57.502 --> 54:58.962
They mean the same thing.

55:01.423 --> 55:05.093
There are many ways
for you two to study abroad together.

55:05.176 --> 55:07.429
You're too young to get married.

55:07.512 --> 55:10.265
I found out that there are
many benefits for married couples.

55:10.348 --> 55:11.808
What benefit do you need

55:11.891 --> 55:14.477
when you passed the language exam
and got admitted?

55:16.521 --> 55:20.191
What did he do while you were studying
German and preparing your portfolio?

55:23.361 --> 55:24.904
Does he even want to go?

55:25.655 --> 55:28.908
If you do go, he'll have to study
for the entrance exam,

55:28.992 --> 55:32.287
and you'll have to do
part-time jobs to make ends meet.

55:32.871 --> 55:33.913
Hui-ju.

55:33.997 --> 55:37.208
You'll have to provide
for someone else while studying abroad.

55:37.292 --> 55:38.293
How will you--

55:38.376 --> 55:40.336
You know I have good stamina.

55:40.420 --> 55:42.213
Marriage isn't a dream.

55:42.797 --> 55:46.092
It's your only chance
to dramatically turn your life around.

55:46.760 --> 55:50.805
Just because it worked for you
doesn't mean it'll work for me.

55:55.810 --> 55:57.145
I know how you feel.

55:59.064 --> 56:01.066
But you really don't need to worry.

56:01.149 --> 56:03.735
I'm going to be happy.

56:38.937 --> 56:40.313
Are you here to see the house?

56:40.396 --> 56:42.899
Someone else came by a few days ago.

56:43.650 --> 56:45.026
It's a good apartment.

56:45.110 --> 56:46.402
I see.

57:37.370 --> 57:38.705
<i>Let's begin the shoot.</i>

57:38.788 --> 57:41.291
Look at the camera. One, two.

57:42.667 --> 57:43.918
Good work.

57:44.419 --> 57:45.837
Can I talk to the bride?

58:08.735 --> 58:10.445
I'll take some shots of the bride.

58:11.029 --> 58:12.697
Okay. Here we go.

58:12.780 --> 58:14.616
Okay. One, two.

58:17.660 --> 58:19.120
One, two.

58:19.787 --> 58:21.164
Good.

58:23.082 --> 58:25.084
Put your shoulder a bit forward. Good.

58:25.168 --> 58:27.378
Here we go. One, two.

58:28.463 --> 58:29.380
Move.

58:31.508 --> 58:32.842
Is this what you wanted?

58:35.637 --> 58:36.679
Look at me.

58:39.349 --> 58:41.392
Do you want me to get married like you?

58:42.560 --> 58:44.103
So that we can all be miserable?

58:49.776 --> 58:53.780
Seeing how you came this far,
you don't want to end it with her either.

58:54.364 --> 58:57.367
You're wrong.
I only came because you asked me to.

58:57.450 --> 58:59.160
If you don't want me to, I won't.

59:10.672 --> 59:12.173
Just say the word.

59:15.885 --> 59:17.762
Tell me to stop.

59:27.063 --> 59:29.899
Here we go. One, two.

59:31.150 --> 59:33.736
-Okay. You're done.
-Thank you.

1:00:21.743 --> 1:00:22.994
Are you done?

1:00:23.077 --> 1:00:24.954
It was so awkward.

1:00:25.580 --> 1:00:28.666
I didn't know smiling
was so difficult. My face feels stiff.

1:00:29.542 --> 1:00:32.962
You should at least have
some photos, right? You did well.

1:00:33.046 --> 1:00:35.214
I don't think I can do this twice.

1:00:44.182 --> 1:00:45.850
You look so gorgeous.

1:00:45.933 --> 1:00:48.353
You're literally shining.

1:00:49.562 --> 1:00:51.272
Thank you so much.

1:00:52.065 --> 1:00:53.274
Don't mention it.

1:00:58.488 --> 1:00:59.739
Hey, Woo-jae.

1:01:10.625 --> 1:01:13.336
<i>I'm going to be happy.</i>

1:01:38.695 --> 1:01:40.029
Who are you kidding?

1:02:01.217 --> 1:02:02.301
Am I interrupting?

1:02:03.469 --> 1:02:05.012
I'm kind of stuck today.

1:02:05.847 --> 1:02:06.764
What's up?

1:02:08.891 --> 1:02:11.102
I was organizing
some clothes in the bedroom,

1:02:12.311 --> 1:02:14.147
and this fell out of your purse.

1:02:15.898 --> 1:02:17.233
I was wondering what it was.

1:02:19.277 --> 1:02:21.821
Oh, right. I told you before.

1:02:21.904 --> 1:02:24.824
Li-sa threw and broke Ju-yeong's phone.

1:02:26.117 --> 1:02:27.368
But why do you have it?

1:02:28.202 --> 1:02:31.205
She's really something.
I bought her a new phone,

1:02:31.289 --> 1:02:34.333
and she told me to go through it
if I got bored. There was nothing.

1:02:38.004 --> 1:02:39.380
There was something.

1:02:54.061 --> 1:02:55.646
Did you already see this?

1:02:56.230 --> 1:02:57.064
Yes.

1:02:59.650 --> 1:03:01.527
Don't get the wrong idea. Ms. Gu and I--

1:03:01.611 --> 1:03:02.695
I don't.

1:03:04.947 --> 1:03:07.909
You look really irritated in that video.

1:03:11.579 --> 1:03:14.207
Others may get the wrong idea, but not me.

1:03:16.709 --> 1:03:19.045
Should I be relieved or frightened?

1:03:20.963 --> 1:03:25.176
Maybe it's for the better. Be careful
not to cause any misunderstandings.

1:03:30.139 --> 1:03:32.433
By the way, I wonder why she took that.

1:03:35.144 --> 1:03:37.438
Maybe Ms. Gu told her to.

1:03:40.942 --> 1:03:42.276
The teacher

1:03:42.860 --> 1:03:45.530
who visited Ju-yeong's
and counseled her several times

1:03:46.030 --> 1:03:47.281
was Gu Hae-won.

1:03:49.700 --> 1:03:51.536
People who aren't well-off

1:03:51.619 --> 1:03:54.372
tend to get attached
to teachers who give them attention.

1:03:58.417 --> 1:04:01.754
Maybe Ju-yeong's the one who told her
where Li-sa's dance studio is.

1:04:02.463 --> 1:04:03.422
What?

1:04:03.506 --> 1:04:06.592
Ms. Gu came to her dance studio
to apologize to her.

1:04:07.802 --> 1:04:09.345
I was wondering how she found out.

1:04:12.765 --> 1:04:16.936
There's definitely something
going on between Ms. Gu and Ju-yeong.

1:04:17.019 --> 1:04:18.813
I'll meet with Ju-yeong again--

1:04:18.896 --> 1:04:21.649
No, focus on your exhibition.
Leave this to me.

1:04:28.322 --> 1:04:31.284
I don't want to cause a commotion
until our school gets approved.

1:04:31.367 --> 1:04:33.035
I'll take care of it.

1:04:34.370 --> 1:04:36.789
This is under my jurisdiction now.

1:04:38.666 --> 1:04:39.750
I'll let you be.

1:04:52.221 --> 1:04:55.057
<i>THE MEANING OF SILENCE,
FROM DRAWING TO CARVING</i>

1:05:18.706 --> 1:05:20.166
<i>THE MEANING OF SILENCE,
FROM DRAWING TO CARVING</i>

1:05:20.249 --> 1:05:23.878
<i>Who's the artist?
I heard that you handpicked him.</i>

1:05:24.420 --> 1:05:28.132
<i>You wouldn't know even if I told you.
At least not yet.</i>

1:05:28.215 --> 1:05:31.344
<i>I'll introduce you during the reception.</i>

1:05:50.988 --> 1:05:53.616
Doesn't it leave
a strong impression despite being bland?

1:05:54.533 --> 1:05:57.411
I love it. I truly do.

1:05:58.204 --> 1:06:03.459
You know, I used to prefer arts
that were majestic and spectacular.

1:06:04.085 --> 1:06:08.089
Ones that expressed anger
towards violence in society

1:06:08.172 --> 1:06:10.341
and strived to save mankind through art.

1:06:12.593 --> 1:06:15.930
Back in college, I had a crush
on a senior who studied sculpting.

1:06:16.013 --> 1:06:17.181
This is what he said.

1:06:17.264 --> 1:06:19.517
He didn't even like to see me smile.

1:06:19.600 --> 1:06:21.310
He despised laziness.

1:06:22.728 --> 1:06:26.107
He said wealthy women who did this
as a hobby could never create art.

1:06:27.650 --> 1:06:29.944
He loathed how poor he was

1:06:30.695 --> 1:06:32.780
but also used it as a shield.

1:06:35.491 --> 1:06:37.827
You must've liked him a lot.

1:06:38.494 --> 1:06:40.788
It sounds like you're pining for him.

1:06:40.871 --> 1:06:42.206
Back then, yes.

1:06:43.249 --> 1:06:46.168
Back then, I believed pitying him

1:06:46.252 --> 1:06:48.629
and torturing myself
was considered sublime love.

1:06:49.797 --> 1:06:53.801
I'm curious about his work.
It must be so captivating.

1:06:53.884 --> 1:06:57.763
He's dead. He was devastated
by this world's lack of understanding.

1:06:58.431 --> 1:07:00.224
And he destroyed all his work.

1:07:05.271 --> 1:07:08.899
That's why I love your work.

1:07:08.983 --> 1:07:10.818
Your purpose is clear,

1:07:10.901 --> 1:07:14.321
yet the audience can make
their own interpretations. I love that.

1:07:15.573 --> 1:07:19.035
You should've written
the testimonial for my exhibition.

1:07:19.118 --> 1:07:21.829
I was turned away
for being such a passionate fan.

1:07:22.830 --> 1:07:23.748
Ma'am.

1:07:24.749 --> 1:07:25.875
By her.

1:07:25.958 --> 1:07:28.085
-This way.
-Okay.

1:07:30.671 --> 1:07:32.089
Watch your step.

1:07:33.716 --> 1:07:37.678
This must be your first time
attending a reception in a while.

1:07:37.762 --> 1:07:41.557
The artist is someone
I am taking extra care of.

1:07:43.476 --> 1:07:46.520
This is his first exhibition,
so he must be tense.

1:07:47.271 --> 1:07:49.023
And he knows no one in Korea.

1:07:49.982 --> 1:07:53.360
He was too sick to work on any
for a while.

1:07:55.488 --> 1:07:57.656
Please guide him well.

1:07:57.740 --> 1:07:59.241
Sure.

1:08:03.662 --> 1:08:06.123
-I see you put in a lot of effort.
-Yes, a bit.

1:08:22.139 --> 1:08:23.265
Sir.

1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.377
<i>I came without any attachments,</i>

1:10:15.461 --> 1:10:17.296
<i>but why haven't you put anything aside?</i>

1:10:17.379 --> 1:10:18.881
<i>Is this funny to you?</i>

1:10:18.964 --> 1:10:21.008
<i>I'm sorry for leaving you all alone.</i>

1:10:21.091 --> 1:10:23.302
<i>Does it look like I'm worried
and nervous to you?</i>

1:10:23.886 --> 1:10:26.138
<i>All of the things that I missed out on,</i>

1:10:26.222 --> 1:10:27.890
<i>I'm going to make it
the way it should have been.</i>
