<i>When I was a child, I would
come to this park and play.</i>

00:43.144 --> 00:46.678
<i>My grandmother told me</i>
<i>why the bamboo is here.</i>

00:46.680 --> 00:51.483
<i>She said, "It is waiting</i>
<i>for the wind to touch it.</i>

00:51.485 --> 00:53.619
<i>"It is filled with emotion."</i>

00:56.090 --> 00:59.591
<i>Listen to the sound</i>
<i>and you can feel that.</i>

03:29.643 --> 03:34.313
The guy with the cigarette's the man. Liu is his name.
He decides what to buy.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.014
So how are we doing?

03:36.016 --> 03:38.050
They got problems
with the TV package.

03:38.052 --> 03:40.052
That's why we flew in
on such short notice.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.987
They seem to be
enjoying themselves.

03:41.989 --> 03:45.023
So who's the competition?
Germans already been here?

03:45.025 --> 03:47.759
Hoffmann came in yesterday.
Aha! Right on time.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.262
Show time.

03:50.264 --> 03:54.399
The director has real concerns
about your programming package.

03:54.401 --> 03:59.404
He says your programs are pornographic,
violent and superstitious.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.640
As they are.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.842
Have you lost your mind?

04:03.844 --> 04:06.745
We've made a recommendation
and would like you to comment.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.414
Your great Chairman Mao
once said...

04:09.416 --> 04:11.984
Excuse this pronunciation.
I'm sorry.

04:15.522 --> 04:18.223
"Use the West
for Chinese purposes."

04:18.225 --> 04:20.524
Is that true? Or am I mistaken?

04:20.527 --> 04:23.528
If our programming
teaches your people

04:23.530 --> 04:28.400
that America is imperfect,
often violent and prurient,

04:28.402 --> 04:32.638
wouldn't that tend to discourage
the pursuit of Western values?

04:38.212 --> 04:41.713
With some deletions, perhaps we
can come to an understanding.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.515
Let us talk among ourselves.

05:22.756 --> 05:25.157
David. Nice work, Jack.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.493
They're buying
the package outright.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.495
Great. Minus <i> The Brady Bunch.</i>

05:30.497 --> 05:33.832
Which deviates from party mandate.
One child per family.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.672
Mr. McAndrews, welcome.

05:41.275 --> 05:42.307
Dan.

05:42.309 --> 05:44.376
Hello, Jack. Hi.

05:44.377 --> 05:46.444
My father offers a thousand
apologies if he kept you waiting.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.713
Please.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.019
David McAndrews, welcome.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.188
Mr. Jack Moore.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.070
Mr. Lin. Mr. Moore.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.026
Please come in. Thank you.

06:01.028 --> 06:05.797
David is an old friend. He is the
first Western businessman I met

06:05.799 --> 06:10.168
after my appointment to the Ministry
of Radio, Film and Television.

06:10.170 --> 06:15.240
He was the one who convinced me
that not all foreigners have horns.

06:15.242 --> 06:19.644
Only some. I ran into Gerhardt
Hoffmann in Beijing today.

06:19.646 --> 06:23.248
Yes. Mr. Hoffmann.
HoffCo Telekomm.

06:23.250 --> 06:28.420
He gives the appearance of
tremendous enthusiasm.

06:28.422 --> 06:33.425
My son told me how skillfully you
softened our very stubborn censor.

06:33.427 --> 06:36.895
Yes, we reached
a meeting of minds.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.997
There are those
in my government

06:38.999 --> 06:43.402
who wish to severely limit the
flow of Western entertainment.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.839
And there are those
who are impatient,

06:47.841 --> 06:50.275
who wish
the floodgates released.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.178
Like my son.

06:53.180 --> 06:58.850
But there must be a happy medium.
We must proceed with balance.

07:00.354 --> 07:03.555
<i>¶ Young man,</i>
<i>there's no need to feel down</i>

07:03.557 --> 07:07.292
<i>¶ I said, young man,</i>
<i>pick yourself off the ground</i>

07:07.294 --> 07:10.629
<i>¶ I said, young man,</i>
<i>'cause you're in a new town.</i>

07:10.631 --> 07:12.063
Is this how you imagined China?

07:12.065 --> 07:15.434
<i>¶ There's no need to be unhappy</i>

07:15.436 --> 07:18.703
<i>¶ Young man,</i>
<i>there's a place you can go</i>

07:18.705 --> 07:20.705
<i>¶ I said, young man</i>

07:20.707 --> 07:22.474
<i>¶ When you're short</i>
<i>on your dough</i>

07:22.476 --> 07:26.211
<i>¶ You can stay there</i>
<i>and I'm sure you will find</i>

07:26.213 --> 07:30.715
<i>¶ Many ways to have a good time</i>

07:32.653 --> 07:36.755
<i>¶ It's fun to stay</i>
<i>at the Y-M-C-A</i>

07:36.757 --> 07:40.225
<i>¶ It's fun to stay</i>
<i>at the Y-M-C-A</i>

07:42.162 --> 07:45.230
<i>¶ They have everything</i>
<i>that you need to enjoy</i>

07:45.232 --> 07:47.966
<i>¶ You can hang out</i>
<i>with all the boys ¶</i>

07:51.472 --> 07:52.971
What are they saying?

07:52.973 --> 07:57.175
"Is it good? Is it great? Let's
do it one more time, baby!"

08:31.011 --> 08:34.813
So is this what your father would
construe as "proceeding with balance"?

08:34.815 --> 08:38.316
My father has the power to make
things happen, but he rarely uses it.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.652
He's going to be using it
on behalf of McAndrews.

08:40.654 --> 08:44.556
I like your style, Jack. I like
the way you cut to the chase.

08:44.558 --> 08:45.957
You do your homework.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.634
Why do you need this deal
to happen so much?

08:59.573 --> 09:03.575
I want my son to grow up in a different
China than the one that exists today.

09:06.146 --> 09:10.248
We could be an unbeatable
partnership, you and I.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.885
Especially with my backers
over there.

09:18.725 --> 09:22.160
Yeah. We can talk about that
after the deal goes through.

09:23.497 --> 09:25.363
Of course.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.499
We can discuss this
further tomorrow.

09:27.501 --> 09:31.570
Tonight we celebrate the first
Chinese-American satellite joint venture.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.238
How much?

10:13.313 --> 10:14.779
Oh, Dan paid for it.

10:57.591 --> 10:58.790
Mine?

11:01.695 --> 11:05.196
You call Americans
"big noses," don't you?

11:09.002 --> 11:12.003
These are great.
These are really great.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.274
Do you mind?

11:18.679 --> 11:20.679
What have we got here? Maillol.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.050
And a Henry Moore.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.720
Rodin. Correct?

11:29.356 --> 11:31.022
Yes, correct.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.075
THE GRAPEVINE <i> PLAYING)</i>

11:50.077 --> 11:51.976
I should be getting you home.

11:51.978 --> 11:55.714
<i>¶ Ooh, I bet you're wondering</i>
<i>how I knew</i>

11:55.716 --> 11:58.717
<i>¶ 'Bout your plans</i>
<i>to make me blue</i>

11:59.653 --> 12:03.188
<i>¶ With some other guy</i>
<i>you knew before</i>

12:03.190 --> 12:07.826
<i>¶ Between the two of us guys</i>
<i>you know I love you more</i>

12:07.828 --> 12:12.163
<i>¶ It took me by surprise</i>
<i>I must say</i>

12:12.165 --> 12:15.834
<i>¶ When I found out yesterday</i>

12:15.836 --> 12:20.338
<i>¶ Don't you know that I heard
it through the grapevine</i>

12:20.340 --> 12:24.342
<i>¶ Not much longer</i>
<i>would you be mine</i>

12:24.344 --> 12:28.379
<i>¶ Oh, I heard it</i>
<i>through the grapevine</i>

12:28.381 --> 12:32.417
<i>¶ Oh, and I'm just about</i>
<i>to lose my mind</i>

12:32.419 --> 12:35.253
<i>¶ Honey, honey, yeah</i> Lips.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.623
<i>¶ Not much longer</i>
<i>would you be mine, baby</i>

12:40.794 --> 12:44.929
<i>¶ I know a man</i>
<i>ain't supposed to cry</i>

12:44.931 --> 12:48.433
<i>¶ But these tears I can't

12:49.569 --> 12:53.204
<i>¶ Losin' you would mean</i>
<i>my life, you see</i>

12:53.206 --> 12:56.775

13:01.414 --> 13:02.647
Breast.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.878
What is it?
Who were you talking to?

14:45.151 --> 14:47.185
I know <i> meishi.</i>

14:47.187 --> 14:49.388
<i>Meishi</i> means,
"It doesn't matter."

14:59.165 --> 15:00.598
That's pretty.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.776
Hand.

15:15.382 --> 15:18.116
I wanna hold your hand.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.052
Yeah, that's right.

15:21.054 --> 15:25.223
¶ I wanna hold your hand
¶ ...hand.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.625
¶ I want to hold your hand ¶
¶ I want to hold your hand ¶

15:34.901 --> 15:36.668
Whoa. Wait a minute.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.505
What's happening here?

15:55.055 --> 15:56.220
Oh, my God.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.391
Help me. What is...

16:00.961 --> 16:02.694
Please! Wait.

16:03.229 --> 16:04.629
Get a doctor.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.632
Lin.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.509
Do you speak English?

16:21.748 --> 16:23.047
I'm American.

16:33.593 --> 16:34.659
Ah!

16:36.763 --> 16:38.029
Wait.

16:52.278 --> 16:53.611
Let me go.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.522
I'm an American citizen.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.365
Finally. Hello.

17:21.407 --> 17:22.906
Jack Peter Moore.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.809
Yes, that's right.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.211
English no good. So...

17:30.249 --> 17:32.183
You have refused to cooperate
and answer questions.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.818
No one has asked anything.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.321
Did you rape
and murder Hong Ling?

17:37.323 --> 17:41.059
You've made a big mistake!

17:41.061 --> 17:42.326
There is no mistake.

17:42.328 --> 17:45.396
I have the right
to contact my embassy.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.865
You have no rights. No, no. I have
a right to contact the embassy.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.034
I would like to talk
to my embassy.

17:50.036 --> 17:52.437
Your case will be tried
according to the laws of

17:52.439 --> 17:54.005
the People's Republic of China.

17:54.007 --> 17:56.841
I would like to talk to the American Embassy.
Do you understand me?

17:56.843 --> 17:59.110
First the investigation.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.712
Did you rape Hong Ling before
or after you murdered her?

18:01.714 --> 18:05.049
I want to talk to my embassy.
Please translate this.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.517
I would like to see
an attorney.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.861
The sign says, "Leniency
for those who confess.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.097
"Severity for those
who resist."

18:19.899 --> 18:21.599
I'm not resisting, and I...

18:32.545 --> 18:35.780
It can be more easy
if you confess your crime.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.005
<i>You okay?</i> Yeah.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.921
<i>I brought along Ed Pratt.</i>

19:16.923 --> 19:19.323
<i>We're only allowed five minutes,
so let me make it crisp.</i>

19:19.325 --> 19:21.259
<i>As Senior Consular Officer</i>
<i>at the embassy.</i>

19:21.261 --> 19:23.361
<i>I need some information</i>
<i>about the night in question.</i>

19:23.363 --> 19:26.330
You bring me the Senior Consular Officer?
<i>Hear him out.</i>

19:26.332 --> 19:29.600
<i>The embassy is trying to
track through what happened.</i>

19:29.602 --> 19:31.335
<i>Can you give me some details?</i>

19:33.439 --> 19:35.840
I met her.
We went back to the hotel.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.008
We...

19:37.010 --> 19:39.277
Hello?

19:42.048 --> 19:45.550
I can't hear.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.592
It's off! I can't hear anything.
This doesn't work.

19:50.456 --> 19:54.158
Doesn't work. The phone doesn't work.
<i>Yes? Hello?</i>

19:54.160 --> 19:57.628
<i>The gentleman says we can't talk about
the details of the investigation.</i>

19:57.630 --> 19:59.547
What can we talk about?

19:59.548 --> 20:01.465
<i>You're on Chinese soil, and
you're subjected to Chinese law.</i>

20:01.467 --> 20:04.802
<i>You can discuss the investigation
only with your lawyer.</i>

20:04.804 --> 20:07.672
Get me a lawyer. Call Joe
Shapiro in Washington.

20:07.674 --> 20:10.708
Ask him who's plugged in here.
<i>That's a non-starter.</i>

20:10.710 --> 20:13.344
<i>Non-Chinese lawyers aren't
allowed to practice here.</i>

20:13.346 --> 20:15.846
<i>There are three or four Chinese
criminal lawyers who could handle</i>

20:15.848 --> 20:18.316
<i>a case of this magnitude, but
none of them will touch it.</i>

20:18.318 --> 20:21.652
<i>The procuracy will appoint a
defense advocate for your case.</i>

20:21.654 --> 20:24.422
<i>We'll get you bail.</i>

20:24.424 --> 20:27.925
<i>There again, I should
warn you, it's very rare.</i>

20:27.927 --> 20:31.529
<i>It's called a guarantee,</i>
<i>and it almost never happens.</i>

20:31.531 --> 20:36.901
Ed, I'm sure it's very rare, but
I would assume the ambassador...

20:36.903 --> 20:39.237
<i>Ambassador Reed is in Shanghai.</i>

20:39.239 --> 20:43.608
I assume that he could even possibly
from Shanghai, make a few phone calls.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.743
Use his influence. <i> Absolutely.</i>

20:45.745 --> 20:48.346
<i>He'll do everything</i>
<i>he can for you.</i>

20:48.348 --> 20:52.250
<i>Naturally, as ambassador, you
juggle your crises in the interests</i>

20:52.252 --> 20:54.185
<i>of pushing out the envelope</i>
<i>for many parties.</i>

20:54.187 --> 20:57.355
We're really gonna be
pushing that envelope now.

20:57.357 --> 21:00.424
You're gonna get me a copy of
the criminal code in English.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.128
<i>I can certainly try.</i>

21:04.130 --> 21:05.363
Thanks, Ed.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.591
What is he saying? Who is he?

22:16.369 --> 22:20.404
This is General Hong. You
killed Hong Ling, his daughter.

22:26.879 --> 22:30.681
All right. You tell him that I did
not kill her. Go on, tell him.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.385
I understand.

22:34.387 --> 22:36.520
I understand your grief.

22:36.522 --> 22:40.691
I understand your pain that
comes from losing a child

22:41.661 --> 22:43.527
but I did not kill her.

22:55.475 --> 22:56.807
What did he say?

22:57.643 --> 22:59.610
He said he will see you dead.

23:00.313 --> 23:02.146
I say it again.

23:02.148 --> 23:05.449
It can be more easy
if you confess your crime.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.409
<i>Jack Peter Moore,</i>

23:31.411 --> 23:34.345
<i>you are charged with</i>
<i>intentional homicide and rape</i>

23:34.347 --> 23:36.680
<i>with aggravating circumstances.</i>

23:36.682 --> 23:39.450
<i>Does any participant</i>
<i>in these proceedings</i>

23:39.452 --> 23:42.186
<i>challenge the composition</i>

23:42.188 --> 23:46.023
<i>Procurator Ma? No challenge,

23:46.025 --> 23:49.326
<i>Does the defense aide challenge
the composition of the court?</i>

23:49.562 --> 23:50.628
Huh?

23:54.983 --> 23:57.066
<i>I'm sorry. Can you please</i>
<i>speak a little louder?</i>

23:57.069 --> 23:59.870

<i>I was with Chief Li</i>

24:12.752 --> 24:14.385
<i>You're excused, Advocate.</i>

24:16.289 --> 24:19.523
<i>Accused Moore, do you understand
the charges against you?</i>

24:31.003 --> 24:35.272
What I understand is I have
never met my attorney before.

24:35.274 --> 24:39.310
<i>Advocate Shen Yuelin, have</i>
<i>you not met with the accused?</i>

24:41.080 --> 24:42.413
<i>Presiding Chairman...</i>

24:43.483 --> 24:46.584
Wait a minute.
I've lost the sound.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.752
I can't hear anything.
What is she saying?

24:48.754 --> 24:50.254
Wait.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.990
I don't hear. I've lost the sound.
I can't hear anything.

24:54.093 --> 24:57.094
What? I can't...
This is very important...

24:57.096 --> 25:00.831
Can you hear me now,
accused Moore?

25:05.605 --> 25:07.471
<i>Can you hear me?</i>
<i>Can you hear me now?</i>

25:07.473 --> 25:09.974
Yes, I hear.

25:09.976 --> 25:13.777
I would like my attorney I have never
met to repeat what she has said.

25:19.785 --> 25:22.887
<i>I told Chairman Xu I was
assigned this case only today</i>

25:22.889 --> 25:25.055
<i>but I'm familiar with facts</i>
<i>of the investigation.</i>

25:25.057 --> 25:28.325
How could you... You never
spoke with your client!

25:28.327 --> 25:31.128
You must address the court
in the proper manner.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.902
I'm sorry. What is the
proper manner, Your Honor?

25:37.904 --> 25:41.138
Accused Moore,
please be seated now.

25:41.874 --> 25:44.308
All right.

25:44.310 --> 25:47.144
<i>Advocate Shen Yuelin,</i>
<i>what does the accused plead</i>

25:47.146 --> 25:48.879
<i>to these charges?</i>

25:50.716 --> 25:53.384
<i>The accused pleads guilty.</i>
The hell I do!

25:55.922 --> 26:00.157
The defense attorney represents
the accused, not the State!

26:00.159 --> 26:02.493
Do you speak English?

26:03.996 --> 26:05.229
Yes.

26:08.501 --> 26:11.569
I am not pleading guilty.
You will change the plea.

26:11.938 --> 26:13.003
No.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.773
Fine. I want another lawyer.

26:15.775 --> 26:18.576
There is no other lawyer
who will agree to defend you.

26:18.578 --> 26:22.012
Only because the Ministry of
Justice requested my service

26:22.014 --> 26:23.747
have I assumed this role.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.550
Assuming the role requires
listening to the facts

26:26.552 --> 26:28.586
which you seem unwilling to do!

26:28.588 --> 26:30.220
Let me share with you
the facts.

26:30.222 --> 26:34.558
A foreigner takes a girl to bed
after knowing her for a few hours

26:34.560 --> 26:36.026
and consuming much liquor.

26:36.028 --> 26:38.028
Next morning she is dead.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.464
The foreigner says he is innocent.
I am.

26:40.466 --> 26:42.066
His hands are covered
with her blood,

26:42.068 --> 26:45.336
and his fingerprints are
all over the murder weapon.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.273
With a guilty plea,
the court may be persuaded

26:49.275 --> 26:51.875
by my arguments
of extenuating circumstances.

26:51.877 --> 26:55.813
Alcohol, perhaps even momentary insanity
to be lenient in your sentencing.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.915
I was not insane.
I'm not pleading guilty.

26:57.917 --> 27:01.285
If you plead not guilty, the judge
and the two members of the public

27:01.287 --> 27:03.821
sitting next to her,
called "People's Assessors"

27:03.823 --> 27:06.423
will be offended
by your unrepentant attitudes.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.959
Their majority vote
will determine your fate.

27:11.931 --> 27:16.400
In our country, moral education of
criminals is of great importance.

27:16.402 --> 27:19.403
Leniency is granted
to those who confess.

27:19.405 --> 27:20.971
Severity is required...
Yes, I know that.

27:20.973 --> 27:23.574
...for those who stubbornly
insist on their innocence.

27:23.576 --> 27:26.443
Therefore,
it would be wise of you

27:26.445 --> 27:29.079
to treat our legal system
with respect.

27:29.081 --> 27:33.117
Spare me the lecture on the
morality of your judicial system.

27:33.119 --> 27:37.054
If you plead not guilty, you
will be sentenced to death.

27:37.957 --> 27:40.457
And, unlike in your country,
Mr. Moore,

27:40.459 --> 27:43.460
sentences are carried out
within a week.

27:43.462 --> 27:47.865
You will be shot, and the cost of
bullet will be billed to your family.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.333
I'm innocent!

27:49.335 --> 27:51.435
You truly believe
you are innocent?

27:51.437 --> 27:52.770
Yes, I know I am!

27:52.772 --> 27:55.105
How do you know?
How can you be certain?

27:55.107 --> 27:57.474
You were unconscious when the
police came to your room.

27:57.476 --> 28:00.544
I was asleep. You had consumed
an excess of alcohol.

28:00.546 --> 28:04.148
An enormous amount was consumed,
by anybody's standards!

28:04.150 --> 28:06.517
I know what I did
and did not do!

28:06.519 --> 28:08.285
How can you be sure of anything

28:08.287 --> 28:12.790
while under the influence
of so much alcohol?

28:12.792 --> 28:14.692
How can you ever be certain?

28:19.465 --> 28:23.534
In China, we hold
the welfare of the State

28:23.536 --> 28:26.970
above that of the individual.

28:26.972 --> 28:30.741
We have six times the
population of your country,

28:30.743 --> 28:33.277
and one-tenth the crime rate.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.480
Tell me, who is right?

28:37.817 --> 28:39.883
Your plea is guilty.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.163
What?

28:53.165 --> 28:54.531
What is happening?

29:06.112 --> 29:08.679
<i>Courtesy of your embassy, the
Chinese criminal law code</i>

29:08.681 --> 29:10.614
<i>translated into English.</i>
Great. Thanks.

29:10.616 --> 29:14.852
<i>Jack, you should know that your
advocate is one of our best.</i>

29:14.854 --> 29:17.721
<i>She got permission for my visit.
Very unusual.</i>

29:17.723 --> 29:19.123
Where's Ghery?

29:19.125 --> 29:20.791
<i>He's giving his deposition.</i>

29:20.793 --> 29:23.427
About what?

29:23.428 --> 29:26.062
<i>His knowledge of the case. He
has no firsthand knowledge</i>

29:26.065 --> 29:28.799
<i>but I'm sure he'll give you a
crackerjack character reference.</i>

29:28.801 --> 29:32.369
We don't have much time here. What
kind of coverage are we getting?

29:32.371 --> 29:34.705
<i>The embassy seems convinced it's
wiser to keep a lid on this.</i>

29:34.707 --> 29:37.374
<i>It's good strategy. There are
questions of face involved.</i>

29:37.376 --> 29:39.743
<i>And geopolitically, there are
certain trade issues pending</i>

29:39.745 --> 29:42.446
<i>which ensure you</i>
<i>a fairer shot than usual.</i>

29:43.415 --> 29:45.649
Is McAndrews still in Tokyo?

29:45.651 --> 29:49.119
<i>It's agreed that a visit from
Mr. McAndrews would be imprudent.</i>

29:49.121 --> 29:52.222
Yeah. Right.

29:52.224 --> 29:56.226
<i>Jack, as you know,</i>
<i>this is a dangerous time.</i>

29:56.228 --> 29:58.395
<i>There are powerful forces</i>
<i>for change</i>

29:58.397 --> 30:01.165
<i>and there are powerful forces</i>
<i>of resistance.</i>

30:01.167 --> 30:04.101
<i>The old guard sees the murder
of Hong Ling as justification</i>

30:04.103 --> 30:06.403
<i>for their campaign</i>
<i>against spiritual pollution.</i>

30:09.675 --> 30:10.941
Sorry.

30:10.943 --> 30:13.477
<i>No politics. House rules.</i>

30:13.479 --> 30:14.812
<i>Excuse me.</i>

30:20.920 --> 30:22.486
<i>You like</i> Star Trek, <i> Jack?</i>

30:23.823 --> 30:26.040
What?

30:26.041 --> 30:28.258
Star Trek, <i> with Captain James Kirk.
The original.</i>

30:28.260 --> 30:30.527
<i>I have all 79 segments on tape.</i>

30:30.529 --> 30:32.112
Good.

30:32.113 --> 30:33.873
<i>Programming now</i>
<i>just doesn't compare.</i>

30:34.300 --> 30:36.533
<i>It offers only violence.</i>

30:36.535 --> 30:38.068
<i>Wouldn't you agree?</i>

30:39.638 --> 30:42.172
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

30:42.174 --> 30:45.108
<i>I'm going to do everything</i>
<i>in my power to help you.</i>

30:45.110 --> 30:47.110
<i>There are those</i>
<i>in my government</i>

30:47.112 --> 30:52.182
<i>who wish to severely limit the
flow of Western entertainment.</i>

30:52.184 --> 30:55.552
<i>And there are those who wish</i>
<i>the floodgates released.</i>

30:56.822 --> 30:59.022
<i>Is there anyone</i>
<i>you want us to notify?</i>

30:59.458 --> 31:00.924
<i>Any family?</i>

31:05.197 --> 31:08.365
So they know where to send the bill for the bullet?
No, I don't think so.

31:27.253 --> 31:28.485
Hello?

31:35.995 --> 31:37.494
Hello.

32:58.577 --> 33:01.578
<i>Tell me of your relationship
with Hong Ling.</i>

33:01.580 --> 33:03.580
<i>We laughed. We had fun.</i>

33:03.582 --> 33:06.950
<i>No expectations,</i>
<i>just a terrific night.</i>

33:06.952 --> 33:11.621
Is one night the typical duration
of your relationship with women?

33:11.623 --> 33:13.423
I didn't choose the duration.

33:13.425 --> 33:18.595
Next time you pick your sexual partners,
you might wish to know more about them.

33:18.597 --> 33:21.732
You will make my job
a lot easier.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.708
<i>Did you have the knife</i>
<i>tested for blood?</i>

33:31.710 --> 33:35.178
<i>Yes. The blood on the knife</i>
<i>is that of the victim.</i>

33:35.180 --> 33:36.880
<i>When you first saw the accused,</i>

33:36.882 --> 33:39.716
<i>what was your assessment</i>
<i>of his condition?</i>

33:39.718 --> 33:42.786
<i>A strong smell of alcohol</i>
<i>was coming from him.</i>

33:42.788 --> 33:45.122
<i>He was unsteady, confused.</i>

33:45.124 --> 33:47.290
<i>He seemed surprised by it all.</i>

33:50.529 --> 33:53.063
<i>Did you find alcohol</i>
<i>in the room?</i>

33:53.065 --> 33:57.901
<i>Two empty bottles of champagne and
two empty bottles of Scotch whiskey.</i>

33:57.903 --> 34:00.637
<i>I have no further questions</i>
<i>for this witness.</i>

34:00.639 --> 34:01.938
<i>Advocate Shen Yuelin.</i>

34:05.477 --> 34:09.379
<i>What time did you receive the call about
screams coming from the accused's room?</i>

34:10.315 --> 34:12.349
<i>Approximately 5:45.</i>

34:12.351 --> 34:14.751
<i>And they entered</i>
<i>the accused's room when?</i>

34:15.387 --> 34:17.353
<i>6:04 a.m.</i>

34:17.356 --> 34:21.224
<i>How would you describe</i>
<i>the accused's state of mind?</i>

34:22.161 --> 34:25.062
<i>Surprised.</i>

34:25.063 --> 34:28.103
<i>In the situation, would you describe
"surprised" as a rational response?</i>

34:28.266 --> 34:29.766
<i>No.</i>

34:29.768 --> 34:33.937
<i>Would you describe "surprised"</i>
<i>as a sane response?</i>

34:33.938 --> 34:36.339
<i>What was he waiting for,</i>
<i>his own arrest?</i>

34:36.341 --> 34:37.574
Objection!

34:38.677 --> 34:40.911
I'd like to confer
with my advocate, Your Honor.

34:45.784 --> 34:48.051
I am not insane.

34:48.053 --> 34:51.288
I was not drunk. I am not going
to plead diminished capacity.

34:51.290 --> 34:55.725
I am obliged to do what is
required to avoid your execution.

34:55.726 --> 35:00.430
<i>Advocate, does the defense have
further questions for this witness?</i>

35:00.432 --> 35:02.699
Yes, I have questions.
I am not finished.

35:02.701 --> 35:06.736
According to article 26
of the criminal procedure law,

35:06.738 --> 35:10.307
or article 32 of the amended
version of the same,

35:10.309 --> 35:12.609
I have the right
to defend myself,

35:12.611 --> 35:15.545
to comment on and ask
questions of witnesses

35:15.547 --> 35:18.215
even if my advocate
has already questioned them.

35:18.217 --> 35:22.719
Accused Moore, this right
is rarely exercised.

35:22.721 --> 35:25.555
I know, but I do have the right
to exercise it, Your Honor.

35:25.557 --> 35:29.793
The appropriate form of
address is Presiding Chairman.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.799
You may proceed.

35:37.169 --> 35:38.535
Ask your question.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.571
Thank you, Presiding Chairman.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.243
Captain,

35:46.245 --> 35:51.314
you testified that
you entered my room at 6:04.

35:51.316 --> 35:56.219
When you entered, was the blood on
my hands and my shirt wet or dry?

35:59.458 --> 36:01.691
<i>Dry.</i> Dry.

36:01.693 --> 36:04.761
The screams were heard at 5:45.

36:04.763 --> 36:08.932
Wouldn't it have taken more than 19
minutes for so much blood to dry?

36:10.102 --> 36:11.334
<i>Usually, yes.</i>

36:11.336 --> 36:15.272
So the murder must've
taken place before 5:45 a.m.

36:16.108 --> 36:17.274
<i>Perhaps.</i>

36:17.276 --> 36:19.809
If the murder took place
before 5:45,

36:19.811 --> 36:22.345
who was there
to scream at 5:45?

36:24.349 --> 36:26.349
<i>Perhaps you.</i> Perhaps me?

36:26.351 --> 36:28.391
Why would I
have been screaming?

36:28.787 --> 36:30.620
You were drunk.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.789
<i>Two bottles of Scotch</i>
<i>had been emptied.</i>

36:32.791 --> 36:35.892
Not two bottles of Scotch.
Only one bottle.

36:35.894 --> 36:39.135
I ordered one bottle. You can verify
that from room service records.

36:44.002 --> 36:46.703
<i>Your fingerprints were found</i>
<i>on both bottles.</i>

36:46.705 --> 36:50.674
<i>The hotel records show</i>
<i>that two bottles were ordered.</i>

36:50.676 --> 36:53.710
Accused Moore,
are you finished?

37:04.189 --> 37:05.889
Accused Moore,

37:05.891 --> 37:08.558
are you quite finished?

37:08.560 --> 37:11.995
Just one more question,
Presiding Chairman.

37:12.998 --> 37:16.533
Captain, did you find
a gold locket

37:16.535 --> 37:18.895
on or about the person
of the victim, Hong Ling?

37:20.205 --> 37:22.405
<i>I have no information</i>
<i>about a locket.</i>

37:22.407 --> 37:26.076
There was a locket there. I'm sure there was.
Where is it now?

37:33.619 --> 37:36.419
What? I'm sorry,
I didn't get a translation.

37:36.955 --> 37:38.355
Why are they laughing?

37:39.524 --> 37:42.192
Presiding Chairman,
how can I mount a defense

37:42.194 --> 37:44.728
if I can't understand
the procurator?

37:44.730 --> 37:47.931
The People's Assessor may not be
interested in listening, but I am!

37:54.439 --> 37:56.539
Accused Moore,

37:56.541 --> 38:00.644
what the procurator said that
brought levity to this court

38:00.646 --> 38:03.647
was that perhaps the victim
had a magic wand

38:03.649 --> 38:07.984
and turned the locket into
a second bottle of Scotch.

38:11.890 --> 38:15.058
Are you finished now,
accused Moore?

38:23.235 --> 38:24.701
Yes, I am finished.

38:27.139 --> 38:28.872
<i>The court is dismissed.</i>

38:33.645 --> 38:36.980
In our country, it is wise
not to raise questions

38:36.982 --> 38:39.342
to which you do not
know the answer.

38:39.418 --> 38:41.918
My country, too.

38:41.920 --> 38:46.022
If you wished to have law books, you
should have requested them from me.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.615
<i>I hear you've been questioned.</i>

39:45.150 --> 39:48.385
Then you appreciate
my situation.

39:48.387 --> 39:49.886
<i>You should go home.</i>

39:49.888 --> 39:53.123
What should I tell David
about Hoffmann?

39:53.558 --> 39:55.225
<i>Tell David</i>

39:56.328 --> 39:58.995
<i>to let HoffCo</i>
<i>have the satellite.</i>

39:58.997 --> 40:02.165
<i>Concentrate on American</i>
<i>content and production.</i>

40:02.167 --> 40:04.667
<i>Make Hoffmann pay</i>
<i>through the nose.</i>

40:04.669 --> 40:07.904
<i>You think the world's waiting</i>
<i>for programming from Bonn?</i>

40:08.707 --> 40:10.240
<i>I doubt it.</i> Yeah.

40:13.178 --> 40:16.246
If a Chinese guy woke up
at the Plaza Hotel

40:17.616 --> 40:20.049
with a dead American girl
in his suite

40:20.051 --> 40:23.186
and the Chinese government tried
to muscle in on his trial,

40:23.188 --> 40:24.587
I see the point.

40:24.589 --> 40:26.956
Your lawyer's very good.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.859
She even got a few dissidents off.
<i>Go on.</i>

40:29.861 --> 40:31.761
<i>Give my best</i>
<i>to Janie and the kids.</i>

40:32.531 --> 40:34.364
I will.

40:34.366 --> 40:36.933
<i>Get out of here.</i> Thanks, Jack.

40:36.935 --> 40:38.334
I'll be back.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.040
<i>Mr. Moore,</i>

40:51.283 --> 40:53.950
<i>I have some questions</i>
<i>to ask you</i>

40:55.720 --> 40:56.986
<i>but...</i>

40:59.391 --> 41:03.960
<i>If you still prefer that I
resign, I will do as you wish.</i>

41:08.733 --> 41:10.400
<i>No, I do not prefer.</i>

41:16.441 --> 41:17.807
Roll it, please.

41:20.412 --> 41:23.446
What is my country girl
with a city mouth looking for?

41:23.448 --> 41:25.548
The truth about my client.

41:30.422 --> 41:32.222
Wait. Freeze it.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.660
Hit "play."

41:37.662 --> 41:40.597
I have a certain sympathy
for your American.

41:40.599 --> 41:43.366
One man against everyone.

41:43.802 --> 41:45.034
Very cool.

41:47.105 --> 41:48.905
Peng, back it up.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.113
Stop.

42:26.645 --> 42:28.278
What are you doing?

42:38.757 --> 42:40.390
You cannot have this book!

44:09.481 --> 44:12.515
I wish to speak of the locket
you said Hong Ling was wearing.

44:12.517 --> 44:14.150
She was wearing a locket.

44:14.152 --> 44:17.320
I know. I have confirmation.

44:17.322 --> 44:19.422
Confirmation?
You didn't believe me?

44:20.425 --> 44:22.859
The locket was a gift
from her father.

44:22.861 --> 44:24.761
He asked for its return.

44:24.763 --> 44:25.862
Where is it?

44:26.464 --> 44:27.997
It has not been found.

44:29.634 --> 44:31.234
You find that insignificant?

45:00.298 --> 45:01.531
Open this.

45:08.373 --> 45:10.707
I have already examined this.

45:13.378 --> 45:14.711
Smell it.

45:19.384 --> 45:20.624
What do you smell?

45:24.689 --> 45:27.323
Something strange. Exactly.

45:29.627 --> 45:31.928
<i>Dr. Tao, do you detect</i>
<i>a chemical odor on this shirt?</i>

45:33.164 --> 45:34.831
<i>A familiar chemical odor?</i>

45:34.833 --> 45:36.833
<i>These questions</i>
<i>serve no purpose.</i>

45:37.602 --> 45:39.102
<i>We will see.</i>

45:39.838 --> 45:41.704
<i>Continue.</i>

45:41.706 --> 45:45.942
<i>Give us your expert opinion as to
what you believe the odor to be.</i>

45:45.944 --> 45:49.579
<i>Maybe chloroform</i>
<i>or an ether derivative.</i>

45:49.581 --> 45:53.049
<i>Could chloroform or ether be used
to render someone unconscious?</i>

45:53.051 --> 45:56.586
<i>Yes, it could. These questions
waste the court's time.</i>

45:56.588 --> 46:00.022
<i>I will make that decision.</i>
<i>Continue.</i>

46:00.024 --> 46:04.594
Presiding Chairman, the accused
had neither chloroform nor ether

46:04.596 --> 46:07.797
in his possession at the time
he entered the country

46:07.799 --> 46:12.902
and no authorization was issued for
him to purchase either chemical.

46:12.904 --> 46:15.938
Neither chemical was found
in his hotel room.

46:17.075 --> 46:19.442
These chemicals
must have been brought

46:19.444 --> 46:22.478
to the crime scene
by someone else.

46:22.480 --> 46:26.249
By the someone else who
rendered Mr. Moore unconscious.

46:26.251 --> 46:29.218
By the someone else
who murdered Hong Ling.

46:30.088 --> 46:31.587
Presiding Chairman,

46:31.589 --> 46:35.858
the accused wishes to change
his plea to "not guilty."

46:40.565 --> 46:42.632
<i>The court is dismissed.</i>

49:09.314 --> 49:13.149
And I want to see any of Hong Ling's
effects gathered at the scene.

49:13.151 --> 49:15.751
Why do you put yourself
at risk for this foreigner?

49:15.753 --> 49:17.653
He was attacked last night.

49:17.655 --> 49:20.389
Because he is a foreigner.

49:20.391 --> 49:22.825
I may not be able
to protect you this time.

49:22.827 --> 49:25.294
Thank you for your concern,
Division Chief Li.

50:06.437 --> 50:07.903
Good morning, Mr. Moore.

50:10.274 --> 50:13.594
I was informed that you
were attacked last night.

50:14.345 --> 50:16.045
Are you okay? I'm all right.

50:16.047 --> 50:17.446
What am I doing here?

50:17.448 --> 50:19.448
It is a provisional guarantee.

50:19.450 --> 50:23.552
The court will not meet today so
that we may prepare your defense.

50:23.554 --> 50:25.721
So the embassy
finally got off its ass.

50:25.723 --> 50:29.892
You must return to
confinement at nightfall.

50:31.629 --> 50:33.362
Would you like some tea?

50:35.700 --> 50:37.933
Yes, tea. Please.

51:19.510 --> 51:21.077
You play the piano?

51:21.079 --> 51:25.081
I am teaching myself.
My progress is slow.

51:25.083 --> 51:29.151
When I was younger, I played the
Chinese instrument, the pipa.

51:30.188 --> 51:32.121
The what? Pipa.

51:40.431 --> 51:41.864
What does it sound like?

51:43.768 --> 51:45.201
We have much to do.

51:45.203 --> 51:46.769
No, please.

51:47.438 --> 51:48.771
Play for me.

51:56.881 --> 51:59.201
I'd just like to hear
some music again.

52:38.656 --> 52:40.156
You have beautiful hands.

52:43.594 --> 52:44.760
Why did you stop?

52:45.997 --> 52:48.664
We have little time
and much to do.

52:56.474 --> 52:58.007
My grandmother.

53:08.719 --> 53:10.799
It's a great honor to meet you.

53:26.971 --> 53:29.238
So, your parents are deceased?

53:29.240 --> 53:30.472
Yeah.

53:31.475 --> 53:33.075
And brothers and sisters?

53:34.145 --> 53:35.211
No.

53:35.680 --> 53:37.079
And a wife?

53:38.482 --> 53:40.549
No wife.

53:40.551 --> 53:43.886
For us, to be without a family
is a terrible thing.

53:44.589 --> 53:46.655
But you never married.

53:46.657 --> 53:49.825
I have been unable to find
a man who's not threatened

53:49.827 --> 53:52.428
by a woman's intelligence.

53:52.430 --> 53:55.297
With half a billion men in this
country, it's hard to believe.

53:55.666 --> 53:57.466
Yes, isn't it?

53:58.736 --> 54:02.938
You had a prestigious and
expensive education at Harvard

54:02.940 --> 54:04.873
and Stanford Law School.

54:04.875 --> 54:06.275
I had scholarships.

54:07.245 --> 54:09.912
I served drinks
at rich people's parties.

54:09.914 --> 54:13.582
You pursued law because you wanted to
be one of the rich people you served?

54:14.452 --> 54:16.452
I wanted to be in control.

54:16.454 --> 54:17.686
And were you?

54:20.358 --> 54:21.598
I thought I was.

54:22.093 --> 54:23.392
Until now.

54:23.394 --> 54:24.593
Yeah.

54:36.907 --> 54:39.108
You asked me if I had a wife.
I said no.

54:40.278 --> 54:41.944
I don't, but I did.

54:43.047 --> 54:45.447
We had a daughter,
seven years old.

54:46.651 --> 54:50.519
They were in a taxi in San Francisco.
There was an accident.

54:53.391 --> 54:54.690
I am sorry.

54:56.127 --> 54:58.368
Anything else you want to know?

55:06.237 --> 55:08.470
What was your first contact
with Hong Ling?

55:09.106 --> 55:10.639
Do you think I killed her?

55:11.342 --> 55:13.575
My job is to find the truth,

55:13.577 --> 55:15.811
to handle this case
according to law.

55:16.814 --> 55:18.514
Do you believe me or not?

55:20.251 --> 55:23.519
I have growing questions about
what happened that night.

55:25.589 --> 55:29.158
Now, please tell me of your
first contact with Hong Ling.

55:41.872 --> 55:44.106
Did you approach her?

55:44.108 --> 55:48.377
No, she was modeling.
Some kind of a fashion show.

55:48.379 --> 55:50.012
You simply saw her?

55:51.449 --> 55:52.781
We saw each other.

55:52.783 --> 55:54.383
Your eyes met?

55:55.886 --> 55:57.920
I guess so. Are you sure?

55:58.956 --> 56:00.689
Yes, I'm sure.

56:02.893 --> 56:05.134
So you were attracted to her?

56:06.864 --> 56:08.897
Yes, I was attracted.

56:11.135 --> 56:13.435
Because she was beautiful?

56:18.743 --> 56:20.242
I guess so.

56:36.594 --> 56:41.096
You approached her later
when you saw her at the table?

56:41.899 --> 56:44.600
I was over there.
She was over here.

56:44.602 --> 56:47.903
She was looking at me
and drawing something.

56:49.173 --> 56:51.907
So you were curious,
then you approached her?

56:52.543 --> 56:54.009
What was she drawing?

56:56.013 --> 56:57.346
My nose.

56:58.349 --> 57:00.816
She said, <i> "Da bi zi."</i>

57:07.191 --> 57:10.526
It means big nose. Yeah.

57:10.528 --> 57:11.794
Thanks.

57:13.397 --> 57:17.933
We were sitting there and talking
and looking at her drawings

57:19.570 --> 57:20.869
and laughing.

57:24.308 --> 57:25.507
We just clicked.

57:25.943 --> 57:27.443
"Clicked"?

57:27.445 --> 57:30.746
You mean chemistry.
Is that the right word?

57:30.748 --> 57:33.048
Mmm-hmm. Chemistry, clicked.

57:34.885 --> 57:38.720
So you are a romantic.

57:38.722 --> 57:40.489
You were drawn to each other.

57:43.160 --> 57:44.560
Did you kiss?

57:48.566 --> 57:49.798
Not here.

58:04.448 --> 58:06.815
To return here
is difficult for you.

58:14.358 --> 58:19.161
Do you remember anything
unusual happening? Think back.

58:19.163 --> 58:20.929
Is that the proper way
to say it?

58:20.931 --> 58:22.231
That's fine.

58:29.673 --> 58:33.375
She got a phone call.
It upset her.

58:33.377 --> 58:36.378
On the hotel phone?
No, it was on her cellular.

58:38.516 --> 58:40.782
She said it was nothing.
Period. <i> Meishi.</i>

58:40.784 --> 58:42.684
<i>Meishi. Meishi. Meishi.</i>

58:43.854 --> 58:45.187
Anything else?

58:47.157 --> 58:48.457
She said...

58:53.297 --> 58:54.596
Does that mean anything?

58:56.800 --> 58:59.167
You did not hear her scream?
No.

58:59.169 --> 59:02.371
Someone made an anonymous call
to the police claiming

59:02.373 --> 59:04.534
to hear screams
coming from this suite.

59:08.178 --> 59:10.546
This is an old hotel, isn't it?

59:13.250 --> 59:15.450
It's very solidly constructed.

59:16.487 --> 59:18.954
Outer door and an inner door.

59:27.598 --> 59:30.118
It's all right. <i>Meishi. Meishi.</i>

59:32.937 --> 59:34.169
You hear anything?

59:34.171 --> 59:35.904
No. Come.

59:40.844 --> 59:43.946
These are objects Hong Ling
had with her in this room.

59:45.416 --> 59:47.449
The police developed
the pictures.

59:59.463 --> 01:00:04.433
The last call she made
on this phone was 517857.

01:00:04.435 --> 01:00:05.934
It has been disconnected.

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:11.073
There must be a central
telephone exchange.

01:00:11.075 --> 01:00:14.610
That's where the billing records are kept.
We are going there now.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:17.379
Why are you smiling?

01:00:17.381 --> 01:00:19.542
I usually figure out
the next step.

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:25.921
This must be extremely difficult
to rely on a stranger, a woman,

01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:28.657
a foreign woman,
in such a serious matter.

01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:29.899
That's why I smiled.

01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:37.165
You will wait here, please.

01:01:23.947 --> 01:01:26.448
<i>...has selected HoffCo Telekomm</i>

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:30.052
<i>as China's partner</i>
<i>in this multibillion-dollar</i>

01:01:30.054 --> 01:01:31.953
<i>satellite undertaking.</i>

01:01:55.679 --> 01:01:56.912
What's wrong?

01:01:59.483 --> 01:02:02.563
The records cannot be accessed.
They have been deleted.

01:02:03.654 --> 01:02:04.820
By whom?

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:09.338
Do not talk about this here.

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:13.662
Who deleted the records?

01:02:13.664 --> 01:02:16.665
Who has the power
to delete telephone records?

01:02:16.667 --> 01:02:19.501
You couldn't delete
your own telephone records.

01:02:19.503 --> 01:02:24.506
Only a government official could
authorize the deletion of his records.

01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:26.742
Is that it? Is that true?

01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:29.211
Whoever Ling called
that night...

01:02:29.213 --> 01:02:31.046
Might know something
about what happened.

01:02:31.048 --> 01:02:32.714
Do not say more.
We must leave now.

01:02:32.716 --> 01:02:35.751
If that person is an official of a
government I'm negotiating with...

01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:40.021
If I could be embarrassed
or discredited in some way,

01:02:40.023 --> 01:02:42.524
maybe he gets a better deal
with my competitor.

01:02:42.526 --> 01:02:43.792
Sweet system you've got here.

01:02:43.794 --> 01:02:45.927
The records were not deleted
by the system.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:47.896
They were deleted
by an individual.

01:02:47.898 --> 01:02:51.099
Individual. I'll go with that.
Who do we have?

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:55.370
We have Minister Lin Shou
and <i> Herr</i> Hoffmann.

01:02:55.372 --> 01:02:58.373
What about General Hong?
It is not General Hong.

01:02:58.375 --> 01:03:01.376
Why not? He's got influence with the
PSB, with the prisons, with everybody.

01:03:01.378 --> 01:03:05.447
General Hong is not corrupt. He only
wants his daughter's killer punished.

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.883
He's old guard!
He's losing control.

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:09.584
You do not understand.

01:03:09.586 --> 01:03:14.222
You do not understand! This is a
satellite communications deal!

01:03:14.224 --> 01:03:17.292
And for better or for worse, the
effect of the McAndrews deal

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:19.227
would have been to open
a totally closed system.

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:22.798
Who are you to criticize? Once the
system opens up, there's no going back.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:26.568
You come from a country where the infant
mortality rate is higher than ours.

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:28.804
The reason you know that is
we don't delete the records.

01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:31.239
Where people are punished
for the color of their skin.

01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:33.809
Have you ever been there?
You find it easy to assume

01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:38.079
that a Chinese father would kill his
daughter to stop your business deal.

01:03:38.081 --> 01:03:40.015
I do not find that easy
to assume.

01:03:40.017 --> 01:03:43.418
How many people are killed each
week in your peaceful country?

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.086
I don't find that
easy to assume.

01:03:45.088 --> 01:03:46.588
How many?

01:03:50.828 --> 01:03:52.093
Too many.

01:05:55.052 --> 01:05:57.052
I gotta go. Don't!

01:05:57.054 --> 01:05:58.987
Jack, they'll kill you!

01:06:12.569 --> 01:06:13.802
Stop!

01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:25.880
Sorry.

01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:39.027
Get outta my way!

01:06:58.982 --> 01:07:00.582
Look out!

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.546
Shit.

01:08:07.284 --> 01:08:08.850
Shh! Shh!

01:12:22.939 --> 01:12:25.540
Open up! I'm an American
citizen seeking asylum!

01:12:28.712 --> 01:12:31.546
May I see your passport, sir?

01:12:31.548 --> 01:12:33.829
If I had a passport,
I wouldn't need asylum.

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:39.454
Please, you've gotta let me in.

01:12:39.456 --> 01:12:40.855
Let me make a phone call.

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:53.801
Oh, man.

01:12:54.637 --> 01:12:56.404
Pratt, I'm requesting asylum.

01:12:56.406 --> 01:12:59.574
This is a confidential matter. This is
not the place to hold this discussion.

01:12:59.576 --> 01:13:02.643
Very good acoustics. This used
to be the Pakistani Embassy.

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:06.381
Before that, it was wired to the
hilt by the PRC. Follow me.

01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:14.389
This, however,
is entirely bug-free.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.993
Mr. Moore. Peyton Reed.

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:26.734
The ambassador has already been summoned
to see the Minister of External Affairs.

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:30.338
This has the makings
of a full-scale incident.

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.939
A full-scale incident!

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:36.511
I'm sorry I didn't call
for an appointment.

01:13:41.718 --> 01:13:44.798
Do the two of you have any
idea what I've been through?

01:13:48.191 --> 01:13:49.590
I am not leaving here.

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:51.559
No one said you should leave.

01:13:51.561 --> 01:13:53.094
I'm not going.

01:13:53.096 --> 01:13:54.362
No, you're in.

01:13:54.364 --> 01:13:56.697
But getting out
is another story.

01:13:56.699 --> 01:13:58.866
You've gotten other people out.
You can get me out.

01:13:58.868 --> 01:14:02.804
It took us a year to get
those Chinese physicists out

01:14:02.806 --> 01:14:05.973
and the Chinese Army threatened
to storm the embassy.

01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:09.076
That was a simple asylum case.
You're charged with a capital crime.

01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:11.813
Once this becomes an international
dick-measuring contest

01:14:11.815 --> 01:14:13.495
they might never let you leave.

01:14:20.824 --> 01:14:23.791
What? What is it?

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:27.128
Your attorney is
at the guard station.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.764
She wishes to see you.
I would advise no contact.

01:14:29.766 --> 01:14:31.899
It will only make things
harder for her.

01:14:32.735 --> 01:14:34.135
What are you talking about?

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:35.803
Yuelin put up your guarantee.

01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:37.839
I thought the embassy
put it up.

01:14:37.841 --> 01:14:41.943
In China, bail has nothing to do with money.
It's reputation.

01:14:41.945 --> 01:14:44.912
To have you released today so
that she could prepare a defense.

01:14:44.914 --> 01:14:48.316
Shen Yuelin put up
her career, her future.

01:14:48.952 --> 01:14:50.985
It was really quite unique.

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:03.898
Yuelin.

01:15:06.269 --> 01:15:08.669
Your shoulder. It's all right.

01:15:11.608 --> 01:15:14.775
If I'd known what you did for
me, I wouldn't have left.

01:15:14.777 --> 01:15:16.110
I'm glad you left.

01:15:16.112 --> 01:15:17.545
"Glad"?

01:15:17.547 --> 01:15:21.883
Yes. Because I am not sure
I could have saved you

01:15:21.885 --> 01:15:23.818
from the decision of the court.

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:28.689
I... I could not
have lived with that.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.861
Why did you risk your life for
me if you didn't believe me?

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:38.599
I always assumed
the worst about you.

01:15:39.402 --> 01:15:41.102
I have never questioned.

01:15:42.171 --> 01:15:44.972
I have always accepted things.

01:15:44.974 --> 01:15:47.808
It is the same
as when I was a child.

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:48.876
Why?

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:52.813
I was blind. I was mute.

01:15:53.816 --> 01:15:55.149
When you were a child

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:59.487
it was during the Cultural
Revolution, wasn't it?

01:16:00.156 --> 01:16:01.489
Yes.

01:16:05.762 --> 01:16:08.396
What is it?

01:16:08.398 --> 01:16:13.267
I went to school until they closed
down and everything went mad.

01:16:16.105 --> 01:16:19.273
I do not know
if you could understand this.

01:16:19.609 --> 01:16:20.908
Try me.

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:28.349
I watched...

01:16:28.351 --> 01:16:32.253
I watched my father be
humiliated, and I said nothing.

01:16:33.723 --> 01:16:37.358
I watched my father be
spat on. I did nothing.

01:16:38.795 --> 01:16:44.265
I even watched my classmates
pour black ink over his head

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:48.002
one after another
and after another.

01:16:50.573 --> 01:16:52.106
What did I do?

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:58.045
I hid my head in shame
while he was dragged away.

01:17:03.987 --> 01:17:06.387
I never questioned.

01:17:06.389 --> 01:17:08.489
I was blind.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.895
I'm very sorry that I did
not believe your innocence.

01:17:18.668 --> 01:17:20.735
But now, I do.

01:17:23.106 --> 01:17:24.472
I do.

01:17:54.037 --> 01:17:56.604
Somebody alerted the press.
Let's get you out of here

01:17:56.606 --> 01:17:59.173
before your face is on the
cover of <i> Time</i> and <i> Newsweek.</i>

01:21:17.139 --> 01:21:19.673
A certain general
has a personal interest

01:21:19.675 --> 01:21:23.177
in seeing that some
of this evidence is returned.

01:21:23.179 --> 01:21:26.680
If, by chance, any one
of the arresting officers

01:21:26.682 --> 01:21:29.817
pocketed this evidence
and it is not returned,

01:21:29.819 --> 01:21:34.555
then even an attorney as good as I
am cannot ensure your well-being.

01:21:36.325 --> 01:21:39.426
I suggest you search again.
Anything you turn up

01:21:39.428 --> 01:21:42.069
can be given to my aide and brought
to the court for safekeeping.

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:50.931
<i>I need your counsel.</i>

01:22:50.933 --> 01:22:53.000
<i>I want you to walk away</i>
<i>from this.</i>

01:22:53.002 --> 01:22:57.671
I'm trying to get access to evidence which
would help to prove your innocence.

01:22:57.673 --> 01:22:59.306
<i>I want you to walk away now.</i>

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:01.075
<i>Why did you not do the same?</i>

01:23:01.077 --> 01:23:03.777
<i>The smart thing would have</i>
<i>been to stay at the embassy.</i>

01:23:03.779 --> 01:23:07.681
<i>Yeah, and move past it.</i>
<i>Yes, I do that really well.</i>

01:23:07.683 --> 01:23:08.916
<i>Why did you not?</i>

01:23:16.359 --> 01:23:19.026
<i>Did you ever see</i>
<i>little girls play soccer?</i>

01:23:19.028 --> 01:23:22.363
Little, silly bundles of energy

01:23:22.365 --> 01:23:25.332
just swarming all over each
other, tripping on each other.

01:23:27.269 --> 01:23:29.870
Hair ribbons left on the
ground when they're through.

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:32.606
<i>Your daughter?</i>

01:23:33.442 --> 01:23:34.908
<i>Yeah. They were...</i>

01:23:43.386 --> 01:23:47.654
<i>They were driving back from a
game when the accident happened.</i>

01:23:47.656 --> 01:23:49.490
<i>And you were?</i>

01:23:49.492 --> 01:23:51.291
<i>I was in Tokyo.</i>

01:23:51.293 --> 01:23:52.793
<i>I was...</i>

01:23:55.531 --> 01:23:57.798
<i>I was closing a deal.</i>

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.367
<i>I could have finished it the
day before if I'd wanted to.</i>

01:24:02.038 --> 01:24:04.004
<i>You cannot blame yourself.</i>

01:24:04.006 --> 01:24:06.340
No, I didn't. I set it aside.

01:24:06.342 --> 01:24:09.209
<i>I just moved past it.</i>
<i>Built a wall around it.</i>

01:24:12.415 --> 01:24:15.749
<i>Hired somebody to close up</i>
<i>the house in San Francisco.</i>

01:24:15.751 --> 01:24:17.918
<i>I got on a plane,</i>

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:21.055
<i>went somewhere to do something.</i>

01:24:22.658 --> 01:24:24.725
And I did it again and again

01:24:25.761 --> 01:24:27.127
and I ended up here.

01:24:30.266 --> 01:24:33.167
<i>But what you leave behind</i>
<i>catches up with you.</i>

01:24:35.071 --> 01:24:37.137
<i>Took me a long time</i>
<i>to learn that.</i>

01:24:40.776 --> 01:24:43.677
<i>If I had stayed in the embassy,
you would have been in danger.</i>

01:24:43.679 --> 01:24:45.746
I am not moving past this.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:52.753
<i>Jack.</i>

01:24:55.024 --> 01:24:57.091
<i>You once offered to resign.</i>

01:24:59.929 --> 01:25:03.097
<i>I want you to do that now.</i>

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:10.971
<i>My duty is to prove</i>
<i>your innocence.</i>

01:25:10.973 --> 01:25:12.773
<i>It is also...</i>

01:25:13.309 --> 01:25:15.709
<i>It is also my wish.</i>

01:25:17.379 --> 01:25:18.779
<i>Courage.</i>

01:27:41.924 --> 01:27:43.257
Shen Yuelin.

01:27:56.772 --> 01:27:58.639
Why did you come here?

01:27:58.641 --> 01:28:00.440
I am hero.

01:28:01.477 --> 01:28:05.812
A record of calls made
to and from her cell phone

01:28:05.814 --> 01:28:07.781
and a printout at home.

01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:11.051
Where did you get this?

01:28:11.053 --> 01:28:14.955
My friend Mai. She say I am
the world's greatest lover.

01:28:14.957 --> 01:28:16.857
And now I am hero, too.

01:28:20.729 --> 01:28:24.998
Peng, how did you talk your way
past the security man outside?

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.301
I did not have to.
There was nobody there.

01:28:31.106 --> 01:28:33.874
Come. You leave now.
Go on, leave.

01:29:11.013 --> 01:29:14.614
It doesn't brighten the situation that
your attorney got roughed up last night.

01:29:16.118 --> 01:29:19.386
<i>My attorney got what?</i>
She was a trace roughed up.

01:29:20.122 --> 01:29:21.688
A little bruised is all.

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:23.990
<i>Bruised? What... By who?</i>

01:29:23.992 --> 01:29:26.026
She didn't know who.

01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:29.396
She was in the hotel suite
where the victim expired.

01:29:29.398 --> 01:29:31.998
<i>She's more shook up than anything.
</i> Stop. Go back.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.768
I'm afraid
there's no stopping it now.

01:29:34.769 --> 01:29:37.537
<i>The instant you left sanctuary you way
overshot any point of possible return.</i>

01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:38.739
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what you're saying!</i>

01:29:38.741 --> 01:29:40.974
You left the embassy
out on a limb.

01:29:40.976 --> 01:29:42.175
<i>We've got zero options.</i>

01:29:42.177 --> 01:29:45.145
<i>The embassy? What about her?</i>

01:29:45.147 --> 01:29:47.314
<i>You didn't make our job easier.</i>

01:29:47.316 --> 01:29:48.815
<i>All right!</i>

01:29:50.586 --> 01:29:52.919
<i>What about her?</i>
<i>I told you not to talk to her.</i>

01:29:52.921 --> 01:29:56.089
<i>How can I not? She's the one putting
herself on the line for me!</i>

01:29:56.658 --> 01:29:58.492
<i>She's not our job.</i>

01:30:03.932 --> 01:30:05.966
<i>She's out there all alone,</i>
<i>isn't she?</i>

01:30:12.074 --> 01:30:13.440
<i>Yes.</i>

01:31:00.589 --> 01:31:01.788
What happened?

01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:03.890
I have the telephone records.
Are you all right?

01:31:03.892 --> 01:31:06.460
Whatever government official
called Hong Ling that night

01:31:06.462 --> 01:31:10.897
also had conversations with a
PSB officer named Huan Minglu.

01:31:10.899 --> 01:31:13.400
It doesn't matter.
I don't want you hurt.

01:31:13.402 --> 01:31:15.969
I have requested
his presence in court today.

01:31:16.772 --> 01:31:19.639
It does matter. It will matter.

01:31:24.746 --> 01:31:26.246
Why are you doing this?

01:31:27.749 --> 01:31:33.019
You could be taken from your
house and your grandmother.

01:31:33.021 --> 01:31:37.224
You could be sent away,
put here or worse.

01:31:40.095 --> 01:31:41.561
So why are you doing it?

01:31:46.335 --> 01:31:49.169
I'm doing this because

01:31:49.171 --> 01:31:51.905
I do not wish
to be silent anymore.

01:32:16.665 --> 01:32:19.900
Supervising judges.
They are here to monitor.

01:32:19.902 --> 01:32:22.536
It means today is the day.

01:32:22.538 --> 01:32:25.071
Procurator General Yang
next to General Hong.

01:32:25.073 --> 01:32:27.307
And many of the party elders.

01:32:31.813 --> 01:32:34.648
<i>This final session</i>
<i>of our People's Court</i>

01:32:34.650 --> 01:32:39.486
<i>hearing criminal case 4116</i>
<i>is now open.</i>

01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:44.891
<i>Court is in session.</i>
<i>Advocate Shen Yuelin.</i>

01:32:44.893 --> 01:32:49.863
Presiding Chairman, I wish to summon
Huan Minglu to the witness stand.

01:32:49.865 --> 01:32:52.332
<i>Huan Minglu has not been</i>
<i>introduced as a witness.</i>

01:32:52.334 --> 01:32:55.502
This man may know the truth
of what happened to Hong Ling.

01:32:55.504 --> 01:32:59.406
<i>Advocate Shen Yuelin, this appears
to be a diversionary tactic.</i>

01:33:00.509 --> 01:33:02.776
<i>This is pure manipulation</i>
<i>of the facts.</i>

01:33:02.778 --> 01:33:06.012
<i>Advocate Shen Yuelin,</i>
<i>request denied.</i>

01:33:06.014 --> 01:33:08.415
Presiding Chairman,
I can offer evidence

01:33:08.417 --> 01:33:12.786
that Huan Minglu attacked the
accused and me in Dazhalan...

01:33:12.788 --> 01:33:15.789
<i>Such evidence is outside</i>
<i>the scope of this proceeding.</i>

01:33:15.791 --> 01:33:19.593
...and attempted to murder the accused
in Beijing Number One Detention Center.

01:33:19.595 --> 01:33:21.428
<i>I must protest once more.</i>

01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:26.099
This is crucial evidence that
suggests the accused is innocent.

01:33:26.868 --> 01:33:29.569
<i>Advocate Shen Yuelin,</i>

01:33:29.571 --> 01:33:32.439
<i>there's a procedure for
bringing any unrelated charges.</i>

01:33:32.441 --> 01:33:34.474
When will that be?

01:33:34.476 --> 01:33:38.378
After my client is sentenced
or after he is executed?

01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:39.879
Answer me, please.

01:33:40.415 --> 01:33:42.282
<i>Enough!</i>

01:33:42.284 --> 01:33:45.752
<i>We must call an end to testimony
only indirectly related.</i>

01:33:45.754 --> 01:33:47.754
Presiding Chairman...

01:33:47.756 --> 01:33:49.222
<i>Will you please sit down?</i>

01:33:55.897 --> 01:33:57.597
No, Presiding Chairman.

01:33:59.901 --> 01:34:01.768
<i>What did you say?</i>

01:34:01.770 --> 01:34:04.404
A man's life is at stake.

01:34:04.406 --> 01:34:08.074
Not an American life,
not a Chinese life.

01:34:08.076 --> 01:34:10.110
A man's life.

01:34:10.112 --> 01:34:15.081
In such circumstances what I am asking
is not an unreasonable request.

01:34:19.254 --> 01:34:22.155
<i>I will decide what is</i>
<i>reasonable and unreasonable.</i>

01:34:23.458 --> 01:34:24.724
<i>Now sit down.</i>

01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:30.230
<i>I said, sit down.</i>

01:34:31.166 --> 01:34:33.099
<i>The matter is decided.</i>

01:34:33.101 --> 01:34:36.836
<i>The court is not interested in
the testimony of such witnesses.</i>

01:34:39.841 --> 01:34:41.074
<i>I am.</i>

01:34:41.677 --> 01:34:43.610
<i>You are what?</i>

01:34:43.612 --> 01:34:46.613
<i>I am interested in hearing.</i>
<i>What about you?</i>

01:34:49.785 --> 01:34:51.251
<i>I have already ruled.</i>

01:34:58.026 --> 01:35:00.443
<i>Why not?</i>

01:35:00.444 --> 01:35:02.861
Presiding Chairman, the vote
on this matter is two to one.

01:35:02.864 --> 01:35:06.132
With the approval of the court, I
summon Huan Minglu as a witness.

01:35:23.185 --> 01:35:25.625
What's happening?
What's going on?

01:35:32.594 --> 01:35:34.894
You cut the sound.
I've lost the sound again!

01:35:34.896 --> 01:35:38.198
It's okay. The Procurator
General wishes to see me.

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:39.365
Why do they want you?

01:35:39.367 --> 01:35:41.501
Trust me.
Everything will be okay.

01:35:41.503 --> 01:35:42.902
I'll be right back.

01:36:20.809 --> 01:36:22.108
<i>Be seated.</i>

01:36:28.083 --> 01:36:30.984
<i>I declare the People's Beijing</i>
<i>Intermediate Court</i>

01:36:30.986 --> 01:36:35.488
<i>hearing criminal case 4116</i>
<i>once again open.</i>

01:36:37.993 --> 01:36:40.994
Defense advocate
is not present.

01:36:40.996 --> 01:36:42.562
Nor is her legal aide.

01:36:42.564 --> 01:36:44.164
<i>Then the witness</i>
<i>should step down.</i>

01:36:45.233 --> 01:36:46.666
No, wait a minute.

01:36:48.136 --> 01:36:50.937
Yes, accused Moore?

01:36:50.939 --> 01:36:53.239
I believe I'm entitled
to question this witness.

01:36:53.241 --> 01:36:57.644
Your right to question has
been previously established.

01:36:57.646 --> 01:37:01.080
You may do so,
briefly and to the point.

01:37:25.841 --> 01:37:27.173
I cannot sign it.

01:37:29.344 --> 01:37:33.379
At approximately 2:00 a.m.
on the morning of the murder,

01:37:33.381 --> 01:37:37.350
records indicate you received a
call from an unlisted cell phone.

01:37:37.352 --> 01:37:39.452
You remember
who made that call?

01:37:39.454 --> 01:37:41.788
<i>Irrelevant! This is a waste
of the court's time.</i>

01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:44.858
You may proceed, accused
Moore, but please be direct

01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:49.796
or even your friends, the People's
Assessors, may lose their patience.

01:37:49.798 --> 01:37:51.558
Do you remember who called you?

01:37:52.801 --> 01:37:54.167
<i>It was the wrong number.</i>

01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:55.702
"Wrong number"?

01:37:55.704 --> 01:37:57.804
Then why did the call
last five minutes?

01:37:59.574 --> 01:38:03.014
<i>Maybe it was someone
talkative, like the accused.</i>

01:38:04.312 --> 01:38:06.145
Presiding Chairman,
would you instruct the witness

01:38:06.147 --> 01:38:07.881
to wipe the smirk off his face?

01:38:17.726 --> 01:38:19.692
I cannot sign it.

01:38:19.694 --> 01:38:23.596
Then you'll be dismissed of
your duties and disciplined.

01:38:23.598 --> 01:38:26.432
Accused Moore,
I am losing my patience.

01:38:26.434 --> 01:38:28.835
Get to the point before
I dismiss the witness.

01:38:28.837 --> 01:38:32.739
Have you ever served as a guard
for any government official?

01:38:35.911 --> 01:38:37.277
<i>Yes.</i>

01:38:37.279 --> 01:38:39.712
Have you ever met
Minister Lin Shou?

01:38:39.714 --> 01:38:40.847
Irrelevant.

01:39:07.275 --> 01:39:10.510
Have you ever met General Hong
or his daughter?

01:39:11.546 --> 01:39:12.779
Irrelevant.

01:39:12.781 --> 01:39:16.449
I have already ruled against
this line of questioning.

01:39:16.451 --> 01:39:20.820
All right.
As an officer in the PSB,

01:39:21.957 --> 01:39:24.390
did you ever work
in a prison...

01:39:24.392 --> 01:39:26.159
<i>Beyond the scope of this hearing.
</i> Sustained.

01:39:26.161 --> 01:39:27.727
Are you finished?

01:39:27.729 --> 01:39:29.562
No, I am not!

01:39:29.564 --> 01:39:33.566
On the evening of April 10, did not
you and two accomplices rough me up

01:39:33.568 --> 01:39:35.568
in Detention Center Number One?

01:39:35.570 --> 01:39:36.836
<i>Beyond the scope</i>
<i>of this hearing.</i>

01:39:36.838 --> 01:39:38.938
Sustained. On April 11th,

01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:41.741
while I was sitting
in a PSB car in Dazhalan

01:39:41.743 --> 01:39:43.810
did you not attack me
and my attorney?

01:39:45.447 --> 01:39:46.579
<i>Irrelevant.</i>

01:39:46.581 --> 01:39:48.414
I have not finished
this line of questioning.

01:39:48.416 --> 01:39:49.782
I have lost my patience.

01:39:49.784 --> 01:39:55.321
Why will you not let this
witness answer my questions?

01:39:55.323 --> 01:39:57.824
He just sits there,
laughing at me!

01:39:58.526 --> 01:40:00.159
Laughing and lying!

01:40:01.196 --> 01:40:03.296
Where's my attorney?

01:40:03.298 --> 01:40:05.698
Causing too much trouble? Is
that why you dragged her out?

01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:09.268
You are in contempt.
If that's the case,

01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:12.038
why don't you let her go
and stay with me?

01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:15.808
You've already measured my coffin!
I said you are in contempt!

01:40:15.810 --> 01:40:18.578
You think I give a shit?
Are you gonna shoot me twice?

01:40:19.447 --> 01:40:21.848
Let my attorney go and take me.

01:40:21.850 --> 01:40:27.720
I don't have any money, but my
shoes will pay for the bullet.

01:40:27.722 --> 01:40:31.624
Put a nice drop cloth down. Put a
bullet right in the back of my head.

01:40:31.626 --> 01:40:33.559
Do it right here. Bullet
in the back of my head!

01:40:34.295 --> 01:40:36.629
Bam! Bam! Bam!

01:40:36.631 --> 01:40:38.798
Do it right here right now!
I don't want to wait!

01:41:43.198 --> 01:41:45.364
<i>We will now proceed</i>
<i>to final arguments</i>

01:41:45.366 --> 01:41:47.567
<i>if Procurator Ma is prepared.</i>

01:41:47.569 --> 01:41:49.168
<i>Presiding Chairman...</i>

01:42:07.889 --> 01:42:09.188
For you.

01:42:13.128 --> 01:42:15.461
Your lawyer is very persuasive.

01:42:38.453 --> 01:42:42.388
Presiding Chairman, I wish to
call an additional witness.

01:42:43.091 --> 01:42:44.490
<i>This has no precedent.</i>

01:42:45.293 --> 01:42:46.826
<i>I have already ruled.</i>

01:43:05.613 --> 01:43:09.015
<i>...multibillion-dollar</i>
<i>satellite undertaking.</i>

01:43:11.219 --> 01:43:12.685
Presiding Chairman,

01:43:12.687 --> 01:43:15.388
I apologize to the court.

01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:19.559
I request the court's permission
to call an additional witness.

01:43:20.562 --> 01:43:23.129
I have already ruled.

01:43:23.131 --> 01:43:25.631
<i>The foreigner is making a
mockery of the People's Court.</i>

01:43:25.633 --> 01:43:28.801
Presiding Chairman,
I implore you!

01:43:28.803 --> 01:43:31.137
I recognize that I have tried
the court's patience.

01:43:31.139 --> 01:43:33.439
I promise you
it will not happen again.

01:43:35.543 --> 01:43:39.178
This witness is in a position
to have unique knowledge

01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:41.461
of the proceedings
of this case.

01:43:43.418 --> 01:43:45.318
Not to call him

01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:48.087
would call into question the
proceedings of this case altogether.

01:43:48.856 --> 01:43:50.556
Please.

01:43:50.558 --> 01:43:53.326
Presiding Chairman,
please, just one more witness.

01:43:53.861 --> 01:43:55.261
Request denied.

01:43:55.263 --> 01:43:57.947
Presiding Chairman,

01:43:57.948 --> 01:44:01.348
the Procurator General has given his
permission to call another witness.

01:44:03.671 --> 01:44:06.991
Presiding Chairman, I would
like to call Minister...

01:44:15.183 --> 01:44:19.518
Presiding Chairman,
I would like to call Lin Dan.

01:44:20.922 --> 01:44:23.203
<i>There is no foundation</i>
<i>for this witness.</i>

01:44:26.894 --> 01:44:29.128
<i>Lin Dan, please take</i>
<i>the witness stand.</i>

01:44:52.754 --> 01:44:55.154
<i>You made use of the
criminal code I gave you.</i>

01:44:55.156 --> 01:44:57.623
Speak English. I know you can.

01:44:59.627 --> 01:45:02.728
Congratulations
on your recent appointment

01:45:02.730 --> 01:45:05.564
as principal Chinese
programming partner

01:45:05.566 --> 01:45:08.934
for HoffCo Telekomm's joint venture
with the Chinese government.

01:45:08.936 --> 01:45:10.269
Thank you.

01:45:10.271 --> 01:45:11.604
Wonderful opportunity.

01:45:11.606 --> 01:45:12.805
Yes.

01:45:12.807 --> 01:45:14.840
Would it be accurate to say

01:45:14.842 --> 01:45:18.411
that my own company,
McAndrews Communications

01:45:18.413 --> 01:45:20.980
was HoffCo Telekomm's
principal competitor

01:45:20.982 --> 01:45:22.481
for that recently
awarded contract?

01:45:22.483 --> 01:45:23.649
I suppose so.

01:45:23.651 --> 01:45:26.118
You suppose so. Okay.

01:45:26.119 --> 01:45:28.586
Would it also be accurate to
say that you had no guarantee

01:45:28.589 --> 01:45:32.958
of an equivalent payoff
from McAndrews?

01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:35.961
<i>Presiding Chairman, "Payoff"
has negative connotation.</i>

01:45:35.963 --> 01:45:38.331
Let me rephrase.

01:45:38.333 --> 01:45:42.201
McAndrews Communications did not
offer you an equivalent position.

01:45:42.203 --> 01:45:44.437
That had not been discussed.

01:45:44.439 --> 01:45:46.305
This has nothing to do
with Hong Ling's murder.

01:45:46.307 --> 01:45:49.108
It has everything to do
with Hong Ling's murder.

01:45:49.110 --> 01:45:50.976
Would you say my indictment

01:45:50.978 --> 01:45:54.447
was responsible for McAndrews
Communications losing that deal?

01:45:54.449 --> 01:45:55.948
<i>Why does the court permit this?</i>

01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:59.118
You used her.
And you sacrificed her.

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:01.954
To sabotage the deal your father
was completing with McAndrews.

01:46:01.956 --> 01:46:03.456
With whom he had
a long personal relationship.

01:46:03.458 --> 01:46:04.790
It could've left you
in the cold.

01:46:04.792 --> 01:46:06.959
These are not questions.

01:46:06.961 --> 01:46:08.627
But this is.

01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:11.630
What was the nature of your
relationship with Hong Ling?

01:46:11.632 --> 01:46:13.466
I had no relationship
with Hong Ling.

01:46:13.468 --> 01:46:14.734
None at all?

01:46:16.371 --> 01:46:18.637
Would you like to reconsider
that statement?

01:46:18.639 --> 01:46:23.075
I knew her, I knew of her family,
but there was no relationship.

01:46:23.077 --> 01:46:25.878
"No relationship."
How do you explain this?

01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:31.751
This is Hong Ling's locket.

01:46:31.753 --> 01:46:35.321
She wore it the night of the murder.
It just turned up.

01:46:40.495 --> 01:46:44.563
Inside is a picture
of General Hong.

01:46:46.534 --> 01:46:48.434
Inside of that,

01:46:48.436 --> 01:46:51.370
there is a charming photograph

01:46:51.372 --> 01:46:57.042
of Hong Ling and... you.

01:46:57.044 --> 01:46:59.912
Accused Moore,
let me see this evidence.

01:47:05.586 --> 01:47:07.787
Please share that
with the People's Assessors.

01:47:07.789 --> 01:47:09.789
They seem
a little more interested now.

01:47:11.359 --> 01:47:14.326
Also, Procurator Ma.
You're not smiling so much.

01:47:16.764 --> 01:47:19.965
Why would there be a photograph of
you and Hong Ling inside her locket?

01:47:19.967 --> 01:47:21.434
There was no relationship.

01:47:22.603 --> 01:47:25.037
I knew her the way
many men knew her.

01:47:25.039 --> 01:47:26.205
The way you knew her.

01:47:26.207 --> 01:47:28.240
But you did know her?

01:47:28.242 --> 01:47:30.876
Answer me.
I knew her a long time ago.

01:47:30.878 --> 01:47:34.814
I had not talked to her

01:47:34.816 --> 01:47:37.383
since I can't remember when.

01:47:37.385 --> 01:47:38.617
"Can't remember when"?

01:47:38.619 --> 01:47:41.987
Will you enter the phone
records into evidence, please?

01:47:41.989 --> 01:47:43.889
On the night Hong Ling
was killed

01:47:43.891 --> 01:47:46.225
three calls were made
from this number

01:47:46.227 --> 01:47:47.927
and two calls were received.

01:47:47.929 --> 01:47:50.079
<i>Objection!</i>

01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:52.230
The first call received was from
Hong Ling early that night.

01:47:52.233 --> 01:47:54.333
Then later, around 2:00 a.m.,

01:47:54.335 --> 01:47:57.670
a call was made for a number
registered to Huan Minglu.

01:47:57.672 --> 01:47:59.104
<i>You're out of order.</i>

01:47:59.106 --> 01:48:02.842
At 3:10 a.m., the second call
made was to a number registered

01:48:02.844 --> 01:48:05.845
to Hong Ling. <i> What do
these telephone numbers...</i>

01:48:05.847 --> 01:48:10.316
At 5:41 a.m., a call was apparently
received from Huan Minglu.

01:48:10.318 --> 01:48:12.184
At 5:46 a.m.,

01:48:12.186 --> 01:48:16.956
a two-minute call was made from
this number to police headquarters.

01:48:16.958 --> 01:48:20.759
<i>Presiding Chairman, this is chaos.
I will have you removed.</i>

01:48:20.761 --> 01:48:23.429
Do you own a cellular telephone?
Yes or no?

01:48:23.431 --> 01:48:24.597
I do.

01:48:24.599 --> 01:48:27.099
What is the number
of that phone?

01:48:27.101 --> 01:48:31.470
I am not a secretary, I rarely call
myself, so I would need to check it.

01:48:31.472 --> 01:48:35.841
Is the number
of your cell phone 517857?

01:48:35.843 --> 01:48:38.060
No, it is not.

01:48:38.061 --> 01:48:40.278
You're quite sure, even though
you rarely call yourself?

01:48:40.281 --> 01:48:42.248
Yes, I am quite sure.

01:48:43.985 --> 01:48:48.454
Who do you think has that number?
517857?

01:48:53.494 --> 01:48:57.029
Is the telephone number yours,
Minister Lin Shou?

01:49:04.472 --> 01:49:05.871
It is my number.

01:49:11.846 --> 01:49:13.212
<i>Don't, Father.</i>

01:49:14.382 --> 01:49:17.216
<i>Don't what? I'm not afraid.</i>

01:49:17.818 --> 01:49:19.518
<i>Why are you afraid?</i>

01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:23.022
You used your father's phone 'cause
you knew the records of an official

01:49:23.024 --> 01:49:26.225
can be withheld. Hong Ling
was supposed to set me up.

01:49:27.828 --> 01:49:30.829
Whatever it was,
she changed her mind.

01:49:30.831 --> 01:49:33.832
Then someone got in there and
drugged me with chloroform.

01:49:35.336 --> 01:49:37.336
Isn't that what happened?

01:49:37.338 --> 01:49:40.839
Was it Huan Minglu?

01:49:40.841 --> 01:49:44.009
Such speculation
is out of order.

01:49:44.011 --> 01:49:45.411
She resisted!

01:49:47.848 --> 01:49:49.081
She ended up dead!

01:49:53.521 --> 01:49:55.854
He killed her, didn't he?

01:49:55.856 --> 01:49:57.923
She got killed,
and I got set up!

01:50:00.094 --> 01:50:02.127
I wasn't there. Ask him.

01:50:05.433 --> 01:50:06.765
What did he just say?

01:50:09.704 --> 01:50:12.938
That's what Hong Ling said
that night, over and over.

01:50:20.214 --> 01:50:22.247
He is saying <i> da guar.</i>

01:50:22.249 --> 01:50:25.985
Hong Ling said, <i> "Da guar,</i>
<i>women de guanxi wan la."</i>

01:50:25.987 --> 01:50:30.389
It means "big shot," like a minister
or an important business person.

01:50:30.391 --> 01:50:32.725
"Big shot, our deal is off."

01:50:32.727 --> 01:50:34.126
Or maybe...

01:50:36.464 --> 01:50:38.230
"Our relationship is over."

01:50:40.434 --> 01:50:43.135
Are you known
to your friends as <i> Da Guar?</i>

01:50:51.579 --> 01:50:52.945
<i>The court is dismissed.</i>

01:50:52.947 --> 01:50:55.748
Presiding Chairman, I request...
I lost sound again!

01:50:55.750 --> 01:51:00.085
I request this session be reopened
and my client be released!

01:51:01.689 --> 01:51:02.921
He said it again!

01:51:02.923 --> 01:51:05.084
You can't let them
take you out of this room!

01:51:07.962 --> 01:51:10.842
What's he saying? "Huan Minglu's
the killer. Arrest him."

01:51:15.703 --> 01:51:17.002
Did he confess?

01:51:17.004 --> 01:51:20.406
He just said
it was all Lin Dan's idea!

01:51:26.614 --> 01:51:28.213
Hong Ling was supposed
to drug you.

01:51:28.215 --> 01:51:30.976
Then he would photograph you with
a young girl, embarrass you.

01:51:33.287 --> 01:51:34.987
You must reconvene the court

01:51:34.989 --> 01:51:37.022
and allow my client to be free!

01:51:37.958 --> 01:51:39.692
Arrest Lin Dan!

01:51:39.694 --> 01:51:41.193
Did you hear what I said?

01:52:06.353 --> 01:52:09.793
He said he's sorry he
caused you so much trouble.

01:52:14.995 --> 01:52:19.665
In keeping with the laws of the
People's Republic of China,

01:52:19.667 --> 01:52:24.236
the guilty parties have now
confessed to the crime

01:52:24.238 --> 01:52:29.408
of conspiracy and murder,
namely, the death of Hong Ling.

01:52:29.410 --> 01:52:31.777
<i>The court would particularly</i>
<i>like to thank</i>

01:52:31.779 --> 01:52:36.615
<i>all levels of party and government
leadership involved in this case,</i>

01:52:36.617 --> 01:52:39.918
<i>for their diligence</i>
<i>and professionalism.</i>

01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:42.855
The justice accorded
will be swift

01:52:42.857 --> 01:52:47.860
<i>as it will be fair</i>
<i>and impartial.</i>

01:52:47.862 --> 01:52:52.765
<i>Her tragic murder would not have
been solved had it not been...</i>

01:52:54.435 --> 01:52:55.768
Mr. Moore.

01:53:06.914 --> 01:53:08.447
We never had any doubt.

01:53:08.449 --> 01:53:11.283
We were always there for you
behind the scenes.

01:53:12.453 --> 01:53:14.820
You really believe
this shit, don't you?

01:53:15.790 --> 01:53:17.289
What did you say?

01:53:17.291 --> 01:53:19.057
I said, "Go to hell."

01:53:23.097 --> 01:53:26.131
I have to take my
grandmother to the country.

01:53:27.234 --> 01:53:29.368
You should see me.
I love to be there.

01:53:29.904 --> 01:53:31.370
I'll miss you.

01:53:36.844 --> 01:53:40.479
There are so many beautiful
and remarkable things here.

01:53:40.915 --> 01:53:42.881
Yes. I know.

01:53:46.654 --> 01:53:50.689
When I was a child, I would
come to this park and play.

01:53:53.861 --> 01:53:56.181
Do you know why
the bamboo is here?

01:53:57.498 --> 01:54:00.199
It is waiting
for the wind to touch it.

01:54:01.602 --> 01:54:03.202
It is filled with emotions.

01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:08.707
Listen to the sounds,
and you can feel them.

01:54:22.523 --> 01:54:23.889
Come with me.

01:54:25.192 --> 01:54:26.692
You know I cannot.

01:54:30.865 --> 01:54:34.600
Change your mind.
I know you can. I've seen it.

01:54:36.971 --> 01:54:40.606
For now, especially now,
I must stay here.

01:54:41.408 --> 01:54:43.528
I am needed to make it better.

01:54:44.144 --> 01:54:45.444
You understand.

01:54:47.381 --> 01:54:51.617
So, do we just
say good-bye now,

01:54:54.388 --> 01:54:56.455
like nothing has happened?

01:54:57.157 --> 01:54:58.223
No.

01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:01.226
Something did happen.

01:55:02.997 --> 01:55:05.163
My life has changed.

01:55:05.933 --> 01:55:08.400
You have opened up.

01:55:12.039 --> 01:55:15.240
You are a part
of my life now, Jack Moore.

01:55:18.746 --> 01:55:20.445
I'll never be the same.

01:55:21.849 --> 01:55:23.548
Neither will I.

01:55:23.550 --> 01:55:26.818
I hope I'm a part
of your life now.

01:55:30.190 --> 01:55:31.623
Wherever we are.

01:55:33.527 --> 01:55:34.760
Wherever we are.

01:55:56.884 --> 01:55:58.150
You should go.

01:55:58.452 --> 01:55:59.685
Yeah.

01:56:34.621 --> 01:56:39.591
Remember, everything
is different now.

01:56:39.593 --> 01:56:44.830
Now you have someone on the other
side of the world who is family.

01:56:48.535 --> 01:56:50.535
You will always have a family.
