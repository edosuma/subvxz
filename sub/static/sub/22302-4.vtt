05:25.742 --> 05:29.662
They're all supposed to be the same size.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.335
Are you ready?

05:36.419 --> 05:38.421
Do you want to make the tortillas, too?
Or just the masa balls?

05:38.504 --> 05:40.006
-Tortillas.
-Yeah?

05:40.089 --> 05:41.090
Yeah.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.009
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.056
Like this.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.892
Yes, Dad, I know!

05:50.975 --> 05:53.352
That's right.
Smash it down.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.396
Not too hard, otherwise...

06:06.866 --> 06:08.659
Put that here.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.706
Put your hand here.

06:18.252 --> 06:19.545
It broke.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.632
Again.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.116
It tastes like cumin.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.659
Because that's what was left
in the molcajete.

09:36.742 --> 09:37.868
But it's good.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.996
That's the secret recipe...

09:40.079 --> 09:43.416
Whatever is left over in the molcajete
from the last time you used it.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.205
One with egg and one with nopal.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.625
Can you please give me a beer
and a campechano taco?

11:36.153 --> 11:37.363
Pass it.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.824
It's good.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.540
It's good.

12:01.470 --> 12:03.222
-Good?
-Yeah.

12:03.305 --> 12:06.600
Thanks to those spices
that were left over in the molcajete.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.049
Go get your backpacks.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.634
-What?
-No!

21:42.718 --> 21:45.512
Yes.
And go put on your shoes.

21:48.265 --> 21:52.436
People are going to think
you don't like going to school.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.771
But that is actually true.

26:11.778 --> 26:14.322
Which spices do we have in the pantry?

26:14.406 --> 26:19.953
We have cinnamon,
star anise, cumin, allspice...

26:20.036 --> 26:21.329
We have star anise?

26:21.413 --> 26:24.291
-Let's throw a couple of those in.
-Yes, Chef.

26:24.374 --> 26:26.293
-So it'll be less traditional.
-Yes, Chef.

28:42.220 --> 28:47.267
<i>Here is the beginning</i>
<i>of the production of the Ensamble,</i>

28:47.350 --> 28:50.061
which is a blend of six different agaves.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.397
It was designed thinking of the origin.

28:53.231 --> 28:55.316
<i>How do you come up with the blends?</i>

28:55.400 --> 28:58.486
<i>One way is separating by species,</i>
<i>by variety.</i>

28:58.570 --> 29:02.157
<i>The other is selecting</i>
<i>a specific land area,</i>

29:02.240 --> 29:04.117
<i>and processing all mature agaves on it.</i>

29:04.200 --> 29:07.454
<i>So you mix varieties, but they</i>
<i>are linked by a common land.</i>

29:07.537 --> 29:09.789
<i>They all grew in the same place.</i>

31:00.149 --> 31:03.736
<i>Agave plants take</i>
<i>about 12 to 15 years to mature.</i>

31:03.820 --> 31:06.406
<i>At that point you can cut the plant,</i>

31:06.489 --> 31:09.659
<i>process it and bring it here</i>
<i>to transform it into mezcal.</i>

31:12.287 --> 31:15.748
-Time makes wonders.
-Yes.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.125
It makes us old.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.503
I'd rather be old than a dumbass.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.670
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hello.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.173
<i>-Hi, love.</i>
-Hi, sweetie.

32:05.256 --> 32:06.674
<i>What's up?</i>
<i>Aldo wants to say hello.</i>

32:06.758 --> 32:08.468
Okay, put him on the phone.

32:09.469 --> 32:10.637
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

32:10.720 --> 32:14.015
Hi, love.
Did you get a stomachache?

32:14.098 --> 32:16.351
<i>-Yes.</i>
-What did you eat?

32:16.434 --> 32:17.810
<i>Two lemonades.</i>

32:17.894 --> 32:20.104
And how is your brother?

32:20.188 --> 32:21.814
<i>-What?</i>
-Your brother.

32:23.024 --> 32:26.569
-Is your brother feeling better or not?
<i>-He is better.</i>

32:26.653 --> 32:30.073
Okay, kisses.
Put Mom on the phone.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.325
<i>What?</i>

32:32.408 --> 32:35.286
I said "kisses" and please
put Mom on the phone.

32:36.663 --> 32:38.831
-Thank you.
<i>-What happened?</i>

32:38.915 --> 32:40.708
Nothing.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.544
Is he better?
Do you think it was the medicine?

32:43.628 --> 32:44.671
<i>Excuse me?</i>

32:44.754 --> 32:48.132
Do you think the medicine
gave him the stomachache?

32:48.216 --> 32:50.593
<i>Are you in the kitchen?</i>
<i>Because I can't hear you.</i>

32:50.677 --> 32:52.804
No, I am outside.

33:44.731 --> 33:47.400
My man.
You're late.

33:47.483 --> 33:49.527
Traffic was bad.

33:49.610 --> 33:52.155
I thought
you were doing shots of mezcal.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.027
Can you handle it?

44:14.026 --> 44:16.111
There is a big rumor going around, man.

44:17.237 --> 44:19.490
Do you have a date?
