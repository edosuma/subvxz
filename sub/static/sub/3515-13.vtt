Your child is very active.

00:04.440 --> 00:06.408

attack to two other scalpings.

You're friends with a Grimm?

01:33.440 --> 01:35.568
Yes.
I am so sorry.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.641
I really didn't want to hit you.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.764

just try to kill me.

I can explain.

And you let him into your house.

Did you not hear what I just said?
Nick is a friend.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.361
(SCOFFS) First he's
engaged to a Fuchsbau,

02:00.400 --> 02:03.051
That is not happening.
Not in my house.

02:03.160 --> 02:06.130
Well, maybe your Grimm friend
would like to take it outside.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.008
No, he would not like
to take it outside,

02:08.080 --> 02:10.287
because he'll kill you, okay?

02:10.400 --> 02:12.402
I've seen it happen.
I've seen him do it.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.961
You've hunted with a Grimm?

02:15.360 --> 02:17.283
He's a cop.
I mean, I just...

02:17.360 --> 02:18.850

that's not true.

on Monroe too much.

would have stopped a long time ago.

This isn't about that.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.480
Maybe you're right.

But I should stop asking
him for help for a while.

to talk to him about?

any contact with Adalind?

No, we don't.

Pech were working together.

is getting her powers back.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.165
NICK: I hope those

13:18.240 --> 13:21.687
No. After having delightful
nightmares about being scalped,

13:21.760 --> 13:23.125
I thought I would
find out as much

13:23.200 --> 13:24.560
as I could about
why somebody would

13:24.600 --> 13:26.523
want to do this to me
while I was sleeping.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.241
You interested?

13:28.560 --> 13:29.561
What have you got?
Okay.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.166
This dates back
to the Scythians.

13:32.240 --> 13:35.369
That's like 44 BC.
The Scythians would hang

13:35.440 --> 13:37.204
their victims' scalps
from their bridles.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.009
Apparently, they were
very proud of them.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.526
The more they had, the bigger and
badder they supposedly were.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.171
There are a ton of
historical references,

13:44.240 --> 13:46.846
like the Sachsenspiegel,
which was the most important

13:46.920 --> 13:48.843
law book of the Germanic
Middle Ages.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.809
The book said that
the men who were convicted

13:50.880 --> 13:53.008
of the most heinous crimes
were sentenced

13:53.080 --> 13:55.401
to have their heads scalped
because hair was considered

13:55.520 --> 13:57.090
a mystical symbol
of the free man.

13:57.560 --> 13:59.210
Anyway, the gist of all this is,

13:59.280 --> 14:01.647
the more scalps you have, the
more power you've extracted

14:01.720 --> 14:03.000
from your enemies
and the fiercer

14:03.040 --> 14:04.280
you therefore were
on the battlefield.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.562

14:07.080 --> 14:08.491

14:08.560 --> 14:10.085

14:10.200 --> 14:12.521
is using these scalps
to make a cloak.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.400

36:20.160 --> 36:21.525
How about the quarry?

36:21.600 --> 36:23.762
Plenty of open ground.
Should work.

36:23.840 --> 36:25.126
Let's go.
(WIND HOWLING)

36:26.680 --> 36:28.125
(THUNDER CRACKLING)

36:56.280 --> 36:58.760
Okay, so...

36:59.240 --> 37:00.685
My book could have been wrong.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.325
(THUNDER CRACKLING)
(SHOUTING)

37:02.640 --> 37:03.641
(GASPS)

37:07.840 --> 37:09.490
(GRUNTING)

37:20.320 --> 37:21.321
Behind you!

37:24.120 --> 37:25.326
(GRUNTS)

37:26.200 --> 37:28.328
(BOTH GROWLING)

37:28.920 --> 37:30.126
(GRUNTING)

37:30.840 --> 37:32.171
(GROWLING)

37:52.360 --> 37:54.203
What do we do now?
Get to their hair.

37:54.280 --> 37:56.521
Easier said than...
(SCREAMING) (GROWLING)

38:01.360 --> 38:02.361
Come on!

38:03.080 --> 38:04.081
Damn it!

38:04.600 --> 38:05.965
(GRUNTING)

38:10.200 --> 38:11.201
MONROE: I'll take
the one on the right.

38:11.280 --> 38:12.680
NICK: I'll take
the one on the left.

38:15.880 --> 38:17.689
What about the really
big guy in the middle?

38:18.040 --> 38:19.405
(GROWLING)

38:34.840 --> 38:36.171
Get off my son!

38:36.240 --> 38:37.571
(GROWLING)

39:16.040 --> 39:17.041
Dad.

39:17.320 --> 39:18.845
(GROWLING)

39:23.200 --> 39:24.440
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

39:26.880 --> 39:28.848
You didn't know what
you were up against.

39:30.440 --> 39:32.283
If I... Even if you
are friends with a Grimm,

39:32.360 --> 39:34.010
I couldn't see you die.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.805
How did you know
how to kill them?

39:36.920 --> 39:37.967
We didn't.

39:38.600 --> 39:40.329
Nick's ancestors did.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.930
I didn't think it was possible

39:43.280 --> 39:45.203
to fight on the same side
as a Grimm.

39:45.320 --> 39:47.641
I told you, he's different.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.923
Some things you have
to see for yourself.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.928
All my life, I've heard
about these guys.

39:54.640 --> 39:58.247
Your great grandfather,
whenever it would storm,

40:00.000 --> 40:01.206
he'd get scared.

40:01.760 --> 40:04.809
He told us kids, if the
Wildesheers ever came back,

40:06.280 --> 40:09.523
it meant something really
bad was going to come next.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.404
MONROE: How "really bad"?

40:12.520 --> 40:14.090
I don't know.

40:15.240 --> 40:18.244
Just something, somewhere,
was going to happen

40:18.320 --> 40:19.810
that would change the world.

40:20.600 --> 40:22.045
(THUNDER CRACKLING)

40:41.800 --> 40:43.404
Thank you.

40:43.520 --> 40:44.806
MAN: Any more food?

40:44.960 --> 40:47.770
No. It was good, though.

40:49.200 --> 40:50.565
(SIGHS)

40:56.440 --> 40:57.851
(GASPS) Ahh!

40:58.120 --> 40:59.610
(PANTING)

41:00.160 --> 41:01.446
Oh, God.
What?

41:02.160 --> 41:03.889
I think it's coming.

41:04.160 --> 41:05.491
(SCREAMING)

41:15.960 --> 41:17.440
JULIETTE: Can I have
the peas, please?

41:33.960 --> 41:36.964
Well, this wedding stuff
is pretty exciting, huh?

41:37.400 --> 41:38.845
Have you guys set a date yet?

41:42.080 --> 41:43.241
(SNARLS)

41:48.760 --> 41:49.966
What?

41:50.040 --> 41:51.644
Everybody just calm down.

41:51.800 --> 41:52.801
Okay?

42:04.920 --> 42:06.126
(SIGHS)

42:06.760 --> 42:07.807
Sorry.

42:09.440 --> 42:13.286
This is just gonna take
a little getting used to.
