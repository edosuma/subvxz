WEBVTT

00:15.222 --> 00:16.680
Got
another Christmas card.

00:16.722 --> 00:18.055
Hmm.

00:24.430 --> 00:25.846
I missed you.

00:25.888 --> 00:27.096
Yeah, you missed the money.

00:27.138 --> 00:29.180
Aww, a little bit of both.

00:29.222 --> 00:30.263
Don't you want me?

00:32.763 --> 00:33.930
I want you

00:33.972 --> 00:35.888
to take a fucking shower.

00:42.097 --> 00:43.556
Hey.

00:43.598 --> 00:45.514
I said go fucking take a shower,

00:45.556 --> 00:47.598
I didn't say go answer
the fucking door.

00:48.888 --> 00:53.888
Go on. Faith. Get up and
take a fucking shower.

00:58.680 --> 01:03.472
A little fucking late
to come to the fucking door.

01:03.514 --> 01:04.556
Huh?

01:04.598 --> 01:06.556
Don't come to my fucking door.

01:09.263 --> 01:10.346
What the fuck?

01:19.763 --> 01:21.221
Breaking
news just in,

01:21.263 --> 01:22.430
about the highly anticipated

01:22.472 --> 01:23.763
biopic "Laughter in the Dark",

01:23.805 --> 01:27.721
featuring the tragic death of
the beloved comedian Ray Kelly.

01:27.763 --> 01:31.096
Joe Johnson has been set to
star in the film this Autumn.

01:31.138 --> 01:32.596
And of course Ray
Kelly is the winner

01:32.638 --> 01:34.514
of multiple Perrier
comedy awards.

01:34.556 --> 01:37.096
And has made many film
appearances himself.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.763
Joe Johnson's manager and
agent, husband and wife team,

01:39.805 --> 01:41.138
say that they are thrilled

01:41.180 --> 01:42.971
that Joe's been cast in a movie,

01:43.013 --> 01:44.431
and they think
that he will astound

01:44.473 --> 01:45.971
audiences with his...

01:57.097 --> 01:58.180
How's that again?

02:21.847 --> 02:24.805
And please, come and see me
in the Ray Kelly movie.

02:24.847 --> 02:25.680
They go Yawwww.

02:44.138 --> 02:45.097
Honk! Honk!

02:50.431 --> 02:53.055
This Ray Kelly movie
is going to be epic

03:02.555 --> 03:05.096
It is one of
London's most notorious

03:05.138 --> 03:07.971
unsolved murders,
and are you recording?

03:08.013 --> 03:09.180
Uh, yes.

03:09.222 --> 03:10.305
Great.

03:10.347 --> 03:12.555
Ray and his wife were found
murdered in their home

03:12.597 --> 03:13.846
seemingly without motive.

03:13.888 --> 03:16.097
Catherine, Catherine,
we need more face!

03:17.473 --> 03:19.180
But this film will
focus on his life

03:19.222 --> 03:22.221
and how he evolved
his stand up comedy.

03:22.263 --> 03:23.389
Uh Joe sorry,

03:23.431 --> 03:24.680
- Uh, Joe?
- Yes Goldilocks?

03:24.722 --> 03:26.389
Is there anything
you'd like to say?

03:26.431 --> 03:28.513
I feel very honored,
and privileged,

03:28.555 --> 03:31.680
excited about playing the
greatest comic that ever lived.

03:31.722 --> 03:33.555
I just hope the film isn't shit.

03:33.597 --> 03:34.888
Well can you act?

03:34.930 --> 03:35.596
Good one!

03:35.638 --> 03:36.721
Oh I'm sorry.

03:36.763 --> 03:38.055
No, Joe, Joe?

03:38.972 --> 03:40.347
Ladies and gentlemen

03:40.389 --> 03:41.555
please welcome Joe Johnson.

03:48.180 --> 03:49.471
Thank you very much
ladies and gentlemen

03:49.513 --> 03:51.596
and please come and see
me in the Ray Kelly movie,

03:51.638 --> 03:53.221
it's going to be epic.

03:57.263 --> 03:59.846
Knock,
knock!

03:59.888 --> 04:01.096
Knock, knock!

04:02.597 --> 04:04.096
A bit late for a
Heckle my friend.

04:05.805 --> 04:06.888
Was it a knock, knock joke?

04:06.930 --> 04:08.013
Is that what you're doing?

04:08.722 --> 04:10.180
You know, I mean, these gags

04:10.222 --> 04:11.930
I've thought long
and hard about.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.348
All I'm saying is
it better be good.

04:17.348 --> 04:18.389
Oh.

04:18.430 --> 04:19.805
Who's there?

04:19.847 --> 04:21.846
Knock, knock.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.306
All right.

04:26.222 --> 04:27.930
This is going to be exciting.

04:27.972 --> 04:31.138
You know what the difference
is between you and me?

04:31.180 --> 04:33.846
It's that you paid what?

04:33.888 --> 04:38.930
15, 20 pounds to come and
see me performing tonight.

04:39.805 --> 04:41.846
Where as I only paid

04:41.888 --> 04:44.055
1 pound,
50 to fuck your mom last night

04:44.097 --> 04:44.971
and she was shit.

04:47.222 --> 04:48.971
My mother is dead.

04:49.013 --> 04:50.930
Well that explains why
she wouldn't get on top.

04:51.763 --> 04:52.638
Fuck me, was she dry.

04:53.597 --> 04:56.763
It was like sharpening
a bloody pencil.

04:56.805 --> 04:58.471
Hey they love us!

04:58.513 --> 05:00.430
We could be a double act.

05:00.472 --> 05:01.388
What do you say?

05:01.430 --> 05:03.013
I think you need to
look up the definition

05:03.055 --> 05:05.138
of Heckling, you're not
holding your end up.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.388
Seriously?

05:06.430 --> 05:09.222
You thought you could
come here to Heckle me?

05:11.972 --> 05:14.013
You heckle me?

05:15.555 --> 05:17.055
At my show!

05:17.472 --> 05:19.180
This is my show!

05:19.222 --> 05:21.846
I own this fucking stage, bitch!

05:21.888 --> 05:22.846
And I own you!

05:22.888 --> 05:24.180
I own you!

05:24.222 --> 05:25.596
You're afraid.

05:25.638 --> 05:27.347
I am?

05:27.388 --> 05:29.596
Late at night
you know you are!

05:29.638 --> 05:31.264
In your bones.

05:32.722 --> 05:34.138
This guy!

05:35.055 --> 05:37.013
Where are you from my friend?

05:37.055 --> 05:38.013
Hell.

05:40.597 --> 05:41.597
Oh.

05:42.805 --> 05:44.055
Scary.

05:46.138 --> 05:47.596
Are you the boogie man?

05:47.638 --> 05:49.555
Much worse.

05:49.597 --> 05:52.223
You got a name,
Creep heckler guy?

05:53.264 --> 05:54.722
You don't wanna know.

06:00.097 --> 06:03.055
Well this has been interesting

06:03.472 --> 06:04.596
I wish you all the best with

06:04.638 --> 06:06.222
your career as a serial killer.

06:07.097 --> 06:08.222
Thank you very much.

06:08.264 --> 06:09.596
Goodnight!

06:33.097 --> 06:33.638
Boo!

06:35.013 --> 06:36.346
Tag's easier, right?

06:48.930 --> 06:50.430
Uh, I can't believe this.

06:50.472 --> 06:52.263
Making me work
on my day off,

06:52.305 --> 06:53.888
'I don't wanna find it', oh.

06:54.430 --> 06:56.888
It's impossible to find
anything in this...

06:56.930 --> 06:59.055
Look at this,
what have they done?

07:00.763 --> 07:01.596
Is that it?

07:01.638 --> 07:03.596
That's not it,
what's it doing here?

07:03.638 --> 07:06.013
I hope they haven't been
cleaning their tools here,

07:06.055 --> 07:07.139
this is it though.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.805
What do you want?

07:11.847 --> 07:13.055
You are in the wrong place man,

07:13.097 --> 07:14.263
can't you see I'm busy?

07:14.305 --> 07:15.971
You deaf or something?
What's the matter with you?

07:16.013 --> 07:17.680
The toilets are down
to the right okay?

07:17.722 --> 07:19.013
Wardrobe, makeup, everything.

07:19.055 --> 07:20.680
Now on you go, bye then.

07:23.388 --> 07:24.846
What's that silly
mask you've got?

07:24.888 --> 07:26.597
You look like Rudolph
the red nose reindeer.

07:27.638 --> 07:29.097
It's all right mate, it's okay.

07:29.139 --> 07:30.888
Where is Joe?

07:31.305 --> 07:33.805
Joe? What do you want Joe for?

07:33.847 --> 07:35.971
He's got no time for you or me.

07:42.388 --> 07:44.722
Help somebody! Help me!

08:16.805 --> 08:19.805
Oh, like attracts
like doesn't it?

08:20.388 --> 08:21.139
Thanks.

08:21.430 --> 08:22.972
I propose a toast, Joe.

08:23.472 --> 08:25.305
To my good friend...

08:26.430 --> 08:28.097
To your outrageous success

08:28.139 --> 08:30.014
in landing this
role of Ray Kelly.

08:30.056 --> 08:31.763
We all know
that you're the one

08:31.805 --> 08:34.056
who wanted to be
the famous comedian.

08:35.222 --> 08:36.098
Catherine!

08:37.180 --> 08:41.056
Evelyn. You didn't make
eye contact, darling.

08:41.847 --> 08:44.388
A toast without eye
contact doesn't count.

08:44.638 --> 08:46.430
Oh okay.

08:48.930 --> 08:52.346
Oh, my friend has a place
in the country, she's away.

08:52.388 --> 08:53.555
We can all go.

08:53.597 --> 08:56.388
Yeah we could do
like a Halloween party.

08:56.430 --> 08:57.388
Oh my God!

08:57.430 --> 08:59.097
Yes! I love this idea.

09:00.555 --> 09:05.056
What if we make it a
fancy dress theme, 80's?

09:05.098 --> 09:06.263
Oh no. No.

09:06.972 --> 09:08.721
David, you can
dust off your shell serve,

09:08.763 --> 09:10.388
when did you have it last out?
Last week?

09:10.430 --> 09:12.430
No, no, no,
Lucie's coming to stay Joe.

09:12.472 --> 09:15.056
Why not? You said
she's a big fan of mine.

09:15.098 --> 09:16.097
It'd be a big surprise.

09:16.138 --> 09:18.972
We should leave our
phones and iPads at home.

09:19.014 --> 09:20.221
Make it a real break.

09:20.263 --> 09:21.388
We should make a rule.

09:21.430 --> 09:22.721
If it wasn't there in the 80's,

09:22.763 --> 09:24.388
then it shouldn't be there.

09:24.430 --> 09:27.263
Ahh, mobile phones come
out in 1983 darling.

09:28.555 --> 09:30.388
Well this party is set in 82.

09:30.430 --> 09:32.097
Oh we should get a VCR player.

09:32.138 --> 09:34.180
You are in
that Ray Kelly movie.

09:34.222 --> 09:35.680
Yes I am.

09:36.722 --> 09:38.763
Ray Kelly used to come
in here all the time.

09:38.805 --> 09:40.263
- No, really?
- Yeah!

09:40.305 --> 09:41.430
What was he like?

09:41.472 --> 09:46.138
He was very different
to uh, what you saw on TV.

09:52.014 --> 09:53.931
Excuse me, we're closing now.

09:53.973 --> 09:55.972
Yeah,
I'm not done reading my article.

09:56.014 --> 09:57.680
I'm sorry, it's eleven sir

09:57.722 --> 09:59.638
And what happens if I stay?

09:59.680 --> 10:00.638
You can't.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.305
Shh.
Just shut the fuck up. Okay.

10:02.347 --> 10:04.014
You be a good girl,
and shut the fuck up.

10:04.056 --> 10:06.180
Okay, I'm going to fucking
leave when I'm ready.

10:06.222 --> 10:07.596
Okay, I'm a fucking customer.

10:07.638 --> 10:08.680
You see me pay!

10:08.722 --> 10:10.263
Huh?

10:10.305 --> 10:11.805
Holy fuck toots.

10:11.847 --> 10:14.096
You've got a fucking
pair of eyes on you.

10:14.138 --> 10:15.263
Huh. You've got a boyfriend?

10:15.305 --> 10:18.180
Huh?
Speak, speak, just don't speak.

10:18.222 --> 10:19.305
Just stay like that.

10:19.347 --> 10:20.596
And get the fuck outta here.

10:20.638 --> 10:23.430
Skedaddle, toot a loo,
Jesus fucking Christ.

10:23.472 --> 10:25.846
I'm a fucking customer, okay?

10:25.888 --> 10:27.221
Fuck.

10:27.263 --> 10:29.638
Oh,
I'm sure it was just a one off.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.763
Hmm. Yeah right.

10:32.805 --> 10:33.973
Anyway.

10:35.430 --> 10:38.805
So. How did you two meet?

10:38.847 --> 10:41.972
Oh ah. Evelyn came
and watched me perform,

10:42.014 --> 10:45.305
and shamelessly seduced
me in the bar afterwards.

10:45.347 --> 10:47.096
It was that simple.

10:47.138 --> 10:48.096
It always is.

10:48.138 --> 10:49.014
I'm an actress.

10:49.055 --> 10:50.263
They always are.

10:50.305 --> 10:51.138
Darling.

10:51.180 --> 10:53.096
Fuck sake. I'm not drunk.

10:53.138 --> 10:56.680
So when Joe and I were together.

10:56.722 --> 10:57.555
Really?

10:58.555 --> 10:59.931
I didn't know.

10:59.973 --> 11:01.346
Yeah.

11:01.388 --> 11:02.430
Come on darling.

11:02.472 --> 11:04.596
Don't darling me.
Get the fuck off.

11:10.722 --> 11:11.763
David!

11:14.263 --> 11:16.055
Back off, will you!

11:18.763 --> 11:20.889
I'm gonna call an Uber.

11:22.388 --> 11:24.430
It's one of those killer clowns.

11:25.305 --> 11:26.638
Hey! Is that Joe Johnson?

11:28.555 --> 11:29.847
That's funny.

11:45.430 --> 11:46.763
Hello Joe.

11:46.805 --> 11:48.430
Who is this?

11:50.763 --> 11:52.388
How did you get this number?

11:52.430 --> 11:53.763
Don't quite remember.

11:53.805 --> 11:55.055
What do you want?

11:55.097 --> 11:56.430
After humiliating
me last night,

11:56.472 --> 11:59.055
I've realized that I
can make destroying

11:59.097 --> 12:01.305
you my life's mission.

12:01.347 --> 12:06.138
This is crazy. You don't
know me. I'm a total stranger.

12:06.180 --> 12:08.388
You're every person
that ever treated me

12:08.430 --> 12:11.013
like a piece of shit.

12:11.055 --> 12:13.180
And I'm not a piece of shit.

12:13.222 --> 12:15.096
We'll meet in time.

12:15.138 --> 12:16.763
Excuse me?

12:16.805 --> 12:18.721
Just know the
spotlights on you now.

12:18.763 --> 12:21.721
And this heckle will never,
ever stop.

12:21.763 --> 12:24.680
I'll take you to hell.
And heckle you there too.

12:24.722 --> 12:27.096
Dangerous profession of yours.

12:27.138 --> 12:30.305
After all, look what
happened to Ray Kelly.

13:07.930 --> 13:08.806
Hi.

13:08.848 --> 13:10.555
Mum. Is Brianie there?

13:10.597 --> 13:12.764
Yes! Is everything okay?

13:12.806 --> 13:14.180
Fine.

13:14.222 --> 13:15.097
Brianie?

13:15.555 --> 13:16.764
I'm not sure where she is.

13:16.806 --> 13:19.138
But she shouldn't be far.

13:19.180 --> 13:20.055
Brianie?

13:23.680 --> 13:25.097
Well she's not in her room.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.555
That's strange. Brianie?

13:33.555 --> 13:35.305
Is she in the living room?

13:35.347 --> 13:36.597
She's not in here.

13:37.638 --> 13:39.138
I'll go check.

13:39.180 --> 13:40.055
Brianie?

13:41.097 --> 13:41.888
Mum?

13:41.930 --> 13:43.263
No, it's okay, I just.

13:43.305 --> 13:44.764
Brianie!

13:44.806 --> 13:45.764
Brianie?

13:47.138 --> 13:47.888
Mum?

13:49.472 --> 13:51.846
No she's not in here.

13:51.888 --> 13:54.096
Is she in the front room?

13:54.138 --> 13:55.972
I'll go check.

13:56.263 --> 13:57.555
Brianie?

13:57.597 --> 13:58.513
Mum?

13:58.555 --> 13:59.972
Yes I'm just.

14:01.263 --> 14:02.138
Brianie?

14:12.972 --> 14:13.888
Mum?

14:16.055 --> 14:18.222
She's out in the garden.

14:21.472 --> 14:24.263
Your dad.

14:31.263 --> 14:34.388
So I'm going to be
going away for a couple of days.

14:35.263 --> 14:36.638
Where are you going?

14:37.638 --> 14:39.096
I'm just going to
see some friends.

14:39.138 --> 14:41.430
You're going to stay
here with Grandma.

14:44.930 --> 14:46.555
Made you a picture!

14:46.597 --> 14:48.055
Oh, thank you.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.597
Oh.

14:53.555 --> 14:54.430
Thanks.

15:01.638 --> 15:04.221
He'd be proud
you're making a movie.

15:04.263 --> 15:05.138
Yeah.

15:11.097 --> 15:12.513
Just drive carefully.

15:12.555 --> 15:13.430
Okay.

15:13.805 --> 15:15.722
Now, I'll see you Monday.

15:15.763 --> 15:16.722
Yeah?

15:16.763 --> 15:19.513
She'd like to see more
of her Dad, you know.

15:19.555 --> 15:22.221
Well you're always
on tour somewhere.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.639
Just be there for her.

15:24.681 --> 15:26.555
But when you get back

15:26.597 --> 15:28.555
take her to the zoo.

15:29.430 --> 15:30.723
Anything.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.846
She said you never
took her to the zoo.

15:33.888 --> 15:34.805
All right

15:34.847 --> 15:37.346
Now what child hasn't
had that experience?

15:37.388 --> 15:39.013
Mum,
I'll take her to the zoo, okay?

15:39.055 --> 15:40.388
Her mother never sees her.

15:40.430 --> 15:41.971
Laura,
she's just a bit you know.

15:42.013 --> 15:43.888
She's working through stuff.

15:45.388 --> 15:49.597
Love Brianie as
much as she loves you.

15:49.639 --> 15:52.138
How can you say that?
She means everything to me.

15:52.180 --> 15:54.471
I see you
with all these girls

15:54.513 --> 15:57.555
in the papers. Always at parties

15:57.930 --> 16:00.222
Please. Grow up.

16:00.930 --> 16:03.388
If only for Brianie's sake.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.555
You're her hero.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.346
Be one.

16:07.388 --> 16:09.556
I've been sober
for three months.

16:09.598 --> 16:12.097
Sorry, but if I don't say it,
who will?

16:31.555 --> 16:32.930
Hello?

16:32.972 --> 16:34.680
Hello.
Is that Mrs. Johnson?

16:34.722 --> 16:35.763
Yes.

16:35.805 --> 16:37.388
Have you recently been
involved in a car accident?

16:37.430 --> 16:38.763
Not right now.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.180
God.

16:55.222 --> 16:56.763
Sorry.
I didn't mean to make you jump.

16:56.805 --> 16:59.096
It's just the others
are going to be waiting.

16:59.138 --> 17:01.514
Joe.
Luke and Lucie are on the train,

17:01.556 --> 17:02.388
and if we're not there.

17:02.430 --> 17:03.639
I heard you.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.514
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:05.556 --> 17:07.347
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:07.930 --> 17:08.763
Good boy.

18:02.805 --> 18:04.514
Come on. Come on!

18:04.556 --> 18:06.096
All right.

18:06.138 --> 18:08.263
What is this whole thing
about, you know,

18:08.305 --> 18:11.221
Christmas decorations up
before Halloween's even ended.

18:11.263 --> 18:13.388
I mean, what is that?

18:13.430 --> 18:15.263
You know, it's like,

18:15.305 --> 18:17.971
you wouldn't get the police
turn up to a crime scene,

18:18.013 --> 18:19.388
and then just be like,

18:19.430 --> 18:22.055
we got the sense we
were going to call you.

18:24.097 --> 18:26.763
Oh, this guy is going
on and on, isn't he?

18:26.805 --> 18:28.180
Yeah, he's lost it.

18:28.222 --> 18:31.096
I would rather just
go back to the house.

18:31.138 --> 18:31.971
Yeah me too.

18:32.013 --> 18:32.846
But you know,

18:32.888 --> 18:33.721
but we just have to hangout

18:33.763 --> 18:35.096
with these guys.

18:35.138 --> 18:36.013
You crack me up.

18:37.514 --> 18:40.305
Luke got me your
DVD for Christmas.

18:40.347 --> 18:42.597
I'm sure he nicked it.

18:43.013 --> 18:44.346
Evelyn? Is it.

18:44.388 --> 18:45.514
Yeah.

18:45.847 --> 18:48.514
Aww. You're so pretty.

18:49.138 --> 18:51.805
Oh, thanks, I'm an actress.

18:53.847 --> 18:54.721
What?

18:54.763 --> 18:55.805
Oh, come on.

18:55.847 --> 18:57.555
You're a terrible actress.

18:57.597 --> 18:58.846
And you're a terrible person.

18:58.888 --> 18:59.514
Oww.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.055
Oh she got you there mate.

19:01.097 --> 19:02.971
So are you going to
be in that film then?

19:03.013 --> 19:06.346
- Yeah it's Ray Kelly.
- Excuse me.

19:06.388 --> 19:08.096
- Excuse me?
- A comedy biopic...

19:08.138 --> 19:09.472
Excuse me,
are you Joe Johnson?

19:09.514 --> 19:11.431
Yep. Am I under arrest?

19:12.263 --> 19:13.472
I know it's a big ask,

19:13.514 --> 19:15.138
it's just that we have
this little comedy

19:15.180 --> 19:16.346
afternoon here on a Saturday.

19:16.388 --> 19:18.555
And I just wondered if
you'd give us a few jokes.

19:18.597 --> 19:20.221
Oh really.
We've got to be getting off.

19:20.263 --> 19:22.721
Now I won't take
no for an answer.

19:22.763 --> 19:24.680
Please,
you're my favorite comedian.

19:24.722 --> 19:26.346
Um, Kevin's only on for
a couple more minutes.

19:26.388 --> 19:27.596
And to be honest,
he's not that good.

19:27.638 --> 19:28.513
Excuse me love.

19:28.555 --> 19:29.389
It would be
absolutely fine.

19:29.431 --> 19:30.513
Can you tell me
where the loo is?

19:30.555 --> 19:31.472
Oh yeah, it's just,

19:31.513 --> 19:33.055
I'll tell you what,
yeah, come this way.

19:34.722 --> 19:36.431
I think she wants you
to make her wet bro.

19:36.473 --> 19:38.096
Ugh.

19:38.138 --> 19:40.180
I've got to get some nuts.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.805
Haven't eaten a thing all day.

19:44.638 --> 19:46.555
I don't really
care for dogs much.

19:46.597 --> 19:48.305
I prefer pussy!

19:51.888 --> 19:54.555
Tough crowd here tonight, innit?

19:54.597 --> 19:55.473
Hello?

19:57.138 --> 19:59.055
You're a fucking loser,
you know that?

19:59.097 --> 20:01.763
Not in the best mood
again today, are we?

20:01.805 --> 20:04.389
Funny finding you
in such a bad mood.

20:04.431 --> 20:07.013
Yet wearing such
a colorful shirt.

20:07.055 --> 20:08.888
You look like a fucking clown.

20:08.930 --> 20:10.555
That Jeep outside is yours.

20:10.597 --> 20:12.389
I saw you trailing us earlier.

20:14.888 --> 20:16.263
Fucking coward.

20:21.097 --> 20:22.055
Thanks.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.555
Uh, I need my uh,
sunglasses up here.

20:27.680 --> 20:31.221
Uh. As I'm sure some
of you may be aware,

20:31.263 --> 20:35.096
I'm starring in the
new Ray Kelly film,

20:35.972 --> 20:37.263
Laughter in the Dark.

20:37.305 --> 20:39.347
We start shooting on um...

20:39.389 --> 20:41.389
Knock, knock!

20:43.597 --> 20:45.138
Knock, knock!

20:54.763 --> 20:57.055
Sorry, I didn't get
much sleep last night.

21:03.763 --> 21:04.638
Uh,

21:06.680 --> 21:08.846
as I was saying, I um,

21:08.888 --> 21:09.763
I just...

21:14.389 --> 21:15.722
Excuse me.

21:21.138 --> 21:21.930
Hey!

21:21.972 --> 21:22.847
Are you high?

21:32.472 --> 21:34.222
Where the fuck did you go?

21:34.264 --> 21:35.971
To the bathroom.

21:36.013 --> 21:37.013
And the guy?

21:37.055 --> 21:38.638
What guy?

21:38.680 --> 21:40.930
The fucking guy
that grabbed your arm!

21:40.972 --> 21:43.680
What? He was just asking
where the bathroom was.

21:43.722 --> 21:44.680
Let's go.

21:45.888 --> 21:48.306
No hang on. How are Luke
and Lucie going to get there?

21:48.348 --> 21:50.096
They'll get a mini
cab, or a flying saucer,

21:50.138 --> 21:52.055
- or something.
- You can't just...

22:06.972 --> 22:08.555
I like the creepy swing.

22:11.264 --> 22:12.388
Let me see!

22:12.430 --> 22:13.264
That's nothing.

22:13.306 --> 22:14.721
You should see the
creepy basement.

22:14.763 --> 22:15.596
Oh.

22:15.638 --> 22:17.680
And the apple
bobbing is all set up.

22:17.722 --> 22:20.513
No bloody apple bobbing.

22:20.555 --> 22:21.763
How old are we?

22:21.805 --> 22:23.763
Oh spoil sport.

22:23.805 --> 22:25.096
What the hell is that?

22:25.138 --> 22:28.430
Oh that's what us
dinosaurs used to watch

22:28.472 --> 22:30.013
the movies on.

22:30.055 --> 22:31.013
Well it's massive.

22:31.055 --> 22:32.596
Hmm. Like your ass.

22:33.888 --> 22:36.055
Let's watch one
of those video dusties.

22:38.388 --> 22:39.264
What was that?

22:42.472 --> 22:44.055
I ain't falling for it Luce.

22:44.097 --> 22:46.013
No seriously.

22:46.055 --> 22:47.013
Do you hear it?

22:47.055 --> 22:47.930
No.

22:56.597 --> 22:57.805
I heard.

22:59.555 --> 23:01.430
Ugh. Kids, eh?

23:02.722 --> 23:03.805
A sound.

23:07.055 --> 23:09.430
There's nobody
here for miles.

23:09.472 --> 23:10.430
Listen.

23:12.763 --> 23:15.055
Lucie man.

23:15.097 --> 23:17.013
That was like
the Trump crotch.

23:17.264 --> 23:19.347
Pretty much a whole
bottle of Diet Coke.

23:20.013 --> 23:22.597
Crazy bitch.

23:36.472 --> 23:38.763
Okay so I have an idea.

23:38.805 --> 23:41.596
Let's all cast ourselves as 80s

23:41.638 --> 23:43.513
slasher characters.

23:43.555 --> 23:44.346
Ooh.

23:44.388 --> 23:45.471
All right, I'll go first.

23:45.513 --> 23:48.763
I'll be the gorgeous bitchy one.

23:49.763 --> 23:51.930
David, you'll be the geek.

23:51.972 --> 23:52.930
Thanks.

23:52.972 --> 23:55.805
Joe the handsome jock.

23:57.805 --> 24:00.388
Evelyn, the smart cookie.

24:00.430 --> 24:02.972
As the final girl,
she'll survive all of us.

24:04.013 --> 24:05.930
Lucie, token slut.

24:05.972 --> 24:06.888
Oi!

24:08.638 --> 24:10.055
I'm an innocent uni student.

24:10.930 --> 24:13.596
Sorry,
I almost forgotten Luke the um,

24:13.638 --> 24:15.430
token bad boy.

24:15.472 --> 24:18.846
Online poker professional,
thank you very much.

24:18.888 --> 24:20.721
What the hell is that?

24:20.763 --> 24:22.305
I don't know.

24:22.347 --> 24:23.888
You are so busted.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.430
You snuck your phone out.

24:25.472 --> 24:27.471
I said no phones Joe.

24:27.513 --> 24:28.722
Same rule for everyone.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.805
Did you kitties
bring your cell phones?

24:33.472 --> 24:34.347
Give it to me.

24:35.513 --> 24:37.013
- Come on.
- Joe!

24:37.055 --> 24:39.888
She
sounds serious Joe.

24:44.013 --> 24:45.847
What are you doing?

24:51.763 --> 24:53.513
She just threw my
phone out the window!

24:53.555 --> 24:55.263
She just shot way up
in my estimation.

24:55.305 --> 24:56.680
I can't believe you did that.

24:56.722 --> 24:59.263
It's 82 Joe. There
were no phones remember?

25:01.388 --> 25:02.805
Well I guess
it's just a phone.

25:04.597 --> 25:05.472
Ugh.

25:08.472 --> 25:10.638
Who the hell is that?

25:11.305 --> 25:12.597
Oh shit.

25:14.888 --> 25:17.014
Oh god it's Laura.

25:17.056 --> 25:18.555
Quick hide the booze.

25:19.597 --> 25:20.430
Who?

25:20.472 --> 25:22.555
Oh Joe's insane ex wife.

25:29.638 --> 25:31.222
Look, I'll deal with it.

25:41.763 --> 25:43.597
What the fuck are
you doing here?

25:44.056 --> 25:45.138
I'm sorry.

25:45.597 --> 25:46.721
What is it?

25:46.763 --> 25:48.263
I had to see you.

25:48.305 --> 25:50.180
How did you even
know I was here?

25:50.222 --> 25:54.430
Your secretary, I screamed at
her and she gave the address.

25:54.472 --> 25:56.596
Are you okay?

25:56.638 --> 25:59.763
No. No I'm not.

26:00.263 --> 26:01.346
I'm not okay.

26:01.388 --> 26:02.347
I'm lonely.

26:03.263 --> 26:04.305
You're not there.

26:04.347 --> 26:06.721
You're on TV talking about
the film all the time.

26:06.763 --> 26:07.597
Oh, God...

26:08.056 --> 26:08.888
I miss you.

26:08.930 --> 26:10.513
What the fuck are
you talking about?

26:10.555 --> 26:12.263
You're out of
your fucking mind.

26:14.305 --> 26:16.472
Sorry, I'm pathetic.

26:17.888 --> 26:18.722
I'll go.

26:19.680 --> 26:22.388
Look Laura, Laura.
Come inside a moment.

26:24.555 --> 26:26.930
You have a missed call from me.

26:37.805 --> 26:40.472
Everybody this is Laura.

26:40.722 --> 26:42.305
I think you've met.

26:42.347 --> 26:43.180
Oh hi.

26:43.222 --> 26:46.180
How are you?

26:46.222 --> 26:51.638
Oh, you know,
I've been better.

26:51.680 --> 26:52.555
I do know.

26:56.347 --> 26:58.638
Let's put the kettle on,
shall we.

26:58.680 --> 27:00.555
If you guys want
to start the movie.

27:35.513 --> 27:36.931
I'm going for a swim.

27:36.973 --> 27:38.014
A swim?

27:38.055 --> 27:40.513
A swim, a sauna, whatever.

27:40.555 --> 27:41.846
I just need to clear my head.

27:41.888 --> 27:43.263
We're at a party.

27:43.305 --> 27:45.097
Yeah well I need to relax.

27:46.931 --> 27:49.263
He's lost his damn mind.

27:49.305 --> 27:50.847
David go and talk to him.

27:50.889 --> 27:51.847
Oh come on Catherine.

27:51.889 --> 27:53.180
There's no point
in talking to him

27:53.222 --> 27:55.180
when he's in one of his moods.

27:55.222 --> 27:56.263
He's worse than me!

27:59.555 --> 28:01.763
I knew this was a bad idea.

28:13.180 --> 28:14.180
What're you doing?

28:14.222 --> 28:15.889
You said there's a spa,
I'm going for a swim.

28:15.931 --> 28:17.263
Are you fucking insane?

28:17.305 --> 28:18.513
I have to go.

28:18.555 --> 28:19.889
You're going
back to that pub?

28:19.931 --> 28:21.847
Promise me you're not
planning on drinking.

28:21.889 --> 28:24.055
I promise. I promise!

28:24.097 --> 28:24.931
Okay?

29:03.763 --> 29:05.472
Hello,
you've lost your friend?

29:06.638 --> 29:08.513
I just needed some air.

29:08.555 --> 29:11.138
Hope I didn't
scare you off earlier.

29:11.638 --> 29:13.596
So, what can I get you?

29:13.638 --> 29:15.596
Scotch, neat.

29:15.638 --> 29:16.847
Double?

29:16.889 --> 29:17.763
Yeah why not.

29:19.889 --> 29:21.930
Here you go.
It's on the house.

29:21.972 --> 29:23.555
A whiskey for the movie star.

29:27.513 --> 29:30.638
Do you know who that Range
Rover outside belongs to?

29:30.680 --> 29:32.430
Planning on buying it?

29:36.347 --> 29:37.222
Good stuff right?

29:40.806 --> 29:41.680
Another?

29:42.972 --> 29:43.889
I'd best not.

29:43.930 --> 29:44.848
Ah, go on.

29:45.388 --> 29:46.471
Whoa. Whoa,

29:46.513 --> 29:47.722
the next one's on me.

29:49.888 --> 29:52.263
Dude,
you were brilliant earlier.

29:52.305 --> 29:53.596
Hey, you know that
Ray Kelly guy

29:53.638 --> 29:54.472
you're playing?

29:55.848 --> 29:57.013
I met him once.

29:58.888 --> 30:00.806
Would you like
to take again, sir?

30:00.848 --> 30:02.055
19.

30:05.388 --> 30:07.013
House, 21 blackjack.

30:07.055 --> 30:07.847
House wins.

30:07.888 --> 30:08.764
Unlucky chance.

30:14.055 --> 30:15.097
I'm a fan.

30:20.263 --> 30:22.055
You got a ticket
in your pocket?

30:22.097 --> 30:23.596
A ticket?

30:26.305 --> 30:28.263
You got a theater ticket?

30:28.305 --> 30:29.680
A fucking theater ticket?

30:29.722 --> 30:30.597
You got one?

30:31.888 --> 30:33.346
Uh no.

30:33.388 --> 30:35.346
We're doing a show tonight.

30:35.388 --> 30:36.472
Oh yeah, I know.

30:37.764 --> 30:40.346
If you're such
a big fucking fan,

30:40.388 --> 30:42.596
why don't you have a theater
ticket in your pocket?

30:42.638 --> 30:43.888
I'm broke.

30:43.930 --> 30:45.846
You're broke and your
fucking sitting here

30:45.888 --> 30:47.180
playing fucking cards?

30:47.222 --> 30:49.555
You're fucking betting
like a fucking whore.

30:49.888 --> 30:51.388
You just lost a fan.

30:54.723 --> 30:55.555
Come on little fuck!

30:55.597 --> 30:56.263
Mr. Kelly!

30:56.388 --> 30:57.346
Come on!

30:57.388 --> 30:58.346
You wanna fucking play games?
Come on!

30:58.388 --> 31:00.846
Come on.

31:00.888 --> 31:02.097
That's a hell of a story.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.180
- I've got to get going.
- No.

31:07.222 --> 31:08.388
Shots?

31:08.430 --> 31:09.513
No, thanks.

31:09.555 --> 31:11.805
You get home safe, yeah?

31:18.472 --> 31:19.930
All right then.

31:48.764 --> 31:50.221
What the hell?

31:50.263 --> 31:51.763
Ahh, fuck!

32:22.430 --> 32:23.681
Oh, I'm sorry.

32:30.681 --> 32:32.430
Are you all right?

32:36.430 --> 32:37.847
Yes, I'm fine.

32:42.598 --> 32:44.681
Stop fucking following me!

32:54.180 --> 32:55.013
Yes, I'm fine.

32:56.930 --> 33:00.597
Excuse me,
do I know you from somewhere?

33:00.639 --> 33:02.597
I'm Joe Johnson, the comedian.

33:02.639 --> 33:04.013
Of course you are.

33:05.263 --> 33:06.888
How stupid of me.

33:06.930 --> 33:08.639
Is that your Jeep outside?

33:08.681 --> 33:09.930
It is.

33:09.972 --> 33:11.430
Because I saw it earlier too.

33:11.472 --> 33:12.513
Outside the pub.

33:12.555 --> 33:14.680
Oh yeah, I park it
outside there for business.

33:14.722 --> 33:15.930
I'm an electrician.

33:15.972 --> 33:18.096
I can't park outside
where we're working,

33:18.138 --> 33:20.180
so you know it's funny,

33:20.222 --> 33:22.221
I've never once set
foot inside that pub.

33:22.263 --> 33:23.846
- Are you fucking with me?
- What?

33:23.888 --> 33:25.556
You're fucking with me!

33:27.598 --> 33:28.597
Excuse me?

33:29.805 --> 33:31.055
It's not even your voice!

33:31.097 --> 33:32.055
You live in London.

33:32.097 --> 33:33.846
- Listen, you've got me confused.
- It was you!

33:33.888 --> 33:34.680
I live here!

33:34.722 --> 33:36.846
You heckled me!

33:36.888 --> 33:37.680
You're the heckler!

33:37.722 --> 33:39.721
I'm sorry.
I really have no idea

33:39.763 --> 33:41.222
what you're talking about.

34:20.556 --> 34:21.388
Yes, yes, yes.

34:21.430 --> 34:22.680
When it does go to print

34:22.722 --> 34:24.556
make sure it's
in big bold letters,

34:24.598 --> 34:26.556
Ray Kelly and his
wife were found

34:26.598 --> 34:28.222
gunned down in their home.

34:31.430 --> 34:32.556
Hmm. For the last time.

34:32.598 --> 34:34.930
Yes, Ray and his wife
were found gunned down

34:34.972 --> 34:35.763
in their home,

34:35.805 --> 34:37.556
seemingly without motive.

34:37.597 --> 34:38.388
I know.

34:38.430 --> 34:40.263
It is a bit bizarre, isn't it?

34:40.305 --> 34:43.221
Who hung this
on the front door?!

34:43.263 --> 34:44.721
Did somebody here do this?

34:44.763 --> 34:46.721
Babe, are you drunk?

34:46.763 --> 34:49.221
No I'm not fucking drunk!

34:49.263 --> 34:52.388
Joe, we've all been sat
in here since you left.

34:53.638 --> 34:55.055
I know I must,

34:55.097 --> 34:57.930
Catherine, that heckler
from the other night.

34:57.972 --> 34:59.472
I think he's crazy.

34:59.514 --> 35:02.346
I picked on the wrong
guy, and took it too far.

35:02.388 --> 35:04.680
And now he's stalking me.

35:04.722 --> 35:07.596
He followed us here, he
called me at the pub,

35:07.638 --> 35:10.221
and described the
shirt I was wearing.

35:10.263 --> 35:11.388
It's him!

35:11.972 --> 35:15.596
He hung this on the front door!

35:15.638 --> 35:17.346
It was probably just kids.

35:17.388 --> 35:18.888
You know,
the old killer clown thing.

35:18.930 --> 35:20.638
But there's nobody for miles.

35:20.680 --> 35:22.346
Right?

35:22.388 --> 35:24.346
You son of a bitch.

35:24.388 --> 35:27.096
You dumb asses,
he's messing with you.

35:29.388 --> 35:30.888
Oh brilliant!

35:30.930 --> 35:32.596
Brilliant!

35:32.638 --> 35:34.222
He got me! Hah aha!

35:40.013 --> 35:41.388
Good one mate.

35:42.722 --> 35:45.055
More convincing than
yours, babe.

35:45.097 --> 35:47.180
Fuck yeah,
feel my heart beating.

35:47.222 --> 35:49.638
Agreed. Brilliant.

35:52.763 --> 35:55.180
Where did you
get that stupid mask?

35:55.222 --> 35:57.347
There was a service
station on the way.

36:03.222 --> 36:04.263
Excuse me.

36:31.222 --> 36:32.305
Lucie!

36:39.763 --> 36:42.721
Lucie look, I'm flattered.

36:42.763 --> 36:44.888
Oi! Lucie!

36:45.431 --> 36:47.055
Just a sec.

36:47.097 --> 36:48.555
I'm going
out for a smoke.

36:59.097 --> 37:00.846
Can you get rid
of this psychopath,

37:00.888 --> 37:02.263
so we can all have a drink?

37:05.972 --> 37:07.138
Evelyn.

37:07.180 --> 37:08.680
Can you give us a minute?

37:16.722 --> 37:18.389
What are you plans?

37:18.431 --> 37:19.680
Throwing me out?

37:19.722 --> 37:20.597
No.

37:21.763 --> 37:23.263
I'm just asking.

37:24.222 --> 37:25.805
You don't give a shit do you?

37:28.555 --> 37:30.013
Since we got married

37:30.055 --> 37:32.513
I waited for you to
fall in love with me.

37:32.555 --> 37:33.638
But you never did.

37:34.930 --> 37:36.472
I just want you to be happy.

37:37.472 --> 37:38.972
And I'm happy with you.

37:40.138 --> 37:41.888
I can't do this.

37:41.930 --> 37:43.722
Come on, just fuck me.

37:45.389 --> 37:47.055
I need it.

37:47.097 --> 37:47.972
Hmm?

38:08.680 --> 38:10.221
This shit is potent.

38:10.263 --> 38:11.722
Well give us some then.

38:16.805 --> 38:17.638
Mmm.

38:17.680 --> 38:19.138
How are them
big titties anyway?

38:19.597 --> 38:21.472
These are just me
dad's headphones.

38:25.138 --> 38:26.638
Mmm. You're so hard.

38:30.472 --> 38:31.847
You're a crazy bitch.

38:32.805 --> 38:34.805
She could do with a few tokes.

38:35.763 --> 38:38.846
Why don't we go check out
that creepy garden then?

38:38.888 --> 38:40.138
Let's go girl.

39:04.930 --> 39:06.222
Knock, knock.

39:06.264 --> 39:07.721
How does it feel knowing

39:07.763 --> 39:09.930
you are going to die tonight.

39:09.972 --> 39:11.264
What will you miss?

39:11.306 --> 39:12.513
The applause?

39:12.555 --> 39:14.055
The whisky?

39:14.097 --> 39:16.846
Will you miss the pictures
she draws for you?

39:16.888 --> 39:18.721
Are you trying to be profound?

39:18.763 --> 39:20.638
Because this stuff is painful.

39:20.680 --> 39:23.346
Do you make other people
sit through this shit?

39:23.388 --> 39:25.055
No Joe.

39:25.097 --> 39:26.097
Only you.

39:28.597 --> 39:30.388
Well look I'm flattered.

39:30.430 --> 39:31.722
But I like women.

39:32.763 --> 39:33.972
I know you do.

39:36.722 --> 39:37.805
How about you?

39:39.264 --> 39:40.721
Do you have any hobbies

39:40.763 --> 39:43.346
aside from this
amateur stalking thing?

39:43.388 --> 39:44.888
It's hilarious.

39:44.930 --> 39:46.888
I mean,
are you outside right now?

39:46.930 --> 39:49.264
Looking in,
watching my every move?

39:50.597 --> 39:51.597
You must be cold.

39:52.722 --> 39:54.888
Why don't you come
in and join the party?

39:55.763 --> 39:57.388
I'm not really a party guy.

39:57.430 --> 39:59.471
Yeah I didn't think so.

39:59.513 --> 40:01.805
I can think of better
ways to entertain myself.

40:01.847 --> 40:03.013
Chronic masturbation?

40:04.763 --> 40:07.264
Let's get back to those
late night empty roads,

40:07.305 --> 40:09.138
you travel as you tour.

40:10.597 --> 40:12.930
You are so lame.

40:12.972 --> 40:15.263
The loneliness of those
roads must be a constant

40:15.305 --> 40:18.597
reminder of those empty
super market aisles.

40:20.055 --> 40:21.638
The day your daddy disappeared.

40:22.638 --> 40:23.638
Poor little Joe.

40:25.139 --> 40:27.763
The movie star all
alone in the world.

40:29.223 --> 40:30.930
Like he is in the
room right now.

40:32.097 --> 40:32.972
Bye Joe.

40:34.305 --> 40:35.181
It's show time.

40:53.055 --> 40:55.139
I knew you'd follow me.

41:05.847 --> 41:07.805
You know what I hate the most?

41:10.430 --> 41:13.181
She'll be your date
at the film premiere.

41:15.347 --> 41:18.347
Oh, oh, hello Joe.

41:21.347 --> 41:23.055
Oh naughty boy.

41:28.722 --> 41:29.597
Oh.

41:32.139 --> 41:33.722
Wow, okay.

41:36.305 --> 41:38.638
What are you doing now Joe?

41:39.972 --> 41:41.722
Joe not so high, my stomach!

41:43.056 --> 41:43.930
Joe.

41:45.472 --> 41:46.846
Joe please.

41:49.056 --> 41:49.888
Joe!

41:54.388 --> 41:55.721
Joe stop it.

42:21.263 --> 42:23.430
Would you hurry up and
cum already?

42:23.472 --> 42:25.346
It's got a bit boring now.

42:25.388 --> 42:28.263
Hurry up I'm
freezing my tits off.

42:34.098 --> 42:35.388
You okay?

42:35.430 --> 42:36.596
Yeah.

42:36.638 --> 42:38.930
You look like you were
about to have a heart attack.

42:38.972 --> 42:40.555
Don't die on me.

42:40.597 --> 42:41.471
I'll try not to.

42:41.513 --> 42:43.388
Well thanks for that.

42:43.430 --> 42:46.513
I can take sex in the
woods off my bucket list.

42:46.555 --> 42:47.430
Lucie.

42:48.513 --> 42:49.930
Are you using me for sex?

42:53.472 --> 42:54.305
You are?

42:55.472 --> 42:56.972
Joe tried it on me earlier.

42:57.888 --> 42:59.430
He tried to kiss me.

42:59.472 --> 43:00.930
Oh shit.

43:00.972 --> 43:02.721
What is that it?

43:02.763 --> 43:05.680
What do you want me to do,
smack him or something?

43:05.722 --> 43:07.721
It might make things
a bit awkward.

43:07.763 --> 43:09.555
You're a prick aren't you?

43:09.597 --> 43:11.430
I'm supposed to be your girl.

43:11.472 --> 43:13.056
Look,
I'll have a word with him later.

43:13.097 --> 43:13.973
Well yeah.

43:17.555 --> 43:19.138
Did you hear that?

43:20.305 --> 43:24.388
Some mad man showed up
with an axe in the woods.

43:24.430 --> 43:27.056
No.
I'm being serious this time.

43:28.097 --> 43:29.056
Yeah sure.

43:54.097 --> 43:54.973
Luke?

43:57.722 --> 43:58.597
Luke?

44:05.222 --> 44:07.346
If you jump out at me

44:07.388 --> 44:09.305
I'll fucking kill you.

44:14.973 --> 44:15.847
Fuck this.

44:17.305 --> 44:19.305
I'm ignoring ya.

44:42.638 --> 44:45.222
Well that's an improvement.

46:58.430 --> 46:59.471
Hey.

46:59.513 --> 47:00.764
Hi.

47:02.138 --> 47:03.138
You look shattered.

47:03.180 --> 47:05.513
Yeah, oh. Went for a run.

47:06.638 --> 47:08.013
Where is Catherine?

47:08.055 --> 47:09.013
Oh I don't know.

47:09.055 --> 47:11.222
She had to write a press
release or something.

47:13.138 --> 47:17.597
Here, don't tell anyone,
but she snuck her laptop in.

47:18.806 --> 47:20.888
Bloody workaholic.

47:22.555 --> 47:26.930
Yeah, it seems this movie has
taken over everyone's life.

47:26.972 --> 47:28.430
What are you doing?

47:28.472 --> 47:29.388
Oh come on.

47:30.888 --> 47:31.930
What the fuck?

47:31.972 --> 47:33.596
You held my eyes
at dinner last night.

47:33.638 --> 47:35.681
No, you held mine
and it creeped me out.

47:35.723 --> 47:39.430
David,
take your hands off me please.

47:41.222 --> 47:44.638
Oh, sorry I misunderstood.

47:46.430 --> 47:48.472
Yeah, I think you did.

48:10.222 --> 48:11.055
Joe.

48:49.930 --> 48:50.805
Joe?

49:15.055 --> 49:16.721
Ahh.

49:16.763 --> 49:17.639
Fuck.

49:21.847 --> 49:22.846
What?

49:22.888 --> 49:24.430
What was that?

49:24.472 --> 49:25.556
I thought you wanted to!

49:25.598 --> 49:27.598
Not like that. You used me.

49:29.055 --> 49:30.055
Oh come on Cat.

49:32.222 --> 49:33.305
I need a cigarette.

49:34.430 --> 49:35.388
You gave up.

49:37.263 --> 49:39.222
Yeah just like
you gave up booze.

50:26.388 --> 50:27.514
Evelyn!

50:27.556 --> 50:29.680
I don't want to
talk to you right now.

50:29.722 --> 50:30.805
Look I didn't buy the mask

50:30.847 --> 50:31.721
at the service station.

50:31.763 --> 50:32.388
He's here.

50:32.430 --> 50:33.347
Who's here?

50:38.430 --> 50:39.430
There is somebody here.

50:39.472 --> 50:40.680
I saw them from the window.

50:40.722 --> 50:41.680
Oh the heckler?

50:41.722 --> 50:43.263
I don't know, he was
wearing a clown mask,

50:43.305 --> 50:44.472
or something.

50:45.972 --> 50:47.055
Get over yourself.

50:47.097 --> 50:48.346
You're not being stalked.

50:48.388 --> 50:49.930
You're just delusional.

50:49.972 --> 50:50.888
Oh my god.

51:07.763 --> 51:08.598
Laura!

51:09.722 --> 51:11.221
We have to go
where are your keys?

51:11.263 --> 51:12.221
In the house.

51:12.263 --> 51:13.638
Well where is he?

51:13.680 --> 51:14.514
I don't know!

51:14.556 --> 51:15.430
What does he want?

51:15.472 --> 51:16.263
To destroy me.

51:16.305 --> 51:17.721
He called me this morning.

51:17.763 --> 51:19.805
This morning, and you
didn't think to tell anyone!

51:28.722 --> 51:29.556
They were here!

51:29.597 --> 51:31.680
Don't you know
how to hot wire a car?

51:31.722 --> 51:33.556
I can't even tune a radio.

51:34.638 --> 51:35.930
We got to call for help.

51:38.597 --> 51:40.472
The fucking line is dead.

51:40.514 --> 51:41.763
Joe do something!

51:41.805 --> 51:43.388
Shh!

51:43.430 --> 51:45.431
Laura, she called me earlier.

51:45.473 --> 51:46.638
She has a phone.

51:47.597 --> 51:49.180
Just wait here.

51:49.222 --> 51:51.138
No fucking way. Joe!

52:43.930 --> 52:46.180
Shit, shit, shit!

52:46.222 --> 52:48.389
Take it! Fucking take it!

52:55.473 --> 52:57.389
I did warn you Joe.

52:57.431 --> 52:59.263
Dangerous profession of yours.

52:59.305 --> 53:02.221
After all, look what
happened to Ray Kelly.

53:02.263 --> 53:05.013
Holy fuck,
you killed Ray Kelly?

53:05.055 --> 53:07.721
Take off the mask,
Joe take off the mask!

53:07.763 --> 53:10.721
You got a name
creepy heckler guy?

53:10.763 --> 53:11.972
You don't wanna know.

53:19.888 --> 53:21.555
Get ready for a surprise.

53:24.930 --> 53:27.555
It was all a joke
Mr. Movie Star.

53:27.597 --> 53:29.221
Don't you remember me?

53:29.263 --> 53:31.347
Alex. 20 years ago?

53:31.389 --> 53:32.763
What's he talking about?

53:34.431 --> 53:35.930
I don't know.

53:36.888 --> 53:39.096
You killed my
father Ray Kelly!

53:39.138 --> 53:40.680
What?

53:40.722 --> 53:41.888
Tell them Joe!

53:41.930 --> 53:44.221
Tell them you have
blood on your hands.

53:44.263 --> 53:45.138
Babe?

53:47.097 --> 53:48.055
He's crazy!

53:49.097 --> 53:50.722
Joe what the fuck's going on?

53:52.431 --> 53:53.763
I don't know.

53:55.431 --> 53:57.348
I don't know what
he's talking about.

53:58.763 --> 54:00.348
Babe. Look at me.

54:01.597 --> 54:02.597
Did you do that?

54:04.138 --> 54:06.096
Of course not.

54:06.138 --> 54:09.305
I know you did. I was there.

54:11.638 --> 54:13.596
I invited you here to my house,

54:13.638 --> 54:15.013
for a reason.

54:15.055 --> 54:16.722
You said it was your friend's.

54:17.722 --> 54:19.513
Hmm.
My brother's not the only one

54:19.555 --> 54:20.638
who has been playing a role.

54:22.930 --> 54:24.555
Oh my dear brother.

54:25.805 --> 54:27.138
You did great.

54:28.138 --> 54:30.722
Love the pumpkin heads.

54:30.972 --> 54:32.430
Very creative.

54:32.472 --> 54:34.263
What the fuck?!

54:35.930 --> 54:37.513
Who's the shitty actress now?

54:37.555 --> 54:38.222
But truly Joe, the award for
best performance

54:38.306 --> 54:39.306
goes to you!

54:45.222 --> 54:47.722
I've got no idea
what's going on.

54:48.847 --> 54:50.013
Stay there.

54:51.847 --> 54:53.513
You're not going anywhere.

54:57.597 --> 54:58.555
Catherine!

54:59.430 --> 55:02.180
- Catherine come on.
- You are staying here.

55:03.430 --> 55:04.763
Cath come on.

55:04.805 --> 55:06.846
God he's good.

55:06.888 --> 55:09.763
Another first class performance.

55:09.805 --> 55:13.763
He just seems so lovely
and normal, doesn't he?

55:14.888 --> 55:16.513
And yet...

55:19.348 --> 55:20.805
How could you?

55:29.805 --> 55:31.388
Hey!

55:31.430 --> 55:33.223
Get me a cigar!

55:34.306 --> 55:36.472
Today! Can you fucking hear me?

55:37.055 --> 55:38.306
Coming.

55:43.223 --> 55:44.972
One cigar, Mr. Kelly.

55:47.097 --> 55:48.888
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

55:49.805 --> 55:51.346
You smoking something.

55:51.388 --> 55:53.055
No I am not smoking something,

55:53.097 --> 55:54.555
I'm excited to see you.

55:55.223 --> 55:56.306
You look tired.

55:56.555 --> 55:57.597
I am.

56:00.597 --> 56:02.846
53 fucking theaters.

56:02.888 --> 56:05.223
Never shoulda agreed
to that fucking tour.

56:06.388 --> 56:07.888
Feeling old.

56:07.930 --> 56:09.388
No you're not.

56:09.430 --> 56:10.638
Hmm. I am.

56:16.597 --> 56:18.388
What's your name again?

56:18.430 --> 56:19.388
Hmm.

56:20.763 --> 56:23.222
Do you remember
when we first met?

56:23.264 --> 56:24.888
No.

56:24.930 --> 56:27.055
Well I was very
impressed by your...

56:27.097 --> 56:28.888
You had a
great fucking ass.

56:28.930 --> 56:30.430
That's why you're here.

56:31.888 --> 56:33.597
Well we've been
married a year.

56:36.264 --> 56:37.264
Don't remind me.

56:39.930 --> 56:41.430
Got another Christmas card.

56:50.388 --> 56:51.846
I missed you.

56:51.888 --> 56:53.472
You missed the fucking money.

56:54.472 --> 56:56.388
Mmm. A little bit of both.

56:56.430 --> 56:59.139
No, no, no.

57:00.305 --> 57:02.388
Stay down there.

57:02.430 --> 57:04.388
So pop a pill.

57:04.430 --> 57:07.596
No it gives me a headache.

57:07.638 --> 57:09.763
Well you don't want me?

57:11.513 --> 57:12.555
I want you,

57:12.597 --> 57:14.555
I want you to take
a fucking shower.

57:18.430 --> 57:19.972
Who the fuck is that?

57:20.555 --> 57:23.472
Hey! Get up and
take a fucking shower.

57:25.305 --> 57:26.930
God fucking dammit.

57:28.847 --> 57:30.347
Who's fucking here now?

57:39.930 --> 57:41.139
What the fuck?

58:22.388 --> 58:24.513
Ray? Oh my god.

58:24.555 --> 58:26.139
Oh my god, oh fuck.

58:30.430 --> 58:31.763
Who are you?

58:36.305 --> 58:39.388
Not as easy to kill
with the mask off is it?

58:39.430 --> 58:40.346
Okay you listen,

58:40.388 --> 58:41.846
you listen to me.

58:41.888 --> 58:43.221
Whoever you are,
whatever you want.

58:43.263 --> 58:44.305
Whatever's happened.

58:45.222 --> 58:47.430
I know my husband was
not a very nice person.

58:48.930 --> 58:51.722
And you've done this now,
and he's gone.

58:53.597 --> 58:55.263
But I promise you,

58:55.305 --> 58:57.014
if you pull that trigger
the second time,

58:57.056 --> 58:58.472
it will cement you as this,

59:01.763 --> 59:03.221
as a killer.

59:03.263 --> 59:06.180
Please there is no going back.

59:06.222 --> 59:07.763
You'll be gone too darling.

59:09.888 --> 59:12.513
I can see you're scared.

59:12.555 --> 59:13.888
You're a kid.

59:15.430 --> 59:17.930
I can see that you're good.

1:00:32.305 --> 1:00:33.388
I'm sorry.

1:00:48.973 --> 1:00:51.471
I can still smell
the burning plastic.

1:00:51.513 --> 1:00:53.846
You thought I was dead, right?

1:00:53.888 --> 1:00:55.638
You shot me in the face.

1:00:55.680 --> 1:00:56.846
Not in the brain.

1:00:56.888 --> 1:01:00.638
But sometimes people have
to fucking learn a lesson.

1:01:23.097 --> 1:01:24.680
You are nothing.

1:01:24.722 --> 1:01:27.596
You remember what
a piece of shit you are.

1:01:35.472 --> 1:01:37.889
I'm Ray fucking Kelly.

1:01:37.931 --> 1:01:39.931
I'm the king of fucking lessons.

1:01:43.097 --> 1:01:44.263
But Alex.

1:01:49.638 --> 1:01:50.931
That night.

1:02:05.138 --> 1:02:07.263
Why would I kill Ray Kelly?

1:02:07.305 --> 1:02:08.847
You will remember this day.

1:02:08.889 --> 1:02:11.096
You will remember this day.

1:02:11.138 --> 1:02:12.889
He's my hero!

1:02:12.931 --> 1:02:15.848
Yeah just like your dad was
when he walked out on you.

1:02:16.763 --> 1:02:18.848
Daddy didn't even care
you existed.

1:02:20.597 --> 1:02:22.430
You'll remember me.

1:02:35.597 --> 1:02:37.138
Say you love me.

1:02:38.472 --> 1:02:39.388
What?

1:02:40.638 --> 1:02:43.222
Oh you do though, don't you?

1:02:44.138 --> 1:02:46.764
You have your moments.

1:02:46.806 --> 1:02:48.430
Just say it!

1:02:49.722 --> 1:02:52.138
- Leave me alone.
- Hah, I knew it.

1:02:57.055 --> 1:02:59.971
You talk too much,
I'll give you that.

1:03:00.013 --> 1:03:01.763
You
will remember this day.

1:03:03.347 --> 1:03:05.097
You will remember me.

1:03:06.848 --> 1:03:07.722
Ray?

1:03:10.347 --> 1:03:12.430
Please
welcome to the stage.

1:03:12.472 --> 1:03:15.513
The legendary, Ray Kelly!

1:03:23.097 --> 1:03:24.596
Thank you very fucking much.

1:03:24.638 --> 1:03:26.388
It's been a great night,

1:03:26.430 --> 1:03:27.888
you've been a great
fucking audience.

1:03:27.930 --> 1:03:30.971
Fuck you and
drive fucking careful.

1:03:31.013 --> 1:03:32.138
Oi!

1:03:32.180 --> 1:03:33.930
Twat in the shit wig.

1:03:35.806 --> 1:03:36.764
Who said that?

1:03:36.806 --> 1:03:37.764
What?

1:03:37.806 --> 1:03:39.806
When's the real
comedian going to come on?

1:03:40.055 --> 1:03:42.680
Wait,
what the fuck did you just say?

1:03:43.930 --> 1:03:45.888
Oh, I'm sorry everybody.

1:03:45.930 --> 1:03:47.555
We have a fucking person here

1:03:47.597 --> 1:03:49.471
from the fucking
mental institution.

1:03:49.513 --> 1:03:51.513
Sitting right over there!

1:03:51.555 --> 1:03:53.013
How are you doing buddy?

1:03:53.055 --> 1:03:53.888
Doing great.

1:03:53.930 --> 1:03:54.888
Doing good huh?

1:03:54.930 --> 1:03:56.097
You call that a heckle?

1:03:56.597 --> 1:03:58.346
Is that what you're
fucking trying to do?

1:03:58.388 --> 1:04:00.180
Oh boy. I got a good one here.

1:04:00.222 --> 1:04:01.888
This is what I thrive on.

1:04:03.723 --> 1:04:05.930
All right, all right,
put up the lights.

1:04:06.555 --> 1:04:07.846
A young dude, all right.

1:04:07.888 --> 1:04:09.346
Come up here, come up here.

1:04:09.388 --> 1:04:10.930
Get your little ass up here.

1:04:10.972 --> 1:04:12.681
Ladies and gentlemen, give
him a round of applause

1:04:12.723 --> 1:04:13.596
ladies and gentlemen.

1:04:13.638 --> 1:04:14.764
Don't be scared.

1:04:16.222 --> 1:04:17.681
There, nice, nice.

1:04:17.723 --> 1:04:19.930
Ladies and gentlemen,
one night only.

1:04:19.972 --> 1:04:21.846
You're up here, I'm up here.

1:04:21.888 --> 1:04:23.388
We are here together.

1:04:23.430 --> 1:04:24.806
You want to fucking
say something?

1:04:27.055 --> 1:04:28.680
You want to say
something to the crowd?

1:04:30.430 --> 1:04:31.722
You wanna talk?

1:04:31.764 --> 1:04:33.555
Let me give you the microphone.

1:04:33.597 --> 1:04:34.681
There you go.

1:04:34.723 --> 1:04:35.888
Want to take the fucking mic?

1:04:35.930 --> 1:04:36.764
Say something.

1:04:38.597 --> 1:04:40.221
You got nothing to say.

1:04:40.263 --> 1:04:41.138
Nothing.

1:04:42.472 --> 1:04:44.055
You're a fucking nothing.

1:04:44.097 --> 1:04:47.013
You're a fucking
specimen of shit.

1:04:49.597 --> 1:04:51.263
Don't move, wait a minute.

1:04:51.305 --> 1:04:52.180
No pity for him.

1:04:52.222 --> 1:04:53.930
I don't want to hear Hoo,
eee, ahh.

1:04:55.597 --> 1:04:57.346
You're a fucking sperm.

1:04:57.388 --> 1:05:00.055
That didn't make it out of
your mother's fucking pussy.

1:05:00.097 --> 1:05:01.846
You came out of her ass.

1:05:01.888 --> 1:05:04.805
That's right, you are a
fucking piece of shit.

1:05:04.847 --> 1:05:06.681
You're nothing.

1:05:06.723 --> 1:05:08.346
This is a fucking lesson.

1:05:08.388 --> 1:05:09.639
You will remember this day.

1:05:09.681 --> 1:05:11.681
You will remember this day.

1:05:11.723 --> 1:05:13.930
You will remember me.

1:05:13.972 --> 1:05:15.430
These are the
fucking learning years.

1:05:15.472 --> 1:05:16.596
These are forming years.

1:05:16.638 --> 1:05:17.888
I am making you.

1:05:17.930 --> 1:05:19.763
One day, you will walk down

1:05:19.805 --> 1:05:21.930
the fucking street and
you will see me.

1:05:21.972 --> 1:05:23.930
I will be getting out
of a fucking limo.

1:05:23.972 --> 1:05:24.930
You will come over.

1:05:24.972 --> 1:05:27.221
You will sit on your
fucking hands and knees,

1:05:27.263 --> 1:05:29.597
and you will kiss my balls.

1:05:29.639 --> 1:05:33.221
And you will say "Thank
you, thank you Ray Kelly,

1:05:33.263 --> 1:05:35.597
for teaching me
a fucking lesson."

1:05:35.639 --> 1:05:39.013
And believe me I'm
being nice to you.

1:05:39.055 --> 1:05:42.388
This is Ray Kelly,
being fucking nice.

1:05:42.430 --> 1:05:45.013
I could of fucking
shot you up here.

1:05:45.055 --> 1:05:46.971
That what we fucking
do back in Brooklyn.

1:05:47.013 --> 1:05:49.763
We fucking shoot
pieces of shit like you.

1:05:49.805 --> 1:05:52.681
This is my fucking stage,
you understand that?

1:05:52.722 --> 1:05:54.639
You open your
fucking little whole,

1:05:54.681 --> 1:05:56.305
and this is what you get.

1:05:56.347 --> 1:05:58.681
Now get off my fucking stage.

1:05:59.763 --> 1:06:00.805
Don't fucking cry!

1:06:01.972 --> 1:06:02.805
Don't fucking cry!

1:06:02.847 --> 1:06:04.346
Who's your fucking daddy?

1:06:04.388 --> 1:06:06.138
I'm your fucking daddy!

1:06:09.888 --> 1:06:10.971
Ladies and gentlemen

1:06:11.013 --> 1:06:13.096
I apologize you had
to fucking hear this.

1:06:13.138 --> 1:06:16.555
Sometimes people have to
fucking learn a lesson.

1:06:18.055 --> 1:06:19.305
I'm Ray fucking Kelly.

1:06:19.347 --> 1:06:21.472
I'm the king of fucking lessons.

1:06:46.138 --> 1:06:49.013
I always wanted to star
in my own scary movie.

1:06:49.055 --> 1:06:51.721
Those are after all my
video tapes over there.

1:06:51.763 --> 1:06:54.639
You may have noticed,
mostly horror.

1:06:56.138 --> 1:06:57.680
Catherine!

1:06:57.722 --> 1:06:59.846
She is fucking crazy.

1:06:59.888 --> 1:07:00.763
Can't you see?

1:07:03.888 --> 1:07:04.888
Stay there!

1:07:05.888 --> 1:07:07.514
Just hold them
here until I get back.

1:07:07.556 --> 1:07:08.888
He's running away!

1:07:10.388 --> 1:07:13.013
You know I admire you in a way.

1:07:13.055 --> 1:07:16.180
One of those people that
return to the scene of a crime.

1:07:16.222 --> 1:07:19.430
You star in a movie
of a man you killed.

1:07:21.430 --> 1:07:23.930
Doesn't get any more
twisted than that.

1:07:24.805 --> 1:07:28.180
Knock, knock Joe Johnson,
is anyone home?

1:07:28.222 --> 1:07:29.097
Hello!

1:07:30.805 --> 1:07:32.598
You all make me sick.

1:07:42.888 --> 1:07:43.930
Catherine.

1:07:52.430 --> 1:07:53.347
Catherine!

1:08:01.597 --> 1:08:03.431
Catherine wait!

1:08:03.473 --> 1:08:04.305
Catherine!

1:08:06.556 --> 1:08:08.221
Why are you running away?

1:08:08.263 --> 1:08:09.138
Joe please.

1:08:10.138 --> 1:08:12.930
I'm not, it's me.

1:08:12.972 --> 1:08:14.763
Look at me Catherine it's me.

1:08:14.805 --> 1:08:16.972
- I just want to go.
- Where are you going?

1:08:18.430 --> 1:08:20.263
Please, I just want to go.

1:08:21.222 --> 1:08:23.013
I'm not going to hurt you.

1:08:23.055 --> 1:08:23.888
I know.

1:08:23.930 --> 1:08:25.055
You know?

1:08:25.097 --> 1:08:26.721
I do.

1:08:26.763 --> 1:08:28.430
Then why are you running away?

1:08:29.556 --> 1:08:31.055
I just need you to understand.

1:08:31.097 --> 1:08:33.347
Those two are crazy. It's lies!

1:08:35.763 --> 1:08:36.597
I know.

1:08:42.263 --> 1:08:44.013
What are you doing?

1:08:44.055 --> 1:08:45.263
It's just you didn't listen.

1:08:45.305 --> 1:08:48.805
You didn't listen and
now look what's happened.

1:08:48.847 --> 1:08:50.805
I always knew
you were a loser!

1:08:50.847 --> 1:08:51.805
Ugh what?

1:08:52.722 --> 1:08:54.013
No, no, no, no.

1:09:08.097 --> 1:09:08.930
Stop.

1:09:44.555 --> 1:09:45.389
Evelyn!

1:09:52.763 --> 1:09:54.180
Evelyn.

1:09:56.055 --> 1:09:57.431
Turn that handle

1:09:57.473 --> 1:09:59.555
I'm going to
turn you inside out.

1:10:05.222 --> 1:10:06.888
All of it was for you.

1:10:06.930 --> 1:10:09.513
The very first day we met.

1:10:09.555 --> 1:10:11.431
Been so much fun
playing a role of someone

1:10:11.472 --> 1:10:13.389
who actually cares about you.

1:10:16.431 --> 1:10:17.596
Whoopsies!

1:10:17.638 --> 1:10:19.221
Butter fingers!

1:10:19.263 --> 1:10:21.097
Go ahead, pick it up!

1:11:32.555 --> 1:11:35.555
You must have known your
past would catch up with you.

1:11:35.597 --> 1:11:37.306
It didn't scare you
reading the papers

1:11:37.348 --> 1:11:39.097
about Ray's surviving children?

1:11:40.013 --> 1:11:40.930
I never read them.

1:11:40.972 --> 1:11:43.180
I wanted to pretend
like it never happened.

1:11:43.222 --> 1:11:46.555
The thought of those
murders terrified me.

1:11:46.597 --> 1:11:47.597
I'm sorry.

1:11:48.513 --> 1:11:50.180
Oh no, I'm sorry.

1:11:51.472 --> 1:11:54.264
You had it in you to be better.

1:11:56.430 --> 1:11:57.972
When I was five,

1:11:59.472 --> 1:12:03.971
my dad, he took me
to the super market.

1:12:04.013 --> 1:12:06.888
I don't want to hear this.

1:12:06.930 --> 1:12:08.888
He left me in the aisles.

1:12:08.930 --> 1:12:10.638
A little kid.

1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:13.055
The fucking trolly
was bigger than me.

1:12:14.763 --> 1:12:17.888
Oh please just
hurry up and die!

1:12:17.930 --> 1:12:20.096
The only good thing in my life

1:12:20.138 --> 1:12:22.055
was Ray Kelly. Your dad.

1:12:23.055 --> 1:12:24.223
He made me laugh.

1:12:25.763 --> 1:12:29.680
When I knocked on your door
that night I'd been drinking.

1:12:29.722 --> 1:12:31.680
I just thought I
had the whole thing

1:12:31.722 --> 1:12:33.846
played out like a movie.

1:12:33.888 --> 1:12:35.805
It was like, it wasn't real.

1:12:36.763 --> 1:12:38.055
It wasn't me.

1:12:39.138 --> 1:12:40.430
But it was you.

1:12:41.138 --> 1:12:44.513
That night in our home,

1:12:44.555 --> 1:12:46.097
what you did.

1:12:51.305 --> 1:12:52.680
Go on!

1:12:52.722 --> 1:12:54.223
Just finish me off!

1:12:54.763 --> 1:12:55.763
Come on!

1:12:59.555 --> 1:13:01.763
You're going to
die soon anyway.

1:14:34.055 --> 1:14:35.763
Bizzare
reports are coming in.

1:14:35.805 --> 1:14:38.846
Seven found dead in
horrifying home invasion.

1:14:38.888 --> 1:14:41.971
Celebrity comedian Joe
Johnson is the sole survivor,

1:14:42.013 --> 1:14:44.680
of an horrific home invasion.
