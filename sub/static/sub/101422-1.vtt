00:32.119 --> 00:33.772
Through my life journey,

00:33.816 --> 00:35.078
I've come to discover the most

00:35.122 --> 00:37.298
beautiful love story ever told.

00:38.603 --> 00:41.215
The Book of Revelation is
not about doom and gloom

00:41.258 --> 00:42.868
as so many people think.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.785
It's about the revelation of
Jesus Christ,

00:46.829 --> 00:49.397
who he is, and what he's done
for us.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.095
The book of Revelation is one

00:52.139 --> 00:53.966
of the only books that offers

00:54.010 --> 00:55.838
a blessing to whoever reads it.

00:57.187 --> 01:00.538
It's one of the most extraordinary
books I've ever read.

01:02.584 --> 01:05.194
It starts off with a warning
to the seven churches.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.763
The first is the Church of
Ephesus,

01:07.806 --> 01:11.549
who God congratulated on the
patience and labor for him.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.290
But he had one thing against
them.

01:14.639 --> 01:17.120
They lost him, their first love.

01:18.556 --> 01:20.645
He wanted them to repent
or he would come quickly

01:20.689 --> 01:22.125
and remove their candlestick.

01:23.605 --> 01:26.260
If they overcame, he'd let
them eat the tree of life.

01:27.957 --> 01:31.787
The Church of Smyrna, though
poor, was spiritually rich.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.530
They went through much
tribulation for 10 days,

01:37.532 --> 01:40.012
but God told them to be faithful
to death

01:40.056 --> 01:43.146
and he'd give them the crown of
life.

01:45.192 --> 01:48.020
The Church of Pergamum, who
dwelled where Satan's seat is,

01:48.064 --> 01:51.546
yet held fast to God's name
and didn't deny the faith.

01:51.589 --> 01:54.331
Yet God had several things
against them.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.812
They held onto wrong teachings
of Balaam,

01:56.855 --> 01:59.989
which sought to set stumbling
blocks for God's children.

02:00.032 --> 02:01.730
Eat things, sacrifice to idols,

02:01.773 --> 02:04.341
and commit sexual acts of
fornication.

02:04.385 --> 02:05.690
God warns them to repent,

02:07.214 --> 02:09.564
or he would fight against
with the sword of his mouth.

02:10.695 --> 02:13.568
And if they overcame, he'd
give them manna and a new name,

02:14.612 --> 02:15.874
written in a white stone.

02:18.877 --> 02:20.531
To the Church of Thyatira,

02:23.230 --> 02:28.104
whose charity, service, and
works were known by God,

02:28.148 --> 02:29.975
but he had a few things against
them.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.804
They tolerated that woman,
Jezebel,

02:32.848 --> 02:35.155
which called herself a
prophetess,

02:35.198 --> 02:37.069
which taught and seduced God's
servants

02:37.113 --> 02:38.332
to commit fornication.

02:39.376 --> 02:40.986
He would cast her on a sick bed.

02:42.074 --> 02:43.424
And those that commit with her
will have

02:43.467 --> 02:46.731
great tribulation unless
they repent and turn.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.646
And he will kill their children
with debt.

02:48.690 --> 02:51.519
And all the church will know
that he searches the hearts.

02:52.563 --> 02:54.130
To him that overcomes,

02:54.174 --> 02:56.263
he will give him power over the
nations,

02:57.133 --> 02:59.266
and he will give him the morning
star.

02:59.309 --> 03:01.181
The Church of Sardis,

03:01.224 --> 03:02.747
who was commanded to be watchful

03:02.791 --> 03:05.620
and strengthen within them
that are ready to die.

03:06.621 --> 03:09.145
He commands them to repent and
watch,

03:10.668 --> 03:12.931
or he will come upon them like a
thief.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.674
The Church of Philadelphia,

03:17.936 --> 03:21.592
who have little strength,
yet didn't deny God's name.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.379
God sets an open door before
them

03:25.422 --> 03:28.251
and made those in the synagogue
of Satan

03:28.295 --> 03:31.341
that called themselves Jews
and were not, but lied.

03:32.647 --> 03:34.866
God will make them come
to worship at their feet.

03:36.999 --> 03:38.914
And to the Church of Laodiceans,

03:40.176 --> 03:43.310
who is neither hot,
nor cold, but lukewarm.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.965
God says he will vomit
them out of his mouth.

03:48.489 --> 03:51.448
So they are rich,
increased, and need nothing,

03:53.058 --> 03:55.626
but they don't know they're
poor, wretched, and miserable,

03:56.584 --> 03:57.759
blind and naked.

03:59.195 --> 04:01.284
He stands at the door and
knocks.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.287
And if any hears his
voice, he will come in

04:05.854 --> 04:06.724
and sit with him.

04:08.335 --> 04:12.034
The one who holds the seven
stars,

04:12.077 --> 04:15.167
whose head and hair were white
like wool,

04:16.125 --> 04:18.170
whose eyes were flame of fire,

04:18.214 --> 04:22.349
whose feet are bronze, like
fine brass burned in a furnace,

04:23.611 --> 04:25.743
whose voice with the sound of
many waters.

04:30.574 --> 04:34.796
In chapter 4, it goes into
talking about the throne

04:34.839 --> 04:36.580
that John saw set up in heaven

04:37.755 --> 04:40.149
and one that sat on that throne.

04:42.369 --> 04:45.285
Around the throne were 24
elders,

04:45.328 --> 04:47.983
with white clothing and gold
crowns.

04:49.506 --> 04:51.943
Lightning and thunder
proceeded from the throne,

04:53.293 --> 04:56.121
and a sea of glass like
crystal were before the throne.

04:57.688 --> 05:00.300
Four beasts full of eyes were
in the midst of the throne.

05:02.258 --> 05:03.477
One was like a lion,

05:04.565 --> 05:06.131
other, like a calf.

05:07.785 --> 05:09.483
Another had the face of man.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.312
And another was like a flying
eagle.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.968
Each of them had six wings.

05:17.012 --> 05:19.275
They were full of eyes,

05:19.319 --> 05:21.538
and they rest not, day and
night,

05:21.582 --> 05:24.193
saying, "Holy, holy, holy,

05:24.236 --> 05:28.937
"Lord God Almighty, which
was and is to come."

05:30.373 --> 05:32.375
And when they give glory to God,

05:32.419 --> 05:36.640
the 24 elders fall and throw
their crowns before the throne.

05:38.860 --> 05:42.037
And at the right hand of
him who sat on the throne,

05:42.080 --> 05:42.951
there was a book.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.781
And a strong angel proclaimed,

05:46.824 --> 05:50.437
"Who's worthy to open the
book and loose the seals?"

05:52.439 --> 05:55.224
And no man in heaven, nor Earth,

05:56.443 --> 05:59.402
or under the Earth was found
worthy enough to open the book,

06:00.795 --> 06:04.320
neither to look therein, except
for one.

06:05.234 --> 06:07.062
The lion of the tribe of Judah,

06:07.105 --> 06:08.716
the root of David has prevailed

06:08.759 --> 06:11.327
to open the book and
loose the seven seals.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.156
And when the Holy Land took the
book,

06:14.199 --> 06:17.464
the Elders sung a new
song, "You are Worthy."

06:18.987 --> 06:23.818
But this book, this book that
no one was worthy to open,

06:23.861 --> 06:26.386
is where it all began.

06:26.429 --> 06:29.127
And the seals, the opening
of seals, is the beginning

06:29.171 --> 06:31.434
of the most unforgettable
journey

06:31.478 --> 06:32.957
that no one will ever forget.

06:36.091 --> 06:38.006
But you may be wondering, who am
I?

06:39.703 --> 06:41.531
And where do I fit into this
story?

06:42.576 --> 06:43.968
My name is Joanna Shepherd,

06:46.057 --> 06:47.798
and I don't know how it all
started

06:47.842 --> 06:49.278
or how it all began,

06:51.062 --> 06:54.762
all I remember was there was no
peace.

08:14.581 --> 08:15.495
Mom?

08:18.106 --> 08:18.933
Dad.

08:21.457 --> 08:22.284
Evan.

08:51.269 --> 08:52.532
I don't know what happened.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.405
One second everything was fine.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.363
The next second, all hell broke
loose.

08:59.364 --> 09:00.757
Trains started derailing.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.630
Computer and data systems
started going down.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.588
Planes started crashing.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.895
People started panicking
for no good reason.

09:09.810 --> 09:12.029
I haven't gotten any sleep,

09:12.073 --> 09:14.728
because they've been breaking
in and killing nonstop.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.079
There's no peace.

09:21.778 --> 09:23.345
I know.

09:23.388 --> 09:24.738
They broke into my house.

09:26.174 --> 09:27.479
I heard gunshots inside.

09:27.523 --> 09:29.612
I can't find my mom or
my dad or my brother.

09:29.656 --> 09:32.572
Don't worry, I don't know
where my family is either,

09:32.615 --> 09:34.835
but at least we have each other.

09:51.155 --> 09:54.158
Do you remember that
time in the second grade

09:54.202 --> 09:57.727
when that girl with the big
buck tooth tried beating us up?

09:57.771 --> 09:59.773
Yeah, and you thought
you had superpowers,

09:59.816 --> 10:02.123
so you pulled out your
magic wand to stop her.

10:03.254 --> 10:04.604
She took it and snapped it in
half.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.388
And you tried to jump in and
save us,

10:06.431 --> 10:07.694
and she ended up head-butting
you.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.913
Yeah, I couldn't let
you get beat up alone.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.959
We had to get beaten up
together.

10:12.002 --> 10:12.829
You're my girl.

10:17.965 --> 10:22.970
You know, when all of this
happened,

10:24.972 --> 10:26.016
I thought I lost you.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.760
I went to your house
and I couldn't find you.

10:32.719 --> 10:33.894
I prayed you'd be okay.

10:36.374 --> 10:37.201
And here you are.

10:46.428 --> 10:47.255
So now what?

10:50.127 --> 10:51.999
I guess we wait and see.

11:08.276 --> 11:10.582
Today the world leaders
have gotten together

11:10.626 --> 11:12.933
and decided the only way to
secure peace

11:12.976 --> 11:16.066
in their countries is to
have one world leader.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.547
Today a new world leader has
been chosen

11:18.590 --> 11:20.810
to take the position
of becoming the leader

11:20.854 --> 11:22.682
of the entire world.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.336
Never before has this event
happened.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.861
The chosen leader has
accepted the invitation

11:27.904 --> 11:29.819
and is eager to take on the
challenge.

11:32.082 --> 11:33.388
Some idiot stole my car.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.391
Where did you just come from?

11:39.350 --> 11:40.134
What are you doing?

11:40.177 --> 11:41.396
I'm calling my job.

11:44.051 --> 11:44.747
Stupid phone's dead.

11:47.010 --> 11:49.230
You're not going back out
there.

11:49.273 --> 11:52.581
I've been late ever
since I got this job.

11:52.624 --> 11:53.669
He'll fire me.

11:53.713 --> 11:54.931
I haven't been there in four
days.

11:54.975 --> 11:56.367
Are you kidding?

11:56.411 --> 11:58.587
He probably hasn't been
there in four days, either.

11:58.630 --> 11:59.719
It's crazy out there.

11:59.762 --> 12:00.937
People are outside shooting each
other,

12:00.981 --> 12:02.591
and you're talking about going
to work.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.245
Do you want me to stop my
life?

12:05.289 --> 12:07.161
We won't have a house if I do
that.

12:10.817 --> 12:14.037
The dumb landlord's talking
about barricading us in

12:14.081 --> 12:16.257
or evicting us if we don't pay.

12:19.216 --> 12:21.175
After all this, his only focus
is money.

12:21.218 --> 12:22.742
He doesn't care.

12:29.792 --> 12:30.662
And he vows to work harder
than ever

12:30.706 --> 12:33.143
to bring world peace and unity.

12:33.187 --> 12:34.928
The new world leader plans to
make

12:34.971 --> 12:37.495
a seven-year peace treaty with
Israel.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.933
In this treaty, he also agrees
to rebuild

12:39.976 --> 12:41.804
the Promised Temple for Israel.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.372
He states, "If we would like
peace,

12:44.415 --> 12:46.374
"we must first give."

13:08.135 --> 13:09.179
I think it looks better on me.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.328
Help me, help me.

13:27.371 --> 13:29.809
Help me.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.419
Help me.

13:38.687 --> 13:40.123
Help me, help me.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.604
Help me.

13:42.647 --> 13:43.474
Help me.

13:55.573 --> 13:58.098
Eva, you okay, what happened?

13:58.141 --> 13:59.839
Please don't leave me.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.405
I'm not going to leave you.

14:01.449 --> 14:03.538
Please, they're gonna kill me.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.158
She's pregnant, Fay.

14:15.202 --> 14:16.812
They tortured her and beat her
to a pulp

14:16.856 --> 14:18.074
and said they're coming back to
kill her

14:18.118 --> 14:19.641
and beat her child out of her.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.688
I understand that, but we
can't afford

14:23.732 --> 14:25.603
to take in every wounded person.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.779
Fay, she's like family to me.

14:27.823 --> 14:30.739
Remember, she used to
babysit me all the time?

14:30.782 --> 14:32.349
Please, I can't put her back out
there

14:32.393 --> 14:33.437
and sleep peacefully.

14:35.439 --> 14:39.139
She's the only one, Fay, please.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.920
As time went on, things got
worse.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.621
We later found out that
Fay's job closed down

15:26.664 --> 15:28.188
because the owner was killed.

15:30.712 --> 15:33.193
It became hard to get
things necessary for living.

15:37.458 --> 15:41.723
And the stores were
closed down, abandoned.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.551
Soon the focus of our lives
revolved

15:43.594 --> 15:45.335
around fighting for our
survival,

15:47.381 --> 15:49.905
finding things off of the
bodies of dead people became

15:49.949 --> 15:51.776
a norm for our day-to-day
living.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.826
Every day, our lives drastically
changed.

15:59.262 --> 16:01.569
There was nothing we could do
about it.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.441
Excuse me, sir.

16:47.484 --> 16:48.529
Do you have a lighter?

16:48.572 --> 16:50.748
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

16:52.837 --> 16:55.449
You really thought you
were gonna fool somebody.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.290
Oh my God, oh my God.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.075
Oh my God.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.165
I'm gonna kill you.

17:21.127 --> 17:23.781
Open the door, open it, now.

17:28.917 --> 17:29.700
He tried to get me.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.224
Who tried to get you?

17:31.267 --> 17:31.920
They're coming to get me,
they're coming to get me.

17:31.963 --> 17:32.964
Oh, please, save me.

17:33.008 --> 17:35.837
No one's coming to get you,
Eva.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.361
They're coming right
now, they're coming.

17:38.405 --> 17:39.188
They're coming to get me.

17:39.232 --> 17:41.016
Oh please, save me.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.148
They're coming to get me.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.719
They're coming to get.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.566
There isn't any more food.

18:57.266 --> 18:59.268
Should I go to the
store and buy something?

19:11.628 --> 19:13.369
I'm going with you.

19:17.417 --> 19:18.244
Thanks.

19:41.789 --> 19:43.007
Do you have any weapons?

19:43.051 --> 19:43.965
Yes, but they're

19:44.008 --> 19:44.835
- for protection.
- Give it to me.

19:44.879 --> 19:45.967
No.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.186
Then you cannot come into my
store.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.100
We're just trying to buy food.

19:49.144 --> 19:50.145
Do you have any weapons?

19:50.189 --> 19:51.015
No.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.933
You may come in, but not the
other.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.142
How much is this bread?

20:31.186 --> 20:32.013
39.99.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.151
Where's the food?

20:40.195 --> 20:40.978
A loaf of bread costs 40
bucks.

20:41.022 --> 20:42.153
What?

20:42.197 --> 20:43.067
Yeah, we should burn his store
down.

20:43.111 --> 20:44.417
The next one's six miles down,

20:44.460 --> 20:47.855
but I refuse to walk that far
here.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.556
Gus Hefferson?

20:54.731 --> 20:56.864
I found it on the body of some
dead guy.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.259
Just use the money.

22:00.449 --> 22:01.320
Eva.

22:03.974 --> 22:04.975
I'm so sorry.

22:05.019 --> 22:06.368
I'm sorry.

22:06.412 --> 22:10.111
I was so hungry, please,
please forgive me, please.

22:10.154 --> 22:13.984
Sorry, I was so hungry.

22:14.028 --> 22:16.117
Please don't be mad, please.

22:16.160 --> 22:20.121
Please don't be mad, please,
please.

22:20.164 --> 22:22.471
Please don't be mad at me,
please.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.692
Studies show that
approximately one-fourth

22:25.735 --> 22:27.476
of all mankind has been killed

22:27.520 --> 22:29.435
in the last couple of months.

22:29.478 --> 22:32.786
Wars, hunger, and unexplainable
deaths are

22:32.829 --> 22:34.962
to blame for this catastrophe.

22:35.005 --> 22:37.617
The newly elected world
leader's heart grieves

22:37.660 --> 22:40.010
for those people, and he vows to
work

22:40.054 --> 22:43.057
harder than ever to bring
world peace and unity.

22:44.058 --> 22:45.842
We are coming up with a way

22:45.886 --> 22:48.410
to enhance security for your
safety.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.630
We plan to come up with a system

22:50.673 --> 22:52.849
to protect you from ATM fraud,

22:52.893 --> 22:55.591
enhance airport security from
terrorists,

22:55.635 --> 22:58.377
for schools, for medical care,
for voting,

22:58.420 --> 23:00.074
even for buying things.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.945
And we believe a chip implant

23:01.989 --> 23:04.252
in each individual is the
solution.

23:04.295 --> 23:07.342
We are working diligently
to bring this to pass

23:07.386 --> 23:10.040
and to make sure every human
receives one.

23:10.084 --> 23:12.260
That way, we will be able to
locate

23:12.303 --> 23:15.176
and track down the criminals
quicker.

23:15.219 --> 23:17.396
We are doing everything we can

23:17.439 --> 23:20.529
to provide food from the
least to the greatest.

23:21.487 --> 23:25.012
I understand that we are
all facing difficult times,

23:25.055 --> 23:27.057
but I give you my word,

23:27.101 --> 23:29.059
we will all get through this
together.

24:03.006 --> 24:04.660
I'm gonna rob the grocery
store on the corner.

24:04.704 --> 24:06.009
If you want to come, you can.

24:13.495 --> 24:14.975
I'll shoot the store owner.

24:25.681 --> 24:27.378
The door, it's open.

24:51.098 --> 24:52.795
I think I found the store
owner.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.280
I told you I'd find you.

26:10.351 --> 26:11.134
You all right?

26:11.178 --> 26:11.961
No.

26:13.049 --> 26:13.963
Brian?

26:14.007 --> 26:14.790
Yeah, it's me.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.183
You know him?

26:16.226 --> 26:17.271
Yeah, he's one of my
neighbors.

26:17.314 --> 26:18.620
We gotta get that knee patched
up,

26:18.664 --> 26:20.448
or else it'll get infected.

26:20.491 --> 26:21.492
Come on.

26:49.172 --> 26:50.870
Christians, I see.

26:50.913 --> 26:53.220
No, Boss, injuries.

26:53.263 --> 26:54.569
- Injuries?
- Yeah.

26:56.092 --> 26:58.965
You mean you revealed our
secret place to strangers

26:59.008 --> 27:00.880
because of an injury?

27:00.923 --> 27:02.795
What was I supposed to do, let
her die?

27:02.838 --> 27:04.840
I told you time and time
again,

27:04.884 --> 27:06.537
not to bring strangers here.

27:06.581 --> 27:08.757
And you still will not listen.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.541
What must I do, kill you, too?

27:12.152 --> 27:13.501
I got an idea.

27:13.544 --> 27:14.633
I mean, we should just
teach him a lesson, Boss.

27:14.676 --> 27:15.851
Okay, wait, hold on, hold on,
guys.

27:17.897 --> 27:20.987
What if we use them to
get to the Christians?

27:22.728 --> 27:23.642
Think about it.

27:23.685 --> 27:24.512
Come on.

27:27.733 --> 27:31.475
We can use them to seed the
Christians

27:31.519 --> 27:34.043
into showing us where their
hiding places are, huh?

27:34.957 --> 27:35.784
Hold on.

27:39.875 --> 27:42.704
You're a smart boy, very smart
boy.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.054
Mason, give the girls whatever
they need.

27:47.491 --> 27:49.842
Go, go.

27:51.017 --> 27:53.106
They're coming to get me.

27:53.149 --> 27:53.933
They're coming to get me.

27:53.976 --> 27:56.065
They're coming to get me.

27:57.066 --> 27:59.678
Forgive her, she's been
through a lot.

28:00.766 --> 28:01.941
What's wrong with you?

28:06.249 --> 28:08.556
She will be put on the streets
tonight.

28:08.599 --> 28:09.644
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't you
think

28:09.688 --> 28:10.471
it's a little soon for her?

28:10.514 --> 28:11.167
No, men,

28:12.603 --> 28:13.822
escort this young woman to a
room

28:13.866 --> 28:15.389
and show her what she must do.

28:16.390 --> 28:19.349
The rest of you, put on your
clothes.

28:19.393 --> 28:22.135
We are going out for
a night on the street.

29:29.463 --> 29:31.595
For Jesus, thank you, Lord.

29:31.639 --> 29:34.076
The Lord has protected us.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.513
I've never seen so many
animals eat and attack humans.

29:36.557 --> 29:38.428
I mean, the Scripture
said it would happen,

29:38.472 --> 29:39.429
and so it has.

29:39.473 --> 29:40.822
What Scriptures?

29:40.866 --> 29:41.692
The Bible.

29:42.519 --> 29:43.694
Are you a new believer?

29:45.044 --> 29:47.350
Yeah, sort of.

29:48.351 --> 29:52.007
Well, let me warn you about
something.

29:53.400 --> 29:56.098
They're gonna come and remove
all the Bibles from the Earth.

29:57.143 --> 29:59.362
They're gonna destroy them, burn
them.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.409
So go out and grab as many as
you can.

30:02.452 --> 30:03.627
Careful who you talk to.

30:03.671 --> 30:04.672
Do not trust anybody.

30:04.715 --> 30:07.457
They hate you with a passion.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.460
If you don't remember
anything else I tell you,

30:10.504 --> 30:14.682
remember this: do not take
the mark of the beast.

30:14.725 --> 30:16.466
The mark of the beast?

30:16.510 --> 30:18.817
It's the number, 666.

30:20.122 --> 30:21.515
The Bible says a man's gonna
come and rule the world

30:21.558 --> 30:23.604
for several years, and he's
going to make everybody,

30:23.647 --> 30:26.128
no matter how small or great,
worship him

30:26.172 --> 30:29.740
and receive the mark,
666, on their forehead,

30:29.784 --> 30:31.003
on their right hand.

30:31.046 --> 30:34.180
Those that do are gonna
go to hell forever.

30:34.223 --> 30:37.270
There's no forgiveness, no
second chances.

30:37.313 --> 30:39.228
So go out and warn as
many people as you can,

30:39.272 --> 30:40.751
not to receive the mark.

30:41.883 --> 30:43.406
When will this man rule the
world?

30:43.450 --> 30:44.973
You'll find out in good time.

30:46.105 --> 30:46.932
Let's go.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.768
And held a bolt, and
he was given a crown,

30:57.812 --> 31:02.034
and he rode out as a
conqueror bent on conquest.

31:04.950 --> 31:05.776
Hey, everyone.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.520
She's a new believer in Christ.

31:10.564 --> 31:11.826
She was in search of other
Christians,

31:11.870 --> 31:14.176
so I said I'd introduce her to
all of us.

31:14.220 --> 31:16.004
- Hey, I'm Bev.
- Hi.

31:16.048 --> 31:18.224
We're going over the
Book of Revelations.

31:18.267 --> 31:20.095
Do you have a Bible?

31:20.139 --> 31:20.966
No.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.011
All right, don't worry about
it.

31:23.055 --> 31:23.882
We got plenty of them here.

31:26.406 --> 31:27.842
Yeah, you can keep it.

31:28.843 --> 31:29.670
Thank you.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.020
Okay, where was I?

31:32.064 --> 31:33.543
Revelations 6.

31:33.587 --> 31:34.718
Yes.

31:34.762 --> 31:37.069
When the lamb opened the second
seal,

31:37.112 --> 31:40.115
I heard the second living
creature say, "Come."

31:40.159 --> 31:43.423
Then another horse came
out, a fiery red one.

31:43.466 --> 31:45.642
His rider was given
the power to take peace

31:45.686 --> 31:48.776
from the Earth and to
make men slay each other.

31:48.819 --> 31:51.257
To him was given a large sword.

31:51.300 --> 31:52.693
Samantha?

31:52.736 --> 31:54.651
When the Lamb opened the third
seal,

31:54.695 --> 31:57.480
I heard the third living
creature say, "Come."

31:57.524 --> 32:00.048
I looked, and there before
me was a black horse.

32:00.092 --> 32:03.225
Its rider was holding a
pair of scales in his hand.

32:03.269 --> 32:05.749
Then I heard what sounded like
a voice

32:05.793 --> 32:08.056
among the four living creatures
saying,

32:08.100 --> 32:10.102
"A cord of wheat for a day's
wages,

32:10.145 --> 32:12.495
"and three quarts of
barley for a day's wages.

32:12.539 --> 32:15.107
"And do not damage the oil and
the wine."

32:15.150 --> 32:17.022
When the Lamb opened the
fourth seal,

32:17.065 --> 32:20.112
I heard the voice of the fourth
living creature say, "Come."

32:20.155 --> 32:22.984
I looked, and there before
me was a pale horse.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.464
Its rider was named Death,

32:24.507 --> 32:26.988
and Hades was following close
behind him.

32:27.032 --> 32:29.164
They were given power
over a fourth of the Earth

32:29.208 --> 32:31.950
to kill by sword, famine, and
plague,

32:31.993 --> 32:33.429
and by the wild beasts of the
Earth.

32:33.473 --> 32:34.953
When he opened the fifth seal,

32:34.996 --> 32:37.042
I saw under the altar the souls

32:37.085 --> 32:39.958
of those who had been slain
because of the word of God

32:41.002 --> 32:42.961
and the testimony they had
maintained.

32:43.004 --> 32:45.572
And they cried with
a loud voice, saying,

32:45.615 --> 32:49.010
"How long, oh Lord, holy and
true,

32:49.054 --> 32:50.794
"until you judge and avenge our
blood

32:50.838 --> 32:53.232
"on those who dwell on the
Earth."

32:53.275 --> 32:56.452
Then a white robe was
given to each of them,

32:56.496 --> 32:58.977
and it was said to them
that they should rest

32:59.020 --> 33:00.630
a little while longer,

33:00.674 --> 33:03.633
until both the number
of their fellow servants

33:03.677 --> 33:06.201
and their brethren, who would be
killed

33:06.245 --> 33:08.638
as they were, was complete.

33:08.682 --> 33:11.032
I looked when he opened the
sixth seal,

33:11.076 --> 33:14.079
and behold, there was a great
earthquake,

33:14.122 --> 33:17.430
and the sun became black as
sapphire.

33:17.473 --> 33:20.302
And the moon became like blood.

33:20.346 --> 33:22.348
And the stars of heaven.

33:45.588 --> 33:48.113
Kill them, kill them all.

33:48.156 --> 33:49.027
Kill them.

33:54.380 --> 33:55.207
Kill them.

33:56.556 --> 33:58.123
What are you doing?

34:11.831 --> 34:13.355
All right, shut up.

34:13.399 --> 34:15.922
I want you to shoot
the person next to you.

34:15.966 --> 34:19.969
If you do not, I will kill you.

34:20.014 --> 34:23.452
If you do, I will let you live.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.241
- Shoot her.
- No.

34:34.333 --> 34:35.159
Shoot her.

34:40.991 --> 34:41.862
Shoot her.

34:52.786 --> 34:53.612
Shoot her.

34:57.443 --> 34:59.967
Your tears will do nothing for
you.

35:00.010 --> 35:01.142
Now shoot her.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.146
No.

35:05.190 --> 35:06.365
Give me your hand.

35:13.459 --> 35:17.593
I will keep doing it until you
shoot her.

35:17.637 --> 35:19.291
Shoot her.

35:19.334 --> 35:22.424
Take the gun and shoot her now.

35:47.623 --> 35:49.277
Look what you've done.

35:49.321 --> 35:51.236
You've broken one of your
commandments.

35:51.279 --> 35:54.195
See you in hell.

36:27.576 --> 36:28.925
Hey, you okay?

36:29.883 --> 36:31.319
Am I okay?

36:31.363 --> 36:32.842
Yeah.

36:32.886 --> 36:35.018
How could you be so nice
and caring one minute,

36:35.062 --> 36:36.977
and shoot someone in the head
the next?

36:38.631 --> 36:41.677
Joanna, they're Christians.

36:42.939 --> 36:45.203
They're the reason why
all this is happening.

36:47.074 --> 36:49.250
They don't deserve to live.

36:53.036 --> 36:54.255
You know what?

36:54.299 --> 36:57.345
I'm sorry, but can you just
leave me alone

36:57.389 --> 36:58.694
for a little while?

36:58.738 --> 37:00.827
I need some time to breathe.

37:03.873 --> 37:05.223
Yeah, yeah, okay, sure.

37:09.009 --> 37:11.359
- Want a glass of water?
- No.

37:11.403 --> 37:12.882
I just want to be left alone.

37:46.481 --> 37:48.527
Is that my food?

37:48.570 --> 37:49.658
Get up, get up.

37:52.879 --> 37:53.706
Get up.

37:54.620 --> 37:55.708
Who said you can eat my food?

37:55.751 --> 37:56.578
Hey, stop it.

37:59.625 --> 38:00.452
Drop it.

38:01.975 --> 38:03.846
No, you drop it, drop it.

38:03.890 --> 38:05.283
Drop it, Brian.

38:08.155 --> 38:09.809
Well, look at what we got
here.

38:11.201 --> 38:12.942
I got an idea.

38:12.986 --> 38:14.335
How about we all die?

38:15.249 --> 38:17.599
Just shoot me, I'm serious, I
want to die.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.340
- Shoot me.
- Don't tempt me.

38:19.384 --> 38:21.560
Wait, please have mercy on
her.

38:21.603 --> 38:23.997
I'm begging you, please don't
shoot her.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.215
- Get up.
- I'll get you some food.

38:25.259 --> 38:26.521
Just give me time.

38:27.783 --> 38:29.350
I'll give you five minutes.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.265
To find food?

38:31.309 --> 38:33.223
I need more time than that.

38:36.314 --> 38:37.445
I can't do that.

38:37.489 --> 38:38.316
Time's ticking.

38:39.752 --> 38:40.883
Hurry.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.407
Go.

38:49.022 --> 38:52.373
In a few moments, our
fate will be determined.

39:19.922 --> 39:22.403
Good girl, good girl, Joanna.

39:22.447 --> 39:23.883
She told me to get her food.

39:23.926 --> 39:25.841
She's the one you want.

39:26.668 --> 39:27.756
Stay still.

39:57.569 --> 39:58.831
What's in the bag?

39:58.874 --> 39:59.962
What's in the bag?

40:00.006 --> 40:01.660
Please, don't hurt me, don't
hurt me.

40:32.560 --> 40:33.779
I got the food.

40:33.822 --> 40:34.780
I got the food.

40:34.823 --> 40:35.824
Where's Eva?

40:37.391 --> 40:38.392
Where's Eva?

40:39.828 --> 40:41.090
I got the food.

40:42.701 --> 40:45.007
I got the food, where's Eva?

40:45.051 --> 40:45.878
Follow me.

40:47.140 --> 40:47.923
But I got the food.

40:47.967 --> 40:48.924
Follow me.

40:59.979 --> 41:00.806
Joanna.

41:06.768 --> 41:07.595
Eva.

41:09.423 --> 41:11.860
Joanna, how I missed you.

41:15.385 --> 41:17.083
I missed you, Joanna.

41:19.781 --> 41:22.044
I want all of you to leave,

41:22.088 --> 41:24.830
Brian, you too.

41:24.873 --> 41:29.661
If I ever see any of you
again, I will kill you.

42:09.657 --> 42:11.572
Well, at least we have a
radio.

42:11.616 --> 42:14.575
Maybe it works, maybe it
doesn't.

42:14.619 --> 42:15.620
Hopefully it works.

42:22.148 --> 42:22.975
Of course not.

42:43.256 --> 42:45.911
I wonder what happened to
the family that lived here.

42:59.968 --> 43:02.623
Why do you keep
carrying that book around?

43:02.667 --> 43:03.493
What book?

43:04.930 --> 43:06.975
That big brown thing
sticking out of your pocket.

43:17.290 --> 43:19.814
What if what was happening
was written in this book?

43:19.858 --> 43:21.468
What do you mean?

43:21.511 --> 43:23.513
In the meeting, we were
reading it,

43:23.557 --> 43:26.081
and the exact same
things that were written

43:26.125 --> 43:27.648
in this book are happening now.

43:27.692 --> 43:29.432
Is that the Bible?

43:29.476 --> 43:30.477
What if it's true.

43:30.520 --> 43:31.434
Joanna, it's not.

43:31.478 --> 43:33.001
No, think about it, Fay.

43:33.045 --> 43:34.655
What if the next event that
is said to happen, happens?

43:34.699 --> 43:36.048
What if it does?

43:41.793 --> 43:43.533
And I beheld when he had
opened the sixth seal,

43:43.577 --> 43:45.492
and lo, there was a great
earthquake.

43:45.535 --> 43:47.842
And the sun became black
as sackcloth of hair

43:47.886 --> 43:49.496
and the moon became as blood.

43:49.539 --> 43:51.585
And the stars of heaven
fell onto the Earth

43:51.629 --> 43:54.588
even as a fig tree
casteth her untimely figs,

43:54.632 --> 43:56.242
when she is shaken of a mighty
wind.

43:56.285 --> 43:57.809
And heaven departed as a
scroll...

43:57.852 --> 43:59.071
Joanna!

43:59.114 --> 43:59.941
Stop it.

44:09.734 --> 44:13.607
Soon it will not be him over
here,

44:13.651 --> 44:14.608
and him over there.

44:15.740 --> 44:18.307
No more war and fighting.

44:18.351 --> 44:20.266
It will be peace.

44:20.309 --> 44:22.485
We will all be one,

44:22.529 --> 44:25.663
one nation, one people,

44:25.706 --> 44:30.668
one currency, one government,
one voice.

44:40.590 --> 44:42.723
Make sure you grab
anything of importance.

45:24.112 --> 45:25.853
What are you reading?

45:29.596 --> 45:30.858
What are you reading, huh, huh?

45:30.902 --> 45:32.947
- Huh?
- Brian, please.

45:32.991 --> 45:34.079
Why are you trying to hide it
from me?

45:34.122 --> 45:35.384
- Brian.
- What?

45:35.428 --> 45:38.736
Joanna, did you find
any money in the book?

45:41.347 --> 45:42.609
Then throw the book away,

45:42.652 --> 45:44.089
and look in the next one.

45:50.530 --> 45:53.011
I always heard people kept money
in books,

45:53.054 --> 45:56.710
so I told her to go
look through the books.

46:01.584 --> 46:03.935
You weren't really going to
shoot her.

46:10.855 --> 46:12.204
Why are you so against
Christians?

46:16.904 --> 46:19.515
You're so stupid, that
it doesn't make any sense.

46:21.517 --> 46:22.344
Don't you see?

46:23.693 --> 46:25.783
This has nothing to do
with the Christians.

46:26.871 --> 46:29.656
Christians is just a code name.

46:32.572 --> 46:34.748
They're aliens.

46:39.884 --> 46:43.365
And they're the reason for all
of this.

46:45.237 --> 46:46.847
But this is just the beginning.

46:47.848 --> 46:50.808
Soon their king will come down

46:50.851 --> 46:54.550
on clouds from the sky and
destroy us all.

46:55.856 --> 46:57.162
You may not believe me now,

46:58.337 --> 47:02.950
but you will, you all will.

47:04.430 --> 47:08.651
That's why we've got to unite
and fight.

47:11.916 --> 47:13.134
And if she's gonna be reading
that mess,

47:14.440 --> 47:16.224
she's gonna become one of them,

47:17.312 --> 47:18.748
and she's gonna destroy us.

47:20.925 --> 47:24.232
And that's why we've got
to destroy them first.

47:27.496 --> 47:28.628
That book is poison.

47:31.849 --> 47:33.459
We can't let that poison spread.

48:01.313 --> 48:02.314
I'm sorry.

48:06.013 --> 48:07.928
Brian has really gone crazy.

48:07.972 --> 48:10.322
He was talking about Christians
and aliens

48:10.365 --> 48:12.324
and how they've come back

48:12.367 --> 48:13.673
and how we must destroy them.

48:14.892 --> 48:16.676
Now go and find.

48:22.943 --> 48:23.770
Who you guy talking about?

48:27.121 --> 48:30.298
I was talking to her
about those Christians

48:30.342 --> 48:31.909
that we must destroy,

48:31.952 --> 48:35.260
and we made a vow to make sure

48:35.303 --> 48:38.306
that every single one
of them is annihilated.

48:48.273 --> 48:50.666
Finish getting the stuff.

49:00.415 --> 49:02.983
We have got to leave now.

49:46.940 --> 49:48.942
Hey.

49:48.986 --> 49:49.812
Hey.

49:55.470 --> 49:56.384
Whoa, whoa.

49:57.777 --> 49:59.735
Get lost.

50:01.433 --> 50:02.521
All right, listen, old man.

50:02.564 --> 50:03.391
I'm not going to hurt you.

50:03.435 --> 50:04.653
All I want is a smoke.

50:06.438 --> 50:08.222
You ain't getting nothing from
me.

51:05.758 --> 51:06.585
Joanna.

51:07.716 --> 51:08.543
Fay.

51:47.974 --> 51:49.236
We got away from Brian,

51:49.280 --> 51:51.282
but it was hard to
figure out our next move.

51:58.158 --> 52:00.334
Eva was due to have a baby any
day.

52:01.640 --> 52:02.815
Turn it off.

52:03.990 --> 52:05.774
She was having a hard time
following.

52:05.818 --> 52:07.254
I think we need to leave her.

52:07.298 --> 52:08.125
What, no.

52:09.343 --> 52:11.867
I don't trust, you don't trust
anyone.

52:11.911 --> 52:13.173
They didn't trust her,

52:13.217 --> 52:14.479
and she thought we should leave
her.

52:14.522 --> 52:16.698
She was trying to
lie on you to lose God.

52:16.742 --> 52:17.917
I couldn't do such a thing.

52:17.960 --> 52:19.179
I'm not leaving her.

52:23.183 --> 52:24.489
And in the midst of it all,

52:25.838 --> 52:27.709
when nothing seemed to work out
right,

52:27.753 --> 52:30.147
the strangest thing happened.

52:32.192 --> 52:33.541
Joanne?

52:33.585 --> 52:34.977
Who are you?

52:37.241 --> 52:39.765
I ran into my brother Evan.

52:44.465 --> 52:45.379
You okay?

52:56.825 --> 52:59.219
He happened to find an
abandoned house in the forest

52:59.263 --> 53:01.178
and was staying there for
shelter.

53:11.362 --> 53:13.190
Eva gave birth to a beautiful
baby,

53:13.233 --> 53:15.496
which became more of an
issue than we thought.

53:18.282 --> 53:20.240
We weren't capable of
caring for ourselves,

53:20.284 --> 53:21.198
let alone a baby.

53:22.808 --> 53:24.331
You're holding her wrong, Eva.

53:26.812 --> 53:29.641
It's okay, it's all right,
Baby.

53:30.729 --> 53:32.644
It's fine, you're good.

53:34.123 --> 53:35.864
Good baby, hey, yeah.

53:38.911 --> 53:42.044
Evan was really good
with creating electricity.

53:42.088 --> 53:43.698
He knew how to wire things
together

53:43.742 --> 53:46.440
and create an electrical
current.

53:46.484 --> 53:47.746
Oh, it's a match.

53:47.789 --> 53:49.313
Or it's you finding a
way to hack the system

53:49.356 --> 53:50.966
and steal electricity.

53:51.010 --> 53:53.230
Don't get mad at me because
I'm the brains of the family.

53:53.273 --> 53:55.275
He had all the lights turned
on.

53:55.319 --> 53:57.451
He even had the television.

53:57.495 --> 53:58.278
I can't believe you're doing
so well.

53:58.322 --> 53:59.236
Yeah, I know.

54:00.585 --> 54:01.586
It's a miracle I found this
place,

54:01.629 --> 54:02.804
but the only reason it's so good
is

54:02.848 --> 54:04.284
because it's far from the city.

54:04.328 --> 54:05.894
This place would've been any
closer,

54:05.938 --> 54:07.331
it wouldn't have been any good.

54:09.681 --> 54:11.987
Oh, did you hear about
that nuclear explosion?

54:12.901 --> 54:13.728
No.

54:14.860 --> 54:16.340
Wiped out everything moving.

54:18.994 --> 54:20.909
How did you hear about it?

54:20.953 --> 54:21.823
Oh, we got a television in the
back.

54:21.867 --> 54:23.477
Oh, we're high rollers, huh.

54:23.521 --> 54:25.436
Yeah, you know we're live in
the luxury.

54:25.479 --> 54:27.046
Oh look, check this out.

54:27.089 --> 54:28.656
You can take off your coat, too.

54:34.749 --> 54:36.360
As I continued to read,

54:36.403 --> 54:38.971
I began to see the comparisons
between the scriptures

54:39.014 --> 54:41.495
and the things that began
to happen in reality.

54:42.540 --> 54:43.932
It fascinated me.

54:45.369 --> 54:46.935
After the seventh seal was
opened,

54:46.979 --> 54:48.633
seven trumpets resound.

54:50.417 --> 54:54.334
In Revelations 6, when the
seven trumpets were to sound,

54:54.378 --> 54:57.555
hail, fire, and blood
were thrown on the Earth.

54:58.643 --> 55:01.254
One third of the trees were
burnt up,

55:01.298 --> 55:03.125
and all of the green grass was
burnt.

55:04.257 --> 55:06.912
One third of the sea became
blood,

55:06.955 --> 55:08.348
and on the second trumpet,

55:08.392 --> 55:10.568
one third of the
creatures in the sea died.

55:11.960 --> 55:14.746
And one third of all the
ships were destroyed.

55:18.924 --> 55:20.273
A great sword from heaven called
Wormwood

55:20.317 --> 55:22.362
fell on the rivers and fountains
of water.

55:23.798 --> 55:25.539
And many men died of bitter
waters.

55:26.801 --> 55:30.457
Wormwood, the star of
wormwood fell onto the waters

55:30.501 --> 55:32.372
and made it bitter.

55:32.416 --> 55:33.895
And many men died.

55:35.636 --> 55:37.725
One third of the moon and one
third

55:37.769 --> 55:39.423
of the stars was darkened.

55:40.424 --> 55:42.208
One third of the day was dark.

55:43.209 --> 55:45.211
And one third of the night was
no light.

55:48.040 --> 55:49.650
And many things began to happen.

55:51.173 --> 55:52.827
It's never been this dark.

55:55.787 --> 55:58.093
And a star fell from
heaven to the Earth,

55:58.137 --> 56:00.182
and an angel opened the
bottomless pit.

56:01.358 --> 56:04.273
And smoke and locusts came
out of the pit onto the Earth

56:04.317 --> 56:06.188
to torment men that didn't have

56:06.232 --> 56:08.843
the seal of God on their heads.

56:08.887 --> 56:11.106
They would torment men for five
months.

56:12.238 --> 56:14.936
Men would desire to die, but
death would flee from them.

56:14.980 --> 56:16.111
Come on.

56:16.155 --> 56:17.112
It should be right here.

56:17.156 --> 56:18.157
The locusts had faces of men,

56:18.200 --> 56:19.854
they had hair of women,

56:19.898 --> 56:21.943
and their teeth were like teeth
of lions.

56:23.075 --> 56:24.076
Do you hear that?

56:24.119 --> 56:25.294
Hear what?

56:25.338 --> 56:26.165
That.

56:27.862 --> 56:29.255
Which?

56:29.298 --> 56:30.387
They had tails like scorpions,

56:30.430 --> 56:32.127
and their stings were in their
tails.

56:33.172 --> 56:36.697
And with it, they hurt
men for five months.

56:38.786 --> 56:39.613
Come on.

56:42.050 --> 56:44.662
And the four angels
found in the great river

56:44.705 --> 56:46.446
of Euphrates were loosed,

56:46.490 --> 56:48.492
which were prepared for an hour
a day,

56:48.535 --> 56:50.798
a month, and a year, to kill one
third

56:50.842 --> 56:52.234
of the people on the Earth.

56:53.105 --> 56:54.367
Why can't I die?

56:54.411 --> 56:55.847
I don't want to live anymore.

56:57.501 --> 56:59.503
But those that were
not killed by the plague,

56:59.546 --> 57:02.419
didn't repent of their murders,
sorceries,

57:02.462 --> 57:05.639
magic, sexual fornication, or
thefts.

57:06.858 --> 57:09.338
And God will give power to two
witnesses,

57:09.382 --> 57:11.166
and if any man hurt them,

57:11.210 --> 57:12.777
fire comes out of their mouth.

57:13.952 --> 57:15.910
And he must in this manner be
killed.

57:17.303 --> 57:20.175
They have power to shut
heaven that it wouldn't rain.

57:20.219 --> 57:22.439
And power to turn the waters
into blood,

57:22.482 --> 57:24.049
and smite the Earth with plagues

57:24.092 --> 57:25.659
as often as they will.

57:26.878 --> 57:28.619
But they will be killed.

57:28.662 --> 57:31.404
And the Earth will rejoice
because they tormented them.

57:32.274 --> 57:34.015
But in three and a half days,

57:34.059 --> 57:35.974
the two witnesses will rise from
the dead

57:36.017 --> 57:38.324
and ascend to heaven in a cloud.

57:38.367 --> 57:40.935
And within that hour, a
great earthquake will destroy

57:40.979 --> 57:42.459
one tenth of the city,

57:43.938 --> 57:46.071
and 7,000 people will be killed.

57:46.114 --> 57:48.508
I may seem like I'm
crazy, but it's true.

57:48.552 --> 57:49.901
Why else would I have the
network

57:49.944 --> 57:51.250
and illegally stream this?

57:52.425 --> 57:54.209
I'm risking my life.

57:54.253 --> 57:56.081
If they find me, I'm dead.

57:56.124 --> 57:58.300
I'm not doing this for fun or
attention.

57:58.344 --> 58:00.085
I'm doing this because this is
the truth,

58:00.128 --> 58:02.174
and the world needs to know.

58:02.217 --> 58:03.349
In the last couple weeks,

58:03.392 --> 58:05.525
one third of all mankind was
wiped out,

58:05.569 --> 58:07.919
over two billion people dead.

58:07.962 --> 58:09.790
Where else does it mention that?

58:09.834 --> 58:10.530
Revelation.

58:13.881 --> 58:15.361
Those two men in Israel going
off

58:15.404 --> 58:16.971
at the mouth wearing sackcloth,

58:17.015 --> 58:18.538
they're not just loonies.

58:18.582 --> 58:20.758
They're written in the Bible.

58:20.801 --> 58:22.673
Yes, they're the two witnesses
written

58:22.716 --> 58:24.065
in the Book of Revelation,

58:24.109 --> 58:25.502
and they're destroying all the
Bibles

58:25.545 --> 58:26.894
because they have the truth.

58:30.289 --> 58:33.031
Now I want you all to look at
something.

58:33.074 --> 58:35.076
This was footage taken from a
camera phone

58:35.120 --> 58:36.730
of a young girl that just so
happened

58:36.774 --> 58:39.646
to be in the mob of people
surrounding the two witnesses.

58:41.126 --> 58:42.823
Now I want you all to look
closely,

58:42.867 --> 58:44.129
and look at what happens.

58:46.000 --> 58:46.827
You see that?

58:48.481 --> 58:50.962
That is real fire coming
from their mouths.

58:51.005 --> 58:52.050
Where else does it mention

58:52.093 --> 58:54.008
fire shooting from people's
mouth?

58:54.052 --> 58:55.314
Revelation 11:5.

58:56.707 --> 58:59.840
It says if any man will hurt
them,

58:59.884 --> 59:01.842
the two witnesses, fire will
shoot

59:01.886 --> 59:04.497
from their mouths and
devour their enemies.

59:04.541 --> 59:06.107
It also mentions that these men
will have

59:06.151 --> 59:08.283
the power to shut heaven so it
won't rain.

59:08.327 --> 59:09.981
They can turn the waters into
blood,

59:10.024 --> 59:11.896
and they can smite the Earth

59:11.939 --> 59:13.506
with all plagues as often as
they desire.

59:16.335 --> 59:18.467
I know I'm risking my life,

59:18.511 --> 59:20.600
but the truth must come out.

59:20.644 --> 59:22.341
The world needs to know what is
going on,

59:22.384 --> 59:25.779
because the new world
leader is lying to you all.

59:25.823 --> 59:27.912
He controls all the media, the
television,

59:27.955 --> 59:30.871
the radio, internet,
and every other outlet.

59:30.915 --> 59:33.004
And he's not letting you know
the truth.

59:35.702 --> 59:37.530
Okay, so my time is short,

59:37.574 --> 59:38.749
but I need you all to listen to
me

59:38.792 --> 59:40.141
and hear what I'm saying.

59:40.185 --> 59:41.795
Now I'm not talking about the
witnesses.

59:41.839 --> 59:43.623
Those men are from God,

59:43.667 --> 59:44.972
but the others that are popping
up

59:45.016 --> 59:46.887
all over the city, the
psychics and mediums

59:46.931 --> 59:49.760
and palm readers and magicians
telling you the future.

59:49.803 --> 59:52.023
This crazy talk about aliens

59:52.066 --> 59:54.634
and people trying to
imitate what Jesus did,

59:54.678 --> 59:55.853
turning water into wine

59:55.896 --> 59:58.638
and making things disappear and
reappear.

59:58.682 --> 01:00:00.988
This is not magic.

01:00:01.032 --> 01:00:03.556
This is witchcraft.

01:00:04.557 --> 01:00:06.254
Demons are behind this.

01:00:07.429 --> 01:00:09.170
Demons have controlled these
people.

01:00:09.214 --> 01:00:12.304
Demons are using people to
bring about the demonic plan

01:00:12.347 --> 01:00:14.088
and these demons have a plan for
your life

01:00:14.132 --> 01:00:15.742
and for all mankind.

01:00:15.786 --> 01:00:17.831
The Bible says that if the
days are not cut short,

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:18.876
all will perish.

01:00:19.833 --> 01:00:21.400
None would survive.

01:00:25.534 --> 01:00:27.319
This is not about them.

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:30.627
This is not about doing evil.

01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:33.586
No.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.240
This is about something greater,

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:39.636
something mightier coming to
rule and reign on this Earth,

01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:41.638
and all this stuff happening.

01:00:41.681 --> 01:00:42.856
This is just the vehicle he's
using

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:44.902
to bring about his master plan.

01:00:44.945 --> 01:00:49.950
This is the tool he's using
to usher in his coming.

01:00:50.342 --> 01:00:52.997
He's using this to separate
the sheep from the goats.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.174
Those that are truly his
from those that are not his.

01:00:56.217 --> 01:00:58.698
This is the way that God will
see the ones that are his

01:00:58.742 --> 01:01:00.744
and Satan will see the ones that
are his

01:01:00.787 --> 01:01:02.789
by observing who will worship

01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:06.053
and take the mark, 666, on
their right hand or forehead.

01:01:06.097 --> 01:01:09.361
This is the grand finale, the
ending,

01:01:09.404 --> 01:01:12.320
the climax, the last
part of his master plan.

01:01:12.364 --> 01:01:14.192
This is what we've all been
waiting for.

01:01:14.235 --> 01:01:16.020
The Earth has been growing for
this day,

01:01:16.063 --> 01:01:18.849
the day when the true king is
revealed.

01:01:18.892 --> 01:01:19.937
He is coming.

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:20.981
He's coming, and in
righteousness,

01:01:21.025 --> 01:01:23.375
he is going to judge and wage
war.

01:01:23.418 --> 01:01:24.376
He's coming.

01:01:25.943 --> 01:01:27.118
Are you ready?

01:01:45.353 --> 01:01:46.746
It's going to be okay.

01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:49.444
It'll be okay, I promise.

01:01:49.488 --> 01:01:51.142
It'll be fine.

01:01:53.187 --> 01:01:54.275
Don't worry, sweet baby.

01:01:54.319 --> 01:01:55.146
I promise.

01:02:00.368 --> 01:02:02.675
You guys find any food?

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:03.545
Man, we found nothing.

01:02:08.507 --> 01:02:09.595
The one second we could see
something,

01:02:09.638 --> 01:02:10.901
the next second it was
completely dark.

01:02:10.944 --> 01:02:12.641
No moon, stars, or nothing.

01:02:14.992 --> 01:02:15.862
He's so hungry.

01:02:17.081 --> 01:02:18.822
It's okay, baby, don't worry.

01:02:18.865 --> 01:02:21.650
I haven't eaten anything in
days.

01:02:24.915 --> 01:02:26.612
It's gonna be okay.

01:02:26.655 --> 01:02:27.656
But it wasn't.

01:02:29.223 --> 01:02:32.792
The baby got really sick and
died a couple days after.

01:02:40.365 --> 01:02:43.629
Things went from worse
to becoming unbearable.

01:02:44.848 --> 01:02:46.632
Because all the grass
and trees were burnt up,

01:02:46.675 --> 01:02:48.852
there were few animals left in
the forest.

01:02:50.418 --> 01:02:52.377
Our only option was to go back
to the city

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:54.161
and find a store to buy food
from.

01:02:55.554 --> 01:02:57.338
And there weren't many stores.

01:02:57.382 --> 01:02:58.818
But we found one place
underground

01:02:58.862 --> 01:03:02.213
that was willing to barter
and trade food for goods.

01:03:02.256 --> 01:03:04.041
Evan found a stack of money
underneath one

01:03:04.084 --> 01:03:07.479
of the floorboards, so we
decided to take our chances

01:03:07.522 --> 01:03:08.436
and go to the city.

01:03:09.873 --> 01:03:11.222
It was either we go to the city

01:03:11.265 --> 01:03:12.919
and possibly be killed,

01:03:12.963 --> 01:03:14.965
or wait here and die of hunger.

01:03:16.488 --> 01:03:17.924
We had no choice but to go.

01:03:24.017 --> 01:03:25.018
You here to trade?

01:03:26.933 --> 01:03:28.630
Barter?

01:03:29.718 --> 01:03:30.545
Yeah.

01:03:32.547 --> 01:03:33.418
Back room.

01:04:00.662 --> 01:04:03.317
Well, well, let's see
what you got to work with.

01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:17.505
The money is crap.

01:04:17.549 --> 01:04:18.463
It has no value.

01:04:19.986 --> 01:04:20.857
Don't deal.

01:04:21.814 --> 01:04:23.163
What?

01:04:23.207 --> 01:04:24.382
Where you
been the last two years?

01:04:24.425 --> 01:04:26.732
Throw this stack of paper on the
table.

01:04:26.775 --> 01:04:27.733
Get out of here.

01:04:27.776 --> 01:04:28.690
No deal.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:32.825
Wait a minute.

01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:34.871
Let me see that.

01:04:43.314 --> 01:04:44.619
Is that real gold?

01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:49.189
Yeah, it's real.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.106
Now this I can work with.

01:04:54.803 --> 01:04:58.285
Sit down, make yourselves
comfortable.

01:05:09.253 --> 01:05:10.123
Choose whatever you'd like.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:28.272
You don't have anything on your
forehead.

01:05:29.795 --> 01:05:31.144
Let me see your right hand.

01:05:32.493 --> 01:05:33.886
My hand?

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.981
You don't have anything
on your right hand

01:05:42.025 --> 01:05:44.592
or on your forehead.

01:05:45.898 --> 01:05:46.812
Where's your mark?

01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:49.075
My mark?

01:05:49.119 --> 01:05:50.424
You heard me, your mark.

01:05:52.644 --> 01:05:53.819
What mark?

01:05:53.862 --> 01:05:56.735
No man buys or sells without
the mark.

01:05:56.778 --> 01:05:57.736
Where's your mark?

01:06:02.132 --> 01:06:03.350
Where's your mark?

01:06:03.394 --> 01:06:04.917
I'm so sorry.

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:06.832
Your mark, where is it?

01:06:06.875 --> 01:06:07.659
I don't want to cause any
trouble.

01:06:07.702 --> 01:06:09.052
I just want to go home.

01:06:09.095 --> 01:06:10.705
There won't be a problem
if you've got the mark.

01:06:10.749 --> 01:06:11.532
If you don't have the mark,

01:06:11.576 --> 01:06:13.665
we've got a problem.

01:06:13.708 --> 01:06:15.275
Where's the mark?

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:26.025
It was the first time we
had to shoot and kill a man.

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:27.896
We all believed for years

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:31.683
that these things were
make-believe,

01:06:31.726 --> 01:06:36.731
but now we see that
they are alive and well

01:06:37.906 --> 01:06:41.345
and recruiting people
on Earth to join them.

01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:44.304
Why?

01:06:44.348 --> 01:06:46.480
So they can destroy us.

01:06:48.265 --> 01:06:49.831
Even out of their own mouths,

01:06:50.963 --> 01:06:53.966
they say that their leader is
coming down

01:06:54.967 --> 01:06:57.361
to destroy us all.

01:06:59.276 --> 01:07:04.281
This is why we must join
together.

01:07:07.545 --> 01:07:10.896
Anyone that does not receive the
mark

01:07:12.985 --> 01:07:17.946
and worship the image is against
us.

01:07:21.559 --> 01:07:24.344
And they shall be exterminated.

01:07:29.088 --> 01:07:33.310
They are our enemies,
these two wicked men have

01:07:34.441 --> 01:07:39.446
somehow disappeared after we
killed them.

01:07:40.143 --> 01:07:43.624
They somehow stood on their feet

01:07:43.668 --> 01:07:46.497
and ascended into a cloud.

01:07:47.802 --> 01:07:51.719
After they were dead for
three and a half days,

01:07:51.763 --> 01:07:54.461
for three and a half days,

01:07:54.505 --> 01:07:58.074
their bodies lay dead in the
street.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:01.990
And somehow, after they
disappeared,

01:08:03.209 --> 01:08:07.213
a huge earthquake destroyed
a tenth of our cities.

01:08:09.215 --> 01:08:14.090
Sadly, 7,000 men were killed.

01:08:17.267 --> 01:08:19.921
This is no act of God.

01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:22.707
As I've warned you before,

01:08:23.925 --> 01:08:26.014
these are aliens,

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:31.411
aliens that tried to
sneak down onto the Earth

01:08:31.455 --> 01:08:34.761
to destroy mankind, but failed.

01:08:36.198 --> 01:08:41.160
These men somehow flew
into the sky on a cloud.

01:08:45.991 --> 01:08:47.819
They are not from here.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:54.260
That is why we must
destroy them at all costs.

01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:59.309
Anything associated with
it must be annihilated,

01:08:59.657 --> 01:09:01.876
starting with the Christians.

01:09:02.747 --> 01:09:06.751
Anyone who does not receive the
mark

01:09:06.794 --> 01:09:11.015
or worship the statue is against
us.

01:09:11.059 --> 01:09:15.673
We are now offering
bags of silver and gold

01:09:16.542 --> 01:09:21.548
for anyone who reveals to us the
infidels

01:09:21.853 --> 01:09:24.072
who will not accept the mark

01:09:24.116 --> 01:09:25.813
and worship the statue.

01:09:26.901 --> 01:09:31.906
We will not stop until
we have rid the Earth

01:09:32.951 --> 01:09:34.386
of all infidels.

01:09:43.962 --> 01:09:45.616
Eva, what are you watching?

01:09:45.658 --> 01:09:47.966
Oh, darling, nothing, nothing
at all.

01:09:49.402 --> 01:09:50.969
Nothing.

01:09:51.011 --> 01:09:53.885
Hey, I'm off to bed, off to bed
now.

01:10:26.396 --> 01:10:27.788
The next morning, Eva was
gone.

01:10:31.183 --> 01:10:32.663
Then one day.

01:10:32.706 --> 01:10:34.099
Come on, guys, let's go.

01:10:34.142 --> 01:10:36.884
They're through this grove.

01:10:36.928 --> 01:10:38.669
Everything changed.

01:10:40.061 --> 01:10:40.975
Hurry up.

01:10:41.933 --> 01:10:43.630
They're right there.

01:10:43.674 --> 01:10:46.851
They're in the house.

01:10:56.774 --> 01:10:59.951
They're just asleep, come on.

01:10:59.994 --> 01:11:02.214
Hurry up, let's go.

01:11:03.911 --> 01:11:06.827
In the house that's over there.

01:11:21.799 --> 01:11:23.757
Evan, Fay, get up.

01:11:23.801 --> 01:11:24.628
Someone's here.

01:11:24.671 --> 01:11:25.455
- What?
- Someone's here.

01:11:25.498 --> 01:11:26.891
Who?

01:11:29.763 --> 01:11:30.764
This can't be happening right
now.

01:11:30.808 --> 01:11:31.591
Here, look here, take a gun.

01:11:31.635 --> 01:11:32.418
No.

01:11:32.462 --> 01:11:33.289
- Take a gun.
- No!

01:11:34.377 --> 01:11:36.379
This can't be happening right
now.

01:11:36.422 --> 01:11:37.467
I want it to end.

01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:39.382
This can't be happening right
now.

01:11:39.425 --> 01:11:40.426
This can't be happening right
here.

01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:41.297
Look, calm down.

01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:42.646
Do you want to live?

01:11:42.689 --> 01:11:43.516
I don't want to die.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.257
Now stop that and come on.

01:12:35.046 --> 01:12:37.135
Oh, no fair, we walked.

01:12:43.881 --> 01:12:45.491
You go.

01:12:45.535 --> 01:12:49.626
They're back there, just go
and stop standing here and go.

01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:50.496
Go.

01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:52.324
You don't want to.

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:54.370
Nobody here now.

01:12:54.413 --> 01:12:55.632
All right, guys, clear out.

01:12:58.722 --> 01:12:59.549
You promised me money.

01:12:59.592 --> 01:13:00.767
I want the money.

01:13:02.465 --> 01:13:04.292
You promised me money.

01:13:07.818 --> 01:13:10.037
I want money, you, you.

01:13:12.344 --> 01:13:13.214
You promised me money.

01:13:13.258 --> 01:13:16.087
I want my money, my money, yes.

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:17.523
Yes.

01:13:17.567 --> 01:13:18.829
Wait.

01:13:18.872 --> 01:13:19.786
Give it to me now.

01:14:15.973 --> 01:14:20.064
Please don't kill, please
don't kill me.

01:14:21.152 --> 01:14:23.459
Well, there you guys are.

01:14:24.982 --> 01:14:28.333
You know, I was just thinking
about that cold, dark,

01:14:28.376 --> 01:14:30.857
and depressing day when you left
me

01:14:30.901 --> 01:14:33.077
in that sad and lonely house.

01:14:35.296 --> 01:14:37.037
You know, I think it's kind of
funny

01:14:37.081 --> 01:14:39.387
we keep running into each other.

01:14:44.567 --> 01:14:45.785
Okay, where's your mark?

01:14:57.188 --> 01:14:58.494
They're still just stupid.

01:15:11.463 --> 01:15:12.377
You almost hit me.

01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:15.336
What?

01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:19.166
Hey, hey, hey.

01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:20.428
Yo, she's mine.

01:15:21.778 --> 01:15:25.172
Well, I don't see her name on
you.

01:15:31.962 --> 01:15:33.224
Get off.

01:15:33.267 --> 01:15:36.183
This piece of vomit is a
Christian.

01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:38.272
Will you accept the mark?

01:15:39.317 --> 01:15:40.753
Will you worship Jethro?

01:15:41.972 --> 01:15:42.973
Answer me yes or no.

01:15:48.239 --> 01:15:50.589
If I accept the mark, I'll
worship him,

01:15:50.633 --> 01:15:53.766
he'll return the temple of fire
forever.

01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:55.463
- Answer me.
- No.

01:15:55.507 --> 01:15:58.162
No, I won't accept the mark.

01:15:58.205 --> 01:15:59.032
No, no!

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:02.035
Stop.

01:16:04.821 --> 01:16:08.346
You will not hurt her, not now.

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:13.656
Why would we do that

01:16:16.136 --> 01:16:17.660
and spoil all the fun?

01:17:35.389 --> 01:17:36.216
You're next.

01:17:38.044 --> 01:17:39.219

In the Bible, it talked about
a beast,

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:55.867
which had seven heads and ten
horns.

01:21:57.738 --> 01:22:00.306
And one of his heads was wounded
to death,

01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:01.655
but his wound was healed.

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:05.007
And the Earth worshiped the
beast.

01:22:06.225 --> 01:22:08.706
He blasphemed God and made war

01:22:08.749 --> 01:22:11.665
with the saints of God and
overcame them,

01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:13.841
because power was given to him.

01:22:13.885 --> 01:22:17.367
There will be no more gods,
no.

01:22:19.847 --> 01:22:23.764
Never again will religion
show its ugly, dividing face.

01:22:24.896 --> 01:22:26.637
Today is a new day.

01:22:27.594 --> 01:22:29.857
There is one God.

01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:36.255
This day the world will
know that I am God.

01:22:38.475 --> 01:22:41.957
All of you will fall and
worship me, and me alone.

01:22:43.175 --> 01:22:46.048
And anyone who is against what I
speak

01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:49.616
shall be sentenced to death.

01:22:51.749 --> 01:22:53.969
Here's the patience and faith
of saints.

01:22:56.710 --> 01:22:59.061
And another beast came
and made the Earth worship

01:22:59.104 --> 01:23:02.629
the first beast, and he received
the Earth

01:23:02.673 --> 01:23:05.850
and performed many
miracles and made fire come

01:23:05.893 --> 01:23:07.243
from heaven in front of men.

01:23:08.374 --> 01:23:10.028
And they made an image of the
beast,

01:23:11.029 --> 01:23:12.422
and they gave life to the image

01:23:12.465 --> 01:23:14.946
so that the image could speak.

01:23:16.208 --> 01:23:17.818
And anyone that didn't worship
the beast

01:23:17.862 --> 01:23:20.125
or receive the mark would be
killed,

01:23:21.039 --> 01:23:24.564
but whoever did receive the
mark, 666,

01:23:24.608 --> 01:23:27.437
or worshiped the beast, would be
tormented

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:29.961
with fire and brimstone forever
and ever.

01:23:30.875 --> 01:23:32.485
After the seven trumpets were
sound,

01:23:32.529 --> 01:23:36.576
seven vials of God's wrath
were poured onto the Earth.

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:38.404
Painful sores came upon the
people

01:23:38.448 --> 01:23:41.277
that had the mark of the
beast and worshiped him.

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:44.106
The sea, the rivers and
fountains,

01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:45.846
became as the blood of a dead
man.

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:48.893
And every living soul in the sea
died.

01:23:49.937 --> 01:23:51.722
God gave them blood to drink

01:23:51.765 --> 01:23:54.420
because of the righteous
souls they killed.

01:23:54.464 --> 01:23:58.076
God gave the sun power
to scorch men with fire

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.078
that had blasphemed him.

01:24:00.122 --> 01:24:02.385
Yet the men still refused to
repent.

01:24:03.908 --> 01:24:08.086
And the kingdom of the
beast, that wicked leader,

01:24:08.130 --> 01:24:09.479
was full of darkness.

01:24:10.436 --> 01:24:11.655
And they gnawed their tongues

01:24:11.698 --> 01:24:13.613
because of the painful sores
they had.

01:24:15.224 --> 01:24:17.095
And the spirit of devils went
throughout the whole world

01:24:17.139 --> 01:24:19.184
to gather men to the battle of
Armageddon.

01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:21.882
And there was a great
earthquake,

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.885
the greatest and most fierce
earthquake

01:24:24.929 --> 01:24:26.539
since men's existence on Earth.

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:31.762
And the great city of Babylon
was divided into three parts.

01:24:33.024 --> 01:24:36.636
And great hail, weighing 60 to
100 pounds,

01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.247
fell from heaven upon them.

01:24:39.683 --> 01:24:42.555
And Babylon, that great city,
shall fall.

01:24:43.469 --> 01:24:45.297
In one hour, her judgment shall
come.

01:24:46.907 --> 01:24:51.695
In one day, death, mourning,
famine, plague shall come,

01:24:51.738 --> 01:24:54.132
and she shall be burnt with
fire.

01:24:54.176 --> 01:24:56.047
For strong is the Lord who judge
her.

01:24:57.266 --> 01:24:58.528
In her was found the blood of
prophets,

01:24:58.571 --> 01:25:01.487
saints, and all that were slain
on Earth.

01:25:03.054 --> 01:25:05.143
And the marriage of the lamb
will come,

01:25:06.405 --> 01:25:08.364
and the heavens will open.

01:25:08.407 --> 01:25:10.844
And he that sat came
riding on a white horse,

01:25:10.888 --> 01:25:13.586
and his name is called faithful
and true.

01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:16.111
And in righteousness,
he judges and makes war.

01:25:17.286 --> 01:25:19.853
His eyes are a flame of
fire and many crowns.

01:25:19.897 --> 01:25:23.727
He has a name written that
no man knows, but he himself.

01:25:23.770 --> 01:25:26.295
He is clothed with a
vesture dipped in blood.

01:25:27.209 --> 01:25:29.211
And his name is called the word
of God.

01:25:30.168 --> 01:25:33.084
And the armies in heaven
followed him on white horses,

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:34.520
white and clean.

01:25:35.826 --> 01:25:37.828
And out of his mouth
shoots a two-edged sword,

01:25:38.785 --> 01:25:40.135
that he would smite the nations

01:25:40.178 --> 01:25:42.006
and rule them with a rod of
iron.

01:25:42.963 --> 01:25:44.791
And his name on his clothing and
thigh is

01:25:44.835 --> 01:25:46.706
king of kings and lord of lords.

01:25:47.968 --> 01:25:52.538
And this world leader, who
we will call the beast,

01:25:52.582 --> 01:25:54.671
and all the kings of the
Earth and their armies

01:25:54.714 --> 01:25:57.282
gathered together to make war
against him

01:25:57.326 --> 01:25:59.850
that sat on the white horse and
his army.

01:25:59.893 --> 01:26:01.547
And the beast and the false
prophet,

01:26:01.591 --> 01:26:03.158
which deceived the world, were
taken

01:26:03.201 --> 01:26:06.204
and cast alive into the burning
lake of fire and brimstone.

01:26:07.249 --> 01:26:08.946
And the rest of the army was
slain

01:26:08.989 --> 01:26:10.165
with the sword that came out

01:26:10.208 --> 01:26:12.210
of the rider on the white
horse's mouth.

01:26:13.124 --> 01:26:15.431
And all the birds were
filled with their flesh.

01:26:16.823 --> 01:26:19.217
Satan was cast by an angel
into the bottomless pit

01:26:19.261 --> 01:26:21.263
for a thousand years.

01:26:21.306 --> 01:26:23.439
And the souls that were beheaded
for the witness of Jesus

01:26:23.482 --> 01:26:26.790
which had not worshiped
the beast, his image,

01:26:26.833 --> 01:26:29.749
or received his mark, reigned
with Christ

01:26:29.793 --> 01:26:31.186
for a thousand years.

01:26:32.230 --> 01:26:34.406
This is the first resurrection.

01:26:35.625 --> 01:26:38.193
After the thousand years,
Satan will be loosed.

01:26:39.324 --> 01:26:41.326
And he will again gather
the deceived nation

01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:43.937
for battle against the
saints and the beloved city.

01:26:45.504 --> 01:26:47.289
And fire from God shall come
from heaven

01:26:47.332 --> 01:26:48.203
and devour them.

01:26:49.552 --> 01:26:51.423
And the devil will be cast into
the lake

01:26:51.467 --> 01:26:54.034
of fire to be tormented forever
and ever.

01:26:55.427 --> 01:26:57.255
And a great white throne will
appear.

01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:00.911
And he who sat on it,
from whose face heaven

01:27:00.954 --> 01:27:03.174
and Earth fled away, will be
there.

01:27:04.523 --> 01:27:07.918
And dead, small and great,
will stand before God.

01:27:09.354 --> 01:27:10.660
And the books will be opened.

01:27:11.704 --> 01:27:12.923
That is the book of life.

01:27:14.533 --> 01:27:17.797
And the dead will be judged
according to the works they did.

01:27:17.841 --> 01:27:20.539
And death and hell will be
cast into the lake of fire,

01:27:21.888 --> 01:27:24.021
and a new heaven and a new Earth
appeared.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.677
The first heaven and
Earth and sea passed away.

01:27:29.331 --> 01:27:32.072
And a holy city, his bride,
will come down from heaven.

01:27:33.509 --> 01:27:36.555
And the tabernacle of
God will be with men,

01:27:36.599 --> 01:27:37.948
and he will live with them.

01:27:39.863 --> 01:27:42.474
And God will wipe away
the tears from their eyes.

01:27:42.518 --> 01:27:44.389
And there shall be no more
death,

01:27:44.433 --> 01:27:47.392
nor sorrow, nor crying, nor
pain.

01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:50.743
For God makes all things new.

01:27:50.787 --> 01:27:53.093
These words are faithful and
true.

01:27:53.964 --> 01:27:54.791
It is done.

01:27:55.748 --> 01:27:58.316
Behold, I come quickly.

01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:00.579
Blessed is he that keepeth the
sayings

01:28:00.623 --> 01:28:03.147
of the prophecy of this book.

01:28:03.190 --> 01:28:05.454
Behold, I come quickly.

01:28:05.497 --> 01:28:07.456
And my reward is with me

01:28:07.499 --> 01:28:10.850
to give every man according
to his work shall be.

01:28:12.069 --> 01:28:14.376
I am the alpha and omega,

01:28:14.419 --> 01:28:16.726
the beginning and the end,

01:28:16.769 --> 01:28:19.555
the first and the last.

01:28:19.598 --> 01:28:22.209
Blessed are they that do his
commandments,

01:28:22.253 --> 01:28:25.387
that they may have right
to the tree of life,

01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:28.085
and may enter in through
the gates into the city.

01:28:28.912 --> 01:28:30.957
But without our dogs and
sorcerers

01:28:31.001 --> 01:28:34.178
and whoremongers and
murderers and idolaters,

01:28:34.221 --> 01:28:36.659
and whosoever loved to make a
lie.

01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:39.662
I, Jesus, have sent my angel

01:28:39.705 --> 01:28:43.100
to testify unto you these
things in the churches.

01:28:43.143 --> 01:28:45.929
I am the root and the offspring
of David,

01:28:45.972 --> 01:28:47.757
the bright and morning star.

01:28:49.106 --> 01:28:52.022
Let the spirit and
the bride say, "Come."

01:28:52.065 --> 01:28:53.980
And let him that hears say,
"Come."

01:28:54.851 --> 01:28:57.288
And let him that of thirst,
come.

01:28:57.332 --> 01:28:59.943
Even so, come Lord Jesus, come.

01:29:01.118 --> 01:29:01.945
Amen.
