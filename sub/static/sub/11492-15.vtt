01:43.058 --> 01:44.559
Okay, Dave and I

01:44.560 --> 01:46.644
had the same education,
the same skills.

01:46.645 --> 01:48.646
We even started our practice
at the same time.

01:48.647 --> 01:50.715

the business that I do.

01:50.716 --> 01:51.849

01:57.489 --> 01:59.523
Is that another way
of saying happy ending?

01:59.524 --> 02:01.192
No, no, it means
newspaper ads,

02:01.193 --> 02:03.194
flyers, radio spots.

02:03.195 --> 02:04.295
Since Dave
started doing it,

02:04.296 --> 02:05.696
his business has been
through the roof.

02:05.697 --> 02:08.299
How much is this
going to cost me?

02:08.300 --> 02:09.400
No, no. The question is:

02:09.401 --> 02:11.235
how much is it
going to earn you?

02:11.236 --> 02:13.438
I'll stick with my question.

02:13.439 --> 02:16.924
Charlie, I am willing to let
you get in on the ground floor

02:16.925 --> 02:18.976

business opportunity.

02:18.977 --> 02:20.945

Alan.

02:22.614 --> 02:23.748

02:23.749 --> 02:26.083
For two, I can have you buried
in the desert

02:26.084 --> 02:28.569
and still have three

02:29.621 --> 02:30.688
Although, to be honest,

02:30.689 --> 02:32.073
that would just be
gilding the lily.

02:32.074 --> 02:34.158

02:34.159 --> 02:35.960

Wow, a second patient.

02:38.831 --> 02:40.331

02:40.332 --> 02:42.867

rolling in, I can move out.

call it going out.

I'm sorry.

♪ Men. ♪

18:53.114 --> 18:54.681
Unbelievable!

18:54.682 --> 18:58.118
You ask for money,
and they just give it to you.

18:58.119 --> 18:59.853
And then you take the new money

18:59.854 --> 19:02.906
and use it to pay back
some of the old money.

19:02.907 --> 19:04.408
But they don't want it back.

19:04.409 --> 19:06.493
And they give you more.

19:06.494 --> 19:07.961
'Cause they're greedy.

19:07.962 --> 19:10.898
Greedy, greedy, greedy, greedy.

19:12.550 --> 19:14.551
Oh, God, what have I done?

Oh, quit your whining.

19:17.572 --> 19:19.206
Who said that?

Over here.

19:24.612 --> 19:25.846
Hi.

19:25.847 --> 19:27.147
How you doing?

19:27.148 --> 19:29.149
Not so good.

19:33.688 --> 19:35.856
Feeling better?

19:37.025 --> 19:39.076
This isn't happening.

19:39.077 --> 19:40.727
I'm losing my mind.

19:40.728 --> 19:42.162
Your mind is fine.

19:42.163 --> 19:45.099
What you should be worried about
is losing your hair.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.036
Now, do yourself a favor
and stop with the guilt.

19:49.037 --> 19:50.170
How?

19:50.171 --> 19:51.338
I'm betraying my friends.

19:51.339 --> 19:52.840
I'm betraying my family.

19:52.841 --> 19:54.708
Feels good, doesn't it?

19:54.709 --> 19:56.576
Yes. No!

19:56.577 --> 19:58.846
I'm... well, I'm not sure.

19:58.847 --> 20:01.448
Oh, come on. You've spent
your whole life being a doormat.

20:01.449 --> 20:04.101
This is your chance
to finally get what you deserve.

20:04.102 --> 20:05.452
But what about the guilt?

20:05.453 --> 20:06.887
The hell with the guilt.

20:06.888 --> 20:08.922
Let's be bad guys.

20:08.923 --> 20:10.891
Bad guys?

20:10.892 --> 20:12.759
It's time for a change,
don't you think?

20:13.928 --> 20:16.730
Could we grow a mustache?

20:16.731 --> 20:19.500
I've always wanted a mustache.

20:19.501 --> 20:22.035
We're going to grow balls.

20:22.036 --> 20:24.338
Oh, good.

I've always wanted those, too.
