00:00.200 --> 00:03.435
    I stand before you
    today a broken man.

00:03.437 --> 00:04.970
    As you may have heard,

00:04.971 --> 00:07.172
        My son preston
        was kidnapped.

00:07.174 --> 00:08.741
            Welcome to korban,
            preston.

00:08.743 --> 00:12.211
            It's time for you to
            pay for the sins
            of your father.

00:12.213 --> 00:15.581
    But why choose kingston
    tanner as your target?

00:15.583 --> 00:17.249
Oh, no, no.
He chose me.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.485
            Kingston on tv:
            Joe carroll
            is waging war

00:19.487 --> 00:21.954
            Against religion,
            against god.

00:21.956 --> 00:23.856
I can kill you,

00:23.858 --> 00:26.025
Or you can kill
for me.

00:26.027 --> 00:28.794
    Carrie: "diner lights
    flashing pink on your skin."

00:28.796 --> 00:29.862
            No, no, no, no.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.296
    "your breath
    on my shoulder."

00:31.298 --> 00:33.699
Living in the shadows
is no way to live.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.334
I want to finish this.

00:35.336 --> 00:36.168
            How?

00:36.170 --> 00:37.336
By killing joe.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.204
        I don't care
        who you kill,

00:39.206 --> 00:40.606
    But bring joe to me.

00:40.608 --> 00:41.874
You definitely
came alone.

00:41.876 --> 00:43.609
Otherwise,
I'd be dead by now.

00:43.611 --> 00:44.710
            You will be soon.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.779
    We've got vehicles
    at the front entrance.

00:46.781 --> 00:48.881
            We have to go now.

00:53.486 --> 00:56.822
        Mike...
        You're a good man.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.424
        Put the gun down.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.559
            You're wrong, lily.
            I used to be.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.895
Don't do this!

01:14.240 --> 01:16.975
            Thank you so much
            for the ride, ma'am.

01:16.977 --> 01:19.711
            I'm sorry we had to
            hijack your car
            like this,

01:19.713 --> 01:21.680
            But we were
            pretty desperate.

01:21.682 --> 01:24.249
            Uh, sorry. I didn't
            get your name.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.318
    Mark: It's trisha.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.920
    It's trish brumell.

01:27.922 --> 01:29.888
Trisha, as soon
as we find our mother,

01:29.890 --> 01:30.956
You can have
your car back,

01:30.958 --> 01:32.257
And we'll be on our way.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.193
        She's dead, luke.
        Mother's dead.

01:34.195 --> 01:37.596
No. No, she's not.
She's just resting is all.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.364
        She's dead.
        They shot her.

01:39.366 --> 01:40.566
            Don't listen
            to him, trisha.

01:40.568 --> 01:41.800
            He gets these
            ideas in his head.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.635
    Trisha's dead, too!

01:43.637 --> 01:45.237
    They're both dead!

01:45.239 --> 01:47.473
        [tires squeal]

01:57.584 --> 02:00.152
            Is mother
            really dead?

02:01.888 --> 02:03.989
        Yes, luke.

02:06.092 --> 02:08.560
            Then they're
            gonna pay.

02:08.562 --> 02:12.898
            Mike, ryan,
            joe carroll--

02:12.900 --> 02:15.567
            They're all
            gonna pay.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.046
Man: Ok. So, um,
let's just--let's just

02:28.048 --> 02:30.516
Go over this
one more time, please.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.683
    Lily gray had a gun.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.852
    She pointed the gun
        at me,

02:33.854 --> 02:35.220
        Weston fired.

02:35.222 --> 02:36.522
            Agent weston, is
            this the, uh--

02:36.524 --> 02:38.624
            Is this the gun lily
            had in her hand?

02:38.626 --> 02:40.159
    I believe so. Yeah.

02:40.161 --> 02:41.793
        And, uh,
        detective hardy,

02:41.795 --> 02:44.096
        Where were you
        during this whole
        altercation?

02:44.098 --> 02:46.298
    Ryan: I told you.
    I was ahead of her.
    She hadn't arrived yet.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.133
    She didn't see him
    discharge his--

02:48.135 --> 02:52.804
    Detective, could you
    answer the question, please?

02:52.806 --> 02:54.740
            As ryan stated,
            I fell behind.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.475
            I heard the gunshot,
            but I couldn't see

02:56.477 --> 02:58.277
            Anything
            from my eye line.

02:58.279 --> 03:01.046
You can contact them
through my office, detective,

03:01.048 --> 03:04.316
    If you need
    anything further.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.724
Well, we found
a storeroom full
of weapons and explosives.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.394
It's half-empty,
so where the hell
are they headed?

03:15.396 --> 03:17.196
            Dispatched at least
            40 members

03:17.198 --> 03:18.564
            Just before he left,
            made it pretty clear

03:18.566 --> 03:20.432
            He was planning
            something big.

03:20.434 --> 03:25.404
Ryan, there's something
you need to know
about claire.

03:25.406 --> 03:28.173
She talked
to carrie cooke.

03:28.175 --> 03:30.442
She gave cooke a message
to give to joe

03:30.444 --> 03:32.444
Through her news show.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.612
            What kind
            of message?

03:33.614 --> 03:35.280
A poem of some kind.

03:35.282 --> 03:37.549
Supposed to mean
something to joe.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.084
That's all
she would say,

03:39.086 --> 03:42.521
So you need to talk
to claire.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.558
    Hey. You should go home,
        get some rest.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.227
I'm not going
anywhere.

03:48.229 --> 03:49.828
            Ok. Look. I know
            I've got no right

03:49.830 --> 03:51.530
            To tell you
            what you should
            and shouldn't do--

03:51.532 --> 03:54.066
You're right.
You don't.

03:54.068 --> 03:57.936
What would you have done
if it was joe carroll?

04:00.273 --> 04:02.908
            You're better
            than me.

04:05.044 --> 04:09.348
            [singing]

04:09.350 --> 04:11.650
Man: This was found
in the backyard.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.852
Someone threw it
over the fence.

04:13.854 --> 04:17.656
There's a note attached
with your name.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.863
It's a burner phone.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.332
No contacts
or messages.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.934
Should I give it
to the fbi?

04:28.936 --> 04:31.203
            No, roman.
            I'll take it,
            thank you.

04:31.205 --> 04:33.272
Yes, sir.

04:35.508 --> 04:38.844
    "update america" reporter
    and author carrie cooke

04:38.846 --> 04:40.245
    Is making headlines today

04:40.247 --> 04:43.615
    After she recited
    a rather cryptic message

04:43.617 --> 04:45.384
    On her show last night.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.819
    "diner lights flashing
    pink on your skin.

04:47.821 --> 04:51.056
        "your breath
        on my shoulder.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.057
    Me, I could die happy."

04:52.059 --> 04:54.059
    Reporter: Cooke began her
    broadcast by saying

04:54.061 --> 04:56.228
    That the message
    was for joe carroll,

04:56.230 --> 04:59.498
        But so far no one
        has been able...

05:00.667 --> 05:01.900
Ryan: What were you
thinking?

05:01.902 --> 05:04.102
You trying to get
yourself killed
and carrie?

05:04.104 --> 05:06.972
        Carrie? No. Carrie
        was just doing her job.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.273
You put her in jeopardy.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.175
Joe has reached out
to her several times.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.411
        Look. I'm sorry, ok,
        but you disappeared
        on me,

05:12.413 --> 05:13.612
        And I didn't know
        what else to do.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.580
        I had to do something.
        I'm--

05:15.582 --> 05:18.717
        I'm going crazy here.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.452
What did
the poem mean?

05:20.454 --> 05:22.487
        It's something that joe
        and I wrote together.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.989
        It's something
        only we know.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.159
So you wanted him to know
you were alive. Why?

05:27.161 --> 05:29.494
        So we can kill
        him, ryan.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.196
No, claire. You're not
thinking clearly.

05:31.198 --> 05:32.864
The man tried
to kill you.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.599
        So then let him
        try again!

05:34.601 --> 05:36.501
        Does he hate me,
        does he still love me?

05:36.503 --> 05:37.903
        It doesn't matter!

05:37.905 --> 05:40.539
        He'll have to see me
        because his ego
        will demand it.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.074
        I know him, ryan.

05:42.076 --> 05:44.409
        We can trap him,
        and we can kill him.

05:44.411 --> 05:46.378
No, no. You need
to go home today.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.880
        I haven't slept
        since I found out
        joe was alive.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.415
        I haven't slept
        for the past year,

05:50.417 --> 05:52.551
        Always looking
        over my shoulder,
        and this will--

05:52.553 --> 05:55.253
        It will never end
        until I know he's dead.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.856
        That's the only way
        I'm gonna know that
        joey and I are safe.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.691
I want the same thing
that you want,

05:59.693 --> 06:02.761
But I can't do
what I need to do

06:02.763 --> 06:04.996
If you're not safe.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.332
I can't be worried
about you.

06:07.334 --> 06:10.902
Please. Please, claire,
you got to go home for me.

06:10.904 --> 06:11.903
            Ryan, I--

06:11.905 --> 06:13.438
You have to trust me!

06:13.440 --> 06:15.941
Ok? The marshals are
waiting to take you,

06:15.943 --> 06:18.777
And when this is over,

06:18.779 --> 06:21.446
I'll find you.

06:21.448 --> 06:24.916
I promise.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.452
I got to go now.

07:25.344 --> 07:27.279
            Uh, any more
            questions?

07:27.281 --> 07:28.113
        No. We're good.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.815
    Just got to pick up
        the others.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.650
                Heh.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.952
            You ok, ange?
            You seem nervous.

07:33.954 --> 07:37.355
Yes, I am,
but I'm more excited.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.691
I feel blessed
to be chosen, joe.

07:39.693 --> 07:45.397
            I can't tell you
            how grateful I am
            for your dedication.

07:45.399 --> 07:47.432
            Bless you.

07:48.067 --> 07:52.270
I'll see you again
up above.

07:54.907 --> 07:57.742
        [van starts]

08:03.749 --> 08:07.085
            Do you really think
            claire's alive?

08:09.622 --> 08:11.256
"you asleep.

08:11.258 --> 08:14.459
"diner lights flashing
pink on your skin.

08:14.461 --> 08:17.429
Your breath
on my shoulder."

08:17.431 --> 08:20.031
Claire and I wrote that
together

08:20.033 --> 08:21.666
The weekend
I proposed to her.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.503
We memorized it,
we didn't write it
down anywhere.

08:24.505 --> 08:29.007
It was just a silly,
secret poem for us.

08:29.009 --> 08:33.345
            He's using it
            against you to try
            to make you stumble.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.046
Possibly.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.849
You know, if claire
is alive,

08:37.851 --> 08:39.751
Then she's sending
me a message,

08:39.753 --> 08:43.788
And she will be at the inn
in ware county,

08:43.789 --> 08:46.324
Where I proposed to her,
where we wrote that poem.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.326
        Do you know how
        ludicrous that sounds?

08:48.328 --> 08:50.929
        What's waiting there,
        if anything, is a trap.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.597
        That's all this
        can be, joe.

08:52.599 --> 08:55.634
Is it? Is it really
so hard to believe

08:55.636 --> 08:56.835
That she could fake
her death?

08:56.837 --> 09:01.273
I did. She could have been
in protective custody.

09:01.275 --> 09:02.874
Now if she is--

09:02.876 --> 09:04.442
        It doesn't matter.

09:04.444 --> 09:07.479
        If she is alive,
        who cares?

09:07.481 --> 09:09.281
        You had her killed, joe.

09:09.283 --> 09:11.783
        There will not be
        a repeat of last year.

09:11.785 --> 09:16.655
        We stay on course.
        If you're falling
        apart again, I'm done.

09:16.657 --> 09:20.892
If claire is alive,
then she has come
out of hiding

09:20.894 --> 09:23.461
For a very good reason.

09:23.463 --> 09:27.732
Now please, emma, do not
be threatened by her.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.568
I know this is very hard
for you to understand,

09:29.570 --> 09:33.672
But there is a certain
amount of closure

09:33.674 --> 09:36.808
Necessary for me
where this woman
is concerned.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.510
If it's not a trap,

09:38.512 --> 09:42.981
Then I find having her
in our possession
quite beneficial

09:42.983 --> 09:46.818
With regards to,
uh, leverage.

09:46.820 --> 09:50.488
She may well be
the reason

09:50.490 --> 09:52.190
That we are able
to survive

09:52.192 --> 09:57.028
A little while longer
on this earth.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.597
        I just heard
        from tilda.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.731
    Everything's in place.

09:59.733 --> 10:02.367
Robert, there's been
a slight change of plan.

10:02.369 --> 10:05.503
I need you to go
to the ware lake inn.

10:05.505 --> 10:07.238
It will be closed
this time of year,

10:07.240 --> 10:08.873
But emma
will go with you.

10:08.875 --> 10:09.774
            Joe, please--

10:09.776 --> 10:11.242
Emma will explain
everything.

10:11.244 --> 10:14.112
Do not put yourselves
in danger.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.816
Just observe,
see if it is a trap,

10:17.818 --> 10:20.719
And then call me
when you find anything out.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.988
We'll rendezvous tonight.

10:22.990 --> 10:28.393
Now let's crack on.
We have much to do.

10:29.695 --> 10:32.697
            Kingston:
            You--you saw my son?
            He was alive?

10:32.699 --> 10:35.967
Yeah, he was.
Joe took him.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.435
            Was, uh--
            was he hurt?

10:37.437 --> 10:41.339
He was scared but holding up
under the circumstances.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.241
            Those circumstances
            were...

10:43.243 --> 10:45.710
    You--you may be
    a target, as well,
    mr. Tanner,

10:45.712 --> 10:48.246
    So I've assigned agents
    for your protection.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.547
            No. My personal
            security detail's

10:49.549 --> 10:51.783
            More than sufficient
            to protect me
            and my family,

10:51.785 --> 10:54.052
Joe carroll told me
that he was going to

10:54.054 --> 10:55.887
Create a spectacle, ok?

10:55.889 --> 10:58.556
You need to stay here
at home with your wife.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.792
    Mike: You need to get
    the people out front
    to leave.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.862
            Those people out
            front are members
            of my church.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.130
            They've come to
            pray with me.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.731
            I cannot ask them
            to leave.

11:06.733 --> 11:07.866
I can.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.168
Keep making a show of this,
and you will die.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.437
Do you understand me?

11:12.439 --> 11:14.272
            Do you value
            faith, mr. Hardy?

11:14.274 --> 11:15.707
            Do you even believe
            in god?

11:15.709 --> 11:19.477
And you need to start
acting like you have some.

11:19.479 --> 11:22.647
    [cell phone vibrating]

11:25.384 --> 11:27.619
            If you'll excuse me.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.390
    This is kingston tanner.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.992
            Carroll:
            Yes, kingston.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.695
            Exactly who I wanted
            to speak to.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.163
Where's my son?

11:38.165 --> 11:41.866
            How many people
            are on this call,
            kingston?

11:41.868 --> 11:43.601
No--no one. Just me.

11:43.603 --> 11:46.805
            Good. Then
            if you can follow
            my directions,

11:46.807 --> 11:51.242
            They will lead you
            to your son.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.310
I'm listening.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.379
            Soon you will
            receive a sign.

11:54.381 --> 12:01.186
            Upon that sign,
            do exactly as I say.

12:10.362 --> 12:12.864
These idiots think
prayer's gonna save
tanner's son.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.266
Doesn't work that way.

12:31.884 --> 12:35.220
    Angela: Praise joe!

12:37.490 --> 12:41.826
        Ohh! Aah! Aah!

12:41.828 --> 12:44.429
        [screaming]

12:44.431 --> 12:47.766
        That's the sign.
        We have to leave now.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.201
Ryan: Everybody, get back!

12:50.203 --> 12:52.470
    All right, everybody move!

12:52.472 --> 12:54.506
Get back!

13:01.814 --> 13:03.214
            No.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.150
    You have to stay here.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.986
May god be
with you, sir.

13:16.929 --> 13:19.831
            Get in.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.900
    Where's my son?

13:39.953 --> 13:42.554
            Let robert be
            the hero today.

13:42.556 --> 13:46.090
            You are not to
            endanger yourself.

13:46.092 --> 13:48.893
            Do you understand
            what I'm saying
            to you?

13:48.895 --> 13:51.229
There are so many
things that could go
wrong today, joe.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.530
I should really be
with you.

13:52.532 --> 13:57.001
            Yeah. Everyone plays
            their part, em.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.170
            This is what I need
            from you.

13:59.172 --> 14:04.042
        Please just--just
        do this for me, yeah?

14:04.044 --> 14:06.744
Of course I will.

14:06.746 --> 14:10.782
        Everything's
        so different now.

14:10.784 --> 14:12.917
        I'm no longer blinded
        with the love

14:12.919 --> 14:16.187
        I thought I had
        for claire.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.724
        I am utterly
        devoted to you.

14:21.560 --> 14:25.530
        When all this is over,

14:25.532 --> 14:28.233
        When we are dead

14:28.235 --> 14:32.770
        And immortalized
        for all eternity,

14:32.772 --> 14:37.508
        The world will look
        to you and know

        And it will always--
        always be you.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.034
Ryan: Where's tanner?

15:03.036 --> 15:05.403
Your job is to protect him,
not to lose him.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.738
            We didn't lose
            anyone.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.306
            He asked us
            to stand down.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.307
            He left out
            the back.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.109
And you're telling me
that you have no idea

15:11.111 --> 15:12.010
Where he went?

15:12.012 --> 15:13.878
            Pastor tanner is
            my employer.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.648
            He tells me
            to let him go,
            I let him go.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.416
He took a phone call
earlier. Who was it?

15:18.418 --> 15:19.617
            I don't know
            anything about that.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.619
You're lying.
It was joe carroll.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.321
You know exactly
what is going on.

15:23.323 --> 15:26.925
There is no way
you would let him
walk out of here.

15:28.494 --> 15:30.662
Unless you had a plan
to follow him.

15:30.664 --> 15:32.363
        You saw
    what happened outside.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.798
    Joe carroll has more
    followers just like that.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.200
    They're gonna kill tanner,
    they're gonna kill his son,

15:36.202 --> 15:37.468

    more people.

where they are
and other people die,

to the wall.

            on mr. Tanner.

15:47.781 --> 15:52.951

            but I had to
            do something.

            Are you ok?

19:04.777 --> 19:08.980
            You haven't said
            much since we left.

to do when we find claire?

19:11.951 --> 19:15.353
            If we find claire,
            he said you knew
            what to do.

19:15.355 --> 19:18.556
He said nothing else
to you

About where we go
afterwards or what to do?

            but...

            What's wrong?

19:26.232 --> 19:27.798

            joe betraying us?

19:27.800 --> 19:33.137
No. No. It's not that.
I tru--I trust joe.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.074
            But what if he
            doesn't make it

19:37.076 --> 19:39.210
Out of the church?

19:39.212 --> 19:43.247
            Then death will be
            his way out.

19:43.249 --> 19:45.249
Do you really
believe that?

19:45.251 --> 19:48.986
        I believe that death
        is just the beginning.

19:48.988 --> 19:51.489
            Yeah.

19:51.491 --> 19:54.926
            What do you think
            death is?

Silence.

no more lying

Or fighting, killing.

just stops.

And there's
only silence.

20:18.218 --> 20:21.652
At least I hope
that's what it is.

20:27.659 --> 20:28.993
Let's do another sweep
around the inn,

20:28.995 --> 20:32.863
Make sure
no one's watching.

20:43.442 --> 20:45.309
            Put the gun down!

20:45.311 --> 20:46.544
You can't go in there.

20:46.546 --> 20:47.845
            Put it down now!

20:47.847 --> 20:49.947
This church belongs
to joe carroll.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.415
If anyone tries to enter,

20:51.417 --> 20:53.751
We'll burn it
to the ground.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.353
Death does not scare us.

20:55.355 --> 20:59.323
Death is what we seek.

20:59.325 --> 21:00.224
            Hey!

21:00.226 --> 21:03.294
    [hostages screaming]

21:03.296 --> 21:05.096
        Mike: Hey. Fbi!

21:05.098 --> 21:06.464
        All right. Swat
    and fbi are on the way.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.733
    Joe carroll and his
    followers are believed
        to be inside

21:08.735 --> 21:09.767
    Along with hostages.

21:09.769 --> 21:10.768
    Do you understand?

21:10.770 --> 21:11.769
        Call whoever
        you have to.

21:11.771 --> 21:12.970
        Ryan, where are
        you going?

21:12.972 --> 21:13.971
I need to get inside.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.139
        Swat's on its way.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.574
Yeah, I hear them.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.709
You stay here,
tell them I went in.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.544
            Nice try. Come on.

21:20.546 --> 21:23.447

Stop, stop, stop!

22:30.450 --> 22:32.016
Agh!

22:37.356 --> 22:40.491
        Clarke: We're estimating
        there's at least 100
        hostages inside,

22:40.493 --> 22:43.694
        But we need intel,
        so find ryan.

22:47.899 --> 22:49.166
Mike:
I don't see joe.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.434
            We got to get
            closer.

22:50.436 --> 22:53.237
    [cell phone vibrating]

22:54.439 --> 22:55.373
            We're in.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.908
Ryan: Yeah. Mike and I
got in before they

22:57.910 --> 22:58.743
Locked it down.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.211
        Hostage rescue is
        ready to come in,

23:00.213 --> 23:02.179
    But joe's people cut
    the cctv system.

23:02.181 --> 23:03.914
    We can't see anything
        out here.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.182
I'll try to get it
back on,

23:05.184 --> 23:06.317
But tell clarke no moves.

23:06.319 --> 23:07.385
They wired the place.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.587
Gonna see what kind
of explosives they have.

23:09.589 --> 23:12.623
Get atf ready.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.525
        Be caref--

23:21.400 --> 23:22.633
            Ah, preston.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.235
        Dad!

23:27.038 --> 23:28.706
            Did they hurt you?
            Are you all right?

23:28.708 --> 23:31.075
I'm so sorry, dad.
I'm sorry.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.077
            No, son. You've
            done nothing wrong.

23:33.079 --> 23:36.747
Carroll: Phew.
Shall we show him?

23:36.749 --> 23:39.617
        No, no. Please.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.719
            Show me what?

23:41.721 --> 23:45.756
"proverbs" 22:6
tells us to

23:45.758 --> 23:48.993
"train up your child
the way he should go,

23:48.995 --> 23:52.096
And when he gets old,
he will not depart from it."

23:52.098 --> 23:54.231
Now you trained up
your child

23:54.233 --> 23:57.601
On the teachings
of your god, is that right?

23:57.603 --> 24:00.104
Well, let's see
just how well

24:00.106 --> 24:03.808
Those teachings stuck.

24:06.578 --> 24:08.846
    I'm so sorry.

24:08.848 --> 24:12.750
            [woman grunting]

24:12.752 --> 24:18.155
            No! No!

24:18.157 --> 24:19.256
            Aah!

24:19.258 --> 24:20.758
        I'm sorry, dad.
        I'm sorry.

24:20.760 --> 24:24.895
Your son's morality
disappeared in a--pff--

24:24.897 --> 24:26.931
In an instant.

24:26.933 --> 24:29.066
He was so
easily influence.

24:29.068 --> 24:34.905
Do you see where your
limitations are,
preacher man?

24:34.907 --> 24:39.176
Where is your god now

24:39.178 --> 24:43.214
When you needed
him most?

24:43.216 --> 24:46.383
Oh. Wait. I know.

24:46.385 --> 24:48.385
He's nowhere

24:48.387 --> 24:52.857
Because he does
not exist.

24:55.093 --> 24:58.829
Whereas I, kingston,

24:58.831 --> 25:02.733
I'm very much
a reality.

Keep an eye on the door.

25:28.160 --> 25:31.161

back online.

25:31.163 --> 25:32.296
Tilda: Going live.

25:32.298 --> 25:33.864
    Good evening, everyone.

25:33.866 --> 25:38.702
    In a moment, I'm going to
    give you a lasting legacy

25:38.704 --> 25:40.504
        Of my time here.

25:40.506 --> 25:43.941
    Here with us tonight
    is pastor kingston tanner

25:43.943 --> 25:46.944
    And his handsome son
        preston.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.646
        "why kingston?"
        you may ask.

25:48.648 --> 25:53.384
    It could have been any
    rich megachurch evangelical,

25:53.386 --> 25:56.086
    But kingston tanner
    struck my fancy.

25:56.088 --> 25:59.757
    Now kingston tanner has
    testified from his pulpit

25:59.759 --> 26:03.627
        That his god
        brings salvation.

26:03.629 --> 26:06.931
        Now tonight,
    I am gonna prove to you

26:06.933 --> 26:08.699
    That he is a liar

26:08.701 --> 26:10.134
    And that the greatest
    story ever told

26:10.136 --> 26:12.436
        Is, in fact,
    the greatest lie ever told

26:12.438 --> 26:16.774
    Because--and here's
    the nub of it--

26:16.776 --> 26:21.445
        There is no god.

26:21.447 --> 26:23.981
        There is only me.

at a church.

We need to go live now.

    Carroll: Kingston,
I am gonna offer you a choice.

26:36.362 --> 26:39.163
    You can either pray
to your god to save your son,

26:39.165 --> 26:43.200
        Or you can bow
        and pray to me.

26:43.202 --> 26:47.838
    Which of us do you think
        has more power

26:47.840 --> 26:52.042
    To save preston's life?

            Please don't kill
            my son.

27:11.831 --> 27:15.432
    No. I'm gonna have
    to hear you say,

27:15.434 --> 27:18.636
    "god does not exist,"

27:18.638 --> 27:22.740
    And then throw in
a "praise joe" for good measure.

27:22.742 --> 27:26.076
    Could you do a closeup
    of this, my love?

27:30.582 --> 27:32.983
            There is no god.

27:35.020 --> 27:41.458
            Please, joe,
            save my son.

27:41.460 --> 27:44.294
    No. I really thought
    you were going to do it

27:44.296 --> 27:46.163
    With more enthusiasm
    than that, kingston.

27:46.165 --> 27:49.466
            I did what
            you asked!

27:50.969 --> 27:53.470
            Please
            let my son go.

27:53.472 --> 27:57.174
    Oh. Oh. I'm sorry.
Were you under the impression

27:57.176 --> 27:58.642
    That this was all over?

27:58.644 --> 28:01.912
        No. My mistake.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.914
        No. There's more,

28:03.916 --> 28:06.250
        A lot more,

28:06.252 --> 28:08.085
        And now...

28:10.155 --> 28:13.323
    I'm gonna show you--
        come on--

28:13.325 --> 28:16.427
    How easy it is...

28:16.429 --> 28:17.294
                Ohh!

        Two lives.

28:31.377 --> 28:34.344
    Kill or be killed,

28:34.346 --> 28:37.848
    And if neither of them
        can kill,

28:37.850 --> 28:40.984
    Then they both die.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.855
            And...Go.

29:04.476 --> 29:07.478
        No, no, preston.

29:07.480 --> 29:10.380
    That is not an option.

29:16.421 --> 29:17.821
Ryan, take a look.

29:17.823 --> 29:21.625
Those canisters--
are they gas, nitrogen?

29:21.627 --> 29:24.294
        Clarke said he
        found a stockpile
        of explosives

29:24.296 --> 29:25.929
        At the compound.

29:25.931 --> 29:30.334
They mean business.

29:30.336 --> 29:32.469
        Is there sound?

29:35.173 --> 29:37.875
Kingston: Joe...

29:37.877 --> 29:39.109
I forgive you.

29:39.111 --> 29:43.781
        I don't need
    your forgiveness, kingston.

29:43.783 --> 29:48.118
    I need your decision.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.155
        Now, please.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.400
            Preston:
            Please, dad.
            Tell me what to do.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.135
            I don't know
            what to do.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.136
    Carroll: Yes, dad.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.972
    What does the greedy
    little preacher

30:08.974 --> 30:12.409
        Advise his son?

30:12.411 --> 30:17.581
Greed? Is that what this
is all about, my greed?

30:17.583 --> 30:18.982
I've sinned.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.684
I've sinned.
I'm not perfect,

30:20.686 --> 30:26.690
But my heart
is filled with god.

30:26.692 --> 30:30.127
Good will win here today.
You will see.

30:30.129 --> 30:32.496
Good will always win

30:32.498 --> 30:35.799
Against a monster
of evil.

30:39.137 --> 30:42.039
The lord is
forgiveness.

30:50.181 --> 30:52.416
The lord is forgiveness.

30:52.418 --> 30:53.984
You must never
forget that.

30:53.986 --> 30:56.920
You must forgive yourself.

30:56.922 --> 30:59.456
I love you, preston.

30:59.458 --> 31:00.457
            Dad, no!

    [people screaming]

31:01.660 --> 31:03.493
            No, dad!

31:03.495 --> 31:06.129
        Somebody
        do something!

Emma: She came alone.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.253
            It could still
            be a trap.

31:29.255 --> 31:30.787
Not unless they're
watching from space.

31:30.789 --> 31:34.725
We've checked.
There's no one else here.

31:34.727 --> 31:37.327
            So what do we do?

31:38.997 --> 31:41.098
We get her.

31:50.608 --> 31:52.442
        Ok, ryan.
    We have a live feed.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.878
            There's
            a west entrance
            to the sanctuary

31:54.880 --> 31:57.514
            And a side entrance
            on the north side.

31:57.516 --> 31:58.382
How many explosives?

31:58.384 --> 32:00.450
            It's hard to tell.
            We'll take a look.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.085
            I wouldn't storm
            in here right now.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.888
            Looks like they got
            the doors tripwired.

32:04.890 --> 32:06.256
Hey. Forget
the exploratory.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.457
We can end this now.

32:07.459 --> 32:08.425
We go in,
I cover you.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.761
You take the shot
at joe no matter what,

32:10.763 --> 32:11.495
Kill him.

32:11.497 --> 32:12.663
            And they trigger
            the canisters,

32:12.665 --> 32:14.064
            And the whole place
            goes up.

32:14.066 --> 32:16.066
            A hundred hostages?
            We can't risk it.

32:16.068 --> 32:18.035
            You need to
            stop this.

32:18.037 --> 32:18.936
            This isn't you.

32:18.938 --> 32:21.138
Ok. We'll do it
your way.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.539
            Hey.

32:22.541 --> 32:23.707
            Don't be
            this person.

32:23.709 --> 32:28.679
            It will not end
            well for you,
            trust me.

32:28.681 --> 32:31.281
I won't do
anything stupid.

32:31.283 --> 32:32.683
I promise.

32:32.685 --> 32:36.353
Clarke, internet feed's
back up.

32:38.323 --> 32:39.790
            He's performing
            for the camera.

32:39.792 --> 32:41.358
I thought we shut
this site down.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.126
            Cyber squad shut
            it down 22 times,

32:43.128 --> 32:44.928
            But hackers are
            mirroring it now.

32:44.930 --> 32:46.596
            It's taken on a life
            of its own.

32:46.598 --> 32:50.300
    Carroll: All right.
    Let's, uh--let's resume

32:50.302 --> 32:52.069
    The, uh--the show.

32:52.071 --> 32:53.470
        Pastor tanner
        has clearly made

32:53.472 --> 32:57.674
    A rather shocking
and ultimately fatal decision,

32:57.676 --> 33:00.677
    One that I certainly
    didn't see coming.

33:00.679 --> 33:05.949
    To think that he somehow
    found some humility
    in his final act,

33:05.951 --> 33:09.252
    Yes, I think I know
    what he was going for,

33:09.254 --> 33:12.689
    But, uh, well, given
        the stakes,

33:12.691 --> 33:14.191
    It was rather stupid.

33:14.193 --> 33:18.829
    No. It speaks to me
    more of cowardice

33:18.831 --> 33:21.131
    Than anything else.

33:53.531 --> 33:56.266
        [door creaks]

34:59.163 --> 35:01.031
Hi, claire.

35:01.033 --> 35:02.065
            Stay where you are.

35:02.067 --> 35:04.734
You know how
to use that thing?

35:05.937 --> 35:09.005
            Next shot kills you.

35:09.007 --> 35:12.008
Then who would
take you to joe?

35:13.945 --> 35:15.011
            Where is he?

35:15.013 --> 35:17.114
Relax. He sent me
to get you.

35:17.116 --> 35:18.782
What I want to know is

35:18.784 --> 35:20.417
Why do you want to
see him?

35:20.419 --> 35:21.918
            Well, that's
            between me and joe.

35:21.920 --> 35:25.222
There is
no you and joe.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.256
He wanted you dead.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.558
            And yet here I am.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.327
            Now take me to joe.

35:30.329 --> 35:33.029
It was really stupid
coming here alone.

35:33.031 --> 35:34.598
            Yeah, it was, emma.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.366
            It was extremely
            stupid.

35:36.368 --> 35:37.467
            Something else
            you need to know.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.503
            I'm crazy
            and irrational,

35:39.505 --> 35:41.738
            And I don't care
            what happens
            to me anymore,

35:41.740 --> 35:44.708
            So before
            I put a bullet
            in your brain,

35:44.710 --> 35:47.944
            Tell me,
            where is joe?

35:47.946 --> 35:49.713
How's little joey?

35:49.715 --> 35:50.614
            I will kill you.

35:50.616 --> 35:53.083
            Nothing would
            please me more.

35:55.052 --> 35:56.686
Took you long enough.

35:56.688 --> 35:57.454
                Get up!

35:57.456 --> 35:58.388
She wants to kill joe.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.422
We can't take her back.

35:59.424 --> 36:01.925
    Joe said to call, emma.
        We got to call.

36:01.927 --> 36:04.961
            You hurt me,
            joe will kill you.

36:04.963 --> 36:06.396
        We can't disobey
        joe, emma.

36:06.398 --> 36:08.098
Joe will never know
what really happened.

36:08.100 --> 36:10.433
It was a trap,
we were ambushed,

36:10.435 --> 36:11.401
Claire was killed.

36:11.403 --> 36:12.736
            He's not gonna
            believe you!

36:12.738 --> 36:14.204
Yes, he will, claire.

36:14.206 --> 36:15.205
You had a gun.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.974
You shot robert.
I had to kill you.

36:17.976 --> 36:19.509
        Unh!

36:19.511 --> 36:21.478

    It's over, claire.

36:57.649 --> 37:01.051
    Come out, and I promise
    I'll make it quick.

37:01.053 --> 37:03.987
    It's my turn now, claire.

37:04.789 --> 37:07.057
    You had your chance
        with joe.

37:07.059 --> 37:08.692
    You're not good for him.

37:08.694 --> 37:11.628
    You cause him
    to question himself.

37:11.630 --> 37:14.164
    I can't have that.

37:14.166 --> 37:16.099
    I know you must hate me,

37:16.101 --> 37:17.300
    But I want you to know

37:17.302 --> 37:21.605
    I am so very grateful
    to you, claire.

37:21.607 --> 37:25.942
    I spent two years
    of my life with you.

37:25.944 --> 37:27.811
    We had a family together,

37:27.813 --> 37:31.815
    More than I ever had
    with my own mother.

37:35.319 --> 37:38.655
        Come on, claire!
        It's over!

37:57.341 --> 37:59.109
    Ohh!

            the twist

39:41.980 --> 39:43.313
            I didn't see coming.

            boggles the mind.

you should reveal yourselves,

        start to die.

    yourselves in 5 seconds,

    through his brain.
