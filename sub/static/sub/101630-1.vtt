01:11.788 --> 01:13.999
<i>There are
only two ways to live your life.</i>

01:14.124 --> 01:16.335
<i>One is as though nothing is a miracle.</i>

01:16.460 --> 01:19.338
<i>The other is as though
everything is a miracle.</i>

01:19.922 --> 01:23.508
<i>I choose to believe the latter,
and for good reason.</i>

01:29.681 --> 01:31.016
<i>My mother is always reminding me,</i>

01:31.141 --> 01:34.019
<i>there is often more to things
than meets the eye.</i>

01:35.896 --> 01:37.522
<i>That if we can zoom out a little,</i>

01:37.648 --> 01:42.027
<i>we'll realize that life
is happening for us, not to us.</i>

02:16.061 --> 02:17.563
<i>And if we just allow it to,</i>

02:17.688 --> 02:21.024
<i>the ride can be beautiful,
awesome and fantastic.</i>

02:31.201 --> 02:33.537
<i>She never said that it would be easy.</i>

02:39.835 --> 02:44.298
<i>Look, I get it, it doesn't always seem
like rainbows and butterflies.</i>

02:47.718 --> 02:48.719
Chris.

02:51.388 --> 02:53.599
<i>It's hard to zoom out
in a moment like this.</i>

03:03.901 --> 03:06.695
<i>It's hard to believe that this
was life happening for me.</i>

03:06.820 --> 03:07.988
Chris?

03:09.740 --> 03:11.074
Chris, please wake up.

03:11.199 --> 03:12.659
<i>Or for any of us.</i>

03:24.838 --> 03:26.924
<i>It certainly didn't feel like
there could be anything good</i>

03:27.049 --> 03:28.216
<i>about this situation.</i>

03:30.719 --> 03:33.555
<i>But hang on,
I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

03:39.269 --> 03:42.064
<i>This story really starts
years before I was even born...</i>

03:57.537 --> 03:58.789
Pressure!

03:58.914 --> 03:59.915
Here we go.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.043
<i>...with another kid
from another part of the world.</i>

04:04.086 --> 04:05.671
Safe!

04:05.796 --> 04:06.922
Back off!

04:07.047 --> 04:08.257
Come on!

04:11.009 --> 04:12.135
What about Jorge?

04:13.679 --> 04:16.264
- Does he have the wind?
- Three minutes left.

04:19.935 --> 04:20.936
Bolivar!

04:21.061 --> 04:22.521
Bolivar! Come on.

04:24.106 --> 04:27.276
You're in. I need you in midfield.
You need to put pressure on.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.778
We need a goal, OK? We need the win.
Make it happen.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.405
- OK.
- Make it happen.

04:31.530 --> 04:33.407
Let's go, boys!

04:45.586 --> 04:47.963
Yes! Push it up!

04:50.257 --> 04:51.758
Get to the middle!

05:03.979 --> 05:06.815
<i>Jorge Bolivar and I
could not have been further apart.</i>

05:06.940 --> 05:09.318
<i>I was from
a middle-class American family.</i>

05:09.443 --> 05:11.862
<i>Jorge was practically Cuban royalty.</i>

05:21.204 --> 05:23.332
<i>Who would have believed
that our lives and our families</i>

05:23.457 --> 05:26.001
<i>would come together in a way
none of us could have imagined?</i>

05:43.977 --> 05:46.063
The surgery looks to be a success.

05:46.188 --> 05:48.065
He's on his way to the ICU right now.

05:48.190 --> 05:49.191
Oh, thank God.

05:49.316 --> 05:52.819
We did have to remove
the lower lobe of his left lung.

05:52.945 --> 05:55.572
He'll still be able to breathe,
but I need to warn you,

05:55.697 --> 05:57.324
the disease is progressive.

05:57.449 --> 05:59.826
You need to prepare yourself
for the fact

05:59.952 --> 06:02.329
that your son most likely
won't make it to 20.

06:02.454 --> 06:05.207
We were told he wouldn't make it to 12.

06:05.332 --> 06:08.335
My advice is to not let him
exert himself too much.

06:08.460 --> 06:10.837
He just doesn't have the lung capacity.

06:19.012 --> 06:19.972
Papa?

06:22.432 --> 06:23.517
We're here, son.

06:23.642 --> 06:25.269
You're going to be all right.

06:26.770 --> 06:28.480
You're a fighter.

06:29.648 --> 06:31.316
I'm a fighter.

06:31.441 --> 06:32.776
You're a fighter.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.407
<i>And he</i> was a fighter.

06:38.532 --> 06:39.950
<i>He took every day as it came</i>

06:41.076 --> 06:42.411
<i>as borrowed time.</i>

06:43.287 --> 06:45.664
Hey, the phone's been ringing for you
all afternoon, George.

06:47.583 --> 06:48.792
It's from Cuba.

06:49.084 --> 06:50.002
All right.

07:06.518 --> 07:07.477
Hello?

07:07.603 --> 07:09.479
Jorge, I've been trying to reach you.

07:09.605 --> 07:11.440
<i>Papa? Is that you?</i>

07:11.565 --> 07:12.816
- Yes, Jorge.
- <i>What's going on?</i>

07:12.941 --> 07:13.817
Is everything OK?

07:13.942 --> 07:16.987
I need you to go to Miami,
to help set things up for us.

07:17.112 --> 07:18.947
- <i>When?</i>
- As soon as possible.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.616
<i>Castro is becoming...</i>

07:20.741 --> 07:21.909
unpredictable.

07:22.034 --> 07:25.495
- <i>Castro is just...</i>
- We don't know what he'll do next.

07:25.621 --> 07:28.790
Get to Miami. We'll catch up
with you as soon as we can.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.710
- OK. OK.
- <i>Revolutionary...</i>

07:31.835 --> 07:34.254
<i>This was one of those
zoom-out moments.</i>

07:34.379 --> 07:36.256
<i>Life was happening</i> for <i>Jorge.</i>

07:41.678 --> 07:44.514
Yo!

07:44.640 --> 07:45.766
What are you...

07:45.891 --> 07:49.269
No. No, no, no.
You're not playing video games.

07:49.394 --> 07:51.063
Have you seen it?
It's beautiful outside.

07:51.188 --> 07:52.314
Come on, man. Let's go.

07:52.439 --> 07:55.317
Yo, come on. We gotta get moving.
We gotta get Brian, Matt, the Douvilles.

07:55.442 --> 07:58.445
We gotta pick them up on the way.
So let's go.

07:58.570 --> 08:01.240
- And who's driving?
- Um, you are.

08:01.573 --> 08:03.575
Man, when are you gonna get
your license?

08:03.700 --> 08:06.203
Why would I do that
when I got you? Hmm?

08:08.622 --> 08:09.665
There it is!

08:10.582 --> 08:11.625
Ooh!

08:14.878 --> 08:16.004
Whoo!

08:18.799 --> 08:19.883
Yo!

08:20.008 --> 08:22.135
Yo, I got you, I got you, I got you.

08:23.262 --> 08:24.763
- You know, you know.
- Go, go, go!

08:28.559 --> 08:29.476
Whoo!

08:29.601 --> 08:31.728
Of course you'd make that shot.

08:33.146 --> 08:36.190
Yo, Chris. Chris, this isn't funny.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.569
Chris! Stop fucking around.

08:40.362 --> 08:41.572
Was that a swish?

08:41.697 --> 08:44.116
Because I think I distinctly
heard a swish right there.

08:44.241 --> 08:45.492
Ho!

08:45.617 --> 08:46.702
Whoo!

08:46.827 --> 08:48.662
- Hey!
- Huh?

08:48.787 --> 08:50.289
Mom and Dad want you home.

08:50.706 --> 08:54.793
Johnny Boy, I'm gonna enjoy this for
a minute then I'll get you in the car.

08:54.918 --> 08:56.837
Now, hot shot.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.798
Jeez, man.

09:04.261 --> 09:06.930
You should have come out
with us today, it was real fun.

09:09.725 --> 09:14.021
Or not. Everybody's entitled
to their own weekend, I suppose.

09:22.446 --> 09:23.864
You're not coming inside?

09:24.489 --> 09:25.866
I got a study session.

09:27.951 --> 09:32.331
OK. All right. Cool, cool.
Uh, good chat.

09:39.171 --> 09:43.634
Hello, dearest parents.
Your favorite son has arrived.

09:43.759 --> 09:45.010
Damn it.

09:45.719 --> 09:48.513
OK. Maybe your second-favorite son.

09:48.639 --> 09:50.224
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honey.

09:50.933 --> 09:52.976
I made you some sandwiches.
They're on the table.

09:53.101 --> 09:56.104
Thanks. Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

10:05.572 --> 10:06.865
Did you open this?

10:06.990 --> 10:08.283
Yeah.

10:23.632 --> 10:25.092
I'm sorry.

10:25.842 --> 10:28.428
But you did get into Loyola.

10:28.554 --> 10:31.098
I know Colin will be really happy
to have you there.

10:32.474 --> 10:34.184
Yeah. Well, I...

10:34.309 --> 10:36.228
I guess I just had this idea

10:36.353 --> 10:38.480
that John and I would go
to the same college and...

10:38.605 --> 10:40.774
do the whole roommates thing, you know?

10:40.899 --> 10:42.150
Yeah, I know.

10:43.860 --> 10:48.323
You know what? I think I'm...
I'm just gonna go downstairs.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.742
Thanks for the, uh... the food.

10:53.078 --> 10:55.038
Maybe you should have
worked harder at it.

11:03.088 --> 11:04.214
Hey.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.216
Rough one.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.386
Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe he's right.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.892
Come here. Your mom needs some love.

11:15.851 --> 11:17.644
Your mom needs some love.

11:18.353 --> 11:19.855
Aw!

11:19.980 --> 11:21.648
You know I can see
what you're doing.

11:21.773 --> 11:24.109
This is kind of obvious.

11:26.445 --> 11:28.155
I just want you to remember

11:28.280 --> 11:32.117
that when things don't work out,
there's always a reason.

11:32.242 --> 11:34.995
We just might not see it
in the moment...

11:35.120 --> 11:36.288
What's the reason?

11:36.413 --> 11:39.708
John might actually crack a smile
for once if I went to school with him?

11:39.833 --> 11:41.084
Maybe.

11:41.209 --> 11:44.254
And maybe there's something
for you at Loyola.

11:44.379 --> 11:48.508
Ah, because life is happening
<i>for</i> me, not <i>to me, right?</i>

11:48.634 --> 11:51.762
Oh! Look at my smart son
listening to his mom.

11:51.887 --> 11:55.015
Yeah. You know, when you say words,
I actually hear them, it's weird.

11:55.140 --> 11:56.433
That's very good to know.

11:57.142 --> 12:00.354
Now, I want you to call your brother
Colin and tell him the good news.

12:03.523 --> 12:04.608
Yes, ma'am.

12:10.364 --> 12:11.823
Go on, go on.

12:13.367 --> 12:15.160
- I'm kidding.
- I'll just go listen over here.

12:15.285 --> 12:16.203
Yeah, OK.

12:17.412 --> 12:18.413
Hey, man. What's up?

12:20.290 --> 12:22.000
Yeah. No, no. I'm good.

12:22.125 --> 12:24.253
Uh, look, I was just calling
to let you know

12:24.378 --> 12:28.423
that your better-looking, more talented,
smarter little brother

12:28.548 --> 12:31.385
is coming to Loyola, so get ready.

12:31.510 --> 12:32.636
<i>My mom was right.</i>

12:32.761 --> 12:34.596
<i>I had to trust that
there was a bigger reason</i>

12:34.721 --> 12:36.557
<i>things were happening
the way they were.</i>

12:38.433 --> 12:39.851
<i>And same for Jorge.</i>

12:40.269 --> 12:43.772
<i>After all, he did make it past 20,
all the way to 30.</i>

12:44.773 --> 12:47.109
<i>And he was just about
to meet his bigger reason.</i>

13:04.376 --> 13:07.212
Lunch menus. Lunch menus.

13:07.337 --> 13:10.340
- Menu?
- Yes, please.

13:11.675 --> 13:14.011
- All right.
- Is this your first flight, sir?

13:14.136 --> 13:16.930
Oh, no. It's like this every time.

13:17.806 --> 13:20.809
- Deep breaths.
- Oh, I'm trying.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.352
Trust me.

13:25.397 --> 13:26.398
Sir.

13:30.611 --> 13:34.489
Listen, is there anything I can do to
make take-off a little easier for you?

13:35.949 --> 13:37.576
You could hold my hand.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.914
It would make it a lot easier
for me to breathe

13:42.039 --> 13:43.540
if you were holding my hand.

13:53.842 --> 13:59.097
I think this might actually help.
There you go.

14:00.682 --> 14:02.100
And how's that?

14:02.226 --> 14:04.519
One small step in the right direction.

14:05.896 --> 14:08.482
- Peanuts?
- Getting warmer.

14:08.607 --> 14:11.526
Just... please.
Just... Just for take-off.

14:18.367 --> 14:22.287
So, do you have a name, in case I need
to summon a medic or something?

14:22.412 --> 14:23.830
Jorge.

14:23.956 --> 14:25.666
- Jorge.
- Yeah.

14:25.791 --> 14:28.001
Are you in Puerto Rico
for business or pleasure, Jorge?

14:28.126 --> 14:29.211
- It's business.
- Business.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.588
But it's quickly shifting to pleasure.

14:33.131 --> 14:34.841
- What kind of business?
- Rum.

14:34.967 --> 14:36.885
- Rum?
- Hm-hmm.

14:37.010 --> 14:40.097
My father wanted to make sure
that we could handle our liquor

14:40.222 --> 14:42.015
- before we went to college.
- OK.

14:42.140 --> 14:45.394
Turns out that
rum is actually my favorite.

14:45.519 --> 14:46.728
Do you have a favorite brand?

14:46.853 --> 14:49.565
Well... Bolivar, of course.

14:49.690 --> 14:52.442
OK. Well, this is...

14:52.568 --> 14:54.444
This is more than a coincidence.

14:57.072 --> 15:00.867
Oh! You work for Bolivar.

15:00.993 --> 15:03.161
Bolivar. OK.

15:05.330 --> 15:07.291
Well, you don't waste time, do you?

15:07.416 --> 15:09.084
I don't have time to waste.

15:25.017 --> 15:26.226
So you made it.

15:26.351 --> 15:27.853
I did.

15:27.978 --> 15:30.814
- I really enjoyed talking to you.
- Me too.

15:31.523 --> 15:34.401
I think I've finally got
the circulation back in my fingers.

15:34.526 --> 15:36.987
I'm so sorry about that.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.573
In Miami for long?

15:39.698 --> 15:43.827
- Uh, just tonight.
- Oh. And how can I see you again?

15:45.203 --> 15:47.414
You just like that Bolivar
is my favorite drink.

15:47.539 --> 15:50.167
Of course I do,
but how can I see you again?

15:50.292 --> 15:53.670
All right, Mr. Bolivar.

15:55.380 --> 15:57.716
Let's see if that's
just the rum talking.

16:16.902 --> 16:20.280
The most important thing
is that we do not skip a beat.

16:20.906 --> 16:21.949
What's her name?

16:25.494 --> 16:28.455
- It's the future Mrs. Jorge Bolivar.
- What?

16:29.414 --> 16:30.707
Boys!

16:31.750 --> 16:32.834
Focus!

16:34.503 --> 16:36.046
Let's get to work.

16:36.964 --> 16:40.217
As always, readings for next week
are listed in the syllabus,

16:40.342 --> 16:44.846
and a reminder that pop quizzes
make up 30 percent of your grade.

16:44.972 --> 16:46.098
Hint, hint.

16:46.223 --> 16:49.142
- Thirty percent.
- See you next week.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.151
Aw, excuse me. My bad.

16:58.277 --> 16:59.820
Thank you.

17:00.529 --> 17:02.197
Oh! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.949
That's my fault. I, um...

17:04.073 --> 17:07.369
I, I didn't, um...
That's... it's my fault. Um...

17:08.161 --> 17:09.663
Excuse me.

17:09.788 --> 17:11.331
Excuse me.

17:13.667 --> 17:15.293
All right. Let's get settled.

17:15.836 --> 17:17.044
Hey.

17:18.504 --> 17:20.715
Are you in this class also?

17:20.840 --> 17:22.592
Hm-hmm. Yeah.

17:23.385 --> 17:24.595
Yeah. This...

17:25.177 --> 17:26.178
Nope.

17:26.305 --> 17:28.974
No, uh... I was.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.275
I'm... I'm gonna go now.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.568
Sorry for the...

17:41.987 --> 17:43.280
Excuse me.

17:48.327 --> 17:50.621
I don't know. The dude just smells.

17:50.746 --> 17:52.164
That's roommates, man.

17:52.289 --> 17:54.082
Wait. Have you asked him about it?

17:54.207 --> 17:56.460
I'm worried he's one of those...
one of those hoarders

17:56.585 --> 17:59.087
who leaves half-eaten
chicken carcasses under his bed.

17:59.212 --> 18:02.758
- Gross. Have you checked?
- I'm scared to.

18:02.883 --> 18:05.302
The smell's so bad, though,
I'm gonna have to.

18:05.427 --> 18:06.929
Yeah. Anyway, pray for me.

18:07.054 --> 18:08.555
- Yeah. Good luck, man.
- See ya.

18:09.556 --> 18:10.599
What is he talking about?

18:10.724 --> 18:14.144
Hey, bro, you seem a little dazed.
First month of college getting to you?

18:15.854 --> 18:17.898
- I had a vision.
- Huh?

18:18.023 --> 18:21.026
- A vision.
- What's a vision, Chris?

18:23.904 --> 18:26.490
It was the most beautiful girl
that I've ever seen.

18:26.615 --> 18:28.742
Seriously, in my entire life.

18:28.867 --> 18:30.744
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:30.869 --> 18:33.205
You are not usually one
to get flustered about a girl.

18:33.330 --> 18:35.499
I know. But she's, like, angelic, man.

18:35.624 --> 18:38.669
It was this vision, like,
right in front of me.

18:39.670 --> 18:42.422
I gotta see her again.
I can't go to class. I gotta see her.

18:42.547 --> 18:45.133
- Hey, hey! Slow your roll, dude.
- I have to see her.

18:45.259 --> 18:48.178
- I'm serious.
- There will be plenty of girls, Chris.

18:49.346 --> 18:51.974
Not like this one, man.
Not like this one.

18:53.684 --> 18:54.768
<i>My brother was right.</i>

18:54.893 --> 18:58.146
<i>I was only a freshman,
and there would be plenty of girls.</i>

18:58.272 --> 19:01.733
<i>But she was right in front of me.</i>

19:01.858 --> 19:03.193
- Ooh!
- I'm sorry.

19:03.318 --> 19:05.237
I'm so sorry, I was lost.

19:07.322 --> 19:08.657
- You.
- You.

19:11.952 --> 19:17.249
- Safety patrol.
- Yeah. What do you think? Lame?

19:17.374 --> 19:19.918
No, not... not exactly lame.

19:20.043 --> 19:22.462
But there's no... ring to it.

19:22.588 --> 19:24.381
Well, it depends
what you're trying to say.

19:24.506 --> 19:26.758
Are you trying to say,

19:27.718 --> 19:30.429
"We, the Safety Patrol,
are here to patrol you"?

19:30.554 --> 19:33.682
Or are you trying to say, like,
"Yo! What's up, guys?

19:33.807 --> 19:35.142
We're trying to have a good time.

19:35.267 --> 19:37.144
Safety Buddy's here
to get you home safely"?

19:37.269 --> 19:40.230
All right. OK, I see your point.
It's a little too scary.

19:40.355 --> 19:41.523
Just a tad.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.483
But I need people
to know how serious this.

19:43.609 --> 19:46.612
No, absolutely, and I agree with you.
That's why I think maybe if you...

19:47.779 --> 19:49.990
change it a little bit,
people might actually...

19:50.115 --> 19:53.076
- OK.
- ...wanna join or use the service.

19:53.201 --> 19:55.579
OK. Fair point. Thank you.

19:55.704 --> 19:56.997
- These are yours.
- Yep.

19:57.122 --> 19:59.833
And I'm... I'm Chris Gregory.

19:59.958 --> 20:01.418
Hi, Chris Gregory.

20:01.543 --> 20:04.087
- Hi.
- And thank you for your input.

20:05.213 --> 20:07.257
Yeah. See, aren't you glad
you bumped into me?

20:07.382 --> 20:08.717
- Twice.
- Twice.

20:08.842 --> 20:11.887
- Hm-hmm.
- Yes. Yeah. Twice.

20:12.012 --> 20:14.890
- Samantha.
- Sam. Just Sam.

20:15.015 --> 20:16.308
Sam. Just Sam. OK.

20:16.433 --> 20:18.268
Cool. Well, Just Sam,
today's your lucky day.

20:18.393 --> 20:20.270
- You just got your first Safety Buddy.
- Really?

20:20.395 --> 20:21.438
- Yeah.
- You want to join?

20:21.563 --> 20:23.357
Definitely. I can tell
you care about it.

20:23.482 --> 20:25.067
- I do. Great.
- That's me, this guy.

20:25.192 --> 20:27.110
Then you are my first safety driver.

20:28.654 --> 20:30.155
- Ahh!
- What?

20:30.280 --> 20:31.615
See, I can't drive.

20:31.740 --> 20:34.034
- You can't drive?
- Don't have my license.

20:34.159 --> 20:35.410
- Oh.
- But I'm getting it.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.287
- Oh?
- Yes, and you're gonna help me.

20:37.412 --> 20:39.915
- I'm gonna help you?
- Until then, I'll be your ride-along.

20:40.040 --> 20:42.459
- My what?
- Yeah. Like your buddy in the side.

20:45.504 --> 20:47.798
Why do I have this feeling
like I'm getting conned into something?

20:47.923 --> 20:51.051
Because you are. But it's gonna
work out for you in the end.

20:51.176 --> 20:53.971
- Is it?
- Yes. And, um...

20:55.347 --> 20:56.932
Hmm...

20:57.057 --> 21:00.018
It's not really safe for
the Safety Buddy to be so pretty, right?

21:02.688 --> 21:03.897
Well, OK, then.

21:04.022 --> 21:05.148
OK, yeah.

21:05.274 --> 21:09.111
Oh, what's that? You need me in class?
Oh! What are you gonna do?

21:09.236 --> 21:11.405
I gotta go. Yeah.

21:11.530 --> 21:13.407
Maybe, uh, change it. Yeah.

21:19.788 --> 21:21.331
Oh, my goodness.

21:21.456 --> 21:23.667
- You're here!
- I am. Yes.

21:23.792 --> 21:25.794
- On your way to...
- Seattle.

21:25.919 --> 21:29.214
Yeah. I was just hoping
we could get more time to talk.

21:29.339 --> 21:31.758
Well, that would be nice.

21:32.217 --> 21:34.469
I mean, I love my family,

21:34.595 --> 21:38.974
but it's just they're perfectly content
to stay in the same small town,

21:39.099 --> 21:41.602
and I felt like I needed to get out
and see the world a bit

21:41.727 --> 21:44.062
before, you know, I settled down.

21:44.187 --> 21:46.273
It makes perfect sense to me.

21:47.733 --> 21:49.234
I can't believe you're here.

21:49.359 --> 21:52.487
- You just showed up.
- I did. I just showed up.

21:52.613 --> 21:54.448
I thought you would call or something.

21:54.573 --> 21:57.034
W-Would you rather I called instead?

21:57.159 --> 21:58.619
- No.
- No?

21:58.744 --> 22:02.581
No. I love that you...

22:03.874 --> 22:05.876
I mean, you caught me by surprise.

22:07.127 --> 22:09.087
Can you ask me
another question or something

22:09.212 --> 22:11.924
so I can stop blushing like this?

22:12.049 --> 22:14.593
Um...

22:14.718 --> 22:16.553
Do you enjoy being a stewardess?

22:16.678 --> 22:18.680
Uh, yes, I do.

22:18.805 --> 22:21.975
It's given me a much-needed
sense of independence.

22:22.100 --> 22:24.811
Hmm. You feel free. I love that.

22:24.937 --> 22:28.023
- Yeah. For the most part.
- For the most part?

22:28.148 --> 22:30.484
I mean, I wouldn't have been able
to see any of this

22:30.609 --> 22:31.860
if it wasn't for my job.

22:31.985 --> 22:33.153
You mean, like, Seattle?

22:33.278 --> 22:36.949
Yeah. I wouldn't
have been able to see... Seattle.

22:38.450 --> 22:41.328
I don't know about you,
but I prefer a little bit more sunshine.

22:42.162 --> 22:43.372
Me too.

22:43.497 --> 22:45.165
Well, that's good to know.

22:45.791 --> 22:47.376
What time is it?

22:47.501 --> 22:51.004
Oh, my Lord. I have to go.

22:54.091 --> 22:55.217
Are you all right?

22:57.010 --> 22:59.721
It's just... Yeah.

23:00.180 --> 23:01.223
Are you sure?

23:02.182 --> 23:04.142
It's dust is all. It's over. I'm OK.

23:04.268 --> 23:08.855
All right. Well, thank you for...

23:10.399 --> 23:11.775
dropping by.

23:12.109 --> 23:13.402
It's a pleasure.

23:13.527 --> 23:15.612
Yeah. I gotta fly.

23:15.737 --> 23:20.784
- OK.
- Literally. All right. Bye!

23:39.803 --> 23:41.430
Oh! Wow.

23:41.555 --> 23:43.557
How long were you standing there?

23:43.682 --> 23:45.726
I saw, like, the whole entire dance.

23:45.851 --> 23:47.311
All of it, the...

23:47.436 --> 23:50.981
Yeah, well, I do this thing,
this procrastination thing,

23:51.106 --> 23:54.359
where I have to clean everything before
I can actually sit down and study.

23:54.484 --> 23:55.611
Sounds like a cool thing.

23:55.736 --> 23:58.030
Listen, if you want to stop by my place
when you're done here,

23:58.155 --> 24:00.741
that'd be great because
I could really use your service.

24:00.866 --> 24:04.578
- Hmm, let me think about it. No.
- No? OK, then...

24:04.703 --> 24:06.914
- Hi.
- Wow.

24:07.039 --> 24:09.458
That is quite the outfit you got on.

24:09.583 --> 24:12.544
Thanks. Thank you.
I got this for you.

24:12.669 --> 24:14.588
- What?
- It's your Safety Buddy shirt.

24:14.713 --> 24:17.090
- We're gonna wear them, like twins.
- My Safety Buddy shirt?

24:17.215 --> 24:18.342
Pretty safe, huh?

24:19.259 --> 24:20.552
Wow. You are such a nerd.

24:20.677 --> 24:22.638
Yes, yes, I'm a massive nerd.

24:22.763 --> 24:24.681
Oh.

24:26.141 --> 24:27.893
- Ooh, I gotta get this.
- You get that.

24:28.018 --> 24:29.394
- But call me on Saturday.
- Yes.

24:29.519 --> 24:30.854
You got it, OK. Bring that.

24:30.979 --> 24:33.440
- I'll bring it.
- OK, all right. Enjoy.

24:33.565 --> 24:35.442
Hey, Brad. Hey, yeah.

24:35.567 --> 24:39.154
I was just talking to this freshman
who's gonna help me with Safety Buddies.

24:50.457 --> 24:51.959
Thank you.

25:00.259 --> 25:01.843
Thought you said you liked the sunshine.

25:01.969 --> 25:03.971
- I did. I do.
- Yeah?

25:04.930 --> 25:06.807
- Wow.
- Are you happy?

25:07.766 --> 25:09.351
Happy, yes.

25:11.603 --> 25:12.729
Oh, Jorge.

25:12.854 --> 25:15.524
- I've only got a ten-hour layover.
- We better get going then.

25:16.441 --> 25:17.943
I give you Hawaii.

25:27.703 --> 25:29.371
What do you think? Should we go in?

25:30.080 --> 25:31.456
- Huh?
- All right.

25:37.212 --> 25:38.964
- Come on.
- Is it cold?

25:39.089 --> 25:40.424
I'm just a little sensitive.

25:40.549 --> 25:41.925
- Oh, it's fine.
- Are you sure?

25:42.050 --> 25:43.760
- Seriously.
- I'm a little bit sensitive.

25:47.264 --> 25:48.640
That's not nice.

25:50.642 --> 25:52.060
That's very not nice.

25:53.186 --> 25:54.187
Whoo!

25:54.313 --> 25:56.815
Now I'm gonna get you!
I'm gonna get you!

25:57.608 --> 25:59.276
- You win. You win.
- OK.

25:59.401 --> 26:01.278
You totally win.

26:03.030 --> 26:04.364
Am I in paradise?

26:05.032 --> 26:08.118
- No, it's real.
- This doesn't feel real.

26:10.370 --> 26:12.039
No!

26:26.345 --> 26:28.847
- You're a fish.
- Yeah. I love the ocean.

26:28.972 --> 26:31.058
Yeah. I can tell.

26:32.684 --> 26:34.394
You know a lot about me now.

26:34.519 --> 26:36.021
Tell me some more about you.

26:36.146 --> 26:39.566
More than that I love the ocean
and I find you incredibly beautiful?

26:39.691 --> 26:41.652
Yes. More.

26:42.194 --> 26:45.364
So I work with my family
in the rum business, as you know.

26:45.489 --> 26:49.868
We were forced to leave our headquarters
in Cuba when I was in college,

26:49.993 --> 26:52.537
and ever since then, I've been
heading the Puerto Rican operation.

26:52.663 --> 26:53.664
Do you like it?

26:53.789 --> 26:57.000
Heading the Puerto Rican operation
or working with my family?

26:57.125 --> 26:58.377
Both.

26:58.502 --> 27:01.004
Well, I like that I get to travel
to Puerto Rico.

27:01.129 --> 27:03.173
In regards to working
with my family, I...

27:03.298 --> 27:05.759
I haven't known anything else.

27:05.884 --> 27:07.928
But I wouldn't change that.

27:08.053 --> 27:10.681
I love my family.
Family's everything to me.

27:10.806 --> 27:14.017
And I'm very proud of the Bolivar legacy
that I'm a part of.

27:14.142 --> 27:16.645
Family is very important to me, too.

27:17.354 --> 27:21.358
- Is it?
- I want to have a huge family.

27:21.483 --> 27:25.195
I want to have dozens
and dozens of babies.

27:25.320 --> 27:26.613
Leslie, we just met.

27:26.738 --> 27:28.615
You're talking about our babies already.

27:34.454 --> 27:36.623
I've noticed that you cough a lot.

27:37.124 --> 27:38.125
You did?

27:38.250 --> 27:41.628
Yeah. Well, I noticed it a few times.

27:41.753 --> 27:45.215
I was hoping you wouldn't.
It's nothing, really.

27:45.340 --> 27:47.259
I was just wondering
if it had anything to do

27:47.384 --> 27:48.677
with the scar on your back.

27:50.637 --> 27:53.098
I'm sorry. Was that too personal?

27:53.223 --> 27:54.474
No. No. It's...

27:54.933 --> 27:57.144
You know, maybe it's just
one of those things I...

27:57.728 --> 27:59.563
you know,
I haven't known any other way.

27:59.688 --> 28:01.315
I don't talk about it much.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.066
At all, really.

28:04.151 --> 28:05.235
Why not?

28:05.360 --> 28:07.112
Maybe it's machismo, I guess.

28:07.237 --> 28:10.657
I don't want to show my weakness.
Especially with you.

28:11.491 --> 28:13.118
Well, you don't have
to worry about that.

28:13.243 --> 28:15.871
I know that. I know.

28:18.457 --> 28:20.667
Somehow you make me feel
very much at ease.

28:20.792 --> 28:22.669
I hope I do.

28:25.797 --> 28:29.092
I can't believe this day's already over.

28:30.260 --> 28:33.222
- So it was a good surprise.
- I don't want it to end.

28:33.347 --> 28:36.016
Neither do I.

28:37.184 --> 28:42.356
Listen, I don't know what's going on,
but I just feel so close to you already,

28:42.481 --> 28:45.275
and after hearing everything
that happened to you as a child,

28:45.400 --> 28:47.110
and everything
that you've been through,

28:47.236 --> 28:49.363
I don't want us to be apart.

28:49.488 --> 28:51.782
What if something happens to you?

28:51.907 --> 28:54.451
- You know what you are?
- What?

28:55.035 --> 28:56.828
- A peanut.
- What?

28:56.954 --> 28:59.373
The sweetest peanut
I've ever laid my eyes on.

28:59.498 --> 29:01.750
- A peanut?
- Yeah, <i>my</i> peanut.

29:01.875 --> 29:04.878
And you don't have to worry about me.

29:05.003 --> 29:07.631
- We have plenty of time together.
- Do you promise?

29:08.715 --> 29:10.133
I promise.

29:20.978 --> 29:22.354
Hold on.

29:22.479 --> 29:25.107
Before you leave, just one thing.

29:27.150 --> 29:28.151
Guys.

29:34.533 --> 29:38.036
<i>♪ Today I may not have</i>

29:38.161 --> 29:40.163
<i>♪ A thing at all</i>

29:42.291 --> 29:45.794

29:45.919 --> 29:48.130
<i>Yeah, well, you gotta admit...</i>

29:48.255 --> 29:50.257
<i>♪ But I've got lots of plans...</i>

29:50.382 --> 29:52.342

<i>♪ And all my tomorrows...</i>

29:56.054 --> 29:57.139
<i>I mean, so did I.</i>

29:57.264 --> 30:01.768
<i>I just... I just wish mine
was as classy and smooth.</i>

30:01.894 --> 30:04.354
Sorry, man. I'm not gonna
make it to this one tonight.

30:04.479 --> 30:06.690
What do you mean?
What are you doing instead?

30:06.815 --> 30:10.485
I got this, um, Safety Buddies thing.
It's like a...

30:10.611 --> 30:11.737
A what thing?

30:11.862 --> 30:13.071
Safety Buddies.

30:13.196 --> 30:15.574
I've gotta drive people that,
like, they call us,

30:15.699 --> 30:17.743
and we drive them back home
from wherever they are.

30:17.868 --> 30:18.952
<i>Um, Chris?</i>

30:19.077 --> 30:20.537
You don't drive.

30:20.662 --> 30:22.497
I don't. Thank you for telling me.

30:22.623 --> 30:24.166
It's about that girl, isn't it?

30:24.291 --> 30:25.751
It's <i>the</i> girl, man.

30:25.876 --> 30:27.794
Seriously,
I've never seen you like this.

30:27.920 --> 30:31.131
She's special, man. I can't...
can't explain it.

30:31.256 --> 30:33.008
All right.

30:33.133 --> 30:35.052
- <i>Good luck.</i>
- Thank you.

30:35.177 --> 30:38.138
All right, man. Cool. Well, have fun.
I love you lots, OK?

30:38.263 --> 30:39.681
Bye.

30:39.806 --> 30:42.309
- Hi.
- Hey... hi.

30:42.976 --> 30:47.314
- How long have you been in the door?
- "Love you, man. Have fun. Bye."

30:47.439 --> 30:48.982
- That's it?
- Hm-hmm.

30:49.107 --> 30:50.108
- Cool.
- Great.

30:50.234 --> 30:53.278
Great. Great, um...
I'm gonna let you know right now

30:53.403 --> 30:56.240
that it's totally cool
to love your brother, so...

30:56.365 --> 30:59.660
I know. It's OK. Don't worry.
I tell my brother I love him every day.

30:59.785 --> 31:01.328
Well, that's good that you do that.
Good.

31:01.453 --> 31:02.788
- Yeah.
- Good for you.

31:02.913 --> 31:04.665
Uh... You're wearing the shirt.

31:04.790 --> 31:06.458
- Looks great. Looks fine.
- Safety Buddies.

31:06.583 --> 31:09.044
I feel naked right now, so I'm...

31:09.169 --> 31:10.837
- I'm gonna get changed because...
- OK.

31:10.963 --> 31:12.589
- I'll go.
- I'll put mine on now.

31:12.714 --> 31:13.882
- OK.
- Cos I don't...

31:14.007 --> 31:15.717
- Hurry up.
- This is not... Great. Bye.

31:15.842 --> 31:18.262
- OK.
- Bye. Bye.

31:24.434 --> 31:26.520
Why are you an idiot?

31:27.896 --> 31:29.356
- For you.
- Yup.

31:29.481 --> 31:32.150
Ooh, I'm scared.

31:32.276 --> 31:35.612
Why? Because your iPod's, like,
the window to your soul?

31:35.737 --> 31:38.407
- Something like that.
- Something like that.

31:38.532 --> 31:40.909
OK. Let's see what we got here.

31:41.034 --> 31:42.661
Oh, no. Where are you going?

31:43.245 --> 31:44.830
Celine, "My Heart Will Go On."

31:44.955 --> 31:46.164
- Yeah.
- Absolute classic.

31:46.290 --> 31:48.375
- Kelly Clarkson, "Because of You."
- Hm-hmm.

31:48.500 --> 31:49.668
That's a sad one.

31:49.793 --> 31:51.920
- Yeah.
- John Mayer. Real dreamy.

31:52.045 --> 31:54.423
- He's handsome. I get it.
- He really is.

31:54.548 --> 31:57.217
He's a handsome fella. Oh, Queen B.

31:58.927 --> 32:00.846
Wow. Look at those moves.

32:00.971 --> 32:02.931
Strong, independent woman... Love it.

32:03.932 --> 32:06.560
- This is a good playlist. I like it.
- Oh, why, thank you.

32:06.685 --> 32:08.061
Oh-ho.

32:08.186 --> 32:09.980
What did you find?

32:11.023 --> 32:12.274
- <i>♪ You...</i>
- Oh.

32:13.275 --> 32:15.444
- Soulja Boy, "Crank That."
- Well, of course.

32:15.569 --> 32:17.654
Ten bucks says that you
have danced to this song

32:17.779 --> 32:19.197
in your room when nobody's looking.

32:19.323 --> 32:21.825
- Oh, and tell me you haven't.
- I absolutely have.

32:21.950 --> 32:22.951
I got a lot of layers.

32:23.076 --> 32:24.620
- You gotta peel them back.
- Oh, yeah?

32:24.745 --> 32:26.580
A bit of this, a bit of that.

32:26.705 --> 32:29.416
- What is that?
- I have no idea at all.

32:30.542 --> 32:33.003
OK, OK...

32:33.128 --> 32:34.338
"Fairy-tale Wedding."

32:34.463 --> 32:37.424
Oh! I forgot that was on there.
I'm gonna take that back. Yep.

32:37.549 --> 32:41.261
OK, I've obviously trespassed
onto some childhood dreams?

32:41.386 --> 32:44.514
What? You're telling me that
you've never had childhood dreams?

32:44.640 --> 32:48.268
Oh... So, what, does your boyfriend
know about it?

32:48.936 --> 32:50.354
My who?

32:50.479 --> 32:53.398
That guy you were on the phone to
before, what was his name?

32:53.523 --> 32:54.608
Billy or Boris?

32:54.733 --> 32:56.735
- Brad, Brad, Bradley.
- Brad.

32:56.860 --> 32:59.947
- Bradley.
- Brad. He is not my boyfriend.

33:00.072 --> 33:01.031
OK.

33:01.156 --> 33:05.077
I mean, I don't know,
I think that we're dating.

33:05.202 --> 33:06.119
You think?

33:06.245 --> 33:09.248
He's got a lot going on right now
and I'm finishing my senior year,

33:09.373 --> 33:11.792
so we're just keeping things... casual.

33:11.917 --> 33:13.043
- Casual?
- Hm-hmm.

33:13.168 --> 33:14.920
OK. Are they your words or his words?

33:15.045 --> 33:16.922
What do you mean?

33:17.047 --> 33:18.924
You have a fairy-tale wedding playlist.

33:19.049 --> 33:21.093
So? What, you don't have sisters?

33:22.052 --> 33:26.265
I don't know, maybe it's a girl thing
or a... me thing.

33:26.390 --> 33:28.183
I have a very healthy imagination, OK?

33:28.308 --> 33:30.852
Yeah, healthy imagination, sure,
but I'm just saying,

33:30.978 --> 33:32.688
fairy-tale wedding playlist,

33:32.813 --> 33:35.440
boring Brad, do they really...?

33:37.150 --> 33:38.443
Oh...

33:41.863 --> 33:43.615
I'm just looking out for you.

33:51.790 --> 33:53.959
Gimme the phone, gimme the phone,
gimme the phone.

33:55.377 --> 33:57.588
Hello. Safety Buddies.
How can we get you home safely?

33:57.713 --> 34:00.299
Uh-huh. Sure, absolutely.
We can be there. OK.

34:00.424 --> 34:02.092
OK, we'll see you there.

34:02.217 --> 34:03.135
Bye.

34:05.637 --> 34:06.805
Let's go!

34:09.057 --> 34:11.267
- Hold it in.
- Just one second. It's OK.

34:11.392 --> 34:13.812
- Pull over. OK. All right.
- OK.

34:13.937 --> 34:16.523
Oh, there you go, you're on all fours.

34:16.648 --> 34:18.316
- OK.
- Hold her hair. Grab her hair.

34:18.441 --> 34:19.860
- Grab her hair.
- Yeah.

34:19.985 --> 34:21.486
- OK. Look.
- You're good.

34:21.612 --> 34:24.197
We made it to the curb.
I'd say that's an accomplishment.

34:26.325 --> 34:28.075
OK!

34:28.619 --> 34:30.454
Yeah. OK.

34:30.579 --> 34:33.332
- Oh, you're so brave. Get it out.
- I'm so sorry.

34:33.457 --> 34:36.001
- No, no.
- No, you're so, so, so, so fine.

34:36.126 --> 34:37.753
It's good, just let it out.

34:37.878 --> 34:40.464
- Let it all out. There you go.
- Take your time.

34:42.381 --> 34:47.137
I assume this is not casual Brad's idea
of a great date night.

34:47.262 --> 34:48.805
Oh, no, OK.

34:51.642 --> 34:52.976
Get in the car.

34:53.101 --> 34:54.269
Let's get her some water.

34:56.979 --> 34:59.066
Oh!

34:59.191 --> 35:01.276
Safety Buddies.
How can we get you home safely?

35:02.402 --> 35:05.030
Uh, yeah. Yeah.
We're not too far from there.

35:05.155 --> 35:06.198
We'll see you in a second.

35:09.451 --> 35:12.037
This is totally legit of you guys
to be doing this.

35:12.162 --> 35:14.581
My friends, they totally bailed on me,

35:14.706 --> 35:17.334
and it would have been a major bummer
to crutch all the way home.

35:17.459 --> 35:19.586
Yeah, that would have sucked.
No problem.

35:22.923 --> 35:24.007
So, uh...

35:25.217 --> 35:27.135
big night studying, huh?

35:28.595 --> 35:30.222
OK. All right.

35:30.347 --> 35:31.640
Nice.

35:31.765 --> 35:33.850
You know what? Let me take...

35:33.976 --> 35:36.812
No, please, please.
I got it. It's OK. It's fine.

35:36.937 --> 35:39.940
I got it, I got it. Trust me. OK?

35:41.525 --> 35:43.819
Wow! No, yeah, just this way.

35:48.740 --> 35:50.200
I'm starving.

35:50.951 --> 35:54.037
Ooh. I could totally demolish
some nuggets right now.

35:55.330 --> 35:57.666
OK. What do you say?

35:57.791 --> 35:59.793
- Sure.
- All right.

35:59.918 --> 36:01.295
- To the nugs!
- To the nugs.

36:01.420 --> 36:02.379
Let's go!

36:15.976 --> 36:17.144
You love this, don't you?

36:17.269 --> 36:19.187
What, watching people eat?

36:19.313 --> 36:21.148
No. Helping people.

36:22.024 --> 36:23.984
I mean, your whole face
lights up when you do it.

36:24.735 --> 36:27.154
- It does?
- Yeah, a hundred percent.

36:27.279 --> 36:28.989
Well, you seem to like it yourself.

36:29.114 --> 36:33.201
And you've actually been
a really big help.

36:33.327 --> 36:36.079
I don't know, I'm just happy
to be a part, honestly.

36:36.997 --> 36:40.334
So, what was, like,
the deciding factor for you?

36:40.459 --> 36:43.795
I mean, what made you know
that this was what you wanted to do?

36:44.671 --> 36:45.714
Uh...

36:46.423 --> 36:48.216
Well, um...

36:48.342 --> 36:51.470
there's actually a personal tie for me.

36:52.179 --> 36:54.181
I'll preface it with this.

36:54.306 --> 36:56.767
She's fine, thank God.

36:57.768 --> 36:58.727
But, um...

37:00.771 --> 37:03.857
Two years ago, my mom
was almost killed in a car accident.

37:03.982 --> 37:06.944
She was driving to pick me
and my brother up from the airport

37:07.069 --> 37:09.446
when some guy

37:09.571 --> 37:12.074
coming home from a late night
crossed over the center divider

37:12.199 --> 37:13.450
and hit her head on.

37:14.534 --> 37:19.706
And she went into a coma and...
we didn't know if she was gonna make it.

37:21.708 --> 37:24.920
We were sitting there waiting
and it just felt like forever.

37:25.045 --> 37:28.632
And while praying for her to wake up,
I made a deal with the big guy,

37:28.757 --> 37:30.551
that if she was OK,

37:32.010 --> 37:35.347
then I would do whatever I could
to make sure other people stayed safe.

37:35.847 --> 37:37.933
And so, here we are.

37:41.979 --> 37:43.146
Wow.

37:46.108 --> 37:47.317
That's a, uh...

37:48.151 --> 37:50.279
That's a pretty deep layer, Sam.

37:50.404 --> 37:51.613
Hmm.

37:52.364 --> 37:54.074
I think she's beautiful.

37:54.866 --> 37:56.159
You two are beautiful.

38:04.418 --> 38:05.711
<i>Surfer dude was right.</i>

38:06.795 --> 38:10.090
<i>It is beautiful when you find a cause
that you're passionate about.</i>

38:11.550 --> 38:13.802
- That's good.
- Not in front of your face.

38:13.927 --> 38:15.762
- Over there?
- I'm the safest-looking.

38:18.348 --> 38:20.851
<i>Or that person that you're really into.</i>

38:24.563 --> 38:25.939
What?

38:27.566 --> 38:29.359
I didn't know you were coming.

38:30.485 --> 38:31.653
How are you?

38:36.491 --> 38:39.286
- You're doing it.
- OK.

38:39.411 --> 38:41.413
OK, go go, go, go!

38:44.124 --> 38:45.334
- Guinea...
- Try this.

38:45.459 --> 38:46.376
Guinea pig?

38:48.086 --> 38:51.173
<i>The person that lights you up
and you would travel anywhere for.</i>

38:52.799 --> 38:54.343
You don't need to take it on and off.

38:54.468 --> 38:57.763
I'm trying! The car takes itself
where it wants to go, it's not me.

39:01.767 --> 39:05.229
<i>That person that helps make life
so much sweeter than it already is.</i>

39:06.230 --> 39:09.733
<i>The one that makes
the ordinary extraordinary.</i>

39:11.985 --> 39:14.446
<i>And makes you do things
you wouldn't normally do.</i>

39:14.571 --> 39:18.951
<i>And avoid some of the things
that you're supposed to do.</i>

39:24.164 --> 39:25.123
Dad.

39:27.251 --> 39:28.710
Three Cs and a D.

39:28.835 --> 39:31.838
You know, it's not actually
what it looks like, because, um...

39:31.964 --> 39:34.633
Do you realize you're on the verge
of flunking out of your first term?

39:34.758 --> 39:36.009
Flunking's a strong word.

39:36.134 --> 39:38.220
And don't even get me started
on your phone bill.

39:39.012 --> 39:42.391
You... You were young
and in love once, right, Dad?

39:42.516 --> 39:45.060
- Chris.
- I'm just having fun, Dad.

39:45.185 --> 39:48.564
- Hey, I am serious.
- So am I. It's responsible fun.

39:48.689 --> 39:52.025
Get your grades up,
or no more support from us.

39:54.069 --> 39:58.991
- You hear me?
- Yeah. Loud and clear. Got you.

40:03.954 --> 40:05.289
Papa.

40:05.414 --> 40:07.332
You wanted to see me?

40:07.457 --> 40:08.792
Sit.

40:13.171 --> 40:14.548
Jorge...

40:17.634 --> 40:19.177
What is going on with you?

40:21.138 --> 40:22.931
Flying all over the place.

40:24.349 --> 40:27.144
- Who is this American girl?
- You know her name.

40:28.645 --> 40:31.690
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- You don't think she's worthy?

40:31.815 --> 40:34.484
- Of course not.
- She's a <i>gringa,</i> is that it?

40:34.610 --> 40:35.986
I never said that.

40:36.111 --> 40:38.155
- You don't approve.
- Stop putting words in my mouth!

40:38.280 --> 40:40.449
So she's an American, so what?

40:40.574 --> 40:43.785
I went to Stanford.
We live in Miami, for heaven's sake.

40:57.758 --> 40:58.717
Your health.

41:00.969 --> 41:02.137
Does she know?

41:03.555 --> 41:04.556
She knows.

41:20.155 --> 41:22.783
- Hi.
- Morning.

41:23.450 --> 41:26.078
- Am I snoring?
- No.

41:26.203 --> 41:27.663
Am I?

41:31.333 --> 41:32.334
I love you.

41:33.252 --> 41:34.294
What?

41:35.128 --> 41:37.172
I love every ounce of you.

41:38.382 --> 41:39.549
Me too.

41:40.717 --> 41:42.719
You know, I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

41:44.888 --> 41:46.807
And I want to spend more time together.

41:49.851 --> 41:52.896
I just wish we lived in the same city.

41:53.021 --> 41:54.898
I mean a lot more time.

41:59.278 --> 42:00.696
- What is that?
- What?

42:02.114 --> 42:03.282
What is it?

42:10.789 --> 42:13.041
- Will you marry me?
- Oh, my goodness.

42:14.376 --> 42:15.877
Be my wife?

42:16.878 --> 42:21.675
- What about your father and your...
- No, this is about us. <i>I</i> love you.

42:21.800 --> 42:24.136
I don't see my life without you.

42:26.013 --> 42:28.473
So, please marry me.

42:29.433 --> 42:30.559
Oh, my goodness.

42:31.894 --> 42:33.395
I love you so much.

42:35.397 --> 42:36.440
Yes.

42:45.365 --> 42:46.909
What do you think of this?

42:48.452 --> 42:50.787
"Dear Dad,
I want to thank you and Mom

42:50.913 --> 42:53.874
for giving me the chance to come back
and give it another shot.

42:53.999 --> 42:57.252
I feel like I'm finally getting
this college thing right

42:57.377 --> 42:59.796
and I'm taking full advantage
of this opportunity."

43:00.339 --> 43:01.298
Miss. Miss, hi.

43:01.423 --> 43:04.635
<i>"I'm so thankful for how patient
you both have been over the years..."</i>

43:04.760 --> 43:06.637
"...and that I have parents
who believe in me

43:06.762 --> 43:08.639
even when I didn't believe in myself."

43:08.764 --> 43:09.765
Hmm.

43:09.890 --> 43:12.601
"Thank you so much for all of this."

43:12.726 --> 43:15.062
"I love you. Chris."

43:18.148 --> 43:20.442
This is code
for the new girlfriend, isn't it?

43:21.401 --> 43:23.904
- Probably.
- Yeah.

43:27.658 --> 43:28.700
You did good.

43:38.293 --> 43:40.712
OK, Just Sam,
it's the moment of truth.

43:40.837 --> 43:43.006
Yep. It's a big moment. You ready?

43:43.131 --> 43:44.841
Kind of nervous.

43:45.259 --> 43:46.260
Organ donor?

43:46.385 --> 43:48.929
Yeah. Why not? I'm not gonna
need it when I'm gone, right?

43:49.054 --> 43:50.639
Yeah, I guess not.

43:50.764 --> 43:52.140
Mr. Chris Gregory.

43:52.683 --> 43:55.352
- That's you.
- That's me. Yes. One second.

43:55.477 --> 43:57.938
- One second, I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

43:58.063 --> 44:00.566
If I pass, you have to go
on a date with me.

44:00.691 --> 44:04.444
- What?
- Just say yes. Please. Please.

44:07.072 --> 44:09.074
- Uh, yes.
- Yes, yes.

44:09.199 --> 44:10.534
- Yes, yes!
- Yes?

44:10.659 --> 44:11.743
- Yes!
- Lovely.

44:11.868 --> 44:12.869
Yes.

44:15.539 --> 44:19.918
- Wow. You really went all out, huh?
- Yeah.

44:20.043 --> 44:22.588
I don't know, I figure
we got a lot to celebrate.

44:22.713 --> 44:24.840
- My newfound freedom.
- Hm-hmm.

44:24.965 --> 44:28.302
- Your almost graduation.
- Yeah.

44:29.052 --> 44:31.597
The fact that this is
our first official date.

44:33.056 --> 44:34.349
Yeah, I guess you're right.

44:34.474 --> 44:36.810
The celebrations do warrant the effort.

44:36.935 --> 44:39.229
- Yeah. Of course they do.
- Hm-hmm.

44:40.022 --> 44:42.858
So, what are you going to do
with your newfound liberation?

44:42.983 --> 44:45.611
You know what? I think I'm...

44:47.362 --> 44:49.698
I'm going to enjoy this date with you.

44:51.867 --> 44:53.827
I mean, in life.

44:53.952 --> 44:55.412
Oh.

44:55.537 --> 44:57.748
Like, you know,
have you thought about it?

44:57.873 --> 44:59.875
- About what?
- Life.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.211
- Oh. Life.
- You know, like future life.

45:03.337 --> 45:05.297
Oh. No, absolutely not.

45:06.089 --> 45:08.008
- Chris, seriously.
- What?

45:08.133 --> 45:09.635
Seriously. Have you thought about it?

45:09.760 --> 45:11.386
I don't know, I just, um...

45:11.511 --> 45:14.223
I like living in this moment
here with you.

45:14.348 --> 45:17.100
I don't wanna think ahead
or behind, you know?

45:17.226 --> 45:20.020
Yeah, I guess.

45:21.855 --> 45:23.690
I do really like helping people.

45:23.815 --> 45:26.777
I like seeing people happy.
It makes me happy, so...

45:27.319 --> 45:29.279
maybe something
along the lines of that.

45:29.404 --> 45:30.322
- You know.
- Hm-hmm.

45:30.447 --> 45:33.283
Use these good looks and charm
to save the world.

45:34.618 --> 45:35.619
Wow.

45:36.078 --> 45:38.288
My mom's studying to be a nurse, but...

45:39.790 --> 45:44.127
She's like... a really special person.

45:44.253 --> 45:49.174
I don't really think that I've got what
it takes, you know, to help people.

45:49.299 --> 45:51.718
I mean, I definitely
can't save somebody's life.

45:51.843 --> 45:53.053
I don't know.

45:54.096 --> 45:56.014
You've been a pretty amazing
Safety Buddy.

45:56.139 --> 45:57.516
- Oh.
- Hm-hmm.

45:57.641 --> 45:58.934
Is that so? Amazing?

45:59.059 --> 46:00.477
- Yeah.
- I'm amazing.

46:00.602 --> 46:01.687
Chris Gregory's amazing.

46:01.812 --> 46:03.480
I mean, it comes very naturally to you.

46:03.605 --> 46:05.190
Oh. So I'm a natural.

46:05.315 --> 46:07.067
- I'm naturally amazing.
- Oh.

46:07.192 --> 46:09.945
- I'm naturally amazing.
- Oh, my gosh. You are so annoying.

46:10.070 --> 46:12.447
I'm not! This is going better
than I thought it was going to go.

46:12.573 --> 46:14.575
- My gosh. Shut up.
- This is great for me.

46:15.325 --> 46:17.995
This is going so well that you
might have to meet my family

46:18.120 --> 46:20.038
when they come for the Easter break.

46:20.289 --> 46:22.332
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

47:24.645 --> 47:26.188
Whoo!

47:29.942 --> 47:31.818
- There it is!
- Get it, get it!

47:34.488 --> 47:36.907
- Wow.
- What is... What's happening?

47:37.032 --> 47:38.659
Oh, my gosh.

47:38.784 --> 47:41.328
- What is happening?
- Whoo!

47:41.453 --> 47:42.996
I miss my boys!

47:43.121 --> 47:46.833
Oh, you mean you miss Chris and I
dominating John and Dad?

47:47.417 --> 47:49.086
I wouldn't be too quick
to say that, Col.

47:49.211 --> 47:50.796
All right, got Old Man Winkle.

47:53.215 --> 47:55.467
- I got Dad, I got Dad.
- Someone's gonna get hurt!

47:59.680 --> 48:01.765
Are you sure you can handle this?

48:01.890 --> 48:03.100
I have a brother.

48:03.225 --> 48:05.894
No, I mean Chris.
He can be a handful.

48:06.019 --> 48:07.563
Hmm, I think I can handle it.

48:07.688 --> 48:11.316
- You. Man, what's going on with you?
- Looking thin.

48:11.441 --> 48:14.653
By the way, guys,
uh, take a look at this.

48:16.280 --> 48:17.281
What is that?

48:17.823 --> 48:20.158
Oh! You wanna see it?
OK, I'm sorry.

48:21.952 --> 48:24.121
Look, read it... and weep.

48:24.246 --> 48:26.290
- Wow, only took you three years.
- Thank you.

48:26.415 --> 48:28.083
His girlfriend was a big motivation.

48:28.208 --> 48:30.836
I mean, and I even survived
all the lessons, so...

48:30.961 --> 48:32.045
Oh, thanks. Thank you.

48:32.170 --> 48:33.839
- I'm impressed.
- Congratulations.

48:33.964 --> 48:35.841
- That's great.
- How many times did it take?

48:35.966 --> 48:38.468
- Actually, once.
- Let's eat. Come on.

48:38.594 --> 48:40.888
"How many times did it take?"
"It took him three times."

48:41.013 --> 48:43.140
"How many times did it take
to get your license, Chris?"

48:45.976 --> 48:47.269
Behave yourself, OK?

48:47.394 --> 48:49.021
- Yeah, of course. Always.
- I love you.

48:51.231 --> 48:52.482
- This is for you.
- What is this?

48:52.608 --> 48:53.692
- It's a little...
- What? No.

48:53.817 --> 48:56.153
- Take it.
- I don't need your money.

48:56.278 --> 48:57.446
Thanks, Mom.

48:58.280 --> 48:59.156
Mommy.

49:00.657 --> 49:01.783
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

49:01.909 --> 49:03.535
- Take care of your brother.
- I'll try.

49:06.038 --> 49:07.789
Drive safely.

49:07.915 --> 49:09.333
There you go. I love you.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.084
- Bye.
- Bye.

49:13.086 --> 49:14.963
Lovely meeting you.

49:15.088 --> 49:16.298
Thank you.

49:20.093 --> 49:21.428
Thanks for everything, Pop.

49:23.347 --> 49:24.389
I love you.

49:26.099 --> 49:27.809
- Keep your grades up.
- Yeah.

49:30.145 --> 49:31.063
Hear that?

49:31.605 --> 49:33.023
- Have fun.
- Yes.

49:33.148 --> 49:34.816
- Not too much fun.
- Of course not.

49:34.942 --> 49:36.610
- Be good.
- Always.

49:36.735 --> 49:38.278
Bye.

49:38.654 --> 49:39.655
I love you.

49:39.780 --> 49:41.281
- I love you more.
- Love you.

49:41.406 --> 49:42.950
- Bye.
- Oh, my gosh!

49:44.660 --> 49:46.495
Wait! Come back!

49:46.620 --> 49:48.247
Don't leave me!

49:50.832 --> 49:52.167
<i>That was a very good day.</i>

50:10.686 --> 50:12.521
I, Jorge Bolivar...

50:12.646 --> 50:14.523
I, Leslie Folk...

50:14.648 --> 50:16.191
...take you, Leslie Folk...

50:16.316 --> 50:19.319
...take you, Jorge Bolivar...

50:19.444 --> 50:21.071
...to be my lawfully wedded wife...

50:21.196 --> 50:23.198
...to be my lawfully wedded husband...

50:23.323 --> 50:24.700
...for better or for worse...

50:24.825 --> 50:27.160
...for better or for worse...

50:27.286 --> 50:29.329
...in sickness and in health...

50:30.247 --> 50:32.124
...in sickness and in health...

50:33.208 --> 50:34.710
...as long as we both shall live.

50:36.336 --> 50:38.463
...as long as we both shall live.

51:09.828 --> 51:10.871
My wife?

51:14.249 --> 51:15.542
My husband.

51:16.501 --> 51:18.629
Cheers.

51:22.758 --> 51:24.468
What a day, right?

51:24.593 --> 51:27.221
- It was bliss.
- Yeah.

51:28.680 --> 51:30.432
I'm sorry your parents weren't here.

51:30.557 --> 51:33.977
No. Don't be. We don't need the drama.

51:36.313 --> 51:39.858
Today was about us
and our life together.

51:41.026 --> 51:43.237
They'll fall in love with you
just like I did.

51:43.362 --> 51:45.197
Do you promise?

51:46.823 --> 51:48.075
I promise.

51:48.867 --> 51:51.662
My little peanut.

51:56.792 --> 51:57.709
OK.

51:59.419 --> 52:00.504
OK.

52:01.255 --> 52:02.756
You're doing this?

52:02.881 --> 52:06.009
I think it's about time we start
working on those dozens of babies

52:06.134 --> 52:07.594
you've been talking about.

52:07.719 --> 52:09.346
Whoo!

52:09.471 --> 52:12.599
How did I get to be this lucky, huh?
Whoo!

52:27.072 --> 52:28.907
You're almost
getting out of here, Sam.

52:29.032 --> 52:30.909
- Yeah.
- Got any plans after graduation?

52:31.577 --> 52:34.204
Probably intern
at this nonprofit that I like.

52:34.329 --> 52:36.999
Yeah, that's right, my girl's smart.

52:37.124 --> 52:39.167
- Any of that rub off on you?
- Ho-ho!

52:39.293 --> 52:42.796
Yes, actually. I'm thinking about
signing up for the fire department.

52:42.921 --> 52:46.383
- You just wanna play with the siren.
- Yeah, one hundred percent.

52:46.508 --> 52:48.010
Have you heard that thing? Whoo-ooh!

52:48.135 --> 52:50.554
And then hopefully some traveling
at some point, right?

52:50.679 --> 52:53.307
- Yeah, traveling would be real nice.
- Hm-hmm.

52:53.432 --> 52:54.474
- I can see it.
- Whoa!

52:54.600 --> 52:57.144
Blue ocean, me and you, a yacht

52:57.269 --> 52:59.229
just like this. I'm standing here

52:59.354 --> 53:00.898
and you're holding me across my chest

53:01.023 --> 53:03.442
and there's all these tropical fish
and...

53:03.984 --> 53:05.944
all this amazing...

53:07.321 --> 53:11.074
Ignore him. He does this way too often.
Chris, dude, cut it out.

53:11.199 --> 53:12.284
Yeah, Chris.

53:13.035 --> 53:14.953
- Chris!
- Chris, the joke is over.

53:15.579 --> 53:17.748
Why isn't he stopping? Chris?
What's happening?

53:17.873 --> 53:19.374
- Chris!
- Hey!

53:19.499 --> 53:21.168
- Chris!
- Chris! Wake up, Chris!

53:21.293 --> 53:22.753
- Come on, hey!
- Stop kidding around!

53:22.878 --> 53:25.464
Oh, God. Hey, go grab your car!
Go get your car!

53:26.131 --> 53:27.049
Come on, big guy.

53:28.050 --> 53:29.968
Come on, stay with us.

53:31.803 --> 53:33.013
OK, come on.

53:34.598 --> 53:35.599
Chris!

53:36.308 --> 53:37.559
Chris.

53:40.520 --> 53:41.647
No!

53:57.871 --> 53:59.039
Doctor.

54:00.415 --> 54:04.503
The MRI shows bleeding
in the frontal lobe of your son's brain.

54:04.628 --> 54:05.921
There is no sign of trauma,

54:06.046 --> 54:09.007
so it's possible he may have
some type of aneurism

54:09.132 --> 54:11.969
or a bleeding arterial
venous malformation.

54:15.138 --> 54:16.640
Please.

54:16.765 --> 54:18.350
Please don't leave me.

54:19.059 --> 54:20.894
I love you so much.

54:21.812 --> 54:23.313
Please.

54:23.438 --> 54:24.940
Please come back to me.

54:32.030 --> 54:33.240
Sam.

54:33.782 --> 54:35.367
Chris? Chris?

54:35.492 --> 54:38.036
John. John.

54:38.161 --> 54:40.289
Chris? You guys.

54:42.207 --> 54:43.834
- Hey.
- Chris.

54:43.959 --> 54:45.752
Are you good?

54:47.379 --> 54:49.673
I've never felt better, actually.

54:51.550 --> 54:53.260
And that's saying something.

54:54.177 --> 54:55.429
Yeah, he's better, all right.

54:56.430 --> 54:57.973
We thought we lost you.

54:58.098 --> 54:59.600
I had this dream

55:00.517 --> 55:03.604
that I was this caterpillar
trapped in a cocoon.

55:04.980 --> 55:07.024
It was really, really dark inside.

55:08.025 --> 55:10.736
I kept scratching the cocoon,
trying to get out,

55:10.861 --> 55:11.987
but I couldn't get out.

55:12.112 --> 55:14.448
It was like I was stuck,
like I couldn't move my body.

55:14.573 --> 55:16.325
I was so scared.

55:17.659 --> 55:19.870
I didn't think that I
was gonna make it home.

55:20.996 --> 55:22.956
Then I heard your voice.

55:25.125 --> 55:26.960
I started to see like a...

55:27.586 --> 55:30.672
like a light, and I started
to see this way out.

55:32.758 --> 55:37.971
And then... I realized that I was
more than I ever thought I was...

55:39.264 --> 55:43.268
That I was like
this beautiful butterfly.

55:45.896 --> 55:47.814
And I could just fly.

55:48.899 --> 55:51.485
Was there a little dog
named Toto there, too?

55:52.277 --> 55:53.779
A wicked witch?

55:54.404 --> 55:57.115
Yeah. Yeah, there was.

55:57.241 --> 55:58.951
And the witch was your wife.

56:00.869 --> 56:02.829
Hey, your brother
just got out of a coma.

56:02.955 --> 56:04.039
Don't beat him up.

56:05.290 --> 56:08.293
Well, I'm just glad
that you didn't fly away.

56:09.544 --> 56:10.462
Me too.

56:12.923 --> 56:14.299
Careful, careful.

56:16.426 --> 56:19.638
Because there's actually something
that I wanted to ask you.

56:44.997 --> 56:45.998
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:48.166 --> 56:49.167
Dearly beloved,

56:49.293 --> 56:52.462
we are gathered here today
to witness this man, Christopher,

56:52.588 --> 56:55.674
marry this woman, Sam,
in holy matrimony.

56:57.718 --> 56:59.511
You look amazing.

57:00.053 --> 57:01.305
You, too.

57:04.141 --> 57:05.350
Chris.

57:06.143 --> 57:08.061
Oh, um...

57:09.938 --> 57:13.317
I, Chris, take you, Sam,

57:14.276 --> 57:16.236
to be my lawfully wedded wife.

57:19.114 --> 57:23.911
And I, Sam, take you, Chris,
to be my husband.

57:24.369 --> 57:27.331
To have and to hold, this day forward...

57:28.040 --> 57:30.334
...as long as we both shall live.

57:31.793 --> 57:33.337
By the power vested in me,

57:33.462 --> 57:35.589
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

57:36.214 --> 57:38.175
Chris, you may kiss your bride.

58:16.255 --> 58:19.591
<i>Just like that,
the future life Sam talked about</i>

58:19.716 --> 58:21.093
<i>began to come into focus.</i>

59:03.677 --> 59:04.887
<i>It wasn't all that different</i>

59:05.012 --> 59:08.140
<i>from the life that Jorge and Leslie
were living years before.</i>

59:08.265 --> 59:12.102
<i>Moving together by similarity,
separated by time.</i>

59:22.988 --> 59:26.950
Straight away. Close the door.
Home, sweet home.

59:27.075 --> 59:28.785
- I got it.
- You got it?

59:29.494 --> 59:34.541
Home, sweet home, look at it.
Nice, huh? The kitchen.

59:34.666 --> 59:35.667
- Hm-hmm.
- Like it?

59:35.792 --> 59:37.336
- I do.
- Hm-hmm?

59:37.461 --> 59:39.004
Hm-hmm.

59:39.129 --> 59:42.966
You know, there are a couple
of empty rooms to fill.

1:00:24.841 --> 1:00:27.594
<i>But there were some differences
in how our lives played out.</i>

1:00:31.139 --> 1:00:32.724
<i>Painful differences.</i>

1:00:47.656 --> 1:00:49.074
Did you get the job?

1:00:51.410 --> 1:00:53.120
Oh, I knew you would.

1:00:54.913 --> 1:00:56.206
I'm so proud of you.

1:00:56.331 --> 1:00:59.793
- Thank you, thank you.
- Aw!

1:01:00.419 --> 1:01:02.879
- You like the shirt?
- Yes. It's a nice shirt.

1:01:03.005 --> 1:01:04.089
- All right?
- Yeah.

1:01:04.214 --> 1:01:06.049
Yeah, we're gonna be
making the big bucks now,

1:01:06.174 --> 1:01:08.343
so we can make
a couple of changes around here.

1:01:08.468 --> 1:01:11.388
Maybe starting with a shower
I can actually fit in.

1:01:11.513 --> 1:01:14.016
Actually, I think
the first thing we should do

1:01:14.141 --> 1:01:17.102
is put some paint in that front bedroom.

1:01:17.227 --> 1:01:18.604
OK. Yeah, what color?

1:01:18.729 --> 1:01:19.855
Daddy.

1:01:20.272 --> 1:01:22.232
Dad?

1:01:22.357 --> 1:01:23.317
- Hm-hmm.
- Me?

1:01:23.442 --> 1:01:24.484
- Hm-hmm.
- No.

1:01:24.610 --> 1:01:25.777
- Hm-hmm.
- No.

1:01:25.903 --> 1:01:26.862
- Yeah.
- No.

1:01:26.987 --> 1:01:28.322
- No, you're lying.
- Yes. Yes!

1:01:28.447 --> 1:01:30.616
Yes? Oh!

1:01:32.117 --> 1:01:33.368
- What?
- Yes.

1:01:33.493 --> 1:01:35.495
No, I can't.

1:01:36.079 --> 1:01:37.247
Wow.

1:01:38.206 --> 1:01:40.334
Wow, wow, wow.

1:01:40.459 --> 1:01:41.835
- You...?
- Hm-hmm.

1:01:44.630 --> 1:01:46.089
I can't believe it.

1:01:46.715 --> 1:01:47.883
I can't believe it.

1:01:48.008 --> 1:01:49.551
It's crazy.

1:01:52.888 --> 1:01:55.182
- I love you.
- I love you.

1:02:05.943 --> 1:02:08.070
- Is that its...
- No.

1:02:08.195 --> 1:02:10.113
No, that's the umbilical cord.

1:02:11.865 --> 1:02:13.450
Yeah, of course it is.

1:02:17.871 --> 1:02:20.874
I received your results
and I reviewed them,

1:02:20.999 --> 1:02:23.502
and I wish I could give you
better news, but...

1:02:23.627 --> 1:02:27.756
given your medical history,
we're not very optimistic.

1:02:29.675 --> 1:02:32.052
I'm sorry.

1:02:32.177 --> 1:02:35.430
OK. Well, thank you for your time.

1:02:57.369 --> 1:03:00.455
You know, it's my fault.
You never should have married me.

1:03:00.581 --> 1:03:02.165
We don't know that.

1:03:03.959 --> 1:03:05.794
I can't give you what you want.

1:03:05.919 --> 1:03:08.005
I can't give you what you deserve.

1:03:09.423 --> 1:03:10.382
No, my love.

1:03:10.507 --> 1:03:12.843
You said you wanted a big family.

1:03:12.968 --> 1:03:14.803
With dozens and dozens.

1:03:16.930 --> 1:03:18.515
Dozens of babies.

1:03:22.561 --> 1:03:23.979
I failed you.

1:03:27.190 --> 1:03:28.400
Listen to me.

1:03:30.152 --> 1:03:31.653
You're my family.

1:03:32.613 --> 1:03:35.866
You're all I ever wanted
and you're all I need.

1:03:37.451 --> 1:03:39.870
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1:03:40.996 --> 1:03:44.416
And I wouldn't change any of it.

1:03:48.045 --> 1:03:49.463
I'm sorry.

1:03:51.006 --> 1:03:52.466
I'm so sorry.

1:03:58.555 --> 1:04:02.142
Everyone grab your bolster
and find a comfortable seat.

1:04:04.186 --> 1:04:08.190
Now let's close our eyes,
put our hands on our bellies,

1:04:08.315 --> 1:04:11.902
and visualize the connection
to the life within.

1:04:27.042 --> 1:04:28.460
<i>Tío!</i>

1:04:30.796 --> 1:04:31.755
<i>Tío!</i>

1:04:36.593 --> 1:04:38.303
He's getting worse, isn't he?

1:04:40.973 --> 1:04:43.350
We want to make
the most of every moment.

1:04:53.944 --> 1:04:55.737
To the Aliento de Vida.

1:04:58.115 --> 1:04:59.408
The Breath of Life.

1:05:09.376 --> 1:05:12.379
We're gonna take off.
Thank you, guys, for coming.

1:05:13.755 --> 1:05:16.133
He's so perfect.

1:05:16.884 --> 1:05:18.135
I love you so much.

1:05:23.056 --> 1:05:25.183
Hi. Is that Mom?

1:05:33.567 --> 1:05:36.904
OK, we should really go back to shore.

1:05:39.573 --> 1:05:40.574
No.

1:05:41.325 --> 1:05:43.035
Listen, we want you
feeling well, my love.

1:05:43.160 --> 1:05:46.163
No. No, I don't want
anybody worrying about me.

1:05:52.794 --> 1:05:55.005
<i>Tío! Tío,</i> come in!

1:05:57.382 --> 1:05:58.717
Oh! Jorge!

1:06:00.761 --> 1:06:03.764
No. Check his oxygen. OK, I got you.

1:06:03.889 --> 1:06:06.642
Uncle Jorge's gonna be OK. It's OK.

1:06:08.435 --> 1:06:09.436
It's OK.

1:06:14.441 --> 1:06:16.652
I have been in touch
with the Mayo Clinic.

1:06:16.777 --> 1:06:20.072
I'm making arrangements for you
to be screened for a transplant.

1:06:21.531 --> 1:06:22.783
A transplant?

1:06:22.908 --> 1:06:25.786
Without new lungs,
I don't see him lasting another year,

1:06:25.911 --> 1:06:27.621
maybe not even another month.

1:06:27.746 --> 1:06:29.122
To qualify for the procedure,

1:06:29.248 --> 1:06:32.000
you need to be sick enough
where you need it, which you clearly do,

1:06:32.125 --> 1:06:34.836
but healthy enough
to survive the procedure.

1:06:35.671 --> 1:06:37.005
Well, that's good.

1:06:51.353 --> 1:06:52.854
I thought you were sleeping.

1:06:55.774 --> 1:06:57.192
Too many thoughts.

1:06:59.778 --> 1:07:01.905
You should be in bed, my love.

1:07:06.159 --> 1:07:08.328
I have something for you, Peanut.

1:07:09.121 --> 1:07:13.625
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you</i>

1:07:15.836 --> 1:07:20.340
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you</i>

1:07:22.426 --> 1:07:27.264
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Peanut...</i>

1:07:27.389 --> 1:07:30.350
Shh! No, it's not for another month.

1:07:33.645 --> 1:07:36.523
<i>♪ Happy birthday</i>

1:07:36.648 --> 1:07:38.483
<i>♪ To you</i>

1:07:40.152 --> 1:07:41.361
Peanut.

1:07:44.323 --> 1:07:46.533
In case, hmm?

1:07:47.159 --> 1:07:49.828
Shh! Shh!

1:08:00.756 --> 1:08:02.257
- Get it, buddy!
- Yay!

1:08:03.717 --> 1:08:05.802
- What is it?
- What is it?

1:08:05.928 --> 1:08:07.638
Is that a truck?

1:08:07.763 --> 1:08:09.389
It's a fire truck.

1:08:09.514 --> 1:08:11.850
Thank you, Uncle Colin and Uncle John.

1:08:25.072 --> 1:08:26.281
Hello?

1:08:26.406 --> 1:08:27.616
Yes.

1:08:29.159 --> 1:08:30.577
Dr. Keller?

1:08:31.578 --> 1:08:32.954
Tonight?

1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:37.542
Oh, yes, yes, I can arrange that.

1:08:38.126 --> 1:08:42.047
All right, well, I'll call you.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1:08:42.172 --> 1:08:43.215
Oh, my Lord.

1:08:46.842 --> 1:08:48.345
You're not gonna believe this.

1:08:49.887 --> 1:08:51.640
They have a donor for you.

1:08:52.975 --> 1:08:55.060
Jorge, are you all right?

1:08:55.185 --> 1:08:58.438
Because we need to get you
to the clinic as soon as possible.

1:08:59.398 --> 1:09:00.732
Come here.

1:09:02.650 --> 1:09:05.988
I've lived a good life, haven't I?

1:09:06.572 --> 1:09:07.698
What are you saying?

1:09:07.823 --> 1:09:09.949
This doesn't make any sense.

1:09:10.492 --> 1:09:12.911
Should go to someone younger.

1:09:13.036 --> 1:09:14.579
Just, please, stop.

1:09:14.704 --> 1:09:16.873
Someone more deserving.

1:09:17.623 --> 1:09:19.458
I love my life.

1:09:20.127 --> 1:09:22.337
I've been blessed and had so...

1:09:23.171 --> 1:09:24.797
I've had so much.

1:09:27.259 --> 1:09:28.217
I've had you,

1:09:28.342 --> 1:09:29.927
my family.

1:09:30.052 --> 1:09:34.224
Maybe we should go onto the Aliento,

1:09:34.349 --> 1:09:36.226
let whatever happens happen.

1:09:36.351 --> 1:09:41.230
My darling, this is your chance
to finally breathe again.

1:09:41.690 --> 1:09:44.610
And I am right here by your side.

1:09:45.402 --> 1:09:47.362
But you will need to fight again.

1:09:47.487 --> 1:09:50.114
And if you don't fight for yourself,

1:09:50.239 --> 1:09:53.327
I need you to fight for me.

1:09:56.246 --> 1:09:57.497
We can do this.

1:10:00.584 --> 1:10:02.502
That's it, that's it.

1:10:02.628 --> 1:10:04.087
OK.

1:10:04.963 --> 1:10:06.965
- Great.
- Thank you.

1:10:10.886 --> 1:10:15.057
So, Dr. Keller is on his way
to get the lungs.

1:10:15.182 --> 1:10:18.227
You make it sound like
the UPS delivery service.

1:10:21.688 --> 1:10:24.983
You know, this reminds me
of the first time we met.

1:10:28.278 --> 1:10:30.656
I'd feel a lot better
if you hold my hand.

1:10:33.867 --> 1:10:35.535
Always a charmer.

1:10:36.620 --> 1:10:38.038
It worked.

1:10:38.956 --> 1:10:40.582
I got you.

1:10:41.041 --> 1:10:42.876
You don't waste time, do you?

1:10:45.170 --> 1:10:47.172
I don't have time to waste.

1:10:56.014 --> 1:10:57.975
Not your first rodeo.

1:10:58.100 --> 1:11:01.311
No. Hopefully my last.

1:11:12.281 --> 1:11:14.283
This is as far as we can go.

1:11:23.667 --> 1:11:27.254
This will be right here
when you get back.

1:11:28.630 --> 1:11:30.507
- OK.
- You be brave.

1:11:32.217 --> 1:11:33.427
OK?

1:11:34.094 --> 1:11:35.470
OK.

1:11:35.596 --> 1:11:37.264
You be brave.

1:11:53.530 --> 1:11:55.032
Who are these people?

1:11:56.366 --> 1:11:59.328
Families of people waiting
for transplants.

1:12:01.204 --> 1:12:02.998
They've got nowhere to go?

1:12:04.499 --> 1:12:05.792
No.

1:12:10.964 --> 1:12:13.050
- I hope it's not too hard.
- OK.

1:12:13.175 --> 1:12:15.886
- Someone's home.
- Daddy.

1:12:19.348 --> 1:12:21.016
You're looking at the new lieutenant.

1:12:21.141 --> 1:12:22.893
- Really?
- Hm-hmm.

1:12:23.602 --> 1:12:25.020
- Do you hear that?
- Daddy!

1:12:25.145 --> 1:12:26.521
- That's amazing!
- Thank you.

1:12:26.647 --> 1:12:28.232
- Daddy!
- Thank you.

1:12:28.357 --> 1:12:29.524
- Fire truck.
- Yes.

1:12:29.650 --> 1:12:32.569
Wow! Look at this. This is art.

1:12:32.694 --> 1:12:34.821
- This is amazing.
- It's not a fire truck.

1:12:34.947 --> 1:12:38.033
- It's not a fire truck, you're right.
- I'm gonna go run his bath.

1:12:38.158 --> 1:12:39.159
OK.

1:12:40.327 --> 1:12:42.913
- I am so proud of you.
- Thank you.

1:12:43.747 --> 1:12:45.165
This is fine.

1:12:45.916 --> 1:12:48.126
Hey? I wanna look at you.

1:12:48.252 --> 1:12:50.754
Oh! Come here.

1:12:52.547 --> 1:12:53.674
I love fire trucks.

1:12:53.799 --> 1:12:56.134
Yeah, I love fire trucks, too, huh?

1:12:57.678 --> 1:13:01.265
Don't you dare say it.

1:13:01.390 --> 1:13:02.808
I won't say it.

1:13:02.933 --> 1:13:04.017
- Say it.
- Say it?

1:13:04.142 --> 1:13:05.352
- Yeah.
- Fire truck.

1:13:05.477 --> 1:13:08.689
Oh!

1:13:14.570 --> 1:13:16.280
<i>So, here's the thing.</i>

1:13:19.116 --> 1:13:21.743
<i>That's not what really happened.</i>

1:13:27.708 --> 1:13:28.959
<i>It would have been nice.</i>

1:13:30.919 --> 1:13:32.671
<i>Hmm, it would
have been more than nice.</i>

1:13:36.091 --> 1:13:37.467
<i>Perfect wife.</i>

1:13:40.387 --> 1:13:41.930
<i>Perfect family.</i>

1:13:44.474 --> 1:13:45.893
<i>All I could ever want.</i>

1:13:48.020 --> 1:13:49.229
<i>And more.</i>

1:13:57.571 --> 1:14:00.616
<i>But it turns out life had
something else in store for me.</i>

1:14:55.295 --> 1:14:57.756
<i>They ran every test
you can imagine on me.</i>

1:14:59.341 --> 1:15:02.511
<i>CT, MRI, blood,</i>

1:15:02.636 --> 1:15:04.555
<i>oxygen levels, the works.</i>

1:15:05.597 --> 1:15:07.391
<i>And everything seemed to be fine.</i>

1:15:07.516 --> 1:15:09.601
<i>Except for one little thing.</i>

1:15:12.479 --> 1:15:13.981
Doctor.

1:15:15.065 --> 1:15:19.027
The MRI shows bleeding
in the frontal lobe of your son's brain.

1:15:19.152 --> 1:15:20.529
There is no sign of trauma,

1:15:20.654 --> 1:15:23.532
so it's possible he may have
some type of aneurism

1:15:23.657 --> 1:15:26.451
or a bleeding arterial
venous malformation.

1:15:26.577 --> 1:15:28.453
English, please.

1:15:28.579 --> 1:15:32.082
It's basically a leaking blood vessel.

1:15:34.501 --> 1:15:36.295
So, what's next?

1:15:36.420 --> 1:15:39.715
We're planning to drain some fluid
and relieve the pressure on his brain.

1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:42.342
I don't understand.
He was perfectly healthy.

1:15:42.467 --> 1:15:44.177
We just saw him last week.

1:15:44.303 --> 1:15:47.431
About two percent of the population
have this kind of issue

1:15:47.556 --> 1:15:48.724
and never even know it.

1:15:48.849 --> 1:15:52.102
Even if it leaks,
it's not necessarily fatal.

1:15:53.353 --> 1:15:56.648
- Most of the time, it isn't.
- What do you mean, most of the time?

1:15:56.773 --> 1:15:59.067
He just looks like he's sleeping.

1:15:59.192 --> 1:16:00.611
We'll know more in the morning.

1:16:00.736 --> 1:16:03.238
In the meantime,
you should all get some rest.

1:16:03.363 --> 1:16:05.115
There's a hotel down the street.

1:16:15.083 --> 1:16:17.002
Chris, listen to me.

1:16:17.127 --> 1:16:18.921
It's Dad.

1:16:21.131 --> 1:16:22.716
I love you, son.

1:16:25.010 --> 1:16:28.680
Now, put your hand in God's hand, OK?

1:16:29.431 --> 1:16:31.058
Put your hand in God's hand.

1:16:59.586 --> 1:17:01.505
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1:17:01.630 --> 1:17:03.090
We should talk.

1:17:18.981 --> 1:17:23.527
Christopher's condition
has seriously deteriorated overnight.

1:17:26.405 --> 1:17:28.448
I'm afraid
there's no other way to say this.

1:17:29.366 --> 1:17:31.243
This is death.

1:17:31.952 --> 1:17:37.249
We have to do one last test on him
to verify that he is braindead.

1:17:39.960 --> 1:17:42.129
<i>Then we will take him off
all of the machines.</i>

1:17:47.968 --> 1:17:49.386
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1:18:02.608 --> 1:18:05.068
<i>Can we wait until
his brother John gets here?</i>

1:18:05.903 --> 1:18:07.404
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

1:18:09.823 --> 1:18:11.742
<i>We can wait until you're ready.</i>

1:18:44.733 --> 1:18:46.902
We can't actually allow for this.

1:18:47.611 --> 1:18:49.821
They're gonna give parts of him away.

1:18:50.322 --> 1:18:51.782
Like a junked car?

1:18:52.157 --> 1:18:54.701
- Honey.
- No, I'm not OK with this.

1:18:55.244 --> 1:18:56.912
Mom, you can't agree to this, can you?

1:18:57.037 --> 1:18:58.580
It's what he wanted.

1:19:48.338 --> 1:19:50.132
Hey, big little brother.

1:19:52.676 --> 1:19:57.222
Usually, every time we're alone,
you do most of the talking.

1:19:59.725 --> 1:20:01.643
I'm not used to this.

1:20:03.270 --> 1:20:05.814
Where's your wisecrack jokes
when I need them, huh?

1:20:07.524 --> 1:20:09.484
I know I give you a hard time...

1:20:10.444 --> 1:20:11.820
most of the time.

1:20:13.405 --> 1:20:16.700
"Work harder, study stronger."

1:20:18.285 --> 1:20:20.245
What does it even matter now, huh?

1:20:26.752 --> 1:20:28.128
I am sorry...

1:20:29.588 --> 1:20:31.423
for so many things.

1:20:33.967 --> 1:20:35.010
You know, it's...

1:20:35.886 --> 1:20:37.679
You know, it's because I love you.

1:20:38.222 --> 1:20:39.514
Right?

1:20:41.016 --> 1:20:42.267
Chris...

1:20:44.061 --> 1:20:45.479
Look, I need you to hear me.

1:20:47.648 --> 1:20:49.233
I love you.

1:20:52.945 --> 1:20:54.446
And I'm proud...

1:20:56.156 --> 1:20:57.783
proud to be your big brother.

1:21:02.079 --> 1:21:03.080
Bye, buddy.

1:21:15.425 --> 1:21:19.680
Mr. Gregory, there are planes
flying all over the country tonight

1:21:19.805 --> 1:21:21.557
because of your boy.

1:21:21.682 --> 1:21:26.103
We have matches for
all the abdominal and thoracic organs.

1:21:26.228 --> 1:21:30.023
Heart, lungs, liver, pancreas,

1:21:30.607 --> 1:21:32.818
kidneys, and eyes.

1:21:33.443 --> 1:21:36.613
Your son is saving five lives.

1:21:36.738 --> 1:21:38.365
Will we, uh...

1:21:39.825 --> 1:21:41.743
Will we ever find out who they are?

1:21:43.787 --> 1:21:45.122
<i>Maybe someday.</i>

1:21:46.582 --> 1:21:48.125
<i>Who knows?</i>

1:21:48.250 --> 1:21:49.835
<i>Maybe you'll get a letter.</i>

1:21:51.044 --> 1:21:52.379
<i>Maybe not.</i>

1:21:54.965 --> 1:21:58.886
<i>Sometimes folks write,
sometimes families meet.</i>

1:22:01.263 --> 1:22:02.973
<i>It isn't easy.</i>

1:22:03.098 --> 1:22:04.558
<i>But it can happen.</i>

1:22:05.851 --> 1:22:09.104
<i>Only through the agency, though.
No names or addresses are shared.</i>

1:22:09.229 --> 1:22:11.273
<i>Just general age, sex, and location.</i>

1:22:11.398 --> 1:22:14.818
<i>But... I wouldn't expect too much.</i>

1:22:15.694 --> 1:22:17.863
<i>They've all been fighting
their own battles.</i>

1:22:20.240 --> 1:22:21.950
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:22:24.411 --> 1:22:25.787
Thank you.

1:23:08.247 --> 1:23:10.249
Thank you so much for being here.

1:23:12.501 --> 1:23:15.420
My family and I appreciate
your prayers for Chris.

1:23:16.546 --> 1:23:19.758
If there's anything
you could do for us, it's, uh...

1:23:20.509 --> 1:23:21.718
it's this.

1:23:28.392 --> 1:23:30.269
Before you go to sleep tonight,

1:23:33.230 --> 1:23:35.357
please call someone you love
and tell them.

1:23:40.028 --> 1:23:41.613
Call a friend.

1:23:43.532 --> 1:23:46.034
Or a relative
you haven't talked to in a while.

1:24:01.174 --> 1:24:04.469
And don't ask them about
their grades or their cellphone bill.

1:24:09.641 --> 1:24:11.268
Just tell them...

1:24:12.394 --> 1:24:13.896
how much you love them.

1:24:17.441 --> 1:24:19.443
Thank you all for coming.

1:24:19.568 --> 1:24:20.986
Thank you.

1:24:53.393 --> 1:24:54.770
I'm alive.

1:24:58.523 --> 1:25:00.609
I'm alive. I'm...

1:25:03.237 --> 1:25:04.821
I'm alive.

1:25:07.991 --> 1:25:10.619
Who's... who's in here breathing for me?

1:25:11.161 --> 1:25:14.206
An angel. That's all we know.

1:25:22.965 --> 1:25:24.299
OK.

1:25:26.093 --> 1:25:28.053
OK.

1:25:33.892 --> 1:25:35.185
Yes.

1:26:35.495 --> 1:26:39.708
The souls of the righteous
are in the hand of God.

1:26:40.292 --> 1:26:42.294
And no torment shall touch them.

1:26:44.504 --> 1:26:46.632
In the eyes of the foolish,

1:26:47.257 --> 1:26:48.467
they seem to have died,

1:26:49.384 --> 1:26:53.513
their departure
thought to be an affliction

1:26:53.639 --> 1:26:55.641
and their going from us
to be their destruction.

1:26:55.766 --> 1:26:58.393
But they are at peace.

1:27:01.688 --> 1:27:04.858
For though, in the sight of men,
they were punished,

1:27:04.983 --> 1:27:07.778
their hope is full of immortality.

1:27:26.922 --> 1:27:30.300
I will always love you.

1:28:34.281 --> 1:28:35.240
Oh.

1:28:35.365 --> 1:28:36.950
The nurses are calling him Superman.

1:28:37.868 --> 1:28:39.494
No one can believe
how well you're recovering.

1:28:39.620 --> 1:28:41.580
I feel half my age, Doctor.

1:28:42.456 --> 1:28:44.041
Who was he?

1:28:44.166 --> 1:28:46.919
I can't release
that kind of information.

1:28:47.044 --> 1:28:49.713
We need to know. Please.

1:28:50.631 --> 1:28:54.676
I will check with the organ agency
and see what they'll release.

1:28:54.801 --> 1:28:57.721
But I think we should
get you home first.

1:29:04.728 --> 1:29:06.063
Thank you.

1:29:06.188 --> 1:29:07.481
You're welcome.

1:29:30.712 --> 1:29:32.631
It's handwritten, and, uh...

1:29:32.756 --> 1:29:35.676
they blacked out his name
and his signature.

1:29:36.635 --> 1:29:38.095
Read it.

1:29:44.518 --> 1:29:46.853
"To whoever and his family.

1:29:46.979 --> 1:29:49.898
I understand I am
the recipient of a gift

1:29:50.023 --> 1:29:53.360
from a relative of yours
that is beyond repayment.

1:29:57.823 --> 1:30:01.076
I cannot imagine the grief
caused by your loss

1:30:01.201 --> 1:30:07.291
and there are no words anyone can say
or write to extinguish that pain.

1:30:09.668 --> 1:30:15.632
Nevertheless, you have shared with me
the grandest gift I will ever receive.

1:30:17.009 --> 1:30:18.552
The gift of life."

1:30:52.586 --> 1:30:53.754
Grace.

1:30:53.879 --> 1:30:55.297
Honey, come here.

1:30:56.757 --> 1:30:57.841
What?

1:30:58.550 --> 1:30:59.676
Uh...

1:31:00.636 --> 1:31:02.888
They gave Christopher a name.

1:31:03.013 --> 1:31:04.598
What is it?

1:31:05.390 --> 1:31:06.850
Gabriel.

1:31:08.560 --> 1:31:11.730
The archangel of new life
and incarnation.

1:31:12.773 --> 1:31:13.690
Our boy.

1:31:14.858 --> 1:31:16.235
Their angel.

1:31:16.818 --> 1:31:18.362
Gabriel.

1:31:51.770 --> 1:31:54.481
Gabriel was
their 19-year-old son Christopher.

1:31:55.607 --> 1:31:57.818
He was in love with a girl named Sam.

1:32:01.613 --> 1:32:03.282
The parents lost their son

1:32:03.865 --> 1:32:05.826
and she lost her love.

1:32:08.287 --> 1:32:10.205
He was just a boy, you know.

1:32:14.835 --> 1:32:16.545
He was just a boy.

1:33:58.146 --> 1:33:59.481
Chris is here.

1:34:00.107 --> 1:34:01.775
He's with me.

1:34:13.453 --> 1:34:15.205
I'm going to take good care of him.

1:34:15.831 --> 1:34:17.124
Thank you.

1:34:23.797 --> 1:34:25.382
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Grace.

1:34:25.507 --> 1:34:26.675
Hi.

1:34:27.217 --> 1:34:28.719
Nice to meet you.

1:34:58.624 --> 1:35:01.376
<i>Go ahead, take my eyes.</i>

1:35:01.501 --> 1:35:03.086
<i>They're no use to me now.</i>

1:35:03.921 --> 1:35:06.798
<i>But just know that when they look
at some little children playing,</i>

1:35:06.924 --> 1:35:08.634
<i>I'll be smiling with them.</i>

1:35:11.136 --> 1:35:14.306
<i>Take my heart so someone else
can live and love and...</i>

1:35:15.182 --> 1:35:19.228
<i>with this gift, know that my love
remains in this world.</i>

1:35:22.814 --> 1:35:25.400
<i>Take my lungs so someone else can sing.</i>

1:35:26.652 --> 1:35:29.947
<i>And if you listen carefully,
you'll hear that I'm singing with them.</i>

1:35:43.168 --> 1:35:47.172
<i>I'm sorry I didn't have more hugs
to give and jokes to tell.</i>

1:35:48.590 --> 1:35:50.717
<i>I did my best to make others smile.</i>

1:35:53.011 --> 1:35:57.057
<i>And when I die, I won't be here.</i>

1:35:58.267 --> 1:35:59.810
<i>I'll be everywhere.</i>

1:36:12.864 --> 1:36:14.324
<i>So, that's my story.</i>

1:36:14.449 --> 1:36:17.452
<i>And it didn't happen the way
any of us would have expected.</i>

1:36:18.495 --> 1:36:20.163
<i>But it was a miracle.</i>

1:36:20.914 --> 1:36:23.792
<i>Beautiful, awesome and fantastic.</i>
