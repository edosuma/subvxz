00:03.086 --> 00:06.548
Mom, Dad, guess what.

00:03.086 --> 00:06.548
The Tooth Fairy came.

00:06.590 --> 00:08.091
He did?

00:08.133 --> 00:10.302
Oh! So what'd he give

00:08.133 --> 00:10.302
you-- a couple dollars?

00:10.344 --> 00:12.554
I got a rock

00:10.344 --> 00:12.554
and half a stick of gum.

00:13.555 --> 00:14.932

Watch this, Francis-- I can make

00:50.551 --> 00:53.595
milk come out of either nostril.

00:53.637 --> 00:56.348
He's gotten pretty good

00:53.637 --> 00:56.348
at this.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.684
It's sad, but I'm actually

00:56.390 --> 00:58.684
kind of jealous.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.728
Reese, anything coming out

00:58.726 --> 01:00.728
of your nose

01:00.769 --> 01:02.730
is going right back

01:00.769 --> 01:02.730
in your mouth.

01:02.771 --> 01:06.107
This corner of my waffle's

01:02.771 --> 01:06.107
still frozen.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.317
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

01:07.359 --> 01:08.986
I had to put Francis' waffle

01:07.359 --> 01:08.986
on top,

01:09.028 --> 01:10.571
and that toaster oven

01:09.028 --> 01:10.571
just isn't big enough.

01:12.031 --> 01:15.993
It's your fault my

01:12.031 --> 01:15.993
waffle's frozen?

01:16.035 --> 01:17.995
Sorry.

01:18.037 --> 01:19.705
Francis, you'd better get

01:18.037 --> 01:19.705
moving. You don't want

01:19.747 --> 01:21.498
to be late for your

01:19.747 --> 01:21.498
first day of inventory.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.751
Oh, yeah, Mom. Thanks again

01:21.540 --> 01:23.751
for getting me that job.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.335
Some of the guys

01:25.377 --> 01:27.295
are spending their spring break

01:25.377 --> 01:27.295
river rafting.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.965
You wouldn't believe how jealous

01:27.337 --> 01:29.965
they were when they heard I was

01:30.007 --> 01:32.133
going to be counting shampoo

01:30.007 --> 01:32.133
bottles at the Lucky Aide.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.219
Sorry, Francis,

01:32.175 --> 01:34.219
but it's the perfect fit:

01:34.261 --> 01:36.221
we needed people

01:34.261 --> 01:36.221
and you have no choice.

01:36.263 --> 01:39.349
Hey! Look at the

01:36.263 --> 01:39.349
sexy professor!

01:39.391 --> 01:42.185
Dad, you're bringing all

01:39.391 --> 01:42.185
that junk to Dewey's class?

01:42.227 --> 01:43.311
Yes, I am, Malcolm.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.772
This is my first

01:43.353 --> 01:44.772
Career Day.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.314
I want to make sure

01:44.813 --> 01:46.314
I dazzle 'em!

01:46.356 --> 01:49.026
I want Dewey to be proud

01:46.356 --> 01:49.026
of his old man.

01:49.068 --> 01:51.152
One out of four

01:49.068 --> 01:51.152
wouldn't be so bad.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.863
Dad, they're six years old.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.322
Which is why we have

01:52.905 --> 01:54.322
to keep things moving.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.616
We'll start

01:54.364 --> 01:55.616
with the pie chart,

01:55.657 --> 01:56.951
then move to

01:55.657 --> 01:56.951
Earnings Index.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.326
Do I have to do this?

01:58.368 --> 02:00.161
Relax, Malcolm.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.161
Your teacher

01:58.368 --> 02:00.161
said it's fine.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.163
You'll just make up what

02:00.203 --> 02:02.163
you miss after school.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.833
You know, I am really

02:02.205 --> 02:04.833
looking forward to this.

02:04.875 --> 02:08.378
I think this is going to be

02:04.875 --> 02:08.378
a lot of fun.

02:08.420 --> 02:12.049
Well, no, that's not, not

02:08.420 --> 02:12.049
all I do.

02:12.091 --> 02:14.802
I, uh, there are some,

02:12.091 --> 02:14.802
you know, important

02:14.843 --> 02:16.470
and, uh, very, uh,

02:16.511 --> 02:19.180
interesting...

02:19.222 --> 02:21.182
Could you repeat the question?

02:21.224 --> 02:23.018
Your job sounds awful.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.771
(laughs) Well, of course

02:23.060 --> 02:25.771
it's awful; it's a job.

02:25.813 --> 02:26.647
You know...

02:26.688 --> 02:28.356
He's tanking.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.567
He's way

02:28.398 --> 02:30.567
past tanking.

02:30.609 --> 02:34.488
See, you, you kids have to

02:30.609 --> 02:34.488
realize that all jobs are awful

02:34.529 --> 02:36.782
and there's nothing

02:34.529 --> 02:36.782
that you can do about that.

02:36.824 --> 02:40.577
I mean, they're, they're

02:36.824 --> 02:40.577
tedious and boring.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.287
Being a fireman

02:40.619 --> 02:42.287
isn't boring.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.498
True, but you have to take

02:42.329 --> 02:44.498
into consideration

02:44.539 --> 02:46.207
the high mortality rate.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.209
It's real easy to get killed

02:46.249 --> 02:48.209
in a fire.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.586
My daddy's a fireman.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.254
Pete's daddy's

02:49.628 --> 02:51.254
going to die?

02:51.296 --> 02:54.173
Oh, and I'm sure he's probably

02:51.296 --> 02:54.173
going to be fine.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.218
So the only reason

02:55.258 --> 02:57.218
you like your job

02:57.260 --> 02:59.262
is because you won't

02:57.260 --> 02:59.262
get killed in a fire?

02:59.304 --> 03:01.222
Yes.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.224
Well, actually, you see...

03:03.266 --> 03:05.226
you see, I-I work

03:03.266 --> 03:05.226
on a very high floor,

03:05.268 --> 03:08.147
so that's not necessarily true.

03:08.229 --> 03:10.024
Any other questions?

03:10.065 --> 03:12.609
If your job is so boring

03:10.065 --> 03:12.609
and you don't like it

03:12.651 --> 03:13.986
why do you do it?

03:15.487 --> 03:17.238
You quit your job?

03:17.280 --> 03:18.239
Lois, please,

03:17.280 --> 03:18.239
give me

03:18.281 --> 03:19.616
a little more

03:18.281 --> 03:19.616
credit than that.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.242
No, I asked for

03:19.658 --> 03:21.242
a leave of absence

03:21.284 --> 03:23.078
because of a

03:21.284 --> 03:23.078
kidney malfunction.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.038
Nice.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.664
Drastic but vague

03:24.079 --> 03:25.664
enough to discourage

03:25.706 --> 03:27.248
any follow-up questions.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.750
Way to go.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.252
You're doing this because

03:28.792 --> 03:31.252
of what a seven-year-old said?

03:31.294 --> 03:33.296
It was horrible.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.296
He made Dad cry.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.923
This kid was ruthless...

03:34.965 --> 03:36.133
but fair.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.426
His  dad did a puppet show.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.428
I'll tell you boys,

03:38.468 --> 03:40.428
life is crazy.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.639
One day you're

03:40.470 --> 03:42.639
in community college

03:42.681 --> 03:43.891
driving a Camaro T-top,

03:43.932 --> 03:45.142
cock of the walk,

03:45.184 --> 03:47.268
and then you need some cash,

03:45.184 --> 03:47.268
so you get a job.

03:47.310 --> 03:50.313
You think it's only temporary,

03:47.310 --> 03:50.313
but then you get a promotion

03:50.355 --> 03:51.272
and then a raise,

03:51.314 --> 03:52.941
and all these doors

03:51.314 --> 03:52.941
open up for you,

03:52.983 --> 03:55.318
except they're not really doors.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.318
They're trapdoors.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.154
And then all of a sudden--

03:57.196 --> 04:00.991
bam! 20 years has zipped by,

03:57.196 --> 04:00.991
and you're thinking,

04:01.033 --> 04:03.451
"Is this all I have to my life?"

04:03.493 --> 04:05.204
Not you kids.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.706
I love you kids, but, come on--

04:05.245 --> 04:07.706
the house-- it's crap.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.708
Boys, I want to talk

04:07.748 --> 04:09.708
to your father alone.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.044
So, you've got a

04:09.750 --> 04:12.044
bedroom. We're eating.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.254
Just kidding, we're leaving.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.135
Hal...

04:20.177 --> 04:22.303
is this a midlife crisis?

04:22.345 --> 04:23.972
I don't know what it is.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.974
I-I-- it-- I just know

04:24.014 --> 04:25.974
that I had to do something.

04:26.016 --> 04:29.310
And what is it exactly

04:26.016 --> 04:29.310
you plan on doing?

04:29.352 --> 04:31.146
What I have always

04:29.352 --> 04:31.146
talked about doing...

04:31.188 --> 04:33.314
a thing that has been

04:31.188 --> 04:33.314
in my head for years.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.315
The painting?

04:34.357 --> 04:36.235
Yes, I-I-I can see

04:34.357 --> 04:36.235
it so clearly.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.945
Every line, every streak,

04:37.986 --> 04:40.488
every daub.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.157
The blazing

04:40.530 --> 04:42.157
crimson flushes,

04:42.199 --> 04:43.700
the vivid blue tones.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.619
The almost subliminal

04:43.742 --> 04:45.619
tinges of tangerine.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.495
Yes, Hal, I have heard

04:45.660 --> 04:47.495
this before, but...

04:47.537 --> 04:50.373
Lois, I got to get

04:47.537 --> 04:50.373
this out of my head.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.333
Do you know how crazy this is?

04:50.415 --> 04:52.333
Yeah.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.377
You were going to save

04:52.375 --> 04:54.377
the painting until retirement,

04:54.419 --> 04:56.004
when it's okay to be insane.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.589
Hal, I was really

04:56.046 --> 04:57.589
looking forward

04:57.631 --> 04:59.800
to that old painter guy

04:57.631 --> 04:59.800
puttering around the house

04:59.841 --> 05:01.802
with a little old spot

04:59.841 --> 05:01.802
of paint on his cheek.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.555
I'm sorry, baby, I just,

05:01.843 --> 05:05.555
I just can't wait anymore.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.349
Maybe I can be the

05:05.597 --> 05:08.349
old gardener guy.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.727
Okay.

05:10.769 --> 05:11.979
Yes? Really? Yes?

05:12.020 --> 05:13.563
This is important to you,

05:13.605 --> 05:14.856
and up until

05:13.605 --> 05:14.856
about five minutes ago

05:14.898 --> 05:16.566
you were a very good

05:14.898 --> 05:16.566
husband and father.

05:16.608 --> 05:17.442
You deserve this.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.820
Oh, thank you.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.529
You  deserve something

05:19.861 --> 05:21.529
really great.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.364
I really wish I could

05:21.571 --> 05:23.364
buy it for you,

05:23.406 --> 05:25.366
but I'm going to be

05:23.406 --> 05:25.366
digging pretty deep

05:25.408 --> 05:27.202
into the savings

05:25.408 --> 05:27.202
for art supplies.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.038
Thank you.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.373
Congratulations, people.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.626
You have all passed

05:32.415 --> 05:34.626
the rigorous Lucky Aide

05:34.668 --> 05:36.377
inventory screening process.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.839
You should be proud.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.839
This is a great crew.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.841
(speaks foreign language)

05:40.882 --> 05:43.384
We've done a few trust

05:40.882 --> 05:43.384
games, some stretches.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.970
Now we're ready for battle.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.387
As I already explained,

05:46.429 --> 05:49.308
corporate has us pitted

05:46.429 --> 05:49.308
against the downtown store.

05:49.348 --> 05:52.978
First one to finish inventory

05:49.348 --> 05:52.978
gets a plaque and a hundred...

05:53.020 --> 05:54.395
a plaque.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.772
Yes, a question.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.399
Yes, which household product

05:55.814 --> 05:58.399
will kill me fastest?

05:58.441 --> 06:01.028
We're going to start you off

05:58.441 --> 06:01.028
counting the cotton swabs.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.904
Bleach...

06:01.069 --> 06:02.904
or oven cleaner

06:02.946 --> 06:07.201
or Rat Grenade.

06:02.946 --> 06:07.201
Rat Grenade's good.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.660
It's weird.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.412
All my life, Dad's been getting

06:08.702 --> 06:11.412
up every morning

06:11.454 --> 06:13.707
and dragging himself to a job

06:11.454 --> 06:13.707
that he despised

06:13.748 --> 06:15.416
with every fiber of his being.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.418
I can't believe I never noticed.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.378
I guess I've been

06:17.460 --> 06:19.378
pretty self-centered.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.424
Oh, my God!

06:23.466 --> 06:25.426
What if that happens to me?

06:25.468 --> 06:27.428
Two quarts of

06:25.468 --> 06:27.428
amber varnish.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.430
A number two

06:27.470 --> 06:29.430
camel hair brush.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.932
Or maybe a

06:29.472 --> 06:30.932
Kalinsky sable.

06:30.974 --> 06:33.060
Camel hair brush,

06:30.974 --> 06:33.060
Kalinsky sable.

06:33.101 --> 06:35.354
How do you know

06:33.101 --> 06:35.354
about all this stuff?

06:35.394 --> 06:37.856
You never painted

06:35.394 --> 06:37.856
anything in your life.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.901
I have been painting

06:37.898 --> 06:40.901
this for 15 years, Lois...

06:40.942 --> 06:42.527
up here.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.071
Oh, hi, honey.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.906
Do you people

06:44.112 --> 06:45.906
have any idea

06:45.947 --> 06:49.492
what this kind of mindless

06:45.947 --> 06:49.492
labor does to a person?

06:49.534 --> 06:51.036
It kills your soul.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.038
It turns your

06:51.078 --> 06:53.038
mind into jelly

06:53.080 --> 06:55.456
and it crushes

06:53.080 --> 06:55.456
your spirit to dust.

06:55.498 --> 06:58.459
Oh, Craig called. He

06:55.498 --> 06:58.459
wants you there tomorrow

06:55.498 --> 06:58.459
at 7:00 instead of 8:00.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.171
Oh, and can you keep it down

06:58.501 --> 07:01.171
when you get up in the morning?

07:01.213 --> 07:02.381
I'm sleeping in.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.152
So, Malcolm, word

07:22.234 --> 07:24.152
on the street is

07:24.194 --> 07:25.904
your father wigged

07:24.194 --> 07:25.904
out at work.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.364
What?

07:27.406 --> 07:29.490
Did he really set

07:27.406 --> 07:29.490
his desk on fire

07:27.406 --> 07:29.490
and dance around it?

07:29.532 --> 07:31.159
I  heard it was

07:29.532 --> 07:31.159
a lovers' quarrel

07:31.201 --> 07:32.202
with the cleaning lady.

07:32.244 --> 07:33.494
That's crazy.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.538
Where are you guys hearing

07:33.536 --> 07:35.538
all this stuff?

07:37.582 --> 07:38.959
My dad's fine.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.211
He's just taking

07:39.000 --> 07:41.211
some time off from work

07:41.253 --> 07:42.712
because he hates

07:41.253 --> 07:42.712
his job.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.589
You know, it's actually

07:42.754 --> 07:44.589
kind of got me thinking.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.507
What am I going to do

07:44.631 --> 07:46.507
when I grow up?

07:46.549 --> 07:48.509
(Krelboynes gasping)

07:48.551 --> 07:50.178
You mean you don't

07:48.551 --> 07:50.178
have a plan in place?

07:50.220 --> 07:51.138
No.

07:51.179 --> 07:54.141
That's okay, Malcolm.

07:54.182 --> 07:57.352
I mean, it's not too...

07:57.394 --> 07:59.729
Excuse me, allergies.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.606
You guys  already  have

07:59.771 --> 08:01.606
your careers planned?

08:01.648 --> 08:03.442
You don't just  luck  into

08:03.483 --> 08:05.902
running a particle

08:03.483 --> 08:05.902
accelerator, you know.

08:05.944 --> 08:09.323
With my intelligence...

08:09.364 --> 08:11.532
and tokenism...

08:11.574 --> 08:12.742
the sky's...

08:12.784 --> 08:14.494
the limit.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.802
(groans)

08:33.596 --> 08:35.556
(groans)

08:35.598 --> 08:36.557
Okay.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.558
How many is that?

08:37.600 --> 08:38.768
Oobin keitch.

08:38.810 --> 08:41.271
Write it down.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.566
That's a number?

08:45.608 --> 08:47.861
Where are you from?

08:47.902 --> 08:50.489
Red alert!

08:47.902 --> 08:50.489
Everyone gather 'round.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.741
People, my sources tell me

08:50.530 --> 08:53.741
that downtown found

08:53.783 --> 08:55.576
some Rain Man-type

08:53.783 --> 08:55.576
human calculator

08:55.618 --> 08:56.828
at a homeless shelter.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.579
Now, I hear

08:56.870 --> 08:58.579
he's prone to tantrums,

08:58.621 --> 09:00.040
but we can't count on that.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.583
So I'm going to need everyone

09:00.081 --> 09:02.583
to work late tonight.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.585
Oh, Francis?

09:04.627 --> 09:07.005
The loose candy bin count looks

09:04.627 --> 09:07.005
a bit hinky to me.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.632
I want you to double-check

09:07.047 --> 09:09.632
the malt balls.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.594
Should I start with

09:11.634 --> 09:13.594
the 40 in your belly?

09:13.636 --> 09:15.763
I heard that

09:15.805 --> 09:18.058
and I'm paying for those.

09:18.099 --> 09:22.229
Things are starting to get

09:18.099 --> 09:22.229
really strange around here.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.398
It's Dad, he's so... happy.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.107
Mmm, this meat loaf

09:24.439 --> 09:26.107
is incredible.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.317
New recipe?

09:27.359 --> 09:28.609
Same as it's always been.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.487
Oh, come on,

09:28.651 --> 09:30.487
something's

09:28.651 --> 09:30.487
different.

09:30.529 --> 09:31.612
I can tell.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.240
Oh, actually,

09:31.654 --> 09:33.240
you know what?

09:33.281 --> 09:35.325
I was out of tomato paste,

09:33.281 --> 09:35.325
and I used

09:35.367 --> 09:37.244
ketchup instead.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.244
Uh-huh, see?

09:35.367 --> 09:37.244
I could taste it.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.454
It's good, isn't it, kiddo?

09:39.496 --> 09:41.248
What's the matter, son?

09:41.289 --> 09:44.418
A girl at school

09:41.289 --> 09:44.418
called me "Ewey Dewey."

09:44.459 --> 09:45.668
This is the same girl who puts

09:45.710 --> 09:47.628
paste in your hair

09:45.710 --> 09:47.628
all the time, isn't it?

09:47.670 --> 09:49.630
Mm-hmm, well,

09:47.670 --> 09:49.630
you know, she's just

09:47.670 --> 09:49.630
doing this because

09:49.672 --> 09:52.592
she likes you. It's her way

09:49.672 --> 09:52.592
of getting your attention.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.636
So she doesn't think I'm ewey?

09:55.678 --> 09:57.347
No, of course not.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.268
He's right.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.268
Hmm.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.103
Hey, Dad?

10:01.309 --> 10:03.103
Hmm.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.812
I have a little situation that

10:03.144 --> 10:04.812
maybe you can help me out with.

10:04.854 --> 10:05.688
There's this girl who's...

10:04.854 --> 10:05.688
I suggest

10:05.730 --> 10:06.940
that you leave her alone

10:06.981 --> 10:08.649
before she calls

10:06.981 --> 10:08.649
the police on you.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.486
Okay, thanks.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.448
What's wrong?

10:14.489 --> 10:15.698
What do you mean?

10:15.740 --> 10:18.118
Well, I noticed you

10:15.740 --> 10:18.118
looking at me.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.660
Nothing.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.122
See? It's creepy.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.082
You know, Hal,

10:22.163 --> 10:24.082
I got to admit it.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.917
Not working

10:24.124 --> 10:25.917
has really been good for you.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.502
You seem so much happier,

10:27.544 --> 10:29.670
so much more attentive,

10:27.544 --> 10:29.670
tuned in to the boys.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.977
Hal...

10:44.018 --> 10:45.728
My God, you're beautiful.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.712
CRAIG:

11:08.751 --> 11:11.712
Okay, team,

11:08.751 --> 11:11.712
you did a great job yesterday.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.090
Unfortunately,

11:11.754 --> 11:14.090
I lost all the numbers.

11:14.132 --> 11:17.552
I think I accidentally

11:14.132 --> 11:17.552
mailed them to my mom.

11:17.594 --> 11:18.428
(all groaning)

11:18.470 --> 11:19.804
Yeah, so... whoops.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.806
So why don't you guys

11:19.846 --> 11:21.806
start recounting?

11:21.848 --> 11:23.933
I'm going to head

11:21.848 --> 11:23.933
to the downtown store

11:23.975 --> 11:26.978
and play a little "defense,"

11:23.975 --> 11:26.978
if you know what I'm saying.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.648
Uh... Garkech,

11:27.020 --> 11:29.648
you're in charge.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.983
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

11:29.730 --> 11:31.983
you're putting him in charge?

11:32.025 --> 11:33.527
He doesn't speak English.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.736
We don't even know

11:33.568 --> 11:35.736
if Garkech is really his name.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.738
We don't know that it's not.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.740
Besides, he hasn't questioned

11:37.780 --> 11:39.740
every decision I've made.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.742
That's because he can't.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.244
And what happened

11:41.784 --> 11:43.244
to our lunch break?

11:43.286 --> 11:44.663
CRAIG:

11:43.286 --> 11:44.663
I can't hear you.

11:44.703 --> 11:46.747
Thought you might be

11:44.703 --> 11:46.747
ready for some aspirin.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.749
I'm working for a moron.

11:48.791 --> 11:49.750
Of course you are, honey.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.127
Your boss is an idiot,

11:51.169 --> 11:52.753
your coworkers

11:51.169 --> 11:52.753
are incompetent,

11:52.795 --> 11:54.381
and you are

11:52.795 --> 11:54.381
underappreciated.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.923
Welcome to the

11:54.422 --> 11:55.923
working world.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.758
How do people do it?

11:57.800 --> 11:59.260
Well, let's see...

11:59.302 --> 12:00.761
If you want to eat,

11:59.302 --> 12:00.761
sleep indoors,

12:00.803 --> 12:02.597
you know,

12:00.803 --> 12:02.597
those kinds of luxuries,

12:02.639 --> 12:04.349
you really don't have

12:02.639 --> 12:04.349
much of a choice.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.434
What about Dad?

12:04.391 --> 12:06.434
He had a choice.

12:06.476 --> 12:09.020
Every 20 years,

12:06.476 --> 12:09.020
you're allowed a

12:06.476 --> 12:09.020
two-week breakdown.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.938
Oh, I can't wait.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.358
(whispering)

12:13.400 --> 12:16.069
He says, "Get back to work!"

12:16.110 --> 12:17.696
I really appreciate

12:17.736 --> 12:19.822
your letting me take

12:17.736 --> 12:19.822
this vocational exam.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.782
I know it's generally

12:19.864 --> 12:21.782
for older kids.

12:21.824 --> 12:24.285
I just felt like

12:21.824 --> 12:24.285
I really needed some help.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.454
I don't want to make

12:24.327 --> 12:26.454
a wrong decision.

12:26.496 --> 12:29.416
Well... did you get

12:26.496 --> 12:29.416
the test results?

12:29.457 --> 12:30.791
Oh, yes.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.793
What did they say I should do?

12:32.835 --> 12:35.796
Well... according to this...

12:35.838 --> 12:38.258
absolutely anything you want.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.426
What?

12:39.467 --> 12:40.719
Yeah, you-you scored

12:40.759 --> 12:42.512
equally excellent in all areas.

12:42.554 --> 12:43.804
According

12:42.554 --> 12:43.804
to this test,

12:43.846 --> 12:46.057
there isn't a career

12:43.846 --> 12:46.057
on the planet

12:46.099 --> 12:47.267
you wouldn't be great at.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.102
Congratulations.

12:49.143 --> 12:52.188
Well, that... that doesn't

12:49.143 --> 12:52.188
exactly clarify anything.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.856
I-I was kind of hoping...

12:53.898 --> 12:55.816
You know, kid,

12:53.898 --> 12:55.816
there are a lot of people

12:55.858 --> 12:58.486
who would kill to have

12:55.858 --> 12:58.486
both "professional golfer"

12:58.528 --> 13:00.697
and "neurosurgeon"

12:58.528 --> 13:00.697
on their test results.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.532
Yeah, but that doesn't help me.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.200
I mean,

13:02.574 --> 13:04.200
how am I supposed to decide

13:04.242 --> 13:06.202
if I don't have

13:04.242 --> 13:06.202
any parameters at all?

13:06.244 --> 13:08.829
Well, boo-hoo for you,

13:06.244 --> 13:08.829
Mr. Unlimited Potential.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.832
Let me wipe my tears for you

13:08.871 --> 13:11.832
on my plastic briefcase.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.335
Does the test at least say

13:11.874 --> 13:14.335
what I might like?

13:14.377 --> 13:16.421
Aside from exposing

13:14.377 --> 13:16.421
middle-aged underachievers

13:16.463 --> 13:17.880
for the failures they are?

13:17.922 --> 13:19.006
Nope.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.550
Can I take the test again?

13:20.592 --> 13:22.093
Uh... no.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.470
Now, if you'll

13:22.135 --> 13:23.470
excuse me,

13:23.511 --> 13:24.845
I have to catch a bus

13:24.887 --> 13:27.223
or I'll be late

13:24.887 --> 13:27.223
for my night job...

13:27.265 --> 13:29.892
unless, of course,

13:27.265 --> 13:29.892
you'd like that, too.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.354
♪ ♪

13:48.411 --> 13:50.538
♪ ♪

14:23.863 --> 14:25.948
Dad, what are you doing up?

14:23.863 --> 14:25.948
It's, like, 5:30 in the morning.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.701
Ooh, wow. Really? 5:30?

14:27.742 --> 14:29.369
Yeah, I should be getting

14:27.742 --> 14:29.369
to bed. What are you doing up?

14:29.410 --> 14:30.911
I'm going to work.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.911
Maybe you remember it.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.622
Oh, hey, Francis,

14:30.953 --> 14:32.622
can I borrow 20 bucks?

14:32.664 --> 14:34.123
I need to buy

14:32.664 --> 14:34.123
some more paint.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.542
What? You just bought, like,

14:34.165 --> 14:35.542
six cans of paint yesterday.

14:35.583 --> 14:36.917
What happened to that?

14:36.959 --> 14:39.337
I used it. Man, what are you

14:36.959 --> 14:39.337
grilling me for?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.172
How can you use

14:39.379 --> 14:41.172
six cans of paint

14:39.379 --> 14:41.172
in one day?

14:41.214 --> 14:42.923
Francis, please,

14:41.214 --> 14:42.923
I really need it.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.175
I'm so close.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.093
It's almost right.

14:46.135 --> 14:49.597
Do you have any idea

14:46.135 --> 14:49.597
how hard I have to

14:46.135 --> 14:49.597
work to make $20?

14:49.639 --> 14:51.140
All right. All right!

14:51.182 --> 14:53.351
I didn't ask for a lecture.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.778
Hey, Dad, can

15:01.359 --> 15:03.778
we ask you for

15:01.359 --> 15:03.778
some advice?

15:03.820 --> 15:05.739
The girl who's

15:03.820 --> 15:05.739
been bugging Dewey

15:05.780 --> 15:07.407
still won't

15:05.780 --> 15:07.407
leave him alone.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.950
Now she's calling

15:07.448 --> 15:09.950
me Dewey Dwarf.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.537
I told him-- you've got

15:09.992 --> 15:12.537
to fight fire with fire

15:12.579 --> 15:15.206
and he should come up with some

15:12.579 --> 15:15.206
really raunchy nickname for her

15:15.248 --> 15:17.542
and spread it around school

15:15.248 --> 15:17.542
and church and stuff.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.460
You know,

15:17.584 --> 15:19.460
really get it out there.

15:19.502 --> 15:22.756
Uh, yeah, good

15:19.502 --> 15:22.756
for you, boys.

15:22.797 --> 15:23.964
So the name thing?

15:24.006 --> 15:25.174
You're on board

15:24.006 --> 15:25.174
with that?

15:30.638 --> 15:31.972
All right,

15:30.638 --> 15:31.972
let's get to work.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.600
What's that

15:32.014 --> 15:33.600
girl's name again?

15:33.641 --> 15:36.269
Regina Tucker.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.647
Don't worry.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.647
We'll think

15:36.310 --> 15:39.647
of something.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.944
Another day of crap.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.988
Damn catalogs.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.910
Idiot foreman.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.036
(bus pulls up)

15:59.333 --> 16:01.210
Watch your step.

16:01.252 --> 16:02.670
Whatever.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.971
So tired.

16:21.105 --> 16:24.066
(gasping and panting)

16:35.745 --> 16:39.833
(anguished cry)

16:39.874 --> 16:41.292
Hal, it's past midnight.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.877
Are you coming to bed?

16:42.919 --> 16:44.253
No! How can I go to bed?

16:44.295 --> 16:46.213
It's nothing

16:44.295 --> 16:46.213
what it should be.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.508
Honey, this

16:46.255 --> 16:48.508
is your dream.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.718
It's supposed to be fun.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.053
What are you talking about, fun?

16:53.095 --> 16:54.305
This isn't fun.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.140
This is driving me crazy!

16:56.182 --> 16:58.518
I just... I-I-I

16:56.182 --> 16:58.518
can't get it right.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.687
Well, you don't have

16:58.559 --> 17:00.687
to finish it.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.147
Look at you!

17:00.728 --> 17:03.147
You're killing yourself.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.732
One more day. That's all.

17:04.774 --> 17:06.108
I just need one more day!

17:06.150 --> 17:08.068
(paint cans clattering)

17:08.110 --> 17:11.489
Hal, there has got to be, like,

17:08.110 --> 17:11.489
500 gallons of paint up there.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.574
There isn't...

17:13.616 --> 17:16.243
Yeah, that's about right.

17:16.285 --> 17:19.873
Well... it's over.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.457
I just got the word.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.001
Downtown finished

17:21.499 --> 17:23.001
their inventory.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.293
We've lost.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.587
Chelooz marak!

17:26.629 --> 17:29.298
I think Garkech speaks

17:26.629 --> 17:29.298
for all of us.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.801
I'll be in the cookie aisle.

17:31.843 --> 17:33.093
Well, I say we

17:31.843 --> 17:33.093
just make up

17:33.135 --> 17:35.095
the rest of the

17:33.135 --> 17:35.095
numbers and go home.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.181
Wait a minute, go home?

17:37.223 --> 17:39.934
Weren't you listening? We lost.

17:39.976 --> 17:42.102
I just spent

17:39.976 --> 17:42.102
my entire spring break

17:42.144 --> 17:44.355
counting flip-flops and Vagisil.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.774
You're saying

17:44.397 --> 17:46.774
that was all for nothing?

17:46.816 --> 17:48.317
Yes.

17:48.359 --> 17:51.111
Do you know how many parties

17:48.359 --> 17:51.111
I missed this week?

17:51.153 --> 17:54.490
How many spring break

17:51.153 --> 17:54.490
debaucheries I could've been at?

17:54.532 --> 17:57.618
How many drunken sorority girls

17:54.532 --> 17:57.618
ripped their tops off

17:57.660 --> 18:00.120
without me there

17:57.660 --> 18:00.120
to yell encouragement?

18:00.162 --> 18:02.206
You can't tell me

18:00.162 --> 18:02.206
that was for nothing!

18:02.248 --> 18:05.125
We can't quit!

18:05.167 --> 18:08.504
Come on, guys.

18:05.167 --> 18:08.504
We took on a challenge.

18:08.546 --> 18:12.216
I'm staying until

18:08.546 --> 18:12.216
this is done the right way.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.093
Who's with me?

18:15.386 --> 18:17.137
Why aren't you translating?

18:17.179 --> 18:19.766
There's no point,

18:17.179 --> 18:19.766
but please go on.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.141
That's it.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.142
Ah.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.561
Okay, see you.

18:25.688 --> 18:28.148
All right, now,

18:25.688 --> 18:28.148
keep them closed.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.026
Come on.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.736
You've all been very patient.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.154
I appreciate that.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.032
You've been waiting

18:34.196 --> 18:36.032
a long time, so...

18:36.991 --> 18:38.117
Here it is.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.415
It's...

18:44.457 --> 18:47.752
Yeah.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.169
You're finished?

18:49.211 --> 18:50.838
Yeah. It's perfect!

18:50.880 --> 18:53.758
I mean, it's exactly

18:50.880 --> 18:53.758
how I imagined it.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.343
Then... look at it.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.470
What?

18:57.511 --> 18:58.763
Look at your painting.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.347
Oh, I can see it.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.600
Hal, I want you

19:00.389 --> 19:02.600
to look at that painting

19:02.642 --> 19:05.144
and tell me

19:02.642 --> 19:05.144
that you're satisfied with it.

19:09.899 --> 19:10.900
(yells in frustration)

19:10.942 --> 19:13.193
I knew it! You are not finished.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.403
I can't do it, Lois.

19:14.445 --> 19:15.655
It is driving me crazy.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.197
I have been

19:15.696 --> 19:17.197
slapping on paint

19:17.239 --> 19:19.117
day after day

19:17.239 --> 19:19.117
and I've got nothing!

19:19.158 --> 19:21.035
And I'm never going

19:19.158 --> 19:21.035
to get it right

19:21.077 --> 19:22.662
so I might as well

19:21.077 --> 19:22.662
just forget it.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.204
Oh, you listen to me, Hal.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.040
You are not going back to work

19:26.082 --> 19:27.875
until you get this

19:26.082 --> 19:27.875
out of your system.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.085
No!

19:29.127 --> 19:30.670
You don't

19:29.127 --> 19:30.670
understand.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.212
It is no use!

19:32.254 --> 19:33.714
You are not giving up.

19:33.756 --> 19:36.383
You are going to stay right here

19:33.756 --> 19:36.383
until you are finished.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.802
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

19:37.844 --> 19:39.846
I'm not going to go through this

19:37.844 --> 19:39.846
every five years

19:39.887 --> 19:41.263
when you decide

19:39.887 --> 19:41.263
that there's

19:39.887 --> 19:41.263
a sculpture

19:41.305 --> 19:42.723
or a fountain

19:41.305 --> 19:42.723
or God knows what

19:42.765 --> 19:44.224
it is you still

19:42.765 --> 19:44.224
have to build.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.225
You are going

19:44.266 --> 19:45.225
to finish it!

19:45.267 --> 19:46.644
Fine! You want them

19:46.686 --> 19:48.228
to see me finish it,

19:46.686 --> 19:48.228
I'll finish it.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.272
I'll put a little bit here, huh?

19:50.314 --> 19:52.025
How about there?

19:50.314 --> 19:52.025
How about there?!

19:52.066 --> 19:54.276
And...

19:54.318 --> 19:57.030
Oh... oh...

19:57.071 --> 20:00.116
And...

20:00.158 --> 20:01.534
here...

20:02.869 --> 20:04.871
And...

20:09.083 --> 20:11.502
Awesome!

20:11.544 --> 20:13.629
I don't believe it.

20:13.671 --> 20:17.675
That's it.

20:13.671 --> 20:17.675
That's what was in my head.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.343
FRANCIS:

20:17.717 --> 20:19.343
I've had it!

20:19.385 --> 20:23.263
Everyone at that place are

20:19.385 --> 20:23.263
a bunch of slacker, lazy...

20:23.305 --> 20:26.100
Oh, wow...

20:26.142 --> 20:27.518
Wow!

20:27.560 --> 20:33.273
Hal, I am so proud of you.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.902
I did it.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.987
I really did it.

20:38.029 --> 20:40.156
(ripping sound)

20:40.198 --> 20:41.824
What's that sound?

20:43.367 --> 20:44.284
I don't know.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.536
It sounds like...

20:48.915 --> 20:51.084
Look out! Paint-alanche!

20:51.125 --> 20:53.711
LOIS: Hal!

20:51.125 --> 20:53.711
(Hal yelling)

20:56.005 --> 20:59.592
(muffled):

20:56.005 --> 20:59.592
Mime mokay! Mime mokay!

21:01.343 --> 21:02.553
Oh, honey,

21:01.343 --> 21:02.553
I got to go. Bye.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.764
Francis, come on, I'll drive you

21:02.595 --> 21:04.764
to the bus station.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.306
Hey, vacation's over, mister.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.308
Time to get

21:06.348 --> 21:08.308
back to the old

21:06.348 --> 21:08.308
grindstone. Let's go.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.310
(Francis groaning)

21:10.352 --> 21:12.312
You know,

21:10.352 --> 21:12.312
all this made me realize,

21:12.354 --> 21:14.774
why plan for my future

21:12.354 --> 21:14.774
when it's just going to end up

21:14.815 --> 21:16.817
with a giant wall of paint

21:14.815 --> 21:16.817
crashing down on me?

21:16.859 --> 21:20.780
I'm just going to enjoy

21:16.859 --> 21:20.780
being a kid for a while.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.365
There's a lot

21:20.821 --> 21:23.365
of good things

21:20.821 --> 21:23.365
about being a kid.

21:23.407 --> 21:24.992
Ow!

21:25.034 --> 21:27.327
That's for stepping

21:25.034 --> 21:27.327
on my side of the room.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.329
No pressures,

21:27.369 --> 21:29.329
no responsibilities.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.706
Malcolm, how many times

21:30.748 --> 21:32.416
do I have to tell you

21:30.748 --> 21:32.416
to make up your bed?

21:32.458 --> 21:34.794
You are going to

21:32.458 --> 21:34.794
make up all of our

21:32.458 --> 21:34.794
beds for a month

21:34.835 --> 21:36.336
starting now.

21:36.378 --> 21:39.048
I think I'm smart enough to know

21:36.378 --> 21:39.048
when I got it good.
