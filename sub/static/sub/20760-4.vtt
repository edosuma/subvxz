WEBVTT

00:00.155 --> 00:01.573
Previously, on "12 Monkeys"...

00:01.576 --> 00:03.356
We honor time with patience.

00:03.358 --> 00:05.324
- Open up!
- That isn't someone

00:05.362 --> 00:08.973
who's ever been anywhere
she didn't wanna be.

00:09.008 --> 00:11.375
One chance. I can tell you
how to kill the Witness.

00:11.410 --> 00:14.879
Gentlemen, I'm splintering
you to the Emerson Hotel, 2007.

00:14.914 --> 00:16.647
You shouldn't go. All of this is wrong.

00:16.682 --> 00:19.049
Whatever you see is what
she wants you to see.

00:19.085 --> 00:21.485
You'll devise a plan, kill the Witness.

00:21.520 --> 00:23.153
You gave me a butterfly.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.823
The house, it was cedar
and pine, it was our home.

00:25.858 --> 00:28.525
James and Cassandra are
the origin of the Witness.

00:28.561 --> 00:30.160
Can you kill Cassandra Railly?

00:30.196 --> 00:31.528
Yeah.

00:46.746 --> 00:48.145
You can't outrun me, Cole.

00:48.180 --> 00:49.980
I am outrunning you, shitbag.

00:55.488 --> 00:57.588
You're growing faster
but running slower.

00:57.623 --> 01:01.458
Oh, that's funny, you little asshole.

01:03.663 --> 01:05.296
Hey, Ramse, check it out.

01:08.501 --> 01:11.235
What is that?

01:12.705 --> 01:14.204
A library?

01:15.574 --> 01:18.008
Do libraries have food?

01:21.434 --> 01:23.734
No, that place probably
cleared out a long time ago.

01:23.763 --> 01:24.729
Let's check it out.

01:24.760 --> 01:26.383
No, no.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.052
No, it's getting dark out.

01:28.087 --> 01:29.353
Let's head back.

01:29.356 --> 01:30.728
We'll scope the place out tomorrow

01:30.731 --> 01:32.356
and make sure no one's
around before we head inside.

01:32.358 --> 01:33.424
I'm starving.

01:33.459 --> 01:35.025
You can stay here if you want.

01:35.061 --> 01:36.193
I'm going to check it out.

01:36.228 --> 01:37.528
Cole!

01:50.476 --> 01:53.978
This whole thing could be a trap.

01:54.013 --> 01:55.813
I mean, all this time
we're after the Witness.

01:55.815 --> 01:57.681
It's like chasing a ghost.

01:57.717 --> 01:59.383
All of a sudden, Olivia shows up,

01:59.418 --> 02:03.120
tells us exactly when and where
to find them and kill them.

02:03.155 --> 02:04.755
It's too easy, right?

02:04.790 --> 02:08.491
Yeah, but she also said
that the Witness was gonna be

02:08.526 --> 02:10.894
surrounded by 100 of his followers.

02:10.930 --> 02:12.963
That's not easy, right?

02:15.034 --> 02:18.569
She was with the 12
Monkeys for her entire life.

02:18.612 --> 02:22.848
Shit, they're the whole
reason she even had a life.

02:22.875 --> 02:24.274
Why would she betray them?

02:24.310 --> 02:27.444
You know, the Witness
took everything from her.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.913
Everything.

02:29.949 --> 02:33.650
When you have nothing left...

02:37.123 --> 02:39.256
All that time you
spent with the Monkeys,

02:39.291 --> 02:42.259
with her...

02:42.294 --> 02:45.529
I mean, you'd know if this was a setup.

02:46.932 --> 02:49.099
She wants what we want.

03:15.661 --> 03:18.629
Miss Goines!

03:18.664 --> 03:20.297
Get out of there at once.

03:20.332 --> 03:22.566
The machine room is not a dormitory.

03:22.601 --> 03:26.303
You have quarters. Sleep there.

03:26.338 --> 03:29.302
You sleep there, 3PO.

03:47.764 --> 03:49.797
Snake... ends up eating his tail...

03:55.501 --> 03:58.035
Six or seven, six of them.

04:00.673 --> 04:02.005
What is it?

04:06.445 --> 04:09.179
Climb the steps.

04:09.215 --> 04:11.982
Ring the bell, and then...

04:24.330 --> 04:26.196
This is my chair.

04:26.232 --> 04:29.299
And this is not a zoo.

04:29.335 --> 04:32.469
- Okay.
- What is this?

04:32.505 --> 04:34.304
If I knew, maybe I'd be able to get

04:34.340 --> 04:36.673
a decent sleep around here.

04:36.709 --> 04:40.043
This is an evidence board,
not your portrait studio.

04:40.079 --> 04:42.379
I have a system here.

04:42.414 --> 04:44.181
Looks pretty random to me.

04:47.786 --> 04:50.053
Miss Goines...

04:53.292 --> 04:56.260
What is this image?

04:56.295 --> 04:59.229
A dying man.

05:01.767 --> 05:03.167
Who?

05:06.906 --> 05:08.705
I don't know.

05:32.932 --> 05:35.657
So the Witness is at a compound here.

05:35.699 --> 05:39.661
We come up from the south, take
out anybody position on side

05:39.664 --> 05:41.170
at the house.

05:41.173 --> 05:42.940
Sure, but it's gonna be well-protected.

05:42.975 --> 05:44.908
You and me and a couple of revolvers

05:44.944 --> 05:46.735
ain't gonna get it done, we're
gonna need real firepower.

05:46.737 --> 05:48.745
Yeah, I had an idea about that.

05:48.781 --> 05:50.214
You remember Otero?

05:50.249 --> 05:51.982
Deacon's guy?

05:52.017 --> 05:53.650
His dad was a gunrunner.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.118
He used to run the whole operation

05:55.154 --> 05:57.688
out the back of a bakery.

05:57.723 --> 06:00.557
Ha, let's get a taste, brother.

06:06.665 --> 06:08.565
That don't look like bread, cupcake.

06:08.601 --> 06:10.200
Who the hell are you?

06:10.236 --> 06:13.303
Health inspector, shithead.

06:14.673 --> 06:16.773
Surprise inspection.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.008
Drop your gun.

06:20.446 --> 06:22.045
- Health inspector?
- What?

06:22.081 --> 06:23.413
I just think you could
have done a little better.

06:23.415 --> 06:24.748
- That's all.
- Well, if your plan

06:24.783 --> 06:26.283
wasn't half-baked...

06:26.318 --> 06:29.253
Nice, got me when I yeast expected it.

06:29.288 --> 06:31.154
All right, buddy, you've got to stop.

06:31.190 --> 06:33.323
Hoo-hoo.

06:33.359 --> 06:35.626
Looks like you boys got
some guns in the oven.

06:35.661 --> 06:38.495
Oh, seriously, stop.

06:38.530 --> 06:40.597
Looks like for once
Otero wasn't exaggerating.

06:40.633 --> 06:42.199
Oh, you know Otero?

06:42.234 --> 06:43.367
His kid.

06:43.402 --> 06:44.801
- Danny?
- Yeah.

06:44.837 --> 06:46.970
He's four.

06:47.006 --> 06:49.506
Kids these days, huh?

06:49.541 --> 06:50.807
Look out!

06:54.513 --> 06:56.346
Well, that plan's gone a-rye.

06:56.382 --> 06:57.781
You win.

06:59.685 --> 07:02.413
Hey, I'm gonna circle
around the other way.

07:03.789 --> 07:06.356
We get separated, meet
you back at the Emerson.

07:06.392 --> 07:10.027
You got it.

07:11.163 --> 07:12.496
- Oh!
- Oh!

07:31.050 --> 07:32.549
Ramse?

07:47.566 --> 07:50.033
- Forget about me?
- Deacon...

07:50.069 --> 07:52.235
You ready to get the hell out of here?

07:52.271 --> 07:54.838
Oh. Ahh.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.876
You okay?

07:59.912 --> 08:01.158
Is Cole with you?

08:02.381 --> 08:05.048
Nope, just me.

08:05.084 --> 08:06.183
How are...

08:06.218 --> 08:07.818
That's a long story.

08:07.853 --> 08:10.387
Grab his knife.

08:12.624 --> 08:15.759
It's this way.

08:15.794 --> 08:17.427
How do you know that?

08:17.463 --> 08:20.030
The mysterious Mr. We
Honor Time With Patience...

08:20.065 --> 08:21.732
- Yeah, we've met.
- His bedside manner

08:21.767 --> 08:23.266
and culinary skills are for shit,

08:23.302 --> 08:24.848
but he gave me directions out of here.

08:24.851 --> 08:26.050
But we've got to move.

08:28.407 --> 08:29.977
We don't even know what year it is.

08:29.980 --> 08:31.441
It's 2047.

08:31.477 --> 08:33.376
When we left, it was 2045.

08:33.412 --> 08:36.046
Yep, but the ship is
about to leave this port

08:36.081 --> 08:39.448
to God knows when, and
we've got to get off now.

08:44.790 --> 08:47.324
She had help.

08:47.359 --> 08:49.559
How was this not foretold?

08:53.499 --> 08:55.565
Find them.

08:55.601 --> 08:58.034
They can't escape
before our next jump...

08:59.505 --> 09:02.506
Ready Titan. Time to go.

09:08.781 --> 09:11.715
Ramse?

09:15.120 --> 09:18.054
Ramse.

09:23.862 --> 09:25.862
Where the hell are you?

09:33.123 --> 09:34.756
Hospital dispatch.

09:34.759 --> 09:37.808
Hey, we're getting slammed
down here in the ER.

09:37.843 --> 09:40.777
Could you send down Dr.
Cassandra Railly, please?

09:40.813 --> 09:42.345
All right, I'll page her now.

09:42.381 --> 09:44.948
Thank you.

09:49.455 --> 09:51.981
Dr. Cassandra Railly to the ER.

09:52.004 --> 09:53.884
Dr. Railly to the ER.

10:28.774 --> 10:31.041
I thought you didn't want to see me.

10:32.510 --> 10:34.510
I don't.

10:34.579 --> 10:36.178
I got into your head.

10:36.247 --> 10:40.016
But you quite literally
got beneath my skin.

10:40.084 --> 10:41.550
Some might consider us even.

10:41.619 --> 10:43.552
We're about as even as...

10:43.621 --> 10:45.221
Prime number?

10:45.290 --> 10:47.316
Your brain has a rhythm to it.

10:47.319 --> 10:48.791
The same way that fractals have...

10:48.793 --> 10:49.825
Stop that.

10:49.894 --> 10:51.294
What?

10:51.362 --> 10:54.263
Please stop talking
like a super villain.

10:57.168 --> 10:59.502
My directness makes you uncomfortable.

10:59.570 --> 11:01.637
I stabbed you.

11:01.706 --> 11:03.472
I pushed you into a pool.

11:03.541 --> 11:06.509
And still you didn't break.

11:06.577 --> 11:07.877
Only my spine.

11:07.946 --> 11:09.378
But a couple of months in the dark,

11:09.380 --> 11:11.013
and you break wide open.

11:11.082 --> 11:12.648
You think I'm proud of that?

11:12.717 --> 11:15.318
No, I think you're unbreakable.

11:15.386 --> 11:17.486
That's what makes me uncomfortable.

11:17.555 --> 11:20.489
Because of you, my
friend is on a mission,

11:20.558 --> 11:23.225
and now I'm having these nightmares.

11:23.294 --> 11:26.829
Someone is gonna die, right?

11:26.898 --> 11:29.565
What makes you think
I have answers for you?

11:29.634 --> 11:31.934
Because you know everything.

11:33.671 --> 11:37.506
Yet here I am locked up.

11:39.444 --> 11:43.279
I was locked up once, not by choice.

11:43.331 --> 11:47.833
But you...

11:47.919 --> 11:49.919
I don't think you've
ever spent a day anywhere

11:49.988 --> 11:52.822
that wasn't exactly
where you wanted to be.

11:56.227 --> 11:58.427
Hey-ya, ladies.

12:00.031 --> 12:01.230
Do me a favor.

12:01.299 --> 12:04.500
Point those boom sticks
right at her temple.

12:04.569 --> 12:08.104
Itchy fingers right on the trigger.

12:14.445 --> 12:16.245
I ain't afraid of no ghost.

12:37.935 --> 12:40.069
I'm having trouble sleeping.

12:40.138 --> 12:41.771
And I want you to tell me a story

12:41.839 --> 12:44.673
that's gonna make the
nightmares go away.

12:52.399 --> 12:54.599
Dr. Cassandra Railly to the ER.

12:54.668 --> 12:55.834
Dr. Railly to the ER.

12:55.903 --> 12:58.116
What are they paging her for?

13:41.515 --> 13:43.181
Shit.

14:26.493 --> 14:28.160
Ahh!

14:33.066 --> 14:34.933
Shit.

14:37.538 --> 14:39.204
Shit.

14:39.273 --> 14:40.839
Ahh!

14:45.312 --> 14:48.677
Dr. Cassandra Railly to the ER.

15:00.394 --> 15:02.127
Where the hell were you?

15:05.199 --> 15:08.934
There was this other guy.

15:09.002 --> 15:11.069
I started chasing after him.

15:12.673 --> 15:15.407
We got into a scuffle.

15:15.475 --> 15:16.708
He gets loose.

15:16.784 --> 15:19.184
I got lost.

15:19.246 --> 15:22.814
You know, shit happens.

15:22.883 --> 15:24.950
That was hours ago.

15:28.255 --> 15:31.756
I got lost, okay?

15:31.825 --> 15:35.427
I saw Penn Station,
then I got on a train,

15:35.495 --> 15:37.762
and before I knew it,
I was going downtown.

15:40.534 --> 15:43.301
You went to see your mother?

15:43.370 --> 15:47.472
Are you out of your goddamned mind?

15:47.548 --> 15:51.884
Good old Roberta.

15:51.945 --> 15:53.678
What did she say?

15:57.317 --> 16:00.418
Nothing.

16:00.487 --> 16:01.887
Never saw her.

16:01.955 --> 16:05.423
I never went in.

16:05.492 --> 16:08.360
Just being close enough where I
could almost knock on the door,

16:08.435 --> 16:13.639
you know, almost see her face,

16:13.700 --> 16:17.335
that was good enough for me.

16:20.641 --> 16:23.775
Should be for you too, buddy.

16:23.844 --> 16:26.878
You know Cassie's somewhere
here in New York, right?

16:26.947 --> 16:30.148
You should take a couple
hours and go to see her.

16:30.217 --> 16:31.917
I'll go with you.

16:31.985 --> 16:34.152
I'm pretty sure Jones
would kill me if she knew

16:34.221 --> 16:35.620
I was even thinking about it.

16:37.691 --> 16:40.592
Anyway, Cassie doesn't even know me yet.

16:40.661 --> 16:42.928
I think you owe it to yourself.

16:42.996 --> 16:47.432
You might not get a second opportunity.

16:52.306 --> 16:54.973
No.

16:55.042 --> 16:57.642
No, I don't need to go
screwing up her life just yet.

16:57.711 --> 17:00.145
She's got enough on her
plate right now as it is.

17:00.213 --> 17:01.713
Like what?

17:01.782 --> 17:05.483
Winter of '07, there was an outbreak

17:05.551 --> 17:08.787
at some community
center in New Jersey...

17:08.855 --> 17:12.790
Parsippany Community Center.

17:12.858 --> 17:16.795
Anyway, she was there
for months, sounded awful.

17:16.863 --> 17:19.164
That's that, then.

17:21.367 --> 17:23.201
We don't go.

17:41.088 --> 17:43.388
I'm not staying here.

17:43.457 --> 17:45.991
That makes two of us.

17:46.059 --> 17:48.626
- Okay.
- All right.

18:03.443 --> 18:05.176
Ahh!

18:08.382 --> 18:10.648
Ahh!

18:15.522 --> 18:18.256
Augh! Ahh!

18:18.325 --> 18:20.692
Argh!

18:32.739 --> 18:35.640
Augh!

18:39.112 --> 18:40.311
Go.

18:45.381 --> 18:47.249
Find your son.

19:15.628 --> 19:18.228
You remember what you
were saying about...

19:18.297 --> 19:21.532
About that it might be a trap?

19:21.600 --> 19:24.735
Yeah. What changed your mind?

19:27.073 --> 19:29.073
I'm just thinking about her.

19:29.141 --> 19:31.308
I'm thinking about... About Olivia,

19:31.377 --> 19:36.647
that the... the smart play
is, we've got to plan for it.

19:36.716 --> 19:39.817
Look, right here there's a rest stop

19:39.885 --> 19:41.585
a mile out from the compound.

19:41.654 --> 19:44.188
You drop me off right here.

19:44.256 --> 19:47.091
And I go the rest of the way on foot.

19:47.159 --> 19:50.094
I'll suss it out, see if there's a trap.

19:50.162 --> 19:53.230
If there is, I'll fire off two shots.

19:53.299 --> 19:56.233
- You've got one.
- Just like old times.

20:09.882 --> 20:12.783
Cole.

20:21.127 --> 20:24.795
What do you got?

20:27.233 --> 20:29.366
What'd you come for? This is my spot.

20:37.309 --> 20:39.009
Run! Run!

20:47.987 --> 20:52.189
You sure you want to do this?

20:53.726 --> 20:56.593
Like this? Splitting up?

20:58.097 --> 20:59.863
It's the only way, brother.

21:01.667 --> 21:04.368
About time we set things straight.

21:08.340 --> 21:09.807
See you on the other side.

22:06.599 --> 22:09.700
I know this area.

22:09.768 --> 22:13.270
The facility's not that far.

22:13.339 --> 22:16.240
What the hell did they
want with us anyway?

22:16.308 --> 22:20.677
Why'd they keep us
locked up for so long?

22:20.746 --> 22:23.680
It doesn't matter now.

22:23.749 --> 22:26.750
What the hell happened to you in there?

22:26.819 --> 22:28.418
The Mother is gone.

22:28.487 --> 22:30.954
If we were able to undo her escape...

22:30.957 --> 22:33.202
I thought the suits only were
to be used for the protection

22:33.204 --> 22:34.424
of the Witness.

22:34.493 --> 22:38.128
If we alter Titan's timeline
to retrieve Cassandra Railly,

22:38.197 --> 22:39.863
it could have a serious impact.

22:41.166 --> 22:42.966
No, of course, you're right.

22:43.035 --> 22:45.602
And there will be
repercussions, naturally.

22:45.671 --> 22:48.171
There's already unrest
amongst some of the faithful.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.274
Aside from Olivia, I don't know of any.

22:50.342 --> 22:51.642
We destroyed her camp.

22:51.710 --> 22:54.778
It's doubtful she's still alive.

22:54.847 --> 22:57.614
My sister has certainly
caused enough damage.

22:57.683 --> 23:01.118
And if the faithful are
aware the Mother has gone...

23:01.186 --> 23:02.619
Don't tell them.

23:03.956 --> 23:07.057
Secrets are delicate and tenuous.

23:08.694 --> 23:10.994
The Witness' return is imminent.

23:11.063 --> 23:15.832
Let the faithful regale in that.

23:15.901 --> 23:20.604
I must execute everyone
involved in her imprisonment.

23:24.777 --> 23:27.678
I mean, besides yourself.

23:29.315 --> 23:30.637
Of course.

23:41.260 --> 23:45.495
This ought to be interesting,
showing up a year later.

23:45.564 --> 23:49.198
Two years for them.

23:50.936 --> 23:52.569
Oh, my God.

23:58.773 --> 24:00.484
It's been destroyed.

24:08.069 --> 24:13.078
I've seen a dying man, or woman.

24:13.113 --> 24:15.180
Is it Cole?

24:15.215 --> 24:17.048
Cassie?

24:17.084 --> 24:19.851
I'm not the one who can
see the future, Jennifer.

24:19.886 --> 24:21.386
You tell me.

24:21.421 --> 24:24.122
- This mission is a trap.
- Life is a trap.

24:24.157 --> 24:27.325
What we decide moment to
moment determines our survival.

24:27.361 --> 24:30.028
Huh. How's that working for you?

24:31.632 --> 24:33.632
I'd call it misfortune.

24:37.738 --> 24:39.204
You smell that?

24:39.239 --> 24:40.639
Oof!

24:40.674 --> 24:42.173
Ladies, you smell that?

24:42.209 --> 24:45.043
Ooh, hose this one down,

24:45.078 --> 24:47.545
'cause she's covered in bullshit.

24:47.581 --> 24:50.915
- Jennifer.
- Horse puckey.

24:50.951 --> 24:52.617
Hogwash.

24:52.653 --> 24:53.952
Gobshite.

24:53.987 --> 24:56.187
Hooey and poppycock.

24:56.223 --> 25:00.105
Oh, you've got plans inside plans.

25:00.141 --> 25:02.008
You've got lies to explain lies.

25:02.034 --> 25:05.206
Your... your spirit animal is Turducken.

25:07.668 --> 25:09.901
Not everyone gets to be Primary.

25:09.936 --> 25:12.337
The rest of us are doomed
to juggle eventualities.

25:12.372 --> 25:15.373
And when the music
stops and the balls drop,

25:15.409 --> 25:18.410
all you have left is
the one in your head.

25:18.445 --> 25:19.633
There is no script.

25:19.688 --> 25:20.887
There is no plan.

25:20.907 --> 25:23.415
- There is no...
- Map.

25:23.450 --> 25:25.583
Map. You had one.

25:25.619 --> 25:27.185
I saw it.

25:27.220 --> 25:30.322
A road map through time
complete with expiration dates.

25:31.758 --> 25:33.725
Oh, "Word of the Witness."

25:33.760 --> 25:35.126
His whole history.

25:35.162 --> 25:36.628
If you're really trying to help us,

25:36.663 --> 25:38.697
why didn't you tell Jones about it?

25:38.732 --> 25:40.863
Because it's a riddle,

25:40.899 --> 25:44.401
the code where the cypher
exists in one man's mind.

25:44.436 --> 25:47.070
No, no.

25:47.105 --> 25:48.538
You're holding back.

25:48.574 --> 25:51.274
You're scared.

25:51.310 --> 25:55.178
You're afraid if this
mission goes bad...

25:55.214 --> 25:58.281
the map is your bargaining chip,

25:58.317 --> 26:02.686
something else to offer...
oh, to save your life.

26:02.721 --> 26:05.255
Juggle, juggle, juggle.

26:05.290 --> 26:07.891
- I'm only human.
- Yeah, but you're not.

26:07.926 --> 26:09.226
That's a lie.

26:09.261 --> 26:11.228
If something happens to my friends,

26:11.263 --> 26:13.763
you're gonna need more
than a map to save you.

26:16.435 --> 26:18.235
And you're listening
to Central New Jersey's

26:18.270 --> 26:19.769
all-news station.

26:19.805 --> 26:21.371
It's time for Traffic on the Ones.

26:21.406 --> 26:24.274
An accident on 287 north of Parsippany

26:24.309 --> 26:26.510
has one northbound lane
closed all the way out past...

26:49.535 --> 26:51.535
Thought you were gonna
get some sleep, Dr. Railly.

26:51.537 --> 26:54.070
I thought so too,

26:54.106 --> 26:55.472
but they called me back in.

26:55.507 --> 26:57.908
You should try being a
little harder to find.

26:57.943 --> 26:59.476
I'm a first-year resident.

26:59.511 --> 27:02.946
I'm not allowed to be hard to find.

27:16.461 --> 27:18.461
She's not coming.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Toss it.

27:38.083 --> 27:39.883
No outbreak, huh?

27:39.918 --> 27:44.321
Oh, there's an outbreak.
It's just three states away.

27:44.356 --> 27:46.022
So when did you know?

27:46.058 --> 27:50.160
Oh, I knew the second
you showed up with Olivia.

27:50.195 --> 27:52.228
But I wanted to believe you.

27:55.033 --> 27:57.534
I always want to believe you.

27:57.569 --> 28:00.570
And you always let me down.

28:00.606 --> 28:02.138
I always let you down?

28:02.174 --> 28:06.843
I gave you chance after
chance to tell me the truth.

28:08.380 --> 28:11.147
And you never did.

28:11.183 --> 28:13.383
And then you asked me about Cassie.

28:14.720 --> 28:17.721
And I knew.

28:17.756 --> 28:18.956
So I gave you one last chance.

28:18.991 --> 28:20.757
I gave you this place.

28:22.594 --> 28:23.994
Hey, Ramse, check it out.

28:27.065 --> 28:30.400
I never noticed the sign that day.

28:30.435 --> 28:33.236
I was busy... saving your life!

28:34.740 --> 28:35.864
Run!

28:35.896 --> 28:38.875
You remember what you
said to me that day?

28:38.910 --> 28:41.211
That was the first time
you called me brother.

28:44.049 --> 28:45.248
You said we were family.

28:47.492 --> 28:49.213
I loved you for that.

28:54.726 --> 28:56.726
What about your other family?

28:59.831 --> 29:02.699
You and Cassie in 1957,

29:02.734 --> 29:05.969
the house of cedar and pine.

29:06.004 --> 29:08.505
How do you know about that?

29:08.540 --> 29:11.307
Olivia tell you that?

29:11.343 --> 29:13.043
She told me the truth.

29:13.078 --> 29:15.011
She told you the truth?

29:15.047 --> 29:16.613
This whole mission's a lie.

29:16.648 --> 29:21.017
I didn't come here to kill the Witness.

29:21.053 --> 29:23.987
I came here to make
sure he was never born.

29:27.125 --> 29:29.566
I came here to kill his mother.

29:37.803 --> 29:39.803
The Witness...

29:42.297 --> 29:44.219
is your son.

30:04.212 --> 30:08.815
There is no way anybody
could have survived this.

30:08.861 --> 30:10.961
Cole.

30:11.029 --> 30:13.597
We should have never left Titan.

30:13.665 --> 30:16.433
We should have found the Witness
and slit his goddamn throat

30:16.502 --> 30:18.535
when we had the chance.

30:18.604 --> 30:20.904
- We don't know that...
- That they lost?

30:22.374 --> 30:24.274
Are you sure about that?

30:26.311 --> 30:27.861
Welcome home.

30:29.815 --> 30:31.715
This can't be how it ends.

30:34.787 --> 30:36.887
What are you doing?

30:38.957 --> 30:41.491
There is nothing down
there that you want to see.

30:41.560 --> 30:44.461
There has to be. Something. A way home.

30:49.868 --> 30:52.002
I know that wall.

30:53.605 --> 30:55.372
And that wasn't there before.

31:03.182 --> 31:04.948
Butterfly.

31:17.262 --> 31:18.628
That's bullshit. That's crazy.

31:18.697 --> 31:20.664
Is it? Think about it.

31:25.971 --> 31:28.371
What?

31:28.440 --> 31:31.341
We were together, but I... I undid it.

31:31.410 --> 31:32.409
It never happened.

31:32.477 --> 31:35.078
Your Army of the 12 Monkeys,

31:35.147 --> 31:37.047
Titan, the virus,

31:37.115 --> 31:40.550
the Witness, Sam.

31:40.626 --> 31:44.094
It starts with you,
brother, you and her.

31:44.156 --> 31:45.188
- What?
- Why do you think

31:45.257 --> 31:46.756
you're still alive

31:46.825 --> 31:48.892
all those times they
could have taken you out?

31:48.961 --> 31:50.227
No, no.

31:50.295 --> 31:52.562
They were protecting you and Cassie.

31:52.631 --> 31:55.565
They wanted that baby born.

31:55.634 --> 31:59.636
That's why they took her to Titan.

32:01.940 --> 32:04.207
It's got to make sense now, brother.

32:07.246 --> 32:10.580
Why didn't you tell me?

32:10.649 --> 32:13.316
I was trying to protect you.

32:13.385 --> 32:17.587
I didn't think you could handle it.

32:17.656 --> 32:18.755
Let me kill her.

32:18.824 --> 32:20.490
Stop it.

32:20.559 --> 32:22.092
You'll never know.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.227
I kill her, everything will reset.

32:24.296 --> 32:25.362
No.

32:25.430 --> 32:28.832
One life for 7 billion...

32:28.901 --> 32:30.758
You don't get to say that to me!

32:46.485 --> 32:48.919
Ramse.

32:53.792 --> 32:56.059
Stop!

34:35.527 --> 34:37.159
Stop.

34:40.532 --> 34:44.167
Stop.

34:44.235 --> 34:47.303
Stop!

34:47.371 --> 34:48.705
Ramse, stop!

35:13.198 --> 35:15.732
God damn it. Why couldn't
you just trust me?

35:18.136 --> 35:20.670
I always trusted you.

35:27.746 --> 35:30.480
Oh, Jesus Christ.

35:31.783 --> 35:35.218
We always...

35:35.287 --> 35:37.153
try to do the right thing.

35:41.019 --> 35:44.043
We just end up doing it

35:44.068 --> 35:47.464
the wrong way, right?

35:47.532 --> 35:48.740
Yeah.

35:51.369 --> 35:53.103
I'm gonna fix this.

35:53.171 --> 35:54.637
Don't...

35:54.706 --> 35:56.438
don't undo this.

35:58.882 --> 36:00.477
Promise me...

36:10.922 --> 36:13.064
Don't undo this.

36:19.464 --> 36:22.065
You're on your own, brother.

36:30.775 --> 36:32.675
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

36:32.744 --> 36:34.677
Hey.

36:34.746 --> 36:36.509
I'll see you soon.

36:43.288 --> 36:44.384
Brother.

36:55.700 --> 36:57.125
Hey.

37:30.435 --> 37:33.336
Ahh!

37:38.076 --> 37:42.512
Augh.

38:00.234 --> 38:03.773
I know I'm not supposed to be here.

38:05.466 --> 38:07.032
You're hurt.

38:07.067 --> 38:08.467
Let's get you inside.

38:11.138 --> 38:14.422
I don't think I can do this alone.

38:19.680 --> 38:22.014
I need you to come home, Cassie.

38:25.185 --> 38:27.786
Please.

38:27.821 --> 38:30.872
Okay, I'm gonna find
someone to help you.

38:32.860 --> 38:35.327
Wait right here.

38:47.289 --> 38:49.473
How do you know that
this was meant for you?

38:49.476 --> 38:51.043
I know.

38:53.914 --> 38:55.981
You... you okay?

38:58.118 --> 39:00.252
Keep digging.

39:04.725 --> 39:07.592
What is it?

39:11.665 --> 39:13.632
Our way home.

39:30.417 --> 39:31.749
Are you hurt?

39:35.289 --> 39:36.760
What happened?

39:41.061 --> 39:42.861
Mr. Cole, where's Mr. Ramse?

39:42.896 --> 39:47.599
He didn't make it.

39:50.671 --> 39:52.204
Cole, you're alive.

39:52.239 --> 39:55.073
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

39:55.109 --> 39:57.909
Okay, wait, as much as I would
love you to blast their brains

39:57.945 --> 39:59.945
all over the walls, she knows something.

39:59.980 --> 40:01.546
There's something real.

40:01.582 --> 40:03.415
Cole, Cole, Cole...
There's a map, and it's

40:03.450 --> 40:05.083
about the red forest and everything.

40:05.119 --> 40:06.618
We can use it. No.

40:06.653 --> 40:08.653
He told you.

40:10.290 --> 40:12.424
And you chose her.

40:15.129 --> 40:16.661
You're gonna need me.

40:16.697 --> 40:18.130
For what?

40:18.165 --> 40:20.665
To find your son.

40:24.405 --> 40:26.938
Your secret's safe with me.

41:40.314 --> 41:42.080
I'm home.
