WEBVTT

00:07.508 --> 00:10.181
ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL MISSION!

00:11.282 --> 00:13.114
SURE YOU GUYS BLEW
A LOT OF STUFF UP,

00:13.114 --> 00:15.686
BUT HEY,
THAT'S THE CITY'S PROBLEM NOW.

00:15.686 --> 00:18.619
UH, I AM SO EXHAUSTED.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.492
I CAN'T WAIT TO JUST STAND UP,
AND GO TO SLEEP.

00:21.492 --> 00:23.354
WELL,
YOU GUYS GET YOUR REST.

00:23.354 --> 00:25.396
MY BIG NASA
PRESENTATION IS THIS WEEK,

00:25.396 --> 00:26.657
AND WE STILL
HAVE TO COMPLETE TRAINING

00:26.657 --> 00:28.229
ON MY GRAVITY
PROPULSION BELT.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.030
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS,

00:30.030 --> 00:32.633
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE
IT DOES A LOT MORE
THAN HOLD UP MY PANTS.

00:34.205 --> 00:36.167
THIS IS A HUGE CONTRACT.

00:36.167 --> 00:37.408
IF NASA BUYS THIS,

00:37.408 --> 00:39.540
ASTRONAUTS WILL
BE ABLE TO SPACEWALK

00:39.540 --> 00:41.172
ANYWHERE IN THE GALAXY.

00:41.172 --> 00:43.544
THEY'LL PROBABLY NAME
A MOON AFTER ME, OR A PLANET!

00:43.544 --> 00:45.216
THINGS ARE GOING TO LAND ON ME!

00:45.216 --> 00:46.777
HA HA!

00:46.777 --> 00:48.719
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS
BRIGHT AND EARLY IN THE MORNING.

00:48.719 --> 00:50.221
WAIT, TOMORROW?

00:50.221 --> 00:52.383
NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

00:52.383 --> 00:54.285
I PLANNED AN AWESOME
CYBERPONG TOURNAMENT.

00:54.285 --> 00:56.287
I MADE NICKNAMES AND EVERYTHING.

00:56.287 --> 00:57.528
I'M "KINGPONG".

00:59.590 --> 01:03.294
AND TOMORROW'S
THE TEEN FIANCEE MARATHON ON TV.

01:03.294 --> 01:04.465
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE,

01:04.465 --> 01:06.837
BUT I ACTUALLY
FOUND A GROUP OF PEOPLE

01:06.837 --> 01:08.839
WHO'S LIVES ARE
MORE PATHETIC THAN MINE.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.842
YEAH, AND I WAS
GOING TO HAVE A SPA DAY.

01:11.842 --> 01:14.175
ACCORDING TO ONE
OF BREE'S GIRLY MAGAZINE'S...

01:14.175 --> 01:16.307
I HAVE CANKLES.

01:17.848 --> 01:20.411
AND I WAS GOING TO GET
A HEADSTART ON MY HOMEWORK.

01:22.513 --> 01:25.556
I MEAN,
PLAY SPORTS AND TALK TO GIRLS.

01:26.657 --> 01:29.820
ALL RIGHT.
LOOK, NONE OF THAT IS HAPPENING.

01:29.820 --> 01:31.422
THIS STUFF IS IMPORTANT.

01:31.422 --> 01:33.594
WHAT MAKES YOUR STUFF
MORE IMPORTANT THAN OURS?

01:33.594 --> 01:38.429
UH, 'CAUSE MY STUFF CAN
MAKE A BILLION DOLLARS.

01:38.429 --> 01:40.631
YEAH, SO, WHEN
YOU'RE THE BOSS,

01:40.631 --> 01:42.303
YOU CAN MAKE THE RULES.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.504
BUT UNTIL THEN,

01:43.504 --> 01:46.106
( deep voice )
I AM THE KING OF DAVENPORTIA,

01:46.106 --> 01:48.279
AND YOU WILL ALL DO MY BIDDING.

01:48.279 --> 01:49.280
HA HA HA HA--

01:49.280 --> 01:50.681
OH! OW!

01:53.414 --> 01:55.186
MAN, THIS STINKS.

01:55.186 --> 01:57.818
WHY DO WE ALWAYS HAVE
TO DO WHAT HE WANTS US TO DO?

01:57.818 --> 02:00.521
WEREN'T YOU LISTENING?
THE MAN IS KING!

02:00.521 --> 02:02.723
HEY!

02:02.723 --> 02:05.526
MAYBE YOU GUYS SHOULD
DO WHAT THOSE HOTEL
WORKERS DOWNTOWN DID.

02:05.526 --> 02:06.727
YOU KNOW, STRIKE.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.559
OKAY.

02:08.559 --> 02:10.531
OW! WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

02:10.531 --> 02:11.602
LEO SAID STRIKE.

02:11.602 --> 02:12.733
STRIKE?

02:12.733 --> 02:14.165
OW!

02:14.165 --> 02:15.566
WHAT'S A STRIKE?

02:15.566 --> 02:16.567
STOP IT!

02:18.569 --> 02:20.611
IT'S WHEN EMPLOYEES
REFUSE TO WORK,

02:20.611 --> 02:22.443
UNTIL THEY GET BETTER
WORKING CONDITIONS,

02:22.443 --> 02:23.574
LIKE MORE DAYS OFF.

02:23.574 --> 02:25.716
OR IN YOUR CASE...

02:25.716 --> 02:27.147
A DAY OFF.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.820
HEY, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

02:29.820 --> 02:31.522
I SAY WE ALL STRIKE!

02:31.522 --> 02:32.753
OH, COME ON!

02:32.753 --> 02:35.786
THE WORLD'S
FIRST BIONIC SUPERHUMANS.

02:35.786 --> 02:36.887
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US.

02:36.887 --> 02:38.689
FASTER.

02:38.689 --> 02:39.760
SMARTER.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.663
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS--

02:42.663 --> 02:44.665
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

03:22.373 --> 03:24.975
♪ FIDDILY-DIDDILY-DIDDILY-DI ♪

03:24.975 --> 03:27.238
♪ FIDDILY-DIDDILY ♪

03:27.238 --> 03:29.240
( king voice )
GREETINGS PEOPLE OF DAVENPORTIA.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.812
IT IS I, KING DONALD,
HERE TO TRAIN THEE.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.414
HA HA!

03:33.414 --> 03:34.515
All: UNFAIR.

03:34.515 --> 03:35.546
ON STRIKE.

03:35.546 --> 03:36.587
UNFAIR.

03:36.587 --> 03:37.518
ON STRIKE.

03:37.518 --> 03:38.649
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

03:38.649 --> 03:40.891
WE... ARE ON STRIKE.

03:40.891 --> 03:42.993
WHY WOULD YOU GUYS STRIKE?

03:42.993 --> 03:45.596
YOU HAVE THE MOST AWESOME
LIVES EVER.

03:45.596 --> 03:46.757
EXCEPT MAYBE FOR MINE.

03:46.757 --> 03:49.530
HA... HA... HA.

03:49.530 --> 03:50.801
WE'RE SERIOUS.

03:50.801 --> 03:52.733
ADAM EVEN MADE US SIGNS.

03:56.607 --> 03:59.310
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE
USED A PENCIL.

03:59.310 --> 04:02.242
OH, OKAY GUYS.
QUIT BEING RIDICULOUS.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.614
THERE'S NOTHING
RIDICULOUS ABOUT IT.

04:03.614 --> 04:05.516
THEY'RE ON STRIKE,
AND I'M THEIR CAPTAIN.

04:05.516 --> 04:06.847
WE'RE STICKING IT TO THE MAN.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.380
YEAH!
AND IT DON'T EXACTLY
KNOW WHAT IT IS,

04:09.380 --> 04:10.681
BUT WE'RE STICKING
IT TO YA!

04:11.852 --> 04:15.726
AND IT'S GOING TO BE
REALLY HARD TO GET OFF.

04:15.726 --> 04:18.389
LEO, WHY ARE
YOU STRIKING?

04:18.389 --> 04:19.660
YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO TRAIN.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.531
THIS ISN'T ABOUT TRAINING.

04:21.531 --> 04:22.863
IT'S ABOUT UNITY!

04:22.863 --> 04:23.964
AND EQUALITY!

04:23.964 --> 04:25.736
AND GETTING WHAT WE WANT!

04:25.736 --> 04:27.638
ITY...

04:28.669 --> 04:30.471
WE'RE STRIKING FOR A DAY OFF.

04:30.471 --> 04:33.374
WE NEED DOWNTIME
JUST TO HAVE FUN.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.576
AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T
EFFECT OUR SCHOOL WORK.

04:38.449 --> 04:40.711
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE ARE UNITED IN THIS CAUSE.

04:40.711 --> 04:42.713
WE WILL GET WHAT WE DESERVE,
BECAUSE...

04:42.713 --> 04:44.585
SUPERHUMANS ARE HUMANS TOO!

04:44.585 --> 04:45.616
COME ON, GUYS.

04:45.616 --> 04:47.458
All:
SUPERHUMANS ARE HUMANS TOO!

04:47.458 --> 04:49.720
SUPERHUMANS ARE HUMANS TOO!

04:49.720 --> 04:51.662
SUPERHUMANS
ARE HUMANS TOO!

04:51.662 --> 04:54.565
SUPERHUMANS ARE HUMANS TOO!

04:54.565 --> 04:57.628
I SEE.
YOU GUYS WANT TO PLAY HARDBALL.

04:57.628 --> 04:59.330
YES, WE DO.

04:59.330 --> 05:01.532
AND AFTER THAT, WE'RE GOING
TO GO RIGHT BACK TO STRIKING.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.538
THE KIDS SAY I DON'T GIVE
THEM ENOUGH TIME OFF.

05:07.538 --> 05:08.739
HOT STOVE!

05:10.481 --> 05:12.082
BUT I HAVE BEEN MORE THAN FAIR.

05:12.082 --> 05:13.313
I FEED THEM.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.585
I CLOTHE THEM.

05:14.585 --> 05:18.649
AND I GIVE THEM A VERY
GENEROUS 10% DISCOUNT

05:18.649 --> 05:21.051
AT THE DAVENPORT
INDUSTRIES GIFT SHOP.

05:21.051 --> 05:25.556
DONALD, IF A CALENDAR
WITH 12 PICTURES OF YOU
ENJOYING THE GREAT OUTDOORS

05:25.556 --> 05:26.497
DOESN'T MAKE THEM HAPPY...

05:26.497 --> 05:28.399
WHAT WILL?

05:28.399 --> 05:29.960
YOU KNOW WHAT MY
FAVORITE ONE WAS?

05:29.960 --> 05:32.463
DON-UARY.

05:32.463 --> 05:34.935
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
THOSE KIDS AREN'T YOU.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.007
WORK DOESN'T ALWAYS COME FIRST.
THEY'RE TEENAGERS.

05:37.007 --> 05:38.969
UH, EXCUSE ME.

05:38.969 --> 05:42.072
THEY WERE THE ONES WHO
WANTED TO GO TO SCHOOL
 AND GO ON MISSIONS.

05:42.072 --> 05:43.544
THEY NEED KID TIME.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.416
YOU KNOW HOW HARD THEY TRAIN.

05:45.416 --> 05:47.978
BEND A LITTLE.
IT IS NOT ALWAYS ABOUT YOU.

05:47.978 --> 05:53.854
OKAY. THIS CONVERSATION
JUST TOOK A SHARP LEFT
TURN INTO CRAZY TOWN.

05:56.427 --> 05:57.588
BAM!
 POW!

05:57.588 --> 05:58.589
TAKE THAT!
 NEVER!

05:58.589 --> 06:00.491
EAT IT!
 NOT GOING TO HIT ME!

06:00.491 --> 06:02.633
WINNING SHOT!
 REJECTED!

06:03.464 --> 06:04.965
BOOM!

06:07.998 --> 06:09.870
CAN YOU GUYS
PLEASE KEEP IT DOWN!

06:09.870 --> 06:11.572
TEEN FIANCEE IS ON.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.945
JIMMY-JOHN IS ABOUT TO POP
THE QUESTION AT THE TACO SHACK.

06:14.945 --> 06:17.648
HE HID HER RING IN A CHURRO!
( squeals )

06:17.648 --> 06:18.779
WHAT?

06:18.779 --> 06:21.952
WHO WANTS BURRITOS?!

06:25.486 --> 06:28.058
AH! FRESH OUT OF THE EYEBALL.

06:30.661 --> 06:32.593
( bubbling )

06:32.593 --> 06:34.965
AHH! THAT'S THE STUFF.

06:36.527 --> 06:37.468
All: HEY!

06:37.468 --> 06:38.469
WHAT GIVES?

06:38.469 --> 06:40.701
MY CANKLES!

06:40.701 --> 06:44.835
AND DARKNESS FALLS
ACROSS THE LAND OF DAVENPORTIA.

06:44.835 --> 06:47.137
HA HA HA HA!

06:47.137 --> 06:49.440
TURN OUR STUFF BACK ON!

06:49.440 --> 06:52.613
I THINK YOU MEAN,
TURN MY STUFF BACK ON.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.415
BECAUSE YOU
CAN'T STRIKE AGAINST ME

06:55.415 --> 06:57.718
WITHOUT STRIKING AGAINST
DAVENPORT INDUSTRIES,

06:57.718 --> 07:01.722
AND THAT MEANS YOU CAN'T USE
DAVENPORT INDUSTRIES' EQUIPMENT.

07:01.722 --> 07:04.495
HA! BOOM!

07:04.495 --> 07:05.596
MMM!

07:06.997 --> 07:09.129
SO, IF YOU DON'T MIND,

07:09.129 --> 07:13.504
I WILL TAKE THAT, AND THAT,
AND THAT, AND THIS, AND THAT.

07:13.504 --> 07:14.705
NO!

07:14.705 --> 07:15.866
HA HA!

07:15.866 --> 07:17.608
AND... THAT!

07:17.608 --> 07:19.139
OH, HEY! THAT'S
MY FACE CREAM!

07:19.139 --> 07:21.642
ADAM, THIS IS SOUR CREAM.

07:21.642 --> 07:24.515
YEAH, AND WHEN IT'S
DONE ON MY FACE,

07:24.515 --> 07:25.946
I USE IT ON MY BURRITO.

07:27.618 --> 07:29.550
AND THAT IS ALSO MINE.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.450
HEY!

07:32.583 --> 07:34.785
YEP! NOW, ALL YOU
HAVE TO DO IS END THE STRIKE,

07:34.785 --> 07:36.487
AND YOU CAN HAVE THE STUFF BACK.

07:36.487 --> 07:37.828
HMM. SOUNDS LIKE
A WIN-WIN.

07:37.828 --> 07:39.089
I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR IT.

07:39.089 --> 07:40.230
NO!

07:40.230 --> 07:41.792
WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAY OFF?

07:41.792 --> 07:43.564
COME ON, GUYS! STAY DEFIANT!

07:43.564 --> 07:44.595
STAND UP TO THE MAN!

07:44.595 --> 07:46.497
BUT THE MAN HAS MY BURRITO!

07:46.497 --> 07:49.469
AND THE MAN
IS HAVING IT FOR LUNCH.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.074
NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND...

07:54.074 --> 07:55.706
I'LL BE UP
IN MY WELL-LIT MANSION,

07:55.706 --> 07:58.108
PLAYING WITH
ALL MY TOYS THAT STILL WORK.

07:58.108 --> 07:59.550
HA HA HA HA!

08:02.112 --> 08:04.054
HA HA HA HA!
HEE HEE HEE HEE!

08:04.054 --> 08:05.916
LAST NIGHT
I TURNED THE AIR-CONDITIONING

08:05.916 --> 08:07.558
IN THE LAB
DOWN TO MEAT LOCKER!

08:07.558 --> 08:10.791
THEY ARE GOING
TO HAVE TO GIVE UP, OR GROW FUR!

08:10.791 --> 08:14.665
YOU REALIZE YOU'RE
FIGHTING WITH CHILDREN?

08:14.665 --> 08:17.227
YES! AND I'M WINNING!

08:17.227 --> 08:18.969
HA HA HA!

08:18.969 --> 08:21.031
OH! BY THE WAY, NASA CALLED.

08:21.031 --> 08:22.733
OH, AND THEY WANT
THEIR NERD BACK.

08:22.733 --> 08:24.675
IT'S FUNNY EVERY TIME.

08:24.675 --> 08:27.037
NO, SERIOUSLY.
THEY LEFT A MESSAGE.

08:27.037 --> 08:28.508
THEY MOVED UP
YOUR BIG PRESENTATION,

08:28.508 --> 08:30.140
AND THE REP IS COMING
HERE TOMORROW.

08:30.140 --> 08:31.542
TOMORROW?

08:31.542 --> 08:32.943
BUT THE-BUT THE GRAVITY
BELT ISN'T EVEN READY YET.

08:32.943 --> 08:34.645
I HAVE TO
CALIBRATE THE JETS,

08:34.645 --> 08:36.246
AND THEN-AND THEN
I HAVE TO TEST IT,

08:36.246 --> 08:37.517
AND-AND WHAT
AM I GOING TO DO?

08:37.517 --> 08:39.549
I DON'T KNOW.
I STOPPED LISTENING AT "BELT".

08:43.624 --> 08:44.795
UHH!

08:44.795 --> 08:45.956
SO... COLD.

08:45.956 --> 08:47.828
IT'S FREEZING
DOWN HERE.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.860
I... CAN'T...
FEEL MY TOES.

08:49.860 --> 08:53.734
BECAUSE THOSE
ARE MINE, WEIRDO!

08:57.067 --> 08:58.739
GUYS! NASA CALLED.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.541
THEY WANT THEIR
NERD BACK?

09:01.541 --> 09:02.773
LOOK, THEY MOVED

09:02.773 --> 09:05.015
THE GRAVITY BELT PRESENTATION
UP TO TOMORROW!

09:05.015 --> 09:07.578
SO, WE HAVE TO PUT ALL
THIS RIDICULOUSNESS BEHIND US,

09:07.578 --> 09:08.679
AND GET BACK TO WORK!

09:08.679 --> 09:09.750
STRIKE'S OVER!

09:09.750 --> 09:11.852
AU CONTRAIRE, BIG D.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.655
YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW
HOW A STRIKE WORKS.

09:14.655 --> 09:17.187
IT'S NOT OVER BECAUSE
 YOU SAY IT'S OVER.

09:17.187 --> 09:20.661
GUYS, THE BIGGEST CONTRACT
OF MY LIFE IS ON THE LINE HERE.

09:20.661 --> 09:24.094
OH! WE'D LOVE TO HELP YOU,
MR. DAVENPORT,

09:24.094 --> 09:27.337
BUT SINCE YOU
 DIDN'T CARE ABOUT OUR NEEDS,

09:27.337 --> 09:29.640
WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT YOURS?

09:29.640 --> 09:34.274
UH, BECAUSE I,
AND LISTEN CLOSELY NOW...

09:34.274 --> 09:36.647
( screaming )
SAID SO!

09:36.647 --> 09:37.978
ALL RIGHT. SO, I'M GOING
TO GO GET THE GRAVITY BELT,

09:37.978 --> 09:40.751
AND WHEN I COME BACK,
STRIKE'S OVER!

09:42.613 --> 09:43.884
DID WE WIN?

09:46.086 --> 09:48.288
GREAT PLAN, LEO.
WE LOST.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.020
NO, THAT'S WHAT HE
WANTS YOU TO THINK.

09:50.020 --> 09:51.892
BUT NOW WE HAVE ALL
THE LEVERAGE.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.593
YOU'RE RIGHT!

09:53.593 --> 09:55.365
HE CAN'T DO THAT
PRESENTATION WITHOUT US.

09:55.365 --> 09:56.867
MM-HMM.

09:56.867 --> 09:59.169
AND WE CAN USE THAT TO GET
WHAT YOU GUYS WANT, AND MORE!

09:59.169 --> 10:01.371
TRUST ME, GUYS.
I SMELL A VICTORY.

10:01.371 --> 10:03.734
OH! NO, THOSE ARE MY FEET.

10:03.734 --> 10:05.876
I USED ROSEWATER
IN MY CANKLE BATH.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.841
OH, GRAVITY BELT.

10:10.841 --> 10:12.312
HOW I LOVE YOU.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.687
YOU TWO NEED A MINUTE?

10:16.687 --> 10:20.390
I WASN'T TALKING TO IT.

10:20.390 --> 10:23.353
I'M HERE TO NEGOTIATE.

10:23.353 --> 10:25.896
LEO, THERE IS
NOTHING TO NEGOTIATE.

10:25.896 --> 10:27.197
THE STRIKE'S OVER.

10:27.197 --> 10:29.029
AH, SLOW YOUR ROLL,
BIG MONEY.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.963
YOU NEED THEM FOR
YOUR DEMONSTRATION,

10:32.963 --> 10:35.335
SO WE HAVE SOME
NEW DEMANDS.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.007
GET UP.
 RIGHT, SORRY.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.741
FIRST, BETTER SNACKS.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.312
SECOND, A 401K.

10:42.312 --> 10:45.015
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,
BUT WE KNOW WE WANT IT.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.648
THIRD, MATCHING HATS.

10:48.648 --> 10:53.724
LEO, THOSE ARE SOME
INTERESTING DEMANDS.

10:53.724 --> 10:57.387
WELL, I'D BE LYING IF I SAID
I DIDN'T HAVE SOME INPUT.

10:57.387 --> 11:02.432
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
SO HARD ON WHAT THEY WANT.

11:02.432 --> 11:07.067
WHY DON'T WE TALK
ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT?

11:07.067 --> 11:09.399
WELL, THIS ISN'T
ABOUT WHAT I WANT.

11:09.399 --> 11:12.142
BUT I'M LISTENING.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.375
LEO SHOULD HAVE
BEEN BACK BY NOW.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.108
HIS LUNGS ARE WAY TOO TINY
TO BE TALKING THIS LONG.

11:18.108 --> 11:20.080
THE NEGOTIATIONS
MUST BE GRUELING.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.351
UHH!

11:21.351 --> 11:23.754
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE DEMANDED
THAT BUCKET OF SOUR CREAM!

11:25.185 --> 11:28.859
YES, I'M SURE THAT'S
THE STICKING POINT.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.222
OH, FINALLY.

11:32.222 --> 11:34.294
IS THE MAN WITH
THE FANCY BELT READY TO BUCKLE?

11:34.294 --> 11:36.827
NOPE. ACTUALLY, I'M
READY TO BEGIN TRAINING

11:36.827 --> 11:38.328
FOR THE PRESENTATION.

11:38.328 --> 11:40.400
YOU CAN'T DO THAT
WITHOUT ONE OF US.

11:40.400 --> 11:45.836
ACTUALLY, I CAN,
BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN REPLACED.

11:47.377 --> 11:49.039
BOOM!
 BOOM.

11:51.081 --> 11:53.844
OKAY, YOU'RE REPLACING US?

11:53.844 --> 11:56.216
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO NEGOTIATE FOR US!

11:56.216 --> 11:58.048
TO BE FAIR,
YOUR DEMANDS WERE...

11:58.048 --> 12:00.090
RIDICULOUS.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.123
THEY WERE YOUR DEMANDS!

12:03.123 --> 12:04.995
WHEN DID THEY BECOME RIDICULOUS?

12:04.995 --> 12:07.197
WHEN I GOT WHAT
I WANTED. BOOM!

12:20.070 --> 12:22.072
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!

12:22.072 --> 12:24.244
WE HAD DAVENPORT RIGHT
WHERE WE WANTED HIM,

12:24.244 --> 12:26.116
AND LEO JUST HANDED
HIM ALL THE POWER.

12:26.116 --> 12:27.447
I KNOW.
WHAT WAS HE THINKING?

12:27.447 --> 12:29.479
NOW WE'RE NEVER
GOING TO GET MATCHING HATS!

12:31.822 --> 12:33.523
IF LEO SUCCEEDS AS A TEST PILOT,

12:33.523 --> 12:36.356
DAVENPORT GETS WHAT HE WANTS,
AND WE LOSE.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.158
I NEED MY TV!

12:38.158 --> 12:39.960
I AM A HIGHLY
IRRATIONAL TEENAGE GIRL,

12:39.960 --> 12:41.761
AND IT IS
THE ONLY THING KEEPING ME

12:41.761 --> 12:43.463
FROM UNLEASHING ALL OF THIS...

12:43.463 --> 12:46.296
ON YOU.

12:46.296 --> 12:50.801
GUYS, I THINK I FIGURED OUT
MR. DAVENPORT'S GAME.

12:50.801 --> 12:53.373
HE CAN'T USE LEO TO
PRESENT THE GRAVITY BELT.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.875
HE'S BLUFFING!

12:54.875 --> 12:58.208
YOU'RE RIGHT!
DAVENPORT NEEDS US BECAUSE WE'RE

12:58.208 --> 13:00.150
TRAINED, FIT,
AND CONDITIONED TO WEAR IT.

13:00.150 --> 13:02.482
AND LEO'S... LEO.

13:04.414 --> 13:07.958
MR. DAVENPORT KNEW
LEO WAS OUR LEADER.

13:07.958 --> 13:10.260
HE THOUGHT IF HE CUT OFF
THE HEAD OF THE BEAST,

13:10.260 --> 13:11.791
THE BEAST WOULD DIE!

13:11.791 --> 13:13.063
WAIT, THERE'S A BEAST,
AND WE'RE GOING TO DIE?!

13:13.063 --> 13:14.564
I DID NOT TRAIN FOR THAT!

13:15.996 --> 13:18.098
I SAY WE CALL DAVENPORT'S BLUFF,

13:18.098 --> 13:20.831
AND AT THE SAME TIME,
GET REVENGE ON LEO.

13:20.831 --> 13:22.802
WE KILL TWO BIRDS
WITH ONE STONE!

13:22.802 --> 13:24.534
WAIT, ARE WE KILLING
BIRDS OR BEASTS?

13:24.534 --> 13:26.206
I AM SO CONFUSED!

13:29.479 --> 13:32.812
UHH!

13:33.844 --> 13:36.186
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
LIGHTER THAN THESE?

13:36.186 --> 13:38.188
LEO, THOSE ARE ONE POUND.

13:41.952 --> 13:44.324
DONALD, WHAT IS HE
DOING WITH MY WEIGHTS?

13:44.324 --> 13:45.996
HE'S GOING
TO THROW HIS BACK OUT.

13:45.996 --> 13:48.458
OH! HEY, MOM.
CHECK ME OUT.

13:48.458 --> 13:51.231
I'M GOING TO BE
BIG D'S TEST PILOT FOR
THE NASA PRESENTATION.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.332
WHAT?!

13:52.332 --> 13:54.434
THAT'S RIGHT.
LITTLE MAN, TOP GUN!

13:54.434 --> 13:55.966
OH, NO!

13:55.966 --> 13:59.169
HE IS NOT TESTING ONE OF YOUR
HALF-BAKED DISASTER GADGETS.

13:59.169 --> 14:02.272
HEY! MY GADGETS HAVE A...

14:02.272 --> 14:03.613
REASONABLE...

14:03.613 --> 14:05.946
SAFETY RECORD.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.049
BESIDES, HE'S NOT
REALLY TESTING ANYTHING.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.420
I JUST TOLD HIM HE IS,

14:10.420 --> 14:11.922
SO HE WOULD SWING
OVER TO MY SIDE.

14:11.922 --> 14:13.523
DIVIDE AND CONQUER, BABY!

14:13.523 --> 14:16.526
SO, YOU'RE PITTING
THE CHILDREN

14:16.526 --> 14:18.959
AGAINST EACH OTHER
FOR YOUR OWN BENEFIT?

14:18.959 --> 14:21.531
YOU SO GET ME.

14:25.435 --> 14:27.137
AND ON SWITCH.

14:27.137 --> 14:29.269
AND PRESTO.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.241
OHH!

14:31.241 --> 14:33.473
LOOK AT YOU!

14:33.473 --> 14:37.407
OH! YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL!

14:37.407 --> 14:40.110
YOU ARE FLOATING PERFECTION!

14:40.110 --> 14:41.551
YOU LITTLE SW--

14:43.583 --> 14:45.485
STILL NOT TALKING TO IT.

14:49.259 --> 14:51.361
OH! HEY, GUYS.

14:51.361 --> 14:53.593
DID YOU COME HERE TO GROVEL?

14:53.593 --> 14:55.425
PROCEED!

14:55.425 --> 14:57.167
UH, NO.

14:57.167 --> 14:59.569
ACTUALLY, WE CAME TO CHECK
ON YOUR NEW TEST PILOT.

15:00.670 --> 15:02.602
YOU REALLY WANT
TO REPLACE US WITH LEO,

15:02.602 --> 15:04.004
WE SHOULD REALLY
MAKE SURE HE'S UP TO IT.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.276
OH! LEO IS UP TO IT.

15:09.139 --> 15:11.481
IT'S A HAND CRAMP.

15:11.481 --> 15:14.614
LOOK, IF YOU'RE REPLACING
US WITH LEO,

15:14.614 --> 15:17.017
SHOULDN'T HE BE DOING
THE SAME TRAINING THAT WE DID?

15:17.017 --> 15:18.949
OH, NO. I MEAN,
I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARY.

15:18.949 --> 15:21.451
OH! BUT WE DO.

15:21.451 --> 15:23.053
I MEAN, UNLESS, OF COURSE,

15:23.053 --> 15:25.555
YOU'VE BEEN BLUFFING
THIS ENTIRE TIME.

15:25.555 --> 15:27.627
AND YOU REALLY HAVE NO INTENTION

15:27.627 --> 15:29.429
OF LETTING LEO
TEST THE GRAVITY BELT.

15:30.500 --> 15:33.533
OKAY. FINE.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.505
WHY DON'T WE START
WITH SOME PUSHUPS?

15:37.337 --> 15:40.210
OR A PUSHUP.

15:40.210 --> 15:44.544
NO. LEO HAS
TO TRAIN EXACTLY AS WE DID.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.516
THROW HIM IN THE DEEP END.

15:46.516 --> 15:48.478
YEAH, BIG D.
THROW ME IN THE DEEP END.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.221
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND
TO GET MY FLOATIES.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.455
UHH.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.227
GOOD WORK!

15:57.227 --> 15:58.388
THAT WAS HEAVY.

15:59.429 --> 16:00.430
THAT'S NOT HEAVY.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.438
AH!

16:10.500 --> 16:11.541
THAT'S HEAVY.

16:11.541 --> 16:13.103
Leo: I'M OKAY!

16:14.104 --> 16:16.606
OKAY, LEO.
TEN MORE SECONDS.

16:16.606 --> 16:18.748
WAY TO FOCUS
UNDER PRESSURE.

16:20.550 --> 16:22.052
THAT IS NOT PRESSURE.

16:26.356 --> 16:27.357
AHH!

16:28.388 --> 16:30.120
STOP!

16:32.492 --> 16:34.524
THAT'S PRESSURE.

16:34.524 --> 16:36.566
Leo: I'M OKAY!

16:42.702 --> 16:44.234
THIS IS AWESOME!

16:44.234 --> 16:46.176
THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE
IN BEGINNER MODE.

16:46.176 --> 16:49.379
WHY DON'T WE TEST
YOUR REACTION TIME
IN, UH, COMBAT MODE.

16:49.379 --> 16:50.380
UH?

16:52.082 --> 16:53.413
OH! OHH!

16:55.215 --> 16:57.187
OKAY. OKAY!

17:04.554 --> 17:05.625
YES!

17:05.625 --> 17:08.598
WASTING MY LIFE PLAYING
VIDEO GAMES FINALLY PAID OFF.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.031
HERE WE GO.

17:14.104 --> 17:15.704
Leo: I'M OKAY!

17:18.137 --> 17:19.309
HA HA HA!

17:19.309 --> 17:21.340
CONGRATULATIONS, LEO.

17:21.340 --> 17:23.673
YOU HAVE COMPLETED
EVERY TRAINING TEST

17:23.673 --> 17:26.376
NECESSARY FOR
THE GRAVITY BELT PRESENTATION.

17:26.376 --> 17:27.577
HOW MANY DID HE PASS?

17:27.577 --> 17:29.048
HE COMPLETED THEM!

17:29.048 --> 17:30.580
JUST GIVE IT UP!

17:30.580 --> 17:33.223
WE ALL KNOW YOU'RE
NOT LETTING LEO GO
UP IN THAT THING.

17:33.223 --> 17:35.525
OH, YES, I WILL, MISSY!

17:37.257 --> 17:39.529
THE NASA REP WILL
BE HERE ANY SECOND NOW,

17:39.529 --> 17:41.791
AND LEO IS GOOD TO GO.

17:41.791 --> 17:43.463
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU GUYS WANT
TO END THIS RIGHT NOW

17:43.463 --> 17:45.295
AND HELP ME
WITH THE PRESENTATION.

17:45.295 --> 17:48.198
NOT UNLESS YOU'RE
READY TO GIVE US MORE TIME OFF.

17:48.198 --> 17:49.369
NOT A CHANCE!

17:49.369 --> 17:51.241
ALL RIGHT. FINE.

17:51.241 --> 17:52.672
THEN LET'S BELT YOU UP, LEO!

17:52.672 --> 17:53.803
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

17:53.803 --> 17:57.107
UH-UH, YEAH, THAT'S-THAT'S,
HEY! THAT'S FINE.

17:57.107 --> 18:00.550
YOU KNOW, I AM 100%
COMFORTABLE WITH THIS!

18:00.550 --> 18:01.811
( doorbell )
 AHH!

18:01.811 --> 18:04.484
NASA REP! OKAY.
TAKE IT OFF!
TAKE IT OFF!

18:04.484 --> 18:05.615
HELP ME WITH
THE PRESENTATION!

18:05.615 --> 18:06.656
I'LL GIVE YOU
ANYTHING YOU WANT!

18:06.656 --> 18:08.558
I WANT A PURPLE PONY
NAMED "BLUE"!

18:10.690 --> 18:12.392
WHAT? YOU SAID ANYTHING.

18:13.463 --> 18:14.794
WE WANT YOU TO BE FAIR.

18:14.794 --> 18:17.527
WE WORK HARD
AND DESERVE TIME OFF.

18:17.527 --> 18:19.299
JUST THINK ABOUT THAT
THE NEXT TIME

18:19.299 --> 18:21.231
BEFORE YOU AUTOMATICALLY SAY NO.

18:21.231 --> 18:23.233
YEAH. YOU HAVE TO KNOW
WHEN TO BE OUR BOSS,

18:23.233 --> 18:24.504
AND WHEN TO BE OUR DAD.

18:24.504 --> 18:28.107
AND OUR DAD WOULD KNOW
WHEN WE NEED A DAY OFF.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.510
MM-HMM. THE "DAD" CARD.
WELL PLAYED.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.581
( doorbell )

18:31.581 --> 18:33.713
COME ON, GUYS!
PLEASE?

18:33.713 --> 18:36.186
DO WE GET A DAY OFF, EVERY WEEK,
TO DO WHATEVER WE WANT?

18:37.717 --> 18:40.650
I'LL LET YOU RIDE BLUE.

18:40.650 --> 18:41.591
( doorbell )

18:41.591 --> 18:43.223
FINE!
WHATEVER YOU GUYS WANT!

18:43.223 --> 18:45.755
OKAY. I HEAR YOU, UH...
MORE DAD, LESS BOSS.

18:45.755 --> 18:47.897
LISTENING...
YADA-YADA-YADA.
ARE WE GOOD?

18:47.897 --> 18:48.898
DEAL!
 DONE!

18:48.898 --> 18:50.630
YES! WAIT.
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

18:50.630 --> 18:52.662
LEO, GIVE THE BELT TO ADAM.

18:52.662 --> 18:53.633
( doorbell )

18:53.633 --> 18:55.665
ISN'T ANYBODY
GOING TO GET THE DOOR?

18:55.665 --> 18:57.667
NO! OHH!

18:57.667 --> 18:59.169
HEY, HEY, HEY!

18:59.169 --> 19:00.410
JERRY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

19:00.410 --> 19:01.471
HI. GOOD TO SEE YOU.

19:01.471 --> 19:02.642
Donald: LOOKING GOOD.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.873
LEO GIVE THE BELT TO ADAM.

19:05.415 --> 19:06.476
( beeping )

19:06.476 --> 19:07.547
WHAT WAS THAT?

19:07.547 --> 19:08.848
THE ON SWITCH.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.280
WHAT?!

19:10.280 --> 19:11.521
WHOA!

19:11.521 --> 19:12.682
DONALD! DO SOMETHING!

19:13.853 --> 19:17.257
LEO, GRAB ON TO SOMETHING!

19:17.257 --> 19:18.428
AHH!

19:19.589 --> 19:20.630
AH!

19:21.631 --> 19:23.893
NO! NO! STOP IT!

19:23.893 --> 19:24.894
NO! WHY?

19:27.367 --> 19:30.300
( screaming )

19:33.703 --> 19:36.776
WHY DO WE KEEP GETTING
 GLASS DINING TABLES?

19:36.776 --> 19:38.648
AS YOU CAN SEE,
IT ACTUALLY WORKS PRETTY WELL.

19:38.648 --> 19:43.553
UH, COMES IN BLACK, GRAY, GREEN,
MAGENTA, PINK FOR THE LADY-NAUT.

19:43.553 --> 19:45.415
IF YOU WANT
A LITTLE RHINESTONE--

19:45.415 --> 19:46.716
EXCUSE ME... I GOT TO...

19:50.760 --> 19:52.492
I'M GOOD!
I'M GOOD.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.623
AHH!

19:58.398 --> 19:59.429
WHOA!

20:01.200 --> 20:03.973
IT WORKS A LOT BETTER
ON A NORMAL-SIZED PERSON.

20:03.973 --> 20:05.635
LEO!

20:05.635 --> 20:06.636
HERE WE GO.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.940
HE WENT THROUGH THE ROOF!

20:12.582 --> 20:14.544
HEY! SEE IF MY
FOOTBALL'S UP THERE.

20:16.246 --> 20:17.247
HERE HE COMES!

20:18.518 --> 20:22.522
HOW DID I GET OUTSIDE?!

20:23.853 --> 20:25.695
Leo: THERE'S THE OFF SWITCH.

20:25.695 --> 20:27.727
( thump )

20:29.699 --> 20:32.302
I'M OKAY!

20:32.302 --> 20:34.003
OHH!

20:34.003 --> 20:35.505
WHERE'S MY FOOTBALL?

20:39.639 --> 20:42.712
AND THAT CONCLUDES
OUR PRESENTATION.

20:43.713 --> 20:45.244
WAIT!

20:45.244 --> 20:47.577
WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO BE ABLE
TO DO THAT ON ANOTHER PLANET?

20:47.577 --> 20:50.480
I MEAN, YOU BUY ALL
KINDS OF JUNK THAT DOESN'T WORK!

21:01.931 --> 21:02.962
HEY GUYS!

21:05.295 --> 21:07.837
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I JUST...

21:07.837 --> 21:09.939
I WANTED TO BE
LIKE YOU GUYS SO MUCH

21:09.939 --> 21:11.871
THAT I LOST TRACK OF WHAT'S
MOST IMPORTANT.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.343
OUR FRIENDSHIP.

21:13.343 --> 21:16.976
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET
IT MAKES ME WANT TO... BLAH!

21:19.979 --> 21:21.551
YEAH, I GUESS I CAN FORGIVE YOU.

21:21.551 --> 21:22.752
YEAH, ME TOO.

21:22.752 --> 21:23.783
IT'S ALL GOOD.

21:25.014 --> 21:28.418
SO, ARE YOU EVER PLANNING ON
TAKING THAT OUTFIT OFF?

21:28.418 --> 21:29.819
WELL, NO.

21:29.819 --> 21:32.692
IT'S THE CLOSEST I'M
EVER GOING TO GET
TO A MISSION SUIT.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.664
YOU CAN'T GET IT OFF,
CAN YOU?

21:34.664 --> 21:37.367
IT'S ADHERED TO ME IN
A WAY I'M NO LONGER
COMFORTABLE WITH.
