WEBVTT

00:00.053 --> 00:01.806
Previously on Station 19.

00:01.807 --> 00:04.413
I don't have some fear of
fire, don't be ridiculous.

00:04.467 --> 00:06.753
- That I want more.
- I still do.

00:06.780 --> 00:08.386
I saw Jack shirt

00:08.434 --> 00:10.779
on the ground outside
the captain's bedroom.

00:10.813 --> 00:11.726
I know.

00:11.760 --> 00:14.603
For the past few months,
we've been seeing each other.

00:14.604 --> 00:15.737
Is one of you gonna leave?

00:15.771 --> 00:17.672
No, because we broke up.

00:17.707 --> 00:19.174
You are getting sicker.

00:19.208 --> 00:21.810
What the hell are you doing here?

00:27.950 --> 00:29.384
Have you ever noticed

00:29.418 --> 00:31.353
that you never see
firefighters working alone?

00:31.387 --> 00:32.954
So, I have some news.

00:32.989 --> 00:34.789
Something good?

00:34.824 --> 00:38.026
Work in sync, work in pairs.

00:38.060 --> 00:39.261
Trust your partner.

00:39.295 --> 00:43.231
Yeah. I got offered a job in New York.

00:43.266 --> 00:45.967
And I'm thinking about taking it.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.534
I don't know.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.971
It just feels like there's a
professional ceiling in Seattle,

00:50.006 --> 00:53.942
but when in New York, you
know, the sky's the limit.

00:53.976 --> 00:55.944
That way, you never get left all alone.

00:55.978 --> 00:58.480
There could be other reasons
to stay in Seattle.

00:59.751 --> 01:02.717
I thought you'd be a little
bit excited for me, Piper.

01:02.752 --> 01:04.052
Sorry.

01:04.086 --> 01:06.221
I am. I'm just surprised.

01:06.255 --> 01:08.089
That's great.

01:08.124 --> 01:09.457
- You'll love it.
- Yeah.

01:14.530 --> 01:16.665
But, Finley, I...

01:18.267 --> 01:20.802
Something should do something
about those damn potholes!

01:20.836 --> 01:22.938
Alone leaves you vulnerable.

01:22.972 --> 01:24.506
Alone leaves you exposed.

01:24.540 --> 01:26.251
And while, at first,
that might not seem like

01:26.275 --> 01:28.143
that big a deal...

01:28.177 --> 01:32.013
if it happens often enough...

01:32.048 --> 01:33.949
it's bound to catch up to you.

01:33.983 --> 01:37.352
So, you just ran.
From Ryan's front porch.

01:37.386 --> 01:39.187
- Like a stalker.
- Not a stalker.

01:39.221 --> 01:42.157
A person who thought she knew
what she wanted to say,

01:42.191 --> 01:44.002
but at the last minute
changed her mind too late

01:44.026 --> 01:45.427
because doorbell,

01:45.461 --> 01:47.680
so I hid in the bushes and said nothing

01:47.714 --> 01:50.298
and just... watched him go back inside.

01:50.333 --> 01:51.933
Like a stalker.

01:51.968 --> 01:55.036
Look, my dad'll want
to eat cheese steaks today

01:55.071 --> 01:56.204
with everyone else.

01:56.238 --> 01:58.139
Don't let him. Make him eat this.

01:58.174 --> 02:00.308
Okay, I don't know if I can
make your dad do anything.

02:00.343 --> 02:01.376
Guilt him, then.

02:01.410 --> 02:02.454
Tell him I spent my whole morning

02:02.478 --> 02:03.488
making him a healthy lunch

02:03.512 --> 02:05.880
when I should have been
focusing on my test today.

02:05.915 --> 02:07.649
Which we both know you have in the bag.

02:07.683 --> 02:09.184
You already aced the written exam.

02:09.217 --> 02:11.386
Today is gonna be a piece of cake.

02:11.420 --> 02:14.222
Today will be the hardest
thing you've ever attempted.

02:14.256 --> 02:16.124
- In your life.
- Morning.

02:16.158 --> 02:18.493
This is for you.
Maya's gonna give you a ride.

02:18.527 --> 02:22.230
I am perfectly capable of
feeding and driving myself.

02:22.264 --> 02:24.332
You know what this test
is called, correct?

02:24.367 --> 02:26.067
The Incinerator!

02:26.102 --> 02:29.070
Because it can burn you alive. Literally.

02:29.105 --> 02:31.072
And figuratively.

02:31.107 --> 02:33.041
It's designed to test every single aspect

02:33.075 --> 02:34.309
it takes to be captain.

02:34.343 --> 02:36.311
I know, Dad. I know.

02:36.345 --> 02:39.214
Do you know, the day I took
the test, somebody died?

02:39.248 --> 02:41.082
This is not a chaste little drill.

02:41.117 --> 02:43.885
It's a real fire in a real building.

02:43.919 --> 02:45.487
They call it a controlled burn,

02:45.521 --> 02:48.690
but fire isn't something that
any of us can really control.

02:48.724 --> 02:50.068
The only way to get through this test

02:50.092 --> 02:51.659
is to show it who's boss.

02:51.694 --> 02:53.695
Luckily, I boss very well.

02:53.729 --> 02:54.805
Eat.

02:54.839 --> 02:56.097
That's probably Jack.

02:56.132 --> 02:57.332
Jack?

02:57.366 --> 02:59.701
Yes, Jack.

02:59.735 --> 03:01.369
We're carpooling to the test.

03:01.404 --> 03:03.071
Curious choice.

03:04.907 --> 03:07.108
Just because we broke up
doesn't mean we can't sit

03:07.143 --> 03:09.631
in a car together for 20 stupid minutes.

03:14.216 --> 03:16.051
- Good luck!
- Suerte!

03:18.988 --> 03:20.588
You're not Jack.

03:20.623 --> 03:21.923
I am not.

03:22.664 --> 03:24.726
I brought you a good-luck charm.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.127
What?

03:26.162 --> 03:28.229
I haven't seen this in years!

03:28.264 --> 03:30.142
Because the last time
we passed it back and forth

03:30.166 --> 03:32.267
was the morning I tested
for the police academy.

03:32.301 --> 03:34.369
- Yeah.
- Worked. I got in.

03:34.403 --> 03:35.614
I remember handing this thing off

03:35.638 --> 03:37.872
in the halls at school, during finals.

03:37.907 --> 03:39.908
And pretty much any time
we got in after curfew.

03:39.942 --> 03:42.410
I-I think you brought it
to me in juvie once.

03:42.445 --> 03:44.312
And you, you slipped it into my pocket

03:44.346 --> 03:46.181
before I got on the plane to New York.

03:47.650 --> 03:49.050
To bring my dad home.

03:51.882 --> 03:53.421
See?

03:53.759 --> 03:55.390
Works every time.

03:57.927 --> 03:59.794
Ryan, I wanted to talk to you.

03:59.829 --> 04:01.129
Morning.

04:06.135 --> 04:08.269
I was just dropping by
to wish Andy luck today.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.406
How neighborly of you.

04:12.875 --> 04:14.175
Well.

04:14.210 --> 04:16.411
Um, we should go.

04:23.652 --> 04:30.811
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

04:37.199 --> 04:39.634
Andy and Jack left Montgomery in charge?

04:39.668 --> 04:41.803
Well, he's got seniority.

04:44.140 --> 04:46.441
You are looking sharp, Montgomery.

04:46.475 --> 04:48.810
Bishop, can you check the bottles...

04:48.844 --> 04:50.489
and make sure
that they're all topped off?

04:50.513 --> 04:51.880
Miller.

04:51.914 --> 04:53.681
Are we all stocked up
on cleaning supplies?

04:53.716 --> 04:56.184
Did you get your uniform
professionally pressed?

04:56.218 --> 04:59.320
Also, I'd like
a complete list of inventory

04:59.355 --> 05:00.555
on my desk by 11:00.

05:00.589 --> 05:02.056
You did.

05:02.091 --> 05:04.192
You starched your collar.

05:04.226 --> 05:06.794
You know this is only
for one shift, right?

05:06.829 --> 05:07.896
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:07.930 --> 05:10.131
Hey, so, I was looking at
the new vehicle assignments.

05:10.166 --> 05:13.401
Yes. A finely honed balance.

05:13.435 --> 05:15.236
Each individual assignment

05:15.271 --> 05:18.973
carefully, purposefully selected.

05:19.772 --> 05:22.010
Right. So, I was thinking that, um,

05:22.044 --> 05:25.380
since you're acting captain,
don't you want to be on truck?

05:25.414 --> 05:26.748
Instead of Aid Car?

05:26.782 --> 05:29.312
The captain should be on truck, right?

05:30.085 --> 05:31.886
- Right. Yes, you're right.
- Yeah.

05:31.921 --> 05:33.388
- Yeah.
- I should be on the truck.

05:33.422 --> 05:35.190
- Duh.
- Thanks. Thank you.

05:35.224 --> 05:37.225
- Of course.
- Can you do Aid Car?

05:37.259 --> 05:38.435
Whatever you want.

05:38.469 --> 05:40.061
- Right. Thanks.
- Yeah.

05:53.075 --> 05:56.177
I told Maya and my dad that
you and I could get along.

05:56.212 --> 05:57.679
That we weren't children

05:57.713 --> 06:00.281
who have to give each other
the silent treatment.

06:03.452 --> 06:07.388
So let's not give each other
the silent treatment, okay?

06:07.423 --> 06:08.957
Especially not today, of all days.

06:08.991 --> 06:10.268
I think it's best if we just stay out

06:10.292 --> 06:11.492
of each other's way today.

06:13.229 --> 06:15.263
Do what we're there to do.

06:17.633 --> 06:19.133
Keep our distance.

06:20.336 --> 06:22.470
Jack, when one of us is named captain,

06:22.504 --> 06:25.940
we have to figure out how to get along.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.996
Yup.

06:30.012 --> 06:31.579
But not today.

06:39.421 --> 06:41.789
Morning, Gibson.

06:41.824 --> 06:43.458
Herrera, you're late.

06:44.593 --> 06:47.395
Are... Are all these people
testing for captain, too?

06:47.429 --> 06:49.464
I thought there'd be five or six, tops.

06:49.935 --> 06:51.432
Grab a spot, Herrera.

06:57.206 --> 06:59.140
Is that the fire chief?

07:02.344 --> 07:04.279
Didn't know he'd be here.

07:04.313 --> 07:07.282
Great. Because, otherwise,
today was gonna be too easy.

07:07.316 --> 07:10.952
You are the candidates with
the highest written exam scores.

07:10.986 --> 07:14.322
And today you'll put
all that theory into practice

07:14.356 --> 07:16.658
by each of you leading a group of four

07:16.692 --> 07:18.926
through a call inside the warehouse.

07:18.961 --> 07:20.828
The goal is to extinguish a fire

07:20.863 --> 07:24.365
and rescue a 200-pound dummy
as quickly as possible.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.434
And these rankings will follow you

07:26.468 --> 07:28.369
throughout your application process.

07:28.404 --> 07:33.441
If you are unable to retrieve
the dummy at all, you forfeit.

07:33.475 --> 07:35.476
I'm sure Fire Chief Ripley here

07:35.511 --> 07:37.011
needs no introduction to this group,

07:37.046 --> 07:40.014
and I know he would like
to say a few words.

07:41.517 --> 07:42.534
Listen, guys.

07:42.569 --> 07:44.152
Today is not about winning,

07:44.186 --> 07:46.387
so wash that out of your minds.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.489
Today... and every day moving forward

07:48.524 --> 07:50.525
if you're chosen as captain...

07:50.559 --> 07:54.028
is about being a leader,
so focus on that.

07:54.916 --> 07:57.332
If you're physically unable to continue,

07:57.366 --> 07:58.399
Aid Cars are standing by.

07:58.434 --> 07:59.467
Report into them.

07:59.501 --> 08:01.836
I am not in the mood
to lose a firefighter today,

08:01.870 --> 08:03.805
so, please, no heroics.

08:03.839 --> 08:05.707
- Got it?
- Do you think there's a day

08:05.741 --> 08:08.543
when she's ever in the mood
to lose a firefighter?

08:08.577 --> 08:10.345
Charlotte Dearborn, Station 12.

08:10.379 --> 08:11.446
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.391
Do you have something to add,
Lieutenant Dearborn?

08:13.415 --> 08:15.583
Out of curiosity, how many captain spots

08:15.617 --> 08:17.585
are open in the department this year?

08:17.619 --> 08:18.755
Does that matter?

08:18.789 --> 08:21.484
Just like to know my odds
before heading in.

08:22.652 --> 08:24.492
This year, there's just one.

08:24.779 --> 08:26.494
Station 19.

08:28.564 --> 08:30.932
The teams are gonna be
assigned alphabetically.

08:30.966 --> 08:33.121
First squad is...

08:34.370 --> 08:37.105
Dearborn, Edmonds, Gibson, Herrera.

08:38.107 --> 08:41.409
Guess we're stuck together
today after all.

08:41.443 --> 08:42.610
Guess we are.

08:57.525 --> 08:59.226
Station 19. How may I help you?

09:02.096 --> 09:04.998
Yeah.

09:05.032 --> 09:07.501
Let me get your contact info.

09:07.535 --> 09:09.503
Can you hold just a minute?

09:09.537 --> 09:11.137
Sir, are you all right?

09:11.172 --> 09:12.583
Do you need to lie down or...
What do you need?

09:12.607 --> 09:13.540
I need you to mind your own business.

09:13.574 --> 09:15.319
Give me the phone.
With all due respect, sir,

09:15.343 --> 09:16.443
should you even be here?

09:16.477 --> 09:17.855
Maybe you need to go home, you know?

09:17.879 --> 09:19.946
- Get some rest?
- Miller, the phone.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.483
Yes, sir.

09:24.619 --> 09:25.786
Preschool down the block...

09:25.820 --> 09:28.488
They want to bring
the kids by for a tour.

09:28.523 --> 09:29.856
They're on line 2.

09:29.891 --> 09:31.591
Copy.

09:37.732 --> 09:39.833
Pruitt Herrera. Can I help you?

09:39.867 --> 09:41.701
Jack Gibson, 19.

09:41.736 --> 09:43.203
Charlotte Dearborn, 12.

09:43.237 --> 09:46.172
- Cole Edmonds, 7.
- Andy Herrera, 19.

09:46.207 --> 09:48.675
Both of you from 19.
That's complicated.

09:48.709 --> 09:49.720
Tell me the stories are true...

09:49.744 --> 09:51.378
great calls, great crew,

09:51.412 --> 09:52.646
best stats in the department?

09:52.680 --> 09:55.649
- All true. Every word.
- We get the job done.

09:55.683 --> 09:57.651
Let's see who gets to play captain first.

09:57.685 --> 09:58.785
Number draw time.

09:58.819 --> 10:00.797
One thing's for sure...
You do not want to go last,

10:00.821 --> 10:03.189
when everybody's fried
and the building is trashed.

10:03.224 --> 10:04.658
First! Sweet!

10:04.692 --> 10:07.394
- What'd you get?
- Um, last.

10:07.428 --> 10:09.529
- Goody.
- All right, guys, huddle up!

10:09.564 --> 10:11.831
All right.

10:11.866 --> 10:13.533
Nod at me or something,

10:13.568 --> 10:14.878
like you're agreeing with me right now.

10:14.902 --> 10:16.870
Agreeing with you about what?

10:16.904 --> 10:18.415
Look, Ripley never comes to these things.

10:18.439 --> 10:19.424
Today's a big deal.

10:19.459 --> 10:21.474
We just need to seem impressive.

10:21.509 --> 10:22.642
You know, like a team.

10:22.677 --> 10:25.345
So this is a fake inspirational huddle?

10:25.379 --> 10:27.147
All right!

10:27.181 --> 10:29.149
Teamwork makes the dream work,

10:29.183 --> 10:30.304
right, guys?

10:30.338 --> 10:32.185
We're gonna do this!

10:37.458 --> 10:39.659
On my count.

10:39.694 --> 10:42.929
3, 2, 1!

10:44.298 --> 10:46.399
Come on, you guys.
Let's do this together!

10:46.434 --> 10:47.701
Whoo!

10:49.303 --> 10:51.037
Fire ahead!

10:51.072 --> 10:52.706
Judging from the amount of smoke,

10:52.740 --> 10:54.240
it's not the only one burning.

10:54.275 --> 10:55.542
We should probably split off.

10:55.576 --> 10:56.676
This ain't my first rodeo.

10:56.711 --> 10:58.778
Ladies, grab the secondary hose.

10:58.813 --> 11:00.691
Gibson and I will head in first
to handle this one.

11:00.715 --> 11:02.782
We can follow you in
and hit those flames, too.

11:02.817 --> 11:04.351
I'd prefer it if you stay back here

11:04.385 --> 11:05.862
and cover us like I asked, okay, hon?

11:05.886 --> 11:07.120
We got it.

11:09.957 --> 11:12.258
Did he just call you "hon"?

11:24.939 --> 11:26.773
Is that helping?

11:29.310 --> 11:30.877
Just testing the tools.

11:30.911 --> 11:32.623
Gotta keep them ready
for when we need them.

11:32.647 --> 11:35.048
Yeah, I...

11:35.082 --> 11:37.717
I think you know that's not what I meant.

11:37.752 --> 11:39.919
Here we go.

11:39.954 --> 11:42.789
I've been watching you avoid fires

11:42.823 --> 11:44.724
basically every shift for weeks.

11:44.759 --> 11:46.660
Yeah, and it's working like a charm.

11:46.694 --> 11:47.894
Everything's fine.

11:47.928 --> 11:50.296
No, everything's not fine.

11:50.331 --> 11:51.775
I've been keeping this secret for you,

11:51.799 --> 11:52.766
but what are you doing?

11:52.800 --> 11:55.435
You're... You're turning
blowtorches on and off?

11:55.469 --> 11:57.570
You need to get some help,
talk to someone.

11:57.605 --> 11:59.082
Yeah, I don't owe you a progress report.

11:59.106 --> 12:00.907
Look, I've seen this before.

12:00.941 --> 12:02.842
I've seen surgeons
get themselves so rattled

12:02.877 --> 12:04.577
they're afraid to cut.

12:04.612 --> 12:06.356
If it goes on too long,
it can mess with your head,

12:06.380 --> 12:08.448
and if that happens,
it is hard to get out.

12:08.482 --> 12:10.027
I really don't need you
to "doctor" me right now.

12:10.051 --> 12:11.818
If you would just...

12:11.852 --> 12:13.112
Station 19. Respond. Trapped victim.

12:13.136 --> 12:14.567
Vic, don't...

12:19.727 --> 12:21.494
Fire's out back there.

12:21.529 --> 12:23.963
- Where do you need us next?
- We've swept a dozen rooms.

12:23.998 --> 12:26.199
The dummy must be on the
other side of this crawl space.

12:26.233 --> 12:27.767
It's gonna be a tight squeeze.

12:27.802 --> 12:29.112
Send me or Herrera. We're smaller.

12:29.136 --> 12:30.336
We can navigate through.

12:30.371 --> 12:31.337
That's very sweet of you to offer,

12:31.372 --> 12:33.092
but I don't wanna get
held up in here today.

12:34.208 --> 12:35.942
Gibson, stay on my six, will you?

12:35.976 --> 12:37.310
You ladies, you stay here.

12:37.344 --> 12:38.912
We'll holler if we get hung up.

12:40.748 --> 12:41.915
Excuse me, hon.

12:43.718 --> 12:45.552
That's not my name.

12:45.586 --> 12:46.786
Thanks.

12:46.821 --> 12:48.888
So, once again, we're sidelined.

12:48.923 --> 12:50.123
- Doing "lady" jobs.
- Yeah.

12:50.157 --> 12:51.891
I'd like to see him pull
that kind of thing

12:51.926 --> 12:53.193
in front of Frankel.

12:53.227 --> 12:55.258
You think he actually has a shot?

12:55.930 --> 12:58.469
I think everybody here has a shot.

12:58.899 --> 13:00.967
You know 19's a bit of a legend, right?

13:01.001 --> 13:03.336
I mean, I know it's a great station.

13:03.370 --> 13:04.804
To me, anyway.

13:04.839 --> 13:06.806
You kidding? To everybody.

13:06.841 --> 13:08.989
Must be weird to think of someone
else coming in to run it.

13:09.013 --> 13:11.911
Yeah, I hadn't realized
it was the only spot open.

13:11.946 --> 13:14.414
Come on, ladies! Coming your way!

13:14.448 --> 13:16.816
Okay, sugar pie cupcake boo!

13:16.851 --> 13:17.851
See you soon!

13:17.885 --> 13:19.152
I won't,

13:19.186 --> 13:20.086
but it is so tempting

13:20.121 --> 13:22.055
to just stick my boot out and trip him.

13:29.697 --> 13:31.898
- Hey, nice job.
- Made good time.

13:31.932 --> 13:33.500
Impressive.

13:33.534 --> 13:35.568
Hey, good job.

13:37.705 --> 13:39.038
That was really fast.

13:39.073 --> 13:40.707
Definitely better than last time.

13:40.741 --> 13:41.741
I'm pretty sure it was.

13:41.776 --> 13:43.181
Probably was.

13:44.411 --> 13:45.712
Yeah? Do you want to sign on?

13:45.746 --> 13:46.957
What... What is there to talk about?

13:46.981 --> 13:49.215
- The stopwatch is the judge.
- Dunno.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.918
Sometimes we ladies really
have to talk things over,

13:51.952 --> 13:54.020
you know, with a big, tall man.

13:54.054 --> 13:56.389
Super helpful.

14:00.161 --> 14:02.729
Have fun in there with your new buddy?

14:02.763 --> 14:04.464
The guy's a tool.

14:04.498 --> 14:05.965
Ego on steroids.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.744
Yeah, I mean, we can't
have somebody like him

14:07.768 --> 14:08.802
taking over our station.

14:08.836 --> 14:09.980
We've really gotta be on our game.

14:10.004 --> 14:13.373
He made good time, a time
we're both gonna have to beat.

14:15.576 --> 14:17.840
Sure, okay.

14:35.162 --> 14:36.896
Where's our Vic?

14:36.931 --> 14:38.832
I don't get it. This is the address.

14:38.866 --> 14:39.946
Double-check with dispatch.

14:39.981 --> 14:41.401
Find out where they need us to go.

14:41.435 --> 14:43.903
Help! Help!

14:44.972 --> 14:45.872
No. My God.

14:45.906 --> 14:48.107
- Hughes, where you going?
- Get up! Get up!

14:48.142 --> 14:49.309
- Get up!
- I can't!

14:49.343 --> 14:51.477
Get out of the street! I can't move!

14:51.512 --> 14:54.013
Hey, get the truck to block off
the traffic right now!

14:54.048 --> 14:55.415
Hughes!

14:55.449 --> 14:57.317
- Stop!
- No, no, no, no, no! No!

14:57.351 --> 14:59.586
Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop!

15:01.062 --> 15:02.196
- Stop! Stop!
- Watch out!

15:02.230 --> 15:04.398
- No!
- You okay?

15:11.905 --> 15:13.572
Hey. Hi.

15:13.607 --> 15:15.374
I'm Victoria. Everyone calls me Vic.

15:15.409 --> 15:16.909
- What's your name?
- Piper.

15:16.943 --> 15:18.978
Okay, Piper. I think I can let go now.

15:19.012 --> 15:20.546
Hughes, you still in one piece?

15:20.580 --> 15:22.114
- Yeah.
- That was ridiculous.

15:22.149 --> 15:24.283
Are you sure you're okay?

15:24.318 --> 15:26.986
- Yeah.
- Okay, follow my finger.

15:27.020 --> 15:30.256
You wanna tell us how you
wound up here in this...

15:30.290 --> 15:31.457
What is that, a pothole?

15:31.491 --> 15:32.635
I was just crossing the street.

15:32.659 --> 15:34.927
I didn't see the hole, and...
and when I stepped in it,

15:34.961 --> 15:36.595
the whole thing just gave way.

15:36.630 --> 15:38.464
Okay, we need to start
rigging up harnesses

15:38.498 --> 15:40.777
and attach them to the truck. I
want everybody ready and secure.

15:40.801 --> 15:42.168
For a pothole?

15:42.202 --> 15:44.270
That could turn into a sinkhole.

15:45.806 --> 15:49.442
Miller, let's maintain a wide
perimeter around this thing.

15:49.476 --> 15:51.010
Will do.

15:51.044 --> 15:52.255
Let's get you out of here, okay?

15:52.279 --> 15:54.313
On the count of three. One, two, three!

15:55.182 --> 15:56.615
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

15:56.650 --> 15:58.284
Okay, the asphalt's piercing her flesh.

15:58.318 --> 16:01.253
You can't pick her up without
ripping her leg to pieces.

16:01.288 --> 16:03.456
So we dig her out?

16:03.490 --> 16:05.323
Yeah, looks that way.

16:06.493 --> 16:08.861
All right, let's do this!

16:08.895 --> 16:11.464
Right.

16:11.498 --> 16:14.600
We've got multiple blazes,
one down that front hall,

16:14.634 --> 16:16.602
another cutting off the offices.

16:16.636 --> 16:19.972
Herrera, you slide down
past the first door

16:20.006 --> 16:21.474
and start your sweep from there.

16:21.508 --> 16:22.785
You want me to go past the fire?

16:22.809 --> 16:24.043
We never do that.

16:24.077 --> 16:25.087
It's just basics.

16:25.122 --> 16:27.012
Herrera's right. We might want to...

16:27.047 --> 16:28.381
Hey, it's my call.

16:28.415 --> 16:31.517
As captain, I'm asking you
to divide and conquer.

16:31.551 --> 16:32.551
Go on.

16:32.586 --> 16:34.387
Go divide! Go conquer!

16:34.421 --> 16:35.988
Come on!

16:36.022 --> 16:39.191
I've got a victim to find,
and I'm on a tight schedule.

16:44.231 --> 16:46.165
I think I remember
a cut-through back there.

16:46.199 --> 16:48.511
Maybe we can get around this,
come at it closer to the source.

16:48.535 --> 16:50.403
- Where are you going?
- I just said.

16:50.437 --> 16:51.757
Yeah, I don't have time for that.

16:56.543 --> 16:59.011
- That's not the safest way.
- You're kidding me.

16:59.045 --> 17:01.147
Better hurry if you want to keep up!

17:06.353 --> 17:07.553
Aha!

17:27.874 --> 17:30.109
See? This is why you're not
supposed to pass the fire

17:30.143 --> 17:31.043
before it's out.

17:31.077 --> 17:33.179
Guys, I could use
a little backup in here.

17:33.213 --> 17:35.548
I got the dummy, but I can't get him out.

17:35.582 --> 17:36.549
Over.

17:36.583 --> 17:38.451
Copy! On our way.

17:38.485 --> 17:39.952
Sit tight.

17:51.331 --> 17:54.533
Herrera, confirm you're clear
before we open up.

17:57.571 --> 17:59.238
Clear!

18:11.618 --> 18:13.452
Yeah!

18:14.955 --> 18:16.288
You all right?

18:18.091 --> 18:20.960
Herrera, nicely done! Up top!

18:25.866 --> 18:27.810
Congratulations, Dearborn.
You just set an all-time record.

18:27.834 --> 18:29.802
Well done.

18:32.539 --> 18:36.098
And that's how it's done, hon.

18:36.930 --> 18:38.577
So, I guess she's the one to beat.

18:38.612 --> 18:40.436
Seems that way.

18:43.216 --> 18:44.783
Just keep an eye out.

18:44.818 --> 18:46.318
If she develops compartment syndrome,

18:46.353 --> 18:48.420
- she could lose her leg.
- Did he just say...

18:48.455 --> 18:50.022
Did you just say lose my leg?

18:50.056 --> 18:51.790
Is that true? Is that gonna happen?

18:51.825 --> 18:53.336
Okay, we are doing
everything in our power

18:53.360 --> 18:54.437
to make sure that doesn't happen.

18:54.461 --> 18:56.686
- Okay.
- Okay?

18:56.721 --> 18:57.763
Okay.

18:57.797 --> 19:00.132
- God! Okay!
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

19:00.166 --> 19:01.700
You live around here?

19:01.735 --> 19:03.602
- I used to.
- Yeah?

19:03.637 --> 19:07.139
Still come by every morning
for coffee and a walk, though.

19:07.173 --> 19:08.974
A good friend of mine lives close.

19:09.009 --> 19:10.876
- Do you want us to call her?
- No!

19:10.911 --> 19:14.513
No. I'd just as soon
she not see me like this.

19:14.548 --> 19:15.948
I'd really rather just go home

19:15.982 --> 19:17.616
and pretend like this never happened.

19:17.651 --> 19:20.019
Hey, you'll still need to go
to the hospital after this.

19:20.053 --> 19:22.388
Might be nice to have
your friend with you.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.855
I've gotta get used to things
without her anyway.

19:25.492 --> 19:26.816
She's moving away.

19:27.661 --> 19:28.943
And I...

19:30.163 --> 19:32.565
I kinda can't bear it.

19:32.599 --> 19:34.667
I was on my way
to talk to her about that,

19:35.408 --> 19:37.903
but the universe clearly had other ideas.

19:37.938 --> 19:39.838
I got all the way home,

19:39.873 --> 19:41.874
I thought about it, I came back,

19:41.908 --> 19:44.410
and then I didn't get two steps
across this stupid street

19:44.444 --> 19:47.179
before my leg got trapped
inside a damn pothole.

19:47.213 --> 19:50.182
And now I just...
I need to go home, okay?

19:50.216 --> 19:51.727
Can you please just get me out
so I can go?

19:51.751 --> 19:53.886
Yeah. We're... We're working on it.

19:59.225 --> 20:01.260
Your calls in there were questionable.

20:01.294 --> 20:02.561
They were dangerous.

20:02.596 --> 20:04.563
You say "dangerous," I say "assertive."

20:04.598 --> 20:06.576
We can't be shy little violets
to conquer this test.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.767
These guys play rough,
we gotta play rougher.

20:08.802 --> 20:09.702
- You feel me?
- No.

20:09.736 --> 20:10.636
Plus, it worked!

20:10.670 --> 20:13.839
I pushed you hard, you did badass things.

20:13.873 --> 20:15.040
- Doesn't it feel good?
- No.

20:15.075 --> 20:17.109
Not when you're putting lives in danger.

20:17.143 --> 20:19.011
Not when you're taking unnecessary risks.

20:19.045 --> 20:21.080
See, now, I know
you were recently promoted.

20:21.114 --> 20:22.748
Here's a pro tip:

20:22.782 --> 20:25.784
You don't get the best
from your team by coddling them.

20:25.819 --> 20:27.386
You've gotta push.

20:27.420 --> 20:29.722
And while I would never want
to squash another woman

20:29.756 --> 20:32.458
just to win this, make no mistake...

20:32.492 --> 20:34.760
I will, if I have to.

20:34.794 --> 20:36.228
I'll do whatever it takes.

20:36.262 --> 20:38.697
So I suggest you stop worrying about me

20:38.732 --> 20:40.933
and start worrying about you.

20:40.967 --> 20:42.635
You've got an uphill climb ahead.

20:42.669 --> 20:44.603
Sure, okay.

20:44.638 --> 20:45.681
You may have been lieutenant longer,

20:45.705 --> 20:48.040
but that doesn't mean
you've got more experience.

20:48.074 --> 20:51.210
In fact, I keep hearing people
say my recent promotion

20:51.244 --> 20:52.945
means I'm not prepared to be captain.

20:52.979 --> 20:55.080
I've helped my father run Station 19

20:55.115 --> 20:56.749
for longer than most people around here

20:56.783 --> 20:57.838
have been doing this job at all,

20:57.862 --> 20:59.718
so unless you became a firefighter

20:59.753 --> 21:01.387
when you were in diapers,

21:01.421 --> 21:04.289
I'm pretty confident I can take you.

21:04.324 --> 21:06.325
I don't mind being underestimated.

21:06.359 --> 21:07.493
That's fine by me.

21:07.527 --> 21:08.827
'Cause all it means is,

21:08.862 --> 21:11.163
it'll be easier for me to sneak in,

21:11.197 --> 21:14.466
rise up, and take the hell over.

21:16.436 --> 21:20.139
You are adorable.

21:20.173 --> 21:22.441
See ya in there.

21:32.128 --> 21:33.673
You ever know something about somebody,

21:33.697 --> 21:35.798
and you don't exactly know
what to do with it?

21:36.570 --> 21:37.784
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:37.809 --> 21:39.086
So out of respect for this person,

21:39.110 --> 21:41.411
you don't do anything with it, obviously,

21:41.446 --> 21:44.214
but it's hard, because,
like, in your heart,

21:44.248 --> 21:45.526
you know that there are other people

21:45.550 --> 21:47.751
who should know about this thing.

21:47.785 --> 21:49.586
- Right.
- Right, so, what do you do?

21:49.620 --> 21:51.131
Do you just, like, keep your mouth shut

21:51.155 --> 21:52.589
and hope for the best?

21:53.212 --> 21:55.759
Hey, a little less slack
on these lines, guys.

21:55.793 --> 21:57.394
And don't let them get tangled.

21:57.428 --> 21:58.939
You're really having us babysit this rope

21:58.963 --> 22:00.797
instead of being up there
tearing up concrete?

22:00.832 --> 22:03.600
If this street gives way,
I need you guys right here

22:03.634 --> 22:05.569
making sure those people
don't go down with it.

22:05.603 --> 22:06.814
All right? I'm not losing anybody

22:06.838 --> 22:08.104
on my first call in charge.

22:08.139 --> 22:09.139
Again, I...

22:09.173 --> 22:10.874
I have to ask.

22:11.647 --> 22:13.510
To a pothole?

22:14.612 --> 22:16.880
Okay, that's fine. Make fun.

22:16.914 --> 22:18.148
You know? Laugh it up.

22:18.182 --> 22:19.455
It's not gonna be as funny

22:19.490 --> 22:22.552
when this entire block
collapses in on itself,

22:22.587 --> 22:26.156
and you are sucked into a giant
hole full of concrete and rebar.

22:26.724 --> 22:28.001
- That just got dark.
- Did not see him going there.

22:28.025 --> 22:29.670
I mean... I mean,
I think this captain thing

22:29.694 --> 22:31.004
- is messing with his head.
- I mean, if you wanna talk,

22:31.028 --> 22:32.172
- it's like, we're here.
- Do it.

22:32.196 --> 22:33.941
Do you think the asphalt's
pinning her femoral artery?

22:33.965 --> 22:35.476
If it is, we need to loosen
the opening elsewhere

22:35.500 --> 22:37.434
and keep that part pinned
as long as possible.

22:37.468 --> 22:41.004
Piper, if your leg starts
to feel too heavy or too tight,

22:41.038 --> 22:42.839
- you let us know, okay?
- Okay.

22:42.874 --> 22:46.076
Ya know, maybe you should
revisit talking to your friend.

22:46.110 --> 22:47.644
She's not...

22:47.678 --> 22:52.516
I mean, she is my friend,
but she's... she's also...

22:52.550 --> 22:55.352
I think she's also more than that, to me.

22:55.386 --> 22:56.653
I think.

22:57.151 --> 22:59.689
I may have felt it for some time now,

22:59.724 --> 23:01.424
but I've never...

23:01.459 --> 23:04.361
I mean, I didn't even realize it
until this morning, and...

23:04.395 --> 23:06.530
She's had girlfriends,
and I've had girlfriends,

23:06.564 --> 23:09.099
but we've never...

23:09.133 --> 23:11.935
I tell her everything.

23:11.969 --> 23:14.752
I-I think I'm in love with her.

23:16.086 --> 23:18.464
And I have no idea how to tell her that.

23:19.423 --> 23:23.346
Maybe... just tell her.

23:23.802 --> 23:25.882
Well, that's easy for you to say.

23:26.305 --> 23:27.884
You guys are fricking fearless.

23:27.919 --> 23:29.642
We're scared of plenty.

23:30.321 --> 23:32.155
I'm scared of plenty.

23:32.189 --> 23:34.824
You dove in front of a giant truck.

23:34.859 --> 23:36.307
I can't even talk to my friend.

23:36.341 --> 23:38.161
Of course you're scared.

23:38.195 --> 23:39.273
You care about what she thinks,

23:39.297 --> 23:42.732
and you don't want her
to think differently about you.

23:42.767 --> 23:44.334
I can't.

23:44.368 --> 23:45.979
I don't know how to talk
about this stuff.

23:46.003 --> 23:47.904
- I just... I...
- Piper?

23:47.939 --> 23:51.007
My God, Piper! What happened?!

23:51.042 --> 23:52.331
Are you okay?

23:53.415 --> 23:55.679
Hey.

24:00.418 --> 24:01.985
All right, fire's clear!

24:02.019 --> 24:03.720
Let's start the sweep for the dummy!

24:03.754 --> 24:04.888
Let's go!

24:19.704 --> 24:23.406
- Nothing?
- Tick tock.

24:26.978 --> 24:28.912
All right, let's sweep again.

24:28.946 --> 24:31.781
This time, everyone checks the
opposite sides of the building.

24:31.816 --> 24:32.882
No stone unturned.

24:32.917 --> 24:34.684
Come on. Really?

24:34.719 --> 24:36.620
We just checked everywhere.

24:36.654 --> 24:39.356
Clearly not everywhere,
or we'd have found the dummy.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.691
Hey, we do what our captain says.

24:41.726 --> 24:43.727
Let's go!

24:48.933 --> 24:50.533
What now, Captain?

24:50.568 --> 24:55.071
At least we know we can
eliminate Gibson as competition.

24:55.106 --> 24:57.207
Hey. Sidebar.

25:00.277 --> 25:01.878
We've done everything in the book,

25:01.912 --> 25:04.581
double-checked every inch of this place.

25:04.615 --> 25:07.050
The only thing left to do is... leave.

25:08.919 --> 25:10.587
I mean, if you're wrong,

25:10.621 --> 25:11.765
this could take you out of the running

25:11.789 --> 25:13.156
for captain completely.

25:13.190 --> 25:16.693
So could staying here.
Searching for nothing.

25:20.031 --> 25:21.898
Your test, your call.

25:21.932 --> 25:23.967
I'll... I'll support whatever you decide.

25:45.156 --> 25:46.690
No dummy?

25:47.946 --> 25:49.259
No, sir.

25:49.293 --> 25:50.794
Not this time.

26:01.038 --> 26:03.106
You are the first candidate in five years

26:03.140 --> 26:05.041
to crack that variation of the test...

26:05.076 --> 26:07.711
and in fantastic time, nonetheless.

26:07.745 --> 26:08.878
You're right.

26:08.913 --> 26:10.613
There was no dummy.

26:10.648 --> 26:11.915
Very impressive.

26:13.751 --> 26:15.185
What's your name again?

26:15.219 --> 26:16.953
Gibson, sir.

26:16.987 --> 26:18.188
Station 19.

26:18.222 --> 26:19.522
All right. Good to know.

26:28.574 --> 26:30.469
- I can't believe this.
- The swelling's getting worse.

26:30.493 --> 26:32.149
I know. Her BP's creeping down.

26:32.174 --> 26:33.875
I mean, these streets are unsafe!

26:33.909 --> 26:35.409
And we will not stand for it.

26:35.444 --> 26:37.712
I don't want you to move away.

26:42.707 --> 26:44.474
Not because I'm not happy for you,

26:44.509 --> 26:47.511
but because I don't want
to not see you again.

26:47.545 --> 26:49.813
I...

26:49.847 --> 26:51.949
I have feelings for you.

26:51.983 --> 26:54.596
More-than-just-friend feelings, and...

26:56.287 --> 26:58.822
I wanted to say it this morning,
and I couldn't.

26:58.856 --> 27:01.091
And then this afternoon,
but then this happened,

27:01.125 --> 27:03.360
and I just... I...

27:03.394 --> 27:05.796
I wasn't even sure how you would take it.

27:05.830 --> 27:08.632
Piper, how I'd take it?

27:08.666 --> 27:10.334
Well, yeah, because...

27:23.333 --> 27:25.849
This isn't exactly how
I imagined our first kiss,

27:25.883 --> 27:29.186
but... I'm not complaining.

27:29.220 --> 27:31.388
Look, if we have something
to say to each other

27:31.422 --> 27:33.991
from now on, let's just say it.

27:34.025 --> 27:35.892
Okay?

27:35.927 --> 27:37.160
Yeah.

27:37.195 --> 27:39.196
Her BP's too low. Most likely caused

27:39.230 --> 27:40.741
by a bleed in her leg below the surface.

27:40.765 --> 27:42.910
We gotta get her outta there.
Even if we have to force it.

27:42.934 --> 27:44.044
Let's get a tourniquet just in case.

27:44.068 --> 27:45.713
And be ready to get her
to the hospital immediately.

27:45.737 --> 27:46.670
Every minute makes a difference.

27:46.704 --> 27:49.473
- Work together, work fast, guys.
- Um, guys...

27:49.507 --> 27:50.818
remember when you told me to let you know

27:50.842 --> 27:52.843
if my leg started to feel tight at all?

27:52.877 --> 27:53.948
Yeah, we know.

27:53.982 --> 27:55.812
We're gonna get you to the hospital ASAP.

27:55.847 --> 27:57.514
I'm going with you.

27:57.548 --> 27:58.815
Okay, but if you can't, it's...

27:58.850 --> 28:00.884
Piper, I mean it.

28:00.918 --> 28:02.247
I'm not going anywhere.

28:04.422 --> 28:06.240
I wish we had more time
to loosen the gravel.

28:06.274 --> 28:08.759
- But we don't.
- Okay. I'll count us in.

28:08.793 --> 28:10.927
- 3, 2, 1.
- You're gonna be okay.

28:10.962 --> 28:11.828
Go.

28:11.863 --> 28:12.963
Come on, keep pulling!

28:12.997 --> 28:14.742
- We got it. We got it.
- A little more. A little more.

28:14.766 --> 28:16.266
We got it.

28:16.301 --> 28:18.435
Come on! Up, up, up!

28:18.469 --> 28:20.003
Let's get her to the Aid Car, right?

28:20.038 --> 28:21.171
Fast. Let's go.

28:30.982 --> 28:32.949
Pretty much zero visibility in here.

28:32.984 --> 28:35.085
Yeah, even the turnout lights
aren't doing much.

28:35.119 --> 28:37.954
We're dealing with residual
smoke from the whole day.

28:37.989 --> 28:39.790
Herrera, you got a plan?

28:44.295 --> 28:45.862
All right.

28:45.897 --> 28:47.431
The whole point of this test

28:47.465 --> 28:48.965
is to prove we can captain a team,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.034
and none of us
have worked that way today.

28:51.069 --> 28:53.537
I want us to trust each other
and work together.

28:53.571 --> 28:55.605
Especially if we're going in blind.

28:58.276 --> 28:59.743
Line up and hold on to each other.

28:59.777 --> 29:01.682
We do this together.

29:02.347 --> 29:03.880
All right.

29:04.268 --> 29:07.150
Everybody call out from their position!

29:07.185 --> 29:09.586
It's the only way to stay
connected in the dark.

29:09.620 --> 29:11.254
Talk to me every step!

29:11.289 --> 29:12.456
- You got it!
- Copy that.

29:12.490 --> 29:13.581
Yes, ma'am!

29:13.616 --> 29:16.293
All right, moving forward another step!

29:16.327 --> 29:17.961
Good!

29:17.995 --> 29:20.731
- Sweeping the floor.
- Nothing.

29:22.367 --> 29:24.668
Hang on!

29:24.702 --> 29:26.937
Encountered something.

29:28.005 --> 29:29.840
Nope, no dummy.

29:29.874 --> 29:31.675
Okay, good.

29:31.709 --> 29:33.310
Moving forward again!

29:33.344 --> 29:34.745
Anything?

29:34.779 --> 29:36.847
- Clear!
- All clear!

29:39.183 --> 29:40.650
What the hell was that?

29:40.685 --> 29:42.018
Pretty sure I don't wanna know.

29:42.053 --> 29:43.820
Keep going! Moving forward!

29:45.056 --> 29:49.092
- That sounds bad.
- Sounds real bad.

29:52.897 --> 29:54.998
Aah!

29:55.032 --> 29:55.766
Aah!

29:55.800 --> 29:59.970
Jack! You all right?! Check in!

30:00.004 --> 30:05.041
- Gibson. Check.
- Dearborn. Check.

30:05.076 --> 30:06.204
Cole?!

30:07.044 --> 30:08.345
Cole, check in!

30:08.379 --> 30:09.880
Who's got hands on Edmonds?

30:09.914 --> 30:13.016
We broke apart
when the ceiling collapsed.

30:13.050 --> 30:14.851
Well, dig through and find him!

30:14.886 --> 30:18.455
- Cole?!
- Edmonds?!

30:18.489 --> 30:20.157
- No, no, no, no.
- Edmonds!

30:20.191 --> 30:21.725
Damn it!

30:21.759 --> 30:23.994
Hey, hold on! Hold on!

30:24.028 --> 30:25.729
I found him.

30:25.763 --> 30:27.631
Is he okay?

30:27.665 --> 30:29.199
Can't tell.

30:29.233 --> 30:30.801
He's knocked out cold.

30:36.073 --> 30:37.808
I'm calling it in.

30:38.743 --> 30:41.178
Charlotte, don't. Don't.

30:41.212 --> 30:43.413
Mayday, mayday. Officer down.

30:43.448 --> 30:45.882
Are you calling for Rapid Intervention?

30:45.917 --> 30:46.817
Negative, we've got him.

30:46.851 --> 30:48.362
We just need to get the hell outta here.

30:48.386 --> 30:50.086
Aid Car on standby at the door.

30:50.121 --> 30:52.055
Everybody out right now.

30:57.795 --> 30:59.930
His pulse is steady. He's coming to.

30:59.964 --> 31:02.098
Andy, come on.

31:02.133 --> 31:03.444
Mayday was called. Mission's over.

31:03.468 --> 31:05.502
You heard Frankel.
Get him out to that Aid Car.

31:05.536 --> 31:07.337
- Stay on the walls.
- Andy, hey.

31:07.371 --> 31:09.105
A huge chunk of ceiling just fell in.

31:09.140 --> 31:10.384
- This building's had it.
- There's still time

31:10.408 --> 31:11.842
before it's completely compromised.

31:11.876 --> 31:13.120
- What are you saying?
- You guys go.

31:13.144 --> 31:14.711
Get Cole the help he needs.

31:14.745 --> 31:15.846
Andy, no.

31:15.880 --> 31:18.181
I'll be right behind you.
As soon as I get the victim.

31:18.216 --> 31:21.251
- Hey, it's just a dummy!
- It's not just a dummy!

31:21.285 --> 31:23.687
It's my shot to captain 19.

31:23.721 --> 31:26.957
Now, I'm not about to surrender
my home to a stranger.

31:26.991 --> 31:28.391
If this were a real call,

31:28.426 --> 31:30.288
I'd never leave that person behind.

31:31.373 --> 31:34.264
Time to show this Incinerator
I'm the boss.

31:40.304 --> 31:42.300
Get him the hell out of here.

31:43.174 --> 31:44.541
Copy that.

31:52.650 --> 31:54.150
You don't have to stay for this.

31:54.185 --> 31:56.152
Buddy system.

31:56.187 --> 31:57.441
I'm not leaving you alone.

32:29.186 --> 32:30.287
Come on!

32:49.941 --> 32:51.041
Very nice job.

32:51.075 --> 32:53.977
- All right, Andy!
- Let's go, Herrera!

32:54.011 --> 32:55.946
- Great stuff!
- Good job!

33:06.424 --> 33:09.059
I made it out. I got the dummy.

33:09.093 --> 33:10.971
When a mayday is called,
you get out immediately.

33:10.995 --> 33:12.706
You don't take your time.
You don't go back in.

33:12.730 --> 33:13.997
I got the victim out.

33:14.031 --> 33:15.175
It was the right thing to do.

33:15.199 --> 33:18.234
No, the right thing to do is
to pay attention to the call.

33:18.269 --> 33:20.337
What you did broke protocol.

33:20.371 --> 33:22.172
What you did was inherently selfish.

33:22.206 --> 33:23.329
By... By going in after a victim?

33:23.353 --> 33:25.875
By trying to get extra points on a test.

33:25.910 --> 33:29.179
By playing a game, instead
of acting like a true captain.

33:29.213 --> 33:31.181
A true captain wouldn't have flinched

33:31.215 --> 33:33.149
if she had the chance
to save a human life.

33:33.184 --> 33:35.719
- A true captain...
- Herrera, is it?

33:35.753 --> 33:36.753
I'm gonna stop you

33:36.787 --> 33:38.755
before you say something more
you might regret.

33:38.789 --> 33:40.867
And, Frankel, I'm stopping you
because I don't like the idea

33:40.891 --> 33:42.102
of reprimanding one of my officers

33:42.126 --> 33:43.493
in front of their candidates.

33:43.527 --> 33:44.995
Reprimand me?

33:45.029 --> 33:48.231
Your job is to evaluate
everyone, unbiased.

33:48.593 --> 33:50.679
We'll talk later.

33:55.573 --> 33:57.741
I understand why you made
the call you did out there.

33:57.775 --> 33:58.908
It's morally admirable,

33:58.943 --> 34:01.054
and it's the kind of thing
that inspires, and that's good.

34:01.078 --> 34:03.279
But our rules are in place for a reason.

34:03.314 --> 34:04.591
And it's a captain's job
to remember that,

34:04.615 --> 34:06.116
even when it isn't convenient.

34:06.150 --> 34:07.884
Now, you got out of there this time.

34:07.918 --> 34:08.996
It's a controlled environment.

34:09.020 --> 34:11.353
But in most cases, we'd be
pulling you, your teammate,

34:11.389 --> 34:12.565
and your victim out in body bags.

34:12.590 --> 34:15.592
Captains have to balance what's
moral and what's practical.

34:15.626 --> 34:17.404
Sometimes that means
making the toughest calls.

34:17.428 --> 34:19.106
Now, I understand
why you made the decision

34:19.130 --> 34:21.563
to ignore the mayday,
but I do not agree with it.

34:24.168 --> 34:26.235
See you at your panel interview.

34:38.829 --> 34:42.732
You suggest earlier that I
should go home, put my feet up.

34:42.766 --> 34:44.210
You know, I'm thinking I'll do just that.

34:44.235 --> 34:46.136
Go home, kick back.

34:46.170 --> 34:47.304
The game's on.

34:47.339 --> 34:49.539
Maybe I'll catch the end or something.

34:49.572 --> 34:51.574
You seem like you're feeling better, sir.

34:51.609 --> 34:54.043
Would you mind keeping
an ear out for the phone?

34:54.078 --> 34:56.913
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure thing.

34:56.947 --> 34:59.164
And, Miller?

34:59.750 --> 35:01.251
I'd prefer if you didn't say anything

35:01.285 --> 35:04.454
to anybody else about... earlier.

35:04.920 --> 35:08.258
If you feel better,
then I feel better, sir.

35:08.292 --> 35:10.126
Great.

35:14.965 --> 35:17.634
Nicely captained today, Montgomery.

35:17.668 --> 35:19.903
Turned out to be a tidy little call.

35:19.937 --> 35:22.172
You know, there is something
to being stuck somewhere

35:22.206 --> 35:24.007
that makes you honest with people.

35:24.041 --> 35:25.121
I'm honest with Montgomery.

35:25.152 --> 35:26.943
Whenever we're stuck in the Aid Car.

35:26.977 --> 35:28.121
Stop wearing so much damn cologne.

35:28.145 --> 35:31.514
Okay, now that we're back here
safely, I-I have to ask.

35:31.549 --> 35:34.017
What is the likelihood
of a pothole like that

35:34.051 --> 35:36.920
opening up and becoming
an actual sinkhole?

35:36.954 --> 35:38.955
What makes you think you're safe here?

35:39.579 --> 35:41.091
Okay, but, you know, at the call,

35:41.125 --> 35:43.460
you... you said that you were
certain it wouldn't happen.

35:43.494 --> 35:44.928
Defense mechanism.

35:44.962 --> 35:46.996
- Total bravado.
- It's true.

35:47.031 --> 35:50.633
You never know when a disaster
like that is lying in wait.

35:50.668 --> 35:54.037
Ready to suddenly, shockingly open up

35:54.071 --> 35:55.138
and swallow us whole.

35:55.172 --> 35:57.006
I think I'm scared of fire.

36:00.911 --> 36:02.946
- What is she talking about?
- I don't know.

36:02.980 --> 36:04.814
I think she's being hyperbolic.

36:04.849 --> 36:07.357
No, she's not.

36:10.221 --> 36:11.528
Go on.

36:14.225 --> 36:18.628
I don't... I don't have
a lot of people I'd call family.

36:19.897 --> 36:21.464
Especially not around here.

36:21.499 --> 36:23.293
I mean, y'all are it, basically.

36:23.327 --> 36:25.468
Vic, what's the matter?

36:29.612 --> 36:31.546
I have a problem.

36:35.051 --> 36:37.387
I've been trying
to work through it on my own.

36:38.430 --> 36:40.216
Willing it to go away because I know...

36:40.251 --> 36:42.185
I know it's this disaster lying in wait.

36:42.219 --> 36:44.187
And I don't know how you guys will react.

36:46.557 --> 36:49.092
And I-I don't know
if this means I'm gonna have

36:49.126 --> 36:50.650
to say goodbye to my family,

36:52.630 --> 36:53.897
when I don't want that.

36:53.931 --> 36:55.865
I don't want to say goodbye to you guys.

36:55.900 --> 36:58.074
But I don't think I can...

36:59.701 --> 37:01.838
I don't think I can hold this in anymore,

37:01.872 --> 37:03.371
and I don't think I should.

37:04.208 --> 37:05.582
I need to be honest.

37:06.750 --> 37:11.080
What do you mean when you
say you're afraid of fire?

37:13.484 --> 37:18.354
Ever Si... Ever since the tanker
with the blue fire, I just...

37:19.557 --> 37:22.258
I've started to... to flinch.

37:22.293 --> 37:24.460
Every time I get near a flame, I stop.

37:24.495 --> 37:25.769
I...

37:26.564 --> 37:29.933
That flash on the roof
nearly gave me a heart attack.

37:31.566 --> 37:33.234
I stop.

37:33.971 --> 37:36.072
I freeze up. I can't...

37:38.309 --> 37:40.376
It takes every ounce of self-control

37:40.411 --> 37:42.612
not to run in the opposite direction.

37:50.919 --> 37:53.656
Kind of the opposite
of what you want to do.

37:53.691 --> 37:55.325
When you're a firefighter.

37:55.359 --> 37:56.726
I know.

37:59.930 --> 38:02.599
This has been going on for weeks?

38:02.633 --> 38:04.300
Yes.

38:04.335 --> 38:07.337
Numerous calls, numerous shifts.

38:07.371 --> 38:09.138
Not a word. Nothing.

38:09.173 --> 38:12.440
Look, I s... Like I said, I've been...

38:13.310 --> 38:17.380
I've been trying to work on it on my own.

38:22.887 --> 38:26.522
We're not gonna let somebody
else come in and take over.

38:26.557 --> 38:28.289
I'm still in this.

38:29.332 --> 38:31.294
I'll win 19 for the both
of us if I have to.

38:31.328 --> 38:33.711
I can't talk about this right now.

38:49.144 --> 38:52.148
Thank you, Vic,

38:52.182 --> 38:53.650
for being honest with us.

38:56.153 --> 38:58.788
I think we all know
what we need to do next.

39:06.597 --> 39:09.399
Okay, I'll tell Herrera
and Gibson when they get back.

39:09.433 --> 39:11.166
No.

39:12.169 --> 39:13.903
We don't say a word to them.

39:13.938 --> 39:15.638
They'll have to report you.

39:17.508 --> 39:20.550
We keep you in the Aid Car
for the time being.

39:21.593 --> 39:23.146
And when we can't do that,

39:23.180 --> 39:27.182
we can all make sure that
you're on pump or hydrant

39:27.952 --> 39:29.552
until you're ready to go back in.

39:31.355 --> 39:34.190
I know a guy at the training tower.

39:34.224 --> 39:35.925
We can run simulations on our days off.

39:35.960 --> 39:37.904
Yeah, I know some drills
we can try out here, too.

39:37.928 --> 39:40.863
Hypnosis worked for a guy
at my old station.

39:40.898 --> 39:42.665
I'll... I'll help with anything.

39:42.700 --> 39:45.101
You want cover, you just
tell 'em I'm hopeless

39:45.135 --> 39:46.269
and you're training me.

39:46.303 --> 39:49.572
Well, that's not... That's not
much of a stretch, so...

39:54.645 --> 39:56.127
Thank you.

39:56.780 --> 39:58.881
Thanks, you guys, for doing this.

39:58.916 --> 40:00.260
Yeah, like you said, we're family.

40:00.284 --> 40:02.719
- You'd do it for us.
- Right.

40:02.753 --> 40:05.054
Now, the question is...

40:05.089 --> 40:07.223
Come here.

40:07.257 --> 40:09.025
What will you do for the rest of us?

40:09.059 --> 40:10.426
Okay.

40:10.461 --> 40:11.538
- Don't start with the laundry again.
- What?

40:11.562 --> 40:14.263
- That ship has sailed.
- But my shirts, they shrink.

40:14.298 --> 40:16.632
You know you do that on purpose
to tighten your sleeves.

40:16.667 --> 40:18.034
- Yeah.
- We know you do that.

40:18.068 --> 40:20.370
O-Okay, don't hate.

40:20.404 --> 40:23.072
- Appreciate.
- You said you hated my cologne!

40:23.107 --> 40:24.117
I can't believe you said that!

40:24.141 --> 40:25.652
- It's terrible.
- It is a little overwhelming.

40:25.676 --> 40:27.577
The thing we sometimes forget is,

40:27.611 --> 40:29.712
there's real strength in numbers.

40:33.517 --> 40:35.385
Hey.

40:35.419 --> 40:37.286
I was just stopping by
to see how things went.

40:37.321 --> 40:39.822
Your dad must be asleep.
He didn't answer.

40:39.857 --> 40:41.557
You're just getting back?

40:41.592 --> 40:43.493
Long day.

40:43.527 --> 40:45.128
How'd it go?

40:45.162 --> 40:47.845
Thanks for this.

40:48.432 --> 40:51.234
- Did it work?
- Yeah, I don't think so.

40:51.268 --> 40:52.969
Things didn't go well today.

40:53.003 --> 40:54.114
I don't believe for a minute

40:54.138 --> 40:55.171
that you didn't kick ass.

40:55.205 --> 40:57.146
I didn't say I didn't kick ass.

40:57.775 --> 41:00.309
But, still, it...
it didn't go well today.

41:00.344 --> 41:02.845
Want me to stay to talk about it or...

41:02.880 --> 41:05.481
We don't have to go it alone
if we don't want to.

41:05.516 --> 41:06.990
Thank you, but...

41:07.551 --> 41:10.620
I think my dad's the person
I need to talk to right now.

41:12.990 --> 41:14.791
Okay.

41:14.825 --> 41:16.825
If you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

41:26.003 --> 41:28.337
There's value in reaching out.

41:28.372 --> 41:30.106
Dad, you were right.

41:30.140 --> 41:32.708
The Incinerator was brutal.

41:32.743 --> 41:35.812
Do you know who was there? Chief Ripley.

41:35.846 --> 41:38.688
There's hope in asking for help.

41:39.383 --> 41:41.065
Dad, are you up?

41:42.519 --> 41:44.020
Dad?

41:46.690 --> 41:50.126
So reach out. Open up. Be honest.

41:50.160 --> 41:53.463
Trust your team to get you out
of that burning building,

41:53.497 --> 41:55.665
even if you can't see
the way out yourself.

41:55.699 --> 41:57.667
Because one thing's for sure.

41:57.701 --> 41:58.801
Hello.

41:58.836 --> 42:03.473
I, need you to page
Dr. Miranda Bailey, please.

42:03.507 --> 42:04.707
I'm her patient.

42:10.881 --> 42:12.415
You can't do it alone.
