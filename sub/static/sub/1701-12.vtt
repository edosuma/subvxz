WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:11.635
Can't get the monkey off your back?

00:12.929 --> 00:15.180
Then put it in your mouth...

00:15.390 --> 00:17.266
...with Monkeyshine Beer!

00:20.770 --> 00:22.104
Wow.

00:26.609 --> 00:27.985
Monkeyshine Beer.

00:28.153 --> 00:30.487
Because it's a jungle out there!

00:31.156 --> 00:33.282
That commercial always
makes me so sad.

00:33.491 --> 00:36.702
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer
and girls run at him...

00:36.953 --> 00:38.912
...so everything works out okay.

00:39.456 --> 00:42.332
I meant because the monkey in it
reminds me of Marcel.

00:42.584 --> 00:43.709
I can see that.

00:43.918 --> 00:48.505
Because they both have those big
brown eyes and the little pouty chin.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.383
And the fact that
they're both monkeys?

00:52.302 --> 00:54.970
I wonder if I did the right thing,
giving him away.

00:55.180 --> 00:59.475
Ross, you had to. He was
humping everything in sight.

00:59.684 --> 01:03.562
I mean, I have a Malibu Barbie who will
no longer be wearing white to her wedding.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.400
Remember when he'd borrow your hat...

01:08.610 --> 01:12.362
...and when you got it back,
there'd be little monkey raisins in it?

01:13.073 --> 01:16.825
When he did it, it was funny.
When I did it to my boss's hat...

01:18.078 --> 01:21.455
All of a sudden, I had
this big "attitude problem."

02:10.755 --> 02:11.839
Hey. Hey.

02:12.006 --> 02:14.675
- Check it out! Guess what I got?
- Rhythm?

02:15.718 --> 02:17.886
No. My first fan mail!

02:18.054 --> 02:19.471
Check it out.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.473
"Dear Dr. Ramoray:

02:21.641 --> 02:24.810
Know that I love you and
would do anything to have you."

02:24.978 --> 02:28.021
My gosh! "Your not-so-secret
admirer, Erika Ford."

02:29.566 --> 02:30.732
Oh, wait.

02:30.900 --> 02:35.404
"P.S. Enclosed, please find
14 of my eyelashes."

02:36.781 --> 02:39.992
You know, in Crazy World,
that means you're married.

02:42.453 --> 02:45.873
It's not addressed to Days Of Our Lives.
This came to your apartment.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.667
There's no stamp on it.
This woman was in our building.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.252
Oh, my God.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.005
I got my very own stalker!

02:55.466 --> 02:56.675
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.177
- Hey.
- Ooh.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.428
Where are you off to?

02:59.596 --> 03:02.306
There's this paleontology
conference in L.A.

03:02.515 --> 03:06.560
So I figured I'd go and drive down
to the zoo and surprise Marcel.

03:06.769 --> 03:10.105
I think he will be surprised.
Till he realizes he's a monkey...

03:11.816 --> 03:14.484
...and, uh, you know,
isn't capable of that emotion.

03:16.112 --> 03:19.281
Oh, Phoebe? That really cute guy
is here again.

03:19.490 --> 03:20.574
Oh? Oh.

03:20.742 --> 03:21.909
Okay, so everyone, ahem...

03:22.118 --> 03:25.454
...pretend I'm telling you a story
and it's really funny.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.039
So everyone just laugh. Now!

03:29.667 --> 03:31.501
I know, I know! Oh.

03:31.669 --> 03:32.920
- Hello.
- Hi.

03:33.087 --> 03:34.463
Oh.

03:34.672 --> 03:35.839
I'm Rob Donan.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.132
Hi, Rob Donan.

03:37.300 --> 03:41.595
I don't know anything about music,
but I think you're really great.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.431
Oh, wow. Ha, ha.

03:44.599 --> 03:48.393
Anyway, I schedule performers
for children's libraries.

03:48.561 --> 03:53.315
And I was thinking, have you thought
about playing your songs for kids?

03:53.483 --> 03:55.108
Oh, I would love to have kids...

03:58.488 --> 04:02.366
...hear me play the songs
that I will write for them.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.620
What do you wanna do for dinner?

04:06.829 --> 04:08.830
We could stay in and cook for ourselves.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.922
- Hello.
- It's Erika.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.839
Oh, my God. The stalker!

04:19.007 --> 04:20.259
Never mind. It's open.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.302
Aah! Aah!

04:22.720 --> 04:25.347
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan
is a good idea.

04:25.515 --> 04:29.351
We might wanna have a backup plan,
though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.187
Let's get out of here!

04:35.275 --> 04:36.858
The one time they're not home!

04:37.026 --> 04:38.694
Okay. Okay.

04:39.153 --> 04:40.779
We'll leave.
When we pass her...

04:40.947 --> 04:43.699
...she won't know me,
because we never met!

04:45.535 --> 04:47.703
That's how radio stars
escape stalkers!

04:49.706 --> 04:51.206
She's coming!

04:57.130 --> 04:58.297
- It's me.
- Aah!

04:58.464 --> 05:02.092
Uh, this is it.
This is how we're gonna die.

05:03.678 --> 05:06.054
- You ready?
- Wait, wait, wait!

05:13.104 --> 05:14.563
Hi.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.690
Erika!

05:25.992 --> 05:27.534
- Mr. Geller?
- Yes, hi.

05:27.785 --> 05:30.495
Hi. Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.456
I was told you had a question.

05:32.623 --> 05:37.336
I, uh... I can't find the monkey I donated
last year. He's a capuchin...

05:37.503 --> 05:39.129
...answers to the name Marcel?

05:39.339 --> 05:42.924
Ah. I'm afraid I have some bad news.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.594
Marcel has passed on.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.931
Oh, my God. What happened?

05:50.099 --> 05:52.726
Well, he got sick,
and then he got sicker...

05:52.977 --> 05:54.978
...and then he got a little better.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.147
But then he died.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.109
I can't believe this!

06:01.319 --> 06:06.114
I'm sorry, Mr. Geller.
But you know, there's an old saying:

06:06.282 --> 06:08.950
"Sometimes monkeys die."

06:10.536 --> 06:12.954
It's not a great saying...

06:14.040 --> 06:16.333
...but it certainly is fitting today.

06:16.542 --> 06:19.461
- Someone should've called me.
- I'm sorry.

06:19.629 --> 06:22.089
Look, I know this can't
bring him back...

06:22.256 --> 06:24.716
...but here, it's just a gesture.

06:26.594 --> 06:27.844
Zoo dollars?

06:28.012 --> 06:32.349
Yes, and come see the bird show
at 4. The macaws wear hats.

06:33.851 --> 06:37.020
Well, it's a lot cuter
if your monkey hasn't just died.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.069
Ooh.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.779
I know.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.950
I can't believe Joey's having
lunch with his stalker.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.701
What is she like?

06:51.869 --> 06:54.371
- Well, you remember Kathy Bates in Misery?
Mm-hm.

06:54.539 --> 06:57.707
Well, she looks
the exact opposite of that.

06:58.793 --> 06:59.918
And she's not crazy?

07:00.086 --> 07:02.712
Oh, no, no.
She's a total wack job.

07:02.880 --> 07:07.676
Yeah. She thinks that Joey is
actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.261
Oh, my God!

07:09.429 --> 07:11.555
Oh. And he's going out with her?

07:11.764 --> 07:13.432
He cannot pursue this.

07:13.599 --> 07:17.269
Just because this woman thinks she can
see Joey through the magical box...

07:17.437 --> 07:20.021
...in her living room
doesn't mean she's not a person.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.650
Does she not deserve happiness?
Does she not deserve love?

07:24.694 --> 07:28.947
What are you looking at me for?
He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.116
Are you okay?

07:31.284 --> 07:33.452
No, uh-uh. I'm just nervous.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.955
Maybe if I just picture them all
in their underwear...

07:37.123 --> 07:40.083
That's not a good idea. That's
the reason the last guy got fired.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.710
Oh.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.130
Yeah.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.591
I'm used to playing for grownups.

07:47.758 --> 07:51.303
Grownups drink their coffee
and do their grownup thing, you know.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.596
And kids...

07:52.763 --> 07:54.055
...listen.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.059
It's just a huge responsibility.

07:58.227 --> 07:59.394
What?

07:59.562 --> 08:01.480
Are you gonna kiss me?

08:02.773 --> 08:03.940
I was thinking about it.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.485
Okay.

08:08.946 --> 08:11.615
Yeah, okay. Alrighty. Let's play some tunes!

08:14.660 --> 08:15.952
Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.497
Hi, Phoebe!

08:18.706 --> 08:20.999
Ha, ha. Okay. Um...

08:21.292 --> 08:25.212
...I'm gonna play, um, some songs
about grandparents, okay?

08:27.590 --> 08:30.926
Now Grandma's a person
Who everyone likes

08:31.093 --> 08:34.179
She bought you a train
And a bright shiny bike

08:34.347 --> 08:37.432
But lately she hasn't
Been coming to dinner

08:37.600 --> 08:40.936
And last time you saw her
She looked so much thinner

08:41.979 --> 08:45.482
Now your mom and your dad said
She moved to Peru

08:45.650 --> 08:48.985
But the truth is she died
And someday you will too

08:49.153 --> 08:58.161
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la

08:59.997 --> 09:02.916
- Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
- Yeah, it is.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.253
What?

09:07.004 --> 09:09.714
Well, here we sit, devil-may-care...

09:09.882 --> 09:14.302
...and just a little while ago you were
reattaching Simone's spinal cord.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.804
Yeah, that was a tricky one.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.723
In reality...

09:18.891 --> 09:23.061
...that operation takes over 10 hours,
but they only showed it for two minutes.

09:23.771 --> 09:24.854
Who's "they"?

09:27.316 --> 09:28.400
No one.

09:30.278 --> 09:34.656
Oh, Drake, you are so talented.
Let me see those hands.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.284
- Oh, these hands, these beautiful hands.
- Ha, ha.

09:37.493 --> 09:40.245
Ha, ha. Oh, I could just eat them.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.746
- But I won't.
- Ha, ha.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.124
Good.
Otherwise my watch would fall off.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.007
No, seriously.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.676
These hands...

09:54.844 --> 09:57.429
...these miracle, magical,
life-giving hands.

09:57.680 --> 10:01.725
Oh, just to be near them, touch them,
maybe even lick one?

10:02.893 --> 10:05.270
- All right. Ha, ha. Just one.
- Ha-ha-ha.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.154
Wow.

10:14.655 --> 10:15.739
You're good at that.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.327
Oh, my God! Someone!
He's choking!

10:20.494 --> 10:22.579
Is anyone here a doctor?

10:22.747 --> 10:23.830
Oh, yes.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.832
Yes, the best doctor in Salem!

10:26.000 --> 10:28.126
Dr. Drake Ramoray!

10:43.267 --> 10:47.604
Meet me in the nocturnal
house in 15 minutes.

10:49.565 --> 10:54.903
Uh, hey, look. I don't really enjoy
being with other men that way.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.947
But, um, zoo dollars?

10:59.116 --> 11:01.576
It's about your monkey.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.745
It's alive.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.127
I don't understand.
Why didn't you help that man?

11:11.295 --> 11:14.631
Uh, because, uh,
I'm a neurosurgeon...

11:14.799 --> 11:18.718
...and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh...

11:18.886 --> 11:20.095
..."foodal chokage."

11:21.764 --> 11:22.847
You know.

11:25.059 --> 11:28.061
- I gotta tell you something...
- No, no, no.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.105
You don't have to tell me anything.

11:30.272 --> 11:32.649
You don't have
to explain yourself to me. Oh!

11:32.858 --> 11:35.944
Who am I to question
the great Dr. Drake Ramoray?

11:36.112 --> 11:38.196
- That's...
- I should be happy to be near you.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.489
Hey, I...

11:43.369 --> 11:44.911
"Hey" what?

11:45.079 --> 11:47.497
That's it. Just hey!

11:48.207 --> 11:50.625
Like at the end of a dance. Hey!

11:53.295 --> 11:55.255
Hey. Ha-ha-ha.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.340
Hey.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.218
There'll be times when you get older

12:00.386 --> 12:02.053
When you'll want to sleep with people

12:02.221 --> 12:05.515
Just to make them like you
But don't

12:06.767 --> 12:07.851
'Cause

12:08.018 --> 12:11.479
That's another thing
That you don't wanna do

12:11.647 --> 12:12.647
Everybody!

12:12.815 --> 12:17.694
That's another thing
That you don't wanna do

12:19.113 --> 12:21.030
- Excellent!
- Very informative!

12:21.198 --> 12:24.033
Not at all inappropriate!

12:24.201 --> 12:28.163
Thank you for coming, everybody.
There are cookies in the back.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.082
That was great.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.500
The kids loved you.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.254
Yay! I rock!

12:36.422 --> 12:39.340
And you know why?
Because you told the truth.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.676
Nobody ever tells kids the truth.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.553
You were incredible!

12:43.971 --> 12:45.889
Ha, ha. But?

12:46.432 --> 12:49.809
- How did you know there was a "but"?
- I sense these things.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.145
It was either "but" or "butter."

12:54.023 --> 12:56.357
The thing is, I think
some of the parents...

12:56.525 --> 12:58.234
...they were hoping that...

12:58.402 --> 13:01.362
...you'd play more songs
about barnyard animals.

13:01.530 --> 13:02.822
I can do that.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.115
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.577
- Because that would be fantastic.
- Oh.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.705
What? You wanna kiss me?

13:10.873 --> 13:12.582
I'm thinking about it.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.586
Ah, the bat.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.297
Ambassador of darkness.

13:19.465 --> 13:23.593
Flitting out of his cave
like a winged messenger.

13:23.761 --> 13:27.263
Sightless specter of the macabre.

13:28.432 --> 13:29.766
Buddy, my monkey?

13:30.518 --> 13:31.935
Oh, yeah, right.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.896
There was a break-in...

13:35.064 --> 13:37.857
...a few months back. Inside job.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.359
Your monkey was taken.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.945
Oh, my God. The zoo told me
that my monkey was dead.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.113
Pfft. The zoo!

13:44.281 --> 13:46.825
You believe everything
the zoo tells you?

13:49.286 --> 13:52.831
Uh, that's the only thing
the zoo's ever told me.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.376
Of course they'll say he's dead.
They don't want the bad publicity.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.002
It's all a great big cover-up.

13:58.170 --> 14:02.090
Do you have any idea
how high up this thing goes?

14:02.299 --> 14:04.008
That guy Lipson?

14:04.468 --> 14:06.094
Lipson knows?

14:06.762 --> 14:07.846
Hmm.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.639
Lipson knows, huh?

14:09.807 --> 14:12.058
Ah, hello, Mr. Possum.

14:12.268 --> 14:16.020
Enigma of the trees,
upside-down denizen of the night.

14:16.188 --> 14:19.315
- Taunting gravity...
- Buddy, my monkey. My monkey?

14:21.110 --> 14:23.027
Word on the street...

14:23.195 --> 14:27.532
Well, when I say "street," I mean
those little pretend streets here at the zoo.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.117
Of course.

14:30.911 --> 14:33.454
Your monkey found a new career...

14:33.622 --> 14:37.041
...in the entertainment field.
That's all I know.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.919
This is unbelievable!

14:40.087 --> 14:45.049
So, what is this information
worth to you, my friend?

14:45.759 --> 14:48.595
Are you trying
to get me to bribe you?

14:48.762 --> 14:50.305
Maybe.

14:51.473 --> 14:54.183
But you already told me everything.

15:01.942 --> 15:05.612
Check it out. He actually is
the Monkeyshine monkey.

15:05.779 --> 15:07.822
Oh, wow. So, what are you gonna do?

15:07.990 --> 15:11.326
I'm gonna call the beer company
and try to find out where he is.

15:11.493 --> 15:14.454
That's what I did
when I lost my Clydesdales.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.998
Okay, hi again!

15:17.166 --> 15:19.876
Hi, Phoebe!

15:20.794 --> 15:24.672
Today, we're gonna start with
some songs about barnyard animals.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.635
Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"

15:28.802 --> 15:30.845
Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"

15:31.013 --> 15:33.514
Then the farmer hits him on the head
And grinds him up

15:33.682 --> 15:35.808
And that's how we get hamburgers

15:38.729 --> 15:42.065
Now chickens

15:43.359 --> 15:45.401
You're the only one who can save her, Drake!

15:45.653 --> 15:48.321
Damn it! I'm a doctor, I'm not God!

15:48.489 --> 15:50.615
Well, there goes my whole belief system.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.160
It's Erika.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.870
Quick! Quick. Shut off the TV.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.956
Wait, I wanna see what happens!

15:58.123 --> 16:00.500
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma
then we make out.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.961
How can that be?
You were just kissing Sabrina.

16:03.128 --> 16:07.090
Rachel, it's a world
where Joey is a neurosurgeon.

16:10.511 --> 16:11.928
Hey, Erika. Come in.

16:12.137 --> 16:15.390
How did you get here so fast?
I just saw you in Salem.

16:15.683 --> 16:18.726
Right, they, uh, choppered me in.
Ha, ha.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.353
What's up?

16:20.521 --> 16:22.605
Oh, you're having a little party too.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.149
- Is she here, huh, huh?
- Who?

16:25.317 --> 16:27.485
Sabrina. I know about you two!

16:27.653 --> 16:30.822
I saw you today, kissing
in the doctor's lounge.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.075
It's not what you think.
That was...

16:34.243 --> 16:36.327
You told me I was the only one!

16:40.791 --> 16:42.208
All right, look. That's it.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.419
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.546
I should have told you
a long time ago...

16:46.714 --> 16:49.382
...but I am not Drake Ramoray, okay?

16:49.550 --> 16:53.302
I'm not even a doctor. I'm an actor.
I just pretend to be a doctor.

16:53.470 --> 16:56.723
Oh, my God. Do the people
at the hospital know about this?

16:59.727 --> 17:02.395
Ha, ha.
Somebody wanna help me out here?

17:02.563 --> 17:04.896
Oh, I know! I know!

17:05.441 --> 17:06.733
Where am I?

17:06.983 --> 17:08.608
University Hospital...

17:08.777 --> 17:11.445
...the same place you've been
for the last 18 years.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.615
How can you be here and there?

17:14.782 --> 17:16.909
Ha, ha.
Because it's a television show.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.369
Drake, what are you getting at?

17:21.540 --> 17:23.207
I'm not Drake!

17:23.375 --> 17:26.294
That's right. He's not Drake. He's...

17:26.962 --> 17:29.255
...Hans Ramoray, Drake's evil twin!

17:34.720 --> 17:35.887
Is this true?

17:37.056 --> 17:39.223
Yes! Yes, it is true.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.225
And I know this...

17:41.393 --> 17:44.812
...because he pretended
to be Drake to sleep with me!

17:51.070 --> 17:53.863
And then he told me
he would run away with me.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.448
And he didn't!

17:57.493 --> 17:59.827
And you left the toilet seat up,
you bastard!

18:05.959 --> 18:07.335
Is all this true?

18:10.923 --> 18:14.425
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.761
You deserve much better than me, Erika.

18:16.929 --> 18:21.474
You deserve to be with the real Drake.
He's the one you fell in love with.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.935
Go to Salem. Find him!

18:24.103 --> 18:26.145
He's the guy for you.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.897
Oh, Hans.

18:30.859 --> 18:31.943
Hans?

18:32.111 --> 18:33.903
Hans!

18:34.696 --> 18:36.697
Yo, evil twin!

18:37.116 --> 18:39.450
Right. Uh, goodbye, Erika.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.203
Good luck in Salem.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.206
Take care.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.000
I'll never forget you, Hans.

18:52.756 --> 18:55.007
Ha, ha. All right.
The people who threw the water!

18:55.175 --> 18:56.717
Helping you out!

18:56.927 --> 19:00.054
Fired? Why?

19:00.222 --> 19:03.307
The library board has had
a lot of complaints from parents...

19:03.475 --> 19:06.435
...about some of the stuff in your songs.
- I can't believe it!

19:06.603 --> 19:10.606
Did you tell your board about how
the kids want to hear the truth?

19:11.817 --> 19:13.442
No.

19:15.737 --> 19:16.946
I see.

19:17.114 --> 19:21.075
Maybe if you just played
some regular kiddie songs?

19:21.243 --> 19:22.577
No.

19:22.744 --> 19:24.704
What do you want me to be?
Like some...

19:24.872 --> 19:28.916
...stupid, big,
like, purple dinosaur?

19:29.376 --> 19:30.918
You don't have to be Barney.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.171
- Who's Barney?
- Eh...

19:37.968 --> 19:41.554
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this:
He's healthy, he's happy...

19:41.763 --> 19:45.766
...and he's here in New York filming
Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.143
You're kidding!

19:47.311 --> 19:49.353
- This is amazing.
- I know.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.982
I finally get a part on TV,
and the monkey's making movies.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.152
Okay. Rachel, I'm ready.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.403
Okay.

20:00.741 --> 20:04.285
Excuse me. Is this where the
singing lady is who tells the truth?

20:05.078 --> 20:07.455
Um, yeah, I guess that's me.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.291
She's here!

20:19.218 --> 20:21.594
Sometimes men love women

20:21.762 --> 20:24.430
And sometimes men love men

20:24.598 --> 20:27.058
And then there are bisexuals

20:27.226 --> 20:30.311
Though some just say
They're kidding themselves

20:31.855 --> 20:34.607
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

20:34.775 --> 20:37.777
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la

20:40.489 --> 20:43.032
This is exciting. I haven't
seen my monkey in a year.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.701
What, you never
look down in the shower?

20:46.536 --> 20:50.665
Oh, please. I'm not allowed to make
one joke in the "monkey is penis" genre?

20:51.250 --> 20:52.500
Back up, please.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.210
Back up. Come on, come on.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.004
Excuse me.
Uh, where can we find the monkey?

20:57.172 --> 20:58.673
I'm sorry. It's a closed set.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.884
I'm sorry, you don't understand.
I'm a friend of his.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.387
We, uh, used to live together.

21:04.554 --> 21:07.807
Yeah. And I have a timeshare
in the Poconos with Flipper.

21:10.727 --> 21:11.811
Ross, there he is!

21:12.396 --> 21:14.188
Hey! Hey, buddy!

21:14.356 --> 21:16.983
Marcel! Marcel!

21:23.490 --> 21:29.829
In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The lion sleeps tonight

21:32.833 --> 21:39.630
In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The lion sleeps tonight

22:07.326 --> 22:10.619
They won't take you to the vet

22:10.829 --> 22:14.332
You're obviously not
Their favorite pet

22:14.624 --> 22:18.169
- Smelly cat, smelly cat
- Smelly cat, smelly cat

22:18.462 --> 22:21.630
- It's not your fault
- It's not your fault

22:21.840 --> 22:26.218
No

22:26.678 --> 22:28.346
- Ha-ha-ha. I'm sorry.
- What?

22:28.722 --> 22:29.805
What's wrong with that?

22:30.140 --> 22:34.226
Um, ahem, I think you might wanna,
like, pick a more masculine note. Heh.
