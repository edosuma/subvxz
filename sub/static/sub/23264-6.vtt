- Five years.

00:03.940 --> 00:05.820
- Bring me the flash drive.
- I haven't got it.

00:05.820 --> 00:07.380
Renko took it. It's gone.

00:07.380 --> 00:08.660
- They cut her a deal.

00:08.660 --> 00:11.300
If she can bring you down, then her
child stays out of prison.

00:11.300 --> 00:12.740
- So, what is taking so long?

00:12.740 --> 00:14.940
- There's nothing to suggest that
Hicks killed Butler.

00:14.940 --> 00:16.460
- He's sleeping with the man's wife.

00:16.460 --> 00:18.660

it, because we can't,

killed Butler.

00:30.780 --> 00:31.940
He's innocent.

00:36.300 --> 00:38.540
- Elaine, I... I thought you knew.

- Knew what, Charlie?

00:39.980 --> 00:41.300
