00:11.112 --> 00:13.512
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:17.485 --> 00:20.519
Bomb threats--
what a crock.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.222
How you figure?

00:23.224 --> 00:25.190
In the middle
of the winter?

00:25.192 --> 00:27.393
Probably took the first
snowbird special

00:27.395 --> 00:30.229
down to Miami,
like anybody else

00:30.231 --> 00:32.598
with a couple of brain cells
to rub together.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.133
(<i> blows nose loudly</i> )

00:34.135 --> 00:36.368
I happen to like winter.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.371
Yeah, well,
you happen to be nuts.

00:39.373 --> 00:43.609
Enjoy it all you want, pal.

00:43.611 --> 00:46.178
I'm going to go
roast these pecans.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.579
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

00:50.518 --> 00:52.251
Help!
Oh, my God. Help them!

00:52.253 --> 00:53.619
My parents--

00:53.621 --> 00:55.220
they've been shot.

00:59.226 --> 01:02.127
My first thought was,
it was a diversion--

01:02.129 --> 01:04.663
you know,
because of the bomb threats.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.498
His name's Greg Jarmon.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.667
We called his brother.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.337
Stay with him.

01:12.339 --> 01:14.573
Write down
anything he says.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.433
Hey, Max, Mike--
Evelyn Jarmon.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.469
Two shots from right here.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.104
There's more.

01:49.577 --> 01:52.277
Karl Jarmon.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.546
Three at close range.

01:56.584 --> 01:57.883
Let me guess.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.618
No signs of burglary.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.453
Alarm was still on.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.156
Kid tripped it
when he came in.

02:04.158 --> 02:06.592
No shells,
but check out the study.

02:06.594 --> 02:10.729
Italian, Czech, English--
best money can buy, right?

02:10.731 --> 02:15.334
This one has been fired.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.336
Run it through the lab.

02:17.338 --> 02:20.339
You never figure
you're going to get it

02:20.341 --> 02:22.608
from your
own gun.

02:24.345 --> 02:27.546
Detective,
double-aught buck.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.183
Five missing.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.724
Jarmon and sons, last fall.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.428
The family
that kills together...

   Captioning sponsored by
   NBC/UNIVERSAL

04:16.290 --> 04:20.259
I just...
I came home and found them.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.593
GREEVEY:
Where were you?

04:21.595 --> 04:24.329
At the Garden--
a Rangers game.

04:24.331 --> 04:25.530
By yourself?

04:25.532 --> 04:27.532
No. My brother Nick
picked me up.

04:27.534 --> 04:31.436
When I came home,
I walked in, and...

04:31.438 --> 04:34.339
and I saw Mom.

04:34.341 --> 04:35.741
MAN:
Greg!

04:43.484 --> 04:45.450
Where's mom?

04:45.452 --> 04:46.585
I'm Nick Jarmon.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.053
Where's my mother?

04:51.792 --> 04:53.458
No.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.862
She wasn't supposed
to be home.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.564
Do you know where she was
supposed to be, Nick?

04:59.566 --> 05:02.534
A benefit at the Met.

05:02.536 --> 05:05.337
She wasn't supposed
to be home.

05:07.641 --> 05:11.376
(<i> sobbing</i> )

05:13.747 --> 05:15.547
What did your father do?

05:15.549 --> 05:17.049
Printing.

05:17.051 --> 05:18.684
He owns...

05:18.686 --> 05:20.852
owned a printing company.

05:20.854 --> 05:24.656
Greg said you guys went
to the Ranger game.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.693
Dad... the company
has season tickets.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.661
Just so I get it straight.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.698
Greg picked you up
to go to the game...

05:32.700 --> 05:35.834
No, I went up to the house
around 7:00.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.537
We took a cab to the game.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.605
Did you see
your parents?

05:42.543 --> 05:44.109
I didn't go in.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.911
No?

05:45.913 --> 05:48.780
You had dinner at the game?

05:48.782 --> 05:51.550
Later, at Chelsea Central.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.518
Then I went home.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.620
We went to Chelsea Central.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.789
I think I left
my scarf there.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.558
Don't worry about it.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.626
What time did you get home?

06:01.628 --> 06:03.395
I'm not sure.

06:03.397 --> 06:06.098
Uh... 11:30.

06:06.100 --> 06:10.569
So, you met Nick
at the Garden, right?

06:10.571 --> 06:13.105
No, I told you,
he came over to the house.

06:13.107 --> 06:14.539
Okay.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.808
Listen, did your father
have any enemies?

06:16.810 --> 06:19.711
Did he ever talk
about any troubles

06:19.713 --> 06:21.113
he might have had?

06:21.115 --> 06:23.582
We didn't really
pay attention.

06:23.584 --> 06:26.818
Mom-- everybody loved her.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.421
One last thing
before you go.

06:29.423 --> 06:32.424
We'd like you to take
a paraffin test.

06:32.426 --> 06:33.825
What's that?

06:33.827 --> 06:37.696
A test to see if gunpowder
residue is on your hands.

06:37.698 --> 06:38.964
Wait a minute.
You don't think..?

06:38.966 --> 06:40.966
It's standard procedure.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.701
You might as well know.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.803
There may be powder on my hands.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.539
This afternoon, on the island,
I went skeet shooting.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.908
Okay.
Mind taking the test anyway?

06:49.910 --> 06:52.411
Shouldn't he talk to a lawyer?

06:52.413 --> 06:54.679
Why? Do you think
you need a lawyer?

06:54.681 --> 06:56.448
No. No, I don't.

06:56.450 --> 06:59.184
Of course I'll take the test.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.454
You talk to the neighbors?

07:02.456 --> 07:06.425
On the right, people working on
their melanomas in Barbados.

07:06.427 --> 07:09.628
On the left, some old gummer
with her hearing aid turned off.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.547
Any further away

07:11.548 --> 07:13.465
most people can't tell
gunshots from belches.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.200
What about the kids?

07:15.202 --> 07:18.637
They're either innocent
or well-rehearsed.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.606
So, put them
through the wringer.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.543
LOGAN:
Listen, don't you think we're
jumping to conclusions here?

07:24.545 --> 07:26.645
I mean,
I hated my mother

07:26.647 --> 07:28.980
but I didn't aerate her
with double-aught buck.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.715
That case in La-La Land?

07:30.717 --> 07:33.552
Nine months, the Beverly hills
cops jerked around.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.587
It came right back to the kids.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.789
We all know, nine times
out of ten, in the house

07:37.791 --> 07:39.925
husbands kill wives,
wives kill husbands

07:39.927 --> 07:42.027
and kids kill
parents.

07:45.599 --> 07:49.634
M.E. says they were killed
between 7:00 and 9:00.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.504
So, they could have
left the house

07:52.506 --> 07:55.740
just after 7:00,
game starts at 7:35.

07:55.742 --> 07:58.743
Cab to the Garden--
What? 20 Minutes?

07:58.745 --> 08:01.580
You're saying
Nick comes over

08:01.582 --> 08:03.582
they grease mom and dad

08:03.584 --> 08:06.585
catch a cab,
go cheer the Rangers?

08:06.587 --> 08:08.687
Pretty cold.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.590
Uh, yeah.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.592
Just the two tickets?

08:13.594 --> 08:15.661
Thanks.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.729
Jarmon's secretary checked
the sign-up sheet

08:17.731 --> 08:19.631
for last night's game.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.533
Company has six seats.

08:21.535 --> 08:22.701
Rangers played Quebec.

08:22.703 --> 08:25.637
That's like playing
against an empty net.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.273
Maybe that's why
the only one who signed up

08:28.275 --> 08:30.142
was Greg Jarmon.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.010
I'm telling you, Max,
we should keep looking.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.713
We're going to...

08:34.715 --> 08:38.984
for season-ticket holders
around the Jarmon box.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.752
So were they there
for the face-off?

08:40.754 --> 08:42.237
I didn't notice.

08:42.238 --> 08:43.721
Did they stay
for the whole game?

08:43.724 --> 08:45.690
There might have been other
kids in the third period.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.692
People move around.
Cheapos to ring side.

08:47.694 --> 08:52.664
First two kids, how old? 19? 20?

08:52.666 --> 08:54.065
Give me a break.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.601
What is it with
you hockey fans?

08:56.603 --> 08:57.903
No got no
short-term memory?

08:57.905 --> 09:00.038
Hey, ask me how many penalties
the Rangers killed

09:00.040 --> 09:02.641
or how many shots Leetch made,
that I remember.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.543
I keep my eye on the puck.

09:10.851 --> 09:14.586
The powder in the barrel
has similar characteristics

09:14.588 --> 09:16.588
to the residue on the victims.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.656
Smokeless dense--

09:17.658 --> 09:19.858
the same as found
in the shells

09:19.860 --> 09:21.626
from Jarmon's desk.

09:21.628 --> 09:23.311
Come on, Hurley,
this ain't court.

09:23.312 --> 09:24.995
Are we looking at the
murder weapon or what?

09:24.998 --> 09:27.766
An attorney's opinion?
Inconclusive.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.000
My opinion? Yes.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.302
Prints?

09:30.304 --> 09:32.871
I got some good lifts
from the shotgun.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.873
I sent them to latent

09:34.875 --> 09:39.611
and they matched Karl Jarmon's
and one of the kids-- Gregory.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.680
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

09:43.617 --> 09:45.016
Oh, so Nick watched

09:45.018 --> 09:47.118
while Greg did
all the shooting?

09:47.120 --> 09:49.054
Maybe he wasn't
in the hunting party.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.622
Oh, I get it.

09:50.624 --> 09:53.091
Greg shot the folks
before Nick came over

09:53.093 --> 09:55.060
and Nick's
covering for him.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.629
He ain't heavy--
he's my brother.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.998
Even if the kid just
offed mom and dad?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.766
What do you want
from me, huh?

10:01.768 --> 10:02.834
The alibi is nothing.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.370
Nobody at the game
ever saw them leave.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.972
Wait a minute--
Chelsea Central
checked out.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.808
The waitress said they
were there till 11:00.

10:09.810 --> 10:13.845
There are still a lot
of hours unaccounted for.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.815
Let's talk to the housekeeper.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.751
Have you worked
for the family long

10:19.753 --> 10:20.719
Mrs. Langdon?

10:20.721 --> 10:22.053
22 Years.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.623
Ever since
Nicholas was born.

10:24.625 --> 10:28.760
Mrs. Jarmon too busy
to bring up her own kids?

10:28.762 --> 10:30.762
Oh, you're way
off target, Detective.

10:30.764 --> 10:33.732
She was devoted to them,
maybe too much so.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.668
She picked them up
every day after school.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.937
Everyone else
sent their nannies.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.739
How about Mr. Jarmon?

10:40.741 --> 10:43.708
He wasn't at home
as much as he wanted.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.745
He and his partner
were always at the plant.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.730
Partner?

10:48.731 --> 10:50.714
Nick told us his father
owned the company.

10:50.717 --> 10:51.850
He owned most of it.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.685
He made Mr. Petrovich
a partner

10:53.687 --> 10:55.954
a couple of years ago.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.757
How about
when he was home?

10:58.759 --> 11:02.694
He did the best he could
as a father.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.404
You got to love it.

11:12.406 --> 11:14.906
A college student,
young Turk on Wall Street.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.908
Couldn't cast
the part much better.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.177
Come on, Max, I know you don't
like trust-fund babies

11:19.179 --> 11:21.079
but we got no evidence
on these guys.

11:21.081 --> 11:24.015
Right, just Greg's fingerprints
on the murder weapon

11:24.017 --> 11:26.151
and powder residue on his hands.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.986
Could have used it hunting.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.789
The gun club confirms
he was out skeet shooting

11:30.791 --> 11:32.090
that afternoon.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.793
Yep,
and according to the housekeeper

11:34.795 --> 11:36.795
they were one happy family.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.731
Ozzie and Harriet on East 68th.

11:39.733 --> 11:42.000
Which leaves us
what for a motive?

11:42.002 --> 11:43.134
The papers say

11:43.136 --> 11:45.036
Jarmon was worth ten million?

11:45.038 --> 11:48.206
Maybe the kids wanted to hurry
up on their inheritance.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.009
Look, I don't care if he was
worth 50 million,

11:51.011 --> 11:53.778
if you love your parents, you
don't blow them away over money.

11:53.780 --> 11:56.281
Yeah? You ask me, I don't think
things were that great

11:56.283 --> 11:58.917
between the old man
and the kids.

11:58.919 --> 12:02.887
All I keep hearing is what
the housekeeper wasn't saying.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.156
What is this?<i> Siskel and Ebert?</i>

12:05.158 --> 12:07.892
Do me a favor, come up
with a motive for the boy

12:07.894 --> 12:11.830
and go talk to...
what's his name? The partner.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.904
Karl and me ran
this business together.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.506
We were like you.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.074
Good cop, bad cop.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.509
Which was which?

12:24.511 --> 12:27.812
Karl knew how to get
a nickel out of a penny.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.814
Drove suppliers crazy,
customers too.

12:29.815 --> 12:31.815
It was up to me to make
everybody happy again.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.521
What about the employees?

12:36.523 --> 12:38.490
He drive them
crazy, too?

12:38.492 --> 12:41.092
Karl wasn't no hand-holder.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.861
A man can make enemies
that way--

12:42.863 --> 12:44.195
maybe the kind
that'll kill you.

12:44.197 --> 12:47.766
Okay, Karl was a bastard.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.801
So find me a boss who isn't.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.537
He liked to kick
a little ass

12:52.539 --> 12:54.239
and yell a lot.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.040
Except when his jaw was broke.

12:56.042 --> 12:58.209
Oh, yeah?

12:58.211 --> 13:00.812
When did that happen?

13:00.814 --> 13:03.114
About a year and a half ago.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.115
LOGAN:
How?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.350
I don't know.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.886
He showed up at work
with his jaw wired.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.822
Said he slipped
in the bath
or something.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.857
I'll tell you,
Karl never had a grudge.

13:12.859 --> 13:15.093
Everybody here,
bonuses at Christmas

13:15.095 --> 13:17.796
and the customer
was always satisfied.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.998
You handle his
public relations, too?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.233
I never had a problem with Karl.

13:22.235 --> 13:25.804
He hired me when I was a little
<i> kalyaka,</i> right off the plane.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.205
Hardly spoke English.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.874
He gave me
a place to sleep

13:29.876 --> 13:31.109
and a place to work.

13:31.111 --> 13:34.813
Did this lovefest extend
to his kids?

13:34.815 --> 13:38.016
Karl and his boys--
he was very proud of them.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.018
He had a terrific family.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.586
GREEVEY:
Was he

13:41.588 --> 13:43.354
sole owner of the business?

13:43.356 --> 13:44.823
Why?

13:45.592 --> 13:47.292
It's a normal question.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.294
Must be worth, what
ten, 15 million?

13:49.296 --> 13:51.196
What's gonna happen to it?

13:51.198 --> 13:53.598
I have a small piece.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.233
How small?

13:55.235 --> 13:56.301
Ten percent.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.970
And the rest?

13:58.972 --> 14:02.006
I know what you're thinking.
That's crazy.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.142
Greg and Nick,
they're good sons.

14:04.144 --> 14:07.846
The sons-- they inherit it.

14:07.848 --> 14:11.616
Yeah, they get the business.

14:13.119 --> 14:15.386
Oh, by the way,
if you don't mind

14:15.388 --> 14:17.589
what were you doing
Saturday night?

14:17.591 --> 14:20.058
I had dinner.

14:20.060 --> 14:23.161
Little Kiev, Brighton Beach.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.597
Blini, herring,
Russian food.

14:25.599 --> 14:28.399
Russians, we need
reminders of home--

14:28.401 --> 14:30.902
of the food,
anyway.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.437
Rostov's the owner.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.305
He knows me.

14:34.307 --> 14:37.408
You eat alone?

14:37.410 --> 14:40.111
Sasha Osinski.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.981
He is from Kiev, too.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.453
You and your husband
were with Mr. Petrovich

14:48.455 --> 14:50.088
at Little Kiev?

14:59.332 --> 15:02.934
He says, yes,
we ate with Alex.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.003
What time did Alex arrive?

15:07.274 --> 15:08.973
Why don't you tell us?

15:08.975 --> 15:11.276
6:30, 7:00.

15:11.278 --> 15:14.345
We were there until after 11:00.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.347
That's a long party.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.216
Not for Russians.

15:26.927 --> 15:31.696
My husband says tell you
America's great country.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.698
Anybody can get rich.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.669
Except cops.

15:37.671 --> 15:39.304
Thank you.

15:41.675 --> 15:44.342
Max has got these kids
tried and convicted already.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.077
Give me another suspect,
any other suspect,

15:46.079 --> 15:48.413
with means, motive,
opportunity

15:48.415 --> 15:51.182
and don't say the mob because
they don't whack wives.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.717
Max ain't wrong.
Petrovich doesn't benefit.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.452
Ten percent's not enough motive.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.287
And no means.
He's got an alibi.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.389
Plus there are
no loose ends.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.426
Prints on the gun,
powder on the kid's hands

16:01.428 --> 16:03.127
and they inherit
ten mill plus.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.196
Yeah, well, you know
what I'd like to know?

16:05.198 --> 16:07.131
How Jarmon<i> really</i>
broke his jaw.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.434
You got
the housekeeper's number?

16:09.436 --> 16:13.471
Yeah. We might as well ask her
Jarmon's bedroom secrets

16:13.473 --> 16:15.440
while we're at it.

16:15.442 --> 16:19.043
She just might give you
the family doctor

16:19.045 --> 16:20.478
if you're polite.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.514
I'm sorry.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.549
I just can't
tell you fellows anything.

16:24.551 --> 16:27.218
It's patient confidentiality.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.421
Your patient is dead.

16:30.423 --> 16:34.292
We can assume he would
want you to cooperate.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.527
It was not
a big deal.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.530
Well, then why was
his whole jaw wired shut?

16:39.532 --> 16:41.432
Come on, doc.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.435
Jarmon's face didn't run
into a bathtub.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.237
Isn't that right?

16:48.174 --> 16:51.109
He told me
Nick broke it.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.544
I don't know
the circumstances.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.685
I've gone to 23 games
this season.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.087
Sometimes we stay
till the end

17:03.089 --> 17:04.288
and sometimes we don't.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.290
We didn't stay
till the end.

17:06.292 --> 17:08.226
This is crap.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.727
I don't believe this.

17:09.729 --> 17:13.297
Then help us help you, Nick.

17:13.299 --> 17:17.101
Last time I saw my parents,
they were both alive.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.174
Okay. Let's move on.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.611
How about your dad?

17:26.613 --> 17:29.080
Did you get along with him?

17:29.082 --> 17:31.315
He had his own point of view...

17:31.317 --> 17:34.385
a code he wanted me
to live up to.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.154
And when you didn't?

17:36.156 --> 17:38.322
Look. Maybe I didn't
like my father.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.391
Maybe some days I didn't
even love him.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.094
Do you love your parents
every day of the week?

17:46.199 --> 17:47.598
Breaking his jaw--

17:47.600 --> 17:50.601
that your way
of showing affection?

17:50.603 --> 17:52.603
I was out with some buddies.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.072
I came home drunk.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.307
My father didn't want
to let me in

17:56.309 --> 17:59.077
till I sobered up.

17:59.813 --> 18:01.579
You broke his jaw over that?

18:01.581 --> 18:03.281
It was a stupid mistake.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.682
I told you, I was drunk.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.284
Haven't you ever hurt

18:06.286 --> 18:07.385
anybody you loved?

18:07.387 --> 18:10.354
Never put them
in the emergency room.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.156
I loved my parents.

18:12.158 --> 18:16.327
My mom... I never, ever would
have done anything to hurt her.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.662
He was drunk.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.664
Dad tried to push him
out of the house.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.165
Nick took a swing.

18:21.167 --> 18:23.835
Next day he wasn't
real happy with himself.

18:23.837 --> 18:26.270
It hurt him more
than it hurt your dad?

18:26.272 --> 18:28.639
We have "stupid" written
on our faces or what?

18:28.641 --> 18:31.309
Greg, help yourself out
a little, all right?

18:31.311 --> 18:32.877
Give us some truth here.

18:32.879 --> 18:37.215
You guys seriously think
we'd kill our own mother?

18:37.217 --> 18:39.383
You don't get anything.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.830
They sure don't sound

18:52.832 --> 18:54.699
like they want
their mother dead.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.335
She was supposed to be
out that night, right?

18:57.337 --> 18:58.769
At some benefit.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.639
Maybe they never
expected to kill her.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.342
She came home early,
or she never left.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.344
It was a mistake.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.913
What, you think they just
planned to kill the old man?

19:08.915 --> 19:11.782
That wouldn't put money
in their pockets.

19:11.784 --> 19:12.917
What is this?

19:12.919 --> 19:15.753
You got anybody
who looks better?

19:15.755 --> 19:17.355
Petrovich is out.

19:17.357 --> 19:20.224
Ask me, the housekeeper
ain't a murderess

19:20.226 --> 19:21.759
but who knows?

19:21.761 --> 19:26.664
We rubber hose her,
maybe she confesses.

19:26.666 --> 19:30.668
Mr. Jarmon was very demanding
of the boys.

19:30.670 --> 19:34.272
When he thought
they'd failed him...

19:34.274 --> 19:36.274
What did he do?

19:36.276 --> 19:38.476
He had a short fuse.

19:38.478 --> 19:41.679
Mrs. Jarmon kept reminding him

19:41.681 --> 19:43.181
they were
only children.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.383
Nick get the worst of it?

19:45.385 --> 19:50.755
Well, you must understand,
he was the first child.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.390
Mrs. Langdon, please.

19:52.392 --> 19:55.293
You're not speaking ill
of the dead.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.327
We have to know.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.896
Did he beat
his kid or not?

20:01.401 --> 20:03.367
Almost every day.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.271
He'd use whatever
was at hand--

20:07.273 --> 20:08.940
a belt,
a tennis racquet.

20:08.942 --> 20:14.212
One time he used
a wooden coat hanger.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.414
Nobody ever stopped him?

20:16.416 --> 20:19.917
Mrs. Jarmon
was terrified of him.

20:19.919 --> 20:22.253
It went on for years.

20:22.255 --> 20:26.791
Finally, when Nick was 16,
he hit him back.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.996
Mr. Jarmon never raised a hand
to him after that.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.298
Except when Nick broke his jaw.

20:34.300 --> 20:37.969
No. That was because of Gregory.

20:37.971 --> 20:39.570
Greg punched his father?

20:40.573 --> 20:42.573
No.

20:42.575 --> 20:46.911
Mr. Jarmon was beating Gregory
with a cane.

20:46.913 --> 20:51.382
Nick had to put a stop to it,
and so he hit him.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.422
(<i> loud vacuum cleaner</i> )

20:58.424 --> 21:00.491
Anybody home?!

21:08.935 --> 21:10.334
Excuse me.

21:10.336 --> 21:12.303
Excuse me.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.910
Greg Jarmon around?

21:19.912 --> 21:24.048
He went out
about an hour ago.

21:24.050 --> 21:27.185
Who's idea is this?

21:27.186 --> 21:30.321
His. I think they're
putting the place up for sale.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.856
Excuse me.

21:31.858 --> 21:34.142
The brothers Jarmon

21:34.143 --> 21:36.427
are real sentimental
about their old homestead.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.828
Bad memories.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.830
Or bad consciences.

21:43.369 --> 21:46.304
I guess Jarmon
shot more than birds.

21:47.340 --> 21:50.041
I bet no one ever accused him

21:50.043 --> 21:52.410
of being a friend
of the earth.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.412
What's the story
these days

21:54.414 --> 21:56.080
with dead people's mail?

21:56.082 --> 22:00.851
If it's useful,
it's admissible...

22:00.853 --> 22:03.054
or maybe it's not.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.396
Jarmon's Rolls--

22:12.398 --> 22:14.065
leased-- $2,300 a month.

22:14.067 --> 22:15.499
That's twice my rent.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.535
Roomier, too.

22:17.537 --> 22:20.404
Bill from Bergdorf's...
$1,200...

22:20.406 --> 22:22.106
for three pairs of shoes.

22:22.108 --> 22:24.875
Spend it or lose it.

22:26.412 --> 22:27.645
This seem weird to you?

22:27.647 --> 22:29.647
"Dean of Communication Arts

22:29.649 --> 22:32.616
personal progress report
on Gregory Jarmon."

22:37.523 --> 22:40.358
"Greg has shown
significant improvement.

22:40.360 --> 22:44.095
I'm confident he will soon be
working up to his potential."

22:44.097 --> 22:46.130
Since when do college deans

22:46.132 --> 22:48.632
write parents
about their kids' grades?

22:49.969 --> 22:51.969
No, we don't routinely

22:51.971 --> 22:55.039
send personal evaluations
to parents.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.108
Except..?

22:57.110 --> 23:00.444
Mr. Jarmon
is an involved alumnus.

23:00.446 --> 23:04.615
A significant contributor
to the university.

23:04.617 --> 23:07.385
Well, that rates a plaque
and a tax deduction,

23:07.387 --> 23:08.419
not surveillance reports.

23:08.421 --> 23:09.954
Plain English?

23:09.956 --> 23:12.056
You're the communications whiz.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.659
He was out of control.

23:15.661 --> 23:18.462
He dragged Greg in here
last November

23:18.464 --> 23:21.499
ranting at the top of
his lungs about his grades.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.634
He even slapped him
in front of me.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.536
How did Greg take it?

23:25.538 --> 23:27.004
He took it.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.073
He was too terrified not to.

23:33.446 --> 23:37.448
I thought the evaluations
would calm Jarmon down.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.917
Get him to ease off.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.186
Poor kid.

23:42.188 --> 23:45.456
He was humiliated.

23:45.458 --> 23:48.025
Nobody cares if Karl Jarmon
is a saint or Simon Legree.

23:48.027 --> 23:51.162
You've spoken to so many people
that by tomorrow

23:51.164 --> 23:54.031
the papers will say
the kids are suspects.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.933
You're asking us to give
the public an arrest

23:55.935 --> 23:57.001
just because they want one?

23:57.003 --> 23:59.203
I'm asking if they're guilty.

23:59.205 --> 24:01.439
In my book,
top of the hit parade.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.541
Hey, let me tell you
somethingyou gave me a shotgun

24:03.543 --> 24:05.509
when my mother slammed me
against a wall

24:05.511 --> 24:07.511
I'd have blown
her head off.

24:07.513 --> 24:08.712
But my dad?

24:08.714 --> 24:11.649
Not even if he caught me
killing the old lady.

24:11.651 --> 24:14.752
Except we have
their prints on the gun.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.487
The paraffin test...

24:16.489 --> 24:18.656
Their buddy corroborated
they were out skeet shooting.

24:18.658 --> 24:20.057
That's not exculpatory.

24:20.059 --> 24:22.059
They only have
each other as alibis.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.762
Motive? Physical abuse,
the broken jaw,

24:24.764 --> 24:27.631
emotional manipulation...
not to mention $10 million.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.033
Means? They're both
experienced hunters.

24:29.035 --> 24:31.035
One's prints
are on the gun.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.136
I'm convinced.

24:32.138 --> 24:35.005
He's convinced. Go get them.

24:43.082 --> 24:46.217
If your parents were
getting fitted for a casket

24:46.219 --> 24:49.620
would you unwind by
playing a little squash?

24:52.692 --> 24:55.092
Gregory Jarmon, Nicholas Jarmon

24:55.094 --> 24:56.527
you're under arrest

24:56.529 --> 24:59.196
for the murder
of Evelyn and Karl Jarmon.

24:59.198 --> 25:00.998
You have the right
to remain silent

25:01.000 --> 25:02.600
and refuse
to answer questions.

25:02.602 --> 25:03.634
Do you understand?

25:03.636 --> 25:05.436
Anything you do say

25:05.437 --> 25:07.237
may be used against you
in a court of law.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.940
Do you understand?

25:08.941 --> 25:10.641
You have the right
to consult an attorney...

25:14.580 --> 25:17.548
And the paraffin test
on the younger kid?

25:17.550 --> 25:19.617
No conclusive match on
the powder that killed him.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.218
The lab says
it can't be done.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.954
So we put our shoulder
into the motive.

25:23.956 --> 25:25.823
They hated the father.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.691
We called
your secretary.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.560
She said
you'd be here.

25:29.562 --> 25:32.263
Mike's running me
around the block on this one.

25:32.265 --> 25:33.764
In which direction?

25:33.766 --> 25:35.766
All right, the old man--
he's a bastard.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.568
But the mother,
there's nothing there.

25:37.570 --> 25:41.272
Greg letting loose on her while
she's coming down the stairs?

25:41.274 --> 25:42.873
Come on, I just don't see that.

25:42.875 --> 25:46.544
Is this about evidence
or instinct?

25:46.546 --> 25:49.713
With what we have now,
80-20 we put him away.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.582
Is there something
personal here?

25:51.584 --> 25:55.619
I personally don't like to see
innocent kids get 20 to life.

25:55.621 --> 25:56.921
You agree?

25:59.725 --> 26:01.592
Play it for him.

26:02.728 --> 26:06.597
It's a copy
of Greg's call to 911.

26:06.599 --> 26:08.232
Oh, God, they're dead!

26:08.234 --> 26:09.633
They're dead!

26:09.635 --> 26:10.868
Who's dead, sir?
OPERATOR:

26:10.870 --> 26:12.803
My mom's been shot!

26:12.805 --> 26:14.004
My father, too! There's blood.

26:14.006 --> 26:15.272
Help me, please!

26:15.274 --> 26:17.608
your address?
Can you give me

26:17.610 --> 26:18.809
Just send somebody!

26:18.811 --> 26:21.612
You ask me?

26:21.614 --> 26:23.847
Nobody's that good an actor.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.284
Great.

26:27.286 --> 26:34.224
So according to you two,
we now have no suspects.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.277
Oh, brother.

26:36.278 --> 26:38.329
I've heard of playing
both sides of the fence

26:38.331 --> 26:40.364
but this is ridiculous.

26:40.366 --> 26:43.734
They were sure enough a week ago
to make an arrest.

26:43.736 --> 26:46.704
They were probably right then
and probably wrong now

26:46.706 --> 26:49.707
but if I convince a jury,
and we're wrong...

26:49.709 --> 26:51.976
Uh-huh.
<i> Cui bono,--</i> who benefits?

26:51.978 --> 26:53.978
Look at the rank of hand.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.613
He's killed.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.815
Number one is the wife--
she's dead.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.383
Go to two-- kids.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.051
Three-- business partner.

27:01.053 --> 27:03.687
The kids inherit everything
but ten percent.

27:03.689 --> 27:05.623
Even this...
what's his name?

27:05.625 --> 27:06.624
Petrovich.

27:06.626 --> 27:07.891
Petrovich, yeah.

27:07.893 --> 27:09.660
Even if he's clean

27:09.662 --> 27:12.663
you know what
Dwight Andersen's going to do.

27:12.665 --> 27:14.965
Confuse the jury,
hands them another suspect.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.001
They acquit on reasonable doubt.

27:17.003 --> 27:18.736
Don't get outflanked.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.872
Clear Petrovich so they can't
use him against you.

27:21.874 --> 27:24.375
We know Petrovich
has two alibi witnesses.

27:24.377 --> 27:26.677
He was in Brighton Beach
at 7:00.

27:26.679 --> 27:29.346
Driving in rush hour, it had
to take him at least an hour.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.682
You check out everybody
at the table that night?

27:31.684 --> 27:34.168
Come on,
we don't clear everybody.

27:34.169 --> 27:36.653
We didn't clear the housekeeper
or Nick's girlfriend either.

27:36.656 --> 27:38.922
What are you saying, that
there's a conspiracy here?

27:38.924 --> 27:40.891
With the alibis,
it's not unheard of.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.292
With who?

27:42.294 --> 27:44.662
The discount store owner,
Osinski?

27:44.664 --> 27:45.896
What, he smuggles blinis

27:45.898 --> 27:47.398
and caviar
on the side?

27:47.400 --> 27:50.701
ROBINETTE:
The way Jarmon's
corporation is set up

27:50.703 --> 27:52.369
Petrovich
takes nothing--

27:52.371 --> 27:54.438
just keeps
his ten percent.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.974
But there are
the inheritance laws.

27:56.976 --> 27:59.109
Right. If the kids
are convicted

27:59.111 --> 28:01.412
they can't profit
from their crime.

28:01.414 --> 28:03.564
Which means Petrovich

28:03.565 --> 28:05.715
ends up with control
of the company.

28:05.718 --> 28:08.886
Jarmon's 90% goes
into a non-voting trust.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.691
Subpoena Petrovich's
financial records.

28:13.693 --> 28:15.693
Jarmon's, too.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.929
People's Bank of Brooklyn,
Brighton Beach.

28:18.931 --> 28:21.699
Petrovich wrote a check
reimbursing the company.

28:21.701 --> 28:22.966
Travel allowance.

28:22.968 --> 28:25.035
He lives on
Upper Madison Avenue

28:25.037 --> 28:27.104
but he has a checking
account in Brooklyn.

28:27.106 --> 28:28.556
I grew up in Harlem,

28:28.557 --> 28:30.007
but my checking account's
across the street.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.709
What the hell's he doing
banking out there?

28:31.711 --> 28:35.713
Bar Association dinner,
I sat with the Brooklyn DAs.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.948
What's their biggest problem?

28:37.950 --> 28:40.718
Russian immigrant gangsters.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.053
Young assistant there,
Epstein...

28:43.055 --> 28:46.090
Jim... Jerry... Jack.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.758
Jack Epstein.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.094
Go talk to him.

28:50.096 --> 28:52.830
Here we are.

28:52.832 --> 28:55.799
106 active cases with Russians.

28:55.801 --> 28:59.403
Credit card fraud,
protection rackets

28:59.405 --> 29:01.071
15, 20 homicides.

29:01.073 --> 29:02.906
You put anybody
inside?

29:02.908 --> 29:04.808
There guys-- they make
the mafia's<i> omerta</i>

29:04.810 --> 29:06.376
look like an open phone line.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.946
I guess when you've been
in prison in Leningrad

29:08.948 --> 29:10.848
New York Cops
look like Mickey Mouse.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.516
The name
Petrovich ring a bell?

29:12.518 --> 29:14.785
30,000 Russian immigrants here.

29:14.787 --> 29:16.754
I got Petrovichs, Petrovskys.

29:16.756 --> 29:19.189
I had a Petrovarich
who took the banks

29:19.191 --> 29:21.925
for half a million
on fake credit cards.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.427
How do they clean money?

29:23.429 --> 29:25.062
They're gangsters.

29:25.064 --> 29:26.830
They take over
legitimate businesses.

29:26.832 --> 29:28.766
You got it.

29:28.768 --> 29:32.436
Come on,
let me show you something.

29:36.509 --> 29:38.175
See that?

29:39.545 --> 29:41.879
Second floor,
on the corner.

29:41.881 --> 29:44.414
People's Bank
of Brighton Beach.

29:45.885 --> 29:49.953
Yeah, that check
you found?

29:49.955 --> 29:51.989
Comes from
that bank, right?

29:51.991 --> 29:52.990
Yeah.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.424
Four rooms.

29:54.426 --> 29:56.994
Six guards with
the combined I.Q. of 38.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.796
Like the immigrants
that came before them--

29:58.798 --> 30:00.648
Chinese, Italian--

30:00.649 --> 30:02.499
they set up banks
to wash their money.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.535
Checking accounts
are not a large part

30:04.537 --> 30:06.069
of their business?

30:06.071 --> 30:09.439
If you don't have other
business with them, no.

30:13.412 --> 30:14.912
Killing their parents.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.480
How do you explain it?

30:16.482 --> 30:19.082
You know,
I was Karl's bookkeeper

30:19.084 --> 30:21.852
before he could afford
a shoeshine.

30:21.854 --> 30:25.055
God bless America--
you know what he started with?

30:25.057 --> 30:26.523
Business cards.

30:26.525 --> 30:30.227
He had these two old machines
that blew powder

30:30.229 --> 30:32.462
into the ink-- cheap
raised lettering, huh?

30:32.464 --> 30:35.132
Was Jarmon Printing in debt?

30:35.134 --> 30:37.935
Who isn't?

30:37.937 --> 30:39.236
Right.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.438
Tell me about it.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.240
Karl was always expanding

30:43.242 --> 30:47.144
but the last couple of months,
he borrowed a lot of cash.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.213
Dropped it into CDs.

30:49.215 --> 30:50.480
Why?

30:50.482 --> 30:52.249
He never told me anything

30:52.251 --> 30:54.368
but the figures.

30:54.369 --> 30:56.486
The company's debt
was six million and change.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.589
Karl wanted to consolidate it.

30:58.591 --> 31:01.124
Who holds the paper?

31:01.126 --> 31:03.060
Try this-- past six years,
Jarmon borrowed

31:03.062 --> 31:06.029
six million bucks
from First Mercantile.

31:06.031 --> 31:07.898
I thought that
went under.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.516
it did, three months ago.

31:09.517 --> 31:11.133
Federal bank regulators
sold off their loans.

31:11.136 --> 31:12.870
Guess who bought Jarmon's?

31:12.872 --> 31:14.304
The Russians.

31:14.306 --> 31:17.541
People's Bank
of Brighton Beach.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.142
A classic squeeze.

31:19.144 --> 31:21.278
They call in his debt,
he can't pay

31:21.280 --> 31:22.613
they take the company.

31:22.615 --> 31:25.015
And he knew--
that's why he was out borrowing,

31:25.017 --> 31:27.318
trying to pay them off.

31:27.319 --> 31:29.620
And what did Petrovich say
to the cops?

31:31.223 --> 31:34.658
"He gave me a place to sleep,
a place to work."

31:34.660 --> 31:37.527
And he wanted the bed
all to himself.

31:37.529 --> 31:40.497
You think Jarmon knew
that it was Petrovich?

31:40.499 --> 31:44.501
He had to know something,
and either way Petrovich loses.

31:44.503 --> 31:47.504
If Jarmon finds out,
he gets rid of him.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.506
If Jarmon stops the Russians

31:49.508 --> 31:52.009
they're not going
to be too pleased

31:52.011 --> 31:53.577
with Petrovich either.

31:53.579 --> 31:56.513
A prosecution based
on debt re-financing--

31:56.515 --> 31:59.616
it's going to get you real far
with the jury.

31:59.618 --> 32:01.018
I'll let it out for them.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.120
I'll draw them a Monopoly board.

32:03.121 --> 32:05.221
Yeah, I'd like to see them
get from Park Place to Go.

32:05.224 --> 32:06.623
Juries aren't stupid.

32:06.625 --> 32:09.960
I show them Petrovich was angry,
he was jealous

32:09.962 --> 32:11.995
he bridled at Jarmon's abuse.

32:11.997 --> 32:14.665
He kills the parents,
implicates the kids

32:14.667 --> 32:16.667
takes over Jarmon Printing
when the kids are convicted.

32:16.669 --> 32:20.037
So Petrovich inherits
the company?

32:20.039 --> 32:21.571
Better, the company accountant
tells me

32:21.573 --> 32:23.073
that Petrovich takes control.

32:23.075 --> 32:26.043
Jarmon's share
goes into a non-voting trust.

32:26.045 --> 32:28.012
The company is sold.

32:28.013 --> 32:29.980
The cash is distributed
among various family members.

32:29.982 --> 32:32.316
But there wouldn't be any cash
for the family.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.952
Exactly.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.587
It all goes to pay off notes
held by the Russian's bank.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.056
That's a great theory

32:39.058 --> 32:41.224
but you cannot prove
that he hated Jarmon

32:41.226 --> 32:42.893
and you cannot prove

32:42.894 --> 32:44.561
that he tried
to steal the company.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.964
You're sure
that the kids didn't do this?

32:46.966 --> 32:48.999
Sure enough to drop the charges.

32:49.001 --> 32:50.400
And the Russian mafia?

32:50.402 --> 32:52.402
You think you're going to win

32:52.404 --> 32:55.973
when the Brooklyn D.A.
has been losing for five years?

32:55.975 --> 32:58.141
I'm going
to tell you this--

32:58.143 --> 33:01.578
if Petrovich did kill them,
you'll never get him.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.613
He'll walk.

33:07.219 --> 33:08.385
Take my word for it.

33:08.387 --> 33:09.619
We've tried ten, 12 cases.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.805
You can't turn a Russian.

33:11.806 --> 33:13.990
Yeah, I'd like to turn
this one till he's dizzy.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.759
We don't break
Petrovich's alibi

33:15.761 --> 33:17.394
shaky's not the word
for it.

33:17.396 --> 33:18.996
Try instant acquittal.

33:18.998 --> 33:21.398
There were five people
at that table that night.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.534
What if one of them
didn't have clean papers?

33:24.536 --> 33:26.436
Illegal alien? Plane
ticket back to Moscow?

33:26.438 --> 33:29.740
I got a guy at Immigration.

33:29.742 --> 33:33.443
Dead-end. Everybody there
had at least a green card.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.278
Another way into his life?

33:35.280 --> 33:37.214
Not through
the front door.

33:37.216 --> 33:39.416
His wife died two years
ago, no girlfriends.

33:39.418 --> 33:40.751
What about the secretary?

33:40.753 --> 33:42.219
Worth a shot.

33:42.221 --> 33:43.653
And the Jarmon boys.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.722
After being arrested, you think
they're want to help us?

33:45.724 --> 33:49.059
If Petrovich
killed their parents

33:49.061 --> 33:54.765
they'll help, no matter
how they feel about us.

33:54.767 --> 33:56.733
You know what it's like?

33:56.735 --> 33:58.235
People stare on the street.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.804
As far as a lot of people
are concerned

34:00.806 --> 34:02.706
we'll always be guilty.

34:02.708 --> 34:05.742
The system makes mistakes.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.377
Is this some kind
of end play?

34:07.379 --> 34:08.712
I want your assurance
right now.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.781
They don't say word one
until you tell me

34:10.783 --> 34:11.748
you're not going
to re-indict.

34:11.750 --> 34:16.319
We are not going to re-indict.

34:16.321 --> 34:19.689
Now, we're up
against a wall.

34:19.691 --> 34:23.627
From what we've
discovered

34:23.629 --> 34:27.431
we believe that Petrovich
killed your parents

34:27.433 --> 34:30.834
But we can't
prove it.

34:30.836 --> 34:32.836
We thought you could help us.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.840
Dad treated him
like dirt

34:36.842 --> 34:39.509
but he treated
everybody that way.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.778
STONE:
Well, how does
this sound?

34:41.780 --> 34:43.613
You leave the house.

34:43.615 --> 34:44.848
Petrovich shows up.

34:44.850 --> 34:47.084
Your father lets him in.

34:47.086 --> 34:49.519
Maybe he knows your mother's
home, maybe not.

34:49.521 --> 34:53.390
He goes into the study,
apparently to get a drink.

34:53.392 --> 34:55.692
Alex would have
poured two scotches.

34:55.694 --> 34:56.760
He always did.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.361
He gets the gun

34:58.363 --> 34:59.629
from the rack.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.865
He goes for the ammunition
in the desk...

35:01.867 --> 35:03.366
No.

35:03.368 --> 35:05.135
The basement.
In a locked cabinet.

35:05.137 --> 35:06.636
Dad never kept ammo
near the guns.

35:06.638 --> 35:09.773
12-gauge National shells?

35:09.775 --> 35:10.774
National?

35:10.776 --> 35:12.743
He didn't use them
anymore.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.711
He won a trap shoot last
spring with Remingtons.

35:14.713 --> 35:17.314
He didn't use anything
else after that.

35:17.316 --> 35:18.882
Before, like, a month
before the match,

35:18.884 --> 35:20.684
Dad dragged Alex
out to watch.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.552
He would have thought
dad used Nationals.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.788
Call Greevey and Logan.

35:24.790 --> 35:28.358
Tracing ammunition--
simple, and not so simple.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.394
Not simple with 100 gun
shops in the five burroughs.

35:31.396 --> 35:34.898
But simple because you need
a gun permit to buy ammunition.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.900
If Petrovich
bought the shells

35:36.902 --> 35:39.369
he had to sign
for them.

35:39.371 --> 35:40.904
Not simple, he doesn't
own a gun, no permits.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.573
We're talking the whole
state of New York.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.842
It's like a twig in a haystack.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.844
Let's call National.

35:47.845 --> 35:49.845
Maybe we get a trace
on the lot numbers
from the shells..

35:49.848 --> 35:52.916
I got another
million-to-one shot.
Go.

35:52.918 --> 35:54.918
Petrovich drove to Brooklyn.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.754
Means, he probably drove
to Jarmon's house.

35:57.756 --> 35:59.890
He wouldn't want
the car to be seen.

35:59.892 --> 36:01.491
He'd go to a garage.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.727
Within walking distance.

36:03.729 --> 36:07.364
Two mighty big ifs,
gentlemen.

36:07.366 --> 36:08.798
Simple.

36:14.606 --> 36:16.907
Petrovich parked
two blocks away.

36:16.909 --> 36:19.609
In: 6:35, out: 7:08.

36:19.611 --> 36:21.211
Very impressive.

36:21.213 --> 36:23.213
That's the good news.

36:23.215 --> 36:25.382
Yeah, those shells.

36:25.384 --> 36:27.484
They were shipped
to 49 different gun shops.

36:27.486 --> 36:28.919
And if it wasn't
Petrovich,

36:28.921 --> 36:30.620
we don't even know
who we're looking for.

36:30.622 --> 36:31.688
You know, gun dealers,

36:31.689 --> 36:32.755
they're not going
to remember every guy

36:32.758 --> 36:33.890
in a duck-billed hat

36:33.892 --> 36:37.727
that buys double-ought,
12-gauge shot.

36:37.729 --> 36:38.962
Where's Hicks Street?

36:38.964 --> 36:41.865
Brooklyn Heights.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.600
Avenue J?

36:43.602 --> 36:44.901
Flatbush.
Flatbush.

36:44.903 --> 36:45.969
Coney Island Avenue?

36:45.971 --> 36:47.904
Brighton Beach.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.507
Let's go.

36:50.509 --> 36:53.210
Not much deer hunting
out here, huh?

36:53.212 --> 36:54.844
Out here?

36:54.846 --> 36:57.514
(<i> laughs</i> )
Plenty of shooting,
but not at animals.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.849
We do a good business
in carry weapons.

36:59.851 --> 37:02.219
Mm.

37:02.221 --> 37:05.589
You sell any National
double-ought, 12-gauge shot?

37:05.591 --> 37:07.757
Oh, talk about inventory.

37:07.759 --> 37:10.927
I got a case of it.

37:10.929 --> 37:12.929
I sold one box.

37:12.931 --> 37:16.433
You want
to get your log?

37:16.435 --> 37:17.901
Some Russian.

37:17.903 --> 37:20.237
Myself, I'm Polish.

37:20.239 --> 37:22.939
We don't like
the Russians.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.574
They kept invading.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.810
A Russian? Well-dressed?

37:26.812 --> 37:28.278
In Odessa maybe.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.946
He must have
rolled some bum

37:29.948 --> 37:31.548
to get that suit.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.717
Let's see... here.

37:33.719 --> 37:34.884
Two months ago.

37:34.886 --> 37:36.686
Osinski, Sasha.

37:36.688 --> 37:38.688
He runs a discount store

37:38.690 --> 37:39.856
six blocks away.

37:39.858 --> 37:42.892
What's Russian for
"You're under arrest"?

37:42.894 --> 37:44.561
MAN:
<i> The charge is murder</i>

37:44.563 --> 37:45.695
in the second degree.

37:45.697 --> 37:47.664
How does the
defendant plead?

37:47.666 --> 37:49.633
Not guilty, Your Honor.

37:49.635 --> 37:51.868
Your Honor, as you know,
charges in this case

37:51.870 --> 37:54.504
were previously filed
and dismissed.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.573
Now, because of
the public attention,

37:56.575 --> 37:58.842
perhaps the People
are a little overzealous.

37:58.844 --> 38:02.679
Mr. Schwab, I don't need a map
to see where you're going,

38:02.681 --> 38:05.315
but based
on the prosecutor's information,

38:05.317 --> 38:06.883
there is a case here.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.286
Why don't we hear
from the People on bail.

38:09.288 --> 38:10.754
Your Honor,
as our information states,

38:10.756 --> 38:12.756
aside from the risk of flight

38:12.758 --> 38:15.659
we feel there is a question
of the defendant's safety.

38:15.661 --> 38:16.960
We request he be held
without bail.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.895
Your Honor, the defendant
is not concerned

38:18.897 --> 38:20.964
for his own safety,

38:20.966 --> 38:22.732
and he runs
a complex business.

38:22.734 --> 38:24.668
JUDGE:
I have to tell you, Counselor,

38:24.670 --> 38:26.870
that aside from the seriousness
of the charge,

38:26.872 --> 38:29.773
I'm concerned that the defendant
be alive at trial.

38:29.775 --> 38:33.677
The defendant will
be held without bail.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.712
You think they're
<i> that</i> trigger-happy?

38:35.714 --> 38:37.981
Would they get rid
of Petrovich?

38:37.983 --> 38:39.433
Maybe not.

38:39.434 --> 38:40.884
The store owner, Osinski?
No question.

38:40.886 --> 38:42.052
Who did you draw
for trial?

38:42.054 --> 38:43.953
ROBINETTE:
Callahan.
Callahan.

38:43.955 --> 38:46.790
SCHIFF:
Doesn't like
locking up witnesses.

38:46.792 --> 38:48.758
Anybody in that neighborhood
finds out

38:48.760 --> 38:51.828
we had one interview
with Osinski, he's dead meat.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.930
All right, Ben, I want
you to see Callahan,

38:53.932 --> 38:56.766
and I want you to take
Epstein with you.

38:56.768 --> 38:59.035
And let's just hope
and pray that it works.

38:59.037 --> 39:01.771
If you don't break Osinski,
forget about a conviction.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.540
We still got
the garage ticket.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.642
No, that's
circumstantial.

39:05.644 --> 39:08.378
Guy gets to Brooklyn
7:20 instead of 7:00.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.113
Makes him guilty
of murder?

39:10.115 --> 39:11.815
Prove the motive.

39:11.817 --> 39:14.884
You want me to incarcerate
a material witness without bail?

39:14.886 --> 39:19.089
Your Honor, these gentlemen,
they like their secrets kept,

39:19.091 --> 39:22.025
and Mr. Epstein here can vouch
for their predilections.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.993
Immigrant Russian gangsters.

39:23.995 --> 39:26.996
I thought
they opened dry cleaners.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.365
Judge, from our experience,

39:28.367 --> 39:30.567
these guys don't
bother asking questions.

39:30.569 --> 39:31.901
They just shoot.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.636
All right, I'll sign

39:33.638 --> 39:36.706
a material witness order
with no bail.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.775
Thanks, sir.
Mr. Stone,

39:38.777 --> 39:40.143
I hope
this plays out in court.

39:40.145 --> 39:41.845
Yes, sir.

39:43.849 --> 39:46.049
MAN:
<i> in here. the time is up</i>

39:46.051 --> 39:47.918
(<i> metal door slamming</i> )

39:47.919 --> 39:49.786
Mr. Osinski has a wife
and three children.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.755
Offer him
my congratulations.

39:51.757 --> 39:53.957
He says he was
with Mr. Petrovich.

39:53.959 --> 39:55.959
Your client bought
the ammunition.

39:55.961 --> 39:57.026
Accessory
before the fact.

39:57.028 --> 39:58.862
If he lies--
accessory after.

39:58.864 --> 40:01.097
If he thinks he had
a hard time in Russia,

40:01.099 --> 40:04.634
ten years in Attica will
make the KGB look good.

40:04.636 --> 40:05.835
I shoot rabbits
with shotgun.

40:05.837 --> 40:07.637
Shut up.

40:07.638 --> 40:09.438
You louse this up,
I am going to break your teeth!

40:09.441 --> 40:13.109
(<i> speaking Russian</i> )

40:13.111 --> 40:15.612
Mr. Osinski,
when you get out of prison

40:15.614 --> 40:19.115
if you survive,
odds are you'll be deported.

40:19.117 --> 40:21.050
We have a law

40:21.052 --> 40:24.154
about naturalized citizens
committing felonies.

40:24.156 --> 40:25.989
If you put him
on the stand,

40:25.991 --> 40:28.625
he will testify
he was with Petrovich.

40:28.627 --> 40:32.762
Your lawyer is not
giving you good advice.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.671
The People will prove
the defendant conspired

40:41.673 --> 40:43.039
to take over
Karl Jarmon's business,

40:43.041 --> 40:45.041
and when that plan went awry,

40:45.043 --> 40:47.043
he turned
to a violent solution:

40:47.045 --> 40:48.978
murder, in cold blood.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.713
Thank you.

40:56.021 --> 40:58.922
What a wonderful theory
Mr. Stone offers you.

40:58.924 --> 41:01.858
One problem: it's a theory.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.893
Now, what Mr. Stone
did not tell you

41:03.895 --> 41:07.497
is there's a difference
between theory and proof.

41:07.499 --> 41:10.099
The defense will show
that Alex Petrovich

41:10.101 --> 41:13.169
had nothing to gain
from Karl Jarmon's death.

41:13.171 --> 41:18.074
Which might make you wonder,
who did?

41:18.076 --> 41:20.777
STONE:
Now, do you recall
the time of day

41:20.779 --> 41:22.045
Greg Jarmon came to you

41:22.047 --> 41:23.947
and asked
for the company's tickets?

41:23.949 --> 41:26.916
It was just after lunch,
around 2:00.

41:26.918 --> 41:30.053
Now, do you recall when
the defendant came to you

41:30.055 --> 41:32.789
and asked you to make
a reservation for him

41:32.791 --> 41:33.957
at Little Kiev?

41:33.959 --> 41:35.925
It was about
five minutes later.

41:35.927 --> 41:38.695
What time did he ask you
to make the reservation for?

41:38.697 --> 41:42.765
7:00, on the same night
as the hockey game.

41:42.767 --> 41:43.967
Had you previously made
reservations for him

41:43.969 --> 41:45.068
at that restaurant?

41:45.070 --> 41:46.803
Yes.

41:46.804 --> 41:48.537
We're they ever
for dinner at 7:00?

41:48.540 --> 41:51.841
It was Mr. Petrovich's habit
to eat late.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.076
Around 9:00.

41:53.078 --> 41:54.811
STONE:
Thank you.

41:54.813 --> 41:57.013
Your witness.

41:57.015 --> 42:00.884
Did Mr. Petrovich
often eat at Little Kiev?

42:00.886 --> 42:02.118
Yes.

42:02.120 --> 42:05.121
Didn't he always
make reservations in advance?

42:05.924 --> 42:07.857
Yes, but...

42:07.859 --> 42:09.092
Because the place
was always booked.

42:09.094 --> 42:10.727
Isn't that correct?

42:10.729 --> 42:12.896
Yes, that's right.

42:12.898 --> 42:17.267
Fine. How long have you
worked for Mr. Petrovich?

42:17.269 --> 42:19.536
11 years.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.804
And during that time,
Mr. Petrovich and Mr. Jarmon

42:21.806 --> 42:24.040
worked closely together
as friends.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.042
Isn't that correct?
As friends?

42:26.044 --> 42:29.012
Didn't they work
closely together?

42:29.014 --> 42:31.915
Yes, they did.

42:31.917 --> 42:33.783
Thank you.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.985
No further questions.

42:35.987 --> 42:37.854
The People call
Alexander Osinski.

42:37.856 --> 42:38.988
Conference, Your Honor.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.323
We have a problem here.

42:40.325 --> 42:41.991
They threatened my client.

42:41.993 --> 42:43.993
No, sir,
we read him the law.

42:43.995 --> 42:45.995
He said
he would get him deported.

42:45.997 --> 42:47.864
I said he had good odds
of being deported.

42:47.866 --> 42:50.033
Judge,
with this prosecutorial abuse

42:50.035 --> 42:52.168
I think you should question
the credibility of the witness.

42:52.170 --> 42:53.903
Would you, now?

42:53.905 --> 42:56.005
Mr. Osinski tells the police
he was with the defendant.

42:56.007 --> 42:57.941
Why can't he say that
on the stand?

42:57.943 --> 43:00.910
Counselor, I'm going
to remind you of something

43:00.912 --> 43:02.612
you should already know.

43:02.614 --> 43:06.149
In this country,
you tell a client to lie

43:06.151 --> 43:08.217
it's subornation of perjury.

43:08.219 --> 43:09.919
If Mr. Stone
happens to prove that,

43:09.921 --> 43:12.021
you're in a hell of a lot
of trouble.

43:12.023 --> 43:16.025
You still want him
not to testify?

43:17.929 --> 43:21.297
Stone, Stone...
make me a deal.

43:21.299 --> 43:23.900
So your client
will tell the truth?

43:23.902 --> 43:25.335
He has to tell
the truth anyway.

43:25.337 --> 43:27.637
No deal?

43:27.639 --> 43:31.174
I suspect you won't get
the testimony you want.

43:31.176 --> 43:35.111
Okay, any crime arising
from this case

43:35.113 --> 43:37.981
New York County won't prosecute.

43:37.983 --> 43:39.382
Very good.

43:39.384 --> 43:44.320
Now, full immunity
on anything he testifies to.

43:44.322 --> 43:46.022
In New York County.

43:48.860 --> 43:51.027
Deal.

43:51.029 --> 43:53.096
OSINSKI:
Alex... Mr. Petrovich

43:53.098 --> 43:54.964
He comes to restaurant 9:00.

43:54.966 --> 43:56.265
Did he tell you

43:56.267 --> 43:58.968
to lie to the police,
to say he arrived earlier?

43:58.970 --> 44:01.004
Objection. Hearsay.

44:01.006 --> 44:04.073
Your Honor, exception:
covering flight from a crime.

44:04.075 --> 44:06.909
<i> People v. Deitch.</i>

44:08.146 --> 44:10.146
Hmm. Overruled.

44:10.148 --> 44:11.948
The witness will answer.

44:11.950 --> 44:13.950
Alex tells me to lie.

44:13.952 --> 44:14.984
He says police come.

44:14.986 --> 44:16.352
I say he there 7:00.

44:16.354 --> 44:18.221
Do you have deposits

44:18.223 --> 44:20.023
in the People's Bank
of Brighton Beach?

44:20.025 --> 44:21.891
Objection. Relevance.

44:21.893 --> 44:23.893
Your Honor, relevance will
soon become apparent.

44:23.895 --> 44:25.128
Overruled.

44:25.130 --> 44:26.963
Some of my money
in bank. Yeah.
Some.

44:26.965 --> 44:31.134
Well, the bank records show
that there was, last month,

44:31.136 --> 44:34.904
$6,011,301.26.

44:34.906 --> 44:37.106
If you say so.

44:37.108 --> 44:40.710
And the month before that,
$9,615.

44:40.712 --> 44:41.978
Sounds right.

44:41.980 --> 44:44.180
A $6 million
difference, uh...

44:44.182 --> 44:45.882
good month
at the discount store, sir?

44:45.884 --> 44:47.450
Didn't you receive that money

44:47.452 --> 44:50.119
from members
of a criminal organization

44:50.121 --> 44:52.155
composed of Russian immigrants?

44:52.157 --> 44:54.257
<i> Da.</i> Yes.

44:54.259 --> 44:57.026
Weren't you ordered
to instruct the bank
to use that money

44:57.028 --> 44:59.996
to buy up the debts
of Jarmon Printing?

44:59.998 --> 45:02.398
Objection!
Mr. Schwab, we've been there
and back.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.100
I'm allowing this testimony.

45:04.102 --> 45:06.035
The witness
will continue.

45:06.037 --> 45:09.105
OSINSKI:
Yeah, I tell bank
we take printing company.

45:09.107 --> 45:12.141
Alex say we put Mr. Jarmon
in gutter.

45:14.145 --> 45:15.945
Did Mr. Petrovich tell you

45:15.947 --> 45:18.314
he was worried about Karl Jarmon
discovering the plan?

45:18.316 --> 45:20.149
I worried.

45:20.151 --> 45:22.418
He tell me no problem.

45:22.420 --> 45:26.155
He take care of Mr. Jarmon...
for good.

45:36.034 --> 45:38.134
Alexander Osinski,
you're under arrest

45:38.136 --> 45:39.969
for conspiracy to
commit murder
Hey, what's this? I got deal.

45:39.971 --> 45:42.305
and enterprise
corruption.
What the hell?

45:42.307 --> 45:43.740
There's a deal in place.

45:43.742 --> 45:45.475
No prosecution in New York City.

45:45.477 --> 45:47.410
In New York County;
that's Manhattan.

45:47.412 --> 45:50.346
I never gave your client
immunity in Brooklyn.

45:50.348 --> 45:51.748
That's Kings County.

45:51.750 --> 45:52.982
He gave you Petrovich!

45:52.984 --> 45:55.151
And you gave me
Mr. Osinski.

45:55.153 --> 45:59.989
Next time, get yourself
a better lawyer, sir.

45:59.991 --> 46:02.058
On the sole count
of the indictment,

46:02.060 --> 46:06.229
murder in the second degree,
how does the jury find?

46:06.231 --> 46:09.132
We find the defendant guilty.

46:10.969 --> 46:12.268
Thank you
very much.

46:28.286 --> 46:30.253
This makes up
for arresting them.

46:30.255 --> 46:30.286
Ah, I wish it could make
up for being orphans.
