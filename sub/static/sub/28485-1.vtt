00:01.268 --> 00:02.901
        (dramatic tone)

00:12.546 --> 00:15.381
        (dramatic music)

00:29.330 --> 00:31.897
       (thunder roaring)

00:31.899 --> 00:34.733
        (rain splashing)

00:43.310 --> 00:46.745
    (swing chains squeaking)

01:15.643 --> 01:18.277
         (gentle music)

01:26.487 --> 01:27.719
        (board rattling)

01:27.721 --> 01:29.088
      - [Gabbie] When did
     you get a Ouija board?

01:29.090 --> 01:30.222
      - It doesn't matter.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.493
       Okay, so you know
      how to play, right?

01:34.495 --> 01:37.262
     - Um, we just put our
     hands on the pointer,

01:37.264 --> 01:39.064
     and ask it questions,
      and it moves, right?

01:39.066 --> 01:40.432
      - Well, it's called
        a play and chat,

01:40.434 --> 01:42.734
but more or less we just have to

01:42.736 --> 01:45.504
     move it around before
     we summon the spirits.

01:45.506 --> 01:48.140
  - Don't we need like candles
 or something for this to work.

01:48.142 --> 01:52.778
  - No, that's for like movies
   and witchcraft and stuff.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.046
      This is just a game.

01:54.048 --> 01:55.214
      It's not even real.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.151
   - Well, then do we have to
   play with the lights off?

01:59.153 --> 02:01.220
       Okay, just asking.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.088
       - Okay, you ready?

02:04.492 --> 02:07.593
   We have to say Ouija three
    times for this to work.

02:07.595 --> 02:08.526
         (tense music)

02:08.529 --> 02:13.732
 - [Girls] Ouija, Ouija, Ouija.

02:15.202 --> 02:17.069
- Are there any spirits with us?

02:18.873 --> 02:21.540
       If there are, can
      you give us a sign?

02:22.376 --> 02:26.845
  (suspenseful music swelling)

02:26.847 --> 02:28.313
 - Okay, this is stupid, Heidi.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.815
        - Okay, you have
       to wait a second.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.416
     You have to be patient
   with these kind of things.

02:31.418 --> 02:34.019
     - Oh, what like you're
   an expert on seances now.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.623
 - Okay, first of all, seances
   are just a group of people

02:37.625 --> 02:40.759
     sitting around a table
  looking into a crystal ball.

02:40.761 --> 02:44.296
       Alright, this is a
      board game, Gabbie.

02:44.298 --> 02:47.399
      It's not real, okay.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.333
       Just try it again.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.105
            - Ouija.

02:53.107 --> 02:55.641
         (tense music)

02:56.810 --> 02:57.676
             Ouija.

02:58.679 --> 02:59.411
         (wind chimes)

03:00.447 --> 03:01.280
             Ouija.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.815
       (thunder crashing)

03:03.817 --> 03:06.084
       - I call upon the
      spirits of the dead.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.620
   If there are any with us,

03:08.622 --> 03:10.522
  please make yourself known.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.359
        (dramatic music)

03:14.361 --> 03:15.961
      - You just moved it.
        - No, I didn't.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.196
      - Stop playing games
        with me, Heidi.

03:17.198 --> 03:18.697
 - I seriously did not move it.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.365
     - [Gabbie] This isn't
   funny you always do this.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.267
       - I never do this!

03:22.269 --> 03:24.403
    No, we're sitting in the
     closet playing a game!

03:24.405 --> 03:25.871
            - Heidi.
       - I never do this.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.842
 - Okay, let's just put it up.

03:30.844 --> 03:31.777
   You've proven your point.
          - No, wait!

03:31.779 --> 03:33.045
   I wanna see what it wants.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.813
     - I don't think that's
    a very good idea, Heidi.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.148
    - Don't be such a baby.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.851
 - No, I'm not playing anymore.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.058
       - Are you a ghost?

03:46.060 --> 03:48.961
        (dramatic music)

03:53.534 --> 03:54.800
       Guess that's a no.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.204
      - What's your name?

03:59.206 --> 04:00.505
       - Okay, if you're
    gonna ask it questions,

04:00.507 --> 04:03.609
      you have to put your
      hand on the Ouijat.

04:05.980 --> 04:08.046
        (ominous music)

04:08.048 --> 04:09.047
      - What's your name?

04:12.886 --> 04:13.785
          - [Girls] R.

04:15.856 --> 04:16.755
               A.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.260
               Y.

04:22.029 --> 04:22.928
               M.

04:24.832 --> 04:25.731
               O.

04:26.834 --> 04:27.733
               N.

04:29.336 --> 04:30.636
               D.

04:30.638 --> 04:33.538
     - Raymond, that's not
       even a scary name.

04:33.540 --> 04:36.041
  Okay, Ray, what do you want?

04:37.711 --> 04:40.779
      (suspenseful music)

04:54.061 --> 04:56.228
       (glass shattering)

04:56.230 --> 04:57.062
      - Did you hear that?

04:57.064 --> 04:58.263
      - [Heidi] Hear what?

04:58.265 --> 04:59.765
         - I just felt
      something behind me.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.500
      - I thought you said
      you heard something?

05:02.636 --> 05:03.802
            - I did.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.872
      (suspenseful music)

05:10.177 --> 05:13.078
       (thunder roaring)

05:15.482 --> 05:19.284
  (suspenseful chord striking)

05:20.087 --> 05:22.821
        (heavy gasping)

05:24.191 --> 05:25.490
         - What are you
      freaking out about?

05:25.492 --> 05:26.358
     - You didn't see that?

05:26.360 --> 05:27.759
      - [Heidi] See what?

05:27.761 --> 05:29.695
       - There was a man
   standing right behind you!

05:34.868 --> 05:37.169
       - There is no one
       behind me, Gabbie.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.704
Okay, that's just a stupid game.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.406
    I was just doing this to
     get a rise out of you.

05:41.408 --> 05:44.843
        Don't you think
     you're overdramatizing
      this just a little?

05:44.845 --> 05:47.913
      (suspenseful music)

05:55.689 --> 05:56.688
       (Heidi screaming)

05:56.690 --> 06:00.592
 (suspenseful chords striking)

06:01.962 --> 06:03.095
         - Let me out!

06:04.965 --> 06:05.964
          Let me out!

06:18.479 --> 06:21.546
      ("Travel Memories")

06:55.215 --> 06:57.883
         (bell chiming)

07:14.101 --> 07:15.500
        - Hey, heads up.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.303
           - Thanks.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.107
      I should've got you
     more cigarettes while
       you were in there.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.009
- Oh, it's okay I'm sure there's
   still some more in there.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.244
     You can grab some more
     right before we leave.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.781
      - Nah, I'll just bum
       some at the lake.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.317
   - Oh, speaking of are you
 still not coming on the yacht

07:32.319 --> 07:33.452
     with me and Samantha?

07:34.455 --> 07:35.687
    - No, I don't do boats.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.323
    The last thing I need is
     to be seasick all day.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.091
     - Oh, come on, dude, I
  rented it out for everybody.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.426
       It's gonna be fun.

07:41.428 --> 07:42.694
  - None of your daddy's money

07:42.696 --> 07:44.496
      can get me on a boat
      for the entire day.

07:45.399 --> 07:46.298
         - None of it?

07:48.068 --> 07:49.935
        - Well, it would
       have to be a lot.

07:51.472 --> 07:52.704
 - Alright, well, you know what

07:52.706 --> 07:53.939
      if you're not gonna
       come on the yacht,

07:53.941 --> 07:56.441
     then you get to drive
      the rest of the way,

07:56.443 --> 07:59.511
        and I get to bum
       off these all day.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.179
         - Sounds fair.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.714
      ("Travel Memories")

08:02.716 --> 08:04.149
        (birds chirping)

08:04.151 --> 08:06.718
         (dog barking)

08:07.521 --> 08:09.588
     (alarm clock beeping)

08:09.590 --> 08:12.257
         (gentle music)

08:18.866 --> 08:21.766
       (water splashing)

08:51.732 --> 08:52.998
         - Hey, Shaine.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.469
     (hip hop beat blaring
         in headphones)

08:58.772 --> 08:59.671
            Shaine.

09:03.644 --> 09:04.543
            Shaine.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.246
            Shaine!
            - What?

09:08.248 --> 09:10.615
       - Have you seen my
       Barry Dixon book?

09:10.617 --> 09:13.051
      - I don't even know
       what that is, mom.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.587
     - It's the thick white
     interior design book.

09:15.589 --> 09:18.390
   I thought about remodeling
     the upstairs hallway.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.658
        - No, I haven't.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.593
       Did you ask Blake?

09:21.595 --> 09:24.362
    - I'll try calling, but
     I doubt she'll answer.

09:24.364 --> 09:25.430
        - Where is she?

09:25.432 --> 09:28.833
    (train whistle blaring)

09:31.138 --> 09:32.070
      - [Chloe] So are you
      going out to the bar

09:32.072 --> 09:34.072
 with me and Samantha tonight?

09:34.074 --> 09:35.307
 - No, actually 'cause remember

09:35.309 --> 09:38.009
      I'm leaving tomorrow
       to go out of town.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.177
          - Oh, yeah.
            - Yeah.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.112
     - Where are you going?
        - Uh, it's Buna.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.514
     So it's about three or
   four hours north of here.

09:42.516 --> 09:44.783
      I rented a cabin for
       a couple of weeks.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.919
     - You going with like
      family or something?

09:47.921 --> 09:52.290
         - Um, no, it's
      actually to get away

09:52.292 --> 09:53.692
        from the family
      for a little while,

09:53.694 --> 09:55.527
    if you know what I mean.

09:56.463 --> 09:57.362
          - So, wait.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.665
       You got a cabin to
    yourself for two weeks,

10:00.667 --> 10:02.601
        and you weren't
    planning on telling me.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.870
      - I don't know it's
        like a farm, so.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.138
           - A farm?
            - Yeah.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.407
    I just didn't think you
      would be interested.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.010
      - Drakes is a while.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.179
What's something like that cost?

10:14.181 --> 10:17.282
    - Uh, no, I actually got
   a pretty good deal on it.

10:17.284 --> 10:21.186
   The place has been vacant
   for two, three years, so.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.190
     - Yeah, you definitely
    haven't been living here

10:25.192 --> 10:27.525
       long enough if you
   consider that a vacation.

10:28.695 --> 10:30.362
        - Yeah, I know.

10:30.364 --> 10:33.565
    Honestly, it's just for
     some peace and quiet.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.400
       It's kind of what
       I need right now.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.504
  - Yeah, I imagine so moving
    into that creepy house.

10:39.506 --> 10:40.772
        (dramatic music)

10:40.774 --> 10:42.107
      - What do you mean?

10:42.109 --> 10:43.742
- You haven't heard the stories?

10:45.779 --> 10:48.546
  So there's this urban legend
   that we were told as kids

10:48.548 --> 10:51.650
    about a woman in a black
  dress that haunts the house.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.386
  They say her husband had all
   these affairs around town

10:54.388 --> 10:56.688
       that it drove her
        mad, so much so,

10:56.690 --> 10:58.957
that she up and killed herself.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.959
 But that's not the worse part.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.560
        He took off her
       favorite necklace

11:02.562 --> 11:04.295
      that was handed down
      from her grandmother

11:04.297 --> 11:05.764
  while they were burying her,

11:06.867 --> 11:11.102
    and they say anyone who
     has it she kills them.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.539
    - Okay, so what there's
       like a dead woman

11:14.541 --> 11:15.740
      living in my house.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.177
   - Well, technically you're
      living in her house.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.683
- Right, I mean you don't really

11:24.685 --> 11:26.651
        take that stuff
       seriously, do you?

11:27.788 --> 11:29.888
- Like I said just kid stories.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.557
   But I will tell you this.

11:32.559 --> 11:35.760
    That necklace she always
 wore they never recovered it.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.764
   Can imagine what something
      like that is worth?

11:39.766 --> 11:42.167
 - Alright, well, you know what

11:43.203 --> 11:46.805
 if I find it, it's all yours.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.240
     (train wheels roaring)

11:49.242 --> 11:51.843
         (gentle music)

12:06.827 --> 12:10.128
     (tea kettle whistling)

12:38.125 --> 12:40.825
        (soft coughing)

12:40.827 --> 12:41.726
            - What?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.362
       - Thought you said
       you were quitting?

12:45.265 --> 12:46.698
     - This is me quitting.

12:49.503 --> 12:51.136
Thought you were quitting sodas?

12:53.340 --> 12:56.074
       - Well, see, mom,
        I'm in college.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.375
       I don't know what
      you think I used to

12:57.377 --> 12:58.877
  stay up late studying with.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.814
    - Don't come whining to
   me when you get diabetes.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.382
    - Yeah, you are totally
      getting lung cancer

13:04.384 --> 13:06.151
  before I ever get diabetes.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.153
          - Probably.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.789
         (gentle music)

13:37.818 --> 13:38.716
             - Hey.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.720
  What are you doin' out here?

13:42.722 --> 13:43.621
           - Nothing.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.124
- Well, it's gotta be something

13:46.126 --> 13:50.328
     if you're out here in
    the dark and not inside.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.765
      - I'm just not used
      to it here, I guess.

13:54.534 --> 13:55.433
             - Oh.

13:56.636 --> 13:59.504
      Yeah, it's a little
    bit different for sure.

14:01.842 --> 14:04.242
     - He was the only one
    there when I won these.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.248
          - Come here.

14:12.018 --> 14:12.917
        I miss dad too.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.855
    You know it's been hard
     on everybody, Shaine.

14:18.258 --> 14:22.093
 - Please, you've hardly shown
 any emotion since it happened.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.433
  - You just gotta understand

14:29.870 --> 14:32.403
    that we show everything
   in our own way, you know.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.940
     Doesn't mean it hasn't
        affected me too.

14:38.044 --> 14:41.913
   But listen I was thinking,

14:41.915 --> 14:43.915
  and I know we haven't spent
     a lot of time together

14:43.917 --> 14:46.551
 since I got back from school.

14:46.553 --> 14:50.255
    And I was thinking after
   I get back from the cabin,

14:50.257 --> 14:52.690
 I was wondering if me and you

14:52.692 --> 14:57.762
     wanted to do something
    together like old times.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.098
       - Like old types.
             - Yep.

15:02.636 --> 15:04.035
             Yeah.
            - Yeah.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.070
      - Okay, it's a plan.

15:22.889 --> 15:25.690
        (dramatic music)

16:02.996 --> 16:06.531
        (bird squawking)

16:06.533 --> 16:09.334
        (birds chirping)

16:30.123 --> 16:32.757
         (gentle music)

16:36.196 --> 16:37.595
        Home sweet home.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.816
        (dramatic music)

18:02.715 --> 18:05.316
         (gentle music)
        (bird squawking)

18:05.318 --> 18:08.152
        (birds chirping)

18:55.969 --> 18:59.036
      (crickets chirping)

19:25.698 --> 19:28.766
      (cellphone ringing)

19:44.484 --> 19:45.416
             Hello.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.517
   - [Shaine] Hey, what's up?

19:46.519 --> 19:49.187
- Hey, just getting settled in.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.388
      What are you up to?

19:50.390 --> 19:52.557
    - Bored out of my mind.

19:52.559 --> 19:55.193
    Mom is driving me crazy
    with this remodel stuff.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.763
  - Why don't you call up your
    friends and go hang out?

19:58.765 --> 20:00.398
        - All my friends
      are 40 minutes away,

20:00.400 --> 20:02.266
       and I don't have a
       driver's license.

20:03.736 --> 20:07.338
 - Well, I mean, if you want to

20:07.340 --> 20:09.574
    and you can get someone
     to take you over here,

20:09.576 --> 20:11.075
  I can text you the address,

20:11.077 --> 20:13.311
      and you can stay up
      here for a few days.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.780
    - That would be awesome.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.081
        (loud thudding)

20:17.083 --> 20:18.883
        (ominous music)

20:18.885 --> 20:19.784
              Mom.

20:26.826 --> 20:27.792
        Hang on, Blake.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.332
  Mom, will you keep it down?

20:34.334 --> 20:35.499
       I'm on the phone.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.338
         (gentle music)

20:44.611 --> 20:45.476
              Mom?

20:47.280 --> 20:48.913
      Mom, are you there?

21:00.126 --> 21:03.261
     (dark dramatic music)

21:06.532 --> 21:08.666
         (gentle music)

21:08.668 --> 21:10.434
        Okay, I'm back.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.069
- Is everything okay over there?

21:12.071 --> 21:14.939
 - Yeah, I think there's a cat
   in the attic or something.

21:16.776 --> 21:17.775
         - Oh, my god.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.778
      I'm so glad I don't
       have to be home--

21:20.780 --> 21:23.080
  (cellphone signal breaking)
         (voice fading)

21:23.082 --> 21:23.981
            - Blake.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.321
  - Alright, hang on, Shaine.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.289
       My phone's dying.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.863
   - Blake, can you hear me?

21:40.133 --> 21:41.365
     Hello, are you there--

21:41.367 --> 21:44.535
      (cellphone chirping)

21:54.981 --> 21:55.846
            - Hello.

22:18.371 --> 22:20.938
         (tense music)

22:40.093 --> 22:42.893
        (metal scraping)

22:45.231 --> 22:46.130
             Hello.

22:57.744 --> 23:01.112
    (ominous chord striking)

23:01.114 --> 23:06.150
         (gentle music)
      (microwave beeping)

23:47.226 --> 23:50.127
       (heavy breathing)

23:52.598 --> 23:54.231
      - That was amazing.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.303
       - Aren't I always?

23:59.305 --> 24:02.273
      (cellphone chiming)

24:07.046 --> 24:07.945
          Who's that?

24:09.248 --> 24:10.548
           - Nobody.

24:10.550 --> 24:11.515
       Phone bill's late.

24:12.919 --> 24:13.851
     I'm a get some water.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.419
  You want anything to drink?

24:15.421 --> 24:16.720
        - No, I'm good.

24:20.226 --> 24:22.960
        (alert chiming)

24:39.846 --> 24:42.913
      (cellphone chiming)

24:58.698 --> 25:01.565
(bar patrons voices overlapping)

25:01.567 --> 25:03.667
     - I really have to get
     out of this town, Sam.

25:03.669 --> 25:06.203
      I can't keep dodging
    these eviction notices.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.739
       - Well, come work
      with me at Spanky's.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.875
        - Excuse me, but
      I'm not a stripper.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.677
        - Neither am I.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.746
  - Bartending around a bunch
   of naked bitches all night

25:15.748 --> 25:19.149
     while they make money,
      not my idea of fun.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.552
     - Well, why don't you
      move in with Tommy?

25:21.554 --> 25:23.187
     - Why would I do that?

25:23.189 --> 25:25.189
    - Aren't y'all a thing?

25:25.191 --> 25:28.125
      - When have you ever
   known me to be into Tommy?

25:28.127 --> 25:30.194
   - Haven't y'all hooked up?

25:30.196 --> 25:32.296
    - Once or twice doesn't
        make us a thing.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.933
         - Well, shit.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.501
    Short of robbing a bank,

25:37.503 --> 25:40.371
 I don't know how you're gonna
  make any money around here.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.741
  - Holy shit, that's genius.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.709
- What, you're gonna rob a bank?

25:45.711 --> 25:47.811
   - No, no, of course, not.

25:47.813 --> 25:49.847
      I'm gonna rob Blake.

25:49.849 --> 25:52.316
    - Whoa, whoa, whoa wait.

25:52.318 --> 25:53.183
             Blake!

25:53.185 --> 25:54.518
        - Yeah, why not?

25:54.520 --> 25:56.120
      She's loaded, right?

25:56.122 --> 25:58.522
    And she just moved into
     the old Hugh's house.

25:58.524 --> 26:01.125
        - Right, but you
      and I are basically

26:01.127 --> 26:03.327
      the only two people
     she knows around here.

26:03.329 --> 26:05.195
Plus, we both know she's loaded.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.400
     - What about that guy
    that your step-dad hired

26:09.402 --> 26:11.569
        to take care of
      that thing for him?

26:12.572 --> 26:13.604
       - What about him?

26:14.774 --> 26:15.873
       - Can he help us?

26:17.109 --> 26:19.510
       - Well, I can ask,

26:19.512 --> 26:23.080
     but I don't recommend
   getting involved with him.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.182
  - He's just helping us out.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.383
       We get the money.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.085
    He takes care of Blake.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.853
         He gets a cut.

26:29.855 --> 26:32.056
    We walk away scot-free,

26:32.058 --> 26:33.524
    and I leave this place.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.293
      - Now we're getting
         rid of Blake?

26:39.498 --> 26:40.965
     - Occupational hazard.

26:42.301 --> 26:46.036
- Well, if you think it'll work.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.504
       - Oh, it'll work.

26:48.307 --> 26:51.375
      (crickets chirping)

26:53.613 --> 26:56.847
     (wind chimes ringing)

27:00.953 --> 27:04.054

        (loud thudding)

28:49.061 --> 28:51.895
        (dramatic music)

29:22.595 --> 29:23.494
            - Shit.

29:38.911 --> 29:41.278
         (gentle music)

29:41.280 --> 29:43.013
 So that's where she put them.

30:00.065 --> 30:02.900
        (dramatic music)

30:30.696 --> 30:33.497
        (dramatic music)

30:56.355 --> 30:58.956
         (gentle music)

31:15.908 --> 31:19.142
     (dark dramatic music)

31:28.287 --> 31:29.186
             Whoa.

31:53.412 --> 31:57.180
  (suspenseful music swelling)

32:00.853 --> 32:03.287
      - [Mom] Hey, Shaine,
    can you come downstairs?

32:03.289 --> 32:06.456
       - I'm coming hang
       on just a second.

32:11.897 --> 32:14.564
         (upbeat music)

32:26.779 --> 32:29.413
         (bright music)

32:49.668 --> 32:52.436
        (birds chirping)

33:20.132 --> 33:25.202
        (dramatic music)
    (swing ropes squeaking)

33:38.050 --> 33:43.120
    (swing robes squeaking)
         (tense music)

33:43.789 --> 33:46.623
       (thunder roaring)

33:55.734 --> 33:58.769
      (mellow bass music)

34:36.074 --> 34:39.976
 (TV channel static crackling)

34:50.621 --> 34:53.422
        (dramatic music)

35:30.762 --> 35:33.663
       (thunder roaring)

35:41.473 --> 35:42.372
            - Shit.

35:49.448 --> 35:50.914
            - Damn.

35:50.916 --> 35:53.283
    Jason, said the power's
     out in three counties.

35:54.620 --> 35:55.685
      - It's not out here.

36:02.494 --> 36:03.393
            - Chloe.

36:04.997 --> 36:06.463
             Chloe.
            - What?

36:06.465 --> 36:07.764
   - What are we doin' here?

36:08.834 --> 36:12.469
              - We
  (dramatic orchestral music)

36:12.471 --> 36:13.803
     aren't doing anything?

36:13.805 --> 36:15.338
      - Whoa, whoa, wait.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.441
       I thought you said
        you were gonna.

36:20.045 --> 36:21.044
         - Gonna what?

36:22.214 --> 36:23.180
          - You know?

36:26.418 --> 36:27.984
           - Really.
            - What?

36:27.986 --> 36:30.620
- Keep thinking with your dick,
  and see where that gets you.

36:33.659 --> 36:36.560
        (dramatic music)

36:43.035 --> 36:45.936
       (thunder roaring)

36:49.775 --> 36:51.274
         - No service.

36:52.778 --> 36:54.211
          No service.

36:55.847 --> 36:56.813
          No service.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.249
           Fantastic.

37:01.186 --> 37:06.256
        (door creaking)

       (heavy breathing)

       (thunder roaring)
        (dramatic music)

41:42.501 --> 41:43.766
          - Seriously.

41:43.768 --> 41:44.701
       Where's the money?

42:07.726 --> 42:08.625
             Bingo.

42:14.099 --> 42:16.900
        (dramatic music)

42:21.973 --> 42:22.906
         Sorry, honey.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.809
       Had to get rid of
        your booty call.

42:36.254 --> 42:39.322
      (cellphone ringing)

42:45.664 --> 42:46.596
            - Hello.

42:46.598 --> 42:48.231
   - Hey, how was the search?

42:48.233 --> 42:50.033
     Did you find anything
         in the house?

42:51.903 --> 42:53.236
   - Not as much as I needed.

42:54.406 --> 42:55.505
     Any word on your end?

42:56.942 --> 42:59.375
   - Yeah, the guy is on his
   way to take care of Blake,

42:59.377 --> 43:02.779
     but we really need to
    have that money for him.

43:02.781 --> 43:04.480
       - And if we don't?

43:04.482 --> 43:05.982
         - If we don't!

43:05.984 --> 43:08.618
      This isn't a guy you
     wanna play games with.

43:08.620 --> 43:10.053
        If we don't have
       something for him

43:10.055 --> 43:11.921
   after already hiring him,

43:11.923 --> 43:13.856
        he's gonna come
       after both of us.

43:17.796 --> 43:19.596
    - I'm gonna go up there.

43:19.598 --> 43:22.899
  - [Samantha] Chloe, I don't
   think that's a smart idea.

43:22.901 --> 43:25.401
       - What's the worst
       that could happen?

43:25.403 --> 43:28.271
       - Um, he finds you
       without his money,

43:28.273 --> 43:31.341
 and he comes after both of us.

43:31.343 --> 43:33.576
       I'm stuck in this
      with you too, Chloe.

43:33.578 --> 43:35.478
  - Don't be so melodramatic.

43:35.480 --> 43:36.846
   I can take care of myself.

43:41.453 --> 43:43.419
      - [Samantha] So what
       are you gonna do?

43:44.756 --> 43:46.255
 - I'm gonna go get our money.

43:47.292 --> 43:50.526
    (swing chains squeaking)
       (thunder rumbling)

43:50.528 --> 43:53.329
        (dramatic music)

44:19.724 --> 44:21.257
            - Shit.

44:21.259 --> 44:22.158
            Come on.

44:24.696 --> 44:25.595
             Shit.

44:27.866 --> 44:30.667
        (dramatic music)

44:57.095 --> 44:59.896
        (door squeaking)

45:23.922 --> 45:25.254
            Dammit.

45:38.870 --> 45:42.672
  (suspenseful chord striking)

45:50.949 --> 45:53.616
     - [Danielle] This way.

45:53.618 --> 45:56.452
        (rain splashing)

46:06.464 --> 46:09.999
    (rocking chair creaking)

46:10.001 --> 46:12.802

        (heavy gasping)

47:30.682 --> 47:31.914
             - Hey!

47:31.916 --> 47:33.349
       Hey, I know you're
        there, come on.

47:48.933 --> 47:52.001
      (suspenseful music)

47:58.376 --> 48:02.211
 (suspenseful chords striking)

48:10.021 --> 48:13.089
      (crickets chirping)

48:15.059 --> 48:17.860
        (dramatic music)

49:16.621 --> 49:17.687
          Fuck is she?

49:18.456 --> 49:21.524
      (crickets chirping)

50:14.445 --> 50:15.344
            - Hello.

50:20.318 --> 50:21.484
         Anybody home?

50:46.310 --> 50:47.176
             Hello.

50:53.985 --> 50:55.084
         Anybody here?

51:29.887 --> 51:30.786
             Shit.

51:34.092 --> 51:36.892
        (dramatic music)

52:03.654 --> 52:04.553
             Blake.

52:06.991 --> 52:07.990
          It's Chloe.

52:18.035 --> 52:18.934
             Blake.

52:54.939 --> 52:57.540
         (girl sobbing)

53:10.054 --> 53:10.953
             - Hey.

53:12.890 --> 53:15.591
       It's okay. I'm not
        gonna hurt you.

53:19.463 --> 53:21.197
        My name's Blake,
       what's your name?

53:24.869 --> 53:26.635
         Is this yours?

53:26.637 --> 53:28.938
    Yeah, you want it back?

53:31.209 --> 53:32.508
       It's okay, I'm not
        gonna hurt you.

53:32.510 --> 53:33.542
        You can have it.

53:41.018 --> 53:42.184
       What's your name?

53:43.721 --> 53:44.620
          - Danielle.

53:46.190 --> 53:48.657
- Danielle, huh, that's pretty.

53:50.328 --> 53:52.895
     What are you doing out
  here in the rain, Danielle?

53:55.666 --> 53:57.166
     - It's not safe here.

54:00.838 --> 54:02.471
       - Do you know what
  happened to the two sisters

54:02.473 --> 54:04.240
        that lived here
       a few years back?

54:05.009 --> 54:08.410
       (thunder roaring)

54:08.412 --> 54:10.112
    - They brought her here.

54:10.114 --> 54:12.748
       They used the game
     and brought her back.

54:16.454 --> 54:16.986
          - What game?

54:16.987 --> 54:17.519
       - [Danielle] They
      sent them a message

54:17.521 --> 54:19.088
 with the letters on the floor.

54:22.493 --> 54:23.692
       - Are you talking
       about the Ouija--

54:23.694 --> 54:25.628
     - Don't say its name!

54:25.630 --> 54:28.397
    You should never say its
 name, nor play with its evil.

54:29.934 --> 54:31.800
- I don't understand, Danielle.

54:34.171 --> 54:35.804
        - Burn the game.

54:53.090 --> 54:54.890
       - Are you fucking
     kidding me right now?

55:07.371 --> 55:08.504
         - She's back.

55:11.676 --> 55:13.442
   - Who's back, who is she?

55:16.814 --> 55:21.884
 - She is bad, very, very bad.

55:22.420 --> 55:25.154
        (ominous music)

55:54.585 --> 55:57.486
        (dramatic music)

56:47.104 --> 56:48.837
             - Boo.
         (soft gasping)

56:48.839 --> 56:50.205
   - What are you doing here?

56:53.544 --> 56:54.877
   - Let's cut the bullshit.

56:55.980 --> 56:57.813
       I need to get what
        I came here for.

56:57.815 --> 57:00.048
     You're my only ticket
       out of this town.

57:00.050 --> 57:01.283
 - What are you talking about?

57:01.285 --> 57:02.151
       Please put that--

57:02.153 --> 57:03.919
      - The money, Blake.

57:03.921 --> 57:05.854
      You're the only one
       here that has any.

57:07.224 --> 57:08.924
   - Money, I mean, I have a
  hundred bucks in my wallet.

57:08.926 --> 57:10.459
          (gun firing)
         Fucking hell!

57:10.461 --> 57:12.161
       I can go get that
       for you right now.

57:12.163 --> 57:14.563
    - That's not the kind of
 money that I'm talking about.

57:15.666 --> 57:17.466
       - Okay, I can get
        you to the car.

57:17.468 --> 57:18.734
     We can go to the ATM.

57:18.736 --> 57:20.702
      I can get you cash.
             - No.

57:20.704 --> 57:22.638
  This is what we're gonna do.

57:22.640 --> 57:25.774
      (footsteps creaking)

57:33.517 --> 57:34.416
         What was that?

57:36.420 --> 57:39.488
      (suspenseful music)

57:48.866 --> 57:49.998
          (gun firing)

58:20.698 --> 58:23.499
        (dramatic music)

58:32.743 --> 58:34.977
   I know somebody's up here.

58:40.484 --> 58:41.450
       This isn't funny.

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:08.170
            - What?

01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:09.471
        Oh, no, no, no.

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:15.510

      know what you mean?

   don't like to hurt women,

     but if you don't tell
       me where Chloe is,

  I might get a little angry.

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:53.274

    screaming from the barn,

01:06:53.276 --> 01:06:55.844
     and I went over there.

01:06:55.846 --> 01:06:58.813

        There's strange
     things going on here.

01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:05.186
       We have to get out
       of here. (sobbing)

01:07:07.457 --> 01:07:08.757
   - Let me tell you a story

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:11.126
 that you probably don't know.

01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:17.032
      You see, your friend
     Chloe she played you,

01:07:18.135 --> 01:07:20.168
      went to your house,
     and now she's missing,

01:07:22.172 --> 01:07:23.338
  and you're running off like

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:25.240
         you've seen a
      ghost or something.

01:07:25.242 --> 01:07:28.276
     - I'm telling I don't
      know where Chloe is.

01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:30.578
         I don't know.

01:07:32.115 --> 01:07:37.185
    I don't know. (sobbing)

01:07:37.854 --> 01:07:39.054
    Just let me go, please.

01:07:40.357 --> 01:07:41.556
            Please.

01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:43.358
        - You and I both
      know I can't do that

01:07:44.161 --> 01:07:45.860
 not after you've seen my face,

01:07:47.197 --> 01:07:51.900
  so I'm going to ask you one
    more time where's Chloe?

01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:57.338
        (dramatic music)

01:07:59.042 --> 01:08:00.008
         - She's gone.

01:08:06.316 --> 01:08:07.816
        If Samantha had
       stolen any money,

01:08:07.818 --> 01:08:10.685
    she sure as shit didn't
   tell me where they put it!

01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:14.289
    - You're probably right.

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:17.792
   But unfortunately for you

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:21.229
        I drove out here
       to get something.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.267
        (Blake gasping)

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:29.671
    (soft knocking on door)

01:08:43.553 --> 01:08:46.688
      (suspenseful music)

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:55.363
  (suspenseful chord striking)

01:08:55.365 --> 01:08:57.198
    I think we're gonna have
   to postpone our engagement

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.334
   just a little bit longer.

01:09:01.872 --> 01:09:03.438
 Don't you worry, sweet cheeks.

01:09:06.343 --> 01:09:07.242
         I'll be back.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.033
        (dramatic music)

01:10:49.879 --> 01:10:52.413
 That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:10:55.885 --> 01:10:58.653
        (dramatic music)

01:12:11.127 --> 01:12:13.861
        (ominous music)

01:12:17.167 --> 01:12:20.468
      (crickets chirping)

01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:23.304
        (dramatic music)

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:24.732
       (thunder rumbling)

01:13:33.476 --> 01:13:36.210
        (ominous music)

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:52.160
      (suspenseful music)

01:13:52.162 --> 01:13:54.896
        (Blake gasping)

01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:08.843
       (heavy breathing)

01:14:08.845 --> 01:14:11.579
        (Blake gasping)

01:14:42.545 --> 01:14:46.380
  (suspenseful music swelling)

01:14:59.596 --> 01:15:02.363
        (loud screaming)

01:15:23.286 --> 01:15:26.721

01:15:26.723 --> 01:15:29.524
        (birds chirping)

01:16:38.561 --> 01:16:41.195
         (soft sobbing)

01:17:25.108 --> 01:17:28.275
      (truck horn honking)

01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:44.025
         (gentle music)

01:18:17.193 --> 01:18:18.092
            - Blake.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:25.766
             Blake.

01:18:37.113 --> 01:18:40.014
        (dramatic music)

01:18:59.135 --> 01:19:02.470
    ("You Are My Sunshine")

    ¶ The other night dear,
      as I lay sleeping ¶

01:19:09.712 --> 01:19:14.715

        you in my arms ¶

01:19:15.818 --> 01:19:20.888
     ¶ When I awoke, dear,
        I was mistaken ¶

01:19:23.726 --> 01:19:28.796
    ¶ The other night dear,
      as I lay sleeping ¶

01:19:30.032 --> 01:19:35.102

        you in my arms ¶

01:19:36.372 --> 01:19:41.442
     ¶ When I awoke, dear,
        I was mistaken ¶

      ¶ When I awoke dear,
        I was mistaken ¶
