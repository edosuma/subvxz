WEBVTT

00:06.906 --> 00:10.275
AND TURN.
AND TURN.

00:10.277 --> 00:13.545
- AND TURN.  AND TURN.
- AND STOP.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.281
LIV, I'M NOT
YOUR PERSONAL SUPERMODEL.

00:16.283 --> 00:18.584
OH, MADDIE,
I NEVER SAID YOU WERE.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.552
YOU ARE MY 3-D MIRROR.

00:20.554 --> 00:25.057
WELL, YOUR 3-D MIRROR
IS ABOUT TO QUIT.

00:25.059 --> 00:27.226
I HAVE A BIG GAME AGAINST
THE GRIZZLIES THIS WEEK

00:27.228 --> 00:28.660
AND THESE FEET NEED
TO BE ON A BASKETBALL COURT.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.963
- SO...
- AH!  NEED I REMIND YOU

00:30.965 --> 00:33.032
THAT THIS LITTLE
FASHION SESH IS PAYBACK

00:33.034 --> 00:34.867
FOR YOU TOSSING
MY FAVORITE CASHMERE SWEATER

00:34.869 --> 00:38.103
IN THE LAUNDRY.

00:38.105 --> 00:39.805
( chuckles )
OKAY.

00:39.807 --> 00:42.241
WHY DO GIRLS GET SO EXCITED
ABOUT SHOES?

00:42.243 --> 00:44.243
I MEAN, THEY'RE JUST THINGS
TO PUT ON YOUR FEET

00:44.245 --> 00:46.645
SO THAT IF YOU STEP IN DOG POOP
YOU DON'T GET HOOKWORM.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.280
( both gasp )

00:48.282 --> 00:49.915
MADDIE, THE RIGHT
PAIR OF HEELS

00:49.917 --> 00:51.884
CAN MAKE A GIRL
FEEL MAGICAL.

00:51.886 --> 00:55.621
AND HER MOTHER
WHEN SHE BORROWS THEM.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.792
STOP.

00:59.794 --> 01:02.361
WHY ARE YOU
DRAGGING TREE BRANCHES
THROUGH THE HOUSE?

01:02.363 --> 01:05.564
GOING THROUGH THE HOUSE
INSTEAD OF AROUND

01:05.566 --> 01:09.735
GETS US TO THE WOOD CHIPPER
27 STEPS FASTER.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.036
PLUS WE CAN
STOP IN THE KITCHEN

01:11.038 --> 01:13.572
FOR A NICE, COLD GLASS
OF LEMONADE.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.140
RIGHT.
IT ALSO CREATES

01:15.142 --> 01:18.277
A TRAIL OF LEAVES FOR
SOMEONE TO CLEAN UP LATER.

01:18.279 --> 01:22.714
Both: OH.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.616
( clears throat )
OKAY, WELL,

01:24.618 --> 01:26.718
LET'S-- LET'S WRAP THIS UP.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.320
COME ON, MADDIE,
THERE'S NOT EVEN

01:28.322 --> 01:30.089
A LITTLE PART OF YOU
THAT'S ENJOYING THIS?

01:30.091 --> 01:32.758
OH, HOLD ON, LIV.
LET ME CHECK REAL QUICK.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.027
UM... NO.

01:36.362 --> 01:37.863
SERIOUSLY?

01:37.865 --> 01:39.298
OKAY,
YOU CAN'T WEAR SNEAKERS

01:39.300 --> 01:40.599
FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE, MADDIE.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.900
YOU KNOW WHAT--

01:41.902 --> 01:44.336
YOU NEED TO TAP INTO
YOUR INNER SPARKLE.

01:45.371 --> 01:48.874
FEAST YOUR FOUR EYES...

01:48.876 --> 01:51.376
- ON THESE!
- ( hyperventilating )

01:53.046 --> 01:55.614
( exhales )
I HAVE FOUND

01:55.616 --> 01:57.082
THE PERFECT PUMPS.

01:57.084 --> 01:58.684
OH!  IT'S AS IF
YOU WERE WALKING AROUND

01:58.686 --> 02:00.319
IN A BOWL OF
HIGH-FASHION PUDDING.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.954
OKAY, OKAY, ENOUGH.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.288
I WILL TRY THEM ON.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.857
( clears throat )

02:04.859 --> 02:06.258
OKAY, JUST BE CAREFUL,
'CAUSE IF YOU STRETCH 'EM

02:06.260 --> 02:08.327
I CAN'T WEAR 'EM.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.629
YOU GUYS
HAVE TEN SECONDS.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.630
LOOK QUICK.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.333
10, 9, 8--

02:14.335 --> 02:17.769
<i>( twinkling )</i>

02:17.771 --> 02:19.304
( sighs )

02:19.306 --> 02:21.306
WHOA, MAMA.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.242
HELLO, INNER SPARKLE.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.310
I LOVE THESE SHOES.
( laughs )

02:25.312 --> 02:27.379
I HATE THESE SHOES.

02:30.049 --> 02:32.985
WELL, YOU CAN LEAD
A TOMBOY TO DESIGNER SHOES

02:32.987 --> 02:34.419
BUT YOU CAN'T
MAKE HER SHIMMER.

02:34.421 --> 02:37.289

03:27.440 --> 03:29.741
HERE YOU GO,
MRS. ROONEY.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.843
I BAKED FRESH MUFFINS.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.846
MY BUDDY EVAN
IS THE PERFECT HOUSEGUEST.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.348
HE MAKES HIS BED.
HE GETS THE PAPER.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.783
HE BAKES FRESH MUFFINS.

03:37.785 --> 03:41.286
AND DOES IT ALL WITH A SMILE
ON THAT SWEET, FRECKLY FACE.

03:41.288 --> 03:44.289
HE'S REALLY MAKING ME
LOOK BAD.

03:46.292 --> 03:47.392
WELL, THANK YOU, EVAN.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.295
I AM NOT USED
TO ALL THIS ATTENTION.

03:50.297 --> 03:51.863
AHEM.

03:55.368 --> 03:56.468
BLESS YOU?

03:59.105 --> 04:01.573
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU LETTING ME STAY HERE

04:01.575 --> 04:03.442
WHILE MY MOM'S
AT A CONVENTION.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.043
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
A FEW MINUTES FOR YOURSELF

04:05.045 --> 04:06.311
AND I'LL CLEAN UP HERE?

04:06.313 --> 04:08.447
YOU ARE LIKE A DREAM.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.782
PARKER, YOU COULD
LEARN A LITTLE SOMETHING

04:10.784 --> 04:13.318
FROM YOUR FRIEND.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.388
DUDE, WE GOTTA TALK.

04:18.157 --> 04:20.826
GREAT!  MY MOM SAYS
TALKING IS THE BEST WAY

04:20.828 --> 04:22.160
TO UNBURDEN YOUR SOUL.

04:23.463 --> 04:25.297
I TOTALLY GET YOU'RE
TRYING TO BE HELPFUL,

04:25.299 --> 04:27.466
BUT THE MORE YOU DO
FOR MY MOM,

04:27.468 --> 04:29.868
THE MORE SHE'LL EXPECT
FROM ME.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.837
I GOT A GOOD THING
GOING HERE.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.305
AND I DON'T NEED YOU
WALTZING IN

04:33.307 --> 04:36.008
AND RUINING IT!

04:36.010 --> 04:39.211
MY MOM SAYS BEING HELPFUL
IS A RAY OF LIGHT

04:39.213 --> 04:41.113
I CAN JUST SHINE
ON OUR HAPPY HOME.

04:41.115 --> 04:43.882
NOT TRUE.

04:43.884 --> 04:47.519
THE GOAL IS
TO GET OUT OF CHORES.

04:48.988 --> 04:50.322
PFFT.

04:50.324 --> 04:53.325
PARKER, YOU'RE HILARIOUS.

04:54.827 --> 04:57.496
OH, WAIT, YOU'RE SERIOUS?

04:57.498 --> 04:59.531
IF YOUR PARENTS THINK

04:59.533 --> 05:01.400
THAT YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE
OF DOING ANYTHING,

05:01.402 --> 05:04.236
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO DO
ANOTHER CHORE AGAIN.

05:04.238 --> 05:05.370
( gasps )

05:05.372 --> 05:08.173
DOES SUCH A WORLD EXIST?!

05:08.175 --> 05:09.474
IT DOES.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.209
LET ME SHOW YOU
A WAY.

05:11.211 --> 05:13.478
A BETTER WAY.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.480
THE PARKER WAY.

05:23.089 --> 05:25.257
C-PLUS?

05:25.259 --> 05:27.392
IN GYM?

05:30.063 --> 05:31.330
DAD.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.332
HA!
LOVING FATHER MAN

05:33.334 --> 05:35.901
WHO WEARS THE WHISTLE.

05:35.903 --> 05:39.137
IF I DON'T KEEP
MY PERFECT G.P.A.,

05:39.139 --> 05:41.139
I WILL NEVER
BE VALEDICTORIAN.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.375
AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING
A LOT OF SMACK

05:43.377 --> 05:46.278
IN ROBOTICS CLUB.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.880
SO HAS THE SMACK-TALKING
ROBOT I BUILT.

05:48.882 --> 05:52.150
SORRY, SON, BUT I
HAD TO MARK YOU DOWN

05:52.152 --> 05:53.552
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T FINISH
YOUR SHUTTLE RUN

05:53.554 --> 05:55.320
IN UNDER 35 SECONDS.

05:55.322 --> 05:59.524
35 SECONDS?
DADDY, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.259
OH, YEAH?

06:01.261 --> 06:03.128
HEY, DIGGIE.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.463
WE'RE GO FOR SHUTTLE RUN.

06:06.132 --> 06:09.201
TIMER STARTS NOW.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.936
IF YOU WANT, I CAN
GIVE YOU A RETEST,

06:10.938 --> 06:12.471
BUT YOU'RE ONLY GOING
TO GET ONE SHOT AT IT.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.473
Joey:  <i>YOU'RE TELLING ME</i>
<i>THE ONLY WAY</i>

06:14.475 --> 06:15.907
I'M GOING TO BE
VALEDICTORIAN

06:15.909 --> 06:17.409
IS IF I SCURRY
ACROSS THE GYM FLOOR

06:17.411 --> 06:19.344
LIKE A JOCK-ROACH.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.446
I DON'T MAKE
THE RULES, SON.

06:21.448 --> 06:22.514
I JUST BLOW THE WHISTLE.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.016
ALSO, I TEACH
HEALTH CLASS.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.419
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT YOUR CHANGING BODY,

06:27.421 --> 06:29.321
MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN.

06:29.323 --> 06:33.058
YEAH, LET'S KEEP
THAT DOOR CLOSED.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.326
DONE!

06:34.328 --> 06:36.027
NICE SHUTTLE RUN, DIGGIE.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.964
28.7 SECONDS.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.899
I DON'T THINK
ANY LESS OF YOU, SON.

06:42.969 --> 06:45.070
HEY!

06:45.072 --> 06:47.005
DIGGIE.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.107
MY FAVORITE
VARSITY ATHLETE

06:49.109 --> 06:53.545
AND THE ONLY ONE
WHO HAS NEVER PURPLED
MY NURPLES.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.013
I NEED A FAVOR.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.315
I NEED TO DO THE SHUTTLE RUN
IN UNDER 35 SECONDS.

06:57.317 --> 06:58.617
OH, SO YOU WANT ME
TO TRAIN YOU?

06:58.619 --> 07:00.318
- I'D BE HAPPY TO.
- ACTUALLY,

07:00.320 --> 07:03.288
I WAS THINKING
YOU'D DO IT FOR ME.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.023
I'D GIVE YOU SOME GLASSES.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.324
SOME FANCY TUBE SOCKS.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.493
JOEY, NO OFFENSE,

07:08.495 --> 07:10.362
BUT NO ONE'S GOING
TO BELIEVE THAT I'M YOU.

07:10.364 --> 07:12.631
YOU KNOW WHAT--
YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:12.633 --> 07:15.033
WHY DID I HAVE TO BE
BORN SO HANDSOME?

07:21.474 --> 07:23.141
OH, HEY.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.610
HEARD YOU WEREN'T FEELING
VERY WELL.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.512
OH, YEAH.
MUST BE A BUG OR SOMETHING.

07:27.514 --> 07:28.947
MM, WELL,
I HOPE YOU'LL BE OKAY

07:28.949 --> 07:30.682
FOR THE GAME AGAINST
THE GRIZZLIES TOMORROW.

07:30.684 --> 07:33.051
I'M PRETTY SURE I'LL BE FINE
AFTER A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.053
MM-HMM.
CAN I GET YOU SOME GINGER ALE?

07:35.055 --> 07:37.389
OR SOME CRACKERS?

07:37.391 --> 07:40.025
UM, NO, I'M--
I'M FINE.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.327
I'M ALSO OVER HERE.

07:42.329 --> 07:43.495
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

07:43.497 --> 07:45.397
OH!
( chuckles )

07:45.399 --> 07:47.032
A FEVER.

07:49.402 --> 07:50.602
AWW!

07:52.705 --> 07:54.072
HEY, MOM.
MOM.

07:54.074 --> 07:57.409
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR LIV'S
PERFECT PUMPS, AREN'T YOU?

07:57.411 --> 08:01.413
NO, I-- I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT THEM.

08:01.415 --> 08:04.082
I WANT TO SLIP 'EM ON.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.685
EVEN JUST A TOE.
I JUST NEED A TASTE.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.621
MM, YEAH, WELL,

08:09.623 --> 08:11.156
THEY'RE ACTUALLY
NOT IN HERE.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.457
I JUST SAW LIV
COMING AND LOOKING FOR THEM.

08:12.459 --> 08:15.327
SO IF I SEE THEM,
I WILL LET YOU KNOW.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.329
BUT-- HEY, MOM.
IN THE MEANTIME,

08:17.331 --> 08:20.732
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SLIP ON
A SIZE 10 DOSE OF DIGNITY.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.200
YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.602
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO ME.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.437
IF YOU TELL LIV I WAS HERE,
AND YOU WILL BE--

08:25.439 --> 08:27.506
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

08:31.377 --> 08:35.647
HI, GIRLS.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.349
I JUST LIED TO MY MOM.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.251
ABOUT SHOES.

08:39.253 --> 08:41.453
<i>( twinkling )</i>

08:45.124 --> 08:47.459
HA!
AND I DON'T EVEN CARE.

08:50.396 --> 08:53.598
AND THIS IS MY LOCKER.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.202
( gasps )
HIDE, GIRLS.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.237
OH, HI, MADDIE.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.372
I'M GLAD
YOU'RE FEELING BETTER.

09:00.374 --> 09:02.173
WHAT?  OH.  YEAH.
( coughs )

09:02.175 --> 09:03.375
WAY BETTER.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.410
UM...

09:05.412 --> 09:07.078
OH, WOW.
YOU KNOW WHAT--

09:07.080 --> 09:10.649
TRYING TO WORK THROUGH
AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE
AROUND THE CORNER.

09:10.651 --> 09:11.816
I'M COMING.
MAKE WAY.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.351
THERAPIST COMING THROUGH!

09:13.353 --> 09:15.453
ROONEY.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.222
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
YESTERDAY?

09:17.224 --> 09:18.423
WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO MEET FOR FRO-YO.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.358
YOU DIDN'T SHOW-YO.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.194
HAD TO GET IT TO GO-YO.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.730
UH, YEAH.
DIDN'T YOU GET MY TEXT?

09:25.732 --> 09:28.400
WELL, YEAH, BUT--
"CAN'T COME.  GOT A THING."

09:28.402 --> 09:31.369
IS NOT ALL THAT
INFORMATIVE.

09:31.371 --> 09:34.139
DID YOU GET TALLER?

09:34.141 --> 09:36.241
NO.  YES.  MAYBE.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.376
( stammers )
MAYBE YOU'RE TALLER.

09:40.446 --> 09:42.080
HEY, GUYS.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.214
MADDIE,
YOU LOOK DIFFERENT.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.382
MAYBE YOU'RE TALLER!

09:44.384 --> 09:45.584
OKAY...

09:50.122 --> 09:51.523
OKAY, THAT WAS WEIRD,
RIGHT?

09:51.525 --> 09:54.859
I KNOW WEIRD,
AND THAT WAS IT.

09:54.861 --> 09:58.263
BUT SHE'S BEEN ACTING
WEIRD ALL DAY.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.198
SHE EVEN SKIPPED
HER MORNING WORKOUT.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.633
THAT'S SO NOT LIKE HER.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.768
WAIT, HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?
SHE WORKS OUT AT 5:00 A.M.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.437
I WAS UP DOING
THE DRILLS YOU TAUGHT ME

10:05.439 --> 10:07.238
- FOR MY SHUTTLE RUN RETEST.
- REALLY?

10:07.240 --> 10:10.175
NOPE.  I WAS UP READING
A BOOK ABOUT DRAGONS.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.778
- HEY, JOEY.
- WILLOW!

10:13.780 --> 10:15.413
( screams )

10:16.449 --> 10:19.651
WOW.  I'VE NEVER
SEEN HIM RUN BEFORE.

10:19.653 --> 10:22.354
THAT'S WEIRD.
I ONLY SEE HIM RUN.

10:25.524 --> 10:27.525
OKAY, WHEN MY MOM COMES IN,

10:27.527 --> 10:29.361
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

10:29.363 --> 10:31.429
LOWER HER EXPECTATIONS.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.465
EXACTLY.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.534
GET READY TO EXPERIENCE
THE PARKER WAY IN ACTION.

10:36.536 --> 10:40.372
- HEY, MRS. ROONEY.
- OH.

10:40.374 --> 10:42.574
I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT
TO DO AROUND HERE.

10:42.576 --> 10:45.677
SO I UNLOADED
THE DISHWASHER FOR YOU.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.345
WELL, THANK YOU, EVAN.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.547
OH, BUT THOSE DISHES
WERE DIRTY.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.249
THEY SEEMED A LITTLE CRUSTY.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.451
BUT I'M NOT HERE TO JUDGE
HOW YOU KEEP HOUSE, MA'AM.

11:00.559 --> 11:02.927
SORRY, MRS. ROONEY.

11:02.929 --> 11:05.430
LET ME HELP YOU.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.801
( gasps )

11:09.803 --> 11:11.469
OOPS.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.838
COME ON, EVAN.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.907
BE A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.179
OOPS.

11:22.381 --> 11:25.550
LOOKS LIKE I CAUGHT
THE CLUMSIES FROM EVAN.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.218
BOYS, PLEASE STOP.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.788
I FEEL TERRIBLE,
MRS. ROONEY.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.856
LET ME GET THE BROOM
AND HELP CLEAN UP.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.492
NO NO NO.
DO NOT HELP.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.627
I WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS
MYSELF.

11:35.629 --> 11:37.462
( sighs )

11:37.464 --> 11:38.797
WHAT'S THE WAY?

11:38.799 --> 11:41.199
THE PARKER WAY.

11:42.501 --> 11:44.202
HAS ANYBODY SEEN MADDIE?

11:44.204 --> 11:45.704
OUR GAME STARTS
IN TWO MINUTES.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.205
MADDIE'S NOT HERE?

11:47.207 --> 11:51.509
WAIT, IF MADDIE DOESN'T SHOW,
THAT MEANS I HAVE TO PLAY.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.311
THAT CAN'T HAPPEN, MAN.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.781
DURING THE GAME IS WHEN
I GET MY HOMEWORK DONE.

11:58.617 --> 12:01.419
MADDIE WAS ACTING
REALLY WEIRD TODAY.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.355
AND DID SHE GET TALLER?

12:04.357 --> 12:05.924
TALLER?
( laughs )

12:05.926 --> 12:08.460
LIKE HOW MUCH TALLER?
LIKE 2 1/2 INCHES TALLER?

12:08.462 --> 12:09.761
YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.830
SHE JUST SEEMED DIFFERENT.

12:11.832 --> 12:14.432
SHE GIGGLED.
MADDIE DOESN'T GIGGLE.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.834
SHE SNORTS.

12:15.836 --> 12:20.505
IT'S LIKE SHE HAD SOME KIND
OF INNER SPARKLE, MAN.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.806
( gasps )

12:21.808 --> 12:23.241
THE SHOES.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.677
UM, I THINK I KNOW
WHERE SHE MIGHT BE.

12:25.679 --> 12:28.446
SO I WILL JUST GO GET HER.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.814
YEAH.
( laughs )

12:29.816 --> 12:31.483
SEE IF YOU CAN GET THEM
TO HOLD CURTAIN.

12:32.985 --> 12:35.520
WOW, THAT GIRL REALLY
DOESN'T GET SPORTS.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.889
ALL RIGHT, STAINS.
YOU'RE IN.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.724
FINE.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.731
I DIDN'T THINK I WAS
GOING TO PLAY TODAY.

12:50.002 --> 12:51.536
MADDIE.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.572
<i>( thumping dance music</i>
<i>playing )</i>

12:54.574 --> 12:56.441
( gasps )

13:00.679 --> 13:02.881
HEY, LIV.
( laughs )

13:02.883 --> 13:05.850
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:05.852 --> 13:10.421
WELL, I'M HERE TO TAKE YOU
BACK TO THE GAME.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.857
BUT WHAT IS ALL OF THIS?

13:12.859 --> 13:15.360
OH, YOU WERE SO RIGHT.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.896
I LOVE THESE SHOES!
( imitates explosion )

13:17.898 --> 13:19.731
OH!
( laughs )

13:19.733 --> 13:22.567
WELL, OKAY, WE CAN
TALK ABOUT THAT LATER.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.435
JUST KICK THOSE OFF AND WE
WILL GET YOU BACK TO THE GAME.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.437
PFFT.  I'M NOT GOING BACK
TO THAT GAME.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.438
( gasps )

13:27.440 --> 13:29.774
WHO ARE YOU?

13:29.776 --> 13:33.511
I AM A SHOE-LOVING
SPARKLY GIRL.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.680
( mouths )

13:35.682 --> 13:37.415
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY
SUPERMODEL WITH ME?

13:37.417 --> 13:39.017
YEAH.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.986
OF COURSE I DO.

13:43.589 --> 13:46.524
( both murmuring,
humming tune )

13:46.526 --> 13:48.860
NO NO NO NO.

13:48.862 --> 13:51.629
THIS...
THIS IS WRONG.

13:53.699 --> 13:55.767
MADDIE WAS OUT OF CONTROL.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.802
WHEW, THIS WAS
A MUCH BIGGER JOB

13:57.804 --> 14:02.073
AND I WAS DEFINITELY
GOING TO NEED BACKUP.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.575
BUT FIRST...

14:03.577 --> 14:04.909
OKAY, ONE MINUTE.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.010
YES.

14:06.012 --> 14:09.447
( singing indistinctly )

14:16.856 --> 14:19.524
ARE YOU SURE WE CAN'T HELP
YOU WITH SOMETHING, MOM?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.426
OH, NO.
YOU BOYS JUST SIT HERE

14:21.428 --> 14:22.894
AND DO NOT LIFT A FINGER.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.529
YOU MIGHT BREAK
ONE OF THEM TOO.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.499
I AM GOING TO DO
SOME YARD WORK.

14:28.501 --> 14:29.934
YOU'RE THE BOSS.

14:29.936 --> 14:32.470
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.372
THE PARKER WAY.

14:38.143 --> 14:39.844
( both gasp )

14:42.414 --> 14:43.448
<i>( machine starts )</i>

14:43.450 --> 14:46.150
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

14:46.152 --> 14:50.455
UM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
MRS. ROONEY?

14:50.457 --> 14:52.657
OH, YOU KNOW,
JUST JAMMING THESE BIG BRANCHES

14:52.659 --> 14:54.592
INTO THIS HUNDRED-HORSEPOWER
MONSTER

14:54.594 --> 14:57.629
WITH 40 RAZOR-SHARP
STAINLESS STEEL TEETH.

14:57.631 --> 14:59.430
<i>( grinding, loud boom )</i>

15:01.967 --> 15:04.168
Both: WHOA!

15:04.170 --> 15:05.603
<i>( machine shuts off )</i>

15:05.605 --> 15:07.705
NO WAY.
CAN WE HELP?

15:07.707 --> 15:09.741
OH, SWEETIE,
IF I CAN'T TRUST YOU

15:09.743 --> 15:11.409
TO CARRY YOUR PLATE
TO THE SINK,

15:11.411 --> 15:13.845
THEN I SURE CAN'T TRUST YOU
AROUND THIS BAD BOY.

15:13.847 --> 15:16.514
SERIOUSLY?

15:16.516 --> 15:19.550
BUT THERE IS NOTHING
I'VE EVER WANTED TO DO MORE.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.520
YOU KNOW,
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

15:22.522 --> 15:25.990
AND I'M PUTTING THE TRAINING
WHEELS BACK ON YOUR BIKE.

15:25.992 --> 15:27.625
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS--

15:27.627 --> 15:31.562
BOUGHT YOU SOME CRAYONS
AND SAFETY SCISSORS.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.631
THEY'RE INSIDE.
YOU WANT UPPY?

15:35.567 --> 15:37.902
NICE WORK, PARKER.

15:37.904 --> 15:40.638
WE GOT OURSELVES
OUT OF THAT ONE.

15:42.441 --> 15:45.576
( gasps )
SWEET!

15:45.578 --> 15:47.111
IT'S THE 64 PACK.

15:47.113 --> 15:50.615
IT HAS A SHARPENER
BUILT INTO THE BOX.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.551
OH, WAIT.
YOUR MOM TOOK THAT OUT.

15:53.553 --> 15:54.919
<i>( grinding, loud boom )</i>

15:54.921 --> 15:56.721
Karen:  <i>YEAH, BABY!</i>

15:56.723 --> 15:58.589
MAN, THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.158
MORE FUN THAN ALL THIS?

16:00.160 --> 16:02.226
( gasps )

16:02.228 --> 16:04.228
BURNT SIENNA.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.830
-  <i>( grinding, loud boom )</i>
<i>- </i> <i>WHOO-HOO!</i>

16:05.832 --> 16:08.099
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S NOT LETTING US HELP.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.001
EXACTLY.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.569
THANKS TO YOU,

16:11.571 --> 16:14.172
SHE'LL NEVER LET US DO STUFF
LIKE THAT AGAIN.

16:15.674 --> 16:17.608
CAN A BROTHER
GET A FIST BUMP?

16:20.746 --> 16:23.781
SO IF I DON'T EVER
DO ANYTHING,

16:23.783 --> 16:25.583
I DON'T EVER
GET TO DO ANYTHING?

16:25.585 --> 16:28.586
IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING

16:28.588 --> 16:31.155
THAT WAS THE PRIMARY MESSAGE
OF THE PARKER WAY.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.825
WELL,
PERHAPS THE PARKER WAY

16:33.827 --> 16:35.226
IS MISGUIDED.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.662
WOULD FRESH-BAKED MUFFINS
MAKE THIS BETTER?

16:37.664 --> 16:39.697
CERTAINLY COULDN'T HURT.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.735
ALL RIGHT, JOEY.
YOU GOT THIS.

16:43.737 --> 16:45.837
INSIDE THIS SCRAWNY,
UN-ATHLETIC,

16:45.839 --> 16:47.638
MUSCLE-FREE SACK OF BONES

16:47.640 --> 16:49.741
IS A NATURAL-BORN
SHUTTLE RUNNER.

16:49.743 --> 16:52.276
THAT MEANS A LOT
COMING FROM YOU.

16:52.278 --> 16:53.945
BUT IT'S USELESS.

16:53.947 --> 16:56.914
THERE IS NO WAY I CAN
DO THIS IN 35 SECONDS.

16:56.916 --> 17:01.686
I CAN KISS VALEDICTORIAN
A GOOD-BYE.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.054
DUDE, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

17:03.056 --> 17:06.991
AND KNOW THAT THE DIG-MAN
STILL HAS A COUPLE TRICKS
UP HIS SLEEVE.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.527
ALSO, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TIE YOUR SHOE.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.795
AH, PFFT.  YEAH.
( chuckles )

17:10.797 --> 17:12.630
ALL RIGHT, JOEY.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.732
YOU GET ONE LAST SHOT
TO PASS YOUR SHUTTLE RUN.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.234
OKAY.

17:16.236 --> 17:19.037
BUT BEFORE WE DO THIS--
QUESTION.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.705
- GO!
- OKAY.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.274
-    <i>( screams )</i>
<i>- NO!</i>

17:24.543 --> 17:27.912
-    <i>( screams )</i>
<i>- GROSS!</i>

17:27.914 --> 17:29.580
RUN, JOEY, RUN!

17:29.582 --> 17:31.616
JOEY, YOU WANT TO GO
TO PROM?

17:31.618 --> 17:34.185
NO NO NO NO NO!

17:34.187 --> 17:35.987
<i>( beeps )</i>

17:35.989 --> 17:39.624
25.4.
THAT'S A NEW SCHOOL RECORD.

17:40.659 --> 17:42.693
MY SON'S A JOCK.

17:42.695 --> 17:46.064
MY SON'S A JOCK!

17:46.066 --> 17:49.000
YEAH.

17:50.302 --> 17:53.004
THANKS, DIGGIE.  COULDN'T HAVE
DONE IT WITHOUT YOU.

17:53.006 --> 17:56.040
CONGRATULATIONS,
LITTLE MAN.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.342
THANKS.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.078
I'M TOO TIRED TO RUN AWAY.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.681
I KNOW.

18:05.150 --> 18:09.120
OKAY, SO WE ARE ALL HERE
FOR MADDIE'S INTERVENTION.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.822
- ( crunching loudly )
-    <i>IT IS VERY IMPORTANT</i>
<i>THAT WE MAKE HER FEEL</i>

18:10.824 --> 18:13.057
LIKE SHE'S WALKING
INTO A ROOM THAT IS SAFE,

18:13.059 --> 18:16.227
AND LOVING, AND SUPPORTIVE
AND-- STAINS!

18:16.229 --> 18:18.629
I AM GOING TO SLAP THAT BAG
OUT OF YOUR HANDS.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.998
WHY DID YOU PUT THEM OUT

18:21.000 --> 18:23.167
IF YOU DON'T WANT
ANYONE TO EAT THEM?

18:27.739 --> 18:34.612
All: HEY...!

18:34.614 --> 18:36.814
( high-pitched )
HEY.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.816
HEY.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.686
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

18:41.688 --> 18:44.989
AND WHY ARE YOU
ALL STARING AT ME?

18:44.991 --> 18:47.959
AND WHY DID WILLOW
JUST LOCK THE FRONT DOOR?

18:47.961 --> 18:49.894
YEAH, WHY DID SHE?

18:49.896 --> 18:53.264
IT'S MAKING ME NERVOUS.

18:53.266 --> 18:56.100
MADDIE, WE ARE ALL HERE

18:56.102 --> 18:58.903
TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.671
( scoffs )
WHAT PRO--

19:00.673 --> 19:01.873
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.040
YEAH, YOU DO.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.042
YOU'RE OBSESSED
WITH THOSE SHOES.

19:05.044 --> 19:06.677
I AM NOT OBSESSED.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.179
THEY'RE JUST
MY NEW BEST FRIENDS

19:08.181 --> 19:10.248
AND THE ONLY THINGS
IN THE WORLD THAT MATTER.

19:10.250 --> 19:13.050
YOU USED TO TELL ME
HOW YOU HATED HIGH HEELS.

19:13.052 --> 19:15.653
HAVE OUR SUNDAY AFTERNOON
EMPOWERMENT WALKS
MEANT NOTHING?!

19:15.655 --> 19:18.089
OKAY.

19:18.091 --> 19:20.391
SO I USED TO NOT LIKE THEM
AND NOW I DO.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.993
I MEAN, A GIRL HAS THE RIGHT
TO CHANGE HER MIND

19:21.995 --> 19:23.895
AND ALSO TELL
HER FRIENDS AND FAMILY

19:23.897 --> 19:25.897
THAT THEY ARE ANNOYING
AND SHOULD STOP BOTHERING HER.

19:25.899 --> 19:28.266
I MEAN, LIV, YOU WERE
THE ONE WHO TOLD ME

19:28.268 --> 19:30.968
TO EMBRACE
MY INNER SPARKLE.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.437
I DID, BUT I WAS WRONG.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.705
I MEAN, MADDIE,
NOW YOUR PRIORITIES

19:34.707 --> 19:35.973
ARE ALL OUT OF WHACK.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.241
YOU MISSED A GAME.

19:37.243 --> 19:38.743
YEAH, MAN.
I HAD TO PLAY.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.412
I MADE A BASKET...
FOR THE OTHER TEAM.

19:43.382 --> 19:45.149
AND WHAT ABOUT
OUR FRO-YO DATE?

19:45.151 --> 19:48.686
MADS, IT WAS TWO-FOR-ONE
TOPPINGS NIGHT.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.722
AND I HATE THAT
YOU'RE TALLER THAN ME.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.725
THERE.
I SAID IT.

19:54.727 --> 19:57.295
AND I PASSED
THE SHUTTLE RUN.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.398
NOT RELEVANT
TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT,

20:00.400 --> 20:03.267
BUT I'M JUST SO PROUD
OF MYSELF.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.870
OKAY, GUYS,
IT'S JUST A PAIR OF--

20:05.872 --> 20:09.207
WAIT, HOLD ON.
YOU PASSED?

20:09.209 --> 20:11.309
YOU KNOW WHAT?  I CAN TAKE
THESE OFF WHENEVER I WANT TO.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.843
HA!

20:12.845 --> 20:15.313
OKAY, THEN DO IT.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.883
WELL, I SAID THAT
I CAN TAKE THEM OFF

20:18.885 --> 20:20.184
WHENEVER I WANT TO,

20:20.186 --> 20:22.954
AND I JUST DON'T WANT TO
RIGHT NOW.

20:22.956 --> 20:24.355
SO...
( clears throat )

20:24.357 --> 20:25.389
DEAL WITH IT.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.825
OH, WE WILL.
NOW!

20:27.827 --> 20:30.394
- ( stammering )
- DIGGIE, GRAB HER LEGS.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.829
OH!

20:31.831 --> 20:33.397
PUT ME DOWN!

20:33.399 --> 20:37.068
WHA--  MY SHOES!

20:37.070 --> 20:39.737
( grumbles )

20:39.739 --> 20:43.341
LIV, GIVE ME BACK
MY SHOES.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.009
OOH!
MUFFINS.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.345
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.479
- LIV, NO!
- ( machine starts )

20:48.481 --> 20:50.881
DON'T PUNISH THE PUMPS.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.283
OH, BELIEVE ME, MADDIE.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.451
THIS IS GOING TO HURT ME
A LOT MORE

20:53.453 --> 20:55.019
THAN IT'S GOING TO HURT YOU.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.188
OH-- ( scoffs )
WAIT, WHAT AM I SAYING?

20:57.190 --> 20:58.889
LIKE THERE'S ANY WAY
IN THE UNIVERSE

20:58.891 --> 21:01.392
THAT LIV ROONEY WOULD DESTROY
THE PERFECT PAIR OF--

21:01.394 --> 21:02.593
<i>( grinding, loud boom )</i>

21:02.595 --> 21:05.796
NO!

21:05.798 --> 21:07.164
<i>( shuts off machine )</i>

21:07.166 --> 21:12.003
- ( gasps )
- IT'S GOING TO START
TO GET BETTER.

21:12.005 --> 21:14.272
BUT THIS IS SO HARD.

21:14.274 --> 21:16.240
AND MY FEET ARE...

21:16.242 --> 21:17.475
SO COLD.

21:17.477 --> 21:20.945
I HAVE A COUPLE
OF OLD FRIENDS

21:20.947 --> 21:22.413
WHO WANT TO SAY HI.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.949
OH.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.484
THANK YOU.

21:26.486 --> 21:27.985
( chuckles )
WOW.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.254
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT CAME OVER ME.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.456
WELL, MADDIE, YOU TAPPED
INTO YOUR INNER SPARKLE.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.426
YEAH, MAN.
IT HAPPENS TO ALL OF US.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.431
LUCKILY, YOU HAVE
A SISTER TO GUIDE YOU

21:40.433 --> 21:42.133
THROUGH ALL THINGS SPARKLY.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.267
SO WE WILL START SLOW.

21:43.269 --> 21:45.303
OKAY, THIS IS
STRAWBERRY LIP GLOSS.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.837
DON'T EAT IT.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.139
( mouths )

21:51.543 --> 21:53.444
HERE YOU GO, MOM.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.946
FLORIDA ORANGES,
FRESHLY SQUEEZED,

21:55.948 --> 21:58.182
CHILLED GLASS.

21:58.184 --> 22:00.017
I'LL GO START
ON THE CROISSANTS.

22:00.019 --> 22:02.520
THANK YOU, SWEETIE.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.288
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU,

22:04.290 --> 22:06.357
BUT I LIKE IT.

22:06.359 --> 22:09.493
WELL, I'M ON MY WAY HOME,
MRS. ROONEY.

22:09.495 --> 22:12.096
EVAN...

22:12.098 --> 22:13.831
I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.599
OUR PLAN WORKED PERFECTLY.

22:15.601 --> 22:19.537
YOU DID A BRILLIANT JOB
OF HELPING ME REPROGRAM PARKER.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.405
MRS. ROONEY
HAD A PROBLEM.

22:21.407 --> 22:23.441
PARKER WAS USING
THE PARKER WAY

22:23.443 --> 22:25.176
TO GET OUT
OF ALL OF HIS CHORES.

22:25.178 --> 22:27.411
I TOLD HER THERE WAS
A DIFFERENT WAY.

22:27.413 --> 22:30.314
A BETTER WAY.
THE EVAN WAY.

22:30.316 --> 22:31.382
