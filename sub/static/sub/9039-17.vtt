WEBVTT

00:03.733 --> 00:06.167
- HEY, HOW MUCH LONGER WE GOT
TO HELP OUT WITH THIS THING?

00:06.200 --> 00:08.600
- RAY, ALL THE PARENTS
HAVE TO DO THEIR TIME.

00:08.633 --> 00:10.800
COME ON, YOU DON'T SEE
BILL PARKER COMPLAINING.

00:10.833 --> 00:14.167
- OH, BILL PARKER.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.500
MR. "LOOK AT ME,
I'M KING OF THE CARNIVAL."

00:16.533 --> 00:18.300
- OH, COME ON.

00:18.333 --> 00:19.800
HE'S DOING IT
FOR THE SCHOOL.

00:19.833 --> 00:21.400
HE'S A GOOD FATHER.

00:21.433 --> 00:22.900
- OH, WHAT, HE'S A BETTER
FATHER THAN ME?

00:22.933 --> 00:25.300
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
I'M NOT A GOOD FATHER?

00:25.333 --> 00:26.500
- YOU WANT TO BE
A GOOD FATHER?

00:26.533 --> 00:29.400
GO HELP OUT
IN THE CHILD CARE ROOM.

00:29.433 --> 00:32.367
- I'LL GO.
THEY GOT A TV IN THERE?

00:32.400 --> 00:35.967
- HEY, BARONE, WHAT HAPPENED?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.100
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:37.133 --> 00:38.533
- HEY, NO, PARKER,
I'M JUST DOING THIS.

00:38.567 --> 00:39.967
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
GIMME THAT.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.233
I CAN DO THAT,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:41.267 --> 00:42.533
- YOU GOT IT?
- YES.

00:42.567 --> 00:44.733
- WE'RE READY TO FINISH
THE REST OF THE BOOTH FRAMES.

00:44.767 --> 00:46.067
I COULD USE SOME MUSCLE.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.967
- LET'S ROCK.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.033
I'LL BE BACK
TO CHECK ON THOSE,

00:51.067 --> 00:52.800
AND THEY BETTER BE
SPOT-FREE, OKAY?

00:52.833 --> 00:57.667
THIS ISN'T LIKE HOME,
WHERE I LET THAT STUFF SLIDE.

00:57.700 --> 00:59.867
HEY! HEY!

00:59.900 --> 01:00.867
COME ON!

01:00.900 --> 01:02.367
MY ANKLES.
YOU WET MY ANKLES.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.400
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

01:03.433 --> 01:04.733
THAT'S TOXIC, THAT STUFF.

01:04.767 --> 01:09.367
THAT SINKS RIGHT THROUGH
THE SOCKS AND INTO THE SKIN.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.100
I LIKE TO BUST HER CHOPS.
KEEP HER IN LINE.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.033
- ALL RIGHT, BARONE,
SEE IF YOU CAN FASTEN IT.

01:19.067 --> 01:20.600
- ALL RIGHT.

01:20.633 --> 01:22.700
ALL RIGHT, PARKER,
IT'S JUST FASTENING RIGHT?

01:22.733 --> 01:25.367
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE DOING ROCKET--

01:25.400 --> 01:26.900
AH! OH!

01:26.933 --> 01:29.867
MOTHER OF UGLY!

01:29.900 --> 01:31.467
- AGAIN?

01:31.500 --> 01:32.267
YOU OKAY THERE?

01:32.300 --> 01:34.900
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

01:34.933 --> 01:36.700
MAMMY!

01:38.333 --> 01:41.133
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD DO
SOMETHING A LITTLE LESS...

01:41.167 --> 01:43.600
STRENUOUS.

01:43.633 --> 01:46.600
HOW ABOUT STENCILING
WITH THE LADIES?

01:46.633 --> 01:47.633
- NO.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.733
NO, I DON'T HAVE
TO DO STENCILING.

01:49.767 --> 01:50.967
I CAN DO THIS.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.333
THE ONLY REASON I CUT MYSELF
IS 'CAUSE I'M USED TO WORKING

01:53.367 --> 01:55.033
WITH THE BIG TOOLS.

01:55.067 --> 01:57.067
YEAH.

01:57.100 --> 01:58.067
- HI, DAD!
- HEY, DAD!

01:58.100 --> 01:59.333
- HEY, TYLER.
- HEY.

01:59.367 --> 02:01.433
- LOOK AT ALL
MY NEW HACKIDU CARDS.

02:01.467 --> 02:02.533
- HACKIDU.

02:02.567 --> 02:04.533
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW THEY LOVE THE HACKIDU.

02:04.567 --> 02:09.667
- I CAN BELIEVE ANYTHING
YOU CAN, PROBABLY MORE.

02:09.700 --> 02:11.133
- WE TRADED, DAD.

02:11.167 --> 02:12.767
- LET'S SEE WHAT YOU
HAVE THERE, SON.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.100
OOH.

02:14.133 --> 02:16.267
VEENA-POD,
RAIN-WHIFFLE, E-JAZZ.

02:16.300 --> 02:19.800
- HEY, LET'S SEE WHAT--YEAH--
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT THERE.

02:19.833 --> 02:21.100
"SCRA--UH, SCROM..."

02:21.133 --> 02:22.267
- SCRAMISAUR.

02:22.300 --> 02:24.100
- SCRAMISAUR.
LET ME SEE HIM.

02:24.133 --> 02:28.300
- DON'T GET BLOOD ON HIM.

02:28.333 --> 02:30.867
- WAIT A MINUTE, ALLY,
YOU GAVE AWAY ALL YOUR CARDS

02:30.900 --> 02:31.867
FOR JUST ONE CARD?

02:31.900 --> 02:33.000
- YEAH.

02:33.033 --> 02:35.767
- NOW, TYLER, THAT DOESN'T
SEEM QUITE FAIR, DOES IT?

02:35.800 --> 02:36.633
- IT'S OKAY.

02:36.667 --> 02:38.200
- NO, NO, ALLY,
MR. PARKER'S RIGHT.

02:38.233 --> 02:40.467
YOU GAVE AWAY
ALL YOUR CARDS THERE.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.100
- TYLER, LET ME HAVE
ALLY'S CARDS BACK.

02:42.133 --> 02:43.167
- DAD.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.367
- TYLER, I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT.

02:44.400 --> 02:47.833
COME ON, LET'S HAVE THOSE CARDS.

02:47.867 --> 02:51.000
- SORRY ABOUT THIS, BARONE.
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

02:51.033 --> 02:52.333
- DADDY...

02:52.367 --> 02:54.400
- ALLY, IT'S OKAY.
DADDY'S HANDLING THIS. GO AHEAD.

02:54.433 --> 02:56.000
THANKS.
THANKS THERE, PARKER.

02:56.033 --> 02:57.300
- HEY, YOU'RE WELCOME.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.267
I DON'T USUALLY INTERFERE
IN THESE THINGS,

02:59.300 --> 03:00.967
BUT SOMETIMES
THAT'S A DAD'S JOB.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.067
- YEAH.

03:02.100 --> 03:03.800
AND YOU TAUGHT HIM
A GOOD LESSON THERE TOO.

03:03.833 --> 03:04.800
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

03:04.833 --> 03:06.267
- WAIT, WHERE YOU GOING?

03:06.300 --> 03:08.100
- OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, I THOUGHT I WOULD

03:08.133 --> 03:10.400
GO STENCILING, LIKE YOU SAID.

03:10.433 --> 03:12.967
- WELL, STENCILING'S
RIGHT THERE.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.133
- OH. OH, THERE IT IS.
OKAY, THANK YOU.

03:19.067 --> 03:22.200
[drill buzzing]

03:29.333 --> 03:31.167
- YOU COULD MAKE THAT SHOT.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.700
- YOU WANT TO GO
ONE-ON-ONE RIGHT NOW?

03:36.233 --> 03:38.400
- RAY, WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU?

03:38.433 --> 03:41.367
- OH, I KNOW THIS.
I KNOW THIS ONE.

03:43.733 --> 03:47.233
- ALLY TOLD ME YOU
JUST UNDID HER HACKIDU TRADE

03:47.267 --> 03:48.633
WITH BILL PARKER'S BOY.

03:48.667 --> 03:52.500
- HE'S A LOUSY DAD.
GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.667
- SHUT UP.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.600
YEAH, SHE WAS GIVING AWAY
ALL HER CARDS FOR ONE CARD.

03:55.633 --> 03:58.033
I SAVED HER FROM
GETTING RIPPED OFF, THAT'S ALL.

03:58.067 --> 03:59.500
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
OH, COME ON.

03:59.533 --> 04:00.967
YOU SEE?
YOU'RE MAKING ME MISS IT.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.167
- WELL, SHE'S UPSET.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.033
THAT'S THE TRADE
SHE WANTED TO MAKE, ALL RIGHT?

04:04.067 --> 04:05.633
YOU GOT TO GO BACK OVER
TO BILL PARKER

04:05.667 --> 04:07.633
AND UNDO WHAT YOU UNDID.

04:07.667 --> 04:09.067
- WHAT ARE YOU GETTING
SO EXCITED FOR?

04:09.100 --> 04:12.300
IT'S JUST STUPID HACKIDU CARDS.
SHE'LL GET OVER IT, OKAY?

04:12.333 --> 04:14.433
- WRONG.

04:14.467 --> 04:17.133
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE WRONG.

04:17.167 --> 04:18.467
THEY'RE NOT JUST CARDS.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.000
I NEVER SEEN THESE,
WHATCHAMACALLEM,

04:21.033 --> 04:23.567
HACKENSACK CARDS?

04:23.600 --> 04:24.700
- HACKIDU.

04:24.733 --> 04:25.967
- OKAY, WHATEVER, WHATEVER.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.833
BUT I KNOW ONE THING:

04:27.867 --> 04:31.600
KIDS LOVE THIS CARD CRAP.

04:31.633 --> 04:34.267
WHEN YOU WERE A KID, YOU WERE
ALL LOOPY ABOUT BATMAN CARDS.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.900
YOU LOVED 'EM.

04:35.933 --> 04:37.500
AND OUR OLD PICNIC TABLE
WAS WOBBLY,

04:37.533 --> 04:38.900
AND I TOOK
A BUNCH OF THOSE CARDS

04:38.933 --> 04:41.033
AND STUCK 'EM UNDER THE LEG.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.267
- I REMEMBER THAT.

04:44.300 --> 04:46.233
THEY GOT DESTROYED
IN THE RAIN.

04:46.267 --> 04:50.433
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA CRY,
ARE YOU, RAYMOND?

04:50.467 --> 04:53.100
- NO. THAT'S THE THING.
HE DIDN'T CRY.

04:53.133 --> 04:55.767
HE JUST LOOKED...
BETRAYED.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.067
IT TORE MY HEART OUT.

04:57.100 --> 05:00.467
I CAN'T FORGET THAT LOOK.

05:00.500 --> 05:04.400
STOP IT.

05:04.433 --> 05:05.533
- WHAT?

05:05.567 --> 05:08.767
- THAT LOOK. THERE IT IS.
STOP IT.

05:08.800 --> 05:09.900
- I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

05:09.933 --> 05:10.900
- DON'T LIE.

05:10.933 --> 05:13.900
IT'S SUBTLE, BUT IT'S THERE.

05:13.933 --> 05:17.333
HEY, I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR CARDS ALREADY.

05:17.367 --> 05:21.867
IT'S THE ONE THING
I DID WRONG.

05:21.900 --> 05:25.933
- THE ONE THING?

05:25.967 --> 05:27.200
HOW ABOUT WHEN I WAS
10 YEARS OLD,

05:27.233 --> 05:29.567
AND YOU BACKED YOUR CAR
OVER MY BIG TOE?

05:33.300 --> 05:35.433
- DOESN'T RING A BELL.

05:38.100 --> 05:41.400
- FRANK...
I'M SICK OF THIS.

05:41.433 --> 05:44.833
GO CLEAN YOUR WHISKERS
OUT OF THE SINK.

05:44.867 --> 05:46.333
- AFTER YOU.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.233
- WAIT A SECOND, DAD.

05:53.267 --> 05:55.433
THE BATMAN THING
IS NOT THE SAME, OKAY?

05:55.467 --> 05:57.100
'CAUSE YOU RUINED
MY CARDS.

05:57.133 --> 05:58.567
I SAVED ALLY'S CARDS.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.367
SHE WANTED TO GET RID OF
ALL HER CARDS FOR ONE.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.467
- WHICH IS WHAT
SHE WANTED TO DO.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.833
- WILL YOU STOP, PLEASE, HUH?
IT'S OVER.

06:04.867 --> 06:06.333
- WHAT KIND OF CARDS?

06:06.367 --> 06:08.800
- NOTHING, MA, JUST THIS
KOREAN THING

06:08.833 --> 06:10.067
THE KIDS ARE INTO NOW.

06:10.100 --> 06:13.333
- OH, HACKIDU.

06:13.367 --> 06:14.733
WHAT CARD DID SHE HAVE?

06:14.767 --> 06:16.767
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
SCRAMMIE SOMETHING OR OTHER.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.100
- A SCRAMISAUR?

06:19.133 --> 06:20.700
- YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS STUFF?

06:20.733 --> 06:21.833
- A LITTLE.

06:21.867 --> 06:26.300
SCRAMISAUR'S THE FASTEST
CREATURE ON HACKIDU MOUNTAIN.

06:26.333 --> 06:29.100
HE STARTS OFF AS A SLUGAWOG,
VERY SLOW,

06:29.133 --> 06:30.900
AND HE CAN ONLY EVOLVE
INTO A SCRAMISAUR

06:30.933 --> 06:33.800
IF HE GETS
THE SONIC CRYSTAL.

06:33.833 --> 06:36.700
THAT'S WHY SCRAMISAURS
ARE RARE AND VALUABLE.

06:41.967 --> 06:44.233
I'M GRANDMA.

06:46.067 --> 06:48.467
I HAVE THIS AND CANDY.

06:50.967 --> 06:52.900
- WELL, WAIT A MINUTE, MOM.

06:52.933 --> 06:55.067
HOW VALUABLE IS
A SCRAMISAUR CARD?

06:55.100 --> 06:57.033
- OH, YOU CAN'T FIND 'EM
IN THE STORES.

06:57.067 --> 06:58.167
BELIEVE ME, I LOOKED.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.833
BUT IF YOU FIND ONE
MINT CONDITION, NO CREASES,

07:00.867 --> 07:02.667
THAT'S $65.

07:02.700 --> 07:05.200
- [gasps]
- $65?

07:05.233 --> 07:08.667
- HOLY CRAP.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.600
THIS IS THE WORK
OF THE NORTH KOREANS.

07:16.333 --> 07:19.367
- SO YOU HAD A SCRAMISAUR,
AND YOU LOST IT?

07:19.400 --> 07:20.667
- YEP. WHAT DO YOU KNOW, RAY?

07:20.700 --> 07:23.200
ALLY KNEW WHAT SHE
WAS DOING ALL ALONG.

07:23.233 --> 07:25.300
- OR PARKER DID.

07:25.333 --> 07:26.133
- WHAT?

07:26.167 --> 07:30.233
- YOU, SIR, ARE A NUMBSKULL.

07:30.267 --> 07:33.567
- NUMBSKULL-AWOG.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.567
- WAIT A MINUTE.
PARKER DIDN'T KNOW.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.200
HE WAS JUST TRYING TO SHOW ME
WHAT A GREAT DAD HE IS.

07:39.233 --> 07:42.500
- HE TOOK YOU FOR A RIDE,
SATCHMO.

07:42.533 --> 07:44.567
- COME ON.
- HEY, WAKE UP.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.267
YOU THINK THIS IS
JUST HACKIDU CARDS?

07:47.300 --> 07:48.700
YOU THINK IT'S ABOUT DADDY

07:48.733 --> 07:51.633
AND SETTING A NICE EXAMPLE
FOR A LITTLE BOY?

07:51.667 --> 07:54.000
THIS IS BUSINESS.

07:54.033 --> 07:56.567
THIS IS 65 BUCKS.

07:56.600 --> 08:01.100
PULL YOUR HEAD
OUT OF YOUR PANTS.

08:01.133 --> 08:04.133
- NO, FRANK,
BILL PARKER'S NOT LIKE THAT.

08:04.167 --> 08:06.100
WHERE YOU GOING?

08:06.133 --> 08:07.700
- I GOT A LITTLE
UNFINISHED BUSINESS

08:07.733 --> 08:09.100
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.267
- BOYFRIEND?

08:13.300 --> 08:17.433
- WELL, THIS COULD EXPLAIN
WHY ALL THE KIDS ARE BLOND.

08:25.100 --> 08:27.133
- AND SMART.

08:32.300 --> 08:33.600
- OH, HEY, PARKER.

08:33.633 --> 08:34.800
- OH, HEY, BARONE.

08:34.833 --> 08:35.733
- LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:35.767 --> 08:37.333
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
HOW WE MADE THE KIDS

08:37.367 --> 08:38.600
TRADE THE HACKIDU CARDS BACK,

08:38.633 --> 08:41.700
AND I KIND OF FELT BAD
FOR TAYLOR.

08:41.733 --> 08:45.033
- TYLER.
- TYLER.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.800
- NO, NO. HE'S FINE.
- YEAH?

08:46.833 --> 08:49.333
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

08:49.367 --> 08:50.567
I KNOW HOW KIDS ARE, YOU KNOW?

08:50.600 --> 08:52.667
THEY SEEM FINE, THEN LATER ON,
THEY GET ALL UPSET.

08:52.700 --> 08:57.067
SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S OKAY
IF YOUR BOY WANTS TO TRADE BACK.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.867
- OH, THANKS, YOU KNOW, THAT'S
REALLY NICE OF YOU, BARONE,

08:58.900 --> 09:02.300
BUT THAT WOULDN'T BE FAIR
TO ALLY, WOULD IT?

09:02.333 --> 09:04.167
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT, YEAH.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.200
YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE
THE FAIRER THING

09:06.233 --> 09:08.600
TO, LIKE, EVEN THE TRADE OUT?

09:08.633 --> 09:12.333
MAYBE ALLY COULD GIVE YOUR SON
JUST A COUPLE CARDS

09:12.367 --> 09:14.433
FOR THAT SCRABBY--
SOMETHING.

09:14.467 --> 09:16.567
WHATEVER THAT THING,
WHATEVER THEY CALL IT.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.967
- I DON'T KNOW.
THEY HAVE THE WEIRDEST NAMES.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.467
- YEAH, YEAH, THAT HACKIDU.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.567
I THINK THAT'S KOREAN
FOR "STUPID AMERICANS."

09:22.600 --> 09:24.400
[both laugh]

09:24.433 --> 09:27.200
YEAH, SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

09:27.233 --> 09:28.467
- OH, THANKS,

09:28.500 --> 09:31.667
BUT WE SHOULD PROBABLY LEAVE
WELL ENOUGH ALONE.

09:31.700 --> 09:34.100
DON'T YOU THINK?

09:34.133 --> 09:37.200
- OKAY, LISTEN, YOU KNOW...

09:37.233 --> 09:39.033
YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE TRUTH?

09:39.067 --> 09:43.533
MY MOTHER HAS THIS CONNECTION
WITH THE KID AND THAT CARD,

09:43.567 --> 09:46.267
AND MY MOTHER KIND
OF WANTS TO GIVE IT TO HER,

09:46.300 --> 09:51.000
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S...OLD.

09:51.033 --> 09:52.267
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:52.300 --> 09:53.733
WHY DON'T I JUST

09:53.767 --> 09:55.900
AND YOU CAN GET A COUPLE
MORE CARDS FOR YOUR SON,

09:55.933 --> 09:58.667
AND I CAN TELL ALLY THAT
MY MOTHER GAVE IT TO HER,

09:58.700 --> 10:02.133
AND WE MAKE
THE OLD LADY HAPPY?

10:02.167 --> 10:05.100

10:28.567 --> 10:30.900

10:34.867 --> 10:38.400
- TOUGH NOOGIES, BARONE.

10:38.433 --> 10:40.333
- IT ISN'T TOUGH NOOGIES.

10:44.033 --> 10:45.967
WAIT'LL I TELL MY WIFE THE GUY

10:46.000 --> 10:51.400
SHE THINKS
IS BETTER THAN ME IS NOT.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.067
THERE'S YOUR KING.
THERE'S YOUR KING.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.967
LONG LIVE THE KING,

11:18.467 --> 11:21.133

11:21.167 --> 11:24.267
WHERE THE FLAMES SHOOT FORTH
IN THE NIGHT

11:24.300 --> 11:28.000
FROM THE SOURCE

11:28.033 --> 11:31.000

11:52.567 --> 11:56.433

11:59.400 --> 12:00.833
- OKAY.

12:00.867 --> 12:02.267
THAT'S ENOUGH TV.

12:02.300 --> 12:03.733
WHO WANTS SOME SUGAR?

12:03.767 --> 12:05.000
- ME!

12:05.033 --> 12:07.433
- OKAY, THERE YOU GO.

12:08.633 --> 12:09.967

12:10.000 --> 12:12.667
DID YOU GET
MY SCRAMISAUR BACK?

12:12.700 --> 12:14.700
- WELL, HERE'S THE THING,

12:14.733 --> 12:17.667
IT TURNS OUT THAT MOMMY'S HERO
MR. PARKER IS A BIG STINKING--

12:17.700 --> 12:19.467

12:19.500 --> 12:22.167

12:22.200 --> 12:24.333
I TRIED.

12:24.367 --> 12:25.900
- YEAH, I EVEN WENT
TO A LOT OF STORES.

12:25.933 --> 12:27.067
THEY DON'T HAVE
HACKIDU CARDS.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.433
BUT I DID GET YOU THIS.

12:28.467 --> 12:30.500
HUH?
IT'S A TROLL ON A PENCIL.

12:30.533 --> 12:31.500
HEY, HEY.

12:31.533 --> 12:34.200
WHOA. HA-HA.

12:36.567 --> 12:39.033
SOMEBODY NEEDS
THEIR HAIR COMBED.

12:39.067 --> 12:41.033
- THANK YOU.

12:43.967 --> 12:46.600
- EH, YOU GOT TO HAND IT
TO LITTLE ALLY.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.867
SHE DIDN'T CRY.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.800
SHE JUST LOOKED...

12:50.833 --> 12:54.600
BETRAYED.

12:54.633 --> 12:57.000
- WELL, WHY'D YOU GET 'EM HOOKED
ON THE CARDS ANYWAY?

12:57.033 --> 12:58.300
- ME?

12:58.333 --> 13:00.067
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT HAD 'EM
WATCH THE TV SHOW.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.200
THAT LEADS TO THE CARDS.

13:01.233 --> 13:02.567
- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS
THE TV SHOW.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.433
I WAS JUST TURNING THE TV ON
TO KEEP 'EM QUIET.

13:04.467 --> 13:06.433
- WHY DON'T YOU TRY TO READ 'EM
A BOOK ONCE IN A WHILE?

13:06.467 --> 13:08.300
- READING, THAT'S YOUR
ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING.

13:08.333 --> 13:09.567
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW
HOW TO READ, RAY?

13:09.600 --> 13:10.933
OH, I READ, I DANCE,

BROTHER RUSSELL.

13:16.633 --> 13:19.567
HE OWNS A COMIC BOOK SHOP.
HE'S GOT CARDS THERE.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.800
- RUSSELL'S
VINTAGE COMICS?

13:21.833 --> 13:23.033
- YEAH. HE'S A GOOD GUY.

13:23.067 --> 13:24.900
IF ANYONE HAS SCRAMISAUR,
HE DOES.

13:24.933 --> 13:26.100
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

13:26.133 --> 13:27.800
THIS IS IN HOHOKUS,
NEW JERSEY, ALL RIGHT?

13:27.833 --> 13:30.400
I'M NOT GOING ALL THE WAY OUT

13:31.467 --> 13:32.733
IT'S AN HOUR AND A HALF.

13:32.767 --> 13:36.633
SOME OF THAT'S STILL
INDIAN TERRITORY.

13:36.667 --> 13:37.600
- RAY--

13:37.633 --> 13:39.400

13:41.200 --> 13:43.533
I'M PUTTING AN END

KNOCK IT OFF.

13:49.267 --> 13:51.167
UPPER THIGH HOLE.

13:55.833 --> 13:57.500

13:57.533 --> 13:58.567
OH, THOSE CARDS.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.000

14:00.033 --> 14:02.167
LISTEN, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.267
COME OVER HERE.

14:04.300 --> 14:08.033
LOOK, I KNOW YOU WANT
THAT SCRAMISAUR.

14:08.067 --> 14:11.500
BUT THERE ARE SOME
PEOPLE OUT THERE,

14:11.533 --> 14:13.300
AND ALL THEY WANT WANT TO
DO IS GET RICH,

14:13.333 --> 14:16.267
SO THEY MAKE KIDS THINK
THAT THINGS ARE MORE VALUABLE

14:16.300 --> 14:17.867
THAN THEY REALLY ARE,

14:17.900 --> 14:19.667
THINGS LIKE--LIKE...

14:19.700 --> 14:22.767
PIECES OF PAPER
WITH PICTURES ON 'EM.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.033
- YOU MEAN LIKE MONEY?

14:27.067 --> 14:28.700
- NO, NO, NO.

14:28.733 --> 14:31.300
NO, MONEY IS IMPORTANT PIECES
OF PAPER WITH PICTURES ON 'EM.

14:31.333 --> 14:35.100
LOOK, WHAT DADDY DOESN'T LIKE
ABOUT THE HACKIDU PEOPLE

14:35.133 --> 14:36.333
IS THAT THEY'VE
MADE YOU BELIEVE

14:36.367 --> 14:40.400
THAT THIS SCRAMISAUR THING
IS WORTH $65.

14:40.433 --> 14:41.633
- $65?

14:41.667 --> 14:44.333
- YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S WHY
YOU WANTED IT, RIGHT?

14:44.367 --> 14:45.467
- NO.

14:45.500 --> 14:48.233
- WELL, WHY'D YOU TRADE
ALL YOUR CARDS FOR IT?

14:48.267 --> 14:50.467
- 'CAUSE SCRAMISAUR'S
MY FAVORITE.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.133
I LOVE HIM.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.367
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU LOVE HIM?

15:03.400 --> 15:05.767
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
YOU WANTED IT?

15:05.800 --> 15:07.467
- YEAH.

15:15.300 --> 15:18.133
IT'S OKAY, DADDY.

15:32.833 --> 15:34.467
- COME ON.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.767
YOU SHOULD BE
A BAD BOY, RIGHT?

15:55.767 --> 15:56.600
- WHAT?

15:56.633 --> 15:59.933
- ARE YOU WITH THE I.R.S.?
- NO.

15:59.967 --> 16:02.500
- YOU LOOK LIKE I.R.S.

16:02.533 --> 16:04.533
- I DO?

16:04.567 --> 16:09.500
- NO. THAT'S JUST IT.
YOU DON'T.

16:09.533 --> 16:14.100
- I'M A FRIEND
OF YOUR SISTER AMY.

16:14.133 --> 16:15.967
- OH, YEAH?
I'M RUSSELL.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.400
- RAY BARONE,
ROBERT'S BROTHER.

16:17.433 --> 16:19.467
- OH, ROBERT'S BROTHER.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.500
GET OUT.

16:21.533 --> 16:25.733
THANKS, CLARENCE.
SEE YOU AT THE CONVENTION.

16:25.767 --> 16:26.667
- LISTEN, I JUST--

16:26.700 --> 16:28.267
- LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.

16:28.300 --> 16:29.300
MY LITTLE SISTER PUT

16:29.333 --> 16:31.767
TWO CHILDBEARING YEARS
INTO GIGANTOR.

16:31.800 --> 16:37.400
THEN HE DUMPS HER WITHOUT
SO MUCH AS A SMACK-ME-BUM.

16:37.433 --> 16:40.233
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN, BUT...

16:40.267 --> 16:43.033
I THINK AMY WAS THE ONE
WHO BROKE UP WITH ROBERT

16:43.067 --> 16:48.733
WITHOUT THE...
SMACK-YOUR-BUM.

16:48.767 --> 16:49.567
- CAN YOU BLAME HER?

16:49.600 --> 16:51.067
I MEAN, THE GUY'S
GOT NO BACKBONE.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.200
HE CAN'T COMMIT
TO ANYTHING.

16:52.233 --> 16:53.467
WHAT KIND OF PERSON'S THAT?

16:53.500 --> 16:55.133
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
ROBERT AND I,

16:55.167 --> 16:56.433
WE'RE REALLY NOT THAT CLOSE.

16:56.467 --> 16:57.567
BUT LISTEN,

16:57.600 --> 17:00.633
I SAW YOU HAD A SIGN
SAYING YOU GOT HACKIDU CARDS.

17:00.667 --> 17:03.567
- WE'RE CLOSED.
GOOD DAY, SIR.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.733
- LISTEN.
LISTEN TO ME, PLEASE.

17:05.767 --> 17:08.267
I JUST DROVE TWO HOURS
IN THE RAIN AND THE TRAFFIC,

17:08.300 --> 17:10.233
AND MY BACK IS ALL SORE,

17:10.267 --> 17:12.067
AND THE ONLY THING
I HAD TO EAT

17:12.100 --> 17:14.700
WAS CHEERIOS ON THE SEAT
OF THE CAR.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.367
- YOUR BROTHER WAS
VERY LUCKY TO HAVE AMY.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.867
SHE'S VERY SUPPORTIVE.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.067
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

17:21.100 --> 17:23.400
- SHE'S THE ONE WHO SAID,
"OPEN YOUR COMIC BOOK STORE,"

17:23.433 --> 17:25.033
WHEN THE REST OF
THE FAMILY WAS SAYING,

17:25.067 --> 17:27.333
"UP YOUR MEDICATION."

17:30.233 --> 17:34.433
- LOOK, I LOVE AMY,
BELIEVE ME.

17:34.467 --> 17:35.600
- YOUR BROTHER NEEDS HELP.

17:35.633 --> 17:37.533
IF HE COULD JUST LEARN
TO LOVE HIMSELF.

17:37.567 --> 17:41.433
HE NEEDS TO LEARN
TO LOVE HIMSELF.

17:41.467 --> 17:44.233
- [sighs]

17:44.267 --> 17:45.433
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:45.467 --> 17:50.967
I MEAN, THAT'S THE GREATEST LOVE
OF ALL, RIGHT?

17:51.000 --> 17:54.633
- AMY SHOULD BE WITH YOU.

17:54.667 --> 17:58.667
- HEY, DON'T THINK I HAVEN'T
THOUGHT OF THAT, YOU KNOW?

18:01.600 --> 18:03.633
LISTEN...

18:03.667 --> 18:06.967
OKAY, I NEED A CERTAIN TYPE
OF HACKIDU CARD.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
- NO, YOU DON'T.

18:08.033 --> 18:09.467
- YES, I DO.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.167
MY DAUGHTER NEEDS A SCRAMISAUR.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.967
- LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT HACKIDU.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.433
IT'S EVIL.

18:18.467 --> 18:20.733
- OH, GOD.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.667
- IT'S GOT NO SUBSTANCE,
NO TRUTH.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.800
IT'S LIKE JUNK FOOD
FOR THE MIND.

18:24.833 --> 18:26.433
IT'S KIDDIE CRACK.

18:26.467 --> 18:28.367
- YEAH, OKAY, IT'S KIDDIE CRACK.

18:28.400 --> 18:32.467
WELL, I NEED $65 WORTH OF IT.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.000
- HOW OLD IS
YOUR DAUGHTER?

18:34.033 --> 18:36.333
- SEVEN.
- SEVEN.

18:36.367 --> 18:40.533
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT SHE NEEDS.

18:40.567 --> 18:43.633
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH
LITTLE LOTTA?

18:43.667 --> 18:45.667
YOU SEE, LOTTA'S A LITTLE GIRL
WITH A BOW ON HER HEAD,

18:45.700 --> 18:47.300
AND ALTHOUGH
SHE'S MORBIDLY OBESE,

18:47.333 --> 18:50.267
SHE STILL FINDS HAPPINESS.

19:00.833 --> 19:02.400
- DO YOU HAVE A PARTNER?

19:02.433 --> 19:05.733
'CAUSE MAYBE...I COULD
TALK TO HIM ABOUT THIS.

19:05.767 --> 19:07.067
- DON'T YOU GET IT,

19:07.100 --> 19:09.800
YOU LONG ISLAND
SUBURBAN AUTOMATON?

19:09.833 --> 19:13.200
YOU CAN'T HEAR THE TRUTH
OVER YOUR LAWNMOWER, MAN.

19:13.233 --> 19:14.367
- NO, WAIT.

19:14.400 --> 19:18.633
LISTEN, RUSSELL...
DO YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER?

19:18.667 --> 19:21.467
- I HAVE A SNAKE.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.233
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

19:24.267 --> 19:26.533
I AGREE WITH YOU, RUSSELL.

19:26.567 --> 19:29.567
LOOK, I HATE THIS HACKIDU THING,
AND I HATED THE LAST THING,

19:29.600 --> 19:30.467
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:30.500 --> 19:31.933
I'M GONNA HATE
THE NEXT THING TOO,

19:31.967 --> 19:34.333
