-Yeah, you treat yourself?
- Oh, man, let me tell you ..

03:24.080 --> 03:28.600
- Do you know that one Tuesday?
- Wait .. wait. You went on Tuesday?

03:28.720 --> 03:32.600
- No, no, the striper's name; Tuesday
-Oh yeah, I know her

03:32.680 --> 03:36.720
Anyway she's on stage dancing of
onspring summer song; "Come and play"

03:36.721 --> 03:37.721
-Nice touch.
-Very hot.

03:38.722 --> 03:39.922
- Keep going.
- I'm tipping her big.

03:39.923 --> 03:43.552
No ones, five spots. I'm laying 'em
on the rail- Boom, boom, boom.

03:45.200 --> 03:49.080
- She didn't like it?
- By the end of the song, I had $40 laid out.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.800
It's not a long song, is it?

03:52.560 --> 03:56.720
It is advantages to begin an autopsy
was removal the cranium

03:56.800 --> 04:02.200
The cranium is opened with a horizontal
division an inch above the eyebrow ridges.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.360
Something wrong?

04:22.920 --> 04:25.720
Who he love, saw, heard...

04:25.800 --> 04:27.880
remembered...

04:28.400 --> 04:30.480
What he feared...

04:31.560 --> 04:34.040
Somehow.. it's...

04:34.120 --> 04:37.280
...all locked in this small mass
of tissue and fluid.

04:39.640 --> 04:43.880
Are you OK, Agent Scully?
You kind of sounded a little spooky.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.720
Good afternoon, Agent Mulder.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.240
Four dollars for the first hour parking is criminal

06:04.000 --> 06:07.200
Which is you got better
at least 45 minutes

06:10.400 --> 06:13.280
You know Mulder, from...

06:13.360 --> 06:16.360
- from back there you look like him.
- Him?

06:17.800 --> 06:20.600
- Deep Throat.
- He's dead, Scully.

06:20.680 --> 06:26.280
I attended his funeral in Angleton
through eight power binocular from a distance of 1,000 yards away

06:26.360 --> 06:31.280
Now the picture frame was turned down.
You wanted to talk. What have you found?

06:31.360 --> 06:34.560
I wanted to talk,
but I haven't found anything.

06:34.640 --> 06:40.160
Is dangerous for us to stand a little chat, Scully.
We must assume, we're being watched.

06:40.240 --> 06:43.640
- I haven't seen any indication...
- No, of course not.

06:43.720 --> 06:48.440
- These people are the best.
- I have taken all the necessary precautions...

06:48.520 --> 06:53.960
I have double back over my track to make sure that they have'nt been followed.
No one has ever followed me.

06:54.560 --> 06:58.960
The <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font>  have been terminated, Mulder.
We have been re-assigned.

07:00.320 --> 07:04.800
- What makes do you think you they care about us anymore, anyway?
- So why you have bother to come here covertly?

07:04.880 --> 07:09.440
Because I realized that this is the only way
that you would see me.

07:09.520 --> 07:13.680
- So, what do you want?
- To know that you alright.

07:15.120 --> 07:19.920
Mulder, you pass me the day within a foot ... but you were miles away.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.880
I'm on electronic surveillance.

07:24.960 --> 07:29.080
White-bread cases, bank fraud,
insurance fraud, healthcare swindles.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.680
Mulder, I know that you feel...

07:32.960 --> 07:37.200
..frustrated.
That without the bureau resources, it is impossible for you to continue...

07:37.280 --> 07:39.360
- No.. it...
- For what then?

07:40.640 --> 07:45.560
When the bureau first shut us down,
you said that you'll go on for as long as the truth is out there.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.440
But I no longer feel that from you.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.920
Have you have'nt been to San Diego?

07:56.760 --> 07:58.840
Yeah.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.760
Did you check the Palomar Observatory?

08:02.840 --> 08:04.280
No

08:04.360 --> 08:08.320
From 1948 until recently,
it was the largest telescope in the world.

08:08.400 --> 08:13.560
The idea indesign came from brilliant wealthy astronomer
named George Ellery Hale.

08:13.680 --> 08:17.360
Actually, the idea was presented to Hale while he was playing billiards.

08:17.440 --> 08:23.640
An elf climb to his window and told him
to get the money from the Rockefeller Foundation for telescope.

08:24.440 --> 08:28.560
And you worried that the all your life is seeing the elf?

08:33.039 --> 08:35.440
In my case...

08:35.520 --> 08:37.240
little green man.

08:38.080 --> 08:43.120
But Mulder during the time in the
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font>  you've seen so much.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.200
That's just the point. Seeing is not enough.

08:46.280 --> 08:50.440
I should have something to hold on to.
Some solid evidence.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.280
I learned that from you.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.400
Your sister abduction,
you held into that.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.120
I'm beginning to wonder if...

09:08.480 --> 09:10.560
...if that ever even happened.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.680
Mulder...

09:14.760 --> 09:19.880
...even if George Hale only saw the elf in his mind,
The telescope still got built.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.640
Don't give up.

09:29.920 --> 09:32.000
And the next time...

09:32.920 --> 09:35.000
..we need out in open.

09:49.923 --> 09:54.469

between President Nixon and HR Haldeman...

09:54.553 --> 09:56.555
...while transcribing the tape.

09:57.222 --> 10:01.351
Woods testified that
she erased only about five minutes...

10:01.435 --> 10:05.606
...but the tape contained an 18-minute gap.
Under investigation...

10:05.680 --> 10:07.040
Scout.

10:07.107 --> 10:11.403
...HR Haldeman reiterated
the White House explanation that Woods...

10:11.480 --> 10:16.200
- Do we have to watch this, Fox?
- Leave it, I'm watching The Magician at nine.

10:16.280 --> 10:19.440
Mom and dad said I
can watch some movie, buttmunch.

10:19.520 --> 10:23.680

they said I'm in charge.

10:25.560 --> 10:28.520

10:29.640 --> 10:31.720
Aaah!!

10:33.200 --> 10:35.360

12:50.800 --> 12:53.600
Do you know the significance of this piece?

12:54.600 --> 12:58.680
Well, recalling music appreciation
with Professor Ganz...

12:58.760 --> 13:01.000
...Bach had a genius for polyphonic...

13:01.080 --> 13:05.280
This is the first selection of music
on the Voyager spacecraft.

13:06.840 --> 13:09.520
The first.

13:09.640 --> 13:12.880
Four and a half billion years from now...

13:12.960 --> 13:17.320
...when the sun exhausts its fuel
and swells to engulf the Earth...

13:18.760 --> 13:21.800
...this expression will still be out there...

13:22.520 --> 13:27.080
Travelling for four and a half billion years.

13:29.480 --> 13:33.120
That is, if it's not intercepted first.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.600
Imagine, Fox...

13:35.680 --> 13:39.280
...if another civilisation out there
were to hear this.

13:40.400 --> 13:44.160
They will think,
what a wonderful place the earth is must be.

14:07.800 --> 14:11.000
You've supported me
at great risk to your reputation.

14:11.120 --> 14:14.920
I realise that when they shut us down,
there was nothing you could do.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.480
All I can say is, I think we were close.

14:19.680 --> 14:22.200
To what? I don't know.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.400
What?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.680

14:37.280 --> 14:40.440
- I live for Bach.
- Then let's hear it again.

14:53.880 --> 14:58.640
I take it you are familiar with the

14:58.720 --> 15:03.120
The search for extraterrestial radio signal,
they shut it down.

15:03.200 --> 15:08.120
You have to go to radio telescope
at Arecibo, Puerto Rico

15:08.200 --> 15:14.080
I will try to delay them as long as I can.
But my guess is,  you'll have at least 24 hours.

15:14.160 --> 15:18.680
After that, I can no longer hold off

15:21.120 --> 15:24.720

- Yesterday

15:51.120 --> 15:53.400
- Where?
- In the bull pen hallway.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.640
Did you speak with him?

15:56.720 --> 15:59.120
No, is he in some kind of trouble?

15:59.200 --> 16:04.520
Agent Mulder failed to appear at his assignment
this morning. His whereabouts are unknown.

16:08.160 --> 16:12.000
- Sir, I volunteer my time to assist any search
- No Agent Scully, the bureau can handle.

16:14.080 --> 16:17.760
- She doesn't know where he is?
- How can you be so sure?

16:17.840 --> 16:21.600
Because if she knew,
she wouldn't so worried about him.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.440
I don't smoke.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.880
She find him.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.080
I see no sign, of any recent occupation.

18:51.360 --> 18:55.720
There's quite an odour of mildew
in the air. The air is stale.

18:55.800 --> 18:59.760
If anyone been here in recently,
I see no indication.

19:14.720 --> 19:20.440

lunch today, and then you don't show.

- May I ask, what are you doing here, Agent Scully?
- Are you following me?

21:02.400 --> 21:07.320
Agent Mulder residence is under surveillance.
Please explain why are you here?

21:08.200 --> 21:12.080
I was told by Assistant
Director, Mulder was gone.

21:12.160 --> 21:16.080
- So?
- So, whenever his away, I feed his fish.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.040
What the hell is this?

21:29.040 --> 21:32.400
Looks like a self-test the computer does.

21:41.720 --> 21:43.960
- Damn.
- Just dump it in the tank.

21:46.360 --> 21:49.320
That would be bad for the fish.

24:12.360 --> 24:15.280
<i>Did you say men?
Hombres?</i>

24:39.520 --> 24:41.600
It looks like the "Wow!" signal.

24:42.680 --> 24:46.640
- The "Wow!" signal?
- Ohio State has a radio telescope...

24:46.720 --> 24:50.600
...that conducts searches
for extraterrestrial intelligence.

24:51.320 --> 24:54.640
In August 1977, my buddy Jerry Ehman...

24:54.720 --> 24:58.120
...found a transmission
on a printout like this.

24:58.200 --> 25:01.040
He was so excited,
he wrote "Wow!" in the margins.

25:01.120 --> 25:03.000
What was there?

25:03.080 --> 25:07.120
Signal. 30 times stronger than
galactic background noise.

25:07.680 --> 25:13.080
Came through on 21 cm frequency,
which no satellite transmitter allowed to use.

25:13.200 --> 25:16.760
The signal was intermittent,
like Morse code.

25:17.280 --> 25:22.560
And more importantly, the signal seemed to
turn itself on while in the telescope's beam.

25:22.640 --> 25:28.120
The "Wow!" signal is the best evidence
of extraterrestrial intelligence. But this...

25:28.760 --> 25:30.880
This is better.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.200
Where did you get this?

25:33.280 --> 25:37.200
Maybe you can tell me.
Is that from Ohio state?

25:41.240 --> 25:42.920
Can't tell.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.680
There are a few nickel-and-dime
SETI projects around.

25:47.840 --> 25:53.800
UC Berkeley has one. The Planetary Society
has one at Harvard and in Argentina.
in Harvard and Argentina

25:53.880 --> 25:58.920
NASA was working out of Goldstone
in California and Arecibo in Puerto Rico.

26:29.200 --> 26:31.080
Mulder.

26:45.560 --> 26:50.600
This signal from 06.30 Tuesday: the narrow
band and matching of the antenna pattern...

26:50.680 --> 26:54.800
...indicates that it originated
from beyond lunar distance.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.280
The same message is transmitted

26:57.360 --> 27:02.040
No. Jorge, don't touch the red button.
<i>Noho on the rojo.</i>

27:03.400 --> 27:05.520
Thanks.

27:09.480 --> 27:14.040
The same message was transmitted
four hours later, on a wide-band

27:15.600 --> 27:20.760
...which puts its point of origin very close,
just miles away from...

27:22.000 --> 27:27.160
I send greetings on behalf of the people of our planet...
We step out from our solar system..
.... We have emerged from our global

27:27.240 --> 27:31.040
<i>-¡Son ellos! ¡Ya regresaron!
(Is they! It returned!)
-Its just a tape-machine,  Jorge.</i>

27:31.120 --> 27:33.680
<i>¡Vámonos inmediatamente, por favor!
(Lets go immiadietly, please!)</i>

27:33.760 --> 27:36.480
Where are we gonna go?
There's a storm outside.

27:39.600 --> 27:42.040
You can't be afraid, Jorge.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.520
Don't be afraid.

27:50.840 --> 27:52.920
You can't be afraid.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.360
Jorge!

28:07.440 --> 28:09.520
Jorge!

28:12.040 --> 28:14.120
Jorge!

28:16.440 --> 28:18.520
Jorge!

28:38.520 --> 28:43.640
Passengers holding tickets,
Please proceed immiadietly to Gate No 16

28:43.724 --> 28:47.311
<i>Atención, por favor. Último aviso.</i>

28:47.394 --> 28:53.442
<i>Pasajeros con boletos
para este vuelo, a la puerta 16.</i>

28:59.200 --> 29:03.200
Attention please,
This is the gate change announcement

29:03.280 --> 29:09.120
Flight 236 flight from Boston and
will now be arrive to the gate No. 7

29:46.280 --> 29:48.920
This is Fox Mulder, leave a message please.

29:51.280 --> 29:53.800
CA 519

29:54.640 --> 29:56.720
7.05

29:56.800 --> 29:58.280

30:19.920 --> 30:26.160
At the tone, Eastern Daylight Time
will be 5.47 and 40 seconds.

30:28.160 --> 30:34.400
Attention all passengers flight 235
to Atlanta, is now boarding to Gate No. 2

30:50.280 --> 30:54.560
Relax. We know where she going.
ST Kroetks, Caribbean airflight 519

30:54.640 --> 30:59.120
Take off at 7:05
gate in the other terminal

31:18.040 --> 31:20.960
I want a ticket on a 6:30 flight to San Juan

31:28.640 --> 31:30.720
Today is...

31:32.640 --> 31:34.720
time 10:30

31:35.760 --> 31:39.400
Although I am not a qualify in the pathologist,
I will record my observations of the body...

31:39.480 --> 31:44.920
...in case at some future time decomposition
should obscure forensic evidence.

31:46.680 --> 31:50.160
The subject, perhaps victim,
is Hispanic male...

31:51.040 --> 31:53.120
...undetermined age.

31:53.200 --> 31:56.320
There are no overt
external injuries apparent.

31:59.080 --> 32:02.440
There are no indications
of any lightning strikes.

32:03.200 --> 32:06.320
No sizzling of the hair
or burn of any kind

32:10.040 --> 32:11.760
There were no...

32:11.840 --> 32:15.600
There are no puncture wounds
due to needles or probes...

32:15.680 --> 32:19.280
...commonly associated with the case
alien abduction

32:20.760 --> 32:23.680
The subject was discovered
in a sitting position...

32:23.777 --> 32:28.615
...rigor mortis having set in-although
less than half an hour had elapsed.

32:29.960 --> 32:33.080
The skin is strikingly affected
by goose flesh.

32:34.280 --> 32:37.440
The body shows signs
of intense cadaveric spasm.

32:40.240 --> 32:42.600
The expression reflects...

32:45.720 --> 32:49.600
Oh my God, Scully.
It is as if he was frightened to death.

33:06.520 --> 33:09.040
Again Scully, there is nothing but evidence

33:10.480 --> 33:12.880
And again no evidence at all.

33:17.080 --> 33:21.760
The printouts of received transmission
indicate contact with another life form...

33:21.840 --> 33:24.000
Which is, I can not see it

33:25.280 --> 33:29.200
And even if I could see them,
would they really be there?

33:29.320 --> 33:34.800
How do i know, this could be a classified military satellite -
these transmissions are from the Voyager for a god sake.

33:34.880 --> 33:38.640
Could extraterrestrials
really have intercepted them?

33:39.480 --> 33:44.080
Or is this just some elaborate joke
played on those who want to believe?

33:46.040 --> 33:48.840
I send here by one of those people.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.080
Deep Throat says ''Trust no one".

33:52.040 --> 33:54.520
That's hard, Scully.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.120
Suspecting everyone.. everything...

33:58.880 --> 34:03.640
It wears you down. You even begin
to doubt what you know is the truth.

34:10.120 --> 34:12.040
Before....

34:12.120 --> 34:14.639
...I could only trust myself.

34:16.800 --> 34:19.159
Now, I can only trust you.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.080
And they've taken you away from me.

34:26.960 --> 34:31.000
My life up to this point
has been about the need to see her again.

34:31.920 --> 34:34.000
To see them.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.120
But what would I do if they really came?

35:33.720 --> 35:38.040
Deep Throat said "Trust no one."

35:39.400 --> 35:44.920
Trust.. No.. One...
- 'I send here by one of those people.'

35:45.040 --> 35:49.840
- Trust.. No.. One...
- 'Deep Throat says ''Trust no one".'

35:52.480 --> 35:54.640
No

37:21.280 --> 37:23.080
Mulder

37:23.160 --> 37:25.960
I was sure you were dead.

37:26.040 --> 37:28.840
Mulder, its Scully.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.360
Dana Scully. Did you know, where you are?

37:34.320 --> 37:36.440
They came, Scully.

37:37.120 --> 37:39.640
The ones that took her, they were here.

37:39.720 --> 37:42.160
Here? Or here?

37:42.280 --> 37:45.240
On the tape. The tape.

37:45.320 --> 37:47.400
Evidence.. proof...

37:49.600 --> 37:53.080
- The transmissions. It's all here.
- Proof of what?

37:53.160 --> 37:55.520
Contact.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.120
These print out. It is here.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.280
And the man.

38:03.120 --> 38:06.680
We'll have to examine the body.
There'll be more proof.

38:10.840 --> 38:14.560
- Is that them?
- No, this isn't it.

38:23.080 --> 38:26.960
It's the Blue Beret Crash Retrieval Team.
They'll kill us. Help me with the body.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.880
- We don't have time.
- Help me!

38:28.960 --> 38:32.760
Mulder, We're never gonna be able
to get the body out of the country!

38:37.560 --> 38:40.000
Mulde, we have to go.

38:40.680 --> 38:43.200
Evidence is worthless if you're dead.

39:07.520 --> 39:09.000
Let's go!

39:18.560 --> 39:21.680
Hold your fire!
Get the truck to the bottom of the hill.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.440
Move! Come on, move!

39:44.520 --> 39:46.160
Mulder!

40:06.040 --> 40:07.920
Damn it!

40:15.080 --> 40:19.200
You left your off-site setup.
Another brick agent had to cover your ass.

40:19.280 --> 40:24.960
The entire surveillance, all the months of
work on this case, gone. Just like you, gone.

40:26.844 --> 40:29.471
This has fourbagger all over it, Mulder.

40:30.320 --> 40:33.400
Censure, transfer, suspension, probation.

40:35.160 --> 40:38.680
I undderstand that leaving my assignment
warrants disciplinary action.

40:38.760 --> 40:42.200
- And I'm willing to accept those measures.
- But?

40:42.600 --> 40:46.080
But I had enough on that survillence
to arrest suspects after three days

40:46.160 --> 40:49.640
I could've nailed them on 40 counts
of bank fraud. But you left me there.

40:49.760 --> 40:52.440
I'm surprising you didn't notice I was gone.

40:52.520 --> 40:57.080
Let alone wiretap my phone,
an illegal procedure without a court order!

41:07.560 --> 41:09.640
Your time is over...

41:09.720 --> 41:11.800
And you leave with nothing.

41:12.920 --> 41:14.400
...and you leave with nothing.

41:17.320 --> 41:19.560
I said, get the hell out.

41:50.480 --> 41:53.080
Report back to your assignment.

41:56.141 --> 41:58.727
A minute ago I was a fourbagger.

42:02.720 --> 42:04.800
Do you want me to make the arrests?

42:05.920 --> 42:08.480
I think we need more to go on.

42:10.360 --> 42:13.280
Continue the surveillance.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.960
It should be right here.

42:43.920 --> 42:46.600
Entire tape is blank.

42:49.600 --> 42:54.040
An electrical surge during the storm
may have degaussed everything...

42:54.120 --> 42:56.960
...erasing the entire tape.

43:01.480 --> 43:04.080
You still have nothing.

43:06.480 --> 43:10.240
I may have not the <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font>, Scully.
But I still have more work.

43:16.960 --> 43:19.720
I still have you.

43:24.040 --> 43:26.600
I still have a myself.

43:31.695 --> 43:35.782
What's the difference
between a lap dance and a table dance?

43:35.866 --> 43:38.660
A lap dance, they're all over you.

43:38.744 --> 43:40.871
A lap dance costs what?

43:41.997 --> 43:45.584
All right, all right.
Tell me the best spot. Where?

43:45.667 --> 43:49.046
- Paramount. But you gotta spend money.
- I'm there.

43:49.963 --> 43:52.674
Wednesday, it's your dancer?

43:53.258 --> 43:56.428
No, don't go Wednesday.
That's amateur night.

43:56.512 --> 43:58.847
Amateurs, huh? Nice touch!

43:58.931 --> 44:02.976
- They're not really amateurs.
- Yeah, sure, sure.

44:03.352 --> 44:07.481
If you don't mind spending the money,
the girls are all over you.

44:07.564 --> 44:10.275
And they're good-looking too...
