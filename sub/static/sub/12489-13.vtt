WEBVTT

00:06.217 --> 00:08.259
BENNETT, DO I HAVE
TO KEEP ASKING YOU
TO FINISH

00:08.259 --> 00:09.510
ASSEMBLING
THE GARDEN SHED?

00:09.510 --> 00:12.343
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
IT'S REALLY YOUR CHOICE.

00:14.185 --> 00:16.057
THANKS FOR THE TOWELS,
DAD.

00:16.057 --> 00:18.269
NOW, I'M GOING TO GET
THE ROPE AND A GLUE GUN.

00:18.269 --> 00:20.771
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO ASK HER WHAT SHE
NEEDS THAT STUFF FOR?

00:20.771 --> 00:23.104
I'M HOPING SHE'S
FINISHING THE SHED.

00:23.104 --> 00:24.485
BENNETT!

00:24.485 --> 00:26.277
IF I WERE HIM,
I'D ASSERT MY DOMINANCE

00:26.277 --> 00:28.359
BY BITING HER ON THE NECK.

00:28.359 --> 00:31.652
MAYBE THAT'S WHY I'VE NEVER
HAD A LONG-TERM GIRLFRIEND.

00:31.652 --> 00:34.205
HONEY, I CAN'T FINISH
THE GARDEN SHED.

00:34.205 --> 00:36.747
I GOT TO GET READY FOR MY
FISHING WEEKEND WITH TYLER.

00:36.747 --> 00:39.290
WHERE ARE THE PILLOWS
THE STRAY CATS WERE BORN ON?

00:39.290 --> 00:41.212
IN THE GARAGE.
THANK YOU.

00:41.212 --> 00:44.375
SO, YOU'RE REALLY DRAGGING
TYLER TO THE LAKE?

00:44.375 --> 00:45.586
YOU KNOW HE'LL HATE IT.

00:45.586 --> 00:47.878
YOU SEE, THIS IS WHY
I NEVER HAD CHILDREN.

00:47.878 --> 00:50.221
WELL THAT AND I NEVER HAD
THE DESIRE AFTER

00:50.221 --> 00:52.973
THAT WEIRD WEEKEND
AT THE VET.

00:52.973 --> 00:55.436
A FATHER AND A SON
HAVE TO BOND,

00:55.436 --> 00:57.808
BUT NOTHING
I'VE TRIED HAS WORKED.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.730
UH, EVEN THAT TECHNIQUE
FROM MY LATEST BOOK:

00:59.730 --> 01:01.812
BEHAVIORAL MIRRORING.

01:01.812 --> 01:05.446
S'UP, BRO?

01:05.446 --> 01:08.449
YOU'RE NOT STRETCHING OUT
MY CLOTHES, ARE YOU?

01:08.449 --> 01:10.191
LITTLE BIT.

01:12.323 --> 01:15.786
I REALLY THINK THIS
FISHING TRIP IS OUR
OPPORTUNITY TO BOND.

01:17.248 --> 01:20.201
NOW I JUST NEED AN AX,
A NINE IRON,
AND YOUR WEDDING DRESS.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.834
THE SECOND ONE.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.836
SWEETIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE?

01:25.836 --> 01:27.668
JUST BUILDING A LITTLE FORT.

01:27.668 --> 01:30.341
AW, THAT'S CUTE.
A LITTLE FORT.

01:34.215 --> 01:37.218
♪♪

01:53.404 --> 01:54.695
( giggling )

01:54.695 --> 01:56.407
HOMEWORK IS FUN WHEN WE
DO IT TOGETHER, LINDSAY.

01:56.407 --> 01:57.998
EVERYTHING IS FUN
WHEN WE DO IT TOGETHER.

01:57.998 --> 02:00.201
Both: EVEN TALKING IS FUN
WHEN WE DO IT TOGETHER.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.834
WON'T IT BE GREAT
WHEN WE'RE BOTH DOCTORS,

02:03.834 --> 02:05.125
AND MARRIED TO TWINS,
AND LIVE ACROSS THE STREET

02:05.125 --> 02:06.547
FROM EACH OTHER?
YEAH.

02:06.547 --> 02:08.169
BUT ONE OF THE TWINS
SHOULD BE A MECHANIC,

02:08.169 --> 02:10.251
SO IF A CAR BREAKS DOWN,
HE CAN FIX IT.

02:10.251 --> 02:13.013
Both:
OOH, A GREASE MONKEY!

02:13.013 --> 02:14.385
( giggling )

02:14.385 --> 02:16.096
BYE, GIRL.
BYE.

02:16.096 --> 02:18.469
AVERY, THE FUNNIEST THING
HAPPENED AT SCHOOL TODAY.

02:18.469 --> 02:19.850
THE CHEERLEADERS
WERE THINKING--

02:19.850 --> 02:21.762
I'M LAUGHING ALREADY.

02:21.762 --> 02:24.265
THEY WERE THINKING OF ASKING
YOU TO BE THEIR NEW FLYER

02:24.265 --> 02:25.726
'CAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND
A HIGH SCHOOL GIRL

02:25.726 --> 02:27.398
SMALL ENOUGH TO THROW UP
IN THE AIR.

02:27.398 --> 02:29.400
I TOLD THEM TO COME OVER
HERE FOR YOUR TRY-OUT.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.861
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

02:30.861 --> 02:32.983
'CAUSE I WANT CHEERLEADERS
AT MY HOUSE.

02:32.983 --> 02:34.655
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.
I GOTTA GO SOAK

02:34.655 --> 02:37.948
A TOWEL IN BODY SPRAY AND
SMACK MYSELF WITH MAN-STINK.

02:37.948 --> 02:39.410
WAIT A MINUTE!

02:39.410 --> 02:41.832
THE CHEERLEADERS ARE
COMING RIGHT NOW?

02:41.832 --> 02:44.375
THE CHEERLEADERS
ARE COMING RIGHT NOW?

02:44.375 --> 02:46.837
YEAH! AND THEY WANT ME
TO BE THEIR FLYER.

02:46.837 --> 02:48.048
( both yelling )

02:48.048 --> 02:49.500
I KNOW I MADE FUN OF
CHEERLEADERS FOR THINKING

02:49.500 --> 02:51.001
THAT THEY'RE BETTER
THAN EVERYBODY ELSE,

02:51.001 --> 02:53.674
BUT NOW I HAVE A CHANCE TO BE
BETTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.925
( yelling )

02:54.925 --> 02:57.388
FINALLY, I'M GOING
TO BE A CHEERLEADER.

02:57.388 --> 02:59.930
DID THAT SOUND LIKE I WAS
LIVING THROUGH YOU?

02:59.930 --> 03:02.263
I TRY SO HARD NOT
TO BE ONE OF THOSE PARENTS.

03:02.263 --> 03:06.146
WE'RE GOING TO BE
A CHEERLEADER.

03:06.146 --> 03:08.979
MOM! PLEASE TELL ME THIS
ISN'T GOING TO BE LIKE

03:08.979 --> 03:10.861
GYMNASTICS WHEN YOU
ATTACKED THE JUDGES.

03:10.861 --> 03:13.694
YOU STUCK THAT LANDING!
MOM!

03:13.694 --> 03:15.986
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M NOT GOING TO
LIVE THROUGH YOU

03:15.986 --> 03:18.529
JUST TO MAKE UP FOR
MY PAST DISAPPOINTMENTS.

03:18.529 --> 03:21.492
I HAVE A PERFECTLY
FULFILLED LIFE--
THEY'RE HERE!

03:21.492 --> 03:23.664
OH!

03:23.664 --> 03:24.875
MOM!

03:24.875 --> 03:26.787
YOU'RE RIGHT,
I'M DOING IT AGAIN.

03:26.787 --> 03:28.419
TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH, ELLEN.

03:30.170 --> 03:31.922
HEY, BRIE, MADDIE.

03:31.922 --> 03:33.924
SO, UM, I DON'T REALLY
KNOW ANY CHEERS,

03:33.924 --> 03:36.507
BUT I DO HAVE SOME
GYMNASTICS EXPERIENCE.

03:36.507 --> 03:39.720
STUCK THE LANDING.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.841
IF YOU WANT TO SHOW
ME SOME CHEERS,

03:40.841 --> 03:42.553
I COULD DEFINITELY
TRY SOMETHING OUT.

03:42.553 --> 03:43.974
OKAY.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.307
YOU'RE IN.

03:46.307 --> 03:49.770
GREAT. IT'S AWESOME
TO BE A PART OF THE TEAM.

03:49.770 --> 03:52.062
THANK YOU. I'M IN!

03:52.062 --> 03:55.356
YOU'RE IN!
YOU'RE IN!
YAY! YAY!

03:55.356 --> 03:57.778
Stan: I WAS HAPPY FOR AVERY
THAT SHE FOUND SOMETHING

03:57.778 --> 03:59.820
SHE WANTED TO BELONG TO.

03:59.820 --> 04:02.703
OF COURSE THE BEST THING IS
TO JOIN SOMETHING WORTHWHILE,

04:02.703 --> 04:06.126
SOMETHING THAT WILL REALLY
MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD.

04:06.126 --> 04:09.249
DO YOU WANT TO JOIN CHLOE'S
MAGIC BLANKET KINGDOM?

04:09.249 --> 04:11.372
DO I?

04:12.753 --> 04:15.376
( knocking on door )
KNOCK, KNOCK. CAN WE COME IN?

04:15.376 --> 04:16.877
STATE YOUR BUSINESS.

04:16.877 --> 04:22.553
I'M A WORLD-RENOWNED
CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST.
PLUS ONE.

04:22.553 --> 04:23.934
YOU MAY ENTER.

04:23.934 --> 04:27.267
CHLOE, THIS IS AMAZING.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.939
BENNETT, SHE'S TAKEN
OVER THE WHOLE KITCHEN.

04:28.939 --> 04:31.271
I WAS GOING TO MAKE MY
BANANA-MUSTARD-BLACK
PEPPER PIE.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.943
ARE YOU SURE YOUR
GRANDMOTHER DIDN'T MEAN

04:32.943 --> 04:35.195
BANANA-CUSTARD-BLACKBERRY
PIE?

04:35.195 --> 04:37.568
YOU HAD A REALLY
BAD PHONE CONNECTION.

04:37.568 --> 04:41.071
BUT I'VE ALWAYS MADE
BANANA-MUSTARD-BLACK
PEPPER PIE.

04:41.071 --> 04:44.074
I KNOW.

04:44.074 --> 04:46.867
THAT PIE IS ILLEGAL
IN MY COUNTRY.

04:46.867 --> 04:50.000
THEN I WOULD LIKE TO APPLY
FOR POLITICAL ASYLUM.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.292
GRANTED.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.127
YOU WANTED
TO TALK TO ME?
YEAH, SON.

04:57.127 --> 05:00.681
WHAT ACTIVITY WOULD
YOU MOST LIKE TO DO
WITH YOUR OLD MAN?

05:00.681 --> 05:02.923
WELL, IT'S NOT GOING
ON A ROLLER COASTER,

05:02.923 --> 05:04.184
BECAUSE YOU
THREW UP ON ME.

05:04.184 --> 05:06.637
IT'S NOT GOING
TO SEE A 3-D MOVIE,

05:06.637 --> 05:09.019
BECAUSE YOU THREW UP
ON ME.

05:09.019 --> 05:10.601
IT'S NOT
PLAYING BOARD GAMES,

05:10.601 --> 05:12.523
BECAUSE YOU THREW UP
ON ME.

05:13.814 --> 05:18.028
MY HIPPO HAD
JUST GORGED ITSELF.
IT WAS DISGUSTING.

05:18.028 --> 05:21.992
NO. SON, YOU AND I
ARE GOING FISHING
THIS WEEKEND.

05:21.992 --> 05:25.826
YOU AND ME IN THE HOT
SUN ON A ROCKING BOAT
WITH SMELLY FISH

05:25.826 --> 05:27.448
AND A BUCKET
OF WORMS?

05:27.448 --> 05:29.079
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
THROW UP ON ME NOW
AND GET IT OVER WITH?

05:29.079 --> 05:31.712
WE'RE GOING,
WE'RE BONDING,

05:31.712 --> 05:33.584
AND YOU'RE
GOING TO LOVE IT.
YOU'LL SEE.

05:33.584 --> 05:35.956
IT'LL JUST BE LIKE--
OH.

05:35.956 --> 05:40.551
OH, I AM TASTING BANANA-
MUSTARD-BLACK PEPPER PIE.

05:41.962 --> 05:44.094
I'M GOOD.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.226
NO, I'M NOT.

05:52.062 --> 05:55.025
YEAH. WHEN THE GIRLS
RELEASE ME INTO THE AIR,

05:55.025 --> 05:56.477
TIME SLOWS DOWN,
AND I FEEL LIKE

05:56.477 --> 05:58.108
ICARUS RACING
TOWARDS THE SUN.

06:00.150 --> 06:02.152
IT'S, LIKE, TOTALLY FUN
BEING A CHEERLEADER.

06:02.152 --> 06:04.985
( laughing )

06:04.985 --> 06:07.287
AVERY, THOSE WERE
THE CUTE BOYS!

06:07.287 --> 06:09.620
BEFORE YOU WERE A CHEERLEADER,
THEY NEVER NOTICED YOU!

06:09.620 --> 06:11.872
DON'T HATE ME IF
I'M A TAD JEALOUS.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.755
LINDSAY, I COULDN'T HATE YOU,
EVEN IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY

06:14.755 --> 06:17.918
MIXED UP OUR TWIN
HUSBANDS AND KISSED
THE WRONG ONE.

06:17.918 --> 06:20.631
OH, HEY! DON'T FORGET OUR
CLEAN UP THE PARK EVENT.

06:20.631 --> 06:24.304
HOW COULD I? I ALREADY
PAINTED HAPPY FACES
ON OUR HAZ-MAT MASKS.

06:24.304 --> 06:27.508
Both: THESE MAKE PROTECTION
FROM CHEMICAL INHALATION CUTE.

06:27.508 --> 06:28.849
( laughing )

06:28.849 --> 06:30.431
( clearing throat )

06:30.431 --> 06:32.893
OH, UH, HEY, GUYS.
YOU KNOW LINDSAY, RIGHT?

06:32.893 --> 06:35.896
YEAH, SHE'S YOUR LITTLE
FRIEND WHO TALKS AT
THE SAME TIME AS YOU, RIGHT?

06:35.896 --> 06:39.520
Both: YEAH, WE DO THAT. I DON'T
REALLY KNOW HOW IT HAPPENS.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.783
ANYWAY, AVES, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE CALLING YOU NOW, "AVES."

06:42.783 --> 06:43.904
WANNA SIT WITH US
AT LUNCH TODAY?

06:43.904 --> 06:46.026
YOU HAVE TO,
IT'S NOT A QUESTION.

06:47.027 --> 06:49.740
OH, UH, CAN MY BFF COME, TOO?

06:49.740 --> 06:51.582
I'D LOVE FOR LINDS
TO BE IN ON THE FUN.

06:51.582 --> 06:53.914
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CALLING
HER NOW: "LINDS."

06:53.914 --> 06:55.956
SORRY,
CHEERLEADER MEETING.

06:55.956 --> 06:57.377
OH SORRY, LINDSAY.

06:57.377 --> 07:00.591
NO, IT'S A CHEERLEADER
MEETING, IT'S COOL.

07:00.591 --> 07:01.882
I'LL SEE YOU LATER,
AVES.

07:01.882 --> 07:03.133
SEE YOU, LINDS.

07:03.133 --> 07:04.885
All: BYE.
BYE.

07:04.885 --> 07:07.097
OKAY. WE'RE NOT
CALLING YOU AVES ANYMORE.
SHE RUINED IT.

07:07.097 --> 07:08.929
YOUR NEW NICKNAME
IS "AVERY."

07:08.929 --> 07:12.432
OH, I LIKE THAT.
I HOPE IT CATCHES ON.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.815
LOOK, AVERY, IT'S NOT REALLY
A CHEERLEADER MEETING,

07:14.815 --> 07:15.816
WE JUST DON'T
LIKE LINDSAY.

07:15.816 --> 07:18.729
WE DON'T.
NOT AT ALL.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.270
BUT SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

07:20.270 --> 07:21.902
IF YOU HANG OUT WITH HER,
YOU CAN'T HANG OUT WITH US.

07:21.902 --> 07:24.024
IT'S ALL PART
OF OUR SCHOOL SPIRIT.

07:24.024 --> 07:26.026
All:
SPIRIT.

07:37.377 --> 07:40.631
WELL, THE FORT'S DONE.
WHOO!
YEAH.

07:40.631 --> 07:41.792
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

07:41.792 --> 07:44.004
HUH?
OH, LET'S NAME OUR COUNTRY.

07:44.004 --> 07:48.178
OKAY, LET'S SEE. MY NAME'S
CHLOE, YOUR NAME'S STAN.

07:48.178 --> 07:50.721
LET'S NAME IT...
"CHLOE."

07:51.762 --> 07:53.514
UH, WHERE'S MY NAME?

07:53.514 --> 07:56.226
YOUR NAME CAN BE IN
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

07:56.226 --> 08:01.101
♪ CHLOE CHLOE CHLOE CHLOE CHLOE
CHLOE CHLOE STAN ♪

08:01.101 --> 08:03.524
WELL, AT LEAST MY NAME
IS THE BIG FINISH.

08:03.524 --> 08:07.407
♪ CHLOE ♪

08:07.407 --> 08:09.820
AH, THAT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

08:09.820 --> 08:13.574
SO WE HAVE A NAME AND A NATIONAL
ANTHEM. WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

08:13.574 --> 08:15.536
WE NEED AN ENEMY TO CONQUER.

08:15.536 --> 08:17.618
Bennett: HEY, CHLOE.
IT'S DADDY AND MOMMY.

08:21.331 --> 08:23.293
PERFECT.

08:24.294 --> 08:25.505
ARE THEY IN THERE?

08:25.505 --> 08:28.549
I THINK SO.
I CAN HEAR CHLOE'S VOICE.

08:28.549 --> 08:29.550
AH!

08:34.304 --> 08:36.516
I CLAIM THE FAMILY ROOM
IN THE NAME OF CHLOE!

08:36.516 --> 08:38.729
OH! CHLOE!

08:38.729 --> 08:41.852
WE'RE LETTING YOU
PLAY IN THE KITCHEN.
DON'T PUSH IT.

08:41.852 --> 08:45.235
RETREAT! RETREAT! RETREAT!

08:51.071 --> 08:52.653
STAN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:52.653 --> 08:57.157
THE CONFLICT DRAGS ON, MORALE IS
LOW, AND SUPPLIES ARE DWINDLING.

08:57.157 --> 08:58.959
I DON'T THINK WE'LL MAKE IT
THROUGH THE WINTER.

08:58.959 --> 09:01.501
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

09:01.501 --> 09:03.834
LOOK, STAN,
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

09:03.834 --> 09:07.217
THE CHEERLEADERS ARE COMING
OVER TONIGHT FOR A SLEEP-OVER

09:07.217 --> 09:09.630
AND I LOVE BEING ONE OF THEM,

09:09.630 --> 09:11.672
BUT THEY SAY I CAN'T BE FRIENDS
WITH LINDSAY ANYMORE.

09:11.672 --> 09:15.175
WELL, AS A DOG,
I VALUE LOYALTY ABOVE ALL.

09:15.175 --> 09:20.060
Chloe: COUCH CUSHIONS!
BRING ME MORE COUCH CUSHIONS!

09:20.060 --> 09:23.353
WHY ELSE WOULD I FOLLOW THAT
CRAZY, RED-HEADED TYRANT

09:23.353 --> 09:26.817
INTO A BATTLE
THAT CAN'T BE WON?

09:26.817 --> 09:28.989
AVERY, LINDSAY'S YOUR
BEST FRIEND.

09:28.989 --> 09:30.570
YOU CAN'T TURN YOUR
BACK ON HER.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.453
I CAN BE FRIENDS
WITH LINDSAY AND STILL
BE A CHEERLEADER.

09:33.453 --> 09:36.116
I'VE JUST GOT TO KEEP
MY TWO WORLDS SEPARATE.

09:36.116 --> 09:39.870
Chloe: STAN, BRING THEM NOW
OR I'LL HAVE YOU SHAVED!

09:40.911 --> 09:43.543
YOU DO NOT WANT
TO SEE ME SHAVED.

09:43.543 --> 09:45.255
I'VE GOT A COUPLE
TATTOOS I REGRET.

09:45.255 --> 09:46.797
ONE'S A PINK UNICORN,

09:46.797 --> 09:50.170
AND THE OTHER ONE'S
EMBARRASSING.

09:52.472 --> 09:54.514
BASS MASTER
BENNETT JAMES HERE,

09:54.514 --> 09:57.057
REELING IN THE BIG ONE.

09:57.057 --> 09:59.019
OH!

10:00.771 --> 10:01.772
DAD?

10:01.772 --> 10:03.563
HEY! OH, HEY, HEY, HEY.

10:03.563 --> 10:07.357
HEY, HEY YOU, SON.
HEY. HEY.

10:07.357 --> 10:10.570
READY FOR A WEEKEND
WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER? OH!

10:10.570 --> 10:12.653
AND I HAVE NOT EATEN A THING
TODAY, SO NOTHING WILL

10:12.653 --> 10:15.285
BE COMING UP BUT BILE.

10:15.285 --> 10:18.659
AND, UH,
A LITTLE BIT OF RICE.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.240
DO WE HAVE TO GO NOW?

10:20.240 --> 10:22.452
THE CHEERLEADERS
ARE COMING HERE
FOR A SLEEP-OVER.

10:22.452 --> 10:24.454
OH! TOO BAD.
WE'RE GOING FISHING.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.417
COULD THIS GET ANY WORSE?

10:27.417 --> 10:32.462
WELL, YEAH. I'VE GOT
A FISH HOOK STUCK
IN MY BUTT CHEEK.

10:32.462 --> 10:35.886
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A PAIR OF PLIERS
AND A FLASHLIGHT, SON.

10:35.886 --> 10:38.558
OH, COME ON!

10:40.891 --> 10:43.643
ARE THE CHEERLEADERS
HERE YET?

10:43.643 --> 10:46.316
NO, YOU'RE THE FIRST
TO ARRIVE.

10:48.358 --> 10:49.980
WHEN DID YOU
GET THAT UNIFORM?

10:49.980 --> 10:51.822
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU NEVER MADE THE SQUAD.

10:51.822 --> 10:54.614
I WAS THE UNOFFICIAL BACKUP
IN CASE ONE OF THE EIGHT

10:54.614 --> 10:57.868
CHEERLEADERS GOT THE FLU
OR WAS ACCIDENTALLY

10:57.868 --> 11:00.620
HANDCUFFED TO THE FLAGPOLE.

11:00.620 --> 11:03.914
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME
THEY'D GO WITH JUST SEVEN.

11:03.914 --> 11:07.127
UM, THE CHEERLEADERS
ARE MY THING, REMEMBER?

11:07.127 --> 11:09.589
OF COURSE THEY ARE. YES.
YOU'RE THE KID, I'M THE MOM.

11:09.589 --> 11:11.922
THIS IS YOUR TIME
TO SHINE, NOT--

11:11.922 --> 11:15.595
THEY'RE HERE!
THEY'RE HERE!
OH!

11:15.595 --> 11:18.138
OH, IT'S YOU.

11:18.138 --> 11:19.599
WHAT'S YOUR MOTHER LOOKING FOR?

11:19.599 --> 11:23.724
HER YOUTH.
MOM, WOULD YOU PLEASE CHANGE?

11:23.724 --> 11:26.436
AND PUT ON SOME
OTHER CLOTHES, TOO.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.859
FINE. CALL ME WHEN
THE CHEERLEADERS GET HERE.

11:28.859 --> 11:32.072
OH, ARE THE CHEERLEADERS COMING
OVER TO HELP CLEAN UP THE PARK?

11:32.072 --> 11:36.526
HERE'S YOUR TRASH SPIKE.
I SPENT ALL NIGHT BEDAZZLING IT.

11:36.526 --> 11:37.738
WAS THAT TODAY?

11:37.738 --> 11:39.489
YOU FORGOT?

11:39.489 --> 11:42.783
YEAH. I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY.
WE'LL DO IT ANOTHER DAY, OKAY?

11:42.783 --> 11:44.664
SO YOU'RE BLOWING ME OFF?

11:44.664 --> 11:46.586
WELL, I CAN'T BLOW OFF
THE CHEERLEADERS.

11:46.586 --> 11:49.039
THEY ALWAYS DO THIS SLEEP-OVER
AT THE NEW GIRL'S HOUSE.

11:49.039 --> 11:51.001
IF YOU COULD JUST GO
BEFORE THEY GET HERE.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.672
YOU'RE KICKING ME OUT?

11:52.672 --> 11:54.544
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR IT TO COME OUT THAT WAY.

11:54.544 --> 11:57.637
I JUST DON'T WANT
YOU HERE WHEN THEY COME.

11:57.637 --> 11:59.970
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
DOING THIS TO ME.

11:59.970 --> 12:02.392
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT
UNDERSTANDING HOW IMPORTANT

12:02.392 --> 12:03.804
BEING A CHEERLEADER IS TO ME.

12:03.804 --> 12:06.556
Both: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
BEING SUCH A BAD FRIEND.

12:06.556 --> 12:08.398
Both: ME?
YEAH, YOU!

12:08.398 --> 12:09.729
( doorbell rings )

12:09.729 --> 12:12.983
IF YOU WANT ME OUT OF HERE
SO BADLY, I'M LEAVING.

12:12.983 --> 12:15.315
BUT DON'T EXPECT ME
TO BE HAPPY ABOUT IT.

12:21.491 --> 12:25.625
WELL, I GUESS I JUST
LOST MY BEST FRIEND.

12:25.625 --> 12:27.497
THAT'S THE SCHOOL SPIRIT.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.668
All:
SPIRIT!

12:30.330 --> 12:32.502
OH, AVERY.

12:37.297 --> 12:40.550
YOU RUINED OUR BONDING TRIP.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

12:40.550 --> 12:42.182
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT.

12:42.182 --> 12:43.553
LOOK AT ALL
THESE FISH WE CAUGHT.

12:43.553 --> 12:44.975
SON, WE DIDN'T
CATCH THEM.

12:44.975 --> 12:46.847
WE WERE ARGUING
SO MUCH THE OTHER
FISHERMEN THREW THEM

12:46.847 --> 12:49.309
AT US TO GET US
OFF THE LAKE.

12:49.309 --> 12:50.650
WE STILL CAUGHT THEM.

12:53.653 --> 12:55.605
OOH, THE CHEERLEADERS
ARE IN THEIR PAJAMAS.

12:55.605 --> 12:57.777
I THOUGHT YOUR STUPID
FISHING TRIP WOULD
MAKE ME MISS THIS

12:57.777 --> 12:59.659
BUT WE GOT BACK
IN TIME!

12:59.659 --> 13:02.532
UGH, I'M DISGUSTING,
I CAN'T LET THEM
SEE ME LIKE THIS.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.034
AS LONG AS YOU'RE IN THERE,
TURN ON THE LIGHT.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.405
YOU CAN HELP ME
HANG THIS DOOR.

13:05.405 --> 13:06.616
I DON'T WANT
TO HANG THE DOOR.

13:06.616 --> 13:08.578
I DON'T EITHER.
LET'S BOND OVER THAT.

13:10.370 --> 13:11.501
( all laughing )

13:11.501 --> 13:14.374
( all sighing )

13:15.465 --> 13:17.547
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS,
LINDSAY'S REALLY NOT THAT BAD

13:17.547 --> 13:20.841
ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HER.
SHE JUST WANTS TO BE LIKE US.

13:20.841 --> 13:24.094
EVERYBODY WANTS
TO BE LIKE US,
BUT NOT EVERYONE CAN.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.095
RIGHT, GIRLS?

13:25.095 --> 13:26.636
YEAH.
TOTALLY.

13:26.636 --> 13:28.348
YOU GO, BRIE!

13:29.689 --> 13:31.271
MOM!
WHAT?

13:31.271 --> 13:33.433
OH! I'M DOING IT AGAIN,
AREN'T I? I'M SORRY.

13:33.433 --> 13:35.065
I'M GOING UP TO BED.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.276
GOOD NIGHT, MADS.

13:36.276 --> 13:37.277
GOOD NIGHT, ELLS.

13:37.277 --> 13:38.278
YES!

13:40.440 --> 13:42.362
( grunts )
HA-HA.

13:42.362 --> 13:45.325
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
YOUR MOM'S FACE
WHEN SHE SEES THIS.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.617
YOU NEVER FINISH
WHAT YOU START.

13:47.617 --> 13:49.950
WELL, I FINISHED THIS,
BOOM!

13:51.501 --> 13:52.752
( groaning )

13:57.507 --> 14:02.132
OH, SHOOT. WE CAN'T OPEN
THE DOOR BECAUSE WE PUT
THE HINGES ON BACKWARDS.

14:03.133 --> 14:04.514
( grunts )

14:07.517 --> 14:11.311
OH, GREAT, WE CAN'T
UNSCREW THE HINGES BECAUSE
THE BATTERY'S DEAD.

14:11.311 --> 14:14.975
AND SOMEBODY MADE US
LEAVE OUR CELL PHONES
BEHIND SO WE COULD BOND.

14:14.975 --> 14:16.026
( groaning )

14:16.026 --> 14:18.358
NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO POINT FINGERS.

14:18.358 --> 14:21.781
NOW IS THE TIME TO SCREAM
IN KIND OF A CRAZY PANIC.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.615
HELP! HONEY! HONEY!

14:25.615 --> 14:27.407
HELP! HELP!
GET US OUT OF HERE!

14:27.407 --> 14:29.199
♪ YOU GOT TO GET
LOW, LOW, LOW ♪

14:29.199 --> 14:30.870
♪ YOU GOT TO GET
LOW, LOW, LOW ♪

14:30.870 --> 14:32.542
Both:
WE'RE STUCK IN THE SHED!

14:32.542 --> 14:34.794
WE'RE STUCK IN THE SHED!

14:34.794 --> 14:38.088
♪ YOU GOT TO GET
LOW, LOW, LOW ♪

14:38.088 --> 14:40.380
( yelling )

14:45.135 --> 14:48.178
GOOD, YOU'RE UP.
WE HAVE TO PUT ON A PLAY

14:48.178 --> 14:50.220
TO TEACH AVERY
A LESSON ABOUT LOYALTY.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.352
I'VE BEEN UP
ALL NIGHT WRITING IT.

14:52.352 --> 14:55.065
I'M ONLY DOING IT IF I CAN PLAY
A GRIZZLED OLD MOUNTAIN MAN.

14:55.065 --> 14:57.517
UH, OKAY, FINE.

14:57.517 --> 14:59.729
AWESOME!

14:59.729 --> 15:03.283
DOES MY BEARD
SMELL FUNNY TO YOU?

15:04.654 --> 15:07.447
IT'S BEEN FUN BEING
PART OF THIS KINGDOM,

15:07.447 --> 15:09.990
BUT I GOT A BETTER OFFER
TO JOIN ANOTHER KINGDOM--

15:09.990 --> 15:13.333
CHEERLANDIA.

15:13.333 --> 15:14.534
SO, I'M OUT OF HERE.

15:14.534 --> 15:17.917
GRRR, I'M A MOUNTAIN MAN.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.340
I GROW MOSS
IN MY BELLY BUTTON.

15:22.002 --> 15:24.884
I KNOW IT'S UNEXPECTED,
HURTS YOUR FEELINGS,

15:24.884 --> 15:27.597
AND IS A SHOCKING
ACT OF DISLOYALTY.

15:27.597 --> 15:29.889
I POOP IN THE WOODS.

15:31.261 --> 15:33.974
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
I SEE WHAT YOU GUYS ARE

15:33.974 --> 15:35.935
DOING HERE WITH
YOUR LITTLE DRAMA,

15:35.935 --> 15:37.357
AND IT ISN'T
VERY CONVINCING.

15:37.357 --> 15:39.269
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU'RE DUMPING LINDSAY

15:39.269 --> 15:40.820
FOR THE CHEERLEADERS.

15:40.820 --> 15:42.612
YOU DUMPED YOUR BEST FRIEND?

15:42.612 --> 15:44.944
IT'S NOT THAT
I DUMPED HER.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.237
IT'S JUST I GOT
SOME NEW FRIENDS...

15:47.237 --> 15:48.198
IT'S COMPLICATED.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.120
BUT, YOU'RE
MY BIG SISTER, AVERY.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.282
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO
THE RIGHT THING.

15:52.282 --> 15:55.125
CHLOE, SOMETIMES
THINGS CHANGE--

15:55.125 --> 15:57.247
BUT I WANTED
TO BE LIKE YOU.

15:58.628 --> 16:00.380
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT.

16:00.380 --> 16:04.174
IN SCHOOL, I WROTE YOUR NAME
FOR THE PERSON I ADMIRE MOST.

16:09.889 --> 16:12.432
THIS IS THE BEST PLAY
I HAVE EVER WRITTEN.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.478
GOOD. I'M GLAD
YOU GUYS ARE UP.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.440
I'M NOT GIVING UP
LINDSAY AS A FRIEND.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.941
THEN YOU CAN'T
BE A CHEERLEADER.

16:21.941 --> 16:24.814
YES, I CAN. I'M THE ONLY
GIRL WHO'S SMALL ENOUGH

16:24.814 --> 16:25.815
TO BE A FLYER.

16:25.815 --> 16:27.197
( gasping )

16:27.197 --> 16:28.238
HOW DARE YOU THREATEN US.

16:28.238 --> 16:30.450
HOW DARE YOU CALL US
NOT SMALL ENOUGH.

16:31.911 --> 16:33.573
EITHER I'M STILL
FRIENDS WITH LINDSAY,

16:33.573 --> 16:35.285
OR I QUIT
THE CHEERLEADERS.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.877
WE DON'T NEED YOU. WE'LL JUST
FIND SOMEONE ELSE WE CAN LIFT.

16:37.877 --> 16:40.120
REMY.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.501
ONE, TWO, THREE.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.083
( grunting )

16:44.174 --> 16:46.926
FINE, WE'RE
BEST FRIENDS AGAIN.

16:46.926 --> 16:48.928
All:
SPIRIT!

16:52.802 --> 16:54.634
Stan:
WAY TO GO, AVERY!

17:00.190 --> 17:01.441
AHH!
AHH!

17:01.441 --> 17:03.733
OH, WELL WE'RE
STILL IN HERE.

17:03.733 --> 17:05.405
IT WASN'T A DREAM.

17:05.405 --> 17:07.647
WHY HAVEN'T THEY
COME LOOKING FOR US?

17:07.647 --> 17:09.409
BECAUSE AS FAR AS THEY KNOW,

17:09.409 --> 17:12.742
WE'RE AT THE LAKE
UNTIL TOMORROW.

17:12.742 --> 17:14.704
WHAT SMELLS
LIKE ROTTING FISH?

17:14.704 --> 17:18.328
IT MIGHT BE
THE ROTTING FISH, SON.

17:18.328 --> 17:22.712
LISTEN, I'M, I'M SORRY
I DRAGGED YOU INTO THIS.

17:22.712 --> 17:25.425
MAYBE I WAS
TRYING TOO HARD.

17:25.425 --> 17:28.668
THE THING IS,
I NEVER DID ANYTHING
LIKE THIS WITH MY DAD.

17:28.668 --> 17:31.881
REALLY? YOU NEVER GOT
TRAPPED IN A SHED
IN HUNDRED DEGREE HEAT

17:31.881 --> 17:33.973
WITH ROTTING FISH
AND NO HOPE OF GETTING RESCUED?

17:33.973 --> 17:36.806
EH, WE JUST
WEREN'T THAT CLOSE.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.350
AND I WANTED
MORE FOR YOU AND ME.

17:40.350 --> 17:43.183
IT'S FRUSTRATING
FOR ME BECAUSE

17:43.183 --> 17:45.395
YOU NEVER TELL
ME WHAT'S GOING ON,

17:45.395 --> 17:47.317
YOU, YOU NEVER LET ME IN.

17:47.317 --> 17:51.651
I MEAN, WE'VE GOT SUCH
A STRAINED RELATIONSHIP.

17:51.651 --> 17:54.694
WE DO?

17:54.694 --> 17:56.286
I THOUGHT WE WERE
REALLY CLOSE.

17:56.286 --> 17:57.957
REALLY!

17:59.249 --> 18:04.204
YEAH. I MEAN, I LOVE YOU
AND EVERYTHING.

18:04.204 --> 18:05.965
IF I HEARD THAT THREE DAYS AGO,
WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD

18:05.965 --> 18:07.967
TO GO ON THIS STUPID
FISHING TRIP.

18:09.629 --> 18:12.672
I LOVE YOU, TOO...
AND EVERYTHING.

18:12.672 --> 18:15.345
YOU KNOW, I'M KINDA
GLAD WE GOT TO HAVE
THIS MOMENT BEFORE

18:15.345 --> 18:16.886
WE ROT IN HERE
WITH THESE FISH.

18:16.886 --> 18:19.679
HEY! WE ARE NOT
GOING TO ROT IN HERE.

18:19.679 --> 18:23.523
COME ON. WE ARE STRONG,
WE'RE RESOURCEFUL,

18:23.523 --> 18:26.486
WE NEVER GIVE UP.
WE'RE JAMES MEN.

18:26.486 --> 18:27.897
LET'S SEE IF
WE CAN FIND
SOMETHING TO--

18:27.897 --> 18:30.280
SNAKE!
( yelling )

18:41.201 --> 18:45.295
WE'RE FREE!
WE'RE GONNA LIVE!
( coughing )

18:45.295 --> 18:47.337
YOU OKAY, DAD?
YEAH. YEAH.

18:47.337 --> 18:49.299
I, I THINK SO.

18:49.299 --> 18:52.512
SOMEDAY, SON, WHEN YOU TELL
THIS STORY, AND BY SOMEDAY,

18:52.512 --> 18:55.515
I MEAN IN FIVE MINUTES
WHEN YOU TALK TO YOUR MOM,

18:55.515 --> 18:59.179
IT WAS A SNAKE,
NOT A GARDEN HOSE.

19:02.312 --> 19:03.313
DAD?

19:03.313 --> 19:06.226
YES, SON, GO.

19:06.226 --> 19:07.767
GO TO THE CHEERLEADERS.

19:08.978 --> 19:10.570
I'M GONNA GO THROW UP.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.194
HEY, YOU GOT TO ADMIT,

19:14.194 --> 19:16.115
THAT DOOR STAYED
ON PRETTY GOOD,
THOUGH, HUH?

19:18.368 --> 19:20.990
HEY, GIRLS.
HOW WAS THE SLEEP-OVER?

19:20.990 --> 19:23.122
EW!
WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

19:23.122 --> 19:25.455
IT'S LIKE A COW
POOPED A FISH!

19:25.455 --> 19:27.917
( girls screaming )

19:27.917 --> 19:29.419
WAIT! WAIT! I, I--

19:29.419 --> 19:31.961
I USUALLY SMELL
SO MUCH BETTER!

19:31.961 --> 19:35.215
THERE'S A MAN THROWING UP
OUT THERE!

19:35.215 --> 19:36.716
( continued screaming )

19:42.562 --> 19:43.563
( blowing whistle )

19:43.563 --> 19:44.974
READY?

19:44.974 --> 19:46.226
Cheerleaders:
OKAY.

19:46.226 --> 19:50.940
BE MY "F", BE MY "R", BE
MY "I", "E", "N", "D."

19:50.940 --> 19:52.612
WHAT'S THAT SPELL?
BE MY FRIEND!

19:52.612 --> 19:55.315
GO LINDSAY,
BE AVERY'S FRIEND!

19:55.315 --> 19:57.367
( cheering )

19:57.367 --> 19:59.158
THANKS, GUYS.

19:59.158 --> 20:00.490
THAT WAS WORSE THAN
WHEN THEY MADE US CHEER

20:00.490 --> 20:01.871
THAT STUPID
BAKE SALE.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.497
YOU EXPECT ME TO FORGIVE
YOU JUST LIKE THAT,

20:07.497 --> 20:09.249
AFTER THE WAY
YOU BETRAYED ME?

20:09.249 --> 20:12.332
LOOK, LINDSAY,
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY.

20:12.332 --> 20:14.544
I GUESS I JUST GOT
SO CAUGHT UP IN BEING

20:14.544 --> 20:17.257
A CHEERLEADER
I FORGOT WHO I WAS

20:17.257 --> 20:18.388
AND WHAT WE MEANT
TO EACH OTHER.

20:18.388 --> 20:20.179
I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE THAT SHALLOW.

20:20.179 --> 20:23.182
I THOUGHT WE
WERE THE SAME,
BUT I GUESS WE'RE NOT.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.476
I GOT YOU INVITED TO
THE CHEERLEADER SLEEP-OVER

20:26.476 --> 20:28.518
AT BRIE'S
HOUSE NEXT WEEK.

20:28.518 --> 20:32.942
AVERY, YOU'RE
MY BEST FRIEND EVER!

20:32.942 --> 20:34.654
SO YOU FORGIVE ME?

20:34.654 --> 20:37.236
OF COURSE I DO.
I GUESS THROWING AWAY
EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVE IN

20:37.236 --> 20:39.238
TO BE WITH THE CHEERLEADERS
ISN'T SHALLOW.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.450
IT'S FLEXIBLE.

20:40.450 --> 20:43.122
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD MYSELF.
( gasps )

20:43.122 --> 20:44.784
Both:
WE ARE THE SAME!

20:44.784 --> 20:46.326
( screaming )

20:47.707 --> 20:50.169
Both:
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

20:50.169 --> 20:54.634
HELLO, LADIES.
( screaming )

20:54.634 --> 20:56.426
DO I STILL SMELL THAT BAD?

20:57.877 --> 20:59.879
( cats meowing )

21:05.595 --> 21:07.727
OH, COME ON!

21:11.020 --> 21:13.152
Stan: I HAVE NEVER SPENT
SUCH A HORRIBLE NIGHT

21:13.152 --> 21:15.895
IN THE THEATER AS
LAST TUESDAY.

21:15.895 --> 21:19.198
I'M SORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING,
LITTLE MOUNTAIN MAN.

21:19.198 --> 21:21.361
I WILL NEVER LET
YOU DOWN AGAIN.

21:21.361 --> 21:22.532
( spitting sound )

21:24.113 --> 21:27.497
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE MY HERO,
BIG MOUNTAIN SIS.

21:27.497 --> 21:31.411
NOW, LET'S GO HOLLOW OUT
A BEAR TO SLEEP IN.

21:31.411 --> 21:33.082
( spitting sounds )

21:33.082 --> 21:34.293
( yelling )

21:35.545 --> 21:37.917
I DID NOT WRITE THAT.
