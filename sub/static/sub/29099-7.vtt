PENNYWORTH#107
"Julie Christie"
Closed Captioned

00:10.793 --> 00:11.750
Oh!

00:11.794 --> 00:14.057
My card.
Pennyworth Security.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.493
HARWOOD:
My name is Lord Harwood.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.713
We need men like you.

00:17.756 --> 00:18.757
ESME:
I don't know anything.

00:18.801 --> 00:19.758
Please don't hurt me.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.720
Who is the leader

00:24.763 --> 00:26.243
of the Raven Society?

00:26.287 --> 00:27.549
I'm the leader.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.248
SYKES:
It is you,

00:31.292 --> 00:33.076
isn't it?
Lord Harwood.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.078
What's going on?

00:35.122 --> 00:37.472
I know him.
He's me old boss.

00:37.515 --> 00:39.300
Oh, aye?

00:39.343 --> 00:42.303
So you want to call a truce?We do. Sincerely.

00:42.346 --> 00:46.611
That man tortured me.
He destroyed my life.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.265
H-He has to die.

00:48.309 --> 00:51.616
CURZON:
Do you really think
Esme died by accident?

00:51.660 --> 00:52.965
Who hates you

00:53.009 --> 00:55.272
so much that your death
isn't enough?

00:55.316 --> 00:59.146
What do you see?

00:59.189 --> 01:00.625
My God.

01:00.669 --> 01:02.366
He has been waiting all this
time to write me back.

01:02.410 --> 01:03.889
"A little too late, my friend.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.500
I'm glad you
know the truth."

01:05.543 --> 01:06.544
THOMAS:
Why is a nice American

01:06.588 --> 01:07.545
society girl like you mixed up

01:07.589 --> 01:08.720
with the No-Name League?

01:08.764 --> 01:10.200
I could ask the same of you.

01:10.244 --> 01:11.680
THOMAS:
This is my sister
Patricia.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.334
Could I leave her with
you for a few hours?

01:13.377 --> 01:15.945
PATRICIA:
Do you like parties, Martha?

01:15.988 --> 01:17.468
Who the hell isthis guy?

01:17.512 --> 01:19.383
PATRICIA:
Alistair is a Satanist.

01:19.427 --> 01:20.471
Oh, I love her already.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.928
♪ Well, you've got
your diamonds ♪

01:42.972 --> 01:47.281
♪ And you've got
your pretty clothes ♪

01:47.324 --> 01:51.198
♪ And the chauffeur drives
your car ♪

01:51.241 --> 01:55.680
♪ You let everybody know

01:55.724 --> 01:59.510
♪ But don't play with me

01:59.554 --> 02:01.817

02:03.949 --> 02:07.736
♪ So, don't you play with me

02:07.779 --> 02:10.739
♪ 'Cause you're playing
with fire. ♪

02:10.782 --> 02:11.740
THOMAS: Thank God!

02:11.783 --> 02:13.698
Where have you been?

02:13.742 --> 02:15.135
What the hell?
Where's Patricia?

02:15.178 --> 02:16.223
What-- where are
your clothes?

02:19.400 --> 02:20.357
Jesus, are you okay?

02:20.401 --> 02:21.402
What the hell happened to you?

02:21.445 --> 02:24.144
I'm fine.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.624
Calm down.

02:26.668 --> 02:27.625
What are you doing

02:27.669 --> 02:29.061
in my apartment?

02:29.105 --> 02:31.934
Calm down?
I thought you were dead.

02:31.977 --> 02:33.065
I've been worried sick.

02:36.417 --> 02:39.811
We went out to a party, and I
guess things got a little wild.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.813
Got a little wild?
You are naked!

02:41.857 --> 02:43.511
Where is Patricia?

02:43.554 --> 02:47.036
Patricia is a lunatic,
but she's a grown woman.

02:47.079 --> 02:49.778
I'm not her nanny,
and you're not her father,

02:49.821 --> 02:52.520
and anyway, what was I
supposed to do?

02:52.563 --> 02:54.391
I'm sure Patricia's just...

02:54.435 --> 02:56.828
sleeping it off
someplace.

02:56.872 --> 02:58.917
Oh, unbelievable.
The irresponsibility!

02:58.961 --> 03:01.529
Please.

03:01.572 --> 03:04.053
Like you never got drunk
and lost track of time.

03:04.096 --> 03:06.360
You have been gone
for three days!

03:06.403 --> 03:08.013
Three days? What are
you talking about?

03:08.057 --> 03:10.233
Today's Saturday.Martha, it's Monday.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.800
No.
Monday!

03:16.413 --> 03:19.024
What the fuck?

03:19.068 --> 03:21.157
What the hell
happened to you?

03:21.201 --> 03:22.593
Where is Patricia?

04:43.892 --> 04:44.849
Anything?

04:44.893 --> 04:46.416
Nothing.Daveboy?

04:46.460 --> 04:48.375
Nope, nothing, Alfie, sorry.

04:51.073 --> 04:52.509
There's got to be something.
Tell us where he's hiding.

04:59.777 --> 05:00.691
Alfie?

05:05.348 --> 05:07.045
What is it?

05:24.193 --> 05:25.803
The bastard wore it
like a medal.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.111
I don't understand.

05:30.242 --> 05:32.157
All you done
was make a joke.

05:35.639 --> 05:38.120
It was just a joke.

05:43.691 --> 05:45.736
Laugh's on me, eh?

05:49.827 --> 05:51.307
The witch was right.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.140
It's my fault Esme's dead.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.840
And now he's playing with me.

06:05.582 --> 06:08.977
He's the cat.
And I'm the mouse.

06:10.805 --> 06:13.634
BAZZA:
Alfie?

06:13.677 --> 06:16.550
Look around you.

06:16.593 --> 06:17.507
The man's crazy.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.555
There's no reason
in crazy.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.617
I don't even know
his first name.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.184
I just clean his
house. That's all.

06:42.227 --> 06:44.708
Mondays and Thursdays.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.101
You're not a very
good cleaner.

06:46.144 --> 06:49.844
Mr. Curzon is
very particular.

06:49.887 --> 06:52.194
Uh, he only has me
clean his quarters.

06:52.237 --> 06:53.674
I'm not to touch the
rest of the house.

06:53.717 --> 06:54.892
What sort of a man is he?

06:54.936 --> 06:57.373
Oh, like any other man,
I suppose.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.201
Well, does he have a job,
friends, family?

06:59.244 --> 07:01.856
I do Mondays and Thursdays.

07:01.899 --> 07:02.857
Have you any idea
where he's gone?

07:04.511 --> 07:06.469
What did he do?

07:06.513 --> 07:08.950
Did he ever talk
of an Alfred Pennyworth?

07:08.993 --> 07:11.474
Like I said, we
don't speak much.

07:11.518 --> 07:12.693
He's up at the crack,

07:12.736 --> 07:14.129
puts on his uniform,
and off he goes.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.347
Uniform?

07:15.391 --> 07:17.262
He's still
commissioned?

07:17.306 --> 07:19.090
Not according
to the Records Office, he's not.

07:19.134 --> 07:24.835
So where the fuck is he going
all dolled up?

07:28.578 --> 07:31.407
SYKES:
Please let me come.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.626
You know it's not down to me.

07:32.669 --> 07:33.757
I wouldn't leave you
on your own.

07:33.801 --> 07:36.064
It's Lord Snooty's decree.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.022
Be fair, Peg. You
know it makes sense.

07:38.066 --> 07:39.807
She's a liability.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.635
A liability?

07:41.678 --> 07:43.201
All I
mean to say is

07:43.245 --> 07:45.639
that someone might
recognize you, my dove,

07:45.682 --> 07:48.293
that's all.I know what
liability means.

07:48.337 --> 07:51.427
Off you go.
Don't mind me.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.994
We won't be long, will we?

07:53.037 --> 07:56.214
No. Sorry, Bet.

07:56.258 --> 07:58.521
Come now.
Wish us luck.

08:01.611 --> 08:02.743
Luck.

08:53.315 --> 08:54.359
Good morning.

08:57.449 --> 08:59.408
We're here to see Dr. Gaunt.

08:59.451 --> 09:02.846
Surgery hours are
between 12:00 and 6:00.

09:02.890 --> 09:06.023
Nobody's poorly, love.
It's a social call.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.068
There's nobody listed.

09:07.111 --> 09:09.984
It's a surprise visit.

09:10.027 --> 09:11.986
If you're not
on the list...

09:12.029 --> 09:13.944
you're not on the list.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.511
She'll want to see us.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.622
Good morning, madam.
How can I help?

09:39.666 --> 09:40.884
If you've come
to sell something,

09:40.928 --> 09:42.973
the answer is:
no, thank you, good day.

09:43.017 --> 09:44.975
PEGGY:
Alone, are we?

09:45.019 --> 09:47.499
Now that's
an impertinent question.

09:47.543 --> 09:48.849
Why do you ask?

09:48.892 --> 09:51.460
We've a situation
wanting discretion.

09:51.503 --> 09:54.115
Loose lips sink
ships and all that.

09:54.158 --> 09:55.507
I'm listening.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.205
So you're alone, then?Yes, I am.

09:57.248 --> 09:58.728
Explain yourself, madam.

10:07.128 --> 10:09.260
My God, James!

10:09.304 --> 10:11.219
Hello, Frances.

10:11.262 --> 10:14.004
I thought you were dead!
We all thought you were dead.

10:14.048 --> 10:18.356
Well, I rather thought so, too,
but, um... well, here I am.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.575
Oh...

10:20.707 --> 10:23.144
Oh.

10:32.153 --> 10:34.634
MARTHA:
This is the place.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.200
THOMAS:
You sure?

10:36.244 --> 10:37.898
I mean, it looks
different in daylight,

10:37.941 --> 10:41.336
but... yeah, I'm pretty sure.

10:41.379 --> 10:43.077
This is the place, I think.You think?

10:43.120 --> 10:44.513
Would you please stop
repeating everything

10:44.556 --> 10:46.167
I say in a loud voice?

10:46.210 --> 10:49.561
I can't believe I trusted you.
What a mess.

10:49.605 --> 10:51.259
It's all I need
right now.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.435
Then go. I can handle this.

10:53.478 --> 10:54.436
Three days, Martha.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.960
A three-day blackout?

10:57.004 --> 10:59.528
Forgive me if I doubt
your ability to handle this.

10:59.571 --> 11:01.399
I can and I will.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.619
You have no conception of
the trouble you've caused.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.794
Every time Patricia
pulls this sort of crap,

11:04.838 --> 11:06.361
it ends up in
the papers,

11:06.404 --> 11:07.710
and the Wayne family name
gets dragged through the mud.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.104
You self-important boob.

11:10.147 --> 11:13.107
I woke up naked
on Hampstead Heath.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.586
I have no idea
what happened to me.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.632
Your sister
is missing and...

11:16.676 --> 11:18.025
you're worried
about your name?

11:21.985 --> 11:25.380
Oh... hello.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.345
Welcome back, Martha.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.392
Who's your friend?

11:37.435 --> 11:40.787
Pardon the intrusion.

11:40.830 --> 11:44.442
This young lady says
that my sister might be here.

11:44.486 --> 11:45.792
Patricia Wayne.

11:45.835 --> 11:47.532
We've always got so many guests.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.103
Where's Crowley?

11:53.147 --> 11:54.757
I want to speak to him.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.759
Immediately.

11:56.803 --> 11:59.893
Have a drink.
Wet your whistle.

11:59.936 --> 12:02.156
I'm sure we have
anything you'd like.

12:02.199 --> 12:03.766
No, thank you.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.202
As I was saying,
my sister?

12:05.246 --> 12:06.682
Where's Crowley?

12:06.726 --> 12:09.554
Hold your horses, Martha.
He'll be along.

12:09.598 --> 12:12.035
Call me Miss Kane,
whoever the hell you are.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.558
Whoare you?

12:13.602 --> 12:16.910
Oh. I'm sorry,

12:16.953 --> 12:20.000
I... I thought
you'd remember me.

12:21.175 --> 12:22.437
Such fun we had.

12:25.919 --> 12:28.617
If I don't see Crowley
and Patricia Wayne down here

12:28.660 --> 12:30.880
right this minute,
I'm calling the police.

12:30.924 --> 12:33.578
Oh, no, no, no.
No, don't do that.

12:33.622 --> 12:36.364
No police.No.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.670
We don't want
the police here, either.

12:38.714 --> 12:39.759
We just want my sister.

12:41.543 --> 12:42.674
Miss Kane.

12:42.718 --> 12:45.634
How lovely to
see you again.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.027
And in such

12:47.070 --> 12:48.506
illustrious company.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.901
The famous
Thomas Wayne.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.729
Your sister speaks
very highly of you.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.557
I doubt that.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.515
Crowley, is it?

12:58.690 --> 13:00.692
Where is my sister?I'm so sorry

13:00.736 --> 13:01.737
you've been
worried about her.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.217
Patricia's fine.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.654
She's upstairs.
Safe and sound.

13:05.697 --> 13:10.920
Well... good.
Bring her here, please.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.356
Of course.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.272
My angel, fetch
Patricia, would you?

13:17.927 --> 13:20.190
Thank you.

13:20.234 --> 13:23.846
If she is indeed okay,
you have my apologies

13:23.890 --> 13:24.934
for coming in

13:24.978 --> 13:26.457
hot, so to speak.Apology, my ass.

13:26.501 --> 13:29.243
I'm missing three days
of my life

13:29.286 --> 13:31.549
thanks to whatever it is
you slipped into my drink.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.595
Three days?

13:33.638 --> 13:35.597
Dear me.

13:35.640 --> 13:39.340
Mmm. I can assure you, Martha,

13:39.383 --> 13:41.168
I slipped nothing
into your drink.

13:41.211 --> 13:43.170
Perhaps the police
can find out.

13:43.213 --> 13:46.303
Martha, I'm sorry
you didn't have a good time.

13:46.347 --> 13:48.305
I haven't the foggiest notion
what happened to you.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.220
I'm afraid I wasn't
paying attention.

13:50.264 --> 13:51.918
It was a good party.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.267
And I rather took you
for an adult.

13:53.310 --> 13:57.314
As for the police,
call them, by all means.

13:57.358 --> 13:59.012
The chief inspector
is a dear friend.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.970
He'll tell you I'm a good egg.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.711
A good egg?

14:02.754 --> 14:03.930
Martha.

14:03.973 --> 14:06.497
Let's not make
a federal case of this.

14:06.541 --> 14:09.413
If Patricia is okay, there's
no need to involve the police.

14:09.457 --> 14:12.068
I'll be the judge of that.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.114
Where's the crime here?

14:14.157 --> 14:16.551
Sin we have in joyful abundance,

14:16.594 --> 14:18.205
but crime... no.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.085
There was a man
with a goat's head.

14:31.783 --> 14:33.350
There was blood.
I remember that much.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.222
Dear me.

14:35.265 --> 14:36.484
You did have a wild old time.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.442
A goat's head forsooth.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.662
Martha, I...Don't "Martha" me.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.797
Tommy.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.974
Oh, my goodness.
Patricia.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.759
Are you,
are you okay?

14:50.802 --> 14:52.413
You are so cute.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.023
You mean, was I ravished

14:54.067 --> 14:56.112
by the devil?
Violated

14:56.156 --> 14:58.071
by Beelzebub?

14:58.114 --> 15:00.900
Okay. Get your things.
We're leaving.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.946
Leaving? Oh, no,
I'm not leaving.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.382
I'm finally home.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.732
Don't be ridiculous.
This isn't your home.

15:07.776 --> 15:10.474
And this man--
I don't know who this man is

15:10.518 --> 15:13.260
but he's not respectable
and you're not staying here.

15:13.303 --> 15:15.262
Mr. Wayne.

15:15.305 --> 15:17.046
Patricia is an adult.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.787
If she wishes to stay,

15:18.830 --> 15:20.267
what kind of host
would I be

15:20.310 --> 15:22.356
to let her be taken
against her will?

15:22.399 --> 15:25.794
Patricia...
I would like to speak

15:25.837 --> 15:27.752
with you... alone.Don't want to.

15:27.796 --> 15:29.841
CROWLEY:
Go along and be nice,

15:29.885 --> 15:31.408
Patricia.

15:31.452 --> 15:32.757
Talk to him.

15:32.801 --> 15:35.325
He's family.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.903
Do you have...

15:47.947 --> 15:50.166
Mrs. Bung,
the brewer's wife?

16:00.046 --> 16:02.178
GAUNT:
We were rather lost

16:02.222 --> 16:03.701
without your
leadership.

16:03.745 --> 16:06.530
You are a
species of a miracle.

16:06.574 --> 16:08.924
I am, aren't I?

16:08.968 --> 16:12.623
A battered...
somewhat grotesque miracle.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.364
My gosh.

16:14.408 --> 16:17.019
What horrors you have suffered.
We must

16:17.063 --> 16:19.021
get you out
of the country

16:19.065 --> 16:20.980
and beyond our
enemies' reach.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.242
The Germans...

16:22.285 --> 16:24.244
would be glad to offer refuge.

16:24.287 --> 16:27.029
Oh, heavens no.
I can't leave England.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.118
The crisis is coming.

16:29.162 --> 16:30.728
The game's afoot.

16:30.772 --> 16:33.775
Well, I... defer
to your judgment of course,

16:33.818 --> 16:37.561
but... I-I rather think
the peace that we've...

16:37.605 --> 16:40.129
cobbled together--
will hold.

16:40.173 --> 16:42.088
I hope so.

16:42.131 --> 16:43.611
Peace...

16:43.654 --> 16:46.179
above all things.Absolutely.

16:46.222 --> 16:48.181
But Undine Thwaite is no fool.

16:48.224 --> 16:50.357
She'll break the truce...

16:50.400 --> 16:51.836
as soon as
she's consolidated power.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.317
You think so?

16:54.361 --> 16:58.147
Mrs. Thwaite seems sincere

16:58.191 --> 17:00.236
in her desire for peace.You had

17:00.280 --> 17:02.151
her husband killed
in front of her.

17:02.195 --> 17:03.674
Bold and ruthless move,

17:03.718 --> 17:05.937
by the way.
Brava.

17:05.981 --> 17:07.722
But...

17:07.765 --> 17:09.898
I expect she'd be
rather vengeful.

17:09.941 --> 17:11.117
Whatever she may say.

17:11.160 --> 17:14.076
I did not kill Julian Thwaite.

17:15.730 --> 17:18.428
Everyone, ev-everyone thinks
I did, but I didn't.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.343
Interesting.

17:23.216 --> 17:25.392
This murderous sort
of political intrigue

17:25.435 --> 17:27.394
is beyond my ken.

17:27.437 --> 17:29.396
Now, tell me your
plans, I am at

17:29.439 --> 17:30.658
your disposal.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.877
My plan is simple.

17:32.921 --> 17:34.749
Redemption.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.490
A glorious triumph.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.448
A national awakening.

17:40.015 --> 17:41.712
I will destroy my enemies

17:41.756 --> 17:44.106
and lead this country
back to greatness.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.326
Okay.

17:46.369 --> 17:48.328
Touch ambitious, maybe.

17:48.371 --> 17:50.025
How are you going
to do that, exactly?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.940
I mean, if you
reveal yourself,

17:51.983 --> 17:53.333
the government
will arrest you

17:53.376 --> 17:55.335
and they will not
make the mistake

17:55.378 --> 17:57.293
of letting you live this time.Yes.

17:59.165 --> 18:00.688
For now...

18:00.731 --> 18:02.124
I shall remain in hiding.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.909
We will let the Raven Society

18:04.953 --> 18:06.955
grand council know
that I'm alive and well,

18:06.998 --> 18:08.261
but no one else must know.

18:08.304 --> 18:10.350
And then...

18:10.393 --> 18:11.655
when the time is right,

18:11.699 --> 18:13.918
I shall reveal myself publicly.

18:13.962 --> 18:15.442
To maximum effect.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.531
I see.

18:23.363 --> 18:24.929
You seem doubtful.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.583
No, no, no, no, no.

18:26.627 --> 18:28.846
Sounds like a plan.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.544
THOMAS:
What is going on here, Patricia?

18:30.587 --> 18:32.937
I'm happier
than I've ever been, Tommy.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.548
Look at me.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.680
Well...

18:36.724 --> 18:39.118
I have to admit,
you do look good.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.597
I feel like
a new woman.

18:40.641 --> 18:43.034
Probably some kind
of drug, I imagine.

18:43.078 --> 18:45.167
No drugs.
Well, some.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.343
But they're incidental.

18:47.387 --> 18:49.171
Love.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.391
That's the thing,
that's what I've found here.

18:51.434 --> 18:54.263
Love...
and honesty.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.352
Oh, please.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.876
You should hear yourself.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.270
How can you be so gullible?

19:01.314 --> 19:04.404
Can't you see
that he's a bad hat?

19:04.447 --> 19:08.190
This whole place
reeks of... darkness.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.757
Exactly.

19:11.411 --> 19:15.023
There is no light
without darkness.

19:15.066 --> 19:18.113
All we are is darkness.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.159
We are simply
shadows

19:20.202 --> 19:22.944
cast by the
divine flame.Oh, mendacious drivel.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.380
You are Patricia Wayne.

19:24.424 --> 19:25.990
And you have a family
who loves you

19:26.034 --> 19:27.731
and you have responsibilities
that you must honor.

19:29.864 --> 19:33.084
Last time you saw me,
you asked why I was so unhappy

19:33.128 --> 19:35.391
and I got upset
because I didn't know.

19:35.435 --> 19:39.569
I was dead inside
and I didn't know why.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.092
Now I know.

19:41.136 --> 19:43.182
I can see.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.966
For the first
time in my life,

19:45.009 --> 19:48.056
I'm alive and Aleister
showed me the way.

19:48.099 --> 19:49.449
He is a...

19:49.492 --> 19:51.102
he is a jumped-up pimp,
Patricia.

19:51.146 --> 19:53.061
Satanism?

19:53.104 --> 19:54.932
Devil worship?

19:54.976 --> 19:56.412
Oh, come on, it's bullshit.

19:56.456 --> 19:57.848
You're embarrassing yourself
and the family.

19:57.892 --> 20:01.243
Hmm.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.854
Now we're
getting to it.

20:06.074 --> 20:08.468
You don't give
a fuck about me.

20:08.511 --> 20:10.644
You're just worried
about the family name.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.167
So what if I am?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.864
It is a name worth protecting.You mean

20:13.908 --> 20:15.910
it's a share price
worth protecting.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.390
Yes, it's a goddamn share price
worth protecting.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.566
Yes, it is.

20:19.609 --> 20:22.482
Tommy, you're my brother
and I love you,

20:22.525 --> 20:25.311
so I'm gonna tell you the truth.

20:25.354 --> 20:27.965
You're a callous,
coldhearted,

20:28.009 --> 20:31.099
small-minded, priggish,
moneygrubbing, loveless,

20:31.142 --> 20:32.361
fucked-in-the-head loser.

20:37.453 --> 20:41.152
Well...

20:41.196 --> 20:43.242
I am sorry you feel that way.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.069
For the first
time in my life,

20:45.113 --> 20:47.158
I'm happy, I'm fucking happy.

20:47.202 --> 20:50.858
Why do you care why?
Why can't you just be glad

20:50.901 --> 20:52.338
that I am happy?

20:52.381 --> 20:54.383
If you are happy...

20:54.427 --> 20:56.864
then I'm glad for you,
of course I am.

20:56.907 --> 20:58.909
If I could believe you.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.698

All right.

23:35.762 --> 23:37.677
And a clean cloth.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.156
Lint-free, mind.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.203
It's a nice one you've chosen.

23:45.206 --> 23:46.686
Great color.

23:50.298 --> 23:52.387
She'd have made
a wonderful daughter-in-law.

24:03.224 --> 24:06.096
I'll take my tea
in the living room, love.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.446
When you're done
picking the leaves.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.448
Right you are,
Your Majesty.

24:34.734 --> 24:37.911
The intensity
of your contempt

24:37.954 --> 24:40.304
is impressive, Martha,
but quite unwarranted.

24:40.348 --> 24:43.090
Whatever happened

24:43.133 --> 24:45.092
to you happened because...

24:45.135 --> 24:47.877
you wanted it to happen.

24:47.921 --> 24:50.750
The only compulsion
in our religion... is desire.

24:50.793 --> 24:53.056
You can spout
all the cod theology you like.

24:53.100 --> 24:55.755
You're nothing but
a pathetic little con man.

24:57.234 --> 24:58.758
Sticks and stones, Martha.

24:58.801 --> 25:02.588
I've been vilified
by popes and kings.

25:02.631 --> 25:05.025
But here I am still.

25:07.157 --> 25:08.681
Unscathed.

25:08.724 --> 25:10.944
Well, Thomas Wayne is no pope.

25:10.987 --> 25:13.424
The Wayne family
are billionaires.

25:13.468 --> 25:16.906
Do you think they
got that way by sermonizing?

25:16.950 --> 25:19.213
They've crushed nations.

25:19.256 --> 25:21.650
What are you to them?

25:21.694 --> 25:23.565
A flea.

25:23.609 --> 25:26.133
The deadliest of creatures.

25:26.176 --> 25:28.788
Keep talking. You'll see.

25:39.929 --> 25:41.365
Mr. Crowley,

25:41.409 --> 25:43.803
I'm warning you.

25:43.846 --> 25:45.805
If any harm should come
to my sister, you'll pay dearly.

25:45.848 --> 25:48.285
Dearly.

25:48.329 --> 25:50.505
Let's go.Go?

25:52.072 --> 25:53.595
You're leaving her here?

25:53.639 --> 25:55.205
She's an adult.

25:55.249 --> 25:57.251
She must do
as she likes.

26:00.776 --> 26:03.692
You can't just
leave her here.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.781
This man...I know what he is,
goddamn it.

26:05.825 --> 26:06.782
CROWLEY:
But please...

26:06.826 --> 26:09.176
you mustn't leave so soon,

26:09.219 --> 26:11.657
and in such a bad temper.
You can at least

26:11.700 --> 26:13.136
stay for something to eat.

26:13.180 --> 26:17.619
We have so much
to talk about.Good day to you, sir.

26:17.663 --> 26:22.624
Patricia... if you
change your mind, call me.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.626
Thank you, Tommy.

26:43.079 --> 26:44.994
You can't leave
your sister there.I just did.

26:45.038 --> 26:47.388
She's in danger.She's been in danger
her whole life.

26:47.431 --> 26:49.042
That's where she wants to be.

26:49.085 --> 26:51.131
Crowley will tire of Patricia,
or Patricia will tire of him,

26:51.174 --> 26:53.133
and he'll call me and ask for
money, and I'll pay him off.

26:53.176 --> 26:54.569
That's how
these things work, okay?

26:54.613 --> 26:56.005
How can you
be so cold?

26:56.049 --> 26:58.529
Practice and discipline.Jesus, you're
an asshole!

27:00.793 --> 27:02.011
Before you worry
about my sister,

27:02.055 --> 27:03.752
take a look
at yourself.

27:03.796 --> 27:05.667
I thought you were
a sensible woman.

27:05.711 --> 27:06.886
But you obviously have some

27:06.929 --> 27:08.278
serious personal issues
to confront.

27:14.023 --> 27:16.373
Mayfair, please.DRIVER: Right away, sir.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.859
Fuck!

27:34.130 --> 27:35.392
Morning, soldier.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.438
Where do you think
you're going?Quick half.

27:37.481 --> 27:39.396
Take the edge off.Officers only.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.311
I aman officer.

27:41.355 --> 27:42.965
And I'm Queen Victoria.

27:43.009 --> 27:44.750
Well, keep smiling,
Your Majesty.

27:44.793 --> 27:46.316
Fuck off.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.884
Fair play.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.687
If I could have your attention,
please, gentlemen.

28:11.559 --> 28:14.562
Private Alfred Pennyworth.
Special Air Service.

28:14.605 --> 28:16.869
Now, excuse me
for disrupting you,

28:16.912 --> 28:18.566
but I'm looking
for one of your officers

28:18.609 --> 28:20.568
and hoping you might
be able to help me.

28:20.611 --> 28:23.310
Captain John Fitz-Smytth Curzon,

28:23.353 --> 28:25.616
Third Battalion, retired.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.751
Captain Curzon,
someone must know where he is.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.973
I'm all for loyalty
to old comrades

28:34.016 --> 28:35.539
and all that, all right,

28:35.583 --> 28:37.759
but this bloke has dishonored
your regiment, all right?

28:37.803 --> 28:39.979
You owe him nothing.
Fuck off...Come along, boyo.

28:40.022 --> 28:42.633
Oh, you're in for a kicking.Fuck off.

28:42.677 --> 28:44.679
MALCOLM:
Belay that, Sergeant.

28:46.812 --> 28:47.813
Let him have his say.

28:49.945 --> 28:51.642
Carry on,
young man.

28:51.686 --> 28:54.602
Thank you, sir.

28:54.645 --> 28:55.951
I'll try to be brief.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.479
Now, your man Curzon
killed my fiancée.

29:04.917 --> 29:09.008
Her name was Esme Winikus.

29:09.051 --> 29:12.707
23. Never hurt a fly.

29:15.188 --> 29:17.016
Now he done her
to get back at me

29:17.059 --> 29:19.279
for making a joke
at his expense.

29:19.322 --> 29:24.153
His men laughed at him
and he never forgave me.

29:24.197 --> 29:26.982
So he beat her

29:27.026 --> 29:29.680
and strangled her to death.

29:31.291 --> 29:33.293
This man's put a black mark

29:33.336 --> 29:34.816
against the good name
of your regiment.

29:34.860 --> 29:38.167
Now I'm asking you,

29:38.211 --> 29:39.603
as honorable men,

29:39.647 --> 29:40.996
please help me.

29:43.390 --> 29:46.349
Captain John Fitz-Smytth Curzon.
Third Battalion.

29:48.699 --> 29:52.529
I'm asking for your help
as human fucking beings.

29:52.573 --> 29:54.140
Now if you can't do
what's right,

29:54.183 --> 29:56.664
then I won't answer for what
happens when I find the bastard.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.059
You're a loon,
you are.

30:00.102 --> 30:02.104
Yeah, and you're
a fucking slave, mate.

30:02.148 --> 30:03.845
A slave to a mob
of chinless wankers.

30:03.889 --> 30:05.542
Walk away, son, just walk away.

30:05.586 --> 30:08.241
Or what? Why don't you take
a swing, see what you get?

30:08.284 --> 30:10.243
I said walk away.Come ahead, try me.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.375
I warned you.MALCOLM:
Steady on, Sergeant.

30:12.419 --> 30:14.247
That'll do.

30:14.290 --> 30:16.858
I'll deal with him.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.338
Yes, sir.

30:18.381 --> 30:20.296
A slave to wankers!

30:25.824 --> 30:27.869
You SAS chaps,
you're an odd bunch.

30:27.913 --> 30:31.351
Cool as cucumbers
and mad as hatters.

30:31.394 --> 30:35.181
No fear and no discipline.
More like bandits

30:35.224 --> 30:38.271
than decent soldiers.Do you know where Curzon is?

30:41.927 --> 30:46.105
On the face of it,
your story sounds absurd.

30:46.148 --> 30:47.454
Why would I lie?

30:47.497 --> 30:51.762
Oh. I can think of
a hundred reasons,

30:51.806 --> 30:53.503
but you look like
an honest man.

30:53.547 --> 30:56.376
I like to think I'm a good
judge of such things.

30:56.419 --> 30:59.074
On my life, it's the truth.

30:59.118 --> 31:03.339
You're asking rather a lot.

31:03.383 --> 31:06.038
You're asking the regiment
to betray one of its own.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.605
A lunatic, a murderer.

31:08.649 --> 31:10.999
Army's full of them.

31:11.043 --> 31:13.915
You can't win wars without
lunatics and murderers.

31:13.959 --> 31:17.179
I just want this one.

31:21.705 --> 31:23.011
Well, I'll make inquiries.

31:25.013 --> 31:27.755
Rutlands look after their own,
but we don't harbor cads.

31:32.803 --> 31:34.153
Where can I reach you?

31:34.196 --> 31:36.982
Severed Arms public house.
Bethnal Green.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.114
Well, no promises,

31:39.158 --> 31:41.160
but if your story
passes muster,

31:41.203 --> 31:43.466
I'll have a man there
tomorrow at 1400 hours.

31:43.510 --> 31:47.035
Thank you, sir.

32:18.849 --> 32:20.155
Okay.

32:24.203 --> 32:27.641
Oh. What do you want?

32:27.684 --> 32:31.514
You need to go get your sister
away from that man.

32:31.558 --> 32:35.388
He's not a pimp, he's
in league with the devil.

32:35.431 --> 32:36.650
I mean, really, he is.

32:36.693 --> 32:38.608
It's not an act. It's true.

32:38.652 --> 32:41.742
The devil.

32:41.785 --> 32:45.398
Okay, now you're scaring me.
Do you know how crazy you sound?

32:45.441 --> 32:48.227
I'm telling you the truth. I...

32:52.144 --> 32:53.884
I started remembering
what happened to me.

32:53.928 --> 32:56.975
And?

33:01.109 --> 33:02.458
And it's horrible.

33:06.680 --> 33:10.684
It's unspeakable. I can't...

33:10.727 --> 33:14.122
I can't begin to describe the...

33:14.166 --> 33:15.341
the vileness.

33:15.384 --> 33:19.084
Were you...

33:19.127 --> 33:20.694
sexually assaulted?

33:22.826 --> 33:26.047
No, it's not that.

33:26.091 --> 33:27.483
It's worse.

33:27.527 --> 33:30.008
Worse how?I don't know.

33:30.051 --> 33:33.272
I just... I don't know,
I just, I...

33:33.315 --> 33:36.449
I-I-I feel it.
Something evil happened.

33:38.581 --> 33:42.150
Okay. Let's be frank.

33:42.194 --> 33:44.196
You had a bad experience
at a sordid party,

33:44.239 --> 33:45.414
followed by some bad dreams.

33:45.458 --> 33:48.026
That's all.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.854
It's perfectly natural
to feel upset.

33:50.898 --> 33:54.032
The devil doesn't exist.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.903
And if he does exist,
he's not in Chelsea

33:55.946 --> 33:57.122
throwing some beatnik orgies.

33:57.165 --> 33:58.906
I'm sure he has something
better to do.

33:58.949 --> 34:00.386
I saw him.

34:00.429 --> 34:02.953
No, Martha, you didn't.
And if you continue to believe

34:02.997 --> 34:04.825
that you did, you should
seek psychiatric help.

34:04.868 --> 34:07.088
Your sister
is in terrible danger.

34:07.132 --> 34:10.483
You saw her for yourself.
She's never been happier.

34:10.526 --> 34:14.095
Exactly, and how much sense
does that make?

34:14.139 --> 34:15.749
If you don't help her,
then I will.

34:15.792 --> 34:18.534
How?Well, I'd contact
the police,

34:18.578 --> 34:20.232
but they'll say
the same as you.Exactly.

34:20.275 --> 34:22.190
So I'll have to
take care of it myself.

34:22.234 --> 34:26.064
If you don't hear from me, you
might contact the authorities

34:26.107 --> 34:29.937
and ask them to investigate,
if it's not too much trouble.

34:29.980 --> 34:31.199
Martha, really?

34:37.031 --> 34:39.120
For God's sake.

34:39.164 --> 34:40.643
Wait!

34:40.687 --> 34:42.602
Martha.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.749
You're back.

34:59.793 --> 35:01.708
Wonderful.

35:01.751 --> 35:03.710
And right on time, I'm so glad.

35:03.753 --> 35:06.104
All right, Crowley,

35:06.147 --> 35:07.583
let's not waste our breath
on formalities.

35:07.627 --> 35:11.152
How much?Do sit down.

35:11.196 --> 35:13.154
My angel, fetch Patricia,

35:13.198 --> 35:14.764
would you?

35:14.808 --> 35:16.331
At once, sir.

35:19.247 --> 35:20.640
Such a lovely boy.

35:20.683 --> 35:23.077
Red or white?

35:23.121 --> 35:24.861
Neither. I asked you

35:24.905 --> 35:27.168
how much.How much for what?

35:27.212 --> 35:28.648
You know
damn well what.

35:28.691 --> 35:31.085
Martha, patience.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.695
As we agreed?

35:34.828 --> 35:36.960
I've spent years
extricating my sister

35:37.004 --> 35:40.225
from the clutches of various
pimps and perverts.

35:40.268 --> 35:41.661
They always have a price.

35:41.704 --> 35:44.838
I'm not a pimp.
I don't want your money.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.883
I have more than
I know what to do with.

35:46.927 --> 35:49.103
So what do you want?

35:49.147 --> 35:50.844
I'm very fond
of your sister.

35:50.887 --> 35:53.368
I'd hate to lose her,
even if she wanted to leave,

35:53.412 --> 35:55.153
which she doesn't.I'm waiting.

35:55.196 --> 35:58.243
Martha knows what I want.
Don't you, darling?

35:58.286 --> 36:00.767
A good beating.Such spirit.

36:00.810 --> 36:02.682
What do you want,
Crowley?

36:02.725 --> 36:05.424
I want your soul, of course.

36:05.467 --> 36:07.426
That is, my master wants it.

36:07.469 --> 36:12.082
Is that all?

36:12.126 --> 36:15.434
Fine. Consider it yours.
Give me my sister.

36:15.477 --> 36:17.566
You're a businessman,
Mr. Wayne.

36:17.610 --> 36:19.786
You know that saying something
doesn't make it so.

36:19.829 --> 36:21.004
I'll need
a contract,

36:21.048 --> 36:22.789
inked in your blood,
of course.

36:22.832 --> 36:25.574
Oh, please, spare me this bilge.
I don't believe in Satan.

36:25.618 --> 36:27.141
Oh, you're modern,

36:27.185 --> 36:28.447
rational, well-educated,

36:28.490 --> 36:30.362
a civilized man
of peace and moderation.

36:30.405 --> 36:34.104
Of course you don't believe in
Satan, but that doesn't matter.

36:34.148 --> 36:36.150
Satan believes in you.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.457
He knows there's a beast
inside of you.

36:38.500 --> 36:41.764
There is no beast inside of me,
just profound irritation.

36:41.808 --> 36:43.897
Oh, ye of little faith.

36:46.726 --> 36:50.251
Cute. Wayne Enterprises
has doors

36:50.295 --> 36:51.992
just like that
in our Gotham lobby.

36:52.035 --> 36:53.211
Ah, yes.

36:53.254 --> 36:55.430
Wayne Enterprises.

36:55.474 --> 36:59.086
How marvelous to be
a billionaire. Such freedom.

37:00.827 --> 37:03.743
Ah. I see.

37:03.786 --> 37:05.353
When you say
you want my soul,

37:05.397 --> 37:08.095
you mean the company
and its assets.

37:08.138 --> 37:10.576
Dream on, buster.Heartbreaking.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.186
You've spent your
whole life never knowing

37:12.230 --> 37:15.233
if someone's interested in you
or just your name.

37:16.930 --> 37:19.280
Believe me when I say:

37:19.324 --> 37:21.761
it's you he wants.

37:21.804 --> 37:25.243
Your spiritual essence,
not your company.

37:25.286 --> 37:27.854
Wow. You're a good con man.

37:27.897 --> 37:30.726
I can see how you
brainwashed my sister.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.989
You'd need more than
parlor tricks to convince me.

37:33.033 --> 37:35.340
Your brother thinks
I've brainwashed you.

37:35.383 --> 37:38.299
That's ridiculous.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.736
Aleister is just a very
wise and loving man.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.608
A teacher.

37:42.651 --> 37:44.305
Patricia, he's a servant
of the fucking devil.

37:44.349 --> 37:47.047
Martha, I'm trying to make
a deal with this person

37:47.090 --> 37:49.876
and you're making
everything much harder.

37:49.919 --> 37:52.531
Tell me.

37:52.574 --> 37:54.837
How did you two

37:54.881 --> 37:57.449
end up working together?

37:57.492 --> 38:00.060
What was the league thinking?

38:00.103 --> 38:01.844
What league?

38:01.888 --> 38:05.674
Oh, come. I'm not a fool.
The No-Name League.

38:05.718 --> 38:07.894
We're not working
for the No-Name League.

38:07.937 --> 38:09.504
CROWLEY:
Really?

38:09.548 --> 38:12.725
Next, you'll tell me you're
not spying on them for the CIA.

38:12.768 --> 38:16.642
That's a strange idea.

38:16.685 --> 38:18.078
Not true.

38:18.121 --> 38:20.863
You're CIA?
I'm not.

38:22.996 --> 38:24.737
Holy shit.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.569
Of course. I should've guessed.

38:30.612 --> 38:33.485
The CIA? Like...

38:33.528 --> 38:35.008
The CIA?

38:35.051 --> 38:39.665
I am not. Where'd you
get such a notion?

38:39.708 --> 38:42.015
My boss. Where else?THOMAS: Okay, listen,

38:42.058 --> 38:44.322
it is extremely dangerous
to spread that kind of a lie.

38:44.365 --> 38:47.586
Oh. See his teeth?

38:47.629 --> 38:50.893
Yes, deceptively sharp.

38:50.937 --> 38:52.286
There's a beast
inside this one.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.679
PATRICIA:
I am so impressed,

38:53.722 --> 38:56.812
Tommy. For real, the CIA.
Have you killed people?

38:56.856 --> 38:58.597
I repeat, no.

38:58.640 --> 39:02.514
Son of a bitch. CIA? Wow.

39:02.557 --> 39:07.301
Never mind the CIA,
which I'm not a member of.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.172
Let me get
this straight.

39:09.216 --> 39:11.610
In exchange for my sister's
liberty, I have to sell...

39:11.653 --> 39:13.438
I have to sell

39:13.481 --> 39:15.483
my soul to the devil.

39:15.527 --> 39:18.051
Precisely. What do you say?

39:18.094 --> 39:20.270
I'll give you 50,000
to hand her over.

39:20.314 --> 39:22.142
I'm not a goddamn package.

39:22.185 --> 39:23.273
I don't want your money.

39:23.317 --> 39:24.753
If the devil is real,

39:24.797 --> 39:27.277
don't you think my actual soul
is a bit of a high price

39:27.321 --> 39:29.715
to stop you debauching my
sister. She's not Snow White.

39:29.758 --> 39:32.457
200,000 pounds.Fuck you.

39:32.500 --> 39:36.156
You get much more
than Patricia in return.

39:36.199 --> 39:38.724
You get my master's
eternal friendship.

39:38.767 --> 39:41.117
You're a smart
businessman,

39:41.161 --> 39:42.554
Mr. Wayne, think of that.

39:42.597 --> 39:44.817
Think of the power you'll have.

39:44.860 --> 39:46.384
I have power now, you fool.

39:46.427 --> 39:48.255
I can buy and sell
the likes of you.

39:48.298 --> 39:49.996
See now, there's
the beast inside of you.

39:50.039 --> 39:52.694
The real Thomas Wayne
is emerging.

39:52.738 --> 39:55.654
Okay.

39:55.697 --> 39:58.657
Fine. I'll play along

39:58.700 --> 40:01.790
with your ludicrous charade.
You're Lucifer's servant.

40:01.834 --> 40:03.705
I don't negotiate

40:03.749 --> 40:06.578
with underlings.
Let me speak with your boss.

40:06.621 --> 40:09.319
Well, as a rule, he doesn't
grant personal audiences,

40:09.363 --> 40:12.410
except for saints
and the like,

40:12.453 --> 40:14.673
but there's no harm
in asking.
Mm.

40:29.296 --> 40:33.387
So, you want to meet the devil?

40:33.431 --> 40:36.216
No, I don't.

40:36.259 --> 40:39.698
And I'm confident I won't.

40:39.741 --> 40:42.614
But supposing you do?

40:42.657 --> 40:46.313
Suppose you meet him. Will you
listen to what he has to say?

40:46.356 --> 40:48.228
Can we get on with this, please?

40:48.271 --> 40:51.361
I'm curious to see what
hocus pocus you've cooked up.

40:53.233 --> 40:54.669
Good enough.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.895
Ooh.

41:19.389 --> 41:20.478
Okay.

41:27.615 --> 41:29.530
All right.

41:36.537 --> 41:37.843
Hmm.

41:47.026 --> 41:48.244
Really?

41:48.288 --> 41:50.159
Blue movies?

41:58.559 --> 42:00.169
Oh...

42:31.505 --> 42:32.898
JASON:
Fucking lunatic, that one.

42:32.941 --> 42:34.682
Got the devil in her.

42:34.726 --> 42:36.945
So to speak.

42:46.738 --> 42:49.828
Your family must have been
a right old mess

42:49.871 --> 42:51.438
to turn a woman that way.

42:53.658 --> 42:55.529
Did you ever have a go?

42:55.573 --> 42:57.183
If you haven't,

42:57.226 --> 42:59.794
you should.Turn it off.

42:59.838 --> 43:01.579
Turn it off!

43:01.622 --> 43:03.363
I said turn it off!

43:06.496 --> 43:07.933
You missed the best part.

44:18.830 --> 44:21.484
And you say there's
no beast in you.

44:29.188 --> 44:31.451
Christ...

44:35.368 --> 44:38.110
Now, be honest, Thomas.

44:38.153 --> 44:41.679
Tell me you didn't
meet the devil.

44:44.638 --> 44:48.033
PATRICIA:
Christ, Tommy, what...

44:48.076 --> 44:49.687
Let's go.No. Aleister! Help!

44:49.730 --> 44:52.733
Please be at
peace, Patricia.

44:54.343 --> 44:57.869
Your brother and I
understand each other now.

44:57.912 --> 45:01.960
You must do what he
wants. I command it.

45:02.003 --> 45:04.223
Patricia!

45:04.266 --> 45:06.051
No...

45:13.449 --> 45:15.103
Goodbye, all.

45:16.670 --> 45:19.891
Officers stick
together always.

45:19.934 --> 45:21.936
How do you know Curzon
and the Fusiliers

45:21.980 --> 45:23.938
aren't sending some
fucker to do you in?

45:23.982 --> 45:26.419
I don't.Don't you worry, Baz.

45:26.462 --> 45:28.247
Who they gonna send, eh?

45:28.290 --> 45:30.945
I'd like to see
the regular army boys

45:30.989 --> 45:32.860
that are gallus
enough to try us.

45:32.904 --> 45:35.907
The famous last words
of many good men.

45:45.612 --> 45:46.918
You're betting blind, Alfie.

45:46.961 --> 45:48.571
I've got no choice.

45:48.615 --> 45:49.921
This is Curzon's game.

45:49.964 --> 45:51.444
I have to play the cards
in front of me.

45:52.924 --> 45:55.143
SID:
Well, lads, same again?

45:55.187 --> 45:57.015
Aye.Any squaddies been in?

45:57.058 --> 45:58.712
Squaddies? No.
I don't encourage 'em.

46:00.061 --> 46:01.497
Barring present company,

46:01.541 --> 46:03.978
naturally.

46:04.022 --> 46:06.198
Sandra not about?She's upstairs.

46:06.241 --> 46:08.635
She's got the hump with you.
She won't say why.

46:08.678 --> 46:10.376
Oh, that's funny.

46:10.419 --> 46:11.812
SID:
Yeah, funny that.

46:11.856 --> 46:13.596
What's that about, then?

46:13.640 --> 46:15.120
Couldn't tell you.

46:15.163 --> 46:18.384
Funny.

46:18.427 --> 46:21.213
I'll have a word
when I see her.

46:21.256 --> 46:24.216
But listen,
if I don't see her,

46:24.259 --> 46:26.609
tell her I say I'm sorry.About what?

46:26.653 --> 46:27.741
Well, whatever it is.

46:29.874 --> 46:31.353
Right.

46:51.896 --> 46:53.419
Your man will be there
tomorrow night.

46:53.462 --> 46:54.812
Room seven.

46:57.553 --> 47:00.513
ALFRED: This is from
General Malcolm.

47:03.037 --> 47:06.693
DAVEBOY:
See, Mr. Doom and Gloom?

47:06.736 --> 47:09.435
No bother.BAZZA: Or a trap.

47:11.219 --> 47:12.307
We better go in early

47:12.351 --> 47:14.353
and heavy.

47:14.396 --> 47:15.658
No, I don't think so.

47:15.702 --> 47:18.052
I think this is a one-man job.No.

47:18.096 --> 47:20.141
It's not.
Don't be daft.

47:20.185 --> 47:22.883
You're in a dark
frame of mind, Alfred.

47:22.927 --> 47:24.015
You must treat this man

47:24.058 --> 47:25.407
like any other target.

47:25.451 --> 47:27.061
You could be taking on
a whole regiment.

47:27.105 --> 47:29.281
Well, then, one or two more men
won't make any odds, will they?

47:29.324 --> 47:31.413
No, I know this place.

47:31.457 --> 47:33.024
It's a one-man job. Cheers.

Your lady doctor.

Oh, I like that color.

48:27.992 --> 48:29.558
Do me next, eh?

48:29.602 --> 48:32.083
As it happens, my dear,
I think I can offer you

48:32.126 --> 48:35.477
a much better service
than that.

48:35.521 --> 48:38.350
I've been talking quietly to
some old Raven Society friends.

48:38.393 --> 48:40.352
Well-connected types.

48:40.395 --> 48:43.007
And there's news of your old
friend, Alfred Pennyworth.

48:43.050 --> 48:45.139
Oh?

48:45.183 --> 48:46.619
Resourceful young man.

48:46.662 --> 48:48.577
It seems he's found out
who killed his fiancée.

48:51.754 --> 48:52.842
Esme.

48:52.886 --> 48:55.193
I thought you'd like to know.

48:55.236 --> 48:58.848
Who did it?
Where are they?

49:06.639 --> 49:09.294
MARTHA:
Thomas.

49:09.337 --> 49:10.948
Huh?

49:10.991 --> 49:13.602
Will you please tell us
what happened?

49:20.479 --> 49:22.960
Nothing happened.

49:23.003 --> 49:24.787
You saw him, didn't you?

49:29.488 --> 49:31.446
We were never there.

49:33.448 --> 49:35.842
Not any of us.

49:35.885 --> 49:37.278
You understand?

49:50.813 --> 49:51.945
You saw him.

49:59.039 --> 50:00.823
No.

51:11.068 --> 51:12.199
You?!

51:12.243 --> 51:15.072
Shh! Quiet.

51:15.115 --> 51:17.857
ALFRED:
Hey, you're supposed to be dead.

51:17.900 --> 51:19.293
SYKES:
Well, I'm not, am I?

51:19.337 --> 51:20.425
Let's get on with it.

51:31.566 --> 51:33.481
How do you know
it's him?

51:33.525 --> 51:35.440
Let me handle this.

51:50.759 --> 51:51.847
Come on.

52:05.034 --> 52:06.819
Get the bastard!

53:29.162 --> 53:30.772
You're supposed to be dead.

53:30.816 --> 53:33.297
Well, I'm not, am I?

53:33.340 --> 53:36.996
That was your bloody doing.

53:37.039 --> 53:38.258
I had the bastard.

53:41.522 --> 53:45.570
GAUNT:
Our enemies call us zealots.

53:45.613 --> 53:48.181
And they are correct.

53:48.225 --> 53:51.402
Zealots we are, and proud of it.

53:53.882 --> 53:57.712
When did rigor and discipline

53:57.756 --> 54:02.195
and duty become terms of abuse?

54:02.239 --> 54:06.417
And who were the great
men and women of history

54:06.460 --> 54:08.636
who changed the world?

54:08.680 --> 54:11.422
Moderates? No!

54:11.465 --> 54:14.207
Zealots, like you and I!

54:14.251 --> 54:15.208
People of faith.

54:17.341 --> 54:18.994
MAN: That's right!MAN 2: Well said.

54:19.038 --> 54:23.216
Those citizens that are not

54:23.260 --> 54:25.174
loyal patriots

54:25.218 --> 54:27.960
shall be silenced.

54:28.003 --> 54:31.877
Those foreigners
who are not our friends

54:31.920 --> 54:33.618
shall be expelled.

54:35.794 --> 54:40.146
We shall put down
sexual deviants,

54:40.189 --> 54:41.974
and we shall hang thieves!

54:44.933 --> 54:46.413
Yes!

54:48.502 --> 54:51.679
The Raven Society,
ladies and gentlemen,

54:51.723 --> 54:55.770
is on the cusp of a new dawn.

54:55.814 --> 55:00.645
We shall lurk in the shadows
no longer.

55:00.688 --> 55:06.346
A revelation is coming
that will shock the world.

55:06.390 --> 55:08.130
I promise you,

55:08.174 --> 55:10.350
it'll shock the world!

55:10.394 --> 55:12.265
Are you with me?!

55:13.484 --> 55:15.573
Are you with me?! Yes!
