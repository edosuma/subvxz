16:01.320 --> 16:03.390
- Can I get a lemonade?
- I'll also do a lemonade.

16:03.460 --> 16:04.520
- Lemonade.

16:04.530 --> 16:05.930
- Gonna have a Hot and Bothered.

16:05.990 --> 16:06.930
- Hot and Bothered.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.200
- I'll just have my water.
- Water's good.

16:11.260 --> 16:12.400
- Thank you.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.670
So much fun to have you guys
all here.

16:14.670 --> 16:16.540
You know, I just love that.
It's so important to me.

16:16.540 --> 16:19.100
- How long has it been
since we've all been together?

16:19.170 --> 16:20.970
- You haven't been out here
for four years.

16:21.040 --> 16:21.870
- Okay.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.540
- There you go,
Hot and Bothered.

16:23.610 --> 16:25.050
- Oh, wow.

16:25.110 --> 16:27.280
<i>It's hard with all
of the girls' activities.</i>

16:27.350 --> 16:29.180
<i>It's just been much easier</i>

16:29.250 --> 16:30.980
for my mother
to come and visit us.

16:31.050 --> 16:32.490
<i>But being here right now</i>

16:32.550 --> 16:34.950
<i>and seeing how happy
my mom is here,</i>

16:35.020 --> 16:39.260
in her city, I need to come
out here more often.

16:39.260 --> 16:40.360
- So cheers...
- Cheers.

16:40.430 --> 16:42.500
- To us all being together

16:42.560 --> 16:45.230
for the first time
in a long time.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.430
- If you could pick
to live anywhere, G-ma,

16:47.500 --> 16:48.570
would you still live here?

16:48.640 --> 16:51.040
- Yeah, I love it here.
I really do.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.170
- You're happy here.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.910
And I just feel bad that
I haven't come out that much.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.010
Like, when you're here,
you just--I feel guilty.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.380
- Well, Shannon, from the
last time you were out here,

16:59.380 --> 17:02.310
you've gone through
a miserable divorce.

17:02.380 --> 17:04.320
- Sometimes I'll have thoughts
about that affair,

17:04.380 --> 17:06.190
and then I think,
will I really ever get over it?

17:06.250 --> 17:08.320
- Concentrate more
on your own life

17:08.390 --> 17:09.990
and what the things
you wanna do.

17:10.060 --> 17:13.090
And you've got three
of the most wonderful girls.

17:13.090 --> 17:14.530
And that should make you happy.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.600
And you've done such a good job.

17:17.660 --> 17:21.400
And you've had to deal with
your girls getting hurt a lot.

17:21.470 --> 17:24.600
- I feel bad,
and I worry about you guys.

17:24.670 --> 17:27.410
You were exposed to

17:27.470 --> 17:30.280
a not--a not--
An unhealthy marriage.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.680
- Well, so were you.

17:31.750 --> 17:35.620
- My parents got divorced
when I was 17 years old.

17:35.680 --> 17:39.020
<i>You know, you repeat patterns
that you experienced</i>

17:39.020 --> 17:40.020
<i>in your childhood.</i>

17:40.090 --> 17:42.620
Yeah, I'm the living example
of that.

17:42.690 --> 17:46.090
I don't want my children
to continue the patterns.

17:46.090 --> 17:48.360
I want them to break the cycle.

17:48.430 --> 17:51.330
Do you see yourself
being married someday?

17:51.330 --> 17:52.260
- Of course.
- Do you wanna be married

17:52.330 --> 17:53.930
with a family?
- I see myself marrying Reese.

17:55.570 --> 17:57.100
- She can't--shut up.

17:59.570 --> 18:00.970
- How long
have you been dating Reese?

18:01.040 --> 18:03.080
- Two months.

18:03.140 --> 18:05.080
- It's basically been
four months.

18:05.150 --> 18:06.110
- Okay.

18:06.180 --> 18:08.350
I got married at 36.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.950
<i>She's, like, 20.</i>

18:11.450 --> 18:12.750
- Well, I got married at 21.

18:12.820 --> 18:14.590
- You almost got engaged
in college.

18:14.590 --> 18:16.390
- I did. I dated someone at 18.

18:16.460 --> 18:18.790
And had I met him at 30,
we would have been engaged

18:18.790 --> 18:20.660
within six months.
I just met him too young.

18:20.660 --> 18:22.930
- Yeah,
and I would rather be younger.

18:24.260 --> 18:26.330
I've never been
in a relationship before,

18:26.400 --> 18:28.200
so this is all really new to me.

18:28.270 --> 18:29.740
- You got plenty of time,
Sophie.

18:29.740 --> 18:31.740
- Obviously,
she's a little nervous

18:31.740 --> 18:33.410
'cause she doesn't want me
to get hurt.

18:33.470 --> 18:35.740
- Don't move so fast.
Just take a breath.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.410
- I live 1,200 miles away,

18:38.410 --> 18:40.680
so I'm already on my own
as it is.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.550
- Got a long life ahead.

18:42.620 --> 18:46.650
Look what I started at 56--55.

18:46.650 --> 18:49.250
That's when
my good part started, so...

18:49.320 --> 18:51.190
- He's, like,
the healthiest relationship

18:51.260 --> 18:52.360
that I could have ever
asked for.

18:52.430 --> 18:56.160
He's everything that I never
got to experience as a kid.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.500
- That breaks my heart.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.570
- If we're getting
really into it,

18:59.630 --> 19:02.440
sometimes I feel like,
"Oh, I don't deserve it."

19:02.440 --> 19:05.500
Or, like, I feel
unworthy of that, you know?

19:05.570 --> 19:07.170
- You shouldn't think that way.

19:07.170 --> 19:09.710
You've gone through a horrible
thing with that divorce.

19:09.780 --> 19:12.250
All children go through
horrible things,

19:12.310 --> 19:15.380
and it's sad
because it's not your fault.

19:15.450 --> 19:19.390
- I know for a fact that
my kids are still carrying

19:19.450 --> 19:23.060
everything that continues
to happen

19:23.120 --> 19:26.260
with my marriage to David.

19:26.330 --> 19:27.790
It's--it weighs on them.

19:27.800 --> 19:31.730
You deserve everything.
And I love that you're happy.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.470
It means the world to me.
- It means the world to me too.

19:34.470 --> 19:36.140
- Look at this deep convo.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.740
- With mascara
going down my face.

19:38.740 --> 19:40.870
- Love G-ma.

19:40.940 --> 19:42.610
- My little baby.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.680
- How do you feel, Adaline?
- Good.

19:44.740 --> 19:46.680

This is a shrine

- Thank you.

21:36.320 --> 21:37.260
I'm kinda just numb.

- You know, I-I just wanted
to talk to you.

21:39.660 --> 21:41.990
I've heard some things,
and I feel weird

21:42.060 --> 21:43.800
not saying something.

21:43.860 --> 21:46.870
So I just--you know,
I wanted to sit down with you

21:46.870 --> 21:48.200
and just...
- I'm happy to--

21:48.270 --> 21:51.800
- Talk to you and hear
kinda what's going on.

21:51.870 --> 21:55.270
Nicole told me that you
called me either a phony bitch

21:55.280 --> 21:57.480
or a fake bitch.

22:05.550 --> 22:07.550
- I've heard some things,
and it's kind of escalated

22:07.620 --> 22:10.560
to the point where I feel weird
not saying something.

22:10.620 --> 22:14.160
Nicole told me that you
called me either a phony bitch

22:14.230 --> 22:15.960
or a fake bitch.

22:16.030 --> 22:18.360
- Heather will be supportive.
- [laughs]

22:18.370 --> 22:20.500
What the (BLEEP) does that,
like, fake bitch

22:20.570 --> 22:22.840
have to say right now?
- What?

22:22.900 --> 22:25.340
- I knew, going into
that lunch, I was very raw.

22:25.410 --> 22:27.040
I was very emotional.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.310
The person I'm really angry
with, obviously, is James.

22:30.380 --> 22:32.980
But your name got brought up,
and it was literally like,

22:33.050 --> 22:35.350
"(BLEEP) phony bullsh--."

22:35.420 --> 22:37.650
I lashed out. I got angry.
- So misplaced aggression.

22:37.720 --> 22:38.850
- 100%.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.320
- I understand all that.

22:40.390 --> 22:42.250
When I heard that, I was like,
"You know what?

22:42.320 --> 22:44.660
"She's going through a lot.
I'm just gonna...

22:44.660 --> 22:46.930
I'ma let that one go."
- Like a class act would.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.190
- "I'm gonna let that one go."

22:48.260 --> 22:50.260
Then there was more.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.800
Gina told me

22:53.870 --> 22:56.740
that you had said to her
that I wasn't to be trusted.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.670
- Noella yesterday
was just basically warning me

22:59.740 --> 23:01.680
to be careful of you.

23:01.740 --> 23:04.540
And she felt
that I needed to be...

23:04.610 --> 23:06.550
- Wary of me. Yeah.
- On the defense. Yeah.

23:06.610 --> 23:09.020
- Well,
why am I not to be trusted?

23:09.080 --> 23:10.750
- Remember how I said
that Nicole has told me

23:10.820 --> 23:12.350
a lot of things about her life?

23:12.420 --> 23:13.820
I was the one who called her

23:13.890 --> 23:15.950
after she left your house party.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.890
And then after she spoke
with you,

23:17.960 --> 23:19.560
everything had changed.

23:19.630 --> 23:21.430
And that was
a little bizarre to me.

23:21.430 --> 23:23.360
- I don't know
what we're talking about

23:23.360 --> 23:25.630
'cause we're speaking
very cryptically.

23:25.700 --> 23:28.370
But all I can tell you is--
- About the lawsuit with Terry.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.540
- Are you Nicole Weise?

23:30.540 --> 23:32.740
You sued me.

23:32.810 --> 23:35.710
- I don't know why that makes
you distrustful of me.

23:35.780 --> 23:37.980
I still am not hearing
how I did something--

23:38.040 --> 23:41.310
- No, no, no, I'm just saying
that I saw my girlfriend change

23:41.380 --> 23:43.650
based on a phone call
that she had with you.

23:43.720 --> 23:46.390
- You went through something...
- I am good.

23:46.450 --> 23:47.920
- That was real.
- It's over.

23:47.990 --> 23:49.920
I appreciate your concern.

23:49.990 --> 23:51.730
But I'm done with this topic
and this conversation.

23:51.790 --> 23:52.760
- Okay.

23:52.830 --> 23:55.060
Heather telling her
to drop any conversation

23:55.130 --> 23:58.700
of the lawsuit,
that's a little disturbing.

23:58.770 --> 23:59.930
- I feel like, you know...
- I'm telling you--

23:59.930 --> 24:01.470
- If we're starting
to be friends

24:01.470 --> 24:03.070
of if there's a chance
for a friendship,

24:03.140 --> 24:05.740
this isn't the way
to start a friendship.

24:05.810 --> 24:07.640
And if you have
a problem with me--

24:07.710 --> 24:09.510
- The start of our friendship
was in your house

24:09.510 --> 24:10.810
with you slamming people
against walls

24:10.880 --> 24:12.410
and yelling at people and--

24:12.480 --> 24:13.880
- Slamming people against walls?

24:13.950 --> 24:16.010
- I heard it.
I was right near the staircase.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.650
But it was--
- What are you talking about?

24:17.720 --> 24:19.720
- It was a--
- Slamming against walls?

24:19.720 --> 24:22.090
- The night
of Heather's Nobu party,

24:22.090 --> 24:25.360
<i>somebody told me
Terry and Heather</i>

24:25.430 --> 24:29.430
were shoving somebody
against a wall.

24:29.500 --> 24:32.830
- No, no, literally,
we are camera down.

24:32.900 --> 24:34.500
- What is going on?

24:36.870 --> 24:39.040
- I didn't slam anyone
against a wall.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.110
- Okay.

24:40.170 --> 24:43.780
- What I'm getting right now
is, like, psycho vibes.

24:43.840 --> 24:46.850
What are you ----ing
talking about?

24:46.910 --> 24:49.450

41:49.940 --> 41:51.070
But I have to pee so bad.

41:51.140 --> 41:54.570
I have to--I had so many shots.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.210
- I don't do that very often.

41:58.210 --> 42:00.080
Shane, come with me.
Come in here with me.

42:01.210 --> 42:02.850
- No, come with me.
Come with me.

42:11.020 --> 42:12.760
- Does that mean butt sex
is possible?

42:12.820 --> 42:14.790
- Okay, I'll let you do that.

42:14.790 --> 42:15.830

42:15.830 --> 42:17.630

of Orange County"...</i>

42:17.700 --> 42:19.630
- Cabo San Lucas!

42:19.700 --> 42:21.800
<i>[all cheering]</i>

42:21.800 --> 42:22.900
<i>- This way, please.</i>

42:22.970 --> 42:24.600
<i>- Muy bonita.</i>

42:24.670 --> 42:26.610
<i>- It looks like
a ----ing postcard.</i>

42:26.670 --> 42:28.610
- Yes.
And we're the party room.

42:28.670 --> 42:30.210
- Yeah, if I invite you.

42:30.280 --> 42:32.210
- Only if I'm invited.

42:32.210 --> 42:33.950
- Yes, Emily!

42:34.010 --> 42:35.580
You look born
to ride that thing.

42:35.650 --> 42:36.710
- It was fun.
Isn't that beautiful?

42:36.780 --> 42:38.450
- So beautiful.
My vagina hurts.

42:38.520 --> 42:40.090
- Yay--whoa!

42:41.590 --> 42:43.050
I don't know.
- What are you doing?

42:43.120 --> 42:45.790
- I know you and Noella
are not thick as thieves,

42:45.860 --> 42:47.190
but she's like, "Well,
I guess I'm gonna be

42:47.260 --> 42:49.060
"kind of, like, lonely
the next couple of days

42:49.130 --> 42:50.630
because I'm not going to Cabo."

42:50.700 --> 42:53.660
- Give me the reason
why this is a great idea.

42:53.730 --> 42:56.070
- I felt like
if we just got here

42:56.130 --> 42:58.940
that Heather and Noella
could bond.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.100
- No, I don't see it happening.

43:00.170 --> 43:01.810

43:01.870 --> 43:04.210
- I'm gonna ----ing cry
'cause I'm kinda having

43:04.280 --> 43:05.910
a ----ing breakdown.

43:08.210 --> 43:10.150

43:10.220 --> 43:12.480
- Oh, how beautiful.
- Wow.

43:12.550 --> 43:13.890
- This is stunning.

43:15.560 --> 43:17.090
- Sit anywhere.

43:17.160 --> 43:19.020
- Look at the chiquita.

43:19.090 --> 43:20.790
- Hi!
