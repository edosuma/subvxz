WEBVTT

00:12.096 --> 00:14.722
What is it
you wish to ask
the gods?

00:20.270 --> 00:23.648
Will I ever bear
another child, o wise one?

00:27.820 --> 00:31.739
I cannot see another child.
No matter how far I look.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.913
Then what do you see?

00:40.624 --> 00:43.835
I see a harvest
celebrated in blood.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.131
I see a trickster
whose weapon cleaves you.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.592
I see a city
made of marble.

00:51.677 --> 00:54.470
And a burning,
broiling ocean.

00:55.514 --> 00:58.433
Not one of
your prophecies
do I understand.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.351
It is the way
of prophecy.

01:00.436 --> 01:03.271
Only to be understood
when it has happened,

01:03.731 --> 01:06.482
and it is too late
to change it.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.949
When will I die?

01:15.784 --> 01:20.163
Frigg, the wife
of Odin, has already
made a decision.

01:20.372 --> 01:23.416
But it has not yet
been vouchsafed to me.

01:25.169 --> 01:26.961
Come back
another day,

01:27.212 --> 01:29.088
Earl and shield-maiden,

01:30.007 --> 01:32.592
and perhaps I may tell you

01:32.676 --> 01:35.428
exactly the moment
of your death.

01:51.445 --> 01:55.782
When the ice
finally breaks, we will
go back to Wessex

01:55.866 --> 01:59.452
and claim the land
that King Ecbert promised us.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.956
You know,
that was
always my dream.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.795
I feel
my blood warming.

02:09.338 --> 02:12.131
I want to fight.
I want to raid.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.554
Why do you want
to fight?

02:21.934 --> 02:24.185
And what are
you fighting for?

02:26.563 --> 02:27.688
That.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.419
What do you see?

02:52.297 --> 02:53.506
Power.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.134
The power
of a king.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.012
Power is
always dangerous.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.975
It attracts the worst.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.520
And corrupts the best.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.648
I never asked
for power.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.151
Power is only
given to those

03:14.236 --> 03:17.989
who are prepared
to lower themselves
to pick it up.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.623
Einar.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.052
Sit down, Kalf.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.889
Will you come
with me to Wessex?

05:07.391 --> 05:09.767
No, Earl Ingstad.

05:10.686 --> 05:11.936
Why not?

05:12.020 --> 05:13.896
Don't you want
to win renown?

05:13.981 --> 05:15.773
Of course I do.

05:15.857 --> 05:16.983
But someone
has to remain

05:17.067 --> 05:19.026
and look after
all your territories,

05:19.111 --> 05:21.404
and all of your
interests here.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.741
I believe you trust me
to do this.

05:29.705 --> 05:30.788
I do.

05:31.415 --> 05:34.917
In this last year
you have earned my
trust in many ways.

05:36.795 --> 05:40.131
When your mother was dying,
I promised that I would
take care of you

05:41.425 --> 05:43.634
but sometimes it seems
the other way around.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.643
I have received
another offer of marriage.

05:54.104 --> 05:57.356
Egill Sokkason has
proposed himself.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.736
You could do worse.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.321
He has a good
turf-cutting business.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.240
At least I'd be
warm all winter.

06:11.455 --> 06:14.457
Why don't you offer
to marry me, Kalf?

06:14.541 --> 06:17.626
You've made yourself
almost indispensable
to me.

06:19.838 --> 06:23.924
I have nothing
to offer you
but a capable head.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.011
Let me be the judge
of that.

06:27.971 --> 06:31.807
People would assume
that I'd sought the
marriage out of ambition.

06:32.559 --> 06:35.644
It would do
neither of us
any good.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.407
Tell me about Einar.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.785
Einar still
hates you.

06:50.869 --> 06:54.330
He continues
trying to persuade
members of his family

06:54.456 --> 06:56.582
to rise up against you

06:56.666 --> 06:58.542
and restore
the old dynasty.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.505
What to do?

07:24.152 --> 07:27.696
I was thinking
how it will be onboard
one of these ships.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.699
Sailing across
the sea to England.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.995
We have not talked
about it yet.

07:37.165 --> 07:40.000
I am not sure I want you
to come with us to Wessex.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.460
I am ready.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.713
I have endured many
hours of training.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.007
Lagertha herself
even helped me.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.719
But what if you are
with child already?

07:51.847 --> 07:52.930
If I lost you,

07:53.014 --> 07:55.349
then I would also
lose my child.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.059
I am coming with you!

07:58.645 --> 08:00.312
You can't stop me.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.110
I'm going
to cook you little piggies.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.571
Oh...and eat you
for dinner.

08:09.281 --> 08:11.156
Whoa!

08:20.083 --> 08:21.375
What are you laughing at?

08:22.919 --> 08:24.003
Ahh!

08:41.771 --> 08:44.356
Please don't stop
playing on our account.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.484
Oh, yeah,
we had finished.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.363
Oh...

08:52.240 --> 08:53.824
How is Boneless?

08:55.160 --> 08:57.745
Ivar is what he is.
You know that.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.498
Me and the boys.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.794
You and the boys.

09:06.755 --> 09:07.880
Yes.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.299
Me and the boys.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.642
You know I live for my sons.

09:22.938 --> 09:23.938
All of them?

09:30.111 --> 09:31.487
I know you
love your sons, Ragnar.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.905
You don't need to tell me.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.514
We are such a happy family.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.183
And what is wrong
with that, Floki?

10:01.768 --> 10:03.686
Families are
not happy.

10:04.896 --> 10:07.773
Name me
one family
which is happy.

10:07.857 --> 10:08.941
Ragnar's.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.151
Which one?

10:13.863 --> 10:15.614
Just look
at her.

10:15.699 --> 10:18.409
Yeah, but it makes
me too happy, Helga.

10:18.493 --> 10:19.535
You don't love
your daughter?

10:19.619 --> 10:20.703
No, that's not
what I meant.

10:20.787 --> 10:21.787
That's not...

10:21.871 --> 10:23.122
Well, then explain
it to me!

10:23.206 --> 10:27.334
I feel trapped,
in all this happiness.

10:27.419 --> 10:28.752
I feel trapped,
Helga.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.422
We do not want
to trap you, Floki.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.799
If you want to leave us,
you should leave.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.218
You're too reasonable,
Helga. It doesn't help.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.553
Why are you not angry
with me?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.680
Yes, I am angry
with you, Floki.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.308
But it doesn't
help either.

10:44.728 --> 10:48.272
Perhaps when you
get back from Wessex
you will see sense.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.025
Perhaps I will die
in Wessex.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.237
Where are you going?

10:55.321 --> 10:57.281
Away! Just away!

10:57.365 --> 10:59.825
You're so
horribly good,
Helga!

11:13.965 --> 11:15.632
What is
the matter with him?

11:17.886 --> 11:19.344
How do I know?

11:19.429 --> 11:21.555
But you see
how he suffers.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.516
And I cannot
make it better.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.312
Do you even care?

11:30.315 --> 11:32.441
Yes, I care.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.451
Do you love him?

11:43.953 --> 11:45.788
Of course I love him.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.460
Do you love me?

12:43.596 --> 12:44.972
She's gone.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.100
Now we can talk.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.186
Talk of what, Einar?

12:52.772 --> 12:56.066
Of betrayal,
of murder?

12:56.609 --> 12:59.695
No, not with me.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.275
That's all I have.
All right.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.490
Thank you.
Thank you.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.068
Do you offer me
no warmth now, Siggy?

14:29.786 --> 14:31.244
What do you expect?

14:37.627 --> 14:40.003
Sometimes, I remember when
I could have been a queen.

14:41.798 --> 14:42.839
Now look what I have.

14:44.801 --> 14:45.801
You mean me.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.676
If Lagertha and I were to

15:28.302 --> 15:31.013
invite you to
share our bed today...

15:32.682 --> 15:35.017
would you still refuse us,
even today?

15:47.864 --> 15:49.948
I know you well,
my friend.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.535
And I know
what tortures you.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.666
But what choice
do you have?

16:01.127 --> 16:04.838
You can neither
hide from your God,
nor ours.

16:08.051 --> 16:10.385
I suffer from
that same dilemma,

16:12.221 --> 16:13.805
only in reverse.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.812
We will go together
to Wessex

16:21.314 --> 16:23.565
and you will be
my John the, um...

16:24.609 --> 16:25.609
The Baptist?

16:25.693 --> 16:27.152
John the Baptist, yes.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.820
Wherever you go,

16:30.198 --> 16:31.698
I will follow.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.414
Perhaps I'll even
put my hair like a monk.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.090
Go and get warm.

16:55.681 --> 16:56.681
What are you doing?

16:58.267 --> 16:59.559
I'm following you, John.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.283
Torstein!

17:17.370 --> 17:18.995
I have a problem.

17:19.747 --> 17:23.917
Two women.
Both claim to be
carrying my child.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.253
Is it possible?

17:29.298 --> 17:30.715
Why don't you
marry both of them?

17:30.800 --> 17:33.927
Take one as a wife,
the other as a...

17:34.011 --> 17:35.470
- Concubine?
- No.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.931
They hate each other.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.809
They want to kill
each other. Or kill me.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.980
Please, just tell me,
when are we sailing
out of here?

18:16.846 --> 18:18.013
Rollo!

18:18.931 --> 18:21.766
You cannot understand!
I'm so happy!

18:21.851 --> 18:23.935
I'm so happy
we're leaving.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.315
Believe me, Floki,

18:28.399 --> 18:30.358
I understand completely.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.870
What have
I told you, Torstein?

18:41.954 --> 18:43.663
Always keep that
ax in your pants,

18:43.748 --> 18:45.874
if you want
to avoid troubles.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.834
Well, some of us

18:47.919 --> 18:50.420
have to bring our
troubles with us.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.334
She wanted
to come with us?

19:29.627 --> 19:31.419
I could not stop her.

19:32.755 --> 19:35.423
She reminds me of
someone else I know.

20:43.117 --> 20:45.285
Time to die, Einar.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.172
I want to die
with an ax
in my hand.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.591
As though
I had died
in battle.

21:01.052 --> 21:03.303
Surely you won't
deny me that?

21:05.681 --> 21:07.098
You're joking.

21:07.183 --> 21:10.518
Why would a man
about to die joke
about such things?

21:13.939 --> 21:16.274
Will you give me
the ax, or not?

21:41.050 --> 21:42.926
Your gift was foolish.

21:44.929 --> 21:47.305
I don't think you'll
use it against me.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.391
Oh, why not?

21:50.476 --> 21:52.644
If you kill
an unarmed man,

21:52.728 --> 21:56.439
then you really are
the coward Lagertha
thinks you are.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.859
But, in any case,

22:01.070 --> 22:03.613
would you really kill
your own Earl?

22:05.908 --> 22:07.158
My Earl?

22:08.577 --> 22:11.830
Persuade your family
to support me as Earl,

22:12.706 --> 22:16.292
and we will get rid
of the woman
who usurped your uncle.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.378
What does she do
for us?

22:18.462 --> 22:21.089
She goes raiding
with Ragnar Lothbrok.

22:24.135 --> 22:25.885
I had no idea.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.763
And that is
the beauty of it.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.476
Ragnar and Lagertha

22:34.270 --> 22:36.104
talk only of farming.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.275
Farming.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.736
Who wants to go
places and farm?

22:44.697 --> 22:46.781
Where is the glory
in that, Einar?

22:47.783 --> 22:49.909
Where is the glory in that?

23:44.506 --> 23:46.007
Welcome near!

23:46.383 --> 23:49.427
I bid you all welcome.

23:51.013 --> 23:52.513
Earl Ragnar.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.390
He is King now.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.185
King Ragnar Lothbrok.

24:01.190 --> 24:02.815
What happened
to King Horik?

24:02.900 --> 24:04.359
He met with a, uh,

24:05.819 --> 24:07.612
unfortunate accident.

24:10.699 --> 24:13.034
Then we are truly equal.

24:14.370 --> 24:19.457
It is my pleasure
to feed you and prove
the bounty of our Earth.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.334
What has happened
to our people

24:21.418 --> 24:23.211
who chose to fight
for Mercia?

24:27.383 --> 24:29.509
Unfortunately,
the forces of my uncle

24:29.593 --> 24:31.844
and younger brother
have prevailed.

24:32.513 --> 24:36.015
But if you,
Ragnar Lothbrok,
and you, Lagertha,

24:36.100 --> 24:38.476
would join with us,
I am sure of victory.

24:57.371 --> 25:00.999
Um, King Ragnar,
I have given you land.

25:01.083 --> 25:04.836
Let me tell you the truth,
as God is my witness,

25:04.920 --> 25:08.006
some of my nobles
do not agree with
what I have done.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.424
They are afraid.

25:09.550 --> 25:13.428
But I am determined
to honor our treaty.

25:13.512 --> 25:17.140
In return,
some of you, at least,

25:17.224 --> 25:19.225
must fight
for Princess Kwenthrith.

25:20.894 --> 25:24.981
That is not part of
our original agreement,

25:27.234 --> 25:28.443
but...

25:29.653 --> 25:31.529
In good faith,

25:31.613 --> 25:33.156
and in hopes

25:33.240 --> 25:35.658
of creating
a long and prosperous

25:36.744 --> 25:38.119
friendship,

25:40.414 --> 25:41.748
I will fight.

25:44.626 --> 25:47.045
But I cannot speak
for the others.

25:48.297 --> 25:49.797
I will fight,

25:50.049 --> 25:52.258
alongside these pagans.

25:53.302 --> 25:54.635
For Mercia.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.320
Bjorn?

26:51.777 --> 26:54.529
All have agreed,
except Lagertha.

26:55.989 --> 26:56.989
Earl?

26:59.410 --> 27:01.285
Go and translate
to Lagertha for me.

27:01.370 --> 27:05.957
In order to establish
the settlement here in Wessex,

27:06.041 --> 27:09.127
I need the help of
one of your leaders.

27:09.211 --> 27:11.045
A strong leader.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.880
Someone that my nobles
will respect.

27:39.116 --> 27:40.575
She agrees
to remain in Wessex,

27:40.868 --> 27:44.287
to establish the
settlement and to
help farm the land.

27:44.955 --> 27:47.373
And you
also must stay,
Athelstan.

27:47.458 --> 27:50.543
You can speak
for all sides.
We need you.

27:51.628 --> 27:53.004
I need you.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.514
I trust you more
than anyone else.

28:05.434 --> 28:06.934
I think you should stay.

28:07.728 --> 28:09.395
Then I shall stay.

28:15.486 --> 28:16.777
Skol!

28:17.112 --> 28:19.071
Skol!

28:33.795 --> 28:34.795
Athelstan...

28:36.131 --> 28:40.426
I rejoice with all my heart
to see you again.

28:43.847 --> 28:44.847
How are you?

28:46.642 --> 28:47.642
Within yourself?

28:50.062 --> 28:51.812
I'm well, sire.

28:53.482 --> 28:54.899
Thank God.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.500
You left this behind.

29:16.838 --> 29:17.838
I...

29:19.174 --> 29:20.341
Go on, take it.

30:04.636 --> 30:07.096
May the gods
go with you and
protect you, my son.

30:11.226 --> 30:12.268
Princess.

30:12.352 --> 30:15.896
I just wanted to wish
you and your people
good fortune.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.440
My prayers
go with you.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.900
Thank you, my lady.

30:20.736 --> 30:22.612
May I touch
your hand?

30:24.114 --> 30:25.364
My hand?

30:25.449 --> 30:27.158
They told me
you were crucified.

30:27.242 --> 30:30.077
And you still
bear the stigmata
of Christ.

30:30.579 --> 30:32.079
It's not true.

30:32.581 --> 30:34.165
Then why not
show me
your hand?

30:35.334 --> 30:36.584
I...

30:38.587 --> 30:40.129
It is true.

30:54.269 --> 30:56.020
I bid you
goodbye, wife.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.438
Fare you well,
husband.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.106
Go safely.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.277
Take care of our child.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.530
And wait patiently
for my return.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.810
You do not
have to come
with us.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.020
You can go with
Lagertha and
the other settlers.

31:42.526 --> 31:44.068
I love you.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.656
And I think
you are already
with child.

32:27.863 --> 32:29.113
Away.

33:13.366 --> 33:16.076
Are you happy
about doing this,
brother?

33:19.456 --> 33:23.542
Since when does any of this
have anything to do
with my happiness?

34:26.273 --> 34:28.399
Tell me about your uncle.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.484
My uncle's
name is Brihtwulf.

34:31.152 --> 34:33.904
Though he calls himself
King Brihtwulf now.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.906
He has no right to do so.

34:35.991 --> 34:37.992
He has usurped my crown.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.078
And your younger brother?

34:41.913 --> 34:43.664
His name is Burgred.

34:44.165 --> 34:47.167
We were always close.
And I love him.

34:48.086 --> 34:50.504
Then why does he fight
against you?

34:53.049 --> 34:55.217
My uncle has poisoned
his mind

34:55.343 --> 34:57.469
or used some magic
against him.

34:58.263 --> 34:59.430
Magic?

35:01.975 --> 35:04.977
Has no one ever used magic
against you,

35:05.061 --> 35:06.687
Ragnar Lothbrok?

35:08.148 --> 35:09.315
Think.

35:09.774 --> 35:13.027
A wife?
A brother? A friend?

35:15.155 --> 35:17.489
I have been deceived
many times,

35:20.744 --> 35:23.203
but magic was not
the cause of it.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.616
Ooh, that I could have her.

36:43.243 --> 36:45.035
I'd marry her tomorrow.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.037
And we'd have lots of children

36:47.288 --> 36:48.914
and be true to each other,

36:49.124 --> 36:50.958
forever.

36:52.585 --> 36:55.212
A creaking bow,
a burning flame...

36:55.296 --> 36:59.341
Tide on the ebb,
new ice, a coiled snake.

36:59.426 --> 37:02.136
The sons of a king,
an ailing calf,

37:02.220 --> 37:04.304
a witch's flattery.

37:04.681 --> 37:07.891
No man should be such a fool
as to trust these things.

37:07.976 --> 37:10.686
No man should trust
the word of a woman.

37:12.522 --> 37:15.816
The hearts of women
were turned on
a whirling wheel.

37:16.860 --> 37:18.944
To love a fickle woman
is like setting out

37:19.028 --> 37:21.488
over ice with
a two-year-old colt.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.408
Or sailing a ship
without a rudder.

37:26.411 --> 37:28.370
Whatever my father says,

37:29.205 --> 37:32.040
I can't bring myself
to trust these pagans.

37:32.417 --> 37:36.628
Their way of life is crude,
primitive, ignorant.

37:37.589 --> 37:41.175
They have not been
redeemed by our savior's
love and sacrifice.

37:41.259 --> 37:44.178
They are like
the creatures
of the fields.

37:46.431 --> 37:49.183
I too loved someone
in the same way once.

37:49.893 --> 37:51.894
I sat among the reeds,

37:51.978 --> 37:54.354
waiting and waiting
for my love.

37:55.023 --> 37:57.858
I prized that woman
as much as my own life.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.611
Lot of good it did me.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.697
And what did you get
from sitting in the reeds,

38:04.532 --> 38:06.033
but a wet arse.

38:08.203 --> 38:12.414
I would say,
let no man mock another
over what touches many men.

38:13.875 --> 38:16.919
Time and again the wise
are fettered by beauty.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.588
They ache with love-longing.

38:20.173 --> 38:22.966
Lucky are the fools
like you, Torstein,

38:23.051 --> 38:25.135
who remain unmoved and free.

38:38.441 --> 38:39.775
One day will come a reckoning.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.736
It is just not possible
to imagine a world

38:42.821 --> 38:46.198
in which there is both
one god and several.

38:47.367 --> 38:48.700
One of us must be right.

38:48.785 --> 38:52.538
The Lord sayeth,
"I am the way,
the truth, the light."

39:11.766 --> 39:14.601
He says that the armies
of my uncle and
younger brother

39:14.686 --> 39:16.854
are already
assembled up river.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.605
They wait for us.

39:31.244 --> 39:34.621
We will soon be in Mercia,
and you must fight for me.

39:35.582 --> 39:37.499
And if you are victorious,
I promise that

39:37.584 --> 39:40.794
I shall give you something
worth more than
land or riches.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.107
Shield!

40:03.234 --> 40:04.359
Get down!

40:05.695 --> 40:06.904
Keep rowing!

40:09.157 --> 40:10.741
Row!

40:11.993 --> 40:14.119
Was that your god, or mine?

40:46.235 --> 40:47.402
Get ready!

40:50.281 --> 40:51.698
Whose army is that?

40:51.783 --> 40:53.700
They belong to my
Uncle Brihtwulf.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.411
And that?

40:56.496 --> 40:58.205
My brother Burgred.

41:03.711 --> 41:06.296
That is a considerable
force, father.

41:07.048 --> 41:09.508
If you want to
change your mind, brother,

41:09.592 --> 41:11.218
now is the time!

41:35.535 --> 41:37.744
King Ecbert says
that all this land is yours,

41:37.829 --> 41:39.413
from here to the horizon.

41:39.622 --> 41:42.708
There are many farms
on this land for you
to take possession of.

41:51.426 --> 41:53.510
He wants us
to live in peace.

41:53.594 --> 41:56.388
For that is the future
for all of us now.

42:09.944 --> 42:13.280
The forces on the right bank
are much smaller
than those on the left.

42:13.614 --> 42:15.782
And as far as I can see,
there is no bridge.

42:15.867 --> 42:18.785
There is no way the two armies
can easily rejoin.

42:21.456 --> 42:23.290
We attack your uncle.

42:24.208 --> 42:25.876
Now stay out of our way.

42:26.127 --> 42:27.419
Sound the horn.

42:30.506 --> 42:33.800
Concentrate the full attack
on the right bank.

42:34.135 --> 42:36.053
Starboard!

42:43.895 --> 42:46.646
- They're turning towards us.
- Sound the horns!

42:47.899 --> 42:49.316
Row!

42:55.323 --> 42:57.949
Why are they just
attacking my uncle?

42:59.077 --> 43:00.368
All to the shore!

43:04.999 --> 43:06.541
Prepare for battle!

43:11.672 --> 43:14.091
Don't just stand
and stare. Fire at them!

43:14.175 --> 43:15.425
Archers!

43:15.510 --> 43:16.802
Draw!

43:17.720 --> 43:18.887
Loose!

43:25.436 --> 43:27.104
I cannot help him.

43:32.068 --> 43:33.235
Archers!

43:36.531 --> 43:37.864
Draw!

43:38.741 --> 43:39.783
Shields!

43:39.867 --> 43:41.368
Raise shields!

43:42.745 --> 43:43.912
Loose!

43:52.839 --> 43:54.047
Draw!

43:55.049 --> 43:56.299
Loose!

44:00.304 --> 44:02.055
Thread your arrows!

44:07.895 --> 44:09.354
Spearmen!

44:30.835 --> 44:31.960
Spears!

44:33.546 --> 44:35.589
Don't let them get ashore!

44:49.395 --> 44:50.562
Attack!

46:26.450 --> 46:27.575
Torstein!

47:07.116 --> 47:09.409
Uncle!
