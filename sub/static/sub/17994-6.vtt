00:34.007 --> 00:37.841
in all the seas of the world,
the warm waters of the tropics

00:38.007 --> 00:41.602
contain the richest
and most colourful communities.

00:48.447 --> 00:50.005
Coral reefs.

00:50.167 --> 00:53.557
They may seem
like underwater paradise,

00:53.727 --> 00:58.721
but they are perpetual
battlegrounds for space.

01:02.207 --> 01:05.040
Even the corals
have to fight for it.

01:07.087 --> 01:12.286
in this crowded frenetic community,
every individual needs its place,

01:12.447 --> 01:14.881
its own way of surviving.

01:20.647 --> 01:25.562
None of these creatures would be
here if it were not for the coral.

01:49.447 --> 01:53.326
A coral larva
drifts in the open sea,

01:53.487 --> 01:56.365
floating in a soup
of young reef animals.

02:09.047 --> 02:13.723
if just one of these coral larvae
survives in a suitable spot,

02:13.887 --> 02:16.242
a new reef will be founded.

02:21.447 --> 02:28.159
in just a few days, the larva
changes form and becomes a polyp,

02:28.327 --> 02:30.363
similar to a sea anemone.

02:30.527 --> 02:36.841
identical copies bud off
and, gradually, a colony develops.

02:38.247 --> 02:42.320
Each polyp surrounds itself
with a hard skeleton,

02:42.487 --> 02:46.366
and, from this solid base,
begins to grow.

03:02.327 --> 03:06.400
it increases in length
by an impressive 15cms a year.

03:06.567 --> 03:11.402
This branching coral
is only two years old.

03:11.567 --> 03:14.684
A mature reef can be thousands.

03:26.607 --> 03:29.201
Corals provide the foundations

03:29.367 --> 03:32.518
on which the entire
reef community relies.

03:32.687 --> 03:34.279
Some organisms,

03:34.447 --> 03:39.077
like the Christmas tree worms,
actually live within the coral.

03:45.527 --> 03:49.236
0thers climb out,
away from the reef,

03:49.407 --> 03:52.046
to filter their food
from the water.

04:05.927 --> 04:08.316
As the community grows,

04:08.487 --> 04:10.762
intimate relationships form,

04:10.927 --> 04:15.284
and different creatures
become dependant on one another.

04:18.007 --> 04:22.683
Even animals that spend much
of their time travelling in the ocean

04:22.847 --> 04:25.407
return to the reef for a clean.

04:34.967 --> 04:39.995
Coral reefs can be home
to astounding numbers of fish.

04:53.607 --> 04:59.000
Here swim the smallest
and the largest fish in the sea.

05:05.967 --> 05:09.198
Whale sharks are only visitors.

05:09.367 --> 05:13.406
When currents bring nutrient-rich
water up from the deep,

05:13.567 --> 05:15.558
they come here to feed.

05:25.087 --> 05:27.078
All these animals are here

05:27.247 --> 05:29.124
because of the coral.

05:31.807 --> 05:37.165
This extraordinary complex maze
is built, layer upon layer,

05:37.327 --> 05:41.843
by millions and millions
of individual animals -

05:42.007 --> 05:43.599
polyps.

05:54.927 --> 06:00.081
Each polyp's flesh is supported
by a limestone skeleton.

06:06.327 --> 06:08.318
Below the gut...

06:10.767 --> 06:14.919
..is the place
where most of the growth occurs.

06:15.087 --> 06:20.207
Here, the living tissue deposits
an intricate lattice of limestone.

06:25.527 --> 06:28.997
Beneath that,
the limestone skeleton is bare,

06:29.167 --> 06:32.364
having been vacated
by the living coral tissues.

06:32.527 --> 06:37.476
This is the hard structure
that forms the foundation of the reef.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.878
A single reef can extend
for many miles.

06:57.367 --> 07:00.598
Coral reefs are only found
in the clear, warm,

07:00.767 --> 07:03.122
shallow waters of the tropics.

07:06.127 --> 07:11.155
Sunlight is vital to them,
even though they are animals,

07:11.327 --> 07:17.277
because inside their flesh live
millions of tiny single-cell algae,

07:17.447 --> 07:19.039
plants.

07:20.927 --> 07:26.047
And all plants need sunlight
to photosynthesise sugars.

07:35.487 --> 07:41.005
98% of the food the corals consume
is produced by the algae.

07:43.367 --> 07:44.959
Without them,

07:45.127 --> 07:47.436
the reef would not exist.

07:54.247 --> 07:59.275
Like any plant, algae need
just the right amount of light.

07:59.447 --> 08:02.086
Not too much, not too little.

08:06.527 --> 08:10.600
The corals regulate that
with pigments that we can only see

08:10.767 --> 08:15.045
when they are illuminated
by ultraviolet light.

08:52.687 --> 08:54.962
Most corals, for protection,

08:55.127 --> 08:58.676
spend the day withdrawn
into their stony fortresses.

08:58.847 --> 09:04.046
Even then they are not safe
from the jaws of these butterfly fish.

09:21.087 --> 09:24.682
At night, the corals take in water,

09:24.847 --> 09:29.318
expand their tentacles
and emerge to feed.

09:45.407 --> 09:47.762
They collect plankton.

09:48.847 --> 09:54.205
Each tentacle has stinging cells,
which fire on contact.

09:54.367 --> 09:59.077
0nce the prey is caught, it's passed
down to the polyp's mouth.

10:07.847 --> 10:10.805
it is at night,
when the polyps are extended,

10:10.967 --> 10:15.324
that they add to the limestone
foundations beneath them.

10:25.287 --> 10:29.405
inevitably, the corals
begin to overgrow each other,

10:29.567 --> 10:32.286
and that means trouble.

10:38.527 --> 10:40.643
When neighbours get too close,

10:40.807 --> 10:44.516
they detect
one another's presence chemically.

10:44.687 --> 10:48.839
The aggressor on the right
prepares for battle.

10:58.487 --> 11:01.160
The polyps extrude their guts

11:01.327 --> 11:05.605
and simply
digest their rivals alive.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.759
A no-man's-land -
a band of white skeleton -

11:30.927 --> 11:35.637
is the only evidence
of the night's border dispute.

11:43.487 --> 11:48.197
Some corals are targeted
by yet more deadly predators.

11:56.647 --> 12:00.879
Predators that can crawl
in search of their victims.

12:02.167 --> 12:04.397
Crown of thorns starfish -

12:04.567 --> 12:08.196
poisonous,
invincible eating machines.

12:08.367 --> 12:14.124
They also extrude their gut
and digest coral wholesale.

12:29.767 --> 12:32.839
But some corals have help.

12:33.007 --> 12:37.239
Small crabs living within their
branches resist these onslaughts

12:37.407 --> 12:40.080
and defend their home.

12:49.607 --> 12:52.121
From beneath, they launch an attack

12:52.287 --> 12:55.757
on the vulnerable underside
of the starfish.

13:11.887 --> 13:15.038
Even the crown of thorns
will retreat

13:15.207 --> 13:18.199
from such a determined attack.

13:18.367 --> 13:21.200
This coral is left unharmed.

13:28.967 --> 13:33.757
Humphead parrotfish,
nearly a metre and a half in length.

13:33.927 --> 13:39.126
Their jaws are so powerful
they can bite through rock.

13:42.647 --> 13:47.675
When they descend to feed,
the reef itself is under threat.

13:58.767 --> 14:01.725
They are indiscriminate feeders,

14:01.887 --> 14:06.915
taking both rock and coral alike
in their quest for algae.

14:17.367 --> 14:23.283
These fish play a large part
in the erosion of the reef.

14:23.447 --> 14:27.156
The rock and coral emerges later
as a fine sand.

14:27.327 --> 14:31.923
0n a single reef, they can produce
tonnes of it every year.

14:44.767 --> 14:49.283
This soft sand
forms the tropical beaches

14:49.447 --> 14:51.677
that we find so alluring.

15:03.007 --> 15:07.159
0ver time, the sand builds up
to form an island,

15:07.327 --> 15:10.876
which is then colonised
by animals and plants.

15:18.967 --> 15:21.003
Trees take root.

15:21.167 --> 15:22.964
Birds arrive.

15:27.847 --> 15:33.956
The guano from thousands of terns
which have chosen to nest here

15:34.127 --> 15:39.201
enriches the sandy soil,
which then can support more plants.

15:41.407 --> 15:44.160
But these terns,
like other seabirds,

15:44.327 --> 15:46.397
depend on the ocean for their food.

15:56.127 --> 16:01.804
Below water, there is not only
competition for living space,

16:01.967 --> 16:06.483
but a continual contest
between predators and prey.

16:13.087 --> 16:17.877
it's the arms race between them
that over millions of years

16:18.047 --> 16:22.677
has produced today's
extraordinary diversity of form.

16:32.247 --> 16:36.240
jacks are one of the key predators
on the reef.

16:36.407 --> 16:38.841
Their weapon is speed.

16:51.487 --> 16:56.038
They seek silversides,
whose defence is to congregate

16:56.207 --> 16:59.916
in confusing shoals
of shimmering silver.

17:03.727 --> 17:09.518
The jacks deal with that by herding
the silversides onto the reef.

17:15.127 --> 17:17.766
Here, the jacks
have a better chance

17:17.926 --> 17:21.363
of separating individual fish
from the shoal.

17:34.927 --> 17:38.522
The jacks can now catch
the isolated individuals

17:38.687 --> 17:40.678
with lightning attacks.

17:54.007 --> 17:57.124
it's far safer to be hidden
on the reef itself,

17:57.287 --> 18:00.836
within the tunnels of a sponge,
for example.

18:01.007 --> 18:05.637
These tiny shrimp are no bigger
than grains of rice.

18:10.127 --> 18:12.243
These shrimps are unique.

18:12.407 --> 18:14.398
it's recently been discovered

18:14.567 --> 18:17.764
that they have
a highly-sophisticated social system,

18:17.927 --> 18:19.599
similar to that of bees.

18:19.767 --> 18:23.555
All members of the colony
are the offspring of one female.

18:23.727 --> 18:27.879
She is the queen
and the only one to produce eggs.

18:35.767 --> 18:37.564
As in a colony of bees,

18:37.727 --> 18:43.085
different individuals are
specialised for particular tasks.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.363
Some are guards and are armed

18:45.527 --> 18:48.917
with particularly
large and powerful claws.

18:53.007 --> 18:57.239
They are on watch at all times,
ready to tackle intruders.

19:08.287 --> 19:14.123
A polychaete worm. For it, a sponge
is an excellent hunting ground.

19:30.567 --> 19:36.199
in such a maze of tunnels,
attack can come at any time

19:36.367 --> 19:38.358
from any quarter.

20:05.487 --> 20:09.196
0nce the guards are alerted,
the worm loses its advantage.

20:16.527 --> 20:20.884
Better to retreat intact
than risk serious injury.

20:25.127 --> 20:28.802
The sponge not only makes
a safe home for the shrimps,

20:28.967 --> 20:33.722
it also supplies them with food,
so they never need venture outside.

20:33.887 --> 20:37.562
An establishment that provides
all their needs

20:37.727 --> 20:40.525
is clearly well worth defending.

20:41.567 --> 20:43.956
just as shrimps guard their home,

20:44.127 --> 20:47.437
other animals defend
their hunting grounds.

20:52.487 --> 20:57.641
Glassfish make tempting prey
for the redmouth grouper.

20:57.807 --> 21:01.277
its strategy is to swim
slowly amongst them

21:01.447 --> 21:04.484
till they no longer see it
as a threat.

21:15.447 --> 21:17.483
There are other fish here, too.

21:17.647 --> 21:20.639
Lionfish are ambush predators,

21:20.807 --> 21:26.165
taking their time
and watching for the right moment.

21:26.327 --> 21:30.320
But there isn't room here
for two predators.

21:38.007 --> 21:42.364
The grouper, braving the lionfish's
poisonous spines,

21:42.527 --> 21:44.518
tries to evict its rival.

22:00.807 --> 22:03.002
But lionfish are persistent.

22:03.167 --> 22:08.878
This grouper spent many hours
simply defending his hunting patch.

22:23.087 --> 22:29.003
Some animals prefer to avoid
conflict whenever possible.

22:29.167 --> 22:33.604
These harlequin shrimp,
having captured a starfish,

22:33.767 --> 22:36.156
are taking it back to a safe house

22:36.327 --> 22:39.717
beyond the reach
of competitors and danger.

22:39.887 --> 22:43.482
The problem is that starfish
have minds of their own

22:43.647 --> 22:46.480
and five large sticky arms.

22:49.727 --> 22:52.844
By the time the shrimps
have prised off one arm,

22:53.007 --> 22:55.202
another has reattached itself.

23:05.407 --> 23:09.764
0nly by manoeuvring
the starfish onto its back

23:09.927 --> 23:13.442
can they have any hope
of gaining the advantage.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.001
Even so, getting it back home

23:25.167 --> 23:27.556
is a major undertaking.

23:36.927 --> 23:40.044
The starfish
is now a living larder.

23:40.207 --> 23:45.679
if the shrimps can hang onto it,
it will feed them for days to come.

23:45.847 --> 23:48.441
The top of the reef
is usually covered

23:48.607 --> 23:52.680
by a thin layer of green algae,
another living larder.

23:52.847 --> 23:56.556
And many fish depend on it.

24:02.807 --> 24:05.241
Powder blue tangs
defend their right

24:05.407 --> 24:08.285
to graze on a particular patch.

24:08.447 --> 24:12.122
But, for a larder as well stocked
as this, there is always competition.

24:36.287 --> 24:40.724
When a shoal of convict tangs
decide to graze,

24:40.887 --> 24:42.923
little can stop them.

24:52.207 --> 24:54.960
The powder blue tangs
try to keep them off...

25:04.647 --> 25:08.640
..but they are overwhelmed
by sheer numbers.

25:14.207 --> 25:17.756
The territory is stripped of algae
in minutes.

25:33.167 --> 25:36.876
The blue tangs appear
to be fighting a losing battle.

25:41.847 --> 25:46.125
But, eventually,
they begin to get the upper hand.

26:00.287 --> 26:02.596
They persist with their attacks

26:02.767 --> 26:05.884
until the marauders
are well on their way.

26:20.247 --> 26:25.560
When night falls, some very strange
creatures creep out of crevices

26:25.727 --> 26:28.366
and crawl over the reef.

26:38.567 --> 26:42.003
This moving bush is an animal -

26:42.167 --> 26:43.759
a basket star -

26:43.927 --> 26:48.523
which spreads out its arms
to catch the night's plankton.

27:08.887 --> 27:12.766
The reef becomes
uncannily tranquil.

27:15.047 --> 27:19.040
Fish retire, hiding themselves
where they can.

28:15.727 --> 28:20.642
Marbled rays come out to hunt
for prey buried in the sand...

28:22.127 --> 28:26.996
..using electro-receptors
to scan the seabed.

28:32.207 --> 28:35.438
Their activity attracts sharks.

28:54.207 --> 28:55.879
White tips.

29:19.367 --> 29:24.043
At night, when vision is of little use,
sharks have a real advantage.

29:24.207 --> 29:30.919
They can still use both smell
and electro-reception to track fish.

29:39.007 --> 29:44.877
These sharks are also hunting
for fish concealed within the reef.

29:51.007 --> 29:52.645
Their slender shape

29:52.807 --> 29:57.278
enables them to squeeze
through surprisingly narrow gaps.

30:09.647 --> 30:11.763
There is nowhere to hide.

30:29.087 --> 30:33.717
Few animals are safe
during these feeding frenzies.

31:24.207 --> 31:29.964
Night after night, the reef animals
are subjected to these raids.

31:47.927 --> 31:50.885
But life on the reef
is not just about food,

31:51.047 --> 31:53.481
it's also about sex.

31:55.167 --> 31:58.921
There are many different
breeding strategies,

31:59.087 --> 32:04.115
but each is aimed at maximising
the number of young that will survive.

32:07.127 --> 32:11.120
Every afternoon for two months,
brown surgeonfish can be seen

32:11.287 --> 32:14.040
streaming across reefs
in the Red Sea.

32:16.127 --> 32:18.561
They all head for the same place,

32:18.727 --> 32:21.446
usually some prominent feature.

32:26.247 --> 32:30.286
Here, they wait
for the light to fade.

32:32.887 --> 32:36.277
Suddenly, females within the group

32:36.447 --> 32:39.757
make a dash away from the reef
to release their eggs.

32:39.927 --> 32:43.397
They're followed
by the quickest and closest males,

32:43.567 --> 32:47.480
all of whom are striving
to fertilise the eggs.

33:01.207 --> 33:05.723
inevitably, others come here
to feast on such easy food.

33:10.567 --> 33:12.558
As the surgeonfish spawn,

33:12.727 --> 33:17.164
fusiliers move in above
to eat the nutritious eggs.

33:35.567 --> 33:40.561
These are just the first
of many predators which will feed

33:40.727 --> 33:43.241
on the eggs and developing larvae

33:43.407 --> 33:46.444
as they drift
during the next few weeks.

33:47.807 --> 33:51.561
0ther fish are less casual
about their eggs.

33:57.047 --> 34:02.997
Banded pipefish stay close
to a small chosen area on the reef.

34:03.167 --> 34:07.001
Every morning at sunrise,
the female leaves her sleeping site

34:07.167 --> 34:09.043
and swims to find her partner.

34:13.607 --> 34:16.440
For ten minutes or so,
they remain together,

34:16.607 --> 34:21.123
reaffirming the bond that is
essential to their partnership.

34:26.847 --> 34:30.362
They swim together
around his territory

34:30.527 --> 34:32.722
in a simple greeting dance.

34:35.726 --> 34:39.514
Throughout the summer,
when the female's eggs are ripe,

34:39.687 --> 34:43.123
courtship begins in earnest
in the early morning.

34:43.286 --> 34:47.643
it takes time. After about two hours,
they rise off the seabed,

34:47.806 --> 34:50.924
entwining their two bodies.

34:56.607 --> 34:59.280
The male rubs himself
against the female,

34:59.447 --> 35:03.122
stimulating her
to release her eggs.

35:08.287 --> 35:12.121
And now, swiftly,
the male takes them.

35:17.487 --> 35:20.206
The eggs, now stuck to his belly,

35:20.367 --> 35:24.076
are patted down
to ensure that they stay there.

35:44.527 --> 35:47.200
The female then leaves him,

35:47.367 --> 35:51.724
but, every morning, returns for
a session of synchronised swimming

35:51.887 --> 35:55.800
and so ensures
that their bond is maintained.

35:57.207 --> 36:02.884
Ten days later, under the cover of
darkness, the male shakes his body

36:03.047 --> 36:06.198
and the young pipefish are born.

36:13.047 --> 36:17.563
0nly now are they
independent of their parents.

36:17.727 --> 36:23.597
Since the male takes charge
of the eggs as soon as they are laid,

36:23.767 --> 36:26.725
the female can start
producing the next batch.

36:26.887 --> 36:30.800
Without his help, the pair could
only breed every 20 days,

36:30.967 --> 36:32.559
rather than every ten.

36:32.727 --> 36:34.718
By sharing the work, they double

36:34.887 --> 36:38.596
the number of young
they can produce in any one year.

36:49.927 --> 36:52.395
A flamboyant cuttlefish.

36:55.447 --> 37:00.805
Unlike most cuttlefish, this one
spends much of its time walking,

37:00.967 --> 37:03.686
rather than jetting
across the seabed.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.838
This is a male.

37:10.687 --> 37:13.360
He is using his colourful display

37:13.527 --> 37:19.523
to try and seduce the larger female,
who seems unimpressed.

37:29.287 --> 37:31.721
Eventually, she concedes.

37:35.727 --> 37:41.324
The final event, the transfer
of sperm, is very quick.

37:46.687 --> 37:48.678
(WHALE S0NG)

38:01.367 --> 38:04.439
A singing male humpback whale.

38:15.087 --> 38:17.999
Humpbacks are only visitors
to the reef.

38:18.167 --> 38:21.557
After a pregnancy
that lasted a whole year,

38:21.727 --> 38:26.721
the females come here to give birth
and suckle their newly-born young.

38:26.887 --> 38:30.926
Their investment in their single
offspring is considerable,

38:31.087 --> 38:33.760
for each female
will continue to nurse it

38:33.927 --> 38:36.043
for a further six to 12 months.

38:36.207 --> 38:39.517
But the males are here to mate.

38:47.007 --> 38:52.604
The lone males sing to establish
their relative seniority.

38:56.727 --> 39:02.359
The louder and longer the song,
the bigger and stronger the singer.

39:34.807 --> 39:38.038
The better the song,
the larger the male,

39:38.207 --> 39:41.802
the more mating opportunities
he will get.

39:45.007 --> 39:49.444
All these different mating
strategies have the same aim -

39:49.607 --> 39:53.486
to ensure that the greatest
possible number of offspring

39:53.647 --> 39:56.639
will live long enough
to breed themselves.

40:02.127 --> 40:04.561
Corals also reproduce sexually,

40:04.727 --> 40:09.926
but being fixed to the seabed,
they can't move to find a mate.

40:10.087 --> 40:14.683
Somehow, they must synchronise
their sexual activity.

40:14.847 --> 40:18.635
They do so using the rising
water temperatures of spring

40:18.807 --> 40:20.604
and the phases of the moon.

40:32.007 --> 40:35.761
A few days after the full moon
in late spring,

40:35.927 --> 40:38.680
when tidal currents
are at their weakest,

40:38.847 --> 40:43.318
the corals of the Great Barrier Reef
are ready to spawn.

40:50.087 --> 40:55.115
Some corals are male
and release clouds of sperm.

40:55.287 --> 40:59.519
Nearby, a female
will be releasing eggs.

41:15.287 --> 41:19.565
0ther species of coral
are both male and female.

41:22.487 --> 41:26.321
These release packages of eggs

41:26.487 --> 41:29.445
already pre-wrapped in sperm.

42:21.207 --> 42:24.358
Bundles of eggs and sperm
float to the surface

42:24.527 --> 42:28.725
to mix with others
from further along the reef.

42:32.247 --> 42:36.081
Each kind of coral
times its release

42:36.247 --> 42:39.000
to a certain hour
on a certain night.

42:39.167 --> 42:43.046
That maximises the chances
for cross-fertilisation.

42:49.927 --> 42:51.724
The fertilised eggs

42:51.887 --> 42:54.526
drift away from the reef.

43:23.967 --> 43:29.087
The stormy season brings real
danger to the animals of the reef.

43:35.767 --> 43:41.046
Lobsters in the Caribbean
sense a change in the water.

43:41.207 --> 43:45.359
The temperature drops and powerful
swells disturb the sand.

43:47.727 --> 43:50.082
Under the cover of darkness,

43:50.247 --> 43:53.284
they emerge to run before the storm

43:53.447 --> 43:57.042
and risk crossing
the exposed sand flats

43:57.207 --> 44:00.165
to seek shelter in deeper water.

44:05.087 --> 44:07.920
Every year they make this journey.

44:14.807 --> 44:19.119
From all over the reef,
lobsters come to join the march.

44:19.287 --> 44:24.486
They conserve energy by travelling
in one another's slipstream.

44:32.247 --> 44:34.477
And there is the added benefit

44:34.647 --> 44:36.638
of safety in numbers.

44:49.327 --> 44:53.036
By daybreak, they've reached
the edge of the deep reef

44:53.207 --> 44:54.799
and down they go.

44:54.967 --> 44:57.401
For the rest of the stormy season,

44:57.567 --> 45:00.877
they will remain in the shelter
of deep water,

45:01.047 --> 45:02.924
out of harm's way.

45:19.687 --> 45:23.839
Sometimes, during the stormy
season, a hurricane builds.

45:24.007 --> 45:28.922
Then the very structure
of the reef itself is under threat.

46:55.767 --> 47:01.285
An entire reef can be destroyed
by just one big storm.

47:01.447 --> 47:06.441
Hundreds of years of growth
gone in a few hours.

47:22.927 --> 47:27.318
0ut in the ocean,
new life continues to develop.

47:27.487 --> 47:32.766
in time, coral larvae will return
to colonise the rubble

47:32.927 --> 47:36.806
and a new reef will grow
on the wasteland.
