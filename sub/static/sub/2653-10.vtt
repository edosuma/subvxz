WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.672
Oh, God.

00:02.737 --> 00:04.239
it's a little early, isn't it?

00:04.305 --> 00:06.148
Go back to sleep.
I don't need you awake for this.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.585
Honey, it's Christmas Eve.

00:08.642 --> 00:10.588
Are you gonna spend all day
on that thing?

00:10.644 --> 00:13.454
I made a promise. Yes!

00:13.514 --> 00:15.721
Last Christmas,
Phil got an elliptical machine...

00:15.783 --> 00:20.163
and vowed to walk the equivalent of our
house to Canada in one year.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.929
This body doesn't just happen, ladies.

00:22.990 --> 00:25.527
If he didn't make it,
no machine in the bedroom.

00:25.593 --> 00:28.665
Except for this machine
in the bedroom, ladies.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.766
Who are these ladies?

00:31.432 --> 00:33.241
Oh, Phil, give it up.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.337
Oh, you would love that, wouldn't you?

00:35.403 --> 00:37.815
Just when I'm so close
to the Canadian border...

00:37.872 --> 00:41.081
I can smell the bacon
and the reasonably priced medications.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.883
Mom, this came for you from Nana.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.945
I don't know why she bothers
to wrap it every year.

00:45.012 --> 00:46.855
It's always the same thing- slippers.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.860
You never know.
She might surprise you this year.

00:48.916 --> 00:52.329
Would you care to take a visit to the
Museum of Maternal indifference?

00:52.386 --> 00:55.196
Watch it!

00:55.256 --> 00:56.963
Oh. Careful!

00:57.024 --> 00:59.732
You guys are really
moving her downstairs right now?

00:59.794 --> 01:01.296
Aren't you gonna be late for work?

01:01.362 --> 01:03.239
They're not gonna fire an elf
on Christmas Eve.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.868
Ugh. I thought this would be lighter
without my shoes on it.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.641
You know, once you set up
your room, you could put books on this.

01:08.702 --> 01:11.512
Books... on a shoe shelf. Right.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.212
- Not gonna jump on that?
- I'm just too happy.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.255
After today, there'll be no more
clothes thrown everywhere...

01:16.310 --> 01:18.813
no more hour-long phone calls
where all she says is "No way."

01:18.879 --> 01:22.986
I think it's a little sad that
you guys are doing this today.

01:23.050 --> 01:26.623
I remember when you used to get into the
same bed on Christmas Eve...

01:26.687 --> 01:29.133
and talk about all the presents
you were gonna get.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.692
It's a perfect day for it.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.635
When I wake up in my own room
tomorrow...

01:32.693 --> 01:35.230
I'm going to be giving thanks
for my independence.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.742
And isn't that what Christmas
is all about?

01:38.699 --> 01:40.372
Seriously? Nothing?

01:41.368 --> 01:43.245
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:43.304 --> 01:45.341
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:45.406 --> 01:47.443
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:47.508 --> 01:49.419
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:49.477 --> 01:50.581
♪ Hey,♪♪

01:52.980 --> 01:55.586
This is your great-grandmother's recipe.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.526
If she could see you now-

01:57.585 --> 01:59.690
She would die again
because you're doing it wrong!

01:59.753 --> 02:02.324
My mother has been here all week.

02:02.389 --> 02:04.869
I love her very much,
but you know what they say-

02:04.925 --> 02:08.930
House guests start to stink after
three days, like dead bodies.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.400
What the hell is that?

02:12.466 --> 02:14.036
A fiber-optic tree.

02:14.101 --> 02:16.012
It's way better for the environment
than a real one.

02:16.070 --> 02:18.072
Not if the environment
is my living room.

02:18.139 --> 02:21.279
Look, I admit, it takes some getting
used to, but so did Greek yogurt.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.481
Now I can't even remember
how the old stuff tastes.

02:23.544 --> 02:26.991
Why do we keep changing things
that don't need changing?

02:27.047 --> 02:29.527
Christmas is real trees and eggnog.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.393
Perry Como and Bing on the hi-fi.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.729
- Now you're just making up words.
- I'm drawing a line in the sand.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.962
We're gonna get a real tree and cut it
down like I did when I was a kid.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.026
Follow me.

02:39.093 --> 02:41.198
- Hi, Dad.
- Can't talk. Saving Christmas.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.764
Oh.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.276
- Ay. Thank you again for coming.
- No problem.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.710
- I love babysitting.
- Good.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.611
We're going to run some quick errands.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.207
- Wait. if you're taking Joe-
- Hola, Claire.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.753
Around 4:00,
she gets fussy for her bottle.

02:54.808 --> 02:57.049
Um-

02:57.111 --> 03:00.490
Lily, do you know why I'm able to relax
and read this paper today?

03:00.548 --> 03:02.255
Because you don't have a job?

03:02.316 --> 03:04.728
I am starting
a new job in exactly-

03:04.785 --> 03:07.129
No. We're not doing this again.

03:07.188 --> 03:09.794
It's because I planned ahead.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.734
I finished
my Christmas shopping weeks ago.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.396
It's important to keep busy.

03:13.460 --> 03:16.134
I-it is perfectly normal
to take some downti-

03:16.197 --> 03:17.437
No. No.

03:17.498 --> 03:20.411
Okay. I printed out
the directions to Pepper's party.

03:20.467 --> 03:23.744
Oh. We're calling it
"The 12 Gays of Christmas" now.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.148
Just be thankful we talked him out
of "Feliz Navidude."

03:26.207 --> 03:29.848
Okay, honey, finish your breakfast so
we can go help our fellow man.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.890
One hour at this charity event, max.

03:33.147 --> 03:36.185
I can't eat.
I'm too excited to get my Puppy Pound.

03:36.250 --> 03:40.221
- I'm- I'm sorry. Your what?
- Puppy Pounds have six puppies with online profiles.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.460
Ask your parents
before using the internet.

03:42.523 --> 03:46.198
Honey, you never mentioned
a Puppy Pound. it's not on your list.

03:46.260 --> 03:49.264
Yes, it is. "Puppy Pound."

03:49.330 --> 03:51.367
Oh, no! She put a "P" backwards.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.434
And, honey, there's a "U" in "pound."

03:53.500 --> 03:55.377
- This says "guppy pond."
- Guppy pond.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.507
- Guppy pond.
- What is a guppy pond?

03:58.505 --> 04:01.281
It's only the- the coolest gift ever.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.980
I want a Puppy Pound.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.647
Um, honey, it's-

04:04.712 --> 04:06.214
Okay.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.782
I am not pointing fingers,
but our daughter...

04:07.848 --> 04:10.988
had exactly one thing on her list...

04:11.051 --> 04:13.395
and someone didn't get it...

04:13.454 --> 04:15.491
so someone needs to go to the mall.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.297
- You're pointing fingers.
- No.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.565
It's still a one.
It just fell asleep on the job.

04:20.793 --> 04:24.435
Ellipticaler's log, 1 2/24.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.409
Ten miles from Canadian border.

04:26.467 --> 04:29.038
high. strong.

04:29.103 --> 04:32.016
Must get another
application of thigh lube.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.574
Oh, good. Luke.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.247
Dad, I was with you on the tightrope.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.620
I was your wingman
in the wing-eating competition.

04:38.679 --> 04:41.387
I'm not feeling this one.
You're missing Christmas Eve.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.452
There's something more important
than Christmas, Son- pride.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.361
If I don't make it to Canada,
your mom wins...

04:46.420 --> 04:48.696
and this baby ends up in the garage
first thing in the morning.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.997
Our garage?

04:51.058 --> 04:52.799
I'm in charge of the recycling.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.932
I'm supposed to bring it from the garage to
the curb by 6:00 a. m. Thursday morning.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.101
I may have missed a few weeks.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.379
Shoot!

05:04.505 --> 05:07.111
Maybe more than a few weeks.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.915
After a while,
the pile just got so big...

05:08.976 --> 05:12.287
I couldn't bring it out the night before
or people would ask questions.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.792
I don't need people asking questions.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.521
Then you're right. You've got to finish.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.859
You'll never use this thing in the
garage. it's too drafty.

05:18.919 --> 05:22.594
That's why I'm going to Canada, buddy-
to avoid the draft.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.158
No.

05:25.059 --> 05:26.561
Eh.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.804
Bang.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.070
I know we've been hiking for an hour...

05:32.132 --> 05:34.237
but worth it when you look
at this beauty, huh?

05:34.301 --> 05:36.907
That's why you don't cut down
the first tree you see.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.972
This is literally the first tree we saw.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.541
There's our car.

05:40.607 --> 05:42.245
No, we started that way.

05:42.309 --> 05:44.289
So, you're arguing that we walked
entirely around the earth?

05:44.345 --> 05:47.849
Give me the ax.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.299
Don't give me that look.

05:54.355 --> 05:57.802
Trees are like women. The best ones make
you work a little bit harder.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.276
She's just not that into you.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.335
- I know!
- Sorry it took so long.

06:08.402 --> 06:12.407
Oh, it's fine. Claire and I were having
a nice time catching up.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.975
Ven con tu abuela.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.079
- I am really sorry that I am late.
- No, you're not.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.124
- No, I'm not.
- Mm-hmm. it's fine.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.920
Just hope I didn't talk Pilar's ear off.

06:20.981 --> 06:26.863
No! I love hearing about your family
and your big new job.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.127
Oh, well, it-it's not such a big job.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.135
I mean, I'm really
just working for my dad.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.603
But you're working hard.
I'm proud of you.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.231
- How do they look?
- Ooh! Perfect.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.640
- Yes.
- You are a wonderful student.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.838
- Thank you.
- My grandmother taught my mother.

06:40.901 --> 06:45.008
My mother taught me,
and now I teach Claire.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.676
And don't be so modest.

06:46.740 --> 06:50.654
I respect a woman who can raise a family
and have a full-time job.

06:50.711 --> 06:54.386
Can you believe that on Fridays they
don't even have to dress up?

06:54.448 --> 06:55.825
- Taste. Taste. Taste.
- Oh.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.829
Sometimes they even wear sweatpants.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.762
Would you like to lick the batter?

06:59.820 --> 07:01.663
- Yes! Oh, yes!
- You like that?

07:01.722 --> 07:03.429
- Me too. There's one for-
- No, no, no!

07:03.490 --> 07:05.436
- Helpers only.
- Uh-huh.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.335
I don't make the rules.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.205
Oh, Lily, what a beautiful ornament.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.373
That's gonna make
a little kid very happy.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.212
Wait. I don't get to keep this?

07:18.272 --> 07:19.808
Why am I killing myself?

07:19.873 --> 07:21.375
Okay, kids!

07:21.442 --> 07:24.855
We've got a visitor from the North Pole,
and he brought presents.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.649
Hey! Hey, how's it going?

07:28.715 --> 07:30.319
There are no Puppy Pounds anywhere.

07:30.384 --> 07:33.854
It's like trying to find a Cabbage Patch
Kid on Christmas Eve, 1983.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.093
Still hurts, huh?

07:35.155 --> 07:36.566
I had her bed all made.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.603
Okay. Well, Lily is gonna be devastated.

07:38.659 --> 07:41.503
Call around. Get us on some lists.
You have to do something.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.940
I'll figure it out.
How's the fund-raiser?

07:43.997 --> 07:46.739
Oh, well, I'm managing. You know.
Oh, bring the checkbook.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.802
You can always tell when they're
gearing up for the big ask-

07:48.869 --> 07:51.179
They fill you full of freebies.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.184
Oh, hey, I gotta go.
Gotta help somebody.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.085
Hi. Classic. Flawlessly executed.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.283
- If I had one-
- Just trying to bring a smile to you folks.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.587
- You're gonna get through this.
- Get through what?

08:01.648 --> 08:04.629
Don't be embarrassed.
Everyone here is in the same boat.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.096
We are?

08:06.153 --> 08:09.100
Best thing about the hot chocolate-
They let us keep the mug.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.503
I thought it was
a charity event for the needy.

08:18.565 --> 08:21.239
Turns out,
it was a charity event for the needy.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.541
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.947
- Look! Santa gave me a Puppy Pound.
- What? No.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.643
I'm finally happy.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.584
I'd like a picture for the newsletter.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.384
- You can show your mommy.
- I don't have a mommy.

08:31.445 --> 08:33.288
This is why I do this.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.025
That cramp could be a heart attack.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.792
Here's some advice
I've been holding back on.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.890
Always shave with the grain.

08:41.955 --> 08:46.267
- No reputable talent agent will ever ask for money up front.
- Dad, you're fine.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.397
- I really want to quit, Luke.
- No, you're gonna make it.

08:48.462 --> 08:50.135
He was never gonna make it.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.904
I just needed to buy some time.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.736
That's a lot of product you're moving.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.678
Just bring it to a recycling place.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.307
Not until I get paid.

08:58.372 --> 09:02.013
Just so you know,
this is six weeks' allowance.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.952
You have the coolest parents ever.

09:04.011 --> 09:07.322
I want to know when you're about to
leave, so give me a honk.

09:07.381 --> 09:08.883
Honk!

09:08.949 --> 09:11.156
From your car.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.926
The best business card
is a firm handshake.

09:13.987 --> 09:17.594
The best pickup line
is a tight pair of Dockers.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.501
- The best Dockers-
- Dad, save your breath.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.938
- You're in the last five miles.
- I'm never gonna make it!

09:21.995 --> 09:23.633
Of course you are.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.540
Then again,
do what you want. I got stuff to do.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.101
- I'm gonna quit.
- Cool.

09:27.167 --> 09:30.205
What's one more failure?

09:30.270 --> 09:32.716
You ever wonder why
we take such a crazy route to school?

09:34.675 --> 09:37.485
So I don't have to drive
by certain places-

09:37.544 --> 09:40.218
the flute teacher's house
I went to once...

09:40.280 --> 09:43.693
the French cooking academy I quit after
learning only two of the five mother sauces...

09:44.851 --> 09:49.300
the hot yoga studio
I left after happy baby.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.633
I guess there's no avoiding
this big failure sitting in my garage.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.730
- Get up.
- I appreciate it, buddy, but-

09:56.797 --> 09:58.299
Get up.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.039
I don't know anything about flutes...

10:01.101 --> 10:04.139
or cooking or happy babies...

10:04.204 --> 10:07.310
but I'm damn sure
getting my dad to Canada.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.115
Now mount that beast.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.814
Thank you, Son.

10:10.877 --> 10:14.188
You can thank me after you cross the
finish line and the celebration begins.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.693
Just picture that.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.252
I'm picturing it.

10:20.087 --> 10:23.159
I'm picturing it.
I'm really picturing it!

10:25.559 --> 10:27.835
- Thanks, Santa.
- Yeah. You got it.

10:27.894 --> 10:30.101
Don't forget a candy cane
from Mrs. Claus.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.040
I gotta take a break.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.942
What?

10:35.435 --> 10:37.915
Um- it's okay. Does anybody want to
take a picture with me?

10:37.971 --> 10:41.214
- I'll do it.
- Oh, maybe just the kids.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.983
- What was that?
- What was what?

10:44.044 --> 10:45.682
Santa doesn't take breaks.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.487
He visits the North Pole.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.788
And why do you
leave your things all over?

10:49.850 --> 10:51.352
Who do you think cleans this place up?

10:51.418 --> 10:53.193
Oh, you are such a nag!

10:53.253 --> 10:56.063
Can't we at least act
like a happy couple during the holidays?

10:56.123 --> 10:57.693
For the children!

10:57.758 --> 10:59.533
Another hot chocolate?

10:59.593 --> 11:01.595
How many more of those
are you going to drink?

11:01.662 --> 11:03.232
At least it's warm, unlike you!

11:03.296 --> 11:05.333
He travels a lot.

11:05.399 --> 11:07.936
She's put on cookie weight. it's hard.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.508
Yes, you can put me on
the last-minute shoppers waiting list.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.073
- Unbelievable.
- Oh! Well, there he is.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.642
- Hey, Jotham.
- Hey.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.552
Oh, looks like someone did a little
last-minute Christmas shopping.

11:17.611 --> 11:19.113
That Daniel's a lucky guy.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.557
Yes, he is,
but these are for Pepper's party.

11:21.615 --> 11:23.595
His invitation said "No gifts, please."

11:23.650 --> 11:25.652
Say that again... as Pepper.

11:25.719 --> 11:28.598
- No gifts?
- Please.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.157
5:00, Christmas Eve...

11:30.223 --> 11:32.499
and I have to find
a dozen perfect presents...

11:32.559 --> 11:35.506
for the world's snarkiest, cattiest men-

11:35.562 --> 11:37.508
my dear, dear friends.

11:37.564 --> 11:40.238
Pull! Pull! Pull!

11:40.300 --> 11:42.837
- Yeah. Hey, take a break.
- This is taking forever.

11:42.903 --> 11:46.715
It's supposed to.
Took my dad and I all day to get a tree.

11:46.773 --> 11:48.753
And when he finally brought her down...

11:48.809 --> 11:51.016
he used to celebrate with a cigar.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.149
I was just a kid,
so I'd have a cigarette.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.591
All right, grab the other end.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.163
There we go. Now we got a groove.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.665
- Yeah.
- There we-

12:01.722 --> 12:03.963
- It won't budge!
- What the hell is this wood made of?

12:04.024 --> 12:05.526
They ought to make saws out of it.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.265
Let's face it. The tree's beaten us.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.273
Hey, we're Pritchetts. We don't quit.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.866
Besides, all my tools are stuck in it.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.645
I got it.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.672
It's simple physics.

12:17.738 --> 12:20.810
A little pressure, the thing will snap
where we put the blade in. Done.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.150
Just hit the gas.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.656
It's working.
That's why they call it Yankee ingen-

12:25.712 --> 12:27.214
Get down!

12:28.749 --> 12:31.753
- It's bald on one side now.
- It'll be fine.

12:31.818 --> 12:34.094
We'll just comb over some branches.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.900
Oh, Claire, I thought that you had left.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.565
She was going to, but I wanted to show
her how much better she looks...

12:41.628 --> 12:44.006
- without this hair blocking her pretty face.
- Mmm.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.907
She does have beautiful hair though.

12:45.966 --> 12:49.106
Ay. sí. Porque escogió un colorbonito en
el salón de belleza será. ¿Por qué más?

12:49.169 --> 12:52.013
- What did she say?
- That you picked a good color.

12:52.072 --> 12:55.076
At least, I think that's what she said
with that American accent.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.588
You don't have to entertain her.

12:57.644 --> 13:00.181
After all, she's my mother.

13:00.247 --> 13:04.059
Ah, this used to be Glorita's favorite.

13:04.117 --> 13:08.327
She used to do headstands to get extra
cookies- at least, she'd try.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.390
Yeah, but it's not easy.

13:10.457 --> 13:13.563
I mean, it's hard enough
to keep all this right-side up.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.403
Imagine when I had to
put it all right-side down. it was-

13:16.463 --> 13:18.500
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe I can still do it.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.977
- Look at that. Oh, wow.
- Look at Claire, Gloria!

13:21.034 --> 13:24.072
Very good. Two cookies for you.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.377
Thank you!

13:25.438 --> 13:27.975
Yeah,
but she needs a pedicure. Look at that.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.543
Oh! You knocked me down.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.680
- I did not.
- Yes, you did too!

13:31.745 --> 13:33.622
Girls!

13:33.680 --> 13:35.990
Girls! Girls! Girls!

13:36.049 --> 13:39.030
No need to fight.
I don't have a favorite.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.962
Why the hell not?

13:45.125 --> 13:48.868
I am very disappointed in both of you.

13:48.929 --> 13:52.433
Family members should treat each other
with love and respect.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.604
Except that Claire is
not part of our family.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.978
- Cierra la boca.
- No. No, no.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.812
She's right,
unless that's what you just said.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.978
I can't tell, 'cause I-I only took
French, and je parle un peu

14:02.042 --> 14:05.114
- Oh, you have a beautiful accent.
- Really? Do you think so?

14:05.178 --> 14:07.886
- ¡Ay. ya, por favor!
- I'm sorry. I-

14:08.682 --> 14:12.755
I- I'm jealous.

14:12.819 --> 14:18.269
Ay. Claire. But you're beautiful too,
in your own way.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.828
No. I'm not jealous of you.

14:20.894 --> 14:24.239
I'm jealous of how your mother comes all
the way to see you from Colombia...

14:24.297 --> 14:26.903
when my own mother
won't even get on a bus...

14:26.967 --> 14:29.004
from the almond co-op
she lives on three hours away.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.480
She sends presents, no?

14:30.537 --> 14:33.643
Yeah. The same thing every year.
It's always slippers.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.812
- I am sorry.
- Thank you.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.720
But I shouldn't take it out on you
just 'cause I have a lousy mom.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.917
Don't disrespect your mother!

14:40.981 --> 14:42.619
- Is she always like this?
- Yes.

14:42.682 --> 14:48.030
Did you ever think maybe there's a
reason she sends you that gift?

14:48.088 --> 14:51.001
Yeah, 'cause she found something when I was
eight years old that I actually liked...

14:51.057 --> 14:52.798
and she hasn't thought about it since.

14:52.859 --> 14:55.897
Well, maybe she thinks about it a lot.

14:55.962 --> 15:00.570
Maybe she remembers a time
when she made you happy...

15:00.634 --> 15:02.978
and she wants to go back there.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.277
Well, now I feel terrible.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.511
The only thing I sent her was an e-card.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.487
We don't like to admit it...

15:11.945 --> 15:16.189
but mothers never get over
the day their daughters leave them.

15:17.217 --> 15:20.391
We never stop needing our little girls.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.500
I will never stop needing you, Mama.

15:29.863 --> 15:31.365
Mmm.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.677
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.407
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.915
Excuse me, elf.
It's been 45 minutes. Where's Santa?

15:38.972 --> 15:40.508
I don't know.

15:40.573 --> 15:44.487
Maybe he's a little busy making presents
for every child in the world.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.717
One second.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.556
Hey. You're just gonna leave?

15:49.616 --> 15:53.359
- Where is he?
- He said he was going out for a pack of candy canes.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.366
- You mean like those?
- Santa! Santa! Santa! Santa!

15:55.422 --> 15:57.265
Okay. Wake up!

15:57.324 --> 16:00.271
He is not coming back. Okay.

16:00.327 --> 16:03.069
We need to change
into our regular clothes and sneak out.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.268
Who am I kidding?
My eyes are unforgettable.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.642
I couldn't even
hold on to a fake husband.

16:07.701 --> 16:10.341
I always thought you were the tough one
to live with, but maybe I am.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.212
Okay, they've breached
the jelly bean moat.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.774
- This is a problem.
- It's a big problem.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.184
All this time I've been waiting for a
guy to see the true me...

16:16.242 --> 16:17.744
and now I'm scared he will.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.018
- My God, they've got Blitzen!
- What's going to happen to me?

16:20.080 --> 16:22.617
Am I just going to nitpick everyone
until they leave me?

16:22.682 --> 16:25.060
- Hey, Mom found somebody.
- That's true.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.792
Okay, listen.
We really need to get out of here.

16:27.854 --> 16:31.165
But I just want to let you know that you
weren't all bad to live with. I thought-

16:31.224 --> 16:32.828
Oh, my God!

16:32.892 --> 16:35.463
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

16:35.528 --> 16:38.737
Where's Santa?

16:38.798 --> 16:40.903
Only a hundred more yards.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.640
You're just about there.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.204
Can you see it?

16:44.270 --> 16:45.806
It's so beautiful.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.408
It's so green.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.920
- And, wow, those are high up there.
- The mountains?

16:49.976 --> 16:52.547
No, my shorts again.
Would you mind giving them one last tug?

16:52.612 --> 16:53.989
You're crossing the border.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.357
I know, and I feel bad asking,
but I'm tasting cotton.

16:56.416 --> 16:59.260
No. You did it. You're in Canada.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.094
Wait. What?

17:01.154 --> 17:04.829
I did it? I did it!

17:04.891 --> 17:06.426
I did it. I did it!

17:06.492 --> 17:09.098
Let's go tell Mom.

17:10.463 --> 17:13.171
Wait. How did I used to walk?

17:13.233 --> 17:14.940
All right. Come on, sweetie.

17:15.001 --> 17:17.607
Let's go.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.784
- Uh, we're serving Christmas dinner.
- Uh, no. That's fine.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.513
We have to actually get going, so-

17:23.576 --> 17:25.920
- But I haven't eaten today.
- Oh, you poor thing.

17:25.979 --> 17:27.481
No, she's fine. She's fine.

17:29.315 --> 17:31.090
There he is.
Honey, where did you get this coat?

17:31.151 --> 17:34.758
Sorry, kids. it looks like we've run out
of coats and toys.

17:34.821 --> 17:37.461
That's okay, Mom.

17:37.524 --> 17:39.026
At least I got to see presents.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.867
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.565
Hey! How are my do-gooders?

17:42.629 --> 17:44.472
- Did you have fun?
- Yep. Talk about it in the car.

17:44.531 --> 17:45.703
Oh, my gosh.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.210
Wow!

17:47.267 --> 17:49.804
- What are these?
- Yeah, I went a little crazy, huh?

17:49.869 --> 17:51.610
No. No, no. it's a Christmas miracle.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.311
Kids! Kids! Who wants presents?

17:54.374 --> 17:57.446
- Cam, what are you doing?
- No, trust me. Lily has enough.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.547
- Cam. Cam.
- Everybody, merry Christmas!

17:59.612 --> 18:01.319
- Ho, ho, ho!
- Hey, Cam.

18:01.381 --> 18:04.624
- Not that one.
- ¡Feliz Navidad!

18:04.684 --> 18:06.163
Okay. Those aren't for Lily.

18:06.219 --> 18:09.325
- "His-and-his shower clogs"?
- They're for Pepper's party.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.562
- He said, "No gifts, please."
- imagine how Pepper would say that.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.195
What's a Himalayan salt plate?

18:14.260 --> 18:16.206
You can season your food
while you serve it.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.299
- Yeah.
- "Body fat scale"?

18:18.364 --> 18:20.867
I wish I would've had one of those when
I was your age. You're welcome.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.675
Who's Robert Mapplethorpe?

18:22.735 --> 18:25.045
Actually, I'm gonna need
that one back. Sorry.

18:25.105 --> 18:28.814
That's okay. All I really wanted this
year was a Puppy Pound.

18:28.875 --> 18:32.448
Here.
You can have mine. it's really fun.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.924
Oh, my gosh. That's the sweetest thing
I've ever seen.

18:34.981 --> 18:37.825
Lily, honey, that was so nice.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.921
It's okay. I'll get one tomorrow.

18:39.986 --> 18:43.695
- Um, well, you know what? About that-
- Cam? Cam?

18:43.756 --> 18:47.169
Uh, that was the T-O-Y S-T-O-R-E.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.070
- What?
- Someone returned their Puppy Pound.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.575
We can't get over there in time
before the store closes.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.611
Wait, you know
who lives right over there?

18:55.235 --> 18:58.978
Oh, no. No!

19:06.779 --> 19:09.259
Almost there.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.192
No.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.663
No! Why?

19:13.720 --> 19:16.633
Why?

19:20.293 --> 19:22.796
In hindsight, the cigar was a mistake.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.138
So what do we do now?

19:25.198 --> 19:27.542
- We go home.
- I thought Pritchetts never give up.

19:27.600 --> 19:31.104
They know when to give up,
which is its own kind of victory.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.151
- Unless-
- What?

19:33.206 --> 19:34.879
No.
it's crazy.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.751
- Unless-
- Are you really gonna make me ask you again?

19:37.810 --> 19:41.314
We somehow apply pressure to the axhead
already in the tree.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.486
- I bet we can use the jack from the car.
- Of course.

19:43.550 --> 19:46.429
- The upward motion will split the trunk.
- Yeah.

19:51.991 --> 19:55.768
- We can always tell people that's how we did it.
- That is how we did it.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.400
People love getting new things...

19:59.465 --> 20:01.604
but the best stuff
has a story behind it.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.170
Damn fine tree.

20:03.236 --> 20:04.806
Except the saw's
still stuck in the trunk.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.750
Yeah, you're gonna want to keep your
brother away from that, huh?

20:07.807 --> 20:10.947
A lot of times,
it's only after we get rid of something-

20:11.010 --> 20:12.353
Room for me?

20:12.412 --> 20:15.018
That we realize how much we miss it.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.092
- Aw.
- That is cute!

20:19.152 --> 20:22.031
Nice. Good job, Luke.

20:22.088 --> 20:24.090
Yea! A Puppy Pound!

20:26.192 --> 20:27.933
And things that seem worthless...

20:27.994 --> 20:30.668
suddenly turn out to be super valuable-

20:30.730 --> 20:32.539
Okay, everybody,
picture in front of the tree.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.044
Timer's set. Ready?

20:34.100 --> 20:36.603
No, no. Another one.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.444
Oh, no!

20:38.504 --> 20:40.006
What? No!

20:40.073 --> 20:41.814
Maybe even precious.

20:41.874 --> 20:45.117
Which is why I thought getting rid of
this stuff would be a huge mistake.

20:45.178 --> 20:46.885
- Ah.
- Nice try.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.688
- You still owe us six weeks' allowance.
- And the fireworks.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.820
How could you screw this up?

20:51.884 --> 20:53.386
What?

20:58.024 --> 21:00.470
I'll see you in Vancouver, eh?

21:00.526 --> 21:02.130
No.
Luke, do the accent again?

21:02.195 --> 21:03.503
Oh, are you on that machine?

21:03.563 --> 21:05.600
Yes, Juliana, but unlike your husband...

21:05.665 --> 21:07.838
I'll be finished before you know it.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.278
- You know what? It's actually easier this way!
- Hmm.

21:10.336 --> 21:11.940
Wonder if you can patent a movement?

21:12.005 --> 21:15.214
Call it Philiptical-

21:22.882 --> 21:25.522
Dad, trick-or-treaters.
We're out of candy!

21:25.585 --> 21:27.087
Who is this Dad?

21:27.153 --> 21:29.292
I'm Gandalf!

21:29.355 --> 21:30.993
Huzzah!
