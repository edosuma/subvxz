00:09.946 --> 00:11.434
- Found that the constant

00:11.434 --> 00:14.026
desire to do better comes
from a simple place.

00:14.026 --> 00:15.635
I truly believe that's the interest

00:15.635 --> 00:17.384
in the human condition that keeps

00:17.384 --> 00:19.919
bringing us back to this need to improve.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.537
- Thanks, you guys around?
- See you soon.

01:33.537 --> 01:34.870
- See you, cool.

01:38.633 --> 01:41.222
- Yo, these speakers are
all staticky and shit again.

01:41.222 --> 01:42.199
Can you fix it?

01:42.199 --> 01:43.616
- Yeah, I'll try.

01:49.367 --> 01:50.505
- How do you always do that?

01:50.505 --> 01:52.503
- Yeah, well, you know, it's
just an electrical failure.

01:52.503 --> 01:54.510
Too much power applied to the subwoofers-

01:54.510 --> 01:55.343
- All right, all right, all right.

01:55.343 --> 01:56.510
Sorry I asked.

01:57.660 --> 02:01.601
- Let's give a
round of applause for Venus.

02:23.573 --> 02:25.050
- Jesus Christ.

02:25.050 --> 02:26.000
- DC, what's up?

02:26.000 --> 02:26.833
Why aren't you working the floor?

02:26.833 --> 02:27.666
- Fuck this, man.

02:27.666 --> 02:28.782
I made no money up there tonight.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.327
You got these people, they're screaming,

02:30.327 --> 02:31.479
they're shouting your name, they're

02:31.479 --> 02:32.312
trying to get in your face-

02:32.312 --> 02:33.145
- I get it, I get it, man.

02:33.145 --> 02:35.233
VIP, though, that's where the money is.

02:35.233 --> 02:37.422
Just keep your head down, work the floor,

02:37.422 --> 02:39.575
and let them come to you.

02:39.575 --> 02:41.352
- Whatever, man, I'm...

02:41.352 --> 02:42.451
I'm hot.

02:42.451 --> 02:44.308
Look, senior year, I was voted

02:44.308 --> 02:46.794
most likely to bang a celebrity.

02:46.794 --> 02:49.544
I'm not gonna be their slave boy.

02:53.243 --> 02:56.651
I'm sorry, it just, it really
sucks being the new guy.

02:56.651 --> 02:58.100
- All right, man, I get it.

02:58.100 --> 03:00.373
But you won't always be.

03:00.373 --> 03:05.124
These people, they come here
looking for refuge or escape.

03:05.124 --> 03:07.842
No one's gonna wanna get a
lap dance from an asshole.

03:08.710 --> 03:09.543
Get it?

03:09.543 --> 03:10.376
- Yeah.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.508
Sorry.
- Cool.

03:26.777 --> 03:27.860
- Big tipper.

03:31.161 --> 03:31.994
- We got 'em?

03:31.994 --> 03:32.827
- Yeah.

03:50.777 --> 03:52.554
- I'm sorry, I didn't even get your name.

03:52.554 --> 03:53.387
- Angel.

03:55.229 --> 03:56.567
- I'm Michelle.

03:56.567 --> 03:57.817
- Hi, Michelle.

03:58.702 --> 04:00.909
- So, do I just sit here?

04:00.909 --> 04:02.967
- Or you can move around, you know?

04:02.967 --> 04:04.077
Whatever you want.

04:04.077 --> 04:08.244
- I don't know, I don't know
what to talk to you about.

04:09.531 --> 04:12.899
I don't really know what I'm doing here.

04:12.899 --> 04:14.607
This is so lame, okay?

04:14.607 --> 04:15.440
This is...

04:16.322 --> 04:18.154
I am so not this girl.

04:19.024 --> 04:21.769
I never do this, right?

04:21.769 --> 04:23.985
Honestly, I was walking by this place

04:23.985 --> 04:27.619
and I thought, "What
if I can be this girl?

04:27.619 --> 04:30.394
"Just for a night, what if I...

04:30.394 --> 04:34.311
"What if I just tried it
on and see if it fit?"

04:38.591 --> 04:39.758
- Does it fit?

04:45.495 --> 04:46.524
- I don't...

04:46.524 --> 04:47.607
I don't know.

04:51.027 --> 04:54.027
- You don't have to know everything.

04:54.898 --> 04:55.731
- Really?

04:57.006 --> 04:58.589
I hope that's true.

05:06.612 --> 05:08.675
Do you like Fruity O's?

05:08.675 --> 05:09.758
- The cereal?

05:10.960 --> 05:12.377
Yeah, I guess so.

05:13.776 --> 05:15.484
- They're my favorite.

05:15.484 --> 05:17.104
I never buy them.

05:17.104 --> 05:18.360
- Why not?

05:18.360 --> 05:20.476
- My husband has high cholesterol.

05:20.476 --> 05:22.470
He never lets me get them.

05:22.470 --> 05:24.718
I wasn't gonna tell you
that I had a husband.

05:24.718 --> 05:26.870
- It's okay.

05:26.870 --> 05:28.168
You can have a husband.

05:28.168 --> 05:33.080
- You don't think it's wrong,
being married, coming here?

05:33.080 --> 05:34.330
I'm a mom, too.

05:35.985 --> 05:39.568
- I think you seem like
a very nice person.

05:44.569 --> 05:47.345
- Why'd you start dancing?

05:47.345 --> 05:49.540
- You don't have to feel bad for me.

05:49.540 --> 05:50.850
- No, I wasn't.
- That's okay.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.185
- I wasn't, and...

05:52.185 --> 05:55.382
- People ask me these
questions almost every night.

05:55.382 --> 05:56.651
It's always the same look in their eyes,

05:56.651 --> 05:58.868
but, you know, they don't know that

05:58.868 --> 06:01.401
I actually wanna be here.

06:01.401 --> 06:03.901
I get to meet people like you.

06:05.375 --> 06:07.375
I won't be here forever.

06:08.321 --> 06:09.904
- What will you do?

06:12.772 --> 06:14.022
- I don't know.

06:15.516 --> 06:18.053
Maybe I'll be a therapist.

06:18.053 --> 06:20.250
Therapy tends to get a bit of a stigma.

06:20.250 --> 06:24.094
- Well, you're
cheaper than most therapists.

06:24.094 --> 06:26.699
At least, the ones I've been to.

06:26.699 --> 06:28.906
They're a waste of money, anyway.

06:28.906 --> 06:30.456
You just go there, and you keep talking

06:30.456 --> 06:32.770
about the same thing, like,

06:32.770 --> 06:34.355
I'm not a good enough wife, or

06:34.355 --> 06:37.605
good enough mother, daughter, whatever.

06:38.963 --> 06:42.046
What you actually wanna be saying is,

06:44.104 --> 06:46.069
is my husband married me when I was

06:46.069 --> 06:48.139
the best version of myself, because

06:48.139 --> 06:49.574
you're always the best version of yourself

06:49.574 --> 06:53.047
when you're falling in love, right?

06:53.047 --> 06:54.380
But now I think,

06:56.751 --> 06:58.588
I think I was just pretending.

06:58.588 --> 07:02.003
It was fake, and now I'm just...

07:02.003 --> 07:02.920
I'm pissed,

07:05.646 --> 07:08.713
because he married this other person,

07:08.713 --> 07:10.947
and now I have to stay that person,

07:10.947 --> 07:12.983
so I try to think to myself, "this will

07:12.983 --> 07:14.203
"never be different, maybe I'll

07:14.203 --> 07:15.960
"always have to pretend to be this person

07:15.960 --> 07:17.507
"forever, and that's fine.

07:17.507 --> 07:19.809
"That's okay, that's
just the way it'll be."

07:19.809 --> 07:22.575
Just be pretending to
be this woman, the woman

07:22.575 --> 07:25.658
that I was when I first fell in love.

07:29.404 --> 07:31.654
How do you stop pretending?

07:34.463 --> 07:37.760
- I guess you just start
with something simple,

07:37.760 --> 07:41.562
something that you don't think matters,

07:41.562 --> 07:43.229
that's just for you.

07:44.129 --> 07:47.212
Like buying yourself some Fruity O's.

07:57.406 --> 07:59.039
You want more time?

07:59.039 --> 08:00.147
- It's okay.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.647
I won't charge you, I promise.

08:04.037 --> 08:05.037
- Thank you.

08:10.497 --> 08:11.330
Can I...

08:18.633 --> 08:19.966
Can I touch you?

08:38.499 --> 08:39.582
- Joel, Alex.

08:41.138 --> 08:42.056
What's up?

08:42.056 --> 08:42.889
- Are you kidding?

08:42.889 --> 08:43.793
- No, come on.

08:43.793 --> 08:46.717
- This guy won't even take Viagra.

08:46.717 --> 08:48.796
- Not the real thing.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.533
Night, fellas.

08:50.533 --> 08:51.869
- Bye.

08:51.869 --> 08:54.952
- Come on, Wonder Woman, are you sure?

08:54.952 --> 08:57.702
- I'm already packed.
- Seriously?

09:07.599 --> 09:08.432
- That those who believe

09:08.432 --> 09:10.495
themselves to be honest are over 85%

09:10.495 --> 09:13.070
more likely to also label
themselves as satisfied.

09:14.257 --> 09:16.095
So, it's really better to be honest

09:16.095 --> 09:18.428
than it is to be impressive.

09:43.371 --> 09:44.204
- Hey.

09:46.285 --> 09:47.213
You work here?

09:47.213 --> 09:48.046
- Yeah.

09:49.814 --> 09:50.647
- Brian.

09:51.980 --> 09:52.813
- Angel.

09:57.182 --> 10:01.255
- What happens in those rooms back there?

10:01.255 --> 10:05.422
- Nothing too crazy, but it's
definitely a lot more private.

10:08.204 --> 10:12.371
- I'm so sick of all these calls
for unity and togetherness.

10:14.513 --> 10:16.191
The main reason this country's turned

10:16.191 --> 10:18.569
to a whole bunch of pussies who can't

10:18.569 --> 10:21.152
handle any adversity is because

10:22.290 --> 10:24.886
everybody just runs over to console people

10:24.886 --> 10:28.469
as soon as some shit
gets shitty, you know?

10:29.477 --> 10:33.816
As if you could protect people
from goddamn daily life,

10:33.816 --> 10:35.899
you know what I'm saying?

10:40.725 --> 10:44.725
- No, no, no it's really
not that kind of party.

10:46.585 --> 10:47.668
- Gosh, okay.

10:48.680 --> 10:49.513
Well,

10:50.749 --> 10:51.582
how about

10:56.090 --> 10:56.923
this?

10:59.405 --> 11:02.430
Can it be this kind of party?

11:02.430 --> 11:04.097
- Yeah, that's fine.

11:13.251 --> 11:14.168
No, thanks.

11:15.458 --> 11:17.958
- One of those good guys, huh?

11:25.760 --> 11:27.760
I just do it when I'm...

11:29.147 --> 11:30.225
Whew.

11:30.225 --> 11:31.725
When I'm drinking.

11:33.428 --> 11:34.991
Although it really helps before a meeting,

11:34.991 --> 11:36.901
before I got to pull a sale.

11:36.901 --> 11:38.505
My wife, just drives her nuts,

11:38.505 --> 11:39.615
you know what I'm saying?

11:39.615 --> 11:41.840
She's always telling me,
"You don't need that stuff,

11:41.840 --> 11:44.018
"just be confident, be yourself,

11:44.018 --> 11:46.088
"and it'll all work out,"
but who is that, hm?

11:46.088 --> 11:48.326
I don't know who that is, do you?

11:48.326 --> 11:49.811
Is there some cool, confident version

11:49.811 --> 11:51.979
of myself that I don't know about?

11:51.979 --> 11:54.113
I'm a different guy with everyone I meet.

11:54.113 --> 11:56.062
I think that's true about most people.

11:56.062 --> 11:57.418
I'm not special, there's not some

11:57.418 --> 11:59.976
version locked up inside who's gonna be

11:59.976 --> 12:01.842
miraculously unleashed the moment

12:01.842 --> 12:03.909
I decide to start being my fucking self,

12:03.909 --> 12:04.918
you know what I'm saying?

12:04.918 --> 12:05.751
Fuck her.

12:07.391 --> 12:08.872
But I love her.

12:08.872 --> 12:09.705
I just...

12:13.891 --> 12:15.141
It's just hard.

12:16.577 --> 12:18.327
- Does she know that?

12:19.201 --> 12:21.701
- I don't know what she knows.

12:28.828 --> 12:31.252
- Well, you know, you aren't being

12:31.252 --> 12:33.252
totally honest with her.

12:34.227 --> 12:37.152
Better to be honest than impressive.

12:37.152 --> 12:40.735
- Fuck that shit.

12:44.891 --> 12:45.724
- Come on.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.416
You just got to suck it up.

12:52.935 --> 12:54.423
- Touche.

12:54.423 --> 12:55.840
You got me there.

13:08.960 --> 13:09.793
Hey.

13:23.022 --> 13:24.355
Can I touch you?

13:33.527 --> 13:35.932
- You hear we got new speakers?

13:35.932 --> 13:36.989
Yeah, we finally got rid of those

13:36.989 --> 13:39.786
piece of shitters you're
always having to fix.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.012
I almost had to throw down.

13:41.012 --> 13:42.251
Management was like, "No," and I was like,

13:42.251 --> 13:44.366
"Bitch, there are just
some things you can't fix."

13:44.366 --> 13:46.113
- So, you just tossed them?

13:46.113 --> 13:47.781
- Yeah, I was just
tired of asking you all-

13:47.781 --> 13:49.637
- But dude, I fixed those.

13:49.637 --> 13:52.353
You can't just toss something
because it doesn't work.

13:52.353 --> 13:56.353
- Dude, don't give me
that therapist shit again.
