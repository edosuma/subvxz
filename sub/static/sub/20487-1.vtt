- And they did.
- Yes.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.563
- And what happened?
- Well, first of all,

were picked up one day

06:39.633 --> 06:42.469

and families were torn apart,

ironic thing about it

06:44.972 --> 06:46.305
and the most tragic thing

06:46.306 --> 06:47.907

of years they said,

12:40.293 --> 12:41.928
if you grew up in California

12:41.929 --> 12:45.597
with a Mexican name
and of Mexican heritage?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.099
Al Madrigal is a comedian.

12:47.100 --> 12:51.838
Gustavo Arellano is the editor
of "OC Weekly."

12:51.839 --> 12:53.605
We discussed
such weighty matters

12:53.606 --> 12:56.843
over taquitos at Cielito Lindo
on Olvera Street,

12:56.844 --> 12:58.344
which has been serving
the kind of stuff

12:58.345 --> 13:01.047
that made Americans
fall in love with Mexican food

13:01.048 --> 13:02.982
since the 1930s.

13:02.983 --> 13:06.152
♪

13:06.153 --> 13:07.619
Beans with machaca,

13:07.620 --> 13:10.189
spicy shredded beef,
sauce and cheese,

13:10.190 --> 13:14.861
I believe they call
these things a burrito.

13:14.862 --> 13:19.832
But what they're known
for here is their taquitos.

13:19.833 --> 13:24.203
Rolled up, fried,
smothered in avocado sauce,

13:24.204 --> 13:25.571
topped with chile guero,

13:25.572 --> 13:28.808
garlic, tomatillo and cilantro.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.079
Oh, yeah. Oh, man,
I'm loving the sauce already.

13:33.080 --> 13:37.083
Oh, this is legendary sauce
going back to 1934.

13:37.084 --> 13:38.550
Guacamole, you don't think
it's gonna work,

13:38.551 --> 13:39.718
but it absolutely does.

13:39.719 --> 13:40.987
Wow.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.989
Gives it a little spice
on the end.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.423
I love it.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.225
You, by your own admission,

13:46.226 --> 13:50.596
you're sort of a sorry
excuse for a Mexican.

13:50.597 --> 13:51.998
You... you don't...
How's your Spanish?

13:51.999 --> 13:53.765
Not so good.
Spanish is horrible.

13:53.766 --> 13:57.937
I mean, I've always been given
a hard time about my Spanish.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.671
- Mm-hmm.
- And that's okay.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.573
Every Mexican in history
has always given shit

14:01.574 --> 14:03.409
to another Mexican
about their Spanish.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.710
"You don't know this lingo.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.078
You don't know
this pronunciation."

14:06.079 --> 14:07.914
But yeah, you should know
Spanish better.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.749
Well, that's what I learned.
This has been an age-old thing

14:10.750 --> 14:13.953
where everyone's trying
to out Chicano each other,

14:13.954 --> 14:15.521
and I shouldn't feel
that bad about it.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.257
Right, what's the expression
for a bad Chicano?

14:18.258 --> 14:19.525
- Pocho.
- Pocho.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.427
Is there a literal
translation there?

14:21.428 --> 14:22.962
Rotting.
So if you say "pocho,"

14:22.963 --> 14:24.796
you're basically saying,
"You're a rotting Mexican.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.566
"You're completely fake,
you've lost all your culture,

14:27.567 --> 14:29.101
therefore you should be hated."

14:29.102 --> 14:30.769
- That's harsh.
- I know.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.138
When you hear, like,

14:32.139 --> 14:34.406
about rounding up
Mexicans left and right,

14:34.407 --> 14:35.774
sending them all... all off to
camps,

14:35.775 --> 14:37.743
and then putting them
across the border,

14:37.744 --> 14:39.745
scary, angry?

14:39.746 --> 14:41.247
I actually think it's good.

14:41.248 --> 14:45.484
I think Latinos need this
to rally together to excite.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.885
The world needs aliens to land

14:46.886 --> 14:49.088
till it'll actually
come together.

14:49.089 --> 14:53.292
Is there anybody who could
rally all Mexicans, you know?

14:53.293 --> 14:56.595
- Like a spokesperson, yeah.
- No, like a Mexican Reagan.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.098
The last big leader
was Cesar Chavez,

14:59.099 --> 15:01.800
and that was, God, what,
25 years ago at this point.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.470
I mean, you have to have
almost a messianic figure.

15:04.471 --> 15:05.972
- I have the answer.
- Who?

15:05.973 --> 15:07.606
- Danny Trejo.
- Oh, Wow.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.909
- Danny Trejo. People love him.
- Danny Trejo would be the man.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.979
He would be... that's the guy.
I would vote for him.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.413
- Machete.
- Machete for president.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.316
- I would totally vote for him.
- He's ancient.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.985
He looks good
with his shirt off.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.486
Donald Trump can't say that.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.021
Bill Clinton can't say that.

15:22.022 --> 15:25.191
Danny Trejo's still peeling
that shirt off.

15:25.192 --> 15:28.761
He's the baddest dude
in the history of badass.

15:30.330 --> 15:34.333
Look up "badass"
in the dictionary.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.467
It says "Trejo."

15:35.468 --> 15:37.303
♪

15:37.304 --> 15:39.271
"Danny Trejo."

15:39.272 --> 15:41.840
♪

15:41.841 --> 15:43.609
Born in Echo Park in LA,

15:43.610 --> 15:46.945
he spent much of his early life
in and out of prison,

15:46.946 --> 15:48.847
including a stay in San Quentin

15:48.848 --> 15:50.482
where he managed
to straighten shit out,

15:50.483 --> 15:53.852
join a 12-step program
and rethink his life.

15:53.853 --> 15:56.288
He came out of the joint
as a drug counselor.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.690
This led directly,
if unexpectedly,

15:58.691 --> 16:03.029
to a storied career in film.

16:03.030 --> 16:06.398
Danny Trejo is known and loved
for iconic tough guy roles

16:06.399 --> 16:07.699
in such films as "Heat"...

16:07.700 --> 16:09.035
There's cops all over me, man.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.402
They're on me like a cheap suit.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.537
"From Dusk Till Dawn-"

16:11.538 --> 16:13.072
Get out!

16:13.073 --> 16:16.708
And, "Once Upon
a Time in Mexico."

16:16.709 --> 16:18.744
But he finally rose
to the action hero

16:18.745 --> 16:20.179
leading man status

16:20.180 --> 16:23.215
he always deserved
playing Machete...

16:23.216 --> 16:25.917
- This is the boss.
- A character who grew out

16:25.918 --> 16:27.886
of a fake trailer
from the Robert Rodriquez,

16:27.887 --> 16:29.388
Quentin Tarantino film,

16:29.389 --> 16:32.524
"Grindhouse," which soon became
its own awesome

16:32.525 --> 16:34.260
and gore-heavy franchise.

16:34.261 --> 16:38.064
If you haven't seen "Machete,"
its follow-up "Machete Kills,"

16:38.065 --> 16:41.367
or a soon to be released
"Machete in Space,"

16:41.368 --> 16:43.235
it's like missing
the "Citizen Kane"

16:43.236 --> 16:46.173
of violent, family friendly fun.

16:50.343 --> 16:55.447
Trejo's Cantina on Cahuenga
Boulevard,

16:55.448 --> 16:59.918
because, of course.

16:59.919 --> 17:01.753
Grand opening is still
a few days away,

17:01.754 --> 17:03.355
but I thought,
since I'm in town,

17:03.356 --> 17:05.124
I'd help advise Danny
on the new menu.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.292
Give him the benefits
of my tasting notes.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.428
And I've got to be honest,
I was thinking,

17:09.429 --> 17:10.929
"How good could it be?

17:10.930 --> 17:14.766
Can Machete run
a good restaurant, and why?"

17:14.767 --> 17:16.568
So are we gonna
see Trejo's Tacos

17:16.569 --> 17:18.137
all across America
at some point?

17:18.137 --> 17:23.075
Oh, that would be awesome.
Taco truck on every corner.

17:23.076 --> 17:26.113
- This is delicious.
- Awesome.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.618
On the menu tonight,
jidori chicken

17:32.619 --> 17:34.453
with chipotle cream sauce,

17:34.454 --> 17:36.822
some charred branzino
with summer squash

17:36.823 --> 17:39.057
and sautéed poblano peppers,

17:39.058 --> 17:41.627
and crispy pork tacos
with black garlic mole

17:41.628 --> 17:44.062
and some fat sacks of uni,

17:44.063 --> 17:47.466
and lots of healthy greens.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.800
Why healthy? I mean...

17:48.801 --> 17:50.936
Because we have
such an obese problem

17:50.937 --> 17:53.405
in the United States,
especially Latinos,

17:53.406 --> 17:57.943
so we had to find a way
to make it tasty but healthy.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.747
Healthy food can taste good.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.082
Green, healthier, lighter,

18:04.083 --> 18:06.485
locally sourced versions
of Mexican street classics

18:06.486 --> 18:08.987
are not exactly
what I'd expected,

18:08.988 --> 18:11.657
and I sure as shit
ain't making no rude cracks

18:11.658 --> 18:13.259
about vegan tacos.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.261
Not to this man.
Though to be fair,

18:15.262 --> 18:18.798
Danny Trejo is, like,
the nicest guy in the world.

18:21.468 --> 18:24.370
Here's something I discovered
that completely shocked

18:24.371 --> 18:27.005
and surprised me,
so I have to ask you.

18:27.006 --> 18:29.341
Are you a Morrissey fan
by any chance?

18:29.342 --> 18:31.510
- Morrissey?
- Like, from this band,

18:31.511 --> 18:33.111
The Smiths.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.846
Apparently, it's like
a British rock band

18:34.847 --> 18:36.482
of the late '80s that is

18:36.483 --> 18:39.451
apparently hugely popular
in the Chicano community.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.688
So you have not been
touched by this, this...

18:42.689 --> 18:45.624
I'm gonna tell you something
right now between me and you.

18:45.625 --> 18:49.528
I listen to no music that came

18:49.529 --> 18:53.400
after the 1968.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.203
I'm, like, the oldies guy.
You know what I mean?

18:57.204 --> 19:00.672
So I know your parents
were born in Texas.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.241
Yeah.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.211
But can you trace your people
back to one area in Mexico?

19:05.212 --> 19:06.645
Monterrey.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.880
My grandmother and grandfather
were born in Monterrey.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.216
Did you speak Spanish
at home, or...

19:10.217 --> 19:12.050
Yeah, yeah, we spoke, we spoke,

19:12.051 --> 19:16.188
I spoke Spanish until I was
about nine, ten, and then,

19:16.189 --> 19:18.724
usually you stop
speaking Spanish

19:18.725 --> 19:20.392
when you go to grammar school,

19:20.393 --> 19:22.761
especially in the '50s
because they wouldn't let you.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.596
"No, no, you don't
speak Spanish," you know?

19:24.597 --> 19:25.997
So you kind of forget.
Right.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.033
So then... but then when you
start going

19:28.034 --> 19:31.237
to juvenile hall and jail,

19:31.238 --> 19:32.671
you pick it up again
so the guards

19:32.672 --> 19:34.406
won't know
what you're talking about.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.208
Did you get in a 12-step

19:36.209 --> 19:37.543
while you were still
in prison or after?

19:37.544 --> 19:39.711
When I was in prison.
That was 1968.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.913
Cinco de Mayo in 1968.

19:41.914 --> 19:44.950
That was where I just kind of
like made a vow.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.285
I'm... you know, I'm done, you
know?

19:46.286 --> 19:49.255
When you get out,
you became a drug counselor.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.923
I dedicated my life
to helping other people.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.792
Everything good that
has happened

19:53.793 --> 19:55.894
to me has happened
as a direct result

19:55.895 --> 19:57.396
of helping someone else,
everything.

19:57.397 --> 20:01.967
Well, for example,
you were called to a film set

20:01.968 --> 20:05.971
to counsel somebody,
and you bump into,

20:05.972 --> 20:07.539
of all the people in the world,
Edward Bunker.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.609
- Eddie Bunker.
- The sort legendary ex-con

20:10.610 --> 20:12.744
turned writer and,

20:12.745 --> 20:14.780
I guess, screenwriter as well.

20:14.781 --> 20:18.450
I... I knew Eddie in prison,
you see.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.151
And so when he saw me,
"What are you doing here?"

20:20.152 --> 20:21.620
I said, "I'm working
with this kid."

20:21.621 --> 20:23.889
And then he asked me,
"Are you still boxing?"

20:23.890 --> 20:25.291
because I held the lightweight

20:25.292 --> 20:26.725
and welterweight champion
of every joint I was in.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.827
I said, "I'm training.
I still train",

20:28.828 --> 20:30.629
but I don't want to get hit
in the face anymore."

20:30.630 --> 20:32.331
And he said,

20:32.332 --> 20:35.302
"We need somebody to train
one of the actors how to box."

20:37.470 --> 20:40.272
The movie was
the awesome "Runaway Train."

20:40.273 --> 20:42.441
Trejo trained and fought
against the actor,

20:42.442 --> 20:44.743
Eric Roberts,
who, along with Jon Voight,

20:44.744 --> 20:47.346
earned Academy Award
nominations for the film.

20:47.347 --> 20:50.949
For Danny, it was the start
of a long and glorious career.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.651
He never looked back.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.420
I'll never forget,
Andrei Konchalovsky,

20:54.421 --> 20:57.188
the director, a Russian
aristocrat, right, he says,

20:57.189 --> 21:00.759
"You fight Eric in movie.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.160
You be my friend."

21:02.161 --> 21:05.697
Now, if you come out
of the penitentiary

21:05.698 --> 21:07.165
and somebody says,

21:07.166 --> 21:10.168
"You be my friend,"
it's kind of a red flag.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.438
Right.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.205
And then how many films
since then, man?

21:14.206 --> 21:15.541
A whole hell of a lot.
Oh, yeah, they've got to be

21:15.542 --> 21:18.043
at about 320
or something, you know?

21:18.044 --> 21:20.512
You moved from there
to serious bad guys...

21:20.513 --> 21:24.450
- Yeah.
- To now action hero franchise.

21:24.451 --> 21:26.518
How do you stay nice
in a business basically

21:26.519 --> 21:28.320
full of [...]holes?

21:28.321 --> 21:30.556
Eddie Bunker, the first time
when I started getting,

21:30.557 --> 21:33.792
like, a little recognition,
he told me something.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.528
He said, "Try to remember"

21:36.529 --> 21:40.031
"that the whole world
can think you're a movie star,

21:40.032 --> 21:41.667
but you can't."

21:41.668 --> 21:43.835
And I've watched
movie stars, right?

21:43.836 --> 21:45.036
I hate them.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.638
You know, nobody likes them.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.375
And if you, like, if you're,
like, on a movie set

21:49.376 --> 21:50.842
and the movie star comes in,

21:50.843 --> 21:53.044
then after he leaves,
this is how everybody talks,

21:53.045 --> 21:54.713
"That guy's an ass.
I hate that guy.

21:54.714 --> 21:58.149
Man, he's rude."
So I don't want to be that guy.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.718
- Right.
- You know what I mean?

21:59.719 --> 22:01.052
One if the things
I've learned, actually,

22:01.053 --> 22:02.388
making television
really early on,

22:02.389 --> 22:04.222
if, like, you show up to, like,

22:04.223 --> 22:05.891
shoot and the people, like,

22:05.892 --> 22:07.659
with the cameras
and the crew say,

22:07.660 --> 22:09.227
"Oh, the talent is on set,"

22:09.228 --> 22:11.863
what they really mean
is the [...]hole is on set.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.599
You know, when somebody
calls me the talent or refers

22:13.600 --> 22:15.501
to me as the talent,
it's, like, time to go back

22:15.502 --> 22:18.438
and take a long look
in the mirror, right?

22:31.551 --> 22:32.051
♪

22:53.406 --> 22:53.906
♪

22:57.477 --> 22:59.745
They ain't from LA,
but from time to time,

22:59.746 --> 23:01.246
you'll find them here,

23:01.247 --> 23:03.715
and when you do,
you best play nice.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.284
Gilbert Melendez,

23:06.285 --> 23:10.456
Nick Diaz, and Nate Diaz,

23:10.457 --> 23:13.792
three of the greatest
mixed martial artists

23:13.793 --> 23:17.095
to ever fight in an octagon.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.497
Gilbert holds the distinction

23:18.498 --> 23:20.298
of being one
of the few MMA fighters

23:20.299 --> 23:22.634
to be ranked number
one in the world

23:22.635 --> 23:24.302
in two weight classes.

23:24.303 --> 23:25.737
Nate and his older brother Nick

23:25.738 --> 23:29.441
are both vicious strikers
and grapplers,

23:29.442 --> 23:33.144
and about as tough as it gets
in a professional setting

23:33.145 --> 23:35.814
or on the street.

23:35.815 --> 23:38.349
Neither particularly likes
to fight they say,

23:38.350 --> 23:40.619
but should the situation
call for it,

23:40.620 --> 23:45.024
well, let's put it this way,
they will.

23:49.328 --> 23:51.329
Nick and Nate
grew up in Stockton

23:51.330 --> 23:53.832
and still live there
and train there.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.501
Conor McGregor mocked Nate

23:55.502 --> 23:58.537
for teaching kids
jujitsu in his hometown.

23:58.538 --> 24:01.306
That was before Nate
chased him around the octagon

24:01.307 --> 24:06.011
like a little deer
in his last close decision.

24:06.012 --> 24:09.014
In one of the greatest fights
in UFC history,

24:09.015 --> 24:11.149
Nate Diaz shocked the world

24:11.150 --> 24:12.551
when, on very short notice,

24:12.552 --> 24:15.787
he stepped in
and submitted McGregor

24:15.788 --> 24:16.722
in two rounds.

24:16.723 --> 24:18.957
Nate Diaz.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.226
He lost the second
bout by decision,

24:21.227 --> 24:23.529
but there will
surely be a third,

24:23.530 --> 24:25.296
and no matter what happens,

24:25.297 --> 24:29.200
Nate Diaz always brings it.

24:29.201 --> 24:34.173
Mariscos Chente
on South Centinela.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.912
What did you... what do you eat
growing up? Like, what do you-

24:40.913 --> 24:42.413
in your house,
when you were little kids,

24:42.414 --> 24:44.716
what kind of food
were you eating?

24:44.717 --> 24:46.484
What's lunch?

24:46.485 --> 24:48.053
Macaroni and cheese
and hot dogs.

24:48.054 --> 24:51.256
Yeah, man, hot dogs, right.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.891
That was basically,
like, Top Ramen.

24:52.892 --> 24:55.326
Every day.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.195
- Yeah.
- Hot dogs, mac and cheese?

24:57.196 --> 24:58.564
- Some ghetto juice.
- What about you?

24:58.565 --> 25:00.566
You know, rice and beans
and some sort of Mexican dish.

25:00.567 --> 25:02.167
Some sort of protein with it
and everything, you know.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.569
- Right.
- I'm not vegetarian,

25:03.570 --> 25:05.336
but I learned
a lot from them though.

25:05.337 --> 25:09.207
I was, like,
pretty much vegan for...

25:09.208 --> 25:11.442
For years really.
Even as a kid? No.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.278
Like, I stopped
eating land animals period.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.746
Like, I was... I'm a vegetarian,

25:14.747 --> 25:16.748
but I've been
eating seafood on and off,

25:16.749 --> 25:18.917
but I've been a vegetarian
since I was, like,

25:18.918 --> 25:20.518
since I was 18 years old.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.554
I just would be better cutting
weight when I would just go

25:22.555 --> 25:24.623
on [inaudible] vegetarian diet.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.391
- Right.
- I end up, you know,

25:26.392 --> 25:28.627
nice and light,
and then I get stronger.

25:28.628 --> 25:31.429
And then once he started
fighting pro too,

25:31.430 --> 25:34.099
I think he kind of started
doing the same type of thing.

25:34.100 --> 25:37.769
When you eat in LA,
if you're going out for food,

25:37.770 --> 25:39.270
what are you going out for,
Asian?

25:39.271 --> 25:40.772
You're going out
for Pad Thai food...

25:40.773 --> 25:42.540
Good food's pretty convenient
around here, of course.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.110
I go to... I go to Venice Beach.

25:45.111 --> 25:48.914
I go to Café Gratitude,
and that's a really good place.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.749
What do you eat there?

25:50.750 --> 25:53.619
It's, like, vegan,
vegetarian all the way.

25:53.620 --> 25:56.989
I get off the plane,
I go right to In-N-Out Burger.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.325
And the last thing
I do while I'm in town

26:00.326 --> 26:01.761
is I stop at In-N-Out Burger.

26:02.829 --> 26:04.295
That stuff is like crack for me.

26:04.296 --> 26:06.265
I got to have it.

26:07.299 --> 26:09.501
Oh, it's so good.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.138
Mariscos Chente serves shrimp.

26:13.139 --> 26:15.406
Lots and lots of shrimp.

26:15.407 --> 26:18.076
The house special,
camarones borrachos,

26:18.077 --> 26:19.611
or drunken shrimp,

26:19.612 --> 26:22.447
sautéed in butter
and garlic over high heat.

26:22.448 --> 26:24.916
Add cilantro,
and crushed peppers,

26:24.917 --> 26:26.918
and finish with tequila.

26:26.919 --> 26:27.419
♪

26:37.830 --> 26:40.131
So when was your first fight,
like, in school?

26:40.132 --> 26:41.332
Like, what grade?

26:41.333 --> 26:42.367
- First.
- First grade?

26:42.368 --> 26:44.970
- Just kidding.
- No.

26:44.971 --> 26:47.605
Yeah, [inaudible]
my first fight, right?

26:47.606 --> 26:49.641
One time I was in sixth grade,

26:49.642 --> 26:51.509
and I went down
to the baseball field

26:51.510 --> 26:53.144
waiting for foul balls

26:53.145 --> 26:55.113
because when you catch
a foul ball you get free soda

26:55.114 --> 26:56.948
or a bag of chips or something.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.785
And I caught the ball, and one
of the baseball players was mad

26:59.786 --> 27:02.320
because a littler kid was
trying to run up and get it.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.455
Like, "What's up? Why didn't you
let him get the ball?"

27:04.456 --> 27:07.025
I'm like, "Shut up. I've been
waiting all day for this ball."

27:07.026 --> 27:08.526
You know what I'm saying.
I was a little kid.

27:08.527 --> 27:10.195
And he tried to get
in a fight with me,

27:10.196 --> 27:12.030
but I'm with these guys
and they're all hard core.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.665
And I'm in my head like,
"Man, why they gonna make me

27:13.666 --> 27:17.368
fight this guy, because..."
in my head, right?

27:17.369 --> 27:19.204
I was, "Man, they're making me
fight this guy."

27:19.205 --> 27:20.706
And we're, like, going at it,

27:20.707 --> 27:22.640
and I've never been
punched in my face

27:22.641 --> 27:24.209
so many times in my life, right?

27:24.210 --> 27:26.144
I was just a little kid.
He used to swing kind of wide

27:26.145 --> 27:27.545
back then.
I was all heart.

27:27.546 --> 27:29.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Why you make me fight?

27:29.081 --> 27:31.718
That's mean.
Why you make me fight this guy?

27:45.832 --> 27:48.734
Street tacos are a not guilty
at all pleasure for me,

27:48.735 --> 27:53.939
something of an obsession,
they always make me happy.

27:53.940 --> 27:56.341
But Mexican food
has been redefining itself

27:56.342 --> 27:58.409
in significant ways for years,

27:58.410 --> 28:00.211
here and in Mexico.

28:00.212 --> 28:03.414
Across the city, young,
extremely talented chefs

28:03.415 --> 28:07.753
are taking Mexican traditions
to the next level and beyond.

28:07.754 --> 28:13.058
Maybe the most exciting new
frontier of modern cooking.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.460
Chef Ray Garcia,
a native Angelino

28:15.461 --> 28:18.263
is one of those pioneers.

28:18.264 --> 28:21.599
Located in the heart
of downtown is Broken Spanish,

28:21.600 --> 28:22.934
a higher-end,

28:22.935 --> 28:24.602
higher-priced Mexican restaurant

28:24.603 --> 28:27.939
than most are accustomed to.

28:27.940 --> 28:31.576
Chef Eddie Ruiz and Robin
Chopra are childhood friends

28:31.577 --> 28:33.644
who opened the wonderful,
but short-lived

28:33.645 --> 28:36.081
Alta California Gastro Pub

28:36.082 --> 28:37.983
Corazon y Miel,

28:37.984 --> 28:41.152
which put them both on the map
in LA's burgeoning,

28:41.153 --> 28:44.823
modern Mexican dining scene.

28:44.824 --> 28:47.959
I absolutely believe
that the next big thing

28:47.960 --> 28:53.064
is a re-evaluation of Mexican
flavors and ingredients,

28:53.065 --> 28:56.467
and a re-evaluation
of how much you should pay.

28:56.468 --> 28:59.237
I mean, people love it,
but their expectations is,

28:59.238 --> 29:00.471
Mexican food should be cheap,

29:00.472 --> 29:01.739
and the fact is there's always

29:01.740 --> 29:03.641
gonna be new arrivals
from Mexico

29:03.642 --> 29:05.443
who are perfectly willing
to sell you,

29:05.444 --> 29:07.412
unfortunately or fortunately,

29:07.413 --> 29:10.481
really good Mexican food
for very cheap,

29:10.482 --> 29:13.318
but not the kind of deep flavors

29:13.319 --> 29:14.652
that, you know, you find,

29:14.653 --> 29:17.122
or I've found
in my travels there.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.990
Well, sometimes
in the Mexican world

29:18.991 --> 29:21.026
the only thing
that's passed down,

29:21.027 --> 29:23.094
it's not a home,
it's not a necklace,

29:23.095 --> 29:25.430
what it is is
a recipe passed down

29:25.431 --> 29:27.032
from generation to generation.

29:27.033 --> 29:30.268
It all comes from these rustic
dishes that our grandmothers

29:30.269 --> 29:32.170
and grandpas cooked for us.

29:32.171 --> 29:35.841
Do you have
any responsibility to preserve

29:35.842 --> 29:37.542
and protect
the traditional flavors

29:37.543 --> 29:39.210
and ingredients of Mexico

29:39.211 --> 29:40.478
or do you- or not?

29:40.479 --> 29:41.646
Yeah, of course.

29:41.647 --> 29:42.981
Everything that you see here

29:42.982 --> 29:44.349
in front of you is inspired

29:44.350 --> 29:45.817
by something
that we had as a child,

29:45.818 --> 29:48.954
but how do we present
that with our training,

29:48.955 --> 29:51.189
and how do we present
that with our experience

29:51.190 --> 29:54.993
that's gonna give people value
to want to pay more for it?

29:54.994 --> 29:57.963
I think that Los Angeles
is kind of a stage

29:57.964 --> 29:59.630
for that next level,

29:59.631 --> 30:03.534
and Chef Ray is doing
a really good job of that.

30:03.535 --> 30:05.470
He's presenting stuff like this,

30:05.471 --> 30:07.305
and that's what's gonna
elevate people's mind-set

30:07.306 --> 30:10.877
in terms of what you can do
with this food.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.748
Chicharrones, skin on pork,
cured and salted,

30:17.749 --> 30:19.717
cooked sous vide for 36 hours,

30:19.718 --> 30:21.419
then deep fried and served

30:21.420 --> 30:24.923
with elephant garlic mojo
and radish sprouts.

30:24.924 --> 30:27.825
♪

30:27.826 --> 30:29.727
Tamales of slow-cooked lamb neck

30:29.728 --> 30:33.532
with oyster mushrooms
and queso Oaxaca.

30:36.068 --> 30:39.704
Camote, an Okinawan sweet
potato filled with pork,

30:39.705 --> 30:42.607
the ears, tails and snout,

30:42.608 --> 30:47.212
topped with a drizzle
of piloncillo syrup.

30:47.213 --> 30:48.779
I got one more present
for you guys here.

30:48.780 --> 30:50.181
A little pre-dessert, Eddie.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.416
I know it's your favorite,
Eddie.

30:51.417 --> 30:52.783
It's my favorite.

30:52.784 --> 30:54.886
We have the foie gras
rebanada here.

30:54.887 --> 30:56.554
So it's sort of like
a pre-dessert.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.023
It's my take on
a very traditional

30:58.024 --> 31:00.191
and simple Mexican pan dulce.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.627
Which is, like,
a brioche with butter

31:02.628 --> 31:04.595
and sugar is just
the basic pan dulce.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.231
So this here, we have
foie gras in our butter,

31:06.232 --> 31:08.566
we kind of up
the ante a little bit,

31:08.567 --> 31:10.235
and then some piloncillo.

31:10.236 --> 31:11.602
Sweet. Thank you.

31:11.603 --> 31:13.538
Man, I am loving...
I am loving this meal.

31:13.539 --> 31:14.639
- Thank you.
- I mean, big-time.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.942
Thank you so much. Thank you.

31:16.943 --> 31:19.644
This is the most nostalgic dish

31:19.645 --> 31:21.279
I've ever had at a restaurant
in Los Angeles.

31:21.280 --> 31:25.450
In Mexican panaderías,
this is called rebanada.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.785
- Wow.
- Nothing says my childhood

31:27.786 --> 31:31.222
like this dish right here.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.458
I've worked in French
and Italian restaurants

31:33.459 --> 31:34.392
my whole career.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.893
Right.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.096
But, I mean, really,
if I think about it,

31:38.097 --> 31:41.266
they're Mexican restaurants
and Ecuadorian restaurants

31:41.267 --> 31:43.234
because the majority
of the cooks

31:43.235 --> 31:46.071
and the people working with me
were from those countries.

31:46.072 --> 31:48.673
That's who, you know,
picked me up when I fell down,

31:48.674 --> 31:50.308
who showed me what to do
when I walked in

31:50.309 --> 31:53.278
and didn't know anything,
and nobody knew my name.

31:53.279 --> 31:56.081
Right, it's just the way
our culture is.

31:56.082 --> 32:00.318
We're so family oriented
that that's what matters to us.

32:00.319 --> 32:03.521
At the same time
I feel like our job as chefs

32:03.522 --> 32:06.157
is to bring in our unique,

32:06.158 --> 32:10.261
Latin American experience
to dining,

32:10.262 --> 32:14.165
family, tradition,
food, culture,

32:14.166 --> 32:15.766
and LA's the heart of that
right now.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.035
It really is.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.636
And hopefully that resonates

32:18.637 --> 32:20.639
throughout the rest
of the country.

32:32.184 --> 32:34.319
Gang violence has been
part of LA's story

32:34.320 --> 32:37.622
for the better part
of a century now.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.224
Also part of the story,

32:39.225 --> 32:42.494
police corruption and brutality.

32:45.197 --> 32:49.067
Former police officer
Alex Salazar was a bad cop.

32:49.068 --> 32:52.670
By his own admission, very bad.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.672
Like a lot of once good police,

32:54.673 --> 32:55.906
the streets changed him.

32:55.907 --> 32:57.675
He saw a lot of ugliness,

32:57.676 --> 32:59.644
the lines became blurred,

32:59.645 --> 33:01.346
the job ground him down,

33:01.347 --> 33:05.550
and he crossed the line...
repeatedly.

33:05.551 --> 33:07.085
To quote Nietzsche,

33:07.086 --> 33:09.854
"Those who chase monsters
need to be careful

33:09.855 --> 33:11.656
that they don't
become monsters."

33:11.657 --> 33:14.225
I thought I was gonna
arrest the bad guys.

33:14.226 --> 33:17.163
I never thought I would become
a bad guy myself.

33:21.233 --> 33:24.835
- Did you become a bad guy?
- Oh, I did, yes.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.938
- How bad?
- I became very aggressive,

33:27.939 --> 33:29.840
beating people, losing control,

33:29.841 --> 33:31.442
and using excessive force

33:31.443 --> 33:34.245
when there really wasn't
any need for me to do that.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.914
I mean, I worked the most
infamous police station

33:36.915 --> 33:39.016
ever known.
It was called Rampart.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.386
Won best picture
for Denzel Washington

33:41.387 --> 33:44.622
for his betrayal of this
really bad police officer.

33:44.623 --> 33:45.890
I'm the police.

33:45.891 --> 33:48.559
I run shit here.
You just live here.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.560
Was that an understatement?

33:49.561 --> 33:51.096
Were there cops that bad?

33:51.097 --> 33:52.563
Yes, there were,
yes, there were.

33:52.564 --> 33:53.931
I was one of them.

33:53.932 --> 33:55.933
The problem was very systemic.

33:55.934 --> 33:58.103
We don't have so much
that problem anymore.

33:58.104 --> 34:00.037
It does happen.
Is it not the nature of

34:00.038 --> 34:02.940
the job when you're asked
to every day go in

34:02.941 --> 34:04.609
and look at people

34:04.610 --> 34:06.811
at their most desperate and ugly

34:06.812 --> 34:09.880
that you become desensitized

34:09.880 --> 34:12.049
and maybe
even turn into a monster?

34:12.050 --> 34:13.784
Just think about it.

34:13.784 --> 34:16.286
Every day they're looking
at the worst of society,

34:16.288 --> 34:19.590
and maybe they have a partner
that gets killed or shot.

34:19.591 --> 34:21.958
It's all very overwhelming.

34:21.960 --> 34:26.563
Many turn to alcohol
and drugs to medicate.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.998
And I'm not trying to be
an apologist for the police,

34:29.000 --> 34:32.303
because, you know, they do need
to be held accountable,

34:32.304 --> 34:34.672
but, you know, we need
to help them, we really do,

34:34.672 --> 34:38.074
because they are out there,

34:38.076 --> 34:42.112

are gonna show up at your home.

living in East LA,

34:44.650 --> 34:47.818

34:47.819 --> 34:49.018
you calling on the police

34:49.020 --> 34:52.123
expecting
a sympathetic response?

34:52.123 --> 34:55.659
I mean, generally speaking,
what do you think the...

34:55.661 --> 34:58.329
I think most police officers
show up

34:58.330 --> 35:00.131
being ready to help out.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.099
They certainly have to do
their job, take a report.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.934
But, I mean, what do you
think the victim thinks

35:03.935 --> 35:05.170
when they place a phone call?

35:05.171 --> 35:06.471
Do you think they have
high hopes that,

35:06.472 --> 35:08.873
"I believe, like, my call
is gonna be handled

35:08.874 --> 35:11.842
"with the same fervor

35:11.843 --> 35:14.479
as somebody calling
from Beverly Hills?"

35:14.480 --> 35:17.982
Well, there are good officers
that come in, and they do help.

35:17.983 --> 35:21.786
There's also many who lose
that empathetic feeling

35:21.787 --> 35:23.954
