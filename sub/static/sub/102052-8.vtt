00:12.846 --> 00:14.806
[Roche] <i>Things fall apart, right?</i>

00:15.640 --> 00:16.641
<i>Or do they?</i>

00:17.559 --> 00:19.644
<i>Who can tell anymore what's true,</i>

00:20.645 --> 00:22.147
<i>what's a Wilford ruse?</i>

00:22.230 --> 00:23.189
Okay.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.526
[Roche] <i>So we hang on</i>
<i>too tight to what we do know.</i>

00:27.569 --> 00:29.654
<i>Crack ourselves into harder factions.</i>

00:31.072 --> 00:34.576
<i>We're not afraid of our</i>
<i>Ag-Sec failing or Biosecurity anymore.</i>

00:34.659 --> 00:38.621
<i>We're lighting red lanterns for Wilford</i>
<i>because we're afraid of each other.</i>

00:53.261 --> 00:54.095
<i>And me?</i>

00:54.804 --> 00:56.973
<i>I'm out here selling</i>
<i>the only common ground left,</i>

00:57.557 --> 00:59.100
<i>that we're all human beings.</i>

01:01.311 --> 01:05.690
<i>You know, who need love</i>
<i>and connection</i> <i>and space for hope.</i>

01:06.691 --> 01:07.901
<i>Or we kill each other.</i>

01:07.984 --> 01:09.194
[sighs]

01:12.405 --> 01:15.825
[Roche] <i>What is it about recent history</i>
<i>that's so fricking hard to remember?</i>

01:23.917 --> 01:25.293
[alarm blaring]

01:44.604 --> 01:46.606
[Roche] <i>Well, the Eternal Engineer,</i>

01:47.190 --> 01:49.442
<i>he's always been</i>
<i>a social engineer, hasn't he?</i>

01:50.026 --> 01:50.944
<i>He'd have to be.</i>

01:51.528 --> 01:53.530
<i>He rendered us all into his system.</i>

01:54.531 --> 01:56.741
<i>And even though his Engine may be eternal,</i>

01:57.534 --> 02:00.954
<i>the rest of </i>Snowpiercer,
<i>she still runs on meat.</i>

02:03.456 --> 02:06.042
<i>All 1,034 cars long.</i>

02:09.420 --> 02:11.422
[theme music playing]

02:27.438 --> 02:30.567
He confessed, Boki,
like I'm sitting here with you.

02:31.151 --> 02:35.029
And then he cinched his little
homemade murder-bag around his throat,

02:35.113 --> 02:36.865
and tried to freeze his own head off.

02:38.783 --> 02:40.577
[Boscovic] You love this story, don't you?

02:41.161 --> 02:44.455
More cover, from a Tailie for the Tailies.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.291
I hate this story, Breachman.

02:46.916 --> 02:50.086
But I gotta keep telling it.
I gotta get on the loudspeaker

02:50.170 --> 02:53.006
and defend the Tail
to the whole train because it's true.

02:53.089 --> 02:53.965
They didn't do it.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.342
You want revenge.

02:56.926 --> 02:57.760
I get it.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.054
But you gotta open your eyes.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.350
Thirty years…

03:05.268 --> 03:07.228
I risk my life for Wilford.

03:08.229 --> 03:10.148
Thirty years.

03:11.858 --> 03:12.775
No,

03:13.610 --> 03:15.695
he would not have his Breachmen killed.

03:15.778 --> 03:17.822
[Roche] Boki, take some time.

03:18.406 --> 03:19.449
Help us hold the middle.

03:22.201 --> 03:24.787
I'm glad we had this meeting,
but cross him off the list.

03:25.622 --> 03:26.497
[sighs]

03:27.540 --> 03:29.542
[Miss Audrey singing along ‘Joey’
by Concrete Blonde]

03:31.252 --> 03:33.379
Engineer. [chuckles]

03:33.463 --> 03:34.839
It's been eons.

03:40.553 --> 03:44.182
She can sing, but can she clean her room?

03:44.265 --> 03:45.433
[Wilford] Show some respect.

03:45.516 --> 03:48.603
The woman's just
got back on her horse. You'll see.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.941
Lovely stretch of track, the Mongol.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.236
Undulating, efficient terrain.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.072
You're bathing too much.

03:59.656 --> 04:00.573
Beg your pardon?

04:01.407 --> 04:04.911
You think when you bathe,
so you must be up to something.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.331
Well, Engineer Cavill,
if I was up to something,

04:08.414 --> 04:11.167
you don't necessarily
need to know about it, do you?

04:12.043 --> 04:14.712
I noticed that there was
an intentional breach this morning.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.715
That was <i>Snowpiercer,</i>
jettisoning the dead.

04:17.799 --> 04:22.220
Nope, not that breach.
On this train, actually, in our cold lock.

04:23.429 --> 04:26.015
Well, they're probably
just testing the seal.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.230
It hasn't been like this before.

04:32.313 --> 04:35.149
Walking around,
I can feel it, I got no-go zones.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.860
There were a lot
of red lanterns last night.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.946
The Tail can't move freely at all.

04:40.029 --> 04:41.906
Most of us are right back there again.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.574
Half the train is brainwashed.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.076
We've lost the Tunnelmen.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.161
They're openly calling
for Wilford's return.

04:47.245 --> 04:50.456
Doesn't matter
that I got two suspects behind bars.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.292
People believe what they wanna believe.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.127
What about Second Class?

04:54.210 --> 04:55.837
Most of us still back you.

04:56.754 --> 04:59.132
The Bourgeoisie
will hold the middle long as they can.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.842
That's why we always get screwed.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.219
Did you all get on
at the last whistle stop?

05:03.303 --> 05:06.556
-You got the Brakemen, you can relax.
-[Layton] You sure about that?

05:06.639 --> 05:09.851
I saw some of your boys throwing up
the Wilford horns at the funeral.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.312
Yeah, that's for the Breachmen.
It's tradition.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.939
They're holding their posts.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.566
They'll follow me.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.277
[Carly] I still don't get it.
Why don't you let me stay here?

05:19.360 --> 05:22.322
-[Anne] It's only for a little time.
-It's much safer here.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.073
Hey, Fireball, what's the fuss?

05:24.157 --> 05:26.367
-Dad, why do I have to stay uptrain?
-[Anne] Hi.

05:26.451 --> 05:30.872
Carly, it's just until things settle down,
okay? You'll be back in no time.

05:31.456 --> 05:32.832
You'll be closer to school,

05:32.915 --> 05:35.752
and you don't have to keep going
back and forth through all this.

05:36.836 --> 05:37.754
Hey.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.964
Hey, it's all right. Okay?

05:40.965 --> 05:41.883
Come here.

05:43.217 --> 05:44.302
[Carly] I'm gonna miss you.

05:44.385 --> 05:45.678
Miss you. All right.

05:45.762 --> 05:49.599
Have a look at it this way.
You can misbehave at the Paolis',

05:50.892 --> 05:54.312
just don't make my Brakeman
use his nightstick on you on the way up.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.354
[West chuckles]

05:57.774 --> 05:58.608
[Anne] I love you.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.238
-See you soon.
-Okay.

06:06.908 --> 06:07.742
We love you.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.332
[sighs]

06:15.875 --> 06:16.793
So?

06:17.418 --> 06:19.003
[Roche] We're divided as hell.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.923
Layton's trying to
keep the peace, but we're, you know,

06:22.006 --> 06:24.175
we're one dirty look away
from a civil war.

06:24.967 --> 06:28.096
People have a hard time believing
Pastor Logan had the Breachmen killed.

06:28.679 --> 06:29.514
Do you?

06:31.432 --> 06:33.226
I know you lost your faith on this train.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.645
But for those of us holding on to it,

06:36.646 --> 06:38.106
this one's hard to reconcile.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.068
You keep the faith,
remember? I keep the peace.

06:47.615 --> 06:50.576
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-[both laughing]

06:50.660 --> 06:54.455
The world is ending, baby.
Call a plumber. I'm sorry.

06:56.999 --> 06:57.917
[beeping]

06:58.000 --> 07:00.002
[Javi] We have to have water problems now?

07:00.086 --> 07:03.297
You hoping for all-day autopilot
and a nice long siesta, are you?

07:03.381 --> 07:05.133
Don't take your eyes
off the water pressure.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.927
I'm on it.
You should probably take your wellies.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.220
[sarcastically] Ha ha.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.687
[Ruth] Oh, dear.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.605
Oh… [sighs]

07:20.231 --> 07:23.359
Excuse me. Anne. Anne, what's happened?

07:23.901 --> 07:26.028
Started off
with a tiny leak in our faucet earlier,

07:26.112 --> 07:27.655
now all the cabins are flooding.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.074
Oh, no, here comes Hospitality.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.076
Okay, so, this is where
we shine, LJ. Yeah?

07:32.160 --> 07:34.954
We'll do a bang-up job,
they can't take Janitorial away from us.

07:35.037 --> 07:37.874
-Yeah? Ready?
-Mmm-hmm. Let's Janitor this bitch.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.251
Well, you're in a pickle.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.128
I think this car's in hand, Ms. Wardell.

07:42.211 --> 07:44.881
We're mopping up quickly,
but three cars are affected.

07:44.964 --> 07:45.882
-Three?
-[Osweiller] Yep.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.509
LJ's on top of this,
but there's water in the subtrain now.

07:48.593 --> 07:49.969
I think you better come with me.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.305
I think I better.
All right, go on. Good luck.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.640
-Yeah, don't worry about me.
-We head down this way.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.855
I'm redistributing pressure,
but it's still building.

08:01.772 --> 08:03.941
-Javi, I'm getting a pressure surge.
-Hold on.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.740
-Oh, shit!
-[Jakes] Holy mackerel!

08:10.823 --> 08:12.366
[screams] I'll get it!

08:18.164 --> 08:19.540
[Wilford] Oh, goody, you're awake.

08:19.624 --> 08:22.585
Feels awful after
a tube's been down there, doesn't it?

08:23.419 --> 08:24.462
There you go.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.175
You've been out for some time
since your last goo bath.

08:29.258 --> 08:32.512
I do wish the Headwoods would find
a more scientific-sounding name

08:32.595 --> 08:33.888
for the stuff, don't you?

08:35.973 --> 08:36.849
Oh…

08:38.726 --> 08:39.644
Look.

08:46.984 --> 08:47.944
[Wilford chuckles]

08:55.326 --> 08:56.953
It barely hurts anymore.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.416
Tears might hurt a bit.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.630
Salt on fresh skin. Hmm?

09:08.506 --> 09:09.382
There.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.803
Why have you done this?

09:14.387 --> 09:17.890
I hear you've been having
phantom pain in your missing hand.

09:18.599 --> 09:21.394
I have a little trick
I'd like to play on your mind.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.356
These are your hands.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.361
There you go. [grunts]

09:35.241 --> 09:37.660
Ah, please. Trust me.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.122
Focus on your hands.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.166
Watch me touching them.

09:46.877 --> 09:47.712
Good.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.799
You see, your brain
believes there's still a hand.

09:52.675 --> 09:56.596
A cluster of confused neurons
couldn't make sense of it,

09:56.679 --> 10:00.933
so it became fixated on your pain.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.398
[Wilford grunts]

10:07.481 --> 10:09.525
It's… it's working.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.987
Illusion has its value,
if it takes the pain away.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.615
Not such a far-fetched idea, is it?

10:16.657 --> 10:17.617
Practice.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.911
Retool your brain. It'll be fun.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.129
We won't be locking your door anymore.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.757
Welcome to <i>Big Alice.</i>

10:41.557 --> 10:44.518
[Bennett] Pressure surges
are popping up all over the train.

10:44.602 --> 10:47.480
Our port intake won't close,
so we're taking on too much snow.

10:47.563 --> 10:48.689
Excuse me.

10:48.773 --> 10:52.818
We convert water to hydrogen,
its offshoot supplies water for the train.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.029
So when the gills are jammed open…

10:55.112 --> 10:57.365
Too much hydrogen, and a tsunami of water.

10:57.448 --> 11:01.160
Exactly. It has to be external.
Something's jammed the gills open.

11:02.620 --> 11:06.374
Well, we can manually vent the excess,
but that's gonna slow us down.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.375
So that's serious.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.085
How serious, scale of one to ten?

11:09.752 --> 11:10.753
Normally, a three.

11:10.836 --> 11:13.506
We'd send out a team
of Breachworkers to free it by hand.

11:13.589 --> 11:17.551
But since all our Breachmen are dead
except Boki, who might refuse to do it…

11:17.635 --> 11:19.136
Six out of ten.

11:19.220 --> 11:22.473
We can round that up to a ten,
assuming Wilford's involved.

11:22.556 --> 11:23.849
Not everything's Wilford.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.561
Our intakes do get jammed, it happens.

11:29.313 --> 11:30.815
Boscovic's still grieving.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.567
I gotta ask him to risk his life.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.446
Well, make it fast.
We're gonna start losing time.

11:40.616 --> 11:43.327
-Now it's slowing.
-[door opens]

11:47.164 --> 11:48.040
Oh, it's you.

11:48.833 --> 11:49.792
You clean up well.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.087
Where is he?
He told me I should be here to see this.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.422
To see what?

11:54.505 --> 11:56.424
Oh, he didn't tell you.

11:56.507 --> 11:57.716
Tell me what?

11:58.300 --> 11:59.593
Turn around, darling.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.018
[Alexandra] Bob?

12:17.027 --> 12:17.903
[Wilford sighs]

12:20.281 --> 12:21.615
[Icy Bob moaning and knocking]

12:21.699 --> 12:23.826
-[Mr. Headwood] Wait, wait!
-[Mrs. Headwood] Open it!

12:23.909 --> 12:25.536
-[Mr. Headwood] Wait.
-[Mrs. Headwood] No.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.371
-[Mr. Headwood] Now.
-[Mrs. Headwood] Open it!

12:27.455 --> 12:29.373
-[Bob moaning]
-[Mrs. Headwood] Oh…

12:29.457 --> 12:32.334
-What was he doing?
-[Mr. Headwood] This is very severe.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.087
[Icy Bob shivering]

12:37.089 --> 12:38.757
[Mr. Headwood] Come on, Bob.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.471
[Mr. Headwood] What is that?

12:43.554 --> 12:45.473
An old Breachman's tradition.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.518
[Mrs. Headwood] Why did you
send him out there?

12:50.519 --> 12:51.645
[Icy Bob groaning]

12:58.903 --> 13:00.237
[indistinct chatter]

13:00.321 --> 13:01.238
[Josie] Thank you.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.746
[man] Oh, my God, have you heard?

13:08.829 --> 13:11.040
[woman] Have you heard
what she did to Kevin?

13:14.293 --> 13:15.586
We've never actually met.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.465
Uh… Oh, I know who you are.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.051
Why are you here?

13:22.134 --> 13:24.053
It's amazing what they can do, isn't it?

13:24.136 --> 13:26.847
A little more effort,
you could be beautiful again.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.059
I don't give a shit about being beautiful.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.810
That's probably good.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.023
What's happened on <i>Snowpiercer?</i>

13:36.106 --> 13:37.525
Is Layton still standing?

13:38.526 --> 13:40.194
More like crawling, but yes.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.365
You've defected.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.325
I've returned.

13:47.284 --> 13:48.994
We had very different journeys,

13:49.078 --> 13:51.121
but we were both leaders on <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

13:52.498 --> 13:55.918
We spent years
being responsible for others.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.130
And now that we're here,
without all that weight…

14:02.591 --> 14:05.135
I don't know about you,
but I've never slept so well.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.639
The future is yours if you want it.

14:09.682 --> 14:10.891
Just look in the mirror.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.400
[grunting]

14:21.527 --> 14:22.653
[Boscovic] I knew you'd be coming here.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.906
[grunting] All these bursting pipes.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.575
Boki, I'm sorry.

14:28.742 --> 14:31.328
We know it's not fair
to ask you to go out there alone.

14:33.038 --> 14:36.959
I know you don't wanna hear this from me,
but the train needs you.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.920
The train always need me! [grunts]

14:41.630 --> 14:43.632
[breathing heavily]

14:45.676 --> 14:46.719
What if I say no?

14:46.802 --> 14:47.970
That would not be good.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.222
An intake's pretty serious.

14:51.891 --> 14:55.603
The last Breachworker
between you and the abyss…

14:57.563 --> 15:00.399
Look, I'm not down here
giving you an order, man.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.401
It's your call.

15:07.531 --> 15:08.574
Okeydokey.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.659
Time to go outside.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.788
[door closes]

15:24.882 --> 15:26.050
[breathing heavily]

15:26.967 --> 15:29.094
Hi, Josie.

15:30.721 --> 15:31.639
Hi.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.850
What have they given you for the pain?

15:37.144 --> 15:39.146
I'm ready.

15:40.606 --> 15:45.402
I served… my purpose.

15:45.486 --> 15:49.239
No, no. You have a far greater purpose
than being Wilford's weapon.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.325
[Mrs. Headwood] I agree, he did.

15:58.207 --> 16:01.293
Years of grafting synthetic tissue.

16:01.835 --> 16:04.004
Horrible frostbite, like yours.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.006
We rebuilt him.

16:06.548 --> 16:11.095
And now,
we will never discover his full potential.

16:13.764 --> 16:14.890
We need you resting.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.477
Now more than ever.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.400
[door opens]

16:29.113 --> 16:30.072
[grunts]

16:47.548 --> 16:49.633
[wind blowing]

17:20.539 --> 17:21.623
[Josie grunts]

17:23.876 --> 17:25.127
[gasps]

17:26.295 --> 17:27.921
[chuckles]

17:34.470 --> 17:35.471
[gasping]

17:42.603 --> 17:45.064
[Tunnelman 1] Water pressure's
building in all inflows.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.607
Pressure's in the red.

17:46.690 --> 17:47.691
[Tunnelman 2] Ready the vent.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.529
They're venting.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.364
That's not unusual.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.825
Was Icy Bob trying to disconnect us?

17:57.367 --> 17:58.786
They've slowed down. Why?

17:58.869 --> 18:01.163
For pity's sake.
Why don't you just ask them?

18:03.332 --> 18:04.708
[Bennett] Boki is getting suited up.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.795
Once we free the intake, we'll gradually
bring her back up to speed,

18:07.878 --> 18:09.254
but it's gonna cost us.

18:09.338 --> 18:10.631
We're estimating two hours.

18:10.714 --> 18:14.384
That's two hours later for our rendezvous
with Mel, who we have lost contact with.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.887
Hey, keep the faith.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.932
[Alexandra over radio] Snowpiercer,
<i>it's </i>Big Alice,<i> come in.</i>

18:23.685 --> 18:26.814
Good afternoon, <i>Big Alice.</i>
Probably wondering why we've slowed.

18:26.897 --> 18:30.025
[Alexandra] <i>Yes. We're going to be late</i>
<i>picking up Melanie.</i> <i>What's going on?</i>

18:33.195 --> 18:34.655
Routine maintenance, actually.

18:34.738 --> 18:36.949
<i>We're just</i>
<i>taking advantage</i> <i>of the straight track.</i>

18:37.032 --> 18:37.866
Well, hello, Ben.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.035
<i>Can we be of any assistance?</i>

18:40.119 --> 18:41.036
No, thank you.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.789
We'll be slowing further shortly,
but we'll make it up after that.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.999
<i>All right, then. Every second counts.</i>

18:46.583 --> 18:48.752
Do give my regards
to Mr. Layton, won't you?

18:49.545 --> 18:50.462
[chuckles]

18:52.131 --> 18:53.799
He's in an awful good mood.

18:54.508 --> 18:57.386
-[Javi] Boki's in cold lock.
-[beeps]

18:57.469 --> 18:58.637
All right, ready to roll.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.776
-Boki, do you copy?
-[Boscovic over radio] <i>Copy.</i>

19:12.860 --> 19:14.570
[Javi] He's breached the hatch.
He's on the roof.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.281
<i>When you get to the ladder,</i>
<i>we'll reduce speed.</i>

19:19.658 --> 19:22.494
[Boscovic] Okay.
I'm ready to go over the side.

19:23.036 --> 19:24.037
He's at the intake.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.206
Bringing her down to 55 kilometers.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.334
[breathing heavily]

19:31.920 --> 19:33.046
[Boscovic] I found the block.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.466
How the hell did this get here?

19:36.550 --> 19:37.801
[Javi] Be careful, Boki.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.728
[Boscovic grunting]

19:52.316 --> 19:53.192
<i>I cannot reach it.</i>

19:58.447 --> 20:00.157
Okay, okay…

20:02.409 --> 20:03.702
Okay, shit.

20:03.785 --> 20:04.870
[grunts]

20:04.953 --> 20:06.288
[panting]

20:09.875 --> 20:11.126
[grunts]

20:16.340 --> 20:17.216
[Boscovic panting]

20:17.299 --> 20:18.634
[Javi] Boki, what's happening?

20:20.052 --> 20:21.053
Boki?

20:22.054 --> 20:23.013
[computer beeps]

20:23.096 --> 20:24.348
-[Boscovic] <i>I got it!</i>
-[sighs]

20:24.431 --> 20:25.474
-He's got it.
-[Bennett] Yes!

20:25.557 --> 20:27.267
[Boscovic] I'm coming home!

20:27.851 --> 20:31.230
<i>I'm coming home!</i>

20:31.313 --> 20:32.231
Good work.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.275
-[Boscovic] <i>I'm coming home!</i>
-[Bennett] Let's get him back inside.

20:44.117 --> 20:45.327
[Boscovic] Number ten Wilford.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.954
This was no accident.

20:48.163 --> 20:48.997
How do you know?

20:49.081 --> 20:52.417
The access ladder,
ice was broken off the rungs.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.545
Somebody went down before me.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.676
[whispers] Let's go
check the levels, okay?

21:06.431 --> 21:09.142
[Boscovic] Wilford gave me this himself.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.394
He said,

21:11.270 --> 21:13.563
"Breachmen risk their lives for me."

21:15.148 --> 21:19.444
"With this… I pledge the same to you."

21:24.199 --> 21:25.200
Take it.

21:27.494 --> 21:30.580
Maybe you can shove it
up his ass one day, huh?

21:30.664 --> 21:31.748
[Layton grunts]

21:31.832 --> 21:32.749
Sir.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.088
[Javi] We'll run some tests
in the Engine Server Room.

21:38.171 --> 21:39.589
-What's going on?
-Give us a minute.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.925
-Who… Hey.
-[Javi] I put the train on autopilot.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.219
What's up? Your boy's scaring me.

21:44.803 --> 21:45.637
Follow me.

21:46.805 --> 21:49.808
[LJ] We've pulled up the carpet
and mopped out all the residences.

21:49.891 --> 21:52.936
Now we'll just turn the HVAC
on high and let them all dry out.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.438
You're trying very hard, LJ.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.358
Yeah, we are. For Wilford's train.

21:59.109 --> 22:01.611
So however things fall,
you can count on us.

22:02.446 --> 22:03.864
Nothing's going to fall, LJ.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.200
You just keep up the good work.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.286
Your parents would be very proud.

22:09.369 --> 22:11.872
[LJ] I'm not so sure they would.
I have calluses now.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.375
[sighs] Ruth.

22:16.918 --> 22:18.920
Uh, do you have a second?

22:19.588 --> 22:20.422
Of course.

22:22.466 --> 22:23.425
[Anne sighs]

22:25.886 --> 22:28.722
I just got asked where Sam stands,

22:28.805 --> 22:31.183
with or against Wilford.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.560
Have they knocked on your door yet?

22:34.478 --> 22:35.896
Well, Anne, I, uh…

22:36.688 --> 22:38.774
Hospitality has to remain neutral.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.358
So do the Brakemen.

22:41.610 --> 22:42.527
Is he?

22:48.116 --> 22:49.993
These are very difficult times, Anne.

22:50.994 --> 22:56.041
But I am sure that you and Sam are
strong enough to pull through all of them.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.001
We will muddle through…

22:59.461 --> 23:00.921
just like we always do.

23:15.310 --> 23:18.730
Okay, Chuck, Tony,
get to First Class now. Carefully.

23:18.814 --> 23:21.608
I heard the Wilfordites
might try and blockade Ag-Sec.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.111
Stanley, get your squad
down there right now.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.404
You're gonna have to
run escort on food shuttles.

23:27.030 --> 23:29.741
Boss, we can't even
move through whole sections of Third.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.661
You're gonna have
to work your way around. Use the subtrain.

23:32.744 --> 23:33.703
[Ames] There's a rumor…

23:34.704 --> 23:37.874
that the Jackboots who survived
the Revolution have rebuilt a command.

23:38.458 --> 23:39.459
What?

23:41.962 --> 23:44.756
Well, hello. If it isn't
the prettiest lady on <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

23:44.840 --> 23:47.134
-What are you doing here?
-Sandwiches from the mess.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.635
-Thanks, Anne.
-Thank you.

23:48.718 --> 23:50.720
Guys, stay safe out there.

23:51.513 --> 23:52.681
-[Till] Thanks, Anne.
-Mmm-hmm.

23:54.432 --> 23:55.267
[Roche] What's up?

23:57.352 --> 23:59.646
-That one's for you.
-[Roche] Oh, thank you.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.607
-[Anne] Things are heating up out there.
-Mmm-hmm.

24:02.691 --> 24:05.193
[Anne] You're on top of it,
I have no doubt.

24:07.529 --> 24:09.906
-But I have my own network, Sam.
-[Roche] Mmm-hmm.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.533
-And what I'm getting…
-[Roche] Hmm?

24:12.242 --> 24:14.703
…is there's more against Layton
than there is for him now.

24:16.037 --> 24:19.624
Well, I don't agree
with your split, but… it's close.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.294
You know how bad it can get.

24:23.837 --> 24:25.297
We lost two children.

24:25.380 --> 24:26.923
Okay, that is not happening again.

24:27.007 --> 24:29.217
Then why did you
send our daughter uptrain?

24:30.844 --> 24:33.597
We lived Wilford's way for seven years.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.682
Sam, it was better.

24:36.349 --> 24:39.227
If he's in charge,
he'll set everyone straight.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.938
-Put an end to all--
-At what cost?

24:42.022 --> 24:44.566
-[sighs]
-Anne, you realize, Wilford…

24:45.108 --> 24:47.736
Okay, he designed this train with portals

24:47.819 --> 24:49.529
that freeze people's limbs off.

24:51.448 --> 24:54.201
-Look at what you're asking me.
-To put your family first.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.160
[Roche] I am.

24:55.243 --> 24:56.578
Do you wanna know who Layton is?

24:57.120 --> 24:58.496
Okay? He's a good guy.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.750
And I forgot what a good guy was.

25:03.001 --> 25:07.422
He's trying to give this train,
our daughter, our family,

25:08.089 --> 25:10.091
a world that we can be proud to live in.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.514
If that world falls, I…

25:23.730 --> 25:25.565
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Osweiller] LJ.

25:28.443 --> 25:29.694
What are you doing?

25:29.778 --> 25:31.780
I'm covered in shit and making you dinner.

25:31.863 --> 25:34.199
-What else does it look like I'm doing?
-[Osweiller] Wow.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.911
-Ta-da! Hard-boiled eggs.
-[chuckles]

25:38.870 --> 25:40.038
[chuckles]

25:41.206 --> 25:43.208
-Ooh.
-[chuckles]

25:46.920 --> 25:48.004
You were great today.

25:48.755 --> 25:49.714
-Yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.842
Yeah. Yeah, I was like
some working-class action hero.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.469
[both chuckling]

25:54.552 --> 25:57.138
-Where did that come from?
-I don't know.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.891
But they're treating us with respect now.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.394
Who cares if they like you,
if you're good in a pinch.

26:02.978 --> 26:05.188
I think you're
the only person that likes me.

26:06.731 --> 26:08.984
Well, no. There's Till, right?
She's your friend.

26:09.776 --> 26:11.361
No, we just went through a lot.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.321
Doesn't make us friends.

26:15.282 --> 26:16.491
No, you're my favorite.

26:20.745 --> 26:21.705
I'm your favorite?

26:22.789 --> 26:25.083
Yeah. So?
Don't make fun of me. It just came out.

26:26.543 --> 26:27.711
No, Oz, I'm…

26:30.964 --> 26:32.465
You're my favorite, too.

26:36.219 --> 26:37.637
Dumbass. [chuckles]

26:58.783 --> 27:00.201
[footsteps approaching]

27:00.285 --> 27:02.203
[Bennett] This is the Engine Server Room.

27:06.082 --> 27:08.209
The Engine
still isn't running at full capacity.

27:08.293 --> 27:11.629
But it's self-regulating
as we speak by that.

27:11.713 --> 27:12.714
The Engine's brain.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.092
Wilford Industries'
Digital Automation System.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.928
Sending and receiving
thousands of messages per second.

27:19.012 --> 27:19.846
[engine spluttering]

27:22.932 --> 27:25.101
Our hydrogen input signal
keeps fluctuating.

27:25.185 --> 27:27.729
You ran diagnostics
on the PEMs, it's not that.

27:29.564 --> 27:30.982
Jesus, those numbers are low.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.525
A second ago, they were too high.

27:35.987 --> 27:38.114
[music playing on gramophone]

27:47.415 --> 27:50.168
I can hear your hamsters,
running on their wheel.

27:50.251 --> 27:52.545
Icy Bob made it all the way to the Engine.

27:53.129 --> 27:55.882
He did something to their intake,
that's why they were venting.

27:57.884 --> 27:58.802
Well done.

27:59.386 --> 28:00.220
I knew she'd get it.

28:00.303 --> 28:02.389
And only two steps behind.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.143
-Come on.
-[computer beeping]

28:09.145 --> 28:10.814
[Bennett] It's an amplification error.

28:11.689 --> 28:14.317
The H1 sensor. It's in the intake.

28:14.401 --> 28:16.403
The rail spike
must have made contact with it.

28:16.486 --> 28:18.154
-[Bennett] Shit.
-[Javi] Could've caused an overload.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.163
[sighs] It's fried. Of course.

28:27.247 --> 28:29.374
The sensor misfiring
must've damaged the relay.

28:29.457 --> 28:33.253
It caused control systems to overload.
We can't repair it. We need to replace it.

28:33.336 --> 28:34.504
I'm guessing that's not easy.

28:34.587 --> 28:37.382
This is the Harmonic Module,
Wilford's God Module.

28:37.966 --> 28:41.219
It's responsible for hydrogen production
which powers the Engine.

28:41.302 --> 28:43.304
If this thing is malfunctioning,

28:43.388 --> 28:45.014
the entire Engine will collapse.

28:46.141 --> 28:48.977
It's relatively easy to replace.
We just don't have another one.

28:49.686 --> 28:50.937
I bet I know who does.

28:52.564 --> 28:55.108
They fixed their intake.
You must have known that they could.

28:55.191 --> 28:57.402
They're back at normal speed, so what now?

28:57.485 --> 28:59.821
I imagine it would start
with a phone call, hmm?

29:00.447 --> 29:02.073
-[radio dings]
-Oh! There it is.

29:02.157 --> 29:05.160
[Bennett] Big Alice, Big Alice,
<i>we have an emergency.</i>

29:06.536 --> 29:07.579
Splendid, darling.

29:07.662 --> 29:08.538
Bravo.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.918
You're starting to see it now, aren't you?

29:19.048 --> 29:22.677
You mean to say that
exploding waterlines are Wilford's doing?

29:22.761 --> 29:24.763
He caused this crisis on purpose?

29:24.846 --> 29:27.140
That is exactly what I mean to say, yes.

29:27.223 --> 29:28.892
He's sabotaging his own Engine?

29:28.975 --> 29:31.436
Doesn't matter that he caused it.
He is our only way out.

29:31.519 --> 29:33.229
We know it, so does he.

29:33.313 --> 29:36.566
Wilford has a replacement God Module,
but he comes with it.

29:36.649 --> 29:39.652
We have about two hours
to get our Engine systems back online.

29:39.736 --> 29:43.072
Without Wilford's help,
it's the end of all of us by morning.

29:44.115 --> 29:48.369
What happens when his supporters find out
that he's in the Engine saving the day?

29:48.453 --> 29:50.622
Sparks will fly. Guarantee it.

29:50.705 --> 29:51.790
Nobody finds out.

29:52.332 --> 29:53.333
We can contain him.

29:53.416 --> 29:54.626
He agreed to come alone,

29:54.709 --> 29:56.669
so we clear the route
and bring him up secretly.

29:56.753 --> 29:59.214
We'll make sure
no one will ever know he was here.

29:59.297 --> 30:00.590
And then what will he do?

30:01.841 --> 30:02.759
Andre,

30:03.343 --> 30:05.011
you're letting him in the Engine.

30:05.595 --> 30:10.683
Look, we all know that Wilford
is crazy enough to gamble everything.

30:11.434 --> 30:14.479
Our return to Melanie, both trains,

30:14.562 --> 30:16.356
the future of life as we know it.

30:18.441 --> 30:22.028
But we don't have another choice,
and I need you all to get on board.

30:22.111 --> 30:24.364
I'll have eyes on Wilford the entire time.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.492
And what if it all goes to shit?

30:29.369 --> 30:30.995
If it all goes to shit, you'll know.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.039
I'll send up a flare.

30:35.917 --> 30:36.835
We have to go.

30:38.211 --> 30:39.295
Roche, Ruth.

30:54.644 --> 30:55.520
Huh…

30:56.437 --> 30:57.814
Awfully quiet in here.

30:58.439 --> 31:00.191
I must be quite popular

31:00.275 --> 31:02.277
if you don't want anyone to see me.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.403
We're taking you uptrain.

31:03.486 --> 31:05.822
You'll be watched carefully
while you replace the part.

31:09.242 --> 31:10.660
Right this way, Mr. Wilford.

31:12.120 --> 31:15.748
Pity there's no one here
to witness this historic occasion.

31:15.832 --> 31:16.749
Eh, Roche?

31:18.001 --> 31:19.210
[chuckles]

31:26.175 --> 31:27.552
-You in?
-[Roche] We're in.

31:31.806 --> 31:33.641
[laughs]

32:00.043 --> 32:00.877
[chuckles]

32:01.794 --> 32:02.629
Forgive me.

32:03.296 --> 32:05.173
-[door beeps]
-I'm sentimental.

32:08.134 --> 32:09.218
Ben…

32:09.928 --> 32:12.972
Here to ruin the moment, as per usual.

32:17.060 --> 32:18.394
After you, Mr. Wilford.

32:19.479 --> 32:20.855
Why, thank you, Mr. Layton.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.695
[sighs]

32:27.779 --> 32:29.948
Uh, this is where we leave you.

32:30.031 --> 32:32.575
[Wilford] Ah,
until we meet again then, Ruth.

32:33.868 --> 32:34.702
And, Roche,

32:35.244 --> 32:38.498
you hold the balance of power
with wisdom and aplomb.

32:39.457 --> 32:40.541
I hope that lasts.

32:53.179 --> 32:55.932
Hello, old girl. [chuckles]

32:56.724 --> 32:57.725
[sighs]

32:58.559 --> 33:00.520
-Javier.
-Mr. Wilford.

33:00.603 --> 33:02.230
I heard a funny story about you.

33:02.313 --> 33:05.024
Is it true you were in the bathroom
when Melanie stole the train?

33:05.108 --> 33:07.110
Caught with my pants down, yes, sir.

33:07.193 --> 33:08.194
[laughs]

33:09.195 --> 33:11.322
Briefcase. Please.

33:12.115 --> 33:13.282
I'll give it to Javi.

33:14.033 --> 33:15.034
I like him.

33:26.838 --> 33:30.091
You'll want to replace the ribbon
connecting it to the H1 sensor.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.968
Hey, you can watch from here.

33:32.552 --> 33:33.678
Uh-huh.

33:35.096 --> 33:37.390
Wilford's on <i>Snowpiercer.</i>
I saw him myself.

33:37.473 --> 33:40.018
-We think he's in the Engine.
-So let's keep him there.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.853
We nearly match the Tail army's numbers.

33:41.936 --> 33:44.147
People want us to step up,
now's our chance.

33:44.230 --> 33:47.066
Without me, your Engine
would die on you in less than an hour.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.402
You risked taking it this far
for a publicity stunt.

33:49.485 --> 33:52.030
[Wilford] No. To see old friends.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.574
To see you again. It's been too long.

33:56.451 --> 33:58.119
I'm too big to keep secret.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.955
Sooner or later,
they'll know I was here, saving the day.

34:01.998 --> 34:04.500
Make sure you reset the intake sensor.

34:04.584 --> 34:05.460
Already have.

34:05.543 --> 34:06.377
I think they got it.

34:07.086 --> 34:07.920
How would you know?

34:08.004 --> 34:10.048
Guys, can we focus, please?

34:10.631 --> 34:12.842
Module's connected.
Ready to recalibrate CPU.

34:14.677 --> 34:15.553
Ready to power.

34:15.636 --> 34:17.680
[Javi] All right. Systems looks good.

34:17.764 --> 34:20.600
-It's online. Processing input.
-[beeps]

34:20.683 --> 34:22.518
Shit. It's overloading!

34:24.187 --> 34:27.023
[Wilford] Disconnect it!

34:31.861 --> 34:33.654
What the hell have you done to my Engine?

34:34.655 --> 34:38.117
Melanie retrofitted the bogie motor
circuitry during our fifth Revolution.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.452
To override automation.

34:40.286 --> 34:41.746
Because of Melanie's hack,

34:41.829 --> 34:44.791
my God Module can't override the system.

34:44.874 --> 34:47.293
All hydrogen production is suspended.

34:47.376 --> 34:51.297
We have minutes
before the entire Engine will fail!

34:51.380 --> 34:54.217
We let you in the Engine! Fix it!

34:54.801 --> 34:57.011
Guys, we're down to 14%.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.055
[Layton] We can't just
disconnect Melanie's hack?

34:59.138 --> 35:00.723
[Javi] No.
It's connected to the bogie motors.

35:00.807 --> 35:03.768
[Bennett] We don't have
the energy reserves to restart them.

35:04.977 --> 35:05.895
<i>Big Alice.</i>

35:07.021 --> 35:08.356
<i>Big Alice</i> can push.

35:09.357 --> 35:12.151
We'll manually disengage the bogie motors

35:12.235 --> 35:14.237
so she can push with less resistance.

35:14.904 --> 35:15.988
Do an emergency shutdown.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.156
Shut down the Engine?

35:17.240 --> 35:19.909
Yes. Rewire the circuitry,

35:19.992 --> 35:22.662
and jumpstart her
while we still have enough speed.

35:22.745 --> 35:25.123
That's over 200 manual shutdowns.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.416
And we don't even know
if it'll start back up again.

35:28.584 --> 35:29.544
[Bennett] I'm on it.

35:34.340 --> 35:35.216
[PA system chimes]

35:35.299 --> 35:38.219
[Bennett on PA] Snowpiercer,
<i>this is</i> <i>a level five emergency…</i>

35:38.302 --> 35:41.055
-Let's go! Five-point-five.
<i>-All departments report to stations.</i>

35:41.139 --> 35:42.014
Move!

35:42.098 --> 35:44.225
[Bennett] <i>Crews one through eight</i>
<i>to subtrain positions.</i>

35:44.308 --> 35:46.435
<i>This is a Manual Restart protocol.</i>

35:46.519 --> 35:49.230
Restart. I repeat, Restart. Restart.

35:59.365 --> 36:00.408
[Zarah] Get out of the way!

36:00.491 --> 36:01.784
What the hell's happened?

36:01.868 --> 36:05.329
A manual restart?
That's never been done before.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.540
-Have you heard anything from Andre?
-[Roche] No.

36:08.708 --> 36:10.251
[Till] Word got out Wilford is uptrain.

36:10.334 --> 36:12.253
His supporters
are mobilizing to keep him here.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.297
<i>Big Alice,</i> did you hear what I said?

36:14.380 --> 36:16.924
Yes, you're powering down <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

36:17.008 --> 36:17.842
All of her?

36:17.925 --> 36:19.719
<i>-Is this a part of your plan?</i>
-No!

36:19.802 --> 36:21.929
<i>When we disengage the bogies,</i>

36:22.013 --> 36:23.055
we need you to push.

36:23.139 --> 36:26.392
We can't go below terminal
or the jumpstart won't work.

36:26.475 --> 36:28.978
We'll only have
three minutes before we hit critical.

36:29.061 --> 36:29.979
Just under.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.317
Okay. [sighs]

36:34.400 --> 36:35.943
Okay, I'll try. I'll push.

36:36.736 --> 36:38.279
Engage level three shutdown.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.866
[Javi] Disengaging hydrogen compressors.

36:42.825 --> 36:44.702
<i>Restricting hydrogen electrolysis.</i>

36:45.661 --> 36:47.246

36:47.330 --> 36:53.044

36:55.963 --> 36:57.256

37:27.453 --> 37:28.537
So quiet.

37:29.747 --> 37:30.748
[man] What's happening?

37:30.831 --> 37:31.958
[indistinct chatter]

37:35.169 --> 37:37.672
-You about ready, Javier?
-Almost.

37:37.755 --> 37:40.424
You're good, Javi. Just tune it all out.
It's just me and you here.

37:40.508 --> 37:43.427
[Wilford] Come on, what's the holdup?
Seize the moment, Javi.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.972
-[Javi groans]
-You're too slow.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.682
Can you do it, Layton? No.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.517
You're not an Engineer.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.352
How can you expect to lead this train?

37:52.061 --> 37:54.063
You don't even understand how it works.

37:56.399 --> 37:57.233
There.

38:05.491 --> 38:06.784
-[PA system chimes]

<i>Hold fast now.</i>

42:12.738 --> 42:14.073
I survived that once.

42:18.869 --> 42:20.871
I promised the Tailies their freedom.

42:22.081 --> 42:23.958
Told them that I would protect them.

I will do what I can to help the Tail.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.066
You don't give up.

43:32.401 --> 43:33.485
You understand me?

43:36.071 --> 43:37.281
We don't give up.

43:49.043 --> 43:49.918
Good luck.

43:50.002 --> 43:51.128
You, too, Roche.

43:52.755 --> 43:54.715
You're to report to Wilford on <i>Big Alice.</i>

43:55.299 --> 43:56.175
Got it.

44:04.350 --> 44:05.309
You're my escort?

44:05.392 --> 44:06.560
Yes.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.437
You made the right decision.

44:08.520 --> 44:10.898
Joseph's upstairs. I'll show you the way.

44:36.799 --> 44:37.841
Come.

44:56.819 --> 44:57.986
[sighs]

45:16.463 --> 45:17.631
Mr. Wilford.

45:20.676 --> 45:22.761
You have the train.
