00:00.166 --> 00:01.651
<i>Previously on</i> Mike & Molly...

00:01.652 --> 00:04.077
Mike, I was writing.
You're always writing.

00:04.078 --> 00:07.028
That's true. I come home
from drinking, you're writing.

00:07.029 --> 00:09.129
I get up to smoke a bowl,
you're writing.

00:10.265 --> 00:12.533
Honey, you have
a serious problem.

00:13.468 --> 00:16.303
There, done.
What'd you do?

00:16.305 --> 00:18.306
I did what you should have done
a couple of weeks ago.

00:18.307 --> 00:19.707
I sent your book
to your publisher.

00:19.708 --> 00:21.308
You're welcome.

00:21.310 --> 00:24.045
You actually sent it?! Why would
you do something like that?!

00:24.046 --> 00:26.047
Oh, my God!

00:26.048 --> 00:27.514
Know what this is?

00:27.516 --> 00:30.484
This is your face.

00:33.621 --> 00:35.055
Come on!

00:35.057 --> 00:36.691
What is going on with you?

00:36.692 --> 00:39.893
Your whole life, you've always
finished what you've started.

00:39.895 --> 00:41.062
This is different.

00:41.063 --> 00:42.096
It's my first book.

00:42.097 --> 00:43.498
That's a very big deal.

00:43.499 --> 00:45.233
And if they don't like it,
it's over.

00:45.234 --> 00:47.434
My career is done.

00:53.741 --> 00:55.676
Wow.

00:55.677 --> 00:58.378
Who knew publishers
were so fancy?

00:58.380 --> 00:59.714
I'm not sure why I'm whispering.

00:59.715 --> 01:01.782
Maybe it's the art
or the-the sculpture

01:01.783 --> 01:04.084
or the fact that you
haven't spoken to me

01:04.086 --> 01:06.619
to kind of set a level.

01:06.621 --> 01:09.556
Mr. Van Xander
will be right with you.

01:09.558 --> 01:11.124
Okay, so inside voices.

01:13.060 --> 01:14.462
Okay.

01:14.463 --> 01:16.764
He didn't happen to mention
what he thought of my book?

01:16.765 --> 01:19.166
I mean, I know that's
kind of awkward for you,

01:19.167 --> 01:21.401
but this is already so awkward.

01:23.370 --> 01:24.705
Would you like some water?

01:24.706 --> 01:27.307
Yes, I would.

01:27.309 --> 01:31.412
And, uh, if one had
the-the urge to throw up,

01:31.413 --> 01:34.147
where would one do that?

01:35.716 --> 01:36.849
Oh.

01:36.851 --> 01:39.153
Not much of a talker, are you?

01:39.154 --> 01:40.688
Oh.
(laughs)

01:40.689 --> 01:44.124
Is this a trick, or
do I just kind of...

01:44.125 --> 01:47.428
Maybe I'll... maybe I'll crack
it like a coconut. (laughs)

01:47.429 --> 01:49.629
(laughing trails off)

01:54.268 --> 01:56.502
Oh. Oh.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:07.047 --> 02:10.181
That's... that's tough.

02:22.462 --> 02:23.830
I love it.

02:23.831 --> 02:24.965
And I love you.

02:24.966 --> 02:29.002
Oh, and I love
that you love me, too.

02:29.003 --> 02:30.270
(chuckles nervously)

02:30.271 --> 02:32.404
So what are your plans?

02:32.406 --> 02:34.974
Well, right off the bat,
I want to change my pants.

02:36.810 --> 02:38.778
I mean for your future,

02:38.779 --> 02:40.780
because this, my dear,
is a game changer.

02:40.781 --> 02:42.915
Books like yours don't come
across my desk every day.

02:42.917 --> 02:46.586
I think what we have here
is very nearly perfect.

02:46.587 --> 02:48.187
I really only have one thought.

02:48.189 --> 02:50.089
One thought? Great.

02:50.091 --> 02:52.425
Well, as you have it,
your main character is searching

02:52.426 --> 02:55.395
for spiritual fulfillment
and sexual awakening,

02:55.396 --> 02:56.729
which I love...

02:56.730 --> 02:57.964
Me, too.

02:57.965 --> 02:59.666
I mean, it's internal,
but it's universal.

02:59.667 --> 03:01.934
I mean, it's really the whole
reason I wrote the book.

03:01.936 --> 03:04.703
Mm-hmm, but what if,
instead of all that,

03:04.705 --> 03:09.908
every time she orgasms,
she travels through time?

03:15.148 --> 03:16.982
What?

03:16.984 --> 03:18.651
I mean, think of
it... she would have

03:18.652 --> 03:20.453
to seduce famous
historical figures

03:20.454 --> 03:24.923
in order to climax her way
back to her one true love.

03:24.925 --> 03:26.659
Wow.
(chuckles)

03:26.660 --> 03:27.994
It's, uh, it's...

03:27.995 --> 03:30.195
That's... Wow.

03:31.597 --> 03:33.332
I don't...
I don't know how to...

03:33.333 --> 03:35.268
Wow, but I...

03:35.269 --> 03:37.302
I thought you liked
what I wrote.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.704
Oh, I loved what you wrote.

03:38.705 --> 03:40.339
But now, with my
one little tweak,

03:40.340 --> 03:41.641
we're not talking best seller;

03:41.642 --> 03:44.542
we're talking phenomenon.

03:44.544 --> 03:46.378
Phenomenon, okay.

03:46.380 --> 03:47.647
Phenomenon.

03:47.648 --> 03:49.682
That's a TV series,
movie trilogy

03:49.683 --> 03:52.385
and, if done right, a
very erotic 3-D ride

03:52.386 --> 03:54.252
at Universal Studios.

03:56.155 --> 03:57.656
I hope I'm tall enough.

He said, "We're not

04:41.797 --> 04:42.930

Oh, you will.

04:56.311 --> 04:58.146
I sent the right kid to college.

I basically have to write
a whole new book.

05:11.326 --> 05:13.660
Oh, just change
some names and locations.

05:13.662 --> 05:15.596
Yeah, turn panties
into pantaloons,

05:15.597 --> 05:17.331
make it a "ye olde ball gag,"

05:17.332 --> 05:18.665
and you're good to go.

05:20.768 --> 05:23.137
I cannot tell you how
proud of you I am.

05:23.138 --> 05:24.438
And look at me, I'm dancing.

05:24.439 --> 05:25.773
I haven't danced since '86

05:25.774 --> 05:27.974
when the Bears won
the Super Bowl.

05:27.976 --> 05:29.709
I know, you didn't even
dance at our wedding.

05:29.711 --> 05:31.212
Well, I'm dancing now, baby.

05:31.213 --> 05:32.112
Say it.

Now that you're married
to a soon-to-be phenomenon,

05:45.961 --> 05:48.194
you got to have a look.
MIKE: I already got one.

05:48.196 --> 05:51.198
No, what you have is
a look-away.

05:51.199 --> 05:52.333
Try on the gabardines.

05:52.334 --> 05:53.734
The hell's a gabardine?

05:53.735 --> 05:54.702
A shirt? A belt?

05:54.703 --> 05:56.103
Speak English.

05:56.104 --> 05:58.372
You know, you're gonna have to
learn these high-fashion terms

05:58.373 --> 06:00.374
if you're gonna be walking a red
carpet with your famous wife.

06:00.375 --> 06:02.643
Yeah, when they ask you,
"Who are you wearing""

06:02.644 --> 06:04.977
you don't want to say,
"OshKosh B'gosh""

06:10.484 --> 06:12.552
Oh, my B'gosh.

06:12.554 --> 06:14.821
What do you think?

06:14.822 --> 06:17.790
You got a lot
going on there, man.

06:19.226 --> 06:21.060
Cowboy boots, leather jacket.

06:21.062 --> 06:23.130
With an Indian headdress, you
could be all the Village People

06:23.131 --> 06:24.530
wrapped up in one.

06:24.532 --> 06:27.501
I'm not used to putting together
outfits, okay?

06:27.502 --> 06:29.236
When I go shopping,
it's usually for one thing.

06:29.237 --> 06:30.537
And I try it on in the aisle,

06:30.538 --> 06:33.039
over my clothes,
like a normal guy.

06:33.041 --> 06:34.841
Well, those days
are long gone, all right?

06:34.842 --> 06:36.610
You know, you're not plain old
Mike Biggs anymore.

06:36.611 --> 06:37.744
You're Mr. Molly Flynn,

06:37.745 --> 06:39.546
the well dressed symbol
of her success.

06:39.547 --> 06:40.913
Yeah, it's true.

06:40.915 --> 06:44.918
Behind every great man is a
woman who spends all his money.

06:44.919 --> 06:47.253
Are you man enough
to be that woman?

06:48.255 --> 06:50.356
You know what, I might be.

06:51.691 --> 06:53.826
You'll be the Stedman
to her Oprah.

06:53.828 --> 06:55.928
I wonder if he shops here.

06:55.930 --> 06:58.197
Hell no, man, we're in Mervyns.

07:02.836 --> 07:04.471
Here you go.

07:04.472 --> 07:06.439
This usually helps me think.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.174
Hot Dr Pepper and lemon.

07:08.175 --> 07:09.675
Oh.

07:09.677 --> 07:11.478
Luckily, I will not
be needing that,

07:11.479 --> 07:13.112
because, as you can see
by my board,

07:13.113 --> 07:16.381
I have figured out this whole
time-travel direction change.

07:18.117 --> 07:20.320
My crazy cousin had
a wall just like this,

07:20.321 --> 07:23.722
except it was all
about Bernadette Peters.

07:23.724 --> 07:24.924
All right, I-I get it.

07:24.925 --> 07:26.693
It's a... it's a bit of a mess.

07:26.694 --> 07:28.428
But, you know,
it all really makes sense

07:28.429 --> 07:30.430
if you just follow the yarn.
I mean, her...

07:30.431 --> 07:32.832
Okay, the green yarn is
for her emotional journey.

07:32.833 --> 07:35.334
The blue is for when she's going
back into the past.

07:35.335 --> 07:37.804
The yellow is when she's
launching into the future.

07:37.805 --> 07:39.405
And the red,
the red is very good

07:39.406 --> 07:41.974
'cause the red is
the parallel journey

07:41.975 --> 07:43.976
that her lover is taking,
but in the present.

07:43.977 --> 07:46.578
So... I mean,
it's very easy-peasy, really.

07:47.847 --> 07:49.382
One question.
Yeah.

07:49.383 --> 07:51.316
Is that my good yarn?

07:51.318 --> 07:54.053
Yes, although I-I did not know
there was such a thing

07:54.054 --> 07:55.820
as good yarn.

07:55.822 --> 07:59.190
Why is she slutting
her way through time anyway?

07:59.192 --> 08:02.294
Because she's trying to get back
to her one true love.

08:02.296 --> 08:03.462
So when she goes back,

08:03.463 --> 08:05.930
will she time-travel
orgasm with him,

08:05.932 --> 08:08.034
or just fake it
for the rest of her life?

08:08.035 --> 08:09.969
'Cause I've lived
that book with Mike's dad.

08:09.970 --> 08:12.404
It's a very dry read.

08:13.439 --> 08:15.841
I don't know.
I haven't gotten that far yet.

08:15.842 --> 08:19.644
I-I think I'm gonna need
some more yarn.

08:19.646 --> 08:21.647
And does any orgasm do it?

08:21.648 --> 08:23.949
Say she backs herself
onto a Jacuzzi jet...

08:23.950 --> 08:25.451
where does that send her?

08:25.452 --> 08:26.718
Ew, Peggy.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.755
Hey, this is your
cockamamy story.

08:29.756 --> 08:32.390
Not that my opinion matters,
but I like what you had.

08:32.392 --> 08:34.760
It was good writing,
and it made sense.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.660
(sighs) Well, I did, too.

08:36.663 --> 08:38.664
But apparently you're not
supposed to have any of that

08:38.664 --> 08:41.033
if you're trying
to make a phenomenon.

08:41.034 --> 08:42.299
Well, good luck.

08:42.302 --> 08:44.269
I'm gonna go take a bath.

08:44.270 --> 08:46.672
If I disappear,
don't use my good yarn

08:46.673 --> 08:48.806
to come looking for me.

08:51.009 --> 08:52.311
Eh, what do you think?

08:52.312 --> 08:55.981
Hand-stitched calf leather,
limited-edition Brando cut.

08:55.982 --> 08:57.114
Wow.

08:57.116 --> 08:59.884
You're a regular rebel
without a treadmill.

09:03.388 --> 09:05.456
Well, how do you like me now?

09:06.358 --> 09:09.994
I'd love to mock you, but, damn
it, you can pull off a hat.

09:11.329 --> 09:13.365
MIKE: Hey, what are you
doing home so early?

09:13.366 --> 09:14.832
What are you wearing?

09:14.834 --> 09:15.867
Not what, who.

09:15.868 --> 09:18.135
Mervyn.

09:18.937 --> 09:20.972
Why does everything
have to change?

09:20.973 --> 09:22.974
Well, because Carl said
my old clothes looked

09:22.975 --> 09:25.277
like a Goodwill bin
threw up on me.

09:25.278 --> 09:27.445
Mike, if there's anything
I've learned today,

09:27.446 --> 09:29.080
it's to be true to yourself.

09:29.081 --> 09:31.082
And you don't have
to listen to other people.

09:31.083 --> 09:32.617
Those other people's
good ideas can...

09:32.618 --> 09:36.288
might just have you looking
like a big, crazy mess.

09:36.289 --> 09:38.489
But the hat works, right?

09:40.158 --> 09:41.626
Boy, is that a one-way street.

09:41.627 --> 09:43.461
You know, when she wears
something I don't like,

09:43.462 --> 09:45.763
I lie and go, "I love it."

09:45.765 --> 09:47.364
What'd you say?

09:47.366 --> 09:49.266
You are beautiful.

09:56.441 --> 09:58.643
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

09:58.644 --> 10:01.946
Of course! Anything for
my new favorite author.

10:01.947 --> 10:03.114
So, what's on your mind?

10:03.115 --> 10:04.816
Other than brilliant thoughts.

10:04.817 --> 10:06.484
(laughs): Oh, yeah.

10:06.485 --> 10:07.685
Those little suckers are having

10:07.686 --> 10:10.587
quite a wrestling match
up there.

10:10.589 --> 10:12.923
That sounds exciting.

10:12.925 --> 10:14.692
Oh, it's not.

10:14.693 --> 10:16.661
Uh... remember that idea you had

10:16.662 --> 10:19.996
about adding time travel
into my book?

10:19.998 --> 10:21.765
Not "book." Phenomenon.

10:21.767 --> 10:24.602
Oh, yeah, but it...
still has to be a book.

10:24.603 --> 10:26.370
(laughs)

10:26.371 --> 10:28.306
I, uh, eh...
I've been trying to wedge

10:28.307 --> 10:29.807
that bugger of a note in there.

10:29.808 --> 10:31.209
And I'm realizing

10:31.210 --> 10:33.311
that it's kind of unraveling
all the wonderful stuff

10:33.312 --> 10:35.645
I had written originally.

10:35.647 --> 10:36.914
Really? It's just one note.

10:36.915 --> 10:37.948
Yeah.

10:37.949 --> 10:40.483
That changes everything.

10:40.485 --> 10:41.719
Then what are you
sitting here for?

10:41.720 --> 10:43.454
You've got a lot of work to do.

10:43.455 --> 10:45.289
Oh. Yeah.

10:45.290 --> 10:46.457
Um... look.

10:46.458 --> 10:49.560
I-I appreciate everything
you're doing for me,

10:49.561 --> 10:52.062
but I don't think
I'm the person to write this.

10:52.063 --> 10:54.331
I... This should be
in the hands of somebody

10:54.332 --> 10:58.803
that shares your passion
and-and has a lot more yarn

10:58.804 --> 11:01.604
than I have.

11:01.606 --> 11:04.440
Well, I believe
you are that person.

11:04.442 --> 11:05.509
Oh.

11:05.510 --> 11:08.645
And I believe I am not.

11:09.947 --> 11:12.916
Well, I am so sorry if I led you

11:12.917 --> 11:16.953
to believe for one moment
that you had a choice.

11:16.955 --> 11:18.455
What?

11:18.456 --> 11:20.923
I own you.

11:20.925 --> 11:22.726
Bought and paid for.
Now, I don't want

11:22.727 --> 11:24.828
to hear another word
or see you here again

11:24.829 --> 11:27.064
until your character
has shagged her way

11:27.065 --> 11:28.865
to Fred Flintstone and back!

11:28.867 --> 11:30.032
(stammering)

11:30.034 --> 11:30.834
Make it work!

11:30.835 --> 11:33.669
Your time's up.
Ooh.

11:34.871 --> 11:38.107
Could I get, uh,
one of those balls of water?

11:38.109 --> 11:40.109
(clears her throat)

11:47.317 --> 11:50.787
Get my parking valid...

11:50.788 --> 11:52.788
I'll just keep it.

11:55.158 --> 11:57.326
I got it.

12:04.417 --> 12:06.651
Hey, how'd it go
with the publisher?

12:10.022 --> 12:11.924
Not so great, huh?

12:11.925 --> 12:13.459
He said he owned me.

12:13.460 --> 12:14.860
Yeah. You believe that?

12:14.861 --> 12:16.428
He owned me!

12:16.429 --> 12:17.796
Well, he can't say that.

12:17.797 --> 12:19.798
Well, he can and he does.

12:19.799 --> 12:21.567
As long as he's still paying me,

12:21.568 --> 12:23.902
I'm just his little
typing monkey.

12:23.903 --> 12:25.404
Ha!

12:25.405 --> 12:27.004
What is so funny?

12:27.006 --> 12:30.274
Oh... I was just picturing
a little typing monkey.

12:31.176 --> 12:33.178
I'm an idiot!
I mean, what did I think

12:33.179 --> 12:35.546
being a working writer
was gonna be like?

12:35.548 --> 12:37.149
Well, you did buy that beret.

12:37.150 --> 12:38.550
I know.

12:38.551 --> 12:41.887
I ju... I really did think it
was gonna be deep conversations

12:41.888 --> 12:45.424
and, you know, Paris cafés
and drinking absinthe

12:45.425 --> 12:48.260
with other Hemingway wannabes.

12:48.261 --> 12:49.861
Instead you're
sitting on a couch

12:49.862 --> 12:52.597
drinking a beer
with the real deal Mike Biggs.

12:53.732 --> 12:56.968
Not that I don't love you,
but exactly.

12:56.969 --> 12:58.170
If it makes you feel any better,

12:58.171 --> 12:59.938
I had that same
kind of wakeup call

12:59.939 --> 13:01.440
when I first joined the force.

13:01.441 --> 13:03.141
It was nothing like the movies.

13:03.142 --> 13:04.675
What did you want?
Like a <i> French Connection?</i>

13:04.677 --> 13:06.711
No.<i> Police Academy.</i>

13:06.712 --> 13:10.080
Those guys were hilarious
and great at their job.

13:10.082 --> 13:11.716
You know who had it made?

13:11.717 --> 13:13.785
Angela Lansbury.

13:13.786 --> 13:15.686
The old lady
from <i> Murder, She Wrote?</i>

13:15.688 --> 13:17.155
Uh, yeah.

13:17.156 --> 13:19.024
She rode her bike
all over Maine.

13:19.025 --> 13:20.358
She only wrote during the day.

13:20.359 --> 13:21.660
Solved mysteries at night.

13:21.661 --> 13:24.628
God, she had it figured out!

13:25.430 --> 13:27.666
So, what are you gonna do?

13:27.667 --> 13:30.401
First, I'm gonna
finish your beer.

13:30.403 --> 13:33.270
And probably any others
that are left in the house.

13:34.672 --> 13:36.641
Then I'm gonna do what
everybody else with a job does.

13:36.642 --> 13:38.743
I'm gonna suck it up.
I'm gonna do the work.

13:38.744 --> 13:39.977
All right.

13:39.979 --> 13:42.080
But know that if you do
decide to quit,

13:42.081 --> 13:44.649
all my fancy new duds
can go back to Mervyns.

13:44.650 --> 13:46.216
Except the hat.

13:46.218 --> 13:48.185
Aw, you love your hat.

13:48.187 --> 13:49.587
I do. But more importantly,

13:49.588 --> 13:51.990
you know that weird sweat ring
I leave on my pillowcase?

13:51.991 --> 13:54.057
The same thing happened
in the fedora.

14:00.431 --> 14:02.567
All right, all right.

14:02.568 --> 14:03.735
Here we go.

14:03.736 --> 14:05.369
We got this.

14:05.370 --> 14:07.705
Mm-hmm.

14:07.706 --> 14:09.173
Got that. Okay.

14:09.174 --> 14:12.742
Just plug my nose
and dive right in.

14:13.644 --> 14:20.584
She closed her eyes in
ecstasy and awoke in...

14:20.586 --> 14:22.386
Uh, the rope went down...

14:22.387 --> 14:26.056
Oh... 1776!

14:26.058 --> 14:28.359
Okay, 1776 it is!

14:28.360 --> 14:34.532
1776... In the distance,
she heard the town crier.

14:34.533 --> 14:36.417
Hear ye.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.136
Hear ye!

14:43.808 --> 14:44.942
Mr. Franklin!

14:44.943 --> 14:47.877
Mr. Benjamin Franklin!

14:47.879 --> 14:49.445
At your service.
Please.

14:49.447 --> 14:50.748
Don't be frightened.

14:50.749 --> 14:51.949
And I know this may sound odd,

14:51.950 --> 14:54.385
but I need to tell you
that I'm from...

14:54.386 --> 14:56.219
from the future.

14:56.221 --> 14:59.156
Now, I'm sure that this
scares you to your core,

14:59.157 --> 15:01.625
but you need to understand
that I'm not here to harm you.

15:01.626 --> 15:04.395
In fact, I'm here
to make love to you.

15:04.396 --> 15:07.364
And when we do it,
we need to do it well.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.033
So well, in fact,
that our lovemaking

15:09.034 --> 15:11.035
will send me forward
into the future.

15:11.036 --> 15:16.072
Exactly 238 years into the
arms of my one true love.

15:17.207 --> 15:19.609
All right, let's get rutting.

15:19.611 --> 15:21.845
Wait, wait. You're one
of history's greatest scholars,

15:21.846 --> 15:24.381
a scientist and a statesman.

15:24.382 --> 15:25.982
You're just gonna buy into this?

15:25.984 --> 15:27.284
Hey, don't look at me, lady.

15:27.285 --> 15:29.719
You're the one writing
this horse crap.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.588
Just shut up
and take off your pants.

15:33.757 --> 15:35.391
(groans)

15:39.329 --> 15:41.964
Molly?

15:41.966 --> 15:45.401
Use your fingers.

15:55.966 --> 15:58.502
So, how's our
sexy sci-fi coming?

15:58.503 --> 16:01.971
Oh, chug, chug, chugging along.

16:01.973 --> 16:03.707
(chuckles) Well, good.

16:03.708 --> 16:06.143
Just know this... your whole
world is about to change.

16:06.144 --> 16:08.178
You won't be able to
walk down the street

16:08.179 --> 16:09.613
without someone
pointing and saying,

16:09.614 --> 16:11.248
"There's the <i>Timegasm</i> lady""

16:11.249 --> 16:12.716
Ah!

16:12.717 --> 16:15.952
And that's the thought
that keeps me up at night.

16:15.953 --> 16:20.190
Oh... but, you know, but I...
I am having a bit of a dilemma.

16:20.191 --> 16:23.860
And you're the smartest person
that I know,

16:23.861 --> 16:26.396
so I've...
I've come to you for help.

16:26.397 --> 16:28.198
Ah, they all do.

16:28.199 --> 16:29.533
Oh.

16:29.534 --> 16:30.766
It's in the writing.

16:30.768 --> 16:32.535
Mm-hmm.
I've... I've come across

16:32.536 --> 16:35.205
this character...
brilliant man, handsome.

16:35.206 --> 16:36.873
I mean, almost beautiful.

16:36.874 --> 16:39.509
Uh, born in England,
studied at Oxford.

16:39.510 --> 16:41.578
As did I.

16:41.579 --> 16:42.911
No, you didn't.

16:42.913 --> 16:44.581
Yes.
No, you didn't!

16:44.582 --> 16:45.647
Yes.
Oh, my!

16:45.649 --> 16:46.816
That's... Gah!

16:46.817 --> 16:48.852
That's crazy. I, uh...

16:48.853 --> 16:50.186
You know what?
It's funny.

16:50.187 --> 16:51.688
'Cause now that you say that,

16:51.689 --> 16:53.723
and I'm looking at you
and thinking about him,

16:53.724 --> 16:55.859
I'm... You are very similar.

16:55.860 --> 16:57.093
You're very well put together.

16:57.094 --> 16:58.995
Very self-assured.

16:58.996 --> 17:00.697
Is he tall?

17:00.698 --> 17:01.931
Oh! Yeah, I mean, yeah,

17:01.932 --> 17:04.199
he's got to be six...
what are you?

17:04.201 --> 17:06.102
Six-five.
Six... five!

17:06.103 --> 17:07.368
Wow, so is he!

17:07.371 --> 17:08.637
I love it!
Tell me more.

17:08.638 --> 17:11.007
Oh, well, what
can I say?

17:11.008 --> 17:12.842
I mean, every man wants him.

17:12.843 --> 17:14.542
Every woman wants to be him.

17:14.545 --> 17:17.112
Oh, I must tell you I'm
obsessed with this character.

17:17.114 --> 17:19.415
Oh, well, get in line!
So am I.

17:19.415 --> 17:22.451
Yeah, I mean, the...
the problem is that,

17:22.452 --> 17:25.087
you know, with this
time travel element,

17:25.088 --> 17:29.692
she leaves and-and he gets
left behind really early on.

17:29.693 --> 17:32.093
And... well, I'm just

17:32.095 --> 17:34.629
too stupid to figure out
a way to fix it, so...

17:36.332 --> 17:38.600
(quietly): I'm sorry.

17:46.042 --> 17:47.610
I'm going to pitch
something crazy.

17:47.611 --> 17:48.744
Oh.

17:48.745 --> 17:52.348
How about we beef up this
well-endowed gentleman

17:52.349 --> 17:56.851
and, uh, just pull back on the
whole time travel element?

17:57.686 --> 17:59.088
Ooh, aah!
(imitates explosion)

17:59.089 --> 18:00.322
Right?
Wow!

18:00.323 --> 18:01.690
Uh...

18:01.691 --> 18:03.859
tha-that's brilliant!

18:03.860 --> 18:05.361
Oh, my... I mean, I...

18:05.362 --> 18:06.829
Just going off of what you said,

18:06.830 --> 18:09.865
now I'm thinking... can we
just take that whole time...

18:09.866 --> 18:12.701
thing and just get rid of it
and lift the whole thing?

18:12.702 --> 18:15.170
Oh, my God!
Why didn't I think of this?

18:15.171 --> 18:16.471
(sighs)

18:16.473 --> 18:18.906
Because I'm ten
steps ahead of you.

18:18.908 --> 18:20.342
Oh, that's another
character trait

18:20.343 --> 18:21.509
that you might want to add.

18:21.511 --> 18:22.745
Oh, you know what?
Mm-hmm.

18:22.746 --> 18:24.880
Hey, hey! Has anybody seen
an incredibly tall,

18:24.881 --> 18:26.949
dark, handsome man
ten steps ahead of me?

18:26.950 --> 18:29.217
'Cause I have!
(laughs)

18:30.719 --> 18:33.755
Of course, you know, it's
a big change in direction.

18:33.756 --> 18:35.224
I'd have to read some pages

18:35.225 --> 18:36.858
before I could
make the decision.

18:36.859 --> 18:38.894
Yeah, well, you could
read some pages

18:38.895 --> 18:41.161
or you could just read the book.

18:44.617 --> 18:46.228
You played me.

18:46.229 --> 18:48.209
Like a big, British fiddle.

18:51.981 --> 18:54.507
I both love you
and hate you right now.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.860
Oh, the feeling is very mutual.

18:58.140 --> 19:01.318
Now, get me a ball of water
and validate me.
