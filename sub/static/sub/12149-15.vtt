00:13.929 --> 00:14.630
Anna.

00:16.929 --> 00:17.940
Master Liam?

00:18.730 --> 00:20.940
Anna, come closer.

00:22.929 --> 00:24.329
Master Liam, your father....

00:24.730 --> 00:26.690
He'll be at church repenting his sins.

00:27.730 --> 00:31.059
And he should. Closer, Anna.

00:32.530 --> 00:34.990
Why are you in the shadows?
Are you sick?

00:35.530 --> 00:38.270
The light.
It bothers my eyes just now.

00:38.530 --> 00:40.350
And I know the reason why.

00:41.530 --> 00:44.130
Out again all night, is it?
Drinking and whoring!

00:44.530 --> 00:46.000
I smell the stink of it!

00:50.530 --> 00:53.130
- And a good morning to you, Father.
- You're a disgrace.

00:54.130 --> 00:57.039
- If you say so, Father.
- Oh, I do. I do say so.

00:58.329 --> 01:02.189
Have you had enough for one night?
Must you corrupt the servants too?

01:03.130 --> 01:05.829
Servant, Father.
We have one servant.

01:06.129 --> 01:08.019
Anyway, everyone gets corrupted.

01:09.129 --> 01:12.109
But I find some forms
of corruption more pleasant--

01:13.930 --> 01:15.790
I'm ashamed to call you my son.

01:16.329 --> 01:18.049
A layabout and a scoundrel.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.760
You'll never
amount to anything more.

01:39.129 --> 01:41.200
Crazy homeless guy got
out the subway.

01:41.530 --> 01:43.950
Tore up the car,
threatened some passengers.

01:44.530 --> 01:47.340
They pulled the emergency brake.
They're all shaken up.

01:48.129 --> 01:49.319
- What about the suspect?
- Gone.

01:51.129 --> 01:53.590
- The call said a hostage situation.
- It was.

01:54.129 --> 01:55.000
The suspect escaped?

01:55.329 --> 01:57.579
We're still getting
the story, it's unclear.

01:58.329 --> 01:59.590
You have 24 witnesses.

02:00.129 --> 02:02.299
- They all have the same story.
- Which is?

02:03.129 --> 02:06.390
Suspect went out the top vent
while the train was moving.

02:07.329 --> 02:10.000
- He climbed out of a train?
- He was pulled out.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.520
Pulled out by what?

02:16.330 --> 02:17.490
Get statements.

02:46.330 --> 02:49.310
Guess I can forget
about reading him his rights.

03:42.009 --> 03:43.449
It's...

03:45.009 --> 03:46.169
...not a person, is it?

03:47.409 --> 03:48.919
No. Demon.

03:51.610 --> 03:54.419
- And is it--?
- Dead? Yeah, it's dead.

03:55.810 --> 03:57.319
So they die, then.

03:58.810 --> 03:59.969
Yeah.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.509
I'm still having trouble with...

04:06.009 --> 04:08.960
- ...this otherworldly stuff.
- Right.

04:12.610 --> 04:15.800
Demons aren't otherworldly.
In fact, they were here...

04:18.610 --> 04:19.769
...first.

04:22.810 --> 04:24.279
Who should I call?

04:25.209 --> 04:28.649
- Don't call anyone. I'll handle it.
- What do I put in my report?

04:29.410 --> 04:32.250
- Do what you always do.
- This isn't a normal case.

04:33.009 --> 04:36.029
It's L.A., you've seen this a lot.
You didn't have a name for it.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.360
No. I think I'd remember.

04:39.009 --> 04:41.220
People can see what they need to.

04:42.610 --> 04:44.050
Nothing about him stood out.

04:45.009 --> 04:48.029
Except maybe the smell.
Just an average homeless guy.

04:49.209 --> 04:50.399
This is what we got.

04:52.810 --> 04:55.550
Average height, weight and build.
This is your best?

04:57.610 --> 04:58.839
You pulled the emergency brake?

04:59.410 --> 05:00.740
Guy came right at me.

05:01.209 --> 05:03.810
- Why?
- He didn't say.

05:04.209 --> 05:05.149
Why did you pull the brake?

05:06.009 --> 05:07.589
It was an emergency.

05:10.209 --> 05:11.610
Let's get this circulated.

05:12.009 --> 05:14.920
- We want this guy, right?
- We'll do our best.

05:16.810 --> 05:18.490
- Can I go?
- Yeah, you can go.

05:22.209 --> 05:23.370
Why's your father here?

05:30.610 --> 05:33.560
- Daddy, why are you here?
- In the neighborhood.

05:35.410 --> 05:38.110
You've been listening
to that police scanner again.

05:39.610 --> 05:41.149
Nothing on cable, anyway.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.500
You had a hostage situation.
I missed the action.

05:45.610 --> 05:47.779
In 35 years, haven't you seen enough?

05:49.810 --> 05:51.600
Do you know I'm lead officer on scene?

05:54.009 --> 05:56.819
You're doing okay, get back to it.

06:01.209 --> 06:03.699
- What's he up to?
- He's checking up on me.

06:05.410 --> 06:06.319
You sound surprised.

06:09.610 --> 06:11.290
No, you don't get to do that.

06:13.209 --> 06:14.470
- What?
- Kill a demon in front of me...

06:15.009 --> 06:18.199
...then act like we'll have coffee
together. That doesn't work.

06:19.209 --> 06:21.980
- How does it work?
- I'm not sure it does.

06:24.610 --> 06:28.819
No offense. I think you're probably
a pretty decent guy for what you are.

06:30.009 --> 06:33.339
This is business, not personal.
I'm not your girlfriend.

06:35.810 --> 06:37.139
Who is he?

06:38.810 --> 06:40.319
Who, that one?

06:42.410 --> 06:43.279
Yes.

06:47.209 --> 06:48.649
He's magnificent.

06:50.810 --> 06:52.350
Oh, yeah. God's gift, all right.

06:53.209 --> 06:56.120
Really? I've never
known God to be so generous.

06:56.810 --> 06:59.019
His lies sound pretty
when stars are out.

07:01.610 --> 07:04.029
He forgets his promises at sunrise.

07:07.610 --> 07:10.029
That's not a problem for me, actually.

07:13.610 --> 07:14.980
Pay attention!

07:15.410 --> 07:17.689
We just have to decide
what the code will be.

07:20.209 --> 07:22.980
- Code?
- For the security system we got.

07:23.810 --> 07:26.829
- What have we been talking about?
- I don't....

07:27.410 --> 07:29.550
It should be something
easy to remember.

07:30.410 --> 07:31.670
Like my birthday.

07:32.209 --> 07:34.740
- I don't know your birthday.
- I'm aware of that.

07:35.209 --> 07:38.300
After 11 months of punching it in,
you won't have any excuses.

07:40.610 --> 07:42.610
- Did you identify it?
- I believe so.

07:44.810 --> 07:46.529
Would that be the demon you
encountered this morning?

07:47.209 --> 07:48.290
Yeah, that's him.

07:48.410 --> 07:50.509
Her. It's a Kwaini.
They're all female.

07:51.410 --> 07:52.569
How do we dispose of them?

07:53.209 --> 07:56.860
Should be standard. Burial in virgin
soil, simple Latinate incantation.

07:57.410 --> 07:58.810
- However....
- What?

07:59.810 --> 08:02.089
Well, it's curious.
According to the books...

08:02.810 --> 08:05.339
...a Kwaini is a peaceful demon.

08:05.810 --> 08:06.970
- Nonviolent.
- Nonviolent?

08:07.610 --> 08:09.750
No. This thing was a fighter.

08:10.009 --> 08:12.959
Not if it's a Kwaini.
Not a fighter by nature.

08:13.610 --> 08:16.100
They're articulate, gentle creatures.

08:16.610 --> 08:18.889
Not capable of
the strength you described.

08:19.610 --> 08:21.639
Maybe it was just having a bad day.

08:24.410 --> 08:27.110
- Something set it off.
- Clearly.

08:27.410 --> 08:30.110
Forget whether it should've
fought well as it did.

08:31.009 --> 08:34.590
What would make a peaceful demon
attack a train full of commuters?

08:35.210 --> 08:36.750
Something on the train?

08:38.808 --> 08:39.970
Or someone.

08:47.210 --> 08:50.120
- Angel.
- Hi. Can we talk?

08:50.809 --> 08:52.809
- What's up?
- It's about that demon.

08:53.809 --> 08:57.039
If you must discuss this, could
you please not use that word?

08:58.009 --> 09:01.419
It makes me, I don't
know, just uncomfortable.

09:02.210 --> 09:03.960
Just say "evil thing," okay?

09:04.610 --> 09:05.909
- Sure.
- Thanks.

09:07.009 --> 09:08.549
I thought you'd handle it.

09:08.809 --> 09:12.529
I am. It's just that the
evil thing wasn't evil.

09:14.210 --> 09:15.539
The evil thing wasn't evil?

09:16.009 --> 09:17.659
Well, it was an evil thing.

09:18.409 --> 09:20.480
It wasn't an evil-evil thing.

09:21.409 --> 09:22.919
There are not evil-evil things?

09:23.809 --> 09:25.980
Well, yeah.

09:28.009 --> 09:29.059
All right. Sorry.

09:29.809 --> 09:31.529
How did you get in here?
It's daylight.

09:32.210 --> 09:35.470
- Sewer system.
- Right. I remember.

09:35.809 --> 09:38.899
- I need the names of the passengers.
- Why?

09:40.009 --> 09:41.409
I think the demon--

09:41.809 --> 09:45.360
- The train was targeted for a reason.
- The "evil thing" needs a reason?

09:46.009 --> 09:48.500
- It was after something, someone.
- Nothing was there.

09:49.009 --> 09:50.169
- Passengers.
- Checked out.

09:50.809 --> 09:54.320
Look into them. We'll start with
the guy who pulled the brake.

09:55.009 --> 09:56.870
- He said--
- It's still dead, right?

09:58.009 --> 10:00.639
- Yeah.
- Good. I'd like to forget about it.

10:01.610 --> 10:02.809
- I think--
- There's nothing here.

10:02.809 --> 10:04.980
Your not evil "evil thing" was just evil.

10:05.809 --> 10:06.970
Can't we leave it at that?

10:08.009 --> 10:10.639
I guess you can't blame
her for being skittish,

10:11.610 --> 10:15.299
I don't know. Since she tried
to kill me, it's been different.

10:16.409 --> 10:17.490
She'll come round.

10:17.610 --> 10:20.070
Most people require time to adjust...

10:20.610 --> 10:23.100
...after seeing the dark
forces around us,

10:24.210 --> 10:26.279
- Women, in particular...
- Found it!

10:27.210 --> 10:28.539
...struggle with it.

10:29.610 --> 10:30.769
If she struggles with...

10:31.409 --> 10:34.289
...the bigger picture,
she'll miss the details.

10:36.210 --> 10:38.100
- Details?
- Yeah.

10:38.610 --> 10:41.940
Like why a guy who drives a van
would be on a train during work.

10:42.809 --> 10:43.409
Good question,

10:43.409 --> 10:45.730
Anyway, we've located
the Kwaini's body.

10:47.009 --> 10:48.799
- Okay, you'll run the tests?
- Yes,

10:49.409 --> 10:50.639
See you at the office.

12:23.889 --> 12:25.120
- Mr. Lockley?
- Yeah.

12:25.690 --> 12:28.460
I'm Angel. We met at your party.

12:29.289 --> 12:31.429
- I'm Katie's friend.
- Did something--?

12:32.889 --> 12:33.970
She's fine.

12:34.690 --> 12:36.970
- She with you?
- No. She doesn't know I'm here.

12:38.289 --> 12:41.029
I bet she'd like to know
who else was visiting you.

12:41.889 --> 12:45.120
She thought you were there
because you were worried?

12:46.090 --> 12:48.620
- What do you want?
- What was in that package?

12:49.090 --> 12:50.279
What do you mean?

12:50.889 --> 12:53.980
You took something from the crime
scene that the police didn't find.

12:56.289 --> 12:57.659
Who do you work for?

12:58.090 --> 13:00.340
I don't work for anyone.
I'm retired.

13:01.090 --> 13:04.389
I'll find out. I'm telling you
out of respect for Kate.

13:04.690 --> 13:05.740
Are you threatening me?

13:07.690 --> 13:09.720
No. I want to protect your daughter.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.700
Protect my daughter?
From what?

13:12.490 --> 13:15.470
Finding out you weren't there
today because you care.

13:17.289 --> 13:19.990
- You got any kids, Angel?
- No.

13:20.889 --> 13:23.590
Don't think you
know how a father feels...

13:24.490 --> 13:26.279
...or why he does what he does.

13:29.289 --> 13:31.500
Liam! You'll do as I say!

13:31.690 --> 13:34.320
Sweet Kathy. No tears.

13:36.490 --> 13:38.240
- We'll meet again.
- Not if you defy me.

13:38.889 --> 13:40.289
Not as long as I live.

13:46.090 --> 13:47.559
Move away from the door.

13:47.889 --> 13:49.710
Go, but don't expect to come back.

13:50.289 --> 13:52.850
As you wish.
Always just as you wish.

13:53.889 --> 13:56.980
It was a son I wished for! A man!

13:57.490 --> 14:00.049
Instead, God gave me you.
A disappointment!

14:01.090 --> 14:03.049
You couldn't have asked for better.

14:03.490 --> 14:07.210
You told me in word, in glance,
what it is you've required of me.

14:07.690 --> 14:09.580
And I've met your goals, haven't I?

14:10.090 --> 14:11.559
That's madness!

14:12.490 --> 14:14.980
The madness is, I couldn't fail enough.

14:15.490 --> 14:16.610
We'll fix that now.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.159
I fear for you, lad.

14:19.690 --> 14:23.590
And is that all you can find
in your heart for me now, Father?

14:25.090 --> 14:26.700
Who'll take you in? No one!

14:27.490 --> 14:30.679
I'll find a place to sleep,
I tell you that. Out of my way.

14:35.889 --> 14:37.919
I was never in your way, boy.

14:42.490 --> 14:46.559
If you go courting trouble,
you're sure to find it!

15:01.690 --> 15:03.019
You know what to do...

15:06.490 --> 15:07.500
...darling boy,

15:10.690 --> 15:13.919
I could show you
things you've never seen,

15:28.690 --> 15:29.850
Why the urge for lunch?

15:30.289 --> 15:31.549
Lunch time, ain't it?

15:32.690 --> 15:34.299
So you drive here for a hot dog?

15:35.090 --> 15:37.409
One of Manny's. Best there is.

15:38.090 --> 15:39.490
I'll let you and Manny speak.

15:40.490 --> 15:42.909
I thought I'd spend time with
my daughter.

15:47.090 --> 15:47.929
So....

15:48.289 --> 15:51.799
- You been good?
- Yeah. Yeah, good.

15:53.690 --> 15:55.759
And how's Angel?

15:57.889 --> 15:59.049
Pardon me?

16:00.289 --> 16:02.320
Tall guy you brought
to my retirement party.

16:02.690 --> 16:04.129
Yeah, I know who you mean.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.230
That ain't a Mexican name,
is it? Angel?

16:08.090 --> 16:09.600
I don't think so.

16:10.490 --> 16:12.240
You two seeing each other?

16:13.490 --> 16:16.159
We were never
seeing each other, Daddy.

16:17.090 --> 16:18.700
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

16:19.490 --> 16:21.029
Must be something. He married?

16:21.289 --> 16:24.100
- No.
- West Hollywood?

16:24.889 --> 16:25.970
Daddy, no.

16:26.690 --> 16:29.919
Angel's just not my type.
Or I'm not his type.

16:30.889 --> 16:33.379
There's a type and it's the wrong one.

16:34.490 --> 16:35.500
He got a job?

16:36.889 --> 16:38.120
Yeah. He's a P.I.

16:39.289 --> 16:42.659
Private investigator. He any good?

16:45.889 --> 16:48.519
Yeah, he's good. Very good.

16:50.090 --> 16:53.460
- He likes working nights.
- That's good.

16:53.690 --> 16:55.230
That's good he's good.

16:58.490 --> 17:00.289
You came here to talk about...

17:00.289 --> 17:02.080
...a guy you saw me with once?

17:03.289 --> 17:05.680
Well, he made an impression.

17:07.490 --> 17:09.559
- You like him?
- No. Not really.

17:11.089 --> 17:12.809
Then what's this all about?

17:13.490 --> 17:15.700
Nothing. Just....

17:18.890 --> 17:20.750
It's not good to be alone.

17:26.690 --> 17:30.170
Well, vivisection confirms it.
This certainly is a Kwaini.

17:30.890 --> 17:32.500
So they become violent?

17:32.690 --> 17:35.809
No. My tests
detected something else.

17:39.289 --> 17:42.059
- What is it?
- Think of it as the adrenal gland.

17:42.289 --> 17:44.609
- It should be a lot smaller.
- What happened?

17:45.289 --> 17:47.920
The inflammation was
caused by this substance.

17:48.890 --> 17:50.990
I found traces of it in
the Kwaini's system.

17:51.289 --> 17:52.160
Know what it is?

17:52.490 --> 17:54.950
Difficult to say
under these conditions.

17:55.490 --> 17:58.819
But what I can tell you is,
it's synthetic...

17:59.690 --> 18:02.529
...and it seems to contain properties
not unlike PCP.

18:03.289 --> 18:05.460
Though more metaphysical in nature.

18:05.690 --> 18:07.970
I found "eye of newt"
as an ingredient...

18:08.690 --> 18:11.710
...added chiefly for
taste rather than kick.

18:12.289 --> 18:13.759
- It was on drugs.
- Yes.

18:14.690 --> 18:16.650
The delivery guy was carrying.

18:17.089 --> 18:19.440
I think it would be fair
to assume it...

18:20.089 --> 18:21.910
...was jonesing to get well, yes.

18:22.490 --> 18:26.210
Not only did this turn it violent,
it enhanced its strength.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.160
Times 20, I would say.

18:30.289 --> 18:33.099
What would happen if
a battle demon took this?

18:35.690 --> 18:36.880
I shudder to think.

18:37.490 --> 18:38.819
Hey, guys?

18:39.289 --> 18:42.769
Why have a security system
if you never turn it on?

18:43.490 --> 18:45.630
I could have been anyone
or anything.

18:45.890 --> 18:47.890
Move your entrails.

18:48.890 --> 18:49.970
So you're back.

18:50.089 --> 18:54.339
Good, Mr. "I-Can't-Follow-Suspects-
In-Daylight-Because-I'll-Burn."

18:55.490 --> 18:58.509
- What'd you find?
- I hate following detail.

18:59.089 --> 19:00.700
The voyeuristic side is unseemly.

19:01.490 --> 19:04.329
How about traffic?
And parking? Or the lack of it?

19:05.089 --> 19:08.039
- Not like the movies, is it?
- No. Fortunately, I am.

19:10.490 --> 19:13.400
So it turns out he
really is a delivery guy.

19:14.089 --> 19:16.410
It's not the package
he got from Kate's dad.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.579
He had lunch here
and was in there forever.

19:20.089 --> 19:22.930
Don't know what they served,
but he had leftovers.

19:23.690 --> 19:25.900
That's it. That's the source.

19:26.690 --> 19:28.509
That's where it's all coming from.

19:29.089 --> 19:30.289
Guy's name is Angel.

19:30.289 --> 19:32.289
He's an investigator. A good one.

19:33.289 --> 19:35.180
Why is he looking at our operation?

19:35.690 --> 19:37.970
I don't know.
He's got his reasons.

19:39.289 --> 19:41.220
- What was in the package?
- We agreed--

19:41.690 --> 19:43.549
We agreed that I'd use
my connections...

19:44.089 --> 19:46.019
...to help you move illegal parts.

19:46.490 --> 19:48.950
We didn't agree that I'd remove
crime evidence...

19:49.490 --> 19:51.349
...or use my daughter
for information.

19:51.890 --> 19:55.369
We understand what you've done for us.
We're appreciative.

20:06.289 --> 20:07.230
My advice to you:

20:08.089 --> 20:10.119
Whatever you're moving in
your packages...

20:11.690 --> 20:13.339
...dial it down for a while.

20:18.289 --> 20:20.680
Sound advice, Mr. Lockley.
Thank you.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.690
How should we deal with Angel, sir?

20:26.690 --> 20:28.230
- Kill him.
- Is that wise?

20:29.089 --> 20:31.339
Lockley doesn't like
our arrangement.

20:31.490 --> 20:33.630
Angel's death could turn him.

20:34.490 --> 20:35.680
Kill Lockley too.

20:36.289 --> 20:40.190
Must I think of everything?
Someone get me an adrenal gland.

20:50.849 --> 20:52.390
A man of just 26 years.

20:52.650 --> 20:55.109
Liam was loved
by everyone he met....

21:03.450 --> 21:07.240
We pray that you take his
eternal soul into your care.

22:23.849 --> 22:25.359
Welcome to my world.

22:26.250 --> 22:28.500
It hurts, I know. But not for long.

22:29.250 --> 22:31.180
Birth is always painful.

22:34.049 --> 22:36.299
I could feel them above me...

22:37.049 --> 22:38.940
...as I slept in the earth.

22:39.450 --> 22:40.710
Their heartbeats...

22:41.849 --> 22:45.289
- ...blood coursing in their veins.
- Yes.

22:47.250 --> 22:49.990
- Was it a dream?
- A dream for you.

22:50.849 --> 22:53.170
Soon, their nightmare.

22:53.849 --> 22:55.109
You there!

22:58.650 --> 23:00.539
What have you done?

23:02.849 --> 23:04.319
Grave robbers!

23:08.250 --> 23:09.930
You know what to do.

23:16.650 --> 23:18.329
Our Father, who art in heaven...

23:19.049 --> 23:20.099
...hallowed be thy name.

23:20.849 --> 23:24.039
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.
Give us this day--

23:39.450 --> 23:41.130
It all makes sense
now, doesn't it?

23:41.849 --> 23:43.009
Perfect sense.

23:43.650 --> 23:47.019
You can do anything.
Have anyone in the village.

23:48.450 --> 23:49.430
Who will it be?

23:49.650 --> 23:50.589
Anyone?

23:53.250 --> 23:55.039
I thought I'd take the village.

23:59.769 --> 24:02.789
O-5-2-2.

24:03.970 --> 24:04.880
There. See?

24:06.369 --> 24:10.410
Right. Now we're protected by
home and workplace security...

24:11.170 --> 24:14.079
...designed to compliment
any room, home or office.

24:14.769 --> 24:18.069
No minions of hell get in
without us knowing first.

24:18.970 --> 24:21.289
Sun'll be down soon. I'm going out.

24:21.970 --> 24:24.109
- You'll want backup.
- No. Not this time.

24:24.970 --> 24:27.359
I need to know what we're facing.

24:27.970 --> 24:30.740
Right. A cautious approach is best.

24:30.970 --> 24:34.089
- "Fools rush in."
- No, he wants you to stay here.

24:35.769 --> 24:38.369
- Hi.
- Give me that.

24:39.970 --> 24:42.069
- Am I interrupting?
- No, come in.

24:43.569 --> 24:44.410
Here.

24:46.569 --> 24:47.480
What's this?

24:47.769 --> 24:51.670
The list of names you asked for.
Passengers on the train.

24:53.170 --> 24:54.150
Right.

24:57.970 --> 24:58.950
Thank you.

25:01.569 --> 25:03.220
Why'd you change your mind?

25:04.569 --> 25:07.339
- Something my father said.
- Your father?

25:08.170 --> 25:09.710
He asked if you were good.

25:10.569 --> 25:11.440
"Good"?

25:12.369 --> 25:14.650
At what you do. I said you were.

25:16.569 --> 25:17.549
Thanks.

25:18.369 --> 25:22.130
No matter how uncomfortable I am
with certain circumstances...

25:23.769 --> 25:25.309
...I can't ignore your instincts.

25:25.569 --> 25:28.690
If you think there's more
going on, there probably is.

25:29.769 --> 25:32.440
- I appreciate that.
- And I'd like to be involved.

25:33.369 --> 25:34.240
What?

25:34.569 --> 25:37.730
In the case. You find something,
you bring me in, okay?

25:41.170 --> 25:42.539
Are you sure about that?

25:44.170 --> 25:47.500
- Gotta face those demons sometime.
- Right.

25:50.769 --> 25:53.509
Isn't this above and beyond
the call of duty?

25:53.769 --> 25:55.000
Let's try, Wesley.

25:56.170 --> 25:58.380
I understand you
want to protect her...

25:58.569 --> 26:00.849
...from learning about her father.

26:01.569 --> 26:04.130
You've already warned him once,
and that's too much.

26:04.569 --> 26:08.150
I warned him about me, but he
needs to know who he's working for.

26:09.369 --> 26:11.539
- If he doesn't already know.
- He can't.

26:11.769 --> 26:15.420
Perhaps. Still, he must realize
he's in league with someone...

26:16.569 --> 26:18.710
...who, if not criminal,
is unethical.

26:18.970 --> 26:20.579
- It's his choice.
- I understand.

26:21.369 --> 26:25.269
Sometimes the price for a bad choice
isn't equivalent with the offense.

26:26.170 --> 26:28.589
- Go set him straight.
- Thank you.

26:36.369 --> 26:39.319
- Hope he knows what he's doing.
- Have faith, Wesley.

26:40.569 --> 26:42.009
Door is open,

26:42.369 --> 26:43.309
Yeah, thanks.

26:45.970 --> 26:47.720
Bathroom window is ajar,

27:06.369 --> 27:08.049
Bet you'd like some of this?

27:10.569 --> 27:11.480
Hopheads.

27:16.569 --> 27:18.109
Window is open,

27:19.569 --> 27:20.410
I'm unplugging it.

27:21.369 --> 27:23.119
All right. Talk.

27:24.369 --> 27:28.230
Kate, pick up. Get your father
out of his house. He's in danger.

27:31.569 --> 27:34.759
- Mr. Lockley, may we come in?
- What do you want?

27:35.769 --> 27:38.160
Let us inside.
It concerns your daughter.

27:39.970 --> 27:43.480
He doesn't know, he won't understand.
I'm on way there now.

27:51.210 --> 27:53.769
You're like the rest of them, Father.

27:54.809 --> 27:58.000
Cowering in their houses.
Boarding up the windows.

27:59.009 --> 28:01.009
Smearing garlic in their doorways.

28:02.009 --> 28:04.150
You'd think something evil, vile...

28:05.609 --> 28:08.490
...and monstrous was
terrorizing this village...

28:09.809 --> 28:10.970
...and everyone in it.

28:11.009 --> 28:12.970
Be gone, unclean thing.

28:14.009 --> 28:17.630
A demon cannot enter
where he is not welcome.

28:18.210 --> 28:19.369
He must be invited!

28:20.009 --> 28:23.200
That's true. But I was invited.

28:36.809 --> 28:40.779
She thought I'd
returned to her, an angel.

28:43.410 --> 28:44.599
Murderer!

28:47.609 --> 28:48.730
Strange.

28:50.609 --> 28:53.630
Somehow you seemed
taller when I was alive.

28:55.410 --> 28:57.410
Lord, bind this demon now.

28:58.410 --> 29:01.009
To think I ever let
a tiny, trembling thing...

29:01.410 --> 29:03.660
...make me feel like you did.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.690
Deliver me unto
thy protection, Father.

29:06.809 --> 29:07.789
You said I wasn't a man.

29:09.210 --> 29:12.539
You told me I was nothing,
and I believed you.

29:13.410 --> 29:15.660
You said I'd never amount
to anything.

29:19.410 --> 29:20.740
You were wrong.

29:23.009 --> 29:24.380
You see, Father...

29:26.609 --> 29:30.470
...I have made something
of myself, after all.

29:43.410 --> 29:45.579
- You boys like a drink?
- We'll wait.

29:48.210 --> 29:50.490
So you said this was about Katie.

29:51.210 --> 29:52.859
Yes. Just a question.

29:53.009 --> 29:57.079
You haven't mentioned
our association, have you?

29:59.009 --> 30:01.750
She doesn't know a thing. Why?

30:02.009 --> 30:04.259
We thought that had you
confided in her...

30:05.009 --> 30:07.329
...she might not share
your pragmatism.

30:08.609 --> 30:10.400
Given her position and youth.

30:11.609 --> 30:13.640
You're afraid
she's not crooked like me.

30:14.009 --> 30:16.430
She'll never be, I've seen to it.

30:17.009 --> 30:19.890
Providing for her future.
I'm glad we could help.

30:21.809 --> 30:22.750
Yeah.

30:24.809 --> 30:28.950
I'll thank you when I get my Father
of the Year award. Anything else?

30:30.210 --> 30:31.960
Just one more thing.

30:44.009 --> 30:46.960
- I need you to invite me in.
- What? Get out of here.

30:48.809 --> 30:51.269
- Invite me in. Do it now.
- You need to go.

30:51.809 --> 30:53.490
Invite me in!

30:54.809 --> 30:55.509
Invite me in!

31:00.809 --> 31:02.140
You're not welcome here.

31:02.609 --> 31:05.309
If he dies, I'll come in
and kill you both.

31:34.410 --> 31:36.339
Oh, Daddy! No, Dad!

31:50.650 --> 31:51.519
Kate.

31:53.049 --> 31:54.420
Kate, he invited them in.

31:54.849 --> 31:58.470
- But you knew.
- I wanted to save him...

32:00.250 --> 32:01.329
...he wouldn't let me.

32:03.849 --> 32:06.269
He didn't understand what
he was involved in.

32:06.849 --> 32:10.150
Get out! Get out!
Get out!

32:11.049 --> 32:12.700
Get out. Please get out.

32:15.849 --> 32:17.220
Please get out.

32:44.650 --> 32:47.670
What happened to
"investigating before rushing in"?

32:48.250 --> 32:50.990
- That was plan A. We're on B.
- Plan B is?

32:51.849 --> 32:53.740
Do I have to explain it to you?

32:55.450 --> 32:56.319
No.

33:55.009 --> 33:57.150
Unlike my father,
I know what you are.

33:58.009 --> 33:59.480
- Do you?
- Oh, yeah.

33:59.809 --> 34:00.750
I see.

34:04.009 --> 34:06.289
I know it won't kill you,
but this will.

34:11.809 --> 34:12.789
Told you I knew.

34:13.010 --> 34:16.559
What do you know?
Do you know what walks this city?

34:22.010 --> 34:25.518
You have no comprehension
of what stands before you!

34:26.809 --> 34:29.550
A demon who thinks
he's scarier than he is?

34:31.610 --> 34:33.119
Yeah, she knows.

34:53.210 --> 34:55.030
We go, you won't lose your head.

34:58.610 --> 34:59.659
Let's go.

35:09.409 --> 35:10.989
- You're dead.
- I'm already dead.

35:14.210 --> 35:15.719
Welcome to the club.

35:25.010 --> 35:26.019
You okay?

35:30.409 --> 35:33.219
Never trust an evil-evil thing.

35:37.010 --> 35:40.269
Kate, I know that
what happened with your father....

35:42.409 --> 35:43.809
My father was human.

35:48.409 --> 35:50.409
You don't know anything about that.

36:01.610 --> 36:03.429
This contest is ended, is it?

36:09.210 --> 36:12.329
- Now I've won.
- Are you sure?

36:13.409 --> 36:14.639
Of course.

36:15.809 --> 36:18.619
- I proved who had the power here.
- You think?

36:20.010 --> 36:21.170
What?

36:21.809 --> 36:24.409
Your victory over
him took but moments.

36:28.409 --> 36:29.250
Yes.

36:29.610 --> 36:31.639
His defeat
of you will last lifetimes.

36:32.610 --> 36:35.980
What are you talking about?
He can't defeat me now.

36:37.409 --> 36:38.739
Nor can he approve of you...

36:39.809 --> 36:42.550
...in this world or any other.

36:45.210 --> 36:47.840
What we once were informs
all that we become.

36:50.610 --> 36:52.429
The same love infects our hearts...

36:53.010 --> 36:57.050
...even if they no longer beat.
Simple death won't change that.

37:00.809 --> 37:02.139
Love?

37:05.010 --> 37:06.730
Is this the work of love?

37:08.610 --> 37:11.380
Darling boy. So young.

37:12.809 --> 37:14.840
Still so very young.

37:15.305 --> 37:21.614
