WEBVTT

00:14.473 --> 00:15.474
Yeah.

00:16.892 --> 00:18.060
Oh, yeah.

00:22.606 --> 00:23.607
You're up.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.526
Where am I?

00:25.609 --> 00:26.985
Drink your pink.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.200
That's Tyler. He's almost done.

00:33.283 --> 00:37.079
He makes these movies
about surfing sometimes.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.830
Just drink, don't think.
Where are you from?

00:44.169 --> 00:46.004
How did you get me in here? What--

00:46.088 --> 00:47.840
-What time is it?
-I'm asking the questions. Who is it?

00:48.882 --> 00:50.259
Studio Cindy? Body-by-the-Bay?

00:50.342 --> 00:52.928
Who the fuck sent you
to spy on my class and steal my moves?

00:53.929 --> 00:54.930
Nobody.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.683
I see you following me in my car.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.978
Was it Breem?

01:02.855 --> 01:04.857
Are you one of his Mormon morality spies?

01:08.110 --> 01:10.320
I said drink the pink. Finish it.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.533
What's in this?

01:14.616 --> 01:16.368
Sugar-free pink lemonade...

01:16.869 --> 01:17.828
and speed.

01:18.954 --> 01:21.081
Where the hell is my one-hitter?

01:21.164 --> 01:23.792
You have to put it
in the same place every time.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.587
Don't start with me.
I've been up all night.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.007
You guys live here in the mall?

01:31.133 --> 01:34.094
-She kinda sounds like a spy.
-I told you she might be a spy.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.765
This is my studio.

01:39.474 --> 01:42.144
I make movies about surfing sometimes.

01:42.227 --> 01:45.689
And sometimes we work late and crash.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.817
But we don't live here
'cause it's against the rules.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.030
Your one-hitter's above your head.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.787
At least somebody gets it.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.040
Now, if you ladies don't mind,

02:03.123 --> 02:04.875
I'm gonna get back to my work.

02:05.501 --> 02:07.252
Your work?

02:08.836 --> 02:10.255
What the fuck's that supposed to mean?

02:10.339 --> 02:13.467
Just because you bought a fucking
video camera with my fucking credit card

02:13.550 --> 02:15.844
doesn't make you a fucking movie director.

02:15.928 --> 02:19.348
You know what? I don't need this shit.
I don't need you not believing in me.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.352
We're gonna need money.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.523
Paid for the fucking video camera
with my fucking--

02:27.606 --> 02:29.316
Video World!

02:32.319 --> 02:33.320
Money.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.873
Give me a goddamn grand
or I tell my good friend John Breem

02:44.957 --> 02:47.459
there's two squatters
making porno in his mall

02:47.543 --> 02:49.253
and you're both kicked out on your asses.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.220
Get the coffee can.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.013
Seriously?

03:00.889 --> 03:02.057
Get the coffee can.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.571
Well, that was one of your weirder dreams.

03:16.488 --> 03:19.491
Although, hang on a second. Why am I so...

03:29.877 --> 03:33.213
Oh, my God. You did it. You crazy--

03:34.006 --> 03:37.176
"We have flown the air like birds

03:37.259 --> 03:40.304
and swum the sea like fishes,

03:40.387 --> 03:43.182
but we have yet to learn the simple act

03:43.265 --> 03:46.351
of walking the earth like brothers."

03:47.352 --> 03:49.479
Who said that, huh? Who do you think?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.065
I don't know.

03:52.149 --> 03:56.361
Martin Luther Goddamn King Jr.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.030
Yeah.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.991
He's linking civil rights
with environmental rights.

04:01.074 --> 04:05.204
Challenging the agents of scientific
advance and economic development

04:05.287 --> 04:09.374
not to leave behind the needs
of a vulnerable planet in the process.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.168
Damn! I found it.

04:11.251 --> 04:15.047
The critical plank in my platform.
It's brilliant, right?

04:15.714 --> 04:16.714
Yeah.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.594
You don't look like it's brilliant.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.222
What? What do I look like?

04:23.305 --> 04:26.099
Well, like you think I'm a phony,
but you don't wanna hurt my feelings.

04:26.183 --> 04:30.812
Honey, come on.
I'm just waking up. I'm sorry.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.481
You know, I'm trying to try things

04:32.564 --> 04:34.608
that might get me
this goddamn endorsement.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.735
Tell me again. Tell me again.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.695
Because you weren't listening?
That's great.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.155
I can't even get your attention.

04:40.239 --> 04:43.242
Why would I expect anyone of significance
to listen to me, huh?

04:43.325 --> 04:44.618
Why? All right.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.662
I didn't mean that--

04:46.745 --> 04:48.622
You know what the hell I meant, okay?

04:48.705 --> 04:50.874
Yeah, that's asshole for "I need help."

04:50.958 --> 04:53.710
I don't know,
I just think you need to simplify it.

04:54.253 --> 04:55.337
Come up with something...

04:55.420 --> 04:56.839
Dumb and catchy.

04:56.922 --> 04:59.758
Do some sloganeering, huh? "I like Ike."

04:59.842 --> 05:01.510
"Danny has a nice fanny."

05:02.636 --> 05:03.846
I don't know, maybe you're right.

05:05.055 --> 05:09.351
You know, it has been seven years
since I've woken up on a Monday morning

05:09.434 --> 05:12.980
without a class to teach
or even prep for and...

05:13.897 --> 05:18.110
I gotta tell you, the freedom, it is...

05:19.361 --> 05:22.030
It's freeing... I guess.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.492
What about you? What is your day like?

05:25.576 --> 05:28.287
You know, drop off and then--
then what happens after that?

05:28.370 --> 05:30.706
God forbid
you have anything valuable to do.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.249
'Cause I was thinking maybe--

05:32.916 --> 05:34.251
Maybe I'd tag along with you.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.212
We could do some more talking
and maybe we can do some brainstorming.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.674
Maya! Breakfast!

05:40.757 --> 05:41.758
You know, the two of us.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.260
You better come up with something.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.970
You can't have him on your ass all day.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.054
Babe.

05:47.222 --> 05:49.183
I think you--
you'd probably be really bored.

05:49.266 --> 05:50.934
I'm just doing housewife stuff.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.144
What? No, nonsense.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.771
I'm interested in what you get up to
when I'm at work, you know.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.608
You got a hot plumber
who comes by and services you.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.195
Go ahead.
Tell him you're fucking a plumber.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.780
It's better than what you really do.
Less disgusting.

06:04.323 --> 06:07.492
Today I am coming with, okay?

06:08.952 --> 06:10.871
I'm gonna be the peanut butter
on your sandwich.

06:14.917 --> 06:15.918
Cool.

07:07.636 --> 07:10.055
Why don't you wait here? I won't be long.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.683
Yeah. All right.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.185
995, 1,000.

07:15.269 --> 07:18.480
Okay. I'll just have to have my supervisor
come over and register these.

07:19.690 --> 07:20.691
Sorry?

07:21.191 --> 07:24.486
Any cash deposit over a thousand
needs to be documented.

07:24.570 --> 07:25.654
It's just a formality.

07:25.737 --> 07:26.905
This bitch is on to you.

07:26.989 --> 07:30.033
We've got our signature fresh-baked
oatmeal cookies ready while you wait.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.286
Fatten you up before the slaughter.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.705
I might act--

07:34.788 --> 07:36.415
You know, I forgot
I have a doctor's appointment,

07:36.498 --> 07:38.750
so I'm going to-- I'm gonna come back.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.134
Thank you.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.552
You know, I don't know if you know this,

07:48.635 --> 07:51.138
but burrito actually means
"little donkey."

07:51.221 --> 07:54.975
Yeah, probably 'cause like a donkey,
it could carry a lot of nourishment.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.227
And that was helpful
for our brother day laborers.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.021
You know,
they could go hours without any kind of--

07:59.104 --> 08:01.148
-Hey.
-Beat it, sluts.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.609
You ready to go, sweetie?

08:03.692 --> 08:04.943
Okay. Take care, girls.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.069
Whatever.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.946
You're driving? Okay. Yeah.

08:10.616 --> 08:14.912
So where to
on this adventurous day of yours?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.622
I have to go to ballet class.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.248
You have to?

08:18.332 --> 08:19.625
If I want to get rid of you.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.668
I want to. It's how I keep my figure.

08:21.752 --> 08:22.961
I'll drop you home first.

08:28.258 --> 08:31.178
This is your chance to get what you need.
Don't fuck it up.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.261
Hey.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.222
Sup.

08:34.306 --> 08:35.349
Sup?

08:36.475 --> 08:37.518
She's cool.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.561
-Sup?
-She's cool.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.398
They think you're cool,
so just play it cool.

08:43.482 --> 08:46.485
Don't show your cards, you dumbass.
You need this guy.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.278
Good waves out there today?

08:50.197 --> 08:52.991
Why don't you tell me
what you're fucking here for?

08:53.575 --> 08:54.993
Swing and a miss, fatty.

08:55.077 --> 08:56.870
-I--
-You know we work really hard.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.331
I mean,
right now I'm not 'cause I'm surfing,

08:59.414 --> 09:03.043
but, like, when I'm not surfing,
I'm, like, working my ass off.

09:04.044 --> 09:08.507
So if you're just gonna, like,
keep taking things from us...

09:11.134 --> 09:13.262
I would like to come back
to Bunny's class.

09:13.846 --> 09:15.639
There's nothing else out there
quite like it.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.433
And what she does, it's special

09:19.393 --> 09:20.394
and made me feel...

09:21.812 --> 09:23.146
powerful.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.690
And I would like to continue to feel...

09:25.399 --> 09:26.525
that.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.362
Dude, seriously?

09:30.445 --> 09:31.613
While we still can.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.200
What does he mean while you still can?

09:35.284 --> 09:36.827
Like you don't know.

09:37.619 --> 09:39.621
Your friend Breem's
gonna dig up the river mouth,

09:39.705 --> 09:41.290
change the shape of the whole point,

09:41.373 --> 09:45.085
destroy our whole reason for living,
aka this wave.

09:45.794 --> 09:49.214
People think killer waves are some
God-given accident or some shit.

09:49.298 --> 09:53.343
Really? They are a fragile set
of geologic and oceanic factors.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.387
You fuck with one of them, it's all over.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.600
Anyway.

10:00.851 --> 10:03.061
As far as you coming back
to Bunny's class...

10:04.438 --> 10:05.939
not really seeing that in the clouds.

10:06.607 --> 10:07.941
You mean in the cards?

10:08.025 --> 10:09.526
I mean what I said.

10:10.736 --> 10:11.737
Later.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.997
Are you sure he said it was casual?

10:22.080 --> 10:23.248
I don't know what he said.

10:23.749 --> 10:24.750
I asked you

10:24.833 --> 10:26.793
and you said he invited you
to a gathering at his house,

10:26.877 --> 10:29.296
-and then when I said, "Is it casual--"
-Who the fuck cares?

10:29.379 --> 10:32.174
I'm sorry. I am very nervous right now.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.425
I really need this endorsement.

10:33.509 --> 10:36.261
Okay, so who cares what you look like?
You look great. Okay?

10:38.972 --> 10:42.601
Holy shit. How big is this house?
It's like a hotel.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.395
-Hey! You made it.
-Hey.

10:45.979 --> 10:46.980
-Hi.
-Yeah.

10:47.064 --> 10:51.026
Welcome to our obnoxiously
un-humble abode.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.153
-Wow. Thank you.
-Unreal. Unreal. Yeah.

10:53.237 --> 10:55.113
Ernie Hauser. Pleasure to meet you.

10:55.197 --> 10:57.491
I'm an elbow tapper. Hygiene freak.

10:57.574 --> 11:00.452
Yeah, sorry. This is my wife, Sheila,
and this is our daughter, Maya.

11:00.536 --> 11:03.372
-Hey, Maya. Hi. Hello.
-Hi.

11:03.956 --> 11:06.291
Allow me to introduce you
to my wife, Greta.

11:06.375 --> 11:07.668
Greta-Gret-Gretty!

11:08.585 --> 11:11.213
We actually know each other
from the kids' preschool.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.381
Yeah, great!

11:12.464 --> 11:15.217
So you're one of Greta's
volunteer army draftees?

11:15.300 --> 11:17.594
No, she usually just
drops her daughter off and leaves.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.180
Okay.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.268
-You like margaritas?
-I do.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.103
My girl makes a great one.
Why don't you come over here?

11:26.186 --> 11:27.271
-Go get a margarita.
-See ya.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.941
-I had no idea--
-How rich we are?

11:31.024 --> 11:33.026
Yeah. It's crazy. I know.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.195
Yeah, and who your husband was.

11:35.988 --> 11:37.281
I told you,

11:37.364 --> 11:39.575
and I told you again 'cause
you weren't listening the first time.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.952
Or the second time either, I guess.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.288
Pinky's hungry. She wanna eat.

11:45.581 --> 11:47.875
Well, I think all the kids
are in the TV room.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.459
You wanna get some food
for Pinky in there?

11:49.543 --> 11:51.378
-Yes.
-Okay. Okay, let's go. Come on.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.005
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

11:53.088 --> 11:58.177
A long time ago in the middle
of the forest lived two children.

11:58.260 --> 11:59.887
The boy was named Hansel.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.013
I'm Hansel.

12:01.096 --> 12:03.098
-And the girl was named Gretel.
-I'm Gretel.

12:03.182 --> 12:05.434
God, this place is enormous.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.895
Who needs a house this big?

12:08.645 --> 12:10.314
Someone with an ass that big.

12:11.315 --> 12:13.525
Oh, no. You're caught.

12:15.736 --> 12:18.780
Now you've got to make nice
with those guzzling gossipy...

12:18.864 --> 12:20.324
That's quite the setup over there.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.702
I've never seen a TV that big.
It's like a drive-in.

12:24.828 --> 12:27.623
That's Ernie. You know, he has to have
the newest model of everything.

12:27.706 --> 12:29.333
If it's the biggest one,
Ernie has to have it.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.920
I'm still trying to get Steven
to let me have a microwave.

12:33.003 --> 12:35.506
He thinks they cause cancer.

12:36.173 --> 12:38.050
Well, we've been using ours for popcorn.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.843
-No oil, no mess.
-Nice.

12:39.927 --> 12:42.888
If I can cook a hot dog in ten seconds,
I'll take a little cancer risk.

12:42.971 --> 12:45.933
Why would they allow it in the home
if it wasn't safe?

12:46.016 --> 12:48.143
Other than corporate greed
and government ineptitude?

12:50.729 --> 12:52.898
This is why you keep your thoughts
to yourself, you freak.

12:52.981 --> 12:55.901
You guys moved here from Berkeley, right?

12:55.984 --> 12:56.985
Yeah.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.112
No oil, no mess.

13:03.242 --> 13:04.368
No oil.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.411
Oh, God. He's bombing worse than you are.

13:06.495 --> 13:07.496
Excuse me.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.794
Nobody said that you weren't good enough.

13:13.877 --> 13:17.214
That was the message, Sheila.
Loud and clear.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.467
"Pack up, you stupid hippie Jew.
Pack up and get out."

13:20.551 --> 13:24.179
And now I have to face those fuckers
at the dean's house tomorrow.

13:24.263 --> 13:25.347
What am I gonna say?

13:25.430 --> 13:27.182
You know, pretty soon
the checks are gonna stop.

13:27.266 --> 13:29.685
And how long can we afford
to live off our savings, huh?

13:29.768 --> 13:30.978
What savings? There's none.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.688
Hello! It's not a rhetorical question.

13:32.771 --> 13:35.899
It's fine. I just have to
check my books and do some math.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.527
No, you don't. There's nothing.
You're a liar. Nothing.

13:38.610 --> 13:41.446
Can you please just tell me
what Ernie said?

13:41.989 --> 13:45.242
Yeah, so I can relive the humiliation?
Great.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.119
No. So I know, and I can help.

13:47.202 --> 13:51.748
Okay, well, he said that he didn't
think that I was candidate material.

13:51.832 --> 13:57.045
In fact, I strike him as more
of a behind-the-scenes or strategy guy.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.425
So, you know what? He just needs
a little convincing. That's all.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.343
Why invite me there
if you're just gonna say no?

14:03.427 --> 14:05.929
Something changed. Something happened.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.639
You happened, you fuckup.

14:07.723 --> 14:09.641
And you know what? We're gonna
make some changes around here.

14:09.725 --> 14:13.520
No more extras, no more ballet
until I figure things out. Okay?

14:14.062 --> 14:15.981
I think we pull Maya
out of that nursery school.

14:16.064 --> 14:17.524
That's expensive, right?

14:17.608 --> 14:19.568
No, it's not, actually. It's a co-op.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.737
Well, it's gotta cost something, Sheila.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.322
We have to do something.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.407
And by we, he means you.

14:26.325 --> 14:27.826
Time to fix this mess.

14:31.538 --> 14:32.956
Good morning, everyone.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.667
Morning. Everything okay with Maya?

14:36.210 --> 14:37.211
Yeah.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.505
I'm here to volunteer.

14:40.589 --> 14:42.382
Welcome. The more the merrier.

14:43.091 --> 14:45.219
Greta coordinates co-op assignments.

14:46.762 --> 14:48.138
Morning.

14:49.223 --> 14:50.641
I just wanted to pitch in.

14:50.724 --> 14:51.892
Yeah. Okay.

14:53.227 --> 14:55.270
We could use some help in the sandbox.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.439
Raking out raccoon turds.

14:58.690 --> 14:59.733
That sounds...

14:59.816 --> 15:01.485
-Punitive. Hostile.
-...good.

15:03.946 --> 15:06.490
Of course, Helen's not here yet,
so I could always put her on turd duty.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.701
-And you could help me in song circle.
-Okay.

15:09.785 --> 15:12.996
And then we could just, like,
go to breakfast after or whatever.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.122
Great.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.333
-Song circle time!
-Okay.

15:17.292 --> 15:19.253
How about the "I love my body" song today?

15:19.336 --> 15:20.629
Great.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.633
-I love my...
-Feet!

15:25.717 --> 15:27.344
Oh, yes, I do

15:28.720 --> 15:32.891
I love the funky cool things
They can do

15:32.975 --> 15:34.935
Is this what they do all day? Good God.

15:35.018 --> 15:38.146
I'm gonna show 'em and grow 'em

15:38.230 --> 15:40.732
And let the whole world know 'em

15:41.316 --> 15:45.028
'Cause they're a part of me and you

15:46.280 --> 15:47.281
I love my...

15:47.364 --> 15:48.574
Bagina.

15:49.324 --> 15:50.659
Oh, yes, I do

15:52.160 --> 15:55.956
I love the funky cool things it can do

15:56.039 --> 15:57.082
That's my son.

15:58.584 --> 16:01.503
I'm gonna show it and grow it

16:01.587 --> 16:03.881
And let the whole world know it

16:03.964 --> 16:06.466
And by the time I meet Ernie,
you know, he's just an engineer.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.927
And everyone would fall asleep
whenever he said whatever he did.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.637
They were like, "Polyurethane compounds?"

16:10.721 --> 16:12.514
It's like, "What's that? Snooze fest."

16:12.598 --> 16:15.851
Anyway, somehow he has the foresight
to, like, patent this technology.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.270
You're not touching that cinnamon bun.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.314
I mean, I honestly
don't even think he had any idea

16:20.397 --> 16:21.690
how many applications it would have.

16:21.773 --> 16:24.318
You know, like aerospace
and, like, skateboard wheels.

16:24.401 --> 16:26.403
Well, now everyone thinks
he's so interesting, right?

16:26.486 --> 16:30.115
Like influential, but it's hilarious.
He's just the same old Ernie to me.

16:30.199 --> 16:33.035
He actually reminds me a lot of Danny.

16:33.702 --> 16:35.495
He's a real innovator too.

16:36.455 --> 16:39.583
First time I met him, he was standing
on a milk crate with a megaphone.

16:39.666 --> 16:40.834
You have to try a bite of this.

16:40.918 --> 16:43.128
That stall is better
than any bakery I've ever been to.

16:43.212 --> 16:45.172
Oh, no. Thank you.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.423
Seriously, this is the best I've ever had.

16:46.507 --> 16:47.799
Don't let her distract you.

16:47.883 --> 16:50.427
I know Danny admires your husband
enormously,

16:51.261 --> 16:54.014
especially with all of his success
not changing his politics.

16:54.097 --> 16:55.098
Just a bite.

16:55.766 --> 16:56.767
You won't regret it.

16:57.434 --> 17:00.145
You already regret it.
But what choice do you have?

17:00.229 --> 17:02.523
She's not gonna let it go
until you eat it.

17:05.651 --> 17:07.361
Fuck! That's good.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.781
Woman knows her buns. I'll give her that.

17:13.450 --> 17:16.578
I just wish I could help you
with Ernie's endorsement,

17:16.662 --> 17:19.080
but he doesn't listen to a word I say.

17:20.249 --> 17:22.125
But we're working on that in therapy.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.753
Anyway. I hope that's not why
you're being nice to me. So...

17:26.839 --> 17:28.590
In for a penny, in for a pound.

17:28.674 --> 17:31.426
Now get your fat ass to class
before you explode.

17:31.510 --> 17:33.220
Grapevine to the right!

17:38.976 --> 17:40.602
And at the knees.

17:45.983 --> 17:47.568
Clap. Clap.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.530
High knees!

17:56.201 --> 17:57.828
And clap.

17:57.911 --> 18:01.039
Higher knees! Let me hear you.

18:11.675 --> 18:12.759
I'm sorry. This class is full.

18:12.843 --> 18:15.846
There seems to be plenty of space
back here.

18:15.929 --> 18:20.100
It's at capacity. And if I exceed capacity
then I get in trouble.

18:20.184 --> 18:22.436
And if I get in trouble
then I get kicked out.

18:22.519 --> 18:24.354
Anyone want me to get kicked out?

18:24.438 --> 18:25.522
No.

18:26.273 --> 18:27.399
Then I'm afraid you need to go.

18:28.775 --> 18:29.985
Sheila.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.069
Sheil.

18:31.904 --> 18:34.615
Sheila. Isn't that right, Sheila?

18:34.698 --> 18:35.991
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.618
-Yeah, she inspired me.
-Yeah.

18:37.701 --> 18:38.785
You know what I mean?

18:38.869 --> 18:40.662
It's time to get out there
in the real world.

18:40.746 --> 18:43.373
Make political history
instead of just teaching it.

18:43.457 --> 18:45.959
Well, I think we had agreed
that would be the next chapter.

18:46.043 --> 18:47.669
I'm happy for you.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.088
You always had the gift of gab.

18:50.172 --> 18:53.425
And this way, you no longer have
the pressure to publish.

18:53.509 --> 18:55.177
How's fundraising going?

18:55.886 --> 18:57.638
I mean, that is the main job.

18:57.721 --> 19:01.016
Yeah, it is, and it's going really well.
It's just getting going, but yeah, great.

19:01.099 --> 19:04.061
-Cheese puff?
-Yes, thank you.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.729
I can't resist these.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.815
Simone,
they have you serving food to the faculty?

19:08.899 --> 19:11.193
Yeah. This is my work-study.

19:11.276 --> 19:14.988
You know, last year
I had lawn maintenance, so...

19:15.739 --> 19:16.740
Cheese puff?

19:17.324 --> 19:18.325
No, thank you.

19:18.408 --> 19:19.785
Well, it's good to see you.

19:19.868 --> 19:22.120
I hope you can get that tray down soon.
Maybe get some reading done.

19:22.788 --> 19:24.790
Thanks, Danny. Yeah.

19:24.873 --> 19:27.417
And you too, Sheila.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.920
You guys look great as per usual.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.089
No, you don't.
You look like a beached mermaid.

19:32.172 --> 19:35.050
What were you thinking?
Sequins in this crowd?

19:35.133 --> 19:36.134
Work-study?

19:37.094 --> 19:42.015
In a department dedicated to studying
class structures and historic injustices,

19:42.099 --> 19:44.434
the poor students are set up to fail

19:44.518 --> 19:47.729
while the privileged kids can just
sleep off their hangovers all afternoon?

19:47.813 --> 19:50.190
-Hire tutors?
-And he's off.

19:50.691 --> 19:52.442
Please excuse me.
I'm just gonna look for the restroom.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.027
Yeah.

19:54.111 --> 19:55.571
That's bullshit, you know that, right?

19:55.654 --> 19:56.864
Excuse me.

19:58.949 --> 20:00.200
Sheila.

20:01.285 --> 20:03.662
Hi, Professor Mendelson.

20:03.745 --> 20:06.164
I'm sorry, I--
I wasn't sure if that was you.

20:06.248 --> 20:09.293
No, it felt like
you were running away from me.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.336
Not that you'd be the first woman
that ever did.

20:13.005 --> 20:14.423
Yep. That's a lesbian joke.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.091
We do make them
contrary to popular belief.

20:19.428 --> 20:22.681
You know, despite Danny's departure,

20:23.390 --> 20:26.018
if you're ever ready to resume
your graduate work,

20:26.101 --> 20:27.186
I think we could figure that out.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.146
That's so kind of you.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.607
The baby still needs
a lot of my attention so...

20:31.690 --> 20:33.066
Which one?

20:35.444 --> 20:37.446
You know, I probably shouldn't say this,

20:37.529 --> 20:40.782
but I've already had
two glasses of wine, so...

20:42.367 --> 20:43.493
Here we go.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.455
It really burns me up

20:46.538 --> 20:48.832
that you would give up
your own academic prospects

20:48.916 --> 20:51.418
for that motormouth potato.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.047
You had so much potential,
so much to offer.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.883
That's so kind of you,
Professor Mendelson--

20:57.966 --> 20:59.218
No, fuck kind.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.595
I mean, nobody around here
gives a damn about women's studies,

21:01.678 --> 21:03.430
and I have to fight
for every nickel and dime.

21:03.514 --> 21:07.267
Meanwhile, poli-sci is beating off
resources with sticks. And I--

21:09.770 --> 21:14.816
These are amazing and ridiculous,
and I can't say no.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.444
Of course she can't.
She can't control herself at all.

21:17.528 --> 21:20.948
She's a lonely old lesbian
without a shred of self-respect left.

21:21.031 --> 21:22.699
I'm just gonna look for the restroom.

21:23.283 --> 21:25.160
Not that you're any better.
The road you're on today.

21:25.244 --> 21:28.121
Pastries with icing? Give up.
You might as well just give up.

21:28.205 --> 21:29.540
-Cheese puff?
-No!

21:32.668 --> 21:35.671
You used to be someone of consequence.
Someone who mattered.

21:35.754 --> 21:38.048
Now you're just an overdressed,
over-the-hill,

21:38.131 --> 21:41.426
saggy-ass sad sack
married to yesterday's news.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.152
Jackpot.

22:40.694 --> 22:41.820
You need to go.

22:42.446 --> 22:44.823
That's it. You're done now.

22:45.490 --> 22:48.952
That's the last time, the very last time.

22:49.036 --> 22:50.746
And now you know what to do.

22:50.829 --> 22:53.123
You know exactly what to do.

22:54.291 --> 22:55.959
Hello? Is somebody in there?

22:56.043 --> 22:57.294
I'll be right out.

22:59.922 --> 23:04.092
You're gonna help him win this thing.
You're gonna save our wave.

23:06.303 --> 23:09.806
"There's only one thing
more powerful than we are.

23:09.890 --> 23:14.686
No, it's not Reagan and his warmongers,
or Breem and his bulldozers.

23:15.312 --> 23:16.438
It's the ocean."

23:17.231 --> 23:21.860
"As powerful as it is, it is also fragile.

23:22.444 --> 23:26.657
It is our duty,
our calling as Californians

23:26.740 --> 23:30.327
who celebrate and enjoy
this beautiful coastline,

23:30.994 --> 23:32.037
to protect it."

23:32.120 --> 23:36.083
My name is Danny Rubin
and I am running for State Assembly.

23:38.377 --> 23:41.380
This is my beautiful wife, Sheila,
and our daughter, Maya.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.757
We'd really love to have your support

23:43.841 --> 23:47.219
because with your help
we can save our wave.

23:47.302 --> 23:50.973
Save our wave! Save our wave!

23:51.056 --> 23:52.933
You wanna say good night to Daddy?

23:53.851 --> 23:56.562
Now, in order to get that into...

23:56.645 --> 23:58.814
Yes. Oh, my gosh.
I love it. It's so beautiful.

23:58.897 --> 24:00.649
That was a battle. That was a battle.

24:00.732 --> 24:02.985
I really--
I really petitioned a lot of students...

24:03.569 --> 24:04.945
I'm tired.

24:05.028 --> 24:06.446
Okay. Okay.

24:06.530 --> 24:08.115
Of course you get kicked in the twat.

24:08.198 --> 24:09.741
Why should today be any different?

24:12.327 --> 24:13.537
So, what did you think?

24:14.371 --> 24:16.331
I mean, I like what he had to say.

24:17.249 --> 24:18.250
But I don't know.

24:18.333 --> 24:21.336
That's what politicians do, right?
Say stuff.

24:22.796 --> 24:24.923
What if I told you
I could get you a gig with him?

24:25.924 --> 24:26.967
A film gig.

24:27.676 --> 24:31.805
Supporting his campaign
instead of doing what you're doing.

24:32.472 --> 24:34.224
What the hell's your deal?

24:34.850 --> 24:36.894
I mean, like,
one minute you're working with Breem,

24:36.977 --> 24:38.604
and then you're, like,
with the opposition.

24:38.687 --> 24:40.355
Like, whose side are you on?

24:40.981 --> 24:42.441
It's fucking confusing.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.151
It's like Vertigo.

24:45.027 --> 24:46.361
The movie.

24:47.946 --> 24:49.114
I'm on my side.

24:49.198 --> 24:50.324
Okay.

24:51.491 --> 24:54.161
So I get a video gig.

24:54.912 --> 24:55.996
What do you get?

24:59.958 --> 25:04.171
Fine, but she stands over there
by the fan.

25:06.089 --> 25:07.090
Sorry.

25:07.758 --> 25:09.927
Okay, bunnies. Let's get going!

25:11.261 --> 25:13.263
And take it to the right!

25:13.347 --> 25:16.350
And one, two, three, four, five, six.

25:50.050 --> 25:52.135
Let's do this thing!
