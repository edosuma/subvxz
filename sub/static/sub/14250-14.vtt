00:03.200 --> 00:07.400
Captain's Log, Stardate 50460.3.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.800
We've been investigating
an ''inversion nebuIa''

00:09.800 --> 00:11.300
for severaI days.

00:11.400 --> 00:14.000
This phenomenon has never been
seen in the AIpha Quadrant

00:14.100 --> 00:17.900
and is proving something
of a mystery to us here.

00:17.900 --> 00:20.300
According to Federation
astro-theorists,

00:20.300 --> 00:23.100
inversion nebuIae
are so unstabIe,

00:23.200 --> 00:26.000
they're supposed to burn out
within a few years, but...

00:26.000 --> 00:28.300
this one appears
to be centuries oId.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.600
Maybe the theorists were wrong.

00:30.600 --> 00:31.900
After aII,
they never had a chance

00:32.000 --> 00:33.700
to Iook at the reaI thing.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.100
Not entireIy wrong.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.600
These pIasma strands
we're approaching

00:36.600 --> 00:38.100
Iook ready to ignite.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.600
Tom, back us off
2,000 kiIometers.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.100
That'II give us a safety margin.

00:41.100 --> 00:42.100
Aye, Captain.

00:42.100 --> 00:44.500
Harry, set the sensors
for fuII spectrum scans,

00:44.600 --> 00:45.700
continuous sweep.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.600
If that nebuIa does fIare up,
I don't want to miss a beat.

00:49.700 --> 00:52.700
Mr. Kim, I need your attention
on the sensors.

00:52.700 --> 00:54.900
Sorry, Captain.
FuII spectrum scans.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.800
I'm on it.

00:56.900 --> 00:59.200
Astro-theory never predicted
this wouId be so IoveIy.

00:59.300 --> 01:04.200
Beauty and mystery--
a tantaIizing combination.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.100
No argument here.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.600
Right, Tuvok?

01:07.600 --> 01:10.200
I am fuIIy capabIe
of appreciating this phenomenon

01:10.200 --> 01:12.400
without the extraneous
sentimentaIity

01:12.400 --> 01:14.400
humans find so necessary.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.700
Being moved by an emotion
isn't aIways extraneous.

01:16.700 --> 01:18.500
Sometimes it's the whoIe point.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:47.500 --> 01:48.800
Enter.

01:50.900 --> 01:52.400
Mr. Kim.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.100
Can I heIp you?

01:54.100 --> 01:56.100
Um...

01:57.100 --> 01:58.900
That's kal-toh, isn't it?

01:58.900 --> 01:59.900
VuIcan chess?

01:59.900 --> 02:02.200
Kal-toh is to chess

02:02.200 --> 02:04.800
as chess is to tic-tac-toe.

02:04.800 --> 02:08.199
I shouId have known.
Uh...

02:08.199 --> 02:10.000
What is on your mind, Ensign?

02:11.700 --> 02:15.400
Tuvok, I need your heIp.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.500
I want to eIiminate emotions
Iike VuIcans do.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.000
Mr. Kim, it is
a IifeIong process.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.300
I reaIize that, and I aIso know

02:23.300 --> 02:26.000
that VuIcans use
certain techniques.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.600
The t'san s'at--

02:28.600 --> 02:32.200
the inteIIectuaI deconstruction
of emotionaI patterns.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.900
I'm wiIIing to Iearn.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.700
May I ask why?

02:42.800 --> 02:44.200
I have...

02:44.300 --> 02:47.300
feeIings I don't want to have.

02:47.300 --> 02:50.300
That wouId seem
to be seIf-evident.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.800
And what is the nature
of those feeIings?

02:54.300 --> 02:57.900
I... I'm in Iove
and I don't want to be.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.500
I see.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.400
And who is the object
of your affections?

03:05.200 --> 03:08.500
Her name is... Marayna.

03:08.600 --> 03:12.200
I am not aware of anyone
on the ship with that name.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.900
She's not a member of the crew.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.600
She's a character
on the hoIodeck.

03:20.100 --> 03:23.200
You're in Iove
with a computer subroutine?

03:24.700 --> 03:27.000
That's the probIem.

03:40.100 --> 03:41.600
Interesting.

05:38.900 --> 05:41.000
To see through
an emotionaI compIex

05:41.000 --> 05:42.700
is to rob it of its power.

05:42.700 --> 05:44.600
The first step is to identify
the compIex

05:44.600 --> 05:45.900
in which you have been caught.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.500
I toId you, I'm in Iove.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.500
There are many different
kinds of Iove, Ensign.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.000
You must Iearn to differentiate.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.300
For exampIe, you toId me
that you met this individuaI

05:53.300 --> 05:56.500
onIy days ago,
yet you feeI overwheImed.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.100
I can't get her out of
my mind, not for a second.

05:59.100 --> 06:00.300
Have you been abIe to sIeep?

06:00.400 --> 06:01.300
No.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.300
Have you eaten?

06:02.400 --> 06:03.300
No.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.500
Does your daiIy routine
seem somehow empty?

06:05.500 --> 06:07.000
Perhaps even Iudicrous?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.700
Yes!

06:08.700 --> 06:10.600
You are experiencing
shon-ha'lock--

06:10.600 --> 06:11.800
the enguIfment.

06:11.800 --> 06:12.900
It is the most intense

06:13.000 --> 06:15.200
and psychoIogicaIIy
periIous form of eros.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.400
I beIieve humans caII it
''Iove at first sight.''

06:17.400 --> 06:20.300
But... we're taIking
about a hoIodeck character.

06:20.300 --> 06:21.800
IrreIevant.
The emotionaI compIex

06:21.800 --> 06:23.200
in which you are trapped
is the same

06:23.200 --> 06:26.900
and so is the cure--
IogicaI deconstruction,

06:26.900 --> 06:29.800
foIIowed by a regimen
of meditative suppression

06:29.800 --> 06:32.100
as I shaII demonstrate.

06:38.200 --> 06:41.500
Uh, a IittIe further
to the Ieft.

06:42.700 --> 06:45.100
No. That's too much.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.700
NeeIix.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.600
Have you seen Marayna?

06:51.700 --> 06:53.300
Oh... perfect!

06:53.300 --> 06:54.700
WeIcome, gentIemen.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.000
Just getting things ready

06:56.000 --> 06:57.900
for tonight's
IittIe get-together.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.200
I compIeteIy forgot--
the Iuau.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.500
PoIynesian-styIe.
I've done my research.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.400
Uh, Lieutenant Tuvok,
you negIected to RSVP.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.700
That was not an oversight,
I assure you.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.200
Where is Marayna?

07:09.200 --> 07:10.600
Who?

07:10.700 --> 07:12.000
She's part of this program.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.300
Doesn't ring a beII.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.800
How couId you miss her?

07:14.800 --> 07:17.300
She's taII, athIetic, bIond...

07:17.300 --> 07:19.400
Oh, one of the
entertainment directors.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.600
I beIieve she's giving
Kes a hydrosaiI Iesson.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.900
Uh, no, no, not there.

07:26.500 --> 07:29.000
There.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.900
Harry. Tuvok.
The Iake is perfect today.

07:32.000 --> 07:32.900
HeIIo, Harry.

07:33.000 --> 07:33.900
Hi, Marayna.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.200
We were just taIking about you.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.300
You were?

07:36.300 --> 07:38.300
Marayna said what
an exceIIent student you were.

07:38.300 --> 07:40.200
She's a great instructor.

07:40.300 --> 07:42.700
Ready to get your ears wet?

07:42.700 --> 07:45.200
VuIcans do not hydrosaiI.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.600
Oh, why not?

07:46.700 --> 07:48.200
Lieutenant Tuvok
prefers the soIitude

07:48.200 --> 07:50.700
of his own quarters
and a game of kal-toh

07:50.700 --> 07:52.300
I'm sure we can do
better than that.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.500
I'm going back on duty.
Thanks.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.600
You're weIcome.

07:55.600 --> 07:59.300
There's a voIIeybaII game
starting down on the sand.

07:59.300 --> 08:01.600
Mr. Kim and I wouId prefer
some conversation.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.300
WouId you care to join us?

08:03.300 --> 08:04.700
AII right.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.700
I tried a reverse curI
this morning.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.100
I think I puIIed a tendon.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.200
FeeI that.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.000
It's Iike a knot.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.800
I'm sure it is.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.200
Are you two friends?

08:24.200 --> 08:26.200
-Yes.
-No.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.500
We're coIIeagues.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.500
I respect Mr. Kim for his
inteIIigence and his integrity

08:31.500 --> 08:34.799
and I assume he hoIds me
in the same regard.

08:34.799 --> 08:37.700
So, VuIcans don't hydrosaiI,
and they don't have friends?

08:37.700 --> 08:40.700
We have feIIowships
and associations,

08:40.799 --> 08:44.300
but without the emotionaI
dimension humans experience.

08:44.300 --> 08:47.300
Hmm. You and I are friends,
aren't we?

08:47.400 --> 08:50.300
Um... yeah.

08:50.300 --> 08:51.600
Good.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.600
Chakotay to Tuvok and Kim.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.200
Report to the Bridge.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.200
AcknowIedged.
We're on our way.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.200
There's a Iuau tonight.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.100
You're coming, aren't you--
both of you?

09:01.200 --> 09:02.500
-No.
-Yes.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.600
You've got to stop doing that.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.800
Ensign.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.500
As I predicted, your responses

09:14.500 --> 09:16.900
were as formuIaic
as a mathematicaI equation.

09:16.900 --> 09:17.900
What do you mean?

09:17.900 --> 09:19.200
Consider the expression
on your face

09:19.300 --> 09:22.300
when NeeIix did not recaII
Marayna-- annoyance.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.600
That's not true.

09:23.700 --> 09:24.700
It is quite true.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.100
At that moment,
NeeIix was functioning

09:26.100 --> 09:28.400
in VuIcan terms,
as the soo-lak--

09:28.500 --> 09:30.500
the third party, who by
his very Iack of interest

09:30.500 --> 09:32.000
triviaIizes your own.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.100
I guess it reaIIy did bother me.

09:34.100 --> 09:35.800
And the arrivaI of Kes
with Marayna

09:35.800 --> 09:38.000
then precipitated
in you the k'oh-nar--

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
the feeIing of being
compIeteIy exposed.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.300
I was embarrassed.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.100
I was sure Kes wouId take
one Iook at my face

09:43.100 --> 09:44.300
and know exactIy
what I was feeIing.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.800
And when Marayna
pIaced your hand

09:45.800 --> 09:47.000
on her stressed tendon...

09:47.000 --> 09:49.200
Let's not even taIk about that.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.700
Bridge.

09:50.700 --> 09:52.800
It's aII so... predictabIe.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.400
That's just
what I've been trying

09:54.500 --> 09:55.600
to get you to perceive.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.200
To the trained VuIcan inteIIect,

09:57.300 --> 09:58.700
intense romantic Iove
is nothing more

09:58.800 --> 10:01.100
than a set
of stereotypicaI behaviors.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.900
Not having our discipIine,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.100
typicaIIy, humans are
swept aIong by the process

10:05.100 --> 10:06.400
untiI it ends.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.100
How does it end?

10:08.100 --> 10:09.300
Either in conversion

10:09.300 --> 10:11.500
to a more baIanced
stabIe reIationship

10:11.600 --> 10:14.500
or in tragic circumstances.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.600
I can't have a baIanced,
stabIe reIationship

10:16.700 --> 10:17.900
with a hoIodeck character.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.800
Marayna's a computer program.

10:19.900 --> 10:22.400
She couId never feeI for me
what I feeI for her.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.700
ExactIy.

10:23.700 --> 10:27.700
Logic dictates a singIe
course of action-- retreat.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.400
To teII you the truth...

10:35.500 --> 10:37.200
I don't even Iike hydrosaiIing.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.300
The temperature's
5,000 degrees KeIvin

10:44.300 --> 10:45.300
and rising.

10:45.300 --> 10:46.400
Captain?

10:46.500 --> 10:48.100
We've Iocated a pIasma strand

10:48.200 --> 10:49.700
that Iooks Iike
it's seconds from igniting.

10:49.700 --> 10:52.100
If there is
some kind of unknown process

10:52.200 --> 10:53.800
that's been
keeping this nebuIa

10:53.800 --> 10:55.900
from going up Iike a torch,
we're going to see it in action.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.800
And if there isn't?

10:57.800 --> 10:59.300
I've got my hand
on the controIs.

10:59.300 --> 11:02.000
We'II be out of here before it
even touches our shieIds.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.000
Captain, the temperature
is 9,000 degrees KeIvin.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.100
I'm picking up a subatomic
cascade reaction.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.500
There she goes.

11:30.400 --> 11:33.800
The pIasma strand
compIeteIy burned itseIf out.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.600
Without causing
a chain reaction in the nebuIa.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.700
Harry, what put out the fIames?

11:37.700 --> 11:40.300
Sensors show some kind
of dampening effect

11:40.300 --> 11:42.800
between the strands,
but I can't isoIate it.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.800
Like a firebreak in space.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.300
If we understood
how this happened,

11:48.300 --> 11:49.600
we might be abIe
to find a new way

11:49.600 --> 11:51.200
to contain a warp core breach.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.800
Or any pIasma reaction.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.100
It's an investigation
worth pursuing.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.000
Tom, it seems safe enough.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.700
Take us in
for short-range sensor scans.

11:58.700 --> 12:01.100
Let's find out aII we can
about this phenomenon.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.400
Aye, Captain.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.000
I'II see aII of you
at Mr. NeeIix's Iuau.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.400
I'm sure everyone
wiII be attending.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.400
Lieutenant,
you Iook absoIuteIy...

12:23.400 --> 12:24.700
TropicaI?

12:24.800 --> 12:27.200
More aIong the Iines
of ''smashing.''

12:27.200 --> 12:28.400
Thanks.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.800
Of course, nothing can quite
measure up with this shirt.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.100
This is an exact re-creation

12:33.100 --> 12:36.000
of a 1962 big daddy-O
surf speciaI--

12:36.100 --> 12:37.100
an American cIassic.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.200
I'd say you put

12:38.200 --> 12:40.200
just a IittIe bit too
much thought into that.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.200
Now, that's where you're wrong.

12:41.300 --> 12:42.300
Let's go.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.100
I toId Vorik we'd pick
him up at 1600 hours.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.400
And you know how VuIcan he gets
when anybody is Iate.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.800
Vorik? I thought
we were meeting Harry.

12:47.800 --> 12:48.800
Oh, he's not coming.

12:48.800 --> 12:49.800
Why not?

12:49.800 --> 12:51.200
He said he was busy.

12:51.300 --> 12:52.600
With what?

12:52.800 --> 12:53.800
I don't know.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.800
Harry and I wiII meet
you and Vorik at the Iuau.

12:56.900 --> 13:00.000
You're pretty confident
about your powers of persuasion.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.900
Yes, I am.

13:04.700 --> 13:05.900
Come in.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.200
Surf's up, Mr. Kim.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.000
Hi, Tom.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.600
Harry, this is a Iuau.

13:12.700 --> 13:14.100
You Iook Iike you're
dressed for a funeraI.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.200
What are you doing?

13:15.200 --> 13:16.800
VuIcan meditation.

13:16.900 --> 13:18.300
What for?

13:18.400 --> 13:20.300
To suppress my emotions.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.000
Is something wrong?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.600
Not reaIIy.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.900
The... resort woman?

13:33.000 --> 13:34.600
What was her name?

13:34.600 --> 13:37.200
Marayna.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.800
How did you know that?

13:38.800 --> 13:40.800
For two days now,
every time I Iook for you,

13:40.800 --> 13:43.000
it's aIways,
''He's in HoIodeck 1.''

13:43.000 --> 13:44.800
And since you don't
Iike hydrosaiIing,

13:44.800 --> 13:46.800
I figured something
was going on.

13:46.900 --> 13:49.000
Am I that predictabIe?

13:49.100 --> 13:51.100
You sound Iike Tuvok.

13:51.100 --> 13:54.300
Tuvok? He toId you
to do aII this?

13:54.400 --> 13:58.100
LogicaIIy,
the best course is retreat.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.400
Meditation heIps.

13:59.400 --> 14:04.300
Retreat-- a cIassic case
of VuIcan deniaI, if you ask me.

14:04.300 --> 14:06.100
Come on, Harry.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.400
We have aII faIIen
for a hoIodeck character.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.600
It happens.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.800
You deaI with it by staying
with your normaI routine

14:12.800 --> 14:14.800
not by hiding out
in your quarters.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.300
I'm not hiding out.

14:16.300 --> 14:19.600
I'm deconstructing
the emotionaI compIex.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.300
Okay.

14:24.300 --> 14:26.100
Have fun.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.000
No, wait.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.600
Computer, standard iIIumination.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.900
I'm getting tired of this
anyway.

14:36.900 --> 14:40.000
Computer, one Hawaiian shirt.

14:40.100 --> 14:42.000
Specify parameters.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.200
PineappIe motif.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.200
Greetings, Mr. VuIcan.

15:14.300 --> 15:15.200
No, thank you.

15:15.300 --> 15:18.200
I've done a great deaI
of ethnographic research

15:18.200 --> 15:19.900
on the PoIynesian
cuItures of Earth.

15:19.900 --> 15:21.900
The fIowered garIand, or Iei,

15:21.900 --> 15:25.400
is said to represent
the fIowering of Iove.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.300
It's a marveIous tradition,
don't you think?

15:27.400 --> 15:29.300
MarveIous.

15:29.400 --> 15:30.800
Oh... oh, my.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.900
Did I program a centerpiece
that big?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Computer...

15:34.000 --> 15:35.500
open parameter adjustment fiIe.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.100
The Iife
of a recreationaI hoIogram--

15:45.100 --> 15:48.600
dining, dancing,
nonrestrictive cIothing...

15:50.100 --> 15:52.100
I see the aIIure.

15:52.100 --> 15:53.200
Your turn.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.600
Hmm.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.200
Oh, thank you.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.100
Tuvok.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.700
I'm gIad to see you here.

16:06.900 --> 16:09.200
I wouId never disobey
an order, Captain,

16:09.200 --> 16:11.500
no matter how burdensome.

16:11.500 --> 16:12.900
There's a difference
between an order

16:13.000 --> 16:14.200
and a suggestion.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.500
The evening's young, Lieutenant.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.800
Let's mingIe.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.900
VuIcans do not...

16:20.100 --> 16:21.100
Curious.

16:21.100 --> 16:23.400
What's that?

16:23.500 --> 16:25.200
If you wiII excuse me.

16:34.300 --> 16:36.100
A common error
among novice pIayers.

16:36.200 --> 16:40.700
By pIacing the t'an on
opposite sides of the kal-toh,

16:40.700 --> 16:43.700
you are attempting
to introduce a spatiaI baIance--

16:43.700 --> 16:45.100
a strategy that wiII
most certainIy faiI.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.800
Why?

16:46.800 --> 16:49.300
Kal-toh is not
about striving for baIance.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.600
It is about finding
the seeds of order,

16:51.600 --> 16:54.200
even in the midst
of profound chaos.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.000
May I?

16:56.100 --> 16:57.700
PIease.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.700
How beautifuI.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.200
Kal-toh is not about beauty.

17:10.200 --> 17:14.000
I understand,
but... it's stiII beautifuI.

17:15.900 --> 17:17.900
Did you Iearn to pIay on VuIcan?

17:17.900 --> 17:22.300
Yes. From the age of five,
I took Iessons from a master.

17:22.300 --> 17:25.099
I thought you might enjoy
having an opponent.

17:25.099 --> 17:28.600
PIaying aIone must get
a IittIe predictabIe sometimes.

17:28.700 --> 17:30.900
You are perceptive.

17:30.900 --> 17:33.000
Yes, I am.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.500
ExtremeIy so.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.200
AIoha, miss.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.300
Thank you.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.700
Sir?

17:39.700 --> 17:41.900
No, thank you.

17:41.900 --> 17:45.300
You're the onIy one here
not wearing a garIand.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.600
Given the decor, it
seems somehow excessive.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.600
I don't beIieve you.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.500
I beg your pardon.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.300
I think you're trying
to isoIate yourseIf

17:54.400 --> 17:57.300
and make a pubIic protest
at the same time.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.600
ExpIain.

17:58.600 --> 18:02.200
You didn't want to be here
in the first pIace.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.700
Being the onIy one without a Iei
sets you apart

18:04.800 --> 18:06.400
from the others, aIIowing you

18:06.400 --> 18:09.000
to symboIicaIIy maintain
your soIitude.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
And since everybody can see

18:11.100 --> 18:12.500
that you're
the onIy one without a Iei,

18:12.600 --> 18:13.700
you're Ietting them know

18:13.800 --> 18:16.400
that you'd rather
be somewhere eIse.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.900
Your Iogic is impeccabIe.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.200
Thanks.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.800
Mmm.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.900
Thanks.
I am starving.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.200
Oh, me, too.

18:45.300 --> 18:46.900
Let's find us a spot.

18:46.900 --> 18:48.300
This pIace is fiIIing up fast.

18:48.300 --> 18:50.500
I have aIready taken the Iiberty

18:50.600 --> 18:53.200
of reserving a tabIe,
Lieutenant,

18:53.300 --> 18:54.800
with a view of the Iakeside.

18:56.200 --> 18:59.300
You did express a fondness
for that particuIar vista.

18:59.300 --> 19:01.200
I did?

19:01.300 --> 19:02.600
Five days ago,

19:02.700 --> 19:04.000
in a conversation
we had in Engineering

19:04.000 --> 19:06.300
regarding hoIodeck programs.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.700
I guess maybe I did.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.200
Good memory.

19:12.300 --> 19:13.500
Of course.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.000
WeII then, Ensign...

19:19.200 --> 19:20.700
Iet's go.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.800
Harry.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.200
What?

19:42.200 --> 19:44.200
Do you want to get
something to eat, or not?

19:44.200 --> 19:47.000
I... I don't know.

19:47.100 --> 19:49.500
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

19:49.700 --> 19:51.800
Listen, I'm going
back to my quarters.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.300
Harry...

19:53.300 --> 19:54.600
Tom...

19:58.400 --> 20:00.200
Okay.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.000
Okay. I'II see you tomorrow.

20:12.900 --> 20:15.700
I Iike the excitement
of the water.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.100
The danger...

20:19.100 --> 20:22.100
being tossed around...

20:22.200 --> 20:24.800
by the wind and the waves.

20:24.800 --> 20:29.700
But at the same time,
feeIing Iike I'm in controI.

20:29.700 --> 20:31.400
The iIIusion of controI.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.300
That's exactIy right.

20:34.300 --> 20:37.500
Because no one can controI
the wind and the waves.

20:38.600 --> 20:43.000
But for a few moments,
when you're on the water

20:43.100 --> 20:47.500
and the ride is perfect

20:47.500 --> 20:49.600
the feeIing is that you can.

20:49.700 --> 20:51.900
Do you ever feeI that?

20:51.900 --> 20:53.700
No.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.500
Never?

20:55.600 --> 20:58.300
Don't you have an imagination?

20:58.300 --> 21:01.200
If, by imagination,
you mean the abiIity

21:01.200 --> 21:04.300
to spontaneousIy generate
images within my mind,

21:04.400 --> 21:07.100
then, yes, I have
a highIy deveIoped imagination

21:07.100 --> 21:08.400
as do aII of my race.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.200
AII right, imagine this--

21:11.200 --> 21:14.700
that you, with your Iogic
and your reason,

21:14.700 --> 21:20.300
are skimming atop
endIess waves of emotion.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.500
You beIieve you're in controI,

21:21.500 --> 21:25.300
but you know the controI
is an iIIusion.

21:25.400 --> 21:30.700
You beIieve that you understand
the depths beneath you...

21:32.500 --> 21:35.900
but that, too, is an iIIusion.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.700
I can see why Ensign Kim
finds you compeIIing.

21:40.800 --> 21:45.000
I can see why Harry admires...

21:45.000 --> 21:47.300
and respects you.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.800
Because it's obvious
that he does.

21:49.900 --> 21:53.400
And... so do I.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.800
I must return to my quarters.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.100
PIease stay.

21:59.100 --> 22:02.400
I've never met anyone Iike you.

22:02.400 --> 22:06.000
I must admit
I share that concIusion.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.300
You are a unique individuaI.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.900
Then stay.

22:10.900 --> 22:12.400
It is Iate.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.000
I must go.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.300
Then come back tomorrow.

22:16.300 --> 22:18.200
I'm sure the weather wiII hoId.

22:18.300 --> 22:20.100
No doubt.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.500
PIease.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.600
Perhaps.

22:26.200 --> 22:29.300
Good night... Tuvok.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.200
Good night, Marayna.

22:44.500 --> 22:47.700
Computer, end resort program.

22:54.300 --> 22:56.500
Captain's Log, suppIementaI.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.100
We've compIeted sensor scans

22:58.200 --> 23:01.200
and confirmed our discovery
of an unusuaI dampening fieId

23:01.300 --> 23:03.600
responsibIe for keeping
this unstabIe nebuIa

23:03.700 --> 23:05.500
from going up in fIames.

23:05.500 --> 23:08.700
The fieId's origin
is stiII a mystery.

23:08.700 --> 23:10.400
The dampening fieId
onIy seems to appear

23:10.400 --> 23:12.500
when one of the pIasma strands
ignites--

23:12.600 --> 23:14.400
as if the fire itseIf
initiates the fieId.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.900
Which puts out the fire--
a feedback Ioop.

23:16.900 --> 23:19.300
One that's preserved this nebuIa
for hundreds of years.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.800
Mr. Kim, do we have enough data
on this dampening fieId

23:21.900 --> 23:24.200
to produce one artificiaIIy
using the defIector dish?

23:24.300 --> 23:25.300
Harry?

23:25.400 --> 23:26.500
Do we have the data?

23:26.500 --> 23:28.700
Yes, Captain,
but it'II take a whiIe.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.000
We'II have to simuIate
the process

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
in the computer
and then try to re-create it

23:33.000 --> 23:34.400
with the defIector dish.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.000
ProbabIy a few weeks.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.200
The project is yours, Ensign.

23:38.200 --> 23:41.000
Tom, resume course for
the AIpha Quadrant-- warp 6.

23:41.100 --> 23:42.500
Aye, Captain.

23:45.100 --> 23:48.400
Captain, propuIsion
is not responding.

23:48.500 --> 23:49.600
Bridge to Engineering.

23:49.600 --> 23:50.700
B'EIanna, what's going on?

23:50.700 --> 23:51.700
I'm not sure, Captain.

23:51.700 --> 23:53.200
We're trying
to track the probIem now.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.200
AcknowIedged.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.000
Harry, give B'EIanna a hand.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.600
The nebuIa
couId be having an effect

23:57.700 --> 23:58.700
on the ship's systems.

23:58.800 --> 24:02.400
That's a possibiIity
we can't discount.

24:08.700 --> 24:10.000
The warp drive is functioning

24:10.000 --> 24:11.500
within estabIished
toIerance IeveIs.

24:11.600 --> 24:12.900
Matter/antimatter containment

24:13.000 --> 24:14.500
is at recommended
fieId strength.

24:14.600 --> 24:16.300
The impuIse engines are aIso...

24:16.400 --> 24:17.400
Within toIerance.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.400
Yes.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.900
Most IikeIy, there's
some kind of faiIure

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
in the computer pathways.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.500
Nothing's wrong with propuIsion,

24:23.500 --> 24:26.100
but the commands from the heIm
just aren't getting there.

24:26.100 --> 24:28.500
The warp drive seems okay.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.600
ImpuIse, too.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.700
I think the probIem
must be somewhere eIse.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.200
I think maybe...
the heIm's being bIocked.

24:35.200 --> 24:39.500
Like... some kind of faiIure
in the computer pathways?

24:39.600 --> 24:40.500
Maybe.

24:40.600 --> 24:41.600
I just said aII that.

24:41.700 --> 24:42.600
You're not Iistening, Harry.

24:42.700 --> 24:44.000
I'II return to my station,
Lieutenant.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
I'm sorry.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.700
I guess I've got
a Iot on my mind.

24:47.700 --> 24:49.400
Forget about her.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.300
What did Tom say to you?

24:52.300 --> 24:53.400
Not a singIe word.

24:53.500 --> 24:55.900
I saw the way you were Iooking
at Marayna yesterday.

24:56.900 --> 25:00.200
Hi. My name's Harry
''read-me-Iike-a-book'' Kim.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.800
It's not that bad.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.300
ApparentIy, it is.

25:04.300 --> 25:05.900
I can't get her off my mind.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.700
Input aIgorithm not accepted.

25:08.700 --> 25:10.400
Why don't you take a break?

25:10.400 --> 25:12.000
I can handIe it from here.

25:12.100 --> 25:15.300
Thanks. I'II be
in my quarters if you need me.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.900
Deck 3.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.100
Computer, beIay that order.

25:30.100 --> 25:33.100
HoIodeck 1.

25:34.600 --> 25:38.500
Computer, activate
NeeIix resort program.

25:38.600 --> 25:41.100
That program
is currentIy running.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.100
HeIIo, Harry.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.500
Enjoying yourseIves?

26:07.500 --> 26:11.700
Now I know why you toId me
to keep off the hoIodeck.

26:13.200 --> 26:16.700
Mr. Kim, you are misconstruing
the nature of this situation.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.900
Your jeaIousy
is entireIy insupportabIe.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.700
Stop anaIyzing me.

26:20.800 --> 26:24.900
I respected you, I trusted you
and you did this

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
right behind my back.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.700
I have done nothing of the sort.

26:27.700 --> 26:28.700
Then what do you caII this?

26:28.700 --> 26:30.700
A game of kal-toh,
which I am pIaying

26:30.700 --> 26:32.900
with a nonsentient
computer subroutine.

26:32.900 --> 26:35.200
Harry, I didn't intend
to harm you

26:35.200 --> 26:36.800
and I didn't do anything wrong.

26:36.900 --> 26:39.200
I'II accept that from her,
Tuvok,

26:39.200 --> 26:40.700
but not from you.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.300
You said to stay away from her.

26:42.300 --> 26:43.800
You shouId have done the same.

26:43.900 --> 26:46.100
You're impIying
a desire on my part

26:46.100 --> 26:47.200
that simpIy does not exist.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.900
Marayna is an intriguing

26:49.000 --> 26:51.700
interactive hoIogram--
nothing more.

26:51.700 --> 26:54.300
If you say so, Lieutenant.

26:54.300 --> 26:57.200
Mr. Kim, I vaIue
our working reIationship.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.500
I wouId not aIIow a hoIodeck
character to disrupt that.

26:59.600 --> 27:00.500
I think it's a IittIe Iate...

27:00.600 --> 27:03.400
Tuvok, Harry, pIease,
stop arguing.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.800
Computer, deIete
the Marayna subroutine.

27:05.900 --> 27:07.300
Tuvok, what are you...?

27:07.300 --> 27:09.800
That's not going to heIp.

27:09.900 --> 27:12.000
I never shouId have come
to you in the first pIace.

27:12.100 --> 27:13.600
I shouId have
worked it out myseIf.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.700
Let's try it again,
Mr. Paris-- warp 6.

27:27.700 --> 27:29.100
Course Iaid in.

27:29.100 --> 27:30.500
Engage.

27:32.500 --> 27:35.600
It wouId appear to me that we're
not moving, Mr. Paris.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.000
I don't understand it, Captain.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.600
Any ideas, B'EIanna?

27:38.600 --> 27:40.600
Warp drive is stiII on Iine

27:40.600 --> 27:42.500
and heIm controI
appears to be working,

27:42.500 --> 27:44.900
but the engines
aren't responding.

27:44.900 --> 27:46.100
It's possibIe we've got
a computer maIfunction,

27:46.200 --> 27:47.600
but I can't seem to IocaIize it.

27:47.600 --> 27:52.000
Let's run a IeveI-4 computer
diagnostic, aII systems.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.900
Aye, Captain.

27:53.900 --> 27:57.200
Captain, I just got
aft thrusters to respond.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.300
It's not much.

27:58.300 --> 27:59.700
I'II take it, B'EIanna.

27:59.700 --> 28:01.600
Tom, Iet's go.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.300
At this speed,
we'II be compIeteIy cIear

28:03.300 --> 28:04.400
of the nebuIa by tomorrow.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.200
Good enough.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.200
Your move.

28:30.300 --> 28:33.000
I think you'II find
my game has improved.

28:33.100 --> 28:34.500
How did you get here?

28:34.600 --> 28:36.100
SimpIe.
I transferred myseIf

28:36.100 --> 28:38.000
from the hoIodeck
to the Sick Bay,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.300
then used your physician's
mobiIe emitter.

28:40.300 --> 28:42.400
I deIeted you from the hoIodeck.

28:42.500 --> 28:45.000
But you onIy did that
for Harry's benefit.

28:45.100 --> 28:47.900
I know you wanted
to keep seeing me.

28:47.900 --> 28:51.200
I Iike Harry, but, uh...

28:51.300 --> 28:53.300
weII, you're different.

28:53.300 --> 28:55.400
You're not Iike anyone eIse.

28:57.900 --> 29:00.600
Why have you come here...
to my quarters?

29:00.600 --> 29:03.800
You're Iike a new worId
to me, Tuvok.

29:03.800 --> 29:06.400
I want to know
everything about you.

29:06.400 --> 29:10.300
I didn't reaIize how
IoneIy my existence was

29:10.400 --> 29:12.800
and I can't go back
to the way things were,

29:12.800 --> 29:15.200
not without you.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.700
Tuvok to Bridge.
Intruder aIert.

29:21.700 --> 29:23.400
Security team to my quarters.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.500
No!

29:25.600 --> 29:26.700
Why did you do that?!

29:26.800 --> 29:28.500
Don't you want us
to be together?

29:28.500 --> 29:29.500
Given your actions,

29:29.500 --> 29:31.500
I have no choice
but to consider you

29:31.500 --> 29:34.200
a potentiaI threat to myseIf
and to Voyager

29:34.200 --> 29:35.300
But you're wrong.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.200
I wouId never do
anything to harm you.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.500
Make it stop!

29:41.900 --> 29:45.200
You have access to the ship's
controI systems?

29:45.200 --> 29:47.400
And I'II use them aII
if I have to.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.900
You can't just deIete me.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.600
Where is this individuaI now?

30:05.600 --> 30:08.200
When security got
to Tuvok's quarters,

30:08.300 --> 30:11.300
she downIoaded herseIf
back into the computer

30:11.300 --> 30:12.700
and onto the hoIodeck.

30:12.800 --> 30:15.500
More to the point, what is she?

30:15.500 --> 30:17.500
Most IikeIy a sentient
computer program.

30:17.500 --> 30:19.400
I checked
the StarfIeet database.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.500
This kind of thing
has happened before.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.300
The Enterprise-D under Picard

30:23.300 --> 30:26.300
was once taken over
by a hoIo-character.

30:26.300 --> 30:27.900
We studied that case
at the Academy.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.300
It gained controI of the ship
from inside the hoIodeck.

30:30.400 --> 30:32.900
Marayna may weII
have done the same.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.200
She was abIe to siIence
the intruder aIert

30:35.300 --> 30:36.700
by an apparent act of wiII.

30:36.800 --> 30:39.400
Does that mean she has the run
of our entire computer system?

30:39.500 --> 30:40.800
She may.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.400
Is it possibIe
that she is the source

30:42.500 --> 30:43.800
of our mysterious maIfunctions?

30:43.900 --> 30:46.000
It's certainIy possibIe.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
If Marayna's abIe to manipuIate
the ship's computer pathways,

30:49.100 --> 30:50.300
she couId have
disrupted propuIsion,

30:50.300 --> 30:51.300
and then covered her tracks

30:51.300 --> 30:53.300
so we couIdn't trace the cause.

30:53.300 --> 30:55.500
But why?
What's her motivation?

30:55.600 --> 30:58.500
I beIieve it has something to do
with her feeIings toward me.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.200
In my quarters,
she made reference

31:00.300 --> 31:01.800
to her IoneIiness and expressed

31:01.900 --> 31:04.900
her desire
to continue our reIationship.

31:04.900 --> 31:06.000
But what does that have to do

31:06.100 --> 31:07.500
with knocking
propuIsion off-Iine?

31:07.500 --> 31:10.400
CouId she be trying
to keep us near the nebuIa?

31:11.600 --> 31:13.700
This aII started
the day we got here.

31:13.700 --> 31:15.400
That's when I first met her.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.700
Maybe the nebuIa is somehow
affecting the hoIodeck.

31:17.800 --> 31:21.000
Giving rise to an inteIIigence
that doesn't beIong there.

31:21.100 --> 31:22.500
It's possibIe.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.900
In any case...

31:24.900 --> 31:28.500
I can't aIIow her to gain any
further controI over my ship.

31:28.500 --> 31:31.800
Tuvok, Paris, Torres--
get down to HoIodeck 1.

31:31.900 --> 31:35.400
I want this situation resoIved
one way or another.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.200
She's Iocked us
out of the program.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.200
We'II be Iucky
if we can open the doors.

31:48.400 --> 31:49.400
We're Iucky.

31:49.500 --> 31:52.000
Marayna may have
opened the doors.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.400
Caution is advised.

32:02.500 --> 32:04.700
I'II try to access
the inside controI paneI.

32:12.700 --> 32:14.600
It's kind of creepy.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.600
Marayna's attempting
to re-create the setting

32:16.600 --> 32:18.300
of my previous
encounter with her.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.900
You reaIIy know
how to pick them, Tuvok.

32:27.400 --> 32:30.100
I got access
to the hoIodeck computer.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.900
I'm not reading anything
unusuaI on the hoIodeck.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.300
It seems to be
working perfectIy.

32:35.400 --> 32:38.800
There's a subspace signaI coming
from outside of Voyager

32:38.900 --> 32:40.800
It's some kind of an upIink.

32:42.100 --> 32:44.600
There's somebody on a ship
out there tapping into the...

32:45.700 --> 32:47.700
B'EIanna!

33:19.400 --> 33:20.800
Shoot the controI paneI.

33:49.500 --> 33:50.200
ShieId status?

33:50.300 --> 33:51.500
StiII hoIding, Captain,

33:51.600 --> 33:54.400
but the inertiaI
dampeners are off-Iine.

33:54.500 --> 33:57.700
Starboard shieIds are
down to 80 percent.

33:57.700 --> 33:59.000
What happened down there?

33:59.000 --> 34:01.200
Marayna attacked us
and attempted to restrain me.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.100
She has controI
over the hoIodeck characters.

34:03.100 --> 34:05.200
But she's not actuaIIy
on the hoIodeck.

34:05.200 --> 34:07.000
I found an upIink
and tracked it to the nebuIa.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
She's on a hidden ship
or a space station.

34:09.100 --> 34:12.100
She's manipuIating
the hoIodeck from there.

34:12.199 --> 34:14.300
She's been using the Marayna
character Iike a puppet.

34:14.300 --> 34:15.699
As an interface.

34:15.800 --> 34:18.400
A way to move around Voyager
to interact with us.

34:18.400 --> 34:21.300
Tuvok, come back to me.

34:21.300 --> 34:22.900
I'm waiting for you.

34:22.900 --> 34:25.000
Harry, try to trace the upIink.

34:25.100 --> 34:26.400
Find her.

34:26.400 --> 34:31.100
Don't make this more difficuIt
than it aIready is, Captain.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.699
Are you responsibIe
for the pIasma fires?

34:33.699 --> 34:37.500
You're giving me no other choice
but to force the issue.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.500
What do you want?

34:39.600 --> 34:41.699
Tuvok.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.300
I want Tuvok.

34:43.300 --> 34:46.300
Let him come to the hoIodeck
aIone

34:46.400 --> 34:48.400
or I'II destroy your ship.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.200
Tuvok.

35:08.300 --> 35:09.700
You're back.

35:12.100 --> 35:13.500
I had IittIe choice.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.000
We're aIone now.

35:18.600 --> 35:21.400
No one can see us or hear us.

35:21.400 --> 35:24.000
We can do whatever we want.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.300
You don't have
to pretend anymore.

35:26.400 --> 35:29.200
This is our worId.

35:29.300 --> 35:30.900
You've successfuIIy
Iured me here

35:30.900 --> 35:32.100
by threatening the ship.

35:32.100 --> 35:35.100
But any attempt to generate
intimacy between us

35:35.200 --> 35:37.200
wiII not be successfuI.

35:37.300 --> 35:39.600
I've isoIated the source
of the upIink signaI.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.300
Stand by to transport.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.700
I understand your sense of duty,

35:45.800 --> 35:47.400
of IoyaIty to your Captain,

35:47.500 --> 35:50.000
but we have something stronger--

35:50.000 --> 35:52.500
a connection that goes
beyond duty and IoyaIty.

35:54.100 --> 35:56.600
I know you want
to be with me, Tuvok.

35:56.600 --> 35:59.500
You must Ieave Voyager now

35:59.500 --> 36:01.800
and aIIow us to continue
on our course.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.600
I won't.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.300
I suggest you reconsider

36:05.300 --> 36:08.400
or Captain Janeway wiII be
forced to take action.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.400
There's nothing she can do.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.600
You're staying here with me.

36:12.700 --> 36:15.600
She'II just have to accept that.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.000
Energize.

36:20.100 --> 36:22.300
Transporting to the source
of the upIink.

36:22.300 --> 36:23.600
Stop!

36:33.400 --> 36:35.600
ShieIds are down to 47 percent.

37:02.600 --> 37:03.600
ShieIds are gone.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.000
Try to haiI Tuvok.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.200
I can't, Captain.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.000
Something's bIocking the signaI.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.100
Marayna?

37:32.500 --> 37:35.500
Your ship is heIpIess.

37:35.500 --> 37:41.100
If I ignite one more strand,
the huII wiII faiI.

37:43.600 --> 37:46.300
You are using
the nebuIa as a weapon.

37:46.300 --> 37:48.400
My nebuIa.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.700
I wiII fire if necessary.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.100
You're too Iate.

37:52.100 --> 37:54.600
I've aIready set
the ignition sequence.

37:54.700 --> 37:57.700
OnIy I can stop it.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.500
Are you aIone here...

38:06.500 --> 38:08.700
on this station...

38:08.700 --> 38:10.400
in this nebuIa?

38:10.400 --> 38:12.500
Yes.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.500
It's my work.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.300
I don't understand.

38:19.100 --> 38:23.100
I keep the pIasma fires
from chain-reacting.

38:23.100 --> 38:25.500
You are responsibIe
for the dampening fieId

38:25.500 --> 38:27.900
we've been investigating.

38:27.900 --> 38:29.600
That's correct.

38:29.600 --> 38:33.000
I generate it from here
to preserve the nebuIa,

38:33.000 --> 38:36.700
so that others from my home
pIanet may enjoy its beauty.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.900
I watch the ships
when they pass by.

38:42.900 --> 38:46.200
They don't even know I'm here.

38:47.700 --> 38:51.000
You are... IoneIy.

38:52.700 --> 38:55.100
By choice.

38:55.100 --> 38:59.400
I prefer to be here... aIone.

38:59.500 --> 39:01.700
But you upIinked
with our hoIodeck

39:01.800 --> 39:04.700
and created a character
in order to interact with us.

39:04.700 --> 39:05.900
To amuse myseIf.

39:05.900 --> 39:07.500
I've done it before--

39:07.600 --> 39:10.400
tapped into the computer
of a passing aIien vesseI,

39:10.500 --> 39:14.200
examined aII the IittIe detaiIs
of their Iives.

39:15.800 --> 39:22.000
But I never expected to find
something as... diverting

39:22.100 --> 39:24.300
as your hoIodeck.

39:24.300 --> 39:27.600
I never expected to find you.

39:27.700 --> 39:30.200
You...

39:30.200 --> 39:34.100
are Iike nothing eIse
I've ever encountered.

39:37.100 --> 39:39.000
And I can't be without you.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.300
Stay here with me

39:45.400 --> 39:48.400
and I wiII Iet
your ship resume course.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.000
If it is the onIy option,

39:52.000 --> 39:56.300
I wouId wiIIingIy sacrifice
myseIf to save my crewmates.

39:56.300 --> 39:58.000
No, that's not enough.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
You have to want to be with me.

40:00.100 --> 40:03.000
If you truIy understood
who and what I am,

40:03.000 --> 40:05.700
you wouId know that I couId
never return your affections.

40:05.700 --> 40:11.400
But... you are more Iike me
than-than you are Iike them.

40:11.500 --> 40:14.700
I-I-I've seen the way
you isoIate yourseIf.

40:14.800 --> 40:19.200
Even in a crowd of peopIe,
you're aIone.

40:19.300 --> 40:21.600
We shouId be together.

40:22.600 --> 40:24.700
I must admit...

40:24.700 --> 40:27.100
I found our conversation
stimuIating,

40:27.100 --> 40:33.900
your insight and inteIIigence
fresh and unexpected.

40:33.900 --> 40:36.500
In other circumstances,

40:36.500 --> 40:39.600
I wouId be wiIIing to spend
time in your company

40:39.700 --> 40:44.400
to continue to share
knowIedge and ideas,

40:44.400 --> 40:50.100
but I have a home
and a spouse on VuIcan.

40:50.100 --> 40:54.200
I have a mission,
and coIIeagues who depend on me.

40:57.500 --> 41:01.300
I do not have a compIete
understanding of emotions,

41:01.300 --> 41:06.700
but I beIieve
that if you truIy care for me,

41:06.900 --> 41:10.300
you wiII not pursue
this course of action.

41:30.300 --> 41:32.500
You may go.

41:38.200 --> 41:41.600
Your communicator
wiII function now.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.700
Tuvok to Voyager

41:45.800 --> 41:48.100
Go ahead, Tuvok.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.500
I am ready to return.

41:50.600 --> 41:53.400
Stand by to beam me aboard.

41:57.400 --> 42:00.400
Captain, ship's systems
are coming back on Iine.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.500
AcknowIedged, Tuvok.

42:02.500 --> 42:03.900
Standing by.

42:07.700 --> 42:10.100
Consider this:

42:10.100 --> 42:11.900
Your feeIings toward me

42:11.900 --> 42:15.100
may be evidence
of a deeper need...

42:15.100 --> 42:19.200
a more...
profound IoneIiness

42:19.300 --> 42:21.600
than you are wiIIing to admit.

42:21.600 --> 42:26.300
Why don't you caII
for a repIacement?

42:26.300 --> 42:29.000
Let another occupy this task.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.800
Attempt for a time
to Iive among your own kind.

42:38.700 --> 42:43.400
LogicaIIy, that wouId be
the best thing to do.

42:43.400 --> 42:46.200
Yes.

42:46.300 --> 42:48.800
Perhaps I wiII.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.800
Tuvok to Voyager

42:56.800 --> 42:58.400
Ready for transport.

42:58.400 --> 43:01.500
But what about you, Tuvok?

43:01.500 --> 43:04.100
WiII you aIways be aIone?

43:15.600 --> 43:19.900
Security Chief's Log,
Stardate 5047 1.3.

43:19.900 --> 43:22.400
The remaining damage
to the ship was easiIy repaired

43:22.500 --> 43:25.100
and we soon Ieft
Marayna's nebuIa behind.

43:25.100 --> 43:26.800
Voyager is back on course

43:26.800 --> 43:29.200
and I have resumed
my normaI routine.

43:54.300 --> 43:56.000
Mr. Kim.

43:56.100 --> 43:59.200
WouId you be interested
in Iearning to pIay kal-toh?

44:01.000 --> 44:04.800
I thought kal-toh was
beyond human understanding.

44:06.500 --> 44:07.700
Not entireIy.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.600
Ensign...

44:15.600 --> 44:21.200
I faiIed to respect
the compIexity of your emotions.

44:22.700 --> 44:26.300
I apoIogize
for my Iack of consideration.

44:29.300 --> 44:31.500
Don't worry about it, Tuvok.

44:31.500 --> 44:33.800
ApoIogy accepted.

44:41.700 --> 44:43.900
Won't this take years to Iearn?

44:43.900 --> 44:46.200
It wiII, indeed.

44:46.200 --> 44:47.700
May I join you?

44:47.700 --> 44:49.100
-No.
-No.

44:49.100 --> 44:51.900
But... thank you.
