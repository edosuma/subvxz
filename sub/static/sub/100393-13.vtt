WEBVTT

00:07.224 --> 00:08.443
Previously on "All Rise"...

00:08.486 --> 00:09.835
We finally have
a judge who's fair.

00:09.879 --> 00:11.794
I don't know what I'd do
if we didn't have her.

00:11.837 --> 00:13.926
I was wondering if Ms. Kansky
was gonna drop by.

00:13.970 --> 00:15.145
He likes you!

00:15.189 --> 00:18.235
I don't do cheer
during work hours.

00:18.279 --> 00:22.196
If I have questions about
gaining another perspective,

00:22.239 --> 00:24.415
might that be all right?
- Yes.

00:24.459 --> 00:25.982
It might be weird,
us showing up together.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.418
Two weeks ago, you kissed me
in front of all your friends.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.116
But not the whole courthouse.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.813
I haven't tried
a murder case in a while.

00:30.856 --> 00:32.075
So? You're the best lawyer
I know, Amy.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.077
Best lawyer in L.A.
is my son,

00:34.121 --> 00:35.905
and he chooses
not to represent me.

00:35.948 --> 00:37.559
Take responsibility
for your situation.

00:37.602 --> 00:39.256
I didn't do anything.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.649
I don't believe you.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

01:06.718 --> 01:09.460
Ya, ya, sepÃ¡ranse. SepÃ¡ranse.

01:09.504 --> 01:11.288
Be with you in a minute,
Ms. Lopez!

01:11.332 --> 01:12.507
Mike, good job.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.030
Let's go!
Game on!

01:16.728 --> 01:18.208
Hey.

01:18.252 --> 01:19.644
They're all gang members,
FDS?

01:19.688 --> 01:21.081
- Yeah.
- And you're the coach?

01:21.124 --> 01:23.518
You kidding?
No, I organize the games,

01:23.561 --> 01:25.520
bring the equipment,
cold drinks.

01:25.563 --> 01:27.130
Gives me a chance to show 'em
there's more to life

01:27.174 --> 01:28.697
besides colors and territories,
you know?

01:28.740 --> 01:30.699
- That's amazing, Alex.
- Hard to believe, right?

01:30.742 --> 01:32.527
Pssh. Come a long way.

01:32.570 --> 01:34.268
Yeah, I'm done
with that life, Ms. Lopez.

01:34.311 --> 01:37.053
I've got a job.
I'm a peace ambassador now.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.315
Anyone wants to step back
from the life,

01:38.359 --> 01:40.100
organizing things like this

01:40.143 --> 01:41.927
helps them know
where to find me.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.799
I'm proud of you.

01:45.931 --> 01:47.542
There's a kid
I want you to meet.

01:47.585 --> 01:48.499
He was in FDS,
but he's out now.

01:48.543 --> 01:50.110
He's trying.
He's a good kid.

01:50.153 --> 01:52.677
I can't be his lawyer.
Alex, they have to assign me.

01:52.721 --> 01:55.158
I'm a P.D.He just has some questions,
that's it.

01:55.202 --> 01:58.161
What kind of questions?If something is a crime
or isn't.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.250
A specific thing. I'll let him
tell you about it.

02:00.294 --> 02:01.469
Which one is he?He's not here.

02:01.512 --> 02:03.297
He's back at my place.
It's not far.

02:05.777 --> 02:08.039
You need to hurry.

02:08.084 --> 02:10.304
Construction at LAX
is a nightmare.

02:10.347 --> 02:11.957
Reading for the plane.

02:12.001 --> 02:14.699
It's a red eye, Sherri.
I am going to be sleeping.

02:14.743 --> 02:16.048
Also, your puffy.

02:16.092 --> 02:18.355
They have winter
in Washington.

02:18.399 --> 02:20.183
I'm flying to D.C.
to talk to my husband.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.793
- Can you believe that?
- Also have drinks.

02:21.837 --> 02:24.448
And have drinks with his people,
but really just to talk.

02:24.492 --> 02:26.494
You spend all your time
texting and on Skype.

02:26.537 --> 02:28.496
You can't have
an actual conversation.

02:28.539 --> 02:32.108
So I'm flying to D.C.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.110
Is he getting a job?
Is that why you need to talk?

02:34.154 --> 02:35.329
The FBI want him to stay,
make it permanent?

02:35.372 --> 02:37.113
Don't know. We don't know.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.288
Please don't move
to Washington.

02:38.332 --> 02:39.550
I just got used to you,

02:39.594 --> 02:40.899
and you have
so much more to learn.

02:40.943 --> 02:43.337
I love D.C.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.687
Oh, the culture
and the politics,

02:45.730 --> 02:47.341
the people
from all over the world,

02:47.384 --> 02:49.821
the same city that has got
the Supreme Court,

02:49.865 --> 02:52.215
the Museum
of African American History,

02:52.259 --> 02:55.827
Howard University, H.U.!
My alma mater.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.829
It's the best place
on earth.

02:59.091 --> 03:01.093
Don't forget your reading.

03:14.237 --> 03:15.412
I hate it when the judge
leaves town.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.022
I gotta sit around
in holding

03:17.066 --> 03:18.807
instead of basking up here
in the bright light of justice.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.330
The bar exam's next month.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.940
Have you applied
for clerk positions?Not yet.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.377
Have you decided which team
you're joining

03:23.420 --> 03:24.726
prosecution or defense?
- Not yet.

03:24.769 --> 03:27.772
So you have plenty to do.
Now go away.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.557
There you are. Good.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.602
Detective Harris,
what can I do for you?

03:31.646 --> 03:33.604
- You could call me Kevin.
- Eventually, maybe. Not today.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.606
- So listen
- You want to ask me to dinner.

03:35.650 --> 03:38.435
It's been coming for a while.
I've been observing the signs.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.742
Go ahead.I've actually just been
called to a murder

03:40.785 --> 03:43.353
literally 30 seconds ago.
As I'm sure you're aware,

03:43.397 --> 03:45.834
the first 24 hours of murders
are crucial.

03:45.877 --> 03:48.532
I need to focus.
Also, it could jinx the date.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.665
So I should solve
the murder,

03:50.708 --> 03:52.580
and then
I'll come back and...

03:52.623 --> 03:55.017
Okay? I've gotta go.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.627
I still intend to ask you
to...

03:56.671 --> 03:58.063
Understood.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.809
I moved us
out of the neighborhood.

04:04.853 --> 04:07.203
He's in 12th grade.
He got a job.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.336
He just turned 18.
He's a good boy.

04:09.379 --> 04:11.773
He hates it when I say that.

04:11.816 --> 04:13.427
We're talking
about tattoo removal.That's great.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.820
Diego, you talk to Ms. Lopez.

04:15.864 --> 04:17.430
Uh, before you do,
Ms. Fondo,

04:17.474 --> 04:19.389
Maria, you, Diego,
you both need to know

04:19.433 --> 04:21.391
that I am not his lawyer.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.306
Me dijistes que ella
era una abogada.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.656
SÃ­, soy abogada,
pero no del Diego.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.658
El tendrÃ­a que ser...

04:27.702 --> 04:30.095
Diego,
I get assigned my cases

04:30.139 --> 04:31.314
at arraignment, not before.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.794
It's just the way
the system...

04:32.837 --> 04:34.665
The point is that anything
you say to me

04:34.709 --> 04:36.624
is not covered under
attorney-client privilege.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.234
Do you understand?

04:38.278 --> 04:39.801
You didn't tell her?

04:39.844 --> 04:42.325
Tell me what?

04:42.369 --> 04:44.980
The police are looking
for Diego.

04:45.023 --> 04:46.808
They came to the house. I told
'em I didn't know where he was.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.897
He's a suspect?
I thought you said

04:48.940 --> 04:51.029
I thought he had questions.He's innocent.

04:51.073 --> 04:52.248
He was with me
the night of the murder.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.076
- The murder?
- Ms. Lopez, please.

04:54.119 --> 04:56.644
You need to understand
that he had nothing to doStop talking.

04:56.687 --> 04:58.167
The kids from a rival gang,
they shot him,

04:58.210 --> 04:59.908
but Diego wasn't there.Stop talking now.

04:59.951 --> 05:01.649
Diego, listen to me.
Diego.

05:01.692 --> 05:03.477
If the police are showing up
at your house,

05:03.520 --> 05:05.479
they're not going away.

05:05.522 --> 05:06.958
You can be a fugitive
for the rest of your life,

05:07.002 --> 05:08.569
or you can surrender.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.745
That's what I told him,
but he needs a lawyer.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.224
If he surrenders,
he will be assigned a lawyer,

05:12.268 --> 05:14.488
either me or someone else.

05:14.531 --> 05:16.316
It has to be you.
You care, Ms. Lopez.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.143
You don't just see the tattoos.
You see past them.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.320
If you go in, you do not
answer any questions.

05:20.363 --> 05:21.886
You say nothing. Nothing.

05:21.930 --> 05:24.062
Do you understand? Good.

05:24.106 --> 05:27.109
I will try my best to be
there for you tomorrow,

05:27.152 --> 05:29.938
but right now I have to go.
I have to go.

05:29.981 --> 05:31.418
He's innocent, Ms. Lopez.

05:36.510 --> 05:39.382
Sorry I'm late. A car was
literally burning on the 101.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.515
There were flames.Brought you a quinoa quiche

05:41.558 --> 05:42.994
from the vegan place
around the corner.

05:43.038 --> 05:44.735
Thanks.
I've had this quiche.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.781
Not good, huh?Let's go.
We can talk upstairs.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.696
What's going on?
Why'd you want to see me?

05:48.739 --> 05:50.698
- Let's talk upstairs.
- I have to get to work.

05:50.741 --> 05:53.353
You really want
to do this in the lobby?

05:53.396 --> 05:54.441
Okay.

05:54.484 --> 05:57.574
I got some new discovery
last night.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.271
The police recovered a gun
in your father's home.

06:01.230 --> 06:02.274
Ballistics?

06:02.318 --> 06:04.320
Matched.
It's the murder weapon.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.020
What's Vic saying?
He denying it's his?

06:09.064 --> 06:10.544
- That's...privileged.
- Privileged.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.546
Don't leap to any conclusions.
It doesn't mean

06:12.589 --> 06:14.199
Doesn't mean he killed her.

06:14.243 --> 06:15.810
You know how this works.
It's one piece of the puzzle.

06:15.853 --> 06:17.899
And anyway
- I got to, uh...

06:17.942 --> 06:19.335
I'll call you.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.989
Mark.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.383
I think I can get it excluded.
Don't panic.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.304
There's my baby.
There's my baby.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.742
-  Hi, baby!
- Hey.

06:34.785 --> 06:38.180
Ha ha ha! Mmm!

06:40.138 --> 06:42.489
Whoa! Get inside.

06:42.532 --> 06:43.794
It is freezing.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.405
This? This is balmy.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.494
You can take the man
out of California.

06:47.537 --> 06:48.930
You got jokes.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.457
Ooh, I didn't read
a single page.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.154
Sherri is gonna be
so mad at me.

06:56.198 --> 06:57.634
So, this thing tonight...

06:57.678 --> 06:59.462
This drinks thing.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.029
Mm-hmm. They're looking
forward to meeting you.

07:01.072 --> 07:03.466
My temp duty is going well.
People like me, apparently.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.729
Can you please
just cut to the chase?

07:05.773 --> 07:07.601
Deputy Assistant Director

07:07.644 --> 07:09.429
of the Criminal Investigative
Division.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.082
I'm getting an offer.
When?

07:11.126 --> 07:13.302
- Soon.
- Ah!

07:13.345 --> 07:16.523
Congratulations, baby.
I'm so proud of you.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.655
It's your dream job.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.483
I know I was only supposed to be
here for a couple of months.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.746
Wait. How long is theWe won't know
until they make the offer.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.269
but once they do,
I'll pitch working

07:24.313 --> 07:26.184
part-time in L.A.,
part-time in D.C.

07:26.228 --> 07:27.838
Does the FBI
let people do that?

07:27.882 --> 07:29.579
Not usually, but I'm sure
I could swing it.

07:29.623 --> 07:32.016
I can be pretty convincing.
- Yeah, you can.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.454
We're gonna talk about it.
We're gonna think it through.

07:34.497 --> 07:35.672
Nothing's been decided yet,

07:35.716 --> 07:37.805
but right now
I have to go in.

07:37.848 --> 07:40.024
I can't believe
you're going to work.

07:40.068 --> 07:41.983
I'm only here for 16 hours.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.245
I know. I'm sorry.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.986
We're discussing my memo
today.

07:45.029 --> 07:47.510
But I'll be home early,
I promise.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.560
Diego's practically
still a kid,

07:53.603 --> 07:54.909
but he's covered in tats,
face tattoos,

07:54.952 --> 07:56.563
which the cops don't love,
obviously.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.129
Not all gang members
are violent.
I know.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.827
I know boys
who got into gangs

07:59.870 --> 08:03.265
because their father, brother,
cousin were in them, and

08:03.308 --> 08:04.701
And they were expected
to join. I know.

08:04.745 --> 08:06.660
But no one seems
to bother to ask

08:06.703 --> 08:08.662
why these gangs exist
in the first place.

08:08.705 --> 08:10.664
 It just makes me crazy.

08:10.707 --> 08:14.363
I am gonna do everything
I can to help Diego.

08:14.406 --> 08:16.713
I know. I just...
Sensitive subject.

08:16.757 --> 08:19.063
No. I get it. I get it.
I completely get it.

08:19.107 --> 08:20.935
Oh! I bought

08:20.978 --> 08:22.893
I ordered
an espresso machine

08:22.937 --> 08:24.329
for the house.

08:24.373 --> 08:27.332
Oh, okay. Wh-Why?

08:27.376 --> 08:30.553
Because double boiler,
because internal reservoir,

08:30.597 --> 08:32.163
because built-in
burr grinder?

08:32.207 --> 08:34.861
It's a housewarming gift
for us. We deserve it.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.864
- Oh.
- Emily Lopez.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.126
- Thomas.
- Greetings.

08:38.169 --> 08:39.780
This is the P.D.
I told you about.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.303
She's Diego Fondo's lawyer.
Peter Diaz.

08:41.346 --> 08:42.870
He's with
the Hardcore Gang Unit.

08:42.913 --> 08:45.220
Ms. Lopez,
looking forward to it.

08:45.263 --> 08:46.351
Me, too.

08:48.397 --> 08:50.573
Diaz? The D.A.'s bringing out
the big guns.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.575
- Your guns are bigger.

08:52.619 --> 08:55.317
Oh.
There's your boyfriend.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.058
Maria! Wait.
I'll text you.

08:57.101 --> 08:59.103
Okay. Bye. Good luck.

08:59.147 --> 09:00.191
Okay.

09:01.410 --> 09:02.933
Hi. Sorry. I have to

09:02.977 --> 09:05.719
- Hi-bye. It's okay.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.764
Good news. I have been
appointed Diego's lawyer.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.636
Called in a favor.
It's this way.

09:09.679 --> 09:10.550
Come on.
Okay.

09:14.249 --> 09:15.772
The judge we get for trial
will be different.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.165
This one is just
for the arraignment.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.080
I'm gonna enter
a "not guilty" plea.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.560
Maria, it's gonna take
about 15 seconds,

09:20.603 --> 09:21.691
and they're gonna take
Diego back again.

09:21.735 --> 09:22.910
Can I talk to him?

09:22.953 --> 09:24.346
I'm sorry. No.

09:24.389 --> 09:25.956
And you can't wave, either.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.349
Communication of any kind
is a misdemeanor,

09:27.392 --> 09:29.569
and the bailiff
will escort you out, okay?

09:29.612 --> 09:31.745
Is he all right?He's fine.
He's gonna be overwhelmed.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.398
Just seeing you
will make it better,

09:33.442 --> 09:34.922
and we can arrange
a visit later.

09:34.965 --> 09:37.446
Oh, my God.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.622
Oh, come on. Shackles? Really?

09:39.666 --> 09:40.797
I'm just here
to prosecute the case.

09:40.841 --> 09:42.756
Talk to the sheriff.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.845
 Get out there
and take a seat.

09:44.888 --> 09:47.412
Okay. So I'm your lawyer.
You all right?

09:47.456 --> 09:49.023
Okay, we're gonna enter
a "not guilty" plea,

09:49.066 --> 09:50.590
and then we're gonna meet,

09:50.633 --> 09:52.069
and you're gonna tell me
the whole story, okay?

09:52.113 --> 09:54.028
Ms. Lopez!

09:54.071 --> 09:55.159
Amended complaint.

09:55.203 --> 09:55.899
I'm attaching
a gang enhancement

09:55.943 --> 09:57.945
PC 186.22.

09:57.988 --> 09:59.424
- My client has an alibi.
- The alibi's false.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.122
Also, he left the gang. He moved
out of the neighborhood.

10:01.165 --> 10:02.602
He has a part-time job,
a "B"-plus average.

10:02.645 --> 10:03.994
The alibi is false.

10:04.038 --> 10:05.735
I've got video footage
of your client

10:05.779 --> 10:07.955
getting into the same car that
was identified at the scene.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.826
We pinged his cellphone.
He was there.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.611
You'll get all
the evidence shortly,

10:11.654 --> 10:13.656
but I'm sorry, Ms. Lopez.
Your client is guilty of murder.

10:15.789 --> 10:18.313
Calling the matter
of People v. Diego Fondo,

10:18.356 --> 10:20.184
in the charge of murder.

10:20.228 --> 10:23.318
Emily Lopez for the defendant.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.367
Captioned by
Los Angeles Distribution
and Broadcasting, Inc.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.504
Got a minute?

10:35.547 --> 10:37.158
This is my investigator
Carly.
Hey.

10:37.201 --> 10:38.855
- Can we talk?
- Sure. Have a seat.

10:38.899 --> 10:39.987
I'm gonna talk to you
about the gun,

10:40.030 --> 10:41.771
and you're gonna listen.
- Okay.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.294
The police got a warrant
to search Vic's house,

10:43.338 --> 10:45.035
and the probable cause
of that warrant

10:45.079 --> 10:47.037
Why are you dressed
as a biker?

10:47.081 --> 10:48.386
Stakeout at a biker bar?
I smell like beer.

10:48.430 --> 10:51.041
You got a problem with that?
- No.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.260
She likes to stay in character.
Just go with it.

10:52.303 --> 10:54.262
So the warrant
was based on a tip.

10:54.305 --> 10:56.177
Vic had been bragging
at the Shortstop

10:56.220 --> 10:57.700
that he had a gun,
which got them probable cause.

10:57.744 --> 11:00.094
- Which got them the warrant.
- The tip was bad.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.835
Their informant wasn't at
the Shortstop that night.

11:01.878 --> 11:03.227
I talked
to two different people

11:03.271 --> 11:04.707
who said they saw
the dude in Venice

11:04.751 --> 11:06.709
at The Brig,
drunk and under a table.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.624
Tip was bad, Mark.
If I can quash the warrant,

11:08.668 --> 11:10.060
the gun is out.

11:10.104 --> 11:12.410
Okay. Can I go?

11:12.454 --> 11:14.195
- Yeah. Call me later.
- Yeah.

11:14.238 --> 11:18.112
I assume Vic's denying
the gun was his.

11:18.155 --> 11:19.896
Privileged.
- Doesn't matter what Vic says.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.202
I'm gonna get it thrown out.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.204
I'm a prosecutor, Amy.
The gun is evidence.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.248
You're also a son.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.641
Who hates it
when a murder weapon

11:25.685 --> 11:26.860
is thrown out
on a technicality.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.863
Amy, the gun was found
in his house.

11:29.906 --> 11:32.169
- No jury will ever know.
- I will.

11:32.213 --> 11:34.955
Mark, I get that you're
struggling with this,

11:34.998 --> 11:38.480
and I get why,
but stay with me.

11:38.523 --> 11:41.875
Your father is in his 60s
and facing life in prison.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.311
He has no friends.

11:43.354 --> 11:45.661
No one has visited him,
not one person.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.315
All he has is you.

11:47.358 --> 11:48.925
And you.

11:51.101 --> 11:53.321
He's shutting down.
I'm losing him.

11:57.368 --> 12:00.676
- Hey. How's Diego?
- Scared.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.025
You want something to drink?

12:02.069 --> 12:04.201
No booze.
I got iced tea, Cokes?

12:04.245 --> 12:07.161
No. Thank you. Alex, you said
that Diego was with you

12:07.204 --> 12:08.684
the night of the killing.That's right.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.731
Got some pretty compelling
evidence from the prosecutor.

12:11.774 --> 12:13.297
Diego got into a car.
They have that.

12:13.341 --> 12:14.777
There were other guys
in the car,

12:14.821 --> 12:16.213
but they can't be
identified.

12:16.257 --> 12:19.303
But the vehicle can be placed
at the murder scene.

12:19.347 --> 12:20.478
Yeah, well, they must have
dropped 'em off on the way.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.176
They placed Diego
at the murder scene

12:22.219 --> 12:23.873
with his phone.

12:27.572 --> 12:29.139
Alex, why don't you
tell me the truth?

12:29.183 --> 12:30.619
Diego called me in a panic.

12:30.662 --> 12:31.881
I told him to come over.
He did.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.491
And he stayed with you?

12:33.535 --> 12:35.363
Did he say anything
that night?

12:35.406 --> 12:37.365
Next day,
and then I called you.

12:37.408 --> 12:38.975
Alex, what the hell?

12:39.019 --> 12:40.585
Why didn't you tell me?I believed Diego

12:40.629 --> 12:43.023
that he didn't do anything,
but I didn't think

12:43.066 --> 12:44.415
- That I would?
- Anyone would.

12:44.459 --> 12:45.939
The D.A.s office thinks

12:45.982 --> 12:47.767
they know how our communities
work. They don't.

12:47.810 --> 12:50.595
The truth is
Diego got out. He got out.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.423
His mom picked him up
and moved him across town.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.208
They left family,
Maria's sisters,

12:54.251 --> 12:56.036
all the cousins
Diego grew up with.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.646
They're refugees
in their own city.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.082
And they can't go back,

12:59.126 --> 13:00.736
'cause if they do,
he might get targeted

13:00.780 --> 13:01.998
because there's some guys

13:02.042 --> 13:03.304
that don't want you
to get out.

13:03.347 --> 13:04.827
They did everything right,
Ms. Lopez.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.267
He's hardly said a word
to me.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.356
He won't speak. I can't
get his side of the story.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.054
- Diego shuts down.
- I'm his lawyer.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.925
If he won't talk to me,
I can't help him.

13:15.969 --> 13:17.361
I need answers.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.581
He trusts you.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.149
- Sure, I guess.
- Which means I have to.

13:22.192 --> 13:25.326
I need you to go in there
with me and talk to Diego.

13:25.369 --> 13:26.849
But if you do,

13:26.893 --> 13:29.330
it would void
the attorney-client privilege.

13:29.373 --> 13:31.811
So...

13:31.854 --> 13:32.812
I've just hired you.

13:32.855 --> 13:34.639
You're part
of my defense team.

13:34.683 --> 13:36.250
Prosecution always has
a gang expert,

13:36.293 --> 13:38.165
so now you're mine.

13:38.208 --> 13:39.209
You have a tie?

13:39.253 --> 13:41.995
Yeah. Somewhere.

13:44.998 --> 13:46.782
Look at me, Diego.
Come on.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.653
You gotta tell me
what happened, all of it.

13:48.697 --> 13:50.568
She's gonna help you, D.You can trust me

13:50.612 --> 13:52.179
with all of it.

13:52.222 --> 13:53.528
I promise.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.794
Got a call from Rascal.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.622
Said to come to the corner,
so I did.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.276
Who's Rascal?

14:04.017 --> 14:05.627
Real name is Carlos.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.411
He was there,
and Chucky and Delito.

14:07.455 --> 14:08.543
In the car?

14:08.586 --> 14:09.631
He said I had to
come with them.

14:09.674 --> 14:12.025
I didn't want to.

14:12.068 --> 14:13.896
But you don't say no
to these guys,

14:13.940 --> 14:16.594
if they found me,
found my mother.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.248
So we go up
into the hills...

14:18.292 --> 14:20.860
park, and...

14:20.903 --> 14:22.862
they had a guy
in the trunk.

14:24.733 --> 14:25.560
I didn't know.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.042
HeHe was bleeding,

14:29.085 --> 14:30.478
all tied up,
taped up, and...

14:30.521 --> 14:32.654
they put him on the ground,
and he was...

14:35.439 --> 14:36.876
he was crying.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.705
And they had a gun.

14:40.749 --> 14:42.533
And they took turns
shooting him.

14:42.577 --> 14:44.100
They shot him.
They killed him. They...

14:44.144 --> 14:47.321
Did you touch that weapon
at all?

14:47.364 --> 14:49.410
- No, II just stood there.
- Okay.

14:49.453 --> 14:51.368
- I didn't know. I
- It's okay, Diego.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.066
If I didn't go with them,
they would've killed me.

14:53.109 --> 14:55.068
That's how gangs get you
leverage.

14:55.111 --> 14:57.505
They have this over him now.
They'll all say he did it.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.899
The other guys in the car
they're major

14:59.942 --> 15:01.335
Yeah, they're serious guys.

15:01.378 --> 15:05.252
Diego, what you just told me
has value.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.732
The D.A., the cops,
they don't want you.

15:07.776 --> 15:09.734
They want those other guys.

15:09.778 --> 15:13.695
I think I can get you immunity
in exchange for those names,

15:13.738 --> 15:16.524
maybe even a relocation
for you and your mom.

15:16.567 --> 15:20.310
But when this goes to trial,
you'll have to testify.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.573
It's our best chance.

15:24.097 --> 15:25.533
I need you to think about it.

15:33.497 --> 15:35.021
Where have you been?

15:35.064 --> 15:36.761
I've been working.
Been busy.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.285
Amy's keeping me
up to speed.

15:38.328 --> 15:40.330
Oh, you've been busy.
Okay.

15:40.374 --> 15:41.766
People around here
never shut up.

15:41.810 --> 15:44.726
All day long,
yap, yap, yap.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.989
You have any news for me?I'm not gonna talk
about the case.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.252
I can't. I told you why.It was not my gun,
and I did not take

15:49.296 --> 15:51.080
Dad, stop talking. Stop it.

15:51.124 --> 15:53.735
I'm gonna leave in a minute.
You can talk to your lawyer.

15:53.778 --> 15:56.520
I trust her. So should you.
You can keep talking to her.

15:56.564 --> 15:57.565
That's what I came here
to tell you.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.915
And also this.
You lie to yourself.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.223
You always have.
You take these stories,

16:03.266 --> 16:05.747
and you convince yourself
it's the truth.

16:05.790 --> 16:08.228
You rewrite history,
but you can't now.

16:08.271 --> 16:11.405
You need to stop.
You need to be real.

16:11.448 --> 16:14.625
That's why you came here.
You wanted to gloat.

16:14.669 --> 16:17.759
You think I'm guilty.
Of course you do.

16:17.802 --> 16:20.109
You hope that I did it.
You've been waiting for this.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.502
You look down at me

16:21.545 --> 16:23.460
so you can start feeling
better about yourself.

16:23.504 --> 16:26.420
You smug little pieceWe should move on.

16:26.463 --> 16:28.204
You were never there for me,
ever, not ever.

16:28.248 --> 16:30.728
You love this.
You love that I'm here.

16:30.772 --> 16:32.426
It's your dream come true,

16:32.469 --> 16:33.514
but you know
what the truth is?

16:33.557 --> 16:36.256
You're weak.
You've always been weak,

16:36.299 --> 16:39.389
hiding behind your mother,
behind your big job.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.348
Sure, Dad. Hey, this is
a nice place you got.

16:41.391 --> 16:42.697
You decorate it yourself?

16:42.740 --> 16:44.655
God help me,

16:44.699 --> 16:45.787
I'd like to give you
a crack right now.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.658
You'd never get up.
All right, listen.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.008
Why don't you
get him outta here?

16:49.051 --> 16:51.097
Mark?
Huh? Get rid of him!

16:51.140 --> 16:52.446
Come on, Mark, let's go.

16:52.489 --> 16:53.925
All right,
all right, all right!

17:04.109 --> 17:05.198
You okay?

17:05.241 --> 17:07.069
Yeah. Are you?

17:08.723 --> 17:10.550
That's the man
I grew up with.

17:10.594 --> 17:12.640
He's scared.
He's just lashing out.

17:12.683 --> 17:16.035
That's the real Vic.
Now you met him.

17:19.646 --> 17:22.258
If it were up to me,
the gun would stay in.

17:22.301 --> 17:26.609
Because if Vic did it,
then he deserves to pay.

17:33.487 --> 17:34.662
There you are.

17:34.705 --> 17:35.880
So I should warn you,
Lola,

17:35.924 --> 17:37.491
your advance press
is stellar.

17:37.534 --> 17:38.840
Robin talks about you
all the time.

17:38.883 --> 17:41.016
- I do. It's true.
- He'd better.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.236
It sounds like you're making
a real impact on the bench.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.368
Now, I've reading up on some
of your cases, the transcripts.

17:45.412 --> 17:47.022
- Really?
- Well, I was just curious.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.806
I practiced
for four years, so...

17:48.850 --> 17:50.808
But that TV star trial
that was something.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.506
Hayley Halliwell.
It's very sad.

17:52.549 --> 17:53.898
Yeah, and that business
with ICE?

17:53.942 --> 17:56.336
That showed real courage.

17:56.379 --> 17:58.642
Oh! There's Chris Foley.
Uh, Chris!

17:58.686 --> 18:01.167
You gotta meet Foley.
It's a rite of passage.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.386
I'll be right back.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.519
That got on our radar, too.

18:05.562 --> 18:06.911
The ICE thing
that was bold.

18:06.955 --> 18:09.392
And you're with?
- D.O.J.

18:09.436 --> 18:10.480
Special Advisor
to the Principal Deputy

18:10.524 --> 18:11.873
Associate Attorney General.

18:11.916 --> 18:15.137
Oh.
Also an attorney.
I'm on staff.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.444
Something like that happens,
especially...

18:17.487 --> 18:19.924
I think you were
on the job two weeks?Mm, more or less.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.361
People pay attention.

18:21.404 --> 18:23.145
You're on our radar now,
Judge Carmichael.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.669
It's 9:30.
We should get our coats.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.976
Oh. I am so sorry.
I have a flight.

18:28.019 --> 18:30.021
Jeni, it was a pleasure.Such a pleasure.

18:30.065 --> 18:31.675
Good night.

18:31.719 --> 18:34.069
What was that about?
What did he say to you?

18:34.113 --> 18:35.940
I'll tell you outside.

18:35.984 --> 18:38.160
"Chickee" in a Prius,
three minutes.

18:38.204 --> 18:41.163
Okay, talk fast.Okay, so the guy
that I just metChris Foley?

18:41.207 --> 18:43.644
He let it slip.
I'm getting an offer on Monday.

18:43.687 --> 18:44.993
- So it's real?
- It's real.

18:45.036 --> 18:47.474
I'm sorry that we
didn't get more time.

18:47.517 --> 18:48.692
- It's okay.
- II got sucked into

18:48.736 --> 18:50.303
Robin, I get it.
So a one-year assignment,

18:50.346 --> 18:52.174
and how long
to make a decision?

18:52.218 --> 18:53.567
Couple of days,
maybe a week?

18:53.610 --> 18:55.482
And did you ask
about a bicoastal option?

18:55.525 --> 18:57.658
Not yet. It's gonna be
a timing thing.

18:57.701 --> 19:00.269
I gotta get a couple more
people on board

19:00.313 --> 19:02.010
before I do
the official ask.

19:02.053 --> 19:04.317
Well, we'll keep talking,
then decide.

19:04.360 --> 19:07.494
In my head, you were
coming home soon,

19:07.537 --> 19:10.366
and the thought
of all of those flights

19:10.410 --> 19:12.586
and phone calls and Skype,
I just

19:12.629 --> 19:15.241
I have to recalibrate.It's not a done deal yet.

19:15.284 --> 19:16.981
It's an incredible
opportunity.

19:18.374 --> 19:22.596
And there's Chickee.
Okay, text me everything,

19:22.639 --> 19:23.988
all the time.
I will.

19:24.032 --> 19:25.555
I love you.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.166
I love you.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.384
I'm proud of you.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.791
Alex.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.401
What did you tell him? My phone's lighting up.

19:45.445 --> 19:47.751
The cops are making arrests.
They got the other three guys.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.405
- Slow down.
- The guys in the car.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.015
The guys
Diego told us about.

19:51.059 --> 19:52.408
- Wait a second.
- Did you make a deal?

19:52.452 --> 19:54.323
No. No, not yet.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.282
- You told them?
- No, Alex.

19:56.325 --> 19:57.979
Diego's screwed.

19:58.022 --> 19:59.328
We trusted you, and now
he's got nothing, and

19:59.372 --> 20:00.547
Alex, I didn't.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.026
Alex!

20:04.594 --> 20:06.901
What's going on? Em?

20:06.944 --> 20:08.642
What the hell?

20:08.685 --> 20:10.948
The police
are making arrests.

20:10.992 --> 20:13.037
What?
How did they know
who was in that car?

20:13.081 --> 20:14.343
How is that possible?

20:14.387 --> 20:16.215
How the hell did they know?

20:23.744 --> 20:25.485
Hello.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.574
Robin? Are you there?

20:27.617 --> 20:29.489
- Oh, I think I lost you.
- I was just saying that

20:29.532 --> 20:30.968
this is more than a gesture.

20:31.012 --> 20:32.318
This is serious change
that we're talking about.

20:32.361 --> 20:33.580
In the FBI,
maybe 5% of special agents

20:33.623 --> 20:35.321
are African American.

20:35.364 --> 20:37.975
I know that.
I don't need a lecture. I know, I know.

20:38.019 --> 20:40.021
Agents in the C.I.D.
some of them have no idea

20:40.064 --> 20:41.849
about the communities
that they're working in,

20:41.892 --> 20:43.416
what they're listening to,
what they're looking at.

20:43.459 --> 20:45.809
In this job, I can make sure they have the right support,

20:45.853 --> 20:48.159
the right context to really
understand those communities,

20:48.203 --> 20:49.639
work to reset the FBI's relationship

20:49.683 --> 20:50.814
out there in the field.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.251
I'll be working policy,
hiring agents,

20:52.294 --> 20:53.948
mentoring agents. I'll

20:53.991 --> 20:56.255
Can you get the FBI to stop
calling them "inner cities"?

20:56.298 --> 20:58.387
Done. I love you.

20:58.431 --> 21:01.172
No, no, no.
Don't change the subject.

21:01.216 --> 21:02.739
Have you asked them
if you can do some

21:02.783 --> 21:06.439
of this save-the-world stuff
out here in L.A.?

21:06.482 --> 21:08.963
- I'm working on it.
- Baby.

21:09.006 --> 21:10.573
I know that they want me here
on the seventh floor to start.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.096
They said that they were
open to it.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.228
Meaning they said no.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.534
Just to start, and then

21:14.577 --> 21:16.492
We'll keep talking,
I know.

21:16.536 --> 21:20.366
Oh, God. One minute, I think
I can do this, and the next...

21:20.409 --> 21:22.237
- Me, too.
- Plus I'm sleep deprived,

21:22.281 --> 21:24.587
which doesn't help, which I
guess I should get used to.

21:24.631 --> 21:25.980
One year in this job,

21:26.023 --> 21:27.590
then I'm full-time
back in L.A.

21:27.634 --> 21:29.679
I take over the office there.
That's the plan.

21:29.723 --> 21:30.637
Mm-hmm.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.465
Can I say it now?

21:34.075 --> 21:35.424
You can say it.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.600
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

21:39.254 --> 21:40.864
I gotta go.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.606
Call me later.
- Okay.

21:43.650 --> 21:44.825
You can come in.

21:46.479 --> 21:47.871
You're behind.
Your schedule's a mess.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.873
But you can handle it.

21:49.917 --> 21:52.049
You always do.

21:52.093 --> 21:54.269
The police arrested
the other gang members

21:54.313 --> 21:55.705
that were in the car.They got tipped.

21:55.749 --> 21:57.490
Maybe, butyeah, but no.
The timing is too weird,

21:57.533 --> 21:59.143
too close, too...

21:59.187 --> 22:01.972
Those names are all I had
to cut a deal with,

22:02.016 --> 22:04.018
and the D.A. knew that.
- Well, maybe his mom talked.

22:04.061 --> 22:06.107
No way. That doesn't
make any sense.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.065
You don't think...
What?

22:08.109 --> 22:10.938
Do you know if the D.A.
No, they wouldn't, right?

22:10.981 --> 22:12.374
Okay, you're gonna have
to give me a little bit more

22:12.418 --> 22:13.810
to go on.
Forget it.

22:13.854 --> 22:16.683
Maybe you can ask around
back there

22:16.726 --> 22:19.033
ininin Sheriff's land?

22:19.076 --> 22:20.730
Ask what?

22:20.774 --> 22:23.080
If the meeting rooms
at the courthouse are bugged?

22:23.124 --> 22:24.343
Callan.

22:26.301 --> 22:28.956
- I'll see you later.
- What's up, Lopez?

22:28.999 --> 22:30.871
Have you heard anything

22:30.914 --> 22:33.439
about the arrests that were
made on the FDS murder case?

22:33.482 --> 22:35.528
- No, what arrests?
- Last night.

22:35.571 --> 22:38.357
There's something weird.This Peter Diaz' case?

22:38.400 --> 22:39.880
- Uh-huh.
- If he's charging someone,

22:39.923 --> 22:41.969
trust me, he's got a reason.

22:47.975 --> 22:49.585
I'm just saying,
there's no way

22:49.629 --> 22:51.370
the police got this info
from anywhere else.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.023
My client
is the only person

22:53.067 --> 22:54.590
You couldn't possibly
know that.
Just listen.

22:54.634 --> 22:56.113
Why are you talking to me,
Lopez?

22:56.157 --> 22:57.376
So you don't know

22:57.419 --> 22:59.421
if Diaz or the police
interrogated my client

22:59.465 --> 23:01.423
without me, his lawyer,
present?

23:01.467 --> 23:03.382
Lopez. Good. You're here.
I was just gonna call you.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.296
Come on into my office.

23:10.127 --> 23:10.954
Do you remember Peter?

23:10.998 --> 23:12.739
I do.

23:12.782 --> 23:14.480
Yesterday you spoke
to your client Diego Fondo?

23:14.523 --> 23:17.221
Present at that meeting
was Alex Domingues?

23:17.265 --> 23:19.398
That conversation was recorded.
We used the recording

23:19.441 --> 23:21.617
as probable cause
in multiple filings,

23:21.661 --> 23:23.227
and we intend to use it
as evidence.Wait a second.

23:23.271 --> 23:24.925
Paperwork is in process.And we wanted to give you
a heads up

23:24.968 --> 23:27.449
as a courtesy.That conversation
was privileged.

23:27.493 --> 23:28.885
The presence of Mr. Domingues
voided privilege.

23:28.929 --> 23:30.757
Alex Domingues is part
of my defense team.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.759
- If you an objection
- Objection?

23:32.802 --> 23:35.196
Even if the privilege
doesn't extend, which it does,

23:35.239 --> 23:37.416
you put a bug in the courthouse
in a client meeting room?

23:37.459 --> 23:39.679
Where there is no
expectation of privacy.

23:39.722 --> 23:43.117
You are gonna regret this,

23:43.160 --> 23:45.032
both of you.

23:45.075 --> 23:46.599
Make your arguments in court,
Ms. Lopez. We're done here.

23:51.647 --> 23:54.911
Not your monkey, Callan.

23:54.955 --> 23:58.132
Alex Domingues was not
a third party.

23:58.175 --> 24:00.482
Mr. Domingues is an expert
on L.A. gang culture

24:00.526 --> 24:01.962
who was hired to assist me

24:02.005 --> 24:03.267
in the preparation
of Diego's defense.

24:03.311 --> 24:05.182
You hired him.
Did you sign a contract?

24:05.226 --> 24:06.619
We had a verbal agreement.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.272
Your Honor, without any
witnesses to this agreement

24:08.316 --> 24:09.230
He accepted payment.
Obviously, I am aware

24:09.273 --> 24:10.710
of the third party rule,

24:10.753 --> 24:12.189
and I would never
jeopardize my client.

24:12.233 --> 24:13.582
If I thought for one second

24:13.626 --> 24:14.757
that the District Attorney's
office

24:14.801 --> 24:16.759
would put
surveillance equipment

24:16.803 --> 24:18.239
in courthouse
meeting rooms, I

24:18.282 --> 24:19.980
Ms. Lopez, take a breath.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.640
Ms. Kansky.

24:29.163 --> 24:30.251
One moment.

24:34.647 --> 24:36.300
What is happening
in the gallery?

24:36.344 --> 24:37.388
It's the defense bar.

24:37.432 --> 24:39.608
They're lawyers.All of them?

24:39.652 --> 24:41.305
Word has gotten out
the courthouse is bugged.

24:41.349 --> 24:43.220
Trouble is brewing.

24:43.264 --> 24:45.440
Okay. All right.
I got this.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.790
Your Honor, if I may,
I would like to know

24:47.834 --> 24:50.097
how the bug came to be
in the meeting room.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.359
Fair question. Mr. Diaz?

24:51.402 --> 24:52.969
Your Honor, with respect,

24:53.013 --> 24:54.536
the focus of this
emergency hearing

24:54.580 --> 24:55.755
is whether or not
the privilege

24:55.798 --> 24:58.018
I'm all right
with expanding the focus.

24:58.061 --> 24:59.498
Let's talk about the bug.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.238
The room had been employed

25:01.282 --> 25:02.805
in a previous Perkins
operation

25:02.849 --> 25:04.677
in which an undercover
posing as a prisoner

25:04.720 --> 25:05.852
obtained information

25:05.895 --> 25:07.593
from an actual prisoner
in custody.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.029
Standard
law enforcement tool.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.639
So you just accidentally
left the mic on

25:10.683 --> 25:11.988
when I was meeting my client?

25:12.032 --> 25:13.642
People vs. Jordan,1990.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.514
There is no guaranteed right
to privacy

25:15.557 --> 25:16.645
in attorney conference rooms.

25:16.689 --> 25:17.907
In a courthouse?

25:17.951 --> 25:20.475
This is a temple of justice.
It is a church.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.565
Your Honor, the names obtained
in this recording

25:23.609 --> 25:25.132
could have been used
to get my client immunity.

25:25.175 --> 25:26.568
There was no plea deal
being discussed, Your Honor.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.091
Mr. Diaz knew that.

25:28.135 --> 25:30.006
By stealing that leverage
and making those arrests,

25:30.050 --> 25:31.921
he has put my client's life
in mortal danger.

25:31.965 --> 25:34.315
He has been moved
to solitary to protect him.

25:34.358 --> 25:36.099
Stay on point, Ms. Lopez.

25:38.275 --> 25:42.105
Diego Fondo is a soulful,
vulnerable young man

25:42.149 --> 25:44.107
who was trying
to escape gang life.

25:44.151 --> 25:46.066
Your Honor,
this is my field.

25:46.109 --> 25:48.764
Gang members do not talk,
ever.

25:48.808 --> 25:52.115
It is extraordinarily difficult
to get any traction.

25:52.159 --> 25:54.640
These arrests
will save lives.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.163
The means we used
to secure them

25:56.206 --> 25:58.818
were used in the interest
of justice. It's that simple.

25:58.861 --> 26:00.167
Your Honor,
if I could just

26:00.210 --> 26:01.560
I've heard enough.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.736
I'll consider
these arguments carefully.

26:03.779 --> 26:06.347
Court is in recess.

26:14.790 --> 26:15.748
So where were we?

26:15.791 --> 26:16.923
- You solved your murder.
- I did.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.577
Already?

26:18.620 --> 26:20.317
The fact pattern matched
a previous fact pattern

26:20.361 --> 26:21.841
from a cold case
10 years ago.

26:21.884 --> 26:24.495
I have a personal database,
old case files,

26:24.539 --> 26:26.367
articles, studies.
Research is big with me.

26:26.410 --> 26:27.934
I like to be
organized and thorough.

26:27.977 --> 26:31.764
Anyway...
so, Ms. Sherri Kansky,

26:31.807 --> 26:33.592
may I take you to dinner?

26:35.768 --> 26:37.596
I assume you heard
about the bugging.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.989
Only 3 times
in the last 10 minutes.

26:40.033 --> 26:41.687
Everyone is talking about it.

26:41.730 --> 26:43.253
Not sure why no one's
talking about the victim,

26:43.297 --> 26:44.777
but anywayWhat is your opinion?

26:44.820 --> 26:46.779
Of the bugging?
Is this a test?

26:46.822 --> 26:48.345
If I get it right,
you'll go out with me?

26:48.389 --> 26:49.738
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

26:49.782 --> 26:51.958
Well, interesting.

26:52.001 --> 26:54.395
I'm a cop. I'm in favor.

26:54.438 --> 26:56.658
If I said anything
other than Perkins ops

26:56.702 --> 26:58.617
are an indispensable tool,
you'd know I'm lying.

26:58.660 --> 27:01.184
They're legal. A little
unusual to use in here,

27:01.228 --> 27:02.490
and I wouldn't do it myself,
but...

27:02.533 --> 27:03.665
But?

27:03.709 --> 27:04.971
Legal.

27:05.014 --> 27:06.973
Mm. Is that
your final answer?

27:07.016 --> 27:08.278
Final answer.

27:09.932 --> 27:11.194
I'll think about it.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.026
If I were you,

27:17.070 --> 27:19.550
I would look
at how Jordan,1972,

27:19.594 --> 27:22.162
addressing prisoner-attorney
communication,

27:22.205 --> 27:25.121
is frankly trumped
by People v. Jordan,

27:25.165 --> 27:26.949
no relation, 1990,

27:26.993 --> 27:28.777
regarding permissive monitoring
of conference rooms.

27:28.821 --> 27:30.953
You need to ponder
at length.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.128
Whoop.
I have a hearing.

27:32.172 --> 27:33.390
Oh, good. I mean...

27:33.434 --> 27:35.001
Walk with me.Really? Okay.

27:35.044 --> 27:36.306
Two more crucial points.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.004
You wouldn't be trying

27:38.047 --> 27:39.658
to influence my decision,
would you?

27:39.701 --> 27:40.963
- I would not.
- Infect me

27:41.007 --> 27:44.314
with your old, conservative,
white guy rationale.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.055
Well, such as it is?
Hey, look,

27:46.099 --> 27:47.622
you want to exclude
the recording,

27:47.666 --> 27:50.277
alienate all of
L.A. County law enforcement,

27:50.320 --> 27:52.235
set the course of justice
back 25 years,

27:52.279 --> 27:54.063
that is your business.

27:54.107 --> 27:57.676
But you are a referee here,
and there are rules.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.590
Carmichael!

28:03.725 --> 28:04.726
Judge Benner.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.554
How is it that, once again,

28:06.597 --> 28:08.034
the entire courthouse

28:08.077 --> 28:10.079
is talking about your case?
You have a talent.

28:10.123 --> 28:11.472
Robin's about to get
an offer.

28:11.515 --> 28:13.474
A job offer in D.C.?
Is he going to take it?

28:13.517 --> 28:15.650
I can't think about that
right now.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.652
Because you have a small,
little prisoners' rights-

28:17.696 --> 28:20.394
attorney-client-privilege
gang-murder question

28:20.437 --> 28:21.961
you need to think about
instead.

28:22.004 --> 28:23.223
It's a slow day.

28:23.266 --> 28:25.660
The privilege piece
is almost straightforward.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.270
Third party voids
privilege,

28:27.314 --> 28:30.534
but is a gang expert
a member of the defense team

28:30.578 --> 28:32.972
or a witness you call
to the stand?

28:33.015 --> 28:34.495
Then there's
the sticky piece.

28:34.538 --> 28:36.105
Sixth Amendment questions.

28:36.149 --> 28:38.020
Surveillance creep.
It's everywhere.

28:38.064 --> 28:39.369
Suddenly people are free
to parachute

28:39.413 --> 28:41.023
into other people's lives

28:41.067 --> 28:43.286
and watch and listen
anywhere.

28:43.330 --> 28:46.855
Robin's colleagues knew a lot
about me, my decisions.

28:46.899 --> 28:49.423
They're not bugging
your chambers, Carmichael.

28:49.466 --> 28:52.513
Yet. There was an open mic
in a meeting room

28:52.556 --> 28:54.645
in this courthouse
used for lawyers.

28:54.689 --> 28:57.344
I'm sure as a prosecutor,
you've used

28:57.387 --> 28:59.563
I obtained Perkins warrants
for prisons

28:59.607 --> 29:02.218
and placed undercover
informants in cells

29:02.262 --> 29:04.220
that we then bugged
to get information,

29:04.264 --> 29:07.093
but never in the courthouse
and not like this.

29:07.136 --> 29:09.965
If it were up to meAre you really gonna finish
that sentence, Lisa?

29:10.009 --> 29:13.490
The question is, how do I
finish that sentence?

29:13.534 --> 29:16.842
Well, you don't have
to rewrite the Constitution.

29:16.885 --> 29:17.886
Not today.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.373
I found the mic.
What? When?

29:26.416 --> 29:28.810
After we talked. I went all
Jason Bourne on the room.

29:28.854 --> 29:29.942
Did you rip it out
and throw it in the garbage?

29:29.985 --> 29:31.900
- Uh, no.
- Did you yell into it

29:31.944 --> 29:33.815
and tell whoever was listening
where they could put their

29:33.859 --> 29:36.339
Seriously, Luke,
you don't actually think

29:36.383 --> 29:37.950
that should be allowed toThe law's pretty clear.

29:37.993 --> 29:40.561
Oh, actually, it's not.
It's not a Perkins.

29:40.604 --> 29:43.042
A Perkins is targeted.There's precedent.

29:43.085 --> 29:44.739
Luke, you're gonna be
a lawyer.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.785
This isn't just
a theoretical argument.

29:46.828 --> 29:47.786
You're gonna have toWe don't have to
talk about it.

29:47.829 --> 29:49.135
- Yeah, we do.
- Yeah, you do.

29:49.178 --> 29:52.181
Let me know how it ends.

29:52.225 --> 29:56.751
I'm like this weird bailiff-
almost lawyer hybrid species,

29:56.795 --> 29:58.318
foot in both worlds.

29:58.361 --> 30:00.711
That's a copout.
What do you actually believe?

30:00.755 --> 30:02.975
- That is a trick question.
- Another copout.

30:03.018 --> 30:04.715
Why, because I'm not exactly
sure how I feel about something,

30:04.759 --> 30:06.195
or because I might not
agree with you?

30:06.239 --> 30:08.023
I'm not
a defense attorney, Em.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.720
I don't have to convince myself
of things the way you do.

30:12.854 --> 30:13.855
Wow.

30:13.899 --> 30:15.335
That'sThat's not
what I meant.

30:15.378 --> 30:16.989
No.

30:17.032 --> 30:18.381
I have to go.

30:19.774 --> 30:22.516
We're not kissing in public
right now, right?

30:22.559 --> 30:23.865
So I'm not making
a statement.

30:23.909 --> 30:26.868
I'm just...walking away.

30:36.922 --> 30:39.359
Hmm, let me guess.
Fashion shoot?

30:39.402 --> 30:41.578
Clubbing, West Hollywood.
I'm gonna get drunk.

30:41.622 --> 30:43.711
It's Carly's process.
Just go with it.

30:43.754 --> 30:45.104
Mark, your father was framed.

30:45.147 --> 30:46.801
What?

30:46.845 --> 30:48.324
Carly's been busy. Tell him.

30:48.368 --> 30:51.327
So the Armenians, they wanted
Addison Farwell dead.

30:51.371 --> 30:52.851
- She was ripping them off.
- She was running

30:52.894 --> 30:54.591
one of their card games,
and while her clients,

30:54.635 --> 30:57.159
which were their clients,
were playing poker all night,

30:57.203 --> 30:59.031
oh, my God, her guys were
literally robbing them blind

30:59.074 --> 31:00.815
their houses, I mean.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.861
It's pretty ballsy, right?And when the Armenians
found out,

31:02.904 --> 31:05.254
Addison had to go.Meanwhile, Vic Callan's

31:05.298 --> 31:06.865
running his own little game
on their turf,

31:06.908 --> 31:08.605
which is a big no-no.

31:08.649 --> 31:10.390
So they kill Addison
and frame Vic.

31:10.433 --> 31:11.870
Two birds, one stone.

31:11.913 --> 31:13.219
The argument he had
with Addison?Motive.

31:13.262 --> 31:15.482
- The bragging about the gun?
- Probable cause.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.571
The murder weapon
in Vic's house.Planted.

31:17.614 --> 31:19.051
And it worked.
The cops bit down hard.

31:19.094 --> 31:21.357
He was framed, Mark.
Two birds, one stone.

31:21.401 --> 31:22.619
That's my defense.

31:22.663 --> 31:24.404
- And you can prove this?
- Maybe.

31:24.447 --> 31:26.928
Probably.
Motion to traverse tomorrow.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.451
You should come.

31:28.495 --> 31:30.758
Let's go. You need to party.

31:30.801 --> 31:31.585
Yeah.

31:35.023 --> 31:37.199
It comes down to this.
Your father has a temper.

31:37.243 --> 31:39.941
He is a piece of work
for sure.

31:39.985 --> 31:41.464
But is he capable
of murder?

31:41.508 --> 31:43.249
Do you really believe that,
Mark?

31:45.468 --> 31:46.513
I have a motion
to prepare.

32:00.962 --> 32:03.051
And the worst part is everyone
has an opinion.

32:03.095 --> 32:05.227
They all think they know
how I'm gonna rule.

32:05.271 --> 32:07.447
I'm the creative judge,
the defense-friendly,

32:07.490 --> 32:09.710
anti-law enforcementHow areyou gonna rule?

32:09.753 --> 32:12.452
If I knew,
I wouldn't tell you.

32:12.495 --> 32:15.411
I know kids like Diego,
that neighborhood

32:15.455 --> 32:16.847
single parent, no money

32:16.891 --> 32:19.328
they have to make a choice
way too early

32:19.372 --> 32:20.939
how they're gonna survive,

32:20.982 --> 32:24.986
and when they come here
to this building,

32:25.030 --> 32:27.293
the deck is already stacked
against them everywhere else.

32:27.336 --> 32:29.164
It can't be here.
- And yet?

32:29.208 --> 32:31.036
And yet yes, exactly.

32:31.079 --> 32:33.038
These gangs.

32:33.081 --> 32:34.822
If we are going
to deal with them,

32:34.865 --> 32:36.302
we have to be bold.

32:36.345 --> 32:39.261
No snitching means
we need tools.

32:39.305 --> 32:41.307
- Can I give you some advice?
- Can I stop you?

32:41.350 --> 32:43.744
Forget what people
expect of you.

32:43.787 --> 32:45.876
Forget how people think
Lola Carmichael should

32:45.920 --> 32:47.835
look at a problem.
Focus on the law.

32:47.878 --> 32:49.358
Focus on the arguments.

32:49.402 --> 32:50.881
I'm gonna focus
on the accused,

32:50.925 --> 32:52.361
who sit in these rooms

32:52.405 --> 32:54.320
and talk to their lawyers
in good faith,

32:54.363 --> 32:55.669
and I'm gonna focus
on the communities

32:55.712 --> 32:57.236
being victimized,
and actually,

32:57.279 --> 32:59.412
I'm gonna focus
on the victim.

32:59.455 --> 33:01.066
A young man was killed.

33:01.109 --> 33:03.546
Okay. All right.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.374
Changing the subject,

33:05.418 --> 33:08.334
I've been thinking
about you and Vic.
And?

33:08.377 --> 33:10.597
I think you're missing
the entire point.
Really?

33:10.640 --> 33:12.686
I don't think
it's about the murder.

33:12.729 --> 33:15.471
Not for you. I think
you are putting Vic on trial

33:15.515 --> 33:17.604
for your entire
crappy childhood,

33:17.647 --> 33:20.346
and guess what.
He is never, ever, ever

33:20.389 --> 33:23.001
not going to be guilty.

33:26.091 --> 33:27.048
How long have you been
holding that one back?

33:27.092 --> 33:29.659
Ooh, too long.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.922
Better late than never.

33:31.966 --> 33:34.534
You should be thinking
about your case,

33:34.577 --> 33:35.796
not me and Vic.

33:37.928 --> 33:39.408
I can do both.

33:46.241 --> 33:47.895
Ohh, Sherri, what is it?

33:49.766 --> 33:51.159
Hey, Your Honor,
you got a minute?

33:51.203 --> 33:53.596
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

33:55.946 --> 33:58.079
Uh, Your Honor,
I know you can't

33:58.123 --> 34:01.430
This is nothing ex parte.
I just want to...

34:01.474 --> 34:04.085
I need to say something.

34:04.129 --> 34:07.001
Okay, so, um,
where I grew up,

34:07.045 --> 34:08.481
the neighborhood, Lynwood,

34:08.524 --> 34:11.831
it was full
of hardworking people

34:11.875 --> 34:15.444
families. It was amazing.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.098
But there were gangs there,
too.

34:17.141 --> 34:19.318
- Sara.
- Just part of the fabric of...

34:19.360 --> 34:22.321
But not everyone is
a gang member,

34:22.364 --> 34:24.714
and not all gangs...

34:24.757 --> 34:27.065
gang members
are criminal.

34:27.108 --> 34:28.588
They run businesses.

34:28.630 --> 34:30.677
They raise
incredible families.

34:30.719 --> 34:32.940
They contribute
to the community.

34:32.983 --> 34:35.290
They just need a place
to belong, that's it.

34:35.333 --> 34:36.900
But they all get targeted.

34:36.944 --> 34:38.250
Sara, I need you to stop.

34:38.293 --> 34:39.686
People use them.

34:39.728 --> 34:42.428
They use these
these boys, these men,

34:42.471 --> 34:44.038
some of whom
are my family.

34:44.081 --> 34:46.909
They are used by

34:46.954 --> 34:50.958
as a political platform
to get sheriffs elected,

34:51.001 --> 34:55.136
to get D.A.s elected,
to raise funds for police

34:55.179 --> 34:57.443
rather than
for social services.

34:57.486 --> 34:59.314
Now, I know it's hard
to get the truth out.

34:59.358 --> 35:03.753
There is so much noise.

35:03.797 --> 35:06.582
But in this building...

35:06.626 --> 35:10.238
in 802,
you have inspired us all

35:10.282 --> 35:11.979
by leveling
the playing field.

35:12.022 --> 35:14.547
Now they are trying
to change that

35:14.590 --> 35:15.852
by putting microphones
into our

35:15.896 --> 35:18.551
I have to stop you now.

35:22.729 --> 35:24.339
But I hear you.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.305
Thank you, Your Honor.

35:39.789 --> 35:42.618
Detective, when you obtained
your bogus warrant

35:42.662 --> 35:44.403
to search my client's house
- Objection. Argumentative.

35:44.446 --> 35:46.100
No, it isn't. Overruled.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.276
The sole basis for your warrant
was a statement

35:48.320 --> 35:49.973
made by your informant
Mr. Torley

35:50.017 --> 35:52.889
that on December 3rd
at 9 p.m.,

35:52.933 --> 35:54.587
at the Shortstop bar
in Echo Park,

35:54.630 --> 35:56.415
he overheard my client brag

35:56.458 --> 35:58.330
about having a .357 Magnum
at his house,

35:58.373 --> 36:01.289
which he'd use to, quote,
take care of business.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.725
Correct, and I would add

36:02.769 --> 36:04.162
that the defendant
was known to police.

36:04.205 --> 36:06.251
For playing cards,
not murder.

36:06.294 --> 36:07.817
So, Detective,

36:07.861 --> 36:10.211
you had no idea
the informant was lying?

36:10.255 --> 36:12.300
- Objection.
- Overruled. Sit down.

36:12.344 --> 36:13.736
Look, we took the statement
in good faith.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.303
In good faith, of course.

36:15.347 --> 36:17.784
So you were unaware that,
on the night in question,

36:17.827 --> 36:20.047
your informant was nowhere
near the Shortstop.

36:20.090 --> 36:21.831
He was lying in a puddle
of his own vomit

36:21.875 --> 36:23.006
on Abbot Kinney.

36:23.050 --> 36:24.443
Your Honor,
even if this were true,

36:24.486 --> 36:25.922
the "good faith"
exception applies.

36:25.966 --> 36:27.054
Actually,
it doesn't, Your Honor.

36:27.097 --> 36:28.882
I'm gonna establish why.

36:28.925 --> 36:31.189
- Sit down, Mr. Koch.
- Detective,

36:31.232 --> 36:33.147
at any point,
did you run Mr. Torley

36:33.191 --> 36:34.844
through your own system?

36:34.888 --> 36:38.196
No.
So you didn't see
an L.A.P.D. 647 citation

36:38.239 --> 36:40.763
for public intoxication
in Venice,

36:40.807 --> 36:43.157
16 miles
from the Shortstop.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.072
- No, I did not.
- Nothing further, Your Honor.

36:45.115 --> 36:46.856
Mr. Koch, rebuttal?

36:46.900 --> 36:49.816
IAhem.
No, Your Honor, I'm good.

36:49.859 --> 36:52.079
I've heard enough.
The witness may step down.

36:52.122 --> 36:53.863
The gun is excluded.

36:53.907 --> 36:56.301
If I were you, I'd start
thinking about a deal.

36:56.344 --> 36:58.216
All rise.

37:12.665 --> 37:14.754
I hit the red line
the other day.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.059
Apologies.

37:16.103 --> 37:18.148
Yeah. Me, too.

37:18.192 --> 37:21.064
I don't like the way
you've lived your life

37:21.108 --> 37:22.936
or the things
you've done.

37:22.979 --> 37:26.069
You don't like mine
for whatever reason.

37:26.113 --> 37:27.375
We could trade punches
on that

37:27.419 --> 37:29.943
for the next 10 years.
Probably will.

37:29.986 --> 37:33.207
But I don't think
you're a murderer, Dad.

37:54.707 --> 37:57.449
Courthouse meeting rooms
should not be bugged.

37:57.492 --> 38:00.495
For the record, I want to state
clearly and without ambiguity,

38:00.539 --> 38:02.280
I personally believe

38:02.323 --> 38:05.152
defendants' Sixth Amendment
rights should apply.

38:05.195 --> 38:06.414
This is a courthouse,
not a prison.

38:06.458 --> 38:08.373
It isspecial.

38:08.416 --> 38:11.332
I find the defense's argument
that Mr. Domingues' presence

38:11.376 --> 38:13.334
did not void
attorney-client privilege

38:13.378 --> 38:14.683
to be compelling.

38:14.727 --> 38:17.469
However, I am not convinced

38:17.512 --> 38:20.341
that Mr. Domingues was
a part of the defense team.

38:20.385 --> 38:23.997
An ex-gang member hired
as an expert at the 11th hour

38:24.040 --> 38:25.912
to preserve privilege,
while creative,

38:25.955 --> 38:29.307
does not meet the standards
established by precedent.

38:29.350 --> 38:32.092
Further, the circumstances
by which this evidence,

38:32.135 --> 38:34.050
these names, were obtained

38:34.094 --> 38:37.010
does not invalidate
its probative value.

38:37.053 --> 38:40.753
Law enforcement must be given
the leeway to do its job,

38:40.796 --> 38:44.104
to seek justice
on behalf of the victim,

38:44.147 --> 38:48.195
a young man whose life
was violently taken away

38:48.238 --> 38:49.414
Lucas Montez.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.331
The motion is denied.
The recordings are in.

38:53.374 --> 38:54.593
Your Honor

38:54.636 --> 38:56.551
And right on cue,
save it, Ms. Lopez.

38:56.595 --> 38:59.641
Both of you, my chambers.

38:59.685 --> 39:01.339
Your Honor, if I may...

39:01.382 --> 39:03.210
You deal with terrible
crimes, Mr. Diaz,

39:03.253 --> 39:05.386
and I value your work,
but if I may,

39:05.430 --> 39:07.519
Diego Fondo may have been
present for the murder,

39:07.562 --> 39:09.216
but that does mean
he took part.

39:09.259 --> 39:11.392
- Of course, but
- Those facts will undoubtedly

39:11.436 --> 39:14.569
be discovered at trial
unless your case

39:14.613 --> 39:16.136
against the other members
of the gang

39:16.179 --> 39:17.616
will be a lot stronger

39:17.659 --> 39:18.921
if you believe Diego
is telling the truth

39:18.965 --> 39:20.401
and you can get him
to testify.

39:20.445 --> 39:22.838
In exchange for immunity
and no jail time.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.710
And relocation
for him and his mother.

39:24.753 --> 39:26.538
They start again
somewhere else.

39:26.581 --> 39:27.626
Otherwise, FDS will

39:27.669 --> 39:29.454
So Diego is prepared
to testify?

39:29.497 --> 39:31.630
I believe so, Your Honor.
He's ready to tell the truth.

39:31.673 --> 39:33.153
You know, he made a mistake,

39:33.196 --> 39:35.155
but he had the strength
and the courage to fix it.

39:35.198 --> 39:37.244
He came to me,
to us, for help.

39:37.287 --> 39:39.855
He is the reason
we all do this.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.121
When you're ready,
I'll see you back here

39:45.165 --> 39:47.994
for the terms of the deal.
You're excused.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.219
- That went well.
- Did it?

39:56.263 --> 39:57.960
When a person
is incarcerated,

39:58.004 --> 39:59.962
these are the only spaces

40:00.006 --> 40:00.963
they can talk
to their lawyers.

40:01.007 --> 40:02.965
I just made them
less safe.

40:03.009 --> 40:05.315
Am I gonna regret this?

40:11.321 --> 40:12.584
There you are.

40:12.627 --> 40:14.542
Forgot my...

40:14.586 --> 40:16.109
How'd that go?

40:16.152 --> 40:18.459
Plea deal.
Witness protection.

40:18.503 --> 40:19.852
That's great.

40:19.895 --> 40:22.420
Yeah, but the recording
stays in.

40:22.463 --> 40:24.509
She's allowing it.
I can't believe it.

40:24.552 --> 40:26.815
It's so...wrong.

40:26.859 --> 40:28.295
I checked the room again.
The bug's gone.

40:28.338 --> 40:29.992
They took it out.

40:30.036 --> 40:31.820
Maybe, or they just
hid it better.

40:31.864 --> 40:33.431
Listen, I'm sorry
about what I said.It's okay.

40:33.474 --> 40:35.868
We were just arguing, right?
That's what we do. We like it.

40:35.911 --> 40:37.086
On this, we're just
getting started.

40:37.130 --> 40:39.132
Should I come by later
or...

40:39.175 --> 40:41.003
You know what? I'm tired.
I think I'll just...

40:41.047 --> 40:44.616
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay. See you tomorrow.

40:55.322 --> 40:56.758
Night Market Song.

40:58.673 --> 41:03.025
Green curry duck,
larb gai, sticky rice.

41:03.069 --> 41:05.680
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:05.724 --> 41:07.769
No quinoa in sight.

41:07.813 --> 41:10.511
So...you're a prosecutor.

41:10.555 --> 41:12.600
What kind of plea deal
would you offer?

41:18.084 --> 41:20.086
I accept, if only
to convince you

41:20.129 --> 41:21.348
you are misguided.

41:21.391 --> 41:24.482
I have a set of boundaries
and guidelines

41:24.525 --> 41:26.614
that we should go over.I'll just ignore them.

41:26.658 --> 41:28.050
You should prepare
to be surprised.

41:28.094 --> 41:29.269
I hate surprises.

41:29.312 --> 41:31.097
I'm willing to bet
all of the money I've got

41:31.140 --> 41:32.838
that you don't.

41:40.367 --> 41:41.847
It could be anywhere.

41:41.890 --> 41:43.326
No guarantees
it's California, even,

41:43.370 --> 41:45.851
and you can't contact
anyone, not even family.

41:45.894 --> 41:46.895
I know it's a lot.

41:46.939 --> 41:48.897
No, it's okay.

41:48.941 --> 41:50.899
It's wonderful.

41:50.943 --> 41:52.858
You saved his life,
Ms. Lopez.

41:52.901 --> 41:54.947
I'm so grateful.

41:54.990 --> 41:57.253
Thank you, Ms. Lopez.

41:57.297 --> 41:59.473
You're welcome.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.954
Don't think, uh...

42:01.997 --> 42:04.086
I know I've hurt you,
Mama,

42:04.130 --> 42:06.524
and I know what
you've done for me,

42:06.567 --> 42:08.743
what you've given up.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.839
Okay. I'm in.

42:17.883 --> 42:19.319
Take the damn job.

42:19.362 --> 42:20.494
Yeah?

42:20.538 --> 42:23.541
That passion, that drive you have

42:23.584 --> 42:25.107
to make the world better
I fell in love with that

42:25.151 --> 42:26.718
and with you.

42:26.761 --> 42:28.589
You need to be who you are
and do what you do.

42:28.633 --> 42:29.590
We'll make it work, Lo.

42:29.634 --> 42:31.592
And somehow,
we'll make it work.

42:31.636 --> 42:33.463
And look, if it gets
too much for either of us,

42:33.507 --> 42:35.901
I'll transfer back to L.A.
or I'll quit the Bureau.

42:35.944 --> 42:38.730
You are not leaving
the Bureau. If I have to.

42:38.773 --> 42:41.776
This work is important,
but, Lo, youyou are my love,

42:41.820 --> 42:43.909
and L.A. is our home.

42:43.952 --> 42:46.825
We are lucky. There are
only miles between us.

42:46.868 --> 42:48.522
- Could be a lot worse.
- And we have

42:48.566 --> 42:50.611
red eye quickies
and weekend pillow talk

42:50.655 --> 42:51.830
to look forward to.

42:51.873 --> 42:53.440
Oh, I like the sound
of that.

42:53.483 --> 42:54.746
We can meet in the middle.

42:54.789 --> 42:56.878
Kansas is a sexy state.

42:56.922 --> 42:58.227
It is?

42:58.271 --> 42:59.533
It will be
when we're there.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.056
I'm booking flights right now.

43:01.100 --> 43:02.797
Mm-hmm. And bubble baths.
