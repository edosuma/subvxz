Where is Bill supposed to live now?

12:03.325 --> 12:05.657
HANK: Mr. Chairman,
l'd like to respectfully suggest...

12:05.761 --> 12:09.595
that you put an asterisk next to
Ricky Suggs' name in the record book.

12:09.865 --> 12:12.095
And that asterisk should read:

12:12.201 --> 12:15.364
''This record was attained
by means of fraud...

12:15.471 --> 12:17.166
''and bad sportsmanship.''

12:17.306 --> 12:18.500
Thank you.

12:21.543 --> 12:23.773
That suggestion is denied, Mr. Hill.

12:24.012 --> 12:26.742
Ricky Suggs is an inspiration to us all.

12:27.316 --> 12:29.045
Now, on to more important matters,

12:29.151 --> 12:32.052
My motion to add
''fatty-fatty-boom-ballatty''...

12:32.154 --> 12:34.452
to the list of unacceptable hate speech.

12:38.193 --> 12:42.186
[Sentimental instrumental music]

12:51.807 --> 12:54.298
HANK: Remember when we used to
run wind sprints out here...

12:54.409 --> 12:56.468
till we couldn't stop throwing up?

12:56.578 --> 12:57.636
[Bill mumbling in agreement]

12:57.746 --> 12:59.714
BlLL: When we were kings, Hank.

13:00.415 --> 13:02.474
HANK: You okay?
BlLL: Sure.

13:02.885 --> 13:05.752
Good sport doesn't whine
when things don't go his way.

13:05.854 --> 13:08.618
Yeah, but good sports play by the rules.

13:09.124 --> 13:10.785
You did. They didn't.

13:11.927 --> 13:14.589
HANK: How about that time
we snuck into the stadium...

13:14.696 --> 13:17.927
and mowed the whole field
before the groundskeeper could?

13:18.467 --> 13:19.661
[Hank laughs]

13:19.968 --> 13:23.028
The look on his face
right before we apologized.

13:23.839 --> 13:26.433
Yeah. We were crazy.

13:27.176 --> 13:29.736
l can thank the Army
for straightening me out.

13:29.845 --> 13:32.780
Yeah. You were a changed man
when you came back.

13:33.148 --> 13:35.776
Oh, yeah.
l may not have made it to Vietnam...

13:35.884 --> 13:39.012
since the war ended
right after l volunteered.

13:39.121 --> 13:41.487
But barber school at Fort Bragg...

13:42.024 --> 13:44.652
baptism by fire, my friend.

13:45.527 --> 13:49.156
HANK: lt's too bad you had to ship out
before the end of our last season.

13:49.498 --> 13:53.025
BlLL: The country needed barbers
and l was flunking trigonometry.

13:54.937 --> 13:56.996
You weren't around at graduation.

13:57.206 --> 13:58.833
Or senior prom.

14:03.045 --> 14:04.672
Was there dancing?

14:06.882 --> 14:10.579
Coach, what happens if a player
gets injured or can't finish his season?

14:10.686 --> 14:14.122
We red-shirt him and then let him
make up the games the next season.

14:14.223 --> 14:17.750
-What if he's out for a couple seasons?
-As long as he hasn't graduated...

14:17.859 --> 14:20.384
he keeps his eligibility
and plays the next season.

14:20.495 --> 14:23.293
What if he's out for 25 seasons?

14:23.398 --> 14:25.195
Oh, Hank, find a pick-up game.

14:25.300 --> 14:29.737
l am talking about
William Fontaine Delatur Dauterive.

14:31.039 --> 14:34.440
The Billdozer.
He still has red-shirt eligibility.

14:34.543 --> 14:38.035
HANK: He didn't finish his senior season
and you can put him in Friday's game.

14:38.146 --> 14:40.910
You're asking me to slice
another piece of phony-baloney...

14:41.016 --> 14:42.608
like they made me at last week's game?

14:42.718 --> 14:46.779
No, l'm not asking you to fix the game.
l'm asking you to fix an injustice.

14:46.888 --> 14:50.483
Just put Bill in and let him
get his record back fair and square.

14:50.592 --> 14:53.322
Let's show those kids
how we used to play football.

14:53.428 --> 14:55.328
l'd have to cut somebody.

14:56.732 --> 14:59.860
You got that exchange student
who kicks barefoot.

15:00.302 --> 15:02.099
l think we've all had enough of that.

15:02.671 --> 15:04.263
l can play again?

15:04.373 --> 15:07.274
Thank God l never graduated
from high school.

15:08.010 --> 15:09.773
Do l have to go to class, too?

15:09.878 --> 15:12.073
Come on, Bill, you're on the football team.

l'm not sure how l feel about
the other team just rolling over for me.

15:52.354 --> 15:53.787
Don't you worry about that.

15:53.889 --> 15:56.949
Belton has the toughest
defensive line in the division.

15:57.092 --> 15:59.822
You know the whole first string
flunked history last year...

15:59.928 --> 16:02.294
so they could come back and go to State?

16:02.664 --> 16:04.325
They'll never roll over.

16:06.234 --> 16:07.201
Good.

16:08.136 --> 16:12.596
HANK: Bobby, success on the field
depends on hard work off the field.

16:12.908 --> 16:15.968
That's why l run a tough practice,
but a fun practice.

16:16.411 --> 16:17.639
