00:09.877 --> 00:12.213
* Tell me where you've seen
my life *

00:12.246 --> 00:16.050
* I look in your eyes
and can only see my... *

00:16.084 --> 00:18.119
(alarm blaring)

00:20.254 --> 00:22.256
(key pads beeping)

00:22.290 --> 00:24.792
(beeping)

00:24.825 --> 00:26.060
(alarm stops)

00:26.094 --> 00:28.162
(beeping)

00:41.475 --> 00:43.744
(beeping)

00:43.777 --> 00:46.214
(whooshing)

00:52.253 --> 00:54.288
(alarm blaring)

00:54.322 --> 00:56.224
* Tell me where you've seen
my life *

00:56.257 --> 00:57.558
* You're biting my hands

00:57.591 --> 01:00.594
* And knocking me down
to the ground *

01:00.628 --> 01:02.062
(keypads beeping)

01:03.564 --> 01:04.598
(alarm stops)

01:04.632 --> 01:06.400
DISPATCHER: Base to Nora-fifty,
we have an alert.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.436
Come on, Johnny, this is
the third time tonight

01:08.469 --> 01:09.570
the alarm has gone off.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.105
Every time the cop's respond,

01:11.139 --> 01:13.174
it's a $500 charge.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.408
The place is secure.

01:14.442 --> 01:18.212
Now, just send someone over
to fix the damn thing already.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.754
(saw buzzing)

01:32.726 --> 01:34.695
DAVID: Dude, what were you
doing out there?

01:34.728 --> 01:36.564
Interviewing a suspect.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.366
What'd it look like?

01:38.399 --> 01:40.234
Like you were late
for a date or something, huh?

01:40.268 --> 01:41.869
Oh, come on now. You're the one
who interrupted me.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.637
What, you didn't
want me to do that?

01:43.671 --> 01:45.606
You gave me the
sign to back off.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.608
I thought you had something
in your eye, man.

01:47.641 --> 01:48.676
The sign to back
off is that.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.644
Hey, ladies, the sorority
meeting is right there

01:50.678 --> 01:52.513
in Interrogation.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.581
DON:
Hey, what's going on?

01:53.614 --> 01:54.715
Nothing.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.584
You get Tolan to confess?

01:56.617 --> 01:57.551
Uh... no.

01:57.585 --> 01:58.586
DON:
Oh, I see.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.754
So you mean
literally nothing.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.556
What-what's with
these guys?

02:02.590 --> 02:04.392
Remember when the
Who got back together

02:04.425 --> 02:05.826
and decided to
go out on tour?

02:05.859 --> 02:08.596
Took them a little while
to get their groove back.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.299
Well, I'd better start
hearing the music soon.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.934
*

02:13.967 --> 02:15.603
(saw buzzing)

02:34.888 --> 02:37.157
(beeping)

02:48.802 --> 02:51.639
Don, a possible 2-11 in
progress at Pacific Westward.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.973
What do you mean
possible?

02:53.006 --> 02:54.575
The alarm went
off four times.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.477
Security guard thought
it was just a malfunction.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.845
Yeah, and?
Guard's not responding

02:57.878 --> 02:59.480
on his cell phone or radio.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.382
(siren wailing)

03:01.415 --> 03:02.716
DON:
All LAPD units be advised,

03:02.750 --> 03:06.587
FBI en route
one-three-five-six Park Plaza,

03:06.620 --> 03:08.256
Pacific Westward.

03:08.289 --> 03:11.292
Be advised, shut down code
three, we're five blocks out.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.402
What do you say, Gary?

03:21.435 --> 03:22.536
Got to stop meeting
like this, Eppes.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.372
What do you think?
Anything to this?

03:24.405 --> 03:25.539
Place seems quiet.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.941
Can't seem
to raise the guard.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.343
DAVID:
Check out the work truck

03:29.377 --> 03:30.143
by the open
hatch.

03:30.177 --> 03:33.247
City officer says
no one's working

03:33.281 --> 03:34.882
in the area
tonight.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.726
All right,
I'll take this one.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.801
All clear.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.014
FBI! Don't move!

04:08.316 --> 04:09.917
David!
I've got him.

04:09.950 --> 04:13.787
* I look in your eyes, I can
only see my own complexion *

04:13.821 --> 04:15.623
Clear.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.825
Whoa. Check
all this out.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.729
Come on!
Give it up!

04:21.762 --> 04:23.030
Only going
to make me mad!

04:27.968 --> 04:29.970
Oh, we got a body here.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.089
Still alive.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.325
Fifteen Lincoln,
we need a medic

04:51.359 --> 04:53.026
to make entry
as soon as

04:53.060 --> 04:54.462
the threat is
neutralized.

04:57.531 --> 05:00.033
(grunting)

05:01.535 --> 05:03.671
Next time, listen.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.412
Tear gas!

05:11.445 --> 05:13.080
(explosion)

05:13.113 --> 05:14.948
(coughing)

05:14.982 --> 05:17.951
(explosions)

05:17.985 --> 05:19.052
(coughing)

05:20.621 --> 05:21.822
David?
DAVID: He's on the run!

05:21.855 --> 05:23.791
DON:
Get a visual.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.065
(coughing)
DAVID: I got nothing, Don.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.834
(coughing)

05:33.867 --> 05:35.969
DAVID: All units, be advised, we
got a runner.

05:36.003 --> 05:36.970
All right.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.472
He said he's gone.

05:38.506 --> 05:41.008
Hey, we're in here
15 minutes, Eppes,

05:41.041 --> 05:43.076
and not a single box has blown.

05:43.110 --> 05:46.714
So, what the hell happened?

06:00.193 --> 06:03.497
It's pretty nice
for a bank, huh?

06:03.531 --> 06:05.466
Hundred grand a
year for a box?

06:05.499 --> 06:06.434
Thanks.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.569
Guy we caught is
Richard Fisk.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.704
Done some time in
France and in Russia.

06:10.738 --> 06:11.839
What for?

06:11.872 --> 06:13.173
Mostly high-end
burglaries.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.875
Museums, art
galleries.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.176
And this guy's
a real pro.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.178
He's not afraid
to do jail time,

06:18.211 --> 06:19.246
and he isn't
saying boo.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.848
All right, why don't you
check him out with Interpol?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.149
Okay.

06:22.182 --> 06:25.085
This is Mr. Friscia;
he's the president of the bank.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.787
I'm Don Eppes
with the FBI.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.990
Our clientele pays a
premium for discretion.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.493
This type of attention
makes them uncomfortable.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.094
Well, this canister is

06:34.127 --> 06:37.197
military grade,
which makes me uncomfortable.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.099
Well, we'd like to
see a visitor's log

06:39.132 --> 06:40.934
for last 24
hours, okay?

06:40.968 --> 06:42.436
That's not possible.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.171
We don't keep a video

06:44.204 --> 06:45.539
or a signature log.

06:45.573 --> 06:48.108
Well, you need a pass key
to get in, right?

06:48.141 --> 06:50.210
Well, the ID is anonymous.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.178
Our confidentiality

06:51.211 --> 06:52.680
is equivalent to a bank

06:52.713 --> 06:54.515
you might find
in the Cayman Islands.

06:54.548 --> 06:57.618
We're privately owned, so we
don't have to adhere to any FDIC

06:57.651 --> 06:59.152
rules or the U.S.
Bank Secrecy Act.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.021
WALKER:
Cayman Islands.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.590
That's where people
normally go

07:02.623 --> 07:03.857
if they've
got something

07:03.891 --> 07:04.892
to hide.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.159
DON:
So, Gare,

07:06.193 --> 07:07.461
no forced entry, huh?

07:07.495 --> 07:08.596
WALKER:
No.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.230
FRISCIA:
We use

07:10.263 --> 07:12.065
a state-of-the-art
biometric fingerprint system.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.734
No keys.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.968
Only the owner

07:15.002 --> 07:16.604
of the box can open it up.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.772
Well, what if somebody else
somehow did?

07:18.806 --> 07:21.074
There are over 2,000
safe deposit boxes here.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.176
What do you expect me
to do?

07:23.210 --> 07:24.878
Bring down customers one by one,

07:24.912 --> 07:26.580
tell them
they might have been robbed?

07:26.614 --> 07:28.549
All right, well,
we'll be back

07:28.582 --> 07:30.618
with warrants for the boxes
that were opened, okay?

07:30.651 --> 07:32.185
Excuse me, but

07:32.219 --> 07:34.955
you just said
you don't know which those are.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.758
Yeah, not yet.

07:40.027 --> 07:43.130
Hmm. Shutters at the Beach.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.999
Well, it's a nice place
to be invited for dinner.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.635
Uh, yeah, it's
a book party

07:47.668 --> 07:49.202
that my publisher's
throwing for me.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.904
Everyone's
getting invites.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.540
Isn't that crazy?

07:52.573 --> 07:55.108
I am so proud of you.
-Thank you.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.244
Millie said that you cancelled
your lecture next month. -Yeah.

07:57.277 --> 08:00.147
Well, it's the same
night as the party, so...

08:00.180 --> 08:01.582
Yeah, but she said
she moved it.

08:01.615 --> 08:02.750
And that's the same night

08:02.783 --> 08:04.184
that your parents are getting
into LAX,

08:04.217 --> 08:07.087
and I kind of thought
that'd be more important.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.890
Oh. Well, that's sweet,
but I don't want you

08:09.923 --> 08:12.259
to miss your lecture
just for that.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.194
Well, they're
your family.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.697
I want to be there
to welcome them.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.165
What's up?

08:18.198 --> 08:20.067
Hey, guys.
Hey. Oh, hey.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.268
Don said you'd
be coming by.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.203
Another bank
robbery, right?

08:23.236 --> 08:24.071
Private bank. Thousands

08:24.104 --> 08:26.206
of safe deposit boxes,
but we don't know

08:26.239 --> 08:28.709
how the thief got into them
or which boxes he chose.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.077
Oh. Check out
these acetone smears.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.179
It's perfect for a
hand path prediction.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.214
Mm, with an adaptation
of Listing's Law, right?

08:34.247 --> 08:36.617
Whatever that is,
that'll do it?

08:36.650 --> 08:39.620
Well, it's no different
than a, uh... a golf swing.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.221
You know, by watching
and analyzing the swing,

08:41.254 --> 08:42.856
we can tell
from the point of impact

08:42.890 --> 08:44.324
where exactly the ball
is going to end up

08:44.357 --> 08:46.193
without even looking
at the fairway.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.962
Now imagine
that the golfer is invisible.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.898
By looking at the motion
of the club

08:50.931 --> 08:53.867
as well as the point of impact,
we can reconstruct

08:53.901 --> 08:55.736
exactly how the golfer
was positioned.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.204
Now, we're using the same

08:57.237 --> 08:59.139
two ideas here:
your robber

08:59.172 --> 09:01.675
was moving his hand around,
looking for specific

09:01.709 --> 09:02.976
safe deposit boxes in the dark.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.311
AMITA: Even though we can't see
him,

09:04.344 --> 09:06.313
you know,
this model will help determine

09:06.346 --> 09:07.948
how fast
he was moving,

09:07.981 --> 09:09.316
which direction
he was headed in,

09:09.349 --> 09:11.719
and hopefully,
what he was looking at.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.089
Hello. DAVID: Hey, Lieutenant
Walker.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.025
Hey.
Those the gloves

09:18.058 --> 09:19.359
that SID found in the tunnel?

09:19.392 --> 09:21.829
Sure are. -I thought they were
being processed

09:21.862 --> 09:22.863
by our lab.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.197
So did I.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.066
Someone on your end
forgot to pick them up.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.669
Wait a minute.
I thought you were down

09:28.702 --> 09:29.870
at LAPD headquarters
yesterday.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.705
Bag and tag is your department,
right? -No, no. -Since when?

09:31.739 --> 09:33.073
Did you call...?
Gentlemen!

09:33.106 --> 09:35.175
If you don't
mind. I ran 'em.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.810
And they're clean on the inside.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.245
Must have worn two sets.

09:38.278 --> 09:42.315
But there's acetate
all over the fingertips.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.685
That how the robber
compromised the system?

09:44.718 --> 09:45.753
COLBY:
Those biometric

09:45.786 --> 09:47.721
locks can be defeated.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.692
Once you lift a print,

09:51.725 --> 09:52.592
it's possible to make a mold

09:52.626 --> 09:54.795
out of it and then
fake out the system.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.263
You learn that in spy school?

09:56.296 --> 09:57.765
Discovery Channel.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.733
Right. The robber--

09:59.767 --> 10:02.069
he had to know
which boxes to hit, right?

10:02.102 --> 10:04.404
Yeah, not to mention access
to the owners in order

10:04.437 --> 10:05.806
to lift their fingerprints.

10:05.839 --> 10:06.807
My guess is,

10:06.840 --> 10:09.109
it would be either an employee
or a customer.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.218
Hey, Larry.
How are you?

10:18.251 --> 10:19.687
"While being young

10:19.720 --> 10:22.656
"is an accident of time,
youth is a permanent

10:22.690 --> 10:23.824
state of mind."

10:23.857 --> 10:26.193
I totally agree...
and who said that?

10:26.226 --> 10:27.728
Frank Lloyd Wright.
Oh, yeah.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.162
Still designing homes

10:29.196 --> 10:31.031
the year he died at age 92.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.900
Does this apply to me?

10:32.933 --> 10:35.002
It's nice to see
a late bloomer

10:35.035 --> 10:36.303
in the garden of knowledge.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.871
Thank you.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.940
What the hell
was that?

10:39.973 --> 10:40.908
A CalSci tradition.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.376
Every Halloween, the
students drop pumpkins

10:43.410 --> 10:45.045
from the highest point
on campus.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.880
From the roof of the library?

10:46.914 --> 10:48.716
Oh!

10:48.749 --> 10:49.883
Yeah, the tradition
further holds

10:49.917 --> 10:51.218
that the pumpkins be dipped

10:51.251 --> 10:53.120
in liquid nitrogen
to intensify the explosion.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.955
Yeah, well, in that case, I'm
starting a new tradition.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.890
The frightened student dash.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.132
CHARLIE:
This is the square of one...

11:05.165 --> 11:06.233
and, uh...

11:06.266 --> 11:07.467
Oh, you know what?

11:07.500 --> 11:10.003
I'm going to head off,
speak to you later.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.439
So, about earlier...
About earlier...

11:12.472 --> 11:14.174
What was going on earlier?

11:14.207 --> 11:15.809
Come on,
don't say "nothing."

11:15.843 --> 11:19.813
I just don't want you
to miss your lecture.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.915
Stromsborg's doing it.
Okay?

11:21.949 --> 11:23.016
I mean,
he's obviously not me,

11:23.050 --> 11:25.819
but the students like
him just fine.

11:27.955 --> 11:30.758
What, you don't want me to meet
your parents, or something?

11:32.826 --> 11:35.095
Oh, I was joking.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.029
No, Charlie,

11:36.063 --> 11:37.931
of course, I want you
to meet my parents.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.132
I mean, I love you.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.968
It's just
that my dad,

11:41.001 --> 11:43.771
you know, he can be a little
difficult about this stuff.

11:43.804 --> 11:44.905
What kind of stuff?

11:44.938 --> 11:47.775
Me and... men,

11:47.808 --> 11:49.943
certain types of men.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.845
This isn't about me
being Jewish, is it?

11:51.879 --> 11:53.814
No. Charlie, no.

11:53.847 --> 11:57.484
But it is about you
not being Indian.

11:57.517 --> 12:00.220
Oh...

12:00.253 --> 12:02.790
That's encouraging.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.457
Um...

12:06.860 --> 12:09.997
I'm kind of sorry
I cancelled my lecture.

12:10.030 --> 12:14.067
Look, Charlie, I really don't
want us to fight about this.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.068
Charlie?

12:15.102 --> 12:16.837
Huh? No, neither do I.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.238
Neither do I.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.240
I just have to find Don.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.344
WALKER: Now, how your brother
was able to figure out

12:24.377 --> 12:26.513
which box was compromised
is beyond me.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.949
Hey, my boy's
a well-oiled machine.

12:28.982 --> 12:29.850
How you doing there?

12:29.883 --> 12:30.617
We're here to see
Mr. Friscia, please.

12:30.650 --> 12:33.053
Charlie is a
well-oiled machine.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.355
Wish I could say the same
for the rest of your squad.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.391
Why do you say that?

12:38.425 --> 12:40.828
Sinclair and Granger were
a lot more buttoned-down

12:40.861 --> 12:43.096
last time we worked
together, weren't they?

12:43.130 --> 12:45.799
I guess they're
working some stuff out.

12:45.833 --> 12:46.900
No offense, Eppes,

12:46.934 --> 12:50.003
but you're supposed to work
that stuff out for them.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.571
Oh? How do you suppose
I do that?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.273
You start by knocking
their heads together,

12:53.306 --> 12:54.808
and then you move on
from there.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.109
My way is,
I give them enough room,

12:56.143 --> 12:57.978
and, hopefully, things work out
for themselves...

12:58.011 --> 12:59.579
Mr. Piennar is waiting
for you in the vault.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.948
DON:
Okay, thanks.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.082
Thank you.
WOMAN: You're welcome.

13:04.217 --> 13:07.054
This is Mr. Piennar.
Hey, how are you?

13:07.087 --> 13:08.121
I'm Don Eppes, FBI.

13:08.155 --> 13:11.224
You have a warrant
to look in my security box, huh?

13:11.258 --> 13:12.392
We can get one.
Do we have to?

13:12.425 --> 13:14.928
We actually believe your box
may have been burglarized

13:14.962 --> 13:15.929
last night.

13:17.898 --> 13:18.966
(sighs)

13:29.109 --> 13:30.510
It's gone.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.245
Everything's gone.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.847
What was taken?

13:33.881 --> 13:35.415
Off the record?

13:35.448 --> 13:37.985
Okay, sure, off the record.

13:38.018 --> 13:41.021
There might have been some
gold coins in there.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.255
Oh, yeah. How much?

13:42.289 --> 13:44.424
Neighborhood of half a million.

13:44.457 --> 13:45.959
That's a nice neighborhood.

13:45.993 --> 13:46.927
Anyone else know
what you had in there?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.195
No, no. No one.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.596
WALKER:
Forgive me for asking--

13:49.629 --> 13:51.431
I'm just trying to figure out
where you're from.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.500
Those coins wouldn't happen
to have been Krugerrands,

13:53.533 --> 13:55.502
would they?
And if they were?

13:55.535 --> 13:57.104
Well, I'd just ask
what you were doing

13:57.137 --> 13:58.872
with a half million
dollars

13:58.906 --> 14:01.942
in South African gold coins
that can't be traced.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.879
I've said enough.

14:07.014 --> 14:07.948
You...

14:09.983 --> 14:11.885
...you'll be hearing
from my lawyer. Gentlemen.

14:15.655 --> 14:18.926
It says Piennar defused bombs
in the second Congo war.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.493
DAVID:
Yeah, a mercenary.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.930
That's the kind of gig
that will pay in Krugerrands--

14:22.963 --> 14:24.965
pure gold, it will exchange
anywhere in the world.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.100
It says here that he lived
in Monaco last.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.102
Then it looks like
he fell off

14:29.136 --> 14:30.971
the face of the Earth
in 2000.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.573
There's not much here
before '95 either.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.108
You know,
if I was living in Monaco,

14:35.142 --> 14:37.077
I don't think I'd be doing
any heavy lifting.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.111
No...

14:38.145 --> 14:39.312
Krugerrands are
a commodity.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.081
There's only ten dealers
in Los Angeles

14:41.114 --> 14:43.083
that will transfer them
to cash.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.517
So the Treasury Department
alerted all of them.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.087
And Walker's
hunch was right--

14:47.120 --> 14:49.156
all four of them got deposits
for 125 grand each.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.291
None of these dealers have seen
this many in a long time.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.960
Any video on the deposits?

14:52.993 --> 14:54.661
Brinks trucks delivered
each of them.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.163
But it gets stranger.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.297
Each place was given
instructions

14:57.330 --> 14:59.132
to transfer the gold to cash

14:59.166 --> 15:01.468
and then wire the funds
directly to the charities

15:01.501 --> 15:03.036
on the next page.

15:03.070 --> 15:06.206
Habitat for Troubled Kids,
and Give Youth Hope...

15:06.239 --> 15:07.440
Who breaks
into a bank,

15:07.474 --> 15:10.643
steals a half a million
in gold coins...

15:10.677 --> 15:12.980
And then donates it
to The Artists for Youth?

15:13.013 --> 15:16.016
Looks like we're dealing with
a real-life Robin Hood here.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.989
DON: Stop Running, Give Youth
Hope,

15:22.022 --> 15:24.992
The Artists for Youth,
Habitat for Troubled Kids...

15:25.025 --> 15:27.527
If we take into account
all the work and the expense--

15:27.560 --> 15:31.098
never mind the risk-- for only
a half a million dollars,

15:31.131 --> 15:33.466
and then he gave it
all away to charity...

15:33.500 --> 15:34.634
We got Charlie looking
for new boxes.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.404
If Piennar is dirty,

15:37.437 --> 15:39.072
maybe Robin Hood's
other victims are, too.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.540
He must've picked them
for a reason.

15:40.573 --> 15:43.210
So, if we figure out the motive,
we can figure out the man?

15:48.048 --> 15:50.217
Hey, Charlie.
Don't knock...

15:50.250 --> 15:53.620
Oh... (chuckles)
We're just trying to avoid

15:53.653 --> 15:55.588
getting decapitated
by flying pumpkins.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.158
Your problem seems
to outweigh

15:58.191 --> 15:59.326
exploding gourds.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.694
Well, this bank robber broke
into a safety deposit box,

16:01.728 --> 16:04.031
and according
to my modeling,

16:04.064 --> 16:05.598
at least two of the boxes
were compromised.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.200
I thought I was closing in
on the two.

16:07.234 --> 16:10.170
You're using a kinematic model
to predict hand path

16:10.203 --> 16:12.272
in point-to-point
movements.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.074
I'm trying to make some
adjustments to this program,

16:14.107 --> 16:16.209
but without any help,
I'm sort of hitting a dead end.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.045
Speaking of which,
where's Amita?

16:18.078 --> 16:18.911
I haven't seen
her all day.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.081
She wasn't at the house
this morning.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.116
She's busy.
You haven't seen her either?

16:23.150 --> 16:25.685
Isn't she teaching
a class today?

16:25.718 --> 16:27.087
I-I... I don't know,
I don't know.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.723
Of course, this all assumes

16:30.757 --> 16:33.093
that the speed of the thief
was consistent,

16:33.126 --> 16:35.095
that he knew exactly
where he was going.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.164
When it could have been
irregular.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.032
Well, as my own recent
trajectories taught me--

16:39.066 --> 16:41.468
we don't always know exactly
where we're heading.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.735
Hey, speaking of...

16:42.769 --> 16:44.804
Aren't you supposed to be
at the monastery?

16:44.837 --> 16:46.406
You've been spending a lot
of time around here lately.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.508
Yeah. Well,
your model and my life,

16:48.541 --> 16:52.112
they both share the same
problem-- too restrictive.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.680
Like your thief...

16:53.713 --> 16:59.119
who knows where I'm going,
how fast I'll get there.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.354
Charlie found
two more boxes.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.223
Ali Karimi...

17:03.256 --> 17:05.058
WALKER:
Iraqi antique dealer,

17:05.092 --> 17:06.793
left Baghdad in 2001.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.428
Believed to have
stolen antiquities

17:08.461 --> 17:11.431
from the Iraqi National Museum.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.100
Next one's even better.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.468
DAVID:
D.J. Rodriguez?

17:15.502 --> 17:17.470
We've been after this guy
for a while.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.839
I thought
he was in Mexico.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.241
COLBY: Or the Bahamas or South
America--

17:21.274 --> 17:23.210
depending on who
you want to believe.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.245
Wherever he is,
if D.J. Rodriguez is in LA,

17:25.278 --> 17:26.446
that's where he's going to stay.

17:26.479 --> 17:27.680
Getting a warrant
for his box is easy,

17:27.714 --> 17:30.417
but Charlie was right--
it was empty.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.319
Yeah. Well, I don't need Charlie
to tell me what's missing--

17:32.352 --> 17:34.087
either money, drugs, or both.

17:34.121 --> 17:35.588
First, we have
a mercenary,

17:35.622 --> 17:38.225
now a drug dealer and a fence
for stolen antiquities.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.627
This Robin Hood is picky
about his victims.

17:44.297 --> 17:47.334
You know, I'd have an
easier time with this

17:47.367 --> 17:49.302
if Amita were around, you know?
-Uh-huh.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.139
Because this is more her area
of expertise.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.840
I know, you mentioned that.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.509
Yeah, I could really use
her help on this one.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.710
You want to talk
about it?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.179
Is it obvious?

17:59.212 --> 18:02.115
Yeah. What?

18:02.149 --> 18:04.651
She's afraid that when
her parents come into town

18:04.684 --> 18:08.888
next month, that her dad
will have issues with me

18:08.921 --> 18:10.757
not being born in India.

18:10.790 --> 18:14.161
I-I...
I feel kind of rejected.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.295
Are you sure
it's you being rejected?

18:15.328 --> 18:18.265
I mean, you know, Charlie,
parents have these ideals,

18:18.298 --> 18:20.633
these perfect plans
for their kids.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.270
What was your perfect plan?

18:23.303 --> 18:25.138
That Don would play
professional baseball,

18:25.172 --> 18:27.240
and that you would help me
start a planning firm.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.609
I never knew that.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.245
Are you disappointed?
No, of course not.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.880
Nah. You guys help
people in ways

18:33.913 --> 18:35.448
I could never have imagined.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.617
Tell that to Mr. Ramanujan.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.387
Charlie, I'm sure of it,
when he meets you,

18:40.420 --> 18:42.822
he will want nothing more
for his daughter.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.599
(clears throat)
I'm not really sure

18:52.632 --> 18:55.335
what I can do
to assist in your investigation.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.705
We believe the person
who broke into the bank

18:58.738 --> 18:59.839
targeted specific

18:59.872 --> 19:01.841
safety deposit boxes.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.075
Have you checked
yours recently?

19:03.109 --> 19:08.681
After I heard what happened,
naturally, I went right down.

19:08.715 --> 19:09.682
And what did you find?

19:09.716 --> 19:16.723
Let's just say your assumptions
may be correct.

19:16.756 --> 19:17.790
Listen, if we don't know
what's inside,

19:17.824 --> 19:19.326
there's no way
we can return it to you.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.394
MEGAN:
Unless it wasn't yours

19:21.428 --> 19:23.730
to begin with.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.565
We know that you deal
in antiquities.

19:25.598 --> 19:30.570
Agent Reeves,
I would rather lose my money

19:30.603 --> 19:32.372
than answer your question.

19:34.974 --> 19:39.446
This vase was stolen during
the invasion of Baghdad.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.414
Your report says this is
worth $8 million.

19:41.448 --> 19:44.551
To many Iraqis
it's considered priceless.

19:44.584 --> 19:45.485
My colleagues

19:45.518 --> 19:48.621
are elated
at the prospect of its return.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.257
Right, and it just appeared
on your front doorstep?

19:50.290 --> 19:54.694
You have no idea who left it?
No name, no number?

19:54.727 --> 19:56.896
When someone calls
to drop off a vase

19:56.929 --> 19:59.399
that's a mid-fourth
millennium B.C.,

19:59.432 --> 20:01.334
you don't interrogate them.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.870
You say thank you
and ask where the reward money

20:03.903 --> 20:05.605
should be sent.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.340
Reward money?

20:07.374 --> 20:08.608
WOMAN:
Twenty percent.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.744
Don't think you're dealing with
your typical felon here, either.

20:11.778 --> 20:15.815
Had me split the cash
between these charities.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.787
I Can Dream Foundation,

20:20.820 --> 20:24.491
Laugh, Concern for Tomorrow,
and Leaders for a Better Now.

20:29.362 --> 20:33.800
Kind of strange, Rodriguez
making a buy here this morning,

20:33.833 --> 20:35.602
and Narco getting
that anonymous tip.

20:35.635 --> 20:39.406
Convenient for D.J. Rodriguez
to be showing his face in L.A.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.274
after all this time.

20:41.308 --> 20:42.241
Well, he wants his stash back,

20:42.275 --> 20:44.911
or whatever they ripped
off from his box.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.346
I'm curious where the tip
came from.

20:46.379 --> 20:49.316
Who knows?
Could be Robin Hood himself.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.483
He's gone after
blood money,

20:50.517 --> 20:52.852
he's gone
after the antique dealer.

20:52.885 --> 20:56.989
Maybe this time,
the donation isn't the stash...

20:57.023 --> 20:58.991
What, Rodriguez?

21:00.627 --> 21:01.628
Oh, here they come.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.068
Oh, man,
that much hardware--

21:09.101 --> 21:11.070
this isn't a buy,
this is a hit.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.539
Colby, you'd better
take them, take them.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.309
(siren wailing)

21:33.593 --> 21:35.362
Drop your weapon!

21:36.396 --> 21:38.097
(siren wailing)

21:38.130 --> 21:39.399
Hey, Eppes,

21:39.432 --> 21:41.468
you ever play polo?

21:41.501 --> 21:42.569
DON: All right, here we go,
giddy up.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.983
Well, that's your sport, Gary.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.385
Boy's out cold.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.630
You're a popular
guy, D.J.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.632
Got warrants in
three states--

22:12.665 --> 22:13.833
not including the
federal stuff.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.502
Do I look like the kind

22:15.535 --> 22:17.404
that scares easy?
-You look like the kind

22:17.437 --> 22:19.506
who's not going to be voting
until 2020--

22:19.539 --> 22:21.073
unless you come up
with a good story.

22:21.107 --> 22:22.742
I was set up.
We know

22:22.775 --> 22:23.876
about the safe deposit box.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.513
Guy who hit you hit
other people, too.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.080
Got any idea who that might be?

22:28.114 --> 22:29.449
A dead man when I find him.

22:29.482 --> 22:30.617
Yeah, well,
we both know that

22:30.650 --> 22:31.317
it's gonna be a long time

22:31.350 --> 22:32.519
before you're
in the position

22:32.552 --> 22:34.120
to look, so...

22:36.489 --> 22:39.459
Some guy calls me.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.761
Says he's got two keys
of my heroin,

22:41.794 --> 22:42.929
rooster marker
to prove it.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.397
Says he wants

22:44.431 --> 22:46.399
to sell it back to me.

22:46.433 --> 22:50.102
Word's out, anyone can rob
from D.J. Rodriguez.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.405
I came in to clear that up.

23:01.581 --> 23:02.782
You thinking

23:02.815 --> 23:04.851
about being up there again?
-No.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.786
Actually, I'm staring
at a chrysalis.

23:06.819 --> 23:08.655
Oh.
The butterfly

23:08.688 --> 23:10.189
that emerges

23:10.222 --> 23:12.525
will in no way resemble
the caterpillar

23:12.559 --> 23:13.693
that it once was.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.662
Be a total stranger
to itself.

23:15.695 --> 23:18.064
All it really
knows is

23:18.097 --> 23:22.001
that someday
it must fly and...

23:22.034 --> 23:23.603
rejoin the
dance of life.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.204
You're thinking
of leaving the monastery?

23:25.237 --> 23:28.074
Well, it's been
three months

23:28.107 --> 23:30.209
since I returned from
the space station.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.445
Eventually,
introspection must,

23:32.479 --> 23:34.514
give way to...

23:34.547 --> 23:35.848
well,

23:35.882 --> 23:38.017
everything else.

23:42.589 --> 23:43.723
Megan Reeves,
I got your message.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.458
Hi, Charlie.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.158
(clears throat)

23:46.192 --> 23:47.694
I wanted to give you these.

23:47.727 --> 23:48.828
Oh, all right.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.798
Stop Running,
Give Youth Hope.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.199
Uh, nine charities

23:53.232 --> 23:55.568
that our Robin Hood has donated
to. -Uh-huh.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.069
And I can't find a psychological
commonality

23:57.103 --> 23:58.170
(phone rings) between them.
I was hoping

23:58.204 --> 24:00.139
maybe you could find one of
another kind and... -Yeah.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.140
I gotta take this.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.912
Miss her?

24:05.945 --> 24:07.179
Megan?

24:07.213 --> 24:09.549
Well, I mean, I
did just see her.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.551
You know what I mean.
-Well,

24:11.584 --> 24:13.953
she does still make the
phenylethylamine race

24:13.986 --> 24:15.187
through the blood.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.856
How romantic.

24:16.889 --> 24:19.559
Well, one needs more then a pull
of molecules, Charles.

24:19.592 --> 24:20.827
One needs a sense
of timing.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.695
Hey, noticeably absent

24:22.729 --> 24:24.831
has been a certain combinatorics
professor.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.833
Is it possible your own affairs
of the heart

24:26.866 --> 24:29.168
have heightened your empathy?

24:29.201 --> 24:31.671
Ah, Larry, love is one puzzle
after another.

24:31.704 --> 24:34.006
You know, in quantum
experiments,

24:34.040 --> 24:35.675
when we change
our minds,

24:35.708 --> 24:37.677
we change the state
of matter itself.

24:37.710 --> 24:40.012
How deeply our thoughts
can effect our relationships.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.782
Grayson said that.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.518
He also said that
to make a difference,

24:45.552 --> 24:48.688
you have to move
beyond your own ego,

24:48.721 --> 24:50.523
and open yourself

24:50.557 --> 24:53.626
to the vast intelligence
that surrounds us.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.063
You're right.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.099
About what?

25:00.132 --> 25:02.769
WALKER:
"Rob from the rich,

25:02.802 --> 25:03.870
give to the poor."

25:03.903 --> 25:05.872
Is that what you would call
a delusional personality?

25:05.905 --> 25:07.239
A delusional

25:07.273 --> 25:08.908
personality is often paranoid.

25:08.941 --> 25:12.244
Now, our guy has been
meticulous, calculated.

25:12.278 --> 25:13.412
Right.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.815
Wilshire Division found this
on the doorstep yesterday.

25:15.848 --> 25:16.749
Look at the symbol.

25:16.783 --> 25:18.017
A rooster.

25:18.050 --> 25:19.719
That's Rodriguez's brand?
The Krugerrands,

25:19.752 --> 25:21.654
the vase, Rodriguez,
even his drugs.

25:21.688 --> 25:24.023
I mean, this guy is keeping
nothing for himself.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.792
We've polygraphed all

25:25.825 --> 25:26.659
the employees at the bank.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.528
WALKER:
What about him?

25:31.297 --> 25:32.865
They all passed with
flying colors.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.133
I take it
you people are

25:34.166 --> 25:35.602
no further along?
These things

25:35.635 --> 25:36.969
take time.
Which I don't have.

25:37.003 --> 25:40.272
I received this email
45 minutes ago.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.809
"Three secrets out.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.310
"More to come.

25:44.343 --> 25:47.046
Ten million
silences me."

25:47.079 --> 25:48.948
Listen, giving
into extortion

25:48.981 --> 25:50.082
is a really
bad idea.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.818
I'm way beyond

25:51.851 --> 25:53.319
losing clients now,

25:53.352 --> 25:55.154
as well as taking your advice.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.769
Hey, I've been looking
all over for you.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.203
I left you two messages.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.205
I know.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.974
I needed some time to think.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.976
Come here.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.979
I love you.

26:20.012 --> 26:22.248
You know that, right?

26:22.281 --> 26:24.617
But it's always
nice to hear it.

26:24.651 --> 26:26.085
We have a great life
ahead of us.

26:26.118 --> 26:29.088
I never meant to put pressure
on you like that.

26:29.121 --> 26:32.725
And as far
as your dad goes,

26:32.759 --> 26:35.762
when you're ready,
I'd love to meet him.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.630
Thank you.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.166
I don't know.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.934
Maybe after you win
your Fields Medal.

26:41.968 --> 26:43.703
You really think
I'll win a Fields?

26:43.736 --> 26:44.871
I do.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.005
Why else do you think
I'm with you?

26:46.038 --> 26:47.239
Thought it was
for my hair.

26:47.273 --> 26:50.209
Well, there's
that, too.

26:50.242 --> 26:52.078
There's something coming
up on your program.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.781
Oh, yeah, hey,
look at that.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.683
Uh, I gotta go.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.651
Okay.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.257
Mmm.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.659
Hold that thought.
-Okay.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.362
Just make sure we get duplicates
out to everyone just in case...

27:10.396 --> 27:11.731
CHARLIE:
Hey, hey.

27:11.764 --> 27:12.899
Sorry, I just ran over here.

27:12.932 --> 27:13.833
You can always call, you know.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.001
Uh, well, some of these things

27:15.034 --> 27:16.035
need to be explained

27:16.068 --> 27:17.904
in person.
Yeah, like what?

27:17.937 --> 27:19.972
Like the, uh, the link
to your charities.

27:20.006 --> 27:22.809
It's all about machine learning
and recommender systems.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.143
All right?

27:24.176 --> 27:25.778
I've gotten used
to not understanding

27:25.812 --> 27:26.713
what the hell
you're talking about.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.815
It's great to see you, too,
Lieutenant.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.083
Uh, well, just think about
an on-line dating service.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.852
Now, Professor,
what makes you think

27:32.885 --> 27:34.921
that I would be familiar
with a concept like that?

27:34.954 --> 27:35.822
(laughs)

27:35.855 --> 27:37.223
Hypothetically.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.424
You fill out

27:38.457 --> 27:40.059
a personality profile...

27:40.092 --> 27:43.195
gender, height, education...

27:43.229 --> 27:45.865
personal beliefs
like religion, politics...

27:45.898 --> 27:48.735
You also reveal subtle details
about yourself.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.737
These questions aren't
just designed

27:50.770 --> 27:52.972
to look for physical matches
and simple hobbies.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.841
They're highly advanced
profiles

27:54.874 --> 27:56.809
that look for intangibles

27:56.843 --> 27:58.277
that will help you
find the perfect mate.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.712
Now, these charities,

27:59.746 --> 28:01.013
they're all local,

28:01.047 --> 28:02.815
and they're all youth-based
in their mission.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.851
So, I had to look
for subtler undercurrents,

28:04.884 --> 28:06.418
and I found that some
of them provided

28:06.452 --> 28:08.921
medical care,
or food or counseling.

28:08.955 --> 28:10.923
But they all provided it

28:10.957 --> 28:12.424
in person

28:12.458 --> 28:15.427
through a common location
called Promises House.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.196
That's a teen runaway center,

28:17.229 --> 28:18.297
that burned down

28:18.330 --> 28:19.465
five years ago.
Right.

28:19.498 --> 28:21.868
And it specialized in teen
runaways and abuse victims--

28:21.901 --> 28:24.871
and it provide a large array
of services,

28:24.904 --> 28:26.839
some that these other
charities overlapped.

28:26.873 --> 28:27.907
All right, they'd have

28:27.940 --> 28:29.375
to pick up the slack.
So, what

28:29.408 --> 28:30.810
maybe Robin Hood worked there?

28:30.843 --> 28:32.178
I'll get in touch
with the Arson Unit

28:32.211 --> 28:33.379
make 'em pull the original case.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.447
Hey, David and Colby
have been following

28:35.481 --> 28:36.648
Peter Friscia.

28:36.682 --> 28:38.450
Looks like his bank's about
to pay the extortion money.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.975
Don, this guy's
definitely

29:03.009 --> 29:04.076
about to make a drop.

29:04.110 --> 29:05.311
Suspect is out
on foot.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.146
Pier 44, Dock Bay.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.314
All right, then get out,

29:08.347 --> 29:10.049
and follow, I'm gonna send
an air unit.

29:16.188 --> 29:18.324
All right, let's
not burn 'em.

29:18.357 --> 29:19.926
Robin Hood's a pro.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.794
Figure he knows we're here
or what to look for.

29:25.364 --> 29:26.966
He has a walkie--

29:26.999 --> 29:28.000
must be how

29:28.034 --> 29:29.001
he's getting
instructions.

29:36.142 --> 29:38.110
This Robin Hood guy

29:38.144 --> 29:39.478
is definitely coming by boat.
We need to move up.

29:39.511 --> 29:40.980
He sees us,
he's just gonna take off,

29:41.013 --> 29:42.815
and we can't chase him
on the water.

29:42.849 --> 29:44.851
There's no bird
overhead yet.

29:44.884 --> 29:47.153
Don, it looks like
our guy's gonna

29:47.186 --> 29:49.021
be coming by boat.
-All right, I'll,

29:49.055 --> 29:50.122
I'll call Harbor Patrol.
You guys stay

29:50.156 --> 29:51.824
close, okay?

29:51.858 --> 29:53.459
DAVID: What the hell is he
doing?

29:53.492 --> 29:55.461
I don't know
I mean the ocean's open;

29:55.494 --> 29:57.063
there's no craft approaching.

30:06.338 --> 30:09.008
All right,
all agents move in now.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.276
Let's go.
Let's go.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.112
Don't!

30:13.145 --> 30:14.313
Don't!

30:14.346 --> 30:15.081
You-- get back!

30:15.114 --> 30:16.315
Put the bag down!

30:16.348 --> 30:17.316
Move! Get back!

30:17.349 --> 30:19.085
Get back!

30:20.152 --> 30:21.954
David, take it.
Got it.

30:34.901 --> 30:36.635
He's gone.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.569
And so is the money.

30:38.604 --> 30:39.838
Come on.

30:48.614 --> 30:51.918
ERT found this
underwater,

30:51.951 --> 30:53.920
attached to the other end
of the cable.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.624
Spare battery

30:58.657 --> 31:00.326
for an underwater propulsion
device.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.328
Would explain
how he got out of there

31:02.361 --> 31:03.662
before the Coast Guard
found him.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.231
What in the hell?

31:05.264 --> 31:07.099
You know, if he left it for us,
it's, uh,

31:07.133 --> 31:09.368
it's probably
worth running.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.403
Hey, what happened
out there?

31:11.437 --> 31:13.940
Blew it, Don.

31:13.973 --> 31:14.740
What's with
you guys?

31:14.773 --> 31:16.208
I mean, do I need
to split you up?

31:16.242 --> 31:17.209
Is that what's
going on?

31:17.243 --> 31:18.677
No, we're good.

31:18.710 --> 31:19.979
Yeah, not with me, you're not.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.047
Get it together, you hear me?

31:30.256 --> 31:32.925
Well, I guess that's
what happens when you

31:32.959 --> 31:34.593
"let these things take care of
themselves." -All right, look,

31:34.626 --> 31:36.328
I took your advice,
we'll see if you're right.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.130
Problem's not
with your people.

31:38.164 --> 31:40.199
FBI didn't draw your name
out of a hat

31:40.232 --> 31:41.667
to run the violent crime squad.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.435
They expect you to deal
with their problems,

31:43.469 --> 31:45.237
same as you do in the field.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.106
(sighs)

31:47.139 --> 31:48.374
I don't know.
Look, you know,

31:48.407 --> 31:50.376
I told you they got me
seeing a therapist.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.178
Who isn't these days?

31:53.645 --> 31:56.248
They've got me working on,
you know, trust issues

31:56.282 --> 31:58.250
and delegating,
stuff like that.

31:58.284 --> 32:01.287
I don't know if I'm ready
to be their therapist, too.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.290
I'm not talking about any kind
of touchy-feely crap here!

32:04.323 --> 32:05.591
You're their boss.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.259
They're looking for
somebody to follow.

32:07.293 --> 32:10.496
Well, your guys worship you,
I'll give you that.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.364
If they do, it's 'cause I don't
give a damn if they don't.

32:12.398 --> 32:16.702
Hey, guys, that license plate
came back to a 2002 Mercedes,

32:16.735 --> 32:18.270
registered to an Alex Evans,

32:18.304 --> 32:20.539
happens to be a
career arsonist.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.174
Anyone look at him
for Promises House?

32:22.208 --> 32:24.343
He's listed
as a "Person of Interest."

32:24.376 --> 32:26.212
I'd say Robin Hood wants us
to look a little harder.

32:26.245 --> 32:29.281
David and Colby just went out
to rattle his cage.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.250
Did I miss
something?

32:40.392 --> 32:41.293
How you doing?

32:41.327 --> 32:42.661
What happened to your
license plate, man?

32:42.694 --> 32:44.196
Don't know.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.164
Kids, probably.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.202
Dad's not interested
in talking to cops.

32:50.236 --> 32:52.171
Yeah, how's he feel about FBI?

32:52.204 --> 32:54.040
(chuckling):
Hates them even more.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.407
How about you tell him to
come on outside anyway?

32:55.441 --> 32:57.143
Man, look...

32:57.176 --> 32:59.178
(groaning)

32:59.211 --> 33:00.379
Who says we're
out of sync?

33:00.412 --> 33:01.380
Hey!

33:01.413 --> 33:03.282
What'd my boy do?
Misdemeanor

33:03.315 --> 33:04.650
stupidity.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.552
Actually,
we came here to talk to you.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.487
Oh, about what?
Promises House.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.356
A week after it burned down,

33:10.389 --> 33:12.124
you were suddenly flushed
with money.

33:12.158 --> 33:13.259
Yeah, enough to buy yourself

33:13.292 --> 33:15.361
a brand-new Mercedes Benz.

33:15.394 --> 33:16.362
In cash.

33:16.395 --> 33:17.229
Now, you wouldn't want

33:17.263 --> 33:18.597
to save us all some time
and just confess

33:18.630 --> 33:20.199
right now, would you?

33:21.300 --> 33:23.835
Yeah, okay.

33:27.706 --> 33:28.474
Have a seat.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.342
DON: He cuts a deal just like
that.

33:30.376 --> 33:31.343
Maybe if he
sees himself

33:31.377 --> 33:34.213
as a Robin Hood, this is
like an elaborate ritual

33:34.246 --> 33:36.115
of confession
and repentance.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.749
Different build
than the guy I saw.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.218
You know,
you look at his record here,

33:39.251 --> 33:40.286
and this guy
just doesn't have the skills.

33:40.319 --> 33:41.287
No way.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.355
It was a straight contract job.

33:43.389 --> 33:46.792
Single burn point, a small
pipe bomb by the furnace.

33:46.825 --> 33:48.360
All right, so who hired you?

33:48.394 --> 33:49.395
Pete Friscia.

33:49.428 --> 33:52.331
DAVID: The president of Pacific
Westward Bank?

33:52.364 --> 33:55.134
Yeah, and I have proof.

33:55.167 --> 33:56.602
So Friscia used to

33:56.635 --> 34:00.206
run a real estate company called
Hart-Fam Industries.

34:00.239 --> 34:02.574
They developed
the Los Angeles Complex.

34:02.608 --> 34:06.078
This corner here is
where Promises House once stood.

34:06.112 --> 34:07.346
The property
on that corner

34:07.379 --> 34:09.248
Friscia sold for $20 million.

34:09.281 --> 34:10.449
He wanted to develop the land.

34:10.482 --> 34:12.451
The city wouldn't
evict runaways,

34:12.484 --> 34:14.153
so he torched

34:14.186 --> 34:15.387
their home.

34:17.323 --> 34:20.226
I'll be with you
in a minute.

34:20.259 --> 34:21.393
No, this can't wait.

34:21.427 --> 34:22.428
Excuse us, sir, thank you.

34:22.461 --> 34:23.729
What the hell is this?

34:23.762 --> 34:24.863
Well...
(handcuffs clicking)

34:24.896 --> 34:28.600
EVANS (over speaker):
I get fifty now and fifty later.

34:28.634 --> 34:32.104
FRISCIA: Fine, fine, address is
4011 Hill Street,

34:32.138 --> 34:33.739
place called Promises House.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.374
Now, what does it say about you

34:35.407 --> 34:37.343
that a professional arsonist
tape-recorded the meeting

34:37.376 --> 34:38.444
to protect himself?

34:38.477 --> 34:39.811
Let's go, come on.

34:44.150 --> 34:47.219
You know, Charles, I'm
sensing frustration.

34:47.253 --> 34:48.887
I really think I need
to talk to Amita.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.289
No, no, we're fine.

34:50.322 --> 34:51.423
It's this
hand path prediction model.

34:51.457 --> 34:52.691
It's, it's complete

34:52.724 --> 34:55.327
and yet there's still something
that doesn't make sense to me.

34:55.361 --> 34:56.328
Will you please look at this?

34:56.362 --> 34:57.796
Robin Hood passed up

34:57.829 --> 35:00.632
all these safety deposit boxes
and then hit this one first,

35:00.666 --> 35:01.800
then went back.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.169
You said he was
a professional,

35:03.202 --> 35:05.371
so efficiency should
dictate his moves.

35:05.404 --> 35:06.372
Right.

35:06.405 --> 35:07.473
Okay, so you start

35:07.506 --> 35:08.607
with the most
expensive item.

35:08.640 --> 35:09.775
Exactly, but he didn't.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.243
He started
with the Krugerrands.

35:11.277 --> 35:12.911
The less time you have,

35:12.944 --> 35:14.346
the more efficient
you need to be.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.281
He would have
started with a box

35:15.314 --> 35:17.216
that he was certain
he could open fast.

35:17.249 --> 35:18.850
Here, come take
a look at these.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.519
Look. The first box,

35:20.552 --> 35:22.588
it has barely any
acetone residue on it.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.726
So maybe he didn't start
with that box

35:27.759 --> 35:30.462
because he was aware
of its contents.

35:30.496 --> 35:31.330
Maybe he started with it

35:31.363 --> 35:33.399
because he was certain
he could open it.

35:33.432 --> 35:36.668
Which would make him
in all probability the owner.

35:37.969 --> 35:38.937
COLBY:
Courtesy

35:38.970 --> 35:40.706
of the South African
Consulate.

35:40.739 --> 35:41.673
Hmm.

35:41.707 --> 35:46.612
J.W. Piennar--
real name is Steven Buckley.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.547
What's
a reconnaissance commando?

35:48.580 --> 35:49.515
Basically a Navy SEAL

35:49.548 --> 35:51.750
with the surveillance skills
of an FBI agent.

35:51.783 --> 35:53.819
I mean,
if this guy is our Robin Hood,

35:53.852 --> 35:54.853
breaking into a bank vault

35:54.886 --> 35:55.887
would have been
a snap.

35:55.921 --> 35:57.623
Buckley, huh?

35:57.656 --> 36:00.859
So he pulls the heist,
blackmails Friscia,

36:00.892 --> 36:02.494
and then gets him put away
for arson.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.530
But why?
And how would he know that Evans

36:04.563 --> 36:05.297
was going to confess?

36:05.331 --> 36:06.698
DAVID: I can answer that
question.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.434
Treasury Department

36:08.467 --> 36:10.269
just faxed these over.

36:10.302 --> 36:11.937
Looks like we finally found
the $10 million

36:11.970 --> 36:13.505
Robin Hood extorted
from the bank.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.541
DAVID:
Central Bahama Trust,

36:15.574 --> 36:17.543
RDP Belgium Bank,

36:17.576 --> 36:19.845
Solomon Islands
International.

36:19.878 --> 36:21.480
What's it have to do with me?

36:21.513 --> 36:23.715
I'd say plenty considering
they have about $10 million

36:23.749 --> 36:25.584
of your money.

36:25.617 --> 36:28.354
I already have my deal.

36:28.387 --> 36:31.257
A man going to jail
could get lost,

36:31.290 --> 36:32.591
wind up
in solitary

36:32.624 --> 36:37.229
for a very long time.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.499
(chuckles)

36:41.533 --> 36:43.502
You've seen my kid.

36:43.535 --> 36:44.503
He's a freaking idiot.

36:44.536 --> 36:45.871
There's not a
chance in hell

36:45.904 --> 36:47.506
he's going to take care of me

36:47.539 --> 36:49.941
in my old age.

36:49.975 --> 36:52.478
So, if someone offers you
$500,000

36:52.511 --> 36:54.246
to tell him who hired you,

36:54.280 --> 36:56.415
another nine-and-a-half
million to confess

36:56.448 --> 36:58.484
and do a six-year bid...

36:59.585 --> 37:02.254
...what would you do?

37:11.463 --> 37:13.565
A little stop on your
way out of town?

37:13.599 --> 37:15.567
A lot easier to figure it out
once we knew your real name.

37:15.601 --> 37:19.671
Your brother responded the
night Promises House burned.

37:22.341 --> 37:25.711
That fire made Peter Friscia
a multi-millionaire.

37:27.379 --> 37:30.649
Know what my brother got?

37:30.682 --> 37:31.450
Lungs full of asbestos.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.585
So what, your family
lost a lawsuit

37:33.619 --> 37:35.020
and you decided
to hit the bank?

37:35.053 --> 37:36.488
Is that it?
A man of your skills

37:36.522 --> 37:38.957
looking for a little payback.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.759
It'd be easy to get
a box at a bank,

37:40.792 --> 37:43.329
do some surveillance.

37:43.362 --> 37:45.397
Maybe find some other
dirty customers,

37:45.431 --> 37:48.400
maybe grab a print off a glass,
say, at the bar.

37:50.902 --> 37:53.572
I mean, we're just speaking
hypothetically.

37:58.410 --> 38:02.581
If I did,

38:02.614 --> 38:05.951
you'd have to know
I wouldn't keep a nickel.

38:05.984 --> 38:09.755
All the money, the effort
would go to nailing Friscia.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.557
And Promises House?

38:11.590 --> 38:13.892
It's what my brother died for.

38:13.925 --> 38:17.396
It would seem right
to keep their work going, eh?

38:19.931 --> 38:23.602
You know, men like me,

38:23.635 --> 38:27.906
men in my profession...
don't have any family.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.812
Rafer, his kids...

38:34.913 --> 38:37.716
...I had them instead.

38:41.086 --> 38:44.723
So we hear you might be on a
flight to Venezuela tonight.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.725
You know, if
it were me,

38:46.758 --> 38:49.461
I'd stay there a
good long while.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.975
What's going on?

39:04.009 --> 39:05.844
You're letting him go?
Do we have a case?

39:05.877 --> 39:07.679
No.

39:07.713 --> 39:08.680
Do we have other
priorities?

39:08.714 --> 39:09.615
Yes.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.650
We might catch some
heat for this, Don.

39:11.683 --> 39:12.884
Ah, don't worry
about it.

39:12.918 --> 39:15.854
If anyone catches any heat,
it'll be me.

39:24.430 --> 39:25.464
Yes.

39:25.497 --> 39:28.434
Oh, no, please don't tell me
you're encouraging this.

39:28.467 --> 39:29.835
Don't blame Larry,
this was my idea.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.102
Yeah, your father
thought it would help him

39:31.136 --> 39:32.070
connect
with the younger students.

39:32.103 --> 39:33.705
CHARLIE: Well, then, what's your
excuse?

39:33.739 --> 39:34.906
I don't know.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.475
I just like
watching things explode.

39:36.508 --> 39:37.543
Oh, of course.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.778
Whoa.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.680
What's all that about?

39:41.713 --> 39:43.715
The two great adult
influences in my life

39:43.749 --> 39:45.784
are heading off to
blow up pumpkins.

39:45.817 --> 39:49.855
Um...
about my problem earlier.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.757
Uh, I think
I might have a solution.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.792
Yeah, what's that?

39:53.825 --> 39:56.728
My father and your father.

39:56.762 --> 39:58.697
I think that we should
get them together.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.198
Because?

40:00.231 --> 40:01.399
Because...

40:01.433 --> 40:05.771
I haven't seen a Ramanujan who
can say no to an Eppes yet.

40:16.582 --> 40:19.117
Ah... that's a good crew
you got there, Eppes.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.219
That's right.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.921
I think you're right,
you know.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.690
When it comes down to it,
I do--

40:24.723 --> 40:27.158
I mean, I got to admit
I want to be their friend.

40:27.192 --> 40:28.694
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.629
Ah, it's up
to you, Eppes.

40:30.662 --> 40:32.063
Maybe one of
me is enough.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.066
I think
it's just--

40:35.100 --> 40:37.068
it's all about learning
how to listen

40:37.102 --> 40:38.236
to their personal problems.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.939
Is that your answer?

40:40.972 --> 40:42.774
That's what I like about
the new generation--

40:42.808 --> 40:43.975
they got an answer
for everything.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.811
Uh-huh.

40:45.844 --> 40:48.213
I don't have an answer for
dating a co-worker, though.

40:49.214 --> 40:51.182
WALKER:
Reeves?

40:51.216 --> 40:53.184
You and Reeves?
No, no, no, no.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.920
You didn't know
I was dating Liz Warner?

40:54.953 --> 40:57.989
Oh-ho-ho!

40:58.023 --> 40:59.825
Well, you won't find
me throwing any stones

40:59.858 --> 41:00.826
with three ex-wives.

41:00.859 --> 41:02.093
Last one was a sergeant.

41:02.127 --> 41:04.863
Where are you guys
off to?

41:04.896 --> 41:06.231
Going to catch a drink.

41:06.264 --> 41:07.265
You guys want to come?

41:07.298 --> 41:08.266
COLBY:
This guy's actually paying,

41:08.299 --> 41:11.036
so we're going
to drink some top-shelf stuff.

41:11.069 --> 41:12.270
Oh, I think you got the
lieutenant's attention

41:12.303 --> 41:13.404
with that one.

41:13.438 --> 41:15.874
Scotch always tastes better
if somebody else is buying.

41:15.907 --> 41:17.075
COLBY: All right.
I'm not paying for you.

41:17.108 --> 41:18.176
DON:
I'll come.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.178
I don't think I remember
the last time we did this.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.213
'Cause I don't think we have.
All right, well,

41:22.247 --> 41:23.782
here's to new
traditions.
