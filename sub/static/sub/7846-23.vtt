Got it.

01:01.609 --> 01:02.918
Got it, got it. No!

01:02.995 --> 01:04.324
- Louie, pull your weight!
- Um,

01:04.400 --> 01:05.666
I'm stabilizing.

01:05.743 --> 01:07.884
Grunts lift.
Leaders stabilize.

01:10.206 --> 01:12.131
Ahh, life on a boat, huh?

01:12.208 --> 01:13.933
The lively rocking
of the waves!

01:14.010 --> 01:15.780
Sleeping next
to a dangerous boiler!

01:15.857 --> 01:18.363
And what's that?
A longshoreman cursing?!

01:18.440 --> 01:19.445
Fun!

01:19.522 --> 01:21.010
Anything's better
than the mansion

01:21.087 --> 01:22.387
with that selfish old miser.

01:22.464 --> 01:23.853
Aw, that's not fair.

01:23.930 --> 01:26.595
Scrooge isn't
that old and selfish.

01:27.023 --> 01:29.782
Okay, but
in the most lovable way!

01:30.101 --> 01:33.171
Home sweet home. Huh?

01:34.951 --> 01:37.579
Umm... I got snacks!

01:43.976 --> 01:45.470
Uhh... heh.

01:45.608 --> 01:47.530
Hmm? Ah...

01:48.280 --> 01:49.567
Mmm!

01:49.770 --> 01:52.428
Wait, where's Dewey?!

01:52.505 --> 01:54.173
Nope. Right here.

01:54.250 --> 01:56.316
- Not stealing the boat.
- Oh!

01:56.393 --> 02:00.155
Yep. Back to the good ol' days.
Woo-woo.

02:02.124 --> 02:03.428
Woo!

02:03.505 --> 02:05.364
Bbbb blah.

02:08.471 --> 02:10.883
Big day, Magica. Real big day.

02:10.961 --> 02:12.695
The eclipse is at hand,

02:12.772 --> 02:15.429
my plan is flawless.

02:19.075 --> 02:21.535
Let. Me. Go!

02:21.645 --> 02:23.580
Oh, that's right.
I forgot you were here.

02:23.657 --> 02:25.410
I won't let you do this!

02:25.487 --> 02:26.811
Yeah, uh-huh.

02:26.888 --> 02:28.453
Oh, except at the moment
of the eclipse,

02:28.530 --> 02:30.855
my powers
will finally unleash,

02:30.932 --> 02:35.117
and I'll be an invincible
juggernaut of dark magic!

02:35.194 --> 02:36.707
So, you know...

02:39.364 --> 02:41.915
Now that you've
gained the trust of Scrooge's brats,

02:41.992 --> 02:44.035
I can use your body
to get inside the house.

02:44.112 --> 02:46.248
Then I'll weaken
Scrooge with this,

02:46.325 --> 02:48.673
snatch the Number One Dime
at the height of the eclipse,

02:48.750 --> 02:50.058
unleash my full power,

02:50.135 --> 02:53.019
and use it to destroy everything
Scrooge has ever loved!

02:53.096 --> 02:55.046
Ha ha ha! Unh!

02:57.279 --> 02:59.033
Howdy, Mr. McDee!

02:59.110 --> 03:01.615
Don't worry, I'm not here
to check on you

03:01.692 --> 03:03.527
on account
of everyone moving out

03:03.604 --> 03:06.112
because the boys blame you for
launching their mom to space

03:06.189 --> 03:07.312
and orphaning them.

03:07.389 --> 03:10.194
I'm here to take you out
for ice cream!

03:10.271 --> 03:12.885
Mmm, sounds good, right?

03:12.962 --> 03:15.879
Family crisis!
I mean, ice cream!

03:15.956 --> 03:17.600
<i> Go away.</i>

03:17.801 --> 03:21.045
Out?! Moved?! Ice cream?!

03:21.122 --> 03:22.507
Without those kids
to let me in,

03:22.584 --> 03:26.017
how am I supposed to get
my evil, evil vengeance?!

03:28.007 --> 03:29.914
No. I will defeat
Scrooge McDuck.

03:29.991 --> 03:31.723
I am the dark shadow
lying in wait!

03:31.800 --> 03:33.116
I am the stuff of nightmares

03:33.193 --> 03:34.921
lurking in the hidden recesses
of your mind!

03:34.998 --> 03:37.866
I am... Aaaah!

03:40.947 --> 03:43.168
All right. Just have
to convince Scrooge

03:43.245 --> 03:45.359
that I'm
a typical little girl.

03:48.664 --> 03:50.023
Gee whiz, mister.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.893
It's me, that
insufferable whelp, Lena.

03:52.970 --> 03:55.239
The little urchins
invited me over to...

03:55.316 --> 03:58.330
Uh... what do children like?
Play marbles?

03:58.407 --> 03:59.682
<i>The children are gone.</i>

03:59.759 --> 04:01.913
<i>Leave me alone. Forever.</i>

04:09.185 --> 04:13.138
Aw, shucks. Webby
said this would happen.

04:13.221 --> 04:14.494
<i>What did she say?</i>

04:14.571 --> 04:16.603
That you wouldn't be able
to handle the kids leaving

04:16.680 --> 04:18.317
and have
an old man meltdown.

04:18.394 --> 04:19.697
I thought better of you.

04:19.774 --> 04:21.296
Guess I was wrong.

04:23.899 --> 04:27.237
At last.
A vanquishing for the ages,

04:27.314 --> 04:30.978
a final clash between
the Sorceress of the Shadows

04:31.055 --> 04:35.347
and the world's greatest
adventurer, Scrooge Mc...

04:40.949 --> 04:42.244
Wait, what?

04:46.055 --> 04:49.209
Hey, guys, I think you
misplaced this box.

04:49.286 --> 04:51.334
We're throwing
that away.

04:52.281 --> 04:53.935
Yah!

04:54.563 --> 04:56.820
What?! The Druid's Cup?

04:56.897 --> 04:59.646
This Mount Neverrest
T-shirt?

04:59.723 --> 05:01.405
The Golden Khopesh
of Toth Ra

05:01.482 --> 05:03.250
that you conned
Launchpad out of?!

05:03.327 --> 05:05.912
Those artifacts are special!

05:06.347 --> 05:08.086
It's just old junk.

05:08.370 --> 05:09.456
Yah!

05:11.000 --> 05:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:20.945 --> 05:23.100
Goodbye.

05:23.265 --> 05:24.695
Ah!

05:24.876 --> 05:26.132
Sploosh.

05:27.530 --> 05:28.975
- Seriously?
- You're still holding it.

05:29.052 --> 05:30.631
Oh, fine!

05:31.909 --> 05:33.798
- Ah!
- Aaah!

05:34.891 --> 05:37.486
No no no no no
no no no no!

05:39.341 --> 05:41.288
I can't believe
it's really over.

05:41.365 --> 05:44.123
I mean, they're falling
apart and they're family.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.216
Are we next?

05:45.293 --> 05:46.287
Don't worry.

05:46.364 --> 05:49.416
I've crashed literally hundreds
of Mr. McDee's vehicles,

05:49.493 --> 05:50.756
and he always
gets over it.

05:50.833 --> 05:52.413
The boys will, too.

05:52.490 --> 05:54.580
I don't know.
This feels different.

05:54.657 --> 05:57.495
They blame Scrooge for
their mom's disappearance.

05:57.572 --> 05:58.750
It'll blow over.

05:58.827 --> 06:00.272
They'll be a happy family

06:00.349 --> 06:02.533
living in the mansion
before you know it.

06:02.610 --> 06:04.590
Boys! Good news!

06:04.667 --> 06:07.219
Where have you
always wanted to go?

06:07.296 --> 06:08.926
Into the water
to go get my Khopesh?

06:09.003 --> 06:11.342
What?
No. Cape Suzette!

06:11.419 --> 06:13.405
We're moving there
tomorrow!

06:13.482 --> 06:15.546
- A new town?! -Finally.
- Cape Suzette, here we come!

06:15.623 --> 06:17.881
- They're moving tomorrow?!
- They're moving tomorrow?!

06:17.958 --> 06:19.799
We have no time!

06:19.876 --> 06:22.653
The only family
I've ever known gone forever!

06:22.730 --> 06:24.276
Ohhh! What do we do?!

06:24.353 --> 06:25.772
This is bad! Real bad!

06:25.849 --> 06:27.488
Will Dewey and I
still be friends?!

06:27.565 --> 06:28.791
Who will I call
for advice?!

06:28.868 --> 06:30.787
Do they have phones
in Cape Suzette?!

06:30.864 --> 06:33.231
Okay, okay, one of us
needs to stay calm here.

06:33.308 --> 06:34.611
So... you?

06:34.688 --> 06:36.623
All we need
is a simple plan

06:36.700 --> 06:38.358
to remind Scrooge
and the boys

06:38.435 --> 06:40.280
- how much they need each other.
- Huh?

06:40.357 --> 06:42.244
- An amazingly fun and elaborate
- An amazingly fun and elaborate

06:42.321 --> 06:45.357
- farewell dinner party scheme. Yes!
- Farewell dinner party scheme. Yes!

06:45.434 --> 06:48.200
Step one, we throw the boys
a farewell party

06:48.277 --> 06:49.981
to convince them
they don't want to move.

06:50.058 --> 06:53.520
Step two, reveal
surprise guest... Scrooge...

06:53.597 --> 06:55.961
And remind them how much
they all miss each other.

06:56.038 --> 06:58.574
Step three...
There is no step three,

06:58.651 --> 07:01.013
because we just nailed it
in two steps!

07:01.151 --> 07:02.449
Whoo!

07:02.526 --> 07:03.980
Ow! - Ow!

07:04.057 --> 07:05.855
- Whooo!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

07:11.734 --> 07:14.806
Ugh! How long has
your housekeeping staff been gone?

07:14.883 --> 07:16.450
Three days.

07:16.542 --> 07:19.219
So how are
my so-called kin?

07:19.296 --> 07:23.302
Miserable, no doubt,
living on that disgusting boat.

07:23.379 --> 07:26.379
I'm obviously doing
much better than they are.

07:26.456 --> 07:28.012
Ah! Pesky possum!

07:28.089 --> 07:29.587
Keeps eating my anchovies!

07:34.972 --> 07:36.415
Scrooge!

07:36.492 --> 07:39.585
That sad sack of feathers
is not Scrooge.

07:42.168 --> 07:46.919
The Scrooge McDuck I know is a
shrewd, conquering hero of legend.

07:48.741 --> 07:50.574
Mm. Eh...

07:54.776 --> 07:56.871
Unless...
this is all a trick.

07:56.948 --> 07:58.606
Yes, that's it!
Of course!

07:58.683 --> 07:59.934
He senses something.

08:00.011 --> 08:02.588
He's trying to convince me
he's a pathetic loser,

08:02.665 --> 08:04.419
hoping
I'll make a mistake!

08:04.503 --> 08:07.549
Ha ha! You can't
fool me, Scroogie!

08:07.626 --> 08:09.872
I am the one who fools!

08:12.027 --> 08:14.179
One sip. Lights out.
Grab the dime.

08:14.256 --> 08:16.439
Then I enact my vengeance!

08:17.800 --> 08:20.646
Thanks for
the pep talk, Lena.

08:25.641 --> 08:28.629
Huh. It says here that Cape
Suzette has a pretty neat park.

08:28.706 --> 08:30.007
They just
got a second swing.

08:30.084 --> 08:34.246
And the Cape Suzette saltine cracker
factory gives public tours.

08:34.323 --> 08:36.602
And they let you sample
the crackers at least.

08:36.679 --> 08:37.754
- Yeah.
- I mean,

08:37.831 --> 08:39.690
this place used
to sound exciting, right?

08:39.767 --> 08:42.147
Ho ho!
Meet the new Dewey,

08:42.224 --> 08:44.862
the dashing, debonair
yachtsman of Cape Suzette!

08:44.939 --> 08:47.231
Ah! Fancy boat shoes!

08:47.308 --> 08:50.122
Pain worth it
for the fancy boat shoes.

08:51.468 --> 08:53.700
Eee! Yah!

08:56.972 --> 09:00.119
"Dear Hubert, Dewford,
and Lew-...

09:00.196 --> 09:02.968
you are cordially invited
to your own dining room

09:03.045 --> 09:04.994
for a dinner full
of heartwarming memories

09:05.071 --> 09:06.851
and surprises,
question mark.

09:06.928 --> 09:09.763
Will you attend,
'yay' or nay"?

09:19.090 --> 09:21.493
- They're coming! Whoo!
- They're coming! Whoo!

09:22.616 --> 09:23.823
Ooh!

09:23.927 --> 09:25.893
Now we just have
to get Scrooge to show up.

09:25.970 --> 09:26.992
But how?

09:27.069 --> 09:28.828
We're gonna have
to be subtle.

09:28.905 --> 09:31.964
Hello, Mr. McDee! Come to a
party on Donald's houseboat

09:32.041 --> 09:33.267
for, um...

09:33.344 --> 09:35.846
Oh, uh... Mm-mm, uh, hmm?

09:35.923 --> 09:38.603
Um, a game of charades?

09:38.680 --> 09:40.684
- Free food!
<i>-  I'll be there.</i>

09:40.761 --> 09:42.549
You will?!

09:42.626 --> 09:44.355
But I'll
only eat the finest lobster,

09:44.432 --> 09:45.699
caviar, canapés.

09:45.776 --> 09:47.900
And make sure no one starts
eating until I get there,

09:47.977 --> 09:49.932
as I consider it
the height of rudeness.

09:50.009 --> 09:52.184
Bless me bagpipes!
Good day!

09:52.261 --> 09:54.064
Ha!
Dinner officially ruined!

09:54.141 --> 09:56.285
Hm! Now, back
to destroying Scrooge.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.469
Where's
that blasted nutmeg tea?

09:58.546 --> 09:59.955
Ooh. Convenient.

10:00.032 --> 10:01.903
Don't worry!
I'll get it!

10:06.640 --> 10:08.041
Waack! Huh?

10:08.147 --> 10:09.439
What? Huh?

10:10.479 --> 10:12.738
Hey, what's the big idea?!

10:12.815 --> 10:14.248
Didn't the boys tell you,

10:14.325 --> 10:16.727
we're making you a
heartwarming farewell dinner!

10:16.804 --> 10:18.831
Oh, fine.

10:25.267 --> 10:27.861
Ha ha ha ha ha!

10:31.467 --> 10:34.020
One man's nephews'
former bedroom

10:34.097 --> 10:36.474
is another man's pantry,
I always say.

10:36.551 --> 10:37.837
Ugh!

10:37.914 --> 10:39.564
Ow.

10:39.641 --> 10:42.517
He is very committed to
this "looking pathetic" trap.

10:43.327 --> 10:45.984
Have some tea.
It'll settle you.

10:46.061 --> 10:47.282
Thanks.

10:51.030 --> 10:52.597
Mmmmm!

11:00.762 --> 11:03.592
Sweet, playful marbles.

11:03.669 --> 11:04.977
Three to a bag.

11:05.054 --> 11:08.214
Red, green, and
that rascal blue marble,

11:08.291 --> 11:11.694
always rolling
whichever way it wants.

11:12.457 --> 11:15.818
And ungrateful, the lot
of them, at every turn!

11:15.895 --> 11:17.000
After all I did
for them,

11:17.077 --> 11:18.716
and they just throw it
in my face!

11:18.793 --> 11:20.851
Yeah, there's nothing
worse than marbles.

11:20.928 --> 11:22.307
Tea?

11:22.384 --> 11:23.954
I'm talking about family.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.577
Ugh, tell me about it.

11:25.654 --> 11:27.879
They disobey you,
run you ragged,

11:27.956 --> 11:30.472
don't follow through
on elaborate revenge plots!

11:30.549 --> 11:33.943
They spend your money, take
over your home, cause trouble,

11:34.020 --> 11:35.511
worm their
way into your head

11:35.588 --> 11:37.902
with fond memories
that you cannae get out,

11:37.979 --> 11:39.837
no matter how hard
you try!

11:39.914 --> 11:42.404
Cheers to ridding
fond memories!

11:42.481 --> 11:45.684
And then they leave without
so much as a thank you!

11:45.783 --> 11:47.912
Forget family!
Who needs 'em?

11:47.989 --> 11:49.511
I'll drink to that!

11:49.588 --> 11:50.669
Aah!

11:50.746 --> 11:52.750
Of all the idiotic...

11:52.827 --> 11:56.218
I mean,
I'll go make you another.

11:57.486 --> 11:59.557
Come on, guys,
you're gonna be late

11:59.634 --> 12:01.888
for the greatest dinner
of all time!

12:01.965 --> 12:04.193
A culinary journey
through Duckburg!

12:04.270 --> 12:06.585
Every bite reminding you
how much you love

12:06.662 --> 12:09.433
this town you're leaving
behind for some dumb reason.

12:09.510 --> 12:11.748
Mmm, the "family-tini!"

12:11.825 --> 12:13.492
Old family recipe.

12:13.569 --> 12:16.175
Tastes like the loving
embrace of family.

12:17.466 --> 12:18.691
Ahh!

12:18.768 --> 12:20.378
Are these melted popsicles
in cups?

12:20.455 --> 12:22.040
The stirrer has
a riddle on it.

12:22.117 --> 12:25.144
Yeah, you won't get fancy stuff
like this in Cape Suzette.

12:25.221 --> 12:26.855
That's probably for the best.

12:26.932 --> 12:28.728
I heard there was
a farewell party.

12:28.805 --> 12:30.662
I brought ambrosia salad.

12:30.739 --> 12:32.611
Uh!

12:32.688 --> 12:34.779
Granny's a master spy!

12:34.856 --> 12:36.138
She'll expose our plan!

12:36.215 --> 12:37.462
How'd she know
about the party?!

12:37.539 --> 12:41.467
I dunno. I specifically wrote on
her invitation, "don't come!"

12:41.989 --> 12:43.622
And where is Scrooge?

12:43.699 --> 12:45.764
He was supposed to be here
half an hour ago!

12:45.841 --> 12:48.636
Okay, okay, okay, just need
to stall till he arrives.

12:48.713 --> 12:50.542
A toast!

12:50.619 --> 12:52.640
The dictionary defines
"family"

12:52.717 --> 12:57.502
as "a group of people bound together
by commitment and unwavering loyalty."

12:57.579 --> 12:59.483
So let's each say
one nice thing

12:59.560 --> 13:01.829
about a particular relative
of ours.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.308
Ahem. Boys?

13:03.385 --> 13:05.977
Uch, fine.
I'll go with Uncle Donald,

13:06.054 --> 13:08.337
because... well, he's
devoted to his family.

13:08.414 --> 13:10.350
Unlike others.

13:11.059 --> 13:13.073
Yeah, and he's thoughtful.

13:13.150 --> 13:15.190
- Don't forget passionate.
- Aww!

13:15.267 --> 13:16.920
I like
his sailor getup!

13:17.106 --> 13:20.045
Ugh! Okay,
we all love Donald.

13:20.122 --> 13:22.640
But how about a relative
that is not in this room,

13:22.717 --> 13:24.930
who is over 80,
and is very, very rich?

13:25.007 --> 13:26.510
Why are you guys
acting so weird?

13:26.587 --> 13:27.832
Uh, we're not!

13:27.909 --> 13:29.513
Emergency
bounce house!

13:31.079 --> 13:34.783
Webby, Launchpad. A word?

13:36.752 --> 13:38.777
This is a parent trap,
isn't it?

13:38.854 --> 13:40.845
You're trying
to manufacture sentiment

13:40.922 --> 13:42.236
to force Scrooge
and the boys

13:42.313 --> 13:44.515
to come together
against their wills.

13:44.833 --> 13:46.042
I want in.

13:46.119 --> 13:47.215
- Really?!
- Really?!

13:47.292 --> 13:48.762
If this family
won't come together,

13:48.839 --> 13:50.114
we'll have to do it
for them.

13:50.191 --> 13:51.920
I assume
you invited Scrooge.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.358
Yeah,
but he's running late.

13:53.435 --> 13:54.959
Okay. I'll get
the boys and Donald

13:55.036 --> 13:56.543
emotionally primed
while we wait.

13:56.620 --> 13:59.363
I'm a former agent
and a grandmother.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.968
I know how
to weaponize guilt.

14:06.630 --> 14:08.211
Here, tea.

14:08.288 --> 14:11.904
This time
in a convenient no-spill cup.

14:12.435 --> 14:15.447
Finally, without
those kids dragging me off

14:15.524 --> 14:18.028
on rip-roaring,
unforgettable adventures,

14:18.105 --> 14:20.118
I can just sit here
in peace,

14:20.195 --> 14:22.144
stare vacantly at my money,

14:22.221 --> 14:25.101
and sulk
like an arrant recluse.

14:26.474 --> 14:29.648
On an unrelated note,
how's that tea?

14:31.750 --> 14:35.101
Spilt. Like my life.

14:36.664 --> 14:38.215
Oh, my word, it's not a trap.

14:38.292 --> 14:40.307
He's actually
become this pathetic!

14:40.384 --> 14:42.075
How dare you make me
pity you!

14:42.152 --> 14:45.432
This is not how I pictured killing you
in my head for the last 15 years!

14:45.509 --> 14:46.941
Go on. Scram now.

14:47.018 --> 14:48.947
Let me wallow in peace.

14:49.024 --> 14:50.561
Toughen up, man!

14:50.638 --> 14:52.256
You conquered Plain Awful,

14:52.333 --> 14:54.723
you found the Last Crown
of the Mongols,

14:54.800 --> 14:59.024
you even defeated
some very powerful dark forces!

14:59.101 --> 15:00.512
You don't need family!

15:00.589 --> 15:03.407
You're Scrooge McDuck!
Act like it!

15:03.484 --> 15:06.957
I am Scrooge McDuck.

15:07.034 --> 15:09.014
I was adventuring
before them.

15:09.091 --> 15:11.448
No one helped me then,
and I don't need help now!

15:11.525 --> 15:13.772
Yes! They were
all in your way.

15:13.849 --> 15:15.252
Mooching, freeloading.

15:15.329 --> 15:18.652
Trying to weaken you
with compassion and caring.

15:18.729 --> 15:20.290
I'm going back to basics.

15:20.367 --> 15:24.006
Doggedly driven, bare,
barmy Scrooge flying solo!

15:24.083 --> 15:27.060
I don't need Duckburg
or the mansion or the Bin!

15:27.137 --> 15:28.652
I can start from scratch!

15:28.729 --> 15:30.901
I dinnae need
these pince-nez spectacles,

15:30.978 --> 15:33.134
this handmade
silk-weave top hat,

15:33.232 --> 15:35.272
these satin spatterdashes!

15:35.349 --> 15:39.330
Yes, yes, yes!
I don't need anything!

15:39.407 --> 15:41.866
Not even
your Number One Dime!

15:41.943 --> 15:43.194
Well, that's crazy.

15:43.271 --> 15:44.481
Of course I need my dime.

15:44.558 --> 15:46.337
What about starting
from scratch?

15:46.414 --> 15:49.017
Just give me the dime, and
I'll throw it away for you.

15:49.094 --> 15:51.622
Why would a young lass
be so interested

15:51.699 --> 15:55.524
in getting her hands
on my ol' Number One Dime?

15:57.638 --> 15:59.903
- Maybe you should be going.
- Rraaah!

15:59.980 --> 16:02.766
Lena! What the...?
Have you gone daft?!

16:04.132 --> 16:06.157
Look, I'm not gonna
fight a child!

16:06.234 --> 16:07.304
Aaaah!

16:07.381 --> 16:09.894
Okay, fine!

16:11.852 --> 16:13.372
Huh? Ah!

16:13.449 --> 16:14.832
Eh?

16:23.505 --> 16:24.922
It cannae be.

16:45.033 --> 16:47.399
Feed my power,
Dark Eclipse,

16:47.476 --> 16:49.764
free my form from the abyss.

16:49.841 --> 16:52.462
Dormant magic now unchain,

16:52.539 --> 16:57.087
the Shadow Queen
be whole again!

16:57.164 --> 16:59.212
Ha ha! Yes!

16:59.328 --> 17:03.629
The magic! The body! I'm back!

17:07.868 --> 17:11.902
Hello, Scroogie.
I've missed you.

17:13.377 --> 17:15.813
Magica DeSpell,

17:15.890 --> 17:19.977
you blackhearted wretch
of the foulest lineage!

17:20.054 --> 17:21.665
Impossible! How?!

17:21.742 --> 17:23.180
Why don't you ask
your housekeeper's

17:23.257 --> 17:24.791
granddaughter's
new best friend?

17:24.868 --> 17:27.137
You have a confusing family
structure, you know that?

17:27.214 --> 17:28.811
You got
your stupid body back,

17:28.888 --> 17:30.020
now leave us alone!

17:30.097 --> 17:32.571
Yes, scat,
you rapacious ogress!

17:34.422 --> 17:37.621
Awww, but I just got here.

17:50.283 --> 17:54.199
Apple shortbread pie with
a scoop of sea salt ice cream.

17:54.276 --> 17:56.613
A common farewell dessert
in certain parts.

17:56.690 --> 17:58.115
Finally. Some real food.

17:58.192 --> 17:59.995
Oh, I'm so sorry.

18:00.072 --> 18:02.784
This was Scrooge's
favorite dessert.

18:02.861 --> 18:05.550
Oh, I don't want to remind you
of that horrid man

18:05.627 --> 18:07.438
who lost your mother
all those years ago,

18:07.515 --> 18:09.001
even if it was
an accident

18:09.078 --> 18:10.294
that tore him up
for ten years,

18:10.371 --> 18:12.296
propelling him into
a desperate search attempt

18:12.373 --> 18:14.631
that left him broken
and nearly bankrupt.

18:14.708 --> 18:16.501
Wait, bankrupt? Really?

18:16.578 --> 18:18.556
But I understand,
you're upset

18:18.633 --> 18:20.397
because you lost
one family member,

18:20.474 --> 18:22.315
which was terrible
and painful,

18:22.392 --> 18:24.910
so you decided you should
go ahead and lose another.

18:24.987 --> 18:28.059
Brilliant. Makes
perfect rational sense.

18:28.252 --> 18:29.738
Yeah, nailed it, Mrs. B.

18:29.815 --> 18:32.983
Yes, distance yourself
even further from his life

18:33.060 --> 18:35.079
and forsake family
altogether.

18:35.156 --> 18:37.198
That will
definitely fix it.

18:37.275 --> 18:39.210
No! It'll do
the opposite of that!

18:39.287 --> 18:40.657
Perhaps
it's worth considering

18:40.734 --> 18:42.622
that the reason Scrooge
closed himself off

18:42.699 --> 18:45.780
was because the loss of Della was
the hardest thing he'd ever faced,

18:45.857 --> 18:47.299
harder than any adventure.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.187
It's not that
he didn't care,

18:49.264 --> 18:52.829
it's that he cared about family
more than anything in the world.

18:52.906 --> 18:55.393
And perhaps he still does.

18:55.470 --> 18:57.174
But I'm
just the housekeeper.

18:57.251 --> 18:58.299
What do I know?

18:58.376 --> 19:01.109
A lot!
This lady knows a lot!

19:12.760 --> 19:15.079
You, wee
tenebrious traitor!

19:15.156 --> 19:16.689
We welcomed you
into our home,

19:16.766 --> 19:19.611
only to have you unleash
this repugnant beast-monger!

19:19.688 --> 19:21.865
She's my aunt!
She made me do it!

19:21.942 --> 19:25.556
Mmm! Family!
Good for nothing!

19:25.633 --> 19:27.695
Left me completely
vulnerable to this!

19:27.772 --> 19:30.028
Please.
Magica only got in here

19:30.105 --> 19:31.675
'cause you threw
your family out.

19:31.752 --> 19:33.306
My family's
good for nothing.

19:33.383 --> 19:35.092
Your family is amazing.

19:35.169 --> 19:37.438
You fight and get into trouble,
but it doesn't matter,

19:37.515 --> 19:39.347
because you, I don't know,

19:39.424 --> 19:40.802
love each other
or something.

19:40.879 --> 19:42.777
Dude, I wish
I had your family.

19:45.260 --> 19:47.045
You're right, lass.

19:47.122 --> 19:48.749
Help me get
my family back,

19:48.826 --> 19:51.723
and you'll have
a place in it.

19:52.252 --> 19:55.106
We're all stronger
together. Ready?

19:55.908 --> 19:57.300
I'll see what I can do.

19:57.377 --> 20:02.947
Come on, you Mephistophelian
Medusa, let's... Oh!

20:03.024 --> 20:06.243
Sorry, I was just watching you
rally for a triumphant comeback.

20:06.320 --> 20:08.305
So sad. So futile.

20:08.382 --> 20:09.437
Now where was I?

20:09.514 --> 20:11.613
Oh, yes. Revenge!

20:13.351 --> 20:15.190
No! Not again!

20:15.267 --> 20:17.087
Don't send me back!

20:17.164 --> 20:19.260
Noooo!

20:19.369 --> 20:20.792
Bless me bagpipes.

20:20.869 --> 20:22.282
Curse you, DeSpell!

20:22.359 --> 20:25.448
No, no, Scrooge.
Curse you.

20:28.179 --> 20:30.154
Aaah!

20:30.283 --> 20:34.652
Mm, not the most
inspiring final words.

20:37.010 --> 20:39.901
Now let's toast
to a fine farewell meal,

20:39.978 --> 20:42.520
topped with a dash
of perspective.

20:44.283 --> 20:46.433
So, this whole thing
was to guilt us

20:46.510 --> 20:47.918
into going
back to the mansion?

20:47.995 --> 20:49.280
Well, it's not gonna work.

20:49.357 --> 20:50.954
Sorry,
but it's too late.

20:51.031 --> 20:53.090
We're going to Cape Suzette
with our real family,

20:53.167 --> 20:55.395
and that's that,
right, Uncle Donald?

20:57.713 --> 21:00.809
No. Mrs. B's right.

21:00.892 --> 21:02.732
Uncle Scrooge needs us,

21:02.809 --> 21:04.946
and we need him.

21:05.023 --> 21:09.106
Our family has been
apart too long.

21:11.556 --> 21:14.641
It's time for us
to come together.

21:14.718 --> 21:16.627
Come here, boys.

21:16.704 --> 21:18.016
Wait, wait, wait.

21:18.093 --> 21:22.059
But... but the Spear.
And Mom. And... and...

21:40.855 --> 21:42.067
Family?

21:42.144 --> 21:43.428
Trapped.

21:43.987 --> 21:46.517
Let's go back
to the mansion!

21:57.227 --> 21:59.365
Aw, phooey.

22:03.591 --> 22:06.267
Ha ha ha ha ha!

22:09.815 --> 22:12.029
Aah!

22:19.174 --> 22:22.340
Come to me,
my shadow puppets!

22:25.039 --> 22:26.900
Aah! Oh! Ooh!

22:26.977 --> 22:29.000
Hey! $20!

22:34.062 --> 22:38.093
Ah! The perfect vantage point
to view the lunar eclipse.

22:38.170 --> 22:40.431
Just me,
the night sky,

22:40.508 --> 22:42.590
and a swirling shadow vortex.

22:42.667 --> 22:44.940
A swirling shadow vortex?!

22:45.578 --> 22:46.790
Aah!

22:46.867 --> 22:48.301
Blathering Blatherskite!

22:48.378 --> 22:50.440
Whoa!

22:52.987 --> 22:54.622
Whoa!

22:55.759 --> 22:57.045
Where are you going?!

22:57.122 --> 22:58.965
You're my shadow,
you hear?

22:59.064 --> 23:01.676
Curse you, me!

23:07.455 --> 23:10.815
So... still going
to Cape Suzette, right?

23:10.892 --> 23:12.777
Cool, yeah,
I'll start the boat.

23:19.455 --> 23:22.949
Take it in, Scroogie!

23:48.744 --> 23:50.521
Magica DeSpell!

23:50.598 --> 23:51.915
Wait, who?

23:51.992 --> 23:53.293
Magica DeSpell.

23:53.370 --> 23:55.897
A vile sorceress with
a mysterious, ancient grudge

23:55.974 --> 23:57.658
against Clan McDuck.

23:57.735 --> 23:59.805
She was Scrooge's
bitterest rival,

23:59.882 --> 24:01.602
but no one's seen her
since they fought

24:01.679 --> 24:04.280
on Mount Vesuvius
15 years ago.

24:04.357 --> 24:05.885
All right, all!
Cool heads!

24:05.962 --> 24:08.055
We must help Scrooge
before anything else...

24:11.551 --> 24:13.819
Take my brothers first,
please! Eee!

24:18.593 --> 24:21.389
- Oh.
- It's just Manny!

24:22.430 --> 24:26.063
That's it!
No more underwater labs!

24:26.140 --> 24:29.224
It's volcanoes or abandoned
castles from now on!

24:29.301 --> 24:30.951
Dr. Gearloose?!
What happened?!

24:31.028 --> 24:33.567
Our own shadows came
to life and wrecked the lab.

24:33.644 --> 24:36.074
Buh... my Shadow Control Ray
is still in the test phase,

24:36.151 --> 24:38.045
so this one is not on me.

24:38.122 --> 24:39.683
Everybody listen up!

24:44.563 --> 24:45.810
What?!

24:45.887 --> 24:47.299
Did anyone get
any of that?

24:47.376 --> 24:49.392
- It's mostly context clues.
- We get, like, every third word.

24:49.469 --> 24:50.962
Nope,
completely unintelligible.

24:51.039 --> 24:52.756
I'll show you
unintelligible!

24:52.833 --> 24:55.108
Ah! I don't have time
for this.

24:55.381 --> 24:56.991
The Barksian Modulator!

24:57.068 --> 25:00.324
Able to translate neural impulses
into sonic transmissions.

25:00.401 --> 25:01.396
Buh?

25:01.473 --> 25:02.894
It's a voice box.

25:02.971 --> 25:03.971
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, good idea.

25:04.048 --> 25:05.586
- What took you so long?
- Barksian Modulator.

25:05.663 --> 25:06.661
Buh.

25:11.612 --> 25:14.546
Hands offa me... ...you mad scientist!

25:15.497 --> 25:19.163
Whoa. He sounds
so normal.

25:19.364 --> 25:21.162
Rubber
baby buggy bumpers.

25:21.239 --> 25:23.518
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.

25:23.595 --> 25:25.649
Wow, never been able
to say that before.

25:25.726 --> 25:26.692
Ahem!

25:26.801 --> 25:29.387
As I was saying,
Uncle Scrooge is in trouble,

25:29.464 --> 25:31.165
and it's up
to us to help him.

25:31.242 --> 25:32.994
Adventure is in our blood.

25:33.071 --> 25:36.732
We face down perilous foes
and endless danger every day,

25:36.809 --> 25:38.174
but we always prevail.

25:38.251 --> 25:41.607
Because these Ducks
don't back down!

25:41.684 --> 25:43.580
Thank you, Donald.
Now, we need to...

25:43.657 --> 25:45.772
Stage a coordinated attack!

25:46.137 --> 25:48.238
Gyro, you and your team
will charge the bridge

25:48.315 --> 25:49.935
to distract
Magica's shadow forces.

25:51.555 --> 25:53.050
Launchpad,
head up the air attack

25:53.127 --> 25:54.160
to draw her attention.

25:54.237 --> 25:56.175
Do you think
you can crash into the Bin?

25:59.686 --> 26:01.334
All right, all right,
all right.

26:01.411 --> 26:03.685
And, Beakley, while
the others distract Magica,

26:03.762 --> 26:05.316
you and I will sneak
around back

26:05.393 --> 26:07.347
in my newly
fixed-up houseboat.

26:07.424 --> 26:11.421
That is actually very close
to what I was going to say.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.676
And we...

26:13.792 --> 26:16.804
Will stay here
and out of danger.

26:16.881 --> 26:17.998
- Oh, come on!
- But...

26:18.075 --> 26:19.285
This isn't an adventure.

26:19.362 --> 26:21.122
This is Magica DeSpell.

26:21.199 --> 26:24.596
Under no circumstances are
you kids to come to the Bin.

26:24.673 --> 26:25.880
Do you understand?

26:25.957 --> 26:28.323
- Yes, Uncle Donald.
- Yes, Donald.

26:35.430 --> 26:37.867
So we're totally sneaking
into the Money Bin, right?

26:37.944 --> 26:40.537
But how are we gonna take
on an entire shadow army?

26:40.614 --> 26:42.560
The Ducks don't back down!

26:42.637 --> 26:45.775
Now if only we knew someone with
experience breaking into places.

26:45.852 --> 26:47.835
You mean like
a noble teen ne'er-do-well

26:47.912 --> 26:50.380
who can break into anything,
including your heart?

26:50.457 --> 26:52.552
Yeah, that'd be great.

26:54.715 --> 26:55.952
- Lena!
- It's Lena!

26:56.029 --> 26:58.644
Lena, right! I was
gonna say Lena. Great.

26:58.753 --> 27:02.079
All right. Just like when I led
that uprising in Eagleslavia.

27:02.156 --> 27:03.523
I'll take the wheel, you...

27:03.600 --> 27:05.375
Uh-uh.
My house, my rules.

27:05.452 --> 27:07.357
Aye, aye... sir?

27:07.962 --> 27:10.064
Get ready for the storm.

27:11.992 --> 27:13.865
I am the storm.

27:14.230 --> 27:16.464
Seriously,
have you been saying things

27:16.541 --> 27:18.239
like that this whole time?

27:20.605 --> 27:22.833
Ah, best seat in the house.

27:22.910 --> 27:26.943
Now, the revenge monologue
I've been plotting for 15 years.

27:27.292 --> 27:29.742
"To my most hated nemesis..."

27:29.819 --> 27:31.184
That's you.

27:31.261 --> 27:33.664
"As you know, you banished me
to a nether-realm

27:33.741 --> 27:34.768
within your Dime,

27:34.845 --> 27:36.466
where I've been
biding my time,

27:36.543 --> 27:38.438
devising
your delicious downfall.

27:38.515 --> 27:39.825
In conclusion..."

27:39.902 --> 27:41.352
Wait. These are out of order.

27:41.429 --> 27:42.870
Hold on. Hold on!

27:42.947 --> 27:45.153
Don't roll
your eye at me!

27:45.230 --> 27:47.143
I've been trapped
for 15 years!

27:47.220 --> 27:49.806
I'm entitled
to a full minute of gloating!

27:49.883 --> 27:51.377
I will make you watch

27:51.454 --> 27:53.877
as I destroy everything
you've ever loved,

27:53.954 --> 27:56.795
starting with
your precious little town!

27:57.017 --> 27:59.154
Ooh, that's good.
Got a pen?

27:59.925 --> 28:02.031
- Lena?
- Yo, Lena!

28:02.108 --> 28:03.810
Where are you?!

28:04.218 --> 28:06.689
Oh, what if my best friend
was taken by the shadows?!

28:06.766 --> 28:07.914
Webby, don't lose faith.

28:07.991 --> 28:10.615
Remember,
Ducks don't back...

28:10.757 --> 28:12.004
down?

28:16.339 --> 28:20.051
Tonight we seek revenge
on those who destroyed our lab.

28:20.128 --> 28:22.073
And whoever defeats
the most shadows

28:22.150 --> 28:26.137
will earn the most elusive prize
of all... my respect.

28:26.214 --> 28:28.529
Oh, and the loser is fired.
Good luck!

28:36.635 --> 28:38.437
Pilot to co-pilot.
We are ready for launch.

28:38.514 --> 28:41.013
Could be dangerous.
Suggested flight path?

28:42.256 --> 28:44.993
<i>Let's get dangerous.</i>

28:53.362 --> 28:55.724
Is this
where Lena lives?

28:55.801 --> 28:58.272
Buh! Explains why she's always
sleeping over at our house.

28:58.349 --> 29:01.305
Lena? Sorry
to barge in unannounced!

29:01.382 --> 29:03.068
Maybe she's hiding?

29:03.589 --> 29:05.214
A journal!

29:07.548 --> 29:09.440
You can't read
her journal!

29:09.517 --> 29:10.674
Although if she were taken,

29:10.751 --> 29:12.232
she might have
left a note.

29:12.636 --> 29:13.742
A poem!

29:13.850 --> 29:16.262
Best friend, rebel, poet.

29:16.339 --> 29:18.716
Is there anything
Lena can't do?

29:19.360 --> 29:20.566
Ahem.

29:20.685 --> 29:23.235
"To end the line
of Clan McDuck,

29:23.312 --> 29:25.868
<i>she sought a token
of their luck.</i>

29:25.945 --> 29:28.669
<i>Lo, with the eclipse
in its prime,</i>

29:28.746 --> 29:32.007
<i>she'd trap old Scrooge
within his dime"?</i>

29:32.323 --> 29:35.244
<i>"But Scrooge reversed
her vengeance planned,</i>

29:35.321 --> 29:38.546
<i>and in his Dime,
the witch did land.</i>

29:38.636 --> 29:41.492
<i>Yet as he struck
the final blow,</i>

29:41.569 --> 29:45.115
<i>she cast a spy
from her shadow.</i>

29:45.300 --> 29:48.291
<i>I walk the earth
and wield her power</i>

29:48.368 --> 29:52.201
<i>to bring about
McDuck's last hour."</i>

29:57.657 --> 29:59.068
Lena is Magica's spy?!

29:59.145 --> 30:00.691
Lena is a shadow?!

30:00.768 --> 30:03.404
She betrayed us all
to free Magica.

30:03.566 --> 30:05.731
She was never my friend.

30:06.127 --> 30:08.711
You might not have her,
but you still have us.

30:08.788 --> 30:10.830
We're family,
and Ducks don't...

30:10.907 --> 30:13.076
- Save it.
- Aah!

30:14.288 --> 30:15.873
Uh, guys, check this out!

30:15.950 --> 30:17.693
Magica used
the power of the eclipse

30:17.770 --> 30:19.352
to escape Scrooge's Dime!

30:19.429 --> 30:20.930
Only to trap him
there instead!

30:21.007 --> 30:23.357
We have to get to that Dime
and save Scrooge ourselves!

30:23.434 --> 30:26.282
And I know
just how to Dewey it.

30:26.452 --> 30:28.998
Is this
your favorite treasure?

30:29.075 --> 30:31.732
Oh, too bad.
Now it's ice cream!

30:31.811 --> 30:33.141
Want a lick?

30:33.218 --> 30:34.437
Whoops!

30:34.514 --> 30:37.782
How does it feel, Scroogie?

30:39.856 --> 30:43.926
Oh! Looks like
your family's coming to play.

30:44.003 --> 30:46.826
Say goodbye, McDuck.

30:46.903 --> 30:48.985
Ha ha ha ha!

30:49.062 --> 30:50.061
Fore!

30:51.552 --> 30:52.757
Homerun!

30:55.038 --> 30:57.288
Tennis thing!

30:58.225 --> 30:59.984
Sports!

31:30.091 --> 31:32.157
Look what I found!

31:32.785 --> 31:34.820
What?!
We like Scrooge again!

31:34.897 --> 31:36.803
Whatever,
get your own Khopesh.

31:36.880 --> 31:38.022
Elevator's busted.

31:38.099 --> 31:40.767
How are we gonna get to the Bin
entrance on the top floor?

31:42.812 --> 31:44.203
Uhhhh!

31:46.107 --> 31:49.043
Sorry to crash the party!

31:53.869 --> 31:56.767
Sorry to crash the party!

31:59.386 --> 32:02.183
Crash. The. Par...

32:02.260 --> 32:04.681
Hey! Not cool!

32:10.464 --> 32:11.955
Aah!

32:12.123 --> 32:15.243
You'll never
take me alive!

32:15.327 --> 32:17.271
Wait, no.
Please take me alive!

32:18.973 --> 32:22.469
At last! One of
Scrooge's beloved nephew...

32:22.546 --> 32:23.576
Wait, who are you?

32:23.653 --> 32:25.733
I'm Scrooge's
number one scientist.

32:25.810 --> 32:27.795
Blink once if this guy
is a good friend,

32:27.872 --> 32:29.978
twice if he's just
a work acquaintance.

32:31.097 --> 32:33.139
- Aw...
- Bah!

32:33.216 --> 32:34.374
Ohh!

32:45.039 --> 32:47.087
No! Not now!

32:52.454 --> 32:54.285
We've gotta get to the Bin!

32:55.283 --> 32:56.899
You go! I'll be fine!

32:56.976 --> 32:59.691
Haven't had a proper
fight in a while anyway.

33:02.929 --> 33:05.144
Look after my boat!

33:06.687 --> 33:08.925
If Donald can keep
this bucket afloat,

33:09.002 --> 33:10.486
how hard could it be?

33:13.961 --> 33:16.855
Hey! What's the big idea?!

33:28.676 --> 33:30.762
Aw, phooey.

33:32.446 --> 33:33.646
So close.

33:37.049 --> 33:39.152
Louie. Out.

33:39.677 --> 33:42.579
Umm, guys, when did
our shadows come back?

33:44.195 --> 33:45.672
Yaah-aah!

33:45.749 --> 33:48.426
Cut the lights
so we won't cast shadows!

33:53.564 --> 33:55.340
Now we can't see!

33:55.439 --> 33:56.864
I can.

33:56.941 --> 33:59.524
Everyone hold hands and
form a chain behind Webby!

33:59.601 --> 34:00.854
Uh...

34:00.931 --> 34:03.871
Ew, Huey! Your hands are clammy!

34:06.046 --> 34:08.772
Come on, guys!
Ducks don't back down.

34:08.849 --> 34:11.045
I've literally never heard
that family motto before today!

34:11.121 --> 34:14.137
Ugh. We're never going to
find Scrooge's office!

34:16.389 --> 34:18.492
I found Scrooge's office!

34:22.033 --> 34:23.737
Okay, maybe we should
have listened to...

34:23.813 --> 34:26.018
- Aah!
- Uncle Donald?!

34:27.089 --> 34:29.304
Get away from my kids.

34:34.360 --> 34:35.764
Ha ha ha ha ha!

34:37.152 --> 34:38.152
Rrrr!

34:38.400 --> 34:40.176
We can explain!

34:40.407 --> 34:42.147
Please. I told you
not to come,

34:42.224 --> 34:43.346
so of course
you showed up.

34:43.422 --> 34:44.524
And just when I need you.

34:44.601 --> 34:46.072
Classic reverse psychology.

34:46.150 --> 34:48.058
Feel like I should've
seen that coming.

34:52.197 --> 34:53.362
Go save your uncle.

34:53.438 --> 34:55.696
I'll keep
these palookas at bay.

34:55.773 --> 34:58.251
Ducks don't back down.

34:58.328 --> 35:00.425
See? I told you
it's a thing!

35:00.502 --> 35:02.105
It's cooler
when he does it.

35:04.263 --> 35:07.600
Come and get it,
ya no good... Raah!

35:14.415 --> 35:15.788
Unh!

35:16.512 --> 35:18.176
Ooh! Look.

35:18.285 --> 35:20.153
Children.

35:27.795 --> 35:30.374
Looking for this?

35:31.332 --> 35:33.131
Come and get it.

35:36.875 --> 35:38.778
Give us back our uncle!

35:38.855 --> 35:42.499
Oh, he's trapped forever
inside the thing he loves most.

35:42.938 --> 35:44.278
Sorry.

35:45.279 --> 35:46.816
- Split up!
- Then what?!

35:46.893 --> 35:50.389
Do what we do best:
make trouble!

35:50.684 --> 35:52.254
Take that! And that!

35:52.331 --> 35:53.777
And... Hey! Ow! Wait!

35:53.854 --> 35:56.349
Oh! Hey!

35:56.426 --> 35:58.152
Hey!

35:58.723 --> 36:01.126
Who's... ... next?

36:04.761 --> 36:05.894
Aaah!

36:13.761 --> 36:15.845
Blathering Blatherskite!

36:17.079 --> 36:18.568
Illumination, gentlemen!

36:18.645 --> 36:20.299
If we increase
Li'l Bulb's wattage output

36:20.376 --> 36:22.513
and optimize the laser's
spatial coherence...

36:22.590 --> 36:23.824
Yes!

36:24.706 --> 36:26.490
Manny! We ride!

36:31.081 --> 36:32.382
Oh.

36:32.459 --> 36:33.783
He fixed the boat once,

36:33.860 --> 36:35.383
he can do it again, right?

36:37.803 --> 36:39.621
Ugh! Yah!

36:39.909 --> 36:41.597
Waah!

36:43.637 --> 36:45.841
Crash. The. Party!

36:47.207 --> 36:48.474
Huh?

36:51.078 --> 36:53.637
Oh, come on!
I'm the best at crashing!

36:53.714 --> 36:55.384
Wait!
Take the wheel!

36:55.461 --> 36:57.107
<i>Let's get dangerous!</i>

36:57.184 --> 36:59.221
<i>♪ Launchpad climbs
out on the plane ♪</i>

36:59.298 --> 37:01.536
<i>♪ Gonna start a fight ♪</i>

37:01.613 --> 37:03.838
<i>♪ Wish I could think
of a word ♪</i>

37:03.915 --> 37:05.647
<i>♪ That would rhyme with fight ♪</i>

37:05.724 --> 37:06.812
All right!

37:08.019 --> 37:10.213
- Hey, couple of questions for you.
- Aah! Gah!

37:10.290 --> 37:11.391
If you were caught
in the dime,

37:11.468 --> 37:13.006
how come we never
saw you in it? Oh!

37:13.083 --> 37:14.459
Also, Scrooge isn't
exactly magical,

37:14.536 --> 37:16.559
so how did he manage
to trap you in it? Aah!

37:16.636 --> 37:17.626
- Follow up.
- Aah!

37:17.703 --> 37:19.453
How does the lunar eclipse
factor into all this?

37:19.530 --> 37:21.506
Well, you see,
I channel my power...

37:21.605 --> 37:23.768
It's just magic, okay?!

37:23.845 --> 37:25.312
Hey! Ah! Ho ho!

37:26.747 --> 37:29.416
Oh, no! You broke
the Mirror of Tyche!

37:29.493 --> 37:30.520
The what now?

37:30.597 --> 37:31.541
Ancient artifact?

37:31.618 --> 37:33.276
Terrible curse
if you break it?

37:33.353 --> 37:36.559
I've never heard of it, and
I am versed in all magicks...

37:36.636 --> 37:40.123
Gaelic,
Demogorgan, Sumerian...

37:40.275 --> 37:43.155
Sumerian? You were
in that dime a long time.

37:43.592 --> 37:45.123
Well,
good luck with the curse!

37:45.206 --> 37:46.740
What kind of curse?

37:46.817 --> 37:49.960
Grave misfortune!
Increased gullibility!

37:50.037 --> 37:51.688
A swift kick in the ribs!

37:51.765 --> 37:52.820
- A what?
- Aagh!

37:52.897 --> 37:54.287
Aah! My ribs!

37:56.402 --> 37:57.613
Rrrr!

37:57.690 --> 37:59.834
Ooh. Someone's mad.

38:02.409 --> 38:03.700
Uh! Yah!

38:03.817 --> 38:05.802
I just got a family!

38:05.975 --> 38:08.314
I thought I had
a best friend in Lena!

38:08.391 --> 38:11.818
Yah! But you took that all away!
Unh!

38:12.081 --> 38:13.803
Aah!

38:14.228 --> 38:15.345
Yah!

38:16.043 --> 38:19.800
You are not.
A. Nice. Person!

38:21.207 --> 38:24.428
Aah!

38:28.342 --> 38:29.504
Ha!

38:31.203 --> 38:32.614
Ohh!

38:34.414 --> 38:36.379
Lena couldn't be
your friend,

38:36.456 --> 38:39.993
because
she was never real!

38:40.070 --> 38:41.928
I don't believe you.

38:42.005 --> 38:43.246
Huh!

38:44.733 --> 38:45.827
Aah!

38:47.494 --> 38:49.586
You had sleepovers
with a shadow.

38:49.663 --> 38:51.288
You gave it
a friendship bracelet!

38:51.365 --> 38:53.636
Honestly, it's embarrassing
how pathetic you were.

38:53.713 --> 38:56.438
Here, let me put you
out of your misery!

38:58.773 --> 39:00.097
What?

39:00.210 --> 39:02.283
Huh?

39:08.724 --> 39:10.764
Get away from
my best friend,

39:10.841 --> 39:12.173
Aunt Magica!

39:12.250 --> 39:14.444
- Lena?!
- Aunt?!

39:14.521 --> 39:15.894
You're even worse
than her!

39:15.971 --> 39:17.191
You aren't my family!

39:17.268 --> 39:19.379
You are nothing!

39:19.456 --> 39:20.810
Aaah!

39:20.887 --> 39:22.270
Nooo!

39:22.496 --> 39:24.511
Rraaaah!

39:28.502 --> 39:30.665
Come on, you...

39:30.742 --> 39:32.172
- Got it!
- Hey!

39:32.442 --> 39:33.467
Waah!

39:34.641 --> 39:36.214
So, listen, Uncle Scrooge,

39:36.291 --> 39:38.626
I guess I get why you
didn't tell us about our mom.

39:38.703 --> 39:41.550
And maybe we should've realized
that when we lost our mom,

39:41.627 --> 39:43.250
you lost her, too.

39:43.327 --> 39:44.774
But... Gah!

39:44.851 --> 39:46.722
Okay, not the time
for a heart-to-heart!

39:46.799 --> 39:48.577
Aah! Whoa-ho!

39:48.654 --> 39:49.684
Huh!

39:50.660 --> 39:52.069
That's mine!

39:54.661 --> 39:57.064
- Yah!
- Ohhh!

40:01.073 --> 40:02.531
Huh?

40:05.327 --> 40:07.619
Yaah!

40:07.845 --> 40:09.491
Thanks, lad!

40:10.681 --> 40:13.850
Way to dispel
yer own spell, DeSpell.

40:14.448 --> 40:15.539
Yaah!

40:15.616 --> 40:17.528
Raah! Yah!

40:17.817 --> 40:20.069
You know,
I ought to thank you.

40:20.168 --> 40:23.092
For showing you how weak
and pathetic you truly are?

40:23.169 --> 40:24.386
You're welcome.

40:24.463 --> 40:25.951
If you hadn't attacked me,

40:26.028 --> 40:28.155
my family may well
have left forever.

40:28.232 --> 40:29.628
By trying to destroy me,

40:29.705 --> 40:32.365
you sort of saved
my family.

40:32.442 --> 40:34.009
That's not what happened!

40:34.734 --> 40:35.850
Aah!

40:37.910 --> 40:38.964
Huh? Huh?

40:39.041 --> 40:40.448
I got it! Oh!

40:40.525 --> 40:41.653
Hey!

40:50.306 --> 40:54.045
Aaaah!

40:57.098 --> 40:58.323
Huh?

41:01.201 --> 41:04.064
Mm! My powers! They're gone!

41:04.141 --> 41:07.165
You ruin everything!

41:07.427 --> 41:08.643
Aaah!

41:08.732 --> 41:11.094
Sorry to crash the party!

41:11.171 --> 41:13.008
Huh!

41:14.350 --> 41:17.313
Huh. Never crashed
a me before.

41:17.390 --> 41:19.380
Ooh!

41:23.006 --> 41:24.731
Curse you, McDuck!

41:24.808 --> 41:28.039
You haven't seen
the last of me!

41:31.992 --> 41:33.333
Good show!

41:33.410 --> 41:34.497
Oh, boy!

41:34.574 --> 41:36.333
Whoo-hoo! We did it!

41:36.410 --> 41:39.401
We sure did.
Now about your boat...

41:39.478 --> 41:41.258
Ha ha! Yeah!

41:43.334 --> 41:45.969
Lena's... gone.

41:46.172 --> 41:49.311
But she sacrificed
herself to save you.

41:49.388 --> 41:52.889
Huh. I guess she really
was my best friend.

41:52.966 --> 41:55.055
She'll always be with you.

42:05.621 --> 42:09.656
Huey. Louie. The third one.

42:12.014 --> 42:15.551
Curse me kilts,
have I missed you.

42:19.506 --> 42:21.661
Family
truly is the greatest...

42:24.678 --> 42:26.450
- Eww!
- Blech!

42:28.863 --> 42:32.091
Anyone up
for a midnight swim?

42:38.592 --> 42:40.176
Aw. Bleh!

42:40.253 --> 42:42.078
Don't drink this water!

42:50.020 --> 42:52.163
<i>And so Duckburg is saved,</i>

42:52.240 --> 42:55.530
<i>thanks to Scrooge McDuck
and his family.</i>

42:58.712 --> 43:00.223
Boys?
