ON PURPOSE,

I WAS LOSING
WITH JURY TRIALS
'CAUSE I SWEAT.

00:25.258 --> 00:27.360
IS IT A GOOD SIGN
THAT THEY CAME BACK
THIS QUICK?

00:27.427 --> 00:29.663
IT'S A VERY GOOD SIGN
IF WE WIN,

00:29.730 --> 00:31.064
BUT NOT IF WE LOSE.

00:31.131 --> 00:32.698
WE FIND FOR THE PLAINTIFF

00:32.766 --> 00:35.235
AND ORDER THE DEFENDANT

00:35.301 --> 00:36.503
IN THE AMOUNT OF $82,000.

00:36.570 --> 00:37.738
I WON!

00:37.804 --> 00:38.972

SHE HAD EPISODES.

09:42.083 --> 09:45.186
SHE THOUGHT IT WAS
A DEMONIC POSSESSION
OF SOME SORT.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.220
DID YOU?

09:46.287 --> 09:47.589
NOT REALLY,

09:47.655 --> 09:50.925
BUT SHE WAS
SO DESPERATE
TO DO SOMETHING,

09:50.992 --> 09:53.795
AND SHE BELIEVED
IN EXORCISM.

09:53.861 --> 09:56.931
I THOUGHT THAT,
PSYCHOLOGICALLY,

09:56.998 --> 09:59.367
IT COULD BE A KIND
OF PLACEBO.

10:00.668 --> 10:01.669
ALL RIGHT.

10:01.736 --> 10:04.238
TELL ME EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.

10:06.741 --> 10:09.944
I HAD HER STRAPPED
TO THE TABLE.

10:10.011 --> 10:12.013
I WAS PRAYING
AGGRESSIVELY

10:12.079 --> 10:16.551
AND DEMANDING
IN THE NAME
OF GOD THAT...

10:16.618 --> 10:18.720
SATAN RID HIMSELF
OF HER BODY,

10:18.786 --> 10:21.222
AND SHE STARTED
TO JERK A LITTLE.

10:21.289 --> 10:21.956
JERK? HOW?

10:22.023 --> 10:24.125
LIKE A SMALL
CONVULSION,

10:24.191 --> 10:26.728
AND SHE
STARTED SCREAMING
OBSCENITIES.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.796
IT WAS LIKELY
A SCHIZOPHRENIC
EPISODE,

10:28.863 --> 10:32.334
AND THAT'S WHEN
I BROUGHT MY HAND
DOWN ON HER CHE--

10:36.571 --> 10:38.240
ON HER CHEST.

10:41.876 --> 10:43.845
SHE STARTED GASPING...

10:45.847 --> 10:47.048
TURNING BLUE.

10:47.114 --> 10:50.752
I COULD SEE SHE
WASN'T GETTING
ANY AIR.

10:50.818 --> 10:54.389
SO I TRIED
MOUTH-TO-MOUTH,
BUT--

10:54.456 --> 10:55.990
DID ANYBODY ELSE
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

10:56.057 --> 10:59.227
NO. SHE WAS
ADAMANT THAT IT
BE KEPT SECRET,

10:59.294 --> 11:02.964
BUT BY CANON LAW,
I HAD TO TELL
ARCHBISHOP MAZONEY

11:03.030 --> 11:04.999
TO GET
HIS PERMISSION.

11:05.066 --> 11:05.833
SO HE KNEW?

11:05.900 --> 11:08.670
HE DENIED PERMISSION.

11:09.637 --> 11:11.206
WE HAD AN ARGUMENT.

11:11.273 --> 11:15.677
I TOLD HIM
I WAS MAYBE GONNA
TRY IT ANYWAY.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.612
SO YOU DID THIS
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

11:17.679 --> 11:20.081
OH, BOBBY...

11:20.148 --> 11:23.618
THIS WOMAN HAD
BEEN IN MY PARISH
FOR 20 YEARS.

11:23.685 --> 11:25.920
I COULDN'T SIT BACK

11:25.987 --> 11:29.224
AND LET HER
DETERIORATE
ANYMORE.

11:29.291 --> 11:33.595
SHE EVEN HAD HER
PSYCHIATRIST TRY...

11:33.661 --> 11:36.030
EXPERIMENTAL DRUGS.

11:37.432 --> 11:39.134
SHE WAS
THAT DESPERATE.

11:40.835 --> 11:42.770
I TRIED TO HELP HER.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.710
INSTEAD, MAYBE
I KILL--KILLED HER.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.712
YOU DIDN'T KILL HER.

11:52.847 --> 11:55.650
ALL RIGHT,
LISTEN TO ME.

11:55.717 --> 11:58.720
THIS IS
YOUR STATEMENT.

11:58.786 --> 12:01.456
I CAN'T REVEAL
THE CONTEXT OF THE MEETING.

12:01.523 --> 12:03.591
UH, PRIEST-PARISHIONER.

12:03.658 --> 12:06.061
AND IT WAS DURING
THE MEETING SHE HAD
THE HEART ATTACK?

12:06.128 --> 12:07.662
YES.

12:07.729 --> 12:09.097
WAS THE MEETING
UPSETTING HER?

12:09.164 --> 12:10.832
WAS SHE WORKED UP
ABOUT SOMETHING?

12:10.898 --> 12:12.367
SHE'S A SCHIZOPHRENIC,

12:12.434 --> 12:15.070
AND SHE MAY HAVE BEEN
HAVING AN EPISODE.

12:15.137 --> 12:17.739
THAT DOESN'T REVEAL
THE NATURE OF WHAT
THE MEETING WAS ABOUT.

12:17.805 --> 12:18.906
IT'S OK.

12:21.576 --> 12:23.445
AND, UH,
WHEN SHE WENT DOWN,

12:23.511 --> 12:24.579
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:24.646 --> 12:26.281
I DID MOUTH-TO-MOUTH.

12:26.348 --> 12:29.384
THEN CHEST COMPRESSIONS,
AND WHEN SHE DIDN'T RESPOND,

12:29.451 --> 12:30.585
HE CALLED 911.

12:30.652 --> 12:33.121
NO, I DIDN'T DO
CHEST COMPRESSIONS.

12:33.188 --> 12:35.257
I JUST DID
MOUTH-TO-MOUTH.

12:38.726 --> 12:39.961
OK.

12:41.463 --> 12:42.364
ANYTHING ELSE?

12:42.430 --> 12:44.399
NO.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.737
THANK YOU, FATHER.

12:49.804 --> 12:51.873
I KNOW, UNDER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES--

12:51.939 --> 12:54.642
WELL, WE APPRECIATE
YOUR COOPERATION.

12:54.709 --> 12:56.611
SURE.

12:56.678 --> 12:58.546
MY CONDOLENCES.

13:10.258 --> 13:12.094
WELL, THIS
IS QUITE A DAY.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.762
FIRST,
I KILL SOMEBODY,
THEN I LIE.

13:14.829 --> 13:15.998
WHAT A WONDERFUL
PRIEST I AM.

13:16.064 --> 13:18.333
YOU DIDN'T KILL HER,
AND YOU DIDN'T LIE.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.968
DO YOU THINK WE SENT
THAT OFFICER OUT

13:20.035 --> 13:21.436
WITH
THE RIGHT IMPRESSION
OF WHAT HAPPENED?

13:21.503 --> 13:22.570
IT'S TRUE.

13:22.637 --> 13:24.907
YOU CAN'T REVEAL
PRIEST-PARISHIONER
COMMUNICATIONS.

13:24.973 --> 13:26.942
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT
CHEST COMPRESSIONS?

13:27.009 --> 13:30.212
LOOK, FATHER, YOU'RE
IN A LITTLE DEEP HERE.

13:30.278 --> 13:32.047
IF THIS INFORMATION
GETS OUT THE WRONG WAY,

13:32.114 --> 13:33.681
YOU COULD LOSE YOUR CHURCH.

13:33.748 --> 13:36.784
YOU COULD BE EXPOSED
TO NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS
AND CRIMINAL,

13:36.851 --> 13:38.086
YOU COULD GO UP
ON MANSLAUGHTER.

13:38.153 --> 13:40.088
LET ME DO
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

13:42.857 --> 13:44.192
OK.

13:46.261 --> 13:48.263
I'M GOING TO GET YOU
THROUGH THIS.

13:52.367 --> 13:54.536
YOU REMEMBER
WHEN MY MOTHER DIED?

13:54.602 --> 13:56.204
MMM.

13:56.271 --> 13:59.374
HOW YOU GOT ME
THROUGH IT?

13:59.441 --> 14:01.944
WELL...

14:02.010 --> 14:04.279
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

14:04.346 --> 14:06.614
I'M GOING TO PULL YOU
THROUGH THIS.

14:16.558 --> 14:18.026
DON'T MOVE.

14:18.093 --> 14:20.495
EITHER ONE
OF YOU.

14:26.768 --> 14:29.337
IF I HEARD CORRECTLY,

14:29.404 --> 14:31.139
YOU'RE HERE TO GET
A COURT ORDER

14:31.206 --> 14:34.742
TO ALLOW YOUR CLIENT
TO REMOVE A TUBE
FROM HIS CLIENT'S--

14:34.810 --> 14:37.412
WE'RE SEEKING
DECLARATORY RELIEF.

14:37.479 --> 14:39.314
IF MY CLIENT CONCLUDES
THIS PROCEDURE AGAINST
HIS CLIENT'S WILL,

14:39.381 --> 14:40.983
IT COULD BE CONSTRUED
AS BATTERY.

14:41.049 --> 14:43.786
ALSO, THERE ARE SERIOUS
MITIGATION ISSUES.

14:43.852 --> 14:47.555
AND AS WE STAND HERE,
YOUR CLIENT REMAINS
IN HIS CLIENT'S OFFICE

14:47.622 --> 14:48.623
WITH THE TUBE STILL--

14:48.690 --> 14:52.060
THAT'S CORRECT,
YOUR HONOR.

14:55.497 --> 14:59.067
THERE ARE CERTAIN SITUATIONS
WHERE THE COURT IS LOATH
TO INTERVENE.

14:59.134 --> 15:01.469
PARENTING WOULD BE
SUCH A SITUATION.

15:01.536 --> 15:04.940
CONSENSUAL RELATIONS
BETWEEN MARRIED COUPLES.

15:05.007 --> 15:08.110
PROCTOLOGICAL EXAMS.

15:08.176 --> 15:12.047
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GET ANOTHER DOCTOR?

15:12.114 --> 15:14.282
IT'S NOT QUITE
THAT SIMPLE.

15:14.349 --> 15:16.318
OH, IT ISN'T?

15:16.384 --> 15:19.154
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GETTING
ANY COURT ORDER FROM ME.

15:24.626 --> 15:26.094
THIS IS PERVERSE.

15:26.161 --> 15:27.830
I GOTTA SEE THE BODY.
THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE.

15:27.896 --> 15:30.098
WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO SEE THE BODY?

15:30.165 --> 15:31.599
LISTEN, IF SHE'S
GOT A SERIOUS BRUISE,

15:31.667 --> 15:33.635
THIS'LL GO TO THE POLICE
BEFORE AN AUTOPSY.

15:33.702 --> 15:35.137
I DON'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.842
THE M.E. HASN'T EVEN
LOOKED AT THE BODY.

15:39.908 --> 15:41.043
I REALLY SHOULDN'T
BE DOING THIS.

15:41.109 --> 15:42.444
Bobby: I KNOW.

15:42.510 --> 15:44.046
I UNDERSTAND.

15:44.112 --> 15:45.347
IT'S JUST
THAT ALICE KENNEDY

15:45.413 --> 15:46.649
WAS IN FATHER MARTIN'S
PARISH FOR 20 YEARS.

15:46.715 --> 15:48.216
HE'S SUPPOSED
TO DO THE BLESSING
FOR THE DEAD.

15:48.283 --> 15:49.584
LET'S JUST MAKE
THIS QUICK, PLEASE?

15:49.652 --> 15:51.553
Ellenor: WE REALLY
APPRECIATE THIS, MAGGIE.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.101
ALMIGHTY AND ETERNAL GOD,

16:06.168 --> 16:09.004
HEAR OUR PRAYERS
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER ALICE

16:09.071 --> 16:12.708
WHOM YOU HAVE CALLED
FROM THIS LIFE TO YOURSELF.

16:16.144 --> 16:18.346
GRANT HER LIGHT,
HAPPINESS, AND PEACE.

16:20.515 --> 16:22.985
LET HER PASS IN SAFETY
THROUGH THE GATES OF DEATH

16:23.051 --> 16:26.154
AND LIVE FOREVER
WITH ALL YOUR SAINTS

16:26.221 --> 16:27.856
IN THE LIGHT
YOU PROMISED TO ABRAHAM

16:27.923 --> 16:31.560
AND TO ALL
HIS DESCENDANTS IN FAITH.

16:31.627 --> 16:32.595
AMEN.

16:34.763 --> 16:35.964
THOSE ARE
FROM THE STRAPS.

16:36.031 --> 16:39.167
I HAD HER STRAPPED
TO THE TABLE.

16:39.234 --> 16:42.571
OK, UH, ELLENOR,
I WANT YOU TO FIND
DR. BARRY JACOB.

16:42.638 --> 16:44.472
HE'S THE PSYCHIATRIST
WHO TREATED HER
FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA.

16:44.540 --> 16:45.541
WE GOT NO RELEASE.

16:45.608 --> 16:47.075
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU CRACK HIM
ON THE PRIVILEGE,

16:47.142 --> 16:48.176
BUT YOU GOT TO TRY.

16:48.243 --> 16:49.812
I GOTTA HAVE SOME IDEA
HE'LL SUBSTANTIATE.

16:49.878 --> 16:51.013
WILL THEY
DO AN AUTOPSY?

16:51.079 --> 16:53.115
THEY HAVE TO BY LAW.
SHE WAS UNDER 55.

16:53.181 --> 16:54.483
YEAH,
BUT THAT'S GOING
TO TAKE SOME TIME.

16:54.550 --> 16:55.551
I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT
THE EXTERNAL MARKS.

16:55.618 --> 16:57.686
THERE WAS SOME SLIGHT
BRUISING ON HER CHEST.

16:57.753 --> 16:58.921
WE'RE ON THE CLOCK NOW.

16:58.987 --> 17:00.723
WE HAVE TO GO
TO THE POLICE BEFORE
THEY GET WIND OF ANYTHING.

17:00.789 --> 17:01.790
WHY?

17:01.857 --> 17:03.225
I WANT TO BE PREEMPTIVE

17:03.291 --> 17:04.827
AND GIVE THEM ANSWERS BEFORE
THEY START ASKING QUESTIONS.

17:04.893 --> 17:05.694
THAT'LL HELP
OUR CREDIBILITY,

17:05.761 --> 17:07.295
BUT FIRST WE GOT TO GET
OUR DUCKS LINED UP.

17:07.362 --> 17:09.964
THAT MEANS A CONFIRMATION
FROM THE DOCTOR

17:10.031 --> 17:11.934
THAT THE LADY
FELT POSSESSED BY DEMONS.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.435
WE ALSO NEED
THE SUPPORT OF THE CHURCH.

17:13.502 --> 17:15.503
THEY HAVE TO SAY
THAT YOU ARE A PRIEST
BEYOND REPROACH.

17:15.570 --> 17:16.371
WILL THEY DO THAT?

17:16.439 --> 17:18.140
NO, THEY'LL CUT ME OFF
AS A ROGUE PRIEST.

17:18.205 --> 17:19.541
THAT CANNOT HAPPEN.

17:19.608 --> 17:21.743
THEY HAVE TO BE
FULLY BEHIND US.

17:21.810 --> 17:24.847
I WANT TO MAKE THIS
AN EASY CALL FOR THE POLICE.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.714
REBECCA, I NEED A MEETING

17:26.781 --> 17:28.383
WITH COUNSEL FOR
THE ARCHDIOCESE OF BOSTON.

17:28.451 --> 17:30.352
I NEED IT
WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR.

17:30.419 --> 17:31.820
LET THEM KNOW IT'S URGENT.

17:31.887 --> 17:32.655
IS LINDSAY THERE?

17:32.721 --> 17:34.122
YEAH.

17:34.189 --> 17:35.323
RIGHT HERE.

17:35.390 --> 17:37.292
CALL IN KENNY TRIPP.
TELL HIM I NEED A FAVOR.

17:37.359 --> 17:39.361
WELL,
DON'T TAKE ANY FLAP.

17:39.428 --> 17:41.063
YOU TELL HIM I WANT HIS ASS
IN MY OFFICE NOW.

17:41.129 --> 17:43.098
BOBBY, I DON'T LIKE
THE SOUND OF YOUR VOICE.

17:43.165 --> 17:46.535
WE HAVE TO SNUFF THIS OUT
BEFORE THEY GET STARTED.

17:53.075 --> 17:54.276
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:54.342 --> 17:57.413
UH, JUST LAWYER STUFF.
THE STUFF THAT LAWYERS DO.

17:57.480 --> 17:58.414
EXCUSE ME?

17:58.481 --> 17:59.515
EXCUSED.

18:04.487 --> 18:06.622
THERE'S NO REASON
FOR A STENOGRAPHER.

18:06.689 --> 18:08.757
THERE MOST CERTAINLY IS.
I WANT A TRANSCRIPT.

18:08.824 --> 18:10.158
I WANT IT RECORDED
THAT YOUR CLIENT
PREVENTED MY CLIENT

18:10.225 --> 18:11.694
FROM COMPLETING
THIS PROCEDURE.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.597
LOOK, MR. PARKS,
THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
IT CAN BE TOO COMFORTABLE.

18:14.663 --> 18:16.031
WHY NOT JUST HAVE HIM
TAKE IT OUT, SO--

18:16.098 --> 18:17.600
NO!

18:17.666 --> 18:19.935
MR. PARKS, YOU COULD
GET AN INFECTION WITH
THAT THING UP THERE.

18:20.002 --> 18:21.637
NO! YOU'RE NOT COMING
NEAR ME, NIMROD.

18:21.704 --> 18:22.671
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

18:22.738 --> 18:23.939
YOU KEEP TALKING.
GET A PROCTOLOGIST
IN HERE.

18:24.006 --> 18:26.375
YOU'RE JUST
ADDING ZEROES TO
MY DEFAMATION CLAIM.

18:26.442 --> 18:28.010
DEFAMATION?! YOU GOT ME
WIRED FOR CABLE HERE!

18:28.076 --> 18:29.812
FOR GOD'S SAKE,
THIS IS YOUR PHYSICAL!

18:29.878 --> 18:31.547
QUIET!
YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS!

18:31.614 --> 18:33.549
ALL RIGHT,
I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK
ON THE RECORD NOW,

18:33.616 --> 18:36.452
AND I WILL THANK YOU
FOR NOT INTERRUPTING ME
IN ADVANCE.

18:36.519 --> 18:37.586
THANK YOU.

18:39.054 --> 18:40.323
NOW...

18:40.389 --> 18:43.359
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY ACTIONS
BROUGHT BY MR. PARKS

18:43.426 --> 18:45.661
BY MY CLIENT'S ALLEGED
FAILURE TO INFORM,

18:45.728 --> 18:47.963
AN ALLEGATION MY CLIENT
CATEGORICALLY DENIES,

18:48.030 --> 18:51.467
ANY AND ALL COMPLICATIONS
RESULTING FROM THE FAILURE
TO COMPLETE THIS PROCEDURE,

18:51.534 --> 18:53.902
ANY AND ALL COMPLICATIONS
OR INFECTIONS

18:53.969 --> 18:56.739
RESULTING
FROM THE SIGMOIDOSCOPE
BEING KEPT IN PLACE,

18:56.805 --> 19:00.376
SAID COMPLICATIONS WILL
NOT BE THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF DR. WALSH,

19:00.443 --> 19:02.645
GIVEN MR. PARKS'
DUTY TO MITIGATE.

19:02.711 --> 19:04.647
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT APPOINTMENTS.

19:04.713 --> 19:06.515
YOU TELL HIM
THERE'S A POTENTIAL
MILLION DOLLAR LAWSUIT

19:06.582 --> 19:08.417
ABOUT TO EXPLODE
IN THE ARCHBISHOP'S FACE.

19:08.484 --> 19:11.387
I'M TAKING 20 MINUTES
OF HIS TIME NOW.

19:11.454 --> 19:13.256
I'LL BE IN HIS OFFICE
IN 10 SECONDS.

19:14.490 --> 19:16.425
I CAN'T GIVE YOU
THAT KIND
OF INFORMATION.

19:16.492 --> 19:19.495
I UNDERSTAND THE POSITION
I'M PUTTING YOU IN.

19:19.562 --> 19:21.764
WELL FOR SOMEONE
WHO UNDERSTANDS IT,
YOU'RE NOT VERY TACTFUL.

19:21.830 --> 19:25.568
YOU BARGE IN HERE,
ANNOUNCE THAT ONE
OF MY PATIENTS IS DEAD,

19:25.634 --> 19:27.670
AND BEFORE I EVEN
HAVE TIME TO GULP,

19:27.736 --> 19:29.905
YOU'RE ASKING
FOR HER MEDICAL RECORDS.

19:29.972 --> 19:32.308
YOU KNOW, AS A LAWYER,
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
UNDERSTAND PRIVILEGE.

19:32.375 --> 19:35.311
NOT TO BE OVERLY
INSENSITIVE, DOCTOR,

19:35.378 --> 19:38.046
BUT I DON'T THINK PRIVILEGE
SURVIVES THE PATIENT.

19:38.113 --> 19:40.349
I MUST ASK YOU
TO LEAVE, MISS FRUTT.

19:40.416 --> 19:43.719
DR. JACOB,
THIS IS AN EXTREMELY
DELICATE SITUATION.

19:43.786 --> 19:45.788
CAN I PLEASE SPEAK
TO YOU IN CONFIDENCE?

19:45.854 --> 19:48.557
WELL, I SUPPOSE
THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT
YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAY.

19:48.624 --> 19:53.929
ALICE KENNEDY DIED
WHILE HER PRIEST WAS
PERFORMING AN EXORCISM.

19:53.996 --> 19:55.598
WHAT?

19:55.664 --> 19:57.533
ACCORDING
TO FATHER MARTIN,

19:57.600 --> 19:59.935
SHE CLAIMED
THAT SHE WAS POSSESSED
BY DEMONIC SPIRITS.

20:00.002 --> 20:03.639
WE UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU DIAGNOSED
HER SCHIZOPHRENIA,

20:03.706 --> 20:05.374
AND WE ALSO SUSPECT
THAT SHE TOLD YOU
OF HER PARANOIA

20:05.441 --> 20:06.809
THAT SHE WAS POSSESSED.

20:06.875 --> 20:10.846
I'M NOT ASKING
FOR ANY DISCLOSURE
OF SPECIFIC TREATMENT.

20:10.913 --> 20:13.549
I JUST NEED YOU TO CONFIRM
THESE 2 THINGS--

20:13.616 --> 20:15.384
THAT SHE DID SUFFER
FROM SCHIZOPHRENIA

20:15.451 --> 20:17.653
AND THAT SHE TOLD YOU
THAT SHE WAS POSSESSED.

20:17.720 --> 20:21.056
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO DISCUSS
ANY TREATMENT.

20:21.124 --> 20:22.558
NOW, YOU KNOW
THAT IF--

20:22.625 --> 20:25.228
PLEASE, THE POLICE
ARE LIKELY TO SUBPOENA
YOUR RECORDS ANYWAY.

20:25.294 --> 20:28.030
I'M HOPING IT DOESN'T
COME TO THAT.

20:28.097 --> 20:30.799
ESPECIALLY SINCE I'M TOLD
YOU USED EXPERIMENTAL DRUGS
ON HER ONCE,

20:30.866 --> 20:33.769
AND I'M SURE
THAT WOULDN'T HELP YOU
PUBLIC RELATIONS-WISE.

20:33.836 --> 20:35.504
IS THAT A THREAT?

20:37.540 --> 20:39.142
I'M JUST TRYING
TO HELP A GOOD PRIEST

20:39.208 --> 20:41.877
AVOID SOME NEGATIVE
PUBLICITY OF HIS OWN.

20:48.517 --> 20:51.054
MY RECORDS WILL BEAR OUT
HER SCHIZOPHRENIA

20:51.120 --> 20:53.256
AS WELL AS
HER DEMONIC PARANOIA.

20:54.423 --> 20:56.025
THAT'S ALL I'LL SAY.

21:03.599 --> 21:05.734
AND YOUR
FIRST CONSULTATION...

21:05.801 --> 21:06.869
ABSOLUTELY FREE.

21:06.935 --> 21:08.571
AFTER THAT...

21:08.637 --> 21:10.273
IF YOU DON'T MAKE MONEY,

21:10.339 --> 21:11.740
THEN WE DON'T GET PAID.

21:11.807 --> 21:13.142
CUT!

21:13.209 --> 21:14.210
JIMMY...

21:14.277 --> 21:17.946
JIMMY, JIMMY,
JIMMY, JIMMY...OK.

21:18.014 --> 21:20.116
POINT TO YOURSELF
ON "WE"

21:20.183 --> 21:22.385
AND THE CAMERA
ON "YOU," OK?

21:22.451 --> 21:24.453
GO WATCH
ON THE MONITOR.
I'LL SHOW YOU.

21:27.356 --> 21:31.127
YOU MOVE ACROSS
THE FRONT OF THE DESK...

21:31.194 --> 21:33.062
IF YOU DON'T MAKE MONEY,

21:33.129 --> 21:35.031
WE DON'T GET PAID.

21:35.098 --> 21:36.632
YOU END UP HERE,

21:36.699 --> 21:40.603
AT WHICH POINT,
YOU CASUALLY LEAN ON
THE CORNER OF THE DESK.

21:40.669 --> 21:41.470
OK?

21:41.537 --> 21:43.139
OK, NOW COME HERE.

21:43.206 --> 21:45.374
NOW, JUST TRY--
TRY AND RELAX, OK?

21:45.441 --> 21:47.944
HEY! WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

21:48.011 --> 21:49.712
KENNY,
CONFERENCE ROOM.

21:49.778 --> 21:51.147
WHAT, YOU'RE MAKING
A MOVIE HERE?

21:51.214 --> 21:52.248
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO.

21:52.315 --> 21:53.282
QUIET, PLEASE.

21:53.349 --> 21:55.384
UH, HE'S NOT
ON THE MARK.

21:56.852 --> 21:57.921
HEY, REBECCA.

21:57.987 --> 21:59.322
NEVER MIND HER.

21:59.388 --> 22:00.856
LOOK AT ME.

22:00.924 --> 22:03.492
THE COP THAT TOOK
A BULLET ON HANOVER
LAST WEEK,

22:03.559 --> 22:05.561
BOBBY THINKS YOU
MIGHT HAVE A CLUE
AS TO WHO SHOT HIM.

22:05.628 --> 22:07.030
FIRST OF ALL,
WHY WOULD I KNOW?

22:07.096 --> 22:09.165
'CAUSE YOU KNOW
EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON
IN THE NORTH END.

22:09.232 --> 22:11.767
AND SECOND, DO I
LOOK LIKE A SNITCH,
OR IS IT SOMETHING--

22:11.834 --> 22:14.270
BOBBY'S GOT ONE
IN THE FAVOR BANK.
HE'S CALLING THE CHIP.

22:14.337 --> 22:16.805
THE CHIP? THE CHIP?

22:16.873 --> 22:20.143
LOOK, IN 2 WEEKS, I START
A 6-MONTH PRISON TERM,

22:20.209 --> 22:21.277
THANKS TO YOU.

22:21.344 --> 22:22.811
YOU WANNA SEE MY CHIP?

22:22.879 --> 22:25.849
YOU'RE ANONYMOUS.
YOUR NAME WILL NEVER
BE MENTIONED.

22:25.915 --> 22:29.085
IF I HAD ANYTHING
TO SHOP, DON'T YOU THINK
I'D BE SHOPPING IT?

22:29.152 --> 22:30.586
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T CARE.

22:30.653 --> 22:32.421
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THE FAVOR YOU OWE
IS ALL ABOUT.

22:32.488 --> 22:35.925
ALL I DO KNOW IS BOBBY
SAID FOR ME TO TELL YOU
HE'S CALLING IN THE FAVOR.

22:35.992 --> 22:38.494
HE NEEDS A NAME, A LEAD,
OR ANY INFORMATION

22:38.561 --> 22:40.529
THE POLICE
WOULD BE GLAD TO GET.

22:40.596 --> 22:42.832
BOBBY MIGHT NEED
TO TRADE SOMETHING IN.

22:42.899 --> 22:45.168
AND HE THINKS
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
WHO CAN GET IT.

22:45.234 --> 22:46.735
AND AS LONG AS
I'VE KNOWN BOBBY,

22:46.803 --> 22:48.972
I'VE NEVER HEARD HIM
SO DEAD SERIOUS.

22:51.340 --> 22:52.976
GET TO WORK, KENNY.

22:56.412 --> 22:57.580
GO!

22:59.282 --> 23:02.051
WE NEVER AUTHORIZED
ANY EXORCISM.

23:02.118 --> 23:05.321
I KNOW THAT.
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO SAY THAT.

23:05.388 --> 23:06.489
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING?

23:06.555 --> 23:08.091
THAT YOU BACK FATHER MARTIN,

23:08.157 --> 23:10.659
THAT YOU CONFIRM
THAT HE CAME TO YOU
FOR PERMISSION,

23:10.726 --> 23:13.029
THAT HE'S A RESPECTED
AND RESPECTABLE PRIEST.

23:13.096 --> 23:17.066
FIRST OF ALL, THE CATHOLIC
CHURCH PROHIBITS EXORCISMS
ON MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE.

23:17.133 --> 23:18.367
I KNOW THAT.
I'M ASKING--

23:18.434 --> 23:20.069
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
ASKING, COUNSEL.

23:20.136 --> 23:21.470
YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR COVER,

23:21.537 --> 23:23.206
AND I'M HERE
TO TELL YOU

23:23.272 --> 23:25.174
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO FIND IT HERE.

23:25.241 --> 23:26.542
NOW, AS FAR AS
WE'RE CONCERNED

23:26.609 --> 23:28.211
AND <i>ON</i> THE RECORD,

23:28.277 --> 23:30.513
MAYBE HE SHOULD BE
INVESTIGATED.

23:30.579 --> 23:32.048
NOW WHO'S LOOKING
FOR COVER?

23:32.115 --> 23:36.452
MR. DONNELL,
CERTAINLY YOU CAN
APPRECIATE OUR POSITION.

23:36.519 --> 23:39.322
IF WE IN ANY WAY
ENDORSE FATHER MARTIN,

23:39.388 --> 23:41.424
WE EXPOSE OURSELVES
TO ENORMOUS LIABILITY.

23:41.490 --> 23:43.559
I'M TRYING TO HELP
INSULATE YOU BY--

23:43.626 --> 23:45.661
DON'T INSULT OUR
INTELLIGENCE, PLEASE.

23:45.729 --> 23:49.532
YOUR ONLY MISSION HERE
IS WIGGLING YOUR CLIENT
OFF A HOOK.

23:49.598 --> 23:51.000
SAME AS YOUR MISSION,
COUNSEL.

23:51.067 --> 23:53.436
IT'S JUST DIFFERENT CLIENTS
AND DIFFERENT HOOKS.

23:53.502 --> 23:55.972
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT'S GONNA GO DOWN
IF YOU DON'T BACK ME.

23:56.039 --> 23:58.975
DON'T TURN AWAY!

23:59.042 --> 24:01.444
I'M SAYING THIS ONCE.

24:01.510 --> 24:04.648
IT'S FATHER MARTIN'S BELIEF
THE ARCHBISHOP
HAD REASON TO KNOW

24:04.714 --> 24:08.484
HE WAS GOING
TO DO IT ANYWAY,
EVEN WITHOUT PERMISSION.

24:08.551 --> 24:09.886
THAT ISN'T TRUE.

24:09.953 --> 24:12.488
YOUR WORD, HIS WORD,
QUESTION FOR A JURY.

24:12.555 --> 24:15.291
IF YOU HAD ANY HINT,
YOU COULD BE NEGLIGENT
FOR FAILING TO SUPERVISE.

24:15.358 --> 24:16.660
OH! GET A LAW DEGREE.

24:16.726 --> 24:18.227
A WOMAN DIED HERE!

24:18.294 --> 24:22.766
AND THERE IS ONLY
ONE DEEP POCKET,
AND THAT IS THE CHURCH.

24:22.832 --> 24:25.501
AT THIS MOMENT, WE
HAVE A VERY SMALL WINDOW.

24:25.568 --> 24:26.970
THE CASE COULD GET CLOSED,

24:27.036 --> 24:30.039
HEART ATTACK OR A WIDER
INVESTIGATION COULD ENSUE,

24:30.106 --> 24:31.908
A CHARGE COULD FILE.

24:31.975 --> 24:33.910
ONCE THAT HAPPENS,
PANDORA'S GOT WINGS.

24:33.977 --> 24:35.544
WE WILL NOT SUPPORT
HIS DOING THAT EXORCISM.

24:35.612 --> 24:37.914
DON'T! BUT WHEN
A DETECTIVE CALLS,

24:37.981 --> 24:41.651
I NEED YOU TO VOUCH
FOR FATHER MARTIN.

24:41.718 --> 24:42.686
IF YOU HANG HIM OUT,
IT'S A FREE-FOR-ALL.

24:42.752 --> 24:44.220
YOU'RE EXTORTING US.

24:44.287 --> 24:45.221
LOOK...

24:46.389 --> 24:49.325
LOOK, YOU KNOW
FATHER MARTIN WELL.

24:49.392 --> 24:52.495
DO YOU THINK HE
WOULD'VE HURT THIS WOMAN
INTENTIONALLY?

24:53.997 --> 24:54.864
NO.

24:54.931 --> 24:57.400
WELL, THAT'S ALL
I'M ASKING YOU TO SAY,

24:57.466 --> 25:00.169
JUST DO IT EMPHATICALLY.

25:00.236 --> 25:02.505
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO EXTORT
THE TRUTH OUT OF YOU.

25:02.572 --> 25:04.908
AND LET'S ALL FACE IT.
IF HE GETS CHARGED,

25:04.974 --> 25:06.475
IT IS <i>BAD</i> FOR THE CHURCH.

25:06.543 --> 25:09.979
ROGUE OR NOT, HE IS
STILL ONE OF YOURS.

25:16.553 --> 25:19.455
I NEED TO TALK THIS OVER
WITH MY CLIENT.

25:19.523 --> 25:20.990
THE CLOCK IS TICKING,
HALF-HOUR.

25:26.863 --> 25:28.465
M, LITTLE C, K-R-E-W.

25:28.532 --> 25:30.500
HE'S IN THE HOMICIDE
DIVISION. TRY FOR 3:30.

25:30.567 --> 25:31.801
AND WHAT IF HE CAN'T?

25:31.868 --> 25:33.870
HE HAS TO. IN FACT,
GET HIM ON THE LINE.
I'LL TALK TO HIM.

25:33.937 --> 25:36.039
WHEW. WHERE
THE HELL IS KENNY?

25:36.105 --> 25:38.241
WE LIT THE FIRE
AS BEST WE COULD.

25:38.307 --> 25:39.709
ANY WORD
FROM THE CORONER?

25:39.776 --> 25:41.545
NOT YET.
I THINK I SHOULD JUST GO
TO THE POLICE NOW.

25:41.611 --> 25:42.979
NO, NO, NO.
WE'RE NOT READY YET.

25:43.046 --> 25:44.481
THIS FEELS LIKE
SOME SORDID CONSPIRACY.

25:44.548 --> 25:45.882
WE'RE NOT READY YET.

25:45.949 --> 25:48.351
I HIT THAT WOMAN. MAYBE
I DIDN'T CAUSE HER DEATH,

25:48.417 --> 25:50.854
BUT I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
DOING THE EXORCISM
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.422
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME
HERE.

25:52.489 --> 25:55.058
BOBBY, MIKE McKREW ON 3.

26:02.065 --> 26:04.434
MIKE. HEY.

26:04.501 --> 26:06.202
NOT BAD. HOW 'BOUT YOU?

26:07.370 --> 26:09.005
HOW'S SUZY?

26:09.072 --> 26:10.940
GREAT.

26:11.007 --> 26:14.043
YEAH, YEAH. STILL
LOOKING TO MEET THE FUTURE
EX-MRS. DONNELL.

26:14.110 --> 26:15.244
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

26:15.311 --> 26:19.048
LISTEN, MIKE, I GOT A KIND
OF A SENSITIVE SITUATION

26:19.115 --> 26:22.051
I'D LIKE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT IN PERSON.

26:22.118 --> 26:26.456
NO. NOTHING BAD.
JUST SOME INFORMATION
I THINK YOU'D WANT TO HAVE.

26:26.523 --> 26:29.959
CAN I COME DOWN THERE
THIS AFTERNOON,
MAYBE 3:00, 3:30?

26:30.026 --> 26:33.162
OH, THANKS.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

26:33.229 --> 26:35.031
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

26:36.165 --> 26:37.100
OK, BUDDY.

26:37.166 --> 26:41.204
GET THE CHURCH ON THE LINE.
THEIR HALF-HOUR'S UP.

26:43.573 --> 26:45.074
JEEZ, THIS MUST
BE DESPERATE.

26:45.141 --> 26:46.443
THAT A REAL PRIEST?

26:46.510 --> 26:47.877
WHO SHOT THAT COP?

26:47.944 --> 26:49.813
I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO FIND OUT.

26:49.879 --> 26:51.548
WHO SHOT THAT COP?!

26:51.615 --> 26:52.649
I SWEAR I DON'T KNOW.

26:52.716 --> 26:54.784
TELL ME SOMETHING
YOU DO KNOW.
TELL ME NOW.

26:54.851 --> 26:56.520
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING DOWN HERE?

26:56.586 --> 26:59.356
I'LL FILL YOU IN LATER.
FOR NOW, IT'S JUST LIKE
OLD TIMES.

26:59.423 --> 27:01.991
YOU TRUST ME.
I NEED SOMETHING IN CASE
THE COPS WANT SOMETHING

27:02.058 --> 27:04.794
IN RETURN FOR WHAT
I'M ASKING OF THEM.
GIVE ME SOMETHING.

27:04.861 --> 27:05.995
TICK, TICK, TOCK.

27:08.598 --> 27:11.134
THEY HAVE SOME DIRTY HELP
IN NARCOTICS.

27:11.200 --> 27:14.237
THEY'RE STAKING OUT
DAISY'S FOLD 'N' FLUFF
ON PRINCE STREET

27:14.304 --> 27:17.974
'CAUSE SOME STUFF
HAS BEEN KNOWN TO PASS
WITH THE WHITER LINENS.

27:18.041 --> 27:20.644
NOTHING'S GONNA
GET FOUND AT DAISY'S.

27:20.710 --> 27:23.146
THEIR INFORMANT
TALKS OUTTA BOTH SIDES.

27:23.212 --> 27:25.415
FIRST NAME'S WARREN.
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

27:25.482 --> 27:27.284
YOU KNOW MORE.
NO, I DON'T.

27:27.351 --> 27:28.652
YOU DO.
I DON'T.

27:30.554 --> 27:31.921
ALL RIGHT, GO.

27:31.988 --> 27:33.089
NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.

27:33.156 --> 27:35.259
ALL WE NEED NOW
IS THE CHURCH.

27:35.325 --> 27:37.661
I GOT 'EM. I JUST GOT
OFF THE PHONE WITH RYERSON.

27:37.727 --> 27:40.029
THEY'LL VOUCH FOR YOU
BEING A GOOD PRIEST.

27:40.096 --> 27:42.266
THEY'LL CONFIRM THAT YOU
DID SEEK PERMISSION FIRST,

27:42.332 --> 27:45.702
BUT THEY'LL DENY
ANY KIND OF APPROVAL,
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.

27:45.769 --> 27:48.137
ALL RIGHT. SIT.

27:50.039 --> 27:51.708
LET'S TALK ABOUT EXORCISMS.

27:51.775 --> 27:54.077
GET JOEY BLAND IN HERE
WITH HIS EQUIPMENT.

27:54.143 --> 27:55.679
WE GOTTA GIVE YOU
A POLYGRAPH.

27:55.745 --> 27:56.713
A LIE DETECTOR?

27:56.780 --> 27:58.882
THE POLICE WILL PROBABLY
WANT TO GIVE YOU ONE.

27:58.948 --> 28:01.285
I'D LIKE TO SAY YES,
BUT I GOTTA BE SURE
YOU'LL PASS.

28:04.988 --> 28:06.856
Director: IT'S NOT
THAT DIFFICULT.

28:06.923 --> 28:08.592
IT IS WHEN YOU
MAKE ME NERVOUS.

28:08.658 --> 28:11.060
I JUST SAY JUST MOVE
NICE AND SMOOTH,

28:11.127 --> 28:13.463
SIT ON THE EDGE
OF THE DESK
AND TALK.

28:13.530 --> 28:17.234
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M
ASKING YOU TO CHEW
A STICK OF GUM.

28:17.301 --> 28:18.735
MAKEUP, BLOT HIM.

28:18.802 --> 28:21.671
I'M GIVING YOU
3 MORE TAKES,
AND THAT'S IT.

28:21.738 --> 28:23.273
SO, NOW RELAX, DAMN IT.

28:23.340 --> 28:26.376
YEAH, THREATEN ME.
THAT HELPS ME RELAX.

28:26.443 --> 28:28.044
OK. POSITION!

28:28.112 --> 28:29.379
SPEED!

28:29.446 --> 28:30.514
Man: WE HAVE SPEED.

28:30.580 --> 28:33.217
AND ACTION!

28:33.283 --> 28:35.652
HAVE YOU OR A LOVED ONE
BEEN INJURED?

28:35.719 --> 28:38.054
IF SO, YOU MAY HAVE RIGHTS.

28:38.122 --> 28:40.290
MY NAME IS JAMES BERLUTI.

28:40.357 --> 28:43.593
I'M AN ATTORNEY WHO SPECIALIZES
IN HELPING PEOPLE LIKE YOU

28:43.660 --> 28:46.029
RECEIVE THE COMPENSATION
THEY DESERVE

28:46.096 --> 28:49.133
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN VICTIMIZED
BY OTHER PEOPLE'S NEGLIGENCE.

28:49.199 --> 28:50.534
ANYBODY--UHH!

28:50.600 --> 28:51.835
CUT.

28:51.901 --> 28:53.070
Man: IT'S A CUT.

28:53.137 --> 28:54.438
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
THANKS.

28:57.941 --> 28:59.776
IS THIS WHAT
YOU PAGED ME FOR?

28:59.843 --> 29:02.879
PLEASE, JUST REMOVE
THE SCOPE AND GET HIM
OUT OF MY OFFICE.

29:02.946 --> 29:04.514
I AM NOT TREATING
THIS MAN.

29:04.581 --> 29:05.849
WHAT?

29:05.915 --> 29:07.284
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
MY INSURANCE COMPANY

29:07.351 --> 29:09.719
WOULD DROP ME
LIKE A STONE
IF I COME NEAR HIM.

29:09.786 --> 29:10.887
OH, DOCTOR--

29:10.954 --> 29:12.722
NO DOCTOR
WILL TOUCH HIM.

29:12.789 --> 29:14.158
YOU HAD TO KNOW
THAT, STEVE.

29:14.224 --> 29:16.426
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
HE WON'T LET ME.

29:16.493 --> 29:17.761
IT WOULD BE NEGLIGENCE
TO LEAVE THAT IN THERE.

29:17.827 --> 29:18.828
NOT MINE.

29:18.895 --> 29:19.896
TAKE IT OUT.

29:19.963 --> 29:21.131
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
WITHOUT HIS CONSENT,

29:21.198 --> 29:22.432
THAT'S CONSIDERED
BATTERY.

29:22.499 --> 29:25.902
DR. PANKIN, IF I GET
MY CLIENT TO SIGN A RELEASE,

29:25.969 --> 29:27.304
WAIVING ANY FUTURE CLAIMS--

29:27.371 --> 29:29.206
YOU CAN'T WAIVE NEGLIGENCE.
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT.

29:29.273 --> 29:31.508
I WON'T SUE!
I'M A REASONABLE MAN!

29:31.575 --> 29:32.776
RIGHT.

29:32.842 --> 29:34.444
YANK IT OUT.

29:34.511 --> 29:36.046
NO!
CONSENT!

29:36.113 --> 29:36.913
NO!

29:36.981 --> 29:39.383
WE GOT 2 LAWYERS,
2 DOCTORS,

29:39.449 --> 29:40.517
AND A, UH...

29:40.584 --> 29:41.585
ALUMINUM SIDING.

29:41.651 --> 29:42.919
A BUSINESSMAN HERE,

29:42.987 --> 29:44.754
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY
FIGHTING OVER

29:44.821 --> 29:46.790
WHAT WE'RE
FIGHTING OVER?

29:46.856 --> 29:47.992
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

29:49.459 --> 29:50.494
EUGENE YOUNG.

29:50.560 --> 29:53.063
DO YOU DO MEDICAL
MALPRACTICE WORK,
MR. YOUNG?

29:53.130 --> 29:53.931
SOME.

29:53.998 --> 29:55.933
SOME. WELL, I DO A LOT.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.502
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE I'M A DOCTOR.

29:58.568 --> 30:00.237
AND LIKE
WITH EVERY DOCTOR,

30:00.304 --> 30:02.306
MEDICAL
MALPRACTICE SUITS
ARE A WAY OF LIFE.

30:02.372 --> 30:06.276
YOU CAN GO YOUR
ENTIRE CAREER WITHOUT
MAKING A SINGLE MISTAKE

30:06.343 --> 30:09.346
AND STILL EXPECT
TO BE ROUTINELY SUED
5 TIMES A YEAR.

30:09.413 --> 30:11.515
THIS ISN'T THE FORUM
TO DISCUSS THAT.

30:11.581 --> 30:13.517
THIS IS
THE PERFECT FORUM.

30:13.583 --> 30:16.653
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS GUY.

30:16.720 --> 30:20.190
HE'S A POSTER BOY
FOR WHAT DRIVES UP
MALPRACTICE PREMIUMS,

30:20.257 --> 30:21.825
WHICH DRIVE UP
HEALTHCARE COST.

30:21.892 --> 30:23.460
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN HERE.

30:23.527 --> 30:24.561
PLEASE DO.

30:24.628 --> 30:26.163
MR. ALUMINUM SIDING HERE

30:26.230 --> 30:29.867
WILL FILE
HIS RIDICULOUS LAWSUIT,

30:29.934 --> 30:32.569
AND HIS INSURANCE COMPANY
WILL COME TO HIM AND ASK HIM
TO SIGN OFF ON A SETTLEMENT,

30:32.636 --> 30:35.239
BECAUSE SETTLING IS CHEAPER
THAN GOING TO TRIAL.

30:35.305 --> 30:39.343
AND IF HE SAYS TO THEM,
"NO, I DON'T WANT TO SETTLE,

30:39.409 --> 30:40.845
I DID NOTHING WRONG."

30:40.911 --> 30:43.747
HIS INSURANCE COMPANY
WILL DISCONTINUE COVERAGE.

30:43.813 --> 30:48.485
BECAUSE ON PRINCIPLE,
CARRIERS DON'T LIKE DOCTORS
THAT STICK ON PRINCIPLE.

30:50.587 --> 30:52.089
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.

30:53.623 --> 30:55.225
ARE YOU DONE?

30:55.292 --> 30:56.593
I'M DONE.

30:56.660 --> 30:59.796
GOOD, 'CAUSE ASIDE
FROM YOUR PROFOUND INSIDE
COMMENTARY ON HEALTHCARE,

30:59.864 --> 31:01.398
WHICH WE ALL ENJOYED,

31:01.465 --> 31:03.267
WE STILL GOT
A STUPID SITUATION HERE

31:03.333 --> 31:04.768
THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN
FIXED HOURS AGO.

31:04.835 --> 31:08.372
NOW, YOU ARE GOING
TO GIVE HIM AN
UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE.

31:08.438 --> 31:09.306
DOESN'T CHANGE--

31:09.373 --> 31:14.611
QUIET! YOU ARE GOING TO
AGREE TO INDEMNIFY HIM

31:14.678 --> 31:18.482
FOR ANY NEGLIGENCE CLAIM
FILED AGAINST HIM
BY HIM.

31:18.548 --> 31:23.353
AND, YOU, YOU ARE GOING
TO TAKE THAT THING
OUT OF THAT MAN'S ANUS,

31:23.420 --> 31:25.422
THEN MAYBE
WE CAN FIX MEDICARE.

31:28.425 --> 31:30.928
PULL OUT YOUR LEGAL PAD,
COUNSEL.

31:30.995 --> 31:32.496
LET'S START DRAFTING.

31:35.132 --> 31:37.167
YOU SPRINKLED HER
WITH HOLY WATER?

31:37.234 --> 31:38.002
YES.

31:38.068 --> 31:39.569
DID YOU HIT HER?

31:39.636 --> 31:41.105
YES.

31:41.171 --> 31:44.174
DID YOU INTEND
TO CAUSE HER
PHYSICAL HARM?

31:44.241 --> 31:45.209
NO.

31:45.275 --> 31:47.377
Bland:
ARE YOU JEWISH?

31:47.444 --> 31:49.013
NO.

31:49.079 --> 31:50.781
WERE YOU ATTEMPTING
TO HEAL ALICE KENNEDY?

31:50.848 --> 31:52.516
YES.

31:52.582 --> 31:53.450
HOW'S HE DOING?

31:53.517 --> 31:56.553
SO FAR, YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF
AN HONEST PRIEST.

31:58.255 --> 32:01.591
TROUBLE. YOU GOT
A LITTLE TIP FROM
THE CORONER'S OFFICE.

32:01.658 --> 32:03.293
THERE WAS
A PRETTY DECENT TRAUMA
TO THE CHEST.

32:03.360 --> 32:05.863
THEY'RE GONNA REPORT IT
TO THE POLICE.

32:05.930 --> 32:08.265
DAMN IT! THE CLOCK
JUST STRUCK MIDNIGHT.

32:08.332 --> 32:09.734
HE'LL PASS THEIR POLYGRAPH?

32:09.800 --> 32:10.668
WITH FLYING COLORS.

32:10.735 --> 32:12.202
LET'S GO.

32:12.269 --> 32:13.337
WHERE?

32:13.403 --> 32:14.705
TO THE POLICE.

32:21.278 --> 32:23.714
I GOT TO ADMIT,
YOU GOT ME CURIOUS.

32:23.781 --> 32:24.982
WHAT'S UP?

32:25.049 --> 32:27.284
10:00 THIS MORNING,
A WOMAN NAMED ALICE KENNEDY

32:27.351 --> 32:31.188
HAD A HEART ATTACK AND DIED
AT FATHER MARTIN'S CHURCH.

32:31.255 --> 32:32.990
ONE OF HIS PARISHIONERS.

32:33.057 --> 32:34.524
SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

32:34.591 --> 32:37.762
YEAH. AS FAR AS I KNOW,
IT'S JUST LISTED
AS A CORONARY,

32:37.828 --> 32:39.596
BUT IT WASN'T
QUITE THAT SIMPLE.

32:39.664 --> 32:42.166
YOU'LL FIND
A SLIGHT BRUISE
ON HER CHEST,

32:42.232 --> 32:45.369
AS WELL AS CHAFING MARKS
ON HER HANDS AND LEGS.

32:45.435 --> 32:48.238
AT THE TIME SHE WAS
HAVING THE HEART ATTACK,

32:48.305 --> 32:51.341
FATHER MARTIN WAS
PERFORMING AN EXORCISM.

32:53.210 --> 32:57.047
IT-IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A CONFESSIONAL SEAL.

32:57.114 --> 33:00.017
HE REALLY SHOULDN'T
DIVULGE THIS INFORMATION
ABOUT A PARISHIONER,

33:00.084 --> 33:04.421
BUT HE CAME TO ME,
AND I THOUGHT HE REALLY
SHOULD COME TO YOU.

33:04.488 --> 33:10.294
EXORCISM.
LIKE SPINNING HEAD
AND PEA SOUP?

33:10.360 --> 33:11.962
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN
LIKE THAT.

33:12.029 --> 33:13.898
IT'S MAINLY PRAYERS,
THE SIGN OF THE CROSS,

33:13.964 --> 33:17.201
LAYING HANDS ON
THE SUBJECT, HOLY WATER,
THAT KIND OF THING.

33:17.267 --> 33:19.737
THE REASON I DESCRIBED
THE SITUATION AS DELICATE,

33:19.804 --> 33:23.207
AS FATHER MARTIN
BROUGHT HIS HAND DOWN
ON ALICE KENNEDY'S CHEST,

33:23.273 --> 33:25.643
THAT'S WHEN SHE WENT
INTO ARREST.

33:25.710 --> 33:28.646
HE'S AFRAID HE MAY HAVE
PRECIPITATED IT.

33:32.550 --> 33:34.218
NOTARIZE, PLEASE.

33:35.152 --> 33:36.286
THANK YOU.

33:36.353 --> 33:37.187
SURE.

33:37.254 --> 33:39.089
NOW, THIS INCORPORATES
BY REFERENCE

33:39.156 --> 33:42.660
HIS RELEASE OF DR. PANKIN
AND IS AN AMENDMENT
FOR OUR RELEASE.

33:42.727 --> 33:43.528
NO PROBLEM.

33:43.594 --> 33:45.696
NO INDEMNIFICATION
FOR SUPERVENING ACTS.

33:45.763 --> 33:47.131
DON'T EVEN GO THERE.

33:47.197 --> 33:49.634
I NEED YOU TO
SIGN HERE, DOCTOR.

33:49.700 --> 33:50.635
OK?

33:50.701 --> 33:51.736
YES.

33:51.802 --> 33:53.604
AND YOU NEED
TO INITIAL HERE.

33:53.671 --> 33:56.240
MR. PARKS' HEALTHCARE
IS UNDER HIS COMPANY'S
PLAN,

33:56.306 --> 33:59.143
SO HE'S HERE AS
PRESIDENT OF ALUMINATED
DREAM SIDING.

33:59.209 --> 34:00.511
HE'S NOT PERSONALLY
EXPOSED.

34:00.578 --> 34:01.345
WHAT?

34:01.411 --> 34:02.880
NO. WE'LL INITIAL THAT,

34:02.947 --> 34:06.551
BUT I RESERVE THE RIGHT
TO PIERCE THE CORPORATE VEIL.

34:06.617 --> 34:08.553
FINE! LET'S DO IT.

34:16.060 --> 34:17.562
THIS WOMAN
WANTED AN EXORCISM?

34:17.628 --> 34:19.063
SHE BEGGED ME FOR IT.

34:19.129 --> 34:21.998
HERE IS THE PHONE NUMBER
OF DR. BARRY JACOB,

34:22.065 --> 34:23.434
HER TREATING
PSYCHIATRIST.

34:23.501 --> 34:25.069
HE'LL CONFIRM
THE WOMAN'S SCHIZOPHRENIA,

34:25.135 --> 34:28.938
AS WELL AS HER BELIEF
THAT SHE WAS THE VICTIM
OF SOME DEMONIC POSSESSION.

34:29.005 --> 34:31.942
HERE YOU'LL FIND
THE PHONE NUMBER OF
ARCHBISHOP JOHN MAZONEY,

34:32.009 --> 34:35.012
WHO FATHER MARTIN
WENT TO FOR PERMISSION
TO DO THE EXORCISM.

34:35.079 --> 34:36.481
THAT'S PURSUANT
TO CANON LAW.

34:36.547 --> 34:39.449
IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT
PERMISSION WAS DENIED.

34:39.516 --> 34:41.918
YOU DIDN'T GET PERMISSION
FROM THE CHURCH?

34:41.985 --> 34:44.922
NO. ARCHBISHOP MAZONEY
WASN'T CONVINCED
OF POSSESSION.

34:44.989 --> 34:48.458
HE THOUGHT IT WAS
PROBABLY MENTAL ILLNESS
OF SOME SORT.

34:48.525 --> 34:50.995
I MUST CONFESS,
HE WAS PROBABLY RIGHT.

34:51.061 --> 34:52.830
THEN WHY'D YOU DO IT?

34:52.897 --> 34:55.966
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
OF SOME BENEFIT,
AS A PLACEBO.

34:56.033 --> 34:57.568
SHE WAS DESPERATE,
DETECTIVE.

35:02.507 --> 35:05.510
BLOT HIM AGAIN.
HIS HEAD LOOKS LIKE
THE <i>VALDEZ.</i>

35:05.576 --> 35:08.979
I THOUGHT THE TALENT IS
SUPPOSED TO GET CODDLED
IN THIS BUSINESS.

35:09.046 --> 35:10.948
TALENT?
YOU FELL OFF A DESK.

35:11.015 --> 35:12.950
I NEVER MADE CONTACT.

35:13.017 --> 35:14.485
WE NEED THIS OFFICE BACK,
JIMMY.

35:14.552 --> 35:17.054
I'M NOT DONE. I WANT
TO GET IT RIGHT.

35:17.121 --> 35:18.323
HOW DO YOU GET
ONE OF THESE THINGS RIGHT?

35:18.389 --> 35:19.890
HEY, LINDSAY,
DO ME A FAVOR.

35:19.957 --> 35:22.760
LET ME DO WHAT
I WANT TO DO. OK?
IT DOESN'T AFFECT YOU.

35:22.827 --> 35:24.261
IT DOES AFFECT ME.

35:24.329 --> 35:26.196
DOING A COMMERCIAL, IT
EMBARRASSES THIS PLACE.

35:26.263 --> 35:27.632
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

35:27.698 --> 35:28.866
DON'T SWEAT.

35:28.933 --> 35:30.401
I'LL SWEAT IF I WANT TO.

35:30.468 --> 35:32.002
NOT EVERYBODY
WENT TO HARVARD.

35:32.069 --> 35:34.472
NOT EVERYBODY GETS
TO GET A LAWYER
WHO WENT TO HARVARD.

35:34.539 --> 35:36.140
THERE'S LITTLE PEOPLE
OUT THERE:

35:36.206 --> 35:37.975
HACKS WITH SMALL CLAIMS
THE SIZE OF A BLACKHEAD

35:38.042 --> 35:39.977
YOU'D GO RUNNING
TO YOUR DERMATOLOGIST
TO HAVE REMOVED.

35:40.044 --> 35:42.980
NICKEL-AND-DIME PEOPLE
LOOKING FOR
NICKEL-AND-DIME LAWYERS.

35:43.047 --> 35:45.983
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU
THAT YOU DON'T FIT
INTO THAT CATEGORY.

35:46.050 --> 35:47.252
I DO.

35:47.318 --> 35:50.087
AND I'M SELLING
WHAT I GOT TO SELL.

35:50.154 --> 35:52.390
FORGIVE ME
FOR EMBARRASSING YOU.

35:54.292 --> 35:56.160
CAN WE DO ONE MORE TAKE,
PLEASE?

35:56.227 --> 35:57.362
WHEN I'M READY.

35:57.428 --> 35:58.829
NO, NO.
YOU'RE READY NOW.

35:58.896 --> 36:00.298
I GOT A GREAT IDEA.

36:00.365 --> 36:01.732
YOU, OUT OF HERE.
EXCUSE ME.

36:01.799 --> 36:03.801
MAKEUP, BLOT HIM QUICKLY.
LET'S GO. OK.

36:07.738 --> 36:09.640
I'LL BE JUST A MINUTE.

36:11.676 --> 36:15.313
BOBBY, WHY DID HE
REMOVE THE STRAPS
FROM THE ROOM?

36:15.380 --> 36:16.914
HE WAS SCARED AT FIRST.

36:16.981 --> 36:20.451
LOOK, MIKE, HE'S
THE ONE WHO WANTED
TO COME FORWARD HERE.

36:20.518 --> 36:22.587
HE'S BEEN MY PRIEST
ALMOST MY WHOLE LIFE.

36:22.653 --> 36:25.190
STILL,
IF HIS HITTING HER
CAUSED THE HEART ATTACK,

36:25.256 --> 36:27.192
WE GOT TO PURSUE THIS.
YOU KNOW THAT.

36:27.258 --> 36:29.126
CALL THE SHRINK.
CALL THE ARCHBISHOP.

36:29.194 --> 36:30.661
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:30.728 --> 36:33.198
GIVE HIM A POLYGRAPH IF
IT'LL GIVE YOU PEACE OF MIND.

36:33.264 --> 36:35.200
THIS IS JUST
AN UNFORTUNATE RESULT.

36:35.266 --> 36:36.601
THERE WAS NOTHING
CRIMINAL HERE.

36:36.667 --> 36:38.136
YOUR INVESTIGATION'S
GONNA SHOW THAT.

36:38.203 --> 36:39.504
SO WHY THE BIG PUSH?

36:39.570 --> 36:43.107
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FILE A CHARGE
AND THEN INVESTIGATE.

36:43.174 --> 36:44.942
I WANT YOU TO CHECK
THINGS OUT FIRST,

36:45.009 --> 36:47.978
'CAUSE I KNOW THEN
NO CHARGE WOULD EVER BE FILED.

36:50.915 --> 36:51.849
MIKE...

36:55.386 --> 36:56.954
I NEED A FAVOR HERE, MAN.

37:00.591 --> 37:03.128
THIS GUY, HE'S DEAR TO ME.

37:03.194 --> 37:04.229
IT, UH...

37:04.295 --> 37:07.465
A SCANDAL WOULD JUST
COST HIM HIS PARISH.

37:08.433 --> 37:10.401
I JUST WANT
TO PUT THIS TO BED

37:10.468 --> 37:12.837
SO THE MEDIA DOESN'T
START HAVING ITS FUN.

37:21.046 --> 37:22.847
I DO WANT TO DO
A POLYGRAPH.

37:23.981 --> 37:25.516
NO PROBLEM.

37:26.984 --> 37:28.486
WAIT A MINUTE.

37:32.990 --> 37:34.492
AS FOR FAVORS,

37:34.559 --> 37:37.895
WHAT DO YOU GOT
FOR ME?

37:41.466 --> 37:43.334
YOU GOT SOME STINK
IN NARCOTICS.

37:43.401 --> 37:46.971
SNITCH NAMED WARREN'S
TIPPING OFF

37:47.038 --> 37:50.075
SOME FOLD 'N' FLUFF
YOU'RE STAKING OUT
FOR MOVING COKE.

37:50.141 --> 37:52.777
YOU NEVER HEARD IT
FROM ME.

37:56.714 --> 37:59.484
LET'S GO DO
THE POLYGRAPH.

38:07.892 --> 38:09.394
FROM YOUR FALL?

38:10.261 --> 38:11.496
I'LL LIVE.

38:14.899 --> 38:16.301
JIMMY, I'M SORRY.

38:16.367 --> 38:18.769
BOBBY SAYS
I GOT THIS COMPLEX

38:18.836 --> 38:21.739
THAT I WANT TO BE
THE LAW FIRM
ACROSS THE STREET.

38:21.806 --> 38:25.543
I REALLY AM SORRY
FOR SAYING WHAT I SAID.

38:27.778 --> 38:29.847
YOU CARRY YOUR WEIGHT
HERE, LINDSAY.

38:29.915 --> 38:32.117
SO FAR I DON'T.

38:32.183 --> 38:36.187
I JUST WANT TO BRING
SOMETHING TO THE TABLE.
THAT'S ALL.

38:36.254 --> 38:37.422
I KNOW.

38:41.826 --> 38:43.694
Director: OK.
I NEED QUIET ON THE SET.

38:43.761 --> 38:45.230
Man: WE'RE BACK.
LET'S GO.

38:45.296 --> 38:46.431
POSITION!

38:51.836 --> 38:54.339
I THOUGHT THESE THINGS
ONLY TOOK A MINUTE.

38:54.405 --> 38:56.441
MAYBE HE FOUND
SOMETHING MALIGNANT.

38:57.542 --> 38:59.444
AGAIN, AS A FREE
LEGAL TIP--

38:59.510 --> 39:01.046
HE WAS A REAL TROUPER.

39:01.112 --> 39:02.981
I'LL SEND YOU A BILL.

39:04.082 --> 39:05.851
HEY, DOC, ONE THING.

39:07.352 --> 39:08.753
I'LL TAKE THE HIT.

39:08.819 --> 39:10.856
ON PATIENTS
WHO SUE OVER NOTHING

39:10.922 --> 39:13.859
AND THE LAWYERS
WHO TAKE THEIR CASES,
I'LL OWN THE HIT.

39:13.925 --> 39:16.227
BUT IF DOCTORS
ARE LETTING INSURANCE
COMPANIES RUN MEDICINE,

39:16.294 --> 39:19.364
IT SEEMS TO ME
DOCTORS GOTTA OWN
A LITTLE BLAME, TOO.

39:19.430 --> 39:21.366
YOU JUST DON'T
GET IT, COUNSEL.

39:21.432 --> 39:23.734
MEDICINE USED
TO BE RUN BY BUSINESS.

39:23.802 --> 39:25.937
NOW MEDICINE
IS A BUSINESS.

39:26.004 --> 39:27.772
I FEEL LIKE A NEW MAN.

39:27.839 --> 39:30.275
I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT,
GROUNDHOG.

39:30.341 --> 39:31.376
MR. YOUNG.

39:31.442 --> 39:34.312
YOU DIDN'T HANDLE THIS
VERY WELL.

39:34.379 --> 39:36.882
I FELT YOU TWIST IT.

39:47.192 --> 39:48.493
HMM.

39:54.933 --> 39:56.067
YOU'RE OK.

39:56.134 --> 39:57.535
YOU PASSED THEIR POLYGRAPH.

39:57.602 --> 40:01.039
'LESS SOMETHING COMES UP,
WHICH THEY DON'T EXPECT,

40:01.106 --> 40:02.540
NOTHING'S GETTING FILED.

40:02.607 --> 40:06.044
CAUSE OF DEATH LISTED
AS HEART ATTACK. PERIOD.

40:06.111 --> 40:08.046
OH, THANK GOD FOR THAT.

40:08.113 --> 40:11.116
THE CHEST BRUISE WAS MINIMAL,
THEY TALKED TO THE ARCHBISHOP,

40:11.182 --> 40:14.853
HER DOCTOR, AND HER SISTER,
WHO ALSO CONFIRMED SHE WAS
BEGGING YOU FOR HELP.

40:17.989 --> 40:19.124
YOU'RE OK.

40:19.190 --> 40:20.625
GOOD.

40:24.062 --> 40:25.030
GOOD.

40:29.567 --> 40:30.669
WHAT'S WRONG?

40:32.470 --> 40:34.673
IT'S BEEN QUITE A DAY.

40:37.208 --> 40:39.544
A PARISHIONER OF MINE DIED.

40:40.912 --> 40:42.513
EVERYTHING'S BEEN SPINNING
SO FAST.

40:42.580 --> 40:45.917
I GUESS I'M JUST A LITTLE
OVERWHELMED BY IT ALL.

40:47.185 --> 40:49.655
IS THAT IT?
ANYTHING ELSE?

40:51.256 --> 40:52.190
THAT'S ALL.

40:52.257 --> 40:54.325
Berluti:
I GOT IT. RIGHT HERE.

40:54.392 --> 40:56.294
ROUGH CUT.
CAN I USE YOUR TV?

40:56.361 --> 40:57.663
SHE SAYS
IT CAME OUT GOOD.

40:57.729 --> 41:00.265
30 SECONDS,
IT GOES QUICK.

41:00.331 --> 41:02.300
LET ME SPARE THE FATHER.

41:02.367 --> 41:04.435
COME ON,
I'LL WALK YOU OUT.

41:04.502 --> 41:05.671
WE'LL WAIT.

41:08.339 --> 41:09.474
THANK YOU.

41:17.348 --> 41:18.383
BOBBY.

41:18.449 --> 41:21.653
HEY, EUGENE.
WHERE YOU BEEN ALL DAY?

41:21.720 --> 41:24.289
DOCTOR'S OFFICE.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

41:24.355 --> 41:25.924
BUSY.

41:25.991 --> 41:27.492
UH-HUH.

41:31.630 --> 41:32.931
THANK YOU.

41:32.998 --> 41:34.566
AGAIN.

41:36.668 --> 41:38.036
WHAT'S WRONG?

41:41.406 --> 41:44.275
DON'T MISUNDERSTAND.

41:44.342 --> 41:48.413
WITHOUT YOU, I COULD BE
FACING MANSLAUGHTER CHARGES.

41:48.479 --> 41:50.348
I WOULD'VE LOST MY PARISH
FOR SURE.

41:50.415 --> 41:52.450
AND PROBABLY MY LIFE.

41:52.518 --> 41:54.686
BUT?

41:54.753 --> 41:58.223
BUT WHAT WE DID TODAY
WAS A PERVERSION.

41:58.289 --> 42:02.360
WHEN YOU SAID
"CHEST COMPRESSIONS"
TO THAT POLICE OFFICER,

42:02.427 --> 42:04.195
NO, IT WASN'T
A MISTAKE, BOBBY.

42:04.262 --> 42:07.332
IT WAS A POSSIBLE ACCOUNT
FOR THE BRUISE.

42:07.398 --> 42:09.701
IT WAS A FALSE ACCOUNT.

42:12.203 --> 42:15.474
I WENT INTO A MORGUE
UNDER THE PRETEXT OF PRAYER

42:15.541 --> 42:17.375
SO YOU COULD GET
A QUICK LOOK AT THE BODY.

42:17.442 --> 42:19.277
AND YOU EXTORTED
THE ARCHBISHOP

42:19.344 --> 42:23.281
AS WELL AS ALICE'S PSYCHIATRIST
AND ONE OF YOUR OWN CLIENTS.

42:24.883 --> 42:28.854
I HIT A WOMAN
HARDER THAN I SHOULD HAVE

42:28.920 --> 42:31.823
WHILE PERFORMING A TOTALLY
UNAUTHORIZED EXORCISM.

42:31.890 --> 42:35.260
NOW, THE ONLY REASON
I'M DODGING THE BULLET

42:35.326 --> 42:39.765
IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW
TO MANIPULATE THE SYSTEM...

42:40.799 --> 42:42.734
IF NOT THE TRUTH.

42:45.270 --> 42:46.772
AND I HELPED.

42:53.912 --> 42:56.815
NOTHING I DID TODAY
WAS UNETHICAL...

42:56.882 --> 42:58.950
UNDER THE PRACTICE
OF LAW.

43:00.151 --> 43:03.221
I KNOW THAT.

43:03.288 --> 43:05.657
IT'S JUST THAT I'M TROUBLED
BY THE WHOLE THING.

43:07.426 --> 43:11.062
I'VE KNOWN YOU
YOUR WHOLE LIFE, BOBBY.
I'M YOUR PRIEST.

43:12.364 --> 43:15.333
WATCHING YOU WORK TODAY,
I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK

43:15.401 --> 43:18.437
THAT YOU'RE A MAN
WHO'S OBVIOUSLY SUCCESSFUL
AT WHAT HE DOES.

43:18.504 --> 43:20.271
AND I'M A MAN
WHO OBVIOUSLY ISN'T.

43:20.339 --> 43:23.975
NO. I DON'T MEAN TO DENY
MY UTTER GRATITUDE.

43:24.042 --> 43:24.976
IT...

43:27.245 --> 43:30.248
I DON'T QUESTION
WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR ME.

43:31.850 --> 43:36.254
I DO QUESTION WHAT
I HAVE DONE FOR YOU.

43:50.702 --> 43:52.304
YOU KNOW ME?

43:52.371 --> 43:54.139
YOU SHOULDN'T,
NO REASON TO.

43:54.205 --> 43:56.174
I'M JUST A
DOWN-IN-THE-TRENCHES LAWYER

43:56.241 --> 43:58.877
WHO DOES CASES THAT'LL
NEVER BE IN THE NEWSPAPERS,

43:58.944 --> 44:02.113
UNEXCITING STUFF, EXCEPT
TO THE PEOPLE INVOLVED...

44:02.180 --> 44:04.149
'CAUSE THEIR INJURIES
ARE REAL.

44:04.215 --> 44:06.151
AND THE MONEY
I GET THEM IS REAL.

44:06.217 --> 44:08.520
SOMEBODY BANG
INTO YOUR CAR LATELY?

44:08.587 --> 44:10.356
HAS A LADDER FALLEN
ON YOUR HEAD?

44:10.422 --> 44:11.990
YOU STEP INTO A POTHOLE?

44:12.057 --> 44:14.726
GO TO A BIG LAW FIRM
AND SEE HOW MUCH THEY CARE,

44:14.793 --> 44:16.262
THEN COME TO ME.

44:16.328 --> 44:19.331
THINK NOBODY'LL FIGHT FOR YOU,
YOU'RE JUST A GRUNT?

44:19.398 --> 44:20.799
I'M A GRUNT.

44:20.866 --> 44:22.701
THERE'S A LAWYER
OUT THERE FOR YOU.

44:22.964 --> 44:24.564
IT'S ME.

44:24.630 --> 44:25.630
JUST DIAL THE NUMBER...

44:27.997 --> 44:29.530
AND ASK FOR JIMMY.

44:29.597 --> 44:31.097
I'LL GET YOU MONEY.

44:33.864 --> 44:35.464
WHAT DO--WHAT DO YOU THINK?

44:38.264 --> 44:41.630
IT--IT'S STILL
A LITTLE ROUGH.

44:45.097 --> 44:48.030
IT'S GOT TO RESONATE
A LITTLE.

45:22.530 --> 45:24.297
YOU STINKER!
