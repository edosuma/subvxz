Mmm

08:49.028 --> 08:49.862

08:50.780 --> 08:51.781
Well, that's too bad.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.746
Hey, you took time to grab that?
Who were you planning to call?

08:58.829 --> 09:01.082
I grabbed a pack.
I did what I was supposed to do.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.959
Hey, kids, it could be worse.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.335

09:06.629 --> 09:08.130
Mom, no!

09:08.214 --> 09:11.008
Hey, what are you doing?
We haven't tested the atmosphere.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.303
You already did. Look.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.932

you'd be dead by now.

09:25.815 --> 09:29.318
Not a bad consolation prize.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.654
First fresh air in months.

09:46.502 --> 09:49.797
Mayday, mayday. This is <i>Jupiter 2.</i>
Do you read? Over.

09:55.219 --> 09:59.015
Probably should have read the fine print
before I launched into space.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.851
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Let's figure out where we are.</i>

10:02.226 --> 10:05.104

between home and the colony--

10:05.187 --> 10:07.732
Just call it Earth.
It's not your home anymore.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.736
Earth and the colony. This planet is unlike any
we have ever mapped.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.325
Wherever we are, I...
It's a Goldilocks planet.

10:17.408 --> 10:20.202
Earth-like atmosphere,
air-pressure, gravity.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.913
Clearly no lack of water. It's...

10:23.789 --> 10:25.583
The odds of that happening are...

10:26.751 --> 10:28.127
It's like winning the lottery.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.963

I can't raise any of the other Jupiters.

10:42.516 --> 10:46.312

10:46.395 --> 10:48.773
I'm sure they'll follow
emergency protocol.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.983
Hey, where does it hurt?

10:51.400 --> 10:54.737
-All across here.
-It's from the crash harness. It's normal.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.322
To you, maybe. Not to him.

10:56.405 --> 10:57.740
He didn't mean anything by it.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.076
Yeah, maybe he just forgot
we're not under his command.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.702
It's okay.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.790

11:05.873 --> 11:07.500
-Hold.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.388

11:20.805 --> 11:22.348

11:22.431 --> 11:24.016

it would be reddish.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.017
Right.

11:25.893 --> 11:26.811
Okay, hint.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.021
It's not a chemistry question,
it's a geology question.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.403

11:35.486 --> 11:38.489
the Jupiter's gonna be locked

11:39.573 --> 11:41.325
-A while.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.494
-It depends.

On hull thermodynamics, water salinity,

11:47.123 --> 11:50.251
how much displacement there is...
It's complicated. Does it matter?

11:50.334 --> 11:52.837

done the calculations.

11:55.005 --> 11:56.757

11:56.841 --> 11:58.801

12:06.225 --> 12:09.019
In six hours, the sun's gonna go down,

12:09.103 --> 12:13.524
and indications are, it will drop
to 60 degrees below zero,

12:13.607 --> 12:15.568
at which point, our power cells will die--

12:15.651 --> 12:16.694
And so will we.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.405
We can't go anywhere because of your leg.

12:19.488 --> 12:21.824
-I'm still figuring it out.

12:21.907 --> 12:22.950
Then you leave me here.

12:23.033 --> 12:25.494
You descend the glacier
and it'll be warmer down there.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.579
-Mom, stop!
-No, Mom!

12:26.662 --> 12:27.872
There's another way.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.044
We go back down, get one of the big
ion lithiums to recharge the suits.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.254
Not with that tear in your suit.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.715

you'll be dead in minutes.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.091

-No.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.351

12:49.435 --> 12:50.644
No. Absolutely not.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.771

passed the same tests.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.733

-Actually, you can. And he did.

12:56.984 --> 12:58.861
-Will, come with me.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.404

13:01.280 --> 13:03.240
Okay. You gotta listen to me.

13:03.324 --> 13:06.452

the same way you came out.

13:06.535 --> 13:10.039
Supply room's right there. It's easy.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.250

13:14.627 --> 13:18.297
Okay. Hey, hey, buddy.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.382

13:20.466 --> 13:22.635

13:22.927 --> 13:24.220
I'm gonna get the suit.

13:31.727 --> 13:34.813
Okay, here we go. Let's put this back on.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.920
It's gonna be okay.

16:46.255 --> 16:49.216
Your suit will keep you warm. And...

16:51.719 --> 16:54.430
-you've got at least five hours of oxygen.
-Okay.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.182
<i>So just don't talk any more</i>
<i>than you have to, okay?</i>

17:07.860 --> 17:11.447
Hey... you're in worse shape
than you look.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.991
Is that a compliment?

17:14.074 --> 17:15.659
You need to get some rest.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.411
I need to help my baby girl.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.621
We will. We will.

17:26.587 --> 17:29.339
No more doing anything until I say so.

17:34.636 --> 17:35.679
Maureen.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.265
Maureen.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.645
Is she okay?
Dad?

17:43.729 --> 17:46.648
It's okay. It's okay.
She's just resting.

17:48.484 --> 17:51.236
-Okay. It's okay.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.447
Judy...

17:54.740 --> 17:57.576
<i>-Judy, I just want to say--</i>
-Don't talk to me, please.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.640
You're almost to me, right?

18:23.727 --> 18:26.647
Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm getting there.

18:54.842 --> 18:55.843
What is it?

18:57.219 --> 18:59.805
The white fire. I figured out what it is.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.390
I don't have time for this.

19:03.725 --> 19:08.021
I mean, when we crashed, we must have
scraped open a pure vein of it.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.648
Vein of what?

19:10.232 --> 19:11.692
Magnesium.

19:13.610 --> 19:17.489
Magnesium burns hot.
But you know what makes it burn hotter?

19:20.909 --> 19:21.743
Ice.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.625
Judy, I gotta go get something.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.627
-<i>It'll help get you out.</i>

19:30.919 --> 19:31.962
I'll be back.

19:44.391 --> 19:47.728
-Gonna have to hold down the fort.
-It's actually more of a tent, but--

19:47.811 --> 19:50.981
You'll be fine.
Just radio me if anything goes wrong.

19:54.109 --> 19:55.235
Will, you coming?

19:56.612 --> 19:57.446
Me?

19:57.529 --> 20:01.074
Yeah, it's your idea.
And I don't know what I'm looking for.

20:01.700 --> 20:02.534
Come on.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.707
I'll see you later, okay?

20:58.924 --> 21:01.677
Hi. Can I look at this one, please?
Thank you.

21:06.306 --> 21:08.350
It looks really expensive.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.269
Mom, it's babysitting money.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.354
It's like being paid to study.

21:12.437 --> 21:15.107
I know we're not doing Secret Santa,
but I wanna get a gift for Dad,

21:15.190 --> 21:16.191
in case he shows up. He's done it before.

21:20.195 --> 21:22.823
I just don't want you
to be disappointed again. Well, it's a good thing I got thick skin.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.538
You shouldn't have to have thick skin.

21:30.747 --> 21:33.125
He's been in the worst of it
for two years.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.377
Mom, he's made sacrifices. So should we.

21:36.503 --> 21:38.046
-Okay.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.299
Oh, here. I'll put it on the card.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.884
Just for the points.
You can pay me when I get the bill.

21:42.968 --> 21:43.969
Sure, okay.

21:46.763 --> 21:48.682
How easy is it to return this?

21:49.308 --> 21:51.852
It's fine, as long as it hasn't been worn.

21:52.436 --> 21:53.854
Yeah. It won't be.

21:54.187 --> 21:57.524
Hey, Mom, I'm gonna go
find a present for Judy.

21:57.607 --> 22:01.194
She told me to give it to charity,
but she's just trying to make me look bad.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.040
How's Mom?

22:13.749 --> 22:15.500
I thought you weren't
supposed to be talking.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.711
Yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

22:21.214 --> 22:23.008
Seriously, how is she?

22:23.842 --> 22:26.511
<i>She's... She's still out. Uh...</i>

22:27.095 --> 22:30.057
Breathing and her heart rate is normal.

22:32.934 --> 22:34.019
Keep talking.

22:34.728 --> 22:37.773
Pretty high up on the list of things
I never thought I'd hear you say.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.275
You must have some books
loaded on your phone.

22:41.526 --> 22:42.861
<i>Do you have anything good?</i>

22:43.695 --> 22:48.950
I, in fact, happen to have
some of the best books ever written.

22:49.326 --> 22:53.372
<i>Complete Dickens, complete Shakespeare--</i>

22:53.455 --> 22:57.667
Do you have anything... trashy?

22:58.585 --> 23:01.379
Why would I bring something trashy
to the new world?

23:01.463 --> 23:05.425
"We're here to establish a colony
to expand the bounds of human experience."

23:05.801 --> 23:06.760
Hmm.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.138
Well, they say everyone should read
<i>Moby-Dick</i> before they die.

23:15.268 --> 23:18.146
-Don't say that.

23:19.981 --> 23:21.525
Of course I have it.

23:22.150 --> 23:23.360
<i>Well, is it any good?</i>

23:28.365 --> 23:29.533
I don't know.

23:30.242 --> 23:33.036
Um... I haven't gotten to the M's yet.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.748
Well, proceed.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.385
"Call me Ishmael."

23:48.468 --> 23:50.804
Okay, "Ishmael," if you insist.

23:50.887 --> 23:53.974
Okay, first of all,
that wasn't even remotely funny.

23:54.057 --> 23:59.437
And, secondly, you're supposed to be
conserving oxygen. So, quiet.

24:01.731 --> 24:03.066
<i>"Call me Ishmael.</i>

24:05.277 --> 24:08.405
<i>Some years ago,</i>
<i>never mind how long precisely..."</i>

24:18.498 --> 24:21.793
Just follow my lead.
Not sure how stable this glacier is.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.629
Don't wanna fall down a crevasse.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.464
Wait, that could happen?

24:28.300 --> 24:29.509
Just follow my lead.

24:33.263 --> 24:34.514
So, uh...

24:35.599 --> 24:37.684
So what are you into nowadays?

24:38.018 --> 24:39.978
I mean, besides magnesium.

24:40.061 --> 24:44.941
I'm not. I just ended up
testing into the geology program.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.318
Yeah, well, they do that.

24:47.485 --> 24:49.487
You're good at something,
they make you do it.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.367
I remember you used to like baseball.

24:55.744 --> 24:56.703
Yeah.

24:59.456 --> 25:01.208
Yeah, I used to.

25:01.666 --> 25:02.626
Models?

25:03.585 --> 25:05.170
Does anyone make models anymore?

25:06.671 --> 25:08.006
I like to read.

25:10.383 --> 25:15.764
I don't think I've read anything except
instruction manuals for... years.

25:24.898 --> 25:26.024
Oh, damn.

25:27.234 --> 25:31.488
Yes. That... That's a lot of magnesium.

25:31.571 --> 25:32.697
Well...

25:34.491 --> 25:36.993
What do you say we go get some
that isn't burning?

25:38.036 --> 25:38.870
Come on.

25:52.551 --> 25:56.012
<i>"Enveloped in their shaggy</i>
<i>watch coats, and with their heads</i>

25:56.096 --> 25:57.639
<i>-muffled in woolen--"</i>
<i>Penny!</i>

25:58.473 --> 26:04.104
What? Mom! Mom, easy.
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

26:04.437 --> 26:07.399
-He went with Dad to get some magnesium.

26:08.275 --> 26:09.109
What?

26:11.319 --> 26:12.529
Whose idea was that?

26:14.364 --> 26:15.198
Will's.

26:19.869 --> 26:21.037
What're we looking for?

26:22.247 --> 26:24.040
It's that grayish stuff there.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.339
That's what it looks like
before it ignites.

26:31.923 --> 26:35.552
Hey, I'm, uh...
I'm not gonna blow us up, am I?

26:37.137 --> 26:38.596
Not unless you make a spark.

26:40.807 --> 26:41.641
Okay.

26:50.275 --> 26:53.194
-Judy's got plenty of time.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.827
Hey, it happened.

27:02.162 --> 27:04.581
It happened because I froze up.

27:04.664 --> 27:07.959
You jumped through a lot of hoops
to get on this mission.

27:08.543 --> 27:11.212
You earned your spot
just like everyone else.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.881
I don't feel like everyone else.

27:21.097 --> 27:23.308
I think we've got enough to get her out.

27:23.391 --> 27:25.310
Now, let's get out of here
before it blows up.

27:29.606 --> 27:34.361
-Will! Will! Will!

27:43.286 --> 27:46.831
Will, do you read me? Will!

27:49.209 --> 27:50.335
Here.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.548
Hey.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.136
It's getting worse, isn't it?

28:01.346 --> 28:03.431
Feels like my leg is in a vice.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.311
Penny, I think we should take a look.

28:20.281 --> 28:22.450
-Oh, yeah.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.328
<i>Yeah, her leg is hard as a rock.</i>

28:25.453 --> 28:28.039
Okay. Mom, I think you have
compartment syndrome.

28:28.456 --> 28:31.459
<i>Edema from the fracture has created </i>
<i>too much pressure in your leg.</i>

28:31.543 --> 28:32.460
<i>We have to release it.</i>

28:32.544 --> 28:35.004
<i>Penny's gonna have to do</i>
<i>a little procedure, okay?</i>

28:35.088 --> 28:36.423
Uh, no, she's not.

28:36.506 --> 28:38.800
<i>-I'll talk her through it.</i>
-It's your call.

28:38.883 --> 28:41.386
Penny, there's a combo syringe
in the kit.

28:42.053 --> 28:45.473
<i>-It's blue and white. It'll knock her out.</i>
<i></i>

28:51.146 --> 28:56.192
It's okay? Okay. Okay. Yeah.

28:56.901 --> 28:59.070
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:59.154 --> 29:01.406
Okay. We have to do
a four-compartment fasciotomy.

29:01.489 --> 29:03.324
How hard is this procedure?

29:04.200 --> 29:07.203
-I've heard it's pretty straightforward.
-You've <i>heard</i> it's pretty straight...

29:09.038 --> 29:10.415
You haven't done this before?

29:11.124 --> 29:14.252
Okay. Lay out the scalpel
and plenty of gauze, okay?

29:14.878 --> 29:19.674
Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Okay.

29:27.766 --> 29:28.725
Okay.

29:28.808 --> 29:31.478
There are four spaces in the lower leg
containing muscle

29:31.561 --> 29:34.397
<i>-that are surrounded by fascia.</i>

29:34.481 --> 29:37.066
You know that white stuff you see
when you eat steak?

29:37.150 --> 29:39.277
<i>That's fascia. The red stuff, it's muscle.</i>

29:39.360 --> 29:40.195
Okay.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.198
It's just like steak.

29:43.948 --> 29:45.492
I like steak.

29:45.575 --> 29:48.578
This is not Mom, this is steak.

29:50.038 --> 29:50.997
Yeah.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.583
Find the bone that sticks out
under the kneecap.

29:54.250 --> 29:58.379
Move about two fingers away from it
down on either side,

29:58.463 --> 30:00.340
<i>-and cut all the way down.</i>
-Okay.

30:00.715 --> 30:02.258
Cut all the way down to where?

30:02.342 --> 30:03.968
All the way down to her ankle.

30:07.013 --> 30:09.557
<i>Penny, you have to cut deep, okay?</i>

30:09.641 --> 30:13.311
Until you see the muscle. The steak.
Cut until you see the steak.

30:14.354 --> 30:19.108
The steak. Okay,
it's just a really juicy piece of steak.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.569
I'm done! Done! I did it!

30:21.653 --> 30:24.239
Great. Now you only have to do it
three times more.

30:35.834 --> 30:36.793
Dad?

30:38.253 --> 30:39.796
Dad, come in.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.677
Dad! Dad!

31:16.291 --> 31:18.668
<i>Will, do you read me? Will.</i>

31:18.751 --> 31:20.879
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

31:23.548 --> 31:24.549
Are you hurt?

31:25.300 --> 31:26.134
No.

31:26.718 --> 31:27.719
Thank God.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.555
<i>Can you get back up here?</i>

31:35.727 --> 31:37.937
No. I don't think so.

31:38.229 --> 31:40.565
<i>Okay, where are you?</i>
<i>What do you see?</i>

31:41.524 --> 31:42.609
<i>Are you safe?</i>

31:43.860 --> 31:46.863
There's vegetation all over the place.

31:46.946 --> 31:49.866
<i>So there's bound to be things</i>
<i>that eat the vegetation...</i>

31:50.325 --> 31:53.494
and things that eat those things.

31:53.953 --> 31:56.789
Okay. Just... Just don't touch anything.

31:56.873 --> 32:00.418
Yeah. Just get down here soon. Okay?

32:00.501 --> 32:03.129
Of course I will. But I, uh...

32:07.050 --> 32:08.134
It's gonna take some time.

32:09.969 --> 32:11.471
<i>Time your sister doesn't have.</i>

32:11.554 --> 32:12.430
Wait.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.058
<i>Wait, you're leaving?</i>

32:15.850 --> 32:18.728
I have to go help Judy first.

32:18.811 --> 32:22.231
And then I'm turning around
and coming straight back here.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.943
<i>I'll be back soon, I promise.</i>

32:28.321 --> 32:29.781
<i>You're going to be fine.</i>

32:32.158 --> 32:33.076
<i>Will?</i>

32:34.827 --> 32:36.496
You got that? You're gonna be fine.

32:41.751 --> 32:42.710
Go save her.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.298
You have to.

32:55.473 --> 32:56.724
I'll be fine.

33:09.028 --> 33:11.406
It's crazy that they built this thing
for real.

33:13.491 --> 33:15.410
Someday we're gonna be on it.

33:16.369 --> 33:17.245
You are.

33:18.705 --> 33:21.833
Hey, the test results haven't come in yet.
Wait until they do.

33:23.459 --> 33:25.837
I froze up. And...

33:26.421 --> 33:30.425
the man giving the test made a face
when I stepped out of the tank.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.678
He made a face at me, too.

33:35.096 --> 33:38.391
It's their job. To make faces.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.231
If I didn't pass, then...

33:48.818 --> 33:50.987
that means they're gonna
make me stay behind.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.369
So, we need to get something clear.

33:59.537 --> 34:00.538
Look at me.

34:03.124 --> 34:08.463
There's a rule that's written in stone.
And it is never broken.

34:10.798 --> 34:13.217
The Robinsons stick together.

34:22.435 --> 34:23.686
What are you doing?

34:25.271 --> 34:27.482
I'll just borrow your manuals
when they come in.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.448
All right, let's do this.

34:36.991 --> 34:40.161
-Do I paint first or--
Use this to trim the edges.

34:40.244 --> 34:41.662
To trim the edges.

35:00.306 --> 35:02.975
When you were little,
I always loved to watch you sleep.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.937
I don't think you should be moving around.

35:07.021 --> 35:08.564
Well, it's excellent work.

35:09.941 --> 35:15.029
No, Judy did the hard part.
The studying and the exams...

35:18.825 --> 35:21.911
You're all that matters, you know.
You three.

35:23.996 --> 35:25.706
It's why we left.

35:27.208 --> 35:30.419
I wanted to find a home
that was worthy of you.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.426
We're gonna make it.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.389
Of course we are.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.978
Every problem has a solution.

37:04.889 --> 37:05.890
Hi, Will.

37:06.724 --> 37:10.311
So, tell your sisters
that we're going out for Mexican.

37:12.230 --> 37:16.692
Yeah, I heard colony tortillas
leave a funny aftertaste

37:16.776 --> 37:18.361
because of the hybrid corn.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.698
Yes.

37:24.575 --> 37:25.660
Yes.

37:27.828 --> 37:29.121
We're celebrating.

37:56.774 --> 38:00.319
This is Will Robinson of the <i>Jupiter 2.</i>
Over.

38:01.988 --> 38:03.614
Calling any survivors. -Come in.

38:07.243 --> 38:08.327
Do you copy?

39:27.198 --> 39:30.743
Hello Is anyone there?

40:06.153 --> 40:08.072
That's not a Jupiter.

40:21.168 --> 40:24.839
This is Will Robinson
of the 24th Colonist Group.

40:25.673 --> 40:28.884
I'm making a record of this
because it seems...

40:30.136 --> 40:35.307
I'm the first human to discover evidence
of an alien intelligence.

40:39.478 --> 40:42.356
It... It appears it crashed when we did.

40:43.149 --> 40:45.776
Why? I don't know why.

40:47.403 --> 40:49.405
I don't even know why we crashed.

40:50.281 --> 40:53.909
The The ship has sustained
heavy amounts of damage

40:53.993 --> 40:56.203
and appears to be non-functional.

40:57.329 --> 41:01.292
No sign of any... pa-- passengers.

41:11.760 --> 41:14.305
Hello

42:05.481 --> 42:08.817
How...
How can you see me?

42:23.332 --> 42:24.792
No! No!

42:25.251 --> 42:26.377
No. No.

42:33.175 --> 42:36.512
Judy, I'm back.
I'm gonna get you out of there.

42:38.222 --> 42:40.683
-I'm gonna go back for him.

42:40.766 --> 42:42.810
What

42:42.893 --> 42:44.770
We got separated, but he's okay.

42:44.853 --> 42:46.355
You just left him there? I can only save one child at a time.

42:52.820 --> 42:53.696
Better get back.

42:58.284 --> 43:01.495
Penny, how much air does she have left?

43:01.912 --> 43:03.247
Sixty-eight minutes.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.920
Judy. Close your eyes.

43:11.088 --> 43:12.298
Keep them closed.

43:23.851 --> 43:24.977
Wow.

43:31.150 --> 43:33.694
It's working. Thank God.

43:33.777 --> 43:35.070
It was Will's idea.

43:35.738 --> 43:37.364
Yeah. I know.

43:39.199 --> 43:41.577
He thinks he doesn't deserve to be here.

43:43.162 --> 43:45.873
I'll discuss that with him
the next time I see him.

43:47.416 --> 43:48.667
When do you think that might be?

43:55.758 --> 43:56.759
Thanks.

44:00.638 --> 44:01.513
Hey.

44:02.056 --> 44:02.973
<i>Hey.</i>

44:04.933 --> 44:07.019
You're not that easy to find these days.

44:08.062 --> 44:09.563
<i>Well, that's the way they like it.</i>

44:10.439 --> 44:12.566
What with everything that's going on.

44:13.692 --> 44:14.652
<i>Right.</i>

44:15.694 --> 44:18.864
-Uh, everybody's fine.

44:20.407 --> 44:21.367
They miss me?

44:23.786 --> 44:24.703
I don't know.

44:31.752 --> 44:32.961
Why are you calling?

44:34.880 --> 44:36.048
I have good news.

44:37.341 --> 44:41.136
We have been accepted
into the 24th Colonist Group.

44:43.263 --> 44:45.599
-Wow.

44:46.225 --> 44:48.143
What's the timetable on that?

44:48.227 --> 44:49.561
<i>Uh, a month.</i>

44:49.645 --> 44:53.399
The kids performed sensationally.
You should be proud of them.

44:53.482 --> 44:55.317
I am. I am. Of course I am.

44:57.236 --> 44:58.362
So, I sent you some papers

44:58.445 --> 45:01.323
<i>and I just need you to sign them </i>
<i>and send them back.</i>

45:01.824 --> 45:03.867
So, you're finally filing for divorce?

45:04.701 --> 45:05.953
<i>No. I... </i>

45:07.329 --> 45:09.915
<i>That doesn't seem necessary anymore.</i>

45:11.917 --> 45:14.711
I need your permission
so that they can go.

45:23.720 --> 45:25.305
You wanna take my kids away from me? You already left, John.

45:28.642 --> 45:30.728
-Not for forever.
<i>-After everything that's happened,</i>

45:30.811 --> 45:34.565
you have this one chance
to do what's best for them.

45:36.150 --> 45:37.359
<i>Just...</i>

45:38.152 --> 45:40.112
sign the papers please.

45:41.989 --> 45:43.657
This isn't about us.

45:55.335 --> 45:56.170
Dad.

45:58.964 --> 46:00.048
Dad, this is Will.

46:00.883 --> 46:02.092
Do you read me?

46:02.968 --> 46:05.721
I'm kind of in a lot of danger here.

46:06.638 --> 46:11.351
Probably not as much danger as before,
but definitely still in danger.

46:17.065 --> 46:20.152
That noise, I've heard it before.

46:20.235 --> 46:23.906
It's coming from your ship. Isn't it?

46:28.619 --> 46:30.787
Who knows if you can even understand me.

46:42.341 --> 46:43.258
Whoa.

47:02.194 --> 47:04.822
Guess you've never seen
anything like that either.

47:15.165 --> 47:17.543
My name's Will Robinson, by the way.

47:19.878 --> 47:20.712
Wait...

47:22.839 --> 47:24.883
what's happening to your lights?

47:39.940 --> 47:40.899
Oh...

47:46.113 --> 47:47.155
You're dying.

47:48.907 --> 47:50.033
Aren't you?

48:08.135 --> 48:09.803
It's working, honey.
Hold tight.

48:10.846 --> 48:11.847
<i>Oh, God.</i>

48:11.930 --> 48:13.056
That feels good.

48:13.849 --> 48:15.893
It's like my hand's been asleep
for a month.

48:15.976 --> 48:18.770
-It's okay, the feeling will come back.

48:20.856 --> 48:22.399
-Magnesium.
-Magnesium.

48:23.692 --> 48:25.193
-Okay.
-Torch. Close your eyes.

48:30.699 --> 48:32.826
Okay. Okay.

48:44.463 --> 48:45.922
It's raining.

48:56.099 --> 48:57.184
It's raining, Dad.

48:58.518 --> 49:00.187
Oh, no, no, no!

49:00.270 --> 49:03.065
Faster! Faster! It's filling up.

49:10.280 --> 49:12.282
It's... It's not raining, is it?

49:18.330 --> 49:19.623
Yes. It is.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.963
Mom, the temperature's dropping!

49:29.091 --> 49:30.509
Oh, oh...

49:31.218 --> 49:32.511
Give me the magnesium.

49:42.646 --> 49:43.480
Damn it!

49:48.860 --> 49:49.945
Damn it.

49:51.738 --> 49:53.281
<i>We're gonna get you out.</i>

49:56.868 --> 49:59.746
She's strong. She has more time.

50:01.331 --> 50:02.207
Dig!

50:03.583 --> 50:05.752
Come on! Dig!

50:07.879 --> 50:08.714
Coming, baby!

50:34.156 --> 50:36.491
Dad. Dad, come in.

50:38.493 --> 50:42.330
Dad, there's a fire and...
and I can't get out.

50:46.334 --> 50:48.879
Dad. Dad, come in.

51:54.319 --> 51:55.946
No point in you dying, too.

53:27.913 --> 53:28.872
Thanks.

54:08.078 --> 54:09.371
<i>Will! Will!</i>

54:10.205 --> 54:14.918
It's not his fault!
He's gonna be...

54:16.586 --> 54:18.588
Don't talk! Just don't talk.

54:18.672 --> 54:19.923
Dad!

54:23.385 --> 54:24.761
We're here.

54:26.721 --> 54:27.973
I'm here, baby.

54:29.516 --> 54:33.186
<i>We're here. We're here.</i>

54:33.269 --> 54:36.231
We're right here.

54:39.567 --> 54:40.986
It's okay. We're here.

54:42.696 --> 54:43.738
We're here.

54:50.996 --> 54:53.415
What's that

55:09.347 --> 55:10.181
It's okay.

55:10.265 --> 55:11.891
-It's okay.

55:11.975 --> 55:14.311
He's... He's with me.

55:26.364 --> 55:28.575
Danger, Will Robinson.

55:39.169 --> 55:40.170
Can you help her?

55:41.921 --> 55:42.839
Please?

56:28.802 --> 56:30.512
I got you.

56:30.595 --> 56:31.846
-It's okay.
-Judy!

56:31.930 --> 56:34.182
I've got you.
Judy!

56:34.265 --> 56:35.433
Breathe!

56:35.517 --> 56:37.519
Breathe, baby! Breathe!

56:39.979 --> 56:41.648
Mom!

56:42.398 --> 56:45.110
-It's okay. I got you.
-Mom.

56:51.116 --> 56:53.118
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

56:53.201 --> 56:55.954
Can you do something so we don't freeze?

57:35.869 --> 57:37.579

57:45.670 --> 57:47.338
It's just a temporary evacuation.

57:48.047 --> 57:50.175
I'm sure they'll have
the damage repaired soon.

57:52.677 --> 57:54.637
It seems like an overreaction.

57:58.057 --> 57:59.601
The sooner we seal the breach,

57:59.684 --> 58:02.562
the sooner we can get back to bitching
about being underpaid.

58:03.354 --> 58:04.731
We're being paid a fortune.

58:04.814 --> 58:08.193
Ah, that was before we had a chance
of being sucked out into space.

58:08.276 --> 58:09.194
Go.

-Oh, thank you. Thank you.
-Here. Get your coat off.

-No, I can't walk.
