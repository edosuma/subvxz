01:01.912 --> 01:03.384
Yay! Yay!

01:04.081 --> 01:06.253
- Rohan! Rohan!
- This is anarchy!

01:06.459 --> 01:07.966
Yeah!

01:08.086 --> 01:09.972
It was a stray bomb.

01:10.213 --> 01:11.934
Thank you, Adolf.

01:15.928 --> 01:19.108
It was 1952, nine years later.

01:19.349 --> 01:23.774
I was waiting to be called up to serve
two years' conscription in the Army.

01:23.895 --> 01:26.399
I was 18.
I hoped they'd forgotten me.

01:26.940 --> 01:28.910
After all, we were easy to miss.

01:29.026 --> 01:31.660
We lived on an island in the River Thames.

01:31.779 --> 01:34.330
You had to ring a bell to reach us.

01:37.703 --> 01:39.790
I swam each morning at the same hour

01:39.913 --> 01:42.471
because a lovely girl
rode past on the tow path.

01:43.042 --> 01:46.308
I promised myself that one day
I would swim across and meet her.

01:46.646 --> 01:47.897
But I never did.

01:56.974 --> 01:59.478
Cut, cut!
Get him out of there.

01:59.681 --> 02:01.687
Dry him off.
Go again.

02:02.022 --> 02:04.276
Feeble, feeble.
Dry him off.

02:13.281 --> 02:15.050
- Cut.
- End board.

02:15.075 --> 02:16.795
Cut.
Get him out.

02:16.959 --> 02:20.368
They did it over and over
until they got it right.

02:21.001 --> 02:23.722
That seemed much better than fife.
Where you only got one go.

02:26.215 --> 02:29.348
That'll do.
Print it. That's a wrap.

02:29.955 --> 02:33.419
We lived near the famous
Shepperton Film Studios.

02:37.812 --> 02:39.153
Billy!

02:44.194 --> 02:46.235
I thought
they'd forgotten you, Billy.

02:47.114 --> 02:48.668
It's come.

02:48.782 --> 02:50.752
They'll have their work cut out,

02:50.868 --> 02:53.372
making a soldier of you, pipsqueak.

03:07.236 --> 03:08.488
We're locked in.

03:08.513 --> 03:10.364
It's only for two years.

03:10.390 --> 03:13.288
Hands out of your pockets!
Get in three ranks!

03:13.314 --> 03:15.235
Get in step!
Left, right! Left, right!

03:15.354 --> 03:19.115
Left right! Left right!
Left, right! Left, right!

03:19.483 --> 03:22.248
- Percy Hapgood.
- Bill Rohan.

03:22.487 --> 03:25.287
And Percy, this could be
the beginning of a...

03:25.407 --> 03:26.949
a beautiful fucking friendship.

03:27.529 --> 03:30.247
- Claude Rains?
- Humphrey Bogart.

03:30.538 --> 03:31.789
Casablanca.

03:39.942 --> 03:41.532
Big head, come here.

03:41.758 --> 03:43.182
You stand there.
Come round.

03:43.761 --> 03:45.564
Move.
Move.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.566
Get on the end.
On the end.

03:47.682 --> 03:50.945
Come here now.
Get in. Get in. Stand still.

03:52.062 --> 03:53.801
Right, put your berets on straight.

03:54.273 --> 03:57.322
Right, your berets, the cap badges
need to be above the left eye.

03:57.526 --> 03:59.496
What a pitiful bunch.

03:59.987 --> 04:01.328
Turn!

04:01.447 --> 04:03.670
- Left, two, three, one!
- Right, two, three, one!

04:03.695 --> 04:04.955
Jesus!
What a rabble!

04:04.981 --> 04:07.674
Put your right arm up now.
Your right arm.

04:07.788 --> 04:09.674
You, big head, get on the end.

04:09.790 --> 04:12.386
Swap over with the ginger one.
Swap over.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.808
Put your arm up.
Arm's distance from the man on your right.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.310
Put it up now. Put it up!

04:17.423 --> 04:20.281
Look over your shoulder there.
Look over at the man next to you.

04:20.305 --> 04:21.897
Stand to attention!

04:22.179 --> 04:25.892
Slope arms!
Present arms!

04:26.104 --> 04:29.699
Shoulder arms!
Order arms!

04:30.173 --> 04:31.466
Stand still!

04:32.274 --> 04:34.160
About turn!

04:34.276 --> 04:35.617
Shh.

04:36.195 --> 04:37.867
Out of the way!

04:38.656 --> 04:41.604
- Stand still!
- What a bunch of wankers!

04:43.036 --> 04:45.531
You've got six weeks to shape up,

04:45.642 --> 04:48.871
then off to Korea
to fight the might of the Red Army.

04:49.167 --> 04:51.469
You lot against the Chinese.

05:00.096 --> 05:01.348
Shut up!

05:02.059 --> 05:05.239
- Go back to sleep, you arsehole.
- Put a sock in it.

05:05.477 --> 05:07.234
Fucking hell.

05:09.165 --> 05:10.506
Fuck you.

05:18.492 --> 05:19.963
Jane Russell.

05:25.542 --> 05:26.857
She was in my bed last night.

05:26.883 --> 05:28.686
I said, "Get out.
Too narrow for the two of us."

05:28.712 --> 05:30.843
Then she jumped into bed with me
and woke me up.

05:31.634 --> 05:33.188
Left, right!
Left, right!

05:33.425 --> 05:35.016
Left, right! Left!

05:36.637 --> 05:39.402
About turn!

05:39.516 --> 05:42.102
Left, right! Left, forward!

05:45.230 --> 05:47.865
About turn!

05:47.983 --> 05:49.989
Left, right! Left, forward!

05:50.111 --> 05:51.997
Left, right! Left, right!

05:52.113 --> 05:55.791
Left, right! Left, right!
Left, right! Left!

05:56.284 --> 05:59.749
About turn!

06:00.372 --> 06:03.801
Left, right! Left, forward!

06:03.918 --> 06:06.094
When we go! It right,
it was exhilarating.

06:06.215 --> 06:09.229
We were like a dance troupe.
Except Percy, who thought it was...

06:09.344 --> 06:10.595
Shit.

06:10.634 --> 06:12.770
Eyes right!

06:16.349 --> 06:18.769
Eyes front!

06:26.777 --> 06:28.070
Oh!

06:28.821 --> 06:30.292
Bastard! I've had enough.

06:30.462 --> 06:33.092
As soon as he's taught me how to do it,
I'm gonna kill him.

06:33.117 --> 06:34.718
"Murder is my favourite crime."

06:34.744 --> 06:37.057
- Who's that? Edward G Robinson?
- No, Clifton Webb.

06:38.499 --> 06:41.049
Elbow. Elbow. Elbow.

06:42.199 --> 06:46.053
When we finished the commando course,
Percy and I expected to be sent to Korea,

06:46.078 --> 06:47.763
or to teach others how to kill.

06:47.884 --> 06:49.972
But no, they made us Sergeant Instructors

06:50.679 --> 06:52.357
and we had to teach them how to type.

06:52.514 --> 06:56.311
A-R-M-Y!

06:56.435 --> 06:57.907
Space!

06:58.312 --> 07:00.282
Return carriage.

07:01.191 --> 07:05.248
You are slouching and slovenly!
Sit to attention!

07:06.989 --> 07:09.457
You will type at attention!

07:16.249 --> 07:17.970
Resume typing at the slouch.

07:20.421 --> 07:23.470
The quick brown fox jumps
over the lazy dog.

07:23.591 --> 07:27.435
The, T-H-E, space...

07:27.762 --> 07:32.692
quick, Q-U-I-C-K, space...

07:33.060 --> 07:38.447
brown, B-R-OW-N, space...

07:38.566 --> 07:42.114
fox, F-O-X, space.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.372
Return carriage.

07:44.489 --> 07:46.495
Do you know why you're here?
Yes?

07:46.617 --> 07:48.373
Because you are the dregs.

07:48.494 --> 07:51.840
Because you can't shoot
and you can't march.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.881
We get the dregs.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.292
Well, your arses
will be glued to these seats

07:56.503 --> 07:58.674
until you can touch-type like girls!

07:58.700 --> 08:02.414
Your, Y-O-U-R, space...

08:02.760 --> 08:06.901
arses, A-R-S-E-S, space,

08:07.015 --> 08:10.278
will, W-I-L-L, space,

08:10.393 --> 08:12.399
be, B-E, space,

08:12.521 --> 08:14.906
glued, G-L-U-E...

08:15.024 --> 08:16.577
What's your name, soldier?

08:16.692 --> 08:17.943
Private Kitto, Sarge.

08:18.277 --> 08:20.093
And why are you typing gibberish?

08:20.738 --> 08:22.079
There's no point.

08:22.449 --> 08:24.630
You'll see the point
if I put you on jankers.

08:25.035 --> 08:27.206
It's all over, everything.

08:27.496 --> 08:29.797
Ah. Armageddon. Atomic war.

08:30.458 --> 08:32.344
- It's inevitable.
- I agree.

08:32.626 --> 08:34.712
But while we're waiting,
learn to fucking type.

08:35.922 --> 08:40.597
T-O-U-C-H, type, T-Y-P-E, space,
like, L-I-K-E,

08:40.719 --> 08:45.311
girls, G-I-R-L-S!

08:45.933 --> 08:47.548
Return carriage!

08:48.019 --> 08:49.490
Oh, bother. Sergeant?

08:50.897 --> 08:52.238
I think I made a mistake.

08:52.607 --> 08:54.447
Okay, Henderson.

08:54.693 --> 08:56.663
You're the clown of the class.

08:56.862 --> 08:59.911
There's always one and
it always ends badly.

09:00.408 --> 09:03.671
Just trying to type like a girl,
like you said, Sarge.

09:08.542 --> 09:09.930
And be proud.

09:10.044 --> 09:13.176
Remember, if a pen
is mightier than the sword,

09:13.248 --> 09:16.179
well, a typewriter can be
more terrible than a tank.

09:18.454 --> 09:21.254
You will conduct
the instruction of these soldiers

09:21.280 --> 09:24.831
according to the manual
and properly dressed, Sergeant Rohan.

09:24.953 --> 09:26.655
Your top button is undone.

09:26.771 --> 09:29.038
You will be arraigned
before the company commander.

09:29.065 --> 09:30.316
What, for a button?

09:30.400 --> 09:32.203
Yes, for a button!

09:32.229 --> 09:34.281
For the want of a nail, a kingdom was lost.

09:34.488 --> 09:36.707
Discipline. Wars are won and lost...

09:36.824 --> 09:38.794
on buttons, sir?

09:41.956 --> 09:44.375
Insolence will be appended to that charge.

09:44.416 --> 09:48.177
Private Redmond, I instructed you
to remove these boxes.

09:48.245 --> 09:51.510
Will you explain why they are still
present and cluttering up the office?

09:51.535 --> 09:56.091
And you do not salute an NCO,
Private Redmond.

09:56.355 --> 09:58.859
Out of respect to you,
Sergeant Major Bradley.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.350
Spontaneous, like.

10:00.684 --> 10:01.935
The boxes.

10:02.978 --> 10:05.149
Excused lifting. Hernia.

10:05.898 --> 10:07.239
I have a chitty from the doc.

10:07.525 --> 10:11.073
Those boxes are empty, Redmond.
Empty.

10:11.738 --> 10:13.743
It's not the weight, Sergeant Major.

10:13.769 --> 10:17.068
It's the act of lifting.
It's in the bending of the knees.

10:17.786 --> 10:19.293
I'll do it.

10:19.931 --> 10:23.147
Put that box down, Sergeant!
You're not an orderly.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.843
Right.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.976
Lifting is not specified.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.971
Implied, Sergeant Major.
Implied.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.780
Those boxes can be lifted
without bending the knees

10:39.805 --> 10:42.226
and I instruct you to do so.
Refusing to obey an order

10:42.310 --> 10:44.991
is a court martial offence!

10:45.105 --> 10:47.026
Fire!

10:47.148 --> 10:48.739
Fire!

10:52.279 --> 10:53.531
Fire!

11:12.423 --> 11:14.645
- Don't you hate being hemmed in?
- No, I love it.

11:16.178 --> 11:18.174
I could stomach it if
it wasn't for Bradley.

11:18.199 --> 11:20.287
- We can't do much about that.
- Yes, we can.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.136
- What?
- We set him up.

11:22.855 --> 11:25.110
Get rid of him. Bump him off.

11:25.233 --> 11:27.300
You haven't killed that other sergeant yet.

11:27.326 --> 11:30.990
- Good point. Let's find some girls.
- You're still a virgin, aren't you?

11:31.016 --> 11:32.994
- No, no, no, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

11:33.117 --> 11:35.418
No, I'm not.
I've kissed loads of girls.

11:52.889 --> 11:54.312
There. There.

11:55.559 --> 11:56.810
Sorry-

11:59.313 --> 12:00.701
Shh.

12:27.928 --> 12:31.310
Forget the unobtainable
and take what's on offer.

13:02.217 --> 13:03.474
We're in.

13:47.017 --> 13:49.521
- Oh.
- It was lovely to see you.

13:54.817 --> 13:56.408
Hello. Percy.

13:56.528 --> 13:58.615
- Sophie.
- Peggy.

13:58.739 --> 14:00.080
Hi.

14:00.741 --> 14:01.992
You coming? We're leaving.

14:03.244 --> 14:06.518
There was such pain in her eyes, Percy.
I think she needs help.

14:06.706 --> 14:08.094
Hold on.

14:08.468 --> 14:10.917
Don't get into that shit.
We're the ones who need help.

14:10.943 --> 14:12.187
Come on.

14:12.213 --> 14:15.640
Bill, this is the beautiful Sophie
and her lovely friend Peggy.

14:15.758 --> 14:17.265
Hello.
Are you shy, Bill?

14:17.384 --> 14:18.642
Mmm-mmm.

14:19.262 --> 14:21.812
Yes, you are. I just made you blush.

14:24.184 --> 14:25.856
- He's still a virgin.
- No, I'm not.

14:25.977 --> 14:28.149
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not. Shut up.

14:29.648 --> 14:30.957
Come on!

14:30.983 --> 14:33.403
We have to be in by 10:00!

14:39.659 --> 14:40.917
That's our dorm!

14:43.289 --> 14:45.009
Come on, girls. Faster.

14:45.583 --> 14:47.351
Come along now, girls. Inside, quickly.

14:47.685 --> 14:49.046
How fast can you run?

14:49.071 --> 14:51.975
- You two! Come on! Late again!
- Sorry, Matron.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.475
- Sorry, Matron.
- Go away!

14:54.843 --> 14:57.228
- Come along...
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

15:02.185 --> 15:03.442
Come on!

15:06.106 --> 15:08.076
I can't see shit. Higher!

15:09.693 --> 15:10.945
Come on!

15:18.620 --> 15:19.913
Wow.

15:20.038 --> 15:23.031
We're talking maybe 20 student nurses
in varying states of undress.

15:23.125 --> 15:24.762
You should see it.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.511
Tits flying everywhere.

15:29.716 --> 15:32.397
Two nurses dancing in the nude.

15:33.261 --> 15:34.602
Wow.

15:35.013 --> 15:36.354
Come on, then, my turn.

15:41.437 --> 15:42.689
Higher...

15:43.147 --> 15:46.446
Higher... That's it.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.159
Good.

15:53.492 --> 15:54.744
I see no tits.

16:01.251 --> 16:02.758
It's Sophie.

16:10.845 --> 16:13.016
Wow. I see what you mean.

16:14.099 --> 16:15.522
What?

16:26.947 --> 16:28.715
What do you mean,
"You see what I mean?"

16:28.740 --> 16:30.580
Your girl, Sophie.

16:30.784 --> 16:33.881
The curve of that breast.
The pink nipple.

16:33.996 --> 16:35.468
Pressed against the window.

16:35.581 --> 16:37.717
You lying ponce.

16:37.917 --> 16:39.554
Yeah, right.

16:40.128 --> 16:42.098
Sophie.

16:47.470 --> 16:49.938
Don't let them get to you, Percy.

16:50.390 --> 16:52.110
They won't break me.

16:53.101 --> 16:54.904
We'll stick together.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.944
Like shit to a blanket.

17:06.407 --> 17:08.045
Who's this malingerer?

17:08.159 --> 17:10.473
- What's your name, soldier?
- Private Redmond, sir.

17:10.498 --> 17:14.042
- And why are you not saluting the officer?
- Excused saluting, sir. Hernia.

17:14.165 --> 17:16.433
Required to keep hand in pocket
to keep it in, sir.

17:16.458 --> 17:18.720
I know your type, Redmond.
You're a Skiver.

17:18.838 --> 17:22.057
Because you're an old sweat,
you think you have the measure of the Army.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.954
Well, now you've me to contend with.

17:24.011 --> 17:26.311
I'll leave this in your hands, RSM.

17:32.812 --> 17:34.615
Right, this one.

17:45.535 --> 17:47.338
Every sergeant is a suspect

17:47.454 --> 17:50.966
and so is every soldier who has access
to the Sergeants' Mess.

17:51.250 --> 17:52.975
What do I want a clock for, sir?

17:53.001 --> 17:54.912
Sure I can't even tell the time.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.897
That clock was given to one of
my predecessors by Queen Victoria

18:02.012 --> 18:04.349
after the Crimean War for valour.

18:04.723 --> 18:06.277
Valour!

18:06.600 --> 18:09.566
It has kept time in the mess
for a hundred years.

18:09.687 --> 18:12.950
Now some twit of a conscript has nicked it.

18:13.066 --> 18:15.118
Well, this is a closed camp.

18:15.485 --> 18:19.080
No one will smuggle a clock out of here.

18:19.782 --> 18:23.376
We've found it, sir,
in the back kitchen, being cleaned.

18:32.713 --> 18:35.845
Right, let's clear up this mess, Redmond,

18:36.050 --> 18:38.055
and I don't want to hear about your hernia.

18:38.177 --> 18:40.017
I'll get my broom, sir.

18:46.311 --> 18:48.233
They say he's ill, the King.

18:52.694 --> 18:56.455
If that were so, Buckingham Palace
would issue a bulletin.

18:56.698 --> 18:59.284
It has not, so he is not.

18:59.618 --> 19:01.458
Do you have any family, Sergeant Major?

19:02.788 --> 19:05.125
No, you're married to the Army.

19:05.708 --> 19:08.426
That makes the King kind of like your dad.

19:08.670 --> 19:09.963
Huh.

19:10.088 --> 19:13.766
That silly remark will result in
a charge of insolence, Sergeant Hapgood.

19:14.343 --> 19:18.566
I think he only meant it in the sense
that nuns are married to Jesus, sir.

19:18.681 --> 19:20.983
- I have a class.
- Me, too.

19:23.812 --> 19:25.817
Hey. Psst. Come here.

19:45.753 --> 19:47.011
What?

19:47.463 --> 19:49.800
Where did you get all these snouts?

19:49.977 --> 19:51.519
Lad in the NAAFI owed me a favour.

19:52.030 --> 19:53.786
Yours is a murky world, Redmond.

19:55.556 --> 19:58.985
You're my hero, Redmond.
Skiver par excellence.

19:59.268 --> 20:03.065
Yeah, well, skiving
is not a skill acquired overnight.

20:03.356 --> 20:06.820
You're only in two years.
Skiving takes longer than that.

20:06.944 --> 20:08.996
But you show promise, Percy.

20:09.947 --> 20:12.395
And how would you define
your complete Skiver, Redmond?

20:15.578 --> 20:17.215
Put it like this.

20:17.789 --> 20:20.918
Army training brainwashes you.
When you're told to get out of a trench

20:20.943 --> 20:24.407
and walk towards a machine gun
that's shooting at you, you do it.

20:24.672 --> 20:26.894
A Skiver will find a reason
to stay in the trench.

20:28.426 --> 20:30.930
You've got to be brave to be that cowardly.

20:32.597 --> 20:35.896
Wow. That is so profound, hmm?

20:36.644 --> 20:37.985
Yeah.

20:39.130 --> 20:42.070
- And how do you get on top of the officers?
- Find a weak spot.

20:42.313 --> 20:44.206
Like this young doc.

20:44.361 --> 20:46.117
Insecure, easy to con.

20:46.488 --> 20:48.873
I can get a chitty off him no bother.

20:49.074 --> 20:51.613
Everyone in the Army's
trying to get away with something.

20:51.744 --> 20:54.378
Find out what it is and play on it.

20:55.707 --> 20:58.127
Except our Bradley. A tough nut.

20:59.002 --> 21:00.544
He lives by the letter of the law.

21:00.670 --> 21:02.676
No weak spot? No chink in the armour?

21:02.965 --> 21:04.555
Not sure.

21:05.092 --> 21:06.682
Could be rage.

21:07.220 --> 21:08.857
He's a tinderbox.

21:09.555 --> 21:11.442
- I'll get him in the end.
- No.

21:12.267 --> 21:14.070
We'll do it together.

21:20.610 --> 21:22.366
Hernia still playing up, Redmond?

21:22.987 --> 21:24.239
Yes, sir. Required to...

21:24.322 --> 21:26.577
Keep hand in pocket. Yes, we know.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.832
Well, take it out and salute properly.

21:32.873 --> 21:35.508
What infraction is it this time,
Sergeant Major Bradley?

21:35.793 --> 21:38.973
Disruptive behaviour
contrary to good order, sir.

21:39.339 --> 21:42.472
What is that?
Frolicking? Messing about?

21:43.177 --> 21:44.730
Not language I would use, sir.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.976
Reprimanded, Redmond.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.857
And Sergeant Major,
try to maintain discipline

21:49.976 --> 21:51.609
without resorting to company orders.

21:51.634 --> 21:53.889
It is tiresome. Dismiss.

22:00.154 --> 22:01.577
Improperly dressed, sir.

22:02.323 --> 22:04.126
How, Sergeant Major?

22:04.492 --> 22:07.755
Did Sergeant Hapgood
come to work wearing pyjamas?

22:08.038 --> 22:09.289
Flies undone?

22:09.373 --> 22:11.010
Top jacket button, sir.

22:12.126 --> 22:14.511
Admonished, Sergeant Hapgood.

22:18.403 --> 22:21.018
What on earth is it this time,
Sergeant Major?

22:21.303 --> 22:22.596
Dumb insolence, sir.

22:23.764 --> 22:25.354
Dumb insolence?

22:25.841 --> 22:27.445
Dumb insolence?

22:28.561 --> 22:30.828
That hasn't been invoked
since the First World War.

22:31.159 --> 22:36.070
It's still an offence, sir,
under Section 83-A of the Army Act.

22:38.030 --> 22:40.284
So what did he do or not do?

22:40.699 --> 22:43.797
He refused to accept my criticism
of his work methods.

22:44.454 --> 22:45.705
Sergeant Rohan?

22:46.122 --> 22:49.478
Sergeant Major Bradley's insistence
that every letter of the law be enforced

22:49.503 --> 22:51.635
makes teaching these men
almost impossible, sir.

22:51.712 --> 22:54.049
- Guilty'?
- If silence is an offence, yes, sir.

22:54.398 --> 22:55.650
Admonished.

22:55.675 --> 22:58.356
May I remind you, sir,
that the relevant section

22:58.469 --> 23:02.480
demands a reprimand as the minimum
punishment for this offence.

23:03.725 --> 23:07.107
- Sir?
- The rest is silence.

23:12.110 --> 23:14.660
We have to stop him!
We have to bring him down.

23:14.779 --> 23:16.548
Charge him with something for a change.

23:16.574 --> 23:19.293
- It won't work. He lives by the law.
- Then let's kill him.

23:19.332 --> 23:21.919
- Murder is my...
- Favourite crime.

23:22.455 --> 23:24.460
We keep it simple.
Break into his quarters.

23:24.582 --> 23:28.545
You and Redmond hold him down.
I stuff a pillow over his face.

23:28.670 --> 23:30.892
Found dead in the morning.
No signs of a struggle.

23:30.917 --> 23:33.057
- Celebrations all around.
- I couldn't do that.

23:33.175 --> 23:35.560
Why not?
The Army's training you to kill.

23:35.586 --> 23:37.389
Get some practice in.

23:39.223 --> 23:42.273
God. Have you got a better idea?

23:46.106 --> 23:48.277
- Psychological warfare.
- What?

23:48.400 --> 23:51.167
Well, you know how he gets enraged
if his routine's disrupted.

23:51.334 --> 23:52.379
So?

23:52.405 --> 23:55.507
He does the Telegraph crossword
every lunchtime in the mess.

23:55.598 --> 23:56.750
Well?

23:56.799 --> 23:59.875
Well, one of us slips down mid-morning
and solves it. He'll go nuts.

23:59.997 --> 24:02.536
That's some leap from murder
to fucking up his crossword.

24:09.507 --> 24:12.640
This is your guide to hygiene in Korea,

24:12.761 --> 24:16.356
with nasty pictures about syphilis
and what it can do to you.

24:16.891 --> 24:20.237
We had that lecture
on our way to France in the war.

24:21.938 --> 24:27.194
The doc said, "So don't ruin your life
for 10 minutes of pleasure.

24:27.653 --> 24:29.124
"Any questions?"

24:29.238 --> 24:31.041
And one lad said, "Yes, sir.

24:31.157 --> 24:32.835
"How do you make it last 10 minutes?"

24:38.373 --> 24:41.422
While we're waiting,
take a few tips from an old sweat.

24:41.543 --> 24:45.056
Now, saluting.
This is what they tell you to do.

24:46.632 --> 24:49.350
Longest way up, shortest way down.

24:50.053 --> 24:53.102
Finish with thumb
pointing down trouser seam.

24:53.223 --> 24:56.438
Up, one, two, down, two, three.

24:57.603 --> 25:00.487
Well, you can make a statement
with saluting.

25:00.732 --> 25:04.114
This is the "fuck you, sir" salute.

25:11.869 --> 25:13.542
Silence!

25:16.207 --> 25:19.173
You are all about to posted to Korea,

25:19.795 --> 25:22.808
which is no laughing matter,
I can assure you!

25:26.761 --> 25:31.234
Sergeant Rohan will take the first
of three orientation lectures.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.020
Inciting disorder. See me in my office.

25:44.948 --> 25:46.289
Okay.

25:46.700 --> 25:50.711
This is a war between
North and South Korea.

25:52.081 --> 25:55.047
The North, supported by China and Russia,

25:55.168 --> 25:57.588
the South by America and us.

25:58.630 --> 26:02.142
And General MacArthur
is in charge of the war. Was.

26:03.302 --> 26:05.224
President Truman has just sacked him.

26:05.596 --> 26:08.861
MacArthur wasn't satisfied with driving
the Chinese back over the border.

26:08.886 --> 26:12.066
He wanted to invade China
and drop a few atom bombs on them.

26:12.604 --> 26:15.404
Wasn't he a hero
in the Second World War, Sarge?

26:15.858 --> 26:19.370
Well, yes, but like a lot of generals
in the history of war,

26:19.487 --> 26:20.910
he's probably completely nuts.

26:26.161 --> 26:29.756
Will I be typing out there, Sarge,
in a nice warm office?

26:30.290 --> 26:33.221
No, you won't, Henderson.
You're all on active duty.

26:33.461 --> 26:34.884
Even a nice gin like me?

26:38.675 --> 26:41.689
Shut up and let me tell you what to expect.

26:42.471 --> 26:46.232
Korea is pan of the war
between communism and capitalism,

26:46.475 --> 26:48.362
the so-called Cold War.

26:48.478 --> 26:51.942
And it is cold, bitterly cold,
where you'll be fighting.

26:52.941 --> 26:57.034
Unlike the Americans, you will not
be issued with special clothing.

26:57.821 --> 27:02.128
So get your mums to send you gloves
and jumpers and warm underwear.

27:03.453 --> 27:07.629
This is how we ate our grub in India.
Kills all germs.

27:07.833 --> 27:10.550
Never get Delhi belly
when your curry's this fiery.

27:14.382 --> 27:16.075
More curry for
Sergeant Hapgood, Redmond.

27:16.101 --> 27:17.359
No.

27:17.385 --> 27:19.471
- No, please, please, please.
- No?

27:19.496 --> 27:22.925
Yes. Fill his plate, Redmond.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.363
Hapgood. Eat up.

27:28.356 --> 27:30.916
- Young pup like you needs his nosh.
- It's hot.

27:30.942 --> 27:34.703
No, you don't, Redmond.
Stay right here where I can see you.

27:35.197 --> 27:37.997
You can't skive in the mess
like you did up at the centre.

27:45.041 --> 27:48.304
Never thought
I'd live to see conscripts in my mess.

27:50.005 --> 27:51.512
Whew!

27:54.218 --> 27:56.058
No, you don't. Redmond, get back here.

28:04.313 --> 28:07.446
Sophie, I need to get something straight,
something Bill told me.

28:07.566 --> 28:10.070
I didn't believe him
because I knew you wouldn't

28:10.319 --> 28:13.452
but when he was looking through
the window of your dorm, did you...

28:13.949 --> 28:15.200
Did I what?

28:16.994 --> 28:18.245
Did you...

28:18.579 --> 28:19.830
Bare my breast?

28:19.997 --> 28:22.299
Yes. Did you?

28:23.125 --> 28:24.798
What do you take me for?

28:24.919 --> 28:26.473
'- Lying shit.

28:28.507 --> 28:30.910
Hang on. How did you know
I was going to ask you that?

28:38.059 --> 28:39.613
Excuse me.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.322
I saw you at the concert

28:42.439 --> 28:44.076
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

28:44.191 --> 28:47.039
I don't mean to bother you.
It's just that...

28:47.152 --> 28:49.537
Stop apologising.
It's very unattractive.

28:49.655 --> 28:51.791
- Yes, well...
- You sat behind me.

28:51.908 --> 28:55.254
I could feel your eyes boring into me.
What do you want?

28:55.370 --> 28:58.503
I'm sorry. I just couldn't get you
out of my mind.

28:59.750 --> 29:02.716
I'm Bill, Bill Rohan,
stationed at the camp.

29:02.837 --> 29:04.593
Is it William or just Bill?

29:04.714 --> 29:07.562
Nobody ever calls me William, always Bill.

29:08.593 --> 29:10.312
I prefer William.

29:10.721 --> 29:13.818
Come in, William.
You deserve a drink for courage.

29:14.058 --> 29:15.944
So you live here?

29:16.060 --> 29:18.824
No. No, it belongs to my aunt.

29:19.314 --> 29:21.236
I'm just here having a nervous breakdown.

29:21.358 --> 29:23.445
Or so they tell me.

29:23.860 --> 29:27.622
It basically involves lying
on a couch talking about my childhood...

29:33.371 --> 29:36.468
- Am I boring you?
- No, no, sorry.

29:37.334 --> 29:39.671
Usually I'm studying in Oxford.

29:40.254 --> 29:44.644
- How old are you?
- Twenty. No... Nearly 20.

29:45.343 --> 29:46.933
And you?

29:47.053 --> 29:48.940
An older woman.

29:49.389 --> 29:50.682
Twenty-four.

29:52.517 --> 29:55.104
Don't expect anything from me, William.

29:55.980 --> 29:57.783
I'll disappoint you.

30:09.912 --> 30:11.549
Is he coming back?

30:11.747 --> 30:13.587
Oh, he went chasing after a girl.

30:13.708 --> 30:16.888
And we're stuck in a milk bar
with nowhere to go.

30:22.927 --> 30:26.106
There's a concert tomorrow.
May I take you to it?

30:26.514 --> 30:28.851
I don't know. Maybe.

30:29.184 --> 30:32.399
Perhaps I'll see you there,
if I feel well enough.

30:33.438 --> 30:36.571
As long as it's not Chopin.
Too melancholic.

30:38.277 --> 30:40.365
- Goodnight, William.
- Goodnight.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.800
What's your name?
I didn't ask your name.

30:58.300 --> 31:01.764
You fool. You stupid fool.

31:10.563 --> 31:11.905
Goodnight, soldier.

31:13.025 --> 31:16.157
Why haven't you supervised
this Sergeant Rohan?

31:16.278 --> 31:18.081
Do you check his lecture notes?

31:18.489 --> 31:20.893
You may recall, sir,
you have not been very supportive

31:20.918 --> 31:22.923
in my attempts to discipline these men.

31:23.161 --> 31:25.746
I'm not talking about
your petty infringements!

31:25.771 --> 31:27.023
This is deadly serious!

31:28.709 --> 31:32.506
This boy, Private Kitto,
has refused to go to Korea

31:32.630 --> 31:35.394
because Sergeant Rohan
says it's an immoral war.

31:35.508 --> 31:37.098
Kitto. Sounds foreign.

31:37.385 --> 31:40.814
The boys father
is a left-wing Labour MP

31:40.931 --> 31:43.316
and intends raising it in Parliament.

31:43.434 --> 31:47.575
Everyone's jumpy since Burgess and
Maclean defected to Russia last year.

31:47.772 --> 31:50.240
It's going to be all over the papers.

31:50.525 --> 31:54.238
We have to take swift action
before MI5 come down on us.

31:54.363 --> 31:56.257
We have to be seen to be doing something.

31:56.284 --> 31:57.921
- Do what?
- Well,

31:58.200 --> 32:01.166
suspend Sergeant Rohan
from duties at once, I suppose.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.043
Pending...

32:04.290 --> 32:06.830
There must be something
we can charge him with. But what?

32:07.377 --> 32:10.557
May I suggest Section 35
of the Army Act, sir?

32:10.673 --> 32:12.892
Seducing a soldier
from the course of his duty,

32:13.175 --> 32:14.599
a court martial offence.

32:14.719 --> 32:18.432
- Seducing a soldier?
- From the course of his duty.

32:24.229 --> 32:26.158
- They charge you?
- Seducing a soldier.

32:26.184 --> 32:29.286
- Seducing a soldier?
- From the course of his duty.

32:29.485 --> 32:32.535
I'm suspended, on house arrest
pending court martial.

32:37.035 --> 32:38.293
The major's gutless.

32:38.412 --> 32:40.667
Bradley's a fucking snake.

32:40.790 --> 32:42.925
That RSM is a sadistic shit.

32:45.670 --> 32:48.709
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to steal his fucking clock.

32:48.799 --> 32:50.523
Don't do that, Percy. They'll find it.

32:50.548 --> 32:52.815
You can't get it out of the camp.
They'll have you.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.574
With Redmond working in the mess,
there's a way to do this.

32:55.681 --> 32:57.905
I was supposed to meet that
girl at the concert tonight, Percy.

32:57.931 --> 33:00.289
- Would you go and explain for me?
- What's her name?

33:00.314 --> 33:01.162
I don't know.

33:01.188 --> 33:03.410
You don't know her name
but you were in her house?

33:03.440 --> 33:04.540
- Have you got her phone number?
- No.

33:04.566 --> 33:07.242
Just go to the concert
and call out, "Message from William."

33:07.280 --> 33:09.529
- Who's William?
- That's what she calls me.

33:27.717 --> 33:29.438
Come on.

33:31.555 --> 33:32.806
I'm coming.

33:33.293 --> 33:36.976
Time for a game of billiards, isn't it, lads?
Oh, what, you learn how to play?

34:10.349 --> 34:13.030
Percy, you're seriously deranged.

34:22.904 --> 34:24.328
Come in.

34:26.033 --> 34:27.918
- Did you get it?
- Get what?

34:28.369 --> 34:31.085
- You know what.
- No, I don't.

34:45.179 --> 34:46.994
Okay, Percy, you did it.
Now put it back.

34:47.018 --> 34:48.858
- Never.
- Then I will.

34:52.145 --> 34:54.447
No, you won't!

35:18.926 --> 35:20.812
Redmond, where is it?

35:21.387 --> 35:24.685
It was definitely here last night
when we knocked off, sir.

35:24.807 --> 35:27.192
- Osbourne?
- Yes, sir. It's always here.

35:27.310 --> 35:30.608
We know it's always here,
but it's not here now. Where is it?

35:30.856 --> 35:32.528
Don't know, sir.

35:35.486 --> 35:38.701
You are a tripe hound, Redmond,
a notorious Skiver.

35:38.823 --> 35:42.360
When I get to the truth of this, if I
find you there at the bottom of a barrel,

35:42.386 --> 35:45.470
in the slime where you belong,
you will wish you had never been born.

35:45.495 --> 35:48.658
You will curse your mother
for bringing you into the world.

35:56.593 --> 35:58.527
All ranks return to billets

35:58.553 --> 36:00.808
and stand by your beds.

36:01.515 --> 36:03.236
All ranks return to billets

36:03.350 --> 36:05.023
and stand by your beds.

36:06.104 --> 36:07.907
Barrack C, clear.

36:10.525 --> 36:12.577
All gates secured, sir!

36:16.031 --> 36:18.661
- Has this one been searched?
- Yes, sir.

36:18.784 --> 36:20.172
Shit.

36:27.711 --> 36:28.963
Shit.

36:34.928 --> 36:36.767
- What about this one?
- Not yet, sir.

36:57.077 --> 36:58.371
Tenpence ha' penny.

36:58.496 --> 37:00.916
Oh, God! All right.

37:02.458 --> 37:05.223
Sixpence, sevenpence, eightpence,

37:05.337 --> 37:08.137
ninepence, tenpence, ha'penny.

37:20.479 --> 37:23.908
You two, search that block there.
You two, that hut.

37:24.191 --> 37:26.243
You, search that hut. Come on.

37:29.238 --> 37:30.710
Where are you going, Hapgood?

37:30.824 --> 37:32.710
To my quarters, sir, to stand by my bed.

37:32.826 --> 37:34.463
- Do you know why'?
- No, sir.

37:34.578 --> 37:36.346
Know anything about my clock, Sergeant?

37:36.466 --> 37:38.721
I thought you found it.
Being cleaned, wasn't it?

37:38.844 --> 37:42.629
Do not trifle with me, Hapgood.
Now, get a move on! Go!

37:44.464 --> 37:47.548
- All clear here, sir.
- I've found nothing, sir.

37:53.265 --> 37:54.938
This room's clear, sir.

37:58.897 --> 38:00.238
No, nothing, sir.

38:04.987 --> 38:07.123
Out. Tip 'em out now.

38:15.499 --> 38:18.175
All soldiers
whose quarters have been searched

38:18.669 --> 38:21.220
must return to their assigned duties.

38:22.924 --> 38:26.768
- No soldier must leave the camp...
- There you go!

38:27.471 --> 38:30.650
Sergeant Major,
this search is most disruptive.

38:30.766 --> 38:32.237
We must resume training.

38:32.351 --> 38:36.148
That clock is somewhere in this camp
and I intend to find it.

38:42.321 --> 38:44.077
Open the gate. Open.

39:01.801 --> 39:03.473
Sit down, Sergeant.

39:04.804 --> 39:07.141
These gentlemen are from MI5, Sergeant.

39:07.265 --> 39:09.686
They've been studying your lecture notes.

39:09.810 --> 39:12.278
What were your sources
for these lectures, Sergeant?

39:12.563 --> 39:14.817
The London Times, sir'".

39:15.232 --> 39:16.739
All this is in The Times?

39:17.372 --> 39:18.624
Yes, sir.

39:19.195 --> 39:23.206
Even this, "How the United Nations
Bungled the Border Demarcation"?

39:23.992 --> 39:25.583
Yes, sir. The Times man was there

39:25.703 --> 39:28.088
and made a detailed report.

39:29.540 --> 39:32.764
You say that General MacArthur
may have been insane.

39:33.294 --> 39:36.807
Not me, sir. The Times.
It's in the cuttings.

39:37.174 --> 39:42.264
Never mind The Times.
Do you think Korea is an immoral war?

39:42.513 --> 39:43.765
No, sir.

39:44.056 --> 39:46.904
- You think it's a moral one?
- No, sir.

39:47.310 --> 39:49.647
- Then what is it?
- A tactical war.

39:49.938 --> 39:51.539
As I explained to the men,

39:51.940 --> 39:53.946
part of the Cold War
between the two systems.

39:53.972 --> 39:57.270
And which of these systems
do you favour, Sergeant Rohan?

39:59.282 --> 40:01.121
- Neither.
- Neither?

40:01.242 --> 40:03.627
- Neither.
- So you're not a Communist?

40:04.246 --> 40:06.500
No, sir, nor a capitalist.

40:06.957 --> 40:09.543
- Sitting on the fence.
- Yes, sir.

40:10.461 --> 40:13.427
So why do you think
this soldier refused to go to Korea

40:13.548 --> 40:15.434
after attending your lectures?

40:16.843 --> 40:20.023
It may have been the freezing
conditions I warned them of, sir.

40:22.892 --> 40:24.731
Wait outside, Sergeant.

40:30.525 --> 40:32.531
You can forget the court martial.

40:32.653 --> 40:35.157
He didn't seduce the man.

40:35.281 --> 40:37.666
Didn't even flirt with him.

40:39.202 --> 40:42.999
With respect, sir, did you not
find his answers subversive?

40:43.415 --> 40:45.716
Of course he's up to no good.

40:46.084 --> 40:50.012
But should we indict The Times,
the bible of the ruling class?

40:50.131 --> 40:51.684
You'll have to ride this one out.

40:52.842 --> 40:57.315
We have to charge the boy,
Private Kitto, for refusing an order.

40:57.681 --> 40:59.359
Major, my advice would be to bury it.

41:00.309 --> 41:05.150
Post Kitto to somewhere far away
and unpleasant.

41:05.440 --> 41:09.367
The jungles of Malaya
or up against the Mau Mau in Kenya,

41:09.486 --> 41:13.283
where he can get shot at
without troubling his conscience.

41:21.082 --> 41:24.096
Case dismissed and a 48-hour pass.

41:24.294 --> 41:27.012
Well, don't looked so chuffed.
It depresses me.

41:27.256 --> 41:30.602
- Where are you going?
- That girl. I'm going to find her.

41:31.931 --> 41:34.970
- You don't even know her name.
- I know her college in Oxford.

41:35.807 --> 41:37.314
You're nuts.

41:40.145 --> 41:41.617
We need to talk, Percy.

41:42.439 --> 41:44.361
You can talk in front of Bill.

41:48.988 --> 41:50.240
We're up shit creek, mate.

41:51.741 --> 41:55.254
Disappointed in you, Redmond.
The ultimate Skiver.

41:55.829 --> 41:57.965
I thought you'd relish this.

41:59.083 --> 42:02.382
Skivers do not take on the Army, Percy,
not head-on, they don't.

42:03.254 --> 42:05.723
They skin around it, duck under it.

42:06.591 --> 42:08.727
You think you're a Skiver.

42:08.844 --> 42:10.431
Well, skivers keep their head down.

42:11.806 --> 42:13.360
You're not a Skiver, Percy.

42:14.267 --> 42:15.690
This is not skiving.

42:16.060 --> 42:19.144
This is like sticking your head up
over the trench without a helm et.

42:19.169 --> 42:21.340
Give it back. You're both nuts.

42:21.775 --> 42:24.112
- I may never come back.
- Yes, you will.

42:24.445 --> 42:27.494
Because deep down,
or just below the surface,

42:27.615 --> 42:30.415
you are a fucking ninny.

42:32.579 --> 42:34.419
Just put it back, Percy.
They'll find it.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.590
No, they won't.

42:38.753 --> 42:41.138
The fucking RSM has me haunted.
He knows I done it.

42:41.255 --> 42:42.846
No, he doesn't.

42:42.966 --> 42:45.137
He's working me nuts off in the mess.

42:45.260 --> 42:47.146
You've dropped me in it.

42:47.262 --> 42:48.899
Just give it back, Percy.

42:49.014 --> 42:52.977
I can't. It's gone. Gone forever.

43:15.002 --> 43:17.422
The woman lies invitingly on the cushions.

43:18.714 --> 43:20.802
The man looms over her,

43:21.551 --> 43:23.936
his phallic pole
sliding through his fingers.

43:26.389 --> 43:29.902
My family live on the Thames,
downstream at Shepperton.

43:30.769 --> 43:33.320
I've been pulling punts
since I was nine years old.

43:34.106 --> 43:37.571
Pity. It was such an
attractive metaphor, William.

43:38.194 --> 43:42.075
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

43:46.454 --> 43:48.922
What would you like to do, later?

43:50.083 --> 43:52.420
Everything. Nothing.

43:59.260 --> 44:02.309
There's a film opened up called Rashomon.

44:03.348 --> 44:06.148
Everyone's talking about it.
It's a Japanese director.

44:06.726 --> 44:09.277
- Kurosawa.
- Yes.

44:10.397 --> 44:13.115
And while we're on names, what is yours?

44:14.110 --> 44:16.032
I keep meaning to ask.

44:16.946 --> 44:19.532
I think you should name me, William,

44:19.658 --> 44:21.912
seeing as you were clever
enough to find me.

44:22.494 --> 44:23.965
How about Ophelia?

44:24.830 --> 44:26.171
Why?

44:26.707 --> 44:28.297
Unhappily in love.

44:28.626 --> 44:31.212
- Suicidal.
- Why do you say that?

44:33.173 --> 44:34.680
Your eyes.

44:35.676 --> 44:37.017
Oh.

44:38.345 --> 44:41.229
- And have you come to save me?
- Of course.

45:03.582 --> 45:07.345
It's brilliant. We're shown three versions
of the same event but each one different.

45:07.376 --> 45:10.385
And which one's true? We don't know.
Completely original technique.

45:10.500 --> 45:14.599
How can you be so passionate
about something so abstract?

45:15.804 --> 45:18.853
In all the versions,
there was one constant.

45:19.141 --> 45:22.689
The woman was raped.
That's what the film was saying.

45:23.020 --> 45:26.983
It can happen in different ways
but the woman is always raped.

45:27.734 --> 45:29.953
- Were you ever?
- Raped?

45:30.946 --> 45:32.749
No, not raped.

45:33.198 --> 45:36.876
Seduced, conquered, possessed.

45:37.578 --> 45:39.880
I gave up, gave myself up.

45:40.957 --> 45:43.675
I despise him
but my body does not, it seems.

45:44.795 --> 45:46.088
Stroke.

45:46.672 --> 45:47.923
Stroke.

45:48.340 --> 45:49.634
Stroke.

45:58.060 --> 45:59.401
You let Bill see.

45:59.520 --> 46:02.023
Through the window.
That's different.

46:03.316 --> 46:08.536
God. It's so tedious having to go
through all these steps and stages.

46:08.863 --> 46:11.913
Hand on bra. Bra off.

46:12.201 --> 46:13.921
Hand on breast.

46:14.970 --> 46:16.603
We're going to get there in the end.

46:16.628 --> 46:19.344
Why delay it
with all this phoney resistance?

46:21.377 --> 46:25.056
- Okay, let's do it.
- Good. When?

46:27.721 --> 46:29.442
Now.

46:30.763 --> 46:32.851
- Right now?
- If you like.

46:36.061 --> 46:39.276
Here... Here in the open,
in the broad daylight?

46:39.607 --> 46:41.198
Why not?

46:43.900 --> 46:46.237
You've never done it, have you?

46:46.906 --> 46:48.330
Course I have.

46:48.450 --> 46:50.087
How many times?

46:50.702 --> 46:52.873
Uh...

46:55.332 --> 46:57.338
I lost count.

46:58.920 --> 47:00.473
Excuse me.

47:01.089 --> 47:02.346
Percy.

47:07.679 --> 47:09.294
What is it, Percy?

47:11.851 --> 47:13.524
I just saw a ghost.

47:20.527 --> 47:22.330
Sorry, I can't.

47:30.372 --> 47:32.342
Sorry it's such a mess

47:33.333 --> 47:34.840
but so am I.

47:41.801 --> 47:43.771
- Will he come?
- Yes.

47:45.013 --> 47:46.603
Are you sure?

47:47.015 --> 47:48.439
Yes.

47:49.977 --> 47:51.228
Then we'll wait.

47:56.192 --> 47:59.076
- Seducing a soldier?
- From the course of his duty.

47:59.488 --> 48:01.458
Are you really going to kill this Bradley?

48:02.199 --> 48:03.832
I know it sounds crazy sitting here.

48:04.452 --> 48:06.255
But there, in that camp,

48:07.580 --> 48:10.345
it feels normal, necessary.

48:11.209 --> 48:13.323
Is there nothing good you can take from it?

48:14.504 --> 48:16.640
- The Army?
- Yes.

48:18.259 --> 48:21.937
I did my basic training with these boys,
from every walk of life.

48:22.639 --> 48:24.226
We lived together in a barrack room

48:24.251 --> 48:27.071
and the more they brutalised us
and broke us down,

48:27.185 --> 48:28.906
the closer we got.

48:29.229 --> 48:32.611
We felt each other's pain,
knew each other's thoughts.

48:33.943 --> 48:37.740
None of us would ever admit it but
there was a lot of love in that room.

48:39.491 --> 48:41.128
Love and laughter.

48:42.119 --> 48:44.420
Well, one week,

48:45.790 --> 48:48.507
it was the day before pay day
and we were broke.

48:48.626 --> 48:50.984
There wasn't even a single cigarette
left between us.

48:51.337 --> 48:54.684
When we got back from training that day,
one boy, Lionel Barker,

48:54.800 --> 48:56.971
found a parcel waiting for him.

48:57.595 --> 49:00.941
We all gathered round it because
we knew that whatever else was in it,

49:01.057 --> 49:03.062
there would be a packet of cigarettes.

49:03.768 --> 49:05.939
- Oh, no.
- What's that?

49:06.479 --> 49:07.986
- Jam.
- Oh, shit.

49:08.315 --> 49:09.703
- Oh.
- Oh, God, no.

49:11.277 --> 49:14.575
Of the 20 of us,
I was the only one that didn't smoke.

49:18.410 --> 49:19.661
Gentle.

49:21.788 --> 49:24.173
Tweezers...
Give him your tweezers.

49:24.375 --> 49:26.047
Lionel... Lionel...

49:28.337 --> 49:30.140
[- {soldier 2] Easy!

49:30.340 --> 49:31.728
Yes!

49:32.258 --> 49:33.510
Yes.

49:33.760 --> 49:36.726
Like a surgeon at work.
Go on, that's it.

49:39.433 --> 49:42.114
The cravings of those 19 boys
were so intense

49:42.228 --> 49:45.242
that it somehow seeped into me,
by osmosis or something.

49:47.692 --> 49:49.283
I think they're ready.

49:50.028 --> 49:51.280
Come on, boys.

49:52.406 --> 49:54.538
- Right, they're dry.
- Yes!

49:54.575 --> 49:55.827
Come on.

49:57.036 --> 49:58.306
Give us a light.

50:06.046 --> 50:08.052
I who had never smoked,

50:08.174 --> 50:11.437
was craving a fag dying for a cigarette.

50:24.400 --> 50:26.038
So that was my first cigarette.

50:26.486 --> 50:29.500
It was pink and swollen
and strawberry-flavoured.

50:37.415 --> 50:39.752
- He hasn't turned up.
- He will.

50:39.959 --> 50:41.211
Good.

50:41.586 --> 50:43.899
You're very kind to do
this for me, William.

50:44.381 --> 50:47.146
I don't have the will to end it on my own.

50:52.090 --> 50:54.890
I know what it's like with kind men.

50:56.478 --> 50:57.729
You give,

50:58.227 --> 51:01.274
console and offer oceans of sympathy.

51:03.194 --> 51:07.370
And the girl soon finds
she has this great debt of goodness

51:07.490 --> 51:09.875
that finally needs to be rewarded.

51:12.246 --> 51:14.880
And you get what you wanted all along.

51:17.585 --> 51:21.548
On the whole,
women prefer to be seized and taken,

51:24.051 --> 51:26.554
not have their resistance worn down.

51:29.473 --> 51:31.194
Oh, William, I do like you.

51:32.685 --> 51:35.134
If I got my body back,
I would probably give it to you.

51:35.397 --> 51:37.117
Send me a postcard when it happens.

51:37.232 --> 51:39.487
Oh, please don't go, William.
I need your help.

51:43.572 --> 51:44.830
William,

51:45.742 --> 51:47.996
this is Paul, my tutor
I was telling you about.

51:48.536 --> 51:51.087
Well, William, it's time for you to leave.

51:58.798 --> 52:00.139
Paul! Stop!

52:00.425 --> 52:01.932
Don't hurt him any more.

52:06.994 --> 52:08.916
Oh, darling, oh.

52:09.518 --> 52:10.776
Paul, I'm so sorry.

52:12.689 --> 52:15.323
Are you all right?

52:19.363 --> 52:24.501
Order! O-R-D-E-R.

52:25.495 --> 52:27.464
You'll be typing like girls in no time.

52:31.251 --> 52:33.138
What are you flouncing about, Henderson?

52:33.253 --> 52:36.468
I'm still trying to type like a girl,
like you said, Sarge.

52:36.674 --> 52:38.560
Are you a Nancy boy, Henderson?

52:38.676 --> 52:40.230
No, Sarge, I'm not.

52:40.511 --> 52:42.235
But I've fucked a lot of boys who are.

52:45.308 --> 52:48.073
- Well? What happened?
- I found her.

52:48.312 --> 52:50.364
- The mysterious lady?
- Yes.

52:51.774 --> 52:54.823
- Well, how was it?
- Eventful.

52:58.073 --> 52:59.912
Come on, out with it.

53:00.284 --> 53:02.538
I fell in love, got in a fight.

53:02.647 --> 53:05.447
- Did you win?
- Won the fight, lost the girl.

53:06.341 --> 53:08.429
I don't understand them.

53:09.186 --> 53:11.192
- Women?
- Yes.

53:11.490 --> 53:13.626
I mean, no, I don't.

53:49.255 --> 53:51.011
Silence!

53:53.677 --> 53:56.805
The new Hitchcock film opened
this week, Strangers on a Train.

53:57.097 --> 53:59.365
These two guys
both have someone they want to kill.

53:59.390 --> 54:02.320
Yes, they exchange victims.
That way each would have an alibi.

54:02.645 --> 54:04.401
Exactly.

54:04.898 --> 54:07.256
Now, if we could find someone
to kill Bradley for us,

54:07.317 --> 54:09.868
I'd be happy
to kill his nagging wife for him.

54:11.739 --> 54:14.669
It's spooky.
I think he knows our thoughts.

54:15.785 --> 54:17.208
He's evil.

54:25.421 --> 54:27.889
Here, tell me about the lovely Sophie.

54:28.007 --> 54:30.475
Did you get your way with her?

54:30.969 --> 54:33.852
Well, Sophie's a nice gin, not a slapper.

54:36.058 --> 54:38.277
I have too much respect for her.

54:38.519 --> 54:41.652
Respect? You, the master of disrespect?

54:42.523 --> 54:43.947
Fuck you.

54:48.280 --> 54:50.228
- Do you hear what's he's whistling?
- Yes.

54:50.254 --> 54:51.887
We're Soldiers of the Queen, My Lad.

54:51.912 --> 54:53.778
Ah, the King must be dead.

54:56.497 --> 54:58.633
"We're soldiers of the Queen..."

54:59.459 --> 55:02.971
We're soldiers of the Queen, mylad.

55:03.088 --> 55:06.517
The Queen, my lad The Queen, my lad.

55:06.634 --> 55:09.398
We're soldiers of the Queen, mylad.

55:09.971 --> 55:12.391
Have you heard the news?
The King is dead.

55:15.727 --> 55:17.448
On whose authority?

55:17.730 --> 55:20.632
We heard this cook whistling
We're Soldiers of the Queen, My Lad,

55:20.657 --> 55:21.908
so we know.

55:24.779 --> 55:26.031
Yes.

55:26.072 --> 55:29.869
We're soldiers of the Queen, mylad.

55:31.078 --> 55:33.498
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

55:33.742 --> 55:36.840
And based on this whistling cook,

55:37.126 --> 55:42.430
you countenance this rumour,
this seditious rumour,

55:43.011 --> 55:47.104
a rumour concerning our monarch,
a false rumour, Sergeant.

55:47.365 --> 55:49.086
If the King were dead,

55:49.501 --> 55:51.838
the regimental flag
would be flying at half-mast.

55:51.921 --> 55:54.733
Take a look out of the window.
Is the flag flying at half-mast?

55:54.759 --> 55:58.390
He's dead. He never wanted
to be King and now he isn't.

55:59.529 --> 56:03.954
Did you or did you not sign
an oath of allegiance to the King

56:04.034 --> 56:06.004
when you joined the Army, Sergeant?

56:06.104 --> 56:08.572
I didn't join. I was conscripted.

56:08.923 --> 56:12.886
Have you no respect for the King,
for the Army, for your country,

56:13.020 --> 56:15.025
or do you save all your respect

56:15.179 --> 56:17.564
for that little floozy you run around with?

56:23.054 --> 56:27.017
You have less than a year to serve,
Sergeant Hapgood.

56:27.142 --> 56:31.283
An assault would cost you an extra
six months in military prison!

56:31.397 --> 56:33.236
Next time I will kill you.

56:39.864 --> 56:43.080
I know you fought in the war,
the war against fascism,

56:43.202 --> 56:45.650
though it's hard to think of you
being against fascism.

56:46.372 --> 56:48.175
And maybe you were a hero.

56:48.624 --> 56:50.380
Did you shoot Germans?

56:50.585 --> 56:53.468
Was your best friend killed?
Did you lose the woman you loved?

56:53.630 --> 56:55.718
Though it takes a supreme
act of imagination

56:55.841 --> 56:58.973
to think of you loving anyone
or anything except the Army.

56:59.887 --> 57:02.106
I am sorry for you, Sergeant Major Bradley.

57:02.390 --> 57:04.062
You are a pathetic figure.

57:05.185 --> 57:07.407
And I want you to know
that what you said to Percy

57:07.432 --> 57:09.817
amounts to a declaration of war.

57:10.732 --> 57:15.657
You are weak, Sergeant Rohan,
because you lack conviction.

57:18.616 --> 57:20.752
I have nothing to fear from you.

57:42.935 --> 57:44.905
Private Redmond.

57:45.188 --> 57:47.592
As you know, a little twerp
has refused to go to Korea

57:47.617 --> 57:50.381
after listening to Sergeant Rohan's
little fucking talks.

57:51.320 --> 57:55.543
Well, that means we're a man short,
so I've put you in to fill the hole.

57:56.158 --> 57:59.374
Meanwhile, you can trot off back
to the centre, pending your posting.

58:03.041 --> 58:05.722
Of course, if that clock were to turn up,

58:05.836 --> 58:08.601
well, things might be different.

58:26.192 --> 58:29.656
- Did they leave you off, Redmond?
- Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

58:30.739 --> 58:33.503
Well, I'll make sure
you're in the next batch.

58:39.415 --> 58:40.673
Can I come in, Percy?

58:42.377 --> 58:43.884
Your fucking head's already in.

58:47.257 --> 58:50.355
- You wanted to see me?
- I thought you were off to Korea?

58:50.803 --> 58:52.643
It's still hanging over me.

58:54.474 --> 58:58.271
I've been perusing Bradley’s bible,
the Army Act.

58:58.604 --> 59:00.609
I think we might hoist him
on his own petard.

59:01.357 --> 59:02.608
What? Hang him?

59:07.572 --> 59:09.791
Listen to this.

59:10.075 --> 59:13.338
"It is an offence for an NCO
to admonish another NCO

59:13.454 --> 59:15.541
in the presence of a private soldier."

59:15.956 --> 59:17.463
So?

59:19.001 --> 59:22.051
Here's what we do.
Percy and I provoke him into a rant

59:22.172 --> 59:24.303
and you slip into the room
without him noticing.

59:24.328 --> 59:27.259
And we charge him and march him
down to Major fucking Cross.

59:28.679 --> 59:30.233
So what do I get out of it?

59:31.432 --> 59:32.986
You get Bradley off your back.

59:34.310 --> 59:36.481
If you were to get the RSM
off me back, Percy...

59:40.442 --> 59:42.737
- And how would I do that?
- You fucking know how.

59:42.764 --> 59:44.295
- Say it, Redmond.
- Give it back.

59:44.322 --> 59:47.419
- Give what back?
- The clock, the fucking clock.

59:51.913 --> 59:56.553
Well, let's get rid of Bradley
and then we'll see about the RSM.

59:57.128 --> 59:59.097
You can trust me.

01:00:00.548 --> 01:00:03.016
- Sergeant Rohan?
- Yes?

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:08.400
At the gate, Sarge.

01:00:16.983 --> 01:00:20.661
William, I didn't know how else
to reach you. I'm staying with my aunt.

01:00:21.113 --> 01:00:23.664
- What do you want?
- To say sorry.

01:00:24.992 --> 01:00:26.244
I'm so sorry.

01:00:26.619 --> 01:00:29.585
- For what?
- For ruining your 48-hour pass.

01:00:31.583 --> 01:00:34.347
Everything. What a bitch!
Can you forgive me?

01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:36.666
Can you let me out
for a few minutes, please?

01:00:36.691 --> 01:00:39.009
No, Sarge.
I took a risk in coming to get you.

01:00:39.133 --> 01:00:42.480
It meant leaving my post.
Can't open the gate.

01:00:50.729 --> 01:00:52.569
I go on leave tomorrow.

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:54.821
Come with me, to my parents'.

01:00:55.693 --> 01:00:57.449
And my sister's back from Canada.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:01:01.618
I can't, William.
I can meet you in a couple of days.

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:05.626
- What's their telephone number?
- They don't have a phone.

01:01:06.038 --> 01:01:08.969
- They don't have a phone?
- No one I know has a phone.

01:01:10.376 --> 01:01:12.263
I'll give you the address.

01:01:12.546 --> 01:01:16.473
- The Sphinx...
- Sphinx? Like in Egypt?

01:01:17.176 --> 01:01:19.680
The Sphinx, Pharaoh's Island, Shepperton.

01:01:20.179 --> 01:01:22.220
Pharaoh's Island?
Are you kidding?

01:01:22.432 --> 01:01:25.149
No. Ring the bell.

01:01:29.565 --> 01:01:30.816
Billy!

01:01:33.569 --> 01:01:36.250
Billy! Look at you!

01:01:37.115 --> 01:01:39.200
You were a skinny
little 9-year-old when I left

01:01:39.225 --> 01:01:40.998
and now you're a big sexy man.

01:01:41.119 --> 01:01:44.022
Stop with the kisses. I preferred it
when you used to beat me up.

01:01:44.047 --> 01:01:44.999
Yeah, I hated you.

01:01:45.207 --> 01:01:47.837
I was an only child for eight years
and then you turned up.

01:01:47.862 --> 01:01:49.998
- I wanted to kill you.
- Sorry.

01:01:50.755 --> 01:01:52.428
Come on. Come on, Bill!

01:01:54.926 --> 01:01:56.896
Mum, Bill's here.

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:01.268
- Oh, Bill, you're home!
- Hello, Mum.

01:02:01.392 --> 01:02:02.643
Oh!

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:04.858
- Look at you.
- I've missed you.

01:02:04.979 --> 01:02:06.231
- Come in.
- Look at her.

01:02:06.314 --> 01:02:08.117
I haven't missed you at all.

01:02:08.567 --> 01:02:11.699
Come and sit. Come and sit.
Come and sit. Oh! My darling.

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:13.458
- Oh, Bill.
- Hello, Dad.

01:02:13.864 --> 01:02:17.079
Bill... Grace, where did I leave
those newspapers?

01:02:17.201 --> 01:02:19.538
Oh, where you left them.

01:02:20.247 --> 01:02:25.716
I was mortified. My own son named
and shamed in these newspapers.

01:02:25.836 --> 01:02:29.135
- Shamed.
- What is it? "Seducing."

01:02:29.257 --> 01:02:31.524
"Seducing a soldier
from the course of his duties."

01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:32.526
Seducing?

01:02:32.552 --> 01:02:34.638
Are you saying
that my grandson's a homosexual?

01:02:34.813 --> 01:02:35.857
Oh...

01:02:36.067 --> 01:02:39.313
- A nine-bob note?
- Of course not, Dada.

01:02:39.852 --> 01:02:42.356
I... I mean, look at it.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.236
Look at it.

01:02:45.233 --> 01:02:48.531
Do you know how humiliating it is

01:02:49.071 --> 01:02:50.993
for a man who fought in two world wars?

01:02:51.115 --> 01:02:52.838
Except you didn't actually fight, Dad.

01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:55.086
- I rode into battle.
- With a drawn sword.

01:02:55.411 --> 01:02:57.831
- Leading my Gurkhas.
- Against the Turks.

01:02:57.956 --> 01:02:59.462
It was a suicide mission.

01:02:59.666 --> 01:03:01.338
Except the Turks had skedaddled.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.486
They were terrified of facing the Gurkhas.

01:03:03.511 --> 01:03:06.062
Or was it Dad on his horse
who made them run?

01:03:06.841 --> 01:03:10.851
And as for the Second World War,
you were stationed up North,

01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:13.391
some place the Luftwaffe
had never heard of,

01:03:13.515 --> 01:03:15.935
while we were in London
getting bombed every night.

01:03:16.268 --> 01:03:19.234
Well, I'm a patriot.
Bill is clearly not.

01:03:19.355 --> 01:03:21.360
- I was exonerated, Dad.
- Oh.

01:03:21.649 --> 01:03:25.446
So, you're not... You're not
a Nancy boy after all.

01:03:25.737 --> 01:03:28.585
Yeah, well, those two spies are,
Burgess and Maclean.

01:03:28.698 --> 01:03:31.997
Buggery and skulduggery
go hand-in-hand.

01:03:32.119 --> 01:03:33.840
I don't suppose

01:03:33.954 --> 01:03:36.968
either of you are interested
in the Coronation?

01:03:37.083 --> 01:03:39.847
Well, I am and so is Grace.

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:42.190
- Don't...
- I've bought

01:03:42.339 --> 01:03:45.388
one of these television things
to watch it on.

01:03:45.843 --> 01:03:49.307
And unless it's against your principles,

01:03:49.931 --> 01:03:53.728
I would be very grateful
for a hand setting it up.

01:03:55.812 --> 01:03:57.366
- How about this?
- Stop.

01:03:57.481 --> 01:03:59.652
That's too far. Back a bit.

01:04:00.734 --> 01:04:02.206
- A little more.
- There?

01:04:03.195 --> 01:04:06.079
No. No, go South.

01:04:06.199 --> 01:04:07.967
South. You have to turn it south, Bill.

01:04:09.244 --> 01:04:11.000
No, no, no. Go back, back.

01:04:11.413 --> 01:04:13.798
- You've got to go back.
- That it?

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:18.757
That's it. No. No.
We're talking subtle increments here.

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:21.936
That's too much, that's too much,
Bill. We're talking subtle,

01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:23.687
subtle increments, okay?

01:04:23.969 --> 01:04:27.101
- Subtle increments?
- To the south.

01:04:27.514 --> 01:04:29.899
No, back. Okay, back, back.

01:04:30.768 --> 01:04:32.856
There we are.
Hold it! Hold it. We've almost...

01:04:32.979 --> 01:04:35.198
Oh, blast. We've lost it.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.781
You've lost it, Bill!

01:04:37.025 --> 01:04:38.295
- There?
- Great!

01:04:38.321 --> 01:04:39.745
- Keep it there.
- Yeah?

01:04:40.254 --> 01:04:41.633
- You sure?
- Hold it.

01:04:41.659 --> 01:04:43.452
Hold it. There we are. There we are.

01:04:43.574 --> 01:04:46.368
We've got a picture, Bill. You did it!

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.928
Here's my friend Percy.
He's come in a red sportscar.

01:04:52.042 --> 01:04:53.335
Would you fetch him, Dawn?

01:05:04.264 --> 01:05:05.557
Hello!

01:05:19.239 --> 01:05:21.920
The crowned heads of Europe
continue to arrive in London

01:05:22.368 --> 01:05:25.500
for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

01:05:25.746 --> 01:05:27.549
Preparations continue

01:05:27.665 --> 01:05:31.213
and the Golden Coach has been put
through its paces up and down The Mail.

01:05:31.336 --> 01:05:33.785
So, where did you get
that beautiful sports car, Percy?

01:05:33.810 --> 01:05:35.061
I stole it.

01:05:35.215 --> 01:05:37.636
But I'll return it
before the owner gets back.

01:05:38.094 --> 01:05:39.482
Percy has no conscience.

01:05:39.804 --> 01:05:41.244
It's supposed to prick you,
but it never does...

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:42.857
- What?
- But it never does.

01:05:42.883 --> 01:05:45.434
Don't you feel even a twinge of guilt
about the owner?

01:05:45.553 --> 01:05:47.528
God, no. I rather resent him.

01:05:47.646 --> 01:05:48.987
Please.

01:05:49.231 --> 01:05:52.826
The tank was nearly empty and I had
to fill it up with my own money.

01:05:53.294 --> 01:05:54.545
Shh!

01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:55.822
Shh!

01:06:04.248 --> 01:06:07.214
Blue

01:06:08.628 --> 01:06:11.677
Moon.

01:06:13.425 --> 01:06:16.558
You saw me standing alone.

01:06:17.304 --> 01:06:20.686
So, have you guys got girlfriends?

01:06:23.186 --> 01:06:25.357
Son of but...

01:06:26.189 --> 01:06:28.325
she lives in a hospital, I live in a camp.

01:06:28.442 --> 01:06:31.657
We have nowhere to go.
We end up in the wet grass.

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:35.454
Making love?

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:40.417
- Conditions are never quite right.
- What?

01:06:40.622 --> 01:06:43.553
I would do it anywhere at your age,
well, younger than you.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:47.049
Wet grass, in the rain, against a wall.

01:06:47.171 --> 01:06:48.512
And look what happened.

01:06:48.631 --> 01:06:50.850
You got knocked up at 17
and shamed your family.

01:06:50.967 --> 01:06:54.100
It was the war. Do it quick
before a bomb drops on your head.

01:06:54.221 --> 01:06:56.191
It was urgent.

01:06:58.267 --> 01:06:59.525
- Billy.
- No.

01:06:59.852 --> 01:07:01.145
Yes.

01:07:01.896 --> 01:07:04.862
And you, Billy boy? Have you got a girl?

01:07:04.983 --> 01:07:07.320
Kind of. You'll meet her tomorrow.

01:07:07.611 --> 01:07:11.242
Tomorrow? What does "kind of" mean?

01:07:11.490 --> 01:07:13.460
It's complicated.

01:07:17.747 --> 01:07:20.713
- She's in love with someone else and...
- Oh...

01:07:20.834 --> 01:07:23.338
she's turning Bill inside-out.

01:07:23.462 --> 01:07:24.713
Billy.

01:07:24.964 --> 01:07:26.767
And she's really old.

01:07:27.133 --> 01:07:30.645
- What? Old like me?
- Not as old as that.

01:07:32.472 --> 01:07:35.438
I am going for a swim.

01:07:35.559 --> 01:07:37.896
The moon had turned to gold.

01:07:40.648 --> 01:07:42.202
- Blue moon.
- Come on, boys!

01:07:42.316 --> 01:07:44.452
Don't be boring!

01:07:46.237 --> 01:07:49.666
Now I'm no Langer alone.
- Whoo!

01:08:33.457 --> 01:08:35.545
- Is Dawn not up yet?
- No.

01:08:35.792 --> 01:08:37.763
- Percy?
- Still in bed.

01:08:39.631 --> 01:08:42.182
I'm worried about Dawn, Billy.

01:08:42.591 --> 01:08:45.725
She came for a holiday but
I don't think she intends to go back.

01:08:45.845 --> 01:08:48.265
She wouldn't abandon the children.

01:09:00.237 --> 01:09:02.233
Was that Mac
you were waving to this morning?

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:07.915
- You saw him?
- And you.

01:09:08.787 --> 01:09:10.461
Waving.

01:09:11.416 --> 01:09:13.885
- Do you still see him?
- No.

01:09:15.462 --> 01:09:17.764
We never meet.

01:09:18.006 --> 01:09:19.977
We wave.

01:09:20.218 --> 01:09:22.188
Just wave.

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:28.022
I'm sorry, Billy.

01:09:28.685 --> 01:09:32.234
It was the war. We all did silly things.

01:09:32.357 --> 01:09:34.023
I was 10.

01:09:34.581 --> 01:09:37.357
Do I betray my mother
or do I betray my father?

01:09:42.118 --> 01:09:44.038
On, Billy.

01:09:45.997 --> 01:09:48.252
It's so good to have you home.

01:10:01.890 --> 01:10:04.275
You can go. Be back in an hour.

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:14.414
Ophelia!

01:10:27.085 --> 01:10:29.635
Wow. She's elegant, all right.

01:10:35.511 --> 01:10:38.560
Look at the way she stepped
into the boat. It's not easy.

01:10:39.307 --> 01:10:42.237
Well, William.
You really do live on an island.

01:10:46.315 --> 01:10:48.402
She has a great body.

01:10:48.609 --> 01:10:51.457
I'm beginning to see why Bill keeps at it.

01:10:51.737 --> 01:10:57.373
Yeah, she's... She's beautiful
but she's not... sensual.

01:10:59.871 --> 01:11:01.343
How can you tell that?

01:11:01.874 --> 01:11:03.784
Oh, because when you're sensual yourself,

01:11:03.810 --> 01:11:06.279
you can always tell
if it's missing in someone else.

01:11:08.464 --> 01:11:09.888
Oh.

01:11:17.683 --> 01:11:19.854
Yeah, no, she hasn't got it.

01:11:21.896 --> 01:11:24.067
The full welcome.

01:11:24.316 --> 01:11:26.653
Is this the first time
you've brought a girl home?

01:11:27.277 --> 01:11:29.199
You're so beautiful.

01:11:30.531 --> 01:11:32.002
Thank you for coming.

01:11:35.745 --> 01:11:37.881
Class written all over her.

01:11:38.081 --> 01:11:41.463
What can a woman like that see in Bill?

01:11:41.794 --> 01:11:43.087
Bit old.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.434
Hi! Hello.

01:11:49.469 --> 01:11:52.566
How lovely. Ophelia, isn't it?

01:11:52.806 --> 01:11:54.776
It can be.

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:58.031
I hope you'll watch the coronation with us.

01:11:58.145 --> 01:12:01.242
Oh, sadly, I can't.
I'm being picked up in an hour.

01:12:02.025 --> 01:12:03.448
- Oh...

01:12:03.651 --> 01:12:05.657
Oh, well. Come in.

01:12:07.155 --> 01:12:09.125
"I'm being
picked up in an hour."

01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:11.329
I'm sorry.

01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:20.254
Stop it. So...
So, what do you, uh, study at Oxford?

01:12:20.796 --> 01:12:22.349
Philosophy.

01:12:23.549 --> 01:12:25.934
Does that help you understand life?

01:12:26.677 --> 01:12:29.774
On the contrary, the more I read,
the less I understand.

01:12:30.682 --> 01:12:31.933
Oh.

01:12:32.392 --> 01:12:36.236
See, I thought it was supposed
to, um, guide your behaviour, you know?

01:12:36.522 --> 01:12:40.532
I'm amazed at how people do behave.
Aren't you Dawn?

01:12:43.238 --> 01:12:44.958
All the time.

01:12:45.365 --> 01:12:48.462
I find my own behaviour
impossible to understand.

01:12:50.287 --> 01:12:53.799
- What about Bill's behaviour?
- Oh, yes.

01:12:55.334 --> 01:12:56.592
William...

01:12:57.253 --> 01:12:59.508
- William?
- Yes, William.

01:13:00.006 --> 01:13:02.343
I take him seriously.
I take his name seriously.

01:13:02.593 --> 01:13:04.645
Stop quizzing the poor girl.

01:13:05.095 --> 01:13:06.852
I'm sorry, Ophelia,

01:13:06.972 --> 01:13:11.196
but we islanders are so fascinated
by people from the mainland.

01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:15.743
Oh, come on.

01:13:15.941 --> 01:13:18.955
And the Queen will pass

01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:24.584
as they move in slow procession
through the aisle of the abbey...

01:13:26.161 --> 01:13:28.961
What other nation
could put on a pageant like this?

01:13:30.958 --> 01:13:33.177
There's hope in it.

01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:38.098
We're entering a new Elizabethan age.

01:13:38.216 --> 01:13:40.138
God forbid.

01:13:40.552 --> 01:13:44.313
The first Elizabeth murdered her cousin,

01:13:44.431 --> 01:13:47.279
persecuted Catholics and died a virgin.

01:13:47.393 --> 01:13:49.730
Oh, shut up, Dada.

01:13:51.064 --> 01:13:54.029
Oh, that poor, sweet girl.

01:13:54.150 --> 01:13:56.370
She's Dawn's age.

01:13:56.486 --> 01:13:58.492
She has to take on a life of duty.

01:13:58.697 --> 01:14:01.996
And she'll never have to
draw a curtain or draw a bath

01:14:02.451 --> 01:14:04.421
or squeeze her own toothpaste.

01:14:04.871 --> 01:14:09.297
Our queen deserves a few small
comforts to help her through it.

01:14:10.752 --> 01:14:12.722
God bless her.

01:14:14.882 --> 01:14:18.062
I agree. It's all quite lovely.

01:14:18.498 --> 01:14:21.215
- They're all Germans.
- Oh!

01:14:21.487 --> 01:14:23.971
The Kaiser was Queen Victoria's nephew.

01:14:24.242 --> 01:14:26.828
Now they call themselves Windsor.

01:14:26.854 --> 01:14:28.859
Windsor my arse!

01:14:28.981 --> 01:14:33.039
Windsor is a brown soup
or a way to knot your tie.

01:14:33.153 --> 01:14:35.158
It is not a royal line.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.531
Have some respect, George.

01:14:36.615 --> 01:14:38.287
It's all medieval mumbo jumbo.

01:14:38.408 --> 01:14:40.710
They're calling on God to anoint them.

01:14:40.828 --> 01:14:43.711
"The divine right of kings."

01:14:43.998 --> 01:14:45.671
Tradition.

01:14:46.584 --> 01:14:49.384
Do not underestimate the
power of tradition.

01:14:49.504 --> 01:14:51.001
It doesn't matter. It's harmless.

01:14:51.026 --> 01:14:53.723
Why get so worked up about it?
It's just fun.

01:14:53.926 --> 01:14:55.314
Oh! It's Ophelia!

01:14:55.803 --> 01:14:58.022
- I saw Ophelia!
- It can't be.

01:14:58.489 --> 01:14:59.741
It was her.

01:14:59.766 --> 01:15:01.937
Look! Look! There she is again.

01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:03.353
- There.
- It is. It is.

01:15:07.024 --> 01:15:09.325
- What's her family name?
- I don't know.

01:15:09.652 --> 01:15:12.915
You don't know? What? Are you witless?

01:15:14.491 --> 01:15:16.911
I don't even know her first name.
It's not Ophelia.

01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:20.836
History will be written
and sung hem today...

01:15:22.124 --> 01:15:25.471
I've got to get that car back
before the end of the ceremony.

01:15:25.586 --> 01:15:27.556
The owner's also in the abbey.

01:15:33.011 --> 01:15:37.188
Billy, why are you against everything?

01:15:37.808 --> 01:15:39.648
Like what?

01:15:39.894 --> 01:15:43.489
Like the Army, the war, royalty,

01:15:43.607 --> 01:15:45.908
the Tories, the class system, God,

01:15:45.934 --> 01:15:47.904
Dad's patriotism.

01:15:48.445 --> 01:15:50.996
So, what are you for?

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.447
- What are you for?
- Me?

01:15:54.018 --> 01:15:58.325
Life, love, freedom, adventure.

01:15:58.874 --> 01:16:01.010
Does that include flirting with Percy?

01:16:03.671 --> 01:16:07.432
It's interesting that you choose
a friend with no morals or scruples.

01:16:07.675 --> 01:16:10.310
That way you owe him nothing,
like no commitment.

01:16:10.554 --> 01:16:14.896
And this girl, you're entranced by her.

01:16:16.268 --> 01:16:19.502
She's in love with someone else, unhappily.

01:16:19.587 --> 01:16:22.875
Probably married.
And you think you have to protect her,

01:16:22.901 --> 01:16:26.164
like you protected Mother
when she was having it off with Mac.

01:16:26.989 --> 01:16:30.086
And because Ophelia is not free,

01:16:30.409 --> 01:16:33.375
you're free to yearn for her.

01:16:35.331 --> 01:16:37.882
That girl needs a rock, not a wet rag.

01:16:38.001 --> 01:16:39.508
For God's sake, stop.

01:16:40.671 --> 01:16:42.723
And leave me alone.

01:16:43.048 --> 01:16:45.683
You look at yourself.
Your marriage is messed up,

01:16:46.761 --> 01:16:49.479
you left your kids behind.
Don't lecture me.

01:16:49.764 --> 01:16:52.366
Sorry, Billy. Come and sit down.

01:16:52.392 --> 01:16:55.525
- I promise I'll be nice.
- You don't know how.

01:17:01.527 --> 01:17:04.625
My darling, dopey little brother.

01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:11.341
Do you know, Mum and Mac...

01:17:11.455 --> 01:17:13.211
Do they still see each other?

01:17:13.583 --> 01:17:18.471
No. But they wave to each other
across the river.

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.975
- Every day, they just wave.
- Oh.

01:17:24.136 --> 01:17:26.142
That's quite touching.

01:17:30.977 --> 01:17:32.899
Their affair...

01:17:34.565 --> 01:17:36.700
That's her guilt, not yours.

01:17:38.903 --> 01:17:42.783
You should have told Dad instead of
bottling it up for all these years.

01:17:42.991 --> 01:17:44.711
I couldn't.

01:17:45.243 --> 01:17:47.379
You don't think he knew at some level?

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:51.718
I don't know.

01:18:08.811 --> 01:18:11.078
You're mine now,
for the next two years!

01:18:11.103 --> 01:18:11.904
Left, right!

01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:15.777
Well, it's not the first time I've
had to correct you in this matter.

01:18:15.903 --> 01:18:19.415
When teaching illiterates,
you will use the words in the manual,

01:18:19.532 --> 01:18:21.667
not frivolous ones that pop into your head.

01:18:21.784 --> 01:18:23.870
You're not teaching them
to write letters home.

01:18:23.895 --> 01:18:26.508
You're teaching them
to understand orders, Army orders.

01:18:26.623 --> 01:18:28.711
I will remind you of the words in question.

01:18:28.834 --> 01:18:32.382
"Orders, regiment, sir, company, posting,

01:18:32.505 --> 01:18:36.765
"Sergeant, corporal, officer,
report obey."

01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:39.231
Yes, obey.

01:18:39.346 --> 01:18:43.143
That seems to be a word not in
your vocabulary, let alone in theirs.

01:18:43.267 --> 01:18:46.905
Teaching them words to write a letter home
motivates them to learn to read, sir.

01:18:47.021 --> 01:18:48.492
You will do as you are ordered.

01:18:48.606 --> 01:18:52.237
I'm sick to death
of your rigid fucking rants, sir.

01:18:52.944 --> 01:18:56.159
You are a nasty little subversive.

01:18:56.281 --> 01:18:59.093
You think you're clever. You think
you're better than the Army.

01:18:59.118 --> 01:19:02.000
You are vermin!
You have infested this centre.

01:19:02.121 --> 01:19:04.672
You are disruptive, rabid, rancid!

01:19:04.791 --> 01:19:07.508
You have brought anarchy to this centre!

01:19:08.712 --> 01:19:10.266
Should I be hearing all this, sir?

01:19:13.676 --> 01:19:14.933
Section 73.

01:19:15.052 --> 01:19:20.024
An NCO shall not admonish another NCO
in the presence of a private soldier.

01:19:21.852 --> 01:19:25.067
Are you party to this tawdry affair,
Sergeant Rohan?

01:19:36.868 --> 01:19:38.755
Well, this is a surprise.

01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:42.546
Admonishing an NCO
in the presence of a private soldier.

01:19:43.668 --> 01:19:46.717
A serious offence, contrary to good order.

01:19:47.797 --> 01:19:49.793
Do you admit to this,
Sergeant Major Bradley?

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:51.852
- Entrapment, sir.
- What?

01:19:51.969 --> 01:19:55.398
- Entrapment, sir.
- Entrapment?

01:19:56.641 --> 01:19:58.397
Is that covered in the Army Act?

01:19:58.893 --> 01:20:00.798
Well, you know it backwards.
Is it in here?

01:20:01.187 --> 01:20:03.323
- No, sir.
- Then guilty.

01:20:07.862 --> 01:20:11.125
My record is unblemished.

01:20:12.283 --> 01:20:16.792
I've obeyed the law to the letter,
every iota correct in every respect.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:19.928
I'm what the Army Act
intended a soldier to be.

01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:24.757
The moral high ground is mine.
It's mine.

01:20:24.881 --> 01:20:27.515
I tell you, I'm what a soldier's
supposed to be.

01:20:27.634 --> 01:20:30.683
The Army is me. I am the Army.

01:20:30.887 --> 01:20:35.360
Land the Army are indivisible to a tee.

01:20:37.436 --> 01:20:39.489
You, sir, you fudge and prevaricate.

01:20:39.731 --> 01:20:42.317
You betray your commission
in your quest for easement...

01:20:42.442 --> 01:20:44.438
That is quite enough,
Sergeant Major Bradley.

01:20:44.463 --> 01:20:46.385
You're digging a hole for yourself.

01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:50.588
Relieved of duties. Confined to quarters

01:20:50.993 --> 01:20:52.999
pending psychological assessment.

01:20:59.837 --> 01:21:02.471
I didn't think he would fall apart.

01:21:02.673 --> 01:21:05.058
The only thing I regret
is we took the easy way.

01:21:05.176 --> 01:21:06.849
We should have killed the bollocks.

01:21:06.970 --> 01:21:08.477
We've wrecked his life, Percy.

01:21:12.392 --> 01:21:15.490
Have you seen this?
Invitation to the regimental ball.

01:21:15.855 --> 01:21:18.358
"Officers and their ladies,
NCOs and their wives,

01:21:18.483 --> 01:21:20.452
"other ranks and their women."

01:21:22.779 --> 01:21:25.164
It actually says that in cold print.

01:21:25.282 --> 01:21:26.836
I thought you were making it up.

01:21:28.202 --> 01:21:30.788
There's no mention of skivers
and their slappers.

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.670
Get your feet off Bradley's desk.

01:21:32.999 --> 01:21:34.838
Aint's his no more.

01:21:35.335 --> 01:21:37.387
Clean up the place. It's a shambles.

01:21:37.671 --> 01:21:38.922
Okay, Sarge.

01:21:45.847 --> 01:21:47.400
Come on, do it.

01:21:50.101 --> 01:21:52.985
All in good time, Percy.
Will you have a beer?

01:21:53.397 --> 01:21:54.951
Just get on with it.

01:21:57.818 --> 01:22:01.663
I thought when I got rid of Bradley for you
we could all take it nice and easy.

01:22:02.657 --> 01:22:04.247
Clean up. That's an order.

01:22:04.743 --> 01:22:06.665
We're all in this together, Percy.

01:22:12.835 --> 01:22:14.805
Here she is, Bill.

01:22:17.674 --> 01:22:20.392
Well, hello.

01:22:20.594 --> 01:22:21.887
Thank you.

01:22:23.347 --> 01:22:27.405
Sophie, this used to be Ophelia.
And this is Sophie, Percy's friend.

01:22:28.019 --> 01:22:29.941
Breast at the window.

01:22:30.271 --> 01:22:32.692
Do you tell everyone?

01:22:35.861 --> 01:22:40.417
So, Helen Montague, your cover is blown.

01:22:41.159 --> 01:22:45.419
Pity. Anonymity
was the basis of our relati...

01:22:47.457 --> 01:22:49.629
Ophelia was a much nicer girl than Helen.

01:22:50.669 --> 01:22:53.256
And like Ophelia,
you ended up in the lily pond.

01:22:53.673 --> 01:22:55.643
Not quite.

01:22:56.426 --> 01:22:58.396
- Have you seen Sunset...
- Boulevard?

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:01.900
I was first in the queue.
Great movie. Billy Wilder.

01:23:02.349 --> 01:23:05.897
That was me, face down
in the swimming pool,

01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:08.784
living my life in flashback
like William Holden.

01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:11.111
- All because of Paul?
- No.

01:23:13.111 --> 01:23:15.496
He got me out of myself.

01:23:15.781 --> 01:23:17.786
He broke through.

01:23:18.617 --> 01:23:21.038
Now I'm back in this awful shell.

01:23:22.372 --> 01:23:26.963
It's like living underwater.
Everything is muffled and far away.

01:23:27.711 --> 01:23:28.969
I'm here.

01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:31.593
Thank you, William.

01:23:32.466 --> 01:23:34.472
I said I'd save you and I will.

01:23:35.970 --> 01:23:37.228
How, William?

01:23:37.972 --> 01:23:39.693
With love.

01:23:39.808 --> 01:23:41.979
Oh?

01:23:43.103 --> 01:23:46.187
I love you. I fell in love with the
back of your head at that concert

01:23:46.232 --> 01:23:47.483
I will always love you!

01:23:49.319 --> 01:23:52.831
God, William, can't you see I'm an invalid?

01:23:55.492 --> 01:23:59.206
I am going to marry a sweet, dull man

01:23:59.330 --> 01:24:02.011
who will never overexcite me.

01:24:05.503 --> 01:24:07.639
I liked your sister, William.

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:11.095
I wish I was more like her.

01:24:12.136 --> 01:24:15.233
A free spirit, spontaneous.

01:24:19.603 --> 01:24:21.026
Goodbye, William.

01:24:25.484 --> 01:24:27.454
I'm so tired.

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.930
What is it, Bill?

01:24:46.174 --> 01:24:47.728
Oh, Bill.

01:24:51.054 --> 01:24:53.024
Stay in here for a bit.

01:25:44.197 --> 01:25:46.167
I'm sorry.

01:25:47.076 --> 01:25:49.377
- It was lovely.
- You are beautiful.

01:26:03.010 --> 01:26:05.431
Look. You've stopped trembling.

01:26:06.055 --> 01:26:07.942
Oh, God. Percy.

01:26:08.183 --> 01:26:13.356
Oh, pooey. It's my duty as a nurse.
I was giving first aid.

01:26:14.273 --> 01:26:17.453
My Hippocratic oath
forbids me to tell Percy about it.

01:26:18.277 --> 01:26:19.571
Hmm.

01:26:22.532 --> 01:26:24.834
See? All better.

01:26:27.288 --> 01:26:28.539
Cured.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.251
Yes!

01:26:33.253 --> 01:26:35.507
I'm on the list.

01:26:36.047 --> 01:26:37.305
I'm on the list!

01:26:38.884 --> 01:26:40.854
Oh, shit.

01:26:47.602 --> 01:26:49.442
Sir.

01:26:57.154 --> 01:26:58.661
Yes, sir?

01:26:58.990 --> 01:27:00.662
Go in.

01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:04.871
Well?

01:27:05.205 --> 01:27:07.970
- Sir, it's about my posting.
- Posting?

01:27:08.417 --> 01:27:09.668
Korea, sir.

01:27:10.252 --> 01:27:11.504
Well?

01:27:12.171 --> 01:27:16.680
Well, sir, you said
it might be different if...

01:27:17.427 --> 01:27:18.981
If what?

01:27:19.096 --> 01:27:20.353
If the clock...

01:27:20.973 --> 01:27:22.230
Out with it.

01:27:22.766 --> 01:27:24.819
If I could tell you something
about the clock.

01:27:25.186 --> 01:27:26.437
Well?

01:27:28.439 --> 01:27:31.952
It was Sergeant Hapgood, sir.
He took it.

01:27:36.115 --> 01:27:39.544
Show us exactly what you did, Redmond.

01:27:47.044 --> 01:27:49.049
The fucking window's closed, you twat.

01:27:49.713 --> 01:27:52.846
Yes, sir. I opened the window
before I picked up the clock,

01:27:52.967 --> 01:27:56.349
I threw it out, the clock, sir,
then I closed the window after.

01:27:56.471 --> 01:27:58.523
Do it again. Do it right.

01:28:15.325 --> 01:28:19.383
I waited till Osbourne was
in the kitchen, then I did it quick.

01:28:20.415 --> 01:28:23.547
- Osbourne?
- Must have been very quick, sir.

01:28:23.835 --> 01:28:26.553
I was only in the kitchen
to drop off the crockery, like.

01:28:26.797 --> 01:28:30.854
All right, we'll time it.
Osbourne, off to the kitchen.

01:28:31.093 --> 01:28:33.015
Redmond, do the business.

01:28:37.767 --> 01:28:39.191
Go!

01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:55.381
Caught red-handed.

01:28:55.913 --> 01:28:58.815
What did you do when you saw
Redmond holding the clock, Osbourne?

01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:01.882
I didn't, sir.
I swear on my mothers life.

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:04.091
I don't give a fuck
about your mother's life.

01:29:04.214 --> 01:29:07.311
She deserves to die for
giving birth to you.

01:29:08.468 --> 01:29:10.022
If you were in on it, Osbourne,

01:29:10.471 --> 01:29:14.980
I swear, I'll cut your nuts off
and make you swallow them.

01:29:16.102 --> 01:29:20.113
Sir, I... I saw nothing, sir.

01:29:22.734 --> 01:29:25.784
So, Sergeant Hapgood,

01:29:25.905 --> 01:29:29.084
Redmond says you told him
to throw the clock out the window.

01:29:29.492 --> 01:29:30.785
Why would I do that, sir?

01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:33.331
I'm asking the fucking questions!

01:29:33.663 --> 01:29:36.214
- I did not.
- "I did not, sir!"

01:29:36.542 --> 01:29:37.930
I did not, sir!

01:29:38.335 --> 01:29:41.598
Redmond, why would you agree to this plan?

01:29:41.839 --> 01:29:43.227
What did you hope to gain?

01:29:43.633 --> 01:29:47.264
- Percy promised to pay me, sir.
- "Percy"? Your chum, is he?

01:29:47.804 --> 01:29:50.688
Sergeant Hapgood, sir.
- And did he pay you?

01:29:50.808 --> 01:29:53.738
Yes, sir. I went
straight to his quarters after.

01:29:53.853 --> 01:29:57.400
He paid me.
Sergeant Rohan was there. He saw it.

01:29:57.899 --> 01:29:59.987
Did Sergeant Hapgood have the clock?

01:30:00.110 --> 01:30:04.251
- He got it. He had it.
- Did you see it in his quarters?

01:30:04.657 --> 01:30:07.207
- He must have hid it, sir.
Sergeant Rohan.

01:30:08.369 --> 01:30:10.920
Describe what transpired, if you will.

01:30:11.956 --> 01:30:14.804
Private Redmond asked
Sergeant Hapgood if he had got it.

01:30:15.001 --> 01:30:17.007
The clock? He meant the clock?

01:30:17.421 --> 01:30:21.218
Sergeant Hapgood said, "Got what?"
Redmond said, "You know what."

01:30:21.342 --> 01:30:23.145
Sergeant Hapgood said, 'No, I don't.'

01:30:23.386 --> 01:30:25.059
Did he give Redmond money?

01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:29.395
He put something in his hand, sir.

01:30:29.518 --> 01:30:32.484
I owed him money for doing my brasses.

01:30:33.147 --> 01:30:35.995
I never done anyone's brasses, sir.

01:30:36.275 --> 01:30:38.245
I get nignogs to do my brasses.

01:30:38.361 --> 01:30:40.497
It was for throwing the clock
out the window.

01:30:44.576 --> 01:30:48.338
What a bunch of lying fucking wankers.

01:30:49.081 --> 01:30:52.546
This clock is going to haunt you.
I swear, you will never be free of it.

01:30:52.669 --> 01:30:55.173
You will rue the day.

01:30:55.422 --> 01:30:56.845
Dismiss!

01:31:00.469 --> 01:31:03.055
Sergeant Rohan, private word.

01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:08.946
Let us imagine for a moment

01:31:09.062 --> 01:31:11.946
that Sergeant Hapgood
was outside that window

01:31:12.691 --> 01:31:15.456
and adroitly caught the flying clock.

01:31:18.406 --> 01:31:21.372
Had he done so, he would have
taken it back to his quarters,

01:31:21.493 --> 01:31:23.249
which, of course, he shares with you.

01:31:23.370 --> 01:31:25.094
And you could hardly not have seen it,

01:31:25.119 --> 01:31:27.299
thus implicating you in the robbery.

01:31:27.416 --> 01:31:28.970
I did not see the clock, sir.

01:31:29.418 --> 01:31:33.381
Don't be hasty, Sergeant.
Think carefully.

01:31:35.008 --> 01:31:39.398
Next day, when the camp
was turned upside-down,

01:31:39.513 --> 01:31:44.105
Hapgood succeeded in disposing
of the clock, if indeed he had it,

01:31:44.227 --> 01:31:46.267
and you must have been aware
of how he did it.

01:31:49.191 --> 01:31:50.781
Habeas corpus.

01:31:51.234 --> 01:31:53.619
No clock, no case.

01:31:54.196 --> 01:31:55.620
So, basically, he's saying

01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:58.160
if you testify against me,
he'll let you off.

01:31:58.284 --> 01:32:00.087
And if I don't, I'm as guilty as you.

01:32:01.246 --> 01:32:06.003
The problem is, you look guilty.
I don't.

01:32:07.544 --> 01:32:09.479
- Anything you left out?
- No, nothing.

01:32:09.505 --> 01:32:12.186
What about when you went
to the hospital to see Ophelia?

01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:14.981
Sophie was there, wasn't she? My Sophie.

01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:17.272
You left that out. I wonder why'?

01:32:17.514 --> 01:32:19.851
- Didn't I mention that?
- No, you fucking didn't.

01:32:20.138 --> 01:32:22.269
- Where's Redmond?
- He's locked up in his cell.

01:32:22.294 --> 01:32:25.509
For his own safety. Afraid
that I'm going to fucking kill him.

01:32:26.566 --> 01:32:28.785
Look, just give it back, the clock.

01:32:29.027 --> 01:32:31.495
Let's make a deal.
We give it back, they drop charges.

01:32:31.859 --> 01:32:34.263
- You've made that deal, haven't you?
- Of course not.

01:32:34.288 --> 01:32:36.258
To save your own skin, you lying shit!

01:32:37.286 --> 01:32:39.256
And you fucked Sophie.

01:32:41.124 --> 01:32:43.260
You betrayed me, your friend,

01:32:43.376 --> 01:32:45.512
and you haven't even got the guts to fight.

01:32:58.143 --> 01:33:01.073
I did not make a deal with
Major Cross. I denied everything!

01:33:01.563 --> 01:33:04.411
But you did fuck Sophie?

01:33:06.068 --> 01:33:07.362
It was a moment of madness.

01:33:08.988 --> 01:33:10.376
Ophelia had just dumped me.

01:33:10.949 --> 01:33:13.001
Ophelia was out of your class.

01:33:13.911 --> 01:33:16.592
Sophie wanted you, not me.

01:33:17.081 --> 01:33:18.967
They know what they want, women.

01:33:19.250 --> 01:33:22.050
I'm sorry, Percy.

01:33:22.170 --> 01:33:26.560
Well, I fucked your sister, so we're even.

01:33:43.152 --> 01:33:47.079
- How did you...
- Work it out? Same way as you did.

01:33:47.615 --> 01:33:49.455
Only way to get it out of the camp.

01:33:49.576 --> 01:33:51.047
I was complicit, sir. I...

01:33:51.161 --> 01:33:53.249
No, he didn't. He knew nothing about it.

01:33:53.372 --> 01:33:57.797
Sergeant Hapgood, your court martial
has been arranged for next week.

01:33:58.377 --> 01:34:01.474
Lieutenant Fortesque-Brown,
to my right, will defend you.

01:34:02.382 --> 01:34:04.517
In the meantime, you are
under house arrest,

01:34:05.218 --> 01:34:07.555
under the supervision of Sergeant Rohan.

01:34:07.679 --> 01:34:08.937
Dismiss.

01:34:21.945 --> 01:34:24.117
Shepton Mallet Military Prison.

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:26.960
The name is enough to strike fear
in the bravest of soldiers,

01:34:26.985 --> 01:34:28.878
let alone a fucking conscript.

01:34:28.995 --> 01:34:31.250
I was Sergeant Major there for a year.

01:34:31.373 --> 01:34:35.679
Hell on Earth, Hapgood. Hell on Earth.

01:34:37.463 --> 01:34:40.049
How dare you take my clock!

01:34:43.595 --> 01:34:46.478
- Have you done this before?
- Actually not.

01:34:46.723 --> 01:34:48.729
- Any legal training?
- No.

01:34:49.101 --> 01:34:51.735
But then, we're not expecting
to win, are we?

01:34:52.104 --> 01:34:55.118
The best we can do is, um...
Oh, sit up, for God's sake.

01:34:55.233 --> 01:34:57.500
The best we can do
is get some character references

01:34:57.525 --> 01:35:00.954
to say what a good chap you are
and hope to reduce your sentence.

01:35:01.114 --> 01:35:03.285
- Right.
- Some names?

01:35:03.492 --> 01:35:05.912
Private Redmond and Sergeant Major Bradley.

01:35:06.245 --> 01:35:07.716
How do I Contact them?

01:35:08.039 --> 01:35:09.759
Redmond's on his way to Korea

01:35:09.874 --> 01:35:11.915
and Bradley’s in
a military hospital somewhere.

01:35:12.002 --> 01:35:14.137
I'm not a fool, Sergeant.

01:35:17.091 --> 01:35:19.594
It says here that your father
was killed in the war.

01:35:19.969 --> 01:35:23.600
- It could help our case.
- I don't want him used for this.

01:35:24.098 --> 01:35:27.563
I see here he was a rear gunner
in Lancaster bombers.

01:35:27.686 --> 01:35:29.109
Very high mortality rate.

01:35:30.314 --> 01:35:33.945
He, um, came out of a pub pissed
and fell under a truck.

01:35:34.068 --> 01:35:37.165
They gave him the Distinguished
Flying Cross for that?

01:35:38.698 --> 01:35:40.793
You are determined not to help your cause.

01:35:41.576 --> 01:35:43.463
But I insist you see a psychiatrist.

01:35:44.163 --> 01:35:46.002
Yours is not normal behaviour.

01:35:53.757 --> 01:35:55.727
Get up off your knees.

01:36:01.432 --> 01:36:04.289
If you want to do a runner, Percy,
I'll get you out of the camp.

01:36:04.769 --> 01:36:06.062
Right now, tonight.

01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:10.029
- What, and drop you in it?
- I can handle that.

01:36:10.609 --> 01:36:12.911
- You'd do that for me?
- Yes.

01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:14.874
- Why'?
- Why'?

01:36:15.406 --> 01:36:16.747
Why... Why do you think?

01:36:17.492 --> 01:36:19.378
Guilt, I expect.

01:36:20.912 --> 01:36:22.164
Fuck you.

01:36:27.753 --> 01:36:29.344
Good luck, Percy.

01:36:29.964 --> 01:36:31.215
Attention!

01:36:32.217 --> 01:36:35.349
All right, let's get this over with.

01:36:36.513 --> 01:36:38.768
This court martial is now in session.

01:36:39.992 --> 01:36:41.243
Prisoner and escort.

01:36:41.268 --> 01:36:44.650
Quick march. Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right.

01:36:44.772 --> 01:36:46.363
Left, right. Mark time.

01:36:48.443 --> 01:36:49.915
Halt.

01:36:50.737 --> 01:36:52.743
Prisoner and escort salute.

01:36:53.782 --> 01:36:55.914
You're accused of stealing
the regimental clock.

01:36:55.939 --> 01:36:57.190
How do you plead?

01:36:58.037 --> 01:36:59.924
Guilty as charged, sir.

01:37:01.041 --> 01:37:03.093
Major Cross, prosecuting, proceed.

01:37:08.466 --> 01:37:10.934
Sergeant Hapgood,
were you aware that this clock

01:37:11.052 --> 01:37:14.350
was of great sentimental importance
to the regiment?

01:37:15.265 --> 01:37:16.516
Yes, sir.

01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:20.279
- Was this clock of value to you?
- No, sir.

01:37:20.604 --> 01:37:23.108
So stealing the clock
was an act of deliberate malice

01:37:23.232 --> 01:37:24.739
towards the regiment?

01:37:25.026 --> 01:37:27.031
It was a protest against the RSM.

01:37:27.487 --> 01:37:28.875
Why the RSM?

01:37:31.116 --> 01:37:35.376
Because...
Because he is a sadistic bully.

01:37:35.788 --> 01:37:37.959
You're not helping your cause, Sergeant.

01:37:40.835 --> 01:37:42.841
Lieutenant Fortesque-Brown, proceed.

01:37:43.672 --> 01:37:46.555
Sir, I ask the court

01:37:46.675 --> 01:37:51.896
to hear the testimony
of Major Smythe, a psychiatrist.

01:37:52.223 --> 01:37:54.525
I won't have a trick cyclist in my court.

01:37:54.890 --> 01:37:56.749
The minds of soldiers belong to the Army,

01:37:56.774 --> 01:37:59.492
not to some dubious branch
of the medical profession.

01:37:59.815 --> 01:38:01.951
He is in attendance, sir.

01:38:02.067 --> 01:38:03.491
Request denied.

01:38:04.111 --> 01:38:08.454
Sir, if I may summarise
Major Smythe's opinion.

01:38:08.658 --> 01:38:12.799
He says that Sergeant Hapgood
is claustrophobic

01:38:12.913 --> 01:38:14.586
and living in a closed camp

01:38:14.707 --> 01:38:18.385
has exerted unendurable pressure
on his mind.

01:38:19.379 --> 01:38:21.218
Smuggling the clock out of the camp

01:38:21.339 --> 01:38:24.934
was his way of relieving that pressure.

01:38:25.344 --> 01:38:27.729
I won't have it, I tell you.

01:38:28.055 --> 01:38:30.322
- Strike it from the record.
- Yes, sir.

01:38:30.348 --> 01:38:32.055
Sir, respectfully, I would remind you

01:38:32.176 --> 01:38:34.906
that Sergeant Major Bradley and others

01:38:35.021 --> 01:38:37.425
have recently succumbed
to the pressures of this camp.

01:38:37.482 --> 01:38:39.614
There have been two suicides
in the last quarter

01:38:39.651 --> 01:38:41.657
and several unsuccessful attempts.

01:38:42.154 --> 01:38:43.661
Are you a conscript, Lieutenant?

01:38:43.781 --> 01:38:45.204
- Yes, sir.
- Enough said.

01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:49.497
I have to process 400 conscripts
through this camp every six weeks.

01:38:49.704 --> 01:38:52.919
We're all under pressure.
Put up with it. Get over it.

01:38:53.792 --> 01:38:55.880
All done? Right.

01:38:56.003 --> 01:38:58.305
- Sir, may I call Sergeant Rohan?
- What for?

01:38:58.631 --> 01:39:00.304
Character witness, sir.

01:39:01.426 --> 01:39:03.930
Very well.
Have your say and make it quick.

01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:09.273
- A loyal friend, sir and...
- And what?

01:39:10.561 --> 01:39:14.570
We did the commando training together
and he came out on top of the course.

01:39:14.756 --> 01:39:17.404
- He could kill you with his bare hands if...
- If what?

01:39:17.715 --> 01:39:19.058
If necessary.

01:39:20.697 --> 01:39:23.415
Not you, sir. I meant the enemy.

01:39:25.036 --> 01:39:27.171
Well, I don't have to be
concerned about that,

01:39:27.747 --> 01:39:29.799
because Hapgood will be in Shepton Mallet

01:39:29.916 --> 01:39:32.467
serving three months for
stealing the clock,

01:39:32.586 --> 01:39:34.556
two weeks for impugning the RSM

01:39:34.838 --> 01:39:38.018
and a further month
for showing no contrition.

01:39:38.759 --> 01:39:40.011
Sir.

01:39:42.222 --> 01:39:43.990
Yes, of course. It goes without saying.

01:39:44.015 --> 01:39:46.815
Sergeant Hapgood reduced to the tanks.

01:39:47.019 --> 01:39:49.439
Very well.
This court is no longer in session.

01:39:49.647 --> 01:39:51.486
God bless Her Majesty.

01:39:52.024 --> 01:39:54.160
Prisoner and escort salute.

01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:56.571
About turn.

01:39:57.781 --> 01:40:02.088
Quick march. Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.

01:40:02.202 --> 01:40:04.042
Left, right. Left, right...

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:18.564
Cheers!

01:40:24.728 --> 01:40:27.658
- Sorry about your chum.
- Thank you, sir.

01:40:42.873 --> 01:40:46.836
Your mate Hapgood brought great shame
on this regiment today.

01:40:47.336 --> 01:40:51.299
Men like me, Sergeant Rohan,
we fought for king and country,

01:40:51.424 --> 01:40:52.931
we fought for what was right.

01:40:53.051 --> 01:40:55.851
But you perks, you're weak,

01:40:55.971 --> 01:40:58.819
'cause you've got no belief,
no faith in the flag,

01:40:58.933 --> 01:41:02.445
no grit, no guts,
no god, no self-respect.

01:41:02.812 --> 01:41:05.577
Our country is fucked. Fucked.

01:41:05.690 --> 01:41:08.075
Your country, sir, but our country is not.

01:41:09.403 --> 01:41:12.396
I said, "I'm the Skiver.
You're the one with the donkey."

01:41:13.908 --> 01:41:15.830
You should be in fucking Korea.

01:41:15.952 --> 01:41:18.538
- Skived out of it, didn't I?
- Yeah, by fingering Percy.

01:41:19.039 --> 01:41:20.510
Well, he dropped me in the shit

01:41:20.624 --> 01:41:22.664
and he'd fuck you over, too,
if it suited him.

01:41:26.547 --> 01:41:27.798
Was he coming on to you?

01:41:27.882 --> 01:41:29.878
A uniform like that
could turn a girl's head.

01:41:33.388 --> 01:41:35.310
He's a posh prick.

01:41:35.432 --> 01:41:39.145
You're jealous, Bill. I'm so pleased.

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:41.784
Percy wanted me to let you know
why he couldn't come tonight.

01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:43.613
Oh, the major told me all about it.

01:41:43.691 --> 01:41:45.779
"Clever young chap
but foolhardy.

01:41:45.902 --> 01:41:47.907
"Not worthy of you, my dear."

01:41:48.029 --> 01:41:51.494
Going to a military prison
for four months is not funny.

01:41:51.784 --> 01:41:55.497
It's terrible.
But it does make him a bit of a hero.

01:41:55.621 --> 01:41:57.792
He'll like that.

01:41:58.416 --> 01:42:00.386
Oh, don't be so pompous.

01:42:01.628 --> 01:42:03.716
Might as well dance, since you're here.

01:42:11.306 --> 01:42:15.731
About what happened,
what we did at the hospital.

01:42:16.186 --> 01:42:18.737
- What was that?
- You know what.

01:42:19.732 --> 01:42:21.951
Oh, that.

01:42:22.276 --> 01:42:24.198
What about it?

01:42:25.029 --> 01:42:27.913
I'm very sorry. It won't happen again.

01:42:28.658 --> 01:42:30.960
Oh! How disappointing.

01:42:55.564 --> 01:42:57.070
Unlock me for a minute, will you?

01:42:57.190 --> 01:43:00.662
- I've got to get something out of my kit bag.
- Not a chance.

01:43:00.903 --> 01:43:03.751
I'm hurt that you think
I'd run off on you, Bill.

01:43:03.948 --> 01:43:05.870
You can get it now.

01:43:07.535 --> 01:43:10.964
The Army allows you
to write one letter a week,

01:43:11.081 --> 01:43:13.003
but you have to write it on an Army form

01:43:13.125 --> 01:43:17.005
which has Shepton Mallet
Military Prison printed at the top.

01:43:17.713 --> 01:43:21.526
I don't want my mum to know I'm in prison,
so I'll send the letters to you, Bill.

01:43:21.772 --> 01:43:23.721
I want you to cut off the tops

01:43:23.845 --> 01:43:26.432
and post them on in these stamped envelopes

01:43:27.891 --> 01:43:29.315
to my mum

01:43:29.643 --> 01:43:30.937
and she'll never know.

01:43:31.062 --> 01:43:33.696
18 weeks' worth.
Why don't you just tell her?

01:43:34.774 --> 01:43:37.705
'Cause it'd break her heart,
Dad being a war hero and all.

01:43:42.741 --> 01:43:44.663
We've arrived at the station.

01:43:45.912 --> 01:43:47.499
Someone we know is meeting us here.

01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:48.832
Who?

01:43:54.672 --> 01:43:57.851
- Hey! Come on.
- Hey!

01:43:57.967 --> 01:44:02.101
- Look, there's your Uncle Billy.
- Robert. Linda. Look at you guys.

01:44:02.138 --> 01:44:03.197
Hi.

01:44:03.223 --> 01:44:04.519
- I'm your Uncle Bill.
- Hey.

01:44:04.545 --> 01:44:08.111
Wow. Handcuffs.
Did they bust you, Uncle Bill?

01:44:08.687 --> 01:44:10.709
They got you in the end, hey, Perce?

01:44:10.824 --> 01:44:13.700
Well, Bradley, Redmond, me.
Bill's the last man standing.

01:44:13.818 --> 01:44:16.998
- Still on the fence, Billy.
- Hmm.

01:44:17.113 --> 01:44:20.376
Bill came through for me.
He's a better friend than I deserve.

01:44:20.951 --> 01:44:24.748
- And he has a sexy sister.
- Yeah, 27, two kids.

01:44:25.206 --> 01:44:26.927
Two beautiful kids.

01:44:28.501 --> 01:44:31.005
I'm not going back to Canada.

01:44:31.129 --> 01:44:33.384
May I come and see you after?

01:44:34.133 --> 01:44:36.102
Please do.

01:44:38.487 --> 01:44:39.739
All aboard!
- Oh!

01:44:39.764 --> 01:44:42.065
Okay, we've got to go.
Come on, kids. Come on.

01:44:43.101 --> 01:44:45.244
- Bye, Bill.
- Bye. We'll see you at Christmas.

01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:48.367
Bye. See you soon!

01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:50.741
Bye, boys!

01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:53.577
- Bye, Uncle Bill!
- Bye, Percy!

01:44:54.447 --> 01:44:55.918
Whoo!

01:44:56.992 --> 01:45:00.835
- So, Dawn really got to you?
- Yeah. I'm a goner.

01:45:11.508 --> 01:45:13.762
Sergeant Rohan delivering Private Hapgood.

01:45:13.885 --> 01:45:15.211
Open the gates!

01:45:15.237 --> 01:45:17.480
Well, Percy, see you in four months.

01:45:19.517 --> 01:45:21.237
Long before that.

01:45:21.769 --> 01:45:24.487
There must be some way
of breaking out of this place.

01:45:31.322 --> 01:45:32.994
Come on! Come on!

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:45.131
And don't let Sophie
slip through your fingers.

01:45:45.254 --> 01:45:48.774
Where are you gonna find tits like that
and a sense of humour all in one girl?

01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.051
Thanks, Percy.

01:45:50.385 --> 01:45:52.390
Come on, move it, you. Keep moving.

01:46:15.621 --> 01:46:17.591
Sergeant Major Bradley?

01:46:20.418 --> 01:46:23.183
- Wingate Ward, second floor.
- Thank you.

01:46:40.399 --> 01:46:43.413
Hello, Sarge. It's me, Henderson.

01:46:43.528 --> 01:46:46.245
- What are you in for?
- Frostbite.

01:46:46.573 --> 01:46:48.543
You were right about the Korean weather.

01:46:48.659 --> 01:46:50.960
Well, frostbite's not too bad.

01:46:51.078 --> 01:46:55.670
Yeah, but then I stepped on a mine,
came back without my foot.

01:46:56.292 --> 01:46:58.244
You were always larking about, Henderson.

01:46:58.270 --> 01:47:01.430
Yeah, well, training was a bit of a lark.

01:47:01.631 --> 01:47:03.518
But when they start shooting at you,

01:47:03.634 --> 01:47:06.731
well, it wipes the smile off your face.

01:47:07.972 --> 01:47:10.108
Yes.

01:47:11.017 --> 01:47:13.900
We will continue with the therapy every day

01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:16.026
and we'll see how you get on.

01:47:17.191 --> 01:47:20.121
Sir. Sergeant Major Bradley?

01:47:20.236 --> 01:47:22.206
He's in the end.

01:47:31.165 --> 01:47:33.502
Bill Rohan, Sergeant Major.

01:47:36.212 --> 01:47:39.226
I brought you The Telegraph.

01:47:40.383 --> 01:47:42.139
For the crossword.

01:47:54.190 --> 01:47:55.614
I just wanted to say...

01:47:55.734 --> 01:48:01.044
There is nothing you can say

01:48:01.949 --> 01:48:06.291
that is of any interest to me.

01:48:08.039 --> 01:48:11.801
Your demeanour is slovenly.

01:48:13.545 --> 01:48:16.809
Most slovenly.

01:48:19.761 --> 01:48:21.433
Dismiss.

01:48:24.308 --> 01:48:26.277
Dismiss, I say.

01:48:33.443 --> 01:48:36.124
Post-traumatic stress syndrome.

01:48:36.238 --> 01:48:38.539
They called it shell shock
in the First World War.

01:48:38.949 --> 01:48:41.168
Half these lads suffer from it.

01:48:41.452 --> 01:48:43.789
Bradley got a bad dose
in the Normandy invasions.

01:48:43.996 --> 01:48:46.215
So living by the letter
of the Army law was...

01:48:46.332 --> 01:48:48.717
Was his way of holding himself together.

01:48:51.713 --> 01:48:54.217
- Thanks, Sarge.
- Take care of yourself, Henderson.

01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:57.433
You know me, Sarge.
Always putting my foot in it.

01:49:11.736 --> 01:49:15.284
I served up my time
and went home to the river,

01:49:15.615 --> 01:49:20.257
the river my mother had left to after our
house was destroyed during the London Blitz.

01:49:24.834 --> 01:49:26.804
Everything was different now.

01:49:30.507 --> 01:49:32.144
Help! I'm drowning!

01:49:35.638 --> 01:49:37.857
- Keep going, Sophie.
- Bill!

01:49:37.974 --> 01:49:39.535
- Bill, help!
- It's really good.

01:49:39.561 --> 01:49:41.777
Bill, help! I'm not acting!

01:49:41.936 --> 01:49:43.324
Keep going.

01:49:44.439 --> 01:49:45.863
Help me, please!

01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:48.571
- Bill, I'm cramping!
- What?

01:49:58.997 --> 01:50:00.967
Only kidding.

01:50:01.083 --> 01:50:03.847
- Do you think that's funny?
- Yeah.
