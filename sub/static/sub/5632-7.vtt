WEBVTT

00:04.359 --> 00:07.361
That's too steep for me.

00:07.395 --> 00:08.829
Why don't you go for it?

00:08.863 --> 00:10.196
No. No, no. No.

00:10.231 --> 00:12.698
Uh, you go.

00:12.733 --> 00:13.733
Come on, girls.

00:13.767 --> 00:16.201
Why do you think we came here?

00:20.640 --> 00:22.207
I didn't sign up for this!

Bennie!

00:37.155 --> 00:39.991
Bennie, you okay?

00:44.029 --> 00:45.764
Yeah!

00:45.798 --> 00:47.598
Yeah!
Oh, yeah!

00:49.100 --> 00:51.968
Yeah!

00:52.003 --> 00:53.303
Oh, dude!

00:53.337 --> 00:54.872
Your bone's sticking out!

00:56.340 --> 00:57.374
Oh, my God!

00:57.409 --> 01:00.744
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

01:02.614 --> 01:04.146
Wait.

01:04.180 --> 01:06.582
This isn't my bone.

01:21.831 --> 01:24.666
You all right, Bennie?

01:26.368 --> 01:28.837
<i>Okay, good news.</i>

01:28.871 --> 01:30.539
Christine's first tooth
just fell out.

01:30.573 --> 01:32.006
Look at that.
How exciting!

01:32.041 --> 01:33.374
Which tooth?
I don't know-- her front one.

01:33.409 --> 01:36.177
Uh, for future
reference, this is

01:36.211 --> 01:38.512
the deciduous lower
central incisor.

01:38.547 --> 01:40.213
Great, I'll remember that.
Oh, and I told Christine

01:40.248 --> 01:41.982
the Tooth Fairy's
gonna be paying a visit.

01:42.016 --> 01:43.684
Actually, I'd prefer it
if we didn't do that.

01:43.718 --> 01:45.185
Why?

01:45.219 --> 01:47.521
It's a modern pastiche
of minor myths

01:47.556 --> 01:50.558
which completely
lack thought or substance.

01:50.592 --> 01:52.993
It's tradition.
There's no harm in that.

01:53.027 --> 01:55.061
On the contrary, I don't
want to teach our daughter

01:55.095 --> 01:57.630
that it is okay for a stranger
to break into her room

01:57.665 --> 02:00.333
and steal discarded body parts.
Body parts? We're not talking

02:00.367 --> 02:01.434
about body parts; we're talking
about a tooth here.

02:01.469 --> 02:02.669
That's a body part, Booth.

02:02.703 --> 02:03.870
Well, it's n--

02:03.904 --> 02:06.205
Oh. Oh, a body was found

02:06.239 --> 02:09.208
in the woods near the national
park in Gainesville, Virginia.

02:09.241 --> 02:11.009
Oh, Aubrey's on the way.

02:11.044 --> 02:12.878
You know, it would actually
be more valuable

02:12.912 --> 02:14.813
if we explain to Christine

02:14.848 --> 02:17.449
the science behind
deciduous teeth.

02:17.484 --> 02:20.285
How the upper incisors
are the first to shed.

02:20.319 --> 02:23.221
Oh, that sounds like a blast.

02:28.994 --> 02:32.597
Whoa! That's one hell
of a way to park a bike.

02:32.631 --> 02:34.098
Must've been
a gnarly landing.

02:34.132 --> 02:35.566
Yeah, gnarly and painful.

02:35.601 --> 02:37.101
The mountain biker
said that this bone

02:37.135 --> 02:39.336
lodged itself into his arm.

02:39.371 --> 02:41.372
The sub-pubic angle
of the pelvis

02:41.406 --> 02:43.073
tells me that
the victim was a female.

02:43.108 --> 02:46.442
Bone density suggests that
she was around her mid-20s.

02:46.477 --> 02:49.112
Well, and surface flesh
is pretty much gone,

02:49.146 --> 02:50.446
but not from decomposition.

02:50.481 --> 02:52.415
Well, you can chalk that up
to tons of predation.

02:52.449 --> 02:53.717
I mean,
these trails are teeming

02:53.751 --> 02:56.419
with coyotes,
uh, badgers, foxes.

02:56.453 --> 02:58.922
Do we have time of death yet?

02:58.956 --> 03:00.223
Well, the first
molting of maggots

03:00.257 --> 03:01.525
have turned into
second-instar larvae.

03:01.559 --> 03:03.225
So I'd say time of death

03:03.259 --> 03:04.860
is in the last 48 hours.

03:04.895 --> 03:06.729
The ribs appear to have
received multiple fractures,

03:06.763 --> 03:08.864
uh, from the impact
of the bicycle.

03:08.899 --> 03:10.032
Well, yeah,

03:10.066 --> 03:12.434
I mean, 170-pound biker,

03:12.468 --> 03:14.603
a 25-pound bike,
factor in the rate

03:14.638 --> 03:16.739
of acceleration
and come on, I mean,

03:16.773 --> 03:18.340
it's your basic high school
physics problem.

03:18.374 --> 03:19.508
Not in my high school.

03:19.542 --> 03:20.909
Well, we can rule out

03:20.943 --> 03:22.410
a jogger or hiker.

03:22.444 --> 03:24.111
Yeah, the heels
would suggest otherwise.

03:24.146 --> 03:26.714
Dried blood.

03:34.557 --> 03:36.890
Well, there's
more blood over here.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.559
If she fell about there,

03:38.593 --> 03:41.327
she would've rolled
and hit the outcropping.

03:41.362 --> 03:43.329
Okay.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.601
Drag marks.

03:47.635 --> 03:49.002
So her body

03:49.037 --> 03:50.938
was thrown down there.

03:50.972 --> 03:53.573
Someone was trying
to get rid of her.

03:53.607 --> 03:56.709
Yeah, well, I guess they
didn't try hard enough.

04:40.068 --> 04:41.667
She was wearing
something stretchy.

04:41.703 --> 04:42.902
Work-out clothes?

04:42.937 --> 04:44.503
The victim's bone density,

04:44.539 --> 04:46.706
splayed metatarsals,
and light frame

04:46.741 --> 04:48.007
would support her
being a dancer.

04:48.042 --> 04:49.075
So does her muscle tone.

04:49.110 --> 04:50.543
What's left of it.

04:50.578 --> 04:52.812
Christine has shed
her first tooth.

04:52.847 --> 04:55.014
Congratulations.

04:55.049 --> 04:56.749
Booth wants to leave
a dollar under her pillow

04:56.784 --> 04:59.318
and pretend it came
from a fairy.

04:59.354 --> 05:01.387
Yeah, of course,
the Tooth Fairy.

05:01.422 --> 05:03.122
The Tooth Fairy's been
visiting Michael Vincent

05:03.157 --> 05:04.657
almost every week lately.

05:04.692 --> 05:05.658
Well, aren't you concerned

05:05.693 --> 05:06.692
it insults his intelligence?

05:06.728 --> 05:08.728
Michael Vincent is six.

05:08.763 --> 05:10.196
Which means he is
old enough to understand

05:10.231 --> 05:11.764
you are essentially
perpetrating a fraud.

05:11.799 --> 05:14.934
Well, no complaints
from Michael Vincent so far.

05:14.969 --> 05:16.335
It appears the trauma
to the ribs and the upper body

05:16.371 --> 05:18.170
were not all caused
by the bike.

05:18.206 --> 05:20.773
The victim also suffered
extensive antemortem injuries

05:20.808 --> 05:22.475
that have since remodeled.

05:22.510 --> 05:24.277
Perhaps she was previously
in an accident.

05:24.312 --> 05:26.412
This damage was not caused

05:26.447 --> 05:28.414
by a discrete event.

05:28.449 --> 05:31.918
The remodeling of the ischia
and both clavicles indicate

05:31.953 --> 05:34.987
it was incurred over the
course of the last decade.

05:35.023 --> 05:37.556
You're right--
the acromioclavicular ligament

05:37.592 --> 05:40.026
shows signs
of repeated dislocation.

05:40.061 --> 05:41.594
I'm also seeing signs

05:41.629 --> 05:44.263
of expanded articulation
of the glenoid fossae.

05:44.299 --> 05:47.800
Her shoulders were repeatedly
displaced out of their socket.

05:49.103 --> 05:50.569
There's something unusual

05:50.605 --> 05:52.204
in the upper
esophageal sphincter.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.440
Let's see.

05:58.279 --> 05:59.946
It's some kind of key.

05:59.981 --> 06:01.213
To what?

06:01.249 --> 06:02.782
I don't know.

06:02.817 --> 06:04.817
I've never seen one
quite like this before.

06:04.852 --> 06:07.520
Do you think
she was force-fed this?

06:10.325 --> 06:11.891
No.

06:11.926 --> 06:13.659
There are no apparent
avulsion fractures

06:13.695 --> 06:16.529
on the mastoid processes
to support that hypothesis.

06:16.564 --> 06:19.365
But it feels like there could be
scarring on the trachea.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.500
So she'd done this
more than once?

06:21.536 --> 06:23.202
That appears to be the case.

06:23.237 --> 06:25.571
But why?

06:28.643 --> 06:30.409
All right, but
what about that one?

06:30.445 --> 06:32.378
That one's good,
but I like this one.

06:32.413 --> 06:34.847
But when you print it out, be
sure to dial up the contrast.

06:34.882 --> 06:36.415
Oh, yeah.

06:36.451 --> 06:38.317
Right, I should've
thought of that.

06:38.353 --> 06:40.353
Then there'd be no point
in my being here.

06:41.422 --> 06:43.255
Sorry, I, uh,

06:43.291 --> 06:44.957
didn't mean to interrupt.
Oh, no.

06:44.993 --> 06:47.259
Hey, you remember
Sebastian, right?

06:47.295 --> 06:49.261
He's been giving me advice
on my photography.

06:49.297 --> 06:51.097
I'm back in town

06:51.132 --> 06:53.099
and wanted to see how
Angela's work has progressed.

06:53.134 --> 06:54.667
But evidently,

06:54.702 --> 06:56.569
you need Angela
for other things.

06:56.604 --> 06:58.204
Thank you, I do.

06:58.239 --> 07:00.039
Then I won't get
in your way.

07:00.074 --> 07:01.574
Please let me know
when you have time.

07:01.609 --> 07:04.276
Yeah, of course.

07:04.312 --> 07:06.645
Hey, so,

07:06.681 --> 07:08.381
I've got a reconstruction

07:08.416 --> 07:09.749
of the victim's face.

07:09.784 --> 07:11.183
All that predation
made it difficult,

07:11.219 --> 07:14.387
but I was able
to narrow it down to a pool

07:14.422 --> 07:17.089
of 379 women in the D.C. area.

07:17.125 --> 07:18.858
Okay, well,

07:18.893 --> 07:21.060
here's the right second
distal phalanx I retrieved.

07:21.095 --> 07:22.728
Hopefully there's
enough for a print.

07:22.764 --> 07:25.398
Yeah, let's run that through
the fingerprint scanner.

07:37.512 --> 07:39.678
Wow, that's a total mess.

07:39.714 --> 07:42.748
Well, it might be enough to
extrapolate a partial pattern.

07:42.784 --> 07:46.085
So, your world-famous
photographer?

07:46.120 --> 07:47.386
He's a handsome guy.

07:47.422 --> 07:49.388
And by that you mean?

07:49.424 --> 07:51.924
That Sebastian
may be interested

07:51.959 --> 07:53.592
in more than just
your photography.

07:53.628 --> 07:55.161
Oh, stop it.

07:55.196 --> 07:56.762
He's a mentor.

07:56.798 --> 07:58.230
That's it.

07:58.266 --> 08:00.633
Well, it's not complete,

08:00.668 --> 08:01.934
but it might
get us something.

08:01.969 --> 08:04.537
Let me run it through
the IAFIS database.

08:04.572 --> 08:08.607
I'll cross-reference these
against the matches

08:08.643 --> 08:10.509
from my facial reconstruction.

08:13.281 --> 08:15.581
We found our victim.

08:15.616 --> 08:17.450
Klarissa Mott.

08:17.485 --> 08:21.520
27 years old
from Silver Spring, Maryland.

08:26.461 --> 08:29.228
<i> We've got no</i>
<i>missing person's report</i>

08:29.263 --> 08:30.896
on Klarissa Mott
at D.C. Metro

08:30.932 --> 08:33.265
and no known relatives
in the D.C. area.

08:33.301 --> 08:35.134
Squints reported
signs of abuse.

08:35.169 --> 08:37.403
Did she ever file a restraining
order against her boyfriend?

08:37.438 --> 08:39.371
Nope, never made a domestic
violence call, either.

08:39.407 --> 08:41.039
That doesn't make any sense.

08:41.075 --> 08:43.708
I mean, a 20-something-year-old
woman from the 'burbs,

08:43.744 --> 08:47.646
she disappears for days,
and nobody, no one--

08:47.682 --> 08:50.182
not even her roommate--
reports her missing?

08:52.353 --> 08:55.387
Hi, we're Special
Agents Aubrey and--

08:55.423 --> 08:57.356
FBI, Special Agent Seeley Booth.

08:57.391 --> 08:58.624
I'm Victor Cornachio.

08:58.659 --> 09:00.392
What's going on?

09:00.428 --> 09:02.561
We're here to see Anna Lloyd.

09:02.597 --> 09:04.296
That's my girlfriend.
We were just cooking.

09:04.332 --> 09:05.798
Come in.

09:05.833 --> 09:08.200
Wow.

09:08.236 --> 09:10.336
Smells good in here.

09:10.371 --> 09:12.338
Anna and I just started
a catering business.

09:12.373 --> 09:15.207
Mandarin-peel truffle oil?

09:15.243 --> 09:16.842
That's amazing--
That's exciting you know your oils.

09:16.878 --> 09:18.344
Can we get
back to work now?

09:18.379 --> 09:20.012
Here's Anna.
You mind

09:20.047 --> 09:21.981
if I finish packing this up?
Oh, just stay close.

09:22.016 --> 09:23.249
We might have
some questions for you.

09:23.284 --> 09:26.752
Can we speak to you
over here, please?

09:28.389 --> 09:29.788
What's this about?

09:29.824 --> 09:31.891
This is about your
roommate Klarissa Mott.

09:31.926 --> 09:33.893
She was found murdered.

09:33.928 --> 09:36.862
Oh, my God,
that's horrible.

09:36.898 --> 09:39.098
Hmm, were you two close?

09:39.133 --> 09:41.333
I didn't know her very well.

09:41.369 --> 09:43.736
We found each other online,
we kept to ourselves.

09:43.771 --> 09:45.237
Can you think of anyone
who'd want to hurt her?

09:45.273 --> 09:46.705
Not that I knew of.

09:46.741 --> 09:49.041
She spent most of her time
in another world,

09:49.076 --> 09:51.110
to be honest with you.
What do you mean?

09:51.145 --> 09:53.045
She's was into some weird stuff.

09:59.453 --> 10:01.921
Straightjackets and handcuffs.

10:01.956 --> 10:03.455
She was a magician?

10:03.491 --> 10:05.291
I said that once to her
and she corrected me.

10:05.326 --> 10:07.226
She said she was
an escape artist.

10:07.261 --> 10:08.494
You know,
like a performer?

10:08.529 --> 10:10.529
Like Houdini.
Exactly.

10:10.565 --> 10:12.965
She did shows at this club
called the Magic Palace.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.733
She went
by another name?

10:14.769 --> 10:17.536
Yep, Klarissa Bilbao.

10:24.529 --> 10:25.562
<i>Will you stay</i>

10:25.597 --> 10:26.563
<i>in the left lane, Bones?</i>

10:26.598 --> 10:28.097
<i>It always moves faster.</i>

10:28.133 --> 10:29.766
Your evidence
is purely anecdotal.

10:29.801 --> 10:31.467
All lanes of traffic average
out to the same speed.

10:31.503 --> 10:33.136
You would be quite irritated
if I told you how to drive.

10:33.171 --> 10:34.771
That wouldn't happen.

10:34.806 --> 10:37.607
I think that we can agree
I'm the driver in this family.

10:37.642 --> 10:39.075
Usually, yes, but this car

10:39.110 --> 10:41.211
is too technologically
advanced for you.

10:41.246 --> 10:42.712
Bones, I know how to fly
a helicopter, all right?

10:42.747 --> 10:45.782
And besides, this car's
as user-friendly as it gets.

10:45.817 --> 10:47.483
I have to admit
it is easy to drive.

10:47.519 --> 10:49.619
And when the car's not moving,
Christine enjoys

10:49.654 --> 10:52.188
playing with
the reclining rear seats.

10:53.558 --> 10:56.326
Brennan.

10:56.361 --> 10:58.428
I found burn marks
on our victim.

10:58.463 --> 11:00.630
Did you find evidence
of smoke inhalation?

11:00.665 --> 11:02.465
No, the burns were
at least a week old,

11:02.500 --> 11:05.368
but Dr. Hodgins found
trace residue

11:05.403 --> 11:08.104
of mercury and nitrocellulose.

11:08.139 --> 11:09.439
Those are accelerants.

11:09.474 --> 11:10.940
You think someone tried
to burn her?

11:10.976 --> 11:13.142
The fact that I found marks
on both arms

11:13.178 --> 11:14.310
is consistent with assault.

11:14.346 --> 11:15.478
Well, thanks, Cam.

11:15.513 --> 11:16.713
We'll get on it.
Let's go, Bones.

11:16.748 --> 11:17.780
Stay in the left lane.

11:17.816 --> 11:20.750
<i>Just let me drive.</i>

11:25.223 --> 11:26.756
Oh, come on, Bones.

11:26.791 --> 11:28.091
Don't look so serious, huh?

11:28.126 --> 11:29.792
Booth...
This is the Magic Palace.

11:29.828 --> 11:31.494
I am a scientist.

11:31.529 --> 11:35.331
Science's primary aim
is to search for the truth.

11:35.367 --> 11:36.899
Magic sets out to deceive.

11:36.935 --> 11:38.701
Just like the Tooth Fairy.

11:38.737 --> 11:40.603
Let's not bring the
Tooth Fairy into this, okay?

11:40.639 --> 11:44.607
Well, Christine needs to
know that her baby teeth

11:44.643 --> 11:45.842
fall out for a reason,

11:45.877 --> 11:47.910
not so she can get
ice cream money

11:47.946 --> 11:49.812
from an imaginary goblin.

11:49.848 --> 11:51.914
Ice cream that
will, ironically,

11:51.950 --> 11:53.216
cause her to lose more teeth.

11:53.251 --> 11:54.884
It's not a goblin,
it's a fairy, okay?

11:54.919 --> 11:56.419
But just look at this place,
look around you.

11:56.454 --> 11:57.654
Look at all these
old magic tricks.

11:57.689 --> 11:59.022
Look, there's
Houdini's handcuffs.

11:59.057 --> 12:00.957
Look at these cards here.

12:00.992 --> 12:03.293
The Great Lafayette's
dog leash.

12:03.328 --> 12:04.894
Hi, can I help you?

12:04.929 --> 12:06.062
FBI Special Agent Booth.

12:06.097 --> 12:07.463
This here is my partner.
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

12:07.499 --> 12:10.233
Right, we're here
to see Mr. Jay.

12:10.268 --> 12:12.235
Oh, okay, uh...

12:12.270 --> 12:14.771
Dad, someone here to see you.

12:14.806 --> 12:16.372
Oh, hello.

12:16.408 --> 12:17.607
I-I-I'm Mr. Jay.

12:17.642 --> 12:19.275
Mr. Jay.
This about Klarissa?

12:19.311 --> 12:20.510
We called her apartment,

12:20.545 --> 12:22.078
and her roommate told us
the horrible news.

12:22.113 --> 12:23.846
Right, so how long
has she been working for you?

12:23.882 --> 12:25.181
Oh, I met her years ago

12:25.216 --> 12:27.850
when she was doing street magic
on the National Mall.

12:27.886 --> 12:29.326
So you gave Klarissa
her start, then.

12:29.354 --> 12:30.753
Yes, I could see

12:30.789 --> 12:32.055
her talent immediately,

12:32.090 --> 12:33.356
and it paid off,

12:33.391 --> 12:35.091
because her shows
were just groundbreaking.

12:35.126 --> 12:37.026
Groundbreaking in what sense?

12:37.062 --> 12:38.961
Klarissa took greater risks
than most escapologists.

12:38.997 --> 12:41.631
I mean, she was fearless.

12:41.666 --> 12:43.566
Well, that could be the result
of a neurological imbalance.

12:43.601 --> 12:45.201
Did she have any enemies

12:45.236 --> 12:47.136
at the club?
Well, the Palace

12:47.172 --> 12:48.838
is an incubator
for young talent,

12:48.873 --> 12:51.607
and everyone's always jostling
for stage time.

12:51.643 --> 12:53.142
Any of her rivals
jealous of her?

12:53.178 --> 12:54.310
She had just secured

12:54.346 --> 12:55.311
the Friday night main stage.

12:55.347 --> 12:57.080
Uh, that's our
most coveted slot.

12:57.115 --> 12:58.848
Whom did she replace?

13:02.454 --> 13:04.654
All right, follow me.

13:20.138 --> 13:22.305
That's, uh, Big Phil Leeds.

13:22.340 --> 13:25.708
He was Klarissa's fiercest rival
for years.

13:26.778 --> 13:28.311
Whoa, you seeing
what I'm seeing?

13:28.346 --> 13:31.614
Perhaps the cause
of Klarissa's burns.

13:34.586 --> 13:36.219
We found a
second-degree burn

13:36.254 --> 13:37.553
on your colleague,

13:37.589 --> 13:39.489
Klarissa Mott's
body, Big Phil.

13:40.992 --> 13:42.592
So? What does that have
to do with me?

13:42.627 --> 13:44.394
Well, when we swabbed
it for chemicals,

13:44.429 --> 13:45.661
you know what came back?

13:45.697 --> 13:47.296
Mercury and nitrocellulose.

13:47.332 --> 13:49.298
The stuff that you work with.

13:49.334 --> 13:51.701
All right,
you got it all wrong.

13:51.736 --> 13:53.870
Uh, really wrong.

13:53.905 --> 13:55.938
I pulled a few pranks.

13:55.974 --> 13:57.373
We all do that.

13:57.409 --> 13:58.941
Burning someone
is a prank to you?

13:58.977 --> 14:00.343
She wasn't supposed
to get burned.

14:00.378 --> 14:02.211
Oh, so it was her fault?

14:02.247 --> 14:04.680
All she was supposed to do
was open the damn box,

14:04.716 --> 14:05.882
and a flame pops out.

14:05.917 --> 14:07.049
That's it.

14:07.085 --> 14:09.152
I have done it to her
countless times.

14:09.187 --> 14:11.220
And usually,
she would have caught it

14:11.256 --> 14:12.321
without burning herself.

14:12.357 --> 14:14.223
So why didn't she this time?

14:14.259 --> 14:15.391
I don't know.

14:15.427 --> 14:16.893
She seemed distracted lately.

14:16.928 --> 14:19.295
What do you mean distracted?

14:19.330 --> 14:21.998
Um, leaving early, you know,
not training as hard.

14:22.033 --> 14:24.400
It's as if she lost
her attention to detail.

14:24.436 --> 14:26.502
Now, I-I don't know
what was going on,

14:26.538 --> 14:30.206
but something big was
definitely changing in her life.

14:30.241 --> 14:32.241
Looking at your bio here,
Big Phil.

14:32.277 --> 14:34.444
You had just gotten
the main stage,

14:34.479 --> 14:36.145
and she took it
away from you.

14:36.181 --> 14:38.214
Don't insinuate things.

14:38.249 --> 14:40.683
I didn't hurt that woman.

14:40.718 --> 14:42.552
And whatever fun
I had with her--

14:42.587 --> 14:44.120
listen to me--

14:44.155 --> 14:45.922
she gave it right back.

14:48.026 --> 14:50.092
Your whereabouts
for the past three days,

14:50.128 --> 14:51.327
and I want everything.

14:51.362 --> 14:55.331
So don't lose
your attention to detail.

14:57.302 --> 15:01.037
Dr. Brennan, take a look
at this perimortem damage.

15:01.072 --> 15:03.639
I'm seeing fractures
of the left orbital socket,

15:03.675 --> 15:05.274
maxilla and zygomatic.

15:05.310 --> 15:06.442
Which would suggest that

15:06.478 --> 15:08.077
Klarissa Mott's
face was shattered.

15:08.112 --> 15:09.579
These injuries are severe,

15:09.614 --> 15:11.347
but the lack
of hemorrhagic staining

15:11.382 --> 15:13.583
suggests they were not
the cause of death.

15:13.618 --> 15:15.351
You know, I never saw
Klarissa Mott perform,

15:15.386 --> 15:16.686
but I did attend several shows

15:16.721 --> 15:18.788
at the Magic Palace though
for the last few years.

15:18.823 --> 15:21.224
I had no idea you were
a fan of magic, Dr. Edison.

15:21.259 --> 15:23.426
And I take it you're not.

15:23.461 --> 15:25.328
No, nor of witchcraft,

15:25.363 --> 15:26.896
astrology or the lotto,

15:26.931 --> 15:29.765
all of which require one
to relinquish rational thought.

15:31.102 --> 15:34.203
Oh, Dr. Saroyan,
you're just in time.

15:34.239 --> 15:35.638
Uh, thank you, I suppose.

15:35.673 --> 15:38.608
Klarissa's toxicology results
just came back.

15:38.643 --> 15:41.878
Her liver shows high levels
of the opiate Dilaudid.

15:41.913 --> 15:44.146
That's an extremely
addictive pain killer.

15:44.182 --> 15:47.583
Perhaps this was the huge change
that Big Phil was talking about.

15:51.556 --> 15:55.157
<i> I combed through</i>
<i>Klarissa's bank account</i>

15:55.193 --> 15:57.627
to see if I could get a whiff of
this big shift in her behavior.

15:57.662 --> 15:58.961
For the past few months,
she would withdraw

15:58.997 --> 16:02.465
340 bucks from the same
ATM machine in Glover Park

16:02.500 --> 16:03.933
every Wednesday afternoon.

16:03.968 --> 16:06.435
Glover Park? Boy, that is a,
that's a rough neighborhood.

16:06.471 --> 16:08.871
I'll see if I can get ahold of
that ATM surveillance footage.

16:08.907 --> 16:10.006
Hey, Aubrey.

16:10.041 --> 16:11.607
How do you feel
about the Tooth Fairy?

16:11.643 --> 16:13.409
Excuse me?
Well, Dr. Brennan, you see,

16:13.444 --> 16:16.546
she has a problem giving
Christine a buck for her tooth.

16:16.581 --> 16:18.447
Oh, gotcha.

16:18.483 --> 16:19.549
Maybe she's right.

16:19.584 --> 16:21.450
So you agree with her?

16:21.486 --> 16:24.287
You've always said Dr. Brennan
is a very smart woman.

16:24.322 --> 16:26.389
Yeah, well, what's that have
to do with this?

16:26.424 --> 16:27.557
I'm just saying,

16:27.592 --> 16:29.659
she might know something
that we don't know.

16:29.694 --> 16:31.494
Look, there was a time
when everyone thought

16:31.529 --> 16:33.095
that the world was flat.

16:33.131 --> 16:35.798
It took someone like Dr. Brennan
to tell them they were wrong.

16:35.833 --> 16:38.000
The world changed.

16:41.806 --> 16:44.373
<i>So, Klarissa withdrew</i>

16:44.409 --> 16:48.077
$340 from the ATM
this past Wednesday.

16:48.112 --> 16:50.646
Okay, but what's interesting

16:50.682 --> 16:51.981
is what happens next.

16:52.016 --> 16:54.016
This guy in the black hoodie,

16:54.052 --> 16:56.953
look at what happens
when he leaves.

16:56.988 --> 16:58.588
It's Klarissa.
Yeah.

16:58.623 --> 17:00.756
She's going into that building
behind the ATM.

17:00.792 --> 17:02.992
Can you get me
the address?

17:10.702 --> 17:12.602
Abracadabra.

17:13.805 --> 17:15.972
Ran a background check
on the current tenant

17:16.007 --> 17:17.173
of 331 Oakton.

17:17.208 --> 17:19.008
The guy's name
is Timothy Hodstetter.

17:19.042 --> 17:20.509
He have a rap sheet?

17:20.545 --> 17:21.711
He did a nickel
at Jessup

17:21.746 --> 17:23.145
for dealing
prescription pain meds.

17:23.181 --> 17:26.315
Oh, wow.

17:26.351 --> 17:27.883
Right.

17:31.623 --> 17:33.789
FBI, open up.

17:33.825 --> 17:35.691
FBI!

17:35.727 --> 17:37.893
Get your hands off her now.

17:43.261 --> 17:45.852
Look, we know that Klarissa
came to you for Dilaudid.

17:46.522 --> 17:48.221
I don't know what
you're talking about.

17:48.257 --> 17:50.090
She came to me for
flexibility training.

17:50.125 --> 17:51.725
I'm a coach.
Coach? What kind of coach?

17:51.760 --> 17:54.161
It's called Active
Release Technique.

17:54.196 --> 17:55.796
I use my hands
and my body weight

17:55.831 --> 17:58.865
to loosen muscle,
fascia, tendons.

17:58.901 --> 18:00.333
I work with athletes,

18:00.369 --> 18:02.302
performers, all
types of people.

18:02.337 --> 18:04.070
We also know that she came here
and dropped off,

18:04.106 --> 18:07.107
what, $340 in cash to you
every Wednesday.

18:07.142 --> 18:09.042
Yeah. That's how she paid me,
in cash.

18:09.077 --> 18:10.410
That's how everybody pays me.

18:10.446 --> 18:11.545
Why?

18:11.580 --> 18:12.712
I went away for a bit.

18:12.748 --> 18:13.947
I lost my PT license.

18:13.982 --> 18:15.449
Now I have to work
off the books.

18:15.484 --> 18:17.551
Jesus, you Feds
really got nothing better to do

18:17.586 --> 18:19.586
than to bust my nards about
trying to make a living?

18:19.621 --> 18:21.988
No, we want to bust
your nards for murder.

18:22.024 --> 18:23.423
What are you
talking about?

18:23.459 --> 18:24.758
Klarissa's dead.

18:24.793 --> 18:26.326
She-She's what?

18:26.361 --> 18:27.260
She's dead.

18:27.296 --> 18:29.596
And you think that...

18:29.631 --> 18:31.264
Come on, huh?

18:31.300 --> 18:32.799
I barely knew this woman,
all right?

18:32.835 --> 18:34.534
She came to me asking
for more pliability

18:34.570 --> 18:36.236
in her shoulders and her hips;
that's all she wanted.

18:36.271 --> 18:37.370
She mention any enemies?

18:37.406 --> 18:38.805
Beef with other magicians,
rivals?

18:38.841 --> 18:40.941
No, she was
totally positive.

18:40.976 --> 18:42.409
Completely focused on her work

18:42.444 --> 18:44.110
like a lot of athletes
that I work with.

18:44.146 --> 18:45.146
Really? How about you?

18:45.180 --> 18:46.379
Are you focused on her?

18:46.415 --> 18:48.048
I am totally professional.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.249
I don't sell dope,

18:49.284 --> 18:50.617
and I don't hit on my clients.

18:50.652 --> 18:51.952
Okay, well, we're gonna
take a look around.

18:51.987 --> 18:53.220
Be my guest.

18:53.255 --> 18:55.422
I don't even have cold medicine
in this place.

18:57.926 --> 19:00.060
So I looked
into Klarissa's online

19:00.095 --> 19:01.428
and social media presence.

19:01.463 --> 19:04.130
I found nothing,
but I did find some e-mails

19:04.166 --> 19:05.432
on her laptop.

19:07.903 --> 19:09.469
"You thief. You steal tricks.

19:09.505 --> 19:10.804
"Stay away or else.

19:10.839 --> 19:13.173
Keep poaching, and you'll end up
in the Chesapeake."

19:13.208 --> 19:15.242
Who made these threats?
They're anonymous,

19:15.277 --> 19:16.977
but they all originated

19:17.012 --> 19:19.145
from a public library
in Maryland.

19:19.181 --> 19:20.680
Okay, I'll let Booth know.

19:25.220 --> 19:26.520
Oh.

19:26.555 --> 19:28.555
You can get that.
We're done.

19:28.590 --> 19:30.824
That, it's just
photography advice.

19:30.859 --> 19:32.025
I'm sure it is.

19:32.060 --> 19:33.560
Will you stop?

19:37.399 --> 19:38.565
Hello?

19:38.600 --> 19:40.400
I talked to Lenny at the Palace.

19:40.435 --> 19:43.136
Look, any magicians ever accuse
Klarissa of stealing tricks?

19:43.171 --> 19:44.237
Never. In fact,

19:44.273 --> 19:46.439
Lenny said that he gave Klarissa
his tricks.

19:46.475 --> 19:47.741
That doesn't smell right.

19:47.776 --> 19:49.142
He said he was grateful

19:49.177 --> 19:50.477
to have someone carrying on
his tradition.

19:50.512 --> 19:51.778
Angela cross-referenced

19:51.813 --> 19:53.780
those library e-mails
with the members of the Palace.

19:53.815 --> 19:55.849
You're not gonna believe
what name came up.

19:55.884 --> 19:56.983
Lenny.

19:57.019 --> 19:58.151
Junior.

19:58.186 --> 19:59.653
The guy's kid?

19:59.688 --> 20:00.854
Yeah, let's bring him in.

20:00.889 --> 20:02.088
Call him up, all right?

20:02.124 --> 20:03.924
<i>Dr. Brennan,</i>

20:03.959 --> 20:06.493
I think I found some trauma
on the victim's left ulna.

20:06.528 --> 20:09.596
Yes, it is suggestive
of a defensive wound.

20:09.631 --> 20:12.699
Seems that it's been made
by a sharp object,

20:12.734 --> 20:14.034
perhaps a large blade.

20:14.069 --> 20:16.503
Dr. Edison,
may I ask you a question?

20:16.538 --> 20:17.704
Of course.

20:17.739 --> 20:20.173
I'm curious
about your interest in magic.

20:20.208 --> 20:22.642
Could you explain it to me?

20:22.678 --> 20:25.779
Well, the truth is magic got me
through a really rough patch

20:25.814 --> 20:27.814
in middle school.

20:27.849 --> 20:29.449
Well, adolescence
can be difficult,

20:29.484 --> 20:32.819
particularly for children
of superior intellect.

20:32.854 --> 20:34.688
Dr. Brennan,

20:34.723 --> 20:37.490
would you allow me to perform
a magic trick for you?

20:37.526 --> 20:41.261
I don't think the Jeffersonian
is a place for games.

20:41.296 --> 20:44.631
Please, indulge me for a moment.

20:49.371 --> 20:51.805
It's a little experiment

20:51.840 --> 20:53.807
in weird science.

20:53.842 --> 20:57.477
Observe as I take
this half dollar

20:57.512 --> 21:00.013
and place it in my hand.

21:00.048 --> 21:03.516
I'm about to cause a
little-known anomaly

21:03.552 --> 21:06.419
to the laws of physics.

21:06.455 --> 21:07.954
If I hold this flame

21:07.990 --> 21:09.889
at the right distance
from the coin,

21:09.925 --> 21:13.293
it will completely, somehow,

21:13.328 --> 21:16.830
dematerialize.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.967
Now that you're done,
we can return to our work.

21:21.003 --> 21:22.435
Wouldn't you

21:22.471 --> 21:24.604
like to know how this
magic trick was accomplished?

21:24.640 --> 21:27.641
You never placed the coin
in your left hand.

21:27.676 --> 21:29.776
You simply retained it
in your right hand

21:29.811 --> 21:31.044
behind the fingers.

21:31.079 --> 21:32.912
The lighter had nothing
to do with the trick.

21:32.948 --> 21:35.548
It merely served
as a misdirect

21:35.584 --> 21:37.517
so you could dispose
of the coin in your pocket,

21:37.552 --> 21:39.719
which is where
it is now, correct?

21:46.328 --> 21:49.429
Mm-hmm, I thought so.

21:50.532 --> 21:52.332
<i>I want my son's lawyer here</i>

21:52.367 --> 21:53.900
before he answers
any of your questions.

21:53.935 --> 21:55.702
We can wait, Mr. Jay.
It's up to you.

21:55.737 --> 21:58.271
But Lenny Jay has been
cooperative so far.

21:58.306 --> 22:00.106
He came here
on his own volition,

22:00.142 --> 22:02.308
which could only
be advantageous

22:02.344 --> 22:03.877
to how a judge
views his case.

22:03.912 --> 22:06.146
- Not a word.
- That's fine.

22:06.181 --> 22:08.048
I'm just gonna have
to show the U.S. Attorney

22:08.083 --> 22:11.084
the threatening e-mails that
your son sent to Klarissa Mott.

22:11.119 --> 22:12.752
I know my son.
He's not a killer.

22:12.788 --> 22:14.028
Unlike your stage show,

22:14.056 --> 22:15.755
you can't determine the outcome

22:15.791 --> 22:17.424
of this process in advance.

22:17.459 --> 22:18.858
Your son's gonna be processed

22:18.894 --> 22:20.527
and detained in
a federal lockup.

22:20.562 --> 22:21.628
I mean, do you really want

22:21.663 --> 22:23.296
to watch your son mingle

22:23.331 --> 22:25.732
with a bunch of bad prisoners?

22:33.341 --> 22:34.941
So why'd you do it?

22:34.976 --> 22:37.343
Why'd you send those
threatening e-mails to Klarissa?

22:37.379 --> 22:40.013
I-I got upset.

22:40.048 --> 22:41.981
You know? She was doing
Dad's trick, the Drunken Monkey.

22:42.017 --> 22:43.683
You knew she was working
on the Drunken Monkey?

22:43.719 --> 22:44.918
You were not supposed
to know that.

22:44.953 --> 22:46.286
I-I knew
something was up.

22:46.321 --> 22:47.921
So I started following her.

22:47.956 --> 22:49.589
Could you clarify
something for me, Mr. Jay?

22:49.624 --> 22:51.858
What or who is
a Drunken Monkey?

22:51.893 --> 22:53.326
It's an escapist move

22:53.361 --> 22:55.595
where I'm locked
in a vat of Scotch.

22:55.630 --> 22:58.198
It was my signature trick
20 years ago.

22:58.233 --> 22:59.566
And I gave it to Klarissa.

22:59.601 --> 23:01.301
Yeah, you were supposed
to give it to me.

23:01.336 --> 23:03.336
You said you were
following Klarissa.

23:03.371 --> 23:05.307
How long had you
been stalking her?

23:05.331 --> 23:06.307
I...

23:06.308 --> 23:08.041
I wasn't stalking her, okay?

23:08.076 --> 23:09.943
I-I followed her for a few days

23:09.978 --> 23:12.512
until I built up the courage
to confront her.

23:12.547 --> 23:15.381
That's not good enough for me. Let's go.
Well...

23:15.417 --> 23:16.352
Well, what about the guy
that she was kissing?

23:16.376 --> 23:17.485
Wait a second.

23:17.486 --> 23:19.719
You saw Klarissa
kissing someone?

23:19.755 --> 23:21.121
Yeah, I-I was waiting
outside the Palace

23:21.156 --> 23:22.722
two days ago,
before her show started,

23:22.758 --> 23:24.390
and some guy dropped her off.

23:24.426 --> 23:25.658
I-I don't know who he was.

23:25.694 --> 23:26.826
Tell them who he was.

23:26.862 --> 23:28.561
You need to.
Dad, I-I...

23:28.597 --> 23:30.130
really don't know. Okay?

23:30.165 --> 23:31.965
I-I've never seen him before.

23:40.323 --> 23:43.024
Dr. Edison, please re-examine
the area around

23:43.059 --> 23:44.726
the sharp force trauma
on the left ulna.

23:44.761 --> 23:46.094
Of course.

23:46.129 --> 23:49.264
Specifically, eight
millimeters upward

23:49.299 --> 23:50.798
from that nick.

23:50.834 --> 23:53.902
Okay. I see a small
indentation on the ulna.

23:53.937 --> 23:55.336
I believe this mark

23:55.372 --> 23:57.872
and the previous mark
were made simultaneously.

23:57.908 --> 24:00.575
Which suggests they were
both the result

24:00.610 --> 24:03.178
of one blow from
a single weapon.

24:03.213 --> 24:07.182
Well, the first mark was made
at a 94-degree angle

24:07.217 --> 24:09.184
and the second one is...

24:09.219 --> 24:10.885
135 degrees.

24:10.921 --> 24:12.520
This couldn't have been a knife.

24:12.556 --> 24:14.455
Maybe the corner of an object?

24:14.491 --> 24:16.558
Make that the corner
of a sharp alloy object.

24:16.593 --> 24:18.326
So I swabbed the wound
for particulates.

24:18.361 --> 24:20.428
I found
interstitial alloy metals:

24:20.463 --> 24:22.063
steel, manganese and nickel.

24:22.098 --> 24:24.065
Excellent work, Dr. Hodgins.
Thanks.

24:24.100 --> 24:25.767
Yeah, I'm gonna
cross-check these alloys

24:25.802 --> 24:27.035
against potential
murder weapons.

24:27.070 --> 24:28.536
Oh, wait!
Before you do, uh,

24:28.572 --> 24:29.771
I have another, uh,

24:29.806 --> 24:31.046
magic trick
to show Dr. Brennan.

24:31.074 --> 24:32.273
If you'll allow me to.

24:32.309 --> 24:33.675
I think we're done

24:33.710 --> 24:35.109
with magic at work, Dr. Edison.

24:35.145 --> 24:36.811
The Jeffersonian

24:36.846 --> 24:39.681
is the home of truth
and scientific inquiry.

24:39.716 --> 24:41.716
Actually, he showed
me this one,

24:41.751 --> 24:43.818
and I'm pretty sure you're not
gonna be able to figure it out.

24:43.853 --> 24:46.120
Proceed.

24:49.593 --> 24:52.961
I call this one...

24:52.996 --> 24:55.396
The Vanishing Spoon.

24:55.432 --> 24:56.798
Ooh.

24:57.901 --> 25:00.902
Behold
a beaker of water.

25:02.606 --> 25:04.639
A teaspoon.

25:06.009 --> 25:10.378
If I put it in the water

25:10.413 --> 25:12.513
and concentrate hard enough...

25:17.887 --> 25:19.487
...it'll disappear.

25:20.690 --> 25:22.857
The spoon is
made of gallium.

25:22.892 --> 25:24.392
You've got to be kidding me.

25:24.427 --> 25:26.427
You blew the trick.
I most certainly did not!

25:26.463 --> 25:28.096
I molded you
the perfect spoon!

25:28.131 --> 25:29.597
Gallium melts
at 86 degrees.

25:29.633 --> 25:31.399
You obviously
warmed the water

25:31.434 --> 25:32.867
just enough
so it wouldn't steam.

25:32.902 --> 25:34.135
You cover the beaker
with your hand

25:34.170 --> 25:36.838
to conceal
the chemical process

25:36.873 --> 25:40.875
of the solid spoon
turning to liquid metal.

25:42.212 --> 25:44.379
Are we done with
magic tricks now?

25:44.414 --> 25:46.547
Oh. Look.

25:46.583 --> 25:49.417
You made Dr. B disappear.

25:54.658 --> 25:56.090
Cam.

25:56.126 --> 25:57.825
Sebastian.

25:57.861 --> 25:59.327
You're here.

25:59.362 --> 26:01.029
Yes, I was just
dropping off

26:01.064 --> 26:02.003
some prints to Angela
at her office and, um...

26:02.027 --> 26:02.998
Yeah.

26:02.999 --> 26:05.600
Prints that you could've
easily had delivered.

26:05.635 --> 26:07.101
I think we both really know

26:07.137 --> 26:08.336
why you're coming around.

26:08.371 --> 26:11.472
Wow.
That's, uh... forward.

26:11.508 --> 26:14.575
I guess I should just
come clean and admit

26:14.611 --> 26:16.110
I was hoping to run into you.

26:16.146 --> 26:17.445
Me?

26:17.480 --> 26:18.880
I wanted to see

26:18.915 --> 26:20.581
if you'd have dinner
with me tonight.

26:20.617 --> 26:21.783
Oh.

26:21.818 --> 26:24.118
I see.

26:24.154 --> 26:25.353
I'm sorry.

26:25.388 --> 26:27.088
We just had
such a good talk

26:27.123 --> 26:28.790
at the gallery,
I just thought...

26:28.825 --> 26:30.658
No, it-it's...

26:30.694 --> 26:32.794
I mean, I would love to...

26:32.829 --> 26:35.263
I-I...

26:36.633 --> 26:39.067
I just got out of
a serious relationship

26:39.102 --> 26:40.501
and I'm not really ready.

26:40.537 --> 26:41.803
Sorry.

26:41.838 --> 26:43.171
Don't be.

26:43.206 --> 26:44.772
Just bad timing.

26:44.808 --> 26:46.140
Exactly.

26:47.777 --> 26:50.311
Well, if you ever
change your mind,

26:50.347 --> 26:51.746
you know how to find me.

26:55.752 --> 26:57.118
Okay.

27:14.804 --> 27:17.338
Okay. One coffee,

27:17.374 --> 27:19.440
two cream.
Thanks, Cam.

27:19.476 --> 27:21.676
You're welcome.

27:24.214 --> 27:26.280
What's wrong?

27:26.316 --> 27:28.483
Nothing.

27:29.753 --> 27:31.652
It's about Sebastian.

27:31.688 --> 27:32.987
Oh...

27:33.022 --> 27:34.722
Like I told you,

27:34.758 --> 27:36.424
he is strictly
a mentor.

27:36.459 --> 27:38.793
He just asked me out.

27:38.828 --> 27:40.628
Oh.

27:40.663 --> 27:42.697
I-I... He wanted
to go out for dinner.

27:42.732 --> 27:43.898
I said no,

27:43.933 --> 27:45.666
but I just thought
I should tell you.

27:45.702 --> 27:48.236
Oh, okay. Why?

27:48.271 --> 27:51.005
I don't know.
You two are close.

27:51.040 --> 27:54.142
There is nothing going on
between Sebastian and I.

27:54.177 --> 27:56.210
I mean, I'm a happily
married woman.

27:56.246 --> 27:57.945
I know that.

27:57.981 --> 28:00.648
So, um, what-what's
really going on?

28:02.552 --> 28:04.085
I don't...

28:04.120 --> 28:05.586
I...

28:07.223 --> 28:08.556
I mean...

28:10.994 --> 28:14.662
I don't think
I'm over Arastoo yet.

28:14.697 --> 28:17.031
Yeah. Well...

28:17.066 --> 28:19.200
it takes time.

28:21.971 --> 28:25.506
But isn't it nice that
someone is interested?

28:25.542 --> 28:27.575
I mean, especially
a good-looking guy like that?

28:27.610 --> 28:29.644
Good-looking and that accent.

28:29.679 --> 28:31.846
Oh, so you did notice.

28:31.881 --> 28:34.382
Ooh.

28:34.417 --> 28:36.584
Yeah.

28:36.619 --> 28:38.286
Well, I'm sure after being

28:38.321 --> 28:40.788
with somebody great,
like Arastoo,

28:40.824 --> 28:42.657
it's just all
a little foggy

28:42.692 --> 28:44.625
as to what you're supposed
to do next, right?

28:44.661 --> 28:46.360
Well, that's just it.

28:46.396 --> 28:50.598
I... What if I don't get back
what I had with Arastoo?

28:50.633 --> 28:52.300
Yeah.

28:52.335 --> 28:54.101
Honestly?

28:54.137 --> 28:56.070
You might not.

28:58.508 --> 29:01.776
But you definitely won't
if you don't try.

29:10.253 --> 29:14.255
<i>So I spoke to a dozen or so</i>
<i>members of the Magic Palace</i>

29:14.290 --> 29:15.890
<i>about Klarissa's dating life.</i>

29:15.925 --> 29:17.758
No one remembers
Klarissa dating anyone,

29:17.794 --> 29:20.294
but her super said
that she had some flowers

29:20.330 --> 29:21.496
sent to her
a few weeks ago.

29:21.531 --> 29:22.797
Flowers?
All right, okay.

29:22.832 --> 29:25.500
Well, who sent them?
He had no idea.

29:25.535 --> 29:27.468
Okay, you're getting
that look on your face.

29:27.504 --> 29:28.836
What look?

29:28.872 --> 29:30.671
The look that says
you want me to call

29:30.707 --> 29:32.347
every single florist
in Montgomery County.

29:32.375 --> 29:33.674
You're good. You're right.
You know what?

29:33.710 --> 29:35.309
You're right.
I do have that look.

29:37.747 --> 29:40.281
<i>You wanted to show me</i>
<i>something, Dr. Edison?</i>

29:40.316 --> 29:42.250
Yes. I reconsidered
the damaged hyoid

29:42.285 --> 29:44.018
we dismissed earlier.
And?

29:44.053 --> 29:46.654
And I have located

29:46.689 --> 29:48.322
some bone bruising

29:48.358 --> 29:51.292
and microfractures of the
greater cornua of the bone.

29:51.327 --> 29:54.695
Dr. Edison, you just
found cause of death:

29:54.731 --> 29:56.831
ligature strangulation.

29:59.969 --> 30:02.637
Maybe it's good for Cam
to start seeing other people.

30:02.672 --> 30:04.939
Well, it's only been a few months
since she and Arastoo split.

30:04.974 --> 30:06.440
So?

30:06.476 --> 30:08.843
What, you think
it's too soon?

30:08.878 --> 30:10.945
You don't?

30:10.980 --> 30:12.246
Well, I would want you
to move on

30:12.282 --> 30:13.781
if something happened with us.

30:13.816 --> 30:14.982
No, you wouldn't, okay?

30:15.018 --> 30:16.417
People, they say that
all the time.

30:16.452 --> 30:17.985
That's not gonna happen.
Plus, what...

30:18.021 --> 30:19.153
what's going to happen to us?
Well, anything.

30:19.188 --> 30:21.589
Divorce. Disease.

30:21.624 --> 30:23.558
Uh, mental illness.

30:23.593 --> 30:25.426
The fact that our work

30:25.461 --> 30:26.661
is extremely dangerous.

30:26.696 --> 30:28.963
Look what happened to Sweets.

30:28.998 --> 30:30.498
What happened
with you and your brother.

30:30.533 --> 30:31.966
Ah, just stop, all right?

30:32.001 --> 30:33.467
You know what?
You're depressing me, now.

30:33.503 --> 30:35.202
Well, I would think
in any of those scenarios,

30:35.238 --> 30:37.204
you would want me to be happy.

30:37.240 --> 30:40.007
Oh. Oh, no, I don't...

30:40.043 --> 30:43.010
I don't like the idea of you
with another guy.

30:44.514 --> 30:45.713
Hold on, that's Cam.

30:45.748 --> 30:47.448
Go ahead, Cam.

30:47.483 --> 30:49.617
I re-examined some neck tissue

30:49.652 --> 30:51.786
that I thought had been bruised
by animal predation.

30:51.821 --> 30:55.590
Turns out, the marks were caused
by acute urticaria.

30:55.625 --> 30:56.691
Mm, that mean something?

30:56.726 --> 30:58.192
It means she had hives.

30:58.227 --> 30:59.493
Klarissa was suffering

30:59.529 --> 31:01.629
from an allergic reaction.
When she died?

31:01.664 --> 31:03.497
It's the only way
they'd still be on her skin.

31:03.533 --> 31:04.932
What was she allergic to?

31:04.968 --> 31:06.467
Her medical records show

31:06.502 --> 31:08.469
she had a life-long
allergy to fungus.

31:08.504 --> 31:10.004
Fungus. Wait... wait a second.

31:10.039 --> 31:11.606
Uh... truffles are fungus.

31:11.641 --> 31:12.907
Yeah, why?

31:12.942 --> 31:14.108
Klarissa's roommate's boyfriend.

31:14.143 --> 31:15.710
Victor Cornachio?

31:15.745 --> 31:17.278
Yeah, he was cooking

31:17.313 --> 31:19.313
with some fancy truffle oil
in her apartment.

31:19.349 --> 31:21.624
So maybe he was cooking and...

31:21.659 --> 31:23.659
Reached around her neck

31:23.695 --> 31:25.261
and killed her.

31:25.296 --> 31:26.963
I think we might have found

31:26.998 --> 31:29.190
Klarissa's mystery lover.

31:31.669 --> 31:33.561
Take a look at this, Victor.

31:33.596 --> 31:35.162
What is it?

31:35.198 --> 31:38.232
Your fancy truffle oil
was on Klarissa's neck.

31:38.267 --> 31:40.901
I left that oil
at Anna's place.

31:40.937 --> 31:42.637
Klarissa probably used it
to make an omelette.

31:42.672 --> 31:43.904
The only problem
with that

31:43.940 --> 31:45.406
is that Klarissa
had an allergy.

31:45.441 --> 31:46.707
She wouldn't go
near the stuff.

31:46.743 --> 31:49.276
So how did it
end up on her neck?

31:50.346 --> 31:52.079
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

31:52.115 --> 31:53.923
Come on, Victor.

31:53.958 --> 31:57.093
Look, what really happened
between you and Klarissa, huh?

31:57.128 --> 31:59.395
Did she threaten to tell your
girlfriend about the affair?

31:59.430 --> 32:00.998
I don't know what
you're talking about.

32:01.022 --> 32:01.732
I have an eyewitness

32:01.733 --> 32:04.967
who saw you kissing Klarissa
in front of the Palace.

32:05.003 --> 32:07.403
Okay, look, the truffle oil

32:07.438 --> 32:08.838
might have gotten
on her neck that night.

32:08.873 --> 32:11.874
How?

32:11.909 --> 32:13.242
When we kissed.

32:13.277 --> 32:16.278
I dropped her off before
her show at the Palace.

32:16.314 --> 32:19.215
We were supposed to meet up
at her place later that night...

32:19.250 --> 32:20.616
but she never showed up.

32:20.651 --> 32:21.851
You didn't text her

32:21.886 --> 32:23.319
or ask her why?

32:23.354 --> 32:24.553
It was casual.

32:24.589 --> 32:26.222
Sometimes
we would meet up,

32:26.257 --> 32:27.590
sometimes plans
would change.

32:27.625 --> 32:29.025
If it was so casual,

32:29.060 --> 32:30.526
then why'd you
send her flowers?

32:30.561 --> 32:32.328
What flowers?

32:32.363 --> 32:35.197
So someone else
sent them.

32:35.233 --> 32:37.233
Maybe you found out

32:37.268 --> 32:38.968
about this other guy
and got jealous.

32:39.003 --> 32:41.003
I don't know
about anyone else.

32:41.039 --> 32:42.738
And I wouldn't care
if I did.

32:42.774 --> 32:46.108
What Klarissa and I had
was just sex.

32:46.144 --> 32:48.077
Really good sex.

32:48.112 --> 32:51.047
The only thing that
she really loved was her work.

32:51.082 --> 32:52.415
And I was fine with that.

32:52.450 --> 32:54.116
Did your girlfriend know
about all this?

32:54.152 --> 32:56.118
There's a chance
she caught on to it.

32:56.154 --> 32:58.020
Why do you say that?

32:58.056 --> 32:59.455
Last week, when I came
out of the shower,

32:59.490 --> 33:01.457
I saw that my phone
had been turned on.

33:01.492 --> 33:04.894
I could see that there was
something off about Anna.

33:04.929 --> 33:06.662
She was looking for something.

33:06.697 --> 33:08.664
She find it?

33:08.699 --> 33:10.666
Not on my phone.

33:10.701 --> 33:12.668
Careful about this stuff.

33:15.621 --> 33:17.621
We learned that your boyfriend
was having an affair

33:17.656 --> 33:19.155
with Klarissa Mott.

33:19.191 --> 33:20.490
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

33:20.726 --> 33:21.691
No, not at all.

33:21.727 --> 33:23.092
You have to be
kidding me.

33:23.156 --> 33:25.523
Kidding? No, we don't do that.

33:25.558 --> 33:28.259
Victor told us that you
went through his phone.

33:28.294 --> 33:30.928
Oh. He did.

33:30.963 --> 33:32.396
So you found out
about the affair,

33:32.431 --> 33:34.899
and that's why you
killed Klarissa.

33:34.934 --> 33:36.267
No.

33:36.302 --> 33:38.302
Well, yeah, I did find out
about the affair,

33:38.337 --> 33:39.670
but I didn't kill her.

33:39.705 --> 33:42.439
I just didn't want to hurt
our business, so I...

33:42.475 --> 33:44.408
chose to look
the other way.

33:44.443 --> 33:46.844
So are you saying that
you were okay with that?

33:46.879 --> 33:48.479
No, I wasn't okay with it.

33:48.514 --> 33:50.381
But I invested my life
in this catering business.

33:50.416 --> 33:51.715
I'm not going to throw it away

33:51.751 --> 33:53.350
because Vic can't keep it
in his pants.

33:54.654 --> 33:56.587
So we also checked out
your alibi.

33:56.622 --> 33:58.689
Now, you said that you were
at the convention.

33:58.724 --> 33:59.990
Which is true.

34:00.026 --> 34:01.425
But what you
didn't tell us

34:01.460 --> 34:03.294
is that you left
a day early.

34:03.329 --> 34:06.163
When we brought your boyfriend
in, we looked into his finances,

34:06.199 --> 34:09.199
and we found your catering
company credit card.

34:09.235 --> 34:11.902
You bought gas and
groceries in Washington

34:11.938 --> 34:14.505
the night Klarissa was murdered.

34:18.511 --> 34:20.911
I wasn't sure they were
having an affair,

34:20.947 --> 34:22.880
so I wanted to see for myself.

34:22.915 --> 34:24.782
That's why I lied
about coming home early.

34:24.817 --> 34:26.382
You lied about your
knowledge of the affair,

34:26.418 --> 34:27.985
you lied about
when you came home.

34:28.020 --> 34:30.420
I'll tell you what, Anna,
all this lying is adding up,

34:30.456 --> 34:32.523
and it's not looking
good for you.

34:37.797 --> 34:39.830
You have something to
show me, Dr. Edison?

34:39.864 --> 34:42.166
Yes, after learning the
victim was asphyxiated,

34:42.201 --> 34:45.235
I decided to reexamine
the mandible.

34:45.271 --> 34:47.004
A logical next step.

34:47.039 --> 34:50.040
Now, do you notice the
sequential pattern here?

34:50.076 --> 34:51.475
It looks
like bone bruising.

34:51.510 --> 34:52.876
On the right side
of the mandible.

34:52.911 --> 34:54.745
Now, I've measured
the distance

34:54.780 --> 34:56.547
between each
impression.

34:56.581 --> 34:59.883
34.5 millimeters,
equidistant.

34:59.919 --> 35:02.886
Perhaps these marks were made
by the same alloy object

35:02.922 --> 35:04.521
that injured
Klarissa's ulna.

35:04.557 --> 35:07.391
Have Hodgins swab
for particulates.

35:09.629 --> 35:11.428
Found the flower shop.

35:11.464 --> 35:13.297
Creative Blossoms of
Silver Spring, Maryland.

35:13.332 --> 35:14.732
Okay, who sent them?

35:14.767 --> 35:17.401
Not gonna believe this one--
the Gold Pearl Casino.

35:17.436 --> 35:20.137
Wait a second, the casino in Vegas?
The message on the card read,

35:20.172 --> 35:22.039
"We at the Gold Pearl
couldn't be more excited

35:22.074 --> 35:24.108
to know that our casino
will be your new home."

35:24.143 --> 35:25.509
I'll be damned.

35:25.544 --> 35:27.878
She was taking a new job.

35:27.913 --> 35:29.580
Where you going?

35:29.615 --> 35:31.815
Going to see the person this
would have pissed off most.

35:37.156 --> 35:39.890
Dr. Hodgins, what is
all this doing in the lab?

35:39.925 --> 35:42.760
Oh, hey, it's a select
trove of objects culled

35:42.795 --> 35:44.962
from the Jeffersonian's
wide world of magic.

35:44.997 --> 35:47.264
Well, that much
is apparent.

35:47.300 --> 35:48.766
Yeah, we scoured
the institution's archives,

35:48.801 --> 35:50.834
and we pulled out
memorabilia, devices.

35:50.870 --> 35:52.269
In an effort
to find the weapon

35:52.305 --> 35:53.771
that may have killed
Klarissa Mott.

35:53.806 --> 35:55.205
I don't recall there
being any kerf marks

35:55.241 --> 35:56.540
on the victim's bones.

35:56.575 --> 35:58.008
Perhaps,
but this is the saw

35:58.044 --> 35:59.677
that Harry Blackstone Sr.,

35:59.712 --> 36:01.312
first used to cut
a woman in half.

36:01.347 --> 36:02.713
And check this out.

36:02.748 --> 36:04.048
These are the
bullets caught

36:04.083 --> 36:06.483
by Robert-Houdin 150 years ago,

36:06.519 --> 36:09.186
and still, to this day, no one
has any idea how he did it.

36:09.221 --> 36:11.021
This is all entirely useless.

36:12.525 --> 36:13.924
You are both grown men

36:13.959 --> 36:15.492
and, to the best of my
knowledge, scientists.

36:15.528 --> 36:19.630
Please tell me that despite
your enthusiasm for magic,

36:19.665 --> 36:20.864
you have discovered
something of value

36:20.900 --> 36:22.700
that can help move
this case forward.

36:22.735 --> 36:25.035
All right, well, I did swab the
bruised areas of the mandible,

36:25.071 --> 36:26.870
and I found traces
of the same alloy

36:26.906 --> 36:28.339
that was in the trauma
to the left ulna.

36:28.374 --> 36:30.774
So the damage on
the ulna and mandible

36:30.810 --> 36:32.109
were both caused
by the same weapon?

36:32.144 --> 36:33.477
Yeah, according to
the Mass Spec, yes.

36:33.512 --> 36:35.612
But the ulna was cut
by a sharp-edged object

36:35.648 --> 36:37.548
and the damage on
the mandible was inflicted

36:37.583 --> 36:39.450
by something with
a blunt surface.

36:42.755 --> 36:45.823
Finally, I'm seeing
something useful.

36:50.129 --> 36:52.296
I remember seeing
this lock and chain

36:52.331 --> 36:55.099
in Lenny Jay's
memorabilia cabinet.

36:55.134 --> 36:58.001
He had the arrogance
to display it in full view.

36:58.037 --> 37:00.070
Okay, let's see
if I can enhance it.

37:01.407 --> 37:03.807
Hmm, the padlock's
edges appear to be

37:03.843 --> 37:05.909
the same angles as the cut
on the victim's arm.

37:05.945 --> 37:07.544
That is my hypothesis.

37:07.580 --> 37:10.414
Okay, well, I've already
scanned Klarissa Mott's bones,

37:10.449 --> 37:12.549
so let's go full-skeleton.

37:13.853 --> 37:15.953
We need to see
if these angles correspond

37:15.988 --> 37:18.422
to the padlock's
dimensions.

37:18.457 --> 37:21.425
Okay, well, there's only
one way to find that out.

37:26.265 --> 37:27.965
It's a perfect match.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.034
Now, please see
if the chain links line up

37:31.070 --> 37:32.870
with the damage to the mandible.

37:32.905 --> 37:34.204
Okay, that should work.

37:34.240 --> 37:36.740
Let me rearrange
the sequence of events.

37:36.776 --> 37:39.743
Okay, so the killer swung
the lock and chain,

37:39.779 --> 37:43.814
and a sharp corner of the
padlock cut Klarissa's left arm.

37:43.849 --> 37:45.849
Which she was holding up
to protect herself.

37:45.885 --> 37:47.684
Then the killer
wrapped the weapon

37:47.720 --> 37:50.988
around Klarissa's neck
and strangled her.

37:51.023 --> 37:54.191
She fell to the floor,
landing on her face,

37:54.226 --> 37:56.760
causing the damage to
the maxilla and zygomatic.

37:56.796 --> 37:58.562
We need that lock and chain,

37:58.597 --> 38:00.297
but Lenny Jay must have
gotten rid of it.

38:00.332 --> 38:02.466
Perhaps not,
he's arrogant.

38:02.501 --> 38:04.568
Solely due to his aptitude
for trickery,

38:04.603 --> 38:06.703
he thinks he's smarter than us.

38:10.476 --> 38:13.310
I don't see why
you want to look at it.

38:13.345 --> 38:14.645
Uh, please be careful.

38:14.680 --> 38:16.079
Don't worry,
we'll do our best

38:16.115 --> 38:17.881
to handle the situation
here correctly

38:17.917 --> 38:19.249
because we are trained
professionals.

38:19.285 --> 38:21.151
Isn't that right, Bones?
Yes.

38:21.187 --> 38:22.753
Right, see, that's
our little magic wand.

38:22.788 --> 38:24.354
What do we got,
anything?

38:24.390 --> 38:26.223
It's been cleaned.
Cleaned. You are clever, Lenny.

38:26.258 --> 38:28.959
Not really, I just like to take
good care of my collectibles.

38:28.994 --> 38:30.961
But, you see, cleverness
has another side to it.

38:30.996 --> 38:31.929
Oh, really? What is that?

38:31.964 --> 38:33.730
Overconfidence.
Yeah.

38:33.766 --> 38:34.898
The key.

38:36.368 --> 38:38.101
You cleaned the lock,

38:38.137 --> 38:41.605
but you were unable to wipe
down the internal casings.

38:41.640 --> 38:43.640
Because the key was
found inside Klarissa.

38:43.676 --> 38:45.375
She had it in her mouth.

38:45.411 --> 38:47.010
That's the only way you
could do the Drunken Monkey.

38:47.046 --> 38:48.479
Stands to reason
that she swallowed the key

38:48.514 --> 38:49.813
when you attacked her.

38:49.849 --> 38:51.582
That was beyond
your control,

38:51.617 --> 38:54.651
so you couldn't manipulate
it to further your deceit.

38:56.555 --> 38:58.121
Hmm.

38:59.925 --> 39:04.261
This clotting matches the exact
frequency of luminescence

39:04.296 --> 39:08.465
of the blood sampling extracted
from Klarissa Mott's remains.

39:11.303 --> 39:12.769
Hmm, gotcha.

39:16.942 --> 39:19.142
I gave Klarissa everything.

39:19.178 --> 39:21.111
I gave her her start.

39:21.146 --> 39:23.213
I-I gave her
her best material.

39:23.249 --> 39:24.448
L-Look, these were things

39:24.483 --> 39:26.016
that I didn't even share
with my own son.

39:26.051 --> 39:28.886
And she promised me
that she would spend

39:28.921 --> 39:31.321
her entire career
here at the Palace.

39:31.357 --> 39:33.090
Now, I invested
a lot in that girl.

39:33.125 --> 39:34.525
And she broke her
promise to you.

39:34.560 --> 39:35.893
She did.
All right, so then you hit her

39:35.928 --> 39:37.160
with the chain and
you strangled her.

39:37.196 --> 39:38.662
I just got so angry.

39:38.697 --> 39:40.964
I-I... I-I was out of control.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.666
But, you see,
it was her fault.

39:42.701 --> 39:44.201
Why did she break
her promise?

39:44.236 --> 39:46.236
Let's go.
Why did she break her promise?

39:49.074 --> 39:52.910
♪ In July, in July, in July ♪

39:52.945 --> 39:57.147
♪ I burned all your things ♪

39:58.951 --> 40:02.319
♪ And they glow, and they glow,
and they glow ♪

40:02.354 --> 40:06.156
♪ And the fire still sings... ♪

40:06.191 --> 40:09.159
Come on, the frequency
of luminescence?

40:09.194 --> 40:11.962
I mean, even I knew that was a
bunch of bull you fed Lenny Jay.

40:11.997 --> 40:15.933
In the time it takes to get
a DNA sample from that lock,

40:15.968 --> 40:17.935
he could have prepared
a different story.

40:17.970 --> 40:19.336
I thought it was
best to confront him

40:19.371 --> 40:20.871
when his guard
was down.

40:20.906 --> 40:22.372
You tricked him.

40:22.408 --> 40:23.540
Just say it, you little devil.

40:23.576 --> 40:25.142
Say it: you tricked
the magician.

40:25.177 --> 40:28.779
Occasionally, a touch of
deception goes a long way.

40:28.814 --> 40:32.549
Bones, even you are capable
of a little magic.

40:32.585 --> 40:35.018
Which is why I slipped a dollar
under Christine's pillow

40:35.054 --> 40:36.820
when I kissed her good night.

40:36.855 --> 40:38.722
See? A little mystery
is good for the soul.

40:40.859 --> 40:43.060
What do you have there?

40:43.095 --> 40:46.897
Oh, I'm just finishing up some
paperwork on the Lenny Jay case.

40:46.932 --> 40:49.032
Oh, perfect.

40:51.203 --> 40:53.570
No, what are you doing?
I want you to behold

40:53.606 --> 40:56.540
the... mystery...

40:56.575 --> 40:58.709
of the disappearing
document.

40:58.744 --> 41:00.711
Don't you dare.
Booth. Booth!

41:00.746 --> 41:03.981
That document has the signatures
of three U.S. attorneys on it.

41:06.518 --> 41:08.652
Whoa.

41:09.822 --> 41:11.555
Whoa, take a look
in your pocket.

41:11.590 --> 41:13.924
What?
There you go.

41:14.560 --> 41:16.326
What? No...

41:16.362 --> 41:17.661
Yeah.

41:19.431 --> 41:20.797
No.

41:20.833 --> 41:22.399
Booth.

41:24.536 --> 41:25.936
How did you do that?

41:25.971 --> 41:27.611
I did that very well,
thank you very much.

41:28.941 --> 41:30.140
There must be a
logical explanation

41:30.175 --> 41:31.408
for this amateur trick.

41:31.443 --> 41:34.411
I put this shirt on
when I got home...

41:34.446 --> 41:36.213
Well, I grabbed it
right from the dryer.

41:36.248 --> 41:38.715
A little mystery
is good for the soul.

41:38.751 --> 41:40.651
Did you plant it
in the dryer?

41:40.686 --> 41:43.320
Well, you were at work,
so how did you...?

41:43.355 --> 41:46.356
Bones, a magician never
reveals his secrets.

42:19.091 --> 42:22.426
Sebastian, hi, it's Cam Saroyan.
