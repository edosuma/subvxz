00:01.084 --> 00:02.204
Previously on Grimm...

00:03.337 --> 00:04.777
- Bye, Nick.
- Goodbye, Juliette.

00:08.717 --> 00:10.094
They came in from
everywhere.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.777
It was professional.
They grabbed Trubel.

00:11.803 --> 00:13.283
I tried to stop them.
They drugged me.

00:13.347 --> 00:16.021
When I woke up, Juliette's body
was gone and my mom's head.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.225
They took everything.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.312
Baby's heart rate's dropped.
What's happening?

00:20.395 --> 00:22.068
We're gonna have to do
an emergency C-section.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.741
No matter what's happened, this
child is going to need you.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.944
Don't hate me
anymore, Nick.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.871
For our son's sake,
we can't be like we were.

00:29.947 --> 00:31.870
This is your
one chance to get the answers.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.371
They're coming here.

00:33.909 --> 00:35.536
They're rising.

00:38.497 --> 00:39.498
It's war.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.911
No. No, no, no, no.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.493
What the hell?

01:17.995 --> 01:19.372
Wemlinger.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.127
Mr. Childs, what are
you still doing here?

01:21.206 --> 01:22.378
We have a problem.

01:22.457 --> 01:23.925
Nearly a half a million
dollars is missing.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.754
Missing?
What do you mean "missing"?

01:26.837 --> 01:28.180
It's gone,
that's what I mean!

01:28.255 --> 01:29.973
Half a million dollars
in reinvested dividends

01:30.048 --> 01:31.721
was not credited back
to the shareholders!

01:31.800 --> 01:33.017
There must be some
mistake.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.265
I went through every
account

01:34.344 --> 01:35.470
There's no mistake.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.431
Someone is
falsifying the data.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.562
Numbers have been altered,
capital gains diverted.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.893
But, how?

01:40.976 --> 01:43.320
I don't know, but I need you to
get a forensic accountant in here

01:43.395 --> 01:44.435
to go through every
account

01:44.479 --> 01:46.322
I can start going
through the data right now.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.492
No, we have to go
outside the firm for this.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.486
Oh.
I'm gonna call the police.

01:50.569 --> 01:53.072
Put together a list of everyone
with access to our files.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.411
Um...

01:57.034 --> 01:58.957
- Portland Police, please.
- Is this an emergency?

01:59.036 --> 02:01.960
No, it's not an emergency. I need
the fraud-embezzlement department.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.131
Sir.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.261
I think I know
who's responsible.

02:08.878 --> 02:09.880
Who?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.632
I've got it all right here.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.649
There's nothing here.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.177
911.
What is your emergency?

02:53.256 --> 02:54.348
They killed him!

02:55.592 --> 02:57.469
They killed my boss!

02:57.552 --> 02:58.974
Oh God, it's terrible!

02:59.054 --> 03:00.306
Are you hurt, sir?

03:00.389 --> 03:01.606
Please! Please come quick!

03:01.682 --> 03:04.982
Sir, help is on its way. I need
you to calm down and... Hello?

03:21.868 --> 03:22.960
Nick.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.223
How are they?

03:39.302 --> 03:40.929
Sleeping. Everyone seems fine.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.059
Well, thank God for that.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.641
How are you holding up?

03:44.474 --> 03:45.475
Chavez is dead.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.103
What?

03:47.185 --> 03:48.277
Oh, man, Nick,
you didn't...

03:48.353 --> 03:49.354
No, I didn't kill her.

03:49.438 --> 03:50.860
Well, who did?
Wesen.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.156
There were four others
we were supposed to meet.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.950
They were dead
when we got there.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.242
Chavez gave me this.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.614
Doesn't this belong to Trubel?
Yeah.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.916
Chavez knew where Trubel was.
She say where?

04:00.991 --> 04:02.163
No,
we never got that far.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.835
First, I have to go back
and figure out who did this.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.537
I'm going with you.
Me too.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.964
Let's go. I'll stay with
Adalind and the baby.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.211
Kelly.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.669
She wanted
to name him Kelly.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.262
Oh, Nick,
that's a good name.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.007
Let's go.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.441
This is the old Shaver's
Transportation Company.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.821
This is where
she brought you?

04:35.901 --> 04:37.027
Bodies are inside.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.908
Let's make sure
nobody else is.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.795
So, these people you were
supposed to meet, any idea who they were?

04:46.870 --> 04:47.996
No.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.127
Chavez said
something was coming,

04:50.207 --> 04:51.709
that we needed to be
prepared.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.044
Prepared for what?

04:55.253 --> 04:56.345
An uprising.

05:07.724 --> 05:08.816
The bodies were
right here.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.144
Are you sure?
Yes.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.317
I killed a Gelumcaedus
right where you're standing.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.487
And, Chavez died
right here.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.073
Ground is still wet.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.659
Wait a minute, are you saying
somebody came back here,

05:21.738 --> 05:23.536
took the bodies and
cleaned up all the blood?

05:23.615 --> 05:25.663
Somebody went to a lot of
trouble to cover this up.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.710
Yeah, just like
they did with Juliette.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.717
This is Chavez' phone.
It rang right after she died.

05:34.793 --> 05:37.763
It was a man's voice.
I told him she was dead.

05:37.838 --> 05:38.964
What'd he say?

05:39.047 --> 05:40.048
He said for me
to keep the phone.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.179
I'll run the last number,
see what I can find.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.306
Any of them get away?

05:43.385 --> 05:45.934
Yeah, one. Uh, up those
stairs, out the back.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.605
There was a truck
waiting for 'em.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.059
Old Blazer,
black, silver, jacked up.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.393
Where'd you see it?

05:51.476 --> 05:52.477
This way.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.775
Truck was waiting here,
took off fast.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.659
Couldn't see the plates.

06:00.819 --> 06:03.038
Uh, not going to get any
surveillance out here.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.365
Are we thinking
these are the same guys

06:04.447 --> 06:05.619
that came back
to clean up, or...

06:05.699 --> 06:08.452
No, I'm thinking this was
whoever was on that phone,

06:08.535 --> 06:10.378
the people Chavez
was working for.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.546
Wait a minute.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.136
Someone painted it.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.216
Say what?

06:23.300 --> 06:24.552
On that wall,
there was a mark.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.728
Four black lines.
Someone painted over it.

06:28.638 --> 06:29.810
It's still wet.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.809
Why would they do that?

06:32.350 --> 06:34.148
Someone didn't want
anybody to see it.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.614
Anyone else
thinking conspiracy here?

06:39.941 --> 06:41.621
Do we need to bring
the Captain in on this?

06:42.444 --> 06:43.604
Not until we figure this out.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.198
I think we should
probably get out of here

06:46.281 --> 06:48.784
before someone tries to,
like, paint over us.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.046
Where's Kelly?

07:43.171 --> 07:45.048
Adalind, it's okay.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.850
The nurse took him to the nursery
so you could get some sleep.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.387
Oh.

07:50.762 --> 07:51.854
Right.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.146
I must've had a bad dream.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.465
Everything's
all right.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.395
You should try to
go back to sleep.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.742
How you feeling?

08:05.276 --> 08:06.823
Okay, I think.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.351
Kelly's in the nursery.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.364
I know.

08:10.407 --> 08:11.533
I was just there.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.707
Thanks for staying,
but you should go home.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.629
Monroe's waiting for you.
Okay.

08:16.705 --> 08:17.752
I'll walk you out.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.959
Be right back.
Mmm-hmm.

08:25.797 --> 08:26.798
What happened?

08:27.590 --> 08:28.807
Nothing was there.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.553
The bodies were gone.
Somebody cleaned up.

08:31.636 --> 08:32.852
Nothing more about Trubel?

08:32.929 --> 08:33.929
Nothing.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.900
The doctor told Adalind
she could go home tomorrow.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.602
Are you bringing her
back to your place?

08:41.062 --> 08:42.735
I have to.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.196
I've got no place else
to take her.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.243
Monroe and I will come over
first thing in the morning.

08:47.318 --> 08:48.798
We'll try to get
things ready for you.

08:49.946 --> 08:50.947
Thanks.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.415
Yeah.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.459
Adalind had the baby.

09:02.917 --> 09:03.964
It's a boy.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.633
Healthy?
Yeah.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.471
I wonder if anyone will ever tell him
the truth about how he got here.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.847
Not gonna be me.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.222
I just thought
you should know.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.932
Hey, Hank,
I'm going to partner you up

09:17.015 --> 09:18.562
with Pogue until
Nick gets back.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.185
I don't need a partner.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.066
Well, Pogue does.
Meacham's on vacation.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.572
But he has no idea
what's going on.

09:24.647 --> 09:25.648
Make it work.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.572
Did you tell him?

09:28.651 --> 09:29.652
He told me.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.659
Well, don't get too excited.
We just got a body.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.341
Wu.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.379
Hank.
Pogue.

09:47.462 --> 09:48.805
What do we got?
Where's the body?

09:50.298 --> 09:52.266
We got a dead body,
and it's right this way.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.720
Victim is Mr. Beau Childs,
CEO of the company.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.898
Margin clerk Paul Wemlinger
heard screams, ran in,

09:57.972 --> 10:00.191
saw two men running out,
called 911.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.768
We're checking
security cameras now.

10:06.523 --> 10:07.820
Damn. What got him?

10:12.237 --> 10:13.917
How many people were here
when it happened?

10:14.447 --> 10:16.074
Just the victim and
Wemlinger as far as I know.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.285
Wemlinger called the victim's
assistant, Betty Frame.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.540
She just got here.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.745
Blood on the phone.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.047
Let's talk to the witness.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.844
Mr. Wemlinger, I'm Detective Griffin.
This is Detective Pogue.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.929
Can you tell us
what happened?

10:31.131 --> 10:32.724
I was working late.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.473
I didn't even know that Mr.
Childs was still in the office.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.981
I heard screams.
It was awful.

10:40.348 --> 10:41.474
What did you see?

10:41.558 --> 10:44.983
I saw two men running
from Mr. Childs' office.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.109
Can you describe them?

10:47.188 --> 10:50.067
They were both
wearing ski masks.

10:51.025 --> 10:54.154
One of them might have been bigger
than the other one, I don't know.

10:55.697 --> 11:02.205
And, um, one of them was holding
some kind of a stick or a weapon.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.288
I can't be sure.

11:04.747 --> 11:05.919
Did you go after them?

11:06.583 --> 11:07.584
No.

11:08.877 --> 11:09.878
I was scared.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.681
I went in
Mr. Childs' office,

11:13.756 --> 11:18.057
tried to stop the bleeding, but
there was nothing I could do.

11:18.553 --> 11:19.554
You called 911.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.181
Yes.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.359
What did you do to try
to stop the bleeding?

11:24.434 --> 11:28.064
I put my hands on
Mr. Childs' throat.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.899
And, I tried to give him
mouth to mouth.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.700
But there was
just so much blood.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.282
I think he was already dead.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.408
And you washed your hands?

11:36.487 --> 11:37.909
Yeah, I tried to get
the blood off.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.543
I don't think
I got it all.

11:43.494 --> 11:46.418
Just a couple more questions, Mr.
Wemlinger.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.759
When did you call
Mr. Childs' assistant?

11:50.835 --> 11:52.212
Betty?

11:52.295 --> 11:55.469
Just right after. I didn't
know what else to do.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.138
Any idea who would do this? No.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.304
I don't know who would do
such a thing, it's just...

12:03.973 --> 12:05.475
I'm sorry.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.341
You might want
to talk to Betty.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.822
She knows a lot more about
his personal life than I do.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.783
Okay, just sit tight,
Mr. Wemlinger.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.288
We buying his story?

12:19.989 --> 12:22.333
Does he look like a guy who
could rip someone's throat out?

12:24.327 --> 12:26.455
It's hard to know
what's inside somebody.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.755
I can't believe
this is happening.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.212
Betty, how long have
you worked with Mr. Childs?

12:34.295 --> 12:35.888
17 years.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.513
Mr. Wemlinger said he called
you just after it happened.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.592
He did.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.017
He was very upset.
I came right over.

12:43.346 --> 12:44.973
How would you describe
the relationship

12:45.056 --> 12:47.104
between Mr. Childs and
Mr. Wemlinger?

12:47.183 --> 12:48.480
Very professional.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.647
We all got along
so well here.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.444
Excuse me a moment.

13:02.532 --> 13:03.579
Checked security cameras.

13:03.658 --> 13:06.127
No one seen coming or going in
the last three and a half hours

13:06.202 --> 13:08.330
except for us and her.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.960
Wemlinger was alone
with the victim.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.963
The way the vic was killed,
this has got to be Wesen.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.047
Can't wait
to explain that to Pogue.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.930
I'll come visit you in the
Psych Ward every Tuesday.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.520
Simon Willard had an easier
time building his banjo clock

13:27.598 --> 13:29.145
than I am with this thing.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.226
Banjo clock?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.910
Yeah, it was the first commercially
successful American wall clock

13:32.979 --> 13:35.607
to have the pendulum suspended
in front of the weight case

13:35.690 --> 13:37.818
and the weight attached
to a pulley.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.447
Yes, but could
he build a baby mobile?

13:39.527 --> 13:41.495
Not with these instructions
he couldn't.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.163
Mmm.
He's going to love it.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.046
Maybe someday.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.259
Oh, my God.

14:02.842 --> 14:03.843
You did all this?

14:04.260 --> 14:06.513
Well, it's not as if
you two had the time.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.019
And I picked up a few
things for the new mom too.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.600
That is so sweet of you.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.065
Oh, let me see.

14:13.144 --> 14:14.521
Oh, he's so cute.

14:14.604 --> 14:15.605
Yeah.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.689
Mmm-hmm.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.277
Why don't I show you
where everything is.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.114
Thanks for doing this.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.461
Look, Nick,
I gotta be honest.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.335
I have sort of a bad
feeling about this.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.540
They're my responsibility.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.503
I'm not talking about Adalind and Kelly.
I'm talking about this house.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.255
Too many bad things
have gone down here, man.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.807
Too much death
and destruction.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.556
I'm just sayin', you might
want to think about,

14:45.635 --> 14:47.729
you know,
a change of venue.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.056
You mean, move?

14:49.138 --> 14:51.186
Oh, I mean get
the hell out of here.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.226
I think
it's time we went home.

14:53.309 --> 14:58.531
Yeah, we should let you
two, you three get settled in.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.566
If you need anything, I can
be here in 10 minutes.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.240
You guys have
both been really...

15:03.736 --> 15:05.830
Uh... Thank you.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.831
I should probably get some
rest before Kelly wakes up.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.461
He'll be hungry.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.212
Where should I...
Oh, guest room, upstairs.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.255
I'll get Kelly.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.487
The last time I was in this
room, it was with Diana.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.322
I hope she's okay.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.524
Yeah, me too.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.990
Have you heard
anything about Juliette?

15:49.574 --> 15:50.575
She's dead.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.328
What? Oh, my God!

15:54.162 --> 15:57.041
Trubel killed her
to save my life.

15:59.041 --> 16:02.796
Oh, Nick, I thought she
got away with the Royals.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.051
No, she never left.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.549
I'm so sorry.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.764
Thank you for doing this.

16:48.758 --> 16:49.850
Wow.

16:50.092 --> 16:53.096
Thanks, uh, but I need
a little bit of help.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.265
Can you?
Of course.

17:16.117 --> 17:18.212
Got anything on Wemlinger?
'Cause I don't.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.506
Background's clean.
No record anywhere.

17:20.580 --> 17:21.798
Anything on prints yet?

17:22.415 --> 17:23.541
It's still processing.

17:23.626 --> 17:24.877
I think we should
bring him in.

17:24.961 --> 17:25.962
Why?

17:27.296 --> 17:30.300
He said he saw two guys run
out, blood all over the office.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.136
But, we've got no blood trail and
nothing on security cameras.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.434
The security cameras don't
cover the back stairway.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.633
They must've known that.
Well, then how'd they get in?

17:37.890 --> 17:39.062
No sign of a break-in.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.269
If Wemlinger did it,
where's the murder weapon?

17:41.644 --> 17:43.612
He sure as hell didn't do it
with his bare hands.

17:44.981 --> 17:48.030
I think we should bring him
in, sweat him a little.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.571
All right, if you think
it's worth something.

17:58.119 --> 17:59.166
What are you doing up?

17:59.245 --> 18:00.246
I couldn't sleep.

18:00.997 --> 18:04.001
Anyway, doctor said I should
walk as much as I can, so...

18:04.959 --> 18:05.960
What about Kelly?

18:06.335 --> 18:07.712
Oh, he's sleeping fine.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.761
I'm making some sandwiches.
Would you like one?

18:11.674 --> 18:13.472
Yeah, anything.

18:13.551 --> 18:14.848
Ham and cheese okay?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.270
Sounds perfect.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.767
Lettuce, tomato, mayo?

18:17.847 --> 18:19.190
I'm allergic to tomato.

18:19.682 --> 18:20.854
That's good to know.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.614
So, lam thinking
of selling the house.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.109
Oh.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.827
Find us someplace safer.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.201
We're going with you?

18:35.323 --> 18:37.246
Yeah, if you'd like.

18:38.868 --> 18:39.869
Sure.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.338
This is really good.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.686
Is there anything else
you're allergic to?

18:51.839 --> 18:54.012
Just raw tomatoes.
I can eat 'em cooked.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.936
I actually make
a pretty good Bolognese.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.354
I like Bolognese.

18:58.429 --> 18:59.669
I actually make
a pretty mean...

19:01.599 --> 19:02.600
Sorry.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.396
Hank.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.899
You home?
Uh-huh.

19:09.982 --> 19:10.983
You Okay?

19:11.067 --> 19:12.444
Yeah. What's up?

19:12.526 --> 19:14.904
I hate to bug you, but I
might have a Wesen problem.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.489
I need you to confirm.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.451
I'm bringing the suspect in. Any
chance you can make it down here?

19:19.533 --> 19:21.331
Uh, what time?
Half hour.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.504
Hank needs me to
get to the precinct.

19:23.579 --> 19:24.705
We'll be fine.

19:26.207 --> 19:27.299
I'll be right there.

19:33.756 --> 19:36.305
If you need anything,
just call.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.606
Okay, thank you.
You bet.

19:51.232 --> 19:52.529
Wemlinger's
in interrogation.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.610
Take a look
at this M.E. report first.

19:55.403 --> 19:56.746
"Victim's throat
was torn out by,

19:56.821 --> 19:58.619
"what appears to be,
some kind of an animal."

19:59.490 --> 20:01.163
I don't think
Wemlinger's an animal.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.334
Probably not.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.410
Our killers must've had
some kind of a garden tool.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.421
You know, one of those claw things.
Maybe.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.509
Let's go talk to Wemlinger.

20:10.584 --> 20:11.881
Do you know something
I don't?

20:11.961 --> 20:13.463
'Cause I don't see how this
guy could have done that.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.638
Just a gut feeling.

20:14.714 --> 20:15.931
All right. It's your gut.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.098
Hold on.
Just got the prints back.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.099
Got a hit on your suspect.
Wemlinger?

20:21.178 --> 20:23.897
AKA Simon Kincaid.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.776
Wanted for embezzling $975,000

20:26.851 --> 20:28.945
from the Bankers Trust in
Sacramento three years ago.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.487
Doesn't make him
a murderer.

20:30.563 --> 20:33.066
But, it certainly
puts him at the party.

20:33.149 --> 20:35.117
I'm starting to feel it
in my gut too.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.581
You and Mr. Childs were working
pretty late last night.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.038
You always work that late?

20:43.492 --> 20:44.664
Depends on the work.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.625
We stay 'till it's done.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.012
What were you
working on last night?

20:50.082 --> 20:51.925
Getting out
the quarterly reports.

20:52.001 --> 20:54.220
We have 217 clients.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.468
Why was Mr. Childs there
so late?

20:57.089 --> 21:00.184
I don't know.
He was the boss.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.853
He was under
a lot of pressure.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.745
You have access to
all the accounts?

21:05.723 --> 21:07.817
Yes. But,
I'm not the only one.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.610
Any money missing
from the company?

21:09.685 --> 21:11.562
No.
You sure about that.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.527
As far as I know.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.234
Isn't it your job to know?

21:16.317 --> 21:19.912
My job covers a wide range
of responsibilities.

21:20.863 --> 21:23.707
You ever heard of Bankers
Trust in Sacramento?

21:24.700 --> 21:26.418
Maybe you've heard
of Simon Kincaid.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.753
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.046
Yeah, you do.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.625
You were stealing money
from C&E Investments,

21:32.708 --> 21:34.051
just like you were stealing
from Bankers Trust.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.548
I was not!

21:35.628 --> 21:38.507
I told you, there were two
other men inside. I saw them.

21:38.589 --> 21:39.886
Security cameras didn't.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.967
Mr. Childs found out what you
were doing, and you killed him.

21:42.051 --> 21:43.644
No, no!

21:43.928 --> 21:46.681
You're Simon Kincaid, and we
have fingerprints to prove it!

21:48.057 --> 21:50.059
And, I know you're Wesen.

22:00.402 --> 22:02.621
You don't know what
you're talking about.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.824
And, I want to talk
to a lawyer.

22:07.743 --> 22:08.869
Give him his call.

22:13.415 --> 22:14.792
Did he Woge?
Yeah.

22:15.626 --> 22:17.378
I think he's a Quijada Vil.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.259
Have we dealt with one?
No, but I've read about 'em.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.011
Capable of
ripping a throat out?

22:21.090 --> 22:22.182
Oh, yeah.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.306
So, we know he did it.
We just can't prove it.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.397
What're you doing here,
Nick?

22:29.473 --> 22:30.474
Thought you were
takin' time off.

22:30.558 --> 22:32.777
I asked him to observe while
we were questioning Wemlinger.

22:32.852 --> 22:33.978
You think he's going to
see something I don't?

22:34.061 --> 22:35.341
It's got nothing
to do with that.

22:35.396 --> 22:36.818
No, no, no,
I want to hear.

22:36.897 --> 22:37.989
Did I miss something?

22:38.065 --> 22:39.567
You got something for me
to book this guy on?

22:39.650 --> 22:41.368
Take it easy.
All I'm saying is,

22:41.443 --> 22:43.696
you want to bring
another guy in, tell me.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.531
But, right now,
we got bigger problems.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.116
Two U.S. Marshals
just got here.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.416
What do they want?

22:48.492 --> 22:49.584
Our suspect.

22:57.251 --> 22:59.754
Hey, I'm Detective Griffin.
This is Detective Pogue.

22:59.837 --> 23:00.884
Dan Reeves, Ray Durant.

23:00.963 --> 23:02.556
We got a hit on Simon
Kincaid this morning.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.133
Guess you know him
as Paul Wemlinger.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.220
He's wanted in Sacramento. We're
taking him back to California.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.350
That's the warrant.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.389
He's a suspect
in a murder case.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.566
Sorry, guys. He's ours now.

23:13.142 --> 23:14.314
Where is he?

23:15.019 --> 23:16.487
Right this way.

23:21.901 --> 23:22.981
We can't let them take him.

23:23.027 --> 23:24.028
They have a warrant.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.580
And no idea what
they're dealing with.

23:26.655 --> 23:27.747
I gotta warn them.

23:27.823 --> 23:28.995
How you gonna do that?

23:29.450 --> 23:30.451
Nick.

23:32.369 --> 23:33.541
Hey, you guys got a minute?

23:34.830 --> 23:35.956
I'm Detective Burkhardt.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.041
What?

23:37.458 --> 23:38.898
You have to be
careful with this guy.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.466
I think we can handle him.
No, you don't understand.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.468
He's not what he seems.
We know all about him.

23:43.797 --> 23:46.175
No, you don't.
This guy, he's dangerous.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.218
He's an ink man.
What's he gonna do,

23:48.302 --> 23:49.428
forge us to death?

23:53.682 --> 23:55.322
You don't know what
this guy's capable of.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.612
You know, Detective, just
'cause we got babysitting duty,

23:58.687 --> 24:00.064
doesn't give you
the right to bust our balls.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.227
I'm not bustin' your balls.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.274
You a badass?

24:04.526 --> 24:06.369
Let's go, man.

24:24.672 --> 24:26.595
You can't stop them.
I can follow them.

24:26.674 --> 24:27.971
All the way to Sacramento?

24:28.050 --> 24:29.176
Whatever it takes.

24:29.259 --> 24:31.219
What part of "take time
off" don't you understand?

24:31.261 --> 24:33.355
Sorry, Captain. I had no
choice but to bring him in.

24:33.806 --> 24:37.686
Marshals picked up our murder suspect
for a prior, and he's Wesen.

24:37.768 --> 24:39.488
They have no idea what
they're dealing with.

24:40.229 --> 24:41.856
Where they taking him?
California.

24:42.231 --> 24:44.484
I have to go after them.
In my office.

24:55.119 --> 24:56.336
You want to lose your job?

24:56.412 --> 24:57.664
They're not gonna
make it to Sacramento.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.168
You've already
screwed up with the FBI.

24:59.248 --> 25:00.545
You want the marshals
on your ass too?

25:00.624 --> 25:02.304
After what this guy
did to his last victim,

25:02.334 --> 25:03.974
I wouldn't want to ride
in a car with him.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.678
I can call
the marshals' office,

25:11.760 --> 25:13.353
tell them there's a death
threat on their fugitive.

25:13.429 --> 25:14.829
They'll beef up security
themselves.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.225
Now, go home, and don't come
back until you hear from me.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.071
What?

25:31.155 --> 25:32.452
This job is hard enough.

25:35.117 --> 25:36.835
It's even harder
when you know what's going on

25:36.910 --> 25:38.628
and you can't do
a damn thing about it.

25:43.834 --> 25:46.212
This an okay time?
Yeah, he just ate.

25:46.295 --> 25:48.138
I'm trying to get him
back to sleep.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.592
Just came by to see
if you needed anything.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.933
Nick here?
No. He's at work.

25:55.679 --> 25:58.228
It's a little weird getting
used to being here again.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.275
I can't even imagine.
Don't.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.227
Do you want to see him?
Sure.

26:06.648 --> 26:09.197
Oh, he really
is a handsome guy.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.578
He's been pretty good
so far.

26:11.653 --> 26:12.870
How about you?

26:12.946 --> 26:15.620
Oh, I don't know.

26:15.783 --> 26:19.663
I'm really happy about him and
being a mom again, but...

26:20.287 --> 26:22.585
Nick?
No. Nick's been great.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.086
And I didn't
expect him to be great,

26:24.166 --> 26:25.588
and that makes it
even greater.

26:26.168 --> 26:27.886
As long as it lasts.

26:28.670 --> 26:30.217
He's not going to
walk away from this.

26:30.297 --> 26:33.892
Not now, but what happens
when I turn back?

26:34.760 --> 26:36.200
The suppressant
doesn't last forever.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.763
Sooner or later...

26:37.846 --> 26:40.599
I know. I've been thinking
about the same thing.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.360
I don't want to be
a Hexenbiest again.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.449
Seriously?

26:49.525 --> 26:52.779
I was not very nice,
I know that.

26:53.529 --> 26:58.626
But, I can't do that
to him or Nick,

26:59.243 --> 27:00.961
after what happened
to Juliette.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.289
Maybe it won't come back.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.625
It will come back.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.300
Maybe not in the same way.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.049
I don't want it in any way.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.005
What we did makes it
too unpredictable.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.299
I don't mean
to scare you off,

27:14.383 --> 27:17.102
but, you're
the only friend I have.

27:19.346 --> 27:20.689
I'm not scared at all.

27:22.474 --> 27:26.524
I just want a normal life,
like what you and Monroe have.

27:26.603 --> 27:28.697
I'd hardly say what
we have is normal.

27:28.772 --> 27:32.117
Yeah, but you have each other, and
that comes before everything else.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.908
You and Nick have something
you both love.

27:37.698 --> 27:39.200
That's a really good start.

27:41.368 --> 27:43.621
Did Nick tell you what
happened to Juliette?

27:43.704 --> 27:44.751
Trubel killed her.

27:45.539 --> 27:47.337
What happened to Trubel?

27:47.416 --> 27:48.918
We don't know.

27:51.378 --> 27:52.630
Are you expecting anyone?

27:52.713 --> 27:54.010
No.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.261
Then let me get it.

28:00.762 --> 28:02.264
May I help you?

28:15.652 --> 28:17.654
You want something from inside?
Yeah, grab me a juice.

28:17.738 --> 28:18.785
All right.

28:19.364 --> 28:22.288
Can I use the bathroom?
It's such a long ride.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.044
I got him.

28:26.371 --> 28:27.372
Let's go.

28:31.793 --> 28:34.512
Don't forget
he's a dangerous guy.

28:34.588 --> 28:35.885
So I've been told.

28:39.176 --> 28:41.019
All right.
Do what you got to do.

28:41.136 --> 28:43.605
Can you please take these off?
No.

28:43.680 --> 28:44.897
And the door stays open.

29:08.038 --> 29:09.164
Hey, boss.

29:10.624 --> 29:12.672
I'm just gassing up,
about to get on the 405.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.838
Nobody said anything
about a death threat.

29:18.215 --> 29:19.933
All right,
we'll wait for 'em.

30:00.757 --> 30:03.306
We can't let this guy go down
for just embezzlement.

30:03.385 --> 30:04.511
We need to find
the murder weapon.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.141
This is aggravated murder!

30:06.221 --> 30:08.690
Hank and I have to go back
and tear that office apart.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.142
The murder weapon,
it's got to be there.

30:10.225 --> 30:11.602
He never left that office.

30:11.685 --> 30:15.030
All right, any idea what kind
of weapon Wemlinger used?

30:15.105 --> 30:16.732
We think
it was a garden tool.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.535
The marshals just got hit.
What?

30:20.610 --> 30:22.362
Gas station on
Southwest Barnes.

30:22.446 --> 30:23.618
Wemlinger?

30:23.697 --> 30:24.698
Don't know.

30:40.464 --> 30:41.511
What's going on?

30:44.217 --> 30:45.497
Is there someplace
we could talk?

30:47.179 --> 30:48.522
We'll go upstairs.

31:01.401 --> 31:02.402
What's the problem?

31:02.611 --> 31:04.238
Agent Chavez is missing.

31:04.321 --> 31:07.416
Didn't show up for work,
hasn't returned calls.

31:07.491 --> 31:09.539
How long has it been?
Since last night.

31:09.618 --> 31:12.963
The argument you had in her
office, what was it about?

31:13.038 --> 31:14.039
She didn't tell you?

31:14.122 --> 31:15.169
Why don't you tell us?

31:17.292 --> 31:18.652
I thought she was
investigating me.

31:19.669 --> 31:20.921
Not sure I follow.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.381
The Weston Steward case.

31:23.799 --> 31:25.972
He was killed
right in this room.

31:26.843 --> 31:28.311
She always thought
I was involved.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.039
We weren't still
working that case.

31:31.098 --> 31:32.315
Well, maybe you weren't.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.899
She interrogated me at the precinct.
Did she tell you that?

31:36.978 --> 31:38.446
We went by her house
today.

31:38.522 --> 31:40.399
There were signs of
a struggle in her bedroom.

31:43.652 --> 31:44.904
Where were you last night?

31:44.986 --> 31:46.829
You got to be kiddin' me.
Where were you?

31:47.489 --> 31:49.583
At the hospital.
Not feeling well?

31:49.658 --> 31:51.660
I was helping deliver my son.
You just met him.

31:54.704 --> 31:56.126
Would you like
the doctor's name?

31:57.999 --> 32:02.004
If you had anything to do with
Agent Chavez' disappearance,

32:02.087 --> 32:03.680
it's just a matter of time.

32:07.801 --> 32:09.519
Congratulations on your baby.

32:19.813 --> 32:22.362
Hey, Hank, Pogue.
This is bad.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.615
Where are the bodies?
Restroom.

32:25.694 --> 32:26.786
It's bloody.

32:26.862 --> 32:29.786
Marshals are all over this. They're
pissed, and I don't blame 'em.

32:29.865 --> 32:32.118
You got any idea
who they were transporting?

32:32.200 --> 32:33.622
'Cause he must be a badass.

32:34.411 --> 32:35.833
Watch your step.

32:47.382 --> 32:48.554
Holy mother.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.993
Is everything okay?

33:07.068 --> 33:08.069
Yeah.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.197
Why was the FBI here?

33:10.739 --> 33:12.161
It just had to do
with an old case.

33:13.575 --> 33:16.499
Okay.
I don't like this, Nick.

33:17.078 --> 33:18.876
If something happens
to you...

33:18.955 --> 33:20.753
I have Kelly,
but I have no job,

33:20.832 --> 33:22.709
I have nowhere to live,
no place to raise him.

33:22.792 --> 33:25.420
I mean, what if he's like me?
What if he's like you?

33:25.504 --> 33:27.177
What if he's some weird
combination of both of us

33:27.255 --> 33:28.723
like some kind of
HexenGrimm or Grimmabiest.

33:28.798 --> 33:30.971
I can't do this alone!
It's gonna be okay.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.272
I'm... I'm sorry.

33:37.265 --> 33:39.438
I really don't expect
anything from you.

33:40.936 --> 33:43.280
I just don't want anything
to happen to you.

33:49.903 --> 33:51.997
I got to take this.
Okay. I know.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.869
Marshals never
got out of Portland.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.496
Well, where's Wemlinger?
We don't know.

33:59.579 --> 34:01.923
They stopped to get gas,
happened in the bathroom.

34:01.998 --> 34:03.545
I knew I should've
gone after them.

34:04.459 --> 34:06.132
There's something else.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.300
Same marks
you showed us last night.

34:08.630 --> 34:10.882
What?
Just texted you a photo.

34:18.514 --> 34:19.983
Yeah,
those are the same marks.

34:20.559 --> 34:23.608
So, Wemlinger is tied to
whoever killed Chavez?

34:23.687 --> 34:24.904
I don't know, but if it is,
it could be tied to

34:24.980 --> 34:26.777
whatever Chavez was
trying to warn me about.

34:26.856 --> 34:28.904
Could also be tied to
Trubel's disappearance.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.827
We know he was embezzling.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.824
If we find the money, we might
be able to find Wemlinger.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.326
Chances are,
he's still in Portland.

34:34.656 --> 34:37.455
It's not gonna be easy to move
with everybody looking for him.

34:37.534 --> 34:40.413
Forensic accountants are going
through the books at C&E right now.

34:40.495 --> 34:42.213
Pogue will be stuck here
for a while.

34:42.289 --> 34:43.666
I'll meet you there.

34:53.882 --> 34:56.181
It looks like most
of the money has been wired

34:56.261 --> 34:57.763
from the corrupted accounts

34:57.846 --> 35:01.942
to offshore banks in the Bahamas,
the Caymans, and Puerto Rico.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.940
First transaction took place
March of two years ago.

35:04.019 --> 35:05.942
Can you get names and
socials on the accounts?

35:06.021 --> 35:08.115
We have to go through the Feds on that.
I wouldn't hold my breath.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.782
We know the origin
of the transfers?

35:10.025 --> 35:12.824
Wemlinger's
computer, made between

35:12.902 --> 35:15.155
2:30 and 3:30 a.m.
every other Tuesday.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.957
Now, this may or may not
mean something,

35:18.033 --> 35:19.785
but every time
there was a data transfer,

35:19.868 --> 35:22.496
a phone call was made from
here to a Portland number.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.001
The number's
listed right there.

35:35.258 --> 35:38.137
So, the phone number
belongs to the company.

35:38.219 --> 35:39.471
Got a billing address?

35:39.554 --> 35:41.147
Yep. It's a P.O. Box.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.065
So, we don't know
who he's making the calls to.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.142
Well, you might not,

35:44.225 --> 35:46.478
but I was able to triangulate
the Tuesday night calls,

35:46.561 --> 35:47.983
and each time a call was made,

35:48.063 --> 35:51.317
the phone that received those
calls was at this location.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.743
It's an apartment
building on Northwest 19th.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.491
We know anyone there?
Yep.

35:56.029 --> 35:59.659
Betty Frame, the victim's assistant.
Apartment 502.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.494
That's why Wemlinger called
her after he killed Childs.

36:02.577 --> 36:03.874
They could be working
together.

36:03.953 --> 36:05.170
Wemlinger might be there.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.498
Let's find out.

36:28.770 --> 36:29.896
I hear something.

36:33.108 --> 36:35.736
Electric motors,
a lot of them.

36:40.782 --> 36:41.999
Portland police!

36:45.120 --> 36:46.121
What was that?

36:50.834 --> 36:52.757
Move, and I'll kill her!

36:52.836 --> 36:55.180
I'll rip her throat out!

37:05.432 --> 37:06.433
Watch the hall.

37:09.185 --> 37:12.564
Help me! Help me! He made me do it.
He made me do it.

37:12.647 --> 37:14.194
He made me help him!

37:14.274 --> 37:15.400
I'll take the stairs!

37:15.483 --> 37:17.326
He's some kind of animal.

37:17.402 --> 37:18.995
Stay here.

37:22.031 --> 37:23.453
He jumped out the window.

37:51.770 --> 37:52.942
Follow him.

38:16.419 --> 38:17.420
Behind you!

38:59.254 --> 39:01.006
Stop! Stop!

39:15.270 --> 39:16.613
I had no choice.

39:17.772 --> 39:19.115
Stay here. Call it in.

39:29.284 --> 39:30.456
What are you doing?

39:32.745 --> 39:34.463
She's deleting the files.

39:34.539 --> 39:36.541
Get away
from the computer. Now!

39:38.126 --> 39:40.845
Not even a Grimm can
stop what's coming.

39:44.465 --> 39:47.560
Occultatum Libera!

39:59.439 --> 40:00.986
"Occultatum Libera?"

40:01.065 --> 40:02.905
Uh-huh. Yeah, that was
the last thing she said.

40:03.276 --> 40:07.452
Uh, loosely translated, it
would mean something like,

40:07.530 --> 40:10.500
free what's hidden
or free the hidden.

40:12.619 --> 40:13.619
What does that mean?

40:13.661 --> 40:16.335
I guess it depends on who's
hidden or what's hidden.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.883
It's got to be whatever group
uses this as its symbol.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.427
Yeah, we're still
working on that.

40:21.502 --> 40:24.005
There have been a lot of funky Wesen
symbols over the years, so...

40:24.088 --> 40:26.932
Horns, hooves,
eyeballs, tails,

40:27.008 --> 40:29.932
representing everything from
death to fertility to war.

40:30.011 --> 40:31.979
Here we got
the Reaper's Scythe,

40:32.055 --> 40:33.932
the Hundjaeger's
Verrat tattoo.

40:34.015 --> 40:37.360
Let's not forget my personal
favorite, the Wolfsangel,

40:38.353 --> 40:40.401
which still
gives me nightmares.

40:40.480 --> 40:43.484
Unfortunately, nothing so
far that looks like that.

40:48.404 --> 40:50.532
What the hell does it mean?

41:00.208 --> 41:01.728
it doesn't make sense.

41:02.585 --> 41:03.802
Sure.

41:03.878 --> 41:06.006
Wemlinger and Betty
were in it together.

41:06.089 --> 41:08.387
Working from the inside,
stealing lots of money,

41:08.466 --> 41:09.513
skimming percentages.

41:09.592 --> 41:10.672
Yeah, yeah, I get all that.

41:10.718 --> 41:12.470
But, she didn't kill anybody.

41:12.553 --> 41:13.600
So, why did she jump
out the window?

41:13.680 --> 41:15.478
Wemlinger was dead.

41:15.556 --> 41:17.316
