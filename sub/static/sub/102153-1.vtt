00:05.943 --> 00:09.193
(bright melodic music)

02:02.673 --> 02:03.956
- Why are you doing this?

02:03.956 --> 02:05.797
(eerie music)

02:05.797 --> 02:07.350
- Once I win this contest,

02:07.350 --> 02:09.680
I'll have enough money
to buy us a nice wedding.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.150
- You don't have to Paul.

02:11.150 --> 02:12.450
I love you no matter what.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.260
- Babe, it's not like that.

02:16.260 --> 02:18.150
My fans, they expect more out of me.

02:18.150 --> 02:21.250
Like I'm almost at 3 million followers.

02:21.250 --> 02:23.700
- Babe, haven't you made enough?

02:23.700 --> 02:26.960
- Money, money doesn't last forever.

02:26.960 --> 02:27.980
- It could.

02:27.980 --> 02:28.813
- Trust me.

02:31.260 --> 02:32.530
- You read the clause,

02:32.530 --> 02:34.487
you're way past three times.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.400
(bright melodic music)

02:36.400 --> 02:37.393
- Don't jinx me.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.490
- Maybe you should wait a bit.

02:41.490 --> 02:42.513
You look exhausted.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.003
- Baby, I got this.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.686
I love you.

02:48.686 --> 02:49.673
- I love you too.

02:49.673 --> 02:51.173
- I'll call you when I'm done.

03:12.790 --> 03:15.747
- Hello everyone and thank
you for following me.

03:15.747 --> 03:18.840
Today, I will be performing my most

03:18.840 --> 03:20.863
death-defying stun up today.

03:25.242 --> 03:27.742
(eerie music)

03:31.242 --> 03:34.492
(bright melodic music)

04:04.717 --> 04:07.634
(sobbing bitterly)

04:16.188 --> 04:18.938
(screams loudly)

04:36.363 --> 04:39.446
(low brooding music)

04:42.020 --> 04:43.512
- Detective Brooks.

04:43.512 --> 04:45.080
- Yeah.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.783
- I think my fiancé was murdered.

04:50.062 --> 04:50.895
- Have a seat.

04:52.820 --> 04:53.840
- Thank you.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.590
I flew all the way here from China.

04:56.970 --> 05:00.043
- Woo man, your arms must be tired.

05:01.690 --> 05:02.593
- I don't get it.

05:03.501 --> 05:04.601
- That was a bad joke.

05:07.370 --> 05:08.203
Yeah.

05:09.380 --> 05:11.943
So, where are you staying?

05:13.040 --> 05:14.810
- I'm staying in a hotel Downtown.

05:14.810 --> 05:15.643
- Downtown.

05:16.630 --> 05:18.250
All right, just be careful Downtown

05:18.250 --> 05:20.423
because there are a lot
of crack heads down there.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.640
- Can you help me?

05:24.640 --> 05:25.640
- Who's your fiancé?

05:32.730 --> 05:33.733
Wait a second.

05:35.980 --> 05:36.980
Wait a second.

05:36.980 --> 05:39.610
Isn't that, that guy

05:39.610 --> 05:42.660
that was doing the pull-ups
on the side of the building?

05:42.660 --> 05:44.880
- Man! God!

05:44.880 --> 05:46.640
Man, that guy was stupid.
(sobbing)

05:46.640 --> 05:49.030
He was the stupidest guy in my life.

05:49.030 --> 05:50.989
See pictures of that?

05:50.989 --> 05:53.750
His brains was flooded all
over the goddamn sidewalk.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.000
It's horrible.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.550
It's like hit the ground.

05:56.550 --> 05:59.010
It's 150 feet like every direction.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.823
It's death and destruction blood.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.313
It's gonna power wash

06:03.313 --> 06:05.239
that guy's blood for like 72 hours.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.727
It's good as the street (indistinct).

06:07.660 --> 06:08.493
- Jack.

06:09.660 --> 06:10.750
- Sorry about that.

06:10.750 --> 06:12.263
I didn't mean anything by that.

06:14.220 --> 06:16.893
- So what makes you think he was murdered?

06:18.413 --> 06:19.930
- #SelfieKiller.

06:19.930 --> 06:21.430
- I don't understand show me.

06:21.430 --> 06:26.430
- Hashtag S-E-L-F-I-E-K-I-L-L-E-R.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.930
This is the last selfie,

06:31.930 --> 06:34.320
my fiancé took before he did the stunt.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.270
Look what he wrote.

06:37.511 --> 06:39.761
If you follow the hashtag,
you'll understand.

06:40.940 --> 06:42.510
- Hashtag?

06:42.510 --> 06:43.960
What the hell is the hashtag?

06:45.540 --> 06:47.640
- Hashtag is used on social media,

06:47.640 --> 06:49.703
like in your case, it'd be,

06:49.703 --> 06:51.990
"Hey it's Jack #Idiot."

06:53.812 --> 06:54.645
- Huh?

06:55.581 --> 06:56.414
- Exactly.

06:58.878 --> 07:01.378
(eerie music)

07:10.776 --> 07:14.026
(bright melodic music)

07:30.198 --> 07:32.865
(air whooshing)

07:44.345 --> 07:48.095
- You're lucky I was
right across the street.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.126
- This is for Lily, right?

07:51.126 --> 07:52.360
- Yes ma'am.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.760
- To the Cecil Hotel please.

07:55.360 --> 07:56.253
- You got it.

08:04.206 --> 08:07.289
(low brooding music)

08:11.101 --> 08:14.351
(upbeat melodic music)

08:37.799 --> 08:40.466
(air whooshing)

08:44.830 --> 08:46.480
- Jesus Max.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.060
To get that shirt and some seller,

08:48.060 --> 08:50.300
you wanna whomp whomp barn Tijuana?

08:50.300 --> 08:51.650
- My mom got me this shirt.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.633
- I like it.

09:00.864 --> 09:03.260
(sighs)

09:03.260 --> 09:06.440
- I think she was taking a selfie.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.940
- Hm mh.

09:08.940 --> 09:11.260
- He fell down into that dumpster.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.720
- You seriously want me to believe

09:13.720 --> 09:15.900
that she killed herself
while taking a selfie?

09:15.900 --> 09:17.640
- That's what happened.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.050
- Are you gonna tell Brooks that?

09:19.050 --> 09:21.373
- Yeah, I'll tell him.
- Good luck.

09:40.860 --> 09:41.860
- Oh my God!

09:44.530 --> 09:45.530
- I love it.

09:46.455 --> 09:47.288
Love it.

09:48.460 --> 09:49.900
- I guess, your taken.

09:49.900 --> 09:52.210
- Yeah. (chuckles)

09:52.210 --> 09:53.043
(horn beeps)

09:53.043 --> 09:55.500
- I do need first and last month

09:55.500 --> 09:58.183
plus $1,200 for deposit.

09:59.180 --> 10:00.013
- It's fine.

10:02.450 --> 10:04.240
- I like your hair.

10:04.240 --> 10:05.630
- Thanks.

10:05.630 --> 10:07.173
- Welcome to Los Angeles.

10:08.630 --> 10:09.463
- Thanks.

10:18.155 --> 10:22.822
(chuckles)
(horn beeps)

10:26.420 --> 10:29.820
- You're so lucky, you
got this place. (chuckles)

10:29.820 --> 10:31.080
- You scared me.

10:31.080 --> 10:31.913
- I'm sorry.

10:33.070 --> 10:35.700
I've never seen the inside of this.

10:35.700 --> 10:36.773
I'm so jealous.

10:37.620 --> 10:39.580
Wanna try the apartments?

10:39.580 --> 10:40.413
- Not a chance.

10:41.800 --> 10:42.800
- I don't blame you.

10:44.060 --> 10:44.893
- Wait.

10:46.590 --> 10:48.426
- I know you.

10:48.426 --> 10:49.259
(horn beeps)

10:49.259 --> 10:50.550
You're Kite girl.

10:50.550 --> 10:51.450
- That's me,

10:51.450 --> 10:54.460
I'm kiting with Kourtney. (laughs)

10:54.460 --> 10:55.730
- I still your videos.

10:55.730 --> 10:57.290
I follow you on IG.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.300
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:58.300 --> 10:59.250
- What's your name?

11:00.400 --> 11:01.417
- Megan Tastic.

11:02.283 --> 11:05.630
- Oh then you are cute.

11:05.630 --> 11:06.886
- When are you gonna follow me?

11:06.886 --> 11:08.770
(chuckles)

11:08.770 --> 11:10.200
- So how do you do it?

11:10.200 --> 11:11.950
How do you get all those followers?

11:13.160 --> 11:14.260
- Wanna take a selfie?

11:15.290 --> 11:17.640
- Yeah, let's do it.

11:17.640 --> 11:18.473
- We will.

11:19.326 --> 11:20.500
(camera shutters)

11:20.500 --> 11:24.443
Now, #killerselfie.

11:27.183 --> 11:28.070
There you go.

11:28.070 --> 11:29.580
- Oh, it's spot on.

11:29.580 --> 11:31.070
- Exactly.

11:31.070 --> 11:33.063
- Killer selfie with y instead if ie?

11:34.670 --> 11:35.980
- Really?

11:35.980 --> 11:38.620
If you want money and
fame from social media,

11:38.620 --> 11:40.083
you #Killerselfy.

11:41.010 --> 11:42.360
- That works?

11:42.360 --> 11:43.193
- Trust me.

11:44.062 --> 11:45.610
You've seen my posts, right?

11:45.610 --> 11:47.793
- I mean, yeah, I guess so.

11:48.630 --> 11:49.940
- I'll see you around.

11:49.940 --> 11:51.443
- Okay.

11:51.443 --> 11:52.276
Thanks.

11:57.534 --> 12:02.534
(door creaking)
(door thuds)

12:04.430 --> 12:05.814
- So the girl is coming, right?

12:05.814 --> 12:07.970
(hip hop music)

12:07.970 --> 12:09.420
He's still on that phone bro?

12:10.360 --> 12:14.240
- Look, first of all,
how to be a baller, 101.

12:15.232 --> 12:16.460
- All right.

12:16.460 --> 12:19.040
- So you've seen big brother, right?

12:19.040 --> 12:19.873
(chuckles)

12:19.873 --> 12:20.706
- Yeah, I've seen big brother.

12:20.706 --> 12:23.371
- You really show big
brother, 24/7 content.

12:23.371 --> 12:24.680
- 24/7 content.
- Right.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.960
- On the phone. (indistinct)
- On the phone.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.800
- Got it.
- Which in turn,

12:28.800 --> 12:30.880
driving our rep.
- Make that money.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.240
Make that money.
- Sounds good to me.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.230
- Rule number one,
- Ah!

12:35.230 --> 12:38.243
- Is that we should never ever
be out here doing that alone.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.140
You look like goddamn stockers.

12:41.140 --> 12:43.304
- Well, that's why I'm
with you, to be home.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.440
- Big brother.
- Well big bro.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.240
- Rule number two,
- Ah.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.790
- you can't just be pushing this car

12:47.790 --> 12:50.123
through anybody's hood like that.

12:50.123 --> 12:51.903
I think that goes without saying.

12:55.336 --> 12:56.792
- That's why you're with me.

12:56.792 --> 12:57.803
- Rule number three.
- Rule number three.

12:59.185 --> 13:00.450
- Hmm.
- Selfie, selfie, selfie.

13:00.450 --> 13:01.731
- Oh man, what's this?

13:01.731 --> 13:03.822
Have you gone crazy?
- Yeah, here we cool.

13:03.822 --> 13:06.660
(indistinct chatter)

13:06.660 --> 13:08.540
- I'm old enough for sleeves.

13:08.540 --> 13:09.760
How about that?

13:09.760 --> 13:11.257
Look.
- Okay dude.

13:11.257 --> 13:14.340
(indistinct chatter)

13:15.611 --> 13:17.154
- Well, popping in here.

13:17.154 --> 13:20.404
(police siren wailing)

13:22.175 --> 13:23.080
- Here.
- We don't get shot.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.630
- No, we rolled and we got to get paid.

13:24.630 --> 13:25.463
- What you doing here,

13:25.463 --> 13:26.440
we'll keep that rolling bro.
- We about to get paid.

13:26.440 --> 13:27.510
- You've taken like 10 seconds.

13:27.510 --> 13:28.773
Put the phone down.

13:29.909 --> 13:31.820
Are you serious?

13:31.820 --> 13:33.890
- Relax, relax, relax. We good.

13:34.880 --> 13:35.817
- Turn around.

13:37.840 --> 13:38.840
- Try and (mumbles)

13:38.840 --> 13:39.763
I'm sorry sir.

13:40.640 --> 13:41.683
Turn to Chrome bro.

13:44.940 --> 13:46.364
- Damn it.

13:46.364 --> 13:47.364
- About to get ours.

13:49.460 --> 13:50.710
- Good evening gentlemen.

13:53.750 --> 13:54.623
Nice night.

13:57.180 --> 13:59.260
Full moon.
(low brooding music)

13:59.260 --> 14:00.173
Nice car.

14:01.550 --> 14:02.493
Broken mirror.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.659
- That's just his car.

14:05.659 --> 14:07.826
(mumbles)

14:11.036 --> 14:13.786
- Chill out, relax mother fucker.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.663
- With 8 billion people on this earth.

14:19.160 --> 14:20.763
How many are watching you?

14:26.480 --> 14:29.230
(gunshot blasts)

14:32.530 --> 14:36.160
- Hey guys, it's me, Rosey.

14:36.160 --> 14:40.070
And today I am doing my
daily bit of humanitarianism.

14:40.070 --> 14:43.170
I am in DTLA and I'm about to go volunteer

14:43.170 --> 14:44.790
at a homeless shelter.

14:44.790 --> 14:47.080
You guys, I just wanna talk about

14:47.080 --> 14:49.910
like I love helping
people because honestly

14:49.910 --> 14:52.240
it's like the best thing
you could do for somebody.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.540
And I don't know about you guys,

14:53.540 --> 14:55.000
but like I sleep better at night

14:55.000 --> 14:57.800
knowing that like I'm changing the world

14:57.800 --> 14:59.943
like one homeless person at a time.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.500
Oh my God!

15:02.500 --> 15:05.060
Look, there's this
homeless guy right here.

15:05.060 --> 15:08.433
I mean, he looks so helpless.

15:09.324 --> 15:10.230
(sighs)

15:10.230 --> 15:12.936
But you know what would
make him feel better.

15:12.936 --> 15:15.450
A selfie with me. (chuckles)

15:15.450 --> 15:16.930
Okay.

15:16.930 --> 15:18.253
Let's get down here.

15:19.810 --> 15:22.750
One, two, three, philanthropy.

15:27.536 --> 15:30.036
One, two, three, philanthropy.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.183
(screams)

15:42.196 --> 15:45.196
(suspenseful music)

16:24.030 --> 16:29.030
- Do you always look
through people's windows?

16:29.741 --> 16:31.140
- I am so sorry.

16:31.140 --> 16:33.470
I was just trying to see if you're home.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.820
I brought the check that
you were asking about.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.440
- Thank you.

16:38.440 --> 16:42.083
Just, you could have used the mailbox.

16:45.470 --> 16:47.990
- Oh yeah. I'm sorry.

16:47.990 --> 16:49.710
I'm new to LA,

16:49.710 --> 16:51.260
so I wasn't sure how it worked.

16:53.320 --> 16:57.430
- I can only imagine how
difficult it would be

16:57.430 --> 16:58.823
to be on your own.

17:02.550 --> 17:03.383
- Yeah.

17:06.829 --> 17:11.280
So I was thinking that...
(gunshot blasts)

17:13.410 --> 17:14.242
Okay.

17:16.069 --> 17:16.903
Kramer.

17:38.262 --> 17:39.330
(air blasts)

17:39.330 --> 17:42.050
- Why does everyone of
those place out to creep me?

17:42.050 --> 17:42.883
- Hi.

17:44.290 --> 17:45.123
- Hi,

17:46.690 --> 17:47.523
I'm sorry.

17:47.523 --> 17:51.020
I'm Joe big, quick to scare.

17:51.020 --> 17:52.610
- Oh, it's all right.

17:52.610 --> 17:53.443
I'm Charlie.

17:54.690 --> 17:56.523
- Yeah. I know who you are.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.510
I've seen all your movies.

17:59.510 --> 18:00.700
- Thank you.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.000
I hope just the good ones.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.333
- I mean they're all good.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.320
Do you live here?

18:08.320 --> 18:09.153
I live here.

18:10.420 --> 18:12.000
- I own the building.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.943
I live uptown in the streets.

18:17.040 --> 18:17.873
- Wow!

18:18.900 --> 18:19.800
- Are you a model?

18:21.040 --> 18:22.053
- I used to, yeah.

18:23.574 --> 18:24.624
- You still could be.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.603
There's an app you should look into.

18:27.603 --> 18:29.720
It's called killer selfie.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.963
- Oh, you mean #KillerSelfie?

18:34.439 --> 18:37.533
- (indistinct) It's a hashtag
selfy killer with a y.

18:39.330 --> 18:42.840
- Well Kourtney, she
was telling me about it.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.393
She even spelled it out.

18:46.313 --> 18:47.907
I didn't know Kourtney could spell.

18:47.907 --> 18:49.213
(laughs)

18:49.213 --> 18:50.713
Have you ever talked with her.

18:51.980 --> 18:53.860
- I didn't mean to get her
in trouble or anything.

18:53.860 --> 18:55.003
- She got in trouble.

18:57.100 --> 18:58.750
Like seriously look into the app.

18:59.863 --> 19:02.113
Look like you can make
a lot of money, quick.

19:03.320 --> 19:04.170
Your very pretty.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.737
- Thank you.

19:06.737 --> 19:09.097
- You should get back into the modeling,

19:09.097 --> 19:11.503
and look at anything you were in.

19:11.503 --> 19:13.783
(chuckles)

19:13.783 --> 19:14.912
- Bye.

19:14.912 --> 19:15.745
- Bye.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.923
- Hey, you're not gonna believe
who I just ran into you.

19:33.012 --> 19:36.095
(soft melodic music)

19:37.239 --> 19:39.906
(air whooshing)

19:45.409 --> 19:48.018
(door thuds)
- Good evening.

19:48.018 --> 19:49.435
How are you, sir?

19:52.500 --> 19:53.333
So,

19:55.480 --> 19:56.780
- what are you doing here?

19:59.398 --> 20:00.548
- Can you give this to.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.060
- Where'd you find us?

20:12.345 --> 20:14.053
- It's the phone of the
girl who got murdered.

20:19.330 --> 20:20.630
- Hear that?

20:20.630 --> 20:21.480
- Yes Lieutenant.

20:24.100 --> 20:27.403
- So this is the phone of
the dead girl we brought in.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.150
I'm gonna need you to take
off those glasses sir.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.590
- Am I under arrest?

20:40.590 --> 20:43.453
- No. And the glass has never come off.

20:44.900 --> 20:47.150
All I did was bring her phone.

20:47.150 --> 20:48.993
- All I need is more information.

20:50.590 --> 20:52.090
- Get to work then, don't you?

20:53.410 --> 20:56.120
- Yeah, you know that's all we want.

20:56.120 --> 20:59.889
So we're asking you're not in
trouble and I don't like that.

20:59.889 --> 21:01.237
- Why don't you and I go in
the other room for a second.

21:01.237 --> 21:03.287
All right.
- Let me think about it, sir.

21:06.560 --> 21:07.703
- Hey Brooks.
- Yap.

21:09.471 --> 21:11.721
(coughing)

21:16.783 --> 21:19.466
- You're so disgusting.(laughs)

21:19.466 --> 21:21.181
- You're so disgusting.

21:21.181 --> 21:25.181
- Well, I'm thinking about
that one for a while.

21:26.109 --> 21:29.359
(upbeat melodic music)

21:56.360 --> 21:57.960
- So where'd you find the phone?

21:59.170 --> 22:00.370
- Look, man, I was sleeping,

22:00.370 --> 22:03.233
I woke up the phone was
on the ground, beside me.

22:05.620 --> 22:08.433
- So then you just decided to pick it up.

22:09.770 --> 22:11.450
- Yeah, I could sell it for food.

22:11.450 --> 22:13.830
- Yeah, food, right?

22:13.830 --> 22:18.803
Like those chips air or
maybe something like this?

22:22.790 --> 22:24.960
- Can you guys even do this?

22:24.960 --> 22:26.860
- We can do whatever the fuck we want.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.150
- Can I ask something?

22:33.150 --> 22:34.097
- Oh, you got some.

22:34.097 --> 22:36.010
- Yeah.
- There you go man.

22:36.010 --> 22:39.010
(suspenseful music)

22:46.920 --> 22:48.583
- Those are fucking assholes.

22:51.761 --> 22:53.844
(laughs)

22:57.040 --> 22:57.913
We're cops.

23:00.910 --> 23:03.440
Looking to make a deal with you, right?

23:03.440 --> 23:04.810
- You can have that 40.

23:04.810 --> 23:06.307
I got another 40 in bag.

23:06.307 --> 23:07.967
I've got more chips in the bag.

23:07.967 --> 23:10.440
All you gotta do is tell the truth

23:10.440 --> 23:11.273
and all that is yours.

23:11.273 --> 23:12.597
And you can walk out of here.

23:16.090 --> 23:17.143
- I like your style.

23:20.858 --> 23:23.858
(upbeat rock music)

23:52.287 --> 23:54.703
- Okay, time to try this up.

23:58.770 --> 24:03.513
Hey guys, it's my first
time on Killer Selfy.

24:05.690 --> 24:08.280
Well, my name is...
(door knocks)

24:08.280 --> 24:09.113
Come in.

24:10.030 --> 24:12.210
I saw you in Killer Selfy.

24:12.210 --> 24:13.230
- What?

24:13.230 --> 24:14.650
- I was on for a second,
(horn blares)

24:14.650 --> 24:16.480
like I literally just
signed up for the app.

24:16.480 --> 24:19.250
- It notifies us when
someone nearby goes live.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.040
I looked at it and it was you.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.170
- It's really creepy.

24:22.170 --> 24:23.200
- You won't get over it.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.798
- Okay, well I'm confused about like

24:24.798 --> 24:27.400
#Selfykiller, Killer Selfy.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.410
- Well Killer Selfy, the platform.

24:29.410 --> 24:30.437
- Okay.

24:30.437 --> 24:33.200
- And #killerselfy is the
way to make more money.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.680
They will reach out to eventually

24:34.680 --> 24:36.290
and make you an ambassador.

24:36.290 --> 24:37.920
- How long does that take?

24:37.920 --> 24:39.020
- Well, it's not going to take long.

24:39.020 --> 24:39.920
You're pretty hot.

24:41.654 --> 24:42.487
(phone vibrates)

24:42.487 --> 24:43.320
Hold on.

24:44.420 --> 24:45.253
- Hello.

24:46.580 --> 24:49.410
Oh hi, hold a second, it's my aunty.

24:49.410 --> 24:50.630
- Okay, I've got to go,

24:50.630 --> 24:52.120
but let me know if you
need help with the app.

24:52.120 --> 24:52.953
- Okay. Thanks.

24:53.790 --> 24:54.623
Hi aunty.

24:55.840 --> 24:57.410
Yeah.

24:57.410 --> 24:58.243
How are you?

25:00.070 --> 25:01.971
- Your mom wanted me to check up on you

25:01.971 --> 25:03.390
and see if you're okay.

25:03.390 --> 25:04.223
- Really?

25:04.223 --> 25:05.083
- Yeah. Are you okay?

25:06.400 --> 25:07.510
- Yeah. I'm okay.

25:07.510 --> 25:09.060
- What are you doing for money?

25:10.719 --> 25:12.570
- I just signed up for this app.

25:12.570 --> 25:14.280
- Killer Selfy?

25:14.280 --> 25:15.750
- You heard of it?

25:15.750 --> 25:16.583
(laughing)

25:16.583 --> 25:18.222
- Of course, I use it too.

25:18.222 --> 25:19.542
- Did you see me on there?

25:19.542 --> 25:20.625
- I sure did.

25:22.830 --> 25:25.310
- Well, I would love to
get together with you soon.

25:25.310 --> 25:26.910
Maybe we can have lunch one day.

25:28.100 --> 25:30.500
- Yeah, I'd love to let's do it.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.220
- How about next week sometime?

25:32.220 --> 25:33.880
- Next week works.

25:33.880 --> 25:34.840
Yeah.

25:34.840 --> 25:35.910
- Okay, bye.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.483
- Bye auntie.
- Bye.

25:40.220 --> 25:41.620
What the hell?

25:41.620 --> 25:43.270
Everyone watching me in this app.

25:45.787 --> 25:48.870
(low brooding music)

25:58.303 --> 26:00.420
- Looking good Haley.

26:00.420 --> 26:03.023
You're prompt, that's nice.

26:06.000 --> 26:06.833
- Nice tits,

26:08.627 --> 26:10.393
didn't know they were that big.

26:13.450 --> 26:14.600
I should have fuck you.

26:18.090 --> 26:21.543
God damn, you're stupid though, so stupid.

26:22.551 --> 26:24.062
- Hi everybody, it's your girl here on TV.

26:24.062 --> 26:26.211
- You just wanna be on TV, don't you?

26:26.211 --> 26:27.443
It's all you think about.

26:27.443 --> 26:28.543
Just wanna get famous.

26:29.802 --> 26:31.020
You just wanna be famous.

26:31.020 --> 26:32.100
- Don't you wish that

26:32.100 --> 26:34.750
you could have the same enjoyment
as a dog going on a walk.

26:34.750 --> 26:39.323
- That's not gonna happen
for you or anyone like you.

26:40.511 --> 26:42.637
- Hey everyone, it's your girl Haley,

26:42.637 --> 26:43.488
from Killer Selfy.

26:43.488 --> 26:45.558
(indistinct)

26:45.558 --> 26:46.558
- Time's up.

26:51.936 --> 26:54.750
(screams)

26:54.750 --> 26:57.000
- What happened to the dog?

27:00.658 --> 27:03.408
(motor rattling)

27:06.077 --> 27:06.910
- Come in.

27:11.661 --> 27:13.020
- Girl, you didn't even ask who it is

27:13.020 --> 27:14.170
before you let someone in.

27:14.170 --> 27:16.100
- I had a feeling it was you.

27:16.100 --> 27:17.070
- Aah! I see.

27:17.070 --> 27:18.277
- Already append.

27:19.740 --> 27:21.180
- Oh, what's it you making?

27:21.180 --> 27:22.260
- Smoothie.

27:22.260 --> 27:24.687
- I love smoothie. Can I try?

27:25.683 --> 27:28.600
- Did you see that girl
got hit by car, on the app?

27:28.600 --> 27:29.600
- What?

27:29.600 --> 27:30.940
Really?

27:30.940 --> 27:32.460
No.

27:32.460 --> 27:33.810
- Check out the last video.

27:36.400 --> 27:39.261
- Oh, I should have warned you.

27:39.261 --> 27:41.010
- You could have the same enjoyment

27:41.010 --> 27:42.350
as a dog going on a walk.

27:42.350 --> 27:44.600
- What does that even mean?

27:45.812 --> 27:48.310
(tires squealing)
- (screams) Oh my...

27:50.400 --> 27:51.260
Is this real?

27:51.260 --> 27:52.259
- It's all real.

27:52.259 --> 27:53.657
- (indistinct) You could
have the same enjoyment

27:53.657 --> 27:55.272
as a dog going on a walk.
- It happened?

27:55.272 --> 27:57.600
- I think she just wasn't
looking when she was on life.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.433
(screams)

27:58.433 --> 28:00.220
She'd just cross the streets

28:00.220 --> 28:02.070
without checking he cars were coming.

28:03.520 --> 28:05.070
- That's bad.

28:05.070 --> 28:06.593
- Stupid, if you tell me.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.020
- Yeah, exactly.

28:10.020 --> 28:13.023
- Hey, have you gone on live again?

28:14.360 --> 28:17.242
- No, not since you showed
up last time I used it.

28:17.242 --> 28:18.075
(horn blares)

28:18.075 --> 28:19.250
I hope I didn't scare you.

28:19.250 --> 28:22.570
- No, you just kind blew
my mind a little more.

28:22.570 --> 28:23.573
- Hell no.

28:29.600 --> 28:31.460
- Welcome to kiting and with Kourtney.

28:31.460 --> 28:34.433
It's a beautiful day and I'm
here today with my new kite.

28:35.370 --> 28:38.047
Kite, can you take it from here?

28:39.160 --> 28:40.303
- Isn't it beautiful?

28:41.150 --> 28:42.470
I love it.

28:42.470 --> 28:46.310
I also got some new
sexy things. (chuckles)

28:46.310 --> 28:48.110
Thank you Killer Selfy.

28:49.810 --> 28:51.440
Shouldn't have done that.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.777
Are you ready to see me fly this kite?

28:56.361 --> 28:58.377
- Look at it fly.

28:58.377 --> 28:59.210
Hu-hu!

29:00.334 --> 29:01.916
(low brooding music)

29:01.916 --> 29:04.420
Woo! (laughs)

29:04.420 --> 29:05.783
Isn't it beautiful?

29:06.700 --> 29:08.240
What I love about kites?

29:08.240 --> 29:10.560
When they're out there in the sky,

29:10.560 --> 29:14.075
they're free to blow in
the wind, just like me.

29:14.075 --> 29:17.230
(laughs joyfully)

29:17.230 --> 29:18.383
- Can I help you?

29:23.460 --> 29:25.610
- What's going on man.

29:25.610 --> 29:27.120
- My main man Jack.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.110
- Mr. Detective.

29:29.110 --> 29:30.220
Don't worry man, we're gonna get you.

29:30.220 --> 29:32.873
- You shot shot that crappy
tequila and a water bag.

29:34.692 --> 29:35.932
Just don't wanna give up.

29:35.932 --> 29:37.429
- Tequila?

29:37.429 --> 29:40.429
(upbeat rock music)

29:42.570 --> 29:45.570
- What are you working on
at the moment, the case?

29:45.570 --> 29:47.820
- Nah, it's just about
this Killer Selfy app.

29:49.450 --> 29:52.280
- I see him on that
crap in here sometimes.

29:52.280 --> 29:53.780
- No shit.

29:53.780 --> 29:54.860
- That sounds like a load of trouble.

29:54.860 --> 29:55.693
If he tells me I mean,

29:55.693 --> 29:58.580
would you wanna network
for in your every move?

29:58.580 --> 30:01.373
- I don't know, could make you famous.

30:02.854 --> 30:04.881
- Yeah, that's kind of
famous look at you now.

30:04.881 --> 30:05.714
- Yeah.

30:14.040 --> 30:17.136
- That's the Chinese girl
that talked to Brooks.

30:17.136 --> 30:18.636
- Let me see that.

30:21.554 --> 30:23.456
- Oh yeah, he's all right?
- Yeah.

30:23.456 --> 30:24.780
- That's the girl for
the innovative video,

30:24.780 --> 30:26.187
last week, isn't it?

30:26.187 --> 30:28.073
- I don't believe this man.

30:30.210 --> 30:32.020
- Maybe you could win a bit on the booze,

30:32.020 --> 30:35.640
you might see a bit more clearly man.

30:35.640 --> 30:36.810
- Tomorrow.

30:36.810 --> 30:38.260
- Yeah, tomorrow never knows.

30:41.560 --> 30:42.810
- Lemme get you one more.

30:45.100 --> 30:45.933
All for you.

30:47.060 --> 30:48.002
- Thanks man.

30:48.002 --> 30:49.419
- It's all right.

30:51.060 --> 30:52.283
Hey Brooks,

30:53.550 --> 30:56.193
have you seen any other
videos from this app?

30:57.320 --> 30:58.873
Well, you should.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.890
- Okay.
- All right.

31:02.890 --> 31:04.170
I'll see ya.

31:04.170 --> 31:05.003
- All right.

31:08.294 --> 31:09.360
- Have a good night Max.
- You too bro.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.137
See you soon.
- All right.

31:19.272 --> 31:21.140
Thanks max.

31:21.140 --> 31:21.973
- Your badge.

31:25.690 --> 31:28.110
- When you get your license back,

31:28.110 --> 31:30.400
you're driving for a year straight.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.233
- Fine.

31:32.580 --> 31:35.150
- Still can't believe you got a DUI.

31:35.150 --> 31:36.780
(sighs)

31:36.780 --> 31:39.073
- Me neither. (laughs)

31:40.560 --> 31:43.060
(eerie music)

31:47.230 --> 31:48.880
- How's it going Jack?

31:48.880 --> 31:49.713
- Lieutenant.

31:52.281 --> 31:53.114
- Another phone.

31:54.100 --> 31:55.513
- Not just another phone.

31:56.490 --> 31:58.580
This phone and the last phone,

31:58.580 --> 31:59.830
have something in common.

32:00.730 --> 32:01.563
- All right.

32:08.210 --> 32:09.043
Is it good?

32:10.300 --> 32:11.483
- Put less sugar in it.

32:14.440 --> 32:16.150
They were both filmed live

32:16.150 --> 32:21.150
on an app called, get this, Killer Selfy,

32:21.730 --> 32:23.303
at the time of their deaths.

32:25.070 --> 32:25.903
- What!

32:26.837 --> 32:30.850
bagged that girl yesterday

32:30.850 --> 32:32.840
just got hit by car.

32:32.840 --> 32:35.023
- Did she?
- Yeah. Yeah.

32:37.460 --> 32:38.750
Read this.

32:38.750 --> 32:39.850
- I'll read it.

32:39.850 --> 32:41.490
- Really read it.

32:41.490 --> 32:42.323
- I'll read it.

32:43.990 --> 32:44.870
I'll read it.

32:44.870 --> 32:46.440
I promise, I'll read it.

32:46.440 --> 32:48.570
I read it tonight, okay, I promise.

32:48.570 --> 32:50.943
I'll read it tonight, I promise.

32:52.760 --> 32:54.960
- It's still streaming
videos on their site.

32:55.970 --> 32:58.033
Watch both videos you'll see what I mean.

32:59.220 --> 33:00.120
- I'll watch them.

33:03.795 --> 33:04.980
- You're are dismissed.

33:04.980 --> 33:05.813
- All right.

33:05.813 --> 33:08.950
- Take my copy and read it.

33:08.950 --> 33:09.783
- Yes sir.

33:16.614 --> 33:19.364
(phone vibrates)

33:21.940 --> 33:22.773
- What?

33:24.100 --> 33:25.483
- Anyway, listen.

33:28.610 --> 33:29.443
- What?

33:30.320 --> 33:34.050
- Listen, what do you want me to do?

33:34.050 --> 33:35.350
- You have a plane ticket,

33:36.330 --> 33:37.523
you know what to do?

33:39.330 --> 33:41.083
- Do I need an ID?

33:43.540 --> 33:45.570
- Do you need ID?

33:45.570 --> 33:46.573
It's an airport.

33:47.620 --> 33:48.640
Of course you need ID.

33:48.640 --> 33:50.310
You have a plane ticket.

33:50.310 --> 33:51.343
You know what to do.

33:53.140 --> 33:54.740
You get on the plane and you go.

33:56.360 --> 33:58.290
- That's fine.

33:58.290 --> 33:59.123
- Say it.

34:00.800 --> 34:05.800
- Airport ID, plane ticket and
just get on a plane and go.

34:07.490 --> 34:08.989
- Because you have the ticket.

34:10.480 --> 34:11.543
- Yeah, that's fine.

34:13.540 --> 34:14.373
- Good.

34:16.862 --> 34:18.080
(sighs)

34:18.080 --> 34:18.993
- Fucking idiot.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.112
- All right.

34:23.040 --> 34:25.679
I've been following this app for a while.

34:25.679 --> 34:28.243
- Yeah, tell me something new Jack.

34:29.699 --> 34:31.889
- I'm trying to find out who owns it

34:31.889 --> 34:35.402
because it's local, but
I get stopped every time.

34:37.980 --> 34:39.560
- Who stops you?

34:39.560 --> 34:41.409
- It's more like who doesn't stop me.

34:42.400 --> 34:43.989
- Okay. Wait, what do you mean?

34:43.989 --> 34:45.652
- Every time I get close,

34:48.020 --> 34:49.159
someone higher ups,

34:49.159 --> 34:49.993
shut it down.

34:53.487 --> 34:55.570
- You know, I saw Lily on there tonight.

34:56.620 --> 34:58.620
- Did you watch the video of her fiancé?

35:00.170 --> 35:01.003
Watch it.

35:02.420 --> 35:04.300
- It's that you.

35:04.300 --> 35:06.950
- Why the hell do you think
I'm telling you all this?

35:08.420 --> 35:10.100
- Because we're cops Jack.

35:10.100 --> 35:13.363
- No, it's because
you're Lieutenant Brooks,

35:14.530 --> 35:15.363
a legend.

35:17.730 --> 35:19.383
- You really put the eye in it.

35:23.635 --> 35:26.030
- Are you gonna watch these videos?

35:26.030 --> 35:26.863
- I will.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.933
You know, he lives in LA.

35:32.190 --> 35:33.193
- You mean lived?

35:35.850 --> 35:40.100
- Look, why don't you
take, you and dumb ass

35:40.100 --> 35:42.733
and go to his last place of residency.

35:44.180 --> 35:45.953
- I'll take care of it in the morning.

35:50.886 --> 35:52.553
- I get an IQ of 12.

35:53.835 --> 35:54.668
(low brooding music)

35:54.668 --> 35:55.501
- All right sir, I know
you've seen the videos

35:55.501 --> 35:57.190
of this guy doing the pull-ups, right?

35:57.190 --> 35:58.975
- Yeah, I watched it last
night with your mother.

35:58.975 --> 36:01.490
(laughs)

36:01.490 --> 36:03.800
- Can you do me a favor and
get Brooks to look at him?

36:03.800 --> 36:06.727
Cause he has looked at
any video I've sent.

36:06.727 --> 36:08.250
I don't know, I can he email
it to him or something,

36:08.250 --> 36:10.553
or maybe I don't know, put a star on it.

36:16.600 --> 36:17.973
- So you don't know Paul.

36:18.820 --> 36:20.370
- Who's Paul?

36:20.370 --> 36:21.823
- He lived here before.

36:22.860 --> 36:24.150
- Is he okay?

36:24.150 --> 36:25.803
- No, he's dead.

36:29.110 --> 36:31.310
- Makes sense, why I
moved in here so quick.

36:33.980 --> 36:35.547
- Did he leave anything behind?

36:37.577 --> 36:39.973
- Well I guess, all of this,

36:41.150 --> 36:43.600
it must be his cause it
was here when I moved in.

36:44.750 --> 36:46.320
- When did you move in?

36:46.320 --> 36:47.770
- Just a couple of weeks ago.

36:49.621 --> 36:50.454
- That's good.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.580
- Excuse me. What are you doing?

36:53.580 --> 36:54.977
- I'm just looking.

36:54.977 --> 36:56.600
- Don't you need a warrant?

36:56.600 --> 36:59.200
- Not unless we think you
did something wrong, okay?

37:04.290 --> 37:05.530
- All right, is there anyone else

37:05.530 --> 37:07.143
who knows anything about Paul?

37:10.120 --> 37:11.440
- Maybe Roy.

37:11.440 --> 37:12.690
- Roy?

37:12.690 --> 37:15.000
I think there's a guy
who passed in the way in.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.470
- Yeah, he was leaving,
I was talking to him

37:16.470 --> 37:18.290
about fixing something for the apartment

37:18.290 --> 37:20.540
but he said I had to
wait until they get back.

37:20.540 --> 37:21.910
- So he's gone.

37:21.910 --> 37:23.500
- I guess so.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.072
- Wow!

37:25.072 --> 37:27.200
(horn blares)
(laughs)

37:27.200 --> 37:28.363
That's just perfect.

37:29.530 --> 37:30.663
- I mean you can leave him a note.

37:35.600 --> 37:36.620
- No, I don't wanna leave a note,

37:36.620 --> 37:37.964
but thank you for your time.

37:37.964 --> 37:39.556
- Sure. Glad if I help.

37:39.556 --> 37:40.806
- Okay. Thanks.

37:46.817 --> 37:49.984
(bright upbeat music)

37:57.450 --> 37:59.100
- Hey.

37:59.100 --> 37:59.933
- Hey.

38:01.650 --> 38:03.350
- I'm still taking a selfie. Are you in?

38:03.350 --> 38:04.776
- Yes.

38:04.776 --> 38:07.643
(gentle rock music)

38:07.643 --> 38:09.810
- Well auntie, (laughs)

38:09.810 --> 38:11.630
what is your secrets?

38:11.630 --> 38:13.110
- You are so sweet.

38:13.110 --> 38:14.860
You definitely take after your mom.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.030
- Oh, I'm sending this to her.

38:16.030 --> 38:17.603
She's gonna love it.

38:17.603 --> 38:18.436
- Honey.

38:19.661 --> 38:20.494
- Yes, okay.

38:20.494 --> 38:21.660
- What are you waiting on?

38:21.660 --> 38:23.263
- No, I just got here.

38:24.322 --> 38:26.780
(indistinct)

38:26.780 --> 38:30.420
- So have you made any
money yet, but modeling?

38:30.420 --> 38:31.653
- No with that app?

38:32.810 --> 38:35.460
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

38:35.460 --> 38:39.010
I've seen a lot of people
around here make a lot of money.

38:39.010 --> 38:41.413
Just make sure you #selfykiller.

38:42.850 --> 38:45.363
- Why? You didn't think your arm was hit.

38:47.800 --> 38:48.807
You've used it.

38:48.807 --> 38:51.200
- Yeah, I've used it a few times.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.033
- Get out.

38:52.033 --> 38:54.440
- What? I can't be cool.

38:54.440 --> 38:56.500
- No, you're of course super cool

38:56.500 --> 38:59.006
and hip antsy.

38:59.006 --> 39:02.550
(sighs)
- Of course.

39:02.550 --> 39:03.383
- So,

39:05.449 --> 39:07.000
just do once.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.010
- That's it?

39:08.010 --> 39:12.010
- Yeah. And I don't make any money, so -

39:12.010 --> 39:13.018
- What?

39:13.018 --> 39:14.758
You have to use it three times.

39:14.758 --> 39:16.120
- Okay.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.760
- Then you'll get an ambassador email.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.810
- Oh okay so that makes more sense

39:20.810 --> 39:23.290
because the girl in my
building just want me to use it

39:23.290 --> 39:27.390
and that I make extra cash
and I didn't know, so.

39:27.390 --> 39:29.490
- Why don't you start recording right now?

39:30.860 --> 39:31.693
- Right now?

39:31.693 --> 39:34.460
- Yeah, that way you only
have to use it one more time

39:34.460 --> 39:35.960
before you start getting paid.

39:38.175 --> 39:39.133
- I love you auntie.

39:39.133 --> 39:40.384
I love you too, niece.

39:40.384 --> 39:41.845
- Okay, are you ready?

39:41.845 --> 39:42.678
- Hmm.

39:45.370 --> 39:48.720
♪ It's out to take break to
get the trail (indistinct) ♪

39:48.720 --> 39:49.553
- Hey everyone.

39:49.553 --> 39:51.220
It's Megan Tastic.

39:51.220 --> 39:53.023
I am here with my auntie.

39:56.330 --> 39:57.782
- Charlie.

39:57.782 --> 39:59.400
- Hi.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.616
When did you two know each other.

40:01.616 --> 40:02.973
- That's my auntie.

40:04.616 --> 40:06.120
- You mind if I seat down?

40:06.120 --> 40:09.823
- Oh yeah, when you're
already sitting, but sure.

40:11.116 --> 40:12.730
- What are you guys do?

40:12.730 --> 40:15.123
- Well, Megan was just recording live.

40:16.410 --> 40:17.433
- On Killer Selfy?

40:18.560 --> 40:19.393
- Yeah.

40:20.372 --> 40:21.893
- It's your second time, right?

40:23.840 --> 40:24.723
- Yeah, it is.

40:26.520 --> 40:27.620
How did you know that?

40:28.527 --> 40:29.593
- I'm on the app?

40:31.236 --> 40:32.069
I just like to know what's going on

40:32.069 --> 40:33.610
and I like a little extra money.

40:33.610 --> 40:36.060
So, that sound good for me.

40:36.060 --> 40:37.630
Well, don't worry about her Charlie.

40:37.630 --> 40:40.360
She's still getting used
to the LA lifestyle.

40:40.360 --> 40:44.570
- No way, everybody makes
money but nobody has a job

40:44.570 --> 40:47.490
and just keep sucking on mommy's titty

40:47.490 --> 40:48.810
waiting for those checks.

40:48.810 --> 40:49.643
- Pretty much.

40:51.060 --> 40:52.360
- Are you still recording?

40:55.330 --> 40:56.710
- Yeah I am.

40:56.710 --> 40:57.793
- Record us all.

40:58.960 --> 41:01.203
Oh.

41:02.830 --> 41:03.663
Okay.

41:06.300 --> 41:09.589
Me again with my auntie and -

41:09.589 --> 41:10.820

41:10.820 --> 41:11.890
Good to see everybody.

41:11.890 --> 41:13.370
Keep watching my movies.

41:13.370 --> 41:16.320
Mustache here is strong,
green eyes, long eyelashes,

41:16.320 --> 41:18.080
can't argue with that.

41:18.080 --> 41:19.801
Hold it up just (indistinct)

41:19.801 --> 41:21.450

41:21.450 --> 41:22.793
Thank you, soft chin.

(screaming)

44:15.594 --> 44:17.172
- No,

44:17.172 --> 44:18.005
no.

44:25.058 --> 44:26.458
- Yeah, it was just a video.

44:36.566 --> 44:39.649
(low brooding music)

44:41.180 --> 44:43.190
- This gives new meaning to break a leg.

44:43.190 --> 44:44.450
(laughs)

44:44.450 --> 44:45.865
- It's not funny Dick.

44:45.865 --> 44:46.698
- Oh my God!

44:46.698 --> 44:47.930
You guys are messed up.

44:47.930 --> 44:49.040
- Like we'll be back in a few

44:49.040 --> 44:50.520
and I'll give your sponge back, okay?

44:50.520 --> 44:51.460
- Thank you.

44:51.460 --> 44:55.450
But nurse, when you're
done, I could use one too.

44:55.450 --> 44:56.550
- Why aren't you cute?

44:59.350 --> 45:00.323
- Damn straight.

45:02.960 --> 45:04.100
- Are you okay?

45:04.100 --> 45:06.023
Oh man, don't throw up on me man.

45:07.190 --> 45:08.930
It's bad enough, I just lost my leg.

45:08.930 --> 45:11.250
Now this asshole is gonna throw up on me.

45:11.250 --> 45:12.670
I swear, I'll Sue.

45:12.670 --> 45:13.503
- I'm fine.

45:13.503 --> 45:15.460
I just gotta use the bathroom.
- All right.

45:16.340 --> 45:18.720
- Can use the one down the hall please.

45:18.720 --> 45:19.630
- This is good.

45:21.700 --> 45:23.853
- So, what happened?

45:25.160 --> 45:26.553
SAS performing.

45:28.330 --> 45:30.183
Oh man, that's disgusting.
- Sorry.

45:32.940 --> 45:34.610
- Don't worry about him.

45:34.610 --> 45:35.710
Tell me what happened.

45:38.040 --> 45:40.150
- I was performing at the show

45:40.150 --> 45:43.090
and next thing I know,
I'm lying on the ground,

45:43.090 --> 45:44.433
and my leg cut off.

45:47.740 --> 45:49.040
- That's all you remember?

45:50.750 --> 45:51.583
- Yeah.

45:51.583 --> 45:53.180
- You don't remember anything else?

45:53.180 --> 45:54.403
That's all you got.

45:55.682 --> 45:57.520
(sighs)

45:57.520 --> 45:59.643
Were you doing anything different?

46:03.460 --> 46:04.970
- I was filming for this app

46:04.970 --> 46:06.300
called Killer Selfy.

46:06.300 --> 46:07.133
- Killer Selfy?

46:08.180 --> 46:09.970
The app that pays you?

46:09.970 --> 46:11.320
- That's the one.

46:11.320 --> 46:12.520
- Okay.

46:12.520 --> 46:14.220
Did they know you were performing?

46:15.060 --> 46:17.640
- Yeah, they, they helped
me prearrange the show.

46:17.640 --> 46:20.240
- All right? That's interesting.

46:20.240 --> 46:21.580
- Why?

46:21.580 --> 46:23.320
- No reason.
(sighs)

46:23.320 --> 46:24.600
- Wow!

46:24.600 --> 46:26.680
- Man, can you shut the door please?

46:26.680 --> 46:28.180
- You can go shut it yourself.

46:32.033 --> 46:33.590
- Man, I only have one leg.

46:33.590 --> 46:35.280
- I see you got another one right there.

46:35.280 --> 46:36.113
- Asshole.

46:36.113 --> 46:38.793
- Hey, consider this motivation.

46:40.530 --> 46:43.920
- Oh, it's disgusting.

46:43.920 --> 46:47.778
(indistinct chatter)

46:47.778 --> 46:50.861
(low brooding music)

46:56.840 --> 46:59.583
- All my people on
Killer Selfy, what's up?

46:59.583 --> 47:01.203
It's going down.

47:02.570 --> 47:05.830
Yeah, I mean it was mostly,
you know, I had an accident

47:05.830 --> 47:06.793
on my last show.

47:08.352 --> 47:10.002
I had my leg cut off by
some fool in the audience.

47:10.002 --> 47:12.485
(low brooding music)

47:12.485 --> 47:14.485
(sighs)

47:16.620 --> 47:17.887
- You hear from my (indistinct).

47:20.338 --> 47:22.838
(eerie music)

47:28.723 --> 47:31.556
(breaths heavily)

48:06.270 --> 48:07.420
- Brooks.

48:07.420 --> 48:08.253
- Jack.

48:09.120 --> 48:10.250
- You have to see this.

48:10.250 --> 48:11.793
- Did you see this?

48:12.930 --> 48:14.450
- Yeah, I saw that a few days ago.

48:14.450 --> 48:16.310
- Why didn't you tell me?

48:16.310 --> 48:18.550
- I had to check some things out first.

48:18.550 --> 48:20.900
- All right. What'd you find out?

48:20.900 --> 48:22.980
- Besides you're ugly. (laughs)

48:22.980 --> 48:24.540
- Can you be serious for a second?

48:24.540 --> 48:29.140
- Old, pants are too baggy. (laughs)

48:29.140 --> 48:29.973
- Yeah.

48:29.973 --> 48:32.460
- All right, Max and I got
to check out this video,

48:32.460 --> 48:33.860
wants you to watch it after.

48:35.066 --> 48:36.740
All right.

48:36.740 --> 48:38.160
Lieutenant.

48:38.160 --> 48:41.653
- You might wanna switch
the (mumbles) there, Jack.

48:49.420 --> 48:52.923
- Okay, three, two, one.

48:54.344 --> 48:56.860
(door bell rings)

48:56.860 --> 48:57.963
Right on schedule.

48:59.370 --> 49:00.203
- Hey Corey.

49:03.424 --> 49:04.860
What happened to you?

49:04.860 --> 49:06.160
- I had a little accident.

49:07.670 --> 49:08.920
- Corey, let me see that.

49:11.282 --> 49:12.115
It's not little.

49:15.861 --> 49:16.770
You want me to stop recording?

49:16.770 --> 49:18.221
Please?

49:18.221 --> 49:20.290
(door knock)

49:20.290 --> 49:21.123
- Come in.

49:23.930 --> 49:26.980
(low brooding music)

49:26.980 --> 49:28.543
- And here you are.

49:29.840 --> 49:31.140
I've been looking for you.

49:32.530 --> 49:33.683
We need to talk.

49:36.970 --> 49:38.320
- Is it about me recording?

49:42.240 --> 49:43.813
- No, it's not.

49:45.890 --> 49:49.803
It's a personal matter of
about last month's rent check.

49:56.708 --> 49:58.880
- I'll get right back.

49:58.880 --> 50:00.480
- Shall I go with you?
- Megan.

50:01.660 --> 50:02.960
- That won't be necessary.

50:12.296 --> 50:13.213
- I'm okay.

50:17.570 --> 50:22.113
- I think it's best that
you just stay out of this.

50:23.820 --> 50:24.653
Come on.

50:40.620 --> 50:42.823
- I wonder for accidents on Killer Selfy.

51:02.580 --> 51:04.050
- Was that the guy?

51:04.050 --> 51:05.123
- I checked this out.

51:08.860 --> 51:10.190
- Press play.

51:10.190 --> 51:11.140
- Yes sir.

51:11.140 --> 51:12.700
- When they're out there in the sky...

51:12.700 --> 51:14.110
- Is that working?
- It's good.

51:14.110 --> 51:16.050
- Blowing in the wind. Just like me.

51:16.958 --> 51:20.970
(shouts joyfully)
- Watch.

51:20.970 --> 51:21.803
- Oh shit!

51:22.670 --> 51:24.470
Is that the guy who dropped off the phone?

51:24.470 --> 51:25.670
- We had him right here.

51:25.670 --> 51:27.430
- And we let him get away?
(gentle music)

51:27.430 --> 51:28.940
- No, all this stuff,

51:28.940 --> 51:31.710
happened after he brought in the phone.

51:31.710 --> 51:32.543
- Get out of here.

51:32.543 --> 51:33.376
- Look.

51:34.600 --> 51:36.270
- Do you know where to get him?

51:36.270 --> 51:38.784
- Most likely.
- Let's go get his ass.

51:38.784 --> 51:39.617
All right.

51:45.880 --> 51:47.880
- It's impossible, he's the only killer.

51:49.500 --> 51:50.333
- He could be.

51:53.311 --> 51:55.025
- Do you really think so?

51:55.025 --> 51:55.950
- But right now,

51:55.950 --> 51:58.273
he's the only one we
can link to the crimes.

52:00.020 --> 52:02.683
- Are we gonna get back up at this time?

52:02.683 --> 52:04.300
- I don't think that's a good idea.

52:04.300 --> 52:05.930
- Why not?

52:05.930 --> 52:07.220
- Let's catch him on Killer Selfy.

52:07.220 --> 52:08.060
- But that's not protocol.

52:08.060 --> 52:09.460
- Go to hell with that shit.

52:10.380 --> 52:12.020
- What about Brooks?
- What about Brooks?

52:12.020 --> 52:13.480
I will take any hint.

52:14.622 --> 52:16.720
- I don't think it's a good idea.

52:16.720 --> 52:18.870
- We have to man.
- No, we don't.

52:18.870 --> 52:20.680
- Come on.
- No.

52:20.680 --> 52:21.680
- Come on.
- Nope.

52:21.680 --> 52:23.380
Come on.
- Nope.

52:23.380 --> 52:27.900
- Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on,

52:27.900 --> 52:30.230
come on.
- Fine.

52:30.230 --> 52:31.063
- Yes.

52:35.353 --> 52:38.436
(low brooding music)

52:40.840 --> 52:43.730
- You're not even going
to get out of the car.

52:43.730 --> 52:44.970
- I don't think this is a good idea

52:44.970 --> 52:47.370
we're out here all alone with no backup.

52:47.370 --> 52:49.500
- Well, he's getting
out of the goddamn car.

52:49.500 --> 52:52.340
I'll walk over there and
arrest that son of a bitch.

52:52.340 --> 52:53.173
- Fine.

53:00.090 --> 53:01.173
- Are you happy now?

53:03.820 --> 53:04.813
- Action baby.

53:13.820 --> 53:15.363
How's this work, are we on?

53:20.850 --> 53:21.683
We're live.

53:23.650 --> 53:25.293
Hey everybody,

53:26.160 --> 53:30.593
this is detective Jack
McDaniels and detective Max.

53:32.290 --> 53:34.433
Sorry, my partner was left anonymous.

53:35.794 --> 53:36.627
(eerie music)

53:36.627 --> 53:38.870
I'm about to arrest a selfy killer.

53:38.870 --> 53:39.853
Yes, that's right.

53:41.650 --> 53:42.850
This could be dangerous.

53:44.326 --> 53:46.103
I do ready to shoot at all times.

53:47.650 --> 53:50.010
This is that piece of shit,

53:50.010 --> 53:52.033
who's responsible for all those deaths.

53:55.340 --> 53:56.683
Little does he know,

53:57.600 --> 53:58.963
it all ends today.

54:10.360 --> 54:11.193
Stop.

54:12.240 --> 54:13.460
I'll shoot.

54:13.460 --> 54:15.210
- Still recording.

54:15.210 --> 54:17.013
I'm going to kill two pigs tonight.

54:19.760 --> 54:20.810
This is gonna be fun.

54:25.176 --> 54:27.926
(gunshot blasts)

54:34.914 --> 54:36.400
- Hey man,

54:36.400 --> 54:40.560
just get a Grey Goose,
(rock music)

54:40.560 --> 54:42.323
just to straight up, is fine.

54:49.580 --> 54:50.413
Hey mommy?

54:51.800 --> 54:54.426
Yeah just, we'll fly out of van

54:54.426 --> 54:55.787
(indistinct) and just
go in and deal with it

54:55.787 --> 54:57.204
when we get that.

54:58.445 --> 55:00.980
(indistinct) sandwich, I just need a plane

55:00.980 --> 55:02.923
to cash it up, we're leaving.

55:03.794 --> 55:05.044
We leave in 20.

55:10.172 --> 55:11.339
- That's cool.

55:13.188 --> 55:15.605
(indistinct)

55:16.808 --> 55:18.884
- You're making noise.

55:18.884 --> 55:19.735
- Thanks man.

55:19.735 --> 55:20.568
That's a good one.

55:20.568 --> 55:23.373
That's a good one but I don't like it.

55:23.373 --> 55:24.991
- There was one-

55:24.991 --> 55:29.933
There was a, there was a big scene,

55:29.933 --> 55:31.270
I think in the desert

55:31.270 --> 55:33.140
and there was a, there was a helicopter

55:33.140 --> 55:34.841
and then you were on a horse.

55:34.841 --> 55:35.674
- The olden.

55:35.674 --> 55:38.380
- The olden, and that's it
the old (indistinct) on DVD.

55:38.380 --> 55:39.549
- Oh dude. Thank you.

55:39.549 --> 55:40.382
- Yeah.

55:40.382 --> 55:41.340
- (indistinct) buy in the street for me.

55:41.340 --> 55:42.600
- Yeah, pretty much.

55:42.600 --> 55:45.882
- I kept that horse bucked me off once so.

55:45.882 --> 55:47.820
(indistinct)
- Yeah.

55:47.820 --> 55:49.893
- I got rid of him
right after he did that.

55:52.804 --> 55:54.554
- That's close to it.

55:57.209 --> 55:59.391
(indistinct)

55:59.391 --> 56:01.224
- Yes sir.
- Thank you.

56:02.911 --> 56:05.170
- I was doing my

56:06.480 --> 56:07.870
duty for my country.

56:07.870 --> 56:08.870
- Yeah, I'm a pussy.

56:10.180 --> 56:13.183
I thought about it once
more, the whole idea of it.

56:14.760 --> 56:17.043
- Yeah, it's fine, there's
nothing brave about war.

56:18.390 --> 56:20.668
- Yeah. It seems scary man.

56:20.668 --> 56:22.690
- Yeah.

56:22.690 --> 56:23.613
Get one to war.

56:26.120 --> 56:29.073
Does the storm, six months?

56:30.160 --> 56:32.830
- Yeah, I mean I cried once
watching apocalypse man,

56:32.830 --> 56:35.853
and I think it, last
very long in the desert.

56:36.780 --> 56:38.480
- Done it rough.

56:38.480 --> 56:40.526
- Coming after it was a movie (mumbles)

56:40.526 --> 56:43.280
just kind of squeezing
my balls from inside.

56:43.280 --> 56:44.930
I like to think of it as a movie,

56:46.298 --> 56:48.420
but I mean I play a tough guy.

56:48.420 --> 56:49.253
Always pretty tough,

56:49.253 --> 56:51.727
but when it comes right
down to it, I failed.

56:53.584 --> 56:56.390
I failed, I need someone
else to do it for me.

56:56.390 --> 56:57.223
- All right.

56:58.460 --> 57:01.363
My balls are (mumbles) squeezed like that.

57:08.260 --> 57:12.953
- Yeah, I just lost a friend in LA.

57:14.320 --> 57:15.153
- Oh man.

57:16.800 --> 57:20.260
Yeah, it's tricky out there man.

57:20.260 --> 57:22.113
- Yeah, sure is.

57:23.457 --> 57:25.010
- You take it easy though.
- All right.

57:25.010 --> 57:26.870
What's your name?
- Brooks.

57:26.870 --> 57:28.923
- Brooks? Charlie.

57:36.800 --> 57:39.843
- Greetings, brothers and
sisters of Killer Selfy.

57:40.690 --> 57:45.323
Namaste, crocodiles and alligators.

57:48.240 --> 57:49.843
They don't die of old age.

57:51.150 --> 57:51.993
They get weak.

57:52.870 --> 57:54.800
They die of starvation.

57:54.800 --> 57:57.400
They become prey to other
crocodiles and alligators.

57:59.420 --> 58:02.370
I've learned to communicate
with these beautiful creatures.

58:03.600 --> 58:05.363
I know you don't believe me,

58:06.350 --> 58:08.333
but today I will prove it to you.

58:09.930 --> 58:10.870
Let us pray.

58:21.146 --> 58:24.229
(indistinct chatter)

58:38.009 --> 58:39.426
- Holy crap, God!

58:41.540 --> 58:42.563
- Hi boys.

58:42.563 --> 58:43.396
(low brooding music)

58:43.396 --> 58:44.590
- It's me Bubbles.

58:47.950 --> 58:52.950
I was so tired of all this dirt around me.

58:56.400 --> 58:57.870
I have an idea.

58:57.870 --> 59:00.613
We should build mountains not valleys.

59:06.990 --> 59:09.540
- Someone's in here, use
the bathroom later please.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.013
Do I know you?

59:23.430 --> 59:25.149
How did you get in here?

59:25.149 --> 59:27.390
(breaths heavily)

59:27.390 --> 59:29.410
I don't know, you need to get out of here.

59:29.410 --> 59:34.410
(loud screams)
(eerie music)

59:41.250 --> 59:44.333
(indistinct chatter)

59:46.030 --> 59:47.200
- Today is the day,

59:47.200 --> 59:49.693
I'm getting silicone injected in my junk.

59:54.070 --> 59:55.110
Throw out the jealous.

59:55.110 --> 59:56.650
I know a lot of you are probably thinking

59:56.650 --> 59:58.200
but let me tell you what it is.

59:59.490 --> 01:00:02.740
A screw inflation is a
temporary body modification,

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.410
that results from sailing

01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:07.173
and in some cases air when
used to fill the scrotum.

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:09.430
- Gilbert.
- Yes.

01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:11.250
- They're ready for you.
- Okay.

01:00:19.314 --> 01:00:21.470
(eerie music)

01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:23.210
- You must be Gilbert.

01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:24.860
- I am, I know doctor.

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:25.820
- Great.

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:28.150
So you ready for your
Silicon injections today?

01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:29.640
- sure I am, but I would
like to go over there

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.140
to that contract I signed earlier today.

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:36.110
- This is just clearing
this up from any negligence,

01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:37.803
minor technicalities.

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:44.100
Do you mind turning your
head and coughing for me.

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:44.933
- Sure.

01:00:45.873 --> 01:00:47.105
(coughs)

01:00:47.105 --> 01:00:50.110
- Good. Good.
(low brooding music)

01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:54.110
The question really is,
who referred you to us?

01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:54.953
- Killer Selfy.

01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:57.620
- Oh, that's great.

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.920
- Yeah, it's a video blog where
I do different procedures.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.120
It says procedures.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.800
I'm getting my scrotum
injected with silicone.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.914
- Now I see, going balls deep, huh?

01:01:05.914 --> 01:01:06.890
(indistinct)

01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:09.960
Nevermind, I'm gonna need you to stand up.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:10.793
- Okay.

01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:13.940
- Here it goes.

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:18.113
Maybe I should get my nurse
if she could hold the camera.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.990
- That's cool.

01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.823
- Nurse.

01:01:24.032 --> 01:01:24.943
- Yes doctor.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.463
- Can you be so kind and film for him?

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:31.593
- With pleasure.

01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:34.053
- I like the sound of that.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.873
This is going to hurt for just a second.

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.754
Breath with me.

01:01:43.754 --> 01:01:46.587
(breaths heavily)

01:01:55.987 --> 01:01:58.570
(loud screams)

01:02:10.348 --> 01:02:12.280
(hip hop music)

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.113
- Oh my!

01:02:16.410 --> 01:02:17.833
So gross.

01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:24.423
Why don't they just want
to do that to themselves?

01:02:28.041 --> 01:02:29.374
It's grand deal.

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.430
- Hi. Sorry, I'm away
from my phone right now.

01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:37.333
Could you leave me a message.

01:02:37.333 --> 01:02:40.133
- Auntie, Why is your phone
going straight to voicemail?

01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:47.600
- I haven't done this in a while.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.533
I guess I really needed the money.

01:02:51.806 --> 01:02:54.053
I mean, I'm really pressing my luck.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.420
I swore the last time
would be the last time.

01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:00.003
(gentle music)

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:06.013
Why do I have a lot on
my mind tonight? (sighs)

01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:10.150
I mean, I know the more you use this app,

01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:11.683
the more likely you might die.

01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:15.603
But like I said, I really need the money.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.230
Hello?

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:21.897
(door creaking)

01:03:23.695 --> 01:03:24.528
(door knocks)

01:03:24.528 --> 01:03:27.643
- Come in Kourt.
(hip hop music)

01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:31.130
Where are you going?

01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:34.225
- I'm moving?

01:03:35.255 --> 01:03:38.353
- Oh no, it's done.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.090
I have no choice.

01:03:42.107 --> 01:03:44.840
- Well, you gotta give
me your new address.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.673
- No, I'm moving out of LA.

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:50.053
- But you love it.

01:03:52.090 --> 01:03:55.150
- Not anymore. (sighs)

01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:55.983
- Why?

01:03:59.170 --> 01:04:01.853
- It's not going very well for me.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:07.510
Being 30 in a way is too old.
(police siren wailing)

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.270
- Kinda crazy, age doesn't matter.

01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:10.540
- It really does.

01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:12.340
Especially modeling.

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:14.390
I mean, you can only be cute for so long.

01:04:16.871 --> 01:04:19.507
And I mean, you're not cute, so.

01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:24.373
You're hot. (chuckles)

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.313
- Thank you.

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:32.450
- This car was supposed to be
here like five minutes ago.

01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:33.693
It's been 20 now.

01:04:35.279 --> 01:04:37.203
- Where you going?
- Airport.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:42.950
- Oh great.

01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:44.023
He's almost here.

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:49.153
- Okay, do you mind if I
catch a ride to my auntie's?

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.100
- I don't know.

01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:53.000
- It's on the way.

01:04:54.318 --> 01:04:55.368
I give you gas money.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:57.770
- You don't have to pay me.

01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:59.410
- We should wait outside.

01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:00.243
- Okay.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:05.120
- Hey, can you drop my
friend off at her aunts?

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.550
Being it'll took 25 minutes.

01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:08.383
- Sure.

01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:15.720
- How many aunties are in?

01:05:21.513 --> 01:05:25.130
- Hey, should we take one more selfie?

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:25.963
- Sure.

01:05:30.731 --> 01:05:31.564
- Thanks.

01:06:00.029 --> 01:06:02.100
- Okay, sure you don't want any money?

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:02.933
- I'm positive.

01:06:04.837 --> 01:06:05.990
- Well, thanks for the ride.

01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:07.833
I really hope you're aunt is okay.

01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:12.525
- Keep in touch.

01:06:12.525 --> 01:06:16.033
- I will definitely. (laughing)

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.233
- Kourtney,

01:06:30.328 --> 01:06:31.560
(low brooding music)

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.613
going somewhere?

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:35.303
I just think.

01:06:37.110 --> 01:06:41.443
Choose this for once.
(breathes heavily)

01:06:43.523 --> 01:06:46.523
(upbeat rock music)

01:06:51.825 --> 01:06:52.658
- Hello.

01:06:56.892 --> 01:06:57.725
Auntie.

01:07:03.090 --> 01:07:03.923
It's me.

01:07:06.604 --> 01:07:07.437
Megan.

01:07:10.644 --> 01:07:11.477
Hello.

01:07:25.134 --> 01:07:29.134
I dint think anything
would happen to my auntie.

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.380
- So, where was your aunt?

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:36.280
- Here's the time.

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.070
- Call me Brooks.

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:40.653
- Yes Brooks.

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:48.660
- You know I don't see your resemblance.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.363
- She was married to my mom's brother.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:07:59.673
- Okay.

01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:07.430
- So, I mean, get this straight.

01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:09.113
So you showed up at her house?

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.260
- Yeah. I went to her house
cause I was worried about her.

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.832
I saw her on this video on an app.

01:08:20.109 --> 01:08:22.109
(sighs)

01:08:23.006 --> 01:08:24.773
- Killer Selfy.

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.792
- You know it?

01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:32.453
Yeah, we've been
investigating out for a while.

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:37.133
- While? Why?

01:08:40.768 --> 01:08:44.613
- (indistinct) Do you know
how many people have died,

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.273
because of this app?

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:52.983
- What? Are you serious?

01:08:55.353 --> 01:08:56.270
- It's no joke.

01:08:56.270 --> 01:09:00.590
- I, yeah, I, I lost my
partner from that fucking app.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.332
- I'm sorry.

01:09:11.859 --> 01:09:13.533
- What do you know about the site?

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.609
- I actually don't know much about it

01:09:17.609 --> 01:09:20.050
other than you can make money.

01:09:20.050 --> 01:09:21.689
- Yeah, you can make money on it,

01:09:21.689 --> 01:09:23.790
but did you read the part about

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.890
your accidental death is not their fault

01:09:28.890 --> 01:09:32.203
in really, really fine print?

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:34.609
- It doesn't say that.

01:09:34.609 --> 01:09:37.013
- Look at your phone, read it.

01:09:38.419 --> 01:09:40.586
It's in really fine print.

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:48.252
- I'm sorry.

01:09:48.252 --> 01:09:51.189
I think, I think my friend
Kourtney might be in trouble.

01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:52.290
She just sent me this.

01:09:55.798 --> 01:09:57.048
- Who is, who's Kourtney?

01:09:57.930 --> 01:09:59.963
- She lives in my building, down the hall.

01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:04.710
- This isn't good.

01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:08.613
I think your friend might be in trouble.

01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:13.773
- (sobbing) Help, help somebody help me.

01:10:13.773 --> 01:10:16.620
I'm in a trunk over Selfy Killer.

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:18.283
I never owned a Selfy Killer.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:23.437
Oh no, oh no, don't... (buzzing sound)

01:10:29.166 --> 01:10:31.666
(eerie music)

01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:37.079
- I'm gonna track her using her GPS.

01:10:37.079 --> 01:10:37.912
- Okay.

01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:41.393
- You know about the GPS?

01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:43.363
- Yeah, of course.

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:47.210
- Kourtney told me about it
when she showed me the app.

01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:52.053
- Okay, well.

01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:55.023
Here we go.

01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:59.943
- Now, let's check up on Selfy Killer.

01:11:01.514 --> 01:11:03.514
(sighs)

01:11:08.190 --> 01:11:09.023
- What is it?

01:11:11.045 --> 01:11:13.045
(sighs)

01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:19.790
- These are pictures of all the deaths.

01:11:21.634 --> 01:11:22.467
- What?

01:11:29.813 --> 01:11:31.396
From the app?
- Yep.

01:11:36.755 --> 01:11:37.623
- (sobbing) Oh God!

01:11:48.407 --> 01:11:50.373
- Gross.

01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:55.607
- It's my auntie,

01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:00.170
we have to do something before
it's too late for Kourtney.

01:12:00.170 --> 01:12:01.360
- Okay. I'll find him.

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:04.630
We'll have to find this creep.

01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:05.590
- I'll find him, okay?

01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:07.456
I just want you to go home, okay?

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:09.680
And stay off that fucking app.

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.723
Please, stay out that app.

01:12:17.904 --> 01:12:19.975
(gentle music)

01:12:19.975 --> 01:12:21.058
- Shit, fuck.

01:12:30.255 --> 01:12:33.827
- (whispers) No, (indistinct),

01:12:33.827 --> 01:12:36.748
I know who the Selfy Killer is.

01:12:36.748 --> 01:12:41.198
Oh no. (sobbing)

01:12:49.399 --> 01:12:50.232
Keep him.

01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:56.652
Okay.

01:12:56.652 --> 01:12:57.902
Okay, one more.

01:13:11.641 --> 01:13:15.425
(upbeat melodic music)

01:13:15.425 --> 01:13:17.175
- Gonna do something.

01:13:18.876 --> 01:13:20.195
I thought he told me not to.

01:13:20.195 --> 01:13:22.362
(sobbing)

01:13:25.842 --> 01:13:28.259
I'm just gonna keep replying.

01:13:46.735 --> 01:13:47.568
- Hi.

01:13:51.054 --> 01:13:53.221
This will be my last post.

01:13:55.210 --> 01:13:56.670
For those of you,

01:13:56.670 --> 01:13:59.623
who are not aware of
the dangers of this app,

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:01.950
I'm gonna tell you,

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.153
right now.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.393
Sorry, Lieutenant Brooks.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.270
I know you told me to stay off the app,

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:14.153
but I can't not warn people.

01:14:17.237 --> 01:14:18.460
(eerie music)

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:21.763
- Can I check out this,
Killer Selfy app again?

01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:28.423
Hmm, what do we have here?

01:14:30.426 --> 01:14:31.476
I can't believe this.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.693
- Here are all those deaths.

01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:38.813
- Oh wow!

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:41.493
- Right?

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.853
I mean, is he responsible for all these?

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:51.970
- He could be.

01:14:51.970 --> 01:14:53.970
I think that's what Jack was working on.

01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.393
- That's weird.

01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:03.220
- I can't believe this.

01:15:04.475 --> 01:15:06.143
That guy is on both videos.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.170
- Hey, wait a second.

01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:20.663
That's a, there's a
Megan's, Megan's profile.

01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:24.363
- That is Megan's profile.

01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:31.833
- I mean all these
people just don't listen.

01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:35.227
The fuck is wrong with them?

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:44.360
Can someone gave me a ride?

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.150
- I can give you a ride Lieutenant.

01:15:50.206 --> 01:15:51.039
- Not you.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.750
- What's wrong with me?

01:15:56.636 --> 01:15:58.757
- Cause I really can't understand you.

01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:04.023
You watched Jack get
killed, and you know what?

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.850
I don't wanna get killed too.

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:11.720
- You're not going to get killed sir.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.930
- I'm being serious.

01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:14.163
- I'm being serious too.

01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:16.590
- You ready, sir?

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:22.713
- Yeah, I'm ready.

01:16:26.443 --> 01:16:29.243
- So please, stop now.

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:37.025
- Hello.

01:16:37.025 --> 01:16:38.040
(eerie music)

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:38.873
Megan.

01:16:42.801 --> 01:16:43.634
Megan.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.790
- Now you're sure she
lives around here, right?

01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:03.863
- Yeah, she lives at the
apartment over there.

01:17:06.176 --> 01:17:07.009
(loud screams)

01:17:07.009 --> 01:17:07.842
- Come on.

01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:11.373
Come on.

01:17:11.373 --> 01:17:12.206
- Megan.

01:17:13.052 --> 01:17:14.570
- Where's that coming from?

01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:16.724
I think that's coming from over.

01:17:16.724 --> 01:17:18.724
- You go around back, I go around front.

01:17:19.814 --> 01:17:23.814
- (sobbing loudly) Help, Brooks.

01:17:40.365 --> 01:17:41.700
(laughs)

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.433
- I'll teach you detective.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:48.153
Take a look.

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.253
Do you think you're safe?

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.663
You're as good as dead.

01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:59.323
Time is running out.

01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:05.863
If you wanna live, you better do as I say.

01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:11.973
Detective, if you wanna save this girl,

01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:20.333
watch Killer Selfy in 30 minutes.

01:18:21.995 --> 01:18:24.078
(laughs)

01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:31.470
- Do you have a track?

01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:32.313
- Almost sir.

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:36.393
- Any day now.

01:18:41.210 --> 01:18:42.520
- Hello detectives.

01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:45.023
Looking for someone?

01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:48.303
Light of my life.

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.133
Don't be scared.

01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:54.813
This won't hurt.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.080
You won't feel the fang.

01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:05.526
(sobbing loudly)

01:19:05.526 --> 01:19:08.359
(laughing loudly)

01:19:10.771 --> 01:19:13.104
- Somebody help me. Help me.

01:19:17.078 --> 01:19:19.578
(eerie music)

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:28.040
- I think I found it sir.

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.290
- Where?

01:19:29.290 --> 01:19:31.140
- It's at the old warehouse Downtown?

01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.223
- I know that place.

01:19:38.951 --> 01:19:40.130
(low brooding music)

01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:40.963
- Jesus.

01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:43.693
I guess ugly.

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:50.423
Nice mustache but what a waste?

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.050
Its just like a cartoon.

01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:53.953
Fuck.

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:56.353
Fuck.

01:19:59.416 --> 01:20:00.416
Life's ugly.

01:20:05.006 --> 01:20:07.006
(sighs)

01:20:09.977 --> 01:20:12.838
- (sobbing) Hello.

01:20:12.838 --> 01:20:13.671
(loud screams)

01:20:13.671 --> 01:20:15.461
- Detectives, please, no
please help me, please.

01:20:15.461 --> 01:20:16.461
- Detective.

01:20:17.801 --> 01:20:19.051
- Please help.

01:20:20.576 --> 01:20:21.409
Please.

01:20:21.409 --> 01:20:22.409
- Your wild.

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:25.760
- Detectives.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:26.640
- Here we go.

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.060
- Are we being filmed?

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:28.893
- Oh yeah.

01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:35.783
- What does this look like to you?

01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:39.913
- Why would they be dead?

01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:42.343
They weren't filmed.

01:20:43.730 --> 01:20:45.883
Being killed.

01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:51.253
It never stops.

01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:54.170
Cops will never understand that.

01:20:54.170 --> 01:20:56.113
Look at me moment.

01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:02.830
If people only knew what can
happen if they record live.

01:21:04.181 --> 01:21:06.081
(eerie music)
- They just don't care.

01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:11.773
They just wanna be famous.

01:21:13.630 --> 01:21:14.913
Look out detectives.

01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:18.193
We're all on Killer Selfy.

01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:21.853
I am,

01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:27.903
the selfy killer.

01:21:36.982 --> 01:21:38.315
- You know what?

01:21:39.190 --> 01:21:41.310
Keep your gun on him, all right?

01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:42.900
- Yes Lieutenant.

01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:46.253
If he moves, the ball
his fucking head off.

01:21:54.919 --> 01:21:57.002
(laughs)

01:22:01.810 --> 01:22:03.610
- Take this garbage away.

01:22:03.610 --> 01:22:04.460
- Yes Lieutenant.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.570
We're just getting started.

01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:09.403
- Who's we?

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.723
- Don't you understand?

01:22:20.107 --> 01:22:22.107
(sighs)

01:22:25.491 --> 01:22:27.658
(sobbing)

01:22:33.781 --> 01:22:35.160
- Papa, I'm gonna die.

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.510
- No, you're not gonna die.

01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:39.053
All right.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:42.433
You're okay?

01:22:43.570 --> 01:22:44.403
- I'm neither,

01:22:44.403 --> 01:22:46.373
this is not the first time
I'm being tied up in LA.

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:49.540
- I'm a little bit traumatized.

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:51.320
I'm pretty sure that
every time I take a selfie

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:53.550
for now I'm gonna have nightmares.

01:22:53.550 --> 01:22:56.289
But otherwise, I think we'll survive.

01:22:56.289 --> 01:22:57.788
- Okay.

01:22:57.788 --> 01:22:58.914
Be sure, you're gonna be okay.

01:22:58.914 --> 01:23:01.475
(gentle music)

01:23:01.475 --> 01:23:04.508
You don't need to worry at all.

01:23:04.508 --> 01:23:05.341
All right.

01:23:13.804 --> 01:23:15.721
- Hey Lieutenant,
- Yap.

01:23:16.907 --> 01:23:17.740
- thanks.

01:23:20.167 --> 01:23:21.500
- That's my job.

01:23:25.988 --> 01:23:28.316
(low brooding music)

01:23:28.316 --> 01:23:29.149
- Nice.

01:23:32.306 --> 01:23:34.556
Very good Megan, very good.

01:23:39.538 --> 01:23:41.185
You're beautiful, ain't you?

01:23:41.185 --> 01:23:43.018
You're a good actress.

01:23:50.044 --> 01:23:52.294
(clapping)

01:23:55.518 --> 01:23:56.351
Bravo.

01:23:59.330 --> 01:24:00.330
Bravo Megan.

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:11.847
(air whooshing)

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.830
- What's this fucking dog?
(dog barks)

01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:17.980
It's gonna need a home.

01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:20.420
I thought about keeping it but,

01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:22.840
it shit on my floor, immediately.

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:26.130
So, once you shit on my floor,

01:24:26.130 --> 01:24:29.610
you're out unless you can
clean it up and suck my dick.

01:24:29.610 --> 01:24:31.660
And then there's a chance, I'll keep you.

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:33.994
- Come in.

01:24:33.994 --> 01:24:36.411
(indistinct)

01:24:37.442 --> 01:24:38.542
- Is that Haley's dog.

01:24:39.390 --> 01:24:44.060
- Yeah, I guarantee that
dog's a lot happier now,

01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:47.810
without Haley just dragging it around.

01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:49.060
Trying to get more likes.

01:24:51.490 --> 01:24:53.414
- I think you're right.

01:24:53.414 --> 01:24:54.330
But thank you.

01:24:54.330 --> 01:24:56.030
I'm gonna name him Little Charlie.

01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:59.770
- I don't think you
have an issue with that.

01:24:59.770 --> 01:25:02.232
- You'll charge me more
rent for Little Charlie.

01:25:02.232 --> 01:25:03.830
Little Charlie.

01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:06.010
- Nah, I wouldn't do that.

01:25:08.502 --> 01:25:09.717
We are great.

01:25:09.717 --> 01:25:11.950
Really proud of you.

01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:13.130
You're an asset.

01:25:13.130 --> 01:25:13.963
Help me out.

01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:20.460
- And if I'm such an
asset, where's my asset?

01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:21.360
Where's the money?

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.550
- It's already in your account.

01:25:26.642 --> 01:25:31.642
- Yeah.

01:25:32.684 --> 01:25:33.517
Yap,

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.513
it is.

01:25:35.513 --> 01:25:37.980
- You know it's amazing how
I give you a compliment.

01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:41.030
I say you're an asset, I opened up.

01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:44.933
I said something that mattered
and you didn't hear it.

01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:50.377
All you heard was the money you wanted.

01:25:51.810 --> 01:25:53.603
Want, want, want.

01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:55.660
That's the world we live in man.

01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:56.493
No, one's happy.

01:25:56.493 --> 01:25:58.600
They all just want something else.

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:01.030
They don't even know who they are.

01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.863
They want more likes.

01:26:01.863 --> 01:26:03.333
They want more followers.

01:26:04.845 --> 01:26:06.000
(gentle music)

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.613
They even don't even know what love is.

01:26:11.106 --> 01:26:12.356
It's all about the money.

01:26:13.924 --> 01:26:14.757
It's all ego.

01:26:22.730 --> 01:26:24.770
- Don't forget about me.

01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:26.207
- And me.
- Hey, who's this?

01:26:26.207 --> 01:26:27.943
I'm one of Charlie's girls.

01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:30.581
- Take a selfie Emma.

01:26:30.581 --> 01:26:31.414
- I am.

01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:38.581
- Well, that's the Killer Selfy.

01:26:38.581 --> 01:26:40.438
(group laughing)

01:26:40.438 --> 01:26:42.120
- That's the money shot.

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.703
(gentle music)

01:26:52.570 --> 01:26:53.830
- He fellow fans,

01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:55.373
it's be bikini girl again.

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:59.250
Today is the 24th day of my hike.

01:26:59.250 --> 01:27:01.759
I think I have one more day to go,

01:27:01.759 --> 01:27:02.926
so stay tuned.

01:27:05.615 --> 01:27:08.865
(upbeat melodic music)
