06:04.361 --> 06:07.465
If you have my money,
I have your Judas.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.918
His name is Oleg.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.606
<i>Yes, my friend, the CIA.</i>

10:33.501 --> 10:35.259
Good job.

10:35.261 --> 10:37.850
You should've told me you
were running a secondary op.

10:37.852 --> 10:39.035
The risk was worth it.

10:39.037 --> 10:41.466
Besides, I knew
you could handle it.

10:41.468 --> 10:43.514
Like I know you can handle
a follow-up action.

10:43.516 --> 10:45.722
I thought ExSo
was cutting me loose.

10:45.724 --> 10:48.442
They are, but FullSpec
have agreed to bond you out.

10:48.444 --> 10:49.530
Come on.

10:49.532 --> 10:51.002
We just received
actionable intel

10:51.004 --> 10:52.410
that a tier-one target
is in London.

10:52.412 --> 10:54.267
We want him off the table.

11:07.068 --> 11:09.754
Leigh said this flight would
be full of fucking reprobates

11:09.756 --> 11:11.192
and degenerates,
but I didn't believe her

11:11.194 --> 11:12.633
until I saw your sorry ass.

11:12.635 --> 11:14.745
- How the fuck are you, Jackie?
- Jesus. Mike.

11:14.747 --> 11:17.144
What the hell are you doing
here? I thought you retired.

11:17.146 --> 11:19.258
Retire? Shit. I can't retire.
I've got three ex-wives.

11:19.260 --> 11:22.233
Anyway. You look like shit,
but you know that.

11:22.235 --> 11:24.761
Still freebasing go-pills?

11:24.763 --> 11:28.568
If you guys are done
bonding, we're on a clock.

11:28.570 --> 11:31.065
Intel says we have exactly
twelve hours to hit the target.

11:31.067 --> 11:32.666
I work alone. You know that.

11:34.394 --> 11:37.784
- No offense, old man.
- Yeah, okay.

11:37.786 --> 11:40.439
Look. This is not some
third-rate Haji we're going after, OK?

11:40.441 --> 11:44.216
This is a bad guy. Top of
the President's kill list.

11:44.218 --> 11:46.842
Brennan will be point,
but it's my op.

11:48.058 --> 11:50.199
Collins, I worked my ass off
to get you cleared.

11:50.201 --> 11:53.783
Why's that? EXSo afraid they got
another nut-job on their hands?

11:53.785 --> 11:55.513
You know. Just...

11:57.561 --> 11:58.903
This is a FullSpec op.

11:58.905 --> 12:00.311
Oh...

12:00.313 --> 12:02.102
That other morally
considerate employer.

12:02.104 --> 12:04.246
I hear they got their
plausible deniability sewn up

12:04.248 --> 12:06.006
tighter than a camel's asshole.

12:06.008 --> 12:09.145
If you don't want to go home,
London is what I got.

12:10.360 --> 12:11.830
I need you.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.654
<i>Prepare to take off.</i>

12:13.656 --> 12:15.958
Be a team player.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.878
I got your back, Mike. Always.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.022
Yo!

12:20.024 --> 12:21.398
Are you people deaf?

12:21.400 --> 12:22.902
Pilot said sit down,
strap in already.

12:22.904 --> 12:25.174
I'm trying to scalp
this motherfucker by tonight.

12:25.176 --> 12:26.710
Jackie Collins, Pete Samuelson.

12:26.712 --> 12:27.702
Pete, Jackie.

12:27.704 --> 12:29.526
Pete and I did Libya together.

12:29.528 --> 12:31.925
He was a prick then.
He's a prick now.

12:31.927 --> 12:33.462
But he's a damn fine operator.

12:33.464 --> 12:36.758
Well, the old man's wrong.
I'm even better than that.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.103
I'm fact, I'm the best.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.198
Are you fucking kidding me?

13:27.796 --> 13:29.522
What the hell
is Collins doing here?

13:29.524 --> 13:30.803
What are you talking about?

13:30.805 --> 13:33.395
What am I talking about?
Jesus Christ, Leigh.

13:33.397 --> 13:35.826
I'm talking about a messed-up
war junkie who won't go home,

13:35.828 --> 13:37.524
because you people
won't let him.

13:38.549 --> 13:40.691
I need Collins in this fight.

13:40.693 --> 13:43.891
And so do you, Brennan.
I thought you were friends.

13:43.893 --> 13:46.194
No, we are friends, and
as his friend, I'm asking you.

13:46.196 --> 13:48.594
Do the guy a solid.
Cut him loose. Send him home.

13:48.596 --> 13:49.906
His wife just
gave birth to a kid

13:49.908 --> 13:52.786
he hasn't even laid eyes on,
for Christ's sake.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.994
We've all made sacrifices.
He can handle it.

13:54.996 --> 13:56.722
Sure, 'til he blows up
in your face,

13:56.724 --> 13:59.345
and then,
that shit's on you, honey.

13:59.347 --> 14:01.553
Uh-oh.

14:01.555 --> 14:03.476
Where's the first half
of my money?

14:07.540 --> 14:08.883
Check it again.

14:13.938 --> 14:16.593
A million fucking bucks,
just like that.

14:16.595 --> 14:17.937
I love Terror Tuesdays.

14:17.939 --> 14:19.569
No more Terror Tuesdays.

14:19.571 --> 14:21.552
Now it's terror
all day, every day.

14:21.554 --> 14:24.240
But screw up, and you get nothing
but a Title Fifty disavow.

14:24.242 --> 14:26.320
Oh, I haven't missed
a shot my whole life.

14:26.322 --> 14:30.192
And landing in some prison cell
is not in my game plan.

14:30.194 --> 14:32.176
So, then, who's the lucky
son of a bitch

14:32.178 --> 14:33.970
who tops the President's
kill list?

14:37.554 --> 14:39.025
Terry McKnight.

14:39.027 --> 14:42.512
He was a deep cover operative,
based in Pakistan.

14:42.514 --> 14:44.559
He became a Muslim
to better understand his enemy.

14:44.561 --> 14:46.575
Or so he claimed.

14:46.577 --> 14:48.784
Then the ISI dug
their claws into him.

14:48.786 --> 14:50.287
Turned him.

14:50.289 --> 14:52.304
For three years,
he fed them our intel.

14:52.306 --> 14:55.087
They gave that intel
to the Taliban.

14:55.089 --> 14:56.527
Got a lot of our guys killed.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.255
Haji hunter by day,

14:58.257 --> 15:00.654
personal crusader
by night, shit.

15:00.656 --> 15:03.215
We're never gonna win this war.

15:03.217 --> 15:05.071
What about the man's
due process?

15:05.073 --> 15:07.086
He gave up his rights
as an American

15:07.088 --> 15:08.687
when he became a terrorist.

15:08.689 --> 15:09.935
Fuck his due process.

15:11.729 --> 15:14.543
Oh, um, I'm sorry,
did I just...

15:14.545 --> 15:15.695
interrupt?

15:15.697 --> 15:17.519
It's a good story, spook.
It is.

15:17.521 --> 15:19.982
But I heard
something different.

15:19.984 --> 15:21.422
I heard you guys fucked him

15:21.424 --> 15:22.382
when his cover was blown.

15:22.384 --> 15:24.270
Straight up disavow.

15:24.272 --> 15:25.808
Are you done?

15:28.688 --> 15:31.853
McKnight's there to do a deal with a
group of Russian ex-FSB officers.

15:31.855 --> 15:33.486
What the deal's for,
we don't know,

15:33.488 --> 15:36.365
but we know he's working
with this man, Farooq Hassan.

15:36.367 --> 15:39.373
Hassan's a Syrian national.
He moves intel, guns, people,

15:39.375 --> 15:42.061
but he's not ideological.
He's strictly about the money.

15:42.063 --> 15:44.173
He's not the only one.

15:44.175 --> 15:47.021
Private sector intelligence
provides him legitimate cover.

15:47.023 --> 15:49.486
These are his known
associates.

15:50.959 --> 15:51.917
This is where you start.

15:51.919 --> 15:53.006
Wait.

15:54.030 --> 15:55.407
Go back one.

15:59.310 --> 16:00.427
There.

16:00.429 --> 16:02.061
Tony Deighton.

16:03.151 --> 16:04.652
So, kill the suspense, already.

16:04.654 --> 16:07.884
Saved his ass in Afghanistan
a couple of years ago.

16:07.886 --> 16:10.861
- That was good of you.
- Yeah, he thought so, too.

16:12.047 --> 16:14.732
IED almost blew him in half.

16:14.734 --> 16:15.820
Look, this guy's
a buddy of yours,

16:15.822 --> 16:17.419
and it turns out
he's a bad guy,

16:17.421 --> 16:18.958
maybe you should sit
this one out there, Jackie boy.

16:20.461 --> 16:22.219
We were tight back then.

16:22.221 --> 16:23.788
He's my brother.

16:23.790 --> 16:25.484
Like you, Mike.

16:25.486 --> 16:26.603
He's a good operator.

16:26.605 --> 16:28.429
No way he's involved
in this shit.

17:23.818 --> 17:24.971
But greed.

17:26.858 --> 17:29.034
Greed is bad for business.

17:32.043 --> 17:33.384
Mr. McKnight...

17:33.386 --> 17:35.367
You should've taken
the CIA's advice

17:35.369 --> 17:37.290
and used encryption.

17:40.138 --> 17:41.320
Please.

17:41.322 --> 17:44.743
I never meet... CIA, I just...

17:44.745 --> 17:48.199
- do it through phone...
- Don't you beg.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.833
Now, give me a name.

17:51.722 --> 17:55.048
Before 20 men enter
your house and...

17:55.050 --> 17:57.225
violate your children.

17:58.569 --> 18:02.665
While your wife
drowns in their semen.

18:05.610 --> 18:07.048
Leigh.

18:09.353 --> 18:10.760
Leigh.

18:13.768 --> 18:15.432
Please!

18:42.535 --> 18:43.686
It's clean.

18:53.990 --> 18:56.133
Deighton, how you doing, man?
It's Jack Collins.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.151
Yeah, me too, brother.
Me too.

19:00.583 --> 19:04.483
Look, I need to meet. I'm on
the clock and I need a favor.

19:04.485 --> 19:07.429
I appreciate it.
All right, I'll see you there.

19:17.478 --> 19:19.875
So, Jackie, how's the family?

19:19.877 --> 19:22.244
When's the last time
you were Stateside?

19:22.246 --> 19:24.195
Hey, Mike,

19:24.197 --> 19:25.989
go fuck yourself, OK?

19:28.102 --> 19:29.762
Look,

19:29.764 --> 19:32.322
You're gonna pledge your
allegiance to that girl?

19:32.324 --> 19:37.219
To the CIA, to a system that doesn't
give a rat's dick about you?

19:37.221 --> 19:38.627
Fuck loyalty.

19:38.629 --> 19:40.258
Go home, Jack.

19:40.260 --> 19:42.114
Meet your kid. Huh?

19:42.116 --> 19:43.459
Be a father.

19:43.461 --> 19:45.474
You're father
of the year now, Mike?

19:45.476 --> 19:47.011
Hell no.
I'm a three-time loser

19:47.013 --> 19:48.322
who should've been
home for his kids.

19:48.324 --> 19:50.275
Instead, I've gotta keep
taking out bad guys,

19:50.277 --> 19:52.481
so I don't drown
in goddamn alimony.

19:52.483 --> 19:54.275
Fucking witches.

20:14.915 --> 20:18.593
There's my
favorite fucking cowboy!

20:18.595 --> 20:21.473
Deighton,
you son of a bitch.

20:21.475 --> 20:24.801
- How you doing, man?
- You're fucking looking at it, mate. Never better. You?

20:24.803 --> 20:26.336
Good, man. I'm good. Yeah.

20:26.338 --> 20:28.160
This is Mike Brennan
and Pete Samuelson.

20:28.162 --> 20:29.537
Tony Deighton.

20:29.539 --> 20:31.073
- Nice to meet you, man.
- Nice to meet you.

20:31.075 --> 20:33.696
I thought you said
this guy was the shit.

20:33.698 --> 20:35.904
He don't look like much.

20:35.906 --> 20:37.952
You don't look like much.

20:37.954 --> 20:39.138
This prick Delta?

20:40.609 --> 20:42.016
Come on, grab a seat.

20:42.018 --> 20:43.040
Alan.

20:47.777 --> 20:51.231
So... the CIA still reckons
it can win the war on terror

20:51.233 --> 20:53.087
by outsourcing it
to fucking cowboys?

20:53.089 --> 20:54.431
I call that desperation.

20:54.433 --> 20:56.128
It's pretty fucking tragic.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.983
But you look like you
do OK for yourself.

20:57.985 --> 20:59.231
I do all right.

20:59.233 --> 21:00.831
War machine provides.

21:00.833 --> 21:03.551
That's the beauty
of our capitalist system.

21:03.553 --> 21:06.366
That and we're all brothers
together. Right?

21:06.368 --> 21:07.935
Well, it's not like
we can quit.

21:07.937 --> 21:11.422
We miss the action too much,
that's our trouble.

21:11.424 --> 21:13.342
How's the family?

21:13.344 --> 21:14.655
Ah, you know.

21:14.657 --> 21:16.222
Working on it.

21:16.224 --> 21:17.535
Jesus.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.327
Yours?

21:19.329 --> 21:22.366
Joanne sacked me off for
some fucking hairdresser,

21:22.368 --> 21:23.774
if you can believe that shit.

21:23.776 --> 21:25.565
Lisa's shagging
anything that moves

21:25.567 --> 21:26.781
just to spite her old man.

21:26.783 --> 21:29.405
She's 16 fucking years old.

21:29.407 --> 21:30.622
All good, really.

21:30.624 --> 21:33.216
Poor bastard.

21:34.399 --> 21:36.157
Fuck, it's good
to see you, man.

21:36.159 --> 21:38.045
You too, man. You too.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.252
It's like old times, huh?

21:40.254 --> 21:42.239
Just glad to see
you're still in the fight.

21:45.919 --> 21:47.805
To bounty hunters.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.629
Who's a bounty hunter?

21:49.631 --> 21:51.037
I'm a shadow warrior.

21:51.039 --> 21:52.542
You're a fucking what?

21:54.783 --> 21:56.511
Jesus.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.132
Right, what do you need?

21:59.134 --> 22:01.115
Our intel says he worked
with you guys

22:01.117 --> 22:03.901
in Syria back, uh,
back when "6" ran him.

22:06.494 --> 22:08.124
Yeah, sure.

22:08.126 --> 22:10.652
Farooq Hassan.
He's a good bloke.

22:10.654 --> 22:12.317
You guys tight?

22:12.319 --> 22:14.236
I helped him set up here.

22:14.238 --> 22:16.796
So, question is,
what do you lot want with him?

22:16.798 --> 22:20.443
He running some international terrorist
organization I don't know about?

22:22.557 --> 22:24.763
You're funny.

22:24.765 --> 22:28.091
It is so in your interest
to cooperate with us.

22:28.093 --> 22:29.339
Deighton.

22:29.341 --> 22:31.421
We just wanna talk
to the guy, no big deal.

22:32.796 --> 22:34.939
Come on, D, it's for me.

22:34.941 --> 22:36.027
Yeah, sure,

22:36.029 --> 22:37.243
and I'd say "no problem, mate,"

22:37.245 --> 22:39.131
if it was just you
asking and not

22:39.133 --> 22:40.667
three bounty hunters.

22:40.669 --> 22:42.650
'Scuse me, shadow warriors.

22:42.652 --> 22:43.964
Know what I mean?

22:45.212 --> 22:48.699
Farooq's my brother. Like you.

22:48.701 --> 22:49.722
Look, we're not here

22:49.724 --> 22:51.097
to scalp the guy, all right?

22:51.099 --> 22:52.666
And I don't wanna get
into details,

22:52.668 --> 22:55.802
but our action does not
conflict with your interests.

22:55.804 --> 22:56.924
You have my word.

22:59.068 --> 23:02.555
And we can also pay you for
any information he provides.

23:04.572 --> 23:05.628
All right.

23:16.539 --> 23:18.233
Langley wants an update.

23:18.235 --> 23:20.313
Fucking asshole O'Neil's
on the warpath.

23:20.315 --> 23:22.201
Said you'd better not
fuck this up.

23:22.203 --> 23:24.281
- Here's that intel you wanted.
- Thanks.

23:24.283 --> 23:27.835
Shoot a specter gunship at
night when we have the chance...

23:35.193 --> 23:37.304
Nah, Syria's fun,
but nothing like the good times

23:37.306 --> 23:39.225
you and me had
in Afghanistan, mate.

23:39.227 --> 23:41.240
Yeah, you never did thank me
for saving your ass.

23:41.242 --> 23:43.320
You fucking prick.

23:43.322 --> 23:45.271
You ran over a fucking IED.

23:45.273 --> 23:47.161
Yeah, whatever, man. You were
crying like a little bitch

23:47.163 --> 23:48.567
when I pulled you
out of that thing.

23:48.569 --> 23:50.168
I miss it, though, you know?

23:50.170 --> 23:51.831
Fighting the Tali,

23:51.833 --> 23:53.528
getting in close and fucking

23:53.530 --> 23:54.999
doing the bloke.

23:55.001 --> 23:56.695
Sticking that knife in deep,

23:56.697 --> 23:59.319
twisting it, seeing the poor
Haji's lights go out.

23:59.321 --> 24:01.751
Tali were some fierce
fucking <i>hombres,</i> man.

24:01.753 --> 24:03.607
Yeah, we took a giant shit
in their backyard,

24:03.609 --> 24:05.145
What d'you expect?

24:10.712 --> 24:12.504
Almost there, mate.

24:15.511 --> 24:17.590
All right, just round
this next bend.

24:17.592 --> 24:18.904
Hassan's gonna meet us there.

24:44.375 --> 24:46.388
Argh! What the fuck?

24:46.390 --> 24:48.276
Samuelson, quit fucking around.
Grab the M4s.

24:48.278 --> 24:51.028
Don't fucking
shoot him. We need him alive.

24:51.030 --> 24:52.629
We gotta catch the prick first.

24:52.631 --> 24:55.350
Slow down.
It's a fucking ambush.

25:24.758 --> 25:26.420
Take the shot.

25:29.653 --> 25:31.221
Terry McKnight says hello.

25:37.397 --> 25:38.676
Collins!

25:44.916 --> 25:46.323
He's dead!

25:46.325 --> 25:48.725
What are you doing?
Move! Move!

25:56.820 --> 25:57.876
Move!

26:09.715 --> 26:10.835
Move!

26:21.330 --> 26:23.281
What's done is done.

26:23.283 --> 26:26.034
Brennan's death changes nothing.
We still have a job to do.

26:34.705 --> 26:36.977
You need to cut Samuelson
loose before he gets killed.

26:36.979 --> 26:38.768
Are you fucking kidding me?

26:38.770 --> 26:39.984
I need to go at this alone.

26:39.986 --> 26:41.872
It was me who saved you,
dumbass.

26:41.874 --> 26:42.929
He's baggage I don't need.

26:42.931 --> 26:44.848
And he's a fucking liability.

26:44.850 --> 26:46.576
You took one
too many go-pills.

26:46.578 --> 26:48.401
Brennan's death is on you.

26:49.617 --> 26:51.312
Oh, you want to go,
motherfucker?

26:51.314 --> 26:52.336
All right, knock it off.

26:52.338 --> 26:53.967
Find a way to work together

26:53.969 --> 26:56.239
or you're done. Both of you.

26:56.241 --> 26:58.063
And you're on
the next flight home.

26:58.065 --> 27:00.976
I need you to
draw Deighton out,

27:00.978 --> 27:02.959
extract him and bring him here.

27:02.961 --> 27:04.718
Keith and Dave will assist.

27:04.720 --> 27:06.735
Look, Leigh.
If we track Deighton,

27:06.737 --> 27:08.591
we've got a better chance at
locating McKnight than ambushing.

27:08.593 --> 27:10.447
What, you want to
drive around all night?

27:10.449 --> 27:11.823
We need to fight smart.

27:11.825 --> 27:14.478
Collins, no one doubts
your commitment, OK?

27:14.480 --> 27:16.366
We're all upset about Brennan.

27:16.368 --> 27:18.030
Just take a minute.

27:18.032 --> 27:20.432
And then tell me your head
is still in the game.

27:21.904 --> 27:23.151
You'll take command
on the ground.

27:23.153 --> 27:24.910
Roger that.

27:24.912 --> 27:27.696
What happens to
Brennan's share?

27:30.639 --> 27:33.614
What the fuck is wrong with you?

27:34.831 --> 27:36.526
Fucking cocksucker!

27:36.528 --> 27:39.949
Goddammit, enough!

27:39.951 --> 27:42.542
If either one of you
jeopardizes my operation,

27:42.544 --> 27:44.719
it'll be the last thing
you ever do.

27:46.415 --> 27:47.951
Now, go!

28:17.357 --> 28:19.662
- Deighton, let me explain...
- Shut the fuck up.

28:20.846 --> 28:22.508
Now I gotta throw
bodies at this.

28:22.510 --> 28:24.107
You ever fuck up
an ambush again,

28:24.109 --> 28:25.611
I will fucking shoot you.
You understand?

28:25.613 --> 28:27.403
This ends before it begins.

28:27.405 --> 28:29.324
I'm fucking on it, boss.

28:29.326 --> 28:31.052
All right. Hassan.

28:31.054 --> 28:33.003
You're blown, mate. Take off.

28:33.005 --> 28:35.851
Roger that.

28:35.853 --> 28:38.987
D, are we really gonna go
to war with the fucking CIA?

28:38.989 --> 28:42.027
Just concentrate on
protecting our investment.

28:42.029 --> 28:43.500
I'll take care of the rest.

28:58.892 --> 29:00.937
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
we're on the move.

29:00.939 --> 29:03.018
You were right, the CIA sent
a bunch of county hunters

29:03.020 --> 29:04.745
to take you out.
We clipped the team leader.

29:04.747 --> 29:06.858
One of them is an old friend
of yours, I believe.

29:06.860 --> 29:08.553
Saved your life in, uh,

29:08.555 --> 29:11.179
Afghanistan or
something like that?

29:12.459 --> 29:14.185
Yeah, Collins.

29:14.187 --> 29:16.649
Ex-SEAL. Almost on my level.

29:16.651 --> 29:18.153
Almost.

29:18.155 --> 29:20.712
Those SEALs are as good
as it gets, Deighton.

29:20.714 --> 29:24.168
Terry. Your security
is paramount to me.

29:24.170 --> 29:26.889
I'm taking you to the boat.

29:26.891 --> 29:28.648
Ivan here'll take care
of you now.

29:28.650 --> 29:30.827
Is that really how you
wanna run your opsec?

29:34.378 --> 29:37.351
I keep you moving, Terry.
I keep you alive.

29:37.353 --> 29:40.072
Besides we're done here, right?
There's no more chatter.

29:41.418 --> 29:43.783
You stay where you are.
Listen, Anthony...

29:43.785 --> 29:46.024
Bloke who gave me this,

29:46.026 --> 29:48.615
he got introduced to
the way of the knife.

29:48.617 --> 29:51.144
Him and his whole
fucking family.

29:51.146 --> 29:53.128
You're fine.

29:53.130 --> 29:55.786
Just don't get sentimental
on me, Deighton.

29:56.969 --> 29:58.793
Not with the money
I'm paying you.

30:01.096 --> 30:02.279
Oh, I'll put Collins down,

30:02.281 --> 30:04.328
don't you worry about that.

30:04.330 --> 30:06.087
Let's just not give him
the opportunity

30:06.089 --> 30:07.879
to put you down, Terry.

30:07.881 --> 30:10.152
Not before the account's
been settled.

30:43.303 --> 30:47.205
So this friend of yours,
Collins,

30:47.207 --> 30:49.542
he say anything
about his handler?

30:49.544 --> 30:50.949
No.

30:50.951 --> 30:52.038
Something I should know?

30:55.239 --> 30:57.092
Terry?

30:57.094 --> 30:59.014
This is where you
learn to trust me.

31:00.742 --> 31:03.973
You know what the Russians
say about trust?

31:03.975 --> 31:05.957
"Trust in God,

31:05.959 --> 31:08.678
and mind your own
fucking business."

31:13.543 --> 31:15.558
Her name is Leigh Allen

31:16.518 --> 31:18.915
and she's a true believer.

31:18.917 --> 31:22.115
You could say
I'm her special project.

31:22.117 --> 31:23.811
Blames me for killing
her father

31:23.813 --> 31:26.530
when he and I were stationed
in South Waziristan together.

31:26.532 --> 31:28.163
Did you?

31:28.165 --> 31:29.764
She believes it.

31:29.766 --> 31:31.267
The reality is...

31:31.269 --> 31:32.869
more complicated.

31:35.365 --> 31:38.147
Like Waziristan itself, you...

31:38.149 --> 31:41.859
know less when you leave,
than you do when you arrive.

31:41.861 --> 31:43.043
So?

31:43.045 --> 31:44.418
So,

31:44.420 --> 31:47.074
she's a very confused and

31:47.076 --> 31:48.740
angry young woman.

31:49.925 --> 31:52.066
And angry and confused
young women

31:52.068 --> 31:53.122
do stupid things.

31:53.124 --> 31:54.370
Not stupid.

31:54.372 --> 31:56.578
Dangerous.

31:56.580 --> 31:59.364
And she's got an endless
black budget to do them with.

32:43.745 --> 32:44.768
Jackie,

32:44.770 --> 32:46.496
<i>you're upset about Brennan.</i>

32:46.498 --> 32:49.568
I understand. It's tough
losing a bloke like that.

32:49.570 --> 32:51.552
And, you know, I'd be a liar
if I said I didn't enjoy it.

32:51.554 --> 32:53.280
But it's not personal.

32:53.282 --> 32:55.231
Right? It's not personal,
it's just business.

32:55.233 --> 32:58.879
What part of murdering
my friend isn't personal?

32:58.881 --> 33:00.545
<i>You know how this
is gonna end, right?</i>

33:01.568 --> 33:03.551
Yeah, I reckon I do.

33:03.553 --> 33:04.991
I've gotta put you down, D.

33:04.993 --> 33:08.254
Listen, do you really want
your kid to grow up

33:08.256 --> 33:10.721
<i>without his dad, Jackie?</i>

33:12.289 --> 33:14.527
I'm offering you an out, mate.

33:14.529 --> 33:16.095
Go home, go home now.

33:16.097 --> 33:17.854
<i>You've given enough
to the cause.</i>

33:17.856 --> 33:19.201
You're over-reaching.

33:20.385 --> 33:22.654
<i>Fine, this time, I'm not
going to save you.</i>

33:22.656 --> 33:24.001
I'm gonna bury you.

33:26.112 --> 33:27.198
<i>Why'd you turn, man?</i>

33:27.200 --> 33:30.047
It can't just be
about the money.

33:30.049 --> 33:34.335
Can't it? You think
you're not expendable?

33:35.680 --> 33:37.438
Tell you what,
you try telling

33:37.440 --> 33:38.557
the Afghan story
to your handler.

33:38.559 --> 33:40.093
See how she reacts.

33:40.095 --> 33:41.566
Because when the ends
justify the means,

33:41.568 --> 33:43.965
the CIA will dump you
in a fucking heartbeat

33:43.967 --> 33:45.248
<i>to get what it wants.</i>

34:41.085 --> 34:42.781
One, two, tree.

34:59.932 --> 35:01.979
Let's hope Leigh
disabled the alarm.

35:22.299 --> 35:23.289
It's multi-locked.

35:23.291 --> 35:24.635
Step aside.

35:33.723 --> 35:36.186
D, the Yanks just
broke into our office.

35:37.562 --> 35:39.128
All right.

35:39.130 --> 35:40.794
Let's go earn some money.

35:50.937 --> 35:52.825
Take a go-pill.

35:54.938 --> 35:56.217
Let's go.

36:14.584 --> 36:15.606
Right, we're almost there.

36:15.608 --> 36:16.791
I don't want any fireworks

36:16.793 --> 36:18.681
outside my office,
understood?

36:39.896 --> 36:41.686
What the hell are you doing?

36:41.688 --> 36:44.693
Fun's not done yet,
fucknuts.

36:44.695 --> 36:46.423
Fucksake!

37:02.167 --> 37:03.702
What the fuck?

37:05.751 --> 37:06.934
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

37:15.317 --> 37:17.877
Fucking Yanks.
Always got to blow shit up.

37:19.990 --> 37:21.238
Paul?

37:22.933 --> 37:24.755
You and Janusz wait here
for the police,

37:24.757 --> 37:26.932
fire service, to show up.
Handle it.

37:26.934 --> 37:28.083
Roger that.

37:28.085 --> 37:29.525
Let's go.

37:47.764 --> 37:49.684
Jackie, Jackie, Jackie.

37:51.028 --> 37:53.492
Should of taken the out,
my friend.

38:02.259 --> 38:04.434
All right,
I've got their phone.

38:04.436 --> 38:05.747
They're headed East.

38:11.795 --> 38:13.810
Your boyfriend took the bait.

38:17.331 --> 38:18.452
You're welcome.

38:34.163 --> 38:36.016
Deighton's on his way.

38:36.018 --> 38:37.490
Where's the kill zone?

38:39.537 --> 38:41.008
A disused factory.

38:41.010 --> 38:42.928
My guys will rendezvous
with you there.

38:42.930 --> 38:44.722
Sending location now.

38:50.193 --> 38:52.336
There are two
ways into the factory.

38:52.338 --> 38:55.855
Here and here.

38:55.857 --> 38:58.384
Once Deighton's inside,
Leigh will paint the target

38:58.386 --> 39:01.967
and we'll pull him into the
ambush, here for the extract.

39:01.969 --> 39:05.455
Better hope her guys
are up to the task.

39:05.457 --> 39:08.463
We have to separate Deighton
to extract him.

39:08.465 --> 39:10.352
He's going to be
throwing bodies at this.

39:34.319 --> 39:37.069
They're leading us to
a disused factory, D.

39:37.071 --> 39:38.414
Oh, how lovely.

39:38.416 --> 39:41.454
Got to love a CIA kill site.

39:41.456 --> 39:43.374
Guess they're serious
about dying.

39:43.376 --> 39:45.647
So, call in
the reinforcements.

39:47.183 --> 39:49.167
Night vision coming online.

40:02.223 --> 40:03.439
What the hell?

40:26.988 --> 40:29.356
We're not going
to need tracking devices.

40:29.358 --> 40:32.171
So, what's the plan?

40:32.173 --> 40:33.962
The plan?

40:33.964 --> 40:38.442
The plan is for you to
shut the fuck up and listen.

40:38.444 --> 40:40.715
That's the fucking plan.

40:40.717 --> 40:42.506
So keep your shit wired tight.

40:42.508 --> 40:45.260
We're expecting
multiple hostiles.

41:14.156 --> 41:15.305
On three.

41:15.307 --> 41:17.258
One, two, three.

41:18.411 --> 41:19.817
Keep your spacing.

41:19.819 --> 41:21.835
Kill anything that moves.

41:24.779 --> 41:26.762
I'm seeing seven tangos.

41:27.691 --> 41:30.890
Be advised, target is painted.

41:30.892 --> 41:32.202
Heading North.

42:16.969 --> 42:18.598
Shit.

42:18.600 --> 42:19.849
No. Come on.

42:24.264 --> 42:26.246
- Draw them to the ambush.
- Roger that.

42:26.248 --> 42:28.199
Remember, we have
to separate Deighton.

42:31.016 --> 42:33.767
Target is 50 meters
to the ambush.

42:49.351 --> 42:51.237
You two guys keep
your shit together.

42:51.239 --> 42:53.989
<i>Don't engage Deighton until
he's out of the kill zone.</i>

42:53.991 --> 42:55.975
<i>We need him separated
from his men.</i>

43:12.998 --> 43:16.068
- Fuck! Be advised I have lost visual.
- Fuck, do it!

43:16.070 --> 43:17.350
<i>I have lost visual.</i>

43:22.758 --> 43:24.454
<i>The fuck are you doing?</i>

43:28.549 --> 43:29.765
Go.

43:38.597 --> 43:40.389
You son of a bitch.

43:56.227 --> 43:58.564
On me. Move!

44:02.661 --> 44:04.163
Extract! Move!

44:05.827 --> 44:07.875
Move, motherfucker! Move!

44:35.618 --> 44:37.410
Come on, let's go!

44:42.497 --> 44:45.664
Why the fuck did you
let Deighton get away?

44:45.666 --> 44:47.680
We had him.

44:50.081 --> 44:53.344
You had a job to do.
You should've done it.

44:53.346 --> 44:54.463
You should have left me.

44:54.465 --> 44:55.937
Trust me,
I thought about it.

44:57.730 --> 44:59.010
Fuck!

45:01.761 --> 45:03.298
On me.

45:27.841 --> 45:29.630
Where the fuck is the car?

45:29.632 --> 45:31.263
Come on, let's go.

45:39.871 --> 45:41.149
You're lucky your vest
took that shot.

45:41.151 --> 45:43.008
Yeah,
I feel fucking lucky.

45:47.583 --> 45:48.830
Yeah, wait, wait, wait.

45:49.759 --> 45:51.103
There's no sign of them, D.

45:54.688 --> 45:56.797
All right,
get back to McKnight.

45:56.799 --> 45:58.143
Roger that.

46:34.269 --> 46:37.212
Keith. Talk to me.
Give me a sitrep.

46:37.214 --> 46:39.482
Oh, Keith can't come
to the phone right now

46:39.484 --> 46:41.402
on account of him being dead.

46:41.404 --> 46:43.675
KIA.
This other fella here, too.

46:43.677 --> 46:48.026
Collins and Samuelson
are next, Leigh.

46:48.028 --> 46:50.236
<i>You know who this is?</i>

46:53.533 --> 46:55.450
You're compromised,
Deighton.

46:55.452 --> 46:57.340
Oh, is that right?

46:59.004 --> 47:02.810
But maybe there's an
opportunity in your compromise.

47:02.812 --> 47:04.441
<i>Do you get what I'm saying?</i>

47:04.443 --> 47:06.524
Why don't you enlighten me,
sweetheart?

47:08.284 --> 47:10.425
Men can be replaced.

47:10.427 --> 47:12.602
<i>Opportunities cannot.</i>

47:12.604 --> 47:15.803
This opportunity, is it
mutually beneficial?

47:18.523 --> 47:20.122
Why don't we find out.

47:45.178 --> 47:46.360
The fuck is wrong with you?

47:46.362 --> 47:48.059
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

48:15.161 --> 48:16.727
You all right, man?

48:16.729 --> 48:19.481
Yeah, I'm alright.
I don't look alright to you?

48:23.160 --> 48:25.241
Not the first bullet
I've taken.

48:30.136 --> 48:32.023
Anyway, thanks.

48:37.559 --> 48:38.968
Come on,
don't leave me hanging.

48:40.536 --> 48:42.231
Come on.

48:48.663 --> 48:50.102
I lost focus back there.

48:50.104 --> 48:51.991
That's not like me.

48:55.062 --> 48:56.948
Two million ain't enough
for this bullshit.

48:56.950 --> 48:58.967
I'll tell you that
right now.

49:00.919 --> 49:02.358
Fuck it.

49:03.958 --> 49:05.876
Two cars are stationary.

49:05.878 --> 49:07.670
And one is moving
towards the river.

49:10.647 --> 49:12.020
Son of a bitch.

49:12.022 --> 49:14.262
McKnight's holed up
on a goddamn boat.

49:16.470 --> 49:19.221
Call Leigh again.
We need a re-up ASAP.

49:40.373 --> 49:42.835
Hm.

49:42.837 --> 49:44.756
You were expecting
someone older.

49:45.812 --> 49:47.093
Most men do.

49:50.132 --> 49:51.508
I'm not most men.

49:53.844 --> 49:55.765
Where the fuck is she?

49:58.613 --> 49:59.987
What do you think?

50:00.756 --> 50:02.354
We have a shot,

50:02.356 --> 50:04.244
if we jack the boat before
Deighton shows up.

50:07.156 --> 50:08.883
Let's get on it then.

50:16.083 --> 50:17.908
Collins is finished.

50:18.964 --> 50:20.628
We both know it.

50:22.130 --> 50:25.009
If you want McKnight
as much as I think you do,

50:25.011 --> 50:26.515
I'm your only option.

50:28.211 --> 50:30.513
You know...

50:30.515 --> 50:32.273
aiding a tier-one terrorist

50:32.275 --> 50:35.219
automatically puts you on
the list right beside them.

50:37.107 --> 50:39.120
But, be that as it may,

50:39.122 --> 50:40.848
you were smart to call me,

50:40.850 --> 50:43.346
because I can keep
you off that list.

50:45.330 --> 50:49.104
So why don't you help me
decide if we can work together.

50:49.106 --> 50:51.154
What is McKnight buying
from the Russians?

50:52.274 --> 50:54.767
What's the bounty on him?

50:54.769 --> 50:56.593
Let's start with
a million dollars.

50:58.193 --> 50:59.792
Warhead for a tactical nuke.

50:59.794 --> 51:01.585
But that's not why
you're here.

51:06.353 --> 51:08.337
You had this
all planned out.

51:10.705 --> 51:14.447
Right from the start.
My God...

51:14.449 --> 51:16.848
You figured you could make
money from both sides,

51:17.937 --> 51:19.311
be a hero for
killing McKnight,

51:19.313 --> 51:21.777
and be in line for
future CIA contracts.

51:23.281 --> 51:25.680
Who's to say if you're
actually helping him.

51:27.153 --> 51:29.613
You want revenge for daddy?

51:29.615 --> 51:32.910
Then I am it, sweetheart,
because...

51:32.912 --> 51:34.670
I understand.

51:34.672 --> 51:36.622
I understand,
it's-it's fucking,

51:36.624 --> 51:39.406
it's cold-blooded
what he did.

51:39.408 --> 51:42.831
Hmm? I can imagine
what that's like.

51:44.176 --> 51:46.093
McKnight beheaded my father

51:46.095 --> 51:47.983
and emailed me the video.

51:49.743 --> 51:52.911
You cannot even begin
to imagine what that's like.

51:55.503 --> 51:57.517
And the CIA sanctioned this?

51:57.519 --> 51:58.829
Get me McKnight
and the warhead

51:58.831 --> 52:01.007
and I'll triple
whatever he's paying you.

52:03.247 --> 52:05.838
Call off your attack dogs,
you've got a deal.

52:08.717 --> 52:11.244
Collins and Samuelson...

52:11.246 --> 52:13.196
are your problem.

52:13.198 --> 52:14.733
Then where are they?

52:18.381 --> 52:21.294
You gotta figure there's three
guys from Deighton's group inside.

52:24.237 --> 52:25.611
At least three.

52:25.613 --> 52:28.301
Plus two or three of
McKnight's bodyguards.

52:29.230 --> 52:31.818
Dude,
this is gonna be brutal.

52:31.820 --> 52:33.580
A lot of ground to cover.

52:53.132 --> 52:54.892
Where the fuck is Leigh?

52:57.869 --> 52:58.922
Weapons check.

52:58.924 --> 53:00.842
I got four for the Shorty.

53:00.844 --> 53:02.698
Five for the Glock.

53:02.700 --> 53:04.393
Could be worse.

53:04.395 --> 53:06.540
I have five for the Shorty
and five for the Glock.

53:08.332 --> 53:09.516
Sure you wanna do this?

53:12.428 --> 53:15.049
It's gonna be
a righteous kill.

53:15.051 --> 53:16.169
Amen.

53:16.171 --> 53:19.274
Don't. Hey. Don't.
Don't mock God.

53:19.276 --> 53:21.068
She doesn't like that.

53:22.763 --> 53:24.619
Let's go shoot
this fucking guy.

54:40.616 --> 54:42.504
Argh!

54:51.592 --> 54:53.702
How many others on the boat?

54:54.855 --> 54:57.253
It's just us.

54:57.255 --> 54:58.823
Where's McKnight?

55:00.839 --> 55:04.356
Where is McKnight?

55:04.358 --> 55:06.564
Deighton knows you're here.

55:06.566 --> 55:08.388
How?

55:08.390 --> 55:10.628
I don't know. Please,
I swear to God I don't...

55:12.743 --> 55:14.535
Let's get the fuck
out of here, right now.

55:22.982 --> 55:24.100
Contact!

55:29.894 --> 55:31.141
Move!

55:38.245 --> 55:39.845
Move!

55:53.445 --> 55:55.266
We gotta get the fuck
outta here. Extract.

55:55.268 --> 55:58.178
The car! The car!

55:58.180 --> 55:59.940
Mag change.

56:01.955 --> 56:04.036
Move! Move!

56:07.395 --> 56:08.900
Mag change!

56:16.995 --> 56:18.531
Move!

56:32.099 --> 56:33.538
The container.

56:55.458 --> 56:56.865
Move!

56:58.817 --> 57:02.050
The car! The car!
Take the fucking car!

57:12.705 --> 57:14.049
Samuelson, move!

57:41.152 --> 57:42.366
Whoo-hoo!

57:42.368 --> 57:45.791
Come on, you fucking
Delta pussy!

57:46.976 --> 57:49.694
Stop hiding,
you fucking coward!

57:49.696 --> 57:51.327
Come on!

57:52.671 --> 57:54.175
Fuck it.

58:01.439 --> 58:03.423
Samuelson, what the fuck
are you doing?

58:17.310 --> 58:19.323
You should've counted
your rounds.

58:19.325 --> 58:21.533
Never did rate
you Delta twats.

58:21.535 --> 58:23.165
I got this, Logan!

58:24.094 --> 58:25.566
Right, drop the pistol.

58:26.622 --> 58:28.987
Drop the pistol.
Drop the long.

58:28.989 --> 58:30.973
Drop the fucking pistol.
Drop it.

58:34.173 --> 58:35.517
Drop the long.

58:42.397 --> 58:44.218
Good. Now...

58:44.220 --> 58:46.106
Let's say we settle this
the old-fashioned way.

58:46.108 --> 58:47.421
Huh?

58:54.876 --> 58:56.285
Come on.

58:58.332 --> 59:01.116
You hold that knife
like a bitch.

59:38.075 --> 59:40.154
Send Brennan my regards.

59:49.146 --> 59:51.512
Samuelson's dead.

59:51.514 --> 59:53.689
Lights out.

59:53.691 --> 59:55.193
Collins?

59:56.185 --> 59:59.032
<i>Hear me, mate? He's dead.</i>

59:59.034 --> 01:00:00.313
Just you now.

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:02.905
<i>Just you.</i>

01:00:12.249 --> 01:00:14.679
Deighton! He's here!

01:00:14.681 --> 01:00:16.409
Deighton, he's over here!

01:01:06.487 --> 01:01:08.628
How about you tell me what the
fuck is going on, Deighton?

01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:11.060
They got lucky. It won't happen again.
You got nothing to worry about.

01:01:11.062 --> 01:01:12.693
They got
fucking lucky?

01:01:12.695 --> 01:01:14.068
Is that what I'm gonna
tell the Russians?

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:16.533
"They got fucking lucky!"

01:01:16.535 --> 01:01:18.996
I warned you those
SEALs were good!

01:01:18.998 --> 01:01:20.308
One left, Terry.

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:22.100
One left and he's a fucking...

01:01:22.102 --> 01:01:23.731
The exchange is blown,

01:01:23.733 --> 01:01:24.949
and so is my out!

01:01:26.966 --> 01:01:30.549
The Russians will not tolerate
last minute changes.

01:01:31.925 --> 01:01:33.364
Neither will my buyers.

01:01:33.366 --> 01:01:35.188
How the fuck
did they find me?

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:37.652
Calm down. I'll get you
a new exchange

01:01:37.654 --> 01:01:39.123
and an out, right.

01:01:39.125 --> 01:01:41.044
Your jihadis still
get their warhead.

01:01:41.046 --> 01:01:44.243
You know why you'll always
remain second-tier, Deighton?

01:01:44.245 --> 01:01:47.252
- Prejudice.
- Oh.

01:01:47.254 --> 01:01:49.107
Small-minded prejudice.

01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:51.764
My buyers are not jihadis.

01:01:51.766 --> 01:01:55.283
Empires are destroyed
from within.

01:01:55.285 --> 01:01:59.060
I am merely accelerating
the process.

01:02:00.052 --> 01:02:01.522
All right.

01:02:01.524 --> 01:02:03.250
Don't make you any less
dangerous to be around,

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:06.034
but, like I said, you've got
nothing to worry about.

01:02:06.036 --> 01:02:07.346
All right?

01:02:07.348 --> 01:02:08.945
I'll handle it.

01:02:08.947 --> 01:02:11.475
I will handle it, Terry.

01:02:12.499 --> 01:02:13.844
Yeah, you do that.

01:02:18.259 --> 01:02:21.203
This is Janusz and Paul.
They'll take care of you.

01:02:22.547 --> 01:02:24.306
Janusz and Paul?

01:02:26.291 --> 01:02:28.369
Fuck.

01:02:28.371 --> 01:02:29.873
TJD Security.

01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:32.594
The best protection
money can buy.

01:02:33.747 --> 01:02:34.866
Deighton.

01:02:35.954 --> 01:02:37.844
Once you've dealt
with Collins,

01:02:39.058 --> 01:02:40.691
take out Leigh.

01:02:41.715 --> 01:02:42.835
Maybe...

01:02:44.147 --> 01:02:46.608
I'll double what
I'm paying you.

01:02:46.610 --> 01:02:50.033
Tell you what. As a gesture of
good faith, I'll do it for free.

01:04:16.303 --> 01:04:18.190
Let me know when
you guys are ready.

01:04:24.399 --> 01:04:25.548
Samuelson's dead.

01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:26.988
What happened?

01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:28.940
We tracked McKnight
to the river.

01:04:28.942 --> 01:04:30.827
He was holed up on a boat.

01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:32.747
It was an ambush.

01:04:32.749 --> 01:04:35.148
Somehow Deighton
knew we were coming.

01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:38.091
McKnight was long gone.

01:04:38.093 --> 01:04:39.598
What happened to you?

01:04:42.669 --> 01:04:43.916
My guy, Keith,

01:04:43.918 --> 01:04:45.482
despite that cluster-fuck
at the factory,

01:04:45.484 --> 01:04:47.467
somehow managed to survive.

01:04:47.469 --> 01:04:50.957
He was alive long enough for Deighton
to extract everything he needed.

01:04:52.205 --> 01:04:53.866
Then Deighton breached
the safe house.

01:04:53.868 --> 01:04:55.660
I had to ditch all our coms.

01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.221
Can you finish?

01:05:00.844 --> 01:05:02.090
Yeah, I can finish,

01:05:02.092 --> 01:05:03.757
and then I'm done.

01:05:05.004 --> 01:05:06.346
Look. If you quit,

01:05:06.348 --> 01:05:08.457
this war,
it won't just end.

01:05:08.459 --> 01:05:10.377
OK?

01:05:10.379 --> 01:05:12.043
You have an obligation.

01:05:13.164 --> 01:05:14.540
I thought you were committed.

01:05:16.172 --> 01:05:17.386
Who'll protect the homeland?

01:05:17.388 --> 01:05:19.370
Are we protecting
the homeland?

01:05:19.372 --> 01:05:21.035
Or are we just
making more enemies?

01:05:24.779 --> 01:05:27.657
McKnight is a bad guy.

01:05:27.659 --> 01:05:30.698
And that bad guy is buying
a warhead for a tactical nuke.

01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:37.577
This comes straight
from Langley.

01:05:37.579 --> 01:05:39.240
After that McKnight is gone,

01:05:39.242 --> 01:05:42.346
and his threat
becomes a reality.

01:05:43.818 --> 01:05:45.259
Are we gonna take him out?

01:05:46.665 --> 01:05:47.786
Most people...

01:05:49.067 --> 01:05:50.760
they don't realize
the level of violence

01:05:50.762 --> 01:05:52.298
that we're capable of.

01:06:03.337 --> 01:06:04.778
Excuse me?

01:06:17.866 --> 01:06:20.681
I once slit the throats
of four Afghans.

01:06:23.273 --> 01:06:25.608
There was fierce fighting
in this mountain region.

01:06:26.632 --> 01:06:28.233
We found them in a cave.

01:06:29.288 --> 01:06:31.910
Three old men
and one young kid.

01:06:31.912 --> 01:06:33.927
They were unarmed.

01:06:33.929 --> 01:06:38.886
Farmers... who'd got
caught up in the fighting.

01:06:38.888 --> 01:06:41.254
Pretty sure they were taking
turns fucking this kid.

01:06:41.256 --> 01:06:42.758
Collins...

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.127
I told them if they cooperated,
we'd treat them humanely.

01:06:46.183 --> 01:06:47.973
So they did.

01:06:47.975 --> 01:06:49.255
They were scared.

01:06:50.983 --> 01:06:52.486
We were cut-off from our unit,

01:06:52.488 --> 01:06:54.151
so they agreed to lead us out.

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:56.676
Neither of us had a choice.

01:06:56.678 --> 01:06:58.119
We needed out.

01:07:00.903 --> 01:07:03.460
They didn't want the Taliban
to see them helping us.

01:07:03.462 --> 01:07:04.839
For obvious reasons.

01:07:06.951 --> 01:07:10.247
But they were afraid that we'd kill
them once they'd led us to safety.

01:07:11.238 --> 01:07:12.550
We promised we wouldn't.

01:07:15.398 --> 01:07:17.926
Once we'd cleared the danger,
I slit their throats.

01:07:20.007 --> 01:07:21.605
I did the kid first.

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:24.998
He looks at me.

01:07:27.334 --> 01:07:28.838
He can't believe it.

01:07:29.958 --> 01:07:31.397
I promised him.

01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:34.694
Now I'm betraying him.

01:07:36.261 --> 01:07:38.054
And all I can say is,
"Sorry, kid.

01:07:39.494 --> 01:07:40.869
It's my nature."

01:07:43.110 --> 01:07:45.222
You had no way to verify
if they were Taliban.

01:07:46.885 --> 01:07:49.443
You saved lives.

01:07:49.445 --> 01:07:52.354
You did what you
were supposed to do.

01:07:52.356 --> 01:07:54.821
It's not a betrayal if
there's a greater objective.

01:07:57.124 --> 01:07:59.330
Deighton was right.

01:07:59.332 --> 01:08:01.986
- I have given enough to the cause...
- Look.

01:08:01.988 --> 01:08:04.226
The President gave us
the green light.

01:08:04.228 --> 01:08:07.074
Now either we execute, or a lot
of people are gonna get killed

01:08:07.076 --> 01:08:08.739
who don't need to get killed.

01:08:14.628 --> 01:08:16.291
Then let's finish this.

01:08:35.491 --> 01:08:36.448
OK.

01:08:36.451 --> 01:08:37.952
What do you guys need?

01:08:37.953 --> 01:08:40.899
I want you to hack
TJD Security's servers.

01:08:57.250 --> 01:08:59.551
OK, so...

01:08:59.553 --> 01:09:01.153
all of their registered
domains are down.

01:09:01.154 --> 01:09:03.712
I'm not gonna get
anything here.

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:10.591
What about Deighton's wife,
his kids, his dog?

01:09:10.593 --> 01:09:12.639
We're not touching
the guy's family.

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.006
They're civilians.

01:09:15.009 --> 01:09:17.153
You wanna go home
to your family?

01:09:18.209 --> 01:09:19.328
Find me Deighton's.

01:09:21.569 --> 01:09:25.151
If we do this,
we do it my way.

01:09:25.153 --> 01:09:26.496
Understood?

01:09:31.392 --> 01:09:32.734
Search Lisa Deighton.

01:09:32.737 --> 01:09:36.192
Lisa Deighton.

01:09:40.831 --> 01:09:42.719
Take me to the hotel.

01:10:00.223 --> 01:10:03.549
All right. She's got a phone, and
that phone's got a location.

01:10:03.551 --> 01:10:06.111
She's at a pub
on Longcroft Road.

01:10:07.358 --> 01:10:09.628
The George and Dragon.

01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:10.879
Gear?

01:10:12.127 --> 01:10:13.758
There's a car outside.

01:10:16.031 --> 01:10:17.886
All right.
This is what I want you to do.

01:10:33.597 --> 01:10:34.686
Fuck.

01:10:40.861 --> 01:10:42.397
Right, we've got him.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.691
Let's go get paid.

01:11:04.764 --> 01:11:07.322
Get set.

01:11:07.324 --> 01:11:08.444
Roger that.

01:11:35.963 --> 01:11:37.112
How we doing?

01:11:37.114 --> 01:11:39.000
All quiet on
the Western front, boss.

01:11:39.002 --> 01:11:41.721
That's what they said
the night before 9/11.

01:11:41.723 --> 01:11:43.160
It ain't over till it's over.

01:11:43.162 --> 01:11:45.146
Stay alert. Take five.
I got this.

01:12:00.602 --> 01:12:02.234
Take him down.

01:13:15.862 --> 01:13:17.046
Fuck.

01:13:37.493 --> 01:13:39.350
Take me to the warehouse.

01:13:40.469 --> 01:13:42.738
- Let's go!
- Just fucking shoot me!

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:43.989
You got a family.

01:13:58.389 --> 01:14:01.042
- Deighton?
- Collins is being put down as we speak.

01:14:01.044 --> 01:14:03.794
<i>I'm on my way to the warehouse
to kill McKnight</i>

01:14:03.796 --> 01:14:05.491
<i>and get your warhead.</i>

01:14:05.493 --> 01:14:07.156
Get my money ready.

01:14:08.308 --> 01:14:09.587
I'll see you there.

01:15:47.791 --> 01:15:49.423
Bastard.

01:15:51.472 --> 01:15:52.944
Fucking bastard.

01:15:56.238 --> 01:15:57.709
So...

01:15:57.711 --> 01:15:59.919
How much is Leigh
paying Deighton?

01:16:01.903 --> 01:16:03.087
How much?

01:16:04.367 --> 01:16:08.620
If I knew that, I'd be
running the fucking show.

01:16:09.839 --> 01:16:13.006
Deighton's gonna fuckin'
tear you apart.

01:16:14.446 --> 01:16:16.719
Man, all I wanna do
is go home.

01:16:27.118 --> 01:16:28.399
We're inside.

01:16:50.509 --> 01:16:52.076
What happened?

01:16:56.045 --> 01:16:57.323
Collins?

01:16:57.325 --> 01:16:58.828
Did you get him?

01:17:19.052 --> 01:17:20.268
Hello, Leigh.

01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:24.009
<i>Long time no speak.</i>

01:17:24.011 --> 01:17:27.722
<i>I want Deighton
to hear this, too.</i>

01:17:27.724 --> 01:17:29.707
You're gonna die tired,
you son of a bitch.

01:17:32.555 --> 01:17:34.409
<i>Deighton?</i>

01:17:34.411 --> 01:17:36.105
Yeah, I'm here, Terry.

01:17:36.107 --> 01:17:39.369
<i>You two are gonna
make a beautiful couple.</i>

01:17:41.259 --> 01:17:43.723
<i>You made the wrong play,
my friend.</i>

01:17:44.843 --> 01:17:46.763
You got greedy.

01:17:48.203 --> 01:17:49.832
<i>What do you think
is gonna happen</i>

01:17:49.834 --> 01:17:51.817
<i>when Leigh goes
before her bosses and</i>

01:17:51.819 --> 01:17:55.305
explains how she failed
to eliminate me

01:17:55.307 --> 01:17:58.056
<i>after they foolishly sanctioned
her personal vendetta?</i>

01:17:58.058 --> 01:18:00.423
<i>She'll throw you under
a bus before she pays you,</i>

01:18:00.425 --> 01:18:02.312
<i>so why don't you do</i>

01:18:02.314 --> 01:18:04.392
<i>what you so kindly
offered to do before</i>

01:18:04.394 --> 01:18:06.760
<i>and pop the bitch.</i>

01:18:06.762 --> 01:18:09.098
It's the only way
you're gonna get out of this.

01:18:12.138 --> 01:18:14.345
<i>So long, Deighton.</i>

01:18:20.265 --> 01:18:23.974
Think it through
before you make a move.

01:18:23.976 --> 01:18:25.992
We can still take him.
There's still time.

01:18:35.145 --> 01:18:36.741
Get me McKnight's exfil.

01:18:36.743 --> 01:18:37.734
Right now.

01:18:37.736 --> 01:18:40.710
Uh-huh. Understood.

01:18:40.712 --> 01:18:42.312
I'll call you back.

01:18:47.271 --> 01:18:51.013
Now you are going to tell me
how McKnight is going to exfil.

01:18:51.015 --> 01:18:54.118
- Understood?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:57.029
Then you find yourself in a very
unfortunate position, my friend.

01:18:57.031 --> 01:18:59.780
Wait... Wait, wait!
I can find him!

01:18:59.782 --> 01:19:00.966
I can find him, OK?

01:19:00.968 --> 01:19:02.535
So find him.

01:19:31.142 --> 01:19:33.123
- Deighton, listen to me. We can still...
- Shut up.

01:19:36.102 --> 01:19:37.989
Talk to me.

01:19:38.981 --> 01:19:40.803
All right. Good work.

01:19:40.805 --> 01:19:41.893
Ethan.

01:19:43.333 --> 01:19:44.963
Drop the gun.

01:19:44.965 --> 01:19:46.627
Do it now!

01:19:48.838 --> 01:19:50.468
That's it. Drop the gun.

01:19:51.813 --> 01:19:53.443
Good boy.

01:19:53.445 --> 01:19:57.475
See, that is why
you never trust a woman.

01:19:57.477 --> 01:19:58.693
It's all right, sweetheart. I have
twice the motivation to drop McKnight.

01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:06.082
He's headed for
Gridstone Airfield. Let's go.

01:20:06.084 --> 01:20:07.906
Deighton, I'm sorry.

01:20:07.908 --> 01:20:10.083
- Drop your fucking weapon.
- You fucking drop it!

01:20:10.085 --> 01:20:11.875
Drop your fucking weapon!
Drop it!

01:20:11.877 --> 01:20:13.507
Deighton, wait, no...

01:21:09.249 --> 01:21:10.689
Lights out.

01:21:42.304 --> 01:21:43.647
Jack.

01:21:44.993 --> 01:21:48.511
- Collins.
- Don't... say a fucking word.

01:22:06.847 --> 01:22:07.900
Where's the plane?

01:22:07.902 --> 01:22:09.758
It's coming. 20 minutes.

01:22:10.879 --> 01:22:13.021
Best I could do
for short notice.

01:22:13.023 --> 01:22:14.460
Goddammit.

01:22:14.462 --> 01:22:15.934
Can wait in there.

01:22:17.406 --> 01:22:19.550
All right.
Let's go. Come on.

01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:35.966
We're taking
McKnight's plane home.

01:22:37.757 --> 01:22:39.389
Let your people know.

01:22:41.661 --> 01:22:43.548
The money, I...

01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:45.309
I don't want
your fucking money.

01:22:47.197 --> 01:22:48.861
Do you know
why I'm doing this?

01:22:49.917 --> 01:22:52.157
- McKnight...
- Wait for my call.

01:24:21.305 --> 01:24:22.905
He's here!

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:41.333
Jesus Christ.

01:24:41.335 --> 01:24:43.350
Go!

01:24:43.352 --> 01:24:45.112
Go! Go!

01:25:01.112 --> 01:25:02.423
Cover me!

01:25:10.743 --> 01:25:13.527
The fuck you waiting for?
Go!

01:25:15.126 --> 01:25:17.173
- Can you see him?
- He's out there, keep looking.

01:25:17.175 --> 01:25:18.262
Where the fuck is he, huh?

01:26:16.339 --> 01:26:17.621
Son of a bitch.

01:26:34.546 --> 01:26:35.955
Argh!

01:26:59.890 --> 01:27:01.329
McKnight!

01:27:47.953 --> 01:27:49.520
Jack.

01:27:50.864 --> 01:27:52.784
Did you get him?

01:28:37.389 --> 01:28:39.277
All right, let's go.
