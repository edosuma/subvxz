04:10.517 --> 04:11.916
Yo, dawg.

04:12.352 --> 04:13.649
Konnichiwa.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.009
What?

04:15.122 --> 04:18.091
Konnichiwa.
Konnichiwa means, "What's up?"

04:18.658 --> 04:21.320
- So what the fuck's up?
- We know what it means.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.620
Hey, you want a smoke?

04:24.431 --> 04:25.864
You can read the paper through this,
it's so clean.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.662
A couple of hits,
you'll be fucking like beasts.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.300
- You boys like pussy, right?
- Hey!

04:32.539 --> 04:34.905
Do we look like fucking tweakers to you?

04:36.309 --> 04:39.176
- So you got the shit or not?
- Yeah. You?

04:47.988 --> 04:50.047
What the fuck is this?
We said a machine gun.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.591
It is a machine gun.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.485
The kind you can carry.

04:54.694 --> 04:56.457
Couldn't get none of those.

04:56.663 --> 04:59.154
This baby's got character.
Korean War vintage.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.325
Maybe even mowed down
one of your grandpapa-sans

05:01.434 --> 05:03.265
when he was charging the wire at Inch'on.

05:03.370 --> 05:05.634
This is bullshit. It's fucking stuck.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.104
Fuck it, take the ride.
Three large. VIN's clean.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.199
Nigga, I drive a $100,000 car!

05:10.310 --> 05:12.835
We want your faggoty-ass ride,
we'll jack it from you.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.171
Cool. Don't decide right now.

05:15.282 --> 05:18.740
Konnichiwa is Japanese.
It's insulting to Koreans.

05:19.085 --> 05:20.575
How am I supposed to tell if you can't?

05:20.687 --> 05:23.121
What the fuck is that supposed to mean,
white boy?

05:23.223 --> 05:27.284
It means you got eyes like apostrophes,
you dress white, talk black and drive Jew.

05:27.394 --> 05:29.362
So, how am I supposed to know what kind
of zipperhead,

05:29.462 --> 05:32.124
dog-munching dink you are if you don't?

05:32.232 --> 05:33.358
Yo.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.666
Do you know who the fuck we are?

05:35.769 --> 05:36.895
Yeah.

05:37.370 --> 05:40.498
You're a couple of panheads
buying a machine gun out of a trunk.

05:42.409 --> 05:44.468
Wassup, you son of a bitch?

05:49.616 --> 05:51.880
- Pick him up.
- Get your ass up.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.847
I'm getting the shit out of here.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.082
Give me the keys!

06:00.594 --> 06:03.028
- Konnichiwa, bitch.
- Let's go!

06:38.999 --> 06:40.296
Where?

09:54.761 --> 09:55.785
It's okay.

09:56.796 --> 09:57.854
I'm a cop.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.019
Captain Wander, congratulations
on breaking the case.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.454
Can you tell me how you found the twins?

10:24.557 --> 10:27.583
Julie, my people had turned the city
upside down looking for these girls.

10:27.694 --> 10:29.753
I could not be prouder of my men.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.857
Ma'am, excuse me.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.796
How can you shoot a guy taking a dump?

10:35.535 --> 10:38.333
I mean, seriously. That... That's sacred.
That's like shooting a man in church.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.496
Or a Dodger game.

10:39.606 --> 10:42.473
Hey, whatever it takes to be a hero.
Anytime, anyplace, right, Lud?

10:42.575 --> 10:43.542
It gets old.

10:43.643 --> 10:43.843
I hate these short-eyed,
kiddie-raping bastards.

10:43.843 --> 10:45.936
I hate these short-eyed,
kiddie-raping bastards.

10:46.045 --> 10:48.013
At least kidnap some full-grown ladies
with shapes.

10:48.114 --> 10:50.947
Wow. Maybe you should check his closet
next, huh, Lud?

10:51.050 --> 10:53.610
The girls are being examined
by a physician right now.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.348
Both twins are in good health

10:56.456 --> 10:58.686
and will be reunited
with their family shortly.

10:58.791 --> 11:01.351
LA Times front page tomorrow
is gonna say,

11:01.461 --> 11:04.828
"Vice Detective Rescues Missing Twins."

11:05.665 --> 11:07.792
Detective. Singular.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.063
Yeah. Like we've been sitting around
on our ass

11:10.170 --> 11:11.501
doing jack-shit in our unit the last month.

11:11.604 --> 11:14.505
Hey! You two cut the shit.
The boss is on his way right now.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.040
I mean, you could have saved some for us.

11:16.142 --> 11:17.837
- I did you a solid, Santos.
- You did me a solid?

11:17.944 --> 11:20.139
You want to see their faces every night?
You want to be a killer?

11:20.246 --> 11:21.679
You know what? Shut the fuck up.

11:21.781 --> 11:23.146
Hey, hey, what the hell is going on?

11:23.249 --> 11:25.877
Hey! This is real professional.

11:25.985 --> 11:30.183
What if I walked in here
with the Chief, huh?

11:30.290 --> 11:33.088
Santos, deploy your ass outside.

11:33.193 --> 11:36.287
Find Ted Berman and make sure that
that crime scene log is in order.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.159
- Yes, sir.
- Run along, boy.

11:38.264 --> 11:39.288
Shut the fuck up.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.424
Hey, secure that bullshit,
all right? Both of you.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.765
Clady, you take DeMille back to the barn
and start writing.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.805
I want something to red-pin by midnight.

11:46.906 --> 11:48.703
Tell those body monkeys
to get right in here.

11:48.808 --> 11:51.140
You got it, Cap. Let's go.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.681
This is crazy!

12:04.524 --> 12:06.116
You fucked them up!

12:07.961 --> 12:09.360
This is beautiful.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.054
And that machine gun shit,
that was perfect.

12:12.165 --> 12:15.259
I know you hated waiting,
but it's better this way.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.427
- You all right?
- Yeah. I...

12:19.772 --> 12:21.467
- I got shot.
- Yeah, but you okay?

12:21.574 --> 12:23.337
Yeah, I'm okay, Jack.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.444
'Cause I know you're not tripping
about these...

12:25.545 --> 12:27.570
These assholes right here?

12:28.514 --> 12:30.072
Fuck them. Screw them.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.777
You went toe-to-toe with evil
and you won.

12:34.053 --> 12:35.680
You saved those girls.

12:35.788 --> 12:37.483
This is lovely, Tommy.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.582
Come here. Come here, man.
Give me... Give me a hug!

12:40.693 --> 12:41.990
Come on.

12:43.963 --> 12:45.396
- Ribs are tender.
- What you hiding from?

12:45.498 --> 12:47.966
- Nothing.
- What you hiding from?

12:50.203 --> 12:51.693
You've been drinking.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.537
You know that...
That thing they say about vodka?

12:55.642 --> 12:57.542
How you can't smell it?

12:57.644 --> 13:02.013
It's bullshit. The D.A.'s shooting team
is en route right now.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.515
And you're not ready
for public consumption.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.108
So, come on.
I want to get you to a hospital,

13:07.220 --> 13:09.085
get you away from all those guys.
Come on.

13:09.188 --> 13:11.053
All right. Thanks, Jack.

13:12.659 --> 13:15.093
I think we can do some damage control.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.598
If it ain't LA's deadliest white boy.

13:27.707 --> 13:30.403
Aren't you on the wrong side
of the yellow tape?

13:31.077 --> 13:34.069
Congrats on four more notches
for your gun belt.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.478
I'll be praying for the families
of your victims.

13:36.582 --> 13:39.050
They're called suspects.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.713
The victims are the 14-year-old school
girls the suspects kept in a cage

13:42.822 --> 13:46.189
and sold to chicken hawks
to poke, prod and put on the Internet.

13:46.292 --> 13:47.782
Suspects, Washington.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.326
Suspects.

13:50.730 --> 13:53.858
As evil as those men were,
they had a right to trial.

13:54.367 --> 13:57.495
There's gonna be some blowback
from the Korean community on this one.

13:57.603 --> 14:00.197
Now that you're all militant,
why don't you just say it?

14:00.306 --> 14:01.568
You think I'm a racist.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.938
- You have another explanation?
- No, I don't.

14:04.043 --> 14:07.774
Because if I roll and determine the
suspects are black, yellow or brown,

14:07.880 --> 14:09.814
I'll blow them out of their socks.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.885
But if they're white,
I'll give them a ride home.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.984
You know why? 'Cause I'm a racist.
Fuck you.

14:16.089 --> 14:19.081
Man, I would give my right arm to have
that shit on tape.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.851
What happened to you, Terrence?

14:21.961 --> 14:23.622
We used to be brothers.

14:23.730 --> 14:27.530
Hey, hey, stay on point.
Washington, you stay on point.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.299
Always, Captain Wander. Always.

14:32.438 --> 14:35.407
Tom. Come on, let's get you out of here.

14:39.212 --> 14:42.147
- Don't go near that piece of shit.
- He's got it coming, Jack.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.375
Do not go near him.
You stay away, far away.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.418
- Fuck him.
- That's an order.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.354
I'm waiting for Nurse Garcia.

14:56.929 --> 14:59.557
I did the same thing with this girl once.

15:00.666 --> 15:03.032
She was a waitress at a jazz bar.

15:03.136 --> 15:06.469
And I'd sit in her section,
wouldn't let anybody else serve me.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.040
She'd change sections, I'd change tables.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.878
Persistence. That's the key.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.146
Wait a second.

15:19.152 --> 15:22.952
You're that cop! You're...
I just seen your face on TV.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.422
You rescued those twins
in Koreatown, right?

15:29.195 --> 15:31.254
Are you okay? Did you get shot?

15:31.364 --> 15:32.388
No.

15:32.899 --> 15:34.196
Yeah.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.792
Who the hell are you?

15:36.903 --> 15:40.703
Me? I sell insurance, life, auto, casualty.

15:41.307 --> 15:43.969
Wow, that's some heavy shit, man.

15:44.076 --> 15:47.512
So those guys, they...
They shot first, right?

15:48.548 --> 15:50.106
Excuse me?

15:50.616 --> 15:53.608
Whole city was looking for those kids.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.079
How'd you find them?

15:57.423 --> 15:59.220
That's my job.

16:01.861 --> 16:02.987
Sergeant Green,
Sergeant Green...

16:03.095 --> 16:04.153
Excuse me, Captain.

16:04.263 --> 16:05.662
Sorry to interrupt.

16:05.765 --> 16:08.893
Deputy Chief Sorensen
is trying to raise you on a simplex.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.159
Insurance, Tom.

16:11.270 --> 16:12.897
I sell insurance.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.835
If you ever need any, and you will,

16:18.945 --> 16:20.310
why don't you give me a call?

16:20.413 --> 16:21.971
No one has to know but us.

16:22.081 --> 16:24.379
Not Clady, not Wander, no one.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.483
Listen, for your own good,

16:30.923 --> 16:34.415
don't get yourself so far out there
that I can't reel you back.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.896
See you sometime.

16:44.570 --> 16:45.594
Who was that?

16:45.705 --> 16:49.141
A cop who burns cops. Jesus.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.437
- Who?
- Nobody, Grace.

16:52.044 --> 16:53.739
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:55.781 --> 16:56.748
Oh.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.354
Hold this.

17:03.322 --> 17:05.882
You know, you can just stop by sometime.

17:06.592 --> 17:08.856
You don't have to get shot
when you want to see me.

17:08.961 --> 17:12.396
Why? I like it like this.
Don't you?

17:12.865 --> 17:14.162
No, I don't.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.665
I don't.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.027
No. Don't get close to me.

17:19.137 --> 17:22.300
I work here.
I'm not losing my license for you.

17:22.407 --> 17:24.035
- I'm a cop.
- No.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.146
Whatever.

17:30.149 --> 17:33.482
I kicked the door after identifying
myself as a police officer.

17:33.586 --> 17:38.046
Upon entry, I was fired upon by a suspect
in the living room with a silver automatic.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.591
I returned fire, he goes down.

17:41.027 --> 17:44.463
Then I'm hit in the torso by shotgun fire
from the second suspect.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.553
Point of entry?

17:45.665 --> 17:47.462
Front door on the west side
of the structure.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.535
Why didn't you call for backup?

17:50.136 --> 17:52.263
Exigent circumstances.

17:52.905 --> 17:57.239
I heard screams emanating from the house
and ascertained a crime was in progress.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.404
...saying something.
- Take care, Silk.

18:26.505 --> 18:29.099
- It was great working with you.
- Thanks a lot.

18:29.875 --> 18:30.842
Now it's a party.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.138
Oh, my goodness!
Now it's a binge, Captain.

18:33.245 --> 18:35.770
- What's up, killer?
- Steady.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.711
Steady. Yeah, he's in.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.752
What's with you?
What, Clady give you a happy ending?

18:40.853 --> 18:43.344
Is that any way to address a commander?

18:43.456 --> 18:46.448
I got the call from the Chief this morning.
Badge ceremony's next week.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.493
Congratulations, boss.

18:48.594 --> 18:51.062
Hey. We're gonna have
the keys to the city.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.958
You believe that shit?
They're crowning him king.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.193
Let's get a toast to that.
A toast to the king!

18:56.302 --> 18:58.202
- King Wander!
- King Wander!

18:58.304 --> 19:00.033
Yo, boss.
Can I be your driver when you make chief?

19:00.139 --> 19:02.369
You got it. You got it.
Whatever you want.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.568
You know, I owe you one, Tom.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.373
That Park twins caper,
that gave me the edge.

19:07.480 --> 19:11.041
You know, the Chief, he's breaking
tradition by promoting me here.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.551
The first commander slot always goes
to the head of Internal Affairs.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.621
That's the way it is.

19:15.721 --> 19:16.915
That's because they got so much dirt
on everyone.

19:17.023 --> 19:20.049
That's right, and they're always looking
for more, huh?

19:20.359 --> 19:21.326
Yeah.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.020
You know this prick?

19:25.131 --> 19:28.589
Came at me like Joe Concerned Citizen,
asking procedural questions.

19:28.701 --> 19:31.261
Yeah, yeah, we got a history, this little...

19:32.638 --> 19:34.105
See, if you showed up during the daytime,

19:34.206 --> 19:35.605
you would know who your enemies are.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.175
What'd you tell him?

19:37.376 --> 19:39.105
I couldn't help myself, Clady.
I told him everything.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.178
DeMILLE: Attaboy!

19:40.279 --> 19:42.372
You know, this is a typical Biggs
bullshit move.

19:42.481 --> 19:44.711
This is his M.O.
He'll back-door you every fucking time.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.808
Why is Internal Affairs up my ass
all of a sudden?

19:46.919 --> 19:50.685
It's Washington, brother.
Your ex-partner's been snitching.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.522
Holy shit.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.458
Jack, talk to me.

20:00.833 --> 20:05.634
Washington's had several meetings with
Captain Biggs over the last few weeks.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.069
There are no secrets in the department.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.971
So, when I became cognizant
of the problem,

20:10.076 --> 20:11.065
we threw a tail on him.

20:11.177 --> 20:13.611
I followed this guy Eastside,
Westside, Southside.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.045
Next thing I know,
he's ringing Biggs' doorbell in Upland.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.048
Who's Washington giving up?

20:22.621 --> 20:23.918
You, Tom.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.381
- Me. Why now?
- Yeah.

20:26.492 --> 20:30.519
Because I shitcanned him from the unit
and he's a vindictive bastard.

20:30.629 --> 20:33.723
Now he's on a mission to pull the rug out
from under all my best guys.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.597
All my best guys.
That's what this shit is about.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.700
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:39.805 --> 20:41.204
- Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy!
- Man!

20:41.307 --> 20:42.865
Tommy, hey, that's your life.

20:42.975 --> 20:43.576
- That's your life right there.
- I'm just gonna talk...

20:43.576 --> 20:44.600
- That's your life right there.
- I'm just gonna talk...

20:44.710 --> 20:46.473
- No, you're not. You're not.
- You want to talk?

20:46.579 --> 20:48.706
Let's talk about my foot up your ass if you
don't sit the fuck down

20:48.814 --> 20:50.406
- in that goddamn chair.
- He's all right. Have a seat.

20:50.516 --> 20:52.347
Come on. He's all right.

20:53.652 --> 20:56.018
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

20:58.224 --> 21:02.285
Do not, and I repeat,
do not hand Washington your badge.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.686
I know you two
have done some dirt together.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.831
But we gotta hold the line, you and me.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.670
We've been here before, haven't we?

21:11.771 --> 21:14.205
When the gates of hell opened up
on you, Tom?

21:14.306 --> 21:17.503
And I took care of you then.
I'm gonna take care of you now.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.975
All right?

21:19.078 --> 21:20.705
Okay. Okay.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.881
Washington. Washington.

23:04.783 --> 23:07.308
- Drop it, Tom! Now!
- What the hell are you doing?

23:09.054 --> 23:11.784
- You going to kill me, partner?
- You're crazy! We got a 211 in progress!

23:11.891 --> 23:13.518
I got you, I got you and Wander.

23:13.626 --> 23:14.786
Listen to me, you idiot!

23:14.894 --> 23:17.158
We got two gangbangers rolling in hot!

23:26.272 --> 23:27.239
Shit!

23:57.937 --> 24:00.235
Washington, stay with me, partner.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.420
- Don't move! Let me see your hands!
- I'm a cop.

24:25.531 --> 24:27.499
I'm a cop! I'm a fucking cop!

24:28.033 --> 24:30.627
Fuck. It's Ludlow.

24:30.736 --> 24:32.067
Get me an ambulance. Now.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.638
Holy shit.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.436
He's a cop, too?

24:36.675 --> 24:37.801
Yeah.

25:22.354 --> 25:23.719
Where's the video?

25:47.046 --> 25:49.480
- Who else has seen this shit?
- Just us, boss.

25:49.581 --> 25:51.412
It was a straight 211 that went sideways.

25:51.517 --> 25:53.178
It's not what it was, Lud.
It's what it looks like.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.185
But it's not what it looks like.

25:55.287 --> 25:57.414
- It's not.
- That's all there is, Tom!

25:58.157 --> 26:01.649
What it looks like! What everybody sees!
You knew that!

26:01.760 --> 26:03.489
Lud, anybody in the department
sees this video,

26:03.595 --> 26:04.823
you're no longer a cop,
do you understand that?

26:04.930 --> 26:07.728
The department? The D.A. sees this...

26:08.434 --> 26:10.163
He's... He's going to prison.

26:10.269 --> 26:12.635
Why? Because Washington was in
the wrong place at the wrong time?

26:12.738 --> 26:14.501
No, because you were.

26:14.606 --> 26:17.837
Washington's problems are over,
yours are just beginning.

26:18.944 --> 26:21.378
Try to think two moves ahead for once.

26:21.914 --> 26:25.577
Captain Biggs will say that you got
two thugs off the street

26:25.684 --> 26:29.085
and went after a cop who was diming you
out to Internal Affairs.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.177
It writes itself.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.689
- I was just gonna break his jaw.
- That's a good answer.

26:32.791 --> 26:36.056
I gave you a direct order,
stay away from him.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.098
Give me your goddamn burner now.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.897
Give me your goddamn burner!

26:48.373 --> 26:50.933
We know you don't give a shit about
yourself, Lud. That's pretty obvious.

26:51.043 --> 26:52.101
But you gotta think about the unit.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.645
- You really fucked us on this one.
- Clady.

26:54.746 --> 26:57.146
- Give me a minute, please.
- Yes, sir.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.252
I can't afford to lose you.

27:07.092 --> 27:08.650
Who'd do what you do?

27:10.028 --> 27:12.758
You are the tip of the fucking spear.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.529
Who's gonna hold back the animals?

27:23.976 --> 27:25.273
Maybe

27:27.146 --> 27:28.443
the clerk

27:30.048 --> 27:33.506
forgot to put the disc
in the recorder today.

27:38.023 --> 27:43.017
Maybe you were first on the scene, Tom,
and you rendered aid to Washington.

27:48.133 --> 27:49.600
I'll go outside.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.198
Make some calls.

27:57.743 --> 27:58.937
And maybe,

27:59.912 --> 28:02.210
this won't be here

28:03.182 --> 28:04.649
when I get back.

28:57.603 --> 28:59.867
He was my partner back in the day.

29:01.006 --> 29:04.965
We were black and white in a black
and white when it was still a big deal.

29:05.944 --> 29:09.903
White cops wouldn't back us 'cause of him
and the black cops 'cause of me.

29:10.649 --> 29:11.616
Fuck them.

29:12.050 --> 29:13.517
We made it.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.617
Sorry. You tried to save him.
You did your best.

29:18.857 --> 29:22.156
My best?
I was curled up in a ball while he got shot.

29:22.828 --> 29:24.295
We should have dumped those guys.

29:24.396 --> 29:28.924
How can they just wave a pen
and change what happens just like that?

29:29.034 --> 29:32.026
We're the police.
We can do whatever the hell we want.

29:32.838 --> 29:35.864
Doesn't matter what happens.
It's how we write it up.

29:35.974 --> 29:37.464
What about the truth?

29:38.477 --> 29:39.774
What about it?

29:41.780 --> 29:44.647
You have to honor him, your friend.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.377
"Honor him"?

29:46.485 --> 29:49.454
I was going to knock him out
and he thought I was going to kill him.

29:49.588 --> 29:50.577
Prick.

29:50.689 --> 29:52.486
Don't turn your back on him.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.988
Good can come from bad.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.093
In my world, the real world,

30:01.733 --> 30:04.293
the bad breeds more bad, Grace.

30:12.244 --> 30:17.079
See this? It's done. It's over.
It's taken care of. All right?

30:22.254 --> 30:24.586
I won't give you another dose here,

30:25.157 --> 30:27.250
but got a set of blues in your locker?

30:28.093 --> 30:29.355
- No.
- Here's the thing.

30:29.461 --> 30:30.928
- I gotta bury you.
- Not that.

30:31.029 --> 30:36.023
In a nice, politically correct spot until this
Washington thing settles down a little bit.

30:36.134 --> 30:37.192
No, Jack.

30:37.302 --> 30:37.502
Your job is to conduct
preliminary interviews of the complainant.

30:37.502 --> 30:41.063
Your job is to conduct
preliminary interviews of the complainant.

30:43.175 --> 30:47.043
If there's a specific allegation
against an officer,

30:47.145 --> 30:49.670
write it up, forward it to Internal Affairs.

30:50.282 --> 30:53.877
Now, the temptation is to be
a good brother cop.

30:54.920 --> 30:58.185
Don't be. None of this shit's
going anywhere anyway.

30:59.124 --> 31:00.591
There's your desk.

31:02.728 --> 31:05.196
Suppose I get a complaint against myself?

31:07.432 --> 31:10.230
Write it up and forward it. Okay?

31:11.036 --> 31:12.594
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.411
You have a complaint?

31:24.516 --> 31:27.952
Motherfucker beat my ass like I was
Rodney King, man.

31:28.053 --> 31:29.816
Except there wasn't no video.

31:29.921 --> 31:31.616
Dude looked just like you.

31:32.157 --> 31:33.146
But black.

31:33.258 --> 31:38.093
This ass been working longer than all
y'all cops disrespecting me.

31:38.196 --> 31:41.393
He pulled me out of my ride, homes,
disrespected me in front of my old lady.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.798
Tried to get her number and shit.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.870
You get his badge number
or see his nametag?

31:45.971 --> 31:48.701
Not with his boot on my throat
and his partner kicking me.

31:48.807 --> 31:49.796
No, it was a little bit difficult.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.671
Everybody comes here,
they have a complaint.

31:51.777 --> 31:53.711
They sit down.
I done waited for my fucking five hours

31:53.812 --> 31:55.404
and you gonna ask me,
do I have a complaint?

31:55.514 --> 31:57.414
Obviously, I have a complaint.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.273
You know what? This is some bullshit.

31:59.384 --> 32:00.817
That's why I hate
all these motherfucking cops.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.386
Fuck all y'all!

32:12.564 --> 32:15.032
Wander has got a sense of humor,
I'll give him that.

32:15.133 --> 32:16.623
You have a complaint?

32:17.302 --> 32:18.735
Where to begin?

32:21.373 --> 32:22.772
The black band.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.739
Man down. Hurts, right?

32:26.077 --> 32:28.545
Losing a colleague. Brother in blue.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.775
I'm sorry he's gone, sir.

32:31.850 --> 32:36.412
You two worked Vice Special together.
Pushed a black and white in Southend.

32:36.521 --> 32:38.250
Phonebook Tom,

32:38.890 --> 32:41.017
the last of the ghetto gunfighters.

32:42.027 --> 32:44.791
I heard you got your best confession
with a '91 directory.

32:44.896 --> 32:47.660
You know Washington was holding
the asshole down.

32:48.934 --> 32:50.458
Is this an interview?

32:50.569 --> 32:52.002
Just a little back and forth.

32:52.103 --> 32:56.904
Well, Captain, I'm not much of a dancer,
so if there's something you'd like to ask...

32:57.342 --> 32:59.310
Want to go and get some lunch, Tom?

33:01.379 --> 33:03.006
This is the interview.

33:03.615 --> 33:07.142
Regarding yesterday's incident,
you were the first on scene, correct?

33:09.054 --> 33:10.578
Yes, sir.

33:10.689 --> 33:13.783
- Three shooters, right?
- Two. Read the report.

33:13.892 --> 33:16.486
What would you say if I told you
the pathologist recovered

33:16.595 --> 33:19.530
three different calibers
from Terrence Washington's body?

33:20.532 --> 33:22.591
Sounds like three shooters to me.

33:23.568 --> 33:25.536
What were you doing there, Tom?

33:30.642 --> 33:32.610
Come on, man to man. Tape's off.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.147
Damn it!

33:37.249 --> 33:40.047
It doesn't bother you that
there are two cop killers out there?

33:40.151 --> 33:42.483
Living, laughing, fucking?
It doesn't bother you, Tom?

33:42.587 --> 33:44.020
Yes, it bothers me!

33:45.223 --> 33:47.350
So, why'd you let them
get away, gunfighter?

33:47.459 --> 33:50.860
Hey, let's get something straight, Captain,
nobody's getting away.

33:50.962 --> 33:53.328
What happened to the video
from the store?

33:54.432 --> 33:55.831
What video?

33:56.635 --> 33:59.729
Listen to me. Every time you shit the bed,

33:59.838 --> 34:03.171
Wander's there to change the sheets.
Well, not anymore, son.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.209
I'm going to pour gas on you,

34:05.310 --> 34:08.473
I'm going to pour gas on Wander
and everyone in Vice Special.

34:08.580 --> 34:11.777
Then I'm lighting the match
and I'm gonna burn all of you.

34:12.551 --> 34:15.076
I tried to save you, Detective Ludlow.

34:15.186 --> 34:17.518
Your window's closed.

34:17.621 --> 34:21.991
And that third shooter?
He's mine, so help me God.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.128
Get back in your office!

34:30.802 --> 34:33.464
- Captain, you there?
- I'll call you back.

34:35.206 --> 34:37.264
What the fuck are you doing in my office?

34:37.375 --> 34:40.003
What the fuck are you doing
jamming my people at lunch?

34:40.110 --> 34:42.875
If you got a problem with Ludlow,
you come to me.

34:42.981 --> 34:45.108
You keep your dog on a leash.

34:45.382 --> 34:47.783
Everybody knows
he can't make a move without you.

34:47.886 --> 34:48.944
You go cry to Daddy?

34:49.054 --> 34:50.418
Stop right there.

34:51.121 --> 34:52.418
Stop.

34:53.958 --> 34:56.757
Tom is a damn fine cop.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.229
He bleeds blue.

35:00.899 --> 35:02.867
You got an open case on him?

35:03.435 --> 35:04.732
Vice Special?

35:05.570 --> 35:07.094
You got one on me?

35:08.340 --> 35:10.399
You formally investigating us?

35:13.445 --> 35:15.310
This is a fishing expedition.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.412
Because you know if you went to the Chief
and you asked him

35:18.516 --> 35:20.780
to open a case on me
or anybody in my unit,

35:20.885 --> 35:22.375
he would laugh you out of his office.

35:22.487 --> 35:24.682
Listen to me, you piece of shit.

35:24.789 --> 35:27.883
I have watched you intimidate,
bully and blackmail

35:27.993 --> 35:30.188
your way up through the pay grades
for 20 plus years.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.354
I know exactly what you are.

35:33.498 --> 35:36.262
You've got no business being
a commander.

35:37.535 --> 35:40.129
You like Tom, don't you?

35:42.707 --> 35:45.267
I saw the way you watched him
when he came in.

35:45.377 --> 35:48.835
That's why you follow him around,
you want him to give you a blow job.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.646
Like that hooker I caught you with
when we were sergeants.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.241
- You remember?
- Shut up, Jack.

35:54.352 --> 35:58.789
Does your wife know that
you use prostitutes, Jimmy?

36:00.291 --> 36:02.589
It was the best head I ever had.

36:03.194 --> 36:04.957
And what about you, Jack?

36:05.063 --> 36:08.362
You always found it hard to keep
your prick out of the ghetto.

36:08.466 --> 36:12.493
It's a two-way street, buddy.
You can't ride the tiger forever.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.029
Now get the hell out of my office.

36:15.140 --> 36:17.040
Do the department a favor,

36:17.809 --> 36:20.300
and wash your mouth out with buckshot.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.210
Come on, Tom. Let's get out of here.

36:31.556 --> 36:36.721
From his time on the street
to his time in your schools and homes,

36:37.796 --> 36:40.264
Detective Washington was tireless

36:40.732 --> 36:44.691
in his devotion to his church,
his love for his family,

36:45.103 --> 36:47.594
and his dedication to this department.

36:47.872 --> 36:51.399
Uniform Detail. Atten-hut!

36:51.976 --> 36:54.945
Honor Guard, port arms!

36:56.848 --> 36:58.975
Half right face!

37:00.185 --> 37:03.552
Ready, aim, fire!

37:03.922 --> 37:05.480
Aim, fire!

37:06.091 --> 37:08.116
Aim, fire!

37:08.993 --> 37:12.156
Uniform Detail, present arms!

37:35.787 --> 37:38.085
He was a good guy. We'll miss him.

37:38.456 --> 37:40.356
We'll go back to work now. Back to work.

37:40.458 --> 37:44.360
- Listen, that was a nice speech. Thank you.
- Let's go get them.

37:44.729 --> 37:45.855
Thank you, sir.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.571
Mrs. Washington.

38:05.150 --> 38:06.708
I was first on scene.

38:06.818 --> 38:08.547
Yeah, of course you were.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.015
Excuse me.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.937
You Diskant?

38:30.708 --> 38:31.834
Yeah.

38:33.111 --> 38:34.772
You're working Washington?

38:36.014 --> 38:37.140
Yeah.

38:37.515 --> 38:39.142
You know who I am?

38:39.584 --> 38:40.551
Yes.

38:41.286 --> 38:43.345
You planning on interviewing me?

38:44.656 --> 38:46.021
You're on my list.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.593
Well, let's get rolling. Where do I start?

38:50.261 --> 38:53.230
Gang books? Mug shots? 211 reports?

38:55.700 --> 38:56.792
If you want.

38:56.901 --> 38:59.563
Come on, Diskant,
you've worked a homicide before.

39:01.206 --> 39:02.730
I'm two for two.

39:04.108 --> 39:07.441
Okay, two for two,
you got a ballistics report?

39:07.545 --> 39:10.070
No. The bullets are still at the coroner's.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.649
Yeah, but they're giving you
updates, right?

39:12.750 --> 39:15.844
They tell you how many different calibers
they dug out of Washington?

39:15.954 --> 39:17.751
- What do you want?
- How many?

39:23.061 --> 39:24.688
Goodbye, Detective.

39:33.338 --> 39:34.464
- Harry!
- Hey.

39:35.006 --> 39:36.803
I thought you were dead.

39:58.162 --> 39:59.959
I'm from Vice Special.

40:02.166 --> 40:04.464
Tom Ludlow.
I know who you are.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.895
I handled your wife's autopsy.

40:08.606 --> 40:10.699
- That was you?
- Mmm-hmm.

40:10.808 --> 40:12.366
The asshole. Remember?

40:13.077 --> 40:14.374
Right.

40:14.946 --> 40:18.040
The guy who washed away all the hair
and fiber evidence.

40:18.283 --> 40:20.615
The guy who wouldn't do a vaginal swab.

40:21.019 --> 40:23.249
The guy who left me nothing to go on.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.254
It's not my job to investigate adultery.

40:26.357 --> 40:27.792
How can I help you?

40:27.792 --> 40:28.087
How can I help you?

40:32.830 --> 40:35.697
- Pulled these out of Washington?
- Yup.

40:36.401 --> 40:37.629
Eighteen rounds.

40:37.735 --> 40:39.794
Ten.45-caliber full metal jackets.

40:39.904 --> 40:41.531
Seven 9-mil FMJs.

40:41.639 --> 40:45.040
And a single.38 hollow-point
mushroomed against his scapula.

40:45.310 --> 40:46.402
Serious overkill.

40:46.511 --> 40:49.002
He must have really pissed off
the shooters.

40:51.749 --> 40:53.546
Get what you're looking for?

40:55.853 --> 40:58.378
Hi, I'm Detective Diskant.
We spoke on the phone earlier.

40:58.489 --> 41:00.389
- I'm here for the ballistics evidence.
- How you doing?

41:00.491 --> 41:01.788
Thank you.

41:02.026 --> 41:03.584
When can I expect your report?

41:03.695 --> 41:06.664
Give me about an hour or so.
The lab's backlogged today.

41:06.764 --> 41:09.892
- Thanks. Can you fax it to my office?
- Sure can.

41:10.001 --> 41:11.468
Thank you, Doc.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.308
Diskant, talk to me.

41:22.080 --> 41:25.447
You got three different calibers,
that means three weapons.

41:25.683 --> 41:28.481
What's your take on what went down
in that market?

41:29.520 --> 41:31.715
Two bad guys come in the front door
to rob the place.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.814
One of them sees the clerk,
cuts him in half.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.085
The other one sees Washington,

41:35.193 --> 41:38.321
whose weapon is already drawn,
empties his clip into him.

41:38.563 --> 41:41.031
His buddy joins the party till he runs dry.

41:41.432 --> 41:42.558
And one of them pulls a two-incher,

41:42.667 --> 41:45.659
pumps a final "fuck you" round
into Washington's back.

41:46.037 --> 41:48.301
They leave, you show up

41:49.140 --> 41:50.767
after they're gone.

41:51.909 --> 41:53.843
You got it all figured out.

41:57.815 --> 42:01.478
I got your back here, but you got to keep
your distance and let me work this case.

42:01.586 --> 42:04.146
No one's gonna find these assholes.
Is that what you need to hear from me?

42:04.255 --> 42:05.984
Are you fucking kidding me?

42:07.058 --> 42:08.787
They get a pass, you get a pass.
That's the deal, right?

42:08.893 --> 42:11.521
What are you talking about,
the shooters get a pass?

42:11.629 --> 42:13.529
I don't understand,
Clady said you were on board.

42:13.631 --> 42:15.155
Not with this.

42:15.266 --> 42:17.894
What's the deal, are you throwing
this case for a promotion?

42:18.002 --> 42:19.663
If I were you,
I'd be more worried about yourself.

42:19.771 --> 42:22.934
Hey, you piece of shit!
You got a 187 on a peace officer

42:23.041 --> 42:24.872
and you're fucking letting
the suspects walk!

42:24.976 --> 42:26.705
- You want these guys found?
- That doesn't piss you off?

42:26.811 --> 42:28.608
- So they can put you at the store?
- Doesn't it piss you off?

42:28.713 --> 42:30.078
Place you at the store
before the shooting?

42:30.181 --> 42:31.773
You want to catch a felony
for obstruction?

42:31.883 --> 42:34.477
If I say you weren't there,
you weren't there.

42:35.787 --> 42:38.255
This is your mess and I'm cleaning it up.

42:38.356 --> 42:39.823
Yeah, it pisses me off!

42:42.293 --> 42:43.260
Diskant.

42:44.662 --> 42:45.788
Yeah.

42:46.364 --> 42:48.662
Yes. Hang on one second.

42:53.371 --> 42:54.838
All right, go ahead.

42:56.374 --> 42:58.968
All right, thank you. Bye-bye.

43:02.480 --> 43:03.572
Fremont and Coates.

43:03.681 --> 43:07.481
The lab found saliva on a cigarette butt
and the bandana outside the store.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.177
DNA corresponds to those two names.

43:09.287 --> 43:11.517
Congratulations, you IDed the shooters.

43:11.622 --> 43:13.647
Yeah. Normally, I'd be pretty happy.

43:13.758 --> 43:16.693
Pull their rap sheets. Give me copies.

43:16.794 --> 43:18.022
I'll see you around.

43:24.836 --> 43:27.100
Computer says you arrested these guys.

43:28.506 --> 43:31.634
Fremont and Coates.

43:31.742 --> 43:34.108
Good guys. Say hi for me.

43:34.212 --> 43:35.577
You remember them?

43:35.680 --> 43:39.081
Who can forget?
Heroin dealers with a taste for blood.

43:40.218 --> 43:43.881
Came up from Belize to make a sale
and they liked the Southland so much,

43:43.988 --> 43:44.977
they never left.

43:45.089 --> 43:49.492
Yeah. We hooked these two fine
gentlemen on a rape-mutilation caper.

43:49.594 --> 43:53.189
Seems they had a three-day hostage-fest
with this cute little Guatemalan chick

43:53.297 --> 43:56.164
that they snatched up when
she was walking home from dental school.

43:56.267 --> 43:57.234
They hurt her bad.

43:57.335 --> 44:00.065
- Then why are they on the street?
- They walked from the beef.

44:00.171 --> 44:04.301
One of our own felt we violated
Mr. Coates' and Mr. Fremont's civil rights

44:04.408 --> 44:06.171
and told the City Attorney.

44:06.277 --> 44:09.007
- Washington dimed you out?
- Yep.

44:10.047 --> 44:12.311
Why do you think they put the dude
in Community Relations?

44:12.416 --> 44:14.145
Are you shitting me?

44:14.252 --> 44:16.846
Washington kicked loose the very guys
who whacked him?

44:16.954 --> 44:19.354
Damn ironic, isn't it?

44:19.457 --> 44:22.517
Oh, guys! What is this, a garage sale?

44:23.661 --> 44:26.289
How you doing, Lud? What's this? Why...

44:27.698 --> 44:29.461
Lud, why do you have this?

44:29.567 --> 44:31.933
Those are the shitbags
who popped Washington.

44:32.036 --> 44:33.367
Sarge, we can get these guys.

44:33.471 --> 44:36.372
No, no.
Not if you want to keep your badge.

44:36.474 --> 44:39.409
Besides, these two animals?
These guys, they'll take care of each other.

44:39.510 --> 44:40.704
They'll be dead by the end of the week.

44:40.811 --> 44:43.279
Probably shoot each other's fucking faces
off, knowing these two.

44:43.381 --> 44:44.370
You know how that shit works.

44:44.482 --> 44:48.009
This week's suspects,
next week's victims, right?

44:50.054 --> 44:51.419
Yeah, right.

45:06.070 --> 45:07.867
What the hell are you doing here, Tom?

45:07.972 --> 45:09.269
Let's talk.

45:23.955 --> 45:25.889
I'm sick of this shit, man.

45:25.990 --> 45:28.356
It's the same damn song for three years.

45:28.459 --> 45:30.051
Crying about your wife.

45:30.962 --> 45:32.293
She's gone, Tom.

45:33.664 --> 45:36.428
What's it gonna take to
bring you back from Mars?

45:39.237 --> 45:40.761
Have I ever asked you for anything?

45:40.871 --> 45:42.395
You know what?
You ask me for shit all the time.

45:42.506 --> 45:45.202
Big things, Jack. Important things.

45:46.677 --> 45:47.939
What's up, Tom?

45:48.446 --> 45:52.007
Give me a green light to take out
the assholes who did Washington.

45:52.817 --> 45:55.786
Come on, Jack. King's X.

45:57.154 --> 45:58.712
What the hell is this?

45:58.956 --> 46:02.255
I can lay them out like I did those Koreans,
but off the books.

46:02.360 --> 46:06.160
I'm talking shovels and trash bags.
Who's gonna know? Who's gonna care?

46:06.264 --> 46:07.663
The Koreans?

46:08.266 --> 46:10.063
That... That was business.

46:10.434 --> 46:14.803
This? This is some crazy bullshit rattling
around in that drunk-ass mind of yours.

46:15.172 --> 46:18.972
Look at yourself!
Look at yourself, Tom! You're a mess!

46:20.578 --> 46:22.569
When did you start drinking today?

46:22.680 --> 46:25.274
Your little airplane bottles of vodka?

46:25.950 --> 46:28.316
And you drove over here intoxicated.
You want a second DUI?

46:28.419 --> 46:31.320
No one's going to fuck with me, Jack!
You're not listening to me!

46:31.422 --> 46:32.855
You're not listening to me!

46:32.957 --> 46:35.619
No, you listen to me!

46:35.726 --> 46:38.490
This is much bigger than that.

46:40.097 --> 46:41.962
Do you think Biggs is stupid?

46:42.066 --> 46:45.058
He's got a PhD in catching cops slipping.

46:46.203 --> 46:48.831
You know this. You know all this.

46:50.374 --> 46:52.069
You got to hold your mud.

46:52.443 --> 46:53.876
Can you do that?

46:55.413 --> 46:58.814
It's time to turn the page
and close the book.

47:09.293 --> 47:10.555
They took $200?

47:11.395 --> 47:13.955
I... I forgot about it till I saw this.

47:15.533 --> 47:16.795
That's the man.

47:17.768 --> 47:18.860
That's him.

47:20.371 --> 47:23.898
He took all my pay.
Said it was for the cookie jar.

47:25.910 --> 47:27.343
The cookie jar?

47:27.578 --> 47:28.636
That's what he said.

47:33.384 --> 47:34.851
I'll be right back.

47:50.167 --> 47:51.930
What do you want, Disco?

47:53.571 --> 47:56.938
Washington was dirty.
He was a piece of shit.

48:00.544 --> 48:02.341
Why are you telling me this?

48:02.546 --> 48:04.036
I think you know why.

48:05.483 --> 48:06.950
I know why.

48:09.820 --> 48:12.755
- Are you recording this, huh?
- That's a new phone.

48:12.857 --> 48:15.189
You working for Internal Affairs?

48:15.292 --> 48:16.884
You made one deal.

48:16.994 --> 48:18.586
Maybe you made two.

48:18.696 --> 48:21.756
Captain Biggs flip you
to the dark side, punk?

48:22.833 --> 48:24.300
You know what?

48:26.337 --> 48:27.998
They're right about you.

48:28.172 --> 48:29.867
You are fucking out there.

48:30.641 --> 48:33.041
From now on, you stay away from me.
We don't talk.

48:33.144 --> 48:35.772
All right, hold on, Disco. Hold on. Hold on.

48:37.581 --> 48:40.243
I gotta watch my own back these days,
you know?

48:40.985 --> 48:42.612
Come on. Don't be mad.

48:42.887 --> 48:44.514
Washington was dirty.

48:46.957 --> 48:48.754
Hit me, princess.

48:49.160 --> 48:50.422
Go on.

48:51.395 --> 48:53.192
A couple things.

48:53.964 --> 48:56.524
You know we found $50,000 in cash
on him at the store.

48:56.634 --> 48:59.865
No, I didn't. That's a lot of cash,
but not in itself damning.

48:59.970 --> 49:01.437
Oh, but this is.

49:02.039 --> 49:03.097
Looks like an evidence tag.

49:03.207 --> 49:04.640
I found it in Washington's truck.

49:04.742 --> 49:07.802
I had SID scan it.
Corresponds to a kilo of heroin.

49:08.446 --> 49:10.971
Guess who comes along
and signs out the dope?

49:11.182 --> 49:12.649
Washington?

49:12.750 --> 49:15.810
Washington signed out heroin
and returned brown sugar.

49:18.389 --> 49:20.584
The guys who whacked him moved dope.

49:21.826 --> 49:25.353
You know, Washington sprung them from
a rape beef on a technicality.

49:25.463 --> 49:28.921
No, I did not know that.
Maybe they had a business arrangement.

49:30.201 --> 49:31.634
Maybe it was a hit.

49:31.936 --> 49:34.268
That would explain the heavy artillery.

49:36.373 --> 49:38.238
Washington deserved it, right?

49:38.909 --> 49:41.173
He was dirty, so fuck him.

49:42.313 --> 49:44.110
I feel much better
about the suspects walking.

49:44.215 --> 49:45.876
And you, you must feel better too, right?

49:45.983 --> 49:47.780
We're doing the right thing.

49:51.355 --> 49:53.915
No shame if you want to take your pass.

49:59.129 --> 50:01.324
This has to be you and me.

50:03.234 --> 50:05.896
Why do you think
we're in the goddamn bathroom?

50:26.857 --> 50:29.621
This is it. Last known address.

51:04.328 --> 51:05.295
Okay.

51:09.099 --> 51:12.398
A family here now.
Our boys are long gone.

51:14.138 --> 51:15.435
All right, Disco.

51:16.574 --> 51:19.099
See those yahoos? I'm going to jam them.

51:19.209 --> 51:23.077
And when I do, one of them is gonna bolt.
That's the one that's dirty.

51:24.381 --> 51:25.939
You bored or something?

51:26.450 --> 51:27.712
This is their hood.

51:27.818 --> 51:30.446
Anyone knows Fremont and Coates,
they do.

51:34.391 --> 51:35.619
Hold this, mija.

51:42.900 --> 51:44.197
Get him.

51:46.904 --> 51:49.031
Get out of here, Supercut!

51:53.310 --> 51:56.108
Fuck off.
You're in the wrong neighborhood, homes.

51:59.984 --> 52:01.474
Watch out! Watch out!

52:02.987 --> 52:03.954
Move!

52:08.492 --> 52:09.754
Yo, run, homie!

52:32.549 --> 52:34.517
Yo, Spencer.

53:15.626 --> 53:16.888
I had him.

53:18.962 --> 53:20.259
Why you running, man?

53:20.364 --> 53:23.629
Hey, get me the fuck down,
man. This shit's cutting me, man!

53:25.069 --> 53:26.297
- Get me the fuck down, man!
- What else?

53:26.403 --> 53:28.428
What else? What else?

53:29.273 --> 53:31.400
What the fuck are you doing?

53:33.077 --> 53:34.305
So, what do they call ya?

53:34.411 --> 53:36.777
They call me...
They call me fucking Quicks, man.

53:36.880 --> 53:39.371
- Quicks? Not quick enough.
- Quick.

53:39.483 --> 53:40.677
Hey, get me the fuck down, homes.

53:40.784 --> 53:42.513
Please, man,
this shit's cutting me, dawg.

53:42.619 --> 53:44.177
Fremont and Coates.

53:44.288 --> 53:46.256
They were staying across from the house
you were partying at.

53:46.356 --> 53:47.516
You know them?

53:47.624 --> 53:49.592
I don't fucking know them fools, man!

53:49.693 --> 53:51.593
I'm a fucking Southsider, all right, ese?

53:51.695 --> 53:53.560
I don't be fucking party
with no brothers and shit.

53:53.664 --> 53:54.653
Man, what the fuck you doing?

53:54.765 --> 53:56.790
- They're from Belize.
- Shit!

53:56.900 --> 53:58.731
- Who knows them? Who knows them?
- All right!

53:58.836 --> 53:59.928
Who knows them?

54:00.037 --> 54:02.904
Look, mother... Hey, motherfucker,
come on. All right, dawg. Look, look.

54:03.006 --> 54:06.874
Check this out, man.
There's a baller cat on San Pedro, all right?

54:06.977 --> 54:09.502
Dude's name is Grill, man.
He's from 40s town, ese.

54:09.613 --> 54:10.944
- Grill. 40s town.
- All right. Yeah.

54:11.048 --> 54:13.778
Grill, man. That motherfucker,
he knows all of them, all right, man.

54:13.884 --> 54:15.579
Hey! Hey!

54:16.019 --> 54:16.986
What about him?

54:17.087 --> 54:18.918
- He's lucky he's not going to jail.
- Hey. Come on, man.

54:19.022 --> 54:20.319
- I'll run Grill through CALGANG.
- Hey!

54:20.424 --> 54:21.823
- See if I can get an address.
- Hey, fucking white boys.

54:22.226 --> 54:23.921
He's way better than you!

54:24.328 --> 54:27.320
Housemates, report to the backyard.

54:27.431 --> 54:29.729
This is a badminton
challenge between us

54:29.833 --> 54:32.063
and the original cast of Drawn Together.

54:32.169 --> 54:34.069
Prepare to be transformed
into a bunch of losers.

54:35.339 --> 54:36.966
Fuck, man.

54:37.241 --> 54:39.436
Let's make these guys eat shuttlecock.

54:39.979 --> 54:42.675
- Hey, can we get this game going already?
- Shit!

54:43.349 --> 54:44.646
Police! Drop it!

54:46.586 --> 54:48.019
Get on your face!

54:48.120 --> 54:49.985
What the fuck I do, man?

54:53.092 --> 54:54.218
Get your ass in here, Disco.

54:54.327 --> 54:55.624
Somebody tell me
what the fuck I did, man.

54:55.728 --> 54:56.956
Shut up.

55:23.589 --> 55:24.749
Shit!

55:27.493 --> 55:29.654
You got two strikes, Grill.

55:29.762 --> 55:32.856
This is three strikes. Twenty-five to life.

55:33.032 --> 55:35.262
That ain't my fucking shit. Fuck you.

55:35.368 --> 55:39.134
You put that shit there.
Dirty-ass, punk-ass cop.

55:46.245 --> 55:47.576
Ah, man!

55:48.214 --> 55:50.182
Whoa! Oh! What are you...

55:50.683 --> 55:53.117
- Whoa. Whoa! Ludlow!
- Shit!

55:53.219 --> 55:54.652
What the fuck, man?

55:56.422 --> 55:59.050
Whoa! Whoa! Stop!

55:59.825 --> 56:02.726
Fuck, man. Listen to your boy, man. Shit!

56:02.828 --> 56:04.125
Don't you have to ask him
something first?

56:04.230 --> 56:06.528
Homie right, man. Aren't you
supposed to ask me some shit first?

56:06.632 --> 56:08.361
Fremont and Coates, where they at?

56:08.467 --> 56:10.560
Fuck, man. Stop hitting me
on my fucking head first

56:10.670 --> 56:12.001
and I'll tell you.

56:12.972 --> 56:15.372
Where do they fucking stay?

56:17.777 --> 56:19.472
You're fucking crazy, man.

56:19.578 --> 56:20.636
I don't know where they at.

56:20.746 --> 56:23.442
Cats have been banned from the hood
for a minute, man.

56:23.549 --> 56:25.710
If I catch them slipping,
I'm gonna bust they motherfucking head.

56:25.818 --> 56:29.276
Answer the fucking question!
How do we find them?

56:30.489 --> 56:34.653
The only cats I know that know them
is up in the County, man. High power.

56:34.760 --> 56:38.025
- I'm going to book you into County.
- For what, man? For what?

56:39.198 --> 56:41.962
Talk to your friends, find me Fremont and
Coates and you'll be out by tomorrow.

56:42.068 --> 56:44.195
Otherwise, I'm gonna book you
for the dope and AK.

56:44.303 --> 56:46.237
Fuck, man! Fuck, man!

56:51.777 --> 56:53.574
I ain't no fucking snitch, man.

56:53.679 --> 56:56.614
I know that.
There won't be no jacket, no papers.

56:57.216 --> 56:58.513
It's just you and me.

56:58.617 --> 57:00.585
Fuck, fuck, fuck, man!

57:01.821 --> 57:04.619
Come on, they ain't nothing to you.
I want them.

57:05.791 --> 57:08.089
All right, man. Fuck it, man.

57:50.035 --> 57:51.832
Mrs. Washington.

57:55.508 --> 57:57.533
Can we talk outside?

58:08.154 --> 58:10.645
Terrence had $50,000 in cash on him.

58:11.724 --> 58:15.455
His death might be more than just
wrong place, wrong time.

58:17.096 --> 58:18.529
Might be?

58:19.498 --> 58:22.797
How many people knew he was
talking to Internal Affairs?

58:24.770 --> 58:26.567
My husband had a good heart.

58:27.440 --> 58:30.739
And when he started listening to it,
he became a pariah.

58:31.877 --> 58:33.174
His eyes opened.

58:33.712 --> 58:35.407
When will your eyes open?

58:37.149 --> 58:39.879
Terrence always said
you were the worst one.

58:40.853 --> 58:44.619
Because with all the shit going on
around you, you choose not to see.

58:44.723 --> 58:47.487
- Look, I came here to help you.
- Help me?

58:47.593 --> 58:50.255
You came to help yourself sleep at night.

58:50.362 --> 58:52.592
That $50,000,
you think Terrence was stupid?

58:52.698 --> 58:56.725
He knew he had a bull's-eye on his back
the second he went to Captain Biggs.

58:57.236 --> 58:58.863
So we sold our house.

58:59.972 --> 59:02.600
We were leaving Friday for the Bahamas.

59:03.709 --> 59:05.176
To start over.

59:06.812 --> 59:08.677
Silly of us, wasn't it?

59:11.517 --> 59:13.485
Anything else, Detective?

59:15.688 --> 59:16.814
No.

59:25.464 --> 59:27.193
Lud!

59:28.100 --> 59:29.897
What the fuck?

59:30.069 --> 59:34.130
- Hey. How's Complaints?
- Just missed your wife.

59:34.273 --> 59:37.709
- Oh. She was here? That's cute.
- Yeah.

59:39.211 --> 59:40.872
I got something for you.

59:48.254 --> 59:49.516
That's for you.

59:50.956 --> 59:52.321
- Is that it?
- That's it.

59:52.424 --> 59:53.859
Yeah. That's it.

59:53.859 --> 59:54.348
Yeah. That's it.

59:54.927 --> 59:56.690
You keep it.
A nice little souvenir for yourself.

59:56.795 --> 59:58.558
But, Tom, this is...

59:59.398 --> 01:00:01.025
I mean, it's over.

01:00:04.803 --> 01:00:06.703
Tom, this is over.

01:00:09.608 --> 01:00:11.735
We got your back, Tom.

01:00:38.938 --> 01:00:41.600
- Yeah.
- It's your man in high power.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.432
- I got that name.
- Fire away.

01:00:43.542 --> 01:00:46.943
It's this OG dude.
Sell a little of this, little of that.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.147
Drive an old-ass Cadillac.

01:00:49.248 --> 01:00:52.376
- Name.
- Scribble. They call him Scribble.

01:00:52.785 --> 01:00:55.845
His real name's Winston or some shit.
I don't know.

01:00:56.088 --> 01:00:59.057
- Man, get me up out of here.
- It's on its way.

01:00:59.858 --> 01:01:01.587
I can't believe this shit worked.

01:01:01.694 --> 01:01:03.559
Scribble. It's catchy.

01:01:03.762 --> 01:01:05.730
I got a Metro unit tailing him.

01:01:06.732 --> 01:01:08.097
Go get him, Disco.

01:01:09.101 --> 01:01:11.399
- Make me proud.
- You're not coming?

01:01:19.345 --> 01:01:22.678
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Watch it! Watch it!
- You married, Diskant?

01:01:23.882 --> 01:01:26.749
Engaged. And I'd like to see her again.

01:01:27.453 --> 01:01:29.648
Hey, you ever hear of something called
the "cookie jar"

01:01:29.755 --> 01:01:33.054
in reference to corruption, shakedowns,
Serpico shit?

01:01:33.425 --> 01:01:34.551
No. Why?

01:01:34.693 --> 01:01:36.388
A complaint I'm working on.

01:01:36.495 --> 01:01:38.087
We're eastbound
on Vernon passing Fig.

01:01:38.197 --> 01:01:39.630
Do you want us to jam them?

01:01:39.732 --> 01:01:42.724
That's a negative. Just keep eyes on
and call it out. We're en route.

01:01:42.835 --> 01:01:44.302
Watch the crosswalk!

01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:45.837
Hey!

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:49.666
There he is.

01:01:50.009 --> 01:01:51.533
We got him. Break off.

01:01:51.644 --> 01:01:52.941
That's a rog.

01:01:55.381 --> 01:01:56.348
What the fuck, nigga?

01:01:56.448 --> 01:01:57.915
Dub-C, you better duck, nigga

01:01:58.017 --> 01:01:58.984
Shit.

01:02:04.123 --> 01:02:06.887
I was raised in the hood
called what the fuck, nigga

01:02:09.728 --> 01:02:11.662
Hands where I can see them!

01:02:16.468 --> 01:02:18.936
What the hell y'all supposed to be, man?
Narcs?

01:02:19.271 --> 01:02:20.898
Yeah, we're narcs.

01:02:21.573 --> 01:02:24.940
Look how pinned out your eyes are.
Taking a little off the top?

01:02:25.044 --> 01:02:26.739
Little jones maintenance?

01:02:27.146 --> 01:02:28.238
You need to kick that shit.

01:02:28.347 --> 01:02:30.645
I got a lawyer. You might want to talk
to him. I got his card.

01:02:30.749 --> 01:02:32.910
You, wake up. Nothing's happened yet.

01:02:33.152 --> 01:02:36.053
But FYI,
you know you got a no-bail warrant.

01:02:36.689 --> 01:02:39.089
I put the cuffs on now,
you're locked up until the apocalypse.

01:02:39.191 --> 01:02:41.523
Well, whatever, man.
I mean, take me in right now, dawg.

01:02:41.627 --> 01:02:42.753
I mean, read me my Mirandas.

01:02:42.861 --> 01:02:45.193
Put your hands back on the fucking wheel!

01:02:45.297 --> 01:02:47.322
Yo, two for two!
Watch those fucking jokers.

01:02:47.433 --> 01:02:49.731
Get back! Get the fuck back!

01:02:49.902 --> 01:02:51.335
What the fuck you looking at, white boy?

01:02:51.437 --> 01:02:53.405
Get the fuck back!

01:02:53.505 --> 01:02:55.666
You really want to kick heroin in County?

01:02:55.774 --> 01:02:59.039
Want to see the judge all sick,
shitting and puking yourself?

01:02:59.144 --> 01:03:01.772
That would look real good. And for what?

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.711
You're just a rung on a ladder
I'm climbing.

01:03:03.816 --> 01:03:05.113
What ladder, man?

01:03:05.984 --> 01:03:08.612
How do I find Fremont and Coates?

01:03:10.889 --> 01:03:14.723
Look, I ain't got no love for them
banana boat motherfuckers, man.

01:03:14.827 --> 01:03:16.226
But them dudes are straight monsters.

01:03:16.328 --> 01:03:18.558
They'll put me in a box
if they think I'm snitching.

01:03:18.664 --> 01:03:20.598
I'm not asking to finger the guys
in open court.

01:03:20.699 --> 01:03:22.394
I just want to find them.

01:03:22.501 --> 01:03:24.799
Once I do, you're out of the mix.

01:03:25.771 --> 01:03:27.671
I ain't seen them in a week, man.

01:03:27.773 --> 01:03:28.967
You got a number?

01:03:29.074 --> 01:03:33.135
No, I ain't got no number.
Them dudes drop phones all the time.

01:03:33.245 --> 01:03:34.974
They call me, man.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.173
Look man, your man making me nervous
back here. Could you...

01:03:37.282 --> 01:03:38.840
Look at me. Look at me!

01:03:39.384 --> 01:03:43.115
You wanna see that judge
or you gonna help me find them?

01:03:44.423 --> 01:03:48.883
Look, I did business with them
one time in El Sereno.

01:03:50.262 --> 01:03:53.698
Little bitty-ass house way up in the hills.
That's it.

01:03:56.902 --> 01:03:58.301
Show me.

01:03:58.403 --> 01:04:01.065
You expect me to leave my car
in the hood, man?

01:04:48.754 --> 01:04:50.381
Someone had a party.

01:05:14.847 --> 01:05:16.144
Smell that?

01:05:45.944 --> 01:05:47.571
Want me to put it out?

01:05:50.015 --> 01:05:52.210
No. Get the murder book.

01:05:58.957 --> 01:06:00.754
This is Fremont.

01:06:03.762 --> 01:06:07.528
And this is his buddy, Coates.

01:06:10.202 --> 01:06:11.396
We found them.

01:06:11.503 --> 01:06:12.470
Great.

01:06:13.105 --> 01:06:14.697
Case closed.

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:18.737
These guys have been here a while.
There's no way they killed Washington.

01:06:18.844 --> 01:06:20.141
You think?

01:06:21.213 --> 01:06:23.579
Fuck you. I'm doing my best.

01:06:24.583 --> 01:06:27.381
If Fremont and Coates
didn't kill Washington, who did?

01:06:27.486 --> 01:06:28.453
Who're we chasing?

01:06:28.587 --> 01:06:30.077
The assholes who smoked these guys,

01:06:30.188 --> 01:06:32.713
harvested their DNA and planted it
in the market. That's who.

01:06:32.824 --> 01:06:36.123
I'm with you.
But why do you frame two dead dudes?

01:06:37.629 --> 01:06:39.324
We're going to ask them.

01:06:40.966 --> 01:06:42.263
Let's go.

01:06:50.208 --> 01:06:51.675
What's up, man?

01:06:51.777 --> 01:06:53.438
You know there's coyotes out here
and shit, right?

01:06:53.545 --> 01:06:54.978
Y'all been gone a minute.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.547
You know these guys?

01:06:58.917 --> 01:07:01.147
No, man. I ain't never seen these dudes.

01:07:02.554 --> 01:07:05.387
Look, if Fremont and Coates call you,
set up a meeting.

01:07:05.490 --> 01:07:08.482
You tell them I can do for them
what Washington can't anymore.

01:07:08.593 --> 01:07:10.493
They'll know what you mean.

01:07:14.299 --> 01:07:16.961
All right, man. I'll hook it up.

01:07:18.036 --> 01:07:20.368
- Will you take me back to my car?
- Sure.

01:07:43.295 --> 01:07:46.230
- Have a nice swim?
- Yeah.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:51.533
I hope you guys are playing nice
with the new girl.

01:07:52.337 --> 01:07:54.805
- Is Tom taking care of you?
- I take care of him.

01:07:54.906 --> 01:07:56.305
Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:07:56.608 --> 01:07:57.700
How's Complaints, Lud?

01:07:57.809 --> 01:07:58.776
Oh!

01:08:00.178 --> 01:08:03.079
I'd rather scrape up body parts
at a traffic collision.

01:08:03.181 --> 01:08:05.206
See, Tommy falls apart
when he's not chasing bad guys.

01:08:05.317 --> 01:08:06.306
He's always been like that.

01:08:06.418 --> 01:08:08.579
He was born without the fear gene.
I could tell you some stories.

01:08:08.687 --> 01:08:11.417
- Tell me!
- No, no, we don't kiss and tell around here.

01:08:11.523 --> 01:08:13.923
Now, I got the classic Tom Ludlow story.

01:08:14.026 --> 01:08:16.859
When he was a rookie,
I took him under my wing.

01:08:16.962 --> 01:08:20.453
It was a Friday night, and we're in
Crip City, it's a project in Watts.

01:08:20.564 --> 01:08:22.897
Lots of dope, shootings,
whatever, what have you.

01:08:23.001 --> 01:08:26.300
So, we get this call to shut down
this house party.

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:28.769
And Tom, he's like the saltiest boot ever,

01:08:28.874 --> 01:08:32.173
so I figured, you know, let's...
Let's give him a lesson in humility.

01:08:32.277 --> 01:08:34.142
So I send him in there.

01:08:34.479 --> 01:08:35.502
Alone.

01:08:35.613 --> 01:08:37.774
And all of a sudden,
all hell breaks loose, right?

01:08:37.883 --> 01:08:41.613
They got guys coming out the doors,
homeboys flying out the windows...

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.017
Everybody's screaming inside.

01:08:43.121 --> 01:08:45.453
I rush in, I charge in,
and there's Tom, busting heads.

01:08:45.557 --> 01:08:47.649
They wouldn't turn the music down.

01:08:49.294 --> 01:08:50.658
Tom's always gonna be Tom.

01:08:50.761 --> 01:08:53.492
He's like a guided missile.
Locks on, that's it.

01:09:14.086 --> 01:09:16.520
- Yeah?
- Hey, so I just talked to Scribble.

01:09:17.456 --> 01:09:20.913
Freemont and Coates,
or whoever they are, want to meet us.

01:09:22.027 --> 01:09:23.995
- When?
- Tonight.

01:09:25.764 --> 01:09:27.890
I'll see you in Vice in an hour.

01:09:39.243 --> 01:09:41.041
I know it's late. I'm sorry.

01:09:42.948 --> 01:09:44.609
I wanted you to have this.

01:09:44.716 --> 01:09:46.183
And that is?

01:09:47.385 --> 01:09:49.821
It's the video of your husband's murder.

01:09:49.821 --> 01:09:49.843
It's the video of your husband's murder.

01:09:50.255 --> 01:09:51.881
It shows everything.

01:09:52.957 --> 01:09:54.550
Why are you doing this?

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.928
Because I know how not knowing hurts.

01:09:59.464 --> 01:10:02.365
When I lost my wife,
she was with another man.

01:10:04.603 --> 01:10:07.902
She had a blood clot in her brain
and it burst.

01:10:10.542 --> 01:10:13.511
The bastard dumped her outside
a hospital and...

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:17.107
She died alone on the sidewalk.

01:10:21.052 --> 01:10:25.011
Linda, I'm sorry
for wanting to hurt Terrence

01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:27.917
and I'm sorry for your loss.

01:10:29.494 --> 01:10:32.088
I want you to know he didn't die alone,

01:10:32.497 --> 01:10:35.193
and that the men who killed him
are gonna pay.

01:10:46.411 --> 01:10:48.345
That won't bring him back.

01:10:50.315 --> 01:10:52.476
And that won't bring your wife back.

01:10:54.052 --> 01:10:55.349
I don't care.

01:10:58.223 --> 01:10:59.850
Not in my name.

01:11:00.792 --> 01:11:03.590
Please. Not in my name.

01:11:06.097 --> 01:11:08.065
Blood doesn't wash away blood.

01:11:10.001 --> 01:11:11.901
Shouldn't we roll with backup?

01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:15.398
- Fuck backup.
- What? Why?

01:11:16.808 --> 01:11:18.639
What do you think is gonna
happen tonight?

01:11:18.743 --> 01:11:20.472
You think I'm gonna throw the cuffs
on these boys,

01:11:20.579 --> 01:11:23.047
drag them back to the barn
and write it up?

01:11:26.284 --> 01:11:27.615
Here's the deal.

01:11:28.119 --> 01:11:31.213
I'm going out there
and you're going home.

01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:34.691
And we are never,
ever gonna discuss any of this again.

01:11:34.793 --> 01:11:36.226
What? What do you mean?

01:11:36.328 --> 01:11:40.765
It means Fremont and Coates never
existed, and we never met.

01:11:43.902 --> 01:11:45.870
I'm not going home tonight, Tom.

01:11:46.471 --> 01:11:47.563
Look, Paul.

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:52.806
This thing you want, that you think
you want, you don't want.

01:11:53.445 --> 01:11:56.278
You don't know who I am or what I want.

01:11:56.915 --> 01:11:58.883
Who are you to judge me?

01:12:01.119 --> 01:12:03.178
You want to be a gunfighter, huh?

01:12:16.768 --> 01:12:18.235
Then let's do it.

01:12:30.448 --> 01:12:32.313
Back on the night watch, Tom?

01:12:34.185 --> 01:12:37.916
You two keep being seen all over town.

01:12:39.658 --> 01:12:40.647
Tom?

01:12:41.226 --> 01:12:43.922
Did you really think I was gonna
do nothing about you?

01:12:44.029 --> 01:12:46.463
If you are gonna do something, do it now.

01:12:50.535 --> 01:12:53.402
I know you want my scalp
nailed to your wall.

01:12:53.505 --> 01:12:55.666
But then who's gonna go
where the law won't?

01:12:55.774 --> 01:12:57.139
You, Captain?

01:12:58.243 --> 01:13:02.179
You? You going to clean up the needles
and baby parts?

01:13:02.881 --> 01:13:04.007
No.

01:13:04.282 --> 01:13:05.579
You need me.

01:13:05.684 --> 01:13:08.676
All you company men,
you hate me, but you need me.

01:13:12.490 --> 01:13:14.117
Ludlow,

01:13:14.726 --> 01:13:18.093
maybe you're right.
Maybe we do need you.

01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:21.196
But goddamn if you don't need me, son.

01:13:27.939 --> 01:13:29.304
Hey, Detective.

01:13:30.642 --> 01:13:34.738
Did you ever ask yourself if Washington's
dead because he was dirty

01:13:35.213 --> 01:13:36.908
or because he came clean?

01:13:49.327 --> 01:13:51.124
Swap your rounds out.

01:13:52.564 --> 01:13:54.498
We don't want the coroner
digging department-issue

01:13:54.599 --> 01:13:56.362
ammo out of these assholes.

01:13:58.770 --> 01:14:00.397
Use the gloves.

01:14:02.273 --> 01:14:05.333
Jesus.
These are some serious man stoppers.

01:14:07.512 --> 01:14:09.878
So we're just gonna go in there
and kill them?

01:14:12.083 --> 01:14:14.517
No. I'm gonna ask them some questions.

01:14:15.587 --> 01:14:17.452
Then we're gonna kill them.

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:03.597
Fucking time, man.

01:15:05.069 --> 01:15:06.366
We good?

01:15:07.572 --> 01:15:11.531
You know it's some bullshit, right?
These dudes is monsters, man.

01:15:11.643 --> 01:15:15.409
I mean, if they can't fuck it, rob it or kill it,
they don't want it.

01:15:18.650 --> 01:15:19.947
Ready?

01:15:20.518 --> 01:15:21.485
Yeah.

01:15:22.187 --> 01:15:23.654
Make the introduction.

01:15:23.755 --> 01:15:26.383
All right. I tried to tell you.

01:15:27.859 --> 01:15:28.826
Feeling like Vietnam

01:15:28.927 --> 01:15:31.225
Murdering Uncle Toms
I'm crunk like I'm Lil John

01:15:31.329 --> 01:15:32.421
I'm a wizard waving...

01:15:53.151 --> 01:15:55.085
Get the fuck in here.

01:15:56.187 --> 01:15:58.519
You. Move to the fucking wall.

01:15:58.857 --> 01:16:01.985
What the hell is this?
You know we're cops. Deal with it.

01:16:02.093 --> 01:16:05.062
- They cool, LaShawn.
- Shut the fuck up, Scribble.

01:16:06.698 --> 01:16:07.824
Get in there.

01:16:07.932 --> 01:16:10.594
Yo! You think I'm fucking playing?

01:16:10.702 --> 01:16:13.796
Get your ass against the wall
before you find your brains up there.

01:16:13.905 --> 01:16:15.930
We're here to do business.
You want to feel me up,

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.667
come on and try it.

01:16:17.976 --> 01:16:20.274
Oh, shit. You want to feel his shit?

01:16:20.912 --> 01:16:23.210
'Cause he ain't taking it out for you.

01:16:24.115 --> 01:16:27.710
Chill the fuck out, LaShawn.
Scribble say they good.

01:16:27.819 --> 01:16:29.912
Scribs, what's up with these fools, man?

01:16:30.021 --> 01:16:31.716
They good, man. They cool.

01:16:31.923 --> 01:16:32.947
Nigga, take a seat.

01:16:33.057 --> 01:16:34.615
Get the fuck in there!

01:16:36.694 --> 01:16:38.161
You want a drink?

01:16:38.663 --> 01:16:40.290
No, we're good.

01:16:43.101 --> 01:16:46.264
Man, we got the one-time up in here.

01:16:47.105 --> 01:16:49.437
- Mmm-hmm.
- Motherfucking po-po.

01:16:50.108 --> 01:16:52.372
Is there any square cops out there?

01:16:52.644 --> 01:16:54.612
Or is everybody out for theirs?

01:16:55.713 --> 01:16:58.648
Everyone's out for theirs.
Way of the world.

01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:01.678
Dude, cops are like weeds.

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:04.047
You pull one out,

01:17:04.756 --> 01:17:06.690
and two more fucking grow back.

01:17:06.791 --> 01:17:08.588
Well, Washington got greedy.

01:17:12.063 --> 01:17:13.030
Don't shoot me now.

01:17:13.131 --> 01:17:15.622
I'm just gonna get something
out of my pocket.

01:17:20.438 --> 01:17:22.235
This is just a sample.

01:17:23.775 --> 01:17:25.436
We're all about weight.

01:17:25.543 --> 01:17:28.376
We can help you transport,
let you know if there's heat,

01:17:28.479 --> 01:17:30.777
let you know if you're selling
to a narc or a snitch.

01:17:30.882 --> 01:17:33.510
Or bust people and sell you their shit.

01:17:44.963 --> 01:17:47.090
We all about weight, too.

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:52.558
Look at that shit. That's sexy right there.

01:17:52.971 --> 01:17:56.566
That's better than pussy.
That's better than money.

01:17:57.642 --> 01:17:59.735
That ain't no Mexican tar, neither.

01:17:59.877 --> 01:18:03.335
That's that worldwide-war-on-terror
dope, nigga.

01:18:04.048 --> 01:18:06.243
Pure Afghan, homie.

01:18:07.485 --> 01:18:09.476
Blood, we know this cat.

01:18:10.054 --> 01:18:11.578
It's the same motherfucker
that was in the market

01:18:11.689 --> 01:18:14.021
the day we pushed Washington's
wig back.

01:18:15.793 --> 01:18:16.987
Hell, yeah.

01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:20.197
That was you, right?

01:18:20.665 --> 01:18:23.896
Come on, man. Cool, man.
Y'all just chill out, man.

01:18:24.002 --> 01:18:25.731
All right?
I see where this is going, all right?

01:18:25.837 --> 01:18:28.135
Everybody just be cool, man.
We got all these drugs here.

01:18:28.239 --> 01:18:30.139
Let's just get high.
I'm gonna pour me some...

01:18:30.241 --> 01:18:32.038
Shut your fat ass up.

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.048
That's what you here for, dawg?

01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:44.010
You here to get some get-back for that
sorry-ass nigga, Detective Ludlow?

01:18:45.823 --> 01:18:48.087
No. You guys did me a favor.

01:18:49.494 --> 01:18:53.760
So you know who I am
and I know who you're not.

01:18:54.465 --> 01:18:58.026
If you're not Fremont and Coates,
then who the hell are you?

01:19:00.071 --> 01:19:01.163
Who are we,

01:19:01.973 --> 01:19:03.406
Detective?

01:19:05.343 --> 01:19:07.311
We straight nightmares.

01:19:08.246 --> 01:19:11.943
We are walking, talking,
exigent circumstances.

01:19:14.085 --> 01:19:16.212
Ludlow, wait! I know these guys!

01:19:35.807 --> 01:19:37.399
It's over, Detective!

01:19:38.576 --> 01:19:39.634
Shit.

01:19:40.344 --> 01:19:42.175
I'm gonna do your bitch-ass
like my nigga did your partner!

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:43.713
Hold on, Diskant. Hang on.

01:19:43.815 --> 01:19:45.646
Scribble, what the fuck is you doing?

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:47.552
Nigga, pick that gun up
and blast that motherfucker!

01:19:47.552 --> 01:19:48.314
Nigga, pick that gun up
and blast that motherfucker!

01:19:48.419 --> 01:19:49.784
It ain't me, dawg.

01:19:51.756 --> 01:19:53.883
The next one's in your dome, nigga!

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.827
Winston, don't do it.

01:19:57.929 --> 01:20:02.161
Winston? Winston, what the fuck is that?
That's your slave name, nigga?

01:20:02.266 --> 01:20:05.030
Do it, nigga! Man, kill that white boy!

01:20:05.136 --> 01:20:07.627
You white, man? Kill that white boy!

01:20:08.573 --> 01:20:10.404
I can't, man.

01:20:10.508 --> 01:20:11.839
Fuck this nigga!

01:20:14.378 --> 01:20:16.437
I'm out, dawg. Cover me. Come on.

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.947
Hang on, Diskant.

01:20:24.255 --> 01:20:25.449
Hang on.

01:22:33.751 --> 01:22:36.276
- Let me see you.
- Why are you crying?

01:22:37.355 --> 01:22:39.186
Take that off.

01:22:43.794 --> 01:22:45.261
Sit down, Tom.

01:22:48.065 --> 01:22:49.828
It went bad, Grace.

01:22:50.434 --> 01:22:52.902
I know. I know.

01:22:58.276 --> 01:23:00.073
I should have gone alone.

01:23:00.578 --> 01:23:02.773
I took a boy to a gunfight.

01:23:05.349 --> 01:23:06.976
Why are you crying?

01:23:07.652 --> 01:23:09.119
What's wrong?

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:11.017
What's wrong?

01:23:15.226 --> 01:23:16.989
In our coverage
of tonight's top story,

01:23:17.094 --> 01:23:21.360
Detective Tom Ludlow, an 18-year veteran
of the Los Angeles Police Department,

01:23:21.465 --> 01:23:23.695
is wanted in connection with
the shooting deaths

01:23:23.801 --> 01:23:27.464
of two undercover deputy sheriffs
in the early hours of the morning.

01:23:27.605 --> 01:23:31.735
Officials have yet to confirm a third victim,
who may also be a peace officer.

01:23:31.842 --> 01:23:34.402
In addition, they have stated
Detective Ludlow was off-duty

01:23:34.512 --> 01:23:35.774
at the time of the shootings,

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:38.280
and is the only suspect
in yet another tragedy...

01:23:38.382 --> 01:23:40.748
- Cops.
...in the Los Angeles law enforcement.

01:23:40.851 --> 01:23:41.875
Reports continue
to bring you...

01:23:41.986 --> 01:23:44.887
How do they know that?
That they were cops?

01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:48.190
I just left. It's on the news?

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:51.628
Did you do it?

01:23:53.698 --> 01:23:54.824
Of course you did it.

01:23:54.932 --> 01:23:58.459
I had no idea they were deputies.
But I should have.

01:23:58.569 --> 01:24:01.538
"Exigent circumstances." Jesus.

01:24:02.974 --> 01:24:04.566
What is wrong with you?

01:24:04.875 --> 01:24:09.335
Huh? Why can't you have a normal life
like everyone else?

01:24:09.447 --> 01:24:11.711
- I should go.
- No. No.

01:24:11.816 --> 01:24:12.908
You're not going out there.

01:24:13.017 --> 01:24:15.781
This is gonna be a nightmare, Grace.
I've got to go.

01:24:15.886 --> 01:24:18.980
No. No, Tom. This door is staying closed.

01:24:19.824 --> 01:24:22.554
Every cop in LA is hunting for you.
You want to get killed?

01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:25.390
Grace. Grace.

01:24:25.496 --> 01:24:28.226
You need to get away from me. Okay?

01:24:28.332 --> 01:24:30.027
You need to get far away.

01:24:32.269 --> 01:24:34.203
Everything I touch dies.

01:24:36.007 --> 01:24:37.406
Down on the fucking floor!

01:24:37.508 --> 01:24:40.136
- On the fucking floor, now!
- I'm not resisting!

01:24:42.346 --> 01:24:43.574
Don't say a fucking word.

01:24:43.681 --> 01:24:45.842
- No, please.
- Shut up.

01:24:47.885 --> 01:24:49.011
Get up.

01:24:53.157 --> 01:24:54.454
You're an asshole. You're going down.

01:24:54.558 --> 01:24:57.425
Killed two fucking cops.
What's the matter with you?

01:24:58.929 --> 01:25:01.056
Get that piece of shit out of here.

01:25:14.779 --> 01:25:16.872
- Downtown's the other way.
- We're not going downtown.

01:25:16.981 --> 01:25:18.414
Where are we going?

01:25:20.751 --> 01:25:22.548
That bitch of yours is fine.

01:25:23.087 --> 01:25:25.078
- What?
- So is Washington's widow.

01:25:26.490 --> 01:25:28.390
You're fucking them both, huh?

01:25:29.593 --> 01:25:32.357
- Which one you feeling, Dante?
- I like Linda.

01:25:32.463 --> 01:25:34.954
You shouldn't have given her
the video, Lud.

01:25:35.266 --> 01:25:37.632
What the fuck were you thinking?

01:25:37.735 --> 01:25:39.464
You handed that bitch a death sentence.

01:25:39.570 --> 01:25:41.470
What the hell are you talking about?

01:25:41.572 --> 01:25:43.267
We've been watching you, asshole.

01:25:43.374 --> 01:25:46.537
How many times were you told
to let it go? Hmm? How many?

01:25:46.644 --> 01:25:47.736
Cool, homes. Don't get him going.

01:25:47.845 --> 01:25:50.143
Hey, fuck him!
Look what he's making us do.

01:25:50.247 --> 01:25:51.646
Smug fucking punk.

01:25:52.283 --> 01:25:53.944
Did you figure it out, Lud? Huh?

01:25:54.051 --> 01:25:56.645
How did Fremont and Coates make it
to the market that day?

01:25:56.754 --> 01:26:00.087
After Washington got them kicked loose,
you picked them back up.

01:26:00.191 --> 01:26:02.125
Took them to the hills
and popped their melons, right?

01:26:02.226 --> 01:26:05.127
You should be a detective.
We took some DNA samples first.

01:26:05.229 --> 01:26:08.960
Got a little hair, little spit. Voila!
Fremont and Coates did it.

01:26:09.066 --> 01:26:11.500
Who signed out the dope?
It wasn't Washington.

01:26:11.602 --> 01:26:12.626
You.

01:26:12.736 --> 01:26:13.896
They were gonna incinerate it.

01:26:14.004 --> 01:26:16.165
Might as well sell and make a dollar
out of it, you know?

01:26:16.273 --> 01:26:17.968
For you or the cookie jar?

01:26:23.514 --> 01:26:26.779
You're not that smart, Santos.
Who was in?

01:26:27.151 --> 01:26:28.448
Silky? Clady?

01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:37.157
Wander.

01:26:39.763 --> 01:26:41.060
Wander.

01:26:46.237 --> 01:26:48.535
It's a Wander caper all the way.

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:51.471
He's the only one
who could pull those strings.

01:26:51.575 --> 01:26:53.770
He should have pulled your string
years ago.

01:26:53.878 --> 01:26:56.210
We couldn't figure out why the fuck
he kept you around all this time.

01:26:56.313 --> 01:26:58.076
Man, he's Jack's little pet.

01:26:58.182 --> 01:27:00.616
Been doing the man's dirty missions
for years.

01:27:00.718 --> 01:27:03.186
Washington wasn't giving me up to Biggs.

01:27:05.656 --> 01:27:09.786
He was giving up the big dog.
He was giving up the king.

01:27:09.894 --> 01:27:13.660
Wander played your fool ass, puto.
We all have.

01:27:13.764 --> 01:27:15.561
You're a fucking chump, bro.

01:27:22.506 --> 01:27:25.031
Washington's killers, they really cops?

01:27:25.142 --> 01:27:26.166
Yeah, they were.

01:27:26.277 --> 01:27:28.905
Couple of deputies from the ghetto
having the time of their lives.

01:27:29.013 --> 01:27:30.037
And making us a lot of money.

01:27:30.147 --> 01:27:32.479
- They were supposed to punch your ticket.
- But you punched theirs.

01:27:32.583 --> 01:27:34.551
Yeah. Now we gotta punch yours.

01:27:34.985 --> 01:27:37.886
- Up in the hills.
- Up in the hills, brother.

01:27:37.988 --> 01:27:40.183
First, we bag your hair, saliva and blood.

01:27:40.291 --> 01:27:42.486
When they find
Linda Washington's corpse,

01:27:42.593 --> 01:27:44.584
guess whose DNA's gonna be all over it?

01:27:44.695 --> 01:27:47.129
And what is it gonna look like?

01:27:47.231 --> 01:27:50.428
Like you finally snapped,
just like everyone knew you would.

01:27:50.534 --> 01:27:52.195
That little nurse of yours, Lud?

01:27:52.303 --> 01:27:54.601
You know, I'm popping
a hundred milli Viagra

01:27:54.705 --> 01:27:57.139
and I'm gonna work that little brown ass.

01:27:58.042 --> 01:27:59.942
Then I'm gonna break her neck.

01:28:06.984 --> 01:28:10.442
Get that fucking cuff out of my mouth,
motherfucker! You...

01:28:12.389 --> 01:28:14.482
Get that piece of shit!

01:28:15.292 --> 01:28:20.252
Fuck you, motherfucker!
You little motherfucker!

01:28:23.334 --> 01:28:25.359
Shoot that motherfucker!

01:28:28.806 --> 01:28:29.795
Motherfucker!

01:28:42.845 --> 01:28:44.813
Well, hello there, handsome.

01:28:45.581 --> 01:28:47.344
Did you have a nice nap?

01:29:12.541 --> 01:29:14.873
Santos! Your girlfriend's getting away!

01:29:19.949 --> 01:29:21.416
What are you doing, Lud?

01:29:21.517 --> 01:29:23.849
You crawling to your own grave?

01:29:23.953 --> 01:29:25.181
Watch me play with this fool.

01:29:37.533 --> 01:29:38.795
Oh!

01:29:43.772 --> 01:29:44.898
Legger!

01:29:45.107 --> 01:29:46.074
Yeah!

01:29:48.944 --> 01:29:51.174
Who's the boy now, motherfucker? Huh?

01:29:52.214 --> 01:29:53.738
Homeboy's gonna bury himself.

01:29:53.849 --> 01:29:56.283
Just do the fucking puto and let's go.

01:30:07.896 --> 01:30:09.329
So this is it, Lud.

01:30:12.001 --> 01:30:14.993
- This is how it ends.
- DeMille, what the fuck? Let's go, bro!

01:30:15.104 --> 01:30:16.901
Shut up! I'm having fun!

01:31:06.989 --> 01:31:10.220
Where? Where is the fucking disc?

01:31:10.359 --> 01:31:11.417
Huh?

01:31:13.762 --> 01:31:15.093
Where's the disc?

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:32.572
Okay.

01:31:40.756 --> 01:31:42.053
Come here.

01:31:42.424 --> 01:31:46.258
You're a lot tougher than that
piece of shit husband you used to have.

01:31:47.663 --> 01:31:49.722
You're getting ahead of yourself.

01:31:52.034 --> 01:31:53.126
We're gonna be here all night.

01:32:06.882 --> 01:32:09.851
You have to go, Linda.
Wherever it is, you gotta go.

01:32:09.952 --> 01:32:10.941
Come on.

01:32:11.053 --> 01:32:12.748
I'm already packed.

01:32:13.956 --> 01:32:16.015
Take care of yourself, Detective.

01:32:22.631 --> 01:32:24.531
Where are you gonna go, cop killer?

01:32:43.318 --> 01:32:44.945
I let myself in.

01:32:46.955 --> 01:32:48.149
Clearly.

01:32:49.825 --> 01:32:52.316
You all right, Tom?
I was worried about you.

01:32:53.695 --> 01:32:56.892
Apparently, I killed two deputies.
Diskant's dead.

01:32:56.999 --> 01:33:00.366
Santos and DeMille dragged me off to die,
so I put them down.

01:33:02.171 --> 01:33:03.297
Can you fix this, Jack?

01:33:03.405 --> 01:33:05.373
Oh, I'm going to fix it. I'm going to fix it.

01:33:05.474 --> 01:33:07.942
You know, I suspected
that Santos and DeMille

01:33:08.043 --> 01:33:09.874
were capering with Washington,

01:33:09.978 --> 01:33:12.378
but I didn't want to believe
this kind of shit was going on in my unit.

01:33:12.481 --> 01:33:13.948
Yeah. Me neither.

01:33:14.616 --> 01:33:17.176
Boss, you better get Clady up here.
I need you guys.

01:33:17.286 --> 01:33:18.981
I'll get him in the loop.

01:33:19.521 --> 01:33:22.319
I'm gonna get him up here right now.
You need an alibi.

01:33:22.758 --> 01:33:27.058
You were sleeping
on the couch after the party.

01:33:28.130 --> 01:33:29.893
Santos and DeMille,
they killed those deputies.

01:33:29.998 --> 01:33:31.465
Not you. Not you.

01:33:46.048 --> 01:33:47.982
This is Clady's phone.

01:33:48.884 --> 01:33:50.511
And his badge.

01:33:51.587 --> 01:33:54.147
All this is you. It's you, Jack.

01:33:54.256 --> 01:33:56.383
It's you. It's you, Tom.

01:33:56.491 --> 01:33:58.686
Own it! Fucking own it!

01:33:59.261 --> 01:34:00.455
You knew they were cops!

01:34:00.562 --> 01:34:01.927
Those guys were so deep undercover

01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:04.021
that they... They lost their fucking minds!

01:34:04.132 --> 01:34:05.463
Don't mourn them. You can't mourn them.

01:34:05.567 --> 01:34:08.832
You set me up!
You sent me in to die, Jack!

01:34:08.937 --> 01:34:11.701
I didn't set you up! You set yourself up!

01:34:11.807 --> 01:34:15.038
I was trying to save you!
You backed me up in a fucking corner!

01:34:15.143 --> 01:34:17.611
- You killed Washington!
- Fuck him!

01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:21.541
Fuck Santos! Fuck DeMille!
Fuck Clady! Fuck them all!

01:34:22.084 --> 01:34:23.608
Fuck them all!

01:34:23.852 --> 01:34:25.649
They're a dime a dozen.

01:34:26.088 --> 01:34:27.214
You...

01:34:27.889 --> 01:34:29.186
You, man.

01:34:29.925 --> 01:34:31.222
You're special.

01:34:32.027 --> 01:34:33.392
You're special to me.

01:34:33.495 --> 01:34:34.792
And Diskant?

01:34:35.597 --> 01:34:37.064
He special?

01:34:37.733 --> 01:34:40.065
I watched a good man die because of you.

01:34:40.535 --> 01:34:42.833
That is entirely

01:34:43.672 --> 01:34:44.969
your fault.

01:34:45.674 --> 01:34:46.936
Come on, Tom.

01:34:47.509 --> 01:34:49.477
How do we get past this?

01:34:52.414 --> 01:34:55.178
We got a destiny. You and me.

01:34:57.386 --> 01:34:59.684
Nobody's getting past this, Jack.

01:35:00.188 --> 01:35:03.385
Everything ends now. You end now.

01:35:56.812 --> 01:35:58.677
I surrender! I surrender.

01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:01.544
Hook me and book me!

01:36:03.985 --> 01:36:06.180
There's a rover right there!

01:36:07.289 --> 01:36:10.087
Put it out! One for transport!

01:36:10.192 --> 01:36:14.151
Goddamn!
Tom Ludlow, he got his man now!

01:36:19.768 --> 01:36:21.395
I found you.

01:36:22.170 --> 01:36:24.638
I made you possible.

01:36:27.442 --> 01:36:30.070
Now you need me more than ever, Tom.

01:36:31.747 --> 01:36:34.614
What did you think I'd do
when I found out?

01:36:37.586 --> 01:36:40.453
Wait, man. Wait.

01:36:41.923 --> 01:36:43.288
Wait.

01:36:48.864 --> 01:36:50.161
My wall.

01:36:52.601 --> 01:36:55.069
It's all there. In the wall.

01:36:56.304 --> 01:36:58.499
These secrets, they're killing us.

01:37:06.348 --> 01:37:08.782
That's it. Open it up.

01:37:11.987 --> 01:37:14.353
Open it up! Tear it down!

01:37:28.136 --> 01:37:29.330
Tear it down!

01:37:35.710 --> 01:37:37.007
That's it.

01:37:41.249 --> 01:37:42.511
There it is.

01:37:51.293 --> 01:37:52.351
This

01:37:52.961 --> 01:37:54.588
is my power.

01:37:55.964 --> 01:37:58.728
This is my crown.

01:38:00.268 --> 01:38:02.133
I'm the king of secrets, Tom!

01:38:03.438 --> 01:38:05.633
I know which city councilman
is doing lines.

01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:08.368
I know who likes boys.
I know who's selling contracts.

01:38:08.477 --> 01:38:10.570
I know who... Who's beating his wife.

01:38:10.679 --> 01:38:14.775
I own them!
Even the Chief is in my pocket, Tom.

01:38:15.984 --> 01:38:20.512
How do you think that I've been able to
protect you all these years?

01:38:21.356 --> 01:38:23.824
What do you think it is that you're doing?

01:38:24.426 --> 01:38:26.053
All these missions,

01:38:28.196 --> 01:38:30.365
how do you think that you're able to touch
the untouchables?

01:38:30.365 --> 01:38:32.060
how do you think that you're able to touch
the untouchables?

01:38:33.034 --> 01:38:34.729
I'm gonna be chief!

01:38:35.704 --> 01:38:37.501
I will be chief!

01:38:37.806 --> 01:38:39.433
I will be mayor!

01:38:40.742 --> 01:38:42.733
This is our world, Tom!

01:38:43.712 --> 01:38:45.077
So, let's take it!

01:38:46.047 --> 01:38:48.072
That why you put a hit on Washington?

01:38:48.183 --> 01:38:50.174
Why you tried to kill me?

01:38:50.652 --> 01:38:53.086
So you can keep stuffing money
in your wall?

01:38:53.188 --> 01:38:54.985
But this is our money.

01:38:56.758 --> 01:38:58.055
The unit's.

01:38:59.494 --> 01:39:03.624
Who do you think paid for Silky's defense
during all those lawsuits?

01:39:06.101 --> 01:39:08.262
Who's gonna pay for your retirement?

01:39:09.437 --> 01:39:12.031
I'm just correcting a flaw
in the system, Tom.

01:39:12.741 --> 01:39:16.700
This is about cops helping cops.

01:39:17.946 --> 01:39:22.542
And if a teacher or a fireman could do it,

01:39:23.385 --> 01:39:25.012
they would do it, too.

01:39:28.089 --> 01:39:30.887
What happened to just locking up
bad people?

01:39:33.962 --> 01:39:36.260
We're all bad, Tom.

01:39:55.617 --> 01:39:57.744
You were my best friend.

01:40:03.592 --> 01:40:05.219
We were family.

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:40.118
Drop it, Ludlow!

01:40:51.172 --> 01:40:52.969
There's been enough killing.

01:40:57.979 --> 01:40:59.844
I came as soon as you called.

01:41:00.849 --> 01:41:02.942
Guess you're first on scene.

01:41:06.621 --> 01:41:08.748
Nope. You are.

01:41:16.464 --> 01:41:21.060
Looks like Jack's friends got greedy
and came after the money.

01:41:22.871 --> 01:41:25.032
- Is that what it looks like?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:41:28.109 --> 01:41:30.077
This is your plan, Captain?

01:41:30.812 --> 01:41:33.406
Just sit back and let us all kill each other?

01:41:34.282 --> 01:41:35.874
You were the plan.

01:41:38.653 --> 01:41:40.450
No one else could touch him.

01:41:41.356 --> 01:41:45.122
Once your eyes were opened,
there was no other outcome.

01:41:50.398 --> 01:41:52.229
Decisions were made, Tom,

01:41:52.834 --> 01:41:55.632
- by powerful men with powerful secrets.
- Captain.

01:41:57.539 --> 01:41:59.507
They were afraid of Jack.

01:41:59.674 --> 01:42:01.232
They asked me to help.

01:42:03.611 --> 01:42:08.446
One day, you will pass the Chief in the hall
and he will give you a nod.

01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:11.181
And you will know why.

01:42:14.489 --> 01:42:16.286
Because you were right, Tom.

01:42:17.759 --> 01:42:19.507
We do
need you.
