WEBVTT

00:08.259 --> 00:10.511
Add two more milliliters,

00:10.511 --> 00:12.473
add one more milliliter.

00:12.473 --> 00:14.225
Okay, perfect.

00:14.225 --> 00:17.598
This is the exact shade
of purple I'm trying
to find a purse in!

00:17.598 --> 00:20.441
That would so go with
your this color jacket.

00:22.233 --> 00:25.236
So, it's time to assign
lab partners.

00:25.236 --> 00:27.318
Oh, I call Shelbs.
We're awesome lab partners.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.320
Look how well this bag
goes with this jacket.

00:30.491 --> 00:33.614
Actually, I'm gonna
switch things up here.

00:33.614 --> 00:35.456
I need some juicy gossip.

00:35.456 --> 00:37.288
No one in the teacher's
lounge wants to hear

00:37.288 --> 00:39.250
about lab partners
who get along.

00:39.250 --> 00:41.622
Huh, all they want
to talk about is
Mrs. Jensen's new baby.

00:41.622 --> 00:43.504
I can't compete with that.

00:43.504 --> 00:47.298
Nobody thinks it's cute
when I take an underpants
picture in a flower basket.

00:48.669 --> 00:50.381
Cyd, you will be with Tim.

00:50.381 --> 00:52.383
Mr. Doyle, not Shy Tim.

00:56.517 --> 00:58.519
You can't even talk to him.

00:58.519 --> 01:00.311
He dropped his wallet once
and I tried

01:00.311 --> 01:02.563
to pick it up and
give it back to him
and he ran away.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.396
It was the easiest 20 bucks
I ever made.

01:05.396 --> 01:07.238
So, yeah, pair me
with Shy Tim.

01:08.529 --> 01:12.403
You know, rumor has it,
Shy Tim's a real
chatterbox at home.

01:12.403 --> 01:13.654
At least, that's what I heard.

01:16.197 --> 01:17.408
Okay, then.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.292
Man, Mr. Doyle
is way into gossip.

01:21.292 --> 01:24.335
Everyone knows,
Dishy Doyle loves
the hot goss.

01:24.335 --> 01:25.376
What are you talking about?

01:26.587 --> 01:28.669
I'm just wondering who
my lab partner is.

01:28.669 --> 01:31.512
Ah, I'm pairing
you with Rob,

01:31.512 --> 01:33.474
who says he can dunk,
but I've never seen it.

01:34.475 --> 01:35.636
Okay, then.

01:37.678 --> 01:41.272
Oh, not The Rob.
He's so obnoxious.

01:41.272 --> 01:43.644
Hey, Shel-bow
rhymes with elbow,

01:43.644 --> 01:46.317
Shelbo-elbow, the dweebo.

01:46.317 --> 01:47.358
That doesn't rhyme.

01:47.358 --> 01:49.440
Then you're Sheebo The Dweebo.

01:49.440 --> 01:53.194
(CHUCKLES) You got
a clown name. Look at me!

01:53.194 --> 01:54.655
I'm Sheebo. I'm a Dweebo.

01:56.327 --> 01:58.369
Better call the cops.
You just got robbed.

02:00.501 --> 02:02.413
Trade with me.
 I would,

02:02.413 --> 02:06.207
but Shy Tim's wallet's
starting to poke out
and I'm feelin' lucky.

allowing us to watch
movies at home

03:04.305 --> 03:06.477
during school hours simply
because we called it

03:06.477 --> 03:08.609
"Independent Cinema Studies"?

03:08.609 --> 03:10.441
I believe a lot of things
that happen.

03:10.441 --> 03:11.522
Thanks for asking.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.486
We're gonna have
so much fun tearing apart

03:15.486 --> 03:17.238
Spark Dynamo!

03:17.238 --> 03:18.489
How can anyone be dim enough

03:18.489 --> 03:22.283
to actually like a movie
about a space cowboy?

03:22.283 --> 03:24.455
You have the right
to remain space dust.

03:27.288 --> 03:29.420
I was charging my
Spark Dynamo belt buckle.

03:29.420 --> 03:32.253
SPARK: The bigger they are,
the harder they punch.

03:32.253 --> 03:34.385
That's physics!

03:34.385 --> 03:37.548
I love that you put on
that ridiculous costume

03:37.548 --> 03:39.640
to watch this
ridiculous movie.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.512
Are we watching
a ridiculous movie?

03:41.512 --> 03:43.434
I thought we were
watching Spark Dynamo.

03:43.434 --> 03:45.516
It's the movie that
both started and ended

03:45.516 --> 03:48.349
the space western
craze of January 1993.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.442
Wait, do you really
like this movie,

03:51.442 --> 03:53.274
or are you making fun of it?

03:53.274 --> 03:54.485
Why would we make
fun of it?

03:54.485 --> 03:56.317
It's the greatest movie
ever made,

03:56.317 --> 03:58.619
starring my favorite actor,
Vance Carroway.

03:58.619 --> 04:01.322
On the DVD commentary,
the director called him

04:01.322 --> 04:03.203
"the only actor
I could get,"

04:04.575 --> 04:07.418
and his mother called him,
"An interesting choice."

04:09.460 --> 04:12.293
Hiya, guys. Is this
the Independent
Cinema Studies?

04:12.293 --> 04:13.334
I almost walked
past it,

04:13.334 --> 04:14.545
but luckily
I kept my head up.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.427
It's like my grand cousin
Charlize says,

04:16.427 --> 04:19.380
"Always keep your head up
and your enemies closer."

04:21.302 --> 04:23.474
So how did you find out about
our little film group?

04:23.474 --> 04:27.227
We purposely didn't
tell anyone because...
Well, how can I say this

04:27.227 --> 04:29.480
without making it
sound bad?
It's a...

04:29.480 --> 04:31.522
Secret scam.
That's what you
called it, Barry.

04:31.522 --> 04:35.396
You also said not to tell
anyone, which is why
my lips are sealed.

04:37.237 --> 04:38.569
I heard about it
from Mr. Doyle.

04:38.569 --> 04:41.402
Ah man, Dishy Doyle
loves the hot goss.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.664
Marci, you're just in time.

04:43.664 --> 04:45.456
We're about to watch
 Spark Dynamo.

04:45.456 --> 04:46.617
Ooh, I've never seen that.

04:46.617 --> 04:50.210
Oh, it's the best.
 You really are
serious about this?

04:50.210 --> 04:52.212
You like that movie?
 Oh, I don't like it.

04:52.212 --> 04:53.374
Oh. Phew.
 I love it.

04:53.374 --> 04:57.297
Aw, shuds! As soon
as I said, "Phew"
I knew what was coming.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.470
Well, there's clearly only
one way to settle this.

04:59.470 --> 05:00.591
Fisticuffs?
 No,

05:00.591 --> 05:03.344
and I regret teaching
you that word.

05:03.344 --> 05:05.225
We will watch the movie
with Marci

05:05.225 --> 05:07.388
and let her judge
whether it's good or bad.

05:07.388 --> 05:09.480
The universe is expanding,

05:09.480 --> 05:12.312
so in a way, we're all
headed west.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.279
BOTH: There, see? I was right.

05:19.279 --> 05:20.491
I see your point.

05:21.402 --> 05:22.653
BOTH: Whose point?

05:27.538 --> 05:29.410
Who does Doyle
think he is,

05:29.410 --> 05:32.212
splitting me and Shelbs up
just to create some gossip?

05:32.212 --> 05:34.294
Shelby and I do
everything together.

05:34.294 --> 05:37.418
And Tim, you should be
with your girlfriend, Jane.

05:40.461 --> 05:42.633
And look at poor Shelby
over there.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.675
Someday you can tell
your kids, "Hey, kids,

05:44.675 --> 05:48.228
"I know you think
my life has been
one big pile of nothing,

05:48.228 --> 05:51.311
"but once in high school,
I was lab partners
with The Rob."

05:51.311 --> 05:53.524
Rob-five!

05:53.524 --> 05:55.646
Okay, look, we have
to do this together.

05:55.646 --> 05:58.278
Cool your jets, She-bo.
There's no together.
I'm way too hot for you.

05:59.530 --> 06:01.321
When I'm eighteen,
I'm getting a tattoo

06:01.321 --> 06:04.194
of my face on my face,
so I'll be twice
as good lookin'.

06:04.194 --> 06:05.616
Rob-pose.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.367
Rob, seriously...

06:07.367 --> 06:10.541
Hey, you should get
a tattoo of my face
on your face.

06:10.541 --> 06:11.622
It'll fix all that.

06:15.295 --> 06:18.208
Shelby, you don't have
to take this.
Slam him back!

06:18.208 --> 06:19.550
But I'm terrible at slams.

06:19.550 --> 06:21.381
Every time I say, "Yo, mama!",

06:21.381 --> 06:24.344
it always ends with
"is a very lovely lady."

06:24.344 --> 06:26.557
Hey Dwee-bo.
Let's try this on for size.

06:31.221 --> 06:33.644
Now you're lookin' fine.
What happened to you
over the summer?

06:38.278 --> 06:40.441
That's it. I'm gonna
drop him.
 No, no, no.

06:40.441 --> 06:42.402
I don't want you
to get in trouble
for me.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.484
I'll try to slam him back.

06:44.575 --> 06:46.657
Rob, you're so dumb,

06:46.657 --> 06:48.449
you left the light on
in the bathroom,

06:48.449 --> 06:50.451
even though
your mom told you
to turn it off.

06:50.451 --> 06:51.622
Why don't you
listen to your mama?

06:51.622 --> 06:53.454
She's a very lovely lady!

06:55.456 --> 06:57.458
Slam! Eat them eggs!

06:59.209 --> 07:00.501
Thanks for the eggs, Dwee-bo.

07:00.501 --> 07:04.635
The Rob loves eggs.
Num-num-num...
Rob-Blammo!

07:04.635 --> 07:08.639
(MIMICS FIRING GUN
AND EXPLOSION)

07:11.472 --> 07:14.475
See? I told you
I'm bad at slams.

07:14.475 --> 07:17.357
Mr. Doyle, this whole
lab partner pairing,

07:17.357 --> 07:19.319
is only for
today, right?
 Nope,

07:19.319 --> 07:20.481
this is for the rest
of the year.

07:20.481 --> 07:23.484
Ooh, I'm gonna get some
hot goss outta this.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.276
I'm gonna eat
Baby Jensen's lunch,

07:26.276 --> 07:29.239
which is strained peas
and apricots now.

07:29.239 --> 07:30.661
So, that, that's
kind of weird.

07:33.664 --> 07:35.245
Okay, then.

07:37.377 --> 07:40.250
How am I gonna get through
a whole year of The Rob?

07:40.250 --> 07:42.543
Slam him back.
It's the only way
to shut him up.

07:42.543 --> 07:44.505
But you just saw
how terrible I am at it.

07:44.505 --> 07:47.347
I'll train you.
We'll work on it
for as long as it takes.

07:47.347 --> 07:49.429
That's okay.
I'll just ignore him.

07:54.394 --> 07:57.518
I'm She-bo the Dwee-bo.

07:57.518 --> 08:00.440
(CHUCKLING) That's you.
That's what you sound like.

08:00.440 --> 08:01.602
Rob-personation.

08:04.605 --> 08:06.567

everything you know.

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:15.415 --> 08:17.618
All right, we're gonna
train you to out-slam The Rob.

08:17.618 --> 08:20.330
I'm forgoing all homework
to focus on this.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.292
You always forgo
all homework.

08:22.292 --> 08:24.334
Yeah, but this time,
it's to focus on this.

08:25.425 --> 08:27.628
You ready?
 I'm ready.

08:27.628 --> 08:30.300
I put Rob's face
on this punching bag.

08:32.432 --> 08:33.594
Let him have it.

08:33.594 --> 08:34.635
Let's do this.

08:36.557 --> 08:37.638
Meanie! Nerd!

08:39.229 --> 08:40.309
Hit him harder!

08:40.309 --> 08:42.563
Loser! Butt-face! Chump!

08:42.563 --> 08:45.525
Faster!
 Dork, dummy, doofus, dingus.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.487
You're stuck in the D's!
Get out of the D's!

08:48.609 --> 08:50.450
Jerk, Webelo!

08:50.450 --> 08:51.612
That's a Boy Scout!

08:53.203 --> 08:54.534
Goozit! Cheesle! Pigpop!

08:54.534 --> 08:56.456
Now you're just
making up words!

08:57.618 --> 09:00.370
Dork, jerk, butt-face,
loser, chump!

09:00.370 --> 09:02.372
Nice combination!
I think you're ready.

09:02.372 --> 09:04.424
Now, let's jump back
to this morning
and give it to him.

09:06.587 --> 09:08.258
Thanks for the eggs, Dwee-bo.

09:08.258 --> 09:10.591
The Rob loves eggs.
Num-num-num...

09:10.591 --> 09:13.303
Ew, next time you eat
eggs off my face,

09:13.303 --> 09:17.227
don't brush your teeth
with a dog's butt.
(CHUCKLING)

09:17.227 --> 09:20.270
Then stop wiping your butt
with my tooth brush.

09:20.270 --> 09:21.481
Standing Rob-vation!

09:23.443 --> 09:25.525
Uh, um...
 You're not ready,
you're not ready!

09:26.687 --> 09:29.650
You're so dumb,
all you can do
is lay eggs!

09:29.650 --> 09:32.402
Why am I yelling at a chicken?
 (CHICKEN CLUCKING)

09:32.402 --> 09:34.574
Chickens have the highest
self-esteem of any animal.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.327
If you can make a chicken cry,
you can take down anybody.

09:38.538 --> 09:41.461
Drum stick?
More like dumb stick!

09:44.374 --> 09:46.586
Is it working? Is it crying?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.508
Who knows, it's a chicken.

09:48.508 --> 09:49.630
Let's just go with yes.

09:51.471 --> 09:54.384
Then stop wiping your butt
with my tooth brush.

09:54.384 --> 09:56.266
Standing Rob-vation!
 (LAUGHTER)

09:57.217 --> 09:58.478
Well, your girlfriend called,

09:58.478 --> 10:00.480
she said, "Ooh, ooh,
ah, ah pick me up at eight."

10:02.482 --> 10:04.645
Yeah, well you can't even
call your boyfriend

10:04.645 --> 10:07.227
because he gave you
a fake phone number.

10:07.227 --> 10:08.689
(GASPS)
 (LAUGHTER)

10:08.689 --> 10:14.404
At least I got a phone.
Yours got disconnected.
(CHUCKLING)

10:17.577 --> 10:20.370
(WHIMPERING)

10:20.370 --> 10:22.372
Why didn't that work?
 You didn't say it right.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.584
You forgot the
"whaaat!" at the end.

10:27.337 --> 10:32.252
Yours got
disconnected. Whaaat!
 (LAUGHTER)

10:32.252 --> 10:34.384
Well, um, uh...
 Great comeback, slack jaw.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.426
You might want
to close your mouth.
The flies are gettin' out.

10:36.426 --> 10:38.428
Wha-what!

10:39.469 --> 10:41.471
Well, uh, I...

10:41.471 --> 10:43.223
I'm tired of looking at this.

10:43.223 --> 10:44.264
Shel-boom!

10:46.436 --> 10:48.268
The Rob's got better
things to do.

10:49.439 --> 10:50.530
The Rob out.

10:50.530 --> 10:53.533
(APPLAUSE)
 Shelby, you did it!

10:53.533 --> 10:55.275
You out-Robbed
The Rob!

10:55.275 --> 10:56.616
Shel-blamo!

10:56.616 --> 10:59.489
Yeah, I out-Robbed
The Rob.

10:59.489 --> 11:02.412
What's the matter?
This is what we've
been training for.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.584
I don't know.
It just doesn't feel

11:04.584 --> 11:06.416
as good as I thought
it would.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.288
I just got back
from the copy machine.

11:08.288 --> 11:10.630
I made this for baby
Jensen's face.

11:10.630 --> 11:12.552
That's what you kids
do now, right?

11:12.552 --> 11:14.294
You put your face
on other people's faces.

11:16.346 --> 11:17.427
Okay then.

11:21.561 --> 11:23.683
Okay, Barry, you think
 Spark Dynamo is terrible,

11:23.683 --> 11:25.645
and I think it's amazing.

11:25.645 --> 11:27.477
So I will recreate
the most epic action
scene in the movie

11:27.477 --> 11:28.478
to prove my point.

11:29.609 --> 11:32.232
Pew, pew, pew!
Grr, grr, grr!

11:32.232 --> 11:34.574
Pew, pew, pew!
Grr, grr, grr!

11:34.574 --> 11:37.407
Renaldo, you did it.
You proved it's
a great movie.

11:37.407 --> 11:39.409
Really?
 No!

11:39.409 --> 11:41.531
"Pew, pew, pew?
Grr, grr, grr?"

11:41.531 --> 11:43.203
And then what happens?

11:44.534 --> 11:46.246
All right, you presented
your evidence

11:46.246 --> 11:47.377
that Spark Dynamo is good,

11:47.377 --> 11:49.539
now I'll present
my evidence that it's bad.

11:49.539 --> 11:54.384
Meet the star of the movie,
Mr. Dynamo himself,
Vance Carroway.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.428
You have the right
to remain space dust!

12:00.470 --> 12:02.472
Oh, my gosh! Mr. Carroway,

12:02.472 --> 12:04.224
I can't believe you came
to our school.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.266
I'll do anything
for my fans. (CHUCKLES)

12:06.266 --> 12:08.398
Now, I heard there was
gonna be press here.

12:08.398 --> 12:10.560
Because I need publicity
so that I can crowd fund
my new movie,

12:11.441 --> 12:13.403
Crabnormal Behavior.

12:13.403 --> 12:15.525
It's about crabs
who ain't acting right.

12:17.277 --> 12:18.448
The press will be here later.

12:18.448 --> 12:20.320
I believe you have something
to tell my friend.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.202
Yes, for $50,

12:22.202 --> 12:23.573
you can get a tee shirt
with a crab on it.

12:23.573 --> 12:25.625
For $75, you can get a crab.

12:25.625 --> 12:28.288
For $100, I'll come
to your house,
I'll cook the crab.

12:30.420 --> 12:33.333
I'll give you $150
if you say that thing
we talked about.

12:33.333 --> 12:36.296
Absolutely, my new
Associate Producer.

12:38.378 --> 12:43.223
Spark Dynamo
 is the worst movie
ever made.

12:43.223 --> 12:46.306
I don't understand.
You came here
dressed as Spark Dynamo.

12:46.306 --> 12:47.437
Uh, you were so good in it.

12:47.437 --> 12:49.559
You're right, I was.

12:49.559 --> 12:52.392
But the material
wasn't nearly up
to my talent.

12:52.392 --> 12:54.444
See, I'm a classically
trained actor.

12:54.444 --> 12:58.238
I could have been
Marcus Antonius saying,

12:58.238 --> 13:01.531
"Cry havoc and let slip
the dogs of war,"

13:01.531 --> 13:04.364
instead of
Spark Dynamo saying,

13:04.364 --> 13:07.457
"Cry havoc and let slip
the space dogs
of space war."

13:09.209 --> 13:10.540
Wait a minute,
that is very similar.

13:13.623 --> 13:15.625
They stole Spark Dynamo
 from Shakespeare!

13:18.628 --> 13:22.342
Well, if Vance Carroway
says it's a terrible movie,

13:23.223 --> 13:24.634
I guess it is.

13:24.634 --> 13:27.557
You win, Barry.
You were right.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.309
Wait, Renaldo,
where are you going?

13:29.309 --> 13:31.561
We still have to pick
the next movie
for cinema studies!

13:31.561 --> 13:33.313
And remember Renaldo,

13:33.313 --> 13:35.395
in the words
of Spark Dynamo,

13:35.395 --> 13:37.487
"Follow the yellow
brick splart!"

13:37.487 --> 13:39.609
Which is stolen from...

13:39.609 --> 13:42.362
Oh, you're kiddin' me.
How did I not put
that together?

13:48.248 --> 13:49.659
Thanks, but I'm not hungry.

13:49.659 --> 13:52.662
Oh, did you think...
Yeah, right.

13:52.662 --> 13:55.415
One of these was
for you.

13:55.415 --> 13:57.547
But I guess if you
don't want it,
I could eat 'em both.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.342
I thought taking down
The Rob would feel great,

14:02.342 --> 14:03.633
but I still feel bad.

14:03.633 --> 14:06.556
Don't worry about The Rob.
He slams people non-stop.

14:06.556 --> 14:08.348
All you did was slam back.

14:08.348 --> 14:12.312
That's just it.
I don't want to be
like The Rob. He's a jerk.

14:12.312 --> 14:13.473
What's his problem anyway?

14:14.604 --> 14:16.476
What are we talkin' about?
The Rob?

14:18.238 --> 14:19.689
He was a nice guy
in middle school

14:19.689 --> 14:21.441
until that girl
broke his heart.

14:21.441 --> 14:22.532
A girl broke his heart?

14:22.532 --> 14:25.285
Last Valentine's Day.
Right here in this commons.

14:25.285 --> 14:26.616
The Rob put his
heart out there,

14:26.616 --> 14:29.619
and some ice-cold Felicia
shoved it back in his face.

14:30.660 --> 14:32.452
At least that's what I heard.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.631
So, The Rob's a jerk because

14:41.631 --> 14:43.673
some ice-cold Felicia
broke his heart.

14:43.673 --> 14:48.218
Well, that's it.
We can jump back and
keep that from happening.

14:48.218 --> 14:49.509
The Rob won't become a jerk

14:49.509 --> 14:51.641
and I won't have
to feel like a jerk.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.513
This is perfect, Cyd.

14:53.513 --> 14:56.356
I want to use time travel
to help people,
not to hurt them.

15:00.230 --> 15:01.571
SHELBY: All right,
there he is.

15:01.571 --> 15:03.523
Now, let's watch and see
which girl he goes up to

15:03.523 --> 15:05.445
and that's
the ice-cold Felicia.

15:05.445 --> 15:08.368
Then we'll figure out
some way to stop her
from breaking his heart.

15:08.368 --> 15:11.331
To turn Rob into The Rob,
she must've been horrible.

15:11.331 --> 15:13.293
I can't even imagine
what kind of

15:13.293 --> 15:16.336
sick, twisted
monster she is.

15:16.336 --> 15:17.627
Excuse me, Shelby,
these are yours.

15:17.627 --> 15:19.419
No, those aren't mine.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.541
But I just wanted to...
 Give them
to the girl you like.

15:21.541 --> 15:23.423
I'm rooting for you, buddy.

15:26.636 --> 15:29.599
Um, Shelby.
 Ooh, I wanna see
which girl it is.

15:36.316 --> 15:39.269
Oh, I'm the ice-cold Felicia.

15:50.410 --> 15:52.492
SPARK: It's always
high noon on the sun!

15:53.623 --> 15:55.625
Well, I can't argue with that.

15:57.537 --> 15:59.499
Hiya, Barry.
 Sorry, Marci.

15:59.499 --> 16:01.251
There's no more
cinema studies.

16:01.251 --> 16:03.213
Renaldo got all sad
and then quit,

16:03.213 --> 16:05.465
and why are you
wearing a skirt made
out of garbage?

16:05.465 --> 16:06.586
It's a new thing
I'm trying out.

16:06.586 --> 16:08.678
Clothes made out of garbage.

16:08.678 --> 16:11.301
My underpants are
half a watermelon rind

16:11.301 --> 16:12.512
with a couple of leg holes
cut in it.

16:12.512 --> 16:14.474
You might think
it's weird, but I like it.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.648
You can't possibly like it.
 But I do.

16:18.648 --> 16:20.360
But you can't.
 But I do.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.401
But you can't.
 But I do.

16:21.401 --> 16:22.652
But you can't?
 But I do.

16:22.652 --> 16:24.274
But you can't?
 But I do.

16:24.274 --> 16:25.365
But you do.

16:26.526 --> 16:28.568
This is just what happened
with me and Renaldo.

16:28.568 --> 16:32.282
It's not about
whether the movie
is good or bad.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.374
If he likes it,
that's all that matters.

16:34.374 --> 16:36.416
Thank you, Marci,
for opening my eyes.

16:36.416 --> 16:37.457
But I didn't.
 But you did.

16:37.457 --> 16:38.578
But I didn't.
 I'm not doing this.

16:38.578 --> 16:40.380
But you are.
 No!

16:53.303 --> 16:54.634
You really didn't miss
out on much.

16:54.634 --> 16:56.396
These are all coconut.

16:58.268 --> 17:00.480
I can't believe I'm the one
who broke The Rob's heart

17:00.480 --> 17:01.601
and turned him
into a jerk.

17:01.601 --> 17:03.523
How did you not know
when he originally

17:03.523 --> 17:05.484
came up to you
and offered you chocolates?

17:05.484 --> 17:08.278
He said they were mine.
Like I dropped them
or something.

17:08.278 --> 17:11.411
You know I can never tell
if a boy likes me.

17:11.411 --> 17:14.414
Hey, Ryan. Some lucky girl's
really gonna like those, huh?

17:17.416 --> 17:20.210
So, what are you gonna
do about The Rob?

17:20.210 --> 17:23.333
I'll just thank him
for the chocolates,
let him down easy

17:23.333 --> 17:26.215
so his feelings aren't hurt,
and everything will be fine.

17:26.215 --> 17:27.507
We're going out
this Saturday.

17:29.259 --> 17:31.261
Oh, Shelby, you didn't.

17:31.261 --> 17:33.633
He was so sad
and it made him so happy.

17:33.633 --> 17:36.516
And it's just one date.
And we can jump
back to the present

17:36.516 --> 17:37.597
so I can skip over it.

17:37.597 --> 17:39.349
It's like it never happened.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.523
Phew, I hope that worked.
 Shelby...

17:44.524 --> 17:46.356
(READING)

17:47.687 --> 17:49.449
Yeah, you are, Shel-baby.

17:51.241 --> 17:53.283
Let me eat some of those
sweet kisses off your face.

17:53.283 --> 17:55.535
(KISSES)

17:56.496 --> 17:59.329
Girl, you are
Rob-dorable!

18:00.330 --> 18:02.332
(SOBBING) What have I done?

18:06.626 --> 18:08.628
I really like
that garbage skirt.

18:08.628 --> 18:10.210
Can you make
something for me?

18:10.210 --> 18:12.262
I do have another
half a watermelon.

18:12.262 --> 18:14.304
Sweet. I could use
some new underpants.

18:15.675 --> 18:19.269
So Barry said you should
walk through there.

18:19.269 --> 18:22.602
Whoa, this place looks
just like the Comet Cantina

18:22.602 --> 18:24.314
from Spark Dynamo.

18:26.276 --> 18:28.318
You have the right
to remain space dust.

18:29.689 --> 18:33.323
Barry? You look just like...
 That's right. Spark Dynamo.

18:33.323 --> 18:36.446
SPARK:
 If I eat any more beans,
I'll be a gas giant!

18:38.238 --> 18:39.539
Do you like
 Spark Dynamo now?

18:39.539 --> 18:41.581
No, no. Oh, heavens, no.

18:41.581 --> 18:45.245
It's a turd. But I was wrong

18:45.245 --> 18:46.586
for not letting you
enjoy that turd.

18:48.338 --> 18:50.420
I'm sorry.
 Thanks for dressing up

18:50.420 --> 18:51.631
so awesome just for me.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.633
No, I'm humiliating myself
just for you.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.305
Well, I think
it's pretty awesome.

18:56.306 --> 18:57.557
In the words of Spark Dynamo,

18:57.557 --> 18:59.639
"Here's looking
at you, Zorblob."

19:02.392 --> 19:04.684
That goat keeps
eyein' my garbage skirt.

19:04.684 --> 19:06.526
And why is there a goat
in here anyway?

19:06.526 --> 19:08.318
It's a terrible movie!

19:10.360 --> 19:14.324
I can't believe I've been
dating The Rob
since Valentine's Day.

19:14.324 --> 19:17.367
I can't believe
there's a Space Cantina
in the commons.

19:17.367 --> 19:19.369
I'll have two of whatever
the goat's having.

19:24.584 --> 19:27.457
I don't know what to do.
I don't want to hurt him.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.289
I guess I'm gonna have
to stay with him.

19:29.289 --> 19:31.291
We'll get married
and have two kids

19:31.291 --> 19:33.253
named Little The Rob
and Little The Roberta.

19:33.253 --> 19:34.634
And every morning,
I'll make them eggs

19:34.634 --> 19:36.636
but they'll want to
eat them off my face
because The Rob loves eggs!

19:38.638 --> 19:41.641
Okay, maybe I was wrong
to encourage you to slam him,

19:41.641 --> 19:43.353
'cause that's not you.

19:43.353 --> 19:45.475
But you shouldn't be
dating him, either.

19:45.475 --> 19:48.358
Yeah, you know what?
You're right.

19:48.358 --> 19:51.401
I'll just be nice
and tell him,
I can't date him.

19:51.401 --> 19:53.443
Shelby.
 Rob, we need to talk.

19:53.443 --> 19:55.405
Me, first. I'm dumping you.

19:57.277 --> 19:59.279
What?
 You know, I was eating
those kisses

19:59.279 --> 20:00.660
off your face and realized
I was just fakin' it.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.322
So The Rob is out!

20:04.324 --> 20:06.376
And I'm gonna need
that shirt back.

20:06.376 --> 20:08.458
I wanna give it to this little
firecracker over here.

20:10.420 --> 20:12.252
(CHUCKLES)
 (GROANS)

20:12.252 --> 20:14.294
The Rob down.
The Rob down.

20:16.215 --> 20:20.340
So pretty much in any
timeline, The Rob
turns into a jerk.

20:20.340 --> 20:21.601
Yep, not your fault.

20:21.601 --> 20:24.474
Then, can we go back
and erase the timeline
where I dated him?

20:24.474 --> 20:26.396
That's what
I'm smackin' about!

20:28.348 --> 20:29.479
(LASERS ZAPPING)

20:38.278 --> 20:41.531
Quasar Kid!
Who did this to you?

20:46.286 --> 20:49.369
Pew, pew, pew, pew!

20:49.369 --> 20:54.253
You know, Captain Capricorn,
I think you and I are
gonna be goat friends.

20:55.214 --> 20:57.216
(BLEATS)
 (LAUGHS)

20:57.216 --> 20:58.378
You said it, buddy.

21:01.641 --> 21:03.433
(GROWLING)
 Pew, pew, pew, pew!

21:11.270 --> 21:12.692
I love this movie.

21:12.692 --> 21:14.524
But it's terrible.

21:16.235 --> 21:17.657
Then you're gonna hate this.

21:22.201 --> 21:24.324
Something's wrong.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.455
Those crabs
ain't acting right.

21:27.367 --> 21:30.289
(MAN READING)
