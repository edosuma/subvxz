{\an1}I GOT A RAPID HEARTBEAT FROM
HIS KRUSTY BRAND VITAMINS.

17:36.320 --> 17:39.350
{\an1}MY KRUSTY CALCULATOR DIDN'T HAVE
\h\h\h\h\hA SEVEN OR AN EIGHT.

17:39.420 --> 17:41.160
{\an1}KRUSTY'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY WAS
\h\h\h\hSELF-SERVING

17:41.220 --> 17:42.620
{\an1}WITH MANY GLARING OMISSIONS.

17:42.690 --> 17:44.960
{\an1}BUT THIS TIME,
HE'S GONE TOO FAR.

17:45.030 --> 17:46.860
{\an1}WE WANT KRUSTY!

17:46.930 --> 17:50.460
{\an1}( <i>all chanting: )
WE WANT KRUSTY!

17:50.530 --> 17:52.330
{\an1}YEAH, WE WANT KRUSTY.

{\an1}( <i>all: )
WE WANT KRUSTY!</i>

17:53.800 --> 17:56.670
{\an1}I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU BROKE THEIR SPIRITS.

17:56.740 --> 17:58.010
{\an1}WE DID.

17:58.070 --> 17:59.140
{\an1}YOU BROKE NOTHING.

17:59.210 --> 18:00.340
{\an1}Bart:
LET'S GET 'EM!

18:00.410 --> 18:01.740
{\an1}TO THE HYDROFOIL.

18:01.810 --> 18:04.380
{\an1}( <i>angry shouting )</i>

18:10.720 --> 18:11.920
{\an1}MY CHUNKY BROTHERS

18:11.990 --> 18:14.220
{\an1}\h\h\h\hGORGE YOURSELVES
AT THE TROUGH OF FREEDOM.

18:16.520 --> 18:20.930
{\an1}OH, SWEET, NOURISHING GRUEL!

18:21.000 --> 18:22.670
{\an1}KOWALSKI!

18:22.730 --> 18:24.060
{\an1}MY BROWNIES!

18:24.130 --> 18:25.170
{\an1}WIGGUM.

18:25.230 --> 18:26.830

18:26.900 --> 18:28.270
{\an1}CRANDALL.

18:28.340 --> 18:29.800
{\an1}MY INSULIN!

18:34.780 --> 18:37.640
{\an1}BART, YOU SAID YOU'RE GONNA
NAME IT CAMP FREEDOM.

18:37.710 --> 18:40.080
{\an1}AH, THIS HAS MORE ZING.

18:40.150 --> 18:42.380
{\an1}I DUB THEE SIR...

18:42.450 --> 18:44.820
{\an1}URGENT CALL
FOR MR. KLOWN.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.690
{\an1}THIS BETTER BE IMPORTANT.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.220
{\an1}<i>OY GEVALT!</i>

18:48.290 --> 18:51.020
{\an1}Just let your head flop
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hback and forth.

18:51.090 --> 18:55.400
{\an1}Your neck is a well-cooked
piece of asparagus.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.660
{\an1}\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWe interrupt
Surdrudinma Baradad's yoga party

18:57.730 --> 18:59.470

19:02.340 --> 19:03.500
{\an1}Ladies and gentlemen

19:03.570 --> 19:05.870
{\an1}I've been to Vietnam,
Afghanistan and Iraq

19:05.940 --> 19:08.040
{\an1}and I can say without hyperbole

19:08.110 --> 19:12.080
{\an1}this is a million times worse
than all of them put together.

19:12.150 --> 19:15.750
{\an1}Burn, Krusty, burn!
Burn, Krusty, burn!

19:15.820 --> 19:17.990
{\an1}\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hA group
of school-age Spartacuses

19:18.050 --> 19:19.950
{\an1}has taken this camp by force.

{\an1}Three counselors are missing
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hand presumed scared.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.620
{\an1}What's that?

19:23.690 --> 19:27.030
{\an1}I'm being told I can have
an exclusive interview

19:27.090 --> 19:28.460
{\an1}with the ringleader.

19:28.530 --> 19:30.730
{\an1}<i>DON'T BE THE BOY.
DON'T BE THE BOY.</i>

19:33.270 --> 19:34.640
{\an1}D-OHH!

19:37.470 --> 19:41.210
{\an1}I want the whole world to know
this was a really crappy camp.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.040
{\an1}Can I say "crappy" on TV?

19:43.110 --> 19:44.440
{\an1}Yes, on this network you can.

19:47.110 --> 19:49.680
{\an1}IS IT TRUE
YOU ATTEMPTED SUICIDE
WHEN YOU HEARD THE NEWS?

19:49.750 --> 19:52.020
{\an1}ARE YOU AND PRINCESS DI
JUST FRIENDS?

19:52.090 --> 19:53.250
{\an1}YOU PEOPLE MAKE ME SICK!
YOU'RE VULTURES!

19:53.320 --> 19:56.460
{\an1}WHERE WERE YOU WHEN I SANG
\h\h\h\hAT FARM AID?

19:56.520 --> 19:58.660
{\an1}OUT OF MY WAY, YOU PARASITES.

20:01.030 --> 20:02.600
{\an1}<i>I'M NO FAKE.</i>

20:02.660 --> 20:05.000
{\an1}I'M THE REAL KRUSTY.

20:05.070 --> 20:08.100
{\an1}OH, YEAH?
WHO PLAYED YOUR DAUGHTER
ON THE SHORT-LIVED SITCOM

20:08.170 --> 20:09.200
{\an1}<i>PRESIDENT CLOWN?</i>

20:09.270 --> 20:11.040

20:11.110 --> 20:12.850
{\an1}BUT SHE HELD UP A LIQUOR STORE
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hLAST YEAR.

20:12.910 --> 20:14.110
{\an1}I SMELL BACON.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.020
{\an1}LET'S SEE IF HE'S
WEARING A WIRE.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.340
{\an1}HEY, WHOA!

20:17.410 --> 20:19.410
{\an1}NOT THE FACE.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.110
{\an1}Lisa:
IT <i>IS THE REAL KRUSTY.</i>

20:21.180 --> 20:23.080
{\an1}LOOK AT THAT PACEMAKER SCAR.

20:23.150 --> 20:24.750
{\an1}THE CATTLE SKULL BIRTHMARK

20:24.820 --> 20:26.820
{\an1}AND HIS FAMOUS
SUPERFLUOUS NIPPLE.

20:26.890 --> 20:28.790
{\an1}WELL, AT LEAST
YOU'RE NOT AS BAD AS CUSTOMS.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.120
{\an1}HOW COULD YOU, KRUSTY?

20:30.190 --> 20:33.090
{\an1}I'D NEVER LEND MY NAME
TO AN INFERIOR PRODUCT.

20:33.160 --> 20:35.100
{\an1}( <i>hysterical sobbing )</i>

20:35.160 --> 20:39.400
{\an1}THEY DROVE A DUMP TRUCK
FULL OF MONEY TO MY HOUSE.

20:39.470 --> 20:42.440
{\an1}I'M NOT MADE OF STONE.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.370
{\an1}KRUSTY, THIS CAMP
WAS A NIGHTMARE.

20:44.440 --> 20:45.510
{\an1}THEY FED US GRUEL.

20:45.570 --> 20:47.110
{\an1}THEY FORCED US TO MAKE
WALLETS FOR EXPORT

20:47.170 --> 20:49.540
{\an1}AND ONE OF THE CAMPERS
WAS EATEN BY A BEAR.

20:49.610 --> 20:52.550
{\an1}OH, MY GOD!

20:52.610 --> 20:54.250
{\an1}ACTUALLY, THE BEAR
JUST ATE HIS HAT.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.990
{\an1}\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWAS IT A NICE HAT?
OH, YEAH.
