WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:03.936
- Previously
on "All Stars,"

00:03.938 --> 00:08.040
I will not be eliminating
any queens this season.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.676
- What?
- What?

00:10.678 --> 00:14.480
- This season,
you'll be eliminating

00:14.482 --> 00:15.681
each other.

00:17.618 --> 00:18.784
The winner of the lip sync

00:18.786 --> 00:22.287
will eliminate
one of the bottom queens.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.261
- That was a choice.

00:29.263 --> 00:33.165
- ¶ We're gonna make love
to the clap tonight ¶

00:33.167 --> 00:36.001
- Girl, find the note.

00:36.003 --> 00:37.870
- I didn't hate your hair.

00:37.872 --> 00:38.971
- I did it myself.

00:38.973 --> 00:40.539
- That shows
you've done something.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.075
I don't care if you're gonna
give me your hog body line

00:43.077 --> 00:45.778
or whatever it is.
- Oh, my God.

00:45.780 --> 00:48.213
- It's just--
I expected more for you.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.883
- Roxxxy Andrews.

00:50.885 --> 00:52.818
You're a winner, baby.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.386
(applause)

00:54.388 --> 00:59.291
You've earned a cash tip
of $10,000.

00:59.293 --> 01:03.595
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

01:03.597 --> 01:05.764
- I won money
and I might lose a friend,

01:05.766 --> 01:07.933
but the girl
that I chose...

01:10.104 --> 01:11.303
Is Coco.

01:12.406 --> 01:16.075
- Coco Montrese,
sashay away.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.187
- Bitch.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.689
- Coco.
- Oh...

01:30.691 --> 01:35.160
- I'm very torn about
winning these lip syncs.

01:35.162 --> 01:37.596
Having to pick these girls
week by week

01:37.598 --> 01:39.064
is going to be so hard,

01:39.066 --> 01:41.333
but I also came here
to play the game, so...

01:41.335 --> 01:44.036
- Bye, Coquita.

01:44.038 --> 01:45.671
- Well, this is definitely
"All Stars."

01:45.673 --> 01:48.774
Tatianna,
who was your choice?

01:48.776 --> 01:52.377
- It was, um,
it was Coco also.

01:52.379 --> 01:55.614
I didn't think
she represented herself

01:55.616 --> 01:56.915
to the best
of her abilities.

01:56.917 --> 02:00.018
Giving the winner
of the lip sync

02:00.020 --> 02:03.188
the power to send one
of the bottom people home

02:03.190 --> 02:04.723
changes
the whole competition.

02:04.725 --> 02:08.494
I feel like now I have to
not only impress Ru,

02:08.496 --> 02:11.497
but also impress
my competitors.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.765
It's not fun.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.235
- This is a fucking doozy
and it's just starting.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.769
- Just starting.
- Just starting.

02:17.771 --> 02:20.172
- When she said safe,
I was like, okay, bitch.

02:20.174 --> 02:21.940
So then they gave her
her critiques.

02:21.942 --> 02:24.276
I said, well, damn.
- Yeah.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.478
- I'm glad I got my one-way
ticket to the back room.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.147
- Exactly.
- Like, we were back there,

02:28.149 --> 02:30.415
like, Jesus, they're
going the fuck in.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.550
- And they were poking,
bitch,

02:31.552 --> 02:33.385
just like every little
wrong thing,

02:33.387 --> 02:35.454
they got everybody for.

02:35.456 --> 02:38.357
- It's become immediately
very clear,

02:38.359 --> 02:40.659
this is "All Stars."
This is gonna be hard.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.061
There's so much talent
in this one room,

02:43.063 --> 02:45.831
this is gonna be
something to see.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.966
- Every time.
- Whoo-whee!

02:47.968 --> 02:49.635
- You know, coming
in this competition,

02:49.637 --> 02:51.069
you think you can prepare.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.938
It's like everything
you thought you knew

02:52.940 --> 02:54.573
flies out the window

02:54.575 --> 02:56.608
while you're
going 90 on the highway.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.845
- We're still here and we get
to send people home next week.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.380
- Who would you
have sent home?

03:01.382 --> 03:03.482
- I thought
I would've chosen Phi Phi.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.817
- I don't know, man.

03:05.819 --> 03:06.885
- I don't, either.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.253
I don't know
if I could do it.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.022
- Ru gave us
a responsibility.

03:10.024 --> 03:12.324
As the competition
progresses,

03:12.326 --> 03:13.458
it's going to get
more difficult.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.194
And could it be
one of those situations

03:15.196 --> 03:17.462
where you scratch my back,
I'll scratch yours?

03:17.464 --> 03:19.998
It's going to be interesting
to see how this turns out.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.134
Baby, this is "All Stars."

03:22.136 --> 03:23.835
Game on.

03:29.143 --> 03:31.910
- The winner of "RuPaul's
Drag Race All Stars"

03:31.912 --> 03:33.478
receives a one-year supply

03:33.480 --> 03:35.847
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics,

03:35.849 --> 03:38.417
a coveted spot in the
"Drag Race" hall of fame,

03:38.419 --> 03:42.154
and a cash prize
of $100,000.

03:42.156 --> 03:44.389
- ¶ Drag race,
May the best woman ¶

03:44.391 --> 03:47.025
¶ Best woman win ¶

03:50.397 --> 03:53.298
- The category is
Bundt cake.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.733
(all laugh)

03:54.735 --> 03:56.668
- It's a new day
and I've been able

03:56.670 --> 03:58.737
to kind of sleep
on everything.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.173
This new power that we're
given, it changes everything.

04:01.175 --> 04:06.011
It's like fucking drag
survivor, so nobody's safe.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.412
No one.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.548
- Tatianna said like this.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.483
Tatianna,
here's Tatianna.

04:11.485 --> 04:14.519
- And choices. Choices.

04:14.521 --> 04:18.423
- I'm still feeling a bit burned
from the judges' feedback.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.326
I'm feeling sideswiped

04:21.328 --> 04:24.329
and I'm not liking
how I'm feeling.

04:24.331 --> 04:27.566
(alarm)
- Ooh!

04:27.568 --> 04:30.602
- She's already
done had hers.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.638
- Hey, queens.
- Hey.

04:32.640 --> 04:36.141
- Now, I brought you here
because you are all stars.

04:36.143 --> 04:39.077
But now,
I want all new stars.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.380
Don't worry,
it's not personal.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.248
It's drag.

04:43.250 --> 04:46.351
So who else you got, huh?

04:48.722 --> 04:49.821
Hello, hello, hello.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.857
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.959
- I'm giving you all
Mini Mouse.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.496
- Ladies, here in Hollywood,
all the biggest celebs

04:57.498 --> 05:00.999
know that the key to
longevity is reinvention.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.302
So for this week's
maxi challenge,

05:03.304 --> 05:06.705
you get to reinvent
yourselves all over again

05:06.707 --> 05:11.943
because it's time
for an "All Star" edition

05:11.945 --> 05:14.746
of Snatch Game.

05:14.748 --> 05:18.150
#SnatchGameAllStars.

05:18.152 --> 05:21.653
- Oh, my God.
Snatch Game already.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.588
- It's like Christmas
came early.

05:23.590 --> 05:24.790
Oh, God,
I can't even say it.

05:24.792 --> 05:25.824
I'm not even gonna say that.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.893
I was gonna make
a joke about--

05:27.895 --> 05:31.430
- Gentlemen,
start your engines,

05:31.432 --> 05:34.866
and may the best woman win.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.836
(all laugh)
Come on, okay.

05:40.874 --> 05:45.277
- This is the snatchety snatch
snatch, snatch, snatch, snatch.

05:45.279 --> 05:46.778
- Who are you doing?
- Teresa Caputo.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.680
- I was also
going to do Teresa--

05:48.682 --> 05:51.049
I'm going to do, um...
- She's like...

05:51.051 --> 05:52.284
- I'm doing Teresa Caputo.

05:52.286 --> 05:55.053
- All right,
battle of the Teresas.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.621
- And you?
- Mae West.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.690
Who are you doing?
- I'm going to do Bjork.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.392
- Oh, right.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.828
- "All Star" Snatch Game
gives the chance

06:02.830 --> 06:06.565
for those who bombed in their
season to really stand out.

06:06.567 --> 06:10.369
So Alyssa, Detox and Phi Phi
have a lot of work to do.

06:10.371 --> 06:12.571
- Girl, the last minute
Snatch Game fucking sucked.

06:12.573 --> 06:15.507
In Season 4, I sucked
on the Snatch Game.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.808
¶ Work it, girl ¶

06:16.810 --> 06:20.412
¶ Give a twirl, give a twirl,
give a twirl ¶

06:20.414 --> 06:22.013
So this challenge
is important.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.782
- I think I'm gonna do
Nancy Grace.

06:23.784 --> 06:24.950
I think that'll be fun.

06:24.952 --> 06:27.285
It'll be something
different for me.

06:27.287 --> 06:30.055
It's super important
for me to do very well

06:30.057 --> 06:33.625
because I shit on myself,
pretty much,

06:33.627 --> 06:34.860
the last time around.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.862
- You're at the Snatch Game,
honey.

06:36.864 --> 06:37.929
- What's that?

06:39.400 --> 06:41.266
- So the pressure
is very high.

06:41.268 --> 06:42.868
- You're doing
Joan Crawford.

06:42.870 --> 06:43.869
- Yeah.
- Joan Crawfish.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.037
- Ms. Mommy Dearest.
- Yes, God.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.039
- Now, can talk like Joan
without your accent?

06:48.041 --> 06:50.442
- I think you should leave
the accent.

06:50.444 --> 06:53.845
- I've fought worst monsters
for years in Hollywood.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.848
(all laugh)

06:56.850 --> 06:59.684
- Alyssa's got to redeem herself
from the Katy Perry.

06:59.686 --> 07:00.786
- Have you ever
kissed a girl?

07:00.788 --> 07:03.054
- Oh! Rue, never.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.990
- But, uh, yeah.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.792
- 'Cause it's either
going to be a train wreck

07:06.794 --> 07:10.295
or it's gonna be a fun,
hilarious train.

07:10.297 --> 07:11.730
It's gonna be a train wreck
regardless.

07:11.732 --> 07:15.500
- Who did you--oh, you won
the Snatch Game in your season.

07:15.502 --> 07:17.569
- I won the first ever
Snatch Game.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.337
- Oh, so you think
you're somebody.

07:19.339 --> 07:21.440
- A little bit.
A little bit.

07:21.442 --> 07:23.809
My Britney Spears
got me far.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.377
- Britney,
Dumb Dee Dee's so dumb,

07:25.379 --> 07:27.446
last night she got arrested
for driving without a...

07:27.448 --> 07:29.181
- A baby in her lap.

07:29.183 --> 07:30.449
- (laughs)

07:30.451 --> 07:31.983
- Do you feel like
you have more pressure now

07:31.985 --> 07:33.385
that you already won?

07:33.387 --> 07:34.753
- Um, a little bit,

07:34.755 --> 07:36.955
but I'm trying not to even
get in that mindset.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.990
- Yeah.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.027
- Should have let her know,
bitch,

07:42.029 --> 07:43.395
that was unintentional,
darling.

07:43.397 --> 07:46.264
The one joke she had
was an--Adore, are you okay?

07:46.266 --> 07:48.099
- Uh-huh.

07:48.101 --> 07:52.604
Even though I'm trying to put on
a smiley face for the day,

07:52.606 --> 07:54.940
everything's
just processing.

07:54.942 --> 08:00.345
And at this point, I'm just
trying to figure shit out.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.080
(sniffles)

08:02.082 --> 08:04.816
- Hello, hello, hello,
kitty girls.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.152
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.020
- Adore Delano.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.322
- Hi, Ru.

08:10.324 --> 08:14.693
- Now, last time, your
Anna Nicole Smith was on point.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.962
It was iconic, actually.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.897
- Thank you.
- Who are you doing?

08:18.899 --> 08:21.867
- Um, Jan Crouch.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.269
- I live for her.
- Yeah.

08:24.271 --> 08:27.739
- Why are your eyes all red?

08:27.741 --> 08:29.140
- Um...

08:29.142 --> 08:32.177
I didn't expect--
I just didn't expect it

08:32.179 --> 08:34.079
to be like this, I think.

08:35.349 --> 08:38.650
I'm thinking of going home.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.087
- Of tapping out?
- I think so.

08:44.958 --> 08:48.159
(RuPaul laughs)

08:48.161 --> 08:50.228
(RuPaul laughs)

08:51.565 --> 08:54.165
- I'm thinking
of going home.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.234
- Of tapping out?

08:56.236 --> 08:57.869
- I think so.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.170
- Why?

09:00.841 --> 09:03.542
- I think that, like,
the critiques last night

09:03.544 --> 09:05.877
and just, like, the vibes.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.979
- You felt
they were extra harsh?

09:07.981 --> 09:10.549
- Yeah, I did.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.517
The Adore thing
is the flannel

09:12.519 --> 09:14.286
and the fucking Riot girl

09:14.288 --> 09:17.589
and grunge-inspired nineties
movement kind of thing,

09:17.591 --> 09:22.394
and it's such
a sensitive subject for me

09:22.396 --> 09:26.131
to work with hundreds of queens
that don't get it.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.599
And then to come back here,

09:27.601 --> 09:30.268
and I feel like Michelle
does not take me seriously.

09:31.471 --> 09:36.241
I believe in beauty
in a denim jacket and barefoot.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.842
- I love all forms of drag.

09:37.844 --> 09:38.944
- Of course.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.211
- But if you're saying

09:40.213 --> 09:43.048
that because of the critiques
on the main stage

09:43.050 --> 09:45.817
are the reason
you're tapping out,

09:45.819 --> 09:48.553
is that enough
to tap out for?

09:51.124 --> 09:54.125
I feel like
you are being sabotaged

09:54.127 --> 09:55.894
by your inner saboteur.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.499
- I look really dramatic
right now,

10:01.501 --> 10:04.836
but it means a lot to me
to just stick to my guns.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.739
I know how hard it took

10:07.741 --> 10:09.007
for me to gain
that confidence

10:09.009 --> 10:12.377
and own my stardom
like you taught me how to.

10:12.379 --> 10:15.246
- What you're doing sounds like
the opposite of confidence.

10:15.248 --> 10:19.284
Confidence means you'll weather
the storm no matter what.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.986
I just know that
you're stronger than this,

10:20.988 --> 10:25.457
and I feel that you're making
this decision based on fear.

10:25.459 --> 10:29.227
The idea of tapping out
and not sticking it through,

10:29.229 --> 10:31.896
what do you think that says
to your young fans?

10:31.898 --> 10:33.698
- I've taken what
you've given me

10:33.700 --> 10:36.768
and I've built a career
off of my aesthetic,

10:36.770 --> 10:39.404
and that speaks to them all.

10:39.406 --> 10:43.608
On social media, there
was some critiques made

10:43.610 --> 10:45.076
about my drag aesthetic,

10:45.078 --> 10:50.348
and I tried to kind of like,
you know, zhuz it up.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.616
At the meet and greet,

10:51.618 --> 10:54.219
one of the fans came up to me
and she was upset.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.854
She was just, like,
you look so uncomfortable

10:55.856 --> 10:57.288
and I know you did this
because of this.

10:57.290 --> 11:00.759
And just know
that what you do,

11:00.761 --> 11:04.462
this is why we dress up
like you.

11:04.464 --> 11:07.332
And there's no one
like you right now.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.368
And to hear them say
how much it means,

11:10.370 --> 11:11.436
that's all
running through my head.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.239
- You know,
you are loved here,

11:14.241 --> 11:16.207
and I want you to stay.

11:16.209 --> 11:19.377
I feel that you will live
to regret this,

11:19.379 --> 11:20.745
and that's
your prerogative.

11:20.747 --> 11:23.081
- I am so forever grateful,

11:23.083 --> 11:26.251
and I love you like
a fucking family member.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.219
You've changed my world.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.689
I have to go.

11:30.691 --> 11:33.091
- Is there anything
I could say to you

11:33.093 --> 11:35.060
that would make you
change your mind?

11:35.062 --> 11:36.961
Is there anything
in the world?

11:36.963 --> 11:38.263
Because I'll say it.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.703
- I feel really confused.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.247
- I'd like for you
to talk to Michelle,

11:56.249 --> 11:59.451
because I know what she said
on the main stage

11:59.453 --> 12:02.087
is a big part of this.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.422
I respect
whatever decision you make.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.790
- I'm so sorry.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.926
- Well, let me give you
some love.

12:11.465 --> 12:13.264
I want you to go
and talk to Michelle

12:13.266 --> 12:14.599
so you can resolve that,
okay?

12:14.601 --> 12:16.067
All right.
I love you, kiddo.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.136
- Thank you very much.
- All right.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.110
- I cannot believe Adore

12:25.112 --> 12:27.679
is actually
seriously considering

12:27.681 --> 12:30.381
leaving the competition
voluntarily.

12:30.383 --> 12:33.351
I'm hoping that Michelle
can say something to Adore

12:33.353 --> 12:34.986
that will make her stay.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.022
- Hello, Alaska.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.357
- Hi-ee.

12:39.359 --> 12:42.861
- Things are just changing
around here by the second.

12:42.863 --> 12:48.867
- I'm so disappointed
in what is happening with Adore,

12:48.869 --> 12:51.636
and I can't even believe
that it's even happening.

12:51.638 --> 12:54.539
This is a huge opportunity,
so it's really upsetting,

12:54.541 --> 12:57.075
and I hope
she changes her mind.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.543
- Yeah. I hope
she changes her mind.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.011
But, you know,
when you're up against

13:00.013 --> 13:02.614
that kind of energy
that's in your head,

13:02.616 --> 13:04.149
it's hard to overcome it.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.284
All right, well,
let's talk Snatch Game.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.753
You did Lady Bunny last time,
and you did it very well.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.622
You were very funny.
- Thank you.

13:10.624 --> 13:14.325
- And this time
I see a big hat.

13:14.327 --> 13:18.229
Is that Mae West?
- Oh, yes-uh.

13:18.231 --> 13:21.366
- (laughs) Have you ever
done Mae West before?

13:21.368 --> 13:22.901
- No.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.203
- You know, a lot of her catch
phrases--she had a ton of them.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.640
- Mm, yeah, a hard man
is good to find, mm, mm.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.275
- (laughs)

13:30.277 --> 13:33.111
Mae West is a funny character,
but the thing is,

13:33.113 --> 13:35.446
there are a lot of
fierce bitches here.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.982
Don't underestimate
what they can do.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.250
- Absolutely.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.919
- Well, I cannot wait to
see you in the Snatch Game.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.921
Make me laugh.
Bye-ee.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.789
- Bye-ee.

13:48.762 --> 13:50.395
- Hi.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.363
As I see Michelle outside,

13:52.365 --> 13:54.265
a bunch of emotions
are coming.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.234
I'm upset, I'm confused.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.535
- Honey, what's going on?

13:57.537 --> 13:59.437
- I'm leaving.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.605
- Tell me why.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.907
- I just didn't feel like
this is for me.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.242
- Because?

14:04.244 --> 14:05.610
- You're a bit harsh, bro.

14:05.612 --> 14:06.711
- Listen.

14:06.713 --> 14:09.147
- But it didn't seem
constructive.

14:09.149 --> 14:12.784
It felt like let's kind of--

14:12.786 --> 14:13.718
- Like take her down
a notch?

14:13.720 --> 14:14.953
- Yeah.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.221
- If you thought it was
personal, absolutely not.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.323
- I thought it was personal.
It sounded personal.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.124
- No. Absolutely not.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.526
- I wanted to throw out
my soul.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.895
- What did you think you were
going to come into?

14:23.897 --> 14:26.464
You know that everything I say
is not for me to be a bitch.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.534
It's for me to push you
and push you and push you.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.870
I want to see you,
in 20 years like RuPaul.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.071
I want to see that.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.739
We've talked about
your drag aesthetic.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.941
We've had many arguments
about it.

14:36.943 --> 14:40.478
I'm pushing you to do something,
yeah, okay, off-brand maybe

14:40.480 --> 14:43.381
or something
you wouldn't do normally.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.652
- Outside
of this competition,

14:47.654 --> 14:50.321
Michelle and I have worked
a lot together.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.956
She definitely tries to do

14:51.958 --> 14:54.359
the mother hen thing
with my aesthetic.

14:54.361 --> 14:57.395
- While we are here to celebrate
all that makes you different,

14:57.397 --> 14:59.063
it's still a competition.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.365
- I also don't want you
to think

15:00.367 --> 15:04.669
that I am being a brat
or unappreciative.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.304
The reason why
I get so emotional

15:06.306 --> 15:08.506
is because
I do care about you.

15:08.508 --> 15:14.045
And going back
to getting judged by you,

15:14.047 --> 15:15.980
the dynamic
is completely different.

15:15.982 --> 15:18.750
- It is!
- And it's fucking with me!

15:18.752 --> 15:20.952
- Again, I can only
apologize

15:20.954 --> 15:23.388
if it came out harsher
than it was intended.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.557
I'm apologizing to you
in front of fucking cameras.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.326
I don't even apologize
to my children.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.460
That makes me sad.

15:29.462 --> 15:30.862
- I know.
It makes me sad.

15:30.864 --> 15:32.597
I'm not even, like, myself.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.432
I'm not Eeyore.
Like, I'm sick of it.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.601
Like, I'm, like, walking around
with puffy-ass fucking eyes.

15:36.603 --> 15:37.835
I'm trying to smile
and shit

15:37.837 --> 15:39.437
looking like
a fuckin swollen baby.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.472
- Tomorrow's--
You're so stupid.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.441
Tomorrow is another day.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.177
I don't want you to wake up
tomorrow morning

15:46.179 --> 15:48.179
and go, what did I do?

15:48.181 --> 15:49.747
And that's a possibility.

15:52.619 --> 15:56.154
- I don't want to put Michelle
or myself in a position

15:56.156 --> 15:58.523
to where either one of us
have to compromise.

15:58.525 --> 16:01.292
This is her job.
She's a judge.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.961
I'd be damned
if I go down that runway

16:02.963 --> 16:04.796
and her look at me
and be like, fuck,

16:04.798 --> 16:07.565
I got to take easy
because she's the chiona.

16:07.567 --> 16:08.566
There's a part of me
that's saying, like,

16:08.568 --> 16:11.469
can I stick it out?

16:17.344 --> 16:18.509
- Coming up...

16:18.511 --> 16:19.944
- Can I be honest?

16:19.946 --> 16:22.280
I think your Joan Crawford
is more like...

16:22.282 --> 16:23.715
It's too you.

16:23.717 --> 16:27.251
- I'm definitely noticing,
working with Phi Phi,

16:27.253 --> 16:29.220
she's very strategic.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.955
- I'm just saying,
you sounded like Alyssa.

16:32.058 --> 16:34.092
(RuPaul laughs)

16:35.362 --> 16:37.729
(RuPaul laughs)

16:37.731 --> 16:40.064
- Hi, Tatianna.
- Hello, Ru.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.833
- The last time
you played Snatch Game,

16:41.835 --> 16:43.334
your Britney was exquisite.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.769
You won the challenge.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.638
How are you gonna repeat
your success?

16:47.640 --> 16:49.440
- I'm doing Ariana Grande.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.808
- Oh, my God,
of course you are.

16:50.810 --> 16:51.809
- Yeah.

16:51.811 --> 16:53.578
- What are her
catch phrases?

16:53.580 --> 16:56.047
- She doesn't have
too many catch phrases,

16:56.049 --> 16:58.383
but she's given
a lot of funny moments.

16:58.385 --> 17:02.353
- I have a feeling that for
the decades since you were on,

17:02.355 --> 17:04.756
that you have been waiting
for this moment

17:04.758 --> 17:07.558
to see all these bitches
with your hands.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.559
Am I right?

17:08.561 --> 17:10.795
- Yeah,
to a certain extent.

17:10.797 --> 17:15.533
I realized never try to win over
the naysayers and the haters.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.635
Put all of your energy
into impressing the people

17:17.637 --> 17:21.139
who were supporters of you
from the beginning.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.508
- That is very wise,
because you know what?

17:23.510 --> 17:25.443
I ain't got time
for the people who hate me.

17:25.445 --> 17:26.944
I'm too busy loving
the people who love me.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.379
- Exactly.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.115
- Are we gonna see you with
them hands on the Snatch Game?

17:31.117 --> 17:32.517
- Oh, yes.
- Make it funny.

17:32.519 --> 17:33.684
- Definitely.
- Okay.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.887
- Thank you.
- (laughs)

17:35.889 --> 17:37.055
Hey, Roxxxy.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.290
-<i> Hola, mi amor.</i>
<i> Como estas?</i>

17:39.292 --> 17:41.659
- You won $10,000 last week.

17:41.661 --> 17:42.727
- Oh, my God.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.996
- You had to also
eliminate a queen.

17:44.998 --> 17:46.697
- A girl that I've known
since I started drag.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.066
- Wow.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.667
- And I might not have that
friendship because of it.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.869
- But, honestly,
she's a seasoned queen.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.671
She knows
how this competition works.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.641
Do you really think that
she will hold it against you?

17:56.643 --> 17:58.676
- I know if she
was thinking like me,

17:58.678 --> 18:00.611
I would think
that's my girl, Roxxxy.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.880
Since she won,
maybe she'll keep me.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.917
Like, you know,
she's on my side.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.352
- Now, last time you played
Snatch Game, you did very well.

18:08.354 --> 18:09.353
- Boom! Yes!

18:09.355 --> 18:11.222
- Yes, you did
Tamara Braxton.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.290
- Tamara Braxton, yes.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.659
- I have no idea.

18:14.661 --> 18:15.860
- A Latina.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.629
I love Ellen.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.665
- I don't know.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.300
- Sofia Vergara.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.768
- Of course.
- Oh, my God.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.804
- I cannot wait to see you
out there in the Snatch Game.

18:26.806 --> 18:27.872
Just make me laugh.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.240
- I will.
- All right.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.374
- I promise.
- Thanks, Roxxxy.

18:30.376 --> 18:31.609
- Thank you.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.111
- All right,
listen up, ladies.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.012
In a few moments,

18:35.014 --> 18:37.515
I'll meet you
on the set of Snatch Game,

18:37.517 --> 18:41.819
where we will be joined
by two legendary queens.

18:41.821 --> 18:46.257
"Drag Race All Stars"
Raven and Juju

18:46.259 --> 18:49.360
will be your celebrities.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.962
- Oh, my God.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.997
- Juju and Raven
are going to be here?

18:52.999 --> 18:54.065
Fuck.

18:54.067 --> 18:55.967
It's gonna be
a son of a bitch.

18:55.969 --> 18:59.303
- So good luck
and don't fuck it up.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.972
- Whoo.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.244
- Adore finally comes back
into the work room.

19:06.246 --> 19:09.113
She looks like she had just
been crying or something.

19:09.115 --> 19:12.750
- Um, I just don't feel
like I'm in it.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.987
It was something different than
I thought it was going to be.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.055
I think I need to go.

19:21.794 --> 19:24.629
I'm leaving "RuPaul's
Drag Race All Stars 2."

19:26.432 --> 19:27.765
I feel like shit.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.333
- I love you,

19:29.335 --> 19:32.436
but I don't want you
to give in to giving up.

19:32.438 --> 19:34.472
- I just don't think
that this is for me.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.141
It's so hard to say goodbye
to everybody.

19:37.143 --> 19:39.243
Good luck.
- Oh.

19:39.245 --> 19:43.781
- I know that not everybody is
going to agree with me, but...

19:55.128 --> 19:57.395
- It's disappointing.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.363
This is a huge opportunity
that we've been given,

19:59.365 --> 20:03.701
and so many people wish
they could've been here.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.436
It does suck because,
you know,

20:05.438 --> 20:07.205
he's a good friend of mine.

20:07.207 --> 20:10.308
But at the same time,
just one bitch down

20:10.310 --> 20:12.677
who also was
a strong competitor.

20:12.679 --> 20:16.847
So I'm just that
much closer to the crown.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.649
- How do you feel?

20:18.651 --> 20:19.884
Can I be honest with you?
- Mm-hmm.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.320
- I'm just gonna be honest.

20:22.322 --> 20:25.623
I think your Joan Crawford
is more like...

20:25.625 --> 20:26.791
It's too you.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.526
- (scoffs)

20:28.528 --> 20:30.695
- I don't want you, like,
offended by what I said.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.029
- Oh, I'm not offended.
- Okay.

20:32.031 --> 20:35.199
I'm just saying, like,
you sounded like a Alyssa.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.337
- So...

20:39.339 --> 20:42.206
- I'm definitely noticing,
working with Phi Phi,

20:42.208 --> 20:46.077
she's very strategic
in this competition.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.845
She's dropping
little comments,

20:47.847 --> 20:51.649
I think in an effort to
make us a little insecure.

21:05.331 --> 21:06.931
- Are you sure?

21:06.933 --> 21:09.567
I'm second guessing
this accent.

21:10.637 --> 21:13.137
I am totally getting
in my head about it.

21:13.139 --> 21:15.806
I'm thinking I am going

21:15.808 --> 21:17.475
to change my character
completely.

21:19.212 --> 21:20.278
- Coming up...

21:20.280 --> 21:22.313
- You know,
I'm black by injection.

21:22.315 --> 21:24.048
(all laugh)

21:24.050 --> 21:25.449
- (laughs)
- Where's the body?

21:25.451 --> 21:28.252
- Barbara, please.
- (laughs)

21:28.254 --> 21:30.321
(RuPaul laughs)

21:31.591 --> 21:33.691
(RuPaul laughs)

21:35.295 --> 21:39.563
- Welcome to the "All Star"
edition of Snatch Game.

21:39.565 --> 21:41.899
Let's meet our contestants.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.367
A stay-at-home mom

21:43.369 --> 21:47.405
from Riverside,
California, Raven.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.775
And a flight attendant

21:50.777 --> 21:53.044
who likes long walks
on the beach,

21:53.046 --> 21:56.147
big dicks
and fried chicken, Jujubee.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.315
- Hi.

21:57.317 --> 22:00.384
- Ladies, are you ready
to meet our stars?

22:00.386 --> 22:02.553
- Yes!
- Yes!

22:02.555 --> 22:06.023
- Praise the Lord,
it's Tammy Faye Baker.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.125
- Forget it.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.260
- Are you wearing makeup?

22:09.262 --> 22:10.594
- Just a little Chapstick.

22:10.596 --> 22:12.997
- My goodness,
you are one of my favorites.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.566
- I know. (sobs)

22:15.568 --> 22:21.272
- Moving on, the original
blonde bombshell,

22:21.274 --> 22:22.807
Mae West is here.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.408
- Well, howdy-doo, Ru?

22:24.410 --> 22:26.077
- How's my little chickadee?

22:26.079 --> 22:27.411
- When I'm good, I'm good,

22:27.413 --> 22:31.415
but when I'm bad, I get
a serious venereal disease.

22:31.417 --> 22:34.318
- (laughs)

22:34.320 --> 22:39.590
Next, the totally whacky
and original Bjork is here.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.058
- I love your suit.
- Thank you.

22:41.060 --> 22:44.962
- It reminds me of the lining
of my small intestine.

22:44.964 --> 22:48.299
- (laughs)

22:48.301 --> 22:53.437
Next, the Long Island
medium, Teresa Caputo.

22:53.439 --> 22:56.474
- Ru, does December 25th
mean anything to you?

22:56.476 --> 22:57.608
- Yes, actually it does.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.643
- Did you receive a gift
on that day?

22:59.645 --> 23:01.812
- I absolutely received
a gift on that day.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.681
- I got a gift.
- Wow.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.049
- Don't mess up my hair,
please.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.117
- Sorry.

23:06.119 --> 23:08.786
- Now, ladies and gentleman,

23:08.788 --> 23:11.122
the legendary Joan Crawford.

23:11.124 --> 23:12.390
How are the kids, Joan?

23:12.392 --> 23:15.393
- Deliberately
trying to embarrass me

23:15.395 --> 23:16.660
in front of these reporters.

23:16.662 --> 23:17.895
- Oh-ho-ho!

23:17.897 --> 23:20.965
- I fought worst monsters
for years in Hollywood.

23:20.967 --> 23:22.032
- Yes, I know.

23:22.034 --> 23:24.001
- Barbara, please.

23:24.003 --> 23:27.438
- (laughs)

23:27.440 --> 23:30.408
- Don't fuck with me,
fellas.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.410
- (laughs)

23:32.412 --> 23:36.480
All right, now TV's
toughest legal eagle,

23:36.482 --> 23:38.349
Nancy Grace is here,
ladies and gentlemen.

23:38.351 --> 23:40.918
- Breaking news, we need
to get down to the basics

23:40.920 --> 23:42.520
of the alleged child abuse.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.889
- Joan Crawford?
- Where's the body?

23:44.891 --> 23:47.525
- Christina,
bring me the ax.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.960
No!

23:49.962 --> 23:54.899
- Moving on down,
Ariana Grande is here.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.066
- Hi, Ru.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.435
- Are you ready
to break free?

23:57.437 --> 23:59.103
- Yeah.

23:59.105 --> 24:04.742
- Next, the one and only
Alaska 5000.

24:04.744 --> 24:07.478
- Hi-ee.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.548
- Roxxxy Andrews total
last minute decision

24:10.550 --> 24:11.916
to switch to Alaska.

24:13.252 --> 24:17.421
- I just have to ask,
is that a wig on your head?

24:17.423 --> 24:20.224
- Uh, if you're not
wearing wigs,

24:20.226 --> 24:22.293
then you're not doing drag.

24:24.664 --> 24:27.465
- Girl, even I know
that Alaska's song

24:27.467 --> 24:30.000
is "this is not a wig,
this is my hair."

24:30.002 --> 24:31.335
- What's the big idea?

24:31.337 --> 24:33.103
- Yeah. (laughs)

24:33.105 --> 24:36.173
All right,
let's play Snatch Game.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.608
Juju, this is for you.

24:37.610 --> 24:38.609
- Okay.

24:38.611 --> 24:41.145
- Those sexy
Kardashian sisters

24:41.147 --> 24:45.483
are starring in a new sci-fi
epic called "Star blank."

24:45.485 --> 24:46.917
Pens down, celebrities.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.486
Okay, Jujubee.

24:48.488 --> 24:51.422
- I'm gonna do it.
"Star Booty."

24:51.424 --> 24:53.390
- "Star Booty."
- Uh-huh, girl.

24:53.392 --> 24:54.525
- Let's go
to the celebrities

24:54.527 --> 24:56.193
and see if you have
any matches on that.

24:56.195 --> 24:59.897
- Zero.
- Joan Crawford.

24:59.899 --> 25:02.566
"Star Booty."
That's a match.

25:02.568 --> 25:03.834
You got it, lady.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.769
- You think you're clever,
don't you?

25:05.771 --> 25:08.005
- (laughs)

25:08.007 --> 25:10.307
- Well, think again.

25:10.309 --> 25:13.777
- Let's go on down to--
Oh, Alaska,

25:13.779 --> 25:15.946
what have you done with
your lipstick, darling?

25:15.948 --> 25:17.681
- Oh, my makeup is terrible.

25:18.718 --> 25:21.519
Now, Ru, I didn't put booty,

25:21.521 --> 25:24.955
but I did put anus,
available on iTunes.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.458
- You know, close,
but not a match.

25:27.460 --> 25:29.894
- Aw.
- Missed it by this much.

25:29.896 --> 25:32.196
- Hi-ee.
- Okay, here we go.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.864
Ariana Grande,
oh, she's got a doughnut.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.833
You're licking the doughnut.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.601
- I love doughnuts.
- You love doughnuts.

25:37.603 --> 25:38.869
- And I love America.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.337
- What's your favorite thing
about America?

25:40.339 --> 25:43.307
- Oh, gosh, the people,
the places, the things.

25:43.309 --> 25:44.475
- Yes.
- Nouns.

25:44.477 --> 25:45.809
- Yeah. (laughs)

25:45.811 --> 25:48.012
So I just, you know,
I drew a doughnut.

25:48.014 --> 25:50.548
- "Star Doughnuts"
is not a match.

25:50.550 --> 25:52.349
All right, let's move
on down to Nancy Grace.

25:52.351 --> 25:56.887
- This just in.
I wrote "Star Injections."

25:56.889 --> 25:58.122
- "Star Injections."

25:58.124 --> 26:01.325
- Illegal injections
of silicone into the body.

26:01.327 --> 26:02.860
- You know,
I'm black by injection.

26:02.862 --> 26:06.664
- Oh! (laughs)

26:06.666 --> 26:08.766
This is going to be
for Raven.

26:08.768 --> 26:12.169
The pit crew have spent way too
much time around drag queens.

26:12.171 --> 26:16.974
Now, before they slip on their
Andrew Christian underwear,

26:16.976 --> 26:20.477
they blank. Raven.

26:20.479 --> 26:24.315
- They take a very tasteful
photo of their nether regions

26:24.317 --> 26:26.517
so that they can post it
online.

26:26.519 --> 26:28.452
They take a selfie.

26:28.454 --> 26:29.753
- They take a selfie.

26:29.755 --> 26:31.755
Let's see if you've got
any matches over here.

26:31.757 --> 26:32.957
- All right,
Tammy Faye Baker.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.391
- As it says in the book,

26:34.393 --> 26:39.096
before thou puteth oneth
a thongeth...

26:39.098 --> 26:40.097
- Yes, uh-huh, yes.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.465
- Thou must pray.

26:41.467 --> 26:43.033
- Pray.
- Pray.

26:43.035 --> 26:45.002
Yeah, I got to pray
before I put on my underwear.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.037
Most of the time
they don't even fit anymore

26:47.039 --> 26:48.539
they're so filled
with God's love.

26:48.541 --> 26:53.010
- Yes, that is not a match,
but a very, very good answer.

26:53.012 --> 26:54.645
It's a very good answer.

26:54.647 --> 26:56.847
- I just--
- You tried your best, darling.

26:56.849 --> 26:58.115
- I tried.

26:59.352 --> 27:00.751
- Moving on down to Bjork.

27:00.753 --> 27:02.620
- Actually, I think
I have the right answer.

27:02.622 --> 27:03.654
- Okay, you have
the right answer?

27:03.656 --> 27:06.123
- I said they remove
their testicles.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.592
- Oh, the judges say, no,
Bjork.

27:08.594 --> 27:10.561
- Oh, I just put mine here.

27:10.563 --> 27:11.929
- You have testicles?

27:11.931 --> 27:16.066
- Sometimes I don't understand
anything about science.

27:16.068 --> 27:19.436
- I'm sorry, Bjork,
but not a match, darling.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.438
- Oh, that's fine.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.340
- (laughs)

27:23.342 --> 27:27.444
Hey, let's move on down
to the Long Island medium.

27:27.446 --> 27:28.646
- Now, we've never met
before,

27:28.648 --> 27:29.913
so I want everybody
to know this.

27:29.915 --> 27:31.015
- Yes.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.249
- I just know exactly what,
you know,

27:32.251 --> 27:36.253
the producers and the background
checkers told me.

27:36.255 --> 27:37.521
- Uh, okay.

27:37.523 --> 27:41.725
- I mean, the spirits
are telling me a selfie.

27:41.727 --> 27:43.460
- A selfie, wow.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.162
- Yes, the spirits are
telling me a--thank you.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.264
- That's uncanny.
That's spooky, isn't it?

27:47.266 --> 27:48.532
- I'm telling you,
I have a gift.

27:48.534 --> 27:49.800
- Yay.

27:49.802 --> 27:52.603
- Let's move on
to Joan Crawford.

27:52.605 --> 27:53.837
What do you say?

27:53.839 --> 27:57.875
- Clean all the wire hangers
out of the closet.

27:57.877 --> 28:00.144
- Wire hangers, Joan?

28:00.146 --> 28:04.982
- No wire hangers ever!

28:04.984 --> 28:06.150
Why?

28:06.152 --> 28:07.151
- Well, that don't make
no kind of sense,

28:07.153 --> 28:09.420
but it sure is
entertaining.

28:09.422 --> 28:10.821
It's just--

28:10.823 --> 28:12.389
- This ain't my first time.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.458
- Yes, yes, at the where?

28:14.460 --> 28:16.326
- At the Snatch Game.

28:16.328 --> 28:19.329
- (laughs)

28:22.134 --> 28:25.602
All right. Jujubee, are
you ready for your question?

28:25.604 --> 28:26.870
- Mm-hmm.

28:26.872 --> 28:30.574
- My play cousin Tornesia
is such a party animal.

28:30.576 --> 28:35.646
When mosquitoes bite her,
they have to go to blank.

28:36.649 --> 28:38.982
Okay, Jujubee.
- The clinic.

28:38.984 --> 28:41.452
- Yes! Good answer.

28:41.454 --> 28:42.453
- Right.

28:42.455 --> 28:44.621
- Let's go to Mae West.

28:44.623 --> 28:47.691
- Well, I'm very happy to say
they have to go to the clinic.

28:47.693 --> 28:49.660
- Oh, we got a match.

28:49.662 --> 28:52.196
- You know, I go to the one on
San Vicente and Santa Monica,

28:52.198 --> 28:53.530
you know what I mean,
Jujubee?

28:53.532 --> 28:55.666
You've been there.
I seen you there a few times.

28:55.668 --> 28:57.067
- Why do you go there,
Mae West?

28:57.069 --> 29:00.738
- 'Cause after your tenth visit,
you get one free, oh.

29:00.740 --> 29:03.207
- (laughs)

29:03.209 --> 29:05.342
Fabulous. All right.

29:05.344 --> 29:06.744
Let's move on down to Bjork.

29:06.746 --> 29:09.413
- I'm pretty excited
'cause I also said clinic.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.081
- You said clinic!
- Yeah.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.816
How many bones do I win?

29:12.818 --> 29:16.019
- How many bones
do you want? Oh.

29:17.123 --> 29:19.823
See you after the show,
bubbles, oh.

29:19.825 --> 29:21.625
Ooh.

29:21.627 --> 29:22.926
- Did you hear that, Bjork?

29:22.928 --> 29:23.994
- I'm down for anything,

29:23.996 --> 29:25.763
especially I'd like
to eat her hair.

29:25.765 --> 29:28.632
It looks like pastrami.

29:28.634 --> 29:30.067
- Something else
looks like pastrami, too.

29:30.069 --> 29:32.770
- (trilling)

29:32.772 --> 29:38.308
- Ow. (gargles) Brrr.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.344
- (laughs)

29:40.346 --> 29:43.747
Let's move on down
to Nancy Grace.

29:43.749 --> 29:46.250
- This just in.
- Oh.

29:46.252 --> 29:49.720
- She had to go to Casey
Anthony's defense attorney.

29:49.722 --> 29:52.523
She partied so hard, RuPaul,

29:52.525 --> 29:54.825
two days after
the child is missing,

29:54.827 --> 29:56.760
she is drinking at the bar.

29:56.762 --> 29:58.662
- Unfortunately,
that is not a match.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.097
- But we do have DNA match,

30:00.099 --> 30:01.932
and that's coming up next
after the commercial break.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.367
Thank you.
- Oh, okay.

30:03.369 --> 30:09.473
Now, Raven, the next question
is a video from Bianca Del Rio.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.708
- Tammy Brown is so unusual,

30:11.710 --> 30:15.779
when she was abducted
by aliens, she blanked them.

30:15.781 --> 30:18.649
- All right, stars.
Write down your answers.

30:18.651 --> 30:21.151
All right, Raven.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.220
- She shaka-buku'd them.

30:23.222 --> 30:27.357
- (laughs)

30:27.359 --> 30:30.694
Let's go on over here
to the Long Island medium.

30:30.696 --> 30:31.762
Are you writing
something down?

30:31.764 --> 30:33.130
- No, no.
- Oh.

30:33.132 --> 30:34.298
Well, yeah, 'cause
you're supposed to match--

30:34.300 --> 30:36.834
- The spirits are telling
shaka-buku them.

30:36.836 --> 30:38.802
- I thought
I saw you writing.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.437
- You didn't seen anything,
Ru, I'm so sorry.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.573
- I didn't anything.
- See, it's the spirits.

30:42.575 --> 30:47.511
- (laughs) All right.
Ariana Grande.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.413
- I put she sang to them?

30:49.415 --> 30:51.448
- Nice try, but no match.
Sorry, Raven.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.250
- Well, that's what
I would've done.

30:53.252 --> 30:54.284
- Let's hear
you sing to them.

30:54.286 --> 30:57.187
- (no sound)

30:57.189 --> 30:58.255
- Oh.

30:58.257 --> 30:59.890
- The last time I went
that high,

30:59.892 --> 31:01.592
one of my dogs died.

31:01.594 --> 31:02.826
- What did you do
to the body?

31:02.828 --> 31:04.628
- Yes, what did you do
with the body?

31:04.630 --> 31:07.231
- (snorts)
I'm sorry. What?

31:07.233 --> 31:08.765
- What did you do
with the body?

31:08.767 --> 31:10.667
- Where's the body
of your dog?

31:10.669 --> 31:13.070
- Tatianna's missing
the mark hardcore.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.404
There's no jokes
coming out of her mouth,

31:14.406 --> 31:17.040
and whatever our jokes
are not landing anywhere.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.809
- Thank you so much.

31:18.811 --> 31:21.311
- Let's move on down
to Alaska.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.247
- She said, hi-ee.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.716
- She said, hi-ee to them.

31:25.718 --> 31:27.951
- Ru is throwing watermelons
down the line,

31:27.953 --> 31:30.821
and, whoo,
swing and a miss.

31:30.823 --> 31:32.823
It's like Little League
softball,

31:32.825 --> 31:36.927
and she has
no arms or legs.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.195
It's sad.

31:38.197 --> 31:41.698
- You still have one more
chance with Mae West.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.467
- Well, Ru, I gotta say,

31:43.469 --> 31:46.136
she probed them
with her tootsie-loo.

31:46.138 --> 31:48.071
- (laughs)

31:48.073 --> 31:49.106
Why dontcha come on up

31:49.108 --> 31:51.141
and fuck me
in the ass sometime?

31:51.143 --> 31:53.744
- (laughs)

31:53.746 --> 31:55.779
You don't beat around
the bush, do you, baby?

31:55.781 --> 31:57.581
- I beat around the bush
all the time.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.917
What are you talking about?

31:59.919 --> 32:01.818
- (laughs)

32:01.820 --> 32:04.221
Okay, kids, our time is up.

32:04.223 --> 32:07.624
The winner
of Snatch Game is...

32:07.626 --> 32:11.695
- Whoo! Hallelu,
I'm back, Ru! Yes!

32:11.697 --> 32:13.964
- She-Angela!
- Hallelu.

32:13.966 --> 32:17.434
- Well, I guess there you
have it, ladies and gentlemen.

32:17.436 --> 32:18.869
Thanks for watching,
everybody.

32:18.871 --> 32:21.471
See you next time
on Snatch Game.

32:21.473 --> 32:24.942
- See you tomorrow, friends.
- Bye.

32:25.844 --> 32:27.210
- Coming up...

32:27.212 --> 32:29.479
- This competition is going
to be even more difficult

32:29.481 --> 32:30.747
because everybody's a judge.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.783
- What do you guys think about,
like, the strategy?

32:32.785 --> 32:34.651
Are you guys still going to
go with the weakest link?

32:34.653 --> 32:37.654
- If I win, I'm eliminating
the strongest competitor.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.559
(RuPaul laughs)

32:43.963 --> 32:46.296
(RuPaul laughs)

32:48.434 --> 32:49.866
- (sighs)

32:49.868 --> 32:52.836
- ¶ It's a runway day,
it's a runway day ¶

32:52.838 --> 32:54.504
Today is elimination day,

32:54.506 --> 32:56.273
so, girl, you better
bring it to the runway.

32:56.275 --> 33:00.577
And it's going to be
a latex extravaganza.

33:00.579 --> 33:01.745
- Will you shut
all the way up?

33:01.747 --> 33:02.913
- What are you doing?

33:02.915 --> 33:05.115
- Girl,
she is Joan Crawford.

33:05.117 --> 33:07.317
Do you sleep
in a bucket of ice?

33:07.319 --> 33:08.585
- You better get it,
Hannibal Lector.

33:08.587 --> 33:09.753
You look great.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.655
Are you wearing that
down the runway, mama?

33:13.459 --> 33:15.492
- (laughs)

33:15.494 --> 33:17.194
- I can't with you.

33:17.196 --> 33:18.729
- You didn't ever do
a beauty mask, girl?

33:18.731 --> 33:19.997
- Obviously not.

33:19.999 --> 33:22.232
(all laugh)

33:22.234 --> 33:24.801
- What do you guys think
about, like, the strategy

33:24.803 --> 33:26.303
and, like, how you're
gonna vote people off?

33:26.305 --> 33:28.772
Are you guys still going to
go with the weakest link and--

33:28.774 --> 33:31.008
- If I win, I'm eliminating
the strongest competitor.

33:31.010 --> 33:32.609
- Are you?
- Are you being serious?

33:32.611 --> 33:33.844
- No.
- Oh.

33:33.846 --> 33:35.312
(all laugh)

33:35.314 --> 33:37.981
- Now, is it whoever's
weakest in the challenge

33:37.983 --> 33:39.916
or challenge plus runway

33:39.918 --> 33:41.218
or challenge
divided by runway time two?

33:41.220 --> 33:43.954
- That's a great question.

33:43.956 --> 33:45.856
- Whoever accumulates
the most points.

33:45.858 --> 33:47.724
- All right.
- Is safe.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.760
It's an accumulative
contest.

33:49.762 --> 33:50.794
- But that's a really good
question.

33:50.796 --> 33:53.063
What factor
does the runway play?

33:53.065 --> 33:55.232
- If it's a tie, you gotta
work it with the runway.

33:55.234 --> 33:57.367
- Yeah.
- Okay, that's fair.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.536
- This competition is going
to be even more difficult

33:59.538 --> 34:02.005
because everybody's
a judge now.

34:02.007 --> 34:04.441
I would like to think
that I would be Khaleesi,

34:04.443 --> 34:07.611
but I could go over to
the Lannister side, too.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.579
Ugh.

34:09.581 --> 34:10.881
- The only point
in me coming on the show

34:10.883 --> 34:12.249
is to show
that I'm a monster.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.917
- (laughs)

34:13.919 --> 34:14.985
- I'll tell you one thing.

34:14.987 --> 34:16.186
If I win the challenge,

34:16.188 --> 34:18.021
I'm taking all three
of those lipsticks.

34:18.023 --> 34:19.022
Triple elimination.

34:19.024 --> 34:20.557
(snap, snap, snap)

34:20.559 --> 34:24.728
- how did it feel being in front
of Raven and Juju yesterday?

34:24.730 --> 34:26.496
- Right. That's crazy.

34:26.498 --> 34:30.033
- Half of it was, like,
yay, hello, old friends.

34:30.035 --> 34:31.935
And then, the other half
was like,

34:31.937 --> 34:33.703
oh, this is kind of
nerve-wracking.

34:33.705 --> 34:35.405
It's a little bit of déjà vu

34:35.407 --> 34:38.642
because Juju and Raven
are also Season 2 girls.

34:38.644 --> 34:39.943
- Were you friends with them
on Season 2?

34:39.945 --> 34:41.912
- Oh, yeah. I was really close
with Jujubee,

34:41.914 --> 34:45.382
and me and Raven
had a splendid relationship.

34:45.384 --> 34:46.817
(all laugh)

34:46.819 --> 34:48.452
- You know what I think
is cool for you

34:48.454 --> 34:50.620
is that, like, there's
potentially the opportunity

34:50.622 --> 34:53.623
for you to gain
a whole new fan base

34:53.625 --> 34:56.526
because the fans
are so fucking young now.

34:56.528 --> 34:57.761
- Yeah.
- And a lot of them,

34:57.763 --> 34:58.995
they've just started
watching the show

34:58.997 --> 35:00.464
at, like, Season 5, 6, 7.

35:00.466 --> 35:01.465
You know what I mean?
So, like--

35:01.467 --> 35:03.733
- 4, 5, 6.

35:03.735 --> 35:04.701
- It's like a rebirth.
You know what I mean?

35:04.703 --> 35:06.103
- Yeah.

35:06.105 --> 35:08.638
And that's why I'm kind of
taking this competition

35:08.640 --> 35:12.042
so seriously is 'cause I really
want to reintroduce myself

35:12.044 --> 35:13.810
to the world.

35:13.812 --> 35:17.080
The stakes for me in this
elimination are high.

35:17.082 --> 35:19.082
I need to be here.
I need to be given a chance

35:19.084 --> 35:23.253
to show everyone I'm total
"All Star" material.

35:26.091 --> 35:29.025
- This was not intentional.

35:29.027 --> 35:30.727
- Didn't you hear me
talking about it?

35:30.729 --> 35:33.563
- No, I didn't hear you
talking about it.

35:33.565 --> 35:35.065
I'll show you my notebook.

35:35.067 --> 35:36.867
I drew pictures of it
last night, honey.

35:36.869 --> 35:38.535
- Oh.

35:38.537 --> 35:41.438
- Do you guys think it's worth
winning the lip sync

35:41.440 --> 35:43.206
and the 10 grand
to send someone home, Katya?

35:43.208 --> 35:44.508
- Yes, definitely.
- I have to do it.

35:44.510 --> 35:45.876
- Thank you. Me, too.
- Definitely.

35:45.878 --> 35:47.010
- Me, too.
- I have to do it and--

35:47.012 --> 35:48.145
- It's a competition.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.112
- Thank you. Me, too.
- That's it.

35:49.114 --> 35:50.580
- Give me a high five.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.716
- But you know what, you guys
are, like, high fiving stuff,

35:52.718 --> 35:54.117
but everybody
feels different about it.

35:54.119 --> 35:55.785
Like, for me--
- No, it's not.

35:55.787 --> 35:56.920
- But we're here to--
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.121
Can I finish?
I'm so sorry.

35:58.123 --> 36:00.223
We're gonna get this money
afterwards.

36:00.225 --> 36:02.259
Let's be real.
For me, I just couldn't--

36:02.261 --> 36:05.862
It's hard 'cause I wouldn't
want to be, like,

36:05.864 --> 36:07.164
well, sorry, girl.
You know what I mean?

36:07.166 --> 36:08.732
- Well, it's not about
the cash tip, though.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.433
It's about the end
of the finish line.

36:10.435 --> 36:11.768
- Thank you.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.036
- And I guess that's why
we're all different.

36:13.038 --> 36:14.204
- We all have different feelings
about different things,

36:14.206 --> 36:15.872
and I guess
that's how that is.

36:15.874 --> 36:17.140
I don't know.

36:17.142 --> 36:18.375
I feel like my words are getting
twisted, but never mind.

36:18.377 --> 36:19.643
- Just take a deep breath

36:19.645 --> 36:22.946
and go, it's gonna be
a lovely runway, gal.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.214
- (laughs)

36:25.617 --> 36:27.217
- Oh!

36:27.219 --> 36:29.553
(RuPaul laughs)

36:29.555 --> 36:33.456
- ¶ Cover girl, put the bass
in your walk ¶

36:37.129 --> 36:40.730
¶ Cover girl, put the bass
in your walk ¶

36:40.732 --> 36:44.401
¶ Head to toe,
let your whole body talk ¶

36:44.403 --> 36:46.002
¶ Cover girl ¶

36:46.004 --> 36:48.271
- Whoo!
- Girl, what?

36:48.273 --> 36:50.106
(applause)

36:50.108 --> 36:51.374
- Welcome to the main stage

36:51.376 --> 36:54.311
of "RuPaul's
Drag Race All Stars."

36:54.313 --> 36:57.814
Michelle Visage,
what's new, pussycat?

36:57.816 --> 37:01.685
- You, my darling,
are the supreme All Star.

37:01.687 --> 37:03.920
- Style superstar
Carson Kressley,

37:03.922 --> 37:06.289
are you feeling judgy,
darling?

37:06.291 --> 37:08.758
- I'm feeling joodgy.
Is that okay?

37:08.760 --> 37:09.759
- I love it.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.795
The incredible
Todrick Hall.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.296
Are you ready for more?

37:13.298 --> 37:16.166
- Ru, I was born ready
and the rest...

37:16.168 --> 37:18.969
- Is draw.

37:18.971 --> 37:20.837
And he's back.

37:20.839 --> 37:23.473
Ross Matthews,
how you doing?

37:23.475 --> 37:24.474
- Oh, honey,
you know I'm back.

37:24.476 --> 37:26.443
I am a sucker
for the Snatch.

37:26.445 --> 37:28.211
- (laughs)

37:28.213 --> 37:30.413
This week,
we challenged our queens

37:30.415 --> 37:33.016
to give us
imitations of life,

37:33.018 --> 37:36.620
and tonight,
in latex eleganza,

37:36.622 --> 37:40.290
they're ready to burn rubber
on the runway.

37:40.292 --> 37:42.892
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

37:42.894 --> 37:45.395
and may the best woman win.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.369
First up, Phi Phi O'Hara.

37:52.371 --> 37:55.939
Oh. She's got all her ducks
in a row.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.408
- I'd hate to see the bill
for that.

37:58.410 --> 37:59.976
- (laughs)

37:59.978 --> 38:01.478
- This costume
is totally me:

38:01.480 --> 38:03.747
fun and, like,
almost pinup-y.

38:03.749 --> 38:05.548
And I wanted the jewelry
to speak for itself.

38:05.550 --> 38:09.019
I feel super skinny and then
the booty is, like, on point.

38:09.021 --> 38:10.920
I feel so adorable.

38:10.922 --> 38:12.589
- I wonder if you put her
in a bathtub, she'll float.

38:12.591 --> 38:14.858
- Well, if it quacks
like a duck...

38:14.860 --> 38:17.027
- Yeah.
- Quack quack.

38:17.029 --> 38:18.995
- Roxxxy Andrews.

38:18.997 --> 38:20.697
Look at that body!

38:20.699 --> 38:23.033
- Look at that
hourglass shape.

38:23.035 --> 38:25.135
- It's inner tubular.

38:25.137 --> 38:28.571
- I am fixing to sell
this garment, darling.

38:28.573 --> 38:30.874
I've got
my big nineties hair on.

38:30.876 --> 38:33.810
I'm feeling
total gothic glam.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.412
I'm feeling
very Violet Chachki,

38:35.414 --> 38:37.681
but the plus-sized thick
and juicy Violet Chachki.

38:37.683 --> 38:40.150
- Well, if a tire
goes out on my car,

38:40.152 --> 38:41.985
I'll know who to call.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.354
- She's ribbed
for your pleasure.

38:44.356 --> 38:46.089
- Yes, she is.

38:46.091 --> 38:48.024
- Alyssa Edwards.

38:48.026 --> 38:49.426
Ooh.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.227
- Her lips don't lie.
- No.

38:51.229 --> 38:53.763
- That dress is a roadmap
for her man.

38:53.765 --> 38:55.699
- Oh, I can read her lips
from here.

38:55.701 --> 38:57.300
- Yeah. (laughs)

38:57.302 --> 38:59.035
Pow, right in the kisser.

38:59.037 --> 39:00.236
- I am living.

39:00.238 --> 39:03.273
I'm colorful, I'm vibrant,
ferocious.

39:03.275 --> 39:05.041
I got my dress on
with the lips

39:05.043 --> 39:06.743
'cause you know
I got plenty of secrets.

39:06.745 --> 39:07.844
I got to hold back some

39:07.846 --> 39:10.080
I keep in the vault
just in case.

39:10.082 --> 39:11.815
- I want to kiss her
all over.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.383
- Or just kiss her ass.

39:13.385 --> 39:15.852
(all laugh)

39:15.854 --> 39:18.154
- Up next, Katya.

39:18.156 --> 39:19.689
She's into water sports.

39:19.691 --> 39:23.059
- Oh, it's Esther Williams'
cousin, Fister Williams.

39:23.061 --> 39:24.828
(RuPaul laughs)

39:24.830 --> 39:27.030
- Wow. Look at those
breast strokes.

39:27.032 --> 39:29.366
- Our cycles
are synchronized.

39:29.368 --> 39:32.168
- I'm giving you a skin tight
sea foam green

39:32.170 --> 39:34.237
Esther Williams
underwater fantasy.

39:34.239 --> 39:36.840
My waist is cinched,
my nose is pinched,

39:36.842 --> 39:40.844
and my body
is absolutely drenched in sweat.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.512
- Her look is making me wet.

39:42.514 --> 39:46.282
- Take a dip
in the cool waters of Katya.

39:46.284 --> 39:47.917
(all laugh)

39:47.919 --> 39:49.085
Tatianna.

39:49.087 --> 39:51.621
- She's a tramp, a scamp
and a bit of a...

39:51.623 --> 39:53.189
- Vamp.
- Uh-huh.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.091
- That girl is poison.

39:55.093 --> 39:58.428
- My latex look
is real dark lady,

39:58.430 --> 40:00.029
and I'm feeling
a little sexy.

40:00.031 --> 40:01.898
Also, it totally
shows off the fact

40:01.900 --> 40:04.968
that I haven't eaten in a week,
so I'm feeling cute.

40:04.970 --> 40:06.336
- She's like
Johnny Gill said,

40:06.338 --> 40:08.271
you better rub her
the right way.

40:08.273 --> 40:09.506
(all laugh)

40:09.508 --> 40:11.674
- That's her chastity dress.

40:11.676 --> 40:14.477
- Alaska, fashion.
- Yes.

40:14.479 --> 40:16.446
- Just gotta do something
about that uni-brow.

40:16.448 --> 40:17.680
- She's gotta
get that plucked.

40:17.682 --> 40:20.183
- This is totally
Blade Rubber.

40:20.185 --> 40:22.485
(all laugh)
- Yes.

40:22.487 --> 40:26.589
- I'm wearing head to toe
rubber latex

40:26.591 --> 40:29.492
geometrical severe fantasy.

40:29.494 --> 40:31.694
I'm nine parts super model

40:31.696 --> 40:35.765
and one part robot
and ready for insertion.

40:35.767 --> 40:39.636
- Why are her gloves so--
oh, oh, I get it.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.504
(all laugh)

40:41.506 --> 40:42.505
- Bye-ee.

40:42.507 --> 40:44.707
Designed for your pleather.

40:44.709 --> 40:46.042
Ginger Minj.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.310
- She's gone platinum.

40:47.312 --> 40:50.313
- I like the mermaid cut
or is it uncut?

40:50.315 --> 40:51.748
(all laugh)

40:51.750 --> 40:55.452
- I'm just walking
so eleg-wently down the runway.

40:55.454 --> 40:59.556
This gown hugs every
single curve in my body.

40:59.558 --> 41:04.494
I have never felt more beautiful
in my entire life.

41:04.496 --> 41:05.829
- Yeah, girl.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.797
- Yes, you better rub
that lamp, honey.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.632
- Something's
gonna come out.

41:09.634 --> 41:11.267
(all laugh)

41:11.269 --> 41:12.302
- Detox.

41:12.304 --> 41:14.571
(gasp) Yes, mama!

41:14.573 --> 41:16.372
- Raccoon eleganza.

41:16.374 --> 41:19.008
- Now, that is a thigh gap,
Beyonce.

41:19.010 --> 41:20.844
(all laugh)

41:20.846 --> 41:22.812
- My whole vibe
for this look

41:22.814 --> 41:27.150
is, like, this Amazonian
warrior goddess,

41:27.152 --> 41:28.351
and I feel really fierce.

41:28.353 --> 41:30.553
My tuck is right.
I'm brilliant.

41:30.555 --> 41:33.156
I'm beautiful.
Because why?

41:33.158 --> 41:34.591
I'm Detox.

41:34.593 --> 41:37.460
- Now, that's what I call
an apple bottom.

41:37.462 --> 41:38.461
- Red delicious.

41:38.463 --> 41:40.697
- ¶ Sexy, sexy drag queen ¶

41:40.699 --> 41:41.731
- Coming up...

41:41.733 --> 41:44.534
- Unbelievable,
like breathtaking.

41:44.536 --> 41:46.769
- I loved this runway look.

41:46.771 --> 41:49.772
- Um, it was a little
Nancy Gross.

41:49.774 --> 41:51.841
(RuPaul laughs)

41:53.144 --> 41:55.745
(RuPaul laughs)

41:55.747 --> 41:57.547
- Welcome, ladies.

41:57.549 --> 42:01.417
I want to remind you
why we are all here.

42:01.419 --> 42:03.586
I invited you to "All Stars"

42:03.588 --> 42:06.923
because I believe you are
the best of the best.

42:06.925 --> 42:11.294
With this invitation
comes great responsibility,

42:11.296 --> 42:13.563
and I've fought
my entire life

42:13.565 --> 42:15.865
to not only grow my career,

42:15.867 --> 42:19.235
but to build something that
could help launch others.

42:19.237 --> 42:21.204
Every week that you're here

42:21.206 --> 42:25.475
is another opportunity
to build your brand and legacy.

42:25.477 --> 42:29.345
But there are no
free passes, ladies.

42:29.347 --> 42:31.948
This is still a competition.

42:31.950 --> 42:34.884
And now,
I need to hear from you.

42:34.886 --> 42:37.554
Ladies, are you in it
to win it?

42:37.556 --> 42:38.955
- Yes!
- Yes!

42:38.957 --> 42:41.424
- Good. That's what
I wanted to hear.

42:41.426 --> 42:45.795
Now, when I call your name,
please step forward.

42:45.797 --> 42:50.967
Alyssa Edwards, Ginger Minj.

42:50.969 --> 42:53.503
You are safe.

42:54.539 --> 42:57.607
Please step
to the back of the stage.

43:02.180 --> 43:04.347
The rest of you represent

43:04.349 --> 43:07.383
the tops and the bottoms
of the week.

43:07.385 --> 43:09.352
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

43:09.354 --> 43:12.188
First up, Phi Phi O'Hara.

43:12.190 --> 43:14.223
- Tonight,
on an "All Star" stage,

43:14.225 --> 43:18.461
coming out in a latex swimsuit
didn't make me very happy.

43:18.463 --> 43:19.696
- Okay.

43:19.698 --> 43:21.564
- Your makeup is a little off
tonight, too.

43:21.566 --> 43:23.266
Your contouring's
so severe for you.

43:23.268 --> 43:24.400
- I was there for your Gaga,

43:24.402 --> 43:27.670
so I was looking at your
Snatch real close, okay?

43:27.672 --> 43:29.105
My face
was right up in there.

43:29.107 --> 43:31.107
Teresa Caputo
is the perfect kind of person

43:31.109 --> 43:35.311
to pick for the Snatch Game,
and you did a great job with it.

43:35.313 --> 43:37.113
So consistent
all the way through.

43:37.115 --> 43:38.147
- Yay.

43:38.149 --> 43:39.949
- All right.
Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.

43:39.951 --> 43:41.784
- Hey.
- This whole runway look,

43:41.786 --> 43:44.520
like, when I first saw you
come out, I was like, eh.

43:44.522 --> 43:46.022
I don't know.

43:46.024 --> 43:47.290
Like, it's maybe a little too,
like, dead on and literal

43:47.292 --> 43:48.424
when you think of latex.

43:48.426 --> 43:50.727
But the way
you put it all together

43:50.729 --> 43:54.063
made for a better outfit
than just what this dress is.

43:54.065 --> 43:55.865
- It was a bumpy
Snatch Game for you.

43:55.867 --> 43:59.769
It's like, ooh, it just didn't
feel like a yay kind of thing.

43:59.771 --> 44:00.770
- Yeah.
- The thing about Alaska,

44:00.772 --> 44:03.172
she's funny, quick, snappy.

44:03.174 --> 44:04.841
There's a lot
of little surprises

44:04.843 --> 44:06.042
that you get with Alaska

44:06.044 --> 44:08.578
that I didn't get
from that performance.

44:08.580 --> 44:12.348
- In the work room, you said
you were gonna do Sofia Vergara,

44:12.350 --> 44:13.449
but you changed your mind.

44:13.451 --> 44:16.719
- I changed because
something told me

44:16.721 --> 44:18.955
I would've bombed Sofia,

44:18.957 --> 44:21.491
like, worse than
I would've done Alaska.

44:21.493 --> 44:23.226
- When you come into
this competition,

44:23.228 --> 44:25.128
you already know that you're
going to be doing Snatch Game,

44:25.130 --> 44:26.496
so maybe
it would've been wise

44:26.498 --> 44:29.065
to really think about that
before yesterday.

44:29.067 --> 44:31.334
- Up next, Katya.

44:31.336 --> 44:33.636
- I love this runway look
so much.

44:33.638 --> 44:35.405
I like
when people do something

44:35.407 --> 44:36.973
that's what
you're not expecting.

44:36.975 --> 44:38.207
And what you gave us
was, like,

44:38.209 --> 44:40.943
this Esther Williams moment
with the full cap.

44:40.945 --> 44:42.378
And you have, like,
the nose thing,

44:42.380 --> 44:45.415
which is a genius little touch
that I expect from Katya.

44:45.417 --> 44:46.549
So right on.

44:46.551 --> 44:49.719
Snatch Game.
I loved the Snatch Game.

44:49.721 --> 44:50.953
When I think of Bjork,

44:50.955 --> 44:54.357
I think of, like,
an Icelandic toddler on LSD,

44:54.359 --> 44:55.892
and you gave me that.
- You're just brilliant.

44:55.894 --> 44:59.696
You're an artist and all of your
answers were just so psychotic,

44:59.698 --> 45:01.197
and I just love everything
that you do.

45:01.199 --> 45:03.533
- Whether people knew
who Bjork was or not,

45:03.535 --> 45:06.269
we all understood
exactly what you were doing,

45:06.271 --> 45:08.905
and that's what makes
a really good characterization.

45:08.907 --> 45:10.540
It was fabulous.

45:10.542 --> 45:12.008
- Thank you so much.

45:12.010 --> 45:15.378
(all laugh)
- Up next, Tatianna.

45:15.380 --> 45:17.480
- Tonight on the runway,
it's kind of basic.

45:17.482 --> 45:19.849
It's something you'd see in a
Fredrick's catalog or something.

45:19.851 --> 45:21.150
- Okay.

45:21.152 --> 45:23.019
- To me, it doesn't scream
Tatianna in any way.

45:23.021 --> 45:25.722
Your look for Ariana Grande,
spot on.

45:25.724 --> 45:28.458
So the characterization
was there for me.

45:28.460 --> 45:31.227
I think where you lost it
were the comebacks.

45:31.229 --> 45:34.931
- There were moments where
Ru would totally set you up

45:34.933 --> 45:37.333
and you just had to, like,
spike it back over the net,

45:37.335 --> 45:38.768
and that didn't happen
for me.

45:38.770 --> 45:40.903
I can't believe I just used
a sports reference.

45:40.905 --> 45:43.639
That's never happened.

45:45.477 --> 45:47.543
- I'm sorry.
(sniffles)

45:48.880 --> 45:52.181
This means so much
and I fucked it up.

45:57.655 --> 45:58.821
- Don't be sorry.

45:58.823 --> 46:02.458
Be fierce because
you are an "All Star."

46:04.896 --> 46:07.764
Thank you, Tatianna.
- Thank you.

46:07.766 --> 46:10.266
- Up next, Alaska.

46:10.268 --> 46:12.168
- I loved this runway look,

46:12.170 --> 46:14.804
and I think
what's so great about you

46:14.806 --> 46:16.072
is that you're versatile.

46:16.074 --> 46:19.475
I know. Big surprise.
But yes, the details.

46:19.477 --> 46:21.878
The dress, the makeup,
the dye line of the hair,

46:21.880 --> 46:23.513
it's chic and glamorous.

46:23.515 --> 46:24.680
The only callout
on the look,

46:24.682 --> 46:27.083
I would've loved,
like, a cooler shoe.

46:27.085 --> 46:30.086
- Me, too.
- Right? I know, I know.

46:30.088 --> 46:31.687
- The Snatch Game.

46:31.689 --> 46:35.792
It was brilliant from
the beginning to the end.

46:35.794 --> 46:39.128
It was just an amalgamation
of sheer genius.

46:39.130 --> 46:40.129
- You did something
really smart.

46:40.131 --> 46:41.664
You not only entertained us,

46:41.666 --> 46:44.167
but you educated
our audience out there,

46:44.169 --> 46:46.402
who may not know
who Mae West is.

46:46.404 --> 46:49.772
- Mae West now, for me,
is you doing Mae West.

46:49.774 --> 46:51.474
Every time I go through
a drive thru now,

46:51.476 --> 46:53.843
I'm gonna go,
oh, I want a number one-uh.

46:53.845 --> 46:55.678
- Drive up
and see me some time.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.713
- Super size me some time.

46:57.715 --> 47:00.783
- Up next, Detox.

47:00.785 --> 47:02.885
- Let's talk about
this look right now,

47:02.887 --> 47:04.353
which I'm living for.

47:04.355 --> 47:07.023
It's like the epitome of,
like, latex glamour.

47:07.025 --> 47:08.958
- Unbelievable.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.893
Like, breathtaking
when you walked out.

47:10.895 --> 47:12.428
It was just like
an oil painting.

47:12.430 --> 47:14.630
Like a perverted
oil painting.

47:14.632 --> 47:16.799
- You just look phenomenal.

47:16.801 --> 47:18.067
You killed it.
- Thank you very much.

47:18.069 --> 47:19.969
- And I just want to know,
where did you put it?

47:19.971 --> 47:21.604
- Oh, you know where it is.

47:21.606 --> 47:25.274
(all laugh)

47:25.276 --> 47:27.109
- The Nancy Grace.

47:27.111 --> 47:28.344
At first, I was like,
oh, my God,

47:28.346 --> 47:30.179
Nancy Grace
was from Staten Island?

47:30.181 --> 47:31.981
You're, like, listen to me.

47:31.983 --> 47:34.183
- In the beginning, it was
a little Nancy Gross, you know.

47:34.185 --> 47:37.019
It wasn't really there yet,
but you found your way.

47:37.021 --> 47:40.022
- It wasn't the right voice, but
it was kind of the right person,

47:40.024 --> 47:42.124
so I'm gonna give you
a C on that.

47:43.394 --> 47:45.728
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

47:45.730 --> 47:47.964
I've made some decisions.

47:49.767 --> 47:54.537
Katya, Alaska,

47:54.539 --> 47:58.641
you are the top two
"All Stars" of the week.

47:58.643 --> 48:00.376
(applause)
Congratulations.

48:00.378 --> 48:03.546
You've each won
two VIP tickets

48:03.548 --> 48:07.884
to Cirque du Soliel's
sexy adult cabaret "Zumanity,"

48:07.886 --> 48:12.555
including airfare and deluxe
Las Vegas accommodations.

48:12.557 --> 48:15.825
- Wow, cool.

48:17.128 --> 48:21.497
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
you lucky duck, you're safe.

48:23.001 --> 48:29.071
That means Roxxxy Andrews,
Tatianna, Detox,

48:29.073 --> 48:31.240
you are in the bottom three.

48:33.011 --> 48:37.280
Katya and Alaska,
each of you needs to decide

48:37.282 --> 48:41.417
which of the bottom three
you'll eliminate

48:41.419 --> 48:44.587
if you win the lip sync.

48:44.589 --> 48:48.557
So while you queens
deliberate in the work room,

48:48.559 --> 48:52.995
the judges and I
will enjoy root beer floats.

48:52.997 --> 48:56.065
You may leave the stage.

48:57.001 --> 48:58.501
Coming up...

48:58.503 --> 49:02.972
- I know that we're looking
at this Rolaskatox situation,

49:02.974 --> 49:05.174
but that was
a long time ago.

49:05.176 --> 49:06.709
- She can say that
all she wants to,

49:06.711 --> 49:08.644
but in the end,

49:08.646 --> 49:10.780
she's not going to send home
her best friend here.

49:10.782 --> 49:12.982
- Now win this lip sync.
- Okay.

49:13.918 --> 49:16.085
(RuPaul laughs)

49:17.422 --> 49:19.855
(RuPaul laughs)

49:23.061 --> 49:25.761
- It's an odd feeling
being in the top,

49:25.763 --> 49:29.065
and then coming into
the work room for deliberation.

49:29.067 --> 49:30.266
- Thrilled.

49:30.268 --> 49:31.934
- Because
I'm one of the people

49:31.936 --> 49:33.869
who has to make a decision

49:33.871 --> 49:35.571
about some other people
in the room.

49:35.573 --> 49:39.976
- Tatianna, Roxxxy and Detox
are in the bottom.

49:39.978 --> 49:42.478
I don't necessarily agree that
Detox should be in the bottom.

49:42.480 --> 49:46.682
Her runway destroyed.

49:46.684 --> 49:48.751
"National Geographic"
meets "Italian Vogue"

49:48.753 --> 49:50.786
meets
"Better Homes and Gardens."

49:50.788 --> 49:52.021
Flawless.

49:52.023 --> 49:54.090
- One of y'all
is about to get $10,000.

49:54.092 --> 49:55.157
- Yeah.

49:55.159 --> 49:56.225
- When you win a challenge,

49:56.227 --> 49:59.028
it's just so,
like, exciting.

49:59.030 --> 50:02.598
And now it's sort of,
like, much heavier

50:02.600 --> 50:06.068
because there's this huge
responsibility attached to it.

50:06.070 --> 50:08.738
I would like to have a moment
with each of you

50:08.740 --> 50:10.673
on the other sofa.

50:10.675 --> 50:13.376
So whoever
wants to come first.

50:13.378 --> 50:14.543
- Well, I'm here, I guess.

50:16.681 --> 50:18.781
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

50:18.783 --> 50:22.018
I wasn't expecting
to see you in the bottom.

50:22.020 --> 50:23.686
- Neither was I,
but at the same time,

50:23.688 --> 50:27.323
I feel good enough
that I wasn't the worst

50:27.325 --> 50:29.458
and I looked the best today.
(laughs)

50:29.460 --> 50:31.060
- Hallelu.

50:31.062 --> 50:32.228
- Do you know what I mean?

50:32.230 --> 50:34.030
- And it's crazy
because it's like

50:34.032 --> 50:36.532
this, like,
Rolaskatox-esque moment.

50:36.534 --> 50:38.768
- I know. I was
just about to say. Mm-hmm.

50:38.770 --> 50:40.770
- But whatever decision
is made,

50:40.772 --> 50:43.105
that is not
going to be favoritism.

50:43.107 --> 50:45.307
- Right, and I respect
whatever decision it is

50:45.309 --> 50:46.609
that you come up with.

50:46.611 --> 50:49.712
- Well, it's such a shame
I fucking hate you.

50:49.714 --> 50:50.846
- Should I start
packing now or--

50:50.848 --> 50:52.681
- (laughs)
You probably should.

50:52.683 --> 50:54.383
- Shall I send over
the next clown?

50:54.385 --> 50:55.518
- Yeah, sure.

50:57.622 --> 50:59.388
- Are you sure
you're gonna wear that?

50:59.390 --> 51:00.556
- I'm gonna see
if I can get changed,

51:00.558 --> 51:01.824
because this little
hobble dress

51:01.826 --> 51:03.926
is not gonna be
very enter-tainting.

51:03.928 --> 51:04.994
- Do you need help?

51:04.996 --> 51:06.462
- Yes. Would you, please?

51:07.632 --> 51:09.532
- How are you doing?

51:09.534 --> 51:12.168
- Um, I expected it.

51:12.170 --> 51:13.569
- You did?

51:13.571 --> 51:15.104
- I definitely know I was
one of the weaker links, so...

51:15.106 --> 51:18.007
- Whatever decision is made,
it's not coming

51:18.009 --> 51:21.310
because of favoritism
or anything like that.

51:21.312 --> 51:22.578
- Just do
what you feel is right.

51:22.580 --> 51:24.713
But congratulations.

51:24.715 --> 51:26.115
- Thank you.

51:26.117 --> 51:27.483
- Now win this lip sync.

51:27.485 --> 51:29.418
Win it.

51:29.420 --> 51:31.320
- Okay.
- Win it.

51:31.322 --> 51:33.255
I'm hoping we're gonna
stay true to what we said,

51:33.257 --> 51:34.557
because I feel like

51:34.559 --> 51:36.992
the girl who got the harshest
critiques was Tatianna.

51:36.994 --> 51:39.695
So if we're sticking
through to our plan,

51:39.697 --> 51:41.297
I should be good to go.

51:44.102 --> 51:45.301
- Hi, how are you?

51:45.303 --> 51:48.471
- Um, not good.

51:48.473 --> 51:50.973
- I'm sorry
that you're in the bottom.

51:50.975 --> 51:56.011
I know that we're looking at
this Rolaskatox-esque situation,

51:56.013 --> 51:58.214
but that was
a long time ago,

51:58.216 --> 52:00.416
and I want you to know
that whatever happens,

52:00.418 --> 52:05.254
it's not based on friends
and family discounts

52:05.256 --> 52:08.691
or, you know, favoritism
or anything like that.

52:08.693 --> 52:10.392
- Yeah.

52:10.394 --> 52:12.027
She can say that
all she wants to,

52:12.029 --> 52:14.196
but in the end,

52:14.198 --> 52:17.166
she's not going to send home
her best friend here.

52:17.168 --> 52:18.767
- So I just want you
to know that.

52:18.769 --> 52:20.503
- I trust it'll be
a fair decision.

52:20.505 --> 52:24.874
- I think you're stunning
and really cool.

52:24.876 --> 52:26.442
- Sorry.

52:26.444 --> 52:28.511
Stupid. Go ahead.

52:28.513 --> 52:31.747
- Why do you feel stupid,
though?

52:31.749 --> 52:36.252
- 'Cause I just feel like
I didn't do my best.

52:36.254 --> 52:39.255
In something like this,
you can't really fuck up.

52:39.257 --> 52:41.790
Like, I need this.
I really want this.

52:41.792 --> 52:44.760
- Right. You've been here
and you've held your own.

52:44.762 --> 52:48.130
- I just wanted to show more
'cause there's so much more.

52:48.132 --> 52:50.432
And I hope that
I get the opportunity,

52:50.434 --> 52:53.035
but if I don't, I get why.

52:53.037 --> 52:55.704
- I love you a lot.
- I love you, too.

52:57.775 --> 52:59.175
- I'm not gonna lie.

52:59.177 --> 53:00.409
There's definitely
a part of me

53:00.411 --> 53:03.345
that's enjoying
this potential power situation.

53:03.347 --> 53:04.847
- Girl, no!

53:04.849 --> 53:06.282
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

53:06.284 --> 53:08.651
It's just because I'm
so used to being terrified

53:08.653 --> 53:10.819
and, like, in the grip
of total anxiety here.

53:10.821 --> 53:12.221
And now I feel like...

53:14.458 --> 53:17.226
I have to say
there is a part of me

53:17.228 --> 53:20.296
that is very intrigued
and attracted

53:20.298 --> 53:23.165
and seduced
by this new power.

53:23.167 --> 53:24.934
(laughs)

53:24.936 --> 53:26.769
But I will do
the fair thing.

53:26.771 --> 53:28.404
- I just want to tell you,
you know,

53:28.406 --> 53:31.106
I want to prove how much
I'm a different person

53:31.108 --> 53:32.174
than I am from my season.

53:32.176 --> 53:33.409
- Uh-huh.

53:33.411 --> 53:35.578
- And I feel like my time
is too short still.

53:35.580 --> 53:37.112
I know I am in the bottom,

53:37.114 --> 53:40.883
and I felt like all I could do
was my runway today and--

53:40.885 --> 53:42.851
- It's not personal.
It's just we're all here.

53:42.853 --> 53:44.653
We're all professional
drag queens with careers,

53:44.655 --> 53:46.222
and we can evaluate
what's entertaining

53:46.224 --> 53:47.356
and what's not entertaining.

53:47.358 --> 53:50.025
- It's 50/50.
I could be going home.

53:50.027 --> 53:51.627
You never know how these girls
are gonna play the game,

53:51.629 --> 53:53.295
and I'm terrified.

53:53.297 --> 53:55.497
- Next!

53:57.702 --> 54:00.102
Tell me why you should be
America's next top model.

54:00.104 --> 54:02.538
- Oh, you...
(laughs)

54:02.540 --> 54:04.406
- I know you're feeling
terrible.

54:04.408 --> 54:06.475
- Yeah. I feel like...

54:06.477 --> 54:09.378
almost because
I am from an earlier season

54:09.380 --> 54:11.480
and I was so young
that I do--

54:11.482 --> 54:12.781
and I've been saying
this whole time,

54:12.783 --> 54:14.583
like, I don't have
to prove anything to anyone,

54:14.585 --> 54:16.385
but I kind of do.

54:16.387 --> 54:18.354
I thought I was on
a good roll here last week,

54:18.356 --> 54:20.522
and there's so much more
that I have

54:20.524 --> 54:22.891
that's, like, out of the box
and different for Tatianna

54:22.893 --> 54:24.793
that I want the world
to see

54:24.795 --> 54:26.862
and I kind of need
the world to see.

54:26.864 --> 54:30.566
This competition
means so much to me.

54:30.568 --> 54:31.967
I don't want to go home.

54:31.969 --> 54:34.970
I'm not ready to go home.

54:34.972 --> 54:37.373
I can't go home right now.

54:37.375 --> 54:38.440
- I knew coming in here

54:38.442 --> 54:40.242
that, like, everybody's
gonna be so good

54:40.244 --> 54:42.244
that it's just like you
don't know what the hell.

54:42.246 --> 54:44.813
From week to week, it's going
to be a complete roller coaster.

54:44.815 --> 54:47.383
- I don't want to make it,
like, harder on you,

54:47.385 --> 54:49.852
if you're feeling, like,
towards one way or another.

54:49.854 --> 54:51.453
Don't think that,
like, this is, like,

54:51.455 --> 54:52.554
trying to wane you,
'cause it's not.

54:52.556 --> 54:53.522
- No, no, no.
'Cause I know you.

54:53.524 --> 54:54.523
- 'Cause it's not.

54:54.525 --> 54:55.524
I would like
to really not have that.

54:55.526 --> 54:57.126
- Yeah, I know you.

54:57.128 --> 54:58.994
Here, give me a hug.

54:58.996 --> 55:01.030
- Can we get
a Code 69 progress?

55:01.032 --> 55:02.665
(all laugh)

55:02.667 --> 55:05.834
- Oh, silencio.
Silencio.

55:05.836 --> 55:10.372
Bring back my girls-uh.

55:17.848 --> 55:19.948
- If I win this lip sync,

55:19.950 --> 55:22.184
someone's going home
because of me.

55:24.789 --> 55:29.591
I've made up my mind,
but it's really hard

55:29.593 --> 55:32.361
having that decision
on my head.

55:34.665 --> 55:37.666
- I have to make the decision
about who to send home.

55:37.668 --> 55:40.669
It's really tough,
but it's still a competition

55:40.671 --> 55:42.371
and I have to make sure

55:42.373 --> 55:46.408
that every decision I make
is the right one.

55:49.280 --> 55:51.380
(RuPaul laughs)

55:52.583 --> 55:54.983
(RuPaul laughs)

55:59.056 --> 56:00.856
- Welcome back, ladies.

56:00.858 --> 56:04.660
Two top "All Stars"
stand before me.

56:04.662 --> 56:10.666
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me, win $10,000,

56:10.668 --> 56:12.935
and earn the power

56:12.937 --> 56:17.473
to give one of
the bottom queens the chop.

56:19.310 --> 56:22.311
The time has come
to lip sync

56:22.313 --> 56:27.316
(echoing)
for your legacy.

56:27.318 --> 56:29.618
- I'm excited to lip sync
against Alaska.

56:29.620 --> 56:31.920
I am feeling myself.

56:31.922 --> 56:34.957
I am preparing the world
to gag on my legacy,

56:34.959 --> 56:37.993
which involves
a line of platform jellies

56:37.995 --> 56:40.596
in every size,
color and shape.

56:40.598 --> 56:43.832
- I know that I really need
to turn it out.

56:43.834 --> 56:46.201
There's no question that
I want to win the lip sync.

56:46.203 --> 56:49.805
It's another opportunity
to impress the judges.

56:49.807 --> 56:51.740
- Good luck.

56:51.742 --> 56:53.609
Don't fuck it up.

56:53.611 --> 56:56.445
- ¶ Ah, freak out ¶

56:56.447 --> 56:58.046
¶ Le freak, c'est chic ¶

56:58.048 --> 57:00.449
¶ Freak out ¶

57:00.451 --> 57:05.087
¶ All that pressure
got you down ¶

57:05.089 --> 57:08.957
¶ Has your head
spinning all around ¶

57:08.959 --> 57:12.961
¶ Just come on down,
to 54 ¶

57:12.963 --> 57:15.497
¶ Find a spot
out on the floor ¶

57:15.499 --> 57:17.766
¶ Ah, freak out ¶

57:17.768 --> 57:21.904
- I am in the bottom with
two-thirds of Rolaskatox.

57:21.906 --> 57:25.140
So if Alaska
wins this lip sync,

57:25.142 --> 57:27.376
the chances are
I'm being sent home.

57:27.378 --> 57:29.778
- Whoo!

57:29.780 --> 57:31.346
- ¶ I said, freak ¶

57:31.348 --> 57:32.848
- I'm terrified.

57:32.850 --> 57:34.750
You never know how these girls
are gonna play the game.

57:34.752 --> 57:36.418
It's so early in it.

57:36.420 --> 57:39.121
Are they gonna eliminate
a bigger threat?

57:39.123 --> 57:41.190
- ¶ Now, freak ¶

57:48.799 --> 57:52.367
¶ All that pressure
got you down ¶

57:52.369 --> 57:56.705
¶ Just come on down
to 54 ¶

57:56.707 --> 57:59.475
¶ Find a spot
out on the floor ¶

57:59.477 --> 58:01.076
¶ Ah, freak out ¶

58:01.078 --> 58:02.311
(all laugh)

58:02.313 --> 58:03.846
¶ Le freak, c'est chic ¶

58:03.848 --> 58:05.447
¶ Freak out ¶

58:07.151 --> 58:09.318
¶ Ah, freak out ¶

58:09.320 --> 58:10.686
(all laugh)

58:10.688 --> 58:13.222
- Yeah!
(applause)

58:16.026 --> 58:19.862
- Ladies, I have made
my decision.

58:24.335 --> 58:28.036
Alaska,
you're a winner, baby.

58:28.038 --> 58:30.272
(applause)

58:30.274 --> 58:31.340
Con-drag-ulations.

58:31.342 --> 58:35.811
You've earned a cash tip
of $10,000.

58:35.813 --> 58:36.945
- Thank you.

58:36.947 --> 58:39.882
There is sort of
a bittersweet feeling right now,

58:39.884 --> 58:41.817
because I love
winning challenges,

58:41.819 --> 58:44.686
but it also means
I have to send somebody home.

58:44.688 --> 58:46.922
- Katya, you're safe.
- Thank you.

58:46.924 --> 58:49.024
- You may join
the other girls.

58:49.026 --> 58:52.861
(applause)

58:54.298 --> 58:58.233
Will the bottom three
please step forward?

59:05.342 --> 59:09.945
Alaska, with great power
comes great responsibility.

59:12.449 --> 59:17.152
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

59:18.188 --> 59:20.122
- Like you've said
many times,

59:20.124 --> 59:23.559
"RuPaul's Drag Race" is
a microcosm of the real world.

59:23.561 --> 59:24.927
And in the real world,

59:24.929 --> 59:27.996
sometimes we have to make
really difficult decisions,

59:27.998 --> 59:30.732
and tonight
is one of those times.

59:30.734 --> 59:33.235
I've taken
into consideration

59:33.237 --> 59:36.171
the performances
in the Snatch Game

59:36.173 --> 59:39.875
and on the main stage
and I've most importantly

59:39.877 --> 59:43.312
taken the judges critiques
into consideration tonight.

59:43.314 --> 59:44.746
(exhales)

59:44.748 --> 59:46.715
The queen
that I have chosen...

59:49.920 --> 59:51.753
Is Tatianna.

59:55.025 --> 59:57.492
- Tatianna.
- Yep.

59:57.494 --> 1:00:00.195
- As it is written,
so it shall be done.

1:00:00.197 --> 1:00:03.165
See me with them hands,
girl.

1:00:04.268 --> 1:00:07.936
Now sashay away.

1:00:07.938 --> 1:00:09.137
- Thank you.

1:00:09.139 --> 1:00:10.639
- Thank you.

1:00:10.641 --> 1:00:12.741
- Thanks.

1:00:12.743 --> 1:00:17.012
(applause)

1:00:17.014 --> 1:00:19.014
The most disappointing part

1:00:19.016 --> 1:00:21.583
about being eliminated
this early in the competition

1:00:21.585 --> 1:00:23.785
is definitely
I don't have the ability

1:00:23.787 --> 1:00:27.522
to show everything
that I have to offer.

1:00:27.524 --> 1:00:29.091
Not just
in the way of clothing,

1:00:29.093 --> 1:00:32.361
but I have a lot more
personality and talent

1:00:32.363 --> 1:00:34.229
that I didn't get the chance
to feature.

1:00:36.600 --> 1:00:38.700
- Con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:00:38.702 --> 1:00:42.170
Keep freaking me out
and you could find yourself

1:00:42.172 --> 1:00:44.573
in the "Drag Race"
hall of fame.

1:00:44.575 --> 1:00:47.809
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1:00:47.811 --> 1:00:49.811
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1:00:49.813 --> 1:00:51.546
Can I get an amen
up in here?

1:00:51.548 --> 1:00:52.547
- Amen.
- Amen.

1:00:52.549 --> 1:00:54.516
- Now, let the music play.

1:00:54.518 --> 1:00:56.318
- ¶ Throw your hands up ¶

1:00:56.320 --> 1:00:58.453
¶ Time to get down ¶

1:00:58.455 --> 1:01:02.758
¶ Time to get down,
down, down, down, down ¶

1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:05.727
- I would say to Ru, thank you
so much for having me again.

1:01:05.729 --> 1:01:08.597
It was great seeing you
and your, uh...

1:01:08.599 --> 1:01:10.165
(alarm)

1:01:10.167 --> 1:01:12.234
- Ooh, girl.

1:01:12.236 --> 1:01:16.004
Tatianna, girl,
all is not lost,

1:01:16.006 --> 1:01:18.040
so stay thirsty, girl,

1:01:18.042 --> 1:01:21.610
'cause you still
have a chance to return

1:01:21.612 --> 1:01:24.913
for your revenge.

1:01:24.915 --> 1:01:26.214
- Are you serious?

1:01:26.216 --> 1:01:29.751
- (evil laugh)

1:01:31.355 --> 1:01:34.489
Wait, does this mean
I get to come back?

1:01:34.491 --> 1:01:36.525
I can.
