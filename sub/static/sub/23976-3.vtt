WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.449
All right. It's Christmas night.

00:04.105 --> 00:05.315
Spike that egg nog
and grab the wife,

00:05.339 --> 00:06.607
'cause there's trouble brewin'.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.540
Hi.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.377
Hey.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.555
I thought I lost you.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.927
You snore.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.731
I'm sorry.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.900
Bad.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.803
Yeah.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.772
Could be worse.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.940
No, it couldn't.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.976
It really couldn't.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.317
I came to find you.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.521
I know.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.458
I knew you would.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.360
Yeah?

03:55.869 --> 03:58.639
I want you back, Florida.

04:02.310 --> 04:05.613
And I don't just mean
to LaBorde.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.448
Hap.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.917
Don't... Shh.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.853
Don't.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.022
Don't say it.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.866
Why are you still holding on?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.643
Hap.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.745
You have to help me.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.792
God!

04:53.827 --> 04:56.730
God, don't be dead, Florida.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.766
God.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.915
You seen Leonard?

05:14.948 --> 05:16.450
Saw him this morning.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.619
Said to tell you
he's going to the Southside.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.888
Said not to
even try to follow him.

05:20.921 --> 05:24.492
Said the generator's
on the fritz all night.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.561
Figured, on account of
all the rain we've been havin'.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.531
So you brought a hammer?

05:30.564 --> 05:32.500
To fix generator?

05:32.533 --> 05:34.468
And gas.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.737
Sometimes water
gets in the fuel tank.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.672
Water and gas don't mix.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.609
You ever been fishing
or to a marina?

05:41.642 --> 05:44.978
You know how the gas greases up
all along the top of the water

05:45.012 --> 05:46.956
like some kind of swirlin'-ass
rainbow daydream... Tim.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.482
Where you got
your eyes wide open

05:48.516 --> 05:49.726
and you're staring at the...
Tim.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.785
Sky. Sorry.

05:51.819 --> 05:54.722
Lack of company
gets me downright gabby.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.557
You fix my car yet?

05:56.590 --> 05:57.791
Almost.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.998
I'm gonna need a loaner then.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.768
Okay. Sure. I can fix you up.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.443
Thanks.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.093
Where's your boyfriend?

06:33.126 --> 06:36.797
Good to know you hold me
in such high esteem.

06:36.830 --> 06:40.100
To think that Leonard
might be my type.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.475
Yes! Finally!

06:47.508 --> 06:49.977
Hey!

06:50.010 --> 06:51.579
Talkin' to you.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.583
You know that old black man
that work at the diner?

06:55.616 --> 06:57.117
Y'all seen him? Yes, sir.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.086
You know where I can find him?

07:04.792 --> 07:07.895
I know where he at right now!

07:07.928 --> 07:09.463
Can you take me to him?

07:09.497 --> 07:11.799
Okay. Follow me
'cause I know where he at.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.534
I do, too. No, you don't!

07:13.567 --> 07:14.635
Yes, I do!

07:54.908 --> 07:58.178
Hey! Wait up for us!

07:58.211 --> 08:00.247
We're going to find Bacon!

08:43.323 --> 08:48.228
I don't suppose you got
any news about Florida Grange.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.566
No.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.835
But then...

08:56.136 --> 08:58.538
I am busy.

09:00.841 --> 09:04.277
Giving out parking tickets.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.246
You on some kind of quota?

09:08.148 --> 09:12.252
You got some attitude on you
this morning.

09:12.285 --> 09:16.323
I didn't sleep too good
last night.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.325
How long you planning
on staying here?

09:18.358 --> 09:21.228
Wait. RRemind me,
are you Collins or Pine?

09:21.261 --> 09:23.163
Collins, and that depends.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.765
On what?

09:24.798 --> 09:28.568
A lot of things, Officer...

09:32.640 --> 09:34.875
Reynolds.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.385
You like what you see?

09:47.120 --> 09:50.658
You got a nice cover.

09:50.691 --> 09:54.127
I don't know
if I want to read the book.

09:54.161 --> 09:57.230
How about
just reading the synopsis?

09:57.264 --> 10:00.167
I would if I could, but I can't.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.870
So I won't.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.238
I don't have my glasses.

10:08.742 --> 10:12.379
You know, in Alaska,

10:12.412 --> 10:15.983
it is legal
for law enforcement officers

10:16.016 --> 10:20.654
to have sexual contact with
individuals under investigation.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.826
Am I?

10:25.859 --> 10:28.161
Under investigation?

10:30.430 --> 10:32.399
You could be.

10:49.449 --> 10:52.085
Somethin' goin' on down there.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.353
No.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.689
Don't pay no attention to him.

10:55.723 --> 10:58.258
Sonofabitch
got a mind of his own.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.175
Let's go.

11:42.069 --> 11:45.038
Why do I have the feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore?

11:45.072 --> 11:46.907
'Cause we're in East Texas.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.342
And Mr. Brown wants to meet you.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.111
Have fun.

12:24.144 --> 12:27.781
I think I liked you more
before I got to know you.

12:27.815 --> 12:30.183
You don't know me.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.948
Well, we was just, just
a little "Double Dutch Bus."

13:34.982 --> 13:36.449
Yeah.

14:30.437 --> 14:33.240
The day they gave me that...

14:33.273 --> 14:38.045
I carried Doshan
two and a half miles on my back.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.446
Talked Brady down

14:39.479 --> 14:42.515
when he stepped on that snake
in the rice paddy.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.085
Kept their eyes up.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.954
Their minds right.

14:46.987 --> 14:51.158
Got all eight of those men
back to the LZ.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.359
Hell, the only difference

14:52.392 --> 14:53.669
between livin'
and dyin' that day...

14:53.693 --> 14:56.063
was me.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.931
I remember.

14:57.965 --> 15:01.168
But ain't me no more, brother.

15:01.201 --> 15:05.005
The man you was then...

15:05.038 --> 15:06.940
ain't this man.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.517
Hello. Can we help you?

16:02.662 --> 16:05.632
You illiterate,
or you just can't read?

16:05.665 --> 16:07.667
What's the difference?

16:07.700 --> 16:10.270
Context, boy.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.672
I got your context right here.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.375
Then why's your black ass
still here?

16:15.408 --> 16:19.246
I'm here on account of
I ain't found my friend yet.-

16:19.279 --> 16:20.780
Yeah, getting yourself killed

16:20.813 --> 16:23.383
ain't gonna change
what already happened to her.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.652
Ol' Uncle Tom's
scared to pull a scab?

16:25.685 --> 16:28.255
Shh.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.722
Get off of me. Get off of me!

16:29.756 --> 16:34.061
Uncle Tom, bullshit.

16:34.094 --> 16:37.130
I didn't go up and down Italy
shooting Nazis,

16:37.164 --> 16:38.565
come back as an old man,

16:38.598 --> 16:41.068
and have somebody callin' me
names like Uncle Tom.

16:41.101 --> 16:44.804
Well, I didn't serve in Nam
killing all them gooks

16:44.837 --> 16:48.241
so that you can come back and cook
breakfast for the Klan, neither.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.110
Why does it
always have to be a fight

16:50.143 --> 16:52.812
in order to solve a problem?

16:52.845 --> 16:55.148
Son, I learned a long time ago

16:55.182 --> 16:58.418
you can solve more problems
without pulling the trigger.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.390
Then if what you said is true,

17:03.423 --> 17:06.126
if something happened
to Florida, she dead,

17:06.159 --> 17:07.460
somebody gonna pay.

17:07.493 --> 17:08.728
All right.

17:08.761 --> 17:12.165
You wanna die,
you die for something.

17:12.199 --> 17:15.734
One of them Klan boys
put a bullet in your head,

17:15.768 --> 17:19.606
now you've died for nothing.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.648
You gave
ol' Boone and Grady there

17:28.681 --> 17:31.851
a pretty good drubbing
yesterday.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.187
Hard to look good
in them Christmas pictures

17:34.221 --> 17:35.788
with all them bruises
you put on them.

17:35.822 --> 17:39.192
They had it coming.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.294
Well, I know these two
pretty well,

17:41.328 --> 17:45.165
and you might be right.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.267
Still...

17:47.300 --> 17:50.703
an apology'd go a long way.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.872
As a first step.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.707
What's the second step?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.776
Paying for their kindergarten?

18:00.847 --> 18:04.584
We got a real nice town here
with real nice people.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.519
Last thing we need
is you comin' down here,

18:06.553 --> 18:07.887
creatin' all sorts of problems.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.124
I'm just down here
lookin' for my friend.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.626
I don't suppose
any of you inbreds

18:13.660 --> 18:16.829
know where I might find her?

18:21.201 --> 18:23.170
Watch your back.

18:23.203 --> 18:27.840
That girl you're looking for
ruffled a lot of feathers.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.777
That girl is a lawyer.

18:30.810 --> 18:33.846
And that's what they do.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.717
Even lady lawyers.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.887
Even black lady lawyers.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.789
You know,
I'll be the first to admit

18:42.822 --> 18:44.691
some of this
we brought on ourselves.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.726
To begin with,

18:46.759 --> 18:49.596
we might should've decided
to pick our own cotton.

18:52.232 --> 18:55.168
If I want to live
around Negroes,

18:55.202 --> 18:57.204
I'd move to Africa.

18:59.306 --> 19:02.375
This here is America.

19:02.409 --> 19:03.810
It's just a hunch,

19:03.843 --> 19:05.912
but I'm guessing you never asked
an American Indian

19:05.945 --> 19:07.780
how they might feel about that.

19:09.516 --> 19:13.520
God put the white man
in charge for a reason.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.198
But I guess you wouldn't know
anything about that.

19:15.222 --> 19:19.559
You probably haven't read
your Bible in a while.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.961
You pretend you don't know
what I'm talking about,

19:21.994 --> 19:22.962
but watch the news.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.764
Niggers are everywhere.

19:24.797 --> 19:27.267
In sports, music, space...

19:27.300 --> 19:28.635
Hell, even in Congress.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.404
Anywhere there's
a white man's job to be had,

19:31.438 --> 19:34.407
you dogooders
want to give it to them.

19:34.441 --> 19:38.811
You are an ugly man
with ugly ideas

19:38.845 --> 19:41.948
and no amount of hiding
behind that Bible of yours

19:41.981 --> 19:43.483
is gonna change that.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.419
These people actually
think they deserve

19:46.453 --> 19:48.555
to eat, sleep, shit, and shop
where we do.

19:48.588 --> 19:49.922
Now, you believe that?

19:49.956 --> 19:52.659
I can't believe you don't.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.227
Tell you what.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.828
It's Christmas

19:55.862 --> 19:58.498
and, I'm feeling generous.

19:58.531 --> 20:02.769
So I'll pay
for Boone's truck there.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.804
But you just
get that nigger out of here

20:04.837 --> 20:06.973
before something happens
I can't take back.

20:25.057 --> 20:28.261
You know, hey,
while I'm here and...

20:28.295 --> 20:30.897
and you're there...

20:30.930 --> 20:33.866
maybe you can
enlighten something for me.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.506
What is it you people want,

20:39.539 --> 20:42.809
What does your world look like?

20:44.811 --> 20:47.780
It's white.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.650
But what is it you want?

20:53.853 --> 20:58.725
I know you can tear shit down.

20:58.758 --> 21:02.495
What is it you intend to build?

21:04.631 --> 21:07.900
I'd just be wasting my breath.

21:12.004 --> 21:14.941
You have no idea, do you?

21:21.781 --> 21:23.383
You're still here tomorrow,

21:23.416 --> 21:25.518
don't say I didn't warn you.

21:27.554 --> 21:29.689
Right.

21:55.948 --> 21:58.951
Can I help you, sir?

21:58.985 --> 22:01.854
Excuse me.
You can't go back there.

22:01.888 --> 22:04.357
What do you think you're doing?

22:09.996 --> 22:11.798
Well, you must be
hard of hearing.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.967
I thought I told you
to pack up lover boy and scram.

22:15.001 --> 22:18.705
I think Truman Brown,
or his people...

22:18.738 --> 22:22.675
I think they killed
Bobby Joe Soothe.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.677
And I think
when Florida came down here

22:24.711 --> 22:25.978
and started diggin' that up,

22:26.012 --> 22:29.849
I think they killed her, too.

22:29.882 --> 22:33.386
What makes you think I give
a good goddamn what you think?

22:33.420 --> 22:37.557
I drove that girl to the city
limits myself Christmas Eve day.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.726
They got a chipper out there.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.394
They're a tree farm.

22:41.428 --> 22:42.795
They can disappear people,

22:42.829 --> 22:45.532
and don't tell me they can't.

22:45.565 --> 22:46.966
There's the door.

22:46.999 --> 22:49.101
Close it behind you
when you get out of here.

22:59.512 --> 23:02.915
I got this figured
one of two ways.

23:02.949 --> 23:05.552
You're part of it.

23:05.585 --> 23:08.888
You and your people.
Officer Reynolds there.

23:08.921 --> 23:12.759
Part of the murder
and part of the coverup.

23:12.792 --> 23:15.194
Or...

23:15.227 --> 23:17.897
you're stupid and lazy

23:17.930 --> 23:21.734
and just racist enough
to turn the other way.

23:21.768 --> 23:25.037
I see. Okay.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.740
You think you're better than me?

23:27.774 --> 23:30.477
I get it, you probably think
you're smarter than me, too.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.745
Smalltown cop
with a ruptured turnip.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.981
Well, let me tell you
somethin', boy.

23:35.014 --> 23:38.551
I do my job,
and I am the opposite of lazy!

23:38.585 --> 23:41.588
Then why the hell have
you done nothing...

23:41.621 --> 23:44.023
Nothing! To help me
find Florida Grange?

23:44.056 --> 23:46.459
I already told you
she ain't here no more,

23:46.493 --> 23:47.794
and there's no more to it!

23:47.827 --> 23:50.062
She ain't anywhere no more!

23:50.096 --> 23:51.864
This is what I'm sayin'!

24:00.540 --> 24:02.909
I tell you what, why don't you
head on over to Southside?

24:02.942 --> 24:05.077
You'll find
your lawyer friend over there

24:05.111 --> 24:08.515
holed up with some young buck,
cornholin' like they do.

24:10.850 --> 24:15.488
You wouldn't say that
if you knew her.

24:15.522 --> 24:18.825
So, Sneed was right
about you and the lawyer.

24:18.858 --> 24:21.694
And some detective named Hanson.

24:25.732 --> 24:27.767
Foxes tend to go to the ground

24:27.800 --> 24:31.103
when the hounds are after them,
Mr. Collins.

24:31.137 --> 24:34.774
Your girlfriend will show up
when she wants to be found,

24:34.807 --> 24:36.743
but not before.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.254
Grandson?

24:53.059 --> 24:54.827
Son.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.796
How old?

24:56.829 --> 24:58.731
How old is dead?

25:03.069 --> 25:04.070
I'm sorry.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.672
Get out.

25:35.735 --> 25:37.269
Are you feeling out of shape?

25:37.303 --> 25:40.006
Has the flame gone out
of your love life?

25:40.039 --> 25:41.340
Do you feel like you're carrying

25:41.373 --> 25:42.875
two tubs of rinse in the back...

25:44.110 --> 25:45.945
Need a lift, stranger?

25:50.950 --> 25:52.985
Thanks.

25:53.019 --> 25:56.288
That girl sure does get around.

25:56.322 --> 25:58.024
Her name's Belinda.

25:59.859 --> 26:02.328
She disappeared
about five years ago.

26:02.361 --> 26:05.064
She was about 11 then.

26:05.097 --> 26:08.334
She was gone for months, and
everybody thought she was dead.

26:08.367 --> 26:10.603
Then one day,

26:10.637 --> 26:12.171
she just
walked out of the Thicket,

26:12.204 --> 26:14.140
skinny but alive.

26:14.173 --> 26:17.243
What happened to her?

26:17.276 --> 26:19.679
Nobody knows.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.817
I'm convinced there ain't nothin'
that goes on in Grovetown

26:24.851 --> 26:26.653
that girl don't know about.

26:26.686 --> 26:29.922
In that case, would you mind
if I asked her a few questions

26:29.956 --> 26:32.358
about the friend I'm lookin'
for?

26:32.391 --> 26:37.029
You can ask, but whatever she
knows is gonna die with her.

26:37.063 --> 26:39.031
She...

26:39.065 --> 26:41.376
Girl ain't uttered a word since
she came out of them woods.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.804
Not a "Hey,"
or a "How you doin'?"

26:44.837 --> 26:46.706
Nothin'.

26:51.911 --> 26:54.346
Hey.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.348
I'm glad to see you're not dead.

26:56.382 --> 26:59.151
You smell dead.

26:59.185 --> 27:00.987
Yeah. I had a close encounter

27:01.020 --> 27:02.955
with the head of the Klan
down here.

27:02.989 --> 27:05.925
He told me to get you out of
here or there'd be hell to pay.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.727
And what did you say?

27:07.760 --> 27:09.395
I told him to go fuck himself.

27:09.428 --> 27:10.396
Good.

27:10.429 --> 27:13.766
You seen Cantuck? Yeah.

27:13.800 --> 27:17.704
He said he took Florida
to the edge of town,

27:17.737 --> 27:19.972
watched her drive away himself.

27:20.006 --> 27:22.008
In other words,
she ain't his problem.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.310
No.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.812
What about you?

27:25.845 --> 27:28.114
You found the cook?

27:28.147 --> 27:30.382
Found him at church.

27:30.416 --> 27:33.385
His name is Bacon. You know,

27:33.419 --> 27:36.689
that is one thing...

27:36.723 --> 27:38.224
I will never understand,

27:38.257 --> 27:41.027
is why black folks
still believe,

27:41.060 --> 27:42.829
given what's happening.

27:42.862 --> 27:45.832
Given what's always
been happening.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.166
See, the church
is the only thing

27:47.199 --> 27:50.803
the white man won't take
from the black man.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.104
You understand that?

27:54.206 --> 27:57.443
I try.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.779
Bacon's seen her

27:59.812 --> 28:01.447
at Blind Tillie's.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.921
Who around here do you think
might want to hurt him?

28:08.955 --> 28:12.191
Says she was asking questions
about Bobby Joe Soothe.

28:12.224 --> 28:14.060
When was that?

28:14.093 --> 28:15.995
Christmas Eve night.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.030
Christmas Eve night?
That's what he said.

28:18.064 --> 28:20.332
Cantuck said
she left Christmas Eve day.

28:20.366 --> 28:21.834
Someone's lying.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.903
Hap, it's Grovetown.
Someone always lyin'.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.240
Blind Tillie's?

28:28.274 --> 28:29.341
Let's go.

28:32.111 --> 28:33.445
I got to find a phone.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.447
I'll call Bacon,
tell him to meet us there.

28:38.918 --> 28:41.153
Got her done. Filled the tank.

28:41.187 --> 28:42.955
She's good to go.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.767
You boys need anything else
before you take off?

28:44.791 --> 28:47.393
Who said we was takin' off?
Snacks

28:47.426 --> 28:50.062
I just figured...
Well, you figured wrong.

28:50.096 --> 28:53.399
Okay. You sure y'all
don't want to just go on and go?

28:53.432 --> 28:54.433
Boy, look at me.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.135
Is the Pope black?

28:56.168 --> 28:57.970
Well...

28:58.004 --> 28:59.505
What he means is,

28:59.538 --> 29:01.941
does the Pope shit in the woods?

29:01.974 --> 29:04.476
Well, I can't rightly say
I ever thought about that.

29:04.510 --> 29:07.379
There you go. Now we sure.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.994
God!

30:28.027 --> 30:29.495
Shit!

30:32.298 --> 30:35.067
You're lucky
my dogs aren't out, Chief.

30:35.101 --> 30:36.468
Goddamn it, Truman.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.938
You like to give me
a heart attack.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.406
What can I do for you?

30:40.439 --> 30:43.910
Looking into the
disappearance of that lawyer,

30:43.943 --> 30:45.611
the one you run in with
at Maude's.

30:49.415 --> 30:52.985
You lookin' for a suspect...

30:53.019 --> 30:54.586
killer, or somebody to blame?

30:54.620 --> 30:57.289
I'm the Chief of
the goddamn Police Department.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.658
This is my town.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.461
I'm the one who stays awake at
night shit happens around here,

31:02.494 --> 31:04.363
so you do not mess with me.

31:06.332 --> 31:09.635
Niggers missing and shit.
That's what we're talking about?

31:09.668 --> 31:12.038
That gal from LaBorde,

31:12.071 --> 31:14.240
she's an officer of the court.

31:14.273 --> 31:18.277
She don't exist in a vacuum,
you dimwit.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.446
Folks are gonna come looking
for her.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.548
Folks already
come lookin' for her.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.450
What's that got to do with me?

31:24.483 --> 31:27.053
You ain't above the law,
is what I'm saying.

31:28.988 --> 31:31.457
Turn the lights out
when you're done, Chief.

31:51.210 --> 31:52.678
When I was in Saigon,

31:52.711 --> 31:55.181
I used to hang out at a club
that remind me of this place.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.653
You ever think about dyin', Hap?

32:03.289 --> 32:06.292
I try not to.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.027
Why?

32:08.060 --> 32:10.529
Bobby Joe dead.

32:12.731 --> 32:14.300
Florida dead, too.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.235
Maybe.

32:16.268 --> 32:19.305
What's your point?

32:19.338 --> 32:21.607
Maybe Sonny Knox was right.

32:21.640 --> 32:24.176
Maybe the curse is real,
and we next.

32:24.210 --> 32:26.212
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.

32:26.245 --> 32:30.016
The curse ain't real.

32:30.049 --> 32:33.986
That's the same thing
you said about mojo.

32:34.020 --> 32:36.122
Well...

32:36.155 --> 32:39.658
I ain't leaving
till we find her.

32:39.691 --> 32:44.030
Boy, you sure is holdin' on
tight to somethin'.

32:52.504 --> 32:55.441
You brought him?

32:55.474 --> 32:58.244
His car.

32:58.277 --> 33:00.579
You see that sign over there?

33:00.612 --> 33:03.682
"No Honkies Allowed."

33:03.715 --> 33:06.018
You bring me out
a couple of hardboiled eggs

33:06.052 --> 33:07.253
and a bag of chips,

33:07.286 --> 33:10.589
and I'll watch over your car,
too.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.838
Damn!

34:15.821 --> 34:17.755
Where'd you get this?

34:19.858 --> 34:22.161
It belongs to a friend of mine.

34:24.230 --> 34:25.231
You seen her?

34:27.399 --> 34:29.368
You know where she is?

34:34.739 --> 34:36.775
Hey!

34:36.808 --> 34:38.476
Hey!

34:38.510 --> 34:40.612
Hey!

34:44.750 --> 34:47.253
Florida?

35:16.748 --> 35:19.718
Florida?

35:19.751 --> 35:21.863
What the hell, man? I'm sorry. I'm
sorry, man. I thought it someone else.

35:21.887 --> 35:26.225
Just be cool. Sorry.

35:26.258 --> 35:27.593
What the hell is wrong with you?

35:27.626 --> 35:30.196
I thought it was Florida.

35:30.229 --> 35:32.264
Florida?

35:32.298 --> 35:33.741
Look, I'ma tell you this
as your friend.

35:33.765 --> 35:36.635
You better get your head right.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.845
I remember that girl.

35:46.878 --> 35:49.615
Florida her name.

35:49.648 --> 35:52.184
She was interested
in Bobby Joe Soothe.

35:52.218 --> 35:54.686
Asked all kinds of questions
about him.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.422
Let's see, this was...

35:56.455 --> 35:58.657
When was this, Cleavon?

35:58.690 --> 35:59.858
Christmas Eve.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.893
My night off.

36:01.927 --> 36:03.962
Which is why
I was none too happy

36:03.995 --> 36:06.498
to be answering her questions.

36:06.532 --> 36:08.534
Miss Tillie.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.469
Florida kin to me.

36:10.502 --> 36:13.205
You ain't got not idea
where she might could be?

36:13.239 --> 36:15.674
What do I look like to you, 911?

36:15.707 --> 36:18.810
Cleavon, do I look like 911?

36:18.844 --> 36:21.513
No, ma'am.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.815
See, we just thought...

36:23.849 --> 36:26.352
You thought what, white boy?

36:26.385 --> 36:31.223
We just thought that maybe,
you hear things.

36:31.257 --> 36:33.225
I'ma tell you...

36:33.259 --> 36:35.427
just like I told her.

36:35.461 --> 36:37.996
I do hear things.

36:38.029 --> 36:43.269
But there's a difference between
what I hear and what I know.

36:43.302 --> 36:45.571
And what I know

36:45.604 --> 36:48.707
is you ask too many questions
about the dead,

36:48.740 --> 36:51.243
you like to join 'em.

36:53.445 --> 36:57.883
Well.
Well, what about you, Cleavon?

36:57.916 --> 36:59.485
Did you hear anything

36:59.518 --> 37:02.488
that we might want to know
something about?

37:04.823 --> 37:07.326
That girl...

37:07.359 --> 37:10.329
was lookin'
for them Bobby Joe tapes.

37:10.362 --> 37:12.964
You find who got them tapes,

37:12.998 --> 37:15.000
you just might find that girl.

37:15.033 --> 37:17.369
Well, did Florida
at least tell you

37:17.403 --> 37:20.639
who she thought might have hung
Bobby Joe over the bridge?

37:20.672 --> 37:22.850
You think it could have been
someone from the Southside?

37:22.874 --> 37:28.314
Whatever misfortune
visits itself upon your friend,

37:28.347 --> 37:31.016
it ain't come
from this side of the tracks.

37:31.049 --> 37:35.287
You go on back over there
to Grovetown.

37:35.321 --> 37:39.925
Pull that curtain back
just a smidgeon,

37:39.958 --> 37:42.694
and you'll see evil.

37:42.728 --> 37:46.298
Look behind there.

37:46.332 --> 37:48.867
That's where your girl be.

37:55.674 --> 37:57.376
All right.

39:48.487 --> 39:50.188
Hey.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.458
I got given this.

39:52.491 --> 39:56.628
Belonged to Florida.

39:56.662 --> 39:58.163
From who?

39:58.196 --> 40:01.533
This weird young girl, Belinda.

40:01.567 --> 40:02.801
Did she say where Florida was?

40:02.834 --> 40:04.870
No. She don't talk.

40:04.903 --> 40:09.675
No, she... she never spoke
a word for years.

40:09.708 --> 40:12.511
How you know all of that?

40:12.544 --> 40:15.881
Because people talk to me,
Leonard.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.517
Look what happened back
at Blind Tillie's.

40:18.550 --> 40:22.153
She took one look at me,
couldn't stop talking.

40:22.187 --> 40:24.723
Friendly face, I guess.

40:25.924 --> 40:28.059
We have to find this girl, Hap.

40:28.093 --> 40:30.962
No, I told you, she don't talk.

40:30.996 --> 40:33.565
No, I know she don't talk,
but maybe she write.

40:33.599 --> 40:35.934
You ever think of that? Yeah.

40:35.967 --> 40:40.105
See, that... that is why you
and me make such a great team.

40:40.138 --> 40:42.040
I'm the pretty one,
and you're the smart one.

40:42.073 --> 40:44.009
No, no. I'm the pretty
and the smart one.

40:44.042 --> 40:46.478
You just...

40:48.179 --> 40:50.682
What the...

40:50.716 --> 40:52.951
What the hell was that?
I don't know!

40:52.984 --> 40:55.954
Shit! Shit!
I told you we was cursed.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.255
There ain't no goddamn curse!

40:57.288 --> 40:59.090
Start the car! I'm trying!

40:59.124 --> 41:00.191
Come on! I'm trying!

41:02.260 --> 41:04.663
Move! Get out! Get out!

41:19.044 --> 41:21.079
Jesus Christ!

41:21.112 --> 41:25.784
Run! We got to get out! Get out!

41:28.086 --> 41:30.288
I told you we was cursed!

41:30.321 --> 41:31.557
Run!

41:42.133 --> 41:44.002
Think we missed 'em, boss.

41:48.607 --> 41:50.909
Well, life's not fair, boys.

41:50.942 --> 41:54.145
But God is always faithful.

41:54.179 --> 41:55.747
They're in the Thicket now.

41:56.305 --> 42:02.244
