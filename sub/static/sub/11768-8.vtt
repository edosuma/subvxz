00:35.733 --> 00:37.933
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT ?
IT WAS CHERYL'S AUNT.

00:37.967 --> 00:39.567
BUT THANK YOU.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.433
DID YOU FLY IN
FROM FLORIDA ?

00:41.467 --> 00:42.833
NO, NO, NO,

00:42.867 --> 00:45.067
HER SISTER AND
HER SISTER'S BOYFRIEND
AND HER PARENTS FLEW IN.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.200
I LIVE HERE.

00:46.233 --> 00:47.267
OH, I SEE.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.367

00:55.867 --> 00:57.033

00:58.333 --> 01:00.600
THANKS FOR

01:00.633 --> 01:02.067
I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:02.100 --> 01:03.933
PLEASE,

01:03.967 --> 01:05.767
IT'S, UH, I WAS
GONNA ASK YOU,

01:05.800 --> 01:07.567
IS THAT MINI BAR,

01:07.600 --> 01:10.100
IS THAT INCLUDED
WITH THE WHOLE THING ?

01:10.133 --> 01:11.300
SURE, WHATEVER
YOU WANT.

01:11.333 --> 01:12.367
OH, GREAT.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.433
YEAH,
HELP YOURSELF.

01:13.467 --> 01:16.267
SOME M&M's, YOU KNOW,
TOBLERONE.

01:16.300 --> 01:17.767
I DON'T DRINK.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.533
IT'S CHOCOLATE.

01:21.100 --> 01:23.133
HOW'S, UH, HOW'S
CHERYL HOLDING UP ?

01:23.167 --> 01:25.067
I THINK
SHE'S OKAY.

01:25.067 --> 01:26.300
YEAH.

01:26.333 --> 01:28.933
CUT MY FINGER THIS MORNING
TRYING TO PUT THAT, UH,

01:28.967 --> 01:30.800
MAKE A HOLE
IN MY BELT.

01:30.833 --> 01:33.867
SO I MUST HAVE
LOST WEIGHT OR SOMETHING.

01:33.900 --> 01:35.467
IT'S KILLING ME.

01:38.267 --> 01:40.767
WELL, UH,
IT'S A GOOD FAMILY.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.433
YEAH,
THEY'RE VERY NICE.

01:42.467 --> 01:44.067
BECKY'S
A NICE GIRL, RIGHT ?

01:44.067 --> 01:46.867
BECKY ? YEAH, SHE'S A DOLL,
SHE'S REALLY SWEET.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.833
HOW, HOW LONG
DID YOU DATE BEFORE

01:48.867 --> 01:51.500
YOU AND CHERYL
GOT MARRIED ?

01:53.067 --> 01:54.933
NOT THAT LONG,
REALLY.

01:54.967 --> 01:57.467
WE WERE FRIENDS FOR AWHILE
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,

01:57.500 --> 02:01.367
AFTER WE HAD INTERCOURSE
WE GOT MARRIED VERY QUICKLY.

02:02.467 --> 02:04.600
BECKY REALLY
WANTS TO GET MARRIED.

02:06.433 --> 02:10.500
AND UH, I'M JUST NOT,
I'M NOT INTO IT.

02:10.533 --> 02:13.867
AND, UH, THE DAY
THAT WE GOT THE CALL,

02:13.900 --> 02:15.500
I WAS ACTUALLY
GONNA BREAK UP,

02:15.533 --> 02:18.700
I WAS OVER THERE
TO BREAK UP WITH BECKY.

02:18.733 --> 02:21.600
HOLY COW, SO YOU
FLEW OUT HERE

02:21.633 --> 02:24.433
AND YOU WANTED
TO ALREADY BE FREE.

02:24.467 --> 02:26.300
I MISSED IT...

02:26.333 --> 02:29.133
LIKE, BY
FIVE MINUTES.

02:29.167 --> 02:30.467
OH, MY GOSH.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.800
AND THEN YOU COULDN'T DO IT
AFTER SHE KILLED HERSELF.

02:33.833 --> 02:36.667
WHAT DO THINK WOULD BE
THE APPROPRIATE TIME

02:36.700 --> 02:39.300
FOR SOMEBODY
TO WAIT 'TIL THEY... ?

02:39.333 --> 02:40.367
UH-HUH.

02:40.400 --> 02:43.067
'TIL I TELL HER ?

02:43.100 --> 02:45.533
IF IT WAS HER MOTHER,
I WOULD SAY YOU'D HAVE TO

02:45.567 --> 02:48.500
GO BACK ON THE PLANE
AND WAIT MAYBE SIX DAYS.

02:48.533 --> 02:50.267
A WEEK.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.367
FOR AN AUNT ?

02:52.400 --> 02:54.633
FOR AN AUNT WHO DOESN'T
EVEN LIVE WHERE YOU LIVE,

02:54.667 --> 02:57.200
WHO YOU DON'T
SEE THAT OFTEN,

02:57.233 --> 03:00.067
I THINK YOU COULD DO IT
WHEN YOU GET HOME,

03:00.067 --> 03:03.067
WHEN YOU GET BACK,
WHEN YOU GET BACK TO FLORIDA.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.600
WHAT SHOULD I SAY ?
I MEAN...

03:05.633 --> 03:07.500
JUST TELL HER
YOU'RE NOT HAPPY.

03:07.533 --> 03:08.867
THAT'S VERY GOOD,
THAT WORKS.

03:08.900 --> 03:11.867
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
USED IT MYSELF,
BUT I THINK IT WORKS.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.067
OKAY.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.500
I'VE GOT
A BREATH PROBLEM,
WHAT-- ?

03:14.533 --> 03:17.667
NO, I THOUGHT I SAW
A BUG, THAT'S CREEPY.

03:17.700 --> 03:20.433
ARIGHT, LISTEN, WE NEVER HAD
THIS CONVERSATION, BY THE WAY.

03:20.467 --> 03:21.967
NO.

03:22.067 --> 03:23.300
OKAY ?

03:23.333 --> 03:25.167
I WON'T
SAY ANYTHING.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.167
( fly buzzing )

03:27.200 --> 03:29.300
THANKS FOR
YOUR ADVICE.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.567
WOW, I THINK
I GOT THE HEAT, UH,

03:33.600 --> 03:35.667
TURNED DOWN A BIT.

03:35.700 --> 03:38.167
WHAT WERE YOU AND CRAIG
TALKING ABOUT ?

03:38.200 --> 03:39.433
LOUISE.

03:39.467 --> 03:40.467
IS HE OKAY ?

03:40.500 --> 03:41.933
OH, YEAH.

03:41.967 --> 03:44.600
YOU WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED
HOW BROKEN UP HE IS ABOUT THIS.

03:44.633 --> 03:45.967
HE'S BEEN VERY,
VERY QUIET FOR SEVERAL DAYS.

03:46.067 --> 03:47.100
THAT'S SO SWEET.

03:47.133 --> 03:50.300
THE SERVICE WAS WONDERFUL,
WASN'T IT ?

03:50.333 --> 03:51.600
YEAH, IT WORKED OUT
NICELY.

03:51.633 --> 03:52.767
WELL,
THANK YOU.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.133
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
HEY, LISTEN, YOU GUYS, UM,

03:55.167 --> 03:57.200
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
IF YOU WANT TO STAY

03:57.233 --> 03:58.667
A COUPLE OF EXTRA DAYS
IN THE HOUSE,

03:58.700 --> 04:00.233
THAT'S FINE,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

04:00.267 --> 04:04.433
YOU COULD STAY ANOTHER DAY
IN THE HOTEL.

04:04.467 --> 04:06.567
OH, THAT'S
REALLY NICE.

04:06.600 --> 04:07.967
STAY THERE
A NIGHT OR TWO.

04:08.067 --> 04:09.600
YEAH,
ONE NIGHT.

04:09.633 --> 04:10.933
THAT WOULD BE NICE,
BECAUSE WE HATE FLYING.

04:10.967 --> 04:11.933
NEITHER OF US
LIKE TO FLY.

04:11.967 --> 04:13.467
YEAH, HEY, NOBODY
LIKES TO FLY.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.600
I DON'T EVEN
LIKE TO DRIVE.

04:15.633 --> 04:17.367
AND I DON'T
LIKE WALKING.

04:17.400 --> 04:19.333
SO OCCASIONALLY,
I DON'T REALLY KNOW

04:19.367 --> 04:22.267
WHAT MODE OF
TRANSPORTATION TO--

04:22.300 --> 04:24.300
I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN
DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS,

04:24.333 --> 04:27.067
BUT WE WERE A LITTLE UPSET
THAT THERE WAS NO OBITUARY.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.433
OH, WOW, I DIDN'T EVEN
THINK OF THAT.

04:28.467 --> 04:31.300
LIKE SHE DIDN'T HAVE
A LIFE OUT HERE, YOU KNOW ?

04:31.333 --> 04:33.800
IT SORT OF
MAKES IT REAL.

04:33.833 --> 04:35.600
YOU KNOW, MY FRIEND,
UH, MY MANAGER

04:35.633 --> 04:37.367
ACTUALLY KNOWS
SOMEBODY AT THE PAPER.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.300
I'LL BET I COULD GET
SOMETHING IN THERE FOR YOU.

04:39.333 --> 04:40.433
THAT WOULD BE
SO GOOD.

04:40.467 --> 04:42.633
THAT'D BE
REALLY SWEET.

04:42.667 --> 04:44.367
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I'LL WRITE IT MYSELF.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.900
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE WHOLE THING.

04:45.933 --> 04:47.100
NO PROBLEM.

04:47.133 --> 04:48.400
THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO ADD,

04:48.433 --> 04:49.900
YOU JUST TELL ME ABOUT IT,
AND I'LL GET IT IN.

04:49.933 --> 04:51.867
IT'S NOT GONNA
BE FUNNY, IS IT ?

04:51.900 --> 04:52.933
MOM, PLEASE.

04:52.967 --> 04:55.067
( mom )
WELL, THAT'S
WHAT HE DOES.

04:55.067 --> 04:56.100
NO, IT'S NOT
GONNA BE FUNNY.

04:56.133 --> 04:57.867
IT'LL BE VERY TASTEFUL
AND APPROPRIATE.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.367
DON'T WORRY,
IT'LL BE FINE.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.467
HE'S JUST A WRITER,
HE CAN DO ANYTHING.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.633
THANK YOU
SO MUCH.

05:02.667 --> 05:04.667
WE LOVE YOU,
LARRY.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.367
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

05:12.900 --> 05:14.067
HEY.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.133
HEY !

05:15.167 --> 05:16.433
SORRY I'M LATE.

05:16.467 --> 05:17.900
HEY,
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

05:17.933 --> 05:20.933
IT'S VERY HARD TO EXTRICATE
MYSELF FROM WARNER'S.

05:20.967 --> 05:22.067
WHY ARE YOU STILL
WEARING THE TIE ?

05:22.100 --> 05:23.133
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WEAR IT ANYMORE.

05:23.167 --> 05:24.533
I DON'T KNOW.

05:24.567 --> 05:26.067
IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO,
I WOULDN'T.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.867
WELL, I MEAN, ONCE
YOU'VE GOT THE OUTFIT ON,

05:27.900 --> 05:31.100
YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST
WEAR IT TO ITS COMPLETION.

05:31.133 --> 05:32.300
MAINTAIN THE OUTFIT.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.467
"TO ITS COMPLETION."

05:33.500 --> 05:34.933
YEAH.

05:34.967 --> 05:36.800
HEY, SO YOU THINK
YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS,

05:36.833 --> 05:38.533
THIS OBITUARY THING ?

05:38.567 --> 05:39.733
REALLY ?
DONE DEAL, MAN.

05:39.767 --> 05:41.267
4:00 IS
THE DEADLINE.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.767
YOU GET IT TO ME BY 4:00
AND I'LL GET IT TO HIM.

05:43.800 --> 05:44.833
I'LL FAX IT OVER.

05:44.867 --> 05:46.167
NO PROBLEM.
THANKS SO MUCH.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.300
VERY NICE OF YOU.

05:47.333 --> 05:48.833
OH, WELL,
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

05:48.867 --> 05:50.800
THAT'LL SCORE SOME BIG POINTS
WITH THE FAMILY.

05:50.833 --> 05:52.267
HOW DID SHE DIE ?

05:52.300 --> 05:53.300
KILLED HERSELF.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.400
NO, SHE DIDN'T.

05:54.433 --> 05:55.667
KILLED HERSELF--

05:55.700 --> 05:56.733
WHY ?

05:56.767 --> 05:59.433
WHY ? NOBODY KNOWS,
SHE DIDN'T LEAVE A NOTE.

05:59.467 --> 06:00.600
THAT IS SO RUDE,
ISN'T THAT ?

06:00.633 --> 06:01.700
THAT'S REALLY RUDE.

06:01.733 --> 06:03.333
I MEAN, IF YOU LEAVE
YOUR HOUSE FOR 10 MINUTES

06:03.367 --> 06:05.067
TO GO GET
A CONTAINER OF MILK,

06:05.067 --> 06:06.867
YOU TELL SOMEBODY
WHERE YOU WENT, DON'T YOU ?

06:06.900 --> 06:08.867
I LEAVE MY WIFE A NOTE
BEFORE I GO ANYWHERE.

06:08.900 --> 06:11.700
YEAH, WOULD IT HAVE KILLED HER
TO LEAVE A NOTE ?

06:11.733 --> 06:12.700
I DON'T KNOW.

06:12.733 --> 06:15.467
UH, MY MOM'S IN TOWN
WITH MY DAD.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.767
IT'S HER BIRTHDAY.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.100
IT'D BE GREAT,

06:18.133 --> 06:20.133
CONSIDERING ALL THAT'S GONE DOWN
BETWEEN YOU AND MY PARENTS,

06:20.167 --> 06:22.900
IF, FOR MY MOM'S BIRTHDAY,
YOU GOT HER A LITTLE GIFT,
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

06:22.933 --> 06:25.967
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT IS,
IT'S A NICE GESTURE.

06:26.067 --> 06:27.667
IT REALLY IS.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.400
ANY IDEAS ?

06:31.800 --> 06:32.967
NO.

06:34.067 --> 06:35.433
OKAY.

06:35.467 --> 06:36.767
GOOD.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.067
HEY, LET'S DO THIS
OBITUARY THING, OKAY ?

06:38.067 --> 06:39.067
ALRIGHT.

06:39.100 --> 06:40.100
YOU HAVE A PAD ?

06:40.133 --> 06:42.067
OKAY.
YEAH, I GOT A PAD.

06:43.067 --> 06:44.633
UM, LOUISE HOENIN.

06:44.667 --> 06:46.433
H-O-E-N-I-N.

06:46.467 --> 06:49.200
DEVOTED SISTER,

06:49.233 --> 06:51.833
BELOVED AUNT.

06:52.700 --> 06:55.533
DIED OF
UNDISCLOSED CAUSES...

06:59.833 --> 07:02.700
IT ONLY TOOK US ABOUT
20 MINUTES, DOOR TO DOOR.

07:02.733 --> 07:04.167
DID VERY WELL.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.200
( male )
YEAH, THAT'S UNUSUAL.

07:05.233 --> 07:06.633
I WASN'T WORRIED

07:06.667 --> 07:09.567
BECAUSE I HAVE
UNLIMITED MILEAGE
ON MY RENTAL CAR.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.267
I WOULDN'T CARE
HOW LONG IT WAS.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.433
( male )
THAT'S GOOD.

07:12.467 --> 07:15.767
WE WERE SURPRISED THE FREEWAY
WAS VIRTUALLY EMPTY.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.567
YOU CAN REALLY GET STUCK
IN TRAFFIC FOR HOURS.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.800
YEAH.

07:19.833 --> 07:22.733
SOMETIMES IT GETS SO BAD
YOU CAN HARDLY BREATHE.

07:24.467 --> 07:26.933
I'M GLAD
I DON'T LIVE HERE.

07:26.967 --> 07:29.100
DO YOU THINK BECKY'S
COMING DOWN PRETTY SOON ?

07:29.133 --> 07:30.733
OH, I THINK SO.

07:30.767 --> 07:33.467
SHE'S BEEN ON THE PHONE
ALL MORNING WITH HER, UH,

07:33.500 --> 07:35.867
BOYFRIEND, WELL,
NOW HER EX-BOYFRIEND.

07:35.900 --> 07:39.467
HE BROKE UP WITH HER
LAST NIGHT AND...

07:39.500 --> 07:41.967
ISN'T THAT AWFUL ?

07:42.067 --> 07:46.600
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF TIMING--
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.867
( female )
LOUSY.

07:51.233 --> 07:53.633
SO I THINK I'M GONNA
GO OUT FOR AWHILE.

07:53.667 --> 07:54.633
IS THAT OKAY ?

07:54.667 --> 07:56.067
WHERE ARE
YOU GOING ?

07:56.100 --> 07:58.067
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
PLAYING SOME GOLF.

07:58.067 --> 08:00.533
ARE YOU JOKING ?

08:00.567 --> 08:02.700
WELL, I'M NOT CONTRIBUTING
ANYTHING HERE.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.067
YES, YOU ARE.
I'M DETRACTING.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.567
I'M A MINUS HERE,
I'M NOT A PLUS.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.067
IF YOUR AUNT DIED,

08:07.067 --> 08:09.667
I WOULD BE RIGHT BY YOUR SIDE
TO SUPPORT YOU.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.133
HEY, IF MY AUNT
KILLED HERSELF,

08:11.167 --> 08:12.933
I WOULD BE ENCOURAGING YOU
TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.

08:12.967 --> 08:14.133
I'D SAY GO,
GO HAVE SOME FUN.

08:14.167 --> 08:16.400
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
STAY HERE AND MOURN.

08:16.433 --> 08:17.900
I WOULD KEEP YOU
AROUND TO MOURN ?

08:17.933 --> 08:19.733
YOU'RE NOT
GOING GOLFING.

08:22.167 --> 08:23.867
WELL, I KNOW WE'RE ALL
GOING TO MISS LOUISE.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.700
OH, YEAH.

08:25.733 --> 08:27.067
VERY MUCH SO.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.100
MM-HMM.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.800
BUT WE HAVE
TO CONTINUE.

08:29.833 --> 08:31.567
WE MUST GO ON.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.367
( Larry )
WE MUST GO ON.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.633
CAN'T GO ON.

08:36.667 --> 08:39.133
MUST GO ON.

08:41.900 --> 08:45.067
WELL, YOU KNOW,
LAUGHTER IS A GREAT HEALER

08:45.067 --> 08:47.267
AND YOU'VE GOTTA
HAVE A SMILE.

08:47.300 --> 08:51.367
YOU KNOW, YOU GET OVER
A LOT OF THINGS THAT WAY.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.867
YEAH, I ONCE PERFORMED
FOR NORMAN COUSINS

08:53.900 --> 08:56.267
IN HIS HOSPITAL ROOM
WHEN HE WAS ON HIS DEATHBED.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.200
HE REQUESTED ME
TO DO FIVE MINUTES.

08:58.233 --> 09:01.900
AND, UH, I BOMBED,
ACTUALLY,

09:01.933 --> 09:03.267
AND HE GOT
MUCH WORSE

09:03.300 --> 09:05.733
AND HE HAD TO WATCH
SOME MARX BROTHERS MOVIES

09:05.767 --> 09:07.600
TO ACTUALLY
RESUSCITATE HIM, BUT...

09:07.633 --> 09:10.700
YOU KNOW WHO'S FUNNY ?
THAT CARROT TOP.

09:10.733 --> 09:12.333
HAVE YOU SEEN
THAT GUY ?

09:12.367 --> 09:14.733
HE COMES ON THE TONIGHT SHOW
ONCE IN AWHILE.

09:14.767 --> 09:16.967
BIG MOP
OF RED HAIR.

09:17.067 --> 09:18.700
OH, MY GOSH !

09:18.733 --> 09:21.933
THE OBITUARY !
DO WE HAVE THE PAPER ?

09:21.967 --> 09:23.733
OH, YEAH, WE WANT
TO LOOK AT THAT.

09:23.767 --> 09:25.067
OKAY.

09:25.067 --> 09:26.733
I'LL GO
GET THE PAPER.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.667
NO, DON'T YOU BOTHER,
I'VE GOT THE CAR.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.933
YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHERE IT IS.

09:30.967 --> 09:33.433
I HAVE UNLIMITED MILEAGE,
I CAN DRIVE ANYWHERE.

09:33.467 --> 09:34.733
NO, HE KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING.

09:34.767 --> 09:36.600
IT'S RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER,
HE'LL FIND IT.

09:36.633 --> 09:38.333
I'M SURE
HE WILL.

09:38.367 --> 09:40.733
GIVES HIM PLEASURE
TO USE THE RENTAL CAR.

09:40.767 --> 09:42.200
MM-HMM.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.100
YOU COULD MOVE OVER
A LITTLE BIT NOW

09:44.133 --> 09:45.933
BECAUSE HE'S NOT
SITTING THERE ANYMORE.

09:45.967 --> 09:47.067
GET A LITTLE
MORE ROOM HERE.

09:47.067 --> 09:49.467
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

09:53.567 --> 09:54.533
THESE ARE
PRETTY GOOD.

09:54.567 --> 09:55.967
YEAH.

09:56.067 --> 09:58.367
HOW MANY DO YOU THINK I CAN
GET IN MY MOUTH AT ONE TIME ?

09:58.400 --> 09:59.433
SIX.

09:59.467 --> 10:00.467
YOU SAY SIX ?

10:00.500 --> 10:01.500
( female )
FIVE.

10:01.533 --> 10:04.067
THREE, FOUR.

10:08.667 --> 10:12.100
( as Brando )
LOOK WHAT THEY DID
TO MY SANTINO.

10:13.133 --> 10:14.933
GLADYS, GEORGE...

10:14.967 --> 10:16.000
LOOK WHAT THEY DID.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.067
OH, SUGAR.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.800
OH, NO,
BECKY.

10:18.833 --> 10:20.233
OH, NO.

10:20.267 --> 10:21.933
OH, MY GOSH.

10:22.967 --> 10:25.667
OH, WHAT DID HE SAY ?
WHAT HAPPENED ?

10:25.700 --> 10:29.133
HE JUST KEPT REPEATING SOMETHING
ABOUT NOT BEING HAPPY.

10:29.167 --> 10:30.967
WE COULD'VE
WORKED THROUGH THAT.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
THE NERVE
OF THIS GUY !

10:32.033 --> 10:33.067
JERK.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.833
WHAT KIND OF
TIMING IS THIS ?

10:34.867 --> 10:36.300
I JUST BURIED
MY AUNT !

10:36.333 --> 10:37.300
I KNOW.

10:37.333 --> 10:39.233
AND HE BREAKS UP
WITH ME ?

10:39.267 --> 10:41.900
YOU DON'T DO THAT
TO SOMEBODY, NO.

10:41.933 --> 10:44.267
THAT'S SO AWFUL.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.933
I MEAN,
HE REALLY LOVED ME.

10:47.967 --> 10:49.700
YEAH.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.800
DID HE SAY
ANYTHING TO YOU ?

10:51.833 --> 10:54.467
I KNOW HOW MUCH HE LIKES YOU,
I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE--

10:54.500 --> 10:57.033
NO, WE JUST, UH,
YOU KNOW,

10:57.067 --> 11:00.733

AND, THE MINI BAR.

11:00.767 --> 11:03.167
THE MINI BAR ?

11:04.467 --> 11:06.633
OH, GOSH,
OH, GOSH.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.600
THIS IS
RIDICULOUS.

11:08.633 --> 11:10.200
WHERE ARE
YOU GOING ?

11:10.233 --> 11:12.833

12:25.967 --> 12:28.167
GET SOME WRAPPING PAPER

12:28.200 --> 12:30.467
OKAY, WHERE WOULD I
GET THE PAPER ?

12:30.500 --> 12:32.267
YOU KNOW, THERE'S

12:36.867 --> 12:38.633

12:46.567 --> 12:48.633
NO, I DON'T
BELIEVE THEY DO.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.833
YOU COULD CHECK.

12:50.867 --> 12:52.433
AND YOU MIGHT
WANT TO--

12:52.467 --> 12:55.067
IF YOU'RE GONNA
GO GET THAT STUFF,
YOU MIGHT WANNA GET A BOW.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.233
AND A CARD.

12:56.267 --> 12:59.367
A BOW AND A CARD ?

14:01.967 --> 14:03.533
DID JEFF LOOK AT THIS

14:03.567 --> 14:05.067
NO, THEY HAVE PROOFREADERS
AT THESE PAPERS !

14:05.067 --> 14:07.400

14:07.433 --> 14:08.900
"BELOVED CUNT" ?!

14:08.933 --> 14:10.067

"IT WASN'T HER MOTHER WHO DIED,
IT WAS JUST HER AUNT.

14:45.967 --> 14:47.567
"YOU SHOULD BREAK UP
WITH HER TODAY.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.833
YOU DON'T LOOK HAPPY,

14:49.867 --> 14:51.233

14:51.267 --> 14:52.600
YEAH, THAT'S

14:52.633 --> 14:55.533
OH, MY GOD, DID YOU TELL CRAIG
TO BREAK UP WITH BECKY ?

14:55.567 --> 14:57.100
HE TALKED TO ME
AT THE FUNERAL,

14:57.133 --> 14:59.300
BUT I TOLD HIM TO WAIT 'TIL
HE GOT BACK TO TALLAHASSEE !

14:59.333 --> 15:01.400
I DIDN'T SAY TO DO IT
LAST NIGHT AT THE WAKE !

15:01.433 --> 15:02.867
OH, WELL,
NEVER MIND !

15:02.900 --> 15:04.833
WHAT IS
THE MATTER WITH YOU ?!

15:04.867 --> 15:07.267
HE'S A BAD GUY,
I WAS DOING YOU A FAVOR !

15:07.300 --> 15:09.700
OKAY, LARRY, I THINK
YOU SHOULD JUST LEAVE !

15:58.467 --> 15:59.533
DO YOU HAVE
THE PAPER ?

15:59.567 --> 16:01.200
NO, I DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING.

16:01.233 --> 16:03.867
YOU COULD PROBABLY GO TO
A STATIONARY STORE.

16:03.900 --> 16:05.933
YEAH, STATIONARY STORE
FOR THE SCISSOR AND THE TAPE,

16:05.967 --> 16:08.067

16:08.067 --> 16:09.767
YEAH, DEPENDING ON
WHAT KIND OF PAPER YOU WANT.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.433

16:17.233 --> 16:19.333

16:19.367 --> 16:20.433
I DON'T KNOW,

16:20.467 --> 16:23.667
I WOULDN'T BET ON IT,
I WOULD BRING MY OWN.

16:23.700 --> 16:24.800
WELL, LET ME

16:24.833 --> 16:27.400
IF I BROUGHT

16:27.433 --> 16:29.633
TO THIS PARTY STORE

16:29.667 --> 16:30.667
RIGHT, THEY HAVE
THE PAPER THERE.

16:30.700 --> 16:32.233
WOULD THEY
WRAP IT FOR ME ?

16:32.267 --> 16:34.267
THEY MIGHT,
HONESTY, I DON'T KNOW

16:34.300 --> 16:35.900
BECAUSE MY WIFE
WRAPS EVERYTHING.

16:35.933 --> 16:38.700
BUT IF YOU BRING IT WITH YOU,
IF YOU HAVE IT THERE,

16:38.733 --> 16:40.067
MAYBE THEY--
I DON'T KNOW,

16:42.933 --> 16:44.767

16:44.800 --> 16:47.500
HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT

16:49.500 --> 16:50.733

16:50.767 --> 16:52.200
THAT'S FOR
THE PAPER, RIGHT ?

16:52.233 --> 16:53.500
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE
THE SCISSORS AND THE TAPE.

16:53.533 --> 16:54.500
YEAH, THEY WILL.

17:20.633 --> 17:23.433
SO, MOM, I THOUGHT MAYBE
TOMORROW IF YOU'RE UP TO IT,

17:23.467 --> 17:25.067

WHAT KIND OF PRESENT IS THAT ?
NOT WRAPPED NICELY.

17:43.067 --> 17:45.967
YEAH,
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

17:46.067 --> 17:48.700
I LOOKED IN STORES,
I COULDN'T FIND
ANY WRAPPING STORE.

17:48.733 --> 17:51.100
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO
WRAPPING STORES ANYWHERE ?

17:51.133 --> 17:53.600
OH, MY GOSH !

18:05.300 --> 18:06.300
YOU HEAR THAT ?

18:06.333 --> 18:07.967
I CAN'T USE 'EM.

18:08.067 --> 18:10.567
I, I HAVE A PRESCRIPTION
IN MY LENSES.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.233
I'M SORRY.

18:17.467 --> 18:18.933
I'LL GET
LENSES PUT IN.

YOU'LL GIVE ME
YOUR PRESCRIPTION

18:20.133 --> 18:21.633
AND WE'LL MAKE THEM
PRESCRIPTION GLASSES.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.600
( Jeff )
ISN'T THAT NICE ?

18:23.633 --> 18:25.400
OH, HOW DID
THE OBIT GO ?

18:25.433 --> 18:27.067
YOU GOT A PAPER ?

18:27.067 --> 18:28.467

18:28.500 --> 18:30.100
OBITUARIES...

18:30.133 --> 18:31.667
IT'S IN
THE BACK THERE.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.800
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW IT WENT.

18:33.833 --> 18:35.467
HERE,
HERE'S HOW IT WENT.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.633
"LOUISE HOENIN,
DEVOTED SISTER, BELOVED CUNT" ?

18:38.667 --> 18:39.700
( wife )
WHAT ?!

18:39.733 --> 18:41.200
JEFFREY, IT SAYS THAT

18:41.233 --> 18:42.233
LET ME SEE THIS.

18:42.267 --> 18:43.267
THAT'S
UNBELIEVABLE !

18:43.300 --> 18:44.333
I KNOW !

18:44.367 --> 18:45.433
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE !

18:45.467 --> 18:47.933
YOU SAID AUNT,
I WROTE DOWN AUNT !

18:47.967 --> 18:49.067
THAT'S BULLSHIT !

18:49.067 --> 18:50.433
DON'T THEY
PROOFREAD THESE THINGS ?

18:50.467 --> 18:51.733
I AM
SO SORRY.

18:51.767 --> 18:53.300
OH, GOD,
LARRY.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.567
YEAH, I NEED A LETTER OF APOLOGY
FROM YOUR FRIEND--

18:55.600 --> 18:56.633
RETRACTION,
RETRACTION.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.067
WHAT ARE THEY
GONNA SAY ?

18:58.100 --> 19:01.667
"WE'RE SORRY
WE CALLED HER A CUNT,
WE MEANT AUNT" ?

19:01.700 --> 19:03.700
POINT WELL TAKEN,
I'LL HAVE THEM WRITE
A LETTER OF APOLOGY.

19:03.733 --> 19:04.767
AND YOU, TOO.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.067
I'LL WRITE ONE, TOO,
I PROMISE.

19:06.067 --> 19:07.400
YEAH, STILL,
TO PRINT THIS.

19:07.433 --> 19:08.933
CHERYL MUST BE
SO UPSET.

19:08.967 --> 19:10.967
SHE KICKED ME
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.067
SHE KICKED YOU OUT ?

19:12.100 --> 19:14.767
HER RELATIVES ARE THERE,
HER PARENTS, FRIENDS,

19:14.800 --> 19:16.367
THEY CAME AFTER ME
LIKE A PACK OF--

19:16.400 --> 19:17.667
I THOUGHT THEY WERE
GONNA KILL ME.

19:17.700 --> 19:18.833
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
YOU'LL STAY HERE.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.633
I CAN'T STAY HERE,
I HAVE NOTHING TO WEAR.

19:20.667 --> 19:22.300
I'VE GOT PLENTY OF STUFF
FOR YOU TO WEAR !

19:22.333 --> 19:24.400
NO, LARRY,
YOU'LL STAY HERE.

19:24.433 --> 19:25.800
YOU KNOW, MOM AND DAD
ARE HERE ANYWAY.

19:25.833 --> 19:27.867
IT'S NO BIG DEAL,
I'M MAKING A GREAT DINNER.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.633
YOU'LL STAY HERE TONIGHT,
I'M SO SORRY.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.600
I THINK YOU SHOULD CALL CHERYL
AND PERSONALLY APOLOGIZE.

19:31.633 --> 19:32.667
I WILL,
I WILL.

19:32.700 --> 19:33.867
DO ME A FAVOR.

19:33.900 --> 19:37.133
WHEN I DIE, LET SOMEONE ELSE
HANDLE THE OBIT, OKAY ?

19:37.167 --> 19:38.533
HEY, HOW MUCH LONGER

FINISH THE MOVIE, COME ON.

19:42.933 --> 19:43.967
WHAT MOVIE ?

19:44.067 --> 19:47.067
LARRY, LET ME SEE
THOSE GLASSES AGAIN.

19:47.067 --> 19:48.533
THOSE SUNGLASSES.

19:48.567 --> 19:50.167
OKAY, SURE.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.633
I CAN'T SEE THROUGH THEM,
BUT I CAN GET AN IDEA.

19:52.667 --> 19:53.667
THEY'RE BEAUTIES.

19:53.700 --> 19:55.600
I'M TELLING YOU,
ELIZABETH TAYLOR.

19:55.633 --> 19:56.700
OH, WAIT,

19:56.733 --> 19:59.233
I THINK I CAN
SEE MY REFLECTION IN HERE.

19:59.267 --> 20:02.267
OH, WAIT, HOLD IT,

20:22.033 --> 20:23.667
WE'LL GET THAT
TAKEN CARE OF.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.833
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE
TOO LONG, YOU KNOW ?

20:25.867 --> 20:27.767
THEY LOOK GOOD,

20:27.800 --> 20:32.600
SEE, MOM, I TOLD YOU HE'S GOT
A VERY, VERY SWEET SIDE.

20:32.633 --> 20:34.233

20:51.733 --> 20:53.067

20:54.633 --> 20:55.833

20:55.867 --> 20:56.867
YOU GOTTA GO.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.067
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?

20:58.100 --> 21:00.700
YOU COPPED A FEEL OFF MY MOM,
YOU GOTTA GO.

21:00.733 --> 21:04.267
I COPPED A FEEL OFF YOUR MOM,
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO ME ?!

21:04.300 --> 21:05.433
SHE'S WALKING AROUND,
MOPING AROUND,

21:05.467 --> 21:06.467
I'M SAYING,
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?

21:06.500 --> 21:07.867
SHE SAID,
"LARRY TOUCHED MY BOSOM

21:07.900 --> 21:09.300
AND HELD IT THERE
FOR SEVERAL SECONDS."

21:09.333 --> 21:11.700
SCHMUCK !
WOULD YOU LISTEN TO ME
FOR A SECOND ?

21:11.733 --> 21:12.733
WHAT ?

21:14.400 --> 21:15.900
WE'RE IN THE KITCHEN.

21:15.933 --> 21:17.767
SHE WANTED TO TRY ON
THE SUNGLASSES AGAIN, OKAY ?

21:17.800 --> 21:19.633
AND SHE WAS LOOKING
IN THE TOASTER

21:19.667 --> 21:22.067
AND I PICKED UP THE TOASTER
AND I WAS HOLDING THE TOASTER,

21:22.100 --> 21:24.600
AND SHE WANTED TO GET
A BETTER LOOK AT HER FACE
IN THE TOASTER

21:24.633 --> 21:27.233
AND SHE LEANED AGAINST
THE BACK OF MY HAND,

21:27.267 --> 21:28.767
AND SO, I DIDN'T
WANT TO JUST TURN--

21:28.800 --> 21:32.933
I DIDN'T WANT TO
HURT HER FEELINGS
BY JUST TAKING IT AWAY FAST.

21:32.967 --> 21:34.700
I'M SORRY.

21:34.733 --> 21:36.667
SHE'S ALL FREAKED OUT.

21:36.700 --> 21:38.733
YOU GOTTA GO.

21:38.767 --> 21:41.233
YOU'RE KICKING ME OUT ?
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING ?

21:41.267 --> 21:44.333
ALRIGHT, LOOK, LOOK,
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK...

21:44.367 --> 21:46.567
SET THE ALARM, DO YOU KNOW
HOW TO SET THE ALARM ?

21:46.600 --> 21:48.133
SEVEN A.M.

21:48.167 --> 21:50.167
SHE RUBBED UP AGAINST
THE BACK OF MY HAND !

21:50.200 --> 21:51.900
I BELIEVE YOU,
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT !

21:51.933 --> 21:53.067
YOU THINK I GO AROUND
FEELING UP OLD LADIES ?!

21:53.100 --> 21:55.067
I APOLOGIZED,
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT !

21:55.100 --> 21:57.400
SHH, IT'S NOT
ABOUT THAT.

21:57.433 --> 21:58.700
BUT LISTEN TO ME.

21:58.733 --> 21:59.867
YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE
AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING.

21:59.900 --> 22:01.700
ALRIGHT, I'LL BE OUT OF HERE

22:01.733 --> 22:04.233
THERE'S BAGELS IN THE KITCHEN,
GRAB ONE AND GET OUT.

22:04.267 --> 22:06.167
I WON'T GRAB ANYTHING,
I'LL JUST WALK OUT THE DOOR.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.067
YOUR MOTHER THINKS
I TOUCHED HER BREAST ?

22:08.067 --> 22:09.567
THAT IS SO SICK.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.600
IT'S WHAT SHE THINKS,
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY ?

22:11.633 --> 22:12.667
SWEET DREAMS.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.733
SWEET DREAMS.

22:15.767 --> 22:18.100
I'LL DREAM ABOUT
FUCKING YOUR MOTHER,
SWEET DREAMS.

22:41.067 --> 22:42.100
YOU !

22:42.133 --> 22:43.100
SHH, QUIET.

22:43.133 --> 22:44.133
HOW DARE YOU.

22:44.167 --> 22:45.167
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.367
LET ME EXPLAIN
WHAT HAPPENED.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.967
WHAT, YOU THINK I ENJOY
THAT KIND OF THING ?

22:48.067 --> 22:50.700
NO, OF COURSE NOT,
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS,
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

22:50.733 --> 22:52.733
( Jeff )
THIS HAS GOTTA STOP.

22:52.767 --> 22:54.800
WILL YOU PLEASE TELL HER
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ?

22:54.833 --> 22:57.067
MA, MA,
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

22:57.067 --> 22:59.833
IT WAS THE TOASTER
AND THE HAND.

22:59.867 --> 23:01.733
YOU RUBBED
AGAINST ME.

23:01.767 --> 23:03.267
SHH, YOU'RE GONNA
WAKE UP SAMMY.

23:03.300 --> 23:04.300
SHH !

23:04.333 --> 23:07.167
DID YOU SEE
WHAT HE DID ?

23:07.200 --> 23:08.633
I EXPLAINED TO HER
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

23:08.667 --> 23:09.667
IT WAS
AN ACCIDENT.

23:09.700 --> 23:10.833
OH, HOW CONVENIENT.

23:10.867 --> 23:13.700
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
YOU RUBBED UP AGAINST ME.

23:15.767 --> 23:19.700
WHAT KIND OF
HUMAN BEING ARE YOU ?

23:19.733 --> 23:22.167
YES, YOU PUSHED UP
AGAINST MY HAND !

23:22.200 --> 23:24.300
I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING !

23:24.333 --> 23:25.800
IT WAS
AN ACCIDENT.

23:25.833 --> 23:27.133
YOU GOTTA GO,
YOU HAVE TO GO.

23:27.167 --> 23:28.300
I THINK
IT'S BETTER, LARRY.

23:28.333 --> 23:29.767
OKAY, MA ?
HE'S GONNA LEAVE.

23:29.800 --> 23:30.800
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

23:30.833 --> 23:32.200
SICK PERSON.

23:32.233 --> 23:34.400
( Jeff )
ENOUGH OF THE "SICK PERSON",
HE'S NOT A SICK PERSON.

23:42.533 --> 23:43.467
HEY.

23:45.267 --> 23:47.600
I'M REALLY SORRY.

23:47.633 --> 23:50.833
THIS IS HORRIBLE,
I'M SO SORRY.

23:50.867 --> 23:52.067
PLEASE
ACCEPT MY APOLOGY.

23:52.067 --> 23:53.767
WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT YOU.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.233
I'LL STRAIGHTEN
IT OUT TOMORROW.

23:55.267 --> 23:58.067
YOU KNOW, THEY GET
A LITTLE CRAZY, MY PARENTS.

23:58.067 --> 23:59.067
I'M SORRY.

23:59.067 --> 24:00.633
IT'S AN AWFUL THING.

24:00.667 --> 24:02.333
I MEAN, EVEN
WHEN I WAS DATING,

24:02.367 --> 24:04.067
I WOULD WAIT
FOUR MONTHS

24:04.067 --> 24:07.167
BEFORE I WOULD TRY
AND MAKE A BREAST MOVE,
YOU KNOW ?

24:07.200 --> 24:08.200
I UNDERSTAND.

24:08.233 --> 24:09.633
AND IT WOULDN'T BE
IN THEIR KITCHEN

24:09.667 --> 24:12.300
IN FRONT OF THEIR
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
AND THEIR SON--

24:12.333 --> 24:13.533
I KNOW,
IT'S HORRIBLE.

24:13.567 --> 24:16.067
I'LL TAKE OF IT ALL TOMORROW,
I'LL SMOOTH IT ALL OVER.

24:16.067 --> 24:17.467
DO ME A FAVOR.

24:17.500 --> 24:19.300
LET ME TAKE CARE
OF THE SUNGLASSES.

24:19.333 --> 24:20.433
THE SUNGLASSES ?

24:20.467 --> 24:22.500
YEAH, GIVE THEM TO ME,
LET ME TAKE CARE OF THEM.

24:22.533 --> 24:24.233
YOU WANT ME TO
GIVE HER A GIFT NOW ?

24:24.267 --> 24:25.233
YOU GAVE IT TO HER.

24:25.267 --> 24:26.600
AFTER THIS
ENTERTAINING EVENING ?

24:26.633 --> 24:27.667
YOU GAVE IT TO HER.

24:27.700 --> 24:28.700
NO, I DON'T
THINK SO.

24:28.733 --> 24:30.367
NO, NO, NO, NO.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.433
THAT'S CALLED
"INDIAN GIVING".

24:32.467 --> 24:33.733
YES, I KNOW
WHAT IT'S CALLED.

24:33.767 --> 24:36.233
IT'S A VERY RACIST TERM,
BUT I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

24:36.267 --> 24:37.333
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO WITH THEM ?

24:37.367 --> 24:39.267
WHAT COULD YOU
POSSIBLY DO WITH THEM ?

24:39.300 --> 24:42.633
I'LL GIVE THEM TO
SOMEBODY WHO LIKES ME.

24:42.667 --> 24:44.067
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING NOW ?

24:44.067 --> 24:46.100
I DON'T KNOW,
I CAN'T GO HOME.

24:46.133 --> 24:48.600
GUESS I'LL GO
TO A HOTEL.

24:57.067 --> 24:59.767

WAKE HIM UP,
GET HIM OUT,
THAT'S MY ROOM.

25:24.367 --> 25:28.433
OKAY, UM, THIS ROOM IS
