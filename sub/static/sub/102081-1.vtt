- Yeah.

02:44.900 --> 02:45.950
Well, he seems pretty happy.

I think he's just kind of
missing me a little bit,

after him, I appreciate it.

(Newscaster's voice echos)

16:05.490 --> 16:09.347
I'm scared of others and
I'm scared of myself.

16:14.146 --> 16:16.896
(waves crashing)

16:19.855 --> 16:21.003
(guest knocking)

16:21.003 --> 16:24.753
(tentative, expectant music)

16:49.037 --> 16:51.370
(tape pops)

16:59.695 --> 17:02.528
(paper crinkling)

17:11.117 --> 17:12.034
Microphone?

17:14.040 --> 17:16.637
(contents rattles)

17:16.637 --> 17:20.676
(chuckles) Good vibes.

17:20.676 --> 17:22.509
Candles, how romantic.

17:26.245 --> 17:27.828
Finally, some info.

17:31.545 --> 17:33.200
(eerie, ringing music)
- Express Couriers.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.570
- Hi.

17:34.570 --> 17:39.190
Hi, yeah, I actually, I
recently received a shipment

17:39.190 --> 17:41.520
from your company.
- A shipment?

17:41.520 --> 17:43.210
- A few of them, actually.

17:43.210 --> 17:44.720
No?

17:44.720 --> 17:45.553
I mean, okay.

17:45.553 --> 17:47.480
I didn't really actually
order anything from you.

17:47.480 --> 17:48.313
- [Company Rep] How can I help you, miss?

17:48.313 --> 17:50.490
- I was wondering if you could
tell me where they came from,

17:50.490 --> 17:52.990
but these mystery boxes just keep arriving

17:52.990 --> 17:55.150
with sort of random things in them and--

17:55.150 --> 17:56.100
- [Company Rep] Order access number?

17:56.100 --> 17:57.300
- Yeah, well that's the thing.

17:57.300 --> 18:00.770
There's not really an order
number or any information.

18:00.770 --> 18:02.792
- It's your fault, miss.
- (stammers) Hello?

18:02.792 --> 18:06.209
(eerie, expectant music)

18:07.471 --> 18:10.304
(paper crinkling)

18:23.072 --> 18:25.739
(phone ringing)

18:26.950 --> 18:28.030
Nate.

18:28.030 --> 18:30.530
Hey, buddy, (chuckles) what's up?

18:30.530 --> 18:32.024
- Hey hey, Ru-bay.

18:32.024 --> 18:33.530
(Ruby chuckles)

18:33.530 --> 18:35.230
You seem peppy, what you up to?

18:35.230 --> 18:37.440
- Oh you know, just doing some work.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.410
I came across some photos
that made me smile.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.470
Hey, do you remember that day we went up

18:42.470 --> 18:44.370
to the old water tower and I roped you

18:44.370 --> 18:45.570
into being my assistant?

18:47.300 --> 18:49.760
You carried all my gear
all the way up that hill.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.520
- Yeah, the water tower.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.890
Aw man, it just happened to be,

18:52.890 --> 18:54.810
I think, the hottest day in a decade.

18:54.810 --> 18:56.010
And there we were.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.810
- Yeah, that feels like so long ago.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.190
Anyway, what's up with you?

19:01.190 --> 19:02.410
- You know, I've been busier than ever

19:02.410 --> 19:04.230
with this whole virus thing.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.400
Aw man, I just wanted to
give you a heads up though.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.730
I think local officials are gonna

19:07.730 --> 19:09.950
start locking things down a bit.

19:09.950 --> 19:11.530
- Really, that seems
like a bit over the top.

19:11.530 --> 19:12.450
Don't you think?

19:12.450 --> 19:14.060
- Well the thing is, there's
not really adequate testing

19:14.060 --> 19:15.950
for this sort of thing so theoretically,

19:15.950 --> 19:17.643
we don't really have a way of tracking it.

19:17.643 --> 19:20.110
And you know, until people
start showing symptoms

19:20.110 --> 19:23.100
and by then, it's too
late and well government,

19:23.100 --> 19:25.120
they're not really giving us
the facts that they should.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.350
- Okay, so what does this all mean?

19:27.350 --> 19:29.230
- Hey look, all I'm saying
is lay low for a bit,

19:29.230 --> 19:32.510
and don't be surprised if
things start to seem a bit off.

19:32.510 --> 19:36.700
We don't really have
all the facts and well,

19:36.700 --> 19:37.871
a lot of people are gonna get sick.

19:37.871 --> 19:40.140
(chuckles) A lot of
people already are sick.

19:40.140 --> 19:41.590
- Nate, you're kind of freaking me out.

19:41.590 --> 19:42.970
- Hey, I got your back.

19:42.970 --> 19:45.500
Just keep safe and I'll be in touch.

19:45.500 --> 19:46.390
Oh, and wash your hands.

19:46.390 --> 19:47.440
Like a lot, dude.

19:47.440 --> 19:48.785
Seriously, like a lot, okay?

19:48.785 --> 19:50.436
- 'Kay.

19:50.436 --> 19:53.853
(slow, thoughtful music)

19:56.916 --> 19:59.017
(water splashing)

19:59.017 --> 20:03.023
Virus. (sighs)

20:03.023 --> 20:06.440
(eerie, expectant music)

20:31.863 --> 20:34.613
(doorbell rings)

20:47.370 --> 20:50.430
- Hey, there she is!
- (chuckles) Dad, hi.

20:50.430 --> 20:53.440
- Hi, I was in the area and
I thought I might stop by

20:53.440 --> 20:54.941
and bring you some coffee.

20:54.941 --> 20:55.774
- Thanks.

20:56.760 --> 21:00.260
- I tried calling you a few
times, but I got no answer.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.093
- Yeah, sorry about that.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.630
I was sleeping pretty hard, I guess.

21:02.630 --> 21:03.463
- Oh.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.296
- But come on in.

21:09.010 --> 21:10.710
- Still smoking those things, huh?

21:11.920 --> 21:14.850
I've been nicotine free
for almost a year now.

21:14.850 --> 21:16.710
Feels great.

21:16.710 --> 21:17.660
- That's good, Dad.

21:19.443 --> 21:21.440
- You know, there are resources to help.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.523
- Look, you know I hardly smoke, okay?

21:23.523 --> 21:27.312
I've just been under
stress and bored, honestly.

21:27.312 --> 21:28.303
- I hear ya.

21:29.690 --> 21:32.770
Well, it's my fault for smoking
around you all those years.

21:32.770 --> 21:34.033
- It's my choice.

21:38.277 --> 21:40.470
Okay listen, I'll stop soon.

21:40.470 --> 21:42.913
This is my last pack, I
won't buy another one.

21:44.040 --> 21:45.430
Cool?

21:45.430 --> 21:47.680
What are you doing out here anyways?

21:47.680 --> 21:50.770
- Well, I'm onto (stammers) a new job

21:50.770 --> 21:53.220
and I was just passing through.

21:53.220 --> 21:55.210
I know we had plans to go to dinner soon,

21:55.210 --> 21:58.063
but I'm gonna be out of town for a while.

22:00.130 --> 22:01.093
- What kind of job?

22:03.890 --> 22:04.723
Dad?

22:04.723 --> 22:05.963
- Don't worry, it's legit.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.440
A friend of mine owns
some property out of town

22:10.440 --> 22:12.500
and he needs some help for a few weeks.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.580
Besides, I didn't wanna miss by chance

22:14.580 --> 22:18.033
to see you since we both have
crazy scheduling, these days.

22:19.250 --> 22:20.803
- Well, it's always good to see you.

22:21.970 --> 22:25.610
Hey, Nate had said something
to me about this virus

22:25.610 --> 22:28.890
that's going around and I guess
it can get pretty sketchy.

22:28.890 --> 22:30.710
Respiratory illness, so just be careful,

22:30.710 --> 22:31.810
okay?
- Nate!

22:31.810 --> 22:33.300
Oh, how's he doing?

22:33.300 --> 22:35.540
You guys were always such a good team.

22:35.540 --> 22:36.420
- Nate's good, Dad.

22:36.420 --> 22:37.500
Just take care of yourself, all right?

22:37.500 --> 22:40.150
Wash your hands and watch out.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.600
- Sweetie.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.623
No silly virus is gonna
take down your old dad.

22:45.849 --> 22:46.682
- Okay.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.320
- Well, it was nice seeing you, kiddo.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.213
- Yeah, you too, thanks for stopping by.

22:55.070 --> 22:57.033
- Oh, you got a package.

22:58.320 --> 23:01.440
- Another one? (sighs exasperatedly)

23:01.440 --> 23:02.900
- You're ordering stuff online

23:02.900 --> 23:05.329
after puffing those greens, huh?

23:05.329 --> 23:06.323
- (laughs) Dad.

23:07.510 --> 23:09.160
Love you, thanks for stopping by.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.927
Take care of yourself, okay?

23:10.927 --> 23:12.110
(door creaks)
- I'll do that.

23:20.461 --> 23:21.489
(simple, bouncy music)

23:21.489 --> 23:24.274
- (chuckles) Wow. (slaps)

23:24.274 --> 23:27.635
Whoever is sending this
is into some freaky shit.

23:27.635 --> 23:30.246
(chuckles)

23:30.246 --> 23:31.079
What?

23:33.070 --> 23:33.920
Gotta be kidding.

23:35.337 --> 23:38.380
(phone ringing)

23:38.380 --> 23:40.090
Hi. (laughs)

23:40.090 --> 23:43.900
- I knew you was into that
dominatrix shit. (laughs)

23:43.900 --> 23:45.720
- Come on, it's not a bad look, now is it?

23:45.720 --> 23:48.360
- Seriously though,
what's up with the trash?

23:48.360 --> 23:49.980
- Honestly, I wish I knew.

23:49.980 --> 23:51.680
These packages just showing up.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.370
I think they're for someone else.

23:53.370 --> 23:54.840
- Winning for you.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.002
- Yeah anyways, what are you up to?

23:57.002 --> 23:59.550
- (sighs) I'm not gonna lie, I panicked.

23:59.550 --> 24:01.000
I bought a whole bunch of supplies

24:01.000 --> 24:03.150
'cause I heard we about
to be on lock pretty soon.

24:03.150 --> 24:05.880
- Wait, supplies, like what?

24:05.880 --> 24:09.250
- You know, water, canned
goods, toilet paper.

24:09.250 --> 24:10.620
- Okay, you know that this is

24:10.620 --> 24:12.230
not a nuclear holocaust, right?

24:12.230 --> 24:14.220
It's a respiratory infection.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.470
Besides, I talked to Nate and
he said just wash your hands,

24:16.470 --> 24:18.550
a bunch, and lay low.

24:18.550 --> 24:19.570
- Really?

24:19.570 --> 24:20.403
- Yeah.

24:20.403 --> 24:22.130
In fact, I'm gonna do a
deep clean on my house.

24:22.130 --> 24:24.960
I know it's, (clears
throat) it's past due.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.760
- Oo, good idea, we should
have a cleaning party.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.810
- Let's stream it later,
we can have music, drinks.

24:29.810 --> 24:30.940
Make it fun.

24:30.940 --> 24:32.230
- Oh my gosh, that
sounds like so much fun.

24:32.230 --> 24:34.173
I'm down, I'll talk to you soon, okay?

24:34.173 --> 24:37.256
(upbeat party music)

24:38.400 --> 24:39.450
All right, you ready?

24:40.310 --> 24:41.143
- [Both] Cheers.

24:44.060 --> 24:45.330
- Let's do this.

24:45.330 --> 24:46.230
- Oo, that's good.

24:49.344 --> 24:50.740
(sighs)

24:50.740 --> 24:52.973
Girl, I'm sweating over here.

24:52.973 --> 24:55.473
(Ruby laughs)

24:56.360 --> 24:57.653
You are too much.

24:59.710 --> 25:01.530
- You're telling me.

25:01.530 --> 25:03.630
It feels good to get a workout in, though.

25:05.510 --> 25:09.090
- Ruby, wait.
(swelling, ominous music)

25:09.090 --> 25:09.923
There's.

25:11.593 --> 25:12.426
- What?

25:14.240 --> 25:16.230
- There was someone, it
showed another viewer

25:16.230 --> 25:17.063
and then it was gone.

25:17.063 --> 25:19.193
- Girl, I think you need to
lay off the drinks, okay?

25:20.100 --> 25:21.053
- Very funny.

25:29.090 --> 25:31.880
- No seriously, though,
I feel like a sweaty pig.

25:31.880 --> 25:33.740
I'm gonna go wash my body.

25:33.740 --> 25:36.320
- All right, love you. (kisses)

25:36.320 --> 25:37.280
- Bye.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.743
- [Angie] Yeah, see you later.

25:39.737 --> 25:42.987
(eerie, ominous music)

25:59.625 --> 26:02.625
(suspenseful music)

26:12.600 --> 26:14.493
- My brain just won't turn off.

26:16.030 --> 26:19.333
I feel overwhelmed and confused.

26:21.150 --> 26:22.400
Where do we go from here?

26:24.897 --> 26:25.860
(eerie, ominous music)
This stuck feeling,

26:25.860 --> 26:27.706
like I'm just spinning deeper and deeper

26:27.706 --> 26:31.583
into the void.
(phone ringing)

26:33.390 --> 26:34.290
Hello?

26:34.290 --> 26:37.070
- [Angie] Girl, turn on the
news, this shit is getting real.

26:37.070 --> 26:38.100
- (scoffs) Really?

26:38.100 --> 26:39.070
- Just do it.

26:39.070 --> 26:41.510
- Okay, okay, I'll go turn it on.

26:41.510 --> 26:44.000
You do know that you get worked
up real easily though right?

26:44.000 --> 26:45.230
- This is different and you know it.

26:45.230 --> 26:48.013
- Okay, okay, we'll see about that.

26:49.587 --> 26:52.337
(dramatic music)

26:56.510 --> 26:58.970
- Officials are still
working to trace the origin

26:58.970 --> 27:00.440
of the novel virus.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.320
We now know it has been confirmed

27:02.320 --> 27:03.850
in both humans and animals,

27:03.850 --> 27:06.900
and is rapidly spreading across the globe.

27:06.900 --> 27:09.450
With three cases in California confirmed,

27:09.450 --> 27:12.380
fear amongst local
citizens is on the rise.

27:12.380 --> 27:14.060
With current death tolls jumping

27:14.060 --> 27:15.840
into the thousands in what seems

27:15.840 --> 27:19.050
to be an overnight event,
the World Health Organization

27:19.050 --> 27:21.670
is asking everyone to stay home.

27:21.670 --> 27:24.316
- I knew it, we are so fucked.

27:24.316 --> 27:26.520
- Shh.
(eerie music)

27:26.520 --> 27:28.640
- We urge citizens to stay safe

27:28.640 --> 27:30.750
by taking these following steps.

27:30.750 --> 27:34.470
Wash and sanitize all
touched surfaces in the home,

27:34.470 --> 27:36.710
wash your hands thoroughly and often,

27:36.710 --> 27:39.060
and avoid touching your face.

27:39.060 --> 27:41.683
This is Wendy D, reporting for KLOL.

27:43.140 --> 27:45.052
- Good thing our cribs are spic and span.

27:45.052 --> 27:46.490
- (sighs) Yeah.

27:46.490 --> 27:47.880
God, this is scary.

27:47.880 --> 27:50.400
- I'm telling you, this
is just the beginning.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.330
My cousin is in the military
and said they're being briefed

27:52.330 --> 27:53.797
on all sorts of stuff right now.

27:53.797 --> 27:57.460
- I bet, but the stay at home
thing seems like a bit much,

27:57.460 --> 27:59.870
considering there's not even
any confirmed cases here.

27:59.870 --> 28:02.970
- People need to work, and

41:50.720 --> 41:51.951
A little leaf.

41:51.951 --> 41:53.860
(crowd cheers)

41:53.860 --> 41:55.970
Now for those that are carnivorous,

41:55.970 --> 41:57.680
we've got you covered, as well.

41:59.129 --> 42:02.069
(stabbing)
I'm not leaving anybody out.

42:02.069 --> 42:04.652
(crowd laughs)

42:07.505 --> 42:10.285
(sighs)

42:10.285 --> 42:14.335
Fresh goodness.
(crowd cheers)

42:14.335 --> 42:19.335
(smooth R&B music)
(humming)

42:28.306 --> 42:31.056
(doorbell rings)

42:32.295 --> 42:34.020
(sighs) I would like to thank
each and every one of you

42:34.020 --> 42:36.410
for being here tonight. (claps)

42:36.410 --> 42:38.660
This is so exciting.

42:38.660 --> 42:39.889
This is to you, king of the jungle.

42:39.889 --> 42:40.722
(glass clinks)
(lion growls)

42:40.722 --> 42:42.370
I know you've been very busy lately,

42:42.370 --> 42:44.491
and to you, mystical one.
(man laughing)

42:44.491 --> 42:46.360
And to you.
(ominous music)

42:46.360 --> 42:47.490
We'll talk later.

42:47.490 --> 42:48.830
And to my friend here.

42:48.830 --> 42:53.830
In case anybody gets rambunctious,
don't act up, all right?

42:53.840 --> 42:55.880
Yeah, this is great, you know.

42:55.880 --> 42:56.940
A special occasion.

42:56.940 --> 42:59.890
I'm glad that you guys
are all here with me.

42:59.890 --> 43:01.420
Well, you guys are a lively bunch.

43:01.420 --> 43:04.681
I thought we were gonna, you
know, party or something.

43:04.681 --> 43:06.792
(dishes clink)

43:06.792 --> 43:08.200
You eat up all my food.

43:08.200 --> 43:09.897
You didn't even offer to clean up.

43:09.897 --> 43:11.910
I mean, kinda rude.

43:11.910 --> 43:12.743
Time to go.

43:15.229 --> 43:18.229
(sensual R&B music)

43:43.980 --> 43:45.483
Stuck in my mind.

43:46.870 --> 43:47.703
Am I safe?

43:49.293 --> 43:51.143
I just wanna feel normal.

43:52.650 --> 43:53.903
What is normal anyways?

43:56.160 --> 43:57.903
Where do we go when we fall asleep?

43:59.380 --> 44:01.240
That feeling when you
gently start to slip away

44:01.240 --> 44:02.430
and then, boom.
(sensual R&B music)

44:02.430 --> 44:03.950
Terror.

44:03.950 --> 44:06.461
And you're right back where you started.

44:06.461 --> 44:09.128
(phone ringing)

44:17.480 --> 44:18.313
- [Nate] Ruby?

44:19.200 --> 44:20.033
Hello?

44:21.510 --> 44:22.343
You there?

44:24.130 --> 44:25.996
Hey, I was thinking of
swinging by this week,

44:25.996 --> 44:30.996
dropping off some supplies.

I no longer want you here.

45:58.728 --> 46:01.645
(gunshots popping)

46:04.587 --> 46:06.253
You son of a bitch!

46:06.253 --> 46:07.086
- Wait, wait, no.

46:07.086 --> 46:12.919
No, wait, wait.
No, no.
(gunshots popping)

46:15.064 --> 46:18.231
(eerie ringing music)

46:33.060 --> 46:36.250
- As some people are
concerned with loss of income,

46:36.250 --> 46:38.290
others are dealing with mental illness

46:38.290 --> 46:40.650
and domestic violence issues or both,

46:40.650 --> 46:43.270
due to the shelter in place order.

46:43.270 --> 46:44.763
This has affected us all.

46:45.930 --> 46:47.004
- Come on, Ruby.

46:47.004 --> 46:51.010
(stammers) I need to take a
piss, are you gonna let me in?

46:51.010 --> 46:54.840
- Hello in there. (chuckles)

46:54.840 --> 46:56.390
- Haven't seen you for a while.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.080
How have you been?

46:59.080 --> 47:02.240
- Fucking great, now teach me.

47:02.240 --> 47:03.073
- Shit.

47:05.992 --> 47:07.640
(whimsical music)

47:07.640 --> 47:10.010
- Okay, let's get to it.

47:10.010 --> 47:14.613
Remember, always start slow.

47:16.380 --> 47:18.880
(eerie music)

47:20.840 --> 47:25.840
(slaps) Apply pressure. (slaps)

47:30.840 --> 47:32.530
- Dammit Ruby, I gotta piss.

47:34.852 --> 47:35.852
- Good girl.

47:37.972 --> 47:39.759
You got this.

47:39.759 --> 47:41.926
(giggles)

47:44.122 --> 47:46.154
(groans)

47:46.154 --> 47:48.130
(tapping hurriedly)

47:48.130 --> 47:51.843
Now, Madam Winn Dee has to
get ready for her day job.

47:53.300 --> 47:55.780
Stay safe. (kisses)

47:57.343 --> 48:00.426
(giggles and kisses)

48:04.530 --> 48:06.463
- Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

48:11.355 --> 48:15.752
(exhales sharply) Jesus Christ.

48:15.752 --> 48:19.002
(eerie, ominous music)

48:42.302 --> 48:43.135
- You.

48:56.390 --> 48:59.158
Is this what you want from me?

48:59.158 --> 49:00.408
Do you like what you see?

49:02.390 --> 49:04.123
Do you like watching me go crazy?

49:10.280 --> 49:12.167
Am I entertaining for you?

49:16.913 --> 49:19.503
Have you got nothing better
to do with your time?

49:25.891 --> 49:28.558
Why don't I give me something...

49:32.820 --> 49:34.233
to watch?

49:35.740 --> 49:37.223
Would that make you happy?

49:39.200 --> 49:40.033
Piece of shit.

49:43.480 --> 49:45.030
Are you sitting there laughing?

49:46.340 --> 49:47.173
Is this funny?

49:49.900 --> 49:52.363
Is it funny to you that I'm struggling?

49:55.170 --> 49:57.970
Is this where I'm stuck, is
this where I'm gonna be now?

50:01.830 --> 50:03.663
Is this what you want?

50:04.927 --> 50:07.263
Is it fun for you to see me struggle?

50:08.820 --> 50:10.093
You piece of shit.

50:11.030 --> 50:12.903
Are you laughing? (sobs)

50:31.840 --> 50:33.523
- Hey, Ruby.

50:35.126 --> 50:36.330
You all right?

50:36.330 --> 50:39.020
Maybe we can chat
through the window a bit.

50:39.020 --> 50:40.510
Ruby?

50:40.510 --> 50:43.127
Ruby, Ru-bay, you there?

50:44.008 --> 50:47.008
(upbeat rock music)

51:04.550 --> 51:07.050
(car revving)

51:08.128 --> 51:09.795
Oh come on, come on.

51:17.726 --> 51:20.726
(brakes screeching)

51:30.950 --> 51:31.783
(panicked tapping)

51:31.783 --> 51:32.663
Ruby, open up.

51:34.140 --> 51:35.283
Ruby, Ruby, open up.

51:37.145 --> 51:38.145
Ruby, hello?

51:41.590 --> 51:43.143
Ruby, hello?

51:44.230 --> 51:46.720
- Nate, go away.

51:46.720 --> 51:47.553
- Oh, Ruby.

51:47.553 --> 51:49.400
Oh, thank God, open the door.

51:49.400 --> 51:50.433
- No fucking way.

51:52.010 --> 51:54.030
- What, it's me, Nate.

51:54.030 --> 51:55.890
Open the door, please.

51:55.890 --> 51:57.300
- Yeah, and catch the fucking plague?

51:57.300 --> 51:59.440
No way, absolutely not. (bangs)

51:59.440 --> 52:00.400
- It doesn't work that way.

52:00.400 --> 52:01.933
Trust me, just open the door.

52:07.547 --> 52:08.380
Hey.

52:09.861 --> 52:14.861
What, no.
(gunshots popping)

52:18.701 --> 52:20.449
Okay, okay, you got me.

52:20.449 --> 52:22.322
(gunshots popping)
Shit, can we talk?

52:22.322 --> 52:25.036
(gunshots popping)
Damn.

52:25.036 --> 52:27.369
(cat meows)

52:29.904 --> 52:32.404
(door creaks)

52:37.346 --> 52:40.346
(ominous whooshing)

52:42.519 --> 52:43.352
All right.

52:49.127 --> 52:51.143
(sighs) All right, friend.

52:52.450 --> 52:53.283
How you doing?

52:55.280 --> 52:56.113
- What?

52:56.970 --> 52:58.597
Why?

52:58.597 --> 52:59.623
I'm fine.

53:01.185 --> 53:03.693
- I tried calling you a bunch of times.

53:05.200 --> 53:07.210
So did Angie and your dad.

53:07.210 --> 53:09.952
He actually called me,
tripping out last night.

53:09.952 --> 53:12.035
(scoffs)

53:14.610 --> 53:15.513
Can't handle it?

53:18.570 --> 53:21.088
Got everything you need, got your meds?

53:21.088 --> 53:26.987
- I could use more.
If I could just please get
some sleep, some quiet.

53:30.210 --> 53:31.043
I'll be fine.

53:33.762 --> 53:35.360
Whoa!

53:35.360 --> 53:37.270
- Okay, I'm right here.

53:37.270 --> 53:39.684
I'm a little concerned,
if I'm being honest.

53:39.684 --> 53:42.543
- (scoffs) Thanks for the
fucking concern and all.

53:44.935 --> 53:47.257
I'm not allowed to have a little fun?

53:49.165 --> 53:50.120
- [Nate] (sighs) Look, why
don't you come with me,

53:50.120 --> 53:52.303
all right?
We'll go on a drive.

53:53.440 --> 53:55.473
You can just relax, zone out.

53:56.830 --> 53:59.863
We'll go get your meds, get you some food.

54:01.101 --> 54:04.160
- (sobbing) You want me,
you want me to go out there?

54:04.160 --> 54:05.390
Out there?

54:05.390 --> 54:09.113
The virus, it's everywhere.

54:09.960 --> 54:11.400
It's everywhere!

54:11.400 --> 54:14.961
And people are acting like
fucking savages out there.

54:14.961 --> 54:16.430
- (sighs) Look--

54:16.430 --> 54:18.350
- Yo, back the fuck up!

54:18.350 --> 54:19.213
Back up.

54:20.650 --> 54:22.940
- Look, you don't have to
worry about anything, okay?

54:22.940 --> 54:24.890
I've been tested, I don't have the virus.

54:24.890 --> 54:27.210
It's mandatory at my
job to get tested, okay?

54:27.210 --> 54:28.480
Look, you're gonna be fine, all right?

54:28.480 --> 54:30.053
I got everything that we need.

54:31.341 --> 54:34.059
And trust me, okay, it's gonna be okay.

54:34.059 --> 54:35.630
(resonant, emotional music)

54:35.630 --> 54:36.743
Just trust me.

54:37.752 --> 54:42.223
(stammers) I got gloves, I got sanitizer.

54:43.250 --> 54:44.750
I got a zombie rig.

54:44.750 --> 54:48.393
You gotta check this shit out, all right?

54:52.264 --> 54:54.353
- (stammers) Why didn't
you say that sooner?

54:56.730 --> 54:58.080
Are you sure you have sanitizer?

54:58.080 --> 54:59.363
- I got sanitizer.

55:04.303 --> 55:06.023
Why don't I do my whole body with this?

55:11.173 --> 55:12.470
Do you wanna get some shoes?

55:12.470 --> 55:14.040
You got, got one.

55:14.040 --> 55:15.975
Okay, one shoe, that works.

55:15.975 --> 55:16.808
Yeah, see?

55:18.346 --> 55:20.310
Isn't it nice outside?

55:20.310 --> 55:22.466
Yeah, take a deep breath.

55:22.466 --> 55:23.563
(Ruby breathes deeply)
You're all right.

55:29.690 --> 55:30.994
What's up?

55:30.994 --> 55:33.583
(panicked breathing)

55:33.583 --> 55:35.040
- (grunts) Stay away from me.

55:35.040 --> 55:36.140
- Where are you going?

55:37.470 --> 55:40.863
- Jesus, are you kidding me, Ruby?

55:40.863 --> 55:44.914
(slow, somber music)
Come on.

55:44.914 --> 55:45.914
Oh, come on.

55:46.971 --> 55:49.869
Ruby, come on, you know I have asthma.

55:49.869 --> 55:51.619
- You're a fucking liar!

55:51.619 --> 55:54.202
(Ruby panting)

55:57.669 --> 56:02.669
- (wheezing) Ruby. (panting)

56:17.368 --> 56:18.650
Ruby, come on.

56:18.650 --> 56:20.950
I'm not a marathon man,
you know I got asthma.

56:21.949 --> 56:24.290
- Nate, what do you want from me?

56:24.290 --> 56:26.780
- I know some of us need a
little bit more help than others,

56:26.780 --> 56:28.910
but that's why I'm here
for you, all right?

56:28.910 --> 56:32.290
Look, I just ran. I got
fucking asthma, man.

56:32.290 --> 56:34.510
You don't see me dying in the street.

56:34.510 --> 56:36.050
- How am I supposed to
trust anyone right now?

56:36.050 --> 56:37.300
This is crazy.
(somber, heartfelt music)

56:37.300 --> 56:39.860
- Look, I know we're all scared right now.

56:39.860 --> 56:42.220
I know everyone's scared,
none of us have ever dealt

56:42.220 --> 56:45.980
with anything like this, but I got you.

56:45.980 --> 56:46.940
- What's the point?

56:46.940 --> 56:48.690
- You know I'm here for you, okay?

56:48.690 --> 56:51.060
I love you.
(bright music)

56:51.060 --> 56:52.940
Do you see that?
I love you.

56:52.940 --> 56:53.773
- Really?

56:55.670 --> 56:57.083
Really?

56:57.083 --> 56:58.410
Really, why?

56:58.410 --> 57:00.243
Why, you know I don't deserve you.

57:03.260 --> 57:05.010
- Don't, don't say that.

57:05.010 --> 57:06.033
Why, why not?

57:07.440 --> 57:09.790
I feel like I don't
deserve you, half the time.

57:11.260 --> 57:15.290
Like yeah, I watch you and I see,

57:15.290 --> 57:16.580
you know, what you do to yourself

57:16.580 --> 57:19.670
and I feel like I should have been there.

57:19.670 --> 57:20.780
Like actually been there.

57:20.780 --> 57:22.580
Not just watching you, but be there.

57:23.470 --> 57:27.230
I feel like I don't even
deserve that after what I did.

57:27.230 --> 57:29.360
- You've been watching me this whole time?

57:29.360 --> 57:30.210
What do you mean?

57:31.090 --> 57:33.563
- What do you mean me,
I mean, did you see me?

57:35.130 --> 57:37.480
Like, I'm just watching over you.

57:37.480 --> 57:38.790
I just need to make sure you're okay.

57:38.790 --> 57:40.190
So yeah, I've been watching you.

57:40.190 --> 57:44.210
Like when you cut yourself
and like when your dad called.

57:44.210 --> 57:47.640
Hey, it was cathartic, it
was beautiful, it was manic.

57:47.640 --> 57:49.470
Slightly terrifying at times, yes,

57:49.470 --> 57:52.880
but you, even on all your
states of being, I accept you.

57:52.880 --> 57:56.510
God, I love you, I always
have and I always will.

57:56.510 --> 57:59.360
- Mm-hm, yeah, sure.

57:59.360 --> 58:01.560
Right, love, that's real cute.

58:01.560 --> 58:04.180
That's cute, I like that, love.

58:04.180 --> 58:05.700
Is that what we're supposed to do now?

58:05.700 --> 58:08.010
- Yes.
(heartfelt music)

58:08.010 --> 58:09.820
- Okay, okay.

58:09.820 --> 58:11.690
- I get it, I get you.

58:11.690 --> 58:13.810
I've always loved you.

58:13.810 --> 58:15.230
- Why me?

58:15.230 --> 58:17.080
- Like I fucking love you!

58:17.080 --> 58:20.530
Don't you see that?
I nearly died trying to catch up with you

58:20.530 --> 58:23.260
in the fucking zombie ass streets.

58:23.260 --> 58:26.450
I got a zombie rig I got
decked out just for you.

58:26.450 --> 58:27.850
You know how much that cost?

58:29.650 --> 58:31.053
- Fine, fine, fine.

58:35.320 --> 58:36.153
- It's okay.

58:40.050 --> 58:41.090
Come on, one step.

58:41.090 --> 58:42.610
One step closer, two steps back.

58:42.610 --> 58:44.273
You know that Paula Abdul song?

58:45.148 --> 58:46.070
(scoffs)
No, it's a joke, all right?

58:46.070 --> 58:47.223
Come on, it's okay.

58:48.623 --> 58:50.720
It's okay, see?

58:50.720 --> 58:51.923
Look, I'm not dying.

58:53.263 --> 58:56.505
(whimsical music)

58:56.505 --> 58:57.651
- [Ruby] Nate, what made you send me

58:57.651 --> 58:59.530
all those crazy packages?

58:59.530 --> 59:00.480
I mean, some of them were pretty cool,

59:00.480 --> 59:02.623
but others left me kinda confused.

59:03.632 --> 59:04.770
- Packages?

59:04.770 --> 59:05.603
- Yeah.

59:05.603 --> 59:08.198
- I saw all that stuff
all over your house.

59:08.198 --> 59:10.989
(bright, heartfelt music drowns out voice)

59:10.989 --> 59:11.822
- Really?

59:12.878 --> 59:14.189
You sure?

59:14.189 --> 59:19.189
(bright, heartfelt music
drowns out conversation)

59:22.090 --> 59:23.050
