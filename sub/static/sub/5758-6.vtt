<i>Previously on Pretty Little Liars...
There was a hoodie watching us.</i>

00:05.496 --> 00:07.497
<i>What if "A" put</i>
<i>Garrett's mom in the hospital</i>

00:07.532 --> 00:08.699
to get Garrett out of jail?

00:08.734 --> 00:11.568
I'm done, Hanna.
Are you breaking up with me?

00:11.604 --> 00:13.805
Spencer, you were right.
I'm withdrawing the reward.

00:13.839 --> 00:15.873
The truth always
comes out, Jason.

00:15.908 --> 00:17.643
Meet me in the parking lot
in 15 minutes.

00:17.677 --> 00:19.545
We know that somewhere
between being with us

00:19.579 --> 00:21.781
<i>and getting to Alison's grave,</i>
<i>you were with Jenna.</i>

00:21.815 --> 00:23.682
We just have to find out
what happened that night.

00:23.716 --> 00:25.684
My boss volunteered
the bank staff to help out

00:25.718 --> 00:27.619
at a rummage sale
at the church.

00:27.654 --> 00:29.821
<i>Em, I just found the gray
jacket from that night.</i>

00:29.856 --> 00:31.757
It just came out of
a donation box.

00:31.791 --> 00:33.526
Are you here
without an assistant?

00:33.560 --> 00:35.695
If you know anyone who's interested...
I'm interested.

00:35.729 --> 00:37.764
He's writing a note
for the flowers.

00:37.799 --> 00:41.468
His mom is in a coma. She's
not doing a lot of reading.

00:45.508 --> 00:47.776
Hanna, slow down.
You almost tripped over

00:47.810 --> 00:50.512
a catheter back there that was
still attached to someone.

00:50.546 --> 00:51.880
312, 312...

00:52.949 --> 00:54.515
There it is.

00:55.817 --> 00:56.918
We need to have a plan.

00:56.952 --> 00:59.453
We <i>have</i> a plan.
Exposing "A."

00:59.487 --> 01:00.520
Inside voice. Okay.

01:00.555 --> 01:01.855
What is the plan exactly?

01:01.889 --> 01:03.689
We're going to
replace Garrett's note

01:03.724 --> 01:05.658
with a fake note that we wrote.

01:05.692 --> 01:07.760
I know that part. I came
up with it, remember?

01:07.795 --> 01:09.730
I was wondering why
you were asking me that.

01:09.764 --> 01:11.699
But we still need
a place to lead "A."

01:11.733 --> 01:15.570
Rosewood church, by the organ
in the main sanctuary, tonight.

01:15.604 --> 01:18.440
How did you come up with that?
I have been living there

01:18.474 --> 01:21.477
since my mom signed me up to sort through
spandex shorts and granny panties.

01:21.511 --> 01:23.512
But won't the church be locked?

01:23.546 --> 01:25.680
That's the point.
It's deserted at night.

01:25.714 --> 01:27.849
So when Lucas shows up...
it's not gonna be Lucas!

01:27.883 --> 01:30.452
Yes, it will, han, he had the pills.
Fine!

01:30.487 --> 01:33.422
Then I'll show up with a paddle and
finish what I started at the lake.

01:33.456 --> 01:34.790
Whoa.

01:34.824 --> 01:37.527
What happened to the girl who
wouldn't get out of her sweats?

01:37.561 --> 01:39.830
She traded them for fatigues.
I'll write that.

01:39.864 --> 01:42.599
Are you sure you know how?
Yes.

01:42.633 --> 01:45.636
I've been forging my mom's signature
since seventh grade in p.E.

01:56.748 --> 01:58.716
Wow. This is really good.

02:02.820 --> 02:05.421
Yell if you see anyone,
all right?

02:05.456 --> 02:06.823
Are you sure that
you want to do it?

02:06.857 --> 02:11.461
This "A" broke me and Caleb up,
do you understand?

02:11.495 --> 02:13.563
They're gonna
have to pay for that.

02:19.837 --> 02:22.606

rhythmically )

02:40.592 --> 02:41.859

She's just weird about

you'd get a second.

Yeah. That's what
I figured.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.623
I don't understand.
Why would you want to do that?

04:17.658 --> 04:20.760

about this job. I am.

04:20.793 --> 04:23.396

Hanna's still really
torn up over Caleb,

04:26.533 --> 04:28.467
so we were all gonna
get together tonight

04:28.502 --> 04:29.869
to try and cheer her up.

04:29.903 --> 04:33.405
Your friends know it's a great
opportunity for you.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.441
Besides, we gotta
pool our resources together.

Don't.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.705
Okay, your turn.

and showed her the place,

05:43.543 --> 05:45.544

05:45.579 --> 05:47.813
I think I did a good job.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.715
Once I finish putting
the beams in the loft,

05:49.750 --> 05:53.786
she said they'd be interested
for them. Ng some custom work

05:53.820 --> 05:56.488
that's great.

05:56.523 --> 06:00.393
She even gave my name to an architect she knows.
( Cellphone chimes )

06:00.427 --> 06:02.596
That... that's great.
Spencer.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.666
Hmm?
You're doing it again.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.468
I'm sorry.

06:07.502 --> 06:10.471
I know that I've been a little
bit distracted recently.

06:10.505 --> 06:12.840
I just... I have
so much on my plate.

06:12.874 --> 06:15.643
I have this project that's
due on Monday... okay. Okay.

06:15.677 --> 06:17.745
I'll let you work.
Thank you.

06:17.780 --> 06:21.449
I'll just sit next to you
and I'll watch you type.

06:21.483 --> 06:22.850
I'll be very quiet.

06:24.686 --> 06:26.454
Okay.

06:26.488 --> 06:29.523
( Typing )

06:29.558 --> 06:30.591
I...

06:38.467 --> 06:41.669
mm. That's not...

06:41.704 --> 06:44.439
Distracting at all.

06:45.708 --> 06:47.676
Just do you know.
( Door slams )

06:47.710 --> 06:49.677
Hi! Dad!
How was your run?

06:49.712 --> 06:52.781
It was fine.

06:52.815 --> 06:55.617
I miss the days
when you ran with me.

06:57.853 --> 06:59.520
I guess...

06:59.554 --> 07:00.821
I guess I'll take off.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.856
I'll call you later, okay?

07:13.568 --> 07:14.768
Where's mom?

07:14.803 --> 07:17.438
She, uh, had to work today.

07:17.472 --> 07:20.574
On what case?
She got called in early.

07:20.608 --> 07:23.443
Time-sensitive issue.

07:23.477 --> 07:26.446
Dad, you didn't
answer my question.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.782
Don't needle me, Spencer. I'm
not the one working on it.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.550
So it <i>is</i> Garrett's case.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.852
I know how crazy
you get about this stuff.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.454
So what happened?

07:34.488 --> 07:36.422
I shouldn't have brought it up.

07:36.457 --> 07:37.623
I brought it up.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.859
You're gonna read about it
in the papers anyway.

07:39.893 --> 07:43.796
Turns out the physical evidence that
the police had on Garrett Reynolds,

07:43.831 --> 07:47.533
well, it...
It can't be re-tested.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.736
Why not?

07:49.770 --> 07:52.738
They either don't have enough of it or
what they do have has been tainted.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.641
Something along those lines. Why
do they even have to re-test it?

07:55.676 --> 07:57.610
If it tested positively
the first time...

07:57.644 --> 07:58.878
all I know is that
your mother is pushing

07:58.912 --> 08:01.347
for the judge to rule
the evidence inadmissible,

08:01.382 --> 08:04.684
and it looks like she's gonna
get what she wants. As usual.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.420
But if they can't use it...

08:07.454 --> 08:09.789
isn't the prosecution
relying on this evidence?

08:09.824 --> 08:11.791
Without it
they won't have a case!

08:11.826 --> 08:13.693
That's what
your mother's hoping.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.866
Where are you going?
Out!

08:22.471 --> 08:23.605
( Door slams )

08:23.639 --> 08:25.607
Thanks.

08:25.641 --> 08:27.842
Hey.
Did you get my text?

08:27.877 --> 08:30.478
I haven't had time to sneeze.

08:30.512 --> 08:33.414
How'd it go? Did Spence replace the note?
No. I did it.

08:33.448 --> 08:34.616
But you're scared of old people.

08:34.650 --> 08:36.583
Yeah, and apparently
they're scared of me too.

08:36.619 --> 08:38.519
I touch the woman
and she nearly croaked.

08:38.554 --> 08:41.556
What happened?
Look, I came to give you this.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.759
It's the pick-up location of the
bag that your jacket came from.

08:45.794 --> 08:48.863
Is this even in rosewood? No, but I thought
we'd go tomorrow and check it out.

08:48.897 --> 08:51.532
Why not today? Because
after you're done working

08:51.567 --> 08:52.800
we're going straight
to the church.

08:52.835 --> 08:55.503
Meet me at home?
Yeah, I'll see you later.

09:08.584 --> 09:10.385
Hey.

09:10.419 --> 09:12.387
So what's up?

09:12.421 --> 09:15.623
I need to talk to you
about Garrett. His case.

09:15.657 --> 09:18.526
Then you know...
about the evidence.

09:18.561 --> 09:19.727
So it has been thrown out?

09:19.762 --> 09:22.430
Not yet, but it will be.

09:22.464 --> 09:24.732
Look, I think I might
have a way to make sure

09:24.767 --> 09:26.668
that Garrett's case
<i>doesn't</i> fall apart.

09:26.702 --> 09:28.636
But I'm at a dead end,
and at this point

09:28.671 --> 09:30.805
the only person who might
be able to help me is you.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.408
What can I do?

09:35.544 --> 09:37.846
Do you know somebody
named April rose?

09:40.583 --> 09:43.685
So you've never heard of her?

09:58.900 --> 10:01.969
Would you believe I used to
wear a pair just like these?

10:02.003 --> 10:03.871
With a suede French vest.

10:03.905 --> 10:06.173
Wanted to look like
cat Stevens.

10:06.207 --> 10:09.877
Well, if find a hat with a squirrel
tail on it, I'll let you know.

10:09.911 --> 10:13.280
Um, that's Davey Crockett, and
I'd be wearing a raccoon cap.

10:15.083 --> 10:17.985
Looks like you've got
an interesting system going.

10:18.019 --> 10:20.186
Oh. Yeah, I'm organizing
them into seasons.

10:20.221 --> 10:24.090
We have fall, winter,
spring, summer...

10:24.125 --> 10:27.160
Resort.
Oh. How innovative.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.996
Is your mom coming today?

10:30.030 --> 10:33.199
No, she can't.
She had to take the car in.

10:33.233 --> 10:37.136
Oh. Well, I guess I'll see
you at the party tonight.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.104
What party?

10:39.138 --> 10:41.940
I made an announcement
about it like 15 minutes ago.

10:41.975 --> 10:46.011
The council throws it for the
volunteers as a way of saying thanks.

10:46.045 --> 10:49.981
Oh. Well, thanks but no thanks.
I'm busy.

10:50.016 --> 10:51.983
Too bad.

10:52.018 --> 10:54.953
You haven't partied until you've
partied in the church rec room.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.190
Wait.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.927
The... the party's tonight?

11:01.961 --> 11:03.995
Here? At the church?

11:04.029 --> 11:06.864
Wanna change your plans now,
don't you?

11:11.236 --> 11:15.106
But to be honest, there were so many
girls hanging around us at the time

11:15.140 --> 11:17.876
I could have met her
and not even known it.

11:17.910 --> 11:19.177
And by "us," you mean...

11:19.211 --> 11:21.012
Garrett, Ian and I.

11:21.046 --> 11:24.149
Right. The n.A.T. Club.
How'd you know about that?

11:24.183 --> 11:26.318
Do you think that she could have been
one of the girls that you filmed?

11:26.352 --> 11:28.219
Well, I didn't film
any of those videos.

11:28.254 --> 11:32.089
Yeah, but you watched them.
Didn't you?

11:34.259 --> 11:39.129
How did you get that honor without
doing any of the grunt work?

11:39.164 --> 11:41.332
It was my idea.

11:41.366 --> 11:44.335
( Humorless chuckle )

11:44.370 --> 11:47.105
Look, like I said before,
I was messed up.

11:47.139 --> 11:50.976
High school was just
one big blur.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.212
Do you think she could have
been in one of the videos?

11:53.246 --> 11:55.147
It's possible.

11:55.182 --> 11:58.050
Or maybe she was just
one of their "employees."

11:58.084 --> 11:59.351
What does that mean?

11:59.385 --> 12:02.187
I think Ian and Garrett
were paying girls

12:02.222 --> 12:05.057
to set up their friends.

12:05.091 --> 12:08.193
I don't know. At that time I had
kind of walked away from it all.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.870
So were you guys
the only members?

12:17.904 --> 12:19.171
Officially? Yeah.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.074
But Ian had help.

12:21.108 --> 12:24.110
There's no way he could have
filmed it all on his own.

12:24.144 --> 12:29.216
At times, I even thought maybe he
was filming it for someone else.

12:30.985 --> 12:33.053
I'll catch up with you later.
Yeah.

12:38.293 --> 12:41.062
( Shower running )

13:02.985 --> 13:05.186
( Shower turns off )

13:18.300 --> 13:21.002
Hey, ezra,
I'm gonna have to run.

13:21.036 --> 13:22.937
Wait... right this minute?

13:24.340 --> 13:25.306
( Door opens )

13:25.341 --> 13:27.308
Not so fast.

13:27.343 --> 13:29.944
At least give me
a proper goodbye.

13:29.979 --> 13:32.147
Bye.

13:32.181 --> 13:34.016
Bye.

13:35.985 --> 13:37.919
I can't believe
you asked him that.

13:37.954 --> 13:39.187
We have to find this girl,

13:39.221 --> 13:41.222
and if anybody knows who
she is, it's Jason.

13:41.256 --> 13:42.323
Well, he doesn't.

13:42.357 --> 13:44.325
He might not have
recognized her name,

13:44.359 --> 13:46.293
but he could recognize her
by a picture.

13:46.327 --> 13:49.929
I wonder if April was the type of
girl who pimped out her friends.

13:49.964 --> 13:52.899
I don't know. All I know is that the
prosecution's case is crumbling,

13:52.933 --> 13:54.935
and we have to get to this girl
before "A" does.

13:54.969 --> 13:58.138
Whatever Garrett wants destroyed could be
the only thing left that keeps him in jail.

13:58.172 --> 14:00.841
Do you think Maya found those
tapes with Ali's stuff?

14:00.875 --> 14:03.977
It's possible. Maybe that's what
Garrett was after all along.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.278
Maybe April rose has a tape.

14:05.313 --> 14:07.281
Maybe that's what Garrett
wants "A" to destroy.

14:07.315 --> 14:10.050
What I don't get is why would "A"
take direction from Garrett?

14:10.084 --> 14:12.151
It might be
the other way around.

14:12.186 --> 14:14.087
Garrett might have done
whatever "A" told him to

14:14.121 --> 14:16.856
and that's how he wound up
behind bars.

14:16.890 --> 14:19.125
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.127
Finally. I'm starving.
Me too.

14:21.162 --> 14:23.863
Do you want to split some cheese fries?
No, I want my own.

14:23.898 --> 14:25.265
So, the plan's changed
for tonight.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.835
It's not a plan,
it's a suicide mission.

14:27.869 --> 14:29.169
The church is gonna be
crawling with people,

14:29.204 --> 14:31.105
so we're not gonna be able
to figure out who "A" is.

14:31.139 --> 14:35.209
Emily and I are gonna hide behind the
organ and just see who shows up.

14:35.243 --> 14:38.912
I don't think that you should... Spencer,
it's not about confronting, okay?

14:38.947 --> 14:42.015
I just want to see who it is so I'll
know how to plan a real attack.

14:44.018 --> 14:46.086
"We." When we attack.

14:46.120 --> 14:49.089
Just be careful.
And wear sensible shoes.

14:49.123 --> 14:51.258
Hey, I wear three inches
or I wear nothing.

14:51.292 --> 14:54.261
Oh, and order me a side salad.
To soak up the cheese.

15:00.102 --> 15:03.137
What's with you? You're
acting like a pod person.

15:03.172 --> 15:05.039
Hmm?

15:05.074 --> 15:06.908
Oh. I...

15:06.943 --> 15:09.811
I was just trying to remember how
much reward money Jason offered.

15:09.845 --> 15:11.179
$50,000. Why?

15:11.213 --> 15:13.248
And that was cash, right?
Yeah.

15:13.282 --> 15:16.851
Did he just have all that
money lying around his house?

15:16.885 --> 15:18.119
Well, I doubt it.

15:18.153 --> 15:21.989
But if someone did,
would that be weird?

15:22.024 --> 15:23.925
If you had that much cash
lying around,

15:23.959 --> 15:26.193
you'd probably also have
a bomb shelter

15:26.228 --> 15:29.197
and like five years' worth
of dehydrated meat.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.068
Or you're a criminal.

15:35.271 --> 15:38.874
I do want my own cheese fries.

15:42.045 --> 15:44.079
( No audible dialogue )

15:45.248 --> 15:46.882
Hey.

15:46.916 --> 15:50.219
Need to talk to you.
It's about Spencer.

15:50.253 --> 15:54.123
Jason. Please,
leave her out of this.

15:54.157 --> 15:57.059
I need her energy focused on
her future, not this trial.

15:57.094 --> 15:59.295
Maybe you should
tell your wife that.

15:59.329 --> 16:02.265
Jason, you're wrong
about Veronica.

16:02.299 --> 16:06.136
She didn't take this case
out of spite.

16:06.170 --> 16:07.871
She doesn't hate you.

16:07.905 --> 16:10.106
Well, no, I don't think
she hates me.

16:10.141 --> 16:12.275
I think she hates <i>you.</i>

16:13.978 --> 16:15.846
Look...

16:15.880 --> 16:18.815
I don't want my daughter's life
derailed any further.

16:18.849 --> 16:21.951
She needs to find a way to,
you know, put this behind her.

16:21.986 --> 16:23.920
The trial, your sister...

16:23.955 --> 16:26.256
which sister exactly
are you talking about?

16:26.290 --> 16:30.026
Because as it turns out,
I had more than one.

16:39.954 --> 16:43.047
Hey.
Finally. Let's go.

16:45.209 --> 16:49.012
Uh... hey, let me introduce you
to the art of conversation.

16:49.046 --> 16:50.946
"Hi! How was your day?"

16:50.980 --> 16:52.848
"My day was fine.
How was yours?"

16:52.882 --> 16:54.082
I'm sorry.
I just want to leave.

16:54.117 --> 16:56.217
I should say hi to Ted.

16:56.252 --> 16:58.086
Uh, can we <i>not?</i>

16:58.120 --> 17:00.922
That goober is literally
trying to be my best friend.

17:00.956 --> 17:03.157
Hanna, being kind and decent
doesn't make Ted a "goober."

17:03.192 --> 17:05.894
I know. It's the fact
that he says "howdy"

17:05.928 --> 17:08.762
and wears clothes
made of roadkill.

17:08.798 --> 17:11.933
What is up with you?

17:14.771 --> 17:18.873
Well, now that you mention it,
I'm goober's date tonight.

17:18.907 --> 17:20.842
What?
When did this happen?

17:20.877 --> 17:22.844
He called this morning.
And you said yes?!

17:25.080 --> 17:28.818
No. Mom. I... I'm sorry, you can't go.
Why not?

17:28.852 --> 17:32.155
Because I'm going to be there,
and that'll be weird.

17:32.189 --> 17:35.025
Hanna, you're not ten years old,
we don't need to hold hands.

17:35.059 --> 17:38.896
But I thought it might be nice
if we could drive together.

17:38.930 --> 17:41.198
No, we can't, because....

17:41.233 --> 17:43.835
Toby's picking me up.

17:43.869 --> 17:46.138
He's taking me to the dance.

17:46.172 --> 17:50.809
Why is Spencer's boyfriend
taking you to the dance?

17:50.843 --> 17:53.111
Is this about you
wanting to hurt Caleb?

17:53.146 --> 17:55.213
No, it's...

17:55.248 --> 17:58.116
there's this... Guy,
another volunteer,

17:58.150 --> 18:00.185
and he just won't take no
for an answer,

18:00.219 --> 18:03.121
so I thought if I take Toby,

18:03.156 --> 18:05.090
then maybe he'll finally
leave me alone.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.760
Is this something
I should be concerned about?

18:07.794 --> 18:11.230
No. He's just some do-gooder creep.
He's harmless.

18:46.099 --> 18:50.135
Spencer: <i>It's actually called
"the thank you dance"?</i>

18:50.169 --> 18:52.838
Who cares what it's called,
Spencer.

18:52.872 --> 18:54.940
Can you get Toby to
come with me or not?

18:54.975 --> 18:57.776
Han, it's bad enough
that <i>I</i> canceled a date with him

18:57.811 --> 18:59.845
without forcing him
to go on one with you.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.814
I don't want him involved.
Involved?

19:01.848 --> 19:03.849
He just has to stand there
and eat chips.

19:03.884 --> 19:06.786
I don't understand though. Why couldn't
you just come up with a better lie?

19:06.820 --> 19:08.120
I'm sorry.
I panicked, all right?

19:08.155 --> 19:10.890
It was like my mouth was talking
before my brain could catch up.

19:10.925 --> 19:12.892
You can make fun of me
all you want,

19:12.926 --> 19:14.828
but this whole plan
is falling apart!

19:14.862 --> 19:16.830
You don't think that
I'm taking this seriously?

19:16.864 --> 19:19.966
I've spent every waking moment
searching for this April girl.

19:20.001 --> 19:22.202
I've been in the library so much
I am on a first-name basis

19:22.237 --> 19:24.972
with the homeless guy that
sleeps next to the microfiche.

19:25.006 --> 19:27.041
What is this?
Police academy rosters.

19:27.075 --> 19:30.744
I thought maybe April and Garrett
went through training together.

19:30.778 --> 19:34.048
You think that another cop could
help him get away with murder?

19:35.217 --> 19:36.917
Like wilden?

19:36.952 --> 19:38.986
I don't know.

19:40.923 --> 19:43.024
Han, I thought that
we were done with all this.

19:43.058 --> 19:45.093
Yeah, me too.

19:47.029 --> 19:50.099
You know, last year...

19:50.133 --> 19:51.867
When things got really bad

19:51.902 --> 19:54.937
I used to fantasize about
what my life would be like

19:54.972 --> 19:57.040
if I had never met Ali.

19:57.074 --> 20:00.777
My biggest concern right now would
be where I wanted to go to college.

20:00.811 --> 20:02.779
I've had that fantasy too.

20:02.813 --> 20:05.248
Yeah, but every time
I go down that road,

20:05.282 --> 20:08.250
I have to remind myself
that if I hadn't met her,

20:08.285 --> 20:11.988
then I wouldn't be friends
with you.

20:12.022 --> 20:14.057
So what time
should Toby pick you up?

20:14.091 --> 20:16.159
Seven-thirty.

20:16.194 --> 20:20.130
Okay. Now go, so I can
keep looking through all this.

20:20.164 --> 20:22.099
Oh, and Spence...
hmm?

20:22.133 --> 20:24.869
We'll get there, okay?

20:24.903 --> 20:27.839
We've stopped Mona,
and we can stop this person.

20:27.873 --> 20:29.207
It's now or never.

20:29.241 --> 20:33.211
I know. It's the "never" part
that I'm afraid of.

20:43.890 --> 20:45.992
( Cellphone plinks)

20:53.101 --> 20:55.903
More coffee?
I'm done, thanks.

21:11.086 --> 21:14.922
<i>She don't look so good. Better get
her home before she passes out.</i>

21:40.950 --> 21:42.016
( Knock on door )

21:44.253 --> 21:46.287
Hey.
Found April rose.

21:46.321 --> 21:49.055
Did you talk to her?
It's not a "her."

21:49.090 --> 21:51.123
It's an "it."

21:52.959 --> 21:54.259
You're driving.

21:58.858 --> 22:01.014
( Tango music playing )

22:20.586 --> 22:21.948
You want some punch?

22:21.982 --> 22:23.576
Um...

22:23.611 --> 22:24.816
Oh, no thank you.

22:24.850 --> 22:26.995
I don't drink anything
that's not shrink-wrapped.

22:27.029 --> 22:30.936
So who am I here to scare off?

22:30.970 --> 22:34.841
What? The creep that's
been bothering you...?

22:34.876 --> 22:37.613
Oh! Right. Um...

22:37.648 --> 22:39.783
yeah, it's that guy over there.

22:44.660 --> 22:46.797
Hi, sweetie.
Hey.

22:46.831 --> 22:48.699
Hi, Toby.
Hi, Ms. marin.

22:48.733 --> 22:50.801
Toby, this is Ted.

22:50.835 --> 22:52.936
Howdy.
Nice to meet you.

22:52.971 --> 22:54.705
You too.
You're a very lucky man.

22:54.739 --> 22:58.742
What?! No. No, we're... we're
not... um, yeah.

22:58.776 --> 23:00.010
We're just friends.

23:02.980 --> 23:06.550
What do you say we try to
find the grown-up beverages?

23:06.584 --> 23:10.588
Don't kill the messenger,
but they're not serving alcohol.

23:10.622 --> 23:13.792
Oh. Right. Church.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.794
Maybe we should find
someone with a beard

23:15.828 --> 23:18.663
who can do that whole
turning-water-into-wine thing.

23:18.697 --> 23:20.932
If not, would you settle
for a root beer?

23:20.966 --> 23:24.636
Do you think it will ferment
if we let it stand long enough?

23:30.878 --> 23:32.812
Toby, come on.

23:36.817 --> 23:38.651
( No distinct dialogue )

23:44.758 --> 23:46.025
( Door bell jingles )

23:52.600 --> 23:53.900
( Door closes )

24:04.645 --> 24:07.747
Oh. Hi.
Good evening.

24:09.016 --> 24:10.984
Man: Good evening, folks.

24:11.018 --> 24:12.986
I'm getting ready
to close. Uh...

24:13.020 --> 24:15.656
How can I help you?

24:15.690 --> 24:16.890
We just came in
to pick up something

24:16.924 --> 24:18.725
that might have been set aside?

24:18.759 --> 24:20.560
Uh-huh.

24:20.594 --> 24:21.895
Were you asked
to hold anything?

24:21.929 --> 24:24.564
Half this shop.
( Chuckles)

24:24.598 --> 24:28.568
But I'm not holding my breath
anybody's coming back.

24:28.602 --> 24:31.738
Well, you see, a friend of
ours dropped something off

24:31.772 --> 24:33.705
and asked us to pick it up.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.805
But we don't know
exactly what it is,

24:35.840 --> 24:36.973
and our friend
can't be reached.

24:44.817 --> 24:48.754
Okay, so we can go classic
with "when Harry met Sally,"

24:48.788 --> 24:53.659
we can watch "the notebook"
for, like, the millionth time.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.660
I don't care.
You can decide.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.632
That's really pretty.

25:02.568 --> 25:05.537
Don't you love finding
new places to wear jewelry?

25:05.571 --> 25:07.573
I'm never taking it off.

25:07.607 --> 25:10.743
Who gave it to you?
No one special.

25:10.777 --> 25:12.879
Just another one of
the nameless, faceless

25:12.913 --> 25:15.648
revolving door of boyfriends
who adore you?

25:15.683 --> 25:19.019
No. Just a friend.

25:34.736 --> 25:36.970
I...Am going out.

25:38.906 --> 25:40.841
Are you kidding?

25:40.875 --> 25:42.943
My friend has a guy
who can get us I.D.'S.

25:42.977 --> 25:46.747
I'm going to a party to pick
him up, and then I'll be back.

25:46.781 --> 25:49.550
This is so typical.
Every time we make plans,

25:49.584 --> 25:52.619
if something better comes
along, you totally ditch me.

25:52.654 --> 25:55.823
Why are you spazzing? I'm making
sure we have the best summer ever.

25:55.857 --> 25:57.958
Instead of languishing
at the kiddie table,

25:57.993 --> 26:01.562
we'll be mixing up on futons
with frat boys.

26:09.971 --> 26:12.539
I gotta go.
My friend's here.

26:12.574 --> 26:15.011
Which friend?
You don't know her.

26:22.954 --> 26:24.955
You're sure this is it?
I'm positive.

26:24.990 --> 26:26.590
She never took it off.

26:26.625 --> 26:29.961
Uh, how much
do you want for this?

26:29.995 --> 26:33.598
I don't know. I've never
seen that before.

26:33.632 --> 26:34.932
I just found it
on this mannequin.

26:34.967 --> 26:37.969
Must have been brought in here
in the past couple of days.

26:38.003 --> 26:40.872
And you don't happen to know
who dropped it off?

26:40.906 --> 26:42.774
It's...

26:42.808 --> 26:46.912
there's no code, no tags.

26:46.946 --> 26:49.981
I can't sell it to you folks.
It's a display piece.

26:50.015 --> 26:52.684
How about if I give you
a hundred dollars?

26:52.718 --> 26:54.553
It's not my decision to make.

26:54.587 --> 26:57.823
Will two hundred
make it your decision?

26:57.857 --> 26:58.957
Four hundred.

27:10.936 --> 27:12.904
( Ringing )

27:12.939 --> 27:14.940
Hi.
<i>Where are you?</i>

27:14.974 --> 27:17.609
I'm sorry, I got held up.
<i>Well, get here.</i>

27:17.644 --> 27:18.977
<i>I can't face "A" alone.</i>

27:19.012 --> 27:21.713
Toby's getting suspicious,
and wilden is hovering.

27:21.747 --> 27:24.750
Wilden's there? Okay,
I'm leaving in five.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.821
( Soft rock plays )

27:35.562 --> 27:36.996
Here you are.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.998
Oh. Hey.

27:39.032 --> 27:41.600
Do you want to dance?

27:41.635 --> 27:42.968
No, thanks.

27:43.970 --> 27:46.606
All right, then.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.007
Wait. Toby.

27:55.750 --> 28:00.887
When you reach the summit, all you can hear
is the wind whistling through the rocks.

28:00.921 --> 28:02.956
Sounds... Incredible.

28:02.990 --> 28:04.891
I'd love to take you.

28:04.926 --> 28:07.561
If... You're interested.

28:07.595 --> 28:08.962
How about next Sunday?

28:08.996 --> 28:12.799
Well, Sunday's kind of
a busy day for me.

28:12.834 --> 28:15.702
Okay.
Sunday after that?

28:15.736 --> 28:20.740
Ah, the thing is,
I'm busy <i>every</i> Sunday.

28:20.775 --> 28:22.742
Oh.

28:22.777 --> 28:26.847
I thought Hanna must have
told you. I'm a pastor?

28:29.617 --> 28:31.751
Well, an associate pastor.

28:31.786 --> 28:34.858
No. She didn't.

28:37.028 --> 28:39.964
More root beer?
Yeah.

28:48.940 --> 28:50.575
( No audible dialogue )

28:55.915 --> 28:58.750
Hanna...
Why am I here?

28:58.785 --> 29:00.752
I told you. That guy...

29:00.787 --> 29:03.856
I know, you told me. But that kid
is scared of his own shadow,

29:03.890 --> 29:06.725
and he's definitely
scared of yours.

29:06.759 --> 29:08.861
So why am I here?

29:08.895 --> 29:12.731
Or maybe the question is:
Why are <i>you?</i>

29:12.765 --> 29:14.900
I told you.
I wanted to go to a party.

29:14.934 --> 29:19.771
Hanna, I have had naps more exciting
than this party, and so have you.

29:19.805 --> 29:23.575
Does this have to do with Caleb?
No.

29:27.613 --> 29:28.913
In a way.

29:28.948 --> 29:30.949
Hanna.

29:30.983 --> 29:33.786
I need to talk to you
for a second. Now.

29:33.820 --> 29:37.023
I'm really sorry, Toby.
I'll be right back, okay?

29:45.764 --> 29:47.698
( Dialing )

29:50.802 --> 29:53.937
Hey. Can you call me?

29:53.971 --> 29:57.774
I'm about to leave
this church... Thing.

29:57.808 --> 30:01.812
And I need to know why you
and Hanna lied to me.

30:06.584 --> 30:08.617
Why didn't you tell me
Ted was a pastor?

30:08.652 --> 30:10.816
He is?

30:10.850 --> 30:13.651
Hanna, I have just replayed
the last hour in my head,

30:13.686 --> 30:15.886
and I am this close
to crawling under a pew.

30:15.921 --> 30:19.689
Oh, my gosh.
You really like him.

30:19.724 --> 30:22.859
It's too late.
I blew it.

30:22.893 --> 30:24.727
No, you didn't.

30:26.629 --> 30:28.763
I made that joke
about them not serving booze.

30:28.798 --> 30:31.666
You like your wine.
I wore a dress with cleavage!

30:31.700 --> 30:34.035
Mom, that is practically
a turtleneck.

30:34.069 --> 30:37.739
Hanna, all it takes
is one glance at my resume

30:37.773 --> 30:40.608
to know that I am no angel.

30:40.643 --> 30:43.010
Who is?

30:51.752 --> 30:52.951
Hey.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.948
Oh. Hey, holden.

30:54.983 --> 30:57.917
So, uh, is your whole crew
coming tonight?

30:57.952 --> 31:00.987
No. Just me and Hanna.
Have you seen her?

31:01.021 --> 31:03.688
Yeah, she's, uh...

31:03.723 --> 31:05.790
Around here somewhere.

31:05.825 --> 31:08.793
Hey, relax.
Have a cupcake.

31:15.633 --> 31:17.934
When did you get that tattoo?

31:17.968 --> 31:20.703
Oh, it's not a...

31:22.740 --> 31:24.007
Is that for a club?

31:24.041 --> 31:27.677
Not a club so much as a party.

31:27.712 --> 31:29.846
It changes venues.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.680
You know, I...

31:31.714 --> 31:35.017
actually, I used to
see your friend there sometimes.

31:35.051 --> 31:37.019
W-what friend?

31:37.053 --> 31:40.690
Your girlfriend?
Maya?

31:42.793 --> 31:44.727
Hey, I gotta go.

32:01.889 --> 32:03.856
( Pop rock playing )

32:10.864 --> 32:12.665
Oh, there you are.
Sorry.

32:12.699 --> 32:14.500
Just wanted to check on Hanna.

32:14.534 --> 32:16.701
And how is she?
She's good.

32:16.736 --> 32:19.503
So, do you want to dance?

32:19.538 --> 32:20.970
I'd love to,
but word of warning,

32:21.005 --> 32:24.707
my dance moves start at "the running
man" and end at the "Roger rabbit."

32:27.644 --> 32:28.611
Hey, there, Ashley.

32:28.645 --> 32:31.714
Pastor.
Detective wilden, right?

32:31.748 --> 32:33.916
That's right,
but I'm off the clock.

32:33.951 --> 32:36.652
So am I. It's Ted.

32:36.686 --> 32:38.953
I'm happy to see you here,
if a little surprised.

32:38.988 --> 32:41.890
That's funny, I was just about to
say the same thing to Ms. marin.

32:41.924 --> 32:44.593
You two know each other?
Sure.

32:44.627 --> 32:46.561
We haven't seen each other
in a while.

32:48.564 --> 32:51.899
Detective wilden was an important
part of the Alison dilaurentis case.

32:51.933 --> 32:55.736
Hanna was a good friend of hers.
So our paths have crossed.

32:55.770 --> 32:58.638
And they'll probably
cross again.

32:58.672 --> 33:00.673
Anyway, have a good evening.

33:03.778 --> 33:05.779
Now, where were we?

33:05.813 --> 33:08.682
Oh, that's right. I was just
about to humiliate myself

33:08.716 --> 33:10.550
on the dance floor.

33:27.667 --> 33:30.701
I'm sorry, Ted. I just got
hit with a searing headache.

33:30.736 --> 33:32.637
Can I get you some aspirin?

33:32.671 --> 33:33.904
No.

33:33.938 --> 33:36.606
Then maybe we should sit down
for a little... thank you...

33:36.640 --> 33:38.808
I think I should just go home.

33:38.842 --> 33:40.909
Uh, sure.

33:40.944 --> 33:42.945
Let me walk you to the car.

33:44.914 --> 33:46.948
Toby:
<i>Hey, can you call me?</i>

33:46.983 --> 33:49.784
<i>I'm about to leave</i>
<i>this church... Thing.</i>

33:49.819 --> 33:53.621
<i>And I need to know why you
and Hanna lied to me.</i>

33:56.590 --> 33:57.925
Hey.
How did it go?

33:57.959 --> 33:59.593
As well as it could, I guess.

33:59.627 --> 34:01.528
I told 'em I got
an anonymous tip

34:01.563 --> 34:02.730
and they seemed to believe me.

34:02.764 --> 34:04.665
So when will we know when...

34:04.699 --> 34:05.799
he didn't say.

34:05.834 --> 34:07.468
What do we do now?

34:07.502 --> 34:08.569
Now we wait.

34:11.607 --> 34:15.810
Um... Do you still
have those letters?

34:15.844 --> 34:21.583
The ones that helped you figure
out that my dad is our dad.

34:22.751 --> 34:23.885
Yeah.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.920
May I see them?

34:25.955 --> 34:28.757
Oh, Spencer.
You don't want to do that.

34:28.791 --> 34:31.693
It'll just..Hurt.

34:32.828 --> 34:34.594
What?

34:34.630 --> 34:36.664
Uh...(Laughs)...

34:36.697 --> 34:38.599
Nothing. I was...

34:38.634 --> 34:41.670
Just thinking about how
different you are from Ali.

34:41.704 --> 34:43.972
I mean, the reason that you
don't want me to see them

34:44.005 --> 34:47.876
is the very reason
that she would want me to.

34:50.947 --> 34:55.618
I wonder what kind of person
she would have turned into.

34:55.652 --> 34:58.888
I mean, I see it with
the kids I work with,

34:58.922 --> 35:01.890
and at first
they're all attitude,

35:01.925 --> 35:04.493
but you peel back the layers

35:04.528 --> 35:07.597
and you usually
find a person underneath.

35:07.631 --> 35:09.832
Yeah, but with Ali,

35:09.866 --> 35:12.901
I'd keep peeling, I just...

35:12.936 --> 35:15.738
Always seemed to find
new layers.

35:17.907 --> 35:20.876
( Rock music playing )

35:25.948 --> 35:27.749
Emily.
Where have you been?

35:27.783 --> 35:29.651
I just had the weirdest
conversation with holden.

35:29.685 --> 35:30.852
What?
When were you with...

35:30.886 --> 35:32.554
I remembered something
from that night,

35:32.588 --> 35:33.822
and it might have
something to do with Maya.

35:33.856 --> 35:35.823
Holden seemed to know,
but he walked away.

35:35.858 --> 35:37.926
Well, let's find him.
I don't know where he went.

35:43.866 --> 35:45.800
Just go wait by
the side door, okay?

35:45.835 --> 35:47.938
I want to get there
before "A" does.

36:09.503 --> 36:12.705
( Door opens, closes )

36:19.948 --> 36:22.550
( Clatter)

37:08.417 --> 37:09.651
Don't lie to me, Hanna.

37:09.685 --> 37:11.519
A nurse found this,

37:11.553 --> 37:15.323
and wisely handed it over
to the police.

37:15.357 --> 37:16.658
I don't know what that is.

37:16.692 --> 37:19.594
Don't tell me you're here
for some peace and quiet.

37:19.629 --> 37:22.430
I was looking for someone.
Who?

37:23.666 --> 37:26.635
( Laughs )
Why are you helping him?

37:26.669 --> 37:29.505
I don't know who you're
talking about yeah, you do,

37:29.539 --> 37:31.540
but I'll play along.

37:31.574 --> 37:35.277
All that fuss you girls made,
pointing the finger at Ian.

37:35.312 --> 37:38.447
Was that all
for Garrett's sake?

37:38.482 --> 37:40.449
I have nothing to do with that.

37:40.484 --> 37:44.487
I don't get it, Hanna.
Why are you in <i>his</i> corner?

37:44.521 --> 37:48.324
My mom's downstairs.
Your mom <i>left.</i>

37:50.594 --> 37:53.697
You know, I bet when she was your
age she caused a lot of problems.

37:53.731 --> 37:57.634
But... She knows how
to get rid of problems.

37:57.668 --> 38:01.438
All you do is create 'em.

38:03.474 --> 38:04.507
I've gotta go.

38:14.318 --> 38:16.452
<i>There's people</i>
<i>he has to answer to.</i>

38:16.487 --> 38:20.524
<i>You always stand up
for him, don't ya?</i>

38:20.558 --> 38:22.526
( Door opens )

38:25.364 --> 38:26.531
Hey!
Hey.

38:34.339 --> 38:36.374
Did everything go okay
at work today?

38:36.409 --> 38:37.542
Yeah.

38:40.580 --> 38:42.348
No.

38:42.382 --> 38:43.616
Not at all, actually.

38:43.650 --> 38:46.721
I dropped two light meters,
I switched out a wrong lens

38:46.755 --> 38:49.557
and I punctured her mounts.

38:49.592 --> 38:51.393
Really?
Yeah.

38:51.428 --> 38:53.329
What happened?

38:53.363 --> 38:56.566
Well, I was a little
distracted...

38:58.336 --> 39:01.238
By what I found
in your sock drawer.

39:01.272 --> 39:02.572
Oh.

39:04.575 --> 39:06.543
It that why you
ran out of here today?

39:06.577 --> 39:09.379
I didn't know what to say.

39:13.251 --> 39:16.586
I can see how that
might look... Pretty bad.

39:16.621 --> 39:19.556
Ezra, where did
that money come from?

39:23.428 --> 39:26.397
I sold a car
my grandfather left me.

39:26.431 --> 39:28.432
A sixty-seven jag.

39:28.466 --> 39:30.601
I was hoping to
restore it one day,

39:30.635 --> 39:33.570
but now someone else has it

39:33.605 --> 39:37.307
and I have a sock drawer
with no socks.

39:37.342 --> 39:40.344
And they paid you in cash?

39:40.378 --> 39:43.447
Yeah, I let the guy pay me in cash
so he could have a break on taxes.

39:43.482 --> 39:47.519
Um, o-okay. Why didn't
you just tell me that?

39:47.553 --> 39:50.622
Well, I didn't think you'd be
going through my sock drawer.

39:50.656 --> 39:54.292
I wasn't <i>going</i> through your sock
drawer... because it's embarrassing.

39:54.327 --> 39:57.596
Okay? Six months ago
I was a Professor,

39:57.630 --> 40:01.667
and now I'm answering want ads
for webzines and...

40:01.702 --> 40:05.372
and reusing coffee filters.

40:14.582 --> 40:16.583
Can I join you?

40:33.334 --> 40:34.667
<i>When you're loyal</i>
<i>to a man, hewie,</i>

40:34.702 --> 40:37.570
<i>you're loyal to</i>
<i>everything about him...</i>

40:37.604 --> 40:40.406
<i>Even his faults...</i>

40:40.441 --> 40:42.409
<i>Even his son.</i>

40:48.383 --> 40:49.684
Good morning.

40:51.553 --> 40:52.720
Is it?

40:52.754 --> 40:55.590
I wanted to talk to you.

40:55.624 --> 40:59.593
Yeah. I figured you and mom
would want to have a chat.

40:59.628 --> 41:02.430
Your mom's already left.

41:02.464 --> 41:06.667
An important piece of evidence in the
Reynolds case was turned in last night.

41:06.702 --> 41:09.304
But I imagine
you already knew that.

41:13.509 --> 41:17.445
Now, Spence, the police have
been looking for that anklet

41:17.479 --> 41:19.314
for two years.

41:19.348 --> 41:21.749
I didn't know that.

41:21.783 --> 41:25.653
They didn't tell the family, and
they kept it out of the press.

41:25.687 --> 41:28.756
But you and Jason
managed to find it.

41:28.790 --> 41:32.492
I don't know how,
but there it is.

41:34.529 --> 41:37.664
The anklet had trace amounts
of blood still on it...

41:37.698 --> 41:40.434
Alison's and someone else's.

41:40.468 --> 41:43.770
That blood has been ruled out as
belonging to Garrett Reynolds.

41:43.804 --> 41:46.539
What... what do you mean?

41:46.574 --> 41:48.508
They don't know whose it is,

41:48.543 --> 41:53.346
but they know it's not his.

41:53.381 --> 41:54.714
That's... that's not possible.

41:54.749 --> 41:57.684
Spencer, the judge
threw out the case.

42:03.524 --> 42:05.425
I'll take you to school.

42:08.763 --> 42:11.599
Spencer?

42:16.405 --> 42:19.440
( Breathing heavily )

42:25.380 --> 42:27.514
( Muffled scream )

42:43.531 --> 42:45.466
( Crying )

42:51.773 --> 42:53.473
( Cellphone plinks )

43:34.324 --> 43:40.470
