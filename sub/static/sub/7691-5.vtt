15:41.866 --> 15:42.821
Oh.

15:44.035 --> 15:46.777
l gave you the book.
Don't you think you
ought to reciprocate?

15:46.871 --> 15:48.293
l'd love to. How?

15:49.307 --> 15:50.968
We could start
with a cup of coffee.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.497
Shh!

15:57.281 --> 15:58.987
That's a new one.

What is this?

16:13.831 --> 16:14.980
You're leaving town.

16:15.066 --> 16:16.021
What do you mean?

16:16.134 --> 16:17.874
Well, climate don't suit you,
you don't like your job,

16:17.969 --> 16:19.311
sick old aunt.
You pick the reason.

16:19.404 --> 16:20.792
Well, there must be
some kind of a mistake.

16:20.905 --> 16:22.850
No mistake, Beller,
you're messing
with the wrong girl.

16:22.974 --> 16:23.929
Pack a bag.

16:24.042 --> 16:25.111
l don't understand.

16:25.209 --> 16:28.076
You gonna come easy,
or you gonna give me
a hard time?

16:29.347 --> 16:31.417
Hard time don't
bother me one bit.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.941
This is the end
of the escort service.

16:57.041 --> 16:59.589
You keep going
in that direction.

17:00.211 --> 17:02.873
Man l work for thinks
you ought to have
a little traveling money.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.481
He's kind of generous.
lf it was left up to me,

17:04.615 --> 17:06.401
l'd give you the boot.

17:09.087 --> 17:10.748
He's only generous once.

17:12.390 --> 17:13.891
l don't want that.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.463
l could care less.
l'm only doing my job.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.821
This is because of Gale?

17:21.933 --> 17:24.878
Look, she don't exist
for you. You understand?

17:25.002 --> 17:26.821
l don't want this.
What happened to her?

17:26.938 --> 17:28.087
You forget her.
And stay away.

17:28.172 --> 17:31.562
l mean far away. Or else,
you're gonna get hurt.

David?

19:05.670 --> 19:08.059
Hi, there.
Where you headed?

19:08.172 --> 19:09.799
Doesn't matter.

19:09.907 --> 19:11.932
Well, you're
in luck, sport.

Ah, well, l don't blame
you for wanting
to leave Jordantown.

19:29.026 --> 19:32.655
No, siree, sport.
That's some tough
little burg, that one.

19:34.031 --> 19:35.419
People there don't know
the difference between

19:35.533 --> 19:38.115

and airplane parts.

19:39.503 --> 19:40.970
That's my business.

19:41.772 --> 19:44.923
Not the airplane parts.
Kitchen appliances.

19:46.043 --> 19:47.590
Yeah, those
lumberjacks back there,

19:47.712 --> 19:50.180
you'd think they
never ate a piece
of toast.

19:50.348 --> 19:53.897
l can't sell a toaster
in Jordantown to
save my life.

19:55.553 --> 19:58.818
About all l do
sell there are
those juicers.

19:58.923 --> 20:02.313
Yeah, they like
the old fresh-squeezed
in those hills.

20:02.426 --> 20:05.736
But they don't go in
for the frozen daiquiris.
No, siree...

20:08.666 --> 20:10.167
Okay.

20:12.136 --> 20:13.763
Come on, now.
lsn't that enough?

20:13.871 --> 20:15.611
Enough to make us
sick for days.

Let me get you
a really good one.

Oh, was that good.

Mmm-hmm.

20:34.992 --> 20:39.144
Ah, wasn't that nice?

20:55.913 --> 20:58.495
Oh, l've thought about
branching out, you know,

20:58.616 --> 21:01.403
getting into things
like vacuum cleaners,
and stuff.

21:01.519 --> 21:05.023
You'd be surprised, sport,
it's a whole other business.

21:05.122 --> 21:08.512
You wouldn't think it,
but this business is
really getting specialized.

21:08.626 --> 21:09.888
Just like medicine.

these days, huh?
Good luck!

pull over here, please?

21:17.601 --> 21:18.556

Would you mind pulling
over? l have to get out.

when you gotta go,
you gotta go?

Uh, no. Thank you.

from his apartment.

25:12.636 --> 25:15.378
All of his things
were gone,

25:15.472 --> 25:18.134
but there was food
cooking on the stove.

25:18.442 --> 25:20.069
l waited there
all night for him,

25:20.177 --> 25:22.281
and then l went to look
for him at work,
and he wasn't there either.

25:22.379 --> 25:24.119
This Beller is a drifter.

25:24.248 --> 25:26.910
l tried to tell you that,
Gale. But you wouldn't listen.

25:27.017 --> 25:29.565
Obviously, he got
what he wanted
and moved on.

25:29.687 --> 25:31.757
l know him.
He wouldn't do that.

25:33.557 --> 25:34.706
What are you saying?

25:34.825 --> 25:36.565
That you're a very
important man, Mr. Jordan.

25:36.660 --> 25:41.051
You didn't like my seeing
him and l think you had
something to do with this.

25:41.465 --> 25:43.285
You know, Gale,

25:43.400 --> 25:47.746
you haven't spent
much time in Jordantown
since you were a little girl.

25:48.706 --> 25:50.367
And now that your father
passed away...

25:50.474 --> 25:52.180
l don't see what all this
has to do with David.

25:52.276 --> 25:54.938
lt's just that l'm afraid
you might think there's
not much for you here.

25:55.045 --> 25:57.434
This could be your home.
l want you to understand that.

25:57.514 --> 26:01.143
There are people here
who care a great deal
about you.

26:01.251 --> 26:03.879
David cared about...
He cares about me.

26:06.256 --> 26:08.440
l don't want to
hurt you, Gale.

26:09.326 --> 26:12.033
l hoped l wouldn't
have to say this,

26:12.129 --> 26:16.520
but he wasn't
very interested
in you, not really.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.610
l thought maybe
l was wrong about David.

26:21.705 --> 26:24.014
So l put him to the test.

26:25.275 --> 26:28.745
l offered him
a few dollars
to leave town

26:29.146 --> 26:31.250
and he took it.
Gladly.

such an obvious mistake.

in my life like that?

on my tenants.

Well, it's not
my place to say.

wanted you to know, l
suppose she'd tell you.

A couple of guys
came and picked up
all her things.

28:23.627 --> 28:25.128
What did they say?

28:25.262 --> 28:26.809
Well, they said
she was going away,

28:26.930 --> 28:28.795
but she wanted
to keep the place.

28:28.899 --> 28:30.969
They had her key
and a note.

28:31.969 --> 28:35.678
They said they'd pay
the next month's rent
when it came due.

28:35.806 --> 28:37.148
And l doubt that.

28:37.241 --> 28:38.196
Why?

in her room.

28:42.146 --> 28:44.535
Just to see
if the lights were out.

28:45.516 --> 28:48.098

everything she had.

28:48.485 --> 28:50.476

all appearances.

railroad me,

making up a story
out of thin air.

to stick to the truth,

29:17.948 --> 29:20.018
why don't you try
to help me here?

29:20.384 --> 29:22.011
You're a reporter.
That means publicity.

29:22.119 --> 29:23.905
Mr. Jordan
don't like either.

29:24.054 --> 29:26.602
Think l'm gonna
risk my butt just so
you can get a story?

29:26.723 --> 29:30.511
You gonna get me
a job if l lose this one?
Sure you will. Sure.

29:30.861 --> 29:33.853
There's no reason
for you to lose
your job over this.

Well if Mr. Jordan says so,
l'll believe that.

29:37.034 --> 29:39.423

you see Mr. Jordan first.

Okay, now, who is this
Mr. Jordan?

29:43.073 --> 29:45.780
For a reporter,
you're real observant.
He owns the company.

29:45.876 --> 29:49.186
He owns the town,
he owns the valley.
l ain't biting the hand.

l've been threatened
because l've been
seeing her,

y0ur 0wn business.

30:17.107 --> 30:19.530
Officer, this is
my business.
She could be hurt.

30:19.643 --> 30:22.953
Don't worry about her.

ab0ut y0urself.

You'll put me
in the soup.

is going on?

just get out of here.

and you ain't welcome.

l was with

Gale Weber.
You know her, don't you?

30:55.078 --> 30:56.261
David, it don't matter.

30:56.380 --> 30:59.406
George, l need to
know what you know.
She's disappeared.

31:00.517 --> 31:03.065
Look, David, there's
a man who's crazy
about her.

31:03.153 --> 31:05.895
A man that you
don't mess with
in this town.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.536
She's probably
at his place.

31:07.658 --> 31:09.000
Who is he?

31:09.927 --> 31:11.394
Ellis Jordan.

31:11.728 --> 31:13.389
See, he's always
cared about her.

31:13.497 --> 31:16.921
lt's just that
in the last year or so,
since his wife died,

31:17.034 --> 31:19.377
he's gotten weird.

31:19.870 --> 31:22.612
He keeps to himself.
He hired bodyguards.

31:22.806 --> 31:25.195
And they don't mind
bustin' heads.

31:25.809 --> 31:27.276
There's nothing
you can do about it.

31:27.377 --> 31:29.959
There has to be!
He's kidnapped her
and he could hurt her.

31:30.080 --> 31:33.470
Look, Jordan owns this town
and damn near everyone in it.

31:33.583 --> 31:35.130
Police included.

31:37.988 --> 31:39.615
Forget it, David.

31:57.841 --> 32:00.344

there's a man wh0's
crazy ab0ut her.

32:00.444 --> 32:03.106
A man that y0u d0n't
mess with in this t0wn.

32:03.213 --> 32:05.283
She's pr0bably
at his place.

32:05.549 --> 32:06.971
There's n0thing

He's kidnapped her

32:09.319 --> 32:12.026
He's kidnapped her
and he c0uld hurt her.

32:16.226 --> 32:20.253
Would it scare you
terribly if l said l thought
l was falling in love?

32:21.264 --> 32:22.765
A little. Yeah.

32:25.135 --> 32:27.683
l know you told me
that you might have
to leave anytime.

32:27.804 --> 32:29.510
Not because of you.

32:32.309 --> 32:34.334
Well, then,
l'll tell you...

32:35.178 --> 32:36.918
l'm falling in love.

32:40.183 --> 32:41.684
So am l, Gale.

Can l help you?
Yeah, l'm a reporter,

34:17.214 --> 34:18.954
my name's
Jack McGee. l'm with
The Nati0nal Register.

34:19.049 --> 34:21.313
l'd like to speak
to Mr. Jordan.

34:22.385 --> 34:24.045
You're not on my list.
Do you have an appointment?

34:24.154 --> 34:27.862
No. No, l don't.
But it's very important
that l speak to him.

34:28.158 --> 34:30.058
Well, he generally doesn't
speak to reporters.

34:30.159 --> 34:34.233
Right, l understand that.
But would you just ask?
l came a long way for this.

34:37.100 --> 34:38.601
Well, let me see some lD.

34:38.702 --> 34:39.771
Sure.

35:01.091 --> 35:04.037
Well, l've checked
all the wiring.
l can't find the problem.

35:04.127 --> 35:06.027
lt has to be on the inside.
Where's the master bedroom?

35:06.129 --> 35:07.437
What?
The master bedroom.

35:07.531 --> 35:09.032
l have to check
the connections.
Ah.

35:09.132 --> 35:10.520
lt's on the
second floor.
Uh-huh.

35:10.634 --> 35:11.623
At the end
of the corridor.

35:11.735 --> 35:13.521
Thank you, thank you.

35:15.138 --> 35:17.208
That's what l thought.
Okay, yeah.

35:20.877 --> 35:23.869
l'm sorry, Mr. Jordan won't
speak to any reporters.

35:23.980 --> 35:25.720
Yeah, okay.
Would you...

35:25.815 --> 35:30.047
Would you tell him
that it's not Mr. Jordan
that l want to talk about?

35:30.453 --> 35:32.717
He doesn't wish
to be disturbed.

35:34.758 --> 35:38.148
Okay, fine. All right.
But l'm gonna wait here
until he does.

35:38.261 --> 35:40.923
That's up to you,
but this is
private property.

36:08.225 --> 36:10.045
Oh, David, thank God.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.787
Are you all right? Huh?

36:11.895 --> 36:14.284
l'm fine. He's only
holding me here.

36:14.397 --> 36:17.343
You should never have come.
He's absolutely crazy.
You've got to get out of here.

36:17.434 --> 36:18.696
No, we've got to
get out of here.

36:18.802 --> 36:19.757
There are guards.
lt's too risky.

36:19.869 --> 36:21.609
He's never gonna hurt me,
but if he sees
us together...

36:21.738 --> 36:22.727
Hold it!

36:22.839 --> 36:25.421
l got in and l can
get us out, all right?
Okay?

(GALE MOANS)

36:46.296 --> 36:48.036
Why did you come back?

36:50.634 --> 36:52.738
You think you're good
enough for her?

36:52.836 --> 36:55.384
l really don't think
that's the point.

36:56.206 --> 36:59.391
You have any idea who l am?
What l can do?

36:59.509 --> 37:02.501
Oh, yes.
Yes, l've seen
what you can do.

37:02.846 --> 37:04.996
But what l don't
understand is

37:05.081 --> 37:08.073
what you can gain
by kidnapping Gale.

37:14.557 --> 37:15.945
She's mine.

37:16.793 --> 37:18.863
l will not live
without her.

37:18.962 --> 37:20.304
Not anymore.

37:21.831 --> 37:23.059
Take him away.

37:26.202 --> 37:28.193
And do it right this time.

39:39.068 --> 39:40.490
You sure this is
the best way?

39:40.603 --> 39:42.628
The guy works here.
lt'll look like
an accident.

39:42.739 --> 39:44.286
l mean, maybe
we're goin' too far.

39:44.407 --> 39:45.988
Jordan didn't say
anything about this.

39:46.109 --> 39:47.849
He said, ''Do it right.''
Now, what do you think
he meant?

39:47.977 --> 39:49.797
lf this guy comes back,
we're gonna have to
pay for it.

39:49.913 --> 39:51.653
You wanna take that chance?

39:55.418 --> 39:56.760
All right.

39:58.188 --> 39:59.530
Hook me up.

40:59.616 --> 41:01.038
Get me another one.

That's all l want.

Do you honestly think
that you could mean
anything to me now?

My child.

44:42.038 --> 44:43.221
Please!

45:33.055 --> 45:35.080
Jordan was
already married

45:35.391 --> 45:38.019
when he became
involved with
my mother.

45:39.495 --> 45:41.599
My mother died
in childbirth,

45:42.698 --> 45:45.724
so he paid
the Webers to adopt me.

45:46.002 --> 45:46.957
Mmm-hmm.

45:47.470 --> 45:48.812
And then when
his wife died,

45:48.905 --> 45:51.408
he wanted to bring
me into his life.

45:52.775 --> 45:54.640
Why didn't he tell you?

45:55.645 --> 45:59.354
He must have felt
guilty for abandoning
me when l was a baby.

45:59.882 --> 46:01.747
But to do what he did...

46:01.884 --> 46:04.034
He didn't know
what else to do.

46:04.153 --> 46:05.939
He'd already
lost my mother.

46:06.055 --> 46:08.637
He must've been afraid
that he'd lose me, too.

46:09.926 --> 46:11.154
But everything
that's happened,

46:11.260 --> 46:13.444
it seems to have
changed him.

46:14.664 --> 46:17.610
l know that he'll let me
live my own life now.

46:19.235 --> 46:21.703
What're you gonna
do with that life?

46:22.805 --> 46:24.272
l don't know.

Um,

46:26.242 --> 46:28.824
l'm gonna stay
here for a little
while at least.

it wouldn't be
because of you.
