00:14.960 --> 00:16.440
I do.

00:17.560 --> 00:18.680
Sorry?

00:18.680 --> 00:22.200
You asked me if I wanted
fresh towels. I do, yeah.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.520
Oh, we do. Thanks.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.800
Would you get a move on?
All right!

00:34.560 --> 00:37.280
# Spring is here

00:37.280 --> 00:39.880
# The sky is blue... #

00:39.880 --> 00:41.560
Have you seen Mum?

00:41.560 --> 00:43.880
Well, weren't planning to.

00:43.880 --> 00:47.280
Not before the service.
I can't find my cuff-links.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.560
Are these them?

00:52.240 --> 00:53.760
Didn't look very hard, did you?

00:55.360 --> 00:57.640
# We're going

00:57.640 --> 00:59.640
# Going to the chapel

00:59.640 --> 01:01.960
# And we're gonna get married... #

01:01.960 --> 01:03.880
How do I look?

01:03.880 --> 01:06.160
Oh, Jen, you look beautiful.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.720
All eyes are gonna be on you.

01:07.720 --> 01:09.840
I don't want to upstage the bride...

01:09.840 --> 01:11.080
much.

01:11.080 --> 01:13.040
Well, then,
don't stand at the front.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.560
Oh, wowzer!

01:16.560 --> 01:17.840
You look amazing!

01:20.200 --> 01:23.080
# The bells will ring

01:23.080 --> 01:25.400
# The sun will shine... #

01:25.400 --> 01:26.800
The car's here.

01:27.880 --> 01:28.960
All right, good.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.960
Are you nervous?
A little.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.880
Well, quite a lot, actually.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.880
I just don't want to let her down.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.640
You won't, Dad.

01:37.640 --> 01:41.280
# And we'll never be lonely any more

01:41.280 --> 01:42.960
# Because we're

01:42.960 --> 01:45.600
# Going to the chapel

01:45.600 --> 01:49.040
# And we're gonna get married

01:49.040 --> 01:51.320
# We're going to the chapel

01:51.320 --> 01:54.840
# And we're gonna get married

01:54.840 --> 01:56.960
# Gee, I really love you

01:56.960 --> 02:00.080
# And we're gonna get married

02:00.080 --> 02:04.400
# We're going
to the chapel of love... #

02:27.280 --> 02:30.200
Here you go.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.240
Oh, thank you for give me away.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.080
It's my pleasure, Ramona.
Mm.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.400
Come on.

03:06.760 --> 03:10.640
Hey! Congratulations, Ramona.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.640
I like your husband - very dashing.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.640
Mm. He's a count.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.600
Oh... Well...
Well, why did you marry him, then?

03:17.600 --> 03:20.040
Hm?
Cos she wants to be a countess.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.560
Ah...

03:21.560 --> 03:24.080
I no care he's a count.
I care that he's nice to me.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.760
And good-looking.

03:25.760 --> 03:28.720
Good for you.
I had to settle for "nice to me".

03:30.520 --> 03:32.560
Which is more than I got.
Hey!

03:32.560 --> 03:34.440
Hey, er, Ramona...
Mm-hm?

03:34.440 --> 03:36.240
Who's the, er, woman in the orange?

03:37.600 --> 03:38.840
Aha.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.320
Alejandro's niece, Isabella.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.720
I think she likes me.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.080
You speak Spanish?
Cos she have no English.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.960
No, we're speaking
the universal language.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.600
Oh, Esperanto?

03:48.600 --> 03:50.120
Sexual attraction.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.640
Oh!

03:56.360 --> 03:57.600
Bon dias.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.160
Hola!

04:05.480 --> 04:07.000
So, how are you finding university?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.560
Oh, I am loving it.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.600
I meant Adam.
Hey?

04:11.600 --> 04:13.320
Oh, yeah, yeah. He's loving it, too.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.960
My lecturer, oh, he's so inspiring.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.760
He's like that...
Sorry.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.560
..Robin Williams
in Dead Poets Society.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.360
You're doing really well,
aren't you, son?

04:21.360 --> 04:22.560
I'm doing all right.
Yeah.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.560
So's Josh. Of course,
I wouldn't expect anything else.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.520
Well, we did, to be honest.

04:27.520 --> 04:30.720
Yeah, but he didn't go to one of
them posh schools like Josh, did he?

04:30.720 --> 04:33.560
No, no. We definitely
gave him the best start.

04:33.560 --> 04:37.360
That was your ex-wife on the phone.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.840
Robin is handling Nikki's divorce
from George.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.720
Oh, he's got a bob or two!
Not two any more.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.080
My settlement's just come through.
Oh!

04:45.080 --> 04:47.360
So, that's two men I know
who've suffered at her hands.

04:47.360 --> 04:48.360
Thank you.

04:49.560 --> 04:52.600
Congratulations. Here's to your
sudden wealth. How does it feel?

04:52.600 --> 04:53.920
Well, it's a relief,

04:53.920 --> 04:56.040
cos we've had to live
on a budget the past few months.

04:56.040 --> 04:59.000
I still do.
My circumstances haven't changed.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.840
You better raise your game
if you wanna keep up with that one.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.680
Hey, Alejandro bring me here
on our first date.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.880
So, er, three months ago?

05:16.320 --> 05:18.960
Look, when you know is right,
it's no matter.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.520
You know.
Yeah.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.560
It's a shame you no bring Gavin.
Gareth.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.880
Oh!
We split up months ago, Ramona.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.640
I sent you a long e-mail.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.200
Oh, yeah, sorry. I've been busy.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.640
Mm.
So, we find you someone new.

05:33.640 --> 05:36.200
Not interested. Hm,
you don't want to grow old alone.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.840
Well, I'm doing all right so far,
thanks.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.360
Oh, Karen, you will find someone.
I don't need to.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.960
And perhaps, hm...

05:43.960 --> 05:46.200
he's here, hm?

05:47.840 --> 05:48.960
Ah!

05:57.560 --> 05:59.320
Yo.
Hey.

06:01.080 --> 06:04.640
So, what do you think of Alejandro?
I just hope he makes Ramona happy.

06:04.640 --> 06:05.840
Don't see why he wouldn't.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.160
He's charming,
he's good-looking, he's rich.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.280
He's charming,
Mm... Not sure I trust him.

06:11.560 --> 06:14.480
Maybe that says more about you
than him. Probably.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.720
Shouldn't you be talking
to that Isabella?

06:17.720 --> 06:20.280
I thought you two were speaking
"the universal language".

06:21.400 --> 06:23.560
Something got lost in translation.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.720
Oh, you're from Valencia!

06:25.720 --> 06:28.040
No, never been there.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.400
I went to Madrid once...
to see United play.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.200
They've got loads
of Spanish players.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.840
Er, De Gea, Mata...

06:34.840 --> 06:37.600
Herrera. They've even
got one called Valencia.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.680
But he's from Ecuador.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.240
El es mi amigo.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.640
Disculpa.

06:45.640 --> 06:46.640
What?

06:48.200 --> 06:50.360
'We didn't share the same interests.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.240
'You know, football, me.'

06:52.240 --> 06:53.760
Oh...

06:57.680 --> 06:59.040
I'd like to say a couple of words.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.440
Josh...

07:01.440 --> 07:03.920
Will you act as my interpreter?
Me?

07:03.920 --> 07:06.520
Yeah, well, you're studying Spanish.

07:06.520 --> 07:09.120
Could I have some attention, please?

07:11.280 --> 07:12.280
Silencio!

07:14.480 --> 07:16.160
Thank you, Josh.

07:16.160 --> 07:20.280
Erm, now, Ramona was for many years
our children's nanny.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.560
Ninera!
Ninera.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.920
Ninera...

07:39.920 --> 07:44.120
And it was a great honour to be
asked to stand in for her father.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.800
Dad, I can't do this.
It's perfectly simple.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.520
No, I hate public speaking.

07:47.520 --> 07:50.320
Well, I'm doing that.
You just have to translate.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.200
It was a great honour...

08:06.040 --> 08:07.920
I always remember when...

08:12.320 --> 08:13.400
David!

08:18.040 --> 08:19.160
I hadn't quite finished.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.280
Look, they knew
what you wanted to say.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.360
# Senora

08:24.600 --> 08:26.280
# No se pense resistir... #

08:34.640 --> 08:36.159
Right, there you go.

08:36.159 --> 08:38.120
Wow.
Who-o-oa!

08:38.120 --> 08:40.600
What do you think, eh?
Oh, Pete...!

08:40.600 --> 08:41.799
Oi!

08:44.280 --> 08:45.400
Where are you two going?

08:45.400 --> 08:47.280
We're going for a spin
in Alejandro's car.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.600
Ramona's lent me the keys.
Oh, nice. Can I come?

08:49.600 --> 08:51.600
Ramona's lent me the keys.
Erm... Yeah, it's a two-seater.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.680
Anyway, I thought you were
hitting on all the senoritas.

08:54.680 --> 08:56.120
Yeah, just a couple.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.880
Not much luck.
I think it's my accent.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.040
Mm. Oh, come on,
don't leave me on my own.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.840
Come on, I can squeeze in the back.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.200
Hm...
Yeah.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.960
I mean, we could do.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.840
But then again...

09:08.840 --> 09:11.480
you and me, the open road...

09:11.480 --> 09:14.480
find ourselves
a cosy little country lane.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.080
Just saying.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.360
Right!

09:21.320 --> 09:23.480
See you later, navigator.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.280
Er...

09:42.920 --> 09:44.900
Oh, come on!

09:45.067 --> 09:46.787
Don't be so hard on yourself.

09:48.747 --> 09:50.987
Simultaneous translation's
really difficult.

09:54.147 --> 09:56.427
Here you go, Mum.
Aw, thanks.

09:57.507 --> 09:59.347
Thanks, darling.

10:01.907 --> 10:03.707
There's something
I need to tell you,

10:03.707 --> 10:05.547
but I'm worried
you're gonna take it badly.

10:05.547 --> 10:07.947
Oh, God...

10:07.947 --> 10:10.427
Well, come on, then.
You've never shocked me before.

10:10.427 --> 10:12.067
What have you got?

10:12.067 --> 10:13.827
I've dropped out of uni.

10:16.747 --> 10:19.227
Well, it happens.

10:19.227 --> 10:20.907
Oh, Mum...!

10:20.907 --> 10:22.467
Oh, come on!

10:22.467 --> 10:24.627
It's not the end of the world,
sweetheart.

10:24.627 --> 10:28.467
And when we leave here, you just
come home with me and the girls.

10:28.467 --> 10:29.547
And what about Dad?

10:33.387 --> 10:36.027
Probably best
we don't say anything to him yet.

10:36.027 --> 10:38.307
Not till we know
what you're gonna do.

10:39.787 --> 10:41.987
Now, look,
are we going to sit here and mope

10:41.987 --> 10:44.427
or am I going to put you to shame
on the dance floor? Come on!

10:51.747 --> 10:54.387
# Oh, baby, when you talk like that

10:54.387 --> 10:56.667
# You make a woman go mad

10:56.667 --> 10:58.907
# So be wise and keep on

10:58.907 --> 11:02.027
# Reading the signs of my body... #

11:02.027 --> 11:04.107
Hi!
I thought you'd be longer.

11:04.107 --> 11:05.347
Well, we would've been.

11:05.347 --> 11:07.547
Yeah,
except we got stopped by the police.

11:07.547 --> 11:09.867
Speeding?
Hmm...

11:09.867 --> 11:12.067
Speeding?
Maybe parked up in a lay-by.

11:12.067 --> 11:13.747
Yeah, they gave us
a hell of a start.

11:13.747 --> 11:15.067
Yeah, I felt that!

11:16.187 --> 11:18.107
Are you having a good time?
Oh, yeah, brilliant.

11:18.107 --> 11:21.027
I can't even get drunk.
No free hands.

11:23.787 --> 11:25.707
Did you ever think
life might be passing you by?

11:25.707 --> 11:27.867
Hey?
No.

11:27.867 --> 11:29.467
Slow dance, come on. Come on.

11:29.467 --> 11:31.227
Come on, love.
Aw...

11:31.227 --> 11:33.747
We can't leave him on his own again.

11:33.747 --> 11:37.147
No, look at him. He's got his hands
full with all his new friends.

11:37.147 --> 11:38.307
Very good.

11:38.307 --> 11:40.347
You said you wanted to be a hit
with the senoritas.

11:40.347 --> 11:42.187
Well, look at you now!

11:55.817 --> 11:58.457
# When I'm lyin' in my bed at night

11:58.457 --> 11:59.937
# I don't wanna grow up... #

12:02.177 --> 12:04.337
Dad?
I'm in the bathroom.

12:06.817 --> 12:08.657
Hey, that wasn't an invitation
to join me.

12:08.657 --> 12:11.057
I'm in a hurry.

12:11.390 --> 12:13.030
Well, what do you do that for?

12:13.764 --> 12:16.444
Oh, no, it's, erm...
plant food for hair.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.364
You know, it gives it extra body.

12:18.364 --> 12:20.924
Does it get rid of the grey as well?
Oh, get out of it.

12:22.924 --> 12:24.644
What do you want?
Wax.

12:24.644 --> 12:27.004
Oh, so you can use product,
but I can't? Mm-hm.

12:28.364 --> 12:31.964
Who's your date?
Need-to-know basis.

12:31.964 --> 12:34.244
Dad, can I have 20 quid?
Jeez...

12:35.684 --> 12:38.164
Call it an advance
on your inheritance.

12:38.164 --> 12:39.524
Ta.

12:39.524 --> 12:42.164
Don't leave it on too long. You
don't want to give it too much body!

12:45.764 --> 12:47.084
Oh, shite!

12:49.324 --> 12:50.844
Stay with me, Barbara.

12:50.844 --> 12:52.204
The ambulance is on its way.

12:53.404 --> 12:54.844
Keep it down, will ya?

12:54.844 --> 12:57.444
I'm trying to finish an assignment.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.044
By rights, I should be singing,
but you objected to that, too.

13:00.044 --> 13:02.604
Well, you were flat.
Why are you doing it anyway?

13:02.604 --> 13:05.684
He has to practise.
He might have to do it one day.

13:05.684 --> 13:07.684
Well, shouldn't it be
second nature by now?

13:07.684 --> 13:10.084
Well, yeah,
but I've never done it for real,

13:10.084 --> 13:12.444
and I'm worried that when I have to,
I'll just... freeze.

13:12.444 --> 13:15.284
Oh, I know what you mean.
It's like whenever I'm on a plane,

13:15.284 --> 13:18.164
the emergency drill,
I never take it in.

13:18.164 --> 13:20.124
When were you last on a plane?

13:20.124 --> 13:22.204
Well, you can never get
too much practice, Barb.

13:25.324 --> 13:27.524
Oooh...
Do it in the other room, will you?

13:27.524 --> 13:29.004
Grumpy, eh?

13:29.004 --> 13:31.364
Quietly! Oh, all right.
We'll go the other room.

13:31.364 --> 13:33.244
Are you going to give me
mouth-to-mouth as well?

13:33.244 --> 13:35.084
Have you got your dentures in?

13:35.084 --> 13:36.284
Oh!

13:36.284 --> 13:37.724
You better hope so!

13:48.844 --> 13:50.164
Hey...

13:50.164 --> 13:52.284
It's my favourite customer.

13:55.324 --> 13:57.804
Very good. Adam, isn't it?

13:57.804 --> 14:00.444
Yeah.
Never forget a handsome face.

14:00.444 --> 14:01.844
Oh, I'm the same.

14:01.844 --> 14:05.164
Gemma...
The usual?

14:05.164 --> 14:07.044
Er, to have here, yeah.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.724
I'll bring it over.

14:13.724 --> 14:15.044
Thanks.

14:23.164 --> 14:25.244
David! I wasn't expecting you.

14:25.244 --> 14:26.444
Hi.

14:26.444 --> 14:28.484
I hoped you might be free
for coffee. No, I'm not.

14:28.484 --> 14:30.364
Oh, well. This won't take long.

14:32.124 --> 14:34.004
'You want to take money
out of the company?'

14:34.004 --> 14:36.044
Er, as a dividend, yes.

14:36.044 --> 14:37.924
No, I'm not sure
now's the right time, David.

14:37.924 --> 14:40.604
I've just given a sizeable advance
to a first-time author from Hull.

14:40.604 --> 14:42.484
Did you have to?

14:42.484 --> 14:43.844
I mean, Hull?

14:45.084 --> 14:47.724
Are you short of money, David?
No!

14:47.724 --> 14:49.324
No. No.

14:49.324 --> 14:52.084
I mean, I have overheads,
obviously, like you do.

14:52.084 --> 14:54.764
The girls' school fees,
university tuition for Josh...

14:54.764 --> 14:58.284
Mm... Er, I might need
to talk to you about that. Mum?

14:58.284 --> 14:59.324
Josh?

15:01.404 --> 15:03.844
Ah...
Dad.

15:03.844 --> 15:05.244
I thought you'd be at university.

15:07.244 --> 15:10.564
Josh is just spending a few days
at home... to consider his future.

15:10.564 --> 15:13.124
Oh, you don't graduate for
another year. What's to consider?

15:14.284 --> 15:18.524
W-Well, that's the thing.
Erm... I'm not going to graduate.

15:18.524 --> 15:21.164
Of course you are. Nowadays, you
only have to turn up to the exams,

15:21.164 --> 15:22.484
they give you a 2:1.
No...

15:23.564 --> 15:24.724
I've dropped out.

15:25.884 --> 15:30.604
He hasn't dropped out formally.
He's just stopped going.

15:30.604 --> 15:33.124
Why?
I'm not happy, Dad.

15:33.124 --> 15:35.444
Happy? Who cares about happy?

15:35.444 --> 15:37.444
You go to university
to get a degree.

15:37.444 --> 15:40.164
I'm no good at Spanish.
You saw that for yourself.

15:40.164 --> 15:42.564
And I hate business studies.
I only did it to please you.

15:42.564 --> 15:44.244
So dropping out's
gonna make me proud?

15:44.244 --> 15:47.364
David, he hasn't dropped out!
Pete's Adam is doing very well.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.724
Straight A's.
And he went to a comprehensive.

15:51.164 --> 15:53.364
So, how many lectures
have you missed? Three.

15:53.364 --> 15:55.564
Ah...
Months.

15:55.564 --> 15:57.524
Months?!
Josh, you told me a few weeks!

15:57.524 --> 15:59.124
That is a few weeks.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.804
So, all this time I've been paying
and you haven't even been there?

16:01.804 --> 16:03.404
I knew it would be about the money.

16:03.404 --> 16:05.444
David, money's
not the most important thing.

16:05.444 --> 16:07.764
It's important to me.
I'll pay you back.

16:07.764 --> 16:09.004
How, without an education?

16:09.004 --> 16:11.524
See, I told you there was
no point in talking to him!

16:11.524 --> 16:13.404
Josh...
Josh, don't walk away from me!

16:13.404 --> 16:15.004
David, let me handle this!

16:15.004 --> 16:17.124
I want you back at university
by the weekend!

16:19.244 --> 16:22.364
Sort this out, Karen.

16:31.044 --> 16:32.924
She's all right.

16:34.004 --> 16:35.804
What? We all do it.

16:35.804 --> 16:37.324
Online dating?

16:37.324 --> 16:39.404
I'm sure you don't need to.
Why, thank you!

16:39.404 --> 16:40.604
I could say the same.

16:40.604 --> 16:43.204
Oh, no, at my age, it's...
it's hard to meet new people.

16:43.204 --> 16:45.764
You can't be more than, what...

16:45.764 --> 16:48.324
40... two?

16:48.324 --> 16:51.284
Close enough.
You must get lots of matches.

16:51.284 --> 16:53.644
Mm.
I've seen what's out there.

16:53.644 --> 16:56.084
Oh! She gives with one hand,
takes with the other.

16:56.084 --> 16:59.324
I'm serious. If I was
in the market for a 42-year-old

16:59.324 --> 17:01.684
with come-to-bed eyes,
I'd swipe right.

17:04.324 --> 17:07.324
Well, you know, if, erm, you are...

17:07.324 --> 17:08.884
you know where to find me.

17:10.044 --> 17:12.763
Don't let your coffee go cold.
OK.

17:19.723 --> 17:21.844
I was a disappointment
to my father.

17:23.044 --> 17:24.564
You don't talk about him much.

17:24.564 --> 17:26.284
No. I hated the man.

17:27.404 --> 17:30.444
God, he'd be spinning in his grave
if he could see me now.

17:30.444 --> 17:32.124
Thank you, David.

17:32.124 --> 17:33.964
Oh, I don't mean you, darling.

17:33.964 --> 17:39.284
I mean, living beyond my means
and earning on commission.

17:39.284 --> 17:40.964
There's no shame
to working in insurance.

17:40.964 --> 17:42.484
That's what I tell people I do.

17:42.484 --> 17:45.244
We both know
it's basically a call centre.

17:45.244 --> 17:48.524
Yeah, true, if they hadn't been
driving a Maserati,

17:48.524 --> 17:50.644
the repair bill
wouldn't have been so high.

17:50.644 --> 17:52.844
But then,
if you hadn't driven into them,

17:52.844 --> 17:54.444
there wouldn't be
a repair bill at all.

17:54.444 --> 17:57.764
Yeah, and a very good afternoon
to you, ma...

17:57.764 --> 17:59.324
Another satisfied customer?

17:59.324 --> 18:02.044
It's difficult to tell.
She put the phone down on me.

18:03.364 --> 18:05.684
Is Donna all right?

18:05.684 --> 18:08.004
Well, she's pregnant and on her own,
so...

18:08.004 --> 18:10.004
Val, who's answering your phone?!

18:12.044 --> 18:14.524
I'm telling people their bonuses.

18:14.524 --> 18:16.364
Ah...

18:16.364 --> 18:19.804
Well, that explains
the air of incipient despondency.

18:19.804 --> 18:21.884
"Incipient despondency"?

18:21.884 --> 18:23.524
You crack me up, David!

18:23.524 --> 18:26.604
Thanks. So, bonus...

18:28.124 --> 18:29.684
So, what am I getting?

18:29.684 --> 18:31.524
Nothing.

18:31.524 --> 18:33.804
I wanted to tell you in person.

18:33.804 --> 18:35.724
Now, crack on.

18:37.924 --> 18:40.444
'If you hate it so much,
find something else.'

18:40.444 --> 18:42.884
How?
We're barely allowed a toilet break.

18:42.884 --> 18:45.084
I can't see them
giving me time off for an interview.

18:45.084 --> 18:46.644
Well, then, quit.
I can't afford to!

18:46.644 --> 18:48.364
Well...

18:48.364 --> 18:49.884
No, but I can.

18:49.884 --> 18:53.044
I can give you money
till you're back on your feet.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.404
What, live off charity?

18:55.564 --> 18:57.044
God, Dad would love that.

18:57.044 --> 18:59.884
I thought he was dead.
He is.

18:59.884 --> 19:01.964
Technically.

19:10.244 --> 19:11.564
How do I look?

19:13.444 --> 19:14.644
Older.

19:15.844 --> 19:17.964
Unlike you.
Is that my jacket?

19:19.444 --> 19:20.924
Do you mind?
No.

19:20.924 --> 19:22.844
God, I'm delighted
you think I'm stylish.

19:22.844 --> 19:24.964
Well,
you work for a fashion website.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.644
You'd hope something rubbed off.
In IT.

19:27.644 --> 19:30.084
I don't tell people that bit.
I'll see you later.

19:30.084 --> 19:32.124
Hey, wait, whoa, whoa!

19:32.124 --> 19:33.764
You said you were in tonight.

19:33.764 --> 19:35.604
Yeah, the plans have changed.

19:35.604 --> 19:37.604
Oh, I thought we'd watch Netflix
and chill.

19:38.804 --> 19:41.324
You can do that on your own.
That's not as much fun, though, eh?

19:41.324 --> 19:44.484
See ya.
Oh, right, yeah.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.324
Your new girlfriend.

19:46.324 --> 19:48.044
When am I going to meet her?

19:48.044 --> 19:50.324
Here, invite her over for dinner.
Dad...

19:52.484 --> 19:54.044
Am I that embarrassing?

19:56.244 --> 19:57.284
OK, sure.

19:57.284 --> 19:59.564
I've gotta go.
All right, have fun.

20:05.804 --> 20:07.764
Do you think these boys look bigger?

20:07.764 --> 20:11.244
Bigger than what?
Than they used to.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.364
Hm, maybe a little lower.

20:17.324 --> 20:19.644
Do you think it's a menopause thing?
What, bigger boobs?

20:20.764 --> 20:22.964
Why don't you google it?

20:22.964 --> 20:24.684
I don't want that
on my search history.

20:24.684 --> 20:27.604
It's already on mine.
I'm sure it is.

20:27.604 --> 20:29.364
And why would you think that anyway?

20:29.364 --> 20:32.244
You what?
A sign of the menopause.

20:32.244 --> 20:33.844
I don't know. It could be.

20:33.844 --> 20:37.364
I feel really hot when I'm in bed.
No, that's just this duvet.

20:37.364 --> 20:38.644
Too many togs.

20:38.644 --> 20:40.284
Plus my period's late.

20:40.284 --> 20:42.964
Well, I did wonder,
but I didn't want to say anything.

20:42.964 --> 20:45.004
Hm. That's a first.

20:48.564 --> 20:51.364
Maybe you're pregnant.
Hm! Don't be daft.

21:00.444 --> 21:02.884
No! Wait... Wait, Jen.

21:02.884 --> 21:04.604
Jen, yes, that's it.

21:04.604 --> 21:06.284
Your period's late.
You're never late.

21:06.284 --> 21:08.964
We can set the calendar by you.
Pete, I'm 50.

21:08.964 --> 21:12.084
No, it could happen to women
at your age. It's not inconceivable.

21:12.084 --> 21:13.644
See what I did there?

21:13.644 --> 21:14.804
I'm not pregnant.

21:14.804 --> 21:18.444
Ah, we had great sex
at Ramona's wedding.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.844
Unprotected!
It'll be the menopause.

21:20.844 --> 21:23.484
Your boobs swelled up
when you were pregnant with Chloe.

21:23.484 --> 21:25.324
To be fair, all of me swelled up.

21:25.324 --> 21:26.804
Look, trust me!

21:26.804 --> 21:29.204
You are up the duff.
I know these things.

21:29.204 --> 21:32.084
When you were expecting Adam,
I knew before you did, didn't I?

21:32.084 --> 21:35.164
Yeah, that's true.
Yeah. Go to sleep.

21:35.164 --> 21:37.364
See, I'm not surprised.

21:37.364 --> 21:40.924
Since we renewed our wedding vows,
we've been getting on so well. Mm.

21:46.124 --> 21:47.844
This is the cherry...

21:47.844 --> 21:49.524
on the icing...

21:49.524 --> 21:51.044
on the cake.

21:52.324 --> 21:53.484
Yes!

22:01.574 --> 22:03.574
It's good to get out.

22:03.574 --> 22:05.894
Yeah, well, you're a free agent.
You've got no excuse.

22:05.894 --> 22:06.934
Yeah, well, you're a free agent.
Yeah.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.294
Well, I've got some news.
What's happened to your hair?

22:10.294 --> 22:12.134
I left the dye on too long.
It's Matt's fault.

22:12.134 --> 22:14.974
Probably best not to say anything.
Is it noticeable?

22:14.974 --> 22:16.334
No, no, no.

22:16.334 --> 22:17.814
At least not until it's confirmed.

22:17.814 --> 22:19.334
Are you listening to me?

22:19.334 --> 22:22.134
Well, it must be, otherwise
you wouldn't have said anything.

22:22.134 --> 22:23.614
Jenny's pregnant.

22:25.134 --> 22:27.134
Right, you got our attention.
What's your news?

22:27.134 --> 22:29.814
No, that's it. Jenny's pregnant.
Oh, bollocks!

22:29.814 --> 22:31.054
She's too old, surely.

22:31.054 --> 22:32.854
Well, she's not
been through the change.

22:32.854 --> 22:34.974
Yeah, you don't look at her
and think "fecund".

22:36.214 --> 22:38.414
Well, if that means
what I think it means,

22:38.414 --> 22:40.374
I'll have you know
I find her very fecund.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.934
Are you sure?
Well, you know, sometimes.

22:43.934 --> 22:45.974
Once a month.
No, that she's pregnant.

22:45.974 --> 22:48.454
Well, not 100%.
But all the signs are there.

22:48.454 --> 22:51.334
What, like a positive
pregnancy test? Hm.

22:51.334 --> 22:53.734
I don't need to do a test.
You know your own body, don't you?

22:53.734 --> 22:54.934
Yeah, you do.

22:54.934 --> 22:57.294
Mind you, I did think,
if it'd shut Pete up...

22:57.294 --> 23:00.134
and I happened to be
in the chemist's anyway.

23:01.414 --> 23:05.654
'Got to admit,
I felt slightly embarrassed

23:05.654 --> 23:08.014
'shopping for a pregnancy test
at 50.'

23:08.014 --> 23:10.574
It feels a little bit like
buying your condoms when you're 15.

23:10.574 --> 23:13.174
Did you? 15?

23:13.174 --> 23:15.574
Yeah, had to.
Pete was always too shy.

23:16.894 --> 23:18.574
Bless. Anyhow...

23:18.574 --> 23:20.334
'I found one.

23:20.334 --> 23:24.054
'But then I saw this mum
of one of Chloe's friends.

23:24.054 --> 23:25.414
'I panicked.'

23:26.734 --> 23:27.934
Hi, Jen.

23:27.934 --> 23:30.414
Hi...!

23:35.054 --> 23:38.334
It's not that she might think I'm
pregnant, she might think Chloe is!

23:38.334 --> 23:40.374
Well, suppose you are?
Oh, God, I'm not.

23:40.374 --> 23:42.094
Would you go through with it?

23:42.094 --> 23:43.694
Ohh... Would you?

23:43.694 --> 23:46.294
God, no.
No, value my sleep too much.

23:46.294 --> 23:49.174
Hm... And I'd have to give up work.
Wouldn't have the time.

23:49.174 --> 23:51.254
Or the mental capacity, frankly.

23:51.254 --> 23:53.814
I'd have to give up my course.
I mean, I couldn't do that.

23:53.814 --> 23:56.774
But, I mean, an abortion.
I mean, I couldn't do that either.

23:56.774 --> 23:58.854
Well, hopefully it's the menopause.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.014
Yay!

24:00.014 --> 24:01.294
Yay

24:01.294 --> 24:02.894
Menopause!

24:02.894 --> 24:04.814
Oh, rubbish!
Yeah...

24:04.814 --> 24:07.734
Look, we'll know soon enough. I've
got an appointment at the clinic.

24:07.734 --> 24:09.574
Put Pete out of his misery.

24:09.574 --> 24:12.654
He is carrying on
like an expectant dad.

24:12.654 --> 24:15.494
I've made him promise
that he will not tell the lads.

24:16.734 --> 24:19.574
And I know when it happened, too. It
was the night of Ramona's wedding.

24:19.574 --> 24:21.294
Well, how can you be so sure?

24:21.294 --> 24:23.414
Oh, yeah, just once a month.

24:23.414 --> 24:25.814
I thought you were disturbed
by the police. We were.

24:25.814 --> 24:29.254
If anything, the shock gave me
that little bit more thrust.

24:30.814 --> 24:32.174
Come to think of it...

24:32.174 --> 24:34.734
that is what probably caused it.

24:34.734 --> 24:35.734
Shut up.

24:43.414 --> 24:45.414
Mrs Gifford. What can I do for you?

24:45.414 --> 24:46.814
Settle a bet.

24:46.814 --> 24:49.214
My husband's got a fiver
on me being pregnant.

24:49.214 --> 24:51.694
Right.
Well, let's take a look at you.

24:51.694 --> 24:54.214
Smart money says it's the change.

24:59.174 --> 25:00.574
I need a girlfriend.

25:00.574 --> 25:02.014
Getting sick of my own company.

25:02.014 --> 25:04.334
Problem is...
they get sick of it, too.

25:04.334 --> 25:06.174
Ramona's wedding.

25:06.174 --> 25:10.574
That was a bad night. I began
to think I might be losing my touch.

25:10.574 --> 25:13.374
What makes you think you're not?
I have an admirer.

25:13.374 --> 25:15.374
She's very attractive.

25:15.374 --> 25:17.974
She's a barista
at this cafe I go to.

25:26.334 --> 25:29.174
Hey! It's my favourite customer.

25:29.174 --> 25:31.374
They live for tips.
No, no, no.

25:31.374 --> 25:33.014
She's made it clear
that she likes me.

25:33.014 --> 25:34.614
I'd swipe right.

25:40.814 --> 25:44.014
That means nothing.
Baristas often draw a love heart.

25:44.014 --> 25:48.014
Not with a Cupid's arrow through it.

25:51.494 --> 25:53.694
Well, I'm relieved I'm not pregnant,

25:53.694 --> 25:56.094
but I'm not sure why
you're still touching my boobs.

25:56.094 --> 25:57.934
You can get dressed now.

25:57.934 --> 26:00.814
It's because you mentioned
one was feeling larger.

26:00.814 --> 26:04.174
Oh, yeah?
Is that a menopause thing, then?

26:04.174 --> 26:06.494
Not usually.
What was it, then?

26:06.494 --> 26:07.894
Not usually.
Professional curiosity?

26:07.894 --> 26:10.254
It can be a symptom
of something else.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.734
Well, I... I've put on
a couple of pounds, to be honest.

26:18.734 --> 26:20.014
I felt a lump.

26:21.294 --> 26:24.334
I'd like to refer you
to the hospital for tests.

26:25.454 --> 26:28.014
Is it cancer?
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

26:28.014 --> 26:29.534
It might be nothing.

26:29.534 --> 26:31.654
Yeah, but it-it might be cancer.

26:38.934 --> 26:42.294
So, this barista that's got
the hots for you, how old is she?

26:42.294 --> 26:44.334
She's 27.
Oh.

26:44.334 --> 26:46.094
I checked her dating profile.

26:46.094 --> 26:48.934
That's way too young,
even by your standards.

26:48.934 --> 26:51.454
The gap's 15 years.
It doesn't seem to bother her.

26:53.174 --> 26:54.854
15?!

26:54.854 --> 26:57.654
Yeah. She thinks I'm 42.

26:57.654 --> 26:59.494
Yeah, but you're not.

26:59.494 --> 27:00.934
You're clearly deluded, mate.

27:00.934 --> 27:02.854
You're losing your mind
as well as your looks.

27:02.854 --> 27:04.454
Someone's in the canal!

27:07.014 --> 27:08.934
It must be bloody freezing!
Bloody hell!

27:10.294 --> 27:11.534
Hey!
Oi!

27:11.534 --> 27:12.934
Hang on!

27:15.734 --> 27:17.094
We're coming!

27:17.094 --> 27:18.414
It's OK.

27:18.414 --> 27:19.814
Oh, barrel, barrel.

27:19.814 --> 27:22.254
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good idea!

27:24.214 --> 27:26.134
Bloody hell, you nearly brained him!

27:26.134 --> 27:27.814
Well, what are we going to do?!

27:27.814 --> 27:30.334
We've gotta do something.
Well, one of us has got to get in.

27:30.334 --> 27:31.974
What?
Wha-wha-what...?

27:31.974 --> 27:33.374
It's my best suit.

27:35.614 --> 27:38.014
Oh, for God's sake!

27:38.014 --> 27:39.774
Grab that!
He's coming! He's coming!

27:39.774 --> 27:41.334
Good man. Come on.

27:41.334 --> 27:44.134
Come on, there you go.
There you go, son.

27:44.134 --> 27:46.614
He's coming! He's coming!

27:46.614 --> 27:47.934
Ambulance, please.

27:47.934 --> 27:50.534
That's it, Pete. Come on.
That's it, that's it. Come on.

27:50.534 --> 27:51.854
Castlefield.

27:51.854 --> 27:54.214
Near the white,
bendy, wobbly bridge.

27:54.214 --> 27:55.934
Lift his head out!
Lift his head out!

27:55.934 --> 27:57.614
That's it. Keep going. Keep going.

27:57.614 --> 28:00.574
You've just got to get people,
experts needed now. Please, now.

28:00.907 --> 28:02.867
Almost there.

28:02.867 --> 28:04.627
Come on! Give me your hand!

28:04.627 --> 28:05.707
That's it.

28:05.707 --> 28:07.867
My two friends
are looking after him.

28:07.867 --> 28:09.467
No, both totally inadequate.

28:09.467 --> 28:11.467
Oh, God. Oh... Oh, no!

28:12.987 --> 28:14.387
He's unconscious!

28:14.387 --> 28:15.667
Can you do CPR?

28:15.667 --> 28:17.507
Well, like,
I've done a bit in the care home.

28:17.507 --> 28:19.067
Come on, he's turning blue!

28:19.067 --> 28:20.867
Oh, God. I need the song!

28:20.867 --> 28:22.667
What?
Give me a song by the Bee Gees!

28:22.667 --> 28:25.347
What?!
Give me a song by the Bee Gees!

28:25.347 --> 28:27.427
Er, How Deep Is Your Love?
No, not that one!

28:27.427 --> 28:29.027
Er, Night Fever?
No, not that!

28:29.027 --> 28:30.507
Stayin' Alive?
That's it!

28:30.507 --> 28:32.387
Sing it.
Why? I need the rhythm!

28:32.387 --> 28:33.467
Er...

28:33.467 --> 28:35.147
# You can tell by the way
I use my walk...

28:35.147 --> 28:36.587
No, no, no, no!

28:36.587 --> 28:38.507
The chorus. The chorus.

28:38.507 --> 28:40.907
# Whether you're a brother
Or whether you're a mother... #

28:40.907 --> 28:43.107
That's it.
# Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

28:43.107 --> 28:45.067
# Feel the city breakin'
Everyone is shakin'... #

28:45.067 --> 28:47.387
The ambulance is on its way.
# Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

28:47.387 --> 28:50.347
The ambulance is on its way.
# Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive

28:50.347 --> 28:51.547
# Stayin' alive

28:51.547 --> 28:53.347
# Ah, ah, ah, ah

28:53.347 --> 28:58.267
# Stayin' aliiiiive... #

28:59.947 --> 29:01.387
Oh!

29:01.387 --> 29:03.707
You're all right!
It's OK! You're OK, mate.

29:03.707 --> 29:05.227
You're all right!
You're OK.

29:05.227 --> 29:07.707
Oh, my God, Pete,
you saved his life!

29:07.707 --> 29:10.547
# Ah, ah, ah, ah

29:10.547 --> 29:12.107
# Stayin' alive, stayin' alive... #

29:18.188 --> 29:20.788
Ramona!
It's Alejandro!

29:20.788 --> 29:22.708
He cheat on me!
Oh, no.

29:22.708 --> 29:26.108
The man is a count! You think
he know to treat me better, no?!

29:26.108 --> 29:29.028
Is OK I stay with you?
Oh...

29:29.028 --> 29:31.028
Yes... Yes.

29:31.028 --> 29:32.988
Thank you, Karen. I kill him!

29:42.108 --> 29:43.908
Mum, where have you been?

29:43.908 --> 29:46.388
Dad just dived into a canal!

29:47.788 --> 29:49.108
What?

29:50.428 --> 29:52.628
You bloody idiot!

29:52.628 --> 29:54.988
What were you thinking?!
Well, I wasn't.

29:54.988 --> 29:57.268
I just jumped in.
He's a hero, Mum.

29:57.268 --> 29:59.668
- He deserves a medal.
- You should be proud of him.

29:59.668 --> 30:01.628
You could've died!

30:01.628 --> 30:04.748
You don't risk your life
when you've got two kids.

30:04.748 --> 30:06.068
Are we gonna eat soon?

30:06.068 --> 30:07.428
In a minute.

30:07.428 --> 30:08.828
Possibly three...

30:10.908 --> 30:12.268
I've done a test.

30:13.388 --> 30:15.028
There is no baby.

30:42.268 --> 30:44.228
What should we do tonight?
Oh, I don't know.

30:44.228 --> 30:48.228
Erm, go to the bar,
meet your friends...

30:48.228 --> 30:50.068
I think I'd rather stay in.

30:50.068 --> 30:51.828
Netflix and chill.

30:51.828 --> 30:53.588
Well, that sounds tempting...

30:53.588 --> 30:55.188
now I know what it means.

30:55.188 --> 30:58.268
# You don't know what it's like

30:59.468 --> 31:01.828
# Baby, you don't know... #

31:04.548 --> 31:08.188
Oh. Erm, hey, I'm thinking
of inviting someone to dinner.

31:08.188 --> 31:10.508
This woman
that I'm going to be going out with.

31:10.508 --> 31:12.788
This woman
You're GOING to be going out with?

31:12.788 --> 31:14.788
Yeah. She wants to.
I just have to ask her.

31:14.788 --> 31:16.828
I thought you might like
to invite your girlfriend.

31:16.828 --> 31:18.068
A double date?

31:18.068 --> 31:19.788
I don't think so.

31:19.788 --> 31:21.668
Well, you have to eat.
And I'd like to meet her.

31:21.668 --> 31:23.268
What about Thursday?
Uh-uh.

31:23.268 --> 31:24.828
Well, you can have my jacket.

31:24.828 --> 31:26.228
Have it?

31:26.228 --> 31:27.508
Borrow it.
Have it.

31:28.868 --> 31:31.148
Have it. Thursday, OK?
Yes.

31:35.388 --> 31:37.988
He's still here?! There's
no point in going back, is there?

31:37.988 --> 31:40.988
Josh needs to toughen up,
knuckle down and finish his degree!

31:40.988 --> 31:44.268
Why?! Plenty of successful people
never finished university.

31:44.268 --> 31:46.868
Richard Branson,
Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates...

31:46.868 --> 31:48.028
So many, you can name them.

31:48.028 --> 31:50.348
Mark Zuckerberg,
Lady Gaga, Steve Jobs...

31:50.348 --> 31:51.348
Mark Zuckerberg,
Lady Gaga?

31:51.348 --> 31:53.988
Look, we are not gonna force Josh
to do something that he hates.

31:53.988 --> 31:56.308
Do you recall
the Marsden family motto?

31:56.308 --> 31:57.748
Jesus Christ, David. No, I do not.

31:57.748 --> 31:59.788
I imagine it's some bollocks
in Latin about duty and honour

31:59.788 --> 32:00.948
and not shagging below stairs.

32:00.948 --> 32:03.708
Numquam ignavis vincit.

32:03.708 --> 32:05.988
The coward never conquers.

32:05.988 --> 32:08.548
Josh is a Marsden. We don't quit.

32:08.548 --> 32:11.988
Sticking at something that you hate
makes you a loser.

32:11.988 --> 32:14.588
You don't demand enough of Josh.
You never have!

32:14.588 --> 32:16.948
No, no, no, no! Is not right!
Ramona?

32:16.948 --> 32:18.228
I know. I bring Joshie up!

32:18.228 --> 32:20.988
Well, actually, Ramona,
I did play a small part.

32:20.988 --> 32:22.948
What's she doing here?

32:22.948 --> 32:24.588
I remember Joshie.

32:24.588 --> 32:27.548
He just start crawling,
and you make me teach him toilet!

32:27.548 --> 32:29.628
You did always hold him
to an impossible standard.

32:29.628 --> 32:31.468
No more than my father did to me.

32:31.468 --> 32:33.548
And where's that got you, Dad?!

32:33.548 --> 32:36.108
Look, you might be content
trying to fill your father's shoes,

32:36.108 --> 32:38.868
but I'm not. I don't want
to follow in your footsteps.

32:38.868 --> 32:40.988
I want to live my own life!

32:40.988 --> 32:43.268
Isn't that
what we should all strive to do?

33:00.188 --> 33:03.108
How's the love life? Any joy?

33:03.108 --> 33:04.588
I haven't tried.

33:04.588 --> 33:07.428
You should.
I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

33:11.708 --> 33:13.268
Yeah, on that, erm...

33:13.268 --> 33:15.188
I've just bought
a new coffee machine.

33:15.188 --> 33:16.908
Yeah, my mate George recommended it.

33:16.908 --> 33:19.948
Well, he's more of a brother,
really. Clooney.

33:21.308 --> 33:25.468
Yeah-ha. Er, anyway,
if you, er, fancy trying a cup...

33:26.588 --> 33:29.668
..Thursday, say,
with dinner before...

33:29.668 --> 33:33.028
this... is my address.

33:33.028 --> 33:35.948
You're inviting me around
for dinner?

33:35.948 --> 33:37.988
Or we could go out, if you prefer.

33:37.988 --> 33:40.148
Oh, God, this is embarrassing.

33:40.148 --> 33:43.548
What, you don't drink coffee?
No. I mean, yes. But, no.

33:43.548 --> 33:45.908
No offence.

33:45.908 --> 33:48.788
No. Er... none taken.

33:49.868 --> 33:52.108
I'm seeing someone at the moment.

33:53.468 --> 33:55.068
Oh, so it's timing?

33:55.068 --> 33:56.388
Yeah.

33:56.388 --> 33:58.708
OK, well, look, if anything changes
before Thursday...

34:02.668 --> 34:04.388
Adam, wait...

34:05.588 --> 34:06.988
Yes?

34:06.988 --> 34:08.908
You haven't paid.

34:10.828 --> 34:12.188
Oh, sorry. Erm...

34:26.148 --> 34:29.068
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Evan Jenkins.

34:29.068 --> 34:30.748
He's over there.

34:30.748 --> 34:31.868
Thank you.

34:36.428 --> 34:39.908
All right? It's Evan, isn't it?

34:39.908 --> 34:41.947
Well, I mean,
you look a lot better than you did

34:41.947 --> 34:44.708
the last time I saw you.
And drier, too.

34:47.388 --> 34:50.947
Well, I brought you a few things
that I thought you wouldn't have.

34:50.947 --> 34:55.308
Er, toothbrush, toothpaste...
kind of thing.

34:55.308 --> 34:57.268
Er, toothbrush, toothpaste...
Oh, a bit of chocolate!

34:59.268 --> 35:00.788
Sorry, I'm Pete.

35:00.788 --> 35:03.348
I'm the bloke that pulled you
out of the canal and gave you CPR.

35:03.348 --> 35:04.628
Yeah, I know who you are.

35:13.428 --> 35:16.468
You don't have to thank me.
I wasn't going to.

35:21.548 --> 35:24.268
How'd you fall in?
I didn't.

35:24.268 --> 35:25.708
You were pushed?

35:31.348 --> 35:33.828
Jesus... You jumped?

35:35.148 --> 35:36.708
I was hoping I'd drown.

35:38.908 --> 35:41.508
And I might have if some twat
hadn't decided to act the hero.

35:41.508 --> 35:43.068
Look, mate, come on...

35:43.068 --> 35:44.348
Just piss off.

35:45.468 --> 35:46.828
Leave me alone.

35:56.708 --> 35:58.108
Go on.

36:00.148 --> 36:01.868
Just go.

36:10.108 --> 36:11.868
Yesterday,
I was on top of the world.

36:11.868 --> 36:13.828
I'd just saved a life.

36:13.828 --> 36:15.668
I thought we'd created another.

36:15.668 --> 36:17.948
It doesn't take much
to bring you down, does it?

36:19.508 --> 36:21.348
But it could be worse, Pete.

36:21.348 --> 36:23.588
How so?

36:28.348 --> 36:30.308
- Don't use my iPad!
- I didn't!

36:30.308 --> 36:33.548
Well, we might not have
two adorable kids, for a start.

36:33.548 --> 36:35.108
I've got this.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.708
Oi!
Dad, she's gone and done it!

36:38.708 --> 36:40.828
Not again. What have I told you two?

36:40.828 --> 36:43.268
Why can't she use her own?
Pack it in, will you?

36:43.268 --> 36:45.788
Oh, Dad, it's not fair!

36:53.588 --> 36:55.788
Well, this is lovely.

36:55.788 --> 36:57.748
Are we still celebrating
my settlement?

36:57.748 --> 37:01.588
Well... a lot of people
have been giving me advice.

37:01.588 --> 37:04.308
You, Karen, Josh...

37:04.308 --> 37:06.788
Ramona.

37:06.788 --> 37:09.388
And today, I acted on it.
At work?

37:09.388 --> 37:11.508
Mm. I led a staff rebellion.

37:12.588 --> 37:14.188
I was something of a hero.

37:14.188 --> 37:16.068
I've asked around, Darren,

37:16.068 --> 37:18.668
and it turns out
that no-one received a bonus.

37:18.668 --> 37:20.228
Not true, David.

37:20.228 --> 37:23.388
OK... Hands up if you got one.

37:25.908 --> 37:29.428
Individually, none of you
did enough to get a bonus,

37:29.428 --> 37:33.348
but collectively,
you did just enough to get me mine.

37:33.348 --> 37:35.148
That's not fair!

37:35.148 --> 37:36.468
David's right.

37:36.468 --> 37:38.588
Without our efforts,
you'd get nothing.

37:38.588 --> 37:42.028
My whole career, I've stood by
and watched while the few at the top

37:42.028 --> 37:44.028
took advantage
of those who do all the work.

37:44.028 --> 37:46.228
Well, no more.

37:46.228 --> 37:48.988
Well, that's obvious from which side
of the table you're sitting.

37:48.988 --> 37:52.348
No. I mean,
no more will I put up with it.

37:52.348 --> 37:54.708
I still have my self-respect.

37:54.708 --> 37:56.308
So, I'm resigning.

37:57.668 --> 37:59.308
And I advise you all to do the same.

38:00.508 --> 38:01.908
So...

38:03.828 --> 38:05.228
..who's with me?

38:19.788 --> 38:21.708
No longer, Darren,

38:21.708 --> 38:25.268
will we be broken
on the capitalist wheel!

38:27.068 --> 38:28.868
Freedom is ours!

38:35.828 --> 38:37.188
Oh, my God!

38:37.188 --> 38:39.828
David, you were magnificent!

38:39.828 --> 38:42.988
Well, you know,
someone has to make a stand.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.508
So, what do we do now?

38:46.228 --> 38:48.708
What do you mean?
Well, what's the plan?

38:49.988 --> 38:52.268
Well, I...
thought I might take a little time

38:52.268 --> 38:53.668
to consider my next move.

38:58.548 --> 39:01.028
Well, I can see that, you know,

39:01.028 --> 39:03.948
if you've got
outstanding student loans and...

39:03.948 --> 39:05.748
and a mortgage and...

39:05.748 --> 39:07.788
if you've got a baby on the way,

39:07.788 --> 39:10.868
then it might be a luxury
you can ill afford.

39:18.908 --> 39:20.708
'You were a hero.'

39:20.708 --> 39:23.228
'Mm. Briefly.

39:23.228 --> 39:25.588
'And then a pariah.'

39:25.588 --> 39:26.948
So, er, that's that.

39:29.628 --> 39:31.908
Does the offer
of a loan still stand?

39:31.908 --> 39:33.188
No.

39:33.188 --> 39:34.508
Ah...

39:35.908 --> 39:40.068
It wasn't a loan.
I don't need you to pay me back.

39:43.188 --> 39:45.628
Then I think
we are still celebrating.

39:45.628 --> 39:46.908
A bottle of the Moet, please.

39:50.628 --> 39:52.588
Matt, your girlfriend's here!

39:57.788 --> 39:59.308
Matt?!

40:02.468 --> 40:03.908
Gemma!

40:03.908 --> 40:05.268
Adam!

40:05.268 --> 40:08.028
I wasn't expecting to see you.
No.

40:08.028 --> 40:09.948
No, it's great.
Great. Not a problem.

40:09.948 --> 40:12.468
I've got enough for four.
Come in. Come on.

40:12.468 --> 40:15.588
God, I'm so delighted
you decided to come.

40:15.588 --> 40:17.388
Oh, Matt!

40:17.388 --> 40:20.868
Er, this is Gemma.
Remember I mentioned her to you?

40:20.868 --> 40:22.228
What?

40:22.228 --> 40:24.668
So, did you dump the guy
that you were seeing?

40:24.668 --> 40:27.468
No...
How's that gonna work?

40:27.468 --> 40:29.348
Er, Dad...

40:29.348 --> 40:30.668
Gemma's my girlfriend.

40:35.388 --> 40:37.028
What?

40:37.028 --> 40:39.388
You were hitting on my girlfriend?!
No. No!

40:39.388 --> 40:41.948
Yes. I mean, well, I didn't know
she was your girlfriend.

40:41.948 --> 40:43.748
She was hitting on me!
No, I wasn't!

40:43.748 --> 40:45.468
Oh, really? "Come-to-bed eyes."

40:45.468 --> 40:47.548
Yeah, you have nice eyes.
So does he.

40:47.548 --> 40:48.788
It's genetic.

40:48.788 --> 40:50.268
You said you'd swipe right.

40:50.268 --> 40:52.348
"If old was my thing."
Old?!

40:52.348 --> 40:55.428
Old?! Do you want to talk about age?
He's 17!

40:56.908 --> 40:59.468
You told me you were 22.

40:59.468 --> 41:02.068
Ah...
Oh, my God, Matt.

41:02.068 --> 41:03.268
You're barely legal!

41:03.268 --> 41:04.548
Gemma...

41:04.548 --> 41:05.668
Dad!

41:05.668 --> 41:07.148
Gemma...

41:07.148 --> 41:08.748
Gemma, wa-wa-wait!

41:08.748 --> 41:10.188
Please!

41:10.188 --> 41:12.548
Stay here, we can talk about this.

41:12.548 --> 41:14.548
17?!
Yeah, well...

41:18.748 --> 41:21.508
I'm proud of you, Dad.
What, for quitting my job?

41:21.508 --> 41:23.468
Yeah, it must've been hard for you.

41:23.468 --> 41:25.828
Well, the thought of how much
it would've upset my father

41:25.828 --> 41:27.508
made it slightly easier.

41:30.788 --> 41:34.348
Look, I don't want you to feel
you have to live in my shoes.

41:35.868 --> 41:38.428
I find them uncomfortable enough
as it is.

41:38.428 --> 41:42.908
And you're right, Josh,
you have to live your own life.

41:42.908 --> 41:46.068
And I trust you
to make the right decisions.

41:46.068 --> 41:48.228
Really?

41:48.228 --> 41:53.348
Because Ramona's going back to
Barcelona, and I'm going with her.

41:53.348 --> 41:54.948
Karen?

41:54.948 --> 41:58.628
He plans on getting a job, David.
Two, in fact.

41:58.628 --> 42:01.628
Yeah, working in a bar
and teaching English.

42:01.628 --> 42:03.348
He learn to speak Spanish proper.

42:03.348 --> 42:04.868
Proper-ly.

42:04.868 --> 42:06.868
Look, he'll be fluent within a year.

42:06.868 --> 42:08.588
That's quicker
than if he were at uni.

42:08.588 --> 42:11.228
And in time, I, er, I want
to start my own language school.

42:11.228 --> 42:14.268
Ah, an entrepreneur.

42:14.268 --> 42:16.388
Spain's where I was happiest, Dad.

42:16.388 --> 42:18.508
Then...

42:18.508 --> 42:22.908
I think that sounds like
a very good idea.

42:44.068 --> 42:45.308
She dumped me.

42:47.068 --> 42:48.348
Thanks, Dad.

42:52.228 --> 42:53.508
I'm sorry.

42:53.508 --> 42:55.148
I really liked her.

42:55.148 --> 42:56.708
I know.

42:58.948 --> 43:01.228
What is wrong with you?

43:01.228 --> 43:03.268
It was bad enough
at Ramona's wedding,

43:03.268 --> 43:06.428
running after women half your age,
but this...

43:08.108 --> 43:10.948
I didn't know
she was your girlfriend.

43:10.948 --> 43:14.388
The fact that she could be
is what makes it wrong.

43:14.388 --> 43:18.028
The fact she was,
that makes it worse.

43:20.628 --> 43:22.308
You embarrass me, Dad.

43:24.628 --> 43:26.228
You're just sad...

43:28.268 --> 43:30.388
..and totally pathetic.

44:01.028 --> 44:02.868
I don't know, Karen.
Maybe Matt has a point.

44:02.868 --> 44:04.708
Perhaps I am beginning
to look ridiculous.

44:04.708 --> 44:05.788
Your hair was.

44:05.788 --> 44:07.588
Well, you never said.
Well, I'm your friend.

44:07.588 --> 44:09.948
That's what friends are for,
to tell you uncomfortable truths.

44:09.948 --> 44:12.988
You looked ridiculous.
Yes, all right, you've said that.

44:12.988 --> 44:14.948
Is that her?

44:14.948 --> 44:16.708
Uh-huh.

44:16.708 --> 44:18.068
You idiot.

44:18.068 --> 44:20.188
Hiya.
Hey.

44:20.188 --> 44:22.988
Sorry... for the misunderstanding.

44:22.988 --> 44:24.908
Forgotten.

44:24.908 --> 44:28.228
One thing. The love heart, I get,
but the Cupid's arrow...?

44:30.068 --> 44:33.748
Oh, no. I just haven't
got a hang of the nozzle yet.

44:36.388 --> 44:38.148
Ah...

44:38.148 --> 44:40.468
Hey, it's my favourite customer.

44:40.468 --> 44:42.028
Hello, can I have my usual, please?

44:42.028 --> 44:43.388
Yeah, of course you can.

44:44.708 --> 44:47.748
I don't wanna grow old.
Why not?

44:47.748 --> 44:50.988
Because I'm not ready to.
Well, you don't have much choice.

44:50.988 --> 44:53.148
Uncomfortable truth?
Hm?

44:53.148 --> 44:55.068
You're gonna die.
What?

44:55.068 --> 44:57.428
You're scared of death.
Oh, shut up.

44:57.428 --> 45:00.188
No, it's true. Ask yourself, why
do you always date younger women?

45:00.188 --> 45:01.988
Because I can.

45:01.988 --> 45:03.428
Well, I could.

45:03.428 --> 45:05.548
No, you're hoping their youth's
gonna rub off on you

45:05.548 --> 45:06.628
and you'll live longer.

45:06.628 --> 45:08.788
It doesn't work like that, Adam.
Face it, you're 50.

45:08.788 --> 45:10.228
50?!

45:11.548 --> 45:15.468
Look, you have a limited
amount of time left.

45:15.468 --> 45:17.628
Do you want to waste it
chasing immortality?

45:17.628 --> 45:19.308
Because you will fail.

45:19.308 --> 45:21.828
And you're gonna end up
dying lonely and alone.

45:23.188 --> 45:25.468
Alternatively...

45:25.468 --> 45:27.828
you can embrace your age.

45:27.828 --> 45:30.148
Throw yourself at your future
with someone who's lived,

45:30.148 --> 45:31.508
who wants to live.

45:31.508 --> 45:33.228
Someone you can grow old with.

45:33.228 --> 45:36.308
Well, how am I gonna find her?
I don't know.

45:36.308 --> 45:38.748
But that's your quest.

45:50.308 --> 45:55.428
# Someone out there loves you

45:57.468 --> 46:03.268
# Someone out there is lonely, too

46:04.708 --> 46:06.348
# They may not know it

46:06.348 --> 46:10.428
# They may be trying to tell you

46:10.428 --> 46:14.068
# And you may not know
Till you pass on the street

46:14.068 --> 46:16.148
# Your heads turn, your eyes lock

46:16.148 --> 46:17.748
# And you feel complete... #
