It is over, Sauron.

Quickly! Before he revives.

02:59.375 --> 03:01.416
You must leave this place.

03:03.583 --> 03:09.166
I am Zaladane,
High Priestess of
the Sun God, Garokk.

03:09.166 --> 03:12.708
I know you must absorb
mutant life-energy

03:12.708 --> 03:15.500
to retain your
powers as Sauron.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.750
SAURON: But how did you know?

03:18.208 --> 03:20.416
Garokk is wise.

03:20.416 --> 03:22.291
Garokk doesn't exist!

03:22.291 --> 03:27.000
He is a fairy tale,
made up to scare children.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.333
Garokk is life.

03:32.875 --> 03:35.083
I live to serve him.

03:41.416 --> 03:46.416
The outlander called Magneto
brought this vehicle to
our valley. Use it!

03:46.416 --> 03:52.125
They hate Sauron.
I am Karl Lykos now. I am safe.

03:52.958 --> 03:57.583
With no mutants left here,
I will never become
Sauron again.

03:57.583 --> 04:00.000
Ka-Zar won't take that chance.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.125
For your recent tyranny,

04:02.125 --> 04:05.000
Ka-Zar and his Fall People
will hunt you down
and destroy you.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.583
You must flee.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.625
Quickly, before
Ka-Zar finds you!

04:09.625 --> 04:13.958
The power of Garokk
will protect you.

04:13.958 --> 04:17.958

At your pace, Rogue,
I'm surprised you can
tell the difference.

05:05.083 --> 05:07.125
A gal's got to let
loose now and again.

05:07.125 --> 05:08.875
You ought to give it a try.

05:08.875 --> 05:11.125
I admire your spirit, Rogue.

05:11.125 --> 05:15.125
But unlike you, I must keep my
emotions in check,

05:15.125 --> 05:18.458

rage out of control.

05:18.583 --> 05:20.708

What am I searching for?

06:04.958 --> 06:07.708
My friend, why the foreboding
countenance?

06:07.708 --> 06:10.458
Staring at skeletons
makes me nervous.

06:10.583 --> 06:13.083
Well it makes me bored!

06:13.083 --> 06:17.208
What could be more
yawn-inspiring than a
zillion-year-old canary?

06:17.875 --> 06:20.291
So, whither now?

06:20.291 --> 06:23.125
How about the Guggenheim,
for the Magritte exhibit?

06:23.125 --> 06:25.875
How about a chili dog
with the works?

a fossilized canary!

I sense overwhelming power!

15:19.000 --> 15:21.458

Sauron raised an army
and captured many of my people.

were overmatched.

but given up hope.

where it came from
or how it got there.

15:52.416 --> 15:56.333
Though I was suspicious,
to my people it was a sign.

15:56.333 --> 16:01.375
They rallied,
destroyed Sauron's army,
and overthrew his tyranny.

16:02.375 --> 16:05.208
They believe Garokk
gave them the strength.

I do not know.

(MAN SCREAMING)

17:13.083 --> 17:15.833
So, anyone else
want to wrestle?

17:15.833 --> 17:16.833
(GRUNTS)

17:17.458 --> 17:20.958
I defeated you
in your own land, mammal.

17:20.958 --> 17:24.166
You have no chance
in my domain.

17:24.166 --> 17:26.875
You can't beat me
if you can't catch me.

17:32.458 --> 17:33.583
(SAURON SCREAMS)

17:34.208 --> 17:37.000
What's wrong, bird-boy?
Forget your overcoat?

17:40.291 --> 17:44.000
Look into my eyes, child.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.208
Oh, no. You ain't pulling
that trick twice.

17:47.208 --> 17:48.458
Very well.

17:53.166 --> 17:57.583
Getting weaker.
Must re-energize.

17:57.583 --> 18:00.833
The only place you're
going is down, bub!

18:03.000 --> 18:05.875
Pity you can't fly.

18:05.875 --> 18:08.583
I sense a recurring motif.

18:08.750 --> 18:14.583
OK, Jubilee,
you're the only one left.
No problem.

18:17.416 --> 18:18.875
Chew on this!

18:18.875 --> 18:20.250
(SAURON SCREAMING)

18:21.000 --> 18:22.208
Wow!

18:22.208 --> 18:23.625
Impudent whelp!

18:24.458 --> 18:27.083
No! Not now!

18:36.458 --> 18:40.125
Your plan is reaching
fruition, my lord.

18:40.125 --> 18:44.375
Soon the Savage Land
will be cleansed of
all disbelievers,

18:44.375 --> 18:47.500
and the Age of Garokk
will begin anew.

18:47.500 --> 18:48.750
(RUMBLING)

18:48.750 --> 18:51.500
GAROKK: The time has come.

18:51.500 --> 18:54.875
Release the weather witch.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.583
(SCREAMING)

18:58.208 --> 19:00.875
ZALADANE: Allow me to help you.

19:00.875 --> 19:03.500
You are now free,
weather witch.

19:03.500 --> 19:06.500
You are no longer
food for Sauron.

19:06.500 --> 19:09.750
You can revel in
the power of the elements!

19:11.250 --> 19:12.708
(STORM SCREAMING)

19:13.375 --> 19:16.583
Garokk's will be done!

19:20.083 --> 19:23.583
So, what about that babysitter?

19:31.333 --> 19:36.291
Wolverine, no! Karl?
Is it really you?

19:36.291 --> 19:37.875
You know this creep?

19:37.875 --> 19:40.083
I know him to be a good man.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.458
I was. Until Sauron took over.

19:44.458 --> 19:46.500
But how?

19:46.500 --> 19:50.583
Mr. Sinister used me
as a guinea pig
in his experiments.

19:51.125 --> 19:54.125
Now I need to drain energy

19:54.125 --> 19:58.583
from innocent victims
just to stay alive.

19:58.583 --> 20:00.708
If I absorb it from a mutant,

20:00.708 --> 20:04.458
I become the abomination
you just defeated.

20:04.458 --> 20:10.291
I have no control
over him, but I must
answer for his crimes.

20:10.416 --> 20:12.833
I don't deserve to live.

20:13.375 --> 20:14.583
Do not despair.

20:15.583 --> 20:18.708
The X-Men have vast
experience in studying
human mutation.

20:18.708 --> 20:21.708
Professor Xavier
and I will combine
our knowledge

20:21.708 --> 20:23.583
to aid you in your quandary.

20:23.583 --> 20:27.000
Meantime, how about showing us
where you got Storm hid?

20:27.583 --> 20:29.250
On the other hand...

20:33.583 --> 20:34.750
It can't be.

20:37.083 --> 20:38.583
(STORM SCREAMING)
