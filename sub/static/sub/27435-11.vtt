If Reddington says
there's a conspiracy,

09:28.830 --> 09:31.469

it's a fact.

09:39.410 --> 09:41.731
I came here hoping
for a commutation.

gives Reddington the chance

09:43.780 --> 09:46.749

I'll happily ask for that.

If we expect to have any hope
Of saving Reddington's life,

11:46.030 --> 11:49.431
we have to name this depositor
at the Banque Vertrauen.

11:49.470 --> 11:52.109
TO do that, we have to access
the bank's computer networks.

11:52.140 --> 11:53.869
The problem is,
\_/e_rtrauen has
criminal accounts

11:53.910 --> 11:56.947
around the world,
meaning they're very private,

11:56.980 --> 12:00.313
so they maintain networks that
they claim are impenetrable.

12:00.350 --> 12:02.215
A brief peek at their system
looks like they're running

12:02.250 --> 12:04.889
a wickedly advanced
Least Privilege program

12:04.920 --> 12:08.219
with access controls
and redundant audit trails.

12:08.260 --> 12:10.023

It's un-hackable.

12:10.060 --> 12:11.527

even senior level employees,

12:11.560 --> 12:13.221
they only have access
tO selected fragments

12:13.260 --> 12:14.693
Of the bank's
computer system.

12:14.730 --> 12:16.652
All except one.
According to Reddington,

12:16.700 --> 12:19.089
the bank president is able
tO override the network

12:19.130 --> 12:21.530
using an encrypted fob
he carries at work.

12:21.570 --> 12:23.663
SO we get the fOb,
the fob gets us access,

12:23.710 --> 12:26.304
and the access
gets us the name
Of the mysterious depositor.

12:26.340 --> 12:28.205
Okay, so,
who's the bank president?

12:28.240 --> 12:30.708
We don't know.
The bank doesn't make
that information public.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.345
Just so I'm clear,
we need to break into a bank
that caters to criminals

12:34.380 --> 12:36.814
and penetrate
their impenetrable
computer network,

12:36.850 --> 12:39.341
all in order to identify
a secret depositor

12:39.390 --> 12:41.654

Reddington's life?

12:41.690 --> 12:43.578
I can ID
the bank president.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.029

12:45.060 --> 12:46.948
NO. But I will.
