00:00.033 --> 00:01.902
Previously on "All Stars..."

00:01.902 --> 00:03.337
For this week's
maxi challenge,

00:03.337 --> 00:06.974
you'll be appearing on
a twisted daytime court show,

00:06.974 --> 00:08.575
"Jersey Justice."

00:08.575 --> 00:11.345
This is my courtroom.
You don't talk to me that way.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.580
I want my $5.000.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.482
Naomi and I
are topping tonight.

00:15.482 --> 00:17.718
You're on your freaking
second marriage.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.454
- Security.
- Security? Sugar daddy.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.424
[snores]

00:24.424 --> 00:25.859
It wasn't your best, Latrice.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.128
But no one wants
to send your ass home, bitch.

00:28.128 --> 00:30.530
Girl, you're so beloved.
You ain't going home.

00:30.530 --> 00:34.401
You guys basically handed
the scene over to Monique.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.972
Monique Heart, Manila Luzon,

00:38.972 --> 00:41.508
you're the top two All Stars
of the week.

00:41.508 --> 00:42.709
[applause]

00:42.709 --> 00:45.145
I'm gonna tear
the fucking roof off this place

00:45.145 --> 00:47.848
to save my friend.

00:47.848 --> 00:51.385
Bitch, the bottom line is that
it is shady if I go home today.

00:52.619 --> 00:55.222
Monique Heart,
you're a winner, baby.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.490
[applause]

00:56.490 --> 01:00.193
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

01:00.193 --> 01:02.362
I chose Latrice.

01:04.531 --> 01:08.568
Latrice Royale, sashay away.

01:18.478 --> 01:19.880
Latrice!

01:21.515 --> 01:25.319
Oh, Latrice is gone,

01:25.319 --> 01:29.523
and I feel like I've let down
someone I love so much.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.358
I feel like
I've let myself down.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.428
And I'm just wrecked.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.564
"It ain't over
till the fat lady sings.

01:37.564 --> 01:38.732
"I love you all.

01:38.732 --> 01:41.335
"Stay fierce and above all,
love each other.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.970
Latrice Royale."

01:42.970 --> 01:44.604
A class fucking act, girl.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.273
I love you, Tricee.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.941
- Love you, Latrice.
- Love you, boo.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.042
Love you, Latrice.

01:49.042 --> 01:50.811
I will see you
on the road, bitch.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.612
Monique, you should be
so proud of yourself.

01:52.612 --> 01:53.647
You really should.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.048
They fucking ate you up.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.117
You really turned
that lip sync out.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.785
Her wig stayed on.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.954
- Let's celebrate that.
- Yay.

02:00.954 --> 02:04.124
This elimination was hard
because it was Latrice,

02:04.124 --> 02:05.659
and I love Latrice.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.227
But I saved Monét

02:07.227 --> 02:10.464
because Monét
had a better report card.

02:10.464 --> 02:13.967
America, I didn't keep Monét
because she's my friend.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.903
Like, I love the bitch,
but not that much.

02:16.903 --> 02:20.907
I'm very grateful
that Monique decided to save me

02:20.907 --> 02:22.843
and give me another week

02:22.843 --> 02:24.144
to fucking prove my worth
here in the competition.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.345
You know what I mean?

02:25.345 --> 02:28.181
Was that a hard decision
to make, Monique?

02:28.181 --> 02:29.816
It was report card.
That's what we're holding.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.118
Had it been me in the bottom,
y'all would have said

02:31.118 --> 02:33.153
well, Monique, you were
in the bottom already,

02:33.153 --> 02:34.187
so you're going home.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.124
She had it easy

02:37.124 --> 02:40.260
because her friend has
done better than my friend.

02:40.260 --> 02:43.997
And so she can follow her heart
and also be fair.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.665
How do you feel right now,
Manila?

02:45.665 --> 02:47.934
I mean, it's just so...

02:47.934 --> 02:51.905
It's so hard because
I couldn't save my friend,

02:51.905 --> 02:55.308
and that makes me feel
like I'm not good enough.

02:55.308 --> 02:58.645
Everyone in the room
loves Latrice,

02:58.645 --> 03:01.448
but they don't love Latrice
the way I do.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.216
You know, they don't have
our history.

03:03.216 --> 03:05.318
They don't have
that loyalty to each other

03:05.318 --> 03:06.553
the way that we do.

03:06.553 --> 03:09.756
And it's weighing down on me
in this moment.

03:09.756 --> 03:13.160
And it's just
so much harder than I expected.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.595
Can I just assume
that Monét's name

03:15.595 --> 03:16.630
is in your titty right now?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.534
I'm sorry, girl.
It's just that, you know,

03:20.534 --> 03:22.669
when it comes down to it,

03:22.669 --> 03:26.940
I just can't deny
what's in my heart.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.842
You know how loyal I am
to my friends.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.911
So I'm so sorry.

03:30.911 --> 03:35.282
You know, there's no rule book
of how to play "All Stars."

03:35.282 --> 03:37.017
If you wanted to pick my name
to go home,

03:37.017 --> 03:39.786
that's your prerogative and how
you want to play the game,

03:39.786 --> 03:42.089
and it's good to know.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.390
Bitch, I'm gagged.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.325
The bitch was gonna send me home
when I was doing well.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.928
Now we're all realizing

03:47.928 --> 03:50.330
the kind of game that she wants
to play, and you know what?

03:50.330 --> 03:53.500
Drag queens, bitch?
A drag queen scorned, girl?

03:55.035 --> 03:57.537
I'm done. [sniffles]

04:03.410 --> 04:04.911
All right.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.414
I don't know
if the other girls understand

04:07.414 --> 04:11.852
that I owed it to my friend
to do my best to keep her here,

04:11.852 --> 04:14.154
because I failed her before.

04:14.154 --> 04:16.623
At the end of the day,
this is my decision.

04:16.623 --> 04:17.791
And you know what?

04:17.791 --> 04:20.093
I didn't get to exercise it,
so lucky you.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.094
You get to stay.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.964
Miss Congeniality is cracked,

04:23.964 --> 04:28.502
the trophy is down,
and I am ready to play ball.

04:28.502 --> 04:31.571
If Manila is in the bottom,

04:31.571 --> 04:33.740
we don't even need
to deliberate.

04:33.740 --> 04:37.711
I'm turning the lip sync out,
and you are going home.

Last week was last week.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.152
they just tucker out.

You're killing me, Mary.

06:03.430 --> 06:04.831

any time soon.

06:04.831 --> 06:05.832
Yes, bitch,
you gonna outlive us all.

06:05.832 --> 06:07.534
Hello, hello, hello.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.569
- [cheers]
- Ladies.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.805
- Come on, butterfly.
- Butterflies.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.773
You know, like I always say,

06:13.773 --> 06:17.444
as queer people, we get
to choose our families.

06:17.444 --> 06:22.649
And over 30 years ago,
I chose my twisted sister...

06:22.649 --> 06:23.850
[drum roll]

06:23.850 --> 06:27.187
The Lady Bunny.
[cheers and applause]

06:29.155 --> 06:32.092
Lady Bunny
is the funniest, nastiest,

06:32.092 --> 06:34.294
smartest person I know.

06:34.294 --> 06:38.098
I may not be a boxer,
but I can sure take a pounding.

06:38.098 --> 06:42.035
I met her
when she was 19 years old,

06:42.035 --> 06:44.437
and I actually put her in drag
the very first time.

06:44.437 --> 06:47.007
- Oh.
- Yes, blame me.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.676
Blame me.
[all laugh]

06:49.676 --> 06:51.177
And when we moved to New York,

06:51.177 --> 06:55.682
she started the legendary
Wigstock Festival,

06:55.682 --> 06:57.217
and I haven't spoken
to her since.

06:57.217 --> 07:00.153
[all laugh]

07:00.153 --> 07:05.992
So it's with heavy heart
that I share this sad news.

07:05.992 --> 07:09.062
For this week's
maxi challenge,

07:09.062 --> 07:11.831
we're celebrating
the life and times

07:11.831 --> 07:14.000
of the great Lady Bunny.

07:15.802 --> 07:17.804
May she roast in peace.

07:17.804 --> 07:21.374
- [cheers and applause]
- Okay.

07:21.374 --> 07:24.711
Now, each of you needs
to write and perform a eulogy

07:24.711 --> 07:30.016
as hilarious and outrageous
as Bun-Bun herself.

#AllStars4

07:32.252 --> 07:34.621
Now, Monique,
you won last week,

07:34.621 --> 07:40.660
so you get to choose the order
in which the queens appear.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.963
Dearly beloveds,
start your engines,

07:43.963 --> 07:46.733
and may the best All Star win.

07:46.733 --> 07:47.967
- Yes!
- Whoo!

07:50.837 --> 07:52.639
Girl, black funerals,
they have like 19 eulogies.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.508
Yes, girl, and you smell
the fried chicken coming from--

07:55.508 --> 07:57.210
It's like, let's go, girl.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.611
Cut, put her in the dirt,
and let's go.

07:58.611 --> 07:59.779
Put her in there.

07:59.779 --> 08:02.782
I want to go to one.
I'm starving.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.351
- I'm starving.
- We'll just go.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.219
We'll just look in the
newspaper, find someone.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.554
You know, I used to do that
in Brooklyn.

08:07.554 --> 08:10.223
I would show up and be like,
yes, I miss her, too.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.192
[laughs]
Get out. Are you serious?

08:12.192 --> 08:14.394
Girl, me and my three friends.

08:14.394 --> 08:18.431
Everyone has crashed a funeral
in their lifetime.

08:18.431 --> 08:19.933
Am I alone?

08:19.933 --> 08:21.634
- Have you thought about--
- Bitch.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.169
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.838
I didn't mean
to scare you, girl.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.673
Have you thought about
how you're going--

08:26.673 --> 08:28.141
what order you're going to do?

08:28.141 --> 08:29.876
Um, yeah.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.011
I know how to play the game.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.314
I'm going to use this power
to my advantage.

08:34.314 --> 08:35.949
Hopefully it works.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.617
I know I want to go
in the middle.

08:37.617 --> 08:39.052
Um...

08:40.587 --> 08:41.788
First.

08:41.788 --> 08:43.456
Yes.

08:43.456 --> 08:44.591
Opening. I like that.

08:44.591 --> 08:45.592
So you're going to open it.

08:45.592 --> 08:46.993
- Girl, I'm ready, girl.
- Okay.

08:46.993 --> 08:48.928
Second.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.063
Okay.

08:50.063 --> 08:54.401
So one, two, three,
four, five, last.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.569
I'm last?

08:56.569 --> 08:58.138
This is so much more pressure

08:58.138 --> 09:01.408
because I have to close the show
with a bang.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.376
If I don't give
everything I've got,

09:03.376 --> 09:04.878
I might find myself
in the bottom.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.880
Stunning.
So Manila will close.

09:06.880 --> 09:11.618
Miss Manila has been doing very
well in the comedy challenges,

09:11.618 --> 09:12.919
so I put her last.

09:12.919 --> 09:14.220
On purpose.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.857
Because ending the show
is hard, America.

09:17.857 --> 09:20.693
You bomb, you're going home.

09:27.534 --> 09:28.701
Bunny is dead.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.036
[cries and laughs]

09:30.036 --> 09:31.738
I need another word.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.340
Do we have a thesaurus?

09:34.340 --> 09:39.479
This week's maxi challenge
is the roast of Lady Bunny.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.314
She is dead before us,

09:41.314 --> 09:44.284
and we have to give
our Ru-ology?

09:44.284 --> 09:46.152
Ru-eulogy? A Ru-eulogy.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.925
Right now I at least just want
to have one joke to tell Ru,

09:51.925 --> 09:54.661
just so that he can tell me
if my humor is--

09:54.661 --> 09:55.995
- There.
- There.

09:55.995 --> 09:57.464
Lady Bunny smells so bad,

09:57.464 --> 10:00.733
I heard she uses Wigstock
as her signature scent.

10:00.733 --> 10:03.736
It smells like wet rag
and shit at the same time.

10:06.973 --> 10:08.808
Hey, All Stars.

10:08.808 --> 10:10.176
- Hello.
- Hey, Ru.

10:10.176 --> 10:12.812
Why so quiet?
It's like a funeral in here.

10:12.812 --> 10:14.047
[all laugh]

10:14.047 --> 10:16.182
- Monét X Change.
- RuPaul.

10:16.182 --> 10:17.317
Where da money at?

10:17.317 --> 10:18.818
I don't know.
I'm trying to find it.

10:18.818 --> 10:19.752
Yeah, you've got
that dashiki on.

10:19.752 --> 10:20.887
Where'd you get that?

10:20.887 --> 10:23.790
Well, you know,
it was $3.00 on 125th,

10:23.790 --> 10:25.024
so I was like, mine.

10:25.024 --> 10:26.159
Yeah, that's
your eating dress.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.293
[laughs]

10:27.293 --> 10:29.095
So you were in
the bottom two last week.

10:29.095 --> 10:30.597
I was.

10:30.597 --> 10:31.931
Does this scare you,
this eulogy?

10:31.931 --> 10:34.033
I am going first,

10:34.033 --> 10:35.735
so that is setting the tone
for the whole thing.

10:35.735 --> 10:38.204
And as we all know
in "Drag Race" herstory,

10:38.204 --> 10:40.573
if you fuck up in the beginning,
you're done, girl.

10:40.573 --> 10:41.941
Have you worked
with Lady Bunny?

10:41.941 --> 10:43.576
We've never necessarily
worked together,

10:43.576 --> 10:45.645
but I have seen her
running around the West Village

10:45.645 --> 10:47.113
with her little go-go heels,

10:47.113 --> 10:49.782
and her wig bopping down behind
her down Christopher Street.

10:49.782 --> 10:52.552
- Yeah.
- Her comedy is so, like--

10:52.552 --> 10:56.723
she just makes you feel okay
about, like, the worst things.

10:56.723 --> 10:59.893
Well, Lady Bunny makes it okay
for you to make fun of her

10:59.893 --> 11:01.794
because she makes fun
of everybody else.

11:01.794 --> 11:04.430
So she allows you
to make fun of her.

11:04.430 --> 11:05.932
Are you going to
make fun of her?

11:05.932 --> 11:07.734
Oh, I am going to destroy her.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.168
Well, bitch,
you better make me laugh.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.670
- I'm praying.
- I'll see you out there.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.071
- Okay, Ru.
- All right, thanks.

11:12.071 --> 11:14.541
- Thank you.
- Hi, Valentina.

11:14.541 --> 11:15.542
Hi, mamacita.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.877
You've done roasts
here before.

11:17.877 --> 11:20.713
- I have.
- And you were safe.

11:20.713 --> 11:21.748
It was good.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.082
Was it good?

11:23.082 --> 11:26.352
Michelle,
you is such tired-ass ho

11:26.352 --> 11:30.690
that when you got carpal tunnel
from giving out free hand jobs,

11:30.690 --> 11:32.659
she just became left-handed.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.460
I'm so confused.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.496
Tell me about your jokes.
Do you know Lady Bunny?

11:36.496 --> 11:38.131
I know Lady Bunny personally.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.132
I've been on tour with her.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.967
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.136
As Lady Bunny, I want you
to talk about Valentina.

11:44.304 --> 11:47.473
Girl, can you keep it on?
Please.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.977
- Keep what on?
- The mask.

11:50.977 --> 11:54.414
She always tells me,
please keep it on. Please.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.450
Do you consider yourself
a comedy queen?

11:57.450 --> 11:58.685
Absolutely not.

11:58.685 --> 12:00.119
- No.
- No.

12:00.119 --> 12:02.221
You are a what queen?
Fill in the blank.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.423
- A star.
- Star queen.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.624
- Yes.
- Okay.

12:04.624 --> 12:08.795
I'm totally fine
not being a comedy queen.

12:08.795 --> 12:11.631
There's so many out there,
and they do it well.

12:11.631 --> 12:14.400
That being said,
being a funny queen

12:14.400 --> 12:17.170
would be fucking helpful
right now.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.806
I know who Valentina is.

12:19.806 --> 12:22.475
It's usually something
to do with glamour. But--

12:22.475 --> 12:25.778
You can do the Valentina
character with the fashion,

12:25.778 --> 12:28.948
but do you doing a eulogy
for Lady Bunny.

12:28.948 --> 12:30.783
You know what I'm saying?

12:30.783 --> 12:32.852
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen.

12:32.852 --> 12:35.455
The wheel
has already been invented,

12:35.455 --> 12:37.857
so just do your wheel.

12:37.857 --> 12:38.858
- Okay.
- All right.

12:38.858 --> 12:39.892
We'll see you out there.

12:39.892 --> 12:41.728
Thank you so much, Ru.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.930
Trinity The Tuck.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.031
You're a funny bitch.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.099
Oh, God,
please don't say that.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.500
You are.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.036
Bitch, you've been on stage
since the day you were born.

12:50.036 --> 12:53.706
I don't understand why
you come up into my house,

12:53.706 --> 12:57.377
and you want to act like,
oh, oh, I'm all shy.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.412
Oh, girl.
I don't understand that.

12:59.412 --> 13:00.980
What makes me the most nervous

13:00.980 --> 13:04.450
is the fact that this is like my
last hurdle to prove to myself

13:04.450 --> 13:07.820
that I can do the things
that I didn't do well last time.

13:09.222 --> 13:13.159
The roast on Season 9
was my biggest challenge.

13:13.159 --> 13:14.594
I was bottom three.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.729
Michelle, every time
I walk the runway,

13:16.729 --> 13:18.998
you have this pungent look
on your face.

13:18.998 --> 13:21.901
I reckon they have
some laxatives for that.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.371
When you're trying
to deliver jokes,

13:25.371 --> 13:29.676
it's an eternity in purgatory.

13:29.676 --> 13:31.644
And I don't want to go to hell.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.912
Again.

13:32.912 --> 13:35.581
Don't overthink it.

13:35.581 --> 13:39.018
You're giving a friggin' eulogy
to a dead whore,

13:39.018 --> 13:40.820
for cryin' out loud.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.188
How hard can that be?

13:42.188 --> 13:43.489
Yeah.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.858
And you're from Alabama.
Bunny's from Tennessee.

13:45.858 --> 13:49.262
You know, that connection there
is innately funny.

13:49.262 --> 13:52.065
No, it's not,
'cause we're probably cousins.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.100
[both laugh]

13:54.100 --> 13:57.170
I do think I'm funny,
but there's a difference

13:57.170 --> 14:00.973
between being funny
with an act written out,

14:00.973 --> 14:02.508
and just being funny.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.711
Because not everybody
can do a roast.

14:04.711 --> 14:08.881
And I don't feel confident
with that yet.

14:08.881 --> 14:10.750
Make me laugh.
I'll see you out there.

14:10.750 --> 14:11.984
- Okay. Thank you, Ru.
- Okay.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.120
Manila Luzon.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.354
- Hi, Ru.
- You know Lady Bunny.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.622
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Personally.

14:16.622 --> 14:17.690
Have you worked with her?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.025
I've worked with her
several times.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.193
Have you ever seen her
out of drag?

14:20.193 --> 14:21.461
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.463
Because she looks
entirely different.

14:23.463 --> 14:24.764
She looks like a homeless man.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.899
I mean, and she smells
like one, too.

14:26.899 --> 14:31.104
So now, at the funeral, do you
know what you're going to wear?

14:31.104 --> 14:33.373
I'm going to be wearing
celebratory black.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.440
[laughs]

14:34.440 --> 14:36.175
Because finally
Lady Bunny's dead.

14:36.175 --> 14:38.578
We've just been waiting
and waiting and waiting

14:38.578 --> 14:40.446
for this old hag to finally die.

14:40.446 --> 14:41.981
[laughs]

14:44.851 --> 14:46.285
Oh, fuck.

14:46.285 --> 14:47.887
I'm nervous because Manila,

14:47.887 --> 14:50.022
who used to live in New York
for the past 10 years,

14:50.022 --> 14:52.325
who knows Lady Bunny,

14:52.325 --> 14:55.394
she is making Ru laugh
probably the most.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.430
Gagging.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.632
All right, Manila.
We'll see you there.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.234
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.270
Ladies, gather around.

15:04.270 --> 15:09.542
Joining us this week, we have
two extra-special guest judges.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.110
You know and love her

15:11.110 --> 15:13.346
from the television show
"Community,"

15:13.346 --> 15:18.718
the shilarious Yvette
Nicole Brown will be here.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.286
[cheers and applause]

15:20.286 --> 15:23.122
And you know and love her
from "Saturday Night Live."

15:24.223 --> 15:25.458
Cecily Strong will be here.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.260
[cheers and applause]

15:27.260 --> 15:30.630
Now, in a few moments
you'll meet Cecily,

15:30.630 --> 15:33.666
who will help you
punch up your material

15:33.666 --> 15:35.501
so you kill it tomorrow.

15:35.501 --> 15:37.703
Good luck,

15:37.703 --> 15:42.074
and don't fuck it up.

15:42.074 --> 15:43.509
By-ee.

15:43.509 --> 15:44.911
- Bye.
- Bye, Ru.

15:46.279 --> 15:49.448
Oh. Oh, my God.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.818
- It's Cecily Strong. Hello.
- Monét X Change.

15:51.818 --> 15:52.819
It's a pleasure to meet you.

15:52.819 --> 15:55.288
It's very much my pleasure.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.223
Today we are working
with Cecily Strong,

15:57.223 --> 15:58.791
and she is legendary, girl.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.593
I live for Miss Cecily.

16:00.593 --> 16:03.462
So, Monét,
you're doing your roast,

16:03.462 --> 16:05.064
- your Ru-eulogy.
- Yeah.

16:05.064 --> 16:06.799
Let's hear
where you're starting.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.101
Lady Bunny dabbled
as a magician's assistant,

16:09.101 --> 16:10.970
where she bragged
about achieving

16:10.970 --> 16:13.272
one of the greatest
disappearing acts of all time:

16:13.272 --> 16:14.307
her waistline.

16:16.275 --> 16:17.510
There's got to be--

16:17.510 --> 16:19.078
there's something better
to be a magician's--

16:19.078 --> 16:20.780
I mean, magicians are freaks.

16:20.780 --> 16:23.950
I think the more unexpected
I think always works better.

16:23.950 --> 16:25.051
Better.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.853
I mean, even if you do
a weight joke,

16:26.853 --> 16:28.487
I think that's fine,

16:28.487 --> 16:30.823
especially in drag world
where big is beautiful.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.459
- Yeah.
- And it's nowhere else.

16:33.459 --> 16:35.194
- [laughs]
- That's not my opinion.

16:35.194 --> 16:36.229
That's society.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.964
I've been pregnant
for six years.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.866
[laughs]

16:39.866 --> 16:41.467
And you're very nice
naturally,

16:41.467 --> 16:45.071
so I think that you can get away
with a bit more, because--

16:45.071 --> 16:47.540
- I'm Miss Congeniality.
- Exactly. Yes.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.275
Lady Bunny
was born in Tennessee,

16:49.275 --> 16:51.510
but developed her appetite
for black dick

16:51.510 --> 16:53.312
when she met RuPaul in Atlanta.

16:53.312 --> 16:54.513
[laughs]
That's great.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.848
Working with Cecily is great.

16:55.848 --> 16:56.983
She gives me great advice

16:56.983 --> 16:59.085
about what I can make
a little stronger

16:59.085 --> 17:02.255
and where I can take a little
more time for jokes to land.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.456
I'm going to be so funny,

17:03.456 --> 17:04.857
Lady Bunny's going
to turn over in her grave,

17:04.857 --> 17:08.160
resurrect,
and slap the shit out of me.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.463
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.831
Oh!

17:11.831 --> 17:13.165
[laughs]

17:13.165 --> 17:14.433
Nice to meet you.
How are you?

17:14.433 --> 17:16.502
I am really nervous.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.005
I feel very out of my element,

17:19.005 --> 17:21.073
and I would love
to use this time

17:21.073 --> 17:24.010
to get as much help
that I can from you.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.711
Well, let's hear
what you have.

17:25.711 --> 17:29.048
I have three jokes.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.850
Okay, you probably need more.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.818
Okay. All right.

17:32.818 --> 17:35.688
Lady Bunny
is an inbred pig in a wig.

17:35.688 --> 17:38.724
[laughs]
You started very harsh.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.259
There are a lot of people,
when they do roasts,

17:40.259 --> 17:41.961
it comes off as mean,

17:41.961 --> 17:44.564
so we just have to find
how you approach this.

17:44.564 --> 17:48.768
Well, I just imagined her
being like a roast, like...

17:48.768 --> 17:49.869
[laughs]

17:49.869 --> 17:51.270
You know,
like with the apple.

17:51.270 --> 17:53.172
Right. I think like
that movement was funnier

17:53.172 --> 17:56.242
than coming out and going
she's a big fat pig.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.077
You just have
to soften it somehow.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.747
So even if that's--if you
just say it like you're so sad.

18:01.747 --> 18:02.782
Mm-hmm.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.884
That that inbred pig died.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.586
You know what I mean?

18:06.586 --> 18:08.220
If you're going to be rude,

18:08.220 --> 18:10.456
do it pretending that you don't
know that you're being rude.

18:10.456 --> 18:11.457
Okay. Thank you so much.

18:11.457 --> 18:13.225
- Don't get too nervous.
- Okay.

18:13.225 --> 18:14.860
I want to tickle
that pickle, honey.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.529
- Oh, wow.
- [laughs]

18:16.529 --> 18:18.798
- Thank you.
- Okay. Oh.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.801
I really want
to take the element

18:21.801 --> 18:26.739
of a traditional southern
charismatic black preacher.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.341
- Oh, that's nice.
- That's what I know.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.842
- I come from that place.
- Perfect.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.577
and all of those things.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.713
- I think that's super smart.
- Very that.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.147
I was thinking
it would start like this.

18:35.147 --> 18:37.717
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

18:37.717 --> 18:41.220
to pay some old bitch
some respect. Uh-huh.

18:41.220 --> 18:44.223
And the man on 125th said
for a bag of hot Cheetos,

18:44.223 --> 18:48.227
she would give you the yum-yum,
ooh-ah sensation,

18:48.227 --> 18:50.863
but yet you would come back
with a burning sensation.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.765
- I'm liking all of this.
- Okay, well, good.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.000
- This is the other one.
- And I would say

18:54.000 --> 18:55.134
make sure you leave space...

18:55.134 --> 18:56.569
- Room to laugh.
- ...for laughs.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.405
Uh-huh. Now, I also have--

18:59.405 --> 19:01.941
Now, this is where I need
a little finesse.

19:01.941 --> 19:06.379
I'm trying to like connect
Jonah in the belly of a whale

19:06.379 --> 19:09.015
to Lady Bunny
is shaped like a whale.

19:09.015 --> 19:11.017
Sure. I mean,
if you want to do that,

19:11.017 --> 19:12.284
I mean, you could say like,

19:12.284 --> 19:14.487
and I hope Jonah will
get out now or something--

19:14.487 --> 19:16.389
Ha!

19:16.389 --> 19:19.125
Or maybe I could say,
or I hope Ru gets out.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.192
Well, the only thing is,

19:20.192 --> 19:21.227
if you say Jonah and the whale,

19:21.227 --> 19:22.828
I think then
just keep it Jonah.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.897
Stunning. Circle.
We gonna keep that name.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.899
- Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't--
- No, you know what?

19:26.899 --> 19:28.267
I don't want to stop
what you're doing.

19:28.267 --> 19:30.269
I'm going to take
all the cues and hints,

19:30.269 --> 19:31.837
and then we gonna go pray on it,
all right?

19:31.837 --> 19:35.641
I think Monique is taking
whatever she found helpful,

19:35.641 --> 19:39.412
and whatever she didn't
find helpful doesn't matter.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.646
Yeah, I'm good.
Okay, stunning.

19:40.646 --> 19:41.681
Stunning.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.784
Do you wanna
run some jokes by me?

19:44.784 --> 19:47.820
Okay. Did you know that
doctors use a picture of Bunny

19:47.820 --> 19:50.356
to immediately cure Viagra users

19:50.356 --> 19:52.925
experiencing erections lasting
longer than four minutes?

19:52.925 --> 19:55.027
Or four hours.
Four hours.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.496
That's how long mine are.

19:57.496 --> 19:58.931
Okay.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.934
That face is not even one
a mother could love.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.637
Her parents are now vegetarian.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.672
Wait, I don't get that one.

20:06.672 --> 20:08.541
Her parents are vegetarian.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.009
But what does that
have to do with--

20:10.009 --> 20:11.744
- are you saying because of pig?
- Because her face is so ugly,

20:11.744 --> 20:13.946
like, why would you eat meat
after that?

20:15.548 --> 20:18.617
That's a confusing joke,
so don't do that one.

20:18.617 --> 20:20.820
Don't even do it.
Scratching it out.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.488
Girl, this is not good.

20:22.488 --> 20:26.826
Not good.
Abort mission, bitch.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.394
Stunt double.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.263
You can't tell,
but I'm sweating.

20:31.263 --> 20:33.966
It's the Botox,
but I'm sweating right now.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.668
Trinity needs
to go in the house

20:35.668 --> 20:37.736
and find out where
she kept the drawing board.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.773
I think she's got
some writing to do.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.044
- Well.
- Hi, how are you?

20:45.044 --> 20:47.113
Hi. What an entrance.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.581
Are you going to do a character?
Are you doing--

20:48.581 --> 20:49.849
I'm going to do me.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.618
I want to show what
Naomi Smalls' humor is like.

20:52.618 --> 20:53.886
Well, let me hear it.

20:53.886 --> 20:57.623
Death is scary,
but you know what else is scary?

20:57.623 --> 20:59.725
Bunny without bangs.

20:59.725 --> 21:03.162
She's got more lines on her
forehead than a sheet of paper.

21:03.162 --> 21:07.099
So like she was born
before Nintendo 64.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.468
[laughs] Good.
I'm into that. Yes.

21:09.468 --> 21:12.037
Obviously, like, everybody's
going to be doing age things,

21:12.037 --> 21:14.240
so you have to think about it
in a different way.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.474
Do you feel like
you have enough?

21:15.474 --> 21:16.775
- Not yet.
- Okay.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.044
Write a bunch and then
pick your best five minutes.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.045
Okay.

21:20.045 --> 21:21.180
- I guess that's obvious.
- Yeah.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.414
But I'm saying it anyway.

21:22.414 --> 21:24.517
- [laughs]
- I have some jokes,

21:24.517 --> 21:25.718
so maybe you can help me out
on some of them.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.386
Sure. Let me hear them.

21:27.386 --> 21:28.988
- I'm excited.
- Okay.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.290
So Lady Bunny was so old

21:31.290 --> 21:34.960
that she actually caused
the extinction of dinosaurs.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.029
Except the sores came

21:37.029 --> 21:38.397
from when she gave them
all cold sores,

21:38.397 --> 21:39.899
and that's why
they went extinct.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.770
I think the second part
of the joke was stronger.

21:44.770 --> 21:47.039
The sores part
is the funny part.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.040
- Right.
- Okay.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.175
Sores are hilarious.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.746
Some of the people here
are just here

21:53.746 --> 21:56.949
because they want to know
what she left them in her will.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.151
You could even have the will.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.553
Ooh, a prop will.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.154
And you've got the honor
of being last,

22:02.154 --> 22:03.422
so take it and own it.

22:03.422 --> 22:05.858
I don't want to like
put more pressure on you,

22:05.858 --> 22:07.226
but you have a big job
ahead of you.

22:07.226 --> 22:08.627
So take tonight,

22:08.627 --> 22:11.030
and figure out
how do you end this funeral.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.965
How do I end this?

22:12.965 --> 22:15.034
It's really easy.
Just make it really funny.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.369
Cool.

22:17.369 --> 22:18.904
You can be funny in real life,

22:18.904 --> 22:23.242
and totally bomb when it comes
to performing on stage.

22:23.242 --> 22:25.911
And I'm really nervous that I'm
going to have a little fuck-up

22:25.911 --> 22:28.380
and the girls are gonna
taste that blood in the water,

22:28.380 --> 22:30.282
and they're gonna just attack
and get me off.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.788
Here we are.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.923
The sponge and the broom.

22:37.923 --> 22:41.260
Hello?
It's me, Villain-tina.

22:41.260 --> 22:42.795
Villain-tina, girl.

22:44.496 --> 22:47.533
All right, ladies,
I will not be talking today,

22:47.533 --> 22:49.535
because I'm going to get ready.

22:49.535 --> 22:52.571
Today is the day of the roast,

22:52.571 --> 22:54.773
and it's a tense situation

22:54.773 --> 22:57.943
because I have to get my script
done while getting ready.

22:57.943 --> 23:02.514
I've yet to have really done a
full run-through of everything,

23:02.514 --> 23:05.384
and my funny bone is exhausted.

23:08.420 --> 23:09.555
Whose is this?

23:09.555 --> 23:12.057
It looks like Latrice's
cover-up thingy.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.093
Maybe since you couldn't
save her, she left you that.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.296
Girl.

23:17.296 --> 23:18.697
Speaking of eliminations, y'all,

23:18.697 --> 23:20.866
like, now that it's getting,
like, to the nitty-gritty,

23:20.866 --> 23:22.701
has anybody changed
their mindset

23:22.701 --> 23:24.169
on how they're going to judge?

23:24.169 --> 23:27.973
No, I think I'm still going to
do it based on the report card.

23:27.973 --> 23:30.676
That's a good way
when it's obvious,

23:30.676 --> 23:32.544
but at this point,
it's getting to a point

23:32.544 --> 23:34.213
where we don't know, you know,

23:34.213 --> 23:38.917
is someone in the bottom safe,
or in the top?

23:38.917 --> 23:40.753
Or did you win
the lip sync or not? I mean--

23:40.753 --> 23:41.987
Are they your best friend?

23:41.987 --> 23:45.357
[laughs]
Very that.

23:45.357 --> 23:47.126
I mean,
it's a really hard decision,

23:47.126 --> 23:49.662
and like honestly, I didn't want
to have to make that decision.

23:49.662 --> 23:52.431
When I found out that I was
in the top, I was devastated,

23:52.431 --> 23:55.367
because I knew my friend
was going to be in the bottom.

23:55.367 --> 23:56.969
And it didn't have
anything to do

23:56.969 --> 23:58.871
with me trying
to get rid of you, Monét.

23:58.871 --> 24:02.608
And it was more than just,
oh, here's her grades,

24:02.608 --> 24:04.376
here are her statistics.

24:04.376 --> 24:06.011
It was a lot more
than that for me,

24:06.011 --> 24:08.080
and that's why
it was such a hard decision.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.082
And it's going to get harder
and harder and harder

24:10.082 --> 24:11.984
because the longer
we're here with each other,

24:11.984 --> 24:14.119
the more I'm in love
with all of you.

24:16.488 --> 24:18.691
Before this conversation
with Manila,

24:18.691 --> 24:21.727
I was ready
to send her ass packing.

24:21.727 --> 24:25.097
But now I'm hearing
what she's saying,

24:25.097 --> 24:28.734
and I'm all up in my feelings,
because I get it.

24:28.734 --> 24:31.503
Sometimes I wish I could be
just like a nasty bitch.

24:31.503 --> 24:34.373
An evil, nasty cunt.

24:34.373 --> 24:36.608
Oh, can I say that on TV?
Well, I just did.

24:36.608 --> 24:40.079
You know, I don't have
the loyalties to Latrice anymore

24:40.079 --> 24:41.080
because she's not here.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.148
And, you know, going forward,

24:43.148 --> 24:47.653
I mean, I'll do it my way when
it's my turn to do it my way.

24:47.653 --> 24:51.690
That's a little nerve-wracking
for everybody,

24:51.690 --> 24:53.325
because no one really knows

24:53.325 --> 24:54.860
where they're going to stand
with you.

24:54.860 --> 24:56.128
Very that.

24:56.128 --> 25:00.265
Manila is playing
by her own set of rules.

25:00.265 --> 25:02.701
You don't know
what is going through her head,

25:02.701 --> 25:05.337
so that is kind of scary.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.905
It's kinda like being around
a crazy person.

25:06.905 --> 25:08.407
You don't know what they're
going to do next, girl.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.109
She might pull out a blade,
girl.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.477
Bye-bye, silicone.

Many know her as Lady Bunny,

drag name, Methuselah.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.693
in my time of need.

28:14.693 --> 28:18.564
I cracked a nail,
and these are French tip.

28:21.166 --> 28:24.202
Bunny is dead.

28:24.202 --> 28:26.905
I personally blame Ru.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.943
She created this mess.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.578
But I understand.

28:32.578 --> 28:35.747
Everyone needs
that one ugly friend.

28:35.747 --> 28:38.317
Isn't that right, Valentina?

28:39.585 --> 28:42.387
She's ugly on the inside, too.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.956
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

28:43.956 --> 28:48.193
Bunny does have
that special kind of face.

28:48.193 --> 28:50.829
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

28:50.829 --> 28:58.403
Doctors use a picture of her
to solve Viagra users with--

28:58.403 --> 29:00.439
to solve Viagra users

29:00.439 --> 29:02.908
with erections
lasting longer than four hours.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.411
Is this the same Trinity
from Snatch Game?

29:06.411 --> 29:08.714
Wish they would have solved
that joke, bitch. Whew.

29:08.714 --> 29:10.248
Trinity should have just
brought Caitlyn Jenner back

29:10.248 --> 29:11.283
to do this roast.

Praise the Lord, saints.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.354
Praise the Lord.

29:15.354 --> 29:16.521
I said praise the Lord,
saints.

we're gathered here today

29:24.630 --> 29:26.565
with heavy hearts

29:26.565 --> 29:30.102
and with full indigestion

29:30.102 --> 29:34.573
over our dear sister's
departure.

29:34.573 --> 29:38.677

Oh, I'm reminded of the story

29:48.954 --> 29:51.323
of Jonah and the whale.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.659
And how Jonah was gonna get out

29:53.659 --> 29:56.728
of this big beached whale
right here.

29:56.728 --> 30:00.532
And I do believe from all
the loads she has taken,

30:00.532 --> 30:03.068
she might even be a sperm whale.

30:03.068 --> 30:07.939
So my question
to you tonight, Jonah.

30:07.939 --> 30:11.009
Jonah, can you hear me?

30:11.009 --> 30:13.512

All right,
let's get into this.

30:30.228 --> 30:33.298
Ah. We are here
to honor someone

30:33.298 --> 30:37.903
who had no problem offending
literally everybody.

30:37.903 --> 30:40.439
And I think
that came with confidence.

30:40.439 --> 30:43.909
And confidence comes with age.

30:43.909 --> 30:45.377
And we know how the bitch died.

30:45.377 --> 30:53.452
From old, old, old, old,
old age.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.422
Gosh, could you imagine

30:57.422 --> 31:00.892
being born in a time
with no Nintendo 64?

31:03.261 --> 31:07.733
And it's really cute to me
that Ru, you and Lady Bunny

31:07.733 --> 31:09.801
went to the same wood shop
to get your teeth done.

31:09.801 --> 31:14.005

in 1832.

31:15.907 --> 31:17.175

31:17.175 --> 31:19.845
It's very awkward
to see Naomi bomb like this.

31:19.845 --> 31:21.646
What is really making this weird

31:21.646 --> 31:25.517
is her laughing at her awkward
pauses and her awkward jokes.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.987
She says a joke,
and it's like ha-ha-ha-ha.

31:28.987 --> 31:31.623
It's like
that makes it even worse.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.859

at a hotdog-eating contest.

33:17.762 --> 33:18.997

33:18.997 --> 33:22.500

performed the autopsy,

they found that
she was full of seamen,

33:24.836 --> 33:27.339

Gladiator.

39:24.996 --> 39:27.232
[all laugh]

39:27.232 --> 39:31.035
I'm serving angelic fresco
on the ceiling of a church.

39:31.035 --> 39:35.039
I'm giving you Aphrodite,
cherubs, and baroque arts.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.575
I feel like I'm serving legs
for days

39:37.575 --> 39:41.679
and blonde bombshell
Grecian fantasy.

39:41.679 --> 39:44.816
If you don't like my angelic
look, then I'll see you in hell.

39:44.816 --> 39:48.253
That bell
cherubs me the wrong way.

39:48.253 --> 39:50.154
Oh, she's having twins.

39:50.154 --> 39:51.256
[all laugh]

39:51.256 --> 39:53.458
♪ She's a super queen ♪

39:53.458 --> 39:54.826
Welcome, ladies.

39:54.826 --> 39:56.427
It's time
for the judges' critiques,

39:56.427 --> 40:00.665
starting with Monét X Change.

40:00.665 --> 40:03.167
When you came out, the first
thing I wrote was fierce,

40:03.167 --> 40:04.936
and then I wrote fearless.

40:04.936 --> 40:06.337
And that's what I got

40:06.337 --> 40:08.873
from the whole time that you
were speaking about Lady Bunny.

40:08.873 --> 40:10.775
- Girl, you were funny.
- Thank you.

40:10.775 --> 40:12.810
It was a joy to watch you,

40:12.810 --> 40:15.346
because you had the audience
in the palm of your hand,

40:15.346 --> 40:16.581
because you came out strong

40:16.581 --> 40:18.483
and every single time
you delivered.

40:18.483 --> 40:20.251
You had so many jokes.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.054
Just in terms of hard jokes,
you had the most tonight.

40:23.054 --> 40:25.790
And I thought
you were not just reciting them,

40:25.790 --> 40:27.625
you were still staying present

40:27.625 --> 40:29.527
to bounce off what was
happening in the moment.

40:29.527 --> 40:30.928
Just so many good jokes.

40:30.928 --> 40:32.664
- Thank you.
- I'm jealous.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.032
Sometimes when it comes
to the main stage,

40:34.032 --> 40:36.134
I worry about Monét X Change,
I'm not going to lie.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.770
Tonight you have elevated
your look.

40:38.770 --> 40:42.640
This is a beautiful
interpretation of angelic white.

40:42.640 --> 40:45.343
The beadwork is extraordinary.
It fits your body.

40:45.343 --> 40:47.879
The headpiece,
the inclusion of hair.

40:47.879 --> 40:50.715
You almost rented your own
runway back there, the train.

40:50.715 --> 40:52.684
It was just all
really beautiful.

40:52.684 --> 40:55.119
- Thank you.
- I'm proud of you, Monét.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.120
Thank you, Michelle.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.322
Keep it up.
Don't let me down.

40:57.322 --> 41:00.725
- I will not.
- Up next, Trinity The Tuck.

41:00.725 --> 41:04.228
This outfit
is Las motherfucking Vegas.

41:04.228 --> 41:05.897
This is Paris, France.

41:05.897 --> 41:08.433
This is the top level of drag.

41:08.433 --> 41:09.834
You're doing it right here
and right now.

41:09.834 --> 41:11.369
- Thank you.
- Yes.

41:11.369 --> 41:13.071
There's always the queen,
each season,

41:13.071 --> 41:14.806
that I get excited,
edge of my seat

41:14.806 --> 41:16.474
to see how she's going
to hit the runway.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.209
You're that queen
in "All Stars" 4 for me.

41:18.209 --> 41:19.277
Thank you.

41:19.277 --> 41:21.179
But let's talk about
the challenge.

41:21.179 --> 41:23.181
I think you were so caught up

41:23.181 --> 41:24.816
in the "this joke,
then this joke,

41:24.816 --> 41:26.484
and I'm looking here,"

41:26.484 --> 41:29.387
that your timing got off
and you lost the crowd.

41:29.387 --> 41:32.123
I think you overthought it.

41:32.123 --> 41:34.225
I know you can do better
than what you did.

41:34.225 --> 41:35.293
Thank you.

41:35.293 --> 41:38.096
Up next, Monique Heart.

41:38.096 --> 41:41.733
The look tonight, what is that
plastic-looking material?

41:41.733 --> 41:42.734
- What is that?
- They're blinds.

41:42.734 --> 41:44.135
Huh.

41:44.135 --> 41:45.903
You know, blinds
are supposed to throw shade.

41:45.903 --> 41:47.338
I'm not going to do that.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.741
You're the only queen
who did a character.

41:49.741 --> 41:51.175
I said praise the Lord,
saints.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.577
Praise the Lord.

41:52.577 --> 41:53.978
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:53.978 --> 41:55.146
Had you done
that character before?

41:55.146 --> 41:56.180
No.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.782
- First time.
- First time.

41:57.782 --> 41:59.083
Well, it worked for me.

41:59.083 --> 42:01.285
Where it had issues

42:01.285 --> 42:03.454
was because there was so much
after one another

42:03.454 --> 42:05.523
and it was constantly
at the same pitch,

42:05.523 --> 42:06.724
we lost some of those jokes.

42:06.724 --> 42:09.026
You had some funny things
in there.

42:09.026 --> 42:13.164
I'm a church girl,
so I really was the amen corner

42:13.164 --> 42:14.232
the whole time
you were doing it.

42:14.232 --> 42:15.600
It was biblically sound.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.435
All of it
was just right in the Bible,

42:17.435 --> 42:18.836
so I was like, yes.

42:18.836 --> 42:20.338
And I just thought
it was really funny.

42:20.338 --> 42:23.107
I thought you really
engaged the crowd.

42:23.107 --> 42:24.108
You went for it.

42:24.108 --> 42:25.977
Those big bouncing titties.

42:25.977 --> 42:27.512
It was all so great.

42:27.512 --> 42:32.049
And your head is so beautiful,
I could cry.

42:32.049 --> 42:36.187
Up next, the artist formerly
known as Naomi Smalls.

42:36.187 --> 42:37.622
Hi, judges.

42:37.622 --> 42:40.124
You were Prince
when you walked out.

42:40.124 --> 42:41.526
Only thing different
is you got legs for days.

42:41.526 --> 42:43.661
Everything else was Prince.

42:43.661 --> 42:45.463
Let's talk about
the challenge.

42:45.463 --> 42:47.432
- Okay.
- This was a little rough.

42:47.432 --> 42:49.567
I just didn't feel like
you were comfortable.

42:49.567 --> 42:52.236
I felt like 90% of your jokes
were about age.

42:52.236 --> 42:56.474
Old, old, old, old.

42:56.474 --> 42:58.176
- It got old.
- [laughs]

42:58.176 --> 43:00.445
I was trying to go with more
of the millennial approach

43:00.445 --> 43:02.280
because I was kind of the only
one here who could do it.

43:02.280 --> 43:03.981
Um...

43:03.981 --> 43:05.450
Shade, shade.

43:05.450 --> 43:07.051
[all laugh]

43:07.051 --> 43:10.188
If you were giving more
to that obnoxious character,

43:10.188 --> 43:11.956
I think that
would have helped you.

43:11.956 --> 43:13.124
Bigger is always better.

43:13.124 --> 43:14.859
[chuckles]

43:14.859 --> 43:16.861
Up next, Valentina.

43:16.861 --> 43:20.798
You are just the most
beautiful, sparkling,

43:20.798 --> 43:22.934
strangest little bird.

43:22.934 --> 43:26.337
I think you just kind of
do your own thing,

43:26.337 --> 43:27.638
and it's fun to watch.

43:27.638 --> 43:29.373
Thank you.

43:29.373 --> 43:32.343
On the runway,
you looked beautiful.

43:32.343 --> 43:35.012
White and gold just look really
beautiful on your skin.

43:35.012 --> 43:37.415
It's just a great
color palette for you.

43:37.415 --> 43:42.854
At the funeral, there wasn't
much in the joke realm.

43:42.854 --> 43:44.522
You had some moments.

43:44.522 --> 43:46.691
I'm not sure they were the
movements that were intended.

43:46.691 --> 43:48.593
We just laugh at you
because you're likeable.

43:48.593 --> 43:50.561
It just wasn't very funny.

43:50.561 --> 43:53.331
I had an issue with you
in the challenge.

43:53.331 --> 43:54.966
You didn't have eye makeup on.

43:54.966 --> 43:58.536
I honestly ran out of time
with my makeup.

43:58.536 --> 43:59.837
If I would have
continued my makeup,

43:59.837 --> 44:02.607
I wouldn't have had a full set.

44:02.607 --> 44:05.443
I still wish your eyes
had been done.

44:06.544 --> 44:08.846
Up next, Manila Luzon.

44:08.846 --> 44:10.481
♪ Ahh ♪

44:10.481 --> 44:12.917
Manila,
you had a great entrance.

44:12.917 --> 44:16.787
And once you peeked through
the little blinds and recoiled,

44:16.787 --> 44:20.725
I was like I'm so here for
whatever this is about to be.

44:20.725 --> 44:23.261
I really, really,
really enjoyed it.

44:23.261 --> 44:25.496
You were gold.

44:25.496 --> 44:29.767
You know, roasts are
all about go big or go home.

44:29.767 --> 44:32.537
And with me, the harder,
the better, baby,

44:32.537 --> 44:34.338
and you went hard.

44:34.338 --> 44:35.673
It was a mic drop.

44:35.673 --> 44:36.707
Thank you.

44:36.707 --> 44:38.209
All of the jokes were great.

44:38.209 --> 44:40.578
Your delivery
was really fantastic.

44:40.578 --> 44:42.280
And you looked great.

44:42.280 --> 44:44.048
You remind me of, like,

44:44.048 --> 44:46.083
what I wanted to look like
in eighth grade.

44:46.083 --> 44:48.286
[all laugh]

44:48.286 --> 44:51.556
The runway tonight, you know,
this could look very costume-y.

44:51.556 --> 44:54.258
But the small details
that make it tasteful,

44:54.258 --> 44:58.396
like the shoes, like the hair,
are just really well done.

44:58.396 --> 44:59.830
Good week for you.

44:59.830 --> 45:02.533
And in this competition, this is
a good time to build momentum.

45:02.533 --> 45:03.534
Thank you.

45:03.534 --> 45:05.570
Thank you, ladies.

45:05.570 --> 45:10.608
Based on your performances
in the roast and on the runway,

45:10.608 --> 45:12.577
I've made some decisions.

45:13.744 --> 45:16.147
Manila Luzon.

45:18.349 --> 45:20.618
Monét X Change.

45:20.618 --> 45:21.786
Con-drag-ulations.

45:21.786 --> 45:23.888
You are the top two All Stars
of the week.

45:23.888 --> 45:27.325
[applause]

45:29.527 --> 45:34.265
You've each won a $3.000
gift card from MuLondon,

45:34.265 --> 45:39.904
and a wig wardrobe
from Rock Star Wigs.

45:39.904 --> 45:41.672
Merkins included.

45:41.672 --> 45:43.107
[all laugh]

45:43.107 --> 45:46.944
Ladies, this week
if you're not in the top,

45:46.944 --> 45:48.879
you're in the bottom.

45:51.382 --> 45:54.719
I have died and gone to hell.

45:58.055 --> 46:02.793
Manila, Monét,
each of you needs to decide

46:02.793 --> 46:05.930
which of the bottom queens
you'll eliminate

46:05.930 --> 46:08.332
if you win the lip sync.

46:10.701 --> 46:13.037
Thank you, ladies.
You may leave the stage.

46:20.277 --> 46:21.445
Where's the drinks, honey?

46:21.445 --> 46:24.815
When Ru says
I'm in the top two,

46:24.815 --> 46:26.851
I'm ecstatic,
because this week,

46:26.851 --> 46:29.220
if you're not in the top,
you're in the bottom.

46:29.220 --> 46:30.254
And with Manila
pulling lip syncs, girl,

46:30.254 --> 46:32.423
who knows what she's gonna do.

46:32.423 --> 46:34.158
She might send RuPaul home.

46:34.158 --> 46:35.593
We don't know
what she's gonna do.

46:35.593 --> 46:40.097
I mean, I don't even know
how, like, to even feel.

46:40.097 --> 46:42.233
However you judge
is up to you.

46:42.233 --> 46:44.568
My track record
speaks for itself.

46:44.568 --> 46:46.637
I've been in the top twice,

46:46.637 --> 46:48.673
and this is my first time
in the bottom.

46:48.673 --> 46:52.076
You can take that and make your
judgment based off that or not.

46:52.076 --> 46:54.745
Being in the top twice,

46:54.745 --> 46:56.881
this technically makes
my second time in the bottom,

46:56.881 --> 46:58.315
which really, really sucks.

46:58.315 --> 47:00.718
However, I feel like
I delivered and I showed up

47:00.718 --> 47:02.953
and I'm going to continue
to do that.

47:02.953 --> 47:04.455
And you have been safe.

47:04.455 --> 47:08.159
And I have been safe, safe,
safe, safe, safe, safe, safe.

47:09.627 --> 47:11.529
The queens
who are in the bottom

47:11.529 --> 47:12.930
are all of a sudden realizing

47:12.930 --> 47:16.967
that the numbers aren't actually
working out in their favor.

47:16.967 --> 47:18.369
If you're going by report cards,

47:18.369 --> 47:21.138
everyone's GPA
kind of averages out.

47:21.138 --> 47:25.276
So where's being fair
going to take you now?

47:25.276 --> 47:26.544
How do you feel, V?

47:26.544 --> 47:29.780
I've been in the bottom once,

47:29.780 --> 47:32.249
and that was with Gia Gunn
for Snatch Game

47:32.249 --> 47:35.453
for something I didn't feel I
needed to be in the bottom for.

47:35.453 --> 47:37.722
I didn't agree with that bottom,

47:37.722 --> 47:39.357
and I don't agree again.

47:39.357 --> 47:40.691
I've been doing very well.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.860
During this challenge,

47:42.860 --> 47:45.329
all of those judges
were laughing at my jokes.

47:45.329 --> 47:47.331
Can't you just see her now

47:47.331 --> 47:50.368
with the big juicy
red apple in her mouth

47:50.368 --> 47:52.837
and Satan's finger up her ass?

47:52.837 --> 47:54.872
[RuPaul laughs]

47:54.872 --> 47:56.240
I don't understand.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.442
They did say
that they weren't sure

47:58.442 --> 48:01.679
if they were laughing with you
or basically at you.

48:01.679 --> 48:03.047
They were laughing.

48:03.047 --> 48:07.618
You are delusional
if you think that you did good,

48:07.618 --> 48:08.786
because I was there.

48:08.786 --> 48:10.121
I wasn't the worst.

48:10.121 --> 48:13.157
I don't find myself deserving
of going home right now.

48:13.157 --> 48:15.559
I've been doing so well
in this competition.

48:15.559 --> 48:16.894
Who do you think
was the worst?

48:16.894 --> 48:18.429
I think it would have been...

48:20.264 --> 48:22.066
Monique or Naomi this week.

48:22.066 --> 48:24.335
Based on the reaction.

48:24.335 --> 48:26.137
- Reaction?
- Of the judges.

48:26.137 --> 48:29.774
Man, how the fuck you think
I deserve to be in the bottom?

48:29.774 --> 48:32.643
The bitch is delusional,

48:32.643 --> 48:35.146
so I hope she gets chopped.

48:35.146 --> 48:37.381
Well, maybe we should talk
with some of you guys.

48:37.381 --> 48:39.450
Whatever you guys need
from us, just let us know.

48:39.450 --> 48:40.518
I really don't need to have

48:40.518 --> 48:41.952
a one-on-one conversation
with you.

48:41.952 --> 48:43.254
I'm not trying to go home.

48:43.254 --> 48:45.356
I just won last week and thought
I was winning this week.

48:45.356 --> 48:47.358
Very that.

48:47.358 --> 48:48.726
How are you feeling right now?

48:48.726 --> 48:52.096
I feel, obviously, happy
to be, you know, at the top.

48:52.096 --> 48:55.533
But it is, like, a very hard
decision to fucking make,

48:55.533 --> 48:56.667
you know what I mean?

48:56.667 --> 48:58.002
I mean, my heart is like--

48:58.002 --> 48:59.703
You know, right now,
I'm like, silly boy,

48:59.703 --> 49:00.738
what the hell's happening?

49:00.738 --> 49:02.406
Girl, it fucking sucks.

49:02.406 --> 49:03.541
I've never been in the bottom,

49:03.541 --> 49:06.010
and this is not
a cute place to be.

49:06.010 --> 49:07.611
Trust and believe,
I know that.

49:07.611 --> 49:10.214
The fact that
I've never been in the top two

49:10.214 --> 49:12.783
is scary as fuck.

49:12.783 --> 49:16.754
But I've been consistent and
safe this entire competition,

49:16.754 --> 49:19.824
so I hope that
my performance prior to this

49:19.824 --> 49:21.158
is being factored in

49:21.158 --> 49:22.693
when it comes to
the decision making

49:22.693 --> 49:24.028
on who's going to stay.

49:25.429 --> 49:28.032
If you were in my place,
like, what would you--

49:28.032 --> 49:29.400
I would eliminate Valentina.

49:31.001 --> 49:32.970
I mean, this is Naomi's
first time being on the bottom.

49:32.970 --> 49:34.171
It's my first time
being in the bottom.

49:34.171 --> 49:35.539
Monique has had two wins.

49:35.539 --> 49:37.608
To me,
that's a clear path to me.

49:37.608 --> 49:40.511
Trinity has proven that
she is a fabulous performer.

49:40.511 --> 49:43.214
She's been in the top two
a couple times,

49:43.214 --> 49:46.083
and she's fierce competition.

49:46.083 --> 49:47.785
So maybe I should
get rid of her now,

49:47.785 --> 49:50.855
so I don't have to worry about
her getting rid of me later.

49:50.855 --> 49:53.424
I want to be here so bad.

49:53.424 --> 49:54.959
I have so much more to show.

49:54.959 --> 49:56.393
You know, it sucks.

49:56.393 --> 49:59.196
You've been here to make the
decision about who goes home.

49:59.196 --> 50:01.298
My biggest suggestion would be

50:01.298 --> 50:05.269
trust your criteria
the way your mind works.

50:05.269 --> 50:07.805
Be fair. Do the right thing.

50:07.805 --> 50:10.975
With that being said,
it shouldn't be me. I know it.

50:10.975 --> 50:13.410
Yeah. Valentina
was someone I was like

50:13.410 --> 50:15.546
she is going to a frontrunner.

50:15.546 --> 50:17.014
From day one,
she entered the workroom.

50:17.014 --> 50:20.184
I was like top four
Valentina, down.

50:20.184 --> 50:22.119
She's just not turning it out.

50:23.487 --> 50:26.490
Oh, my God, this is not
where I expected you to be.

50:26.490 --> 50:28.092
Me either.

50:28.092 --> 50:30.928
But I'm really proud
of what I've done here.

50:30.928 --> 50:33.230
And I think that I keep growing
with every challenge,

50:33.230 --> 50:34.365
and keep learning.

50:34.365 --> 50:37.201
And I want to keep competing.

50:37.201 --> 50:39.770
I think I'm
a really good competitor.

50:39.770 --> 50:43.007
Naomi made top three
on her season,

50:43.007 --> 50:44.708
so I know she has what it takes

50:44.708 --> 50:46.544
to come and slay
this competition.

50:46.544 --> 50:49.079
But recently, Naomi has been

50:49.079 --> 50:50.748
really fading
into the background.

50:50.748 --> 50:53.284
So maybe this is her time?

50:54.785 --> 50:57.621
[sighs] Um...

50:57.621 --> 50:59.023
Manila's a wild card.

50:59.023 --> 51:00.457
I don't know.

51:00.457 --> 51:02.126
I think there's a fair way
to judge this.

51:02.126 --> 51:04.595
I'm confident if Monét wins
I'll stay.

51:04.595 --> 51:06.730
I'm not so confident
with Manila.

51:06.730 --> 51:09.566
I don't know,
but I am trigged

51:09.566 --> 51:11.936
to the motherfucker.

51:14.271 --> 51:18.609
You want to be
the Venezuelan Barbie, great.

51:18.609 --> 51:21.745
But you take three hours
to paint the same face,

51:21.745 --> 51:23.247
and unless you're doing
a character,

51:23.247 --> 51:25.082
there's no personality.

51:25.082 --> 51:26.450
She needs to go home.

51:26.450 --> 51:28.986
Like I want her to get chopped.

51:28.986 --> 51:33.490
I am so proud of how
I've done and where I'm going.

51:33.490 --> 51:36.660
I'm not the kind of person
that wants to ever come off

51:36.660 --> 51:39.296
as desperately
begging to stay, please.

51:39.296 --> 51:41.098
The power's in your hands.

51:41.098 --> 51:43.200
No, that's not fierce.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.935
That's not a star.

51:44.935 --> 51:46.170
Like I said last time,

51:46.170 --> 51:48.639
I can't wait to be
in that top with you, girl.

51:48.639 --> 51:52.743
To be holding your hand like two
Miss Potential Universe.

51:52.743 --> 51:56.981
I think Valentina might have
a distorted perception

51:56.981 --> 51:59.516
of her performances recently.

51:59.516 --> 52:02.519
Like, going home is not part
of my fantasy, either,

52:02.519 --> 52:05.622
but we have to look at reality,
not fantasy right now.

52:06.924 --> 52:08.926
- You want $10.000?
- [laughs]

52:08.926 --> 52:11.795
- Do you want $10.000?
- Bitch.

52:11.795 --> 52:13.130
Because this is like a--

52:13.130 --> 52:14.365
This is a hard decision
to make.

52:14.365 --> 52:16.934
It's a very hard
decision to make.

52:19.937 --> 52:24.375
In picking the lipstick, I
want to be as fair as possible,

52:24.375 --> 52:25.609
and I want to make a decision

52:25.609 --> 52:28.145
that when I rest my head
on my pillow tonight,

52:28.145 --> 52:31.215
that I feel okay
with the decision I made.

52:31.215 --> 52:33.751
It's going to be the person
who I think did the worst today,

52:33.751 --> 52:37.755
and who, by their track record,
deserves to go home.

52:37.755 --> 52:39.356
I love all four of these girls,

52:39.356 --> 52:41.392
and it's a very hard decision
to make,

52:41.392 --> 52:43.227
but one that has to be done.

52:43.227 --> 52:47.631
It's time to decide
who I will send home.

52:47.631 --> 52:50.501
And I still don't even know
who I'm going to pick

52:50.501 --> 52:52.336
walking up to this box.

52:52.336 --> 52:56.740
Last week was
an emotional decision for me,

52:56.740 --> 52:58.709
but it wasn't
a hard decision for me.

52:58.709 --> 53:00.277
This is really hard.

53:00.277 --> 53:02.946
I don't want to have the same
backlash that I did last week.

53:02.946 --> 53:07.584
But I'm here to win the crown
and win the money,

53:07.584 --> 53:10.454
and I need to do
what's best for my own game.

53:15.626 --> 53:17.127
Welcome back, ladies.

53:17.127 --> 53:20.764
Two top All Stars
stand before me.

53:20.764 --> 53:23.767
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me,

53:23.767 --> 53:26.703
win $10.000,

53:26.703 --> 53:28.338
and earn the power

53:28.338 --> 53:32.209
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop.

53:34.278 --> 53:35.379
The time has come...
[thunder]

53:35.379 --> 53:37.347
for you to lip sync

53:37.347 --> 53:43.020
[echoing] for your legacy.

53:43.020 --> 53:44.922
Good luck,

53:44.922 --> 53:48.058
and don't fuck it up.

Ladies,
I've made my decision.

55:54.351 --> 55:56.320
Manila Luzon.

55:57.754 --> 56:00.891
Con-drag-ulations.
You're a winner, baby.

56:00.891 --> 56:02.159
Thank you.

56:02.159 --> 56:05.562
[applause]

56:08.365 --> 56:09.600
Monét X Change.

56:11.635 --> 56:15.505
Con-drag-ulations.
You're also a winner, baby.

56:15.505 --> 56:18.041
[applause]

56:18.041 --> 56:19.876
Ru, thank you.

56:19.876 --> 56:24.681
You've each earned
a cash tip of $5.000.

56:24.681 --> 56:27.217
[applause]

56:27.217 --> 56:30.487
Will the bottom queens
please step forward.

56:34.391 --> 56:36.460
So this makes two.

56:36.460 --> 56:37.661
Are we sending
two girls home

56:37.661 --> 56:39.596
- or did we pick the same girl?
- Oh, my God.

56:39.596 --> 56:41.899
America,
that's two lipsticks,

56:41.899 --> 56:44.768
which means we could have
two people getting the chop.

56:48.939 --> 56:50.540
Manila,

56:50.540 --> 56:52.909
Monét,

56:52.909 --> 56:58.081
with great power
comes great responsibility.

56:59.850 --> 57:01.151
I should know.

57:02.619 --> 57:05.956
For tonight...

57:05.956 --> 57:07.658
no one is going home.

57:07.658 --> 57:09.226
Oh.

57:09.226 --> 57:12.129
[laughs] Thank God.

57:12.129 --> 57:14.364
Cue the slime.

57:17.034 --> 57:20.304
For the first time
in "Drag Race" herstory,

57:20.304 --> 57:25.142
"All Star" rules are suspended

57:25.142 --> 57:27.544
until further notice.

57:29.079 --> 57:31.248
Oh, my God.

57:37.854 --> 57:41.925
Ladies, please return
to the workroom

57:41.925 --> 57:44.261
and wait
for further instructions.

57:46.296 --> 57:48.765
You may leave the stage.

57:48.765 --> 57:50.967
She ain't gotta tell me twice.

57:50.967 --> 57:52.035
[all laugh]

57:52.035 --> 57:53.837
Bye, ladies.

57:59.176 --> 58:01.645
Bitch, what is the T?

58:01.645 --> 58:04.548
I'm so confused.

58:04.548 --> 58:07.084
- Maybe.
- Uh-oh.

58:07.084 --> 58:12.055
"Get ready
to lip sync for your life."

58:12.055 --> 58:15.025
"Life, life, life, life."

58:15.025 --> 58:16.727
Oh, my God. So they're
going back to old way.

58:16.727 --> 58:19.329
Back to the old rules.
No lipstick legacy.

58:19.329 --> 58:20.797
It's lip sync for your life.

58:20.797 --> 58:22.499
She was done
giving out them tips.

58:22.499 --> 58:24.968
Girl, she was like we will
not have another Shangela

58:24.968 --> 58:27.304
in the name of Jesus.

58:27.304 --> 58:28.538
Boo!

58:28.538 --> 58:30.107
[all scream]

58:30.107 --> 58:31.408
Guess who's back.

58:31.408 --> 58:34.511
No! Hey,
I thought she was dead.

58:34.511 --> 58:36.146
No, not me.

58:36.146 --> 58:38.715
Look behind you.

58:38.715 --> 58:40.384
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

58:48.558 --> 58:52.262
Just like Jesus rose Lazarus,

58:52.262 --> 58:55.599
for some reason
he rose these horrible hos.

58:55.599 --> 58:56.833
Uh.

58:56.833 --> 58:58.068
Oh, this is gaggy.

59:06.042 --> 59:09.479
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

59:09.479 --> 59:11.581
how in the hell you gonna love

59:11.581 --> 59:15.118
a "RuPaul's Drag Race
All Stars" cliffhanger?

59:15.118 --> 59:16.720
[all laugh]

59:16.720 --> 59:18.321
Can I get an amen?

59:18.321 --> 59:20.056
- Amen.
- Amen.

59:20.056 --> 59:25.796
[evil laugh echoing]

59:29.699 --> 59:31.435
Next time on "All Stars..."

59:31.435 --> 59:33.370
If you are not shaking
in your boots right now, you--

59:33.370 --> 59:37.040
- Oh, I'm shaking.
- You will. You better.

59:37.040 --> 59:38.275
Gooped.

59:38.275 --> 59:40.744
I felt like
you were disingenuous.

59:40.744 --> 59:42.846
Ooh, girl.

59:42.846 --> 59:45.816
Let it be known
you did what you did.

59:45.816 --> 59:46.817
I think you are a little--

59:46.817 --> 59:47.818
- No, she's not.
- I'm not.

59:47.818 --> 59:49.252
You keep saying that, girl.

59:49.252 --> 59:50.287
That's not going to be
my narrative

59:50.287 --> 59:52.222
because that's not
how I feel, Gia.

59:52.222 --> 59:53.957
These bitches have got to go.

59:53.957 --> 59:56.893
Did you really feel like
I was the complete worst?

59:56.893 --> 59:58.762
- Yeah.
- Wow.

59:58.762 --> 1:00:01.598
I just wish
it could have been anyone else.

1:00:01.598 --> 1:00:04.801
For the first time
in "Drag Race" herstory,

1:00:04.801 --> 1:00:08.905
everything
is going to change forever.

1:00:08.905 --> 1:00:10.207
But why?

1:00:10.207 --> 1:00:12.776
Expect the unexpected.

1:00:12.776 --> 1:00:14.644
- [laughs]
- [snarls]

1:00:14.644 --> 1:00:16.680
