01:44.284 --> 01:47.950
Hey, Moe, you got change for a 5?

01:48.163 --> 01:50.370
Yeah, sure thing, Lenny.

01:52.501 --> 01:54.494
A snake in the cash register!

01:55.921 --> 01:57.961
Yeah, great prank, fellas. Great.

01:58.132 --> 02:02.461
- Oh, I'm gonna be sick tonight.
- Hey, Moe, you wanna smell my flower?

02:02.678 --> 02:04.600
Do I!

02:07.182 --> 02:08.842
I'm burning up here!

02:10.352 --> 02:13.570
Taking advantage
of my alcohol-soaked clothes.

02:14.231 --> 02:15.975
Oh, it's funny and it makes you think.

02:16.191 --> 02:21.670
I need some coffee before I black out.
Homer, pass me the sugar.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.774
This is gonna be great.

02:27.161 --> 02:30.779
- Oh, there's sugar all over the bar now.
- That's not funny, Homer.

02:30.956 --> 02:36.330
Yeah. We were just messing around,
and you had to go too far.

02:36.253 --> 02:39.171
How many people want Homer
banned from this place for life?

02:39.381 --> 02:41.919
- Yeah!
- Come on, everybody.

02:42.920 --> 02:44.100
This bar is like a tavern to me.

02:44.219 --> 02:47.968
Sorry, Homer. You should've thought of
that before giving me the sugar-me-do.

02:48.140 --> 02:51.675
I'm taking your caricature down
from Mount Lushmore...

02:53.312 --> 02:56.640
...and I'm pulling your favorite song
out of the jukebox.

02:56.273 --> 03:00.105
- "It's Raining Men"?
- Yeah, not no more it ain't.

03:08.285 --> 03:10.741
Joke's on them. I'm still alive.

03:13.207 --> 03:14.535
Cheer up, Homer.

03:14.708 --> 03:16.119
- Can't.
- Okay.

03:16.293 --> 03:19.800
What if you pretended
that this couch were a bar?

03:19.296 --> 03:22.167
Then you could spend more nights
at home with us.

03:22.341 --> 03:25.425
I am not going to dignify that
with an answer.

03:25.636 --> 03:27.110
Look on the bright side, Dad.

03:27.179 --> 03:29.468
Did you know the Chinese
use the same word for crisis...

03:29.640 --> 03:33.554
...as they do for opportunity?
- Yes. "Cris-a-tunity."

03:33.727 --> 03:37.642
You're right. I've been wasting
my life away in that dump for years.

03:37.856 --> 03:41.230
That's it. I'm going to find
a new bar to drink in.

03:41.193 --> 03:44.811
And I'm gonna get drunker
than I've ever been in my entire life.

03:44.989 --> 03:47.650
Bart, where's my wallet?

03:47.241 --> 03:49.399
- Right here, Dad.
- Thank you.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.623
- Wow, classy.
- Good evening, sir.

03:58.836 --> 04:01.457
Would you please leave
without a fuss right now?

04:01.630 --> 04:03.955
Okay.

04:09.221 --> 04:12.800
This looks like a nice, friendly place.

04:12.224 --> 04:15.260
Sammy, you're too old
to go on a date with two twins...

04:15.436 --> 04:19.101
...on the same night you're supposed to
marry Diane without Rebecca knowing.

04:19.273 --> 04:23.317
I'll make you a bet. If this affects my
major-league comeback, I'll sell the bar.

04:23.527 --> 04:25.401
Woody, give me a beer.

04:25.612 --> 04:27.854
I think you've had enough,
Mr. Peterson.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.320
My chiropractor says
I can't carry you home anymore.

04:31.201 --> 04:34.535
Just give me another beer,
you brain-dead hick.

04:34.705 --> 04:36.781
I'll kill you. I'll kill all of you!

04:36.957 --> 04:40.291
Settle down, Normie.
Gotta save those pipes for karaoke.

04:43.714 --> 04:46.300
I love you guys.

04:55.684 --> 04:57.226
Wait a minute.

04:57.394 --> 05:00.810
There's something bothering me
about this place.

05:01.230 --> 05:05.981
I know. This lesbian bar
doesn't have a fire exit!

05:06.153 --> 05:10.732
- Enjoy your deathtrap, ladies.
- What was her problem?

05:12.340 --> 05:16.826
Greetings, good man.
Might I trouble you for a drink?

05:17.390 --> 05:20.989
- Oh, get out of here, Homer.
- Homer? Who is Homer?

05:21.168 --> 05:24.390
My name is Guy Incognito.

05:31.470 --> 05:34.839
Oh, my God.
This man is my exact double.

05:35.265 --> 05:38.101
That dog has a puffy tail!

05:40.200 --> 05:43.270
Here, Puff. Here, Puff.

05:46.485 --> 05:48.228
The last bar in Springfield.

05:48.404 --> 05:51.773
If they don't let me in here,
I'm gonna have to quit drinking.

05:52.616 --> 05:54.241
Shut up, liver!

05:55.327 --> 05:56.905
My liver hurts.

06:01.750 --> 06:05.415
- I'd like a beer, please.
- Sorry, you gotta be a pilot to drink here.

06:05.587 --> 06:08.161
- But I am a pilot.
- Where's your uniform?

06:08.966 --> 06:11.801
I stowed it safely
in the overhead compartment.

06:12.110 --> 06:16.423
- Well, you talk the talk. Here's a loaner.
- We need a pilot, pronto.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.800
- Who wants to fly to the Windy City?
- I'll go! Me! I'm your man!

06:21.228 --> 06:22.603
Conditions are a bit windy.

06:22.813 --> 06:24.936
Well, on second thought,
maybe I'll sit down.

06:25.107 --> 06:26.981
- You.
- But I...

06:27.151 --> 06:30.733
You're not just impersonating
a pilot so you can drink here, are you?

06:30.904 --> 06:34.523
Yeah. That's exactly why I'm here.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.989
You flyboys. You crack me up.

06:37.202 --> 06:39.658
But I keep telling you, I'm not a pilot.

06:39.830 --> 06:42.403
And I keep telling you
you flyboys crack me up!

06:42.624 --> 06:46.207
- Hi, I'm Alan. I'm your copilot.
- Yeah...

06:47.400 --> 06:48.581
As a change of pace...

06:48.756 --> 06:52.588
...I'm gonna let you do most of the
work. I think you're ready for it, Alan.

06:54.136 --> 06:57.470
And I'll just get us started.

07:00.517 --> 07:02.806
We'll need that to live.

07:09.818 --> 07:15.239
If word gets out about this, Crazy Clown
Airlines will be a laughingstock.

07:15.449 --> 07:17.270
In exchange for your silence...

07:17.201 --> 07:21.198
...I'm prepared to offer your family free
tickets to anywhere in the United States.

07:21.372 --> 07:23.530
Excluding Alaska and Hawaii,
the freak states.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.705
Good news, everybody.
Because I endangered lives...

07:27.878 --> 07:29.420
...we can fly anywhere we want.

07:29.630 --> 07:30.910
- Alaska!
- Hawaii!

07:32.299 --> 07:33.877
I don't know, Homer.

07:34.510 --> 07:36.803
We're right in the middle
of the busy housekeeping season.

07:37.120 --> 07:40.132
But, Marge, you deserve a vacation.

07:40.307 --> 07:43.890
It's a chance for you to clean up
after us in a whole other state.

07:44.103 --> 07:48.646
But getting on a plane like that seems
like a hassle coupled with a burden.

07:48.857 --> 07:52.108
Come on, Marge. I wanna shake off
the dust of this one-horse town.

07:52.277 --> 07:55.729
I wanna explore the world. I wanna
watch TV in a different time zone.

07:55.906 --> 07:59.655
I wanna visit strange, exotic malls.
I'm sick of eating hoagies.

07:59.827 --> 08:04.323
I want a grinder, a sub, a footlong hero.
I wanna live, Marge!

08:04.498 --> 08:08.662
Won't you let me live?
Won't you, please?

08:14.466 --> 08:17.716
So, Marge, pretty sweet, eh?

08:17.886 --> 08:20.294
Oh, I forgot to clean
the lint basket in the dryer.

08:20.472 --> 08:23.841
If someone broke into the house
and did laundry, it could start a fire.

08:25.436 --> 08:31.308
Oh, great. I specifically asked
not to be seated next to a baby.

08:33.610 --> 08:36.361
We must be really flying high.

08:36.530 --> 08:40.289
Those people down there
look all tiny and blurry.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.407
Just like the inside of a cataract.

08:42.620 --> 08:43.948
Attention, passengers.

08:44.121 --> 08:49.790
Due to our policy of overselling flights,
this flight has been oversold.

08:49.293 --> 08:51.416
In accordance with FAA rules...

08:51.587 --> 08:56.249
...the first two people to the front
will be upgraded to first class.

08:59.511 --> 09:01.540
Okay, you two.

09:01.263 --> 09:03.422
Come on, Bart,
they're gonna pamper us.

09:04.224 --> 09:06.466
Not literally, of course.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.230
I come for the service...

09:14.401 --> 09:18.351
...but I stay for the legroom.

09:21.575 --> 09:24.362
Flight crew, prepare for takeoff.

09:26.580 --> 09:30.115
I think I'll go get a picture
of the plane taking off.

09:30.292 --> 09:33.744
Marge, what's wrong?
Are you hungry? Sleepy? Gassy?

09:33.921 --> 09:39.128
- Gassy? Is it gas? It's gas, isn't it?
- Homer, I never told you this before...

09:39.301 --> 09:41.757
...but I'm not a good flier.

09:45.557 --> 09:48.594
I have to get off the plane.
Let me off the plane.

09:48.811 --> 09:51.847
I'm asking you nicely
to open the doors.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.899
Take it easy, Marge.
How about if we dope you up real good?

09:55.670 --> 09:57.605
Let me off! Let me off! Let me off!

10:04.660 --> 10:08.111
It's okay, Marge,
we don't need to go on a trip.

10:08.330 --> 10:12.198
We'll just wait for the killer bees
to come to us.

10:18.215 --> 10:21.133
You know, I have this feeling
that we forgot something.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.933
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Mom, are you feeling any better?

10:30.102 --> 10:34.811
- Yes, but I'd rather not talk about it.
- Permit me to solve the mystery.

10:35.240 --> 10:36.933
Your mother has a fear of flying.

10:37.151 --> 10:40.484
So much for the days when I could say,
"At least my mother's normal."

10:40.654 --> 10:43.904
- Everybody's got a fear of something.
- Not everybody.

10:44.116 --> 10:46.987
- Sock puppets.
- Where?! Where?!

10:47.161 --> 10:49.402
Mom, are you sure
you don't want to discuss it?

10:49.621 --> 10:52.112
Sure as sugar.

10:55.850 --> 11:00.424
Lisa, the important thing is for your
mother to repress what happened...

11:00.591 --> 11:05.169
...push it deep down inside her
so she'll never annoy us again.

11:05.346 --> 11:07.718
If we don't encourage her
to vent her feelings...

11:07.890 --> 11:09.598
...they can come out in other ways.

11:09.767 --> 11:12.851
I just realized we never had
a wedding for the cat and the dog.

11:13.620 --> 11:15.350
They've been living in sin.

11:25.199 --> 11:27.275
Mom, you've been cooking all night?

11:27.493 --> 11:31.193
Judge, jury and executioner
all rolled into one, you are.

11:31.830 --> 11:33.953
See, Dad?
I told you Mom would have problems.

11:34.124 --> 11:38.585
No, no, honey, it's all right.
Really, I'm fine. I'm all right.

11:38.754 --> 11:42.880
Mother always said don't complain.
Be good. Behave. Behave.

11:42.257 --> 11:45.128
Be nice. Smile. Be polite.
Don't make waves.

11:45.302 --> 11:49.596
You heard your mother's ramblings.
She's fine, so behave.

11:54.478 --> 11:57.396
Marge, it's 3 a.m.

11:57.564 --> 12:01.183
- Shouldn't you be baking?
- In a little while.

12:03.195 --> 12:04.523
Mom, can we talk to you?

12:04.697 --> 12:08.112
Can't talk. Keeping myself
in a state of catlike readiness.

12:09.410 --> 12:11.340
Neat.

12:11.245 --> 12:13.534
Anyway, Mom,
maybe you should go into therapy.

12:13.747 --> 12:16.951
No, I don't need therapy.
I'm fine. And it's too expensive.

12:17.167 --> 12:19.741
And I don't believe in it.
It breaks up families.

12:19.920 --> 12:23.289
It turns wives against husbands,
children against fathers...

12:23.465 --> 12:24.794
...neighbors against me.

12:24.967 --> 12:28.550
You don't have to pay some
fancy psychiatrist 10 bucks an hour...

12:28.721 --> 12:30.594
...to get top-notch therapy.

12:30.806 --> 12:32.680
Hello. Radio Psychic.

12:32.850 --> 12:35.767
You will die a terrible, terrible death.

12:35.936 --> 12:38.557
I'm sorry. That was our last caller.

12:38.731 --> 12:40.854
Okay, I'm getting something now.

12:41.775 --> 12:44.776
Okay. You will die
a terrible, terrible death.

12:44.945 --> 12:47.210
- But...
- Thank you for calling Radio Psychic.

12:47.197 --> 12:49.523
- Do you have a song request?
- "It's Raining Men."

12:51.744 --> 12:53.452
Now, Marge, "Dear Abby" says...

12:53.620 --> 12:56.705
...seeing films about air travel
can calm your fears.

12:56.874 --> 12:58.701
Here are some upbeat titles.

12:58.917 --> 13:01.373
Hero. Fearless.

13:01.545 --> 13:03.205
Alive!

13:03.422 --> 13:06.957
No thanks to the plane,
many of us are still...

13:07.134 --> 13:09.423
...alive!
- Alive!

13:09.595 --> 13:11.671
We certainly are.

13:12.681 --> 13:14.804
Pass me another hunk of copilot.

13:14.975 --> 13:16.600
Dad, Mom's getting worse.

13:16.810 --> 13:20.179
You have to take her to see a real
psychiatrist. Look how tense she is.

13:20.397 --> 13:21.939
She's fine.

13:28.280 --> 13:32.741
All right, Lisa, you got your way.
Your mom's going to a psychiatrist.

13:32.910 --> 13:35.864
She's gonna tell Marge to leave me.
It'll break up the family.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.743
You'll have to live with
your grandmother and pick beans.

13:38.916 --> 13:40.825
Dad, I like picking beans
with Grandma.

13:41.100 --> 13:43.671
- Well, keep it up, then.
- Okay, I will.

13:43.837 --> 13:46.209
- Good. You do that.
- Fine.

13:46.382 --> 13:50.545
- You'll be picking many a bean.
- Hope I do.

13:51.595 --> 13:54.300
I don't believe it! Principal Skinner.

13:54.515 --> 13:55.843
Well, well, well.

13:57.726 --> 14:01.344
- I never thought I'd win this easy.
- This has nothing to do with you.

14:01.563 --> 14:05.561
I have many, many issues
with my beloved smother... Mother.

14:05.776 --> 14:08.650
Leave that man alone
with his pain and sit down.

14:08.237 --> 14:09.731
Okay.

14:13.492 --> 14:15.319
All right, how much do you charge?

14:15.536 --> 14:18.157
If money is a problem,
I charge on a sliding scale.

14:18.330 --> 14:20.287
I can go as low as $30 an hour.

14:20.499 --> 14:23.251
- Keep sliding.
- Thirty dollars will be fine.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.162
First, what are your qualifications?

14:27.381 --> 14:29.410
Well...

14:29.675 --> 14:32.842
Oh, no.
I'm not here to take a reading test.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.218
I wanna see some credentials.

14:35.431 --> 14:38.882
I'm sorry, doctor. He's just afraid
you'll blame all my problems on him.

14:39.590 --> 14:40.886
I'm not here to blame anyone.

14:43.147 --> 14:46.101
Marge, therapy can be
an intense process.

14:46.317 --> 14:48.190
We'll go deep into your subconscious...

14:48.402 --> 14:54.606
...and we're not going to stop until we've
exposed the root of your fear of flying.

14:55.868 --> 14:58.573
Don't worry.
This is a private sanctuary...

14:58.787 --> 15:02.951
...where whatever transpires
will be just between us.

15:03.709 --> 15:07.420
Oh, that's just Murray the window
washer. He comes every day at 12:00.

15:07.212 --> 15:10.379
But it's a few seconds before 12:00.

15:18.724 --> 15:21.559
Ever since you started therapy,
all you can do is talk about yourself.

15:21.727 --> 15:23.554
Well, what about me, Marge?

15:23.771 --> 15:26.937
I just left my first session.
I haven't even opened my mouth yet.

15:27.149 --> 15:30.814
You see? You see?
"I just left my first session...

15:30.986 --> 15:34.355
...and I haven't opened
my mouth yet."

15:34.573 --> 15:37.907
Marge, there's no simple explanation
for your fear of flying...

15:38.118 --> 15:41.119
...but it can probably be traced
to some childhood trauma.

15:41.288 --> 15:42.617
Think back.

15:42.790 --> 15:46.704
What's the earliest memory you have
of something bad happening?

15:48.870 --> 15:51.337
That would have to be
my first day of school.

15:52.508 --> 15:55.924
They got this thing called a fire drill.

15:56.950 --> 15:59.677
They use it to drill a flaming hole
in your head.

16:01.642 --> 16:07.929
And there's only one big toilet, and they
make you all go at the same time.

16:09.233 --> 16:12.684
The kids at school were even worse.

16:18.492 --> 16:20.366
You like the Monkees?

16:20.536 --> 16:22.575
You know they don't write
their own songs.

16:22.746 --> 16:25.498
- They do so.
- They don't play their own instruments.

16:25.708 --> 16:27.581
No! No!

16:27.793 --> 16:30.350
That's not even
Michael Nesmith's real hat.

16:32.890 --> 16:34.662
- Kids can be so cruel.
- But it's true.

16:34.842 --> 16:37.878
They didn't write their own songs
or play their own instruments.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.129
The Monkees
weren't about music, Marge.

16:40.347 --> 16:43.597
They were about rebellion,
about political and social upheaval.

16:46.478 --> 16:49.812
- Did you talk about me in therapy today?
- I don't think so.

16:49.982 --> 16:51.476
Tell me the truth!

16:51.650 --> 16:54.568
Don't tell her I raised my voice. Don't.

16:54.903 --> 16:56.777
Happy family. Happy family.

16:56.989 --> 17:00.109
I keep having the same dream.

17:00.284 --> 17:04.328
I'm the mother from Lost in Space.

17:04.538 --> 17:06.246
Ready for breakfast, Dr. Smith?

17:06.415 --> 17:08.573
Oh, being stuck
on this godforsaken planet...

17:08.751 --> 17:11.916
...has vanquished
what little appetite I had.

17:14.631 --> 17:20.550
Warning! Warning!
Dr. Smith refuses to do his astro-chores.

17:20.721 --> 17:23.176
Why, you clattering clank of cogs and...

17:23.348 --> 17:26.184
My dear lady, as you well know,
my back is a disaster area.

17:26.352 --> 17:28.391
D'oh, the pain! D'oh, the pain of it all!

17:28.604 --> 17:33.147
Danger! Danger!
My hooks are flailing wildly.

17:36.278 --> 17:40.525
Wait! Daddy, wait! Please don't leave!

17:40.699 --> 17:42.692
Take me with you!

17:43.118 --> 17:47.864
Marge, are you aware you just said
"Please don't leave" to your daddy?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.664
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

17:49.833 --> 17:52.241
And you also infringed
on any number of copyrights.

17:53.379 --> 17:56.830
Now, let's talk about your father.

17:56.298 --> 17:58.172
Sure, okay. I'll talk about Father.

17:58.342 --> 18:01.343
Father Christmas. That's what
they call Santa Claus in England.

18:01.512 --> 18:05.940
They drive on the wrong side
of the road there. Now, that's crazy.

18:05.265 --> 18:08.966
People always say how small England is,
but you couldn't fit it all in here.

18:09.144 --> 18:12.513
Not by a long shot.
You know what, I'm cured.

18:13.232 --> 18:15.687
Marge, get back here
and tell me about your father.

18:16.151 --> 18:19.686
- What did he do for a living?
- Okay.

18:19.863 --> 18:22.437
Okay, but you're gonna make
a big deal out of this.

18:23.750 --> 18:27.286
- He was a pilot.
- A pilot? This is a big deal.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.328
You see?

18:29.498 --> 18:33.330
Marge, this may not be
the best time to bring this up...

18:33.210 --> 18:36.377
...but your last check bounced.
- Wait, I'm remembering something.

18:36.589 --> 18:39.922
- Yes, Marge, there's still the matter of...
- I was a little girl...

18:43.637 --> 18:47.717
Goodbye, Margie. Be a good girl, now.

18:47.933 --> 18:51.384
- Why does Daddy have to leave?
- Because he's a pilot.

18:51.604 --> 18:56.396
- He flies all over the world.
- I wanna see Daddy fly.

18:56.608 --> 18:59.645
Margie! No, come back!

19:01.363 --> 19:03.735
Daddy? Daddy, where are you? Dad...?

19:03.907 --> 19:06.149
So who wants preflight cookie?

19:06.327 --> 19:09.162
- Fig Newtons? Hydrox?
- Daddy?

19:11.582 --> 19:15.959
Don't look at me! Don't look at me!

19:20.883 --> 19:23.670
My father was a stewardess.

19:23.844 --> 19:27.940
Marge, there's nothing
to be ashamed of here.

19:27.306 --> 19:32.510
Today male flight attendants,
or stewards, are common.

19:32.227 --> 19:34.540
- They are?
- Yes.

19:34.271 --> 19:38.518
Thanks to trailblazers like your father.
You might say he was a pioneer.

19:38.734 --> 19:40.620
Yeah.

19:40.235 --> 19:42.691
You might even say
he was an American hero.

19:42.905 --> 19:44.364
Let's not go nuts.

19:44.531 --> 19:47.568
The important thing
is that we've pinpointed...

19:47.743 --> 19:52.370
...the precise moment when
you developed your fear of flying.

19:52.247 --> 19:54.821
Wait, some other stuff
is coming back to me.

19:56.251 --> 19:58.125
Open wide.

19:58.295 --> 20:02.440
Here comes the airplane.

20:11.850 --> 20:16.140
This is what a corn field
looks like, honey.

20:20.651 --> 20:24.351
You think those things could also
have contributed to my fear of flying?

20:24.571 --> 20:29.150
- Yes, yes. It's all a rich tapestry.
- Oh, thank you. You've changed my life.

20:29.326 --> 20:31.698
We've really just begun
to scratch the surface.

20:31.870 --> 20:34.408
There's still the serious problem
of your husband.

20:34.581 --> 20:37.369
That's okay. You don't have
to make her into a superwoman.

20:37.584 --> 20:40.870
- She can get on the plane, that's plenty.
- Thank you, doctor.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.377
Whenever the wind whistles
through the leaves...

20:43.549 --> 20:47.499
...I'll think, "Lowenstein. Lowenstein."

20:47.720 --> 20:50.674
- My name is Zweig.
- Lowenstein...

20:58.689 --> 21:03.896
Don't worry about a thing, honey.
I'm gonna help you through this.

21:05.904 --> 21:08.442
Those are all normal noises.

21:08.615 --> 21:12.399
Luggage compartment closing.
Cross-checking.

21:12.578 --> 21:15.911
Just sit back and relax.

21:17.958 --> 21:21.908
That's just the engine powering up.

21:22.870 --> 21:26.370
That's just the engine struggling.

21:28.520 --> 21:32.100
That's just the carp
swimming around your ankles.
