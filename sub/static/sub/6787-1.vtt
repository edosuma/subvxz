00:36.529 --> 00:41.284
There on a windswept bluff, he stands
waiting. The man of your dreams.

00:42.169 --> 00:46.242
The man who"II love you more
than anything the rest of your life.

00:47.089 --> 00:50.718
You run to each other.
Your bodies, your lips...

00:50.929 --> 00:56.003
...they"re coming closer and closer
together. Until, finally...

00:56.209 --> 00:58.564
...you kiss.

01:01.089 --> 01:02.920
Okay, go.

01:03.129 --> 01:05.324
Janet, like this.

01:09.169 --> 01:10.807
I feel weird, Bev.

01:11.209 --> 01:14.884
Weird? Wait till he shoves
his tongue in your mouth.

01:23.449 --> 01:26.680
Ann, did you get the lights
for the dining room?

01:26.889 --> 01:29.084
l"m looking for them, Teresa.

01:29.289 --> 01:31.439
Now this is Christmas, huh?

01:31.809 --> 01:33.208
Yes, it"s beautif ul.

01:33.569 --> 01:35.400
Have Lou look for them.

01:35.609 --> 01:38.442
She wants it up
before Leo and Bev get back.

01:39.809 --> 01:41.401
I gotta go.

01:44.649 --> 01:46.560
Okay, Leo.

01:47.289 --> 01:52.124
Beverly Ann Donof rio, your father"s
waiting to go buy the tree!

01:52.409 --> 01:54.001
l"m coming, Mom!

01:54.369 --> 01:57.008
Okay, so is Christmas.

01:58.889 --> 02:03.440
-This song"s giving me a headache.
-Wait. Before you go with Pop.

02:03.729 --> 02:06.766
Why would a guy
put his tongue in my mouth?

02:06.969 --> 02:08.482
What?!

02:09.089 --> 02:13.162
A boy does that because
he wants you to bite it off.

02:16.129 --> 02:17.721
Go.

02:19.569 --> 02:21.048
Bye, Mom.

02:29.849 --> 02:31.168
Hi.

02:32.209 --> 02:33.688
-You ready?
-Yeah.

02:33.889 --> 02:35.607
Let"s go.

02:37.689 --> 02:40.920
-Pop, everyone"s decorating the house.
-Good.

02:41.129 --> 02:42.562
Janet wanted to come.

02:42.769 --> 02:45.681
When you"re in college,
it"II be her turn.

02:46.449 --> 02:49.361
Dreaming of <i>w</i> armth?
Dream <i>w</i> ith the Everly Brothers.

02:49.649 --> 02:53.119
-Good, that"s our song!
-Great! Ready? One, two:

03:17.569 --> 03:20.367
Pop, this is it! Pull over.

03:20.569 --> 03:22.639
The big one, there. See?

03:27.769 --> 03:30.647
l"II buy that for you when l"m rich.

03:30.849 --> 03:34.046
-I bet you will.
-Mom and sis would like it.

03:36.209 --> 03:39.121
You know what you want for Christmas?

03:40.929 --> 03:42.726
You want the bike, right?

03:42.929 --> 03:46.080
It"s the bike. But you think
it"s too expensive.

03:46.289 --> 03:48.484
See, I know how you think.

03:48.689 --> 03:53.683
Speak up. If you don"t ask for
anything, it"s what you get, nothing.

03:56.849 --> 03:58.248
Okay.

04:01.169 --> 04:04.320
There"s this guy, Billy Schnar,
he"s really cute.

04:04.569 --> 04:05.479
Billy Schnar?

04:05.849 --> 04:09.762
We"re the smartest in class.
You know who he likes? Guess!

04:09.969 --> 04:13.439
-Who?
-Melissa Thomas, you know her?

04:13.649 --> 04:16.447
The one with braces and ugly red hair.

04:16.689 --> 04:21.558
She thought Israel was in Europe.
You know why he likes her? Guess!

04:21.769 --> 04:25.444
-Because she"s stupid.
-No, because she"s got boobs!

04:25.689 --> 04:29.568
Or it looks like she does,
but she doesn"t. She wears a bra...

04:29.769 --> 04:32.408
...which s <i>q</i> uishes her fat together...

04:32.649 --> 04:35.243
...and makes her look like
she has big boobs.

04:35.569 --> 04:38.925
Pop, l"m gonna die
if I don"t marry Billy Schnar.

04:39.409 --> 04:42.845
l"m gonna die all because
Melissa has boobs?

04:43.049 --> 04:46.246
That"s just way too tragic,
even for Shakespeare.

04:46.689 --> 04:51.240
Okay, Pop, so that"s why for
Christmas, l"d like a bra.

04:52.369 --> 04:55.884
To enhance what I got,
which is more than Melissa.

04:56.129 --> 05:00.042
-You"re too young.
-Pop, you can"t negotiate my boobs.

05:00.329 --> 05:03.799
Too young or not, l"ve got them.
l"m a woman.

05:04.009 --> 05:07.479
-It"s hard to see through my clothes.
-<i>Q</i> uiet!

05:07.729 --> 05:09.845
The answer is no.

05:17.009 --> 05:19.728
Keep your mind on books, not boys.

05:20.169 --> 05:24.640
<i>T</i> his is <i>w</i> hy therapists are <i>w</i> ealthy.:
moments like this.

05:24.849 --> 05:29.969
<i>W</i> hy didn <i>'</i> t he just get her the bra?
/t <i>'</i> s certainly cheaper than a bicycle.

05:30.289 --> 05:33.167
<i>P</i> arents and the damage they can do.

05:33.369 --> 05:36.008
Sometimes, it <i>'</i> s endless.

05:36.929 --> 05:39.966
But she survived.
<i>y</i> ou kno <i>w w</i> hat they say.:

05:40.169 --> 05:43.559
<i>"T</i> hat <i>w</i> hich doesn <i>'</i> t kill you,
makes you <i>w</i> ant to die. <i>"</i>

05:44.569 --> 05:48.198
/f she <i>w</i> as Southern,
she <i>'</i> d have turned life into a song.

05:50.489 --> 05:54.243
Since she <i>'</i> s from Connecticut,
she turned it into a memoir.

05:54.489 --> 05:57.640
Someone <i>w</i> ants to publish it,
if she clears one hurdle.

05:57.849 --> 05:59.726
So she called me for help.

06:00.289 --> 06:05.124
<i>T</i> hat <i>'</i> s <i>w</i> hy this is a tough day
to tell her /<i>'</i> m leaving her.

06:07.729 --> 06:12.086
/ can al <i>w</i> ays tell <i>w</i> hen she <i>'</i> s nervous.
She <i>w</i> ears a lot of makeup.

06:12.289 --> 06:16.043
And today, she <i>'</i> s packed on
an e <i>x</i> tra layer of nervous.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.477
Forty minutes late.
l"m not complaining.

06:20.329 --> 06:22.843
-It"s just so unlike you.
-Sorry.

06:23.049 --> 06:27.839
<i>W</i> e <i>w</i> ent off to solve the problem.
Her problem. Mine <i>w</i> ould have to <i>w</i> ait.

06:28.289 --> 06:31.884
-What happened?
-You"re cold, lean into the vent.

06:34.049 --> 06:35.721
Sorry.

06:38.369 --> 06:42.328
-Thanks for driving me to Wallingford.
-Just make it fast.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.402
If Ray doesn"t sign,
they won"t publish it.

06:45.649 --> 06:46.843
He will.

06:47.049 --> 06:51.406
-I know seeing Ray is hard for you.
-Seeing Ray doesn"t bother me.

06:51.689 --> 06:53.805
It should. And I understand.

06:58.569 --> 07:02.767
I won"t make myself nuts.
l"II stay calm and be positive.

07:02.969 --> 07:04.368
Good.

07:05.009 --> 07:07.318
Did I show you the galleys?

07:08.889 --> 07:11.449
It"s starting to look
like a real book.

07:20.329 --> 07:25.005
-Did you just put spit in my hair?
-Yeah, l"m fixing it. Sorry.

07:28.809 --> 07:30.242
Just a little--

07:31.329 --> 07:32.842
Okay.

07:35.089 --> 07:39.799
I have a surprise for you.
I finished the dedication.

07:42.449 --> 07:47.807
"Of the many men who have come into my
life, there is finally one I trust.

07:49.249 --> 07:52.047
Jason, this book is for you."

07:57.409 --> 08:00.242
Don"t take this the wrong way...

08:01.769 --> 08:03.919
...but don"t dedicate the book to me.

08:04.129 --> 08:06.962
Let"s just leave it at that.
Just don"t.

08:07.169 --> 08:09.763
Fine. Fine. Great.

08:10.449 --> 08:14.442
l"m sorry, it is possible I have
my own stuff going on today.

08:16.409 --> 08:18.684
What? What is it?

08:21.049 --> 08:23.847
No. It"s nothing.

08:24.169 --> 08:28.048
l"II get over it. Look, don"t worry.

08:29.849 --> 08:33.727
l"m having a bad day.
What"s one bad day, right?

08:33.929 --> 08:37.604
One day? Are you kidding?
Let me <i>q</i> uote myself.

08:39.369 --> 08:43.044
"One day can make your life.
One day can ruin your life.

08:43.249 --> 08:48.084
All life is, is four or five big days
that change everything."

08:54.609 --> 08:59.046
Sky Barrister is my dreamboat!

08:59.489 --> 09:02.401
Sit down, you"II hurt yourself.
Be caref ul.

09:02.889 --> 09:07.246
-Tina, you need a little more rouge.
-I have some right here.

09:14.609 --> 09:17.362
Hey, Bev! Tina!

09:17.769 --> 09:20.681
-Where you going?
-We"re going to a party!

09:20.889 --> 09:22.607
-Can we come?
-Sorry.

09:22.969 --> 09:25.483
She wouldn"t let us come
to some party.

09:25.689 --> 09:27.566
Are we invited to this party?

09:27.769 --> 09:29.919
-They"re Fay"s f riends.
-They"re not.

09:30.129 --> 09:33.041
My parents are f riends
with their parents.

09:33.249 --> 09:36.559
What"s important is
Sky Barrister will be there.

09:36.769 --> 09:39.602
Sky has had his hands
in everything you got.

09:39.849 --> 09:43.637
And has a ton of your poems.
And does he call you once?

09:43.849 --> 09:46.807
No. Bev, you are truly a great person.

09:47.089 --> 09:50.240
But someone as conceited
as Sky won"t see that.

09:50.449 --> 09:53.247
Because all he can see is himself.

09:54.369 --> 09:57.884
-You know l"m right.
-It"s true, Bev.

09:59.409 --> 10:02.242
-Let me wear that dress.
-What?

10:03.849 --> 10:07.285
If I look half as beautif ul
as you in that dress...

10:07.569 --> 10:09.639
...Sky will have to notice me.

10:09.849 --> 10:12.841
-You can wear my dress.
-No.

10:17.249 --> 10:19.285
No, Bev. It won"t fit.

10:19.489 --> 10:22.208
-You got to let me wear that dress.
-Why?

10:22.449 --> 10:24.246
Because I love you.

10:24.449 --> 10:28.203
-Please, please, please.
-All right.

10:28.409 --> 10:29.808
Put the top up!

10:41.889 --> 10:45.564
Look at all these new cars.
Tina, park in the street.

10:45.769 --> 10:46.758
Come on!

10:46.969 --> 10:51.281
-Did you take my scarf?
-I got it. You"re sitting on my purse.

10:51.489 --> 10:56.040
Bobby will crash with his f riend.
This dress is swimming on me.

10:56.289 --> 10:59.918
And don"t blame me
if this party"s boring and no f un.

11:00.129 --> 11:02.040
Fun? Fun?

11:02.369 --> 11:05.122
Fun is what you bring with you.

11:07.969 --> 11:11.325
-Do I have something in my braces?
-I don"t know.

11:11.569 --> 11:12.843
There.

11:13.049 --> 11:14.880
-It"s out.
-Yeah.

11:16.689 --> 11:20.602
Who invited her to my party?
Who? Did you? Did you?

11:20.809 --> 11:22.401
I invited Fay.

11:22.649 --> 11:26.437
The noseguard points to me,
like he"s gonna hurt me.

11:28.009 --> 11:31.206
-<i>Q</i> uick, give me that!
-They"re stuffing themselves.

11:31.409 --> 11:35.402
-Guess it"s what Bobby likes.
-Wonder what that feels like.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.518
-Are they even?
-I think so.

11:40.449 --> 11:44.601
-You could be with any girl here.
-Of course, I know that.

11:44.809 --> 11:46.765
l"m just a placekicker.

11:47.329 --> 11:49.559
Bobby, wait. Where are we going?

11:49.769 --> 11:52.681
-Come here.
-What?

12:00.049 --> 12:01.880
Mind if I sit?

12:03.329 --> 12:04.842
Great.

12:09.609 --> 12:12.282
-Who"s that sitting on Kevin?
-Some townie.

12:15.929 --> 12:17.885
-Who"d you come with?
-Ray Hasek.

12:18.089 --> 12:21.047
-Him? Where is he?
-In the bathroom.

12:21.249 --> 12:23.080
Stay here.

13:02.969 --> 13:05.119
Hello, Sky.

13:10.609 --> 13:13.885
Tommy, why do you gotta
sneak up on people?

13:14.089 --> 13:15.966
You idiot. Shoot!

13:16.169 --> 13:18.808
Sorry, Bev. I didn"t mean
to scare you.

13:19.009 --> 13:22.968
l"m sorry. l"m just completely
distracted at the moment.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.842
Don"t talk right now.

13:33.569 --> 13:36.686
-Hungry?
-Oh, sure.

13:37.089 --> 13:40.399
-You want some salt?
-Sure.

13:57.969 --> 14:00.688
I checked out F. Scott
Fitzgerald"s stories--

14:00.889 --> 14:06.646
l"m doing something daring right now,
and l"m working up some optimism.

14:06.849 --> 14:09.921
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

14:11.809 --> 14:15.643
-l"m just a big chicken.
-No, Bev.

14:16.289 --> 14:21.363
Someone once said a coward and a hero
have one thing in common: fear.

14:21.569 --> 14:25.562
You may be scared,
but you"re no coward.

14:25.769 --> 14:28.647
I come off the field,
following me are scouts...

14:28.849 --> 14:32.922
...f rom Notre Dame, Penn State,
Ohio State, all talking to me.

14:33.129 --> 14:37.964
So l"m like, "Alphabetical order."
So the guy f rom Penn State is first--

14:38.169 --> 14:42.640
Sky, wouldn"t Notre Dame be first
if it"s alphabetical order?

14:43.209 --> 14:45.643
-Hi, Sky.
-Hi!

14:48.289 --> 14:50.007
Here.

14:51.609 --> 14:53.008
Don"t open it now.

14:54.169 --> 14:57.844
-Read it later when you can.
-Later when I can.

14:58.049 --> 14:59.402
Read it.

14:59.609 --> 15:02.885
"Silver buttons of night"s
velvet dress unbuttoned...

15:03.089 --> 15:06.559
...to reveal my simple universe
and our heavenly touch."

15:06.769 --> 15:10.648
The last one was about her legs
trembling and heaving bosom.

15:10.849 --> 15:13.158
-She loves you.
-Bev!

15:13.689 --> 15:16.920
I like the poem, Bev! Bev!

15:38.649 --> 15:41.083
-Don"t open that door!
-Okay.

15:52.049 --> 15:54.358
Is everything all right?

16:01.849 --> 16:04.761
Can I have a cigarette?

16:14.089 --> 16:16.284
You"re blowing it out.

16:16.729 --> 16:21.962
You"re blowing it out.
Don"t breathe out. You do it.

16:26.209 --> 16:29.963
I know you. You were in the play
at the high school.

16:30.249 --> 16:33.639
You"re Fay"s f riend.
You"re the smart one.

16:34.449 --> 16:36.644
l"m Ray Hasek.

16:36.849 --> 16:38.282
Bobby"s f riend.

16:38.609 --> 16:43.080
Fay made us go because she painted
all the background stuff. Remember?

16:43.329 --> 16:46.048
-You were the girl.
-Juliet.

16:46.249 --> 16:47.477
Yeah!

16:49.649 --> 16:51.082
You were beautif ul.

16:51.889 --> 16:55.962
I told Bobby, "You watch,
that girl"s gonna be something."

16:57.129 --> 17:00.883
-That"s what I said.
-I write my own stuff too.

17:03.009 --> 17:06.887
-And l"m probably gonna go to NYU.
-l"m sorry.

17:08.249 --> 17:11.924
But no, that"s good. Wow.

17:15.608 --> 17:21.286
Look, I know it"s none of my business,
but why are you crying?

17:22.289 --> 17:24.165
Because of this guy.

17:24.368 --> 17:28.442
He said very personal stuff about me
in f ront of everyone.

17:28.969 --> 17:33.485
But the poem was good.
I think it"II hit him on the way home.

17:33.689 --> 17:36.328
Wait. Who is this guy?

17:40.449 --> 17:41.768
Sky Barrister.

17:42.929 --> 17:46.638
Oh, yeah. I know that asshole.

17:47.129 --> 17:50.280
l"II go tell him not
to say stuff about you.

17:50.729 --> 17:54.278
He"s very handsome,
so don"t hit him in the face.

17:59.689 --> 18:01.725
What is she still doing here?

18:02.089 --> 18:04.364
She"s blond, 26.

18:04.649 --> 18:07.925
And who"s that? I didn"t invite him.

18:13.289 --> 18:15.757
-Hey, Sky.
-What"s going on?

18:16.089 --> 18:17.886
Hit me. Right here.

18:19.809 --> 18:22.607
No, man! Hit me right here!

18:24.449 --> 18:26.758
No! Come on, hit me!

18:28.769 --> 18:31.408
-My hand!
-Sky!

18:34.729 --> 18:37.926
-See? He came in, I went down.
-It"s broken!

18:38.129 --> 18:41.838
-There goes the season!
-Come on. Come on!

18:42.049 --> 18:43.721
Let"s get him!

18:43.929 --> 18:46.238
-Thanks, Tommy.
-See you Monday, Bev.

18:46.449 --> 18:49.282
-Out of the way, Tommy!
-Go, go, go!

18:50.969 --> 18:52.163
Get in the car!

18:52.369 --> 18:55.679
-Let"s go!
-Get in the car!

18:55.889 --> 18:58.278
-I go down and--
-Get in the car!

18:58.649 --> 19:01.880
-We forgot Tina!
-She"s got her own car.

19:02.089 --> 19:05.047
Tommy"s car"s blocking the way.
Go, Bobby!

19:07.649 --> 19:10.880
-Bev, can you hop in f ront, please?
-All right.

19:11.089 --> 19:13.922
This is Bobby"s and my favorite spot.

19:14.129 --> 19:17.758
Ray, take her. Come here, you.

19:17.969 --> 19:20.927
-Bev, get in f ront with Ray.
-l"m going.

19:21.129 --> 19:23.085
Come here, sweetie.

19:24.209 --> 19:28.646
Come on, babe. You know
l"m heading out to basic. Please!

19:29.449 --> 19:32.202
God, l"m gonna miss you so much.

19:33.289 --> 19:34.881
Thanks.

19:45.289 --> 19:48.201
Thanks for doing that
for me back there.

19:49.569 --> 19:51.560
-Does your head hurt?
-No.

19:51.769 --> 19:56.797
My father always said
that my head was like a rock.

19:57.009 --> 19:59.569
He broke his hand twice on it.

19:59.769 --> 20:03.603
What"s in your chest?
What is this?

20:05.249 --> 20:08.844
-It"s Bev"s dress. It"s too big.
-Oh, sweetie.

20:09.049 --> 20:11.199
It didn"t look right on me.

20:11.409 --> 20:15.243
-How come I never see you in school?
-I don"t go.

20:17.649 --> 20:20.641
-Don"t your parents care?
-There"s a lot of it!

20:20.849 --> 20:22.567
My...

20:23.009 --> 20:26.922
...pop, he got drunk and died fishing.

20:27.129 --> 20:31.168
And Ma, she doesn"t want me
hanging around my sister.

20:31.369 --> 20:34.008
She thinks l"m bad like my brother.

20:35.209 --> 20:38.121
So you"re all alone.
You don"t have anybody.

20:41.209 --> 20:44.326
Well, there"s Lizzard, he"s a f riend.

20:44.569 --> 20:47.242
And I got Bobby. He"s like family.

20:47.609 --> 20:50.521
-What you doing?
-Spelling my name in hickies.

20:50.729 --> 20:52.162
Just your first name.

20:52.369 --> 20:54.963
-Let"s get you home.
-Stop!

20:55.209 --> 20:57.803
-Oh, my knee!
-Are you okay?

20:58.009 --> 21:00.045
I don"t wanna go home yet.

21:00.729 --> 21:02.287
But, I....

21:07.209 --> 21:09.769
Listen. Don"t.

21:09.969 --> 21:14.804
Beverly, listen. You shouldn"t get
mix ed up with me. l"m no good.

21:16.129 --> 21:18.484
You were good to me.

21:22.849 --> 21:27.798
Open your eyes.
Don"t take them off of me.

21:32.049 --> 21:33.607
Cool.

21:37.409 --> 21:41.368
Don"t. What are you doing?

21:42.409 --> 21:46.288
-You better stop laughing.
-Leave me alone, Fay.

21:49.489 --> 21:51.320
God bless you.

21:51.569 --> 21:54.003
What is that?

21:55.089 --> 21:57.159
What the heck is this?

21:58.969 --> 22:02.882
-Bev, stop laughing. Give me my shoes.
-Ray. Ray!

22:03.089 --> 22:06.206
-It"s her father.
-l"m looking. I found one.

22:06.409 --> 22:07.683
It"s your father!

22:07.889 --> 22:12.007
-Pete, we"re taking them in.
-What?!

22:12.289 --> 22:13.404
Sorry, Daddy.

22:13.649 --> 22:15.605
What happened to your dress?

22:15.809 --> 22:19.119
-You won"t see that girl again.
-You can"t be trusted.

22:19.329 --> 22:22.048
What? Are you chewing?
Say it again.

22:22.249 --> 22:24.126
l"II call you back.

22:24.329 --> 22:27.765
Look at you. For God"s sake,
button your blouse.

22:31.889 --> 22:35.928
-What happened to you?
-Nothing. l"m still the same.

22:36.129 --> 22:39.439
You know that guy"s brother got
sent up for robbery?

22:39.689 --> 22:43.602
Yes, but he"s doing well in prison.
He"s learning a trade.

22:45.129 --> 22:47.689
All we were doing was making out.

22:48.689 --> 22:51.601
I just met him.
l"d never go past second base.

22:51.809 --> 22:55.802
Which means nothing below the waist.
My waist, not his.

23:01.849 --> 23:04.886
You"re home. Get out.

23:08.329 --> 23:11.480
Pop, I swear, nothing happened.

23:30.449 --> 23:33.919
Look at that guy. He"s so hot!

23:39.409 --> 23:41.798
-Wait.
-No.

23:44.009 --> 23:47.888
/ had to run out. Jason, if it <i>'</i> s you,
say something great.

23:48.369 --> 23:49.438
It"s me.

23:52.209 --> 23:55.007
The last two weeks
have changed my life.

23:55.209 --> 23:58.963
l"m not involved with her.
I had to do this just one day.

23:59.169 --> 24:02.081
l"m gonna tell her
about us this morning.

24:02.289 --> 24:06.567
This afternoon, tops. I swear l"II
be back by 6:00 tonight...

24:06.769 --> 24:09.078
...and you and I are on that plane.

24:09.289 --> 24:13.487
And, okay, here goes. Amelia...

24:18.009 --> 24:20.045
...I love you.

24:23.889 --> 24:27.404
That girlf riend of yours
sure likes that horn.

24:27.649 --> 24:29.799
She"s not my girlf riend.

24:32.489 --> 24:36.038
-She"s my mother.
-Your mother?

24:37.969 --> 24:40.642
Kill me, Fay,
because I want to die!

24:40.849 --> 24:44.808
I want to be dead!
That"s not too much to ask for.

24:45.009 --> 24:48.638
How will I tell my parents?
We can"t talk about anything.

24:48.849 --> 24:52.637
How am I supposed to tell them
I committed a mortal sin?!

24:52.849 --> 24:55.727
Okay! I know, I understand.

24:55.929 --> 24:58.363
Calm down. We"II practice.

24:58.609 --> 25:03.967
Pretend l"m your parents. Say what
you"II say. You"II get through it.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.763
Tell me like you would tell them.

25:10.289 --> 25:13.645
-Mom. Pop.
-Yeah?

25:16.689 --> 25:20.568
-I don"t know how to tell you this.
-But...?

25:21.809 --> 25:25.324
-l"m pregnant.
-My daughter"s a tramp.

25:26.209 --> 25:29.884
My daughter is a tramp!
My daughter"s a tramp!

25:30.089 --> 25:33.126
You"re 15 years old!
How could you do this?

25:33.329 --> 25:36.765
You make me sick to my stomach!
Just take my gun!

25:36.969 --> 25:42.601
Take my gun and shoot me in the head,
tramp! I wish you were never born!

25:43.489 --> 25:45.366
Okay, go.

25:49.489 --> 25:51.559
You can do it.

25:54.449 --> 25:58.522
-Maybe you should tell Ray first.
-Okay.

26:00.849 --> 26:04.967
In Puerto Rico you can get rid of it,
but I don"t have any money.

26:05.169 --> 26:08.206
-Do you have any money?
-No.

26:11.569 --> 26:12.922
That"s it, then.

26:13.129 --> 26:15.962
I have to throw myself
at my parents" mercy.

26:16.969 --> 26:21.440
If they help me take care of the baby,
I can get a job and save money.

26:21.649 --> 26:23.207
That"d be good.

26:23.409 --> 26:27.004
Then I could move to New York,
get a job at a newspaper.

26:27.209 --> 26:31.361
-Nothing big, something small.
-I can"t. Wait! New York?

26:31.889 --> 26:33.242
Bev...

26:33.969 --> 26:36.437
-...what about me?
-What about you?

26:37.329 --> 26:39.047
Well...

26:40.849 --> 26:43.317
...I love you. A lot.

26:43.969 --> 26:45.641
What, Bev?

26:45.849 --> 26:47.965
What are you talking about?!

26:48.849 --> 26:51.044
What?

26:51.729 --> 26:55.802
-Why is this happening to me?
-Bev, l"m sorry. Come on.

26:56.009 --> 26:59.001
My life is over! I might as well jump!

26:59.209 --> 27:01.404
What are you doing? Come on.

27:01.649 --> 27:04.368
We"ve been going out. I mean...

27:04.729 --> 27:06.640
...do you love me?

27:09.729 --> 27:13.688
-It was summer.
-Yeah, but do--?

27:14.009 --> 27:17.240
You"re not the guy
l"m supposed to end up with.

27:19.249 --> 27:21.285
It would derail my life.

27:21.809 --> 27:24.528
Bev, look at me. Bev!

27:24.729 --> 27:27.004
Okay, look. Maybe...

27:27.889 --> 27:32.724
...you"re not supposed to end up with
me. But l"II make you happy. I swear.

27:33.449 --> 27:37.920
If you married me,
I would cherish you...

27:38.129 --> 27:41.439
...for all the time, till death.
Till I die.

27:41.649 --> 27:43.685
Till death. For the--

27:43.889 --> 27:47.598
I may not be the perfect guy
in a lot of ways...

27:47.929 --> 27:52.047
...but l"m the right guy
because nobody will love you like me.

27:58.689 --> 28:03.922
Please marry me.
Because l"m shit without you.

28:05.969 --> 28:08.005
How romantic.

28:08.209 --> 28:12.122
A marriage proposal
that contains the word "shit."

28:12.609 --> 28:14.565
Sorry.

28:14.889 --> 28:18.006
Okay, just hold on, Fay.
Janet, door.

28:18.209 --> 28:20.325
Can you believe he did that?

28:20.569 --> 28:26.087
I swear, I would rather die than marry
Ray. I don"t care what my father says.

28:27.569 --> 28:29.241
Bev...

28:29.449 --> 28:32.964
...I know this sounds horrible...

28:33.449 --> 28:38.204
...but my aunt fell down the stairs
when she was preg-- You know.

28:38.409 --> 28:40.684
And she...

28:40.889 --> 28:42.880
...you know.

28:43.089 --> 28:46.798
And I thought maybe you could--
You know?

28:47.449 --> 28:49.280
Good night, Fay.

28:51.209 --> 28:53.040
Janet?

28:56.489 --> 29:00.880
l"II give you five bucks
if you throw me down the stairs.

29:02.129 --> 29:03.721
No!

29:04.129 --> 29:07.326
Janet? You"d better be asleep!

29:44.129 --> 29:45.403
What was that?

29:45.729 --> 29:47.321
What are they doing?

29:47.649 --> 29:48.877
I don"t know.

29:49.089 --> 29:51.364
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

30:02.889 --> 30:04.686
Dear Mom and <i>P</i> op.:

30:35.569 --> 30:38.242
Wow. That"s really good writing.

-Yeah?
-Yeah.

After they"re married,
they"II move into the rec room. Right?

31:15.249 --> 31:18.082
That"s not the plan
I have in mind.

31:20.889 --> 31:23.722
l"ve decided what"s best
for my f uture...

31:24.369 --> 31:26.758
...is not getting married.

31:27.609 --> 31:31.602
As you can see f rom my letter,
I have a flair for writing.

31:32.009 --> 31:34.603
-So my plan is--
-Plan?

31:35.369 --> 31:36.484
You have a plan?

31:38.449 --> 31:39.962
You have a plan.

31:40.569 --> 31:42.446
Well, I had a plan too.

31:43.929 --> 31:47.922
I was gonna work hard,
raise a good family...

31:48.569 --> 31:50.446
...hold my head up proud.

31:51.769 --> 31:53.043
That plan"s dead.

31:55.609 --> 31:56.962
Know what I thought?

31:58.289 --> 32:00.166
No. No, I better not.

32:03.769 --> 32:08.047
Go ahead.
Say whatever you want.

32:12.649 --> 32:14.128
You were special.

32:16.049 --> 32:17.846
And you ruined your life.

32:19.889 --> 32:21.322
And you broke my heart.

32:31.969 --> 32:33.322
I just....

32:33.849 --> 32:35.248
Say something.

32:43.209 --> 32:45.120
Leo, it"II be okay.

32:45.489 --> 32:47.320
Don"t cry, Pop. Please.

32:48.049 --> 32:51.405
Mom"s right.
Everything will be okay.

32:52.689 --> 32:54.645
We"re gonna get married...

32:55.769 --> 32:57.441
...because we"re in love...

32:58.929 --> 33:01.124
...and we"re gonna get married.

33:05.929 --> 33:07.328
Ex cuse me!

33:07.889 --> 33:10.483
-You"re late.
-You know my parents.

33:10.729 --> 33:12.321
I had to sneak out.

33:12.569 --> 33:13.922
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

33:14.289 --> 33:17.918
-What"s the shoe polish for?
-Decorating the car, silly.

33:19.289 --> 33:22.247
I got her some Green Stamps.
I hope it"s okay.

33:22.449 --> 33:24.201
Please, stand still.

33:24.569 --> 33:25.797
-Sexy.
-Stop it.

33:26.009 --> 33:27.203
Stop hitting her.

33:27.769 --> 33:29.964
-Come on. I can"t get it.
-Please!

33:30.649 --> 33:33.402
-Stop moving around. You ready?
-Stop!

33:33.609 --> 33:35.201
All right? Do I got it?

33:35.409 --> 33:39.084
-Take the picture!
-Don"t yell in f ront of the church!

33:39.369 --> 33:41.485
Take the picture, will you?!

33:41.969 --> 33:44.358
-Everybody stand still.
-My baby.

33:45.689 --> 33:47.202
That was a good one.

33:47.729 --> 33:49.799
-Can I have some more?
-Yeah.

33:56.569 --> 34:00.278
-Can we get some more wine, please?
-Don"t!

34:04.209 --> 34:05.767
Sorry.

34:05.969 --> 34:08.358
Okay, this is for Bobby.

34:27.089 --> 34:29.000
-Say something.
-I got it.

34:33.728 --> 34:36.038
-This is a wedding.
-Let her finish!

34:36.329 --> 34:37.648
Thank you. l"m sorry.

34:37.849 --> 34:39.918
Save it for the Vietnamese.

34:40.129 --> 34:43.485
-I love you, Bobby.
-I love you too.

34:50.009 --> 34:53.001
When I get back,
we"re starting our own garage.

34:53.208 --> 34:57.088
Cars, bikes,
l"m thinking maybe even trucks.

34:57.289 --> 34:58.642
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

35:01.169 --> 35:04.127
That"s great!
Because between you and me...

35:05.329 --> 35:09.481
...I had no idea
how I was gonna make a living.

35:10.689 --> 35:13.328
-Lovely affair.
-Thanks. They need it.

35:13.689 --> 35:15.884
No, give it to Teresa.

35:16.089 --> 35:19.399
-She can"t hear.
-To Teresa! l"II keep it.

35:19.649 --> 35:21.162
-No!
-Give me that!

35:26.129 --> 35:29.326
Thank you.
I really like the macaroni salad.

35:36.049 --> 35:37.482
Watch this. Go!

35:39.409 --> 35:41.127
Bev, look at Tina.

35:41.489 --> 35:42.717
And Kevin.

35:51.089 --> 35:52.647
She loves to dance.

35:55.889 --> 35:57.641
Beautif ul.

36:00.369 --> 36:01.882
Janet, you were great.

36:03.089 --> 36:05.603
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Tony.

36:05.969 --> 36:10.121
Thank you. We"re going to take
an intermission to eat.

36:10.449 --> 36:13.646
We"II be back. Thank you very much.

36:16.209 --> 36:18.564
You should have danced.

36:20.689 --> 36:22.566
What"s the matter?

36:23.249 --> 36:24.682
What?

36:24.889 --> 36:28.006
My father never asked me to dance.

36:28.369 --> 36:31.406
He"s embarrassed to be seen with me.

36:32.129 --> 36:33.403
You"re crazy.

36:34.129 --> 36:36.484
Nobody"s ashamed
to be seen with you.

36:36.689 --> 36:39.567
How come no one"s come to say hi?

36:39.769 --> 36:43.398
l"m the bride. The only person
to even look at me...

36:43.609 --> 36:48.160
...is crazy Aunt Mildy, who"s
calling me Agnes, my dead cousin.

36:48.369 --> 36:50.280
-Agnes!
-Hi, Mildy.

36:51.569 --> 36:52.968
-Know what?
-I love you!

36:53.329 --> 36:56.162
Who cares about them? Right?

36:57.049 --> 36:59.927
No, I know what"s gonna happen.

37:00.209 --> 37:04.999
When you graduate, you"II get sent
to a fancy school. l"II be alone.

37:07.089 --> 37:08.966
With a kid.

37:09.169 --> 37:11.478
-Let"s hear a speech.
-Good idea!

37:11.729 --> 37:14.448
-Speech! Speech!
-Tony, drum roll.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.048
All right!

37:24.369 --> 37:28.885
There are times in a man"s life
when there is cause to celebrate.

37:29.729 --> 37:33.165
-See?
-And finding f riends is easy.

37:34.929 --> 37:37.443
But then there are times like this.

37:37.689 --> 37:42.126
And if people are still there,
those are his real f riends.

37:43.409 --> 37:45.206
His real family.

37:46.809 --> 37:49.448
We all know what brought us here.

37:50.289 --> 37:54.680
And the fact you still
saw it in your hearts to come....

37:58.449 --> 37:59.928
Well, you"re in my...

38:01.849 --> 38:04.044
...my heart forever.

38:05.769 --> 38:09.364
-Salud.
-Salud <i>!</i>

38:11.249 --> 38:15.003
Now you can go back and eat.
And finish eating.

38:18.969 --> 38:20.880
-Wasn"t that nice?
-Beautif ul!

38:21.209 --> 38:23.404
-Beautif ul!
-Thanks. Sit down.

38:27.089 --> 38:29.603
She"s not gonna sing again, is she?

38:32.369 --> 38:33.802
Hi.

38:34.449 --> 38:36.679
My name is Fay.

38:37.409 --> 38:39.877
And l"m Bev"s best f riend.

38:41.849 --> 38:43.965
I just wanted to say...

38:44.609 --> 38:47.567
...how beautif ul Bev looks tonight.

38:47.769 --> 38:50.761
And to wish her
all the happiness in the world.

38:51.609 --> 38:56.125
Now that l"ve said it,
maybe one of you could say it too.

38:58.689 --> 39:03.809
Sitting over there is a girl who
has a light around her.

39:04.049 --> 39:05.323
It"s the chair.

39:05.569 --> 39:09.357
When you"re near her,
something ex citing will happen.

39:09.809 --> 39:13.484
If you think you deserve a medal
for being here...

39:13.689 --> 39:15.566
...due to the circumstances--

39:15.769 --> 39:19.398
-That"s enough--
-No. Wait, l"m not finished yet.

39:20.049 --> 39:24.725
If you"re so great for being here,
don"t talk to me, either.

39:25.449 --> 39:26.882
Okay?

39:30.689 --> 39:32.600
Because l"m pregnant too.

39:36.049 --> 39:37.448
She"s what?

39:37.689 --> 39:39.247
-Congratulations.
-Really?

39:39.689 --> 39:41.600
-Did you know?
-No.

39:42.289 --> 39:43.881
It"s an epidemic.

39:44.089 --> 39:45.647
Go back to eating now.

39:46.129 --> 39:47.608
Salud.

39:47.809 --> 39:50.369
-Tony!
-Come on, put the food down.

39:53.169 --> 39:57.128
Zippy, ask your cousin to dance.
Janet, dance with Zippy.

39:57.329 --> 39:59.081
I don"t know what to say.

40:00.729 --> 40:03.084
-Swear you"re not joking.
-I swear.

40:03.409 --> 40:05.320
I found out two days ago.

40:05.929 --> 40:08.204
I had to tell Bobby first.
Sorry.

40:08.409 --> 40:11.765
-It"s okay.
-It"s not. There"s no ceremony.

40:11.969 --> 40:14.767
We"re getting married
before he ships out.

40:14.969 --> 40:18.439
My father wanted me
to live with my brother...

40:18.689 --> 40:22.602
...and put the baby up for adoption,
but Mom said no.

40:22.809 --> 40:24.765
That"s what"s going on.

40:26.929 --> 40:29.397
We"re gonna be pregnant together!

40:31.089 --> 40:33.683
And we"re both gonna have girls!

40:35.769 --> 40:38.727
And they"re gonna be just like us!

40:47.409 --> 40:49.400
She"s crazy.

40:52.609 --> 40:54.440
-Keep them closed!
-All right.

40:54.769 --> 40:57.124
-Where are we? Fay?
-No peeking.

40:57.729 --> 40:59.720
-l"m right here.
-You coming?

41:00.009 --> 41:03.399
You want to come in? Bobby!

41:03.929 --> 41:05.328
Fay Forrester!

41:05.809 --> 41:07.561
l"II write f rom Vietnam!

41:07.769 --> 41:10.647
They had to leave.
Keep going.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.642
Keep them closed.

41:13.849 --> 41:16.886
-Keep them closed.
-What are you doing?

41:17.489 --> 41:19.081
Bend the knee.

41:20.489 --> 41:23.083
-My God. All right.
-Okay.

41:24.049 --> 41:26.085
Keep them closed.
All right.

41:26.289 --> 41:28.166
-l"m caught.
-It"s all right.

41:28.369 --> 41:32.487
-Where are we going?
-Don"t open them until I say.

41:32.889 --> 41:34.481
Okay!

41:36.209 --> 41:38.120
Okay, open your eyes!

41:39.609 --> 41:41.679
Open your eyes, come on.

41:49.449 --> 41:51.724
-What is it?
-What is it?

41:51.929 --> 41:55.763
This is our place!
This is where we"re gonna live!

41:55.969 --> 41:58.688
-How"d you do this?
-I talked to your father.

41:58.889 --> 42:01.449
He got us public housing.

42:01.689 --> 42:03.042
He helped you?

42:04.049 --> 42:08.327
Us. I think he was glad
that I came to him.

42:08.569 --> 42:12.801
I figured you didn"t want
to be under their rules anymore.

42:13.009 --> 42:15.842
Look. This is a great stove. Really.

42:16.049 --> 42:19.928
It goes all the way to 550.
That"s like lava. Hot.

42:21.329 --> 42:23.285
Close your eyes.

42:25.009 --> 42:26.442
Okay.

42:27.409 --> 42:32.529
Very few people in my life
have treated me as good as you do.

42:32.729 --> 42:35.402
That has to mean
something good, right?

42:35.609 --> 42:37.327
I don"t know.

42:39.409 --> 42:44.608
Tonight I have an amazing feeling,
like everything"s gonna be okay.

42:46.289 --> 42:48.086
And...

42:52.049 --> 42:53.880
...l"m done.

43:00.209 --> 43:03.201
Our own home.

43:03.409 --> 43:07.846
-Ray, this is going to be so much f un!
-It"s good, huh?

43:08.049 --> 43:12.361
My God! I can"t believe it!
No parents! Our own house!

43:13.449 --> 43:16.805
Last night, I fought Ray
for the last piece of chicken.

43:17.009 --> 43:20.046
I said, "If you don"t let go,
l"II kill you!"

43:20.249 --> 43:22.922
l"m starting to scare myself, Fay.

43:23.129 --> 43:26.405
It"s good Bobby"s away
because I get all the food.

43:26.649 --> 43:31.245
No fights. It"s a better marriage
because of it. You okay?

43:31.769 --> 43:33.487
She"s kicking.

43:33.969 --> 43:35.561
Mine too.

43:35.769 --> 43:37.964
Let"s let them play together.

43:41.969 --> 43:44.199
Beverly! Fay!

43:44.489 --> 43:46.047
-Hi, Tina.
-Tina!

43:46.649 --> 43:49.038
We"re on our way to junior prom.

43:49.489 --> 43:51.559
l"II tell you all about it.

43:51.769 --> 43:54.044
-Bye, girls!
-You got really big.

43:54.249 --> 43:57.047
That was genuinely insensitive!

43:59.409 --> 44:02.765
It"s hot, I know.
l"m doing the floor.

44:06.289 --> 44:10.567
Where is he? He was supposed to
be here three hours ago.

44:11.009 --> 44:16.129
-I missed my appointment.
-What"II they say that"s new?

44:17.169 --> 44:21.560
l"m two weeks late.
Why won"t this thing come out?!

44:21.889 --> 44:24.357
That "thing" is very smart.

44:24.649 --> 44:27.288
It"s not coming out
until you"re ready.

44:28.609 --> 44:31.169
What are you doing?
You"re making a mess.

44:37.889 --> 44:39.641
Pull. Pull.

44:42.129 --> 44:44.245
l"II clean it up.

44:45.009 --> 44:48.558
-You"re three hours late!
-l"m sorry.

44:48.849 --> 44:50.282
-You"re drunk.
-No.

44:50.569 --> 44:54.801
-You were with Lizzard!
-No! My boss.

44:56.449 --> 44:57.723
Bev, come on.

44:57.969 --> 44:59.288
Bev.

44:59.609 --> 45:01.122
What are you doing?

45:01.329 --> 45:02.842
l"m locking him out!

45:03.089 --> 45:06.843
Come on!
Open up or else l"Il--

45:07.089 --> 45:10.559
What? Break it down?
You"II break your neck.

45:10.809 --> 45:12.208
Enough of this.

45:12.569 --> 45:15.447
-Where are you going?
-l"m not staying.

45:18.489 --> 45:21.879
I didn"t break my neck.
Hi, Ma.

45:22.129 --> 45:23.801
-Hi, Raymond.
-You idiot!

45:24.009 --> 45:28.161
We can"t afford a crib,
and you broke the window!

45:28.369 --> 45:31.600
What am I supposed to do?
Tell my boss that--

45:31.889 --> 45:33.481
Oh, Raymond.

45:33.809 --> 45:35.925
You"re bleeding.

45:36.409 --> 45:37.683
l"m bleeding!

45:38.849 --> 45:42.444
You"re getting it on the floor.
And on the wall!

45:42.729 --> 45:44.640
-Stop bleeding!
-l"m trying!

45:44.929 --> 45:47.397
-Stop bleeding!
-Shut up.

45:47.729 --> 45:50.289
Start moving.
Come on!

45:50.489 --> 45:54.641
Get some peroxide and toilet paper.
Hurry up!

45:54.849 --> 45:57.158
-Is there glass in there?
-No!

45:57.369 --> 46:00.566
Waddle <i>q</i> uicker!
He"s bleeding to death!

46:00.929 --> 46:02.442
Hold it tight.

46:04.609 --> 46:06.964
It was my boss.
I had to go.

46:07.249 --> 46:09.001
Raymond?
Look at me.

46:09.489 --> 46:12.208
You"re the man of this house.

46:12.449 --> 46:17.364
Bring home the bacon.
If you say you"II be here, be here!

46:17.609 --> 46:19.725
-No lying, no drinking!
-Mom!

46:19.929 --> 46:22.204
-What?
-Help!

46:22.409 --> 46:24.127
Help! Come on!

46:26.049 --> 46:27.004
What?

46:29.209 --> 46:31.120
What"s happening?

46:33.969 --> 46:35.402
Oh, Bev.

46:36.409 --> 46:39.765
-Your water broke.
-What?

46:40.849 --> 46:43.602
Is that supposed to happen?

46:44.449 --> 46:48.203
-l"m so ex cited.
-This is so gross.

46:57.249 --> 47:01.037
Hello, beautif ul.
Hello, beautif ul baby.

47:01.369 --> 47:05.248
Is this the most
beautif ul baby you"ve ever seen?

47:05.969 --> 47:10.121
l"m serious. Is this the most
beautif ul baby you"ve seen?

47:10.489 --> 47:13.208
Well, to be honest, yeah.

47:14.049 --> 47:17.359
Let"s go see Bev.
She wants to see you.

47:17.729 --> 47:19.606
Come on, it"II be f un.

47:20.209 --> 47:24.646
Mommy"s 15, Daddy"s a moron,
and they want us to celebrate.

47:24.929 --> 47:26.157
We know better.

47:26.449 --> 47:28.917
l"II be back later.
Come on, Leo.

47:29.169 --> 47:31.967
For the record,
l"m on your side.

47:46.769 --> 47:49.363
Mr. and Mrs. Hasek,
I have your baby.

47:49.729 --> 47:52.368
Hey, can you wait one second?

47:54.889 --> 47:56.083
Hey, Bev.

47:59.689 --> 48:02.123
l"m sorry I broke your water.

48:02.649 --> 48:05.880
Nothing like that
will ever happen again.

48:06.169 --> 48:10.447
No more drinking.
No more forgetting.

48:10.849 --> 48:13.647
l"m gonna be good, okay?

48:15.249 --> 48:17.763
I love you so much.

48:32.729 --> 48:37.041
This is one of the most beautif ul
baby boys l"ve ever seen.

48:37.369 --> 48:40.008
I didn"t have a boy,
I had a girl.

48:40.209 --> 48:43.406
No, we had a boy.
Don"t you remember?

48:45.969 --> 48:48.403
I told Fay we"d both have girls...

48:48.649 --> 48:51.482
...and they"d be just like us.

48:51.969 --> 48:54.278
No, we had a boy.

48:54.649 --> 48:58.119
He"s going to grow up
and be just like me.

48:59.609 --> 49:02.487
Try feeding him for a little while.

49:02.809 --> 49:05.881
l"II be back in 20 minutes.

49:07.809 --> 49:09.367
l"II try.

49:15.609 --> 49:17.201
It"s a boy.

49:19.769 --> 49:23.239
-It sure is.
-It"s a boy.

49:26.809 --> 49:28.561
No!

49:34.169 --> 49:37.400
Hydrogen, helium,
lithium, beryllium....

49:37.649 --> 49:40.561
We"re gonna get a good one.
Ready?

49:40.849 --> 49:43.283
Hold that! Ready?
Click.

49:43.809 --> 49:47.404
Jason and Amelia,
sitting in a tree...

49:48.249 --> 49:51.924
...while Bev is getting
her high school degree.

49:59.689 --> 50:01.361
l"m trying to study.

50:01.969 --> 50:05.325
Ten more minutes.
Be <i>q</i> uiet for a minute.

50:05.649 --> 50:07.128
Jason, God!

50:07.489 --> 50:09.320
Can"t he hit the bowl?

50:14.289 --> 50:16.086
You"re distracting me.

50:17.369 --> 50:18.643
Ma!

50:20.369 --> 50:23.247
-What?
-Jason won"t leave me alone!

50:23.609 --> 50:25.565
You"re his mother.

50:26.049 --> 50:30.327
I got four weeks to study
for the SAT, for the scholarship.

50:31.009 --> 50:34.285
I know you"re smart,
and you have dreams.

50:34.569 --> 50:36.161
But you need a job.

50:36.369 --> 50:39.167
This one pays for living expenses.

50:41.889 --> 50:45.723
I told you to change his diaper
an hour ago.

50:46.289 --> 50:48.359
He loves when you do it.

50:49.369 --> 50:51.963
-I have to iron now.
-Ma!

50:52.249 --> 50:53.398
Change it!

50:54.009 --> 50:55.761
Mommy has to study.

50:55.969 --> 50:59.757
l"m doing everything I can
to get us out of here.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.805
Mr. Stinky Pants.

51:04.929 --> 51:06.282
What happened?

51:07.609 --> 51:09.008
What?!

51:10.169 --> 51:11.761
What happened?

51:12.449 --> 51:14.326
He peed in my mouth!

51:21.209 --> 51:22.801
Come here, Jason.

51:23.129 --> 51:24.926
Come on, big boy.

51:26.849 --> 51:28.999
Jason, God bless you.

51:29.329 --> 51:34.164
You make your grandma so happy.
Mommy pee-pee mouth.

51:36.209 --> 51:39.007
-l"II get this one.
-What do I do?

51:40.769 --> 51:42.839
Let"s throw some more.

51:43.129 --> 51:44.244
Check it out.

51:44.929 --> 51:49.719
-I don"t have any rocks.
-You don"t need rocks after this.

51:51.929 --> 51:54.204
Yeah! All right!

51:54.409 --> 51:58.004
You okay?
How long you been sick?

51:58.809 --> 52:00.367
About ten--

52:05.049 --> 52:07.927
Hey, Al, l"m done for the day.

52:09.049 --> 52:10.562
All right, man.

52:10.849 --> 52:13.647
-See you tomorrow.
-On time, okay?

52:24.089 --> 52:28.560
-I see it.
-That"s because we screwed up.

52:29.489 --> 52:31.081
I said to him:

52:32.249 --> 52:33.887
"B-O-B-B-Y...

52:34.449 --> 52:39.000
...if you re-enlist,
I want a D-l-V-O-R-C-E."

52:40.209 --> 52:43.007
I got the guts to say it.

52:43.289 --> 52:44.927
Know what he said?

52:47.129 --> 52:48.562
He wanted one too.

52:51.609 --> 52:54.169
Sorry to bother you with this.

52:54.449 --> 52:56.724
Mom, we"re stuck.

52:57.089 --> 52:59.603
He"s met some girl named Monsoon.

53:00.249 --> 53:03.127
l"m here, taking care of our kid...

53:03.409 --> 53:06.845
...he"s on some beach,
falling in love with Monsoon.

53:07.049 --> 53:09.404
What kind of name is Monsoon?

53:09.729 --> 53:11.879
-Good.
-That"s good?

53:12.089 --> 53:14.284
We know Bobby"s not coming back.

53:14.569 --> 53:19.120
-What"re you gonna do with your life?
-I don"t know.

53:19.329 --> 53:20.557
Mommy!

53:22.049 --> 53:25.883
Fay has bigger problems right now.
Be considerate.

53:27.289 --> 53:28.563
What am I gonna do?

53:28.929 --> 53:31.887
You"re a great artist.
Do something with that.

53:32.089 --> 53:35.399
-Like what?
-Like me and my scholarship.

53:35.769 --> 53:39.398
-l"m not as smart as you.
-l"II help you.

53:40.369 --> 53:43.918
-Just you and me.
-It"s always you and me.

53:47.809 --> 53:49.208
Yeah!

53:51.249 --> 53:54.047
I can wear it and return it.

54:00.729 --> 54:02.606
Can you finish me up?

54:05.049 --> 54:06.323
Perf ume.

54:08.409 --> 54:10.240
Ready, go.

54:10.449 --> 54:12.360
Okay, put it down.

54:20.929 --> 54:22.282
Come on.

54:24.729 --> 54:28.358
-How do I look?
-You look beautif ul, Mommy.

54:29.209 --> 54:31.769
No, say that I look smart.

54:32.369 --> 54:35.122
You look smart, Mommy.
You do.

54:35.409 --> 54:36.762
Thank you.

54:37.049 --> 54:39.768
l"m going to drop you off
with Daddy.

54:40.569 --> 54:42.446
And then Mommy...

54:43.409 --> 54:47.448
...is gonna do something to change
the rest of our lives!

54:49.089 --> 54:50.647
Let"s go!

54:53.649 --> 54:57.688
Stay with Daddy.
Later, we"II have a celebration.

54:59.609 --> 55:02.442
-Al, where"s Ray?
-You tell me.

55:02.649 --> 55:05.083
He didn"t show up for work.

55:05.689 --> 55:08.078
He comes and goes as he pleases.

55:08.849 --> 55:10.919
I can"t believe this!

55:11.289 --> 55:14.326
-I want to stay with Daddy.
-He"s not here.

55:14.569 --> 55:17.845
You have to come with me.
Get in the cab.

55:18.169 --> 55:20.922
-I want to play.
-You"II play later.

55:21.209 --> 55:23.723
-I want to play.
-It won"t take long.

55:24.249 --> 55:27.400
Ex cuse me, where is
the interview room?

55:29.009 --> 55:30.328
Sorry.

55:32.369 --> 55:34.883
I called you for two reasons.

55:35.089 --> 55:39.401
One is to meet the girl
who wrote such a tremendous essay.

55:39.809 --> 55:44.360
The other is to compliment you
on your strong effort.

55:45.329 --> 55:48.878
It"s down to seven girls.
You should be proud.

55:49.889 --> 55:51.004
Thank you.

55:51.249 --> 55:55.083
If you pick me,
I will not let you down.

55:55.409 --> 55:58.003
l"II be everything you"re looking for.

56:04.849 --> 56:06.805
What l"m getting at...

56:07.649 --> 56:12.359
...is we want to be very sure
that the person we give this to...

56:12.569 --> 56:16.039
...will not only graduate,
but go to grad school...

56:16.249 --> 56:18.319
...and not be someone who"II be....

56:20.809 --> 56:22.288
Distracted?

56:23.009 --> 56:24.567
-Yes.
-Not me.

56:24.809 --> 56:29.644
If you give me the scholarship,
it"s like giving me my master"s.

56:29.849 --> 56:32.204
Nothing gets in my way.

56:38.369 --> 56:41.042
You probably need to get going.

56:41.689 --> 56:43.407
We"II call when we know.

56:45.569 --> 56:47.400
When will you know?

56:48.729 --> 56:50.640
Two weeks.

56:51.609 --> 56:53.998
Nice meeting you, Mrs. Hasek.

56:54.809 --> 56:59.883
Don"t make me go crazy for two weeks.
This means so much to me.

57:00.249 --> 57:01.318
Mr. Price...

57:03.409 --> 57:05.684
...l"m not gonna get this, am I?

57:09.209 --> 57:10.801
l"m sorry, no.

57:11.169 --> 57:13.080
N-O. No.

57:27.009 --> 57:28.362
Daddy!

57:29.969 --> 57:33.803
-Hey, big guy.
-Come say hello to Uncle Lizzard.

57:34.849 --> 57:37.158
Look at you. Magazine.

57:39.689 --> 57:42.601
Why do I look like this today?

57:43.289 --> 57:46.361
Why do I look nice today?

57:48.409 --> 57:51.924
The most important day of my life?

57:55.809 --> 57:57.037
Yeah.

57:58.289 --> 58:00.359
Bev, l"m sorry.

58:00.649 --> 58:02.844
No, not sorry.
Where were you?

58:03.089 --> 58:06.320
-I was, I was at--
-No. Where were you?

58:07.409 --> 58:09.764
-I had--
-No.

58:11.169 --> 58:13.125
Where were you?

58:16.929 --> 58:20.604
-Say something.
-You can"t hide behind Jason.

58:20.929 --> 58:23.966
-Yes, he can.
-I am invisible.

58:24.209 --> 58:28.760
-Help me out, boy.
-Hiding behind Jason won"t work.

58:33.209 --> 58:34.847
Answer me.

58:38.969 --> 58:41.085
I forgot.

58:42.649 --> 58:45.322
You forgot?

58:46.489 --> 58:49.799
You forgot?
You forgot?!

58:50.569 --> 58:53.003
Haven"t you had a dream?

58:53.729 --> 58:56.289
-Yeah.
-Shut up, Lizzard!

59:01.329 --> 59:04.446
I woke up this morning,
truly believing...

59:04.729 --> 59:09.007
...that by this afternoon,
my life would be different.

59:09.489 --> 59:14.643
Not only because it was my dream,
but because l"d earned it.

59:14.929 --> 59:17.204
And now look at me.

59:18.169 --> 59:22.640
It"s 4:00 in the afternoon,
and l"m just another housewife...

59:23.009 --> 59:27.321
...yelling at her husband
in f ront of the neighbors.

59:27.969 --> 59:30.278
Yeah, that"s me!

59:30.929 --> 59:33.568
Wonderf ul!
Thank you, Ray!

59:35.929 --> 59:37.806
You look smart, Mom.

59:39.129 --> 59:42.007
You do.
You look really smart.

59:42.329 --> 59:44.240
Come on, Bev.

59:44.849 --> 59:48.398
The whole college thing,
it"II work out.

59:50.289 --> 59:52.359
No, it won"t.

59:56.089 --> 59:57.807
And l"II adjust.

01:00:04.569 --> 01:00:06.161
Should I have left?

01:00:11.249 --> 01:00:13.126
I can"t do anything right!

01:00:13.329 --> 01:00:15.240
You better clean that up!

01:00:20.849 --> 01:00:24.080
/t <i>'</i> s family legend
and a huge deal in her book...

01:00:24.289 --> 01:00:26.723
... the day she didn <i>'</i> t get
her scholarship.

01:00:27.249 --> 01:00:29.558
<i>T</i> o me it <i>'</i> s not about <i>R</i> ay <i>'</i> s mistake.

01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:32.118
/t <i>'</i> s about ho <i>w</i> my mere presence...

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:35.605
...forever crushed
all my mother <i>'</i> s dreams.

01:00:37.729 --> 01:00:41.483
Is this a comfortable silence for you?

01:00:42.849 --> 01:00:44.202
Yes.

01:00:50.049 --> 01:00:54.645
Are we gonna do this all day?
You not telling me what"s wrong.

01:00:59.609 --> 01:01:02.328
Okay, l"II tell you.

01:01:02.929 --> 01:01:04.999
But promise not to go crazy.

01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:06.762
I won"t go crazy.

01:01:13.889 --> 01:01:16.084
I think I should transfer schools.

01:01:16.409 --> 01:01:20.084
Instead of NYU,
I think Indiana might be nice.

01:01:21.889 --> 01:01:24.039
-No.
-Let me finish! l"ve--

01:01:24.569 --> 01:01:27.606
I don"t want to hear it.
The answer is no.

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:30.118
Two years and you"re finished.

01:01:31.129 --> 01:01:35.964
You"II be a college graduate.
You"II have the life I dreamed of.

01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:40.681
Vic, these are for Mimi.

01:01:42.009 --> 01:01:43.442
Hi, Bev.

01:01:43.809 --> 01:01:46.642
We"d like 17 delux e
Delite burgers, please.

01:01:47.009 --> 01:01:49.477
No, make that twenty Delite f ries.

01:01:49.809 --> 01:01:52.846
And 20 Delite cones.

01:01:55.409 --> 01:01:57.877
Eleven dollars.
Twenty f ries.

01:01:58.129 --> 01:02:01.360
Looks like Bev finally found
a job that suits her.

01:02:07.609 --> 01:02:08.564
They"re ready.

01:02:10.049 --> 01:02:12.244
Ready? Here you go.

01:02:13.569 --> 01:02:16.367
Hit it right there.
Hit the chief.

01:02:19.729 --> 01:02:21.003
Right here.

01:02:24.129 --> 01:02:27.963
Please, thank you.
No yelling.

01:02:29.569 --> 01:02:33.482
And smile, okay?
Even if she is a real bitch.

01:02:35.009 --> 01:02:38.160
Mrs. Forrester.
Nice to see you.

01:02:39.969 --> 01:02:41.482
Is Fay home?

01:02:42.649 --> 01:02:46.437
I swear, I haven"t smiled in a month.

01:02:47.449 --> 01:02:51.078
Your mom taking the kids
to the movies is great.

01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:52.563
Shut the door.

01:02:55.769 --> 01:02:57.680
Play nice, kids.

01:03:01.329 --> 01:03:04.878
-What are these?
-Ray gave me two of them.

01:03:05.169 --> 01:03:08.081
What are they?
I don"t want to see my skull.

01:03:08.889 --> 01:03:12.120
Ray always wants me
to take them with him.

01:03:12.369 --> 01:03:16.760
He says they"re great to take
with someone you love and trust.

01:03:26.809 --> 01:03:28.640
-Fay?
-Yeah.

01:03:28.849 --> 01:03:33.969
-Do you love Amelia?
-Oh, man, don"t get heavy on me now.

01:03:34.169 --> 01:03:35.602
It"s a real <i>q</i> uestion.

01:03:36.289 --> 01:03:39.964
-We didn"t pick this.
-Because we got knocked up?

01:03:41.649 --> 01:03:47.599
-Romance took a strange turn for us.
-Yeah, we got knocked up.

01:03:50.449 --> 01:03:54.328
I want to thank your mom.
Mrs. Forrester....

01:03:54.569 --> 01:03:59.643
l"d love to forgive each other for
whatever keeps us f rom being close.

01:04:00.209 --> 01:04:03.087
You"ve probably said
awf ul things about me.

01:04:03.409 --> 01:04:07.243
And you probably heard me
call you "ice crotch."

01:04:07.649 --> 01:04:11.437
-I thought you hated me.
-Amelia.

01:04:12.969 --> 01:04:17.645
-l"m taking Amelia to the movies.
-What about Jason?

01:04:17.849 --> 01:04:20.283
His mommy is leaving soon.

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:24.277
I wouldn"t want her to leave
without him. Let"s go.

01:04:25.049 --> 01:04:26.641
Bye, sweetie.

01:04:26.969 --> 01:04:31.087
-She loved hearing that.
-It just fell out of my mouth.

01:04:34.769 --> 01:04:39.604
-Go inside and watch TV.
-I want to stay here with you.

01:04:39.889 --> 01:04:44.644
l"m having a hard time with you here,
and I need to talk to Fay.

01:04:45.929 --> 01:04:48.841
-Go.
-I don"t have anything to do.

01:04:49.329 --> 01:04:52.799
Well, use your imagination!

01:04:56.209 --> 01:04:57.483
Go.

01:05:07.049 --> 01:05:08.004
So?

01:05:08.369 --> 01:05:11.247
So? What was the <i>q</i> uestion?

01:05:11.769 --> 01:05:12.918
Do you love Amelia?

01:05:13.969 --> 01:05:16.961
Yes, I love her.
And you love Jason.

01:05:17.649 --> 01:05:20.402
-Right?
-Yeah, I love him, but....

01:05:20.729 --> 01:05:22.367
You love him but what?

01:05:24.209 --> 01:05:28.885
I don"t know if I really love him
or I have to love him.

01:05:32.049 --> 01:05:35.246
And it scares me to death.

01:05:40.369 --> 01:05:43.566
Good people don"t think this way.

01:05:47.409 --> 01:05:50.446
-What"s wrong with me?
-Bev?

01:05:51.409 --> 01:05:53.161
Take my word on this.

01:05:55.209 --> 01:05:57.643
You really do love him.

01:05:58.129 --> 01:06:02.964
Sometimes we love people so much,
we have to be numb to it.

01:06:04.729 --> 01:06:08.085
If we actually felt how much,
it would kill us.

01:06:14.289 --> 01:06:19.727
That doesn"t make you a bad person.
It means your heart"s too big.

01:06:26.129 --> 01:06:28.199
Good way to look at it.

01:06:29.849 --> 01:06:31.282
Mom, help!

01:06:34.809 --> 01:06:37.482
Stay calm, stay calm.
Don"t panic.

01:06:42.769 --> 01:06:45.602
-Get over here.
-Got him?

01:06:45.889 --> 01:06:48.528
Don"t pull him out yet.
He"II f reeze.

01:06:48.729 --> 01:06:51.402
-l"m sorry.
-l"II get towels.

01:06:51.649 --> 01:06:56.962
This shouldn"t have happened.
From now on, l"II be more attentive.

01:06:57.289 --> 01:06:59.598
-Do you know what that means?
-No.

01:06:59.809 --> 01:07:03.085
Responsible.
You know what responsible means?

01:07:03.409 --> 01:07:04.558
No.

01:07:05.169 --> 01:07:07.683
I should have read to you more!

01:07:07.889 --> 01:07:09.481
No! Come here!

01:07:10.809 --> 01:07:12.640
l"m so sorry!

01:07:15.929 --> 01:07:19.399
-l"m a terrible mother.
-Yeah.

01:07:34.969 --> 01:07:36.197
Scoot.

01:07:37.489 --> 01:07:38.444
Jason.

01:07:40.569 --> 01:07:41.797
I love you.

01:07:44.089 --> 01:07:45.317
Okay?

01:07:49.009 --> 01:07:51.603
They"re playing kickball.

01:07:52.209 --> 01:07:53.961
Go play with them.

01:07:55.609 --> 01:07:57.645
Adults inside, kids outside.

01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:11.284
That"s $20! You know how
much you can buy with that?

01:08:12.809 --> 01:08:16.085
My parents always
bought stuff I hated.

01:08:16.368 --> 01:08:18.644
The card is the real present.

01:08:19.089 --> 01:08:23.241
I got carried away,
but it"s a plan for your life.

01:08:23.609 --> 01:08:25.327
Here, l"II read it to you.

01:08:26.288 --> 01:08:28.041
-"Dearest Jason--"
-Mom?

01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:36.680
We"II catch up later.
Are you ready to go have f un?

01:08:38.328 --> 01:08:39.648
Okay, good.

01:08:43.129 --> 01:08:44.403
Go have f un.

01:08:44.729 --> 01:08:46.799
Everybody, come in.

01:08:48.089 --> 01:08:49.442
Hi, Amelia.

01:08:49.689 --> 01:08:52.840
Davy, I got your stuff.
Get it later.

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:57.808
-The card was the present?
-It"s a plan for my life.

01:08:58.129 --> 01:09:00.962
-She"s crazy!
-You guys be caref ul.

01:09:05.009 --> 01:09:06.362
What?

01:09:08.689 --> 01:09:11.600
Minimum wage is what,
one-sixty an hour?

01:09:11.889 --> 01:09:15.404
l"II pay $160,
just to use your oven.

01:09:16.368 --> 01:09:20.885
I don"t think my parents will let you
use their oven to dry weed.

01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:28.568
-Oh, Bev.
-I made it for him.

01:09:28.769 --> 01:09:29.997
You did a great job.

01:09:30.649 --> 01:09:33.368
You stayed up all night?
It looks delicious.

01:09:33.929 --> 01:09:35.078
You hog!

01:09:40.569 --> 01:09:41.843
Get me another beer.

01:09:42.049 --> 01:09:44.563
-l"m way ahead of you.
-Make it two.

01:09:50.288 --> 01:09:51.608
Bev?

01:09:55.409 --> 01:09:58.162
Don"t tell me you don"t remember me.

01:10:01.689 --> 01:10:05.807
Braces, short curly hair, pimples.

01:10:06.329 --> 01:10:08.285
Tommy?

01:10:10.649 --> 01:10:11.923
Wow.

01:10:15.129 --> 01:10:17.962
-So I graduated f rom Berkeley.
-Berkeley?

01:10:18.169 --> 01:10:21.718
Spent the year driving around,
seeing everything.

01:10:22.809 --> 01:10:27.087
In a few days l"m heading back
to California to get my master"s.

01:10:27.409 --> 01:10:29.843
But I wanted to see you first.

01:10:30.089 --> 01:10:32.364
-You wanted to see me?
-Yeah.

01:10:32.609 --> 01:10:34.440
Just to say hi.

01:10:35.889 --> 01:10:37.641
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:10:39.329 --> 01:10:41.843
-Bev! Hey, Bev!
-Ex cuse me.

01:10:43.089 --> 01:10:45.159
-Tina!
-Bev.

01:10:45.809 --> 01:10:47.288
You actually came!

01:10:47.489 --> 01:10:49.798
-l"m so glad.
-Of course I came.

01:10:50.809 --> 01:10:54.563
-This is f rom Joey.
-Joey.

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:57.682
Joe got you something?

01:10:58.009 --> 01:10:59.283
Thanks, Joe.

01:11:02.089 --> 01:11:05.479
-That"s outside. Outside toy.
-Stop.

01:11:05.729 --> 01:11:10.325
-Come in and say hi.
-I can"t. Kevin"s waiting by the car.

01:11:12.129 --> 01:11:13.403
This is fiberglass.

01:11:14.049 --> 01:11:16.199
I just came to say goodbye.

01:11:16.409 --> 01:11:19.765
-What do you mean?
-Kevin and I are engaged.

01:11:20.369 --> 01:11:22.644
-You"re pregnant.
-No.

01:11:22.849 --> 01:11:27.365
Kevin"s been in school in New York.
He can"t stand being away f rom me.

01:11:27.609 --> 01:11:31.966
I wanted to tell you before
you heard it. l"m going to college.

01:11:33.449 --> 01:11:38.045
Kevin"s father got me into
that real good college in New York.

01:11:38.369 --> 01:11:40.883
-NYU?
-Yeah.

01:11:42.929 --> 01:11:46.046
-You"re going to NYU?
-Yeah.

01:11:46.249 --> 01:11:49.798
Holy shit. It"s Jackie O.
Come here!

01:11:50.089 --> 01:11:52.000
Fay, the divorcée!

01:11:52.209 --> 01:11:56.168
This is the only thing
my father ever gave me.

01:11:57.329 --> 01:12:00.480
It"s supposed to be lucky,
but it wasn"t for him.

01:12:00.729 --> 01:12:04.802
And it hasn"t been for me.
Maybe it"II be lucky for you.

01:12:05.009 --> 01:12:06.283
Maybe it"s stupid.

01:12:07.729 --> 01:12:08.957
I couldn"t wrap it.

01:12:09.169 --> 01:12:14.038
They"re not stupid. They"re great!
I love your guts, Dad!

01:12:14.249 --> 01:12:16.683
I love your guts too, buddy.

01:12:18.249 --> 01:12:22.037
Bye! I love you guys!
l"II call, okay? I swear!

01:12:22.249 --> 01:12:24.479
-Bye, girls!
-Bye!

01:12:24.729 --> 01:12:27.289
Come visit me in New York, okay?

01:12:44.689 --> 01:12:45.883
Hey.

01:12:48.849 --> 01:12:50.407
Sorry.

01:12:51.089 --> 01:12:52.807
Did I scare you?

01:12:53.449 --> 01:12:55.246
No.

01:12:56.129 --> 01:12:58.085
What are you doing here?

01:12:58.289 --> 01:13:01.122
I wanted to see if you were okay.

01:13:02.129 --> 01:13:03.608
You okay?

01:13:09.449 --> 01:13:11.167
Wanna go for a walk?

01:13:15.729 --> 01:13:19.005
-Maybe just around the....
-Good. Come on.

01:13:26.809 --> 01:13:29.607
Tell me what you"re thinking
right now.

01:13:29.969 --> 01:13:33.928
l"m 22 years old.
That"s almost 30.

01:13:34.129 --> 01:13:37.485
I still haven"t accepted
that this is my life.

01:13:38.769 --> 01:13:43.126
I wish I could be dumb
and then I wouldn"t know better.

01:13:43.569 --> 01:13:48.006
And I could be happy
and stop hoping.

01:13:48.209 --> 01:13:53.283
And l"m telling you this like
you"re interested in my boring life.

01:13:54.249 --> 01:13:57.480
Come to California with me.
l"ve got room.

01:13:57.809 --> 01:13:59.959
I could take all of you.

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:03.844
If you want to change your life,
you can.

01:14:04.049 --> 01:14:06.358
If money"s tight,
it doesn"t matter.

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:09.487
You"ve always been smart.
It"s easy.

01:14:09.849 --> 01:14:12.647
-You want to go to college?
-Yes.

01:14:12.849 --> 01:14:14.282
The state pays.

01:14:14.489 --> 01:14:17.640
The state pays, Bev.

01:14:23.929 --> 01:14:28.559
-Ray won"t go for it.
-lf Ray loves you, he"II do it.

01:14:29.809 --> 01:14:31.367
Right?

01:14:33.249 --> 01:14:38.881
Just do whatever it takes to get
out of here. You don"t belong here.

01:14:40.489 --> 01:14:41.968
You don"t.

01:14:54.769 --> 01:14:58.444
Thank you for saying
the things you said tonight.

01:14:59.249 --> 01:15:01.922
It"s just good to see you smile.

01:15:03.889 --> 01:15:05.481
-Mom!
-Yes!

01:15:05.689 --> 01:15:07.759
I woke up and you were gone!

01:15:07.969 --> 01:15:11.086
She"s not supposed
to leave a kid alone!

01:15:11.289 --> 01:15:14.759
It"s dangerous!
I could have choked!

01:15:17.009 --> 01:15:19.079
l"II talk to Ray.

01:15:21.049 --> 01:15:24.041
Just let me know.
My classes start up.

01:15:24.689 --> 01:15:28.045
Good night, Bev.
Good night, Jason.

01:15:31.369 --> 01:15:34.202
What do you think
about California?

01:15:34.409 --> 01:15:35.842
/ told you to stop it.

01:15:39.049 --> 01:15:41.005
Well, I just....

01:15:47.089 --> 01:15:49.125
Wanna go to California?

01:15:49.329 --> 01:15:52.048
I wanna go if you wanna go.

01:16:00.089 --> 01:16:03.923
-All right. Let"s go to California.
-Yes, Ray!

01:16:04.689 --> 01:16:09.160
-Thank you, Ray! Thank you!
-Yeah.

01:16:10.449 --> 01:16:13.919
Don"t forget to get
baby aspirin for Jason.

01:16:14.129 --> 01:16:16.802
Baby aspirin, okay.

01:16:17.009 --> 01:16:22.606
-l"II finish packing.
-Yeah, baby aspirin.

01:16:22.969 --> 01:16:27.087
-You guys seen Lizzard?

-Hello?
<i>-y</i> ou better get over here. /t <i>'</i> s <i>R</i> ay.

01:16:42.449 --> 01:16:45.009
Okay, up the stairs. Up.

01:16:51.169 --> 01:16:54.161
-Where"s Ray?
-l"m sorry about California.

01:16:55.369 --> 01:16:58.247
-What--?
-He"s downstairs with your father.

01:16:58.449 --> 01:17:00.679
-What"s going on?
-Don"t know.

01:17:00.889 --> 01:17:03.562
Why don"t you sit here?
Come on.

01:17:03.769 --> 01:17:05.327
Get your jacket off.

01:17:05.609 --> 01:17:07.361
-Say it.
-All right.

01:17:07.609 --> 01:17:09.008
Okay.

01:17:14.969 --> 01:17:18.803
-Jason, how"s it going over there?
-Trouble.

01:17:19.369 --> 01:17:22.361
Your husband has come to me
with a problem.

01:17:22.769 --> 01:17:24.805
And he wants my help.

01:17:27.969 --> 01:17:29.482
Raymond?

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:37.839
Hey, Bev, how"s it going?

01:17:39.889 --> 01:17:41.481
Okay.

01:17:42.969 --> 01:17:44.607
I got a....

01:17:46.289 --> 01:17:48.644
I can"t do it without a....

01:17:50.129 --> 01:17:51.960
"Dear Beverly.

01:17:52.569 --> 01:17:55.242
Please don"t go crazy
when you hear this.

01:17:55.569 --> 01:18:01.087
But I regret to inform you
that I am...

01:18:02.049 --> 01:18:03.926
...a junkie.

01:18:04.329 --> 01:18:09.278
I spent all our money on heroin.
I spent everything.

01:18:09.489 --> 01:18:12.128
I even spent the money...

01:18:13.289 --> 01:18:15.883
...for Jason"s aspirin on a fix."

01:18:17.649 --> 01:18:20.083
It was just a tiny fix.

01:18:21.809 --> 01:18:25.768
-But I spent that too.
-Heroin?

01:18:26.769 --> 01:18:30.444
I knew you drank a lot,
but heroin?

01:18:30.809 --> 01:18:33.084
Jesus, Ray!

01:18:35.889 --> 01:18:37.322
For how long?

01:18:38.929 --> 01:18:40.999
-I don"t know.
-No....

01:18:41.849 --> 01:18:45.319
-How long?
-Two years, October 31 .

01:18:46.969 --> 01:18:48.925
Halloween night.

01:18:49.129 --> 01:18:51.802
Remember when Jason
was a monkey?

01:18:52.209 --> 01:18:54.803
-Stop listening!
-You"ve been sick.

01:18:55.009 --> 01:18:59.002
-l"m clearing up.
-I feel so stupid for not knowing!

01:18:59.209 --> 01:19:01.006
Bev, l"m really sorry.

01:19:01.449 --> 01:19:05.727
Shut up. Don"t say sorry.
Sorry doesn"t mean anything.

01:19:06.409 --> 01:19:09.207
-Stop.
-No! This is the last time.

01:19:09.889 --> 01:19:12.687
You"re not helping.
You don"t pay attention!

01:19:12.889 --> 01:19:17.167
Listen. Everything l"m doing
right now is for that boy.

01:19:17.809 --> 01:19:20.607
He needs a father.
This is his father.

01:19:21.049 --> 01:19:24.724
I didn"t pick him.
He"II be sick for a while.

01:19:24.929 --> 01:19:29.127
Your mother and I will take Jason
while you help him. Got it?

01:19:29.329 --> 01:19:33.561
I don"t want your help.
I can take care of my own kid.

01:19:41.409 --> 01:19:45.163
Okay, Ray, I cleaned you a new one.
Okay?

01:19:45.489 --> 01:19:47.127
You feel better?

01:19:48.409 --> 01:19:51.401
You going to throw up again?
Here, Ray.

01:19:51.649 --> 01:19:55.119
Here, Ray. Here.
Oh, no!

01:19:56.849 --> 01:19:59.727
This is so gross.

01:19:59.929 --> 01:20:02.397
Oh, my God!
Please kill me!

01:20:02.649 --> 01:20:06.562
Fine! Stop screaming.
You"re gonna scare Jason.

01:20:06.769 --> 01:20:09.920
Oh, my God. Bev!

01:20:10.129 --> 01:20:13.758
-l"II get more sheets.
-Bev, please! Help me!

01:20:13.969 --> 01:20:16.199
Is Dad okay?

01:20:16.689 --> 01:20:21.319
-What"s your favorite song?
-"Cincinnati Dancing Pig."

01:21:03.249 --> 01:21:05.319
Scoot over.

01:21:07.569 --> 01:21:09.719
I need to rest between rounds.

01:21:13.049 --> 01:21:16.837
Sorry you didn"t get to
go to California.

01:21:17.049 --> 01:21:21.964
Please turn off the pig song!
It"s not helping much.

01:21:24.329 --> 01:21:26.797
Turn off that song!

01:21:35.809 --> 01:21:38.767
-What are you doing?
-Making you breakfast.

01:21:38.969 --> 01:21:40.368
Thank you.

01:21:40.569 --> 01:21:44.448
-Why are you whispering?
-I don"t wanna wake your dad.

01:21:44.689 --> 01:21:47.157
He"s not here.
He left.

01:21:52.649 --> 01:21:55.243
Ray?

01:22:15.129 --> 01:22:16.562
Hey.

01:22:18.689 --> 01:22:21.681
Bev? Let me just....

01:22:22.369 --> 01:22:26.044
Jason"s in his room.
He can hear us.

01:22:26.369 --> 01:22:28.485
All right, Bev. Look....

01:22:28.689 --> 01:22:30.600
Look at me.

01:22:31.889 --> 01:22:33.322
What?

01:22:38.009 --> 01:22:41.001
Don"t say you"re sorry.

01:22:41.889 --> 01:22:43.402
-Just go.
-No!

01:22:43.649 --> 01:22:47.801
I know what you"re thinking.
l"ve got it figured out.

01:22:48.009 --> 01:22:49.840
All right? Look.

01:22:51.649 --> 01:22:54.766
I just can"t <i>q</i> uit, okay?

01:22:54.969 --> 01:22:58.564
You can"t hold it against me
if it"s impossible.

01:22:58.769 --> 01:23:01.886
It"s just who I am.
All right?

01:23:02.089 --> 01:23:07.607
All I need is a little, to keep me
straight. Not enough to get me high.

01:23:07.929 --> 01:23:12.127
Just enough to keep me straight.
Just like this.

01:23:15.809 --> 01:23:18.118
So, what if we keep it at that?

01:23:18.689 --> 01:23:23.080
You want permission to use
a small amount of heroin forever?

01:23:24.969 --> 01:23:26.004
Okay.

01:23:26.369 --> 01:23:28.724
I am gonna get a good job.

01:23:29.089 --> 01:23:31.683
-And, one, look--
-No.

01:23:31.889 --> 01:23:33.163
What?

01:23:35.329 --> 01:23:36.557
No.

01:23:36.929 --> 01:23:39.682
Bev, come on.

01:23:43.009 --> 01:23:45.318
This plan works!

01:23:45.569 --> 01:23:47.002
Ray.

01:23:50.849 --> 01:23:55.127
-You need to think like a grown-up now.
-All right.

01:23:55.929 --> 01:24:01.640
Like a 40-year-old businessman
who takes a train to work every day...

01:24:01.849 --> 01:24:04.727
...and makes responsible decisions.

01:24:05.609 --> 01:24:08.203
-Can you do that?
-Yeah. l"II try.

01:24:08.569 --> 01:24:11.288
You say it"s impossible to <i>q</i> uit.

01:24:11.489 --> 01:24:16.847
I believe you.
I won"t even hold it against you.

01:24:17.089 --> 01:24:20.525
But if you stay
and you ruin our lives...

01:24:20.729 --> 01:24:22.959
...and you know that you will...

01:24:25.409 --> 01:24:27.798
...then it"s my fault.

01:24:31.009 --> 01:24:33.648
Do you want me to live with that?

01:24:40.609 --> 01:24:42.440
No.

01:24:53.129 --> 01:24:54.118
Hey, Dad.

01:24:55.329 --> 01:24:58.958
-Guess what?
-What?

01:24:59.929 --> 01:25:01.806
I lost my tooth.

01:25:03.489 --> 01:25:05.002
See?

01:25:17.729 --> 01:25:19.082
Well.

01:25:21.249 --> 01:25:24.958
-I just came in to say good night.
-Good night, Dad.

01:25:31.489 --> 01:25:34.879
-I love your guts, buddy.
-I love you.

01:25:35.649 --> 01:25:38.447
Dad, are you going somewhere?

01:25:43.689 --> 01:25:45.407
Can I come?

01:25:47.649 --> 01:25:49.207
Why can"t I come?

01:25:49.849 --> 01:25:51.726
Because your mom...

01:25:51.969 --> 01:25:57.248
...doesn"t think it"s a good idea
if we"re around each other any more.

01:25:57.809 --> 01:25:59.845
l"m not supposed to say that.

01:26:09.729 --> 01:26:12.687
You"re gonna hear
a lot of bad things about me.

01:26:13.409 --> 01:26:15.001
Okay?

01:26:15.329 --> 01:26:19.447
But only two out of the three things
are gonna be right.

01:26:19.649 --> 01:26:25.485
So when you hear something
that"s really, really bad...

01:26:25.889 --> 01:26:31.247
...you try to think that"s
the one time they"re wrong, okay?

01:26:32.129 --> 01:26:34.120
Okay.

01:26:35.329 --> 01:26:36.887
All right?

01:26:37.089 --> 01:26:40.877
-I love you, Dad.
-I love you too.

01:26:41.089 --> 01:26:42.920
All right, buddy?

01:26:45.609 --> 01:26:46.962
Okay, I gotta go.

01:26:51.329 --> 01:26:52.808
I gotta go!

01:26:53.489 --> 01:26:56.879
Dad! Wait!

01:26:57.089 --> 01:26:58.761
Dad, wait!

01:26:58.969 --> 01:27:01.244
Dad, wait!

01:27:01.889 --> 01:27:04.767
Jason, what are you doing?

01:27:06.449 --> 01:27:08.724
Jason, you cannot go with him!

01:27:08.929 --> 01:27:10.965
Dad, wait!

01:27:11.169 --> 01:27:15.082
Dad! I wanna go with you!

01:27:15.289 --> 01:27:19.202
-Jason?!
-Wait! Dad!

01:27:19.409 --> 01:27:22.481
-Jason.
-Take me with you!

01:27:22.929 --> 01:27:27.605
You"re mad, but we wouldn"t
have had a chance unless I did this.

01:27:28.289 --> 01:27:30.678
Leave me alone.

01:27:33.049 --> 01:27:36.359
Leave me alone!

01:27:37.249 --> 01:27:40.924
If you get out of the street,
l"II leave you alone.

01:27:46.969 --> 01:27:51.406
But remember,
I am your mother.

01:27:53.609 --> 01:27:56.965
That means you"re not allowed
to stay mad at me!

01:28:08.769 --> 01:28:11.124
-Can I get two coffees, black?
-Sure.

01:28:11.329 --> 01:28:14.480
-Where"s the bathroom?
-Two coffees, to go.

01:28:19.929 --> 01:28:21.726
-Hello?
-Amelia.

01:28:22.209 --> 01:28:27.237
Jason. l"m so glad it"s you.
Have you seen your father?

01:28:27.609 --> 01:28:31.727
-No, we"re not there yet. l--
-/ got your message.

01:28:31.929 --> 01:28:34.921
-You did?
-Yeah.

01:28:35.649 --> 01:28:37.162
I love you too.

01:28:37.849 --> 01:28:42.127
This is the greatest conversation
of my life!

01:28:42.329 --> 01:28:45.366
This is the greatest conversation
of my life.

01:28:46.369 --> 01:28:47.768
Okay.

01:28:47.969 --> 01:28:52.281
So, l"m all packed.
l"ve almost got you all packed.

01:28:52.609 --> 01:28:55.407
And we"re leaving tonight.

01:28:57.609 --> 01:29:00.885
-How did your mom take it?
-There was a discussion.

01:29:01.089 --> 01:29:04.604
And she had some <i>q</i> uestions.

01:29:04.929 --> 01:29:07.079
But / think...

01:29:07.289 --> 01:29:10.964
...I figured a way for it
to be okay with everyone.

01:29:11.169 --> 01:29:13.729
-You did?
-You transfer here.

01:29:15.769 --> 01:29:20.285
-What are you talking about?
-I don"t know. l"m just....

01:29:20.649 --> 01:29:23.083
-Jase <i>!</i>
-l"m screwing us up.

01:29:24.129 --> 01:29:27.246
No. No.

01:29:27.809 --> 01:29:32.678
You are not allowed
to feel bad about us. Okay?

01:29:33.089 --> 01:29:37.480
Listen to me. I am not
another woman you have to handle.

01:29:39.049 --> 01:29:43.725
/f you don <i>'</i> t go <i>w</i> ith me, <i>w</i> e <i>'</i> ll
see each other every chance <i>w</i> e get.

01:29:43.929 --> 01:29:46.807
-You are amazing.
-No, l"m not.

01:29:47.009 --> 01:29:49.648
<i>-y</i> ou are.
-l"m not.

01:29:49.849 --> 01:29:51.487
l"m f urious at her!

01:29:54.569 --> 01:29:56.082
But...

01:29:58.689 --> 01:30:01.044
...I can"t give up on you.

01:30:01.409 --> 01:30:06.927
Someday you"II stop raising her.
You"ve been doing it your whole life.

01:30:07.809 --> 01:30:13.042
You"re young. You deserve to be young.
We deserve to be young together.

01:30:13.289 --> 01:30:16.565
<i>R</i> ight no <i>w</i>,
/ can <i>'</i> t make you happy, so...

01:30:17.409 --> 01:30:19.923
-...I gotta go.
-Amelia, wait.

01:30:20.249 --> 01:30:22.968
l"II call you when my flight gets in.

01:30:23.969 --> 01:30:25.846
I love you so much.

01:30:35.489 --> 01:30:37.081
Sorry.

01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:46.645
Jason, are you coming?

01:31:00.889 --> 01:31:03.926
Do my grocery shopping,
and l"II pay you.

01:31:11.329 --> 01:31:15.607
-Every station"s in color.
-Who"d you steal it f rom?

01:31:15.809 --> 01:31:17.242
I bought it.

01:31:19.809 --> 01:31:23.643
I was wondering
if we could be alone for a minute.

01:31:24.609 --> 01:31:28.079
Alone is an unknown dimension to me.
Talk.

01:31:28.289 --> 01:31:32.168
I know l"m not
your favorite person in the world.

01:31:33.769 --> 01:31:37.159
But l"d like to help.
Ray was a good f riend.

01:31:37.369 --> 01:31:41.920
l"d like to offer you a job.
$200 an hour to use your stove.

01:31:42.169 --> 01:31:44.729
Goodbye, Lizzard.
Take the TV.

01:31:44.929 --> 01:31:48.205
No. It"s a gift for me.
Isn"t it?

01:31:48.449 --> 01:31:50.440
Yes, it is.

01:31:51.329 --> 01:31:53.285
It"s a gift. For him.

01:31:53.489 --> 01:31:57.402
-We need to have a family talk.
-It"s not your fault.

01:31:58.089 --> 01:32:00.683
You handle a kid by
taking things away.

01:32:00.889 --> 01:32:06.088
But he doesn"t have anything
to take away. Now he does.

01:32:06.569 --> 01:32:08.366
l"II just wait here.

01:32:08.569 --> 01:32:10.764
It"s not fair, Ma!

01:32:11.169 --> 01:32:13.808
l"m the only kid
without a color TV.

01:32:14.009 --> 01:32:17.968
Well, l"m the only mother
who wears ripped pantyhose.

01:32:18.209 --> 01:32:22.168
l"m the only kid I know
who wears ripped socks!

01:32:23.129 --> 01:32:26.166
l"m the only mother
whose shoes talk to people!

01:32:26.369 --> 01:32:28.200
And I do everything here!

01:32:28.409 --> 01:32:31.924
I have to shop, cook, clean
and do the laundry!

01:32:32.129 --> 01:32:34.324
I never get to play!

01:32:34.569 --> 01:32:37.845
Yeah? Neither do I!
I go to night school.

01:32:38.129 --> 01:32:43.567
When you work a double shift, I use
the spare time to sleep and bathe.

01:32:43.769 --> 01:32:46.078
-We"re a team, right?
-No!

01:32:46.289 --> 01:32:50.726
You"re supposed to be the mother!
l"m supposed to be the kid!

01:32:59.009 --> 01:33:00.408
Yeah.

01:33:03.649 --> 01:33:07.437
-Let us in! Amelia"s f reezing!
-l"m not cold.

01:33:14.449 --> 01:33:16.724
My father wrote me again.

01:33:16.929 --> 01:33:19.602
He put in another picture
of his wife.

01:33:20.129 --> 01:33:23.326
He wants me
to call her Mother Monsoon.

01:33:23.969 --> 01:33:29.407
I wrote back saying, "She"s not my
mother. Only my mother"s my mother."

01:33:30.329 --> 01:33:33.048
I hate him.

01:33:36.649 --> 01:33:38.765
Come on, Amelia.
Don"t cry.

01:33:39.209 --> 01:33:41.359
At least your father writes.

01:33:41.609 --> 01:33:45.284
He thinks about you.
l"II tell you this much.

01:33:45.489 --> 01:33:49.482
Wherever my dad is,
l"d rather be there than out here.

01:33:53.569 --> 01:33:55.161
We"ve got to focus.

01:33:55.369 --> 01:33:58.202
This will get all of us out of here.

01:33:58.409 --> 01:34:02.004
And I won"t have to ask
my parents for money. Okay?

01:34:02.849 --> 01:34:06.808
When we move to New York,
l"II find the richest guy.

01:34:07.609 --> 01:34:10.442
We"II live in a penthouse.

01:34:12.129 --> 01:34:17.203
You"II be a famous author,
and we"II have book-signing parties.

01:34:19.169 --> 01:34:22.764
-Hey.
-Hey, Grandpa.

01:34:22.969 --> 01:34:27.724
Your grandma wanted me to bring this.
You need it. Give me a kiss.

01:34:28.449 --> 01:34:30.326
You"re so big.

01:34:30.569 --> 01:34:33.606
Your mom care you"re throwing snow
at the house?

01:34:34.009 --> 01:34:38.400
Our mothers went to the store.
They won"t be back for a long time.

01:34:38.849 --> 01:34:40.362
Is that so?

01:34:41.969 --> 01:34:43.880
Don"t break any windows.

01:34:44.089 --> 01:34:48.287
It"s your turn to pick a night
to stay over, huh? Button up.

01:34:51.929 --> 01:34:53.806
Grandpa?

01:34:58.209 --> 01:35:00.723
Mom"s inside drying weed.

01:35:04.289 --> 01:35:08.646
Oh, boy.
These kids got small voices, huh?

01:35:08.849 --> 01:35:13.445
-What do you think of that?
-I didn"t hear a thing. Let"s go.

01:35:14.969 --> 01:35:16.687
Leo, come on.

01:35:25.089 --> 01:35:28.126
Hasek. You made bail.

01:35:32.409 --> 01:35:35.481
The kid"s out,
they"re in business in a day.

01:35:36.609 --> 01:35:42.320
Go to Main Street. You know the old
brick building? He"s chopping cars.

01:35:45.729 --> 01:35:48.527
-Can you fix this?
-Sure.

01:35:48.729 --> 01:35:50.162
How did they know?

01:35:50.369 --> 01:35:52.564
I won"t ever tell you told.

01:35:52.769 --> 01:35:57.240
If there"s anyone in the world
you can trust, it"s me.

01:35:57.569 --> 01:35:59.127
-Thanks.
-You"re welcome.

01:36:02.969 --> 01:36:08.566
They took it all. All the money
I was saving to get to New York. Gone.

01:36:10.449 --> 01:36:14.158
They didn"t take it.
I used it to bail you out.

01:36:14.369 --> 01:36:17.884
Why didn"t you borrow it
f rom your parents?

01:36:18.209 --> 01:36:23.442
My parents wouldn"t bail me out!
Did you want me to leave you there?

01:36:23.809 --> 01:36:27.882
-No. Who bailed you out?
-Dennis.

01:36:29.689 --> 01:36:34.160
-I thought he wasn"t talking to you.
-Yeah, well...

01:36:34.369 --> 01:36:38.999
...he rode into town on his big
white horse to save the family name.

01:36:40.769 --> 01:36:42.885
But I had to make him a deal.

01:36:43.609 --> 01:36:44.928
What kind of deal?

01:36:45.249 --> 01:36:47.809
Since my parents
are kicking me out...

01:36:48.049 --> 01:36:51.758
...he wants to bring me and Amelia
to Arizona with him.

01:36:51.969 --> 01:36:57.487
He said he"II cover my rent
and food and anything I want.

01:36:57.729 --> 01:37:01.404
-lf I don"t....
-lf you don"t what?

01:37:03.329 --> 01:37:05.445
If I don"t see you anymore.

01:37:07.289 --> 01:37:10.804
But l"m gonna tell him
no way tomorrow.

01:37:11.009 --> 01:37:12.203
l"II....

01:37:37.569 --> 01:37:40.037
They like to hug a lot.

01:37:41.889 --> 01:37:44.039
They"II never keep us apart.

01:37:49.689 --> 01:37:52.283
l"II call you as soon as I get there.

01:37:53.089 --> 01:37:54.681
I love you.

01:37:57.209 --> 01:37:59.803
Come on, Amelia.
We got to go now.

01:38:03.329 --> 01:38:04.648
Bye.

01:38:06.169 --> 01:38:08.205
Bye, Jason.

01:38:12.889 --> 01:38:14.641
Jason, get in the car.

01:38:15.169 --> 01:38:17.683
-Would you go, Dennis?
-All right.

01:38:19.249 --> 01:38:21.604
Dennis, drive caref ully.

01:38:33.689 --> 01:38:38.763
If I told you something important,
you promise not to get mad?

01:38:39.169 --> 01:38:41.046
Tell me. What?

01:38:42.209 --> 01:38:46.441
You got to swear not to get mad,
or else l"m not going to tell you.

01:38:46.689 --> 01:38:48.566
Fine. I swear.

01:38:50.689 --> 01:38:52.725
I told Grandpa.

01:38:53.169 --> 01:38:55.603
You told Grandpa what?

01:38:55.969 --> 01:38:59.041
I told him you were inside
drying weed.

01:39:00.129 --> 01:39:01.847
You what?

01:39:14.969 --> 01:39:18.848
-Why would you do that? Why?
-I don"t know.

01:39:20.129 --> 01:39:25.123
You don"t destroy everybody"s life
and then say, "I don"t know." Why?

01:39:25.569 --> 01:39:29.482
I was gonna use that money
to get us out of here.

01:39:29.729 --> 01:39:33.483
Do you understand?
You just ruined our lives!

01:39:33.769 --> 01:39:38.081
That"s not what you say
when someone tells the truth.

01:39:39.009 --> 01:39:44.083
And the worst thing of all is
Fay is gone. Because of you.

01:39:46.969 --> 01:39:48.960
I have no one.

01:39:56.729 --> 01:39:58.367
Some things never change.

01:39:58.609 --> 01:40:03.319
Like me being confused about
everything e <i>x</i> cept <i>w</i> hat she <i>'</i> s feeling.

01:40:03.569 --> 01:40:05.127
We must be getting close.

01:40:05.329 --> 01:40:07.206
This is where he lives.

01:40:07.409 --> 01:40:11.607
She <i>w</i> on <i>'</i> t admit it,
but she <i>'</i> s scared about seeing <i>R</i> ay.

01:40:25.169 --> 01:40:28.002
Are you sure you"II be okay
seeing him?

01:40:28.889 --> 01:40:30.242
Sure.

01:40:30.449 --> 01:40:35.204
You can wait in the car if you want.
I completely understand.

01:40:35.409 --> 01:40:36.842
l"m fine.

01:40:50.009 --> 01:40:53.479
Coming! Just a second!

01:40:54.849 --> 01:40:57.682
l"II get my robe on!

01:41:06.209 --> 01:41:09.804
-Does Raymond Hasek live here?
-And you are?

01:41:10.649 --> 01:41:12.207
Beverly.

01:41:15.209 --> 01:41:20.124
-It"s for you. Get up!
-Hold on, l"m coming.

01:41:20.329 --> 01:41:24.447
Come on in. He"s indisposed.
You might as well come in.

01:41:25.209 --> 01:41:26.881
Thank you.

01:41:29.049 --> 01:41:32.041
Sorry, we weren"t expecting company.

01:41:32.249 --> 01:41:35.241
-You"ve got cool stuff.
-I collect things.

01:41:38.129 --> 01:41:39.926
Is it hunting season?

01:41:40.569 --> 01:41:45.165
That"s the firing range.
You into that?

01:41:45.649 --> 01:41:48.209
Some people....
Ray!

01:41:48.729 --> 01:41:50.287
Just a sec.

01:41:56.689 --> 01:41:58.805
Ray, it"s me.

01:42:01.329 --> 01:42:02.921
Beverly.

01:42:05.409 --> 01:42:07.365
Bev! Hey!

01:42:08.369 --> 01:42:10.724
Hey, Bev. It"s me, Ray.

01:42:14.849 --> 01:42:17.807
I never thought of you as being older.

01:42:25.249 --> 01:42:27.319
Beverly, this is Shirley.

01:42:27.969 --> 01:42:30.403
Shirley, this is my first wife.

01:42:31.449 --> 01:42:32.564
Hello.

01:42:33.689 --> 01:42:35.407
Charmed.

01:42:37.009 --> 01:42:38.442
Hey, man.

01:42:38.929 --> 01:42:41.762
Ray, this is your son, Jason.

01:42:52.369 --> 01:42:54.837
I wouldn"t have known you.

01:43:03.049 --> 01:43:04.687
Hey, thanks.

01:43:07.489 --> 01:43:10.083
Hey, you wanna sit down?
Come on.

01:43:10.449 --> 01:43:14.681
Clear off the thing.
Have a seat.

01:43:17.169 --> 01:43:20.320
Right there is good.
Something to drink?

01:43:20.569 --> 01:43:23.402
-Something to drink?
-We don"t have anything.

01:43:23.609 --> 01:43:26.407
Get them an orange thing.

01:43:27.009 --> 01:43:28.920
A moment alone, Ray?

01:43:29.409 --> 01:43:31.365
-Kool-Aid?
-You want to--

01:43:31.609 --> 01:43:36.046
-l"m not going anywhere.
-Yeah. Thanks.

01:43:37.089 --> 01:43:39.239
Right.

01:43:41.609 --> 01:43:43.201
Let me lay this out.

01:43:43.409 --> 01:43:48.802
l"ve been making my living working
at a small newspaper in New York.

01:43:49.009 --> 01:43:51.967
But at night, for 6 years...

01:43:53.089 --> 01:43:56.638
-...l"ve been writing a book.
-Four years.

01:43:56.849 --> 01:43:59.602
You started the book
when I turned 16.

01:44:00.009 --> 01:44:03.684
It was my birthday present.
That was four years ago.

01:44:04.049 --> 01:44:08.964
-Fine, four years. Happy?
-Just give it to him right.

01:44:13.009 --> 01:44:15.364
Kool-Aid.

01:44:15.849 --> 01:44:17.202
Enjoy.

01:44:18.689 --> 01:44:22.921
-I finished the book.
-Really? That"s great.

01:44:23.969 --> 01:44:26.324
And they want to publish it.

01:44:27.889 --> 01:44:30.847
You know this is huge for me.

01:44:31.049 --> 01:44:35.008
It"s what l"ve wanted
for as long as I can remember.

01:44:39.089 --> 01:44:41.808
But it"s a small publishing house.

01:44:43.089 --> 01:44:48.561
Since you"re in so much of it,
they wanna be caref ul about lawsuits.

01:44:48.769 --> 01:44:53.923
There"s a lot about you and drugs and
illegal acts. It"s not flattering.

01:44:54.129 --> 01:44:56.199
Anyway...

01:44:57.489 --> 01:44:59.844
...what l"m getting at is...

01:45:00.969 --> 01:45:04.041
...they need you
to sign this release...

01:45:04.369 --> 01:45:07.202
...or they can"t risk publishing it.

01:45:10.649 --> 01:45:12.128
I get it.

01:45:13.889 --> 01:45:15.686
Ex cuse me.

01:45:15.889 --> 01:45:20.440
Ex cuse me, Ray.
Honey, stop.

01:45:20.849 --> 01:45:23.568
-Give me that.
-She has to pay you.

01:45:23.769 --> 01:45:29.685
-You"re in her book. She"II get rich.
-What are you talking about?

01:45:30.289 --> 01:45:33.281
-l"m asking how much we get.
-I don"t--

01:45:33.489 --> 01:45:36.083
-Why are you starting?
-$100, 000.

01:45:36.449 --> 01:45:37.848
What?!

01:45:39.969 --> 01:45:43.803
-Did I ever ask for child support?
-Get out.

01:45:44.329 --> 01:45:48.766
-Hey, come on.
-Come back when you got money.

01:45:48.969 --> 01:45:50.880
-Calm down.
-l"m not leaving.

01:45:51.089 --> 01:45:54.001
-Just get up.
-We can"t leave.

01:45:54.209 --> 01:45:57.724
l"m the one busting my ass
to get us out of here!

01:45:57.929 --> 01:46:00.568
If you think about moving,
l"m gone.

01:46:01.169 --> 01:46:05.560
-I will never forgive you!
-We"II get over it, trust me.

01:46:06.409 --> 01:46:10.402
We should"ve given you more time
to talk. l"m sorry.

01:46:10.649 --> 01:46:12.640
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

01:46:13.329 --> 01:46:17.288
-What are you doing?
-You were gonna sign your life away.

01:46:17.489 --> 01:46:21.118
What were you thinking?
God, I can"t stand her!

01:46:23.209 --> 01:46:25.279
-Give me the keys.
-No.

01:46:25.489 --> 01:46:30.279
You don"t care. l"m not getting
published, and you don"t even care.

01:46:32.129 --> 01:46:36.247
I just saw a guy
who hasn"t showered in a month.

01:46:36.449 --> 01:46:40.442
Whose teeth are rotting,
who"s living in shit.

01:46:40.849 --> 01:46:43.568
-And he"s my dad.
-Don"t do this.

01:46:43.889 --> 01:46:46.767
Don"t turn this into your problem.

01:46:47.569 --> 01:46:53.121
Do me a favor. Just pretend
to be a good mother for two minutes.

01:46:53.329 --> 01:46:57.242
Just two minutes
out of your whole life.

01:46:57.449 --> 01:46:59.326
Okay?

01:47:06.769 --> 01:47:08.646
Where are you going?

01:47:08.849 --> 01:47:14.082
You"II have to remember what you
just said as long as you live.

01:47:14.289 --> 01:47:17.122
-l"m not coming after you!
-Good.

01:47:17.329 --> 01:47:19.126
She hasn"t changed.

01:47:20.649 --> 01:47:24.403
Everything always happens to her,
no one else.

01:47:24.649 --> 01:47:26.401
Hey, come here.

01:47:30.609 --> 01:47:31.803
Come here.

01:47:38.689 --> 01:47:40.884
I signed that thing, okay?

01:47:43.809 --> 01:47:48.246
I can"t give it to you,
she"s watching. Don"t look.

01:47:48.689 --> 01:47:53.638
I said I came out to take out the
garbage and say goodbye.

01:47:53.849 --> 01:47:56.079
-Right, right, right.
-So....

01:47:57.049 --> 01:48:01.998
Wow, this is probably the last time
l"II ever talk to you.

01:48:02.689 --> 01:48:05.999
I just want to say that....

01:48:06.209 --> 01:48:10.600
I used to feel real bad
about leaving you and all.

01:48:11.569 --> 01:48:16.359
Then, a couple of years ago,
your ma sent me a letter, saying...

01:48:18.449 --> 01:48:20.485
...what a nice kid you were.

01:48:20.849 --> 01:48:24.478
What a good man
you turned out to be.

01:48:25.729 --> 01:48:28.926
l"d like to think
I had a lot to do with that.

01:48:29.889 --> 01:48:34.883
-Yeah, okay.
-Even if all I did was stay away...

01:48:35.409 --> 01:48:38.719
...it"s still the best thing
I ever did in my life.

01:48:44.449 --> 01:48:48.362
I can"t give you the paper.
She"s watching us like a hawk.

01:48:48.889 --> 01:48:51.357
Don"t look, don"t look, don"t look.

01:48:52.249 --> 01:48:57.243
So l"m gonna come in
like l"m hugging you.

01:48:57.449 --> 01:48:59.758
l"II slip it in your pocket.

01:48:59.969 --> 01:49:04.087
l"m gonna come in now.
Lift up your arm.

01:49:06.609 --> 01:49:09.248
-It"s in.
-All right.

01:49:13.209 --> 01:49:16.406
-Finished throwing out the garbage?
-Yeah.

01:49:17.809 --> 01:49:21.119
-You sure about this?
-What, Shirley?

01:49:21.329 --> 01:49:24.799
She"II get over it.
Women want to forgive.

01:49:26.169 --> 01:49:30.447
Even a total screw-up, they"II help.
It"s in their nature.

01:49:31.649 --> 01:49:36.677
You just gotta remember, you gotta
tell them you need their help.

01:49:36.889 --> 01:49:39.084
Or else they won"t do it.

01:49:40.249 --> 01:49:44.037
Lord knows, I need
all the help I can get.

01:49:46.009 --> 01:49:48.000
Don"t we all?

01:49:52.409 --> 01:49:54.718
Goodbye, son.

01:50:29.489 --> 01:50:33.641
I was a good mother.
No, I was a great mother...

01:50:33.849 --> 01:50:37.285
...for what I went through
to keep you together.

01:50:37.489 --> 01:50:42.483
l"m not asking for thanks,
but don"t do this to me, you ingrate.

01:50:44.209 --> 01:50:46.245
Who says l"m in one piece?

01:50:47.129 --> 01:50:51.008
-You"re the most normal person I know.
-Normal?

01:50:53.049 --> 01:50:54.482
Normal?

01:50:54.729 --> 01:50:59.723
Amelia was in New York two weeks ago.
She wants me to transfer.

01:50:59.929 --> 01:51:03.399
She wants me to enroll in her school.

01:51:03.609 --> 01:51:05.998
But I can"t go.

01:51:06.889 --> 01:51:12.122
I can"t leave you.
If something bad happens to you...

01:51:12.369 --> 01:51:14.644
...it"s my fault.

01:51:17.289 --> 01:51:22.921
l"m what went wrong with your life.
You know, you wrote a book about it.

01:51:26.489 --> 01:51:28.844
I swore I wouldn"t--

01:51:29.689 --> 01:51:34.717
Did you know I love Amelia?
Don"t worry, she left already.

01:51:35.249 --> 01:51:37.285
Here"s the f unny thing.

01:51:37.489 --> 01:51:41.607
She thinks I can"t love her
because she can"t make me happy...

01:51:41.809 --> 01:51:45.484
...and damn it, she"s the only
good thing in my life.

01:51:48.849 --> 01:51:51.568
l"m just incredibly screwed up.

01:51:51.769 --> 01:51:55.398
Just so we"re real clear about this,
I blame you.

01:52:01.089 --> 01:52:03.887
When does this job ever end?

01:52:06.089 --> 01:52:08.045
You call it a job?

01:52:08.249 --> 01:52:11.207
Well, what do you think it is?
A calling?

01:52:18.849 --> 01:52:20.885
I screwed up.

01:52:23.649 --> 01:52:25.685
I screwed up.

01:52:26.249 --> 01:52:29.400
Come on, don"t cry.
l"m sorry.

01:52:30.849 --> 01:52:34.762
l"m sorry.
Look, Ray signed.

01:52:36.769 --> 01:52:40.967
I don"t care. Just go.

01:52:41.169 --> 01:52:43.205
Just leave me here.

01:52:50.969 --> 01:52:53.358
Mom...

01:52:53.929 --> 01:52:56.284
...I need your help.

01:53:01.049 --> 01:53:03.199
With what?

01:53:15.409 --> 01:53:19.561
Mom, wait.
