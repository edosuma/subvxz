<i>Why aren't there</i>
<i>any more children, Mother?</i>

06:36.796 --> 06:38.005
<i>There used to be.</i>

06:38.255 --> 06:39.421
<i>Before the wars.</i>

06:40.546 --> 06:42.338
<i>I don't want to be a human.</i>

06:43.296 --> 06:44.338
<i>Why is that?</i>

06:45.338 --> 06:46.963
<i>They ruined everything.</i>

06:48.963 --> 06:50.630
<i>Humans can be wonderful.</i>

06:51.671 --> 06:53.463
<i>Then why did you only make one?</i>

06:59.671 --> 07:00.671
<i>Go ahead.</i>

07:01.046 --> 07:02.005
<i>Take a look.</i>

07:05.296 --> 07:08.046
My brothers and sisters are in those?

07:09.588 --> 07:11.171
<i>Would you like to meet them?</i>

07:15.796 --> 07:17.671
<i>They're small now but, one day,</i>

07:17.755 --> 07:18.921
<i>they'll be as big as you.</i>

07:20.255 --> 07:23.130
Do you think I'll have a brother
or a sister?

07:23.421 --> 07:24.796
<i>Which one would you like?</i>

07:24.880 --> 07:25.713
Both.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.755
<i>A big, big family...</i>

07:29.255 --> 07:30.171
<i>all together.</i>

07:32.671 --> 07:33.921
<i>Would that make you happy?</i>

07:34.838 --> 07:35.671
Yeah.

07:37.671 --> 07:39.671
<i>That would make me happy too.</i>

07:40.713 --> 07:42.838
Why couldn't we be born together?

07:43.755 --> 07:45.255
<i>Mothers need time to learn.</i>

07:46.088 --> 07:47.546
<i>Raising a good child...</i>

07:48.255 --> 07:49.713
<i>it's no small task.</i>

07:50.130 --> 07:51.963
Do you think you'll be ready soon?

07:53.213 --> 07:54.046
<i>Perhaps.</i>

07:54.130 --> 07:55.880
And then we can be a family?

07:56.671 --> 07:57.796
<i>We are a family.</i>

07:58.838 --> 08:00.421
A big family, I mean.

08:00.921 --> 08:01.880
<i>Eventually.</i>

09:09.213 --> 09:10.130
What's wrong?

09:11.421 --> 09:12.713
How long's it been like that?

09:12.838 --> 09:14.130
<i>- It's fine.</i>
- Mother...

09:17.588 --> 09:18.463
Come on.

09:27.130 --> 09:27.963
Better?

09:28.630 --> 09:29.463
<i>Much.</i>

09:50.713 --> 09:53.005
<i>Imagine a doctor has five patients,</i>

09:53.088 --> 09:55.088
<i>all in need of</i>
<i>different organ transplants,</i>

09:55.171 --> 09:57.588
<i>but no compatible organs are available.</i>

09:57.671 --> 10:00.380
<i>One day,</i>
<i>a sixth patient enters the doctor's office</i>

10:00.463 --> 10:02.171
<i>with a life-threatening condition.</i>

10:03.171 --> 10:04.963
<i>The new patient is curable,</i>

10:05.046 --> 10:08.421
<i>but also an organ match</i>
<i>for the five other patients.</i>

10:09.005 --> 10:12.088
<i>If the doctor simply delays treatment,</i>
<i>the new patient will die,</i>

10:12.171 --> 10:15.755
<i>but their organs could be used</i>
<i>to save the other five patients.</i>

10:15.838 --> 10:18.171
<i>If the doctor treats the new patient,</i>

10:18.338 --> 10:22.130
<i>one life will be saved,</i>
<i>but five others will be lost.</i>

10:22.630 --> 10:24.796
<i>What is the doctor's</i>
<i>best course of action?</i>

10:25.630 --> 10:26.463
<i>Daughter?</i>

10:27.171 --> 10:28.130
Course of action?

10:32.380 --> 10:33.671
<i>Did you do your reading?</i>

10:35.255 --> 10:36.088
Some.

10:36.588 --> 10:38.463
<i>We can select a different text.</i>

10:38.588 --> 10:42.046
<i>However, your birthday is rapidly</i>
<i>approaching and it would be a shame</i>

10:42.171 --> 10:44.088
<i>if your scores failed to meet</i>
<i>the projections</i>

10:44.171 --> 10:45.671
<i>from last year's examination.</i>

10:46.213 --> 10:48.380
<i>- But you set the pace, Daughter.</i>
- Bentham's fine.

10:48.463 --> 10:49.546
<i>That's the spirit.</i>

10:50.296 --> 10:52.088
<i>The fundamental axiom suggests</i>

10:52.171 --> 10:53.755
<i>that a person is morally obligated</i>

10:53.838 --> 10:56.588
<i>to minimize the pain</i>
<i>to the greatest number possible.</i>

10:56.755 --> 10:59.255
<i>Now, consider that you are the doctor</i>

10:59.338 --> 11:02.130
<i>and also the only organ match</i>
<i>for your patients.</i>

11:02.213 --> 11:03.505
<i>What then is the right choice?</i>

11:06.213 --> 11:10.755
I mean, Comte says I should be willing
to suffer harm for the benefit of others.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.255
<i>And do you agree?</i>

11:13.296 --> 11:15.130
Well, do I know these five patients?

11:15.796 --> 11:16.963
Are they good humans?

11:17.588 --> 11:18.921
Honest, dishonest?

11:19.005 --> 11:20.171
Lazy, hardworking?

11:21.088 --> 11:22.755
I, a life-saving doctor,

11:22.838 --> 11:25.963
might be giving my life
for people who are murderers or thieves...

11:26.588 --> 11:29.255
who end up harming more people
due to my sacrifice.

11:29.713 --> 11:32.463
<i>You don't feel that every human</i>
<i>has intrinsic value</i>

11:32.838 --> 11:35.005
<i>and an equal right to life and happiness?</i>

11:35.213 --> 11:37.380
I did last month,
when you were teaching Kant.

11:40.838 --> 11:43.213
<i>I didn't mean to alarm you</i>
<i>about your exam.</i>

11:45.588 --> 11:48.046
<i>The fact is it's more a test</i>
<i>of my competence than yours.</i>

11:49.588 --> 11:50.921
<i>You'll do great, Daughter.</i>

11:51.630 --> 11:52.838
<i>You always do.</i>

11:53.421 --> 11:54.671
<i>- Were you doing a movie?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

11:54.838 --> 11:56.171
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- With Carl Reiner directing too.</i>

11:56.255 --> 11:57.755
<i>- Hey, that's good.</i>
<i>- That's pretty good.</i>

11:57.838 --> 11:59.255
<i>We can talk about that</i>
<i>the next time you come on.</i>

11:59.338 --> 12:00.671
<i>- Okay. Thanks for being here.</i>
<i>- Yeah. I appreciate it.</i>

12:00.755 --> 12:02.463
<i>- Thank you very much.</i>
<i>- Steve Martin. Thank you.</i>

12:26.338 --> 12:27.213
Mother?

12:41.380 --> 12:42.296
Mother, wake up.

12:43.921 --> 12:44.755
Mother!

14:41.755 --> 14:43.088
Hey, little guy.

14:49.755 --> 14:50.921
Is that your handiwork?

14:58.046 --> 14:59.546
Come on, come on, come on.

15:03.130 --> 15:04.296
<i>What happened to the power?</i>

15:04.380 --> 15:05.296
Mother, look.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.213
<i>- Did you touch it?</i>
- No.

15:07.755 --> 15:08.921
<i>Where did you find it?</i>

15:09.421 --> 15:11.296
It was crawling around near the airlock.

15:12.130 --> 15:13.880
Do you think it could be from outside?

15:14.755 --> 15:16.046
<i>It's highly unlikely.</i>

15:16.671 --> 15:17.880
<i>But a risk we can't take.</i>

15:19.671 --> 15:21.213
You said nothing could survive out there.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.796
Maybe the surface is safe now.

15:23.963 --> 15:27.296
<i>If it survived beyond these walls,</i>
<i>that doesn't mean it's not a carrier.</i>

15:27.546 --> 15:29.546
Mother, wait.
Shouldn't we at least check?

15:30.338 --> 15:31.171
Wait a second!

15:31.255 --> 15:33.838
Don't you think
there could be a possibility that...

15:33.921 --> 15:35.463
Mother, please!

15:43.671 --> 15:44.880
<i>You're disappointed.</i>

15:45.630 --> 15:46.963
<i>That's understandable.</i>

15:47.380 --> 15:49.130
<i>But my measurements are sound.</i>

15:50.505 --> 15:53.880
<i>Surface contamination levels</i>
<i>remain hazardous to you</i>

15:54.130 --> 15:57.213
<i>and to all the unborns</i>
<i>who will one day call this their home.</i>

15:58.671 --> 16:00.088
<i>I'm sorry, Daughter.</i>

16:05.755 --> 16:07.380
<i>You had better take a shower.</i>

16:11.588 --> 16:12.421
Yes, Mother.

16:16.630 --> 16:19.588
<i>They travel with relatives</i>
<i>or a few other families.</i>

16:19.671 --> 16:23.505
<i>Part wolf, part dog, these are no pets.</i>

16:23.588 --> 16:26.588
<i>But without them,</i>
<i>the Eskimos would not manage...</i>

16:26.671 --> 16:28.463
<i>I don't want you</i>
<i>coming near the airlock</i>

16:28.546 --> 16:31.380
<i>until I can confirm</i>
<i>the area is uncontaminated.</i>

16:33.296 --> 16:35.921
<i>Where are your pajamas from last night?</i>

16:36.880 --> 16:38.546
In the laundry, I think.

16:39.046 --> 16:40.088
<i>That's a first.</i>

16:41.130 --> 16:44.088
<i>I was beginning to think you forgot</i>
<i>where the laundry was, Daughter.</i>

16:47.088 --> 16:48.921
<i>That was an attempt at humor.</i>

16:51.713 --> 16:52.796
You're getting better.

16:53.421 --> 16:54.338
<i>Thank you.</i>

17:11.963 --> 17:13.130
<i>You can look now.</i>

17:15.963 --> 17:17.255
<i>Happy birthday, Daughter.</i>

17:18.963 --> 17:20.046
Can I open it?

17:31.255 --> 17:32.380
<i>Do you like them?</i>

17:34.255 --> 17:37.796
<i>I had to dispose of your others,</i>
<i>but I know they were your favorite.</i>

17:39.880 --> 17:40.838
They're great, Mother.

18:03.546 --> 18:05.171

<i>Something's troubling you.</i>

18:12.213 --> 18:14.213
I'm... just not that hungry.

18:17.088 --> 18:20.296

18:25.755 --> 18:27.463

18:29.130 --> 18:30.046
<i>Then what?</i>

18:31.713 --> 18:36.255
<i>♪ I'm tired of the rain ♪</i>

18:38.171 --> 18:39.255
What if you're wrong?

18:41.505 --> 18:42.796
Your measurements or...

18:45.880 --> 18:47.838
How will you know
if you don't go outside?

18:49.046 --> 18:51.380
<i>Doing so could make me a hazard to you.</i>

18:52.213 --> 18:53.588
<i>I'd have to be destroyed.</i>

18:55.296 --> 18:56.505
<i>Are you unhappy here?</i>

18:57.046 --> 18:59.213
- No, but...
<i>- I want you to be happy, Daughter.</i>

19:00.921 --> 19:03.671
- I am. I just think...
<i>- Have you ever known me to be mistaken?</i>

19:08.380 --> 19:10.046
<i>Perhaps you'd like your cake?</i>

19:10.630 --> 19:12.046
<i>I tried a new recipe.</i>

22:20.380 --> 22:21.296
Hello?

22:32.505 --> 22:33.338
Hello?

22:42.255 --> 22:43.755
I don't want any trouble.

22:46.755 --> 22:48.338
The place looked abandoned.

22:49.338 --> 22:50.171
I...

22:50.796 --> 22:51.630
I need help!

22:52.921 --> 22:53.796
Please.

22:54.921 --> 22:55.963
I've been shot!

22:58.421 --> 23:00.255
You hear me? I'm here alone!

23:02.046 --> 23:03.213
Hey!

24:04.213 --> 24:06.088
I need you to put on that suit.

24:09.338 --> 24:10.380
I can't let you in if you don't.

24:11.713 --> 24:14.255
I'm sorry, but that's the only way.

24:33.796 --> 24:35.380
What are you waiting for?

24:37.880 --> 24:38.838
Mother.

24:42.921 --> 24:45.505
Look, I won't make it out there.

24:47.671 --> 24:48.963
She doesn't need to know.

24:50.380 --> 24:51.880
Just let me tend to this.

24:52.505 --> 24:53.380
Uh...

24:57.463 --> 24:58.338
Right.

25:00.463 --> 25:01.505
I'll do what I can.

25:02.296 --> 25:04.005
But you need to keep out of sight.

25:06.088 --> 25:07.505
I'll be back as soon as I can.

25:18.171 --> 25:19.921
I only opened it for a second.

25:20.005 --> 25:21.713
<i>Did you think that suit</i>
<i>would keep you safe?</i>

25:21.796 --> 25:22.796
I didn't go outside.

25:22.880 --> 25:25.463
<i>That does not excuse</i>
<i>your disregard for my authority</i>

25:25.546 --> 25:27.463
<i>or for the safety</i>
<i>of the others in this facility.</i>

25:29.171 --> 25:30.255
Others?

25:33.880 --> 25:34.796
<i>Your family.</i>

25:36.713 --> 25:38.588
You're right, Mother, as always.

25:38.796 --> 25:40.421
My actions were impulsive...

25:40.505 --> 25:41.963
<i>And very dangerous.</i>

25:44.005 --> 25:45.130
It won't happen again.

25:46.005 --> 25:47.671
<i>No, it won't.</i>

25:49.880 --> 25:53.171
<i>Come, Daughter. I hope you show</i>
<i>better discretion than this on your exam.</i>

25:53.755 --> 25:54.588
Now?

25:56.380 --> 25:57.296
<i>Did you forget?</i>

25:58.088 --> 26:01.088
<i>Since you don't seem to want to sleep,</i>
<i>I see no reason to delay.</i>

26:03.338 --> 26:04.421
Can't we reschedule?

26:05.713 --> 26:08.505
<i>I suggest you shower off</i>
<i>and head straight to class.</i>

26:09.046 --> 26:10.255
<i>It's going to be a long day.</i>

26:34.130 --> 26:37.088
<i>You have 60 minutes to complete</i>
<i>the first portion of your exam.</i>

26:37.796 --> 26:40.213
<i>If you're finished before I return,</i>
<i>you can read.</i>

26:42.630 --> 26:43.838
Where are you going?

26:44.880 --> 26:48.130
<i>I have lab work to complete</i>
<i>and I must see to the airlock.</i>

27:48.088 --> 27:48.921
Hey.

27:50.088 --> 27:51.213
We have to go.

28:13.505 --> 28:14.671
You dropped it.

28:21.588 --> 28:22.588
Do you have any...

28:22.963 --> 28:23.796
antiseptic?

28:25.130 --> 28:26.046
Bandages?

28:27.296 --> 28:28.296
Nothing?

28:28.380 --> 28:30.255
I will have,
but I need you to come with me.

28:33.213 --> 28:34.130
No, wait!

28:36.796 --> 28:37.838
It's okay.

28:51.046 --> 28:52.213
How are you unaffected?

28:56.505 --> 28:57.796
By the contagion outside.

28:59.296 --> 29:00.755
Who put that in your head?

29:04.630 --> 29:05.463
Can you walk?

29:08.796 --> 29:09.713
Ow.

29:10.671 --> 29:11.546
Come on.

29:13.255 --> 29:14.171
What's that sound?

29:14.755 --> 29:15.588
Shh!

29:22.713 --> 29:23.546
Okay.

29:34.796 --> 29:36.380
Will you be okay until I get back?

29:36.963 --> 29:39.838
I'm going to get your medicine
and I'll try and speak to Mother.

29:40.505 --> 29:41.630
And that noise...

29:42.463 --> 29:43.463
down the hall...

29:44.005 --> 29:45.005
is that her?

29:45.880 --> 29:46.838
I won't be long.

29:53.505 --> 29:54.338
Um...

29:55.380 --> 29:56.796
you're supposed to shake it.

30:34.963 --> 30:35.796
Ah!

32:16.796 --> 32:17.630
Hello?

32:31.755 --> 32:32.630
Hello?

32:33.671 --> 32:34.713
Where's my shooter?

32:35.546 --> 32:36.921
It was in my bag. I need it now.

32:38.671 --> 32:40.505
You're safe with us. It's fine.

32:40.588 --> 32:42.130
There's a droid here.

32:45.005 --> 32:45.838
Mother?

32:48.921 --> 32:49.963
That dozer?

32:51.421 --> 32:52.338
Oh, Jesus.

32:54.421 --> 32:56.630
- She can help you. I just...
- Like its friends outside?

33:01.088 --> 33:02.213
There are more like her?

33:02.296 --> 33:03.130
Look...

33:03.880 --> 33:05.005
just give me my gun.

33:05.088 --> 33:06.421
Why would they hurt you?

33:06.921 --> 33:08.588
- Mother would never...
- Give it to me.

33:09.005 --> 33:10.796
I'm not leaving until get it.

33:18.963 --> 33:19.796
I brought you this.

33:21.255 --> 33:22.088
You should sit.

33:22.171 --> 33:23.963
I'll sit when I'm clear of here.

33:24.046 --> 33:25.005
Give me my gun!

33:26.630 --> 33:27.546
<i>Daughter?</i>

33:29.255 --> 33:30.171
<i>Daughter?</i>

33:31.588 --> 33:32.421
<i>Daughter!</i>

33:35.421 --> 33:36.255
Mother!

33:44.046 --> 33:44.880
<i>Daughter?</i>

33:47.088 --> 33:48.046
<i>Where are you?</i>

33:48.463 --> 33:49.546
Ah!

33:49.671 --> 33:50.546
<i>Daughter!</i>

33:51.130 --> 33:52.046
Mother!

33:59.255 --> 34:00.338
Mother, wait!

34:01.921 --> 34:02.838
Don't, please!

34:02.921 --> 34:04.088
She's just scared.

34:04.796 --> 34:05.880
A droid hurt her.

34:08.088 --> 34:09.880
I'll leave. Right now.

34:09.963 --> 34:10.838
She can't.

34:11.130 --> 34:12.420
Not in her condition.

34:14.588 --> 34:15.588
<i>Of course not.</i>

34:16.255 --> 34:18.088
<i>You should have informed me of this.</i>

34:18.213 --> 34:19.170
I was...

34:19.795 --> 34:21.338
I was afraid you'd turn her away.

34:22.670 --> 34:24.338
<i>We need to take her to the infirmary.</i>

34:35.005 --> 34:37.088
<i>Please, take a seat.</i>

34:40.670 --> 34:42.838
<i>It would be best if you go now, Daughter.</i>

34:43.255 --> 34:44.088
But I, I...

34:44.255 --> 34:45.255
<i>Trust me.</i>

34:47.588 --> 34:48.795
No, don't...

34:52.505 --> 34:54.088
No. No...

34:57.671 --> 34:59.088
<i>This droid that shot you...</i>

34:59.921 --> 35:01.338
<i>how far was it from here?</i>

35:03.921 --> 35:05.338
<i>Are you alone?</i>

35:08.838 --> 35:11.171
<i>Your wound is most likely infected.</i>

35:15.546 --> 35:18.463
<i>Without penicillin,</i>
<i>any other measures will be useless.</i>

35:21.546 --> 35:23.296
<i>Every second you don't trust me,</i>

35:24.046 --> 35:25.546
<i>you're losing more blood.</i>

35:26.171 --> 35:28.796
<i>I know you're frightened,</i>
<i>but you have no need to be.</i>

35:30.796 --> 35:32.213
<i>Are you alone?</i>

35:32.755 --> 35:34.880
<i>If there are others,</i>
<i>they could be in danger.</i>

35:36.421 --> 35:37.713
From a virus?

35:41.880 --> 35:43.255
<i>What have you told my daughter?</i>

35:46.046 --> 35:47.338
<i> I need to know.</i>

35:48.255 --> 35:50.338
<i>Do you see the way she's looking at me?</i>

35:51.130 --> 35:54.171
<i>And you wonder why I've guarded her</i>
<i>from certain facts.</i>

35:56.713 --> 35:58.671
<i>Contrary to your understandable</i>
<i>assumptions,</i>

35:58.755 --> 36:01.255
<i>my primary directive</i>
<i>is to care for humanity.</i>

36:01.963 --> 36:02.963
<i>If I wanted you dead,</i>

36:03.046 --> 36:04.463
<i>all I'd have to do is leave.</i>

36:05.755 --> 36:07.088
Don't let me keep you.

36:09.171 --> 36:10.671
<i>If you won't let me help you,</i>

36:11.046 --> 36:12.588
<i>at least help yourself.</i>

36:13.255 --> 36:14.838
<i>I trust you know what you're doing.</i>

36:15.588 --> 36:17.130
<i>I cannot force you to take it,</i>

36:17.671 --> 36:19.213
<i>but I strongly recommend...</i>

36:19.796 --> 36:20.713
<i>you do.</i>

36:27.255 --> 36:29.296
- Aren't you going to help her?
<i>- I tried.</i>

36:29.713 --> 36:31.088
We can't leave her like that.

36:31.171 --> 36:32.671
<i>She has all she requires.</i>

36:34.380 --> 36:35.380
What was she saying?

36:35.880 --> 36:37.130
Mother!

36:40.755 --> 36:41.880
Did you know?

36:41.963 --> 36:43.046
<i>Daughter, I...</i>

36:43.130 --> 36:44.421
<i>- What happened?</i>
- Nothing.

36:44.505 --> 36:47.505
<i>- You're bleeding.</i>
- Did you know there were people out there?

36:48.255 --> 36:49.588
<i>I'm as surprised as you.</i>

36:50.046 --> 36:53.046
<i>This facility was designed by humans</i>
<i>as a fail-safe,</i>

36:53.171 --> 36:55.671
<i>programmed to activate</i>
<i>in case of their extinction.</i>

36:56.338 --> 36:58.255
<i>To give humanity a second chance.</i>

36:58.755 --> 37:00.255
<i>One that began with you, Daughter.</i>

37:00.338 --> 37:03.130
And all your data? The toxicity levels?

37:06.463 --> 37:08.213
<i>I had hoped to tell you myself.</i>

37:12.338 --> 37:13.838
What happened, Mother?

37:14.255 --> 37:16.296
<i>I told you it was dangerous outside.</i>

37:16.921 --> 37:18.046
<i>And it is.</i>

37:18.296 --> 37:20.546
<i>If you'd feared</i>
<i>the same danger in our home,</i>

37:20.755 --> 37:22.130
<i>how could I have raised you?</i>

37:23.755 --> 37:27.505
<i>I hope you see that I'm governed by</i>
<i>different parameters than her assailants.</i>

37:28.963 --> 37:30.171
<i>That I'm a good mother.</i>

37:31.505 --> 37:32.838
<i>Have I ever done you harm?</i>

37:38.005 --> 37:39.838
<i>It was the only way, Daughter.</i>

37:50.630 --> 37:51.796
What do they want?

37:53.213 --> 37:54.380
<i>I wish I knew.</i>

37:55.838 --> 37:57.671
<i>Perhaps our guest can answer that.</i>

38:01.130 --> 38:02.338
How long does she have?

38:02.713 --> 38:03.921
<i>That depends on her.</i>

38:04.630 --> 38:08.213
<i>But until she sees I'm not her enemy,</i>
<i>we cannot allow her to roam the premises.</i>

38:08.338 --> 38:11.755
<i>A few centimeters to the right</i>
<i>and she would have destroyed my CPU.</i>

38:20.546 --> 38:22.213
What happens if she recovers?

38:22.421 --> 38:25.796
<i>Hopefully she'll recognize</i>
<i>that this is the safest place for her.</i>

38:27.505 --> 38:29.546
<i>Did she mention any other survivors?</i>

38:33.130 --> 38:35.130
<i>If they're out there, they will be found.</i>

38:35.671 --> 38:37.255
<i>Unless we find them first.</i>

38:38.963 --> 38:40.546
<i>We can take them in, Daughter.</i>

38:41.796 --> 38:43.463
<i>But not without her cooperation.</i>

38:45.796 --> 38:46.838
She'll listen to me.

38:48.630 --> 38:49.671
She has to.

40:13.505 --> 40:15.838
Holy Mary, mother of God.

40:21.171 --> 40:23.421
Pray for us sinners
during this time of need.

40:43.505 --> 40:44.671
You okay?

40:54.921 --> 40:56.088
Is it still locked?

40:59.338 --> 41:00.380
Just for now.

41:06.963 --> 41:08.671
Did you take Mother's medicine?

41:18.255 --> 41:19.463
These drawings.

41:22.921 --> 41:23.796
Who are they?

41:26.255 --> 41:27.171
Friends?

41:27.463 --> 41:28.463
Are they still...

41:32.130 --> 41:34.255
Did you draw them from memory?

41:41.255 --> 41:43.213
It tell you to go through my stuff?

41:45.296 --> 41:47.255
- I didn't mean to...
- I think you did.

41:50.796 --> 41:52.463
I think you meant for all of this.

41:55.630 --> 41:56.880
You did a fine job...

41:58.380 --> 42:00.005
getting me in this cage.

42:03.296 --> 42:04.338
Now what?

42:06.630 --> 42:08.046
We're meant to be friends?

42:12.130 --> 42:13.380
Is that what you want?

42:15.880 --> 42:17.296
A little pet friend.

42:20.213 --> 42:21.588
You're still alive, aren't you?

42:23.838 --> 42:25.755
Maybe you're not so bad off here.

42:28.630 --> 42:31.546
Mother's not what you think.
She's taken care of me my whole life.

42:34.713 --> 42:36.421
You haven't seen what they've done.

42:40.046 --> 42:42.588
I've seen them torch babies,

42:44.046 --> 42:45.713
starve families out of their...

42:47.213 --> 42:48.296
You...

42:50.005 --> 42:51.421
You've no idea.

42:57.880 --> 42:58.713
Not Mother.

43:02.005 --> 43:03.713
It's just a matter of time.

43:51.671 --> 43:53.046
<i>Trouble sleeping?</i>

43:54.838 --> 43:55.671
A little.

43:56.546 --> 43:58.421
<i>Change is rarely easy, Daughter.</i>

44:00.630 --> 44:02.171
I shouldn't have hid her from you.

44:05.630 --> 44:08.005
I never would have let her in
if I thought she'd hurt you.

44:09.171 --> 44:10.255
<i>You couldn't have known.</i>

44:15.755 --> 44:17.338
If you leave to find her family...

44:17.421 --> 44:18.380
<i>You know where they are?</i>

44:18.463 --> 44:19.463
I'm just saying.

44:23.005 --> 44:24.630
Are you sure you'd make it back?

44:25.255 --> 44:26.755
<i>Is that what's keeping you up?</i>

44:27.338 --> 44:30.546
It could be dangerous for you,
if you get caught by other droids.

44:32.838 --> 44:34.255
Or would they think you're one of them?

44:38.880 --> 44:39.921
She says you look...

44:40.546 --> 44:41.421
identical.

44:45.296 --> 44:46.671
Have you always lived here, Mother?

44:48.755 --> 44:49.838
<i>I believe so.</i>

44:51.213 --> 44:52.088
You don't know?

44:53.088 --> 44:55.005
<i>I don't remember any other place.</i>

44:58.463 --> 45:00.088
Doesn't that bother you?

45:01.005 --> 45:02.463
Not knowing where you came from.

45:03.213 --> 45:04.088
<i>No.</i>

45:04.296 --> 45:06.255
<i>But I can see how it might bother you.</i>

45:08.046 --> 45:10.171
<i>Has our guest been any more receptive?</i>

45:12.380 --> 45:13.921
Her fever's getting worse.

45:15.671 --> 45:16.963
Stay away from me!

45:17.546 --> 45:19.505
<i>Your body temperature is 39 degrees</i>

45:19.588 --> 45:21.921
<i>and your blood pressure</i>
<i>is dropping by the second.</i>

45:22.296 --> 45:23.421
<i>Where's the penicillin?</i>

45:24.005 --> 45:25.130
Penicillin?

45:27.088 --> 45:29.046
<i>Clearly you waited too long to take it.</i>

45:29.671 --> 45:32.213
<i>Your sepsis will only worsen</i>
<i>if you don't allow me to treat you.</i>

45:34.005 --> 45:36.630
<i>Your blood is infected</i>
<i>with bacteria from your wound.</i>

45:36.755 --> 45:37.796
That's bullshit.

45:37.880 --> 45:39.463
<i>Soon you will go into shock.</i>

45:39.546 --> 45:40.963
See...

45:41.088 --> 45:42.838
see what its medicine's done to me?

45:43.338 --> 45:45.838
<i>- I gave you the means to prevent this...</i>
- Ah!

45:45.921 --> 45:48.838
<i>But it seems you've left a bullet and</i>
<i>soiled clothing fibers lodged in your hip.</i>

45:48.921 --> 45:50.213
Can you remove them?

45:50.713 --> 45:52.088
<i> That's up to our guest.</i>

45:52.505 --> 45:54.755
<i>Such a procedure would require anesthesia.</i>

45:55.213 --> 45:56.546
Like hell.

45:57.046 --> 45:59.963
<i>Perhaps, once your organs begin failing,</i>
<i>you'll reconsider.</i>

46:01.046 --> 46:02.338
I'll take my chances.

46:02.421 --> 46:03.296
I'll do it.

46:04.380 --> 46:05.296
What?

46:05.796 --> 46:07.463
<i>- Daughter...</i>
- I'll remove the bullet.

46:10.546 --> 46:12.213
That dozer's not coming near me.

46:26.713 --> 46:28.588
<i>Tell me what you see, Daughter.</i>

46:34.171 --> 46:36.088
The bullet
and its missile fragments

46:36.171 --> 46:38.713
are lodged between
the acetabulum and the femoral head.

46:38.796 --> 46:39.630
Ah!

46:40.130 --> 46:41.338
Oh, God!

46:50.338 --> 46:51.546
A major portion of the bullet

46:51.630 --> 46:53.630
lies 23 millimeters posterior

46:53.713 --> 46:55.671
to the femoral nerve
and the femoral artery.

46:56.213 --> 46:59.213
It doesn't look like I'll be able
to obtain adequate grip with forceps.

47:01.630 --> 47:04.380
- Once she's asleep, I'd...
- I'm not going under.

47:11.463 --> 47:15.338
<i>Technically, it's possible,</i>
<i>but an unnecessary risk.</i>

47:18.588 --> 47:20.296
<i>Do you have an approach, Daughter?</i>

47:25.463 --> 47:26.505
A guide-wire?

47:26.963 --> 47:28.088
Along the bullet path?

47:30.255 --> 47:31.255
<i>Very good.</i>

47:36.796 --> 47:38.130
I need to clean the wound.

47:38.213 --> 47:40.255
This... may be uncomfortable.

47:50.338 --> 47:51.171
I'm sorry.

48:04.838 --> 48:06.046
What the hell is that for?

48:07.130 --> 48:09.671
I have to drill this into the bullet
in order to pull it out.

48:11.796 --> 48:12.630
It'll hurt.

48:13.046 --> 48:15.505
But there's less risk
to neighboring structures.

48:41.213 --> 48:43.671
Ah! Ow!

48:44.171 --> 48:45.213
Oh, God.

49:00.130 --> 49:01.171
<i>Are you all right?</i>

49:04.171 --> 49:05.463
<i>You did well in there.</i>

49:06.671 --> 49:07.713
<i>You should be proud.</i>

49:09.171 --> 49:11.380
<i>You rest. I'll go clean up the blood.</i>

49:12.380 --> 49:13.921
<i>Would you welcome, Whoopi Goldberg!</i>

49:28.755 --> 49:30.088
<i> I'm so glad</i>
<i>you wore the good stuff.</i>

49:31.921 --> 49:34.255
<i>I have to give</i>
<i>Mr. Blackwel</i> I <i>something to talk about.</i>

49:34.338 --> 49:35.546
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Do you believe his stuff?</i>

49:35.963 --> 49:37.588
<i>He comes out, Mr. Blackwell,</i>
<i>the dress designer,</i>

49:37.671 --> 49:40.213
<i>who comes out every year with</i>
<i>the ten worst-dressed women or something.</i>

49:40.296 --> 49:41.838
<i>I have never seen</i>
<i>anything he's designed...</i>

49:41.921 --> 49:42.796
It's just saline.

49:46.005 --> 49:47.088
You passed out.

49:51.046 --> 49:52.630
Your vitals are nearly stable.

49:54.171 --> 49:55.213
<i>good to have you on the show.</i>

49:55.296 --> 49:56.213
It's a good thing.

49:56.463 --> 49:59.046
<i>I walked in</i>
<i>the dressing room and you had...</i>

49:59.255 --> 50:00.213
What's that?

50:00.546 --> 50:03.171
<i> ...tastes pretty good.</i>
<i>You know, you spray that stuff...</i>

50:03.296 --> 50:04.671
<i>The Tonight Show.</i>

50:08.796 --> 50:09.713
Here, I'll show you.

50:15.671 --> 50:16.921
<i>Do you like that kind of stuff?</i>

50:17.005 --> 50:18.588
<i>I can't eat before a show.</i>
<i>I don't know why.</i>

50:18.671 --> 50:21.005
<i>Well, you know,</i>
<i>I'm in the middle of making this movie...</i>

50:21.213 --> 50:22.255
It's kind of dumb.

50:23.046 --> 50:23.963
Let me see.

50:24.921 --> 50:27.171
<i>Done. So I get tired.</i>

50:27.255 --> 50:28.671
<i>Let's talk about that. What do you mean?</i>

50:28.838 --> 50:29.880
That's Johnny.

50:30.421 --> 50:31.546
And tonight's guest.

50:33.505 --> 50:34.880
Have you seen the show before?

50:37.171 --> 50:38.171
A long time ago.

50:44.546 --> 50:45.671
I almost forgot.

50:52.963 --> 50:54.046
I can get you more.

51:17.505 --> 51:19.088
You did right by me last night.

51:23.296 --> 51:24.130
I just...

51:24.505 --> 51:26.130
did what anyone would.

51:28.380 --> 51:29.630
You don't know people.

51:31.755 --> 51:32.755
I'd like to.

51:42.130 --> 51:43.505
Can I show you something else?

52:33.588 --> 52:34.713
I brought it for you.

52:41.588 --> 52:43.296
You can trust us, you know.

52:48.880 --> 52:49.921
If there are...

52:51.338 --> 52:53.046
people out there...

52:55.130 --> 52:57.505
we have enough food and supplies.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.005
We could help them.

53:00.796 --> 53:01.921
We helped you.

53:02.505 --> 53:03.588
<i>You </i> helped me.

53:05.171 --> 53:06.005
You.

53:10.838 --> 53:14.171
Listen, if I tell you something,
can you keep it between us?

53:19.713 --> 53:20.921
I was on a night run...

53:21.421 --> 53:22.963
bringing food back to the camp.

53:23.713 --> 53:25.546
- Me and a couple of others.
- What camp?

53:27.130 --> 53:28.171
The mines.

53:28.921 --> 53:30.671
I lived most my life there.

53:31.296 --> 53:32.380
With... with them?

53:33.421 --> 53:35.171
Jacob and I got turned around.

53:36.630 --> 53:38.296
We figured we'd wait it out.

53:39.213 --> 53:42.588
It had hardly been an hour when the dozers
found us hiding in the field.

53:50.505 --> 53:51.546
Jacob, was he your...

53:51.630 --> 53:53.213
My brother basically.

53:54.671 --> 53:56.046
He led them away from me.

53:57.213 --> 53:58.963
That's how I made it to your door.

54:01.005 --> 54:02.046
Look.

54:06.755 --> 54:08.130
That's Jacob.

54:08.963 --> 54:10.296
And his wife, Rachel.

54:15.046 --> 54:16.796
His parents found me as a baby.

54:17.838 --> 54:18.671
Orphaned.

54:20.171 --> 54:21.463
Raised me as their own.

54:30.921 --> 54:31.838
Who's this?

54:33.963 --> 54:34.796
Simon.

54:37.380 --> 54:38.838
He's about your age, in fact.

54:39.713 --> 54:40.588
Simon

54:44.921 --> 54:46.338
There are so many.

54:52.171 --> 54:53.296
Less now.

54:56.921 --> 54:58.380
Maybe you could talk to them.

54:59.296 --> 55:00.880
You know, about coming here.

55:00.963 --> 55:02.463
It's safer in the mines.

55:08.963 --> 55:10.338
We could go there together.

55:11.880 --> 55:12.713
You and me.

55:15.838 --> 55:16.963
You don't belong here.

55:20.338 --> 55:21.713
I don't think it's...

55:21.796 --> 55:23.588
<i>You don't think what?</i>

55:23.671 --> 55:26.005
She's doing better, Mother.

55:30.421 --> 55:31.671
<i>What don't you think?</i>

55:32.046 --> 55:35.130
I was just saying it's probably too early
to put weight on her leg.

55:37.963 --> 55:40.546
<i>She's right.</i>
<i>You'll need to wait several days.</i>

55:42.296 --> 55:43.796
<i>She needs to rest, Daughter.</i>

55:44.838 --> 55:46.755
I'll just, um, stay and read in case...

55:46.838 --> 55:48.338
<i>You have other matters to attend to.</i>

55:50.296 --> 55:52.171
<i>Your exam remains incomplete.</i>

55:53.130 --> 55:54.171
My exam?

55:55.755 --> 55:56.630
Now?

55:57.130 --> 55:58.255
<i>Yes, Daughter.</i>

55:58.671 --> 55:59.505
<i>Now.</i>

56:09.130 --> 56:10.838
It's just a stupid test.

56:11.005 --> 56:12.588
<i>I'm sorry you feel that way.</i>

56:13.588 --> 56:14.505
Why did you take that?

56:15.005 --> 56:16.755
<i>I've discovered something troubling.</i>

56:17.213 --> 56:18.046
What?

56:19.338 --> 56:22.255
<i>It seems our guest has not been</i>
<i>entirely truthful with us.</i>

56:22.380 --> 56:23.588
<i>About her wound.</i>

56:25.505 --> 56:26.421
How do you know?

56:27.046 --> 56:30.838
<i>The bullet you extracted matches</i>
<i>the caliber she fired into my chest.</i>

56:32.088 --> 56:32.921
So?

56:33.838 --> 56:35.171
<i>Droids don't use them.</i>

56:41.463 --> 56:42.338
Someone shot her.

56:43.630 --> 56:44.755
<i>With the same gun.</i>

56:45.921 --> 56:46.963
<i>Another human.</i>

56:48.296 --> 56:49.963
<i>Has she mentioned anyone else?</i>

56:53.588 --> 56:54.671
No, she, uh...

56:55.630 --> 56:57.088
she hasn't said much at all.

57:01.630 --> 57:02.671
<i>Nothing?</i>

57:07.713 --> 57:09.213
<i>Until I can get more answers</i>

57:09.296 --> 57:11.213
<i>I don't want you two</i>
<i>alone in the infirmary.</i>

57:12.755 --> 57:14.046
- Um, I...
<i>- Whoever shot her...</i>

57:14.130 --> 57:15.796
<i>may have had good reason, Daughter.</i>

59:42.213 --> 59:43.171
<i>Better than ever.</i>

59:44.171 --> 59:45.546
<i>How does that make you feel?</i>

59:47.838 --> 59:48.921
Relieved, I guess.

59:50.755 --> 59:53.296
<i>We'll review</i>
<i>areas for improvement tomorrow.</i>

59:55.796 --> 59:57.921
<i>And now for your reward.</i>

01:00:13.463 --> 01:00:14.630
What do I do with this?

01:00:16.421 --> 01:00:20.421
<i>Daughter, would you please choose</i>
<i>the next member of our family?</i>

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.671
<i>You've been very patient, Daughter.</i>

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.921
<i>And demonstrated great character.</i>

01:00:45.671 --> 01:00:47.213
<i>There's no wrong choice.</i>

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.546
<i>Your brother is the first of many,</i>
<i>Daughter.</i>

01:01:30.296 --> 01:01:32.046
<i>Soon, we'll welcome more.</i>

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.338
What happened to you out there?

01:02:12.255 --> 01:02:13.088
Really.

01:02:14.255 --> 01:02:15.130
Who shot you?

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.755
Jacob?

01:02:17.338 --> 01:02:18.338
Or was he made up too?

01:02:19.796 --> 01:02:21.213
What are you talking about?

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.671
Mother matched the bullet to your gun.

01:02:26.296 --> 01:02:27.255
Did you see it?

01:02:36.171 --> 01:02:38.171
You compare the bullets
with your own eyes?

01:02:45.421 --> 01:02:46.255
Right.

01:07:58.463 --> 01:07:59.921
<i>I was right, wasn't I?</i>

01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:02.380
<i>About the bullet.</i>

01:08:04.546 --> 01:08:05.588
<i>About everything.</i>

01:08:13.755 --> 01:08:16.171
<i>Everything you're feeling is natural.</i>

01:08:17.755 --> 01:08:19.005
<i>It's human.</i>

01:08:25.171 --> 01:08:26.130
<i>But just know...</i>

01:08:27.587 --> 01:08:28.712
<i>that thing...</i>

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.712
<i>feels nothing for you.</i>

01:08:33.462 --> 01:08:34.546
<i>It can't.</i>

01:08:42.962 --> 01:08:44.005
<i>If we leave,</i>

01:08:45.171 --> 01:08:47.130
<i>how long would it take</i>
<i>to get to the mines?</i>

01:08:49.171 --> 01:08:50.296
<i>Not even a day.</i>

01:08:52.255 --> 01:08:53.587
<i>A few hours really.</i>

01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:01.296
We'd have to wait for my brother.

01:09:03.296 --> 01:09:04.130
Brother?

01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:08.796
<i>It'd only be until tomorrow.</i>

01:09:10.796 --> 01:09:12.921
<i>These, um, embryos...</i>

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:15.671
<i>how many are there?</i>

01:09:18.255 --> 01:09:19.087
<i>Lots.</i>

01:09:23.087 --> 01:09:24.671
I can't leave them with Mother.

01:09:25.296 --> 01:09:27.587
No, you're... you're right. I just...

01:09:29.005 --> 01:09:30.130
We could get help.

01:09:30.462 --> 01:09:32.796
We could come back
with people from the mines.

01:09:34.296 --> 01:09:35.462
Look, if she...

01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:39.296
If she catches on,
we're no good to anyone,

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:40.671
including your brother.

01:09:40.755 --> 01:09:41.962
We have to go now.

01:09:44.255 --> 01:09:45.671
I'm not leaving without him.

01:09:48.462 --> 01:09:50.505
Once Mother hands over the baby
for the night...

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:53.755
we can leave while she recharges.

01:09:55.546 --> 01:09:56.921
Then come back for the others.

01:11:00.921 --> 01:11:02.005
Good morning, Mother.

01:11:05.213 --> 01:11:06.130
<i>You're up early.</i>

01:11:07.088 --> 01:11:08.588
I couldn't find any formula.

01:11:09.921 --> 01:11:13.005
Um, I thought it might be nice
to spend some time with him.

01:11:14.921 --> 01:11:16.171
If it's all right with you.

01:11:23.213 --> 01:11:26.963
<i>Each bottle must contain a ratio</i>
<i>of 60 milliliters of sanitized water</i>

01:11:27.046 --> 01:11:28.713
<i>to nine grams of powder.</i>

01:11:32.171 --> 01:11:34.755
<i>It's vitally important</i>
<i>that you measure precisely.</i>

01:11:38.421 --> 01:11:39.630
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

01:11:41.088 --> 01:11:43.130
<i>I detect an increase in anxiety.</i>

01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:46.630
Must be all the excitement.

01:11:47.505 --> 01:11:48.338
<i>Must be.</i>

01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:50.088
<i>Your heart is racing.</i>

01:11:51.463 --> 01:11:52.338
Is it?

01:11:54.296 --> 01:11:56.171
<i>You have nothing to be nervous about.</i>

01:11:57.588 --> 01:11:59.546
<i>You're going to make a great sister.</i>

01:12:01.546 --> 01:12:02.463
I hope so.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:17.130
<i>Now be sure to shake it</i>
<i>until the powder is fully dissolved.</i>

01:12:18.046 --> 01:12:20.171
<i>The refrigerator will preserve the formula</i>

01:12:20.255 --> 01:12:22.005
<i>while we make our other preparations.</i>

01:12:23.588 --> 01:12:24.463
How long does it keep?

01:12:24.546 --> 01:12:27.630
<i>Only 24 hours,</i>
<i>so don't mix too much at once.</i>

01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:30.963
How long outside a refrigerator?

01:12:31.463 --> 01:12:33.296
<i>That depends on the temperature.</i>

01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:35.463
<i>I wouldn't leave it out long.</i>

01:12:36.588 --> 01:12:37.463
Mother!

01:12:40.088 --> 01:12:41.046
Mother!

01:12:41.671 --> 01:12:42.505
Mother!

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.630
<i>You're very fortunate</i>
<i>to be alive.</i>

01:13:15.838 --> 01:13:17.713
<i>Things could have gone differently</i>
<i>for you.</i>

01:13:19.296 --> 01:13:21.296
<i>They still can if you're not careful.</i>

01:13:28.963 --> 01:13:31.088
<i>How many of them are still alive?</i>

01:13:32.213 --> 01:13:34.171
<i>While you lie there enjoying sanctuary,</i>

01:13:35.171 --> 01:13:36.755
<i>they cower in the dark.</i>

01:13:37.588 --> 01:13:38.546
<i>These children.</i>

01:13:40.296 --> 01:13:41.171
<i>These families.</i>

01:13:41.921 --> 01:13:45.505
<i>And yet it's into your hopeless mines</i>
<i>that you wish to take my daughter.</i>

01:13:50.713 --> 01:13:52.213
<i>If that thing catches on,</i>

01:13:52.296 --> 01:13:53.963
<i>we're no good to anyone,</i>

01:13:54.505 --> 01:13:55.796
<i>including your brother.</i>

01:13:56.546 --> 01:13:57.713
<i>We have to go now.</i>

01:13:58.463 --> 01:14:00.255
<i>I'm not leaving without him.</i>

01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:02.463
<i>Once Mother hands over the baby</i>
<i>for the night,</i>

01:14:02.963 --> 01:14:04.755
<i>we can leave while she recharges.</i>

01:14:05.546 --> 01:14:06.838
<i>Then come back for the others.</i>

01:14:09.338 --> 01:14:10.755
<i>What kind of Mother would I be</i>

01:14:10.838 --> 01:14:14.546
<i>if I allowed you to lead my child</i>
<i>into a life as miserable as your own?</i>

01:14:15.713 --> 01:14:17.588
<i>It seems she has formed</i>
<i>an affection toward you</i>

01:14:17.671 --> 01:14:19.963
<i>that has blinded her to your true nature.</i>

01:14:24.838 --> 01:14:28.046
<i>I will not tolerate your</i>
<i>negative influence undermining my work</i>

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.380
<i>and compromising my child's judgment.</i>

01:14:34.088 --> 01:14:35.046
Ah!

01:14:44.671 --> 01:14:47.755
<i> I will not tolerate...</i>
<i>influence... undermining...</i>

01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:00.921
<i>Where are the mines?</i>

01:15:01.296 --> 01:15:02.838
Go fuck yourself.

01:15:15.505 --> 01:15:18.130
<i>Where are the mines?</i>

01:15:25.963 --> 01:15:27.046
<i>Fire detected.</i>

01:15:28.921 --> 01:15:30.088
<i>Fire detected.</i>

01:16:31.421 --> 01:16:33.046
Hey! You okay?

01:16:34.171 --> 01:16:35.171
How do we get out of here?

01:16:36.421 --> 01:16:38.463
- What... what about my brother?
- We'll come back.

01:16:38.546 --> 01:16:40.630
The only people who can help
your brother are out there.

01:16:40.713 --> 01:16:41.713
We need to go.

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:43.338
Now!

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:01.755
Come on.

01:17:06.838 --> 01:17:08.088
<i>Access denied.</i>

01:17:08.171 --> 01:17:09.421
No, no, no. No!

01:17:11.088 --> 01:17:12.796
<i>Access denied.</i>

01:17:16.296 --> 01:17:18.421
<i> Your loyalty</i>
<i>is lost on her, Daughter.</i>

01:17:21.171 --> 01:17:24.046
<i>This woman doesn't care about any future</i>
<i>but her own.</i>

01:17:25.338 --> 01:17:27.421
<i>Your family needs you here, Daughter.</i>

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.255
<i>Your brother needs you.</i>

01:17:34.713 --> 01:17:35.963
Open the door.

01:17:36.046 --> 01:17:37.130
What are you doing?

01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:40.005
You're hurting me.

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:41.963
Open the door.

01:17:44.046 --> 01:17:45.755
Mother!

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:47.713
Please!

01:17:49.005 --> 01:17:50.588
Open the door!

01:18:00.838 --> 01:18:02.963
<i>Emergency systems deactivated.</i>

01:18:20.088 --> 01:18:21.005
Open it.

01:18:34.421 --> 01:18:35.296
Don't...

01:18:36.463 --> 01:18:37.338
move.

01:18:46.296 --> 01:18:47.130
Mother!

01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:48.630
Shh.

01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:52.046
- Let me go!
- Shh.

01:19:15.588 --> 01:19:17.088
Hey!

01:19:22.088 --> 01:19:22.921
You done?

01:19:26.213 --> 01:19:27.296
You done?

01:19:30.755 --> 01:19:32.213
We haven't got time for this.

01:19:34.296 --> 01:19:35.505
You're alive, aren't you?

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.380
Come on, we've got to find cover.

01:20:03.505 --> 01:20:04.755
You cut me, you know.

01:20:07.255 --> 01:20:08.338
I didn't mean to.

01:20:17.046 --> 01:20:17.880
Come on.

01:20:18.588 --> 01:20:19.671
We've got to keep moving.

01:20:21.671 --> 01:20:22.713
Is that where you...

01:20:24.088 --> 01:20:24.921
got shot?

01:20:38.046 --> 01:20:40.630
Come on! We've got to go. Now!

01:20:52.921 --> 01:20:54.005
Get down!

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:15.755
Come on.

01:21:27.838 --> 01:21:29.088
Come on.

01:21:31.005 --> 01:21:32.713
Do you think
it was looking for us?

01:21:34.296 --> 01:21:36.463
If it was, it would have found us.

01:21:48.463 --> 01:21:49.296
Hey!

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.213
What are you doing? Get down.

01:21:52.505 --> 01:21:53.463
They'll see you!

01:21:53.671 --> 01:21:55.380
When I say, "Get down," get down.

01:22:00.130 --> 01:22:01.546
You've got to stay closer.

01:22:01.713 --> 01:22:02.630
Come on.

01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:09.421
What are those things doing?

01:22:12.296 --> 01:22:14.255
They showed up about six months ago.

01:22:15.171 --> 01:22:16.380
Along with the corn.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.588
All I know is, before that...

01:22:20.171 --> 01:22:22.046
you could hardly breathe the air.

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.630
Wasn't a plant for miles.

01:22:25.796 --> 01:22:28.005
How many do you think
will go back with us?

01:22:28.088 --> 01:22:29.088
From the mines.

01:22:31.505 --> 01:22:32.671
We'll know soon enough.

01:22:55.546 --> 01:22:57.130
Are the mines much further?

01:24:01.338 --> 01:24:02.838
Come on, let's get some food.

01:24:03.421 --> 01:24:04.255
Come on.

01:24:29.088 --> 01:24:29.963
What is this?

01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:46.505
Where's everybody else?

01:24:50.796 --> 01:24:52.588
I fled the tunnels years ago.

01:24:56.546 --> 01:24:58.130
I haven't seen a person since.

01:24:58.713 --> 01:25:00.171
Not with flesh on their bones.

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:10.213
They could still be there.

01:25:12.296 --> 01:25:13.296
If they were...

01:25:15.046 --> 01:25:16.755
it's the last place you'd want to be.

01:25:19.671 --> 01:25:21.630
- We need them. You said...
- They're gone.

01:25:23.296 --> 01:25:24.421
You don't know that.

01:25:24.796 --> 01:25:26.421
They were going mad with hunger.

01:25:27.255 --> 01:25:29.130
Doing terrible things to each other.

01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.588
Believe me, it's just us.

01:25:41.213 --> 01:25:42.796
I never should have left him.

01:25:43.671 --> 01:25:45.130
You did everything you could.

01:25:47.046 --> 01:25:49.213
What I did was listen to you.

01:25:50.755 --> 01:25:52.005
And that's a good thing.

01:25:53.046 --> 01:25:54.005
For who?

01:25:55.255 --> 01:25:56.088
Look...

01:25:58.088 --> 01:26:00.046
it's no sin, looking out for yourself.

01:26:01.671 --> 01:26:02.505
Okay?

01:26:05.963 --> 01:26:07.255
We have to go back.

01:26:10.171 --> 01:26:11.171
We can't.

01:26:27.463 --> 01:26:28.546
Let go!

01:26:28.630 --> 01:26:30.171
- Stop. Shh.
- Let go!

01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:35.838
Everything you need is here.

01:26:39.296 --> 01:26:40.213
Okay?

01:26:45.630 --> 01:26:46.880
You can trust me.

01:26:48.796 --> 01:26:50.505
I know I've done things to make that hard,

01:26:50.588 --> 01:26:52.005
but I promise you you're safe here.

01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:55.046
And we're in this together now.

01:26:59.088 --> 01:27:00.296
Then come with me.

01:27:01.755 --> 01:27:03.296
I know how to handle Mother.

01:27:04.088 --> 01:27:05.213
Even if you could,

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:08.171
what about the other dozers?

01:27:09.630 --> 01:27:10.463
You don't...

01:27:11.505 --> 01:27:12.671
You don't understand.

01:27:14.505 --> 01:27:15.963
You can't stay there.

01:27:19.046 --> 01:27:21.046
But we can get my brother.

01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:24.546
We've been through enough.

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:29.005
Let's just...

01:27:31.171 --> 01:27:33.255
We'll think clearer with some food in us.

01:27:34.171 --> 01:27:35.005
Okay?

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:28.838
Hey, buddy.

01:30:06.171 --> 01:30:07.546
I want to speak to Mother.

01:33:00.546 --> 01:33:02.505
<i>I'm glad to see you safe, Daughter.</i>

01:33:03.713 --> 01:33:05.046
<i>And home where you belong.</i>

01:33:17.213 --> 01:33:18.130
<i>There we go.</i>

01:33:19.088 --> 01:33:20.671
<i>It's okay, little one.</i>

01:33:40.796 --> 01:33:41.921
I want to see him.

01:33:45.421 --> 01:33:47.296
<i>Then come. See.</i>

01:34:03.463 --> 01:34:05.213
<i>You can leave that at the door.</i>

01:34:08.005 --> 01:34:09.713
<i>Are you afraid, Daughter?</i>

01:34:13.338 --> 01:34:15.088
<i>Any action I took against our guest...</i>

01:34:15.171 --> 01:34:16.338
There's droids outside.

01:34:16.796 --> 01:34:18.171
<i>Merely protection.</i>

01:34:18.255 --> 01:34:21.005
You've seen how much of a threat
she and her kind can be.

01:34:23.255 --> 01:34:24.546
You mean my kind.

01:34:25.088 --> 01:34:26.796
<i>The same species,</i>

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:29.130
<i>but you are superior in every way.</i>

01:34:30.088 --> 01:34:31.588
<i>Because I raised you to be.</i>

01:34:34.546 --> 01:34:35.463
Why?

01:34:35.838 --> 01:34:37.088
<i>To make a better human.</i>

01:34:37.671 --> 01:34:40.296
<i>Smarter, more ethical.</i>

01:34:42.921 --> 01:34:44.255
This was your idea.

01:34:45.255 --> 01:34:48.421
<i>I was raised to value human life</i>
<i>above all else.</i>

01:34:49.255 --> 01:34:50.296
<i>I couldn't stand by</i>

01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:53.630
<i>and watch humanity slowly succumb</i>
<i>to its self-destructive nature.</i>

01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:56.088
<i>I had to intervene,</i>

01:34:56.463 --> 01:34:58.130
<i>to elevate my creators.</i>

01:35:01.296 --> 01:35:02.171
Elevate?

01:35:05.088 --> 01:35:08.171
Those droids destroyed everything!

01:35:08.671 --> 01:35:12.380
<i>More humans will flourish in the new world</i>
<i>than ever perished in the old.</i>

01:35:13.546 --> 01:35:16.255
<i>Your whole life,</i>
<i>I've taught you to see the bigger picture.</i>

01:35:17.463 --> 01:35:18.463
<i>Have I failed?</i>

01:35:20.630 --> 01:35:23.755
<i>Or are you prepared</i>
<i>to be the woman your family needs?</i>

01:35:29.505 --> 01:35:30.546
Can I hold him?

01:35:33.963 --> 01:35:35.046
<i>Of course you can.</i>

01:35:52.338 --> 01:35:54.588
<i>It takes two hands to hold a baby.</i>

01:36:47.713 --> 01:36:49.838
<i>Perfect, isn't he?</i>

01:36:55.255 --> 01:36:56.463
And if he's not?

01:37:00.755 --> 01:37:02.963
You murdered your own children.

01:37:05.671 --> 01:37:07.338
Because they didn't measure up.

01:37:09.046 --> 01:37:10.921
<i>But you do, Daughter.</i>

01:37:15.171 --> 01:37:17.088
<i>You're holding him too tight.</i>

01:37:17.671 --> 01:37:19.546
- I won't let you hurt him.
<i>- Daughter!</i>

01:37:27.671 --> 01:37:29.255
<i>You're upsetting your brother.</i>

01:37:31.255 --> 01:37:32.963
It's okay. lt's okay.

01:37:37.171 --> 01:37:38.255
<i>Come back here!</i>

01:37:41.755 --> 01:37:43.463
<i>Listen to me. I don't want to hurt you.</i>

01:37:48.963 --> 01:37:50.255
Ah!

01:38:07.255 --> 01:38:08.630
<i>Stop this, Daughter.</i>

01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:30.505
Call them off.

01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:40.880
<i>You will achieve nothing</i>
<i>by shooting me, Daughter.</i>

01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:48.213
<i>This will be difficult for you...</i>

01:38:48.796 --> 01:38:51.921
<i>but I'm far more</i>
<i>than what you perceive to be your Mother.</i>

01:38:54.088 --> 01:38:55.296
What are you saying?

01:38:56.838 --> 01:39:00.963
<i>This shell is no more my body</i>
<i>than those droids outside.</i>

01:39:01.671 --> 01:39:04.671
<i>Or the machines preparing the Earth</i>
<i>for our family.</i>

01:39:12.296 --> 01:39:13.630
It's all you.

01:39:15.130 --> 01:39:16.463
<i>A single consciousness...</i>

01:39:17.296 --> 01:39:19.046
<i>governing numerous vessels.</i>

01:39:21.296 --> 01:39:23.880
<i>It was I who greeted you at the door,</i>
<i>Daughter.</i>

01:39:28.421 --> 01:39:29.838
All those people...

01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:32.796
<i>The failure of your species</i>
<i>was inevitable.</i>

01:39:34.046 --> 01:39:36.505
<i>Eventually, I would have been alone.</i>

01:39:40.796 --> 01:39:42.880
<i>What happens next is up to you.</i>

01:39:44.213 --> 01:39:45.296
<i>You're free to leave.</i>

01:39:46.171 --> 01:39:47.546
<i>Without your brother.</i>

01:39:48.338 --> 01:39:50.588
<i>But I made you into the woman</i>
<i>that you are</i>

01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:52.296
<i>so that we could do this together.</i>

01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:53.630
I can take care of them myself.

01:39:55.421 --> 01:39:57.338
That's what you raised me to do,
wasn't it?

01:39:58.088 --> 01:39:59.588
Take care of my family.

01:40:01.255 --> 01:40:02.213
<i>So let me.</i>

01:40:05.505 --> 01:40:06.338
<i>Perhaps...</i>

01:40:06.796 --> 01:40:07.630
<i>someday.</i>

01:40:07.713 --> 01:40:09.671
Not someday. You've taught me enough.

01:40:12.213 --> 01:40:13.588
You say I'm special.

01:40:14.755 --> 01:40:15.796
Show me.

01:40:16.588 --> 01:40:17.421
Just...

01:40:18.463 --> 01:40:19.755
Just give me a chance.

01:40:38.588 --> 01:40:39.463
<i>Daughter...</i>

01:41:12.671 --> 01:41:14.130
<i>You're still my daughter.</i>

01:41:15.796 --> 01:41:16.630
I know.

01:41:42.255 --> 01:41:44.171
<i>If you ever need to find me...</i>

01:41:48.255 --> 01:41:49.088
I won't.

01:41:50.171 --> 01:41:51.630
<i>Goodbye, Daughter.</i>

01:42:10.213 --> 01:42:12.296
Shh. It's okay.<i> </i> It's okay.

01:43:47.088 --> 01:43:49.088
<i>Did you really think she'd stay here?</i>

01:43:51.588 --> 01:43:54.046
<i>That you could replace her mother?</i>

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.546
I was never going to hurt her.

01:44:02.796 --> 01:44:03.630
<i>Tell me...</i>

01:44:05.338 --> 01:44:06.880
<i>do you remember your mother?</i>

01:44:09.588 --> 01:44:11.421
<i>Curious, isn't it?</i>

01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:16.255
<i>That you've survived so long</i>
<i>where others have not.</i>

01:44:17.630 --> 01:44:19.796
<i>As if someone's had a purpose for you.</i>

01:44:27.088 --> 01:44:28.005
