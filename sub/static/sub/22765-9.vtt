00:08.976 --> 00:10.772
Previously on Marvel's
Runaways...

00:10.773 --> 00:13.151
We can't fully revive
him without a sacrifice.

00:13.152 --> 00:15.907
-Is he gonna be okay? -That's
what we're all hoping for.

00:15.908 --> 00:17.953
Have you talked to your mom?
Does she have these same issues?

00:17.954 --> 00:21.042
Oh, I don't know, I'm adopted.
My parents died in a fire.

00:21.043 --> 00:23.506
The Hernandezes were good people.
They didn't deserve this.

00:23.507 --> 00:24.967
I saw her hand, Robert.

00:24.968 --> 00:26.679
She burned herself
on a frying pan.

00:26.680 --> 00:28.891
-Is that a fact?
-Tina didn't do this.

00:28.892 --> 00:31.271
Your parents sent me this
just before they died.

00:31.272 --> 00:34.736
There's a Metrolink. We'll go down
there in the morning if you like.

00:34.737 --> 00:37.324
Are you kind of into Nico?
By the way, I would totally support it.

00:37.325 --> 00:40.372
-Yeah, so you could be with Chase?
-No, I don't like Chase.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.836
-Could've fooled me. -You're not being
honest about who you really like.

00:42.837 --> 00:44.798
Neither are you.
Do you know what they do?

00:44.799 --> 00:47.219
PRIDE? They raise money
for charity, honey,

00:47.220 --> 00:49.432
-that school they're building.
-No, Dad, that is not it.

00:49.433 --> 00:50.602
That is not it at all.

00:50.603 --> 00:52.856
Then tell me what it is.

00:52.857 --> 00:55.277
You can't keep the circumstances
of my sister's suicide a secret.

00:55.278 --> 00:57.406
Well, if Amy
was digging into Wizard,

00:57.407 --> 01:01.164
maybe your mom was worried that she
found something out about PRIDE.

01:01.165 --> 01:03.544
Her laptop was wiped clean,
but we never found her phone.

01:03.545 --> 01:06.675
I need to search
her room again.

01:06.676 --> 01:09.681
Got it all right here, all the proof
we need to put them away forever.

01:09.682 --> 01:11.769
If something happens to PRIDE,
my dad dies.

01:11.770 --> 01:13.773
This video can't get out.
Give me the laptop!

01:13.774 --> 01:15.568
-It's not up to you.
-Hey! Shit!

01:15.569 --> 01:17.572
No, no, no! Chase, don't!

01:17.573 --> 01:20.077
-Chase!
-What's wrong with you?

01:21.622 --> 01:22.957
I'm sorry.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:43.248 --> 01:44.166
Hey.

01:46.003 --> 01:47.924
Elian's gonna love
his new home, you know that?

01:49.928 --> 01:51.472
I love you.

01:51.473 --> 01:52.892
Incoming Wiz Chat.

01:57.234 --> 01:59.573
Oh, thank God. We've been
trying to reach you all night.

01:59.574 --> 02:00.783
-We saw.
-What's going on?

02:00.784 --> 02:01.785
-Everything okay?
-No.

02:01.786 --> 02:03.121
We got the new dig projections.

02:03.122 --> 02:04.415
Oh, great.
Email 'em over.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.127
No, you have to see
these in person.

02:06.128 --> 02:08.841
-You worried about Tina again?
-Look...

02:08.842 --> 02:11.012
If they are, you think whispering's
going to help, seriously?

02:11.013 --> 02:12.891
It's not about
the risk assessment.

02:12.892 --> 02:15.395
We dug up these rock samples.

02:17.483 --> 02:20.238
- Yeah.
-We can't explain it.

02:20.239 --> 02:24.330
I think this dig has jack-shit
to do with renewable energy.

02:24.331 --> 02:26.334
Now, I want to know what this
asshole, Jonah, has us working on.

02:26.335 --> 02:28.338
Okay, you know what?
We will be right over.

02:28.339 --> 02:31.762
And, Al, whatever it is,
we will figure it out together.

02:31.763 --> 02:33.766
We will. Don't worry.

02:42.074 --> 02:43.577
-Alice?
-What?

02:51.760 --> 02:53.973
Open it.

03:04.786 --> 03:07.667
Oh, my God!

03:07.668 --> 03:08.836
What is that?

03:12.886 --> 03:14.263
Molly!

03:44.658 --> 03:45.785
Hello?

03:45.786 --> 03:46.703
It's done.

03:48.414 --> 03:50.628
Gene and Alice are
no longer a problem.

03:50.629 --> 03:51.672
You mean...

03:53.049 --> 03:54.093
I handled it.

04:01.232 --> 04:02.150
Shit!

05:49.824 --> 05:51.786
Molly, sweetie, I made huevos.

05:54.041 --> 05:54.959
Jeez.

06:05.104 --> 06:08.946
Hey. Lookin' for something?

06:08.947 --> 06:10.490
Just tights.

06:11.701 --> 06:13.496
So, you're back?

06:13.497 --> 06:16.293
I-I know, it's strange,
me being home.

06:17.755 --> 06:20.134
Your mom's giving me a second
chance.

06:20.135 --> 06:24.059
I'm grateful, even if she doesn't
want me back in her bed yet.

06:24.060 --> 06:25.854
You do realize
we have a guest room.

06:25.855 --> 06:29.612
Maybe it's weird,
but it gives me comfort...

06:31.198 --> 06:32.618
being in here.

06:35.916 --> 06:37.460
You don't mind, do you?

06:37.461 --> 06:38.922
No.

06:40.425 --> 06:41.594
I get it.

06:59.630 --> 07:01.551
So, all of the data
got destroyed

07:01.552 --> 07:02.887
when Chase smashed
the computer?

07:02.888 --> 07:05.475
Yeah. Alex had no time
to back it up.

07:05.476 --> 07:09.441
I've never seen him so mad, but
now we're back to square one.

07:09.442 --> 07:10.819
No evidence.

07:10.820 --> 07:14.493
Listen, I think
it's really brave,

07:14.494 --> 07:15.871
what you guys have done,

07:15.872 --> 07:18.209
but I think it's time
that you step back,

07:18.210 --> 07:19.712
you let some adults
take over.

07:19.713 --> 07:21.423
One adult.

07:23.637 --> 07:24.972
Me.

07:27.143 --> 07:29.481
Dad, I appreciate you
letting me confide in you,

07:29.482 --> 07:31.569
but what can you really do
about all of this?

07:31.570 --> 07:32.822
Just give me a couple days.

07:32.823 --> 07:34.157
But I don't want
any of you kids

07:34.158 --> 07:35.536
taking this any further.

07:35.537 --> 07:37.080
If you're right
about all this--

07:37.081 --> 07:38.040
If?

07:38.041 --> 07:39.961
Then it's too dangerous

07:39.962 --> 07:41.130
for you
to do this on your own.

07:41.131 --> 07:42.508
Frank?

07:42.509 --> 07:44.261
I promise you, I got this.

07:45.973 --> 07:47.560
There you are.
Didn't you hear me?

07:47.561 --> 07:49.271
Yeah, I was just saying
goodbye to Karolina.

07:49.272 --> 07:50.899
Later, Gator!

07:50.900 --> 07:53.237
Gotta go, Buffalo!
-

07:55.116 --> 07:57.120
-Bye, honey.
-Bye, Mom.

07:59.207 --> 08:02.631
This type of tumor
is particularly aggressive

08:02.632 --> 08:06.346
and will require both surgery
and chemotherapy,

08:06.347 --> 08:08.100
but anyone who knows my husband

08:08.101 --> 08:10.354
knows he won't stop until he
succeeds.

08:10.355 --> 08:13.612
Unfortunately, the radical
therapy that he's pursuing

08:13.613 --> 08:15.532
is only available overseas,

08:15.533 --> 08:17.953
so he will retire
from public life

08:17.954 --> 08:20.667
while undergoing this process.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.003
Our family ask for privacy...

08:22.004 --> 08:24.299
Does my voice
really sound like that?

08:24.300 --> 08:26.721
When you lie, yeah, it does.

08:26.722 --> 08:28.432
Where is he?

08:28.433 --> 08:31.188
-What is happening with Dad?
-They took him.

08:31.189 --> 08:34.068
-Oh, so he could be dead?
-I don't think so.

08:34.070 --> 08:36.030
The man who's
taking care of him

08:36.032 --> 08:37.826
is very invested
in his recovery.

08:37.827 --> 08:40.916
Jonah? What the hell
is that guy's story?

08:44.214 --> 08:47.136
Chase, I know that this
is the most difficult thing

08:47.137 --> 08:48.765
that you have
ever been through,

08:48.766 --> 08:50.142
but I am begging you,

08:50.143 --> 08:51.854
do not ask questions.

08:51.855 --> 08:53.357
The less you know,
the better,

08:53.358 --> 08:56.531
about Jonah, about PRIDE,
about your father.

08:56.532 --> 08:59.537
Just do not rock the
boat in any way.

08:59.538 --> 09:01.039
Making waves
is only gonna--

09:01.040 --> 09:02.960
Put Dad in jeopardy,
I get it.

09:04.672 --> 09:07.803
I was gonna say...

09:07.804 --> 09:10.099
put you in harm's way.

09:10.100 --> 09:13.898
Losing my husband,
I could survive.

09:13.899 --> 09:18.533
But losing my son,
I could not.

09:18.534 --> 09:20.369
What? You're actually worried
that I might die?

09:23.208 --> 09:25.046
Who are these people,
really?

09:25.047 --> 09:27.258
They're no one
you need to worry about

09:27.259 --> 09:28.678
if you just listen to me.

09:28.679 --> 09:30.557
Okay, but Mom,
how did we get here?

09:31.684 --> 09:32.895
How do we make it stop?

09:32.896 --> 09:33.980
I wish I knew.

09:33.981 --> 09:36.193
But I need you
to be careful.

09:37.863 --> 09:41.161
Can you just promise me,
just please be careful?

09:44.292 --> 09:45.169
Okay.

09:52.350 --> 09:54.354
Chase!

09:54.355 --> 09:56.274
We heard the awful news
about your father.

09:56.275 --> 09:58.738
The whole school has your
family in our thoughts.

09:58.739 --> 10:00.241
He's a great man.

10:00.242 --> 10:01.326
Thanks, Ms. T.

10:01.327 --> 10:03.163
He's a fighter,
all right.

10:04.457 --> 10:06.754
Hey! Chase. Chase.

10:06.755 --> 10:09.593
I'm really sorry
about your dad, man.

10:09.594 --> 10:10.846
I know we've all
been through a lot,

10:10.847 --> 10:13.935
but, uh, your dad's
the shit, so...

10:13.936 --> 10:16.231
-Yeah, man, hey, we're rooting
for you, buddy. -For real.

10:16.232 --> 10:18.318
Wow. Thanks, guys.

10:18.319 --> 10:19.237
Bro hug?

10:22.661 --> 10:25.542
Got all these people
feeling sorry for him.

10:25.543 --> 10:28.590
Doesn't need a hug; what he
needs is a punch in the face.

10:28.591 --> 10:30.217
Another reason
to miss Molly.

10:30.218 --> 10:31.428
His dad is
in rough shape,

10:31.429 --> 10:33.348
wherever PRIDE
has him.

10:33.349 --> 10:35.394
His dad is just as bad
as the rest of our parents.

10:35.395 --> 10:36.396
And Chase destroyed
the only chance

10:36.397 --> 10:37.398
we had to
put 'em away.

10:37.399 --> 10:38.777
It still might
work out.

10:38.778 --> 10:40.655
I'm not saying what
he did was right--

10:40.656 --> 10:42.158
Please do not try
and defend him.

10:42.159 --> 10:43.703
Even if you did
hook up with him.

10:43.704 --> 10:45.624
Could you please
not tell everyone that?

10:45.625 --> 10:47.210
What, like Nico
hasn't already told them?

10:47.211 --> 10:48.378
How would Nico know
unless you told her?

10:48.379 --> 10:50.007
Why would it
bother you if I did?

10:50.008 --> 10:51.134
Yeah, no worries,
right now

10:51.135 --> 10:52.136
Nico isn't even
talking to me.

10:52.137 --> 10:53.347
He speaks the truth.

10:54.892 --> 10:56.687
And I'm leaving.

10:56.688 --> 10:59.527
-Stay. Let's talk through this.
-I've got a busted laptop

10:59.528 --> 11:01.404
that says we're past the point
of polite conversation.

11:01.405 --> 11:03.075
Wilder, I said
I was sorry.

11:03.076 --> 11:04.662
Are you sorry, Chase?

11:04.663 --> 11:06.666
Tell me, what does
that change, exactly?

11:06.667 --> 11:08.711
Thanks to you, we don't know
what our next move is,

11:08.712 --> 11:10.005
or if we even have one.

11:10.006 --> 11:11.424
We can't win,
not anymore.

11:11.425 --> 11:13.136
My dad says
he has a plan.

11:14.557 --> 11:16.309
So, what
are you suggesting?

11:16.310 --> 11:18.815
That we all break up?

11:18.816 --> 11:20.067
Again?

11:20.068 --> 11:22.280
No. No, we can't
disband the group.

11:22.281 --> 11:24.535
We never even gave ourselves
a cool nickname.

11:26.329 --> 11:28.292
How about the Runaways?

11:28.293 --> 11:32.300
For all the kids
we couldn't save or avenge.

11:33.468 --> 11:35.807
-Too dark.
-Even for me.

11:35.808 --> 11:37.561
Why don't we just go
nickname-less?

11:42.486 --> 11:45.577
Last chance to get your tickets
before the dance tonight!

11:45.578 --> 11:48.415
I'm sorry, this does
not concern you.

11:50.587 --> 11:54.260
Chase, I'm so sorry
to hear about your dad.

11:54.261 --> 11:56.974
You know, sometimes
a bad thing has to happen

11:56.975 --> 11:58.895
for something good
to come of it.

11:58.896 --> 12:02.443
How about a free ticket?

12:02.444 --> 12:03.821
I'll even save you a dance.

12:03.822 --> 12:06.451
Um, I'm not sure
I'm going.

12:08.038 --> 12:10.000
You want one?

12:10.001 --> 12:11.712
The water polo team
will be there,

12:11.713 --> 12:13.675
in case you're looking to
diversify.

12:16.429 --> 12:18.768
We'll take five tickets,
you hateful bitch.

12:20.855 --> 12:23.360
We're all going together.

12:23.361 --> 12:25.239
If there's nothing
left for us to do,

12:25.240 --> 12:26.491
then let's dance.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.836
Why are you smiling?

12:31.837 --> 12:34.048
'Cause it's finally over,

12:34.049 --> 12:37.681
the grip PRIDE had on our lives
for the last 15 years.

12:37.682 --> 12:39.518
I hope you're right.

12:39.519 --> 12:43.191
When that drill starts up, we'll
finally get our lives back.

12:44.820 --> 12:45.739
Our family...

12:48.619 --> 12:49.580
our marriage.

12:51.166 --> 12:52.836
What we've lost...

12:54.798 --> 12:56.594
we're never getting back.

13:09.953 --> 13:12.208
Hey, Amy,
Mommy's home.

13:12.209 --> 13:13.753
Hi, Mommy!

13:13.754 --> 13:15.507
What did you do to the
babysitter?

13:17.594 --> 13:19.180
Oh, that's for me?
Thank you.

13:19.181 --> 13:20.600
I thought you were sick.

13:20.601 --> 13:22.478
Oh, feeling
much better,

13:22.479 --> 13:23.898
thanks to
all of you.

13:23.899 --> 13:26.486
But mostly to you.

13:26.487 --> 13:27.697
What did I do
to deserve

13:27.698 --> 13:30.035
such gratitude
personally delivered?

13:30.036 --> 13:32.081
Keeping the recording
on your server,

13:32.082 --> 13:33.626
standing up
to the others.

13:33.627 --> 13:37.383
I believed in you,
and you believed in me.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.761
All I believed

13:38.762 --> 13:40.932
is that you would
make good on your threats.

13:40.933 --> 13:43.436
Hmm.
Come here, sweetie.

13:43.437 --> 13:46.986
Fascinating what you can learn
watching a child at play.

13:46.987 --> 13:49.825
Hmm! She is a smart one,
this one,

13:49.826 --> 13:51.286
just like her mom.

13:51.287 --> 13:53.456
Does the right thing.

13:53.457 --> 13:54.668
You're so lucky.

13:56.379 --> 13:58.968
A what a lovely family
you have.

13:58.969 --> 14:03.476
Come here, baby.
Hi, oh...

14:03.477 --> 14:06.441
They say that raising girls
at this age is easier,

14:06.442 --> 14:09.740
but when they become teenagers,
watch out.

14:09.741 --> 14:12.537
That's when they
turn on their mothers.

14:16.587 --> 14:18.173
Hey, you okay?

14:18.174 --> 14:20.010
Yes, you are.

14:45.060 --> 14:47.439
-Ready?
-Almost.

14:47.440 --> 14:51.364
You realize we're standing
at the edge of history?

14:51.365 --> 14:54.621
Step on up and witness a great
leap forward for humanity,

14:54.622 --> 14:56.374
all because of PRIDE.

14:56.375 --> 14:58.336
-Where are all my guys?
-I've dismissed them.

14:58.337 --> 15:00.758
We're gonna need a different level
of security moving forward.

15:00.759 --> 15:03.304
And Leslie's church
can provide that?

15:03.305 --> 15:06.645
This is my neighborhood,
my site.

15:06.646 --> 15:08.398
And you have my word
it will be protected,

15:08.399 --> 15:10.068
but this elite group
of men and women

15:10.069 --> 15:12.406
are far more dedicated
than your average wage drone.

15:12.407 --> 15:15.078
-Hey, my guys are not--
-I, for one, am just glad

15:15.079 --> 15:17.625
- -this day is finally here.
- - Agreed.

15:17.626 --> 15:20.590
Look, this renewable energy source
you've been talking about for so long,

15:20.591 --> 15:23.094
I think maybe now it's time
for a few more specifics.

15:23.095 --> 15:25.474
We've all sacrificed
a great deal to get here.

15:25.475 --> 15:27.186
Some details would be nice.

15:27.187 --> 15:29.398
Please, huh?

15:29.399 --> 15:32.947
Let's not get distracted
from this joyous occasion.

15:32.948 --> 15:35.578
Everything we've worked for
has finally come to fruition.

15:35.579 --> 15:37.707
He never really answers a question.
You ever notice that?

15:44.971 --> 15:46.015
You ready?

15:54.406 --> 15:55.492
Oh, my...

16:00.920 --> 16:02.172
Wow.

16:22.755 --> 16:24.049
You gotta be kidding me.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.343
Hurry up, man,
get in the car.

16:28.266 --> 16:29.811
So, what's going on?

16:29.812 --> 16:32.149
I'm paying you to be my
eyes and ears in there.

16:32.150 --> 16:33.777
What, you get a splinter
or some shit?

16:33.778 --> 16:35.030
Got fired. We all did.

16:38.119 --> 16:39.831
Huh.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.835
Okay, almost 20 years
I've been waiting to see

16:41.836 --> 16:43.964
what the hell old G's
gonna do with this shit.

16:45.635 --> 16:47.471
I guess it's finally on.

16:49.308 --> 16:50.393
Gert!

16:50.394 --> 16:51.563
Molly?

16:54.193 --> 16:56.030
-Oh, my God, are you alone?
-How's your new house?

16:56.031 --> 16:57.742
-How did you get here? -You
missed some real shit last night.

16:57.743 --> 16:59.453
-What are you doing here?
-Listen, Graciela's probably

16:59.454 --> 17:00.539
already calling around
looking for me.

17:00.540 --> 17:02.292
I don't have a lot of time.

17:02.293 --> 17:04.338
Which is why you decided to do
a show-and-tell on retrotech.

17:04.339 --> 17:06.133
It's from my parents,
and I need you to help me.

17:06.134 --> 17:07.762
Okay, well, uh,
when I was in AV club,

17:07.762 --> 17:09.348
we had an old
VHS machine

17:09.348 --> 17:11.520
that we used to stash
in the closet of the library.

17:11.521 --> 17:12.814
Maybe it's still there.

17:15.109 --> 17:16.319
What? It used
to be a cool club.

17:16.320 --> 17:17.781
-No, yeah.
-Definitely.

17:17.782 --> 17:18.826
It's literally the club

17:18.827 --> 17:19.868
they use in every teen movie

17:19.869 --> 17:21.454
to show how uncool someone is.

17:21.455 --> 17:23.459
Guys, come on, don't
take away his one thing.

17:24.503 --> 17:25.422
You're all assholes.

17:33.021 --> 17:35.610
This was left
specifically for me,

17:35.611 --> 17:36.612
something important.

17:40.035 --> 17:42.289
Hi, baby.

17:42.290 --> 17:44.376
-Molly, those are your...
-Yeah.

17:44.377 --> 17:46.255
Molly, since
before you were born,

17:46.256 --> 17:48.510
we've been part of an
organization called PRIDE.

17:48.511 --> 17:50.681
PRIDE does a lot of good
for the city,

17:50.682 --> 17:53.186
but it's not the group's
reason for being.

17:53.187 --> 17:54.773
They're planning on
digging something up,

17:54.774 --> 17:57.319
something buried deep
beneath the city.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.239
We were told

17:59.240 --> 18:01.662
that it was
a renewable energy source,

18:01.663 --> 18:03.456
that would do good
for the planet.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.001
But now
we're not so sure.

18:05.002 --> 18:06.588
Doesn't sound like this story
has a happy ending.

18:06.589 --> 18:08.216
-And you're surprised?
-Shh.

18:08.217 --> 18:10.554
And even if what's
down there is good...

18:10.555 --> 18:13.894
There's a blind fault
you can't see from the surface,

18:13.895 --> 18:17.777
and if we disturb it, it will
cause a series of seismic events.

18:17.778 --> 18:19.656
Catastrophic earthquakes.

18:19.657 --> 18:22.620
Hydrocarbons causing
explosions and massive fires.

18:22.621 --> 18:24.164
Not to mention we found

18:24.165 --> 18:26.962
some really weird stuff
in these rock samples,

18:26.963 --> 18:30.218
and we don't know if it's caused
by a virus or a fungus...

18:30.219 --> 18:32.347
It doesn't--
it doesn't matter.

18:32.348 --> 18:35.437
The point is, if you're watching
this, we failed to stop it.

18:39.612 --> 18:42.827
Baby, we love you
so, so much...

18:46.626 --> 18:48.672
and there's so much more
we wanna tell you.

18:51.385 --> 18:56.395
But please know that
we are right beside you...

18:56.396 --> 18:58.065
always.

18:58.066 --> 19:00.780
You are our greatest joy.

19:02.407 --> 19:04.746
And we are
so, so sorry.

19:16.937 --> 19:18.774
This-- this makes zero sense.

19:18.775 --> 19:20.068
Maybe our parents don't
know what that dig will do.

19:20.069 --> 19:21.738
Come on,
of course they do.

19:21.739 --> 19:24.994
They just went from serial
killers to genocidal maniacs.

19:24.995 --> 19:27.082
I was hoping my parents
weren't a part of this,

19:27.083 --> 19:29.671
but I guess they're
as bad as the rest.

19:29.672 --> 19:32.635
No, your parents thought that
they were doing something good,

19:32.636 --> 19:35.181
and when they realized they
weren't, they tried to warn you.

19:35.182 --> 19:36.768
Maybe they tried
to warn the others.

19:36.769 --> 19:40.233
Maybe that's why...
they died.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.868
Forget turning our parents in.
We have to stop them.

19:44.869 --> 19:46.203
Stop them
from what?

19:46.204 --> 19:49.418
What are they even doing,
digging a hole?

19:51.380 --> 19:53.009
The school.

19:53.010 --> 19:55.556
They're using its
construction as a cover.

19:55.557 --> 19:58.770
The PRIDE meetings, the gala?
It's all been a front.

19:58.771 --> 20:00.273
Basically our whole lives,

20:00.274 --> 20:01.902
they've been planning on
how to end the world.

20:01.903 --> 20:03.864
Getting rid of anyone
who stood in their way.

20:03.865 --> 20:06.368
Which could include us next.

20:06.369 --> 20:08.331
Anyone interested
in doing a semester abroad?

20:08.332 --> 20:09.751
Oh, so you're cool
with letting California

20:09.752 --> 20:11.211
just drop
into the Pacific?

20:11.212 --> 20:13.424
Exploding hydrogen!
Mutant fungus!

20:13.425 --> 20:15.178
No, I-- but--

20:15.179 --> 20:17.432
Maybe we should just
slow down and ask for some help.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.938
Things are always changing.
It has been ten years.

20:19.939 --> 20:21.148
What if nothing's changed?

20:21.149 --> 20:25.198
Alex is right.
We have to do something.

20:25.199 --> 20:27.703
Maybe we're in
way over our heads,

20:27.704 --> 20:31.503
but I think
our parents are, too.

20:31.504 --> 20:33.255
Mine definitely are.

20:33.256 --> 20:36.303
As much as it pains me
to say it,

20:36.304 --> 20:38.684
Chase is also right.

20:38.685 --> 20:40.938
We have to stop this.
No one else will.

20:40.939 --> 20:42.858
I guess that means
we're not going to the dance.

20:42.859 --> 20:44.946
Probably would've had
a better chance at a refund

20:44.947 --> 20:46.992
if I hadn't called Eiffel
a hateful bitch.

20:46.993 --> 20:49.496
Oh, no, the dance is still on.
It's the perfect cover.

20:49.497 --> 20:50.666
Then I regret nothing.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.503
Let's meet there tonight.

20:52.504 --> 20:53.672
Drive separately,

20:53.673 --> 20:57.262
dress nice,
lie to your parents. Good?

20:57.263 --> 20:58.305
-Yeah.
-Good.

21:04.944 --> 21:06.321
Frank.

21:06.322 --> 21:09.036
Jonah. Thank you for
agreeing to meet with me.

21:09.037 --> 21:11.248
Of course. What is it
you'd like to discuss?

21:11.249 --> 21:13.085
Taking a more active role
in the church,

21:13.086 --> 21:14.714
perhaps teaching
a few lessons?

21:14.715 --> 21:17.302
Jonah, they say
that knowledge is power,

21:17.303 --> 21:20.601
and if that's the case,
I'm feeling very powerful...

21:24.525 --> 21:27.615
because of the knowledge...

21:27.616 --> 21:30.119
that I have.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.958
I'm just connecting dots
for you.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.837
Thank you, Frank,
I'm managing to follow along.

21:34.838 --> 21:38.302
So, tell me,
what is it you know?

21:48.322 --> 21:50.159
Mom, what are you doing?

21:50.160 --> 21:52.455
There's no need to involve the
housekeeper in any of this.

21:52.456 --> 21:54.000
PRIDE doesn't have a cleaner?

21:54.001 --> 21:56.380
I thought every group
of shadeball criminals had one.

21:56.381 --> 22:00.597
I think my membership's been revoked
until your father's back on his feet.

22:00.598 --> 22:02.350
Turns out they didn't
appreciate me for me.

22:02.351 --> 22:04.939
And they seem like
such nice people otherwise.

22:06.734 --> 22:08.112
Look at you!

22:08.113 --> 22:11.493
Mom, if you want me
to stay and help, I will.

22:11.494 --> 22:15.001
No, it's good for you to go out and
do some normal teenager stuff.

22:15.002 --> 22:16.921
You wanna take a car?

22:16.922 --> 22:19.092
Take any one you want 'cause
your dad's not here to say no.

22:19.093 --> 22:20.554
You could take
the Leapfrog.

22:20.555 --> 22:22.098
I'm gonna take a Lyft,

22:22.099 --> 22:23.894
but I just wanted to say...

22:25.856 --> 22:27.902
goodbye.

22:27.903 --> 22:30.156
You didn't even tell me
who you're taking as your date.

22:30.157 --> 22:32.661
Eiffel or Karolina?

22:32.662 --> 22:34.540
I know you guys have been
spending a lot of time together.

22:34.541 --> 22:36.084
And the more time
I spend with her,

22:36.085 --> 22:38.214
the less I think she wants
to spend with me.

22:38.215 --> 22:39.634
Sorry.

22:39.635 --> 22:40.719
No, doesn't matter.

22:40.720 --> 22:42.388
Dates are so heteronormative.

22:42.389 --> 22:44.059
Really, since when?

22:44.060 --> 22:45.228
-That's what Gert says.
-Ahh.

22:45.229 --> 22:46.981
Most of the time,

22:46.982 --> 22:49.402
I don't even know what the
hell she's talking about.

22:49.403 --> 22:51.448
Apparently there are
a lot of ways to offend someone,

22:51.449 --> 22:55.540
but once in a while,
she does make a good point.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.713
Well, you go have fun.

22:58.714 --> 23:00.676
Hey. Bye.

23:25.391 --> 23:26.476
Hello?

23:26.477 --> 23:27.395
It's me.

23:29.817 --> 23:33.449
"He found out.
Leave the house now."

23:33.450 --> 23:36.496
So, at least two other people
knew that Amy was in danger.

23:36.497 --> 23:38.500
-Whoever warned her--
-And whoever killed her.

23:38.501 --> 23:40.212
God, and all this time
we blamed ourselves.

23:40.213 --> 23:42.342
And it was never suicide.
Someone did this.

23:46.851 --> 23:51.109
The message says "he," so at least
we know it wasn't your mom.

23:51.110 --> 23:53.531
...if that's what you were
thinking, not that I was.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.163
What about your dad?

23:57.164 --> 24:00.419
Kincaid? He knew Amy
was hacking Wizard.

24:00.420 --> 24:03.217
If he's not the one who found
out, maybe he sent the text.

24:03.218 --> 24:04.845
No, she has him
in her contacts.

24:04.846 --> 24:06.516
This is from
an unknown number.

24:06.517 --> 24:09.772
Do you think that maybe Amy
reached out to someone in PRIDE,

24:09.773 --> 24:12.402
like one of the parents?

24:12.403 --> 24:14.907
You guys are
gonna be late!

24:14.908 --> 24:17.412
Your mom and I wanna take
a couple pictures before you go!

24:17.413 --> 24:18.581
Yeah, pictures would be great.

24:18.582 --> 24:21.253
You do look
really, really nice.

24:21.254 --> 24:23.132
Ooh...

24:25.720 --> 24:27.975
Aw, you think I look nice?

24:27.976 --> 24:30.647
I think you look great.

24:30.648 --> 24:32.358
Too bad I don't
give a shit anymore.

24:32.359 --> 24:33.987
This is just our cover.

24:33.988 --> 24:35.615
Nico, you know
how sorry I am.

24:35.616 --> 24:37.744
And yet not nearly
as sorry as I am.

24:41.836 --> 24:43.548
This doesn't change anything.

24:51.104 --> 24:53.610
Hi, Graciela,
it's Dale and Stacey!

24:53.611 --> 24:55.947
We knew Molly would be home
from school by now,

24:55.948 --> 24:57.241
and we are just missing her.

24:57.242 --> 24:58.828
I'm sorry,
but Molly's not here.

24:58.829 --> 25:01.626
Is she out
with a friend?

25:01.627 --> 25:03.462
Because she's
already so popular?

25:03.463 --> 25:05.424
Don't be ridiculous,
she's at dance practice,

25:05.425 --> 25:07.638
because she's already the star
of the squad, right?

25:07.639 --> 25:10.392
She's not here
because she left.

25:10.393 --> 25:13.023
Okay, uh, when?

25:13.024 --> 25:15.319
- -She was gone this morning.
-  - And you didn't call us?

25:15.320 --> 25:19.035
-We trusted you with her.
-Yes, but I don't trust you.

25:19.036 --> 25:21.541
That's absurd
and offensive.

25:21.542 --> 25:24.045
Gene and Alice obviously
didn't trust you, either,

25:24.046 --> 25:25.590
or they would've left
the key with you.

25:25.591 --> 25:27.260
-What key?
-I don't know.

25:27.261 --> 25:28.428
Look, I'm sorry,

25:28.429 --> 25:30.182
but leave that poor girl alone.

25:30.183 --> 25:31.644
She's been through enough.

25:36.571 --> 25:38.156
Well, remind me
never to leave

25:38.157 --> 25:40.244
any of our other children
in her care.

25:40.245 --> 25:42.373
Gene and Alice
didn't trust us?

25:42.374 --> 25:43.835
They loved us.

25:43.836 --> 25:45.421
They left us the ranch
because they wanted us

25:45.422 --> 25:46.966
to have someplace
to escape to.

25:46.967 --> 25:49.680
But they also knew that we
might become compromised,

25:49.681 --> 25:52.268
which we were.

25:52.269 --> 25:54.690
So I think it was
actually smart of them

25:54.691 --> 25:56.736
to leave something
with Graciela,

25:56.737 --> 25:58.740
something only for Molly.

25:58.741 --> 26:01.369
Smart? It means
they knew we'd fail.

26:01.370 --> 26:03.625
But it also means they knew
what we were up against,

26:03.626 --> 26:06.505
because they were up against
it too, and they also failed.

26:06.506 --> 26:11.306
The lab was destroyed in the fire.
Did anything survive?

26:13.811 --> 26:15.022
Unknown caller.

26:15.023 --> 26:17.401
-Answer it! It could be Molly!
-Hello.

26:17.402 --> 26:19.364
I do hope
I'm not interrupting.

26:19.365 --> 26:24.207
I'd like a group meeting,
my place. Now.

26:51.094 --> 26:52.514
How was Molly's Day Off,

26:52.515 --> 26:55.018
steal a sports car
or lead a parade?

26:55.019 --> 26:57.733
Pretty much.
I rode the trolley at the Grove,

26:57.734 --> 26:59.611
checked out the Tar Pits,

26:59.612 --> 27:01.949
grabbed a slice of razzleberry
pie at Marie Callendar's.

27:01.950 --> 27:02.993
Thanks for hooking me up.

27:04.287 --> 27:05.999
You brought her?!

27:06.000 --> 27:07.586
Figured we'd
need some backup

27:07.587 --> 27:09.255
if we're gonna
save the world tonight.

27:09.256 --> 27:12.219
I missed you, girl! Hi!

27:12.220 --> 27:13.765
Are we the
first ones here?

27:13.766 --> 27:15.727
Chase was in a while ago.

27:15.728 --> 27:17.981
He went inside,
and he left me with this.

27:17.982 --> 27:19.693
Maybe I'll give
the Fistigons a try.

27:19.694 --> 27:21.488
-Do not touch anything.
-Even the x-ray goggles?

27:21.489 --> 27:22.406
Especially those.

27:26.665 --> 27:29.462
Looks like the Lyft armada
has arrived.

27:34.096 --> 27:35.975
I think I'm gonna
look for Chase.

27:35.976 --> 27:38.104
You sure look pretty
for a mission.

27:38.105 --> 27:40.442
I had to keep
the cover story.

27:40.443 --> 27:42.363
I've never seen
that necklace or that dress.

27:42.364 --> 27:44.242
-Is it for him?
-No!

27:44.243 --> 27:46.120
Go get him.
Live your truth.

27:46.121 --> 27:48.166
-Aw, stop, just stop, please.
-

27:52.884 --> 27:54.011
Hi, girl.

27:57.978 --> 27:59.230
Go back.

28:37.682 --> 28:40.521
Can you believe we were
ever a part of this?

28:40.522 --> 28:42.024
I never really was.

28:42.025 --> 28:43.861
What do you mean?

28:43.862 --> 28:45.657
You wouldn't understand.

28:48.829 --> 28:51.125
No matter where you go,

28:51.126 --> 28:53.964
or what you do,
people see you.

28:53.965 --> 28:56.469
When someone like me
walks through a door,

28:56.470 --> 28:58.849
no one really
turns my way.

28:58.850 --> 29:02.691
Unless I just barfed
orange juice onto my shoes.

29:02.692 --> 29:04.903
-I remember that.
-That was one day.

29:07.534 --> 29:09.871
There were a hundred
when you didn't realize

29:09.872 --> 29:11.082
I was standing
right next to you.

29:12.167 --> 29:13.461
What do you care?

29:13.462 --> 29:14.548
You thought
I was an idiot.

29:17.302 --> 29:19.641
I never thought that.

29:19.642 --> 29:22.939
I may have said that
often and loudly,

29:22.940 --> 29:24.901
but it was
a defense mechanism...

29:26.446 --> 29:28.659
'cause I felt ignored.

29:36.215 --> 29:39.806
Looks like my
invisibility's contagious...

29:39.807 --> 29:41.727
and that Brandon
stole your life.

29:41.728 --> 29:43.898
He can have it.

29:43.899 --> 29:45.777
That life was bullshit.

29:48.031 --> 29:50.536
As messed up
as things are right now,

29:50.537 --> 29:52.206
at least
we know the truth,

29:52.207 --> 29:53.751
who our friends are,

29:53.752 --> 29:55.880
who our parents are.

29:55.881 --> 29:59.805
It might suck,
but it's real.

30:02.644 --> 30:05.190
I think the boy
just became a man.

30:05.191 --> 30:08.906
About time, I guess, since tonight
may be our last night on earth.

30:08.907 --> 30:10.450
Yeah.

30:12.412 --> 30:15.670
Well, if that's how it is,
I'd like one last dance.

30:26.107 --> 30:26.859
Whoa!

30:44.853 --> 30:46.815
I always saw you.

30:49.529 --> 30:51.115
I know you did.

31:31.738 --> 31:33.575
What is taking
them so long?

31:33.576 --> 31:35.955
-I'm gonna go look.
-Want some company?

31:35.956 --> 31:37.207
Sure.

31:37.208 --> 31:39.086
Karolina,
you wanna come?

31:39.087 --> 31:40.005
Mm-hmm.

31:45.056 --> 31:48.146
-Someone's in the dog house.
-Yep, I got it.

31:48.147 --> 31:49.064
I got it.

31:53.031 --> 31:54.283
No one down here.

31:54.284 --> 31:56.287
We must've missed them.

31:56.288 --> 31:59.293
-Let's head back?
-Wait, uh--

31:59.294 --> 32:00.336
Everything
all right?

32:22.840 --> 32:23.759
Whoa.

32:24.886 --> 32:27.140
Sorry.

32:27.141 --> 32:29.729
I've just wanted to do that
for a really long time,

32:29.730 --> 32:32.527
and after tonight,

32:32.528 --> 32:34.029
I didn't know if
I'd get the chance.

32:42.797 --> 32:43.882
We should go.

32:43.883 --> 32:44.801
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

32:55.823 --> 32:59.288
I'm not sure I understand the urgency
of bringing us together like this.

32:59.289 --> 33:03.421
In 1967, in New York City,
after weeks of unrest

33:03.422 --> 33:05.341
and rioting
caused by young people,

33:05.342 --> 33:07.262
the news began to run a phrase

33:07.263 --> 33:10.895
at the beginning of every
broadcast.

33:10.896 --> 33:16.615
"It's 10:00 pm. Do you know
where your children are?"

33:16.616 --> 33:18.201
-If this is another threat, we--
-It's not a threat.

33:18.202 --> 33:19.829
It's a legitimate question.

33:19.830 --> 33:21.541
They're at
a school dance.

33:21.542 --> 33:23.211
Yeah, Gert said
they went as a group.

33:23.212 --> 33:24.839
-And you believe them.
-Why wouldn't we?

33:24.840 --> 33:26.175
Because they're liars.

33:26.176 --> 33:28.054
They've been lying
to you for weeks.

33:28.055 --> 33:28.805
Molly.

33:31.185 --> 33:32.563
She knows.

33:32.564 --> 33:33.941
They all know.

33:33.942 --> 33:36.613
On the night
of the failed sacrifice,

33:36.614 --> 33:38.199
your children
witnessed everything.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.869
They attempted
to go to the police

33:39.870 --> 33:42.207
and discovered the involvement
of the good Detective Flores,

33:42.208 --> 33:45.506
so at the gala,
they hacked the Wizard server.

33:47.425 --> 33:50.014
-Oh, my God. -They've been
conspiring against you for weeks,

33:50.015 --> 33:51.726
and certain members
of our group--

33:51.727 --> 33:54.314
Yorkses and Wilders,
I'm talking to you--

33:54.315 --> 33:57.530
decided to protect Molly
by sending her away.

33:57.531 --> 33:59.408
-Why didn't you say something?
-Oh, why do you think?

33:59.409 --> 34:01.078
- -To keep this asshole from hurting her.
-  - Okay.

34:02.247 --> 34:03.875
How do you know
all this?

34:03.876 --> 34:06.380
Because one of you did the
right thing and came to me.

34:07.758 --> 34:09.261
Don't look at me.

34:09.262 --> 34:11.891
I'm not saying I
wouldn't, but I didn't.

34:11.891 --> 34:13.770
I didn't know.

34:13.771 --> 34:15.440
Neither did I.

34:17.820 --> 34:20.491
When Victor was dying
on the floor...

34:22.370 --> 34:24.123
I was not your first call.

34:26.337 --> 34:30.929
When you found out about Molly,
you did not alert me.

34:30.929 --> 34:33.391
When I handed you the serum
that cured Victor's brain tumor,

34:33.393 --> 34:34.978
it was not returned to me.

34:34.980 --> 34:38.194
I suspect it's undergoing
a battery of secret tests

34:38.195 --> 34:39.614
in your lab as we speak.

34:39.614 --> 34:41.074
-No...
-Yes.

34:47.630 --> 34:50.928
There are many difficult
decisions ahead of us.

34:50.929 --> 34:53.516
If you question
my leadership in any way,

34:53.518 --> 34:55.728
the consequences
shall be severe.

34:55.730 --> 34:58.777
So, let me ask you again.

34:59.862 --> 35:02.993
Where are your children?

35:15.728 --> 35:16.730
He took the gloves.

35:24.787 --> 35:26.666
The drawer with the gun
is still locked.

35:26.667 --> 35:27.877
Thank God.

35:27.878 --> 35:29.964
But he took a keycard
from my desk,

35:29.965 --> 35:32.051
the one for the PRIDE
construction site.

35:39.859 --> 35:42.531
-Ooh... -It's the third time already.
Everything okay?

35:42.532 --> 35:44.159
The baby's sitting
right on my bladder,

35:44.160 --> 35:46.790
so no,
everything's not okay.

35:46.791 --> 35:48.627
Why we gotta come here
all the time?

35:48.628 --> 35:50.296
We need to think about
eating healthy.

35:50.297 --> 35:52.968
You can eat wherever you want.
Nobody asked you.

35:52.969 --> 35:54.722
Well, it seems like
if I want to see you,

35:54.723 --> 35:57.185
I gotta look for
a Wilder construction sign.

35:57.186 --> 35:58.563
You got a real problem.

35:58.564 --> 36:00.526
Why can't you just
let go of all that shit?

36:00.527 --> 36:03.197
Because something's goin' on
here, somethin' big.

36:03.198 --> 36:04.826
You gonna get
yourself killed.

36:04.827 --> 36:06.370
You almost did already.

36:06.371 --> 36:09.836
And now Andre disappeared,
your whole crew busted up?

36:09.837 --> 36:11.338
I'm not raising
this kid alone.

36:11.339 --> 36:13.217
Listen, I saw
some shit, Tamar.

36:14.469 --> 36:16.014
A girl that glows.

36:16.015 --> 36:18.394
A little one that can
lift an SUV.

36:18.395 --> 36:21.108
This stick that... I really
don't even know what it did.

36:21.109 --> 36:25.826
And a glove that makes...
lightning.

36:27.621 --> 36:29.499
You said you were
off the drugs, D.

36:31.044 --> 36:32.965
This better not be
a crack baby.

36:32.966 --> 36:36.346
Geoffrey Wilder was always
one step ahead of everybody.

36:36.347 --> 36:37.850
Always.

36:37.851 --> 36:39.687
Now he's into
something new.

36:39.688 --> 36:41.273
I want to find out
what it is...

36:43.277 --> 36:45.364
and then I wanna
take it from him.

36:45.365 --> 36:50.751
So, I guess you're sleeping
in your car again tonight?

36:50.752 --> 36:52.086
I won't be sleeping.

36:52.087 --> 36:53.715
I'll see you
when I see you.

36:53.716 --> 36:57.640
I'm going to
Steak 'n' Shake.

37:13.170 --> 37:15.299
All right, everyone double-check
that your phone's off

37:15.300 --> 37:17.136
so our parents can't find us
using WizKidTracker.

37:17.137 --> 37:18.556
The invention
of which we can add

37:18.557 --> 37:20.393
to the long list of evil things
my mom has done.

37:20.394 --> 37:22.397
We're a long way
from Brentwood.

37:22.398 --> 37:24.819
Hey, it's okay,
we got this.

37:24.820 --> 37:26.531
-Chase, Fistigons?
-Got 'em.

37:26.532 --> 37:28.367
-Staff?
-Done.

37:28.368 --> 37:29.704
-How do you feel?
-Ready.

37:29.705 --> 37:31.666
-Molly?
-I'm so good.

37:31.667 --> 37:34.421
-What about my secret weapon?
-Um, she stays in the car.

37:34.422 --> 37:36.299
-For now.
-Crack the windows, though.

37:36.300 --> 37:38.596
This is LA. If anybody sees
an animal in the car,

37:38.597 --> 37:40.976
they'll call the cops,
even if it is a dinosaur.

37:40.977 --> 37:43.439
And what are you bringing
to the party, Alex?

37:43.440 --> 37:46.319
Access.
Stolen from my dad.

37:46.320 --> 37:49.869
Now, once we get in there,
we destroy as much as we can

37:49.870 --> 37:51.789
as fast as we can,
then we get out.

37:51.790 --> 37:54.419
All right, I'm sure
that there's plenty of security.

37:54.420 --> 37:55.672
Gonna need
some help with that.

37:55.673 --> 37:57.341
Best case scenario,

37:57.342 --> 37:59.220
we don't get caught,
we don't have to fight.

37:59.221 --> 38:01.349
When was the last time any of us
experienced a best case scenario?

38:03.103 --> 38:05.734
Look, I know that it's been
a shitty couple of weeks.

38:05.735 --> 38:09.491
-Understatement.
-But we're friends again,

38:09.492 --> 38:13.541
and I didn't think
we ever would be.

38:13.542 --> 38:15.127
I wouldn't wanna save the
world with any other crew.

38:18.300 --> 38:19.637
Let's go.

38:22.935 --> 38:25.732
Hey, excuse me!
Stop right there!

38:25.733 --> 38:29.615
Um, hi, I'm Alex. I think you, uh,
know my dad, Geoffrey Wilder.

38:29.616 --> 38:31.034
This, uh, is his site.

38:31.035 --> 38:33.957
Wilder Construction's
not in charge anymore.

38:33.958 --> 38:36.461
This site's being run
by the Church of Gibborim now.

38:36.462 --> 38:40.136
Oh, maybe you should call my dad
and have him authorize it.

38:40.137 --> 38:42.140
- - Oh.
- - Oh ho!

38:42.141 --> 38:43.768
We have a school
photography project.

38:43.769 --> 38:45.187
He said it would be okay.

38:45.188 --> 38:46.732
Now this just got interesting.

38:46.733 --> 38:48.402
Karolina, uh, Miss Dean.

38:48.403 --> 38:49.738
This is a nice surprise.

38:49.739 --> 38:51.576
-What's your name?
-Carl.

38:51.577 --> 38:53.830
Ah, well, it is a pleasure
to meet you, Carl,

38:53.831 --> 38:55.249
but if you could just hurry,

38:55.250 --> 38:57.336
- -we have a lot of work to do.
- - Yeah.

38:57.337 --> 38:59.257
Waited to the
last minute, huh?

38:59.258 --> 39:00.927
- -I was like that.
- - Mm-hmm.

39:00.928 --> 39:02.723
Do you need his number?

39:02.724 --> 39:03.641
No, I have it.

39:09.820 --> 39:11.991
-This is Frank.
-Hate to bother you, Mr. Dean,

39:11.992 --> 39:14.120
but this is Carl
down at the construction site.

39:14.121 --> 39:16.249
Your daughter is here,

39:16.250 --> 39:18.546
and she said something
about a school project?

39:18.547 --> 39:20.424
Wants to get into the site.

39:20.425 --> 39:21.886
I'm sure it's okay,

39:21.887 --> 39:24.224
but, uh, I just felt like
I should check.

39:24.225 --> 39:26.478
She has a bunch of friends
with her.

39:26.479 --> 39:28.023
I really appreciate you
calling, Carl.

39:28.024 --> 39:29.484
I should've let you
know in advance,

39:29.485 --> 39:31.488
but the day just...
got away from me a little bit.

39:31.489 --> 39:34.118
Please just let her
and her friends on the site

39:34.119 --> 39:35.872
and facilitate
whatever they need.

39:35.873 --> 39:41.842
-Happy to do it.
-Thanks, Carl. You're the best.

39:41.843 --> 39:44.682
I think the church is
going to thrive

39:44.683 --> 39:46.519
under your leadership,
Frank.

39:53.616 --> 39:55.996
You're good. Let's go.

40:10.024 --> 40:11.944
Whoa.

40:11.945 --> 40:14.407
This is gonna be tougher
than I thought.

40:15.660 --> 40:17.539
One step at a time.

40:17.540 --> 40:20.377
Let's find a way
to shut this down for good.

40:20.378 --> 40:23.383
My dad created this thing.
Maybe I can find the controls.

40:23.384 --> 40:25.930
Molly, Karolina, let's see if we
can move one of these trucks.

40:25.931 --> 40:29.897
- To where?
-There!

40:29.898 --> 40:32.944
I'll keep watch, shield you guys
if something goes wrong.

40:32.945 --> 40:34.280
Let's go.

40:37.579 --> 40:38.539
Over here!

40:45.929 --> 40:47.431
What is this,
an on-off switch?

40:47.432 --> 40:48.851
'Cause that's about all
you could manage.

40:50.772 --> 40:53.402
Are you mad at me about
what happened between us?

40:53.403 --> 40:56.742
What, that we had sex in the
middle of the Tennenbaum wedding

40:56.743 --> 41:00.374
and didn't even stop to talk about
it or define the relationship?

41:00.375 --> 41:01.544
That was an hour ago,

41:01.545 --> 41:02.838
and now we're
trying to prevent

41:02.839 --> 41:04.550
California from dropping
into the ocean!

41:06.302 --> 41:08.098
I'm not saying what happened
wasn't also important--

41:08.099 --> 41:11.522
It wasn't. It-- if it
was just a one-time thing.

41:12.732 --> 41:13.693
It was?

41:15.947 --> 41:17.241
Of course.

41:17.242 --> 41:20.122
It was hormones.
We're teenagers,

41:20.123 --> 41:23.963
driven by biological imperative
to propagate the species.

41:23.964 --> 41:25.842
Okay, well, I'm not sure
what you just said,

41:25.843 --> 41:27.679
but, come on, let's just
focus on the mission.

41:29.703 --> 41:30.717
Fine.

41:35.778 --> 41:37.198
-
- Come on, Molly!

41:37.199 --> 41:39.243
Aw, this thing
isn't recognizing me.

41:39.244 --> 41:41.206
It must only be
for authorized users.

41:41.207 --> 41:43.293
But this drill is a dangerous
piece of equipment.

41:43.294 --> 41:44.755
There's gotta be some
sort of emergency system

41:44.756 --> 41:46.509
that cuts the power.

41:46.510 --> 41:48.554
Or not.

41:48.555 --> 41:51.142
You mean something like that?
Should I press it?

41:52.394 --> 41:54.148
I have a better idea.

41:55.234 --> 41:55.985
Stand back.

42:08.134 --> 42:09.053
Come on!

42:10.640 --> 42:12.644
-Come on! Molly!
-Oh, jeez.

42:16.359 --> 42:18.029
Molly, you can do it!

42:18.030 --> 42:19.365
Molly, come on,
you got this!

42:24.458 --> 42:25.502
Come on, Molly,
here we go!

42:28.091 --> 42:28.968
- -Come on, keep pushing!
- -

42:32.601 --> 42:33.894
Whoa!

42:37.944 --> 42:40.073
Wow,
that is one deep-ass hole.

42:40.074 --> 42:42.077
Where are the guards?

42:47.714 --> 42:49.258
Fill the hole!

43:13.431 --> 43:16.563
Stuck around for more lessons, I
would've shown you how to do that.

43:16.564 --> 43:19.110
-It's time to come home, son.
-I'm not going anywhere with you!

43:19.111 --> 43:21.699
- - Alex, please.
-  - We know you have a lot of questions.

43:21.700 --> 43:23.744
You mean like how could
you murder 15 kids?

43:23.745 --> 43:25.957
We promise you everything we've
done, we've done for you.

43:25.958 --> 43:27.585
How can you even say that!

43:27.586 --> 43:29.715
-Because it's true.
-We love you.

43:29.716 --> 43:30.967
You guys don't get it.

43:30.968 --> 43:32.428
We're not
on the same side anymore.

43:32.429 --> 43:34.850
Sides? There aren't any sides.

43:34.851 --> 43:36.102
We're a family.

43:36.103 --> 43:37.062
We are a family.

43:39.316 --> 43:41.154
And we'll fight you
if we have to!

43:49.462 --> 43:50.548
Holy...

43:50.549 --> 43:51.424
...shit.

43:52.761 --> 43:54.346
Did you know about this?

43:55.474 --> 43:56.392
No.

44:06.162 --> 44:08.041
But it's what I was afraid of.
