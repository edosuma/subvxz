WEBVTT

00:14.723 --> 00:19.394
My mother used to say
that going to sleep was a leap of faith.

00:22.231 --> 00:26.193
Our souls wander when we dream,
or so she told me.

00:30.948 --> 00:33.075
And if we say our devotions,

00:34.159 --> 00:37.329
our souls will find their way back
before we wake.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.461
Climbing from our cradle is another leap.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.215
So is leaving the comfort of home.

00:51.844 --> 00:56.765
For some, it's setting sail,
hurtling ourselves into the void.

00:58.851 --> 01:04.272
We send messages into space
hoping someone will answer,

01:05.399 --> 01:09.570
praying we find safe harbor
over the horizon.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.223
Anacreon and Thespis,

01:38.307 --> 01:41.268
you've been at each other's throats
so long,

01:41.935 --> 01:45.647
the origin of your enmity is
almost irrelevant.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.192
We have legitimate grounds for our hatred.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.445
The First Betrayal
and a thousand atrocities since.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.530
No one knows
what really happened that night.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.783
The First Betrayal.

01:57.367 --> 02:01.747
A Thespin king newly wed
to an Anacreon huntress.

02:02.706 --> 02:06.585
The two emerging powers
of the Outer Reach united in marriage.

02:06.668 --> 02:09.170
Are you gonna teach us
our own history now, dead man?

02:09.253 --> 02:11.715
The Thespin dog slit her throat
on their wedding bed.

02:12.508 --> 02:13.884
So the legend goes.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.178
Are you suggesting our history's wrong?

02:16.261 --> 02:21.850
History is written by the victor,
and neither of you seem to be winning.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.393
There was a witness.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.688
The only witness,
an Anacreon handmaid who testified

02:26.772 --> 02:30.192
that King Throy un Thark got drunk
the night of the wedding

02:30.984 --> 02:34.696
and, in a fit of rage,
murdered your huntress.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.490
The handmaid lied.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.159
The nature of the lie is relevant here.

02:40.035 --> 02:43.497
On her deathbed,
the handmaid made a confession.

02:44.206 --> 02:48.043
The real murderer was Cleon II.

02:48.627 --> 02:51.588
The first clone
in the Genetic Dynasty realized

02:51.672 --> 02:54.758
that a plan could unfold
over several lifetimes.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.177
He saw where this new alliance could lead,

02:57.261 --> 03:03.308
so he had his shadowmaster seduce
the handmaiden, drug the newlyweds,

03:03.392 --> 03:06.979
murder your huntress
and implicate your king.

03:07.646 --> 03:10.107
Why fight two upstart kingdoms

03:10.190 --> 03:14.945
when you can exploit their racial animus
and have them fight each other?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.532
The clones played you.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.744
But today, thanks to the Foundation,

03:23.245 --> 03:27.416
we could put back together
what Empire has broken.

03:27.499 --> 03:32.087
No. We are not uniting with them now,
no matter how this started.

03:32.171 --> 03:35.174
And even if we did, Empire is too strong.

03:35.257 --> 03:36.925
Now you have the Invictus.

03:37.009 --> 03:39.136
The Invictus is only one ship.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.722
One ship can be the first of many.

03:41.805 --> 03:46.643
If both your peoples will set aside hatred
in favor of strength,

03:47.269 --> 03:48.979
as those poor newlyweds did,

03:49.062 --> 03:54.026
then you'll find here
the skills necessary to build more ships.

03:54.651 --> 03:58.197
For the Plan to succeed,
the Foundation needs three pillars,

03:58.280 --> 04:01.033
just as a stool needs three legs.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.619
It needs all the children
of the Outer Reach.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.204
That is the way I designed it.

04:05.287 --> 04:09.166
So, Hari, you knew
the Invictus would be discovered?

04:09.666 --> 04:13.420
Hello, Mari. Good to see you again.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.464
Where's Gaal?

04:16.548 --> 04:18.382
She never made it to Terminus.

04:19.551 --> 04:20.886
And you are?

04:22.846 --> 04:23.931
Salvor Hardin.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.225
Mari's daughter.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.353
I'm the one who opened the Vault

04:29.436 --> 04:31.939
and who wrestled that damn ship
onto our doorstep.

04:32.439 --> 04:36.777
Well, Salvor Hardin,
it appears thanks are in order.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.905
As to the mystery of the Invictus,

04:39.988 --> 04:43.492
its appearances were one of the first
tests I gave my predictive models.

04:43.992 --> 04:48.413
Where others saw chaos, I found a pattern.

04:49.039 --> 04:52.709
I don't understand.
We're not revolutionaries.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.378
You said so yourself at the trial.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.339
Well, I might have lied about that.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.235
I am grateful, Brother Dusk.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.946
That I saved our dynasty
from infiltration?

05:22.072 --> 05:26.535
I wonder, Day, if you'd stayed on Trantor
and not traveled to the Maiden,

05:27.327 --> 05:29.454
would you have apprehended
his differences?

05:30.789 --> 05:35.586
You and I are the same.
I have to believe I would have.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.924
The more important question is
what do we do now?

05:42.426 --> 05:44.136
You know what we have to do.

05:59.735 --> 06:00.736
Out.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.951
We're still unraveling
the exact methodology,

06:08.035 --> 06:12.164
but apparently they corrupted
your nanoparticle regimen some time ago.

06:13.332 --> 06:14.541
You're not one of us.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.754
Your DNA has been altered in a dozen ways.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.672
You look like us.

06:23.175 --> 06:24.885
You sound like us, but…

06:31.558 --> 06:33.310
How long have you known?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.770
That I'm different?

06:37.272 --> 06:39.441
I used to steal away
and watch holos of you…

06:41.818 --> 06:42.986
eating breakfast,

06:44.404 --> 06:45.864
sitting in the throne room.

06:46.365 --> 06:49.368
I counted how often you smiled
at your subjects,

06:50.035 --> 06:53.288
whether you sat
with your hands together or apart,

06:53.372 --> 06:55.457
how often you drank from your cup
at meals.

06:55.958 --> 06:58.210
I knew even then that I wasn't like you.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.421
But I wanted to be.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.600
What are you going to do?

07:13.684 --> 07:15.727
You conspired with insurgents.

07:15.811 --> 07:17.229
I wasn't conspiring.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.857
You trusted your secrets to our enemies
and fled the palace.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.317
-She tricked me!
-Because she had a foothold in your heart!

07:22.401 --> 07:24.027
And who created that foothold?

07:24.653 --> 07:25.654
Look at us!

07:26.238 --> 07:28.907
We have no mothers, no aunts, no uncles.

07:28.991 --> 07:30.492
We have sex with concubines

07:30.576 --> 07:32.786
whose memories are erased
the moment we leave them!

07:33.871 --> 07:35.998
Have you never longed to leave this place?

07:37.666 --> 07:41.503
Have you never felt stifled
by the weight of our ascendants?

07:43.297 --> 07:46.717
Can you truly say that
all you've ever wanted

07:46.800 --> 07:51.847
was to be an installment
in a long, long line of us,

07:53.307 --> 07:55.809
living out a script written centuries ago?

08:00.272 --> 08:03.567
All my life,
I've wanted to call you "Father."

08:04.693 --> 08:06.195
But you're not my father.

08:07.738 --> 08:09.573
We're not even people, Day.

08:11.116 --> 08:16.205
We're just… echoes of the first Cleon.

08:18.999 --> 08:22.211
So is a corrupted echo
more original than a perfect one?

08:24.379 --> 08:26.465
Or does it fade away to nothing?

08:35.057 --> 08:38.101
So the curation,
everything we've been doing here,

08:38.184 --> 08:39.352
has all been for nothing?

08:39.436 --> 08:41.230
Not for nothing, Mari.

08:41.813 --> 08:44.274
Your time here on Terminus
hasn't been wasted.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.944
It got you out
from under the Empire's grasp.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.028
It hardened you.

08:48.111 --> 08:52.157
But the Foundation was never
about curating knowledge.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.869
It was about curating people.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.583
You, the original settlers,

09:02.125 --> 09:07.214
you possess qualities vital in forming
the seeds of a new civilization.

09:07.965 --> 09:12.636
And you, Anacreons and Thespins,
you are the consummate survivors.

09:13.303 --> 09:16.348
Consigned to history
by the Empire and yet,

09:17.391 --> 09:20.602
together, you represent the future.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.982
The human race is an ever-evolving story

09:25.065 --> 09:29.528
told over thousands of years
by a countless number of voices.

09:30.821 --> 09:32.030
But for a long time now,

09:32.114 --> 09:36.243
that chorus has been
suffocated and quietly erased.

09:36.827 --> 09:41.164
Because under the Genetic Dynasty,
there is only room for one story.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.583
One voice.

09:42.666 --> 09:46.587
We cannot become who we must become
if the Empire is allowed to persist.

09:48.172 --> 09:51.550
That path leads to
the annihilation of the human race.

09:52.259 --> 09:57.222
Even if we embrace this destiny of yours,
the Empire will be here within weeks.

09:57.306 --> 10:00.767
He's right. They were already
investigating the comms buoy.

10:00.851 --> 10:03.478
It's only a matter of time
before they send reinforcements.

10:03.562 --> 10:08.817
The Empire won't come. Not yet.
Not if they think you're already dead.

10:09.318 --> 10:12.613
Take the Invictus
to the far side of your star,

10:12.696 --> 10:17.367
activate the quantum drive,
but maintain your position in subspace--

10:17.451 --> 10:19.828
The energy signature would read
as a mega-flare.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.290
A mega-flare would wipe out
all life in the system.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.543
The Empire comprises
tens of thousands of worlds.

10:26.627 --> 10:29.880
A dangerous star with dead planets
in a distant arm of the galaxy

10:29.963 --> 10:34.134
won't merit further investigation
even if it did once host the Foundation.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.304
It could work. It could.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.015
As long as don't we stray
beyond the Outer Reach,

10:41.016 --> 10:42.392
we'd be invisible to them.

10:42.476 --> 10:43.644
We'd be free.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.020
You'd be free,

10:45.854 --> 10:50.108
to bide your time, to build,
to become who you need to become.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.737
So, are you the ghost then?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.198
I suppose I am.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.950
-What's it like to die?
-Keir.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.284
What? I want to know.

11:02.746 --> 11:04.039
Did you see anything?

11:05.749 --> 11:07.876
Those are complex questions.

11:07.960 --> 11:11.755
Then answer a simple one.
How'd you get here?

11:12.714 --> 11:14.174
What's your name, son?

11:14.258 --> 11:16.677
Poly. Poly Verisof.

11:17.261 --> 11:20.931
Well, Poly Verisof, shortly before I died,

11:21.598 --> 11:26.937
I swallowed a pill containing millions
of self-replicating molecular machines.

11:27.646 --> 11:31.650
As per my mortality directive,
my casket was jettisoned out into space.

11:32.442 --> 11:35.279
Those machines began breaking down
my body tissue

11:35.362 --> 11:37.906
into all its constituent elements.

11:37.990 --> 11:40.576
Then those machines recycled
those elements,

11:40.659 --> 11:44.329
scooping up more material, ice,
micrometeoroids, et cetera,

11:44.413 --> 11:47.165
assembling
the Vault's internal scaffolding.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.835
You're saying
the Vault isn't just your tomb?

11:51.003 --> 11:52.504
The Vault is you?

11:53.005 --> 11:56.008
You've been on Terminus this whole time,
watching us?

11:56.091 --> 12:00.721
No. It wouldn't have been wise for me
to have been sentient all this time.

12:00.804 --> 12:03.932
That kind of isolation can undo
even the strongest minds.

12:04.433 --> 12:08.562
No, the process of my awakening
was triggered by the Anacreons.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.522
When the null field expanded.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.817
It takes time
to rebuild consciousness, Salvor.

12:13.901 --> 12:17.029
The null field is just part of
the Vault's automatic defense system.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.198
Will we see you again?

12:19.281 --> 12:20.949
I expect so, Poly.

12:22.117 --> 12:26.413
This isn't the Foundation's first crisis,
and it won't be the last.

12:26.997 --> 12:31.001
You've bought a reprieve,
but war with Empire is inevitable.

12:31.793 --> 12:37.591
In the meantime, remember this day.
Remember what we're striving towards.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.928
I know a thousand years can seem
like an eternity,

12:41.428 --> 12:45.057
but it's the blink of an eye when measured
against the whole of human history,

12:45.140 --> 12:49.811
and it could so easily slip
through our fingers if we're not vigilant.

12:53.565 --> 12:57.027
No, wait! So, that's it?
That's all we get?

12:57.110 --> 12:58.779
I've given you what you need.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.532
What about the visions
you've been sending me?

13:01.615 --> 13:02.783
Visions?

13:02.866 --> 13:03.867
Yes.

13:04.368 --> 13:07.412
The ghost. You've been talking to me
since I was a kid.

13:07.496 --> 13:08.914
And I had these visions.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.250
I've seen you on Trantor,
on the slow ship.

13:12.209 --> 13:14.920
They guided me.
You helped me solve the crisis.

13:16.255 --> 13:17.256
Curious.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.218
Well, Salvor Hardin,

13:22.594 --> 13:24.596
whatever messages you've been receiving,

13:24.680 --> 13:28.100
I assure you they haven't come from me.

14:51.725 --> 14:52.726
Walk with me.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.526
I know people hate me, consider me evil.

15:01.318 --> 15:02.986
But it is my detachment,

15:04.696 --> 15:06.406
my indifference to suffering,

15:06.990 --> 15:08.992
that allows me to rule effectively.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.579
The galaxy is so vast,

15:14.039 --> 15:15.958
the problems so large,

15:16.041 --> 15:19.044
that I must turn a blind eye
to the individual.

15:22.881 --> 15:23.882
Look there.

15:26.134 --> 15:30.013
It's a strange burden
not being allowed to carry a burden.

15:32.015 --> 15:35.352
My brothers and I shift it
amongst ourselves because we're a family.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.441
And we love one another in our own way.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.112
I'm sure you find that hard to believe.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.950
Do you ever think
about your legacy, Azura?

15:51.743 --> 15:54.329
The mark you leave behind
after you're gone?

15:58.208 --> 16:02.296
As a child, I wanted to be better
than the Cleons who came before.

16:03.130 --> 16:08.802
Smarter, braver, more dazzling
in the justice I handed out.

16:12.514 --> 16:15.309
But as I matured, my aspirations evolved.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.395
I no longer wanted to be the best.

16:18.896 --> 16:24.359
I wanted to be the same.
Predictable courage, predictable justice.

16:24.443 --> 16:30.073
I wanted my son to be the same too.
Another Cleon. Perfectly Cleon.

16:30.157 --> 16:31.241
He's not your son.

16:34.703 --> 16:35.913
Of course he is.

16:40.209 --> 16:43.712
He is my brother. He is also my son.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.174
I rocked him as a baby.

16:48.175 --> 16:52.596
I cultivated him just as you've nurtured
the plants in this garden.

16:54.264 --> 16:56.808
It's a powerful thing, caring for a life.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.729
Why are you telling me all of this?

17:02.981 --> 17:05.317
Because of all the galaxy's citizens…

17:07.569 --> 17:11.906
you have the singular distinction
of having robbed me of my personal legacy.

17:12.907 --> 17:14.660
Which leads me to your legacy.

17:16.662 --> 17:19.957
I know you're not the architect
of this plot, but you are the face of it.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.501
The face that broke my son's heart.

17:24.211 --> 17:27.464
We traced your family tree
back to your great-great-grandparents,

17:27.548 --> 17:31.844
and then identified all living descendants
branching out from those 16 individuals.

17:32.469 --> 17:35.347
Not just direct descendants,
but all the aunts and uncles,

17:36.431 --> 17:39.351
first and second cousins,
removed or otherwise.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.353
Do you know how many people we uncovered?

17:42.312 --> 17:44.106
712.

17:46.024 --> 17:49.069
Then we located all your friends
and lovers, past and present.

17:49.152 --> 17:53.156
First boy you kissed, the young woman
you gave your virginity to.

17:54.575 --> 17:58.453
Your teachers and coworkers,
even those here on the palace grounds.

17:59.162 --> 18:04.459
We located their parents and siblings.
Basically, anyone in your extended orbit.

18:05.627 --> 18:09.381
That amounted to another 839 individuals.

18:09.882 --> 18:12.759
1,551 people.

18:14.636 --> 18:17.514
The sum total of lives you've made
a meaningful mark on.

18:18.473 --> 18:23.312
In short, the people who would
remember you after you're gone.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.023
Even as we speak,

18:26.106 --> 18:30.110
every member of your personal
constellation is under our surveillance,

18:30.194 --> 18:33.280
a particle beam targeting
each of their brain stems.

18:33.363 --> 18:37.534
At my signal,
they will all cease to exist.

18:42.915 --> 18:43.916
There.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.084
All gone.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.589
Your legacy has been erased, Azura.

18:51.632 --> 18:55.344
Whatever minute waves your being managed
to propagate throughout the universe

18:55.427 --> 18:56.970
have been canceled out.

19:00.807 --> 19:05.395
You will be placed in an automated cell
and fed intravenously,

19:06.021 --> 19:08.357
restrained so as to prevent self-harm.

19:09.233 --> 19:12.194
You will be sensory shrouded
for the rest of your life.

19:12.277 --> 19:17.366
You will never see, nor hear,
nor smell, nor taste, nor touch again.

19:19.034 --> 19:20.369
But you will be aware.

19:21.912 --> 19:25.457
And you will remember
what you have taken from me.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.319
Hari Seldon,

19:56.029 --> 20:01.159
seeing all this coming
and telling us nothing.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.203
I thought we'd be sitting out the fall.

20:04.079 --> 20:05.080
I thought our work

20:05.163 --> 20:08.542
was building a time capsule
some future survivors would open.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.961
I never imagined we'd be
the ones putting the Plan in action.

20:12.921 --> 20:15.048
Do you still believe
the Empire's gonna collapse?

20:16.633 --> 20:17.634
Yes.

20:18.427 --> 20:20.429
Do you still believe
humanity can do better?

20:21.013 --> 20:23.974
Of course I do.
No one sane wants the Empire to continue.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.018
So, what's the difference now?

20:27.686 --> 20:30.814
The difference is,
he didn't just not tell us,

20:32.107 --> 20:33.400
he lied to us.

20:33.901 --> 20:36.195
It's like when I brought you along
to lectures when you were a kid

20:36.278 --> 20:38.488
and gave you a crayon
and told you to take notes.

20:39.948 --> 20:41.283
He gave us busywork.

20:42.367 --> 20:43.660
I believed in him.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.290
Every word.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.879
And he just pulled the rug
out from under us.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.051
How do you think I feel?

21:05.516 --> 21:07.017
I'm sorry he didn't know you.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.354
Know me.

21:11.730 --> 21:12.940
It's more than that.

21:14.775 --> 21:18.946
All these years
thinking the ghost was talking to me.

21:20.948 --> 21:22.699
I convinced myself it was Hari,

21:23.700 --> 21:30.499
and I started to believe that
I actually was special.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.836
But if the visions
weren't coming from him,

21:33.919 --> 21:35.754
then who were they coming from?

21:36.547 --> 21:39.216
No one? My imagination?

21:39.883 --> 21:41.885
You are special, Salvor.

21:44.054 --> 21:45.138
The null field.

21:46.014 --> 21:49.601
What you did, bringing the Invictus,
it meant everything.

21:52.938 --> 21:54.147
We survived…

21:56.358 --> 21:57.442
against all odds.

21:58.110 --> 21:59.486
You were right.

22:01.738 --> 22:03.699
We have to make our own plan now.

22:26.305 --> 22:29.266
I respected her, in a way.

22:31.476 --> 22:32.936
I'm sorry it came down to this.

22:34.062 --> 22:35.063
I'm not.

22:36.398 --> 22:39.610
No next move, just a last one.
Isn't that what you said about her?

22:41.904 --> 22:44.072
I was just trying to rattle you.

22:44.156 --> 22:45.616
Obviously it worked, Warden.

22:48.744 --> 22:52.331
I wanted the next move for my child.

22:54.166 --> 22:57.544
Over a century ago,
this was offered to the emperor in peace.

23:00.672 --> 23:02.007
I'm offering it again…

23:05.511 --> 23:06.512
to you.

23:09.890 --> 23:13.560
She respected you as well, in a way.

23:25.489 --> 23:27.699
Will you take her back to Anacreon?

23:28.575 --> 23:31.662
No. We've brought Anacreon to her.

23:32.412 --> 23:36.208
The cutting is from a Tallyn oak,
the same wood your bow was carved from.

23:36.750 --> 23:40.295
Our foresters tell me it might be
stubborn enough to take root here.

23:42.673 --> 23:43.966
Would you help me, Warden?

23:45.717 --> 23:46.718
Yeah.

24:15.873 --> 24:17.249
In the months that followed,

24:17.332 --> 24:20.377
the children of the Outer Reach
took Hari's words to heart,

24:20.961 --> 24:24.006
setting aside hatred in favor of strength.

24:26.300 --> 24:31.763
It takes more power to build than to burn,
and Hari wanted them to build.

24:35.309 --> 24:36.685
As for the Invictus,

24:36.768 --> 24:40.272
Hugo Crast, of all people,
became its captain.

25:30.948 --> 25:33.492
He took it to the far side of their star

25:33.575 --> 25:38.580
and generated a mega-flare,
allowing the Foundation to be free.

26:06.191 --> 26:07.401
Captain Crast.

26:07.985 --> 26:09.069
-Poly.
-Warden.

26:09.862 --> 26:11.154
How goes the Invictus?

26:11.238 --> 26:13.073
We managed to stabilize the drives,

26:13.156 --> 26:15.701
so we won't be jumping
into the heart of a star anytime soon.

26:15.784 --> 26:17.661
And how long before we can build another?

26:17.744 --> 26:19.288
Eighteen months, ma'am.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.418
-You like it up in space, Poly?
-I do.

26:26.461 --> 26:28.755
And how long are you dirt-side, Captain?

26:29.339 --> 26:30.841
Fourteen long hours, Warden.

26:32.050 --> 26:34.761
Mirror on my telescope's
a little out of alignment.

26:35.262 --> 26:37.639
Think you could help me recollimate it?

26:38.765 --> 26:40.559
Guys, I know what you're talking about.

26:42.144 --> 26:44.688
Well, then why don't you
politely piss off, Poly?

29:04.328 --> 29:05.329
Stop!

29:12.419 --> 29:13.629
Wait!

30:00.592 --> 30:02.511
If it's not you, then who is it, Hari?

30:27.744 --> 30:28.996
I remember this one.

30:30.163 --> 30:31.331
That was your favorite.

30:32.583 --> 30:34.376
You used to sleep with it in your crib.

30:35.586 --> 30:38.422
If you had a nightmare,
he used to say you could blow it,

30:39.673 --> 30:42.009
and the ghosts would fly away.

30:44.052 --> 30:46.597
Most of the time,
just holding it was enough to soothe you.

30:47.222 --> 30:50.058
Thank goodness. A child with a whistle is
a trial for the soul.

30:52.644 --> 30:55.272
He used to drive me crazy
how often I'd find him out here

30:55.355 --> 30:58.609
having fallen asleep while he was working.

30:59.902 --> 31:02.362
He was terrible
when he first started making them.

31:02.863 --> 31:06.700
But after a few hundred nights,
Abbas developed a knack for it.

31:09.536 --> 31:13.123
He'd have been proud, you know?
You becoming mayor, filling his shoes.

31:13.874 --> 31:17.461
The election's just a formality.
Everyone knows you'll win by a landslide.

31:17.544 --> 31:20.881
Mom, who's the girl from the water planet?

31:29.014 --> 31:31.642
On the slow ship,
we had a seed bank program.

31:31.725 --> 31:34.394
It wasn't safe bringing the baby to term
in space,

31:34.478 --> 31:39.691
so we banked our eggs and embryos
as insurance against the future.

31:40.817 --> 31:43.153
I chose one from a controversial donor.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.282
Gaal Dornick.

31:48.659 --> 31:50.410
Any change in your birth directive?

31:52.204 --> 31:54.289
I got to know her a little
before we lost her.

31:54.373 --> 31:56.250
She had a remarkable mind.

31:56.959 --> 31:58.168
And the father?

31:58.877 --> 32:00.337
Raych Foss.

32:00.420 --> 32:02.130
I've seen them both as children.

32:04.591 --> 32:05.634
Gaal tonight.

32:07.135 --> 32:08.887
And Raych…

32:11.223 --> 32:13.058
at the start of the crisis.

32:13.725 --> 32:14.726
Hey!

32:15.435 --> 32:19.106
All this time I thought
I was living Hari's memories.

32:19.857 --> 32:21.358
But I was actually living theirs.

32:22.192 --> 32:24.862
It makes so much sense now,
why I am so different.

32:24.945 --> 32:28.907
I carried you in my womb, Salvor.
You're still my daughter.

32:28.991 --> 32:31.827
I know. But I am their daughter too.

32:34.371 --> 32:36.748
Gaal escaped in a cryo-pod. Where?

32:37.374 --> 32:39.042
I was still early on in our journey.

32:39.126 --> 32:42.129
It would've been
somewhere along the Orion Spur.

32:43.046 --> 32:44.673
I think she's still out there, Mom.

32:46.633 --> 32:50.095
I think she's
the one who's been reaching out to me.

32:50.179 --> 32:53.640
I think that she is
behind all my instincts.

32:53.724 --> 32:55.642
Hon, that was 40 light-years
from Terminus.

32:55.726 --> 32:57.060
How could that possibly work?

32:57.144 --> 32:58.478
I don't know, but it is her.

32:58.562 --> 33:03.901
And if Gaal was special in some way,
any way, it might explain why I am too.

33:03.984 --> 33:06.195
You've always been drawn to the stars.

33:06.278 --> 33:08.155
Yeah, and now we know why.

33:10.115 --> 33:11.783
'Cause something is tugging at me.

33:13.202 --> 33:15.078
Mom, I have to try and find her.

33:16.121 --> 33:17.289
I know, love.

33:20.209 --> 33:21.293
And I want you to.

33:23.086 --> 33:25.088
Here's the thing though, Mom.
I need to go right now.

33:26.048 --> 33:28.800
I'm worried if I don't go now,
I'll never find the courage again.

33:34.890 --> 33:37.851
Take the ghost whistle.
And something else.

33:46.693 --> 33:49.363
When you find her, give her this.

33:51.907 --> 33:53.700
It was always meant to be hers.

33:56.245 --> 33:59.623
I'm sorry. For everything.

34:01.166 --> 34:03.210
There's nothing to forgive, Mom.

34:05.087 --> 34:07.339
I was exactly where I needed to be.

34:44.126 --> 34:45.210
Beggar, wake up.

34:56.554 --> 34:58.015
Figured I'd find you here.

35:00.809 --> 35:01.810
Damn.

35:02.394 --> 35:04.146
You wanted a clean getaway.

35:04.730 --> 35:06.231
I know you too well, Sal.

35:07.774 --> 35:09.860
Think it was
the kiss on the cheek that did it.

35:09.943 --> 35:13.947
I just didn't want it to hurt
any more than it had to.

35:14.865 --> 35:16.325
It's not love if it doesn't hurt.

35:17.618 --> 35:21.038
I learned that when I had to leave Thespis
so the others could eat.

35:22.247 --> 35:23.999
And no one came chasing after me.

35:25.876 --> 35:27.461
Are you chasing after me, then?

35:29.755 --> 35:31.590
You know, you can come if you want to.

35:32.257 --> 35:34.259
I would if you really wanted me to.

35:35.511 --> 35:38.555
But I get the feeling this is
something you need to do alone.

35:42.643 --> 35:45.354
I always knew you'd let this planet
shrug you off one day.

35:47.856 --> 35:50.150
Just figured I'd be by your side
when it happened.

35:51.693 --> 35:52.861
Will you be mad later?

35:54.988 --> 35:55.989
Never.

36:17.177 --> 36:18.762
Take care of my planet, won't you?

36:19.513 --> 36:20.889
Take care of my ship.

36:20.973 --> 36:22.891
She's not your ship anymore.

36:24.643 --> 36:25.811
It's not my planet.

36:30.148 --> 36:31.608
Galaxy's a big place, Sal.

36:33.485 --> 36:35.153
Any idea where you'll start?

36:35.821 --> 36:36.822
Got a hunch.

36:38.740 --> 36:39.741
Go on. Beat it.

36:45.455 --> 36:46.456
Go.

36:47.583 --> 36:48.584
Go on.

37:30.667 --> 37:32.044
Goodbye, Salvor Hardin.

39:02.801 --> 39:03.802
Empire.

39:08.140 --> 39:09.141
It's time.

39:12.352 --> 39:13.353
You must hate me.

39:15.105 --> 39:16.940
I could never hate you, Empire.

39:17.941 --> 39:18.942
I love you.

39:20.277 --> 39:21.695
Because you're programmed to.

39:22.779 --> 39:26.366
All love is programming,
biological or otherwise.

39:27.451 --> 39:30.078
When a human mother looks
into her newborn's eyes,

39:30.621 --> 39:32.414
their brain waves synchronize.

40:08.283 --> 40:09.284
Empire.

40:09.368 --> 40:11.620
Damn your courtly deportment, boy.

40:12.579 --> 40:14.373
You almost brought us down.

40:14.456 --> 40:15.791
I'm sorry, Brother, I--

40:15.874 --> 40:18.794
You are no brother to me, nor to Cleon I,

40:18.877 --> 40:21.505
nor to any other Cleon
who walked these polished floors.

40:21.588 --> 40:23.882
You are a deformity.

40:23.966 --> 40:27.469
And if I had my way,
you would already be ash.

40:29.096 --> 40:30.472
But as you pointed out,

40:30.556 --> 40:34.017
that is a judgment
for the middle throne to decide.

40:36.478 --> 40:37.813
During my time away,

40:37.896 --> 40:41.275
I had much opportunity
to reflect upon our dynasty.

40:43.902 --> 40:46.822
I went to sleep
in one sector of the galaxy,

40:46.905 --> 40:48.574
then awoke in another.

40:50.284 --> 40:53.203
It's a miracle, by all accounts,

40:54.538 --> 40:56.832
folding space and time.

40:57.332 --> 40:59.418
And then, on the Maiden,

41:00.210 --> 41:03.380
I met pilgrims who had worked
their whole lives

41:03.463 --> 41:05.382
just to walk a spiral of salt,

41:05.465 --> 41:09.094
in the hopes that they might be granted
a vision before they die.

41:10.512 --> 41:11.513
I--

41:14.558 --> 41:17.936
We were challenged by a woman who claimed

41:18.020 --> 41:23.400
that a soul incapable of change is
a soul doomed to stagnation.

41:24.902 --> 41:28.197
I believe Seldon himself implied
something similar.

41:29.281 --> 41:32.201
Seldon was a vainglorious fraud.

41:32.284 --> 41:33.410
And yet, Brother--

41:33.911 --> 41:34.912
And yet…

41:36.788 --> 41:41.084
a bough incapable of bending
will eventually break.

41:43.295 --> 41:46.048
It is time the dynasty bent.

41:46.590 --> 41:47.883
Just a little.

41:51.136 --> 41:52.221
Are you insane?

41:53.972 --> 41:55.641
Did that jump addle your brain?

41:56.892 --> 42:00.062
This is why you should never have left.

42:00.646 --> 42:04.691
Our entire empire is built on
imperishable permanence.

42:04.775 --> 42:07.069
If the Galactic Council discovers

42:07.152 --> 42:09.947
-our dynastic thread is broken…
-Galactic Council? They'd never know.

42:10.030 --> 42:12.032
-…we are through!
-We could learn from this.

42:12.115 --> 42:15.536
-Perhaps even benefit from a slight--
-Benefit?

42:15.619 --> 42:17.412
-Demerzel.
-How dare you lay your hands on me?

42:17.496 --> 42:19.581
-You've grown weak.
-Please don't let them kill me.

42:19.665 --> 42:20.999
-I won't.
-This is nonsense.

42:25.963 --> 42:30.259
I would rather decant another one of you,
than have that aberration live amongst us.

42:30.342 --> 42:32.094
The decision is mine to make!

42:32.177 --> 42:33.846
Not if it brings about our ruin!

42:33.929 --> 42:35.639
Psychohistory predicted--

42:35.722 --> 42:37.182
Psychohistory?

42:37.266 --> 42:42.271
We are Empire. History bends to us!

42:43.522 --> 42:44.731
No!

42:52.948 --> 42:54.533
I am loyal, Empire,

42:55.701 --> 42:58.662
to the Cleonic Dynasty above all else.

42:59.663 --> 43:00.664
No.

43:12.968 --> 43:15.512
You can dispose of the body yourself.

43:19.224 --> 43:23.854
I expect another one incarnated
and up to speed by breakfast tomorrow.

45:49.708 --> 45:51.376
What? Speak.

45:53.170 --> 45:55.797
The rebels' plans to undermine the dynasty

45:56.757 --> 45:58.967
appear to be more extensive
than we first believed.

46:03.889 --> 46:06.850
We thought the gene editing was
limited solely to Dawn's person,

46:07.476 --> 46:09.520
that it was done after he was incarnated.

46:10.270 --> 46:11.939
But after more extensive testing,

46:12.689 --> 46:14.816
it seems they've adulterated
the source itself.

46:16.068 --> 46:18.278
Then all replacement clones…

46:19.112 --> 46:20.697
…are no longer pure copies.

46:22.449 --> 46:24.201
When did this happen?

46:24.284 --> 46:25.911
We don't know precisely.

46:27.329 --> 46:33.418
Are you saying that
I, myself, am adulterated?

46:35.879 --> 46:36.880
Possibly.

46:39.633 --> 46:40.634
Yes.

46:42.678 --> 46:43.804
And Dusk?

46:44.680 --> 46:46.598
Empire's being examined as we speak.

46:50.477 --> 46:51.770
Thank you, Shadowmaster.

46:53.313 --> 46:54.314
You may leave.

49:55.746 --> 49:58.165
Entering Synnaxian aerospace.

50:09.968 --> 50:11.470
Initiate reentry.

50:11.553 --> 50:13.305
Secure for reentry.

50:33.033 --> 50:34.451
Climbing from the cradle.

50:36.411 --> 50:38.288
Leaving the comfort of home.

50:40.832 --> 50:42.251
No safe harbor.

50:44.336 --> 50:48.590
86,982,283.

50:48.674 --> 50:52.845
86,982,331…

50:56.390 --> 51:00.644
86,982,341.

51:05.232 --> 51:07.651
Just a cry in the dark.

51:10.946 --> 51:11.947
Are we alone?

51:22.791 --> 51:27.045
And even if we aren't,
will anyone bother to answer?

52:04.416 --> 52:05.626
Okay.

54:08.248 --> 54:09.416
Go away.

56:52.788 --> 56:55.582
Hey. Hey, can you hear me?

56:58.877 --> 57:00.003
It's okay.

57:00.087 --> 57:02.214
It's okay. You're okay. It's okay.

57:03.048 --> 57:05.342
What were you doing down there?

57:05.425 --> 57:08.136
The readout said
you'd been in cryo over a century.

57:09.471 --> 57:11.014
I crash-landed.

57:12.057 --> 57:13.350
I came looking for someone.

57:14.685 --> 57:15.769
Who?

57:23.986 --> 57:24.987
You.

57:27.239 --> 57:28.240
What?

57:32.411 --> 57:36.164
My name is Salvor Hardin.

57:42.421 --> 57:43.547
I'm your daughter.

57:47.467 --> 57:49.219
I'm pretty sure this belongs to you.

58:07.112 --> 58:08.697
Sometimes you leap.

58:10.532 --> 58:13.660
And sometimes, someone catches you.
