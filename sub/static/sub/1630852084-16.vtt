that your daughter

- Mm-hmm.
- BOTH: One, two, three.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.335
The right way.
- Okay.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.771
- You got it, baby.

17:42.871 --> 17:44.572
- Uh, good morning, sweetie.

17:46.474 --> 17:48.676
- What's so good about it?

17:48.743 --> 17:50.545
- Ooh, she coming in hot!

17:50.678 --> 17:54.783
- She thought she threw a
haymaker, and I came in with it.

17:54.883 --> 17:56.951
- I'm with you.
- Alright, cool.

17:57.051 --> 18:00.388
Uh, your mom and I would like
to talk to you.

18:00.488 --> 18:02.190
- Yeah, see, I figured you
wouldn't be

18:02.290 --> 18:04.793
in the geriatric ward
if you didn't.

18:04.893 --> 18:08.730
- There's no need to be rude.

18:08.830 --> 18:10.532
- Well...

18:10.632 --> 18:13.067
- Alright, I'm--I'm out.

18:13.168 --> 18:14.402
I can't--I can't do it.

18:14.502 --> 18:15.870
- You're tapping out already?
- I'm tapping out.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.338
Go ahead, you got it.
- That was quick.

18:17.439 --> 18:18.273
- JEREMY: Mm-hmm.

18:22.977 --> 18:26.781
- Sweetheart.

18:26.881 --> 18:29.417
I know this is hard
for you.

18:29.517 --> 18:30.785
- Do you?

18:30.885 --> 18:32.887
'Cause it doesn't seem
like it.

18:32.987 --> 18:35.457
You and Dad are walking
around here laughing.

18:35.557 --> 18:38.126
It's my life, too.

18:38.226 --> 18:40.728
- Look, what are we supposed
to do, huh?

18:40.829 --> 18:42.430
Walk around here being mad
at everybody?

18:42.530 --> 18:44.566
- You're supposed
to care that I'm upset.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.134
- Baby girl, we care.

18:46.234 --> 18:48.803
- Well, you have a funny way
of showing it.

18:48.903 --> 18:51.706
- Listen, I know
this is hard for you, okay?

18:51.806 --> 18:54.008
We're talking about it, but just
because it's hard for you

18:54.109 --> 18:56.177
doesn't mean that you can come
and go as you please,

18:56.277 --> 19:00.014
and it definitely doesn't
mean you get to disrespect us.

19:00.115 --> 19:03.284
We're not having that, okay?

19:03.384 --> 19:06.154
- Is that all?

19:06.254 --> 19:07.522
- Oh.

19:07.622 --> 19:08.957
- ♪

19:09.057 --> 19:10.358
- I'm tapping out.
- Okay, alright.

19:12.785 --> 19:13.786
- I'm back, I'm going in,
okay?

19:13.886 --> 19:15.121
- Okay, thank you.
- Now I gotta--I got

19:15.221 --> 19:16.589
to be a little hood.
- Ooh, yeah.

19:16.689 --> 19:17.790
- Gonna bring the hood out.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.191
- Come on with yourself.
- Yeah, you're grounded!

19:19.291 --> 19:20.559
- Uh-huh.
- You're not leaving

19:20.660 --> 19:23.029
this house, you don't go
nowhere,

19:23.129 --> 19:25.431
and I don't wanna see you around
that big head boy no more.

19:25.531 --> 19:26.599
- Yeah!
- Mm.

19:26.699 --> 19:27.967
- Mm.

19:30.569 --> 19:31.604
- Or?

19:36.142 --> 19:37.343
- I got it.
- Mm, yeah.

19:37.443 --> 19:38.944
- This gonna get her right here.
- Right here.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.179
- This is the one.
- It's it.

19:40.279 --> 19:43.916
- Okay. Oh, --or we gonna
send you to Chicago

19:44.016 --> 19:47.520
to live with your aunt.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.221
- Wait, really?

19:49.322 --> 19:51.357
Oh, my God, that's so great.

19:51.457 --> 19:52.124
When can I leave?

19:52.224 --> 19:53.626
I'll go pack right now.

19:55.294 --> 19:56.962
I get to see all my friends!

19:59.765 --> 20:01.167
- What did you say?!

20:03.336 --> 20:05.604
- Damn, that ain't work.
- No!

20:05.705 --> 20:06.939
'Cause that wasn't a threat.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.075
That was a good thing.

20:09.175 --> 20:11.444
- How?
- [exhales]

20:11.544 --> 20:14.513
Why--why would she say no to
that, huh? Hmm?

20:14.613 --> 20:16.515
- Well, 'cause nobody likes
your sister.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.253
- I slightly remember
you liking my sister.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.822
- Hmm?
- Uh-huh, you remember asking

20:22.922 --> 20:24.824
her for her phone number?
- No.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.292
- Oh yes.
- No, no.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.894
I said I wanted y'all's number.
Y'all's.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.663
- Oh, y'all you.
- Y'all's.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.832
- 'Cause y'all lived in the same
house, it wasn't no cell phones.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.233
Remember?
- Uh-huh.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.801
- Remember, come on.
- But, see, she tricked you,

20:35.901 --> 20:37.703
and then she gave you
my number.

20:37.803 --> 20:39.839
- Mm.
- And here I am

20:39.939 --> 20:42.341
two kids later.

20:42.441 --> 20:46.145
Demon child.
- Hold up, hold up.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.447
That's what happened?

20:48.547 --> 20:50.583
- Uh. [laughs]

20:50.683 --> 20:51.751
I love you.
