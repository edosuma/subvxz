Oh, God.

00:04.265 --> 00:07.355
[sighs]

00:07.442 --> 00:10.358
Oh, God, why did I think
I could write a book?

00:10.445 --> 00:13.535
Ooh! This is bad.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.800
Ooh, this is really bad.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.541
Oh.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.238
Ooh, that sucks.

00:21.325 --> 00:22.805
That sucks.

00:22.892 --> 00:23.893
Oh... it still sucks.

00:23.980 --> 00:26.504
Still sucks!

00:26.591 --> 00:27.810
You know what?

00:27.897 --> 00:30.508
I'll do... do that and that.

00:31.944 --> 00:35.339
Yeah! Yeah!

00:35.426 --> 00:37.428
[grunting]

00:37.515 --> 00:38.734
Hey.
[grunting]

00:38.821 --> 00:40.257
What are you
doing up so late?

00:40.344 --> 00:42.303
I'm working on my book.

00:43.956 --> 00:45.306
Okay. I take it...
[groans]

00:45.393 --> 00:47.482
take it you're
not happy with it.

00:47.569 --> 00:50.441
Is that why you're a cop?
'Cause nothing fools you.

00:50.528 --> 00:52.574
Ooh.

00:52.661 --> 00:54.445
Can't be that bad.

00:54.532 --> 00:56.969
It's horrible, and the...

00:57.057 --> 01:00.538
And I did everything, exactly
what the guy told me to do

01:00.625 --> 01:02.497
in the How to Write Your Book
book.

01:02.584 --> 01:06.370
Let the characters take me where
they wanted to go.

01:06.457 --> 01:08.894
All right, and where
did they take you?
Well,

01:08.981 --> 01:10.070
they started off falling
deeply in love

01:10.157 --> 01:11.941
in Tudor England.

01:12.028 --> 01:13.073
Where's Tudor?
In...

01:13.160 --> 01:15.075
It's when!

01:15.162 --> 01:16.467
It's "when" is Tudor!

01:16.554 --> 01:18.252
It's the 16th century!

01:18.339 --> 01:20.471
Okay, and-and...

01:20.558 --> 01:23.170
a hundred and something
pages later, they're fighting...

01:23.257 --> 01:25.650
they're fighting space vampires.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.261
Why?!

01:27.348 --> 01:29.524
That sounds like something
I would read.

01:29.611 --> 01:30.873
I know!

01:30.960 --> 01:33.441
Aw, damn it.

01:33.528 --> 01:34.616
What are you doing?

01:34.703 --> 01:36.052
What needs
to be done.

01:36.139 --> 01:39.447
No, no, no, no!
Yeah.

01:39.534 --> 01:41.492
Molly, no! Hey!

01:41.579 --> 01:42.580
Just get back!

01:42.667 --> 01:44.930
Get back!
Please. Come on.

01:49.761 --> 01:51.937

Remember, Mol,
if you heave from your core,

02:21.315 --> 02:24.709
it's also a good ab workout.

02:24.796 --> 02:26.842
[retching]

02:26.929 --> 02:28.452
There you go.

02:28.539 --> 02:29.236
Hey, how's she doing?

02:37.244 --> 02:40.072
Oh, my famous hangover cure.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.119
Isn't that for Molly?

02:43.206 --> 02:45.165
Hey, it's like on an airplane.

02:45.252 --> 02:48.820
You put on your own oxygen mask
before you put one on the kid.

02:48.907 --> 02:51.997
There's my
little girl.

02:52.084 --> 02:54.086
You okay, Mol?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.827
Yeah, right as rain.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.221
All right. Come on,
let's get you up.

02:58.308 --> 03:00.397
Oh. No, no, no, no.

03:00.484 --> 03:02.051
Better down.
Better down.

03:02.138 --> 03:03.966
Oh, oh, oh, bring her
down, bring her down.

03:05.663 --> 03:07.230
Why did I quit teaching
to be a writer?

03:07.317 --> 03:10.929
Because you wanted
to follow your dreams.

03:11.016 --> 03:12.279
Does this look like my dream?

03:15.020 --> 03:16.326
Oh, I swear.

03:16.413 --> 03:19.111
I swear I will never
drink again.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.897
You're a Flynn.
Of course you will.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.507
Here, you go.
Sip this.

03:23.594 --> 03:24.204
It'll make you
feel better.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.641
[sighs]

03:26.728 --> 03:28.599
Ew.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.819
Oh, God, that's mostly vodka.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.823
Do you want to feel
better or not?

03:34.910 --> 03:38.174
Remember: you never have a
hangover if you stay loaded.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.133
That actually looks good.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.135
Mom, you want one?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.833
Oh, I already
made a pitcher.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.878
Grab some glasses
and bring it in.

03:50.404 --> 03:53.102
First, she quits her job,

03:53.189 --> 03:55.844
and I was right there to support
her through the whole thing.

03:55.931 --> 03:59.108
Yes, you were.You the man.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.979
Then, she spends
I don't know how many months

04:01.066 --> 04:04.374
trying to write a book, and once
again, I'm 100% in her corner.

04:04.461 --> 04:06.246
We saw it.
A hundred percent.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.815
But last night,
I walk into the kitchen,

04:10.902 --> 04:13.296
she's in a drunken rage,
trying to burn her book.

04:13.383 --> 04:14.602
And that's where
I got to draw the line.

04:14.689 --> 04:18.562
Draw that line.You got no choice.

04:18.649 --> 04:19.476
I mean, I know marriage is
supposed to be

04:19.563 --> 04:21.348
for better or for worse,

04:21.435 --> 04:23.915
but how much worse
is it going to get?

04:26.527 --> 04:28.616
Really? Nothing?

04:28.703 --> 04:30.661
What do we know?

04:30.748 --> 04:33.708
I can't even afford
a prostitute.

04:33.795 --> 04:36.580
I just hate being
on this roller coaster.

04:36.667 --> 04:39.496
She needs to pick a career
and stick with it.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.324
What would happen
if you just put your foot down?

04:41.411 --> 04:43.805
I have no idea.
I've never done it before.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.850
That's why we live
with her mother,

04:45.937 --> 04:48.984
and I have 30 pillows
on my bed.

04:49.071 --> 04:51.073
Well, you need to do something,
because all this marital stress

04:51.160 --> 04:52.596
is starting to affect
your police work.

04:52.683 --> 04:54.772
[laughs]

04:54.859 --> 04:56.687
What are you laughing at?

04:56.774 --> 04:59.386
Nothing. The city of Chicago
sleeps well at night,

04:59.473 --> 05:00.256
knowing you're on the day shift.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.260
Hey, I am a good cop.

05:04.347 --> 05:05.870
And you know why?

05:05.957 --> 05:07.655
Because I've never had
any fancy ambitions

05:07.742 --> 05:09.178
or dreams to be anything else.

05:09.265 --> 05:10.484
Just a simple man.

05:10.571 --> 05:13.269
Nothing fancy about you.

05:15.445 --> 05:19.493
That's starting
to get real annoying.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.843
Sorry.
I was beginning
to feel that myself.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.500
WOMAN:
Our solar system

05:26.587 --> 05:29.633
is made up of eight planets
orbiting around the sun.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.419
Earth is one of them.

05:32.506 --> 05:35.030
Can anyone name the rest
of the planets?

05:36.292 --> 05:38.207
Anyone?

05:38.294 --> 05:39.730
Oh, come on!

05:39.817 --> 05:41.166
I taught you guys this!

05:41.253 --> 05:44.344
You're making melook
like an idiot!

05:45.562 --> 05:47.042
Security?

05:47.129 --> 05:49.174
Hey, I never had a phone.

05:49.261 --> 05:49.479
Cool.

05:51.742 --> 05:54.310
Did you miss me?

05:54.397 --> 05:56.617
[blows on glass]

05:56.704 --> 05:58.488
[laughs]

06:03.580 --> 06:06.627
Thanks for getting me out
of the principal's office.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.892
You're welcome.
How do you feel?

06:10.979 --> 06:15.636
Well, the booze has worn off,
so the shame's setting in.

06:15.723 --> 06:18.987
What were you thinking,
coming to the school like that?

06:19.074 --> 06:22.512
I don't know. I guess I just
wanted to see my old life.

06:22.599 --> 06:25.123
Why the hell would you want
to do that?

06:25.210 --> 06:26.429
It's like when you break up
with a guy,

06:26.516 --> 06:28.562
and you drive by his house.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.215
You're just trying
to convince yourself

06:30.302 --> 06:31.608
that you made
the right decision.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.349
When I drive by an ex's house,

06:33.436 --> 06:35.525
it's only to put a brick
through his window

06:35.612 --> 06:37.571
or something dead
in the mailbox.

06:37.658 --> 06:41.139
Oh, my God. Can't you just
crank-call him or something?

06:41.226 --> 06:42.489
I do. I tell him to
check the mailbox.

06:47.145 --> 06:49.060
I take it your
writing career

06:49.147 --> 06:52.063
isn't exactly what
you thought it'd be.

06:52.150 --> 06:54.239
It's just a lot harder
than I thought.

06:54.326 --> 06:56.720
And the other day,
I-I spent four hours

06:56.807 --> 06:59.201
on one sentence,
just trying to get it right.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.202
Hmm.

07:00.289 --> 07:01.856
What was the sentence?

07:01.943 --> 07:05.686
"She stood there
in silence thinking."

07:05.773 --> 07:10.081
Wouldn't it be, "She silently
stood there, thinking?"

07:10.168 --> 07:14.216
Oh, God, even you're
a better writer than I am.

07:14.303 --> 07:16.261
Ah, don't beat
yourself up.

07:16.348 --> 07:18.089
Maybe you're just
not talented.

07:18.176 --> 07:20.178
Yeah, that's what
I've been saying.

07:20.265 --> 07:23.051
But everybody in that house
is so damned supportive.[laughs]

07:23.138 --> 07:26.315
Well, that's why you got me.

07:26.402 --> 07:28.404
You know, I've kind of

07:28.491 --> 07:31.755
been putting Mike
through a lot lately.

07:31.842 --> 07:34.454
He doesn't have to know about
this little field trip, does he?

07:34.541 --> 07:35.977
[sighs]

07:36.064 --> 07:38.327
Gee, I hate
to keep stuff from my boy.

07:38.414 --> 07:40.938
Oh, come on. He keeps stuff
from you all the time.

07:41.025 --> 07:43.027
You know, we were in town
this Thanksgiving.

07:43.114 --> 07:44.202
Really?

07:44.289 --> 07:45.900
You kept the lights off all day.

07:45.987 --> 07:46.857
You did a drive-by?

07:46.944 --> 07:49.556
I invented the drive-by.

07:51.079 --> 07:53.081
All right, I'll keep
your little secret.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.691
Thank you.

07:54.778 --> 07:57.999
But there's got to be
some quid pro quo.

07:58.086 --> 08:00.567
Okay, what kind of quo
are we talking about?

08:00.654 --> 08:01.568
[sighs]

08:01.655 --> 08:03.657
I don't know.

08:03.744 --> 08:06.616
Let me sit silently
and think about it.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.531
Wouldn't it be "Sit in silence"?

08:08.618 --> 08:10.620
Seriously?
Sorry.

08:13.362 --> 08:14.972
[indistinct voices on TV]

08:15.059 --> 08:16.713
Hey.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.281
What are you doing home
in the middle of the day?

08:19.368 --> 08:21.152
I forgot the key
to the warehouse crapper,

08:21.239 --> 08:23.459
and my guys are all bitching
about having to go outside.

08:23.546 --> 08:27.289
You make them go outside?

08:27.376 --> 08:28.595
Hey, it's not called a Dumpster
for nothing.

08:28.682 --> 08:32.555
Oh.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.209
What's with you?
You sick?

08:34.296 --> 08:35.558
Just of my life.
Okay.

08:35.645 --> 08:38.866
That's more
than I want to get into.

08:39.954 --> 08:42.260
You asked.

08:42.347 --> 08:43.740
You know what your problem is?

08:43.827 --> 08:44.524
You think too much.
You question everything.

08:44.611 --> 08:45.525
Is that so?

08:45.612 --> 08:47.701
See? You just did it.

08:49.398 --> 08:52.836
You know what I'm thinking
right now? Nothing.

08:52.923 --> 08:55.752
No. Wait.
Here comes something.

08:55.839 --> 08:58.712
♪ Who's bending down
to give me a rainbow? ♪

08:58.799 --> 09:01.453
♪ Everyone knows it's Windy. ♪

09:01.541 --> 09:03.543
Remember that song?

09:03.630 --> 09:06.502
Not like that.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.939
Listen, I know

09:09.026 --> 09:10.637
you're going through some kind
of inner turmoil

09:10.724 --> 09:14.205
vis-à-vis your questionable
life choices.

09:15.685 --> 09:16.947
But hang in there.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.688
Six months ago,
I was flat broke.

09:18.775 --> 09:20.647
Now I have
a 10,000-square-foot warehouse

09:20.734 --> 09:24.781
with two full-time employees
and three illegals.

09:24.868 --> 09:27.262
Congratulations.

09:27.349 --> 09:29.220
Actually, I just lost
two of my illegals.

09:29.307 --> 09:34.399
INS did a sweep, and only one
of them hid in the bathroom.

09:34.486 --> 09:36.619
That's where the keys are.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.752
All right, see you later.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.449
See ya.

09:40.536 --> 09:42.016
Here's a thought.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.496
Why don't you get off
your mopey keister

09:44.584 --> 09:45.672
and come help me
down at the warehouse?

09:45.759 --> 09:49.501
Oh, here's a thought. No!

09:49.589 --> 09:51.329
Why not? You're strong,

09:51.416 --> 09:53.201
you got all your fingers,
and you have no other options.

09:53.288 --> 09:56.639
You either work for me,
or you build iPhones in China.

09:56.726 --> 10:00.512
Thank you, but I don't see
myself working in a warehouse.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.514
What, you too good for it?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.473
Did you know
William Faulkner

10:04.560 --> 10:08.390
worked in a power plant
when he wrote As I Lay Dying?

How did you know that?

10:29.237 --> 10:31.587
No thinking,
no worrying, just...

10:31.674 --> 10:33.545
just doing.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.026
Okay.

10:36.113 --> 10:37.506
You're on, Vince.

10:37.593 --> 10:39.508
Okay, I'm gonna go
change my clothes.

10:39.595 --> 10:41.118
Oh, what's the vibe down there?

10:41.205 --> 10:41.684
Is is like, you know,
flannels and dickies?

10:41.771 --> 10:43.425
Huh?

10:43.512 --> 10:44.731
Oh, forget it.

10:44.818 --> 10:47.298
I'll just throw
something together.

Joyce, you mind if I ask
you a personal question?

11:40.917 --> 11:42.876
17, high school
gym teacher.

11:46.836 --> 11:48.011
What?

11:48.098 --> 11:50.666
What?

11:50.753 --> 11:52.668
No, uh, my question
is about the change

11:52.755 --> 11:56.280
that happens in a woman's life.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.108
Like puberty?

11:58.195 --> 11:59.457
Later.

11:59.544 --> 11:59.762
Adultery?

12:07.378 --> 12:08.553
Later.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.990
Menopause?

12:10.077 --> 12:11.469
Yeah, that.
When does that start?

12:11.556 --> 12:13.515
How would Iknow?

12:14.821 --> 12:16.344
Come on, Joyce, I...

12:16.431 --> 12:17.606
I'm worried about Molly.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.216
She's all over the place lately.

12:19.303 --> 12:20.740
And like every
other man,

12:20.827 --> 12:23.612
you want to make a
vaginal issue about it.

12:23.699 --> 12:25.266
I don't want to,
I-I just want to know

12:25.353 --> 12:27.181
what's going on with my wife.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.748
Well, you can relax. Molly's
not going through menopause.

12:28.835 --> 12:31.489
She's just trying
to find herself.

12:31.576 --> 12:32.621
Yeah, I keep hearing that.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.275
But-but what does that mean?

12:34.362 --> 12:36.190
I don't know.
It's just a thing you say

12:36.277 --> 12:38.758
when somebody's
gone bat-crap crazy.

12:38.845 --> 12:39.846
MOLLY:
Mike!

12:39.933 --> 12:41.630
Mike!

12:41.717 --> 12:43.327
Ooh, you'll
never guess

12:43.414 --> 12:44.807
who drove a forklift
down at Vince's warehouse.

12:44.894 --> 12:47.244
Me!
[laughs]

12:48.550 --> 12:49.769
Good luck.

12:49.856 --> 12:50.987
I got her
through puberty.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.949
Wait, hold on. Uh, my wife
is a forklift driver now?

12:56.036 --> 12:58.560
Yeah, it was just for today.

12:58.647 --> 12:59.517
Are you kidding me?

12:59.604 --> 13:00.867
I need you all week.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.129
You're a force of nature.

13:02.216 --> 13:04.174
She outworked my Mexicans.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.395
They're Guatemalan,
Vince.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.266
I don't care what part
of Mexico they're from.

13:09.353 --> 13:10.615
They're good workers.

13:10.702 --> 13:10.920
And you outdid 'em.

13:13.227 --> 13:16.796
What is
happening here?

13:16.883 --> 13:19.668
I was sitting around,
feeling sorry for myself,

13:19.755 --> 13:23.411
and Vince offered me,
you know, an honest day's work.

13:23.498 --> 13:25.543
Oh, who-who said anything
about honest? [chuckles]

13:25.630 --> 13:27.894
I don't know
what the boys told you, but

13:27.981 --> 13:29.156
I can pay you
off the books in cash

13:29.243 --> 13:31.158
or fill your trunk
with beer.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.639
Well, we could
use the money.

13:34.726 --> 13:35.684
We'll take the cash.

13:35.771 --> 13:36.554
They all do.

13:36.641 --> 13:39.035
The first week.

13:39.122 --> 13:42.386
Okay, uh, let me see
if I got this straight.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.388
You were a teacher.

13:44.475 --> 13:46.390
Then you became a writer.

13:46.477 --> 13:48.131
Now you're a forklift driver.

13:48.218 --> 13:51.787
[laughing softly]:
Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

14:00.796 --> 14:02.580
I could watch
you all day.
It's like

14:02.667 --> 14:04.234
a beautiful dance.

14:04.321 --> 14:05.845
You're the Deney Terrio
of forklift drivers.

14:05.932 --> 14:09.196
I don't know who
that is, but thank you.

14:09.283 --> 14:10.980
Come down from there,
we need to talk.

14:12.199 --> 14:13.809
Sure,
what's up?

14:13.896 --> 14:15.855
You seem to be taking
to this job, am I right?

14:15.942 --> 14:17.030
Yeah, I'm...
I'm having a blast.

14:17.117 --> 14:19.336
Good, that's
what I thought.

14:19.423 --> 14:20.337
[chuckles]

14:20.424 --> 14:22.339
I see something
in you.

14:22.426 --> 14:23.514
You're smart,

14:23.601 --> 14:25.125
hardworking,
bullheaded.

14:25.212 --> 14:26.517
Oh.
We're not blood,

14:26.604 --> 14:29.216
but you remind me
of a young me.

14:29.303 --> 14:31.131
Oh, God, that started off
as a compliment.

14:31.218 --> 14:33.960
Then it took
a really ugly turn.

14:34.047 --> 14:35.265
What I'm saying is,
those are the traits

14:35.352 --> 14:37.789
a person needs to
run a business.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.443
Well, that and
a willingness

14:39.530 --> 14:42.664
to set fire to a factory
when things go south.

14:42.751 --> 14:45.232
What are you...?
What are you getting at, Vince?

14:45.319 --> 14:47.799
I want you to help
me run the company,

14:47.887 --> 14:51.107
and one day, carry
on the Moranto name.

14:51.194 --> 14:52.848
Are you serious? I've...

14:52.935 --> 14:53.980
I've only been here
for two days.

14:54.067 --> 14:56.069
Two glorious days.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.549
And who else do I got?

14:58.636 --> 15:00.595
If there is one regret
I have in my life,

15:00.682 --> 15:03.685
it's that a child...

15:03.772 --> 15:06.383
has never come
from these loins.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.865
Well, I think nature has a way

15:09.952 --> 15:11.867
of weeding its own garden.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.913
What do you say?

15:14.000 --> 15:17.003
You want to be my
heir apparently?

15:17.090 --> 15:20.397
Just let me mull it over.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.225
I'll... I'll run it by Mike.

15:22.312 --> 15:23.661
Sure. I understand.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.272
You don't want to
jump into something

15:25.359 --> 15:27.491
that might solve all
your financial problems

15:27.578 --> 15:29.754
in one fell swoop.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.931
Think about it.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.499
I could, too.

15:35.586 --> 15:38.198
I could totally
torch this place.

15:46.380 --> 15:49.035
So, what do you think?
I mean, it's a lot of money.

15:49.122 --> 15:50.732
I do like that part.

15:50.819 --> 15:52.038
I mean, it would mean
me giving up my writing.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.431
Sure would.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.346
I could work for
Vince during the week

15:56.433 --> 15:57.869
and then write
on the weekends.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.828
Well, there you go.

15:59.915 --> 16:02.483
Then when...? Then when would
our special quality time be?

16:02.570 --> 16:04.615
That's a very good question.

16:04.702 --> 16:07.053
So, you-you think I should
tell Vince "no," huh?

16:07.140 --> 16:10.012
I think you need
to follow your heart on this.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.101
Oh, for God's sakes,
Mike, have an opinion!

16:12.188 --> 16:15.061
I'm trying not to!

16:15.148 --> 16:17.106
What?!

16:17.193 --> 16:20.544
I don't know what's going on,
and I'm a little afraid of you!

16:20.631 --> 16:22.503
Why?

16:22.590 --> 16:25.158
Molly, in the last three months,
you've changed jobs three times.

16:25.245 --> 16:28.596
I've barely changed pants
that many times.

16:28.683 --> 16:31.033
Well, and it's
confusing for me, too.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.123
You know, I'm trying
to find myself.

16:34.210 --> 16:37.257
I know I don't want
to teach anymore,

16:37.344 --> 16:38.780
and I don't...

16:38.867 --> 16:40.912
I don't know if I'm
good enough to write.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.827
And for some
weird reason,

16:42.914 --> 16:45.700
I can drive the bejesus
out of a forklift.

16:47.528 --> 16:49.443
You don't have
to find yourself!

16:49.530 --> 16:50.313
Ifound you.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.011
And you're perfect.

16:54.883 --> 16:57.538
Mmm. That's really sweet.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.629
But that doesn't
really help me...

17:01.716 --> 17:03.196
Aah, I can't. I can't.

17:11.465 --> 17:14.250
Sweetie, it's 4:00 a.m.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.209
When are you
coming to bed?
Oh, soon.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.211
I just... just have some ideas
I want to get down.

17:18.298 --> 17:21.475
So, you're quitting
the warehouse gig?

17:21.562 --> 17:25.348
No. It means I'm taking
the warehouse gig.

17:25.435 --> 17:27.350
But you're writing.

17:27.437 --> 17:28.873
Exactly.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.136
Huh?
I mean, not
worrying about the writing

17:30.223 --> 17:33.139
got me thinking
about the warehouse.

17:33.226 --> 17:35.358
And then, the warehouse
started making me think, like,

17:35.445 --> 17:38.231
"Ooh, that's a pretty good place
for a murder mystery setting."

17:38.318 --> 17:39.884
And then, next thing I know,

17:39.971 --> 17:41.930
I'm four victims
and six chapters in.

17:42.017 --> 17:43.279
It's a bloodbath!

17:48.110 --> 17:51.418
Okay, all right.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.550
Sounds like you got
it all worked out.

17:53.637 --> 17:55.726
Yes, I do.

17:55.813 --> 17:58.555
Well, if you are going
to the warehouse tomorrow,

17:58.642 --> 18:00.079
which... I
think you are...

18:05.040 --> 18:06.911
...you should probably
get some sleep.

18:06.998 --> 18:08.652
Yeah, I'll be right there.

18:08.739 --> 18:11.307
Ooh. The warehouse supervisor
doesn't know it yet,

18:11.394 --> 18:14.049
but he's about to get skewered
by a forklift.

18:14.136 --> 18:17.618
[laughing]

18:20.447 --> 18:22.797
Ooh.

18:26.061 --> 18:28.194
Oh.

18:33.155 --> 18:34.635
Hey, kid?

18:34.722 --> 18:36.941
You okay?
You look a little tired.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.508
I'm fine.
You sure?

18:38.595 --> 18:40.075
Why don't you
take a break?

18:40.162 --> 18:42.599
No, I just... I just
need another run at it.

18:42.686 --> 18:45.689
Just, all right, I got this.

18:51.086 --> 18:53.306
[loud thudding and clanking]

18:53.393 --> 18:55.960
You know what?

18:56.047 --> 18:59.007
I think I am gonna take you up
on that break.

19:05.274 --> 19:08.190
This is not bad.

19:08.277 --> 19:12.368
Ooh, not bad at all.

19:13.456 --> 19:17.417
Ooh. That's pretty great.

19:18.505 --> 19:20.115
Hello.

19:20.202 --> 19:21.377
Hi.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.292
It's time.
For what?

19:23.379 --> 19:26.034
Quid pro quo.
Come on, let's go.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.905
Where are we going?None of your business.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.646
Know how to handle
a chainsaw?
What?

19:29.733 --> 19:31.039
Oh, never mind. I'll show
you when we get there.
