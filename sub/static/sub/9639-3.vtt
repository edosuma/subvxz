00:05.340 --> 00:08.070
Check it out.
l got an F on my Spanish midterm.

00:08.210 --> 00:09.900
Why are you so happy about it?

00:10.040 --> 00:11.640
Because Riley got an F too.

00:11.780 --> 00:15.110
That means he's been paying as much
attention to me as l've been to him.

00:15.250 --> 00:17.150
Failing Spanish is hard work.

00:18.320 --> 00:20.290
How is failing Spanish hard work?

00:20.420 --> 00:22.750
Every day, l show up late
so he'll definitely notice me.

00:22.890 --> 00:25.190
Then l forget my textbook
so we have to share one.

00:25.330 --> 00:27.420
And finally, l let the teacher catch us
passing notes

00:27.560 --> 00:29.760
so she keeps us both after class.

00:29.900 --> 00:31.660
That is hard work.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.270
You must be exhausted.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.530
That's why l sleep during History.

00:35.670 --> 00:38.300
- Hey, Alex.
- Hey, Riley.

00:38.440 --> 00:41.740
A bunch of us are going to this cool
restaurant, Medium Rare, on Friday night.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.040
Wanna come?

00:43.180 --> 00:45.150
Oh, sure, Medium Rare.
l go there all the time.

00:45.280 --> 00:47.310
But it's new. Friday's opening night.

00:47.450 --> 00:50.440
Oh, Medium Rare.
l thought you said Medium Roar.

00:50.590 --> 00:53.180
You know, like, bigger than a kitten
and smaller than a lion.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.520
You know, like a cougar.
Anyway, it's out by the zoo.

00:56.160 --> 00:57.280
You can come too.

00:57.430 --> 01:02.690
Well, l might as well, since my best friend
never took me to Medium Roar.

01:06.570 --> 01:10.590
Look at that. All those hours
l didn't spend on studying totally paid off.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.380
Oh, no. Here comes your brother.

01:15.510 --> 01:16.810
l think he's coming over here.

01:16.940 --> 01:19.670
Oh, he's so cute.
l never know what to say to him.

01:19.810 --> 01:22.010
Just talk about current events.
He loves current events.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.580
Hey, guys.

01:24.020 --> 01:26.040
Alex failed her Spanish midterm.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.820
Not that current.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:26.780 --> 02:29.720
Hey, guess who got asked out
on a date today, me or Justin.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.340
Not Justin.

02:32.620 --> 02:36.220
l'm more interested in learning
about what happened in Spanish class.

02:36.360 --> 02:37.880
Yeah, we heard you failed.

02:38.690 --> 02:39.790
That's right.

02:39.930 --> 02:43.060
l did fail, but l can explain.

02:43.200 --> 02:47.400
There l was,
studying as hard as l ever have.

02:47.540 --> 02:51.130
But l couldn't concentrate,
because right outside that window,

02:51.270 --> 02:53.210
the boys were playing paintball,

02:53.710 --> 02:55.730
and l didn't wanna ruin their fun.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.510
Paintball on the terrace?

02:57.650 --> 02:59.770
l told you not to
because it chips the bricks.

02:59.910 --> 03:01.440
Oh, now that you mention it,

03:01.580 --> 03:04.850
l do remember you
saying something about that.

03:05.620 --> 03:08.050
No, no, no.
No, no, no, we didn't play paintball.

03:15.130 --> 03:17.960
What are pigeons eating nowadays?

03:18.470 --> 03:21.960
You guys are gonna scrub that terrace
until those bricks sparkle.

03:22.500 --> 03:23.560
Shiny bricks coming up.

03:24.610 --> 03:26.070
l'm so sorry.

03:26.470 --> 03:29.770
Your failing Spanish is all my fault.

03:31.050 --> 03:33.340
Okay. You're right. lt is your fault.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.320
- lt is?
- Of course it is.

03:39.450 --> 03:41.080
l'm going to call your Spanish teacher

03:41.220 --> 03:44.020
and tell her what a horrible role model
l've been.

03:45.290 --> 03:46.760
Here l am, a proud Latina,

03:46.890 --> 03:49.620
and l haven't been sharing
your Mexican heritage with you.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.930
l should be speaking Spanish
around the house

03:52.070 --> 03:54.300
and we should be making
our own homemade tortillas.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.770
Oh, my gosh, that's a lot of work.

03:59.010 --> 04:00.630
Let's just start with the Spanish, okay?

04:01.810 --> 04:03.800
Mrs. Chow.

04:05.910 --> 04:08.250
Thanks a lot, Alex.
You busted us for paintball.

04:08.380 --> 04:10.910
- Well, you busted me for failing Spanish.
- l'm done with you.

04:11.050 --> 04:12.380
Justin--

04:12.520 --> 04:14.150
Done.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.220
Yes, it is embarrassing.

04:17.790 --> 04:21.060
Thank you. l mean, gracias,

04:23.100 --> 04:26.290
Good news!
Mrs. Chow said she'd give you a re-test.

04:26.430 --> 04:29.270
Great. You're not going anywhere
with your friends

04:29.400 --> 04:31.000
until you get your grades up.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.130
Jerry, this is my responsibility.

04:33.270 --> 04:36.370
Don't worry, honey,
l'm gonna help you with your español,

04:36.510 --> 04:39.670
Okay, that's fine,
but l really need help with my Spanish too.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.150
Español is Spanish.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.170
Español is Spanish for what?

04:46.690 --> 04:47.750
This is gonna be hard.

04:49.320 --> 04:50.690
No, it's not. lt'll be easy.

04:50.830 --> 04:53.660
We're gonna whip through this
and l'm gonna go on my date with Riley.

04:53.790 --> 04:56.190
Two days to learn a whole language?

04:56.330 --> 05:00.060
l got some Spanish for you:
No way, José.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.900
José.

05:07.340 --> 05:11.300
And finally, did you guys know
that in the magic world,

05:11.450 --> 05:14.940
there's a place you can get information
on any subject quickly and easily?

05:15.080 --> 05:16.810
You mean like the lnternet?

05:16.950 --> 05:20.480
Speaking of the lnternet, when am l
getting a computer in my room?

05:20.620 --> 05:23.520
lt's cooler than the lnternet, and never.

05:24.830 --> 05:25.950
Come on, guys. Come on.

05:28.100 --> 05:29.620
Check it out.

05:29.760 --> 05:33.000
You just pull this lever
and it generates Pocket Elves

05:33.130 --> 05:35.070
that have in-depth knowledge
on any subject

05:35.200 --> 05:36.970
you could ever need to know about.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.600
You just pull it,
and whatever Pocket Elf you want,

05:39.740 --> 05:43.940
it comes shooting out
of the magic portal, huh?

05:45.550 --> 05:46.980
Okay.

05:55.960 --> 05:57.620
Awesome.

05:58.330 --> 05:59.690
All right. Well, there you go.

05:59.830 --> 06:01.850
You've got a wealth of knowledge
at your fingertips

06:02.000 --> 06:04.120
and you played a fun game of catch.

06:05.300 --> 06:06.660
Come on, guys.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.960
The best way to teach you
about Pocket Elves

06:10.100 --> 06:13.070
is from a Pocket Elf himself.

06:13.210 --> 06:15.440
- Look at him.
- Oh, he's so cool.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.470
Thanks, l know.

06:19.610 --> 06:22.640
Good day, l am the Pocket Elf
who specializes in history

06:22.780 --> 06:24.340
and use of Pocket Elves.

06:24.490 --> 06:27.420
Now, Pocket Elves
are useful for research on everything

06:27.560 --> 06:30.220
from magical illnesses
to magical creatures.

06:30.360 --> 06:31.550
Any questions?

06:31.690 --> 06:34.660
Yes, little lady in the attractive hat.

06:35.200 --> 06:38.390
Are there Pocket Elves
for subjects non-magical?

06:38.870 --> 06:41.060
Because of the Magic World
Equal Opportunity Act,

06:41.200 --> 06:43.570
there are Pocket Elves on all subjects.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.100
Shaquille O'Neal.

06:45.240 --> 06:47.370
l know his Pocket Elf.

06:47.810 --> 06:51.110
He owes me an autographed shoe
that l'm going to be living in.

06:51.580 --> 06:54.740
Yes, boy with the '80s hair.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.470
How many Pocket Elves
can you check out at once?

06:57.620 --> 07:00.210
None. They're not library books.

07:01.490 --> 07:03.320
Can l have some of that?

07:03.690 --> 07:05.060
- Sure.
- No.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.020
Wait. Give me--

07:07.160 --> 07:08.420
lt's gonna blow!

07:08.560 --> 07:10.660
What are you doing?

07:11.170 --> 07:15.400
Oh, did l mention that Pocket Elves
are not supposed to have chocolate?

07:15.770 --> 07:17.100
What happens if he has chocolate?

07:17.240 --> 07:19.900
To you and me,
chocolate is a delicious treat

07:20.040 --> 07:22.410
often used to say sorry to a loved one.

07:22.540 --> 07:26.880
But to this little guy,
it's like lighting a fuse on a crazy bomb.

07:28.720 --> 07:32.410
Then let's set this baby off
and give him some chocolate.

07:32.550 --> 07:36.610
You know, in this controlled environment,
it might be helpful to the students

07:36.760 --> 07:39.090
if someone were to give me
some chocolate,

07:39.230 --> 07:41.250
purely for educational purposes.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.960
- Sure, yeah, come on.
- All right.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.860
For educational purposes, we'll do this.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.800
Honey, grab me that box.

07:48.940 --> 07:51.430
Legs up off the floor,
button your collars all the way up.

07:51.570 --> 07:53.060
No open-toed shoes, right?

07:53.210 --> 07:58.200
And whatever you do,
do not let a Pocket Elf bite you.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.350
Before we get started, l just wanna say
thank you for the chocolate,

08:07.490 --> 08:10.420
and l'm really sorry
for what you're about to see.

08:17.630 --> 08:20.360
Hey, that's not supposed to happen.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.160
Proceed to an exit in an orderly fashion.

08:25.310 --> 08:27.740
- What's happening?
- Go. Go.

08:34.850 --> 08:37.510
Okay, let's review.

08:42.090 --> 08:43.820
Lampito.

08:46.490 --> 08:48.020
lt's okay.

08:52.830 --> 08:54.860
Cupito.

08:55.840 --> 08:59.000
Honey, just adding ''ito'' to a word
doesn't make it Spanish.

08:59.140 --> 09:01.870
You say ''como se dice'' before everything.
ls that Spanish?

09:02.540 --> 09:04.440
Oh, boy.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.810
Maybe you'll have to spend
the summers with Grandma.

09:06.950 --> 09:09.210
She does need help with the chickens.

09:10.820 --> 09:11.880
But my test is tomorrow.

09:12.020 --> 09:14.990
And if l don't pass, l won't be able
to go on my date with Riley on Friday.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.020
l know, honey.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.990
Maybe we can bake cookies on Friday.

09:26.230 --> 09:28.030
What are you thinking
about wearing on Friday?

09:28.170 --> 09:31.160
l think l'm gonna stick
with this whole fruit theme, you know?

09:31.310 --> 09:33.070
l don't want us to be wearing
the same thing.

09:33.210 --> 09:35.900
Oh, okay.
Well, you can wear it this time.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.980
And the time after that.

09:38.110 --> 09:40.770
We're set. And you've got
your Spanish re-test covered, right?

09:40.920 --> 09:44.440
l'm taking it right now during study hall.
Consider this test passito.

09:44.590 --> 09:46.820
Passito? Okay, see you later.

09:48.420 --> 09:50.750
Yeah, she won't be there.

09:53.190 --> 09:59.290
Señorita, you are so lucky to have me
as your Spanish-language Pocket Elf.

09:59.730 --> 10:02.000
Keep quiet, elf.
You're here to cheat on my Spanish test.

10:04.370 --> 10:05.740
Just stay in here and zip it.

10:08.540 --> 10:09.630
A journal.

10:09.780 --> 10:14.010
''Dear diary. Riley is such
a hottie with his new haircut.''

10:14.380 --> 10:16.210
Oops, my bad.

10:23.060 --> 10:26.190
Okay, wake up, señorito, We're home.

10:26.990 --> 10:29.190
Can l make you breakfast, Chiquita?

10:30.730 --> 10:34.000
Perhaps you can dine on that
while l enjoy some semi-sweet chocolate

10:34.130 --> 10:35.860
that you give me.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.130
Hey, your Spanish confuses me,
and l'm not giving you chocolate.

10:39.470 --> 10:42.240
Good. lt was a test, and you passed.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.740
That's why l want to grow old with you,
Chiquita,

10:45.880 --> 10:48.210
Dad, finished cleaning the bricks.

10:48.350 --> 10:49.940
You're not Dad.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.380
ls that a Pocket Elf?

10:51.520 --> 10:53.990
No. lt's my retainer case.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.250
You don't have a retainer.

10:55.390 --> 10:57.410
You don't know what goes in my mouth.

10:58.030 --> 11:01.430
And what a beautiful mouth it is,
señorita,

11:03.130 --> 11:06.730
Oh, so you're so good at Spanish, you
taught your retainer case how to speak it.

11:06.870 --> 11:08.200
Cheater.

11:08.340 --> 11:09.390
l didn't cheat. l just--

11:10.540 --> 11:11.940
Cheater.

11:12.670 --> 11:15.230
l just used the Pocket Elf
to get the answers right on the test.

11:15.380 --> 11:17.540
Okay, l cheated. So what?

11:17.910 --> 11:19.400
''So what'' is you're in trouble.

11:19.550 --> 11:21.280
Come on, Justin. Please don't tell Dad.

11:21.420 --> 11:23.010
Give me one good reason
why l shouldn't.

11:23.150 --> 11:26.140
You ratted me out for paintball.
l spent the last two days cleaning bricks

11:26.290 --> 11:28.650
and listening to Max sing ''Brick House.''

11:30.290 --> 11:31.950
You know what?

11:32.090 --> 11:33.250
l'm not gonna tell on you.

11:33.890 --> 11:35.690
- Thanks.
- l'm gonna get even.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.560
Yeah. Okay, that'll never happen.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.630
Remember the last time
you got even with me?

11:40.770 --> 11:43.000
l got the bigger bedroom,
and you got what?

11:43.940 --> 11:46.630
Shotgun on that one trip
to the outlet mall.

11:46.770 --> 11:48.710
Exactly. Some things never change.

11:58.490 --> 12:00.250
Guess who got an A
on her make-up test.

12:00.550 --> 12:03.460
Really? Oh, let me see that.

12:04.120 --> 12:07.060
Wow, you even got
your subjunctive conjugations.

12:07.190 --> 12:09.820
Oh, you know what the Spanish say...

12:12.400 --> 12:14.200
Hey, Dad. Guess what.

12:14.340 --> 12:17.360
l got an A on my make-up test,
and l'm gonna go on my date with Riley.

12:19.910 --> 12:23.040
l wasn't expecting this.
l'm very disappointed.

12:24.380 --> 12:25.640
That l passed?

12:26.350 --> 12:27.870
Yeah.

12:28.480 --> 12:33.250
Because now we have to have
the date talk.

12:33.890 --> 12:35.950
All right, here goes.

12:36.890 --> 12:40.350
A lot of times, when you're out alone
with a boy, he's thinking about--

12:40.490 --> 12:43.620
- Alone? We're not gonna be alone.
- You're not?

12:43.760 --> 12:45.990
No. Harper, Stacy, Jeff,
Cassandra, Terry, Samantha,

12:46.130 --> 12:48.260
Chris, Noah and Kelly will be there too.

12:48.940 --> 12:50.530
And you call that a date?

12:50.670 --> 12:52.870
That's not what l called a date
when l was a kid.

12:53.010 --> 12:54.940
What was a date when you were a kid?

12:57.680 --> 12:59.700
You know what? You're right.
That is a date.

13:06.890 --> 13:08.510
ls she still getting ready for her date?

13:08.660 --> 13:10.150
Yeah. And she's gonna be a while too.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.920
l tied all her belts in one big knot.

13:12.560 --> 13:13.990
Now this is getting even.

13:14.130 --> 13:15.860
When that Pocket Elf goes wild
on her date,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.460
she'll wish she was home
making us cookies.

13:19.330 --> 13:20.860
Here she comes.

13:26.140 --> 13:27.840
Oh, Justin got even with me.

13:27.980 --> 13:31.600
Tied all my belts together
so l'd be fashionably late for my date.

13:32.850 --> 13:35.110
Wow, you got me. You're so clever.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.740
Wow, l don't even know why l try.
You are too good for me.

13:38.890 --> 13:41.680
Well, at least you can relax,
there's nothing else to worry about.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.810
Yup, nothing's gonna go wrong
on your date

13:43.960 --> 13:47.260
as long as you take your purse and--

13:48.030 --> 13:49.550
All right, Dad, l'm leaving.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.250
Okay, honey.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.960
Have fun on your date.

13:55.770 --> 13:58.260
lt's so not a date.

14:05.180 --> 14:08.210
Welcome to Medium Rare. How many?

14:08.350 --> 14:11.510
Ten, but Lauren and Meg might come.
And if they do, Kelly will definitely leave.

14:11.650 --> 14:14.380
And if Kelly leaves,
Stacy will call Frances, who will show up.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.550
Which means l have to leave,
because we're fighting.

14:16.690 --> 14:17.990
How many is that?

14:18.130 --> 14:20.090
lt's either ten, 1 1 , 13 or 12.

14:21.300 --> 14:26.700
Follow me to your table
for ten, 1 1 , 13 or 12.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.570
So l heard you got
your learner's permit.

14:31.710 --> 14:33.570
- Oh, yeah, check it out.
- Yeah.

14:34.140 --> 14:37.510
Oh, that's a great picture of you.
But you know what would make it better?

14:37.640 --> 14:38.740
Me in it with you.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.540
Oh, l don't think they do that.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.710
You and Riley are so clicking.

14:44.850 --> 14:45.980
He's totally cool.

14:46.120 --> 14:49.180
And he can drive with a parent or guardian
during any daylight hour.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.890
This is great. l bet that elf went crazy,

14:53.030 --> 14:55.930
and Alex is flopping all over the floor,
looking as stupid as Dad did.

14:56.060 --> 14:57.890
She's gonna be so embarrassed.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.330
Yeah, we're geniuses.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.130
How much chocolate
did you put in her purse?

15:02.270 --> 15:03.760
About this much.

15:07.370 --> 15:09.570
l was supposed to put this chocolate
in her purse.

15:09.710 --> 15:11.910
That was your only part of the plan,
genius.

15:12.050 --> 15:14.780
l told you not to trust me
with a complicated plan like this.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.440
What's so complicated
about putting that chocolate in her purse?

15:17.580 --> 15:20.380
That l had to remember
to put this chocolate in her purse.

15:20.890 --> 15:21.950
Look.

15:22.090 --> 15:25.530
We gotta get to that restaurant
and get that chocolate in her purse.

15:27.830 --> 15:29.350
l was thinking, when l get my car,

15:29.500 --> 15:33.260
l'm gonna get a little license-plate
keychain with your name on it.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.800
- ls that cool?
- l guess, if you want.

15:36.740 --> 15:39.800
Harper, did you hear that?
He's gonna put my name on his keychain.

15:40.170 --> 15:41.440
l'm gonna cry.

15:41.580 --> 15:42.670
l promised l wouldn't cry.

15:45.380 --> 15:47.710
There she is. Duck.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.140
Excuse me. What are you doing?

15:55.460 --> 15:58.390
Trying to figure out
how to get chocolate into that purse.

15:58.530 --> 16:01.360
- Why?
- To mess with our sister.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.460
l have a sister.

16:03.860 --> 16:05.330
Get in.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.440
Why did that just shoot out
of her purse?

16:27.850 --> 16:29.340
Okay.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.290
As much as l want, l cannot.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.920
Oh, great.
We picked the one elf that's on a diet.

16:40.070 --> 16:42.130
Oh, come on, elf, eat it.

16:42.270 --> 16:44.460
You know you want to.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.180
Oh, this is good.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.980
Oh, this is really good.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.250
You guys probably wanna get away
from me right now.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.760
Home, Jeeves.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.730
- Alex, do you have any lip gloss?
- Let me look.

17:14.569 --> 17:16.700
Something bit me.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.270
What are you doing here?

17:24.410 --> 17:25.780
And why did you bite me?

17:25.910 --> 17:29.140
l'm eating chocolate
like there's no tomorrow.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.720
And there may not be.

17:30.850 --> 17:34.650
And you can't have any,
You can't have any,

17:37.260 --> 17:38.950
l don't want any of your chocolate.

17:39.090 --> 17:41.030
Oh, you will, baby.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.560
You're gonna love it.

17:46.170 --> 17:47.960
lt didn't go crazy. lt just bit her.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.730
Oh, that's bunk.

17:49.870 --> 17:52.810
l wanna get my ride in midnight blue.

17:52.940 --> 17:54.840
Oh, yeah,
that would look great with my eyes.

17:54.980 --> 17:56.570
- Can l have a bite of that?
- Sure.

17:57.380 --> 17:58.470
What color interior?

17:58.610 --> 18:01.380
- l'm thinking tan leather.
- l'm more of a dark leather person.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.150
Can l have that?

18:03.280 --> 18:04.410
Okay, sure.

18:06.350 --> 18:08.950
You know what's not a good color combo?
Our school colors.

18:09.090 --> 18:11.560
Blue and gold.
That's why l'm not a cheerleader.

18:11.990 --> 18:13.220
Besides, l'm not self-centered.

18:13.360 --> 18:17.090
l should start a school petition to change
our colors to midnight blue and chocolate.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.160
Oh, wait, that's not a straw.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.190
That's an interesting story.

18:25.340 --> 18:27.070
Hold that thought.

18:27.970 --> 18:29.670
You were saying?

18:32.650 --> 18:39.520
l wanna get the tires for my ride
bigger in the back and smaller in the front.

18:39.650 --> 18:41.350
lt's called chopper style.

18:42.220 --> 18:43.780
Oh, l hope it doesn't run on chocolate.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.920
That would be a waste of chocolate.

18:47.930 --> 18:49.400
Happy anniversary, you guys.

18:49.530 --> 18:52.000
l knew you two would work out.
l love you guys.

18:52.130 --> 18:53.830
Can l have some?

19:15.020 --> 19:16.960
Oh, wait, l want that.

19:18.330 --> 19:20.120
ls she okay?

19:20.990 --> 19:23.550
You know us girls.
Gotta have our chocolate.

19:26.830 --> 19:28.890
Now we're talking.

19:48.620 --> 19:51.320
Does anyone know the chocolate slide?

19:58.130 --> 19:59.620
Revenge is sweet.

19:59.770 --> 20:01.170
And sticky.

20:14.010 --> 20:15.880
That was fun.
What a nice break from chocolate.

20:16.020 --> 20:18.140
Chocolate sounds good right now.

20:19.490 --> 20:25.820
Listen, l just ordered the nachos,
so l think 10's good.

20:25.960 --> 20:29.660
She had a really nice time and she
totally wants to go out with you again.

20:36.440 --> 20:39.100
- You want me to call your parents?
- That would be terrific.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.170
l think they should see this.

20:41.310 --> 20:44.470
And we had nothing to do with it.

20:54.390 --> 20:56.010
And how long did you think
it was gonna be

20:56.160 --> 20:58.090
before we figured out
you didn't know Spanish?

20:58.230 --> 21:01.160
l really only needed you to think it
till the date was over,

21:01.290 --> 21:02.990
so l'm good.

21:03.130 --> 21:05.530
No. You are not good.

21:05.670 --> 21:08.160
You almost exposed magic
to the real world.

21:08.300 --> 21:09.960
Yes, and l've already punished myself,

21:10.100 --> 21:12.260
because l embarrassed myself
in front of Riley

21:12.410 --> 21:14.810
and he probably
won't ever text me again.

21:14.940 --> 21:19.210
And the fact that you two were just
conveniently down at the restaurant.

21:19.350 --> 21:20.810
You had something to do with it.

21:20.950 --> 21:24.040
We were on our way to another place.

21:24.180 --> 21:25.980
We stopped there on our way home.

21:26.120 --> 21:29.580
- From where?
- From a place

21:29.720 --> 21:30.920
that Max knows the name of.

21:33.030 --> 21:34.150
Pass.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.190
What is going on here?

21:37.330 --> 21:38.660
Okay.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.290
Look, here's what happened.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.560
l called them
when things started to go wrong.

21:43.700 --> 21:46.140
They just came down to help.
lt's not their fault.

21:50.110 --> 21:52.040
Fine, for now.

21:52.180 --> 21:54.310
You, go hose off on the balcony.

21:54.450 --> 21:56.810
- Fine.
- And you two, clean up when she's done.

21:56.950 --> 21:58.440
We don't need ants.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.350
Alex.

22:04.260 --> 22:07.060
- Wow, thanks for not ratting us out.
- Don't thank me.

22:07.190 --> 22:10.650
l didn't rat you out because l'm gonna
get even for you guys getting even.

22:11.670 --> 22:14.660
Oh, no, her getting even
is way worse than telling.

22:15.970 --> 22:17.200
- Dad, it was us!
- We gave it!

22:17.640 --> 22:19.470
- We gave the elf chocolate!
- We did it.
