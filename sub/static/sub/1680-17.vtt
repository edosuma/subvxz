WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:01.460
Well, kids, here we are.

00:01.530 --> 00:02.800
We've arrived

00:02.860 --> 00:04.130
My 30th birthday.

00:04.130 --> 00:06.130
The long-awaited story of...

00:07.060 --> 00:08.560
...the goat.

00:09.030 --> 00:10.960
That week started just like any other.

00:10.960 --> 00:13.730
Barney woke up in some girl's bed.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.500
In my experience, the way this normally goes is,

00:19.500 --> 00:21.530
We lie here for a while,

00:21.600 --> 00:24.660
Make a little awkward chitchat.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.060
Check.

00:27.130 --> 00:30.400
Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery,

00:30.400 --> 00:31.600
Rocket test flight I've got to be at,

00:31.600 --> 00:34.400
Slip out of the apartment and never call you again.

00:34.460 --> 00:36.230
And later at the bar,

00:36.230 --> 00:37.530
You tell your good friend robin

00:37.530 --> 00:38.960
The story of your latest conquest,

00:38.960 --> 00:40.900
And she thinks to herself,

00:40.900 --> 00:44.030
"who is this sad,  self-loathing idiot

00:44.030 --> 00:46.430
Who climbed into bed with barney stinson?"

00:47.500 --> 00:50.460
Actually, you usually say that out loud.

00:53.830 --> 00:55.600
So...

00:56.130 --> 01:00.400
...i just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend

01:00.400 --> 01:01.260
And I just slept

01:01.330 --> 01:04.330
With my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.400
Best friend.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.930
Okay, here's the deal, barney.

01:09.930 --> 01:11.730
The second my feet touch the ground,

01:11.730 --> 01:13.600
This never happened.

01:14.100 --> 01:15.100
Okay.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.260
Wait.

01:16.260 --> 01:18.230
Right click, save as...

01:18.230 --> 01:21.160
Into the .bpeg folder, and okay.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.660
This never happened.

01:24.530 --> 01:26.300
It's a good plan.

01:26.600 --> 01:30.260
Now we go back to exactly the way things were before.

01:30.260 --> 01:30.830
Okay.

01:30.830 --> 01:31.530
Okay.

01:31.530 --> 01:32.760
Right.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.700
So, robin?

01:34.700 --> 01:36.130
Yes, barney?

01:36.200 --> 01:40.030
Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night?

01:54.000 --> 02:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:01.560 --> 02:03.830
Till june, and, um,

02:03.900 --> 02:05.260
Since you were never here to begin with,

02:05.330 --> 02:06.130
You won't be here when I get out.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.330
-Okay. -okay.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.860
This never happened.

02:12.530 --> 02:14.730
Never happened.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.630
Never... happened.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.030
But pretending it never happened

02:18.100 --> 02:19.300
Wouldn't be that easy.

02:19.360 --> 02:20.730
So, tell us,

02:20.800 --> 02:21.700
What was it like?

02:21.760 --> 02:22.800
What?

02:22.860 --> 02:24.060
penetrating that barrier.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.730
You and I are the first ones to hit it.

02:25.800 --> 02:26.860
Well, not the first ones,

02:26.930 --> 02:28.700
Certainly, but the first ones at this table.

02:28.760 --> 02:31.200
I... I...

02:31.260 --> 02:33.800
I'm... I'm...

02:33.860 --> 02:36.460
Although, I'm gonna be hitting it pretty soon.

02:36.460 --> 02:37.100
yeah, you are.

02:37.160 --> 02:40.130
Yeah, and when I hit it, I'm going to go nuts.

02:40.200 --> 02:43.730
It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.500
I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.000
What are you taking about?!

02:49.060 --> 02:50.100
The big three-oh.

02:50.100 --> 02:51.930
You know,My 30th birthday's this friday.

02:52.000 --> 02:52.860
Did you forget?

02:52.860 --> 02:55.100
What kind of friend is this guy?

02:55.160 --> 02:56.560
Ha-ha right.

02:56.630 --> 02:58.500
A great friend, by the way.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.000
The best.

03:00.060 --> 03:01.230
Is it my imagination,

03:01.300 --> 03:02.660
Or are these drinks getting smaller?

03:02.730 --> 03:05.960
If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, "try again."

03:07.830 --> 03:09.430
How you doing there, robin?

03:09.500 --> 03:11.700
-I'm good. -Oh, so, I made a a decision.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.400
I'm going to go through all my old stuff,

03:13.460 --> 03:16.000
And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore.

03:16.060 --> 03:17.230
Hmm.  barney, you want my xbox?

03:18.330 --> 03:20.030
Ted, she has a name!

03:20.100 --> 03:22.500
And just what are you accusing me of?

03:22.560 --> 03:24.600
Liking video games?

03:24.660 --> 03:25.600
I'm gonna get a drink.

03:25.660 --> 03:27.130
I'll come with you.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.030
Okay.

03:28.100 --> 03:29.330
God, this is awkward.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.760
What is?

03:30.830 --> 03:32.160
Being around ted.

03:32.230 --> 03:33.260
Why?

03:33.330 --> 03:35.600
-Because of our thing.-what thing?

03:35.660 --> 03:37.430
You're really gonna pretend this never happened?

03:37.430 --> 03:39.460
What never happened?

03:41.800 --> 03:43.300
What are you guys talking about?

03:43.360 --> 03:45.300
Nothing.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.130
Guys, cut the act. I know.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.230
I know about the surprise party you guys are throwing me.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.100
Marshall let it slip earlier today.

03:55.130 --> 03:56.760
Hey, I'll totally act surprised and everything.

03:56.830 --> 03:58.200
Just be sure to invite stella.

03:58.260 --> 03:59.760
Stella!

03:59.830 --> 04:01.500
You have a serious girlfriend now!

04:01.560 --> 04:03.000
You're over this one.

04:03.060 --> 04:04.760
Robin who, right?

04:04.830 --> 04:06.500
Stella makes this one look

04:06.560 --> 04:09.000
Like a filthy bag of gbabage, am I right?

04:10.530 --> 04:11.830
Happy birthday, bro.

04:16.630 --> 04:17.760
Hello.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.360
Hey, marshall, I need your help.

04:20.430 --> 04:22.730
Yeah, I'm kind of real focused on the job hunt right now.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.860
I know. I want to hire you.

04:24.930 --> 04:27.900
For the last time, barney, I will not be your butler.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.560
I need a lawyer.

04:29.630 --> 04:31.100
I'll pay you.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.800
How much?

04:32.860 --> 04:34.000
A little.

04:34.060 --> 04:36.260
I'll take it.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.960
Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say,

04:41.960 --> 04:43.630
This might be a little bit over my head.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.930
For one thing, I'm fairly certain

04:46.000 --> 04:47.960
That if these contracts aren't executed precisely,

04:48.030 --> 04:50.960
We will be at war with portugal.

04:51.030 --> 04:52.130
Forget that.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.460
That's a tuesday for me.

04:54.760 --> 04:55.960
New shredder.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.630
This baby'll chew up a bicycle in 17 seconds.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.500
From sky mall.it's all from sky mall.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.330
Whenever I get upset, I shop at sky mall.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.930
-Want a hot dog? -of course.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.630
Why are you upset?

05:08.700 --> 05:11.030
Marshall, I'm about to tell you a secret

05:11.100 --> 05:13.030
That you can't tell anyone-- not ted,

05:13.100 --> 05:15.060
Not robin, not lily.

05:15.130 --> 05:18.230
No. no, no, no,  I don't want any more secrets,

05:18.300 --> 05:20.060
Especially now that I know what you guys did

05:20.130 --> 05:22.060
To the drinking water in lisbon. i...

05:22.130 --> 05:24.360
You are hearing this secret, marshall.

05:24.430 --> 05:26.430
I... I slept...

05:26.500 --> 05:29.030
Stop..stop doing that.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.160
I slept...

05:34.030 --> 05:35.100
I slept with robin.

05:36.060 --> 05:38.530
You slept with robin?

05:46.660 --> 05:47.860
Are you mad at me?

05:47.930 --> 05:50.400
I don't know.

05:50.460 --> 05:52.030
How's the hot dog?

05:52.100 --> 05:53.500
It's helping.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.730
You slept with robin?!

05:55.800 --> 05:57.160
I... I cannot keep that secret.

05:57.160 --> 05:57.960
I mean, you know

05:57.960 --> 05:58.830
I at least have to tell lily.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.130
You can't. you can't tell anyone.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.900
Attorney-client privilege.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.960
Why are you doing this to me?!

06:03.960 --> 06:06.460
Because I need you, Marshall, as my lawyer,

06:06.460 --> 06:08.300
to prove that I didn't do anying wrong.

06:08.360 --> 06:10.400
How can I help you as your lawyer?

06:10.460 --> 06:12.830
You didn't break any laws, did you?

06:12.900 --> 06:16.900
Robin knows you slept with her, doesn't she?

06:17.100 --> 06:19.560
I didn't break any state or federal laws,

06:19.630 --> 06:23.130
but I think I broke a much, much higher law.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.860
The Bro Code.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.460
<i>For many years,</i>

06:28.530 --> 06:30.200
we had heard Barney <i>quote the Bro Code,</i>

06:30.260 --> 06:32.730
<i>a list of do's</i><i> and don'ts for all bros.</i>

06:32.800 --> 06:34.160
<i>Some were basic.</i>

06:34.300 --> 06:37.330
Bro Code article one:"Bros before hoes.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.700
<i>Some were unbelievably</i><i> complicated.</i>

06:39.760 --> 06:42.030
Bro Code article 89:

06:42.100 --> 06:44.300
"The mom of a bro is always off limits,

06:44.360 --> 06:48.600
"but the stepmom of a bro is fair game if she initiates it,

06:48.660 --> 06:50.260
"and/or is wearing at least one a article

06:50.330 --> 06:52.130
of leopard print clothing."

06:52.200 --> 06:54.000
<i>And some were</i><i>just plain disturbing.</i>

06:54.060 --> 06:56.360
Bro Code article 34:

06:56.430 --> 07:00.530
"Bros cannot make eye contact during a devil's three-way."

07:01.800 --> 07:02.960
Two dudes.

07:04.830 --> 07:07.200
This is not a legal docume..

07:07.260 --> 07:08.530
This is just something you wrote.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.800
You think I wrote that?

07:10.860 --> 07:12.360
Oh, Marshall,

07:12.430 --> 07:16.930
don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.260
<i>The year was 1776.</i>

07:19.330 --> 07:21.230
<i>The place: Philadelphia.</i>

07:21.300 --> 07:24.030
Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were hangng a drink.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.960
But, bro, seriously,

07:26.030 --> 07:28.400
I called the dibs on that wench.

07:28.460 --> 07:31.400
You codpiece blocked me.

07:31.460 --> 07:32.600
So what if I did?

07:32.660 --> 07:33.830
There's no rule against it.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.130
Well, there should be.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.130
There should be a set of rules that govern

07:37.200 --> 07:39.600
the way bros comport themselves among other bros.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.630
But who shall write such a document?

07:41.700 --> 07:45.560
I have to go to Me, D.C.,and pose for the dollar bill.

07:45.630 --> 07:48.160
And I have to do some kite-flying or setething.

07:48.230 --> 07:49.900
I shall write this set of rules.

07:49.960 --> 07:53.260
And I shall inscribe it on theacack of the Constitution.

07:53.330 --> 07:55.760
 To save paper.

07:55.830 --> 07:56.960
It's resolved!

07:57.030 --> 07:58.660
Barney Stinson shall write...

07:58.730 --> 08:00.700
the Bro Code.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.800
And I shl l include a provision

08:03.860 --> 08:06.960
that stateth no eye contact in a devil's three-way.

08:07.030 --> 08:08.000
-Seconded. -Seconded.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.200
Listen, what do you want me for? 

08:13.260 --> 08:14.730
I've just been losing my mind lately,

08:14.730 --> 08:16.430
and do you know why I feel so bad?

08:16.500 --> 08:17.860
Yeah, because you slept with Robin.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.260
No, that was awesome.

08:20.560 --> 08:21.730
I feel bad

08:21.800 --> 08:23.730
because the Bro Code  clearly states

08:23.800 --> 08:25.660
"No sex with your bro's ex."

08:25.730 --> 08:27.230
But if you,

08:27.300 --> 08:30.030
my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere,

08:30.100 --> 08:32.130
then that bad feeling will go bye-bye.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.860
And you would pay me for that?

08:34.929 --> 08:37.100
No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork.

08:37.159 --> 08:40.000
Technically, you'll be paid  by a toy factory in Pyongyang.

08:40.059 --> 08:42.130
Barney, I'm no shrink, okay,

08:42.200 --> 08:44.600
but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you

08:44.660 --> 08:47.660
to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted?

08:47.730 --> 08:49.530
Hey, if I wanted a psychological evaluation,

08:49.600 --> 08:51.330
I'd hire the guy we pay

08:51.400 --> 08:52.700
to hint notize us before depositions.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.430
Now, get cracking!

08:54.500 --> 08:56.630
<i>While Marshall examined</i>  <i> the Bro Code,</i>

08:56.700 --> 08:58.730
<i>Lily's kindergarten class welcomed a special guest.</i>

08:58.800 --> 09:01.660
And with a little luck, in a few days,

09:01.730 --> 09:03.730
Farmer Frank's cold will be all gone.

09:03.800 --> 09:07.360
And that's why Farmer Frank's breath smells like medicine.

09:07.430 --> 09:09.100
Right, Farmer Frank?

09:09.160 --> 09:10.760
You got it, toots.

09:10.830 --> 09:13.730
Any last questions  for Farmer Frank? Yes.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.560
Will we ever go to see Missy the Goat again?

09:16.630 --> 09:18.130
Oh! Ah, isn't  that sweet!

09:18.200 --> 09:19.360
Well, you know, honey,

09:19.430 --> 09:20.960
right after this,

09:21.030 --> 09:23.400
I'm gonna drop old Missy off at the butcher shop.

09:23.460 --> 09:24.560
 And they're going to take

09:24.630 --> 09:26.730
a great big knife...

09:26.800 --> 09:29.260
<i>And Frank went on to traumatize Lily's entire class</i>

09:29.330 --> 09:31.400
with a graphic explanation of where meat comes from..

09:31.460 --> 09:35.600
So not one little scrap of Missy goes to waste.

09:35.660 --> 09:39.400
Ms. Aldrin, please don't let emem eat Missy.

09:47.700 --> 09:49.130
I know, I know.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.700
I already called an animal rescue,

09:51.760 --> 09:53.800
and they're going to come get her on Monday.

09:53.860 --> 09:56.060
Monday?! Where's she going to sleep and eat

09:56.130 --> 09:58.100
and go to the bathroom?!

09:59.700 --> 10:02.900
Okay, where's she going to sleep and eat?

10:02.960 --> 10:05.330
I-I guess  I'll keep her up on the roof.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.960
Look, call me crazy. I just...

10:07.030 --> 10:09.860
I don't think having a goat in the apartment is a good idea.

10:09.930 --> 10:12.260
And, boy, was I right,because what Missy the Goat

10:12.330 --> 10:15.400
would go on to do in that bathroom was so...

10:15.460 --> 10:16.530
<i>No, you know what?</i>

10:16.600 --> 10:18.600
<i>I'm m getting ahead of myself.</i>

10:18.660 --> 10:20.130
<i>We'll get there.</i>

10:20.200 --> 10:21.430
Hey, Ted.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.130
   You ready to, um...

10:24.200 --> 10:25.700
Where'd the goat turd come from?

10:25.760 --> 10:27.660
How'd you know  that was a goat turd?

10:27.730 --> 10:28.960
Well, it was either that,

10:29.030 --> 10:31.000
or a musk ox turd,

10:31.060 --> 10:33.460
and I figured,what the hell would a musk ox be doing in here?

10:33.530 --> 10:36.600
Hey. Guess what your wife brought home.

10:36.660 --> 10:38.330
Attorney-client privilege.I can't talk about it.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.500
Talk about what?

10:39.560 --> 10:40.960
Nothing.

10:41.030 --> 10:42.500
How was your day?

10:42.560 --> 10:44.460
Oh, goat turd on the floor,I see. Is that new?

10:46.960 --> 10:49.760
How does everyone know that's a goat turd?

10:52.730 --> 10:54.260
-Barney told you. -I don't know  what you're talking about,madam. 

10:54.330 --> 10:56.330
Marshall,

10:56.400 --> 10:58.330
you can't look me in the eye, you're blushing,

10:58.400 --> 10:59.460
coughing,

10:59.530 --> 11:00.760
and your hands are shaking.

11:00.830 --> 11:02.500
come here.

11:02.560 --> 11:05.330
Ted is never finding out about this, you understand?

11:05.400 --> 11:08.230
Because it never happened, none of us are saying anything.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.900
And don't even think about opening that can

11:09.960 --> 11:12.030
until I'm out of the splash zone.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.260
fantastic, you're here.

11:27.330 --> 11:29.130
Give me the good news.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.760
I'm sorry.

11:30.830 --> 11:31.900
You did too good of a job writing this thing.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.600
It's-it's iron-clad.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.260
No!

11:35.330 --> 11:36.360
Bad lawyer!

11:36.430 --> 11:38.260
I need a loophole!

11:38.330 --> 11:40.160
I want to feel better, Marshall!

11:40.230 --> 11:41.960
I can't keep buying things!

11:42.030 --> 11:44.600
I have six self-cleaning litterboxes

11:44.660 --> 11:46.030
and I don't even have a kid.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.160
Wait. How about this?

11:48.230 --> 11:50.500
Ted's probably broken this thing himself, right?

11:50.560 --> 11:52.430
And if he's broken the Bro Code,

11:52.500 --> 11:53.600
then I'm off the hook.

11:53.660 --> 11:54.760
I thought about that.

11:54.830 --> 11:56.760
And I gotta say,

11:56.830 --> 11:59.160
Ted has upheld this thing time and time again.

11:59.230 --> 12:00.700
For example,  article 87:

12:00.760 --> 12:04.430
"A bro shall at all times say yes."

12:04.500 --> 12:06.860
So he saved you from an avalanche?

12:06.930 --> 12:08.530
Yes.

12:08.600 --> 12:12.130
And he carried you six miles to safety on his broken leg?

12:12.200 --> 12:13.400
Yes.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.860
And you're a pre-op transsexual nightclub singer

12:15.930 --> 12:18.230
who used to be a member of the Russian mob?

12:22.330 --> 12:24.260
Da.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.830
Article 29

12:25.900 --> 12:28.930
"A bro will in a timely manner alert his bro

12:29.000 --> 12:30.600
to the existence of a girl fight."

12:30.660 --> 12:33.200
Dude, two girls are fighting  at MacLaren's.

12:33.260 --> 12:35.930
What?!

12:38.160 --> 12:39.500
Yeah, yeah.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.100
It was crazy. This one girl was like...

12:41.160 --> 12:42.460
Oh, hey.

12:42.530 --> 12:44.230
Hey.

12:44.300 --> 12:45.600
Article 53:

12:45.660 --> 12:47.960
"A bro will, whenever possible,

12:48.030 --> 12:50.030
provide his bro with protection."

12:50.100 --> 12:52.000
That feels nice.

12:52.060 --> 12:54.000
Good.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.400
I just wish we had some wine.

13:02.460 --> 13:03.730
Yeah.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.160
I wish we had  some wine, too.

13:11.430 --> 13:12.860
damn it, Marshall.

13:12.930 --> 13:14.860
I'm not paying you to tell me what a saint Ted is!

13:14.930 --> 13:15.800
You're my lawyer!

13:15.860 --> 13:18.000
The answer is in there! Find it!

13:18.060 --> 13:20.060
Okay, this isn't about the Bro Code, and you know it.

13:20.130 --> 13:23.200
The reason that you're upset is because what you did was wrong.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.530
And the only way you're ever gonna feel

13:24.600 --> 13:27.300
any better about it is  if you tell Ted what you did.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.700
What if he never wants to talk to me again?

13:29.760 --> 13:31.530
Well, I guess that's just a chance

13:31.600 --> 13:33.330
you're gonna have to take.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.460
Which brings us to April 25, 2008.

13:36.530 --> 13:38.230
My 30th birthday,

13:38.300 --> 13:40.930
or as it would come to be referred to in later years:

13:41.000 --> 13:42.630
The Day of the Goat.

13:42.700 --> 13:43.960
Hey, where are you?

13:44.030 --> 13:45.530
I'm in the limo,  right outside ofeded's office.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.830
Great. Well, everyone's here.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.300
Stella just arrived

13:48.360 --> 13:50.630
and there is something here so awesome,

13:50.700 --> 13:53.460
I'm not going to tell you what it is, but you won't believe...

13:53.530 --> 13:54.500
Goat in a party hat?

13:54.560 --> 13:55.660
Damn it!

13:55.730 --> 13:58.000
Well, you still gotta see it.

13:58.060 --> 14:00.660
It's so much fun having a goat at a party!

14:00.730 --> 14:02.000
In a few short hours,

14:02.060 --> 14:03.960
Lily would come to regret those words.

14:04.860 --> 14:06.100
But we'll get there.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.860
Uh, gotta go. Here he comes.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.000
Okay. Bye.

14:10.760 --> 14:13.100
Whoa, you guys went all out.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.160
Okay, everyone, Ted's in the limo, five-minute warning!

14:15.230 --> 14:16.260
Everyone get ready!

14:16.330 --> 14:19.460
Oh, Missy, are you excit??

14:21.100 --> 14:22.830
Yes, you are!

14:25.030 --> 14:26.560
Whoa, we're leaving the city.

14:26.630 --> 14:27.630
Where the hell is this party?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.460
Vegas.

14:34.860 --> 14:36.700
Vegas? I thought the party  was on the rooftop.

14:36.760 --> 14:37.430
Surprise!

14:37.500 --> 14:38.900
Just a decoy, my friend.

14:39.030 --> 14:40.430
So there's no roof party?

14:40.500 --> 14:41.630
Oh, no. There is.  We're just not going.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.530
This is how good a friend I am.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.900
They want you to spent your 30th standing around

14:45.960 --> 14:47.960
drinking flat beer ten feet above your living room.

14:48.030 --> 14:49.330
But not me, bro.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.230
I pulled out all the stops.

14:51.300 --> 14:54.660
Private jet, Valderrama suite at the Bellagio.

14:54.730 --> 14:56.300
Steaks at BOA,

14:56.360 --> 15:00.000
scotch at Ghostbar, then two ringside seats

15:00.060 --> 15:02.100
to watch Floyd Mayatather go ten rounds with,

15:02.160 --> 15:03.260
wait for it...

15:03.330 --> 15:04.400
a grizzly bear!

15:04.460 --> 15:07.000
Take me home, Barney.

15:07.060 --> 15:08.030
No!

15:08.100 --> 15:09.630
We have to go to Vegas.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.300
Look, Ted, I didn't want to say this, but...

15:14.360 --> 15:15.660
there's something that I have to tell you,

15:15.730 --> 15:17.430
and I wanted you to be

15:17.500 --> 15:19.300
in the best possible frame of mind before you heard it.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.400
You slept with Robin.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.330
You slept with Robin?

15:26.400 --> 15:30.130
Barney! That is Ted's ex-girlfriend!

15:36.730 --> 15:38.200
When did you find out?

15:39.460 --> 15:40.830
Hey, Robin. Come here!

15:40.900 --> 15:42.560
What's up?

15:42.630 --> 15:45.100
I was, uh, just going through some old stuff

15:45.160 --> 15:47.130
-and I... -Oh, crap!

15:49.930 --> 15:51.530
Anyway, uh,

15:51.600 --> 15:52.960
I came across this.

15:54.960 --> 15:56.660
-From my vacacation in Vermont. -Yeah.

15:56.730 --> 15:58.630
I don't know if you'd even want it, but if you do, it's yours.

15:58.700 --> 16:00.130
I slept with Barney!

16:00.200 --> 16:01.560
What?

16:01.630 --> 16:03.300
It was just one time,

16:03.360 --> 16:05.560
it, it was the night that Simon dumped me

16:05.630 --> 16:07.300
and I was in a really vulnerable place

16:07.360 --> 16:10.430
and I, I wand d to just pretend like it never happened,

16:10.500 --> 16:12.300
but I couldn't, and...

16:12.360 --> 16:14.030
I can't.

16:14.100 --> 16:17.300
I just, I had to tell you.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.930
And...

16:19.000 --> 16:21.800
I just hope that we can still be friends.

16:21.860 --> 16:24.460
Of course we can still be friends.

16:24.530 --> 16:26.130
So you're not mad?

16:26.200 --> 16:27.830
Well, I'm...

16:27.900 --> 16:29.830
it's a little weird, but, um,

16:29.900 --> 16:31.960
No, I'm not mad.

16:37.900 --> 16:38.660
So you're not mad?

16:38.730 --> 16:40.930
No, I'm not mad.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.960
I mean, Robin and I broke up a year ago.

16:43.030 --> 16:45.330
We've, we've both dated lots of people since then.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.700
I'm with Stella now.

16:48.060 --> 16:49.630
Seriously, I...I'm fine with this.

16:50.930 --> 16:52.860
I'm so relieved to hear you say that.

16:52.930 --> 16:54.700
Yeah. Yeah.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.460
Oh, hey, I just remembered, um,

16:56.530 --> 16:58.530
my mom is coming into town next month.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.960
Maybe you'd like to nail her, too!

17:01.030 --> 17:03.000
Where are they?! I'm getting a cramp.

17:03.060 --> 17:06.160
Marshall, can we keep the goat?

17:06.230 --> 17:07.900
No.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.859
-But she's so cute and furry and soft. -Yeah,

17:09.930 --> 17:11.730
and she also sheds, eats out of the garbage

17:11.800 --> 17:12.859
and can't control her bobowels.

17:12.930 --> 17:14.500
Why don't we just call Duluth Mental Hospital

17:14.560 --> 17:16.800
and say my Uncle Linus can live with us?

17:16.859 --> 17:18.530
Yeah, Lily, that may seem like a good idea

17:18.599 --> 17:20.329
after a couple of drinks but tomorrow morning

17:20.400 --> 17:22.060
you're going to want this thing out of your house.

17:22.130 --> 17:24.200
Oh, you should talk.You slept with Barney.

17:24.260 --> 17:24.900
Marshall!

17:24.960 --> 17:25.930
I'm sorry!

17:26.000 --> 17:27.300
I couldn't take it anymore.

17:27.359 --> 17:29.200
I can't believe  you did that.

17:29.260 --> 17:30.800
That's so gross.

17:30.860 --> 17:32.730
Was it amazing?

17:32.800 --> 17:34.430
What? I...

17:34.500 --> 17:36.460
Lily, I really don't want to talk about this.

17:36.530 --> 17:38.500
I know but it's Barney.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.200
It's just hard not to be curious.

17:41.530 --> 17:43.330
Did he have like devices and stuff?

17:43.400 --> 17:44.700
Lily,come on.

17:44.760 --> 17:45.930
-Hot wax? -Stop it.

17:46.000 --> 17:46.930
Did he tie you to anything?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.300
-That's enough.  -What's wrong with you?

17:48.360 --> 17:49.160
I'm sorry.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.560
Is he all smooth down there?

17:57.300 --> 17:59.660
Three billion women on the planet!

17:59.730 --> 18:01.630
Three billion!

18:01.700 --> 18:03.700
And you have to sleep with the one that I dated for a year!

18:03.760 --> 18:06.100
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?!

18:06.100 --> 18:06.400
Robin?!

18:06.460 --> 18:07.960
You think I'm proud of this?!

18:08.030 --> 18:09.830
I'm horrified that this happened.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.260
How did it happen? Huh?

18:11.330 --> 18:12.730
Barney, I want to know.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.900
Tell me exactly how it happened.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.760
You mean...

18:16.830 --> 18:18.360
what position?

18:19.000 --> 18:19.330
Okay.

18:19.400 --> 18:19.930
Stop it!

18:20.000 --> 18:21.260
Stop it!

18:21.330 --> 18:22.760
Stop it.

18:22.830 --> 18:22.900
-Hit him! Hit him, -Ted! Stop!

18:24.000 --> 18:25.360
-Hit him! -Stop!

18:25.430 --> 18:26.300
-Hit him! -Okay.

18:26.360 --> 18:27.800
Okay. Okay.

18:27.860 --> 18:29.130
You're pissed.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.260
You deserve to be.

18:30.330 --> 18:31.300
Fine. You know what?

18:31.360 --> 18:33.300
One free shot. On me.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.900
Anywhere but the face.

18:39.700 --> 18:42.960
Who punches someone in the groin?

18:44.900 --> 18:46.030
Okay.Okay.

18:46.100 --> 18:47.200
I deserved that.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.660
I deserved that.

18:49.730 --> 18:51.700
But what's important now is...

18:51.760 --> 18:54.960
we're passed this whole Robin thing now, right?

18:55.030 --> 18:56.960
You think that this is just about Robin?

18:57.030 --> 18:58.600
This is about...

19:00.160 --> 19:02.100
You know, I've seen you do some bad stuff.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.500
I mean some really terrible stuff

19:04.560 --> 19:06.030
to a lot of different people.

19:06.100 --> 19:08.230
I just always thought there had to be a limit.

19:08.300 --> 19:10.460
I always thought I was the limit.

19:10.530 --> 19:14.860
You're always spouting off  these rules for bros.

19:14.860 --> 19:17.100
Isn't one of them, "don't do this"?

19:17.160 --> 19:19.400
Yeah. And I broke it.

19:19.460 --> 19:21.260
I'm sorry.

19:22.630 --> 19:23.760
But, Ted...

19:25.260 --> 19:27.260
...seriously, this suite at the Bellagio...

19:27.330 --> 19:29.500
I am not going to Vegas with you!

19:29.560 --> 19:30.960
I'm not going to blow off my friends

19:31.030 --> 19:32.760
and my girlfriend,

19:32.860 --> 19:35.230
and spend my 30th birthday in a strip club.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.130
The fact that you think I would...

19:38.830 --> 19:40.700
You know, Barney,earlier this week 

19:40.760 --> 19:42.400
I started putting things in a box

19:42.460 --> 19:45.330
and that box was labeled "stuff I have no use for anymore."

19:45.400 --> 19:47.260
What does that mean?

19:47.330 --> 19:49.130
It means...

19:49.200 --> 19:51.200
maybe you belong in that box.

19:53.300 --> 19:55.130
Are you saying you dnon't want to be bros anymore?

19:55.200 --> 19:58.600
I'm saying I don't want to be friends anymore.

20:00.130 --> 20:02.600
Okay, I'm going to stop you right there,

20:02.660 --> 20:05.300
because it seems like you're about to say something

20:05.360 --> 20:07.000
that's going to pretty much ruin Vegas.

20:07.060 --> 20:08.660
Ranjit, stop the car.

20:10.100 --> 20:12.030
I'm getting a cab.

20:48.430 --> 20:51.000
Surprise!

20:58.500 --> 21:00.130
<i>Oh, right, the goat.</i>

21:00.200 --> 21:01.600
<i>So funny.You're going to love this.</i>

21:01.660 --> 21:04.700
So later in that night, the goat locked himself in the bathroom

21:04.830 --> 21:06.600
and was eating one <i>of Robin's washcloths and</i>

21:06.660 --> 21:08.230
<i>wait, hold on.</i>

21:08.300 --> 21:10.160
Robin wasn't living here <i> on my 30th birthday.</i>

21:10.230 --> 21:11.560
<i>When did this happen?</i>

21:11.630 --> 21:14.930
Oh, wait, the goat was there <i> on my 31st birthday.</i>

21:15.000 --> 21:16.760
Sorry,<i>I totally got that wrong.</i>
