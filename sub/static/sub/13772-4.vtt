killed himself.

That's where the

in a pile right there.

in my teeth.

those pirates are a lot tougher

06:38.223 --> 06:39.616
But if he didn't
steal from us,

06:39.703 --> 06:40.922
he'd just be stealing
from somewhere else,

If you had a real ax
in your head,

you wouldn't be laughing.

09:33.007 --> 09:35.052
Okay.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.577
Do you feel safe?

09:37.664 --> 09:39.143
[ sighs]

09:39.230 --> 09:41.058
Dad, I know the murders
were sick and creepy,

09:41.145 --> 09:42.886
but they happened
20 years ago.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.366
And they don't bother you
at all?

09:44.453 --> 09:45.628
No.

09:45.715 --> 09:46.934
I mean, the
murderer's dead

09:47.021 --> 09:48.675
so it's not like
he's coming back.

09:48.762 --> 09:49.937
Right.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.329
[ chuckles]

09:51.416 --> 09:53.941
Right, I mean,
that would be... crazy.

09:54.028 --> 09:57.988
Dad, you don't believe
in ghosts, do you?

09:58.075 --> 09:59.903
-Malcolm, please.
-Do you?

09:59.990 --> 10:02.297
Do you mean do I believe
in dead people

10:02.384 --> 10:04.908
floating around,
saying, "Ooooh!"

10:04.995 --> 10:07.128
Of course not.

10:07.215 --> 10:08.259
But, I mean, an energy,

10:08.346 --> 10:09.739
a life force,

10:09.826 --> 10:11.698
a soul that, upon death,
separates from the body

10:11.785 --> 10:13.830
and inhabits another plane,
crying out to the living

10:13.917 --> 10:16.137
in a horrific wail
of unbearable pain?

10:16.224 --> 10:17.704
-Oh, absolutely.
-Dad...

10:17.791 --> 10:20.097
You, yourself, told me
that string theory says

10:20.184 --> 10:21.795
there are 11 different
dimensions

10:21.882 --> 10:23.666
occupying the same space.

10:23.753 --> 10:25.799
-So?
-So, who's to say

10:25.886 --> 10:28.192
we can't be affected
by things we don't see?

10:28.279 --> 10:30.412
What science calls wormholes is

10:30.499 --> 10:33.197
actually matter and energy,
a life force

10:33.284 --> 10:36.331
mixed together in the cosmos.
Don't you see that?

10:36.418 --> 10:39.377
All of which points to one
stubborn, undeniable fact:

10:39.464 --> 10:42.206
that we are living
in a known portal for evil.

10:42.293 --> 10:44.165
And now that we know it,
and it knows we know it,

10:44.252 --> 10:45.601
of course it would
come back to kill us!

10:45.688 --> 10:47.342
And of course it would
come back tonight!

10:48.343 --> 10:50.040
You don't have much to say

10:50.127 --> 10:51.912
when your science comes back
at you, do you?

10:51.999 --> 10:54.828
[ door slams]

10:59.006 --> 11:00.268
Honey?

11:03.314 --> 11:04.576
Reese?

11:06.361 --> 11:07.797
Dewey?

11:10.234 --> 11:12.019
Burglar?

11:35.042 --> 11:38.306
[vent creaks, echoes]

11:38.393 --> 11:40.525
Was that or was that not
the sound of someone

11:40.612 --> 11:43.006
looking for his head?!

11:52.015 --> 11:55.932
But you said you'd send
a patrol car 20 minutes ago!

11:56.019 --> 11:58.021
Low priority?!

11:58.108 --> 12:00.458
It's still against the law
to steal, isn't it?

12:00.545 --> 12:03.287
Fine, fine. We'll be here.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.988
[ clicks]
Unbelievable.

12:08.075 --> 12:10.947
I get one break
from 7:00 to 7:20.

12:11.034 --> 12:12.775
That break is now over!

12:12.862 --> 12:15.691
Instead of spending it
with my adorable
little two-year-old son,

12:15.778 --> 12:16.953
I spend it with you!

12:17.040 --> 12:18.781
Lady, I have six warrants
for my arrest

12:18.868 --> 12:20.652
and I'm supposed
to feel sorry for you?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.393
Lois,

12:22.480 --> 12:23.917
I've been thinking
about it.

12:24.004 --> 12:25.440
I just want you
to know I'm sorry.

12:25.527 --> 12:27.616
I believe in you
and what you're doing here.

12:27.703 --> 12:29.139
You're doing
the right thing.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.488
Are you drunk?

12:30.575 --> 12:32.447
"Chilty as garged."

12:32.534 --> 12:33.970
Aren't you on the clock?

12:34.057 --> 12:36.233
But it's a party,
and they invited me,

12:36.320 --> 12:39.236
knowing full well that
being wanted is my kryptonite.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.151
Party? So they're all drinking
out there?

12:41.238 --> 12:43.066
WOMAN [ over P.A.]: Attention, Lucky Aide shoppers.

12:43.153 --> 12:46.156
Who's gonna come up here and
kiss me right now, damn it?

12:46.243 --> 12:48.985
Oh, my God!
No one cares about the rules!

12:49.072 --> 12:52.032
No one cares about lawbreakers!

12:52.119 --> 12:54.295
Fine! Why am I the only sap?

12:54.382 --> 12:57.777
Since it's complete anarchy,
I am taking my meal break early.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.257
That's right.
I'm overlapping with Joan!

13:01.650 --> 13:02.738
Look at that!

13:02.825 --> 13:04.740
I didn't even line it up right.

13:08.265 --> 13:09.876
So, do I get to go now?

13:09.963 --> 13:12.008
You think you've got some place
more fun than this?

13:12.095 --> 13:13.793
Go if you want.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.230
But a bunch of chips and dip
are about to get "damaged,"

13:16.317 --> 13:18.841
if you know what I mean.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.800
We're gonna eat them.

13:22.671 --> 13:25.021
You know, I think Halloween
really agrees with Jamie.

13:25.108 --> 13:26.414
He's standing up
straighter.

13:26.501 --> 13:28.590
And he didn't try
to pee on that dog.

13:30.418 --> 13:33.073
Is that the old guy
from the egging?

13:34.726 --> 13:36.032
No, that guy had glasses.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.817
No, the first egging.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.906
Heh. Oh, yeah.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.389
I think he's chasing us.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.348
Yeah, I guess he is.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.569
We should... try to get away.

13:51.656 --> 13:53.484
Yeah, I guess we have no choice.

13:58.968 --> 14:01.492
Whew! That was close.

14:12.329 --> 14:16.681
[groaning]

14:25.429 --> 14:26.735
Here you go.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.519
Some hot tea.

14:28.606 --> 14:29.738
Are you warm enough?

14:29.825 --> 14:30.957
I can turn on
the defroster.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.306
I'm good, Dad.

14:32.393 --> 14:33.698
I just want to make sure
you're comfortable.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.309
Well, you could have
let me stay in the house.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.398
[ laughs]
No, no.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.835
We're safe out here.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.234
Isn't this nice?

14:47.321 --> 14:49.497
Tell me what's going
on in your life.

14:49.584 --> 14:51.194
Got a special girl?

14:51.281 --> 14:52.239
KIDS:
Trick or treat!

14:52.326 --> 14:53.675
Oh, hey.

14:53.762 --> 14:55.416
We're over here!

14:55.503 --> 14:57.113
Got candy in the car!

14:57.200 --> 14:59.724
Kids love
this holiday.

14:59.811 --> 15:01.161
If they only knew.

15:01.248 --> 15:02.684
Oh, there you are.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.816
There you go.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.515
Here you go.
And here's--

15:07.602 --> 15:09.996
Would you mind
lifting up your mask?

15:11.345 --> 15:14.130
Great! Just checking.

15:15.653 --> 15:16.654
Thank you.

15:16.741 --> 15:18.352
Good night.

15:18.439 --> 15:19.570
God, I hate
when they want

15:19.657 --> 15:20.789
to talk
about your costumes.

15:20.876 --> 15:21.921
They know
what we're here for.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.183
Just pay up,
so we can go.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.623
Hey, look at that!

15:28.710 --> 15:29.798
The old guy's
still after us.

15:31.234 --> 15:32.235
You gotta admire it.

15:32.322 --> 15:33.628
I hope when I'm his age,

15:33.715 --> 15:35.195
I still have enough hate
to do what he's doing.

15:35.282 --> 15:37.197
Oh, there's my little tiger!

15:37.284 --> 15:39.677
You are so adorable.

15:39.764 --> 15:42.767
If you boys got him involved
in anything bad, I will...

15:42.854 --> 15:45.683
Mom, relax. We've just been
very busy getting candy.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.207
I'm sorry.
I'm just so frazzled.

15:47.294 --> 15:48.904
I almost didn't make it.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.210
I wasted my whole break
sitting with some shoplifter

15:50.297 --> 15:51.689
and no one else

15:51.776 --> 15:53.126
even considered coming to help.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.475
I mean,
can you believe that?!

15:54.562 --> 15:55.998
I'm the one who suffers

15:56.085 --> 15:57.391
and they're the ones
who were breaking all the rules.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.175
You know, this one time,
I accidentally accepted

15:59.262 --> 16:02.178
a Canadian quarter, and they
took it out of my paycheck,

16:02.265 --> 16:04.093
based on that day's
exchange rate.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.790
Yeah, so...

16:05.877 --> 16:06.791
And, you know that when
they deposited that quarter,

16:06.878 --> 16:07.575
the rate was way,
way lower.

16:07.662 --> 16:08.880
Did I complain?

16:08.968 --> 16:10.491
No, because I'm a team player.

16:10.578 --> 16:12.101
Mom! We've saved you
the best stretch of houses.

16:12.188 --> 16:13.189
They're right around
that corner.

16:13.276 --> 16:14.277
Really?

16:14.364 --> 16:15.626
Thank you.

16:15.713 --> 16:16.671
Let's go, sweetie.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.238
[ screeches weakly]

16:18.325 --> 16:20.327
Who is that guy?

16:27.812 --> 16:29.466
[ gasps]
Dad.

16:29.553 --> 16:30.859
I'm awake!

16:30.946 --> 16:32.513
What are you doing?
Get in the car.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.644
It's okay.
I have proof

16:33.731 --> 16:34.689
the murders never
happened here.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.780
Some of the police reports
didn't seem right,

16:38.867 --> 16:40.608
so I went to the City
Planning Office Web site.

16:40.695 --> 16:43.393
Some time after the murders,
they split up a double lot

16:43.480 --> 16:45.308
down the street, and that
changed all the addresses.

16:45.395 --> 16:46.353
Look.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.702
That's the zoning map.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.312
The murders weren't here.

16:49.399 --> 16:51.749
All these articles
are about the house next door.

16:51.836 --> 16:53.403
Well, look at that.

16:53.490 --> 16:54.926
Ha! That sucker!

16:55.014 --> 16:57.016
Do you know how much
he paid for that house?

16:57.103 --> 16:58.582
Have fun in hell, Peterson!

16:58.669 --> 17:00.410
Let me see what
he got himself into.

17:00.497 --> 17:01.890
Uh, no, no, no.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.413
The pictures are really
graphic, you shouldn't...

17:03.500 --> 17:05.198
Wait a minute.

17:05.285 --> 17:07.374
That's our wallpaper and...

17:07.461 --> 17:09.463
that's the counter.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.073
Malcolm, their house
doesn't look like this.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.944
This is our house.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.686
What is going on here?!

17:16.773 --> 17:19.080
Fine! I made it up because
I'm sick of your insanity!

17:19.167 --> 17:21.344
I dummied up a phony Web page
to calm you down.

17:21.431 --> 17:23.259
So you were gonna let me
think that I was safe?

17:23.346 --> 17:25.435
I wasn't going to sit in the car
with you all night! I'm sick!

17:25.521 --> 17:27.046
I was protecting you!

17:27.133 --> 17:28.612
From what, Dad?!

17:28.699 --> 17:30.353
From ghosts?!

17:31.180 --> 17:32.660
Well, I say bring them on.

17:32.747 --> 17:34.096
[ whispering]:
No... no...

17:34.183 --> 17:35.532
I hereby summon
all ghosts and goblins.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.186
No, no, no, no.

17:37.273 --> 17:38.970
Come phantoms and specters
from the gates of Hell,

17:39.058 --> 17:40.929
thou art hereby invited.

17:41.016 --> 17:42.452
He's kidding!

17:42.539 --> 17:44.019
That's the kind of language
they respond to.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.934
I challenge ye
to prove me wrong.

17:46.021 --> 17:48.110
Go ahead, rip the skin
from our bones

17:48.197 --> 17:49.894
and feast on our innards.

17:49.981 --> 17:52.375
We are lambs
for your slaughter.

17:52.462 --> 17:53.768
Malcolm!

17:53.855 --> 17:57.424
Swallow this house
into the bowels of Hell!

17:57.511 --> 17:59.295
[ doorbell rings]
[ shrieks]

17:59.382 --> 18:02.385
KIDS:
Trick or treat!

18:05.127 --> 18:08.696
Run! Run from this place
and never return!

18:11.394 --> 18:13.788
[ with awe]:
That guy was good.

18:13.875 --> 18:17.096
ALL:
Mm-hmm.

18:18.836 --> 18:20.664
Hey, you're right.

18:20.751 --> 18:23.276
The candy you steal off other
kids really does taste better.

18:23.363 --> 18:25.147
I'm telling you.
It's the fear.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.716
Trick!

18:28.803 --> 18:30.152
Come on.
Admit it, geezer.

18:30.239 --> 18:32.111
You're not gonna catch us.

18:32.198 --> 18:35.331
You're just too old and
too slow. Let's go, Dewey.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.815
Wow, look at that.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.904
Could it be
any more perfect?

18:47.474 --> 18:48.866
[both grunting]

18:48.953 --> 18:49.998
I'm stuck.

18:50.085 --> 18:51.391
Me, too.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.964
Boy, call me a prude,
but these pictures

19:00.051 --> 19:03.316
of Mrs. Keyes giving birth
are not as sexy as I thought.

19:03.403 --> 19:05.753
Well, that one's not bad.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.276
Craig, I want to get
some pictures of Jamie

19:07.363 --> 19:08.886
in his costume, so why don't you
give me a roll...

19:08.973 --> 19:11.498
Hey, Lois! I didn't expect you
back so soon.

19:11.585 --> 19:15.371
Oh, nice! So now we're invading
our customers' privacy.

19:15.458 --> 19:16.807
Why don't you just open up

19:16.894 --> 19:18.157
the pharmacy files
and see what's there?

19:18.244 --> 19:19.506
Been there, done that.

19:19.593 --> 19:21.464
FYI, I wouldn't
get too chummy

19:21.551 --> 19:23.031
with Mr. or Mrs. Sanders

19:23.118 --> 19:25.120
[ whispers]:
for four to six weeks.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.121
Excuse me, ma'am.
Can I have a word with you?

19:26.208 --> 19:27.688
Well, I'm glad to see

19:27.775 --> 19:29.690
you finally found the time
to show up, Officer,

19:29.777 --> 19:31.431
but our shoplifter is long gone.

19:31.518 --> 19:32.997
I'm not here
about a shoplifter.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.042
That's her!

19:34.129 --> 19:35.913
Mommy!

19:37.001 --> 19:39.743
-Oh, Allison, are you okay?
-Yes.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.397
Hands behind your back, ma'am.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.573
What? This is wrong.

19:43.660 --> 19:44.661
You're making a mistake.

19:44.748 --> 19:45.923
Don't worry, Lois.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.186
If you need
a character witness

19:47.273 --> 19:49.013
at your trial,
you got me.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.146
Uh-oh.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.713
[ retching]

19:56.195 --> 19:58.240
Have you boys learned
your lesson yet?

19:58.327 --> 20:00.547
Ha! You stupid old man!
I'll never learn my lesson.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.768
[ both grunting]

20:06.161 --> 20:09.033
I just want you
to know I'm sorry.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.470
A lot of things
were said here

20:10.557 --> 20:12.428
and I know it got out of hand.

20:12.515 --> 20:14.909
I don't want you
to take this personally.

20:14.996 --> 20:16.302
It's okay.

20:16.389 --> 20:17.651
I was out of line, too.

20:17.738 --> 20:20.610
I wasn't talking to you.

20:20.697 --> 20:23.439
Anyway, Gareth,
you should know...

20:23.526 --> 20:25.485
-Dad...
-Malcolm, let me work with him.

20:25.572 --> 20:27.138
No!
[ sighs]

20:27.226 --> 20:28.618
Dad, I know you're afraid,

20:28.705 --> 20:30.446
but you've gotta work
through your fear.

20:30.533 --> 20:33.057
Because it leads to this,
and this is insanity.

20:33.144 --> 20:35.756
I mean, okay, we live in
a universe that we can't control

20:35.843 --> 20:38.976
or understand and that can be
frightening sometimes.

20:39.063 --> 20:40.587
I have fears, too.

20:40.674 --> 20:41.762
But the only way we can
get through our lives

20:41.849 --> 20:43.503
is by tamping down
those fears.

20:43.590 --> 20:46.027
Because if we don't try
to explain things rationally,

20:46.114 --> 20:47.855
the world stops
making any sense at all.

20:47.942 --> 20:51.815
[ distant moaning]

20:52.555 --> 20:54.731
Like that moan?
We have to believe

20:54.818 --> 20:56.385
there's a perfectly logical
explanation for it.

20:56.472 --> 20:57.560
We have to.

20:57.647 --> 20:59.780
[ creaking, moaning]

20:59.867 --> 21:00.868
Or that.

21:00.955 --> 21:02.391
[ growls]

21:02.478 --> 21:03.914
It could mean whatever
we want it to mean.

21:04.001 --> 21:05.133
The important thing is...

21:05.220 --> 21:06.352
[ moans]

21:06.439 --> 21:09.311
[ screaming]

21:12.401 --> 21:14.229
[moaning]
Oh...

21:15.404 --> 21:17.406
MALCOLM:
That was Jamie, wasn't it?

21:17.493 --> 21:20.453
It sure was.
You okay, buddy?

21:58.926 --> 22:01.320
