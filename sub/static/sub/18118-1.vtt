02:47.000 --> 02:49.389
<i>Where would I be without my baby</i>

02:49.480 --> 02:51.835
<i>The thought alone might break me</i>

02:51.920 --> 02:54.309
<i>And I don't wanna go crazy</i>

02:54.400 --> 02:57.756
<i>- But every thug needs a lady</i>
<i>- Tired of being lonely</i>

02:58.840 --> 03:00.751
<i>Come on</i>

03:01.960 --> 03:04.428
<i>Don't you know that I love you</i>

03:14.440 --> 03:17.876
- Hey-Hey, good morning, Mr. Chase.
- Yes, it is.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.598
Oh, I don't see your driver.

03:19.680 --> 03:22.240
I gave him the day off.
It's his birthday.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.515
- Knicks? Courtside?
- Yeah, baby.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.717
- Mr. Chase, you are the man.
- Ah, just say hello to Spike for me.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.360
Oh, I'll do the right thing.

03:30.440 --> 03:33.955
What is this? Fifteen a grand a month,
I gotta listen to this racket?

03:37.920 --> 03:40.229
- Oh, well. I'm out of here.
- You have a good day.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.914
- Be careful out there, huh?
- Nothing can touch me today.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.673
- Give me that, punk!
- Mr. Chase.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.270
- Mr. Chase, you all right?
- Yeah.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.316
Stop, thief!

03:53.600 --> 03:58.151
- Come on, boy.
- You sure you're all right?

03:58.240 --> 04:00.754
I'll slice your little ass up.

04:06.920 --> 04:10.310
Now you need a nut doctor.
Get on before you get spit on.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.600
Hold it! Get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground!

04:15.680 --> 04:19.832
- This what you do to the hero?
- You got the wrong guy!

04:19.920 --> 04:22.388
- Do I look like Puffy?
- Shut up!

04:22.480 --> 04:25.074
- You got the wrong guy!
- Hey, that is not the guy.

04:25.160 --> 04:28.072
- What? What the hell you mean, it's not the guy?
- He got the briefcase back.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.991
- That is not the guy.
- Are you sure?

04:30.080 --> 04:34.437
- I'm positive.
- Now, you heard the man. Raise up off me!

04:38.000 --> 04:39.956
- What?
- Just... Really.

04:40.040 --> 04:42.634
I'm Muslim. I don't like
no parts of no pig!

04:42.720 --> 04:46.759
- Look, you okay?
- Man, I hope I don't need no stitches.

04:46.840 --> 04:50.150
I ain't got no insurance.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.708
I'm really sorry about this.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.075
And my mama got cancer.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.920
- I said cancer.
- I think this will cover it.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.753
Common cold is cool.

05:04.840 --> 05:07.400
- Well, uh, take care of yourself.
- You be careful out here, man.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.789
- I will. You get that looked at, 
all right? - All right.

05:09.880 --> 05:13.509
- Hey, you pigs know where the nearest
 emergency room is? - Okay, okay.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.269
Hey, you see
two guys come past here?

05:41.360 --> 05:43.920
- What? - Two guys. Big guy. Little guy.
Came past here just a second ago.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.278
- I saw no one. I don't know. 
I didn't see anybody. - Shit!

05:50.000 --> 05:52.116
- Good morning, Mr. Chase.
- Hey, Julie.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.711
Good morning, Mr. Chase.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.431
Are you all right?

06:01.520 --> 06:04.239
What is it?

06:04.320 --> 06:06.754
Look, I may have only been here
two months...

06:06.840 --> 06:10.310
but I know you well enough
to know when something's wrong.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.516
What gave me away,
wrinkled suit or bad attitude?

06:12.600 --> 06:14.830
Definitely the attitude.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.276
I'll work on it.
What you got for me?

06:18.360 --> 06:20.920
The Henderson wire transfers
came in from Switzerland...

06:21.000 --> 06:24.151
and financial. Com
just announced a split, and...

06:24.240 --> 06:26.515
I think this will make
the rest of your day a little better.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.909
The Don Carlos transfer
came through this morning.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.514
- It's a little more than we expected.
- Don't tease me.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.670
106 million more.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.349
- Stop kidding.
- I never joke about money.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.833
Good morning, Daryl.
What's the matter with you?

06:43.920 --> 06:48.072
Don Carlos came in.
106 million over.

06:48.160 --> 06:51.072
- 106 six million. You sure about that?
- Yep.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.720
That's a lot of money for a Mexican
soda company, don't you think?

06:53.800 --> 06:56.678
I'll have to see about this. Oh!

06:56.760 --> 07:00.389
I'm sorry. I know it's late. Can you
get us all into Chloe's show tonight?

07:00.480 --> 07:03.677
- I'll pull a few strings. How many do you
need? - Well, our $ 106-million mystery man...

07:03.760 --> 07:05.876
is coming into town:
Thomas Chela.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.997
- Mr. Don Carlos himself. To what do 
we owe the pleasure? - I don't know.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.991
- We got to show him a good time.
- Oh, absolutely.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.719
I can also check over his last quarter
financials to make sure everything tracks.

07:13.800 --> 07:17.315
If you find anything,
I want to see it.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.472
I'm sorry to interrupt, but there's
somebody in your office, Mr. Chase.

07:20.560 --> 07:25.031
- Not now, Shari. - I think you should 
see him. He says it's a family matter.

07:25.120 --> 07:28.078
Look, a broker is a smoker.
You ever heard of E-Trade?

07:28.160 --> 07:30.310
Yeah, you can do
that shit for free.

07:30.400 --> 07:34.279
I'm Freddy Tiffany, internationally
known, I might add. All right.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.635
My nigga!

07:36.720 --> 07:39.314
Hey, you got any job openings?
This is some easy-ass shit.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.470
Oh, yeah. Let me call
Human Resources. Shari?

07:41.560 --> 07:43.676
Hook a brother up.

07:43.760 --> 07:46.991
Man, how'd a brother like you
get a big-ass office like this...

07:47.080 --> 07:50.038
with fancy furniture
and whatnot...

07:50.120 --> 07:53.112
without the benefit
of some kind of mischief.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.351
You keep campaigning for this
ass-whooping, you gonna get elected.

07:56.440 --> 08:00.911
Cool. Look. I was just jokin' about
the phone, man. Wasn't nobody on it.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.833
And I feel kind of bad
about what happened earlier.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.195
- What is that?
- It's your money.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.551
Is that Chloe Kent?

08:13.640 --> 08:18.316
Hey, that's that La Perla supermodel.
Man, I'd sure like to wax her drawers.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.755
I'll let her know.

08:20.840 --> 08:24.435
Hey, ain't no need for all this shit.
How's your mama? We went out.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.670
- Hey, look, girl, what you need 
is a thug in your life. - Come on.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.716
You know damn well
you like danger, girl.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.349
- You from the projects. You from 
the projects. - I could kick his ass.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.317
<i>Dance to the beat</i>
<i>and shuffle my feet</i>

08:34.400 --> 08:36.674
<i>Can you dance</i>
<i>Can you dance to the beat, beat, beat</i>

09:00.480 --> 09:02.391
- Charles. - Daryl, how
are you? - I'm good. You?

09:02.480 --> 09:04.948
- Oh, good. Real good.
- Morgan, you look beautiful.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.759
- Thank you. So good to see you.
- Great to see you.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.513
- Thank you. - You mind if 
I steal him for just one second?

09:10.600 --> 09:13.160
- Only for a second.
- One. - Sorry.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.629
Oh, now, this is a party.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.632
- C.A.?
- Hmm?

09:19.720 --> 09:21.836
Charles, we have a problem.

09:21.920 --> 09:25.310
Don Carlos Cola does not exist.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.834
Shari called eight different distributors,
and no one had ever heard of it.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.309
- Oh, I like that girl.
- Hey, this is serious.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.756
Northeast National has a fiduciary 
interest here, and you know as well as 
I know, my name's on those documents.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.195
- And I'm not going to jail.
- Slow down, Daryl.

09:36.280 --> 09:39.909
We can't go charging in without hard evidence.
If it's there, we'll find it. We'll find it.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.389
Look, I'm calling the S.E.C.
First thing in the morning.

09:42.480 --> 09:45.552
We'll do it together, all right?
All right?

09:45.640 --> 09:48.837
- All right.
- All right. Uh, there he is.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.559
- Thomas! Thomas!
- Hey.

09:51.640 --> 09:55.394
- May I introduce Daryl Chase?
- Oh, this is the man.

09:55.480 --> 09:59.712
The one who has been working so hard
on building my future. Oh!

10:01.120 --> 10:04.954
- This is my companion. Maque Sanchez.
- Ah!

10:09.120 --> 10:12.874
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Chase.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.556
106 million.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.551
Uh, some quarter you had.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.869
- Some quarter.
- Well, why don't we all sit down?

10:25.960 --> 10:27.916
Yes, why don't we?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.991
I didn't realize that was so funny.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.878
Mr. Chase, you have such
a beautiful accent.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.871
Where did you learn
to speak Spanish?

10:34.960 --> 10:39.272
Uh, if you could, um...
for one second.

10:39.360 --> 10:41.828
Thomas. Tell me.

10:41.920 --> 10:45.276
Did you reallocate additional working
capital towards a Don Carlos ad campaign?

10:45.360 --> 10:47.920
Oh, I really like you.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.357
I'm so glad
you are on our side.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.314
So am I.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.949
Tell me. When are you gonna
come visit us in Mexico?

11:03.640 --> 11:06.871
You know, I got no plans
in the foreseeable future.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.428
Oh, but you would have
so much fun.

11:10.520 --> 11:16.390
Uh, Chloe! I, um... They
just invited us to Mexico, honey.

11:19.600 --> 11:23.149
- Looks like a nigga got busted.
- Ooh, Superfly.

11:23.240 --> 11:27.028
- And what is your name, beautiful thing?
- Oh! Maque.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.908
I'm thinking about "macking" you too.
Get butt-naked and you're mine, girl.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.958
I'm telling you. I'm gonna get
a piece of that right there.

11:34.040 --> 11:37.794
- What are you doing here?
- I'm enjoying myself. And how about you?

11:37.880 --> 11:41.793
- Hey, why don't you enjoy yourself 
over there? - Ha! Yeah.

11:41.880 --> 11:47.159
It's obvious this rude nigga here don't
wanna introduce me to you "peoples. "

11:47.240 --> 11:50.676
- So I figure I'll introduce myself.
- One second. I'm very sorry.

11:50.760 --> 11:54.639
I am Freddy Tiffany,
internationally known, I might add.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.711
How you doin', baby?
Look at you, girl.

11:56.800 --> 12:00.475
I don't care. We could knock
the cobwebs off of it, me and you, girl.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.596
I'm telling ya.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.672
What is up with your eye, G.?

12:05.760 --> 12:09.230
Oh, I get it. That way you can scope
on her without pissing her off.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.470
You know what you need
is some Visine and some Windex.

12:11.560 --> 12:14.791
- Much money as you making, you could 
afford a better eye. - Hey, what's up, Daryl?

12:14.880 --> 12:17.633
- Everything cool?
- No, everything is not cool.

12:17.720 --> 12:20.871
The little leprechaun pimp here, and
he is messing up our entire evening.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.951
- Now, get rid of him.
- Who?

12:24.600 --> 12:26.511
Look at...

12:34.680 --> 12:36.477
Hey!

12:45.600 --> 12:48.672
I am so sorry.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.195
- You wanna tell me what the problem is?
- Nothing, all right?

12:56.280 --> 12:58.919
Daryl, I can't believe you were flirting with
his girlfriend or whoever the hell she is.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.389
- Chloe, I wasn't flirting.
- Oh, give me a break, please!

13:01.480 --> 13:04.313
Did you think she was cute?
Was that it? You thought she was cute?

13:20.160 --> 13:22.993
Freeze!

13:24.520 --> 13:28.149
- Sweep it, Martinez. Sweep
it. - We got it! - Shit. Chloe.

13:28.240 --> 13:31.277
It's okay, Mr. Chase.
We're the good guys.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.351
Martinez! What do you got?

13:33.440 --> 13:35.670
- All clear!
- Baby, you okay?

13:35.760 --> 13:37.830
- What happened?
- I don't know.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.676
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

13:41.760 --> 13:46.197
Sorry to barge in. Timothy Jarrett McCready,
CIA. This over here is Agent Martinez.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.029
- He's dead.
- Martinez, take care of her.

13:50.120 --> 13:53.032
- Hey! Back off.
- What?

13:55.080 --> 13:56.832
I'm sorry.

13:56.920 --> 14:00.435
Mr. Chase, we need to talk.

14:00.520 --> 14:03.717
Relax. They're with me.

14:03.800 --> 14:07.918
- You wanna tell me what's going on?
- All secure. <i>- You got 'em?</i>

14:08.000 --> 14:11.436
- Mr. Chase and Miss Kent are now in our 
protection. Yeah. <i> - Wrap it up. </i>

14:11.520 --> 14:13.511
We'll do.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.273
Clean.

14:16.360 --> 14:21.275
Mr. Chase, we've been working a deep cover
operation in Mexico. It involves drug trafficking...

14:21.360 --> 14:25.717
extortion and the murder of Governor
Eduardo Quintana in Chihuahua.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.190
- Okay, that... What does that 
have to do with us? - Yeah.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.714
Have you ever heard
of Don Carlos Cola?

14:31.800 --> 14:35.395
It's a dummy corporation that's a front
for the Gutierrez drug cartel.

14:35.480 --> 14:38.438
They've been laundering money
through this corporation for years.

14:38.520 --> 14:41.910
This morning they made
a $ 106-million deposit to your bank.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.275
Daryl, what's going on?

14:49.120 --> 14:52.271
Have you ever seen these two men?

14:52.360 --> 14:54.396
No. Have you?

14:56.160 --> 15:00.199
- No.
- That is your house guest from tonight.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.191
I gotta assume you're going
somewhere with this.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.113
Those two guys are on
the Gutierrez payroll.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.749
In fact, they've been hanging around
the neighborhood for the last few days.

15:08.840 --> 15:12.594
Wait a minute. That's the guy
that was on stage with me.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.877
Well, now, this asshole you ought to
arrest. Anything you need, I'll testify.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.952
Yeah, that's Freddy Tiffany.
He's an absolutely crazy man.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.156
- Stay away from him.
- Wait a minute.

15:24.280 --> 15:26.840
- How long have you been following me?
- Protecting you, Mr. Chase.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.992
There are people out there who want you
dead. I'm not gonna let that happen.

15:30.080 --> 15:33.789
But for me to help you,
you gotta trust me.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.711
Daryl.

15:41.480 --> 15:44.916
Look, I gotta get back to Mexico
for a few days and wind this thing up.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.279
Agent Martinez is gonna stay 
here and provide protection for both of 
you until we get this case solved.

15:50.360 --> 15:54.194
Meanwhile, if anything goes wrong...
anything...

15:54.280 --> 15:56.589
Mr. Chase, you call me.

16:01.720 --> 16:05.554
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.111
Good luck.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.151
Hey, you guys.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.310
- Good morning, Julie. What's going on?
- Hi, Mr. Chase. Shari's been 
calling you every few minutes.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.595
- I think there's something really wrong.
- Yeah, I know. She just paged me.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.069
- Is she okay?
- She's hysterical. She couldn't even talk.

16:25.160 --> 16:28.232
And then these two guys
showed up looking for you.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.231
- In my office? - Yeah. They're in 
your office with Mr. Allsworth.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.231
- Who are they?
- I have no idea.

16:34.520 --> 16:38.115
- Oh, shit.
- Mr. Chase?

16:38.200 --> 16:42.159
- Can I get you more coffee? No? A bagel or...
- Excuse me, please, please. Mr. Chase.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.871
Mr. Chase?

16:48.200 --> 16:50.430
- Step aside! Mr. Chase!
- Move!

16:50.520 --> 16:53.637
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

16:53.720 --> 16:55.756
Come on! Move!

16:55.840 --> 16:59.230
Shari, it's me, Daryl.

16:59.320 --> 17:02.073
Shari?

17:02.160 --> 17:05.152
Hey!

17:05.240 --> 17:08.710
I don't wanna see you naked,
but if I have to...

17:17.520 --> 17:19.271
<i>Hang up and call again. </i>

17:29.920 --> 17:32.309
<i>If you'd like to make a call... </i>

17:36.320 --> 17:38.390
Freeze!

17:51.000 --> 17:54.436
Oh! Oh, shit. No.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.516
- Well, you did it again.
- Hey, it happens.

18:02.600 --> 18:07.435
- No! No! No! - Come on, guys. How'd the wife...
 How'd the wife get in here?

18:07.520 --> 18:11.433
- Hello? Is that you, Daryl?
<i>- Hello? McCready, is that you?</i>

18:11.520 --> 18:14.159
Hell, yeah, it's me. I'm in trouble.
They think I killed two cops.

18:14.240 --> 18:18.836
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yeah, sure. Hold on. My secretary, she is dead.

18:18.920 --> 18:22.708
<i>Those two guys you showed me
</i> <i>the pictures of, they showed up</i>
 <i>at my office this morning. </i>

18:22.800 --> 18:24.791
- Look, I'm in trouble.
- Excuse me.

18:24.880 --> 18:29.476
- Woman, woman, step off, all right?
- But you're not using the phone.

18:29.560 --> 18:33.030
I got the phone now. You happy?
Look, the shit just hit the fan here.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.156
Get your ass up here
and get me out of this.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.515
Okay. First you gotta
get out of New York.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.272
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

18:39.360 --> 18:43.672
I didn't kill anybody.
I don't wanna leave New York. Stop it!

18:43.760 --> 18:46.991
<i>- You wanna take</i> <i>your
chances with NYPD?</i> - Shit.

18:47.080 --> 18:49.116
Look, I'm black. I'm not stupid.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.317
Okay, get your black ass to Mexico
where I can protect you.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.755
Meet me in the town of La Questa.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.992
La Questa. All right.

18:58.080 --> 19:01.311
Listen, Daryl, don't use
your credit card, don't show your ID.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.312
<i>If you do, they'll find you,</i>
<i>they'll kill you. </i>

19:04.400 --> 19:06.994
<i>Just get to Mexico. </i>
<i>Don't look at anybody. </i>

19:07.080 --> 19:10.993
Don't wave at anybody.
Don't talk to anybody.

19:11.160 --> 19:13.310
Yo, bitch, what up?

19:13.400 --> 19:18.076
What's a uptown nigga like yourself
doin' down here with us common folk?

19:18.160 --> 19:22.199
Figure a bitch like you
be in a limo, G-five, G-nine.

19:22.280 --> 19:25.477
You know, that kind of shit.
You know, me and the Big Apple, baby.

19:25.560 --> 19:30.315
It's like the 1900s.
It's over. It's over, baby.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.153
You know, you one rude Negroid.

19:33.240 --> 19:37.358
Didn't your mother ever tell you to talk to
people when they talk to you? Be sociable.

19:37.440 --> 19:41.558
See, I know what your problem is. Your
father fondled you as a child, didn't he?

19:41.640 --> 19:43.676
See, what you need
is some couch time.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.796
Just sit down
and let it all out.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.394
It happened to me... me and my grandfather.
I remember I was three years old.

19:48.480 --> 19:52.359
- Hey, listen to me. I'm serious.
- It was only when he was on that moonshine.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.829
Please.

19:54.920 --> 19:58.595
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

19:58.680 --> 20:01.831
Hey, hey, hey, baby. Hey, hey, hey. Hey,
baby. It's gonna be all right.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.150
Come here. Daddy love you.

20:05.920 --> 20:09.435
All right, in, baby, yeah.
Get your bitch ass back in the bag.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.470
Nigga, nigga, nigga.

20:17.560 --> 20:21.599
You got the NYPD "shoot a brother
41 times" after your ass.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.910
- Would you keep your voice down?
- No wonder you're nervous.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.673
- I need to get to Mexico.
- And people in hell need ice water.

20:26.760 --> 20:29.672
A fat woman wanna be skinny.
A midget wanna be tall.

20:29.760 --> 20:32.228
- You wanna be white.
- I'll take that as a yes.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.312
- Come on, man.
- Hey, hey. Watch the clothes, man.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.233
- If you're gonna help me, help me. But just...
- Oh, he need some help.

20:38.320 --> 20:43.075
Well, look here. If you don't 
wanna go to thepenitentiary, you might 
wanna listen to your new partner.

20:43.160 --> 20:47.472
Okay. Everybody, meet my new partner.
My new partner.

20:47.560 --> 20:51.599
Top of the day. How's it going? 
How you doin' there, sir? I'll be 
over there in a couple of hours.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.194
Don't worry about it.
We got it all under control.

20:54.280 --> 20:57.317
Hey, hey, smile, man.
You look suspicious.

20:58.680 --> 21:02.195
That's what I'm talkin'
about there too.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.919
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Loosen up the walk, too, man.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.117
You know what I mean?
Put a little pep in the step.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.077
That's right. That's right.
Take it back to the hood.

21:10.160 --> 21:14.358
It's all good in the hood. It's
all good. How's it going there, sir?

21:14.440 --> 21:18.877
I want you to check the numbers on the ticker
tape and I'll get back to you at 7:00. All right?

21:18.960 --> 21:22.589
Look, bro, just act black.
That's all you gotta do.

21:24.360 --> 21:26.715
Say, blood.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.109
- What it is, jive turkey.
- Hey, hey, hey, bro...

21:29.200 --> 21:31.111
All right, mama.

21:32.640 --> 21:35.359
What's the last movie you seen, man?
<i>Car Wash?</i>

21:35.440 --> 21:37.635
Man, you can kiss my ass.
<i>Car Wash</i> was a good movie.

21:37.800 --> 21:40.314
<i>Final boarding call</i>
<i>for the</i> Empire Builder...

21:40.400 --> 21:41.799
<i>with service to Newark... </i>

21:41.880 --> 21:44.633
Hey, Mr. Chase!
In the blue suit!

21:47.000 --> 21:51.198
- Mr. Chase! - Hey, hey, hey! What is your problem?
 Get your hands off of me, mister!

21:51.280 --> 21:53.669
- All right, I'm sorry. We made a mistake.
- Of course you made a mistake.

21:53.760 --> 21:55.955
And I demand an apology
from the both of you.

21:56.040 --> 21:59.350
What is this all about? A white man
in a suit with a black man in a suit...

21:59.440 --> 22:02.193
<i>African-American male, 6'1 "to 6'3",</i>
<i>wearing a blue suit. </i>

22:02.280 --> 22:05.670
- Why you puttin' your hands on me?
- Did you say blue suit?

22:05.760 --> 22:08.274
<i>Copy that. </i>

22:08.360 --> 22:10.271
You'll love it.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.551
- How rude.
- I'm talking to you!

22:13.640 --> 22:15.790
- Whoa! Whoa! Would you just get on the train?
- Just get on the train.

22:15.880 --> 22:19.350
- Some kind of Feds, huh? - We
gotta go. - I know my rights!

22:19.440 --> 22:23.797
What do you want? There's not
gonna be any Rodney Kings going on.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.874
- Hey! Oh, I'm doing good.
- Hey, how are you, sir?

22:28.960 --> 22:31.474
- You got your ticket?
- Yes, yes, yes. How you doin', sisters?

22:31.560 --> 22:34.233
This is their first time on a train. 
I'm trying to tell them how much fun
they're gonna have.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.471
Oh. There's a first time
for everything.

22:37.560 --> 22:40.028
You must not do that, young man.

22:40.240 --> 22:43.232
Look, we're not trying
to give you a hard time, Mr. Allsworth.

22:43.320 --> 22:46.437
But imagine how we feel when two
of our fellow officers turn up dead.

22:46.520 --> 22:51.036
Well, why don't I ask the commissioner about it
tomorrow when he comes to my house for cocktails?

22:51.120 --> 22:53.998
Yes, he is a friend of mine.
And so is Daryl Chase.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.878
A very good friend.
I brought him into this firm.

22:56.960 --> 23:01.078
He is the best and the brightest. I refuse to
believe that he has anything to do with this.

23:01.160 --> 23:03.993
Okay, good. Now we're all very clear
on what you refuse to believe.

23:04.080 --> 23:07.311
So why don't I tell you what we do
believe? We believe you're full of shit.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.676
And we believe Daryl Chase is up to no good.
Now, we followed him all the way to Penn Station.

23:10.760 --> 23:13.911
- Where do you think he was going?
- Vacation, maybe.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.037
Vaca... Did he... Did he maybe have a
little vacation time stored up, Mr. Allsworth?

23:17.120 --> 23:20.510
- What's your point? - My point is that 
we've notified the authorities everywhere...

23:20.600 --> 23:24.434
Mexico, Canada, Oz. Wherever he goes,
they're gonna catch him.

23:24.520 --> 23:28.957
But just in case there's a slight possibility that
he contacts you first, do me one little favor.

23:29.040 --> 23:32.715
Pick up the phone,
give us a call, okay?

23:32.800 --> 23:35.997
- Good day, Mr. Allsworth.
- Goodbye, Mr. Allsworth.

23:36.080 --> 23:40.392
- You know, I actually believed you were NYPD.
- You did a very good job too.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.318
You know, most people who wear these
are actually missing a tooth.

23:57.400 --> 24:00.597
- I just liked the way it looked.
- You would.

24:00.680 --> 24:04.434
It look good on you, though, bro.
It look good.

24:04.520 --> 24:07.956
Hi. Just the man I'm looking for. I need
two phone lines put in this room if I can.

24:08.040 --> 24:11.919
I need an Internet access on one, fax on the other,
paper at every stop... <i>New York Times... </i>

24:12.000 --> 24:14.753
He needs a fax.
He needs a fax.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.876
I got all your money.

24:18.960 --> 24:20.916
Look at that, girl.
Smell it.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.629
That's right. Can buy
a whole lot of dog food with that.

24:24.720 --> 24:28.679
Whole lot of dog...

24:28.760 --> 24:30.671
You're a little cutie pie,
you know that?

24:30.760 --> 24:33.832
- Those things are not included in the 
price of a ticket. - All I need...

24:33.920 --> 24:36.753
is two phone lines in this room:
One with Internet access...

24:36.840 --> 24:40.037
- You're being rude, just like you were today
 to those two nuns. - One with a fax.

24:40.120 --> 24:43.351
- Making new friends, are we?
- Good morning, sir. How are you? Having a nice trip?

24:43.440 --> 24:45.351
I'm having an excellent time.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.876
Look. Whatever my friend needs here,
you put that on my tab.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.713
You got it, sir.
Whatever you say, you got it.

24:51.800 --> 24:54.268
What a gentleman. You gotta love him.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.918
You were rude.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.230
Racist asshole.

25:00.320 --> 25:03.073
Ah, you're gettin' a taste
of your own medicine.

25:03.160 --> 25:06.277
Now you're startin' to find out
it wasn't the brother in the suit...

25:06.360 --> 25:08.396
but it was the suit
that was on the brother...

25:08.480 --> 25:10.948
that got you
your so-called respect.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.957
Nice watch, ain't it?

25:16.040 --> 25:19.077
Yeah, uh, it's... it's real classy.

25:19.160 --> 25:22.869
Look, uh, Freddy, I appreciate everything
you did helping me get on this train.

25:22.960 --> 25:26.794
And I ain't gonna forget it. But when we get
to the next stop, we go our own separate ways.

25:26.880 --> 25:31.112
- Your services are no longer required.
- Oh. Oh, well, ain't that a bitch.

25:31.200 --> 25:36.035
It's just like you rich people. When
you get done using us downtrodden...

25:36.120 --> 25:37.599
hood recipients...

25:37.680 --> 25:39.955
you wanna kick us to the curb.

25:40.040 --> 25:44.955
Throw us to the wolves
like some naked sheep.

25:45.040 --> 25:48.237
What the hell do naked sheep got
to do with ghetto recipients, Freddy?

25:48.320 --> 25:51.517
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I give you this much.

25:51.600 --> 25:55.832
You know, you probably went to some kind
of accredited school, college and whatnot.

25:55.920 --> 26:00.277
- Yeah, I went to Harvard. So what?
- Well, you know, I went to H.K. U...

26:00.360 --> 26:01.998
Hard Knock University.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.150
And that's what you gonna
need to get out of this.

26:04.240 --> 26:07.676
They ain't gonna take no book smarts.
Street smarts.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.354
- I don't need you, Freddy.
- You saying you smarter than me?

26:10.440 --> 26:12.556
- I'm saying I'm smarter than you.
- You smarter than me?

26:12.640 --> 26:16.519
- I'm smarter than you.
- Your neurons are firing quicker than mine are.

26:16.600 --> 26:19.910
I got your Bulgari ring, your watch...

26:20.000 --> 26:23.117
your Italian suit
that caresses me, oh, so well...

26:23.200 --> 26:26.749
and a phat wad of cash...
that you said was two Gs...

26:26.840 --> 26:29.877
ah, in what used to be
your inner pocket.

26:29.960 --> 26:33.032
And I got all of that
in less than ten seconds, girl.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.509
Did you hear her? Say it again, baby.

26:35.600 --> 26:38.319
Ten seconds. But you smarter than me.

26:43.200 --> 26:46.078
Come on. Let's burn some ants.

26:46.160 --> 26:48.549
We're gonna burn some bugs
with these here.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.399
What are you doing here?

27:02.480 --> 27:06.155
Well, according to the two D cups
on your watch, it's dinnertime.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.390
You got dinnertime money?

27:10.960 --> 27:12.996
I'm just jokin'. I'm just jokin'.

27:13.080 --> 27:16.868
- You know, your credit's good with me.
- Excuse me, sir.

27:16.960 --> 27:20.032
Here's the paper you wanted.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.190
That's for him.

27:22.280 --> 27:25.113
- Thanks, Guido.
- It's Vito.

27:25.200 --> 27:28.112
- Whatever. - Thank
you, sir. - Anytime now.

27:28.200 --> 27:32.716
- Why don't you just bury your head in his ass?
- Let's see. One dinner...

27:32.800 --> 27:35.758
- You gentlemen ready to order?
- Ah, yes, yes.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.400
I'm going to have...

27:38.480 --> 27:40.710
Let's see here.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.836
The prime rib, medium rare.

27:42.920 --> 27:46.310
And bring me some Grand Marnier
over the rocks.

27:46.400 --> 27:50.598
That's the way we used to have it when I
was in Harvard. Chauncey made the best ones.

27:53.880 --> 27:57.236
I'm gonna have the yard bird
burnt to a crisp.

27:57.320 --> 28:00.073
Now, I need you to spit on that
with a little bit of hot Tabasco.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.869
And I'm gonna wash all that down
with a 40 dog of Schlitz malt liquor.

28:03.960 --> 28:07.191
I'm sorry, sir. I don't believe
we have Schlitz malt liquor.

28:13.560 --> 28:17.553
No Schlitz malt liquor?
No Schlitz malt liquor?

28:17.640 --> 28:21.428
Well, ain't that some shit. How you
gonna run a successful business...

28:21.520 --> 28:23.670
and you ain't got
no Schlitz malt liquor?

28:23.760 --> 28:26.877
You ain't keepin' it real.
You ain't representin'.

28:26.960 --> 28:30.714
What you doin' up in here, boy?
Uh, uh, uh, shit.

28:30.800 --> 28:34.110
- I'll see what I can do, sir.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.316
<i>Fresh-Prince-of-Bel-Air-looking</i> mo...

28:36.400 --> 28:39.597
He do look like
the father on the <i>Fresh Prince. </i>

28:47.360 --> 28:49.874
Hey, uh, look, bro.

28:51.880 --> 28:56.112
We ain't gettin' nowhere by fightin'.
Why don't you just talk to me?

28:56.200 --> 28:59.749
I mean, how bad can it be?
It ain't like you murdered anybody.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.236
Man, what kind of shit are you into?

29:04.320 --> 29:07.915
Freddy, do you remember my assistant,
Shari? You met her at the office.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.275
The one with that phat ass?

29:10.360 --> 29:13.113
Yes. Well, she's dead.

29:13.200 --> 29:16.670
I'm sorry, man. My bad.
I'm sorry to hear that.

29:16.760 --> 29:19.991
L- I went to her apartment and, uh...

29:20.080 --> 29:23.709
I don't know what happened, man. These two cops
wound up dead, and they think I did everything.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.757
What's up with the CIA, bitch?

29:31.840 --> 29:36.391
- Ah, here you go, gentlemen.
- Uh, thank you. You're a scholar and a gentleman.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.391
Compliments to the chef.

29:38.480 --> 29:41.392
How do you know
about the CIA, Freddy?

29:49.200 --> 29:52.237
I, um... I can't really
talk to you about this.

29:53.640 --> 29:57.076
Is that why we're on our way to <i>Mexico?</i>

29:57.160 --> 29:59.913
I happen to know Mexico
like the back of my hand.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.434
I am internationally known.

30:02.520 --> 30:04.988
I done mischief everywhere.

30:05.080 --> 30:10.029
Puerto Rico, Colombia, Brazil...
all them Mexican countries.

30:10.120 --> 30:13.556
- That I believe.- Well, 
since you're starting to believe me...

30:13.640 --> 30:15.915
we been watched
for the last three states.

30:17.520 --> 30:21.832
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- I'm serious as a heart attack.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.639
By Curly from the Globetrotters
over your right shoulder.

30:28.800 --> 30:32.509
Don't look.
It'd call attention to yourself.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.754
See, you need me more than you think.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.588
'45 was a good year, sir.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.911
Yeah. Appreciate that.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.115
- Man, I gotta run.
- Run where?

31:00.200 --> 31:03.158
To the bathroom. Man, that prime rib
is running through me.

31:03.240 --> 31:05.390
Well, I hope you can hold it.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

31:05.480 --> 31:09.393
Oh, come on, man. Damn!
You heard me say I gotta go, man.

31:11.280 --> 31:13.555
Excuse me, uh, sir.

31:13.640 --> 31:16.632
- Could you help me with 
this door here? - Sure.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.790
Appreciate it.
Let's see what you got on you.

31:18.880 --> 31:22.589
I know you ain't got no condoms.
Too ugly.

31:22.680 --> 31:27.834
- We got your monkey ass.- Lookie here. 
A ugly picture of you. You know this dude?

31:27.920 --> 31:30.673
- Hell, no.
- Well, he seems to know you.

31:34.120 --> 31:37.237
Shit! Who is this, Freddy?

31:38.360 --> 31:40.999
I have no idea.

31:42.680 --> 31:45.513
- That was a good plan, man. Thanks.
- Oh, anytime.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He had a gun?

31:47.960 --> 31:52.397
"Had" is the key word
in that sentence.

31:55.520 --> 31:57.829
- Hey, Freddy.
- Yeah?

31:57.920 --> 32:00.229
Freddy, there's a body out here.
What you want me to do?

32:00.320 --> 32:04.791
Walk away from it before 
people think you had something 
to do with it. I'm using the bathroom!

32:21.600 --> 32:25.718
- Man, you really hit me, man. - Man, if 
you don't shut up, I'm gonna check your hinges.

32:25.800 --> 32:30.271
- Shut up, man, before you get us busted.
- I done met you down here like you told me to.

32:32.640 --> 32:35.791
- Dribble, Curly, dribble. Go to your lanes.
- You bust me in the head.

32:37.440 --> 32:39.795
- Hey, how's it going this evening?
- Fine.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.269
- Can I bother you for a paper?
- Go right ahead.

32:43.520 --> 32:46.273
Let's see what we got here.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.037
Uh, look, these papers...

32:53.120 --> 32:55.680
never made it on the train.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.637
Sir, I ain't got change for a hundred.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.871
- They ain't never made it on the train.
- They're gone.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.711
All aboard...

33:08.800 --> 33:10.711
the night train!

33:13.560 --> 33:16.154
No problem. I'll take care of it.
Hope you're having a nice trip, sir.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.754
- Wonderful. Put that on my bill.
- Shit.

33:18.840 --> 33:23.356
Well, well, well,
look who made the paper. Page three.

33:23.440 --> 33:26.876
"Wall Street Banker Wanted
for Questioning in Multiple Homicide. "

33:26.960 --> 33:28.871
No, no, no, keep reading.

33:28.960 --> 33:30.916
There's a $ 100,000 reward...

33:31.000 --> 33:36.233
for your whereabouts and/ or capture.

33:36.320 --> 33:39.949
- Are you gonna turn me in, Freddy?
- You know, the thought had crossed my mind.

33:41.440 --> 33:44.159
No, bro. Just relax.

33:44.240 --> 33:47.710
- You wanna take a seat?
- No, I'm okay.

33:47.800 --> 33:50.633
- You mind if I cop a squat?
- Not at all.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.676
All right. Join me, man.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.751
Go on. Take a load off.

33:57.480 --> 33:59.596
Look, Daryl.

34:04.920 --> 34:09.311
I believe you're innocent.
I had to be sure.

34:09.400 --> 34:13.552
You know, I treat each case
with a certain amount of trepidation.

34:14.719 --> 34:19.429
Uh, I'm really not Freddy Tiffany.

34:19.520 --> 34:21.750
My real name is Fred Tiffany.

34:21.840 --> 34:25.389
I had you fooled with
all that street shit, huh?

34:25.480 --> 34:27.516
Yeah.

34:27.600 --> 34:32.435
Mr. Chase, I'm with
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

34:32.520 --> 34:34.750
I'm protecting you
on the way to Mexico.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.353
And once we get there, we're
gonna flush out the real criminals.

34:37.440 --> 34:41.034
Man, you got everybody after you.
You got the CIA, the FBI...

34:41.120 --> 34:44.873
NBC, UPN, you pick a nigga,
<i>as-salaam alaikum. </i>

35:11.320 --> 35:15.313
- What happened to him? - Oh, he's just drunk, 
man. I'm just trying to wake him up, you know.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.756
Ya all right, baby?
Ya all right, brother?

35:26.440 --> 35:29.591
Get your ass off this train.

35:29.680 --> 35:32.752
- What the hell! What the hell are
 you doing? - Shut up!

35:32.840 --> 35:34.751
Help!

35:41.120 --> 35:42.951
What are you doing? No!

36:36.880 --> 36:39.633
- You're in trouble.
- I am?

36:39.720 --> 36:43.269
Yeah, you are. No pets on my train.

37:00.440 --> 37:03.159
Ah, damn! I had it!

37:05.000 --> 37:07.833
I'm gonna whoop his Wall Street ass.

37:16.080 --> 37:19.072
How's your mama? We went out.

37:19.160 --> 37:22.994
What you lookin' at? You know,
you'd make a nice nine-piece.

37:23.080 --> 37:26.595
Your ass and a couple of biscuits.
You know black people like chicken.

37:26.680 --> 37:30.559
You see any flies around me? Huh?
I'm just playin'. I'm just playin. '

37:34.200 --> 37:37.431
- Take care, now.
- Good luck to ya.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.556
Thank you.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.909
Hey, what's happening, <i>ese?</i>

37:51.000 --> 37:54.879
Hotter than a Mexican whorehouse on
nickel night with a $5 rebate, I hear.

37:56.080 --> 37:58.116
Mr. Funny Man, eh?

37:58.200 --> 38:01.431
And how long do you plan to honor us
with your presence in <i>Mexico?</i>

38:01.520 --> 38:05.149
I'm just gonna be here a couple of days.
But let me ask you somethin', now.

38:05.240 --> 38:07.754
Where them big-booty Mexican bitches be
hangin' out? You know what I'm sayin'?

38:07.840 --> 38:11.310
- Identification, <i>por favor. </i>
- Identification. No problem. No problem.

38:11.400 --> 38:15.359
You better alert the governor
that Freddy Tiffany is in the house.

38:15.440 --> 38:18.193
- Freddy Tiffany?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

38:18.280 --> 38:21.272
That's internationally known
Freddy Tiffany, fool.

38:21.360 --> 38:26.150
We'll alert the governor that
Mr. Internationally Known has arrived.

38:26.240 --> 38:29.630
- Internationally known.
- Just <i>un segundito. </i>

38:29.720 --> 38:32.518
Handcuff his ho when a nigga
like me step up in the place.

38:32.600 --> 38:36.479
Tell you right now.
Ain't that right, Delores?

38:37.960 --> 38:41.077
In, bitch.

38:41.160 --> 38:43.833
I'm gettin' tired of you.
Tell you that right now.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.831
Put on a little music.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.235
Goddam.

39:00.320 --> 39:02.675
<i>Arriba, arriba,</i>
Speedy Gonzalez.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.475
Let's go!

40:16.400 --> 40:18.914
Oooh, shit!

40:19.000 --> 40:22.754
You wanna live, get in the car.
You wanna die, get in the car.

40:22.840 --> 40:25.229
I know how to duck us into Mexico.

40:31.480 --> 40:36.508
Think! Just think, Daryl!
How is it I'm outside your apartment?

40:36.600 --> 40:39.194
How do I know where
your office is, Daryl?

40:39.280 --> 40:42.636
How am I at the bottom
of the escalators at Penn Station?

40:42.720 --> 40:45.951
Huh? I'm the FBI.

40:46.040 --> 40:48.554
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

40:48.640 --> 40:51.234
And the name is Fred Tiffany,
by the way!

40:51.320 --> 40:55.632
Most highly decorated agent
at the whole Bureau!

40:55.720 --> 40:58.632
But you wanna believe
a drug dealer, McCready.

40:58.720 --> 41:01.757
If I wasn't a Christian...

41:01.840 --> 41:04.115
Delores, sit still, bitch.

41:17.680 --> 41:22.037
Hey. Hey, that's one
of those old-school hip-hop beats.

41:23.160 --> 41:25.549
That's like some Run D.M.C.

41:27.800 --> 41:29.631
That's more like Grandmaster Flash.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.359
No, no, no. That's definitely Run D.M.C.
Man, listen to the grooves.

41:38.360 --> 41:40.476
Come on.
What you know about hip-hop?

41:40.560 --> 41:44.678
- You got that. You got that.
- Huh? This is "mus-ack. "

41:44.760 --> 41:47.354
Man, it's kind of phat, though.

41:47.440 --> 41:50.432
- I like the little mariachi horns, man.
- Yeah, that's tight. That's tight.

42:03.880 --> 42:06.440
- What you doin'? Leave that on.
- Oh, all right.

42:10.640 --> 42:12.551
You don't know nothin'
about that music.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.915
- What?
- Mus-ack.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.560
Definitely don't know nothin'
about dancing to no mus-ack.

42:17.640 --> 42:20.791
Son, you better recognize,
all right? I got skills.

42:20.880 --> 42:22.711
- Skills?
- Serious skills.

42:22.800 --> 42:26.713
Oh, show me some of them skills,
Mr. Wall Street Executive.

42:28.240 --> 42:31.550
- Is that a challenge?
- Yes, that's a challenge.

42:31.640 --> 42:34.154
Hold this.

42:34.240 --> 42:36.515
- Why, sure.
- I'm D.C., boy.

42:36.600 --> 42:39.068
Well, let me check Chocolate City out.

42:39.160 --> 42:42.118
Dark chocolate.

42:42.200 --> 42:45.033
Free your mind,
and your ass will follow.

42:49.440 --> 42:51.829
Aww.

42:51.920 --> 42:55.117
You might be from the projects.

42:58.800 --> 43:01.473
- Ah, son!
- That had to hurt.

43:01.560 --> 43:03.630
- All right.
- Here. Limp your way back over here.

43:03.720 --> 43:06.757
- Let me show you how it's done.
- Please take the stage.

43:06.840 --> 43:08.717
Tag, I'm it.
Let me show you how I used to do it...

43:08.800 --> 43:11.155
before I joined the Bureau.

43:11.240 --> 43:14.630
See, we used to take it up
like that there, nice and easy.

43:14.720 --> 43:18.269
Then we... huh, huh, huh...
bring it around like that.

43:18.360 --> 43:20.794
- Ohhh.
- Then we'd... huh... bring it.

43:20.880 --> 43:22.996
Drop it like it's hot.

43:23.080 --> 43:25.753
Tick, tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick, tick...

43:25.840 --> 43:27.956
tick, tick, tick.

43:28.040 --> 43:30.429
Take it back to Beat Street, baby.
Look out!

43:30.520 --> 43:32.590
Crazy legs.

43:32.680 --> 43:35.672
You gotta hit it like this
and bring it down like this.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.430
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

43:39.520 --> 43:43.638
Ah, hell, no! Come back here!

43:43.720 --> 43:48.077
- I'm gonna whoop your ass!
- Bye-bye, biatch!

43:52.120 --> 43:56.079
I'm gonna kill him.
Let's walk, girl.

43:56.160 --> 43:58.390
You got four legs. You walk. Shit.

43:58.480 --> 44:00.436
Come on.
Double-time, double-time.

44:12.520 --> 44:17.799
<i>Just follow the stairway</i>

44:17.880 --> 44:21.873
<i>To this lonely world of mine</i>

- No.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.549
- Cash or... cash.
- Yeah.

44:46.360 --> 44:49.113
Twenty, forty, sixty.

44:51.600 --> 44:55.354
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but what is that smell?

44:57.040 --> 45:01.989
- That smell is the wave of the future.
- This shit smell?

45:02.080 --> 45:05.117
- Emu.
- Oh, that's what those birds are.

45:05.200 --> 45:09.512
- Those are... Those are emu.
- 98% fat-free.

45:09.600 --> 45:14.390
All your protein and nutrients with the
savory flavor of chicken and steak combined...

45:14.480 --> 45:18.553
all in one easily farmable bird.

45:18.640 --> 45:20.551
Well, I tell ya, that sounds nutritious.
Good luck with that.

45:20.640 --> 45:23.871
- Can I get a key?
- Key.

45:23.960 --> 45:25.871
Thank you.

45:30.360 --> 45:32.999
Take it easy.

45:40.080 --> 45:42.992

45:51.800 --> 45:56.396
Damn, if I were him, I'd have shot the
son of a bitch that took that picture.

Have you bumped your head?

45:59.400 --> 46:01.550
Hey, little darlin'.

<i>I almost got killed at the border. </i>

46:29.160 --> 46:32.391
They thought I was Freddy Tiffany. By the
way, this guy keeps showing up everywhere.

46:32.480 --> 46:36.234
- How the hell does he keep finding me?
- I told you to stay away from Tiffany.

46:36.320 --> 46:41.348
I'm trying to stay away from Tiffany. I just
told you he keeps showing up everywhere I go.

46:41.440 --> 46:43.795
Plus, he claims you're at the centre
of some drug trafficking scheme.

46:43.880 --> 46:46.599
<i>Of course I'm at the centre</i>
<i>of it. I'm with the CIA.</i>

46:46.680 --> 46:51.231
Right now I'm watching a bunch of drug
smugglers load up a plane full of cocaine.

46:51.320 --> 46:53.595
They think I'm their friend.
That's what I do.

46:53.680 --> 46:56.638
I watch the bad guys.
Stop listening to a murderer.

46:56.720 --> 46:59.280
Listen, your murderer
thinks he's with the FBI.

46:59.360 --> 47:03.035
- He was kicked out of the Bureau two years ago.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

47:03.120 --> 47:06.669
- He really was with the FBI?
- He's out on a 5150. A mental.

47:06.760 --> 47:10.753
You are with a class-A psychopath.

47:10.840 --> 47:14.992
<i>Mr. Chase, stay put. </i> <i>We're coming to rescue
you and</i> <i>take Mr. Tiffany into custody. </i>

47:15.080 --> 47:17.640
<i>- Don't move. </i>
- I don't believe this.

47:17.720 --> 47:20.393
Fine. Hey, McCready. McCready?

47:22.000 --> 47:24.468
- Hello? Daryl.
- <i>Chloe?</i>

47:24.560 --> 47:27.632
- Daryl, Jesus! Where the hell are you? <i>
- I don't have time to explain that</i>
 <i>right now. You all right?</i>

47:27.720 --> 47:31.713
- Miss Kent, remember what I said.
- No. I got a million cops asking me questions, Daryl.

47:31.800 --> 47:35.236
I don't know if you're alive. 
I don't know if you're dead. I don't know 
what's happening to our lives.

47:39.440 --> 47:42.079
- Okay, partner, we're in business.
- You guys wanted lunch?

47:42.160 --> 47:44.993
- Whoa, ho, ho. We almost got this.
- I got the prefix.

47:45.080 --> 47:46.957
Look. Does the word Pentium
mean anything to either one of you?

47:47.040 --> 47:49.429
Will you get this away from the equipment,
please? Take it away from the equipment.

47:49.520 --> 47:51.909
- Is Martinez still there with you?
<i>- Yeah. </i>

47:52.000 --> 47:54.878
- Don't stay on the phone too long. <i>
- Chloe, I know all this doesn't</i>
 <i>make sense to you right now. </i>

47:54.960 --> 47:57.758
- <i>But I promise you,</i> <i>it's all 
gonna be fine. </i> - Stay on the line.

47:57.840 --> 48:00.479
- Stay on the line. Don't hang up.
- Daryl, I'm scared.

48:00.560 --> 48:03.313
- You better hang up the phone.
- Quiet, quiet, quiet! Okay, I got the fourth digit.

48:03.400 --> 48:06.437
I promise, it's all
gonna work out fine.

48:06.520 --> 48:08.351
- Stay on the line. Stay on the line.
- You better hang up.

48:08.440 --> 48:10.271
- Stay on the line.
- Baby, I love you.

48:10.360 --> 48:12.510
- Five digits! - I love
you too. - Hang it up.

48:12.600 --> 48:14.397
- Six digits. - Now.
- One more thing.

48:14.480 --> 48:17.233
Hang up the damn phone!

48:19.360 --> 48:23.717
You know, you like a piece of faeces
with peanuts... a pain in my ass.

48:26.080 --> 48:30.471
- I see you brought your little
 white girlfriend with you. - Shut up!

48:30.560 --> 48:32.676
Probably been on the phone
with McCready, huh?

48:32.760 --> 48:35.399
Probably told you I was on a 5150.
Mm-mmm.

48:35.480 --> 48:38.119
It's a 1718.
I don't even know what that is.

48:40.400 --> 48:43.153
You know what that is? What is it?

48:43.240 --> 48:46.755
- A button?
- No. It's a transmitter.

48:49.120 --> 48:53.955
- What is it? What is it?
- A pager.

48:54.040 --> 48:57.510
No. This is a tracking device.

48:57.600 --> 49:01.229
That's how I knew where you were
every time you made a move!

49:01.320 --> 49:03.595
Why do you think I had us change
clothes at Penn Station...

49:03.680 --> 49:08.754
under the auspices
of being a criminal, mister?

49:08.840 --> 49:12.515
And the dog... Oh, the dog is the centre
of this entire investigation.

49:12.600 --> 49:15.034
Oh, yeah.
You didn't know that, did you?

49:15.120 --> 49:18.749
- No. I was under the auspices that 
it was a tracking device. - Shut up.

49:18.840 --> 49:20.990
Get up. You coming with me. Get up!

49:24.120 --> 49:27.669
Ooh, ooh, I'm sorry. You may want
to hold on to that tracking device.

49:27.760 --> 49:30.957
That's all right.
I can throw a bullet at you.

49:31.040 --> 49:33.634
Don't you go nowhere.
You wait right there.

49:33.720 --> 49:38.111
Baby, you keep guard, all right? Hey, wait
a minute, fool! Come here! Hold on, mister!

49:40.000 --> 49:43.310
<i>I threw a ring down the toilet</i>

49:43.400 --> 49:45.994
<i>'Cause that's</i>
<i>where our love went</i>

49:50.840 --> 49:54.071
All right. Let me guess.
Somebody tried to kill you.

49:54.160 --> 49:56.594
T.J. McCready miraculously
shows up and shoots him.

49:56.680 --> 49:59.353
- Yep. That's it.
- That's the oldest trick in the book, man.

49:59.440 --> 50:01.635
At the Bureau,
we call it the double take.

50:01.720 --> 50:03.551
If you'd have looked twice,
you'd have seen what really happened.

50:04.840 --> 50:07.115
- So that didn't really happen?
- Nah. It's all smoke and mirrors.

50:07.200 --> 50:10.954
See, Thomas Chela is Minty Gutierrez.
They're one in the same.

50:11.040 --> 50:14.112
The Gutierrez drug cartel ring a bell?
He's the guy with the glass eye...

50:14.200 --> 50:18.352
floatin' all over his shit, kind of got
that Sammy Davis thing happening, man.

50:18.440 --> 50:22.877
Hey, wait a minute. You mean
Don Carlos Cola is a drug front?

50:22.960 --> 50:26.032
Exactly. Governor Quintana was working
with the United States Government.

50:26.120 --> 50:29.157
I get the drop that somebody's
tryin' to assassinate him...

50:29.240 --> 50:33.472
get there a couple of minutes late,
get caught on camera inside his house.

50:33.560 --> 50:36.916
Thus the dilemma I find myself in
at this particular junction.

50:37.000 --> 50:41.471
- Man, you didn't even do this then.
- Hell, no. I didn't murder nobody, unfortunately.

50:41.560 --> 50:44.836
Governor Quintana, he was trying to slow
the drug flow into the United States.

50:44.920 --> 50:46.478
I mean,
how good is that for the kids?

50:48.160 --> 50:50.116
- That's some serious shit, Freddy.
- Yeah. No shit.

50:50.200 --> 50:51.553
- You're being framed.
- Exactly.

50:51.640 --> 50:53.551
By the same people
that are trying to frame you.

50:53.640 --> 50:56.518
- You FBI. You can go talk to them. They can clear me. 
They can clear you.- No, no, no, no.

50:56.600 --> 51:00.878
This is my point exactly. The FBI
has no jurisdiction in Mexico.

51:00.960 --> 51:04.873
I'm not even supposed to be playin'
right now. This is some rogue shit.

51:04.960 --> 51:09.317
- You lookin' at a rogue.
- Fred, I had... I had no idea.

51:09.400 --> 51:11.152
- You a rogue.
- A rogue.

51:14.160 --> 51:16.435
- Rogue.
- Don't patronize me, man.

51:16.520 --> 51:18.556
I'm sorry. My bad.

51:19.720 --> 51:24.589
You just a big rogue.
I won't p-patronize you, you big rogue.

51:32.120 --> 51:34.111
- All right. See you later, rogue.
- Man, you might want to listen...

51:34.200 --> 51:37.112
to some of this shit
if you want to live past tomorrow.

51:37.200 --> 51:41.876
- You ain't goin' nowhere without me.
- <i>With an IQ of a tree</i>

51:41.960 --> 51:48.991
<i>Honey, that ain't all</i>
<i>You've seen the last of me</i>

51:49.080 --> 51:50.957
Yeah!

51:52.400 --> 51:56.188
I'm sorry, man. Really. I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I've been... I've been rude.

51:56.280 --> 51:59.272
- He fits the description.
- I'm gonna call it in.

52:11.440 --> 52:13.351
Shit on a stick!

52:23.600 --> 52:25.591
What the hell?

52:30.840 --> 52:33.115
Shit.

52:33.200 --> 52:35.953
Get this gun out of my ass!

52:41.000 --> 52:44.993
You've got to admit,
that "rogue" shit was pretty... Aw, shit!

52:46.440 --> 52:48.670
- Your dumb dog bit me!
- That's what you get.

52:57.280 --> 53:01.592
- Damn! You got sheriff crackers out 
there thinkin' that you're me. - What?

53:20.960 --> 53:24.509
Damn it, Molly Jo!
Mike, how'd you get out of the pen?

53:24.600 --> 53:27.398
You shit in that pool,
and you're gonna end up lunch meat.

53:34.880 --> 53:37.474
Shit! It's the Pepsi truck!
Shit!

53:38.880 --> 53:40.711
Shit! Shit!

53:42.000 --> 53:44.309
Mother's Cookies!
Mother's damn Cookies!

53:49.280 --> 53:51.714
Fiji Water. Damn Fiji Water.

54:00.240 --> 54:02.708
Freddy, when McCready gets here,
this is all over. Will you calm down?

54:03.760 --> 54:06.593
Those are McCready's men out there.
Don't you get it?

54:12.080 --> 54:14.833
- What are you doin'?
- Calling a strike team.

54:14.920 --> 54:19.755
Find the right goddam pen,
have a strike team here in 30 seconds.

54:19.840 --> 54:22.718
Coming soon: <i>The Black Rogue. </i>

54:31.280 --> 54:35.558
Joe, Steven, get those trucks out
of here. Luther, come with me.

54:35.640 --> 54:38.712
"Dear Strike Team.
It's me, Freddy.

54:38.800 --> 54:43.430
Send help soon.
Signed, Rogue. "

54:43.520 --> 54:48.913
- Move it out! - You ain't gonna think
everything's so damn funny in just about a minute.

54:50.400 --> 54:52.595
Gunfire!

54:53.520 --> 54:55.715
Hey! Gunfire!

54:56.880 --> 54:59.155
Come on, Tiffany!

54:59.240 --> 55:02.710
I am not Freddy Tiffany!
I am not Freddy Tiffany!

55:08.000 --> 55:13.632
<i>I fall to pieces</i>

55:13.720 --> 55:15.756
We got a border to cross!

55:17.040 --> 55:19.952
- I'm Freddy Tiffany! I'm Freddy Tiffany!
- Hell, yes, you are!

55:20.040 --> 55:22.713
Get me out of here!

55:24.440 --> 55:30.549
<i>I fall to pieces</i>

55:30.640 --> 55:33.552
Oh, shit!

55:33.640 --> 55:38.156
<i>How can I be just your friend</i>

55:38.240 --> 55:44.315
- What the...
- <i>You want me to act</i>

55:44.400 --> 55:47.551
- <i>Like we've never kissed</i>
- Let's go, bitch.

55:47.640 --> 55:51.872
<i>You want me to forget</i>

55:51.960 --> 55:54.394
<i>Pretend we've never met</i>

55:54.480 --> 55:58.189
- You'd better be worth a lot of damn money;
 that's all I can say.
- You mother...

55:58.280 --> 56:04.196
<i>And I try and I try</i>
<i>but I haven't yet</i>

56:04.280 --> 56:11.277
<i>You walk by</i>
<i>and I fall to pieces</i>

56:12.440 --> 56:15.398
<i>You walk by</i>

56:15.480 --> 56:19.519
<i>And I fall to pieces</i>

56:21.920 --> 56:23.353
We made it, baby!

56:32.720 --> 56:36.235
Hey, man, what's goin' on?

56:36.320 --> 56:39.232
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's my meal ticket, there!

56:39.320 --> 56:42.710
I'm sorry about this mess, but I know
you know where them big-booty bitches...

56:44.240 --> 56:47.710
Get off of me!
Don't tell me to shut up!

56:47.800 --> 56:49.950
- You don't know who I am.
- Put him back in here with Daddy.

56:51.600 --> 56:54.672
Now, listen, Mr. Funny Man.
Enjoy your visit, huh?

56:56.160 --> 56:58.151
Okay. I'm going.

57:01.640 --> 57:03.551
Kiss my ass, Paco!

57:28.040 --> 57:31.191
Come in, Mr. Tiffany!
Come in!

57:31.280 --> 57:34.795
Step into my office.
Sit down.

57:38.840 --> 57:40.831
Have a cigar, Mr. Tiffany.
Here.

57:40.920 --> 57:42.797
Here. Go on. Go on.
Have a cigar.

57:43.880 --> 57:46.348
Here. Very good.

57:46.440 --> 57:48.874
Go ahead. Go ahead. Huh?

57:52.360 --> 57:57.115
You have no idea what it means
to meet you, Mr. Tiffany.

57:57.200 --> 58:00.670
This is a great moment.

58:00.760 --> 58:03.513
I take it you and Governor Quintana
weren't exactly friendly.

58:03.600 --> 58:06.160
Oh, I loved Governor Quintana!

58:06.240 --> 58:09.915
He was a great man
who was trying to make a difference.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.198
Oh, that is, of course, why he
bought the farm, as you <i>Americanos</i> say.

58:15.440 --> 58:20.150
But he will always be held
in the warmest place of my heart.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.594
Let me ask you something,
<i>Capitán. </i>

58:24.680 --> 58:26.875
What? Wh-What is that?

58:26.960 --> 58:31.238
You all smiling at me like I'm Regis
and I got a million dollars.

58:31.320 --> 58:33.959
- Very funny.
- What's up with that?

58:34.040 --> 58:37.191
That is because there will
be promotions for all of us.

58:37.280 --> 58:41.319
You know...
the men who captured you.

58:44.640 --> 58:48.918
Well, before you boys break out the
pinatas and start drinkin' tequila...

58:50.040 --> 58:52.235
- I'd like to make my phone call.
- Huh?

58:52.320 --> 58:56.359
My phone call.
To T.J. McCready with the CIA.

58:57.440 --> 58:59.795
I think he'll explain
who I really am.

58:59.880 --> 59:02.519
A phone call?
You want to make a phone call?

59:08.160 --> 59:10.469
He wants to make a phone call!

59:11.640 --> 59:14.757
This is not America,
my friend.

59:14.840 --> 59:16.831
You do not get a phone call.

59:19.280 --> 59:22.556
Next, you will be wanting us
to call Johnnie Cochran, huh?

59:32.400 --> 59:35.472
Wh-What is this?

59:35.560 --> 59:38.074
- I'm not Freddy Tiffany.
- What?

59:38.160 --> 59:41.755
I'm Daryl Chase. Looks like
Foghorn Leghorn over here screwed up.

59:41.840 --> 59:43.796
I say... I say,
ain't that right, boy?

59:51.400 --> 59:53.516
What is the meaning
of all of this?

59:53.600 --> 59:55.875
Now, hold on. Just wait a second here.
Let me think.

59:55.960 --> 59:59.873
You realize I can bring you up
on charges for trying to trick me?

59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.393
- Now, wait a goddam minute.
- Huh?

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.959
- I am tellin' you, he...
- Boss, boss.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.155
- What?
- Really?

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.275
Well, we shall see.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.394
There is somebody here
to see you.

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:25.995
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.150
- Who?
- Your senorita.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.396
Federico.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:40.438
- Wait. I know you, right?
- You know me?

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:44.115
You know me? Well, I should hope so
that you know me.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.679
Look, I don't know what's with the
accent, but we met at the La Perla party.

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.832
No, we did not meet at La Perla.
We met at the other place.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.956
- You know what I'm talking about.
- I'm Daryl Chase.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:00.511
- You are not Daryl Chase! You are Federico!
- No, no. No, see, I'm Dar...

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.717
We met at the La Perla party.
Remember?

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.917
- I don't know her.
- Well, you... you just said you did.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.956
Okay. We met at a party...

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:14.273
I met her, but I don't, you know, know
her, you know, in the biblical, like she...

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.794
You know me!
You know me <i>mucho</i> times, okay?

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.075
- <i>Mucho</i> times.
- I don't know this girl.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.351
- Why? Why are you doing this to her?
- Look. I don't know...

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.510
what greasy, grubby nigga she been
laying up in the bed with.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.273
- I ain't got nothin' to do with this.
- That is not a very nice thing to say.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:33.113
I'm not lyin'!
I do not know her!

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.788
Captain...

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.678
I never talked
to this "macarena" girl!

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.512
I love you, Freddy!

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.637
This a bad time
to talk about that reward?

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.271
Don't worry about a thing, girl.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.875
'Cause when we get to Mexico,
I'm a Mexican and you a chihuahua.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:03.748
So you gotta learn how to <i>habla Espanol</i>
when we get there, you know.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:11.389
Hey, girl. Look at this:
An invasion of Texas.

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.792
Hey, y'all have a good time in America!
And my name is Paco if anybody asks.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.235
Bark in Spanish.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.959
Well, that was good, girl. Sure you
ain't got no chihuahua in you?

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.751
I mean,
how hard can this be?

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.870
On our way to <i>Mexico. </i>

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.513
Oh, hell, yeah. We cruisin', baby.
Look at that. Yeah, this is good.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.636
Oh, shh...

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.234
Shit!

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.959
Delores!

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:01.437
Delores!
I see you, baby! Here I come!

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.553
Hang in there, girl. Ah.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.349
Ah, I told you Daddy'd be here.
Ai-yai-yai.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.915
It's my baby. Thank you.
Thank you.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.309
- 'Preciate it. 'Preciate it.
- No, no, no, no.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.713
No, no, no.
Black man going to Mexico.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.678
Y'all can go to Compton.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.354
I'm going to Mexico!
Look.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.635
Over that way! No!

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.392
U.S.A.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:41.315
Me and the dog can take all y'all. Bring it
on! Bring it on! Watch it, baby. Bite 'em!

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.551
Keep missin' with me.
All of ya. No. Look out.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.869
- Here you go, Mr. Allsworth.
- Hmm? Thank you.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:57.999
- Mm-hmm. - This is a good
thing you're doing, Chloe.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.355
The CIA won't let anything
happen to him.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.556
You're doin' the right thing
by helpin' us out.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.949
I'll do whatever it takes.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:13.551
I ain't gettin' out!
Yeah, drop me off right here!

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.991
Thanks for the ride, suckers!

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.791
Shit.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:46.677
Hello, Mr. Chase.
I trust you had a pleasant trip.

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:50.029
- You have no idea.
- I've come to get you out of here.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.839
Let's go.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.357
Thanks, man.

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.719
Shit.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.314
Daryl, wait up. I need to step over here
and take care of some paperwork...

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.914
and get your things, and then you can
tell me about everything.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.468
The sooner I get out of here,
the better.

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:12.518
- What happened to your leg?
- A dog bit me.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.635
Oh. Here you go, amigo.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.517
Freddy Tiffany.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:30.439
Let me guess.
Somebody tried to kill you.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:33.080
T.J. McCready miraculously
shows up in the nick of time...

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.435
and shoots him.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.435
Shit.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:55.756
And the dog? Oh, the dog is the centre
of this entire investigation.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.150
Shit.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.640
Shit.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.631
Shit.

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.750
Hey, Martinez.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.959
Daryl, you want to step over here
and sign out?

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.513
Daryl?

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.111
- Where is he? Where did he go?
- Who?

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.236
Chase. He made me.
He's on the move.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.709
- We didn't see him.
- He's on foot. He's running. Let's go.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.677
What in the shit were y'all doin'?
Let's move it.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.637
We gotta find him.
We gotta find him. We gotta find him.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.989
Oh! Sorry.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.792
Don't move!
Now, you heard me. Don't move.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:18.751
- Freddy?
- Yeah, it's me.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.995
Hey, hey, hey.
It's gonna be all right.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.674
All right?
I'll get you through this.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.832
- I thought you was crazy.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, look.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.832
- We gotta get the hell out of here.
- No, no. I gotta get to New York.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:40.832
McCready's dirty like you said.
Martinez left Chloe.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:42.831
- I don't know if she's dead.
- Look, look, look. She's gonna be fine.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:46.230
Chloe's going to be fine. Remember
my partners Norville and Gradney?

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.788
Partners? Wait, wait, wait.
The drug dealers?

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.633
They're FBI agents. They've
been down with me the whole time.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.676
It's a covert operation.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.352
Let's get the hell out of here before
we end up with bullets in our head.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.351
Oh, shit!

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.069
Down, bitch!

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:12.312
- Do I look like I'm goddam moving?
- I'm talking to the goddam dog!

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.718
- Who is that?
- Oh, you're gonna like this.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.519
Oh, yeah? What am I gonna
like about this?

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.955
The new guy,
bought and paid for.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.952
Send him up, Minty.
Send him up.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:41.959
I can't begin to tell you how you guys
have screwed things up for me.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.635
You are a bunch of stupid,
incompetent jackasses...

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.792
who don't know
how to do a simple job.

01:08:51.439 --> 01:08:53.749
And you...

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.479
If you are any indication
of the efficiency...

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.198
of the Central Intelligence Agency,
let me tell you, my friend:

01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:02.192
Your government is in deep water.

01:09:02.279 --> 01:09:04.919
Minty, in every operation
there are a couple of snags.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.877
You go off like a loose cannon,
kill Governor Quintana...

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:11.635
get bit by his dog and have
the stupidity to leave it behind...

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.438
connecting you to the crimes
and me as well.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.590
And you call that "snags"?

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.718
And you...

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:25.759
You assured me
that my money was safe...

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.796
safe from prying eyes.

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:31.667
Well, Minty, it was,
until you transferred $ 106 million...

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.796
into your account
in a single day.

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.791
Daryl would've had
to be dead not to catch it.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.916
See, Minty? A snag.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.676
Minty, I will handle your accounts
personally if things get any worse.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:45.194
And exactly how much worse
are they supposed to get?

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:49.113
- I can handle Daryl.
- That time is all passed now.

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:55.195
I am going to take care
of Daryl myself, my way.

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.316
Oh, hey,
I don't like the sound of that.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.995
- That is music to my ears.
- Gentlemen.

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.594
- Hi, baby.
- Come here.

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.557
- What happened to you?
- Stinkin' mutt bit me.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.710
Damn thing's bitin' everybody,
right?

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.075
Yeah. That little furball
has got sharp teeth.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.989
Minty, I'd like
for you to meet Agent Gradney, FBI.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:23.995
Let me guess, huh? You...
You want a piece of the action, hmm?

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:27.277
- I'm worth it.
- Yeah? Show me how you're worth it.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.397
Well, why don't we ask Maque here.

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:32.994
- Isn't that right, sweet thing? - Hey.
Wh-Wh-What do you think that you're doing, huh?

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:37.756
She's Tiffany's partner.
Always has been.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.637
She was a plant
from the beginning.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.838
Now, that bite mark's the only thing
that connects you to this murder.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.277
We make sweet thing disappear here,
along with that stinkin' mutt...

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:51.079
FBI doesn't have much of a case,
now, do they?

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:54.038
Whoa. You are better
than I thought.

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:07.038
Damn!
Elliot was a good man...

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.270
and there wasn't too many good men
at the Bureau.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:13.114
They put me on a 5150
because I give a damn.

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.990
I'm sorry
about your friend, man.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.832
There's somebody special in there
I want to get out.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.434
It's payback time.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:56.473
- No wonder the Bureau kicked him out.
- Hey, hey, hey. Watch it. Slow!

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:59.757
I am Freddy Tiffany, FBI!

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.838
- Oh, look at that fool.
- Lookie here. Lookie here.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.593
Keep your hands off me! You know
damn well you got orders not to shoot.

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:10.070
You know what's goin' down?
I'm going to arrest all you crackers.

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.991
- You can believe that and then some.
- Hey, Tiffany.

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.150
- What?
- I think you forgot about me.

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.359
- No, I didn't.
- Freeze! Freeze.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.874
You, I'm just going to kill.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.713
Martinez, drop your gun.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.711
Drop it.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.629
- You all right, baby?
- I'm better now.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.836
Get your ass over there.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.311
You, Jones!
Get your bitch ass over there!

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:41.517
- Daryl, handle your business.
- Here, sweetie.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.556
Thank you, baby.
You know how I like silver guns.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.790
T.J., where is Chloe?

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.075
Banker boy, how do you plan
on gettin' out of here?

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.789
Your life is worth less
than a Mexican food stamp right now.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:56.510
I'm going to ask you again.
Where is Chloe?

01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:00.070
Eh, Mr. Chase,
Chloe is in perfect health.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:03.391
If you don't believe me, take a look
out that window. See for yourself.

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.675
- Please.
- Thomas...

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.958
if I don't like what I see,
you're all dead men.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:14.238
- Daryl, this is not like you.
- I think the brother means business.

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.629
Put your hands
where I can see 'em!

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.715
- Hey, baby!
- Well, what did you expect, huh?

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:34.033
Your girlfriend in chains and shackled
in a deep, dark wine cellar, huh?

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.793
We are all civilized here,
Mr. Chase.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.519
- What about Governor Quintana?
- Unfortunately...

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.275
Quintana didn't want to be part
of our happy little family.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.432
That's why I'm sure you both
will be more cooperative than he was.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.795
More cooperative?

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.356
C.A., you piece of shit.
You were like a father to me.

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:56.477
Well, you're still like a son
to me, Daryl.

01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:00.553
That's why all of this can
be resolved very simply and cleanly.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.953
- C.A., shut up.
- Hey, uh, Minty. I got a question.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.636
How is it you can afford the CIA,
a banker from Wall Street...

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.358
but you can't seem
to buy a better eye...

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.635
than that marble
you got rollin' around in your skull?

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:19.310
- Oh, you got some balls, Tiffany.
- That's what your mama said.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.710
Okay, Minty. Enough
of this cops-and-robbers bullshit.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.032
- Call in the guns.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:30.112
- I beg your pardon?
- I have always known...

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.634
that Maque Sanchez
was with the FBI.

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:37.794
God, Charles,
I have got well over $600 million...

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.714
in your American banks right now,
which your government has frozen.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.872
The only chance I have of ever
recovering any of my money...

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.829
is to turn all of you over
to the Justice Department...

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:53.435
which Mr. Tiffany and Miss Sanchez
happen to be members of.

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:58.673
My God. You set me up. That's
why you made that goddam deposit.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.399
- You started all of this.
- Ah, that's right.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:04.313
And you clowns just confessed
to everything we need.

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:08.717
Considering the caliber
of your work...

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:12.588
you are all lucky to be able to walk
out of here with your lives.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:15.433
Betrayal. Ain't it a bitch?

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:19.070
- Drop the gun, or I'll kill her. -
Put it down. - I swear I'll kill her.

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.276
- Drop the gun, Tiffany.
- Put the gun down now.

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.430
- Tiffany, you son of a bitch, I'll kill her!
- Put it down!

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.715
- Will you stop it, Freddy?
- Drop the gun. - Put it down!

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.598
- Shut up! - Put it down
now! - Goddam it, Freddy!

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:30.910
- Put your gun down! - I'll kill
her! - You want to go there with me?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.513
- Relax! - I'll kill
her! - Let's go there!

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:33.999
- Freddy! - Me
and you! - Shut up!

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.149
- Shoot him! - Huh?
What? - Shut up!

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:37.993
- Freddy! - I'll roll you like a 
Philly blunt and smoke your bitch ass!

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.873
They shot Minty!

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.476
Cover me, baby.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.711
Cover me!

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.470
Clear! Come on!

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.715
- Martinez?
- What?

01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.280
- You play golf, right?
- What?

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:04.319
I know your families used to run around
with leaf blowers cuttin' lawns.

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.517
- But you play golf, right?
- No, man.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:09.158
Why don't you come out here
and show me?

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:11.913
Well, here's a little lesson
from Tiger.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.069
Fore!

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.271
Yeah, he's dead.
Just about out of here.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:41.109
You really are from the projects.
You didn't hit a damn thing.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:47.077
Now, let me show you how a shooter
never, ever misses.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:52.553
Oh, no!

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.596
Oh! Oh!

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:04.388
He wasn't lying.
He didn't miss once.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.751
Looks like it's the last one.

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:12.674
They're going to hang a sign over
your cell: "Over one billion served. "

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:21.879
- You never know, do you?
- Hello, Daryl.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.555
Chloe.

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.870
Shari?

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:31.713
Sorry, Daryl.
We had to get you out of New York.

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.677
It was our only way
to flush out T.J. McCready...

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:36.877
and connect him with Charles Allsworth
and Gutierrez.

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:43.277
- So they're... they're with...
- They're all with me.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:47.114
Just one big, happy FBI family.

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.476
I trusted you, and you...
you used me.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.516
We did what we had to
to save your life.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:59.393
Daryl, baby, it's over,
all right? And we're safe.

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:12.229
- Can I hug an FBI agent?
- No. But you can hug a friend.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.470
That'll work.

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:20.070
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:25.798
- Take care of yourself.
- No doubt.

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.149
You still got a phat ass.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.714
Freddy, I can't believe
you're from Malibu.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.439
Malibu High. Class of'84.

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.557
- Oh, he's so cute.
- Thank you.

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:48.553
Then I went to Hawaii. I was on the pro
surf circuit for about three years.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.155
Hey, hey, hey.
Your brother came in first.

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:56.074
Brother from Malibu.
Chloe, look at this.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:58.196
- Oh, what's so funny?
- Nothin'.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.919
- I know you're not laughin' at my man.
- Have you seen this?

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.911
Yes, I have.
I think he looks cute.

01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.592
Thank you.

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:09.150
Okay, baby. Okay.
It's all right.

01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:15.714
Hey, uh... uh, Daryl,
you didn't touch that, did you?

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:18.360
Oh, this?

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.910
Yeah, I know. It can scramble
a strike team in less than 30 seconds.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:41.519
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>nobody else but you</i>

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:45.070
Oh, see?
See what I'm talkin' about?

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:49.631
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>nobody else but you</i>

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:56.758
Go in! Go in! Go in!

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.354
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:15.477
<i>Don't care</i>
<i>if the bank was free</i>

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:21.029
Hey, fellas! Stand down!

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:32.359
<i>Shake, shake</i>
<i>Shake, shake your body</i>

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:43.554
<i>Shake, shake</i>
<i>Shake, shake your body</i>

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:45.631
Compliments of Freddy Tiffany.

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:52.552
- <i>Why you lie to me</i> - <i>You may not 
know me</i> <i>but I know you very well</i>

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:55.677
