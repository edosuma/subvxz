Peter, I do my Jane Fonda workout tape
three times a week.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.829
When was the last time you saw your toes?

10:20.913 --> 10:23.457
I thought you people were
supposed to be jolly.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.834
Peter, what the hell is the
matter with you?

10:25.918 --> 10:29.046
Honey, if there's something wrong,
you can tell me.

10:29.171 --> 10:33.050
-Sorry, man. Am I late? What did I miss?
-Thank God you're here. What do I do?

10:33.133 --> 10:35.385
Tell him to keep quiet. He's in too deep.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.095
I don't know.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.555
Where's the other guy?

10:38.639 --> 10:39.765
[Cars honking]

10:39.848 --> 10:41.391
This is unbelievable!

10:42.392 --> 10:45.687
I promise you, everything's fine.
You got nothing to worry about.

10:45.771 --> 10:48.941
STEWIE: Well, well, Mother!
We meet again!

10:49.024 --> 10:51.568
Stewie, I thought
I tucked you in an hour ago.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.821
Not tightly enough it would seem.
And now you contemptible harpy...

10:54.905 --> 10:57.366
...I shall end your reign
of matriarchal tyranny.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.409
LOIS: You can play tomorrow, honey.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.119
Right now it's bedtime.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.164
Blast you and your estrogenical treachery!

11:04.248 --> 11:05.541
PETER: Sweet dreams, kiddo.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.042
You have the power to end this!

11:10.087 --> 11:11.463
How'd she take it?

11:11.547 --> 11:13.465
I told her she was fat.

11:13.549 --> 11:14.842
No.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.302
I hate lying to Lois. It's just....

11:17.386 --> 11:19.513
It's the best way to keep
her from the truth.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.099
You have no choice.
Your unemployment will dry up soon.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.602
She'll probably sense something's amiss
when they repossess your house.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.938
You really oughta think
of your family's welfare.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.523
Jeez, Brian! That's a great idea!

11:31.692 --> 11:35.946
Okay, do you have any disabilities,
past injuries, physical anomalies?

11:36.655 --> 11:39.324
I didn't have gas
for the first time until I was 30.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.578
[Breaks wind]

11:43.787 --> 11:45.706
What the hell was that?

11:47.249 --> 11:50.586
PETER: Guys, our money problems are over!
We're officially on welfare.

11:50.669 --> 11:53.130
Come on, help me scatter car parts
on the front lawn.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.381
How much are we getting?

11:54.464 --> 11:56.758
Let's see. $150 a week.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.011
Wait. That's a comma, not a decimal.

11:59.261 --> 12:00.888
[Uplifting instrumental music]

12:01.180 --> 12:02.181
Whoops.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.808
No, I haven't seen Peter all afternoon.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.518
I was giving a piano lesson.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.563
Stewie, why don't you play
in the other room?

12:09.646 --> 12:11.023
Why don't you burn in hell?

12:11.815 --> 12:13.483
No dessert for you, young man.

12:14.026 --> 12:16.528
Who would've thought getting drunk
would get me...

12:16.612 --> 12:19.489
...$150,000 a week from the government?

12:19.615 --> 12:20.866
This is why I don't vote.

12:20.949 --> 12:23.285
Maybe somebody down there
was drinking, too.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.788
Mr. President, why do you think
the public supports you...

12:26.872 --> 12:28.582
...during these impeachment proceedings?

12:28.665 --> 12:30.167
Probably because you're so fat.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.879
Peter, you might want to call
the Welfare Commission.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.881
That check is obviously an oversight.

12:35.964 --> 12:39.510
Not necessarily. Maybe I'm like
their one millionth customer.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.678
BRIAN: What?
You're gonna spend $150,000 a week?

12:41.762 --> 12:43.847
-Yeah.
-On what?

LOIS: Oh, my God!
Peter, you bought the statue of David?

12:48.810 --> 12:51.313
No. I just rented it.
But they're gonna be ticked.

12:51.396 --> 12:54.066
The penis broke off
while I was loading it into the car.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.946
I shall call you "Eduardo."

12:59.196 --> 13:00.948
Peter, how can we afford this?

13:01.073 --> 13:03.033
You won't believe it, Mom!
Dad's getting--

13:03.116 --> 13:04.243
A big raise!

13:04.326 --> 13:06.036
Peter, that's wonderful!

13:06.119 --> 13:07.120
But, Dad, I thought--

13:07.204 --> 13:10.457
The kind of raise that'll allow me
to give my kids a big allowance...

13:10.541 --> 13:13.085
...just for keeping their big mouths shut.
Come on, guys.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.629
I'll buy us
the most expensive meal we've ever had.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.716

13:26.682 --> 13:28.517
Peter, what's the big surprise?

13:28.600 --> 13:31.603
You know how I always said
you should be treated like a queen?

13:31.687 --> 13:33.605
I got you your own jester.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.483
JESTER: Good to be here in New England.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.652
And what's the deal
with "New" England anyway?

13:38.735 --> 13:43.073
It's over 200 years old!
Last time I checked, that's not that new.

13:47.661 --> 13:48.662
This is great.

13:48.745 --> 13:52.374
I can finally afford to give my little

But I only did it for you and the kids.

14:42.633 --> 14:45.511
Except for the jukebox in the bathroom.
That was for Peter.

14:45.594 --> 14:49.765
Yeah, from the American taxpayers.
I am so mad I can't see straight.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.892
No problem.
We got money to get that fixed...

14:51.975 --> 14:54.144
...with enough left for us
to buy our way

might get into.

even know you anymore, Peter.

he could fix a problem...

would be one of her buttons?

in the john if your wife's mad at you?

that money to the taxpayers.

Compared to that,

feels that way.
