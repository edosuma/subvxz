00:19.152 --> 00:22.883
<i>- We will make no distinction-</i>
<i>- The U.S.S.</i> Cole
<i>was attacked while refueling-</i>

00:22.956 --> 00:24.821
This was an act of terrorism.

00:24.891 --> 00:27.325
It was a despicable and cowardly act.

00:27.394 --> 00:30.886
The next number we're gonna play for you
is one of the good ol' favorites.

00:30.964 --> 00:33.432

<i>I-I'm just making sure</i>

00:38.405 --> 00:41.033
<i>We got a plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:42.409 --> 00:43.967
<i>...thousands of people running-</i>

00:44.044 --> 00:46.342
We must, and we will...

00:46.413 --> 00:47.971
remain vigilant at home and abroad.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.514
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

00:57.824 --> 01:00.019
<i>Fuckl I missed something once before.</i>

01:00.093 --> 01:03.119
<i>I won't- I can't let that happen again.</i>

01:05.364 --> 01:07.959
<i>It was 10 years ago.</i>
<i>Everyone missed something that day.</i>

01:08.034 --> 01:10.696
<i>Yeah, everyone is not me.</i>

01:10.770 --> 01:12.032
<i>Once you've gotten to this position.</i>

01:19.546 --> 01:21.343
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland.

01:21.414 --> 01:24.975
You're telling me the fucking C.I.A.
Thinks I'm working for Al-Qaeda?

01:25.051 --> 01:27.042
<i>I think you're working for Al-Qaeda.</i>

01:27.120 --> 01:30.021
<i>- Ask me anything.</i>
<i>- What goes on in your garage?</i>

01:30.090 --> 01:32.991
Why do you go there so late at night,
so early in the morning?

01:33.059 --> 01:34.117
To pray.

01:34.194 --> 01:35.684
You're a Muslim?

01:35.762 --> 01:38.230
Why did they kill Walker and not you?

01:38.298 --> 01:40.129
I killed him.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.327
- <i>Who told you to kill him?</i>
- <i>Abu Nazir.</i>

01:42.402 --> 01:44.529
- <i>So you did meet him.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:44.604 --> 01:46.970
- If you want to arrest me,
you can come to my house.
- No. Brody!

01:47.040 --> 01:48.735
We were wrong about Brody.

01:48.808 --> 01:51.242
<i>A P.O.W.</i> was <i>turned. It wasn't him.</i>

01:51.311 --> 01:53.472
Aileen just I.D.'d Tom Walker.

01:53.546 --> 01:56.879
- Tom Walker died.
- No. He's the terrorist.

01:58.251 --> 02:00.344
Tom was dead. That's what they told me.

02:00.420 --> 02:03.218
What we need to do is find him
before anything happens.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.348
Oh, baby, I've done a horrible thing.

02:05.425 --> 02:08.656
- No, Helen, no. Don't!
- They're tracing this call!
You got to get out of there!

02:11.331 --> 02:12.525
Gun!

02:14.334 --> 02:17.394
The tac team followed Walker here.
Two casualties.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.597
Local Muslims here for morning prayer.

<i>pictures of himself to a number</i>

02:27.747 --> 02:32.241
He'll be gone in two days.
I have an idea who might replace him.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.719
- Are you crazy?
- You people told me Walker was dead.

02:35.788 --> 02:37.551
I don't-

02:37.624 --> 02:39.285
My friend!

02:39.359 --> 02:41.884
You told me I killed him.

02:41.961 --> 02:44.521
- You made me believe!
- I don't know!

02:44.597 --> 02:47.532
Really! You have to talk to Abu Nazir!

02:49.469 --> 02:53.530
I'm through talking with Nazir.
Tell him it's over.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.469
Hey, Jess. It's me.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.065
I'm in the store. What's-

03:30.143 --> 03:32.668
I think it says Vitamin Water.

03:32.745 --> 03:35.270
What is that, some kind of medicine?

03:35.348 --> 03:38.442
If you get this in the next few minutes,
will you call me back? Thanks.

03:48.828 --> 03:50.659
You finish your homework?

03:50.730 --> 03:55.099
I just can't believe that Tom Walker
is really actually alive.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.693
I know. It seems crazy.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.795
What's Dad say?

03:59.872 --> 04:02.466
So far, not a whole lot.

04:02.542 --> 04:06.103
- Well, have you even asked him?
- Yes, Dana, of course I've asked him.

04:06.179 --> 04:10.275
He can't believe it.
He says there's gotta be some mistake.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.614
It's not the first time
the F.B.I. Have gotten it wrong.

04:12.685 --> 04:14.448
Yeah, but what if they're right?

04:14.520 --> 04:18.616
Two marines are captured,
and one comes back a terrorist?

04:20.360 --> 04:22.328
Dad must be going out of his mind.

04:22.395 --> 04:25.125
Did you find everything
you were looking for today, sir?

04:25.198 --> 04:27.325
- Yes. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:29.535 --> 04:31.730
- Just one thing.
- Yeah.

04:31.804 --> 04:34.830
- What does that say?
- Vitamin Water.

04:34.907 --> 04:37.740
- What is that?
- It's-lt's good. It's like flavored water.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.802
Would you like me to get
someone to find it for you?

04:41.381 --> 04:43.076
What flavor?

04:43.149 --> 04:45.014
I don't know. What you got?

04:45.084 --> 04:46.517
Um-

04:46.586 --> 04:48.850
Hey. You're that marine
war hero guy, right?

06:02.729 --> 06:05.197
We have nothing to do
but pray for our brothers...

06:05.264 --> 06:07.494
that they will go into heaven for God.

06:07.567 --> 06:10.593
The F.B.I. Said
that they were fired at first-

06:10.670 --> 06:12.103
which is a lie.

06:12.171 --> 06:14.639
The truth is they shot and killed...

06:14.707 --> 06:17.437
two innocent people in a house of worship,
without provocation.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.034
Hey.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.512
What about
the man they were chasing- Tom Walker?

06:21.581 --> 06:23.742
- What do you know about him?
- All any of us know...

06:23.816 --> 06:25.716
is that a stranger
ran through our mosque...

06:25.785 --> 06:29.050
being chased by F.B.I. Agents while we
were gathering for morning prayers.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.716
Have you been told the
names of the agents who fired the shots?

06:31.791 --> 06:33.588
No, we're still awaiting
a full investigation.

06:33.659 --> 06:36.253
We don't know anything yet.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.991
No, sir. We do not condone hate.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.999
Or violence.

06:42.368 --> 06:44.336
Ms. Mathison.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.372
Special Agent Hall.

06:46.439 --> 06:49.806
I asked to meet the SWAT team commander,
the man who was on the ground for this.

06:49.876 --> 06:52.310
And you got me. His boss.

06:52.378 --> 06:56.212
- How can I help?
- Would you mind taking
your shoes off, please?

07:01.187 --> 07:03.155
What are we doing here exactly?

07:03.222 --> 07:05.122
Everything we can to catch Walker.

07:05.191 --> 07:08.183
You're aware there's an F.B.I.
Manhunt up and running.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.424
All 56 field offices, canceled leave-

07:11.497 --> 07:13.692
The reason why I asked to meet
the actual SWAT commander...

07:13.766 --> 07:16.428
is because I need him to walk me
through exactly what happened here.

07:16.502 --> 07:18.333
Which he already did with me.

07:18.404 --> 07:22.898
So, Walker comes in from the alley,
through this door here.

07:22.975 --> 07:26.877
And we already know he was armed,
because he stole a gun from one of your men.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.538
And?

07:28.614 --> 07:30.411
Did Walker open fire first?

07:31.117 --> 07:32.641
Yes.

07:32.718 --> 07:35.710
Yet the imam is standing
out there telling the world that's a lie.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.848
The imam? That's his word against mine.

07:38.925 --> 07:41.689
He also says that neither
he nor any of his flock know Walker.

07:41.761 --> 07:43.422
Which is not true.

07:43.496 --> 07:45.589
Do you want to know why?

07:45.665 --> 07:48.099
- Please.
- Then walk with me.

07:49.735 --> 07:53.831
He hauls ass down these stairs
to a service corridor that goes left...

07:53.906 --> 07:55.737
to a janitor's storage room...

07:55.808 --> 07:59.471
or right, doubling back underneath the
building to a Bilco door on Raum Street...

07:59.545 --> 08:01.809
all the way on the east side
of the building.

08:01.881 --> 08:04.349
Son of a bitch goes right.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.510
He knew exactly
where the fuck he was going.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.952
You following me on this so far?

08:09.021 --> 08:11.649
- He knows this mosque.
- Correct.

08:12.892 --> 08:15.588
And probably a lot of people
that come here too.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.720
<i>As-salaam alaikum.</i>

08:43.789 --> 08:46.053
<i>Alaikum salaam.</i>

08:46.125 --> 08:49.754
Imam, let me begin by saying
how deeply sorry I am for your loss.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.626
Losses. Plural.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.961
There were two dead.

09:00.973 --> 09:02.668
Lmam, my name is Carrie Mathison.

09:02.742 --> 09:06.075
Another government official here to
suggest that if we weren't all guilty...

09:06.145 --> 09:08.477
one way or another,
none of this would have happened, right?

09:16.789 --> 09:21.351
I'm also well aware of your
good work in this neighborhood,
beyond just here in the mosque.

09:21.427 --> 09:23.759
Then you should know
how violated we all feel.

09:23.829 --> 09:25.490
I do. Yes.

09:25.565 --> 09:29.968
I have seven eyewitnesses,
including myself, who saw what happened.

09:30.036 --> 09:33.494
Please forgive me,
but my job right now- my only job-

09:33.573 --> 09:36.098
is to catch this man Walker
as soon as possible.

09:36.175 --> 09:38.439
He did not fire
a single shot at the agents.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.775
He was moving too fast,
trying to get away from them.

09:40.846 --> 09:43.644
Either Walker was very lucky to get away
as quickly as he did...

09:43.716 --> 09:46.776
or he knew this mosque
well enough to use it as an escape route.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.546
I have families to comfort.

09:50.623 --> 09:52.591
I have funerals to arrange.

09:52.658 --> 09:55.718
I have a community who believes they will
never get justice for what happened.

09:55.795 --> 09:59.526
If you do know Walker,
or anything about him...

09:59.599 --> 10:01.999
or anyone who might...

10:02.068 --> 10:05.629
whatever you tell us, no matter how small,
would be in total confidence.

10:06.906 --> 10:09.136
And yet you offer me nothing in return.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.210
What do you mean by that?

10:12.278 --> 10:14.246
Specifically. Just so I'm clear.

10:14.313 --> 10:18.477
Two families will get no justice, unless
the F.B.I. Tells the truth...

10:18.551 --> 10:22.180
about how they killed two innocent people
who were doing nothing but pray.

10:23.723 --> 10:25.714
In other words, you <i>do</i> know something.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.456
Good-bye, Ms. Mathison.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.395
Mr. Galvez.

10:35.835 --> 10:37.803
He knows Walker. You saw that, right?

10:37.870 --> 10:40.134
- I'm not crazy?
- You're not crazy.

10:40.206 --> 10:43.437
I don't give a shit what it takes-
that imam is gonna talk to me.

10:43.509 --> 10:45.704
What it takes?
He wants a full F.B.I. Mea culpa.

10:45.778 --> 10:47.803
Good luck with that.

10:50.016 --> 10:53.247
It's not medicine. It's a drink.

10:53.319 --> 10:57.346
Dana likes the "Revive" flavor,
and Chris likes the "Energy" one.

10:57.423 --> 10:59.482
And Dana's been asking a lot
about Tom Walker.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.856
It's all over the Internet,
and I don't really have any answers...

11:01.927 --> 11:03.952
so if you can come home
as soon as you can-

11:04.030 --> 11:08.524
Oh, I told Chris that I would take him to a
movie if he got all his homework done today.

11:08.601 --> 11:14.233
He specifically asked if you would
come too, so just call me back. Okay?

12:53.773 --> 12:56.367
This is your new home now.

13:09.822 --> 13:11.653
Come.

15:09.608 --> 15:11.633
This is Issa, my son.

15:22.454 --> 15:23.978
<i>As-salaam alaikum.</i>

15:25.824 --> 15:29.555
Issa.

15:32.898 --> 15:34.490
Issa.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.994
<i>Wa alaikum assalam.</i>

15:39.338 --> 15:42.899
I want him to learn English- fluently.

15:42.975 --> 15:46.809
You will live here with him
as long as it takes.

16:09.835 --> 16:12.030
I have no clue how to do this.

16:13.505 --> 16:15.496
I'm not a teacher.

16:43.035 --> 16:45.026
- We have a problem.
- Hey.

16:45.104 --> 16:48.562
What, are you stalking me now?
How'd you find me here?

16:49.808 --> 16:52.436
- They spent years training me.
- Ah.

16:52.511 --> 16:56.242
- So, what's the problem?
- The imam.

16:56.315 --> 16:59.079
- He'll calm down in a day or two.
- I don't have a day or two.

16:59.151 --> 17:01.585
- He says your men fired first.
- I know what he's saying.

17:01.653 --> 17:03.678
He has seven eyewitnesses,
including himself...

17:03.756 --> 17:06.247
saying Walker didn't shoot
or even raise a weapon at them.

17:07.826 --> 17:08.815
And?

17:10.628 --> 17:13.119
I believe he's withholding
information about Walker.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.462
Well, you people have
rubber hoses, don't you?

17:15.534 --> 17:17.968
He's a good man caught in a bad situation.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.973
He runs a mosque that a terrorist suspect
used as an escape route.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.339
He wants justice for the men
who were killed...

17:24.410 --> 17:26.742
for which I think he'll tell me
what he knows about Walker.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.210
Justice?

17:30.282 --> 17:32.011
What does that mean?

17:32.084 --> 17:36.180
Well, for one thing,
it means compensation for the families.

17:36.255 --> 17:41.056
Look, if one of your men made a mistake,
you need to come clean.

17:41.126 --> 17:44.459
Let me ask you something.
Have you ever been in a firefight?

17:44.530 --> 17:46.020
Yes.

17:48.967 --> 17:51.026
Okay.

17:52.204 --> 17:54.502
So, my men follow
an armed terrorist suspect...

17:54.573 --> 17:56.632
based off intel provided by you people...

17:56.708 --> 18:00.269
at zero dark 30 into a fucking building
that they don't even know is a mosque.

18:00.345 --> 18:03.371
In seconds, a member of the team
thinks he has a clear shot...

18:03.449 --> 18:05.917
at bringing down a terrorist,
and he takes it.

18:05.984 --> 18:09.385
Accidentally,
he drops two civilians in the cross fire.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.218
Shit happens.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.816
But if you think that I or the Bureau...

18:14.893 --> 18:18.624
are gonna let the C.I.A. Come in
and throw any of my guys under the bus...

18:19.498 --> 18:21.762
you're fucking high.

18:41.053 --> 18:45.217
Hey. Hey, Issa.
Come closer. Don't be afraid.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.019
Come on.

18:47.092 --> 18:49.151
Wanna play?

18:53.599 --> 18:56.090
Hey. Hey, you know how to do this?

19:00.072 --> 19:02.472
Can you do this? Yeah?

19:03.642 --> 19:06.076
You want to learn?

19:08.347 --> 19:10.315
Yeah?

19:11.683 --> 19:13.446
Look. Soccer ball.

19:13.519 --> 19:15.350
It's a soccer ball.

19:15.420 --> 19:18.218
Soccer.
Can you say that? Soccer.

19:18.290 --> 19:19.382
Socce-

19:20.859 --> 19:21.883
Hey.

19:23.729 --> 19:26.493
Hey. Hey, Issa.

19:27.199 --> 19:28.689
Hey, wait.

19:30.602 --> 19:35.733
<i>Accidentally, he drops two</i>
<i>civilians in the cross fire. Shit happens.</i>

19:35.807 --> 19:38.799
<i>But if you think that I or the Bureau...</i>

19:38.877 --> 19:42.904
<i>are gonna let the C.I.A. Come in</i>
<i>and throw any of my guys under the bus...</i>

19:42.981 --> 19:45.381
<i>you're fucking high.</i>

19:46.919 --> 19:51.117
You're really fucking something, Carrie.
I gotta hand it to you.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.387
There is no bridge you won't burn,
no earth you won't scorch.

19:54.459 --> 19:56.393
When it comes to catching Walker...

19:56.461 --> 19:58.793
or any terrorist suspect for that matter,
damn straight.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.832
You recorded a senior F.B.I. Agent...

20:00.899 --> 20:03.493
who thought he was talking off the record
to someone on the same side...

20:03.569 --> 20:06.367
so you could leverage
the F.B.I. Into admitting a mistake.

20:06.438 --> 20:08.770
Are you really prepared
to sacrifice the very agency that...

20:08.840 --> 20:11.775
with all their manpower,
is the best chance we have to get Walker?

20:11.843 --> 20:14.641
They accidentally
shot and killed two people.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.614
Now, I get that it's not easy,
or even ideal...

20:17.683 --> 20:20.811
but we need to convince them to just
make a statement taking responsibility.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.649
For what?

20:22.721 --> 20:26.782
The hope that this imam will give you
information that you don't even know he has?

20:26.858 --> 20:29.759
No disrespect, David, but I think
I've been in the field long enough...

20:29.828 --> 20:32.092
to know a source when I see one.

20:36.468 --> 20:39.028
You will not- I repeat- not...

20:39.104 --> 20:42.938
do anything to sabotage
the F.B.I. Manhunt for Walker.

20:43.008 --> 20:44.805
That is a direct order.

21:07.232 --> 21:09.223
What happened here?

21:11.803 --> 21:14.636
I was showing him a trick with the ball...

21:14.706 --> 21:16.901
and I, uh- I knocked over some glasses.

22:06.391 --> 22:08.450
What the hell...

22:08.527 --> 22:11.428
- are you doing, Carrie?
- What? Nothing.

22:13.598 --> 22:15.793
The last I checked, this was my office.

22:15.867 --> 22:20.736
Just- I needed
somewhere private to calm down.

22:20.806 --> 22:22.467
Somewhere private?

22:22.541 --> 22:24.702
Okay, so I was hoping you'd be here.
Where have you been?

22:25.877 --> 22:29.278
I just heard about the imam and the F.B.I.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.077
Estes is right.

22:31.149 --> 22:35.381
That imam knows Walker.
I fucking know it, 100%.

22:35.454 --> 22:38.651
- You think the imam's bad?
- No. No. That's the problem.

22:38.724 --> 22:43.024
He's practically a saint. I've got nothing
on him. I've got zero leverage.

22:43.095 --> 22:46.360
- You're 100% sure he's not bad?
- Pretty much.

22:52.304 --> 22:53.999
So?

22:55.540 --> 22:58.065
Maybe you're approaching
the problem the wrong way around.

23:27.773 --> 23:29.536
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

23:29.608 --> 23:31.701
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

23:33.145 --> 23:35.409
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

23:35.480 --> 23:37.641
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

23:40.619 --> 23:44.180
We want justice! We want justice!

23:49.761 --> 23:51.729
So what are we doing here?

23:51.797 --> 23:53.788
I think they call it a Hail Mary.

23:55.867 --> 23:58.301
We want justice! We want justice!

24:04.376 --> 24:06.003
<i>As-salaam alaikum.</i>

24:06.077 --> 24:07.567
<i>Wa alaikum assalam.</i>

24:07.646 --> 24:10.638
- My name is Carrie.
- I know who you are.

24:10.715 --> 24:13.047
May I come in?

24:13.118 --> 24:15.052
I need to speak with your husband.

24:24.896 --> 24:26.887
Please, have some tea.

24:32.204 --> 24:34.399
I'm sorry. This isn't easy.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.100
I understand.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.501
Imam, I've done my research.

24:39.578 --> 24:41.546
I know of your work in the community-

24:41.613 --> 24:45.709
the woman's refuge you run with Father
Rose from Saint Agnes down the street.

24:45.784 --> 24:49.083
I have no doubt you and I
want the same thing.

24:49.154 --> 24:52.954
- Which is a better world.
- And a better America.

24:55.327 --> 24:59.627
If there's another terrorist attack,
this country is primed to turn on itself.

24:59.698 --> 25:02.223
You and I both know
we're halfway there already.

25:03.969 --> 25:06.767
But if an attack happens
that can be traced back to information...

25:06.838 --> 25:09.932
that you chose to withhold
when you were given the chance...

25:12.344 --> 25:13.834
the mosque...

25:15.113 --> 25:18.048
this community that you worked
so hard to build-

25:19.885 --> 25:22.046
they'll put a match to it all.

25:25.724 --> 25:28.989
Our only hope- and it's a good one-

25:29.060 --> 25:33.121
is that people like us put our heads
together and help each other.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.894
Now, I need to find Tom Walker.

25:38.637 --> 25:40.400
Will you help me?

25:43.842 --> 25:48.142
I pray what you say about another attack
on America is wrong.

25:48.213 --> 25:51.444
But you're right.
It takes more than just prayer.

25:51.516 --> 25:53.450
We have to help each other.

25:55.320 --> 25:57.345
Action speaks louder than words...

25:57.422 --> 26:00.118
yet so far you've done nothing but talk.

26:01.493 --> 26:03.290
What were you expecting?

26:03.361 --> 26:05.852
It's very simple- truth.

26:08.233 --> 26:11.202
Two people were tragically caught
between a terrorist suspect...

26:11.269 --> 26:14.170
and those whose job it is
to stop more attacks on America.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.673
That is the truth.

26:17.909 --> 26:20.173
I know you know Walker.

26:24.282 --> 26:26.614
Please.

26:30.855 --> 26:33.881
If I say I have no information,
I have no information.

26:33.959 --> 26:35.449
I'm sorry.

26:52.744 --> 26:54.541
In case you reconsider.

26:58.984 --> 27:00.645
Thank you for the tea.

27:00.719 --> 27:02.209
<i>As-salaam alaikum.</i>

27:07.559 --> 27:10.585
We want justice! We want justice!

27:15.700 --> 27:17.395
How'd it go?

27:19.304 --> 27:23.035
The F.B.I. Better fucking find Walker.
That's all I can say.

28:01.980 --> 28:05.746
"A man wants to build a home for his wife.

28:05.817 --> 28:08.115
He loves his wife.

28:08.186 --> 28:11.622
The house must be strong
to keep them safe."

28:13.291 --> 28:15.452
Issa, that is amazing.

28:16.628 --> 28:19.153
To be able to do that this quickly?

28:20.999 --> 28:23.331
It's truly excellent.

28:43.321 --> 28:45.414
Sometimes, I swear to God...

28:45.490 --> 28:47.822
people are their own worst enemy.

28:47.892 --> 28:50.190
<i>Yeah, tell me about it.</i>

28:50.261 --> 28:52.320
What are you doing, Saul?
You sound kind of-

28:52.397 --> 28:55.491
What do we know about Walker?
We know he's a sniper.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.330
Snipers are trained to go to ground...

28:57.402 --> 29:00.496
either in plain sight or,
as is the case here...

29:00.572 --> 29:02.335
that doesn't work...

29:02.407 --> 29:04.773
<i>they blend into the wild.</i>

29:04.843 --> 29:07.073
I think the other word
for that is "disappear."

29:07.145 --> 29:09.010
Hold on a second.

29:11.282 --> 29:12.772
Hello.

29:12.851 --> 29:16.309
Carrie, this is Zahira.

29:16.387 --> 29:19.322
<i>Can you meet me in 15 minutes?</i>

29:19.390 --> 29:21.858
Yeah, of course.

29:39.377 --> 29:40.867
Hey there.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.845
Whoa. Whoa. I come in peace.

29:44.649 --> 29:46.981
My bad. I didn't mean to
sneak up on you like that.

29:47.051 --> 29:49.952
- Don't worry about it.
- May I?

29:50.021 --> 29:52.046
Sure.

29:52.123 --> 29:55.650
That sure is some
work of art you got there.

29:55.727 --> 29:58.662
What is that, some sort of limited,
made-to-measure edition?

29:58.730 --> 30:00.197
Something like that.

30:02.767 --> 30:05.497
- Nice. What you hunting?
- Office supplies.

30:05.570 --> 30:08.698
What you got there?

30:08.773 --> 30:11.367
Marlin 336 with a Vari-X.

30:11.442 --> 30:14.343
- Yeah. Gets the job done.
- Oh, it'll get her done.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.645
It sure is a beautiful day for it.

30:17.715 --> 30:19.876
You, uh- You have yourself a good one.

30:19.951 --> 30:21.885
Want to see this thing in action?

30:21.953 --> 30:23.682
Just about got it in the sweet spot.

30:25.056 --> 30:27.081
Sure. Sure. Why-Why not?

30:51.049 --> 30:52.880
I didn't get your name.

30:52.951 --> 30:55.476
It's, uh, Dan.

30:55.553 --> 30:57.282
Name's Dan.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.414
Good talking to you, Dan.

30:59.490 --> 31:01.424
Good luck out there.

31:01.492 --> 31:04.052
Right. Y-You too.

31:11.536 --> 31:13.367
Hello, Zahira.

31:13.438 --> 31:15.269
When you came to our home...

31:15.340 --> 31:20.368
you knew it was not permitted
for you to be alone with my husband.

31:20.445 --> 31:23.778
Two pairs of ears to hear what you had
to say being better than one.

31:25.416 --> 31:26.508
Maybe.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.679
I love my husband, Carrie.

31:29.754 --> 31:33.349
- He's a good man.
- I don't doubt it.

31:39.764 --> 31:45.225
I understand what you said about
this country- the knife edge it's on.

31:45.303 --> 31:46.930
Please.

31:47.005 --> 31:50.236
I need your word that
you will not say anything...

31:50.308 --> 31:52.299
to anyone about our meeting.

31:52.377 --> 31:54.641
You have it.

31:57.215 --> 31:59.183
This man Walker-

31:59.250 --> 32:03.346
over the last few weeks,
he has come to the mosque maybe...

32:03.421 --> 32:05.548
eight or nine times.

32:05.623 --> 32:09.787
Every time he meets with a man
who does not come to the mosque to pray.

32:09.861 --> 32:12.329
Just to do business.

32:12.397 --> 32:14.194
Do you know the name of this man?

32:15.600 --> 32:19.730
All I know is he drives a car
with the diplomatic plates.

32:20.471 --> 32:21.961
Which country?

32:25.143 --> 32:26.667
S-Saudi Arabia.

32:29.347 --> 32:30.837
Thank you.

32:58.910 --> 33:00.707
Bad dream?

33:00.778 --> 33:02.746
Yeah.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.907
Yeah, it was.

33:10.188 --> 33:12.179
Hey, what you got there?

33:16.594 --> 33:19.495
Hey, this is beautiful, Issa.

33:19.564 --> 33:21.555
This is really great.

33:24.535 --> 33:26.469
Thank you.

33:44.622 --> 33:47.420
What is this? What's going on?

34:19.489 --> 34:21.617
<i>Nicholas?</i>

34:22.760 --> 34:25.159
<i>Can you hear me, Nicholas?</i>

34:25.228 --> 34:27.219
<i>Nicholas.</i>

34:29.766 --> 34:32.167
Yeah, I can hear you.

34:32.235 --> 34:33.965
<i>You're angry.</i>

34:34.038 --> 34:36.370
How the fuck do you think I feel?

34:37.308 --> 34:39.367
<i>You're also in shock.</i>

34:41.411 --> 34:45.143
<i>Which is why you told our friend in</i>
<i>Washington to tell me that it's all over.</i>

34:45.216 --> 34:50.244
I've been living the last eight years
thinking I killed Tom Walker...

34:50.321 --> 34:52.516
which I now find out is not true.

34:52.590 --> 34:55.684
Which means everything I did-
everything-

34:55.760 --> 34:58.354
<i>Is the peace you found</i>
<i>in Islam a false peace?</i>

34:58.429 --> 35:00.329
Everything I believed in.

35:00.398 --> 35:04.596
<i>You believed in Allah's forgiveness and,</i>
<i>through Allah's mercy, in yourself.</i>

35:04.669 --> 35:06.466
It was all a trick.

35:06.537 --> 35:08.402
It was based on a lie.

35:08.473 --> 35:11.533
<i>I did not let you</i>
<i>actually kill your friend.</i>

35:12.410 --> 35:14.742
<i>Isn't that good news?</i>

35:23.421 --> 35:25.412
What is Walker doing?

35:27.024 --> 35:28.389
<i>Helping.</i>

35:28.459 --> 35:30.256
<i>That's all you need to know.</i>

35:33.998 --> 35:36.262
<i>You remember the new beginning</i>
<i>you were given?</i>

35:36.334 --> 35:38.859
Yes. I remember.

35:38.936 --> 35:40.528
<i>Issa.</i>

35:43.441 --> 35:46.001
You trusted me with Issa.

35:46.077 --> 35:47.374
Why?

35:47.445 --> 35:50.414
<i>Why not trust a man</i>
<i>who would rather die...</i>

35:50.481 --> 35:52.506
<i>than give information to his enemy?</i>

35:52.583 --> 35:56.178
You got your enemy to teach your own son.

35:56.254 --> 36:00.213
<i>No, we only began as enemies...</i>

36:00.291 --> 36:03.055
<i>because that's what others told us to be.</i>

36:04.295 --> 36:06.388
<i>Are we enemies now?</i>

36:09.967 --> 36:12.265
<i>Have you forgotten?</i>

36:17.708 --> 36:20.677
Buy me some peanuts...

36:20.745 --> 36:23.236
and Cracker Jack.

36:23.314 --> 36:27.148
I don't care...

36:27.218 --> 36:29.948
- if I never get back.
- Get back.

36:30.021 --> 36:34.788
I want to root, root, root for-

36:34.859 --> 36:36.724
For the home team.

36:38.429 --> 36:42.092
Finish it. Come on, brat.
You're almost done.

36:42.166 --> 36:47.297
Let me root, root, root for the home team.

36:47.371 --> 36:50.966
If they don't win, it's a shame.

36:51.042 --> 36:55.502
For it's one, two,
three strikes, you're out...

36:55.580 --> 36:59.607
at the old ball game.

37:02.787 --> 37:04.618
You a brat.

37:04.689 --> 37:08.591
- You <i>are</i> a brat.
- You <i>are</i> a brat.

37:08.659 --> 37:10.820
And you're gonna be late for school.
Get out of here.

37:16.867 --> 37:20.303
Hey. Are you forgetting something?

37:21.706 --> 37:23.799
Score a goal today.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.280
Issa!

37:40.358 --> 37:42.383
...Issa?

37:42.460 --> 37:44.758
... Issa?

37:45.563 --> 37:47.053
Issa!

37:49.166 --> 37:50.929
Issa!

37:51.002 --> 37:52.993
Mama!

37:54.705 --> 37:56.468
Issa!

37:58.609 --> 38:01.737
Issa!

38:26.070 --> 38:28.595
Issa!

38:39.817 --> 38:41.284
Issa?

38:49.927 --> 38:51.792
Issa?

38:52.663 --> 38:54.995
Issa.

38:55.066 --> 38:56.556
Issa?

38:56.634 --> 38:58.864
Issa.

39:01.572 --> 39:03.938
Issa.

39:08.946 --> 39:11.380
Issa!

40:57.188 --> 40:59.452
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

40:59.523 --> 41:01.457
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

41:07.865 --> 41:10.493
<i>I pray every day...</i>

41:10.568 --> 41:14.402
<i>that you never lose sight of what you</i>
<i>committed to do in Issa's name.</i>

41:17.308 --> 41:21.005
<i>I never wanted or planned any of this.</i>

41:21.078 --> 41:26.015
<i>It was your choice- doing what you are</i>
<i>doing after what happened that day.</i>

41:27.618 --> 41:29.245
<i>But...</i>

41:30.421 --> 41:32.651
<i>in the end, you are...</i>

41:33.390 --> 41:35.585
<i>a soldier, as you say.</i>

41:37.495 --> 41:40.157
<i>And you will either</i>
<i>stay truthful to that...</i>

41:40.231 --> 41:42.199
<i>and do what you feel is right...</i>

41:43.000 --> 41:45.195
<i>or you will not.</i>

41:46.604 --> 41:48.538
Alhamdulillah.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.569
Nazir?

41:54.645 --> 41:56.169
Nazir?

42:03.554 --> 42:06.955
Nazir said that you would remember this
from two years ago.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.428
<i>At 4:42 p.m. Local time...</i>

42:11.495 --> 42:14.328
<i>a drone missile hit and destroyed</i>
<i>part of a compound...</i>

42:14.398 --> 42:16.423
<i>120 miles northeast of Mosul...</i>

42:16.500 --> 42:18.400
<i>in the mountains of northern Iraq...</i>

42:18.469 --> 42:21.632
<i>from which Abu Nazir,</i>
<i>the leader of the I.P.L.A...</i>

42:21.705 --> 42:23.673
<i>is believed to have been operating.</i>

42:23.741 --> 42:27.177
<i>The images being broadcast</i>
<i>on some news outlets around the world...</i>

42:27.244 --> 42:31.237
<i>of the bodies of 83 dead children</i>
<i>allegedly killed in the strike...</i>

42:31.315 --> 42:33.647
<i>we believe to be false...</i>

42:33.717 --> 42:36.242
<i>created by the terrorists</i>
<i>for propaganda purposes.</i>

42:37.288 --> 42:40.018
And they call us terrorists.

42:40.090 --> 42:43.856
<i>...all that can be done</i>
<i>is done to protect the innocent.</i>

42:45.362 --> 42:48.456
<i>Make no mistake-</i>
<i>that in the planning of these missions...</i>

42:48.532 --> 42:52.024
<i>all that can be done is done</i>
<i>to protect the innocent...</i>

42:52.102 --> 42:55.833
<i>in particular,</i>
<i>the precious lives of children...</i>

42:55.906 --> 42:59.808
<i>while we keep our promise to hunt down</i>
<i>the terrorists who continue to plot against-</i>

43:02.079 --> 43:04.343
As you already know,
that man there, the vice president...

43:04.415 --> 43:08.374
is the former director of the C.I.A.
And the man most instrumental...

43:08.452 --> 43:10.682
in the drone attack
that killed young Issa.

43:10.754 --> 43:13.814
As he prepares to become president...

43:13.891 --> 43:16.792
he's going to want to use you,
to be seen with you...

43:16.860 --> 43:19.454
his American hero, more and more.

43:19.530 --> 43:21.054
Let him.

43:21.131 --> 43:23.531
We also believe that...

43:23.601 --> 43:27.037
he's going to ask you
to run for political office.

43:27.104 --> 43:30.232
Say yes. This will be
a signal to Abu Nazir...

43:30.307 --> 43:33.799
that you are committed
still to doing this.

43:52.930 --> 43:55.228
Oh, Jesus.

44:15.219 --> 44:17.449
The doctor says you should
take these with food.

44:22.526 --> 44:25.654
Go out the back way. Take a right.

44:25.729 --> 44:29.756
Your car is across the street.
The groceries are inside.

45:22.052 --> 45:23.178
Ow.

45:40.771 --> 45:44.138
That's it on the left,
home of our Saudi diplomat.

45:47.544 --> 45:49.603
Diplomatic fucking immunity.

45:49.680 --> 45:51.511
Just like Klaus in '03.

45:51.582 --> 45:54.779
That was the Swiss embassy in Caracas,
and we nearly let Klaus slip away.

45:54.852 --> 45:57.286
I'm not losing this guy, Saul.

45:58.622 --> 46:00.783
For now, we wait and see
if Mr. Zahrani does anything...

46:00.858 --> 46:03.588
or goes anywhere
that'll help us get to Walker.

46:03.660 --> 46:05.787
You live for this shit.

46:07.865 --> 46:09.856
So I've been told.

46:18.642 --> 46:22.373
What if Mr. Zahrani doesn't give us
anything anytime soon?

46:22.446 --> 46:26.177
We figure out an elegant way
to lift and interrogate him.

46:50.073 --> 46:52.303
I'm not gonna ask you
where you've been all day.

46:52.376 --> 46:55.243
I know you have a lot on your mind
and a lot to process...

46:55.312 --> 46:57.337
and I'm in danger
of sounding like a broken record-

46:57.414 --> 47:00.008
Oh, my God. What happened?

47:00.083 --> 47:02.313
- I got mugged.
- What do you mean, mugged?

47:02.386 --> 47:05.219
As in attacked and robbed.

47:05.289 --> 47:09.919
- Are you all right? Did you call the cops?
- What good are the cops gonna do?

47:09.993 --> 47:13.485
By the time I came round,
the fuckers that did this were long gone.

47:13.564 --> 47:18.968
- Where did this happen?
- Grocery store parking lot.
Three of the bastards.

47:19.036 --> 47:21.027
I-I'm fine. I'm fine.

47:21.104 --> 47:24.267
I went to the, uh-
I went to the emergency room.

47:24.341 --> 47:26.571
- Why didn't you call me?
- They got my phone.

47:26.643 --> 47:29.737
I didn't want to worry you and the kids.

47:29.813 --> 47:32.873
Seriously, it's no big deal.

47:32.950 --> 47:35.714
- Are you hurt?
- Ah, a couple broken ribs.

47:35.786 --> 47:39.745
It- Hey, hey. I'm fine. I'm fine.

47:39.823 --> 47:42.587
All right?

47:42.659 --> 47:45.492
Fuck, Brody.
You should've called the cops.

47:45.562 --> 47:48.429
Well, I really don't need
the attention right now.

47:48.498 --> 47:50.762
What else did they take?

47:50.834 --> 47:53.667
Oh, a few bucks, my pride.

47:55.239 --> 47:57.400
Well, you're all right.
That's what's important.

47:57.474 --> 47:59.203
Mm-hmm.

47:59.276 --> 48:02.268
You know what the worst part of it is?

48:02.346 --> 48:05.611
I really wanted to spend the day
with you and the kids.

48:08.018 --> 48:10.885
I want us to spend more time together-

48:10.954 --> 48:12.979
as a family.

48:13.056 --> 48:15.547
That sounds so good.

48:22.566 --> 48:26.297
Eight years out there, I come back,
I get mugged outside the grocery store.

48:26.370 --> 48:28.998
It's unbelievable.

48:29.072 --> 48:31.836
America's a violent country.
What can I tell you?

48:34.077 --> 48:36.170
Oh.

48:36.246 --> 48:39.147
- I'm sorry. Oh. And guess what.
- What?

48:39.216 --> 48:41.184
There's a message on the voice mail-

48:41.251 --> 48:43.242
from the vice president's office.

49:20.223 --> 49:21.212
English - US
