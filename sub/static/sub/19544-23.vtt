00:10.803 --> 00:13.545
Damn, this is irritating.

00:13.764 --> 00:16.050
None of this fooling around matters!

00:16.265 --> 00:18.257
I want to put an end to this right now,

00:18.477 --> 00:21.514
so I can hurry up and settle the score with you!

00:21.730 --> 00:26.599
Having sensed the evil in Vegeta's heart,
Dabra abandoned the fight.

00:26.819 --> 00:29.310
Babidi exploited Vegeta,

00:29.530 --> 00:33.523
scheming to make him
fight Goku and the others.

00:34.952 --> 00:35.816
Vegeta!

00:36.036 --> 00:39.369
This is Babidi's magic!
Please, quiet your heart!

00:39.581 --> 00:44.621
The magic of Madoshi Babidi,
who is seeking to revive Majin Boo,

00:44.837 --> 00:48.546
has made even Vegeta its captive.

00:49.591 --> 00:53.334
Good! Good! You are now my servant.

00:53.554 --> 00:57.263
All right, why don't we put you
in an ideal place to fight?

01:05.441 --> 01:11.937
A warrior, steeped body and soul in evil,
is about to attack Goku!

02:46.124 --> 02:52.620
"I Am the Strongest!
The Clash of Goku vs. Vegeta."

03:06.854 --> 03:08.344
H-Hey!

03:10.899 --> 03:12.810
What?!

03:13.026 --> 03:14.527
You dumbass!

03:43.891 --> 03:46.098
Aw, crap!

03:46.310 --> 03:47.800
Oh, no!

04:03.744 --> 04:05.985
--W-We're gonna get killed!
--Help!

04:06.204 --> 04:10.948
--Help!
--Somebody help!

04:16.298 --> 04:18.709
W-What's the matter with you, Vegeta?!

04:18.926 --> 04:21.918
--Move it! Don't push!
--Why is Vegeta acting like this?

04:22.137 --> 04:24.753
I've never felt a Ki like this before!

04:37.110 --> 04:38.611
Vegeta!

04:58.966 --> 05:02.629
Good! Good! That's a couple
of hundred people dead!

05:37.879 --> 05:41.167
V-Vegeta-san! How could you do that?!

05:56.982 --> 05:58.893
What shall we do, Mister Satan?

05:59.109 --> 06:01.225
W-What do you expect me to do?!

06:01.445 --> 06:03.561
Save us, Satan!

06:03.780 --> 06:05.361
Defeat that guy for us, Satan!

06:05.574 --> 06:07.656
Satan! Let him have it!

06:11.038 --> 06:14.246
Mister Satan! Or rather, Champion!

06:15.959 --> 06:19.247
That's right. I am the world champion.

06:19.463 --> 06:22.955
No matter who my enemy may be,
I cannot very well run away!

06:23.175 --> 06:26.963
H-H-Hey, you!

06:27.179 --> 06:29.465
Just what do you think you're doing?! Eh?!

06:32.517 --> 06:36.601
a-and l, the world champion,
Mister Satan, will...

06:36.813 --> 06:39.099
Mister Satan will...

06:44.446 --> 06:45.982
Satan will...

06:46.198 --> 06:48.063
What will you do?

06:52.162 --> 06:54.619
Okay, you guys! Violence won't do!

06:54.831 --> 06:58.119
Fight fairly, rather than smashing things up!

06:58.335 --> 07:01.998
Whoever wins, I will let you
have a special match with me--

07:02.214 --> 07:03.704
Hey!

07:05.467 --> 07:08.425
What will it be, Kakarrot?

07:18.313 --> 07:20.895
Come on, fight me.

07:21.108 --> 07:24.851
Unless you want the heap of bodies
to grow even higher, that is.

07:26.321 --> 07:29.484
Vegeta, don't tell me...

07:32.077 --> 07:36.036
Don't tell me you intentionally
submitted to Babidi's spell.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.281
No way...!

07:42.129 --> 07:44.120
Answer me, Vegeta!

08:34.681 --> 08:37.092
Please, stop this, Vegeta-san!

08:37.308 --> 08:39.799
Move it!

08:40.020 --> 08:45.185
Keep out of this, guppy!
This fight is between Kakarrot and me!

08:45.400 --> 08:48.767
Vegeta... Whatever it takes, huh?

09:03.501 --> 09:05.537
No, you mustn't, Son Goku-san!

09:05.754 --> 09:08.917
If you fight him here,
you play right into Babidi's hand!

09:09.132 --> 09:14.502
Your energy will be absorbed,
and Majin Boo will be revived for sure!

09:14.721 --> 09:19.511
Vegeta, you intentionally
fell under Babidi's spell,

09:19.726 --> 09:25.892
and gave up your self-control,
just to make me take you seriously.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.017
Am I wrong?!

09:27.234 --> 09:29.646
H-He did what?!

09:29.861 --> 09:33.524
|f| hadn't done this,
you wouldn't have fought me.

09:33.740 --> 09:37.904
You only have one day before
you leave this world forever,

09:38.119 --> 09:40.952
but then this got in our way.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.904
Th-That is why...

09:43.124 --> 09:46.457
That is the whole reason why
you committed this foolish stunt?!

09:48.088 --> 09:50.249
Foolish stunt?!

09:50.465 --> 09:55.880
Foolish stunt, you say?!

10:00.100 --> 10:05.640
This is everything to me!
I don't give a damn about Majin Boo!

10:05.855 --> 10:09.598
He-- He surpassed my strength!

10:09.818 --> 10:13.902
He's a Saiyan, like me,
and yet he pulled ahead of me!

10:14.114 --> 10:19.108
Me, the prince, who prides himself
on his overwhelming power!

10:20.370 --> 10:24.363
|-|'ve even had my life saved by him before!

10:24.582 --> 10:27.665
A-Am I supposed to stand for that?!

10:27.877 --> 10:29.788
Not a chance!

10:39.931 --> 10:44.300
Babidi! Change us to someplace
where there ain't nobody around!

10:44.519 --> 10:47.886
I've decided to fight Vegeta!

10:54.070 --> 10:55.981
Look! We did it! We did it!

10:56.197 --> 10:58.324
Just a moment!

10:58.533 --> 11:00.819
If you insist on having your showdown,

11:01.036 --> 11:03.448
you will have to go through me first!

12:03.515 --> 12:05.301
F-Father!

12:46.599 --> 12:49.341
U-Understood.

12:49.561 --> 12:51.347
Do as you please.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.473
I'm sorry, Kaioshin-sama.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.449
The split is beginning!

13:10.665 --> 13:12.781
In your face, you miserable Kaioshin!

13:13.001 --> 13:17.415
It is only a matter of time now
before Majin Boo is revived.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.877
As you wish, I will change your location.

13:22.093 --> 13:24.300
Papparapa!!

13:27.182 --> 13:29.673
H-Huh? Th-They vanished.

13:29.893 --> 13:33.806
Just where could they have
disappeared to, Mister Satan?

13:35.607 --> 13:41.978
D-Damn! l was just about to
teach them a painful lesson, too! Tsk!

13:42.197 --> 13:46.736
Um, Mister Satan? What shall we
do about the awards ceremony?

13:46.951 --> 13:48.862
Hmm, for Pete's sake.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.069
The spectators all ran away
over this commotion,

13:51.289 --> 13:52.825
and there's no TV coverage.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.282
There's not much point in holding one,
under the circumstances.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.868
Well then, let's leave it at "See you next time."

13:58.087 --> 13:59.588
Mm-hmm.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.919
Also, there's the matter of the runner-up.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.636
The runner-up?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.426
You know, Contestant No. 18,

14:07.639 --> 14:10.881
who went one-on-one against you
at the end, Mister Satan.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.682
N-No. 18?!

14:22.111 --> 14:26.150
Y-Yes, indeed! Well, she may not
have been a match for me,

14:26.366 --> 14:28.903
but she truly did do quite well!

14:29.118 --> 14:34.329
Mm-hmm, she was really something else!
Outstanding, outstanding!

14:42.507 --> 14:45.340
For cryin' out loud, Vegeta!

14:45.552 --> 14:49.966
After messin' up the arena this bad,
where did he go off to?

14:50.181 --> 14:54.220
You don't suppose Goten-chan is
buried under the rubble, do you?

15:01.234 --> 15:04.647
Vegeta, what happened to you?

15:10.451 --> 15:13.284
I wonder what this Majin guy is like.
Do you think he's strong?

15:13.496 --> 15:16.488
You don't think our papas have
already beaten him, do you?

15:16.708 --> 15:18.323
Huh? Oh, no!

15:18.543 --> 15:21.910
I'm just saying, my papa, your old man,

15:22.130 --> 15:26.043
and Gohan-san are there.
They'll wipe out whoever is there.

15:26.259 --> 15:30.593
No! No! That's no fun!
I want to see this Majin Boo guy!

15:30.805 --> 15:34.138
All right, then, let's fly even faster, Goten!

15:34.350 --> 15:35.851
Uh-huh!

15:45.945 --> 15:48.277
You shouldn't have any
problem with this place.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.319
No.

15:49.532 --> 15:50.738
You can't, Father!

15:50.950 --> 15:53.657
Never mind them.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.532
At this point, there is nothing else we can do.

15:56.748 --> 16:00.161
You two go ahead and fight
without reservation.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.539
Myself and Son Gohan-san will
smash through this entrance,

16:03.755 --> 16:06.747
and go fight Babidi and Dabra.

16:06.966 --> 16:11.710
We probably cannot help shocking
Majin Boo into coming out now.

16:11.929 --> 16:12.634
Given the options,

16:12.847 --> 16:14.758
it is preferable that we get Majin Boo this way,

16:14.974 --> 16:18.592
before he absorbs your damage energy
and reaches his full power.

16:20.563 --> 16:25.182
If we are lucky, we may be able
to stop his revival altogether.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.733
What did you say?

16:27.945 --> 16:29.856
Like I'd ever let you do that!

16:30.073 --> 16:34.316
Vegeta! Make them stop! Kill the meddlers!

16:34.535 --> 16:36.241
Kill them!

16:41.084 --> 16:46.169
Vegeta, kill the meddlers! Kill them!

16:56.432 --> 16:58.343
Babidi's magic!

17:00.937 --> 17:04.179
Do it, Vegeta! Kill them!

17:10.780 --> 17:13.396
Go on, do it! Do it!

17:20.790 --> 17:21.905
|-| refuse!

17:22.125 --> 17:23.455
What?!

17:23.667 --> 17:26.284
Whatever Kaioshin and Gohan do,

17:26.503 --> 17:28.870
it has no bearing on my fight!

17:29.090 --> 17:34.585
|-|'m going to say this just one more time!
Take care of Kaioshin!

17:39.142 --> 17:41.508
Go on, Vegeta!

17:42.520 --> 17:48.732
I already told you!
| just want to fight Kakarrot!

17:48.943 --> 17:53.528
|-| am the proud Saiyan prince!

17:53.740 --> 17:57.028
I am not about to become
one of your subjects!

17:57.243 --> 17:59.950
You may hold sway over
my mind and my body,

18:00.163 --> 18:09.333
but you will not get your way with my pride!

18:19.474 --> 18:24.844
Th-This has never happened before.
How full of pride this one is!

18:25.062 --> 18:29.476
Hmm, it does not matter, does it, Babidi-sama?

18:29.692 --> 18:34.527
Regardless, his task is to steal
energy for us, after all.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.071
As long as I remain here,
once Kaioshin arrives,

18:37.283 --> 18:39.365
he will be unable to do anything.

18:39.577 --> 18:42.364
Besides, this is what you wanted, is it not?

18:42.580 --> 18:46.072
To see Kaioshin die right before your eyes?

18:46.292 --> 18:48.328
U-Unbelievable!

18:48.544 --> 18:52.662
To think there's a person who can
defy Babidi while under his control!

18:52.882 --> 18:57.797
This is how badly you wanted to
settle the score with me, Vegeta?

18:59.889 --> 19:02.676
In fact, would it not be better
to have us open the door,

19:02.892 --> 19:06.009
and allow Kaioshin to come to us?

19:06.229 --> 19:09.721
It would not be as fun if
he forces his way through,

19:09.941 --> 19:13.525
and shakes up the ship, reviving Majin Boo

19:13.736 --> 19:15.397
before he attains his perfect power.

19:15.613 --> 19:19.902
Indeed. You're right. Very well.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.568
He opened it on his own!

19:23.788 --> 19:26.780
It does not serve him to have
his spaceship destroyed, after all.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.955
Okay, Father, we're heading in.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.329
Mm-hmm. Go get 'em.

19:31.546 --> 19:34.959
Oh, hold on, Gohan! There are
still two more senzu beans.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.711
The ones left over from
what you gave your girlfriend.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.383
Take one before you go.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.678
You used up a bunch of your
strength back there, right?

19:45.184 --> 19:46.720
Th-Thanks.

19:48.062 --> 19:52.271
Get mad, Gohan. Get mad
and recall your fight with Cell,

19:52.483 --> 19:55.395
and draw out all the power you have.

19:55.611 --> 19:56.396
Get mad?

19:56.612 --> 20:01.231
Do that, and there ain't no one in
the whole world that can beat you.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.781
There ain't no one.

20:02.994 --> 20:07.112
Right. But Father... it's a shame
that your one and only

20:07.331 --> 20:10.994
precious day back ended up
turning out this way.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.827
Okay, we're off!

20:18.509 --> 20:20.124
Sorry to keep you waiting.

20:20.344 --> 20:25.304
I've been waiting, Kakarrot!
I've been waiting for this moment...

20:25.516 --> 20:27.802
...for so very long!

20:31.731 --> 20:33.562
I don't want the damage I take from you

20:33.774 --> 20:36.026
to end up as energy for Majin Boo.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.648
I'm gonna give you my highest power,
so we can end this quickly.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.149
I can't wait.

20:41.365 --> 20:45.278
Let me see the results of your
training in the Next World.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.367
Impressive, all right.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.041
Your power is even greater
than Gohan's was back then.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.888
I ain't as sure this is gonna end so soon now.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.722
Let's go! I'll kill you, Kakarrot!

21:15.942 --> 21:20.060
Goku's resolve dismisses even Kaioshin.

21:20.279 --> 21:25.444
Vegeta's pride brushes aside Babidi's orders.

21:25.660 --> 21:29.323
Goku versus Vegeta--
the greatest showdown in history,

21:29.538 --> 21:33.747
beyond anyone's power to stop, now begins!

22:41.944 --> 22:43.400
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:43.612 --> 22:46.479
Vegeta, I'm going to settle this right now!

22:46.699 --> 22:51.033
Gohan, Kaioshin-sama, get to where
Babidi is, one way or another!

22:52.621 --> 22:56.159
The revival of Majin Boo
is just a matter of time now.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.990
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:58.210 --> 23:02.249
"Countdown to Revival--Dash Babidi's Dreams!"

23:02.465 --> 23:05.332
Father, please let me handle it from here.
