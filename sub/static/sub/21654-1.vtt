03:55.268 --> 03:57.669
- Gogo, what was he
doing with this house?

03:57.671 --> 03:59.972
- Oh, this a ghost house.

03:59.974 --> 04:02.674
Thai people, they give
present to the ghost,

04:02.676 --> 04:03.775
make them happy.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.811
Happy ghost stay in here,

04:05.813 --> 04:08.013
and then they not
go in your home.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.948
So good idea, keep ghost happy.

04:09.950 --> 04:10.916
- Yeah?

04:10.918 --> 04:11.850
Gotta keep those ghosts happy.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.386
- No, no, no, it's okay, I do.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.988
Oh hey, you have a guide?

04:15.990 --> 04:17.456

04:27.934 --> 04:28.834
Ya got it?

04:28.836 --> 04:29.735
- Mm hmm.

04:29.737 --> 04:29.735
- Oh, sorry, excuse me.

04:29.737 --> 04:34.806
- It's no problem.

04:38.012 --> 04:40.746
Well, the windows won't open.

04:41.748 --> 04:44.049
Ah, this is worse than
a New York summer.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.420
- You wanna turn back?

04:48.422 --> 04:50.889
- No way, we did it.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.557
- Yes we did.

04:54.027 --> 04:57.296
- Hey, no, no, no,
I'm sticky, I'm gross.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.830
- And kind of beautiful

04:58.832 --> 05:00.832
and super sexy.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.893
- I love this.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.562
- Yeah, is that a, uh...

06:03.564 --> 06:04.596
- I want that.

06:04.598 --> 06:05.864
- Like a blessing stick?

06:05.866 --> 06:07.499
- No.

06:07.501 --> 06:10.535
- Jules, what about
this blessing stick?

06:10.537 --> 06:12.637
How much you think
i can talk her down?

06:12.639 --> 06:13.605
- Seriously?

06:13.607 --> 06:15.574
Jim, that's disresp, come on.

06:15.576 --> 06:16.908
Come on, Jesus.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.911
- They put the dick
in the fish's mouth.

06:19.913 --> 06:23.448
- You know Bangkok, in
thai we call krung thep

06:23.450 --> 06:26.151
and krung thep
mean city of angel,

06:26.153 --> 06:27.953
and you come all
the way to Thailand

06:27.955 --> 06:30.422
and you've come to
Los Angeles again.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.958
Oh, look at that, it a fat man.

06:32.960 --> 06:33.859
He so fat.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.462
People in Thailand
also eat McDonald,

06:37.464 --> 06:40.098
and if you eat a lot,
sometime you get fat

06:40.100 --> 06:43.402
just like America,
so we the same.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.404
- Gogo, can you please
stop here please?

06:45.406 --> 06:48.006
- Oh, okay, okay, okay.

06:48.008 --> 06:48.006
- Where ya goin'?

06:48.008 --> 06:50.142
- I'm just gonna
get a closer look.

06:50.144 --> 06:51.510
One sec, okay?

07:50.571 --> 07:51.503
Let go!

07:52.706 --> 07:54.573
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

08:09.522 --> 08:11.490
I can't read any of this.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.759
- Neither can I.

08:15.928 --> 08:16.728
- Oh man.

08:28.007 --> 08:28.006
Jim.

08:28.008 --> 08:32.711
- I love you, Julie,
for better or for worse.

08:36.048 --> 08:38.082
Julie Marie Richardson,

08:39.118 --> 08:40.652
will you be my wife?

08:40.654 --> 08:44.188
- Yes.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.626
- Here, try it on.

08:48.961 --> 08:50.295
- Oh my god.

08:50.297 --> 08:51.263
- Does it fit?

08:51.265 --> 08:53.031
- It is so beautiful, it's--

08:53.033 --> 08:53.765
- you like it?

08:53.767 --> 08:54.733
- Yes.

09:04.545 --> 09:05.744
Oh, thank you.

09:05.746 --> 09:06.811
- Thank you.

09:06.813 --> 09:12.117
- Oh, tomorrow morning I give
special tour for you, huh?

09:12.119 --> 09:13.318
- Yeah, yeah sure.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.086
- Thanks, gogo.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.054
- Oh,

09:17.089 --> 09:18.256
my card.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.224
- Ahh.

09:23.329 --> 09:25.697
Look how he spelled brake.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.606
- It's a very nice hotel.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.809
You two new to Bangkok?

09:37.811 --> 09:40.045
- Yeah, just arrived
this morning.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.580
- I'm sorry, I'm Robert.

09:41.582 --> 09:42.280
- Ah, Jim.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.648
- And this is bill.

09:43.650 --> 09:44.583
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.284
- That's a fancy ring.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.719
- Oh, thank you.

09:47.721 --> 09:50.288
Jim just gave it to
me, we are engaged.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.190
- Oh wow, congratulations.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.059
Do you wanna join
us for a drink?

09:54.061 --> 09:55.093
We'd be honored,
wouldn't we bill?

09:55.095 --> 09:55.093
- Yeah, it'd be great.

09:55.095 --> 09:59.097
- We would love to.
- Yeah, you know, we just...

09:59.099 --> 10:00.098
- We insist.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.666
You two should be toasted.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.635
Besides, you know, we've
been around a while,

10:03.637 --> 10:05.203
I'm sure we can
help, places to go,

10:05.205 --> 10:07.205
things to do, and so on.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.607
- We would love to.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.108
- Yeah, maybe in a little while.

10:10.110 --> 10:10.108
- Brilliant.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.612
Well, we were just about to
go and grab a bite to eat,

10:13.614 --> 10:15.647
so, why don't you
give us a bell.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.349
Room 124, whenever you're ready.

10:17.351 --> 10:18.683
- Lookin' forward to it.

10:18.685 --> 10:20.752
- See ya later.

10:28.762 --> 10:31.296
- You're mine forever.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.169
- Oh yeah.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.238
- So anyway, basically what
he was just sayin' earlier,

10:40.240 --> 10:42.374
any price here, you half it.

10:42.376 --> 10:44.409
That's the rule of thumb.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.079
- Yeah, that's a
really nice one.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.215
Your missus has got
some talent, Jim.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.816
- In more ways than one.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.318
- Mm, cheeky.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.686
- You're not even looking.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.187
Maybe if you read
up on the culture,

10:56.189 --> 10:57.322
you'd see what I see.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.090
- Hey, I've read up.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.892
In fact, do you know why

11:00.894 --> 11:02.794
you don't wanna
piss off the ghosts?

11:02.796 --> 11:03.928
- The ghosts?

11:05.164 --> 11:06.665
- Yeah, Julie loves
those ghost houses

11:06.667 --> 11:07.732
they have everywhere.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.401
She's freakin' obsessed.

11:12.406 --> 11:14.272
- I'm listening.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.175
- Apparently if the ghost
doesn't find a house,

11:17.177 --> 11:19.811
it might just take up
residence in the living.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.780
- Jesus, that'll
put a fright up ya.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.348
- No, no, seriously, seriously,

11:23.350 --> 11:24.783
that's the myth.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.785
- You read that in a guidebook?

11:26.787 --> 11:30.955
- Well gogo told me while
you were takin' pictures.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.891
- Right.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.126
I say we move to somewhere
a bit more lively.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.195
What do you reckon?

11:37.197 --> 11:38.163
- Let's go.

11:53.946 --> 11:57.382
- Oh.

12:13.365 --> 12:14.866
What's up with that?

12:14.868 --> 12:17.869
- Bad luck to drop coins
on the floor here, mate.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.738
Apparently the locals reckon

12:19.740 --> 12:21.740
you're gonna lose a finger.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.943
- Uh oh, you hear that, babe?

12:24.945 --> 12:27.445
Keep an eye on these
for me, all right?

12:27.447 --> 12:29.414
- Well, looks like
they're getting along.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.949
- Yeah, well, Robert's
a pretty nice guy

12:30.951 --> 12:32.751
when you get to know him.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.285
When's the big day?

12:34.287 --> 12:36.287
- Ah, we haven't set a date yet.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.288
- Okay.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.890
- It's all really new.
- Right.

12:38.892 --> 12:39.991
- Are you married?

12:39.993 --> 12:41.426
- Me, no, not me.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.296
I think I'm better off
being on my own sometimes.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.498
- What about Robert?

12:46.500 --> 12:47.932
- Yeah, he has a girl.

13:22.401 --> 13:23.968
- Guys.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.470
You guys are not going in here.

13:25.472 --> 13:29.407
- Darling, you have him
for the rest of your life.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.975
- Just five minutes.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.277
- Okay, yeah.

13:33.379 --> 13:34.145
- Be right back.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.318
- Are you not gonna go in?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.020
- Nah, I've seen
more than enough.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.955
I'll keep you company here.

13:43.957 --> 13:44.889
- Thanks.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.854
- To new friends.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.322
- To new friends.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.000
- As long as you've got
money in your wallet,

14:29.002 --> 14:30.301
it's happy days.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.471
- What'd she say?

14:33.473 --> 14:34.973
- She wants you to buy a bottle.

14:34.975 --> 14:39.143
Come on, you're not married
yet, one more drink.

14:40.012 --> 14:41.613
- He's a lucky man, your fellow.

14:41.615 --> 14:45.650
- Yeah, yeah he is.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.156
- What about you, do you
ever let your hair down?

14:52.158 --> 14:53.124
- What?

14:53.126 --> 14:54.425
- I mean, like, your hair,

14:54.427 --> 14:56.027
do you always wear
it up like that?

14:56.029 --> 14:57.595
- I mean, my neck gets sweaty

14:57.597 --> 14:59.998
but yes, I do let my
hair down.

15:00.000 --> 15:00.965
- Show me.

15:02.134 --> 15:03.635
Do you mind if I, let me,

15:03.637 --> 15:05.403
just one second.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.505
- Ah, it's probably messy.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.141
- It looks good, it
looks much better.

15:10.143 --> 15:13.177
- Thanks.

15:30.162 --> 15:31.996
- Nice evening, huh?

15:34.533 --> 15:35.934
- Where's Jim?

15:35.936 --> 15:38.069
- He's just coming,
he's in the toilet.

15:38.071 --> 15:38.970
You ready?

15:38.972 --> 15:40.405
- Yeah, where to?

15:40.407 --> 15:44.075
- Well, this isn't your
cup of tea, is it Julie?

15:44.077 --> 15:45.376
- No.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.645
- The good stuff
is in the country.

15:47.647 --> 15:50.181
You love those
ghost houses, right?

15:50.183 --> 15:52.550
I know somewhere where
the four of us can go

15:52.552 --> 15:54.085
where it would blow your mind.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.087
Come on, stand up, stand up.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.388
- Okay.

15:57.390 --> 16:00.491
- It is a wee bit of a
trek, but it's worth it.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.961
We actually discovered
it by accident,

16:02.963 --> 16:05.029
pulled up in the Van,
got out to take a piss,

16:05.031 --> 16:06.731
and there it is,
just starin' at us.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.399
- What was it?

16:08.401 --> 16:10.635
- Well you're gonna have
to wait and see, ain't ya?

16:10.637 --> 16:12.637
- Guys, come on,
we're just gonna

16:12.639 --> 16:14.205
drive to the country right now?

16:14.207 --> 16:17.508
- We have one time on
this planet, one time,

16:17.510 --> 16:19.410
and our clock is tickin'.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.546
Don't you wanna look
back at that and say,

16:21.548 --> 16:23.548
fuck me, I had an adventure.

16:23.550 --> 16:24.449
- Yeah.

16:24.451 --> 16:24.449
- Yeah?

16:24.451 --> 16:27.986
All right, seriously,
i promise you

16:27.988 --> 16:30.488
the most amazing photographs.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.225
Okay?

16:34.227 --> 16:35.526
- Okay, let's go!

16:35.528 --> 16:37.261
- Hey, where are we going?

16:37.263 --> 16:38.629
- Come on.
- Let's go, let's go,

16:38.631 --> 16:41.466
- let's go, let's go!
- - Okay.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.572
- Your chariot awaits.

16:47.574 --> 16:48.573
After you, squad.

16:48.575 --> 16:49.640
- Thank you.

16:54.713 --> 16:56.614
- I'm not sure about this, mate.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.716
She's a really nice girl.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.254
- You okay?

17:03.256 --> 17:07.090
- Yeah, I'm just gonna
rest my eyes for a second.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.066
Where we goin', hotel?

17:48.068 --> 17:49.233
- No, country.

17:50.602 --> 17:51.536
- Country.

17:56.075 --> 17:59.110
Julie, we barely
even know these guys.

17:59.112 --> 18:02.346
- About an hour ago you
guys were best friends.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.715
- Come on Jules, I need a bed.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.652
- You had your little
fun, I'm gonna have mine.

18:07.654 --> 18:11.656
- It's not gonna
be too far from here.

18:13.225 --> 18:14.125
- Jules--

18:14.127 --> 18:15.093
- stop it.

18:52.164 --> 18:53.898
This is so beautiful.

18:59.738 --> 19:01.873
- Yeah, I think
this is it, guys.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.809
If you two wait here,
we'll go and check it out.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.144
- We'll wait.

19:07.212 --> 19:08.679
- What?

19:08.681 --> 19:11.349
It's better than making out
with some slut in a club.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.817
- I didn't make out with anyone.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.286
- Well the lipstick stain on
your mouth says different.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.420
- What?

19:16.422 --> 19:17.655
They came at me.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.290
I was gone five minutes.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.758
- Yeah, long enough.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.828
- Long enough for you to
snuggle up next to Billy.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.830
You wanna tell me what
that was all about?

19:25.832 --> 19:27.899
- What are you talking about?

19:27.901 --> 19:30.168
- Come on, I saw you two
starin' at each other.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.770
You were havin'
some kinda moment,

19:32.772 --> 19:35.673
so what the hell was that?

19:35.675 --> 19:35.673
- Nothing.

19:35.675 --> 19:39.677
He's a gentleman, or at least
knows how to act like one.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.312
- A goddamn chimney sweeper,

19:41.314 --> 19:45.216
or whatever the fuck it
is they do over there.

19:45.218 --> 19:48.386
- No, don't project
your guilt on me.

19:54.626 --> 19:57.328
- Hurry up, we haven't got long.

20:00.899 --> 20:01.966
Have you got it?

20:01.968 --> 20:03.734
- I don't like this.

20:03.736 --> 20:04.468
- Hurry up.

20:04.470 --> 20:05.336
- Look.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.237
- Have you got it?

20:06.239 --> 20:07.972
Just give me it.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.874
- All this is on you.

20:17.849 --> 20:21.452
- You crossed a
line tonight, Jim.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.987
How am I supposed to trust--

20:22.989 --> 20:23.955
- baby.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.858
- How am I supposed
to marry you?

20:31.763 --> 20:33.464
You know what?

20:33.466 --> 20:34.765
- No, no--

20:34.767 --> 20:37.468
- you can go fuck
whoever you want.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.703
- Ju, Julie.

20:43.309 --> 20:47.845
- This is incredible,
what is this place?

20:47.847 --> 20:51.415
- It's basically a
ghost house graveyard.

20:52.517 --> 20:55.453
They're too scared
to destroy 'em.

20:56.722 --> 20:58.823
So when the townies
are done with them,

20:58.825 --> 21:01.492
the older ghost
houses end up here.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.863
I wonder if they
give the wee ghosties

21:05.865 --> 21:07.498
an eviction notice.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.935
- Just don't touch
anything, okay?

21:10.937 --> 21:13.404
- I'm just taking photos.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.473
- You're not scared
of ghosts, are you?

21:22.481 --> 21:24.548
Hey look, she's a
beauty, ain't she?

21:24.550 --> 21:26.984
- No, they're all beautiful.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.855
- Woah, check it out.

21:39.531 --> 21:42.366
Look, come and have a look here.

21:46.772 --> 21:48.372
You should take it.

21:49.374 --> 21:51.776
- No, that wouldn't be right.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.444
- A souvenir for your journey.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.912
It's just trash,

21:55.847 --> 21:56.814
rubbish,

21:58.016 --> 21:58.983
junk.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.989
No one's gonna miss it,
so you might as well.

22:08.093 --> 22:10.995
- Julie wait, what
are you doing?

22:20.106 --> 22:21.072
What, hey!

22:23.809 --> 22:24.942
- Is this a joke?

22:24.944 --> 22:26.444
This is my scarf.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.987
- What the fuck, man?

23:09.989 --> 23:12.423
What the fuck's goin' on?

23:19.998 --> 23:20.965
Julie!

23:31.943 --> 23:32.877
Julie?

23:35.580 --> 23:36.947
You okay?

23:36.949 --> 23:38.983
- I don't feel so good.

23:40.051 --> 23:41.986
- It's okay, it's okay.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.954
Let's get you the
hell outta here.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.923
Give me this.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.124
Come on,

23:47.126 --> 23:48.092
up.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.040
- Stop.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.642
- Yeah okay, yeah.

25:15.046 --> 25:16.013
You okay?

25:22.988 --> 25:24.722
- I am just so tired.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.791
- Okay, just...

25:33.532 --> 25:35.299
Shit, I have a signal.

25:40.672 --> 25:43.107
Gogo, fucking voicemail, man.

25:46.611 --> 25:49.680
Gogo, it's Jim, uh,
we got stranded.

27:06.057 --> 27:07.291
Look.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.892
- I hear voices.

27:11.731 --> 27:14.231
- Oh babe, you okay, you okay?

27:14.233 --> 27:16.667
Julie, Julie, it's me, it's me.

27:20.271 --> 27:21.905
Gogo, hello, hello?

27:23.108 --> 27:25.376
Gogo, gogo, can you hear me?

27:27.145 --> 27:29.246
I need you to come get us.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.348
Julie's not, I think she's sick.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.684
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

27:33.686 --> 27:34.652
It's okay.

27:39.858 --> 27:42.893
Hey, I think it's
him, I think it's him.

27:42.895 --> 27:43.794
Gogo, hey!

27:43.796 --> 27:45.829
Right here, right here.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.837
She was totally fine
and then, I don't know.

27:53.839 --> 27:54.805
Maybe it's malaria?

27:54.807 --> 27:56.807
Can it happen that quick?

27:56.809 --> 27:59.443
- Not good stay here, we go now.

28:02.881 --> 28:05.883
- Those fuckin'
brits poisoned her.

28:09.788 --> 28:10.888
I'm so sorry.

28:12.891 --> 28:14.191
Where are you going?

28:14.193 --> 28:16.226
- This village I come from.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.295
- We need a doctor
or a hospital.

28:18.297 --> 28:19.296
- Too far.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.365
This better, trust gogo.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.473
- Oh wait, wait up, wait up.

28:40.852 --> 28:43.253
Okay, what can I do to help?

28:48.727 --> 28:49.493
- Shhh.

28:49.495 --> 28:50.728
- What, what can I do?

28:50.730 --> 28:51.462
Hello, hi.

28:51.464 --> 28:53.263
- Shh, shh, shh, Jim.

28:53.265 --> 28:55.733
- What, why are you whispering?

28:55.735 --> 28:58.402
- The spirit, they listen.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.875
- How is this helping?

29:04.877 --> 29:05.809
Babe.

29:06.878 --> 29:09.313
- You have to let
them help, yeah?

29:09.315 --> 29:10.914
Give them space.

29:32.404 --> 29:36.006
- What was that,
what is she saying?

29:36.008 --> 29:36.974
What?

29:38.042 --> 29:38.909
What?

29:38.911 --> 29:39.910
What?

29:39.912 --> 29:40.477
What is it?

29:44.549 --> 29:45.516
- Watabe.

29:47.018 --> 29:49.787
- Watamiyoo, what the...

29:54.526 --> 29:56.293
What, where's he going?

29:56.295 --> 29:57.828
- Go for help.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.029
- Will someone please tell me

29:59.031 --> 30:01.298
what the hell's goin' on here?

30:03.302 --> 30:04.868
- Jim, come, come.

30:16.014 --> 30:18.415
- What was that old lady saying?

30:18.417 --> 30:21.351
- She not happy with gogo.

30:21.353 --> 30:22.286
- Why?

30:28.560 --> 30:32.930
- People in the country,
they have story they believe.

30:34.532 --> 30:37.334
Long time ago there
was a woman from Japan

30:37.336 --> 30:39.369
who married a thai man.

30:40.572 --> 30:44.341
She leave her home and her
family to go stay with him,

30:44.343 --> 30:47.411
even though it made
her so sad and lonely.

30:47.413 --> 30:49.580
It's because she love him.

30:52.884 --> 30:54.418
But then one day,

30:55.920 --> 30:59.623
the man have affair with
a young servant woman

30:59.625 --> 31:01.592
and the wife find out.

31:02.861 --> 31:06.330
And she so angry, she
set fire to the house,

31:07.065 --> 31:08.932
try to kill them all.

31:09.934 --> 31:12.035
The man and the
servant girl get out,

31:12.037 --> 31:13.537
but the wife not.

31:15.139 --> 31:16.073
She burn,

31:18.042 --> 31:19.009
she die.

31:23.415 --> 31:26.516
Now that she dead,
not a happy ghost.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.087
In thai we call her watabe.

31:32.624 --> 31:35.058
- What does that
have to do with us?

31:35.060 --> 31:36.560
- Watabe still angry.

31:36.562 --> 31:39.162
She don't like
pretty young woman.

31:39.164 --> 31:40.397
- She's dead.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.599
- Yes, but still dangerous.

31:45.069 --> 31:46.570
- You're serious.

31:49.040 --> 31:52.142
- Thai people don't
mess with watabe.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.645
You cannot take what is hers.

31:54.647 --> 31:58.348
They keep her home in
sukowit, where I pick you up.

31:58.350 --> 32:02.052
They say she look after
the old ghost houses,

32:02.054 --> 32:06.123
keep her busy so she leave
the young women alone.

32:07.592 --> 32:10.427
But if you disturb
the ghost house,

32:10.429 --> 32:12.663
then she will come for you.

32:13.665 --> 32:15.933
You cannot hide,

32:15.935 --> 32:20.103
and she will take your soul
to the ghost world forever.

32:30.548 --> 32:33.450
- What, I thought you said
you called for a doctor.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.086
- It's okay, this better, yeah?

32:37.388 --> 32:39.957
- What's he gonna do,
pray her fever away?

32:39.959 --> 32:42.125
- Jim, thai people believe

32:42.961 --> 32:45.562
sometimes ghost take over body.

32:45.564 --> 32:46.997
Monk will help.

32:46.999 --> 32:49.466
You have to let him try.

32:49.468 --> 32:50.968
- Fuck this, we're
gettin' outta here.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.235
- Jim, stop.
- We're gettin' outta here.

32:52.237 --> 32:53.570
- You have to let monk help her.

32:53.572 --> 32:54.671
- No, gogo.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.440
- You have to let him help!
- Stay.

32:56.442 --> 32:57.975
Excuse me.

32:57.977 --> 32:59.676
We need a hospital,

32:59.678 --> 33:01.578
a hospital, a doctor.

33:02.714 --> 33:03.680
- Jim.

33:05.984 --> 33:10.120
- This has gotta be yellow
fever or dengue or, or...

33:12.590 --> 33:14.725
What am I supposed to do?

33:19.530 --> 33:20.497
Yeah,

33:21.733 --> 33:22.699
dengue.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.149
- Jim, don't worry.

33:39.151 --> 33:41.084
Monk take care of her.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.453
They pray for her all night

33:43.455 --> 33:46.156
and give her amulet
for protection.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.592
She'll be okay, trust gogo.

36:53.911 --> 36:54.878
- Julie.

37:23.474 --> 37:24.441
Gogo.

37:30.782 --> 37:33.883
Thank you, I'm
sorry we have to go.

37:33.885 --> 37:36.453
I just need to get her to bed.

37:40.459 --> 37:41.958
That's a big family you got.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.294
- Big family, many, many auntie.

37:44.296 --> 37:45.428
- Uh, yeah.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.030
She doesn't look
very happy with you.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.865
Should I pay the monk?

37:48.867 --> 37:50.300
- Oh, no, no, no, it's okay.

37:50.302 --> 37:51.768
You don't have to.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.937
She say gogo should call first.

37:53.939 --> 37:57.474
Gogo never call.

39:08.112 --> 39:09.546
- Thanks, gogo.

39:11.115 --> 39:12.549
For everything.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.053
- You call me, yeah?

39:17.055 --> 39:18.021
Anytime.

39:18.956 --> 39:20.123
- It's a deal.

39:27.465 --> 39:29.899
- I had the strangest dream.

39:30.968 --> 39:33.937
And there was this
terrible woman,

39:35.039 --> 39:36.940
and she was so angry.

39:38.376 --> 39:42.045
Her face looked like it
had been burned in a fire,

39:42.047 --> 39:45.982
and she wanted inside me,
Jim, she wanted my soul.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.917
- I think we've all had a
little too much ghost stuff

39:47.919 --> 39:49.619
for one night, okay?

39:54.492 --> 39:55.658
Is that yours?

39:59.597 --> 40:02.165
They planned it all out.

40:02.167 --> 40:05.635
They were gonna leave
us the whole time.

40:10.641 --> 40:14.010
They didn't, they
didn't try to rob us.

40:14.979 --> 40:17.113
- I don't care, I don't care.

40:17.115 --> 40:20.016
- They were gonna try to rob us.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.184
- Jim,

40:29.427 --> 40:33.096
- I'm gonna have a little
talk with our English friends.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.464
- Think it through.

40:34.466 --> 40:38.635
Whatever reason they
had, they mean business.

40:39.503 --> 40:41.104
- Nah, I should call the cops.

40:41.106 --> 40:43.006
I'm gonna find out
where they're from

40:43.008 --> 40:44.174
and I'm gonna send
them the hospital bill

40:44.176 --> 40:45.675
as soon as we get
you checked out.

40:45.677 --> 40:47.076
- I don't want--

40:47.078 --> 40:48.611
- fucking assholes!
- A hospital.

40:48.613 --> 40:50.547
- You should at least
get checked out.

40:50.549 --> 40:52.482
- No, I just want this bed

40:52.484 --> 40:55.618
and I want you in
it with me, please.

40:56.487 --> 40:57.454
Please.

40:59.190 --> 41:00.156
- Okay.

41:12.703 --> 41:16.072
That was the scariest
night of my life.

41:18.242 --> 41:19.676
- I don't know.

41:22.613 --> 41:23.546
- What?

41:27.184 --> 41:29.152
- It's hard to explain.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.220
It was like,

41:30.222 --> 41:35.492
I knew you were there and
everything was gonna be okay.

41:36.994 --> 41:39.963
It was like it was
just beginning.

41:42.533 --> 41:45.034
- So where are we now?

41:45.036 --> 41:47.170
The beginning or the end?

42:01.285 --> 42:04.554
Are you sure about this, Jules?

42:04.556 --> 42:05.788
- Yeah.

43:06.183 --> 43:07.717
- Are you okay?

43:09.721 --> 43:10.687
What?

43:10.689 --> 43:12.589
Should I get a doctor?

43:12.591 --> 43:13.723
Are you okay?

43:13.725 --> 43:17.260
- No, I just
need an aspirin.

43:17.262 --> 43:18.227
- Okay.

43:19.263 --> 43:22.298
Sure, I'll, I'll
go to the pharmacy.

43:25.035 --> 43:27.704
Is there a pharmacy around here?

43:27.706 --> 43:30.373
- You will find
everything marked.

43:30.375 --> 43:32.275
- Okay great, thanks.

43:34.612 --> 43:38.047
You know I, I was supposed to
meet a couple friends of mine

43:38.049 --> 43:41.117
but I, I forgot
their room number.

43:41.119 --> 43:42.619
- What are their names?

43:42.621 --> 43:44.854
- Robert and Billy somethin'.

43:44.856 --> 43:46.856
Look, I don't know
their last names.

43:46.858 --> 43:49.859
They're English, two
guys stayin' together.

43:49.861 --> 43:52.128
- We have three British guests.

43:52.130 --> 43:53.796
They checked out this morning.

43:53.798 --> 43:54.764
- Three?

43:54.766 --> 43:56.633
No, two, it was two guys.

43:56.635 --> 43:58.868
- Two guys, and a one lady.

43:59.770 --> 44:01.137
- You sure?

44:01.139 --> 44:04.707
- Oh yes, they were stay
with us for a long time.

44:04.709 --> 44:06.409
- Okay great, thanks.

45:05.403 --> 45:06.369
- Jim?

47:29.980 --> 47:30.913
Hello?

47:58.876 --> 47:59.609
Hello?

48:05.315 --> 48:06.115
Hello?

48:09.553 --> 48:10.519
Jim?

48:21.031 --> 48:21.998
Hello?

48:48.425 --> 48:49.392
Anyone?

51:35.859 --> 51:37.226
- Julie!

51:37.228 --> 51:38.094
Julie.

51:38.096 --> 51:39.595
Move.

51:39.597 --> 51:40.329
Julie.

51:42.700 --> 51:44.333
Julie.

51:44.335 --> 51:46.702
It's me, it's me, it's Jim.

52:17.834 --> 52:19.668
- I'm sorry for the delay.

52:19.670 --> 52:22.338
We had to restrain
and sedate her.

52:25.276 --> 52:27.209
- Have you found out
what's wrong with her?

52:27.211 --> 52:28.711
- Yes and no.

52:28.713 --> 52:31.413
There's nothing wrong with
her, clinically speaking.

52:31.415 --> 52:32.815
You're okay.

52:32.817 --> 52:34.683
Listen, it's okay.

52:34.685 --> 52:37.887
Her condition, we've seen it
with folks in the country,

52:37.889 --> 52:41.157
but it's a battle to
even get them here.

52:43.661 --> 52:46.395
I had a patient with
a similar ailment

52:46.397 --> 52:48.697
just recovered this morning.

52:48.699 --> 52:50.799
Listen, it's okay, calm down.

52:50.801 --> 52:52.434
You'll be just fine.

52:57.408 --> 52:59.175
- Another American?

52:59.843 --> 53:01.944
- No, British, I believe.

53:03.180 --> 53:03.913
- British?

53:08.251 --> 53:10.686
Do you have any
idea where she went?

53:10.688 --> 53:13.255
It's very important
that I speak with her.

53:13.257 --> 53:15.925
- I imagine she's
on a plane by now.

53:15.927 --> 53:20.296
She and her two friends are
very anxious to get home.

53:21.398 --> 53:23.332
- Can I, can I see Julie?

53:23.334 --> 53:24.333
- Sure.

53:24.335 --> 53:25.201
- Thank you.

53:25.203 --> 53:25.968
- Mm hmm.

53:42.219 --> 53:43.752
- Gogo?

53:43.754 --> 53:46.322
I need you at the hospital.

53:46.324 --> 53:47.823
Yeah, right away.

54:12.716 --> 54:14.016
- Hey, where you go?

54:14.018 --> 54:15.851
- The airport.

54:34.771 --> 54:37.473
- It's okay, we
almost there now.

54:38.775 --> 54:40.809
Okay, I come and find you.

54:40.811 --> 54:42.811
- Wait here as long as you can.

54:42.813 --> 54:45.347
Whatever you do, don't leave.

55:45.475 --> 55:47.109
Fancy meetin' you here.

55:47.111 --> 55:48.110
- Hello, mate.

55:48.112 --> 55:49.978
Glad you got back all right.

55:49.980 --> 55:52.481
We found ourselves in a
bit of a rush, you see.

55:52.483 --> 55:53.949
No hard feelings.

55:53.951 --> 55:56.885
- Julie's in the hospital.
- Who is this?

55:56.887 --> 55:56.885
- I'm sorry about that.

55:56.887 --> 56:01.090
These tropical climates
are not to be trifled with.

56:01.092 --> 56:02.991
Never know what
you might pick up.

56:02.993 --> 56:04.860
- I don't know what you
did or how you did it,

56:04.862 --> 56:06.562
but I know it was you.

56:06.564 --> 56:08.564
- You're fucking
losin' it, mate.

56:08.566 --> 56:11.367
- You're gonna tell
me how to fix it.

56:11.369 --> 56:14.069
- What you want, an apology?

56:14.071 --> 56:15.504
Yeah, sure.

56:15.506 --> 56:16.472
I'm sorry.

56:36.826 --> 56:38.160
What's done is done.

56:38.162 --> 56:39.995
Get the fuckin' bags.

56:39.997 --> 56:41.830
- Wait, you know he's,
you know he's not,

56:41.832 --> 56:43.499
you know he's not gonna
do this willfully.

56:43.501 --> 56:44.633
It doesn't have to be over,

56:44.635 --> 56:46.635
it doesn't have
to be over, okay?

56:46.637 --> 56:49.505
Go to this address,
ask for Reno.

56:49.507 --> 56:51.173
Say that I sent you,
he will help you.

56:51.175 --> 56:53.442
If you're lucky, you've
got 36 hours at best.

56:53.444 --> 56:54.977
But don't waste any more time.

56:54.979 --> 56:57.112
Look, go, fucking go, go!

56:59.849 --> 57:00.916
- Gogo!

57:00.918 --> 57:02.117
Get in the car.

57:07.023 --> 57:08.924
You know this address?

58:14.724 --> 58:16.158
Sure we're in the right place?

58:16.160 --> 58:18.494
- Of course you are.

58:18.496 --> 58:19.495
Go and ask.

58:51.694 --> 58:53.128
- What you want?

58:54.063 --> 58:56.064
- I'm here to see Reno.

58:56.766 --> 58:58.767
Tell him Billy sent me.

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:14.336
- Reno?

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:15.771
- Who's askin'?

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:19.408
- I'm a friend of Billy's.

01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:23.412
- Oh, Billy.

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:28.216
- How is he, Billy?

01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:30.252
And his magnificent
friend, Robert?

01:01:30.254 --> 01:01:31.286
- They're fine.

01:01:31.288 --> 01:01:32.254
- Mm.

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:37.192
Who's this, your little toy boy?

01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:39.828
It wouldn't be an
exotic vacation

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:43.765
without a little
extracurricular activity, eh?

01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:51.907
- Gogo heard about you, Reno.

01:01:51.909 --> 01:01:53.775
Gogo heard you dead.

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:57.345
- Well the night
isn't over, is it?

01:01:57.347 --> 01:01:59.314
- My name's Jim.

01:01:59.316 --> 01:02:02.184
I'm here with my
girlfriend, Julie, she's,

01:02:02.186 --> 01:02:03.351
she's in the hospital.

01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:05.921
Billy said I should
ask for your help.

01:02:05.923 --> 01:02:08.890
- And what could I do
to help a man like you?

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:10.992
- Robert and Billy, they
did somethin' to her,

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:12.427
to Julie.

01:02:12.429 --> 01:02:14.963
The doctors don't know
what's wrong with her.

01:02:14.965 --> 01:02:16.865
Either she's,

01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:20.302
she's crazy or, she's
possessed by a ghost

01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:22.270
which is even crazier.

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:24.406
- Bye.

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:26.508
Bye.

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:29.211
Bye.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:38.487
Do you believe in the
spirit world, Jimmy?

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:42.891
- I didn't, but,

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.961
now I, I don't know.

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:49.831
- Of course you don't,
you're a man of the west.

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:51.533
You don't find ghosts
running up and down

01:02:51.535 --> 01:02:54.402
the aisles of the Walmart.

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:58.774
But here, the spirit world
is a whole nother matter.

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:01.376
- So can you help her?

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:05.480
- I don't know.

01:03:05.482 --> 01:03:08.216
I'm more of a sham
than a shaman,

01:03:08.218 --> 01:03:12.387
although I might've picked up
a few things here or there.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:16.525
- That's fine,
I'll try anything.

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:20.262
- Well, believe it or not,

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:24.800
your woman's been cursed.

01:03:24.802 --> 01:03:26.468
The only way you can help her

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:29.004
is a kind of sympathetic magic.

01:03:29.006 --> 01:03:31.473
You have to find another person

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:33.875
to transfer that spirit to.

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:38.880
Or otherwise, it
will eat her soul.

01:03:40.516 --> 01:03:42.284
- You want me to
do to someone else

01:03:42.286 --> 01:03:44.953
what they did to Julie?

01:03:47.825 --> 01:03:49.891
- You're an unlucky man.

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:53.295
You have a conscience.

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:55.497
Manny, Manny!

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:58.934
Get me another drink.

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:43.645
- Hello?

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:13.375
Leave me alone!

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:23.985
Leave me alone!

01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:16.104
- Julie!

01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:18.540
Julie, Julie, Julie, it's me.

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:19.507
Nurse!

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:23.478
It's okay, it's okay.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:26.247
Baby, the doctors
are here to help.

01:06:30.119 --> 01:06:31.586
- Oh god.

01:06:31.588 --> 01:06:32.554
Oh!

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:41.496
- Here you go.

01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:43.565
Nothing to worry, ma'am.

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:50.438
Okay with her?

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.007
She be fine.

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:58.013
- Help me.

01:06:58.015 --> 01:06:58.747
Help me.

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:00.782
- Okay, okay.

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:55.804
- Congrats, man.

01:07:55.806 --> 01:07:57.072
- Aww, thanks.

01:07:57.074 --> 01:07:58.206
- Now it's a party.

01:07:58.208 --> 01:07:59.741
- That's right, this
next one's on us.

01:07:59.743 --> 01:07:59.741
Waiter!

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:02.077
- You, you don't
have to do that.

01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:03.445
- Oh come on, if
you can't toast love

01:08:03.447 --> 01:08:05.313
what can you toast?

01:08:05.315 --> 01:08:08.183
- By the way, where
is the bride to be?

01:08:08.185 --> 01:08:09.784
- She's back at the hotel.

01:08:09.786 --> 01:08:13.788
She actually came down
with a little bug.

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:15.090
- Oh, bummer.

01:08:15.092 --> 01:08:16.291
Bad timing.

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:19.227
- Traveling is both
an art and science.

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:22.363
Sometimes you just gotta
roll with the punches.

01:08:22.365 --> 01:08:23.765
She'll be fine.

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:33.241
- To new friends.

01:08:33.243 --> 01:08:34.609
- Cheers, man.

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:35.609
- To love.

01:08:36.813 --> 01:08:39.781
- Oh oh, hey, hey,
party this way.

01:08:44.819 --> 01:08:45.787
- Woah.

01:08:46.721 --> 01:08:48.823
- I'm damn glad we met you, man.

01:08:48.825 --> 01:08:50.591
You're one of the good ones.

01:08:50.594 --> 01:08:53.261
- Don't worry, he says
that to all the guys.

01:08:53.263 --> 01:08:55.229
- No, seriously.

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:56.831
- I, um,

01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:02.804
I can't, I can't do this.

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.139
- Can't what?

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:06.407
- What, was it something I said?

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:07.642
- I gotta go.

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:09.310
No, no, I should
probably check on Julie.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:11.379
- What about
the ghost houses, man?

01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:13.680
- Cal, you're drunk, come on.

01:09:13.683 --> 01:09:17.352
You tell Julie that we
said she is a lucky girl.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:21.890
- Goodnight, captain.

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:30.765
- Hey, time to go.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:36.304
Shh.

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:39.701
Gogo!

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:41.703
Let's go.

01:10:41.705 --> 01:10:42.770
- Okay.

01:10:42.772 --> 01:10:44.372
You do not like hospital?

01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:46.374
- Those people
can't help us here.

01:10:46.376 --> 01:10:48.710
We gotta find another way.

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:02.790
- Hey, this a bad idea.

01:11:02.792 --> 01:11:03.758
- I know.

01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:54.809
- Oh Jesus, come on.

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:59.947
- There's another
way, there has to be.

01:11:59.949 --> 01:12:01.749
- Yeah well, it's
probably way beyond

01:12:01.751 --> 01:12:03.818
my limited abilities, man.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.321
You'd need a true believer.

01:12:06.323 --> 01:12:08.022
- Then take me to one.

01:12:09.024 --> 01:12:10.958
- It'll come at a great price.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.794
- I'll do anything.

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:16.331
- I believe you would.

01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:17.098
- Whoa,

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:19.100
easy.

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:24.839
- When did she desecrate
the ghost house?

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:24.839
- Desecrate?

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:27.475
She didn't desecrate
anything, they tricked her--

01:12:27.477 --> 01:12:28.409
- when?

01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:32.513
- Two days ago.

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:34.482
- Well then you
have exactly one day

01:12:34.484 --> 01:12:37.051
to free her from
that spirit's embrace

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:39.921
before she tumbles
into the abyss,

01:12:39.923 --> 01:12:43.358
'cause there ain't no comin'
back from that, Jimmy boy,

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.960
no matter how much you love her.

01:12:45.962 --> 01:12:47.895
Plain enough for you?

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:52.834
- Yeah, that's plain enough.

01:12:52.836 --> 01:12:53.968
Let's go.

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:54.936
Let's go!

01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:57.972
Let's go, Reno.

01:12:57.974 --> 01:12:58.906
Move, move!

01:12:58.908 --> 01:12:59.974
- All right.

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:13.087
- She's getting worse.

01:13:13.089 --> 01:13:14.522
Tell him where.

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:17.592
- Just drive.

01:13:37.479 --> 01:13:39.046
- Julie?

01:13:39.048 --> 01:13:41.416
- Where are you taking me?

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:46.087
- Well little lady, you
need to get some rest.

01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:47.955
You have a very
accomplished guide

01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:50.024
for today's little safari.

01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:52.193
- Don't talk to her, okay?

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.664
- Just put the gun down.

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:58.499
You look ridiculous.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:14.949
- What are you doing?

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.584
- Shoot me.

01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:19.454
- What?

01:14:19.456 --> 01:14:20.922
- Kill me.

01:14:20.924 --> 01:14:23.124
It's the only way
to keep me from her.

01:14:23.126 --> 01:14:24.058
- Julie.

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:24.959
- Do it!

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:25.927
- No!

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:28.162
No, baby, I'm...

01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:36.170
- Coward.

01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:58.993
- Julie.

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:00.528
What's happening,
what's happening?

01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:03.631
- Make sure she doesn't
swallow her tongue.

01:15:03.633 --> 01:15:04.699
What are these?

01:15:04.701 --> 01:15:05.633
What are they?

01:15:05.635 --> 01:15:07.668
- Which one's the tranquilizer?

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:08.669
- I don't read thai.

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:10.505
- Gogo, please, please.

01:15:12.575 --> 01:15:13.574
Hurry!

01:15:13.576 --> 01:15:14.709
- What is it?

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:20.281
- It's this one, it's this one.

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:26.220
- That's good,
that's good, do it.

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:41.168
You have no idea what
you're up against.

01:15:42.237 --> 01:15:43.204
- Oh no.

01:16:03.992 --> 01:16:04.792
- Jesus.

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:11.799
Were they all on, on one bike?

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:14.068
- That's nothin'.

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:17.104
I've seen six, seven
people on a bike.

01:16:17.106 --> 01:16:18.773
You ever seen that?

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:21.309
- No, I...

01:16:26.115 --> 01:16:27.348
- They're dead.

01:16:28.183 --> 01:16:30.251
Did you call the police?

01:16:35.624 --> 01:16:37.592
This could take hours.

01:17:36.718 --> 01:17:38.686
- What do we do?

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:40.921
- Gotta be another way,

01:17:40.923 --> 01:17:43.190
just gotta go back and find it.

01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:16.257
- Shit!

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:23.197
Julie!

01:18:26.902 --> 01:18:27.868
- There.

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:31.772
- Julie.

01:18:31.774 --> 01:18:33.774
What's happening, baby?

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:36.377
Julie, it's me, baby.

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:49.323
- She's almost gone.

01:18:49.325 --> 01:18:50.791
We have no time.

01:18:50.793 --> 01:18:52.793
Get her up, get her up!

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:25.459
Wait here.

01:19:31.399 --> 01:19:32.933
- Jim, trust him?

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:37.371
- We don't have a choice, go.

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:53.454
If we get through this,
things will be different,

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:54.855
I promise.

01:19:56.992 --> 01:19:58.993
- How touching.

01:19:58.995 --> 01:20:03.330
I don't think I'll ever have
to sweeten my coffee again.

01:20:03.832 --> 01:20:04.532
- What now?

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:09.937
Where are we going?

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:13.073
- The witch doctor.

01:20:13.075 --> 01:20:14.809
- The witch doctor?

01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:19.013
- Well what do you think we
had before modern medicine?

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:21.549
Magic.

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:25.019
Now get in.

01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:29.890
She knows we're comin.

01:20:51.514 --> 01:20:53.914
- Gogo, what's wrong?

01:20:56.918 --> 01:21:00.120
- The locals, they don't
even wanna come here

01:21:00.122 --> 01:21:02.089
because the waters are full of,

01:21:02.091 --> 01:21:06.427
, with demons.

01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:10.631
Get the motor started.

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:14.134
Tell him to start the motor.

01:21:25.146 --> 01:21:27.414
She's in their world now.

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:33.888
If we don't get her there soon,

01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:38.092
watabe will take her soul.

01:23:35.543 --> 01:23:38.245
The sun's about to rise.

01:23:38.247 --> 01:23:40.714
You're almost out of time.

01:23:40.716 --> 01:23:44.618
Whatever you find in
here, you gotta face it.

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:46.620
Be strong.

01:23:48.556 --> 01:23:50.524
- Just don't leave us.

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:46.613
What's she saying?

01:24:46.615 --> 01:24:50.250
- She say you cannot disturb
the ghost house of watabe.

01:24:50.252 --> 01:24:52.186
She say it's Julie fault.

01:24:52.188 --> 01:24:53.620
She cannot help her.

01:24:53.622 --> 01:24:55.689
- No, it, it was not her fault.

01:24:55.691 --> 01:24:57.658
She was tricked into it.

01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:59.226
Tell her she was
tricked into it.

01:25:01.197 --> 01:25:02.529
Please help her.

01:25:02.531 --> 01:25:04.565
I'll give you anything,

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.835
I just, I'm begging you.

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:13.707
- You beg me?

01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:15.309
- I do, I love her.

01:25:23.119 --> 01:25:26.320
- She say you must give up
something important to you,

01:25:26.322 --> 01:25:28.188
make ghost leave her.

01:26:23.878 --> 01:26:25.445
Not good enough.

01:26:25.447 --> 01:26:27.881
You must give a part of you.

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:33.720
Watabe need flesh and blood.

01:26:33.722 --> 01:26:34.688
Jim,

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:37.791
a finger.

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:43.197
- You want me to cut
off my fucking finger?

01:26:43.199 --> 01:26:44.698
I,

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:48.435
no, they, there's gotta
be something else.

01:26:48.437 --> 01:26:52.706
That ring stands for
everything between us.

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:53.674
Please.

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:56.376
Just try.

01:26:57.278 --> 01:26:58.812
We've come so far.

01:28:24.299 --> 01:28:25.065
Julie!

01:30:01.930 --> 01:30:03.997
- Get out, get to the circle!

01:30:03.999 --> 01:30:05.966
- I'm not leaving her.

01:30:09.103 --> 01:30:10.904
- No, no, leave her!

01:30:10.906 --> 01:30:12.906
The circle, it won't kill her.

01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:23.083
The ghost cannot hurt us here.

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:36.062
Wait.

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:46.006
Cut it off!

01:31:55.743 --> 01:31:56.710
- Jim?

01:31:58.246 --> 01:31:59.713
What's going on?

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:03.283
Are you okay?

01:32:26.707 --> 01:32:27.674
- Hey,

01:32:28.609 --> 01:32:29.776
you look good.

01:32:34.248 --> 01:32:36.016
How about a drink?

01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:40.253
- Who's that?

01:32:41.989 --> 01:32:43.757
- This is Reno.

01:32:50.031 --> 01:32:51.665
- Yeah, so what now?

01:32:51.667 --> 01:32:55.001
I mean, uh, you guys
aren't headin' back

01:32:55.003 --> 01:32:56.236
right away, are ya?

01:32:56.238 --> 01:32:58.171
I mean, you just got here.

01:32:58.173 --> 01:33:01.174
You guys haven't even
been to the beach, right?

01:33:01.176 --> 01:33:03.209
- Reno, shut up.

01:33:08.716 --> 01:33:10.283
- Gogo, thank you.

01:33:12.186 --> 01:33:14.054
You're a life saver.

01:33:14.056 --> 01:33:15.221
- You're welcome.

01:33:15.223 --> 01:33:18.224
Nah,

01:33:18.226 --> 01:33:19.659
- thanks, gogo.

01:33:20.828 --> 01:33:22.662
Thank you.
- Okay, it's okay.

01:33:22.664 --> 01:33:23.363
- You ready?

01:33:23.365 --> 01:33:25.765
- Come on, let's go.

01:33:25.767 --> 01:33:28.368
- Okay, see you next time, huh?

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:33.206
Hey, you have driver?

01:33:33.208 --> 01:33:34.708
Gogo best driver in Bangkok.

01:33:34.710 --> 01:33:36.176
No, it's okay, it's
okay, it's okay.

01:33:36.178 --> 01:33:38.745
Come, come, come, come,
come, this way, this way.

01:33:38.747 --> 01:33:40.246
Hey, you like Van?

01:33:40.248 --> 01:33:42.082
Cool music, new Van.

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:07.374
- Oh, can we get it?

01:34:07.376 --> 01:34:09.309
- Gwen, that thing's huge.

01:34:09.311 --> 01:34:10.810
Probably cost a fortune.

01:34:10.812 --> 01:34:12.879
- Oh come on, what's
a few dollars?

01:34:12.881 --> 01:34:14.748
It's totally authentic.

01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:16.883
- How would you know?

01:34:16.885 --> 01:34:19.786
- Something this crazy
looking, it's gotta be.

01:34:19.788 --> 01:34:21.688
Come on baby, please?
