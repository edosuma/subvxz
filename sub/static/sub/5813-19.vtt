WEBVTT

00:04.171 --> 00:05.969
We are not the only hunters
on the planet.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.933
Hunters. So trusting.

00:17.309 --> 00:20.028
Listen, I have seen
more than my share of monsters

00:20.479 --> 00:24.029
and I mean real monsters, bad monsters.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.784
Oh... Lucifer. Dear nephew.

00:28.946 --> 00:30.698
My, how you've changed.

00:48.215 --> 00:51.344
I think you and I need to have
a nice long chat.

00:59.977 --> 01:03.823
You may be the one thing in
all of creation that he still cares about.

01:04.022 --> 01:08.072
The one thing that could finally
make him show himself.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.674
It finally happened.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.963
What?
You didn't get detention this week?

01:25.002 --> 01:26.675
Me and Jackie, we kissed.

01:28.005 --> 01:31.350
Okay, can I stop hearing
about him every two minutes now?

01:31.925 --> 01:34.348
"You think he likes me?
Jackie looked at me."

01:35.178 --> 01:38.022
- "I think he looked at me."
- He definitely likes me.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.778
Jess, you know
you got to be careful, right?

01:41.852 --> 01:43.525
- I'm not an idiot.
- Yeah, I know.

01:43.729 --> 01:47.359
But it's not just Ned and Charlie
and those dicks who'll stomp your head in.

01:48.191 --> 01:52.196
I mean, everybody at school and in town,
they won't leave you alone.

01:52.529 --> 01:53.872
Okay.

01:54.865 --> 01:59.041
I wish we were gone already. Can't you lie
and say you're 18 and get a fake ID?

01:59.244 --> 02:02.214
California's expensive, okay?
We just gotta save some more money.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.750
You could sell your collection.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.877
I will, okay, when it's time.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.304
I can get at least 900
for the Buffalo nickel

02:09.545 --> 02:11.298
and another 400 for the double eagle.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.970
That's a lot.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.136
Look, Jess.

02:17.387 --> 02:21.437
As soon as I turn 18, I promise,
we're gonna get out of here, okay?

02:24.561 --> 02:26.484
- Can I see it?
- Yeah.

02:44.373 --> 02:45.420
Come on.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.220
Gotta go get that early morning bite,
all right?

02:50.420 --> 02:52.388
Hang on, I gotta pee.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.527
Matty?

03:08.355 --> 03:09.572
Matty.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.245
Jesse!

03:15.946 --> 03:18.790
Matty! Matty!

03:25.122 --> 03:28.422
Jesse!  Jesse! Jesse!

03:30.460 --> 03:34.636
Matty! Matty! Matty!

03:36.007 --> 03:37.475
Matty!

04:07.789 --> 04:10.793
Dude, you even move since last night?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.257
Sleeping is the new smoking.

04:13.462 --> 04:15.305
What? NO, it's not.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.308
It's sitting. Sitting is the new smoking.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.267
That can't be right.

04:20.635 --> 04:23.514
Dean, we'll find Cass, okay?
He's stronger than he looks.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.802
You know, we gambled with Cass
and now Amara has him.

04:25.891 --> 04:28.269
For a reason.
Which means he's still alive.

04:29.728 --> 04:30.820
I've been with Amara.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.900
Her beef is with the big guys,
with God, with Lucifer.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.699
The small fries, even an angel like Cass,
doesn't even register.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.998
And if it meant hurting Lucifer,
killing Cass would mean nothing to her.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.534
It's been a week.
We've still got no leads.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.744
- You think I don't know that?
- So...

04:47.078 --> 04:48.705
So we get back out there.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.588
We get back to work, we keep moving,
we keep working.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.717
We'll catch a break on Cass, we have to.
It's karma.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.917
You know, karma's been kicking us
in the teeth lately.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.221
Yeah.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.603
So, let's kick it back.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.855
Here, check this out.

05:07.098 --> 05:10.443
Libby Strauss.
Went missing near Gunnison, Colorado.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.113
Now, Libby's friend
claims she was carried off

05:13.313 --> 05:15.532
by a "mutant creature" with green eyes.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.431
- Demon?
- That's what I thought,

05:17.442 --> 05:19.115
but it gets better.
The friend chased after them,

05:19.319 --> 05:21.868
and she found Libby,
only it wasn't Libby anymore,

05:22.072 --> 05:24.621
because now she, too,
is a green-eyed mutant.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.202
Demon swap suits?

05:26.409 --> 05:27.626
Only one way to find out.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.247
How many missing do you have?

05:47.472 --> 05:51.568
Six, all in the last 48 hours.
They're disappearing, one by one.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.895
Okay, let's start with Libby Strauss.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.784
I understand that she was
from out of town.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.317
She and a friend
were visiting from Tucson.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.152
Uh, Libby was the first reported missing.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.680
But all the rest have been local?

06:01.903 --> 06:03.997
- All residents.
- You got any leads?

06:05.574 --> 06:09.295
The only eyewitness I have is the friend,
not the most reliable source.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.042
Why's that?

06:11.246 --> 06:14.546
She and Libby were on the last legs
of their cannabis tasting tour.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.339
Fumes still coming off the girl
when I questioned her.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.296
A tripping trip.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.766
Have you anything odd like this
happen around here before?

06:27.596 --> 06:29.269
Twenty-seven years ago,

06:30.599 --> 06:32.772
about a dozen residents went missing.

06:33.143 --> 06:35.942
Twenty-seven years before that,
another eight disappeared.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.152
All within the same timeframe?
Couple of days?

06:38.356 --> 06:39.528
Same time of year too.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.413
And how far back do the disappearances go?

06:41.610 --> 06:44.284
That's it.
Town's only been here since the '50s.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.660
It was all virgin forest
till they found coal here.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.545
So then how do people explain the missing?

06:48.700 --> 06:51.294
Mostly they don't.
People come and go in this town.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.168
I've only been here two years myself.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.925
There are some old-timers
with their theories.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.168
Such as?

06:58.710 --> 07:01.008
Town's built on an Indian burial ground.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.091
Forest folk are pissed
because we stole their coal.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.676
And what's your take?

07:05.967 --> 07:09.437
We're a small town. People get bored.
They get fed up, they leave.

07:10.138 --> 07:13.768
Once a few get free, it's like
a jail break, encourages the others.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.602
Every 27 years, like clockwork?

07:16.227 --> 07:19.447
Honestly, I... I'm just focused
on the missing that I have right now.

07:19.689 --> 07:23.068
You're welcome to take a look at
the files, talk to the witness.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.075
I've got panicked residents
I need to talk down.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.410
Gotcha.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.663
- What the hell's going on here?
- No idea.

07:34.996 --> 07:38.421
Whatever it is, it's moved in,
or keeps coming back for seconds.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.059
All right, I'll go check
the reports on the other missing.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.342
Oh.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.179
Guess that leaves me Ganja Girl.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.897
You're gonna say
I was hallucinating.

07:48.927 --> 07:51.021
The weed was laced with PCP or something.

07:52.889 --> 07:56.018
It's okay, Cori.
Just, just tell me what you remember.

07:56.226 --> 07:59.571
And nothing is too strange
or weird to mention.

08:01.898 --> 08:06.495
The thing that took Libby was naked.
And pale.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.993
Except for the eyes.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.042
I swear to God,
they flashed green for a second.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.423
And it didn't have any hair anywhere.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.385
It was shaped like a man.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.472
- Or was it a woman?
- Was it a man or a woman?

08:28.466 --> 08:29.843
It didn't have a...

08:31.011 --> 08:32.979
- A penis?
- It didn't have anything.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.772
What, you're saying it was junkless?

08:35.140 --> 08:36.357
Completely.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.106
Okay. Uh...

08:39.686 --> 08:43.111
Anything else unusual you can remember?
Sounds, smells?

08:43.565 --> 08:44.566
Definitely sound.

08:47.318 --> 08:51.368
When I found Libby,
she was just standing there.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.036
Shivering. Shaking.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.838
It was creepy.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.923
com; Libby?

09:10.258 --> 09:11.384
What happened?

09:16.056 --> 09:17.649
It wasn't Libby.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.902
I don't know what it was.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.318
The buzzing was coming from her body?

09:25.690 --> 09:28.694
We heard the same sound
right before that thing jumped out at us.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.121
Green eyes, buzzing.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.500
Weed alone doesn't conjure up
that kind of a scenario.

09:36.493 --> 09:37.915
Isn't that right, Sam?

09:38.787 --> 09:40.915
- Dude, I was 18.
- Sinner.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.838
It was college.
It was probably oregano anyways.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.294
- Rebel.
- You're an idiot.

09:45.502 --> 09:46.970
Look, I'm coming up empty.

09:47.170 --> 09:50.515
Also, nothing on Junkless
or the green-eyed shaker.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.407
So, we think Junkless turned Libby?

09:52.592 --> 09:56.313
Hold up, we're not actually gonna go with
"Junkless" on this, are we?

09:56.513 --> 09:57.513
Yeah.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.102
Dude, that's a new low even for us.

09:59.307 --> 10:02.277
Well, something happened.
Maybe the eyes, the buzzing.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.946
Yeah, no, you're right.
That can't be a coincidence.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.198
Uh, here, I found this.

10:07.482 --> 10:10.486
The, uh, the sheriff
who was here in '89, Cochran.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.866
Those are his notes.
There's no mention of buzzing.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.678
But he seemed to be closing in
on some of the missing and then

10:15.824 --> 10:18.703
his notes, they just kind of
abruptly stop.

10:18.993 --> 10:19.994
Did he take a flyer too?

10:20.370 --> 10:22.372
No, he remained sheriff
for a few more months.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.842
He ended up resigning
and then he fell off the radar.

10:26.751 --> 10:29.721
I asked around the station,
but that was a few sheriffs ago, so...

10:30.421 --> 10:31.422
Nothing?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.975
The dispatcher said
she thought he moved to Florida,

10:34.509 --> 10:37.012
- but that was a dead end.
- Kind of like this case.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.600
Hmm.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.516
Wait a second.

10:42.976 --> 10:47.527
Most of the witnesses in '89 and '62,
they're all dead or they've moved away,

10:47.730 --> 10:51.576
but there does seem to be one holdout
from the '89 case.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.403
Etta Fraser.

10:55.613 --> 10:56.739
Let's go talk to Etta.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.826
Your husband was one of the people
who disappeared in 1989.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.670
Oh, my second husband. Barely that.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.748
Pete only stuck around a couple months.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.125
So he left voluntarily?

11:07.417 --> 11:08.464
on...

11:08.668 --> 11:11.342
Pete was volunteering himself
all over the place.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.761
Right before he disappeared,

11:14.090 --> 11:17.435
people saw Pete diddling
two different women, in public.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.270
Separate occasions.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.473
You mean they actually saw him in the act?

11:23.057 --> 11:24.730
What does "diddling" mean to you?

11:26.436 --> 11:28.564
Pete was never a showman,

11:28.771 --> 11:33.402
but apparently,
Doris Kagen and Missy Petersen

11:33.735 --> 11:35.237
brought out the hog in him.

11:35.445 --> 11:40.246
Wait, Doris and Melissa, uh, Missy,
they disappeared that year, too.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.293
Oh, yeah. Surprise, surprise.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.666
I'd bet my mortgage
Pete ran off with one of them.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.422
But you reported him as missing.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.967
Well, he didn't come home for three days.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.889
I thought he was dead
in a ditch somewhere.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.805
We didn't find out about the women
for a long time after.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.011
Is that... Is that white sage?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.392
Hmm... Yeah, you know your herbs.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.776
You planning on taking a trip?

12:07.227 --> 12:10.948
Uh, yeah, I'm going to stay with my sister
a few weeks.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.195
For any reason?

12:15.693 --> 12:17.366
You're gonna think it's real out-there.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.244
Well, you'd be surprised
at the kind of crazy we hear.

12:21.449 --> 12:22.701
Well...

12:23.618 --> 12:25.416
When Pete went missing,

12:25.787 --> 12:27.107
and we found out about the women,

12:27.288 --> 12:29.382
my grandma said
that he "got the chitters."

12:30.124 --> 12:34.095
According to her, once a generation
around the Spring Equinox,

12:34.587 --> 12:36.589
people in town start going nuts.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.352
Having orgies. Copulating in the woods.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.723
And then they disappear,
never to be heard from again.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.588
Well, that's certainly one explanation
for Pete.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.822
I never really, um,
believed what she said,

12:53.314 --> 12:55.066
but now people are disappearing again.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.320
She always said,
"Burn sage to protect yourself."

12:59.362 --> 13:00.909
So why did she call it "the chitters"?

13:01.155 --> 13:05.285
Oh, that was the word Gran used to
describe the sound coming from the woods.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.042
When the orgies were happening.

13:08.246 --> 13:12.092
Kind of a buzzing and rattling.

13:13.001 --> 13:16.972
Did your gran ever mention
something about, uh, green eyes?

13:18.423 --> 13:19.640
Oh, yeah.

13:20.550 --> 13:23.019
Gran said that if you got the chitters,

13:23.344 --> 13:25.938
you get so revved up with lust,

13:26.514 --> 13:28.983
that your eyes would shine like emeralds.

13:34.105 --> 13:35.197
Oh.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.744
Ah.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.281
- So we got Spring Equinox.
- Which was yesterday.

13:43.489 --> 13:46.368
Orgies, buzzing green-eyed freaks.
Sounds like a rager.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.057
All right, let's pick up a six-pack.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.250
- Just six?
- Whatever. Let's hit the books.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.844
Just don't be a wuss,
it's faster this way.

13:57.045 --> 13:59.844
And it smells like a urinal, but whatevs.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.637
Whoa!

14:10.141 --> 14:11.142
Come on.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.838
We ran, and then another one
with green eyes came from nowhere.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.544
It was Coach Hollister.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.505
Grant Hollister?

14:36.793 --> 14:38.010
He attacked us.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.847
He had these teeth that were pointed.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.717
He ripped into Cliff.

14:44.926 --> 14:48.180
I could hear him screaming, but I ran.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.351
He killed Cliff.

14:55.645 --> 14:59.149
Did you, by chance, recognize the couple?

15:00.483 --> 15:02.531
It was one of the Deaver brothers.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.330
The tall one. And Mrs. Limoski.

15:05.696 --> 15:06.913
You're sure about this?

15:08.408 --> 15:09.785
Did you see anybody else?

15:11.661 --> 15:13.334
I couldn't see their faces,

15:13.871 --> 15:16.152
but I'm pretty sure there was
more of them down the alley.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.713
Past the couple.
I could see them moving around.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.971
The, uh, the couple that was going at it,

15:22.213 --> 15:25.308
would you say this was
an orgy-like situation?

15:27.051 --> 15:30.055
I've never seen an orgy.

15:30.388 --> 15:31.560
- No?
- Enough.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.626
Excuse us a second.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.404
I got a dead kid
minus a chunk out of his neck,

15:45.611 --> 15:47.739
and all the people that girl ID'd
are missing.

15:47.947 --> 15:48.948
Were missing.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.077
Yeah, now they're all having sex
with each other.

15:51.242 --> 15:52.243
Then there's that.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.791
Putting aside
the fact that Rob

15:55.037 --> 15:56.835
the fireman is screwing the librarian,

15:57.039 --> 15:58.757
and I am friends with his pregnant wife,

15:59.709 --> 16:02.462
now I've got two witnesses claiming
they saw, what?

16:02.753 --> 16:05.427
I don't even know. Aliens?
Attacking people.

16:05.923 --> 16:06.923
Yeah.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.093
What is this? Spanish fly gone bad?

16:09.594 --> 16:12.017
Well, I can honestly say,
this is a new one for us.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.023
I gotta go contact the families.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.185
Right.

16:18.603 --> 16:21.231
So, we have confirmed orgy-ish behavior.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.032
Yeah, just like Etta's husband.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.321
Of the chitters.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.445
I don't know,
we should go check the crime scene.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.072
Agent Lewis. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.075
Cori, calm down.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.206
Where exactly?

16:36.120 --> 16:37.167
All right, I'm on my way.

16:38.706 --> 16:39.946
Ganja Girl's pretty hysterical.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.588
Says she just saw her friend
walking in the woods.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.152
She's too freaked out to go, so...

16:43.211 --> 16:45.760
- You go, I'll grab the alley.
- Great.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.365
Libby?

17:17.494 --> 17:19.776
Hey, Libby, there's a whole lot of people
looking for you.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.739
- You hurt?
- No. I'm... I'm good. Thanks.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.912
Jesse, I think it's dead.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.323
Just making sure.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.580
Who the hell are you guys?

18:01.664 --> 18:03.086
You wouldn't believe us.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.931
So, how long have you guys been hunting?

18:19.432 --> 18:21.685
Together? About seven years.

18:22.852 --> 18:26.356
And we've heard of the Winchesters, but we
also heard you beat it a couple years ago.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.783
Uh... It's along, ugly, ugly story.

18:30.192 --> 18:33.366
- Hey.
- Sam, hey. Jesse and Cesar.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.927
- You guys are hunters, right?
- Yeah.

18:36.032 --> 18:39.036
- I'm surprised we never run into you.
- We're mostly in Mexico.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.038
- Sometimes we make a run over into Texas.
- Nice.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.798
Uh, nothing in the alley, by the way.
Thanks.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.343
You guys have any idea what we're hunting?

18:47.627 --> 18:50.801
They're called Bisaan.
It's a kind of cicada spirit.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.049
We couldn't find any lore on them.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.802
They're rare. At least in America.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.639
People think that they originated
in Malaysia, in the forests there.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.708
- So what are they doing here?
- What they always do.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.353
Every 27 years,
they come up from underground,

19:05.561 --> 19:09.532
they mate like crazy for a few days,
that generation dies off.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.659
And the whole cycle goes on repeat.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.156
So they're reproducing?

19:13.361 --> 19:15.659
Yeah, but we're dealing
with townsfolk here.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.223
I mean, they didn’t just crawl
out of a hole a few days ago.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.587
This is what surfaces.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.419
Bisaan can't reproduce on their own,

19:25.665 --> 19:28.168
so they take over a human body
to do the deed.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.511
They enter through the mouth,

19:30.711 --> 19:32.839
like a hermit crab climbing into a shell.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.425
Only they don't care
that the shell's not empty.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.012
- Well, that explains Junkless.
- What about the buzzing?

19:39.595 --> 19:41.848
It's how they communicate.
It's a mating call.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.100
And you, um...

19:44.767 --> 19:46.447
Kill them by taking off their heads,
I see.

19:46.894 --> 19:47.895
Seems to do the trick.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.027
How do you guys know so much
about these things?

19:53.609 --> 19:55.862
One of them took my brother 27 years ago.

20:01.575 --> 20:02.952
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.752
I've been waiting years to come back
and have this shot at them.

20:06.956 --> 20:10.631
So I hope you understand, I'm gonna ask
you two to take a step back from this one.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.260
Well, catch us up.
Where have you guys been?

20:15.589 --> 20:16.949
In the woods, where the action is.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.427
Looking for the burrow
and saving your ass.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.641
- What?
- Well...

20:24.890 --> 20:27.985
One of the reasons we've been
holed up in the trees is because

20:28.227 --> 20:30.901
Jesse hates the town and everyone in it.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.407
Because they're ignorant and useless.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.167
They didn't believe me 27 years ago,
they're not gonna start now.

20:36.277 --> 20:39.121
It's boneheaded
not to be following leads in town.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.041
Hey, nobody's stopping you
from talking to the whole box of crackers.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.749
You guys fight just like brothers.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.500
That's almost as bad as us.

20:49.498 --> 20:53.173
Well, it's more like
an old married couple.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.262
Oh...

21:00.134 --> 21:01.260
- Yeah.
- Okay.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.606
What's it like
settling down with a hunter?

21:06.098 --> 21:07.475
Smelly. Dirty.

21:08.184 --> 21:09.936
Twice the worrying about getting ganked.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.278
Jesse, you're from here.

21:14.857 --> 21:18.361
Do you know anything about the sheriff,
Cochran, who worked the case back in '89?

21:18.694 --> 21:20.788
That son of a bitch was incompetent.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.032
He shut himself away years ago.

21:23.449 --> 21:24.666
Do you know where he is?

21:25.951 --> 21:29.546
Turned tail. Ran off into the hills.
Couple towns over.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.967
- Lives like a hermit.
- Well, can you take us there?

21:33.667 --> 21:35.787
It seems like he was honing in
on some of the missing.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.838
- We need to find the burrow.
- Jess.

21:38.214 --> 21:40.512
We've been beating around the woods
for two days.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.559
That's where they are. You saw the tracks.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.475
I can keep searching on my own.

21:45.554 --> 21:46.646
We're losing.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.059
Why don't I go with you?

21:50.309 --> 21:52.152
Start where I got jumped.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.150
Okay.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.248
How long do we have
before these things are gone?

22:04.490 --> 22:06.333
We got to find the burrow tonight.

22:07.159 --> 22:10.538
By tomorrow,
the Bisaan will be underground, dying.

22:11.539 --> 22:14.008
Won't be able to find them or their eggs.

22:15.334 --> 22:18.508
And Jesse will wait another 27 years.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.679
Well, there's four of us now.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.182
We'll smoke those sons of bitches.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.560
Yeah. It'll eat him alive if we don't.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.443
It's hard to watch someone
go through that, isn't it?

22:32.852 --> 22:34.854
Yeah.

22:36.272 --> 22:39.025
I never had a brother. Or a sister.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.777
But I've seen it over and over.

22:41.944 --> 22:45.619
When someone lose someone
when they're young.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.792
It never heals over.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.703
No, it doesn't.

22:51.245 --> 22:52.792
And the insane thing is,

22:53.455 --> 22:56.800
how many hunters have you seen
over the years get their revenge?

22:58.043 --> 23:00.637
- A few.
- Yeah. Me, too.

23:02.381 --> 23:06.227
And they are never fixed, are they?

23:08.429 --> 23:09.976
No, I guess not.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.436
But you got to help him
get that revenge anyway.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.094
Yeah.

24:03.359 --> 24:08.035
I must have stumbled around
searching for Matty, 10, 20 minutes.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.164
I was shaking and panicking.

24:13.202 --> 24:15.330
Told myself I had to focus, find him.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.214
And I did.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.130
Those green eyes staring at me.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.548
It wasn't human.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.052
I took off. Didn't look back.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.726
You never saw him again after that?

24:31.887 --> 24:34.140
Everybody in town, including my mom,

24:35.391 --> 24:36.813
thought some pervert had taken him.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.354
She was falling apart, crying.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.732
"Why didn't I remember
what the guy looked like?"

24:43.482 --> 24:45.530
"Why was I making up this lie?"

24:46.235 --> 24:48.704
- She still live here?
- Moved as soon as she could.

24:49.071 --> 24:50.914
Still thinks I should've done something.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.997
Saved him. Everybody did.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.668
And they couldn't accept that your brother
was taken by a monster, huh?

24:58.080 --> 24:59.878
They couldn't accept a lot of things.

25:00.374 --> 25:01.591
But Matty did.

25:04.086 --> 25:05.588
He was a great brother.

25:49.173 --> 25:50.720
- You good?
- Go!

26:10.319 --> 26:12.242
I don't care
if you're FBI or not.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.540
It was 30 years ago.
I don't remember a damn thing.

26:16.867 --> 26:18.244
Except we never found them.

26:18.535 --> 26:21.505
Yeah, well, one of them was a 16-year-old
boy and that was my brother.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.499
Yeah, a lot of folks
lost family that year.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.755
And you didn't help
a damn one of them, did you?

26:26.335 --> 26:27.427
Jesse.

26:32.132 --> 26:33.133
Mr. Cochran.

26:34.468 --> 26:36.687
We're here because
more people have gone missing.

26:37.971 --> 26:39.314
The same MO.

26:45.854 --> 26:46.980
No.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.452
No, it's done.

26:55.489 --> 26:56.706
It's done.

27:04.414 --> 27:06.291
- Cesar.
- You lost it?

27:07.709 --> 27:09.962
No. No, I followed it.

27:10.587 --> 27:11.839
I saw where it went.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.217
I think I found the burrow.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.181
Thank God.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.228
I think that's why he attacked you.

27:18.428 --> 27:20.522
- He was being protective.
- Of what?

27:20.764 --> 27:22.186
The females. The burrow.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.977
Oh, that makes sense.
Must be laying their eggs by now.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.195
You gonna be all right?

27:27.396 --> 27:29.194
Yeah. Where are we headed?

27:29.439 --> 27:31.362
- It's a hike.
- That's okay.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.167
I tried to call Sam, there's no service.

27:33.610 --> 27:34.970
You think the whole brood's there?

27:35.154 --> 27:36.155
If we're lucky.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.998
- Let's go.
- All right.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.442
Okay, I'll tell you what,

28:14.526 --> 28:17.530
leave me your card and if anything
comes back to me, I'll call.

28:18.572 --> 28:20.245
Mr. Cochran, you don't own a phone.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.673
Look, we're not asking for a lot, just...

28:23.368 --> 28:24.870
Please tell us what you know.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.422
I couldn't find them.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.092
So, that's on me.

28:32.377 --> 28:35.381
I never recovered from it.

28:37.507 --> 28:39.976
So I bought this little slice of heaven
and made my peace.

28:41.094 --> 28:42.892
I wish you all better luck.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.523
Joe, please.

28:46.808 --> 28:49.311
I was 12 when my brother got taken.

28:54.942 --> 28:56.944
I never got over what I lost that day.

28:58.195 --> 29:00.744
One person in the whole world
I loved the most.

29:04.159 --> 29:07.379
Okay, I'm only gonna say this once.
It's time for you to go.

29:07.579 --> 29:10.549
Listen, we know what took Jesse's brother.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.714
And what took all the townspeople,
then and now.

29:14.795 --> 29:17.548
Now, Jesse was only a kid at the time,
but he was telling the truth.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.760
What took these people was not human.

29:21.301 --> 29:23.554
- How do you know?
- It's what we do.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.436
I saw one of the creatures today.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.871
I knew she was something.

29:42.698 --> 29:44.120
I didn't know what.

29:45.284 --> 29:50.290
I tracked one of those things down in '89.
It was sick and dying

29:52.040 --> 29:55.590
I followed it back to its... Its lair,
I guess.

29:59.172 --> 30:00.640
My daughter was there.

30:05.095 --> 30:08.895
Couple of days before that,
she had left to go back to school. I...

30:10.851 --> 30:12.353
I don't know what happened.

30:15.105 --> 30:16.732
But she was one of them.

30:18.567 --> 30:21.491
Wait a second.
You never reported her as missing.

30:26.533 --> 30:27.955
I knew where she was.

30:31.955 --> 30:36.301
All the missing people
were scattered all around, dead.

30:38.795 --> 30:41.469
I think she and that other thing
had killed them.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.301
I tried......

30:45.844 --> 30:48.222
I tried talking to her
but she attacked me,

30:48.430 --> 30:51.479
like some kind of rabid wolf.

30:53.143 --> 30:54.645
Teeth like thorns.

31:00.942 --> 31:02.239
I killed her.

31:04.321 --> 31:07.541
You son of a bitch.
You knew the whole time!

31:08.075 --> 31:10.419
You knew where they were
when everybody was suffering.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.166
I was suffering, too.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.873
Jesse, wait. Hold on, hold on.

31:14.081 --> 31:16.504
You think anybody would have believed me?
Monsters?

31:16.708 --> 31:18.881
You told me I was making it up.

31:20.420 --> 31:23.048
We could have told people together,
found those things.

31:23.256 --> 31:26.806
They were already dying.
And all the missing people were dead.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.011
No.

31:28.220 --> 31:31.724
You didn't wanna say
that your kid was one of them.

31:33.517 --> 31:37.488
- A monster. And that you killed her.
- Hey. Jesse.

31:38.021 --> 31:41.400
- You killed her.
- Jesse. Stop. Stop.

31:43.360 --> 31:47.240
What did you do?
Or did you just erase her from your life?

31:47.489 --> 31:49.207
Pretend that she just went away somewhere?

31:56.998 --> 31:58.716
Yeah, better to bury it.

31:59.459 --> 32:00.756
All of it.

32:02.504 --> 32:07.761
You just let the townspeople think
their loved ones had run off for a...

32:10.178 --> 32:11.350
Big, bright life.

32:11.555 --> 32:14.024
Where was she? Where did you find her?

32:15.058 --> 32:16.731
Over by Taylor Creek.

32:17.519 --> 32:19.112
The old Donnelly mine.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.032
Come on.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.790
I hate it when I lose my blade.

35:26.416 --> 35:29.090
Yeah, you could've jumped in anytime.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.273
What is this place?

35:46.519 --> 35:47.816
It's a maternity ward.

35:48.271 --> 35:49.864
Slash subway station.

35:50.315 --> 35:51.817
That hole.

35:52.275 --> 35:55.119
If that's a tunnel,
that's gotta go topside eventually.

35:56.529 --> 35:57.701
The mothers are already dead.

35:58.948 --> 36:01.576
The males weren't protecting them,
they were protecting the eggs.

36:01.910 --> 36:04.629
They must gestate inside for years
till they hatch.

36:05.538 --> 36:07.006
Yeah, well, these aren't.

36:08.958 --> 36:10.838
I got about five gallons of gasoline
in the car.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.382
I'll go pull her around.

36:33.149 --> 36:34.696
You guys find the burrow?

36:37.612 --> 36:39.372
- Where are they?
- They're in the mine.

36:39.406 --> 36:41.086
Don't worry,
they won't be coming back out.

36:41.783 --> 36:43.183
I just gotta take care of the eggs.

36:44.369 --> 36:46.087
- You okay?
- Hell, yeah.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.457
It's finally over.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.922
You wanna finish them off?

37:00.427 --> 37:02.100
Let's give him a minute.

37:07.350 --> 37:08.351
Ah, jeez.

37:11.104 --> 37:12.447
Hey, bro.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.701
I found Matty.

37:19.612 --> 37:20.613
Ah, jeez.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.039
Oh, God.

37:43.887 --> 37:45.889
We'll give him a proper burial.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.442
And what about the others?

37:52.937 --> 37:56.066
Don't worry, we'll, uh...
We'll take care of it.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.498
You know...

38:12.540 --> 38:14.580
Whenever you and Dad
used to leave me to go hunting,

38:14.584 --> 38:16.678
and I wouldn't hear
from y'all for a while,

38:17.629 --> 38:21.759
I was always sure that some vamp
or rugaru, or take your pick...

38:23.426 --> 38:25.929
I always figured
one of them finally got you.

38:27.764 --> 38:30.392
I tried to think of what to do, you know,
the next step to take.

38:31.768 --> 38:34.942
- I was just lost.
- We came back though, every time.

38:36.564 --> 38:37.781
Yeah.

38:38.274 --> 38:40.276
And look at Jesse,
I mean, he turned out all right.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.328
They're a good team.

38:42.654 --> 38:43.826
They are.

38:45.365 --> 38:46.662
I was thinking,

38:47.700 --> 38:49.418
maybe they could give us a hand.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.209
With Amara. With Cass.

38:53.623 --> 38:54.840
Fresh eyes.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.295
- Could use the extra muscle too.
- Yeah.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.019
You did it.

39:06.761 --> 39:09.435
We did it. Thank you.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.495
You know, it's a good thing
you guys had that fire extinguisher.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.453
Yeah, for a second there, I thought
the whole mine was gonna go up in flames.

39:31.661 --> 39:32.958
Yeah, you loved it.

39:33.162 --> 39:36.962
Like 27 birthdays and Christmases
all in one fireball.

39:38.084 --> 39:40.633
Well, you're awfully upbeat for a guy
who spent half the night in a cave.

39:40.837 --> 39:42.277
That's because we had a deal.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.766
When we finished this hunt,
if we got them,

39:45.008 --> 39:46.385
we hang up our spurs.

39:46.593 --> 39:47.719
Nice.

39:47.927 --> 39:49.804
Unless your hides need saving?

39:51.514 --> 39:52.561
No.

39:54.767 --> 39:56.189
No, we're all set.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.608
So, uh, what's freedom look like?

40:02.650 --> 40:04.323
A nice little spread in New Mexico.

40:04.527 --> 40:08.157
We've been paying on it for years,
set foot on it about twice.

40:08.489 --> 40:09.536
Gonna raise horses.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.957
And if that goes bust,
Jesse used to be an EMT.

40:13.453 --> 40:15.171
Oh, so now I'm supporting your ass?

40:17.373 --> 40:19.216
It's time to start living.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.103
Couldn't do it, huh?

40:31.721 --> 40:33.564
- No, it didn't feel right.
- Yeah.

40:34.557 --> 40:35.979
I know what you mean.

40:36.476 --> 40:38.570
Two hunters
who make it to the finish line?

40:40.271 --> 40:41.898
Yeah, you leave that alone.

41:35.284 --> 41:36.331
