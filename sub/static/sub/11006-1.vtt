01:10.680 --> 01:14.150
<i>I still hang around</i>

01:18.080 --> 01:21.755
<i>Neither lost nor found</i>

01:25.480 --> 01:29.189
<i>I hear the lonely sound</i>

01:32.280 --> 01:36.114
<i>Of music in the night</i>

01:36.160 --> 01:40.517
<i>Nights are always bright</i>

01:40.560 --> 01:43.199
<i>That's all</i>

01:43.240 --> 01:44.559
<i>That's left</i>

01:44.600 --> 01:48.149
<i>For me</i>

02:02.880 --> 02:05.348
<i>I play the street life</i>

02:05.400 --> 02:07.914
<i>Because there's no place I can go</i>

02:07.960 --> 02:09.518
<i>Street life</i>

02:09.560 --> 02:12.233
<i>It's the only life I know</i>

02:12.280 --> 02:14.032
<i>Street life</i>

02:14.080 --> 02:16.514
<i>And there's a thousand parts to play</i>

02:16.560 --> 02:18.152
<i>Street life</i>

02:18.200 --> 02:20.839
<i>Until you play your life away</i>

02:20.880 --> 02:22.791
<i>You let the people see</i>

02:22.840 --> 02:25.195
<i>Just who you wanna be</i>

02:25.240 --> 02:27.231
<i>And every night, you’ll shine</i>

02:27.280 --> 02:29.475
<i>Just like a superstar</i>

02:29.520 --> 02:31.636
<i>The type of life that's played</i>

02:31.680 --> 02:33.830
<i>A 10-cent masquerade</i>

02:33.880 --> 02:35.871
<i>You dress, you walk, you talk</i>

02:35.920 --> 02:38.195
<i>You're who you think you are</i>

02:38.240 --> 02:40.071
<i>Street life</i>

02:42.840 --> 02:44.637
<i>Street life</i>

02:47.160 --> 02:48.957
<i>Street life</i>

02:50.760 --> 02:53.228
<i>Oh, street life</i>

04:36.440 --> 04:38.396
This is a shithole, Murray.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.199
Well...

04:41.240 --> 04:43.196
just wanted to make you feel at home.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.559
I’m freezing to death out here.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.158
Look at you.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.474
Where did you get those clothes?

04:47.520 --> 04:48.919
I rolled a white guy.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.791
Now let me see the scag, man.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.239
Don’t try to talk like a nigger.

04:52.280 --> 04:53.554
You sound stupid.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.238
Will you just back off, anxious?

04:56.360 --> 04:57.429
First, a peek.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.918
Diamondback. Very pretty.

05:03.960 --> 05:05.188
It bites, too.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.798
Ooh.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.593
Ain’t we mean?

05:12.120 --> 05:15.032
You should get a grown -up gun
like mine, anxious.

05:15.080 --> 05:18.072
That is, if you can carry the weight.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.315
No, not over there. Move to your right...

05:20.360 --> 05:22.430
To your right a little bit.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.193
Now just look down and pull the plug.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.394
How many times can you step on it?

05:28.440 --> 05:30.237
Oh, you can hit this hard... 8 times.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.599
Bullshit.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.717
Don’t get nervous.

06:05.760 --> 06:06.795
Just somebody turning around.

06:06.840 --> 06:08.876
Damn sure better be.

06:09.880 --> 06:10.915
Come on, damn it!

06:10.960 --> 06:13.235
Goddamn it! The man’s just turning around.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.429
If that son of a bitch
comes all the way up that alley,

06:14.480 --> 06:15.833
I’m going to blow your goddamned brains out,

06:15.880 --> 06:16.915
because I ain’t going easy!

06:16.960 --> 06:17.995
I’ll handle it.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.754
Hey, Sharky, you all right?

06:20.800 --> 06:23.075
It’s me, Smiley!

06:38.560 --> 06:41.120
Aw, what a dumb son of a bitch.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.229
I’m all right.

06:42.280 --> 06:43.315
Nice going, asshole.

06:43.360 --> 06:44.998
Tell Jojo to block the alley.

07:07.320 --> 07:08.469
God damn it!

07:08.520 --> 07:10.238
Get him! Fan out! Fan out!

07:15.160 --> 07:16.718
No! No!

07:16.760 --> 07:17.795
You all right, Joe?

07:17.840 --> 07:19.319
- Yeah.
- Who is that guy?

07:19.360 --> 07:20.998
I don’t know. That animal must have a cannon!

07:21.200 --> 07:23.236
Let me go!

07:25.160 --> 07:26.593
What the fuck happened?
I didn’t signal Smiley.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.437
- You didn’t...
- Shut up, Jojo!

07:28.480 --> 07:29.879
Want a SWAT team, Lieutenant?

07:29.920 --> 07:31.512
Mitchell to Prior! Seal it off!

07:31.560 --> 07:32.629
28 to station 1.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.113
2 minutes! I want 2 minutes!

07:34.160 --> 07:35.639
2 minutes!

07:37.000 --> 07:38.035
Come on!

07:38.080 --> 07:39.354
Let me go!

07:39.400 --> 07:41.914
Open this goddamned door,
or I’ll blow her head off!

07:41.960 --> 07:42.995
Open it!

07:44.200 --> 07:45.235
Help me!

07:56.120 --> 07:58.680
Drive, or I’ll blow your goddamned brains out!

08:04.200 --> 08:05.428
- Somebody help me!
- Shut up!

08:05.480 --> 08:07.710
Please! Somebody help me!

08:07.760 --> 08:08.795
Hey, man, give us a break!

08:08.840 --> 08:09.989
Cut that shit out!

08:10.040 --> 08:12.838
Let go of me! Please let go of me!

08:12.880 --> 08:15.189
Get down, goddamn it!
Get down! Get down!

08:15.240 --> 08:16.753
Hey, brother, look, man...

08:16.800 --> 08:18.028
Hey, I’m cool.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.355
No!

08:23.120 --> 08:24.155
Hold your fire!

08:24.200 --> 08:25.235
Hold it. Hold it.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.798
No! Please! Please!

08:52.920 --> 08:54.114
Mister, don’t shoot!

08:54.160 --> 08:56.116
He’ll kill me and my baby! Please!

08:56.160 --> 08:57.229
Oh, God!

08:57.280 --> 08:59.350
Nobody’s dead yet!

08:59.400 --> 09:00.435
Let her down!

09:02.320 --> 09:03.355
Son of a...

09:03.400 --> 09:04.628
You ain’t going to shoot

09:04.680 --> 09:06.830
when I got this pregnant bitch in front of me!

09:06.880 --> 09:08.313
Now back off!

09:08.360 --> 09:10.715
Or all these chumps on this bus are dead!

09:18.640 --> 09:20.596
I’m shot! My God, I’m shot!

09:20.640 --> 09:22.596
I’m shot!

09:37.040 --> 09:38.075
Is that the junk man?

09:38.120 --> 09:39.348
Yeah.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.799
Is he dead?

09:42.120 --> 09:44.395
Why don’t you shake him
and see if he comes around?

09:44.600 --> 09:46.636
<i>So a civilian got shot</i>

09:46.680 --> 09:48.398
<i>That's no reason to transfer you,</i>

09:48.440 --> 09:49.714
<i>especially to that hole</i>

09:49.760 --> 09:51.193
<i>It's Smiley, that schmuck</i>

09:51.240 --> 09:52.275
<i>He came in from nowhere</i>

09:52.320 --> 09:53.355
<i>You want to know what I think?</i>

09:53.400 --> 09:54.435
<i>No</i>

09:54.480 --> 09:56.152
<i>I think it's shit, that's what I think</i>

09:56.200 --> 09:57.235
It’s a waste.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.475
You, busting hookers, perverts, and flashers?

09:59.520 --> 10:00.953
Jesus Christ.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.116
I mean, that’s really sick, Sharky.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.752
Thanks for trying to make me feel better, Joe.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.279
I mean, they got all losers down there.

10:06.320 --> 10:07.355
Thanks.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.515
You know what I mean.

10:08.560 --> 10:11.120
Listen, take your citations, for Christ’s sake.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.559
You earned them, you know?

10:12.600 --> 10:13.953
What the hell you taking that piece of shit for?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.911
Buy yourself a new lamp.
Why do you need that crap?

10:15.960 --> 10:18.713
Can I help you carry anything, huh?

10:18.760 --> 10:20.557
I don’t think you’re going to need the vest.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.272
The last casualty they had in Vice

10:22.320 --> 10:23.355
was a suicide.

10:24.480 --> 10:25.515
You know what I mean?

10:25.560 --> 10:27.278
I don’t understand you.
You take a stupid cup.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.914
You got citations up the kazoo, and you walk...

10:31.120 --> 10:32.155
Sharky, wait.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.997
Um, I’m really sorry.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.075
What can I do?

10:35.120 --> 10:36.314
Have a heart attack.

10:36.360 --> 10:37.873
Yeah.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.831
Have 2, Smiley.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.871
You bimbo.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.194
Asshole.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.878
You told him, Shark.

10:44.920 --> 10:45.955
You want to know what I think?

10:46.000 --> 10:47.035
No.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.672
I’ve been in this force for 12 years,

10:48.720 --> 10:50.995
and you are the best partner I’ve ever had.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.473
And that’s no shit.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.317
I mean, you’re a little crazy, you know?

10:54.360 --> 10:55.634
But I like you,

10:55.680 --> 10:57.910
and, uh, I’m never going to forget you.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.871
I’m never going to forget you, Jojo.

10:59.920 --> 11:00.955
Thanks, Shark.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.069
I appreciate that. I really do.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.838
I mean, 4½ years together, right?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.035
Shark.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.110
This is as far as I go.

11:10.160 --> 11:11.639
I mean, people go further,

11:11.680 --> 11:13.352
sometimes you never see them again,

11:13.400 --> 11:14.992
you know what I mean?

11:15.040 --> 11:16.075
Yeah.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.509
- See you around, Shark.
- See you around, Jojo.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.435
What a putz.

11:32.360 --> 11:33.793
I told you I’m looking.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.589
Hey! Sharky!

11:36.640 --> 11:38.756
<i>So I had an erection</i>

11:39.800 --> 11:41.631
<i>I always get erections when I'm there</i>

11:41.680 --> 11:43.079
<i>When I was a kid,</i>

11:43.120 --> 11:44.997
<i>I got erections when I was there</i>

11:45.040 --> 11:46.917
Oh, I know you love Jackie.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.359
Jackie won’t eat his dinner

11:48.400 --> 11:49.799
unless you feed him.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.435
<i>You know you can t go around</i>
<i>pulling your dick out in the park every Monday</i>

11:53.480 --> 11:54.595
<i>Monday's my day off</i>

11:54.640 --> 11:56.517
You gotta work on a hobby,
you know what I mean?

11:56.560 --> 11:58.437
<i>Well, uh, there's a tank full of fish at home,</i>

11:58.480 --> 12:00.357
<i>but that's not as exciting</i>

12:00.400 --> 12:02.834
He-e-ey.

12:03.880 --> 12:04.915
Sharky.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.109
Hello, Friscoe.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.390
Been a while. What 8, 9 years?

12:08.440 --> 12:09.555
9 years.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.319
Welcome to the snake pit.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.759
You know, Friscoe,

12:14.800 --> 12:17.075
we used to flush the toilets upstairs...

12:17.120 --> 12:19.873
always wondered where it came to.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.799
Still got that sense of humor.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.714
I hope it stays with you.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.876
That’s your place right over there.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.513
Right by the cage.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.433
Right.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.590
You can get it organized later.

12:49.160 --> 12:50.832
It’s been 6 weeks in a row.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.757
No, it could not have been 6 weeks in a row.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.518
Maybe 6 times, but not in a row.

12:54.560 --> 12:55.595
I’m telling you...

12:55.640 --> 12:56.914
Get rid of this clown, will you?

12:56.960 --> 12:58.359
I’m getting an earache listening to this shit.

12:58.400 --> 12:59.799
Hey, Ron! Upstairs. Book him.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.673
<i>Go on, Mr Mays, go on</i>

13:02.720 --> 13:05.109
You organized that real fast.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.999
I didn’t say that.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.075
You did.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.394
Excuse me. Excuse me.

13:10.440 --> 13:12.271
Papa, what, are you on a date?

13:12.320 --> 13:14.197
She’s a hooker! Book her or get rid of her!

13:14.240 --> 13:15.639
Ahh, Friscoe.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.079
For Christ’s sake.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.519
Here you go, darling.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.233
Something for the doggy.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.349
Sergeant.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.958
You had a good machine going upstairs

13:30.000 --> 13:31.399
till Smiley screwed it up.

13:31.440 --> 13:32.839
You cut off his head,

13:32.880 --> 13:34.199
he wouldn’t be any dumber.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.037
Down here, it’s different.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.469
Mostly misdemeanors. Hookers, panderers.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.750
What the hell you doing down here, Friscoe?

13:43.440 --> 13:45.078
How many years you got in?

13:45.120 --> 13:46.439
14.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.357
I got 18 in.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.469
2 more to go,

13:49.520 --> 13:51.158
so I don’t growl too loud anymore.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.714
What about Driscoll, Marindo?

13:53.760 --> 13:55.637
Arch is the best street cop in the house.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.830
He won’t take shit. That’s why he’s here.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.233
Papa, too.

13:59.280 --> 14:00.998
You know, he’s been shot 3 times.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.758
He doesn’t even remember where the scars are,

14:02.800 --> 14:04.313
but he’ll bare-hand a locomotive.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.679
They’re top men.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.392
They used to be.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.917
And I got news for you, Sharky.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.837
Upstairs, you had a big reputation

14:12.880 --> 14:14.279
for being a bad ass.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.719
You got your pusher, all right,

14:15.760 --> 14:17.398
but you got a civilian shot doing it.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.589
Down here, you don’t make waves.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.517
You’re right, this place is a cesspool,

14:20.560 --> 14:22.676
and if you make waves, I get a mouthful.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.951
Papa. Sharky.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.558
Hi. Arch!

14:29.600 --> 14:32.239
What’s on for tonight?

14:32.280 --> 14:34.475
Donald Hotchkins here
is running for governor,

14:34.520 --> 14:38.195
and he don’t want anybody peddling ass
while he’s making his speech in the square tonight.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.117
We gotta keep the city pure, right, Arch?

14:40.160 --> 14:41.195
Sure, Papa.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.275
Like missionaries.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.355
Arch!

14:45.760 --> 14:48.115
Oh, and we gotta make sure...

14:48.160 --> 14:50.355
the cab drivers wear their hats at all times.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.958
You’re shittin’ me.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.798
City law, Sergeant. No shit.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.751
Cab drivers gotta look nice.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.199
Pretty exciting work.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.639
You got the rank, Sergeant.

14:59.680 --> 15:00.874
You wanna skip it?

15:00.920 --> 15:02.672
Hey, that’s it! Let’s go eat.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.915
You like ribs? Jesus... aw, he don’t like ribs.

15:04.960 --> 15:05.995
There’s a place down here that...

15:06.040 --> 15:07.075
Come on! Move it!

15:07.120 --> 15:08.917
Show super cop what it’s all about.

15:08.960 --> 15:09.995
He’ll love it.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.075
Let’s eat Japanese.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.439
Arch, move it!

15:13.600 --> 15:16.273
I’m moving it, Lieutenant.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.311
Don’t have me tell you again!

18:11.080 --> 18:14.197
<i>Hello, my sweet blind angel</i>

18:25.360 --> 18:27.032
My friends, my friends,

18:27.080 --> 18:29.913
when you stand in that election booth on election day,

18:29.960 --> 18:33.270
and you mark that little “X”
in that little square next to my name,

18:33.320 --> 18:35.197
you are saying yes to good government!

18:35.240 --> 18:39.518
Yes! When you say yes to Donald Hotchkins,
you are saying yes to good government!

18:39.560 --> 18:40.959
Say yes! Say yes!

18:41.000 --> 18:42.877
Say yes! Say yes!

18:42.920 --> 18:44.638
Yes! Yes! Yes!

18:44.680 --> 18:46.238
Yes! Yes! Yes!

18:46.280 --> 18:47.679
Yes! Yes! Yes!

18:47.720 --> 18:49.119
Yes! Yes! Yes!

18:49.160 --> 18:50.195
Yes! Yes! Yes!

18:52.280 --> 18:55.352
<i>Unit 12 reports 2 victims in the shooting</i>

18:55.400 --> 19:00.155
<i>Female, oriental, 20, alleged prostitute,</i>
<i>and Detective Tad Roper, Central Intelligence</i>

19:00.200 --> 19:02.555
<i>All involved units switch to Tac 20</i>

19:02.600 --> 19:04.636
Scuttle was he was onto something.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.557
We’re baby-sitting a politician.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.273
<i>What you need is someone</i>
<i>who’ll give this city back to you!</i>

19:09.320 --> 19:10.878
Bullshit!

19:10.920 --> 19:12.797
Don’t let him get you down, Papa.

19:12.840 --> 19:16.150
I just wanna know who shellacs his friggin’ hair.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.918
<i>Yes, this city has problems</i>

19:17.960 --> 19:20.076
Ohh, shit.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.432
What the hell are we doing here?

19:26.600 --> 19:28.477
Hello, Sergeant.

19:28.520 --> 19:31.353
We’re here to arrest certain individuals

19:31.400 --> 19:35.916
that might be offering
to perform sexual acts for money.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.109
It’s what we do.

19:37.160 --> 19:39.515
Hey, Papa. I see Mabel’s working.

19:39.560 --> 19:40.629
Where?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.113
Right over there.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.912
Ahh. Mabel.

19:43.960 --> 19:44.995
See?

19:45.040 --> 19:46.632
The one in the tiger skin.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.033
Ohh, Mabel.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.798
Well...

19:58.000 --> 19:59.877
Well, go out there and get her, Sharky.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.037
She knows us.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.354
Go ahead.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.311
Oh, she’ll love you.

20:07.480 --> 20:08.993
You’re cute.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.319
50 bucks?

20:18.360 --> 20:20.237
Listen, I’m a trained professional.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.157
I demand a decent wage.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.269
Honey,

20:23.320 --> 20:26.153
I wouldn’t give you 50 bucks to do anything.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.195
I would.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.514
Hey, she’s yours.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.278
Sold...

20:31.320 --> 20:33.595
to the man with the smiling eyes.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.198
Sharky.

20:37.240 --> 20:38.275
Narcotics...

20:38.320 --> 20:39.719
uh... Vice.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.035
You fuckin’ low-life creep!

20:45.840 --> 20:47.398
What happened to the smiling eyes?

20:47.440 --> 20:48.759
May you go blind.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.678
And may your prick wither and fall off,
you Nazi bastard.

20:51.880 --> 20:54.075
<i>What's your first name?</i>

20:54.120 --> 20:55.235
Uh, Rachel.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.475
Rachel... what?

20:57.520 --> 20:59.397
Um, you just better go ahead

20:59.440 --> 21:00.589
and make it Ralph.

21:00.640 --> 21:01.675
Rachel Ralph?

21:01.720 --> 21:02.755
Just... just Ralph.

21:02.800 --> 21:03.835
Ralph.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.677
However, I’ll tell you something...

21:07.280 --> 21:08.759
Just give me your name, OK?

21:08.800 --> 21:09.994
Trixie Dumbaugh. Can you spell it?

21:10.040 --> 21:11.155
Trixie? As in tricks?

21:11.200 --> 21:14.033
<i>You want us on the corner</i>
<i>or in the unemployment line?</i>

21:14.080 --> 21:15.877
I’m new here, Mabel. This is my first night.

21:15.920 --> 21:16.989
Give me a break, huh?

21:17.040 --> 21:19.031
On the corner we cost the taxpayers nothing.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.036
Attitude! Lay it on him, baby!

21:21.080 --> 21:23.469
Lot a pleasure for a little bit of hard-earned coin.

21:23.520 --> 21:26.353
Jackson, wanna put the lady in the cage, please?

21:26.400 --> 21:28.118
Why?

21:28.160 --> 21:30.674
Why this political sexist persecution?

21:30.720 --> 21:31.948
Prosecution.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.274
<i>Why?</i>

21:33.320 --> 21:35.788
Get your hands off of her, shit-for-brains!

21:35.840 --> 21:37.239
Get your hands off her!

21:37.280 --> 21:39.840
Where’s he going? He’s going free, right?

21:39.880 --> 21:42.872
Why? Because he’s protected by the man!

21:42.920 --> 21:45.195
He’s the man’s favorite pimp!

21:46.000 --> 21:47.069
He’s safe,

21:47.120 --> 21:49.873
with his $1,000-a-night, thoroughbred imported...

21:51.280 --> 21:52.349
No. My God.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.879
He’ll kill me.

21:55.120 --> 21:56.917
Percy.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.837
Percy.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.757
I’m sorry.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.438
Hey!

22:02.480 --> 22:03.708
I didn’t mean it.

22:03.760 --> 22:05.159
I didn’t mean it.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.430
Oh, God, I swear I didn’t mean it.

22:07.480 --> 22:09.357
I didn’t mean it.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.072
I didn’t mean it.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.068
Who was that guy?

22:16.120 --> 22:17.997
Percy Sinclair. He’s a big-time pimp.

22:18.040 --> 22:19.917
If Mabel ever made $1,000 in one night,

22:19.960 --> 22:21.359
it’d break her back.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.435
You better know it.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.754
She said the man. What man?

22:23.800 --> 22:25.518
Sinclair left his money here.

22:25.560 --> 22:27.118
He left his address book, too.

22:27.160 --> 22:28.195
No, shit, Sherlock.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.992
- Got names in here.
- I copied them down.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.917
- You did what?
- I copied them down.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.757
- You copied them down?
- Yeah.

22:33.800 --> 22:34.835
For what?

22:34.880 --> 22:38.156
Listen, a $1,000-a-night hooker
never sees the inside of this place, you know?

22:38.200 --> 22:41.988
But I do happen to have here
in my trusty pocket, the list.

22:42.040 --> 22:43.075
Huh.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.031
- Sharky.
- Yeah.

22:45.080 --> 22:46.798
The lawyer’s gonna be down here in a minute.

22:46.840 --> 22:47.989
Something strange here. Look.

22:48.040 --> 22:50.429
- Every name is 7 letters.
- Yeah.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.549
Isn’t that weird?

22:51.600 --> 22:54.239
- Look at the money this guy’s got.
- Maybe not.

22:54.280 --> 22:55.918
What do you think that means?

22:55.960 --> 22:57.359
It’s not your money. What are you doing?

22:57.400 --> 22:58.833
Put it back in the bag.

22:58.880 --> 22:59.995
Jesus. Look at this.

23:00.040 --> 23:01.234
Uh, listen,

23:01.280 --> 23:03.191
if you don’t let me go pee, I’ll have to do it here.

23:03.240 --> 23:05.117
And this place looks like a shithole,

23:05.160 --> 23:07.515
so I guess it wouldn’t matter anyway, would it?

23:10.520 --> 23:11.839
<i>A’ is, uh</i>

23:11.880 --> 23:13.199
<i>You got 2, Sharky</i>

23:13.240 --> 23:14.275
<i>D’ is</i>

23:14.320 --> 23:15.355
<i>3?</i>

23:15.400 --> 23:17.277
OK, Sinclair is coming down the steps, so hurry up.

23:17.320 --> 23:18.719
“I” is what?

23:18.760 --> 23:20.318
“I” is a 4. What are you doing?

23:20.360 --> 23:22.476
Just bear with me. “A” is 2, right?

23:22.520 --> 23:24.795
I can’t believe this. This guy’s got $700.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.478
I got $11 in my pocket.

23:26.520 --> 23:27.555
“N” is...

23:27.600 --> 23:28.635
“N” is 6.

23:28.680 --> 23:29.829
6. And “A” is 2.

23:29.880 --> 23:30.915
Now what do you got? What is it?

23:30.960 --> 23:33.349
What we have here is phone numbers.

23:33.400 --> 23:34.435
Could be. So what?

23:34.480 --> 23:35.833
How’s it going?

23:35.880 --> 23:37.108
We got phone numbers.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.196
So this is not Sinclair’s.

23:39.240 --> 23:40.468
Lieutenant Friscoe,

23:40.520 --> 23:43.193
I would like to officially request...

23:43.240 --> 23:44.275
7.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.231
7 wire taps.

23:46.280 --> 23:47.554
Yeah, he ought to have 7.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.114
$700. I can’t believe it.

23:53.160 --> 23:54.673
<i>I got $11 in my pocket</i>

23:54.880 --> 23:56.313
Homicide wants to know where we got this one.

23:56.440 --> 23:57.839
How do you pronounce this one?

23:57.880 --> 23:58.915
Siakwan.

23:58.960 --> 24:01.758
Yeah, well, anyways, that Chink hooker
that got blown away with Tad Roper.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.119
Jesus. Somebody oughta call the cops.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.229
What’d you tell Homicide?

24:04.280 --> 24:05.508
I told them to eat shit.

24:05.560 --> 24:06.595
Yeah. Sure.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.359
The Department allowed all the taps on all but one.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.435
Yeah? Which one?

24:10.480 --> 24:11.754
This one. Number 2. Dominoe.

24:11.800 --> 24:13.756
- Why?
- It’s protected.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.199
Usually means another section’s on top of it.

24:15.240 --> 24:16.275
What section?

24:16.320 --> 24:17.992
Look, I don’t know! Jesus, you got 5 taps!

24:18.040 --> 24:19.439
You’ll be getting tapes tomorrow!

24:19.480 --> 24:20.708
Ineed 6.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.115
Sharky, we can’t get that one.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.195
I can get that one.

24:24.240 --> 24:25.275
Bullshit.

24:25.320 --> 24:26.469
How?

24:26.520 --> 24:28.556
This friend of mine. He’s buried in Personnel.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.999
He’s a top wire man.

24:30.040 --> 24:31.439
He’ll do it as a favor to me.

24:31.480 --> 24:32.515
Favor my ass, Sharky.

24:32.560 --> 24:33.834
Nobody does Vice any favors.

24:33.880 --> 24:35.950
I’m telling you, he’ll do it as a favor to me.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.433
Piss off, Sharky!

24:37.480 --> 24:39.835
You’re an ungrateful son of a bitch.

24:39.880 --> 24:41.279
Ey, ey, ey!

24:41.320 --> 24:42.992
This is my house.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.713
Don’t you talk to me that way.

24:45.760 --> 24:47.637
I’ll tear you apart right now, right here!

24:47.680 --> 24:49.557
I’ll kick the shit out of you!

24:50.680 --> 24:52.272
I’ll knock you to your knees!

24:52.320 --> 24:53.548
Hey...

24:55.360 --> 24:58.272
<i>I'm trying to put Lisa to bed,</i>
<i>so no more playing high school,</i>

24:58.320 --> 24:59.355
<i>OK, tough guys?</i>

24:59.400 --> 25:00.469
You see?

25:02.800 --> 25:04.995
You wanna kiss Daddy?

25:05.040 --> 25:06.109
Come on.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.151
Good night, Daddy.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.156
<i>Ohh What a big girl</i>

25:10.200 --> 25:11.713
Say good night to what’s-his-name there.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.875
Good night, Sharky.

25:13.840 --> 25:14.909
Good night, Lisa.

25:14.960 --> 25:17.155
What, from over there?

25:17.200 --> 25:18.553
What are you afraid of? Come here.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.192
<i>Come on She wants to kiss you</i>

25:20.240 --> 25:22.435
<i>Sharky, come over here</i>

25:23.520 --> 25:25.158
We hug in this family.

25:27.440 --> 25:28.668
Good night, Lisa.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.278
Good night, Sharky.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.675
You were talking when you were kissing.

25:32.720 --> 25:34.597
Give me another kiss.

25:36.560 --> 25:39.393
Would you believe
that she came out of something like me?

25:39.440 --> 25:41.795
No. I think you better check the mailman.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.717
You oughta have one of those, Sharky.

25:43.760 --> 25:45.079
You know, they keep you sane.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.155
Like you.

25:46.200 --> 25:48.031
Sure, like me. I got a family, a house.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.913
A nice little workshop here.
I make all the payments.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.439
And what do you do?

25:52.480 --> 25:54.550
You run around the street like a kid.

25:54.600 --> 25:55.794
I’m grown up now.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.717
What, I’m supposed to go and do that with you?

25:57.760 --> 25:58.909
Oh, no.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.359
Ohh.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.675
What do you want me to do?

26:02.880 --> 26:05.553
<i>Just a shirt, that's all I'm wearing</i>

26:06.720 --> 26:08.597
Oh, she sounds terrific. She must look good.

26:08.640 --> 26:10.551
Did you see her? No, you didn’t see her.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.591
I bet she looks terrific. Ohh, God.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.358
<i>My nipples are hard</i>

26:14.400 --> 26:16.277
Oh. Hard nipples. Ohh.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.719
<i>What color is the shirt?</i>

26:17.760 --> 26:19.637
What the hell difference does it make what color...

26:19.680 --> 26:20.715
Shh! God damn it.

26:20.760 --> 26:21.795
<i>Green</i>

26:21.840 --> 26:24.434
This is good stuff.
Oh, God, she’s driving me crazy.

26:24.480 --> 26:26.357
<i>I'm spreading it open</i>

26:26.400 --> 26:27.879
Spreading what open?

26:27.920 --> 26:29.797
<i>Would you touch yourself?</i>

26:29.840 --> 26:31.273
<i>Of course Where?</i>

26:31.320 --> 26:32.355
Ohh.

26:33.480 --> 26:34.993
Oh, you dumb son of a bitch.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.439
Ohh. Oh, oh.

26:36.480 --> 26:37.879
You got anything else?

26:37.920 --> 26:39.558
I got it. That’s the wrong tape.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.749
Uh, Shark, this is it.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.518
Listen to the voice on this.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.596
Ok, yeah. I love that girl’s voice.

26:44.640 --> 26:45.868
<i>Darling Sugar</i>

26:45.920 --> 26:46.955
Wait a minute.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.069
Listen to the guy’s voice.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.395
<i>I'm listening That's the girl's voice</i>

26:50.440 --> 26:51.873
All right, here it comes.

26:51.920 --> 26:53.638
<i>It's gonna look great on that body of yours</i>

26:53.680 --> 26:54.715
Anybody?

26:56.240 --> 26:58.117
<i>Just 2 arms, 2 legs, 2 tits</i>

26:58.160 --> 26:59.673
This is boring shit.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.312
<i>God, I love that body</i>

27:01.360 --> 27:02.918
<i>I don't recognize that voice</i>

27:02.960 --> 27:05.155
<i>After the election, it’ll be a different world for us</i>

27:05.200 --> 27:06.235
Hotchkins!

27:06.280 --> 27:07.599
<i>Da dum</i>

27:07.640 --> 27:09.039
Goddamn Hotchkins!

27:09.080 --> 27:10.593
Fucking candidate for governor Hotchkins.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.039
He’s got a wife and 5 kids,

27:12.080 --> 27:13.991
and we got him by the jewels, huh?

27:14.040 --> 27:15.712
We got headlines. That’s all we got.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.149
Right. Another politician screwing around.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.555
They see that on television every afternoon.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.238
I mean, not that I watch that shit.

27:22.280 --> 27:23.429
7 ladies.

27:23.480 --> 27:24.879
One’s got her hooks into Hotchkins,

27:24.920 --> 27:27.309
and that’s the one the Department won’t let us touch.

27:27.360 --> 27:28.759
Doesn’t that tell you anything, Friscoe?

27:28.800 --> 27:30.199
Aw, come on, Sharky.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.071
Jesus, you got wires into the Department?

27:32.120 --> 27:33.473
Come on, Sharky.

27:33.520 --> 27:35.715
Maybe it’s Hotchkins.

27:35.760 --> 27:36.875
Huh?

27:36.920 --> 27:38.114
Hotchkins.

27:39.160 --> 27:40.673
Well?

27:41.560 --> 27:43.278
What do you want now?

27:43.320 --> 27:45.197
I want to watch her round the clock.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.309
Who?

27:46.360 --> 27:48.316
What’s her name, Nosh?

27:48.360 --> 27:49.634
Uh, Dominoe, with an “E.”

27:49.680 --> 27:50.999
Dominoe.

27:52.320 --> 27:55.357
Do you know how many man -hours that would take?

27:55.400 --> 27:57.436
Just me. 24 hours.

27:57.480 --> 27:59.038
You.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.479
You?

28:00.520 --> 28:01.748
You!

28:01.800 --> 28:03.518
You see, that’s the trouble!

28:03.560 --> 28:05.755
Who else gives a damn?!

28:05.800 --> 28:07.836
Who else gives a... aw...

28:07.880 --> 28:09.916
Who else gives a damn?!

28:09.960 --> 28:11.916
<i>You see, we got a one-man show here</i>

28:11.960 --> 28:13.916
We gotta follow his routine.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.359
Huh? Change our routines.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.391
You know, dance to your tune.

28:17.440 --> 28:20.159
If I take this through the Department...

28:20.200 --> 28:21.599
No. You do that, and you blow it.

28:21.640 --> 28:23.517
- What?
- We blow it.

28:23.560 --> 28:24.913
We don’t wanna blow it.

28:24.960 --> 28:25.995
We?

28:26.040 --> 28:27.837
This is our case, Friscoe.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.711
Oh, no. No, no. It’s not my case.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.149
Don’t give it to anybody else, Friscoe.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.350
So who wires the place?

28:39.400 --> 28:40.913
He does.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.991
I didn’t hear that. What?

28:44.040 --> 28:45.234
He does.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.915
<i>Mmm mm mmm</i>

28:48.960 --> 28:50.871
Are you crazy?

28:50.920 --> 28:52.319
Are you...

28:52.360 --> 28:53.793
Are you dumb?

28:56.120 --> 28:57.917
<i>Now, you go through St Louis</i>

28:57.960 --> 28:59.837
<i>Joplin, Missouri</i>

28:59.880 --> 29:02.713
<i>Oklahoma City looks mighty pretty</i>

29:02.760 --> 29:04.159
<i>You’ll see</i>

29:04.200 --> 29:05.758
<i>Amarillo</i>

29:08.000 --> 29:09.433
Let’s see.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.357
- Hello there.
- Hello.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.914
We got one on the chair, the dresser,

29:13.960 --> 29:15.837
which will pick up the john,

29:15.880 --> 29:17.598
this one here.

29:17.640 --> 29:19.039
Give this a little test.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.957
Hello? Zebra 1 to Zebra 2.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.672
Zebra 1 to Zebra 2. Come in, Zebra 2.

29:22.720 --> 29:23.755
Come in.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.279
<i>Nosh, you wanna cut that zebra crap?</i>

29:25.320 --> 29:26.719
<i>I read you already Over</i>

29:26.760 --> 29:28.159
I think he reads you.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.077
Let’s check the ones in the other room.

29:30.120 --> 29:31.519
Wanna get your shoes, Sherlock?

29:31.560 --> 29:32.959
Thank you very much.

29:35.640 --> 29:36.709
<i>your kicks</i>

29:36.760 --> 29:37.795

29:37.840 --> 29:39.671

<i>Cha kop ta dum</i>

29:44.800 --> 29:46.756
<i>Sharky Papa She's walking in the building</i>

29:46.800 --> 29:47.869
She’s what?

29:47.920 --> 29:49.319
<i>She's walking in the building</i>

29:49.360 --> 29:52.716
What happened to she’s coming down the street,
she’s getting in the driveway?

29:52.760 --> 29:55.433
You know, you got
a big communication problem here.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.516
I didn’t hear one 10-4 in all that time!

29:57.560 --> 30:00.870
These guy’s don’t know diddly shit
about electronic communication!

30:00.920 --> 30:02.831
I’m not gonna do you any more favors.

30:02.880 --> 30:04.552
Damn you, Nosh. You take forever.

30:04.600 --> 30:05.999
You didn’t tell me we were...

30:06.040 --> 30:07.439
Jesus, she’s on her way up.

30:07.480 --> 30:08.515
Start working.

30:08.560 --> 30:09.834
What are we working on?

30:27.040 --> 30:29.508
<i>Tiffany, do you always have to leave the door open?</i>

30:29.560 --> 30:30.913
<i>Were you born in a barn?</i>

30:30.960 --> 30:33.235
- Who is that?
- Tiffany.

30:33.280 --> 30:35.271
<i>Close the door!</i>

30:35.320 --> 30:38.471
You know, we got some really good stuff
on the Tiffany tapes.

30:38.520 --> 30:39.555
Oh, yeah?

30:39.600 --> 30:40.794
Got a congressman.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.910
Can we kill the golden oldies, please?

30:42.960 --> 30:44.313
Look at her tits.

30:44.360 --> 30:45.429
Lungs.

30:45.480 --> 30:47.357
Tits. Lungs. No wonder we get a congressman.

30:47.400 --> 30:49.834
From the great state of mammary.

30:49.880 --> 30:51.359
<i>Not after last night</i>

30:51.400 --> 30:52.879
1,000 bucks a night.

30:52.920 --> 30:54.797
Is that right? Is that what they get?

30:54.840 --> 30:56.592
That’s right.

30:56.640 --> 30:58.039
I think that’s ridiculous.

30:58.080 --> 30:59.832
Inever paid for it in my life.

30:59.880 --> 31:03.190
Except that time when I was in the service in Japan.

31:03.240 --> 31:04.639
But I was lonely.

31:04.680 --> 31:05.749
Everybody was lonely over there.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.518
Been there for a long time.

31:07.560 --> 31:09.437
I don’t know what I paid, though.

31:09.480 --> 31:10.879
It was yen. Japanese money.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.797
Just pile it up and sleep on it.

31:12.840 --> 31:15.195
I either paid a buck 35...

31:15.240 --> 31:16.639
or $1,300.

31:16.680 --> 31:18.079
I still haven’t figured it out.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.997
<i>I have a plan</i>

31:20.040 --> 31:22.634
She was nice to me, though.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.079
<i>Hang on</i>

31:24.120 --> 31:25.712
This Tiffany. Know what I mean?

31:25.760 --> 31:27.193
She’s got a little meat on her.

31:27.240 --> 31:28.639
She’s a softy. Not like the other one.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.079
What’s her name? Dominoe.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.997
She’s too skinny. What do you think?

31:33.680 --> 31:35.352
I got it.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.311
You remember in the 10th grade

31:37.360 --> 31:40.033
there was this, uh, Rosalie D’Amato.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.149
Italian girl?

31:41.200 --> 31:43.077
She... she was built like this.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.997
Same kind of boobs.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.678
Rosalie D’Amato.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.119
Jeez, I loved her.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.036
Never screwed her, though.

31:53.680 --> 31:54.715
Did you?

31:54.760 --> 31:55.795
I mean...

31:55.840 --> 31:57.478
you can tell me now because, what the hell,

31:57.520 --> 31:58.839
a lot of time has gone by.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.359
What am I gonna do?

32:00.400 --> 32:03.392
You know, I’m not gonna get mad at you, hit you.

32:03.440 --> 32:04.509
Did you?

32:06.080 --> 32:07.115
Yeah.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.435
Oh, shit! Shit! Shit!

32:09.480 --> 32:11.436
I knew you did! I knew it!

32:11.480 --> 32:13.994
Jesus! You were always doing that!

32:14.040 --> 32:15.598
<i>We're getting out</i>

32:15.640 --> 32:18.473
<i>Uh, then how will we live?</i>

32:18.520 --> 32:21.512
<i>Well, we never settled on the dancing school</i>

32:22.560 --> 32:24.949
<i>Or the boutique or the farm</i>

32:25.000 --> 32:26.399
I’ll take the farm.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.078
Uh-uh. The boutique.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.475
You would take the boutique.

32:30.520 --> 32:31.839
Why me?

32:31.880 --> 32:34.269
Oh, Jewish guys never take the farm.

32:35.840 --> 32:36.955
What’s the matter,

32:37.000 --> 32:38.672
you didn’t see ‘Fiddler on the Roof’?

32:38.720 --> 32:39.755
Nothing but farmers.

32:39.800 --> 32:43.031
<i>I hate the thing he makes us do, too, but we gotta go</i>

32:43.080 --> 32:44.229
<i>I'm not up to it</i>

32:44.280 --> 32:45.429
<i>We have to</i>

32:45.480 --> 32:46.879
<i>Ohh</i>

32:46.920 --> 32:50.390
<i>Tiffany, move your ass</i>

32:50.440 --> 32:52.715
“Things he makes us do”?

32:52.760 --> 32:54.478
This could be something, huh?

32:54.520 --> 32:55.919
Yeah. I’ll take it.

32:55.960 --> 32:58.474
What, you’re gonna leave me here alone?

32:58.520 --> 32:59.589
That’s right.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.517
Well, that’s terrific. That’s terrific.

33:01.560 --> 33:05.189
I’ll be staring at space here
and listening to surface noise all night.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.718
<i>2, 3, and 4</i>

33:33.760 --> 33:35.557
<i>1, 2, 3, and 4</i>

33:35.600 --> 33:36.635
<i>Come on!</i>

33:36.680 --> 33:38.193
<i>Come on, girls!</i>

33:39.040 --> 33:40.189
<i>You're supposed to be ladies!</i>

33:40.240 --> 33:42.356
<i>Move! With elegance!</i>

33:42.400 --> 33:44.755
<i>And 34</i>

33:44.800 --> 33:46.199
<i>And 1</i>

33:46.240 --> 33:47.639
<i>That's good!</i>

33:47.680 --> 33:49.557
<i>Now go on!</i>

33:49.600 --> 33:51.318
<i>Let's see it go back!</i>

33:52.160 --> 33:53.388
<i>Ohh</i>

33:53.440 --> 33:54.839
<i>Right and left!</i>

33:54.880 --> 33:56.279
<i>Back! Get back!</i>

33:56.320 --> 33:58.356
<i>Back! All the way back!</i>

33:59.280 --> 34:00.599
<i>What, have you broken your neck, darling?</i>

34:00.640 --> 34:02.198
<i>Move your head back!</i>

34:03.280 --> 34:04.429
<i>3</i>

34:04.480 --> 34:06.198
<i>1, 2, 3</i>

34:06.240 --> 34:07.639
<i>Oh, Tiffany, you cow!</i>

34:07.680 --> 34:09.511
<i>That's it! Your other left!</i>

34:09.560 --> 34:10.675
<i>That's good!</i>

34:10.719 --> 34:12.915
<i>All right! Now have fun, girls!</i>

34:12.960 --> 34:14.359
<i>Have fun!</i>

34:14.400 --> 34:15.469
<i>Keep that elevation!</i>

34:15.520 --> 34:17.078
<i>Reach the ceiling!</i>

34:45.040 --> 34:46.598
Roll over.

36:35.280 --> 36:40.957
<i>Don't change your hair for me</i>

36:43.760 --> 36:45.318
<i>Not</i>

36:45.360 --> 36:49.592
<i>If you care for me</i>

36:51.680 --> 36:53.432
<i>Stay</i>

36:53.480 --> 36:56.119
<i>Little valentine</i>

36:57.280 --> 37:00.590
<i>Stay</i>

37:05.120 --> 37:07.634
<i>Each day</i>

37:07.680 --> 37:11.798
<i>Is Valentine s</i>

37:11.840 --> 37:18.188
<i>Day</i>

37:22.800 --> 37:23.994
Good night.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.028
You play much tennis?

37:44.080 --> 37:45.672
Nah.

37:45.720 --> 37:48.553
You gotta kinda isolate that little area.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.272
What little area?

37:50.320 --> 37:53.471
I mean, the tennis court becomes like...

37:53.520 --> 37:55.033
You read any Zen?

37:56.080 --> 37:57.479
No.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.715
It becomes your universe.

38:00.880 --> 38:03.155
And you become one with that space.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.555
One time, when I was, uh,

38:05.600 --> 38:06.919
riding in a cruiser,

38:06.960 --> 38:08.871
before I got into Vice...

38:08.920 --> 38:10.114
Yeah?

38:10.160 --> 38:13.789
I got a call that there was a domestic squabble.

38:15.120 --> 38:18.112
And I was by myself in the cruiser that day.

38:18.160 --> 38:20.037
Had no partner.

38:21.520 --> 38:24.830
So I went to this very, uh...

38:24.880 --> 38:27.235
depressed part of town.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.794
And I had to go around the back of this house

38:29.840 --> 38:31.558
and up these steps.

38:31.600 --> 38:32.999
I knocked on the door,

38:33.040 --> 38:34.917
and this lady opened the door...

38:34.960 --> 38:36.359
hysterical, crying, and was she bleeding.

38:36.400 --> 38:40.029
Well, I guess the guy had hit her
or smacked her or something.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.638
And so I stepped inside,

38:41.680 --> 38:44.513
and then this guy just stepped out of...

38:44.560 --> 38:45.959
shit, the closet or someplace.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.399
I didn’t see him.

38:48.520 --> 38:51.239
And he had a.357 in his hand.

38:51.280 --> 38:52.679
He was ranting and raving,

38:52.720 --> 38:54.597
and I thought he was gonna kill me.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.039
I thought, “God,

38:56.080 --> 38:58.116
I’m gonna buy it right here.”

39:00.240 --> 39:01.639
What’d you do?

39:01.680 --> 39:02.908
Well...

39:02.960 --> 39:05.155
I looked down the barrel of that gun,

39:05.200 --> 39:06.599
and I thought, “Oh, shit.”

39:06.640 --> 39:08.039
So I just...

39:08.080 --> 39:10.275
I had to cease to exist.

39:10.320 --> 39:11.878
Do you know what I mean?

39:11.920 --> 39:12.955
I wasn’t there.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.274
I pulled my antennae in,

39:14.320 --> 39:16.038
and I just, uh...

39:16.080 --> 39:17.877
minimized my force field.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.394
I disappeared.

39:21.440 --> 39:22.509
You disappeared?

39:22.560 --> 39:23.959
Yeah. I wasn’t there.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.399
I... I gave him nothing.

39:25.440 --> 39:26.839
He felt nothing from me.

39:26.880 --> 39:27.915
No hostility,

39:27.960 --> 39:29.234
no animosity...

39:29.280 --> 39:32.590
’Fraid that he could hear my heart beating, though...

39:32.640 --> 39:34.710
and walked into the other room.

39:34.760 --> 39:38.355
She was standing there, looking.

39:38.400 --> 39:40.277
I turned and walked towards the door,

39:40.320 --> 39:43.153
and she was still looking at the spot I was standing in.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.269
You were gone.

39:44.320 --> 39:46.038
Yeah, but, you see, I didn’t exist then.

39:46.080 --> 39:47.115
Right.

39:47.160 --> 39:49.390
So I said, “Ma’am,” and she was startled.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.317
She looked and she said, “Uh, yeah.”

39:51.360 --> 39:53.237
I said, “He’ll be all right.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.953
Go on. You know,
tell him you love him or something.”

39:56.000 --> 39:57.035
Yeah?

39:57.080 --> 39:58.354
I’ll never forget that.

39:58.400 --> 40:00.118
Me neither.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.350
What does Sharky think he’s going to miss?

40:04.400 --> 40:06.516
I mean, it’s all on tape, anyway.

40:06.560 --> 40:09.074
Well, he’s enjoying it, maybe.

40:09.920 --> 40:12.275
You like looking at broads?

40:12.320 --> 40:14.675
He could take 10 minutes to take a shower.

40:14.800 --> 40:16.518
What’s he gonna miss? I mean, she’s just...

40:16.560 --> 40:17.959
You want some chicken?

40:18.000 --> 40:19.399
...walking around.

40:19.440 --> 40:20.998
You know I don’t like chicken, Papa.

40:21.040 --> 40:22.439
Jesus. Man, you don’t like anything good.

40:22.480 --> 40:24.357
You don’t like chicken. You don’t like ribs.

40:24.400 --> 40:25.799
You don’t like hamburgers.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.398
You eat that Jap shit. That raw shit.

40:27.440 --> 40:28.475
It’s metaphysical.

40:28.520 --> 40:29.555
Metaphysical?

40:29.600 --> 40:30.635
Yeah.

40:30.680 --> 40:31.908
Raw fish is metaphysical?

40:31.960 --> 40:32.995
Sure.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.439
Fuckin’ worms in it?

40:34.480 --> 40:35.879
Comes from the earth.

40:35.920 --> 40:37.751
- It’s good for you.
- Know what it does for you?

40:37.800 --> 40:38.835
Got iodine.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.677
All right. What’d it do for them Japs?

40:40.720 --> 40:43.871
You ever see a Jap who was more than 4 feet tall?

40:43.920 --> 40:45.956
Yeah, but they’re very spiritual.

40:47.120 --> 40:49.315
You gonna tell me some more of that Zen shit?

40:49.360 --> 40:50.395
That’s right.

40:50.440 --> 40:54.115
You notice how they can go out
and live in a jungle off of just nothing?

40:54.160 --> 40:55.718
It’s all in the philosophy.

40:55.760 --> 40:58.433
It’s in their attitude about life.

40:58.480 --> 41:00.516
We eat too much in this country.

41:01.680 --> 41:02.715
No shit?

41:02.760 --> 41:04.193
That’s right.

41:04.240 --> 41:05.639
Besides,

41:05.680 --> 41:07.557
ribs will kill you.

41:07.600 --> 41:10.160
How the hell did I ever wind up with you?

41:10.200 --> 41:11.872
Jesus Christ.

41:11.920 --> 41:13.876
Hey.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.797
I appreciate you guys letting me take a shower.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.717
Well, we appreciate you taking a shower.

41:18.880 --> 41:20.074
You can leave now.

41:20.120 --> 41:22.350
Smelled like the bottom of a lion cage.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.439
Go ahead.

41:59.440 --> 42:00.668
<i>It's Don</i>

42:00.720 --> 42:02.119
That’s him, I think.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.991
It sure as hell is.

42:04.040 --> 42:05.792
<i>I had to be with you</i>

42:05.840 --> 42:07.717
<i>What about the security men?</i>

42:07.760 --> 42:08.829
<i>I’ll only stay 5 minutes</i>

42:08.880 --> 42:09.949
<i>OK 5 minutes</i>

42:10.000 --> 42:12.116
Hello, there, Don. Come on in.

42:12.160 --> 42:14.037
How come we don’t hear him any better?

42:14.080 --> 42:15.718
Let him get in the door.

42:15.760 --> 42:16.795
Jesus.

42:16.840 --> 42:18.432
God damn. That’s him.

42:18.480 --> 42:20.755
<i>It's gonna be a landslide! I can feel it</i>

42:20.800 --> 42:22.677
<i>Mmm! Does that mean I get to have my house?</i>

42:22.720 --> 42:24.676
<i>How much do we pay our governor, anyway?</i>

42:24.720 --> 42:27.439
<i>You're in that house, whether I win or not</i>

42:28.320 --> 42:30.390
I already bought it.

42:32.960 --> 42:33.995
What?

42:34.040 --> 42:35.598
I already bought it.

42:36.480 --> 42:37.595
You’re kidding me, aren’t you?

42:37.640 --> 42:38.675
Hmm?

42:38.720 --> 42:39.869
You’re kidding me, aren’t you?

42:39.920 --> 42:40.955
Cross my heart.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.831
- Hope to die?
- Hope to die.

42:43.960 --> 42:45.712
Promise me you’re telling me the truth.

42:45.760 --> 42:47.159
Did you really buy it?

42:47.200 --> 42:48.519
I got 4 minutes now. 3½.

42:48.560 --> 42:50.039
Would I lie to you about a thing like this?

42:50.080 --> 42:51.479
Sweetheart, I’m gonna be the governor.

42:51.520 --> 42:52.555
Would the governor lie?

42:52.600 --> 42:54.033
I don’t know. You’re not being serious.

42:54.080 --> 42:55.798
These are beautiful. Did I buy you these?

42:56.640 --> 42:58.153
He has his head in her crotch.

42:58.200 --> 43:01.510
I ask you, should that man be the governor?

43:04.120 --> 43:05.917
That’s the human touch.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.439
Yeah.

43:07.480 --> 43:09.789
Don, be serious.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.876
Did you really buy me the house?

43:12.680 --> 43:14.591
I swear the house is yours.

43:14.640 --> 43:16.596
Oh.

43:19.080 --> 43:20.274
Oh.

43:20.320 --> 43:21.389
My house.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.035
It’s her phone.

43:26.760 --> 43:27.795
Hello.

43:31.960 --> 43:33.837
I’m kind of busy now. I’ll have to call back.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.757
<i>I want him out of there now</i>

43:35.800 --> 43:37.119
OK. Bye.

43:37.160 --> 43:39.037
Who the hell was that?

43:39.080 --> 43:41.071
That was “the man.”

43:41.120 --> 43:42.314
Sounds kinda foreign.

43:42.360 --> 43:43.873
It’s Italian.

43:43.920 --> 43:46.639
That’s what I said. Foreign.

43:46.680 --> 43:50.150
I’ll cover that phone call, so you have the voice on it.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.433
Jesus Christ.

44:06.480 --> 44:08.994
Don’t you ever go to bed, honey?

44:23.400 --> 44:26.039
Can’t see.

44:28.200 --> 44:29.599
Victor.

44:29.640 --> 44:31.039
Victor.

44:33.960 --> 44:34.995
No.

44:52.280 --> 44:54.874
I love the sound of that door.

45:01.840 --> 45:04.912
The best gifts are those not asked for.

45:07.280 --> 45:09.191
You’re always invited.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.231
Never expected.

45:12.400 --> 45:13.833
You know what I leave

45:13.880 --> 45:15.757
on the other side of that door

45:15.800 --> 45:17.199
when I step in here?

45:17.240 --> 45:18.639
Did you get my call?

45:18.680 --> 45:19.749
The past.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.552
All of it. The future, too.

45:21.600 --> 45:22.635
All doubts,

45:22.680 --> 45:25.035
all questions and beliefs.

45:27.800 --> 45:29.836
<i>Did you get my messages?</i>

45:29.880 --> 45:32.872
I got all your messages even before you sent them.

45:34.040 --> 45:35.837
Victor...

45:35.880 --> 45:37.518
we have to talk.

45:37.560 --> 45:38.834
Come on.

45:43.640 --> 45:45.358
He has a place for me.

45:45.400 --> 45:47.755
I have a place for you.

45:47.800 --> 45:50.633
This is a house, Victor.

45:50.680 --> 45:52.557
My own place.

45:52.600 --> 45:54.716
Does he still think you’re a dancer?

45:56.920 --> 45:58.831
I <i>am</i> a dancer.

45:58.880 --> 46:00.472
She is a dancer.

46:00.520 --> 46:02.556
Well, come, then...

46:02.600 --> 46:04.318
dance with me.

46:11.720 --> 46:14.712
<i>I want everything tonight</i>

46:14.760 --> 46:16.955
<i>Everything we've ever done</i>

46:17.000 --> 46:19.514
<i>And everything we've never done</i>

46:19.560 --> 46:20.595
<i>Come</i>

46:24.360 --> 46:26.510
So, you have decided.

46:27.480 --> 46:28.708
Yes.

46:30.280 --> 46:33.431
This is a place to pass through on your way.

46:33.480 --> 46:36.790
People like us don’t stop, Dominoe.

46:36.840 --> 46:39.673
We have too much of the world in our eyes.

46:39.720 --> 46:42.075
We have seen it together,

46:42.120 --> 46:44.475
we’ve met the devil together,

46:44.520 --> 46:46.158
and we’ve been to heaven,

46:46.200 --> 46:47.997
haven’t we?

46:49.960 --> 46:51.313
No.

46:53.160 --> 46:54.752
And I am stopping.

46:54.800 --> 46:56.677
<i>I don't think you can</i>

46:56.720 --> 46:58.039
<i>For him?</i>

46:58.080 --> 46:59.308
No.

46:59.360 --> 47:01.237
For me.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.157
It’s time for me.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.350
Say good-bye, Victor.

47:07.160 --> 47:08.593
Please.

47:08.640 --> 47:10.995
All right. I’ll say good-bye...

47:11.040 --> 47:13.076
but not with words.

47:13.120 --> 47:14.519
Come.

47:14.560 --> 47:16.437
We’ll be artists...

47:16.480 --> 47:18.516
one last time.

47:19.960 --> 47:21.712
One last time?

47:21.760 --> 47:22.954
Yes.

47:24.760 --> 47:26.671
You mean it?

47:26.720 --> 47:29.393
Do I ever say what I don’t mean?

47:35.800 --> 47:37.233
I’ll make it the very best.

47:37.280 --> 47:39.157
Yes.

48:47.280 --> 48:50.192
<i>There's no sin</i>

48:50.240 --> 48:52.800
<i>He hasn’t sinned</i>

48:52.840 --> 48:55.354
<i>His life's a candle</i>

48:55.400 --> 48:57.595
<i>In the wind</i>

48:57.640 --> 49:00.154
<i>Always hanging</i>

49:00.200 --> 49:02.316
<i>By a thread</i>

49:02.360 --> 49:04.635
<i>With eyes</i>

49:04.680 --> 49:07.035
<i>Cold and dead</i>

49:07.080 --> 49:09.116
<i>His world</i>

49:09.160 --> 49:11.674
<i>Is neon lights</i>

49:11.720 --> 49:13.597
<i>Lonely streets</i>

49:13.640 --> 49:15.676
<i>And empty nights</i>

49:15.720 --> 49:17.597
<i>The only dreams</i>

49:17.640 --> 49:20.791
<i>Left to find</i>

49:20.840 --> 49:23.035
<i>Are in the shadows</i>

49:23.080 --> 49:24.672
<i>Of his mind</i>

49:24.720 --> 49:29.874
<i>But somewhere</i>

49:29.920 --> 49:35.358
<i>Some way</i>

49:35.400 --> 49:38.392
<i>Someone</i>

49:38.440 --> 49:41.079
<i>Some day</i>

49:41.120 --> 49:43.953
<i>Will show him love and then</i>

49:44.000 --> 49:48.755
<i>He’ll start to live again</i>

50:31.000 --> 50:34.470
<i>Well, the car was registered</i>
<i>to Far East Imports Incorporated,</i>

50:34.520 --> 50:36.750
<i>which is owned by Ibsen Properties</i>

50:36.800 --> 50:37.835
Which is?

50:37.880 --> 50:39.438
<i>Uh, which is I'm working on that</i>

50:39.480 --> 50:41.755
<i>So far, I got no Victors</i>

50:43.320 --> 50:44.389
<i>You OK?</i>

50:44.440 --> 50:46.237
Yeah. Bored.

50:46.280 --> 50:47.315
<i>Anything I can send you?</i>

50:47.360 --> 50:48.713
No, thank you.

50:48.760 --> 50:49.795
<i>All right</i>

50:51.440 --> 50:52.714
- Nosh.
- <i>Yeah</i>

50:52.760 --> 50:53.795
She just came in. I got to go.

50:53.840 --> 50:55.319
<i>OK Bye</i>

51:00.120 --> 51:01.758
Where the hell you been, for Christ’s sake?

51:07.200 --> 51:08.952
Hello, my angel.

51:24.240 --> 51:26.629
Come on. Open the drapes. Get some air.

51:42.440 --> 51:43.475
Want some wine?

51:45.560 --> 51:47.835
That’s good,’cause I don’t have any wine.

52:01.520 --> 52:03.875
How about a little pizza?

52:06.600 --> 52:07.749
God.

52:07.800 --> 52:08.994
Looks terminal.

53:17.040 --> 53:19.634
Who the hell is that?

53:31.600 --> 53:33.079
God.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.035
Police officer! Open up!

53:56.080 --> 53:57.877
What’s going on?

53:57.920 --> 53:59.831
- What’s your name?
- Henderson.

53:59.880 --> 54:01.233
Is that elevator on the 19th floor?

54:01.280 --> 54:02.395
- Yes, sir.
- Are you sure?

54:02.440 --> 54:03.475
Yes, sir.

54:03.520 --> 54:04.555
Police officers are on their way.

54:04.600 --> 54:05.635
Tell them to seal off the basement and lobby.

54:05.680 --> 54:06.795
Where’s your fire exit?

54:06.840 --> 54:08.239
There. Who’s coming down?

54:08.280 --> 54:10.032
If he gets past me, stay out of the way!

54:10.080 --> 54:11.354
I hear that.

55:26.440 --> 55:27.509
Don’t move!

55:29.480 --> 55:31.152
Fuck.

55:57.880 --> 56:00.348
OK, Nosh, hold it by the head, will you?

56:00.400 --> 56:01.719
Uh, let me see. That’s, uh...

56:01.760 --> 56:02.988
55 inches.

56:03.040 --> 56:05.349
This is not my favorite thing, you know, Barrett.

56:05.400 --> 56:06.515
I’m in Personnel, remember?

56:06.560 --> 56:07.595
<i>Only take a minute</i>

56:07.640 --> 56:10.108
<i>OK 45</i>

56:10.160 --> 56:11.832
Will you look at this apartment?

56:11.880 --> 56:12.915
<i>By the fingers, see?</i>

56:12.960 --> 56:14.598
It’s gorgeous.

56:16.120 --> 56:17.792
We’re on the wrong side.

56:17.840 --> 56:18.909
<i>That's it, right?</i>

56:18.960 --> 56:20.075
Wait a minute!

56:20.120 --> 56:21.599
Wait a minute!

56:21.640 --> 56:23.437
I see M.E.

56:23.480 --> 56:24.515
I see Forensics.

56:24.560 --> 56:26.152
I see Vice.

56:26.200 --> 56:28.589
Where the hell is Homicide?

56:29.760 --> 56:30.875
We didn’t call them.

56:30.920 --> 56:32.353
You didn’t?

56:32.400 --> 56:34.118
No. We want to do it.

56:34.160 --> 56:35.388
Do what?

56:35.440 --> 56:36.509
Handle it.

56:36.560 --> 56:37.754
Handle it?!

56:37.800 --> 56:40.075
You’ll handle yourselves right off the force!

56:40.120 --> 56:42.918
The rule is, Homicide gets notified

56:42.960 --> 56:45.952
before anybody takes a breath
or goes to the goddamn toilet!

56:46.000 --> 56:47.433
Homicide gets notified!

56:47.480 --> 56:49.152
Where’s the body?

56:49.200 --> 56:50.428
Morgue.

56:50.480 --> 56:51.629
What’s her name?

56:51.680 --> 56:52.749
Jane Doe.

56:52.800 --> 56:54.199
Oh, Jane Doe. That’s original.

56:54.240 --> 56:55.434
God damn it!

56:55.480 --> 56:56.595
How’d you get her down there?

56:56.640 --> 56:57.868
Ambulance.

56:57.920 --> 57:00.036
Probably a sawed-off shotgun...

57:00.080 --> 57:02.036
about 3 inches under legal, I should think.

57:02.080 --> 57:03.911
Looks like a cannon.

57:03.960 --> 57:05.359
Probably double-ought, you think?

57:05.400 --> 57:06.435
Maybe.

57:06.480 --> 57:08.357
He shoots her, then he walks away nice and quiet.

57:08.400 --> 57:11.153
We’ve got the whole thing on tape.
This guy’s very cool.

57:11.200 --> 57:12.428
Arch, for Christ’s sake, are you in on this?

57:12.480 --> 57:14.118
She was ours, Friscoe.

57:14.160 --> 57:15.229
Somebody blew her up.

57:15.280 --> 57:17.874
You know how far over your head you are?

57:17.920 --> 57:19.399
No. How far?

57:19.440 --> 57:21.829
Well, they’ll nail your asses to the wall!

57:21.880 --> 57:23.757
Mine, too, and I got 2 years to retire!

57:23.800 --> 57:25.472
You keep telling me that.

57:26.520 --> 57:27.669
I’m calling Homicide.

57:27.720 --> 57:29.312
Oh, bullshit!

57:29.360 --> 57:30.793
They’ll bury it. You know that, Friscoe.

57:30.840 --> 57:32.068
<i>Oh, shut up!</i>

57:32.120 --> 57:33.394
<i>No, they’ll lose it, Friscoe</i>

57:33.440 --> 57:35.237
Well, what can we do?

57:35.280 --> 57:37.316
I mean, we can’t go after Hotchkins.

57:37.360 --> 57:38.918
All you got is a tape.

57:39.960 --> 57:41.552
Would you look at that hole?

57:41.600 --> 57:43.113
Christ.

57:44.240 --> 57:45.719
<i>The killer stood</i>

57:45.760 --> 57:47.432
approximately...

57:47.480 --> 57:48.629
here,

57:48.680 --> 57:51.513
pressing the gun against the door...

57:51.560 --> 57:55.189
tall enough to get his body weight behind it.

57:55.240 --> 57:57.117
Probably a sawed-off shotgun...

57:57.160 --> 57:59.151
About 3 inches under legal, I should think.

57:59.200 --> 58:00.235
We’ve got the whole thing on tape.

58:00.280 --> 58:01.315
Shut up!

58:03.840 --> 58:06.229
This the same one who iced that Chink hooker?

58:06.280 --> 58:08.555
Asian, and I’m checking on it.

58:09.480 --> 58:11.596
And I’ll talk on you.

58:14.680 --> 58:16.989
Asian?

58:17.040 --> 58:18.393
College.

58:18.440 --> 58:19.509
Twigs...

58:19.560 --> 58:20.879
call me later when you finish the autopsy.

58:20.920 --> 58:21.955
Mm-hmm.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.752
- Barrett, come on.
- Hey, where are you going?

58:23.800 --> 58:25.233
I’m going to that building over there.

58:25.280 --> 58:28.431
Whoever iced that lady was watching her
at the same time I was watching her.

58:28.480 --> 58:29.799
There’s only one empty apartment over there.

58:29.840 --> 58:30.875
You were in it.

58:30.920 --> 58:31.989
There were 2 where people were out of town...

58:32.040 --> 58:33.792
I told you to shut the fuck up!

58:33.840 --> 58:34.875
He would’ve checked on it.

58:34.920 --> 58:36.831
<i>We're dealing with a professional killer here</i>

58:36.880 --> 58:37.915
<i>I mean, this guy is cool</i>

58:37.960 --> 58:39.075
<i>He's what I call an ice man,</i>

58:39.120 --> 58:40.792
<i>and he's not stupid, either</i>

58:40.840 --> 58:42.558
First door on the right.

58:42.600 --> 58:44.352
I suppose you’re going to pop it.

58:44.400 --> 58:46.197
Why don’t you just get the manager up here?

58:46.240 --> 58:48.674
He’ll get the house key. He’ll open it up.

58:48.720 --> 58:49.994
I was never good at this.

58:50.040 --> 58:51.917
Even when I was good at this, I wasn’t good at it.

58:51.960 --> 58:52.995
How about you, Barrett?

58:53.040 --> 58:54.075
Were you ever good at this?

58:54.120 --> 58:56.395
Yeah. I always liked it.

58:57.800 --> 58:58.835
Ready?

58:58.880 --> 59:00.313
No, no, no.

59:07.160 --> 59:09.276
This scares the shit out of me!

59:12.640 --> 59:14.915
<i>Well, we struck out again, right?</i>

59:14.960 --> 59:17.315
Will you shut up?

59:17.360 --> 59:18.793
Not everybody’s as neat as you are.

59:18.840 --> 59:20.432
You got to look.

59:26.880 --> 59:28.359
Barrett.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.831
Dominoe.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.715
Hey, Kitten. What do you say, my man?

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.751
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:42.869
Get out, bitch.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.195
What’s this?

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.798
That’s Valium... 5 milligram.

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:51.629
That’s funny.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:52.749
Yeah, yeah, that’s funny.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.119
5 fucking milligrams.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.479
Don’t bullshit me.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:04.277
<i>And I go on walkin</i>

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:09.393
<i>Walkin with those blues</i>

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.431
I’m going to drop a dime on your ass.

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.630
It’s going to be 30 fucking years for you.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.875
You’ve got a goddamn maniac out there
mixing Dee’s and PCP.

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:17.876
I ain’t going to waste my breath on you.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.195
That’s a lot of time.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.470
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.873
There was a buyer.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.433
There was? Yeah.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.833
Last month.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.472
How much?

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:29.919
Late last month. A thousand.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:30.995
Who was it?

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.075
I don’t know. I didn’t see the guy.

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.553
Oh, Jesus, Kitten.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:34.919
You’re talking to Arch here.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.951
- You don’t know who it was?
- No.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.911
- Are you the man in this town?
- Yeah, I’m the man.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.995
Don’t you ever stroke me, man.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.632
I’m not stroking you. I don’t know.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.715
Information.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.557
I’m trying to tell you. It was a tall guy.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.158
- What else?
- Caucasian.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.475
- Yeah?
- He had a mole on his face.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.397
A fucking mole. You going to give me that old line?

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.509
A fucking... a tattoo?

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.595
No, I don’t know about a tattoo.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.675
Look, let me talk to you.

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.755
Hold on. Where we going?

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.870
You know what?
You come downtown to get in trouble.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.955
- Is Arch there?
- Yeah.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.035
Do I help you out?

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.071
I looked for you last night.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.997
What did my partner tell you?

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.999
He said if any shit go down,
you were gonna shoot my dick off.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.119
That’s right.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.559
I want a name.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.033
I want a fuckin’ name.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.911
Come on, Arch, goddamn. You make it awful tough.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.632
I told you I didn’t see him. I didn’t get a name.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.557
- You know what I think?
- No. What do you think?

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.158
I think your fuckin’ ass is in trouble!

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.952
Oh, fuckin’-a, Arch! Come on! Goddamn it!

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.911
- Hey, this is Kitten, man.
- Can you fly?

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.996
No, but I talk better on my goddamn feet!

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.234
You better get some wings.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.111
You’re my buddy. You’re not gonna throw me.

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.479
- Is that what it is?
- Yeah!

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.794
All right. Well, good-bye.

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.875
Hey!

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.951
OK, I got a name. I got a name, Arch.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.116
Arch! Oh, you son of a bitch!

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.388
Wait. Now, come on.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.795
You all right? You’re all right, Kitten.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.909
Trust me.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.793
Man, you’re gonna hear from my lawyer, my attorney,

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.308
every-goddamn -body, you got that?

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.388
Oh, Arch, look, uh...

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.271
Let’s talk. Can we get over here?

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.992
You’re talkin’, Kitten. Quit bullshittin’.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.712
I’m not, man. Just get over here.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.318
We’re in the light. Come on, come on.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.554
What are you talking about?

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.318
Look, look, tell me something. What?

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.078
He’s lookin’ for us, Arch.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.953
That’s not the look of a winner, Donald.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.035
I loved her.

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.389
You loved her art.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.759
And she loved me.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.189
That was her art, creating that illusion.

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.468
Yeah, well, you’re wrong.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.875
You can be wrong, do you know that?

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:50.989
Do you think you’re God?

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.871
Heaven forbid.

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:55.434
I’m telling you that we loved each other.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.516
I’m sick of you twisting my life around.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:58.595
You went too far.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.119
There’s no such place.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.513
I’m telling you, you went too...

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.592
You can’t tell me, Donald.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:06.993
Now, shh!

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:11.876
But perhaps you can learn from me.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.797
You draw a clear straight line

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.239
to where you want.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.919
And you move. You do not stop.

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:20.758
You do not go around anything or anyone.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.870
She would have stopped you, destroyed you.

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:24.876
No. No.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.638
Stop the car.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:33.637
I’m on my way to what I want, Donald.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:36.592
I can take you with me all the way...

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:39.438
or I can drop you here now.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.237
She wouldn’t have hurt me, Victor.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:50.635
Open his door.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:53.114
I have a long way to go.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.957
Are you coming?

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.675
Drive.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.954
Hey, boy.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.513
Hey!

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.876
Good morning.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.593
Jesus Christ, what a great looking machine.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.198
OK, who’s got what?

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.117
Well, come on, put something on the table.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.195
Time’s gettin’ short.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.548
We got our nuts in a doorjamb, Papa.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:45.794
This is what the model looks like.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.068
Put that away. What’s the matter with you?

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.473
What the hell’s the matter with you?
Hard to come by.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.239
Somebody’s tracking us,
because they killed Kitten Holmes.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.236
- Kid who?
- Kitten Holmes.

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.236
He’s an informant. He gives me information.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.475
They killed him. They didn’t shoot him.

01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.748
They kind of just kicked his ass.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.028
I mean, they broke him like a stick.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.308
They kung fu -ed him.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:05.273
Anyway, I found out that our shooter has a bad habit.
He’s a junkie.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.197
Now, a buy went down last month.

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:09.879
That puts him in town about the same time
the other hooker got blown away.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:10.989
Can I say something?

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.109
No, no.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:16.517
The blind woman and Roper were shot at close range
with a silenced.22. Just one shot each.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:17.787
He’s very sure of himself.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.671
I’d say the same man killed all 3.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.358
Nobody ever sees him come in or go out.

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:23.788
May I speak now?

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.238
Jesus Christ, speak.

01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:27.111
I told you he was dumb.

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.194
Bureau made his print.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.719
No shit?

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:32.558
Carlos Scarelli, alias Billy Score.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:33.999
He’s 45 years old.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.393
I didn’t see it.

01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:36.475
I don’t care!

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.353
Great reputation.

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:40.719
Slave trade.

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:41.953
Little girls. They...

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.468
buy them, kidnap them,
then they break them down...

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.999
drugs, rape, whatever the hell it takes...

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.189
then they sell them.

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:48.434
They sell them?

01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:49.595
Who is “they”?

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.473
They is him and his brother Albert Scarelli.

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:54.670
Albert, he’s been out of sight for about 15 years,

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.517
but we got his ass, Sharky.

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.710
You got the name. That’s all you got.

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.033
How about a face?

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.559
Hey, a face.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.635
The guy on the left.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.511
Where? Let me see it. Will you...

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.787
I didn’t see it!

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.558
I don’t give a fuck!

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.988
That’s fantastic, fantastic.

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.792
Look at this. Which one is it? Which guy?

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:12.875
He’s the guy on the left.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.433
This picture’s about 20 years old.

01:09:14.479 --> 01:09:15.799
You make him, Sharky?

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:18.274
I don’t make him.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:19.992
OK, he’s been in town about a month, right?

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.075
He’s probably still here.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.714
You guys got 40 more hours,
then I turn it over to Homicide.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.398
I’ll call you at home, Sharky.

01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:26.475
I’ll be at her place.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.475
- Whose place?
- Dominoe’s.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:29.589
Oh, yeah?

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:39.670
<i>Is your figure</i>

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.870
<i>Less than Greek?</i>

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.231
<i>Is your mouth</i>

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:48.395
<i>A little weak</i>

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:53.676
<i>When you open it</i>

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.358
<i>To speak?</i>

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.789
<i>Are you smart?</i>

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.075
<i>But</i>

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:07.955
<i>Don t</i>

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.833
<i>Change a hair for me</i>

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:14.988
<i>Not</i>

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.113
<i>If you care for me</i>

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:21.469
<i>Stay</i>

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:25.229
<i>Little valentine</i>

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.592
<i>Stay</i>

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.675
What the hell are you doing here?

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.238
Tiffany?

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:45.869
<i>Tiffany, where are you? I'm back</i>

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.471
Where is she?

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.556
Tiff let you in, didn’t she?

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.395
Well?

01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.192
What are you doing here?

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:02.118
I was about to ask you the same question.

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:05.436
Well, I’m glad you can talk.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.675
But if you don’t get out now,

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.119
I’m gonna have to call the police.

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.388
I am the police.

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.670
Oh, yeah?

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.432
Sharky.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.152
Vice.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.395
A woman was killed here yesterday.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.078
We thought it was you.

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.394
What?

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.032
You said Tiffany.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:31.117
Was that the woman’s name?

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.391
Was that the woman’s name
that stayed here yesterday?

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.668
Tiffany?

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.195
Tiffany.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.078
You sure it was Tiffany?

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.156
No, I’m not.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.599
But somebody was here.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:51.517
Couldn’t you have taken it off the goddamn wall?

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.869
He thinks you’re dead.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.438
He thinks he killed you.

01:11:58.840 --> 01:11:59.875
Who?

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.433
William Score.

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.993
Scarelli.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.917
Did you ever hear of him?

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.916
No.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.313
Get your stuff together.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.112
We’re going to get out of here.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.595
Hello.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.119
Shark, the tapes are gone.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.195
What?

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.309
Yeah. They’re missing from the squad room.

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.395
I come over here,

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.759
and the fuckin’ tapes are gone from here, too.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.995
What are you talkin’ about?
All the tapes are gone?

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.429
Yeah. Except a few I was working on at home.

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.277
I can’t reach Arch, and I can’t reach Papa.

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.952
I’m gonna call May right now,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.638
tell her to take the kid and get out of there.

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:40.715
I’m goin’ home, Sharky.

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:43.479
Nosh, listen to me.

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.988
You got copies of Victor, right?

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.792
You got copies of Hotchkins?

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.034
Copies! I got fuckin’...

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.832
Don’t you ever let go, for Christ sakes?

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.388
Just go home, Nosh. I’ll call you later.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.839
Shark...

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:57.673
who’s on our side?

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:07.958
We got to get out of here.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.718
If he finds out you’re still alive,

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.716
he’s gonna come back for you.

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.795
Why?

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.353
He wants you dead.

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.072
Then I am dead.

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.519
No.

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:19.789
That’s dead.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.830
Where are we going?

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.871
Somewhere where you’ll be safe.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.593
South America?

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.269
Where have you been for the last 24 hours?

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.311
I went to the mountains.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.555
I like being alone sometimes.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.637
None of your business anyway.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.079
I see.

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:48.950
You told Tiffany you were going, though, right?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.115
Right.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.354
At dance class.

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:54.949
You know everything?

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.558
I don’t know Victor’s last name.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.068
I don’t know your first name.

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.678
Sergeant.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.437
Sergeant.

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:10.238
Tell me, Sergeant, just how big is your army?

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.271
They’re good men. You’ll be all right.

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:13.912
More than a hundred?

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.712
4.

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.796
- What?
- 4!

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.235
Great.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.639
Just one bed?

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.109
Yeah.

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.637
I’ll sleep on the floor.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:45.994
I know.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.549
Well?

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.192
Oh.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.236
Is this your place?

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.750
I used to live here when I was a little kid.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.155
My father sold the house right after the war.

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:15.510
It came up for sale about a year ago.

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.198
I come here every weekend.

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.435
I fix it up. I love the house...

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.596
Why do you have my pictures on your wall?

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:25.393
They are my pictures, aren’t they?

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:38.191
Why do you have my pictures all over your wall?

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:39.514
I don’t know.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.276
Does Victor use the other women like he uses you?

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:55.392
Does he pay you? Or does he own you?

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.788
You’re so goddamn smart, aren’t you?

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.713
He owns you, too. You’re just too naive to know it.

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:04.955
Nobody owns me.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.430
I don’t want to talk anymore.

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.357
I’m so tired.

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.477
You got to give me a little time.

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.511
We don’t have any time.

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.790
We’re fresh out of time.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.876
Can I just take a shower?

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:31.268
Over there.

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.317
<i>I forgot about the pictures</i>

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.352
What a putz.

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.955
Hope you don’t mind... I borrowed your robe.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.035
Sure.

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:22.712
Look, uh, we haven’t got much time, so, uh...

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:25.593
I got to ask you some questions, all right?

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.279
Can’t you just let me lie here for 5 minutes?

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.151
I just need a little nap.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.394
A nap?

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:35.393
Look, you had a shower. Now you want a nap.

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.317
Want me to bring you your supper?

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.032
This is not a resort.

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.310
We’re running out of time.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.430
Now, what’s Victor’s last name?

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:47.114
What good is all this gonna do, huh?

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.674
It’s gonna help me nail him before he nails us.

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:54.950
Nail Victor?

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.035
You?

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.230
Yeah, nail Victor!

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:00.191
Nail him before he nails us!

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.992
Now, what’s his last name?!

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:05.115
What the hell difference does it make?

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.879
God damn it! I’ll tell you the difference!

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:09.751
I’ll tell you the friggin’ difference!

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.234
He’s gonna blow us away!

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.032
Now, tell me his last name!

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.991
Did you watch us?

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.076
Did you watch all of it?

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:19.235
Shit!

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:24.872
How many other people did he set you up with
besides Hotchkins?

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.638
Did you enjoy watching us, Sharky?

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:27.715
Get off of that!

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.876
Why? Does it bother you?

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:33.754
Does it make you feel
like some pathetic peeping Tom, huh?

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.597
You bitch.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.712
Don’t make me call you what you really are.

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.753
So he bought you, and then what?

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.870
He didn’t buy me!

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:46.480
Well, what were you, a librarian?!

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:49.353
A nun?! A schoolteacher?!

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:52.430
I’m a dancer! Can’t you see?!

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:55.119
I’m... I’m a dancer!

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.833
I ought to punch your fuckin’ lights out!

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.231
So now you’re gonna hit me, right?

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.715
I bet you enjoy hitting people, Sharky.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.910
Sometimes, yeah!

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.311
That’s all you know, isn’t it?

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:18.352
Hitting and pushing and punching.

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.870
Does it make you feel good or something?

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.512
Sometimes, yeah.

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.792
God damn it!

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:32.909
God!

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.878
Ow!

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.392
I’m never gonna tell you!

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.476
I’m never gonna tell you his last...

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:47.717
I’m never gonna tell you his last...

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:50.035
Oh, God!

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.275
I hate you!

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.629
Didn’t you ever learn just to hold someone?

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:04.429
Yeah, I know how to hold people.

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.395
I just don’t have $1,000.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.918
Is this your bedroom?

01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:12.079
Used to be.

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:15.158
It was smaller then.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.792
Stained-glass windows your idea?

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:19.479
Uh-huh. I love stained glass.

01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.199
Is this chest yours?

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:24.753
It was my mother’s.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.314
When I was 9 years old...

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.918
I carved my name in the drawer.

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.871
- Tommy?
- Mm-hmm.

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:35.114
Is that your name, Tommy?

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.195
No, it’s Ralph.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.151
I just put Tommy there to fool her.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:49.708
Was the school always there?

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:50.954
Yeah.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.752
3 steps away,

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:54.950
and I was always late.

01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:58.838
You know...

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:01.348
I come here every weekend,

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:04.153
and those damn kids are out there playing.

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:07.395
I can’t work when they’re there.

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.795
I have to stop and watch it.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:13.513
I could watch kids playing all day long.

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:18.831
You’re a strange guy, Sharky.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.108
Yeah.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.596
That’s what everybody says.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.839
<i>Just find Sharky, huh? Tell him to come on in</i>

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:02.552
<i>He's so far over his head</i>

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.033
I hear you’re onto something big.

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:05.399
Just read my report, OK, Friscoe?

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:06.634
Read the papers tomorrow.

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:08.636
Everybody down there is so goddamn cheap

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:10.352
they won’t buy a goddamn paper.

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:11.628
Are you gonna talk to me?

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:12.715
No!

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.159
You just wait a minute.

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.235
You know something, right?

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:16.872
<i>Sharky was right all the time</i>

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:20.230
<i>One man on top of the whole town</i>
<i>and one fink inside the Department</i>

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:21.952
<i>Joe, I don't know where Sharky is</i>

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.353
You are an asshole.

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:24.628
Get on a phone and find him.

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:26.079
You want to help? Then tell him to come on in.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:27.348
Tell him it’s a goddamn fix.

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.277
Tell him there’s no way that he can win.

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.355
What’d you find out?

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.913
Never mind what I found out.

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.632
Joe, where are you going?

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.432
I’m going to the D.A. Now!

01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:38.472
<i>I'm gonna get Sharky</i>
<i>that head he's been hunting for</i>

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:41.472
<i>I've got the son of a bitch!</i>

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.834
Stop that son of a bitch!

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:50.233
Get back! Get back!

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.396
Get back! People, back!

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:55.113
Oh, Christ, Joe!

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:56.912
<i>He's dead!</i>

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:06.999
What are you doing?

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:09.913
Just working.

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.076
A window seat.

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:14.799
Yeah.

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.912
Did you make it?

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:25.032
Yeah.

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:26.149
It’s very good.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:27.235
Thank you.

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:30.078
What are you doing there?

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:33.635
Uh... just... doodling.

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:35.079
Doodling what?

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:36.553
Doodling.

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:37.635
Just doodling?

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:45.438
It’s a rose.

01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:00.159
Were you embarrassed to tell me
you were making a rose?

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:03.035
No.

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.119
Yeah, you were.

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.597
Yeah.

01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:12.632
You’re a strange guy, Sharky.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.432
I know.

01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.755
That’s what everybody says.

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:34.158
At the far table.

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:41.273
Thank you.

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.789
Oh.

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.512
Sergeant Sharky.

01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:57.630
Please sit down.

01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:59.796
No, thanks.

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.558
I just came to look.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.875
What do you see?

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:06.309
Nothing much.

01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:09.397
Care to have some food?

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.839
It’s Chinese food

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:12.996
without a trace of Western corruption.

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:14.268
Pure.

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.072
I’ve got you by the ass.

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:17.951
Oh?

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:23.469
All the way from selling little girls to murder.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.672
How does it feel?

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.359
It feels great.

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.356
It feels like you’re a lump of shit

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:35.279
lyin’ in the bottom of a commode,

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:37.629
and I got my hand on the chain

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:39.398
just waiting to pull it.

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:44.714
Look at you.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:47.797
Righteous anger. Defender of the people.

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.911
Tell me something, Sharky.

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:53.030
Why are the people on my side?

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.913
Why do they line up with me instead of you?

01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:57.632
Huh?

01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.750
Confusing times.

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:05.069
You have nothing.

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.714
No tapes, no link with Hotchkins,

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:08.988
except a dead woman.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.349
He’s as good as governor.

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:15.518
You’re an outcast
about to lose that badge of yours.

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:20.509
You’re about as bothersome to me
as something stuck to the bottom of my shoe.

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:23.154
As I see it, you have 2 choices.

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:24.952
You can disappear...

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.276
or maybe I can throw something your way.

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:30.788
Perhaps even another Dominoe.

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:32.558
Pick one. Go ahead.

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:35.876
Of course, she won’t be quite as good.

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.514
Dominoe was the best.

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:41.757
She was 12 when I found her.

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:43.199
Can you imagine?

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:46.789
I taught her, and I taught her,

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.717
until she began to teach me.

01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:50.352
Yes, she was the best,

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.994
because I created her.

01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:57.518
Anyway, that’s all academic,

01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:59.039
because she is gone.

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:02.397
She’s alive.

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:10.996
Have you talked to Tiffany lately?

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:18.630
Somehow I get the feeling
that your rear end is puckering up.

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:23.953
I’m gonna pull the chain on you, pal,

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.798
and you want to know why?

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.876
’Cause you’re fuckin’ up my city,

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:32.469
’cause you’re walkin’ all over people
like you own them.

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:35.478
And you want to know the worst part?

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:37.715
You’re from out of state.

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:03.674
Nosh?

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:29.874
Nosh?

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:02.908
<i>Hello, Sharky</i>

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.229
Hello, Smiley.

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.315
You look awful.

01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.032
You met the Chins, huh?

01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:17.317
Yeah. They’re delightful.

01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:18.952
Oh, by the way...

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:22.232
your friend, uh, Jojo...

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:26.034
he’s gone to that big police station in the sky.

01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:29.117
Oh, and... and also...

01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:32.277
Nosh... has gone there, too.

01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:35.232
You know, when you went to see the man,

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:36.315
you really pissed him off.

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.191
You should have just brought the girl in.

01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:42.711
She’d be dead, but Nosh and Jojo and all your chums
would be alive, and you, too.

01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:44.159
Yeah.

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.156
Paco?

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:01.517
What, is he auditioning for a job at Benihana’s?

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:05.758
Oh, you’re funny, Sharky.

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:07.518
OK.

01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:10.518
Now, let’s make this nice and simple.

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:12.596
I’m gonna ask you a question,

01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:14.551
and you’re gonna answer me.

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:15.669
Sure.

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:18.712
And it’ll all be over just like that.

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.877
Otherwise, he’s gonna take your fingers off,

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:23.831
one joint at a time.

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:27.839
And now, I figure you got about, uh... 10 answers,

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:31.156
and then, if you don’t bleed to death,

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.668
you’re gonna run out of joints.

01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:35.392
Now the question.

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:37.994
Where’s the girl?

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:42.115
I don’t know what you’re talking about, Smiley.

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:44.037
I don’t know anything about any girl.

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:48.794
I’m gonna ask you one more time.

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:51.558
Where is Dominoe?

01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:58.674
Ok, Sharky, I think we’ve arrived

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:02.395
at what the bullfighters call “the moment of truth.”

01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:09.988
I’m gonna ask you for the last time.

01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:11.314
Where is she?

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:16.994
I don’t know.

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.675
Come on, Sharky, yell.

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:31.631
Come on. It’s got to hurt.

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.318
It’s painful.

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:37.558
I mean, it’s not as though
it’s like you’re gettin’ a manicure.

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:40.910
We’re in the middle of a lake. Go ahead, yell.

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:44.032
Want to try for 2?

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.237
Now listen good.

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:49.919
Where did you take her?

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.551
I... I...

01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:57.717
I... I... I... I don’t know.

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:05.712
Now, look, this is embarrassing,

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:07.990
it’s pathetic, it’s pitiful,

01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:09.393
watching a grown man cry.

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:10.793
I don’t want the boys to do that.

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:13.195
Uh, guys, take a break. Get some air.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:17.993
You’re a crybaby, Sharky.

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:19.951
I always knew you were a crybaby.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.831
All that shit around the Department

01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:24.678
about Sharky the tough guy,
the tough cop, the macho man...

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:26.392
I knew you had no guts.

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:28.795
Not only that, you got no fingers.

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:33.315
Ok, Shark, let’s cut the macho shit.

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.510
Nobody’s here. It’s just you and me.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:39.314
It ain’t there.

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:42.238
I took your gun into protective custody.

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:43.872
What do you think we are, dummies?

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:45.478
We looked up your nose. We looked in your ears.

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:47.317
Every orifice.

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.591
Now...

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:52.198
I’m gonna lean in,

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:56.028
and you’re gonna whisper in my ear
where the girl is at.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:59.834
Then I’m gonna get the Chins in here,
and it’s gonna be over just like that.

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:04.396
O-OK... OK, Smiley.

01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.309
Good boy, Shark.

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:14.913
Shit!

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:25.955
God damn it!

01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:12.159
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:14.794
<i>the next governor of the great state of Georgia</i>

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:16.910
<i>Donald Hotchkins!</i>

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:24.959
Thank you. Thank you.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.513
<i>We want Don!</i>

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:28.596
Thank you. Thank you.

01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:30.039
Please. Thank you.

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:31.877
<i>We want Don! We want Don! We want Don!</i>

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:36.232
The governor has just conceded at 4 A.M.,

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:38.316
and I hated to keep him up so late,

01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:42.148
but I’m gonna... I’m gonna give him
4 long years to rest up.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.959
Every single one of you who voted for me

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.753
holds my IOU, my promissory note.

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:08.794
And I... I am accountable!

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.231
I am accountable!

01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:25.715
I am accountable for good government!

01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:29.469
I am... I am accountable

01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:31.590
for the cleaning up of this city!

01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:39.035
I am accountable for your piece of mind.

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:47.155
I am accountable for...

01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:48.519
the education of your children.

01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:56.673
I want to s...

01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:00.632
I, uh, I want to say to all of you...

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:06.589
I... I want to say...

01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:18.231
Don?

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:21.829
I want to say... I, uh...

01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:26.753
I want to say that...

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:30.990
<i>We love you, Don!</i>

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:32.792
Way to go, Don!

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:40.275
<i>Don! Don! Don!</i>

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:42.192
I don’t know what’s happening.

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:44.231
I’ll get a comment from the governor-elect.

01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:45.508
What’s your name?

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:46.913
Where are you taking the governor?

01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:48.109
Governor, what is this?

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:50.993
<i>2 men, identified as police officers,</i>

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.873
<i>escorted the governor-elect</i>
<i>from his campaign headquarters</i>

01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:55.319
<i>in police custody</i>

01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:59.319
<i>Whether protective custody or not, we don't know,</i>
<i>but sources have told Brian</i>

01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.351
<i>Hotchkins is being questioned by police</i>

01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:05.188
<i>where a man just elected governor</i>
<i>disappears immediately</i>

01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:06.559
<i>You lost the governor?</i>

01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:09.239
<i>I’ll buy another one Here's 20,000 for you</i>

01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:10.952
I’ll contact you later, OK?

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.035
No.

01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:16.596
Hey, Carlos, you misunderstand.

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:18.517
You can’t be seen with me.

01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:22.519
I can still make it if I move now,
quickly, and alone.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:25.120
But I’ll send for you
soon as I get set up somewhere.

01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:26.559
- OK?
- No!

01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:28.716
After all these years? You go to hell!

01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:31.638
“Send for me?” No! No! No!

01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:32.908
I go with you!

01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:35.269
Carlos, you’ll do as I say.

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:37.072
You’ll do as I say, as always.

01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:38.553
Please, Victor, please!

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:43.318
Look at you! You’re not strong enough!

01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:45.237
You’re a walking drugstore!

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:46.429
A dope head!

01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:51.158
You should try! Look at you! Junkie!

01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:53.634
A used-up butcher. Control all gone.

01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.477
I don’t need you anymore!

01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:58.910
Do for yourself now! Fend for yourself!

01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:00.359
Like my big brother?

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:01.435
Yes!

01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:02.913
Act like you?

01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:04.518
Well, try!

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:07.356
I will!

01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:08.435
I will try!

01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:10.152
All right.

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:11.792
I love you!

01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:19.033
I love you, too.

01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:22.038
It’s all right.

01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:24.036
It’s all right.

01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:46.996
<i>368, block off the underground parking area</i>

01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:48.439
<i>Cover all exits</i>

01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:50.835
<i>402, 402, move into the lobby</i>

01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:52.836
<i>Secure all elevators and stairways</i>

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:55.075
Nobody comes in, nobody leaves.

01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:57.270
I say again, nobody comes in or leaves.

01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:59.072
We’re gonna need a 1052 for a backup.

01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:01.395
<i>Roger Your 1052 is on the way</i>

01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:02.839
We’re set, Shark.

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:03.995
Let’s hit it.

01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:06.709
How many men we got down there, Jimmy?

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:08.830
There’s a hundred of them
at the bottom of the building.

01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:10.279
Son of a bitch!

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:13.595
Shit!

01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:18.237
He’s dead, Sharky.

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:23.435
He’s dead. For God’s sakes, Sharky, he’s dead.

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:32.156
- Who killed him?
- The brother.

01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:35.635
- What’s your name?
- Mongol.

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:38.069
Come here, Mongol. I want to talk to you.

01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:39.439
Jimmy?

01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:41.710
Go down to the 40th floor.

01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:43.034
2 men on a floor and work your way up.

01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:44.149
Yes, sir.

01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:49.918
Arch, this son of a bitch
is going to walk out of this building,

01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:54.875
and some goddamn traffic cop is gonna take him off!

01:44:54.920 --> 01:45:00.472
Sharky! Not more than 5 minutes ago
the son of a bitch is on the stairs. The fire exit!

01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:06.475
I’ll check it.

01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:07.555
Shit!

01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:20.796
I don’t like it.

01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:22.319
I don’t either.

01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:55.677
Sharky! Coming your way!

01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:23.231
Sharky!

01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:24.918
<i>Papa, where are you?</i>

01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:26.678
By the friggin’ door!

01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:29.393
<i>Don't move! It's the only way out of here!</i>

01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:32.193
Well, haul your ass. I ain’t gonna save him for you!

01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:45.118
Unh!

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:52.754
A fuckin’ ghost.

01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:01.675
Sharky, the guy’s a fuckin’ ghost.

01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:04.280
I just said that.

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.912
Yeah, you did.

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:07.996
You go that way.

01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:10.997
Yeah.

01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:27.674
Sharky, that better be you.

01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:29.635
It’s me.

01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:30.715
Jesus.

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:36.796
Sharky!

01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:39.513
You told Papa there’s one way out of here!

01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:43.633
You fucked up, you dumb shit!

01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:10.320
It’s not your fault, Papa.

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.276
He ain’t real.

01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:25.515
Son of a bitch!

01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:17.233
Oh, shit.

01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:22.358
You all right, partner?

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:27.712
Of course not, you asshole.

01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:30.553
I’m shot.

01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:34.190
Oh, shit.

01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:36.595
Where the fuck is he?

01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:43.671
He crawled off towards the stairway there.

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:47.076
Sharky, I hit his ass.

01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:50.908
He’s got 4 bullets in him,
and the fucker won’t go down.

01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:56.794
Maybe he knows more about Zen than you do.

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:00.118
Yeah. I tried to disappear.

01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:01.639
I bet you did.

01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:03.159
But I couldn’t.

01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:08.429
- Hang on. Hang on.
- Shit.

01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:09.799
There’ll be somebody here, OK?

01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.512
- All right.
- OK.

01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:14.074
- Sharky?
- Yeah?

01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:16.588
When you find him, you got to put him down.

01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:18.676
I’ll put him down.

01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:20.119
Sharky?

01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:21.878
Yeah?

01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:25.913
Smack his ass in the ground. You hear me?

01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:27.234
Yeah.

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:28.633
Sharky?

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:30.352
Yeah?

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:34.678
I’m talking about burying him
and putting a stake through his fucking heart

01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:36.358
’cause he’s not real.

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:40.709
I hear you, Arch.

01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:42.273
Sharky?

01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:45.314
Hey, Sharky?

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.794
I think I ruined a perfectly good jacket.

01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:20.079
<i>Ahh</i>

01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:48.352
Hello...

01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:49.913
Sharky.

01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:56.509
Do you know...

01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:59.472
what I was thinking?

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:00.589
No.

01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:02.596
Do you think...

01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:07.675
I’ll live...

01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:09.278
or die?

01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:15.750
Oh, you’ll die all right.

01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:17.597
No...

01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:20.712
No. No, I don’t think...

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:23.115
I don’t think so.

01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:26.118
Not... not by you.

01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:29.159
Die!

01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:30.758
Die!

01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:50.668
<i>As I turn the pages of my life</i>

01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:53.439
<i>All the days go spinning by</i>

01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:57.996
<i>Too quick for me to read between the lines</i>

01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:01.032
<i>There's no future in the past</i>

01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:03.878
<i>I've saved the best for last</i>

01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:06.309
<i>To look at me now</i>

01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:13.118
<i>You would never believe</i>

01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:15.720
<i>Before you</i>

01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:20.880
<i>My life ran in circles to nowhere</i>

01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:23.195
<i>Before you</i>

01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:27.472
<i>The same day played over and over</i>

01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:30.273
<i>Before you</i>

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:34.711
<i>I was a face at the rail</i>

01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:37.433
<i>Of a ship setting sail</i>

01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:42.600
<i>With no one waving good-bye</i>

01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:43.834
<i>Before you</i>

01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:45.074
<i>Before you</i>

01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:51.275
<i>Before you came into my life</i>

01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:00.719
<i>You're a woman who understands</i>

01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:03.149
<i>The meaning of a man</i>

01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:04.349
<i>You take me as I am</i>

01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:08.075
<i>But leave me free to be</i>

01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:11.112
<i>I see the reason for my life</i>

01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:13.435
<i>Shining in your eyes</i>

01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:19.953
<i>I look at you now, and it's hard to believe</i>

01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:24.679
<i>Before you</i>

01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:29.999
<i>My life ran in circles to nowhere</i>

01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:32.600
<i>Before you</i>

01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:37.031
<i>The same day played over and over</i>

01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:39.594
<i>Before you</i>

01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:44.236
<i>I was that face at the rail</i>

01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:46.794
<i>Of a ship setting sail</i>

01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:51.516
<i>With no one waving good-bye</i>

01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:53.039
<i>Before you</i>

01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:54.513
<i>Before you</i>

01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:00.237
<i>Before you came into my life</i>

01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:04.311
<i>Before you</i>

01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:06.157
<i>Before you</i>

01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:09.033
<i>Before you came</i>

01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:14.791
<i>In to</i>

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:17.832
<i>My</i>
