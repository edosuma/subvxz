<i>Previously on Ugly Betty...</i>

00:03.539 --> 00:05.302
<i>You have a secret husband?</i>

00:05.374 --> 00:06.739
Booze and pills weren't enough.

00:06.809 --> 00:07.798
I'm sick!

00:07.877 --> 00:14.475
If I can't marry into the Meade family,
I will give birth to an heir.

00:14.549 --> 00:16.517
We need to find a surrogate
we can control.

00:16.585 --> 00:18.576
<i>Someone who's desperate for money.</i>

00:18.653 --> 00:22.316
<i>I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Mode,
and this office is now a nursery.</i>

00:22.424 --> 00:26.520
But I'm your father, you are my son,
and we're in this together.

00:26.628 --> 00:27.822
You're telling me that you're married?

00:27.896 --> 00:30.694
I just wanted you to know,
because I feel like I'm falling for you.

00:31.933 --> 00:34.264
Betty. Hey.
Welcome to our new home.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.860
I really wanna take on
more responsibility.

00:36.937 --> 00:40.304
<i>I just... I thought that
that was gonna be at Mode.</i>

00:53.787 --> 00:57.223
<i>Daniel, when I said
that Player magazine</i>

00:57.290 --> 00:59.690
should show women
in a more professional light,

00:59.759 --> 01:01.784
this isn't exactly what I had in mind.

01:01.895 --> 01:06.059
Betty, that's your concept,
"America's Hottest Lawyers. "

01:06.132 --> 01:09.431
I pitched
"America's Top Female Attorneys. "

01:09.502 --> 01:11.094
<i>Look, I know this is Player magazine,</i>

01:11.171 --> 01:15.266
but does every spread have
to be women in skimpy bras?

01:15.340 --> 01:18.309
Know what? You're right.
I hadn't thought of that.

01:18.377 --> 01:20.470
- Let's lose those bras, please!
Lose them.

01:20.546 --> 01:22.707
No, that's not what I meant!

01:27.486 --> 01:29.477
That's not what I meant.

01:30.889 --> 01:33.255
What are you working on?

01:33.325 --> 01:35.622
Nothing. Just doodling, you know.

01:35.693 --> 01:38.389
<i>- Is that Mode?
- No, it's just...</i>

01:38.462 --> 01:41.260
It's just a mockup for
Wilhelmina's first issue. I don't know.

01:41.332 --> 01:43.960
<i>I knew it, Daniel.
Part of you wants to be back at Mode.</i>

01:44.035 --> 01:46.697
No, look, I just want to see
what Wilhelmina's up to.

01:46.771 --> 01:48.329
You know exactly what she's up to,

01:48.406 --> 01:51.475
firing, scheming,
looking for a puppy to kick.

01:51.510 --> 01:54.545
Well, then I'm happy to be away from it.

01:54.580 --> 01:56.136
See? Happy!

02:01.184 --> 02:04.153
It's Daniel's copy of the mockup.

02:04.221 --> 02:07.452
Crap. I forgot we still send it to him.
I'll make sure we take him off the list.

02:07.524 --> 02:09.082
Nope, that's not why I'm here.

02:09.326 --> 02:12.523
You see, Alexis, there are
a lot of notes in here, and they're good.

02:12.596 --> 02:14.496
I'm sure he has a lot of notes.

02:14.564 --> 02:17.361
It's Wilhelmina's first issue,
and he hates Wilhelmina.

02:17.433 --> 02:19.526
No. See, these aren't
the notes of somebody

02:19.602 --> 02:21.467
who wants to get to Wilhelmina.

02:21.537 --> 02:24.995
"Cover is too obscure. " "Will it sell?"
"Pull up key ads. "

02:25.074 --> 02:27.042
<i>"Where is 'Mode Girl on Madison'?"</i>

02:27.109 --> 02:30.510
<i>Alexis, he cares about this magazine.
He misses Mode.</i>

02:30.579 --> 02:33.776
I mean, he won't admit it,
but he belongs here.

02:34.483 --> 02:37.883
I appreciate your loyalty
to your boss, Betty,

02:37.952 --> 02:40.750
<i>but Daniel doesn't work
at Mode anymore.</i>

02:41.589 --> 02:45.218
Okay. Well, thanks for your time.

02:54.702 --> 02:56.636
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

02:56.704 --> 03:01.163
What's more romantic than lunch
on foot with a view of Rikers Island?

03:02.809 --> 03:04.276
Okay.

03:06.179 --> 03:11.116
You know, you deserve better
than week-old lamb.

03:11.184 --> 03:12.811
- Yeah.
- How about

03:14.688 --> 03:16.679
a real date?

03:16.790 --> 03:18.018
Really?

03:18.091 --> 03:21.321
Yeah, Jill got called for a layover flight
leaving Wednesday morning.

03:21.394 --> 03:25.524
I'm thinking maybe Wednesday night
we could do something special.

03:28.668 --> 03:32.604
Whoa. Hey,
what happened to the smile?

03:32.672 --> 03:34.970
No, nothing, I just...

03:35.041 --> 03:39.671
I try to forget that you have a wife,
but you have a wife.

03:39.745 --> 03:41.735
And I told you how things stand.

03:41.846 --> 03:47.580
Coach, everything that you said to me
about us having a future together,

03:48.653 --> 03:52.282
just be honest with me. Is that for real?

03:53.325 --> 03:58.194
I promise, you're not the other woman.
You're the only woman.

04:00.765 --> 04:02.698
But if you take this shot
and put it right here,

04:02.766 --> 04:04.393
it draws your eye right to the ad.

04:04.468 --> 04:08.632
Alexis, we go to print tonight.
My launch party's in two days.

04:08.706 --> 04:09.798
There's time.

04:09.873 --> 04:11.306
And what about this cover?

04:11.375 --> 04:13.366
Angelina Jolie in a block of ice?

04:13.444 --> 04:17.175
I mean, do you have a shot
that's a little less arty?

04:17.281 --> 04:18.976
Or at least one
where you can see who it is?

04:19.083 --> 04:22.882
Wait a minute. Those aren't your notes.

04:25.421 --> 04:28.185
The rounded "O's"
of a stunted adolescent,

04:28.257 --> 04:31.852
the stiff "T's" of someone
who's clearly overcompensating.

04:31.928 --> 04:33.657
This is Daniel's handwriting.

04:34.864 --> 04:38.095
Yes, these are Daniel's notes,
and I happen to agree with them.

04:38.167 --> 04:39.828
Why is he even giving you notes?

04:39.902 --> 04:42.597
He isn't. Betty found them
and brought them to me.

04:42.671 --> 04:45.071
Now why don't you put your ego aside
for a second

04:45.140 --> 04:47.574
and just admit
that your issue needs help?

04:47.676 --> 04:49.803
<i>I mean, where's our
"Mode Girl on Madison" feature?</i>

04:49.911 --> 04:52.539
Who cares what the average woman
wears on the street?

04:52.647 --> 04:53.875
We shouldn't be taking their pictures.

04:53.949 --> 04:55.314
We should be throwing rocks at them.

04:55.384 --> 04:56.874
I think our readers like it.

04:56.985 --> 04:59.283
Our readers like what I tell them to like.

04:59.354 --> 05:01.447
<i>Look, we agreed that
Mode needed a kick in the ass.</i>

05:01.523 --> 05:03.251
I'm giving it a kick in the ass.

05:03.324 --> 05:05.315
I never tire of you saying that.

05:06.360 --> 05:09.158
Just take a look at Daniel's notes.

05:09.230 --> 05:11.061
Of course.

05:11.132 --> 05:12.599
Well, she...

05:13.434 --> 05:16.232
- I see someone's gonna be a problem.
- Daniel?

05:16.303 --> 05:19.636
Daniel is an overripe cantaloupe,
tumbling toward irrelevance.

05:19.707 --> 05:21.698
I'm talking about Betty.

05:21.776 --> 05:25.575
She's trying to get Daniel back in here.
She's the problem.

05:27.280 --> 05:29.214
Okay, lunch.

05:33.186 --> 05:34.813
No burrito for you!

05:34.888 --> 05:38.415
- Marc, why did you do that?
- You have a lunch date.

05:38.491 --> 05:41.324
- With you?
- No. With Wilhelmina.

05:45.397 --> 05:50.198
Look at us, two women of color
out for a fancy lunch on the town.

05:51.203 --> 05:53.694
Isn't this fun, girlfriend?

05:55.507 --> 05:56.804
I guess.

05:58.010 --> 06:02.344
And that blouse is heaven.
Where did you get it? I love it.

06:02.414 --> 06:04.348
Okay, no, you don't.

06:04.416 --> 06:07.907
No, I don't. It's hideous,
like driving through Ohio.

06:07.985 --> 06:10.715
Look, let's cut to the chase, Betty.

06:10.788 --> 06:13.416
- I need you.
- What?

06:13.491 --> 06:17.484
You kept Daniel's files.
Marc can't make heads or tails of them.

06:17.728 --> 06:18.752
Um...

06:18.830 --> 06:20.195
Okay, yeah, fine.

06:20.264 --> 06:23.427
I'll ask Daniel for a little bit of time
to come and work on them.

06:23.501 --> 06:28.028
Or you could recognize
a career opportunity when you see one.

06:28.972 --> 06:32.840
<i>Betty, you were the assistant to
the Editor-in-Chief at Mode before.</i>

06:32.909 --> 06:36.310
I think it's time you returned
to where you belong.

06:36.880 --> 06:41.442
<i>- Are you offering me a job?
- At Mode. Working for me.</i>

06:44.287 --> 06:46.847
Look, Wilhelmina,
I'm not leaving Daniel.

06:46.923 --> 06:49.652
And to be frank,

06:51.460 --> 06:53.655
I don't really trust you.

06:53.729 --> 06:58.757
Loyalty and suspicion,
two very admirable qualities.

07:00.336 --> 07:04.500
<i>Betty, you belong at Mode,
and I think Daniel would understand.</i>

07:05.474 --> 07:07.873
Well, I think Daniel will say
that you want to hire me

07:07.942 --> 07:10.502
to ask me to do very bad, bad things.

07:11.146 --> 07:16.550
I would never ask you to do anything
wrong, ugly or morally suspect.

07:16.618 --> 07:18.779
That's what I have Marc for, dear.

07:18.853 --> 07:23.222
<i>Don't answer now, but don't
throw your future away at Player.</i>

07:29.463 --> 07:32.432
- She offered you a raise, too?
- A little one, yeah.

07:32.499 --> 07:34.296
Every bit helps
when you have a new apartment.

07:34.368 --> 07:37.963
Dad, I am not going to sell out Daniel
to pay my rent.

07:38.071 --> 07:41.268
You're not selling anyone out when
you're making a good career move.

07:41.341 --> 07:45.607
<i>Aunt Betty, you have to go back
to Mode! Player gets me nothing!</i>

07:45.679 --> 07:50.047
It's like I'm stuck in a sand trap
at the bottom of the ninth quarter.

07:51.417 --> 07:53.408
Listen to me, I'm already changing!

07:54.120 --> 07:55.781
That reminds me, Tony wanted to know

07:55.855 --> 07:58.050
<i>if he could have one of
those signed Player covers</i>

07:58.124 --> 08:00.319
with all the star athletes
for the school auction.

08:00.393 --> 08:02.759
Sure, yeah, Hilda. I'll just ask Daniel,

08:02.828 --> 08:04.728
right after I tell him
that his mortal enemy

08:04.797 --> 08:06.628
offered me a better job with more pay!

08:06.699 --> 08:09.532
Opportunities are coming your way.
This is something to be proud of.

08:09.635 --> 08:11.761
I don't think that's how
Daniel's gonna see it, Dad.

08:11.870 --> 08:14.600
I feel like I was cheating
just talking to Wilhelmina.

08:14.673 --> 08:17.608
You're not cheating! It's not cheating
to explore other options

08:17.676 --> 08:20.509
because your situation
is at a dead end!

08:22.347 --> 08:25.316
I just... I care about you. That's all.

08:25.383 --> 08:28.443
Well, one thing is for sure, I have to go
in there first thing in the morning

08:28.520 --> 08:30.181
and tell Daniel that
I spoke to Wilhelmina,

08:30.255 --> 08:33.018
because secrets in that place
have a way of going bad.

08:39.029 --> 08:40.826
Someone's working late.

08:40.931 --> 08:43.525
Yeah, just came by
to pick up a little homework.

08:43.634 --> 08:44.828
Yeah, lucky I ran into you.

08:44.935 --> 08:47.495
I want to make sure
you're coming to my launch party.

08:47.605 --> 08:49.664
- Well, I hadn't...
- Wonderful.

08:49.740 --> 08:51.832
You know, I'm so glad we're talking.

08:51.908 --> 08:55.002
I know it seems like
I'm trying to poach your assistant.

08:55.078 --> 08:56.170
Excuse me?

08:56.246 --> 08:59.682
Betty did tell you we spoke about her
coming to work for me, didn't she?

08:59.749 --> 09:02.775
I mean,
I know you two have no secrets.

09:02.852 --> 09:03.944
Uh...

09:04.153 --> 09:05.313
Yeah.

09:07.323 --> 09:08.984
Good. It's all out in the open, then.

09:09.058 --> 09:11.151
Of course it's out in the open.

09:11.227 --> 09:14.389
I mean, everything's out in the open
between me and Betty.

09:14.796 --> 09:17.526
- How could you hide this from me?
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

09:17.633 --> 09:19.362
God, just the thought of it!

09:19.468 --> 09:22.494
You sitting at her desk,
rolling calls for her?

09:22.604 --> 09:25.004
Daniel, I don't want to leave you!

09:25.073 --> 09:26.563
Then why are you going
behind my back?

09:26.642 --> 09:28.974
- It wasn't like that!
- Okay, well, tell me what happened.

09:29.044 --> 09:30.807
Please. You met with her.

09:30.879 --> 09:34.006
She offered you a job,
and you didn't say no.

09:34.081 --> 09:38.177
<i>Daniel, working at Player magazine
isn't exactly my dream job!</i>

09:41.455 --> 09:43.252
I'm not happy here.

09:44.358 --> 09:46.053
I am.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.424
Are you?

09:47.495 --> 09:50.362
Just stop. Right now.

09:50.464 --> 09:51.931
I'm not leaving.

09:51.999 --> 09:54.694
Do you understand?
This is what I want.

09:55.368 --> 09:58.303
Well, maybe it's not what I want.

09:58.371 --> 10:01.738
Look, you want to go work
for Wilhelmina, be my guest.

10:01.808 --> 10:04.777
Daniel, can we please just talk
about this reasonably?

10:04.844 --> 10:08.041
I am being utterly reasonable!
If you hate it here,

10:08.114 --> 10:11.242
if you think you'll be so much happier
working for Wilhelmina, go!

10:11.318 --> 10:15.048
- Is that what you want me to do?
- Is that what you want to do?

10:19.058 --> 10:22.152
Wilhelmina, does the offer still stand?

10:41.646 --> 10:45.013
<i>Daniel's like a different person
since he's been at Player.</i>

10:45.083 --> 10:47.881
All of the fight
and ambition is out of him.

10:47.952 --> 10:50.147
You can't make people change, Betty.

10:50.221 --> 10:52.212
At some point,
you've gotta look out for yourself.

10:52.290 --> 10:55.657
I know. You're right,
but I'm working for Wilhelmina.

10:55.760 --> 10:58.523
I know.
The Wicked Witch of the East Side.

10:58.628 --> 11:00.823
- But you're a smart girl.
- I am,

11:00.897 --> 11:02.831
and I know exactly
what she's capable of,

11:02.899 --> 11:06.300
so I'll just keep my eyes open
at all times.

11:06.370 --> 11:10.204
Truth be told, I'm glad you're back.

11:13.210 --> 11:16.008
Christina must have a donut
in her pocket.

11:16.079 --> 11:21.607
Betty Suarez, under my rule.
How I have longed for this day.

11:21.684 --> 11:23.743
Marc, we don't want her to quit.

11:23.819 --> 11:26.447
We just want her to stay away
from Daniel for a while.

11:26.522 --> 11:28.513
Just keep her busy.

11:30.092 --> 11:34.426
Betty Suarez! Our newest employee!

11:35.231 --> 11:37.926
- Marc.
- Complimentary mimosa?

11:37.999 --> 11:40.229
- Really?
- No.

11:40.301 --> 11:45.329
But if you get the filing right,
I won't beat you with a bag of oranges.

11:45.407 --> 11:46.897
You be nice to her.

11:46.975 --> 11:49.910
Don't eat or drink anything
that he gives you, okay?

11:51.146 --> 11:54.445
Don't be silly.
Betty's on Team Slater now.

11:54.516 --> 11:56.575
There will be no drugging of you.

11:56.651 --> 11:59.813
Okay, seriously,
you can't touch my nose anymore.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.117
I don't understand. A hold up?

12:04.224 --> 12:06.658
I thought his immigration papers
were going through this week.

12:06.727 --> 12:07.694
I'm sorry, Mr. Meade.

12:07.795 --> 12:11.731
Your son's grandparents in France
filed a claim for custody.

12:11.832 --> 12:15.268
No, no, no. I... Look, I talked
to them already. They agreed...

12:15.335 --> 12:18.668
Well, I guess they changed
their minds. They want him home.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.171
Well, he is home. I'm his father!

12:20.239 --> 12:22.230
Look, you have to do
something about this.

12:22.308 --> 12:23.798
The State Department
has to be able to do...

12:23.876 --> 12:26.777
Your family connections at the State
can help expedite immigration,

12:26.846 --> 12:29.076
but they filed a claim in court.

12:29.148 --> 12:31.048
This could turn into
a real custody battle.

12:31.117 --> 12:35.611
Daniel Jr. lost his mother.
He's not gonna lose his father, too.

12:35.721 --> 12:37.416
These things can get ugly.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.282
Your son is 13 years old.

12:40.392 --> 12:42.622
Maybe before you get involved
in a big legal battle,

12:42.694 --> 12:45.527
you should ask him
what he wants to do.

13:11.789 --> 13:15.691
Don't interrupt, be invisible,
and if Penelope del Rios asks,

13:15.759 --> 13:19.354
you're a huge fan of her cosmetics,
you can't live without them.

13:19.430 --> 13:21.421
- I don't wear del Rios' cosmetics.
- Hold on.

13:24.434 --> 13:25.901
Yes, you do!

13:26.169 --> 13:28.103
Take a look, Penelope.
I think you'll agree

13:28.171 --> 13:33.006
<i>the new Mode is more upscale,
more chic, exactly your demographic.</i>

13:33.076 --> 13:35.442
You'll kick yourself
if you don't take another two pages.

13:35.512 --> 13:38.879
<i>Yes, but we've been advertising
in Mode for two years now,</i>

13:38.948 --> 13:41.416
and there's been no uptick in our sales.

13:41.484 --> 13:44.145
I see no reason to spend more money.

13:45.053 --> 13:46.748
No, that's for...

13:49.992 --> 13:52.290
- Enjoy.
- Thank you, Betty.

13:53.428 --> 13:57.956
Not so fast. Tell me, Betty,

13:58.834 --> 14:01.200
do you use my cosmetics?

14:08.309 --> 14:09.435
No.

14:10.545 --> 14:13.514
I'm... I can't afford them. Sorry.

14:13.581 --> 14:17.278
I do! I'd rather starve
than go without your night cream.

14:19.787 --> 14:23.188
We are coming out with a budget line,
you know.

14:23.257 --> 14:26.123
<i>Really? Well, you should advertise that
in Mode.</i>

14:27.360 --> 14:30.010
I very much doubt
the del Rios budget customers

14:30.045 --> 14:32.660
<i>are poring through
the high-end pages of Mode.</i>

14:32.732 --> 14:33.926
They totally do!

14:34.000 --> 14:37.163
<i>My sister, she has a salon in Queens,
and all those women love Mode.</i>

14:37.237 --> 14:40.673
<i>It's all they talk about,
all day long, Mode.</i>

14:40.740 --> 14:42.833
They just can't afford anything in it.

14:44.311 --> 14:48.770
Isn't that interesting? I think we just
found a way to sell your new line.

14:48.847 --> 14:52.715
This is good.
I came in saying no, I leave saying

14:53.719 --> 14:54.777
yes.

14:59.458 --> 15:02.091
Can you believe it?
My first day here and I help sell!

15:02.126 --> 15:04.725
Did you flip your wig?
I told you to be invisible.

15:04.797 --> 15:06.855
She asked me a question,
and I was helpful.

15:06.931 --> 15:09.729
Don't you get it?
Wilhelmina doesn't need help!

15:09.801 --> 15:10.961
You never outshine the queen!

15:11.035 --> 15:13.367
Yeah, well,
she landed a major advertiser,

15:13.438 --> 15:15.429
and by the way,
Wilhelmina totally smiled at me.

15:15.506 --> 15:18.441
She wasn't smiling.
She was showing her teeth.

15:18.509 --> 15:21.967
Betty! In my office, now.

15:33.590 --> 15:35.080
Wilhelmina.

15:36.927 --> 15:41.057
I just want to apologize
if I spoke out of turn in your meeting.

15:42.833 --> 15:44.926
I need some things
for the launch party.

15:45.002 --> 15:48.528
Run to Dior. Luke created
a signature perfume for me.

15:48.604 --> 15:51.198
Bee pollen. Make sure it's African.

15:51.273 --> 15:53.468
I need some cleansing milk
from Diane Bouchet.

15:53.542 --> 15:56.067
I also need the tiara
that Catherine the Great

15:56.178 --> 15:58.169
wore at her wedding to Peter III.

15:58.280 --> 16:02.011
It's part of the permanent collection
of the Museum of Russian Antiquities.

16:02.084 --> 16:03.949
- I want to wear it to my party.
- But do they even...

16:06.789 --> 16:08.585
- Could you give me a hint as to...
- Shh...

16:09.858 --> 16:11.155
Seriously, Wilhelmina, how am I...

16:11.993 --> 16:14.120
By the end of the day.

16:15.797 --> 16:16.821
Mmm-hmm.

16:19.901 --> 16:22.028
Come on, right here! Come on!

16:22.103 --> 16:25.072
Yeah, all right! It's coming. Oh, no!

16:27.709 --> 16:30.939
God, you're getting good at this,
aren't you? Are you having fun?

16:31.045 --> 16:32.103
<i>Oui, good time.</i>

16:32.212 --> 16:34.203
Well, I figured since you had
to start school tomorrow,

16:34.314 --> 16:36.646
we might get in one more day of hooky.

16:36.717 --> 16:39.311
Hooky? Like a prostitute?

16:40.454 --> 16:42.479
No, no! No prostitutes!

16:42.556 --> 16:46.424
Only when you're older.
I mean, not at all, Son.

16:48.162 --> 16:52.120
No, I just thought we'd talk,
you know, about important stuff.

16:54.300 --> 16:59.203
So, you...
You have grandparents back in France.

17:00.406 --> 17:02.135
Do you miss them?

17:04.609 --> 17:06.578
I love them very much.

17:07.613 --> 17:10.444
Maybe we can visit?

17:11.883 --> 17:14.511
Yeah. Yep. Sure.

17:20.125 --> 17:22.719
You don't want to talk more?

17:25.763 --> 17:29.757
Nah. You know what? I think
that's enough talking. Come on.

17:33.671 --> 17:37.004
I don't get it. I totally helped her
on that del Rios account,

17:37.108 --> 17:40.544
and now it's like she's trying
to torture me with a tiara.

17:40.644 --> 17:43.442
It's like she wants me to quit.
What's the worst she could do?

17:43.514 --> 17:45.778
Well, they say she once beat
an assistant with a car antenna,

17:46.917 --> 17:48.748
but I think it's just a myth.

17:50.121 --> 17:51.816
God, no, Stuart.

17:52.589 --> 17:56.047
- What? What's wrong?
- I think he's doing drugs again.

17:56.126 --> 17:58.924
What? Oh, my God, Christina...

17:59.462 --> 18:00.793
I took this from his stuff.

18:02.031 --> 18:04.864
It's gross! Put it away!
That's disgusting,

18:04.934 --> 18:06.697
but I don't think it means
he's doing drugs.

18:06.770 --> 18:11.173
I know, but it can tell me if he is.
I sent some hair samples to a lab.

18:12.075 --> 18:13.473
Well, what can I do to help you?

18:13.542 --> 18:16.773
<i>I need you at Mode, Betty.
You're the only ally I've got there.</i>

18:16.845 --> 18:19.313
So, please, just don't get fired.

18:21.216 --> 18:23.207
Well, I can try.

18:36.464 --> 18:39.592
Miss, I need you
to stand back, please.

18:39.667 --> 18:40.827
Miss!

18:42.236 --> 18:47.538
I'm sorry. Actually, I was wondering,
who do I talk to about renting this tiara?

18:53.414 --> 18:58.476
I mean, you don't have to laugh. I can't
be the first person to ask that question.

18:59.719 --> 19:01.744
Is there somebody else I can talk to?

19:07.661 --> 19:12.155
I know it's a crazy request,
but she really, really wants it.

19:13.867 --> 19:15.163
You know what? Never mind.

19:15.267 --> 19:18.668
You're probably just going to
laugh at me, too. Right? Okay.

19:22.608 --> 19:24.542
I'm guessing that's a no.

19:25.211 --> 19:26.508
This is my favorite part of the job.

19:26.579 --> 19:28.979
Injecting deadly poison
into my boss' head.

19:29.048 --> 19:31.278
Well, it helps that you have
really feminine fingers.

19:31.350 --> 19:32.908
It's a blessing.

19:32.985 --> 19:35.817
No luck with Catherine the Great,
Betty the Mediocre?

19:35.887 --> 19:37.445
You've been gone a long time.

19:37.522 --> 19:40.548
I know, I'm sorry,
I ran into a few troubles.

19:40.625 --> 19:43.651
I had to go to three different stores
to get your bee pollen, but I got it.

19:43.728 --> 19:45.889
And your cleansing milk
cost over $600,

19:45.964 --> 19:47.989
so I had to call accounting first
for authorization.

19:48.066 --> 19:51.035
- Where's the tiara?
- I don't have it.

19:52.670 --> 19:54.103
But they do.

20:00.143 --> 20:02.634
Turns out the curator's boyfriend
dumped her

20:02.679 --> 20:05.739
just because she gained a little bit
of weight due to an underactive thyroid.

20:05.782 --> 20:08.273
I know, it's so sad.
So, I just sat with her for like an hour,

20:08.352 --> 20:09.478
and I think that's all she needed

20:09.553 --> 20:11.350
was someone to talk to, you know?
To listen.

20:11.421 --> 20:15.881
Are we to understand that you got
the tiara by being nice to someone?

20:15.959 --> 20:17.983
Well, no. Not exactly.

20:18.928 --> 20:21.658
We also have to give the museum
a full-page ad in next month's issue,

20:21.764 --> 20:24.867
but I already talked to ad sales,
and we worked out a barter agreement.

20:24.902 --> 20:27.461
We give them ad space,
they give you the tiara for 48 hours,

20:27.570 --> 20:31.506
and also, Ed and Andy have to be
within 20 feet of the tiara at all times.

20:31.574 --> 20:33.235
If you ask me, it's just beginner's luck.
I mean...

20:33.309 --> 20:38.803
Marc, take off your gloves.
Betty will be doing my Botox today.

20:45.587 --> 20:46.679
Um...

20:46.755 --> 20:48.552
Don't you think a doctor should do this

20:48.623 --> 20:51.490
or at least a nurse practitioner?

20:51.559 --> 20:55.120
I'm so numb up there,
I wouldn't know if you hit bone.

20:59.400 --> 21:02.096
Betty, do you know why I hired you?

21:02.903 --> 21:04.962
To help with your files?

21:05.906 --> 21:10.536
I always suspected you were the brains
behind Daniel Meade.

21:11.879 --> 21:16.213
Well, no. That's just... That's not true.
Daniel is very smart...

21:16.283 --> 21:20.981
Yes, yes, yes, smart as a whip,
but let's talk about you for a moment.

21:21.054 --> 21:25.821
Betty, you passed the test.

21:29.195 --> 21:32.995
So, the tiara thing, that was a test?

21:33.900 --> 21:36.130
Because I thought that
it was some sort of punishment

21:36.202 --> 21:38.636
for speaking up in your meeting.

21:38.705 --> 21:43.107
On the contrary,
I was very, very impressed.

21:43.175 --> 21:49.307
And it made me think that
maybe you were the one.

21:52.017 --> 21:53.507
<i>Like Lord of the Rings?</i>

21:53.585 --> 21:55.075
Betty, there's only
been one other person

21:55.153 --> 21:58.884
who's been able to get that tiara, me.

21:58.957 --> 22:00.584
When I was Fey Sommers' assistant,

22:00.726 --> 22:03.922
she wanted that tiara for
her launch party of her first issue,

22:03.961 --> 22:06.259
and I did it.

22:06.330 --> 22:10.027
Of course, my methods were
a little less wholesome than yours,

22:10.101 --> 22:13.901
but I proved to her that,
given a seemingly impossible task,

22:13.971 --> 22:15.905
I could accomplish it.

22:16.640 --> 22:17.629
So?

22:17.708 --> 22:20.905
Betty, you've proved that
you have rare potential.

22:20.978 --> 22:23.241
That must be cultivated.

22:23.313 --> 22:25.645
I am going to groom you,

22:25.715 --> 22:27.842
and, Lord knows,
you need some grooming.

22:27.917 --> 22:32.684
You will be my protégé, and you will
start with taking over my launch party.

22:33.757 --> 22:37.284
- But that's Marc's job.
- And now it's yours.

22:37.394 --> 22:39.362
Betty, I'm offering you a future.

22:39.462 --> 22:43.261
After being my assistant, you could
write your own ticket in this town.

22:43.332 --> 22:47.325
And who knows? Maybe you'll be
the next Wilhelmina Slater.

22:56.645 --> 23:00.843
Marc, look, I'm hoping...

23:00.983 --> 23:02.917
I would rather eat butter!

23:02.951 --> 23:04.611
I haven't even asked you
to do anything yet.

23:04.652 --> 23:07.849
You bossing me around
is a crime against nature.

23:07.922 --> 23:11.891
- Marc, you're being ridiculous.
- Sorceress!

23:11.926 --> 23:15.384
You've taken away from me
everything that matters.

23:15.496 --> 23:16.986
Marc, look,

23:18.666 --> 23:23.433
I didn't try and take your job from you,
and I'm so sorry about this,

23:24.438 --> 23:28.101
but I have to try and make a launch
party happen in less than 27 hours

23:28.175 --> 23:32.805
and there is no way that
I could do it without you.

23:32.879 --> 23:33.868
No.

23:34.614 --> 23:38.983
So if you could please,
please, please try and help me

23:39.052 --> 23:42.419
find a life-sized, anatomically-correct
black vodka ice sculpture

23:42.522 --> 23:43.989
of you-know-who.

23:45.191 --> 23:49.093
And then she just waddles back in here
like a helpless brown Weeble,

23:49.161 --> 23:52.597
and while I'm not looking,
plunges my world into darkness.

23:52.665 --> 23:55.190
Poor baby. Come here.

23:55.267 --> 23:58.464
<i>Hush, little homo,
don't you cry</i>

23:58.537 --> 24:01.700
<i>Mandy's gonna steal you a Prada tie</i>

24:01.774 --> 24:03.799
You're nice, but don't touch the hair.
It's just how I like it.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.070
Okay.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.668
Hi, I'm looking for Betty Suarez.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.344
Hi, I'm Betty Suarez.

24:13.284 --> 24:16.310
Don't be absurd. I'm Betty Suarez.
How can I help you?

24:16.421 --> 24:19.015
Yeah, can you guys
just page her for me? Is that...

24:19.124 --> 24:21.718
Tony! Tony.

24:21.826 --> 24:23.384
- Hi.
- Hey.

24:23.495 --> 24:24.621
Sorry about them.

24:24.696 --> 24:27.994
No, no, it's okay. Is this a good time
to get that signed copy?

24:29.032 --> 24:32.900
<i>Right. I'll go down to Player and get it.
You wait here.</i>

24:32.970 --> 24:35.939
- Just maybe not so close to them.
- Yeah.

24:43.847 --> 24:46.213
- Here you go.
- Very cool.

24:49.285 --> 24:50.309
Did you see that Super Bowl?

24:50.419 --> 24:52.387
If I say yes, will you take your shirt off?

24:52.455 --> 24:54.923
Okay, and thanks for coming, Tony.

24:55.024 --> 24:57.515
Will you tell Hilda that
I'll call her later today?

24:57.627 --> 25:00.187
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Bye.

25:00.329 --> 25:01.353
Whoa!

25:01.397 --> 25:03.957
I need Mr. Sugar-Pants-Bedroom-Eyes'
number.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.798
Tony? No.
I'm not giving you his phone number.

25:06.869 --> 25:09.894
I need to see him again to give him his
phone which he accidentally left here

25:09.971 --> 25:11.529
when it fell out of his pocket
into my hand.

25:11.606 --> 25:14.370
Wait a second,
you pick-pocketed Coach Diaz?

25:14.442 --> 25:17.878
I was in a trance.
I barely remember what happened.

25:17.946 --> 25:20.346
But these pictures of him
kissing that slutty stewardess

25:20.415 --> 25:21.882
are really dulling my tingle.

25:21.950 --> 25:24.248
My sister is not a stewardess.

25:36.130 --> 25:38.257
But it has to be delivered
at 8:00 p. m. sharp,

25:38.332 --> 25:40.732
because it's an ice sculpture
and I don't want it to melt.

25:40.801 --> 25:44.100
Don't mind me, I took a train
for a half hour from Queens

25:44.171 --> 25:46.571
to eat soggy dumplings by myself
and watch you talk.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.505
Okay, I'll call you back
in the morning. Thank you.

25:48.576 --> 25:50.008
Hilda, I'm sorry.

25:50.076 --> 25:53.671
I have this launch party tomorrow.
It's driving me crazy.

25:53.746 --> 25:57.204
Okay, so I heard Tony was sexually
harassed by your coworkers.

25:57.283 --> 25:59.774
Yeah, that happens a lot in that place.

25:59.953 --> 26:03.184
Before I forget,
you have his cell phone?

26:03.223 --> 26:08.525
Right, okay, so, Hilda, this is
what I wanted to talk to you about. Um...

26:09.429 --> 26:12.591
Oh, God, this is... This is hard.

26:14.066 --> 26:20.699
So I saw some photos on Tony's phone
of him and another woman.

26:27.279 --> 26:31.408
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, Hilda.
Say something.

26:36.554 --> 26:38.385
It's his wife.

26:38.456 --> 26:41.914
What? They're, like, separated?

26:42.793 --> 26:45.318
Well, you know, it's complicated.

26:46.897 --> 26:49.932
What, you're dating a married man?

26:49.967 --> 26:52.594
See? This is why I don't tell you things,
because you judge.

26:52.669 --> 26:55.069
Yeah, because, Hilda,
that would be wrong!

26:55.138 --> 26:58.232
Well, I didn't know that he was married
when we started dating, and then...

26:58.308 --> 27:00.572
Hilda, what are you thinking?

27:00.710 --> 27:03.076
You have to get out of this!
This is just gonna end bad.

27:03.113 --> 27:06.913
Who says it's gonna end?
We're gonna make it work.

27:06.983 --> 27:08.917
Look, can't you just be happy for me?

27:08.985 --> 27:11.249
No! He has a wife.

27:11.321 --> 27:13.948
You think I don't know that?
You think that doesn't tear me up?

27:14.023 --> 27:16.389
- Well, then walk away!
- I can't!

27:19.361 --> 27:21.295
I'm in love with him!

27:24.933 --> 27:27.026
I'm not hungry anymore.

27:41.049 --> 27:44.348
Like I said, remember not to
get too hung up on any one girl.

27:44.419 --> 27:46.387
You're young. You gotta play the field.

27:48.356 --> 27:51.484
And listen in class, okay?
It's what I told you.

27:52.060 --> 27:54.290
<i>Écoutez le teacher.</i>

27:55.562 --> 28:01.057
Papa, your French is,
how you say, "sucky. "

28:03.136 --> 28:05.627
Just have a good day.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.816
You're a natural father.

28:29.095 --> 28:30.687
Am I being selfish?

28:30.763 --> 28:33.698
His grandparents want him back
in France. I know he misses them.

28:33.766 --> 28:37.633
Well, he can miss them
and still want to be here with his father.

28:37.702 --> 28:43.004
He's in a foreign country. He's away
from everything he knows, everyone.

28:43.108 --> 28:44.837
Don't you think
he'd be happier with them?

28:44.943 --> 28:48.037
It doesn't really matter what I think,
does it?

28:52.217 --> 28:55.251
I know. I have to ask him.

28:55.286 --> 28:59.585
I'm just afraid I'm not going
to get the answer I want.

28:59.690 --> 29:01.715
I don't want to lose him.

29:10.367 --> 29:11.800
Where do you want this ice sculpture?

29:11.869 --> 29:16.363
No, no, no, this can't be here right now.
The party isn't until tonight. She'll melt.

29:16.473 --> 29:19.635
Emily! Can you please take these guys
down to the Italian restaurant

29:19.742 --> 29:21.369
and beg them to let us
use their walk-in?

29:21.477 --> 29:23.445
I don't care if you have to
buy every pizza in the place.

29:23.513 --> 29:26.641
Just hurry.
We don't want her to start sagging.

29:27.683 --> 29:30.914
Guys, seriously,
can you stop goofing around?

29:30.987 --> 29:31.976
You know how Wilhelmina gets.

29:32.054 --> 29:33.681
- How does she get?
- Tell us.

29:33.756 --> 29:34.814
- Yeah, tell us.
- Tell us.

29:34.891 --> 29:36.916
Little Miss Thing here
has been working for Wilhelmina

29:36.993 --> 29:39.688
for half a minute,
and now she's all up in her gooch.

29:41.630 --> 29:44.463
I have been up all night
working on this party,

29:44.533 --> 29:46.967
and there are still a million things
that we have to do.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.263
A million and one, actually.

29:48.336 --> 29:51.794
Wilhelmina wants you
to shred all this old mail into confetti.

29:51.873 --> 29:55.604
- I'm busy. Can you do it?
- Let me think. No.

29:57.746 --> 30:01.408
Just because you're running this party
doesn't mean you can boss me around.

30:01.449 --> 30:03.440
And you may be in
Wilhelmina's good graces today,

30:03.484 --> 30:05.816
but that doesn't mean anything
about tomorrow.

30:05.886 --> 30:08.650
Loyalty is not one of
Wilhelmina's strong suits.

30:08.722 --> 30:11.792
But, you know,
I guess it isn't one of yours, either.

30:11.827 --> 30:14.283
What? I am loyal.

30:14.361 --> 30:15.828
Really? Is that why you dumped Daniel

30:15.896 --> 30:17.887
the second he got in the way
of your career ambitions?

30:17.965 --> 30:19.432
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.490
That's exactly
what Wilhelmina would've done.

30:21.568 --> 30:24.731
You two are a lot more alike
than I thought.

30:27.474 --> 30:29.169
Happy shredding.

30:35.482 --> 30:37.609
<i>Betty, you've proved
that you have rare potential.</i>

30:37.684 --> 30:38.844
<i>Work for Wilhelmina,
be my guest.</i>

30:38.918 --> 30:40.283
<i>Maybe you
were the one.</i>

30:40.353 --> 30:42.684
<i>If you think you'll be so much
happier working for Wilhelmina, go!</i>

30:42.754 --> 30:43.982
<i>You two are a lot more alike
than I thought.</i>

30:44.056 --> 30:46.251
<i>I'm so numb up there,
I wouldn't know if you hit bone.</i>

30:46.325 --> 30:50.022
- There you are, Madam Editrix.
- Thank you, Marc.

30:52.764 --> 30:55.733
Now be a dear
and go fetch me some carrot shavings.

30:55.834 --> 30:57.995
I'm feeling snack-ish.

30:58.904 --> 31:00.667
What the hell are you all staring at?

31:00.806 --> 31:02.773
Don't you have
some work to screw up?

31:02.807 --> 31:06.470
Look at me when I'm yelling at you!
Don't look at me!

31:06.544 --> 31:10.412
You, go fix your teeth!
You, stop eating that donut!

31:10.481 --> 31:12.711
You, lose 10 pounds!

31:12.783 --> 31:16.344
You're fired. You're fired.
You're all fired!

31:17.355 --> 31:20.916
Hi, Betty, it's Daniel. Remember?
We used to work together.

31:20.992 --> 31:23.050
- No time.
- No, no, no. Betty, I just wanted...

31:23.126 --> 31:26.425
- Security!
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait!

31:26.496 --> 31:29.693
No! I just wanted
to ask you a question! Please!

31:33.870 --> 31:35.963
What the hell is that?

31:39.242 --> 31:40.800
Not the puppy!

32:06.200 --> 32:08.760
Well, big date with the coach tonight?

32:08.870 --> 32:09.894
Mmm-hmm.

32:10.004 --> 32:14.168
Not wearing that.
Mom, leopard and zebra?

32:14.242 --> 32:17.507
They fight each other in the wild!
You'll never survive the evening.

32:17.579 --> 32:21.640
I think she looks beautiful.
And you know why? She's happy.

32:22.150 --> 32:26.779
Well, I'm not. Look, work with me here.
This is what I do.

32:26.853 --> 32:30.016
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

32:30.090 --> 32:33.617
<i>- And thank you, papi.
- You deserve this, mi hija.</i>

32:34.127 --> 32:36.425
Yeah. Yeah.

32:37.598 --> 32:38.826
I do.

32:42.669 --> 32:47.731
Okay, I know you're tired of
me saying this, but I have to.

32:47.807 --> 32:50.537
<i>You are wasting your time
and your talent at Player.</i>

32:50.610 --> 32:51.941
You are a good editor.

32:52.011 --> 32:53.672
- Betty...
- I'm not finished.

32:53.746 --> 32:55.145
<i>You belong at Mode, Daniel.</i>

32:55.214 --> 32:59.708
It is the most important magazine at
this company. Your family's company.

32:59.852 --> 33:00.978
You were good at your job,

33:01.053 --> 33:03.453
and if you don't believe me,
then read these.

33:03.489 --> 33:06.013
Wilhelmina had somebody hide
all the positive letters to the editor

33:06.057 --> 33:10.255
when you were in charge.
She was going to have me shred them!

33:10.362 --> 33:13.798
- They're all positive?
- All of them, and there are tons!

33:13.865 --> 33:17.232
Your June cover, the one that she said
was a pimple on the butt of fashion...

33:17.302 --> 33:21.466
- Well, she said that?
- Not the point! These people loved it.

33:21.539 --> 33:22.836
<i>And "Mode Girl on Madison,"</i>

33:22.907 --> 33:26.365
some of these people said
they subscribe just for that.

33:26.444 --> 33:29.469
Daniel, you have to show these
to Alexis.

33:29.546 --> 33:32.947
<i>- Come on, she doesn't care about me.
- She cares about Mode.</i>

33:33.017 --> 33:38.045
Yeah, okay, look.
I really appreciate what you're doing.

33:39.089 --> 33:42.217
<i>And, yes,
of course I want to be back at Mode.</i>

33:42.326 --> 33:44.556
Why do you think
I got so mad at you, Betty?

33:44.662 --> 33:48.620
Because you're there
reminding me of that, every single day.

33:51.234 --> 33:56.337
Wilhelmina won. I lost. It's over.

33:56.372 --> 34:01.071
Daniel, anything you truly want
has to be worth fighting for.

34:13.522 --> 34:16.786
You used me! You just
wanted the money to buy drugs!

34:16.891 --> 34:18.882
- Christina, that's not true!
- I think it is,

34:18.994 --> 34:20.859
because I had
a piece of your hair tested.

34:20.929 --> 34:22.418
What?

34:22.531 --> 34:25.226
They found OxyContin, heroin...

34:25.300 --> 34:27.860
It's like Rush Limbaugh fornicated
with Amy Winehouse

34:27.936 --> 34:29.129
and they spawned you!

34:29.203 --> 34:30.636
- You had me tested?
- Yes, I did!

34:30.705 --> 34:33.367
Why, have you got
a problem with that?

34:33.908 --> 34:35.569
You don't understand. Now just...

34:35.643 --> 34:38.304
Just get your hands off me!

34:39.880 --> 34:42.849
I swear to God,
I am this close to calling immigration

34:42.917 --> 34:44.407
and having you deported.

34:46.053 --> 34:47.315
Aye, right.

34:47.388 --> 34:51.221
What? You don't think I would do it?
Just you watch me.

35:10.410 --> 35:14.470
Yes! Papa, look,
I made it to the next level.

35:17.382 --> 35:20.909
Hey, could you come here
for a second?

35:25.023 --> 35:28.550
There's something I want to ask you.
It's important.

35:31.163 --> 35:36.259
Okay, so your grandparents want you
to come live with them in France.

35:46.344 --> 35:49.939
I want you to live here with me.

35:50.848 --> 35:52.371
Look, I guess...

35:52.849 --> 35:57.684
I guess what's most important here is
what do you want?

36:02.225 --> 36:08.391
You are my father,
and I want to stay with my father.

36:10.767 --> 36:14.827
Okay. Great, good.

36:15.671 --> 36:20.836
So, we'll stay together, and...
And we're gonna fight for that.

36:23.145 --> 36:25.978
Come on, let's see how good you are.

36:31.987 --> 36:33.851
Did you get a drink?

36:35.156 --> 36:36.953
Are you having fun?

36:38.626 --> 36:42.756
Betty, you've really outdone yourself.
This party is beautiful.

36:42.831 --> 36:45.026
You're not wearing the tiara.

36:45.099 --> 36:46.361
God, no!

36:46.434 --> 36:48.595
I'm the Editor-in-Chief
of a fashion magazine.

36:48.670 --> 36:51.138
I wouldn't be caught dead in a tiara!

36:51.206 --> 36:53.868
Right. Of course you wouldn't.

36:53.942 --> 36:56.341
Well, this is for you.

36:58.545 --> 37:00.706
It's my two weeks' notice.

37:01.548 --> 37:04.711
I thought I could work for you,
but I can't.

37:04.751 --> 37:09.245
I do want to be successful,
just not by hurting people.

37:11.458 --> 37:13.790
I really misjudged you, Betty.

37:13.861 --> 37:16.761
Under those gaping pores
and caveman eyebrows,

37:16.829 --> 37:19.059
I thought you were smart.

37:19.131 --> 37:22.396
You think life is all about who's right
and who's wrong,

37:22.468 --> 37:27.838
but history is written by those who win,
not by those who are the nicest.

37:29.475 --> 37:31.272
Enjoy your party.

37:33.246 --> 37:36.214
Betty, why don't you stay?

37:37.148 --> 37:40.345
This party is about
to get very interesting.

38:00.404 --> 38:02.531
<i>Hello?
- Hey, Tony.</i>

38:02.573 --> 38:04.200
Are you here yet?
Because I don't see you.

38:04.241 --> 38:06.732
<i>Hey, Bobby,
sorry I didn't call you back.</i>

38:06.810 --> 38:09.108
<i>I had a family thing come up.</i>

38:10.748 --> 38:13.546
She didn't go out of town?
You're not coming?

38:13.617 --> 38:17.053
<i>Yeah, that's right.
Can I follow up with you tomorrow?</i>

38:17.687 --> 38:18.779
Is she there with you now?

38:18.855 --> 38:22.154
<i>Sure, sounds good.
All right, we'll talk tomorrow.</i>

38:30.466 --> 38:33.731
Honestly, Alexis, if this is about
a bunch of ridiculous letters,

38:33.803 --> 38:36.567
- I can assure you...
- This isn't just about the letters.

38:36.639 --> 38:42.235
I'm not happy with the magazine.
I think your cover is cold.

38:42.311 --> 38:47.044
Well, I had a very specific vision.
I didn't expect you to understand it.

38:47.149 --> 38:50.414
Well, I guess it was lost
on a few other people, too.

38:50.485 --> 38:52.783
Your first-day sales numbers are in.

38:52.854 --> 38:55.186
And they're not good.

38:55.257 --> 38:56.485
Impossible!

38:56.558 --> 38:59.890
<i>Your re-launch of Mode
is our lowest-selling issue in months.</i>

39:00.027 --> 39:02.860
While you're valued here
as our creative director,

39:02.897 --> 39:06.663
I've made a decision.
If you'll excuse me.

39:06.701 --> 39:10.262
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I can have your attention...

39:10.338 --> 39:13.501
I'm happy to announce that,
tonight, we are welcoming back,

39:13.574 --> 39:17.670
<i>as Editor-in-Chief of Mode magazine,
Daniel Meade!</i>

39:30.957 --> 39:32.219
Betty.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.793
Marc.

39:34.861 --> 39:38.456
Well, here we are,
as if nothing's changed.

39:39.499 --> 39:41.966
You left those letters for me,
didn't you?

39:42.034 --> 39:45.162
You planned this whole thing
so that I would be back with Daniel

39:45.237 --> 39:48.365
and you could have Wilhelmina
all to yourself.

39:48.440 --> 39:50.305
Don't be absurd.

39:50.409 --> 39:54.038
I would never do anything
to hurt Wilhelmina's interests,

39:55.447 --> 39:57.813
unless they're hurting mine.

40:02.253 --> 40:04.312
Don't forget,
I still own a third of this company.

40:04.389 --> 40:08.655
Your unborn child owns
a third of this company, not you!

40:08.726 --> 40:11.354
You would be nothing
without that baby.

40:11.429 --> 40:13.795
But don't worry,
you're still our creative director.

40:13.865 --> 40:16.993
Yeah, I'm more than happy
to have you come work for me.

40:17.068 --> 40:19.593
You can't push me aside.

40:19.670 --> 40:20.932
Really?

40:34.217 --> 40:36.811
You are gonna regret this, I swear.

40:36.887 --> 40:41.051
Don't you ever threaten
my children, Wilhelmina.

40:43.359 --> 40:47.455
You have no idea the lengths
I will go to protect them.

41:03.145 --> 41:04.873
- Daniel, I'm sorry...
- Betty, I never wanted you to leave.

41:04.946 --> 41:06.413
...I would ever even consider
working for that...

41:06.481 --> 41:09.644
Me first. Please.

41:09.717 --> 41:13.483
Thank you for having faith in me.

41:14.856 --> 41:17.188
That's what friends are for.

41:19.661 --> 41:21.424
You're coming back, right?

41:21.496 --> 41:25.556
Well, that depends on whether or not

41:25.632 --> 41:28.567
I can keep the raise
Wilhelmina gave me.

41:28.635 --> 41:32.002
Wow, wow. Talk about
using your moment of leverage.

41:32.106 --> 41:34.939
It's good to have you back, Daniel.

41:35.008 --> 41:36.839
It's good to be back.

41:38.412 --> 41:41.711
Now seriously, about the raise,
you know, once you go there,

41:41.782 --> 41:43.807
- you can't really go back.
- Really?
