00:18.560 --> 00:21.723
Six months ago, US Special
Forces launched an assault

00:21.813 --> 00:23.724
<i>on the compound of
Ibrahim Bin-Khalid,</i>

00:23.815 --> 00:26.352
<i>killing him and eight members
of his terrorist organization.</i>

00:29.363 --> 00:30.649
Bin-Khalid's people found us.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.609
Where is it?

00:32.698 --> 00:35.111
<i>The strongbox that belongs
to Sheik Bin Khalid</i>

00:35.619 --> 00:37.030
taken from his
compound the night

00:37.162 --> 00:38.573
your squad came
and killed him.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.574
Carter?

00:43.710 --> 00:44.791
We're blown. The whole squad.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.209
<i>Grimes and I are
the only ones left.</i>

00:47.673 --> 00:49.209
Three people had
access to our new names.

00:49.299 --> 00:53.384
The Directors of CIA, NSA and
CTU, which is now Keith Mullins.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.757
You're the one who chose me,
as your replacement.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.504
You need to trust
me to do the job.

00:57.641 --> 00:58.631
Rebecca, what is this?

01:01.645 --> 01:04.102
<i>Is Rebecca having second thoughts
about giving up her career?</i>

01:04.272 --> 01:05.638
You're gonna make
a great First Lady.

01:07.651 --> 01:08.641
Maybe part of her
doesn't want you

01:08.735 --> 01:09.850
to win and have
everything change.

01:10.654 --> 01:11.644
You're overstepping.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.029
I think Amira's
gonna do something.

01:14.116 --> 01:16.608
Bad,
violent, here at the school.

01:16.827 --> 01:17.817
Drew saw our messages.

01:17.995 --> 01:18.985
What?

01:20.539 --> 01:23.156
He thinks you're planning an
attack at the school with someone.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.411
He doesn't know it's with me.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.166
What are we doing here?

01:26.295 --> 01:27.330
I'm getting you safe.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.246
Isaac's not on anyone's books.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.752
He's got guns. He's got men.
He can protect you.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.299
You think because
he's your brother

01:34.428 --> 01:35.839
he's just gonna
forget what happened?

01:37.222 --> 01:38.758
There is
something inside that box

01:38.890 --> 01:40.221
and they're after us,
so where is it?

01:41.977 --> 01:43.012
What is it?

01:43.145 --> 01:44.476
It's a list. Sleeper cells.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.520
These codes go out. They launch
attacks all over the country.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.648
Where's the chip?
Government wants this list,

01:53.739 --> 01:54.774
they're gonna have to pay up.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.355
Please don't do this. Ben?

01:59.411 --> 02:05.202
(ERIC READING)

02:30.525 --> 02:31.981
Rebecca, it's Carter.

02:32.736 --> 02:33.976
Ben got away.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.186
Please tell me
you're still tracking him.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.146
We were. He left the
construction site, heading east,

02:37.240 --> 02:38.571
but we lost him on 13th.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.776
I found out why Bin-Khalid's
people wanted the strongbox.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.070
Inside,
there was a flash drive

02:45.248 --> 02:46.454
containing a list
of sleeper cells

02:46.541 --> 02:47.952
that Bin-Khalid set up here,

02:48.335 --> 02:50.042
along with all the codes
to trigger their attacks.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.504
It looked like 15,
maybe 20 cells,

02:53.632 --> 02:55.168
but I didn't have
the list for very long.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.291
He said he'll sell
it to the terrorists

02:57.427 --> 02:58.667
if we don't give
him what he wants.

02:58.762 --> 02:59.923
I'm still waiting to
find out what that is.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.424
Do you believe
he'd really do that?

03:02.057 --> 03:04.674
He's angry, and he's unstable.
I do.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.433
We'll keep
looking for him here.

03:06.603 --> 03:07.889
Let us know if
he makes contact.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.720
ERIC: <i>Yeah, I'm headed over
to 13th.</i>

03:15.195 --> 03:16.435
Keep looking for Grimes.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.986
I'm going to talk to Keith.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.962
Rebeooa, what the hell is going on?
Have you lost your mind?

03:36.216 --> 03:37.206
Keith, listen to me.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.377
No, let me out of here, now!

03:38.593 --> 03:39.708
I can't do that.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.006
Not until I know
if I can trust you.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.046
Trust me?

03:44.141 --> 03:46.223
Because I'm the one who's acted
completely out cf bounds?

03:47.102 --> 03:50.140
The Ranger squad that killed
Bin-Khalid was attacked this morning.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.646
Four of them were murdered,
and their families.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.392
But...

03:56.486 --> 03:57.601
The Rangers were living
under new identities

03:57.696 --> 03:59.687
that only three
people had access to,

04:00.282 --> 04:04.651
the directors of CIA,
NSA and you.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.074
And you think I gave them up?

04:08.707 --> 04:10.163
No. I don't.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.158
But I have to be sure.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.619
I wanna clear you,
but I need your help.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.163
H ow?

04:17.507 --> 04:19.373
I wanna get into
the CTU's subnetwork.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.084
To find out who accessed
the Rangers' files.

04:22.179 --> 04:25.171
To do that, I need
your director's override.

04:25.891 --> 04:26.881
My override?

04:27.017 --> 04:28.007
Once I identify the leak,

04:28.101 --> 04:29.808
I can track them backto
the people behind this.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.681
Keith, killing the Rangers
is only the beginning.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.774
These people are planning
attacks against this country.

04:39.905 --> 04:42.192
I have no way of verifying
what you're telling me,

04:42.324 --> 04:44.281
but, what,
I'm supposed to give you

04:44.409 --> 04:46.195
unfettered
access to the system?

04:47.037 --> 04:48.368
Why would I make all this up?

04:49.331 --> 04:51.163
Do you really think I
wanna be doing this?

04:52.709 --> 04:54.040
I'm supposed to
be with my husband,

04:54.169 --> 04:55.455
Keith, helping him
with his campaign.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.082
Now, give me the damned override
so I can get you out of here

04:58.173 --> 04:59.709
and get back to my life.

05:02.761 --> 05:05.298
The override key is in the
personal safe behind my desk.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.755

did you see which way he went?

05:54.437 --> 05:55.768
Where did you serve, man?

05:56.940 --> 06:00.274
I was in Afghanistan,
Yemen, 75th Infantry.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.276
"Rangers lead the way."

06:03.446 --> 06:04.732
That's right.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.777
The man you're looking for
ran towards that fence,

06:08.493 --> 06:09.608
near the railroad tracks.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.614
Thank you. Thank you.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.058
Mullins' override got me
into the subsystem,

06:35.145 --> 06:36.601
but I still need
to parse the locks.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.645
Andy, will you be able
to find the leak or not?

06:38.940 --> 06:40.476
Yes, but I don't know
how long it will take.

any cameras down there.

he can't know you're on, okay?

Understood. Andy, run a trace.

Ben, talk to me, man.

Not enough for what I've been through,
but it's the most I can carry.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.018
Ben, you know I can't ask the
government for that kind of money.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.469
This is not
an official operation.

07:19.689 --> 07:20.770
It's not my problem.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.689
You get me the money,
or I'll call Bin-Khalid's men.

at the construction site.

listen, you're strung out,

07:26.112 --> 07:27.602

thinking straight.

Eric, I've never been
more clear in my life.

Show up at the 7th Street metro
station with my money in one hour.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.199
An hour... Ben, you gotta
give me more time.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.870
For the government to find me?

07:38.291 --> 07:41.158
No, you show up on-time with
the money, you get the list.

things don't happen, Eric,</i>

07:43.213 --> 07:45.124

there's no way I can get my

07:50.553 --> 07:52.043
hands on that
much cash in an hour.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.503
Not as a private citizen.

07:53.598 --> 07:54.679
There's nobody
in the government you can ask?

07:55.308 --> 07:56.719
No one who'd
even entertain it.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.050
And in any case, the request
would go into the system

07:59.145 --> 08:00.135
and alert the leak.

Is there anyone else you know
who might have the money?

Well, ain't nobody

No.

We have men and weapons.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.080
We move now, pick a target,
and launch our own attack.

11:49.167 --> 11:52.034
We're here to finish
what my father started.

11:53.463 --> 11:56.797
I respect you as his son, but
you are not a soldier like him.

11:58.635 --> 11:59.796
Your father fought
the enemy from caves

12:00.303 --> 12:01.793
while you were
studying at Oxford.

12:02.096 --> 12:03.336
But I'm here now.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.052
Like my father always wanted.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.849
You've told me you loved
my father like a brother.

and launch the sleeper cells.

Hey-

12:42.011 --> 12:44.093
Mr. Harris called
me into his office.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.218
He wanted to talk to me before
he went to the principal.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.679
I had to tell him about the text, okay?
I had no choice!

12:49.852 --> 12:50.887
It's not what you think.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.852
Amira, you were planning
an attack at the school.

12:52.981 --> 12:56.349
Please. Please, Drew.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.270
Let me at least
try to explain.

13:03.366 --> 13:04.856
After we broke up,

13:06.661 --> 13:07.947
I was lonely.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.780
I went online, started talking
to this guy from back home,

13:12.542 --> 13:13.703
a friend.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.913
But he didn't
like this country.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.253
I started saying
that stuff because I

13:18.381 --> 13:19.871
thought it was what
he wanted to hear.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.127
Just to keep
talking to someone.

13:22.844 --> 13:24.255
But it wasn't real.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.550
Not for me, Drew.
Never for me.

13:28.391 --> 13:29.973
None of it?
No.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.717
Please, Drew, you know me.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.020
And you told all of
this to Mr. Harris?

13:35.982 --> 13:36.972
Yes.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.682
And I showed him all
the texts from Kasim

13:38.776 --> 13:40.733
where I'm telling him
never to contact me again.

13:41.404 --> 13:42.690
I thought what he was
talking about was crazy.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.111
So, what is Mr.
Harris gonna do?

13:46.075 --> 13:48.863
He say he'll tell the principal
that he believes me.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.244
That we see what
happens from there.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.206
I'm sorry.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.125
It's okay.

14:03.426 --> 14:06.134
I know you only did this
because you care for me.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.842
And it's made me realize

14:13.227 --> 14:14.683
that I feel the same way.

14:25.740 --> 14:26.946
Can we talk later?

14:27.367 --> 14:28.823

someone from Chechnya,

14:52.892 --> 14:54.053
that it was over.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.802
That I explained everything
to you and you believed it.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.603
Did Drew believe it?

15:00.566 --> 15:01.772
I think so, yes.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.064
What if he told someone else?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.191
I think we should
wait until we're sure.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.866
You need to finish
mixing that explosive.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.699

activated at any time.

never get out of there alive.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.218
Just tell me if the money's at
the police station, Rebecca.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.891
Your source is right.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.473
Metro PD made a drug bust
in Southeast, DC.

15:39.564 --> 15:41.646
Recovered a little
over 4.6 million in cash.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.932
Can you tell me where the
evidence lockers are?

15:44.235 --> 15:45.521
Yes, first floor,
next to Dispatch.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.444

by two surveillance cameras.

put them in a loop.

Before you do anything,
give us some

15:56.539 --> 15:57.995

can find the leak.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.660
How long is that gonna take?

16:00.626 --> 16:02.116
Twenty minutes, 30 tops.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.627
No, no. It's too long, okay?

16:04.714 --> 16:07.126
Grimes is expecting this money
in half an hour.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.048
Then we'll
bring CTU into this.

it, brought it to you,

16:31.282 --> 16:32.443
but I covered for him.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.445
I tried to get
his head straight.

16:35.661 --> 16:36.822
We all missed it.

16:36.913 --> 16:39.951
Now my men are dead
because of Grimes.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.493
And now he has the list.

people get killed...

her sophomore year.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.779
Show me.

25:14.555 --> 25:15.636
This doesn't make sense.

25:15.764 --> 25:16.925
She was young.

25:17.391 --> 25:18.597
Yeah, still...

25:19.810 --> 25:21.892
Well, son, I don't know
what else to tell you,

25:21.979 --> 25:23.390
except, she's a liability.

25:26.817 --> 25:30.276
John, bottom line is
you will not win in November

25:31.030 --> 25:32.862
if you have a campaign manager

25:32.948 --> 25:35.155
who prayed for the death
of American soldiers.

25:57.931 --> 26:01.720
The North Pines Mall, crowded,
five miles from here.

Minimal security.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.393
JADALLAI What is this, Kusuma?

26:07.524 --> 26:10.232
We can still do what we came here to do.
Strike back at this country.

26:10.778 --> 26:12.064
I've chosen a target.

26:12.821 --> 26:14.437
One attack won't
change history.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.864
Activating my
father's network will.

26:18.452 --> 26:20.489
We are not going to stay and wait
for the Americans to find us.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.995
If we don't act now,
we'll achieve nothing.

26:24.166 --> 26:25.201
You're coming with us.

26:25.292 --> 26:26.453
I'm not going anywhere.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.584
And neither are you.

Only God will
decide when I die.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.167
Now, put your gun away.
We have work to do.

27:25.769 --> 27:26.975
You shouldn't be here.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.144
Yeah, well, you hung up on me. I
was worried. (GLASS BREAKING)

27:36.572 --> 27:39.860

27:41.660 --> 27:42.741
Look at me.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.236
You need to finish
mixing the explosives.

27:47.124 --> 27:48.956
Have you forgotten
what these people did to you?

27:50.252 --> 27:52.334
What they said about you
with those other students?

27:52.963 --> 27:54.294
Have you?

27:54.756 --> 27:55.962
No.

27:59.761 --> 28:00.967
They destroyed your marriage.

28:01.889 --> 28:04.051
And now, they're trying
to destroy your career.

28:10.814 --> 28:13.897
No. Amira, please stop.

you were texting?

31:13.080 --> 31:14.286

walk away from this. Sit down.

available to the press,

33:20.624 --> 33:22.740

just refer them to me.

Can you excuse
us for a moment?

33:38.767 --> 33:41.680
Gage's campaign is releasing
an attack ad tomorrow

33:43.271 --> 33:44.432
about you.

33:46.775 --> 33:48.982
About you attending
the Parkland Mosque.

33:52.614 --> 33:54.230
The Parkland Mosque?

33:59.621 --> 34:01.237
I didn't go there to pray.

34:03.416 --> 34:05.953
It made me sick that some
crackpot imam was spewing

34:06.044 --> 34:08.627
that kind of hatred and
violence in the name of Islam.

34:10.005 --> 34:12.121
I went to tell everyone there
he was distorting our religion.

34:15.303 --> 34:16.714
And you can prove that?

34:18.764 --> 34:20.880
Even if I could,
the damage is done.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.634
But it is the truth.

34:26.982 --> 34:28.848
I wanted to tell you. I did.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.853
I guess I just convinced myself
it happened so long ago,

34:31.945 --> 34:33.310
no one would ever find out.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.281
I'm sorry.

34:40.579 --> 34:44.038
I will draft my letter of
resignation and explain how...

34:44.123 --> 34:45.739
I won't accept
your resignation.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.159
It's true,
you should've told me.

34:51.297 --> 34:53.710
But it's also true that I wouldn't
be here if it weren't for you.

34:55.844 --> 34:58.302
As much as I appreciate your
loyalty, I can't let you do this.

34:58.388 --> 35:01.471
If we get ahead of this,
we can minimize the damage.

35:03.310 --> 35:05.517
Who knows, maybe even turn it
into an advantage.

35:06.730 --> 35:08.687
Gage will just keep playing
the national security card.

35:09.357 --> 35:10.768
Rebecca could
help us out there.

35:11.943 --> 35:12.978
You'll still take a hit.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.192
Well, the hit I can take.

35:15.030 --> 35:16.612
It's not swinging back,
that's what bothers me.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.399
Standing up for the truth,
the way you did,

35:21.703 --> 35:23.034
it's what I've
been telling the

35:23.204 --> 35:24.535
American people I'm
gonna do for them.

35:24.623 --> 35:25.829
That's why I'm in this.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.537
John,
I don't know what to say.

35:29.669 --> 35:31.205
Just stop trying to
argue yourself out of a job.

35:50.857 --> 35:52.188
What's up?

35:52.400 --> 35:54.437
Royo, it's me, Aisha.

35:57.113 --> 35:58.319
It's about the deal.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.447
Isaac ain't gonna
bitch out, is he?

36:00.533 --> 36:01.864
You said this was happening.

36:02.786 --> 36:04.902
He's still in, but listen up.

36:05.538 --> 36:07.779
I know you ain't down with
the split, never have been.

36:08.458 --> 36:09.914
Maybe I can do better.

36:10.585 --> 36:11.620
<i>You'?</i>

36:11.753 --> 36:13.289
Money ain't
coming in like it was.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.746
That's why I reached out
to you in the first place,

36:16.091 --> 36:17.547
put this deal together.

36:19.636 --> 36:21.593
If Isaac don't make it
back from this meeting,

36:23.098 --> 36:24.930
wouldn't be a lot of tears.

36:34.693 --> 36:35.854
You still there?

36:36.236 --> 36:37.397
I'm here.

36:37.779 --> 36:39.235
Well, I'm still listening.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.113
Good.

37:07.308 --> 37:08.798
Okay, he's got it.

to Head of Field Ops.</i>

37:17.318 --> 37:19.810
He has a debrief
scheduled with Mullins.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.195
You'll have to stall him.
Me?

37:22.699 --> 37:24.485
I don't work here anymore, Andy.
It has to be you.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.240
You can do this.

37:34.669 --> 37:36.330
Hey, Tom.
What's up?

37:36.421 --> 37:37.877
Keith asked me to
tell you to submit

37:38.006 --> 37:39.462
your debrief in
writing this time.

37:39.549 --> 37:40.835
He always
debriefs me in person.

37:41.134 --> 37:42.795
Yeah, but he and Rebecca are
still going over case files.

37:42.886 --> 37:44.672

longer thantheythought

37:45.472 --> 37:46.507
Okay, thanks.

37:46.639 --> 37:49.677
Tom? I texted you.

37:50.560 --> 37:53.427
About getting together to,
maybe, you know, clear the air.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.762
There's no air
that needs clearing.

37:57.192 --> 37:58.853
We have nothing to
talk about, Andy.

38:13.374 --> 38:15.365
Agent Locke, can I
talk to you for a second?

38:16.586 --> 38:17.872
Sorry, who are you again?

I don't think Andy told you

38:23.718 --> 38:25.334
the truth about
Director Mullins.

38:26.554 --> 38:27.919
What are you talking about?

38:29.140 --> 38:31.256
Something really
weird is going on.

38:31.351 --> 38:33.888
