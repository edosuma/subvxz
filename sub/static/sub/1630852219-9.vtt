00:46.800 --> 00:53.120
So this is how it is.
You're the brain behind Blue Blood.

00:56.640 --> 01:00.880
- Enzo doesn't need my brain.
- But he does need your drugs.

01:04.160 --> 01:07.640
We are the founders of the Camorra.

01:07.760 --> 01:10.400
And then someone from Secondigliano

01:10.560 --> 01:12.560
wants to steal our place?

01:14.040 --> 01:17.880
First, I'm no longer
someone from Secondigliano.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.240
Second, we've already
taken all your places.

01:24.840 --> 01:28.640
If you're no longer from
Secondigliano, who are you then?

01:31.800 --> 01:35.720
Someone who wants to do business
with justice.

01:35.840 --> 01:38.320
What justice do you mean?

01:42.640 --> 01:46.960
You took away Santo's business.

01:47.080 --> 01:51.600
If you don't want any more bodies,
give Blue Blood back his place.

01:51.720 --> 01:55.360
We didn't steal anything.
Santo went to the police.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.880
We cannot support his family,
everybody knows them.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.960
But you also have turncoats
at home now, right?

02:09.120 --> 02:13.120
So those stupid rules no longer apply.

02:27.840 --> 02:33.120
And what happens if everything goes
like you're saying now?

02:35.120 --> 02:40.640
Then you accept that Blue Blood
is entitled to this, and you aren't.

03:00.200 --> 03:04.200
Translated by: NederSubs

03:30.080 --> 03:33.760
You swore to me
that asshole didn't exist to you anymore.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.120
He doesn't, Dad. You know that.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.400
That's what I thought.

03:46.040 --> 03:47.880
Because you gave me that impression.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.000
But now I know that's not true.

03:53.120 --> 03:57.400
His father is dead.
The sooner he realizes that,

03:57.520 --> 03:59.640
the better it is for everyone.

04:01.840 --> 04:05.480
But Dad, it's not like you think.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.400
- Sweetheart.
- Gennaro.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.760
- How are you?
- Not good.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.600
He knows everything.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.040
- Are you sure?
- Yes, very sure.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.400
Tell me.

04:43.960 --> 04:48.280
The other day, you said he was a problem
that needed to be resolved.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.880
Resolve it quickly.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.680
The Wizard said yes.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.120
This is a drop in the ocean.

05:52.680 --> 05:56.320
If you want to see your son grow up,
you have to act smart.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.040
To achieve what you want to achieve,
time is needed.

06:02.240 --> 06:06.880
Time is not a problem for you.
For me it is.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.960
I'm ready to share all of Maddalena
with you.

07:23.560 --> 07:27.280
But you have to give him Forcella.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.320
Ruggero.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.800
We have no choice, Edoardo.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.720
We either give in or wage war.

07:46.840 --> 07:51.240
And a real war will cost us a lot more.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.520
Forcella is ours.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.640
With all due respect,
Ciro pushed us into the System.

08:18.760 --> 08:23.200
- And? Is that so bad?
- We've always hated the System.

08:23.320 --> 08:28.520
I'm not that arrogant.
I think the System is a good thing.

08:31.920 --> 08:36.039
This is all thanks to Ciro. He taught us
everything and gave us weapons.

08:36.159 --> 08:37.919
Do you realize that?

08:40.799 --> 08:44.280
I gave him my word.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.920
We wanted our neighborhood back
and now we're going to claim it.

09:29.640 --> 09:32.080
Take this one, and stay sharp.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.200
And the last one. Have a nice day.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.920
Are we going downstairs, to Uncle Enzo?

11:11.280 --> 11:14.600
Why would you?
You can see everything from here.

11:14.720 --> 11:17.320
- Yes, but...
- Blue Blood.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.400
- I'll be right there.
- Hurry up, okay?

12:59.680 --> 13:01.880
- Hi, Carmela.
- Hi.

13:08.360 --> 13:09.760
You did it.

13:11.840 --> 13:15.600
You've taken everything
what Dad couldn't get.

13:15.720 --> 13:18.640
Now the whole neighborhood loves you,
did you see that?

13:18.760 --> 13:20.720
But nobody is untouchable.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.400
And now, you have to be
even more aware of that.

13:26.520 --> 13:29.960
- What do you mean?
- You think you're Santo now.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.640
But the world has changed.

13:32.760 --> 13:37.160
In the past, you showed respect
and kept your word.

13:37.280 --> 13:42.480
But now everyone betrays each other,
even your brother can rat you out.

13:42.600 --> 13:47.720
- That's not how my friends are.
- No, but you have to stay alert.

13:47.840 --> 13:51.120
Are you on my side?

13:51.240 --> 13:56.320
I am on your side.
But you have to promise me one thing.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.400
Keep Cosimino out of it.

14:02.840 --> 14:08.920
The first one who puts him
onto the streets, I'll kill them.

14:13.400 --> 14:16.080
Good night, Blue Blood.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.640
Are you coming with me?

15:04.280 --> 15:06.600
Then we buy new shoes for you.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.040
- What's the matter?
- All the boys are allowed to help.

15:16.160 --> 15:20.200
But not me. They all say
that my uncle says I can't.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.480
In this life,
you either end up dead or in jail.

15:25.520 --> 15:28.720
I'm like my uncle, I'm not afraid to die.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.280
Listen carefully.

15:34.400 --> 15:40.920
Dying sucks. You'll start to shake,
you can't breathe, you'll piss yourself.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.400
Besides, it's a waste.

15:43.520 --> 15:47.280
You're proud of him now.
I want you to be proud of me too.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.640
He did this to take back what was ours.

15:50.760 --> 15:53.200
And he did it for you.

15:53.320 --> 15:58.400
So that you can get out of here
and live a life different than ours.

15:58.520 --> 16:01.400
Then, your uncle and I
will be real proud of you.

16:04.360 --> 16:05.960
Are you coming now?

16:07.840 --> 16:11.880
Fine.
Behave yourself, I'll see you in a bit.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.840
And make sure your phone is on.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.600
- Hello, can I try this on?
- Yes, the fitting rooms are on the right.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.240
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

17:04.880 --> 17:06.640
Let's go.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.359
Wait a minute, guys.

17:14.480 --> 17:18.280
- Hello, how are you?
- What is it?

17:18.400 --> 17:22.319
- Are you still at home? Done your homework?
- Yes.

17:22.400 --> 17:26.680
Do you want to see the dress
I bought for that dinner at your uncle's?

17:26.800 --> 17:29.600
- I'll send you a picture.
- Hurry up.

17:29.720 --> 17:32.200
Where are you now?

17:37.840 --> 17:40.920
What's the matter? What happened?

17:41.040 --> 17:43.640
Is everything okay?

17:53.400 --> 17:57.360
Hello Bell'e Buon.

17:57.480 --> 17:58.880
What?

20:33.320 --> 20:38.200
The others are behind you,
but responding now is suicide, they say.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.760
Do you think so, too?

20:49.600 --> 20:51.400
What are you going to do?

20:54.120 --> 20:57.240
I'll stay with you,
even if it will kill me.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.640
Peace is over.

21:20.760 --> 21:26.400
I can only tell you that the order
didn't come from me, nor from my allies.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.680
We're looking for the person responsible,
but that will take time.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.880
We don't have time.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.240
I give you my word. I'll find out
who it was and bring them to you.

21:38.040 --> 21:42.840
It wasn't easy to persuade my allies
to give you Forcella.

21:42.960 --> 21:50.400
They're angry now. And if Blue Blood
does something, I won't stop them.

21:50.560 --> 21:54.880
Think about it and make a decision.

22:20.160 --> 22:26.000
Do you really think that monkey
will try its best to stop Blue Blood?

22:26.120 --> 22:29.160
Ciro di Marzio is anything but a monkey.

22:30.640 --> 22:34.600
I'm okay with everything, you know that.
You're in charge.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.400
But I do have a question for you:

22:42.600 --> 22:44.680
If it weren't us...

22:46.200 --> 22:48.360
who was it then?

23:13.600 --> 23:15.120
I'm really sorry for you.

23:22.920 --> 23:28.760
I already talked to them. As soon as they
find the culprit, they bring them to us.

23:34.920 --> 23:39.520
- It was that asshole Charming.
- We can't know that.

23:41.200 --> 23:44.400
The Wizard says
they only need some time.

23:44.520 --> 23:47.920
We wiped them out.
Think about it...

23:48.040 --> 23:50.960
Who's chased out of Forcella
due to our agreement?

23:51.080 --> 23:55.920
And who will come back
if that agreement is terminated again?

23:56.040 --> 24:00.400
You're poisoned inside,
I understand that.

24:03.160 --> 24:07.840
But before you do anything,
you have to think.

24:07.960 --> 24:12.200
Nobody has to tell me what to do.
I already know that.

24:54.640 --> 24:57.840
Manuela wants to tell you
something important.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.800
Tell him.

25:18.960 --> 25:23.160
The daughter of a friend
is a schoolmate of Charming's niece.

25:23.280 --> 25:27.040
She says they're celebrating the communion
on Saturday, in Marechiaro.

25:42.200 --> 25:47.080
- No, I didn't do it for the money.
- This is for Carmela's smile.

25:47.200 --> 25:53.000
Your sister was an angel.
She's asking for justice from heaven.

26:30.040 --> 26:33.400
I already talked to the Wizard.

26:33.560 --> 26:36.480
He says the Federation
is not behind this.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.000
I believe him.

26:39.120 --> 26:43.480
Otherwise they would never have
pulled back their boys from Forcella.

26:43.600 --> 26:47.520
In addition, they would never
hurt Carmela. They knew it.

26:47.640 --> 26:51.880
That was the only thing
Enzo would flip out about.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.120
It was you.

26:54.240 --> 26:58.240
What did you say, again? You didn't
trust yourself, but you trusted me.

26:59.760 --> 27:04.080
You killed the sister of our ally,
that wasn't the deal.

27:04.200 --> 27:09.160
You should've talked to me, and I should've
talked to Enzo. Why didn't you do that?

27:15.680 --> 27:21.000
That time is over,
now I have to regain my family.

27:27.600 --> 27:31.000
Who's your brother, me or Enzo?

27:31.120 --> 27:33.200
I want to know whose side you're on.

27:37.320 --> 27:41.240
I've already made my choice.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.480
I will not change my mind.

27:46.880 --> 27:49.600
Enzo thinks Charming is behind it.

27:52.200 --> 27:55.960
And he can keep thinking that.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.120
They're coming.

30:52.840 --> 30:54.960
It's crawling with armed men.

33:32.680 --> 33:35.160
- Will this stay between us?
- You know me.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.680
Don't you dare.

33:40.360 --> 33:41.760
Quick.

33:47.520 --> 33:50.600
You fucked up real bad.

33:50.720 --> 33:54.200
I don't want to talk about that now.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.640
What do you mean,
do I need to keep my mouth shut?

33:58.760 --> 34:02.760
If someone has to keep their mouth shut,
it's you. Shut the fuck up.

34:02.880 --> 34:05.320
You think you're tough or what?

34:05.400 --> 34:10.080
I've seen what you're capable of.
You better back off.

34:10.199 --> 34:14.239
If you want to do something again,
you ask me for permission.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.159
Wait for him here.

34:47.920 --> 34:51.480
- Search him, make sure you find him.
- Will do.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.400
Who's there?

35:00.800 --> 35:05.320
- A woman wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?

35:05.400 --> 35:08.840
I don't know her,
but she's alone and unarmed.

35:08.960 --> 35:12.040
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

35:14.720 --> 35:17.040
Wait here, don't worry.

35:29.600 --> 35:33.680
- Good evening. Have a seat.
- Thank you.

35:38.040 --> 35:42.320
Now that I see you in person,
I get why they call you Charming.

35:42.400 --> 35:46.360
Compliments from beautiful women
are always nice.

35:46.480 --> 35:50.120
Although I think it's a shame
that I don't know who you are.

35:52.480 --> 35:57.280
Annalisa Magliocca,
but my name is not important.

35:57.400 --> 36:01.160
This is about the name
of the asshole behind Blue Blood.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.800
Do you mean Ciro di Marzio?

36:10.240 --> 36:12.400
I mean Genny Savastano.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.800
You could have killed him,
but you didn't.

36:24.920 --> 36:31.520
And now he's back firmly on his feet,
thinking about how he can screw you over.

36:31.640 --> 36:38.560
That's why I'm here. I thought
this information might be important.

36:39.600 --> 36:43.320
Did I think that correctly?

36:43.400 --> 36:48.160
If yes, this can be the beginning
of a great friendship.

36:48.280 --> 36:52.240
And as you know,
my friends are close to my heart.

36:54.400 --> 36:58.200
I was hoping to hear that.

36:58.320 --> 37:01.160
- May I go, Don Edoardo?
- Sure, go.

37:31.760 --> 37:34.040
It's me, I want to see you.

37:57.800 --> 37:59.640
Do you have it?

37:59.760 --> 38:01.200
Then we'll go.

38:45.640 --> 38:48.440
NEXT TIME
