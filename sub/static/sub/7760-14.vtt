SUCH A MAGICAL KINGDOM,

01:26.220 --> 01:28.522
FULL OF SPRITES AND FAIRIES.

01:28.556 --> 01:31.859
NOW IT'S LIKE WATCHING
THE WIZARD OF OZ IN REVERSE.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.861
COPS IN THE STREETS,
COPS IN THE BARS,

01:33.894 --> 01:35.363
COPS IN THE CLUBS.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.864
IT'S FUCKING DEPRESSING.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.813
WE'RE COP-ULATING.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.383
- THIS IS NO LAUGHING MATTER.
COME ON.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.651
- THIS STREET'S A SHADOW
OF ITS FORMER SELF.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.521
STOP STOCKWELL.

02:00.554 --> 02:01.755
- I THINK HE'S HOT.

02:01.789 --> 02:05.393
- I'D DO HIM ANY DAY.
- [chuckles]

02:05.426 --> 02:07.828
- JESUS, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO
TO GET THROUGH TO THESE GUYS--

02:07.861 --> 02:10.364
SHOVE UP A STICK OF DYNAMITE
UP THEIR COLLECTIVE ASS,

02:10.398 --> 02:11.765
HOLLER "BLOODY MURDER"?

- THANKS.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.670

- YOU WANT TO LEND A HAND?
- STOP STOCKWELL.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.242
- IT'S GOING TO TAKE
MORE THAN THAT.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.510
- STOP STOCKWELL.

02:22.543 --> 02:25.313

- SO, LISTEN,
I'VE GOT CLASSES TILL 5:00.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.263
- COMING HOME AFTER SCHOOL?

02:42.296 --> 02:43.697
- FIRST I'VE GOT
BAND PRACTICE,

02:43.731 --> 02:46.267
AND THEN SUZY AND I ARE STUDYING
FOR THE CHEM FINAL.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.735

02:47.768 --> 02:49.437
- CAN'T YOU TELL
HE'S BULLSHITTING US?

02:49.470 --> 02:50.838
- SURE.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.673
SO WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

02:52.706 --> 02:55.543
- TO HANG WITH MY FRIENDS,
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.545
I TOLD THEM I'M LIVING
WITH TWO OLD QUEENS

02:57.578 --> 03:00.648
WHO PAY ME FIVE "C"s A DAY
TO WALK AROUND NAKED.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.949
- ALWAYS BULLSHITTING US.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.818
- ACTUALLY, THAT'S THE TRUTH.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.355
THEY'RE JEALOUS AS HELL,
THINKING I GOT THIS CUSHY GIG,

03:07.388 --> 03:09.290
WHILE THEY'RE OUT TRYING
TO ROLL A STOCKBROKER

03:09.323 --> 03:10.724
FOR LUNCH MONEY.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.293
- YEAH, WELL...

03:12.326 --> 03:14.828
TRY AND REMEMBER,
DINNER'S AT 7:00.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.298
BEN'S MAKING HIS TOFU STIR-FRY.

03:25.806 --> 03:28.709
- AND IT'S SEXY AS HELL.

03:28.742 --> 03:32.980
- OH, YOU THINK SO?
- MM-HMM.

03:33.013 --> 03:35.583
YOU SAID I WAS SEXY
WHEN I WAS CARRYING GUS.

03:35.616 --> 03:36.850
- HMM.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.452
- OR WAS THAT
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER

03:38.486 --> 03:39.853
BECAUSE I LOOKED LIKE A WHALE?

03:39.887 --> 03:41.855
- THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT A PREGNANT WOMAN--

03:41.889 --> 03:43.457
THAT GLOW.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.859
- FOR ME,
THAT GLOW WAS NAUSEA.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.795
- HMM, ME TOO...

03:47.828 --> 03:51.299
AND YET I CRAVE PIZZA
WITH PEPPERONI AND PINEAPPLE.

03:54.635 --> 03:57.371
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I CALL
FAST DELIVERY.

03:57.405 --> 03:58.939
- SORRY.
IT'S NOT A PIZZA.

04:02.510 --> 04:03.944
IT'S A BLANKET FOR THE BABY.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.480
I GOT IT AT THIS ANTIQUE STORE
NEAR THE GALLERY.

04:06.514 --> 04:07.881
- YEAH, GET THIS OUT OF HERE.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.384
- HUH?
- PLEASE.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.019
- W-WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- DON'T YOU KNOW IT'S BAD LUCK

04:12.052 --> 04:13.654
TO BUY SOMETHING
FOR A BABY BEFORE IT'S BORN?

04:13.687 --> 04:15.656
- WELL, HOW WAS I TO KNOW
IT WAS A JEWISH CUSTOM?

04:15.689 --> 04:17.057
I'M JUST A POOR SHIKSA.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.293
- LOOK, I'M SORRY, BUT YOU HAVE
TO TAKE IT BACK.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.795
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, I'LL
RETURN IT ON MY WAY TO WORK.

04:21.829 --> 04:24.698
- EM, YOU'RE UP EARLY.

04:24.732 --> 04:27.368
- HMM, COULDN'T SLEEP,

04:27.401 --> 04:30.404
THOUGHT I'D COME DOWNSTAIRS,
PICK UP A BOOK.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.706
- "PSYCHOLOGY OF THE VAGINA"?

04:32.740 --> 04:35.976
- YEAH, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
ON MY MUST-READ LIST.

04:36.009 --> 04:38.446
[cell phone ringing]

04:38.479 --> 04:40.848
OH, THAT'S MINE.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.788
VIC, HI.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.657
YEAH, I'M, UM...

04:49.690 --> 04:51.058
[clears throat] I'M FEELING

04:51.091 --> 04:52.926
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD MEET
WITH THE, UH--

04:52.960 --> 04:54.662
THE HILLIARD-FORDE'S

04:54.695 --> 04:58.799
TO GO OVER THE PLANS FOR THEIR
WILD WEST ANNIVERSARY?

04:58.832 --> 05:00.968
THANKS EVER SO.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.406
THEY WANT TO RENEW
THEIR WEDDING VOWS...

05:05.439 --> 05:07.575
ON HORSEBACK.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.109
- EMMETT...

05:09.142 --> 05:11.412
SWEETIE, YOU CAN TELL ME

05:11.445 --> 05:14.415
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS
AND TO BUTT OUT...

05:14.448 --> 05:15.983
BUT IF TED
WANTS TO DESTROY HIMSELF,

05:16.016 --> 05:17.418
THAT'S HIS CHOICE.

05:17.451 --> 05:20.688
DON'T LET HIM DESTROY YOU TOO.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.090
- LINDSAY, SWEETIE...

05:23.123 --> 05:24.858
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS...

05:24.892 --> 05:27.828
SO BUTT OUT.

05:27.861 --> 05:30.498
[sighs]

05:30.531 --> 05:32.500
SORRY.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.001
IT'S JUST...

05:34.034 --> 05:36.103
HE'S MY PARTNER...

05:36.136 --> 05:38.839
YOU KNOW, MY PAL.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.041
IF ANYONE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT,
YOU TWO CAN.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.877
- YEAH, BUT STILL,
YOU GOT TO BE TOUGH.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.379
- TOUGH, HMM.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.748
THAT'S WHAT MY DADDY
USED TO SAY.

05:47.781 --> 05:51.485
HE EVEN BOUGHT ME BOXING GLOVES
TO TEACH ME TO BE A MAN.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.053
- HMM.
I LOVE BOXING.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.722
- OF COURSE YOU DO.

05:54.755 --> 05:57.491
I GLUED RHINESTONES ON THEM.
- OF COURSE YOU DID.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.527
- WELL, WOULDN'T
YOUR DADDY BE SURPRISED

05:59.560 --> 06:01.529
TO SEE THE MAN YOU'VE BECOME.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.606
- I GOT TO HAND IT
TO YOU, BRIAN,

06:12.640 --> 06:14.141
NOT MANY PEOPLE
WHO JUST GOT FIRED

06:14.174 --> 06:16.143
WOULD GO OUT AND SPEND $5,000

06:16.176 --> 06:19.146
ON A NEW LIQUID TELEVISION.

06:19.179 --> 06:22.149
- WELL, WHAT BETTER USE
OF MY FREE TIME THAN TO SHOP?

06:22.182 --> 06:24.017
- I'M JIM STOCKWELL,

06:24.051 --> 06:26.887
POLICE CHIEF AND COACH
OF MY SON'S BASKETBALL TEAM...

06:26.920 --> 06:29.022
- [scoffs]

06:29.056 --> 06:30.491
- WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.626
THE FIRST FUCKING THING YOU SEE

06:32.660 --> 06:35.529
ON YOUR BRAND-NEW 99-INCH
HOME-ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM

06:35.563 --> 06:36.897
IS STOCKWELL...

06:36.930 --> 06:38.666
IN ONE OF YOUR FUCKING
COMMERCIALS.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.200
- IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.202
THEY'RE RUNNING THESE SPOTS
ON EVERY LOCAL STATION.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.437
I SHOULD KNOW.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.706
I BOUGHT THE AIRTIME MYSELF.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.909
- NOW HIS HIGH-DEFINITION GHOST
HAS COME BACK TO HAUNT YOU.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.979
IT'S VERY DICKENSIAN.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.915
HEY...

06:54.948 --> 06:57.451
MAYBE THIS'LL CHEER YOU UP.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.522
- WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?

07:01.555 --> 07:03.924
- IT'S A NEW VILLAIN
I'M WORKING ON FOR RAGE.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.526
HIS NAME'S RAZORBACK.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.795
HE'S ACTUALLY A SWINE.
- YEAH, I NOTICED.

07:07.828 --> 07:11.064
- YES, BUT THANKS TO A RUTHLESS
ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE,

07:11.098 --> 07:12.933
HE CAN APPEAR
IN CLOSE-TO-HUMAN FORM

07:12.966 --> 07:14.835
AND HE'S RUNNING
FOR MAYOR OF GAYOPOLIS.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.970
- OH, I MARVEL AT HOW YOU
COME UP WITH THESE IDEAS.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.539
- MM-HMM.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.674
- HE'S ALREADY MESMERIZED
ALMOST EVERYONE

07:20.708 --> 07:21.742
INTO VOTING FOR HIM,

07:21.775 --> 07:23.577
BUT WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW IS,

07:23.611 --> 07:25.679
HE GOING TO SEND THEM
TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.681
- HOLY PORK CHOP.
- MM-HMM.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.017
SO RAGE HAS TO USE HIS POWER
OF MIND CONTROL

07:30.050 --> 07:31.552
TO EXPOSE RAZORBACK'S VILLAINY

07:31.585 --> 07:33.020
AND BRING EVERYONE
TO THEIR SENSES

07:33.053 --> 07:34.488
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

07:34.522 --> 07:38.826
- THAT'S SOME STORY.
- MM-HMM.

07:38.859 --> 07:42.763
IF ONLY THERE WERE A REAL RAGE
TO CHANGE EVERYONE'S MIND.

07:42.796 --> 07:46.867
- ...AS A CRIME FIGHTER
AND A PARENT IS,

07:46.900 --> 07:49.503
IF YOU SAY IT, MEAN IT.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.104
RIGHT, BOYS?

07:51.138 --> 07:52.873
both:
RIGHT, DAD.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.909
- I'VE GOT EXACTLY 43 MINUTES

07:55.943 --> 07:57.645
BEFORE I HAVE TO GET BACK
FOR CLASS.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.513
- ARE YOU SURE
WE WON'T BE DISTURBED?

07:59.547 --> 08:01.715
- AH, I CALLED
HUNTER'S SCHOOL AND...

08:01.749 --> 08:03.116
MMM, MMM.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.719
AND HE IS IN SPANISH LAB
AS WE SPEAK.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.254
- HOLA.
[both laugh]

08:07.287 --> 08:11.158
[knock at door]

08:11.191 --> 08:14.895
[both groan]

08:16.897 --> 08:18.632
BIBLES OR BEAUTY PRODUCTS?

08:18.666 --> 08:19.767
- EXCUSE ME?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.802
- TIMESHARE IN TAMPA?

08:21.835 --> 08:23.804
- UH, NO, UH, ACTUALLY,

08:23.837 --> 08:27.007
I'M LOOKING
FOR BENJAMIN BRUCKNER?

08:27.040 --> 08:28.809
- HEY, I'M BEN.
- HI.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.744
- [whispering] DON'T LET HER
SELL YOU SOMETHING

08:30.778 --> 08:31.912
FOR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.280
YOU DON'T NEED IT.
- SHH.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.015
- I HOPE I'M NOT
INTERRUPTING ANYTHING.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.750
- UH... NO.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.218
- UM, THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE
AT THE HIGH SCHOOL

08:38.251 --> 08:39.820
GAVE ME YOUR ADDRESS.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.321
- UH, IS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH HUNTER?

08:41.354 --> 08:43.156
- HUNTER?

08:43.190 --> 08:45.158
YOU--YOU MEAN JIMMY?

08:45.192 --> 08:48.261
IS THAT WHAT HE CALLS HIMSELF
THESE DAYS?

08:50.330 --> 08:52.733
I'M RITA MONTGOMERY.
I'M HIS MOM.

08:56.970 --> 09:00.040
- HE TOLD YOU
THAT I WAS IN PRISON?

09:00.073 --> 09:02.042
- FOR KILLING HIS FATHER.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.777
- OH, MY GOD.

09:03.811 --> 09:07.314
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY HE WOULD
SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.182
ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO CONFESS,
I DID THINK OF IT

09:09.216 --> 09:11.118
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.320
YOU KNOW, HE CHEATED
ON ME, AND...

09:13.353 --> 09:16.189
HE LEFT ME WITH A CHILD
AND WITHOUT A CENT.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.692
I COULD BARELY TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF.

09:18.726 --> 09:22.062
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY I HAD TO LET
HIM GO TO A FOSTER HOME.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.197
- AH, I CAN IMAGINE HOW
DIFFICULT THAT MUST'VE BEEN.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.199
- YEAH.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.702
I CALLED SOCIAL SERVICES
ABOUT A YEAR AGO

09:28.736 --> 09:31.204
TO TRY AND FIND HIM, AND THEY
TOLD ME THAT HE HAD RUN AWAY...

09:31.238 --> 09:35.075
AND I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR HIM EVER SINCE.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.945
- NOW YOU'VE FOUND HIM.
- YEAH.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.279
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW

09:39.312 --> 09:42.249
HOW HE SURVIVED ALL THIS TIME
ON HIS OWN.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.954
- HE WAS IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.222
- YEAH, UM...

09:49.256 --> 09:51.825
SO WE TOOK HIM IN.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.894
- YOU TWO ARE ANGELS.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.228
- [scoffs]

09:55.262 --> 09:56.964
- NO, THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.869

10:03.871 --> 10:08.108

TO STAY IN TOUCH?

10:08.141 --> 10:09.376
- NO, I...

10:09.409 --> 10:12.646
I INTEND TO DO
MORE THAN THAT. I...

10:12.680 --> 10:14.715
NOW THAT I HAVE A JOB
AND AN APARTMENT,

10:14.748 --> 10:17.417
I WANT HIM
TO COME LIVE WITH ME.

10:17.450 --> 10:21.021
AND, OF COURSE,
I KNOW IT WON'T BE EASY.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.856
I'M SURE HE'S VERY ANGRY,

10:22.890 --> 10:25.793
BUT I INTEND TO MAKE IT UP
TO HIM.

10:33.166 --> 10:37.871
[indistinct chatter]
- IT'S AN INTERESTING TAPE.

10:37.905 --> 10:42.142
BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
IS WHY YOU BROUGHT IT TO US,

10:42.175 --> 10:43.744
CONSIDERING
YOUR FORMER POSITION

10:43.777 --> 10:46.747
IN JIM STOCKWELL'S CAMPAIGN.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.950
- I'VE ALWAYS HAD A DEEP AND
ABIDING REGARD FOR THE TRUTH,

10:49.983 --> 10:53.754
ESPECIALLY WHERE POLITICIANS
ARE CONCERNED.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.222
- I REALIZE IF THIS WERE SHOWN,

10:55.255 --> 10:58.158
IT COULD SERIOUSLY DAMAGE
MY OPPONENT'S POSITION.

10:58.191 --> 11:01.294
- IT MIGHT EVEN LEAD
TO A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.965
- OR IT MIGHT ALSO LOOK
LIKE LAST-MINUTE DESPERATION,

11:04.998 --> 11:08.101
NOT TO MENTION DAMAGE
MY REPUTATION IF IT ISN'T TRUE.

11:08.135 --> 11:11.471
- COUNCILMAN--
- NO, MR. KINNEY, I'M SORRY.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.941
I'VE RUN A CLEAN CAMPAIGN.

11:13.974 --> 11:17.077
AND REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME,
I INTEND TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.782
- WELL...

11:21.815 --> 11:23.784
YOU KNOW,
STOCKWELL MAY BE A DICK,

11:23.817 --> 11:26.787
BUT AT LEAST HE'S NOT A PUSSY.

11:26.820 --> 11:29.056
- WITH ONLY A FEW DAYS TO GO
BEFORE THE ELECTION,

11:29.089 --> 11:30.357
POLICE CHIEF JIM STOCKWELL

11:30.390 --> 11:32.826

ADVANTAGE IN THE POLLS.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.494
HOWEVER, THE GAP
BETWEEN THE TWO CANDIDATES

11:34.527 --> 11:36.229

CONCEPTS TO CONCEIVE,

11:45.505 --> 11:48.075

11:51.879 --> 11:55.949

I CAN'T LET TED DRAG ME DOWN.

WHEN MICHAEL TOLD ME YOU WERE
HERE, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.794
- YEAH, MEL AND I KISSED
AND MADE UP.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.996
WELL, WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY KISS.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.998
- THEN LIFE WITH THE LESBIANS

12:45.032 --> 12:48.902
ISN'T AS HORRIFYING
AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT?

12:55.909 --> 12:57.811
LOOK...

13:00.380 --> 13:02.950
WHY DON'T YOU PACK YOUR THINGS
AND COME HOME?

13:02.983 --> 13:05.919
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.555

I KNOW. I BEHAVED ABYSMALLY.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.591
THERE'S NO EXCUSE...

13:29.342 --> 13:32.245
THEN I GUESS
I BETTER REMIND YOU.

13:42.622 --> 13:45.092

TED SCHMIDT.

13:53.366 --> 13:57.137

14:08.548 --> 14:10.650

I PROMISE.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.619
- YOU PROMISED BEFORE.
- I MEAN IT THIS TIME.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.621
- YOU MEANT IT BEFORE.
- THEN I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.656
I SWEAR--
- YEAH, TEDDY, DON'T.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.358

14:18.391 --> 14:21.128

YOU THINK I WANT TO HEAR

14:21.161 --> 14:22.662

14:22.695 --> 14:25.398
BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.971
I DON'T EVEN THINK
YOU BELIEVE YOURSELF.

ANY REASON TO?

14:36.076 --> 14:38.011

YOU'RE AN ADDICT.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.679

BUT IT'S TRUE.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.252
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.387

TO BE, FINE.

AM NOT GOING TO JOIN YOU.

TO YOU.

YEAH.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.234
THEY TURNED YOU
AGAINST ME, DIDN'T THEY?

15:01.268 --> 15:06.006
- NO, TEDDY. NO ONE TURNED ME
AGAINST YOU...

15:06.039 --> 15:08.308
EXCEPT YOU.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.547
LOOK...

15:14.581 --> 15:18.085
I HOPE YOU'LL GET SOME HELP.
- I DON'T NEED ANY HELP, OKAY?

15:18.118 --> 15:20.553
AND I DON'T NEED YOU TELLING ME
WHAT THE FUCK TO DO.

15:43.143 --> 15:46.313

KIND OF ATTITUDE IS THAT?

15:46.346 --> 15:47.714
- REALISTIC.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.449

15:49.482 --> 15:50.984
IF YOU'RE COUNTING

15:51.018 --> 15:53.120
ON THIS GROUP OF APATHETIC APES,

WHAT THE HELL DID THEY DO?

HIMSELF...

16:28.521 --> 16:30.590

FOR THAT KID,

POLICE CHIEF STOCKWELL

WE MAKE SUCH A LOVELY COUPLE.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.144
WE'RE BOTH... TALL.

22:25.177 --> 22:28.047
- SO WHY NOW?

22:28.080 --> 22:31.050
- I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT ENJOY
BEING THE CENTER OF ATTENTION.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.919
- [laughing]
HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT?

22:32.952 --> 22:35.522
- YOU'RE WITH ME.
- [laughs]

22:35.555 --> 22:37.524
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.392
- I KNOW.

22:39.426 --> 22:44.631
*

22:44.664 --> 22:46.533
AND YOU ALSO NEED TO MOVE ON.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.401
- I HAVE.

22:48.435 --> 22:51.471
- THEN FORGET ABOUT HIM.

22:51.504 --> 22:54.006
HE'S DEAD.

22:54.040 --> 22:57.744
- HE'S NOT DEAD.
- WELL, HE WILL BE SOON ENOUGH.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.946
BUT THAT'S HIS PROBLEM.

23:03.182 --> 23:04.951
KEEP DANCING.

23:04.984 --> 23:09.522
*

23:09.556 --> 23:11.758
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO IT.

23:11.791 --> 23:14.694
- IT'S EASY--JUST PUT ONE FOOT
IN FRONT OF THE OTHER.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.963
- I MEAN, BE SO HEARTLESS.

23:16.996 --> 23:19.031
- WELL, IT TAKES
A LITTLE PRACTICE,

23:19.065 --> 23:21.033
BUT EVENTUALLY
YOU GET THE KNACK.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.702
- WELL, I COULD NEVER BE
LIKE THAT.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.904
- SURE YOU COULD.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.639
- THEN GO BACK TO HIM,

23:26.673 --> 23:30.176
SHOW HIM HOW MUCH YOU CARE...

23:30.209 --> 23:32.845
AND LET HIM KILL YOU TOO.

23:32.879 --> 23:40.820
*

24:50.923 --> 24:52.859
- I'M GONNA HAVE BABIES
AND TAKE CARE OF THEM,

24:52.892 --> 24:55.194
GIVE THEM COD-LIVER OIL AND
WATCH THEIR TEETH GROW AND...

24:55.227 --> 24:57.864
AND IF I EVER SEE ONE OF THEM
LOOK AT A NEWSPAPER AGAIN...

24:57.897 --> 24:59.999
- I THOUGHT TONIGHT, INSTEAD OF,
UH, HAVING DINNER AT HOME,

25:00.032 --> 25:01.868
MAYBE WE COULD GO
TO THE SHANGHAI PALACE

25:01.901 --> 25:04.003
AND GORGE OURSELVES
ON THE NINE-COURSE FEAST,

25:04.036 --> 25:05.638
AND THEN AFTERWARDS,

25:05.672 --> 25:07.807
MAYBE WE COULD GO SEE
THE NEW JACKIE CHAN MOVIE.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.041
THINK HUNTER WOULD ENJOY THAT?

25:09.075 --> 25:10.910
- MICHAEL.

25:10.943 --> 25:13.880
- WHAT?

25:13.913 --> 25:16.182
- WE HAVE TO TELL HIM.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.656
- I KNOW.

25:26.058 --> 25:29.228
- HEY, PAL.
WHERE YOU BEEN?

25:29.261 --> 25:30.697
- PICKING UP SUNDAY BRUNCH.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.565
[clears throat]
WANT ONE?

25:32.599 --> 25:34.767
- [scoffs]
YEAH, I WANT ALL OF THEM,

25:34.801 --> 25:36.703
BUT I'LL REFRAIN.

25:36.736 --> 25:40.239
LISTEN, WE'VE GOT SOME NEWS
WE'VE BEEN MEANING TO TELL YOU.

25:40.272 --> 25:43.209
WE'VE JUST BEEN WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT TIME.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.677
RIGHT, MICHAEL?

25:44.711 --> 25:47.213
- YEAH, WELL,
I GUESS THIS IS IT.

25:49.682 --> 25:52.351
- WHAT?

25:52.384 --> 25:55.988
- YOU HAD A VISITOR
THE OTHER DAY.

25:56.022 --> 25:58.991
- WHAT KIND OF VISITOR?

25:59.025 --> 26:02.328
- SOMEONE WHO WANTS
TO SEE YOU VERY MUCH.

26:02.361 --> 26:04.196
- HUNTER, YOUR MOM WAS HERE.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.799
- FUCK!
HOW DID SHE FIND ME?

26:06.833 --> 26:08.334
- WELL, THE SCHOOL GAVE HER
OUR ADDRESS,

26:08.367 --> 26:10.136
SHE CAME TO SEE US AND...

26:10.169 --> 26:12.805
- SHIT!
- HEY! WHOA, HEY!

26:12.839 --> 26:15.842
[fast chatter on TV]

26:22.882 --> 26:26.218
[horn blares]

26:26.252 --> 26:27.820
HUNTER!

26:27.854 --> 26:29.722
- HUNTER!

26:29.756 --> 26:32.959
- CHRIST, JESUS CHRIST,
YOU RUN FAST!

26:32.992 --> 26:35.027
[grunts]

26:35.061 --> 26:37.096
- WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?

26:37.129 --> 26:38.765
GETTING AS FAR AWAY FROM HERE
AND HER AS I CAN!

26:38.798 --> 26:40.633
- LISTEN TO ME--
SHE SAID SHE FEELS TERRIBLE

26:40.667 --> 26:42.168
ABOUT GIVING YOU AWAY.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.370
SHE'S A LIAR!
DON'T BELIEVE A FUCKING WORD!

26:44.403 --> 26:46.238
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

26:46.272 --> 26:48.407
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID SHE WAS
IN JAIL FOR KILLING YOUR FATHER!

26:48.440 --> 26:49.976
- EXCUSE ME.
SHE ONLY STABBED HIM.

26:50.009 --> 26:52.378
- SHE WANTS
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

26:52.411 --> 26:54.246
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST TALK
TO HER, GIVE HER A CHANCE?

26:54.280 --> 26:55.982
- I'LL NEVER GO WITH HER!

26:56.015 --> 26:57.383
- HEY, TAKE IT EASY.
TAKE IT EASY.

26:57.416 --> 27:00.252
- DON'T!
GET OFF ME!

27:00.286 --> 27:01.921
- HEY.

27:01.954 --> 27:06.258
- I-I KNOW
WHY SHE WANTS ME BACK--

27:06.292 --> 27:08.895
TO SUPPLEMENT HER INCOME.

27:10.429 --> 27:14.333
"COME ON, JIMMY,
YOU LIVE HERE TOO.

27:14.366 --> 27:17.003
"YOU GOT TO PULL
YOUR OWN WEIGHT.

27:17.036 --> 27:20.172
WE ALL NEED TO WORK."

27:20.206 --> 27:22.174
- DOING WHAT?

27:25.444 --> 27:27.179
- HUNTER...

27:30.182 --> 27:32.852
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU CAN TELL US.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.299
- "YOU LIKE YOUNG DICK?

27:47.333 --> 27:50.036
"FOR $50,
YOU CAN SUCK IT.

27:50.069 --> 27:53.806
FOR $100,
I'LL LET YOU FUCK ME."

28:01.213 --> 28:03.449
YOU THINK I'M BULLSHITTING?

28:03.482 --> 28:05.351
FUCK YOU TOO!
- HUNTER, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

28:09.488 --> 28:11.858
WE BELIEVE YOU.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.462
- THERE'S NO WAY...

28:16.495 --> 28:19.732
WE'RE GOING TO LET YOU GO
WITH HER.

28:19.766 --> 28:22.301
THAT'S A PROMISE, OKAY?

28:26.773 --> 28:28.908
OKAY?

28:36.515 --> 28:38.350
- BRIAN?

28:38.384 --> 28:41.087
WHY ARE--WHY ARE YOU GETTING RID
OF YOUR NAKED-GUY PAINTING...

28:41.120 --> 28:43.255
AND YOUR ITALIA MODA SOFA

28:43.289 --> 28:47.426
AND YOUR MIES VAN DER ROHE
TABLE?

28:47.459 --> 28:50.362
- I THOUGHT I'D REDECORATE--
SOMETHING MINIMAL...

28:50.396 --> 28:52.431
- OKAY, GUYS.

28:52.464 --> 28:55.167
- SOMETHING TO MATCH
MY CURRENT NET WORTH.

28:55.201 --> 28:58.504
- WELL, I TOLD YOU,
NOW WASN'T THE BEST TI--

28:58.537 --> 29:00.372
OH, THE TV TOO?

29:00.406 --> 29:02.408
- MMM.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.376
GOOD THING IT WAS LIQUID.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.246
- BRIAN, IF YOU'RE IN TROUBLE,
I'M SURE I COULD LOAN YOU...

29:07.279 --> 29:10.016
- $100,000?

29:10.049 --> 29:11.851
- HOW MUCH?

29:11.884 --> 29:13.853
- [sighs]

29:13.886 --> 29:17.857
THE COST OF 20 30-SECOND
PRIMETIME SPOTS

29:17.890 --> 29:19.558
AT FIVE THOU A POP.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.028
- YOU SAID THAT WAS PAID
FOR BY THE--

29:22.061 --> 29:25.264
- MEET THE "CONCERNED CITIZENS
FOR THE TRUTH."

29:25.297 --> 29:26.899
- YOU.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.901
- WELL, WHO THE HELL ELSE
WAS GOING TO PAY FOR IT?

29:28.935 --> 29:30.269
[sighs]

29:30.302 --> 29:32.939
I MAXED OUT FIVE GOLD CARDS.

29:32.972 --> 29:37.409
- THOSE CONCERNED CITIZENS
REALLY ARE LUNATICS.

29:37.443 --> 29:40.146
- I THINK I'M EXPERIENCING
POSSESSION WITHDRAWAL.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.481
I NEED TO LAY DOWN.

29:42.514 --> 29:44.083
- GOOD THING
YOU DIDN'T SELL YOUR BED.

29:44.116 --> 29:47.053
- [scoffs]
I'D RATHER SELL A KIDNEY.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.588
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THIS.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.925
IT'S SO...
- NOBLE?

29:52.959 --> 29:56.428
- OUT OF CHARACTER.

29:56.462 --> 29:59.098
WHAT MADE YOU DO IT?

30:00.933 --> 30:02.568
- SOME ASSHOLE TOLD ME

30:02.601 --> 30:04.904
THAT IF YOU BELIEVE
IN SOMETHING STRONGLY ENOUGH,

30:04.937 --> 30:08.975
YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING
TO SACRIFICE EVERYTHING.

31:17.343 --> 31:22.148
[indistinct chatter]

31:22.181 --> 31:24.683
[laughter]

31:24.716 --> 31:28.054
- HEY, SLEEPING BEAUTY.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.156
- I MUST'VE CRASHED.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.258
- I'LL SAY.

31:32.291 --> 31:34.260
YOU'VE BEEN OUT
FOR A COUPLE DAYS.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.328
- OH, SHIT.

31:36.362 --> 31:39.331
[indistinct shouting]

31:39.365 --> 31:41.300
- THERE IT IS. THERE IT IS.
- OH, HE WANTS IT.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.702
OH, HE LOVED IT.
OH, YEAH, RIGHT THERE.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.271
- COME ON, MOVE IT.
IT'S MY TURN.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.573
COME ON. HERE I COME.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.541
- COME ON. GET IN THERE.
GET IN THERE.

31:49.575 --> 31:53.312
[laughter]

31:53.345 --> 31:55.414
- WHAT'S EVERYBODY WATCHING?

31:55.447 --> 31:57.583
- IT'S A LITTLE INDIE FEATURE--

31:57.616 --> 31:59.585
NOT MUCH IN THE WAY
OF PRODUCTION VALUES,

31:59.618 --> 32:02.721
BUT THE PERFORMANCES
ARE FABULOUS.

32:02.754 --> 32:07.359
[indistinct shouting]

32:07.393 --> 32:09.428
- LOOKS HOT.

32:09.461 --> 32:11.663
- IS HOT.

32:19.071 --> 32:21.373
- FUCK THAT ASS, MAN.

32:21.407 --> 32:24.043
- HERE HE GOES.
HERE HE GOES.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.744
- THERE YOU ARE.
COME ON.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.347
- [chuckles]

32:28.380 --> 32:30.716
YEAH.

32:30.749 --> 32:33.052
GO FOR IT.

32:33.085 --> 32:35.454
- AH, LOOK AT HIM TAKE IT.
YEAH.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.456
AH, LOOK AT THAT.
LOOK AT HIS FACE.

32:37.489 --> 32:40.326
HE'S LOVING IT.
- OH, YEAH.

32:40.359 --> 32:43.262
LOOK AT THAT SMILE.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.531
[laughter]

32:45.564 --> 32:49.635
- YEAH, COME ON.

32:55.107 --> 32:59.311
- YOU WERE HOT...
HOT, HOT, DARLING.

33:02.681 --> 33:06.118
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE
A PORN STAR?

33:17.663 --> 33:22.434
[indistinct chatter]

33:22.468 --> 33:24.103
- DID YOU VOTE YET?
- YES, MA'AM.

33:24.136 --> 33:25.171
- OKAY.
- THANKS.

33:25.204 --> 33:28.174
- DID YOU VOTE?
- YOU BET, DEB.

33:28.207 --> 33:29.575
- HOW ABOUT YOU?

33:29.608 --> 33:31.777
- I'M GOING TO.
- OH, GOSH.

33:31.810 --> 33:33.279
YOU'D BETTER HURRY...

33:33.312 --> 33:35.181
BEFORE YOUR FOOD GETS COLD.

33:35.214 --> 33:38.484
- [chuckles]

33:48.494 --> 33:51.330
- DID YOU TWO VOTE YET?
- WE'RE JUST ON OUR WAY.

33:51.363 --> 33:54.133
- I'D KEEP YOUR HANDS
OFF THOSE LEMON BARS.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.701
- JEEZ, MA,
YOU WANT US TO STARVE?

33:55.734 --> 33:57.469
- THIS ESTABLISHMENT
RESERVES THE RIGHT

33:57.503 --> 33:59.338
TO REFUSE SERVICE
TO ANYONE,

33:59.371 --> 34:01.073
AND THAT INCLUDES ANYONE

34:01.107 --> 34:03.609
WHO HAS NOT PERFORMED
THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ACT

34:03.642 --> 34:06.145
EXPECTED
OF EACH AND EVERY AMERICAN.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.347
- ANAL SEX?

34:08.380 --> 34:09.848
- IT'S WORKING, DEB.

34:09.881 --> 34:12.684
- WITH ONLY A HANDFUL
OF DISTRICTS REPORTING,

34:12.718 --> 34:14.820
IT'S STILL TOO EARLY
TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME

34:14.853 --> 34:16.688
OF TODAY'S MAYORAL ELECTION.

34:16.722 --> 34:19.425
MEANWHILE, IN RELATED NEWS,
A POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT

34:19.458 --> 34:22.294
AIRING ON LOCAL STATIONS
IS CAUSING A REACTION.

34:22.328 --> 34:24.496
- THAT'S THE FUCKING
UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE YEAR.

34:24.530 --> 34:26.232
- CHIEF STOCKWELL, AS YOU KNOW,

34:26.265 --> 34:27.866
THERE'S AN AD PAID FOR
BY A GROUP CALLING ITSELF

34:27.899 --> 34:29.768
"CONCERNED CITIZENS
FOR THE TRUTH"

34:29.801 --> 34:33.439
THAT IMPLIES YOU COVERED UP
THE MURDER OF A YOUNG GAY MAN.

34:33.472 --> 34:34.640
- KELLY, I CAN ASSURE YOU,

34:34.673 --> 34:36.642
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER
FROM THE TRUTH.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.744
- THEN YOU DENY
THE ACCUSATIONS?

34:38.777 --> 34:40.646
- THERE ARE NO ACCUSATIONS,

34:40.679 --> 34:42.648
MERELY INSINUATIONS
MADE TO DISCREDIT ME

34:42.681 --> 34:45.217
ON THE BRINK OF THE ELECTION.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.453
HOWEVER, I HAVE EVERY
CONFIDENCE THAT THE VOTERS

34:47.486 --> 34:48.754
OF OUR CITY

34:48.787 --> 34:50.589
WILL SEE THROUGH
THIS OBVIOUS SMEAR TACTIC

34:50.622 --> 34:52.724
AND NOT ALLOW IT TO INFLUENCE
THEIR DECISION MAKING

34:52.758 --> 34:54.593
WHEN THEY
GO TO THE POLLS.

34:54.626 --> 34:57.196
- AND I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE
THAT THE VOTERS ARE SMART ENOUGH

34:57.229 --> 34:59.398
TO REALIZE
THAT YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT.

34:59.431 --> 35:03.202
- ON CHANNEL 5,
WE'VE GOT YOU COVERED.

35:03.235 --> 35:06.238
- YOU PUT YOURSELF IN DEBT
TO THE TUNE OF...

35:06.272 --> 35:08.340
I CAN'T EVEN SAY IT.
I'LL HAVE A PANIC ATTACK.

35:08.374 --> 35:11.810
- $100,000.
- YEAH. THAT'S IT.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.747
[sighs]
- HEY, TAKE IT EASY.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.349
BREATHE DEEP.

35:17.383 --> 35:20.352
- YOU'RE SELLING OFF
YOUR POSSESSIONS?

35:20.386 --> 35:22.621
- THE VETTE'S NEXT TO GO.
- NO.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.156
- IT'S JUST A CAR.

35:24.190 --> 35:26.625
- THE CAR OF YOUR DREAMS.

35:26.658 --> 35:28.627
JESUS, BRIAN,
HOW COULD YOU DO IT?

35:28.660 --> 35:31.230
- WHAT, RISK EVERYTHING?

35:31.263 --> 35:32.898
SOMETIMES A...

35:32.931 --> 35:34.766
A GAY MAN'S GOT TO DO
WHAT A GAY MAN'S GOT TO DO.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.269
WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

35:37.303 --> 35:40.272
I END UP WITH A PACK OF GUM.

35:40.306 --> 35:41.840
LAST STICK.

35:47.546 --> 35:48.714
- WHAT'S ALL THIS?

35:48.747 --> 35:50.649
HEY, WHAT'S THE LINE FOR?

35:50.682 --> 35:52.384
- TO VOTE.

35:52.418 --> 35:54.553
- OH, I THOUGHT THEY WERE
HANDING OUT FREE POPPERS.

35:54.586 --> 35:57.723
- IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD,
THERE'S AN ELECTION.

35:57.756 --> 35:59.825
- NO SHIT.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.827
WHO'S RUNNING?

36:03.595 --> 36:05.297
- I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME OUT.

36:05.331 --> 36:07.433
- I THOUGHT
YOU WEREN'T COMING.

36:07.466 --> 36:10.436
[mellow guitar music]

36:10.469 --> 36:18.444
*

36:36.495 --> 36:37.763
- JUST A REMINDER--

36:37.796 --> 36:40.366
POLLS WILL BE OPEN
UNTIL 8:00 THIS EVENING.

36:40.399 --> 36:43.235
BE SURE AND STAY TUNED TO...
- UH, EXCUSE ME.

36:43.269 --> 36:45.637
- YES?
- HI. UM...

36:45.671 --> 36:47.339
[sniffs]

36:47.373 --> 36:50.709
MY NAME IS, UH, TED SCHMIDT,

36:50.742 --> 36:53.712
[sniffs]
AND, UH...

36:53.745 --> 36:54.880
I NEED SOME HELP.

36:54.913 --> 36:57.349
- * I'M SURROUNDED

36:57.383 --> 37:00.486
- ALL RIGHT, TED...
- * BUT I'M ON MY OWN

37:00.519 --> 37:02.321
* I'LL TRADE MY LIFE

37:02.354 --> 37:05.324
- NO, I'M OKAY.
- * FOR THE GREAT UNKNOWN

37:05.357 --> 37:09.728
* MIGHT BE COURAGE,
MAYBE NOT *

37:09.761 --> 37:11.763
- MY MOM WAS SO FREAKED OUT
ABOUT IT, BUT...

37:11.797 --> 37:15.267
BUT THERE WAS A LINE OF GUYS
LINED UP AROUND THE BLOCK,

37:15.301 --> 37:17.002
WAITING TO VOTE.
- SAME WHEN I WAS THERE.

37:17.035 --> 37:18.337
COULD NOT BELIEVE IT.
- YEAH.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.238
- JIMMY?

37:23.375 --> 37:25.511
[laughing]
OH, GOD. BABY?

37:28.647 --> 37:31.750
I BARELY RECOGNIZE YOU.

37:31.783 --> 37:35.287
LOOK HOW MUCH YOU'VE GROWN.
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY A MAN.

37:35.321 --> 37:38.490
[chuckles]

37:38.524 --> 37:40.292
COME HERE
AND GIVE YOUR MOM A HUG.

37:40.326 --> 37:41.527
- GET AWAY!

37:45.063 --> 37:47.433
- HE'S AT THAT AGE.
HE'S EMBARRASSED BY HIS MOTHER.

37:47.466 --> 37:50.436
- THAT CAN HAPPEN AT ANY AGE.

37:50.469 --> 37:53.805
- DID THESE TWO GENTLEMEN TELL
YOU THAT I CAME LOOKING FOR YOU?

37:53.839 --> 37:56.041
- I HEARD.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.943
- DID THEY ALSO TELL YOU THAT
I WANT YOU TO COME LIVE WITH ME?

37:57.976 --> 37:59.678
- NO FUCKING WAY.

37:59.711 --> 38:01.447
- MRS. MONTGOMERY, WE'VE TALKED
IT OVER WITH HUNTER,

38:01.480 --> 38:02.914
AND WE THINK
HE SHOULD STAY WITH US.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.551
- WHY SHOULD HE STAY WITH YOU?

38:05.584 --> 38:07.919
- BECAUSE HE WANTS TO...

38:07.953 --> 38:11.323
AND WE WANT HIM TO.

38:11.357 --> 38:13.325
- WELL, I'M HIS MOTHER,
AND I...

38:13.359 --> 38:16.061
I DON'T SEE
WHERE YOU GET A SAY.

38:16.094 --> 38:18.397
NOW I SAY GET YOUR STUFF
TOGETHER--WE'RE LEAVING.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.332
- I'M SORRY,
BUT AFTER WHAT HE TOLD US,

38:20.366 --> 38:21.933
HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.703
- WHAT DID HE SAY?
MORE OF YOUR STORIES?

38:24.736 --> 38:27.506
- HOW YOU MADE HIM WORK
TO PULL HIS OWN WEIGHT.

38:31.643 --> 38:35.080
- YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO, JIMMY,

38:35.113 --> 38:38.083
BUT I DO HAVE SOME IDEA
WHY YOU WANT HIM HERE,

38:38.116 --> 38:39.685
AND WHEN I TELL THE AUTHORITIES

38:39.718 --> 38:41.086
THAT MY TEENAGE SON
IS LIVING WITH TWO FAGS--

38:41.119 --> 38:42.488
- ALL RIGHT, MRS. MONTGOMERY,
THAT IS ENOUGH.

38:42.521 --> 38:43.589
NOW, IF YOU DO NOT MIND...

38:43.622 --> 38:45.056
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I MIND PLENTY.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.360
AND I'M GOING
TO COME BACK HERE

38:48.394 --> 38:49.628
WITH A COURT ORDER
AND THE POLICE,

38:49.661 --> 38:51.363
AND YOU BETTER GET HIM READY.

38:51.397 --> 38:52.564
JIMMY?

38:52.598 --> 38:53.565
BABY, BABY.

38:53.599 --> 38:56.602
MOM WILL SEE YOU LATER.

39:23.662 --> 39:26.031
- [sighs]

39:37.543 --> 39:40.512
- TED?

39:45.216 --> 39:47.886
- BLAKE?

39:47.919 --> 39:50.522
- I, UH...

39:50.556 --> 39:52.524
SAW YOUR NAME
AT THE FRONT DESK.

39:52.558 --> 39:55.427
- I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS
THE SAME TED SCHMIDT.

39:55.461 --> 39:58.830
- IN THE FLESH.

40:02.968 --> 40:05.070
I, UH...

40:08.106 --> 40:10.676
GOT MYSELF
IN A LITTLE TROUBLE.

40:10.709 --> 40:13.512
- IT'S... IT'S OKAY.

40:13.545 --> 40:17.516
YOU DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN.

40:17.549 --> 40:20.452
- [scoffs]

40:22.488 --> 40:25.557
- UH, LISTEN, UH...

40:25.591 --> 40:30.161
I'M GOING TO GROUP.
DID YOU WANT TO COME WITH ME?

40:32.998 --> 40:35.834
[sniffs] YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
I MEAN, I DID...

40:35.867 --> 40:38.003
SIGN UP
FOR THE BADMINTON TOURNAMENT.

40:38.036 --> 40:42.140
- [laughs]
YOU'RE STILL FUNNY.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.976
- [chuckles]

40:49.180 --> 40:52.117
[sniffs]
YEAH.

41:01.993 --> 41:03.962
LAST TIME I SAW YOU WAS...

41:03.995 --> 41:06.732
- WHEN YOU BROUGHT ME HERE.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.867
I DIDN'T STAY LONG.

41:08.900 --> 41:11.102
- AND NOW YOU'RE BACK.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.171
- YOU COULD SAY THAT.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.841
- [sighs]

41:15.874 --> 41:19.745
I GUESS IT ISN'T EASY
GETTING OFF THIS.

41:19.778 --> 41:21.813
- YOU'LL DO IT.

41:33.291 --> 41:35.827
- THIS OKAY?
- YEAH.

41:37.796 --> 41:40.599
WELL, LET'S GET STARTED.

41:40.632 --> 41:44.870
MY NAME IS BLAKE,
AND I'M YOUR COUNSELOR.

41:44.903 --> 41:47.138
- HEY, BLAKE.
- HI, BLAKE.

41:47.172 --> 41:49.274
- WE HAVE SOME NEW PEOPLE
WITH US TONIGHT.

41:49.307 --> 41:52.778
I'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU AND
TELL YOU HOW MUCH I ADMIRE...

41:52.811 --> 41:54.746
HOW MUCH WE ALL ADMIRE
YOUR COURAGE

41:54.780 --> 41:57.015
IN MAKING THIS CHOICE.

41:57.048 --> 41:59.284
- WITH MOST OF THE DISTRICTS
ALREADY REPORTING,

41:59.317 --> 42:01.152
THE RACE BETWEEN
POLICE CHIEF JIM STOCKWELL

42:01.186 --> 42:03.088
AND COUNCILMAN MARVIN DEEKINS

42:03.121 --> 42:05.156
STILL REMAINS
TOO CLOSE TO CALL.

42:05.190 --> 42:08.093
- WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE WIRE
ON THIS ONE, AARON.

42:08.126 --> 42:11.229
- I'M FUCKING OUT OF NAILS.
ANYBODY GOT SOME I CAN BORROW?

42:11.262 --> 42:12.764
- HERE, CHEW ON THESE.

42:12.798 --> 42:15.767
- FINALLY, AN ACT
OF SELFLESS GENEROSITY.

42:15.801 --> 42:18.169
- YOU KNOW WHAT THIS
REMINDS ME OF?

42:18.203 --> 42:20.238
HOMECOMING QUEEN.
[chuckles]

42:20.271 --> 42:22.808
- THERE WAS A LOT RIDING
ON THAT ELECTION AS WELL.

42:22.841 --> 42:24.943
- WAITING ALL NIGHT
FOR THE VOTES TO BE COUNTED.

42:24.976 --> 42:26.344
FORTUNATELY, I WON.

42:26.377 --> 42:28.179
- YOU TOO?

42:28.213 --> 42:31.650
- NOT TO RESORT TO TRITE
MUSICAL-THEATER REFERENCES

42:31.683 --> 42:35.320
AT THE 11TH HOUR, BUT I'VE BEEN
THROUGH NIXON, REAGAN,

42:35.353 --> 42:37.322
TWO BUSHES,

42:37.355 --> 42:39.658
AND I'M STILL HERE.

42:39.691 --> 42:43.662
AND, KIDDIES, IF I CAN SURVIVE
ALL THAT AND MORE,

42:43.695 --> 42:45.864
WE'LL SURVIVE THIS TOO.

42:45.897 --> 42:47.866
- THE INDOMITABLE SPIRIT
OF QUEERS EVERYWHERE.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.801
- HEAR, HEAR.

42:49.835 --> 42:51.002
- LATER ON IN THIS BROADCAST,

42:51.036 --> 42:52.738
OUR LIFESTYLE EDITOR,
SHEILA GODDARD,

42:52.771 --> 42:54.873
WILL SHOW US WHAT IT TAKES
TO GIVE A VICTORY PARTY

42:54.906 --> 42:56.041
FOR A NEW MAYOR.

43:05.016 --> 43:06.752
- OKAY, MA'AM.
- SHIT!

43:06.785 --> 43:09.387
SHE BROUGHT
THE FUCKING COPS!

43:09.420 --> 43:12.724
- HOLY CHRIST.
- I'M NOT GOING WITH HER.

43:12.758 --> 43:15.761
- LET'S TRY TO STAY CALM.

43:22.267 --> 43:25.971
LOOK, YOU MAY HAVE TO,
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT.

43:26.004 --> 43:27.172
- NO WAY. YOU PROMISED.

43:27.205 --> 43:28.974
- LOOK, TOMORROW
WE WILL GET AN ATTORNEY,

43:29.007 --> 43:30.742
AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT
THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE THIS,

43:30.776 --> 43:33.178
RIGHT, MICHAEL?

43:33.211 --> 43:36.114
- NO.

43:36.147 --> 43:38.016
- NO?

43:38.049 --> 43:39.651
- LOOK, YOU KNOW
AS WELL AS I DO

43:39.685 --> 43:41.920
THAT IF WE LET HIM GO WITH HER,
THAT'LL BE THAT,

43:41.953 --> 43:44.723
'CAUSE NO MATTER WHAT SHE DID
TO HIM, SHE'S STILL HIS MOTHER,

43:44.756 --> 43:45.991
AND WE'RE THE TWO FAGS.

43:46.024 --> 43:48.293
- SO WHAT
DO YOU SUGGEST WE DO?

43:48.326 --> 43:51.763
- [sighs]
COME ON.

43:53.164 --> 43:54.399
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

43:54.432 --> 43:56.401
- LEAVING.
- MICHAEL, YOU CAN'T.

43:56.434 --> 43:58.003
- LOOK, HE'S NOT GOING WITH HER,

43:58.036 --> 43:59.304
AND HE'S NOT GOING
BACK TO THE STREET.

43:59.337 --> 44:00.872
- THIS IS NOT THE WAY
TO DEAL WITH THIS.

44:00.906 --> 44:02.908
YOU REALIZE HOW MUCH TROUBLE
WE COULD GET IN?

44:02.941 --> 44:05.343
- YEAH, I REALIZE IT, BUT
RIGHT NOW I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

44:07.913 --> 44:10.448
- IF YOU GUYS STOP TO FUCK,
I'M SCREWED.

44:10.481 --> 44:11.783
- COME ON.
- MICHAEL...

44:11.817 --> 44:13.084
MIC--MICHAEL.

44:13.118 --> 44:15.320
- BACK STAIRS.

44:15.353 --> 44:16.922
- WAIT.

44:16.955 --> 44:18.423
- IF YOU FORGOT SOMETHING,
JUST LEAVE IT.

44:18.456 --> 44:20.692
THERE'S NO TIME.

44:28.199 --> 44:31.136
- MRS. MONTGOMERY?

44:32.370 --> 44:34.105
- [sighs]

44:34.139 --> 44:36.908
- AND, AARON, DID YOU KNOW
THAT FOR THE DEEKINS PARTY,

44:36.942 --> 44:39.444
3,200 CHICKEN BREASTS
WILL BE STUFFED.

44:39.477 --> 44:41.246
NOW, THAT'S A LOT OF BREASTS.

44:41.279 --> 44:43.314
- A FEW COMMENTS ON THAT--
- CAREFUL, WE'RE ON THE AIR.

44:43.348 --> 44:45.050
- AND WE DON'T WANT TO GET
OFF THE AIR,

44:45.083 --> 44:46.918
AT LEAST NOT UNTIL
AFTER THE ELECTION.

44:46.952 --> 44:48.920
- THAT'S RIGHT. SHEILA'S REPORT
IS COMING RIGHT UP.

44:48.954 --> 44:51.189
REMEMBER, WE'RE HERE
ALL THROUGH ELECTION NIGHT,

44:51.222 --> 44:53.792
SO YOU WON'T MISS ONE MOMENT.

44:53.825 --> 44:57.062
- THIS JUST IN--WITH 84%
OF THE VOTES COUNTED...

44:57.095 --> 44:58.797
- SHH.
- IT APPEARS WE CAN NOW DECLARE

44:58.830 --> 45:00.231
THAT THE NEW MAYOR
OF PITTSBURGH IS...

45:00.265 --> 45:01.733
MARVIN DEEKINS.

45:01.767 --> 45:05.236
[all cheering]

45:10.508 --> 45:12.210
- YES! YES!

45:12.243 --> 45:14.479
- AND HERE'S
AN INTERESTING FACT, AARON.

45:14.512 --> 45:16.815
IN AN OTHERWISE APATHETIC
VOTER TURNOUT,

45:16.848 --> 45:19.851
UNEXPECTEDLY HEAVY RETURNS
FROM THE 8TH DISTRICT

45:19.885 --> 45:21.352
MAY HAVE TIPPED THE OUTCOME.

45:21.386 --> 45:23.755
YES! WE MAY BE THE LAST VOTE
TO BE COUNTED,

45:23.789 --> 45:25.490
BUT WE'RE THE VOTE
THAT COUNTED MOST.

45:25.523 --> 45:27.392
[all cheering]

45:27.425 --> 45:29.995
- IT MUST BE DUE IN PART
TO THE LAST-MINUTE ALLEGATIONS

45:30.028 --> 45:31.963
THAT POLICE CHIEF STOCKWELL
WAS INVOLVED

45:31.997 --> 45:34.900
IN THE COVER-UP OF THE MURDER
OF A YOUNG GAY MAN.

45:34.933 --> 45:37.235
- COME ON, LET'S DANCE.

45:37.268 --> 45:39.905
- DAMN RIGHT WE'LL DANCE...
IN THE STREET!

45:39.938 --> 45:42.040

46:40.198 --> 46:42.133
YES!

46:56.347 --> 46:58.850
A WORD OF ADVICE,
MY SWEET EMMETT...

47:02.921 --> 47:05.823
MOURN THE LOSSES
BECAUSE THEY'RE MANY...

47:07.625 --> 47:09.861
BUT CELEBRATE THE VICTORIES...

47:09.895 --> 47:11.296
BECAUSE THEY'RE FEW.

47:16.367 --> 47:19.270
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T DANCED
SINCE THE LAST CENTURY.

47:23.041 --> 47:25.643
- WELL, IN ADDITION
TO THROWING FABULOUS PARTIES

47:25.676 --> 47:29.214
AND BEING A WORLD-RENOWNED
MASTER IN THE ART OF FELLATIO...

47:29.247 --> 47:30.615
- [laughs]

47:30.648 --> 47:33.952
- I'M ALSO ONE HELL
OF A DANCE INSTRUCTOR.

47:33.985 --> 47:36.354
MAY I?

47:36.387 --> 47:44.329
*

47:56.474 --> 47:58.910
[cell phone ringing]

47:58.944 --> 48:01.246
- MEL?
WHERE ARE YOU?

48:01.279 --> 48:03.114
- I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

48:03.148 --> 48:04.449
- IT'S INSANE.

48:04.482 --> 48:05.583
- WHAT?

48:05.616 --> 48:07.385
- I SAID IT'S...

48:07.418 --> 48:09.988
- MESHUGA, WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO FIND EACH OTHER.

48:10.021 --> 48:11.056
OH!

48:11.089 --> 48:14.192
- I SAID IT'S WONDERFUL.

48:14.225 --> 48:16.594
- I KNOW.

48:16.627 --> 48:18.997
- HE LOST.
- WHAT--WHO DID?

48:19.030 --> 48:22.133
- STOCKWELL!
YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T...?

48:22.167 --> 48:24.135
WELL, WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY?

48:24.169 --> 48:25.703
- I GOT THROUGH
MY FIRST TRIMESTER TODAY.

48:25.736 --> 48:27.338
[both laughing]

48:27.372 --> 48:30.208
- NOW THAT'S A VICTORY
WORTH CELEBRATING.

48:30.241 --> 48:38.349
*

48:38.383 --> 48:42.153
- WOW.

48:42.187 --> 48:44.956
- THANKS TO RAGE,
THE STREETS OF GAYOPOLIS

48:44.990 --> 48:47.025
ARE ONCE AGAIN SAFE
FOR PERVERTS.

48:47.058 --> 48:54.499
*

48:57.535 --> 49:00.205
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

49:00.238 --> 49:04.242
- I'M USING MY POWERS
OF MIND CONTROL.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.311
- DROP YOUR PANTS...

49:06.344 --> 49:07.378
BEND OVER.

49:10.481 --> 49:14.585
UH, SURELY YOU CAN, UH,
USE YOUR AMAZING SUPERPOWERS

49:14.619 --> 49:16.721
FOR SOMETHING
MORE CONSTRUCTIVE THAN THAT.

49:16.754 --> 49:18.623
- TRY AS I MIGHT,

49:18.656 --> 49:20.458
I CAN'T COME UP
WITH ANYTHING ELSE.

49:20.491 --> 49:21.459
YOU...

49:27.098 --> 49:29.067
- BRIAN!

49:29.100 --> 49:30.735
- HEY, YOU'RE LATE
FOR THE PARTY.

49:30.768 --> 49:33.071
- STOCKWELL LOST.
- YEAH, MARVIN DEEKINS WON.

I'VE LOST EVERYTHING.

50:50.748 --> 50:52.817

50:52.850 --> 51:00.525
