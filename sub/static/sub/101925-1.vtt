- [Rose] So how's New York?
- [Julia] So New York is a city.

01:49.467 --> 01:51.491
- [Sam] A lot of people?
- [Julia] A lot of people, yeah.

01:51.557 --> 01:54.730
- [Rose] Have you fucked most of them?
- [Gus] More than here?

01:54.796 --> 01:57.244
- [Julia] No, I have not.
- [Zara] Were you staying in Chelsea?

01:57.310 --> 01:59.544
- No, the art exhibition I'm having
in five weeks is in Chelsea though.

01:59.610 --> 02:01.976
Oh my god, thanks for remembering, you
would love it, I'd love to have you there.

02:02.042 --> 02:03.346
- I really want to go.

02:03.412 --> 02:05.226
- [Julia] I told Patrick
all about you guys.

02:05.292 --> 02:09.418
If you wanted to come and see the
opening, or maybe we could Skype?

02:09.708 --> 02:11.324
- Square box.

02:11.672 --> 02:14.606
I'm sure Peter would love to have
us all there, I mean Patrick, sorry.

02:14.672 --> 02:16.807
- [Gus] It's Patrick Oldman.
- [Henri] Hey guys.

02:16.873 --> 02:19.577
- [Everyone] Hello! Hi! Henri!

02:20.901 --> 02:24.101
- My god. You didn't
tell me you were coming!

02:25.494 --> 02:27.836
- I thought you were busy with stuff.
- I'm here.

02:29.251 --> 02:32.611
- [Henri] I'm just going to get a drink, guys.
- [Julia] Yeah, where's your plus one?

02:33.037 --> 02:35.437
- [Henri] My Tinder date?
She couldn't make it tonight.

02:35.835 --> 02:38.139
- I haven't seen you in ages.

02:38.982 --> 02:40.222
- She's crazy.

02:40.288 --> 02:41.518
(laughing)

02:41.584 --> 02:43.934
- You're crazy, Mr. Singular.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
- [Julia] What?
- [Rose] Oh, by the way (whistling).

02:47.580 --> 02:50.488
- [Zara] Oh my god, thanks
for spoiling my surprise.

02:50.778 --> 02:53.796
- [Rose] I'm not that observant, but
don't you have purple eyeshadow on?

02:53.862 --> 02:55.632
- I always have purple eyeshadow on.

02:55.698 --> 02:58.454
- [Rose] And don't they have purple eyeshadow?
- [Julia] They do.

03:00.239 --> 03:02.896
- Oh my god, I've missed you.
- I've missed you too.

03:02.962 --> 03:05.116
- [Rose] G-string, I choose Henri.

03:05.182 --> 03:08.716
- What did you say? Why is he
single-o? His with Millie.

03:08.782 --> 03:14.127
- [Rose] She is no longer in our clan
and that causes celebration!

03:14.193 --> 03:17.619
- [Gus] We're already having a celebration Rose!
- [Rose] I know!

03:19.925 --> 03:21.725
- [Gus] This is Julia Return Day!

03:22.016 --> 03:23.579
- Ok, tonight...

03:24.292 --> 03:27.101
- [Julia] When did they break up?
- [Rose] Shouldn't you answer that question?

03:27.167 --> 03:28.701
- Do we have to have
this conversation here?

03:28.767 --> 03:31.797
- [Julia] Yeah we do, because you guys are shitting with me.
- [Rose] Welcome to the world!

03:31.863 --> 03:33.852
- [Rose] Surprise!
- [Henri] Can we chat? Sorry guys.

03:33.918 --> 03:36.727
- It's like your birthday
present, welcome to Melbourne.

03:36.793 --> 03:39.163
- Thank you I'm so happy,
I'm so happy, oh my god.

03:39.535 --> 03:41.976
- I was going to tell you.
- Yeah, but you didn't. Did you? And I asked you.

03:42.042 --> 03:43.997
I said hey, how's Millie
going? Is Millie good?

03:44.063 --> 03:46.697
- I was waiting until you got home.
- And you said she's well, she's fine.

03:46.763 --> 03:48.519
- It's just easier to say that on
Skype. Now you're home.

03:48.585 --> 03:50.067
- So you lied, you lied because what?

03:50.357 --> 03:51.769
- Come on!
- You lied about Patrick.

03:51.835 --> 03:53.737
- I didn't lie about him, I just didn't
tell you everything that happened.

03:53.803 --> 03:55.937
- I told you that we're together.
- Do they know about Vegas?

03:56.003 --> 03:57.937
- They don't fucking know about Vegas.
- Do your parents know?

03:58.003 --> 04:00.833
- No, and no one's going to find
out about that, Henri.

04:00.899 --> 04:02.965
- Until I'm ready to tell them.
- Fine.

04:03.031 --> 04:05.565
- You're complaining all the time that
I'm too selfish and that I don't –

04:05.631 --> 04:08.751
- I just wanted to wait. I'm sorry, I
should have told you before, but it's...

04:09.017 --> 04:12.051
- It's just been messy.
- Well I'll tell my parents when I'm ready, alright?

04:12.117 --> 04:13.651
Because it's Dad 60th and that's the focus.

04:13.717 --> 04:15.879
And the focus is on him and my mum,
and make sure they're sane.

04:15.945 --> 04:18.265
And ok that I live away, and
all that kind of stuff, so...

04:18.507 --> 04:21.263
- I would appreciate it if you bide me some time.
- Ok.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.531
- Great.
- We're cool?

04:22.597 --> 04:24.119
- Yep!
- Let's have a good night.

04:24.459 --> 04:25.691
- [Julia] Drink up!

04:27.079 --> 04:30.409
So congratulations to Henri.

04:30.876 --> 04:32.876
- [Everyone] Henri! Henri!

04:33.251 --> 04:35.268
- [Julia] For being single,
and free from Millie.

04:35.334 --> 04:36.379
- [Henri] Single life!

04:36.445 --> 04:38.935
- Talking about freedom. Will Peter –

04:40.133 --> 04:44.442
Patrick let you ever step out
of your little square box? Will you?

04:44.508 --> 04:47.788
- Look, I told him about my choices
in life and he's open to that.

04:47.854 --> 04:50.160
And like you and I were doing
when we were together

04:50.226 --> 04:52.086
I'd let him know before I did something.

04:52.152 --> 04:54.686
- [Rose] Yeah, but Zara was cool.
- [Zara] And you didn't always let me know.

04:54.752 --> 04:56.566
- But I would text you if I
was out and I met a girl.

04:56.632 --> 04:58.894
- How long after you met him
did you sleep with him?

04:59.331 --> 05:02.345
- He actually wouldn't let me sleep
with him for about a week.

05:02.411 --> 05:04.046
- [Henri] He wouldn't let her!
- [Zara] About a week!

05:04.112 --> 05:06.372
- [Julia] It was sexy!
- [Sam] Was he on his period?

05:06.836 --> 05:08.533
- Who are you? Who is this guy?

05:08.599 --> 05:09.727
(laughter)

05:09.793 --> 05:13.018
- And, if you were in an open space –

05:13.084 --> 05:15.166
- Oh, we didn't have sex in the gallery.

05:15.232 --> 05:16.319
(laughter)

05:16.385 --> 05:17.645
- [Rose] With your eyes!

05:17.751 --> 05:19.685
G-string and Just Sam?

05:19.751 --> 05:23.268
Would you ask each other or tell each
other if you wanted to fuck somebody else?

05:23.334 --> 05:26.552
Or would you just not want to know?

05:26.618 --> 05:28.958
- Oh no, we have done
that and it doesn't work.

05:29.024 --> 05:31.158
- That doesn't work?
- It doesn't work for us.

05:31.224 --> 05:33.226
- And sometimes people don't
actually want to fuck other people.

05:33.292 --> 05:37.068
- [Julia] It worked fine for us.
- [Sam] Zara's face doesn't say it worked fine for us.

05:37.134 --> 05:39.101
- [Zara] I don't really want to talk about it.
- [Gus] Yeah, worked fine for you!

05:39.167 --> 05:41.925
- [Julia] Who are you?
- [Gus] He's observant.

05:41.991 --> 05:43.491
- I don't want to...

05:44.000 --> 05:46.787
- [Zara] Yeah, I really don't really want to do this.
- [Rose] Julia, you really need to just tell me this?

05:46.853 --> 05:48.166
- [Rose] J!

05:48.232 --> 05:50.392
- [Julia] Come on, it's your
turn to kiss someone, go!

05:50.838 --> 05:52.071
- [Henri] What?
- [Julia] Yeah.

05:52.767 --> 05:54.236
- [Rose] J?
- [Julia] What?

05:54.302 --> 05:56.909
Since when have you wanted
to just fuck one person?

05:56.975 --> 05:59.644
Because since I've known you

05:59.710 --> 06:02.922
that has been the most
fearful thing in your existence.

He's excited to meet you
and is excited to be able...

07:46.997 --> 07:50.835
We went to Vegas and
thought it would be fun.

God damn it.

07:58.223 --> 08:00.531
I want you guys to know.

08:01.459 --> 08:02.995
That...

08:03.571 --> 08:05.871
You have a son in law.

08:07.481 --> 08:08.597
Whoʼs...

08:11.523 --> 08:13.431
I love him.

08:14.301 --> 08:16.052
I really love him.

08:16.574 --> 08:17.706
(door opening)

08:17.772 --> 08:19.366
- [Tim] Jules?
- [Julia] Yeah?

08:19.432 --> 08:20.432
- Lunch is ready.

08:20.748 --> 08:22.238
- Yeah, I'm coming.

08:26.702 --> 08:29.710
(Footsteps)

08:30.000 --> 08:33.134
- [Anita] Sweetheart, you're
playing with clay at the dinner table.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.426
- [Julia] Well, I actually
wanted to talk about that

08:35.492 --> 08:38.261
and the fact that I'm excited to share –

08:38.327 --> 08:40.104
- [Anita] That's disgusting!
- [Julia] What?

08:40.170 --> 08:41.736
- [Tim] I think you need to go and wash.

08:41.802 --> 08:44.514
- [Julia] I will! I want to just finish this piece.
- [Anita] She gets that from you.

08:44.580 --> 08:46.443
- [Anita] Not from my side.
- [Julia] It's about to end!

08:46.509 --> 08:48.943
I just need to finish it,
it's nearly done I promise.

08:49.009 --> 08:51.268
I really want to show you
more of the work I'm doing.

08:51.334 --> 08:52.352
- [Anita] Darling?
- [Julia] Yeah?

08:52.418 --> 08:53.954
- Not at the table, please.
- [Julia] Ma, it's –

08:54.020 --> 08:55.468
- Not at the dinner table, please.

08:55.534 --> 08:57.908
- [Julia] Okay, okay, okay. I'll stop.

08:57.974 --> 09:02.093
I just wanted to say that I would like
us to Skype more often together and...

09:02.159 --> 09:04.793
- [Tim] Of course.
- [Julia] I'm having this big exhibition in New York.

09:04.859 --> 09:06.067
- [Anita] You're not staying longer?

09:06.133 --> 09:07.382
- [Julia] Here?
[Anita] Yeah.

09:07.448 --> 09:08.976
- [Julia] Yeah, I'm
here for Dad's birthday.

09:09.042 --> 09:11.102
- [Anita] Okay. I hoped that
you'd stay a bit longer than that.

09:11.168 --> 09:13.218
- [Tim] We thought that you
would stay a bit longer than that.

09:13.284 --> 09:15.884
- [Anita] Anyway...
- [Tim] A couple of weeks, three weeks maybe?

09:16.280 --> 09:20.006
- There's some really handsome
young men coming to dad's birthday party.

09:20.412 --> 09:21.904
(doorbell)

09:21.970 --> 09:24.426
- [Julia] Did you invite someone?
- [Tim] No, I don't know.

09:24.492 --> 09:27.086
- [Julia] Who is that? Dad!
- [Tim] I don't know, I'll have a look.

09:27.152 --> 09:29.590
- [Julia] I can't do sculpture but dad's
allowed to have business meetings at lunch.

09:29.656 --> 09:30.795
Mum, this is ridiculous.

09:30.861 --> 09:33.221
- [Anita] They can probably smell
the roast down the street.

09:33.879 --> 09:38.310
- Anyway playing with clay at the table is grotty.
- [Julia] All right. I'll clean the glass.

09:38.376 --> 09:40.512
I just don't want it to dry out.
You know what I mean.

09:41.169 --> 09:43.115
- Look what I found at the door.

09:43.181 --> 09:46.181
- [Henri] Surprise!
- [Anita] What a lovely surprise.

09:47.457 --> 09:49.768
- [Henri] Hope you like Cab Sav.
- [Anita] I was just talking about...

09:49.834 --> 09:51.624
- [Julia] What the fuck are you doing here?
- [Anita]... our handsome friend.

09:51.690 --> 09:53.424
- [Henri] How are you?
- [Julia] What's he doing here?

09:53.490 --> 09:55.526
- [Tim] I don't know. I
know nothing about this.

09:55.592 --> 09:57.766
- Are you having business
meetings when I'm not around?

09:57.832 --> 09:59.832
- [Henri] Long time no see!

10:01.418 --> 10:04.003
- [Julia] What are you doing here?
- [Henri] Your mum invited me.

10:04.069 --> 10:05.559
- What the fuck?

10:05.625 --> 10:07.277
- She called me.

10:07.501 --> 10:09.691
- [Julia] That's amazing.

10:10.876 --> 10:13.580
- [Anita] Darling, do you
want to look after everyone?

10:13.646 --> 10:16.646
- I'm going to go back to making my sculpture.
- [Henri] Where should I sit?

10:17.268 --> 10:19.602
- [Anita] To having our
beautiful daughter back.

10:19.668 --> 10:21.020
- [Henri] Yes, you must be happy.

10:21.086 --> 10:25.519
- [Anita] To having a handsome young visitor. And
of course to your birthday tomorrow. Let's toast.

10:25.585 --> 10:27.265
- [Julia] Yeah go dad!
[Everyone cheers]

10:27.331 --> 10:28.393
- [Tim] Eye contact!

10:28.459 --> 10:30.579
- [Julia] Eye contact, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Eye contact!

10:32.352 --> 10:35.039
- [Tim] Henri, how do you
happen to be here today?

10:35.329 --> 10:36.363
- [Julia] Yeah, Mum.

10:36.429 --> 10:39.073
- Well I got a phone call, well, Iʼll
let you explain the story, Anita.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.811
- [Anita] Okay. Well could I have a
60th and not have Henri here?

10:42.877 --> 10:45.918
Would it be your true birthday?
He's part of the family.

10:46.266 --> 10:47.746
- [Julia] Like a little brother.

10:50.876 --> 10:53.529
- [Julia] Dad, how many brussel sprouts do you want?
- [Tim] Two, thanks.

10:53.595 --> 10:55.692
- Two, alright. Do you want carrots?

10:56.272 --> 10:57.278
Oh shoot!

10:57.344 --> 10:59.126
- [Henri] What a catch!

10:59.192 --> 11:01.912
- [Julia] I think my dad wants your germs.
- [Henri] Ten second rule.

11:02.103 --> 11:04.000
- [Tim] So, Patrick. So
what's happening there?

11:04.519 --> 11:06.863
- Well, we're really happy together.
We've been living together about

11:06.929 --> 11:08.153
twelve months now.

11:08.219 --> 11:09.469
Which has been really special.

11:09.535 --> 11:10.715
- [Tim] What does he actually do?

11:10.781 --> 11:13.547
- He's the art critic for
The New York Times.

11:14.061 --> 11:16.247
- [Tim] So he's a critic. He doesn't do,

11:16.313 --> 11:18.615
he critiques other people's doing.
- [Julia] I'm glad you mentioned it.

11:18.681 --> 11:20.015
Okay, so Henri knows about this.

11:20.081 --> 11:21.783
So he does sometimes do.

11:21.849 --> 11:25.918
He sometimes dabbles in some
charcoal work and some sketches.

11:26.155 --> 11:28.431
So he wanted you both to have this.

11:28.497 --> 11:31.697
It's a portrait of me when we
first met in our first month.

11:33.251 --> 11:35.977
It's on the writing paper
because he's a critic, right.

11:36.043 --> 11:39.109
So he wanted to share the writing of time,

11:39.175 --> 11:41.009
- the body lines.
- [Anita] It doesn't look a lot like you.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.473
- [Henri] Yeah, I was going to say that.

11:42.539 --> 11:44.609
- Mind you, he's a critic, not an artist.

11:44.675 --> 11:45.976
- [Julia] Youʼre kidding, really?

11:46.042 --> 11:48.002
- [Henri] I don't think
it really looks like you.

11:48.292 --> 11:50.612
- [Anita] Yeah, it doesn't.
- [Tim] The eyes maybe, but...

11:51.314 --> 11:53.417
- [Julia] Anyway, so it's
for you dad, yeah, thanks.

11:53.483 --> 11:58.001
- [Tim] The only thing I'm a bit concerned
about is the age difference.

11:59.059 --> 12:01.087
Because he's quite a bit older than you.

12:01.153 --> 12:02.806
- [Anita] A bit?

12:02.872 --> 12:06.014
- [Tim] I mean is this a daddy complex or something?
- [Julia] No.

12:07.475 --> 12:11.000
- [Julia] Yeah, I think we're on a mental –
- [Tim] What's the age difference?

12:11.649 --> 12:12.999
- [Julia] It's a bit

12:13.065 --> 12:14.934
- So youʼre like the handbag, are you?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.040
- [Julia] I'm not the
handbag Mum, that's horrible.

12:17.577 --> 12:21.698
That's horrible! He really wants to meet you
guys, he's nice, can you tell them how kind he is.

12:21.764 --> 12:24.453
- [Henri] Yeah, I've seen him on Skype.
He seems like a really nice guy.

12:24.519 --> 12:26.056
- [Julia] That's so degrading.

12:26.376 --> 12:29.934
What do you take me for? Mum, Iʼm my own
artist, I'm making work, I'm selling my stuff.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.134
- [Anita] So you don't need him.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.424
- I don't need him. I'm choosing to be with
him because it's great to be with him.

12:34.490 --> 12:38.078
He's really supportive, he understands what I
do, I don't have to justify myself every day.

12:38.144 --> 12:40.508
- [Henri] He's been helping
Julia a lot in the last six months.

12:40.574 --> 12:44.508
Yeah and it's not like being here where I'm
always having to justify what I do to family,

12:44.574 --> 12:46.574
to your brothers always asking, come on!

12:46.806 --> 12:49.340
- [Anita] I've never known
you to need help with your art.

12:49.406 --> 12:53.279
- I don't need help with my art. I'm
feeling passionate and focused in my art.

12:53.345 --> 12:59.402
I'm having an exhibition of my own,
big sculpt pieces in Chelsea. I'm –

12:59.468 --> 13:01.161
- [Anita] That part I'm happy about.
- [Julia] Great.

13:01.227 --> 13:03.238
- [Anita] I'm not happy about
you living there, I prefer you living –

13:03.304 --> 13:06.452
- [Julia] I know –
- [Tim] We have been very supportive of you

13:06.518 --> 13:10.158
- [Julia] Yeah, I know and I am grateful for that.
- [Tim] going away and pursuing your art.

13:10.311 --> 13:13.431
I mean if I had my way, you would
have gone into financial law.

13:13.497 --> 13:15.235
- Dad, I had a scholarship for art.

13:15.301 --> 13:18.520
- [Tim] I know.
- [Julia] I got a scholarship to go America and study and bring –

13:18.586 --> 13:21.510
- You're one subject off a law degree.

13:21.576 --> 13:24.451
One subject off a law
degree. It's still sitting there.

13:24.517 --> 13:26.535
- And I can go back to that if I want to.

13:26.601 --> 13:29.085
- If.
- I am doing really well.

13:29.151 --> 13:32.419
- You always said that you
were going to move back here.

13:32.709 --> 13:35.100
New York was only supposed to be temporary.

13:35.166 --> 13:37.828
- I wasn't getting any attention here.

13:39.042 --> 13:41.042
No one took me seriously.

13:41.108 --> 13:43.342
And there I am making work every day.

13:43.408 --> 13:46.492
- [Henri] Do you think Patrick would
come back over here and live here?

13:46.558 --> 13:48.702
- [Julia] Ah, maybe. Yeah, sure.

13:48.768 --> 13:53.978
I mean he loves me. He wants me to be happy, he
wants to be where I am and we'd make that work.

13:54.044 --> 13:55.478
- [Tim] How serious is it?

13:55.544 --> 13:56.344
- Um.

13:58.215 --> 13:59.389
It's pretty serious.

14:00.821 --> 14:04.427
Yeah, we took a trip to Vegas, actually.

14:04.946 --> 14:08.076
- [Anita] We should go. Why don't we
go over there? That would be great.

14:08.142 --> 14:10.576
We could go on holiday.
Would you like us to come?

14:10.642 --> 14:13.576
- [Julia] It would be amazing to
have you guys there for the art exhibition.

14:13.642 --> 14:16.914
- Or maybe we can come to the exhibition, and
fly to vegas on the way back, or something?

14:16.980 --> 14:18.810
- Would you like to join us?

14:18.876 --> 14:20.410
- [Henri] Yeah, I'd love to go to Vegas.

14:20.476 --> 14:25.376
- [Anita] Would you mind if it was just us? And
we left Patrick at home to have quiet family...

14:25.724 --> 14:29.924
- [Julia] I think we could totally have family
time, the three of us together, but I, ah -

14:30.000 --> 14:32.334
- No, the four because
Henri could join us -

14:32.400 --> 14:35.440
- [Julia] Well, Vegas is actually a special
spot for Patrick and I. We got...

14:35.810 --> 14:37.210
We got married there.

14:38.561 --> 14:39.727
- [Tim] I'm sorry?

14:39.793 --> 14:42.793
-Yeah, I'm married. You have a son-in-law.

14:44.453 --> 14:46.453
-When did you get married?

14:47.308 --> 14:48.608
-Did you know this, Henri?

14:48.793 --> 14:51.153
-Yes, I mean I shared it with Henri.

14:51.501 --> 14:53.101
-Yes, Julia told me.

14:54.209 --> 14:56.609
- [Anita] When did she tell you?

14:57.104 --> 14:58.938
- About six months ago.

14:59.004 --> 15:02.722
- [Anita] So everybody knew it except for
us! And they've been married for six months!

15:02.954 --> 15:04.960
- Fuck you! You said...

15:05.726 --> 15:10.258
- Our only daughter gets married and we don't
know about it and we're not even invited.

15:10.324 --> 15:13.924
- [Julia] No, we want... we wanted
it to be something special -

15:14.209 --> 15:18.048
- [Anita] It would have been something special
if you got married and invited your parents.

15:18.343 --> 15:19.711
- [Julia] It just happened, Mum.

15:19.943 --> 15:21.047
- No, it doesn't just happen.

15:21.113 --> 15:24.543
- [Julia] It does just happen. It was love.
We fell in love and it was amazing,

15:24.609 --> 15:26.644
so we took a flight down there, okay.
- [Anita] You're not a little child.

15:26.710 --> 15:30.424
-I'm not a child. You're right. I went with my
gut, it made sense, it's what I'm here to do.

15:30.490 --> 15:33.260
- [Anita] And, your gut is to what?
Our only daughter!

15:33.745 --> 15:36.345
- You guys don't own me. Come on!

15:36.983 --> 15:40.045
[Julia] I want to be able to discuss this with you.
For you to be happy about the choices I've made.

15:40.111 --> 15:44.111
You guys had a similar problem when you
first got together, like it was challenging

15:44.343 --> 15:47.777
at the time to be from different universes, different cultures.
- [Anita] We had our parents at our wedding.

15:47.843 --> 15:49.634
- [Julia] Mum, this is not fair.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.260
I really wanted to share -
- [Anita] You're right, it's not fair.

15:54.211 --> 15:55.715
- [Julia] What the fuck!

15:55.781 --> 15:57.899
Why can we never have
a discussion in this place?

15:57.965 --> 15:59.412
Did you get married by Elvis or what?

15:59.478 --> 16:01.110
- Oh, fuck you!

16:02.517 --> 16:05.677
It's really great to see you, Henri, thanks
for coming. Really great. Thank you.

16:10.744 --> 16:13.244
(sad music)

16:14.594 --> 16:15.740
(knocking)

16:28.233 --> 16:29.239
- Hi.

16:32.733 --> 16:34.265
Got you something to cheer you up.

16:41.607 --> 16:45.261
- It was my thing to tell them and you had no
right letting them know itʼs been six months.

16:45.327 --> 16:47.807
I don't understand what the fuck you
are you doing here, so...

16:48.499 --> 16:50.209
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16:52.277 --> 16:53.451
I'm really sorry.

16:58.367 --> 17:00.417
I just didn't expect that would happen.

17:00.483 --> 17:04.083
- Yeah well, I did. Today
was my one day to tell them.

17:04.877 --> 17:08.177
My one day to like deal with all this shit
before the birthday, before they

17:08.861 --> 17:12.231
throw a tantrum, have a hissy fit and...

17:16.036 --> 17:17.120
I don't get it.

17:17.186 --> 17:20.302
I don't get why you would
feel entitled to show up.

17:20.908 --> 17:22.761
- I didn't show – I didn't know.

17:22.827 --> 17:26.572
It was just so hard in the moment,
your parents were asking me to –

17:26.638 --> 17:29.314
- When did she ask you to come over?
When did that happen?

17:29.380 --> 17:30.972
- It was only a few days ago.

17:31.427 --> 17:33.561
Why would I say – Of
course I would say yes.

17:33.627 --> 17:36.185
- You have a life, don't you?
Don't you do other things, Henri?

17:36.677 --> 17:38.209
- I wasn't doing anything tonight.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.849
(Julia sighs)

17:40.545 --> 17:44.345
So thought I'd come over for lunch
and hang out and...

17:46.645 --> 17:47.935
Have cake.

17:53.819 --> 17:55.819
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:57.617 --> 17:59.446
(laughing)

17:59.710 --> 18:01.664
- [Julia] Fuck you, no fucking way.

18:03.109 --> 18:05.387
That is for you gate crashing –

18:05.827 --> 18:08.363
- Your party?
- My coming out to my parents.

18:10.042 --> 18:12.116
- [Henri] Lick it off.
- [Julia] No fucking way.

18:12.545 --> 18:13.879
- [Henri] Yum, that tastes so good.

18:13.945 --> 18:15.232
- Good.

18:19.413 --> 18:20.819
Do you not like Patrick?

18:22.171 --> 18:23.405
- [Henri] I didn't say I don't like him.

18:23.471 --> 18:24.645
- You didn't seem to really

18:25.073 --> 18:28.007
describe him to my parents the way
you said you care about him.

18:28.073 --> 18:31.373
- I said he was nice. I
said he's helping you out.

18:31.975 --> 18:33.599
- When you had Skyped –
- Did you hear me say that?

18:33.665 --> 18:36.665
- Yeah. When you guys
are together on the screen,

18:37.235 --> 18:39.522
he'll leave, you're like "Heʼs so great."

18:40.450 --> 18:42.450
Where was that Henri?

18:42.711 --> 18:44.005
- It was hard with your parents.

18:44.071 --> 18:46.711
They didn't seem to be a fan.
- They need to hear that he is good.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.437
- Well, it was really awkward.

18:49.365 --> 18:51.141
- Alright.
- What now?

18:51.425 --> 18:52.588
- What now?

18:53.251 --> 18:55.420
Mum's probably outside the door, isn't she?

18:55.486 --> 18:58.086
She told you to come
in. She's like "Henri."

18:58.759 --> 19:00.000
"Henri."

19:00.374 --> 19:03.374
- "Bring her cake, make her feel better."
- She simply likes the idea of it.

19:04.285 --> 19:05.852
- Of who?
- Of this.

19:05.918 --> 19:07.034
- Of what?

19:09.817 --> 19:13.117
This is our minister who's
going to marry us. Ready?

19:13.524 --> 19:16.568
Do you Henry with an
'i' take Julia with an 'aʼ?

19:16.634 --> 19:18.777
- Shut up.
- Is that a yes?

19:19.893 --> 19:22.927
- Can you eat some cake or I'm going to eat it.
- Here's your wedding cake.

19:24.643 --> 19:26.547
- Awww.
- That's so good.

19:26.837 --> 19:27.959
- Stop it.

19:28.025 --> 19:29.373
- You going to give me a kiss?

19:29.768 --> 19:31.668
- Maybe.
- Hmm.

19:35.042 --> 19:39.158
- [Julia] I was asked to be in a polyamorous
relationship in New York before I met Patrick.

19:39.668 --> 19:42.142
- Really?
- Yep. Twice. Two different people.

19:42.374 --> 19:47.803
I started talking about the vaginas I was making
and the art forms we were doing because right.

19:48.143 --> 19:50.609
So I was describing the work that I do.

19:50.675 --> 19:53.791
And this lady is like "Oh how awesome.
Hey meet my husband."

19:54.209 --> 19:56.443
I was like "Oh hi" and
he was like "Hi, Iʼm Ted."

19:56.509 --> 19:59.934
They meet up with me a week later for coffee
and then "Look, we want to tell you something."

20:00.000 --> 20:05.560
"We practice polyamory and we'd
love for you to be our next threesome."

20:06.243 --> 20:07.355
- Wow.

20:08.283 --> 20:09.609
Sounds like a pretty good offer.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.233
- [Julia] It was a pretty good offer.

20:13.377 --> 20:15.000
She's a lawyer on Wall Street.

20:16.601 --> 20:18.061
- Millie was a lawyer.

20:18.127 --> 20:19.427
Don't need any more of them.

20:22.243 --> 20:25.603
Too structured. Just just go with the flow.

20:26.555 --> 20:31.070
- That's what I did and apparently, according to you
and my parents, I'm a piece of shit for doing that.

20:31.136 --> 20:36.829
"Go with the flow but make sure you have an
encyclopedia of what you have to do, like rules."

20:37.063 --> 20:39.263
- Go with the flow and
lying are two different things.

20:39.329 --> 20:40.625
- I didn't lie!

20:40.691 --> 20:42.401
- All right, all right, you didn't lie.

20:43.105 --> 20:46.499
- You didn't say to me ever,
"Hey Julia, are you married?"

20:46.933 --> 20:48.371
Did you?

20:49.067 --> 20:50.099
- How was I meant to –

20:50.165 --> 20:52.643
- Right. So I didn't lie to you.
- Who would ask someone if they're married?

20:52.709 --> 20:55.943
- I could be like, "Right now,
do you have constipation?"

20:56.009 --> 20:57.143
- [Henri] That is the dumbest thing.

20:57.209 --> 21:00.293
- No, really. And if you had it and
you said no then it would be a lie.

21:00.359 --> 21:03.907
But if I didn't know to ask you,
that's all that happened. So...

21:05.001 --> 21:07.993
- I didn't ask for your view.
- I didn't lie to you. We've been through this, come on!

21:08.059 --> 21:09.375
- No, itʼs fine.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.537
- I didn't lie.
- Yes, you didn't lie.

21:12.603 --> 21:14.701
- I just didn't tell you.
- Yes.

21:14.767 --> 21:17.651
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.
I wasn't ready to tell you sooner.

21:18.274 --> 21:20.874
- What made you decide to just get married?

21:21.173 --> 21:22.321
- He asked me.

21:23.357 --> 21:24.626
- [Henri] That's it?

21:26.005 --> 21:27.941
- It was fun.
- Is that how it happens?

21:28.007 --> 21:29.054
- Fuck you.

21:29.460 --> 21:33.552
He was impulsive. He was like
I've got some time this weekend.

21:33.618 --> 21:35.970
Do you want to go to Vegas? I was like,
"Yeah, let's go to Vegas!"

21:36.036 --> 21:38.218
- I've got some time this weekend!
- And when we got to Vegas,

21:38.284 --> 21:42.174
he's like "Do you want to marry me?"
I was like "Yes! That sounds great!"

21:43.215 --> 21:45.369
- So we did it.
- Seems like a pretty quick decision.

21:45.435 --> 21:47.507
- You just said follow the fucking flow.

21:47.959 --> 21:51.677
- I didn't mean to go get married.
- Yeah, follow the flow but don't do this, don't do that.

21:51.743 --> 21:53.461
Well the flow got me married!

21:54.179 --> 21:55.145
- Sure did.

21:55.211 --> 21:58.805
- I was flowing with my menstrual cycle.
- You're married and what are we doing now?

22:01.147 --> 22:02.261
- Come to bed.

22:04.137 --> 22:05.253
How are you?

22:06.313 --> 22:08.713
- [Julia] That's the question.
- [Henri] I'm good.

22:11.481 --> 22:12.939
- [Julia] This is nice.

22:45.232 --> 22:46.380
(kiss)

23:10.457 --> 23:13.418
(romantic music)

23:52.197 --> 23:54.840
(moaning)

24:06.037 --> 24:07.185
(loud moan)

24:57.951 --> 24:59.835
(grunting and moaning)

25:45.250 --> 25:47.656
(slow heavy breathing)

27:19.381 --> 27:21.315
(moaning)

27:25.608 --> 27:27.443
(sad music)

28:49.711 --> 28:50.998
(phone beep)

42:17.616 --> 42:19.807
(sad music)

43:16.142 --> 43:17.388
(moaning)

43:30.710 --> 43:32.138
(intense music)

43:47.334 --> 43:48.553
(moaning and grunting)

50:26.159 --> 50:28.349
(heartbeat and heavy breathing)

50:41.345 --> 50:43.550
(crashing waves)

51:14.299 --> 51:15.444
(wooden spoon tapping)

51:51.989 --> 51:53.627
- How was your day honey?

51:54.186 --> 51:55.728
-[Milana] It was fine.

51:55.964 --> 51:57.330
- [Rosalie] Yeah, what did you do?

51:57.396 --> 51:59.031
- Studied all day.

51:59.768 --> 52:02.174
- [Rosalie] What, exactly?
What was happening?

52:02.991 --> 52:06.420
- [Milana] Children of war
and generational violence.

52:16.843 --> 52:20.543
- You know today in
the office, it was crazy.

52:21.917 --> 52:23.317
We got a new software.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.944
And nobody is understanding it.
We are all struggling.

52:27.967 --> 52:29.467
So complicated.

52:30.337 --> 52:33.227
Do not get why we got a new system.

52:34.947 --> 52:38.935
- I'm sure you'll will be
fine baby, you're so smart.

52:41.005 --> 52:45.344
- And you know when I went home,
I saw this couple again.

52:45.410 --> 52:49.182
With the crazy hair. You know we saw
at the bar with the pink hair?

52:49.450 --> 52:52.168
- [Rosalie] They wear it all the the time like this.
- [Milana] Really?

52:52.234 --> 52:56.568
- [Rosalie] Yeah, that's crazy. You'll never
find a job like this. Not in the office.

52:58.380 --> 53:02.032
Yum... Yeah, I think it's
good, in a few minutes.

53:02.935 --> 53:06.535
So maybe, do you think...

53:06.930 --> 53:09.292
We can have a little time?

53:09.358 --> 53:10.981
- No, baby.

53:11.047 --> 53:14.144
I really have to study. I have a
test tomorrow, you know.

53:14.210 --> 53:15.795
- You sure?
- Yeah

53:16.315 --> 53:18.451
- Oh, ok. Got it.

53:30.809 --> 53:32.509
Oh, so that's your study, huh?

53:33.491 --> 53:35.391
You're studying prostitutes?

53:36.620 --> 53:37.684
- No.

53:38.315 --> 53:39.615
- [Rosalie] Good ass though.

53:40.141 --> 53:42.141
What does this say about her character?

53:42.373 --> 53:43.373
- [Milana] You tell me.

53:44.489 --> 53:45.749
I think you know best.

53:45.815 --> 53:47.115
- I think you are a dirty girl.

53:47.638 --> 53:50.630
(phone rings)

53:53.153 --> 53:55.313
- Luka?
- No.

53:55.733 --> 53:56.907
Hello.

53:58.081 --> 53:59.733
How are you?

54:10.209 --> 54:11.454
(camera click)

54:11.520 --> 54:14.064
- Is it for your Instagram,
or for Sugar Babies Online?

54:14.130 --> 54:15.246
- Instagram.

54:16.223 --> 54:17.957
I look disgusting.

54:18.023 --> 54:19.857
- You don't look disgusting.

54:19.923 --> 54:21.723
Don't say something like that.

54:22.633 --> 54:24.793
- I like this underwear
though, it's very nice colour.

54:24.981 --> 54:26.285
- It is.

54:27.561 --> 54:29.261
I think we could improve the image.

54:29.493 --> 54:30.811
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

54:31.159 --> 54:32.406
- What would you suggest?

54:33.075 --> 54:34.509
- Try again?

54:34.741 --> 54:35.987
- Okay, yeah.

54:38.017 --> 54:39.651
- And maybe like that?

54:39.717 --> 54:41.017
(laughing)

54:41.481 --> 54:42.415
(camera click)

54:42.481 --> 54:43.793
Maybe that's better?

54:44.199 --> 54:45.343
- That's much better.

54:45.409 --> 54:48.409
- People have to see that your
tits are real nice you know.

54:48.989 --> 54:50.369
- They're real.

54:50.435 --> 54:51.735
- Oh, they're real.

54:52.141 --> 54:53.418
Real tits.

54:55.100 --> 54:56.630
(giggling)

54:58.777 --> 55:00.145
They're better, aren't they?

55:01.251 --> 55:03.025
(squealing and laughing)

55:03.709 --> 55:06.806
- You can do that later.
- Whoa, do that later!

55:11.501 --> 55:12.816
(kissing and heavy breathing)

55:25.997 --> 55:27.792
- [Milana] I love it when you do that.

55:31.728 --> 55:32.844
Take that off.

55:43.318 --> 55:44.475
(heavy breathing)

55:56.381 --> 55:57.415
(laughing)

56:03.772 --> 56:05.396
- Bye bye panties.

56:08.645 --> 56:10.072
(romantic music)

56:35.078 --> 56:36.300
(moaning)

56:37.206 --> 56:38.376
(spitting)

57:23.630 --> 57:25.132
- Sweet to see how bad you are.

58:33.767 --> 58:34.999
(laughing)

58:42.622 --> 58:43.805
(phone ringing)

58:51.250 --> 58:52.704
- Luka?

58:53.400 --> 58:54.820
Is it Luka?

58:55.344 --> 58:56.960
- [Milana] Luka.

59:00.557 --> 59:01.833
Luka.

59:22.835 --> 59:24.646
(foreboding music)

59:34.441 --> 59:35.962
(dance music)

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:01.594
- [Rosalie] Hey, cutie!

1:00:04.473 --> 1:00:06.077
- How are you?
- I'm fine, how are you?

1:00:06.143 --> 1:00:07.643
- I'm good. We're almost done.

1:00:08.165 --> 1:00:09.599
- It's ok, let's hang out.

1:00:09.665 --> 1:00:11.175
- Want to have a drink?
- Yes.

1:00:17.963 --> 1:00:19.615
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:42.174
(music off)

1:00:44.123 --> 1:00:45.627
- [Rosalie] Cutie, how was your day?

1:00:45.975 --> 1:00:49.575
- You look tired.
- I am so tired. Fuck.

1:00:50.569 --> 1:00:54.200
So sick of all these men in Berlin. They
just take so much, I give so much.

1:00:55.211 --> 1:00:57.387
- Maybe you should quit.
- Yeah?

1:00:57.813 --> 1:00:59.153
- Get a normal job.

1:00:59.219 --> 1:01:00.663
- Normal job?
- Yeah.

1:01:00.729 --> 1:01:02.613
- What can I do?
- Or a job in a bar.

1:01:03.113 --> 1:01:07.199
- I know I wanted to study. I mean study and
then I want to go work, and you know this.

1:01:07.479 --> 1:01:10.297
- But you are already studying and working.

1:01:10.363 --> 1:01:11.854
- Yeah, but...
- So?

1:01:12.281 --> 1:01:16.955
- I mean work after as a psychologist.
- I thought just because you said you don't like it.

1:01:17.021 --> 1:01:18.227
- Yeah.

1:01:19.063 --> 1:01:21.038
- That's okay, cutie.

1:01:21.560 --> 1:01:23.311
- Yeah, but I mean...

1:01:24.626 --> 1:01:27.376
Luca is okay though. He's not so bad.

1:01:27.442 --> 1:01:28.551
- Okay.

1:01:29.621 --> 1:01:31.969
At least he's smart.

1:01:32.453 --> 1:01:34.169
Knows a lot about business.

1:01:36.597 --> 1:01:37.713
A lot of money.

1:01:40.723 --> 1:01:43.781
- So... what's the plan for tonight?

1:01:44.557 --> 1:01:46.810
You're tired, just go
home and have a pizza?

1:01:46.876 --> 1:01:49.470
- Rosalie, I have to tell you something.

1:01:49.536 --> 1:01:51.770
So Luca is coming to Berlin.

1:01:51.836 --> 1:01:55.952
Give me a lot of money to stay
in his villa while he's here for one week.

1:01:56.184 --> 1:01:57.300
And I said yes.

1:01:59.768 --> 1:02:01.071
- You...

1:02:02.870 --> 1:02:04.620
Staying with him one week?

1:02:05.859 --> 1:02:07.009
- [Milana] Just one week.

1:02:07.473 --> 1:02:08.545
One week only.

1:02:09.517 --> 1:02:11.042
- And you already said yes?

1:02:16.833 --> 1:02:20.493
- [Milana] I know should have, obviously
should have talked to you, but –

1:02:20.559 --> 1:02:21.859
- Yeah, obviously.

1:02:24.117 --> 1:02:25.327
- It's a lot of money.

1:02:30.549 --> 1:02:31.649
(sighs)

1:02:34.001 --> 1:02:38.401
- [Rosalie] Why didn't we talk about this before?
- [Milana] Obviously it doesn't mean anything. You know this.

1:02:39.269 --> 1:02:41.497
- So you say always, it
doesn't mean anything.

1:02:41.563 --> 1:02:43.629
- [Milana] It doesn't mean anything.
- [Rosalie] He is calling at night.

1:02:43.695 --> 1:02:47.044
- You're speaking a language I can't understand,
I don't know what the hell you are talking about.

1:02:47.110 --> 1:02:49.244
- It's work.
- He's texting every fucking –

1:02:49.310 --> 1:02:51.414
- It's work, Rosalie.
- Every fucking day, he is texting you.

1:02:51.480 --> 1:02:52.804
- It's always, always work.

1:02:52.870 --> 1:02:54.270
- It's too much

1:02:59.035 --> 1:03:03.655
I have a feeling you are spending more time
texting Luca than we are spending time together.

1:03:05.337 --> 1:03:07.529
- That's fucking ridiculous.

1:03:07.877 --> 1:03:09.761
We're together all the time.

1:03:10.543 --> 1:03:12.013
- Is it too much for you?

1:03:12.419 --> 1:03:13.779
- No.
- You want to break?

1:03:13.845 --> 1:03:15.000
- No!

1:03:17.179 --> 1:03:18.679
- Then why you do this?

1:03:21.237 --> 1:03:22.741
Why you do this, Milana?

1:03:23.321 --> 1:03:24.379
- What did I do?

1:03:24.805 --> 1:03:26.405
I need this, I need the money.

1:03:29.239 --> 1:03:31.839
We can do so much with this.

1:03:42.623 --> 1:03:44.229
- [Rosalie] So you said yes?

1:03:45.297 --> 1:03:46.866
When do you go over there?

1:03:47.910 --> 1:03:49.131
When is it?

1:03:49.197 --> 1:03:50.697
- Day after tomorrow.

1:03:58.645 --> 1:03:59.730
(sigh)

1:04:02.029 --> 1:04:03.689
- Can I ask you something?

1:04:05.941 --> 1:04:06.947
- Yes.

1:04:07.501 --> 1:04:09.333
- Are you sure you still love me?

1:04:11.067 --> 1:04:12.473
- [Rosalie] Yeah?
- [Milana] Yes.

1:04:16.499 --> 1:04:18.710
- I love you more than
I've ever loved anyone.

1:04:19.870 --> 1:04:21.079
Ever.

1:04:26.457 --> 1:04:28.057
- So you do it for one week.

1:04:29.715 --> 1:04:30.947
- [Milana] Then maybe I stop.

1:04:31.941 --> 1:04:32.973
Yeah?

1:04:34.945 --> 1:04:36.126
-Okay.

1:04:39.549 --> 1:04:42.549
One time a lot of money and then stop.

1:04:43.819 --> 1:04:45.419
I understand that.

1:04:46.377 --> 1:04:47.577
It's okay.

1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:52.539
It's okay, honey. I'll just get my stuff.

1:04:54.353 --> 1:04:55.953
I'm tired, let's go home

1:04:58.011 --> 1:04:59.311
Get a pizza.

1:05:13.764 --> 1:05:15.264
- [ Milana] It's fine,

1:05:15.571 --> 1:05:16.871
Thirty minutes, okay?

1:05:17.685 --> 1:05:19.485
I'll just have a quick shower.

1:05:20.737 --> 1:05:22.340
Okay.

1:05:23.570 --> 1:05:25.490
I am sorry Rosalie, I have
a fucking appointment.

1:05:26.927 --> 1:05:28.807
- Thought you quit?

1:05:30.627 --> 1:05:32.627
- Somebody's got to make money, right?

1:05:33.584 --> 1:05:34.884
- I'm not making money, huh?

1:05:36.565 --> 1:05:38.365
- I need to make money
for me, you know this.

1:05:39.418 --> 1:05:41.418
- That's nice, fucking strangers.

1:05:44.125 --> 1:05:45.324
- [Milana] Off to shower.

1:05:47.673 --> 1:05:49.153
- Thought we were going to eat pizza?

1:05:49.256 --> 1:05:50.590
- Yeah, we will eat pizza.

1:05:50.656 --> 1:05:52.590
- When? When?
- After I work.

1:05:52.656 --> 1:05:55.956
- Yeah, after you work. You take shower
and then you go fuck on camera.

1:05:57.112 --> 1:06:00.560
- It's not a job.
- It's a job for me.

1:06:00.626 --> 1:06:02.486
- You said you will stop after Luka.

1:06:02.803 --> 1:06:04.537
- I will stop after Luka.
- Just Luka, then stop.

1:06:04.603 --> 1:06:06.810
- I will. I will stop!
- Why take this job?

1:06:06.876 --> 1:06:08.946
- [Rosalie] You fucking addict,
you're a fucking sex addict!

1:06:09.012 --> 1:06:10.714
- I'm not a fucking sex addict!

1:06:10.780 --> 1:06:12.786
- [Rosalie] I don't know why you are doing this to me!
- [Milana] Fuck you!

1:06:12.852 --> 1:06:13.976
- Fucking cunt!

1:06:14.042 --> 1:06:15.769
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1:06:15.835 --> 1:06:17.617
- No fuck you, stop it!
- Fuck you!

1:06:17.683 --> 1:06:18.760
(door slams shut)

1:06:21.429 --> 1:06:23.782
(intense music)

1:08:09.126 --> 1:08:10.542
- I love you.

1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:16.855
- [Milana] I'm sorry.

1:08:20.793 --> 1:08:23.841

1:09:20.971 --> 1:09:23.232

1:09:26.655 --> 1:09:28.629
(crowd chatter)

1:09:38.098 --> 1:09:40.198
- Yesterday was shit.

1:09:49.559 --> 1:09:50.733
I think

1:09:51.654 --> 1:09:53.154
I, um...

1:09:55.638 --> 1:09:57.232
I got a bit emotional.

1:09:58.359 --> 1:09:59.580
It was just...

1:10:00.914 --> 1:10:02.291
A lot, you know.

1:10:02.684 --> 1:10:04.278
It's just a lot.

1:10:04.344 --> 1:10:05.696
I, um...

1:10:10.376 --> 1:10:12.676
I don't want to lose you, you know?

1:10:14.487 --> 1:10:16.087
I got worried.

1:10:21.681 --> 1:10:23.181
My cutie.

1:10:28.612 --> 1:10:30.112
You all right?

1:10:30.573 --> 1:10:31.783
- Yeah.

1:10:34.630 --> 1:10:36.631
(phone rings)

1:10:42.890 --> 1:10:45.654
No. I won't, I won't, I won't.

1:10:45.908 --> 1:10:47.348
(phone rings)

1:10:51.045 --> 1:10:53.212
- I'm here with you, okay?

1:10:53.850 --> 1:10:55.216
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1:10:55.282 --> 1:10:56.908
- [Milana] It's just us.

1:10:59.478 --> 1:11:01.854
(train horn)

1:11:04.866 --> 1:11:07.452
- Hello.
- Hello.

1:11:07.518 --> 1:11:08.764
(giggling)

1:11:09.251 --> 1:11:10.851
Do you like it?

1:11:11.138 --> 1:11:13.318
- [Client] Ah yeah.
- It's just for you.

1:11:14.069 --> 1:11:17.069
- You're making me so horny.

1:11:19.113 --> 1:11:21.523
I'm already so wet for you.

1:11:23.642 --> 1:11:25.453
(moans)

1:11:29.473 --> 1:11:31.473
I'm so wet for you.

1:11:38.292 --> 1:11:40.708
- [Milana] Such a dirty old man.

1:11:48.844 --> 1:11:50.022
(giggling)

1:11:51.786 --> 1:11:54.086
- Two lesbians are better than one.

1:12:01.798 --> 1:12:04.162
(fake giggling)

1:12:04.626 --> 1:12:06.104
(panting)

1:12:06.876 --> 1:12:08.176
- Do you love this?

1:12:08.463 --> 1:12:10.903
- Tell me how much you love this, Milana?

1:12:12.461 --> 1:12:15.551
- Stopping after Luka? What the
fuck are you doing to me?

1:12:16.101 --> 1:12:18.135
Why you are always doing this to me?

1:12:18.201 --> 1:12:22.401
I'm fed up with it! You said
you stop! You said you quit!

1:12:22.928 --> 1:12:24.251
(Milana whimpering)

1:12:26.655 --> 1:12:29.037
- Tell me you stop.
- I didn't. I didn't.

1:12:29.517 --> 1:12:31.334
(Milana crying)

1:12:36.498 --> 1:12:38.271
- Crying little baby.

1:12:38.337 --> 1:12:39.673
- Your such a –
- What!

1:12:40.358 --> 1:12:43.668
- I'm such a what? You are the slut!
Look in the mirror!

1:12:44.275 --> 1:12:47.649
- [Milana] You control me all the time.
You suffocate me all the time.

1:12:47.715 --> 1:12:49.615
I can't even breathe with you.

1:12:49.681 --> 1:12:53.051
- So, I let you fuck with the whole
world? And just like, I don't care!

1:12:54.061 --> 1:12:55.235
I don't care.

1:12:59.095 --> 1:13:01.627
(screaming)

1:13:02.909 --> 1:13:04.793
(heavy breathing)

1:13:06.313 --> 1:13:08.113
You're not sorry at all, are you?

1:13:08.179 --> 1:13:09.722
- I'm sorry.

1:13:12.128 --> 1:13:13.880
You're such a bitch!

1:13:15.325 --> 1:13:17.685
- Ha, I am the bitch?
You're serious, I'm the bitch?

1:13:17.751 --> 1:13:18.959
- You're the bitch.

1:13:19.025 --> 1:13:23.083
- You're serious? Tell me who
is the bitch? Who is it?

1:13:23.424 --> 1:13:25.402
Who is fucking guys? Who is it?

1:13:25.468 --> 1:13:27.672
- Fuck you.
- Who is it? Is it me or is it you?

1:13:28.573 --> 1:13:30.407
(heavy breathing)

1:13:30.473 --> 1:13:32.647
- Tell me? Tell me Milana.

1:13:35.075 --> 1:13:37.475
Who's the slut? Is it me?

1:13:39.032 --> 1:13:40.614
Am I the sex addict?

1:13:40.680 --> 1:13:42.322
(crying)

1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.606
- Why do you treat me like this?

1:13:48.196 --> 1:13:51.292
Why you still with me if
you treat me like this?

1:13:51.777 --> 1:13:55.145
Why do you love me?

1:13:57.420 --> 1:14:00.000
(sobbing)

1:14:11.690 --> 1:14:13.183
- [Rosalie] I'm fed up!

1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:15.281
Fucking whore!

1:14:15.347 --> 1:14:16.747
- Fuck you

1:14:20.636 --> 1:14:23.396
(whimpering)

1:14:42.577 --> 1:14:44.977
- [Milana] So Luka has car outside.

1:14:50.666 --> 1:14:52.626
I wonder what the villa will be like?

1:14:54.447 --> 1:14:56.147
Maybe they'll be a jacuzzi.

1:15:00.459 --> 1:15:03.959
So I shouldn't be gone
for too long, a week at most.

1:15:14.071 --> 1:15:16.821
Okay, so...

1:15:17.151 --> 1:15:19.250
I'm leaving.

1:15:20.416 --> 1:15:22.175
Do you want to say bye?

1:15:23.644 --> 1:15:24.763
- Sure.

1:15:47.460 --> 1:15:48.539
(kiss)

1:15:55.701 --> 1:15:56.989
- [Rosalie] Goodbye.

1:16:04.647 --> 1:16:06.613
(kissing and moaning)

1:16:08.817 --> 1:16:10.616
(romantic music)

1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.700
- I missed you so much.

1:16:21.493 --> 1:16:22.783
- Me too.

1:16:31.138 --> 1:16:32.582
(kissing)

1:16:47.551 --> 1:16:48.609
(chuckles)

1:16:49.537 --> 1:16:50.797
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:17:15.677 --> 1:17:17.035
- Where are you going?

1:17:19.135 --> 1:17:21.135
Come back to bed. Tell me about your trip.

1:17:26.635 --> 1:17:28.535
- Umm, I guess.

1:17:30.348 --> 1:17:32.600
We had a party with friends.

1:17:33.367 --> 1:17:35.567
We had a surprise party.

1:17:35.993 --> 1:17:37.167
- For you?
- Yeah. It was fun.

1:17:37.832 --> 1:17:39.476
- That's cool. Were your parents there?

1:17:39.542 --> 1:17:42.354
- No, it was just my friends. Z was there.
So it was nice to see her.

1:17:42.420 --> 1:17:44.016
- Z?
- Zara.

1:17:47.140 --> 1:17:48.651
- But you talked to your parents?

1:17:49.584 --> 1:17:51.109
- Yeah, I...

1:17:51.979 --> 1:17:53.109
I don't think I'll be …

1:17:54.417 --> 1:17:56.617
I don't think I'll be talking to
them again for a while.

1:17:57.017 --> 1:17:58.023
- Why?

1:18:00.243 --> 1:18:02.843
- They don't like that I'm
here and that I am married.

1:18:03.677 --> 1:18:06.411
- I gave them the painting –
- So it's the whole package?

1:18:06.477 --> 1:18:07.567
- I guess.

1:18:08.219 --> 1:18:09.566
- Well, I mean...

1:18:11.248 --> 1:18:13.573
They love you, right? They'll come around.

1:18:14.385 --> 1:18:17.153
- They want you to be happy, right?
- Hey, I need to...

1:18:18.571 --> 1:18:20.105
I need to tell you something.

1:18:21.347 --> 1:18:22.947
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:18:23.899 --> 1:18:25.250
- So...

1:18:26.178 --> 1:18:29.934
I want you to know before I
tell you that I want you to

1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:32.078
trust that I...

1:18:32.600 --> 1:18:34.136
I love you.

1:18:37.334 --> 1:18:41.454
I'm so happy to be your
wife and be with you.

1:18:42.595 --> 1:18:44.934
- Good.
- Make art and create.

1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:46.710
- So far so good.

1:18:48.259 --> 1:18:50.059
- But when we met,

1:18:51.534 --> 1:18:56.214
you said you loved me for who
I was and you knew who I was and

1:18:56.678 --> 1:18:59.032
my identity,

1:18:59.098 --> 1:19:01.088
my connection to soul and body.

1:19:04.853 --> 1:19:07.623
I've never found someone
that I've just wanted to

1:19:08.289 --> 1:19:10.023
just be with, just you.

1:19:10.089 --> 1:19:11.521
But I...

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:16.448
(sad music)

1:19:17.065 --> 1:19:19.865
I made a mistake. And I'm sorry.

1:19:22.117 --> 1:19:23.349
I'm sorry.

1:19:26.007 --> 1:19:28.601
- What are you talking about?
You made a mistake?

1:19:28.667 --> 1:19:30.261
Tell me what you're talking about?

1:19:30.327 --> 1:19:32.327
- I slept with Henri in Melbourne.

1:19:32.559 --> 1:19:34.159
- Henri in Melbourne?
- Yeah.

1:19:35.817 --> 1:19:37.761
- It was just one time.
- Henri, your friend?

1:19:37.827 --> 1:19:40.817
- Yeah, he's been a
friend for a long time and

1:19:41.275 --> 1:19:43.875
we've had a connection
for a very long time.

1:19:49.059 --> 1:19:50.291
Hey.

1:19:53.333 --> 1:19:55.818
I'm really sorry that I didn't tell you.

1:19:56.883 --> 1:19:59.227
Before it happened.

1:20:00.259 --> 1:20:01.577
I mean that.

1:20:02.853 --> 1:20:04.041
Babe?

1:20:06.826 --> 1:20:08.031
Baby?

1:20:14.443 --> 1:20:16.283
It's me. I'm still the...

1:20:16.689 --> 1:20:17.789
same person.

1:20:18.859 --> 1:20:20.359
- You know like...

1:20:21.949 --> 1:20:25.949
I'm like a virgin in this kind of thing,
right? You know that like I'm a virgin?

1:20:26.356 --> 1:20:27.598
Right?

1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:32.034
You're my first time with
this kind of thing, right?

1:20:32.100 --> 1:20:34.100
- I know, I know that and I...

1:20:35.243 --> 1:20:36.452
- And we set up...

1:20:37.458 --> 1:20:39.450
- You set up...
- Yeah.

1:20:40.472 --> 1:20:41.951
- Protocols.
- Yeah.

1:20:42.017 --> 1:20:43.667
- For what?
- Yes.

1:20:46.319 --> 1:20:50.087
- I've never wanted to...

1:20:50.377 --> 1:20:52.095
I've never not wanted to …

1:20:52.419 --> 1:20:56.353
I've never only wanted to
experience you or someone

1:20:56.419 --> 1:20:59.113
for the amount of time that
I have... that I've been with you.

1:20:59.179 --> 1:21:01.005
- Well, you haven't.

1:21:01.251 --> 1:21:03.005
You haven't.

1:21:03.295 --> 1:21:04.501
- What do you mean?

1:21:04.567 --> 1:21:08.085
- Well, you haven't only experienced me,
now Henri is part of the picture.

1:21:08.151 --> 1:21:10.385
- He's not part of the
picture. It was a one-off thing.

1:21:10.451 --> 1:21:14.185
- Well, right now, in my picture,

1:21:14.251 --> 1:21:16.115
he is part of the picture.

1:21:16.181 --> 1:21:17.833
- Okay.
- Because that is my picture.

1:21:17.899 --> 1:21:21.470
I know that you've had time, right?
I don't know, when did this happen?

1:21:21.536 --> 1:21:24.036
- It was once. It was one time with –

1:21:24.403 --> 1:21:27.133
- When? Like when you started,
at the middle, at the end?

1:21:27.199 --> 1:21:31.250
- Did you get bored? Did you –
- I didn't get bored. It's not about being bored.

1:21:31.731 --> 1:21:33.379
It's about connection.

1:21:33.901 --> 1:21:35.692
And that's who I was when you married me.

1:21:35.758 --> 1:21:38.770
- So, I didn't call enough?
- No.

1:21:38.836 --> 1:21:41.454
- Or you weren't feeling our connection?

1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:43.114
- No, I felt our connection still.

1:21:43.180 --> 1:21:45.514
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
before it happened. I mean that.

1:21:45.580 --> 1:21:47.414
I know that was our deal. I'm sorry.

1:21:47.480 --> 1:21:49.183
I want to be able to do
that for you in the future.

1:21:49.249 --> 1:21:51.183
- I really do –
- I know, I know, I know you're sorry.

1:21:51.249 --> 1:21:53.450
I can't hear you say that right now.

1:21:53.914 --> 1:21:55.392
I've heard you say it.

1:21:55.953 --> 1:21:57.277
- It happened...

1:21:58.554 --> 1:22:00.348
at my parent's place.

1:22:02.349 --> 1:22:03.703
- Where were they?

1:22:03.769 --> 1:22:07.169
- They were... They
had invited him for dinner.

1:22:07.892 --> 1:22:09.900
- They were home?
- Yeah.

1:22:11.255 --> 1:22:13.855
- And you and Henri
were in the same bedroom?

1:22:14.145 --> 1:22:17.367
- I don't know. My mum –
- You don't know? You don't know?

1:22:17.433 --> 1:22:19.433
- We had a huge fight. I hadn't –

1:22:19.803 --> 1:22:20.937
- Who had a huge fight?

1:22:21.003 --> 1:22:22.937
Me and my parents had a fight.

1:22:23.003 --> 1:22:26.937
- You fought and you didn't know which
bedroom you were in because you were fighting.

1:22:27.003 --> 1:22:28.437
- No, I was in my room.

1:22:28.503 --> 1:22:32.037
- You were in your room. And Henri was in the room.
- He came in.

1:22:32.103 --> 1:22:34.537
- He came in. So he was somewhere
else and he came in.

1:22:34.603 --> 1:22:37.755
- He offered me a piece of cake and –

1:22:38.871 --> 1:22:41.705
- And a little more
than cake it sounds like.

1:22:44.547 --> 1:22:45.852
- Okay.

1:22:48.521 --> 1:22:50.521
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

1:22:51.573 --> 1:22:52.997
And I know it's tough.

1:22:53.063 --> 1:22:55.663
And I won't say that 's'
word again, but I really...

1:23:01.857 --> 1:23:03.229
I love you.

1:23:03.295 --> 1:23:04.585
- I love you too.

1:23:06.727 --> 1:23:08.126
I love you too.

1:23:21.029 --> 1:23:22.529
- This is new for me too.

1:23:30.877 --> 1:23:32.077
Baby?

1:23:33.179 --> 1:23:34.394
(Patrick sighs)

1:23:55.668 --> 1:23:56.917
Hey?

1:24:12.388 --> 1:24:13.684
(footsteps)

1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:16.022
- Good Morning.

1:24:16.354 --> 1:24:17.644
- Morning.

1:24:18.013 --> 1:24:19.576
Do you want some of this?

1:24:20.477 --> 1:24:22.077
- No, I am okay. Thanks.

1:24:23.009 --> 1:24:25.614
- I'm sure you are okay. I just wanted
to know if you wanted some coffee.

1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:27.909
- That alright?
- That's fine. Yeah

1:24:27.975 --> 1:24:30.114
- I got most of it, so if you
want some later.

1:24:31.199 --> 1:24:32.727
So, listen, what you got on today?

1:24:33.343 --> 1:24:34.903
- I have a meeting for that commission.

1:24:35.964 --> 1:24:37.586
- Which commission?

1:24:38.224 --> 1:24:40.291
- The one for the parks.

1:24:40.639 --> 1:24:41.848
- Yes?
- Yeah

1:24:41.914 --> 1:24:43.767
- Thank you. Which parks?

1:24:44.605 --> 1:24:46.012
- The murals for the parks.

1:24:46.078 --> 1:24:47.234
(phone vibrating)

1:24:47.300 --> 1:24:49.533
- [Patrick] Oh, right. That's
great. Awesome.

1:24:49.599 --> 1:24:52.894
I've got to get over to Carol's to
give her the spare set of keys.

1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:54.995
Do you know where they are?
(phone vibrating)

1:24:55.352 --> 1:24:57.423
I thought you used them last time.

1:24:58.410 --> 1:25:00.000
- Wasn't it you? Okay.
- No.

1:25:00.212 --> 1:25:01.719
- They're not here.
- Alright.

1:25:01.785 --> 1:25:03.218
- Fuck! What am I going to do?

1:25:04.892 --> 1:25:06.732
Do you know what time
the hardware store opens?

1:25:07.758 --> 1:25:09.544
- No.
(phone message beep)

1:25:10.489 --> 1:25:11.605
- You gonna get that?

1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:13.073
- No, it's alright.

1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.000
- Look, if you want to talk
to your friend.

1:25:18.060 --> 1:25:20.460
- It's fine. He can leave
a message or whatever.

1:25:20.939 --> 1:25:23.539
- Well, you can check the
message. See if he left one.

1:25:23.935 --> 1:25:28.255
I am open with it. This is an open
relationship, right? So I am open to it.

1:25:28.727 --> 1:25:30.000
- Fine.

1:25:31.395 --> 1:25:35.364
- [Henri] Hey, Jules. Just checking in to
see how the preps going for your exhibition.

1:25:35.430 --> 1:25:36.995
Hope it's all going well.

1:25:37.061 --> 1:25:38.525
No doubt you're very busy.

1:25:38.591 --> 1:25:40.891
Yeah, give me a call back
when you got a sec.

1:25:41.259 --> 1:25:42.807
Chat to you soon. Bye.

1:25:44.668 --> 1:25:46.008
- Got a sec?

1:25:46.074 --> 1:25:48.500
- [Julia] No. I said
I will call back later.

1:25:51.828 --> 1:25:53.292
- Okay, Jules.

1:25:54.554 --> 1:25:55.928
- Thanks, Patrick.

1:25:57.646 --> 1:25:59.934
- [Patrick] Alright, I'm going to go.
- [Julia] Okay

1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:01.874
- Bye.
- Bye.

1:26:22.812 --> 1:26:24.048
(footsteps)

1:26:25.142 --> 1:26:26.918
- Hello.
- Hi.

1:26:31.121 --> 1:26:32.962
(phone slapped down)
- Damn it.

1:26:36.844 --> 1:26:38.044
- What's...

1:26:43.119 --> 1:26:44.264
- [Julia] What's going on?

1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:47.503
- I'm checking my email,
that's what's going on.

1:26:48.760 --> 1:26:49.940
- Okay.

1:26:50.611 --> 1:26:51.809
- [ Patrick] No, Michael.

1:26:52.433 --> 1:26:53.793
- [Julia] I'm Julia.

1:26:55.693 --> 1:26:57.193
- Oh my God! It's Julia.

1:26:58.007 --> 1:27:00.171
Yeah, I know. I'm talking to Michael.

1:27:00.237 --> 1:27:02.307
Michael seems to think that
the opening is happening

1:27:02.637 --> 1:27:04.571
on a Friday instead of a Thursday.

1:27:04.637 --> 1:27:07.637
- What the fuck?
- Yeah, the fuck. Exactly.

1:27:07.903 --> 1:27:09.367
- Oh, what?

1:27:10.805 --> 1:27:13.043
- [Julia] Do we need to –
how do we change that?

1:27:13.109 --> 1:27:15.739
- People have to come on Thursday.
- We don't have to do anything.

1:27:15.805 --> 1:27:19.349
I am just sharing with you
because we share a privileged overlap.

1:27:19.415 --> 1:27:21.439
A Venn diagram of reality, right?

1:27:21.505 --> 1:27:23.665
So, I am just sharing with you. That's all.

1:27:23.731 --> 1:27:26.497
- Do I need to –
- No, you don't have to do a thing except make your art.

1:27:26.563 --> 1:27:28.729
- That's very nice, by the way.
- My art's made, thank you.

1:27:28.795 --> 1:27:31.302
I am just chilling out.
I am just doing this to chill out.

1:27:32.001 --> 1:27:33.830
- I hung everything this morning.
- Ok, I'm glad you're chill.

1:27:33.896 --> 1:27:36.621
- Yeah I am.
- So be chill. That's cool.

1:27:37.480 --> 1:27:39.405
(phone message beep)
- [Julia] I am chill.

1:27:39.471 --> 1:27:43.722
- Oh my God, Sheila, no! Fuck.

1:27:45.318 --> 1:27:46.588
(sigh)

1:27:48.644 --> 1:27:51.564
No, just do what you do. Be brilliant.

1:27:51.854 --> 1:27:53.086
Be beautiful.

1:27:55.399 --> 1:27:58.705
Be attractive. You're going to attract
all these new people to your work,

1:27:58.771 --> 1:27:59.934
it's going to be great.

1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:01.500
- Okay. Thanks Patrick.

1:28:01.955 --> 1:28:03.045
Cool.

1:28:03.424 --> 1:28:04.852
- Are you –
- How did Michael get the day wrong?

1:28:04.918 --> 1:28:06.424
How did that happen?

1:28:07.878 --> 1:28:10.878
- I think he was dropped as a baby.

1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:13.040
I think that's how he got the day wrong.

1:28:13.217 --> 1:28:15.751
I think that that's the only way
he could have gotten a day wrong,

1:28:15.817 --> 1:28:18.263
because from the beginning,
we've been saying Thursday.

1:28:18.817 --> 1:28:21.251
The Gallery always does
their openings on a Thursday.

1:28:21.317 --> 1:28:22.751
That's how we've done every opening.

1:28:22.817 --> 1:28:24.626
That's how every opening
I've ever gone and I haven't been a part

1:28:24.692 --> 1:28:26.626
of has gone at this gallery,
but for some reason,

1:28:26.692 --> 1:28:28.692
this guy thought we were
doing it on a Friday.

1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:31.634
I don't know. I have no idea.

1:28:31.700 --> 1:28:34.491
Maybe he doesn't like Thor, I don't know.

1:28:36.619 --> 1:28:38.740
(phone message beep)
- [Julia] Oh my God!

1:28:40.379 --> 1:28:41.779
Hey Z!

1:28:45.418 --> 1:28:46.984
(chuckles)

1:28:47.258 --> 1:28:49.010
- Zara's coming to town, she made it.

1:28:49.615 --> 1:28:51.622
Love you babe.

1:28:52.086 --> 1:28:53.622
See you tomorrow.

1:28:57.501 --> 1:28:58.766
- Thanks babe.

1:28:59.223 --> 1:29:01.303
- [Julia] For what?
- [Patrick] I love you too, babe.

1:29:01.905 --> 1:29:03.450
- Are you making fun of me?

1:29:03.841 --> 1:29:07.457
- [Patrick] No, you said I love you babe,
right? I'm just saying I love you too babe.

1:29:08.527 --> 1:29:09.727
- I was texting Z.

1:29:11.443 --> 1:29:12.677
- [Patrick] I saw you were texting Z.

1:29:12.743 --> 1:29:15.477
But you said, I love you babe
so I thought maybe you're talking to me.

1:29:15.543 --> 1:29:18.031
So, I said I love you too, babe.
I was just, you know -

1:29:18.097 --> 1:29:20.727
- [Julia] I do love you, but I was texting
Z that I'm excited to see her tomorrow.

1:29:20.793 --> 1:29:22.472
She's going to come into town
and see the exhibition.

1:29:22.538 --> 1:29:24.208
She's here for the opening.

1:29:24.274 --> 1:29:25.490
- [Patrick] The opening?
- Yeah.

1:29:25.556 --> 1:29:26.755
- She's here for your opening?

1:29:26.821 --> 1:29:28.000
Is that what you're saying?

1:29:30.348 --> 1:29:31.435
- Okay.
(Patrick laughs)

1:29:31.501 --> 1:29:32.907
- [Julia] That's hilarious.

1:29:33.608 --> 1:29:35.864
- Yeah, it's hilarious.
- Yeah.

1:29:37.493 --> 1:29:39.119
(sigh)

1:29:42.301 --> 1:29:43.374
(phone slammed down)

1:29:47.870 --> 1:29:50.044
- [Julia VO] Thanks for meeting up today.

1:29:50.110 --> 1:29:53.118
I know you are busy,
doing whatever you're doing.

1:29:53.184 --> 1:29:56.688
- [Zara VO] I'm busy?
- [Julia VO] Yeah, you're signing up for courses and shit.

1:29:56.754 --> 1:29:59.254
- [Zara VO] Yeah, but tell
me about the exhibition.

1:29:59.560 --> 1:30:00.727
- [Julia] You gonna come?

1:30:00.793 --> 1:30:03.533
- Well, I don't know.
Maybe not the opening, but...

1:30:03.599 --> 1:30:05.111
I'll definitely come see it.

1:30:05.177 --> 1:30:06.995
- What the fuck? Not at the opening?

1:30:07.061 --> 1:30:08.655
- Well, I don't want to be there...
- Z!

1:30:08.721 --> 1:30:12.375
- Well, isn't it going to weird
with that Patrick guy? Stop.

1:30:13.327 --> 1:30:16.627
- Why do you call him that Patrick guy?
What's that about?

1:30:16.918 --> 1:30:19.941
- Well, isn't he that guy,
the guy of the moment?

1:30:20.007 --> 1:30:21.348
And his name is Patrick.

1:30:21.414 --> 1:30:24.155
- Is it because it is a guy, is
that why you are pissed off?

1:30:24.221 --> 1:30:25.521
- No.
- Is that why?

1:30:28.062 --> 1:30:29.934
- Is that new?
- Stop it!

1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:31.352
- [Julia] Is that new?

1:30:31.418 --> 1:30:32.712
- [Zara] Yeah, it is, that is new.

1:30:32.778 --> 1:30:34.664
And while we are talking about new things,

1:30:34.730 --> 1:30:36.762
why don't you want to tell me about this?

1:30:39.783 --> 1:30:41.443
- Yeah, we got married.

1:30:45.259 --> 1:30:47.559
We got married, Z.

1:30:48.255 --> 1:30:49.353
- Wait, so –

1:30:49.419 --> 1:30:50.871
- We got married before –
-Wait, wait, wait –

1:30:50.937 --> 1:30:52.233
So...

1:30:54.476 --> 1:30:56.303
You and Patrick.

1:30:56.739 --> 1:30:58.824
- Got married?
- Uh-huh.

1:31:01.732 --> 1:31:03.638
It felt right. You know,

1:31:03.704 --> 1:31:06.635
he likes me the way I am.
He understands me.

1:31:06.701 --> 1:31:10.503
He gets it. He thinks that it's
great that I am so clear

1:31:10.569 --> 1:31:14.129
about my communicating and my
feelings and why I want to be –

1:31:14.361 --> 1:31:16.661
- Wait, go back. Why?

1:31:17.461 --> 1:31:20.461
So you were married before
you came to Melbourne?

1:31:23.419 --> 1:31:24.599
- [Julia] Um, yeah.

1:31:25.434 --> 1:31:28.738
- And you didn't tell anyone?
- I didn't tell anyone.

1:31:29.595 --> 1:31:32.495
I didn't know how to bring it up
with mum and dad and...

1:31:33.751 --> 1:31:36.973
I hadn't really seen you in
so long and you were...

1:31:38.353 --> 1:31:40.687
I mean you weren't over
joyed when I left –

1:31:40.753 --> 1:31:43.377
- [Zara] Yeah.
- [Julia] for New York so I...

1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:46.406
I didn't know how you would take it.

1:31:46.472 --> 1:31:48.652
I didn't know what it would mean.

1:31:50.187 --> 1:31:52.375
- [Julia] Z, I'm sorry that I didn't share.

1:31:52.441 --> 1:31:53.729
- It's fine, it's...

1:31:54.481 --> 1:31:55.866
Congratulations.

1:31:55.932 --> 1:31:57.918
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1:31:58.904 --> 1:32:00.280
- Well, I...

1:32:01.086 --> 1:32:03.319
- So how's it going –
- I don't know.

1:32:03.385 --> 1:32:05.783
- This married life?
- I don't know how married life is going.

1:32:05.849 --> 1:32:08.379
I don't know because he's
not really talking to me.

1:32:11.031 --> 1:32:12.263
- Why?

1:32:15.501 --> 1:32:18.905
- I slept with Henri. In Melbourne and

1:32:18.971 --> 1:32:22.133
I thought that
- Oh my God.

1:32:22.199 --> 1:32:24.653
- Patrick would understand if I...

1:32:25.929 --> 1:32:27.929
just told him the truth.

1:32:28.917 --> 1:32:30.000
- Wait.

1:32:30.623 --> 1:32:32.745
- He's not been the same, he's not
been the same for a while.

1:32:32.811 --> 1:32:34.509
And I don't know who
to tell. Who do I tell?

1:32:34.575 --> 1:32:36.279
All my friends are his friends.

1:32:36.345 --> 1:32:39.821
Who do I explain it to, and
what happens if happens again?

1:32:41.851 --> 1:32:44.934
Our deal was that I would always
let him know before I had

1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:46.936
a desire or and I've found someone –

1:32:47.002 --> 1:32:48.769
- Yeah, but you were selfish

1:32:48.835 --> 1:32:51.203
and you decided to get married

1:32:51.269 --> 1:32:53.685
and then come to Melbourne
and sleep with Henri and not tell him –

1:32:53.751 --> 1:32:56.685
- Whoah, whoah, I didn't decide to do that.

1:32:56.751 --> 1:32:59.399
You know that's not how it works.

1:32:59.465 --> 1:33:01.334
- No, I think I do know how it works.

1:33:01.400 --> 1:33:03.700
You choose to sleep with
somebody, it is a choice.

1:33:03.766 --> 1:33:05.062
- It is not a choice!

1:33:05.128 --> 1:33:07.222
What part of that do you not understand?

1:33:07.570 --> 1:33:08.894
You've never got that.

1:33:08.960 --> 1:33:11.654
You've never like actually stopped to reflect
and to listen to what I am saying ever.

1:33:11.720 --> 1:33:14.122
- Yeah because it's all about what
you're saying and how you're feeling.

1:33:14.188 --> 1:33:16.867
How do you not think about anybody else
in these relationships that you have?

1:33:16.933 --> 1:33:18.933
- Yeah, I'm a selfish
bitch. You're totally right.

1:33:21.917 --> 1:33:23.597
- Well, what does Patrick think of it all?

1:33:25.077 --> 1:33:27.855
- [Julia] I told you, he's not really
communicating with me.

1:33:29.315 --> 1:33:32.409
He hasn't really looked at me properly.

1:33:32.693 --> 1:33:35.573
Like he makes stupid comments about sex.

1:33:35.863 --> 1:33:38.416
God I can't even get a
text message from you

1:33:38.482 --> 1:33:40.251
without him saying something...

1:33:40.317 --> 1:33:42.955
perverse and stupid and...

1:33:44.043 --> 1:33:45.603
I don't know what it means.

1:33:45.951 --> 1:33:48.473
I don't know if we stay together.
I don't know if he'll understand,

1:33:48.539 --> 1:33:52.039
I don't know.

1:33:52.577 --> 1:33:55.119
And I do know that I am gonna want to

1:33:55.185 --> 1:33:57.475
be with someone else at
some point of time, and –

1:33:57.541 --> 1:33:58.827
- So then why did you get married?

1:33:58.893 --> 1:34:01.554
- Because he understood that, he doesn't
have any issue with that, or so he says.

1:34:01.620 --> 1:34:03.494
- Well, obviously he does.

1:34:03.560 --> 1:34:05.719
This is why it doesn't work, Jules.

1:34:05.785 --> 1:34:07.600
I have told you this so many times.

1:34:07.666 --> 1:34:09.739
I get it, I get it, I get it.

1:34:09.805 --> 1:34:12.714
I just don't understand
how you don't understand.

1:34:12.780 --> 1:34:14.264
- I do understand.

1:34:14.612 --> 1:34:17.262
I understand that I should have
told him before it happened.

1:34:17.328 --> 1:34:20.972
I understand that it happened organically
because we have a connection.

1:34:21.038 --> 1:34:23.836
And that is who I am
and it's to follow that.

1:34:23.902 --> 1:34:25.545
- It's not who you are.

1:34:25.611 --> 1:34:27.865
- I get that you are so
loving and generous –

1:34:27.931 --> 1:34:32.815
- It's not about being loving, it's about choosing
my sexual consent and the people I am with.

1:34:32.881 --> 1:34:36.052
- Exactly. Choosing. It's a choice
that you are making.

1:34:36.118 --> 1:34:38.209
I just think you are kidding yourself.

1:34:38.847 --> 1:34:40.827
I just think you are lying. I think that

1:34:41.541 --> 1:34:43.083
when you are in a
relationship with somebody,

1:34:43.149 --> 1:34:46.083
there is this vulnerability
that you need to have,

1:34:46.149 --> 1:34:48.905
which is just so precious and beautiful.

1:34:48.971 --> 1:34:51.544
And when you jeopardise that, Jules,

1:34:51.892 --> 1:34:54.323
all the time. It just...

1:34:55.570 --> 1:34:57.398
I just don't get it.
