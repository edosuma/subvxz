NARRATOR: <i>"I call Heaven and Earth</i>

00:48.178 --> 00:50.840

01:11.401 --> 01:14.427
SAGAN: <i>Nearly 200 years ago,</i>
<i>in the Gulf of Alaska...</i>

01:14.637 --> 01:16.468
<i>... at a place called Lituya Bay...</i>

01:16.673 --> 01:21.576
<i>... two cultures that had never</i>
<i>met experienced a first encounter.</i>

01:22.345 --> 01:23.539
<i>The Tlingit people...</i>

01:23.747 --> 01:27.080
<i>... lived more or less as their</i>
<i>ancestors had for thousands of years.</i>

01:27.283 --> 01:28.375
<i>They were nomads...</i>

01:28.585 --> 01:31.554
<i>... moving often by canoe</i>
<i>between numerous campsites...</i>

01:31.755 --> 01:34.451
<i>... where they caught plentiful</i>
<i>fish and sea otters...</i>

01:34.657 --> 01:36.818
<i>... and traded with neighboring tribes.</i>

01:41.464 --> 01:45.230
(SPEAKS IN TLINGIT)

01:45.835 --> 01:48.565
<i>The creator they worshiped</i>
<i>was the raven god...</i>

01:48.772 --> 01:52.299
<i>... whom they pictured as an enormous</i>
<i>black bird with white wings.</i>

01:52.509 --> 01:55.000
<i>And one July day in 1786...</i>

01:55.311 --> 01:57.506
<i>... the raven god appeared.</i>

02:00.950 --> 02:02.747
<i>The Tlingit were terrified.</i>

02:02.952 --> 02:07.616
<i>They knew that anyone looking directly</i>
<i>at the god would be turned to stone.</i>

02:15.298 --> 02:18.426
<i>From the other side of the planet</i>
<i>had come an expedition...</i>

02:18.635 --> 02:21.160
<i>... led by the French</i>
<i>explorer La Pérouse.</i>

02:21.371 --> 02:26.308
<i>It was the most elaborately planned</i>
<i>scientific voyage of the century...</i>

02:26.543 --> 02:30.104
<i>... sent around the world to gather</i>
<i>knowledge about the geography...</i>

02:30.313 --> 02:33.680
<i>... natural history and peoples</i>
<i>of distant lands.</i>

02:38.388 --> 02:39.753
<i>But to the Tlingit...</i>

02:39.956 --> 02:44.450
<i>... whose world was confined to the</i>
<i>islands and inlets of south Alaska...</i>

02:44.661 --> 02:49.098
<i>... this great vessel could have</i>
<i>come only from the gods.</i>

02:53.870 --> 02:57.772
<i>There was one among them who</i>
<i>dared to look more deeply.</i>

02:57.974 --> 03:00.704
<i>He was an old warrior,</i>
<i>and nearly blind.</i>

03:01.177 --> 03:03.873
<i>He said that his life</i>
<i>was almost over.</i>

03:04.080 --> 03:06.776
<i>For the common good, he would</i>
<i>approach the raven...</i>

03:06.983 --> 03:11.920
<i>... to learn whether the god really</i>
<i>would turn his people to stone.</i>

03:26.436 --> 03:29.928
<i>He set out on his own</i>
<i>voyage of discovery...</i>

03:30.273 --> 03:33.504
<i>... to confront the end of the world.</i>

04:41.511 --> 04:45.003
<i>The old man made himself</i>
<i>look hard at the raven...</i>

04:45.214 --> 04:48.342
<i>... and saw that it was not a
<i>great bird from the sky...</i></i>

04:48.551 --> 04:51.384
<i>... but the work of men like himself.</i>

04:56.225 --> 04:59.422
<i>This first encounter turned</i>
<i>out to be peaceful.</i>

04:59.629 --> 05:02.723
<i>Men of the La Pérouse expedition</i>
<i>were under orders...</i>

05:02.932 --> 05:06.333
<i>... to treat with respect</i>
<i>any people they might discover.</i>

05:06.536 --> 05:10.165
<i>An exceptional policy</i>
<i>for its time, and after.</i>

05:10.373 --> 05:13.035
<i>La Pérouse and the Tlingit</i>
<i>exchanged goods...</i>

05:13.242 --> 05:17.872
<i>... and then the strange ship</i>
<i>sailed away, never to return.</i>

05:19.015 --> 05:23.315
<i>Not all encounters between nations</i>
<i>had been so peaceful.</i>

05:24.387 --> 05:26.355
<i>Before 1519...</i>

05:26.556 --> 05:28.956
<i>... the Aztecs of Mexico had</i>
<i>never seen a gun.</i>

05:29.158 --> 05:32.093
<i>They too believed at first</i>
<i>that their strange visitors...</i>

05:32.295 --> 05:34.388
<i>... had come from the sky.</i>

05:47.877 --> 05:49.538
<i>The Spaniards under Cortez...</i>

05:49.746 --> 05:52.715
<i>... were not constrained by</i>
<i>any injunctions against violence.</i>

05:52.915 --> 05:56.874
<i>Their true nature and intentions</i>
<i>soon became clear.</i>

06:12.435 --> 06:14.335
<i>Unlike the La Pérouse expedition...</i>

06:14.537 --> 06:18.268
<i>... the Conquistadors sought,</i>
<i>not knowledge, but gold.</i>

06:18.975 --> 06:22.638
<i>They used their superior weapons</i>
<i>to loot and murder.</i>

06:22.845 --> 06:27.475
<i>In their madness, they</i>
<i>obliterated a civilization.</i>

06:34.824 --> 06:36.724
<i>In the name of piety...</i>

06:36.926 --> 06:38.791
<i>... in a mockery of their religion...</i>

06:38.995 --> 06:41.930
<i>... the Spaniards utterly</i>
<i>destroyed a society...</i>

06:42.131 --> 06:44.622
<i>... with an art, astronomy,</i>
<i>and architecture...</i>

06:44.834 --> 06:47.029
<i>... the equal of anything in Europe.</i>

06:50.306 --> 06:54.242
<i>We revile the Conquistadors for their</i>
<i>cruelty and shortsightedness...</i>

06:54.444 --> 06:56.105
<i>... for choosing death.</i>

06:56.312 --> 07:00.339
<i>We admire La Pérouse and the Tlingit</i>
<i>for their courage and wisdom...</i>

07:00.550 --> 07:03.144
<i>... for choosing life.</i>

07:03.352 --> 07:05.320
<i>The choice is with us still.</i>

07:05.521 --> 07:09.958
<i>But the civilization now in</i>
<i>jeopardy is all humanity.</i>

07:12.128 --> 07:14.153
As the ancient mythmakers knew...

07:14.363 --> 07:17.423
...we're children equally
of the Earth and sky.

07:17.633 --> 07:19.760
In our tenure on this planet...

07:19.969 --> 07:23.405
...we've accumulated dangerous
evolutionary baggage:

07:23.606 --> 07:25.938
Propensities for
aggression and ritual...

07:26.142 --> 07:30.010
...submission to leaders,
hostility to outsiders.

07:30.213 --> 07:33.671
All of which puts our
survival in some doubt.

07:33.883 --> 07:36.374
But we've also acquired
compassion for others...

07:36.586 --> 07:37.712
...love for our children...

07:37.920 --> 07:40.616
...a desire to learn from
history and experience...

07:40.823 --> 07:44.554
...and a great, soaring,
passionate intelligence.

07:44.761 --> 07:49.460
The clear tools for our continued
survival and prosperity.

07:54.437 --> 07:57.065
Which aspects of our nature
will prevail...

07:57.273 --> 07:58.604
...is uncertain.

07:58.808 --> 08:02.574
Particularly when our visions and
prospects are bound...

08:02.779 --> 08:06.647
...to one small part of
the small planet Earth.

08:06.849 --> 08:08.510
But up there in the cosmos...

08:08.718 --> 08:11.881
...an inescapable perspective awaits.

08:12.088 --> 08:16.218
National boundaries are not evident
when we view the Earth from space.

08:16.425 --> 08:19.724
Fanatic ethnic or religious
or national identifications...

08:19.929 --> 08:21.829
...are difficult to support...

08:22.031 --> 08:25.398
...when we see our planet
as a fragile blue crescent...

08:25.601 --> 08:28.764
...fading to become an inconspicuous
point of light...

08:28.971 --> 08:33.340
...against the bastion and citadel
of the stars.

08:34.177 --> 08:37.340
There are not yet obvious signs of
extraterrestrial intelligence...

08:37.547 --> 08:40.675
...and this makes us wonder whether
civilizations like ours...

08:40.883 --> 08:44.717
...rush inevitably, headlong
to self-destruction.

08:44.921 --> 08:46.286
I dream about it.

08:46.489 --> 08:49.947
And sometimes they're bad dreams.

09:02.872 --> 09:04.601
<i>In the vision of a dream...</i>

09:04.807 --> 09:06.638
<i>... I once imagined myself...</i>

09:06.843 --> 09:10.438
<i>... searching for other civilizations</i>
<i>in the cosmos.</i>

09:10.646 --> 09:12.978
<i>Among a hundred billion galaxies...</i>

09:13.182 --> 09:15.173
<i>... and a billion trillion stars...</i>

09:15.384 --> 09:19.878
<i>... life and intelligence should</i>
<i>have arisen on many worlds.</i>

09:21.891 --> 09:25.622
<i>Some worlds are barren</i>
<i>and desolate...</i>

09:25.828 --> 09:27.955
<i>... on them life never began...</i>

09:28.164 --> 09:32.294
<i>... or may have been extinguished</i>
<i>in some cosmic catastrophe.</i>

09:32.501 --> 09:34.435
<i>There may be worlds rich in life...</i>

09:34.637 --> 09:39.472
<i>... but not yet evolved to</i>
<i>intelligence and high technology.</i>

09:39.675 --> 09:42.872
<i>There may be civilizations</i>
<i>that achieve technology...</i>

09:43.079 --> 09:47.209
<i>... and then promptly use it</i>
<i>to destroy themselves.</i>

09:47.416 --> 09:49.976
<i>And perhaps</i>
<i>there are also beings...</i>

09:50.186 --> 09:52.916
<i>... who learned to live with their</i>
<i>technology and themselves.</i>

09:53.122 --> 09:54.885
<i>Beings who endure...</i>

09:55.091 --> 09:59.118
<i>... and become citizens of the cosmos.</i>

10:11.474 --> 10:13.135
<i>Immersed in these thoughts...</i>

10:13.342 --> 10:17.039
<i>... I found myself approaching</i>
<i>a world that was clearly inhabited...</i>

10:17.246 --> 10:19.714
<i>... a world I had visited before.</i>

10:19.916 --> 10:23.374
<i>I saw a planet encompassed by light...</i>

10:23.586 --> 10:27.317
<i>... and recognized the signature</i>
<i>of intelligence.</i>

10:32.361 --> 10:33.828
<i>But suddenly...</i>

10:34.030 --> 10:38.160
<i>... darkness, total and absolute.</i>

10:49.278 --> 10:50.506
<i>In my dream...</i>

10:50.713 --> 10:53.307
<i>... I could read the</i> Book of Worlds.

10:53.516 --> 10:55.245
<i>A vast encyclopedia...</i>

10:55.451 --> 10:58.716
<i>... of a billion planets</i>
<i>within the Milky Way.</i>

11:15.972 --> 11:18.167
<i>What could the computer tell me...</i>

11:18.374 --> 11:22.140
<i>... about this now-darkened world?</i>

11:32.355 --> 11:36.223
<i>They must have survived</i>
<i>some earlier catastrophe.</i>

11:39.428 --> 11:42.158

<i>from ours.</i>

11:52.942 --> 11:54.239

12:26.275 --> 12:29.642

18:38.714 --> 18:43.651
Nuclear weapons have almost become
a home handicraft industry.

18:44.553 --> 18:48.853
The conventional bombs of World War II
were called "blockbusters."

18:49.057 --> 18:53.790
Filled with 20 tons of TNT, they
could destroy a city block.

18:53.996 --> 18:57.488
All the bombs dropped on all the
cities of World War II...

18:57.699 --> 19:00.224
...amounted to some
2 million tons of TNT.

19:00.436 --> 19:02.063
Two megatons.

19:02.271 --> 19:04.535
Coventry and Rotterdam.

19:04.740 --> 19:06.230
Dresden and Tokyo.

19:06.442 --> 19:08.774
All the death that rained
from the skies...

19:08.977 --> 19:11.969
...between 1939 and 1945.

19:12.181 --> 19:17.050
100,000 blockbusters.
Two megatons.

19:17.252 --> 19:21.746
Today, two megatons is the equivalent
of a single thermonuclear bomb.

19:21.957 --> 19:24.949
One bomb with the destructive force...

19:25.160 --> 19:27.788
...of the Second World War.

19:27.996 --> 19:30.521
But there are tens of thousands
of nuclear weapons.

19:30.732 --> 19:33.758
The missile and bomber forces
of the Soviet Union and U. S...

19:33.969 --> 19:38.406
...have warheads aimed at over
15,000 designated targets.

19:38.607 --> 19:41.405
No place on the planet is safe.

19:41.610 --> 19:44.272
The energy contained
in these weapons...

19:44.480 --> 19:46.209
...genies of death...

19:46.415 --> 19:50.818
...patiently awaiting
the rubbing of the lamps...

19:51.019 --> 19:53.647
...totals far more than
10,000 megatons.

19:53.856 --> 19:57.451
But with the destruction
concentrated efficiently...

19:57.659 --> 20:00.890
...not over six years,
but over a few hours.

20:01.096 --> 20:05.032
A blockbuster for every family
on the planet.

20:05.234 --> 20:08.101
A World War II every second...

20:08.303 --> 20:11.864
...for the length of a lazy afternoon.

20:13.442 --> 20:15.307
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

20:17.779 --> 20:19.440
The bomb dropped on Hiroshima...

20:19.648 --> 20:22.173
...killed 70,000 people.

20:22.384 --> 20:24.579
In a full nuclear exchange...

20:24.786 --> 20:27.448
...in the paroxysm of global death...

20:27.656 --> 20:30.489
...the equivalent of
a million Hiroshima bombs...

20:30.692 --> 20:33.456
...would be dropped all
over the world.

20:33.662 --> 20:35.687
In such an exchange
not everyone would be...

20:35.898 --> 20:39.959
...killed by the blast and firestorm
and the immediate radiation.

20:40.168 --> 20:42.796
There would be other agonies:

20:43.005 --> 20:43.994
Loss of loved ones...

20:44.206 --> 20:48.609
...the legions of the burned and
blinded and mutilated...

20:48.810 --> 20:50.505
...the absence of medical care...

20:50.712 --> 20:52.043
...disease, plague...

20:52.247 --> 20:56.308
...long-lived radiation poisoning
of the soil and the water.

20:56.518 --> 21:01.387
The threat of tumors and stillbirths
and malformed children.

21:01.590 --> 21:05.151
And the hopeless sense of
a civilization destroyed for nothing.

21:05.360 --> 21:09.456
The knowledge that we could have
prevented it and did not.

21:12.334 --> 21:15.701
The global balance of terror...

21:15.904 --> 21:18.668
...pioneered by the U.S.
and the Soviet Union...

21:18.874 --> 21:22.310
...holds hostage
all the citizens of the Earth.

21:22.511 --> 21:25.105
Each side persistently probes...

21:25.314 --> 21:27.714
...the limits of
the other's tolerance...

21:27.916 --> 21:31.647
...like the Cuban missile crisis...

21:32.154 --> 21:34.418
...the testing of
anti-satellite weapons...

21:34.623 --> 21:37.114
...the Vietnam and Afghanistan wars.

21:37.326 --> 21:39.294
The hostile military
establishments are...

21:39.494 --> 21:43.294
...locked in some ghastly
mutual embrace.

21:43.498 --> 21:45.227
Each needs the other.

21:45.434 --> 21:49.165
But the balance of terror
is a delicate balance...

21:49.371 --> 21:52.898
...with very little margin
for miscalculation.

21:54.476 --> 21:58.276
And the world impoverishes
itself by spending...

21:58.981 --> 22:03.418
...a trillion dollars a year
on preparations for war.

22:03.619 --> 22:05.211
And by employing perhaps...

22:05.420 --> 22:08.480
...half the scientists and high
technologists on the planet...

22:08.690 --> 22:10.817
...in military endeavors.

22:13.028 --> 22:14.723
How would we explain all this...

22:14.930 --> 22:17.296
...to a dispassionate
extraterrestrial observer?

22:17.499 --> 22:21.333
What account would we give
of our stewardship...

22:21.536 --> 22:23.003
...of the planet Earth?

22:23.205 --> 22:26.663
We have heard the rationales
offered by the superpowers.

22:26.875 --> 22:29.503
We know who speaks
for the nations.

22:29.711 --> 22:32.179
But who speaks
for the human species?

22:32.381 --> 22:34.440
Who speaks for Earth?

22:35.617 --> 22:39.815
From an extraterrestrial perspective,
our global civilization is...

22:40.022 --> 22:42.456
...clearly on the edge of failure...

22:42.658 --> 22:44.558
...in the most important task it faces:

22:44.760 --> 22:48.196
Preserving the lives and well-being
of its citizens...

22:48.397 --> 22:51.560
...and the future habitability
of the planet.

22:51.767 --> 22:56.204
But if we're willing to live with the
growing likelihood of nuclear war...

22:56.405 --> 22:59.568
...shouldn't we also be willing
to explore vigorously...

22:59.775 --> 23:02.403
...every possible means to
prevent nuclear war?

23:02.611 --> 23:05.307
Shouldn't we consider,
in every nation...

23:05.514 --> 23:08.574
...major changes in the traditional
ways of doing things?

23:08.784 --> 23:10.581
A fundamental restructuring...

23:10.786 --> 23:14.415
...of economic, political,
social and religious institutions?

23:14.923 --> 23:17.756
We've reached a point where
there can be no more...

23:17.959 --> 23:19.859
...special interests or cases.

23:20.195 --> 23:23.722
Nuclear arms threaten every
person on Earth.

23:25.100 --> 23:29.503
Fundamental changes in society
are sometimes labeled...

23:29.705 --> 23:33.903
...impractical or contrary
to human nature...

23:34.109 --> 23:36.407
...as if nuclear war were practical...

23:36.611 --> 23:39.603
...or as if there were only
one human nature.

23:40.215 --> 23:42.809
But fundamental changes can
clearly be made.

23:43.018 --> 23:44.986
We're surrounded by them.

23:45.187 --> 23:47.849
In the last two centuries,
abject slavery...

23:48.056 --> 23:50.616
...which was with us for
thousands of years...

23:50.826 --> 23:52.919
...has almost entirely
been eliminated...

23:53.128 --> 23:55.722
...in a stirring
worldwide revolution.

23:55.931 --> 23:59.526
Women, systematically mistreated
for millennia...

23:59.735 --> 24:02.636
...are gradually gaining the political
and economic power...

24:02.838 --> 24:05.102
...traditionally denied to them.

24:05.307 --> 24:09.903
And some wars of aggression have
recently been stopped or curtailed...

24:10.112 --> 24:12.342
...because of a revulsion...

24:12.547 --> 24:15.710
...felt by the people in
the aggressor nations.

24:15.917 --> 24:18.044
The old appeals...

24:18.253 --> 24:21.154
...to racial, sexual,
and religious chauvinism...

24:21.356 --> 24:24.621
...and to rabid nationalist fervor...

24:24.826 --> 24:26.657
...are beginning not to work.

24:26.862 --> 24:30.525
A new consciousness is developing
which sees the Earth as...

24:30.732 --> 24:32.256
...a single organism...

24:32.467 --> 24:36.597
...and recognizes that an organism
at war with itself...

24:36.805 --> 24:38.238
...is doomed.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.170
We are one planet.

24:43.178 --> 24:46.807
<i>One of the great revelations of</i>
<i>the age of space exploration...</i>

24:47.015 --> 24:50.143
<i>... is the image of the Earth,</i>
<i>finite and lonely...</i>

24:50.352 --> 24:55.221
<i>... somehow vulnerable, bearing</i>
<i>the entire human species...</i>

24:55.423 --> 24:59.154
<i>... through the oceans</i>
<i>of space and time.</i>

24:59.361 --> 25:01.727
<i>But this is an ancient perception.</i>

25:01.930 --> 25:03.693
<i>In the 3rd century B. C...</i>

25:03.899 --> 25:06.390
<i>... our planet was mapped and</i>
<i>accurately measured...</i>

25:06.601 --> 25:10.731
<i>... by a Greek scientist named</i>
<i>Eratosthenes, who worked in Egypt.</i>

25:10.939 --> 25:13.533
<i>This was the world as he knew it.</i>

25:14.309 --> 25:16.641
<i>Eratosthenes was the director...</i>

25:16.845 --> 25:19.541
<i>... of the great Library</i>
<i>of Alexandria...</i>

25:19.748 --> 25:24.014
<i>... the center of science and learning</i>
<i>in the ancient world.</i>

25:25.253 --> 25:29.314
<i>Aristotle had argued that humanity</i>
<i>was divided into Greeks...</i>

25:29.524 --> 25:33.426
<i>... and everybody else,</i>
<i>who he called "barbarians"...</i>

25:33.628 --> 25:37.655
<i>... and that the Greeks should keep</i>
<i>themselves racially pure.</i>

25:37.866 --> 25:42.235
<i>He taught that it was fitting for</i>
<i>the Greeks to enslave other peoples.</i>

25:42.437 --> 25:47.204
<i>But Eratosthenes criticized Aristotle</i>
<i>for his blind chauvinism.</i>

25:47.409 --> 25:51.573
<i>He believed there was good and bad</i>
<i>in every nation.</i>

25:51.780 --> 25:56.080
<i>The Greek conquerors had invented</i>
<i>a new god for the Egyptians...</i>

25:56.284 --> 25:59.481
<i>... but he looked remarkably Greek.</i>

25:59.688 --> 26:02.213
<i>Alexander was portrayed as pharaoh...</i>

26:02.424 --> 26:04.688
<i>... in a gesture to the Egyptians.</i>

26:04.893 --> 26:09.387
<i>But in practice, the Greeks were</i>
<i>confident of their superiority.</i>

26:10.398 --> 26:14.391
<i>The protests of the librarian hardly</i>
<i>constituted a serious challenge...</i>

26:14.603 --> 26:16.400
<i>... to prevailing prejudices.</i>

26:16.605 --> 26:19.472
<i>Their world was as imperfect</i>
<i>as our own.</i>

26:19.674 --> 26:23.269
<i>But the Ptolemies, the Greek kings of</i>
<i>Egypt who followed Alexander...</i>

26:23.478 --> 26:25.343
<i>... had at least this virtue:</i>

26:25.547 --> 26:28.710
<i>They supported the advancement</i>
<i>of knowledge.</i>

26:28.917 --> 26:32.250
<i>Popular ideas about the nature of</i>
<i>the cosmos were challenged...</i>

26:32.454 --> 26:34.354
<i>... and some of them, discarded.</i>

26:34.556 --> 26:36.114
<i>New ideas were proposed...</i>

26:36.324 --> 26:38.792
<i>... and found to be in</i>
<i>better accord with the facts.</i>

26:38.994 --> 26:41.861
<i>There were imaginative proposals,</i>
<i>vigorous debates...</i>

26:42.063 --> 26:43.428
<i>... brilliant syntheses.</i>

26:43.632 --> 26:45.600
<i>The resulting treasure</i>
<i>of knowledge...</i>

26:45.800 --> 26:48.701
<i>... was recorded and preserved</i>
<i>for centuries...</i>

26:48.904 --> 26:51.372
<i>... on these shelves.</i>

26:52.741 --> 26:56.609
<i>Science came of age</i>
<i>in this library.</i>

26:59.214 --> 27:03.344
The Ptolemies didn't merely
collect old knowledge.

27:03.551 --> 27:07.248
They supported scientific research
and generated new knowledge.

27:07.455 --> 27:09.252
The results were amazing.

27:09.457 --> 27:13.860
Eratosthenes accurately calculated
the size of the Earth.

27:14.062 --> 27:15.154
He mapped it...

27:15.363 --> 27:18.560
...and he argued that it could be
circumnavigated.

27:18.767 --> 27:22.794
Hipparchus anticipated that
stars come into being...

27:23.004 --> 27:25.564
...slowly move during the course
of centuries...

27:25.774 --> 27:27.105
...and eventually perish.

27:27.309 --> 27:29.300
It was he who first catalogued...

27:29.511 --> 27:32.241
...the positions and magnitudes
of the stars...

27:32.547 --> 27:35.710
...in order to determine whether
there were such changes.

27:35.917 --> 27:38.715
Euclid produced a textbook
on geometry...

27:38.920 --> 27:42.083
...which human beings learned from
for 23 centuries.

27:42.290 --> 27:47.023
It's still a great read, full
of the most elegant proofs.

27:47.228 --> 27:50.823
Galen wrote basic works on
healing and anatomy...

27:51.032 --> 27:53.762
...which dominated medicine
until the Renaissance.

27:53.969 --> 27:55.630
These are just a few examples.

27:55.837 --> 27:58.169
There were dozens of
great scholars here...

27:58.373 --> 28:02.139
...and hundreds of fundamental
discoveries.

28:06.481 --> 28:09.882
<i>Some of those discoveries have</i>
<i>a distinctly modern ring.</i>

28:10.085 --> 28:14.021
<i>Apollonius of Perga studied</i>
<i>the parabola and the ellipse...</i>

28:14.222 --> 28:17.988
<i>... curves that we know today describe</i>
<i>the paths of falling objects...</i>

28:18.193 --> 28:19.558
<i>... in a gravitational field...</i>

28:19.761 --> 28:22.992
<i>... and space vehicles traveling</i>
<i>between the planets.</i>

28:23.198 --> 28:27.635
<i>Heron of Alexandria invented</i>
<i>steam engines and gear trains...</i>

28:27.836 --> 28:31.670
<i>... he was the author of</i>
<i>the first book on robots.</i>

28:31.873 --> 28:35.206
<i>Imagine how different our world</i>
<i>would be if those discoveries...</i>

28:35.410 --> 28:38.140
<i>... had been used</i>
<i>for the benefit of everyone.</i>

28:38.346 --> 28:41.213
<i>If the humane perspective</i>
<i>of Eratosthenes...</i>

28:41.416 --> 28:43.680
<i>... had been widely</i>
<i>adopted and applied.</i>

28:43.885 --> 28:46.786
<i>But this was not to be.</i>

28:48.656 --> 28:51.853
Alexandria was the greatest city...

28:52.060 --> 28:55.154
...the Western world had ever seen.

28:55.363 --> 28:57.331
People from all nations came here...

28:57.532 --> 28:59.727
...to live, to trade, to learn.

28:59.934 --> 29:01.458
On a given day...

29:01.669 --> 29:04.661
...these harbors were thronged...

29:04.873 --> 29:08.331
...with merchants and scholars,
tourists.

29:08.543 --> 29:09.737
It's probably here...

29:09.944 --> 29:13.471
...that the word "cosmopolitan"
realized its true meaning...

29:13.681 --> 29:16.946
...of a citizen,
not just of a nation...

29:17.152 --> 29:19.086
...but of the cosmos.

29:19.287 --> 29:24.224
To be a citizen of the cosmos.

29:24.926 --> 29:29.056
Here were clearly the seeds
of our modern world.

29:29.264 --> 29:32.233
But why didn't they
take root and flourish?

29:32.434 --> 29:36.803
Why, instead, did the West slumber
through 1000 years of darkness...

29:37.005 --> 29:40.771
...until Columbus and Copernicus
and their contemporaries...

29:40.975 --> 29:44.376
...rediscovered the work done here?

29:44.579 --> 29:46.809
I cannot give you a simple answer...

29:47.015 --> 29:48.880
...but I do know this:

29:49.084 --> 29:52.918
There is no record in the entire
history of the library...

29:53.121 --> 29:57.057
...that any of the illustrious scholars
and scientists who worked here...

29:57.258 --> 29:59.590
...ever seriously challenged...

29:59.794 --> 30:04.026
...a single political or economic
or religious assumption...

30:04.232 --> 30:06.530
...of the society in which they lived.

30:06.734 --> 30:10.693
The permanence of the stars
was questioned.

30:10.905 --> 30:14.773
The justice of slavery was not.

30:30.225 --> 30:33.456
Science and learning in general...

30:33.661 --> 30:36.289
...were the preserve
of the privileged few.

30:36.498 --> 30:40.628
The vast population of this city
had not the vaguest notion...

30:40.835 --> 30:44.601
...of the great discoveries being
made within these walls.

30:44.806 --> 30:46.205
How could they?

30:46.407 --> 30:50.138
The new findings were not
explained or popularized.

30:50.345 --> 30:53.746
The progress made here
benefitted them little.

30:53.948 --> 30:56.473
Science was not part of their lives.

30:56.684 --> 30:59.676
The discoveries in mechanics, say...

30:59.888 --> 31:01.719
...or steam technology...

31:01.923 --> 31:05.825
...mainly were applied to
the perfection of weapons...

31:06.027 --> 31:08.325
...to the encouragement
of superstition...

31:08.530 --> 31:10.498
...to the amusement of kings.

31:10.698 --> 31:14.566
Scientists never seemed to grasp
the enormous potential...

31:14.769 --> 31:17.704
...of machines to free people...

31:17.906 --> 31:21.535
...from arduous and repetitive labor.

31:21.743 --> 31:23.904
The intellectual achievements
of antiquity...

31:24.112 --> 31:26.774
...had few practical applications.

31:26.981 --> 31:31.918
Science never captured
the imagination of the multitude.

31:32.420 --> 31:35.947
There was no counterbalance
to stagnation, to pessimism...

31:36.157 --> 31:40.560
...to the most abject surrender
to mysticism.

31:40.762 --> 31:43.925
So when, at long last...

31:44.132 --> 31:46.965
...the mob came
to burn the place down...

31:47.168 --> 31:49.568
...there was nobody to stop them.

32:11.459 --> 32:14.485
Let me tell you about the end.

32:14.696 --> 32:18.962
It's a story about the last
scientist to work in this place.

32:19.167 --> 32:22.398
A mathematician, astronomer,
physicist...

32:22.604 --> 32:27.439
...and head of the school of Neo-
Platonic philosophy in Alexandria.

32:27.642 --> 32:29.872
That's an extraordinary range
of accomplishments...

32:30.078 --> 32:32.672
...for any individual, in any age.

32:32.880 --> 32:35.644
Her name was Hypatia.

32:35.850 --> 32:40.446
She was born in this city
in the year 370 A.D.

32:42.957 --> 32:46.688
This was a time when women
had essentially no options.

32:46.894 --> 32:49.226
They were considered property.

32:49.430 --> 32:53.127
Nevertheless, Hypatia was able
to move freely...

32:53.334 --> 32:54.995
...unselfconsciously...

32:55.203 --> 32:58.661
...through traditional male domains.

32:58.873 --> 33:02.172
By all accounts,
she was a great beauty.

33:02.377 --> 33:04.004
And although she had many suitors...

33:04.212 --> 33:07.113
...she had no interest in marriage.

33:08.383 --> 33:13.320
The Alexandria of Hypatia's time,
by then long under Roman rule...

33:13.688 --> 33:16.623
...was a city in grave conflict.

33:16.824 --> 33:20.351
Slavery, the cancer
of the ancient world...

33:20.561 --> 33:24.895
...had sapped classical civilization
of its vitality.

33:25.099 --> 33:27.533
The growing Christian Church was...

33:27.735 --> 33:29.635
...consolidating its power...

33:29.837 --> 33:34.365
...and attempting to eradicate
pagan influence and culture.

33:34.575 --> 33:38.944
Hypatia stood at the focus...

33:39.147 --> 33:43.982
...at the epicenter
of mighty social forces.

33:44.185 --> 33:47.916
Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria,
despised her...

33:48.122 --> 33:52.252
...in part because of her close
friendship with a Roman governor...

33:52.460 --> 33:56.590
...but also because she was a symbol
of learning and science...

33:56.798 --> 34:01.235
...which were largely identified
by the early Church with paganism.

34:02.236 --> 34:03.965
In great personal danger...

34:04.172 --> 34:07.903
...Hypatia continued to teach
and to publish...

34:08.109 --> 34:12.739
...until, in the year 415 A.D.,
on her way to work...

34:12.947 --> 34:15.074
...she was set upon...

34:15.283 --> 34:18.650
...by a fanatical mob of
Cyril's followers.

34:18.853 --> 34:21.515
They dragged her from her chariot...

34:21.723 --> 34:23.350
...tore off her clothes...

34:23.558 --> 34:27.392
...and flayed her flesh
from her bones...

34:27.595 --> 34:29.961
...with abalone shells.

34:30.164 --> 34:33.691
Her remains were burned,
her works obliterated...

34:33.901 --> 34:35.425
...her name forgotten.

34:35.636 --> 34:38.799
Cyril was made a saint.

34:41.309 --> 34:45.268
The glory you see around me...

34:45.480 --> 34:48.313
...is nothing but a memory.

34:48.516 --> 34:50.006
It does not exist.

34:51.753 --> 34:54.722
The last remains of the
library were destroyed...

34:54.922 --> 34:57.447
...within a year of Hypatia's death.

34:57.658 --> 35:01.321
It's as if an entire
civilization had undergone...

35:01.529 --> 35:05.659
...a sort of self-inflicted
radical brain surgery...

35:06.033 --> 35:08.297
...so that most of its memories...

35:08.503 --> 35:11.666
...discoveries, ideas and passions...

35:11.873 --> 35:15.274
...were irrevocably wiped out.

35:17.812 --> 35:20.940
The loss was incalculable.

35:21.182 --> 35:23.480
In some cases, we know only...

35:23.684 --> 35:27.313
...the tantalizing titles of books
that had been destroyed.

35:27.555 --> 35:32.288
In most cases, we know neither
the titles nor the authors.

35:32.493 --> 35:34.927
We do know that in this library...

35:35.129 --> 35:39.156
...there were 123 different
plays by Sophocles...

35:39.367 --> 35:42.427
...of which only seven have
survived to our time.

35:42.637 --> 35:45.435
One of those seven is <i>Oedipus Rex.</i>

35:45.640 --> 35:48.507
Similar numbers apply
to the lost works of...

35:48.709 --> 35:52.201
...Aeschylus, Euripides, Aristophanes.

35:52.413 --> 35:56.076
It's a little as if the only
surviving works of a man named...

35:56.284 --> 35:58.218
...William Shakespeare...

35:58.419 --> 36:02.378
...were <i>Coriolanus</i>
and <i>A Winter's Tale...</i>

36:02.590 --> 36:05.582
...although we knew he had
written some other things...

36:05.793 --> 36:07.886
...which were
highly prized in his time.

36:08.095 --> 36:11.553
Plays called <i>Hamlet, Macbeth...</i>

36:11.766 --> 36:15.327
<i>... A Midsummer's Night Dream,</i>
<i>Julius Caesar, King Lear...</i>

36:15.536 --> 36:17.367
<i>... Romeo and Juliet.</i>

36:24.512 --> 36:27.572
History is full of people...

36:27.782 --> 36:31.741
...who, out of fear or ignorance...

36:31.953 --> 36:33.386
...or the lust for power...

36:33.588 --> 36:37.547
...have destroyed treasures
of immeasurable value...

36:37.758 --> 36:41.353
...which truly belong to all of us.

36:41.562 --> 36:45.396
We must not let it happen again.

37:06.254 --> 37:08.745
<i>We have considered</i>
<i>the destruction of worlds...</i>

37:08.956 --> 37:11.481
<i>... and the end of civilizations.</i>

37:11.692 --> 37:15.389
<i>But there is another perspective</i>
<i>by which to measure human endeavors.</i>

37:15.596 --> 37:19.293
<i>Let me tell you a story</i>
<i>about the beginning.</i>

37:19.800 --> 37:21.995
<i>Some 15 billion years ago...</i>

37:22.203 --> 37:23.727
<i>... our universe began...</i>

37:23.938 --> 37:27.305
<i>... with the mightiest explosion</i>
<i>of all time.</i>

37:27.508 --> 37:31.069
<i>The universe expanded,</i>
<i>cooled and darkened.</i>

37:31.279 --> 37:34.578
<i>Energy condensed into matter,</i>
<i>mostly hydrogen atoms.</i>

37:34.782 --> 37:38.240
<i>And these atoms accumulated</i>
<i>into vast clouds...</i>

37:38.452 --> 37:40.079
<i>... rushing away from each other...</i>

37:40.288 --> 37:43.519
<i>... that would one day become</i>
<i>the galaxies.</i>

37:44.559 --> 37:48.757
<i>Within these galaxies the first</i>
<i>generation of stars was born...</i>

37:48.963 --> 37:51.363
<i>... kindling the energy</i>
<i>hidden in matter...</i>

37:51.566 --> 37:54.296
<i>... flooding the cosmos with light.</i>

37:54.502 --> 37:59.439
<i>Hydrogen atoms had made</i>
<i>suns and starlight.</i>

38:01.342 --> 38:04.937
<i>There were in those times</i>
<i>no planets to receive the light...</i>

38:05.146 --> 38:09.276
<i>... and no living creatures to admire</i>
<i>the radiance of the heavens.</i>

38:09.483 --> 38:11.383
<i>But deep in the stellar furnaces...</i>

38:11.586 --> 38:14.612
<i>... nuclear fusion was creating</i>
<i>the heavier atoms:</i>

38:14.822 --> 38:17.791
<i>Carbon and oxygen,</i>
<i>silicon and iron.</i>

38:17.992 --> 38:21.223
<i>These elements, the ash left</i>
<i>by hydrogen...</i>

38:21.429 --> 38:26.366
<i>... were the raw materials from which</i>
<i>planets and life would later arise.</i>

38:26.567 --> 38:30.503
<i>At first, the heavy elements were</i>
<i>trapped in the hearts of the stars.</i>

38:30.705 --> 38:33.799
<i>But massive stars soon</i>
<i>exhausted their fuel...</i>

38:34.008 --> 38:35.498
<i>... and in their death throes...</i>

38:35.710 --> 38:38.736
<i>... returned most of their substance</i>
<i>back into space.</i>

38:38.946 --> 38:43.315
<i>The interstellar gas became</i>
<i>enriched in heavy elements.</i>

38:44.986 --> 38:46.419
<i>In the Milky Way galaxy...</i>

38:46.621 --> 38:50.580
<i>... the matter of the cosmos was recycled</i>
<i>into new generations of stars...</i>

38:50.791 --> 38:52.759
<i>... now rich in heavy atoms.</i>

38:52.960 --> 38:56.657
<i>A legacy from</i>
<i>their stellar ancestors.</i>

38:58.366 --> 39:00.561
<i>And in the cold</i>
<i>of interstellar space...</i>

39:00.768 --> 39:04.260
<i>... great turbulent clouds were</i>
<i>gathered by gravity...</i>

39:04.472 --> 39:07.305
<i>... and stirred by starlight.</i>

39:11.212 --> 39:12.304
<i>In their depths...</i>

39:12.513 --> 39:16.142
<i>... the heavy atoms condensed into</i>
<i>grains of rocky dust and ice...</i>

39:16.350 --> 39:19.410
<i>... and complex</i>
<i>carbon-based molecules.</i>

39:19.620 --> 39:22.680
<i>In accordance with the laws</i>
<i>of physics and chemistry...</i>

39:22.890 --> 39:27.759
<i>... hydrogen atoms had brought forth</i>
<i>the stuff of life.</i>

39:35.169 --> 39:38.536
<i>In other clouds, more massive</i>
<i>aggregates of gas and dust...</i>

39:38.739 --> 39:41.207
<i>... formed later generations of stars.</i>

39:41.409 --> 39:43.138
<i>As new stars were formed...</i>

39:43.344 --> 39:46.279
<i>... tiny condensations of matter</i>
<i>accreted near them...</i>

39:46.480 --> 39:50.177
<i>... inconspicuous motes of</i>
<i>rock and metal, ice and gas...</i>

39:50.384 --> 39:52.249
<i>... that would become the planets.</i>

39:52.453 --> 39:55.422
<i>And on these worlds,</i>
<i>as in interstellar clouds...</i>

39:55.623 --> 39:57.454
<i>... organic molecules formed...</i>

39:57.658 --> 40:01.321
<i>... made of atoms that had been</i>
<i>cooked inside the stars.</i>

40:01.529 --> 40:04.589
<i>In the tide pools and oceans</i>
<i>of many worlds...</i>

40:04.799 --> 40:09.065
<i>... molecules were destroyed by</i>
<i>sunlight and assembled by chemistry.</i>

40:09.270 --> 40:12.433
<i>One day, among these</i>
<i>natural experiments...</i>

40:12.640 --> 40:15.438
<i>... a molecule arose, that,</i>
<i>quite by accident...</i>

40:15.643 --> 40:18.703
<i>... was able to make crude copies</i>
<i>of itself.</i>

40:24.318 --> 40:27.776
<i>As time passed, self-replication</i>
<i>became more accurate.</i>

40:27.988 --> 40:29.785
<i>Those molecules that copied better...</i>

40:29.990 --> 40:31.548
<i>... produced more copies.</i>

40:31.759 --> 40:34.250
<i>Natural selection was underway.</i>

40:34.462 --> 40:37.488
<i>Elaborate molecular machines</i>
<i>had evolved.</i>

40:37.698 --> 40:41.964
<i>Slowly, imperceptibly, life had begun.</i>

40:48.876 --> 40:53.142
<i>Collectives of organic molecules</i>
<i>evolved into one-celled organisms.</i>

40:53.347 --> 40:55.872
<i>These produced multi-celled colonies.</i>

40:56.083 --> 40:59.450
<i>Their various parts became</i>
<i>specialized organs.</i>

40:59.653 --> 41:03.054
<i>Some colonies attached themselves</i>
<i>to the sea floor...</i>

41:03.257 --> 41:06.055
<i>... others swam freely.</i>

41:07.228 --> 41:10.288
<i>Eyes evolved, and now the cosmos</i>
<i>could see.</i>

41:10.498 --> 41:13.661
<i>Living things moved on</i>
<i>to colonize the land.</i>

41:13.868 --> 41:16.496
<i>The reptiles held sway for a time...</i>

41:16.704 --> 41:20.731
<i>... but gave way to small warm-blooded</i>
<i>creatures with bigger brains...</i>

41:20.941 --> 41:25.071
<i>... who developed dexterity and</i>
<i>curiosity about their environment.</i>

41:25.279 --> 41:28.646
<i>They learned to use tools and</i>
<i>fire and language.</i>

41:28.849 --> 41:31.545
<i>Star stuff,</i>
<i>the ash of stellar alchemy...</i>

41:31.752 --> 41:34.687
<i>... had emerged into consciousness.</i>

41:45.266 --> 41:49.566
<i>We are a way for the cosmos</i>
<i>to know itself.</i>

41:49.770 --> 41:51.761
<i>We are creatures of the cosmos...</i>

41:51.972 --> 41:55.271
<i>... and have always hungered</i>
<i>to know our origins...</i>

41:55.476 --> 41:59.105
<i>... to understand our connection</i>
<i>with the universe.</i>

41:59.313 --> 42:01.838
<i>How did everything come to be?</i>

42:03.450 --> 42:06.351
<i>Every culture on the planet</i>
<i>has devised its own response...</i>

42:06.554 --> 42:09.523
<i>... to the riddle</i>
<i>posed by the universe.</i>

42:13.594 --> 42:18.224
<i>Every culture celebrates</i>
<i>the cycles of life and nature.</i>

42:19.834 --> 42:22.268
<i>There are many different ways</i>
<i>of being human.</i>

42:26.507 --> 42:28.532
<i>But an extraterrestrial visitor...</i>

42:28.742 --> 42:31.506
<i>... examining the differences</i>
<i>among human societies...</i>

42:31.712 --> 42:34.146
<i>... would find those</i>
<i>differences trivial...</i>

42:34.348 --> 42:36.680
<i>... compared to the similarities.</i>

42:44.325 --> 42:47.226
<i>We are one species.</i>

43:06.947 --> 43:10.542
<i>We are star stuff,</i>
<i>harvesting starlight.</i>

43:10.951 --> 43:13.886
<i>Our lives, our past and our future...</i>

43:14.088 --> 43:18.582
<i>... are tied to the sun, the moon</i>
<i>and the stars.</i>

43:22.062 --> 43:25.122
<i>Our ancestors knew that</i>
<i>their survival depended...</i>

43:25.332 --> 43:27.027
<i>... on understanding the heavens.</i>

43:27.234 --> 43:29.828
<i>They built observatories</i>
<i>and computers...</i>

43:30.037 --> 43:34.565
<i>... to predict the changing of the</i>
<i>seasons by the motions in the skies.</i>

43:34.775 --> 43:36.936
<i>We are, all of us...</i>

43:37.144 --> 43:40.341
<i>... descended from astronomers.</i>

43:42.516 --> 43:44.711
<i>The discovery of order</i>
<i>in the universe...</i>

43:44.919 --> 43:46.409
<i>... of the laws of nature...</i>

43:46.620 --> 43:50.784
<i>... is the foundation on which</i>
<i>science builds today.</i>

43:57.898 --> 43:59.490
<i>Our conception of the cosmos...</i>

43:59.700 --> 44:01.725
<i>... all of modern science</i>
<i>and technology...</i>

44:01.936 --> 44:05.929
<i>... trace back to questions</i>
<i>raised by the stars.</i>

44:07.574 --> 44:09.735
<i>Yet, even 400 years ago...</i>

44:09.944 --> 44:12.777
<i>... we still had no idea</i>
<i>of our place in the universe.</i>

44:12.980 --> 44:15.346
<i>The long journey to</i>
<i>that understanding...</i>

44:15.549 --> 44:18.382
<i>... required both an unflinching</i>
<i>respect for the facts...</i>

44:18.585 --> 44:21.349
<i>... and a delight</i>
<i>in the natural world.</i>

44:24.124 --> 44:26.058
<i>Johannes Kepler wrote:</i>

44:34.668 --> 44:35.692
<i>Similarly...</i>

44:35.903 --> 44:38.872

46:30.384 --> 46:32.852
<i>Science is a collective enterprise...</i>

<i>In every age, and sometimes</i>

<i>What dream of the mind's eye</i>

46:59.413 --> 47:03.611
<i>These dreams begin</i>

47:06.553 --> 47:11.047
<i>Once, even to see a planet through</i>

47:11.258 --> 47:12.816
<i>But we studied these worlds...</i>

47:13.026 --> 47:15.688
<i>... we figured out how</i>
<i>they moved in their orbits...</i>

47:15.896 --> 47:18.763
<i>... and soon we were planning</i>
<i>voyages of discovery...</i>

47:18.966 --> 47:20.399
<i>... beyond the Earth...</i>

47:20.601 --> 47:25.095
<i>... and sending robot explorers</i>
<i>to the planets and the stars.</i>

47:39.920 --> 47:44.050
<i>We humans long to be connected</i>
<i>with our origins...</i>

47:45.025 --> 47:47.493
<i>... so we create rituals.</i>

47:48.662 --> 47:51.256
<i>Science is another way</i>
<i>to express this longing.</i>

47:51.465 --> 47:53.729
<i>It also connects us</i>
<i>with our origins.</i>

47:53.934 --> 47:58.303
<i>And it, too, has its rituals</i>
<i>and its commandments.</i>

48:07.214 --> 48:11.844
<i>Its only sacred truth is that</i>
<i>there are no sacred truths.</i>

48:14.855 --> 48:16.755
Temperature systems...

48:17.124 --> 48:19.649
SAGAN: <i>All assumptions must</i>
<i>be critically examined.</i>

48:19.860 --> 48:23.125
<i>Arguments from authority</i>
<i>are worthless.</i>

48:26.867 --> 48:29.233
FEMALE SCIENTIST:
Transducer power is on.

48:34.841 --> 48:36.900
SAGAN: <i>Whatever is inconsistent</i>
<i>with the facts...</i>

48:37.110 --> 48:39.203
<i>... no matter how</i>
<i>fond of it we are...</i>

48:39.413 --> 48:42.576
<i>... must be discarded or revised.</i>

48:51.091 --> 48:53.321
<i>Science is not perfect.</i>

48:53.527 --> 48:55.085
<i>It's often misused.</i>

48:55.295 --> 48:57.160
<i>It's only a tool.</i>

48:57.431 --> 48:59.126
<i>But it's the best tool we have...</i>

48:59.333 --> 49:02.063
<i>... self-correcting, ever-changing...</i>

49:02.269 --> 49:04.760
<i>... applicable to everything.</i>

49:10.677 --> 49:15.137
<i>With this tool,</i>
<i>we vanquish the impossible.</i>

49:40.741 --> 49:42.402
<i>With the methods of science...</i>

49:42.609 --> 49:46.045
<i>... we have begun</i>
<i>to explore the cosmos.</i>

49:48.682 --> 49:51.310
<i>For the first time,</i>
<i>scientific discoveries...</i>

49:51.518 --> 49:53.850
<i>... are widely accessible.</i>

49:57.224 --> 49:58.691
<i>Our machines...</i>

49:58.892 --> 50:00.382
<i>... the products of science...</i>

50:00.594 --> 50:03.062
<i>... are now beyond</i>
<i>the orbit of Saturn.</i>

50:09.670 --> 50:12.230
<i>A preliminary spacecraft</i>
<i>reconnaissance...</i>

50:12.439 --> 50:15.431
<i>... has been made of 20 new worlds.</i>

50:16.109 --> 50:19.169
<i>We have learned to value</i>
<i>careful observations...</i>

50:19.379 --> 50:22.280
<i>... to respect the facts, even</i>
<i>when they are disquieting...</i>

50:22.482 --> 50:25.474
<i>... when they seem to contradict</i>
<i>conventional wisdom.</i>

50:26.486 --> 50:30.855
<i>The Canterbury monks faithfully</i>
<i>recorded an impact on the moon...</i>

50:31.058 --> 50:35.222
<i>... and the Anasazi people,</i>
<i>an explosion of a distant star.</i>

50:35.429 --> 50:38.694
<i>They saw for us as we see for them.</i>

50:38.899 --> 50:42.357
<i>We see further than they only because</i>
<i>we stand on their shoulders.</i>

50:42.569 --> 50:44.161
<i>We build on what they knew.</i>

50:44.371 --> 50:46.566
<i>We depend on free inquiry...</i>

50:46.773 --> 50:49.298
<i>... and free access to knowledge.</i>

50:49.543 --> 50:53.035
<i>We humans have seen the atoms</i>
<i>which constitute all of matter...</i>

50:53.246 --> 50:57.046
<i>... and the forces that sculpt</i>
<i>this world and others.</i>

51:02.189 --> 51:04.020
<i>We know</i>
<i>the molecules of life...</i>

51:04.224 --> 51:07.057
<i>... are easily formed</i>
<i>under conditions common...</i>

51:07.260 --> 51:09.956
<i>... throughout the cosmos.</i>

51:10.163 --> 51:13.655
<i>We have mapped the molecular machines</i>
<i>at the heart of life.</i>

51:15.469 --> 51:18.961
<i>We have discovered a microcosm</i>
<i>in a drop of water.</i>

51:19.206 --> 51:21.003
<i>We have peered</i>
<i>into the bloodstream...</i>

51:21.208 --> 51:23.267
<i>... and down on our stormy planet...</i>

51:23.477 --> 51:26.571
<i>... to see the Earth</i>
<i>as a single organism.</i>

51:26.780 --> 51:28.907
<i>We have found volcanoes</i>
<i>on other worlds...</i>

51:29.116 --> 51:31.084
<i>... and explosions on the sun...</i>

51:31.284 --> 51:33.718
<i>... studied comets from</i>
<i>the depths of space...</i>

51:33.920 --> 51:37.481
<i>... and traced their origins</i>
<i>and destinies...</i>

51:37.691 --> 51:39.454
<i>... listened to pulsars...</i>

51:39.659 --> 51:42.594
<i>... and searched for</i>
<i>other civilizations.</i>

51:44.464 --> 51:47.865
<i>We humans have set foot</i>
<i>on another world...</i>

51:48.068 --> 51:50.662
<i>... in a place called</i>
<i>the Sea of Tranquility...</i>

51:50.871 --> 51:54.170
<i>... an astonishing achievement</i>
<i>for creatures such as we...</i>

51:54.374 --> 51:57.969
<i>... whose earliest footsteps,</i>
<i>3 ½ million years old...</i>

51:58.178 --> 52:02.672
<i>... are preserved in the volcanic</i>
<i>ash of East Africa.</i>

52:02.883 --> 52:05.374
<i>We have walked far.</i>

53:35.876 --> 53:38.970
<i>These are some of the things</i>
<i>that hydrogen atoms do...</i>

53:39.179 --> 53:43.775
<i>... given 15 billion years</i>
<i>of cosmic evolution.</i>

53:45.819 --> 53:48.947
It has the sound of epic myth.

53:49.155 --> 53:50.588
But it's simply a description...

53:50.790 --> 53:52.451
...of the evolution of the cosmos...

53:52.659 --> 53:56.117
...as revealed by science in our time.

53:56.329 --> 53:57.591
And we...

53:57.797 --> 54:01.255
...we who embody the local
eyes and ears...

54:01.468 --> 54:03.766
...and thoughts and feelings
of the cosmos...

54:03.970 --> 54:08.100
...we've begun, at last, to wonder
about our origins.

54:08.308 --> 54:11.675
Star stuff, contemplating the stars...

54:11.878 --> 54:16.474
...organized collections of 10 billion-
billion-billion atoms...

54:16.683 --> 54:18.742
...contemplating the evolution
of matter...

54:18.952 --> 54:23.480
...tracing that long path by which
it arrived at consciousness...

54:23.690 --> 54:25.351
...here on the planet Earth...

54:25.559 --> 54:28.357
...and perhaps, throughout the cosmos.

54:29.029 --> 54:33.966
Our loyalties are to the species
and the planet.

54:34.167 --> 54:36.260
We speak for Earth.

54:36.469 --> 54:38.960
Our obligation to survive
and flourish...

54:39.172 --> 54:41.834
...is owed not just to ourselves...

54:42.042 --> 54:46.308
...but also to that cosmos,
ancient and vast...

54:46.513 --> 54:48.310
...from which we spring.

55:28.955 --> 55:32.482
The greatest thrill for me
in reliving this adventure...

55:32.692 --> 55:36.753
...has been not just
that we've completed...

55:36.963 --> 55:39.693
...the preliminary reconnaissance
with spacecraft...

55:39.899 --> 55:42.424
...of the entire solar system.

55:42.636 --> 55:44.661
And not just that we've discovered...

55:44.871 --> 55:48.773
...astonishing structures in
the realm of the galaxies...

55:48.975 --> 55:50.442
...but especially...

55:50.644 --> 55:55.377
...that some of <i>Cosmos'</i> boldest
dreams about this world...

55:55.582 --> 55:57.743
...are coming closer to reality.

55:57.951 --> 56:00.977
Since this series' maiden voyage...

56:01.187 --> 56:03.155
...the impossible has come to pass.

56:03.356 --> 56:08.293
Mighty walls that maintained
insuperable ideological differences...

56:08.595 --> 56:10.893
...have come tumbling down.

56:11.097 --> 56:15.591
Deadly enemies have embraced
and begun to work together.

56:15.802 --> 56:18.270
The imperative to cherish
the Earth...

56:18.471 --> 56:22.430
...and to protect the global
environment that sustains all of us...

56:22.642 --> 56:25.110
...has become widely accepted.

56:25.311 --> 56:27.438
And we've begun, finally...

56:27.647 --> 56:28.944
...the process of reducing...

56:29.149 --> 56:33.017
...the obscene number of weapons
of mass destruction.

56:33.219 --> 56:36.017
Perhaps we have, after all...

56:36.222 --> 56:39.316
...decided to choose life.

56:40.894 --> 56:44.091
But we still have light-years
to go to ensure that choice...

56:44.297 --> 56:49.234
...even after the summits and
the ceremonies and the treaties.

56:49.436 --> 56:54.373
There are still some 50,000
nuclear weapons in the world.

56:54.708 --> 56:58.576
And it would require the detonation
of only a tiny fraction of them...

56:58.778 --> 57:01.246
...to produce a nuclear winter...

57:01.448 --> 57:04.417
...the predicted global
climatic catastrophe...

57:04.617 --> 57:08.553
...that would result from the smoke
and dust lifted into the atmosphere...

57:08.755 --> 57:13.021
...by burning cities
and petroleum facilities.

57:13.226 --> 57:17.162
The world's scientific community has
begun to sound the alarm...

57:17.363 --> 57:19.627
...about the grave dangers
posed by...

57:19.833 --> 57:22.267
...depleting the protective
ozone shield...

57:22.469 --> 57:24.596
...and by greenhouse warming.

57:24.804 --> 57:28.262
And again, we're taking some
mitigating steps.

57:28.475 --> 57:32.002
But again,
those steps are too small...

57:32.212 --> 57:34.703
...and too slow.

57:35.014 --> 57:38.643
The discovery that such a thing as
nuclear winter was really possible...

57:38.852 --> 57:42.151
...evolved out of studies
of Martian dust storms.

57:42.355 --> 57:46.121
The surface of Mars,
fried by ultraviolet light...

57:46.326 --> 57:48.590
...is also a reminder
of why it's important...

57:48.795 --> 57:51.593
...to keep our ozone layer intact.

57:51.798 --> 57:54.460
The runaway greenhouse effect
on Venus...

57:54.667 --> 57:56.191
...is a valuable reminder...

57:56.402 --> 58:00.896
...that we must take the increasing
greenhouse effect on Earth seriously.

58:01.107 --> 58:04.941
Important lessons about
our environment...

58:05.145 --> 58:08.478
...have come from spacecraft missions
to the planets.

58:08.681 --> 58:10.546
By exploring other worlds...

58:10.750 --> 58:12.718
...we safeguard this one.

58:12.919 --> 58:15.149
By itself, this fact
more than justifies...

58:15.355 --> 58:17.289
...the money our species has spent...

58:17.490 --> 58:21.256
...in sending ships to other worlds.

58:21.861 --> 58:24.352
It is our fate...

58:24.564 --> 58:27.362
...to live during one of
the most perilous...

58:27.567 --> 58:29.330
...and one of the most hopeful...

58:29.536 --> 58:31.504
...chapters in human history.

58:31.704 --> 58:34.400
Our science and our technology...

58:34.607 --> 58:36.131
...have posed us...

58:36.342 --> 58:38.572
...a profound question:

58:38.778 --> 58:42.270
Will we learn to use these tools...

58:42.482 --> 58:46.851
...with wisdom and foresight
before it's too late?

58:47.053 --> 58:50.989
Will we see our species safely
through this difficult passage...

58:51.191 --> 58:55.321
...so that our children and
grandchildren will continue...

58:55.528 --> 58:59.123
...the great journey of discovery
still deeper...

58:59.332 --> 59:03.826
...into the mysteries of the cosmos?

59:04.037 --> 59:08.804
That same rocket and nuclear
and computer technology...

59:09.008 --> 59:13.911
...that sends our ships past
the farthest known planet...

59:14.113 --> 59:18.243
...can also be used to destroy
our global civilization.

59:18.451 --> 59:21.011
Exactly the same technology...

59:21.221 --> 59:23.121
...can be used for good...

59:23.323 --> 59:24.881
...and for evil.

59:25.091 --> 59:27.685
It is as if...

59:27.894 --> 59:29.521
...there were a god...

59:29.729 --> 59:31.594
...who said to us:

59:31.798 --> 59:35.199
"I set before you two ways.

59:35.401 --> 59:38.962
You can use your technology
to destroy yourselves...

59:39.172 --> 59:44.109
...or to carry you to the planets
and the stars.

59:44.377 --> 59:45.969
It's up to you."
