00:02.170 --> 00:04.605
ANNOUNCER:
An FX original series.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.174
Mr. InBetween.

00:07.275 --> 00:10.744
All new,
Thursdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.081
(motors revving)

00:13.114 --> 00:16.750
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Mayans.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.987
- Previously
on "Mayans M.C."...

00:20.020 --> 00:22.256
- Anything I can do to help
you or your family.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.924
- The money transfers.

00:23.957 --> 00:27.361
They were used to hire
a gunman to kill my parents.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.764
- EZ knows a hit man
killed Marisol.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.266
He was supposed to kill you
too.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.168
- EZ told you this?
- Yes.

00:34.202 --> 00:37.671
He also knows that
the payments came from Mexico.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.940
Dita signed the checks.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.209
- I need to know the truth

00:41.242 --> 00:43.111
about what happened
in the desert.

00:43.144 --> 00:47.248
Rebels, Adelita, Galindo,
Palomo, all the pieces.

00:47.281 --> 00:51.051
If not, I'll have ICE pick up
Felipe Reyes.

00:51.085 --> 00:53.221
- Your Spanish is colloquial.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.623
You didn't learn it in school.

00:55.656 --> 00:58.392
- That I learned from an angel
in Coatzacoalcos.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.294
- Where's that angel now?

01:11.272 --> 01:13.541
- The Irish have nowhere
to bring their guns.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.143
I'm sorry to be dropping
all this shit

01:15.176 --> 01:17.645
in your lap right now but--
- You wanna bring them south.

01:17.678 --> 01:20.781
- Aye.
We have contacts in Tijuana.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.150
- The Vatos Malditos.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.318
- They're coming up here.

01:24.352 --> 01:26.120
- You didn't tell me you guys
got into it with the Mayans.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.791
- Hey, nothing's gonna go off
the rails with us here.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.126
You got my word.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.501
- Barely got a pulse.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.670
- Call a fucking ambulance!
- Now!

01:42.703 --> 01:44.004
- You all right, man?

01:44.037 --> 01:46.106
- I can't fucking see.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.980
- Dr. Yee, please report
to Radiology.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.815
Dr. Yee.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.284
- I can't believe they
discharged you already.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.489
- Two Band-Aids
and an eye patch.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.123
Not even a fucking lollipop.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.758
- What'd the doc say?

02:04.792 --> 02:06.494
- Got about 60%
in the left eye,

02:06.527 --> 02:08.429
less than 20 on the right.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.331
Think it should eventually
come back.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.466
Gotta see a specialist,
find out what's up.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.540
- You in pain?
- Not much.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.108
I'm just pissed, carnal.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.644
Want every fucking Vato dead.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.713
How's Riz?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.970
- What's the latest?

02:50.003 --> 02:51.805
- Doc feels good about
the surgery.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.675
He stopped the bleeding,
pulled the fragments.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.311
- Lungs are still fucked,
but, uh,

02:57.345 --> 02:59.880
pretty boy is gonna
pull through this.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.849
- Fuck yeah, he is.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.654
Didn't even mess up his hair.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.022
- Riz is a warrior.
- Yeah.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.567
- Ramos is on his way down.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.435
Kings will be in Santo Padre
by morning.

04:14.422 --> 04:17.291
Not much sleeping going on.

04:17.325 --> 04:19.793
- No.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.763
- How long she been out there?

04:22.796 --> 04:24.432
- About a half a bottle
of merlot.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.435
Do you need anything?

04:36.276 --> 04:37.445
Sit.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.819
I fucked us up, hermano.

04:48.822 --> 04:52.159
In this shadow game
with Potter--

04:52.192 --> 04:53.661
Adelita was right.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.529
I lost sight
of what I already had.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.932
- You did what you had to do,
Mikey.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.968
- I did what I wanted to do.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.536
- Hm.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.838
- We never had secrets before.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.807
Right, not like this.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.913
Every lie I tell her,
I can feel it, man.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.983
I get one in return.

05:19.186 --> 05:22.322
- Maybe the same thing happens
with the truth.

05:22.356 --> 05:25.192
Honesty buys honesty.

05:28.896 --> 05:31.031
She loves you, Mikey.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.433
You can't fake that shit.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.705
That's not a lie.

05:50.618 --> 05:53.186
- I'm sitting down with
the Kings in the morning.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.822
- Why?

05:54.855 --> 05:56.490
This is a charter play.

05:56.524 --> 06:00.027
- Yeah, but the deal with
Charming impacts the whole MC.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.762
- Bish, they fucking
ambushed us.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.096
Tried to wipe us out
after a sit-down.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.666
- On tribal land.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.201
- I know.
- Let's just get home.

06:08.235 --> 06:12.039
Get some rest.
Put this on the table tomorrow.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.941
- I'll stay with Riz.
- I'm with you.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.577
- Good.
Hey, keep us posted.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.480
- Let's get the fuck
out of here.

06:31.158 --> 06:34.261
- * Mother of exiles

06:34.294 --> 06:36.263
* The torch of hope

06:36.296 --> 06:39.199
* In the toss of the tempest

06:39.232 --> 06:41.902
* Threw us Madison's rope

06:41.935 --> 06:44.237
* But the brazen giant

06:44.271 --> 06:47.140
* With limbs astride

06:47.174 --> 06:50.277
* Blocks the golden door

06:50.310 --> 06:54.081
* To the U.S. of Lies

06:54.114 --> 06:58.118
* Damn your huddled masses

06:58.151 --> 07:01.054
* Scrub our floors

07:01.088 --> 07:03.290
* Cut our grasses

07:03.323 --> 07:06.293
* I am a wolf

07:06.326 --> 07:08.962
* A wild cur

07:08.996 --> 07:11.098
* Cut from the pack

07:12.432 --> 07:15.002
* With blood on my fur

07:15.035 --> 07:17.738
* Every howl

07:17.771 --> 07:20.474
* Marks the debt

07:20.508 --> 07:23.977
* 'Cause a beaten dog

07:25.445 --> 07:28.982
* Never forgets

07:29.016 --> 07:31.652
* Every howl

07:31.685 --> 07:34.454
* Marks the debt

07:34.488 --> 07:39.259
* 'Cause a beaten dog

07:39.292 --> 07:42.029
* Never forgets

07:44.865 --> 07:47.801
* Never forgets

08:22.169 --> 08:23.336
- We talked to Charming.

08:23.370 --> 08:24.972
SOA is pissed.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.674
Chibs reached out to Palo.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.209
I guess the VM see it as
getting their pound of flesh

08:29.242 --> 08:31.579
for what happened
with the migrants.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.181
- What happened with the Vatos

08:34.214 --> 08:37.484
in our backyard,
that was outlaw shit.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.553
They took the risk,
they paid the price.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.555
What happened last night,
that was fucked.

08:43.624 --> 08:44.925
They broke every rule.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.594
- I know.

08:46.627 --> 08:49.529
If it was my charter,
I'd be upside-down too.

08:49.563 --> 08:52.099
But we gotta look
at the big picture.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.533
- VM are the only ones

08:53.567 --> 08:55.435
that can make
this gun transfer work.

08:55.468 --> 08:58.438
Money from those Irish weapons
will help fund the charters

08:58.471 --> 08:59.707
that aren't cashing in
on the heroin,

08:59.740 --> 09:01.308
and we owe it to--
- I get it.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.578
- Carnal,

09:04.612 --> 09:06.614
we know what the Vatos did
was bullshit,

09:06.647 --> 09:08.916
but if Riz pulls through,

09:08.949 --> 09:10.884
we didn't lose anyone.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.453
And the VM sees it
as a settled score.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.256
We move on--
- Tell that to my fucking crew.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.927
- Your charter makes the call.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.795
They decide on retaliation,

09:21.829 --> 09:22.963
but if there is...

09:25.232 --> 09:27.000
It becomes a club-wide problem.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.238
And you need to make that clear
at your table

09:31.271 --> 09:34.675
as their president
and as a Mayan shot-caller.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.229
- Brother.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.330
- Be safe.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.233
- Prez don't look happy.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.841
- They heading out?

10:07.875 --> 10:10.678
- Gonna stay at Vicky's
till we sort this out.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.946
- What's there to sort out?

10:14.514 --> 10:15.615
- You're a smart man, Coco.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.952
You know what's at stake here.
- Yeah.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.354
My fucking eyesight.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.356
This shit don't get better,
I may never ride again.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.525
- We're looking at millions
of dollars in gun revenue

10:25.558 --> 10:27.427
for the entire
Mayan organization.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.962
- We're a fucking
corporation now?

10:28.996 --> 10:31.832
That's what happened in there.

10:31.865 --> 10:35.202
CEOs deciding what's best
for Mayans Incorporated.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.680
I hope that involves
a fucking health plan,

10:46.714 --> 10:48.248
'cause I'm gonna need it.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.753
- Shit.

10:55.522 --> 10:56.890
Oh, my God.

11:03.530 --> 11:04.998
- I'll stay close.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.805
- Mi primo,

11:11.839 --> 11:13.874
see if he has time for me.

11:20.213 --> 11:23.183
Man, this is fucked.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.152
- With a capital F.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.720
I'll reach out to Taza
and Creeper

11:26.754 --> 11:28.655
and get their proxies.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.758
We'll vote on retaliation
this afternoon.

11:47.040 --> 11:47.975
- Hey.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.011
He okay?

11:51.044 --> 11:52.980
He's not.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.550
- Pop's on the way.
Needs to talk to us.

11:57.584 --> 12:00.120
- About what?
- History.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.755
That's all he said.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.390
- My worst fucking subject.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.328
- There you go, Pop.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.601
- Thanks.

12:17.004 --> 12:20.740
The documents in the lockbox.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.010
Ignacio Cortina.

12:28.148 --> 12:31.985
I grew up in a small town
with the Galindos.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.420
It was a dirt poor village

12:33.453 --> 12:35.655
about 40 miles north
of Hermosillo.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.228
When I was a kid,
my grandmother took in

12:41.261 --> 12:44.965
a bastard Galindo's
old man fathered.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.334
Saved the family from shame.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.769
Ostracized by the church.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.940
Jose never forgot.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.943
- Shit.

12:55.976 --> 12:59.146
- 20 years later
I was a federale in Sonora.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.315
Anti-drug squad.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.855
One of my first big
undercover stings went bad.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.222
Two innocents were killed.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.192
My career was over.

13:15.829 --> 13:19.366
Jose Galindo made it
all go away.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.134
Saved my job.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.469
- You were in his debt.

13:26.706 --> 13:29.242
- And that's where
the shit got complicated.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.016
Now it's your turn.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.251
I know you've been digging
into Mom's death.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.822
- Emily told you.

13:42.856 --> 13:45.725
- She came to me with
some information she found,

13:45.758 --> 13:48.828
terrified of what it meant.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.865
- Money transfers.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.671
We know who pulled the trigger.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.875
A Nomad, a member
of the North Cali Sons crew.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.212
Still don't know who hired him.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.679
- What did Emily find?

14:10.017 --> 14:12.085
- Bring everything you have--
everything you know--

14:12.119 --> 14:13.853
over to my house tonight.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.488
- Why can't you tell us
right now?

14:15.522 --> 14:19.026
- I made a promise that
all parties would be there.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.194
We all have a different piece
of the puzzle.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.529
- How you gonna get Emily

14:22.562 --> 14:24.031
to the house without
Galindo knowing?

14:24.064 --> 14:26.066
- I'll figure it out.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.867
I'll let you know what time.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.949
- Grabbing something to eat.
You hungry?

14:41.982 --> 14:44.017
- You should come with us, EZ.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.618
Gabi works there.
She's been asking about you.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.719
- Ooh.
- Oh, yeah?

14:46.753 --> 14:48.121
- Mm-hmm.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.256
- She doing okay?

14:49.289 --> 14:50.723
- Ask her yourself.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.792
- Don't act like you got game,
Junior.

14:52.825 --> 14:55.362
Come on.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.130
- Kings Road,
near the library?

14:57.164 --> 14:58.231
- See you there.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.041
- Could you print them out
for me?

15:08.075 --> 15:10.110
- I will.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.079
- I just, uh, need my notes.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.916
Sorry.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

15:21.989 --> 15:25.192
- Oh, you're not interrupting.

15:29.129 --> 15:32.332
I got this from
Montserrat Palomo.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.003
Information about Potter.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.179
- It's a woman?

15:46.213 --> 15:48.248
- A woman he loved.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.282
And their child.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.785
- Are you going
to threaten them?

15:52.819 --> 15:54.287
- No.

15:54.321 --> 15:57.090
No, it turns out this woman
was a key witness

15:57.124 --> 15:58.758
in a capital murder case.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.460
One of Potter's first big wins

16:00.493 --> 16:02.029
while working with
the Mexican government.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.432
- Sleeping with your witness?

16:05.465 --> 16:06.966
- Mm.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.936
- They'd throw out the case
and overturn the verdict.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.939
- That's why
he kept it a secret,

16:12.972 --> 16:14.341
even after his son was born.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.945
- That would fuck
with his Mexican tenure.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.847
- Oh, he'd be done
in this part of the world.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.018
- Why are you telling me this?

16:26.819 --> 16:27.854
- Because.

16:29.422 --> 16:33.493
I'd use this leverage
to help Adelita.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.728
And I don't want any more
secrets about her

16:35.762 --> 16:37.430
or anything else.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.011
Look, you were right, Em.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.848
I lost sight
of what's important.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.552
You.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.054
Cristobal.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.956
My life on this side.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.232
I don't want any more lies.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.835
- Neither do I.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.705
- I just want to know
that we can trust each other.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.542
- That's all I want.

17:22.575 --> 17:26.079
- I promise I'll tell you
whatever you wanna know.

17:27.947 --> 17:30.049
- Okay.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.284
- And I need the same from you.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.056
- Mm-hmm.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.592
- I know last night wasn't
about picking up steaks.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.561
I just want the truth.

17:41.594 --> 17:44.131
What's going on with EZ
and his father?

17:44.164 --> 17:45.198
First my mother,
then you--

17:45.232 --> 17:46.866
- I told you.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.468
I promised to make us
dinner last night.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.103
- Emily, please.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.741
- What do you want me to say?

17:58.778 --> 18:00.280
- Ileana's clerk,

18:00.313 --> 18:02.449
the one who conveniently
killed himself

18:02.482 --> 18:04.484
to forfeit the better bid.
What happened?

18:04.517 --> 18:07.587
- You think I had
something to do with it?

18:07.620 --> 18:10.089
Miguel, it was a suicide.
They closed the case.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.091
- Yeah, because Peña pushed
to close it.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.893
She didn't want her detectives
digging too deep

18:13.926 --> 18:14.961
for fear of finding
something messy

18:14.994 --> 18:16.296
that might lead back to me.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.264
- Well, I don't know
anything about that.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.331
- Oh, okay.

18:18.365 --> 18:19.299
Well, then, what do you know?

18:19.332 --> 18:21.134
- I know that this whole,

18:21.168 --> 18:22.635
"Let's not have
any more secrets, baby,"

18:22.669 --> 18:24.304
is bullshit.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.272
You don't trust me?

18:25.305 --> 18:26.606
Fine.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.507
Put a fucking tracker
on my ankle.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.477
- Emily.
Emily.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.328
- No, thank you.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.032
Marcus.

19:35.442 --> 19:38.345
- Sorry.
It's our busiest time.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.547
- When Letty said you worked
in a restaurant, I thought--

19:40.580 --> 19:42.081
- You did not think
I would be parked

19:42.114 --> 19:44.016
on the side of the street.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.198
- It's a rough time
to being undocumented.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.669
ICE raids,
border crackdowns.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.737
Paranoia spinning from the top.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.373
- I know.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.775
They are with my family
in Lodi.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.043
It is less intense up north.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.847
- Look, I know...

20:16.783 --> 20:19.419
You've got a lot going on
with work and school.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.521
- I do.

20:30.129 --> 20:31.764
- I guess I am.

20:31.798 --> 20:32.932
- You guess?

20:42.241 --> 20:43.976
- I would like that.

21:29.322 --> 21:30.623
- Hi.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.164
What is it?

21:41.300 --> 21:44.270
- I know you don't like me
very much.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.873
- I love you, Dita.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.675
We all do.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.018
- I wanted to die that night.

22:02.088 --> 22:04.824
The fire.
That was my plan.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.160
- I know that.

22:11.364 --> 22:13.400
- You know why?

22:18.070 --> 22:19.338
- Devante?

22:20.907 --> 22:22.675
- Yes, partly.

22:24.711 --> 22:27.013
Devante was my connection
to the past.

22:29.015 --> 22:33.420
To the life that I loved
outside the circle.

22:35.722 --> 22:40.560
But mostly, Emily,

22:40.593 --> 22:42.862
it was because
I lost my purpose.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.700
As a woman,
as a mother.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.102
I felt like I was no longer
needed or wanted.

22:50.136 --> 22:51.404
- That's not true.

22:51.438 --> 22:52.572
- Of course it is.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.576
Miguel can't let go
of the betrayal.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.412
- The lie about his brother.

22:59.446 --> 23:01.347
You have to support him
in that,

23:01.380 --> 23:05.184
and this little one,
I'm afraid he barely knows me

23:05.217 --> 23:07.687
from the four nannies
that take care of him.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.922
- I'm sorry, Dita.
I--

23:12.158 --> 23:13.259
I never wanted that.
I--

23:13.292 --> 23:15.728
- I know.

23:15.762 --> 23:18.565
And seeing what's happening
between you and Miguel...

23:20.833 --> 23:24.236
I can't help but feel that I'm
at least partially responsible.

23:26.739 --> 23:27.774
I've been a burden.
- No.

23:27.807 --> 23:31.077
- Yes.

23:31.110 --> 23:34.614
I've watch the divide between
you two grow wider and wider,

23:34.647 --> 23:38.384
and if you don't fix it now,
you will lose each other.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.087
A marriage can't hold
that kind of distance.

23:45.458 --> 23:46.759
Excuse me.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.231
Hello?

23:52.264 --> 23:53.966
- Hello, Dita.
It's Felipe.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.267
- Yes, I know.

23:56.803 --> 23:59.205
- I have a favor I need.
A big one.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.275
- You talk to Chibs?

24:03.309 --> 24:05.244
- Yeah.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.615
He thinks what the Vatos did
was fucked.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.149
He gets it if we have
to strike back,

24:10.182 --> 24:11.918
but he also knows
the Irish will move on

24:11.951 --> 24:13.520
if we can't make it work
in Mexico.

24:15.622 --> 24:18.324
- Look, primo, you gotta do
what's right for the charter

24:18.357 --> 24:19.826
and the MC.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.494
It's a hard call.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.631
Now, if you're asking
what I would do,

24:24.664 --> 24:27.133
I got a personal stake
with the guns.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.335
It's a promise I made
to Jax Teller.

24:29.368 --> 24:31.738
Hard for me to look at this
without that connection.

24:33.540 --> 24:34.674
- I know.

24:38.477 --> 24:42.782
A fucking rock
and a fucking hard place.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.150
- Where's your crew
landing on this?

24:44.183 --> 24:46.853
- It's split.

24:46.886 --> 24:51.157
- Coco, rightfully so,
is hell-bent on blowing it up.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.159
I'm sure Angel and Gilly
are with him.

24:53.192 --> 24:55.895
- Just got off the phone
with Taza.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.164
He lands wherever you do.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.132
Same with me.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.568
Creeper was on the fence,

25:01.601 --> 25:04.537
but thinks the gun money
trumps blood.

25:07.039 --> 25:10.242
- So it looks like you got
the call, Prez.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.911
Your vote sways the majority.

25:31.964 --> 25:34.433
Obispo, this is why
I split the power

25:34.466 --> 25:36.736
of the Mayans
between three kings.

25:36.769 --> 25:39.338
Handed the lead chair to you.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.941
It's not the same club
I started, primo.

25:41.974 --> 25:45.111
It's bigger,
sophisticated,

25:45.144 --> 25:46.646
much more profitable.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.117
The way Mayans is growing,
in a few years,

25:51.150 --> 25:52.952
you'll rival any syndicate
in the country.

25:56.288 --> 26:00.192
- I guess we're not just
motorcycle enthusiasts anymore.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.560
- We never were.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.297
You up for the challenge?

26:09.101 --> 26:11.671
- Yeah.
I am.

26:13.572 --> 26:14.573
- Good.

26:20.512 --> 26:21.648
- You miss it?

26:23.282 --> 26:24.250
- Every fucking day.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.756
I'm sorry I couldn't make it
to Medina's funeral.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.223
- I know.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.426
His widow,
she appreciated the gift.

26:36.963 --> 26:40.432
Getting used to wearing
those $1,000 suits.

26:40.466 --> 26:42.001
- Yeah, it feels nice
to wear one

26:42.034 --> 26:43.302
and not be in court.

26:45.805 --> 26:46.939
I gotta go.

26:49.175 --> 26:50.442
- Yeah.

27:15.902 --> 27:18.370
- Hey.
Talk to Hank?

27:18.404 --> 27:20.306
- Yeah.
I proxied our votes.

27:22.374 --> 27:24.711
Any change?
- No.

27:24.744 --> 27:28.147
Nurses came in and hooked up
a few new IVs.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.716
That's about it.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.387
Can I ask you something?

27:37.256 --> 27:39.325
How come you never mentioned
you were part of the VM?

27:42.094 --> 27:43.963
- Bishop knew.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.631
I guess it just never came up.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.867
- Hmm.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.036
- Look, I was younger,
trying to figure shit out.

27:50.069 --> 27:53.539
Who I was and what I wanted.

27:53.572 --> 27:56.508
- Bad blood with you
and the shot-caller?

27:56.542 --> 27:57.844
- Palo?

27:57.877 --> 28:00.012
- Mm.

28:00.046 --> 28:02.181
- Something like that.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.020
I'm gonna grab a coffee.

28:08.054 --> 28:09.655
You want anything?

28:09.688 --> 28:10.957
- I'm good, man.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.949
- I'm sorry what happened
to you, Coco.

28:36.983 --> 28:39.118
- Yeah, me too, Padrino.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.453
This my daughter, Leticia.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.689
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.358
So you're the one who started
all this, huh?

28:46.392 --> 28:47.927
- Something like that.

28:50.129 --> 28:52.064
- Padrino.
- Angel.

28:52.098 --> 28:54.133
- Missed you, bro.
- Likewise, kid.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.435
- Padrino.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.637
- Can I have a word with you?
- Sure.

29:01.340 --> 29:04.243
I know you and your family
are close to Mrs. Galdino.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.244
Emily.

29:06.645 --> 29:08.147
- Yeah, I guess.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.348
Known each other a long time.

29:10.917 --> 29:11.951
- Miguel and his family
are having

29:11.984 --> 29:13.119
a difficult time
right now.

29:13.152 --> 29:15.054
The fires,

29:15.087 --> 29:16.522
everything going on
with the feds.

29:17.689 --> 29:18.757
- I can imagine.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.628
Something wrong, El Padrino?

29:24.030 --> 29:26.132
- You tell me.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.767
First, Miguel's mother
gets lost in downtown,

29:28.801 --> 29:30.502
ends up at your father's shop.

29:30.536 --> 29:32.638
He drives her home.

29:32.671 --> 29:34.573
- Well, I didn't know that.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.308
I've never met Miguel's mother.

29:36.342 --> 29:37.844
Wouldn't know her if I bumped
into her on the street.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.449
- Right.

29:43.482 --> 29:45.818
But then Emily shows up
at your father's shop

29:45.852 --> 29:49.521
and it was closed.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.590
- You'd have to ask Emily.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.792
- Yeah, problem with that, EZ,
is that for one reason

29:53.826 --> 29:56.528
or the other,
Emily isn't saying much

29:56.562 --> 29:58.197
about anything to anyone.

29:59.966 --> 30:03.802
Agra Park win,
her friend at city planning,

30:03.836 --> 30:05.404
the day clerk.

30:07.639 --> 30:08.975
So many loose ends.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.376
It's got Miguel worried.

30:13.212 --> 30:15.547
- Yeah.
We have history.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.049
I care about her.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.217
If she came to me for help,
I'd help her.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.152
- So did she?

30:21.687 --> 30:23.189
- I'm afraid only she
can answer that.

30:29.761 --> 30:31.864
- I like you, son.

30:31.898 --> 30:33.665
You have a future here.

30:33.699 --> 30:36.969
You're smart,
ambitious.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.670
You seem to have your
priorities in the right order.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.409
But you know what happens
if I find out you lied to me.

30:46.578 --> 30:47.880
- I do, El Padrino.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.022
- All right.

30:57.924 --> 30:59.058
We'll leave it at that.

31:14.907 --> 31:17.743
- This table,

31:17.776 --> 31:19.711
the brothers seated
around it...

31:21.447 --> 31:23.615
It's all that matters to me.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.784
You know that.

31:25.817 --> 31:27.586
I'd take a fucking bullet
for any of you.

31:31.924 --> 31:35.027
With Alvarez gone,
the heroin expansion,

31:35.061 --> 31:37.229
the dance with Potter,

31:37.263 --> 31:40.132
the center of the Mayan
universe has shifted

31:40.166 --> 31:43.135
from Oakland to Santa Padre.

31:43.169 --> 31:46.905
The Irish guns will lock that
down as unshakable truth.

31:46.939 --> 31:49.075
With that comes responsibility,

31:49.108 --> 31:53.079
not just for me
but for all of us.

31:53.112 --> 31:55.047
The entire MC.

31:55.081 --> 31:58.217
Every charter will look
to us for direction.

31:58.250 --> 32:02.154
We set the tone.
We decide the path.

32:02.188 --> 32:03.956
You know what's at stake.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.424
Vote your heart.

32:06.592 --> 32:07.759
But don't ignore your head.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.634
The Vatos Malditos.

32:17.303 --> 32:21.073
Let's decide.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.109
Do we seek vengeance?

32:27.813 --> 32:29.148
- No retaliation.

32:32.651 --> 32:35.187
- Vengeance.
- Vengeance.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.159
- Fucking vengeance.

32:46.665 --> 32:50.636
- If Riz had died,
or Coco,

32:50.669 --> 32:52.004
if what happened
to you was permanent,

32:52.038 --> 32:53.772
I wouldn't hesitate
to strike back,

32:53.805 --> 32:55.641
but looking
at the bigger picture...

32:57.176 --> 32:58.710
For the entire MC...

33:00.546 --> 33:04.483
And for every man sitting
at this table,

33:04.516 --> 33:07.153
I think it's in our best
interest to avoid retaliation.

33:07.186 --> 33:10.456
Taza and Creeper
proxied their votes.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.691
They land the same way.
Majority rules.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.827
No vengeance.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.229
- What about Riz?

33:17.263 --> 33:18.630
He get a fucking vote?

33:18.664 --> 33:21.733
- Even if Riz did vote
to hit back,

33:21.767 --> 33:22.868
I'd break that tie.

33:22.901 --> 33:24.236
- Who the fuck are we, man?

33:24.270 --> 33:25.737
You telling me that
you're gonna sit

33:25.771 --> 33:28.574
at the table with the Vatos?

33:28.607 --> 33:30.008
Pretend this never happened?

33:31.577 --> 33:33.245
'Cause of money?

33:33.279 --> 33:35.081
This ain't who we are.

33:37.383 --> 33:39.385
And you're wrong!

33:39.418 --> 33:41.687
And you're all fucking wrong!

33:45.757 --> 33:46.892
- Leave him.

33:50.062 --> 33:52.231
He can't hear anything
right now.

33:59.305 --> 34:00.372
- No offense, Bish...

34:02.541 --> 34:04.576
But he really can't
see anything, either.

34:06.612 --> 34:09.781
We're not living with the fear
of that shit like he is.

34:23.329 --> 34:25.297
- I made appointments for us.

34:25.331 --> 34:28.234
Jabonosa Day Spa.

34:28.267 --> 34:30.736
- What?
I don't have time.

34:30.769 --> 34:32.704
- Yes, you do.

34:32.738 --> 34:35.907
- Dita, I--
- Please don't argue with me.

34:41.012 --> 34:43.615
Oh, we should all have
dinner afterwards.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.217
Tio Ama Tia.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.253
It's just down the street
from the spa.

34:49.355 --> 34:51.056
- Perfect.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.424
- I'll let him know.

34:52.458 --> 34:53.925
- We should get going.

34:59.831 --> 35:02.201
- Okay.
I got it.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.311
Table voted.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.712
No retaliation.

35:15.847 --> 35:18.617
- I hope that's the right call.

35:18.650 --> 35:21.620
Coco and Riz are gonna
fucking hate us.

35:21.653 --> 35:24.022
- Maybe.

35:24.055 --> 35:26.192
- I need to get some air,
brother.

35:26.225 --> 35:29.161
I can taste the fucking
cancer in this place.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.696
- I hear you.

35:30.729 --> 35:31.697
Take your time.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.227
- We'll be a few hours.

36:13.739 --> 36:16.375
- Hey.

36:16.408 --> 36:18.043
How'd the vote go?

36:19.511 --> 36:20.746
- We're standing down.

36:22.348 --> 36:23.749
- That's probably
the right thing to do.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.184
- Tell that to Coco.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.824
What did Alvarez want?

36:32.858 --> 36:35.093
- Miguel knows something's
going on with Emily.

36:35.126 --> 36:36.695
- This shit?

36:38.764 --> 36:41.099
- Yeah, I guess.

36:41.132 --> 36:43.502
I played dumb.

36:43.535 --> 36:44.903
- Alvarez believe you?

36:44.936 --> 36:46.972
- No.

36:53.312 --> 36:54.413
- Where's Pop?

36:54.446 --> 36:56.448
He said 7:00.

36:56.482 --> 36:58.016
- I don't know.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.150
He was gone when I got here.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.264
- Fuck this guy.

37:13.665 --> 37:14.900
- Right this way.

37:19.971 --> 37:23.309
- Give us a moment.
- Of course.

37:23.342 --> 37:25.911
- Where are we going?
- We're not going anywhere.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.494
- You have an hour and a half.
Don't be late.

37:42.528 --> 37:44.830
I've run out of lies.

37:48.334 --> 37:49.935
- Sorry.

37:49.968 --> 37:52.270
I didn't know how else
to free you up.

37:53.472 --> 37:55.006
It's time to talk.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.183
She doesn't have much time.

38:05.216 --> 38:06.818
- Em.
- Hey.

38:09.855 --> 38:11.390
- You want anything?

38:12.358 --> 38:14.292
- Um, one of those.

38:14.326 --> 38:15.527
- Me too.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.867
- No, that works.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.669
Please, make sure it's set up
before the groundbreaking.

38:26.237 --> 38:28.574
No, that's fine.
Thank you, Dominique.

39:50.722 --> 39:51.723
- Okay, so the money orders,
right?

39:51.757 --> 39:53.625
The ones from Mexico,

39:53.659 --> 39:57.062
they matched entries I found
in a household ledger.

39:57.095 --> 39:59.765
Same dates,
same amounts to the penny.

39:59.798 --> 40:01.099
- Dita Galindo.

40:01.132 --> 40:02.868
- It's Miguel's mom.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.770
Jose must have used
her accounts

40:04.803 --> 40:06.572
to avoid DOJ scrutiny.

40:17.583 --> 40:19.618
- Why would Galindo want you
and Mom dead?

40:23.989 --> 40:25.290
What happened?

40:36.001 --> 40:38.604
- I had an affair
with Dita Galindo.

40:43.509 --> 40:46.277
It was after she lost her son.

40:46.311 --> 40:49.781
Jose had checked out.

40:49.815 --> 40:52.851
Dita was undone,

40:52.884 --> 40:55.754
and I was there.

40:55.787 --> 40:59.290
With her all the time.

40:59.324 --> 41:02.628
Her protection,
her confidant.

41:02.661 --> 41:06.665
It was a mistake...

41:06.698 --> 41:09.034
but I let it happen.

41:10.869 --> 41:12.337
- Holy shit.

41:12.370 --> 41:16.608
- I ended it before
I met your mother,

41:16.642 --> 41:19.878
but Dita couldn't let it go.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.816
And when Isabel
got pregnant with you,

41:24.850 --> 41:27.619
I didn't trust Dita.

41:27.653 --> 41:30.021
I couldn't risk Jose
finding out,

41:30.055 --> 41:33.659
so we had to leave.

41:33.692 --> 41:38.897
We became Felipe
and Marisol Reyes.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.402
- Wait a minute.

41:44.435 --> 41:47.706
Mom was killed
over 20 years later.

41:47.739 --> 41:49.808
Why would Jose wait that long?

41:49.841 --> 41:51.509
- Because he didn't know
you were here.

41:53.211 --> 41:55.747
Until Miguel moved here.

41:55.781 --> 41:57.015
Ten years ago.

41:57.048 --> 41:59.217
- Miguel had nothing
to do with it.

41:59.250 --> 42:02.387
How--how could he even know?

42:02.420 --> 42:05.023
- To take over the business.

42:05.056 --> 42:07.525
I mean, the old man would have
told him all his dirty secrets.

42:07.559 --> 42:10.195
- No, Miguel wouldn't be
involved in a murder.

42:12.397 --> 42:13.699
- Okay, not then.

42:13.732 --> 42:15.366
Not on this side
of the border.

42:15.400 --> 42:16.702
- Then how did anyone know
they were here?

42:18.436 --> 42:20.438
- I'm sorry.

42:22.073 --> 42:24.209
I don't know.

42:27.813 --> 42:29.948
- So what does this mean?

42:34.285 --> 42:35.386
Well, what happens now?

42:37.088 --> 42:38.389
EZ.

42:41.492 --> 42:43.561
What are you gonna do?

42:56.474 --> 42:57.776
Oh, my God.

43:15.961 --> 43:18.129
- That look, EZ...

43:19.765 --> 43:22.901
The way you get,
the way you think...

43:22.934 --> 43:24.502
- I'm not sure what I think.

43:27.205 --> 43:30.341
- You've been chasing
this revenge for ten years.

43:32.010 --> 43:34.012
It can't land on my husband.

43:34.045 --> 43:36.014
- I know where your
loyalties lie, Emily.

43:37.983 --> 43:39.885
You made that very clear
that day at the Indian casino.

43:48.126 --> 43:50.428
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

43:50.461 --> 43:51.863
You do what you have to.

43:51.897 --> 43:54.833
- Oh, what's that, EZ?

43:54.866 --> 43:57.502
Tell Miguel I had you
kill someone for me?

43:59.037 --> 44:02.573
Then helped you find out
that he killed your mom?

44:16.354 --> 44:17.355
- What is it?

44:18.924 --> 44:20.792
- It's Potter.

44:20.826 --> 44:23.061
- Why is Potter texting you?

44:26.564 --> 44:29.835
- He knows about
Ignacio Cortina.

44:29.868 --> 44:31.837
He's threatening
to deport my dad.

44:33.371 --> 44:37.042
He wants Angel and I
to give him intel on Adelita.

44:39.845 --> 44:42.180
He's unraveled about the shit
that went down in the desert.

44:43.381 --> 44:45.616
- Jesus Christ.
Does Felipe know?

44:46.752 --> 44:48.286
- No.

45:04.369 --> 45:08.706
- If I help you
with your father,

45:08.740 --> 45:11.376
will you promise
to leave my family alone?

45:13.879 --> 45:14.913
- What do you mean?

45:17.082 --> 45:20.551
- I can get you information
about Potter

45:20.585 --> 45:23.789
and you can use it against him
as leverage.

45:23.822 --> 45:25.290
- What information?

45:25.323 --> 45:28.459
- You have to promise me, EZ.

45:28.493 --> 45:30.896
No matter what you believe
happened to your mother,

45:30.929 --> 45:33.264
you won't hurt Miguel.

45:34.800 --> 45:35.901
- What do you have on Potter?

45:39.570 --> 45:42.240
- I know Miguel wants to use it
to save Adelita,

45:42.273 --> 45:44.309
so there's not much time.

45:44.342 --> 45:46.411
Think about it.

45:46.444 --> 45:47.612
Please.

45:49.147 --> 45:50.748
If you want to save
your father, let me know.

45:50.782 --> 45:51.850
Soon.

46:02.961 --> 46:04.796
- Mom!

46:04.830 --> 46:07.065
- Hey, fucker.
- Ah!

46:46.237 --> 46:47.638
- I love you, brother.

46:49.140 --> 46:50.341
Forgive me.

47:18.769 --> 47:20.738
- Code blue, code blue.

47:20.771 --> 47:21.739
- All right, stand back.

47:21.772 --> 47:22.974
- What's happening?

47:23.008 --> 47:24.575
- You need to leave, sir.

47:26.577 --> 47:27.545
- Start compressions.

47:27.578 --> 47:28.546
- Still in V-fib.

47:28.579 --> 47:30.381
- Prep epi.

47:31.917 --> 47:33.318
- Get another amp.

48:03.414 --> 48:05.850
- Thanks, Chucky.
- Of course.

48:05.883 --> 48:08.353
Anything you need,
Johnny Coco Cruz,

48:08.386 --> 48:09.554
I'm here.

48:13.591 --> 48:15.126
- Just talked with Taza.

48:16.928 --> 48:18.896
Riz didn't make it.

48:18.930 --> 48:21.066
Died 15 minutes ago.

48:21.099 --> 48:22.433
His lungs gave up.

48:28.406 --> 48:29.975
Call the Kings.

48:30.008 --> 48:31.709
Tell them the vote
is null and void.

48:34.479 --> 48:35.413
We're going to war.

49:13.551 --> 49:14.685
- What are you doing?

49:14.719 --> 49:16.421
- Looking for photos.

49:16.454 --> 49:17.888
- Of what?
- Of Galindo's mom.

49:23.328 --> 49:24.195
- In the journal.

50:18.716 --> 50:20.351
- Hey.

50:20.385 --> 50:21.852
Hey!

50:25.456 --> 50:28.459
- It wasn't Miguel who knew Mom
and Dad were here.

50:35.233 --> 50:37.001
It was Dita.

50:37.034 --> 50:39.870
- Why the fuck would she tell
her old man about the affair?

50:44.909 --> 50:46.577
- She didn't.

50:50.548 --> 50:52.083
You said
she couldn't let it go.

50:53.918 --> 50:55.586
That she was devastated
20 years later.

50:58.723 --> 51:00.791
Dita ordered the hit.

51:05.496 --> 51:07.932
That's why she used someone
on this side.

51:07.965 --> 51:09.600
The money orders,
the household accounts,

51:09.634 --> 51:10.768
no follow-ups.

51:13.938 --> 51:15.973
If Miguel or Jose hired
the gunman,

51:16.006 --> 51:17.575
then none of us would be here.

51:21.346 --> 51:22.647
It was her, Pop.

51:34.359 --> 51:36.594
- I'm so sorry.

51:40.831 --> 51:42.099
I'm sorry.

51:42.133 --> 51:44.302
- Oh, God.

51:49.674 --> 51:51.309
God.

52:50.601 --> 52:54.372
(hard rock music plays)

52:56.374 --> 52:58.909
Esta es mi familia.

53:02.780 --> 53:05.716
This... is my family.

53:05.750 --> 53:08.085
(laughing)

53:08.853 --> 53:11.055
You either get in line...

53:11.088 --> 53:13.090
Or you get run out.

53:13.123 --> 53:15.460
ALL: Divided, we fall.
United, we roll.

53:17.061 --> 53:20.431
ANNOUNCER: Mayans.
All new Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

53:23.067 --> 53:25.703
-I'm cold.
-It's not cold. Just come to me.

53:25.736 --> 53:28.205
-I'll keep you warm, I promise.
-Fine.

53:28.239 --> 53:29.774
(woman giggling)

53:30.908 --> 53:31.942
(woman screams)

53:31.976 --> 53:33.978
ANNOUNCER: AHS 1984.

53:34.078 --> 53:36.447
All new,
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FX.

53:37.915 --> 53:39.550
-(recorder playing theme song)
-(babbling)
