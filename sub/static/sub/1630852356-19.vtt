09:43.333 --> 09:46.169
‐It's dry erase.
‐That was smart of you.

09:46.169 --> 09:49.005
Yeah, and I pruned up
my fingers in the fountain.

09:49.005 --> 09:53.134
Oh, dang it! Now I gotta come up
with a different old lady getup.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.512
Till, sweetie, you gotta
take it down a notch.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.681
Hey, remember that embarrassing
tattoo I was telling you about?

09:58.681 --> 10:01.976
‐Uh‐huh.
‐Look, here.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.354
[Tilly] Hey, I thought you
said it was embarrassing.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.023
It says it right there.
This pig is radical.

10:07.023 --> 10:10.610
Thanks, sweetie. But I got him
for all the wrong reasons.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.655
I was trying to prove to other
people that I was grown up.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.406
‐Did it work?
‐I don't know.

10:15.406 --> 10:18.076
Doing stuff like this
for other people's
benefit stinks.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.745
Later I learned that what
I thought of myself

10:20.745 --> 10:22.997
mattered more than what other
people thought of me.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.791
Huh. I see.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.584
That's when I got this guy.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.419
Self respect pig!

10:28.419 --> 10:31.422
Anyways, you're the most
mature girl I've ever known.

10:31.422 --> 10:34.509
So who cares if some people
are too dumb to see it?

10:34.509 --> 10:37.178
‐Thank you, Mama.
‐So you ready to go home?

10:37.178 --> 10:39.514
I'm sure your dad
has some zucchini left.

10:39.514 --> 10:42.600
Um, can we actually make one
more stop on the way out?

10:42.600 --> 10:45.019
‐[clicking]
‐[Tilly] Ow. Ow.

10:45.019 --> 10:48.022
Thanks again!
So, Tilly, how do you feel?

10:48.022 --> 10:50.358
Well, I feel... pretty great.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.026
Thanks, Mama.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.403
You're gonna
keep them covered up?

10:53.403 --> 10:56.197
Yep, I got 'em for me,
not for others.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.991
Now, we just gotta
wait for Saxon.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.325
[clicking]

10:59.325 --> 11:01.119
[Tilly] Good lookin' studs, bud.
