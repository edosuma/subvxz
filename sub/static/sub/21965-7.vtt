Maple trees like this one

00:02.458 --> 00:06.709
store sap in their trunks.

00:06.750 --> 00:09.417
We use a pump

00:06.750 --> 00:09.417
to draw the liquid out.

( pump whirring )

00:12.875 --> 00:14.875
(  upbeat theme playing  )

00:19.583 --> 00:23.208
Maple sap is mainly water,

00:19.583 --> 00:23.208
so we need this machine

00:23.250 --> 00:24.834
to remove most of the moisture--

00:24.875 --> 00:28.333
Leaving pure

00:24.875 --> 00:28.333
maple syrup! Yum.

00:28.375 --> 00:31.834
You refuse carrot soup,

00:28.375 --> 00:31.834
yet you enjoy this plant liquid.

00:31.875 --> 00:34.375
Because it's awesome

00:31.875 --> 00:34.375
on pancakes.

Welcome to the annual

00:42.875 --> 00:47.583
Griffin Rock Syrup Harvest!

00:47.625 --> 00:49.667
Huxley,

00:47.625 --> 00:49.667
are you getting this?

00:49.709 --> 00:52.625
Of course,

00:49.709 --> 00:52.625
Mayor Luskey!

00:52.667 --> 00:54.417
Because nothing says

00:52.667 --> 00:54.417
prime time anchor

00:54.458 --> 00:56.542
like watching

00:54.458 --> 00:56.542
the sap run.

00:56.583 --> 00:58.583
(  dramatic theme playing  )

01:04.875 --> 01:06.542
Chief Burns!

01:06.583 --> 01:09.375
Ugh. This guy.

01:09.417 --> 01:11.417
Have you given any more

01:09.417 --> 01:11.417
thought to participating

01:11.458 --> 01:15.625
in my reality show?

01:11.458 --> 01:15.625
I have the perfect title...

01:15.667 --> 01:19.291
Huxley Prescott's Bots!

01:20.500 --> 01:21.750
Bots?

01:21.792 --> 01:23.834
A TV series about us?

01:23.875 --> 01:26.458
They're not your Bots,

01:23.875 --> 01:26.458
Mr. Prescott,

01:26.500 --> 01:28.500
and my answer is still no.

01:28.542 --> 01:30.458
Rescue work is dangerous.

01:30.500 --> 01:33.375
That's what makes it

01:30.500 --> 01:33.375
great TV!

01:33.417 --> 01:35.333
( light applause )

01:35.375 --> 01:38.583
Yeah, all right,

01:35.375 --> 01:38.583
all right. Simmer.

01:38.625 --> 01:42.583
I'm happy to pour

01:38.625 --> 01:42.583
from this season's first bottle

01:42.625 --> 01:45.291
of liquid gold!

What does this bad omen say

02:59.333 --> 03:03.542
about the syrup harvest?

Only that the maples have

Chief, next year,

03:20.500 --> 03:23.667
remind me to cut back

03:20.500 --> 03:23.667
on the butter.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.166
This syrup

03:28.625 --> 03:31.166
is amazingly sticky.

03:31.208 --> 03:33.917
Oh-oh-oh-oh, make sure

03:31.208 --> 03:33.917
he's squeaky clean, Cody.

03:33.959 --> 03:38.166
We need to look our best

03:33.959 --> 03:38.166
for my-- our reality debut.

03:38.208 --> 03:40.500
I sincerely doubt that Chief

03:38.208 --> 03:40.500
will allow our rescue work

03:40.542 --> 03:43.750
to become entertainment.

03:40.542 --> 03:43.750
He is not fond of lookie-loos.

03:43.792 --> 03:45.750
Neither is Optimus.

03:45.792 --> 03:48.625
But a TV series is our chance

03:45.792 --> 03:48.625
to be famous.

03:48.667 --> 03:50.375
Huxley would be famous.

03:50.417 --> 03:52.834
We'd be pretending

03:50.417 --> 03:52.834
to be mindless tin cans.

03:52.875 --> 03:54.917
It's called acting.

03:54.959 --> 03:56.500
CODY:

03:54.959 --> 03:56.500
Sorry, Blades.

03:56.542 --> 03:58.834
Dad says cameras at a rescue

03:56.542 --> 03:58.834
aren't safe.

03:58.875 --> 04:00.834
Plus, there's no way

03:58.875 --> 04:00.834
the Mayor would put

04:00.875 --> 04:03.667
Griffin Rock's top secret tech

04:00.875 --> 04:03.667
on network TV.

04:03.709 --> 04:05.333
What about cable?

04:05.375 --> 04:08.291
(  upbeat theme playing  )

04:08.333 --> 04:12.417
Oh... How many different ways

04:08.333 --> 04:12.417
can I say no, Huxley?

04:12.458 --> 04:16.417
Before you say it in Swahili,

04:12.458 --> 04:16.417
take a look at this.

04:16.458 --> 04:18.750
(  upbeat theme playing  )

04:27.458 --> 04:30.917
HUXLEY:

04:27.458 --> 04:30.917
Heroes need a spotlight

04:27.458 --> 04:30.917
to become legends.

04:30.959 --> 04:34.333
Mayor, you are

04:30.959 --> 04:34.333
that legend-in-waiting.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.959
Look at that face.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.750
The camera simply loves you!

04:40.291 --> 04:41.667
Well, uh...

04:41.709 --> 04:44.875
maybe just a pilot episode.

04:41.709 --> 04:44.875
Heh, heh.

04:49.625 --> 04:52.625
CHIEF:

04:49.625 --> 04:52.625
I don't know how he did it,

04:49.625 --> 04:52.625
but despite government protocol,

04:52.667 --> 04:54.917
island security

04:52.667 --> 04:54.917
and common sense,

04:54.959 --> 04:58.417

full access to our team.

05:08.750 --> 05:12.041
to each of you.

05:14.333 --> 05:18.000
Yeah, just make sure to get

05:14.333 --> 05:18.000
my good side--both of 'em.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I'm feeling very self conscious.

05:23.667 --> 05:27.291
Ahem. Um, wrist joint's

05:23.667 --> 05:27.291
acting up.

05:27.333 --> 05:30.417
Let's get one thing straight,

05:27.333 --> 05:30.417
Huxley.

05:30.458 --> 05:33.375
Access isn't permission

05:30.458 --> 05:33.375
to interfere.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.291
You're only here

05:33.417 --> 05:35.291
to observe.

05:35.333 --> 05:36.792
Of course, Chief.

05:36.834 --> 05:39.750
My equipment will follow

05:36.834 --> 05:39.750
your team at a safe distance.

05:39.792 --> 05:41.500
I'll conduct

Anything

05:43.417 --> 05:45.417
I can help with, Dad?

Why don't you make sure

05:45.458 --> 05:47.500
the bots are...

05:47.542 --> 05:49.375
primed for the cameras.

05:53.041 --> 05:55.583
Chief Burns,

05:53.041 --> 05:55.583
what dangers do you look for

05:55.625 --> 05:58.417
( via camera ):

05:55.625 --> 05:58.417
when patrolling the mean

05:55.625 --> 05:58.417
streets of Griffin Rock?

05:58.458 --> 06:00.542
I don't look for danger.

06:00.583 --> 06:02.583
I just try to be ready

06:00.583 --> 06:02.583
if it happens.

06:02.625 --> 06:05.625
Because who knows

06:02.625 --> 06:05.625
where peril may strike.

06:16.917 --> 06:19.458
About once a month,

06:19.500 --> 06:22.709

06:22.750 --> 06:24.208
do that.

06:46.041 --> 06:49.083
missed the red light back there.

06:53.959 --> 06:56.333
But...you call that

06:53.959 --> 06:56.333
a police pursuit?

06:56.375 --> 06:59.333
It lasted...

06:56.375 --> 06:59.333
1.2 seconds.

06:59.375 --> 07:01.583
Sorry to disappoint you,

06:59.375 --> 07:01.583

at our jobs.

I'm just trying to come up

with my catchphrase, Dani.

has one.

Oh, how about,

How about,

people!

08:19.750 --> 08:21.834
I am confused by

Mr. Prescott's behavior.

08:21.875 --> 08:25.458
He seemed upset I apprehended

08:21.875 --> 08:25.458
a speeder in record time.

08:25.500 --> 08:29.417
Yeah. He didn't like how quickly

08:25.500 --> 08:29.417
I saved Mr. Pettypaws either.

08:29.458 --> 08:31.959
I didn't know there was such

As long as it's safe.

08:33.834 --> 08:36.625
I think Huxley's more interested

08:33.834 --> 08:36.625
in what makes good TV

08:36.667 --> 08:38.458
than what makes

08:36.667 --> 08:38.458
good rescue work.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.959
Well, why can't

08:38.500 --> 08:39.959
we give him both?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.709
Get the job done,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.709
but do it with style.

08:42.750 --> 08:43.959
Ha-cha!

08:49.250 --> 08:51.250
(  soft dramatic theme playing  )

( camera whooshes )

08:55.792 --> 08:57.709
HUXLEY:

08:55.792 --> 08:57.709
And what thrilling

08:55.792 --> 08:57.709
new invention

08:57.750 --> 08:59.458
are you working on,

08:57.750 --> 08:59.458
Graham?

08:59.500 --> 09:03.542
Uh, my engineering homework?

09:03.583 --> 09:05.917
( gasps ):

09:03.583 --> 09:05.917
That was close.

09:05.959 --> 09:09.792
This Squilsh is pretty dangerous

09:05.959 --> 09:09.792
unless it stays vacuum-sealed.

09:09.834 --> 09:13.834
Uh... Squilsh sucks up

09:09.834 --> 09:13.834
everything it touches.

09:13.875 --> 09:16.959
It once soaked up

09:13.875 --> 09:16.959
an entire swimming pool.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.083
It was actually pretty gross.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.583
Uh... Want to see photos?

09:21.625 --> 09:24.959
Yeah,

09:21.625 --> 09:24.959
I need to recharge my cameras.

09:27.542 --> 09:29.625
( sighs ):

09:27.542 --> 09:29.625
Okay, everyone,

09:29.667 --> 09:31.750
prying eyes are closed for now.

09:31.792 --> 09:34.000
( all sigh )

09:31.792 --> 09:34.000
Finally.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.917
Oh...

09:34.041 --> 09:36.917
What if there's an emergency?

09:36.959 --> 09:40.083
Rescue Bots are always at the

09:36.959 --> 09:40.083
ready should calamity strike.

09:40.125 --> 09:42.166
But the cameras aren't.

09:42.208 --> 09:44.125
Our fans

09:42.208 --> 09:44.125
will want to see everything.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.750
We don't have fans.

09:45.792 --> 09:47.709
Yet.

09:45.792 --> 09:47.709
( device beeps )

09:47.750 --> 09:50.834
Hey, team, someone needs

09:47.750 --> 09:50.834
to get to the zoo, now.

09:50.875 --> 09:53.625
Nancy Morrison fell

09:50.875 --> 09:53.625

10:09.291 --> 10:12.542
to join his circle of life.

10:29.125 --> 10:31.000
In nature programs,

10:31.041 --> 10:33.166
that often means

10:31.041 --> 10:33.166
a lion's about to...

10:33.208 --> 10:35.208
(  tense theme playing  )

10:37.000 --> 10:39.333
Never quite got the syrup

10:37.000 --> 10:39.333

10:54.291 --> 10:56.625
Aw...

10:56.667 --> 11:00.000
Chief Burns! Why didn't you

10:56.667 --> 11:00.000
tell me you were planning this?

11:00.041 --> 11:02.542
A distressed child,

11:00.041 --> 11:02.542
a ferocious beast...

11:02.583 --> 11:04.959
I mean, that's must-see TV!

11:05.000 --> 11:07.917
Planning? Huxley,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.917
we respond to emergencies,

11:07.959 --> 11:09.959
we don't create them.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.834
Oh, you don't...

11:12.875 --> 11:15.083
but someone else could.

11:17.041 --> 11:18.625
Dad, we got a call.

11:18.667 --> 11:21.250
The bank

11:18.667 --> 11:21.250
was just robbed!

11:21.291 --> 11:23.291
( siren blaring )

11:24.959 --> 11:26.750
Cody,

11:24.959 --> 11:26.750
any alarms triggered?

11:26.792 --> 11:29.709
No, and I can't see anything

11:26.792 --> 11:29.709
wrong on the security cameras.

11:29.750 --> 11:33.250
The tipster said the thieves

11:29.750 --> 11:33.250
took off in an armored car.

11:33.291 --> 11:34.542
( beeping )

11:34.583 --> 11:36.583
CODY:

11:34.583 --> 11:36.583
Dad, I see one on Lake Street!

CHASE:

11:46.625 --> 11:49.667
Exit the armored vehicle

11:46.625 --> 11:49.667
with your extremities raised.

11:51.834 --> 11:54.333
Jerry?

11:54.375 --> 11:58.375
Sorry, Chief. Uh, I was just

11:54.375 --> 11:58.375
running my regular route.

11:58.417 --> 11:59.834
Was I speeding?

11:59.875 --> 12:03.250
No, but it looks like

11:59.875 --> 12:03.250
we have a prank caller.

12:03.291 --> 12:04.875
Cody, can you trace that tip?

12:04.917 --> 12:07.500
On it, Dad.

12:04.917 --> 12:07.500
Let me know what you find.

12:07.542 --> 12:10.375
Though I already have

12:07.542 --> 12:10.375
my suspicions.

12:15.333 --> 12:18.000
Uh, my engineering

12:15.333 --> 12:18.000
homework?

12:18.041 --> 12:19.917
No!

12:19.959 --> 12:22.875
Viewers would skip through this

12:19.959 --> 12:22.875
show to get to the commercials.

12:22.917 --> 12:25.667
I need bigger, epic.

Something...

12:26.959 --> 12:28.375
...pretty dangerous.

(  dramatic theme playing  )

12:29.875 --> 12:31.291
That was close.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.959
This Squilsh

12:31.333 --> 12:33.959
is pretty dangerous.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.875
( grunting )

12:56.917 --> 13:01.291
How's this? I turn to the camera

12:56.917 --> 13:01.291
and say, "Who's your Dani?"

13:01.333 --> 13:05.375
All right, all right,

13:01.333 --> 13:05.375
how about, "It's chopper time!"

Huh? Huh?

'Cause I'm--

Not even a little fame?

It's Huxley.

No! I'm not camera-ready.

13:23.417 --> 13:25.875
No, I mean dad's suspicions

13:23.417 --> 13:25.875
were right.

13:25.917 --> 13:27.667
I traced the prank call.

He used

a voice distortion device.

13:35.792 --> 13:37.667
I am shocked to the spark.

13:43.875 --> 13:48.417
reality or TV, not both.

13:48.458 --> 13:51.709
Mr. Prescott and I

13:48.458 --> 13:51.709
need to have a little chat.

Right now.

Yes.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.041
I mean, um...

14:22.083 --> 14:25.625
Making phony emergency calls

No, no! Kade, it's real.

17:38.583 --> 17:41.125
Yeah, Cody said you might.

17:38.583 --> 17:41.125
Scoop claws ready for action,

17:41.166 --> 17:43.500
and we're at the reservoir.

17:41.166 --> 17:43.500
Hold on.

17:46.458 --> 17:48.083
( grunting )

17:48.125 --> 17:49.792
The water's trying to scoop us!

17:49.834 --> 17:52.709
That's not water.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.709
That's Squilsh!

17:52.750 --> 17:54.583
How is that possible?

17:54.625 --> 17:57.208
I have the only sample

17:54.625 --> 17:57.208
on the island.

17:59.166 --> 18:01.166
You mean you had

17:59.166 --> 18:01.166
the only sample.

18:01.208 --> 18:03.375
( blades grunting )

18:06.375 --> 18:10.166
Ugh. If this is what

18:06.375 --> 18:10.166
being a reality star is,

18:10.208 --> 18:12.083
I'm only auditioning

18:10.208 --> 18:12.083
for sitcoms.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.041
Cody, call Doc Green.

18:14.083 --> 18:16.041
He knows how to best handle

18:14.083 --> 18:16.041
the Squilsh.

18:16.083 --> 18:17.667
Dad, we got a bigger problem.

18:17.709 --> 18:19.667
No water, anywhere.

18:19.709 --> 18:21.417
The Squilsh must have

18:19.709 --> 18:21.417
sucked up every river

18:21.458 --> 18:23.166
that runs into

18:21.458 --> 18:23.166
the reservoir.

18:23.208 --> 18:25.792
There's no place to refill

18:23.208 --> 18:25.792
Heatwave's tanks.

18:25.834 --> 18:27.458
( groans )

18:27.500 --> 18:29.625
We can't fight a fire

18:27.500 --> 18:29.625
without water.

18:29.667 --> 18:31.583
( sap bubbling )

18:32.750 --> 18:35.667
Yes, you can.

18:32.750 --> 18:35.667
The maple grove!

18:35.709 --> 18:38.333
Cody, this is no time

18:35.709 --> 18:38.333
to be thinking about syrup.

18:38.375 --> 18:41.542
But it's the perfect time

18:38.375 --> 18:41.542
to be thinking about sap.

18:41.583 --> 18:43.709
Maple sap is mostly water.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.458
Great idea, Cody.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.417
These firebreaks

18:45.500 --> 18:48.417
should hold for a while.

18:48.458 --> 18:50.542
Dani, if the Squilsh

18:48.458 --> 18:50.542
is in the reservoir,

18:50.583 --> 18:53.458
it can't reach the ocean.

18:50.583 --> 18:53.458
Fill your scoop claw there.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.834
Everyone else,

18:53.500 --> 18:55.834
see you at the maple grove.

18:59.166 --> 19:02.208
Using a breakfast topping

18:59.166 --> 19:02.208
against a thousand degree fire.

19:02.250 --> 19:03.750
What could possibly go wrong?

19:03.792 --> 19:05.500
( pump whirring )

19:05.542 --> 19:07.417
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:11.375 --> 19:14.583
Why did I not learn this

19:11.375 --> 19:14.583
during firefighter training?

19:24.709 --> 19:26.917
Hmm, maple trees.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.500
Another wondrous example

19:26.959 --> 19:29.500
of nature's bounty.

19:29.542 --> 19:31.834
( Chase grunts )

19:31.875 --> 19:33.875
Unfortunately,

19:31.875 --> 19:33.875
they lack mobility.

19:33.917 --> 19:35.625
I don't.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.875
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:37.917 --> 19:41.625
Power up and energize!

19:48.709 --> 19:50.667
(  upbeat theme playing  )

19:53.875 --> 19:57.417
A creeping conflagration,

19:53.875 --> 19:57.417
an endangered estate!

19:57.458 --> 19:59.500
But who will save the day?

19:59.542 --> 20:01.667
I, Huxley Prescott.

20:01.709 --> 20:03.875
Newscaster.

20:01.709 --> 20:03.875
Newsmaker.

20:03.917 --> 20:06.625
And the last line of defense

20:03.917 --> 20:06.625
against--

20:06.667 --> 20:08.625
( panting ):

20:06.667 --> 20:08.625
Huxley!

20:08.667 --> 20:10.792
Why are you standing there

20:08.667 --> 20:10.792
recording this?

20:10.834 --> 20:12.834
Do something!

20:12.875 --> 20:14.959
There's a new face of heroism...

20:15.000 --> 20:16.500
this one.

20:21.792 --> 20:23.875
( sputtering )

20:25.709 --> 20:28.041
So, what's plan "B"?

20:28.083 --> 20:29.542
( screams )

20:29.583 --> 20:31.041
( blowing )

20:35.542 --> 20:37.917
Get these cameras

20:35.542 --> 20:37.917
out of here!

20:37.959 --> 20:40.333
Your show is over,

20:37.959 --> 20:40.333
Huxley!

20:40.375 --> 20:42.792
You can't stop Reality TV.

20:42.834 --> 20:44.542
Nothing can!

20:46.125 --> 20:48.000
( electricity crackling )

20:50.000 --> 20:52.709
We made quite a splash.

20:52.750 --> 20:55.000
I thought we stopped

20:52.750 --> 20:55.000
with the catchphrases?

20:56.834 --> 20:58.417
Where's Boulder?

20:58.458 --> 21:01.417
He said he'd help me

20:58.458 --> 21:01.417
pick out a book.

21:01.458 --> 21:03.750
Graham and Doc needed a hand

21:01.458 --> 21:03.750
containing the Squilsh.

21:03.792 --> 21:05.917
Why don't you just

21:03.792 --> 21:05.917
watch TV?

21:05.959 --> 21:08.667
TV has betrayed my trust.

21:08.709 --> 21:10.917
Maybe I can

21:08.709 --> 21:10.917
renew your faith.

21:13.041 --> 21:16.500
I warned you that rescue work

21:13.041 --> 21:16.500
was dangerous, Huxley.

21:16.542 --> 21:19.834
Maybe next time my advice

21:16.542 --> 21:19.834
will...stick with you?

21:19.875 --> 21:22.417
( chuckles )

21:22.458 --> 21:24.500
( sighs )

21:24.542 --> 21:26.792
( laughs )

21:26.834 --> 21:28.792
Best show ever!

21:29.917 --> 21:32.417
(  dramatic theme playing  )
