01:37.280 --> 01:40.511
Mr. Gustafson, 
I have to talk to you.

01:44.680 --> 01:47.353
Mr. Gustafson, will you answer
the door, please?

01:47.440 --> 01:49.078
I know you're in there.

01:50.320 --> 01:54.791
It's no use pretending
this isn't happening, Mr. Gustafson.

01:54.920 --> 01:59.118
I can't keep coming back here
every couple of days.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.316
You have to talk to me.

02:04.120 --> 02:07.749
Mr. Gustafson, 
I'm just trying to help you.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.270
Come on, answer the door.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.152
I'm just gonna keep knocking.

02:12.240 --> 02:15.755
I'll come back, so you might
as well answer the door.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.632
We know you're in there.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.435
Think of the neighbors, Mr. Gustafson.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.838
There's a letter for you, Mr. Gustafson.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.155
I suggest you read it.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.516
-Morning, dickhead.
-Hello, moron.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.079
What are you....

02:40.320 --> 02:41.912
Never mind. 
Just forget it.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.117
-Who's the guy yakking at your door?
-Mind your own business.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.430
"Mind your own business."

02:47.520 --> 02:49.988
Tie your shoelace.
You'll fall on your stupid head.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.229
Shut up.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.311
We're having a heat wave.

02:53.680 --> 02:57.434
We're having a heat wave
A tropical heat wave

03:01.240 --> 03:04.118
Somebody moving
into the old Clickner place.

03:07.480 --> 03:10.358
-You picked up on that, Sherlock.
-Excuse me.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.749
I wonder if you could tell me...

03:12.880 --> 03:15.269
where I could find Mr. Gustafson?

03:15.360 --> 03:17.032
Gustafson? 
No, sorry.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.190
-Mr. John Gustafson?
-That's right.

03:23.440 --> 03:28.036
You mean the lowlife, asswipe,
eggsucker John Gustafson?

03:28.800 --> 03:30.199
Have you seen him?

03:30.320 --> 03:32.390
That man's crazy. 
Loco.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.790
Always hanging out around
those kinky strip bars...

03:35.920 --> 03:38.559
where men take their clothes off.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.439
That's, of course,
if he's taken his medication.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.589
Medication?

03:43.680 --> 03:47.878
Without it, he could be anywhere.
Wandering around talking to the trees.

03:48.120 --> 03:51.476
Believe me, this man is a menace.
Always drinking, starting fights.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.039
Isn't that right?

03:53.120 --> 03:56.476
-But have you seen him?
-No, sorry.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.597
I think, perhaps...

04:02.280 --> 04:03.474
no.

04:05.400 --> 04:06.879
If you see him...

04:07.200 --> 04:09.714
would you give him this
and tell him he must contact...

04:09.800 --> 04:11.597
Mr. Snyder as soon as possible.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.639
That's me. 
It's important.

04:17.480 --> 04:20.836
Important? Yes, sir.
We'll tell him when we see him.

04:26.880 --> 04:27.869
Look out!

04:27.960 --> 04:29.109
Watch out for that ice.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.952
Very slippery.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.109
Right.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.478
Holy moly.

04:42.120 --> 04:43.189
Jesus.

04:51.760 --> 04:54.228
A men's strip joint?

04:57.400 --> 04:58.594
Idiot.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.279
Thirty days.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.108
That's just great.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.833
...this Remington MicroScreen
Rechargeable Shaver so much...

05:51.920 --> 05:53.069
I bought the company.

05:53.160 --> 05:56.311
It shaves as close as a blade,
or I'll give you your money back.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.278
The first microscreen is so thin
it sha ves incredibly close.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.954
The second even closer.
Remington 's American--

06:02.040 --> 06:05.874
You should ha ve seen Mrs. Carlson 's face
when he said "It's a keeper. "

06:05.960 --> 06:08.349
Oh, cold enough for you?

06:09.560 --> 06:11.118
Shut up, fat-ass.

06:11.200 --> 06:15.512
It's not even Thanksgiving, and we're
enjoying our lovely fall weather.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.909
Six inches of snow
on the ground already...

06:18.000 --> 06:21.072
with tra veler's advisories
in effect throughout our area tonight...

06:21.160 --> 06:24.277
you'd be advised to stay inside
and ha ve yourself...

06:24.360 --> 06:26.237
a warm, home-cooked meal.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.316
Here's what's coming up this week.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.392
It's snow, snow, and more snow.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.677
We've got snow coming into
our area all week long.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.354
Come Sunday afternoon,
another cold front....

07:16.080 --> 07:17.672
What the hell!

07:58.120 --> 08:00.680
Holy moly.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.517
Oh, my God.

08:33.840 --> 08:36.912
You're still using
that beat-up piece of firewood?

08:37.480 --> 08:41.871
The Green Hornet's caught more fish
than you've lied about, Gustafson.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.074
You see her?

08:45.600 --> 08:48.239
Drives pretty fast on that snowmobile.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.356
Pretty damn fast.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.716
Did you hear about Eddie Hicks?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.791
Hypothermia's a bitch.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.871
Not quick like a stroke.

08:58.240 --> 09:01.357
A stroke is no damn good.
You could end up like a vegetable.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.635
Give me a cardiac any day.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.592
You know what Jacob said?

09:06.320 --> 09:09.710
Jacob said that old Billy Hinshel
was killed in a car crash.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.991
Head-on collision with a freight truck.

09:12.080 --> 09:15.356
Cleared his car straight over the bridge
into the Mississippi.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.839
Lucky bastard.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.428
You bet.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.679
How is he anyway?

09:21.160 --> 09:23.230
He's dead. 
Died on impact.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.675
Jacob, moron. Jacob.

09:26.040 --> 09:27.837
Oh, he's fine.

09:27.960 --> 09:30.110
Doing real good. 
Real busy and everything.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.350
He promised to come over
for Thanksgiving.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.158
Is he really running for Mayor?

09:34.240 --> 09:37.516
-Make a damn fine mayor, too.
-It's a good thing he's his mother's son.

09:37.600 --> 09:40.068
If he looked like you,
he'd never get on the ballot.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.752
Eat my shorts.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.638
-Morning, Mrs. Truax.
-Morning, how are you doing?

09:44.720 --> 09:46.119
Holy moly.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.276
-Watch your step there, ma'am.
-Thank you.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.591
Jesus Quincy Adams.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.151
I hit the cans again.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.634
I heard.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.558
How is the Grinch today?

10:27.640 --> 10:31.428
Ain't got a pot to piss in
or a window to throw it out of.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.039
Can I get you something?

10:33.120 --> 10:35.429
A six-pack of Schmidt and some bait.

10:35.520 --> 10:39.354
-Shiners or wax worms?
-I can't afford shiners, give me the worms.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.158
The worms are 75 cents.

10:41.240 --> 10:45.711
75 cents? Crime in ltaly. Chuck,
we're talking about worms not caviar.

10:45.880 --> 10:48.348
You go through that every time.

10:48.440 --> 10:53.070
Where are you going to get worms this
time of year? It's supply and demand.

10:53.160 --> 10:56.072
You could retire in Florida
just from selling me worms.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.639
Throw the beef jerky in, too.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.109
That's $5 for the beer and the worms.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.794
Your old gut can't handle jerky.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.279
Goddamn.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.996
Is Pop out there at the shanty?

11:07.400 --> 11:08.594
Always.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.394
And the moron?

11:10.640 --> 11:13.108
There's lots of ice out there, Gustafson.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.071
Should be room enough
for the both of you.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.355
"Lots of ice out there, Gustafson."

11:48.440 --> 11:49.919
Hi, Dad.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.589
Any luck today?

11:51.680 --> 11:54.911
How the hell should I know?
I just got here.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.874
Mel, she came by the other day...

11:57.960 --> 11:59.996
and said you'd been snapping.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.958
Like a catfish.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.270
I've had a lot on my mind lately.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.271
I'll tell what's on my mind.

12:06.440 --> 12:10.194
It's butt-cold out here
and I'm fresh out of beer.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.913
Someone moved into the Clickner place.
A woman.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.439
A woman?

12:16.160 --> 12:18.720
-Did you mount her?
-Oh, Dad.

12:18.840 --> 12:21.434
Does she have big thighs?

12:23.960 --> 12:25.757
Then what's the problem?

12:25.960 --> 12:28.838
If I was a young fellow like you,
I'd be mounting...

12:28.920 --> 12:31.912
every woman in Wabasha.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.712
Keep the change.

12:39.160 --> 12:40.593
Hi, Punky.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.119
Hi, John.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.754
The Green Hornet strikes again.

13:50.440 --> 13:51.953
Caught my limit.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.951
You only snagged one.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.474
Two fish are on there, 
you bonehead.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.949
I throw back what 
I'm not going to eat.

13:59.040 --> 14:02.669
Yeah, like that 40-pound muskie
you're always yakking about.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.752
It's a shame nobody ever sees you
with these monsters.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.877
You're gonna love it, Goldman.

14:18.280 --> 14:19.952
Go to work, baby.

14:30.680 --> 14:31.874
What is it?

14:35.280 --> 14:37.430
Oh, my God, they've come for me.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.671
Oh, my God. I....

15:09.360 --> 15:10.873
You see, I was....

15:12.720 --> 15:15.075
I hope you don't mind,
but I saw your light on...

15:15.160 --> 15:17.720
and I was wondering
if I might use your bathroom.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.079
What?

15:22.600 --> 15:26.195
-Your toilet is broken?
-No, thank goodness.

15:26.760 --> 15:31.117
I don't know, the house seemed so empty
tonight. I do so love bathrooms.

15:31.320 --> 15:34.596
Did you know you can tell a lot
about a person from his bathroom?

15:34.680 --> 15:36.193
I didn't know that.

15:36.280 --> 15:39.158
There it is.
I can't wait to see what I find in there.

15:39.360 --> 15:41.555
Much better than having your palm read.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.592
Give me 30 seconds
in a person's bathroom...

15:44.720 --> 15:47.792
and I'll give you a complete
and accurate profile.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.197
-There's a guest bathroom, please.
-I'll only be a minute.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.389
So?

16:26.320 --> 16:27.514
Fascinating.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.917
Don't you think it's time
you finally introduced yourself?

16:33.960 --> 16:35.518
John Gustafson, right?

16:38.120 --> 16:41.317
I took some of your mail yesterday
to find out who you were.

16:41.400 --> 16:45.871
But you don't get much and
what you do get doesn't paint a picture.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.758
-Taking mail is a federal offense.
-I know.

16:49.240 --> 16:52.038
Sometimes you must go a long distance
out of the way...

16:52.120 --> 16:54.680
in order to return
a short distance correctly.

16:54.760 --> 16:57.479
Don't you find that, too? I love that line.

16:57.560 --> 17:01.712
I have to confess it's not mine.
It's from The Zoo Story by Edward Albee.

17:01.800 --> 17:05.109
I teach American literature
at Winona State University.

17:05.200 --> 17:08.476
I started yesterday.
I love the classics, don't you?

17:08.560 --> 17:12.394
-Well, I also read Field & Stream.
-lndeed?

17:12.480 --> 17:15.358
You have a whole library
up there from what I could see.

17:15.560 --> 17:20.474
There's something really rugged
and virile about the outdoors.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.271
My manners. 
I'm sorry.

17:25.359 --> 17:26.759
I'm Ariel Truax.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.634
How do you do? 
I'm John Gustafson.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.438
Yes, I know.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.436
When did you
move into the Clickner place?

17:34.520 --> 17:36.317
I'm sure you know that.

17:36.440 --> 17:39.159
Since I got here, you and Max Goldman...

17:39.240 --> 17:44.030
have been stuck up against your windows
watching me like two Garfield cats.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.588
Like the kind
people stick to their car windows.

17:46.680 --> 17:49.114
The little suction cups they have....

17:49.200 --> 17:50.349
Squirrels.

17:50.600 --> 17:54.275
Been watching squirrels. One's been
making a nest under your eaves.

17:54.360 --> 17:55.759
Sure, John.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.273
Here's your mail.

17:57.360 --> 18:00.033
There's nothing addressed
to a Mrs. Gustafson.

18:00.120 --> 18:03.317
By the state of your bathroom,
I presume you're a bachelor.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.599
Gay or straight?

18:07.320 --> 18:09.151
Heterosexual or homosexual?

18:09.960 --> 18:11.598
Jeez Louise....

18:11.680 --> 18:13.830
It's a perfectly legitimate question.

18:15.040 --> 18:18.157
Maybe in California
but here in Minnesota....

18:18.600 --> 18:20.272
Have I upset you?

18:22.600 --> 18:25.353
It's the middle of the night
and I don't know what....

18:25.440 --> 18:27.078
Do you want me to leave?

18:27.160 --> 18:29.151
No. Yes.

18:31.480 --> 18:34.199
It was very nice meeting you,
John Gustafson.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.472
And now that we know each other,
don't be a stranger, neighbor.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.039
Oh, and John...

18:40.400 --> 18:42.675
king's rook to queen's bishop three.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.552
Don't ring that up yet.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.632
I need something for my lumbago.
The pain is killing me.

19:19.720 --> 19:23.998
It's killing you, my ass. He doesn't
know the meaning of the word pain.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.914
I got a pinched sciatica that makes
your lumbago look like eye strain.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.150
Pain. He wants to talk about pain.

19:30.240 --> 19:33.437
I had a gallstone the size of a baseball.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.878
Gallstones are for pussies.

19:37.080 --> 19:40.072
When I had shingles
did you see me complain to Phil?

19:40.160 --> 19:42.469
-Did you?
-Shingles schmingles.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.949
When I had my ulcers, I was...

19:45.720 --> 19:48.188
farting razor blades.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.791
Good morning, John.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.595
You must be Max Goldman.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.558
Hi, I'm Ariel Truax, your new neighbor.

19:57.640 --> 19:58.755
Pleasure.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.871
Isn't it a peach of a day?

20:01.440 --> 20:03.271
Listen, I have something for you.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.994
It was dropped off
at my house by accident.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.798
Some of your mail.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.191
Here you are. Sorry.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.918
Have my herbal therapy oils arrived yet?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.479
They arrived this morning.

20:15.680 --> 20:18.148
Special delivery from California.

20:18.760 --> 20:19.988
Wonderful.

20:20.440 --> 20:23.398
Yes, there's nothing like the scent of...

20:24.120 --> 20:25.917
fresh tea tree...

20:26.040 --> 20:28.554
just soaking into your pores.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.039
Don't you agree?

20:30.120 --> 20:31.519
Lovely.

20:32.400 --> 20:35.278
Thank you.
It was such a pleasure meeting you...

20:35.360 --> 20:38.113
and I'm sure we're going to see
a lot of one another.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.439
Goodbye, gentlemen. Goodbye, John.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.911
Holy moly.

20:48.560 --> 20:51.233
Now wait. You got all
four wheels on the track?

20:51.320 --> 20:53.311
All right. Careful, fellas.

20:54.400 --> 20:58.393
Be careful. That's over 100 years old.
Damn thing might collapse.

20:58.480 --> 21:01.074
-Hi, sweetheart. How are you?
-Hi, Dad.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.799
-There's Granddaddy's little girl.
-What's going on?

21:04.160 --> 21:07.789
-I'm getting rid of that. It's just firewood.
-Why?

21:07.880 --> 21:11.395
I don't know. I don't play it much.
It sits around collecting dust.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.959
You love that piano.

21:13.040 --> 21:16.430
Granddaddy's got a surprise
for you in the house, pumpkin.

21:16.920 --> 21:20.037
Just a little C-A-N-D-Y.
It's not going to kill her.

21:23.920 --> 21:24.989
Which one?

21:25.240 --> 21:27.356
Which hand? This one?

21:28.720 --> 21:30.119
That's the one.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.633
There you are, sweet pea.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.472
-How about that? Here.
-Dad.

21:35.520 --> 21:39.035
-ls there something wrong?
-No. Nothing's wrong at all.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.193
With me....

21:50.560 --> 21:53.074
-People are asking about you.
-I know.

21:53.280 --> 21:57.114
Yeah, I keep telling them
that you and Mike are doing just fine.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.509
It's just a lot of gum-flapping.

22:00.320 --> 22:04.074
-Mike and I aren't fine.
-That's what I thought.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.830
We're gonna separate for a while.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.752
Honey, marriage isn't easy.
You got to work at it.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.755
It's hard to work at it
when he's never there.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.752
Sounds familiar. Mother wondered
where I was for 20 years.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.355
You really think I wanted two jobs?
I didn't do that for me.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.715
I was doing it for you, Brian, your mother.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.792
Dad, this isn't about you.
It's about me and Mike.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.237
I'm sorry. I keep....

22:37.880 --> 22:40.269
I'm sorry. I love you so much.

22:42.280 --> 22:45.477
Well, whatever you and Mike decide is....

22:47.880 --> 22:49.552
I never liked him anyway.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.632
Who is that?

23:04.600 --> 23:06.318
I don't know.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.111
She seems to know you.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.878
-Does she always do that?
-I don't know.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.237
This is great.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.958
We hope you enjoyed
our feature presentation.

23:43.040 --> 23:46.237
Now stay tuned for tonight's $6.4 million...

23:46.320 --> 23:48.311
jackpot on Powerball.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.232
Followed by local news.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.469
Out of the way.

23:51.560 --> 23:55.155
Come on, baby. I've got to win $1 million.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.515
Who's that?

24:14.120 --> 24:15.997
Jacob, you got my vote. 
That's terrific.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.629
Come on in. Have a little TV dinner.
Lasagna's heating up now.

24:19.720 --> 24:22.632
No time. I just dropped by to give you
this placard for the yard.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.119
I have to deliver a lot.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.872
Just have one drink.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.992
I can't. Sorry. I'll call you.

24:28.080 --> 24:30.071
No, close the door. Come in.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.515
Wait a minute. Give me a minute.

24:32.680 --> 24:37.151
I'll be with you in a second. I have to do
something here that's very important.

24:37.400 --> 24:40.472
$6.4 million is our estimated jackpot.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.357
You could be our next millionaire.

24:49.400 --> 24:54.269
To win the jackpot, correctly match
five white balls and the red powerball.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.351
Our first number is a--

25:04.320 --> 25:05.912
What's going on?

25:07.320 --> 25:08.309
Seven.

25:08.400 --> 25:11.676
Number four. Remember, to win
the jackpot, match 5 white balls...

25:11.760 --> 25:13.318
and the red powerball.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.154
Come on.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.157
Schmuck doesn't know what's happening.

25:19.240 --> 25:20.434
...a 25.

25:20.520 --> 25:24.513
There's just one more white ball
and here it is--

25:27.560 --> 25:29.278
Jesus Christ.

25:34.800 --> 25:35.994
Goldman.

25:37.640 --> 25:39.232
Goldman. It's Goldman.

25:39.520 --> 25:40.714
You're a child.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.916
Don't tell me. 
It isn't me.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.558
It never is.

25:44.680 --> 25:47.114
I'm sure John started every fight
since 1940.

25:47.320 --> 25:48.309
Thirty eight.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.471
It's ridiculous.

25:54.480 --> 25:55.879
Come over here and apologize.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.996
-Come here.
-I'm not apologizing to anybody.

25:58.080 --> 26:00.036
You're letting the cold air in.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.192
Take that, you criminal.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.474
I don't believe it. 
That old trick?

26:29.880 --> 26:34.476
This is between me and your father.
There's no need for you to get involved.

26:35.360 --> 26:38.318
I don't say anything on one condition.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.311
Put one of these in your yard.

26:41.280 --> 26:42.872
I'd be proud to.

26:42.960 --> 26:45.872
Hey, not one word
to your old man, remember?

26:49.360 --> 26:50.713
Have fun, Johnny.

27:07.560 --> 27:09.676
Hey, dickhead, you win the lottery?

27:11.560 --> 27:13.869
Enjoy your shower, smartass?

27:33.480 --> 27:36.278
Got to use hot water, you schmuck.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.118
You'll never get me.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.717
See you later.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.516
Up yours, Gustafson.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.795
What the hell is that smell?

28:25.520 --> 28:27.431
Watch it, bonehead.

28:37.520 --> 28:40.318
Mrs. Cusack over at the store
said she came in yesterday...

28:40.400 --> 28:42.595
to buy some candles and incense.

28:43.120 --> 28:46.635
Ask me, she's probably a member
of one of them religious cults.

28:46.800 --> 28:49.314
-You say she's all alone?
-What I heard.

28:49.400 --> 28:52.278
She's available and hot to trot.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.271
-Moron.
-Putz.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.195
Max was telling me
about your new neighbor.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.349
What?

29:05.440 --> 29:09.752
My new neighbor? Oh, yes, new neighbor.
She came over to see me last night.

29:09.920 --> 29:10.989
What?

29:11.080 --> 29:12.957
About 1 :30 in the morning.

29:13.040 --> 29:16.032
Why would a woman come over
at 1 :30 to see you?

29:16.120 --> 29:19.112
Why do you think? 
I'll have a six-pack.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.677
Women and fish...

29:21.760 --> 29:24.354
you can never
catch either one of them, Gustafson.

29:24.440 --> 29:27.637
I've laid more pipe in this town
than Wabasha Plumbing.

29:28.040 --> 29:30.600
You're going to go after her?

29:30.760 --> 29:34.833
Oh, jeez. God no. She's too....
She's too disturbed for me.

29:34.920 --> 29:39.391
-For you maybe.
-I won't have anything to do with her.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.875
Women fall too hard for me.

29:41.960 --> 29:43.837
They get obsessed with me.

29:44.200 --> 29:47.033
It's like one of them
Fatal Attraction things...

29:47.120 --> 29:49.873
that they show on
The Donahue Show, you know.

29:49.960 --> 29:53.555
You guys
are the biggest damn bullshitters...

29:53.640 --> 29:57.030
in this entire frozen nation.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.669
You're just plain chicken...

29:59.760 --> 30:01.557
both of you, if you ask me.

30:01.760 --> 30:05.036
A beautiful woman just sitting there...

30:05.160 --> 30:07.310
20 feet from your front yards...

30:07.400 --> 30:11.473
and you're trying to tell me
you'd rather park your wrinkly butts...

30:11.560 --> 30:16.475
on a frozen piece of ice
kissing up to buckets of fish bait.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.595
Gee, listen to Casanova.

30:19.800 --> 30:22.360
Yeah, he's a regular Don Juan.

30:22.440 --> 30:25.557
No wonder the ladies "Don Juan"
anything to do with you.

30:25.640 --> 30:27.437
-That's it.
-That did it. Bye.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.431
I'm out.

30:29.640 --> 30:31.949
Hey, Max, say hello to Jake for me.

30:32.040 --> 30:34.838
Why don't you come over
and have some turkey with us?

30:34.920 --> 30:37.480
There's always plenty of bird
with just Jacob and me.

30:37.560 --> 30:40.028
That way you can spend next week
in bed with ptomaine.

30:40.120 --> 30:42.793
Come over to my place,
Melanie cooks up a feast.

30:42.920 --> 30:46.310
Thanks. But you know those old boys
at the VFW...

30:46.400 --> 30:48.436
expect me every Thanksgiving.

30:48.520 --> 30:50.511
Forget it. See you, Chuck.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.552
-Moron.
-Putz.

30:55.560 --> 30:57.039
Tell me something.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.838
-Do I stink?
-Yeah.

30:58.920 --> 31:01.673
Not you, smartass. 
Didn't ask you.

31:04.800 --> 31:07.997
I could smell it in the car.
This stink.

31:08.480 --> 31:09.595
Is it me?

31:11.520 --> 31:12.509
Yep.

31:15.560 --> 31:16.629
Damn.

31:31.240 --> 31:33.435
What the hell is that?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.672
For Christ's sake.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.959
Gustafson.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.830
You schmuck.

32:23.120 --> 32:25.839
Damn disgrace
the way they coach that team.

32:41.880 --> 32:42.995
Stay there.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.077
Stay there, you little bastard.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.832
It's the Green Hornet.

33:01.080 --> 33:04.277
-How are you, Punky?
-Hey, buttercup.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.278
Give me two packs of Camels...

33:06.440 --> 33:10.319
and a cup of your special coffee,
you love muffin.

33:10.560 --> 33:13.028
You should smoke filter cigarettes.

33:13.120 --> 33:17.511
Yeah, well, I'm 94 years old.
What the hell do I care?

33:18.480 --> 33:20.072
Thank you, dear.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.519
Max is here.

33:44.840 --> 33:46.796
Come on, love muffin.

33:52.760 --> 33:53.636
Thanks.

33:55.040 --> 33:58.191
-You were always there to save me.
-Yeah, right.

33:58.280 --> 34:00.840
When Billy Gerber locked me
in the tree house...

34:00.920 --> 34:02.512
you were my knight in shining armor.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.750
And I got a black eye for my effort.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.637
-Let me get that.
-There you go.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.516
I always knew, you know.

34:08.600 --> 34:09.715
Knew what?

34:10.239 --> 34:12.833
That you had a crush on me
since 6th grade.

34:13.040 --> 34:15.474
You watched me
with your dad's binoculars.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.516
What? No.

34:18.560 --> 34:22.109
You never wondered why my curtains
were open just enough?

34:22.360 --> 34:24.078
I thought I was lucky.

34:24.880 --> 34:27.030
I just did it to torture you.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.589
Well, you succeeded wonderfully.

34:30.840 --> 34:32.831
How come you never asked me out?

34:36.159 --> 34:37.752
Hey, Mel. Hi, Jakie.

34:37.840 --> 34:40.228
Mel, is the turkey
supposed to be smoking?

34:40.760 --> 34:43.149
I better run. 
See you.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.239
Happy Thanksgiving.

34:47.040 --> 34:49.031
-How are you?
-Good.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.156
They're getting a divorce.

34:51.360 --> 34:55.433
Mel and Mike are divorcing.
They call it a separation, but it's divorce.

34:55.639 --> 34:57.756
I'm sorry to hear that.

34:58.240 --> 35:01.312
-So, are you seeing anyone special?
-Me?

35:03.120 --> 35:06.590
-No, I guess not. Nobody serious.
-What do you know?

35:08.480 --> 35:10.471
We got a new neighbor, did you hear?

35:10.800 --> 35:13.075
Everyone in town
is talking about this woman.

35:13.880 --> 35:16.269
She hasn't been out since 1 1 :20.

35:17.160 --> 35:20.550
-What are you doing? Clocking her?
-She keeps odd hours.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.197
Very interesting woman.

35:23.280 --> 35:25.350
Sounds like a wacko to me.

35:26.880 --> 35:29.189
I haven't had sex for 15 years.

35:37.480 --> 35:39.198
Could I have some?

35:41.800 --> 35:43.119
-Oh, my....
-Too much, Dad?

35:43.200 --> 35:44.474
That was plenty.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.676
Give Jakie some leftovers to take home.

35:46.760 --> 35:48.273
He'll have his own leftovers.

35:48.360 --> 35:52.148
That pre-cooked stuff his old man gets?
That tastes like cardboard.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.830
Why don't you go and talk to her?

35:56.160 --> 35:57.479
Talk to who?

35:58.760 --> 36:01.069
You spent half the meal
staring out the window.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.149
Squirrels.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.834
The squirrels on her roof.
That's what I was staring at.

36:04.920 --> 36:09.789
You're a handsome guy with a nice house,
a good pension. You got a lot to offer.

36:09.880 --> 36:11.996
Well, I got something to offer her.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.111
I got zip to offer her.

36:18.120 --> 36:20.270
I can't tell if this is done.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.678
Do you know how many minutes
this needs to cook?

36:26.280 --> 36:27.554
Getting hungry.

36:30.880 --> 36:33.792
Sure be nice to have some turkey
right about now.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.875
Remember the turkey
your mother used to make?

36:37.960 --> 36:41.350
-Oh, yeah.
-Damn, she was a good cook.

36:41.720 --> 36:44.871
-You remember the stuffing?
-The best.

36:45.040 --> 36:47.838
How about those potato latkes?

36:49.680 --> 36:51.796
I thought you said
Chuck was going to VFW.

36:51.880 --> 36:54.030
-He is.
-I don't think so.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.872
What are you talking about?

36:56.200 --> 36:57.952
Looks like he's making a house call.

36:58.040 --> 36:59.189
What?

37:01.200 --> 37:02.269
What in the....

37:02.360 --> 37:04.078
Hell is he doing there?

37:06.720 --> 37:09.075
-He's going to do it.
-So?

37:09.160 --> 37:10.479
What?

37:10.760 --> 37:13.149
What is he doing in that crazy....

37:13.240 --> 37:15.913
-Son of a....
-Jealous?

37:22.240 --> 37:24.151
He's in.

37:26.360 --> 37:29.830
Looks like Chuck's taking old one-eye
to the optometrist.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.911
Oh, Jeez, Dad. 
What?

38:03.760 --> 38:05.876
Chuck, where are you?

38:06.640 --> 38:08.312
Hello, fellas.

38:09.880 --> 38:12.269
-Some game last night.
-Double overtime.

38:12.400 --> 38:15.870
-Blackhawks were killers, weren't they?
-Did you catch the game?

38:17.520 --> 38:18.509
No.

38:19.400 --> 38:22.278
Sure, you were with the guys at the VFW.

38:22.960 --> 38:27.033
How was the turkey at the VFW
this year, Chucky?

38:28.480 --> 38:30.471
The turkey this year...

38:30.840 --> 38:32.478
was delicious.

38:34.920 --> 38:36.751
-Come on.
-We saw you.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.831
-You were there half the night.
-What'd you do?

38:38.920 --> 38:41.070
-What's it like in there?
-What'd she say?

38:41.160 --> 38:42.559
Fellas.

38:42.880 --> 38:45.348
Some experiences in life are too rich...

38:45.440 --> 38:48.637
and too beautiful to put into words.

38:49.040 --> 38:51.031
What does that mean exactly?

38:51.120 --> 38:55.511
Could have been either of you
if you just had the guts to ask.

38:57.160 --> 39:01.119
-You and she?
-I'm not talking about sex, dummies.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.918
-No?
-Of course not.

39:05.440 --> 39:06.873
I get it.

39:07.760 --> 39:10.228
Your old pal failed you, Chuck?

39:10.560 --> 39:12.994
Couldn't rise to the occasion?

39:13.360 --> 39:17.148
-Yes, the spirit was willing....
-But the flesh was....

39:17.240 --> 39:18.434
Weak.

39:19.720 --> 39:21.790
Okay, if it wasn't sex what was it?

39:25.040 --> 39:26.917
It was an awakening.

39:28.680 --> 39:31.558
Ariel reminded me that I was alive.

39:31.640 --> 39:36.111
That I was a man full of energy,
love, and passion.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.794
It was like being young again.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.990
If only for a moment.

39:45.320 --> 39:47.311
Couldn't get it up, huh?

39:49.280 --> 39:51.475
Get out of here, both of you.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.239
Yeah, I'll see you.

39:59.680 --> 40:02.114
-So long.
-Hey, boys.

40:03.680 --> 40:06.877
That's not just a woman
living across your street.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.231
She's an angel.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.510
Angel, right. 
Take it easy.

40:15.120 --> 40:16.439
See you.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.113
Holy moly.

41:33.680 --> 41:37.355
Look at all the crap you....
Excuse me. The stuff you got here.

41:37.440 --> 41:40.910
-Well, it's my inspiration.
-You're an artist?

41:41.800 --> 41:43.028
I try.

41:43.480 --> 41:47.473
I used to teach courses
in Expressionism at Berkeley.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.672
But now I'm back to
the classics of literature.

41:51.040 --> 41:52.996
Berkeley, that explains it.

41:53.440 --> 41:54.714
Oh, my God.

41:55.360 --> 41:56.475
What?

41:57.160 --> 41:59.151
Your TV. 
It's got no guts.

41:59.480 --> 42:00.754
I took them out.

42:00.840 --> 42:04.230
How could you do that
to a '54 Super Zenith?

42:04.600 --> 42:06.591
This TV is a classic.

42:06.760 --> 42:09.638
I can fix it for you if you wanted me to.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.593
That's what I used to do.
I was a TV repairman.

42:12.680 --> 42:15.478
That's so sweet, Max, but...

42:15.760 --> 42:18.194
I think it works quite well...

42:18.320 --> 42:19.992
just the way it is.

42:21.960 --> 42:24.474
How the hell does she see any shows?

42:31.160 --> 42:32.559
Holy moly.

42:37.720 --> 42:38.948
I see you've met Ernest.

42:39.480 --> 42:41.994
-Who?
-The model was my husband.

42:42.880 --> 42:45.872
He sure wasn't pleased about
modeling in the nude.

42:46.040 --> 42:48.713
Took quite a bit of prompting, I must say.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.274
He's....

42:51.880 --> 42:53.199
Passed on.

42:53.480 --> 42:55.072
Five years ago.

42:57.560 --> 42:59.312
Would you like some coffee?

43:00.080 --> 43:01.559
Cream and sugar?

43:15.200 --> 43:17.998
Sure moved around a lot
the last few years, didn't you?

43:18.320 --> 43:22.552
Yes, I think it's exciting
to experience new things...

43:22.640 --> 43:25.552
new places, and meet new people.

43:25.640 --> 43:26.868
Like you.

43:30.800 --> 43:31.994
Do you paint?

43:32.520 --> 43:35.353
Paint? Me? 
Sure do.

43:35.720 --> 43:38.109
I paint the shed every spring.

43:38.760 --> 43:40.751
-You get it?
-I get it.

43:41.840 --> 43:43.353
I mean, you know...

43:43.640 --> 43:45.119
pictures, paintings.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.239
What for?

43:47.960 --> 43:50.758
Everyone needs some form of...

43:51.640 --> 43:52.834
release.

43:54.080 --> 43:55.354
I fish.

43:56.360 --> 43:57.349
Fish?

44:01.480 --> 44:04.870
Yeah, fish. 
I can see the beauty in that.

44:05.280 --> 44:06.269
Yeah?

44:10.040 --> 44:11.712
Miss Truax...

44:12.240 --> 44:16.233
would you honor me by accompanying me
to my ice shanty tomorrow?

44:19.520 --> 44:21.431
I'd be honored.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.878
-See you tomorrow.
-Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

44:34.600 --> 44:36.079
Be careful.

44:37.200 --> 44:40.795
We're having a heat wave
A tropical heat wave

44:40.880 --> 44:43.269
We're having a heat wave

44:46.440 --> 44:48.715
-I can't hold it.
-Reel him in.

44:48.800 --> 44:50.916
-I can't hold him, Max.
-Work him.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.913
-I am trying. I can't hold it.
-Reel it in.

44:55.960 --> 44:58.349
-I'm trying but I can't.
-Okay, give me the pole.

44:58.440 --> 45:00.829
Hold on. Not on your life.

45:01.360 --> 45:05.956
Pull it. You got to pull it.
No, don't pull too hard. That's it.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.399
Morning, John.

45:13.120 --> 45:14.838
Morning, Punky.

45:17.320 --> 45:20.915
-I almost lost him.
-Max, he's just magnificent.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.276
He's a record breaker.
You've got a 3-footer.

45:25.880 --> 45:28.075
I can see the beauty in this now.

45:28.160 --> 45:31.357
-Can you see it?
-Yes, the lure. No, the fight.

45:31.600 --> 45:33.636
-Wait till I show the guys.
-The catch.

45:33.720 --> 45:36.029
-What a catch.
-And then the release.

45:37.160 --> 45:40.550
-What? There's no release.
-Yes, it's beautiful.

45:40.640 --> 45:44.235
No, what's beautiful is this monster
on my wall stuffed.

45:45.280 --> 45:48.192
There can be no stuffing.
This is a live creature.

45:48.400 --> 45:50.675
Full of courage and life.

45:50.960 --> 45:54.111
Nobody will believe me.
Let me get a camera.

45:54.600 --> 45:57.637
-I hear the water calling it back.
-Where is it?

45:57.720 --> 45:59.358
-Here we go.
-Wait.

45:59.440 --> 46:02.079
-Calling.
-Here. Hold it.

46:13.080 --> 46:14.069
Hey, Pop.

46:19.520 --> 46:22.114
Hey. Just finishing breakfast.

46:22.320 --> 46:23.799
So I see.

46:24.560 --> 46:27.358
Colder than a witch's titty out there.

46:28.560 --> 46:30.278
Where did you get this fishing pole?

46:30.360 --> 46:33.033
I snagged it about an hour ago.

46:33.440 --> 46:35.715
The only damn thing I caught all day.

46:41.080 --> 46:43.514
Chuck, guess what Pop found.

46:56.080 --> 46:58.674
You forgot to unlock
the back door, you dummy.

47:15.920 --> 47:19.230
Isn't it wonderful to have
a little adventure every day?

47:19.400 --> 47:21.960
You're one hell of a fisherman, Ariel.

47:22.040 --> 47:23.871
I learned from the best.

47:24.280 --> 47:26.669
Hope you weren't mad at me
for putting them back.

47:26.760 --> 47:29.672
That's okay.
Gustafson does the same thing.

47:29.840 --> 47:33.515
He just keeps the ones he eats.
That's what he says.

47:33.640 --> 47:35.631
I think he never catches them.

47:37.720 --> 47:40.109
I think we're going to be great friends.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.072
Friends is good. 
That's good, isn't it?

47:47.320 --> 47:50.153
How about some supper tonight?
After your class, I mean.

47:50.240 --> 47:54.518
Thank you so much, but I already
have made plans. I'm sorry.

47:55.600 --> 47:58.068
-I'll take a rain check.
-That's a deal.

47:59.720 --> 48:02.598
Until we meet again, my dear Ariel.

48:03.960 --> 48:05.029
Goodbye.

48:06.560 --> 48:08.391
Watch out. 
Don't slip.

48:19.560 --> 48:22.757
Well, Gustafson,
looks like the best man won.

48:26.040 --> 48:28.315
You always were a lousy loser.

48:30.160 --> 48:31.388
He's dead.

48:32.440 --> 48:34.749
-What? Who?
-Chuck.

48:35.800 --> 48:37.199
Chuck? How?

48:38.200 --> 48:40.191
Last night in his sleep.

48:40.560 --> 48:41.913
In his sleep.

48:43.440 --> 48:44.953
Lucky bastard.

48:45.200 --> 48:48.556
You might have known
if you hadn't been out with that minx.

48:48.640 --> 48:51.712
Hey, it ain't my fault.
Chuck was my friend, too.

48:52.120 --> 48:54.350
You call yourself a friend, 
you bastard.

48:54.440 --> 48:57.034
Watch your mouth, you dumb Swede.

48:57.120 --> 48:59.236
Don't tell me what to do.

48:59.800 --> 49:01.552
Big man with the axe in your hand.

49:01.640 --> 49:04.791
Axe? You want to clock me?
You think you can take me? Come on.

49:04.920 --> 49:07.992
All right. 1937, at Todd Field...

49:08.080 --> 49:12.949
I kicked your ass after football practice
when you stole my liniment.

49:13.040 --> 49:16.112
-I kicked your ass and I can do it again.
-Bullshit.

49:16.200 --> 49:18.191
Give it your best shot, shrimp.

49:21.320 --> 49:22.719
It's not worth it.

49:24.120 --> 49:26.395
Get out of there.

49:33.960 --> 49:35.075
Damn.

49:36.200 --> 49:39.476
He has the intelligence 
quotient of a newt.

49:53.040 --> 49:55.634
Shrimp thinks he can get funny 
with me.

49:57.040 --> 49:58.473
Left hook...

49:58.640 --> 50:00.312
right cross...

50:00.400 --> 50:01.913
and dump him.

50:12.560 --> 50:14.118
I'm going to kill him.

50:15.120 --> 50:17.315
God damn you, Goldman, you....

50:20.040 --> 50:22.713
I'm Elliot Snyder
of the lnternal Revenue Service.

50:22.800 --> 50:25.189
I'm asking you
to accompany me to my office.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.596
I was wondering where you were.

51:52.400 --> 51:55.198
I had a little business.

51:55.360 --> 51:57.351
I hope it went all right.

51:59.800 --> 52:02.075
-What are you doing?
-Cooking.

52:08.360 --> 52:10.749
Wait, I can't have anything spicy.

52:10.840 --> 52:13.115
If it's too exciting, 
I'm up all night.

52:13.440 --> 52:16.034
Good. 
I'm making Szechwan.

52:22.040 --> 52:26.397
From the moment I saw you, I could feel
that we had the same kind of aura.

52:26.480 --> 52:29.517
-That we share something special.
-Teaching.

52:29.800 --> 52:32.872
39 years I taught American History
at Wabasha High.

52:33.480 --> 52:35.471
History, it's so romantic.

52:36.520 --> 52:39.080
Great dental plan.

52:42.800 --> 52:45.155
The ideas you brought to
those young minds.

52:45.240 --> 52:47.754
Kids think they know it all, right?

52:48.080 --> 52:51.117
Once in a while you reach one.
You touch them somehow.

52:51.200 --> 52:53.156
-I did that once.
-Really?

52:53.240 --> 52:55.071
It was my RooseveIt's New Deal lecture.

52:55.160 --> 52:58.357
I touched a kid on the back of his head
while he was snoring.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.279
You're so bad.

53:03.440 --> 53:04.839
You know...

53:06.640 --> 53:08.915
Chuck, he....

53:11.960 --> 53:13.075
I know.

53:14.760 --> 53:18.753
We can be thankful that
we had the privilege of knowing him...

53:18.840 --> 53:20.512
while he was here.

53:28.160 --> 53:29.434
To Chuck.

53:30.960 --> 53:32.552
Yes, to Chuck.

53:42.760 --> 53:45.479
Thank you, John.
It was a wonderful evening.

53:45.560 --> 53:47.073
Thank you, Ariel.

54:04.440 --> 54:07.352
Pop, you think I should I call her?

54:07.440 --> 54:08.953
-What?
-The woman.

54:09.200 --> 54:12.272
Well, let me tell you something, John.

54:12.480 --> 54:15.074
The first 90 years or so...

54:15.240 --> 54:17.276
they go by pretty fast.

54:18.280 --> 54:21.477
-What?
-The first 90 years go by fast.

54:21.560 --> 54:24.677
How would you know?
You're just a damn kid.

54:24.760 --> 54:26.591
I didn't say it, you did.

54:26.720 --> 54:29.393
Well, they do. They go fast.

54:29.480 --> 54:31.471
Then one day you wake up...

54:31.560 --> 54:33.152
and you realize...

54:33.280 --> 54:36.238
that you're not 81 anymore.

54:36.360 --> 54:39.193
You begin to count the minutes
rather than the days...

54:39.280 --> 54:42.989
and you realize
that pretty soon you'll be gone.

54:43.080 --> 54:46.390
And that all you have, see,
is the experiences.

54:46.480 --> 54:50.109
That's all there is.
Everything. The experiences.

54:55.600 --> 54:57.556
You mount the woman, son.

54:59.360 --> 55:00.793
Or else...

55:01.040 --> 55:03.156
send her out to me.

55:43.080 --> 55:47.198
I happened to come by these two tickets
for the Gopher game.

55:50.160 --> 55:52.549
Ever play much ice hockey?

55:59.000 --> 56:00.991
We had an appointment.

56:09.800 --> 56:12.394
There she is. Wabasha.

56:15.720 --> 56:17.711
It is just beautiful.

56:17.800 --> 56:21.839
Yeah, from up here. I used to camp
up here when I was a kid.

56:25.440 --> 56:26.998
What are you thinking?

56:27.320 --> 56:28.753
I'm sorry.

56:29.760 --> 56:31.034
It's the snow...

56:32.760 --> 56:35.752
reminded me of the last Christmas
I spent with my husband.

56:41.080 --> 56:44.152
-Are you all right?
-Yes, an angel.

56:44.240 --> 56:47.277
-What?
-I'm making a snow angel, remember?

56:48.720 --> 56:49.914
I remember.

57:03.680 --> 57:05.398
Do you believe in angels?

57:07.880 --> 57:09.598
They're all around us.

57:10.680 --> 57:13.638
You've got to look hard 
but they're there...

57:14.880 --> 57:17.519
whenever anything good happens to us.

57:19.040 --> 57:20.632
I think I see one.

57:38.200 --> 57:40.873
Look at how large Papa 's 
bald spot is.

57:41.280 --> 57:43.999
Actually does look like 
hair growing there.

57:44.160 --> 57:48.278
...you could imagine problems
that will become reality.

58:08.200 --> 58:12.034
Give it all you've got.
Again and again and again.

58:16.880 --> 58:18.996
I'll have you mated in three moves.

58:19.160 --> 58:22.835
Shouldn't we get to know each other
a little better first?

58:25.840 --> 58:29.230
You have a wonderful smile.
You should wear it more often.

58:31.120 --> 58:33.680
I bring it out on special occasions.

58:36.680 --> 58:38.113
Tell me, who's this?

58:38.480 --> 58:39.959
-What?
-Over here.

58:40.160 --> 58:42.230
That's my dad. That's Pop.

58:42.640 --> 58:45.438
This handsome guy, you know him, right?

58:45.520 --> 58:48.796
My daughter Melanie and her mother,
and Melanie and her husband, Mike.

58:48.880 --> 58:50.154
She's beautiful.

58:50.280 --> 58:52.271
Who are these people here?

58:52.360 --> 58:55.477
That little girl is Alexandra,
my granddaughter.

58:56.480 --> 58:58.835
-My son, Brian.
-He's so handsome.

58:59.440 --> 59:00.919
Lost him in Vietnam.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.753
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay. It's all right.

59:05.200 --> 59:06.599
These little guys.

59:07.320 --> 59:08.958
That's me and the moron.

59:09.560 --> 59:12.154
Of course it's Max. 
He's ugly isn't he?

59:12.320 --> 59:16.108
-You mean you were friends?
-I was 10 and didn't know any better.

59:17.480 --> 59:20.836
What can make two grown men
spend most of their lives fighting?

59:20.920 --> 59:23.354
-Guess.
-A woman.

59:24.200 --> 59:25.474
How romantic.

59:26.120 --> 59:28.634
No, it wasn't romantic at all.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.195
What did I know, I was just a kid.

59:33.760 --> 59:35.716
Which I am not anymore.

59:49.760 --> 59:51.751
I think it's kind of late.

59:53.240 --> 59:56.232
Oh, yeah. I guess....

59:56.320 --> 59:57.912
It's time for bed.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.319
God, you are dumb, dumb, dumb.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.756
Ariel, I'm sorry that....

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.951
I thought you said....

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.191
I said it's time for bed.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.800
Well, wait, what about....

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.871
-What?
-Well, you've been seeing....

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:26.949
Max?

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.078
He's just my friend.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.109
The last man I slept 
with was my husband.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.358
Wait a minute.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.078
I'm not prepared.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.355
These days, they say
you have to do safe sex.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.115
When was the last time 
you made love?

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.396
October 4...

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.159
1978.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.876
I think we're safe.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.674
Good morning.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.119
Are those for me?

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.438
They're just beautiful. 
Thank you.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.474
They're for you. 
I got them for you.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.068
Thank you. 
How sweet.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.152
Got them for you.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.998
Snake in the grass.

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.750
Burn, baby, burn.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.229
Creep.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:34.955
Holy shit. Max. 
Stop the car, you idiot.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.273
Look out, Goldman's gone nuts.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.557
-Max, you've really lost it.
-Dirty little bastard.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.312
Are you out of your mind?

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.191
He belongs in a rubber room.

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:25.109
I fixed your fishing pole.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.755
Who cares about 
a damn fishing pole?

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.558
You can shove that pole.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.235
You think a lousy old pole
is going to replace her?

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.039
Are you crazy?

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:42.870
Don't egg him on. Go back 
to your fishing and leave him alone.

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.951
We'll settle this thing.

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.195
Cut it out.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.995
Shrimp, you're not going anywhere.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.154
Come on.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.879
-You broke my nose.
-I didn't break your damn nose.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.759
Look at that.
What the hell has gotten into you?

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.910
-You stole her, didn't you?
-What?

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.228
She's mine.

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.279
-Says who?
-Says me.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.952
She came to me.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.154
You're stealing her 
away just like May.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:29.073
Could I remind you, Einstein,
May was no prize.

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.229
She was to me.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.118
I was married to her for 20 years.
She was no prize.

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:36.078
-She was to me.
-That's why you are a moron.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:39.596
If you'd stayed with May you wouldn't
have had Amy, who was a good woman.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:42.399
-She was the best.
-And more loyal than May ever was.

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.595
-Absolutely.
-So.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.119
So what?

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.473
Well, did you?

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.029
What?

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:03.634
You know.

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:07.550
-That's a private matter.
-Private, my foot. Did you?

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.517
-...all I can tell you.
-You better tell me.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.194
Okay, we danced the horizontal mambo.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:15.636
It was the greatest sex I ever had
in my life. Are you happy?

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.075
Drop that fish.

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.795
Don't make me
have to separate you two again.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.310
Go to your shanties, all of you.

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.710
You're scaring the fish away.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.389
Damn kids.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.197
Kids. You can't live with them,
can't shoot them.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.312
How you going to take care
of her, Gustafson?

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:02.919
How are you going to support her
when the lRS takes your house away?

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:10.549
I can't wait around for another Amy.
I ain't got time.

01:09:01.479 --> 01:09:03.357
This time you win.

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:32.238
If you're not going to keep
our date tonight, I'll bring the date to you.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:36.390
You promised to come over
and give me the New Deal lecture...

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:38.755
-and like a good student--
-What's that?

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.868
A gift.

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.438
A snow angel.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.352
You inspired it.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.559
I can't accept it.

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:54.959
Why not?

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.076
It might be a very good idea
if we didn't see each other.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:09.070
For a while. Give each of us
a chance to be alone and....

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.952
But I thought....

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:16.319
God damn it. In the first place
I'm too old for you. Okay?

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:20.278
I don't like you coming over here
any time you feel like it.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.352
I don't like you hanging around here
all day long.

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.873
I'm not like you. 
I'm not afraid to be alone.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.151
I am not afraid to be alone.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.278
I just prefer 
to experience things...

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:35.909
and not watch them on television
or out the windows like you do.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.389
Don't you understand? 
I like being alone.

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.277
I understand.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.153
I understand completely.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:45.471
-You don't know a damn thing about me.
-I do, too.

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:50.749
I know the only things in life that
you regret are the risks you don't take.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:54.793
But you wouldn't understand that.
Because you're too pig-headed.

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:41.349
Damn.

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.551
How are you doing?

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:52.313
-Merry Christmas.
-Congratulations on the election.

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.994
That's old news. 
Where have you been?

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:59.272
I had all this stuff
that I had to get taken care of.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:02.435
Melanie said
she's going to come by tonight.

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.988
-You, know, Christmas Eve. Around 9:00.
-ls that right?

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.356
-Why don't you drop over later?
-I'll do that.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:27.592
This neighborhood will be a lot safer
without that snowmobile around.

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.875
Hi, Jacob. Hello, putz.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.112
Merry Christmas, John.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.234
Your cat crapped on my steps again.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.749
Who says you can't train a cat?

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:47.833
It's a warning. If it happens again
I'll punch you in the nose.

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.712
He started it.

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:11.319
Where's Santa's favorite little girl?

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.879
Merry Christmas, Dad.

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.189
Hi, John.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.757
What, no twinkle lights?

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:24.797
I forgot about them this year.

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.079
Be polite.

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.031
Merry Christmas.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.558
Can I put Allie in your bed?

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.710
-Sure.
-Good night, baby.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.031
Bedtime. Say good night to Grandpa.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.672
How've you been?

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:49.559
Lousy. Thought you two
were getting a divorce.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:54.109
Actually, it's only a separation.

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:58.628
I had to work some things out for myself
before we could work on us.

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.117
Did you get it worked out?

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.752
As far as I can tell.

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.752
That's great, Mike.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.719
Maybe the rest of us
should put our lives on hold...

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:18.792
for the next two weeks
while you fill up with enough booze...

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:21.394
to make up your mind.

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.799
You know...

01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.198
I think I'll grab a beer.

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:33.589
Grab a beer. 
It's in the fridge.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.594
-What had gotten into you?
-I don't know.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:40.318
Grab me one, too.

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.675
Dad, try and understand...

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:45.558
he says he's all straightened out.

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:50.236
What do I know? I'm 68 years old.
I got no house, no wife, no pension.

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:51.588
What are you saying?

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:54.672
I don't know one damn thing,
but I know this.

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:59.436
The only things in this life that you regret
are the risks you didn't take.

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.511
If you see a chance to be happy...

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:05.354
grab it with both hands and
to hell with the consequences.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:15.318
I'll be damned if I can find a bottle opener.

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:21.717
Sweetheart, I'm going to walk down
to Slippery's.

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.274
What?

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:33.149
Hey, Jakie. 
Merry Christmas.

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.559
Merry Christmas.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.639
Is this a bad time?

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.199
I'm sorry.

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.997
I don't know what's wrong with him.
He just exploded.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.877
You want me to go after him?

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:48.350
He'll cool off down at Slippery's.
Come on in.

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:51.989
What's that?

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.590
This is broccoli.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.438
Pop didn't have mistletoe.

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:05.990
Mike. Hey! You're next, big guy.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.229
Hi, Stinky.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:12.598
I just came by
to wish you all a Merry Christmas.

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:15.592
That was sweet, Jacob.
Wasn't that sweet, Mike?

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.356
Sweet and short.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:27.032
Good to see you, Mike.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.120
-Could I ask you a favor?
-Sure.

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:38.757
Could you have a word with your dad?
See if they can't make up for Christmas.

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.277
Sure. Absolutely.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.392
That would be great.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.795
Merry Christmas.

01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.671
Over to Gustafson's?

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.752
Melanie there?

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.755
She look good?

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.551
Very. She also looks
to still be married.

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.392
What? Mike's back?

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.159
Looks that way.

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:21.949
Melanie said that
John just exploded and walked out.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.873
-So?
-So what's going on?

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:28.838
Nothing that shouldn't
have happened years ago.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:38.031
He tried to steal her away from me,
but I won.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.230
Could you at least talk to him?

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:47.477
My door is open.
He knows where to find me.

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:50.719
He started it.

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:54.957
I don't care who started it,
you're going to end it.

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.275
I don't like him. 
I never liked him.

01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.316
It's Christmas, Pop.

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:03.555
You could go down to Slippery's
and make peace with the man.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.514
I'd rather kiss a dead moose's butt.

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:14.273
This 1,500-pound moose
is the real thing, folks.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:18.439
Reared by local volunteer firefighter,
Peter Carlson, of Wabasha.

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:21.353
He found it injured while hunting,
brought it home...

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.158
and raised it in his home.

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.519
Merry Christmas.

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:44.594
Moron.

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.194
Putz.

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.314
Thank you.

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:54.799
Jacob says Mike and Melanie
are getting back together.

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.430
He doesn't know his ass
from a hole in the ground.

01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.397
Melanie is getting a divorce.

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.878
I got a couple of things 
I want to tell you.

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:10.512
The reason 
I came down here tonight is...

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.159
I wanted to tell you--

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.037
Spit it out. 
I haven't got all night.

01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.599
-Don't shout.
-I'm not.

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:19.719
Bust my tucchus to come here
on Christmas Eve to thank you...

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.796
and all you do is shout at me.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.472
To thank me?

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.793
All right, I take it back. 
I don't thank you.

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:29.631
Jesus, it's impossible.

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.199
Look, Goldman...

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.991
I want to ask you something.

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:47.069
Well, what? I ain't got all night, either.
I'm just as busy as you are.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.513
Do you love her?

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:52.638
Do I love her?
What does that have to do with anything?

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:55.075
It would make
the whole thing worthwhile.

01:19:55.160 --> 01:20:00.075
You know something, I think you've
lost whatever marbles you ever had.

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:03.272
Do you think you walked 
on coals for me?

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:06.716
Gave me back my old fishing pole
and I said "thank you."

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.119
Fishing pole?

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:12.869
Pisses me off you broke it,
but schmuck that you are...

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.276
I got to be realistic. 
What's so funny?

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:19.875
You are so blind, you think
this is about a stupid fishing pole?

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.393
-What's it about?
-Forget it.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.835
What do you mean forget it?
Don't give me that crap.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.148
I want to know.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.958
-You really want to know?
-Yes.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.428
What about her?

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.275
You made me feel sorry for you.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.157
She chose me.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.799
She did.

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:50.032
And if anyone says otherwise
they're damn liars.

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.879
What's the difference?
You got her anyway.

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:01.316
What the hell are you looking at?

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.119
Stupid moron.

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:17.957
What an idiot.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:46.275
It makes a difference, damn it.

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:12.191
Dirty rat. Little turd.

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:21.839
Oh, my God.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.554
Are you dead?

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:35.150
Not yet. But I don't want to die
looking at your ugly face.

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.755
Stay there. Stay right there.

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:41.114
Wait a minute. 
I'll be right back.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:50.117
Help. 
It's an emergency.

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:54.075
Emergency. We need an ambulance.
Somebody dial 91 1.

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:01.231
Could you tell me....

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.111
Nurse.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.960
Nurse, could you tell me
where Mr. John Gustafson is?

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:11.712
Are you friend or family?

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.275
What?

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:17.270
Are you friend or family, sir?

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.869
Friend.

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.956
Merry Christmas, John.

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:08.999
You putz.

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:28.672
Well, you'd better have a good reason
for standing me up this morning.

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:33.959
What's wrong?

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.639
Can I come in?

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.069
Sure.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.279
I know you wanted to get rid of me,
but isn't this a little drastic?

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:09.074
My husband passed away at Easter.

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:14.315
If you leave me at Christmas, I won't
have any holidays to look forward to.

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:17.235
Except maybe Thanksgiving and....

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.310
I'm not crazy about turkey.

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:25.312
So, what do you say?

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:27.994
Let's get out of here.

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:29.919
All right.

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.358
Okay, I can wait.

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.956
The guy could be dead tomorrow.

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.554
I'm sorry your friend is sick...

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.950
but the court order is in
and my hands are tied.

01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.429
Check the bedroom. 
File the paperwork.

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:03.872
He's straight as a grizzly's dick.
He'd never cheat on his taxes.

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.991
It's not a matter of cheating.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:08.355
It's a matter of miscalculation.

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:13.355
He got health benefits for 20 years
while claiming as a married man.

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:17.074
However, he omitted to inform us that...

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:20.072
his ex-wife had a part-time job
for 1 1 of those 20 years.

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:22.549
Had he done so, 
we'd have informed him...

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:24.875
that, because of her income...

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:29.556
a larger portion of those benefits
were subject to federal tax.

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:31.597
About $13,000.

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.557
He can raise that.

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:35.915
However...

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:39.318
that amount, when combined with...

01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:44.555
1 1 years worth of interest,
mandatory late charges, and penalties...

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.589
comes out at about $57,000, ballpark.

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.991
He'd never find that.

01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:58.714
He will when we sell his house.

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:14.073
Dirty rat. I'll show him. 
Picking on people.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.116
Let's go.

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:22.555
-Where's the realtor?
-Get the door?

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:26.198
The furniture goes 
to the auction house.

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:30.199
Any paperwork
put in the back of my car, okay?

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.197
Beautiful day.

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:38.552
Do the world a favor and pull your lip
over your head and swallow.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.068
Asshole.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.479
Bloodsuckers.

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:50.397
Max, what's going on?

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.469
Morning, Ariel!

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.713
Anyone looking?

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.549
No, why?

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:03.759
We got a problem.

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:06.958
-What is it?
-Somebody's barricaded the doors.

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.114
Wait a minute.

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:10.669
What?

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:14.633
-Break it in.
-Watch this. You'll get a kick out of it.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.718
We'll see about this.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:25.632
This isn't going to stop me, Mr. Goldman.

01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:28.670
I got him right where I want him.

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:41.952
Got it, just like you said.

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.038
-You don't understand.
-I can handle it.

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:48.548
I'm Jacob Goldman, Mayor of Wabasha.

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:55.519
I have a 30-day cease and desist order.
You can't touch this house.

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.514
Very well.

01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:58.918
-You look great.
-Thanks, so do you.

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:04.349
I mean it. People always try to be nice
by saying you look great but...

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.158
you really do look great.

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:09.118
-I feel good.
-How are you?

01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:11.037
I'm good, Jacob.

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.759
Listen, I'm sorry about the....

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:17.871
Divorce. Thanks.

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:21.438
I'm just glad it's over and done with.

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:23.558
You must be.

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:29.154
-Ready for this?
-No, not really.

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:35.437
Listen, if you need someone
to talk to tonight...

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.192
I'm staying at Pop's.

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:41.438
Thanks, Jacob. 
I'd like that.

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:45.555
Hey, you two. 
Get your asses in here.

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:49.798
I guess it's time.

01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:59.917
-Where have you been?
-Relax. You nervous?

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.672
The groom is nervous.

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:04.679
-I'm not nervous, schmuck.
-Don't call me schmuck, putz.

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.352
You're in a church.

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.789
Wait.

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:49.350
Ain't you forgetting something?

01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:54.834
That'll do it.

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:58.112
That'll do it, Dad. 
I think that'll do it.

01:31:58.200 --> 01:31:59.553
Okay, here we go.

01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:05.235
-You're the greatest.
-Thank you.

01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:10.751
-I love you.
-Goodbye, pumpkin.

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:12.749
Have fun.

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:14.835
Here's your house.

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:17.275
Jacob got them to waive
the penalties and interest.

01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:18.952
I took care of the $13,000.

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:22.592
Wipe the smile off your face,
it's just a loan.

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:29.390
I'll lay eight-to-five you can't get it up
the entire honeymoon.

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:31.114
You're on.

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:33.152
I got a sure winner.

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:52.559
You smell something?

01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:55.271
What is that?

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.195
That dirty son of a....

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:12.952
What a putz.

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:21.993
What do you feel like tonight,
Leno or Letterman?

01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.674
Tell me about it in the morning.

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:26.319
Where are you going?

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:31.269
The Daughters of the American Revolution
are having a dance at the VFW.

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:34.711
Maybe I'll get lucky. Don't wait up for me.

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:40.600
-What have you got there?
-Broccoli.

01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:42.272
Holy moly.

01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:51.671
He's in.

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:56.150
Looks like he's going to enter
the holy of holies.

01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:58.151
Coitus uninterruptus.

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:02.798
I throw back what 
I'm not going to eat.

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:06.714
Yeah, like that 40-pound muskie
you're always yakking about.

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:08.279
It's a shame that...

01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:13.678
your uncle has a fish market
on 23rd Street and 14th Avenue.

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:14.875
26th.

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:16.712
26th Street, you dummy.

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.154
You schmuck.

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:23.916
Yeah. It looks like Chuck's
slipping her the old salami.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.797
Oh, Jesus, Dad.

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:34.873
I'm Ronald Reagan. I used to be
President of the United States.

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:37.508
-I live across the street.
-Yes, come in.

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:41.309
I was also in the movies.
I was a lousy actor.

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:47.473
Looks like Chuck's going to
put the hot dog in the bun.

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.477
Oh, Jesus, Dad.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.956
That's why I came down.

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:54.598
Spit it out.

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.477
-Don't shout.
-I'm not.

01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:59.154
Bust my tucchus to get here
on New Year's Eve...

01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:01.959
or Christmas, or whatever the....

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:08.429
Looks like Chuck's a tomcat on the prowl.

01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:14.309
I got a pinched sciatica that makes
your lumbago look like eye strain.

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:18.951
Is it? Does he? Would he? Is he....

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:20.632
Yes, he is.

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:25.229
Looks like Chuck is taking
the old log to the beaver.

01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:28.839
Looks like Chuck's going to bury his boner.

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.831
That's right, you're a moron.

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:32.799
If you hadn't had Amy....

01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:47.636
It looks like Chuck is taking
the skinboat to tuna town.

01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:53.076
Looks like Chuck is taking a ride
on the wild baloney pony.

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.513
Who left?

01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:01.188
If I knew there was a nude scene
in this picture...

01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:03.236
I'd have asked for another million.

01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:04.309
Slate it.

01:39:05.305 --> 01:39:11.170
