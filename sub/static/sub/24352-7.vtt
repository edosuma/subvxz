- So, tonight,

02:47.199 --> 02:48.629
I'm going to teach you
how to steal money.

02:48.629 --> 02:50.469
Specifically, from those two.
Are you on board?

02:50.469 --> 02:52.170
- Sure.
- Dope.

02:52.170 --> 02:54.199
We're going to do that
by playing a little game.

02:54.199 --> 02:55.930
Have you ever played
Three-card Monte before?

02:55.930 --> 02:57.370
- Uh, no.

02:57.370 --> 02:58.699
- It's a brilliant game,
tremendous.

02:58.699 --> 03:00.830
You're going to love it.
It uses two black sevens.

03:00.830 --> 03:03.330
- Mm-hmm.
- And a red queen.

03:03.330 --> 03:04.669
- Okay.

03:04.669 --> 03:06.800
- The idea is that the cards
go face down,

03:06.800 --> 03:09.270
then they get mixed up,
and then people bet money

03:09.270 --> 03:11.669
to figure out if they can see
which one is the queen.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.300
Actually, were you following?
- Yes.

03:13.300 --> 03:14.599
- Which one is the queen?
- The middle one.

03:14.599 --> 03:16.199
- The middle one.

03:16.199 --> 03:17.500
- Ha.
- That was an excellent guess.

03:17.500 --> 03:18.770
You're a natural.
- Well, you were slow.

03:18.770 --> 03:19.829
So thanks.

03:19.829 --> 03:21.129
[laughter]

03:21.129 --> 03:22.270
- So the trouble
with this "game"

03:22.270 --> 03:23.500
is that I keep
saying it in quotes,

03:23.500 --> 03:25.400
because it's actually
more of a scam or a con.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.099
Like an M. Night
Shyamalan movie.

03:27.099 --> 03:29.000
[laughter]

03:29.000 --> 03:30.969
Magicians have studied
this game for years,

03:30.969 --> 03:32.629
so they understand all
of the little fiddly bits

03:32.629 --> 03:35.569
that transform it from a simple
game into a crime.

03:35.569 --> 03:37.829
So if you wanted to use this
to rip off magicians

03:37.829 --> 03:39.969
like Penn and Teller, you would
play Three-card Monte,

03:39.969 --> 03:41.329
but you would play it...

- All right.

03:54.599 --> 03:56.129
You got a red queen.
- Mm.

03:56.129 --> 03:58.129
- You mix them up...

going to learn anything

03:59.170 --> 04:00.370

04:32.269 --> 04:33.430
- I'll bankroll you
for round one.

04:33.430 --> 04:34.529
- Okay.
- So here's the deal.

04:34.529 --> 04:35.769
Penn and Teller are going to

04:35.769 --> 04:37.100
have to make a decision
in just a moment.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.500
What I'd like you to do
is take this bill

04:38.500 --> 04:40.029
and whenever
they make the decision,

04:40.029 --> 04:42.899
place it wherever they say,
in position one, two, or three.

04:42.899 --> 04:44.129
Go ahead and take the bill.

04:44.129 --> 04:45.569
- Okay.
- Excellent.

04:45.569 --> 04:47.930
Penn, Teller,
which one's the queen?

04:47.930 --> 04:49.399
- The middle one.
- Middle one?

04:49.399 --> 04:50.899
- All right.
- Go ahead and place it down.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.329
- [whooshing sound]
- Yeah, nice job.

04:52.329 --> 04:55.269
- It's still the sound effects.
- Yeah.

04:55.269 --> 04:57.199
- They are correct.

04:57.199 --> 04:59.600
- Wow.
- That's an excellent guess.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.529

05:02.529 --> 05:05.529
- So who gets the 20?
- Well, you just lost me $20.

05:05.529 --> 05:08.569
- Oh, sorry, I do that.
- It's okay, don't worry.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.199
Everything is going
according to plan, right?

05:10.199 --> 05:12.129
What you just did is called
"setting the hook."

05:12.129 --> 05:13.370
- Oh.
- They won a little bit

05:13.370 --> 05:14.470

they're going to want to win

05:14.470 --> 05:15.670
a little bit more, right?

05:15.670 --> 05:17.329
So for round two,
all we're going to do

05:17.329 --> 05:19.000
is switch the two black sevens.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.129

05:27.230 --> 05:29.670
Bet them $50
they can't find the queen.

05:29.670 --> 05:34.329

position one, two, or three.

05:43.699 --> 05:46.430
Penn, Teller--
- [whooshing sound]

05:46.430 --> 05:47.769
- Which card
should be the queen?

05:47.769 --> 05:50.769
- Well, uh, I think
it's the one on the left.

05:50.769 --> 05:52.529
Uh, his left.
- My left?

05:52.529 --> 05:53.870
- The Irish left.
- Over there?

05:53.870 --> 05:55.000
- Yeah, yeah, right there.
- Okay.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.399
- Got you.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.769
Now, a lot of people were
rooting for the first one.

05:58.769 --> 06:00.399
A lot of people here thought
it was in the center.

06:00.399 --> 06:02.230
I know some people
may have thought it was.

06:02.230 --> 06:04.769
But it's not the queen,
it's a black seven.

06:04.769 --> 06:07.370
Unfortunately for Penn,
he placed the bet here.

06:07.370 --> 06:09.569
You would have
placed the bet here.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.769
Because that
is where the queen is.

06:11.769 --> 06:13.870
- Oh!

06:23.170 --> 06:25.230

but in each life,
a little rain must fall.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.470
- Exactly.

06:28.470 --> 06:29.699
- I have good news.
- Yeah?

06:29.699 --> 06:31.829
- Good news, right,
we're up to 30 bucks.

06:31.829 --> 06:32.970
- That's great.
- And they're mad at you

06:32.970 --> 06:35.000
because you cheated them.
- Oh, sorry guys.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.230
- We're going to go
for round three now,

06:36.230 --> 06:37.769
but we're going to do it
a little bit differently.

06:37.769 --> 06:39.730
We're going to take the third
card, and put it right there.

06:39.730 --> 06:42.170
Right, but when you do so, you
put it down very aggressively,

06:42.170 --> 06:43.730
so that it ends up
with a bend in the corner.

06:43.730 --> 06:45.699
I'm not going to say anything.
Just let them see it.

06:45.699 --> 06:47.000
The pros call this
"throwing a lug."

06:47.000 --> 06:48.670

the other card face down,

there's only two moves left.

Erik Tait,
ladies and gentleman!

08:24.199 --> 08:26.569
- Thank you.
- Come on over.

08:26.569 --> 08:28.529
Wow.
- Nice to meet you.

08:28.529 --> 08:30.000
- That's fantastic.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.669
What are people...
think when they meet you?

08:32.669 --> 08:33.970
Like, what do they
think you do?

08:33.970 --> 08:35.070
- Some people
think I'm a comedian.

08:35.070 --> 08:36.730
Other people think
I'm a magician.

08:36.730 --> 08:39.870
Uh, I'm just happy when they
hire me and their checks clear.

08:39.870 --> 08:42.029
So, that's--that's it.

08:42.029 --> 08:43.669
- And you're
a comedy writer as well.

08:43.669 --> 08:45.570
- Yeah, comedy and magic
are kind of weird, though,

08:45.570 --> 08:47.570
because comedy, uh--I think
there's a great magician

08:47.570 --> 08:49.070
who said something about how

08:49.070 --> 08:51.100
comedy is fundamentally
about telling a truth,

08:51.100 --> 08:52.230
and magic
is about fundamentally

08:52.230 --> 08:53.470
about telling a lie.

08:53.470 --> 08:55.669
And so, they don't really
work well together.

08:55.669 --> 08:58.470
So it's really a delicate
balance to try and figure out,

08:58.470 --> 09:00.629
you know, how to make things
funny and magical.

09:00.629 --> 09:03.029
- Yeah, well, I think you've
done a really good job at that.

09:03.029 --> 09:04.730
- Oh, thank you very much.
- All right.

09:04.730 --> 09:06.200
Well, let's see
what Penn and Teller thought.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.700
- Okie doke.
- Penn, Teller.

09:08.700 --> 09:10.299
- You know,
you're really funny,

09:10.299 --> 09:11.870
and it's a
really different style.

09:11.870 --> 09:14.470
It's a really nice, different
style, seeing that, uh,

09:14.470 --> 09:17.870
you know, taking a gambling
thing, the premise,

09:17.870 --> 09:19.200
and just taking it
to another place.

09:19.200 --> 09:22.669
I loved you pulling the, uh,
money out of your beard.

09:22.669 --> 09:23.870
Wicked good.

09:23.870 --> 09:26.129
What's the use
of having an ironic beard

09:26.129 --> 09:27.299
if you can't have an ironic

09:27.299 --> 09:28.730
magic trick to go with it,
right?

09:28.730 --> 09:32.029
And uh, the choreography
is just perfect.

09:32.029 --> 09:35.830
All the--all the moves
are just clean and wonderful,

09:35.830 --> 09:38.899
and timed perfectly, nothing's
even slightly awkward.

09:38.899 --> 09:41.070
But I want to do kind of
a non-sequitur here.

09:41.070 --> 09:43.100
You seem very healthy.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.870
Are you a healthy guy?

09:44.870 --> 09:47.799
- Yeah, I--I--I've been
to a gym once or...thrice.

09:47.799 --> 09:48.899
- Any, uh--

09:48.899 --> 09:50.330
Any medical work done?

09:50.330 --> 09:52.169
Like, I wondering if maybe
Doctor Leonard Green

09:52.169 --> 09:55.429
gave any laparoscopic surgery,
any of that going?

09:55.429 --> 09:57.769
- Oh, yeah, I'm
laterally aware of the idea

09:57.769 --> 09:58.830
that you're
trying to snap out there.

09:58.830 --> 10:01.470

10:01.470 --> 10:03.070

10:03.070 --> 10:05.200

we talk in code.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.500
It's not often people
talk back to us in code.

10:07.500 --> 10:10.399
That's really great.
That's really great.

10:17.769 --> 10:19.330

10:19.330 --> 10:21.570
and you made Penn
laugh very loudly.

10:21.570 --> 10:23.500
- That's really all I wanted.
- Awesome.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.570
Thank you so much.

- Please welcome
Rebecca Herrera!

11:58.029 --> 12:00.300
- Now, ladies and gentleman,

12:00.300 --> 12:03.029
I have a secret
I'd like to share with you.

12:03.029 --> 12:06.300
I am able to see with my ears.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.430
I know that sounds strange,
but basically,

12:08.430 --> 12:10.430
this is the ability
to listen to the sound

12:10.430 --> 12:11.970
of a pen on paper

12:11.970 --> 12:15.100
and translate those sounds
into images in your mind.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.470
After years of practice,

12:16.470 --> 12:19.529
I can do this with
quite complex pictures.

12:19.529 --> 12:22.369
But I had to start somewhere
quite simple.

12:22.369 --> 12:23.970
I'd like to show you
where I started,

12:23.970 --> 12:27.100
and maybe you can join in, too.

12:27.100 --> 12:29.970
So I started by drawing
a simple circle.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.700
So you may have noticed
that as I drew the circle,

12:35.700 --> 12:38.170
you could also hear me draw it.

12:38.170 --> 12:39.930
So now, I'd like
to try that again,

12:39.930 --> 12:42.430
but this time, I want you all
to close your eyes,

12:42.430 --> 12:45.369
and listen carefully
as I draw a different shape.

12:45.369 --> 12:47.369
Here we go.

12:51.700 --> 12:53.899
Okay, open your eyes.

12:53.899 --> 12:55.930
If you saw a square
appear in your mind's eye,

12:55.930 --> 12:58.200
please raise your hand.

12:58.200 --> 13:01.100
Yay, that's quite a lot of you.
Amazing.

13:01.100 --> 13:03.729
Okay, so this is
quite a basic test

13:03.729 --> 13:05.430
for seeing with your ears.

13:05.430 --> 13:07.629
But now...

13:07.629 --> 13:11.170
I'd like to take this
one step further.

13:11.170 --> 13:13.899
Teller, would you mind please
joining me on the stage?

to make a few checks.

13:26.499 --> 13:28.070

sticking out of them.

Google contact lenses.

concealed in there.

13:53.930 --> 13:55.129
I'd like you to please check

13:55.129 --> 13:56.670
that there's nothing
concealed inside it,

please helping me

tie this around my eyes?

14:15.330 --> 14:17.529
Make sure it's nice and tight.

14:21.830 --> 14:23.269
Lovely, thank you so much.

14:23.269 --> 14:25.869
So now, I'd like you to
draw something on the board.

14:25.869 --> 14:28.330
Um, please make sure
it's nothing too simple,

14:28.330 --> 14:31.729
like a shape, nothing too
obvious, like a flower,

14:31.729 --> 14:36.129
and nothing too complicated,
like a Mona Lisa, or a Picasso.

14:36.129 --> 14:38.629
Um, but something
that you could draw in say,

14:38.629 --> 14:42.529
10 to 15 seconds, and that
everyone here will recognize.

14:42.529 --> 14:44.100
Once you've finished
your drawing,

14:44.100 --> 14:46.670
please recap the pen,
place it in my hand,

14:46.670 --> 14:48.899

to the side of the board.

- He does.

16:30.670 --> 16:32.830

- He draws very quietly.

- Yes, it was nerve-wracking.

that they get to have

and are short or long,

17:07.300 --> 17:10.770

kind of build it together

Oh...

- Oh...

34:20.668 --> 34:22.629
you...

34:22.629 --> 34:26.299
you don't look crazy.
But you clearly are.

34:26.299 --> 34:29.100
- I don't consider it crazy.
I consider it well-calculated.

34:29.100 --> 34:32.569
- Oh, I don't.
That was terrifying.

34:32.569 --> 34:35.069
- For me as well.
- Ugh, okay.

34:35.069 --> 34:38.399
I just--I was thinking about
your family, and like,

34:38.399 --> 34:39.799
oh, yuck, yuck.

34:39.799 --> 34:41.899
- Well, my own son
is the reason I'm here.

34:41.899 --> 34:44.168
- Really, so he
likes you doing this?

34:44.168 --> 34:46.129
- He loves my stunts,
and more importantly,

34:46.129 --> 34:48.000
he's a big Penn and Teller fan.
- Oh, well that's good.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.870
- And he asked me
if I could come up

34:49.870 --> 34:51.399
with a trick for the show,
so I did.

34:51.399 --> 34:54.029
- Wow, and here you are.
- We made it.

34:54.029 --> 34:57.029
- Does he want to do magic?
- My son does magic already.

34:57.029 --> 34:59.600
He has a little magic kit,
and practices the tricks.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.299
Starting to learn
some juggling as well.

35:01.299 --> 35:02.669
- Oh, fantastic.

35:02.669 --> 35:04.299
Oh, he must be thrilled
you're here.

35:04.299 --> 35:06.169
- He is so happy.
- All right.

35:06.169 --> 35:09.370
Let's see if Penn and Teller
figured out your trick.

35:09.370 --> 35:11.299
- Well, Ian,
this is a really good routine,

35:11.299 --> 35:15.969
and we know something, that um,
no other show would talk about.

35:15.969 --> 35:18.330
And I want to talk about it,
and that is we know

35:18.330 --> 35:21.500
you would not
be allowed on this show

35:21.500 --> 35:23.000
if you were doing
something dangerous.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.730
We both believe that
that is not only,

35:25.730 --> 35:28.330
um, stupid, it's also immoral.

35:28.330 --> 35:30.230
You would not
ever do that to Alyson.

35:30.230 --> 35:32.730
So you were
controlling our feelings.

35:32.730 --> 35:34.830
You were controlling
all our anxiety.

35:34.830 --> 35:36.270
There's nothing
that I like better

35:36.270 --> 35:38.230
than things that look
really dangerous,

35:38.230 --> 35:41.029
and are really, really safe.
That's what art should be.

35:41.029 --> 35:42.730
No one should ever
be hurt doing art,

35:42.730 --> 35:44.200
and you did
a wonderful job at that.

35:44.200 --> 35:47.370
And we think the most beautiful
thing you have on stage

35:47.370 --> 35:49.270
is that tangled wires.

35:49.270 --> 35:53.469
What better way to show chaos

35:53.469 --> 35:56.370
than something
that beautifully ugly?

35:56.370 --> 35:57.930
All tangled up there.

35:57.930 --> 36:00.969
But I want to say,
my biggest compliment to you

36:00.969 --> 36:03.399
is you did something that kept
us on the edge of our seats,

36:03.399 --> 36:05.230
was really, really terrifying,

36:05.230 --> 36:07.230
and yet you were in control
all the time.

36:07.230 --> 36:08.930
And you did not
put that on Alyson.

36:08.930 --> 36:10.270
[both laugh]

36:10.270 --> 36:11.700
- You're correct.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.969
- So they figured it out?
- They did.

36:13.969 --> 36:15.799
- Aw, well, thank you.

You know, Dan, there's this
feeling about Penn and Teller

that Teller does all the magic
and I just talk.

37:22.600 --> 37:25.629
But I think you'd agree with me
that all that really matters

37:25.629 --> 37:28.730
in any performance ensemble
is the vocalist.

37:34.700 --> 37:36.629

say the right stuff,

37:36.629 --> 37:39.700
and do the right vocal,
it's always successful.

37:39.700 --> 37:42.730
So we're going to have you just
do the vocal on this trick,

37:42.730 --> 37:44.430

will work out itself.

follow your directions,

37:59.700 --> 38:01.669

Just repeat what I say.
