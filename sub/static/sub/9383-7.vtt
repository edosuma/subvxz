WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:03.378
Come on, everyone.

00:03.462 --> 00:05.881
The Eight is Enough reunion show
is about to start.

00:05.964 --> 00:08.175
Mary, have you seen Nicholas?

00:08.300 --> 00:10.177
He's up in his room sulking, Dad.

00:10.302 --> 00:13.847
Yeah. He's still upset
because Abby threw out his baseball cards.

00:13.931 --> 00:16.225
Maybe I should make him a sandwich.

00:16.308 --> 00:17.392
[Laughing]

00:17.726 --> 00:20.521
Dad. That's your solution to everything.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.732
[Sister crying]

00:24.483 --> 00:26.235
Dad!

00:26.318 --> 00:27.319
What?

00:27.402 --> 00:29.029
Eight is enough.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.697
[Laughing]

00:32.699 --> 00:34.701
You know, I love you girls.

00:36.995 --> 00:40.207
LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

00:40.290 --> 00:43.627
"is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:43.794 --> 00:47.297
"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

00:47.381 --> 00:49.925
"on which we used to rely?

00:50.467 --> 00:53.095
"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

"all the things that make us

00:58.684 --> 01:00.269
"laugh 'n' cry

01:00.394 --> 01:05.315
"He's a family guy"

01:07.651 --> 01:08.652
Splendid.

01:08.735 --> 01:12.197
That hausfrau's cheap rayon blouses
will make a serviceable parachute...

01:12.281 --> 01:14.908
...should I need to abandon
my jet in mid-flight.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.410
Once it's built, of course.

01:16.493 --> 01:19.037
Rupert, did you call that engineer
at Lockheed yet?

01:19.955 --> 01:22.666
No, of course you didn't,
you worthless little....

01:22.749 --> 01:27.129
There! See what you made me do?
Do you think I enjoy hitting you?

01:27.212 --> 01:30.174
Actually, I do. I enjoy it so much
I'm going to do it again!

01:30.799 --> 01:34.303
Stewie! My clothes are not for you
to play with, understand?

01:34.595 --> 01:36.180
Thanks for telling me, Brian.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.891
I don't know what we'd do without you.

01:39.975 --> 01:44.855
I'm on to you. Your pathetic attempts to
hinder my work have not gone unnoticed.

01:45.397 --> 01:48.108
You prance about this house
like the cock of the walk.

01:48.192 --> 01:52.112
But will you be prancing
when there's nothing to prance about?

01:53.822 --> 01:55.866
Will you be prancing then?

01:56.325 --> 01:57.910
You just want to eat him up.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.372
MEG: It is so hot out there!

02:02.456 --> 02:03.957
How hot is it?

02:04.208 --> 02:07.586
I don't know. Like, around 98, 99.

02:08.170 --> 02:09.588
I don't get it.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.256
I think I'm a little sweaty.

02:11.340 --> 02:14.968
You! You seem to know all the players
in this poorly-acted farce.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.803
What do they call that one?

02:16.887 --> 02:19.223
That's Meg, dude. You know that.

02:19.306 --> 02:23.268
Meg! You vile-smelling girl,
you're not to touch any of my things!

02:23.352 --> 02:25.979
You understand me? Dirty girl.

02:27.523 --> 02:29.233
DIANE: Meanwhile, here at home....

02:29.316 --> 02:32.152
...Quahog remains in the sweltering grip
of a freak heat wave.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.488
I don't think you should use
the word "freak".

02:34.571 --> 02:36.406
Some people might find it offensive.

02:37.366 --> 02:41.370
-Finish your oatmeal, son.
-Why bother? I'm just a freak!

02:43.956 --> 02:46.333
We're all a little different, Diane.
Each of us.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.417
Good point.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.963
We're even feeling the effects
of this heat wave here in our studio.

02:51.046 --> 02:53.882
[Sneezing] Freak.
So stay inside and stay cool.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.051
I think I saw one of her nipples!

02:56.134 --> 02:59.263
Chris, that's a terrible word! "Nipple."

02:59.429 --> 03:01.765
I'll chalk that up to the heat, mister.

03:01.849 --> 03:05.644
Am I to strut about all day like
a beggar child on the streets of Calcutta?

03:05.769 --> 03:08.897
Fetch me something linen to throw on
before I call Child Services!

03:08.981 --> 03:12.150
Please don't threaten Mommy.
She's very hot.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.695
Chris, you're hogging up all the fans!

03:14.778 --> 03:18.323
Yeah? You're hogging up all the ugly!

03:18.532 --> 03:19.950
Check this out, you guys.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.078
PETER: The Rhode Island Dog Show
Championship is in Quahog this year!

03:23.161 --> 03:25.914
-First prize is $500!
-Really?

03:26.206 --> 03:29.543
If you won, we could use that money
for a new air conditioner.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.378
Brian. You could win for sure.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.298
You could do your impression
of a barbershop quartet.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.593
[Singing] "We were sailing along

03:37.926 --> 03:41.722
"On Moonlight Bay

03:41.805 --> 03:45.601
"We could hear the voices singing

03:46.059 --> 03:48.687
"They seemed to say"

03:48.979 --> 03:51.982
Sorry. I don't do dog shows.
It's not my thing.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.610
Come on.
All you gotta do is a few simple commands.

03:54.693 --> 03:57.905
And maybe a trick or two.
It'll be like taking candy from a baby.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.781
[Baby gurgling]

04:05.746 --> 04:06.830
Please, Brian.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.000
I don't know. I mean
I don't even know where my papers are.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.960
Can't you get the money another way?

04:12.044 --> 04:14.796
I've been trying.
That's why I went on that game show.

04:15.172 --> 04:19.760
For $800, this chemical dye is found
in over 95% of all cosmetic products.

04:19.843 --> 04:20.844
Diarrhea.

04:20.928 --> 04:21.929
[Laughter]

04:22.012 --> 04:23.013
What?

04:23.096 --> 04:25.432
Sorry. What is Diarrhea?

04:25.807 --> 04:29.061
Come on, Brian.
We really need a new air conditioner.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.397
[Groaning]

04:34.399 --> 04:36.610
Okay, let's go over the commands.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.070
Sit.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.449
Good. Roll over.

04:42.533 --> 04:45.452
I'm already shvitzing like crazy here.
Let's call it a night.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.162
Do you want to win this thing or not?

04:47.246 --> 04:49.915
We haven't even talked
about how you'll wear your ears.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.667
I was thinking up.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.293
I need a cocktail.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.295
Don't push too hard, Peter.

04:55.379 --> 04:58.215
You gotta take Brian's feelings
into consideration.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.551
After all, it's only a dog show.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.052
Lois, honey, I love you...

05:02.135 --> 05:04.805
...but you're sucking all the energy
out of the room.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.770
[Knocking on door]

05:11.854 --> 05:12.855
Come.

05:12.938 --> 05:16.525
I got you a little something for the show.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.153
It's Italian. Do you like it?

05:20.445 --> 05:21.989
It's exquisite.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.949
It's not for every day.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.326
Clearly. I'm gonna put it on right now.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.246
I know how hard you've been working.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.082
And the whole family appreciates it.

05:32.374 --> 05:33.500
Thank you, Lois.

05:33.584 --> 05:37.045
I should go. We'll be waiting downstairs
whenever you're ready.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.172
And Brian...

05:39.339 --> 05:41.133
...you look very handsome.

ANNOUNCER: Welcome to the Quahog Dog
Show. Today's competition will be...

05:54.479 --> 05:57.983
...almost as hot as the weather,
which is once again in the triple digits.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.067
[Bird squawks]

06:04.531 --> 06:07.659
Peter, I'm not really comfortable
with all this.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.953
Do I know you?

06:10.787 --> 06:12.414
I don't think I can do this.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.541
You can't back out now. How about a pill?

06:14.625 --> 06:18.879
-Something to relax you before you go on?
-Peter, are you offering Brian drugs?

06:18.962 --> 06:22.883
Not drugs. Just a little blue thing
celebrities take to help them perform.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.010
Well, those celebrities are wrong!

06:25.093 --> 06:29.056
Lois, if Liza is wrong,
then I don't want to know what right is.

STAGEHAND:
Two minutes to curtain, Miss Minnelli!

06:31.767 --> 06:36.730
Come on, baby! Mama's gotta sparkle!
It's time to make life a cabaret!

06:36.855 --> 06:40.734
Lady, for God's sake, I'm just
a hard-shelled chocolate candy! Get help!

[Grunting]

06:43.529 --> 06:44.821
You there, child-woman!

06:44.905 --> 06:48.283
I'll give you a shiny dime
if you'll roll me into the nearest lake.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.452
Let me see if I can find you a juice box.

06:50.536 --> 06:52.454
And get the lead out, pudgy!

06:52.538 --> 06:55.123
ANNOUNCER:
Next, Peter Griffin and his dog, "Brain".

06:55.207 --> 06:57.251
We're off to a good start.

[Dramatic instrumental music]

07:12.266 --> 07:15.185
ANNOUNCER: A beautiful performance
from "Brain" Griffin!

Go, Brian!

07:16.687 --> 07:18.230
[Crowd applauding]

07:18.313 --> 07:20.816
All right, Brian. We got it all sewn up.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.317
What the hell is this?

07:22.401 --> 07:25.654
This? This is the part
where you beg for a treat.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.364
I don't think so.

07:27.865 --> 07:29.741
Brian, you're embarrassing me.

07:30.659 --> 07:33.370
God, he can't expect Brian to do that.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.581
It's easier than it looks, Mom.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.416
Come on, Brian. We had a deal.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.084
Yeah? The deal's off.

07:39.168 --> 07:43.297
Me and the little shred of dignity
I have left will be waiting in the car!

07:43.380 --> 07:45.966
Brian, come! Don't you walk out on me!

07:47.968 --> 07:49.720
I now command you to leave.

07:49.803 --> 07:53.223
Keep going. Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, flip me off. Good boy.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.308
[Giggling]

07:58.061 --> 08:00.230
How could you let me down
like that, Brian?

08:00.314 --> 08:03.150
I let you down?
Because I refused to demean myself...

08:03.233 --> 08:05.944
...by perpetuating the stereotype
of the good dog?

08:06.028 --> 08:08.697
This is the one thing I ever asked you
to do for us.

08:08.780 --> 08:12.201
This and not do that thing where you
drag your ass across the carpet.

08:12.576 --> 08:13.911
One time I did that!

08:13.994 --> 08:15.412
Peter, Brian, please.

08:15.495 --> 08:19.082
Let's just have a nice family car ride
like we always do.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.960
Yeah.
Except for the time Dad hit that deer.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.881
Yeah, it looks like it's just a ding.

08:25.964 --> 08:28.634
There's no reason to involve
the insurance companies.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.928
I should still take down your information.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.388
Really? You could probably just
buff that out.

08:33.472 --> 08:34.765
Yeah, but I....

08:35.265 --> 08:38.185
I would really feel better
if I got your information.

08:38.602 --> 08:40.771
Brian, maybe I had you pegged wrong.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.148
Maybe you really don't care
about this family.

08:43.232 --> 08:46.777
If you cared about me, you'd never
ask me to do something so degrading.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.447
The next time I ask you to do something,
I expect you to do it. Understand?

08:50.531 --> 08:52.741
Who wants to sing show tunes?
"In old...."

08:52.866 --> 08:53.867
BRIAN: Stop the car.

PETER: Is that what you want?
Because I'll stop.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.163
BRIAN: Pull over now.
PETER: Fine.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.501
God. Brian, don't do this.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.798
Is the doggie going bye-bye? I'm so sad.

09:08.757 --> 09:09.842
Quick! Back up!

09:11.844 --> 09:14.054
[Sorrowful instrumental music]

09:16.014 --> 09:19.393
Great. Is there a problem, Officer?

09:19.476 --> 09:21.436
Can I see your license, boy?

09:21.520 --> 09:22.521
"Boy"?

09:22.604 --> 09:26.233
Oh, God. I left it on my other collar.

-You been chasing cars tonight, boy?
-Look, the name is Brian.

09:29.778 --> 09:31.321
I was just out for a little walk.
That's all.

09:31.405 --> 09:32.990
Without a leash.

09:33.574 --> 09:37.452
I'm gonna have to ask you to lie down
on the sidewalk. Down!

09:38.120 --> 09:39.913
I don't believe this.

09:40.664 --> 09:43.417
I don't suppose you could let us off
with a warning?

09:43.500 --> 09:46.295
Sorry, sir.
But leash laws are for his own good.

09:46.378 --> 09:49.548
The fine is $10.
You behave, little fella, you hear me?

09:49.631 --> 09:51.842
[Slave voice]
Lordy, I'll never roam again!

09:52.801 --> 09:53.844
Jackass.

He's the law outside this house
just like I'm the law inside this house.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.684
-And you better start obeying both of us.
-Look at you.

10:00.767 --> 10:04.396
Big man, can't even afford to buy
an air conditioner for your family.

10:04.771 --> 10:05.939

10:07.399 --> 10:10.611
DIANE: Good morning Quahog.
The heat wave has finally broken.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.530
It sure has. You know what they say,
"If you don't like...

"...the weather in New England,
go back where you came from."

10:16.533 --> 10:18.410
I don't think that's the expression.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.455
I guess I had too many
bloody marys this morning. But anyway....

I don't know how those two manage
to be so perky in the morning.

What the hell are you doing,
you crazy bitch?

Cinnamon buns are his favorite.

10:43.852 --> 10:44.853
Really?

10:44.937 --> 10:48.106
I could've sworn his favorite was
"treat Peter like crap" buns.

My, your summer coat is really
coming in nicely. Isn't it, Peter?

10:55.531 --> 11:00.744
Yeah. Must be that special jojoba shampoo
I bought you. It cost a little extra.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.789
But I would do anything for you, Brian.
