(SIGHS) Welcome home.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.181
You really think
it's gonna be that bad?

00:16.183 --> 00:17.649
I haven't been
back to Krownest

00:17.651 --> 00:20.886
since before my time at
the Imperial Academy, Ezra.

00:20.888 --> 00:23.455
And I didn't exactly
leave on good terms.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.524
Well, maybe
things have changed.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.859
They might be
happy to see you.

Your mother is the leader
of Clan Wren, Sabine.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.334
She may be
with the Empire now,

00:35.336 --> 00:39.238
but I believe her true loyalty
lies with Mandalore.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.508
Even if that were true,
she thinks I'm a traitor.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.643
If you can convince
your mother to
help the rebels,

00:44.645 --> 00:47.746
all of Mandalore might follow
you and the Darksaber.

00:48.815 --> 00:50.749
Ah, I should let them
know we're coming

00:50.751 --> 00:51.917
so they don't shoot us down.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.815
Didn't you tell them
who you were?

01:56.817 --> 01:58.650
That's probably why
they're shooting at us.

recruiting the Wrens

02:50.838 --> 02:52.871

than I thought.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.306
You weren't easy
to recruit either.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.008
So we switch to plan B.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.276
Better stay out of sight.

I have a feeling
we're gonna need you later.

related to these guys.

would happen here, Sabine?

with open arms?

expecting us

It won't.

it's everything I can do
to keep the other Clans

from destroying us
because of what you did.

06:58.051 --> 07:01.052

the Empire would use
the weapon I designed

07:01.054 --> 07:03.021

But you don't believe me,
do you?

it wouldn't change

from seeing you as a traitor.

and mine are not.

that way. All of them.

Hmm, I didn't even know
she had a brother.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.784
I mean, it's not that
she didn't want to
talk about you,

08:05.786 --> 08:06.852
but she just, I don't know,

08:06.854 --> 08:09.154
she never really talked
about you before.

the negotiating.

08:18.297 --> 08:20.599
How could you align
with the Empire?

08:20.601 --> 08:23.034
After everything
they've done
to our people,

08:23.036 --> 08:25.103
after what they made me do.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.006
Do you think
I didn't try to stop it?

08:28.008 --> 08:30.942
There was nothing
I could do, Sabine.

08:30.944 --> 08:34.212
Mandalore was on its knees
before the Emperor.

08:34.214 --> 08:37.249
After he put Saxon in power,
we had a choice.

08:37.817 --> 08:39.284
Side with him

08:39.286 --> 08:42.053
or Clan Wren
would be destroyed.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.221
Your father...

08:43.223 --> 08:44.890
Please, don't tell me.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.225
He's alive.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.027
On Mandalore.

08:49.029 --> 08:52.230
A captive
in everything but name.

08:52.232 --> 08:55.000
But if Clan Wren acts
against the Empire...

08:55.002 --> 08:56.101
They'll kill him.

08:57.904 --> 08:59.504
Why didn't you
try and find me?

08:59.506 --> 09:00.672
Find you?

09:00.674 --> 09:04.576
Sabine, when you ran away,
it saved you.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.378
Don't you understand?

09:06.380 --> 09:09.247
Coming back here
has put you in danger.

09:09.249 --> 09:12.651
As much danger
as holding that blade.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.320
Where did you get it?

09:15.322 --> 09:16.555
From Maul.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.857
You won it from him
in combat?

09:18.859 --> 09:20.191
Uh, not exactly, I...

09:20.193 --> 09:22.894
Then you have
no claim to it.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.730
Well, I'm holding it.
That's a pretty good claim.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.233
Anyone can hold
the Darksaber.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.703
The trick is keeping it,
along with your head.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.772
Do you even know
how to wield that blade?

09:33.774 --> 09:35.173
You'd be surprised.

09:35.175 --> 09:38.076
Always so immature,
so selfish.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.011
Yeah, and what about you?

09:40.013 --> 09:43.348
Always putting
power and politics
before your own family.

09:43.350 --> 09:46.751
Everything I do is to
protect my family, Sabine!

09:46.753 --> 09:48.353
Please!
You do it for control.

09:57.363 --> 09:59.898
And your father
called me stubborn.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.200
Now I see it in you.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.635
What do you see?

10:03.637 --> 10:05.203
A warrior.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.772
Not the one
I'd hoped, but still...

10:10.076 --> 10:11.576
Well, I am your daughter.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.211
How could I be anything less?

are planning something,

It'd be the first real blow
to the Empire

that they can be defeated.

than just a blind Jedi
and some child.

are growing every day.

but it needs a strong leader.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.647

11:04.831 --> 11:06.464
No, but it's nothing

11:06.466 --> 11:08.767

won't work out.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.602

Sure.

It's been a long time

what it's taken for her
just to be here.

You should listen to her.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.384
She's a child.

I believe
you're underestimating

Why would Clan Wren
ever side with
the Empire anyway?

your family were
true Mandalorians,

You have no idea what
you're talking about, boy.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.632
I know that
she was telling the truth

12:47.634 --> 12:49.300
about the Protectors before.

12:49.302 --> 12:52.303
Sabine and I
fought Gar Saxon
on Concord Dawn.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.572
He was proud
that he wiped them all out.

12:54.574 --> 12:57.976
Sabine,
she fought Governor Saxon?

12:57.978 --> 12:59.544
Yeah, she did.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.412
And she held her own.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.249
Then I'm afraid what
I have to do is unfortunate.

(GRUNTING)

13:21.667 --> 13:23.268
Ah!

13:23.270 --> 13:26.171
(PANTING) You've been
practicing, brother.

13:30.943 --> 13:33.678
Let me guess.
You think I'm a traitor too.

13:34.346 --> 13:36.114
No.

13:36.116 --> 13:39.150
But when you left,
the other clans
turned their backs on us.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.286
We lost everything!

13:41.288 --> 13:43.521
Our power in the capitol,

13:43.523 --> 13:46.758
our respect and our honor.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.327
If I can restore
our family's name,

13:49.329 --> 13:50.929
if I can protect Father,

13:50.931 --> 13:52.363
then I have to try.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.098

Gar Saxon cannot be trusted.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.738
Enough to trade the Jedi
for your safety.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.541
(ENGINES RUMBLING DISTANTLY)

14:03.543 --> 14:05.376
Mother, what have you done?

14:15.454 --> 14:16.554
You can't do this!

14:18.357 --> 14:19.591
SAXON: Yes, she can.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.361
Because she is loyal.

14:24.129 --> 14:25.563
Just not to you.

14:30.569 --> 14:32.804
I believe you have
something else for me.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.475
No!

14:37.477 --> 14:40.745
Sabine, this is for the best.

14:42.581 --> 14:45.350
I've upheld
my end of the bargain, Saxon.

14:45.352 --> 14:46.885
You have the Darksaber.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.520
Take the Jedi
and let my daughter go.

14:49.522 --> 14:52.757
Your mother betrayed
everything you believe in
to save you.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.726
It's admirable,

14:54.728 --> 14:57.762
except she consorted
with known traitors to do it.

14:59.431 --> 15:01.366
What are you talking about?

15:01.368 --> 15:04.269
Why, Countess,
you are harboring
rebels here.

15:04.271 --> 15:07.005
Clan Wren is clearly
a threat to the Empire

15:07.007 --> 15:09.140
and must be
made an example of.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.579
Governor, wait!

15:14.581 --> 15:16.114
It doesn't have to
be this way.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.249
We are all Mandalorians.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.686
I've been fair to you,
Tristan,
and you've served me well.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.521
I'll give you a choice.

15:23.523 --> 15:27.492
Stand with me,
or die with your family.

15:38.537 --> 15:40.705
I choose family.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.441
Then Clan Wren ends here.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.776
(DARKSABER HUMMING)

15:44.778 --> 15:46.477
(GLASS SHATTERS)

15:48.814 --> 15:50.882
Took you long enough!

15:50.884 --> 15:51.983
Rau!

15:51.985 --> 15:53.284
I've been busy.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.726
Remember,
only blast the guys...

16:01.728 --> 16:03.328
In white, I got it.

16:11.570 --> 16:12.537
Ah!

16:23.849 --> 16:24.916
(GRUNTS)

16:29.121 --> 16:30.221
Sabine!

16:37.963 --> 16:39.597
You will be taken
back to Mandalore

16:39.599 --> 16:41.366
to finish what you started,

16:41.368 --> 16:43.434
the last living member
of the Wren Clan.

16:52.111 --> 16:53.378
Sabine!

16:59.051 --> 17:01.586
(BOTH GRUNTING)

17:13.032 --> 17:16.501
By Mandalorian
custom and law,
no one can interfere.

17:16.503 --> 17:17.835
Are your customs
more important

17:17.837 --> 17:19.370
than the life
of your daughter?

17:36.655 --> 17:37.755
Ah!

17:43.028 --> 17:44.796
(CRACKLING)

17:47.733 --> 17:48.666
(GRUNTS)

17:50.536 --> 17:51.669
I'm impressed.

17:51.671 --> 17:52.937
You have some skill.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.939
But not enough to save you.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.240
That's funny.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.476
I was about to say
the same thing to you.

18:02.281 --> 18:03.514
(SHOUTS)

18:19.932 --> 18:21.032
Oh!

18:21.034 --> 18:22.100
(PANTING)

18:23.969 --> 18:25.203
Yield.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.645
I'll never
yield to you, girl.

18:34.647 --> 18:35.847
You'll have to kill me.

18:42.754 --> 18:45.756
That might be
the Mandalorian way,

18:45.758 --> 18:47.158
but it's not my way.

18:47.793 --> 18:48.826
Not anymore.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.706
(BLASTER FIRES)

19:04.743 --> 19:07.812
(WIND WHISTLING)

19:17.289 --> 19:18.389
Mother.

19:19.124 --> 19:21.459
No one threatens our family.

19:21.461 --> 19:24.095
Gar Saxon was guilty
of treason against the throne,

19:24.097 --> 19:25.863
collaboration with our enemy,

19:25.865 --> 19:28.799
and the execution
of my fellow Protectors.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.769
But when the rest of Mandalore
finds out about his death,

19:31.771 --> 19:33.137
there will be chaos.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.439
Perhaps Mandalore needs chaos

19:35.441 --> 19:37.808
if it's to become
strong once again,

19:37.810 --> 19:42.046
and so that
we may find a leader
worthy of our people.

19:48.453 --> 19:49.987
(GRUNTING)

19:49.989 --> 19:52.723
Sure, now you show up
when all the fighting is over.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.525
(GRUNTING)

19:54.527 --> 19:55.693
The Empire will
come for you

19:55.695 --> 19:57.328
once they find out
what's happened here.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.563
The Rebellion can help.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.299
The same Rebellion
that sent you for my help?

20:01.867 --> 20:02.733
No.

20:02.735 --> 20:05.870
Mandalore must
rise by itself.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.172
We protect our own.

20:08.174 --> 20:09.941
So do we. Sabine?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.910
She's right.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.713
Wait. You're not
coming with us?

20:15.715 --> 20:16.847
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

20:16.849 --> 20:18.749
I'm done running away.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.551
My father's
on Mandalore.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.420
We'll find a way
to get him back.

20:22.754 --> 20:24.255
And then...

20:24.257 --> 20:27.225
Then maybe we can
join the fight
against the Empire.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.093
But right now,

20:29.095 --> 20:30.561
I can do
more good here.

20:32.264 --> 20:33.397
(GRUNTING SADLY)

20:35.667 --> 20:36.734
I am so...

20:36.736 --> 20:38.302
Do not say
you're proud of me.

20:38.937 --> 20:40.271
Me? Never.

20:43.675 --> 20:45.610
But I am
going to miss you.

20:45.612 --> 20:46.844
We all will.

20:52.050 --> 20:54.485
Thank you. Both of you.

21:06.965 --> 21:08.766
You did well today.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.869
All of Clan Wren saw
who you've become.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.938
You could lead Mandalore.

21:13.940 --> 21:14.939
No.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.241
This was about my family.

21:17.243 --> 21:19.243
I'm not Mandalore's leader.

21:19.245 --> 21:21.012
But I'll find
the person who is.
