PRESIDENT REAGAN: <i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

00:08.758 --> 00:11.592
launched a series of strikes
against terrorist facilities...

00:11.593 --> 00:14.153
REPORTER: Pan Am Flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.

00:14.154 --> 00:15.794
REAGAN: <i>He has sanctioned
acts of terror</i>

00:15.795 --> 00:17.315
<i>in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.</i>

00:17.316 --> 00:20.441
PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH: This will not
stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.

00:20.442 --> 00:22.162
<i>REAGAN: This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

00:22.163 --> 00:24.443
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:
We will make no distinction...

00:24.444 --> 00:25.884
REPORTER:
The USS Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:25.885 --> 00:27.325
<i>while refueling in the port of Aden.</i>

00:27.326 --> 00:28.486
This was an act of terrorism.

00:28.487 --> 00:30.944
It was a despicable and cowardly act.

00:30.945 --> 00:33.092
<i>The next samba we're going to swing for you</i>

00:33.093 --> 00:34.413
is one of the good old favorites.

00:34.414 --> 00:37.016
...until something stops him.

00:37.017 --> 00:39.886
CARRIE: <i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

00:39.887 --> 00:43.422
MAN: <i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:44.792 --> 00:47.093
Thousands of people running.

00:47.094 --> 00:50.796
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:50.797 --> 00:53.098
(speaking Arabic)

00:57.436 --> 00:59.938
SAUL:
What the fuck are you doing?

00:59.939 --> 01:01.940
CARRIE: <i>Fuck!</i>

01:01.941 --> 01:03.942
CARRIE: <i>I missed</i>
<i>something once before.</i>

01:03.943 --> 01:06.677
<i>I won't...</i>
<i>I</i> can't <i>let that happen again.</i>

01:07.946 --> 01:10.114
SAUL:
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

01:10.115 --> 01:11.816
Everyone missed something <i>that day.</i>

01:11.817 --> 01:13.784
CARRIE:
<i>Everyone's not me.</i>

01:24.360 --> 01:26.361
Previously on Homeland...

01:26.362 --> 01:28.797
I think her lithium levels are too high.

01:28.798 --> 01:30.598
That is for her
and Dr. Rosenberg to decide.

01:30.599 --> 01:32.868
- What's going on?
- We need your help.

01:32.869 --> 01:34.703
ESTES:
Do you recognize her?

01:34.704 --> 01:37.039
Fatima Ali, first wife of Abbas Ali.

01:37.040 --> 01:39.273
She's refusing to speak to anybody but you.

01:39.274 --> 01:41.714
If you're gonna ask me to go
to Beirut, just ask me already.

01:42.038 --> 01:44.958
ROYA: <i>David Estes</i> is briefing you
tomorrow morning on homeland security.

01:44.959 --> 01:47.319
There's a safe in his office
containing the encryption key

01:47.320 --> 01:49.483
<i>to a database of potential targets.</i>

01:49.484 --> 01:51.364
BRODY: <i>If you need these,
you must be planning</i>

01:51.365 --> 01:52.854
to hit one of these targets.

01:52.855 --> 01:54.487
I am not a terrorist.

01:54.488 --> 01:56.456
There's a difference between terrorism

01:56.457 --> 01:58.625
and a justifiable act of retaliation.

01:58.626 --> 02:01.228
He's talking about turning
Tehran into a parking lot.

02:01.229 --> 02:02.709
TAD: Well, what if
I told you my dad

02:02.710 --> 02:03.790
is undersecretary of state?

02:03.791 --> 02:06.332
Yeah, well, what
if I told you my dad's a Muslim?

02:06.333 --> 02:07.493
No, seriously, I want to know

02:07.494 --> 02:09.054
why she would say such an insane thing.

02:09.055 --> 02:10.469
Because it's true.

02:10.470 --> 02:12.371
That's not supposed to touch the floor.

02:12.372 --> 02:13.405
This...

02:13.406 --> 02:16.441
this can't happen.

02:16.442 --> 02:18.677
You have a wife, two kids.

02:18.678 --> 02:21.881
You're a congressman in the
running to be vice president.

02:21.882 --> 02:23.983
It cannot happen.

02:23.984 --> 02:25.417
You get that, right?

02:25.418 --> 02:28.386
Yeah, Jess, I do.

02:28.387 --> 02:30.155
Your mom threw my Koran on the floor.

02:30.156 --> 02:31.823
It's desecrated.

02:31.824 --> 02:33.144
So I'm burying it out of respect.

02:33.145 --> 02:35.105
- How was your flight?
CARRIE: - A little bumpy.

02:35.106 --> 02:37.586
They may have made you, Carrie...
gray jacket, yellow stripes

02:37.587 --> 02:39.507
- crossing El Barghout.
- I can lose him, Saul.

02:39.508 --> 02:40.031
If you run,

02:40.032 --> 02:41.099
you'll only make it worse.

02:41.100 --> 02:42.900
If they arrest me, this mission is blown.

02:51.209 --> 02:53.010
(groans)

03:00.184 --> 03:02.584
(dogs barking)

03:05.189 --> 03:07.756
(women praying indistinctly)

03:10.861 --> 03:12.561
Salam alaikum...

03:14.330 --> 03:15.730
Salam alaikum...

03:17.133 --> 03:18.967
Salam alaikum...

03:25.607 --> 03:29.077
(whispering indistinctly)

03:42.891 --> 03:44.892
CARRIE:
Salam alaikum.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.445
What are you doing here?

04:06.446 --> 04:08.146
I was supposed to come to you.

04:08.147 --> 04:09.267
There was a change of plans.

04:09.268 --> 04:10.916
No one told me.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.753
The man you talked to... Saul...
he was followed yesterday.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.674
I remembered you always
come to Friday prayers.

04:15.675 --> 04:17.857
It seemed safer to meet you here.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.825
You dyed your hair.

04:20.826 --> 04:22.660
And your eyes.

04:22.661 --> 04:25.530
They're contacts, which
are killing me right now.

04:32.004 --> 04:35.305
He said you're not in the CIA anymore.

04:36.608 --> 04:38.642
That's right.

04:38.643 --> 04:41.378
So you can't speak for them.

04:41.379 --> 04:46.349
Fatima, they just flew me
6,000 miles to talk to you.

04:46.350 --> 04:49.185
What do you have?

04:49.186 --> 04:51.020
Eight years ago you told me

04:51.021 --> 04:53.188
there was a reward for Abu Nazir.

04:53.189 --> 04:55.391
Abu Nazir?

04:55.392 --> 04:56.526
Yes.

04:56.527 --> 04:59.061
- $5 million.
- That's right.

04:59.062 --> 05:01.898
And you'll fly me out of here
to the United States?

05:01.899 --> 05:03.132
I have a cousin in Detroit.

05:03.133 --> 05:04.366
I'll get you there.

05:04.367 --> 05:05.535
I need you to promise me.

05:05.536 --> 05:08.069
I promise, absolutely.

05:08.070 --> 05:11.239
Fatima, tell me what you
know about Abu Nazir.

05:11.240 --> 05:15.577
He's meeting my husband
tomorrow, here in Beirut.

05:15.578 --> 05:17.579
You can kill them both.

05:19.882 --> 05:22.083
(jazz playing)

05:39.032 --> 05:41.033
Well, I just had some distressing news.

05:41.034 --> 05:45.304
Israel's air strikes against
Iran's nuclear facilities...

05:45.305 --> 05:47.039
only partially successful.

05:47.040 --> 05:50.376
Yeah, I heard there were rumors.

05:50.377 --> 05:52.979
The rumors are true.

05:52.980 --> 05:55.420
One of the sites is too deeply
buried for Israeli ordinance.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.148
They need a bigger bomb.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.618
Our hosts here have a
penetrating bunker buster

05:59.619 --> 06:04.122
that will get the job done,
but they just told me

06:04.123 --> 06:06.391
the president's blocking
the export license.

06:06.392 --> 06:07.793
The president himself?

06:07.794 --> 06:11.261
Our commander in
chief, so-called.

06:11.262 --> 06:13.706
Well,

06:13.707 --> 06:15.867
it's not exactly a secret
that Israel has been trying

06:15.868 --> 06:17.702
to get our bunker busters.

06:17.703 --> 06:21.672
The cry on the Arab street
would be "U.S. bombs Iran."

06:21.673 --> 06:23.513
You really give a shit
about the Arab street?

06:23.514 --> 06:25.977
They yell "Death to
America," whatever we do.

06:28.312 --> 06:30.413
The president is not
protecting this country.

06:30.414 --> 06:32.649
He is just riding out his term,

06:32.650 --> 06:34.551
and if that means leaving a nuclear Iran

06:34.552 --> 06:38.788
for the next administration
to deal with, what's he care?

06:38.789 --> 06:41.658
It falls on me.

06:43.393 --> 06:45.227
I was thinking you could help me with this.

06:45.228 --> 06:48.130
How do you mean?

06:48.131 --> 06:50.566
I'm going to see the
secretary of defense tomorrow.

06:50.567 --> 06:52.300
I'll find a discreet way to get this done.

06:54.037 --> 06:55.504
Secretary is a marine.

06:55.505 --> 06:57.225
You could help convince him of the urgency.

07:00.375 --> 07:03.044
Brody.

07:04.212 --> 07:05.246
You with me?

07:05.247 --> 07:07.448
Of course, yes.

07:10.485 --> 07:12.520
This meeting is strictly off book.

07:12.521 --> 07:13.755
No one can know.

07:24.665 --> 07:26.666
Hi.

07:29.203 --> 07:31.471
I may have something for you.

07:31.472 --> 07:33.005
What do you mean?

07:33.006 --> 07:36.176
Remember you were asking
how you can help Brody,

07:36.177 --> 07:37.610
raise his profile?

07:37.611 --> 07:40.546
I met a young man yesterday.

07:40.547 --> 07:44.783
23 years old, lost both his arms in Iraq.

07:44.784 --> 07:45.951
Oh, my God.

07:45.952 --> 07:47.619
Yeah, exactly.

07:47.620 --> 07:50.722
He's part of a group of wounded veterans.

07:50.723 --> 07:53.125
No one wants to see this stuff.

07:53.126 --> 07:55.093
They have trouble getting press.

07:55.094 --> 07:58.563
You, on the other hand,
everyone wants to see.

07:58.564 --> 08:02.400
Anyway, they have a
fund-raiser coming up,

08:02.401 --> 08:04.735
and I, I thought that we
could host it together.

08:04.736 --> 08:07.871
You taking this on...

08:07.872 --> 08:11.008
this would be good for
the vets and for Brody.

08:11.009 --> 08:15.778
I've never had to do
any real fund-raising before.

08:15.779 --> 08:17.914
Only bake sales.
(chuckles)

08:17.915 --> 08:20.650
Don't worry, I'll show you how it's done.

08:21.885 --> 08:24.754
Oh, there he is.

08:24.755 --> 08:27.389
Is my husband still off, working the room?

08:27.390 --> 08:29.358
Yeah, I think he'll be a while.

08:29.359 --> 08:31.327
We should go.

08:31.328 --> 08:32.828
So will you think about it?

08:32.828 --> 08:34.863
I'll do it.

08:34.864 --> 08:36.765
Good.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.167
Come by the house tomorrow

08:38.168 --> 08:39.934
after you pick up Dana from school.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.370
Okay.

08:41.371 --> 08:42.371
- Bye.
- Bye-Bye.

08:42.371 --> 08:43.770
(kisses)

08:43.772 --> 08:45.240
Thank you.

08:47.443 --> 08:48.843
Cynthia wants me to work

08:48.844 --> 08:50.911
with this group that helps veterans.

08:50.912 --> 08:52.447
She does?

08:52.448 --> 08:54.449
Yeah, she wants me to,
um, work on a fund-raiser.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.351
Is that okay?

08:56.352 --> 08:59.020
You know who's hosting this party, Jess?

08:59.021 --> 09:00.320
They make bombs.

09:00.321 --> 09:02.456
You really want to help veterans,

09:02.457 --> 09:04.591
you take out everybody in this room here.

09:10.198 --> 09:12.866
(buzzes)

09:14.068 --> 09:17.102
I think she's here.

09:17.103 --> 09:19.138
Thank God, buzz her in.

09:19.139 --> 09:21.219
Call Estes, tell him she's
here, and the embassy...

09:21.220 --> 09:22.875
tell them they can call off the search.

09:22.876 --> 09:25.711
(panting)

09:27.648 --> 09:29.649
(buzzes)

09:29.650 --> 09:32.250
Where the hell have you been?

09:32.251 --> 09:34.886
(sighs)

09:34.887 --> 09:37.255
We've been busting our asses
trying to find you.

09:37.256 --> 09:39.324
I got clear of that guy
who was following you,

09:39.325 --> 09:40.858
but there were militia everywhere.

09:40.859 --> 09:42.494
I had to lay low until daybreak.

09:42.495 --> 09:44.062
Well, we'll talk about it later.

09:44.063 --> 09:46.064
Fatima is scheduled
to arrive within an hour.

09:46.065 --> 09:47.105
I need to get you briefed.

09:47.106 --> 09:48.098
Not necessary.

09:48.099 --> 09:49.766
I already met her at her mosque.

09:49.767 --> 09:51.727
I remembered she's a
regular for Friday prayers.

09:51.728 --> 09:53.128
After you signaled you'd been made,

09:53.129 --> 09:55.005
it seemed safer to meet her there.

09:55.006 --> 09:58.576
Carrie, our backup plan
was to regroup here.

09:58.577 --> 10:00.311
(laughing):
I'm here now.

10:00.312 --> 10:02.479
(laughing):
You're missing the point.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.347
Which is what?

10:04.348 --> 10:06.416
I was told this was
about an attack on America.

10:06.417 --> 10:08.017
Forgive me, I thought it would be better

10:08.018 --> 10:09.498
to meet her sooner rather than later.

10:09.499 --> 10:10.379
Well, we were supposed

10:10.380 --> 10:12.220
to meet her together
so you could talk to her

10:12.221 --> 10:13.923
and I could assess her reliability.

10:13.924 --> 10:16.926
Meaning you don't trust my judgment?

10:16.927 --> 10:18.527
Meaning the entire point of the protocol

10:18.528 --> 10:20.429
was to keep your judgment out of it.

10:22.865 --> 10:26.301
We need to arrange another meet
here maybe by tomorrow.

10:26.302 --> 10:27.436
Well, that'll be too late.

10:27.437 --> 10:28.637
Why?

10:28.638 --> 10:31.506
Her husband Abbas...
he's got a meeting

10:31.507 --> 10:34.676
tomorrow morning on Hamra Street
with Abu Nazir.

10:36.811 --> 10:39.513
That's what she told me.

10:44.553 --> 10:46.621
I got to get these things out of my eyes.

10:46.622 --> 10:48.856
They're killing me.

10:52.893 --> 10:54.394
When did she check in?

10:54.395 --> 10:55.795
Less than an hour ago.

10:55.796 --> 10:57.731
We have a Skype connection ready for you.

10:57.732 --> 11:00.700
Saul asked for Special Ops
to be in on the call.

11:00.701 --> 11:02.135
He say why?

11:02.136 --> 11:05.037
No, but Ryan is waiting in your office.

11:07.707 --> 11:10.309
- Sir.
- Scott, what have we got?

11:10.310 --> 11:11.744
It's just us two on this side.

11:11.745 --> 11:13.845
Saul asked to keep the circle small.

11:13.846 --> 11:15.481
Okay.

11:15.482 --> 11:17.516
Okay, you're there.

11:17.517 --> 11:18.984
Carrie, very good to see you.

11:18.985 --> 11:20.519
You had us all worried.

11:20.520 --> 11:21.587
CARRIE:
I heard.

11:21.588 --> 11:22.688
Go ahead, we're listening.

11:22.689 --> 11:23.721
I talked to Fatima

11:23.722 --> 11:25.089
a couple of hours ago.

11:25.090 --> 11:27.258
It was highly interesting.

11:27.259 --> 11:29.894
Her husband Abbas,
the Hezbollah commander...

11:29.895 --> 11:33.898
she says he'll be meeting
in person with Abu Nazir.

11:35.534 --> 11:37.535
Abu Nazir?

11:37.536 --> 11:40.236
Yes, tomorrow right here in Beirut.

11:40.237 --> 11:42.372
The meet will be on Hamra Street.

11:42.373 --> 11:43.707
I asked operations to cue up

11:43.708 --> 11:45.676
the architectural folders for you.

11:45.677 --> 11:47.411
Scott, you might want to take a look.

11:47.412 --> 11:50.714
It's a dense residential area.

11:50.715 --> 11:53.116
So a drone strike is out of the question.

11:53.117 --> 11:56.051
Right. Which means we'd
need our people on the ground.

11:56.052 --> 11:57.486
Wait, hold on a second.

11:57.487 --> 11:59.121
These-these drawings
you're showing us,

11:59.122 --> 12:00.323
they're full of holes.

12:00.324 --> 12:01.691
That's what I wanted you to see.

12:01.692 --> 12:03.726
Area's been controlled by Hezbollah

12:03.727 --> 12:05.994
pretty much continuously
since the civil war.

12:05.995 --> 12:09.298
A lot of it was destroyed then
and has been rebuilt, but...

12:09.299 --> 12:12.066
what it looks like now,
except for what we can see

12:12.067 --> 12:15.236
on the satellite overheads,
we'll just be guessing.

12:15.237 --> 12:18.239
So my guys could be walking into anything?

12:18.240 --> 12:20.675
Just to be clear, are you suggesting

12:20.676 --> 12:23.645
that the meet is a sham
designed to lure us in?

12:23.646 --> 12:25.847
If it were, you
couldn't find a better place.

12:25.848 --> 12:27.348
No, that's not what's going on.

12:27.349 --> 12:28.709
Iran has been threatening blowback

12:28.710 --> 12:29.950
against the United States

12:29.951 --> 12:31.485
if anyone attacked its nuclear sites.

12:31.486 --> 12:33.620
Well, <i>four</i> have been reduced to dust.

12:33.621 --> 12:36.590
So they're getting ready to do
just what they said they would

12:36.591 --> 12:37.958
through Abu Nazir.

12:37.959 --> 12:39.025
Let me ask, uh,

12:39.026 --> 12:40.761
how does she know?

12:40.762 --> 12:43.596
Your asset, Carrie,
how did she get on to this?

12:43.597 --> 12:46.098
She overheard her husband
talking on a satellite phone.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.933
Discussing a plot against America?

12:47.934 --> 12:49.969
Arranging to meet Nazir.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.971
While what, wandering
through his living room?

12:51.972 --> 12:56.041
No, she overheard it;
He was speaking with Abu Nazir.

12:56.042 --> 12:58.043
Whose voice she verified how?

13:00.446 --> 13:02.247
Anyone?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.517
(sigh)

13:05.518 --> 13:07.986
Saul, she seem credible to you?

13:07.987 --> 13:09.954
I'm not really in a position to say.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.323
Uh, I met with her on my own.

13:12.324 --> 13:14.526
At Jumah, morning prayers.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.294
Wait a minute, so, Saul,
you heard none of this?

13:17.295 --> 13:19.029
No more than you.

13:19.030 --> 13:22.833
CARRIE: Her husband does
horrible things to her, David.

13:22.834 --> 13:26.737
She wants out. She asked for $5
million and a flight to Detroit.

13:26.738 --> 13:28.706
This is not some setup;
It's real.

13:28.707 --> 13:30.508
Hey, just so I understand,

13:30.509 --> 13:33.710
an informant married for years
to a Hezbollah commander

13:33.711 --> 13:36.379
turns up out of the blue
promising Abu Nazir

13:36.380 --> 13:39.348
to an ex-agent known to be
obsessed with the man.

13:39.349 --> 13:40.983
It's not out of the blue.

13:40.984 --> 13:43.019
No, it's in the middle
of an international crisis

13:43.020 --> 13:45.988
where Iran is looking for a way
to discredit the United States.

13:45.989 --> 13:47.229
They'd like nothing better than

13:47.230 --> 13:49.090
some kind of Blackhawk Down situation

13:49.091 --> 13:53.962
in a city we're not supposed
to be in in the first place.

13:53.963 --> 13:55.831
Carrie?

13:55.832 --> 13:58.901
We're gonna have to get back to you.

14:09.210 --> 14:11.045
- Hi.
- ID, please?

14:11.046 --> 14:12.547
Thank you, ma'am.

14:14.850 --> 14:16.116
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

14:21.789 --> 14:23.957
(Dana exhales)

14:23.958 --> 14:25.592
Well, fuck me.

14:25.593 --> 14:27.894
Please don't talk like that in there.

14:27.895 --> 14:30.464
I mean, what a dump, eh?

14:30.465 --> 14:32.532
JESSICA:
Come on, you can do it.

14:32.533 --> 14:34.734
All you have to do is behave for one hour.

14:34.735 --> 14:35.935
A whole hour?

14:35.936 --> 14:37.703
Man, you've got to be kidding!

14:43.076 --> 14:46.445
Hey, Dana, Dad said that,
um, you saw him praying.

14:46.446 --> 14:48.714
What was he doing, exactly?

14:48.715 --> 14:50.649
DANA:
Exactly?

14:53.318 --> 14:58.122
Allah...

15:00.860 --> 15:03.728
It was actually kind of weird.

15:03.729 --> 15:04.829
Yeah.

15:04.830 --> 15:06.063
(doorbell rings)

15:09.166 --> 15:10.901
- Thank you.
- Ma'am.

15:12.136 --> 15:13.804
Jessica!

15:13.805 --> 15:15.405
Hi.

15:15.406 --> 15:17.007
Hello.

15:17.008 --> 15:19.843
Cynthia, I'd like you
to meet my daughter, Dana.

15:19.844 --> 15:22.245
Oh, Finn's told me all about you.

15:22.246 --> 15:23.813
(laughs):
Well, that's disconcerting.

15:23.814 --> 15:26.983
Not at all. It's nice
to meet one of his friends.

15:26.984 --> 15:29.952
Dana was hoping she could find
someplace to do her homework.

15:29.953 --> 15:32.488
Oh, come in.

15:33.924 --> 15:37.627
The library is just upstairs
on the right, okay?

15:37.628 --> 15:40.595
- Thank you.
- Make yourself at home.

15:40.596 --> 15:42.430
(laughs)

15:44.466 --> 15:48.937
I want you to meet the junta
that actually runs DC.

15:48.938 --> 15:50.772
We've already decided

15:50.773 --> 15:53.942
who the keynote speaker for
this fund-raiser should be.

15:53.943 --> 15:56.276
- Who?
- Your husband.

15:56.277 --> 15:59.513
You think you can get him to do it?

15:59.514 --> 16:02.049
(birds chirping)

16:02.050 --> 16:03.884
(laughs softly)

16:38.350 --> 16:39.685
- Hi.
(whispers): - God!

16:41.721 --> 16:43.154
What's <i>your</i> problem?

16:43.155 --> 16:44.321
Nothing.

16:44.322 --> 16:46.223
Well, what are you doing here?

16:46.224 --> 16:47.925
Oh, uh...

16:47.926 --> 16:49.927
I live here.

16:49.928 --> 16:53.798
No. I mean, sneaking up behind
me like the walking dead.

16:53.799 --> 16:55.800
I just said hi.

16:55.801 --> 16:57.835
It's a standard greeting.

16:57.836 --> 17:01.437
You can be a real asshole, you know that?

17:01.438 --> 17:03.272
<i>I</i> can?

17:05.776 --> 17:07.711
Hmm.

17:07.712 --> 17:10.346
You're, like, uh...

17:10.347 --> 17:12.848
famous at school now, you know?

17:12.849 --> 17:15.351
For calling Tad a douche?

17:15.352 --> 17:19.021
No, I mean...
everyone does <i>that.</i>

17:19.021 --> 17:22.125
I mean, the whole
"my dad's a Muslim" thing.

17:22.126 --> 17:24.926
That's a brand-new
kind of crazy.

17:26.194 --> 17:28.195
(quietly):
Yeah.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.700
The dean called my mom.

17:31.701 --> 17:33.368
She must've thought it was pretty funny.

17:33.369 --> 17:35.938
Actually, she thought
it was pretty <i>unfunny.</i>

17:35.939 --> 17:38.306
Yeah, I can see that, too.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.447
What the hell are you doing?

17:46.448 --> 17:48.482
Just trying to picture you in a burka.

17:49.752 --> 17:51.085
Huh?
(chuckles)

17:51.086 --> 17:52.820
(giggles)

17:57.458 --> 18:00.694
SAUL: I'm trying, David,
I'm trying to verify

18:00.695 --> 18:02.328
any part of this woman's story.

18:02.329 --> 18:03.630
I'm coming up blank.

18:03.631 --> 18:05.966
And our best intel
puts Nazir in Afghanistan.

18:05.967 --> 18:08.434
Look, Special Ops
will do what they're told,

18:08.435 --> 18:10.496
but I got to be honest...
everyone here is worried

18:10.497 --> 18:12.337
this will end with
ambushed American soldiers

18:12.338 --> 18:14.138
being dragged through
the streets of Beirut.

18:14.139 --> 18:15.775
Everyone here, too.

18:15.776 --> 18:17.576
ESTES:
Everyone except Carrie, right?

18:17.577 --> 18:19.611
She still trusts her source?

18:19.612 --> 18:21.947
SAUL: I don't know what
Carrie's thinking right now.

18:21.948 --> 18:24.516
After our conference call
she said she had to rest.

18:24.517 --> 18:26.786
Look, Saul, I'm, uh...
I'm gonna need you

18:26.787 --> 18:29.187
to make the call on this,
whether to proceed.

18:31.323 --> 18:33.491
So it's my decision?

18:33.492 --> 18:35.052
Well, yeah, you're on the ground there.

18:35.053 --> 18:37.028
(laughs): That's
an act of fucking courage.

18:37.029 --> 18:39.530
Hey, you were supposed
to be with her the whole time.

18:39.531 --> 18:41.866
Keep her on a short leash;
That was the plan.

18:41.867 --> 18:44.187
Hey, for the record, as long
as we're covering our asses,

18:44.188 --> 18:45.868
I didn't want her here in the first place.

18:45.869 --> 18:46.749
SAUL:
She's not well.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.638
What did you think would happen?

18:48.639 --> 18:51.008
I don't know, David, I don't
know if this woman's for real

18:51.009 --> 18:52.876
or if Carrie wants her to be for real.

18:52.877 --> 18:56.880
(Saul continues indistinctly)
(erratic breathing)

19:02.220 --> 19:04.554
(erratic breathing continues)

19:09.293 --> 19:12.195
(erratic breathing continues)

19:18.468 --> 19:20.569
(hits door)

19:20.570 --> 19:22.404
(breathing rapidly)

19:22.405 --> 19:24.740
(sobs)

19:24.741 --> 19:27.476
(rapid breathing continues)

19:31.715 --> 19:34.149
(breathing slows)

19:36.719 --> 19:39.154
(breathing rapidly)

19:51.466 --> 19:54.268
(rapid breathing continues)

19:54.269 --> 19:57.704
(breathing deeply)

20:05.746 --> 20:08.181
(breathing rapidly)

20:12.052 --> 20:14.353
(sobs)

20:14.354 --> 20:16.455
(breathing rapidly)

20:22.295 --> 20:25.397
SAUL: Carrie? (sobs)

20:27.433 --> 20:29.434
Couldn't find you.

20:29.435 --> 20:32.437
Come on in.
We don't know who's watching.

20:32.438 --> 20:35.274
It's not lost on me why people
don't trust my judgment.

20:35.275 --> 20:37.374
Why you didn't even want me here.

20:37.375 --> 20:38.542
Carrie...

20:38.543 --> 20:40.077
It's not fair, I know,

20:40.078 --> 20:42.713
for you to have to be the one to decide.

20:47.186 --> 20:49.787
It fucked me up, Saul.

20:51.423 --> 20:55.125
Being wrong about Brody,
it really... it fucked me up.

20:55.126 --> 20:57.861
Because I have never been

20:57.862 --> 21:00.063
so sure...

21:00.064 --> 21:02.498
and so wrong.

21:04.368 --> 21:07.570
And it's that fact that I
still can't get my head around.

21:08.572 --> 21:10.505
It makes me unable

21:10.506 --> 21:12.141
to trust my own thoughts.

21:12.142 --> 21:15.677
Every time I think
I see something clearly now...

21:17.848 --> 21:20.149
...it just disappears.

21:27.223 --> 21:29.357
(Carrie sighs)

21:34.330 --> 21:37.098
We have a chance to get Abu Nazir.

21:37.099 --> 21:41.468
I know you want to think that.

21:41.469 --> 21:45.138
- I won't risk American lives on a hunch.
- And I would not

21:45.139 --> 21:46.874
ask you to.

21:49.878 --> 21:52.612
I recruited her, Saul,
right here in this city.

21:52.613 --> 21:54.447
And it's been eight years, I know...

21:54.448 --> 21:56.549
I know a lot of things can change.

21:58.919 --> 22:01.287
But I helped her through an abusive

22:01.288 --> 22:02.688
domestic situation.

22:02.689 --> 22:05.624
I practically saved her life.

22:05.625 --> 22:08.527
And I remember, I remember

22:08.528 --> 22:11.530
<i>knowing</i> at the time that one day...

22:11.531 --> 22:13.899
she would be ready to leave here,

22:13.900 --> 22:17.903
and when that time came,
she would be on my side.

22:22.508 --> 22:26.311
The-the way I am now,
I wouldn't trust me, either.

22:28.014 --> 22:31.581
But the Carrie who recruited her...

22:36.054 --> 22:39.390
...that one I believe.

22:59.276 --> 23:01.944
Sir? Saul Berenson
just called. We're on.

23:01.945 --> 23:03.946
The operation's a go.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.791
Damn it!

23:16.792 --> 23:18.426
Betsy!

23:19.861 --> 23:21.262
Yes... sir?

23:21.263 --> 23:22.496
What is it?

23:22.497 --> 23:23.931
I've lost my car keys.

23:23.932 --> 23:25.566
I got a meeting off campus.

23:25.567 --> 23:27.568
What meeting?
I don't have one on my schedule.

23:27.569 --> 23:29.470
Betsy, could you please just help me here?

23:29.471 --> 23:31.138
(sighs)

23:33.707 --> 23:36.709
So, what would you like
me to do with your 5:00?

23:36.710 --> 23:39.112
- He's out in the lobby.
- Will you just...

23:39.113 --> 23:41.614
tell him we'll have
to reschedule. Thank you.

23:41.615 --> 23:43.197
Yeah, you could tell him that,

23:43.198 --> 23:45.318
but then you'd have to take
pretty much endless shit

23:45.319 --> 23:47.253
about how you're such a big shot now that

23:47.254 --> 23:50.322
you don't have time for
your old friends. Nice office.

23:50.323 --> 23:52.443
I'm going to the Pentagon.
You want to ride with me?

23:53.861 --> 23:55.394
So... Congressman.

23:55.395 --> 23:57.229
- Oh, don't even.
- Okay.

23:57.230 --> 23:58.598
Walden's future running mate.

23:58.599 --> 24:00.199
Possible running mate.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.234
Me and a hundred other guys.

24:02.235 --> 24:05.137
What can I do for you?

24:05.138 --> 24:06.638
It's about Walker.

24:06.639 --> 24:08.119
- Oh, God.
- The subcommittee report

24:08.120 --> 24:10.008
came out a couple weeks ago on his death.

24:10.009 --> 24:11.476
Read it?

24:11.477 --> 24:12.978
I avoided reading it.

24:12.979 --> 24:15.480
Well, maybe you should take a look.

24:15.481 --> 24:18.116
It says Walker was a lone sniper.

24:18.117 --> 24:19.618
Okay.

24:19.619 --> 24:23.053
No, no, not okay, it doesn't make sense.

24:23.054 --> 24:27.324
Look, Walker was the best shot
of any of us by far.

24:27.325 --> 24:29.565
- Mm-hmm.
- He wouldn't have missed the vice president.

24:29.566 --> 24:30.895
- Except he did.
- Three times.

24:30.896 --> 24:32.796
Only to land a
by-the-book kill shot

24:32.797 --> 24:35.533
on Elizabeth Gaines, some lady
who, as far as I can tell,

24:35.534 --> 24:37.501
doesn't even matter.

24:38.602 --> 24:41.270
You have to admit...

24:41.271 --> 24:42.739
the report doesn't make sense.

24:45.242 --> 24:47.877
So what does make sense?

24:47.878 --> 24:49.579
I don't know, but...

24:49.580 --> 24:51.060
Look, there's something more going on

24:51.061 --> 24:52.301
than just Walker and his rifle.

24:52.302 --> 24:54.416
So what are we talking here, a conspiracy?

24:54.417 --> 24:56.985
The Freemasons? The Illuminati?

24:56.986 --> 24:59.186
It's not just me Brody. All
the guys in the platoon...

24:59.187 --> 24:59.721
Which guys?

24:59.722 --> 25:01.522
All of them... Lauder...
we've been talking.

25:01.523 --> 25:03.659
Lauder, it's the alcohol talking.

25:03.660 --> 25:06.595
He's got a problem, I admit it.

25:08.998 --> 25:12.567
Look, forget about whether
Walker was in it alone or not,

25:12.568 --> 25:14.969
don't you even want to know
who fucking killed him?

25:14.970 --> 25:16.537
Because there's no answers in there,

25:16.538 --> 25:18.439
and no one seems to give a shit.

25:20.175 --> 25:22.142
You've got a clearance now.

25:22.143 --> 25:23.544
I'm just asking you to

25:23.545 --> 25:26.412
take look at the classified
stuff behind the report.

25:26.413 --> 25:27.914
What if there is no classified stuff

25:27.915 --> 25:30.283
- behind the report?
- Just check into it.

25:30.284 --> 25:31.952
Set our minds at ease.

25:33.487 --> 25:36.422
All right, maybe you're right.

25:36.423 --> 25:38.758
I'll make some calls.

25:38.759 --> 25:41.394
Thank you.

25:45.765 --> 25:47.405
The mission against Nazir and the husband

25:47.406 --> 25:48.701
is capture or kill,

25:48.702 --> 25:50.435
depending on how this goes on the ground.

25:50.436 --> 25:51.770
What about Saul and Carrie?

25:51.771 --> 25:53.973
They'll stay under wraps in the safe house

25:53.974 --> 25:56.274
until the action on
Hamra Street is underway.

25:56.275 --> 25:58.235
At that point they'll
have 15 minutes to pick up

25:58.236 --> 26:00.345
this informant and get her
to the extraction point.

26:00.346 --> 26:01.136
The beach?

26:01.137 --> 26:03.297
Yeah, everything goes right,
there'll be a helicopter

26:03.298 --> 26:04.498
waiting for the three of them.

26:04.499 --> 26:05.579
Everything better go right.

26:05.580 --> 26:07.020
That's what I promised the President

26:07.021 --> 26:08.661
to get him to green-light
the operation.

26:12.625 --> 26:14.791
GALVEZ: Satellite support
is up on monitor two.

26:14.792 --> 26:16.260
Thank you.

26:16.261 --> 26:17.595
That's it?

26:17.596 --> 26:19.597
GALVEZ:
Yes, sir. Hamra Street.

26:19.598 --> 26:21.898
Where the meeting with Nazir
is supposed to take place.

26:23.635 --> 26:25.315
That's our forward team position, Red One.

26:25.316 --> 26:26.604
They're on the ground,

26:26.605 --> 26:27.871
the mission is capture.

26:27.872 --> 26:29.006
Where are the snipers?

26:29.007 --> 26:31.007
The snipers are
Red Two. Please.

26:33.410 --> 26:37.247
These are the views from their scopes.

26:37.248 --> 26:38.615
Range is 400 yards.

26:38.616 --> 26:41.518
They'll take out Nazir
if the capture team fails.

26:41.519 --> 26:44.254
The snatch team has infiltrated
an empty office down the block.

26:44.255 --> 26:45.988
If Nazir shows up where he's supposed to...

26:45.989 --> 26:47.523
Less than two minutes.

26:55.998 --> 26:59.034
Why'd you stop calling, Saul?

26:59.035 --> 27:02.936
Dr. Rosenberg said
I reminded you of work.

27:02.937 --> 27:05.673
That was having a...

27:05.674 --> 27:09.443
deleterious effect on your prognosis.

27:11.280 --> 27:13.981
Yeah, that sounds like him.

27:15.984 --> 27:17.785
Ever think we'd be doing this again?

27:19.787 --> 27:23.523
I hoped.

27:26.859 --> 27:29.761
I know, I know.

27:29.762 --> 27:32.331
Don't get used to it.

27:32.332 --> 27:34.132
(chuckles)

27:34.133 --> 27:36.068
Okay, we're ready.

27:36.069 --> 27:37.509
JSOC and the Pentagon are looped in.

27:37.510 --> 27:39.238
Keep traffic to a minimum.

27:48.414 --> 27:49.714
- Hold on a second.
- Yes, sir.

27:49.715 --> 27:51.749
- Sorry for the wait.
- No, it's okay.

27:51.750 --> 27:53.618
Heard the secretary
of defense may have left.

27:53.619 --> 27:55.086
No, he's still here.

27:55.087 --> 27:57.554
There's something you'll want to see.

27:57.555 --> 28:00.424
Special Ops has an operation underway.

28:00.425 --> 28:03.159
Right now, in Beirut.

28:03.160 --> 28:05.161
You don't mean on the ground there?

28:05.162 --> 28:07.497
That's exactly what I mean.

28:07.498 --> 28:09.600
What is it?

28:09.601 --> 28:12.202
Either a major clusterfuck...

28:12.203 --> 28:14.503
or a big honking victory.

28:25.649 --> 28:27.416
Congressman.

28:27.417 --> 28:29.183
Here you go.

28:45.433 --> 28:47.801
Okay, there.
We've got movement

28:47.802 --> 28:49.035
Right on time.

29:01.047 --> 29:04.049
(shouts in foreign language)

29:14.461 --> 29:16.195
Why are they stopping there?

29:16.196 --> 29:17.962
All right, we've got six tangos

29:17.963 --> 29:19.498
west of target area.

29:19.499 --> 29:20.699
Roger, we see.

29:20.700 --> 29:22.000
(shouting in foreign language)

29:24.504 --> 29:26.004
Okay, we've got another vehicle.

29:26.005 --> 29:28.006
RYAN: Six more tangos,
east this time.

29:29.509 --> 29:30.776
They've got us pinned in.

29:30.777 --> 29:32.337
How could they know our guys are there?

29:32.338 --> 29:33.678
Because the informant fucked us.

29:33.679 --> 29:35.846
- Saul?
- Shh, quiet.

29:49.159 --> 29:50.993
RYAN:
Red One, stand by.

29:53.497 --> 29:55.832
RYAN:
We might be okay.

29:55.833 --> 29:57.434
They're just clearing the street.

29:59.403 --> 30:00.770
So they don't know we're there?

30:00.771 --> 30:03.172
No, no, but we're still way outnumbered.

30:03.173 --> 30:04.653
The capture team will never get Nazir

30:04.654 --> 30:06.809
out of there alive.

30:10.647 --> 30:12.448
Pull it, pull it.

30:12.449 --> 30:13.816
RYAN:
Abort capture.

30:13.817 --> 30:15.718
Red One, stand down.
Confirm.

30:15.719 --> 30:18.119
Red One is standing down.

30:20.856 --> 30:23.424
RYAN:
Red Two, stand by.

30:23.425 --> 30:25.059
Red Two standing by.

30:27.463 --> 30:30.064
What's going on?

30:30.065 --> 30:32.032
There's too many hostiles.

30:32.033 --> 30:33.801
They just switched the mission profile

30:33.802 --> 30:35.069
from capture to kill.

30:35.070 --> 30:36.337
Kill who?

30:36.338 --> 30:38.238
Who are they clearing the street for?

30:38.239 --> 30:40.039
Abu fucking Nazir, God willing.

30:41.342 --> 30:43.877
Yeah, I thought you'd be interested.

30:59.326 --> 31:00.960
We've got another vehicle.

31:00.961 --> 31:02.661
RYAN:
Red Team Two up.

31:02.662 --> 31:04.630
Two's up.

31:12.272 --> 31:14.239
SNIPER:
Counting two additional targets.

31:16.042 --> 31:18.122
- Confirm.
- That's Abbas, the informant's husband.

31:18.123 --> 31:20.879
Who's that with him?

31:20.880 --> 31:22.881
That's Al-Razi.
That's Nazir's lieutenant.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.002
We want to take 'em out now?

31:24.003 --> 31:25.216
No, they came together.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.737
They must be waiting for someone else.

31:26.738 --> 31:28.286
They must be.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.686
Sir, do you want to take 'em out?

31:29.687 --> 31:32.924
Wait, wait, wait, wait, just...

31:58.014 --> 32:00.316
RYAN:
Okay, heads up.

32:00.317 --> 32:01.717
Positions.
This will be it.

32:01.718 --> 32:03.686
Red Team Two, fire discipline

32:03.687 --> 32:05.955
is two shots each.
Targets are two in robes.

32:05.956 --> 32:07.990
RYAN:
Stand by for third.

32:38.419 --> 32:40.153
Holy shit, it's him.

32:44.158 --> 32:45.792
SNIPER:
Awaiting confirmation.

32:45.793 --> 32:47.927
RYAN:
Primary target is center.

32:49.396 --> 32:51.931
Sandman, fire.

32:51.932 --> 32:54.701
(gunshot)

32:54.702 --> 32:56.202
(yelling in foreign language)

32:56.203 --> 32:57.403
Carrie, Saul, we need to move.

32:57.404 --> 32:59.105
Please, we need to move!

32:59.106 --> 33:00.373
- What happened?
- Please!

33:00.374 --> 33:01.854
- Did they get him?
- Hurry, Carrie.

33:01.855 --> 33:03.174
We got to move it.
Let's go.

33:06.546 --> 33:09.548
WALDEN: What the fuck just happened?
We had him right in our sights.

33:17.023 --> 33:19.390
He turned around...
somebody warned him.

33:19.391 --> 33:22.359
The son of a bitch.
Get Estes on the phone

33:22.360 --> 33:23.360
right now.

33:30.569 --> 33:32.003
SAUL:
Yeah.

33:32.004 --> 33:33.470
We're almost to the pick up.

33:33.471 --> 33:35.038
I'll call when they're in the air.

33:35.039 --> 33:36.840
Two casualties, both on their side.

33:36.841 --> 33:39.081
Abbas and Al-Razi. Gunfire's
died down on Hamra Street,

33:39.082 --> 33:40.544
it looks like our guys made it out.

33:40.545 --> 33:42.242
- What about Abu Nazir?
- He got away.

33:42.243 --> 33:44.923
- Then we've got to loop back and find him.
- It's Hezbollah turf,

33:44.924 --> 33:46.564
we've only got four people on the ground.

33:46.565 --> 33:48.125
We're lucky they got out when they did.

33:48.126 --> 33:49.486
The important thing now is getting

33:49.487 --> 33:50.920
you and Fatima out of here.

33:52.188 --> 33:54.122
Hey, your source came through.

33:54.123 --> 33:56.224
You were right.

33:56.225 --> 33:59.294
I won't have you call this
anything but a victory.

34:29.690 --> 34:31.130
- Is anyone in the apartment?
- No.

34:31.132 --> 34:32.371
- Give me your keys.
- Carrie!

34:32.373 --> 34:34.053
We just missed Abu Nazir.
Get in the car.

34:34.054 --> 34:35.922
The man he was going to meet
lived in this building.

34:35.924 --> 34:36.563
Back in the car!

34:36.565 --> 34:38.445
We can't leave without
seeing what's in there.

34:38.446 --> 34:40.446
- Back in the car.
- Carrie, get back in the car.

34:40.447 --> 34:41.647
SAUL:
Carrie! Carrie! Carrie!

34:49.476 --> 34:51.110
(speaks in foreign language)

35:06.592 --> 35:08.593
(speaks in foreign language)

35:29.813 --> 35:33.315
(men shouting in foreign language)

35:44.326 --> 35:46.327
(men banging on car)

35:51.734 --> 35:53.902
(men shouting)

35:53.903 --> 35:57.205
FATIMA: - We should go. We should go.
- We wait. We wait!

35:57.206 --> 35:59.573
(distant, overlapping shouting)

36:05.180 --> 36:08.816
(sighs)

36:08.817 --> 36:11.018
We need to go.

36:11.019 --> 36:12.086
(shouting)

36:12.087 --> 36:14.520
Quick! Drive! Drive!

36:14.521 --> 36:15.789
SAUL:
Get out! Get out!

36:15.790 --> 36:17.557
Drive. Drive.

36:17.558 --> 36:20.226
(tires squealing, engine revving)

36:21.228 --> 36:23.863
(panting)

36:25.532 --> 36:27.266
(speaking foreign language)

36:31.705 --> 36:33.371
(distant shout)

36:33.372 --> 36:36.175
(gunfire)

36:36.176 --> 36:37.876
(shouting in foreign language)

36:37.877 --> 36:40.079
(yelps)

36:40.080 --> 36:42.848
(men shouting)

36:42.849 --> 36:44.850
(speaking foreign language)

36:45.852 --> 36:48.220
(panting)

36:52.891 --> 36:55.193
(panting)

36:58.297 --> 37:00.732
(rumbling footsteps)

37:00.733 --> 37:01.999
(speaking foreign language)

37:02.000 --> 37:03.400
(gunfire)

37:03.401 --> 37:05.469
(gasps)

37:05.470 --> 37:07.404
(panting, overlapping chatter of men)

37:13.411 --> 37:15.412
(sighs)

37:21.985 --> 37:24.254
(panting)

37:25.255 --> 37:27.422
(panting)

37:29.392 --> 37:31.426
(Carrie groans, man grunts)

37:31.427 --> 37:32.661
(panting)

37:34.397 --> 37:36.632
(man shouting)

37:36.633 --> 37:38.801
Carrie.
(gasps)

37:38.802 --> 37:41.236
I got you. Follow me.

37:42.938 --> 37:44.272
(distant shout)

37:50.379 --> 37:53.181
There! Now!

37:53.182 --> 37:54.649
(tires screeching)

37:54.650 --> 37:57.151
What the fuck, Carrie?
What the fuck?!

37:57.152 --> 37:59.719
Out of here.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.855
Are you okay?
(tires squealing)

38:04.325 --> 38:05.759
(panting)

38:05.760 --> 38:08.762
(sighs)

38:36.789 --> 38:39.991
Nazir sends his gratitude.

38:39.992 --> 38:41.626
How did they know?

38:41.627 --> 38:43.061
An informant.

38:43.062 --> 38:45.262
We think it was Abbas's second wife.

38:45.263 --> 38:47.064
I'm a congressman.

38:47.065 --> 38:48.732
You get that, right?

38:48.733 --> 38:50.201
A U.S. congressman.

38:50.202 --> 38:52.602
I cannot be texting secret messages

38:52.603 --> 38:55.439
while I am surrounded by
the fucking Joint Chiefs!

38:55.440 --> 38:56.941
I know it's been difficult.

38:56.942 --> 38:59.310
(scoffs)

39:01.712 --> 39:03.679
I'm not your guy.

39:03.680 --> 39:05.481
We just took a hit.

39:05.482 --> 39:07.851
We lost two in Beirut.

39:07.852 --> 39:10.320
Your role is more important than ever now.

39:10.321 --> 39:13.323
I've done my role.

39:13.324 --> 39:15.524
(breathing loudly)

39:15.525 --> 39:17.960
He needs you.

39:21.231 --> 39:23.598
I'll stay in touch.

39:29.172 --> 39:32.140
(car door closes, engine starts)

39:40.283 --> 39:42.683
(rock music plays quietly in
the background, crowd chatter)

39:52.593 --> 39:55.262
(sighs heavily)

39:59.575 --> 40:01.935
LAUDER: I want you to stand
right here when you come back.

40:01.936 --> 40:03.370
The honorable

40:03.371 --> 40:05.170
Nicholas Brody!

40:05.171 --> 40:06.238
Just calm down, okay?

40:06.239 --> 40:07.639
Hey, I'm happy to see him.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.141
He's my congressman.

40:09.142 --> 40:10.409
You vote for me, Lauder?

40:10.410 --> 40:12.378
Next time.

40:12.379 --> 40:15.948
Being I'm so impressed with
your constituent services.

40:15.949 --> 40:17.883
So... what did you find?

40:17.884 --> 40:19.451
(sighs)

40:19.452 --> 40:21.786
They don't know who killed Walker.

40:21.787 --> 40:23.754
And there's nothing in
the classified materials

40:23.755 --> 40:25.390
that sheds any light on it.

40:25.391 --> 40:26.791
But you looked?

40:26.792 --> 40:29.127
I told Mike I'd make some calls, and I did.

40:29.128 --> 40:33.264
Well, gentlemen, am I fucking
clairvoyant or what?

40:33.265 --> 40:35.433
- Okay, enough, enough.
- I said... I said

40:35.434 --> 40:38.635
this guy was going
to come in with jack shit,

40:38.636 --> 40:40.904
which is exactly what he's done.

40:40.905 --> 40:41.972
What do you want?

40:41.973 --> 40:43.320
I want to see you

40:43.321 --> 40:44.841
flex some goddamn congressional muscle

40:44.842 --> 40:46.810
and get to the bottom of this thing.

40:46.811 --> 40:48.771
There's nothing to get
to the bottom of, Lauder.

40:48.772 --> 40:50.847
No? What about Walker

40:50.848 --> 40:53.549
never missing a shot in his entire life,

40:53.550 --> 40:56.385
and that day, suddenly missing three?

40:56.386 --> 40:58.387
What about that whole fucking gavotte

40:58.388 --> 41:00.323
on the steps of the State Department

41:00.324 --> 41:02.291
being a damn distraction...
For what?!

41:02.292 --> 41:03.854
Nothing else happened.

41:03.855 --> 41:06.015
If that was the distraction,
what was the main event?

41:06.016 --> 41:07.336
That's what we were stupid enough

41:07.337 --> 41:08.817
to think that we'd find out from you!

41:08.818 --> 41:10.458
MIKE: All right.
All right, both of you.

41:10.459 --> 41:12.267
Settle down.

41:15.338 --> 41:17.939
Walker is dead.

41:17.940 --> 41:19.074
That's right.

41:19.075 --> 41:20.942
A brother marine.

41:20.943 --> 41:23.644
And it is fucking unbecoming,

41:23.645 --> 41:26.280
your lack of interest
in the truth of his demise.

41:26.281 --> 41:28.682
You want the truth?

41:28.683 --> 41:31.051
Walker broke.

41:31.052 --> 41:32.752
He gave up everybody's position

41:32.753 --> 41:34.221
including yours, all of you here.

41:34.222 --> 41:36.156
I was there.
I heard it.

41:36.157 --> 41:40.727
And I know you're all waiting
for some other explanation

41:40.728 --> 41:43.662
that somehow keeps Walker the guy you knew,

41:43.663 --> 41:47.333
but the fact is, Walker is not
the person you think he is.

41:47.334 --> 41:50.203
He stopped being a marine
the day he turned traitor.

41:54.208 --> 41:57.976
Walker may have lost his mind,
but he did not lose his aim.

41:57.977 --> 42:00.112
- That's...
- Shut up, Lauder. Just shut up.

42:11.124 --> 42:12.690
(lock clicks)

42:22.034 --> 42:25.836
(sighs)

42:40.117 --> 42:42.952
Hey. It's getting late.

42:42.953 --> 42:44.554
Lights out soon, huh?

42:44.555 --> 42:46.188
Yeah, in a minute.

42:47.790 --> 42:49.824
Oh.

42:49.825 --> 42:53.028
By the way, um, mom is going
to ask you to speak

42:53.029 --> 42:55.797
at this fund-raiser thing, and
she's pretty serious about it,

42:55.798 --> 42:58.600
so... I'd say yes if I were you.

42:58.601 --> 43:00.835
Thanks for the heads-up.

43:03.305 --> 43:05.639
Who are you talking to?

43:07.876 --> 43:09.277
No. You're right.

43:09.278 --> 43:10.711
It's none of my business.

43:10.712 --> 43:13.614
No, it's okay. It's just...

43:13.615 --> 43:16.250
after everything that happened in school,

43:16.251 --> 43:19.086
you're not going to believe it, but, um...

43:19.087 --> 43:22.789
Finn Walden.

43:22.790 --> 43:24.591
The moron?

43:24.592 --> 43:26.493
No.

43:26.494 --> 43:29.796
Okay, I guess I was wrong about him.

43:29.797 --> 43:33.165
I made a mistake.

43:35.001 --> 43:37.636
It happens.

43:39.206 --> 43:41.807
You okay?

43:41.808 --> 43:43.576
Yeah.

43:43.577 --> 43:45.744
Good night, sweetheart.

44:12.537 --> 44:14.838
Well...

44:14.839 --> 44:17.774
must be a relief to be home.

44:17.775 --> 44:20.110
Sure.

44:20.111 --> 44:21.777
I mean, yeah.

44:21.778 --> 44:23.479
I know you must have heard this

44:23.480 --> 44:26.482
from everyone and their brother,
but thank you.

44:36.026 --> 44:38.627
(sighs)

44:41.464 --> 44:43.865
A beautiful house, by the way.

44:43.866 --> 44:46.000
Ah, it's not mine.

44:46.001 --> 44:48.370
Take care.

45:00.182 --> 45:02.249
(door creaks open)

45:02.250 --> 45:04.585
(keys jingling)

45:11.225 --> 45:13.226
(clock ticking)

45:21.968 --> 45:24.136
(clock chiming)

45:24.137 --> 45:26.538
(sighs)

45:38.718 --> 45:41.086
(sighs)

45:43.088 --> 45:45.089
(seagulls cawing)

45:46.525 --> 45:48.892
SAUL: - Anything?
- Nothing.

45:48.893 --> 45:50.928
I have some names and addresses,

45:50.929 --> 45:53.431
but nothing seems to be of any importance.

45:53.432 --> 45:55.433
I think it's just the wife's junk.

45:55.434 --> 45:58.468
Let's ship it off to Langley,
see what they can find.

45:58.469 --> 46:01.638
(keyboard keys clicking)

46:01.639 --> 46:03.306
You look exhausted.

46:03.307 --> 46:05.508
Get some rest.

46:05.509 --> 46:07.910
I'll pack it up.

46:15.084 --> 46:17.486
(sighs)

46:46.914 --> 46:49.283
(sighs)

47:02.996 --> 47:06.064
My name is Nicholas Brody,

47:06.065 --> 47:09.568
and I'm a sergeant in
the United States Marine Corps.

47:09.569 --> 47:11.970
I have a wife

47:11.971 --> 47:14.940
and two kids...

47:14.941 --> 47:17.942
who I love.

47:17.943 --> 47:20.345
(sighs)

47:20.346 --> 47:22.380
By the time you've watched this,

47:22.381 --> 47:24.916
you'll have read a lot of things about me.

47:27.151 --> 47:29.252
About what I've done.

47:31.122 --> 47:33.524
That's why I wanted to explain myself.

47:35.993 --> 47:38.329
So that you'll know the truth.
