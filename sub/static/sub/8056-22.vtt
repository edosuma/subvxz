WEBVTT

00:01.267 --> 00:04.146
I will certify the results after
all the precincts have reported.

00:04.204 --> 00:06.115
A final tally
within 1%

00:06.239 --> 00:08.150
will trigger
an automatic recount.

00:08.208 --> 00:11.883
In the event of an exact tie, the seat
is awarded to the male candidate,

00:11.945 --> 00:14.016
and the female candidate
is put in jail.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.559
Once again,
I have to object.

00:15.615 --> 00:19.188
I don't think it would hold up
in court but it is city law.

00:19.252 --> 00:21.061
Any questions?
Yes, actually.

00:21.221 --> 00:23.428
At the eleventh hour,
the Newports

00:23.556 --> 00:25.763
are trying to install
these voting machines

00:25.825 --> 00:27.566
in several
precincts around town.

00:27.827 --> 00:30.307
Watch what happens when I
vote for Bobby Newport.

00:36.403 --> 00:38.610
Shouldn't we be rewarding
our citizens for voting?

00:38.671 --> 00:40.947
I'm never against
anyone getting a candy bar.

00:41.007 --> 00:43.180
But watch what happens
when you vote for me.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.318
Then, you have to
press it again.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.994
I'm sorry. I just don't
see the problem.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:20.213 --> 01:23.456
Bobby Newport and I are separated
by a razor-thin margin.

01:23.516 --> 01:24.893
Could go either way.

01:24.951 --> 01:27.397
I've only slept nine hours
over the past four days.

01:27.454 --> 01:29.934
So, I'm right on the verge
of a nervous breakdown.

01:31.524 --> 01:32.525
This isn't a bagel.

01:32.725 --> 01:33.863
Party starts at 7:00

01:33.927 --> 01:37.875
in the historic Jermaine Jackson
Ballroom at the Pawnee SuperSuites.

01:38.264 --> 01:42.735
It is no longer a "Pimps
and Hoes" pajama party.

01:43.002 --> 01:46.142
That idea was
nixed by a certain

01:46.272 --> 01:49.412
uptight nerd who
shall remain nameless.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.885
By 10:00, we should know
if Leslie won the election.

01:51.945 --> 01:56.360
But more importantly, tonight, Ann
and I are getting back together.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.755
Oh, right. Because
of a dream you had?

01:58.818 --> 02:00.661
Last night,
at approximately 2:30 a.m.,

02:00.720 --> 02:02.666
I woke up from a dream
that felt so real

02:02.789 --> 02:04.735
that it had
to be a premonition.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.168
Me, Drake,
and the T-Mobile girl

02:06.259 --> 02:08.398
were playing
baccarat on a private jet.

02:08.661 --> 02:11.198
Ann Perkins walks up
to me, and she says,

02:11.531 --> 02:14.273
"Tommy, tomorrow night,
I'm taking you back."

02:15.401 --> 02:18.382
Then, Blue Ivy Carter high-fived
me and gave me $40 million.

02:19.572 --> 02:21.609
It was all so real.

02:22.709 --> 02:24.746
The reason why Bobby and I
are appearing together

02:24.811 --> 02:27.485
is to send the message that
everyone should get out and vote,

02:27.547 --> 02:28.924
no matter who
they're voting for.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.462
That's right. Another
awesome point by Leslie.

02:31.518 --> 02:32.519
That's why
I'm voting for you.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.493
What's so funny?

02:36.623 --> 02:37.795
They were laughing
at your joke.

02:37.857 --> 02:39.336
What joke?
I am voting for you.

02:40.460 --> 02:41.461
You're not
voting for yourself?

02:42.228 --> 02:43.730
Leslie, you can't
vote for yourself,

02:43.796 --> 02:45.503
I don't think. I'm pretty
sure that's illegal.

02:46.933 --> 02:47.968
Anything else?

02:48.034 --> 02:49.843
Bobby, if you won, what
would be your first thing...

02:49.903 --> 02:53.077
Hey. You did an unbelievable
job on this campaign, Ben.

02:53.306 --> 02:55.183
My partners back in
Washington think so, too.

02:55.241 --> 02:57.084
Well, Leslie gets
the credit, not me.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.625
Look. Your opponent
is legendarily stupid,

03:00.747 --> 03:02.749
and I phoned it
in pretty hard.

03:02.815 --> 03:03.816
But you have
a knack for this.

03:04.417 --> 03:06.192
I'm running Congressman
Murray's re-election bid.

03:06.252 --> 03:07.993
Ohio 19.

03:08.054 --> 03:09.658
I need someone to
coordinate out of D.C.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.763
You want to do it?

03:12.392 --> 03:14.872
Yeah. That sounds great,
but the Pacers called,

03:14.961 --> 03:16.634
and they're asking me to be
their starting point guard.

03:16.963 --> 03:17.964
I'm being serious, Ben.

03:18.498 --> 03:23.243
What? What, you'd trust me
with a congressional campaign?

03:23.536 --> 03:24.537
Is this a trick?

03:24.871 --> 03:26.282
No, this is
a job offer.

03:26.773 --> 03:29.185
Give me your answer soon. I'd need
you in Washington in two days.

03:32.845 --> 03:35.792
Look at that. Look at that thing.
What is that?

03:36.583 --> 03:37.584
Don't touch it.

03:39.018 --> 03:41.464
Ann Perkins. Can I ask
your advice on something?

03:41.521 --> 03:42.522
Sure.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.398
Recently, in a moment
of weakness, I had sex

03:44.457 --> 03:47.097
with Bobby Newport's campaign
manager, Jennifer Barkley.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.537
Seriously?
Yes, several times.

03:50.029 --> 03:51.337
And then,
several more times.

03:51.464 --> 03:53.341
And then
a couple more times.

03:54.267 --> 03:55.302
And then
one more time.

03:55.435 --> 03:56.971
How long has
this been going on?

03:57.036 --> 03:58.037
Oh, It's just
last night.

03:58.371 --> 04:01.750
Now, I know that it's a one night
stand, and that she's leaving town.

04:01.808 --> 04:05.881
But our ferocious sexual decathlon
did radically improve my mood,

04:05.945 --> 04:08.687
and I'd kind of like to see
her again before she leaves.

04:09.148 --> 04:11.025
Good idea? Bad idea?

04:11.784 --> 04:14.492
I don't know. I guess
the campaign is over.

04:15.121 --> 04:16.464
So, I suppose
it couldn't hurt.

04:17.055 --> 04:18.091
Ann Perkins.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.903
April?
Got your message!

04:24.230 --> 04:26.107
Where are you?
Under the table.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.812
Why are you hiding?

04:29.769 --> 04:31.646
Should I hide, too?
Babe, what's going on?

04:31.704 --> 04:34.241
I was supposed to copy all the
department files onto a thumb drive,

04:34.307 --> 04:35.513
and it kept freezing
and I got annoyed

04:35.642 --> 04:36.848
and I don't know
what happened,

04:36.909 --> 04:38.616
but all of the files
are gone.

04:38.678 --> 04:39.748
On every computer.

04:39.812 --> 04:41.291
They're all gone.
Babe, they're all gone.

04:41.347 --> 04:42.382
Okay. Okay,
calm down.

04:42.882 --> 04:45.795
First of all, you did the right
thing by hiding under this table.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.323
Secondly,
your man is here.

04:48.688 --> 04:50.224
I'm going to take
care of this for us.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.500
I've been
playing Xbox for years.

04:53.259 --> 04:56.638
I'm really good at fixing it when it freezes.
I know exactly what to do.

05:03.336 --> 05:04.337
Try it now.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.379
I don't know. I feel like
I'm forgetting something.

05:07.674 --> 05:08.675
What about my speeches?

05:08.775 --> 05:09.776
Finished both of
them last night.

05:09.842 --> 05:11.344
One if you win,
one if you lose.

05:11.411 --> 05:12.515
What if I tie?

05:12.612 --> 05:13.955
You need to write
a tie speech for me.

05:14.013 --> 05:16.425
Something about the poetic
nature of democracy,

05:16.482 --> 05:18.189
and how I'm going to fight this
thing from my prison cell.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.662
Leslie, relax.
We're done.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.790
All that's left is the waiting.
Okay?

05:22.555 --> 05:23.795
What were you
talking to Jen about?

05:25.191 --> 05:26.932
Oh, nothing.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.666
No, I just...
Nothing.

05:28.728 --> 05:32.005
She... She's... Nothing.
Nothing. It's nothing.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.942
Hey, what's a good
place to buy jeans?

05:34.033 --> 05:35.944
You have plenty of jeans.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.913
What were you talking about?
Okay.

05:38.438 --> 05:41.908
Jen offered me a job working
on a congressional campaign.

05:41.974 --> 05:43.146
Oh, my God.
That's amazing.

05:43.209 --> 05:44.313
In Washington.

05:44.377 --> 05:45.856
What?

05:45.912 --> 05:47.050
Are you happy or angry?

05:48.448 --> 05:52.624
I don't know. I don't know. What did you say?
Did you say yes?

05:52.685 --> 05:54.096
I haven't had
a chance to think about it.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.064
I mean,
it sounds amazing.

05:56.122 --> 05:59.126
But you know, six months
in Washington, D.C.

06:00.059 --> 06:01.367
away from you.

06:01.594 --> 06:02.937
But we should
talk about it.

06:02.995 --> 06:04.997
Yeah, we'll just talk about it.
We'll mull it over.

06:05.064 --> 06:07.101
We'll look at it
from every side,

06:07.233 --> 06:09.270
et cetera, et cetera.
I'm going to go vote.

06:09.335 --> 06:10.837
Just fulfill
a lifelong dream of mine

06:10.903 --> 06:13.349
and achieve one of my all-time
happiest moments real quick.

06:13.406 --> 06:15.010
And then we will talk about it.

06:15.675 --> 06:16.676
Cool.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.565
Leslie, I can't figure this thing out.
Can you help me?

06:36.629 --> 06:38.233
Yeah. Just hang on
a second, Bobby.

06:38.498 --> 06:41.945
I got ink all over my hands, and
the pen thingy came off the chain.

06:42.835 --> 06:44.405
I don't get it.

06:49.175 --> 06:50.620
The polls have
just closed,

06:50.676 --> 06:53.020
and now, we're getting results
in the race for City Council.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.385
With just 1% of the
precincts reporting,

06:55.448 --> 06:58.657
adult film star, Brandi Maxxxx,
has a commanding lead.

06:58.718 --> 07:00.925
Oh, my God. That's it.
It's not Bobby Newport

07:00.987 --> 07:02.557
who's going to beat me.
It's Brandi Maxxxx.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.465
The porn star.
What is this, Italy?

07:04.524 --> 07:06.868
Listen, I know you're stressed out.
And I figured you would be,

07:06.926 --> 07:10.066
so I took the liberty of arranging
a fun little activity for us.

07:10.129 --> 07:12.632
You did?
Ann, thank you so much.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.277
I've said this to you before, and I
know it makes you uncomfortable.

07:15.334 --> 07:17.575
Oh, boy. But you're thoughtful
and you're brilliant,

07:17.637 --> 07:19.207
and your
ambiguous ethnic blend

07:19.272 --> 07:21.718
perfectly represents the dream
of the American melting pot.

07:22.942 --> 07:23.943
Okay, let's go.
Okay.

07:27.346 --> 07:29.485
Another, Dana.
Please and thank you.

07:29.549 --> 07:32.223
Ron? I handed out
1,000 leaflets today.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.060
That is a personal best.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.259
Now, I'm off to vote.
The polls are closed.

07:36.923 --> 07:39.062
What? No, no, no. I thought
that they closed at 8:00.

07:39.692 --> 07:40.693
6:00.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.703
Oh, my God. Ron, I didn't
get to vote for Leslie.

07:44.764 --> 07:46.004
Oh, my God.
What do I do?

07:46.065 --> 07:47.772
Nothing you can do.
Except hope

07:47.900 --> 07:49.641
Leslie doesn't
lose by one vote.

07:49.702 --> 07:52.182
9% of precincts reporting,

07:52.238 --> 07:55.048
and it's razor-thin.
And getting razor-thinner.

07:55.508 --> 07:56.851
Oh, boy.

07:56.909 --> 07:58.013
No. No.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.248
Jen Barkley.

08:00.079 --> 08:06.121
Hey. What are you doing here? That was
fun last night, you little screamer.

08:06.185 --> 08:08.426
There were moments that
I didn't fully understand

08:08.488 --> 08:10.092
some of the physical shapes
that we were making.

08:10.923 --> 08:12.630
But the sensations
were amazing.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.330
So, I just went with it.
Great.

08:14.393 --> 08:16.771
Well, I thought that we could
just talk before you left town.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.103
If that's okay.
O.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.802
But there's a supply room
over there with a futon.

08:19.866 --> 08:20.901
Great.

08:21.968 --> 08:23.276
Not yet. Just wait.

08:23.936 --> 08:26.416
We're just getting supplies.
Anybody need anything?

08:26.472 --> 08:27.473
Push pins, or...
Okay, great.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.144
Please hurry.

08:30.076 --> 08:31.453
I told her it's a matter
of life and death.

08:31.577 --> 08:32.988
Honey, Donna's been
here forever.

08:33.044 --> 08:34.717
She's going to know what to do.
What if she doesn't?

08:35.280 --> 08:36.760
I could get fired.

08:36.816 --> 08:38.318
Or even worse,
Leslie might give me

08:38.451 --> 08:39.986
a lecture on
responsibility again.

08:40.052 --> 08:41.053
I can't do it.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.397
I'll tell you what, honey. Here's the deal.
You get fired,

08:44.457 --> 08:45.959
I'll quit, and we'll
leave together.

08:46.225 --> 08:48.967
I'm serious. Move to a new
city, change our names,

08:49.028 --> 08:51.668
burn our fingertips
off with acid,

08:51.731 --> 08:53.267
swap faces.
What?

08:53.332 --> 08:54.640
If we have to.

08:55.234 --> 08:57.942
Good. Yes. Nice.
Keep punching.

08:58.571 --> 08:59.879
Did I hit your boob? Sorry. No.

09:00.706 --> 09:01.810
Great form.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.649
Maybe. I have no
idea, actually.

09:03.709 --> 09:04.779
I don't know
what I'm doing.

09:04.844 --> 09:07.950
Yeah! That was good. I'm exhausted.
How long was that?

09:08.014 --> 09:09.220
Twenty-two
seconds.

09:09.982 --> 09:11.222
Boy, that's
disappointing.

09:11.350 --> 09:12.590
What are you
going to do about Ben?

09:13.319 --> 09:16.630
I've been running for office the
entire time we've been dating.

09:16.689 --> 09:19.169
We're just about to
get our lives back.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.704
It would kill me
if he left.

09:20.760 --> 09:24.367
Then tell him that. Go find him
and tell him how you feel.

09:24.430 --> 09:26.967
And then the two of you can work
it out together.

09:29.035 --> 09:31.037
Election results,
Ann. Ann.

09:31.103 --> 09:32.377
Ann, I can't read it.
Okay.

09:32.438 --> 09:33.576
Ann, my hands.
Don't panic. Here.

09:33.639 --> 09:35.710
My hands, Ann. They're
in these round gloves.

09:35.775 --> 09:38.085
Okay. "20% of the
precincts reporting.

09:38.144 --> 09:40.249
"Bobby Newport is
up by 140 votes."

09:41.647 --> 09:43.786
Okay. Let's get your hands back up.
Okay.

09:43.849 --> 09:44.919
Let's go another eight seconds.

09:46.552 --> 09:47.758
Oh, God,
I'm so tired.

09:48.921 --> 09:49.991
Gin and tonic, please.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.127
Belay that order, Dana.

09:52.458 --> 09:57.066
Lagavulin, neat. Clear alcohols
are for rich women on diets.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.005
What's on
your mind, son?

10:01.534 --> 10:05.914
Well, Jen Barkley offered me
a job in Washington.

10:06.172 --> 10:07.549
A great job.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.678
But I think Leslie
wants me to stay.

10:11.210 --> 10:12.484
What would you do?

10:12.878 --> 10:17.190
Well, I've never been one for meeting
new people or doing new things

10:17.450 --> 10:22.365
or eating new types of food or
traveling outside of Southern Indiana.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.102
I've had the same
haircut since 1978,

10:25.224 --> 10:27.727
and I've driven
the same car since 1991.

10:28.094 --> 10:30.938
I've used the same wooden
comb for three decades.

10:32.098 --> 10:33.475
I have one bowl.

10:33.532 --> 10:35.671
I still get my milk
delivered by horse.

10:35.735 --> 10:36.907
You do?

10:36.969 --> 10:39.006
But you and Leslie
like to hold hands

10:39.138 --> 10:41.209
and jump off of
cliffs together,

10:41.273 --> 10:42.775
into the
great unknown.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.455
You two have
a good relationship.

10:48.748 --> 10:50.955
I don't personally
know what that's like,

10:51.017 --> 10:54.965
but I'm given to understand it means
you're going to land on your feet.

10:55.855 --> 10:59.769
So, you really want things
to just stay exactly the same.

11:01.093 --> 11:04.939
But if Leslie wins, you get my old job.
Assistant City Manager, right?

11:05.331 --> 11:07.140
Seems that way.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.109
Then good luck,
to the both of us.

11:14.206 --> 11:15.207
Hey!

11:18.344 --> 11:20.984
I have an update
that contains new information.

11:21.247 --> 11:23.921
With 74% of
the precincts reporting,

11:23.983 --> 11:27.362
Leslie Knope is now
winning by 192 votes.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.331
Thank God. Oh, Lord, please, please, let her win.
Please let her win.

11:31.390 --> 11:32.391
Please let her win
Please let her win.

11:33.492 --> 11:34.493
I'm going to
just say this.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.973
And I realized
this after speaking

11:37.096 --> 11:39.042
with my best friend
and relationship advisor,

11:39.098 --> 11:40.441
Ann Perkins, from
the Department of Health.

11:40.499 --> 11:42.137
Yes, I know Ann.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.839
I don't want you
to go to Washington.

11:44.470 --> 11:45.972
I know it's
an amazing opportunity.

11:46.038 --> 11:49.679
But in just a few minutes, all
this craziness is going to be over

11:50.976 --> 11:52.455
and I just want to
have dinner with you.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.585
Like normal people.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.954
Yeah.
Then, I won't go.

11:56.949 --> 11:58.223
Really?
Yeah.

11:58.284 --> 12:00.890
Easy. I mean, I was on the
fence about it anyway.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.931
I mean, Washington
is really far away,

12:03.055 --> 12:05.001
and I don't know if I
want to work with Jen.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.798
I mean, this just
seals the deal. I'll stay.

12:07.626 --> 12:10.368
Thank God.
What a relief.

12:11.464 --> 12:12.465
Guys.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.213
It's been neck-and-neck.
Too close to call all night.

12:16.268 --> 12:19.374
But now, we're ready to make a
call in the race for City Council.

12:19.705 --> 12:20.706
Bobby Newport...
Oh, no.

12:20.773 --> 12:24.983
...scion of the Sweetums candy
empire and amateur go-kart champion,

12:25.077 --> 12:26.385
has won the race.

12:29.115 --> 12:30.321
Why are you laughing?

12:30.449 --> 12:31.689
Because my dream
is dead.

12:34.153 --> 12:36.759
Oh, oh,

12:40.292 --> 12:41.600
Recount.
There's a recount.

12:41.660 --> 12:44.470
Oh, come on.
It's over. Just concede.

12:44.563 --> 12:47.772
Newport won by 21 votes. That's well
within the margin for a recount.

12:47.867 --> 12:48.902
Please don't do this.

12:49.101 --> 12:51.240
I really want to get out of here.
How about this?

12:51.704 --> 12:52.705
Why don't I make
you guys a deal?

12:52.772 --> 12:54.809
Okay, there's no deal in the world
that we would ever possibly...

12:54.874 --> 12:56.478
I'll give you Joe Biden's
home phone number.

12:56.542 --> 12:57.885
Now, hang on.
That's interesting.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.013
No, honey, you're not
thinking clearly.

12:59.078 --> 13:02.855
Mr. Commissioner, the recount has
to start immediately. It's the law.

13:02.915 --> 13:04.622
And I'm not leaving
until you make the call.

13:05.050 --> 13:08.122
He's right, Ms. Barkley. It will start right away.
Keep your phones on.

13:08.187 --> 13:09.188
Terrence!

13:10.289 --> 13:11.734
I just want to
go home.

13:13.659 --> 13:14.660
Hey. Any news?

13:14.727 --> 13:17.298
They said the recount could
take two hours, but who knows?

13:17.363 --> 13:18.842
Man, this is stressful.
I picked

13:18.964 --> 13:20.443
the wrong week to
do a juice cleanse.

13:20.499 --> 13:23.002
Okay. I think Leslie should
say something to the troops,

13:23.068 --> 13:24.274
just to get
everyone's spirits up.

13:24.336 --> 13:25.508
Where is she?
I don't know.

13:25.571 --> 13:26.811
She's not
answering her phone.

13:28.607 --> 13:30.245
What, no one knows
where she is?

13:37.049 --> 13:39.825
That's a nice chair.
Corinthian leather.

13:39.885 --> 13:42.365
Solid mahogany frame with,
what I believe,

13:42.488 --> 13:44.968
are hand-cut
mortise and tenon joints.

13:45.024 --> 13:46.059
Pinned with oak.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.599
I was really looking
forward to sitting in it.

13:48.694 --> 13:50.435
I figured this
might be my last chance.

13:51.063 --> 13:52.235
You don't know that.

13:52.398 --> 13:55.743
Ron, for the last six months,
my friends have worked so hard.

13:56.302 --> 13:58.145
Every five-minute
coffee-break at work.

13:58.504 --> 14:02.281
Every night, every weekend, every
spare moment of their lives,

14:02.408 --> 14:03.409
they gave to me.

14:03.776 --> 14:06.484
If I lose,
I'll never forgive myself.

14:07.913 --> 14:09.483
You deserve to win.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.353
We didn't volunteer
to help you

14:12.418 --> 14:15.831
because we wanted to wrap
ourselves in personal glory.

14:15.921 --> 14:19.960
We did it because
we care about you.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.466
You had a dream, and we
wanted to support your dream.

14:24.196 --> 14:27.040
That's what you do when
you care about someone.

14:27.099 --> 14:29.136
You support them.
Win, lose, or draw.

14:30.469 --> 14:34.474
Let's go back to the party. You drive.
I've had 11 whiskeys.

14:35.541 --> 14:39.648
Okay. That's good on places to live.
Let's go back to dream jobs.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.782
If we have to start
a new life, I have,

14:41.847 --> 14:44.953
"Detective, F.B.l. agent,
policeman, C.l.A. agent."

14:45.017 --> 14:46.519
So, we need more for you.
Let's go.

14:46.585 --> 14:47.859
And}!-

14:47.987 --> 14:49.261
It's fun.
I'm trying to help you

14:49.321 --> 14:52.200
take your mind off of this
horrible mistake you made,

14:52.258 --> 14:53.737
deleting
all these files.

14:54.126 --> 14:56.766
Probably the worst thing that ever
happened in Parks and Rec: history.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.240
Oh, my God. You'll most
certainly get fired.

14:58.297 --> 15:00.174
And I'm trying to help.
My God.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.803
So, dream jobs.
Go. Dream big, kid!

15:02.868 --> 15:06.611
Fine. A dental hygienist
who's also a medium,

15:06.672 --> 15:09.346
so I can clean people's teeth and
tell them when they're going to die.

15:09.942 --> 15:11.012
That's brilliant.

15:11.143 --> 15:12.247
Let's make this fast.

15:12.311 --> 15:14.655
I almost made it with Councilman
Howser before you interrupted us.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.081
Which files
did you delete?

15:16.215 --> 15:17.216
All of them.

15:17.283 --> 15:18.694
I just put this
stupid flash drive in,

15:18.817 --> 15:20.125
and then I tried to
drag everything over...

15:20.185 --> 15:21.186
Fixed it.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.664
What?
What? How?

15:22.721 --> 15:24.997
Jerry accidentally deletes
things all the time.

15:25.057 --> 15:27.059
Ten years ago, I installed
my own secret backup.

15:27.826 --> 15:29.169
You saved us,
Donna.

15:29.228 --> 15:30.229
I love you.

15:30.362 --> 15:32.137
Okay. Bring it in, boy.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.644
There you are.
Thank God.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.648
We're going to get
the final results any minute.

15:38.704 --> 15:41.048
I know. Do you have
both my speeches?

15:41.840 --> 15:45.253
Yes. You seem calmer
than I expected you'd be.

15:45.311 --> 15:46.312
I got you something.

15:48.213 --> 15:49.487
Let me open it
for you.

15:55.387 --> 15:56.832
You have to
go to Washington.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.531
I told you
I'm turning it down.

15:59.591 --> 16:04.131
I was being selfish. You put
your whole life on hold for me.

16:04.196 --> 16:07.575
The very least I can do is
try to return the favor.

16:08.701 --> 16:09.839
Are you sure
about this?

16:09.902 --> 16:11.142
We can make it work.

16:11.870 --> 16:15.511
I'll go visit you, then you come
visit me, then I go visit you again,

16:15.574 --> 16:17.952
and then we make out
in the Lincoln Bedroom

16:18.010 --> 16:20.183
and the
Jefferson Memorial

16:20.245 --> 16:23.226
and the Supreme Court Gallery.
We'll do it all over Washington.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.084
Thank you.

16:27.886 --> 16:30.264
Where did you get a
Washington Monument figurine

16:30.322 --> 16:31.926
at midnight
on a Tuesday?

16:32.858 --> 16:36.328
From my office. I have,
like, 50 of them. Right.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.370
The recount's over.
They just called the race.

16:40.599 --> 16:41.600
Oh, God.

16:44.536 --> 16:46.209
It's still 21 votes.

16:50.442 --> 16:51.716
But you won.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.821
You won, Leslie.
You won by 21 votes.

16:58.984 --> 17:01.362
It's confirmed.
It's over. You won.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.698
That was
really sneaky, Ann.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.200
I know. I couldn't resist.

17:13.965 --> 17:15.912
Catch your dream

17:16.535 --> 17:19.846
Honestly, I have never been more
relieved in my entire life.

17:19.938 --> 17:24.215
I didn't ruin it. I thought I
ruined it but I didn't ruin it.

17:24.276 --> 17:25.778
You're kind of
ruining it now.

17:25.844 --> 17:29.519
Great. That is great news.
I'm going to see you in D.C.

17:29.581 --> 17:31.026
Yeah, I guess you will.
Yeah.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.588
Damn it. I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye to Chris.

17:34.653 --> 17:36.223
Oh, he's just
right over there.

17:37.489 --> 17:39.059
He seems really busy.

17:39.124 --> 17:41.627
Anyway, would you tell him I said goodbye?
Great. Thank you.

17:41.693 --> 17:42.797
Sorry we didn't
get a chance to meet.

17:42.861 --> 17:44.465
I'm Ann. That doesn't matter.
I'm leaving.

17:46.432 --> 17:49.936
We've got a dream
We're going to chase it

17:50.369 --> 17:52.849
Congratulations,
Mr. Assistant City Manager.

17:54.206 --> 17:56.049
I'm very grateful,
Chris, but I think

17:56.175 --> 17:58.018
I'm going to
turn down the job.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.078
Really? Why?

18:00.045 --> 18:01.217
I like where I am.

18:04.349 --> 18:06.226
Was someone just talking
about a job opening?

18:06.285 --> 18:08.128
Because guess who's
got two thumbs

18:08.187 --> 18:10.997
and was just cleared
from insurance fraud?

18:11.657 --> 18:13.864
This guy.
You know?

18:14.426 --> 18:19.307
Got off on a technicality.
What's the gig? I'm in.

18:19.364 --> 18:20.365
There's no job
for you.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.902
That's a smart move. Go with your gut, right?
I'll talk to you guys soon.

18:25.370 --> 18:27.350
Your victory speech,
Councilwoman Knope.

18:28.540 --> 18:31.077
Someday, when I'm
more emotionally stable,

18:31.143 --> 18:32.781
I want to read the concession
speech you wrote for me.

18:33.912 --> 18:34.913
I never wrote it.

18:36.582 --> 18:39.153
And I know all of you know how
hard she has worked to get here.

18:40.185 --> 18:43.530
<i>She is your next City Councilwoman
from the great city of Pawnee,</i>

18:43.589 --> 18:46.593
ladies and gentlemen, my best
friend in the world, Leslie Knope.

18:51.063 --> 18:53.043
The idea behind this
campaign was a simple one.

18:54.032 --> 18:56.638
That, with hard
work and positivity,

18:56.768 --> 18:59.408
a group of people
can make a difference.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.382
During my term as
your City Councilor...

19:03.575 --> 19:04.576
Thank you.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.656
...I want to focus on your
hopes, and not your fears.

19:08.213 --> 19:11.353
I want to solve problems
instead of creating friction.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.756
And I will work hard,
every hour of every day,

19:15.154 --> 19:17.327
to make Pawnee
a better place to live.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.234
Because I love this city.

19:22.361 --> 19:28.835
And I know, firsthand, how very
special the people of this city are.

19:29.635 --> 19:33.981
I owe this victory, all of it,
to my friends and my supporters.

19:34.239 --> 19:36.378
No one achieves
anything alone.

19:37.109 --> 19:41.956
So let's embark on a new journey together.
Let's break out a map.

19:42.781 --> 19:45.625
Not the old, out-of-date one
that shows where we've been,

19:45.884 --> 19:49.696
but a crisp new one
that shows where we might go.

19:50.722 --> 19:53.498
Let's embark on
a new journey together.

19:55.494 --> 19:56.802
And see where it takes us.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.039
Tommy! This party
was amazing.

20:06.104 --> 20:09.574
You're amazing. You are
ridiculous, but I like you.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.882
And I think that we
should date all of it.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.355
Let's do it.
Let's date.

20:13.412 --> 20:16.552
This is my dream!
"Nostratomus!"

20:16.615 --> 20:18.322
It's happening.
Awesome.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.657
Hey, let's move
in together.

20:19.785 --> 20:21.093
Totally.

20:21.453 --> 20:22.932
Really?
Yeah.

20:22.988 --> 20:25.434
All right. No take-backs when
we sober up, though, partner.

20:25.524 --> 20:27.333
No take-backs,
partner.

20:28.527 --> 20:29.528
We're cowboys.

20:29.595 --> 20:35.341
Great win. Great night. Great year.
Hot wife. Jackpot.

20:38.303 --> 20:39.839
Good job, me.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.748
Oh, my God.
Babe, you know what?

20:41.807 --> 20:44.253
Almost everything you wrote
on that board as a dream job

20:44.309 --> 20:45.549
was some type of
police officer.

20:45.877 --> 20:46.878
Yeah.

20:47.512 --> 20:49.514
You ready to go?
No, listen to me.

20:49.581 --> 20:53.085
How does this sound?
"Officer Dwyer, Pawnee P.D."

20:53.885 --> 20:56.422
Guys, we're going to J.J.'s
for victory waffles,

20:56.521 --> 20:57.829
and then we're
staying up all night

20:57.956 --> 20:59.299
talking about our
lives and our feelings.

20:59.358 --> 21:02.999
Non-negotiable. Let's go.
City Council, bitches!

21:05.264 --> 21:06.299
Jerry forgot to vote.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.006
Damn it, Jerry!
