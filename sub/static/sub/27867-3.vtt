WEBVTT

00:04.760 --> 00:07.279
- Why do I get the heavy end?
- My end's just as heavy!

00:07.280 --> 00:08.670
Where does it go?

00:08.680 --> 00:10.439
Mum, where do you want the couch?

00:10.440 --> 00:11.839
In the living room.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.679
Yes, I know. Where in the living room?

00:13.680 --> 00:15.279
Near the front window.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.839
Well, where are you putting the TV?

00:16.840 --> 00:18.700
In front of the couch.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.400
Are you sure you want the
TV facing the window?

00:20.420 --> 00:22.310
- Because when the sun shines...
- I'm putting it down!

00:22.320 --> 00:24.580
Use your legs.

00:29.720 --> 00:31.040
What's wrong?

00:32.240 --> 00:34.759
I'm just a little miffed Mum never
told me she wanted to sell.

00:34.760 --> 00:38.199
I mean, I wasn't living there
anymore, but I grew up there.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.999
I didn't find out until she'd
already sold the place.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.159
If it makes you feel better,

00:41.160 --> 00:43.239
as her housemate, and
I assume best friend,

00:43.240 --> 00:44.799
I too was left in the dark.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.719
- How's your new room?
- Oh, it's fine.

00:46.720 --> 00:48.439
Barbara took the one with the ensuite.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.919
Even though I called shotgun.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.359
I would just use that toilet anyway

00:51.360 --> 00:52.919
and I would look her in
the eye as you use it.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.199
- Just leave the door wide open.
- Mmm.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.599
Didn't you talk to her about it?

00:56.600 --> 00:58.479
I mean, I'd want to know if
my mum and dad were selling.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.239
I've still got a bunch
of Lego at their place.

01:00.240 --> 01:02.759
Mum just dumped all my
stuff in a cardboard box.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.319
At least she didn't sell it.

01:04.319 --> 01:05.719
Or find your porn mags.

01:05.720 --> 01:08.359
- Oh, I didn't think of that.
- You mean there were porn mags?

01:08.360 --> 01:09.759
- No.
- Gross.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.560
- I said no.
- Dirty boy!

01:11.570 --> 01:12.960
- There were no porn mags.
- Filthy...

01:12.970 --> 01:13.980
- No.
- ... dirty...

01:13.990 --> 01:15.959
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.599
Have you been lifting with your legs?

01:17.600 --> 01:18.839
- We have.
- OK.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.559
So, I was trying to get my
10,000 steps up this morning...

01:22.560 --> 01:23.839
But that's not important right now.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.439
Although, it is important...

01:25.440 --> 01:28.840
Anyway, I found something
I think you should see.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.100
What's happening?

01:33.110 --> 01:35.039
I don't like walking this
fast unless I have to pee.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.279
Or if I'm trying to get to the
car first to lock Daniel out.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.360
Here.

01:39.460 --> 01:40.699
- _
- Oh, God!

01:40.700 --> 01:42.510
What does "RRR" mean?

01:42.520 --> 01:45.199
Redheaded... Rat-Rooter.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.119
Sorry.

01:48.120 --> 01:49.479
Bruce used to call me this at school.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.999
He said he wrote it on the concrete
when we were in grade five

01:52.000 --> 01:53.439
but refused to tell me where.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.639
I thought he was bluffing.

01:54.640 --> 01:56.119
Well, we can just change the meaning.

01:56.120 --> 01:59.759
To... Royal... Redhead of the... Realm.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.279
Or... Radical Robot...

02:02.280 --> 02:04.119
No, I'll know what it means.
I have to get rid of it.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.219
I think it's cool.

02:05.220 --> 02:06.959
It's like your own star
on the Walk of Fame.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.179
Yeah, except it's on the
pavement in Rosehaven

02:09.180 --> 02:10.318
and it says I root rats.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.040
Sorry.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.000
It's been there for 25 years.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.630
Just pretend you never saw it.

02:49.640 --> 02:50.739
I can't un-see it.

02:50.740 --> 02:53.540
And I don't like how close
it is to Mum's new place.

02:53.580 --> 02:55.270
I'll think about it every
time I'm over there.

02:55.280 --> 02:57.919
- Unbelievable!
- Everything OK?

02:57.920 --> 03:00.399
I'm going to pick up some
supplies for tonight.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.679
What's happening tonight?

03:01.680 --> 03:03.039
Jenny's coming!

03:03.040 --> 03:04.879
She just called to tell
me she's driving down.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.039
Right now. Could have given
me some bloody notice!

03:07.040 --> 03:08.999
- I can relate to that.
- Who's that?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.359
My sister.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.999
Oh, my God! Your sister is coming?

03:12.000 --> 03:13.599
She's staying in town tonight.

03:13.600 --> 03:14.719
We're all having dinner together.

03:14.720 --> 03:15.839
Seven o'clock.

03:15.840 --> 03:18.479
- OK!
- Call me if you see her.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.799
Wow!

03:22.800 --> 03:25.079
Barbara's sister? What's she like?

03:25.080 --> 03:26.259
She's got to be tougher than Barbara

03:26.260 --> 03:27.679
if she's got her acting like that.

03:27.680 --> 03:28.919
Does she ride a motorbike?

03:28.920 --> 03:30.680
Is she a tattoo artist? Body builder?

03:30.740 --> 03:32.080
She might be now.

03:32.110 --> 03:33.600
What do you mean? How long
since you've seen her?

03:33.660 --> 03:34.839
Oh, 10-ish years.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.279
I didn't have much to
do with her growing up.

03:36.280 --> 03:37.479
10 years? Why so long?

03:37.480 --> 03:38.940
Well, I've only heard
Mum's side of the story,

03:38.950 --> 03:41.239
but according to her,
it's none of my business.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.039
Aren't you curious?

03:43.040 --> 03:45.000
Well, yeah, but Mum never
tells me anything, so...

03:46.360 --> 03:47.959
Where are you going?

03:47.960 --> 03:49.319
I'm gonna head out for a bit.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.439
OK, well, if everyone's
leaving, I'm leaving too.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.239
- Where are you going?
- With you.

03:53.240 --> 03:54.440
Oh.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.799
Welcome to Green Valley
Council. How can I help you?

04:11.800 --> 04:13.020
Uh, we'd like to inquire

04:13.030 --> 04:15.119
about getting a public
footpath reconcreted.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.119
Please hold.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.600
OK.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.799
They're coming.

04:22.800 --> 04:23.880
Thanks.

04:28.280 --> 04:31.300
You wanted Infrastructure and Amenities?

04:31.340 --> 04:34.550
Uh, maybe. I'd like to get a
public footpath reconcreted.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.959
OK. Well, who am I speaking to?

04:36.960 --> 04:38.879
- Daniel McCallum.
- And Emma Dawes.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.279
That's Emma Dawes, not Em Adores.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.359
Uh, whereabouts is this footpath?

04:43.360 --> 04:44.640
Declan Avenue in Rosehaven.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.150
And why does it need to be redone?

04:46.160 --> 04:48.959
Uh, someone has carved an offensive
slogan into the concrete.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.759
Is it a safety hazard?

04:50.760 --> 04:53.119
Well, I mean, you can't trip
on it, but it's offensive.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.380
Unless it's a safety hazard,

04:54.400 --> 04:56.630
then it's not policy
to replace a footpath.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.839
OK, so, if someone writes
a comment into wet cement

04:58.840 --> 05:01.039
that the whole neighbourhood
finds extremely offensive,

05:01.040 --> 05:02.239
you won't fix it?

05:02.240 --> 05:03.799
What's the comment?

05:03.800 --> 05:05.360
"Danny is an RRR."

05:06.520 --> 05:08.639
Redheaded rat-rooter.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.039
What's your name again?

05:10.040 --> 05:11.799
- Daniel.
- Danny for short.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.479
And does the whole neighbourhood
find this offensive, or just you?

05:14.480 --> 05:17.599
Well, there could be other people
in the neighbourhood called Daniel.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.540
OK, well, maybe it is a tripping hazard.

05:19.550 --> 05:20.999
I mean, if you're on rollerblades

05:21.000 --> 05:23.679
and your wheels get caught in one
of the indents made by the letters,

05:23.680 --> 05:24.999
you could fall and hurt yourself.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.879
We haven't received any complaints.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.279
- I'm complaining.
- I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.399
- What if we fix it ourselves?
- You can't.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.719
It has to be done by a
council-approved tradesperson

05:33.720 --> 05:35.039
and we have to approve the work.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.159
OK, well, you just lost my vote.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.839
I'm not an elected official.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.439
Well, whoever hired
you has lost my vote.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.799
I'm not hired by an elected...

05:41.800 --> 05:44.319
Well, have fun scraping a bunch of
dead rollerbladers off the pavement!

05:44.320 --> 05:45.940
- We might go.
- Went too far, didn't I?

05:45.950 --> 05:47.440
Just a bit.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.399
Maybe we call them

05:55.400 --> 05:56.959
and pretend to be other
people in the neighbourhood

05:56.960 --> 05:58.439
who also want it fixed.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.599
- I can do a British accent.
- They'd never buy it.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.919
But what if I can do a real good one?

06:02.920 --> 06:04.359
- Ugh!
- You do one.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.519
Um... Are you gonna eat that muffin?

06:06.520 --> 06:08.839
Oh, you're right. Oh!
That was really good.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.399
Whew! Am I in England?!

06:10.400 --> 06:12.879
Daniel! Oh, my goodness. Is that you?

06:12.880 --> 06:15.279
Hi. Aunty Jenny. Yeah.

06:15.280 --> 06:18.239
You've grown into a very handsome man.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.799
Oh, uh... uh, thank you.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.279
And who's this lovely lady?

06:21.280 --> 06:22.679
I'm Emma. Nice to meet you.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.199
I never get to meet any
of Daniel's family.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.639
Apart from Barbara, obviously.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.499
Us McCallums tend to spread out.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.199
Can conquer more ground that way.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.879
- I'm in Hobart.
- Ooh, the city!

06:31.880 --> 06:34.559
What are you doing here, Daniel?
You're not working here, are you?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.919
Uh, yes. Yes, I am.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.439
Well, good for you!

06:38.440 --> 06:40.719
Barbara doesn't tell me
very much, I'm afraid.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.759
She must be very proud of you.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.279
Yeah...

06:44.280 --> 06:45.999
Are you two a... couple?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.140
No!

06:47.160 --> 06:49.759
Daniel begged me to leave the
mainland to come help him out.

06:49.760 --> 06:51.159
Well, I didn't even ask, but...

06:51.160 --> 06:54.799
So Barbara has her own little team.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.839
She's doing so well.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.239
I feel like deep down she
knows how lucky she is.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.399
Can you believe she sold the house?

07:01.400 --> 07:03.119
I was very surprised.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.479
You... didn't know she was selling?

07:05.480 --> 07:07.559
No, but she knows more
about real estate than me.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.600
Oh.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.199
- Hello, Jen.
- Babs!

07:12.200 --> 07:13.559
So good to see you.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.959
"Babs"!

07:14.960 --> 07:17.159
You look well. Really well.

07:17.160 --> 07:18.759
You too.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.879
How about we have a seat in my office?

07:20.880 --> 07:22.719
Ooh. The office!

07:22.720 --> 07:24.040
Sounds lovely.

07:27.440 --> 07:28.959
Aunty Jenny didn't know either.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.439
Do you think Barbara will
let me call her Babs?

07:31.440 --> 07:33.320
I want to be there the
first time you try it.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.919
The office looks different.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.319
- We've moved.
- Oh.

07:42.320 --> 07:45.039
So strange being back
here after so long.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.999
I was happy to find
the bakery still makes

07:47.000 --> 07:48.599
the best vanilla slice around.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.800
I'm more of a hedgehog woman myself.

07:52.320 --> 07:55.519
So... you sold our house.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.159
- I did.
- Can I ask why?

07:58.160 --> 08:01.199
I wanted to move and it
was a seller's market.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.999
Don't suppose you thought of telling me?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.039
I did tell you.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.319
After you sold it!

08:06.320 --> 08:08.079
But the thing is...

08:08.080 --> 08:10.380
correct me if I'm wrong,
it was left to both of us.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.259
Mum made me the sole executor.

08:12.260 --> 08:13.759
I didn't need your permission.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.999
I don't think a phone
call was too much to ask.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.239
I'm the one who took
over the repayments.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.519
And I made sure you got your
fair share of the sale.

08:20.520 --> 08:22.199
Yes. Thank you very much.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.779
You've always been better
with money than me.

08:23.780 --> 08:25.759
It's just that...

08:25.760 --> 08:27.840
... this isn't about the money, is it?

08:29.080 --> 08:31.239
God! I want to know what they're saying!

08:31.240 --> 08:33.679
I'm gonna go do some work.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.919
So you can hear them
through the glass? Smart.

08:35.919 --> 08:37.840
I'm gonna 'do work' too.

08:39.240 --> 08:41.318
- Wait, is that Grace's?
- No.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.759
Maybe. She's got loads.

08:42.760 --> 08:43.919
What's your plan? Put it on the wall?

08:43.919 --> 08:45.199
It's glass. They'll see you.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.279
I was gonna duck down.

08:46.280 --> 08:47.840
Just grab a pen or something and...

08:50.000 --> 08:53.279
Did Mum's radio survive the
move, or did you sell that too?

08:53.280 --> 08:54.759
Of course not!

08:54.760 --> 08:56.079
Good. I want it.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.399
What?

08:57.400 --> 09:00.039
- I want Mum's radio.
- Well, you can't have it.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.159
I'm the one who's been
dusting it for years.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.479
Well, I'm happy to take
over that burden for you.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.759
It's fine, thanks. I've
gotten very good at it.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.059
You've had it for ages. It's my turn.

09:09.060 --> 09:11.150
You only want it because I'm using it.

09:11.160 --> 09:12.479
You have to share.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.540
You'll break it.

09:13.550 --> 09:15.759
Is this about Daisy Dalmatian still?

09:15.760 --> 09:17.239
The tail was loose!

09:17.240 --> 09:18.600
It wasn't loose. You pulled it off.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.510
Well, a radio doesn't have a tail.

09:20.520 --> 09:21.760
You're not getting it!

09:22.720 --> 09:24.760
Temper.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.439
Oh, I've just got a
standard room at the pub.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.919
There isn't even a minibar.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.319
What if minibars had mini bartenders?

09:41.320 --> 09:42.960
Making mini cocktails?

09:43.960 --> 09:45.559
You could have stayed here.

09:45.560 --> 09:47.760
I didn't want to put you
out. You've just moved.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.819
Um... Mum, would you be able

09:51.820 --> 09:53.470
to speak to someone you
know at the council for me?

09:53.480 --> 09:54.480
Why?

09:54.481 --> 09:56.719
I want to get a slab
of concrete replaced.

09:56.720 --> 09:57.919
What for?

09:57.920 --> 10:00.079
You know how Bruce used
to call me a redheaded...

10:00.080 --> 10:02.239
Rat-rooter, yeah.

10:02.240 --> 10:03.419
Well, when we were little,

10:03.420 --> 10:06.180
he wrote "Danny is an
RRR" into wet cement,

10:06.200 --> 10:07.719
and it's still there.

10:07.720 --> 10:08.999
So?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.479
So, it's insulting.

10:10.480 --> 10:12.759
And the council won't let me change
it unless it's a safety hazard.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.079
That's awful!

10:14.080 --> 10:15.759
Well, if it's not in
their policy to fix it,

10:15.760 --> 10:17.359
nothing I say will change that.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.159
Yeah, but they won't even
let me fix it myself.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.560
So, let it go.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.839
It's OK to be emotional.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.159
Like me.

10:25.160 --> 10:28.039
I didn't think I'd be so affected
about losing my childhood home.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.799
Maybe because it came as such a shock.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.399
Can we just have dinner?

10:31.400 --> 10:33.500
I'm just curious to know
what you all think.

10:33.580 --> 10:35.879
Should Babs have told me
about the sale beforehand?

10:35.880 --> 10:36.999
I might be wrong.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.640
Fine. Who wants to weigh in?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.360
Daniel?

10:44.640 --> 10:46.080
Um... well...

10:47.520 --> 10:49.840
Actually, a bit of notice
would have been nice.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.519
Well, I-I was talking to Grace
before a-and she agrees.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.880
You have thoughts too, Grace?

10:55.920 --> 10:57.080
I think...

10:58.600 --> 11:00.599
... that I have finished my dinner

11:00.600 --> 11:02.799
and I'm gonna go put
my plate in the sink.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.880
How about you, Emma?

11:11.640 --> 11:13.439
Mmm!

11:13.440 --> 11:14.880
All done!

11:18.640 --> 11:21.240
She didn't tell you either?
That must have hurt.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.319
Um...

11:23.320 --> 11:26.119
Yeah. Yeah, it... it did.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.239
Neither of you were living at the place

11:28.240 --> 11:30.319
and I was the one who
took care of it, alone,

11:30.320 --> 11:31.759
for God knows how many years.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.919
Now, if I want to move,
I'm allowed to move!

11:33.920 --> 11:36.519
Don't you get sentimental
about anything?

11:36.520 --> 11:38.359
Just another house to sell, was it?

11:38.360 --> 11:41.159
I'm sick of talking about
this. What's done is done.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.219
And if you're both gonna
keep on going on about it,

11:43.220 --> 11:44.720
I'm going to bed!

11:46.240 --> 11:48.220
That's not a very mature
way to handle things!

11:51.680 --> 11:54.080
We have every right to be upset.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.200
Yeah.

11:56.210 --> 11:58.570
Even growing up, she
always had to be right.

12:00.410 --> 12:03.560
I was a public servant. I'll
call the council for you.

12:03.570 --> 12:05.360
They may not be willing
to reconcrete it,

12:05.370 --> 12:06.899
but I'm sure I'll be able
to get you permission

12:06.900 --> 12:08.169
to change it yourself.

12:08.170 --> 12:11.000
Really? Oh, that'd be great. Thank you.

12:11.010 --> 12:12.440
It's no hassle.

12:12.450 --> 12:14.120
And to be honest...

12:14.130 --> 12:16.410
... I was actually hoping
you could do me a favour.

12:21.330 --> 12:23.200
Are you super-duper sure

12:23.210 --> 12:25.760
you want to give Barbara's
stuff to Jenny without asking?

12:25.770 --> 12:27.480
If Mum were sentimental about stuff,

12:27.490 --> 12:29.200
she wouldn't have sold
the house so quickly

12:29.210 --> 12:30.880
and just shoved all my stuff in a box.

12:30.890 --> 12:32.280
OK. If you're sure.

12:32.290 --> 12:34.720
Stop me if I go to buy a custard tart.

12:34.730 --> 12:36.090
You got it.

12:38.690 --> 12:40.120
Good morning!

12:40.130 --> 12:41.440
- Hi.
- Oh. Morning.

12:41.450 --> 12:42.960
Do you want a coffee
or anything? My treat.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.960
- Oh, no, it's fine. You don't have to.
- Please.

12:44.970 --> 12:48.560
Um... uh, can I get a
long black, please?

12:48.570 --> 12:50.360
Mikayla, do you have
any almond milk yet?

12:50.370 --> 12:53.600
No. It tastes terrible and no-one
wants to drink it but you.

12:53.610 --> 12:55.600
Well, if I brought some in, could
you make my coffee with it?

12:55.610 --> 12:56.960
No.

12:56.970 --> 12:58.720
Weak long black, please.

12:58.730 --> 13:00.640
I've got good news.

13:00.650 --> 13:02.200
I spoke to the council this morning.

13:02.210 --> 13:04.579
I've got you approval to
fix the concrete yourself.

13:04.580 --> 13:06.240
It's not as good as them fixing it,

13:06.250 --> 13:07.659
but the best I could manage, I'm afraid.

13:07.660 --> 13:09.440
No, no, that's great. Thank you.

13:09.450 --> 13:11.520
Don't suppose you had any
luck with the radio?

13:11.530 --> 13:13.210
Uh, maybe.

13:14.650 --> 13:16.120
Is this it?

13:16.130 --> 13:19.360
Yes! That's it! Oh, thank you!

13:19.370 --> 13:21.720
Oh, I'm so glad you found it.

13:21.730 --> 13:23.240
I thought she might have thrown it out.

13:23.250 --> 13:24.640
Oh, no worries.

13:24.650 --> 13:27.200
Now we just have to figure out how
to get the footpath reconcreted.

13:27.210 --> 13:29.880
Well, it seems to me the boy
that did it should pay for it.

13:29.890 --> 13:31.090
Mmm.

13:32.370 --> 13:33.640
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

13:33.650 --> 13:35.600
Did you want anything else?

13:35.610 --> 13:38.380
- A custard tart, please.
- Two.

13:43.370 --> 13:45.090
Yeah, it's open. Come in.

13:47.650 --> 13:49.120
Danny. What are you doing here?

13:49.130 --> 13:50.960
Em, if you're here to convince me

13:50.970 --> 13:53.560
to go on another date with you,
you've got to let me go, it's over.

13:53.620 --> 13:55.080
I don't want to go on
another date with you.

13:55.090 --> 13:56.360
Pfft!

13:56.370 --> 13:58.040
I wish we'd never gone on the first one!

13:58.050 --> 13:59.600
Yeah, Bruce, can I talk
to you for a second?

13:59.610 --> 14:01.320
Sorry, mate. A little bit busy here.

14:01.330 --> 14:02.920
We're down to the last
couple of players.

14:02.930 --> 14:04.440
- Mate, revive me.
- Yep, yep.

14:04.460 --> 14:05.520
Can you pause it, please?

14:05.530 --> 14:06.839
No, it's an online match.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.009
You can't pause real life, mate.

14:08.010 --> 14:10.080
I found your message in the cement.

14:10.090 --> 14:11.560
What message?

14:11.570 --> 14:13.720
"Danny is an RRR."

14:13.730 --> 14:16.520
- Redheaded rat-rooter!
- What?!

14:16.530 --> 14:18.400
I did that ages ago. Did
you only just find it?

14:18.410 --> 14:20.440
Yes, and I want you to pay
to have it reconcreted.

14:20.450 --> 14:21.519
What?

14:21.520 --> 14:23.089
You should pay to have it replaced.

14:23.090 --> 14:24.780
Mate, I was 10.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.120
Well, you still did the
wrong thing, so...

14:27.130 --> 14:29.480
And a rollerblader could trip on it.

14:29.490 --> 14:30.560
I rollerblade.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.480
- What? Do you?
- Yeah.

14:32.490 --> 14:34.080
You don't fall off that easily.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.840
And if you do, you shouldn't
be on the blades.

14:35.850 --> 14:37.059
Yeah, sorry, can we get back to it?

14:37.060 --> 14:38.329
Yeah, sorry, mate, I can't help you.

14:38.330 --> 14:40.039
I did that ages ago and I don't call you

14:40.040 --> 14:41.169
a redheaded rat-rooter anymore,

14:41.170 --> 14:42.800
so... we're even.

14:42.810 --> 14:44.080
No, we're not!

14:44.090 --> 14:47.290
- Revive me!
- Yeah, stop running off on your own!

14:48.050 --> 14:49.100
Run!

14:49.110 --> 14:50.330
- Hey!
- Whoo!

14:57.890 --> 14:59.560
That looks great.

14:59.570 --> 15:01.800
Yeah. Nice and flat.

15:01.810 --> 15:03.320
Oddly satisfying.

15:03.330 --> 15:05.280
Thank you so much for this, Damien.

15:05.290 --> 15:08.000
No worries. It'll take a
while to dry, though.

15:08.010 --> 15:09.760
- So, how have you been?
- I'll get going.

15:09.770 --> 15:12.360
- Oh, sorry. Um... I can stay.
- Oh. No.

15:12.370 --> 15:13.439
- What?
- Oh, no, nothing.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.400
Um... oh, we should get back to it too.

15:15.410 --> 15:18.040
OK. Um... I'll go.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.610
Um... thanks again, mate.

15:20.690 --> 15:21.890
No worries.

15:23.210 --> 15:24.490
I'll take one of those.

15:25.490 --> 15:26.730
Bye.

15:44.090 --> 15:46.440
- You OK?
- Yeah. Why?

15:46.450 --> 15:48.480
Oh, I just thought,
seeing Damien again...

15:48.490 --> 15:50.080
- I mean, you seem fine.
- I was.

15:50.090 --> 15:51.319
You could have kissed
him in front of me.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.639
- Wouldn't have cared.
- Yeah, cool.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.750
It's just, you don't have to hide
it from me if it still hurts.

15:54.760 --> 15:56.100
It doesn't. I shook his hand.

15:56.140 --> 15:57.860
Yeah, you're right. Very
normal interaction.

15:59.130 --> 16:01.280
- What you doing, Danny?
- Nothing.

16:01.290 --> 16:02.960
Is that new concrete?

16:02.970 --> 16:04.400
What do you want, Bruce?

16:04.410 --> 16:06.200
Just driving past to have
a look at my handiwork.

16:06.210 --> 16:08.020
Part of Rosehaven's rich heritage.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.880
- Yeah, well, it's gone now, so...
- Right.

16:09.890 --> 16:12.600
So, you're both just gonna stand
there until the cement dries?

16:12.610 --> 16:14.760
I'm not gonna touch it, mate. I was 10.

16:14.770 --> 16:16.160
We enjoy standing here.

16:16.170 --> 16:17.920
We're probably gonna make
it a regular hangout spot.

16:17.930 --> 16:19.240
Yeah, and there's a car coming now.

16:19.250 --> 16:21.040
So you should probably move on.

16:21.050 --> 16:22.680
Don't appreciate you
turning off our game.

16:22.700 --> 16:24.720
I only turned off the TV,
mate. I'm not a monster.

16:24.730 --> 16:26.600
The game would have still been
going when you turned it back on.

16:26.620 --> 16:28.280
Yeah, but Maddrick bled out
and we lost the match!

16:28.300 --> 16:30.090
Oh, I'm real sorry, mate!

16:35.330 --> 16:37.530
- He's gonna try and rewrite it.
- Yes, he is.

16:39.970 --> 16:41.680
Well, I've never seen you do it.

16:41.690 --> 16:43.880
That doesn't prove anything.
I brush my hair every day.

16:43.890 --> 16:45.920
- Why? Does it do anything?
- Yes!

16:45.930 --> 16:48.150
It's just... I can't imagine
it would look any different

16:48.160 --> 16:49.950
- if you hadn't have brushed it.
- It looks way different.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.139
You wouldn't recognise me.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.720
I think I'd still be able to
pick you out of a line-up.

16:52.730 --> 16:53.730
No.

16:55.330 --> 16:57.600
How long till it dries? I
need to go to the toilet.

16:57.610 --> 16:58.840
Yeah, me too.

16:58.850 --> 17:01.000
- Well, you can just go in a bush.
- It's a number two.

17:01.010 --> 17:02.880
- Yuck!
- Oh, you've never pooed before?

17:02.890 --> 17:04.319
I'm gonna go ask one of these houses.

17:04.329 --> 17:05.560
Can you ask for me too, please?

17:05.569 --> 17:07.959
There is no way I am
combining my polite pee

17:07.960 --> 17:09.000
with your gross number two.

17:09.010 --> 17:11.240
- Please?
- Go dig a hole somewhere.

17:27.490 --> 17:28.800
What are you doing?

17:28.810 --> 17:32.120
I'm, uh... waiting for
some wet concrete to dry.

17:32.130 --> 17:33.960
And why would you be doing that?

17:33.970 --> 17:35.280
In case Bruce comes back.

17:35.290 --> 17:37.219
So you got it fixed?

17:37.220 --> 17:38.769
I thought I said to leave it alone.

17:38.770 --> 17:41.160
Well, Aunty Jenny convinced the
council to let me change it,

17:41.170 --> 17:42.800
so... I changed it.

17:42.810 --> 17:45.410
Did she also convince you
to give her my radio?

17:46.730 --> 17:48.120
She thought you were gonna throw it out.

17:48.130 --> 17:49.280
Of course not!

17:49.290 --> 17:51.960
As usual, she's just being
manipulative to get her own way.

17:51.970 --> 17:53.760
Well, she's been nothing
but lovely to me.

17:53.770 --> 17:56.280
I don't know what she was like
growing up, but people can change.

17:56.290 --> 17:57.880
Not her. It's an act.

17:57.890 --> 17:59.640
Well, why do you care about a radio?

17:59.650 --> 18:01.600
It's not like anything has
sentimental value to you.

18:01.610 --> 18:04.200
I mean, my room, you just packed
it up and then gave me a box.

18:04.210 --> 18:05.680
Those are your things.

18:05.690 --> 18:07.760
And no, I don't have a
sentimental attachment

18:07.770 --> 18:09.400
to your comic books and porn mags.

18:09.410 --> 18:10.800
Oh, there were porn mags.

18:10.810 --> 18:12.320
Get in the car.

18:12.330 --> 18:14.250
You gave it to her, you can get it back.

18:15.410 --> 18:16.490
No.

18:18.610 --> 18:20.080
Excuse me?

18:20.090 --> 18:22.640
I... I'm gonna stay until it dries.

18:22.650 --> 18:24.480
I don't want a reminder
of how much I got bullied

18:24.490 --> 18:26.040
etched into the concrete again.

18:26.050 --> 18:27.720
You could paint that
concrete with rainbows

18:27.730 --> 18:30.080
and you'd still be reminded
about how you got bullied.

18:30.090 --> 18:32.200
You have to move on yourself.

18:32.210 --> 18:34.560
I can't just let go of
stuff like you, Mum.

18:34.570 --> 18:36.199
This concrete means something to me.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.049
Like the house meant something to me.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.440
Same with Aunty Jenny.

18:39.450 --> 18:40.720
I mean, what about the business?

18:40.730 --> 18:42.930
Are you just gonna sell that
one day without telling me?

18:43.890 --> 18:45.600
Hey, Barbara.

18:45.610 --> 18:47.680
Uh, No. 2 said you could
use their toilet.

18:47.690 --> 18:49.760
What are the odds? Number two.

18:49.770 --> 18:51.120
What did I miss?

18:51.130 --> 18:53.010
You'd better go deal with that.

18:54.170 --> 18:56.080
Get out of it, you mongrel!

18:56.090 --> 18:58.080
Hey! You're done for!

18:58.090 --> 19:00.450
Go! Get going!

19:08.450 --> 19:10.800
- Did you make it in time?
- Success.

19:10.810 --> 19:13.480
- Did Bruce come back?
- Nah. I'm too intimidating.

19:13.490 --> 19:16.610
Plus, I've been turning on the spot
to keep an eye in all directions.

19:17.770 --> 19:19.000
Hey, uh, I was thinking...

19:19.010 --> 19:20.560
While you were on the toilet?
Gross. Don't want to know.

19:20.640 --> 19:24.040
No, no, I was thinking... I
should write it back in.

19:24.050 --> 19:25.280
What?

19:25.290 --> 19:27.879
Well, if I can't dismiss
stuff like Mum can,

19:27.880 --> 19:29.209
maybe I should embrace it.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.520
I mean, if I hadn't have gone through
what I went through as a kid,

19:31.530 --> 19:33.320
I might not have Grace in my life.

19:33.330 --> 19:34.490
Or you.

19:35.810 --> 19:37.130
This is part of that.

19:46.740 --> 19:50.840
_

19:52.930 --> 19:54.360
That was a real nice thing you said.

19:54.370 --> 19:55.880
Thanks.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.000
But you can feel that way

19:57.010 --> 20:00.130
and not have "Danny is a redheaded
rat-rooter" engraved in concrete.

20:01.130 --> 20:02.650
You're right. That was dumb.

20:04.010 --> 20:05.840
Hey, you didn't laugh at
"redheaded rat-rooter".

20:05.850 --> 20:07.440
Never mind.

20:08.810 --> 20:11.730
I mean... Oh!

20:15.610 --> 20:18.040
Thanks for coming. I
wasn't sure you would.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.359
That's OK.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.289
I thought you were gonna let me
leave without saying goodbye.

20:21.290 --> 20:23.560
One second.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.520
OK, tomorrow, come in
without brushing it

20:25.530 --> 20:26.920
and we'll see if it looks any different.

20:26.930 --> 20:28.280
Why do you think I buy hair gel?

20:28.290 --> 20:29.640
Daniel?

20:29.650 --> 20:31.210
Come in here, please.

20:38.210 --> 20:39.610
Hi.

20:42.970 --> 20:45.320
It was my house and my choice.

20:45.330 --> 20:46.920
It happened quickly.

20:46.930 --> 20:49.000
I was given a good offer and I took it.

20:49.010 --> 20:51.720
I'm getting too old to
look after all that land.

20:51.730 --> 20:54.080
I should have called you
first before I sold it.

20:54.090 --> 20:56.010
It was left to both of us.

20:57.170 --> 20:59.520
Well. This is a surprise.

20:59.530 --> 21:01.280
You too.

21:01.290 --> 21:03.200
You grew up there. You deserved to know.

21:03.210 --> 21:05.690
Um... thank you.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.010
I'm sorry. To both of you.

21:10.210 --> 21:12.760
I know that can't have
been easy for you, Babs.

21:12.770 --> 21:16.320
And I can see that you've really
grown from this experience.

21:16.330 --> 21:17.640
Thanks.

21:17.650 --> 21:20.330
I wasn't sure at first, but I'm
really glad I made the trip.

21:27.210 --> 21:29.320
It was very lovely meeting you, Emma.

21:29.330 --> 21:32.080
You too! Maybe one day you can
meet my sister's housemate.

21:32.090 --> 21:33.720
- Um...
- Doesn't matter.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.420
Hello? McCallum Real Estate.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.720
- Mrs. Marsh.
- Bye, Jen.

21:39.830 --> 21:41.780
Daniel. All the best.

21:41.790 --> 21:43.660
Bye, Aunty Jenny. Thanks
again for all your help.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.420
- You're very welcome.
- Oh.

21:45.430 --> 21:47.300
Until next time, Babs.

21:47.310 --> 21:49.350
Are we a hug or a handshake now?

21:50.420 --> 21:52.140
Right.

21:53.410 --> 21:55.010
No, I don't think so.

21:56.050 --> 21:57.520
- Bye!
- Bye.

22:01.010 --> 22:02.840
Mum, I think this is the first time

22:02.850 --> 22:04.400
I've changed your mind about something.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.740
And I don't want to make
a big deal out of it,

22:06.780 --> 22:08.960
but... this is a huge deal.

22:08.970 --> 22:12.320
Daniel, that was the council.

22:12.330 --> 22:14.240
- The council?
- Yeah.

22:14.250 --> 22:18.560
They said they'll be sending you a
bill to have the concrete redone.

22:18.570 --> 22:19.800
Why?

22:19.810 --> 22:23.520
They said you "illegally
altered public works".

22:23.530 --> 22:26.000
No, no. Aunty Jenny got
me approval to fix it.

22:26.010 --> 22:28.720
Told you. She's a liar. Hasn't changed.

22:28.730 --> 22:31.360
No, but... but she said...

22:31.370 --> 22:32.880
Oh, God!

22:36.330 --> 22:37.520
Did I forget something?

22:37.530 --> 22:39.360
No, no, Aunty Jenny, when
you spoke to the council...

22:39.370 --> 22:40.560
I'm sorry?

22:40.570 --> 22:42.799
The council, to get me
approval to fix the concrete.

22:42.800 --> 22:43.810
Who'd you speak to?

22:43.880 --> 22:45.400
I never called the council.

22:45.410 --> 22:46.600
You said you did.

22:46.610 --> 22:47.840
I don't remember that.

22:47.850 --> 22:50.080
No, no, we were at the bakery and
you said you got me approval.

22:50.090 --> 22:52.560
I'm very sorry, Daniel,
but I don't think I did.

22:52.570 --> 22:54.080
I really have to get going.

22:54.090 --> 22:56.360
- It was lovely seeing you again.
- No, no, no, Aunty Jenny...

22:56.370 --> 22:58.280
Aunty Jenny, the council...

22:58.290 --> 23:00.680
Uh, A-Aunty Jenny, you
said you spoke to them.

23:07.370 --> 23:08.800
What happened?

23:08.810 --> 23:10.480
She just... denied it.

23:10.490 --> 23:13.320
I... I'm not making it up.
Emma and I were both there.

23:13.330 --> 23:15.960
She said she'd done it,
then I had a custard tart.

23:15.970 --> 23:17.560
She's a liar!

23:17.570 --> 23:19.280
I know. She's always been that way.

23:19.290 --> 23:20.960
Why do you think I don't keep in touch?

23:20.970 --> 23:23.360
Oh! I gave her your radio.

23:23.370 --> 23:24.930
Mrs. Marsh?

23:26.570 --> 23:29.800
I got her to grab it out of Jen's
bag while we were in my office.

23:29.810 --> 23:31.520
Is that why you called us in?

23:31.530 --> 23:34.040
No. You both deserved an apology.

23:34.050 --> 23:35.600
But it's my bloody radio.

23:35.610 --> 23:37.680
Always two moves ahead. Nice one, Babs.

23:37.690 --> 23:38.920
Nup.

23:38.930 --> 23:40.040
Got it.

23:40.050 --> 23:41.370
But...

23:43.370 --> 23:44.960
I d...

23:44.970 --> 23:46.450
I'm sorry, mate.

23:51.050 --> 23:52.609
Looks the same.

23:52.610 --> 23:57.380

23:59.410 --> 24:01.319
Just admit you don't know where we are.

24:01.320 --> 24:02.330
I will not admit that.

24:03.250 --> 24:04.320
Push harder!

24:04.330 --> 24:05.760
I'm not saving my strength for anything!

24:05.770 --> 24:07.480
We are gonna die out here, aren't we?

24:07.490 --> 24:09.120
- Hello?
- G'day.

24:09.130 --> 24:11.000
We're in the middle of nowhere
and there's a guy out there

24:11.010 --> 24:12.400
who neither of us could beat in a fight.

24:12.410 --> 24:13.540
Speak for yourself.

24:13.550 --> 24:15.760
I would just like us to have
some sort of phrase or signal

24:15.770 --> 24:17.580
that means 'run back to the car'.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.410
- What?
- We have to go now!

24:21.410 --> 24:24.120
I'm sorry, you'll have to
pay to have it reconcreted.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.119
It's already been reconcreted.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.809
My Aunty Jenny said I had approval.

24:27.810 --> 24:30.800
I never received a call from a
Jenny in reference to this.

24:30.810 --> 24:33.240
Yes, I know. She lied
to me. I was tricked.

24:33.250 --> 24:35.320
So it's... not really my fault.

24:35.330 --> 24:36.440
Tell you what.

24:36.460 --> 24:38.019
We'll reconcrete the slab you altered...

24:38.020 --> 24:39.029
Yes?

24:39.030 --> 24:40.840
... and you pay us the
cost of having it redone.

24:40.850 --> 24:42.640
Plus a fine.

24:42.650 --> 24:44.240
Oh!

24:44.250 --> 24:47.800
My name's Jenny and I did call you!

24:47.810 --> 24:49.680
- I said 'ello!
- Stop.
