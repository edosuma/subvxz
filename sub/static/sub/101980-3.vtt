WEBVTT

01:03.063 --> 01:04.940
Oh, no. No.

01:06.942 --> 01:09.403
Please, please, please.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.659
No!

01:18.662 --> 01:20.622
See? There's nothing to worry about.

01:20.706 --> 01:23.083
Actually, there's a lot to worry about.

01:23.166 --> 01:26.211
Your placenta is lying low
and covering your cervix.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.255
Placenta previa.

01:28.338 --> 01:32.134
It's marginal, but any movement
or activity could make it acute

01:32.217 --> 01:34.178
and put you into early labor.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.554
No hospitals.

01:36.388 --> 01:39.099
-Sean, tell her.
-Yeah, we've seen a lot of hospitals.

01:41.435 --> 01:45.981
We want that little boy
to have the best chance, don't we?

01:47.316 --> 01:50.402
Which means keeping you
off your feet for the next month.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.821
Well, I'll just stay right here in bed.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.448
Won't I, Sean?

01:55.782 --> 02:00.662
If those feet touch the ground,
you're coming into the hospital.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.291
A month in bed?

02:07.127 --> 02:08.377
Easy-peasy.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.412
Anything?

02:42.496 --> 02:46.583
Roxborough sighting turned out to be
some skinny stoner who works in PetSmart.

02:46.667 --> 02:50.587
Apparently his colleagues
have had it out for him for months.

02:52.005 --> 02:57.803
Chestnut Hill was a much better likeness,
but... not her.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.479
See, this is the problem
with asking the public for help.

03:07.563 --> 03:09.648
The public are not always reliable.

03:12.359 --> 03:15.237
And Old City was a bust,
so I sent Julian out to West Chester.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.738
I should check in on him.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.117
Leanne is on this list.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.202
I can feel it.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.006
Sean.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.342
There's no fucker home.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.803
Have you tried knocking hard enough?

03:39.887 --> 03:42.931
Not an option.
I buzzed the gate, but no reply.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.519
What do you want me to do now?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.731
Hang tight.
I'm gonna find out who lives there.

03:52.649 --> 03:53.901
This is a fucking disaster.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.320
Yeah, but she seems like
she's back to her old self.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.363
And this is smart.
It might turn up something.

03:58.447 --> 03:59.656
And then what?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.658
Let me see the house again.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.165
It's fucking enormous. Is that one house?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.958
Yeah. I took a satellite peek.

04:10.542 --> 04:13.128
It's disgustingly excessive. I want one.

04:13.212 --> 04:16.005
Okay, the owners of the house
are the Marino family.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.551
They're something in electronics.
Heavy churchgoers.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.680
Who needs this much security?

04:23.764 --> 04:24.890
Rich people.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.725
People in hiding.

04:27.851 --> 04:28.852
Someone's coming.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.658
-What is it? A message?
-Hang on.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.633
It's a fucking take-out menu.

05:00.175 --> 05:02.678
That's it. I've been driving all night.
I'm coming back,

05:02.761 --> 05:05.389
and I expect breakfast with bacon.

05:05.472 --> 05:08.100
None of that low-sodium bullshit.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.688
There's no post on social media
for four days. It's not like her at all.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.357
She's always putting pictures up
of the two sons of hers.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.860
Maybe they're on vacation or busy.

05:21.071 --> 05:24.449
May Markham could be holding
that family prisoner in their own home.

05:24.533 --> 05:28.328
Or worse, they could be brainwashing them
with their sick beliefs.

05:28.412 --> 05:31.582
Possible sighting of Leanne.
One of a dozen.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.375
You saw how the others panned out.

05:33.876 --> 05:35.460
Why are you so pessimistic?

05:36.170 --> 05:39.381
This is the closest
we've been to our son in over a week.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.676
He could be on the other side of
those gates, and you're making hummus!

05:43.552 --> 05:44.636
Let's say you're right.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.099
We head over there,
you start screaming and shouting.

05:50.392 --> 05:51.476
What happens to him?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.027
No, of course.

06:02.404 --> 06:03.405
You're right.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.159
I'll head over there tomorrow,
make some inquiries.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.829
But for now, we should just stay put.

06:22.508 --> 06:23.717
It's just a house.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.678
Nine bedrooms.
That is not a house. It's a barracks.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.889
It's the perfect place to build
and train an army.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.933
The neighbor says
he thinks they're out of town.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.184
The neighbor?

06:32.267 --> 06:35.604
You never trust the neighbor because every
time they find a basement full of bodies,

06:35.687 --> 06:37.981
it's always,
"The neighbor suspected nothing."

06:38.065 --> 06:39.358
Hold on. There's movement.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.326
What is it? Groceries?

06:49.826 --> 06:51.995
Yeah, it's delivery.

06:54.289 --> 06:57.167
Which means they're home,
and they have hungry mouths to feed.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.045
What do you want me to do?

07:04.716 --> 07:05.717
Come home.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.344
Burgers.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.764
Burgers don't travel well. Sushi. We could
get beautiful fish here in an hour.

07:10.848 --> 07:13.475
Guys, let's keep it simple
and just go with pizza.

07:13.559 --> 07:15.352
Marino. It's Italian after all.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.062
I don't wanna open a fuckin' pizza parlor.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.355
You're not opening anything.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.191
You're just writing a menu
so we can get buzzed inside the gate.

07:21.275 --> 07:24.862
Cheezus Crust. Get it?

07:25.821 --> 07:28.615
-What? Religion doesn't sell?
-Why aren't you typing?

07:29.241 --> 07:30.868
"The most authentic pies in Philly."

07:30.951 --> 07:32.578
"From God's oven to your lips."

07:32.661 --> 07:34.288
-And gluten-free available on request.
-Hold on.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.539
Move over. I'll do it.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.148
Slowly, slowly. Slowly, work it.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.442
Yeah. Yeah.

08:04.610 --> 08:05.986
That's good.

08:25.047 --> 08:28.592
Congratulations. We're officially
in the carb delivery business.

08:29.218 --> 08:30.552
This had better work.

08:30.636 --> 08:32.386
Those are good pies at competitive prices.

08:32.471 --> 08:34.597
If they're in there,
they'll place an order.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.267
Drop some more menus at the
neighboring houses before you come back.

08:37.351 --> 08:38.393
Why?

08:38.477 --> 08:40.270
So it doesn't look suspicious.

08:43.315 --> 08:44.525
Now what?

08:44.608 --> 08:46.485
Nothing. We wait.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.075
Now, if you're a regular viewer,

08:53.158 --> 08:56.995
you may have noticed that our own
Dorothy Turner has not graced our screens

08:57.079 --> 08:58.497
for the past couple of weeks.

08:58.872 --> 09:03.377
That's because of a medical emergency that
has her under doctor's orders to rest up.

09:03.460 --> 09:08.465
But joining us now live by telephone
is our own Dorothy Turner.

09:08.549 --> 09:09.550
Dorothy, good evening.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.218
Good evening, Walker.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.761
So, how you feeling, Dorothy?

09:13.637 --> 09:16.515
It was quite a scare, I can tell you that.

09:16.598 --> 09:19.726
But the medical staff was amazing,

09:19.810 --> 09:23.814
and I am taking their wise advice
to rest up before the birth.

09:24.273 --> 09:26.775
And that's gotta be tough
because you're always so active.

09:26.859 --> 09:32.072
Yes, well, sometimes in life
we have to just put our feet up

09:32.155 --> 09:34.533
and accept that nature knows best.

09:34.616 --> 09:37.327
Listen, we're all wishing you
a very speedy recovery, Dorothy.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.787
Thank you, Walker.

09:38.871 --> 09:43.792
And a special thank you to all the viewers
out there who sent cards and flowers.

09:43.876 --> 09:49.131
My husband and I were just so touched.
So, God bless you all.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.231
Fuck, I'm right here.
You can call my name.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.859
-Did you record that?
-Yeah.

10:09.651 --> 10:12.112
-I wanna see.
-You're not going anywhere.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.449
It's been two weeks. I feel fine.

10:15.532 --> 10:18.744
I didn't just wipe your ass
a thousand times for you to give up now.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.205
You could carry me down.

10:21.288 --> 10:24.416
You heard what the doctor said.
As long as my feet don't touch the ground.

10:25.083 --> 10:28.128
Captain Clumsy here?
You said you had this.

10:28.212 --> 10:31.048
But if you want, I can call the hospital.
They got a bed waiting.

10:32.633 --> 10:33.634
You're a bully.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.640
I'm out of calamari.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.391
I'll make you some more tomorrow.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.227
I want more now.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.312
Do you have any idea
how long the batter takes?

10:45.395 --> 10:47.147
I mean, the flour's in Amsterdam.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.111
Why can't you just be a normal person
and do nothing?

11:11.380 --> 11:12.548
Sean?

11:15.801 --> 11:17.594
Cheezus Crust, can I take your order?

11:23.475 --> 11:25.477
And can I take your address, please?

11:27.563 --> 11:29.481
1406 Hyacinth.

11:30.816 --> 11:33.068
Yeah, we'll be an hour. Thank you.

11:37.990 --> 11:39.324
You're charging too much.

11:39.408 --> 11:43.537
It's costing us $30
to produce every $13 pie.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.455
Then why haven't they placed an order yet?

11:45.539 --> 11:47.708
I don't know!
But the neighbors all love it.

11:49.668 --> 11:54.423
Fungo e tartufo. Porcinis, truffle oil,
heavy on the burrata.

11:54.506 --> 11:55.507
Yes, Chef.

11:56.842 --> 11:57.843
-Hey, Chef?
-Yeah?

11:58.343 --> 12:00.053
Why are we getting into the takeaway game?

12:00.137 --> 12:01.221
I wanted the challenge.

12:01.305 --> 12:02.973
Yeah, but pizza?

12:03.974 --> 12:05.642
You ever eat pizza with someone you love?

12:05.976 --> 12:07.519
I've had dates that end in pizza.

12:08.020 --> 12:10.355
Right. Pizza's made to be shared.

12:10.439 --> 12:14.401
Way back when, all food was,
but the pack feeds together.

12:15.569 --> 12:16.737
We break bread.

12:23.535 --> 12:24.536
Sean?

12:33.045 --> 12:35.172
Yes, Cheezus Christ-- Crust.

12:39.343 --> 12:40.385
Where are you?

12:44.806 --> 12:46.266
We're in.

12:52.481 --> 12:55.776
Is it ready? I'm illegally parked
in that fucking bike lane they painted.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.487
He's been fannying around with basil
for the last 20 minutes.

12:58.570 --> 13:02.115
If they cancel this order, I am gonna
fucking kill him. What are you wearing?

13:02.199 --> 13:04.034
I was at the opera. I have a life.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.787
-Natalie hates the opera.
-Good for her.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.872
You can't deliver pizza in tails.

13:08.956 --> 13:09.998
Sean!

13:10.582 --> 13:12.251
Are you sure it's them?

13:12.334 --> 13:15.379
Twenty cheese pizzas. There's a horde
of hungry people in that house.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.381
Not one of them
has a lick of individuality.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.842
I got six more on the way.
We've only got one oven.

13:20.175 --> 13:21.885
What the fuck are you wearing?

13:22.386 --> 13:24.805
They're never gonna believe
he's delivering food.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.640
We're gonna have to send Tobe.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.183
-Tobe?
-Gimpy?

13:33.772 --> 13:35.816
It's just a regular delivery.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.193
With the added excitement
we will be right there with ya.

13:38.277 --> 13:40.863
Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is in violation
of my employee rights.

13:40.946 --> 13:43.657
Yeah, how about you stop bitching
for two minutes and accept a cash tip?

13:52.416 --> 13:54.418
What the fuck are we gonna do
if it's them?

13:55.252 --> 13:57.421
No matter what, we keep Dorothy here.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.351
Sean!

14:14.021 --> 14:15.022
Honey?

14:32.414 --> 14:34.583
It's 9780 Spruce Street.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.671
I can't.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.466
I can't leave the bed.

15:13.455 --> 15:14.456
Is he there yet?

15:14.540 --> 15:15.832
It's moments away.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.939
What's taking so long?
Why aren't they answering?

15:41.984 --> 15:43.861
-Yeah?
-Yeah, pizza.

15:51.493 --> 15:52.703
It's opening.

15:58.876 --> 16:00.169
Is this corked?

16:01.044 --> 16:02.045
I can't taste.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.173
The least you could do is change it.

16:04.256 --> 16:06.758
-You fucking change it.
-Okay.

16:47.299 --> 16:48.717
Did I miss anything?

17:09.070 --> 17:10.071
Hello.

17:16.537 --> 17:19.330
-Hey.
-Thanks.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.916
Yeah, there's more pizzas in the car.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.128
Hey.

17:28.757 --> 17:30.509
Are they all children?

17:34.596 --> 17:36.265
Hey, I need paying.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.725
Oh, they're upstairs.

17:39.810 --> 17:41.311
It's just a party?

17:42.312 --> 17:44.064
-It's just a kids' party.
-Where's he going?

17:44.147 --> 17:45.858
I'm call him, tell him to come home.

17:45.941 --> 17:47.025
Wait.

18:11.842 --> 18:12.885
Leanne?

18:15.679 --> 18:17.431
I found you.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.101
Why are you here?

18:21.185 --> 18:23.562
You guys ordered pizza.

18:23.645 --> 18:24.646
In here.

18:30.319 --> 18:34.865
No. No, no, no, no. Follow her.
You follow Leanne!

18:50.672 --> 18:53.425
I'm sorry. They sent me up here for money.

18:59.806 --> 19:00.807
Here.

19:02.684 --> 19:05.103
Right, yeah. Sorry.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.866
My husband was reading to me.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.161
He's exhausted.

19:24.248 --> 19:25.457
We're wasting time!

19:26.708 --> 19:28.001
-Stop her!
-Just--

19:28.085 --> 19:30.379
-Dorothy, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
-No.

19:30.462 --> 19:33.298
-Dorothy, wait. Wait, wait.
-Move aside!

19:33.382 --> 19:35.634
You can't just burst in there
like a tornado.

19:35.717 --> 19:36.885
She could have Jericho!

19:36.969 --> 19:38.428
But she doesn't!

19:38.512 --> 19:41.306
Leanne took a job with a family
that is overwhelmed.

19:41.390 --> 19:44.393
Do you think they want a baby in there
with that woman in that condition?

19:44.476 --> 19:47.646
I don't know. I don't know. But I can't--

19:49.147 --> 19:51.817
Don't tell me to just sit here
and do nothing!

19:51.900 --> 19:53.902
You found Leanne.

19:54.903 --> 19:57.197
Now we have to strategize.

19:57.281 --> 19:59.241
We have to be cautious.

20:00.284 --> 20:04.955
We need her to bring Jericho to us. Right?

20:10.627 --> 20:12.880
That poor woman. Do you think it's cancer?

20:14.047 --> 20:15.799
Do I look like a fucking oncologist?

20:15.883 --> 20:17.718
And why didn't you tell me
Leanne was here?

20:17.801 --> 20:20.304
We couldn't be certain. Until now.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.055
You sent me to spy on her, didn't you?

20:22.139 --> 20:24.683
Mission accomplished.
Welcome to the CI-fucking-A.

20:24.766 --> 20:25.767
Hey.

20:43.577 --> 20:45.245
They just ordered another pie.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.294
One margherita.

20:56.590 --> 20:58.091
Leanne's panicking.

20:58.175 --> 21:00.928
Okay, she doesn't want Tobe
running back here saying he saw her.

21:02.387 --> 21:03.680
Well, should I deliver it?

21:04.264 --> 21:06.767
-Talk to her?
-Right now, she doesn't know what we know.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.061
So, until we have something
that resembles a fucking plan,

21:09.144 --> 21:11.647
let's just... keep it that way.

21:13.190 --> 21:14.733
You okay? You look like shit.

21:15.484 --> 21:18.070
-I'm fucking grand.
-How's Natalie?

21:18.153 --> 21:22.282
Oh, my God. Natalie, Natalie, Natalie.
Everyone keeps fucking on about Natalie.

21:23.075 --> 21:25.118
I've literally never mentioned Natalie.

21:25.202 --> 21:27.037
I have no idea how she is.

21:32.251 --> 21:33.752
You think she's okay?

21:34.419 --> 21:36.839
You wanna go out there
and make it yourself, don't you?

21:37.589 --> 21:41.176
She wants to be involved. She wants
to feel like she's doing something. So...

22:10.789 --> 22:11.790
Come in.

22:22.676 --> 22:23.719
Will you join me?

22:31.935 --> 22:33.687
What are you doing here, Leanne?

22:37.274 --> 22:38.734
I wanted to say goodbye.

22:40.485 --> 22:43.071
But I thought that you would try
and talk me out of leaving.

22:45.365 --> 22:47.284
Would you have listened to me?

22:51.788 --> 22:52.789
Maybe.

22:55.167 --> 22:56.251
But I had to go.

22:57.836 --> 22:59.254
I didn't have a choice.

22:59.338 --> 23:02.549
Did something happen with the Turners?

23:06.428 --> 23:07.638
It was Dorothy.

23:10.224 --> 23:12.351
I couldn't live with her for another day.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.019
I've heard enough of this.

23:14.102 --> 23:15.103
Leave it.

23:15.771 --> 23:17.940
She's not like she is on the television.

23:18.607 --> 23:21.193
She's selfish, and she's cruel.

23:22.528 --> 23:23.654
She's mean.

23:25.822 --> 23:28.158
-Dorothy.
-I just need a minute.

23:29.117 --> 23:30.827
Call me if anything happens.

25:10.302 --> 25:13.805
You came all the way down?
Why didn't you call?

25:18.185 --> 25:19.728
Don't worry. I handled it.

25:25.984 --> 25:27.069
She didn't mean that.

25:27.569 --> 25:28.820
I get it all the time.

25:28.904 --> 25:31.657
People wanting to be my friend,
but I don't have space for them.

25:31.740 --> 25:34.117
They get jealous, petty. It's nothing new.

25:36.078 --> 25:37.079
Let me help.

25:41.166 --> 25:42.584
I can do it myself.

25:51.051 --> 25:52.761
About how much longer do you think?

25:52.845 --> 25:53.887
Ninety seconds.

25:55.305 --> 25:56.515
Great.

25:57.224 --> 25:59.351
Be a dear and bring it through
when it's done.

26:15.701 --> 26:18.412
I'm sure they'd let you back.
If you wanted.

26:21.665 --> 26:23.792
Mrs. Marino treats me very well here.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.505
What about Jericho? Bet he misses you.

26:32.050 --> 26:33.886
You mustn't tell them that I'm here.

26:35.888 --> 26:37.055
Promise me.

26:41.101 --> 26:42.102
Tobe?

26:43.103 --> 26:46.190
Look, they were just worried about you.

26:55.073 --> 26:56.658
What have you done?

27:02.372 --> 27:03.457
Hey. I-- I-- I--

27:05.959 --> 27:07.002
What's wrong?

27:08.086 --> 27:09.630
I stood up too fast.

27:09.713 --> 27:10.714
Leanne?

27:10.797 --> 27:13.008
Leanne? Leanne?

27:14.176 --> 27:15.469
Leanne?

27:16.345 --> 27:18.263
-Leanne!
-Take me off mute.

27:21.683 --> 27:25.020
-Okay--
-Tobe. Can you hear me?

27:25.604 --> 27:29.942
Yeah. She just collapsed,
Ms. T. I gotta call 911.

27:30.025 --> 27:31.735
I wouldn't recommend that.

27:32.319 --> 27:36.281
You've just entered a private residence
and drugged a young woman with pizza.

27:38.033 --> 27:39.034
What?

27:41.119 --> 27:42.913
This is what I want you to do.

27:43.956 --> 27:47.376
Pick her up off the floor,
put her in the back seat of your car,

27:48.252 --> 27:49.461
and drive her here.

27:50.879 --> 27:54.424
If you don't do that,
I'll call 911 myself.

27:54.508 --> 27:55.551
But--

28:01.932 --> 28:04.434
Don't worry. I handled it.

28:17.406 --> 28:18.407
Slice.
