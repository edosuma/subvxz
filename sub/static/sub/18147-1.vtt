00:55.120 --> 00:56.690
In the beginning...

00:56.840 --> 00:59.684
there was only ocean...

00:59.840 --> 01:03.811
until the mother island emerged.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.809
Te Fiti.

01:06.440 --> 01:10.206
Her heart held the greatest power
ever known.

01:10.360 --> 01:13.330
It could create life itself.

01:13.480 --> 01:17.724
And Te Fiti shared it with the world.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.366
But in time...

01:21.560 --> 01:24.564
some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.848
They believed if they could possess it...

01:27.000 --> 01:30.641
the great power of creation
would be theirs.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.167
And one day...

01:33.720 --> 01:36.326
the most daring of them all...

01:36.480 --> 01:40.849
voyaged across the vast ocean to take it.

01:42.160 --> 01:47.041
He was a demigod of the wind and sea.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.084
He was a warrior.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.565
A trickster.

01:55.040 --> 01:58.123
A shapeshifter who could change form...

01:58.280 --> 02:01.045
with the power of his magical fish hook.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.166
And his name...

02:05.200 --> 02:07.202
was Maui.

02:17.040 --> 02:21.364
But without her heart,
Te Fiti began to crumble...

02:21.680 --> 02:24.160
giving birth to a terrible darkness.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.002
Maui tried to escape...

02:45.160 --> 02:48.846
but was confronted by another
who sought the heart.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.250
Te Kā!

02:52.640 --> 02:55.450
A demon of earth and fire.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.085
Maui was struck from the sky...

03:07.360 --> 03:09.681
never to be seen again.

03:10.280 --> 03:14.968
And his magical fish hook
and the heart of Te Fiti...

03:15.120 --> 03:17.930
were lost to the sea.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.251
Where, even now...

03:20.400 --> 03:22.368
1,000 years later...

03:22.520 --> 03:25.126
Te Kā and the demons of the deep...

03:25.280 --> 03:27.123
still hunt for the heart.

03:27.720 --> 03:31.645
Hiding in a darkness
that will continue to spread...

03:32.040 --> 03:34.247
chasing away our fish...

03:34.440 --> 03:37.489
draining the life
from island after island...

03:37.840 --> 03:41.049
until every one of us is devoured...

03:41.240 --> 03:43.891
by the bloodthirsty jaws...

03:44.040 --> 03:46.646
of inescapable death!

03:52.200 --> 03:53.645
But one day...

03:53.800 --> 03:55.643
the heart will be found...

03:56.080 --> 03:59.084
by someone who will journey
beyond our reef...

03:59.240 --> 04:00.446
find Maui...

04:00.840 --> 04:02.842
deliver him across the great ocean...

04:03.000 --> 04:05.162
to restore Te Fiti's heart...

04:05.480 --> 04:07.369
and save us all.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.570
Thank you, Mother. That's enough.

04:09.880 --> 04:10.608
Papa.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.683
No one goes outside the reef.

04:12.840 --> 04:15.923
We are safe here.
There is no darkness.

04:16.079 --> 04:17.844
There are no monsters.

04:20.800 --> 04:21.687
Monsters!

04:22.000 --> 04:23.843
- There's no monsters, no monsters...
- It's the darkness!

04:24.520 --> 04:28.206
No, there is nothing beyond our reef,
but storms and rough seas.

04:28.360 --> 04:29.486
I'm gonna throw up.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.484
As long as we stay
on our very safe island...

04:32.640 --> 04:33.801
...we'll be fine.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.360
The legends are true.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.205
Someone will have to go.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.363
Mother, Motunui is paradise.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.371
Who would want to go anywhere else?

05:18.680 --> 05:20.728
Shoo, shoo!

07:01.560 --> 07:02.721
Moana!

07:18.120 --> 07:20.691
There you are, Moana.
What are you doing? You scared me.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.530
What? I wanna's go back.

07:22.840 --> 07:26.162
I know, I know.
But you don't go out there.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.321
It's dangerous.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.521
Moana, come on.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.563
Let's go back to the village.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.762
You are the next great chief
of our people.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.924
And you will do wondrous things,
my little minnow.

07:41.640 --> 07:45.281
Oh, yes. But first, you must learn
where you're meant to be.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.324
Moana

07:59.480 --> 08:01.847
Make way, make way

08:02.040 --> 08:03.929
Moana, it's time you knew

08:04.080 --> 08:07.721
The village of Motunui is all you need

08:08.080 --> 08:09.923
The dancers are practicing

08:10.280 --> 08:12.521
They dance to an ancient song

08:12.920 --> 08:15.571
Who needs a new song
This old one's all we need

08:15.920 --> 08:17.649
This tradition is our mission

08:17.800 --> 08:20.406
And Moana, there's so much to do

08:20.760 --> 08:21.966
Don't trip on the taro root

08:22.120 --> 08:24.248
That's all you need

08:24.600 --> 08:26.409
We share everything we make

08:26.560 --> 08:28.449
We joke and we weave our baskets

08:28.760 --> 08:30.762
The fishermen come back from the sea

08:31.080 --> 08:32.570
I wanna see

08:32.720 --> 08:34.448
Don't walk away

08:34.799 --> 08:36.404
Moana, stay on the ground now

08:36.760 --> 08:38.443
Our people will need a chief

08:38.799 --> 08:40.484
- And there you are
- There you are

08:40.840 --> 08:42.729
There comes a day

08:42.880 --> 08:46.601
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is

08:46.960 --> 08:48.450
Where you are

08:48.880 --> 08:50.370
Consider the coconut

08:50.680 --> 08:52.648
- The what
- Consider its tree

08:52.840 --> 08:56.128
We use each part of the coconut
It's all we need

08:56.960 --> 08:58.883
We make our nets from the fibers

08:59.240 --> 09:00.844
The water is sweet inside

09:01.200 --> 09:05.125
We use the leaves to build fires
We cook up the meat inside

09:05.520 --> 09:07.124
Consider the coconuts

09:07.280 --> 09:08.884
The trunks and the leaves

09:09.200 --> 09:11.567
The island gives us what we need

09:11.880 --> 09:13.644
And no one leaves

09:13.960 --> 09:15.291
That's right, we stay

09:15.440 --> 09:17.010
We're safe and we're well-provided

09:17.400 --> 09:19.129
And when we look to the future

09:19.480 --> 09:21.403
There you are

09:21.520 --> 09:23.648
You'll be okay

09:24.000 --> 09:25.604
In time you'll learn just as I did

09:25.760 --> 09:29.321
You must find happiness
right where you are

09:35.720 --> 09:40.009
I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves

09:40.160 --> 09:44.165
The water is mischievous
Ha! I like how it misbehaves

09:44.320 --> 09:48.166
The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far

09:48.560 --> 09:52.929
But once you know what you like
Well, there you are

09:54.840 --> 09:58.970
You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride

09:59.160 --> 10:03.370
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside

10:03.720 --> 10:07.691
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star

10:08.120 --> 10:12.648
Moana, that voice inside is who you are

10:15.560 --> 10:16.607
Dad!

10:16.800 --> 10:20.009
I was only looking at the boats.
I wasn't gonna get on 'em.

10:23.880 --> 10:27.487
Come on.
There's something I need to show you.

10:29.520 --> 10:32.842
I've wanted to bring you here from
the moment you opened your eyes.

10:33.480 --> 10:35.528
This is a sacred place.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.729
A place of chiefs.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.570
There will come a time...

10:39.720 --> 10:44.601
when you will stand on this peak
and place a stone on this mountain.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.406
Like I did. Like my father did.

10:47.560 --> 10:51.406
And his father, and every chief
that has ever been.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.685
And on that day...

10:54.080 --> 10:55.969
when you add your stone...

10:56.320 --> 10:59.642
you will raise this whole island higher.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.851
You are the future of our people, Moana.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.571
And they are not out there.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.530
They are right here.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.924
It's time to be who they need you to be.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.160
- We make our nets from the fibers
- We weave our nets from the fibers

11:16.240 --> 11:17.560
- The water is sweet inside
- A real tasty treat inside

11:17.640 --> 11:19.802
- We use the leaves to build fires
- We sing these songs in our choirs

11:20.240 --> 11:21.810
- To cook up the meat inside
- We have mouths to feed inside

11:22.160 --> 11:23.924
- The village believes in us
- That's right

11:24.120 --> 11:25.610
The village believes

11:25.920 --> 11:27.922
The island gives us what we need

11:28.120 --> 11:30.088
And no one leaves

11:30.440 --> 11:31.601
So here I'll stay

11:31.960 --> 11:35.601
My home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow

11:35.760 --> 11:37.842
There we are

11:38.240 --> 11:39.810
I'll lead the way

11:40.120 --> 11:41.963
I'll have my people to guide me

11:42.120 --> 11:43.770
We'll build our future together

11:43.920 --> 11:45.968
Where we are

11:46.280 --> 11:47.850
'Cause every path leads ya back to

11:48.240 --> 11:49.446
Where you are

11:50.040 --> 11:51.929
You can find happiness right

11:52.320 --> 11:53.970
Where you are

11:54.280 --> 11:57.124
Where you are

12:00.920 --> 12:04.481
And every storm, this roof leaks,
no matter how many fronds I add.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.482
Fixed!

12:05.800 --> 12:06.926
Not the fronds.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.645
Wind shifted the post.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.924
That's good pork!

12:16.640 --> 12:18.483
I didn't mean... I wasn't...

12:18.640 --> 12:22.645
What? They're calling me, so I gotta...
Bye!

12:25.400 --> 12:26.686
You're doing great.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.251
Is it done yet?

12:30.160 --> 12:31.764
So close.

12:46.240 --> 12:49.562
I'm curious about that chicken
eating the rock.

12:49.680 --> 12:54.641
He seems to lack the basic intelligence
required for pretty much everything.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.724
Should we maybe just cook him?

12:58.880 --> 13:02.123
Sometimes our strengths lie
beneath the surface.

13:03.640 --> 13:06.007
Far beneath in some cases.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.642
But I'm sure there's more to Heihei
than meets the eye.

13:16.680 --> 13:17.761
It's the harvest.

13:18.120 --> 13:21.329
This morning,
I was husking the coconuts and...

13:28.080 --> 13:29.127
Well...

13:29.240 --> 13:34.160
we should clear the diseased trees
and we will start a new grove.

13:34.240 --> 13:35.241
There.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.046
Thanks, Moana.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.202
She's doing great.

13:45.280 --> 13:46.566
This suits you.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.761
Chief?

13:48.920 --> 13:50.604
There's something you need to see.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.610
Our traps in the east lagoon...

13:53.000 --> 13:54.968
they're pulling up less and less fish.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.767
Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.

13:58.120 --> 14:00.088
We have. There's no fish.

14:00.280 --> 14:03.443
Oh. Then we'll fish
the far side of the island.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.487
We tried.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.086
The windward side.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.767
And the leeward side, the shallows,
the channel.

14:09.160 --> 14:10.605
We've tried the whole lagoon.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.122
They're just gone.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.409
Have you tried using a different bait?

14:15.560 --> 14:16.971
I don't think it's the bait.

14:17.320 --> 14:18.606
There's no fish.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.485
It seems like
it's getting worse and worse.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.604
Of course, I understand
you have reason for concern.

14:24.520 --> 14:25.851
I will talk to the council.
I'm sure we...

14:26.000 --> 14:28.890
What if we fish beyond the reef?

14:30.280 --> 14:32.123
No one goes beyond the reef.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.760
I know. But if there are no fish
in the lagoon...

14:35.120 --> 14:36.849
- Moana.
- And there's a whole ocean.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.645
We have one rule.

14:39.040 --> 14:39.962
An old rule, when there were fish.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.084
- A rule that keeps us safe...
- But Dad, I...

14:42.200 --> 14:46.171
...instead of endangering our people
so you can run right back to the water.

14:52.840 --> 14:55.411
Every time I think you're past this...

14:58.040 --> 15:00.281
No one goes beyond the reef!

15:06.920 --> 15:10.003
Well, it's not like you said it
in front of your dad.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.170
Standing on a boat.

15:12.920 --> 15:17.164
I didn't say go beyond the reef,
because I want to be on the ocean.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.322
But you still do.

15:20.760 --> 15:23.206
- He's hard on you because...
- Because he doesn't get me.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.971
Because he was you.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.649
Drawn to the ocean.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.165
Down by the shore.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.964
He took a canoe, Moana.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.600
He crossed the reef...

15:35.560 --> 15:37.847
and found an unforgiving sea.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.084
Waves like mountains.

15:41.120 --> 15:44.363
His best friend begged to be on that boat.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.121
Your dad couldn't save him.

15:49.240 --> 15:52.528
He's hoping he can save you.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.370
Sometimes...

15:55.520 --> 15:59.445
who we wish we were,
what we wish we could do...

16:01.120 --> 16:03.248
it's just not meant to be.

16:17.160 --> 16:21.404
I've been staring at the edge of the water

16:21.560 --> 16:24.723
Long as I can remember

16:25.080 --> 16:27.845
Never really knowing why

16:29.240 --> 16:33.564
I wish I could be the perfect daughter

16:33.760 --> 16:36.570
But I come back to the water

16:36.760 --> 16:38.967
No matter how hard I try

16:40.760 --> 16:44.003
Every turn I take
Every trail I track

16:44.520 --> 16:47.046
Every path I make
Every road leads back

16:47.440 --> 16:49.761
To the place I know
Where I cannot go

16:49.920 --> 16:52.366
Where I long to be

16:52.520 --> 16:55.000
See the line where the sky meets the sea

16:55.400 --> 16:57.448
It calls me

16:57.600 --> 17:00.444
And no one knows

17:00.920 --> 17:03.446
How far it goes

17:03.960 --> 17:08.727
If the wind in my sail on the sea
Stays behind me

17:08.839 --> 17:12.446
One day I'll know

17:12.599 --> 17:16.844
If I go, there's just no telling
how far I'll go

17:17.160 --> 17:20.050
I know everybody on this island

17:20.359 --> 17:22.806
Seems so happy on this island

17:22.960 --> 17:25.531
Everything is by design

17:27.520 --> 17:31.002
I know everybody on this island

17:31.400 --> 17:34.244
Has a role on this island

17:34.600 --> 17:36.967
So maybe I can roll with mine

17:38.320 --> 17:41.210
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong

17:41.520 --> 17:43.887
I'll be satisfied
If I play along

17:44.080 --> 17:47.323
But the voice inside
Sings a different song

17:47.640 --> 17:49.369
What is wrong with me

17:52.520 --> 17:55.126
See the light as it shines on the sea

17:55.280 --> 17:57.931
It's blinding

17:58.320 --> 18:00.209
But no one knows

18:00.640 --> 18:03.849
How deep it goes

18:04.000 --> 18:06.082
And it seems like it's calling out to me

18:06.480 --> 18:09.051
So come find me

18:09.440 --> 18:11.761
And let me know

18:12.480 --> 18:15.404
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line

18:15.760 --> 18:17.603
The line where the sky meets the sea

18:17.960 --> 18:20.531
It calls me

18:20.680 --> 18:23.331
And no one knows

18:23.480 --> 18:26.723
How far it goes

18:27.160 --> 18:31.688
If the wind in my sail on the sea
stays behind me

18:31.880 --> 18:34.531
One day I'll know

18:34.680 --> 18:40.005
How far I'll go

18:42.720 --> 18:43.721
Whoa.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.886
We're okay, Pua.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.600
I can do this.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.885
There's more fish beyond the reef.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.807
There's more beyond the reef.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.690
Not so bad.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.248
Pua!

20:09.960 --> 20:12.804
Whatever just happened...

20:12.960 --> 20:14.246
blame it on the pig.

20:14.640 --> 20:15.527
Gramma.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.130
Are you gonna tell Dad?

20:22.480 --> 20:25.723
I'm his mom.
I don't have to tell him anything.

20:29.440 --> 20:30.726
He was right.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.482
About going out there.

20:35.920 --> 20:39.003
It's time to put my stone on the mountain.

20:41.160 --> 20:44.164
Okay.
Well, then, head on back.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.684
Put that stone up there.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.284
Why aren't you trying
to talk me out of it?

20:53.760 --> 20:56.127
You said that's what you wanted.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.081
It is.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.842
When I die...

21:04.320 --> 21:07.529
I'm going to come back as one of these.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.810
Or I chose the wrong tattoo.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.644
Why are you acting weird?

21:13.040 --> 21:16.328
I'm the village crazy lady.
That's my job.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.641
If there's something you want to tell me,
just tell me!

21:21.840 --> 21:23.649
Is there something you wanna tell me?

21:24.120 --> 21:27.044
Is there something you want to hear?

21:31.880 --> 21:34.884
You've been told
all our people's stories...

21:35.720 --> 21:37.404
but one.

21:38.320 --> 21:39.845
What is this place?

21:40.280 --> 21:44.490
Do you really think
our ancestors stayed within the reef?

21:56.160 --> 21:57.810
What's in there?

21:58.000 --> 22:02.483
The answer to the question
you keep asking yourself.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.651
Who are you meant to be?

22:08.920 --> 22:10.684
Go inside...

22:10.840 --> 22:12.410
bang the drum...

22:12.920 --> 22:14.888
and find out.

22:44.160 --> 22:44.968
Whoa.

22:51.040 --> 22:51.882
Oh.

23:23.560 --> 23:25.005
Bang the drum.

24:56.760 --> 24:59.650
We read the wind and the sky

25:00.000 --> 25:01.650
When the sun is high

25:01.800 --> 25:04.610
We sail the length of the seas

25:05.120 --> 25:06.451
On the ocean breeze

25:06.920 --> 25:09.127
At night we name every star

25:09.480 --> 25:11.448
We know where we are

25:11.840 --> 25:15.811
We know who we are
Who we are

25:18.800 --> 25:20.768
We set a course to find

25:21.200 --> 25:25.489
A brand new island everywhere we roam

25:28.360 --> 25:30.249
We keep our island in our mind

25:30.960 --> 25:33.406
And when it's time to find home

25:33.560 --> 25:35.449
We know the way

25:37.120 --> 25:40.442
We are explorers reading every sign

25:40.880 --> 25:45.647
We tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chain

25:52.960 --> 25:55.850
We know the way

26:01.640 --> 26:03.449
We were voyagers.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.686
We were voyagers!

26:06.160 --> 26:09.721
We were voyagers!
We were voyagers!

26:09.920 --> 26:11.649
We were voyagers!

26:13.160 --> 26:14.605
Why'd we stop?

26:15.680 --> 26:16.806
Maui.

26:17.400 --> 26:21.007
When he stole from the mother island,
darkness fell.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.484
Te Kā awoke.

26:24.160 --> 26:27.403
Monsters lurked
and boats stopped coming back.

26:28.160 --> 26:31.840
To protect our people,
the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging...

26:31.920 --> 26:35.845
and now we have forgotten who we are.

26:36.080 --> 26:39.926
And the darkness
has continued to spread...

26:40.440 --> 26:42.204
chasing away our fish...

26:42.560 --> 26:44.130
draining the life...

26:44.520 --> 26:47.888
from island after island.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.123
Our island.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.563
But, one day...

26:55.720 --> 26:59.850
someone will journey beyond our reef,
find Maui...

27:00.000 --> 27:02.924
deliver him across the great ocean...

27:03.840 --> 27:07.447
to restore the heart of Te Fiti.

27:09.120 --> 27:12.203
I was there that day.

27:12.400 --> 27:15.210
The ocean chose you.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.128
I thought it was a dream.

27:32.160 --> 27:33.764
Nope!

27:34.680 --> 27:38.446
Our ancestors believed Maui lies there...

27:38.600 --> 27:40.364
at the bottom of his hook.

27:40.840 --> 27:43.650
Follow it, and you will find him.

27:43.800 --> 27:47.247
But why would it choose me?

27:47.400 --> 27:50.483
I don't even know
how to make it past the reef.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.248
But I know who does!

28:02.960 --> 28:04.405
- The crops are turning black.
- What about the fish?

28:04.760 --> 28:06.360
This is happening all over the island.

28:06.440 --> 28:07.880
- Please, please settle down.
- What are you going to do?

28:07.960 --> 28:09.800
We will dig new fields.
We will find a way to...

28:09.880 --> 28:12.406
We can stop the darkness!
Save our island!

28:12.760 --> 28:14.125
There's a cavern of boats.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.811
Huge canoes.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.561
We can take them, find Maui,
make him restore the heart.

28:20.040 --> 28:23.203
We were voyagers.
We can voyage again!

28:26.280 --> 28:28.044
You told me to help our people.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.441
This is how we help our people.

28:31.000 --> 28:31.960
Dad?

28:32.040 --> 28:32.962
What are you doing?

28:33.320 --> 28:35.641
I should've burned those boats
a long time ago!

28:35.800 --> 28:36.847
No! Don't!

28:37.000 --> 28:39.571
We have to find Maui.
We have to restore the heart!

28:39.960 --> 28:40.927
There is no heart!

28:41.120 --> 28:43.043
This is just a rock!

28:43.240 --> 28:43.968
No!

28:57.400 --> 28:59.482
Chief! It's your mother!

29:09.960 --> 29:11.166
Mother...

29:27.280 --> 29:28.805
What can be done?

29:34.960 --> 29:36.121
Go.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.010
Gramma.

29:40.760 --> 29:41.727
Go.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.726
Not now. I can't.

29:45.120 --> 29:46.201
You must!

29:46.600 --> 29:49.763
The ocean chose you.

29:50.160 --> 29:51.400
Follow the fish hook.

29:51.600 --> 29:52.601
Gramma...

29:52.760 --> 29:54.842
And when you find Maui...

29:55.280 --> 29:58.841
you grab him by the ear.
You say...

29:59.240 --> 30:02.244
"I am Moana of Motunui.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.848
"You will board my boat...

30:05.320 --> 30:07.402
"sail across the sea...

30:07.560 --> 30:11.565
"and restore the heart of Te Fiti."

30:13.440 --> 30:15.727
I can't leave you.

30:16.200 --> 30:21.411
There is nowhere you could go
that I won't be with you.

30:34.360 --> 30:35.771
Go!

30:47.640 --> 30:50.405
There's a line where the sky meets the sea

30:50.760 --> 30:52.410
And it calls me

30:53.160 --> 30:55.481
But no one knows

30:55.640 --> 30:59.326
How far it goes

30:59.760 --> 31:04.448
All that time wondering where I need to be
Is behind me

31:04.880 --> 31:07.565
I'm on my own

31:08.200 --> 31:10.601
To worlds unknown

31:11.000 --> 31:13.844
Every turn I take
Every trail I track

31:14.160 --> 31:15.720
Is a choice I make

31:15.800 --> 31:18.485
Now I can't turn back
from the great unknown

31:18.840 --> 31:22.049
Where I go alone
Where I long to be

31:31.600 --> 31:33.807
See her light up the night in the sea

31:34.200 --> 31:36.646
She calls me

31:37.040 --> 31:39.441
And yes, I know

31:39.800 --> 31:42.087
That I can go

31:43.720 --> 31:47.247
There's a moon in the sky
And the wind is behind me

31:48.680 --> 31:50.808
Soon I'll know

31:51.200 --> 31:53.407
How far I'll go

32:13.240 --> 32:17.723
I am Moana of Motunui.
You will board my boat...

32:18.240 --> 32:22.290
sail across the sea
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.010
I am Moana...

32:25.440 --> 32:26.487
of Motu...

32:28.120 --> 32:29.246
...nui.

32:40.880 --> 32:41.881
Heihei?

33:04.560 --> 33:07.450
It's okay. You're all right.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.241
See?

33:09.640 --> 33:12.450
There we go. Nice water.

33:12.600 --> 33:15.126
The ocean is a friend of mine.

33:17.320 --> 33:18.446
Heihei?

33:19.760 --> 33:20.761
Heihei!

33:35.840 --> 33:36.841
Stay.

33:42.840 --> 33:45.684
Okay. Next stop, Maui.

33:53.800 --> 33:56.371
I am Moana of Motunui.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.690
You will board my boat...

34:00.520 --> 34:03.683
sail... across the sea...

34:03.840 --> 34:05.968
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

34:07.960 --> 34:11.123
I am Moana of Motu...

34:12.199 --> 34:13.531
Board my boat!

34:16.480 --> 34:17.561
Oh, no.

34:23.840 --> 34:25.569
No, no, no!

34:37.880 --> 34:39.005
Ocean...

34:39.360 --> 34:42.091
can I get a little help?

34:45.560 --> 34:46.686
No, no.

34:48.159 --> 34:49.081
Please.

34:49.480 --> 34:50.481
Come on!

35:01.880 --> 35:03.291
Help me!

35:03.760 --> 35:04.761
Please!

35:49.880 --> 35:51.006
What?

35:51.400 --> 35:52.970
I said help me!

35:53.120 --> 35:55.282
And wrecking my boat?

35:55.720 --> 35:57.449
Not helping!

35:59.120 --> 36:02.044
Fish pee in you all day!

36:02.200 --> 36:03.326
So...

36:17.360 --> 36:18.282
Maui?

36:25.600 --> 36:26.840
Maui!

36:30.160 --> 36:32.606
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea...

36:32.760 --> 36:34.489
I am Moana of Motunui.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.210
You will board my boat.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.283
No. You will board my boat.

36:38.440 --> 36:41.205
Yeah. I am Moana of Motunui.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.126
You will board my...

36:44.280 --> 36:46.360
Boat! A boat!

36:46.440 --> 36:49.250
The gods have given me a...

37:03.560 --> 37:05.164
Maui, shapeshifter...

37:05.640 --> 37:07.483
demigod of the wind and sea...

37:07.840 --> 37:09.600
- I am Moana of...
- Hero of men.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.200
What?

37:11.280 --> 37:13.806
It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter,
demigod of the wind and sea...

37:14.000 --> 37:15.161
hero of men.

37:15.320 --> 37:18.244
I interrupted.
From the top. Hero of men. Go.

37:20.200 --> 37:21.201
I am...

37:21.360 --> 37:22.521
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

37:22.920 --> 37:25.002
And women. Men and women.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.002
Both. All.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.925
Not a guy, girl thing.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.844
You know, Maui is a hero to all.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.126
You're doing great.

37:31.560 --> 37:32.846
What? No! I'm here to...

37:33.160 --> 37:34.321
Of course.

37:34.680 --> 37:35.920
Yes, yes, yes.

37:36.520 --> 37:38.648
Maui always has time for his fans.

37:40.240 --> 37:42.208
When you use a bird to write with...

37:43.000 --> 37:44.365
it's called tweeting.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.965
I know, not every day
you get a chance to meet your hero.

37:52.240 --> 37:53.844
You are not my hero.

37:54.040 --> 37:56.566
And I'm not here so you can sign my oar!

37:56.720 --> 37:59.166
I'm here 'cause
you stole the heart of Te Fiti!

37:59.600 --> 38:01.568
And you will board my boat...

38:01.720 --> 38:04.929
and sail across the sea and put it back!

38:06.200 --> 38:09.640
Yeah, it almost sounded
like you don't like me...

38:09.720 --> 38:11.120
which is impossible because...

38:11.200 --> 38:13.080
I got stuck here for 1,000 years...

38:13.160 --> 38:15.520
trying to get the heart
as a gift for you mortals.

38:15.600 --> 38:18.649
So you could have the power
to create life itself.

38:19.400 --> 38:22.449
Yeah. So, what I believe
you were trying to say...

38:22.600 --> 38:23.487
is "thank you."

38:23.880 --> 38:25.041
- "Thank you?"
- You're welcome.

38:25.400 --> 38:26.242
What? No, no, no!

38:26.640 --> 38:27.721
I didn't... I wasn't...

38:28.080 --> 38:28.888
Why would I ever say that?

38:29.280 --> 38:30.486
Okay, okay.

38:31.040 --> 38:34.328
I see what's happening
Yeah

38:34.720 --> 38:37.405
You're face to face with greatness
and it's strange

38:37.760 --> 38:39.091
You don't even know how you feel

38:39.600 --> 38:41.125
It's adorable

38:41.400 --> 38:43.926
Well it's nice to see that humans
never change

38:44.320 --> 38:47.290
Open your eyes
Let's begin

38:47.760 --> 38:48.727
Yes, it's really me

38:49.080 --> 38:50.650
It's Maui
Breathe it in

38:51.120 --> 38:52.840
I know it's a lot

38:52.920 --> 38:54.570
The hair
The bod

38:55.400 --> 38:57.562
When you're staring at a demigod

38:58.440 --> 39:00.602
What can I say except

39:00.760 --> 39:02.285
You're welcome

39:02.640 --> 39:05.291
For the tides, the sun, the sky

39:05.680 --> 39:07.603
Hey, it's okay, it's okay

39:07.960 --> 39:09.610
You're welcome

39:09.760 --> 39:12.411
I'm just an ordinary demiguy
Hey!

39:12.880 --> 39:15.645
What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky

39:16.120 --> 39:17.929
When you were waddling yay high?

39:18.120 --> 39:19.246
This guy

39:19.400 --> 39:23.724
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below?

39:24.240 --> 39:26.129
You're looking at him yo

39:26.280 --> 39:29.966
Oh, also I lassoed the sun

39:30.400 --> 39:31.322
You're welcome

39:31.680 --> 39:33.967
To stretch your days and bring you fun

39:34.120 --> 39:36.930
Also I harnessed the breeze

39:37.320 --> 39:38.321
You're welcome

39:38.520 --> 39:40.807
To fill your sails and shake your trees

39:41.240 --> 39:44.926
So what can I say except
You're welcome

39:45.080 --> 39:47.560
For the islands I pulled from the sea

39:48.120 --> 39:50.361
There's no need to pray
It's okay

39:50.520 --> 39:51.851
You're welcome

39:51.960 --> 39:55.806
Ha, I guess it's just my way of being me

39:55.960 --> 39:56.847
You're welcome

39:57.640 --> 39:59.290
You're welcome

39:59.800 --> 40:01.040
Well come to think of it

40:01.640 --> 40:03.244
Kid, honestly I could go on and on

40:03.640 --> 40:05.130
I could explain every natural phenomenon

40:05.480 --> 40:08.484
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was Maui just messing around

40:08.960 --> 40:10.485
I killed an eel, I buried its guts

40:10.640 --> 40:12.005
Sprouted a tree
Now you got coconuts

40:12.480 --> 40:13.970
What's the lesson?
What is the take away?

40:14.320 --> 40:15.765
Don't mess with Maui
when he's on a breakaway

40:16.160 --> 40:19.164
And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win

40:19.520 --> 40:20.965
Look where I've been
I make everything happen

40:21.360 --> 40:23.328
Look at that
Mean Mini-Mauijust tickety tappin'

40:23.440 --> 40:24.930
Ha ha
Ha ha

40:25.360 --> 40:27.203
Ha ha
Hey

40:27.400 --> 40:30.480
Well anyway let me say
You're welcome

40:30.560 --> 40:31.760
You're welcome

40:31.840 --> 40:34.491
For the wonderful world you know

40:34.640 --> 40:37.530
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome

40:37.680 --> 40:38.681
You're welcome

40:39.080 --> 40:41.526
Well come to think of it I gotta go

40:41.680 --> 40:44.570
Hey it's your day to say
You're welcome

40:44.720 --> 40:45.881
You're welcome

40:46.040 --> 40:48.520
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat

40:48.960 --> 40:51.800
I'm sailing away away
You're welcome

40:51.880 --> 40:52.847
You're welcome

40:53.240 --> 40:55.280
'Cause Maui can do everything but float

40:55.360 --> 40:57.249
- You're welcome
- You're welcome

40:57.600 --> 40:59.728
- You're welcome
- You're welcome

40:59.880 --> 41:00.881
Huh?

41:01.280 --> 41:02.202
And thank you!

41:03.120 --> 41:04.042
Hey!

41:04.440 --> 41:07.728
Let me out!
You lying, slimy son of a...

41:09.560 --> 41:11.403
You're welcome

41:13.240 --> 41:14.446
You're so welcome.

41:20.120 --> 41:22.360
No. I'm not going to Te Fiti
with some kid.

41:22.440 --> 41:23.441
I'm going to get my hook.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.689
You have yours and
I'm not Maui without mine.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.888
Okay, talk to the back.

41:34.920 --> 41:36.081
Boat snack.

42:02.120 --> 42:05.727
Good riddance, you filthy pile of pebbles.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.561
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't look at me like that.

42:08.720 --> 42:11.291
It's a beautiful cave.
She's gonna love it.

42:11.880 --> 42:15.089
And I'm going to love you in ma belly.

42:15.560 --> 42:17.608
Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick.

42:40.840 --> 42:43.127
I could watch that all day.

42:43.280 --> 42:44.964
Okay. Enjoy the island.

42:45.360 --> 42:46.486
Maui, out.

42:46.640 --> 42:47.971
No! Stop!

42:48.320 --> 42:51.164
Hey! You have to put back the heart!

43:06.840 --> 43:08.410
Did not see that coming.

43:10.520 --> 43:13.603
I am Moana of Motunui.

43:13.760 --> 43:14.921
This is my canoe...

43:15.360 --> 43:16.850
and you will journey to...

43:20.080 --> 43:21.684
All right, get over it.
We gotta move.

43:23.920 --> 43:24.807
And she's back.

43:25.280 --> 43:28.329
I am Moana of Motunui...

43:32.680 --> 43:34.440
It was Moana, right?

43:34.520 --> 43:35.203
Yes.

43:35.600 --> 43:37.807
And you will restore the heart!

43:49.200 --> 43:50.087
All right. I'm out.

43:55.680 --> 43:56.886
Oh, come on!

43:57.840 --> 43:59.444
What is your problem?

44:01.400 --> 44:02.890
Are you afraid of it?

44:03.360 --> 44:04.725
No! No.

44:05.320 --> 44:06.242
I'm not afraid.

44:10.160 --> 44:12.242
Stay out of it
or you're sleeping in my armpit.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.401
You, stop it.

44:13.560 --> 44:16.245
That is not a heart. It is a curse.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.528
The second I took it,
I got blasted outta the sky...

44:18.680 --> 44:19.886
and I lost my hook.

44:20.040 --> 44:21.201
Get it away from me.

44:21.640 --> 44:23.051
Get this away?

44:23.400 --> 44:25.164
Hey, hey, hey! I'm a demigod, okay?

44:25.320 --> 44:27.004
Stop that. I will smite you!

44:27.160 --> 44:28.844
You wanna get smote?

44:29.000 --> 44:30.001
Smotten?

44:31.240 --> 44:33.686
Listen, that thing doesn't give you
power to create life...

44:33.840 --> 44:35.569
it's a homing beacon of death.

44:35.720 --> 44:38.007
If you don't put it away,
bad things are gonna come for it.

44:38.440 --> 44:40.169
Come for this? The heart?

44:40.560 --> 44:41.440
You mean this heart right here?

44:41.520 --> 44:43.000
Don't, you can't
raise your voice like that!

44:43.080 --> 44:43.888
Come and get it!

44:44.280 --> 44:45.520
You are gonna get us killed!

44:45.920 --> 44:49.129
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti,
so you can put it back.

44:49.280 --> 44:50.281
Thank you.

44:50.440 --> 44:51.601
You're welcome.

44:56.520 --> 44:57.601
Kakamora.

44:57.760 --> 44:59.046
Kaka-what?

44:59.200 --> 45:00.611
Murdering little pirates.

45:01.560 --> 45:04.211
Wonder what they're here for.

45:08.800 --> 45:10.962
They're kinda cute.

45:28.680 --> 45:29.522
Ocean!

45:29.840 --> 45:31.524
Do something! Help us!

45:31.960 --> 45:34.247
The ocean doesn't help you,
you help yourself!

45:34.400 --> 45:35.811
Tighten the halyard. Bind the stays!

45:37.800 --> 45:38.847
You can't sail?

45:40.680 --> 45:42.250
I am self-taught.

45:53.720 --> 45:55.848
Can't you shapeshift or something?

45:56.000 --> 45:56.887
Do you see my hook?

45:57.200 --> 45:58.884
No magic hook, no magic powers!

46:24.520 --> 46:26.727
Their boat is turning into more boats!

46:46.240 --> 46:48.686
Yep, I just did that.

46:54.360 --> 46:55.521
No, no!

46:56.920 --> 46:57.682
Heihei!

47:11.840 --> 47:12.921
Maui!

47:13.240 --> 47:14.162
They took the heart!

47:16.680 --> 47:17.488
That's a chicken.

47:17.840 --> 47:19.046
The heart is in the...

47:20.000 --> 47:21.764
We have to get him back!

47:26.600 --> 47:27.840
Maui!

47:28.520 --> 47:30.124
Cheeeehoooo!

47:42.200 --> 47:43.884
There! Right there!

47:44.040 --> 47:44.768
You're turning?

47:45.200 --> 47:46.042
What are you doing?

47:46.480 --> 47:47.606
Escaping!

47:48.080 --> 47:48.967
The heart!

47:49.320 --> 47:50.924
Forget it! You'll never get it back!

47:51.080 --> 47:52.880
Besides, you got a better one.

47:52.960 --> 47:53.802
Hey!

47:54.240 --> 47:55.969
What am I gonna steer with?

47:56.560 --> 47:58.085
They're just gonna kill ya!

48:02.480 --> 48:03.561
Coconuts.

48:46.440 --> 48:47.646
Got it!

48:51.560 --> 48:52.402
Hey!

49:08.400 --> 49:09.401
Yeah!

49:10.520 --> 49:11.362
We did it!

49:13.040 --> 49:14.929
Congratulations on not being dead, girlie.

49:15.320 --> 49:16.481
You surprise me.

49:16.960 --> 49:19.042
But I'm still not taking that thing back.

49:20.680 --> 49:23.365
You wanna get to Te Fiti you gotta
go through a whole ocean of bad.

49:23.880 --> 49:24.802
Not to mention Te Kā.

49:26.520 --> 49:27.851
Lava monster?

49:28.360 --> 49:29.930
Ever defeat a lava monster?

49:30.720 --> 49:32.882
No. Have you?

49:40.520 --> 49:43.649
I'm not going on a suicide mission
with some mortal.

49:44.240 --> 49:47.050
You can't restore the heart without me...

49:47.200 --> 49:48.964
and me says no.

49:49.920 --> 49:51.251
I'm getting my hook.

49:52.400 --> 49:53.401
End of discussion.

50:00.400 --> 50:02.402
You'd be a hero.

50:04.720 --> 50:06.802
That's what you're all about, right?

50:06.960 --> 50:09.804
Little girl, I am a hero.

50:09.960 --> 50:11.450
Maybe you were.

50:11.600 --> 50:12.726
But now...

50:12.880 --> 50:15.804
now you're just the guy
who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

50:15.960 --> 50:18.281
The guy who cursed the world.

50:19.680 --> 50:20.727
You're no one's hero.

50:21.600 --> 50:22.328
No one?

50:32.280 --> 50:33.008
But...

50:33.640 --> 50:35.051
put this back...

50:35.440 --> 50:37.044
save the world...

50:37.400 --> 50:39.209
you'd be everyone's hero.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.129
Maui! Maui! Maui!

50:47.800 --> 50:49.450
You're so amazing!

50:50.040 --> 50:52.771
We'd never make it without my hook.
Not past Te Kā.

50:52.920 --> 50:54.046
Then we get your hook.

50:54.440 --> 50:57.887
We get your hook, take out Te Kā,
restore the heart.

50:58.040 --> 51:00.691
Unless you don't wanna be...

51:00.840 --> 51:03.969
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea.

51:04.160 --> 51:05.571
Hero to...

51:06.080 --> 51:07.241
all.

51:10.920 --> 51:12.410
First, we get my hook.

51:12.880 --> 51:14.211
Then save the world.

51:14.560 --> 51:15.400
Deal?

51:15.480 --> 51:16.322
Deal.

51:21.080 --> 51:21.888
Worth a shot.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.447
Okay, we go east.

51:25.880 --> 51:27.006
To the lair of Tamatoa.

51:29.160 --> 51:32.687
If anyone has my hook,
it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.

51:45.200 --> 51:46.565
Teach me to sail.

51:49.040 --> 51:52.249
My job is to deliver Maui
across the great ocean.

51:52.400 --> 51:53.401
I should...

51:54.760 --> 51:56.683
I should be sailing.

51:57.080 --> 51:58.889
It's called wayfinding, princess.

51:59.520 --> 52:01.409
And it's not just sails and knots...

52:01.800 --> 52:04.167
it's seeing where you're going
in your mind.

52:04.600 --> 52:06.409
Knowing where you are...

52:06.800 --> 52:08.006
by knowing where you've been.

52:08.360 --> 52:10.681
Okay, first, I'm not a princess.

52:11.240 --> 52:12.287
I am the daughter of the chief.

52:12.480 --> 52:13.641
- Same difference.
- No.

52:13.800 --> 52:16.451
If you wear a dress,
and you have an animal sidekick...

52:16.600 --> 52:17.647
you're a princess.

52:18.080 --> 52:19.081
You are not a wayfinder.

52:19.440 --> 52:22.683
You will never be a wayfinder,
you will never be a...

52:28.040 --> 52:30.247
Really? Blow dart in my butt cheek?

52:35.680 --> 52:38.365
You are a bad person.

52:38.720 --> 52:40.245
If you can talk, you can teach.

52:40.400 --> 52:41.401
Wayfinding.

52:42.680 --> 52:44.364
Lesson one. Hit it.

52:47.040 --> 52:48.121
Pull the sheet.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.640
Not the sheet.

52:50.720 --> 52:51.600
No.

52:51.680 --> 52:52.408
Nope.

52:53.040 --> 52:54.929
Nope. No.

52:56.040 --> 52:57.644
Tried that one already.

53:01.120 --> 53:04.920
You're measuring the stars,
not giving the sky a high-five.

53:06.320 --> 53:09.210
If the current's warm,
you're going the right way.

53:11.120 --> 53:12.610
It's cold.

53:12.760 --> 53:14.762
Wait, it's getting warmer.

53:16.400 --> 53:19.529
That is disgusting!
What is wrong with you?

53:36.240 --> 53:37.480
We're here?

53:38.280 --> 53:40.647
See, told you I could do it!

53:49.160 --> 53:50.400
Motunui?

53:51.600 --> 53:53.204
I'm home?

53:56.800 --> 53:58.484
- Moana!
- Dad?

53:59.320 --> 54:00.924
Moana!

54:01.320 --> 54:02.242
Mom?

54:03.680 --> 54:04.886
Help!

54:06.800 --> 54:07.483
No!

54:08.280 --> 54:09.406
Moana!

54:12.240 --> 54:13.969
Enjoy your beauty rest?

54:14.320 --> 54:16.846
You know, a real wayfinder never sleeps...

54:17.000 --> 54:19.651
so they actually get
where they need to go.

54:20.280 --> 54:21.566
Muscle up, buttercup.

54:22.320 --> 54:23.810
We're here.

54:25.320 --> 54:27.448
You're sure this guy's gonna
have your hook?

54:27.920 --> 54:29.843
Tamatoa? Oh, he'll have it.

54:30.320 --> 54:34.086
He's a scavenger. Collects stuff.
Thinks it makes him look cool.

54:36.040 --> 54:37.769
And for Tamatoa, trust me...

54:37.960 --> 54:40.486
my hook is the coolest collectible.

54:40.960 --> 54:43.361
And he lives up there?

54:45.560 --> 54:46.288
No, no, no.

54:46.760 --> 54:48.171
That's just the entrance...

54:48.320 --> 54:50.527
to Lalotai.

54:50.880 --> 54:51.722
Lalotai?

54:52.120 --> 54:53.884
Realm of monsters?

54:54.520 --> 54:56.363
We're going to the realm of monsters?

54:56.840 --> 54:59.047
We? No. Me.

54:59.520 --> 55:02.000
You are gonna stay here
with the other chicken.

55:04.360 --> 55:06.010
That's what I'm talking about.
Gimme some.

55:07.280 --> 55:09.681
Come on. That was a good one.
How do you not get it?

55:09.840 --> 55:12.002
I called her a chicken,
there's a chicken on the boat.

55:12.400 --> 55:13.890
I know she's human, but that's not the...

55:14.080 --> 55:15.605
You know what? Forget it. Forget it!

55:15.760 --> 55:17.250
I'm not explaining it to you.

55:17.400 --> 55:19.004
'Cause then it's not funny.

55:32.800 --> 55:34.882
So, daughter of the chief...

55:35.040 --> 55:36.530
I thought you stayed in the village.

55:36.680 --> 55:38.250
You know, kissing babies and things.

55:39.360 --> 55:41.400
Hey, I'm just trying to understand...

55:41.480 --> 55:43.881
why your people decided to send...

55:44.040 --> 55:45.963
How do I phrase this? You.

55:46.360 --> 55:49.569
My people didn't send me.

55:49.720 --> 55:50.881
The ocean did.

55:51.040 --> 55:52.280
The ocean?

55:52.440 --> 55:53.440
Makes sense.

55:53.520 --> 55:55.280
You're what, eight? Can't sail.

55:55.360 --> 55:56.282
Obvious choice.

55:56.720 --> 56:00.122
It chose me for a reason.

56:00.280 --> 56:01.850
If the ocean's so smart...

56:02.040 --> 56:05.123
why didn't it just take the heart
back to Te Fiti itself?

56:05.280 --> 56:06.884
Or bring me my hook?

56:07.280 --> 56:09.408
The ocean's straight up kooky-dooks.

56:10.560 --> 56:12.369
But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.407
You're the Chosen One!

56:31.120 --> 56:34.408
The ocean chose you for a reason.

56:34.560 --> 56:37.086
If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up.

56:37.880 --> 56:40.008
So, not seeing an entrance.

56:40.360 --> 56:42.328
Yes, because it only appears...

56:42.480 --> 56:44.323
after a human sacrifice.

56:46.360 --> 56:47.691
Kidding.

56:47.880 --> 56:49.120
So serious.

57:12.800 --> 57:13.687
Don't worry...

57:14.080 --> 57:16.128
it's a lot farther down than it looks.

57:16.520 --> 57:18.204
Cheeeehoooo!

57:22.680 --> 57:25.570
I am still falling!

57:27.680 --> 57:28.966
You can do this.

57:29.800 --> 57:30.687
Go!

57:51.880 --> 57:54.451
And he sticks the landing.

57:56.800 --> 57:59.121
What? Dum-dum, she's not even here.

57:59.280 --> 58:01.567
No mortal's gonna jump
into the realm of...

58:01.880 --> 58:02.688
Huh?

58:07.080 --> 58:09.003
Well, she's dead.

58:09.840 --> 58:11.683
Okay, let's get my hook.

59:12.720 --> 59:14.802
Maui's fishhook!

59:14.960 --> 59:15.961
Yeah!

59:17.240 --> 59:18.241
Sorry!

59:18.400 --> 59:19.287
I thought you were a monster...

59:19.640 --> 59:20.801
But I found your hook.

59:20.960 --> 59:23.122
And, you're right, this Tamatoa guy
really likes his treasure.

59:23.280 --> 59:24.281
Stay.

59:24.440 --> 59:26.647
What? No.
I'm the one who found...

59:27.040 --> 59:28.326
Listen. For a thousand years...

59:28.480 --> 59:30.687
I've only been thinking of
keeping this hair silky...

59:30.840 --> 59:31.921
getting my hook...

59:32.080 --> 59:33.650
and being awesome again.

59:33.840 --> 59:36.047
And it's not getting screwed up
by a mortal...

59:36.480 --> 59:40.087
who has no business
inside of a monster cave, except...

59:41.960 --> 59:43.325
Except...

59:43.480 --> 59:44.527
maybe as bait.

59:44.920 --> 59:45.887
Huh?

59:46.680 --> 59:47.841
Wow!

59:48.000 --> 59:50.048
The shiny, glittery cave.

59:50.200 --> 59:51.531
And just like me...

59:51.880 --> 59:54.247
it is covered in sparkly treasure.

59:54.680 --> 59:56.409
Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.

59:56.560 --> 59:57.846
You're not selling it!

59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.003
This is stupid!
I'm just gonna walk up and get it!

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.444
You go up there, he will kill you.
Just stick to the plan.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.242
When he shows up, keep him distracted.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.890
Make him talk about himself.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.048
He loves bragging about how great he is.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.850
You two must get along swell.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.851
No, not since I ripped off his leg.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.170
You ripped off his...

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.362
Maui?

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.361
What have we here?

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:34.048
It's a sparkly, shiny... Wait a minute.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:37.567
It's a human!

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:41.327
What are you doing down here,
in the realm of the...

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.960
Just pick an eye, babe.

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.360
I can't concentrate
on what I'm saying if you keep...

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.965
Yeah, pick one, pick one!

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.800
You're a funny-looking little thing,
aren't you?

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.291
Don't! That's my gramma's!

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.562
"That's my gramma's!"

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.801
I ate my gramma!

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.447
And it took a week,
'cause she was absolutely humongous.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:58.045
Why are you here?

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.805
'Cause you're amazing!

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:06.371
And we mortals have heard of the tale
of the crab who became a legend!

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.888
And I just had to know...

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.602
how you became so...

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.481
crabulous?

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:20.002
Are you just trying to get me
to talk about myself?

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.125
Because if you are...

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.322
I will gladly do so.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.243
Huh?

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.761
In song form!

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:32.762
Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:36.083
I was a drab little crab once

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.087
Now I know I can be happy as a clam

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.602
Because I'm beautiful, baby

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:43.962
And did your granny say

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.850
Listen to your heart

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.971
Be who you are on the inside

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:52.363
I need three words
To tear her argument apart

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:53.807
Your granny lied

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.849
I'd rather be shiny

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.890
Like a treasure
From a sunken pirate wreck

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.328
Scrub the deck
And make it look shiny

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.525
I will sparkle like a
Wealthy woman's neck

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.043
Just a sec
Don't ya know

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:12.081
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.846
Beginners

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.481
Oh, and here they come, come, come

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.920
To the brightest thing that glitters

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:19.960
Mm, fish dinners

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.202
I just love free food

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.890
And you look like seafood

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.049
Hey, crab cake!

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.365
I'm back.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.762
It's Maui Time!

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.801
What do you say, little buddy?

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.569
Giant hawk? Coming up!

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.085
Cheeeehoooo!

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.129
Cheeeehoooo!

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.403
Well, well, well.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.640
Little Maui's having trouble with his look

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.882
Ya little semi-demi-mini-god

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.601
Ouch
What a terrible performance

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.211
Get the hook
Get it?

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.091
You don't swing it
Like you used to, man

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.730
Yet I have to give you
Credit for my start

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.884
And your tattoos on the outside

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:21.284
For just like you
I made myself a work of art

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.483
I'll never hide, I can't

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.767
I'm too shiny

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.890
Watch me dazzle
Like a diamond in the rough

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.408
Strut my stuff
My stuffis so shiny

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.001
Send your armies
But they'll never be enough

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.643
My shell's too tough
Maui, man

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.160
You can try, try, try
But you can't expect a demigod

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:43.447
To beat a decapod
Look it up

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.405
You will die, die, die

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.450
Now it's time for me to take apart

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.884
Your achin' heart

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:55.320
Far from the ones who abandoned you

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:59.520
Chasing the love of these humans

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.683
Who made you feel wanted

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.446
You tried to be tough

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:09.730
But your armor's just not hard enough

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:14.360
Maui, now it's time to kick your heinie

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.444
Ever seen someone so shiny

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.644
Soak it in
'Cause it's the last you'll ever see

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.326
C'est la vie
Mon ami

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.051
I'm so shiny

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:27.125
Now I eat you so prepare your final plea

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.327
Just for me

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:32.081
You'll never be quite as shiny

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:36.287
You wish you were nice and shiny

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.321
- Hey!
- Huh?

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.803
I got something shiny for ya!

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.327
The heart of Te Fiti.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.721
You can't run from me!

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.566
Oh, you can.
You keep surprising me.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.404
There's only so far you can get
on those two little legs.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.484
The power of creation...

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.205
for a crustacean.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.890
Where is it? Where is it?

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.164
We gotta go!

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:10.841
What about the heart?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.480
He can have it.
I've got a better one.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.171
Yes, I have the...

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:17.321
Wait a minute.

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:20.331
I see, she's taken a barnacle
and she's covered it in...

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:23.683
bioluminescent algae as a diversion.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.002
Come back here!

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.841
Cheeeehoooo!

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.881
Hey!

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.690
Did you like the song?

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.726
We're alive!

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:50.681
Listen...

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.963
- I appreciate what you did down there.
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:55.082
- Took guts.
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.521
- But...
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:57.767
I'm sorry.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.969
I'm trying to be sincere for once,
and it feels like you're distracted.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.044
No, no. No way!

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.481
Really? Because you're looking at me
like I have a...

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.487
shark head.

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:12.804
What? Do you have a shark head?

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.730
Look, the point is...

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.804
for a little girl, child, thing,
whatever...

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:20.486
who had no business being down there...

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.405
you did me a solid.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.688
But you also almost died.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.000
And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab.

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:29.242
So, chances of beating Te Kā?

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.561
Bupkis.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.963
We're never making it to Te Fiti.
This mission is cursed.

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:35.407
It's not cursed.

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:36.962
Shark head.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.006
It is not cursed.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.082
Cursed.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.442
What can I say except

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.443
We're dead soon

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.165
We're dead soon

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.083
Can you at least try?

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.489
Giant hawk.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.360
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
We're dead soon

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.044
All right, break time's over.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.362
Get up.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.887
Why? Are you gonna
give me a speech?

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:27.806
Tell me I can beat Te Kā
'cause I'm "Maui?"

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:30.641
Take a hike, Tiny.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.120
How do you get your tattoos?

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.807
They show up. When I earn them.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:45.564
How'd you earn that one?
What's that for?

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:49.008
That's man's discovery of Nunya.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.247
What's Nunya?

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.801
Nunya business.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.641
I'll just keep asking.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:57.882
What's it for?

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.842
You need to stop doing that.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.011
- Back off.
- Just tell me what it is.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.851
I said back off.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.684
Is it why your hook's not working?

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:29.490
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.921
You wanna throw me off the boat...

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:33.964
throw me off.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:37.442
You wanna tell me
I don't know what I'm doing...

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.564
I know I don't.

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.729
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.609
You're right.

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:50.205
But my island is dying...

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.122
so I am here.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:57.087
It's just me and you.

01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:59.925
And I want to help...

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.368
but I can't if you don't let me.

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:12.286
I wasn't born a demigod.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.127
I had human parents.

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:21.451
They took one look and decided...

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.001
they did not want me.

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.648
They threw me into the sea...

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:30.129
like I was nothing.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:35.082
Somehow, I was found by the gods.

01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:36.925
They gave me the hook.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.805
They made me...

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.600
Maui.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:44.725
And back to the humans I went.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:48.970
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.201
Anything they could ever want.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.287
You took the heart for them.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.890
You did everything for them.

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.489
So they'd love you.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:05.249
It was never enough.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:16.728
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.043
Maybe the ocean brought you to them...

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:24.330
because it saw someone
who was worthy of being saved.

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:29.167
But the gods aren't the ones
who make you Maui.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.080
You are.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.363
Okay, okay.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.846
I love you, too, buddy.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:36.920
Cheeeehoooo!

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.643
Yeah!

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.651
Next stop, Te Fiti.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.242
What?

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.130
I figured it out.

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:14.201
You know, the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands...

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:18.160
'cause your ancestors
would sail her seas and find 'em.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:21.764
All those new lands, new villages.

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:24.561
It was the water that connected 'em all.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.650
And if I were the ocean...

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:30.885
I think I'd be looking for
a curly-haired non-princess...

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.483
to start that again.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:38.043
That is literally the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:41.208
Probably should have saved it for Te Fiti.

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:43.921
I did.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:48.888
Moana of Motunui...

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:54.770
I believe you have officially
delivered Maui across the great sea.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.360
Moana! Moana! Moana!

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.569
You're so amazing!

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.367
It's time.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.210
Go save the world.

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:26.523
Cheeeehoooo!

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.161
Maui!

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.846
What are you doing?

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:25.804
Finding you a better way in!

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.209
- We won't make it!
- Yes, we will!

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.482
- Turn around!
- No!

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.766
Moana, stop!

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:32.768
No!

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.644
Are you okay?

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.201
Maui?

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.929
I told you to turn back.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.924
I thought we could make it.

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:20.242
We?

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.962
I thought I could make it.

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:27.046
We can fix it.

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.328
It was made by the gods.

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.204
You can't fix it!

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:33.728
Next time we'll be more careful.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.088
Te Kā was stuck on the barrier islands.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.686
It's lava, it can't go in the water.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.842
We can find a way around.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.843
I'm not going back.

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.530
We still have to restore the heart.

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.245
My hook is cracked.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.050
One more hit, and it's over.

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:51.283
Maui, you have to restore the heart.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.364
Without my hook, I am nothing.

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:54.681
That's not true!

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:57.326
Without my hook, I am nothing!

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.160
We are only here...

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:11.490
because you stole the heart
in the first place.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:15.411
No, we're here because
the ocean told you you're special...

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.403
and you believed it.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.080
I am Moana of Motunui.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:23.487
- You will board my boat...
- Goodbye, Moana.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:24.727
...sail across the sea...

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.048
I'm not killing myself...

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.480
so you can prove
you're something you're not!

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:28.926
...and restore the heart of Te Fiti!

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:32.001
The ocean chose me!

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.644
It chose wrong.

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.441
Maui!

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.920
Why did you bring me here?

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.808
I'm not the right person.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:15.444
You have to choose someone else.

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:20.331
Choose someone else.

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.451
Please.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:42.800
No.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.001
You're a long ways past the reef.

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:03.361
Gramma?

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:08.370
Guess I chose the right tattoo.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.405
Gramma!

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:17.568
I tried, Gramma.

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.164
I couldn't do it.

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:24.446
It's not your fault.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.366
I never should have put so much
on your shoulders.

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.248
If you are ready to go home...

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:34.682
I will be with you.

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.924
Why do you hesitate?

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:55.964
I don't know.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.927
I know a girl from an island

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:05.605
She stands apart from the crowd

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:09.044
She loves the sea and her people

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.722
She makes her whole family proud

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.565
Sometimes the world seems against you

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:19.130
The journey may leave a scar

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:22.090
But scars can heal and reveal just

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.846
Where you are

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:28.764
The people you love will change you

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:32.010
The things you have learned will guide you

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.608
And nothing on earth can silence

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:38.889
The quiet voice still inside you

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:42.443
And when that voice starts to whisper

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:45.251
Moana, you've come so far

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.764
Moana, listen

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:52.608
Do you know who you are?

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.285
Who am I?

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:01.767
I am a girl who loves my island

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:05.687
And the girl who loves the sea

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:09.169
It calls me

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:14.170
I am the daughter of the village chief

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:17.644
We are descended from voyagers

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.361
Who found their way across the world

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:22.729
They call me

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.131
I've delivered us to where we are

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:30.291
I have journeyed farther

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.201
I am everything I've learned and more

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.484
Still it calls me

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.801
And the call isn't out there at all

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:42.770
It's inside me

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:45.163
It's like the tide

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:49.644
Always falling and rising

01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.487
I will carry you here in my heart

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:55.723
You remind me

01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:58.850
That come what may

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.004
I know the way

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:06.768
I am Moana

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:43.521
I am Moana of Motunui.

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.480
Aboard my boat...

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.403
I will sail across the sea...

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:51.730
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.002
Te Kā can't follow us into the water.

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.250
We make it past the barrier islands...

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:34.320
we make it to Te Fiti.

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:36.080
None of which you understand...

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:38.365
because you are a chicken.

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:45.881
No!

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:49.640
Heihei! No, no, no!

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.321
Nice work!

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:02.767
Te Fiti.

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:29.805
Maui!

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:34.847
You came back.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.046
But your hook.

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.725
One more hit and...

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.045
Te Kā's gotta catch me first.

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.242
I got your back, Chosen One.

01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.880
Go save the world.

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:51.768
Maui.

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.681
Thank you.

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:55.966
You're welcome.

01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:58.284
Cheeeehoooo!

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.166
Hot-hot-hot, hot-hot-hot!

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:31.130
Hey, Te Kā!

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:32.842
Shark head!

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:35.487
Cheeeehoooo!

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.121
Moana!

01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:59.203
Get the heart to the spiral!

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.122
Te Fiti...

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.725
it's gone.

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.044
Te Kā!

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:32.166
Let her come to me.

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:59.127
I have crossed the horizon to find you

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.681
I know your name

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:16.411
They have stolen the heart from inside you

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:24.283
But this does not define you

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:31.811
This is not who you are

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:38.731
You know who you are

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:48.211
Who you truly are.

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.487
Te Fiti!

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.365
The chicken lives.

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:58.202
I'm sorry about your hook.

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:01.724
Well, hook, no hook...

01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:03.804
I'm Maui.

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:24.484
Te Fiti!

01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:27.563
Hey, I mean, how you been?

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:33.246
Look, what I did was...

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:34.845
wrong.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.048
I have no excuse.

01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:38.766
I'm sorry.

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:51.242
You know, it'd be rude to refuse
a gift from a goddess.

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.243
Cheeeehoooo!

01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:57.127
Thank you.

01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:59.840
Your kind gesture is deeply appreciated.

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:00.921
Cheeeehoooo.

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:51.085
Gonna miss you, drumstick.

01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:52.287
You could come with us, you know.

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:56.807
My people are going to need
a master wayfinder.

01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:00.243
They already have one.

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:19.766
See you out there, Maui.

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:23.047
See you out there, Moana.

01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:24.846
Cheeeehoooo!

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:17.890
Mom! Dad!

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.201
Moana!

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:31.762
I may have gone
a little ways past the reef.

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:34.730
It suits you.

01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:35.688
She's back!

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:37.081
Moana!

01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:38.241
Pua!

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:41.402
Moana!

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:44.845
Welcome home!

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:36.967
We set a course to find

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:41.364
A brand new island everywhere we roam

01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:46.041
We keep our island in our mind

01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:50.884
And when it's time to find home
We know the way

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:55.450
We are explorers reading every sign

01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:01.524
We tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chain

01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:12.522
We know the way

01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:08.931
Shiny

01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:11.966
I'm so shiny

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:14.369
Didn't help me though, did it?

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:16.488
Still upside down here.

01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:18.921
Just need a little push.

01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:22.081
Can we be real?

01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:25.642
If my name was Sebastian
and I had a cool Jamaican accent...

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:27.006
you'd totally help me.

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:28.810
You would. You know you would.
