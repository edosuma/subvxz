Hundreds of years.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.801
Hundreds of years.

37:22.907 --> 37:28.780
My Christoph.
What of my son?

37:28.813 --> 37:34.753
He was saved when you were
taken over by the Dark One.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.154
[sobs]

37:36.187 --> 37:38.723
What became of him?

37:38.757 --> 37:41.159
Was‐ was he loved?
Did he‐

37:41.192 --> 37:42.861
He lived.

37:42.894 --> 37:45.163
I'll show you. Come.

37:53.204 --> 37:54.572
Here.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.074
In the book.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.680
This is him.

38:04.482 --> 38:08.453
He lived a full and happy life.

38:08.486 --> 38:15.160
Had children of his own,
started a family legacy.

38:15.193 --> 38:17.061
He was the first of us.

38:17.095 --> 38:21.099
My namesake,
Jack Van Helsing.

38:23.067 --> 38:28.006
You mean to say that
my son is your ancestor?

38:28.039 --> 38:29.374
Yeah.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.743
Which means you are, too.

38:34.312 --> 38:38.283
It's the piece the Dark One
never figured out.

38:38.316 --> 38:43.354
All she did back then,
all the suffering she caused,

38:43.388 --> 38:46.057
it all sowed the seeds
for her own downfall.

38:46.090 --> 38:51.729
She created the Van Helsings
and she didn't even know it.

38:52.897 --> 38:54.866
Thank you both.

38:56.367 --> 39:00.905
Thank you for saving me.

39:03.107 --> 39:06.511
Well, I guess I always knew
it'd end up like this.

39:06.544 --> 39:09.948
Sometimes you think
a road is straight, you know?

39:13.251 --> 39:18.356
Turns out it's just winding its
way around in a big old circle.

39:18.389 --> 39:20.458
Right back to the beginning.

39:23.728 --> 39:27.265
Never really knew where this
journey was gonna take me,

39:27.298 --> 39:30.268
but I was always sure
of one thing.

39:32.604 --> 39:38.009
Wherever you went,
I was going, too.

39:40.411 --> 39:42.847
I didn't give up on you then

39:45.450 --> 39:48.152
and I ain't giving up on you
now, Sleeping Beauty.

40:15.446 --> 40:19.150
[clock ticking]

40:30.161 --> 40:31.396
[door opens]

40:32.563 --> 40:34.499
Who's there?

40:50.181 --> 40:51.482
It's ok.

40:51.516 --> 40:53.885
Didn't mean to scare you.

40:54.352 --> 40:56.187
Susan.

40:56.220 --> 40:57.989
Hey.

40:58.022 --> 41:00.024
What're you doing here?

41:00.058 --> 41:03.795
Waiting for you.

41:03.828 --> 41:06.364
Where are we?

41:06.397 --> 41:07.999
Don't you recognize it?

41:08.032 --> 41:11.402
I know we're in
my apartment but...

41:12.103 --> 41:14.539
She's waiting for you, too.

41:20.345 --> 41:22.113
Dylan.

41:26.050 --> 41:28.052
Hi, mom.

41:35.293 --> 41:37.562
[gasps]

41:37.595 --> 41:40.531
Look at you.

41:40.565 --> 41:44.002
You're so grown up.

41:44.035 --> 41:46.371
This is who I am.

41:46.404 --> 41:49.440
This is what I would
have been.

41:51.075 --> 41:53.378
Is this an illusion?

41:55.179 --> 41:58.116
Am I back in the Dark Realm?

41:58.149 --> 42:00.184
What's the Dark Realm?

42:00.218 --> 42:02.520
None of this is real.

42:02.553 --> 42:04.555
You, Susan.

42:04.589 --> 42:07.558
It's as real as
you want it to be.

42:10.428 --> 42:12.397
I missed you, mom.

42:16.267 --> 42:18.569
[cries]

42:18.603 --> 42:19.570
I missed you.

42:19.604 --> 42:22.273
I missed you so much, baby.

42:25.343 --> 42:28.079
I missed you so much.

42:32.083 --> 42:36.387
Even in darkness there
are stars to guide you.

42:36.421 --> 42:38.756
Never lose hope.

42:38.790 --> 42:41.592
Keep faith in yourself.

42:41.626 --> 42:45.430
May you always find your way,

42:45.463 --> 42:48.332
because you are the light.
