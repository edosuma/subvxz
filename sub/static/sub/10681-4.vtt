nutrients through touch.

08:49.649 --> 08:52.482
a real, legit
double-telescoping Darth Vader,

08:52.485 --> 08:55.019
before I even start, I
want to bring in my expert.

08:55.020 --> 08:56.520
All right, sure, yeah. Make that call.

08:56.523 --> 08:57.522
All right, man. Chill out for one second.

08:57.524 --> 08:59.057
Let me give him a call.

08:59.058 --> 09:01.058
You can't be talking
purchasing loose figures

09:01.061 --> 09:02.360
unless you Che in first

09:02.361 --> 09:05.028
with Mr. Popculturizm, Rob Bruce.

09:05.030 --> 09:07.097
You know, as a rule, the Stash is usually

09:07.100 --> 09:08.866
not interested in loose figures,

09:08.869 --> 09:10.268
but when that loose figure

09:10.269 --> 09:12.102
may be the Holy Grail of loose figures?

09:12.105 --> 09:14.706
You've got to throw away the rule book,

09:14.707 --> 09:16.106
and just play it by ear.

09:16.109 --> 09:17.741
Is it an entire book

09:17.744 --> 09:19.409
that just says, "We
don't buy loose figures"?

09:19.412 --> 09:21.111
- [all laugh]
- That's like a Post-it.

09:21.114 --> 09:24.014
- Yeah.
- [all laugh]

09:24.017 --> 09:25.783
- How you doing? Pleasure.
- Good to meet you.

09:25.784 --> 09:28.086
I'm Robert. Uh, you said that, uh,

09:28.087 --> 09:30.355
- you got this for Christmas...
- Yep.

09:30.356 --> 09:32.256
- When you were a kid.
- Right off the shelf.

09:32.259 --> 09:33.758
It's great to see a piece like this

09:33.759 --> 09:35.927
survive that capsule of time.

09:35.928 --> 09:37.528
Looks like you're lifting
up the skirt there.

09:37.529 --> 09:39.429
- What are you looking for?
- Just to make sure

09:39.432 --> 09:42.033
it's the right manufacturing
mark, Hong Kong.

09:42.034 --> 09:43.301
Are there people trying to fake these?

09:43.302 --> 09:44.735
Absolutely.

09:44.738 --> 09:46.471
"Star Wars" is incredibly hot right now.

09:46.472 --> 09:48.273
It's the Cadillac of toys.

09:48.274 --> 09:49.874
Carded figures are bringing prices

09:49.875 --> 09:51.109
that nobody's ever seen.

09:51.110 --> 09:52.543
It's a great figure. I mean...

09:52.544 --> 09:54.245
- So if I was...
- What do you need to know?

09:54.246 --> 09:56.713
Is it legit? It looks 100% legit.

09:56.716 --> 09:59.049
This is the rarest production of this.

09:59.052 --> 10:01.152
Basically you have a home run.

10:01.153 --> 10:03.888
There's no way around it.

10:03.889 --> 10:06.823
But you know, its value is very subjective.

10:06.826 --> 10:08.625
What I see, from time and time again,

10:08.628 --> 10:10.294
the Holy Grail is... All of a sudden,

10:10.297 --> 10:12.964
somebody opens up a door
and there's 400 of 'em.

10:12.966 --> 10:15.432
The market goes soft. Now
will that happen with this?

10:15.434 --> 10:17.100
Probably not. But the fact that

10:17.102 --> 10:19.570
there's, like, 22 known, 25 known,

10:19.572 --> 10:21.405
I think that number goes up every day.

10:21.408 --> 10:24.475
Wow. Um...

10:24.476 --> 10:25.643
what do you want for it?

10:25.644 --> 10:27.611
I'm looking for $4,000 for it.

10:27.614 --> 10:29.913
$4,000.

10:29.916 --> 10:34.085
I'd feel comfortable offering you today...

10:34.086 --> 10:37.154
$1,100.

10:37.157 --> 10:39.090
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

10:39.091 --> 10:40.658
[laughter]

10:40.659 --> 10:42.994
See, I've heard this
referred to as the Holy Grail,

10:42.995 --> 10:44.595
and King Arthur wouldn't lowball somebody

10:44.596 --> 10:45.929
to get the Holy Grail.

10:45.932 --> 10:47.197
There's a lot of Holy Grails.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.100
King Arthur was only looking for one.

10:49.101 --> 10:51.802
Could think $3,700. Could we go $3,700?

10:51.804 --> 10:53.236
$1,500 for it.

10:55.139 --> 10:57.607
If you're not interested in $1,500,

10:57.610 --> 11:00.010
I-I would have to think
that the Stash is out.

11:00.013 --> 11:02.179
Robert, if you have any interest, I'm out.

11:02.182 --> 11:04.716
I could offer you $1,800.

11:04.717 --> 11:07.118
Um... I don't know, man.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.653
I, uh... I don't think you're
the droids I'm looking for.

11:09.655 --> 11:11.556
- Don't think I can do it.
- All right, man, well,

11:11.557 --> 11:13.024
- sorry it couldn't happen.
- Thank you.

11:13.025 --> 11:14.225
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

11:14.226 --> 11:15.225
- All right.
- Take care, guys.

11:15.227 --> 11:17.729
- See you later.
- Wow.

11:17.730 --> 11:19.129
Quint's jacket, hat.

11:19.131 --> 11:20.664
This is the jacket that he wore.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.167
- Quint's coat?
- This is awesome.

11:22.253 --> 11:23.411
- How does it look?
- Wow.

11:24.765 --> 11:26.868
Favorite Spielberg movie, man.

11:26.870 --> 11:29.202
Hands down for me, it's "Jaws."

11:29.205 --> 11:32.706
Saw it when I was five.
Watched it just the other week.

11:32.709 --> 11:33.941
Still holds up.

11:33.942 --> 11:35.775
Well, I know you'd say, man...

11:35.778 --> 11:38.278
- No contest.
- How much do we love "Jaws"?

11:38.280 --> 11:40.047
- More than I love my family.
- You know what I'm saying?

11:40.048 --> 11:41.948
Sometimes I look at my wife and I'm like,

11:41.951 --> 11:43.884
"You're pretty perfect,
but 'Jaws' is perfect."

11:43.886 --> 11:46.888
- [all laugh]
- Yeah, exactly.

11:46.889 --> 11:49.490
Ming, your favorite
Spielberg movie of all time.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.558
It's gotta be "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind."

11:51.561 --> 11:53.561
Really? That one over "E.T."?

11:53.562 --> 11:56.797
Yeah, I just think the
darker tone, Devil's Tower...

11:56.798 --> 11:58.466
I mean, isn't it like the alien's on screen

11:58.467 --> 11:59.966
for like, what, 30 seconds?

11:59.969 --> 12:02.003
Oh, he doesn't show you an alien

12:02.004 --> 12:03.971
until the last, like, two minutes.

12:03.972 --> 12:06.673
And it worked, like, in 1979.

12:06.676 --> 12:08.676
Then when he gets to "E.T.,"
the first minute, he's like,

12:08.677 --> 12:10.811
"Here's your alien." [laughter]

12:10.812 --> 12:12.679
What about you, man? It's gotta be "Jaws."

12:12.682 --> 12:15.383
Uh... uh... you're... No, it's not "Jaws."

12:15.384 --> 12:17.717
- I-I mean, you guys...
- I'm about to flip this table

12:17.720 --> 12:19.486
unless you say "Jaws."
What... what could it be?

12:19.489 --> 12:21.054
Uh, "Jaws 2."

12:21.057 --> 12:22.722
[all laugh]

12:22.725 --> 12:24.558
I don't want you flippin' no tables.

12:33.102 --> 12:34.836
<i>You sure this is the right place?</i>

12:34.837 --> 12:36.638
<i>This can't possibly be the right address.</i>

12:36.639 --> 12:39.240
<i>It... I-I know it doesn't look like much.</i>

12:39.243 --> 12:40.639
It doesn't look like anything.

12:42.105 --> 12:43.971
We're pulling up to what's supposed to be

12:43.974 --> 12:45.841
the "Jaws" museum, and it just looks like

12:45.842 --> 12:47.341
some abandoned warehouse.

12:47.344 --> 12:48.911
Well, aside from the "Jaws" museum,

12:48.913 --> 12:50.445
it was an abandoned warehouse.

12:50.447 --> 12:52.413
[all laugh]

12:53.783 --> 12:55.951
Was I lying? See?

12:55.952 --> 12:57.852
- No.
- Looks can be deceiving.

12:57.855 --> 12:59.821
- This is pretty cool.
- Amity Island.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.255
- This way.
- This way.

13:01.258 --> 13:02.291
- This is awesome.
- Hey.

13:02.293 --> 13:03.825
- Hey, how are ya?
- Good.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.427
I'm Chris Kiska. I'm
the owner of the largest

13:05.428 --> 13:07.261
collection in the world of
original "Jaws" memorabilia.

13:07.264 --> 13:08.297
- Hey, how you doing?
- How you doing, Chris?

13:08.298 --> 13:09.498
Pleasure to have you guys here.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.432
- Thank you.
- Hey, how are ya?

13:11.434 --> 13:13.335
<i>I'm sure if you're familiar
with the movie "Jaws,"</i>

13:13.336 --> 13:15.336
<i>you're gonna see a lot of
stuff here that you recognize.</i>

13:15.339 --> 13:18.340
We're looking to start him
on a road to collecting,

13:18.341 --> 13:19.674
and he wants to have a collection

13:19.677 --> 13:21.475
- that will rival yours one day.
- Wow.

13:21.477 --> 13:22.977
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:22.980 --> 13:25.013
I'll have a collection that rivals this...

13:25.014 --> 13:26.847
by the time I'm 82.

13:26.850 --> 13:28.517
- You'll have 35 years to...
- I couldn't possibly!

13:28.519 --> 13:31.153
He has all the, like,
one-of-a-kind, original stuff.

13:31.154 --> 13:33.288
[laughter]

13:33.289 --> 13:35.456
I'll never succeed. [laughter]

13:35.459 --> 13:37.326
There's a lot of stuff.

13:37.327 --> 13:39.027
This dude has a lot of stuff,

13:39.028 --> 13:40.796
like, the original props.

13:40.798 --> 13:42.831
Screen-used props.

13:42.832 --> 13:45.000
From "Jaws." You know how rare that is?

13:45.001 --> 13:47.269
That's Ra... that's as rare as a unicorn

13:47.270 --> 13:50.471
humping a Sasquatch while Martians look on.

13:50.474 --> 13:53.542
[all laugh]

13:53.543 --> 13:55.443
So what was the first piece you picked up?

13:55.446 --> 13:57.446
Um, the first piece was the harpoon gun.

13:57.447 --> 14:00.514
And at five years old, you
know, having the harpoon gun,

14:00.517 --> 14:02.616
of course you need the
barrels and the tank,

14:02.619 --> 14:04.186
and the list goes on and on.

14:04.187 --> 14:06.620
- Five years old?
- Yeah, my dad's actually

14:06.623 --> 14:08.322
the one who created the harpoon gun.

14:08.325 --> 14:09.658
And they just happened to, you know,

14:09.659 --> 14:11.158
rent it for the movie,

14:11.160 --> 14:13.227
and that's what started me on my quest.

14:13.230 --> 14:15.163
You were a five-year-old with
a functioning harpoon gun?

14:15.164 --> 14:17.231
- Yeah.
- [all laugh]

14:17.234 --> 14:18.332
I mean, I worked for it.

14:18.335 --> 14:19.668
It was a guerilla-made movie,

14:19.669 --> 14:21.135
so every time they shot something,

14:21.138 --> 14:22.370
they left it all behind.

14:22.373 --> 14:24.005
- Just like, trashing it?
- Yeah.

14:24.008 --> 14:25.340
The stuff just got discarded.

14:25.341 --> 14:27.908
It was, you know, valueless at the time.

14:27.911 --> 14:30.245
I went door to door, you
know, tracking stuff down,

14:30.246 --> 14:32.547
'cause there was no Internet,
there was no cell phones.

14:32.548 --> 14:35.683
It was almost like a
U.S.-wide scavenger hunt.

14:35.686 --> 14:36.985
Wow.

14:36.986 --> 14:38.854
So anything capture your fancy, Bry?

14:38.855 --> 14:41.222
You got some of the shark jaws.

14:41.225 --> 14:43.191
That's the stunt M1 Garand

14:43.192 --> 14:45.693
that was actually used when
Roy Scheider was up on the mast.

14:45.696 --> 14:47.229
You know, is that... is that
a first edition "Jaws" novel

14:47.230 --> 14:48.697
that Peter Benchley...

14:48.698 --> 14:50.432
Yep, and it's the only
cover he ever signed.

14:50.433 --> 14:51.899
What about the cage? Is that...

14:51.902 --> 14:53.501
Yeah, that's what's left of the cage.

14:53.504 --> 14:56.203
Uh, the pods on there, the
floatation, is not real.

14:56.206 --> 14:58.506
This flashlight, is that the
one with Ben... Ben Gardner?

14:58.509 --> 15:00.442
That's... no, actually,
that was Quint's flashlight

15:00.443 --> 15:01.676
that was actually thrown
up to him by the mate

15:01.677 --> 15:03.345
when they were leaving.

15:03.346 --> 15:05.947
- And that's Quint's jacket, hat.
- Quint's coat?

15:05.948 --> 15:07.515
This is the jacket that he wore?

15:07.518 --> 15:09.250
Yep, he actually wore that jacket,

15:09.253 --> 15:12.421
and that's the hero machete
that he used to stab the shark.

15:12.423 --> 15:13.955
Is that the hero beer?

15:13.956 --> 15:16.591
[all laugh]

15:16.592 --> 15:19.561
Personally, I think you'd be
crazy not to go after that coat.

15:19.562 --> 15:21.897
It does seem like a no-brainer, eh?

15:21.899 --> 15:23.432
I mean, is he allowed to... to put it on?

15:23.433 --> 15:24.698
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

15:24.701 --> 15:26.201
The actual costume?

15:26.202 --> 15:27.969
- Yes.
- Wow, man!

15:27.971 --> 15:29.471
That's like somebody going, like, "Here.

15:29.472 --> 15:31.740
Hold on to Darth Vader's lightsaber."

15:31.741 --> 15:34.076
Uh, I can't believe it's not in the, uh...

15:34.077 --> 15:35.976
- A museum! Why is this...
- Right? The Smithsonian.

15:35.979 --> 15:37.645
In the Smithsonian, yeah!

15:37.648 --> 15:40.148
This is the Smithsonian
of "Jaws" stuff, I guess.

15:40.149 --> 15:41.917
It belongs in the Kevin Smithsonian,

15:41.918 --> 15:43.684
I'll tell you that much right now!

15:45.120 --> 15:47.456
Oh. It says "R. Shaw" on it, look.

15:47.457 --> 15:49.323
- Robert Shaw.
- Oh, wow, man.

15:49.326 --> 15:50.926
- That's awesome.
- Man.

15:50.927 --> 15:52.326
- Whoa, careful, careful.
- If you were to tell

15:52.328 --> 15:53.961
third-grade Bryan Johnson

15:53.963 --> 15:56.063
that he'd get to wear this jacket one day?

15:56.066 --> 15:58.165
Your whole life might've been changed.

15:58.168 --> 15:59.500
- How does it look?
- Yeah.

15:59.503 --> 16:01.168
- It's actually kinda close.
- Yeah.

16:01.171 --> 16:02.770
- Yeah.
- There's a lot of blood...

16:02.773 --> 16:05.005
"It's got black eyes, like a doll's eyes."

16:05.008 --> 16:07.174
[all laugh]

16:07.177 --> 16:09.076
All right, what do you think, man?

16:09.078 --> 16:10.778
- Maybe $100?
- Oh, price?

16:10.780 --> 16:15.350
It would probably start
at probably about $80,000.

16:15.351 --> 16:17.786
- Wow.
- No! Really?

16:17.788 --> 16:19.788
I mean, if I knew that's
where the bidding started,

16:19.789 --> 16:21.456
I would've never even gotten in the car.

16:21.457 --> 16:23.390
[all laugh]

16:24.659 --> 16:26.027
You can't get discouraged.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.761
It doesn't mean you're...

16:27.764 --> 16:29.331
You're not gonna walk out
of here with something.

16:29.332 --> 16:31.032
- That's true, all right.
- This is the day

16:31.033 --> 16:33.501
that forever changes your life.

16:33.504 --> 16:34.668
You're in the ballpark, right?

16:34.671 --> 16:36.037
But you're not on the field.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.139
I'm outside the stadium still.

16:38.142 --> 16:39.774
I'm talking to a hot dog vendor.

16:39.775 --> 16:42.043
Do you have anything maybe
for the thrifty collector?

16:42.044 --> 16:43.879
You mean "destitute," right?

16:49.533 --> 16:52.667
I'm ranking the greatest
TV detectives ever,

16:52.668 --> 16:54.134
and I wanted to get some of your input.

16:54.136 --> 16:55.236
What are the parameters?

16:55.239 --> 16:56.571
- They had to be on TV.
- Okay.

16:56.572 --> 16:57.736
They had to be a detective.

16:57.744 --> 16:58.908
- Okay.
- There you go.

16:59.090 --> 17:00.174
[all laugh]

17:00.177 --> 17:02.076
- Magnum, P.I.
- Magnum, P.I.

17:02.078 --> 17:04.045
- Magnum, P.I., Tom Selleck.
- Tom Selleck.

17:04.047 --> 17:05.980
- He drove a cool car.
- It was a Ferrari, yeah.

17:05.982 --> 17:09.351
What was cooler, the 'stache or the car?

17:09.353 --> 17:10.719
This Stash? Oh, the mustache.

17:10.721 --> 17:12.252
[all laugh]

17:12.256 --> 17:14.422
Okay... ah, jeez. That's... that's tough.

17:14.423 --> 17:16.656
Who didn't want that mustache?
I mean, I tried so hard

17:16.660 --> 17:18.425
to grow out that luscious 'stache,

17:18.428 --> 17:21.323
and mine was just so weak
and... and... and flimsy.

17:21.324 --> 17:24.057
It was just... that's hard to
do, get a 'stache like that.

17:24.059 --> 17:25.659
- Oh, yeah, definitely.
- Ooh.

17:25.661 --> 17:26.894
Mike, you're getting there though!

17:26.895 --> 17:28.662
- Yeah.
- [all laugh]

17:28.663 --> 17:30.196
What about you?

17:30.199 --> 17:32.031
I would go Jim Rockford.

17:32.034 --> 17:33.366
- [laughs]
- Whoa.

17:33.368 --> 17:34.367
I thought for sure you would've

17:34.369 --> 17:38.505
went with Starsky and Hutch.

17:38.507 --> 17:40.740
That's why, you know, I
show you guys so much love

17:40.742 --> 17:42.675
- and so much, like, camaraderie.
- Yeah.

17:42.677 --> 17:44.510
Because, you know, I learned
it through "Starsky & Hutch."

17:44.512 --> 17:46.079
He learned it through "Magnum, P.I."

17:46.082 --> 17:48.348
Giving Ming mustache rides all the time.

17:48.351 --> 17:51.085
[all laugh]

17:51.086 --> 17:53.420
Oh! Oh, my God!

17:54.622 --> 17:58.424
<i>♪
♪</i>

17:58.426 --> 17:59.926
You didn't start off with
all this stuff, right?

17:59.929 --> 18:01.327
You had to start off with one piece,

18:01.329 --> 18:03.763
- one step at at time.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

18:03.766 --> 18:05.798
I'm still picking up stuff to this day.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.035
Exactly. You work your way up.

18:08.037 --> 18:09.269
All right.

18:09.270 --> 18:10.938
Welcome to the collecting game, Big.

18:10.940 --> 18:14.040
He doesn't yet know the joy
of the journey, you know?

18:14.042 --> 18:15.843
You start small, and one day?

18:15.845 --> 18:18.011
You might have a healthy, vital collection.

18:18.013 --> 18:19.346
If he walks out of there

18:19.347 --> 18:21.115
with something that he can proudly display,

18:21.115 --> 18:23.348
this could be a life-changing moment.

18:23.351 --> 18:25.317
Healthier living, through "Jaws."

18:25.320 --> 18:27.721
[all laugh]

18:27.722 --> 18:29.556
What else do we got that might be, uh...

18:29.557 --> 18:31.357
- Oh, yeah.
- More suited to a man...

18:31.359 --> 18:32.960
- Of this budget?
- Yeah.

18:32.961 --> 18:34.961
- We have a tank.
- What does that go for?

18:34.963 --> 18:36.896
- Probably $50,000.
- Oh, wow.

18:36.898 --> 18:39.532
- What about the harpoon gun?
- $100,000.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.167
- More than the jacket?
- Oh, yeah.

18:41.170 --> 18:43.069
The machete, probably 20 grand.

18:43.072 --> 18:45.538
The M1 Garand, $18,000.

18:45.540 --> 18:47.207
What about the empty can of beer?

18:47.209 --> 18:49.175
Empty can would probably go 6 grand.

18:49.177 --> 18:50.743
- Oh.
- Wow.

18:50.746 --> 18:52.546
Right, well, you're in the ballpark, right?

18:52.548 --> 18:54.213
But you're not on the field.

18:54.215 --> 18:56.517
- I'm outside the stadium still.
- Just the parking lot.

18:56.519 --> 18:58.152
I'm talking to a hot dog vendor.

18:58.153 --> 18:59.653
Maybe we move down and see

18:59.654 --> 19:02.355
if there's something else perhaps that...

19:02.357 --> 19:03.824
Well, in the next case we have

19:03.826 --> 19:05.925
most of the original
pieces from the "Orca."

19:05.928 --> 19:07.326
Something tells me the "Orca,"

19:07.328 --> 19:09.529
it's not cheaper than the can of beer.

19:09.531 --> 19:11.065
[all laugh]

19:11.067 --> 19:12.365
What about one of those beat-up barrels?

19:12.367 --> 19:13.901
- They can't go for much.
- [scoffs]

19:13.903 --> 19:15.368
Oh, yeah, these barrels
would probably start

19:15.371 --> 19:16.603
at auction about $20,000.

19:16.605 --> 19:18.005
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:18.007 --> 19:20.173
So that's $100,000 in barrels...

19:20.175 --> 19:23.076
[laughter] Sitting right there.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.711
I'm watching Bryan, you know,

19:24.712 --> 19:26.547
get priced out on every single thing.

19:26.548 --> 19:28.449
Yeah, it's like, "I want to collect 'Jaws.'

19:28.451 --> 19:31.384
Just not that, that,
that, that, none of these."

19:31.386 --> 19:32.786
I am determined,

19:32.788 --> 19:35.556
he is gonna walk out
of there with something.

19:35.557 --> 19:38.125
You're going to snatch victory
from the jaws of defeat.

19:38.125 --> 19:39.858
Ooh. [laughter]

19:39.861 --> 19:42.095
What about, like, a shirt?
What does a shirt go for?

19:42.096 --> 19:44.063
That's an original cast production shirt.

19:44.065 --> 19:46.199
Probably start at $3,000.

19:46.201 --> 19:47.800
- Ooh.
- Wow.

19:47.802 --> 19:50.136
Do you have anything maybe
for the thrifty collector?

19:50.138 --> 19:52.038
By "thrifty," you mean "destitute," right?

19:52.040 --> 19:54.074
[all laugh]

19:54.076 --> 19:55.741
So you can't get the Quint jacket.

19:55.743 --> 19:57.044
You can't get the harpoon gun.

19:57.046 --> 19:58.244
You can't get a barrel.

19:58.247 --> 19:59.712
Just when things were looking hairy,

19:59.714 --> 20:02.115
Chris found something for
us and Bryan walked home

20:02.117 --> 20:05.085
with his very first piece
of "Jaws" merchandise.

20:05.086 --> 20:06.553
Nice! What is it?

20:09.624 --> 20:11.959
That is the baddest-ass thimble

20:11.961 --> 20:14.494
that's ever been produced.

20:14.497 --> 20:16.230
I mean, the only other one I've ever seen

20:16.231 --> 20:17.897
is in a Monopoly game, so...

20:17.900 --> 20:20.666
[all laugh]

20:20.669 --> 20:22.669
No! Really?

20:22.671 --> 20:24.837
- Yeah.
- You're like the Little Tailor.

20:24.839 --> 20:26.405
It's the small steps.

20:26.407 --> 20:29.242
I mean, you... you have to...
You have to start somewhere.

20:29.244 --> 20:30.911
- That's true, man.
- You never know.

20:30.913 --> 20:33.346
You may have a barrel one day.

20:33.348 --> 20:34.647
Or a sewing box.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.450
[all laugh]

20:36.451 --> 20:37.683
I just love how you went in there

20:37.685 --> 20:39.286
trying to get a big collectible,

20:39.288 --> 20:41.922
and you bought literally
the smallest thing in there.

20:41.923 --> 20:46.259
- Do you love it?
- [all laugh]

20:46.261 --> 20:49.462
Oh, and just like Cap'n Quint,
it's all over for us, man.

20:49.464 --> 20:51.098
For "Comic Book Men," I'm Kevin Smith.

20:51.098 --> 20:52.499
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.000
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.801
We're gonna need a bigger boat, kids.

20:55.804 --> 20:56.885
Good night.
