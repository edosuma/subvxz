{ Bridgit Mendler:
This Is My Paradise}

01:07.496 --> 01:09.691
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:09.732 --> 01:15.295
we are here today to celebrate the union
of two very special individuals.

01:15.337 --> 01:21.242
Two souls that shall become one
and shine only more brightly together.

01:22.011 --> 01:25.970
- I can't believe this day is here.
- Won't you please join me

01:26.015 --> 01:29.610
in bringing together in marriage
a much beloved couple...

01:31.954 --> 01:33.683
Chloe and Papi.

01:37.860 --> 01:42.092
- Oh, Papi.
- Ay, Chihuahua.

01:42.131 --> 01:44.929
Oh, I'm just so happy for them.

01:44.967 --> 01:46.730
{sighs} Me, too.

01:46.769 --> 01:49.704
Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.

01:49.738 --> 01:51.638
You may all be seated.

01:52.641 --> 01:54.472
{dogs whining}

01:55.444 --> 01:56.468
Sit.

01:59.348 --> 02:04.251
Chloe and Papi,
do you take each other to love and honor

02:04.286 --> 02:08.689
in good times and bad,
in wet nose and dry nose,

02:08.723 --> 02:11.249
as long as you both shall live?

02:12.394 --> 02:13.793
{gulps}

02:13.829 --> 02:16.662
- I do.
- I do.

02:17.867 --> 02:19.334
{Papi barks}

02:19.368 --> 02:23.031
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

02:24.874 --> 02:26.432
You may lick the bride.

02:28.410 --> 02:29.536
{guests applaud}

02:43.459 --> 02:45.017
{Spanish music plays}

02:49.431 --> 02:50.455
{cork pops}

03:05.314 --> 03:07.441
A toast to the newlyweds.

03:07.483 --> 03:11.078
They're perfect together,
like Romeo and Juliet.

03:11.120 --> 03:15.056
- Or Dolce & Gabbana.
- Or me and this cake.

03:15.090 --> 03:16.955
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

03:19.962 --> 03:21.987
{man} Hey, guys. How you doing?

03:25.067 --> 03:26.091
{hiccups}

03:26.569 --> 03:28.264
Oh. Thank you so much.

03:28.304 --> 03:30.169
{indistinct conversation}

03:30.873 --> 03:32.636
Aunt Viv, you outdid yourself.

03:32.675 --> 03:35.235
This is the most spectacular wedding
I've ever been to.

03:35.277 --> 03:38.178
{sighs} Rachel, isn't it
just perfection?

03:38.213 --> 03:40.875
Sam, I love the
bougainvillea arches.

03:40.916 --> 03:43.578
And the rosebush topiaries,
they're flawless.

03:43.619 --> 03:46.087
You are a landscaping genius.

03:46.121 --> 03:48.749
Thanks, Viv. You know, I really wanted
to do something special

03:48.791 --> 03:50.816
for your Chloe and my Papi
on their big day.

03:50.859 --> 03:53.987
- Only the best for my little girl.
- Oh, cheers.

03:54.029 --> 03:58.295
Besides, I wanna spoil her rotten before
I have to leave her for so long.

03:58.334 --> 03:59.562
I can't believe you and Rachel

03:59.602 --> 04:03.094
are gonna be spending
six months in the rainforest.

04:03.138 --> 04:04.730
I mean, that's pretty intense.

04:04.773 --> 04:06.798
Are you kidding?
We are gonna have so much fun.

04:06.842 --> 04:10.005
We're gonna be looking for
rare plants that could cure diseases.

04:10.045 --> 04:12.878
And you know I love an adventure.

04:12.915 --> 04:16.248
Well, I promise to take good care
of the dogs while you guys are away.

04:16.285 --> 04:17.684
{both} Thank you.

04:17.720 --> 04:21.382
Speaking of which,
today is about Chloe and Papi.

04:21.423 --> 04:24.358
So, come on. It's time to celebrate.
Let's dance!

04:24.393 --> 04:25.951
Let's dance.

04:27.363 --> 04:29.524
Oh, there goes my diet.

04:30.966 --> 04:32.866
{Spanish music plays}

04:40.809 --> 04:42.868
{sings in Spanish}

04:42.911 --> 04:44.708
I love this song.

04:44.747 --> 04:46.908
{howling to song}

04:54.323 --> 04:57.019
I never thought my dog
would get married before me.

04:57.059 --> 05:00.085
Well, maybe it'll be me and you walking
down that aisle one day.

05:00.129 --> 05:03.098
I'd like that very much, Rachel.
Some day.

05:03.132 --> 05:05.532
- Some day?
- Some day.

05:24.086 --> 05:27.487
I call this move the Chihuahua Waltz.

05:28.290 --> 05:30.417
You are so light on your paws,
mi corazon.

05:30.459 --> 05:32.825
You're not so bad yourself, my love.

05:32.861 --> 05:38.060
Tonight my heart is bursting.
I am the happiest dog alive!

05:38.100 --> 05:41.365
And I'm the luckiest girl ever.

05:41.403 --> 05:43.462
- Oh, look!
- What is it?

05:43.505 --> 05:46.941
A shooting star!
Quick, make a wish.

05:47.309 --> 05:51.211
What more could I ask for, mi corazon?
What do you wish for?

05:51.246 --> 05:56.684
- Well, what about a family?
- Family?

05:56.719 --> 05:57.981
Ay, Chihuahua.

05:59.088 --> 06:01.283
{Papi} Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi!

06:01.323 --> 06:03.086
{up-tempo music}

06:05.160 --> 06:06.559
Geronimo!

06:06.595 --> 06:08.187
Whoa!

06:08.230 --> 06:09.458
Whoo-hoo!

06:10.099 --> 06:12.567
Watch and see how it's done, everyone.

06:13.469 --> 06:15.460
Whee!

06:15.504 --> 06:16.562
{giggles}

06:17.072 --> 06:18.505
I'm next, I'm next!

06:18.540 --> 06:20.701
- Me, me, me, me, me!
- Do it! Do it!

06:20.743 --> 06:23.405
Look out below! Yeah!

06:24.513 --> 06:27.175
Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Hoo-hoo!

06:27.216 --> 06:33.052
- Oh, no. What are you kids doing?
- Look out, Lala. Here I come!

06:33.088 --> 06:35.147
Don't you dare, Papi, Jr.

06:35.190 --> 06:37.249
Whoo-hoo!

06:37.292 --> 06:38.691
Yeah!

06:39.862 --> 06:44.299
- Gee... I must've slipped.
- Oh! You kids are a mess.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.961
I told you I wanted you clean
for the dog park.

06:47.402 --> 06:50.769
I don't know where your father is,
but when he hears about this,

06:50.806 --> 06:53.832
- he is gonna be so mad.
- lncoming!

06:53.876 --> 06:56.208
Let me show you how the big dogs do it!

06:56.578 --> 06:59.706
Whoo, hoo-hoo!

07:00.449 --> 07:02.041
Oh!

07:02.618 --> 07:03.812
{growls}

07:03.852 --> 07:08.482
Oh, my love. I didn't see you there.
Come on in. It's really fun.

07:08.524 --> 07:11.118
Oh! Look at me. I'm covered in mud.

07:11.160 --> 07:15.460
Don't you usually pay for a mud mask?
This one's free!

07:15.497 --> 07:18.625
{sighs} You kids
get right into the bath.

07:18.667 --> 07:21.101
- But Mom, do we have to?
- I don't wanna take a bath.

07:21.136 --> 07:25.266
Bath now. Or no bacon-wrapped
filet mignon for dessert.

07:25.307 --> 07:27.537
- OK.
- OK.

07:28.710 --> 07:32.111
Papi, why do I always
have to be the bad guy?

07:32.147 --> 07:34.513
Because you're so good at it?

07:34.550 --> 07:38.145
I had a litter of five puppies, not six.

07:38.187 --> 07:41.520
You need to start being their father,
not their playmate.

07:42.090 --> 07:44.650
{groans} I better go get washed up.

07:44.927 --> 07:48.693
lf I didn't know any better,
I would think I was in the doghouse.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.263
{whistling}

07:54.002 --> 07:56.493
All right, everyone.
Who's up for the dog park?

07:56.538 --> 07:57.732
{barking}

07:57.773 --> 07:59.104
- We are!
- Hey, Sam.

07:59.141 --> 08:01.041
We're all waiting on you.
Let's go, fool!

08:01.076 --> 08:02.134
Come on, puppies!

08:05.781 --> 08:07.976
{Papi} Rosa, Lala,

08:08.016 --> 08:11.884
Pep, Ali, you're
all as beautiful as your mother.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.014
- {girls} Thanks, Daddy.
- Where's Papi, Jr.?

08:15.057 --> 08:18.549
- Papi, Jr.?
- {Papi, Jr.} I'm not coming out.

08:18.594 --> 08:22.553
- Come on, buddy. Let's see your outfit.
- {Papi, Jr.} This is so embarrassing.

08:22.598 --> 08:25.260
I'm sure you look great. Let's see.

08:26.835 --> 08:28.359
I look ridiculous.

08:28.403 --> 08:31.372
Ay! You're right.
You do look ridiculous.

08:31.406 --> 08:32.429
{girls giggle}

08:32.474 --> 08:34.908
{Papi} No son of mine
is gonna wear clothes like that.

08:34.943 --> 08:38.037
{Chloe} Oh, Papi.
But he looks so handsome.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.775
- {growls}
- {all laughing}

08:42.116 --> 08:44.881
- There. It's dead now. Let's go.
- Thanks, Dad.

08:44.920 --> 08:47.787
{Chloe} Come on, puppies.
Off to the dog park.

08:48.423 --> 08:52.189
{mid-tempo music}

08:52.594 --> 08:54.255
{chatter}

08:59.434 --> 09:00.628
{barking}

09:00.669 --> 09:02.227
Yay! We're here!

09:02.271 --> 09:06.037
Here we are. You guys
are gonna love this place.

09:06.642 --> 09:08.371
But be on your best behavior.

09:08.410 --> 09:11.641
{Chloe} That's right.
This place is very exclusive.

09:13.015 --> 09:14.141
{woman} Your bone, sir.

09:14.583 --> 09:18.713
Ah, a vintage '03.
A most excellent year.

09:20.689 --> 09:22.179
{man} Ready to launch.

09:23.625 --> 09:25.388
- And... paw!
- {beeping}

09:25.961 --> 09:27.223
Fetch, boy. Fetch.

09:27.262 --> 09:29.992
{man} Bow wow. Bow wow.

09:30.732 --> 09:35.431
So I said, ''Honey, I only chase
imported cars.'' Zing!

09:35.470 --> 09:37.267
{man} Lunch is served.

09:38.206 --> 09:40.140
- Hi, everyone!
- Chloe!

09:40.175 --> 09:43.804
You have to join us.
This sushi is faboo!

09:43.845 --> 09:45.574
Looks delish!

09:45.614 --> 09:50.176
Not as delish as that
retriever over there. Growl.

09:50.218 --> 09:53.483
Where're the kids? I thought
you brought the little ones.

09:53.522 --> 09:57.458
- Oh, Papi's watching them.
- {laughs} But who's watching Papi?

09:57.492 --> 09:59.084
{puppies laughing}

09:59.127 --> 10:00.389
Go, Dad!

10:01.163 --> 10:05.497
OK, kids. Today we practice
the time-honored tradition of digging.

10:05.534 --> 10:10.995
It is a skill that every dog must know.
We dig in order to stay grounded.

10:11.473 --> 10:12.997
I love dirt!

10:13.041 --> 10:15.703
OK. Ready? Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right.

10:17.179 --> 10:19.272
- Left, right. Left, right.
- {Rosa} Look at me! This is fun.

10:19.314 --> 10:20.440
- {Papi} Left, right.
- {Ali} I'm pretty good.

10:20.482 --> 10:21.506
I love digging!

10:21.550 --> 10:23.074
{speaks Spanish}

10:23.118 --> 10:26.849
Dig, my puppies.
Dig with passion. Dig with love.

10:26.888 --> 10:30.187
Dig as if you were burying your
favorite bone.

10:30.225 --> 10:32.591
- Ahh!
- {speaks French}

10:32.661 --> 10:35.562
Oh, you idiots. You got me dirty!

10:35.597 --> 10:37.622
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

10:37.666 --> 10:42.262
Pardon me, senorita. My kids got a
little carried away with their digging.

10:43.538 --> 10:47.167
- And who said you could speak to me?
- Uh-oh. It's her again.

10:47.209 --> 10:49.234
I'll be right back.

10:49.277 --> 10:53.077
Well, you look like a stray.
How did you even get in here?

10:53.115 --> 10:56.710
- Papi, what's going on?
- {dog speaks French}

10:56.752 --> 10:58.982
As if there weren't
enough of you peasants.

10:59.021 --> 11:01.182
Oh, enough with that fake accent.

11:01.223 --> 11:03.316
Everyone knows you're from the Valley.

11:03.358 --> 11:07.158
{scoffs} Your little fluff balls
ruined my perm.

11:07.195 --> 11:11.996
lf there's a problem here, you say it
to me, but leave my kids out of it.

11:12.034 --> 11:13.160
Easy, mama bear.

11:13.201 --> 11:17.069
She's just all mad 'cause
she looks like a big, angry Q-tip.

11:17.105 --> 11:18.697
- Oh!
- {woman} No, no, no, no, no!

11:18.740 --> 11:20.867
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo, shoo!

11:20.909 --> 11:22.274
Leave my dog alone.

11:23.011 --> 11:24.035
Scoundrels!

11:24.079 --> 11:27.845
Excuse me, I think we all
just got off on the wrong paw.

11:27.883 --> 11:30.681
- Whoa. Is there a problem here?
- {sighs}

11:30.719 --> 11:34.485
You know, this park is
for Beverly Hills residents only.

11:34.523 --> 11:36.889
Don't you have dog parks
where you live?

11:36.925 --> 11:39.826
- Hey, we have a right to be here.
- Really?

11:39.861 --> 11:41.726
Well then keep your little animals

11:41.763 --> 11:45.028
away from Mademoiselle
Marie Appoline Bouvier.

11:45.067 --> 11:46.261
{speaks French}

11:46.301 --> 11:50.203
She is a prizewinning show dog.
Aren't you, baby?

11:50.939 --> 11:55.273
And a three-time champion
of the Beverly Hills Dog Show.

11:55.310 --> 11:57.039
{techno music plays}

12:00.515 --> 12:02.039
She can't handle stress.

12:03.218 --> 12:04.947
Then how does she handle you?

12:04.986 --> 12:08.717
Ha-ha! Somebody get some ice
for that burn. Whoop!

12:08.757 --> 12:11.385
Come, Appoline. We're done here.

12:11.426 --> 12:14.827
{speaking French}

12:15.697 --> 12:17.096
Friendly.

12:17.999 --> 12:21.992
Hey, Mademoiselle, don't look now,
but somebody shaved your heinie!

12:22.037 --> 12:24.062
- {Appoline} Oh!
- {laughing}

12:24.106 --> 12:26.097
Oh, Papi, you're terrible.

12:31.213 --> 12:35.081
Well, my little bandidos,
you've had a very full day.

12:35.117 --> 12:36.675
{speaks Spanish}

12:36.718 --> 12:39.846
Can't we stay up ten more minutes, Papa?

12:39.888 --> 12:41.116
- {all} Please?
- Tell us a story!

12:41.156 --> 12:43.021
- {Ali} Come on.
- OK. Settle down now.

12:43.058 --> 12:45.754
I promised your mother
I would put you to bed.

12:45.794 --> 12:49.924
She is the love of my life, and I would
do anything to make her happy.

12:49.965 --> 12:54.334
- Gross. No more love talk.
- Your mother is everything to me.

12:54.369 --> 12:56.963
I remember the first time
we rubbed noses.

12:57.005 --> 12:59.473
- Eww! Yuck.
- Eww. Grody.

12:59.508 --> 13:02.272
Dad, who wants to hear about love?

13:02.310 --> 13:06.747
What? Love is the most important
thing in the world.

13:06.781 --> 13:10.376
Let me tell you a story
about your great ancestors.

13:11.520 --> 13:12.987
Now listen to this.

13:13.855 --> 13:16.722
Long ago in ancient times...

13:17.926 --> 13:22.022
...inside the huge temples
there were hidden tunnels

13:22.063 --> 13:26.932
built just for Chihuahuas
to carry messages for their humans.

13:26.968 --> 13:28.196
{Spanish music plays}

13:28.236 --> 13:29.760
{dog barks}

13:29.905 --> 13:31.896
{Papi} The Chihuahuas
were trusted to carry

13:31.940 --> 13:35.239
the most precious secrets
to their kingdoms.

13:36.411 --> 13:40.279
Sometimes, they were messages of love.

13:44.886 --> 13:49.186
The Chihuahuas faced great danger
to deliver these messages

13:49.224 --> 13:51.522
and did so proudly.

13:58.200 --> 14:02.068
They knew true love is worth any risk.

14:04.539 --> 14:07.064
Now, my little Chihuahua Warriors,

14:07.108 --> 14:11.568
love fearlessly, and help others
share their hearts as well.

14:12.347 --> 14:14.508
- Good night.
- Good night, Daddy.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.540
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Dad.

14:16.585 --> 14:18.416
Good night, Papa.

14:18.453 --> 14:19.852
{pop music plays}

14:28.096 --> 14:31.429
Mi amor, you can soak
as long as you want.

14:31.466 --> 14:34.299
The children are asleep, like angels.

14:34.336 --> 14:38.033
Oh. That sounds wonderful.

14:38.073 --> 14:43.477
Oh, yes. Just go ahead and relax
all night. Papi has done the deed.

14:44.179 --> 14:45.874
{whistling}

14:45.914 --> 14:49.577
{sighs} You want me to look
at them sleeping, don't you?

14:49.618 --> 14:51.313
Yes. Very much.

14:51.786 --> 14:53.310
- {puppies shouting}
- {cloth tearing}

14:53.355 --> 14:55.721
Oh! What is going on in here?

14:55.757 --> 14:56.883
{glass shattering}

15:01.296 --> 15:03.890
We're digging tunnels to carry
our messages of love.

15:03.932 --> 15:07.766
- Yep. We sure are.
- It's so romantic.

15:08.770 --> 15:10.738
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

15:10.772 --> 15:15.004
I wonder where the kids could get
an idea like that, Papi?

15:15.043 --> 15:18.945
- I have no idea. Right, kids?
- {Pep} Look at me!

15:18.980 --> 15:21.608
We got them from your story, silly.

15:21.650 --> 15:25.950
- Yeah. Dad told us all about it.
- Thanks, rats. I mean ''kids.''

15:25.987 --> 15:30.856
Papi, I sent you up here to put them
to bed, not to rile them up.

15:30.892 --> 15:33.122
But I didn't wanna ruin their fun.

15:33.161 --> 15:36.688
Besides, they're just puppies.
They don't know any better.

15:36.731 --> 15:41.862
{Chloe} So, it's up to us to teach them.
You can't be afraid to discipline them.

15:41.903 --> 15:45.634
Afraid? I'm not afraid.
I just don't like that part.

15:45.674 --> 15:49.371
OK, I want everyone in bed
this minute.

15:49.411 --> 15:52.778
- OK.
- OK.

15:52.814 --> 15:55.146
I'm digging fast. Try and beat me.

15:55.183 --> 15:58.550
Don't make me put you back
in that sailor outfit, Papi, Jr.

15:58.586 --> 16:01.180
Oh, look at the time. Good night.

16:01.222 --> 16:03.486
{Chloe} Come on.
Everyone off to bed. Let's go.

16:03.525 --> 16:04.617
- Sorry, Mama.
- Sorry, Mama.

16:04.659 --> 16:05.853
Sorry, Mama.

16:06.761 --> 16:09.355
This dad business is harder
than I thought.

16:09.964 --> 16:11.864
I shoulda read the manual.

16:22.477 --> 16:23.501
What is...

16:24.979 --> 16:26.776
Hey, I...

16:27.782 --> 16:29.477
OK, OK. I'm up.

16:30.085 --> 16:32.519
- {dogs barking}
- I'm up.

16:34.856 --> 16:37.518
I know you guys are excited about
meeting my side of the family today,

16:37.559 --> 16:39.584
but at least let me get dressed first.

16:39.627 --> 16:41.185
{pop music plays}

16:55.543 --> 16:59.001
So, what do you guys think of
where your dad and I grew up?

16:59.047 --> 17:00.071
{barking}

17:00.115 --> 17:04.711
- Ah. So many great memories.
- Oh, Papi. It's so colorful.

17:04.752 --> 17:06.220
- Wow, Dad.
- This is so cool.

17:06.253 --> 17:09.781
Oh, look, kids. Over there.
That's Dad's first fire hydrant.

17:09.824 --> 17:11.290
{all} Wow!

17:11.326 --> 17:13.657
Ooh! I got a bone hidden right there.

17:13.694 --> 17:15.788
{puppies exclaiming}

17:15.829 --> 17:18.458
{Papi} Hey, Junior!
What's going on? It's Papi!

17:18.500 --> 17:19.762
{Papi, Jr.} Hi!

17:21.469 --> 17:23.368
{Ali} lce cream!
Can we get some ice cream, Dad?

17:23.405 --> 17:26.396
- {girls} Yeah, ice cream!
- {Chloe} Now, kids...

17:26.441 --> 17:30.172
All in good time, kids.
First, you must meet my family.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.556
- Hey, guys. We're here.
- Wow. Home sweet home.

17:42.590 --> 17:44.251
Come on, kids! Vamanos!

17:44.292 --> 17:47.352
- Yay! We're here!
- {Sam} Hey, Ma!

17:49.330 --> 17:51.696
- Ha-ha! Papi's home.
- Hey, Dad!

17:51.733 --> 17:53.257
Come meet your grandpuppies!

17:54.302 --> 17:56.964
- {speaks Spanish}
- Hey.

17:59.140 --> 18:00.539
{Sam} Here you guys go.

18:02.110 --> 18:03.839
- {speaks Spanish}
- Hey.

18:05.146 --> 18:07.171
Pedro! Come here, boy!

18:07.215 --> 18:08.739
Come, come, come!

18:09.551 --> 18:11.451
Meet your nieces and nephew, eh?

18:11.953 --> 18:12.977
- Hi, there.
- Hello.

18:13.021 --> 18:15.421
- Hi, there.
- {puppies screaming}

18:15.457 --> 18:16.754
It's a Chupacabra!

18:16.791 --> 18:17.917
- He's gonna eat us!
- Help us!

18:17.959 --> 18:19.984
- Run for your lives!
- It's Dogzilla!

18:20.028 --> 18:22.292
- Run!
- Help!

18:22.330 --> 18:23.354
Huh?

18:23.398 --> 18:28.461
- Bro, you gotta work on that smile.
- That was a smile?

18:28.503 --> 18:33.304
Chloe, kids, I'd like you to meet,
mi hermano, Pedro.

18:33.341 --> 18:35.002
- Give me some paw.
- Up high.

18:35.977 --> 18:37.171
What?

18:37.212 --> 18:38.236
Huh?

18:38.746 --> 18:41.874
- Hi, everyone.
- Hmm?

18:41.916 --> 18:44.976
Oh, Pedro. It's so good
to finally meet you.

18:45.019 --> 18:48.853
Chloe, you are even lovelier
than I imagined.

18:48.890 --> 18:53.088
I'm sorry I was not here to greet you.
I saw a butterfly in the yard

18:53.127 --> 18:55.493
whose wing was caught
in a blade of grass,

18:55.530 --> 18:58.226
and I had to blow on it to set it free.

18:58.266 --> 19:02.566
How can you and Dad be brothers?
You don't look anything alike.

19:02.604 --> 19:07.507
They're not real brothers, silly.
They grew up on the streets together.

19:07.542 --> 19:10.807
That doesn't make our brotherhood
any less real, kids.

19:10.845 --> 19:15.748
Family is about who you love,
not just who you're born to.

19:15.783 --> 19:17.546
Well said, mi hermano.

19:17.952 --> 19:20.386
- {water running}
- Dad, what are these?

19:20.421 --> 19:22.480
- {water shuts off}
- {guitar playing}

19:28.162 --> 19:29.493
What are all these bills?

19:32.600 --> 19:34.295
We should tell him, Fernando.

19:35.670 --> 19:37.365
Tell me what?

19:37.405 --> 19:41.671
You kids go in the backyard and play.
It's time for the adults to talk.

19:41.709 --> 19:42.733
Ma!

19:42.911 --> 19:46.176
- Do we have to?
- Now. Off you go.

19:46.214 --> 19:48.045
- {Pep} Oh, man.
- No fair.

19:48.082 --> 19:49.947
{Lala} Yeah,
what's the big secret, anyway?

19:49.984 --> 19:51.008
{puppies} Yeah?

19:51.052 --> 19:52.883
Why don't the adults go outside?

19:52.921 --> 19:55.082
- Not us.
- Wait for me!

19:55.823 --> 19:58.849
I haven't been able
to make the mortgage payments, mijo.

19:58.893 --> 20:03.557
I mean, an eviction letter?
Dad, why didn't you tell me?

20:03.598 --> 20:06.123
I thought I could catch up
with the payments.

20:06.167 --> 20:07.862
The man came from the bank.

20:07.902 --> 20:11.201
- What are they saying, Papi, Jr.?
- {grunts}

20:11.239 --> 20:15.198
I can't see. Wait. I got an idea.

20:15.243 --> 20:17.370
What about all the money
from the landscaping jobs?

20:17.412 --> 20:19.972
Ever since I threw my back out,
I haven't been able to work.

20:20.014 --> 20:24.246
We've lost a lot of jobs
with the company down to just you, hijo.

20:24.285 --> 20:25.479
{faint bark}

20:25.520 --> 20:27.852
There's gotta be somebody we can
ask to borrow the money from.

20:27.889 --> 20:30.449
Hold still! {grunting}

20:30.491 --> 20:33.949
Pee-yew! Your paws smell.

20:33.995 --> 20:37.829
Can you hurry, Papi, Jr.?
I have to tinkle.

20:37.865 --> 20:43.565
- Don't even think about it, Ali.
- Guys, shh. I'm trying to listen.

20:43.605 --> 20:46.005
- What about Viv?
- No.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.632
No, no, no, no, no.

20:47.675 --> 20:50.371
We will not burden anyone
with our problems.

20:50.411 --> 20:51.969
This is a family affair.

20:52.013 --> 20:55.813
Uh-oh.
I can't hold you guys much longer.

20:55.850 --> 20:57.442
{all} Whoa!

20:57.485 --> 20:58.747
Oh, no!

20:59.454 --> 21:00.978
- We're going down!
- {all shouting}

21:01.022 --> 21:02.353
{grunts}

21:04.559 --> 21:06.925
What did you find out, Papi, Jr.?

21:06.961 --> 21:11.364
Not much. But, I did find out
where Pedro likes to poop.

21:11.399 --> 21:12.889
Pee-yew!

21:13.534 --> 21:16.094
The Cortezes have always pulled
themselves up.

21:16.137 --> 21:19.664
- What if we can't?
- We will lose the house.

21:19.707 --> 21:21.504
What?

21:21.542 --> 21:25.911
Well, your mother and I will have
to go live with my sister and her family

21:25.947 --> 21:28.916
- in Arizona.
- It's so far.

21:30.585 --> 21:31.950
I'll never see you guys.

21:31.986 --> 21:35.444
And they live in that tiny little
apartment. I mean, what about Pedro?

21:35.490 --> 21:36.889
{whines}

21:36.924 --> 21:38.551
Oh, my heart is breaking.

21:38.593 --> 21:41.027
It's only until
we can save some money.

21:42.563 --> 21:46.590
We'll go to the bank first thing
in the morning. It's gonna be OK.

21:48.736 --> 21:52.194
- Good.
- They can't lose this place.

21:52.240 --> 21:53.969
This was my first home.

21:54.008 --> 21:57.171
Before this house,
we were on the streets.

22:00.148 --> 22:02.013
Find anything in there, Papi?

22:02.684 --> 22:06.415
Just this stylish hat.
Hey, Pedro, I'm hungry.

22:06.454 --> 22:09.355
- {man} Hey, you mutts, get out of here!
- It's him again! Run!

22:12.627 --> 22:16.222
{Papi} Yep.
Life on the streets was no picnic.

22:17.799 --> 22:20.563
But then one day, all that changed...

22:21.369 --> 22:24.133
...when Sam and his parents adopted us.

22:24.706 --> 22:27.140
Suddenly, we had a family.

22:28.443 --> 22:31.879
Papi, I know how much
this home means to you.

22:31.913 --> 22:34.882
- To all of us.
- They gave us a home.

22:34.916 --> 22:38.875
Now we gotta do everything we can
to help them keep it.

22:43.758 --> 22:46.352
Oh, yes, Cortez.

22:46.894 --> 22:50.523
Gentlemen, I'd really like
to help you out, but my hands are tied.

22:50.565 --> 22:53.159
You're just too far behind
on your payments.

22:53.201 --> 22:54.998
- What are we gonna do? I don't...
- {Papi barks}

22:55.036 --> 22:57.937
Try begging, Sam.
It works when I want your burrito.

22:57.972 --> 23:01.533
{groans} Didn't realize
you brought your dog.

23:01.576 --> 23:05.740
Fun. I'm really more of
a cat person myself.

23:06.347 --> 23:08.008
Huh? Hmm?

23:08.049 --> 23:11.644
- Little Prince Albert.
- Oh, now I know what's wrong with you.

23:11.686 --> 23:13.881
lsn't he a cutie?

23:13.921 --> 23:19.291
Look, sir, this is our home.
Our life is there.

23:19.327 --> 23:22.262
- Our memories.
- Our squeaky toys.

23:22.296 --> 23:27.563
Well, memories don't pay the bills.
Now, you've received your final notice

23:27.602 --> 23:30.469
and once that happens the bank can only
give you till the end of the month.

23:30.505 --> 23:33.736
Now, that's... for you, let's see,
that means you have three weeks

23:33.775 --> 23:35.072
to come up with...

23:35.109 --> 23:37.771
...wow, $40,000.

23:38.546 --> 23:42.607
Now, if you don't get us the money
by then, the house is ours.

23:42.650 --> 23:47.383
$40,000?!
Do you accept Mexican Express?

23:47.822 --> 23:49.949
There's no way we can come up
with all that money in three weeks.

23:49.991 --> 23:54.087
Look, gentlemen, I am really sorry
I couldn't help you out.

23:55.029 --> 23:59.159
You know what? Please, take one of these
free pens for your troubles, huh?

23:59.200 --> 24:01.498
Here you go.

24:01.536 --> 24:05.233
Oop! Not that one. They have to qualify
you for a loan for that.

24:07.041 --> 24:08.531
Just one each.

24:09.544 --> 24:13.036
Just one. Fine. OK.
{clears throat}

24:15.316 --> 24:16.613
Ahh.

24:22.056 --> 24:25.822
A pen. They take your house
and they give you a pen.

24:38.072 --> 24:40.973
OK, mis ninos, everyone to bed.

24:41.008 --> 24:44.808
Are you scared about
losing this house, Daddy?

24:44.846 --> 24:47.815
Well, yes. I am.

24:47.849 --> 24:50.545
But, you're not supposed to get scared.

24:50.585 --> 24:54.385
- Yeah. You're the dad.
- Right. Well...

24:55.690 --> 24:59.387
- Oh! You know who was always brave?
- Chihuahua Warriors!

24:59.427 --> 25:03.864
Yes! Now let me tell you a
story that will make you feel better.

25:03.898 --> 25:05.024
{girls} Yeah!

25:05.066 --> 25:10.504
Long ago, tribes would
all work together as one family

25:10.538 --> 25:14.702
and the young would be nurtured
and cared for by the entire tribe.

25:14.742 --> 25:17.210
But the whole village
would be watched over

25:17.245 --> 25:20.339
by the brave and mighty Chihuahua...

25:21.782 --> 25:24.250
...which is lucky, because on this day

25:24.285 --> 25:27.880
a vicious snake
was looking for an easy victim.

25:27.922 --> 25:28.946
{hissing}

25:28.990 --> 25:31.288
And the mighty Chihuahua
swung into action,

25:31.325 --> 25:34.920
grabbing the snake with its jaws
and wrestling it to the ground.

25:34.962 --> 25:36.429
- {screams}
- {growls, barks}

25:38.532 --> 25:41.023
{Papi} And even the mightiest
human warriors

25:41.068 --> 25:43.935
were impressed with
this brave little dog.

25:44.572 --> 25:47.598
He was the hero to the whole village,

25:47.642 --> 25:53.046
but most of all,
he was a hero to his own family.

25:53.080 --> 25:57.073
- {puppies} Wow!
- Wow. I'm afraid of snakes.

25:57.118 --> 26:01.020
- Me, too.
- Not the Chihuahua Warriors.

26:01.055 --> 26:03.421
They weren't afraid of anything.
Right, Dad?

26:03.457 --> 26:07.826
Of course they were afraid.
Everyone has fears.

26:07.862 --> 26:13.129
The difference is, a Chihuahua Warrior
has the courage to face their fears.

26:13.167 --> 26:17.365
- Even of snakes?
- {chuckles} Yes. Even of snakes.

26:17.405 --> 26:22.001
Buenas noches, my brave little
Chihuahua Warriors! Sweet dreams.

26:22.043 --> 26:24.341
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Dad.

26:32.286 --> 26:36.086
Hey! You guys see that? That
vine looks like a snake.

26:36.123 --> 26:37.852
That's a branch, silly.

26:38.726 --> 26:39.920
{hissing}

26:39.961 --> 26:42.953
No, look! It's a ferocious beast.

26:42.997 --> 26:44.726
- {Pep} Yeah, let's get it.
- {Lala} Yeah.

26:47.401 --> 26:49.926
So? Are they asleep this time?

26:49.971 --> 26:54.271
Go ahead, check. I assure you,
they are peacefully asleep.

26:54.308 --> 26:56.503
- {puppies barking}
- {nervous chuckle}

26:56.544 --> 26:58.944
On second thought, I'll be right back!

26:59.146 --> 27:00.773
Get it, Papi, Jr.!

27:00.815 --> 27:03.613
- Get over here now, you evil beast.
- {Ali} Get the snake!

27:04.318 --> 27:05.808
I got you right where I want you.

27:05.853 --> 27:07.821
- {girls} Yeah! You can do it!
- Kids! Kids!

27:07.855 --> 27:10.016
You need to tone it down
before your mom...

27:10.057 --> 27:12.890
Oh, let me guess,
you told them another story.

27:12.927 --> 27:16.294
Papi, Jr. is a brave
Chihuahua Warrior. See?

27:17.031 --> 27:19.226
What on earth are you doing?

27:19.266 --> 27:20.358
- {creaking}
- Whoa!

27:20.401 --> 27:22.232
- Get down from there!
- No!

27:22.770 --> 27:24.863
{screaming}

27:24.905 --> 27:27.499
- {dog growls}
- {crashing}

27:35.816 --> 27:37.681
{Chloe} Delgado!

27:37.718 --> 27:38.844
{girls whimpering}

27:38.886 --> 27:41.912
Oh, I've never been so happy
to see someone in my whole life!

27:42.423 --> 27:46.655
Hello, princesa. I believe
this little one belongs to you.

27:46.694 --> 27:50.596
Thank goodness you were here.
I'm forever in your debt, Delgado.

27:50.631 --> 27:55.625
Papi, Jr., you go back to bed this
instant and never do that again.

27:55.669 --> 27:58.137
I was just trying to be a brave
Chihuahua Warrior,

27:58.172 --> 28:01.039
- like in Dad's stories.
- {girls laughing}

28:01.075 --> 28:02.201
Papi!

28:02.243 --> 28:05.303
Well, I guess he didn't read
the fine print where I said,

28:05.346 --> 28:08.179
- ''Don't try this at home.''
- Thanks, Delgado.

28:08.215 --> 28:11.207
- And nice catch.
- {dogs barking}

28:13.921 --> 28:17.186
- What's going on out here?
- Sam?

28:18.059 --> 28:22.018
- Delgado?
- Papi, I see you still have your human.

28:22.063 --> 28:25.226
- I don't believe it.
- Don't get all mushy on me now.

28:25.266 --> 28:27.598
How did you get here
all the way from Mexico?

28:28.102 --> 28:30.696
I better call your partner, Detective
Ramirez, and find out what's up.

28:30.738 --> 28:34.799
- Delgado, how did you find us?
- The scent.

28:34.842 --> 28:38.744
Chloe's the only dog I know
who wears Chanel No. 5.

28:39.246 --> 28:41.737
Pedro, this is the amigo
I told you about,

28:41.782 --> 28:45.218
the one that kept mi corazon
safe when she was lost in Mexico.

28:45.252 --> 28:48.187
It's a true honor to meet you.

28:48.989 --> 28:51.219
Maybe don't flash that grill, bro.

28:51.258 --> 28:53.988
What are you doing
in Los Angeles, Delgado?

28:54.028 --> 28:57.395
I'm here on assignment. Police business.

28:57.431 --> 28:59.524
I know. It's a jewel heist, isn't it?

28:59.567 --> 29:02.127
Or counterfeiters.
Or kidnappers...

29:02.169 --> 29:04.603
I can see you
haven't changed a bit, kid.

29:04.638 --> 29:07.903
I bet you're tracking
a cat burglar, right?

29:07.942 --> 29:10.934
I can't tell you,
but I can use your help.

29:10.978 --> 29:14.175
Will you come with me
on a special assignment tomorrow?

29:14.215 --> 29:17.150
Delgado, I would do anything for you.

29:17.318 --> 29:18.979
Wow.

29:19.019 --> 29:20.987
All right, Detective Ramirez, will do.

29:22.423 --> 29:25.984
So you met this dog in Mexico, and now
he found you here in Los Angeles?

29:26.026 --> 29:27.926
{Sam} Yeah,
I don't know why he came here.

29:27.962 --> 29:30.453
But Detective Ramirez said that
they're wrapping up a big case

29:30.498 --> 29:33.399
down there and that, they won't be able
to pick him up for a few weeks.

29:33.434 --> 29:35.197
I said we'd look after him
until they come.

29:36.403 --> 29:40.271
- Come on, guys. Let's get back to bed.
- We're so glad you're here, my friend.

29:40.307 --> 29:42.172
{Delgado} Glad to be here, amigo.

29:42.576 --> 29:45.443
{Chloe} Come on, Delgado.
I'll show you where you can stay.

29:47.548 --> 29:48.606
You OK, bro?

29:48.649 --> 29:53.882
No, I think I messed up tonight, Pedro.
Papi, Jr. could have gotten very hurt.

29:53.921 --> 29:57.721
I just hope I can be the father that
Chloe wants me to be.

29:57.758 --> 30:02.991
Any mutt can have puppies,
but it takes a real dog to be a father.

30:03.497 --> 30:05.624
Just follow your heart.

30:08.435 --> 30:11.598
{Papi chuckles} My heart is what keeps
getting me in trouble.

30:14.875 --> 30:16.035
{sirens blaring}

30:16.076 --> 30:18.135
{Chloe} What are we doing
at the police station?

30:18.179 --> 30:21.012
What's so secret?
Am I some sort of lookout?

30:21.048 --> 30:23.516
- No. No.
- Do we need disguises?

30:23.551 --> 30:26.019
- Are we here to meet our contacts?
- No!

30:26.053 --> 30:29.420
Maybe...
Maybe we should have code names.

30:29.456 --> 30:33.017
Mine's gonna be ''White Fox.'' Yeah!

30:33.060 --> 30:36.860
And yours should be... Ohh, I know,
''Jellybean''!

30:36.897 --> 30:41.300
No. Chloe, I just need you
to be here, OK? Because...

30:41.335 --> 30:42.927
{dogs barking}

30:42.970 --> 30:44.733
This is a bad idea.
Maybe we should go.

30:44.772 --> 30:47.036
Look. Those two dogs
are coming this way.

30:48.442 --> 30:52.276
- What are you doing here?
- We're here on the big case with you.

30:52.313 --> 30:53.837
Delgado, I mean,

30:53.881 --> 30:56.406
- ''Jellybean'' and I are old partners.
- Chloe!

30:57.184 --> 31:00.745
I came all the way from Mexico.
I have something to tell you.

31:00.788 --> 31:03.689
- It's important.
- Look, we're kind of busy right now.

31:03.724 --> 31:06.955
- We're working on a bank robbery case.
- Bank robbery!

31:06.994 --> 31:10.395
You can totally count on White Fox
and Jellybean to have your back.

31:10.431 --> 31:15.061
Not if one of them happens to be your
father. He's never had our back.

31:15.102 --> 31:17.195
{whistles} Let's go.

31:17.238 --> 31:19.536
- We have to go now.
- Bye.

31:20.507 --> 31:26.446
- ''Father''? Is that a code word?
- No. Those are my sons.

31:26.480 --> 31:30.439
''Sons''? I had no idea you had sons.

31:30.484 --> 31:34.614
I thought with you by my side, I'd have
the strength to tell them the truth.

31:35.389 --> 31:37.619
Forget it. I can't change the past now.

31:37.658 --> 31:39.922
I'm sorry I dragged you
into this, Chloe.

31:42.763 --> 31:45.095
{mid-tempo music}

31:49.403 --> 31:54.397
Oh, Sam, there must be something
we can do. I'm gonna ask Aunt Viv.

31:54.441 --> 31:55.806
{Sam} No, no, no.

31:55.843 --> 31:58.539
My father's very proud.

31:58.579 --> 32:01.241
Borrowing money is something
he just can't do.

32:02.283 --> 32:04.251
- I'm gonna come home.
- No, it's OK.

32:04.285 --> 32:07.584
I think I found it. I think this is it!

32:07.621 --> 32:11.352
Rachel, you and Aunt Viv are doing
important research down there.

32:11.392 --> 32:13.257
We'll figure something out.

32:13.294 --> 32:16.627
I love you, Sam.
I'm here for you if you need me.

32:17.498 --> 32:18.829
You know, I should go.

32:18.866 --> 32:22.859
I'm not making very good company
right now. So... talk to you soon.

32:23.771 --> 32:25.966
OK. Bye.

32:27.308 --> 32:28.332
{phone beeps off}

32:34.014 --> 32:35.641
Was that Rachel on the phone?

32:37.184 --> 32:38.981
- Hmm?
- Yep.

32:39.987 --> 32:42.751
So, when am I gonna
start planning the wedding?

32:42.790 --> 32:44.951
I've already picked out my dress.

32:46.360 --> 32:47.884
Ma, come on.

32:48.962 --> 32:51.453
I love Rachel.
You know, I think she's great.

32:51.498 --> 32:55.696
- So?
- I'm just... I'm you know, I'm worried.

32:56.704 --> 32:58.501
{mother} What are you worried about?

33:00.708 --> 33:03.905
I'm worried I won't be able
to give her the life she deserves.

33:05.179 --> 33:06.703
Huh.

33:09.483 --> 33:11.644
You just don't get it, do you?

33:12.553 --> 33:16.182
You both love each other,
and that's what's important.

33:16.724 --> 33:18.988
The rest will work itself out.

33:27.334 --> 33:31.498
{sighs} Man, Papi.
What am I gonna do?

33:33.974 --> 33:35.737
I'm scared I won't be...

33:37.311 --> 33:39.336
- ...won't be enough.
- Won't be enough.

33:40.180 --> 33:43.445
I feel you, man. I feel you.

33:52.259 --> 33:53.726
{door knocker banging}

33:53.761 --> 33:56.093
- Were you expecting anyone?
- No.

33:56.130 --> 33:59.156
- Oh! I hope it's pizza.
- For breakfast?

33:59.199 --> 34:02.930
- {Papi} What? Any time is pizza time!
- {knocker continues}

34:04.872 --> 34:07.932
Hello? Hello?

34:09.676 --> 34:12.702
Good morning. Oh, I'm sorry.
Did we wake you up?

34:12.746 --> 34:14.007
You know what? Good for you.

34:14.047 --> 34:16.811
To be in this much debt and still
be able to sleep like a baby?

34:16.850 --> 34:20.377
That's a gift. I'm Mr. Kroop.
We met the other day at the bank.

34:20.420 --> 34:22.446
How could I forget? You gave me a pen.

34:22.489 --> 34:25.083
Yes, I did. And now,
I'm giving you a notice.

34:25.592 --> 34:29.083
I'm here to inspect the house
since the bank will be...

34:29.129 --> 34:31.154
...selling it once you're out.

34:31.197 --> 34:34.099
Let's move, people. Could we get
some coffee? That'd be great.

34:35.369 --> 34:36.699
{stammers}

34:38.304 --> 34:39.533
{dogs barking}

34:42.376 --> 34:44.708
{groans} More dogs.

34:44.745 --> 34:48.112
Lovely. Morning!

34:49.248 --> 34:53.049
- Samuel, what's going on?
- They can't just come in like this.

34:53.085 --> 34:55.520
There's nothing we can do.
They have the right.

34:55.556 --> 34:58.491
Come on, everyone. They're not
taking this house so easily.

34:58.525 --> 35:01.426
- {puppies} Yeah!
- Let's go.

35:09.670 --> 35:10.694
{barking}

35:13.040 --> 35:16.100
Hi, there! Can we all just get along?

35:16.143 --> 35:18.338
- {barks}
- {shouting}

35:18.378 --> 35:20.346
Adios.

35:21.849 --> 35:25.580
Ooh. Good thing that table
was there to break his fall.

35:27.721 --> 35:31.851
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Come on. That's not yours.

35:31.892 --> 35:34.417
Give it to me. Put it down.
Come on.

35:36.330 --> 35:38.355
- Let go.
- You let go.

35:38.398 --> 35:40.958
Bad lady. Very bad lady!

35:41.001 --> 35:45.370
- Give it to me!
- Be careful what you wish for.

35:47.207 --> 35:49.141
{shouting, grunting}

35:49.176 --> 35:50.700
- {crashing}
- {puppies laugh}

35:50.744 --> 35:51.870
Good one.

35:54.815 --> 35:58.842
OK. Now, I need you
to sign some documents.

35:58.886 --> 36:01.184
I need you to sign here, here and...

36:01.221 --> 36:02.620
{grunting}

36:02.656 --> 36:06.422
I probably wouldn't use...
These almost never work.

36:06.460 --> 36:08.189
So why don't we use mine.

36:08.228 --> 36:10.389
- {barks}
- {groans}

36:12.966 --> 36:16.402
{stammers} I'm not really a dog person.
I just...

36:16.436 --> 36:18.870
I... Could you just...

36:19.339 --> 36:22.240
Could you just step off the papers?
They're kind of important.

36:22.576 --> 36:24.703
Put the pen down.

36:33.053 --> 36:37.046
- You wouldn't dare.
- Just try me, cat man.

36:38.825 --> 36:41.020
- {urinating}
- Ohh...

36:42.996 --> 36:44.520
Whoo!

36:44.565 --> 36:48.194
- I feel better now.
- When you gotta go, you gotta go.

36:49.369 --> 36:51.894
- I'll take that. Thank you.
- Hey!

36:53.340 --> 36:54.398
Bad dog! Bad dog!

36:54.441 --> 36:57.877
Come back here!
Where you going? Drop it! Leave it!

36:57.911 --> 36:59.435
Bad dog!

36:59.479 --> 37:00.912
Whoa! {grunts}

37:00.948 --> 37:02.643
{gasping}

37:06.653 --> 37:08.245
Looking for this?

37:11.058 --> 37:13.652
{panting}

37:13.694 --> 37:15.719
This is a madhouse!

37:15.762 --> 37:18.322
I am officially evicting you
from this property.

37:18.365 --> 37:21.266
- What? We have three weeks!
- You can't do this to us.

37:21.301 --> 37:23.428
{laughs} Yes, I can.

37:23.470 --> 37:25.199
Your dogs have ruined this house,

37:25.238 --> 37:27.001
and this house is about
to belong to the bank.

37:27.975 --> 37:31.172
You know I could have the sheriff here?
Hmm? Would you like that?

37:31.211 --> 37:32.974
I want you out of here by tonight,

37:33.013 --> 37:35.481
before your little rats
can do any more damage.

37:40.554 --> 37:42.954
I'll take this back.
Thank you very much.

37:45.125 --> 37:48.822
What do we do now? Sleep in the streets?

37:52.866 --> 37:55.733
{Sam} Don't worry. You guys
are gonna be comfortable here.

37:56.403 --> 37:57.734
{puppies barking}

38:02.442 --> 38:04.672
- How many people live here?
- One.

38:06.146 --> 38:07.807
Must be a giant.

38:09.282 --> 38:12.080
Aunt Viv said you could stay
as long as you need.

38:23.597 --> 38:26.122
Oh. I'm too depressed to eat.

38:26.166 --> 38:27.360
{sighs}

38:32.839 --> 38:34.329
This is some place, huh, Ma?

38:35.742 --> 38:38.677
Even the doghouse
is bigger than our place.

38:40.981 --> 38:43.040
{sobs} Excuse me.

38:46.019 --> 38:47.748
I'm just trying to cheer her up.

38:48.422 --> 38:49.719
I know.

38:54.161 --> 38:56.095
I'll go talk to her.

39:04.304 --> 39:05.362
Hey.

39:06.473 --> 39:08.566
''Beverly Hills Dog Show''?

39:12.679 --> 39:16.547
$50,000 prize? That's it!

39:16.583 --> 39:18.608
We should enter the dog show.

39:18.652 --> 39:21.849
- Papi, look!
- My love, you're a genius.

39:21.888 --> 39:24.948
lf we win,
the money would save the house.

39:25.392 --> 39:27.121
{Appoline laughing}

39:28.095 --> 39:34.000
You think you could win the dog show?
lmpossible. It is always moi.

39:34.267 --> 39:39.830
Do not make me laugh. Chihuahua?
More like ''chi-ha-ha.''

39:39.873 --> 39:41.534
Oh, ho, ho.

39:41.575 --> 39:44.408
That's it. You're going down, Frenchy!

39:46.213 --> 39:49.114
We're gonna do this. Let's tell Sam.

39:49.149 --> 39:50.912
{both barking}

39:53.987 --> 39:55.716
What's gotten into you two?

39:58.759 --> 40:01.785
Hello! I wanna do the dog show.

40:02.829 --> 40:04.228
Look at you posing.

40:05.999 --> 40:07.296
Dog show.

40:08.902 --> 40:12.099
Wait a second. Oh, my gosh.

40:12.739 --> 40:17.039
You guys could be in the dog show.
That $50,000 prize could save the house.

40:19.012 --> 40:23.915
- Good idea, Chloe.
- Finally. Guys are so slow.

40:26.620 --> 40:28.212
{owl hooting}

40:32.125 --> 40:34.218
{Papi} Is he nervous
about the dog show?

40:34.261 --> 40:35.853
{Chloe} No, it's not that.

40:37.964 --> 40:40.023
Looks like he could use a friend.

40:41.902 --> 40:45.531
- You OK, amigo?
- Yeah. Sure.

40:45.572 --> 40:49.770
I know you're worried about your sons.
Please tell us what happened, Delgado.

40:49.810 --> 40:52.472
We're your friends. You can trust us.

40:53.513 --> 40:54.639
{sighs}

40:55.615 --> 40:58.709
About three years ago,
when I was on the force in Mexico,

40:58.752 --> 41:01.220
we apprehended some really bad guys.

41:02.088 --> 41:03.180
{gunshots}

41:06.393 --> 41:08.327
We also got their dogs.

41:08.361 --> 41:12.297
Those dogs said they'd get their
revenge by hurting my pups.

41:12.332 --> 41:13.890
{pups whimpering}

41:13.934 --> 41:15.868
{doorbell rings}

41:15.902 --> 41:19.167
So I took my boys out of the country
and brought 'em to Los Angeles.

41:19.873 --> 41:21.898
Thought they'd be safer away from me.

41:31.418 --> 41:33.386
It was the hardest thing I've ever done.

41:39.226 --> 41:42.821
Don't turn around. Don't turn around.

41:44.064 --> 41:47.056
I went into hiding
and I lost contact with my sons.

41:47.634 --> 41:51.434
And as time went by,
I knew I had to find them again.

41:51.471 --> 41:54.235
But now they think
I abandoned them for no reason.

41:54.274 --> 41:57.266
But if you tell them what happened,
they'll understand.

41:57.310 --> 41:59.175
Hmm...

41:59.212 --> 42:04.115
My sons won't listen to me. After
the dog show, I'm going back to Mexico.

42:06.820 --> 42:10.449
Poor Delgado.
We gotta do something to help him.

42:24.638 --> 42:25.798
{Papi sighs}

42:25.839 --> 42:28.774
- Dad?
- Oh, sorry to wake you, son.

42:28.808 --> 42:31.572
- Go back to sleep.
- We can't sleep.

42:31.611 --> 42:34.580
Yeah. We're too worried
about our family splitting up.

42:34.614 --> 42:38.414
- I know, ninos.
- {Lala} Tell us another story, Daddy.

42:38.451 --> 42:41.284
Yeah. Another one
about the Chihuahua Warriors.

42:41.321 --> 42:44.449
No, I really shouldn't.
Remember what happened last time?

42:44.491 --> 42:45.981
- Oh, Daddy.
- Come on, Daddy.

42:46.026 --> 42:50.258
- Yeah, Dad. Please?
- {chuckles} OK. All right.

42:50.297 --> 42:53.061
You see, the Chihuahua Warriors,

42:53.099 --> 42:55.363
they were not just brave
and passionate.

42:55.402 --> 43:00.169
They were also fiercely loyal to their
fellow Chihuahuas and to their humans.

43:00.640 --> 43:04.838
- They were?
- Oh, yes. ln ancient times,

43:04.878 --> 43:07.870
they used to follow
their humans into battle.

43:09.115 --> 43:13.245
Fighting for their kingdom
was often very fierce.

43:13.286 --> 43:16.380
But they knew that
even in times of great danger,

43:16.423 --> 43:20.519
they must stand by their friends and
warn them of their attacking enemies.

43:20.560 --> 43:21.754
{shouts}

43:21.795 --> 43:24.958
Even at the risk of their own lives.

43:24.998 --> 43:28.331
{battle music}

43:28.368 --> 43:30.393
- {shouts}
- {all shouting}

43:37.877 --> 43:40.437
That Chihuahua saved the king's life?

43:40.480 --> 43:45.474
Yes. Stick by your loved ones,
even in hard times.

43:45.518 --> 43:48.851
We are stronger together
than we are alone.

43:48.888 --> 43:52.449
From now on, we'll be the most
loyal Chihuahuas ever,

43:52.492 --> 43:54.892
and we'll never let our family split up.

43:54.928 --> 43:57.954
{chuckling} I know you won't.
Sleep tight.

43:57.998 --> 43:59.397
{Papi, Jr.} Good night, Dad.

43:59.432 --> 44:02.333
- {Ali, Lala} Good night, Daddy.
- {Rosa} Good night, Papa.

44:11.511 --> 44:13.308
...was the best in breed.

44:13.346 --> 44:16.645
Think like a winner, be a winner!
Think like a winner, be a winner!

44:16.683 --> 44:19.880
- Top of the morning to you.
- Likewise.

44:19.919 --> 44:21.386
{barking}

44:23.223 --> 44:26.386
- Yes, thank you.
- Oh, yes. Sure. Very nice.

44:32.332 --> 44:36.530
That is one big check. Sam,
you're gonna need a bigger wallet.

44:41.541 --> 44:43.839
Pretty. Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

44:43.877 --> 44:45.572
How ya doing, buddy?

44:48.214 --> 44:50.705
Is it me, or is it hard to tell
the dogs from their owners?

44:50.750 --> 44:53.116
Hey, man, don't flatter yourself.

44:53.153 --> 44:55.212
{indistinct chatter}

44:57.557 --> 44:58.854
May I help you?

44:58.892 --> 45:01.087
I hope so.
We're here to enter the dog show.

45:01.127 --> 45:02.890
Oh.

45:05.465 --> 45:09.925
- Buenos dias.
- With these dogs?

45:11.805 --> 45:16.742
This is a very prestigious dog show.
Dogs train for years to be prepared.

45:16.776 --> 45:21.304
I am not sure you or
your dogs have what it takes.

45:21.948 --> 45:24.917
Well, I think we
just might surprise you.

45:24.951 --> 45:26.942
I doubt it.

45:26.986 --> 45:29.614
But in the meantime,
you could fill out these forms.

45:35.028 --> 45:36.120
- Oh, hello!
- Hi.

45:36.162 --> 45:37.254
Good to see you.

45:37.297 --> 45:39.288
- Let me get your paperwork.
- Yes, thank you.

45:39.666 --> 45:42.032
Beautiful, darling, beautiful.
Look this way.

45:43.603 --> 45:46.163
Little higher. There you go.
Thank you. Appoline, right here.

45:46.206 --> 45:48.970
{groans} Do I smell garbage?

45:49.008 --> 45:52.500
Oh, oh, no.
It is just the peasant dogs.

45:52.545 --> 45:54.479
{all laughing}

45:54.514 --> 45:56.675
Oh, we're the ones that smell, huh?

45:56.716 --> 45:59.651
Well, there's a reason ''poodle''
starts with the word ''poo''!

46:01.121 --> 46:02.486
Good one.

46:04.858 --> 46:06.086
{groans}

46:07.393 --> 46:10.851
{man on TV} And now, live from
Beverly Hills, California...

46:10.897 --> 46:12.194
Yay! It's starting!

46:12.232 --> 46:13.995
{all cheering}

46:14.367 --> 46:18.463
Oh! They just have to win!
I've got all my paws crossed.

46:18.505 --> 46:21.440
This is more nerve racking
than a trip to the vet!

46:21.474 --> 46:23.965
Oh, will you Chatty Cathys shush!

46:24.010 --> 46:28.174
And the 25th Annual Beverly Hills
Dog Show is now underway.

46:28.214 --> 46:31.706
And, Polly, we have got dogs
from all over the world

46:31.751 --> 46:36.450
competing in three different categories:
Beauty, style, talent.

46:36.489 --> 46:40.892
Gonna see who the top dog is,
winning that $50,000 grand prize.

46:40.927 --> 46:43.293
- I got goose bumps.
- Oh, look!

46:43.329 --> 46:47.493
Here comes our panel of judges,
led by the esteemed Judge McKible.

46:52.539 --> 46:54.734
All right, people,
two minutes to show time.

46:54.774 --> 46:57.004
- You guys ready to do this?
- I'm in.

46:57.043 --> 46:58.840
{pop music plays}

46:59.946 --> 47:01.470
{speaks Spanish}

47:01.514 --> 47:03.209
{all speak Spanish}

47:04.150 --> 47:07.642
And we are off with the first round:
Beauty.

47:07.687 --> 47:11.179
Yeah, let's see those Beverly Hills dogs
strut their stuff, huh? Yowza.

47:20.066 --> 47:21.465
Fantastic!

47:47.660 --> 47:49.855
- Now that's cute.
- Yeah, look at that.

47:57.470 --> 47:58.494
{whines}

48:04.777 --> 48:06.244
I wouldn't put money on that one.

48:12.619 --> 48:13.643
{groans}

48:13.686 --> 48:15.347
- Oh, my.
- {Rosa} Oh, no!

48:15.388 --> 48:17.117
Delgado's been eliminated.

48:17.156 --> 48:19.818
Uncle Delgado looks so sad.

48:20.426 --> 48:22.860
And he's gonna lose his sons, too.

48:23.997 --> 48:27.023
It is time for the second round: Style.

48:27.066 --> 48:30.331
And only ten contestants
remain in the competition.

48:30.370 --> 48:32.895
{pop music plays}

48:32.939 --> 48:33.963
Fashion.

48:37.677 --> 48:38.837
I'm gonna get stung.

48:58.498 --> 49:02.696
I'm just so happy to be here.
I just can't help but...

49:02.735 --> 49:05.067
Wait! Don't do a Pedro! Don't...

49:05.104 --> 49:06.401
{music ends abruptly}

49:06.839 --> 49:08.830
- {all gasping}
- {groans}

49:08.875 --> 49:10.502
...smile.

49:13.012 --> 49:14.309
Disqualified!

49:14.347 --> 49:16.144
{pop music plays}

49:21.587 --> 49:23.248
Look at that.

49:25.258 --> 49:28.591
Yikes! Looks like a cupcake exploded.

49:29.729 --> 49:31.060
Bravissimo!

49:37.837 --> 49:38.997
There's my ride.

49:44.577 --> 49:46.010
{man wolf whistles}

49:46.045 --> 49:47.672
Ay, Chihuahua!

49:55.288 --> 49:57.222
Now, I like this one.
This one I really do like.

49:57.256 --> 49:59.656
- It's like a little angel. Right?
- Yes, exactly.

49:59.692 --> 50:02.160
- {Spanish music plays}
- {Polly} Whoa!

50:02.195 --> 50:05.653
Chihuahua Aztec Warrior!
Fantastic!

50:15.808 --> 50:19.335

- Oh, he's bursting with pizzazz!

50:19.379 --> 50:21.313
- Go, Dad!
- {girls cheer}

50:21.347 --> 50:24.043
- He really is a Chihuahua Warrior!
- Whoo-hoo!

50:24.717 --> 50:27.686
Well, we are on to Round Three: Talent!

50:27.720 --> 50:33.625
And with only five dogs left, this
competition is really heating up! Yowza!

50:33.659 --> 50:35.126
{techno music plays}

50:38.331 --> 50:40.458
Oh! Faboo!

50:43.202 --> 50:46.137
- Oh!
- Ooh! That one was faboo, too.

50:46.172 --> 50:48.640
- Faboo. I'm gonna start saying that.
- Oh.

50:56.516 --> 50:57.983
Faboo!

51:02.488 --> 51:04.046
No, no.

51:05.525 --> 51:09.552
Snooty. Snooty puss. Got a snooty puss.

51:11.931 --> 51:13.762
- {clears throat}
- {song ends}

51:13.800 --> 51:15.859
{classical music}

51:28.114 --> 51:30.344
- Wow. She's good.
- That is amazing.

51:33.886 --> 51:35.114
And voila!

51:40.927 --> 51:42.588
- {music ends}
- {audience gasps}

51:42.628 --> 51:44.095
Look at that. Oh, marvelous.

51:44.130 --> 51:47.031
- Clever! Clever!
- {Polly} My gosh. That's so impressive.

51:47.066 --> 51:51.366
- {man} That's clever.
- It's an homage. It is an homage!

51:52.038 --> 51:55.235
Wow. That Appoline
is a regular Pet-casso.

51:57.243 --> 51:58.938
- You get that?
- I got it.

51:58.978 --> 52:01.105
- Yes, yes. Very clever.
- Pet-casso.

52:01.147 --> 52:04.639
{orchestra tuning instruments}

52:04.684 --> 52:07.710
{flashbulbs}

52:11.757 --> 52:14.021
{plays classical piece}

52:17.663 --> 52:19.858
- Oh. Mmm.
- Hmm. Ahh.

52:38.117 --> 52:40.017
- {hits wrong note}
- Oops!

52:43.890 --> 52:47.758
No! No, no, no! Dismissed!

52:48.127 --> 52:51.153
What? Oh, you have gotta be kidding!

52:51.197 --> 52:55.065
- {Polly} Not fair.
- It's a dog! Playing a piano.

52:56.202 --> 52:58.602
lf you can't play it right,
you shouldn't play it at all.

52:58.638 --> 52:59.662
{audience boos}

52:59.705 --> 53:03.937
Playing the piano with paws.
Not even fingers.

53:03.976 --> 53:07.912
- Boo! Not faboo.
- Sorry.

53:12.318 --> 53:13.910
What is going on?

53:13.953 --> 53:16.945
How dare you!
My Chloe is the most beautiful,

53:16.989 --> 53:20.618
the most stylish and the most
talented dog in the entire world!

53:20.660 --> 53:23.925
She has a coat
like the whitest of snow,

53:23.963 --> 53:27.865
and eyes that sparkle like diamonds,
and a heart as big as...

53:27.900 --> 53:31.233
Well, as big as...
Why don't I just show you?

53:31.270 --> 53:32.794
{Spanish music}

53:32.838 --> 53:34.703
Papi, what are you doing?

54:12.378 --> 54:13.709
{Papi speaks Spanish}

54:14.880 --> 54:18.111
She has a heart as big as this one.

54:18.150 --> 54:20.482
{audience cheers, applauds}

54:26.192 --> 54:30.356
My Chloe will live in my heart forever.

54:30.396 --> 54:32.990
Now that's talent.

54:33.499 --> 54:35.694
- {groans}
- Humph!

54:35.735 --> 54:36.793
{man whistles}

54:36.836 --> 54:41.739
{crowd} Papi! Papi! Papi!
Papi! Papi! Papi!

54:41.774 --> 54:43.867
Papi! Papi! Papi!

54:43.909 --> 54:48.209
I'll tell you, Appoline has
some serious competition this year,

54:48.247 --> 54:52.843
- and his name is Papi!
- Papi. I love you, Papi!

54:52.885 --> 54:56.116
Oh, Papi, te adoro.

54:57.757 --> 54:59.384
{crowd} Awww!

54:59.425 --> 55:03.418
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have chosen this year's finalists,

55:03.462 --> 55:06.056
and they are... Papi Cortez...

55:07.333 --> 55:08.595
Yes!

55:11.671 --> 55:15.471
- ...and Appoline Bouvier.
- Yes!

55:19.178 --> 55:22.011
{clears throat} Judge McKible.

55:27.119 --> 55:29.314
What's this?

55:29.355 --> 55:33.883
I don't know, but Judge McKible
looks very concerned.

55:35.661 --> 55:38.687
Mr. Cortez, you do realize

55:38.731 --> 55:42.360
the Beverly Hills Dog Show
is for purebreds only.

55:42.401 --> 55:46.997
Do you have Papi's birth papers
showing his pedigree?

55:47.039 --> 55:49.940
No, we rescued him from the street.
He was a stray.

55:49.975 --> 55:51.442
I knew it.

55:56.048 --> 56:01.008
He might not have
breeding papers or a pedigree,

56:01.454 --> 56:05.447
but you'll never meet a dog that shows
more pure Chihuahua heart...

56:07.760 --> 56:09.022
...than Papi.

56:09.061 --> 56:14.795
Fight the tears. I'm not gonna cry.
I'm not gonna do it. Not gonna cry.

56:14.834 --> 56:16.324
{audience applauds}

56:18.471 --> 56:20.962
- Bravo.
- {woman} So important.

56:21.006 --> 56:22.098
{man} Hear, hear.

56:22.141 --> 56:24.405
- {woman 2} Well said.
- I'm sorry, rules are rules.

56:26.612 --> 56:27.909
Ladies and gentlemen,

56:27.947 --> 56:31.576
Papi Cortez has been disqualified
for lack of breeding papers.

56:31.617 --> 56:33.585
{all groaning}

56:33.619 --> 56:35.519
- I'm so upset.
- Oh, no.

56:36.689 --> 56:39.624
The winner of the 25th annual
Beverly Hills Dog Show

56:39.658 --> 56:44.960
- for the fourth year in a row is...
- Mademoiselle Marie Appoline Bouvier!

56:47.500 --> 56:50.867
These dogs aren't the only thing fixed
about this competition.

56:52.104 --> 56:54.334
We won! {squeals, laughs}

56:57.910 --> 56:59.571
Thank you.

57:01.480 --> 57:03.107
We won.

57:07.520 --> 57:10.284
Au revoir. {laughs}

57:14.393 --> 57:15.553
{Sam} Let's go, guys.

57:15.594 --> 57:17.027
{emcee} That's it for
the Beverly Hills Dog Show.

57:17.062 --> 57:19.622
This is loco. I can't even watch.

57:19.665 --> 57:21.860
- Oh, no.
- It's not fair.

57:21.901 --> 57:23.129
Hmm...

57:23.169 --> 57:25.364
I know something we can do.

57:27.206 --> 57:29.333
{birds calling}

57:29.375 --> 57:30.842
{satellite phone rings}

57:34.113 --> 57:35.341
- Hello?
- {Sam} Rach?

57:35.381 --> 57:36.973
Sam, how'd it go?

57:37.016 --> 57:39.678
- Not so good.
- {Rachel} Oh, no.

57:39.718 --> 57:43.449
{Sam} Yeah, now we have two days
to pack up the house and move on.

57:43.489 --> 57:46.014
- Oh, Sam.
- I'm going to Arizona

57:46.058 --> 57:48.618
for a little while to get them set up.

57:48.661 --> 57:52.290
I already contacted Viv's housekeeper
about watching the dogs.

57:52.798 --> 57:57.064
- I can come too, if you want.
- Nah, that's OK.

57:58.103 --> 58:03.006
- This is a family thing.
- I... thought we were family.

58:04.276 --> 58:07.109
You know, that we would get married
and have kids someday.

58:07.746 --> 58:10.909
Rach, I can't take care
of you and a family

58:10.950 --> 58:13.418
when I can hardly take care
of the one I already have.

58:14.553 --> 58:16.145
Oh, I see.

58:18.624 --> 58:21.115
I should go, they need me here.

58:24.129 --> 58:26.757
- Goodbye, Sam.
- Bye, Rach.

58:30.803 --> 58:33.431
{Papi} Oh, Sam, love is like
chasing your tail,

58:33.472 --> 58:35.531
spinning and spinning...

58:35.574 --> 58:37.838
And trust me,
it hurts when you catch it.

58:37.877 --> 58:42.280
Papi, come quick! The puppies are gone!
I can't find them anywhere!

58:42.314 --> 58:44.077
- What? Gone?
- Oh, no.

58:44.116 --> 58:46.607
- What are you talking about?
- Maybe they're hiding somewhere.

58:46.652 --> 58:49.985
- {Papi} Ninos! Hey, this isn't funny.
- {Chloe} Kids! Where are you?

58:50.022 --> 58:52.513
The scent's old.
They're not in the house.

58:52.558 --> 58:56.460
lf anything happens to them,
I don't know what I'll do.

58:56.495 --> 58:59.328
Don't worry, mi amor,
I will not let that happen.

58:59.365 --> 59:02.027
Oh! Where could they be?

59:04.803 --> 59:09.399
This is scary. We've never been
out by ourselves before.

59:10.075 --> 59:12.407
Don't you want to be
real Chihuahua Warriors,

59:12.444 --> 59:15.106
- like the ones in Dad's stories?
- {girls} Yeah.

59:15.147 --> 59:17.513
Then we have to help Uncle Delgado.

59:17.549 --> 59:21.110
'Cause families stick together
and Delgado is family.

59:21.153 --> 59:24.179
Now, this is where Delgado
said his sons work.

59:24.223 --> 59:26.657
We'll just tell them the truth
and they'll forgive him.

59:26.692 --> 59:28.319
{man on radio} Attention, all units.
Attention all units.

59:28.360 --> 59:31.852
We have a robbery in progress
at Southcoast Bank. All units respond.

59:31.897 --> 59:34.764
We got a situation, everybody.
Round up the dogs and move out!

59:34.800 --> 59:36.995
- Quick time, double time, let's go!
- {officer} Come on.

59:37.036 --> 59:39.732
{Papi, Jr.} Hey, those dogs look
just like Uncle Delgado.

59:39.772 --> 59:41.899
That must be them. Let's go!

59:43.208 --> 59:44.698
{officer 2} Let's get 'em in.

59:46.679 --> 59:48.078
Close 'er up!

59:48.113 --> 59:49.137
Go! Go! Go!

59:49.181 --> 59:51.445
{man on radio} K-9 unit,
what's your status?

59:51.483 --> 59:54.350
Yes, this is the K-9 unit,
is mobile and on the move.

59:54.386 --> 59:57.787
Hey, what are you doing in here?
This is police property.

59:57.823 --> 01:00:00.849
We're friends with your dad, and we've
got something to tell you.

01:00:02.027 --> 01:00:04.154
{indistinct shouting}

01:00:04.997 --> 01:00:06.521
{siren blares}

01:00:06.865 --> 01:00:08.765
{all} Whoa!

01:00:16.709 --> 01:00:18.438
Move it, move it! Move, move, move!

01:00:18.477 --> 01:00:21.810
- {officer 1} Copy that. Go, go!
- {officer 2} Keep going!

01:00:21.847 --> 01:00:25.146
- {officer 3} Second unit, in. Go!
- Come on. Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.951
{officer 4} Let's go. Right there!

01:00:29.989 --> 01:00:31.752
{indistinct shouting}

01:00:33.759 --> 01:00:36.193
Come on, boys!
Come on, boys! Catch the scent!

01:00:36.695 --> 01:00:38.356
We'll talk more about this after.

01:00:38.397 --> 01:00:40.695
Stay here,
we don't want you getting hurt.

01:00:42.001 --> 01:00:44.469
Come on, boys. Let's go.

01:00:45.437 --> 01:00:50.397
Oh, no. We didn't tell them Uncle
Delgado's leaving LA soon. Come on!

01:00:59.251 --> 01:01:01.981
{Sam} Uh-huh. Yes, five puppies. Yeah.

01:01:03.322 --> 01:01:05.517
Well, if you see them,
please give us a call.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.190
- Any news?
- I feel terrible.

01:01:10.229 --> 01:01:12.527
I put those stories in their heads.

01:01:12.564 --> 01:01:13.997
When will I ever learn?

01:01:14.033 --> 01:01:17.366
{man on TV}...where a bank robbery
is in progress.

01:01:17.436 --> 01:01:21.338
Hey, isn't that our bank?

01:01:22.241 --> 01:01:24.903
- Turn it up.
- It is our bank.

01:01:25.778 --> 01:01:28.747
Police have informed us that
the robbers are still inside.

01:01:28.781 --> 01:01:31.079
At this time, there are no hostages.

01:01:31.116 --> 01:01:34.347
- Did I just see what I think I saw?
- Yes! It's them!

01:01:34.386 --> 01:01:37.878
We will keep you updated on this
breaking story as events unfold.

01:01:37.923 --> 01:01:41.620
- Guacamole's going on here?
- I'm going to the bank.

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:44.356
Mom, Dad, you guys stay here in case
anyone calls and gets them first.

01:01:44.396 --> 01:01:46.956
- Of course.
- Please hurry, Sam.

01:01:46.999 --> 01:01:50.366
- They're my puppies. I'm going too.
- Not without me.

01:01:50.402 --> 01:01:52.666
Delgado, Pedro, let's roll.

01:01:55.707 --> 01:01:58.403
I don't see Delgado's sons.
Where'd they go?

01:01:58.911 --> 01:02:01.607
I bet they went that way.
Follow me.

01:02:01.647 --> 01:02:04.878
Oh, no. What if we never find them?

01:02:04.917 --> 01:02:09.149
Oh, I mean, of course we'll find them.
We're Warriors.

01:02:10.656 --> 01:02:13.454
Antonio! Alberto! Where are you?

01:02:13.592 --> 01:02:16.288
- {puppies shout}
- This is scary.

01:02:16.328 --> 01:02:18.421
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

01:02:18.464 --> 01:02:22.423
Oh, presents! Oh, boy, is it Christmas?

01:02:23.435 --> 01:02:26.461
Hey, look. This is what everyone's been
saying we need.

01:02:26.505 --> 01:02:28.996
We can save the house with this.

01:02:30.175 --> 01:02:32.507
Everyone, get as much of it as you can.

01:02:32.544 --> 01:02:33.704
{Ali} Yeah! Come on, guys.

01:02:33.745 --> 01:02:36.441
- {Lala} I'm next. I'm next. Me me, me.
- {Pep} Wow. Look at all this.

01:02:39.351 --> 01:02:40.750
{man} Come on, the coast is clear.

01:02:42.855 --> 01:02:46.086
Come on, come on. Come on.

01:02:46.925 --> 01:02:49.018
{Papi, Jr.} Hey, what's going on here?

01:02:49.528 --> 01:02:52.190
- {Pep} Who turned out the lights?
- Hurry up.

01:02:52.231 --> 01:02:54.665
- {Ali} What's going on?
- {Lala} Get us out of here.

01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:57.567
- {Papi, Jr.} What's the big idea?
- {Ali} What's happening?

01:02:57.603 --> 01:02:59.628
- {Papi, Jr.} It's dark in here.
- Go!

01:02:59.671 --> 01:03:03.004
{engine revs}

01:03:03.041 --> 01:03:04.565
{tires squeal}

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.011
{officer} What?

01:03:10.582 --> 01:03:13.676
Gone? Are you sure?

01:03:14.686 --> 01:03:16.347
Please, stand back here.

01:03:16.388 --> 01:03:19.255
I'm sorry, folks. You're just gonna
have to stay back.

01:03:23.729 --> 01:03:25.321
- You guys, wait here.
- No way,

01:03:25.364 --> 01:03:28.197
those are my kids you're talking about.
Come on, let's go.

01:03:32.604 --> 01:03:34.731
{Kroop} Yeah, I can't say
anything right now, ma'am.

01:03:34.773 --> 01:03:36.764
- Sorry about that, but I can't.
- {woman} What exactly happened?

01:03:36.808 --> 01:03:38.742
There were at least 1 5 or 20 of them.

01:03:38.777 --> 01:03:42.213
They were ninja fast,
and they all were very, very large,

01:03:42.247 --> 01:03:44.579
but I fought four
or five of them off myself.

01:03:44.616 --> 01:03:47.585
Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is a crime scene,
sir. I need you to step back.

01:03:47.619 --> 01:03:50.918
Right, sorry. Did you happen to see five
Chihuahua puppies around here?

01:03:50.956 --> 01:03:52.116
Puppies?

01:03:54.593 --> 01:03:56.493
I got their scent. Come on.

01:04:06.205 --> 01:04:09.299
They were just here.
Search for clues.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.339
Hey. Look at this.

01:04:19.985 --> 01:04:21.509
Look what I found.

01:04:21.954 --> 01:04:23.888
Great, a clue!

01:04:23.922 --> 01:04:27.050
A ski mask? You think it has
something to do with the kids?

01:04:27.092 --> 01:04:29.617
- Yeah?
- I know who can help us. Come on.

01:04:39.972 --> 01:04:45.000
You can do this, Delgado. Go talk
to them. I'll be right behind you.

01:04:50.148 --> 01:04:52.309
Dad? What are you doing here?

01:04:53.418 --> 01:04:55.545
Look, I know you don't
want to see me right now,

01:04:55.587 --> 01:04:56.986
but I got some missing puppies.

01:04:57.022 --> 01:05:01.618
And I think this may be a clue
as to where they went. Any ideas?

01:05:03.195 --> 01:05:07.393
Smells like flour. Eggs. Butter.

01:05:08.033 --> 01:05:11.662
- Bread. It's bread.
- Any bakeries around here?

01:05:11.703 --> 01:05:16.163
Oh, of course. The Hoffman
Bread factory! It's right near here.

01:05:16.208 --> 01:05:18.574
Good job, kid. Let's go get your pups.

01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:20.635
We'll grab the humans
and meet you there.

01:05:20.679 --> 01:05:21.941
Thanks, boys.

01:05:24.249 --> 01:05:26.342
Come on, everyone. Vamonos.

01:05:31.823 --> 01:05:33.450
Oh, no.

01:05:33.492 --> 01:05:36.393
Oh, where are they going?
Where are they going?

01:05:43.068 --> 01:05:45.536
- Whoa!
- {Papi imitates siren}

01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:47.834
Police business, look out!
Coming through.

01:05:50.575 --> 01:05:52.372
{horns honking}

01:05:52.944 --> 01:05:55.208
{Papi} Watch out, dog crossing!
Whoo-whoo!

01:06:03.755 --> 01:06:05.848
- {buzzer sounds}
- {machines starting up}

01:06:20.906 --> 01:06:23.374
Hey, better hurry up
before the foreman shows up.

01:06:24.209 --> 01:06:25.301
Yeah, like he'd ever notice.

01:06:25.344 --> 01:06:27.835
How many of these jobs we pulled off
in the last few months?

01:06:27.879 --> 01:06:31.007
Yeah, we just hit the on button
and the machines do all the work.

01:06:31.049 --> 01:06:32.914
It's a perfect cover.

01:06:36.021 --> 01:06:38.581
{sniffs} This smells like the place.

01:06:38.623 --> 01:06:39.885
- {all sniffing}
- Ooh!

01:06:39.925 --> 01:06:42.257
- Pumpernickel.
- Let's go.

01:06:42.294 --> 01:06:46.856
Those guys in there can be real meanies.
You got some kind of a plan?

01:06:46.898 --> 01:06:48.593
{Papi} Don't I always, hermano?

01:06:52.037 --> 01:06:53.800
- {Ali} Help!
- {pep} Somebody help us!

01:06:53.839 --> 01:06:55.704
- {Lala} Let us out!
- {thieves laughing}

01:06:58.110 --> 01:07:00.408
- Let's see how much we got.
- {barking}

01:07:00.445 --> 01:07:02.345
- Whoa.
- {growls}

01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:07.784
- Who brought the dog?
- I didn't bring the dog.

01:07:07.819 --> 01:07:11.516
Back off, mister. You can't kidnap us
and get away with it.

01:07:12.824 --> 01:07:14.883
- {all exclaiming}
- Sounds like a rubber duck.

01:07:14.926 --> 01:07:17.417
- That guy is tough.
- Bring it on, ese.

01:07:17.462 --> 01:07:21.023
- I'm a Chihuahua Warrior.
- What are you gonna do, bite my toe?

01:07:21.066 --> 01:07:22.829
Wow, look how tough he thinks he is.

01:07:29.241 --> 01:07:31.402
Wow. I'm really good.

01:07:31.443 --> 01:07:33.411
- {Pedro snarling}
- {all murmuring}

01:07:33.445 --> 01:07:36.710
- Nice doggy.
- Back away from the puppies!

01:07:36.748 --> 01:07:41.378
And in case you're wondering,
this isn't a smile.

01:07:43.955 --> 01:07:45.445
Easy. Nice doggy.

01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:48.186
- Who you callin' ''nice''?
- I'm outta here.

01:07:49.327 --> 01:07:53.525
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!
Split up! Split up!

01:07:54.266 --> 01:07:56.564
Uncle Pedro. You found us!

01:07:56.601 --> 01:08:01.664
I mean, not that I needed your help
or anything. But they're getting away!

01:08:01.706 --> 01:08:04.106
Don't worry. They won't get far.

01:08:05.811 --> 01:08:09.645
{barking}

01:08:09.681 --> 01:08:11.842
- There's the signal.
- Ready?

01:08:11.883 --> 01:08:12.941
Ready.

01:08:14.453 --> 01:08:16.785
{Ali} Help! I wanna go home!

01:08:23.862 --> 01:08:25.955
Ah! {grunts}

01:08:28.033 --> 01:08:30.694
- Gee, that was kinda fun.
- Oh, whoa.

01:08:31.569 --> 01:08:32.594
Whew!

01:08:32.636 --> 01:08:35.071
Oh! Thank goodness you're OK.

01:08:35.106 --> 01:08:36.937
- Mom?
- Delgado!

01:08:36.975 --> 01:08:40.774
Looks like we still make
a pretty good team, Jellybean.

01:08:40.812 --> 01:08:44.714
- I mean, Delgado.
- Yeah, we still got it, kid.

01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:47.946
But let's not make a habit
of this rescuing thing.

01:08:47.986 --> 01:08:50.352
{panting} We lost 'em.

01:08:50.388 --> 01:08:52.151
{puppies whining}

01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:53.657
{Papi} lncoming!

01:08:54.526 --> 01:08:58.622
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.
No one messes with my kids.

01:08:58.662 --> 01:09:01.393
Left, right. Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right.

01:09:01.433 --> 01:09:03.731
Left, right. Left, right.
Left, right.

01:09:04.836 --> 01:09:07.805
- What's going on?
- Left, right. Left, right. Left, right!

01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:09.898
You think that's gonna stop us?

01:09:11.276 --> 01:09:12.903
No, but this will.

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:16.872
{buzzer sounds}

01:09:16.915 --> 01:09:19.109
- {machine starts}
- {gasps}

01:09:20.051 --> 01:09:22.076
{both gasp, shout}

01:09:22.888 --> 01:09:25.185
{muffled voices}

01:09:26.358 --> 01:09:29.054
Now you guys are really
rollin' in the dough.

01:09:29.094 --> 01:09:30.322
Whoop! {laughs}

01:09:30.362 --> 01:09:31.920
{both grunting}

01:09:34.566 --> 01:09:37.057
- Daddy, that was awesome!
- Wow, Dad, that was amazing!

01:09:37.102 --> 01:09:39.229
- That was awesome.
- We showed them, huh?

01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:41.102
Your mother and I were worried sick.

01:09:41.139 --> 01:09:44.836
What you kids did, leavin' home
without tellin' us, was off-leash.

01:09:44.876 --> 01:09:46.399
Way off-leash!

01:09:46.444 --> 01:09:48.377
- Sorry, Dad.
- We're sorry, Dad.

01:09:48.412 --> 01:09:51.439
- Sorry, Dad.
- Sorry isn't good enough.

01:09:51.483 --> 01:09:54.111
You kids are grounded for the...

01:09:54.152 --> 01:09:56.450
- ...rest of your lives!
- {puppies gasp}

01:09:56.488 --> 01:09:57.955
- {Ali} What?
- No way!

01:09:57.989 --> 01:10:03.791
Papi, their intentions were in the
right place and, if it wasn't for them,

01:10:03.828 --> 01:10:06.763
- the bank robbers would've gotten away.
- True.

01:10:06.798 --> 01:10:09.892
So, what, two weeks?

01:10:09.935 --> 01:10:13.632
Don't you think they've shown
that they are good Chihuahua Warriors?

01:10:13.672 --> 01:10:16.641
OK, you're grounded for one week.

01:10:16.675 --> 01:10:19.644
And no bacon-wrapped filet mignon.

01:10:19.678 --> 01:10:20.702
{puppies groaning}

01:10:20.745 --> 01:10:22.144
- No.
- Come on, Dad.

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:25.547
OK, OK, you can have 'em.
But act like you don't like 'em.

01:10:25.584 --> 01:10:27.313
- OK, Dad.
- Promise.

01:10:27.352 --> 01:10:30.219
Papi, I'm so proud of you.

01:10:30.255 --> 01:10:34.214
You're really becoming the father
I always knew you could be.

01:10:34.259 --> 01:10:36.193
Thank you, mi corazon.

01:10:36.861 --> 01:10:38.852
- {sirens}
- {indistinct radio chatter}

01:10:40.465 --> 01:10:42.660
- OK, our bus is ready.
- You got the wrong guy.

01:10:42.701 --> 01:10:45.761
- Yeah, yeah. We're bread makers.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

01:10:45.804 --> 01:10:49.433
- I hope you got a good lawyer.
- I hate dogs.

01:10:56.014 --> 01:10:59.677
Don't turn around. Don't turn around.

01:10:59.718 --> 01:11:02.687
Come on, Delgado. Turn around.

01:11:03.455 --> 01:11:04.945
{dog} Dad, wait.

01:11:06.257 --> 01:11:08.020
I think we owe you an apology.

01:11:08.927 --> 01:11:11.691
Chloe and the puppies
told us why you left.

01:11:11.730 --> 01:11:15.860
We didn't know that you did it
to protect us. Thank you, Dad.

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:20.428
I'm just glad I got a chance to see you
boys again. Make things right.

01:11:21.139 --> 01:11:22.197
{sighs}

01:11:22.874 --> 01:11:24.501
Come on, guys.

01:11:26.378 --> 01:11:28.209
Quite the police dog, fella.

01:11:29.214 --> 01:11:31.444
Let's see who you belong to.

01:11:32.050 --> 01:11:34.610
''Mexican Police Force'', huh?

01:11:34.653 --> 01:11:37.281
I wonder if they'd let us
borrow you for a little while.

01:11:37.322 --> 01:11:41.986
We sure could use your nose on a couple
of cases. What do you boys think?

01:11:43.361 --> 01:11:46.694
OK, OK. Let me give 'em a call.

01:11:46.731 --> 01:11:48.323
You want me to stay?

01:11:48.366 --> 01:11:50.664
Yeah, I think we have
a lot of catching up to do.

01:11:50.702 --> 01:11:52.693
- {officer} Come on, guys.
- It's great to have you back, Dad.

01:11:53.705 --> 01:11:57.300
It looks like you're gonna be
a Beverly Hills dog, Delgado.

01:11:57.342 --> 01:12:01.608
Thanks for everything, princesa.
You have a beautiful family.

01:12:01.646 --> 01:12:05.173
And thanks to them,
I have my family back, too.

01:12:05.216 --> 01:12:06.808
I'm sure I'll see you around.

01:12:06.851 --> 01:12:11.015
And I can't wait for next year's
dog show. What do you say, Delgado?

01:12:11.056 --> 01:12:15.254
{laughs} ln your dreams, kid. Adios.

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:16.950
Load up.

01:12:19.898 --> 01:12:21.297
And you, too.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.733
{Sam} There you guys are.

01:12:39.818 --> 01:12:42.343
I know. I missed you, too.

01:13:07.312 --> 01:13:09.246
{whines}

01:13:18.556 --> 01:13:19.853
{Kroop clears throat}

01:13:21.493 --> 01:13:24.189
Don't worry, we're leaving.
You didn't have to bring the police.

01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:26.663
We're not going
to cause you guys any trouble.

01:13:26.698 --> 01:13:28.598
Can you give us one second
of your time, please?

01:13:28.633 --> 01:13:33.127
Hey! You know, your dogs
are pretty special.

01:13:33.171 --> 01:13:36.334
They solved the case
that stumped an entire task force.

01:13:36.908 --> 01:13:39.604
We been trackin' these criminals
for three months.

01:13:39.644 --> 01:13:42.807
They got over 1 5 million dollars
from banks in the area.

01:13:44.282 --> 01:13:45.840
{mutters}

01:13:45.884 --> 01:13:50.321
And there is a $250,000 reward
for their capture.

01:13:52.757 --> 01:13:56.818
Which is yours. It'll probably pay off
the loan on your house and then some.

01:13:56.861 --> 01:14:00.388
- Hey, guys! Come quick! Check this out.
- {Pedro} What's going on?

01:14:00.431 --> 01:14:02.592
Is this a joke?
'Cause I'm not laughing.

01:14:02.634 --> 01:14:05.296
I can assure you, Mr. Cortez,
this is not a joke.

01:14:05.336 --> 01:14:08.328
ln fact, you can come down to the bank
this week and sign the papers.

01:14:08.373 --> 01:14:13.777
And... here's your pen back.
Sorry about that.

01:14:13.812 --> 01:14:18.442
You know what, those never work.
Take this one. OK.

01:14:19.517 --> 01:14:23.248
Holy guacamole! We did it!
We saved the house!

01:14:25.657 --> 01:14:29.991
Gracias. Oh, my goodness.

01:14:30.028 --> 01:14:32.360
{speaks Spanish}

01:14:33.932 --> 01:14:35.900
No, I'm fine. Really, that's...

01:14:35.934 --> 01:14:39.199
You don't really have...
OK, we're hugging it out.

01:14:39.237 --> 01:14:44.334
I'm having a hard time breathing.
That's great. Please let go.

01:14:44.375 --> 01:14:47.640
- Yes.
- What are we waiting for? Let's unpack.

01:14:47.679 --> 01:14:49.613
- Unpack.
- I'm gonna stay out here.

01:14:49.647 --> 01:14:50.841
Ah.

01:14:57.755 --> 01:15:00.417
Come on, guys!
Let's show him some love!

01:15:00.458 --> 01:15:02.551
- {puppies cheering}
- Oh, no-no-no. No, no, no.

01:15:02.594 --> 01:15:04.027
No-no-no. Good dogs!

01:15:04.062 --> 01:15:06.155
- Good dogs...
- Dogpile!

01:15:06.197 --> 01:15:09.098
{groaning} Bad dogs. Bad dogs.

01:15:09.133 --> 01:15:11.397
I'm really not a dog person.

01:15:11.436 --> 01:15:13.836
Oh... {laughing}

01:15:13.872 --> 01:15:15.669
My kitty's going to be very jealous.

01:15:32.957 --> 01:15:34.481
{doorbell rings}

01:15:39.898 --> 01:15:42.128
- Come in, Rachel.
- Hi.

01:15:46.004 --> 01:15:49.963
I called her. A mother
wants to see her son happy.

01:15:54.812 --> 01:15:57.076
{both whisper in Spanish}

01:16:02.887 --> 01:16:06.379
- I'm so sorry, Rachel.
- {Rachel} No, I'm sorry.

01:16:06.424 --> 01:16:08.688
I hated the way we left things.

01:16:08.726 --> 01:16:12.594
I wanna be with you,
whether we're married or not.

01:16:13.731 --> 01:16:17.132
And I want to be with you... forever.

01:16:18.403 --> 01:16:20.837
I wanna have a family with you.

01:16:21.506 --> 01:16:24.737
I wanna depend on each other
for the rest of our lives.

01:16:28.246 --> 01:16:29.577
Go for it, Sam.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:39.253
Rachel, will you marry me?

01:16:45.697 --> 01:16:49.497
Yes. Yes, of course!

01:16:50.468 --> 01:16:52.766
{all dogs barking}

01:17:05.883 --> 01:17:08.283
And I'm throwing the wedding!

01:17:08.586 --> 01:17:09.985
{Sam} Viv!

01:17:10.021 --> 01:17:12.615
Oh, congratulations.

01:17:12.924 --> 01:17:14.118
{whines}

01:17:15.159 --> 01:17:16.649
Let's celebrate!

01:17:16.694 --> 01:17:18.685
{pop music plays}

01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:35.968
OK, kids, ready to play?
Marco!

01:17:36.014 --> 01:17:37.276
{puppies} Polo!

01:17:37.315 --> 01:17:39.715
- Marco!
- {puppies} Polo!

01:17:39.751 --> 01:17:41.878
- Marco!
- Polo!

01:17:41.919 --> 01:17:43.045
You can't catch me.

01:17:57.468 --> 01:17:59.800
Come on, let's join in the fun.

01:17:59.837 --> 01:18:02.829
Mi corazon, be careful, the mud.
Wait here.

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:12.111
Oh, Papi, you're so romantic.

01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:16.177
But of course.
After all, I am a Chihuahua.

01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:18.245
Don't I know it.

01:18:21.859 --> 01:18:23.349
Ahh...

01:18:23.394 --> 01:18:24.827
Papi likes.

01:19:49.017 --> 01:19:52.509
Every pet deserves a loving
and permanent home.

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:54.215
So if you're adopting a pet,

01:19:54.256 --> 01:19:57.191
please be sure you are ready
for a lifetime commitment,

01:19:57.226 --> 01:20:00.024
and please adopt responsibly.

01:20:00.062 --> 01:20:02.690
Gracias and thank you.
