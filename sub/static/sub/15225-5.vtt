01:20.868 --> 01:23.267
My name is Spencer.
I'm an investigator.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.534
I'm looking
for a Jim Ignatowski.

01:25.567 --> 01:26.834
Ohh...

01:29.734 --> 01:32.000
I guess that's Ignatowski.

01:32.033 --> 01:34.067
Yeah, well, uh,
it could be. Uh...

01:34.100 --> 01:35.968
do you have business
with Mr. Ignatowski?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.033
Well, like I said,
I'm a private investigator.

01:38.067 --> 01:39.367
I was hired to find him.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.367
Oh.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.133
Is the fuzz still here?

01:43.167 --> 01:45.467
Only on your brain.

01:46.567 --> 01:47.767
He ain't the fuzz, Jim.

01:47.801 --> 01:49.000
He's a private dick.

01:49.033 --> 01:50.567
Oh, Mr. Ignatowski.

01:50.601 --> 01:53.567
You sure have been
a hard man to find.

01:53.601 --> 01:55.667
Well, I've been
in the bathroom.

01:55.701 --> 01:57.467
You know, it's
pretty difficult

01:57.501 --> 01:58.634
tracking down a man

01:58.667 --> 02:01.801
whose last known address
was a '63 Volkswagen.

02:01.834 --> 02:04.234
And then, what
really threw me off

02:04.267 --> 02:05.734
was the name change.

02:05.767 --> 02:09.100
You used to be
Jim Caldwell, right?

02:09.133 --> 02:11.901
Jim, you changed your name
 <i>to</i> Ignatowski?

02:11.934 --> 02:14.434
Yeah. You know...

02:14.467 --> 02:16.167
it was the '60s

02:16.200 --> 02:19.167
and everybody
was changing their names

02:19.200 --> 02:22.133
to stuff like
Sunshine, Free...

02:22.167 --> 02:25.267
Moon Unit.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.834
Well, Jim, why Ignatowski?

02:27.868 --> 02:29.167
Huh!

02:29.200 --> 02:30.567
Say it backwards.

02:30.601 --> 02:32.734
Ikswotangi.

02:32.767 --> 02:34.067
Uh-oh.

02:34.100 --> 02:37.234
That's not even close
to "Star Child," is it?

02:38.601 --> 02:40.434
Well, look, my job
here is to deliver this

02:40.467 --> 02:41.767
to Mr. Ignatowski.

02:41.801 --> 02:42.934
Here you are.

02:42.968 --> 02:44.067
Thanks.

02:44.100 --> 02:45.467
See you around.
Okay.

02:45.501 --> 02:46.501
What is it?

02:46.534 --> 02:47.534
What's...
what is it?

02:50.934 --> 02:52.734
What is it, Jim?
Wow.

02:52.767 --> 02:54.200
What is it?

02:54.234 --> 02:57.100
It's written in some
strange language

02:57.133 --> 02:58.601
unknown on this planet.

02:58.634 --> 03:00.601
Jim, Jim...

03:00.634 --> 03:01.868
Who's it from?

03:01.901 --> 03:04.234
Where... where
do I find that?

03:04.267 --> 03:05.400
There.

03:05.434 --> 03:08.133
It's from my father.

03:08.167 --> 03:09.501
It's been a lot...

03:09.534 --> 03:11.767
lot of years,
lots of years...

03:11.801 --> 03:13.934
years and years...

03:13.968 --> 03:14.934
ALEX:
Jim, Jim?

03:14.968 --> 03:16.267
Pardon my intrusion.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.801
That's okay.
I didn't even hear it.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.367
No, no. Jim, Jim...

03:22.400 --> 03:24.968
what does... what does
your father want?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.801
Now, where do I
find that?

03:26.834 --> 03:29.234
Huh? Here. Give me this.
Let me see that.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.801
Hey, look at this.
He sent him

03:32.834 --> 03:35.834
two plane tickets...

03:35.868 --> 03:37.367
to Boston.
First class.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.000
Hey...
Wait a minute.

03:39.033 --> 03:40.567
( <i>chuckles</i> )

03:40.601 --> 03:42.367
A limousine will
pick you up there.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.067
Says he's getting
along in years.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.133
He was making

03:45.167 --> 03:46.567
out his will and he decided

03:46.601 --> 03:48.601
that he wanted to see
his family again.

03:48.634 --> 03:50.434
Wow.

03:50.467 --> 03:52.200
Is your father wealthy, Jim?

03:52.234 --> 03:53.601
Oh, yeah, yeah.

03:53.634 --> 03:54.934
He-he's rich.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.968
We lived on a big ranch.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.968
My dad taught me
how to be a man.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.100
Huh?

04:02.133 --> 04:03.200
Me and my
two brothers--

04:03.234 --> 04:05.100
little Joe and Hoss.

04:07.901 --> 04:09.834
Jim, that's <i>Bonanza.</i>

04:09.868 --> 04:12.968
Oh, yeah.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.367
But my father's wealthy.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.200
A very wealthy man.

04:18.233 --> 04:21.166
In fact,
he's probably a millionaire.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.801
This is incredible.

04:22.834 --> 04:25.067
My God, you know,
you are the last person

04:25.100 --> 04:26.934
that I'd expect from this garage

04:26.968 --> 04:28.834
to have come
from the upper crust.

04:28.868 --> 04:30.901
Hey, Jim, how come
you're not rich, too?

04:30.934 --> 04:34.834
Well, uh, Dad and I had
a parting of the ways.

04:34.868 --> 04:36.968
He threw me out of the house.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.200
I see.

04:38.234 --> 04:40.133
So, uh, you think
you'll go home?

04:40.167 --> 04:42.234
I don't know.

04:42.267 --> 04:44.534
Be interesting to see him.

04:44.567 --> 04:46.968
You know, it's a terrible thing

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
to forget the kind of people
you come from.

04:50.033 --> 04:51.133
Yep.

04:51.167 --> 04:52.834
JIM:
You know,
once a month

04:52.868 --> 04:54.234
like clockwork,

04:54.267 --> 04:56.868
I call him on the phone
and hang up

04:56.901 --> 04:59.300
just so I can hear
his voice say

04:59.334 --> 05:01.734
"For the last time,
who is this?"

05:04.467 --> 05:07.467
I'm going to the airport
right now...

05:07.501 --> 05:09.434
All right...
...and catch me
an airplane.

05:09.467 --> 05:10.434
Aw, great, Jim.

05:10.467 --> 05:11.434
That's
a good idea.

05:11.467 --> 05:12.501
It's the right choice.

05:12.534 --> 05:13.834
( <i>all talking at once</i> )

05:13.868 --> 05:14.834
Okay...

05:14.868 --> 05:16.434
Anybody want
to go with me?

05:16.467 --> 05:18.567
Huh? Huh? What do you mean?

05:18.601 --> 05:20.734
Dad sent me two tickets.

05:20.767 --> 05:24.067
Must have thought
I was married or had a friend.

05:24.100 --> 05:25.567
One of you could come along.

05:25.601 --> 05:26.801
No, no, no.
( <i>all talk at once</i> )

05:26.834 --> 05:28.234
I can't make it.

05:28.267 --> 05:32.901
Okay. Now, now, now
let's not fight
over this.

05:32.934 --> 05:35.767
There's only one fair
way to settle it.

05:35.801 --> 05:38.868
I'll think of a number
between one and ten.

05:38.901 --> 05:39.868
Hmm?

05:39.901 --> 05:41.033
Yeah.
ELAINE:
Okay.

05:41.067 --> 05:42.734
Sounds all right.
All right, Jim.

05:42.767 --> 05:44.400
All right.

05:49.267 --> 05:52.100
Uh... ah...

05:52.133 --> 05:53.300
I got it.

05:53.334 --> 05:54.234
What is it?

05:54.267 --> 05:55.133
Three.

05:55.167 --> 05:56.167
I'll take ten.

05:56.200 --> 05:56.934
Tony?

05:56.968 --> 05:57.834
Ten?

05:57.868 --> 05:59.601
Uh, ten for me, too, Jim.

05:59.634 --> 06:01.801
You're not gonna believe it--
but I always take ten.

06:01.834 --> 06:03.767
Boy, what are the odds
of that happening?

06:05.601 --> 06:07.067
ALEX:
All right...

06:07.100 --> 06:10.868
Well... let's try it again,
and I'll take six.

06:10.901 --> 06:12.467
See if that works.

06:14.467 --> 06:16.601
What's your
number, Alex?

06:20.167 --> 06:21.367
( <i>chuckles</i> )

06:21.400 --> 06:23.667
Well, I guess
my number is six.

06:23.701 --> 06:25.767
Now we're getting someplace.

06:25.801 --> 06:27.033
( <i>mutters</i> )

06:27.067 --> 06:28.267
What's your number, Elaine?

06:28.300 --> 06:30.367
No, no, no, no. Jim.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.367
No, Jim, no...

06:31.400 --> 06:32.434
Huh?
I-I want to go.

06:32.467 --> 06:34.968
Your father sent two tickets,
one for a friend.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.300
I'm the friend.

06:36.334 --> 06:37.467
Oh, gee.

06:37.501 --> 06:40.868
Dad's a pretty
smart guy, huh?

06:40.901 --> 06:44.033
What are you guys doing here?
Go home.

06:44.067 --> 06:45.367
JIM:
Hey, boss...

06:47.100 --> 06:50.133
I'm not going to be driving
for a couple of days.

06:50.167 --> 06:52.601
I'm going home to
Boston to see my dad.

06:54.200 --> 06:57.434
Ignatowski's got a father?

06:57.467 --> 07:00.634
There goes my spore theory.

07:03.734 --> 07:05.300
Jim, come on.
Let's get out of here.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.634
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

07:20.734 --> 07:22.534
Dad.

07:24.801 --> 07:26.334
I think he's a butler.

07:26.367 --> 07:29.300
I don't care what he
does for a living.

07:31.033 --> 07:32.067
He's my father.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.067
No, Jim.

07:33.100 --> 07:35.267
He's your
father's butler.

07:35.300 --> 07:36.834
Huh?

07:36.868 --> 07:38.501
Hi. Um, I'm
Alex Rieger.

07:38.534 --> 07:40.334
This is Mr.
Caldwell's son.

07:40.367 --> 07:41.834
I'll tell your father

07:41.868 --> 07:43.434
you're here.

07:43.467 --> 07:44.634
May I take your luggage?

07:44.667 --> 07:45.834
Oh, thank you.

07:49.834 --> 07:51.100
Well...

07:52.734 --> 07:54.434
Dad.

07:58.234 --> 08:01.100
You look even younger
than you used to.

08:01.133 --> 08:02.868
I'm your brother, Tom, Jim.

08:02.901 --> 08:04.033
Oh.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.934
Of course, Tom-Jim.

08:05.968 --> 08:08.834
This is my
brother, Tom-Jim.

08:09.834 --> 08:10.834
Tom. And you're..?

08:10.868 --> 08:12.767
Uh, extremely
uncomfortable.

08:12.801 --> 08:14.434
I'm-I'm Alex
Rieger. Hi.

08:14.467 --> 08:18.234
Tom Caldwell,
the son that lived.

Jim?

08:21.334 --> 08:22.868
Lila?

08:22.901 --> 08:24.267
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy!

08:24.300 --> 08:25.801
It's my sister, Lila.

08:25.834 --> 08:27.601

Lila, I'd like you to meet
my brother, Tom-Jim.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.801
LILA:
Hi.
And my friend, Alex Rieger.

08:32.833 --> 08:33.801
Oh, hi.

08:33.833 --> 08:35.634
Oh...

08:37.900 --> 08:39.333
Want a bite?

08:39.366 --> 08:40.601
Pardon me?

08:40.634 --> 08:42.100
Oh, no, thank you.

08:42.133 --> 08:43.900
Thank you very much.
( <i>chuckles</i> )

08:45.667 --> 08:48.834
Lila is a tad shy at first,
but she'll warm up to you.

08:56.634 --> 08:57.734
Nice family, Jim.

08:57.767 --> 08:59.834
Uh... thanks.

08:59.868 --> 09:01.934
Promise me you won't leave me
alone with them.

Wow.

09:08.300 --> 09:12.701
Boy, it's all coming
back to me, Alex...

09:12.734 --> 09:14.200
in bits

09:14.234 --> 09:15.567
and pieces.

09:15.601 --> 09:17.901
Hey, Jim, is that
your mother?

09:17.934 --> 09:19.367
Yeah.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.701
( <i>chuckles</i> )

09:20.734 --> 09:23.033
I don't remember her much.

09:23.067 --> 09:24.868
She passed away
when I was a kid.

09:24.901 --> 09:27.701
But she never took off
those white gloves.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.667
After she died,

09:35.701 --> 09:37.667
I was raised by a nanny.

09:37.701 --> 09:39.767
Oh, really?
Yeah.

09:39.801 --> 09:42.901
A fat, sweet-tempered
black lady.

09:42.934 --> 09:46.000
She used to laugh
at me all the time

09:46.033 --> 09:47.868
and scold me.

09:47.901 --> 09:49.267
For some reason,

09:49.300 --> 09:52.467
she used to call me
Miss Scarlett.

09:56.834 --> 09:59.367
 Jim, that's
 <i>Gone With the Wind.</i>

09:59.400 --> 10:01.734
Yeah...

10:01.767 --> 10:04.868
no use looking back
on it now.

10:09.934 --> 10:14.167
MAN:
Is my son in there?

10:14.200 --> 10:17.033
This could be
my dad...

10:17.067 --> 10:19.133
or your dad.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.133
Son.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.701
No.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.367
it's good to see you.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.033
You're bald.

10:48.834 --> 10:50.467
Yes, I am.

10:50.501 --> 10:54.400
You haven't got hardly a hair
on your head.

10:54.434 --> 10:56.067
( <i>laughing</i> )

10:56.100 --> 10:57.734
No, I haven't.

11:01.367 --> 11:05.200
James, it's been
a very long time.

11:05.234 --> 11:06.868
Yes, it has, Dad.

11:06.901 --> 11:09.300
Where did all your hair go?

Uh, Mr. Caldwell,
I'm Alex Rieger. Hi.

Don't go.

11:21.100 --> 11:22.434
Uh...

11:22.467 --> 11:23.868
please, stay, uh...

11:23.901 --> 11:26.334
Why don't you both sit down?

11:26.367 --> 11:28.100
Thank you.

11:32.601 --> 11:34.267
( <i>sighing</i> )

11:41.267 --> 11:44.968
Well, James, we have
a lot to talk about.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.667
A lot's happened,

11:46.701 --> 11:48.367
and I want to know everything--

11:48.400 --> 11:50.901
where you've been,
what you've done.

11:50.934 --> 11:54.300
I want to put all
the unpleasantness behind us.

11:54.334 --> 11:56.067
Thought about a toup?

11:56.100 --> 11:58.501
( <i>mutters</i> ):
Jim...

11:58.534 --> 12:00.167
You know, some people think

12:00.200 --> 12:02.968
that baldness makes a man look
distinguished.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.234
Thank you, Mr. Rieger.

12:05.267 --> 12:07.868
Well, what about
the fat part?

12:14.367 --> 12:17.667
I'm the same size
as when you left here.

12:17.701 --> 12:20.534
Oh, yes!
Now I remember.

12:20.567 --> 12:22.567
Everybody here was fat.

12:24.200 --> 12:29.801
James, don't we have
other things to talk about?

12:31.734 --> 12:33.267
It's good to see you, Dad.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.367
I missed you.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.334
All you had to do was call.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.367
Dad, I did.

12:41.400 --> 12:45.567
Once a month, no matter where
I was, for the last ten years,

12:45.601 --> 12:48.601
I called
just to hear your voice.

12:50.567 --> 12:54.868
Is that the number you've
had for the whole time?

12:54.901 --> 12:58.567
My God, I-I've
been estranged
from the wrong family.

13:05.033 --> 13:08.334
I don't know how
to talk to him.

13:10.033 --> 13:12.801
Is he, uh...?

13:12.834 --> 13:14.367
( <i>speaking gibberish</i> )

13:17.534 --> 13:19.501
Um...

13:19.534 --> 13:21.000
Mr. Ignatowski...
Uh...

13:21.033 --> 13:22.501
No, no. I mean,
Mr. Caldwell, I...

13:22.534 --> 13:23.767
I can assure you

13:23.801 --> 13:26.267
that in the year and a
half that I've known Jim,

13:26.300 --> 13:29.467
he's grown incredibly.

13:29.501 --> 13:32.834
Oh, my God.

13:32.868 --> 13:35.901
Uh, I'll have Carl show you
to your rooms.

13:35.934 --> 13:36.901
Oh, thank you.

13:36.934 --> 13:39.934
You have the same room, James.

13:39.968 --> 13:42.667
Even your toys
are still there...

13:42.701 --> 13:46.701
with the exception
of the airplane glue.

13:49.067 --> 13:52.033
You finished all of that.

13:52.067 --> 13:55.167
By the way,
we usually dress for dinner.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.501
Well, I certainly...

13:56.534 --> 13:57.968
Fine, fine.
Fine, thank you.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.834
Alex, I love him.

14:09.868 --> 14:11.200
It's amazing.

14:11.234 --> 14:14.334
I haven't seen
him for so long.

14:14.367 --> 14:16.167
He's changed physically.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.234
And we never were very close.

14:18.267 --> 14:21.267
And I've been talking
to a different voice.

14:21.300 --> 14:23.501
But there's something
about being here

14:23.534 --> 14:25.000
that has stirred me.

14:25.033 --> 14:26.501
It's in the genes.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.501
It's in those
chubby little genes.

14:30.534 --> 14:32.734
Yeah, well, that's-that's
fine, Jim, that's fine.

14:32.767 --> 14:34.934
I mean, I mean, that's why
you came here, right?

14:34.968 --> 14:35.934
( <i>sighs</i> )

14:35.968 --> 14:38.467
I don't love
my brother, Alex.

14:38.501 --> 14:39.601
That's all right, Jim.

14:39.634 --> 14:40.767
I don't know why.

14:40.801 --> 14:44.400
He's almost as fat as my dad.

14:44.434 --> 14:46.767
My sister...
I love a little.

14:46.801 --> 14:47.767
( <i>chuckles</i> )

14:47.801 --> 14:49.534
And I like the butler,

14:49.567 --> 14:51.334
and you've been terrific.

14:51.367 --> 14:52.834
Okay.

14:52.868 --> 14:54.634
Can we go home now?

14:54.667 --> 14:56.968
No, no, no, Jim.
Not yet. Not yet.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.734
You mean, there's more?

14:58.767 --> 15:00.901
Mm-hmm.

15:18.534 --> 15:22.033
What else
are we having tonight, Carl?

15:22.067 --> 15:24.834
Everything
but string beans, sir.

15:27.300 --> 15:30.200
Uh, Mr. Rieger,
if you like string beans...

15:30.234 --> 15:31.934
we can...
No, no, sir.
Thank you very much.

15:31.968 --> 15:33.601
I... have enough to
pick from right here.

15:33.634 --> 15:36.968
You just reach out
and grab anything you like.

15:39.934 --> 15:43.100
Lila, don't be cheap
in front of the company.

15:43.133 --> 15:46.634
Sorry, Daddy.

15:46.667 --> 15:49.200
Well, Jim, we have
a lot to talk about.

15:49.234 --> 15:51.434
I guess so.

15:51.467 --> 15:55.133
You like potatoes au gratin
or cottage fries?

15:55.167 --> 15:58.367
Uh... I don't
like potatoes.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.300
Still the rebel
without a cause, huh?

16:01.334 --> 16:05.234
James, why don't you tell us
about your life

16:05.267 --> 16:07.901
since you dropped
out of Harvard?

16:07.934 --> 16:09.901
Jim, you went
to Harvard?

16:09.934 --> 16:11.300
Uh... yep.

16:11.334 --> 16:13.234
He was there for a year.

16:13.267 --> 16:15.801
Got excellent grades
one semester.

16:15.834 --> 16:17.133
The next semester,

16:17.167 --> 16:20.801
he wrote all his term papers
in finger paint.

16:23.767 --> 16:26.834
A typewriter seemed
so impersonal.

16:26.868 --> 16:29.267
James, I would
seriously like to know

16:29.300 --> 16:32.501
what the past ten years
of your life

16:32.534 --> 16:33.534
have
consisted of.
Uh...

16:33.567 --> 16:35.400
Huh? No, I've only
known you for the last

16:35.434 --> 16:36.968
year and a half.
Would that be...?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.567
No. No.

16:38.601 --> 16:41.234
W-What have you been doing
with yourself?

16:41.267 --> 16:42.801
Drifting?

16:42.834 --> 16:44.267
Living on handouts?

16:44.300 --> 16:46.067
Getting stoned?

16:46.100 --> 16:48.234
Well, don't make it
sound so terrible.

16:48.267 --> 16:49.634
How do you make that sound good?

16:49.667 --> 16:52.567
Well, drifting...
( <i>chuckling</i> )

16:52.601 --> 16:55.801
You know, living on handouts.

16:55.834 --> 16:58.434
And getting <i>stoned.</i>

17:07.901 --> 17:09.334
It's disgusting.

17:09.367 --> 17:12.434
To throw away
the opportunities you had--

17:12.467 --> 17:13.834
the education,

17:13.867 --> 17:16.099
the... breeding.

17:16.133 --> 17:19.434
You know, and you... you don't
really feel ashamed, do you?

17:19.467 --> 17:20.666
No.

17:20.701 --> 17:23.166
Do you feel... remorse?

17:23.200 --> 17:24.934
No.

17:24.968 --> 17:25.934
What do you feel?

17:25.968 --> 17:28.300
Full.

17:28.334 --> 17:29.734
Uh-huh.

17:29.767 --> 17:32.734
I'd hoped the years
had changed you, James,

17:32.767 --> 17:36.834
but fact of the matter is
you don't give a damn, do you?

17:36.868 --> 17:38.067
You never have,

17:38.100 --> 17:40.167
and I don't think
you ever will.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.667
Well, sir,

17:41.701 --> 17:45.200
your presence in this house
is no longer appreciated.

17:57.634 --> 17:59.767
Well, Jim, uh...
excuse me.

17:59.801 --> 18:02.200
I-I think I'd better have
a word with your father.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.434
( <i>shudders</i> )

18:19.734 --> 18:22.100
Look, Mr. Caldwell,
I-I don't want to interfere

18:22.133 --> 18:24.133
in your family's affairs,
but I feel...

18:24.167 --> 18:25.367
Mr. Rieger...

18:25.400 --> 18:27.067
you may not believe this,

18:27.100 --> 18:29.334
but James
was always my favorite.

18:29.367 --> 18:31.334
I can believe that.

18:31.367 --> 18:34.601
I'd give anything if
even one of my children

18:34.634 --> 18:39.634
had turned out to be someone
I could respect.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.734
James was always special.

18:41.767 --> 18:44.033
You should have seen him
as a child.

18:44.067 --> 18:45.834
I do.

18:45.868 --> 18:49.701
Mr. Caldwell, the only damage
that Jim's ever done to anybody

18:49.734 --> 18:51.267
has been to himself.

18:51.300 --> 18:53.701
He's done his share of <i>that.</i>

18:55.300 --> 18:57.801
My problem is that the tax laws

18:57.834 --> 19:01.534
force me to give out
the bulk of my money now.

19:01.567 --> 19:06.100
Would you give a million dollars
to your Mr. Ignatowski?

19:06.133 --> 19:07.701
Look, Mr. Caldwell,

19:07.734 --> 19:11.300
I don't think that money
is an issue here for Jim.

19:11.334 --> 19:13.000
I mean, I think he
came here because he

19:13.033 --> 19:15.033
had a real desire to be
with his family again.

19:15.067 --> 19:16.968
I don't think the money
is important to him.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.634
You really believe that?

19:18.667 --> 19:19.901
Yes, I do.

19:19.934 --> 19:21.200
Mm-hmm.

19:22.534 --> 19:24.334
James, get in here.

19:24.367 --> 19:27.300
We'll soon see which
one of us is right.

19:27.334 --> 19:30.300
Hello again.

19:30.334 --> 19:35.100
James, I'm giving away
most of my money.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.100
I haven't decided
what the distribution

19:37.133 --> 19:38.801
is going to be
among my children,

19:38.834 --> 19:41.634
but I have come
to one decision.

19:41.667 --> 19:43.400
You're not getting
anything.

19:43.434 --> 19:46.501
Okeydoke.

19:48.267 --> 19:50.634
I don't believe it.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.334
Jim, your father thinks
you came here

19:53.367 --> 19:54.701
to get his money.

19:56.133 --> 19:58.000
Dad thinks that?

19:58.033 --> 20:00.000
( <i>mutters</i> )

20:00.033 --> 20:03.267
Boy, now I'm burned!

20:03.300 --> 20:06.300
It may take a lot to get me mad,
but this did it.

20:06.334 --> 20:07.534
Don't stop me, Alex!

20:09.200 --> 20:11.701
I'm going to say
what's on my mind.

20:13.267 --> 20:16.133
What was that last thing
you said?

20:16.167 --> 20:19.701
Your father thinks
you came here
to get his money.

20:19.734 --> 20:21.367
Dad thinks that?!
Oh!

20:21.400 --> 20:23.033
Hopeless.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.567
Now, you look here.

20:26.601 --> 20:29.234
The reason I came here
was to see you--

20:29.267 --> 20:31.968
to see my dad,
to see my family--

20:32.000 --> 20:34.534
and show you all that
I'm back on my feet again.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.734
And show you that I'm okay,

20:35.767 --> 20:38.200
and you don't have to worry
about me anymore.

20:40.334 --> 20:42.033
Dad...

20:43.334 --> 20:47.000
I came here because I wanted
to find out who I am,

20:47.033 --> 20:49.100
who you are,
who we all are.

20:49.133 --> 20:50.367
I mean, I wonder

20:50.400 --> 20:52.434
about these things, Dad.

20:52.467 --> 20:54.868
Like, I wonder about

20:54.901 --> 20:57.000
if you call
an orange an orange

20:57.033 --> 20:59.634
why don't you call
a banana a yellow?

21:00.534 --> 21:01.634
Or an apple a red?

21:01.667 --> 21:03.400
Well, you see,
the point is, Mr. Caldwell...

21:03.434 --> 21:04.868
Now, blueberries
make sense,

21:04.901 --> 21:07.601
but somebody explain
gooseberries to me.

21:09.767 --> 21:12.367
James...

21:12.400 --> 21:15.868
you really don't care
about my money?

21:15.901 --> 21:17.367
Nah, I don't care.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.901
Give it all away
to what's his name--

21:19.934 --> 21:22.033
the big guy with the curly hair.

21:22.067 --> 21:23.367
Your brother.

21:23.400 --> 21:24.100
Or him.

21:24.133 --> 21:25.501
Oh.

21:27.934 --> 21:31.868
You are not without
charm, my son.

21:31.901 --> 21:33.868
Thanks.

21:37.300 --> 21:40.200
All right. I'll tell
you what I'll do.

21:40.234 --> 21:42.868
I'm willing to try, if you are.

21:42.901 --> 21:44.968
If you want to be my son

21:45.000 --> 21:48.534
and feel what it's
like to be a rich man,

21:48.567 --> 21:51.868
then come home,
enroll in school.

21:51.901 --> 21:55.200
I'll see that you get
the best education

21:55.234 --> 21:58.300
and the best shave
that money can buy.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.400
All you have to do is take some
responsibility for yourself

22:04.434 --> 22:07.501
and lead a decent,
normal life.

22:11.767 --> 22:13.434
Good-bye, Dad.

22:21.501 --> 22:22.934
( <i>door shuts</i> )

22:22.968 --> 22:24.901
He's not coming back, is he?

22:24.934 --> 22:28.133
No, sir, I don't think so.

22:28.167 --> 22:29.467
Well, uh, listen...

22:29.501 --> 22:32.033

What are you doing?

22:48.634 --> 22:52.267
I'm saying good-bye
to your father.

22:52.300 --> 22:53.934
Oh.

22:53.968 --> 22:55.868
Tell him...

22:55.901 --> 23:00.467
it was really great
seeing him again!

23:00.501 --> 23:02.334
Uh, I think he wanted me...

23:02.367 --> 23:04.200
"It was really
great seeing..."
You heard...

23:04.234 --> 23:09.100
And get his right
phone number!

23:09.133 --> 23:11.267
Excuse me. Uh...

Got it!
