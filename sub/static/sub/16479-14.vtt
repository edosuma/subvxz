WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:04.136
Okay, we got our maps.
Got our canteens.
Yeah. Yeah.

00:04.138 --> 00:06.305
Got our trail mix,
homemade of course.

00:06.307 --> 00:07.306
Got my book of local fauna.

00:07.308 --> 00:08.607
Got my book of
local flora.

00:08.609 --> 00:09.675
So we can identify...

00:09.677 --> 00:10.876
BOTH:
♪ Every living thing. ♪

00:10.878 --> 00:12.111
SCHMIDT:
Look at them.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.613
I feel like Andie MacDowell
in<i> Multiplicity,</i>

00:14.615 --> 00:16.782
living in a house
filled with clones.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.350
It is the second time
this week

00:18.352 --> 00:20.619
you've compared yourself
to Andie MacDowell. It's weird.

00:20.621 --> 00:21.987
I'll go grab...
Our boots
because we should...

00:21.989 --> 00:23.455
Break them in.
Exactly.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.957
Nah, that's weird.

00:24.959 --> 00:26.992
Robby and I are hiking
Behar Pass tomorrow.

00:26.994 --> 00:28.827
Turns out, we both love hiking.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.796
It's amazing.
We have a lot in common.

00:30.798 --> 00:33.132
Aly and I are finally gonna
have the same city in common.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.533
Right on, man.
(Winston laughs)

00:34.535 --> 00:36.201
Lefty's coming home. (laughs)

00:36.203 --> 00:37.636
Lefty?
Lefty?

00:37.638 --> 00:38.570
Yeah, she's left-footed.

00:38.572 --> 00:39.972
I'm throwing Aly

00:39.974 --> 00:41.140
a surprise welcome-home dinner.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.342
I invited her whole family here,
you know.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.477
Uh, I wanted her to see
all the people she loves,

00:45.479 --> 00:47.813
which becomes love for me,
you know.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.149
And the next thing you know,
I'm getting one of those

00:50.151 --> 00:51.917
"best boyfriend ever" mugs,
which you can buy,

00:51.919 --> 00:53.652
I just don't want
to do all that.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.187
I want to... I want to earn it.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.156
You're inviting
them over here?
Yeah.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.991
Winston, this place
is a hellhole.

00:58.993 --> 01:00.859
Look at this.
All the dishes are broken.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.861
I'm eating pasta
out of some thing

01:02.863 --> 01:04.997
that Jess and Robby
made in a clay class.

01:04.999 --> 01:05.998
BOTH:
Pottery workshop.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
What the hell is
this compartment for?

01:08.002 --> 01:09.168
I have a better idea.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.669
Why don't you throw
your thing at our place?

01:10.671 --> 01:12.871
Ever since our wedding china
came in, we've been dying

01:12.873 --> 01:14.673
to host a dinner party.
Is your house even done yet?

01:14.675 --> 01:16.075
All the party zones
are in working order:

01:16.077 --> 01:17.342
living room,
dining room.

01:17.344 --> 01:19.778
The master bedroom
has sort of turned into

01:19.780 --> 01:21.013
a place where the workers

01:21.015 --> 01:22.247
throw all their trash.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.216
I think even one of them
went to the toilet in there.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.085
But... Yes.
We'll just lock
that door.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.187
Let's do it. Reagan's out of
town. You know what that means.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.521
No.
What does that mean?

01:29.523 --> 01:30.556
Honestly, I don't know,

01:30.558 --> 01:31.857
but please let me
come to the party.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.692
(gasps) Time to hit the sack.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.694
It's 6:30.
Babies are still awake.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.529
BOTH:
Not this baby.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.697
(Jess and Robby laugh)

01:38.699 --> 01:40.432
I feel like I've lived
through this before.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.035
I'm like Andie MacDowell
in<i> Groundhog Day.</i>

01:43.037 --> 01:45.037
Stop! Just please stop.
NICK: Are you kidding me?

01:45.039 --> 01:46.872
♪ ♪

01:49.043 --> 01:51.210
BOTH (to the tune of
"Ice Ice Baby"):
♪ Hike, hike, baby. ♪

01:51.212 --> 01:53.278
(imitating bass line)

01:54.882 --> 01:56.014
Ooh, it's a fork.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.384
Well, the map says to go left,

01:59.386 --> 02:01.620
but that little musket trail
seems plumb adorable.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.890
And it has a waterfall,
so I say, uh, waterfall.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.725
(both chuckle)

02:06.727 --> 02:07.926
I mean, let's just do it.
Let's go nuts.

02:07.928 --> 02:08.961
See, this is why
we're so great together.

02:08.963 --> 02:09.962
We agree on everything.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.563
I agree.
(chuckles)

02:11.565 --> 02:13.832
Hey, Robert Frost, looks like
we're gonna take the road...

02:13.834 --> 02:14.900
Jess traveled.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.069
(both laugh)

02:17.071 --> 02:19.138
All right, just, uh...

02:20.441 --> 02:21.507
That's not the way it goes.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.275
Hold on.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.344
Be easier if it wasn't so windy.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.914
Okay.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.249
Hey.
Hey.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.750
Made a list of rules
for our guests.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.752
Obviously, no one's wearing
shoes inside the house,

02:33.754 --> 02:35.621
but what if we put
a foot-washing station

02:35.623 --> 02:37.089
in the driveway?

02:37.091 --> 02:39.758
Babe, I was thinking
maybe we have no rules.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.593
Well, because growing up,

02:41.595 --> 02:43.595
all the cool houses
didn't have rules, remember?

02:43.597 --> 02:45.264
I was never invited
to any of the cool houses.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.132
My only friend in high school
was my piano teacher,

02:47.134 --> 02:48.867
and then he got that boyfriend
with the Trans Am,

02:48.869 --> 02:50.135
and I never saw him again.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.037
I really wish I could
travel back in time

02:52.039 --> 02:53.438
and give young you a hug.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.474
Yeah, well, young me
would've greeted that hug

02:55.476 --> 02:57.676
with an immediate collapse
in orgasm.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.144
Oh.
But you know what,
maybe you're right.

02:59.146 --> 03:02.614
If we want to be the place
where friends gather...

03:02.616 --> 03:04.116
maybe we got to chill.

03:04.118 --> 03:06.151
Yeah, because we...
we want to be the hub.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.953
You know?
Ooh, we'd make
such a good hub.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.688
Yes, we would.
Make such a good...

03:09.690 --> 03:11.190
We'd make such a good hub.

03:14.161 --> 03:15.561
Are you having an orgasm
right now?

03:17.531 --> 03:19.331
Are you kidding me?

03:19.333 --> 03:20.966
Hey.
Hey.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.701
Winston Bishop.
Nice to meet you.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.803
What are we doing right now?

03:24.805 --> 03:26.672
I'm practicing introducing
myself to Aly's parents.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.207
Oh, I got you.
You're a little nervous.
Yeah.

03:28.209 --> 03:29.374
Yeah, I'm a
little nervous.
Okay.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.809
You know, I want to make
a good first impression.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.878
Oh, that makes sense.
How's my shake?

03:32.880 --> 03:34.146
Nope. No, no, no, no, no.

03:34.148 --> 03:35.380
Do not go in with two hands.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.049
Also, why are your hands so wet?

03:37.051 --> 03:38.483
Damn, for me that's dry.
They're dripping.

03:38.485 --> 03:39.985
How's this for Aly's mom?
I'm Aly's mom?

03:39.987 --> 03:41.687
Okay.
Mm-mm.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.489
(smooches)
Not today, honey.
Yeah, all wrong.

03:44.491 --> 03:46.325
We bring it in for
the real thing.
All wrong.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.359
All wrong.
Okay.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.493
That was very aggressive.

03:48.495 --> 03:50.562
You invaded my space.
I didn't feel safe.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.863
Just be more
normal about it.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.332
Like this.
Hey, how are you?

03:53.334 --> 03:55.167
I'm Winston.
Nice to meet you.

03:55.169 --> 03:58.003
Oh, like, hey, how
are you? I'm Winston.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.038
Zip, a pleasure,
uh, to do it.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.207
See, all of that,
cut that out.
Okay.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.575
Hi, how are you?
I'm Aly's mother.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.844
(smooches)
You do... you do well.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.747
(chuckles) You do well
to-to be friends with me.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.383
Hmm?
Winston,
shake it out.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.585
(laughs)
I'm nervous, dude.
I know you are.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.053
Look, they're gonna love you.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.189
Here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna mill about.

04:17.191 --> 04:19.224
I'm gonna talk you up.
I'm gonna tell your stories.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.026
Yes. Use one of
my good ones,

04:21.028 --> 04:22.694
the ones that make
me look awesome.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.264
(chuckles) Like the time
I fell asleep in the bathtub.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.866
But all that one is is that
you fell asleep in a bathtub.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.801
The end. End of story.
That's amazing.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.236
I think we can come up
with better ones, don't you?

04:31.238 --> 04:34.239
No, that's a home run for
sure because I woke up wet.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.941
Now I see.
And also,

04:35.943 --> 04:37.209
it's all about
how you tell it.
Right.

04:37.211 --> 04:38.610
I trust you.
You're the writer.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.379
I am, and that was
the gift I was given.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.880
Put her there.
You got it.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.415
What is going on
with these hands?

04:43.417 --> 04:45.417
What?
A second ago,
they were dripping wet,

04:45.419 --> 04:47.219
and now they are piping hot.

04:47.221 --> 04:48.720
("La Cucaracha" doorbell plays)

04:48.722 --> 04:51.056
Leslie!
Winston!

04:51.058 --> 04:53.725
I hit your car
when I parked. Sorry.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.227
Yeah, I... I didn't drive here.

04:55.229 --> 04:56.628
Oh, well, that's a relief.

04:57.498 --> 04:58.897
Anyway, uh,

04:58.899 --> 05:00.899
your sister is on her way.
Where are your parents?

05:00.901 --> 05:03.835
Oh, my dad doesn't take highways
for political reasons.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.405
But everyone else is here.
Cool.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.806
Come on in. (laughs)

05:07.808 --> 05:08.974
Hey.
Hi there.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.642
Hey there. Hey.
Hi.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.777
Thank you.
Wow.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.412
How big is your family?
(chuckles)

05:13.414 --> 05:15.947
Oh, my gosh. Hey.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.749
How many cars did
you guys take?

05:17.751 --> 05:20.085
Hey, make yourselves at home.
Everybody come on in.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.787
Did you guys rent a bus?

05:21.789 --> 05:23.422
Just breathe.
Just breathe.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.123
Hey. Hey now.
SCHMIDT:
Winston, Winston.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.259
Winston.
A-A word, please.

05:27.261 --> 05:28.493
Huh? Yeah, coming.
Hey.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.594
Hey, man, you look familiar.

05:29.596 --> 05:30.629
Did I pull you
over last week?

05:30.631 --> 05:33.598
Why so many?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.600
CECE (quietly): There
are 30 people out there.

05:35.602 --> 05:36.435
(blows nose)

05:36.437 --> 05:37.436
SCHMIDT:
We do not have

05:37.438 --> 05:38.437
enough china!

05:38.439 --> 05:39.638
Or forks or prawns.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.006
You can't ask somebody
to split a prawn.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.942
Babe, I know, all right?
But you just need to relax.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.310
We will be fine.
We can adjust.
(glass breaks)
MAN: Sorry.

05:45.312 --> 05:47.446
Just remember, we're chill.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.781
No, you're right.
We are totally chill.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.450
We'll just break out
the backup china!

05:52.453 --> 05:53.452
I'll just come in
tomorrow morning

05:53.454 --> 05:54.619
with a power washer,

05:54.621 --> 05:56.121
and hose this whole
frickin' place down.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.856
("La Cucaracha" doorbell plays)
There's Lefty.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.826
By the way, there
is no backup china!

06:00.828 --> 06:02.160
I know, I know, all right.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.196
(crowd quiets)
Keep them closed.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.464
ALY: All right, last
time you did this,

06:05.466 --> 06:06.832
you revealed Furguson
in a tuxedo.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.467
(laughs)
This is even better.

06:08.469 --> 06:11.870
Say hello to...
your entire family!

06:11.872 --> 06:14.139
ALL:
Surprise!

06:14.141 --> 06:16.475
(whispers):
What the hell is this?

06:16.477 --> 06:19.244
(quietly): So, do the cute,
surprised look you do.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.147
Nah, that's not it.
That's not the one.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.383
Remember? When you...

06:28.722 --> 06:31.923
Oh. You're pissed.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.996
We're lost.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.332
Why did you let me
chase a waterfall?

06:40.334 --> 06:42.834
You know what TLC says.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.537
I'm sorry. Just...
I'm really hungry.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.239
Here. You can have
some of my trail mix.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.874
That's just a bag of raisins.
Well, that's because

06:48.876 --> 06:50.709
I only like to eat
the peanuts and the chocolate.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.544
Well, I only like the chocolate
and the peanuts, too!

06:52.546 --> 06:54.546
Why do we even add raisins?!

06:54.548 --> 06:55.847
I don't know!

06:55.849 --> 06:57.249
All right, look,
you know what,

06:57.251 --> 06:59.351
we're lost and...

06:59.353 --> 07:02.621
it's gonna get dark soon,
so let's... just head back.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.856
Fine. Did you pack a flashlight?

07:04.858 --> 07:06.024
Robby, did you pack
a flashlight?

07:06.026 --> 07:07.692
No.
Then there's your answer.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.060
You know what, it's fine, okay?

07:09.062 --> 07:11.196
We know that we have to go
downhill, so just follow me.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.197
I'll lead, okay?

07:12.199 --> 07:13.532
Ah! God! Oh!

07:13.534 --> 07:14.866
Oh! Robby! Oh, my God!
Oh!

07:14.868 --> 07:16.368
I lost my glasses.
Are you okay?

07:16.370 --> 07:17.936
Oh.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.538
Please tell me those were
crunchy leaves.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.739
Let me see.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.073
Oh, I think that's them.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.575
Hold on. Oh! Jess!
Ah!

07:23.577 --> 07:26.378
Ah! Ow, my ankle!

07:26.380 --> 07:29.381
My beautiful dancer's ankle!

07:29.383 --> 07:31.716
Hey. What's the matter?

07:31.718 --> 07:33.618
You know, I got all your
family together in one room.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.054
You know, you're being greeted
by all the people that you love.

07:36.056 --> 07:36.955
I know.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.089
Well, except for
your parents,

07:38.091 --> 07:39.157
but they will
be here soon,

07:39.159 --> 07:41.126
barring any surface
street traffic.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.727
That is so sweet, Winston.

07:42.729 --> 07:45.430
And I do love my family,
but they're crazy.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.599
And, honestly,
they make me a little crazy.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.767
Every family is crazy.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.002
Every time we get together,
it's a disaster.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.472
Like a giant hot air balloon
catching on fire.

07:53.474 --> 07:56.475
Here's the difference:
you got backup now.

07:57.911 --> 08:01.413
Have I ever let you down
as a partner?

08:01.415 --> 08:02.948
Except for that mixed
doubles tournament.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.182
Got it!

08:07.754 --> 08:10.288
We don't got to talk about that.
We ain't got to go back there.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.257
My point is this:
we're a team.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.792
Okay?

08:13.794 --> 08:15.260
Okay.
All right.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.928
Maybe this time will
be different, right?
Yeah.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.164
But you really need to know
the lay of the land.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.432
Okay, let me take notes.

08:20.434 --> 08:22.100
So, my sister is...

08:22.102 --> 08:24.102
my sister.
Mm-hmm.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.170
Uncle Bill is
a real weather nerd.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.138
It's super annoying.
Right, right, right.

08:27.140 --> 08:30.275
Aunt Karen keeps a free-floating
piece of floss in her purse.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.610
She will use it tonight.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.844
It's revolting.
Okay.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.179
Do me a favor. Hold on.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.380
Repeat everything
you just said.

08:35.382 --> 08:36.781
My thumbprint
won't let me in.

08:36.783 --> 08:39.684
Okay, uh, my sister is--
you met her...

08:39.686 --> 08:41.353
Ah, wait, yeah,
no, no, still not in.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.788
Let me get-- wipe my
hand off right there.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.824
Now we're cooking
with gas. (chuckles)

08:45.826 --> 08:47.692
My sister... Okay.
No, we ain't.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.128
Winston, he's a great guy.
Mm-hmm.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.130
He and I go way back.
Tons of stories, tons of...

08:52.132 --> 08:53.498
tons of stories.
Really?

08:53.500 --> 08:55.467
All right.
Right now?

08:55.469 --> 08:57.502
Yeah.
One time he was taking a bath
and he fell asleep.

08:57.504 --> 08:58.803
(wheezing laugh)

08:58.805 --> 09:01.806
You believe this guy?
What a nut.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.708
Life of the party, this guy.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.810
He fell asleep in a bath?
That's the story?

09:05.812 --> 09:07.145
That's the story? No.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.813
That's the start of the story.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.549
We are out of appetizers.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.484
They stripped this tray
of shrimp like piranhas.

09:12.486 --> 09:13.985
They didn't even
leave tails.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.987
I think someone took a shower
in the bathroom.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.989
We don't have
towels or soap.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.391
I don't know
how they did it.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.660
We need to reexamine
this whole no rules thing.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.328
It's a freaking
circus in here.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.829
What are we gonna feed
these people in the meantime?

09:24.831 --> 09:26.831
In about ten minutes, they're
gonna start eating the drywall.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.400
I think there was a...
(plate clanks loudly)

09:28.402 --> 09:30.168
(chuckles) Thank you.
Thank you.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.837
I think there was a bag of rice
in the house when we bought it.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.506
I thought that was barley.

09:34.508 --> 09:36.875
It was really dirty.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.010
Okay, fine, whatever.
Boil it up!

09:39.012 --> 09:41.546
ROBBY: Okay, well,
it's really dark and uneven,

09:41.548 --> 09:43.415
but at least we found the trail.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.917
Yeah, I mean, it's like
a night hike. (chuckles)

09:45.919 --> 09:48.053
Maybe we'll see a colony
of bats. (chuckles)

09:48.055 --> 09:49.521
It's kind of
like a waterfall.

09:49.523 --> 09:51.756
But with monsters,
in the sky.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.058
(thunder cracks)
Oh! Oh, man.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.225
Okay, uh,

09:54.227 --> 09:55.927
Jess, it's raining.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.529
JESS: Let's take
shelter in that cave!

09:57.531 --> 09:59.531
What if it's more of
a nest than a cave?

09:59.533 --> 10:01.399
Whatever. It'll do.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.233
Sister!

10:02.235 --> 10:03.735
(both squealing)

10:03.737 --> 10:05.370
(chuckles)

10:05.372 --> 10:07.272
WINSTON: Oh, that's some
sisterly love right there.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.406
Let me get you
two a drink.

10:08.408 --> 10:09.541
Okay. (squeals)

10:09.543 --> 10:14.045
Oh, my God,
Winston is so good for you.

10:14.047 --> 10:17.248
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

10:17.250 --> 10:18.717
And I saw with
my own eyes one day

10:18.719 --> 10:20.619
when Winston
saved those kids

10:20.621 --> 10:23.088
from a burning building,
including a little boy.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.724
A little boy who's dad left
when he was young.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.426
Named Wheelchair Timmy.

10:28.428 --> 10:31.062
Wheelchair Timmy was
a heavyset boy, ginger.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.731
Black eyes.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.400
So what, you think I'm just some
cold robot who needs some guy

10:35.402 --> 10:37.469
to loosen me up,
make me happy?

10:37.471 --> 10:39.270
I just said
Winston's good for you.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.406
Oh, my God,
you always get like this!

10:41.408 --> 10:44.476
He grabs the kid and the chair,
lifts him up above his head,

10:44.478 --> 10:47.746
so that the fire doesn't burn
this little heavyset boy.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.581
That's the power
of adrenaline.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.950
And what happened to Timmy?
Timmy? He's dead.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.985
What?
He's alive. I'm Timmy.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.587
Look at me now.

10:55.589 --> 10:57.789
Because of Winston,
I'm telling you this story.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.424
No, you said
your name was Nick.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.459
I<i> am</i> Nick. I got to go!

11:01.461 --> 11:03.161
How should I be, huh?
Like you?

11:03.163 --> 11:05.330
(mocking): "Oh, my God,
look at me, I'm Leslie.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.098
"I wear holiday socks
in the summer.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.801
I follow Ariana Grande around
like she was the Grateful Dead."

11:09.803 --> 11:10.935
(mocking):
"Oh, I'm Aly.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.604
"I went to Quantico
and I got a disease,

11:12.606 --> 11:14.773
and I can't be around people!"

11:14.775 --> 11:16.775
Do you mean "quarantine"?
Whatever!

11:16.777 --> 11:18.009
You're so mean!

11:18.011 --> 11:19.611
You're being a mean robot!

11:19.613 --> 11:21.179
No, this is being a mean robot.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.181
(robotic voice): "Beep, boop,
boop, boop. Leslie, you suck.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.449
"You can't pull off bangs.

11:24.451 --> 11:25.617
You were an accident."

11:25.619 --> 11:26.618
LESLIE:
Oh, my God!

11:26.620 --> 11:27.819
I have a small forehead,

11:27.821 --> 11:29.487
and you know that,
and you use that against me!

11:29.489 --> 11:30.789
Just shut up!

11:30.791 --> 11:33.658
I hate you!
I hate you! I...

11:33.660 --> 11:35.160
(Leslie sobs)

11:35.162 --> 11:37.395
(whispers):
God.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.999
(sighs) Oh, no.

11:41.001 --> 11:45.637
The wheelchair boy, Timmy,
speaks very highly of you.

11:45.639 --> 11:46.638
(chuckles)

11:46.640 --> 11:48.473
You're Aunt Karen?
Mm-hmm.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.008
You didn't make
a lot of sense.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.309
(grunts)

11:51.311 --> 11:54.412
Yeah, it's really
coming down out there.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.514
It's really freezing.

11:56.516 --> 11:57.415
Yeah.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.683
(thunder rumbling softly)

11:58.685 --> 12:01.386
Hey, Robby?

12:01.388 --> 12:03.488
Do you ever think it's, like...

12:04.691 --> 12:06.524
...it's not good
that we're so similar?

12:06.526 --> 12:08.059
Oh, I don't know.

12:08.061 --> 12:12.030
You know, my Great Uncle
Shep Wallingford used to say,

12:12.032 --> 12:14.532
"You buy the horse that
you see in the mirror."

12:14.534 --> 12:15.867
Did you say "Wallingford"?
Mm-hmm.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.536
I have Wallingfords
in my family, out near Boston.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.538
Ah, mine are in,
uh, Newburyport.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.173
They were kind of, like,
local celebrities.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.408
They were well-known
for making...

12:23.410 --> 12:25.343
BOTH:
Women's watches.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.678
How'd you know that?

12:26.680 --> 12:28.680
♪ Wallingford watches ♪

12:28.682 --> 12:30.515
BOTH:
♪ 'Cause the time is now ♪

12:30.517 --> 12:31.683
♪ And the look is wow! ♪

12:31.685 --> 12:32.751
(chuckles)

12:41.228 --> 12:44.195
Robby...

12:44.197 --> 12:46.164
I think we're related.

12:47.701 --> 12:49.734
(thunder rumbles)

12:49.736 --> 12:52.337
(Jess and Robby screaming)

12:55.475 --> 12:58.543
(Jess and Robby screaming)

12:58.545 --> 12:59.711
Do you have an Uncle Tony?

12:59.713 --> 13:00.945
Tony, with the long fingernails,

13:00.947 --> 13:02.881
and he always wears a whistle
around his neck.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.315
Robby, we are third cousins.

13:04.317 --> 13:08.419
Oh, my God! Why, God?!
Ah! We're going to hell!

13:08.421 --> 13:09.954
(groans)
We did stuff.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.056
No, stop! I can't live
in this reality!
Just saying.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.958
At least not second cousins.
Ah, I can't.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.593
First cousins
would be way worse.
Please, no.

13:15.595 --> 13:18.897
People do it all the time,
in the, in the mountains.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.398
In the mountains.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.466
(retches)

13:25.238 --> 13:26.738
Don't be startled.
God!

13:26.740 --> 13:27.906
What are you doing
in here, Cece?

13:27.908 --> 13:29.607
I am hiding, okay?

13:29.609 --> 13:31.309
That party is out of control.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.777
Some guy almost burned
his eyebrows off

13:32.779 --> 13:34.479
trying to light
a cigarette on our stove.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.947
It's complete
anarchy in there.

13:35.949 --> 13:38.283
Can we just hide in here
and hang out together?

13:38.285 --> 13:40.418
We haven't christened
the garage yet.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.420
Ooh, you make
a very good point.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.621
Okay.
WINSTON:
Hey.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.590
Hello, Winston.
Hey.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.358
Question: have you
guys seen Aly?
(sighs)

13:47.360 --> 13:48.760
What's going on, man?

13:48.762 --> 13:51.262
She ran off. If I'd known
it was gonna be like this,

13:51.264 --> 13:53.097
I would've just done
the trench coat thing.

13:53.099 --> 13:54.432
The... what?
What is the trench coat thing?

13:54.434 --> 13:55.500
It's where I pick her up
from the airport naked,

13:55.502 --> 13:56.634
wearing nothing
but a trench coat.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.336
Have you guys seen
a kid in a wheelchair?

13:58.338 --> 14:00.605
That was me.
What?
Whoa!
Wow.

14:00.607 --> 14:01.840
Nick, what are you
doing in here?

14:01.842 --> 14:03.875
Look, I was having a hard time
with your stories,

14:03.877 --> 14:05.643
so I took
a little poetic license.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.345
People started
asking some questions.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.546
Things got ahead of me.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.782
And I had no choice
but to hide in the car.

14:10.784 --> 14:12.283
Nick, I thought you were gonna
stick to the tub story.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.052
It's not a story, Winston.
It's not a story!

14:14.054 --> 14:15.053
A story about sleeping...
It's mental.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.955
Hey.
Found her.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.857
Yeah.
Are you guys ever not together?

14:18.859 --> 14:20.625
Rarely.
You know what?
Hold on one second.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.660
I want to talk to you.
Guys, can you give us a minute?

14:22.662 --> 14:25.129
Sure, Winston. Cece,
let's go hide in the car...

14:25.131 --> 14:26.631
in the garage
of our home.

14:26.633 --> 14:27.899
Yeah, okay.

14:30.804 --> 14:33.371
We'll give you guys a minute.

14:33.373 --> 14:37.342
Aly, uh, I was just
trying to be sweet and...

14:37.344 --> 14:39.544
And I ruined it. I know.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.512
I said my family was crazy,

14:41.514 --> 14:44.015
and I ended up being
the craziest one.

14:44.017 --> 14:47.719
Look, I'm so embarrassed
you saw that side of me,

14:47.721 --> 14:49.821
and I'm sure you want
to run for the hills.

14:49.823 --> 14:51.656
So, it's fine.
I don't blame you.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.825
You're embarrassed of being
crazy in front of<i> me?</i>

14:53.827 --> 14:54.859
I acted insane.

14:54.861 --> 14:57.495
Even just talking about it
is humiliating.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.031
I'm just gonna, yeah,
I'm gonna walk away.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.232
Okay.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.671
Oh, dear Lord.
The car's running.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.373
Nick, how long have
you been in here?

15:08.375 --> 15:10.375
Been running
this whole time?
I was cold. I was cold.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.877
Did you ever go
to one of those big

15:12.879 --> 15:14.679
Wallingford
family cookouts?

15:14.681 --> 15:16.514
Just one, in '92.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.850
I remember they had a really
competitive three-legged race,

15:18.852 --> 15:21.252
and they paired me up with a
little boy who had a helmet on.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.353
His skin was
so translucent,

15:22.355 --> 15:24.555
it was like he was a jellyfish.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.858
Did he play
an imaginary trombone?
Yeah.

15:26.860 --> 15:29.460
He kept saying, "It's better
to be safe than speedy."

15:29.462 --> 15:31.529
That was me! That was me!
Oh, my God.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.197
Oh, this is too much.

15:33.199 --> 15:35.867
I don't want to die
with my cousin-lover in a cave.

15:35.869 --> 15:37.568
Oh, God.
Everyone will think we fled here

15:37.570 --> 15:39.137
'cause society
wouldn't accept us.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.306
I just wanted to see
a waterfall.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.141
Me, too!
I got to get out of here!

15:43.143 --> 15:44.442
You can't walk,
I can't see anything.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.711
Stand up, blind boy.
I'm getting on your back.

15:46.713 --> 15:47.812
Take these.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.113
Oh, okay.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.915
Oh, man. Okay.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.383
Oh, we have
the same prescription.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.819
Yeah, no kidding, Robby.
All right, you ready?

15:54.821 --> 15:57.088
Yeah. So, "Wallingfords"
on three?
No! Ew!

15:57.090 --> 15:58.389
I'm really sorry.
I'm so nervous.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.991
Okay, one, two, three!
Two, three!

15:59.993 --> 16:01.793
(both yelling)

16:01.795 --> 16:03.561
ROBBY: I didn't wear
the right shoes for this!

16:03.563 --> 16:05.396
JESS:
Go over there!

16:08.501 --> 16:10.468
I'm sorry about before.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.503
I guess I really
freaked out on you.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.839
And I'm sorry that I told you

16:14.841 --> 16:17.075
I was gonna shave your eyebrows
off in your sleep.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.844
You never said that.
Oh, maybe I was
just thinking that.

16:19.846 --> 16:22.246
I'm just so embarrassed
Winston saw that.

16:22.248 --> 16:23.815
I'm pretty sure
I scared him off.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.350
No, you didn't.
He's on the table.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.417
(tapping glass)

16:26.419 --> 16:27.852
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

16:27.854 --> 16:28.853
WINSTON:
Hello.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.521
I am Winston Bishop.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.190
I'm Aly's boyfriend.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.524
Please, if you will,

16:33.526 --> 16:36.194
I want to, uh, say a few words
to my girlfriend.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.428
He's standing
on the furniture.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.130
Just relax, okay?
Help is on the way.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.532
Aly, I wanted you
to feel special tonight

16:41.534 --> 16:44.869
because... I'm wild about you.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.471
Maybe things didn't

16:46.473 --> 16:49.474
go perfectly, but damn it,
don't be embarrassed

16:49.476 --> 16:51.476
to be crazy in front of me.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.544
Okay? I am the king of crazy.

16:53.546 --> 16:54.612
(chuckles)

16:54.614 --> 16:56.214
I have inside jokes with my cat.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.949
I am a member

16:57.951 --> 16:59.784
of the Puzzling Guild
of North America.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.220
I shave my face cold,
and I brush my teeth hot.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.888
It's true.
On one very late

17:03.890 --> 17:05.556
and very desperate night,

17:05.558 --> 17:08.893
I used Furguson's cat box
as my own box.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.895
And, yes, it is true

17:10.897 --> 17:12.330
what many of you
have heard.

17:12.332 --> 17:15.466
I once fell asleep
in a bathtub!

17:15.468 --> 17:18.202
(laughing)

17:18.204 --> 17:20.905
I love that story.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.673
(continues laughing)

17:22.675 --> 17:23.841
And then what happened?

17:23.843 --> 17:25.343
What do you mean,
"And then what happened?"

17:25.345 --> 17:27.011
He fell asleep
in the tub!

17:27.013 --> 17:29.514
He was asleep,
and then he woke up.

17:29.516 --> 17:30.982
(stomping on table)

17:30.984 --> 17:33.418
I don't know, maybe
I got to hear it again.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.652
So who cares if you're crazy?

17:34.654 --> 17:35.920
I don't care. I'm crazy, too.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.255
(scoffs) Watch this.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.490
I'm gonna put a carrot
behind my ear,

17:39.492 --> 17:41.859
like a bunny reporter,
and I'm gonna do this dance

17:41.861 --> 17:43.428
I've been working on
for five years.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.829
(grunting rhythmically)

17:44.831 --> 17:46.664
Don't you do that carrot.

17:46.666 --> 17:47.665
Little bunny carrot.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.267
(imitates chewing)

17:49.269 --> 17:51.736
(Winston mumbling
goofy noises)

17:56.409 --> 17:58.876
(laughs)

17:58.878 --> 18:00.278
I see we got
two new...

18:00.280 --> 18:02.847
people here.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.282
Who are they?

18:04.284 --> 18:07.785
Yeah, um, Mom, Dad,

18:07.787 --> 18:09.220
this is Winston.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.455
Hey.

18:10.457 --> 18:11.789
(chuckles)

18:11.791 --> 18:14.725
Uh... I am Winston.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.195
And I assure you that
all of those incidents

18:17.197 --> 18:19.363
were from a very long
time ago, kinda.

18:19.365 --> 18:20.465
Really?

18:20.467 --> 18:22.300
It's clear
you love our daughter.

18:22.302 --> 18:26.637
In a very passionate,
unique way.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.873
That's all that matters.

18:28.875 --> 18:29.707
(chuckles)

18:29.709 --> 18:30.708
(mouthing)

18:30.710 --> 18:32.477
You're a two-hander, huh?

18:32.479 --> 18:33.478
(laughs)

18:33.480 --> 18:34.812
Well, all right.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.314
Okay.
Mm, yes.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.149
Okay.
Okay.

18:38.151 --> 18:40.218
Seriously, we've been on
the road for a couple of hours.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.253
We need to use the bathroom.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course!

18:42.255 --> 18:44.655
It's, uh, right down,
right down the hall.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.624
(chuckles)

18:46.626 --> 18:51.062
Thank you for not being
afraid of me or my family.

18:54.667 --> 18:55.867
(knocking)
Open up. Police!

18:56.936 --> 18:59.070
Who-who called the police?
I don't know.

18:59.072 --> 19:01.772
I guess we better do
whatever they say. Ugh.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.175
Why are you guys acting
like you're in a porno?

19:04.177 --> 19:05.676
(sighs)

19:05.678 --> 19:07.278
We got a noise complaint.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.413
The law has spoken,
everyone.

19:09.415 --> 19:10.748
I guess the party's over.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.183
You could just
file out through here.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.184
Winston?

19:13.186 --> 19:14.685
(chuckles):
Look who it is.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.087
Hey, Aly, you're back.

19:16.089 --> 19:18.022
Jenkins, get in here, man!
We having a party.

19:18.024 --> 19:19.457
What you drinking?
Hi, Jenkins.

19:19.459 --> 19:20.858
Wait, what?

19:20.860 --> 19:22.026
(laughs)

19:22.028 --> 19:23.995
Well, you know what,
I guess I'm just gonna

19:23.997 --> 19:25.963
have to take the law
into my own hands.

19:25.965 --> 19:26.931
All right, everybody!

19:28.301 --> 19:30.468
Shoes off, coasters down!

19:30.470 --> 19:33.671
This is our house,
and our house has rules!

19:33.673 --> 19:34.872
Okay?

19:34.874 --> 19:36.374
Not a suggestion.
Shoes off, let's go!

19:36.376 --> 19:37.642
Shoes!
Okay, okay. Shoes off.

19:37.644 --> 19:38.943
SCHMIDT:
Take your shoes off...

19:38.945 --> 19:41.546
Get 'em off! Yep!
...and put 'em to the side!

19:41.548 --> 19:43.314
And then let's have
a good time.
Yeah, let's have some fun.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.549
It's a party, people.
It's a party.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.384
ROBBY:
So just to be clear,

19:46.386 --> 19:49.220
um, we're definitely
broken up, right?

19:49.222 --> 19:50.888
Yeah.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.690
Yeah, I mean, that's...
Yeah. I mean...

19:52.692 --> 19:55.059
I don't know
why I asked.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.296
All right, well...

20:04.737 --> 20:06.637
Oh, wait. You
should take these.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.906
Oh, you know, keep 'em.
They look great on you.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.641
Thank you.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.814
I'll see you around.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.416
Yeah.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.084
Maybe at the next family reun...

20:20.086 --> 20:22.486
Too soon. Yep.
A little too soon. Yes.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.989
Oh, dear Lord.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.324
It's not as bad
as it looks.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.492
I'm really, I'm really clean
underneath all this mud.

20:28.494 --> 20:30.261
Oh, my God, what happened?

20:30.263 --> 20:31.696
(sighs) Hike took a turn,

20:31.698 --> 20:33.931
and then Robby and I
broke up in a cave.

20:33.933 --> 20:37.535
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
I am so sorry.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.837
Air hug.
Yeah. I'm gonna go get
you a glass of wine.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.339
Real sorry about you and Robby.
Don't touch anything.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.773
I'm gonna go get
some paper towels.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.609
Don't-don't move.

20:44.611 --> 20:45.943
Whoa, Jess! Are you okay?

20:45.945 --> 20:47.278
Ugh, long story.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.213
But I'm okay.
Is there any food left?

20:49.215 --> 20:52.783
I'm so hungry, and all I have
is this bag of gross raisins.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.219
Gross raisins?
Are you kidding me?

20:55.221 --> 20:57.121
Raisins are the best.
I love raisins.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.623
(laughs):
Of course you do.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.691
Yeah, sometimes I just
tuck 'em in my cheek,

21:00.693 --> 21:02.693
and I go about my day,
so if I ever need

21:02.695 --> 21:04.528
the flavor of raisins,
well, I already got it.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.698
I'm having trouble
envisioning what it's like

21:07.700 --> 21:10.234
to need the flavor
of raisons.

21:10.236 --> 21:11.569
But go nuts.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.304
Go raisins. (laughs)

21:13.306 --> 21:14.972
You said, "Go nuts,"
I said, "Go raisins."

21:14.974 --> 21:16.307
CECE:
Wine.

21:16.309 --> 21:17.475
Paper towels.
JESS: Oh, thank you, Schmidt.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.909
Thanks. Oh, thanks.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.745
Thanks. Thank you.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.546
SCHMIDT: Just step on these.
NICK: Go faster.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.148
JESS: Uh, I have
enough paper towels.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.150
WINSTON: Hey!
JESS: Hey!

21:26.152 --> 21:27.985
Hey, what's up?
Not much.

21:27.987 --> 21:28.986
Welcome to the party.
Thanks.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.721
Where's Robby?

21:30.723 --> 21:32.590
JESS: Oh, yeah, um,
he couldn't make it.

21:32.592 --> 21:33.991
Turns out we're cousins, so...

21:33.993 --> 21:35.926
NICK: What?! He's your cousin?
CECE: What?

21:35.928 --> 21:37.962
JESS: House looks great.
NICK: Wait a second.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.063
CECE: How did you
figure that out?
NICK: Cousin?

21:39.065 --> 21:41.132
