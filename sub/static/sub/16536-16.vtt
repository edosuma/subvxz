WEBVTT

00:01.085 --> 00:02.294
<i>Previously on "Designated Survivor"...</i>

00:02.420 --> 00:05.256
President Moss wants
to get back into politics.

00:05.381 --> 00:08.217
Your country needs you,
preferably as Secretary of State.

00:09.093 --> 00:10.970
- Work for me.
- You're working for Kimble Hookstraten?

00:11.095 --> 00:13.639
She's the head of the Republican Party,
and you're a card-carrying Democrat.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.391
I'm looking to redefine the playing field.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.602
Senator Bowman, you and I have
very different opinions on gun safety.

00:18.728 --> 00:20.646
I will be re-introducing Bill 8180,

00:20.771 --> 00:22.481
which strengthens
federal background checks.

00:22.606 --> 00:25.568
I happen to oppose this bill, but
in the spirit of bipartisan discussion,

00:25.693 --> 00:27.153
<i>I'd like to put it before the Senate.</i>

00:27.278 --> 00:28.487
He's hijacking our agenda.

00:28.612 --> 00:29.905
Get ready for a fight.

00:30.031 --> 00:32.450
The woman who killed Luke...
I'm going after her myself.

00:32.575 --> 00:34.243
Let her go!

00:38.956 --> 00:39.957
Oh, my God.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.820
Agent Wells,
what do you have for me?

01:09.945 --> 01:12.114
These were found at the home
of Brooke Mathison,

01:12.239 --> 01:14.325
the woman that Charles Langdon
knew as Claudine.

01:18.996 --> 01:21.290
This looks like the
Capitol threat assessment file.

01:21.624 --> 01:24.210
It was created by the same
strategic group at the Pentagon.

01:24.335 --> 01:27.213
It highlights vulnerabilities
at the Golden Gate Bridge...

01:27.338 --> 01:29.006
the Hoover Dam...

01:30.174 --> 01:31.967
the Statue of Liberty.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.386
How many more?

01:34.512 --> 01:36.472
This is all we found.

01:37.181 --> 01:39.266
Langdon didn't say anything
about more attacks.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.811
It's very possible he didn't know.

01:41.936 --> 01:44.146
Then how'd this Claudine woman
get her hands on these?

01:44.271 --> 01:45.356
These are highly classified.

01:45.481 --> 01:46.816
We don't know yet.

01:48.484 --> 01:50.569
Thousands of people visit
these places daily.

01:50.694 --> 01:53.364
These could be rejected sites
for attacks.

01:54.156 --> 01:56.158
Or they could be plans
for attacks to come.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.537
Yeah. We're combing through
Brooke Mathison's hard drives,

01:59.662 --> 02:02.665
- trying to find any clues we can.
- I'll tell the President.

02:03.165 --> 02:06.210
He needs to be informed right away.

02:20.141 --> 02:22.560
We've alerted DHS to a credible threat.

02:22.685 --> 02:25.396
They're sweeping all three sites
without alerting the public.

02:25.521 --> 02:27.273
I want to know
the second they find anything.

02:27.398 --> 02:29.608
We also need to update
emergency evacuation plans

02:29.733 --> 02:30.943
for those three areas.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.236
Of course, sir.

02:32.361 --> 02:34.238
- Mr. President.
- Yes?

02:34.363 --> 02:36.949
You have the press in five minutes, sir.
Do you need more time?

02:37.074 --> 02:39.910
No, we're fine. We're done here.
Thank you, Mike.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.787
Lily, I'll be right with you.

02:43.581 --> 02:45.958
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.294
Thank you, Seth.

02:48.419 --> 02:49.545
Please, everybody, be seated.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.422
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:51.547 --> 02:53.632
As you all know, we have
an incredibly busy day today.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.968
So if we could just get started. Carla.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.053
Mr. President, the Senate has introduced

02:58.179 --> 03:00.806
the first major legislation
of your presidency.

03:00.931 --> 03:02.975
Do you support Senate Bill 8180,

03:03.100 --> 03:05.394
expanding background checks
for gun sales?

03:05.519 --> 03:06.312
Yes, I do.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.981
<i>As I said in the town hall,</i>

03:09.106 --> 03:12.443
<i>I believe that we have a responsibility
to do anything that we can</i>

03:12.568 --> 03:14.570
<i>to reduce the level
of gun violence in our country.</i>

03:14.695 --> 03:17.656
<i>And I think that this bill is
an important step in that direction.</i>

03:17.781 --> 03:21.160
<i>Are you concerned about political
fallout, tackling such a polarizing issue</i>

03:21.285 --> 03:22.912
<i>so early in your term?</i>

03:23.037 --> 03:26.624
<i>No, I think passing good laws is more
important than political posturing.</i>

03:26.749 --> 03:29.293
<i>And even though this issue
is polarizing in some regard,</i>

03:29.418 --> 03:32.838
<i>84% of Americans believe in stronger
background checks. Joel.</i>

03:32.963 --> 03:37.301
Staying with that, sir, many observers say
the language of the bill is flawed.

03:37.426 --> 03:40.846
- Can you respond?
- Certainly. I think they're right.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.350
Um, but if the Senate passes
the bill to the House,

03:44.475 --> 03:47.603
I will be committed to working with
Republicans, Democrats, and Independents

03:47.728 --> 03:51.190
<i>to make sure that we pass a law
that will ultimately make us safer.</i>

03:51.315 --> 03:53.817
That's funny.
Nobody's reached out to me.

03:53.943 --> 03:57.154
- Well, he's reaching out now.
<i>- I want to remind you,</i>

03:57.279 --> 03:59.365
<i>this bill is not about
taking guns away from people.</i>

03:59.490 --> 04:02.952
It's about making sure they don't fall
into the wrong hands in the first place.

04:04.328 --> 04:06.538
Initial social media response
to the bill is mixed.

04:06.664 --> 04:08.999
Well, they don't call it
a third rail for nothing.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.209
Well, it's still pretty positive,
considering.

04:10.334 --> 04:12.878
We'll make sure the data gets out
on all the White House channels,

04:13.003 --> 04:14.505
make sure people know
the numbers check out,

04:14.630 --> 04:16.130
and in terms of public engagement,

04:16.257 --> 04:18.384
Mrs. Kirkman is hosting
a roundtable discussion today

04:18.509 --> 04:20.052
with a number of stakeholders.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.221
People, Seth: mothers, fathers,
daughters, sons.

04:22.346 --> 04:23.889
We can never forget that.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.558
Yes, sir. Uh... I'll go check
on Mrs. Kirkman now.

04:26.684 --> 04:28.560
- Okay, thank you.
- Speaking of numbers, sir,

04:28.686 --> 04:31.855
we need to get 51 Senate votes
in two days, which is not gonna be easy.

04:31.981 --> 04:34.066
The language of the bill is not ideal,
as you know.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.986
That's why Senator Bowman picked it.
He's trying to back me into a corner.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.737
Well, nobody puts Baby in a corner, sir.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.240
I didn't think you were
old enough to know that movie.

04:41.365 --> 04:43.409
I had to.
But we're gonna get you out of it.

04:43.534 --> 04:46.328
Diane Hunter, the minority leader,
is on her way here shortly.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.372
If anyone's gonna back us on this,
it's the Democrats.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.291
Unfortunately, there's only 46 of them.

04:51.834 --> 04:53.752
Good morning, ma'am.
I was just coming to see you.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.921
- Did you get the briefing memo?
- Yes, I did. Thank you.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.715
Great. So, we'll be in the Roosevelt Room.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.758
Public Engagement
has put together 12 people,

04:59.883 --> 05:01.760
men and women
from all over the country,

05:01.885 --> 05:05.097
good cross section on age and race,
and each one of them has, unfortunately,

05:05.222 --> 05:06.598
- lost somebody due to gun violence.
- Wow.

05:06.724 --> 05:08.350
So it's not gonna be an easy day,

05:08.475 --> 05:11.353
but their stories will remind people
of why this is so important.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.272
And keep pressure on the Senate
for this bill.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.107
Yes, exactly.
Although I wouldn't mention

05:15.232 --> 05:17.609
the bill specifically.
Today's really just about listening.

05:17.735 --> 05:20.904
- You don't want to make promises.
- Seth, please don't worry.

05:21.030 --> 05:24.450
- I have learned my lesson.
- That's not what I meant, ma'am.

05:24.575 --> 05:27.578
Oh, yes, it is.
And it's okay, it's your job.

05:27.703 --> 05:30.122
Okay. Um, there is a pool spray
at the top -

05:30.247 --> 05:31.373
a couple of reporters -

05:31.498 --> 05:33.292
but everything's off the record
once the meeting begins.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.794
- It's just you and them.
- Okay.

05:35.919 --> 05:38.589
You know, when Tom and I
got into the White House,

05:38.714 --> 05:40.799
I had no idea what to expect.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.968
But this...

05:43.093 --> 05:45.763
talking about things
that really matter to people...

05:46.263 --> 05:49.141
this is exactly what I hoped for.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.894
- Thank you for helping.
- Thank you, ma'am.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.983
Bringing this bill out of committee
is a pure power move by Bowman.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.652
I mean, he may be new to the Senate,
but he's no virgin.

06:00.778 --> 06:02.821
No kidding. The man resigned
from the governor's office

06:02.946 --> 06:04.406
so he could be appointed
to the Senate.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.451
He's trying to jack his national profile
as fast as he can.

06:07.576 --> 06:10.245
And it's working. There's already talk
of a Bowman White House run.

06:10.371 --> 06:12.998
And he's trying to eliminate
his competition, ma'am.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.334
I mean, introducing this bill
without consulting you?

06:15.459 --> 06:17.336
He's trying to take you out
at the knees.

06:17.461 --> 06:19.463
Yes, well...

06:19.588 --> 06:21.465
as the ranking Republican
on the Hill,

06:21.590 --> 06:23.258
I have to be careful
about how to respond.

06:23.384 --> 06:26.845
- He's still a member of my party.
- Respectfully, ma'am, I disagree.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.847
I think you need to push back...

06:28.972 --> 06:30.724
hard, before it's <i>his</i> party.

06:31.642 --> 06:35.062
Show him. He's not the only alpha dog
in Congress.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.943
Senator Hunter,
thank you very much for coming.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.112
I believe you know my Chief of Staff,
Emily Rhodes.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.613
Nice to see you again, Senator.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.864
- Likewise.
- Please.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.700
Mr. President, I admired
your statement this morning.

06:48.826 --> 06:51.161
Thank you very much.
Let's take a seat.

06:53.497 --> 06:58.669
Obviously, we're counting on the support
of the Democrats in the Senate on SB8180.

06:58.794 --> 07:00.879
And given your previous record
as Attorney General

07:01.004 --> 07:02.673
of the great state of Massachusetts,

07:02.798 --> 07:05.050
I'm trusting that
I can count on you as an ally.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.802
I am proud to say
that Massachusetts

07:06.927 --> 07:09.304
has some of the strongest
gun regulations in the country.

07:09.430 --> 07:12.641
Of course, I'd like to see universal
background checks as the law of the land.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.227
I understand that this bill
might not go as far as you want,

07:15.352 --> 07:18.021
but I believe that it starts the ball
rolling in the right direction.

07:18.147 --> 07:22.901
That isn't the only issue. SB8180
is flawed, fatally, some would say.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.237
We will work the language
of the bill in the House...

07:25.362 --> 07:27.197
but if we don't get it past the Senate,

07:27.322 --> 07:29.700
I don't know if we're gonna get
another chance at this.

07:29.825 --> 07:31.243
I agree with you, Mr. President,

07:31.368 --> 07:35.038
which is why I'm willing to convince
my colleagues to fall in line.

07:35.539 --> 07:36.915
I'm very glad to hear that.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.917
Yeah, but even
if every Democrat in the Senate

07:39.042 --> 07:40.752
votes for this bill,
it's not enough to pass.

07:40.878 --> 07:42.880
You'll still need five Republicans.

07:43.005 --> 07:44.673
Yes, we know it's going to be
a challenge.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.842
You're not just competing
against Jack Bowman here, sir.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.928
This is the gun lobby.
This is the Second Amendment folks.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.722
It's going to be expensive,

07:52.222 --> 07:54.766
and we need to know
that you won't give away too much.

07:54.892 --> 07:57.394
- What exactly do you mean?
- I mean...

07:58.395 --> 08:00.314
we don't know your red line.

08:00.898 --> 08:03.192
But I can tell you
what we won't tolerate.

08:04.234 --> 08:07.112
If we get a whiff
of tax cuts for the rich

08:07.237 --> 08:11.909
or cuts to Medicare or Social Security,
we will back out of this bill.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.745
You have my word, Senator.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.789
- I'm right there with you.
- Good.

08:17.915 --> 08:20.042
And good luck, Mr. President.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.085
I'm afraid you're going to need it.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.882
<i>Freedom.</i>

08:27.007 --> 08:31.053
<i>It's what makes America great:
a fight that never ends.</i>

08:31.178 --> 08:33.931
<i>And as the brave forces
of the United States Military</i>

08:34.056 --> 08:36.390
<i>deploy to trouble spots
around the world,</i>

08:36.517 --> 08:40.145
<i>Browning-Reed is right there
beside them.</i>

08:40.270 --> 08:43.148
<i>Browning-Reed is the tip of the spear
when it comes to security strategy--</i>

08:43.273 --> 08:45.984
Browning-Reed was established in 1993.

08:46.109 --> 08:47.653
For its first 20 years in operation,

08:47.778 --> 08:49.905
it was the go-to private military
for the Pentagon.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.448
Yeah, I remember.
Some of their employees

08:51.573 --> 08:53.283
shot up a bunch of civilians
in Afghanistan.

08:53.408 --> 08:56.119
Right, and they bribed Afghan authorities
to cover it up.

08:56.245 --> 08:57.496
That's charming.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.498
The whole place stunk from the top down.

08:59.623 --> 09:02.125
Anyway, the company
was dissolved last July.

09:02.251 --> 09:04.002
All that's left is some
real-estate holdings,

09:04.127 --> 09:06.672
which they're oddly still paying
property taxes on.

09:06.797 --> 09:09.758
One of the properties
is Brooke Mathison's house,

09:09.883 --> 09:11.927
where we found the threat assessments.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.348
They also have property
in Driggs, North Dakota,

09:16.473 --> 09:17.933
30 miles outside of Devil's Lake.

09:18.976 --> 09:22.271
- That looks like the middle of nowhere.
- Right?

09:22.396 --> 09:25.023
So why would Brooke Mathison fly
to North Dakota four times

09:25.148 --> 09:28.986
between February 2011
and September 2015?

09:30.946 --> 09:32.614
We got to find out what's out there.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.491
Yeah, well, not alone. Take backup.

09:36.451 --> 09:37.703
I'm gonna call Jason.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.037
Are you kidding me?

09:39.162 --> 09:41.123
He's a liability. He's not stable.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.543
John, they had his kid.
What would you have done?

09:44.668 --> 09:47.879
I'm trying to look out for you. He's your
friend but it doesn't mean he's qualified

09:48.005 --> 09:50.299
- to be part of this.
- The President gave me direct orders

09:50.424 --> 09:52.718
to use whatever means necessary
to uncover this conspiracy.

09:52.843 --> 09:56.847
I get to choose who I work with, John,
and I choose Atwood.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.932
We'll check in when we get there.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.900
Mr. President.

10:09.026 --> 10:11.028
Welcome back.
How did New York go?

10:11.153 --> 10:14.197
Well, my Russian's a bit rusty,
but we got the job done.

10:14.323 --> 10:17.075
UN Peacekeepers are heading
for Naruba as we speak.

10:17.200 --> 10:21.079
- Fantastic. How did you do it?
- Some good-old Texas horse trading.

10:21.204 --> 10:25.000
You know, in the end, we've got
a lot more in common than we think.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.878
Except maybe you and Jack Bowman.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.505
I see where you decided
to throw down on his bill.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.383
Yeah. Do you think it was a mistake?

10:34.301 --> 10:35.677
Do you?

10:36.970 --> 10:39.556
When I heard that woman speak
at the town hall, I didn't.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.809
When I talked to the press this morning,
I didn't.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.021
But even the Democrats
don't sound very optimistic.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.398
Welcome to the Hill.

10:48.523 --> 10:50.567
Many men have died on it.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.737
- Is that supposed to be a pep talk?
- It's a reality check.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.281
The American people like you, Tom.

10:56.406 --> 11:00.118
You're an outsider, and you don't owe
anything to anyone.

11:00.243 --> 11:03.413
But that means nobody owes you, either.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.458
I'm not very good
at the Washington game yet.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.960
To be fair, you've never really
been in the game.

11:09.086 --> 11:12.255
And as for that bill,
well, the wording is piss-poor,

11:12.381 --> 11:14.466
but it's got the right guts.

11:14.591 --> 11:17.803
And more importantly,
it's the bill you've got.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.472
Forget about how you got here, Tom.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.808
It's just like generals
throughout history.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.310
You don't always get
to choose your terrain.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.646
The only thing that matters now...

11:27.771 --> 11:30.273
is fighting the war
that's in front of you.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.943
And it ain't a mistake if you win.

11:33.944 --> 11:35.779
Then we better get those 51 votes.

11:42.953 --> 11:43.954
Cream?

11:44.079 --> 11:46.331
My father always said a man
only needs two things to live:

11:46.456 --> 11:48.959
black coffee and Irish whiskey.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.253
Sounds like your father
must've worked in Washington.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.504
Please.

11:52.629 --> 11:56.633
No, ma'am, he, uh... he raised cattle
in Northwest Montana for 38 years.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.427
I come by the boots honestly.

11:58.552 --> 12:01.513
Well, for an outsider,
you certainly are jumping right in.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.598
I'm not sure what you mean.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.309
I know you want
to embarrass the President,

12:06.435 --> 12:08.145
make him choke on this flawed bill,

12:08.937 --> 12:12.357
but Congress is a system
with a lot of moving parts,

12:12.482 --> 12:15.360
and that could lead to a lot of...

12:15.485 --> 12:17.195
unintended consequences.

12:17.320 --> 12:21.032
Well, I have a majority in the Senate,

12:21.158 --> 12:22.868
Second Amendment on my side.

12:22.993 --> 12:25.203
Seems pretty simple to me,
Madam Speaker.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.748
You know this bill doesn't threaten
the Second Amendment.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.543
And you may have the majority
in the Senate,

12:31.668 --> 12:36.047
but may I remind you that the country
recently elected a House

12:36.173 --> 12:38.800
that is almost a third Independent.

12:38.925 --> 12:44.556
Even if you succeed in killing this bill,
we have much bigger priorities:

12:44.681 --> 12:48.727
tax reform, trade agreements,
national security.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.897
If we want to get any of those things
done in this Congress,

12:52.022 --> 12:54.649
we need a united Republican front.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.360
You're not helping with this stunt.

13:01.865 --> 13:02.908
No, you're right.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.535
This is bigger than background checks.

13:05.660 --> 13:08.246
And I'm not interested
in a united front

13:08.371 --> 13:10.749
if it means
compromising my values.

13:10.874 --> 13:14.920
Now, I may be new to the Hill,
but so is everybody else.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.339
You're the last of the old guard
around here, Madam Speaker.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.049
So, uh...

13:19.174 --> 13:22.886
So get on board...
or step aside. Hmm?

13:23.720 --> 13:24.846
Thanks for the coffee.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.308
Ma'am.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.440
Republicans with moderate records,
minimal ties to the gun lobby,

13:35.565 --> 13:38.193
and enough time left on their terms
to ride out any backlash.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.529
Hmm, three steps ahead.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.948
I can't take all the credit.
Lege Affairs did the legwork.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.742
And humble, too.
You'll get over that.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.244
Walter Dunlap, I know him.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.954
We shared some classes together
at Cornell.

13:49.079 --> 13:51.081
He's a good guy,

13:51.206 --> 13:53.959
but I swear he cheated his way
through introductory physics.

13:54.084 --> 13:56.628
- I wouldn't bring that up.
- I'll set the meeting.

13:56.753 --> 13:57.963
Thank you.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.589
<i>Welcome to the White House.</i>

13:59.714 --> 14:01.925
I know I speak
on behalf of the President

14:02.050 --> 14:06.805
when I say thank you so much
for your courage and generosity

14:06.930 --> 14:08.723
in coming here
to share your stories today.

14:08.849 --> 14:11.893
Ma'am, will you be discussing SB8180?

14:12.018 --> 14:13.103
- Thank you, pool.
- Uh, no.

14:13.228 --> 14:14.771
Uh... today is about people,

14:14.896 --> 14:17.649
not politics, and I am here to listen.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.485
Okay, if everybody has what they need,
Jake here can escort you out.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.904
We'll let the First Lady get started.
Thank you, everybody.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.281
Thank you, Seth.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.169
You don't have an office anymore, either?

14:38.295 --> 14:41.172
I do, but that would require
getting you White House clearance,

14:41.298 --> 14:43.425
and that would require
a lot of explanation.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.510
Feel like going on a road trip?

14:45.635 --> 14:48.138
- Where are we heading?
- North Dakota.

14:48.638 --> 14:52.434
- What the hell is in North Dakota?
- Let's find out.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.608
Look, Leslie, I'm not interested
in playing this out publicly.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.694
I just need you to tell me which
Republicans would be open to a sit-down?

15:02.819 --> 15:05.030
The murder rate in particular cities
in this country

15:05.155 --> 15:06.865
is unacceptable to President Kirkman...

15:06.990 --> 15:09.951
Senator, I understand
and appreciate your position,

15:10.076 --> 15:12.203
but 84% of the country
wants tougher background checks.

15:12.329 --> 15:15.707
Now, the American people have spoken,
and it's our job to listen. Hey.

15:15.832 --> 15:16.791
Hey.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.836
I'm very sorry to hear you say that, sir.
Thank you. Goodbye.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.379
Who was that?

15:21.504 --> 15:24.174
Senator Franklin.
We're five Republican votes short.

15:24.299 --> 15:27.552
How are you doing?
Seth said the roundtable went well.

15:27.677 --> 15:28.762
Yeah.

15:29.846 --> 15:32.098
There was this one guy, Mike Dunne.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.392
Two years ago, his wife, Allison,

15:34.517 --> 15:36.353
she's driving back
from the grocery store,

15:36.478 --> 15:38.688
and she accidentally cut someone off.

15:38.813 --> 15:41.650
That man, he followed her
to the next red light...

15:42.692 --> 15:45.570
and he... shoots her dead.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.656
- My God.
- I know.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.867
Tom, we got so lucky when you were shot.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.370
I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.706
I know how lucky I am.

15:57.165 --> 16:01.711
You know, the strength of some of these
people after what they've been through...

16:03.713 --> 16:05.340
it's... it's inspiring.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.342
Come here.

16:08.051 --> 16:10.136
You've got to win this.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.851
- Banker's hours?
- Well, it's business.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.229
- Does that mean you're buying?
- Same thing?

16:19.354 --> 16:21.773
I left a bottle in the desk.
I assume you found it.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.566
Uh... I'm working my first
Congressional vote

16:23.692 --> 16:25.777
as chief of staff to the
President of the United States.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.278
That bottle is long gone, Aaron.

16:27.404 --> 16:28.238
Mm.

16:30.532 --> 16:32.951
- Speaking of the vote...
- Here you go.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.120
...I know you're gonna need
a few Republicans,

16:35.245 --> 16:37.372
and I know you're facing
an uphill climb.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.999
That's not exactly a secret.

16:40.166 --> 16:43.169
- What if we could help?
- Hookstraten?

16:43.753 --> 16:45.547
She's a Republican...

16:45.672 --> 16:47.590
- and she is Speaker.
- Of the House.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.801
How exactly is
she gonna line up senators?

16:49.926 --> 16:51.970
You know there's some soft spots
in the Senate;

16:52.095 --> 16:54.305
moderates who don't really
oppose background checks.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.224
They're just afraid to cross Bowman.

16:57.934 --> 16:58.893
I'm listening.

17:01.438 --> 17:05.316
If these senators can be reassured
there's a home for them in the party,

17:05.442 --> 17:07.609
someone has their back
come election time,

17:07.736 --> 17:10.155
they might have a reason
to vote the bill through.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.115
And what's in it for Hookstraten?

17:13.950 --> 17:15.410
Think about it.

17:18.121 --> 17:19.705
Vice President.

17:35.305 --> 17:38.183
- What do you think?
- Did you have this flown in from Ithaca?

17:38.308 --> 17:40.101
Secret Service wouldn't allow it.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.645
But someone down there in the kitchen
is working some serious magic

17:42.771 --> 17:45.190
'cause I'd swear this is a Pinesburger.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.108
Three more and you get a free t-shirt.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.027
The Pinesburger challenge.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.821
I think it would send me into
a cardiac arrest these days.

17:53.490 --> 17:56.993
30 years ago, when we were back
in Clark Hall,

17:57.118 --> 18:00.663
could you ever have imagined
that the two of us would be sitting here?

18:02.165 --> 18:04.042
Not in my wildest dreams.

18:06.336 --> 18:09.297
And it is an honor to be here,
Mr. President, truly.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.717
But you do know
I'm a Republican, right?

18:12.842 --> 18:15.220
I heard a rumor.

18:15.345 --> 18:19.390
Walter, I know you're a good man...
reasonable.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.017
Hell, there's more public support

18:21.142 --> 18:23.394
for background checks
than there is for tax cuts.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.481
I'm not so sure about Iowa.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.234
But that's not the point.
The language of this bill is so broad,

18:29.359 --> 18:32.862
- my people tell me it's a slippery slope.
- I know. I know.

18:33.696 --> 18:35.365
We're gonna fix it in the House.

18:35.490 --> 18:39.619
But I have to vote for the bill
as written, Tom. I can't do it.

18:40.537 --> 18:44.249
Look, I know we go back a long time,
and I may lean toward the center,

18:44.374 --> 18:46.501
but this is politics.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.169
I was appointed by a Republican governor,

18:48.294 --> 18:52.006
and I can't go rogue
on the first big vote of my term.

18:52.132 --> 18:55.426
Walter, we've got a chance
to do something really good here.

18:55.552 --> 18:57.387
This bill is gonna save lives.

18:58.388 --> 18:59.722
I'm sorry.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.310
Me, too.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.229
Me, too.

19:09.399 --> 19:12.068
<i>I brought this bill out of committee
to the Senate floor</i>

19:12.193 --> 19:13.778
<i>to show the White House</i>

19:13.903 --> 19:16.239
<i>that any effort to interfere
in the free exercise</i>

19:16.364 --> 19:18.783
<i>of Americans' Second Amendment
rights will fail.</i>

19:18.908 --> 19:22.412
<i>Senator, the First Lady hosted
a number of victims of gun violence</i>

19:22.537 --> 19:26.749
<i>- at the White House yesterday.
- Yeah, a blatant PR stunt.</i>

19:26.875 --> 19:30.461
<i>Listen, the White House has completely
oversimplified this issue.</i>

19:30.587 --> 19:32.964
<i>They're making promises
about safety they can't keep.</i>

19:33.089 --> 19:35.425
Mr. President...
Speaker Hookstraten.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.136
Thank you.

19:38.261 --> 19:41.306
- Kimble, how nice to see you.
- Thank you, sir.

19:41.431 --> 19:45.476
I know you've got a Senate vote coming up
fast, so I won't take much of your time.

19:45.602 --> 19:48.646
What I came to tell you is,
with the proper encouragement,

19:48.771 --> 19:52.775
I think a few moderate Republicans
in the Senate might just vote yes.

19:53.276 --> 19:55.153
What kind of encouragement
are we talking about?

19:55.278 --> 19:56.988
If the Senate gets the bill to the House,

19:57.113 --> 19:59.657
I will work with you
and other House leaders

19:59.782 --> 20:02.410
to get an amended measure passed,
as you intend.

20:02.535 --> 20:05.079
And I'm willing to say that publicly.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.624
That's very generous of you.

20:08.041 --> 20:11.794
And courageous, too, to take on
Senator Bowman like that.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.339
Kimble, I have to be honest,

20:14.464 --> 20:17.342
I'm not in a position
to make promises right now.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.428
Obviously, this bill
is incredibly important to me,

20:20.553 --> 20:22.597
but the best that I could do...

20:24.057 --> 20:26.768
Well, I would be very grateful
down the line.

20:28.144 --> 20:31.064
That's all I need to know, Mr. President.
Thank you.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.233
No, thank <i>you.</i>

20:33.942 --> 20:34.901
Kimble?

20:36.819 --> 20:38.363
From the moment I took office,

20:38.488 --> 20:41.324
I've been trying to guess
what you were going to do.

20:41.449 --> 20:44.702
And I have to admit,
I've usually been wrong.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.621
Why are you doing this?

20:47.288 --> 20:49.999
Because I think
you're doing the right thing, sir.

20:52.335 --> 20:53.586
Thank you very much.

21:00.343 --> 21:02.136
Today,
I had a very productive meeting

21:02.262 --> 21:05.390
with President Kirkman regarding SB8180.

21:05.515 --> 21:07.558
I agree with him that sensible measures

21:07.684 --> 21:09.727
to ensure gun safety are long overdue

21:09.852 --> 21:11.688
and that expanding background checks

21:11.813 --> 21:13.856
<i>makes Americans safer.</i>

21:13.982 --> 21:16.401
<i>So I urge my colleagues in the Senate</i>

21:16.526 --> 21:19.737
<i>to pass this bill tomorrow
and get it to the House,</i>

21:19.862 --> 21:22.991
<i>where Republicans, Democrats,
and Independents will work together...</i>

21:23.116 --> 21:25.535
I'd say your meeting
with the Speaker went well.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.329
Let's hope this works.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.331
<i>As the President has said,</i>

21:30.456 --> 21:33.918
<i>let's put country above party
and show the American people</i>

21:34.043 --> 21:36.212
<i>that their Congress is listening.</i>

21:47.473 --> 21:50.685
So, what do you think we're
really gonna find all the way out here?

21:51.978 --> 21:53.021
Oil?

21:53.146 --> 21:54.439
I don't know.

21:54.564 --> 21:58.401
Must be something big for
Brooke Mathison to come all this way.

21:58.526 --> 22:01.863
We're getting closer to the belly
of the beast, Jason, I can feel it.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.533
Pull over two miles out.
We'll go the rest of the way on foot.

22:06.326 --> 22:09.037
It's so crazy listening to you
give me orders.

22:09.162 --> 22:11.956
Seems like just yesterday,
it was the other way around.

22:12.081 --> 22:14.625
It's weird for me, too, you know.

22:14.751 --> 22:17.128
No, I mean it. I mean, I'm grateful.

22:17.253 --> 22:21.299
Because I tell you,
with Brooke Mathison being dead,

22:21.424 --> 22:22.633
I thought I'd have closure,

22:22.759 --> 22:25.136
but I realize that's not gonna happen

22:25.261 --> 22:27.889
until all these sons of bitches
are brought down.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.902
Mr. President, I have Senator Dunlap
on the phone for you.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.946
Thank you, Ava.

22:45.198 --> 22:47.075
Walter. How are you doing?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.618
I'm well, Mr. President.

22:48.743 --> 22:51.579
Just had a long talk
with Kimble Hookstraten about 8180.

22:52.246 --> 22:53.247
- And...?
<i>- And...</i>

22:53.373 --> 22:57.335
she's agreed to provide me with
the political cover I need to back you up

22:57.460 --> 22:58.586
<i>on this.</i>

22:58.711 --> 23:00.421
That's fantastic.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.840
<i>I'm sorry it had to play out
like this, Tom.</i>

23:02.965 --> 23:05.426
I wish I could have just said yes
when you asked me,

23:05.551 --> 23:07.470
but, anyway, I wanted you
to hear it from me.

23:07.595 --> 23:10.640
<i>- You can count on my vote.</i>
- I really appreciate it, Walter.

23:10.765 --> 23:13.351
- This is great news.
- Good day, Mr. President.

23:13.476 --> 23:14.811
<i>Good day.</i>

23:20.608 --> 23:21.526
Hey.

23:21.651 --> 23:25.363
Hey. Hookstraten got us
three Republicans:

23:25.488 --> 23:27.990
Kovich, Duffield, and Dunlap
flipped this morning.

23:28.116 --> 23:30.368
Okay, I never thought I'd use
"Hookstraten" and "friend"

23:30.493 --> 23:32.703
in the same sentence.
Is this, uh, Aaron's doing?

23:32.829 --> 23:34.455
Well, I mean,
he knows that we need

23:34.580 --> 23:37.041
to take down Jack Bowman
just as much as she does, so...

23:37.166 --> 23:39.669
Yeah, but for her to wrap
her arms around POTUS like that,

23:39.794 --> 23:41.337
there's got to be
something else going on.

23:41.796 --> 23:45.675
I'm just saying there may or may not be
a pool going in the lower press.

23:46.676 --> 23:50.012
- The President hasn't agreed to anything.
- Oh, okay.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.811
Thank you so much,
Senator, for seeing me.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.312
Thank you for reaching out.

23:58.438 --> 24:00.523
Well, I made a promise to Amara Qazi,

24:00.648 --> 24:02.567
and she came to the roundtable yesterday.

24:02.692 --> 24:07.071
Her 12-year-old grandson was killed
in a drive-by shooting in Chicago.

24:07.196 --> 24:08.698
- 12 years old...
- Yeah.

24:08.823 --> 24:11.242
Without a specific law
targeting gun trafficking,

24:11.367 --> 24:14.203
we're not giving law enforcement
a fighting chance

24:14.328 --> 24:17.498
to stop the flood of weapons
coming into cities like Chicago.

24:17.623 --> 24:20.877
You are preaching to the choir,
Mrs. Kirkman.

24:21.002 --> 24:23.421
You know, I championed
this effort in Massachusetts,

24:23.546 --> 24:25.756
and I would be glad
to lead the charge here,

24:25.882 --> 24:28.593
if and when we have the momentum.

24:28.718 --> 24:30.261
Of course.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.763
And in the meantime, let me say...

24:32.889 --> 24:35.224
I am glad to have a sister-in-arms

24:35.349 --> 24:37.101
- in the White House.
- Well, thank you.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.770
And thank you so much
for your support with this vote.

24:39.896 --> 24:44.233
I hope we'll all be celebrating tomorrow.
Goodbye.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.112
Uh, Mrs. Kirkman...

24:48.237 --> 24:50.198
I don't believe we formally met.
Jack Bowman.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.241
I think you're right.
It just feels like we have.

24:52.366 --> 24:54.535
Well, this is
Senator Underhill, of Oklahoma.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.413
- Pleasure.
- Senator Higuera, New Jersey.

24:57.538 --> 24:58.915
Nice to meet you.

24:59.040 --> 25:01.375
- And Senator Vandenberg, Tennessee.
- Hello.

25:02.084 --> 25:03.961
I must say,
I'm surprised to see you here.

25:04.086 --> 25:06.047
Is the First Lady
working Senators now?

25:06.172 --> 25:09.050
Oh, I'm not here for votes.
I was just here to keep a promise

25:09.175 --> 25:12.303
to a woman who lost her son
to gun violence.

25:12.428 --> 25:14.096
Well, I admire your civic spirit.

25:14.222 --> 25:17.642
Good luck in the vote today, Mrs. Kirkman,
to you and your husband.

25:17.767 --> 25:20.269
Thank you, but this isn't about luck.

25:20.394 --> 25:24.482
It shouldn't be good luck that keeps
people safe in a movie theater

25:24.607 --> 25:28.444
or a mall or a school.
This is about doing what's right,

25:28.569 --> 25:31.948
and I just hope that 51 senators
can feel the same way.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.451
It was an honor to meet all of you.

25:41.290 --> 25:42.917
Okay, so we need two more.

25:43.042 --> 25:46.337
I was speaking to Lege Affairs today,
and they said we can get Higuera

25:46.462 --> 25:47.838
if you're willing
to talk Medicaid reform.

25:47.964 --> 25:51.008
- Medicaid cuts, absolutely not.
- Okay.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.094
Then we're looking
at Harrington from Colorado.

25:53.219 --> 25:56.681
I know his Chief of Staff from when
I worked on the Hill, so I'll take him,

25:56.806 --> 25:58.641
and Jim O'Malley was
in your Treasury Department.

25:58.766 --> 26:01.185
- Do you think he's a possibility?
- I'll knock some sense into him.

26:01.310 --> 26:04.772
Good. Our longest shot is gonna be
Mary-Anne Louis from Alaska.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.691
She's got a moderate streak,
but it is Alaska.

26:06.816 --> 26:07.817
I'll talk to her.

26:07.942 --> 26:10.027
Well, let's just wait
on the big guns for a second

26:10.152 --> 26:13.030
because if we can get Harrington
and O'Malley, we have our 51.

26:13.155 --> 26:15.783
I smell the barn on this.
Good work, Ms. Rhodes.

26:15.908 --> 26:19.537
I appreciate that, sir, but our work
isn't done until we have the votes.

26:19.662 --> 26:21.330
We're gonna need to prepare a statement,

26:21.455 --> 26:22.790
- up or down.
- I'm on it.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.042
We just lost Engram.

26:25.167 --> 26:27.003
What? Engram's a Democrat.

26:27.128 --> 26:30.298
Says he doesn't like you aligning
yourself with a Republican speaker

26:30.423 --> 26:33.050
- he can't trust.
- Two steps forward, one step back.

26:33.175 --> 26:34.802
So now we're at 48.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.554
Unless you're willing
to talk about Medicaid.

26:36.679 --> 26:38.639
No, no, I meant what I said.

26:40.266 --> 26:43.728
We need all three: Harrington, O'Malley,
and Mary-Anne Louis.

26:43.853 --> 26:45.855
Time for the big guns.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.191
Son of a bitch.

27:06.042 --> 27:07.918
We should be coming up on it...

27:08.044 --> 27:09.503
Let me see.

27:13.007 --> 27:14.467
...right now.

27:15.718 --> 27:18.804
- What the hell?
- This is the place.

27:20.056 --> 27:22.058
But where's the facility?

27:40.242 --> 27:41.911
Good to see you haven't changed.

27:42.036 --> 27:44.413
Your office said you were on lunch.
I took a wild guess.

27:44.538 --> 27:46.791
If you wanted to hang out,
you could have just asked.

27:46.916 --> 27:48.417
I'm here for work, Grady.

27:48.542 --> 27:51.128
I need to know where
your boss stands on SB8180.

27:51.253 --> 27:54.465
Mm, that depends on how persuasive
the President is willing to get.

27:54.590 --> 27:55.883
Just give me a number.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.635
Mr. President,
I think what you're doing

27:57.760 --> 27:59.303
for this administration is admirable.

27:59.428 --> 28:04.475
But some of us still have elections
to worry about. In Texas.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.478
I carried Texas by 60 points
last time I ran.

28:07.603 --> 28:11.273
I'd say my endorsement still
carries some weight down there.

28:11.399 --> 28:12.775
Are you promising me
your endorsement?

28:13.776 --> 28:15.569
Prove you deserve it, Jim.

28:15.695 --> 28:18.447
Mr. President, you're asking me
to commit political suicide.

28:18.572 --> 28:20.825
No, I'm asking you to do the right thing.

28:20.950 --> 28:23.619
And sacrifice every other right thing
for this one.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.789
My appointment is up in November.

28:26.914 --> 28:30.000
If I vote for this bill, I won't stand
a chance at re-election.

28:30.126 --> 28:31.836
You want a number? Okay.

28:31.961 --> 28:36.132
The immediate infrastructure
needs of Colorado exceeds $785 million.

28:36.924 --> 28:38.592
That's a lot of infrastructure.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.511
You're asking what would help
Coloradans overlook

28:40.636 --> 28:43.472
their Republican Junior
Senator's vote for gun control.

28:43.597 --> 28:46.851
We're talking about background checks
for new sales. It's mild.

28:46.976 --> 28:50.146
Well, if you swing that in the budget,
I think I can swing Harrington.

28:50.271 --> 28:52.106
I'll confirm within the hour.

28:52.606 --> 28:55.276
If you can't find your spine on this...

28:55.401 --> 28:57.278
I may just run for the damn seat myself.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.780
There's no need to overreact.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.866
It's really that important to you?

29:01.991 --> 29:04.201
Oh, I'm not asking for myself.

29:04.326 --> 29:06.829
I'm not even asking
for the President.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.581
I'm asking for the country.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.126
And I'm not really asking.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.714
Look, I understand that
this is Washington, D.C.,

29:16.839 --> 29:18.841
and I understand
that you're a politician,

29:18.966 --> 29:21.719
but we have a chance to finally
move forward on this thing,

29:21.844 --> 29:23.471
maybe even save some lives.

29:25.681 --> 29:27.975
If this vote costs you your re-election,

29:28.100 --> 29:30.770
I guarantee you I will find you a place
in this administration.

29:33.522 --> 29:35.524
I have to think about it.

29:38.194 --> 29:39.278
Right.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.240
I know this is hard.

29:43.365 --> 29:45.993
It shouldn't be, but I know that it is.

29:46.118 --> 29:49.538
At the end of the day, all I can do
is ask you to vote your conscience.

29:56.378 --> 29:58.088
Well, it's gonna come down to the wire.

29:58.214 --> 29:59.924
- I did all I could.
- You opened the door.

30:00.049 --> 30:02.551
If this bill passes, it's probably
gonna be because of you,

30:02.676 --> 30:04.261
and the President knows that.

30:04.386 --> 30:06.013
And if it fails...

30:06.138 --> 30:09.350
Well, we thank the senators
who voted yes for their courage

30:09.475 --> 30:11.101
and vow to keep fighting for the issue.

30:11.227 --> 30:13.187
And then we don't talk
about it for a while.

30:14.647 --> 30:16.857
This was the President's cause,

30:16.982 --> 30:20.110
and if it goes down...
let it be his defeat.

30:20.236 --> 30:22.571
Well, what about the vice presidency?

30:23.197 --> 30:25.574
I have no intention of tying myself
to a lame duck.

30:27.076 --> 30:31.539
Look, Aaron...
I respect your loyalty to the President.

30:31.664 --> 30:34.792
The vice presidency was a conversation,
not a blood oath.

30:34.917 --> 30:36.919
And if Kirkman loses...

30:37.044 --> 30:39.213
we're gonna have to do
our own damage control.

30:43.759 --> 30:45.719
Hey, we have a flag.

30:45.845 --> 30:48.430
Did you know the First Lady was
at Dirksen today?

30:48.556 --> 30:49.473
What?

30:49.598 --> 30:51.976
Yeah, meeting with Senator Hunter about
some federal gun-trafficking legislation.

30:52.101 --> 30:55.646
I know she told me she wanted to talk to
her, but I didn't think that meant today.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.314
Hours before the vote, Emily.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.942
- And she ran into Jack Bowman.
- Oh, my God.

31:00.067 --> 31:01.110
They exchanged words.

31:01.235 --> 31:03.737
I got this from someone in my office
who got it from someone on the Hill.

31:04.780 --> 31:05.948
Does the President know?

31:06.073 --> 31:07.825
- No, not yet.
- Okay.

31:07.950 --> 31:09.577
We can't tell him. It's not our place.

31:09.702 --> 31:10.911
Emily, you're the Chief of Staff.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.580
- She's the First Lady.
- He should know.

31:12.705 --> 31:14.248
Could you imagine
if there'd been cameras there?

31:14.373 --> 31:16.000
But there weren't, were there?

31:16.125 --> 31:18.002
I haven't heard anything,
so whatever she did, it's done.

31:18.127 --> 31:21.422
We will quietly re-confirm the votes
and hope there's no damage.

31:28.888 --> 31:31.015
I'm telling you, Foerstel,
there was nothing there.

31:31.140 --> 31:32.850
<i>I just sent you something.</i>

31:32.975 --> 31:35.019
<i>Infrared's got a hit
at those coordinates.</i>

31:35.144 --> 31:37.605
You didn't happen to look down, did you?

31:37.730 --> 31:39.189
What, we were standing on it?

31:39.315 --> 31:42.026
- What's underground?
- It's an ICBM missile silo.

31:42.151 --> 31:45.321
<i>- What?</i>
- The government built it in the '70s,

31:45.446 --> 31:48.657
<i>decommissioned years ago
as part of an arms reduction treaty.</i>

31:48.991 --> 31:52.661
<i>Took out the payload, and the property
was sold to Browning-Reed.</i>

31:53.329 --> 31:56.290
- We got to get back out there and find it.
- No.

31:56.832 --> 31:59.209
The sun's about to set.

31:59.335 --> 32:01.211
We're not gonna find anything
in the dark.

32:01.337 --> 32:04.214
All right, then we sleep here.
We head out at first light.

32:08.010 --> 32:10.971
Just got word from Moss.
O'Malley's in.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.015
I think it's gonna come down
to Mary-Anne Louis.

32:13.140 --> 32:16.310
Yes, sir. If she votes for the bill,
we have the majority.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.812
- If she doesn't...
- It's a tie.

32:18.938 --> 32:21.565
And with no VP to break it,
the bill fails.

32:21.690 --> 32:23.400
Drafts of your remarks on the vote, sir.

32:23.525 --> 32:25.110
Thank you.

32:27.154 --> 32:32.076
The Senate will come
to order for the vote on SB8180.

32:32.201 --> 32:36.038
This bill requires 51 votes for passage.

32:37.164 --> 32:38.207
Mr. Andover.

32:39.959 --> 32:40.960
Aye.

32:41.669 --> 32:42.920
<i>Ms. Azora.</i>

32:43.045 --> 32:44.004
<i>No.</i>

32:45.714 --> 32:46.840
Mr. Bowman.

32:48.050 --> 32:49.009
No.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.260
No surprise there.

32:50.386 --> 32:51.720
<i>Ms. Correia.</i>

32:51.845 --> 32:53.389
<i>No.</i>

32:54.807 --> 32:56.350
<i>Mr. Dunlap.</i>

32:56.892 --> 32:57.893
Aye.

32:58.394 --> 33:00.938
<i>- Senator Engram.
- No.</i>

33:01.063 --> 33:03.732
<i>- Senator...</i>
- Feels like a funeral in here.

33:05.067 --> 33:08.404
It's like none of you have been
through a vote before. Come on!

33:08.529 --> 33:12.282
- You haven't lost yet.
- God, this job is making me fat.

33:12.408 --> 33:14.076
- Diet starts tomorrow.
- Yep.

33:14.201 --> 33:15.202
I'm good. Thank you.

33:15.327 --> 33:16.745
<i>- Senator Heldreth.</i>
- Thanks, sir.

33:16.870 --> 33:18.163
<i>No.</i>

33:18.497 --> 33:19.790
Ms. Higuera.

33:19.915 --> 33:21.208
No.

33:23.043 --> 33:24.211
Ms. Hunter.

33:24.712 --> 33:25.546
Aye.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.631
- Heard about the pizza.
- Hey.

33:27.756 --> 33:28.716
<i>Ms. Louis.</i>

33:28.841 --> 33:30.259
Senator Louis is next.

33:35.264 --> 33:36.432
Ms. Louis?

33:39.101 --> 33:40.269
No.

33:40.853 --> 33:42.479
Damn it.

33:42.604 --> 33:45.274
- What's happened?
- She didn't have the guts.

33:45.399 --> 33:48.110
- It's gonna be a tie.
- Which means we lose.

33:57.953 --> 33:59.288
Mr. O'Malley.

33:59.413 --> 34:00.789
Aye.

34:01.123 --> 34:03.333
- Mr. Schiller.
- Aye.

34:03.459 --> 34:05.335
- Mr. Underhill.
<i>- No.</i>

34:05.461 --> 34:08.297
Well, it was a hell of a lot closer
than I expected.

34:08.422 --> 34:09.922
<i>- Ms. Vandenberg.</i>
- Tom, I'm so sorry.

34:10.049 --> 34:14.094
I'm sorry, too. It was my job
to deliver, and I didn't.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.971
It was nobody's fault. We all tried.

34:16.096 --> 34:17.681
- Wait, wait, wait!
- What?

34:17.806 --> 34:19.016
Vandenberg voted yes.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.435
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, go back. Rewind it.

34:23.896 --> 34:25.647
<i>Ms. Vandenberg.</i>

34:29.150 --> 34:30.985
<i>Ms. Vandenberg?</i>

34:32.321 --> 34:33.197
Aye.

34:33.322 --> 34:34.697
Vandenberg? I know her.

34:34.822 --> 34:38.534
She was appointed to fill
her husband's seat from Tennessee.

34:38.659 --> 34:40.329
He was as red as they come.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.835
Richard Vandenberg voted
against every gun measure

34:47.960 --> 34:50.630
that came up during his time in
the Senate. I assumed she would too.

34:50.755 --> 34:54.134
I guess everybody did.
Good for you.

34:56.678 --> 34:59.848
<i>- Ms. Winston.
- No.</i>

34:59.973 --> 35:02.309
<i>And finally, Mr. Zwick.</i>

35:04.853 --> 35:06.021
Come on.

35:07.523 --> 35:08.690
Aye.

35:08.816 --> 35:11.318
On this vote, the yeas are 51,

35:12.152 --> 35:13.570
<i>and the nays are 49.</i>

35:13.695 --> 35:14.738
- It passes!
- Hey!

35:14.863 --> 35:15.739
We won!

35:15.864 --> 35:18.700
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations to you!

35:18.826 --> 35:20.661
Great work, everyone.
This is unbelievable.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.580
- Where's the champagne?
- I have some Macallan in my office.

35:23.705 --> 35:25.791
Well, let's get it! This is a celebration!

35:34.883 --> 35:36.885
- I want to meet Senator Vandenberg.
- Yes, sir.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.517
Emily, we did it.

35:44.226 --> 35:46.395
We did.

35:47.146 --> 35:50.858
- To the first of many wins.
- Never in doubt.

35:53.569 --> 35:56.738
<i>In a tight contest that
riveted and surprised</i>

35:56.864 --> 35:59.950
<i>Washington pundits, the Senate voted
51 to 49 last night</i>

36:00.075 --> 36:02.452
<i>in favor of a bill expanding
background checks</i>

36:02.578 --> 36:04.788
<i>for gun purchases across the country.</i>

36:04.913 --> 36:06.415
<i>The bill now moves to the House,</i>

36:06.540 --> 36:09.793
<i>where Speaker Kimble Hookstraten
has promised a bipartisan effort</i>

36:09.918 --> 36:12.296
<i>to amend the legislation
and get it passed.</i>

36:12.421 --> 36:16.258
<i>Hookstraten's support is a promising
sign for the Independent President</i>

36:16.383 --> 36:18.886
<i>as he rolls out
his hundred days agenda.</i>

36:36.612 --> 36:38.739
It's supposed to be right here.

36:39.615 --> 36:41.074
This is crazy.

36:43.577 --> 36:44.578
Wells.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.631
Stand back.

37:01.595 --> 37:03.222
You ready?

37:03.764 --> 37:06.141
Yeah. What could go wrong?

37:27.663 --> 37:29.873
- Hey.
<i>- Congratulations.</i>

37:29.998 --> 37:32.209
They're calling it a big win
for the President.

37:32.334 --> 37:33.210
<i>And for the Speaker.</i>

37:33.335 --> 37:35.045
She took a big risk, and it paid off.

37:35.170 --> 37:36.880
Yeah, well, we're not feeling
so bad about it.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.465
We'll have to do it again sometime.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.759
- Sounds like we will be.
- Looking forward to it.

37:44.805 --> 37:47.516
- Senator Vandenberg, sir.
- Thank you, Lily.

37:47.641 --> 37:50.060
Senator, it is an honor to meet you.

37:50.185 --> 37:52.354
This is my wife, Alex.
I believe you've met.

37:52.479 --> 37:54.022
Briefly, yes.

37:54.147 --> 37:55.524
Please, please, sit.

37:56.441 --> 37:59.236
Mr. President,
thank you for the invitation.

37:59.361 --> 38:02.572
And, Mrs. Kirkman, thank you
for agreeing to be here.

38:02.698 --> 38:03.991
Of course.

38:04.116 --> 38:06.576
I want to thank you
for what you did last night.

38:06.702 --> 38:09.579
Do you mind if I ask,
what made you change your mind?

38:09.705 --> 38:10.789
Change it?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.417
Well, I... I guess we all assumed

38:13.542 --> 38:15.836
that you would vote
the way your husband would have,

38:15.961 --> 38:18.380
especially Senator Bowman.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.841
Well, he never asked.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.593
I think he just assumed I felt lucky
to be there.

38:23.719 --> 38:26.722
We were lucky that you were.

38:27.723 --> 38:31.351
Richard and I had a happy marriage,
but we didn't agree on everything.

38:32.227 --> 38:34.980
Guns were one of those things.

38:35.355 --> 38:39.735
I heard what you said about country
over party, Mr. President.

38:39.860 --> 38:41.737
I took it to heart.

38:42.654 --> 38:47.159
And when I saw you stand up to Senator
Bowman yesterday, Mrs. Kirkman...

38:47.701 --> 38:50.370
it reminded me that I could, too.

38:51.371 --> 38:54.374
I'm sure I'll take flack for it,
but I won't give in,

38:54.499 --> 38:56.460
and you shouldn't, either.

38:56.585 --> 38:58.253
Keep doing what you're doing.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.591
I promise you we will.

39:27.783 --> 39:30.327
This place is like
a Cold War time capsule.

39:30.452 --> 39:31.787
Whoa.

39:50.097 --> 39:51.431
Whoa.

40:34.266 --> 40:35.350
Jason.

40:37.853 --> 40:39.729
Good God.

40:39.855 --> 40:42.607
These look like the bombs
used to blow up the Capitol.

40:51.283 --> 40:54.327
There's enough explosives in here
to blow up three Capitols.
