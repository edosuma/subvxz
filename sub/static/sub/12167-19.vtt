00:01.506 --> 00:03.717
<i>(Teyla) Previously on Stargate Atlantis...</i>

00:03.883 --> 00:06.219
The last line of defence before Atlantis.

00:06.386 --> 00:10.557
- Knocked out in the Ancients' last stand?
- Its power source is depleted.

00:10.724 --> 00:14.811
There's an unidentified craft the size
of a Wraith dart heading for the city.

00:14.978 --> 00:16.354
It's scanning us.

00:16.521 --> 00:18.940
- What are those?
- Wraith hive ships.

00:19.107 --> 00:22.444
If they maintain speed,
they'll be over our planet in two weeks.

00:24.112 --> 00:27.991
The Wraith were conducting experiments
on your ancestors.

00:28.158 --> 00:31.327
- You have some Wraith DNA.
- She can see what's happening.

00:31.494 --> 00:34.581
I am on a ship.
I am in some sort of control room.

00:34.748 --> 00:38.918
- You are all so pathetic.
- That's not Teyla talking.

00:39.085 --> 00:42.339
Chances are Teyla gave away
our location to the Wraith.

00:42.505 --> 00:46.092
Atlantis is the only way
to get to a new, rich feeding ground.

00:46.259 --> 00:47.886
Earth.

01:00.357 --> 01:04.903
Teyla has ascertained that the Wraith
are more interested in Earth than Atlantis,

01:05.069 --> 01:07.989
which is, you know, terrifying.

01:08.156 --> 01:12.952
She realised the hive ships will go
right past the only surviving satellite.

01:13.119 --> 01:16.706
The last of what we assume
were dozens of defence satellites,

01:16.873 --> 01:19.709
destroyed during the Ancients' last stand.

01:19.876 --> 01:22.712
Yes. We think we can use it
to our advantage.

01:22.879 --> 01:26.841
- She said it was dead.
- It is, but we think we can bring it back.

01:27.008 --> 01:29.719
If we are right about what is wrong with it.

01:29.886 --> 01:32.639
Yes, if we're right
about what's wrong with it.

01:32.806 --> 01:37.560
But if we're right and it's just out of power,
the Wraith have been ignoring it.

01:37.727 --> 01:43.108
Estimates indicate a single naqahdah
generator could bring it back online.

01:43.274 --> 01:46.319
Why can't generators
get our weapon systems working?

01:46.486 --> 01:50.448
Because they were designed
to be powered by the zero-point module.

01:50.615 --> 01:54.619
- The satellite isn't.
- It could take out a Wraith hive ship?

01:54.786 --> 01:57.831
It should be able
to take out all three when charged.

01:57.997 --> 02:00.458
Ancient technology was far superior.

02:00.625 --> 02:02.877
They lost the war
because they were outnumbered.

02:03.044 --> 02:06.214
- We're outnumbered.
- And outgunned.

02:06.381 --> 02:09.675
But they don't see the satellite.
Our strength.

02:09.842 --> 02:16.433
In military parlance,
surprise is an element on our side.

02:17.475 --> 02:21.980
- What do you need?
- The satellite's 15 hours away by jumper.

02:22.147 --> 02:26.776
We should put together a small crew,
say myself, Grodin and a pilot.

02:26.943 --> 02:29.029
- I'll go.
- Miller can handle it.

02:29.195 --> 02:34.075
I need you to keep searching for
alternate Alpha sites just in case this fails.

02:34.242 --> 02:38.538
The hive ships will be
in range of the satellite in 49 hours.

02:38.705 --> 02:41.041
We'll need every last second
of that time.

02:41.207 --> 02:42.959
Questions?

02:46.129 --> 02:48.173
OK, let's get on it.

02:48.340 --> 02:52.844
Well, Rodney, I don't mean
to put any undue pressure,

02:53.011 --> 02:59.267
but right now that satellite is the only thing
standing between the Wraith and Atlantis.

03:01.603 --> 03:04.147
No undue pressure.

04:12.632 --> 04:16.428
- I am fine.
- I wanted something more enthusiastic.

04:16.594 --> 04:20.473
- I'm ready to be put back on active duty.
- I'm sure you think so...

04:20.640 --> 04:25.103
- Tell him I'm fine.
- She is. No reason to keep her here.

04:28.940 --> 04:31.860
All right. You're back on active duty.

04:41.161 --> 04:44.998
I think I can handle this alone, Radek.
Can't you do anything else?

04:45.165 --> 04:47.625
- I think I should go.
- Yes, I agree. Go.

04:47.792 --> 04:50.503
- I mean on the mission.
- Why?

04:50.670 --> 04:53.882
- You know more about the satellite...
- You've noticed?

04:54.049 --> 04:57.385
...but a lot more about the city than me.
- I see.

04:57.552 --> 05:01.848
For whatever reason there is
problem there, it should be me, not you.

05:02.015 --> 05:04.934
- There won't be a problem.
- You don't know that.

05:05.101 --> 05:08.605
If it seems like we can't fix it,
we'll just come back.

05:08.772 --> 05:12.567
- I realise I am invaluable everywhere...
- I take it back.

05:12.734 --> 05:16.029
You can't. You've just admitted
I'm smarter than you are.

05:16.196 --> 05:20.784
- I admitted no such thing.
- The truth shone through and you spoke.

05:20.950 --> 05:26.498
- You are a miserable little man.
- Let's not ruin the moment here.

05:31.294 --> 05:35.757
Now... keep an eye on my city for me
when I'm gone, hm?

05:37.175 --> 05:39.594
- Good luck.
- Right.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.806
Right.

05:46.101 --> 05:48.395
MA5-393?

05:48.561 --> 05:52.982
No. We've only been there at night.
It gets ridiculously hot during the day.

05:53.149 --> 05:55.235
Not really an option.

05:55.402 --> 05:59.239
The damn Alpha site we picked
had to be marked by the Wraith.

05:59.406 --> 06:02.909
- They're a real pain in the ass.
- Yes, they are.

06:03.076 --> 06:07.122
- How about M4H-212?
- Crawling with Genii spies.

06:07.288 --> 06:10.834
You know that for a fact
or is your Spidey Sense just tingling?

06:11.001 --> 06:13.086
It's a fact, sir.

06:13.253 --> 06:16.464
Here we go. M1 M-316.

06:16.631 --> 06:18.800
Stackhouse reported lush surroundings,

06:18.967 --> 06:22.887
and as far as his team could tell,
it seemed uninhabited.

06:23.054 --> 06:27.267
- I'll get my team and check it out.
- Good. Remember, we don't need ideal.

06:27.434 --> 06:30.228
- We'd all settle for close.
- I'm on it.

06:36.860 --> 06:41.906
- Major, is Teyla coming with you?
- You're not seriously asking me that?

06:42.073 --> 06:45.118
- That's a bad call, sir.
- Here we go again.

06:45.285 --> 06:48.038
We don't fully understand
her Wraith connection.

06:48.204 --> 06:51.833
I don't think we should expose her
to secret information,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.294
especially the location of our evac site.

06:54.461 --> 06:58.298
- She has a clean bill of health.
- Good. But if she can't control...

06:58.465 --> 07:00.633
- You don't know that.
- That's right.

07:00.800 --> 07:05.472
She saw everything they saw. They could
do the same with her, see what we see.

07:05.638 --> 07:08.308
- If she's been compromised...
- She's in my team.

07:08.475 --> 07:12.562
Period. End of story. We're done.

07:17.859 --> 07:20.528
<i>(Zelenka) This is a simulation
I've put together.</i>

07:20.695 --> 07:25.116
It shows how the city will be destroyed
once we trigger the self-destruct.

07:41.257 --> 07:43.760
I'm so glad you felt I needed to see this.

07:43.927 --> 07:47.347
My nightmares are gonna be more vivid.

07:49.391 --> 07:52.602
- It's not going to be enough.
- What?

07:52.769 --> 07:56.606
The self-destruct plan.
It's nowhere near effective enough.

07:58.733 --> 08:00.902
That seemed pretty effective to me.

08:01.069 --> 08:04.989
Atlantis is more than a city.
It is an intergalactic spacecraft.

08:05.156 --> 08:08.660
Teyla said the Wraith are not interested
in destroying Atlantis.

08:08.827 --> 08:13.331
They're coming here to get to Earth.
They have to go through the Stargate...

08:13.498 --> 08:16.710
Which means stealing the city,
so we self-destruct.

08:16.876 --> 08:20.755
Yes, but if they are even
the least bit resourceful,

08:20.922 --> 08:23.299
which I must assume that they are,

08:23.466 --> 08:28.972
they can reverse-engineer their own
intergalactic engine from the wreckage.

08:29.139 --> 08:31.641
We need to break into smaller pieces?

08:31.808 --> 08:34.269
Yes, well, that would certainly help.

08:34.436 --> 08:36.604
I'm concerned
about the Ancient database.

08:36.770 --> 08:41.234
Its ability to back up data
is incredibly redundant.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.571
- Incredibly redundant?
- That will never get solved.

08:44.738 --> 08:48.992
If the Wraith recover even a small spot
of the Ancient database...

08:51.453 --> 08:53.621
That is my concern, exactly.

08:55.081 --> 08:59.127
How hard would it be
to destroy all the database terminals?

08:59.294 --> 09:01.588
Impossibly hard.

09:01.755 --> 09:06.718
We need to figure out a way
to delete the Ancient database.

09:06.885 --> 09:10.263
- Can you do that?
- We can find out.

09:10.430 --> 09:13.600
OK, find out,
but before you wipe anything out...

09:13.767 --> 09:16.853
<i>- (man) Dr Weir.
- Yes?</i>

09:17.020 --> 09:20.690
<i>Unscheduled off-world activation.
Major Sheppard is coming in hot.</i>

09:25.737 --> 09:29.366
- What's going on?
- They ran into resistance. I think Wraith.

09:29.532 --> 09:32.535
- You said this planet was uninhabited.
- It was.

09:38.708 --> 09:41.294
I told you she was a liability, sir.

09:41.461 --> 09:44.714
I won't let your feelings
endanger this facility any longer.

09:44.881 --> 09:46.257
What?

09:46.424 --> 09:49.969
The Wraith must be getting information
from you.

09:50.136 --> 09:53.431
What? We ran into a... What was that?

09:53.598 --> 09:56.851
- It looked like a T-Rex.
- Yeah, it wasn't even a Wraith.

09:57.018 --> 09:59.145
So check those accusations.

09:59.312 --> 10:01.898
You don't recommend the planet
as an Alpha site?

10:02.065 --> 10:08.196
Not my first choice. If McKay doesn't
get the satellite online, we're screwed.

10:12.075 --> 10:15.286
Dr Weir, this is Miller.
We're approaching the satellite.

10:16.663 --> 10:20.917
You're on the other side
of the solar system. Be careful out there.

10:21.084 --> 10:23.169
Understood.

10:29.050 --> 10:31.678
OK, close the bulkhead doors.

10:31.845 --> 10:33.930
- Good luck.
- Right.

10:34.097 --> 10:36.182
Good luck.

10:50.613 --> 10:54.701
- Sergeant Bates.
- What is it?

10:54.868 --> 10:57.203
You accused me
of disclosing our position.

10:57.370 --> 10:58.747
Yes, I did.

10:58.913 --> 11:01.958
- Clearly you were wrong.
- That's yet to be determined.

11:02.125 --> 11:04.002
- Excuse me?
- Look.

11:04.169 --> 11:07.547
You may not be in control
of what information you give away,

11:07.714 --> 11:12.385
but you should not be allowed to move
freely around this base of operations.

11:12.552 --> 11:18.767
Being accused of serving the Wraith
is the greatest insult among my people.

11:18.933 --> 11:22.312
- I am aware.
- What the hell's going on here?

11:23.480 --> 11:25.982
- I was stating an opinion.
- She attacked me.

11:26.149 --> 11:28.026
- For good reason.
- What reason?

11:28.193 --> 11:30.612
- My guess would be the Wraith.
- Walk away.

11:30.779 --> 11:33.531
- Sir!
- Walk away.

11:34.866 --> 11:38.286
- This isn't over.
- I would be disappointed if it were.

11:38.453 --> 11:42.874
What the hell are you doing?
You don't deck the head of security.

11:43.041 --> 11:45.210
- He said...
- I don't care what he said.

11:45.377 --> 11:47.504
He says a lot of things.

11:47.671 --> 11:50.507
You just stay away from him.

12:19.703 --> 12:21.788
<i>(heavy breathing)</i>

12:33.008 --> 12:36.428
<i>- (Grodin) Are you OK?
- Yes. Why?</i>

12:36.594 --> 12:38.680
You're breathing pretty heavily.

12:38.847 --> 12:41.349
<i>I'm feeling a little claustrophobic.</i>

12:42.392 --> 12:45.353
- How much air do these things hold?
- Eight hours.

12:45.520 --> 12:49.691
That's enough, right?
I mean, even with heavy breathing?

12:49.858 --> 12:53.403
<i>- They calculate that in, right?
- You're going to be fine.</i>

12:53.570 --> 12:57.032
You don't have an eight-hour ceiling
on your breathing.

13:40.408 --> 13:43.495
- It's completely dead.
- We thought as much.

13:43.662 --> 13:49.042
I'm gonna hook up the naqahdah
generator, get some life support going.

14:13.817 --> 14:16.653
- Halling, hello.
- May we speak?

14:16.820 --> 14:19.489
Please, have a seat.

14:21.700 --> 14:25.495
- How is the evacuation on the mainland?
- We'll be ready.

14:25.662 --> 14:28.373
Good.

14:28.540 --> 14:33.420
Dr Weir, what is there as a plan in place

14:33.586 --> 14:36.006
to destroy Atlantis?

14:38.925 --> 14:44.180
The Wraith will be able to make it to Earth
if the city is left intact.

14:44.347 --> 14:49.060
But I assure you that plan will only
be executed in a worst-case scenario.

14:49.227 --> 14:53.773
Such as three hive ships
flying towards Atlantis?

14:53.940 --> 14:56.901
We believe we can destroy them
before they arrive.

14:57.068 --> 15:01.614
I understand you fearing
for the well-being of your people.

15:01.781 --> 15:05.744
But it is not reason to destroy
the city of the Ancestors.

15:05.910 --> 15:11.791
Atlantis is a sacred place. To consider
destroying it merely for self-preservation...

15:11.958 --> 15:15.462
- Merely for self-preservation?
- This place is all that remains

15:15.628 --> 15:18.381
of the greatest race
ever to inhabit the stars.

15:18.548 --> 15:21.551
You would prefer it fell
into the hands of the Wraith?

15:21.718 --> 15:25.388
I would have faith that the Ancestors
would not allow it to happen.

15:25.555 --> 15:29.601
They have been able
to preserve Atlantis for 10,000 years.

15:29.768 --> 15:33.396
- Is it not possible...
- No, I don't think it is possible.

15:33.563 --> 15:37.734
Not if you're suggesting the Ancients
will return in time to save their city.

15:37.901 --> 15:40.820
You cannot know their plans for Atlantis.

15:40.987 --> 15:45.200
They have made all the plans
they are going to make.

15:45.367 --> 15:47.452
Now it's up to us.

15:48.328 --> 15:50.872
I thank you for your thoughts, Halling,

15:51.039 --> 15:55.543
but I have to do everything I can to make
sure the power and technology of Atlantis

15:55.710 --> 15:58.546
does not fall into the hands of the Wraith.

15:58.713 --> 16:02.050
And yes, to ensure
they never make it to my galaxy.

16:03.635 --> 16:08.181
Even if it means
sacrificing the future of this one?

16:18.400 --> 16:23.363
The idea is simple enough. The execution
is proving to be very difficult.

16:23.530 --> 16:27.033
- You're creating a virus?
- Yes. A plain old computer virus.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.662
Once introduced into the system,
wipe the database clean.

16:30.829 --> 16:34.290
It could be downloaded
as part of the self-destruct countdown.

16:34.457 --> 16:38.628
Might even affect the Wraith's systems
if they try to access it.

16:40.839 --> 16:42.924
How much of it could we save?

16:43.091 --> 16:45.552
- I'm sorry?
- Of the database.

16:45.719 --> 16:49.055
We brought a lot of hard drives.
How much can we transfer?

16:49.222 --> 16:53.977
- You mean back it up? Take a copy?
- Yes, exactly.

16:56.104 --> 17:01.026
Using McKay's compression codex,
I'd say maybe seven or eight per cent.

17:02.068 --> 17:04.529
- That's it?
- Yes.

17:14.289 --> 17:16.665
Here we go.

17:24.758 --> 17:27.301
Primary power online.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.480
Looks like life support's
now at 100 per cent.

17:39.230 --> 17:42.108
I think I found the switch
to initialise the gravity.

17:42.275 --> 17:44.986
Great. Just give me a second to... Whoa!

17:46.196 --> 17:49.616
<i>(groans) Oh, yeah.</i>

17:49.783 --> 17:53.453
Yeah, that's permanent back damage.

17:53.620 --> 17:56.623
Sorry, I assumed
it would come on more slowly.

17:56.790 --> 17:59.501
Well, you assumed with my life.

17:59.668 --> 18:03.546
- You'll be fine. It was just a little bump.
- What you got?

18:06.216 --> 18:09.469
<i>- (beeping)
- Looks like every system is back online.</i>

18:10.679 --> 18:13.431
- Except for the weapon.
- Oh, details.

18:13.598 --> 18:16.059
Here... let's get to work.

18:18.687 --> 18:20.772
Oh, thank you.

18:22.607 --> 18:25.151
Thank you.

18:25.318 --> 18:29.698
<i>(groans) Yeah. That's vertebra damage.</i>

18:29.864 --> 18:33.201
That's a life of pain.

18:34.285 --> 18:36.371
<i>(Sheppard) What about M1 K-439?</i>

18:36.538 --> 18:40.208
- Which one's that?
- The one with all the waterfalls.

18:40.375 --> 18:45.338
Waterfalls. Why don't we just
call it Planet Waterfall?

18:45.505 --> 18:48.258
What? I say we should
just give them names.

18:50.593 --> 18:52.929
We got a list of five planets here.

18:53.096 --> 18:56.349
That should be enough
potential Alpha sites.

18:56.516 --> 19:00.687
<i>(man) Major Sheppard, we have
a situation at Generator Station One.</i>

19:05.066 --> 19:09.195
- What's the problem?
- It's Bates, sir. He's been attacked.

19:09.362 --> 19:11.990
Get a medical team down here.

19:24.419 --> 19:28.089
- Is he gonna be OK?
- It's still hard to tell.

19:28.256 --> 19:32.177
He's got five broken ribs, a fractured
collarbone and severe concussion.

19:32.344 --> 19:34.429
- When can we talk to him?
- We can't.

19:34.596 --> 19:38.641
I put him in a coma until the subdural
haematoma can be dealt with.

19:38.808 --> 19:41.353
We won't find out
what happened from him yet.

19:41.519 --> 19:44.189
Teyla and Bates got into it
pretty bad yesterday.

19:44.356 --> 19:47.067
Fist-fighting and this
are a long drive apart.

19:47.233 --> 19:51.654
I understand, but they were in a fight
and both looking to continue it.

19:51.821 --> 19:57.452
- Anything pointing to who did this?
- I'm having a forensic exam performed.

19:57.619 --> 20:01.790
Let us know what you find out.
Let's go get her side of the story.

20:12.634 --> 20:17.972
It's not a power generation problem. The
naqahdah's pumping out enough juice.

20:18.139 --> 20:20.433
Then why isn't it...?

20:20.600 --> 20:23.770
OK. All right.

20:23.937 --> 20:27.691
Let's just step back here, think about it.

20:27.857 --> 20:31.194
This baby is
a directed energy-beam weapon.

20:31.361 --> 20:34.531
Runs off a relatively low-yield charge
like our generator.

20:34.698 --> 20:38.910
It's got to be continually building up
a charge with a buffer or a capacitor

20:39.077 --> 20:40.620
until it's discharged.

20:40.787 --> 20:43.623
I think I've found something. I like that.

20:47.502 --> 20:51.172
Yes, here it is.
Right now the buffer's at 90 per cent.

20:51.339 --> 20:55.593
OK. So power's getting to the buffer
but not to the actual weapon.

20:55.760 --> 21:00.140
Let me try and find a diagnostics program.
There must be one here.

21:00.306 --> 21:04.602
We got 29 hours till show time,
so let's hope we don't have to order parts.

21:07.772 --> 21:10.275
You do not think
I had anything to do with it?

21:10.442 --> 21:13.111
- Of course not.
- You and Bates did get into it.

21:13.278 --> 21:15.947
You know me.
I never would have taken it that far.

21:16.114 --> 21:18.992
I know. Let's see
if we can't rule it out altogether.

21:24.706 --> 21:27.876
- Where were you last night?
- I was here, in my room.

21:28.043 --> 21:29.919
- The whole night?
- Yes.

21:30.086 --> 21:32.380
We don't know if you blacked out.

21:32.547 --> 21:34.632
I have no way of proving it, no.

21:34.799 --> 21:37.677
But I did not leave this room last night,
I am sure.

21:42.474 --> 21:45.518
I did not leave this room.

21:46.644 --> 21:48.521
You asked to see me?

21:48.688 --> 21:52.567
We have found a suitable Alpha site
so we'll be able to evacuate.

21:52.734 --> 21:56.321
- That's good.
- That's not why I wanted to see you.

21:56.488 --> 21:59.866
You have to get me more than
eight per cent of the database.

22:00.033 --> 22:02.952
- There has got to be a way.
- Maybe nine per cent.

22:03.119 --> 22:06.247
How do I choose
between zero-point module research

22:06.414 --> 22:08.667
and their work on ascension?

22:08.833 --> 22:12.545
Between weapon schematics
and their notes on space travel?

22:12.712 --> 22:16.007
Invaluable information's gonna be lost

22:16.174 --> 22:19.177
and that is just
information we've deciphered.

22:19.344 --> 22:22.764
We know we have barely even begun
to scratch the surface.

22:22.931 --> 22:25.767
What if we destroy the cure
for all disease?

22:25.934 --> 22:29.688
Or even information that could lead
to the downfall of the Wraith?

22:29.854 --> 22:34.609
I will try to improve
on McKay's compression ratios, but...

22:34.776 --> 22:38.988
We are at war, Elizabeth.
In war there are casualties.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.374
Ah. Schematics, anyone?

22:52.002 --> 22:55.755
It looks like power runs internally
from the buffer to the weapon.

22:55.922 --> 22:58.383
The hit disrupted the main power conduit.

22:58.550 --> 23:03.388
We need to re-route the power from
our buffer to the weapon so it will arm.

23:03.555 --> 23:08.768
Your masterful grip on the blatantly
obvious continues to impress me.

23:08.935 --> 23:11.354
- Thank you.
- All right.

23:12.689 --> 23:17.027
We need to route power
around these damaged circuits.

23:17.193 --> 23:19.738
If we do that, we should be laughing.

23:19.904 --> 23:22.782
Right... I'm disorientated.
Where are these?

23:25.243 --> 23:28.747
- They're outside.
- What?

23:30.290 --> 23:32.375
Look.

23:34.294 --> 23:37.505
- See?
- Oh, great.

23:37.672 --> 23:41.176
- Someone will need to EVA.
- There's nothing to hang on to.

23:41.343 --> 23:45.930
- I'm not saying it'll be easy or safe.
- OK. So who goes?

23:47.682 --> 23:51.227
- We could draw straws.
- OK, Miller, break out the straws.

23:51.394 --> 23:53.772
It doesn't have to be straws.

23:53.938 --> 23:56.316
We could do rock, paper, scissors.

23:56.483 --> 23:58.360
OK. On three.

23:58.526 --> 24:00.987
One, two, three.

24:05.283 --> 24:08.078
OK, rock, paper, scissors
doesn't work with three.

24:08.244 --> 24:12.332
- Anyone have a pencil?
- Yeah, I think I got one. Here.

24:12.499 --> 24:14.876
Well, get on with it.

24:17.629 --> 24:19.714
OK.

24:20.757 --> 24:23.301
- Shorter piece goes.
- You go first.

24:29.224 --> 24:31.309
Hm. Well done. Good for you.

24:36.189 --> 24:38.483
Miller?

24:39.609 --> 24:43.279
- Yeah.
- You're the best qualified to fix it, sir.

24:43.446 --> 24:46.324
Plight of the dead man. Good.

24:51.496 --> 24:57.752
There's no love lost between her and
Bates, but I can't see her beating him up.

24:58.753 --> 25:01.589
- Ford?
- Ma'am?

25:01.756 --> 25:04.676
What do you think?

25:06.302 --> 25:09.139
I worry about
what she might have done unknowingly.

25:09.305 --> 25:12.434
The Wraith connection
and her nightmares make me nervous.

25:12.600 --> 25:16.771
What are we gonna do, stick her
in the brig? We're talking about Teyla.

25:17.272 --> 25:20.191
- We have a situation on our hands.
- What's going on?

25:20.358 --> 25:23.361
The tests found DNA
in Sergeant Bates's uniform.

25:23.528 --> 25:25.530
- It's not Teyla's?
- No, Major.

25:25.697 --> 25:29.200
- Who is it?
- I ran the test twice to be certain.

25:29.367 --> 25:33.413
It's conclusive.
We have a Wraith in the city.

25:46.217 --> 25:49.763
How is this possible?
How can a Wraith get inside the city?

25:49.929 --> 25:52.766
- They didn't gate in.
- The dart.

25:52.932 --> 25:55.810
- What?
- The Wraith dart. It scanned us.

25:56.895 --> 26:00.065
It made its way through the city,
scanning as it went.

26:00.231 --> 26:03.568
The second it was done,
it self-destructed.

26:05.862 --> 26:08.490
- They beamed into the city.
- Can they do that?

26:08.657 --> 26:12.994
The technology used to sweep people up
into their ships works the opposite way.

26:13.161 --> 26:18.083
The Wraith dart pilot scanned us,
transmitted information to the hive ships,

26:18.249 --> 26:20.335
beamed down and destroyed his ship.

26:20.502 --> 26:24.964
- It seems possible.
- That's when I started to sense the Wraith.

26:25.131 --> 26:30.220
- No wonder you were having nightmares.
- What's he been doing here all this time?

26:30.387 --> 26:34.349
Bates was attacked near the naqahdah
generator that powers this tower.

26:34.516 --> 26:39.145
Maybe the Wraith's job is to knock out
the power before the hive ship gets here.

26:39.312 --> 26:43.900
- Leave us dead in the water.
- Or ensure our self-destruct plan failed.

26:44.067 --> 26:46.695
- Maybe a combination of both.
- Exactly.

26:46.861 --> 26:50.615
We do know for sure that
we have a Wraith intruder in the city

26:50.782 --> 26:53.326
that we have to track down.

26:53.493 --> 26:55.370
I have an idea.

27:04.129 --> 27:06.256
<i>(McKay) How far away?</i>

27:06.423 --> 27:10.218
It's not much more than 30 metres away.

27:10.385 --> 27:13.638
<i>(Miller) We're in position, sir.</i>

27:13.805 --> 27:19.102
Vent the atmosphere and disengage the
artificial gravity in the rear compartment.

27:28.194 --> 27:32.115
OK. Open the rear hatch.

27:51.885 --> 27:53.970
Oh, my.

27:56.973 --> 27:59.059
Rodney?

28:00.060 --> 28:04.314
- Rodney, did you make it?
- I haven't left the rear of the jumper yet.

28:04.481 --> 28:08.193
- Do I need to remind you of the time?
- Yes. Please do. Remind me.

28:08.360 --> 28:11.446
- Are we on a tight schedule?
- Just stating the obvious.

28:11.613 --> 28:13.698
<i>OK. Thank you.</i>

28:13.865 --> 28:16.576
One small step, huh?

28:30.715 --> 28:34.928
<i>(groans) One giant leap.</i>

28:35.095 --> 28:37.639
<i>- (groans)
- Sorry?</i>

28:37.806 --> 28:40.058
<i>- I made it.
- Good.</i>

28:41.559 --> 28:44.813
Let's take a look at this first panel.

28:47.982 --> 28:51.486
This is a biometric sensor
we've had online for a month or so.

28:51.653 --> 28:55.073
It detects irregularities in biometric rhythm
and reports them.

28:55.240 --> 28:59.244
- Wouldn't it have picked up on the Wraith?
- It requires a lot of power.

28:59.411 --> 29:03.289
We've narrowed its field of focus
to scan solely in the gate room,

29:03.456 --> 29:07.293
figuring that was the only place
that the Wraith,

29:07.460 --> 29:09.963
or any other alien,
would enter the city from.

29:10.130 --> 29:12.757
- OK. So that was wrong.
- Yup.

29:12.924 --> 29:17.721
Now, if I could only
expand the scanning field to... My God.

29:17.887 --> 29:20.515
- What?
- That's him. Look.

29:23.226 --> 29:25.437
It works like the life-signs detector,

29:25.603 --> 29:28.273
but it's able to distinguish
different life forms.

29:28.440 --> 29:29.983
- That's him.
- That's him.

29:30.150 --> 29:32.318
- We can track him in real time?
- Yes.

29:32.485 --> 29:36.072
Ford, Teyla, we need two teams.
Let's go get him.

29:36.239 --> 29:37.699
Yes, sir.

29:41.578 --> 29:46.499
This is bad. Very bad.
I'm not sure I can fix this.

29:46.666 --> 29:49.669
<i>- You can fix anything.
- Who told you that?</i>

29:49.836 --> 29:55.050
- You did on several occasions.
- Good thing I drew the short straw.

29:55.216 --> 29:57.302
<i>That's more like it.</i>

30:08.063 --> 30:11.316
The main power conduit's been severed.

30:11.483 --> 30:16.029
I may be able to re-route it
through secondary conduits.

30:16.196 --> 30:19.115
<i>Like a quadruple bypass.</i>

30:19.282 --> 30:23.203
I should be able to help identify
potential secondary conduits.

30:23.370 --> 30:28.083
We're only gonna have time
to try this once. Let's get started.

30:30.251 --> 30:33.588
- Is he still in place?
- Yes, he's still in the same room.

30:33.755 --> 30:36.257
Hasn't moved since we located him.

30:37.258 --> 30:41.179
Let's hope he's still sleeping.
Ford, Teyla, you in position?

30:41.346 --> 30:43.431
<i>(Teyla) Almost.</i>

30:46.267 --> 30:48.353
My team's ready.

30:49.437 --> 30:53.149
We're gonna breach through
from different directions.

30:53.316 --> 30:55.944
If he tries to get out the other door,
take him.

30:56.111 --> 30:58.822
<i>(Ford) Understood.
We'll be a couple of minutes.</i>

30:58.989 --> 31:01.533
All right. Stand by.

31:27.434 --> 31:30.061
OK. That's all I can do from here.

31:30.228 --> 31:32.564
<i>Is power getting through?</i>

31:32.731 --> 31:35.942
- Yes, the power's getting through.
- Oh, thank God.

31:36.109 --> 31:41.281
OK. We're coming in. We're gonna
pick you up and get the hell outta here.

31:41.448 --> 31:44.868
<i>- Sounds like a plan.
- Right.</i>

32:01.551 --> 32:05.722
Nothing will keep us
from our new feeding ground.

32:13.980 --> 32:18.026
You're on vox, sir. We heard
the whole thing and double-timed it.

32:19.944 --> 32:23.281
We got him, Major.
You're going to be OK.

32:34.584 --> 32:37.671
Peter, we're having trouble
docking with the satellite.

32:37.837 --> 32:40.965
See what you can do from your side.

32:41.132 --> 32:43.426
<i>- Oh, dear.
- Oh, dear, what?</i>

32:43.593 --> 32:46.513
When we re-routed power
from the buffer to the weapon,

32:46.680 --> 32:52.352
we inadvertently routed power away
from the docking station in the airlock.

32:52.519 --> 32:54.604
That's going to be a problem.

32:54.771 --> 32:57.565
We'll do it manually
like we did the first time.

32:57.732 --> 33:01.444
You had a spacesuit then. I don't.
The airlock isn't pressurised.

33:03.196 --> 33:07.075
Then we'll...
I'll go back and re-route the power.

33:08.410 --> 33:11.121
There isn't time.
The Wraith ships are too close.

33:11.287 --> 33:13.581
<i>- I know what I'm doing now.
- Rodney.</i>

33:15.333 --> 33:17.919
- Leave me.
- We're not doing that.

33:18.086 --> 33:22.841
Get to a safe distance, then get me once
the satellite's dealt with the Wraith ships.

33:23.008 --> 33:26.177
<i>- Peter...
- It's the only option and you know it.</i>

33:26.344 --> 33:30.849
Besides, this way I can power down
the satellite until they're within range.

33:31.016 --> 33:34.769
There's no way the Wraith will realise
we brought it back online.

33:37.605 --> 33:40.400
We'll cloak and come back for you
after it's done.

33:42.652 --> 33:44.738
After it's done, then.

34:09.137 --> 34:12.139
Good to see you on your feet, sir.

34:12.306 --> 34:14.809
- How you feeling?
- Pins and needles.

34:14.976 --> 34:17.437
Hate getting stunned
by those damn things.

34:17.603 --> 34:20.815
- Has he said anything yet?
- No, sir. Not yet.

34:26.446 --> 34:29.074
Have you got a name?

34:31.951 --> 34:33.828
OK, we'll go with Bob.

34:33.995 --> 34:38.291
Bob, I'm gonna need to know what you've
been doing here the past two weeks

34:38.458 --> 34:40.752
and I'm gonna need to know now.

34:40.918 --> 34:44.464
<i>(growls)</i>

35:02.982 --> 35:06.277
If you're not already powered up,
now would be a good time.

35:10.031 --> 35:12.283
Powering up.

35:19.082 --> 35:22.711
We should be weapons-hot
in 60 seconds.

35:25.380 --> 35:28.466
Dr Weir, it's McKay.
The satellite is armed and ready.

35:28.633 --> 35:32.762
It should fire within the next minute or so.
Keep your fingers crossed.

35:32.929 --> 35:35.348
Fingers crossed.

35:35.515 --> 35:37.600
Good luck.

35:41.187 --> 35:43.690
<i>(growls)</i>

35:48.236 --> 35:50.447
I don't think he's in a talkative mood.

35:50.613 --> 35:54.242
I need to know if he's been transmitting
back to the hive ships.

35:54.409 --> 35:59.789
- Wouldn't we pick up the transmission?
- He could send secure messages.

35:59.956 --> 36:02.334
Maybe I can try and connect with him.

36:03.793 --> 36:05.628
I don't think so.

36:08.423 --> 36:11.885
If the Alpha site has been compromised,
we need to know.

36:20.810 --> 36:22.687
OK, see what you can do.

36:46.711 --> 36:49.964
Switching over from manual
to automatic firing mode.

36:51.841 --> 36:53.718
Stand by.

36:54.678 --> 36:57.305
Standing by.

37:16.032 --> 37:17.826
Yes. We have a kill.

37:17.993 --> 37:20.620
<i>(all cheer)</i>

37:20.787 --> 37:24.082
<i>- We copy that, Rodney.
- One down, two to go.</i>

37:31.881 --> 37:34.217
What are you doing, human?

37:39.097 --> 37:41.725
You're trying to get inside my mind.

37:47.939 --> 37:50.025
Allow me.

37:53.820 --> 37:56.698
<i>- (gasps)
- Teyla! Stop him!</i>

38:02.329 --> 38:04.414
Are you OK?

38:07.000 --> 38:10.712
- My wounds will heal.
- Yeah, but for how long?

38:13.882 --> 38:16.593
I need to know
what you've done to this city.

38:20.555 --> 38:23.224
Listen, Bob.

38:23.391 --> 38:26.644
I have no problem
with killing you whatsoever.

38:35.028 --> 38:36.863
Come on. Hit 'em again.

38:38.156 --> 38:40.659
<i>- We have a problem.
- What? What problem?</i>

38:40.825 --> 38:42.702
<i>(beeping)</i>

38:42.869 --> 38:46.539
It looks like the circuit we re-routed
is overloaded.

38:46.706 --> 38:51.252
The weapon can't fire again.
I'm trying to find another pathway.

38:51.419 --> 38:54.255
- We're coming to pick you up.
- Stay where you are!

38:54.422 --> 38:59.010
- We're cloaked. They won't see us.
- There's no time. Get the hell out of here.

38:59.177 --> 39:01.638
<i>(beeping)</i>

39:04.224 --> 39:07.060
- I'm sorry.
- Get us back to that satellite.

39:17.696 --> 39:19.781
Oh, God.

39:21.783 --> 39:24.077
<i>(Sheppard) I'm not screwing around, Bob.</i>

39:24.244 --> 39:26.955
Did you sabotage this base or not?

39:31.126 --> 39:36.673
Those who feed upon you
will know what you've done to me.

39:40.677 --> 39:44.973
- Yeah, we'll see.
- Sir, maybe we've gone a bit too far.

39:45.140 --> 39:47.267
I don't think we've gone far enough.

39:47.434 --> 39:50.812
Atlantis, this is McKay.
We have lost the satellite.

39:56.067 --> 40:01.364
<i>- Did you take out any more ships?
- Negative. Two hive ships are intact.</i>

40:02.615 --> 40:06.494
Elizabeth, Peter Grodin
was aboard the satellite.

40:10.373 --> 40:14.461
Understood.
What's the status of the other two?

40:14.627 --> 40:17.213
<i>They're not coming any closer.</i>

40:17.380 --> 40:21.217
At the very least,
he's bought us some time.

40:22.594 --> 40:26.222
<i>(Weir) You can't do any more out there.
Return to Atlantis.</i>

40:33.688 --> 40:35.774
On our way.

40:40.862 --> 40:42.947
Put me on city-wide.

40:46.368 --> 40:49.245
May I have your attention, please?

40:49.412 --> 40:51.665
This is Dr Weir.

40:53.541 --> 40:57.879
Our plan to stop the Wraith armada
has failed.

40:58.046 --> 41:00.548
They will make it to Atlantis.

41:00.715 --> 41:04.219
Therefore we must begin
our evacuation plans.

41:04.386 --> 41:08.640
<i>I wish I could tell you all
that this is a fight that we will win,</i>

41:08.807 --> 41:12.268
<i>but I can't do that.</i>

41:12.435 --> 41:17.524
I wish I could tell you we will find
a safe harbour when we leave here.

41:17.691 --> 41:20.694
I can't promise you that either.

41:22.195 --> 41:24.614
I can tell you this.

41:25.824 --> 41:30.328
Up to now you all have accomplished
extraordinary things,

41:30.495 --> 41:34.040
and I believe that
even in the face of an uncertain future,

41:34.207 --> 41:38.586
as long as we stay together
we have a chance to continue to do so.

41:40.130 --> 41:43.091
Now we all have our evacuation duties,

41:43.258 --> 41:45.343
so thank you,

41:45.510 --> 41:47.971
and I'll see you on the other side.

41:50.682 --> 41:55.061
Dr Zelenka,
put the virus program in standby.

41:59.774 --> 42:02.569
<i>(beeping)</i>

42:17.709 --> 42:19.627
<i>(Bob) I will tell you this.</i>

42:21.838 --> 42:27.135
No matter where you flee,
we will find you,

42:27.302 --> 42:31.306
just as surely as we will find Earth.

42:33.433 --> 42:40.565
And when we do, we will feast.
