00:25.326 --> 00:28.494
Alrighty, you
  have a nice day, now.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.396
       Hi, what can I get
         you today, sir?

00:30.498 --> 00:32.698
Hi, um...

00:32.800 --> 00:33.966
    Chocolate glazed, please.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.267
Alright, coming right up.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.002
 Is that, um-- is that for here,
        or is that to go?

00:37.104 --> 00:39.004
Ooh, I'm gonna
 have that one right now!

00:39.106 --> 00:40.205
Donuts, huh?

00:40.307 --> 00:41.874
    Best thing in the world.

00:41.976 --> 00:43.208
Pretty rough
 on the old middle, though.

00:43.310 --> 00:46.945
Oh, haven't you heard?
 These are... diet donuts.

00:47.048 --> 00:48.280
Diet donuts, huh?

00:48.382 --> 00:49.548
That's right, so next time
 you're gonna wanna order

00:49.650 --> 00:51.517
- twice as many.
- Good plan.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.052
         Twice as many.

00:53.154 --> 00:56.522
You have a nice day, now.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.594
- Hey, Lisa.
- Mm-hm?

01:02.696 --> 01:04.029
Would you mind working
 a double tomorrow night?

01:04.131 --> 01:05.096
Yeah, sure thing, Ed.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.265
Perfect.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.536
Goodnight, Ed.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.856
Hello?

03:44.959 --> 03:46.792
              Lisa?

03:49.630 --> 03:50.696
              Lisa?

03:50.798 --> 03:52.331
Yes, Grandma?

03:52.433 --> 03:56.068
Your sister's
   on the phone.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.202
Hey, Lorrie.

03:57.304 --> 04:00.472
Hey, sis.
   Whatcha doin'?

04:00.574 --> 04:02.140
Just getting
   ready for work.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.309
On a Saturday?
   That sucks.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.612
Ah, I like my job.

04:06.714 --> 04:07.879
You're weird.

04:07.982 --> 04:10.849
Takes one to know one.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.851
I miss you.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.787
I miss you, too.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.789
I wanna come visit.

04:17.891 --> 04:20.726
Lorrie, you know
  that you can't do that.

04:20.827 --> 04:23.161
You should
  come up to Allentown.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.463
I wish I could.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.732
I mean, for good.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.500
Really?
 Okay, well, what did Mom say?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.135
 Did Mom say anything about it?

04:30.237 --> 04:32.137
Hey, Mom!
    C'mere!

04:32.239 --> 04:34.006
What?

04:34.108 --> 04:35.474
Lisa's on the phone.

04:35.576 --> 04:38.744
    We both think she should
      move up here with us.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.078
Is that so?

04:40.180 --> 04:41.913
Hi, Mom, I was--
  I was just talking to--

04:42.016 --> 04:43.282
Now, now.

04:43.384 --> 04:46.151
 The whole reason why you moved
in with Grandma was to help her.

04:46.253 --> 04:48.553
      She's countin' on ya.

04:48.656 --> 04:52.291
      You don't want to let
      her down now, do you?

04:52.393 --> 04:54.359
No, but...
   Mom, I--

04:54.461 --> 04:57.663
You be good now.

05:02.102 --> 05:05.170
I'll work on her.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.406
It's okay.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.242
Don't give up, okay?

05:10.344 --> 05:14.346
  <i> We'll get you away from him.</i>
        <i> I promise Lisa.</i>

05:34.835 --> 05:36.935
What time's
  your shift over?

05:37.037 --> 05:38.136
Two.

05:38.238 --> 05:39.538
It's payday, right?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.473
Yes.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.909
Yes, what?

05:44.011 --> 05:46.945
Yes, sir.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.714
You better bring your
 paycheck right home tonight,

05:48.816 --> 05:53.151
- ya hear?
- Yep.

05:53.253 --> 05:56.521
Good girl.

06:02.629 --> 06:03.695
Alrighty.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.164
   And thank you, Pastor Jim.

06:06.266 --> 06:07.532
     You have a good night.

06:07.634 --> 06:08.967
Finally!

06:09.069 --> 06:10.202
I'm sorry, sir.

06:10.304 --> 06:11.636
You should
 have more people working!

06:11.739 --> 06:12.871
Yeah, I know.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.806
      We're under-staffed,
      but that's no excuse.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.341
        So please tell me
        what you'd like,

06:16.443 --> 06:17.876
      and I'll serve you up
          right quick.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.010
It's too late for that.

06:19.113 --> 06:20.178
   I've been waiting forever!

06:20.280 --> 06:21.613
No, you're right, sir.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.181
     No one should ever have
 to wait that long for a donut.

06:23.283 --> 06:26.318
   It's downright un-American.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.423
Alright,
  could I get a, um,

06:31.525 --> 06:33.992
     apple fritter, please,
        and a tuna salad?

06:34.094 --> 06:36.294
You got it!

06:43.504 --> 06:45.237
Hey, Lis!
 You don't wanna forget this.

06:45.339 --> 06:47.906
Oh, thanks.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.942
           Hey, um...

06:51.044 --> 06:54.012
        thanks for taking
         a chance on me,

06:54.114 --> 06:55.714
          moving me up
      to the front counter.

06:55.816 --> 06:58.150
You kidding?
  Customers love ya.

06:58.252 --> 06:59.651
      Even the cranky ones.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.687
Means a lot
 that you believed in me.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.991
Sure.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.294
     I'll see you on Monday!

07:27.347 --> 07:30.549
Good girl...

08:30.110 --> 08:31.309
      What are you doing?!
      What are you doing?!

08:31.411 --> 08:33.078
- Don't make a sound!
- Please don't hurt me!

08:33.179 --> 08:34.645
        I'll do anything,
    but please don't hurt me!

08:34.748 --> 08:35.947
Shut up!

08:36.049 --> 08:37.549
Okay...

08:48.395 --> 08:49.594
- Face the window!
- LISA:

08:49.696 --> 08:51.496
         Close your eyes
      and keep them closed.

08:51.598 --> 08:57.068
            Alright?
 You look at me and you're dead.

08:57.170 --> 09:00.939
     Now show me a good time
        or I'll kill you.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.621
Get dressed.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.763
       Whoever taught you
         was real good.

09:24.865 --> 09:28.733
   You must have a boyfriend.

09:28.835 --> 09:33.305
You said if I--
  but you said if I do--

09:33.407 --> 09:36.841
       What are you doing?
     Why are you doing this?

09:36.944 --> 09:38.376
Shut up!

09:38.478 --> 09:39.945
     I'm not done with you.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.389
I'm taking you
 somewhere more comfortable.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.824
            Alright?

09:52.926 --> 09:54.959
       And you're gonna do
  everything I tell you to do.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.100
Are you
 trying to cause trouble?

11:09.202 --> 11:10.068
        Pick up the pace!

11:10.170 --> 11:12.303
Okay, I'm sorry!
   I'm sorry!

11:24.217 --> 11:27.786
Up, up, come on.

11:50.977 --> 11:54.012
Nobody's
  gonna bother us here.

12:16.603 --> 12:20.371
Take
  your clothes off.

12:28.381 --> 12:32.016
          That's right,
         nice and slow.

12:35.021 --> 12:39.591
       Let me look at you.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.248
Keep your eyes shut.

13:03.350 --> 13:06.851
Okay.

13:11.825 --> 13:16.427
Your skin's so soft.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.600
Get
  down on the ground.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.836
           Face down!

13:24.938 --> 13:28.306
Please...

13:28.408 --> 13:31.009
        Don't hurt me...

13:31.111 --> 13:35.280
Bitch!

14:19.159 --> 14:22.460
Just so
  you don't forget.

14:26.900 --> 14:30.401
Lisa, Lisa!

14:41.348 --> 14:43.281
Uncle Jim...

14:43.383 --> 14:47.085
          Aunt Carol...

14:47.187 --> 14:49.787
           Aunt Carol?

14:49.890 --> 14:53.391
             Lorrie?

15:07.307 --> 15:10.675
What's your name?

15:10.777 --> 15:14.512
Carol.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.849
          What's yours?

15:17.951 --> 15:22.320
I can't
  tell you that, babe.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.825
        How old are you?

15:27.928 --> 15:29.827
I'm 20.

15:29.930 --> 15:33.831
That's good.
  That's real good.

15:33.934 --> 15:37.802
     'Cause I'm no pervert,
            you know?

15:37.904 --> 15:40.972
Why are you doing this?

15:41.074 --> 15:42.340
'Cause you
  have it all coming.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.642
       You're all bitches.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.880
How old is
  your granddaughter?

15:48.982 --> 15:50.081
Seventeen.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.349
And what time was
 she supposed to be home?

15:51.451 --> 15:53.751
She worked
  an extra shift until 2,

15:53.853 --> 15:55.653
          so we thought
       to see her by 2:30,

15:55.755 --> 15:57.121
   maybe 3 at the very latest.

15:57.223 --> 15:59.057
- Is that 3 am?
- Yes, sir.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.858
Has Lisa ever run away?

16:00.961 --> 16:02.060
Never.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.861
Any reason she might
  want to run away now?

16:03.964 --> 16:05.563
       Problems at school?
        Trouble at home?

16:05.665 --> 16:07.665
No.
   Not at all.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.268
        But I can't think
        what's happened.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.736
       We're worried sick.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.273
Mom?

16:15.375 --> 16:16.441
What's the matter?

16:16.543 --> 16:19.010
Good morning, ma'am.
  I'm Officer Gibbons.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.579
 Seems your daughter Lisa's been
 reported missing down in Tampa.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.348
Well, she hasn't
  turned up around here.

16:23.450 --> 16:24.349
Have you
   heard from her?

16:24.451 --> 16:26.384
Yes, I-- I talked
  to her yesterday.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.852
 She was getting ready for work.

16:27.954 --> 16:28.886
No word
  from her since then?

16:28.989 --> 16:30.321
She's fine.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.123
  She's probably just run off.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.993
If Lisa calls
 or comes by you'll let us know.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.895
She has a nice home.

16:37.998 --> 16:41.199
        She's ungrateful.

16:41.301 --> 16:44.335
We'll keep you posted.

16:50.076 --> 16:52.543
Officer?

16:52.645 --> 16:55.880
   Lisa wouldn't just run off
        and not tell me.

16:55.982 --> 16:59.183
  Something's happened to her.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.462
How do you
   like your room?

17:11.564 --> 17:13.464
Are you kidding me,
  Grandma, it's perfect!

17:13.566 --> 17:15.199
          It's perfect.
           I love it.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.801
Aw!
  Such a pretty girl!

17:17.904 --> 17:20.570
     It can be hard keeping
   such a nice home, you know?

17:20.673 --> 17:21.606
I know, Grandma.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.141
       I'm gonna be a big
        help to you guys.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.410
I know you will.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.979
      Sometimes, there are
      things you have to do

17:28.080 --> 17:32.350
        to keep on living
      in such a nice home.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.752
     It's all right, honey.

17:34.854 --> 17:38.156
       You're gonna learn
       how to treat a man.

17:43.630 --> 17:46.497
I'm sorry...

17:46.599 --> 17:47.799
           I'm sorry.

17:47.901 --> 17:51.436
           I'm sorry.
           I'm sorry.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.372
Sorry for what?

17:56.409 --> 17:59.844
That women haven't
  been very nice to you.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.824
That's enough, babe.

18:14.894 --> 18:18.863
I can tell
  you're very handsome.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.627
Um, I'm kind of
   thirsty, um...

19:11.351 --> 19:14.652
    I start analyzing the car
    underneath my blindfold.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.321
    Anything I can see:
    the green digital clock,

19:17.423 --> 19:19.724
     leather steering wheel.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.726
    In front and back
    both had red carpet.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.461
    It was like thick carpet.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.129
    It wasn't like
    regular car carpet,

19:25.231 --> 19:26.898
    like maybe he put it
    in there himself.

19:28.168 --> 19:31.035
    I notice the word Magnum
    is on the dashboard.

19:31.137 --> 19:33.838
    Magnum, "Magnum, P.I."

19:33.940 --> 19:37.074
    I had to associate with
    something I already knew.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.843
"Magnum, P.I." was a show.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.378
And that's how I remembered
   the name of the car.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.993
Two sugars,
  and one cream, right?

19:56.062 --> 19:57.094
Yeah.

19:58.264 --> 19:59.897
Just like you
  wanted, my friend.

19:59.966 --> 20:03.868
        How long are you
     on the road this time?

20:08.675 --> 20:10.208
Afternoon.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.610
        What can I do for
         Tampa's finest?

20:12.712 --> 20:13.811
I'd like to ask
  you a few questions

20:13.913 --> 20:16.881
        about Lisa McVey.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.249
She worked
  here last night?

20:18.351 --> 20:20.751
Yes.

20:20.820 --> 20:21.886
What time did she leave?

20:21.955 --> 20:24.455
It was a little
  after 2 in the morning.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.390
And do you know if
 she was headed straight home?

20:26.459 --> 20:28.492
I just assumed she was.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.062
         It was so late.

20:31.130 --> 20:34.332
She never made it.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.833
      There's no indication
          of foul play.

20:35.902 --> 20:39.337
          It's possible
      she's just run away.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.339
Just doesn't seem like her.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.941
    She's a responsible girl.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.143
          Hard worker.
     She's a great employee.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.012
Did anything
 happen during her shift?

20:48.081 --> 20:49.146
      Something that might
         have upset her?

20:49.215 --> 20:50.715
Not that I can think of.

20:50.817 --> 20:54.752
 She was just her regular self,

20:54.854 --> 20:56.454
            until...

20:56.556 --> 20:58.222
What?

20:58.291 --> 21:01.492
At the very end,
 when she was taking off...

21:01.561 --> 21:05.896
     she seemed so, um, sad
        all of a sudden.

21:05.965 --> 21:09.000
    I told her I'd see her on
  Monday and she didn't answer.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.935
         She thanked me
       for promoting her.

21:11.037 --> 21:13.904
   I promoted her months ago.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.609
           Oh, my God.

21:18.678 --> 21:22.046
Do you think Lisa
 might have harmed herself?

21:26.619 --> 21:28.786
This just in,
  a special report.

21:28.855 --> 21:31.389
   Last night in the suburban
      Tampa neighbourhood,

21:31.491 --> 21:32.623
          a teenager...

21:32.692 --> 21:35.192
I made you
   a sandwich.

21:35.261 --> 21:36.661
             Eat it.
            Take it.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.629
    Take it, and eat it, huh?

21:38.698 --> 21:40.131
I'm in
 the neighbourhood where police

21:40.233 --> 21:42.500
        are investigating
        a disappearance.

21:42.568 --> 21:44.769
      The teen was reported
      missing this morning

21:44.837 --> 21:46.904
  when she failed to come home
     from a late night shift

21:47.006 --> 21:48.739
     at a local donut shop.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.809
  The teenager's bike was found
    at a nearby parking lot.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.944
 Police are so far not releasing
    any more details, but...

21:54.013 --> 21:55.079
Are they
  talking about you?

21:55.148 --> 21:56.681
   Are they talking about you?
       Are you a teenager?

21:56.749 --> 21:58.482
- Are you a kid?
- No!

21:58.551 --> 21:59.684
They better not
  be talking about you.

21:59.752 --> 22:00.918
I'm 19,
  but they just got that

22:00.987 --> 22:03.788
because my birthday's next week.
     I'm 20, I'm almost 20.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.156
Liar!
 Do you think I'm stupid?

22:05.258 --> 22:07.391
I don't!
  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22:07.493 --> 22:10.328
         Please, please!
         Oh, please, oh!

22:10.430 --> 22:11.529
      I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

22:11.631 --> 22:12.563
Lisa!

22:12.665 --> 22:15.433
              Lisa!

22:15.501 --> 22:18.302
So you don't forget me.

22:29.849 --> 22:33.017
Don't give up, okay?

22:35.922 --> 22:40.257
I have to
  go to the bathroom.

22:42.362 --> 22:45.096
         I don't want to
        pee on your bed.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.776
Okay...

23:03.916 --> 23:07.618
        Well, I can't go
       with you watching.

23:11.758 --> 23:15.693
I'm looking away.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.895
Please could you
  just wait outside?

23:17.997 --> 23:19.463
      I'm not, I'm just...

23:19.532 --> 23:22.099
    I just want some privacy.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.643
Be quick.

24:06.078 --> 24:08.612
Hurry up in there.

24:30.102 --> 24:32.670
Don't give up.

25:04.337 --> 25:07.171
- Hurry up!
- I know, I'm just peeing.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.543
I'm coming in.

25:15.281 --> 25:16.580
Did you
   lock the door?

25:16.649 --> 25:17.815
      You locked the door,
          you little--

25:17.884 --> 25:19.350
         Open the door!

25:19.452 --> 25:22.386
         Open the door!

25:30.563 --> 25:31.695
What are
  you doing in here, huh?

25:31.797 --> 25:32.696
   You think you're so smart.

25:32.765 --> 25:33.664
No, I'm just
  washing my hands.

25:33.733 --> 25:34.965
Think
  you're so smart.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.201
     You stupid little girl.

25:37.270 --> 25:39.136
       Uh, you want me to
      kill you right here?

25:39.205 --> 25:40.938
- I'll kill you right here.
- No, don't.

25:41.040 --> 25:45.209
- I shouldn't have--
- That's right.

25:45.278 --> 25:47.177
God, it's hot in here.
    Jesus.

25:47.246 --> 25:48.512
  You must be so uncomfortable.

25:48.581 --> 25:51.549
 Can I get you a glass of water?
            Do you...

25:53.586 --> 25:56.554
Wanna get me
  a glass of water?

25:56.656 --> 25:57.855
    Uh, that's what you want?

25:57.957 --> 26:01.292
Can I do that for you?

26:31.724 --> 26:34.792
Is that better?

26:44.303 --> 26:48.138
Don't ever
 do that again, do you hear me?

27:42.395 --> 27:44.261
Sneaky little bitch.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.629
- No, please, no!
- Sneaky little bitch!

27:45.731 --> 27:47.031
         Are you trying
        to cause trouble?

27:47.066 --> 27:48.632
No, I wasn't, I wasn't!
  I promise, I promise.

27:48.701 --> 27:49.600
Trying
  to cause trouble?

27:49.702 --> 27:51.001
No!

27:51.070 --> 27:52.903
Are you
 <i> trying</i> to make trouble?

27:52.972 --> 27:54.405
I just want to come home!

27:54.473 --> 27:55.706
Out of the question!

27:55.775 --> 28:00.310
You don't know what
  Grandma's making me do!

28:03.916 --> 28:06.884
It could be a lot worse.

28:09.555 --> 28:10.587
How can you just do that?

28:10.690 --> 28:14.224
        How can you just
     let her do that to me?

28:14.293 --> 28:17.327
Do you think
   you're special?

28:17.430 --> 28:19.463
              Huh?

28:19.565 --> 28:24.201
         Be grateful for
        what you've got!

28:24.270 --> 28:27.304
        There's no better
      life waiting for you!

28:27.373 --> 28:30.941
What is wrong with you?
  I can have a good life!

28:31.010 --> 28:32.576
       I can, and I will!

28:32.645 --> 28:35.045
     I'm gonna have a family
  that actually cares about me.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.680
       And I'm gonna care
        about them, too.

28:36.749 --> 28:38.682
     I swear I'll care about
    them till the day I die.

28:38.784 --> 28:42.019
       I'm gonna be a much
     better mother than you!

28:42.121 --> 28:43.420
Please!

28:43.489 --> 28:44.755
 I was trying to call my father!

28:44.824 --> 28:46.323
- I was just trying to call--
- Don't lie to me!

28:46.425 --> 28:47.491
I'm not lying to you!

28:47.560 --> 28:49.493
    I just wanted to let him
       know that I'm okay

28:49.562 --> 28:51.161
  and that everything is fine,
       everything's fine.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.162
You think I'm stupid?

28:52.264 --> 28:53.130
I don't think
  you're stupid, no!

28:53.199 --> 28:54.031
Huh?
  You think I'm stupid?

28:54.100 --> 28:55.365
I don't,
  I promise you, just--

28:55.434 --> 28:57.768
  I'm really worried about him.
   He's been so sick recently

28:57.870 --> 28:59.103
       and I'm the one who
       takes care of him.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.405
Listen, I'm everything-- I'm all
 he's got in this entire world.

29:01.474 --> 29:05.109
    Please, please, please...

29:05.211 --> 29:06.577
           You know...

29:06.645 --> 29:08.178
  You know what, you remind me
      of him a little bit.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.415
         You do, you do.

29:11.484 --> 29:13.484
          A good man...

29:13.586 --> 29:17.921
    who's under-appreciated.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.692
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

29:21.761 --> 29:25.028
        And he's so sweet
        and he's so kind.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.330
  And he just loves me so much

29:26.398 --> 29:28.198
      and he's always taken
      such good care of me.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.433
      But then he got sick.

29:29.502 --> 29:32.770
        And now I have to
        take care of him.

29:32.838 --> 29:35.305
         And I bring him
       medicine every day,

29:35.374 --> 29:37.875
      and I make him soup.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.943
       Because I just want
        him to get better

29:40.012 --> 29:42.813
  so that we can have a good...

29:42.882 --> 29:45.149
         life together.

30:04.837 --> 30:07.404
His fantasies to him were real
   and he was acting on it.

30:07.506 --> 30:08.605
    I had to play on that.

30:09.809 --> 30:12.576
    I was able to learn
    how to handle him.

30:12.678 --> 30:14.244
    I never screamed at him.
    I never fought him.

30:15.815 --> 30:18.148
At one point, he took my hands

30:18.250 --> 30:20.017
       and put them
    all over his face--

30:20.119 --> 30:22.920
          pock mark;
    short, clean mustache;

30:23.022 --> 30:25.155
    his ears were small.

30:25.257 --> 30:27.958
    Never saw his face
    with my eyes,

30:28.060 --> 30:29.526
but through my hands I did.

30:29.628 --> 30:31.428
I saw him through my hands.

30:31.530 --> 30:34.097
 I knew I was gaining his trust.

30:36.769 --> 30:39.536
He took me to the living room
and sat me on the couch.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.171
        He turns a TV on.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.974
    A newsbreak came on
and they were searching for

30:44.076 --> 30:46.410
    a 17-year-old had been
    abducted off her bicycle.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.348
         And it hit me.
         Reality set in.

30:51.450 --> 30:54.218
           I lost it.
        I started crying.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.120
    I started shaking.
    I started screaming.

30:57.223 --> 31:00.958
He's screaming profanity,
really sent him into a rage.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.594
    He comes up behind me,
    puts the gun to my head,

31:03.696 --> 31:04.995
    orders me to stop crying.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.231
Please don't make me kill you.

31:07.333 --> 31:08.332
You continue to cry, you're
gonna force me to kill you.

32:03.656 --> 32:05.555
You're
 finally here!

32:05.624 --> 32:10.060
And Mom says
  I can stay the weekend!

32:20.806 --> 32:24.341
I know we didn't meet
 under the best circumstances.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.777
             But...

32:26.845 --> 32:29.613
        I could still be
        your girlfriend.

32:32.384 --> 32:35.352
      But you gotta let me
         go home, okay?

32:38.991 --> 32:43.126
       So I can take care
          of my father.

32:43.228 --> 32:45.395
               Hm?
          He needs me.

32:49.969 --> 32:53.637
        I know you didn't
        mean to hurt me.

32:53.739 --> 32:57.774
       I know that you're
   a nice person, I can tell.

33:00.612 --> 33:04.448
      Just let me go home.

33:07.453 --> 33:12.022
I like
  talking to you, babe.

33:12.091 --> 33:14.391
Me too.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.896
Can't someone else
 take care of your father?

33:19.965 --> 33:22.933
    Don't you have a sister?

33:23.002 --> 33:25.202
No.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.942
           Okay, stop.
          Give me that.

33:32.011 --> 33:35.846
What are
  you doing with that?

33:35.914 --> 33:40.150
If he touches you,
  I will kill him.

33:40.219 --> 33:41.485
- Lisa!
- I will do it.

33:41.553 --> 33:44.087
You'll go to jail!

33:44.189 --> 33:45.489
I don't care.

33:45.557 --> 33:46.556
         He'll be dead.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.825
      And this'll be over.

33:48.894 --> 33:51.828
       And you'll be safe.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.746
The hunt
 continues for the killer

34:10.815 --> 34:13.817
    who has terrorized Tampa
     for the past 6 months.

34:13.886 --> 34:16.453
        The latest victim
      remains unidentified,

34:16.522 --> 34:20.924
but police are working overtime,
 hoping for a break in the case.

34:20.993 --> 34:22.993
So far police are
 not releasing any more details,

34:23.062 --> 34:25.094
 but we will continue to update
      you on any further--

34:30.702 --> 34:33.503
What am I
  gonna do with you?

34:33.572 --> 34:35.972
We can just start over.
We can just start over, I mean--

34:36.041 --> 34:40.476
Shut up
  and let me think!

34:40.545 --> 34:42.512
You could take me
  back to my father.

34:42.614 --> 34:43.746
   So I can take care of him.

34:43.849 --> 34:46.248
 I don't want to be any trouble.

34:46.318 --> 34:50.353
I gotta
   get rid of you.

34:50.456 --> 34:53.290
- Put these on.
- Okay.

35:03.168 --> 35:05.268
You don't want to do this,
 you don't have to do this.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.570
Shut up!

35:06.638 --> 35:07.671
I'm not gonna
 tell anyone, I swear, I--

35:07.739 --> 35:09.473
Shut your mouth!

35:09.575 --> 35:11.408
Please don't do this!

35:11.477 --> 35:14.878
   You don't have to do this.

35:14.947 --> 35:16.580
         No, no, please,
         please, please!

35:16.648 --> 35:18.515
    Please, please, my dad--
        my dad's gonna--

35:18.584 --> 35:21.051
Get up!

35:21.120 --> 35:22.219
- I'm not gonna tell!
- Get up!

35:22.287 --> 35:24.221
I swear, I swear!
  I'm not gonna tell!

35:24.289 --> 35:26.490
You want me
  to kill you right here?

35:26.592 --> 35:28.125
         You want me to
      kill you right here?

35:29.528 --> 35:30.827
Then walk.

35:48.347 --> 35:49.946
Never should
 have kept you this long.

35:53.719 --> 35:56.586
Make a wish, make a wish!

36:14.072 --> 36:16.573
We love it
  when you come visit.

36:16.642 --> 36:20.677
   You're such a special girl
          and so smart.

37:02.487 --> 37:04.321
You think
  you're so smart, huh?

37:04.389 --> 37:06.289
       You try that again,
  and I'll kill you right here,

37:06.391 --> 37:08.091
       you understand me?

37:08.160 --> 37:09.492
       You understand me?

37:09.595 --> 37:13.029
Yeah.

38:06.518 --> 38:11.021
No, no!

38:11.089 --> 38:12.222
              Aah!
             Please!

38:12.291 --> 38:14.858
             Please!
             Please!

38:14.960 --> 38:16.860
      Please don't kill me!

38:16.928 --> 38:19.296
     I'll take care of you.

38:19.364 --> 38:22.766
         I'm your girl!
         I'm your girl!

38:22.868 --> 38:24.701
           I'm yours!

38:27.873 --> 38:30.106
             Please.

38:30.175 --> 38:33.710
      I don't want to die.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.226
If you
   go to the cops,

38:50.295 --> 38:51.428
      tell them I'm black,

38:51.496 --> 38:54.030
      short, and muscular.

38:54.132 --> 38:55.332
Okay.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.734
You stay
  here for five minutes.

38:57.803 --> 39:00.036
     And you don't take your
   blindfold off before then.

39:00.138 --> 39:02.972
Okay.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.203
Where the hell
   have you been?

41:47.272 --> 41:48.738
You been out with a boy?

41:48.840 --> 41:50.607
I was kidnapped!

41:50.675 --> 41:53.009
- Bullshit!
- I'm telling the truth!

41:53.078 --> 41:53.977
Liar!

41:54.045 --> 41:55.545
It's the truth,
   it's the truth!

41:55.647 --> 41:56.813
Morris!
    Stop!

41:56.915 --> 41:59.382
           Stop, stop!
          Stop, stop...

41:59.451 --> 42:01.651
- Liar!
- Stop, stop, stop.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.720
             There.
              Yeah.

42:08.460 --> 42:12.729
Better call the cops
 and let 'em know you're home.

42:12.831 --> 42:14.964
     Tell us what happened.

42:15.066 --> 42:16.332
I was kidnapped!

42:16.401 --> 42:17.700
The truth!

42:17.769 --> 42:19.702
I was raped!

42:19.771 --> 42:21.070
Sick lies.

42:21.139 --> 42:23.940
I have been
   through hell...

42:24.009 --> 42:25.775
How can you even
  look me in the eye?

42:25.844 --> 42:30.547
Why won't you believe me?

42:31.883 --> 42:35.385
   Why won't you believe me?!

42:35.453 --> 42:38.488
Officer Lopez, please.
  It's Diane Martin.

42:38.557 --> 42:41.991
      I'm calling about my
   granddaughter, Lisa McVey.

42:43.361 --> 42:46.029
- Lopez.
- Oh, hi, Officer Lopez.

42:46.097 --> 42:48.932
    I just wanted you to know
  that Lisa finally showed up.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.034
- Is she okay?
- Oh, she's fine.

42:51.136 --> 42:52.135
         It was nothing!

42:52.237 --> 42:53.636
Glad to hear
  she made it home okay.

42:53.705 --> 42:55.939
She told us some crazy
 story about being kidnapped.

42:56.007 --> 42:57.874
- She was kidnapped?
- Well, she made it up.

42:57.943 --> 42:59.108
        I don't know what
       gets into her head.

42:59.177 --> 43:02.679
Well... I'm gonna
 need to talk to her, then.

43:02.747 --> 43:03.746
- What?
- She's a minor,

43:03.815 --> 43:04.948
         claiming to be
     the victim of a crime.

43:05.016 --> 43:05.915
      We have to follow up.

43:05.984 --> 43:07.850
    It's standard procedure.

43:07.953 --> 43:09.218
        I'll pick her up,

43:09.287 --> 43:11.588
  take her back to the station
        for an interview.

43:11.656 --> 43:13.489
Well...

43:13.558 --> 43:16.826
 if that's what you've gotta do,
         alright, then.

43:16.928 --> 43:18.194
            Goodbye.

43:22.300 --> 43:24.601
They're coming over
 to take you in for questioning.

43:24.703 --> 43:26.235
The cops
  are coming here?

43:26.304 --> 43:28.271
Don't worry about it.

43:28.340 --> 43:31.474
        Lisa isn't gonna
     cause any more trouble.

43:31.576 --> 43:33.876
Don't you make a fool of us now.

43:33.945 --> 43:38.715
Not a word about our lives here.
           Understand?

44:06.611 --> 44:08.578
And you say
  this man raped you?

44:08.680 --> 44:10.513
Repeatedly.
    Yeah.

44:10.582 --> 44:14.784
       Uh, the entire time
          I was there.

44:14.853 --> 44:17.754
That's a vicious
  and prolonged assault.

44:17.822 --> 44:19.222
It was.

44:19.290 --> 44:21.257
You don't have any
 bruises or marks on you.

44:21.326 --> 44:26.095
He threatened
  to kill me, so I...

44:26.164 --> 44:30.366
       I didn't fight him.
      I wanted to survive.

44:30.435 --> 44:32.201
Did you ever
  scream for help?

44:32.303 --> 44:34.037
No, no.

44:34.139 --> 44:35.938
    I knew that that would--

44:36.007 --> 44:38.107
 that would make him pretty mad.

44:40.545 --> 44:41.511
Oh, didn't
  mean to interrupt.

44:41.579 --> 44:42.645
No problem.
   What's up?

44:42.714 --> 44:43.946
Task force meeting
  got moved up an hour.

44:44.015 --> 44:45.648
Ah.
    Okay.

44:45.717 --> 44:48.785
    I should be able to wrap
  things up here pretty quick.

44:48.887 --> 44:51.187
Uh...

44:51.256 --> 44:53.322
         So... you said
   he untied you at one point.

44:53.425 --> 44:54.390
Yeah.

44:54.459 --> 44:55.591
Why didn't
  you try to run away?

44:55.660 --> 44:58.261
He threatened to kill me,

44:58.329 --> 44:59.996
   and I planned on making it
       out of there alive.

45:00.098 --> 45:02.331
        I-- I cooperated.

45:02.434 --> 45:03.833
      Except for one time.

45:03.902 --> 45:05.835
      He made me a sandwich
and was yelling at me to eat it.

45:05.937 --> 45:07.804
 And I just-- the smell of it--

45:07.872 --> 45:10.540
He made you lunch?

45:14.079 --> 45:18.748
     Okay, your grandma says
   you're making this all up.

45:18.817 --> 45:22.452
        Is this just some
     story to get attention?

45:22.554 --> 45:23.753
No.

45:23.855 --> 45:26.089
               No!
              I...

45:34.232 --> 45:38.634
Okay.
  Uh, excuse me a moment.

45:41.673 --> 45:44.073
What are...

46:06.297 --> 46:07.764
Hi.

46:07.866 --> 46:10.233
        I am so sorry to
        keep you waiting.

46:10.301 --> 46:12.902
    Things are just a little
     bit crazy around here.

46:12.971 --> 46:15.605
  Now, I am Detective Russell.

46:15.707 --> 46:18.875
       This is my partner,
        Detective Castle.

46:18.943 --> 46:22.612
        Officer Lopez has
     brought us up to speed.

46:22.680 --> 46:25.815
        Okay, so you say

46:25.917 --> 46:28.684
     your assailant brought
        to an apartment?

46:28.753 --> 46:31.354
           Was that a
      ground floor, or...?

46:31.422 --> 46:33.289
No, that was--
  it was a second storey

46:33.358 --> 46:35.358
 because we went up some steps.

46:35.426 --> 46:36.893
Maybe
  it was a stoop...?

46:36.995 --> 46:40.463
No, no.
   We, um...

46:40.532 --> 46:43.966
  I counted 22 steps before we
got to the top of the staircase.

46:44.035 --> 46:46.602
You noticed that,
 with everything going on?

46:46.671 --> 46:48.004
Yeah, yeah, well,
  I made it a point

46:48.072 --> 46:50.940
   to take in my surroundings
      so that I could, um,

46:51.009 --> 46:54.877
      store it in my brain
         for the police.

46:54.946 --> 46:57.513
Uh, Lisa,
  what we mean is that

46:57.549 --> 47:00.316
  it's hard to notice anything
  during such a violent ordeal.

47:00.385 --> 47:02.585
   And yet it's a very unusual
   thing for you to remember.

47:02.654 --> 47:06.989
Well, a very unusual
  thing happened to me.

47:07.058 --> 47:09.992
      And I knew that I had
    to gather evidence, so...

47:10.061 --> 47:11.260
             I did.

47:11.329 --> 47:12.461
"Gather evidence."

47:12.530 --> 47:14.096
Yes, ma'am.
    Yeah.

47:14.199 --> 47:15.231
Like a cop.

47:15.333 --> 47:19.035
Yeah,
  to catch the bad guy.

47:19.103 --> 47:21.671
So he blindfolded you

47:21.739 --> 47:23.773
          and took you
   to an apartment building--

47:23.842 --> 47:24.807
Oh, well,
  I'm not really sure

47:24.876 --> 47:25.942
  it was an apartment building.

47:26.010 --> 47:27.543
     It kind of felt like it
    was more of an apartment

47:27.645 --> 47:30.880
         that was above
       an office building.

47:30.949 --> 47:33.983
 I mean, I was there all Sunday
 and I was listening for noises,

47:34.052 --> 47:35.818
      any kind of activity,
    and I didn't-- I didn't--

47:35.887 --> 47:38.354
   I mean, there was no sound
   of people coming and going.

47:38.423 --> 47:41.090
     There was no neighbour
       sounds or anything.

47:43.461 --> 47:47.029
Lisa, do you
  watch a lot of TV?

47:47.098 --> 47:50.800
Yeah, I guess.

47:50.869 --> 47:53.803
- Why?
- Cop shows?

47:56.341 --> 47:57.807
Sure, I guess.

47:57.876 --> 47:59.675
  I don't really understand why
 you're asking me this, though.

47:59.744 --> 48:00.910
We're just trying
  to get to the bottom

48:00.979 --> 48:02.445
    of what really happened.

48:02.513 --> 48:04.947
Yeah, I've been trying to
 tell you that since I got here.

48:05.016 --> 48:07.016
           I've been--

48:11.723 --> 48:14.523
Well, were you
 blindfolded the whole time?

48:14.592 --> 48:16.559
Uh-huh, yeah,
  almost the entire time.

48:16.628 --> 48:19.395
Well, did you get
 a good look at the man's face?

48:19.464 --> 48:21.330
No, but I could
  describe it to you.

48:21.399 --> 48:26.002
- How?
- He let me touch it.

48:26.070 --> 48:27.236
So you're saying
  you "saw" his face

48:27.338 --> 48:30.973
      but with your hands?

48:31.042 --> 48:33.242
I "saw" a lot.

48:37.649 --> 48:39.882
Look, Lisa...

48:39.951 --> 48:42.518
     We are all girls here.

48:42.587 --> 48:44.053
       You can talk to us.

48:44.155 --> 48:46.622
        We... we get it.

48:46.658 --> 48:49.592
   You know, maybe you met up
  with some friends after work,

48:49.694 --> 48:51.928
      you partied a little,

48:51.996 --> 48:53.796
     you stayed out a little
       too late to go home

48:53.865 --> 48:54.897
     without a good excuse.

48:54.966 --> 48:57.967
- We get it!
- You don't get it.

48:58.036 --> 48:59.936
- Come on, Lisa.
- You don't get it.

49:00.004 --> 49:03.272
- Just tell us the truth.
- I was kidnapped!

49:03.374 --> 49:04.774
          I was raped!

49:04.842 --> 49:08.678
   Why does nobody believe me?

49:12.650 --> 49:15.618
Lisa?

49:15.720 --> 49:18.220
              Lisa?

49:31.536 --> 49:32.935
He grabs me, hugs me, he said,

49:33.037 --> 49:35.004
    I'm sorry you had
    to go through this.

49:35.106 --> 49:37.707
     He gets out of the car.
 He opens the door, lets me out.

49:37.809 --> 49:38.808
Said, stay here for 5 minutes

49:38.910 --> 49:42.445
    and I'll let you live,
    and he drove off.

49:45.817 --> 49:48.617
         I'm like, what?

49:48.720 --> 49:51.287
    Now I'm totally lost,
    totally confused.

49:51.389 --> 49:53.155
Is he pointing the gun at me?

49:53.257 --> 49:56.058
 Is he gonna actually change his
      mind and run me over?

49:57.895 --> 49:59.128
    Why am I not dead?

49:59.230 --> 50:00.162
    What--what happened?

50:03.001 --> 50:04.467
    And then it hit me.

50:04.569 --> 50:05.534
        Oh, dear God.

50:07.205 --> 50:08.237
    He can come back for me.

50:09.907 --> 50:13.442
Is he gonna come back for me
 thinking he made a mistake?

50:22.086 --> 50:24.253
We keep hitting
 the same wall with our killer.

50:24.355 --> 50:25.521
 As you can see from the photos,

50:25.590 --> 50:27.656
       he has got no clear
         physical type.

50:27.725 --> 50:31.093
      The victims have been
      prostitutes, dancers,

50:31.162 --> 50:32.461
        a factory worker.

50:32.530 --> 50:33.863
     We had three homicides

50:33.931 --> 50:35.798
     the first three months
          of this case.

50:35.867 --> 50:38.067
         We've had three
       in the last month,

50:38.136 --> 50:40.636
       two of them in just
       the last few weeks.

50:40.738 --> 50:42.538
        He is escalating.

50:42.607 --> 50:44.240
  There's one thing in common:

50:44.308 --> 50:46.575
       all of the victims
        were found bound.

50:46.677 --> 50:49.111
       Mostly using rope.

50:49.180 --> 50:52.448
   One was found with a noose
     still around her neck.

50:52.517 --> 50:53.916
   There's no other clear M.O.

50:53.985 --> 50:55.251
    He's consistently brutal

50:55.319 --> 50:57.353
    but he's got no favoured
       method of killing.

50:57.422 --> 50:59.522
         Some have been
      raped and strangled,

50:59.590 --> 51:02.024
          one was shot
    in the back of the head.

51:02.093 --> 51:04.193
 Another had her throat slashed.

51:04.262 --> 51:05.294
 All the victims have been found

51:05.363 --> 51:06.996
         far from where
      they were last seen,

51:07.065 --> 51:09.031
    which means he is likely
   transporting them in a car.

51:09.133 --> 51:10.733
  But he is dumping the bodies

51:10.802 --> 51:12.968
          in different
      locations each time.

51:13.037 --> 51:16.939
    An orange grove, a wooded
  area just off the interstate.

51:17.041 --> 51:18.541
The outskirts of a cattle ranch.

51:18.609 --> 51:20.209
     He's all over the map.

51:20.311 --> 51:21.577
          Yeah, Serge?

51:21.679 --> 51:23.379
Next, listen up.

51:23.448 --> 51:25.314
 This guy knows what he's doing.

51:25.383 --> 51:27.750
 These women were all taken late
 at night, when they were alone.

51:27.819 --> 51:28.951
          No witnesses.

51:29.020 --> 51:32.288
     Which strongly suggests
   he's stalking his victims.

51:32.356 --> 51:33.622
       Now, he picks women
       who are vulnerable.

51:33.724 --> 51:35.091
        He studies them,

51:35.193 --> 51:36.258
         he waits until
       they're isolated...

51:36.360 --> 51:38.294
      and then he strikes.

51:38.362 --> 51:40.996
      This community needs
       to feel safe again.

51:41.065 --> 51:43.132
  These women deserve justice.

51:43.201 --> 51:45.034
       So, let's remember,
  they could be your neighbour.

51:45.136 --> 51:46.235
          Your sister.

51:46.337 --> 51:48.637
         Your daughter.

51:48.739 --> 51:50.172
Anyone else?

51:50.241 --> 51:53.075
       Alright, let's get
     back to work, everyone.

51:53.144 --> 51:55.644
      And check your shift
      assignments, please.

51:55.713 --> 51:57.746
Hey, Larry,
  have you got a sec?

51:57.849 --> 51:58.948
Yeah, what's up?

51:59.016 --> 52:01.283
I got a girl who
 has totally shut down on us.

52:01.352 --> 52:03.252
 Could you take a crack at her?

52:03.354 --> 52:04.887
- Sure.
- Thanks.

52:04.956 --> 52:06.355
Why don't
  you believe her?

52:06.424 --> 52:08.591
Well, the details
  are a bit unbelievable.

52:08.693 --> 52:11.327
  And she's just too detached.

52:11.395 --> 52:12.561
She might
   be in shock.

52:12.630 --> 52:14.630
Well, we're all
 focused on a much bigger case.

52:14.699 --> 52:17.600
   I mean... and she probably
    didn't get a fair shake.

52:17.668 --> 52:21.470
         But... you know
      99 times out of a 100

52:21.506 --> 52:25.908
the runaway just turns out to be
 a kid who stayed out all night.

52:25.977 --> 52:29.845
Maybe she's
 the one in a hundred, huh?

52:29.914 --> 52:31.981
   My God, she's just a child!

52:46.130 --> 52:47.396
Hi, Lisa.

52:47.465 --> 52:48.564
 I'm Detective Larry Pinkerton.

52:48.633 --> 52:51.967
         I'm head of the
      sex crimes unit here.

52:52.036 --> 52:54.770
    You think you can tell me
      what happened to you?

53:07.652 --> 53:11.420
       That's a picture of
       my daughter, Sarah.

53:11.489 --> 53:14.690
      I'd go to any length
         to protect her.

53:14.759 --> 53:17.359
    And I'll go to any length
         to protect you.

53:31.876 --> 53:33.242
       Tell me everything.

53:33.344 --> 53:35.578
         I believe you.

53:37.882 --> 53:38.747
Um...

53:47.858 --> 53:51.360
The car was black...

53:51.429 --> 53:55.264
  with two doors and red carpet
      and red bucket seats.

53:59.503 --> 54:01.804
        There was, um...

54:01.872 --> 54:06.242
       there was the word
   "Magnum" on the dashboard.

54:06.310 --> 54:07.943
     There was green carpet
         on the stairs.

54:08.012 --> 54:12.047
  I counted 22 steps to the top
      of the second floor.

54:12.116 --> 54:14.750
              Um...

54:14.852 --> 54:17.853
          He was white,

54:17.922 --> 54:20.422
     and he was left-handed.

54:20.491 --> 54:21.657
       There was sneakers
        in the bathroom,

54:21.759 --> 54:22.791
  with these kangaroos on them.

54:22.860 --> 54:27.029
      And his face, he had
      a thin moustache, uh,

54:27.098 --> 54:29.231
     stubble on his cheeks.

54:29.300 --> 54:31.100
     Um, his hair fell down
    in front of his forehead,

54:31.168 --> 54:34.770
        and his eyes were
     kind of close together.

54:41.279 --> 54:45.114
       He had a waterbed.

54:45.182 --> 54:46.081
She
  didn't make this up.

54:46.150 --> 54:48.050
       Her level of detail
       was extraordinary.

54:48.119 --> 54:49.852
  Now, you're gonna need to get
    her a change of clothes.

54:49.920 --> 54:51.553
     After the exam, I want
       what she's wearing

54:51.622 --> 54:53.322
- bagged for evidence.
- Okay.

54:53.391 --> 54:54.657
Now I'm gonna
  call the parents,

54:54.725 --> 54:56.458
    get consent for hypnosis

54:56.527 --> 54:58.460
     in case she's blocking
        anything crucial,

54:58.529 --> 54:59.561
        a street address.

54:59.630 --> 55:03.232
That sounds good.

55:03.301 --> 55:04.199
Yes, this
  is Lorrie McVey.

55:04.268 --> 55:05.267
   I've been on hold forever.

55:05.336 --> 55:07.770
   What happened to my sister?

55:07.872 --> 55:10.706
            She did?
         Oh, thank God!

55:10.775 --> 55:12.908
              What?

55:12.977 --> 55:15.978
           Oh, my God.

55:16.080 --> 55:19.682
              Okay.
          Yeah, thanks.

55:19.750 --> 55:22.451
            Goodbye.

55:28.893 --> 55:30.492
- Mom?
- Mm-hm?

55:30.594 --> 55:32.661
Cops said
   Lisa came back.

55:32.730 --> 55:35.431
      They said she'd been
      kidnapped and raped.

55:35.499 --> 55:38.834
Well, that's some story.

55:38.903 --> 55:42.271
She'd never make up
  something like that!

55:42.340 --> 55:44.740
Told you she'd
  turn up all right.

55:47.378 --> 55:49.712
Our psychiatrist
 is highly skilled at hypnosis.

55:49.814 --> 55:52.648
     Lisa won't be in danger
          at any time.

55:52.717 --> 55:54.883
- I'm not paying for that.
- Of course not!

55:54.952 --> 55:56.985
       He's on staff here
   with the police department.

55:57.054 --> 55:58.687
Sounds strange.

55:58.789 --> 55:59.855
   I don't want her doing it.

55:59.957 --> 56:01.523
If you'd
  just let us try--

56:01.592 --> 56:03.158
When is she coming home?

56:03.260 --> 56:07.162
     She's got chores to do!

56:07.231 --> 56:10.599
Alright, then.

56:20.911 --> 56:23.011
Yeah.

56:23.080 --> 56:26.882
     Maybe... I kind of feel
 like he would have more, um...

56:26.984 --> 56:29.385
  visible stubble on his face.

56:29.453 --> 56:30.619
Excuse me.

56:30.688 --> 56:33.222
    Can you give us a minute?

56:42.933 --> 56:45.234
I just got off
 the phone with your father.

56:45.302 --> 56:48.537
     He said no to hypnosis.

56:48.606 --> 56:50.973
        He wants to know
    when you're coming home.

56:57.615 --> 56:59.415
              Lisa,

56:59.483 --> 57:01.884
       is there something
        happening there?

57:05.689 --> 57:08.390
        You can tell me,
        I'll believe you.

57:14.231 --> 57:18.233
He's not my father.

57:18.302 --> 57:23.005
What's happening?

57:23.073 --> 57:24.840
Get off of me!

57:24.909 --> 57:26.074
Morris Elwood,
  you are under arrest

57:26.143 --> 57:27.976
         for the sexual
       assault of a minor.

57:28.045 --> 57:29.545
That's bullshit!

57:29.613 --> 57:31.246
You have
 the right to remain silent.

57:31.315 --> 57:33.215
     Anything you say or do
      can and will be used

57:33.284 --> 57:34.883
- against you in a court of law--
- The bitch is a liar!

57:34.952 --> 57:37.152
You have
  a right to an attorney.

57:37.221 --> 57:40.456
    If you cannot afford one,
  one will be appointed to you.

57:40.524 --> 57:41.423
Bullshit.

57:41.492 --> 57:42.591
Do you
  understand these rights

57:42.660 --> 57:44.092
   that have been read to you?

57:44.161 --> 57:47.062
Bitch is a liar!

58:37.882 --> 58:42.317
Why didn't you protect me?

58:59.870 --> 59:03.772
Well, this is it.

59:03.841 --> 59:05.941
  It's where you'll be staying
 'til we can find you something,

59:06.010 --> 59:09.711
            you know,
    a little more permanent.

59:09.780 --> 59:10.979
     Are you sure you don't
       have any relatives

59:11.081 --> 59:13.615
     in the Tampa area, huh?

59:13.684 --> 59:16.451
I mean, I got an
 Aunt Carol and Uncle Jim.

59:16.520 --> 59:18.787
     But they live out east
         in Titusville.

59:18.856 --> 59:20.022
I'll
  reach out to them.

59:20.090 --> 59:22.090
- Hi, Larry.
- Hey.

59:22.159 --> 59:24.159
Lisa, this is Sergeant McKinley.

59:24.228 --> 59:25.460
Call me Hannah.

59:25.529 --> 59:26.828
  I'm happy to meet you, Lisa.

59:26.897 --> 59:28.931
Yeah, well, thank you
 for letting me stay here.

59:28.999 --> 59:30.065
You can use
  my daughter's room.

59:30.167 --> 59:31.333
   She just left for college.

59:31.435 --> 59:34.002
  The house feels pretty empty!

59:34.071 --> 59:35.671
     You're gonna be dealing
     with that soon enough.

59:35.773 --> 59:37.639
Yeah.
  Don't remind me.

59:37.708 --> 59:39.007
It'll be good
  to have company again.

59:39.109 --> 59:40.175
   Want to come in for coffee?

59:40.244 --> 59:43.378
Can't.
 Got a task force meeting.

59:43.447 --> 59:44.780
      You're in good hands.

59:44.882 --> 59:46.248
- We'll talk soon.
- Alright.

59:46.317 --> 59:47.583
- Okay?
- Yep.

59:47.651 --> 59:48.951
Alright,
  let's get you settled.

59:49.019 --> 59:50.552
  Then we'll figure out dinner.

59:50.654 --> 59:53.722
     I kind of got a craving
           for pizza!

59:55.759 --> 59:58.493
These red fibres were
 found on the latest victim.

59:58.562 --> 01:00:01.129
      They're the same red
  trilobal nylon carpet fibres

01:00:01.198 --> 01:00:02.998
      that have been found
       on all the victims.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.333
Any leads
  on a manufacturer?

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:05.801
Not yet.

01:00:05.869 --> 01:00:09.171
 We're hoping at some point that
   this guy talks to someone:

01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:12.708
     a neighbour, co-worker,
   disgruntled ex-girlfriend.

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:14.142
      Or maybe someone sees
       one of these women

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:16.345
      getting into his car.

01:00:16.447 --> 01:00:17.746
       We need a witness.

01:00:17.815 --> 01:00:20.449
          Without that?

01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:03.492
- What is it?!
- No, no!

01:01:03.594 --> 01:01:08.964
It's him!

01:01:09.066 --> 01:01:11.266
           No, no, no!

01:01:11.368 --> 01:01:13.402
It's okay, Lisa.

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:18.240
- You're safe here.
- No!

01:01:18.308 --> 01:01:20.776
Have you been
  able to sleep at all?

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:24.613
I haven't slept
  since it happened.

01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:27.516
Okay.

01:01:27.584 --> 01:01:30.419
      I'm gonna set you up
  with our staff psychiatrist.

01:01:30.487 --> 01:01:34.289
   He can prescribe something
  that'll help with that, okay?

01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:43.365
Where'd you
 leave your fingerprints?

01:01:43.434 --> 01:01:45.834
In the washroom,
   there, uh...

01:01:45.903 --> 01:01:47.402
   on the mirror, then, uh...

01:01:47.471 --> 01:01:51.840
       on the towel rack,
 and then under the toilet seat.

01:01:51.909 --> 01:01:53.008
You
  leave anything else?

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:55.510
Yep, um,
  there was a hair pin

01:01:55.579 --> 01:01:59.581
     with strands of my hair
         under the bed.

01:01:59.683 --> 01:02:02.617
  I left some blood in the car.

01:02:02.686 --> 01:02:04.619
    I bit my finger, wiped it
    on the front of the seat

01:02:04.688 --> 01:02:07.255
      so he didn't see it.

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:10.192
     I don't know, I just...
      even if he killed me,

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:11.326
   I wanted him to get caught.

01:02:11.395 --> 01:02:14.229
     No one else should have
       to go through this.

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:20.268
We stopped
  at a gas station.

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:21.970
This is great, Lisa.

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:23.672
         Really helpful.

01:02:23.741 --> 01:02:25.240
So that would have been, what...

01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:28.176
      3, 4 in the morning?

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:30.212
We left his
 apartment at 3:13, so yeah,

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.414
    it would have been about
     20 minutes after that.

01:02:32.516 --> 01:02:34.716
What do
  you recall about him?

01:02:37.521 --> 01:02:39.821
He said he wanted
  to get back at women.

01:02:41.892 --> 01:02:43.725
     Said we're all bitches.

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:44.726
        And he was clean.

01:02:44.828 --> 01:02:46.361
      He was really clean.
        He smelled clean.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:48.930
  His bathroom was clean, um...

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:50.966
 and he washed me in the shower.

01:02:51.068 --> 01:02:52.367
            And he...

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:56.371
Listen,
 we don't have to continue

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.174
- if you want to stop.
- It's okay.

01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:01.243
  He was really thorough and he
   seemed to mean a lot to him

01:03:01.345 --> 01:03:04.112
        that I was clean.

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:13.722
I think I saw
   his car before.

01:03:13.824 --> 01:03:15.690
That night?

01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:20.295
Before that.

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:37.879
What if Lisa McVey's
 rapist is our serial killer?

01:03:37.948 --> 01:03:39.848
    Hear me out, Lieutenant.

01:03:39.917 --> 01:03:41.950
     She was taken at night
       when she was alone.

01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:43.418
         He stalked her.
         He tied her up.

01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:45.353
  He took her away in his car.

01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:46.888
That's not enough.

01:03:46.924 --> 01:03:49.057
He told her that
 he wanted to get back at women.

01:03:49.126 --> 01:03:50.492
      He fits the profile.

01:03:50.561 --> 01:03:52.627
Yeah, but our guy
 doesn't let his victims go.

01:03:52.696 --> 01:03:53.895
This
  kid is brilliant!

01:03:53.964 --> 01:03:55.363
      She's brave as hell.

01:03:55.432 --> 01:03:57.966
     She's survived abusive
   situations her whole life.

01:03:58.068 --> 01:03:59.968
        She's got skills
        like no one else!

01:04:00.037 --> 01:04:02.771
      Now, what if she did
     what no one else could?

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:06.608
     Got him to let her go.

01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:08.376
I just don't see it.

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:10.078
I want to send
 her clothes to the FBI lab

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.346
         for processing.

01:04:11.415 --> 01:04:13.114
Our resources are
 stretched thin enough as it is.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:14.382
     I can't authorize that.

01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:16.418
Take it out
  of my budget, then.

01:04:20.724 --> 01:04:22.891
Hey, Serge.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.093
     If it is the same guy,

01:04:25.162 --> 01:04:26.695
          then he knows
        that she's alive,

01:04:26.763 --> 01:04:30.498
   then he's got a loose end.

01:04:57.728 --> 01:05:01.696
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:05:01.765 --> 01:05:03.465
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:05.400
            Nothing.
            I, uh...

01:05:05.469 --> 01:05:07.636
      Just here to move you
        to the new place.

01:05:07.738 --> 01:05:10.705
- We gotta go.
- Okay.

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:18.013
So, this is it.

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:19.981
  It's a safe house for minors
     in the justice system.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:21.349
         I'll take that.

01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:22.751
      You'll be okay here.

01:05:22.819 --> 01:05:25.921
    Might even find some kids
      your age to talk to.

01:05:31.423 --> 01:05:33.223
             Lisa...

01:05:33.291 --> 01:05:35.625
  I'm gonna need you to lay low
    for a little while, okay?

01:05:35.694 --> 01:05:37.127
       That means no going
      to the usual haunts.

01:05:37.229 --> 01:05:39.829
  No shifts at the donut shop.

01:05:39.898 --> 01:05:42.432
           Just be for
      a little while, okay?

01:05:42.501 --> 01:05:44.767
- Okay.
- It's just up here.

01:06:13.031 --> 01:06:14.731
Lisa, this is
  my daughter, Sarah.

01:06:14.799 --> 01:06:15.832
Nice to meet you, Lisa.

01:06:15.901 --> 01:06:18.701
Hi, yeah,
  nice to meet you, too.

01:06:18.803 --> 01:06:22.805
Keys?
 PINKERTON:

01:06:22.874 --> 01:06:24.507
          Speed limit.

01:06:24.609 --> 01:06:26.309
Sure thing.

01:06:26.378 --> 01:06:29.145
- Buckle up.
- Okay.

01:06:33.418 --> 01:06:35.952
You got it, okay?

01:06:36.021 --> 01:06:38.688
  And you keep speeding up and
  slowing down and speeding up.

01:06:38.757 --> 01:06:39.756
      You got a lead foot.

01:06:39.824 --> 01:06:41.257
Look who's talking,
   Dale Earnhardt.

01:06:41.326 --> 01:06:42.859
I'm a professional
   police officer.

01:06:42.928 --> 01:06:44.561
      I drive for a living.
              Keys.

01:06:47.199 --> 01:06:50.433
A donut shop?
   How cool.

01:06:50.535 --> 01:06:53.269
Oh...
    Yeah.

01:06:53.338 --> 01:06:54.237
      No, it's a great job.

01:06:54.306 --> 01:06:57.340
         And my boss is
     really cool too, so...

01:06:57.442 --> 01:06:59.409
I would be so fat
  if I worked there!

01:06:59.477 --> 01:07:01.578
Yeah,
I was worried about that, but...

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.479
But you're so thin.

01:07:03.548 --> 01:07:06.449
Well, that's because
 I only eat the donut holes.

01:07:06.518 --> 01:07:08.484
    So doesn't really count.

01:07:08.553 --> 01:07:11.955
Sarah's got
 a part-time job at Waldenbooks.

01:07:12.057 --> 01:07:14.190
Yeah, I just love
 being surrounded by books.

01:07:14.259 --> 01:07:16.926
Oh, cool, nice.
 That sounds like a great job.

01:07:16.995 --> 01:07:20.763
Her boss says
 that she is his best employee.

01:07:25.604 --> 01:07:28.338
  Just never take her driving.

01:07:32.811 --> 01:07:34.244
Now, these
 tread marks are consistent

01:07:34.346 --> 01:07:36.145
        with every one of
        the crime scenes.

01:07:36.214 --> 01:07:39.849
   We need to check it against
 the tire to determine the make.

01:07:39.951 --> 01:07:41.084
           Talk to me.

01:07:41.152 --> 01:07:43.419
The lab found
 red fibres on Lisa's clothes.

01:07:43.488 --> 01:07:46.923
They match the red carpet fibres
    we found on all our vics.

01:07:48.994 --> 01:07:52.228
We have
   another victim.

01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:55.131
        And she's alive.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.434
       We have a witness.

01:07:58.503 --> 01:08:00.303
 Let me tell you about a strong,

01:08:00.405 --> 01:08:03.139
  brave, brilliant young girl:

01:08:03.208 --> 01:08:06.276
          Lisa McVey...

01:08:06.344 --> 01:08:09.545
     And our serial killer.

01:08:11.483 --> 01:08:13.249
Lisa...

01:08:13.318 --> 01:08:14.417
       I want to take you
        back to the place

01:08:14.486 --> 01:08:15.885
    where you were abducted.

01:08:15.987 --> 01:08:17.720
 Retrace your steps from there.

01:08:17.788 --> 01:08:19.389
What, you mean
 go back on the car ride?

01:08:19.491 --> 01:08:22.692
Look...

01:08:22.794 --> 01:08:24.193
   I think your amazing recall

01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:28.965
  may be the key to finding out
   where your attacker lives.

01:08:29.033 --> 01:08:32.335
Has something changed?

01:08:32.404 --> 01:08:33.903
The man who hurt you

01:08:33.971 --> 01:08:37.540
   is responsible for hurting
 a lot of other people as well.

01:08:40.412 --> 01:08:42.278
He's the killer that
  everyone's looking for,

01:08:42.346 --> 01:08:45.581
            isn't he?

01:08:45.649 --> 01:08:48.117
We think so.

01:08:52.057 --> 01:08:54.122
         You know what,
    maybe this is a bad idea.

01:08:54.225 --> 01:08:56.292
I'll do it.

01:08:56.361 --> 01:08:59.629
So after he
  took you to his car,

01:08:59.698 --> 01:09:03.099
     any chance you remember
    which direction you went?

01:09:11.376 --> 01:09:15.978
I think...
   oh, I think...

01:09:22.087 --> 01:09:23.886
I don't remember.

01:09:23.955 --> 01:09:25.020
- Hey, hey...
- I don't...

01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:26.189
Lisa,
 if you're not up for this,

01:09:26.256 --> 01:09:27.890
- you don't have to do it, okay?
- No, I am.

01:09:27.992 --> 01:09:29.125
     I want to nail the guy!

01:09:29.227 --> 01:09:31.194
      I want to catch him.
            I just...

01:09:31.296 --> 01:09:32.528
Alright.

01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:33.662
    Look, look, listen to me.

01:09:33.765 --> 01:09:35.732
        Calm down, okay?

01:09:35.834 --> 01:09:38.501
        Close your eyes.

01:09:38.569 --> 01:09:40.837
        Clear your head.

01:09:40.904 --> 01:09:44.707
    And go back to that day.

01:09:44.809 --> 01:09:48.243
         Take your time.

01:09:48.345 --> 01:09:51.346
        What do you see?

01:09:58.523 --> 01:10:03.326
The car
  was facing north...

01:10:03.395 --> 01:10:06.162
   and he took off down Rome.

01:10:06.231 --> 01:10:10.600
        And then he, uh,
     took a right on Sligh.

01:10:14.506 --> 01:10:15.872
You're gonna want to wait
 for three traffic lights,

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:18.841
      three traffic lights.
         And thank you.

01:10:18.943 --> 01:10:20.176
           Turn left.
           Turn left.

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.314
There should be
 an interstate right here.

01:10:31.055 --> 01:10:33.689
You're gonna
  want to be facing east.

01:10:51.810 --> 01:10:54.610
You're doing great.

01:11:06.491 --> 01:11:08.157
Hey...

01:11:08.226 --> 01:11:09.659
Where's she going?

01:11:09.761 --> 01:11:11.761
Hey!

01:11:11.863 --> 01:11:13.296
Hey!

01:11:17.202 --> 01:11:19.101
Lisa!

01:11:19.204 --> 01:11:20.470
              Hey!

01:11:40.859 --> 01:11:43.292
The second I
  took off my blindfold,

01:11:43.394 --> 01:11:45.628
        I saw this tree.

01:11:49.033 --> 01:11:51.968
          And I knew...

01:11:52.036 --> 01:11:55.771
     that I was gonna live.

01:11:57.942 --> 01:11:59.842
        I was gonna live.

01:11:59.911 --> 01:12:02.378
She's given us
  a two-mile radius.

01:12:02.447 --> 01:12:05.681
     Let's put the word out
   and coordinate with patrol.

01:12:05.783 --> 01:12:07.283
          We're close.

01:12:07.352 --> 01:12:08.918
Listen up, people.

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:12.255
       We have a suspect.

01:12:27.338 --> 01:12:29.205
Hey.

01:12:29.307 --> 01:12:30.373
    From the vending machine.

01:12:30.475 --> 01:12:33.976
Oh...
    Thanks.

01:12:34.045 --> 01:12:35.244
Listen, I'd
  feel a whole lot better

01:12:35.313 --> 01:12:38.915
   if you'd stick around here
 at least until we get this guy.

01:12:38.983 --> 01:12:40.883
Well...

01:12:40.952 --> 01:12:43.953
      you keep bringin' me
   gourmet meals like this...

01:13:23.761 --> 01:13:25.461
Detective Wolf,
  this is command post.

01:13:25.563 --> 01:13:27.063
         What's your 20?

01:13:27.131 --> 01:13:29.699
Barker Boulevard,
  red light district.

01:13:29.767 --> 01:13:32.401
      Taking one last sweep
      before heading back.

01:13:32.503 --> 01:13:35.504
Copy that.

01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:47.817
Holy shit.

01:14:01.833 --> 01:14:05.034
You gonna be
  my lucky girl tonight.

01:14:10.208 --> 01:14:11.407
Good evening, sir.

01:14:11.476 --> 01:14:14.910
      Sorry to bother you.
   I'm Detective Charlie Wolf.

01:14:14.979 --> 01:14:16.679
Is there
  a problem, officer?

01:14:16.748 --> 01:14:18.547
Yeah, you know, I just got
 a call on an armed robbery

01:14:18.650 --> 01:14:20.983
       out on the west end
       of town, and, uh...

01:14:21.052 --> 01:14:23.352
          made off with
        a lot of jewelry.

01:14:23.421 --> 01:14:25.488
     Description of the car
         matches yours.

01:14:25.556 --> 01:14:26.856
Yeah,
  well, it wasn't me.

01:14:26.924 --> 01:14:28.824
      I haven't been on the
    west side all week, so...

01:14:28.926 --> 01:14:30.359
Yeah.

01:14:30.428 --> 01:14:31.560
         Look, I'm real
        sorry about this.

01:14:31.629 --> 01:14:33.829
    My boss is gonna kill me
       if I come up empty.

01:14:33.898 --> 01:14:35.364
          You mind if I
      search your vehicle,

01:14:35.466 --> 01:14:38.501
      just to rule you out?

01:14:38.603 --> 01:14:41.404
Yeah, no.

01:14:41.472 --> 01:14:44.073
Okay.

01:14:44.142 --> 01:14:45.808
           Well, hey,
      how about I just, uh,

01:14:45.877 --> 01:14:47.343
   snap a quick picture, then?

01:14:47.412 --> 01:14:48.644
   A photo of you and the car,

01:14:48.713 --> 01:14:53.449
   so the victim can tell us,
    you know, it wasn't you?

01:14:53.551 --> 01:14:54.984
Yeah, okay.

01:14:55.053 --> 01:14:57.820
Thanks.
  I'll be right back.

01:15:19.911 --> 01:15:21.010
Thanks.
  I appreciate that.

01:15:21.079 --> 01:15:24.246
Anything
 I can do to help, officer.

01:15:24.315 --> 01:15:27.917
Have a good night.

01:15:38.095 --> 01:15:40.529
Command post,
  this is Detective Wolf.

01:15:40.598 --> 01:15:43.665
        I have a suspect
   within the two-mile radius.

01:15:53.277 --> 01:15:55.277
Hello?

01:15:55.379 --> 01:15:56.345
You liar!

01:16:02.253 --> 01:16:04.620
Hey!
    Lisa!

01:16:04.722 --> 01:16:06.121
         Hey, hey, hey.

01:16:06.190 --> 01:16:07.923
            Wake up.
            Wake up.

01:16:08.025 --> 01:16:10.125
   You're having a bad dream.

01:16:10.227 --> 01:16:13.762
            Wake up.
           It's okay.

01:16:13.831 --> 01:16:16.398
      The entire task force
          is out there

01:16:16.467 --> 01:16:17.733
      looking for this guy.

01:16:17.802 --> 01:16:20.302
   We're gonna get him, okay?

01:16:20.404 --> 01:16:23.338
           It's okay.
     He can't get you here.

01:16:35.186 --> 01:16:37.719
Command post,
  this is Detective Wolf.

01:16:37.788 --> 01:16:39.121
Detective Wolf,
  this is command post.

01:16:39.223 --> 01:16:40.622
            Go ahead.

01:16:40.691 --> 01:16:43.058
I need you to run a tag
 for a black Dodge Magnum.

01:16:43.127 --> 01:16:44.159
         Florida plates.

01:16:44.228 --> 01:16:48.297
      Juliet Whiskey Hotel
             4-8-0.

01:16:48.399 --> 01:16:49.798
Black Dodge Magnum.

01:16:49.867 --> 01:16:53.202
      Juliet Whiskey Hotel
             4-8-0.

01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:55.637
Pull everything
 connected to those plates.

01:16:55.706 --> 01:16:58.674
Standby.

01:17:04.148 --> 01:17:08.383
Take as
  much time as you need.

01:17:08.486 --> 01:17:11.620
        Take a good look.

01:17:20.564 --> 01:17:22.598
That's him.

01:17:22.666 --> 01:17:24.666
You sure?

01:17:24.735 --> 01:17:28.437
Yeah.

01:17:28.506 --> 01:17:31.573
         Yeah, I'm sure.

01:17:31.642 --> 01:17:35.410
           That's him.
           That's him.

01:17:49.718 --> 01:17:51.251
Don't move!

01:17:51.353 --> 01:17:54.388
             Freeze!
       Down on your knees!

01:17:54.490 --> 01:17:55.989
Hands above your head!

01:17:56.091 --> 01:17:57.891
     Hands behind your head!

01:17:57.993 --> 01:18:02.763
         Bobby Joe Long,
      you are under arrest.

01:18:36.565 --> 01:18:38.732
Green carpet
   and 22 stairs.

01:18:38.834 --> 01:18:41.201
       Just like she said.

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.407
Thank you.

01:18:56.885 --> 01:18:59.820
That's a good one.

01:19:15.971 --> 01:19:19.106
You're
  gonna fry for this.

01:19:21.076 --> 01:19:24.211
There's something
 wrong with me, I know that.

01:19:29.451 --> 01:19:33.620
  The only reason you caught me
    is because I let her go.

01:19:33.722 --> 01:19:36.623
Is that what you think?

01:19:41.196 --> 01:19:44.865
She was different
 from the others, you know?

01:19:44.967 --> 01:19:46.900
              Yeah.

01:19:50.639 --> 01:19:54.407
She was
  something special.

01:20:05.754 --> 01:20:08.321
Lisa?

01:20:08.423 --> 01:20:10.123
              Hey.

01:20:14.062 --> 01:20:17.197
           We got him.

01:20:17.299 --> 01:20:19.366
- What?
- We got him.

01:20:19.468 --> 01:20:22.202
         Your attacker.
       Our serial killer.

01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:34.414
Why did I live?

01:20:34.516 --> 01:20:36.883
- Hey...
- I shouldn't have lived.

01:20:36.985 --> 01:20:40.153
Lisa, do you not
 realize what you've done?

01:20:40.255 --> 01:20:42.689
      You stopped a killer.

01:20:42.791 --> 01:20:45.392
        You managed to do
           in 12 days

01:20:45.494 --> 01:20:48.328
        what we couldn't
    accomplish in six months!

01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:53.133
  You have saved so many lives.

01:20:53.235 --> 01:20:54.834
         It's all over.

01:20:54.937 --> 01:20:58.672
       You're a hero, kid.

01:21:04.846 --> 01:21:08.448
           It's okay.

01:21:43.652 --> 01:21:46.253
Hello?

01:21:46.355 --> 01:21:47.220
Hey, Lorrie.

01:21:47.322 --> 01:21:48.421
Where have you been?

01:21:48.523 --> 01:21:50.357
      I've been so worried,
  and I was calling Grandma...

01:21:50.459 --> 01:21:51.691
I know, I know.
   I know, sis.

01:21:51.793 --> 01:21:53.059
           I'm sorry.
          I'm so sorry.

01:21:53.161 --> 01:21:54.461
Who is it?

01:21:54.563 --> 01:21:55.462
It's Lisa.

01:21:55.564 --> 01:21:57.597
What does <i> she</i> want?

01:21:57.699 --> 01:21:59.899
So, where were you?

01:22:00.002 --> 01:22:02.969
         What happened?

01:22:03.071 --> 01:22:06.239
Um...

01:22:06.341 --> 01:22:08.108
      Listen, um, I forgot

01:22:08.210 --> 01:22:10.443
   that I have to go back down
      to the police station

01:22:10.545 --> 01:22:12.078
    to talk to the detective.
             Sorry.

01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:13.813
No, not
  until you tell me.

01:22:13.915 --> 01:22:15.081
I know,
   I will, okay?

01:22:15.183 --> 01:22:16.416
      I'll call you later.

01:22:16.518 --> 01:22:17.651
              Okay?
           I promise.

01:22:17.753 --> 01:22:20.687
Oh, you better!

01:22:23.859 --> 01:22:28.094
Hey, Lorrie?

01:22:28.196 --> 01:22:31.965
  Thank you for caring so much.

01:22:32.067 --> 01:22:35.669
        I mean, it really
       means a lot to me.

01:23:56.084 --> 01:23:57.484
You know I said
 you were one in a hundred?

01:23:57.586 --> 01:24:01.788
    You're one in a million.

01:24:01.890 --> 01:24:04.791
 I want you to go have that life
     you fought so hard for.

01:24:07.462 --> 01:24:08.995
   You know I've been thinking
     about maybe having you

01:24:09.097 --> 01:24:12.365
    come live with my family.

01:24:15.036 --> 01:24:16.236
Thank you.

01:24:16.338 --> 01:24:18.304
             But...

01:24:18.407 --> 01:24:21.207
    I mean, you've gotta keep
   this stuff separate, right?

01:24:21.309 --> 01:24:23.710
          Work's work.
          Home's home.

01:24:23.812 --> 01:24:25.245
  You'd never get a break from
    what happens on the job.

01:24:25.347 --> 01:24:27.781
  It would just swallow you up.

01:24:36.558 --> 01:24:38.425
Hi.

01:24:38.527 --> 01:24:43.029
Hi, sweetie.

01:24:43.131 --> 01:24:44.864
       Let me look at you.

01:24:44.966 --> 01:24:47.867
We had no idea what was going on
  at your grandmother's house.

01:24:47.969 --> 01:24:49.869
- Please forgive us.
- It's okay.

01:24:49.971 --> 01:24:50.937
We're gonna
  take good care of you.

01:24:51.039 --> 01:24:52.806
- We promise!
- I know.

01:24:52.908 --> 01:24:56.743
             I know.

01:24:56.845 --> 01:24:57.744
Larry Pinkerton.

01:24:57.846 --> 01:24:59.446
Jim.
   Thank you.

01:24:59.548 --> 01:25:01.648
Carol.

01:25:09.257 --> 01:25:11.357
Thank you
  for believing me.

01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:15.695
Hey,
  we owe you everything.

01:25:19.501 --> 01:25:22.368
Come on,
   let's go.

01:25:29.644 --> 01:25:31.544
You haven't
  seen the last of me.

01:25:31.646 --> 01:25:35.548
I hope not!

01:25:55.303 --> 01:25:58.905
<i> Dear Mom,</i>

01:25:59.007 --> 01:26:03.209
     <i> you once told me that</i>
 <i> I'd never have a better life.</i>

01:26:05.714 --> 01:26:08.681
        <i> You were wrong.</i>

01:26:08.783 --> 01:26:11.518
           <i> Good-bye.</i>

01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:14.687
             <i> Lisa.</i>
