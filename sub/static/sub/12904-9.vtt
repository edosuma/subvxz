half a wardrobe there.

10:17.464 --> 10:20.099
We... We just got you back on track
after your whole bagel incident,

10:20.133 --> 10:21.567
and now you're pulling this crap?

10:21.601 --> 10:23.572
They wanted me to say something like,

10:23.592 --> 10:25.402
"This makeup can change your life.

10:25.422 --> 10:27.796
"It changed mine." I can't do that.

10:27.830 --> 10:29.798
Okay, well, then, honey,
we ask for a rewrite.

10:29.832 --> 10:31.699
Jackie says the beauty
industry makes women

10:31.734 --> 10:33.535
feel bad about themselves
so that they can keep

10:33.569 --> 10:35.069
selling them things
that they don't need.

10:35.104 --> 10:36.805
Okay, that's great,
but I'm not sure that Jackie

10:36.839 --> 10:38.273
should be giving you career advice.

10:38.307 --> 10:40.041
And I didn't even know
you were going to Impact.

10:40.075 --> 10:42.361
Yeah, we go at different times.

10:42.381 --> 10:43.945
Though I'm thinking about
starting two-a-days.

10:43.979 --> 10:46.080
Whoa, hey, stop...

10:46.115 --> 10:47.615
Is that from class?

10:47.650 --> 10:49.083
I think it looks kind of badass.

10:49.118 --> 10:50.985
Jackie said that you
had one just like it.

10:51.020 --> 10:52.654
Yeah, well, I was, like, five
months in, and you just started.

10:52.688 --> 10:54.455
No, Stacey, that...
That looks really bad.

10:54.490 --> 10:55.790
Listen, I think
you should pause on class,

10:55.825 --> 10:58.382
- at least until that heals.
- Are you kidding?

10:58.402 --> 11:00.395
This is the most empowered
I've ever felt.

11:00.429 --> 11:01.596
Great, and I'm totally
on board with that,

11:01.630 --> 11:03.731
but let's not forget the bigger
picture here... your career.

11:03.766 --> 11:05.266
Okay, I have P.R. set up
for you, little lady,

11:05.301 --> 11:06.634
for the next three weeks
that you can't do

11:06.669 --> 11:07.936
if you look like an MMA fighter.

11:07.970 --> 11:10.939
- Who lost.
- That's why God invented Photoshop.

11:10.973 --> 11:12.774
Stop acting like my grandma.

11:12.808 --> 11:15.936
Besides, you're the one who
suggested the class to begin with.

11:15.956 --> 11:17.257
Yeah...

11:17.291 --> 11:20.093
Do you have anything
to drink around here?

11:24.932 --> 11:27.565
I'm about to head out.
Do you need anything before I go?

11:27.585 --> 11:30.053
No. Have a nice night.

11:30.088 --> 11:32.089
Are you sure you don't want to talk?

11:32.123 --> 11:33.657
I'm... I'm not in any rush.

11:33.691 --> 11:35.025
I'll pour some wine.

11:36.828 --> 11:38.829
All right, twist my arm.

11:38.863 --> 11:41.156
Okay, so, what's going on?

11:41.176 --> 11:42.966
Is this about your ex getting married?

11:43.001 --> 11:46.553
[Sighs] It's stupid that it
bugs me, I know.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.939
I mean, it's not stupid.

11:48.973 --> 11:49.973
I just wish I didn't care.

11:50.008 --> 11:51.942
I have a beautiful daughter

11:51.976 --> 11:53.310
and an amazing life, really.

11:53.344 --> 11:55.599
Do you still love him? - No.

11:55.619 --> 11:57.647
Just in a nostalgic way.

11:57.682 --> 12:00.584
I guess I'm feeling a little lonely.

12:00.618 --> 12:02.626
This is why social media is evil.

12:02.646 --> 12:05.355
[Chuckles] Well, any guy
would be lucky to have you.

12:06.417 --> 12:08.423
That's sweet of you to say.

12:08.443 --> 12:09.659
If you can't land a good guy,

12:09.694 --> 12:11.361
there's no hope for the rest of us.

12:11.396 --> 12:13.126
[Chuckles] Don't be silly.

12:13.372 --> 12:17.667
What is happening with you? Did you
take my advice about online dating?

12:17.702 --> 12:19.669
Um, I've chatted with a few guys.

12:19.704 --> 12:21.872
Ooh. Anyone promising?

12:22.648 --> 12:24.432
- There's one.
- How exciting.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.043
Have you gone out with him yet?

12:26.077 --> 12:28.879
No. No, no, no. I'm... I'm too shy.

12:28.913 --> 12:30.514
The thought of meeting him in person

12:30.548 --> 12:31.848
makes me really uncomfortable.

12:31.883 --> 12:33.850
I mean, I know it sounds strange,

12:33.885 --> 12:35.852
but getting to know him online just...

12:35.887 --> 12:37.320
feels safer.

12:37.355 --> 12:40.057
That doesn't sound strange at all.

12:40.091 --> 12:40.991
[Baby crying]

12:41.025 --> 12:42.159
Oh, I'll take this.

12:42.193 --> 12:43.894
You have a great night.

12:43.928 --> 12:46.696
Oh, I think I'm gonna write
from here tomorrow morning,

12:46.731 --> 12:48.899
so you can start a little later.

12:48.933 --> 12:50.500
Around noon?

12:50.535 --> 12:52.235
Oh, okay.

12:52.270 --> 12:53.904
Oh, wait.

12:53.938 --> 12:55.539
I forgot, I have spin class
in the morning.

12:55.573 --> 12:57.140
So I'll just see you at the usual time.

12:57.175 --> 12:58.208
Good night.

12:58.242 --> 13:01.066
[Crying continues]

13:01.163 --> 13:02.546
Kate: Is Panorama City nice?

13:02.580 --> 13:04.815
Randy: Perfectly nice... if you
want to be murdered.

13:04.849 --> 13:08.552
Okay. How about...

13:08.586 --> 13:09.753
Eagle Rock?

13:09.787 --> 13:12.597
Sure, if you want to live
with ex-hippies and breeders.

13:12.617 --> 13:15.225
I love dogs. I meant straight people.

13:15.259 --> 13:17.527
Have you really thought this through?

13:17.562 --> 13:19.529
Going from Harry and Joss to this?

13:19.564 --> 13:22.332
It's like trading in the
penthouse for the outhouse.

13:22.366 --> 13:23.900
You have it made.

13:23.935 --> 13:26.436
There's also something to be
said for being independent.

13:26.471 --> 13:28.438
But things are weird at home.

13:28.473 --> 13:29.940
What? Weird how?

13:29.974 --> 13:32.576
Something feels off.

13:32.610 --> 13:34.544
Harry and I have always been so close,

13:34.579 --> 13:36.580
and now there's this little...

13:36.614 --> 13:38.615
distance.

13:38.649 --> 13:42.085
I think a bit of space will help us.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.354
Will you come with me to look
at places tomorrow?

13:44.388 --> 13:46.223
- What about work?
- We can go after.

13:46.257 --> 13:47.958
Since when do you care
so much about work?

13:47.992 --> 13:49.926
I don't. I just didn't want to
tell you it sounded boring.

13:49.961 --> 13:52.095
Maybe there will be some cute
gay real-estate agents there.

13:52.130 --> 13:55.298
[Sighs] Why do I let you do this to me?

13:55.333 --> 13:57.033
But we're gonna have to get
a few drinks beforehand.

13:57.068 --> 13:58.535
Ha! Perfect! Drinks on me.

13:58.569 --> 14:01.104
- Ooh, that sounds way less boring.
- Whoo!

14:04.010 --> 14:05.947
Okay, you guys, you ready to go?!

14:05.981 --> 14:07.949
- [Cheers and applause]
- Come on.

14:07.983 --> 14:10.151
Bring your hands down
to the middle bar right here.

14:11.119 --> 14:12.253
Start to accelerate.

14:12.287 --> 14:13.654
Take a deep breath in.

14:13.689 --> 14:15.690
As you exhale, I want you
to pick up those legs.

14:15.724 --> 14:18.993
There you go. I want you to add
one more turn on that wheel.

14:19.027 --> 14:20.161
There it is.

14:20.195 --> 14:23.297
In four, three, two.

14:23.332 --> 14:25.199
Come up out of the saddle
and let's drive it.

14:25.234 --> 14:26.801
Pick up those legs. Yes, give me more.

14:26.835 --> 14:28.169
Come on.

14:28.203 --> 14:30.438
â™ª Everything they wanna be â™ª

14:30.472 --> 14:31.639
You have eight more counts.

14:31.673 --> 14:34.108
I want you to add a touch
while we're up here. Come on.

14:34.142 --> 14:35.843
Before you're ready. There it is.

14:35.878 --> 14:37.879
Stay with me. Let it go.

14:37.913 --> 14:39.847
Give yourselves a big round of applause.

14:39.882 --> 14:42.450
[Cheers and applause]

14:44.086 --> 14:45.620
When you said we were going shopping,

14:45.654 --> 14:46.687
I assumed you meant for food.

14:46.722 --> 14:47.989
Well, it's Jonathan's idea.

14:48.023 --> 14:49.490
Got some events coming up,

14:49.524 --> 14:51.559
and he thinks I need to upgrade my look.

14:51.593 --> 14:52.894
[Scoffs] Why?

14:52.928 --> 14:54.495
Your, uh... Your look is fine.

14:54.529 --> 14:55.897
[Chuckles]

14:55.931 --> 14:57.965
Says the boy with the cliched
rock T-shirt.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.534
What are you doing?

15:00.569 --> 15:02.837
I'll be right back.

15:02.871 --> 15:05.640
[Scoffs] Love that guy.

15:05.674 --> 15:07.742
How's things with April's mum?

15:07.776 --> 15:10.578
She staying sober? That's what she says.

15:10.612 --> 15:13.347
Hey, so, I tell you she wants
to give us 30,000 bucks?

15:13.382 --> 15:15.383
- For your liver?
- What?

15:15.417 --> 15:16.984
No, to help pay down the
principal on our mortgage.

15:17.019 --> 15:18.653
- Wow, that's nice of her.
- Is it?

15:18.687 --> 15:20.855
Or is it passive aggressive and evil?

15:20.889 --> 15:22.490
She's trying to outdo me, obviously.

15:22.524 --> 15:24.425
She already told me she wants me
out of the house,

15:24.459 --> 15:25.633
and this is her way of moving in.

15:25.653 --> 15:28.288
Well, maybe she's just trying to do
something nice for her daughter.

15:28.322 --> 15:30.357
That's how she's selling it,
but I'm not buying it.

15:30.391 --> 15:32.859
You don't have to buy it, mate.
You just have to cash the check.

15:32.893 --> 15:34.127
If you love April...

15:34.161 --> 15:35.629
This isn't about my love for April.

15:35.663 --> 15:38.513
It's about my hatred for April's mother.

15:38.633 --> 15:41.201
I like this one. It's buttery.

15:41.235 --> 15:42.636
In the fashion world,

15:42.670 --> 15:45.405
we don't use condiments
to describe clothing.

15:45.439 --> 15:48.108
- Noted.
- Are you kidding me? It's $2,700.

15:48.142 --> 15:50.210
It's a bargain, I know.

15:50.244 --> 15:52.979
Jonathan's paying for it. You know
what, get yourself something.

15:53.014 --> 15:54.264
He won't even notice.

15:54.284 --> 15:56.288
Maybe I'll just have Marjorie
get me one.

15:56.308 --> 15:57.817
[Chuckling] Don't be an ass.

15:57.852 --> 15:59.052
Yeah, whatever, man.

15:59.086 --> 16:01.735
You know, enjoy your shopping spree.

16:06.943 --> 16:09.707
I know I'm taking a risk,
but I just wanted to say hello.

16:09.727 --> 16:10.860
Hi?

16:10.894 --> 16:12.595
Hi.

16:12.629 --> 16:14.364
Have... we met?

16:14.398 --> 16:17.600
Uh, w-well, not yet.

16:17.634 --> 16:19.303
I'm Adam.

16:20.007 --> 16:21.037
Karen. Nice to meet you.

16:21.071 --> 16:23.072
That was some impressive
cycling in there.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.741
I was struggling to keep up.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.242
Your first time in the class?

16:26.276 --> 16:27.910
Yeah. I, uh, heard it was a good one.

16:29.449 --> 16:32.515
Look, I know this is a little strange
'cause we just met and I'm all sweaty,

16:32.549 --> 16:35.152
but I'd love to take you
to lunch sometime.

16:35.574 --> 16:37.887
Maybe Alimento?

16:39.143 --> 16:42.276
- That's my favorite place.
- So, can I call you?

16:43.183 --> 16:46.231
Uh, why don't you give me your
number and I'll call you?

16:46.847 --> 16:48.240
Sounds good.

16:48.260 --> 16:50.528
I look forward to chatting later.

16:50.562 --> 16:52.563
Okay.

16:52.598 --> 16:54.365
[Dishes clinking]

16:59.938 --> 17:01.667
Hope you're hungry.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.374
Brought hot wings with extra ranch.

17:03.409 --> 17:04.409
What's the occasion?

17:04.443 --> 17:06.243
This is my mea culpa.

17:06.278 --> 17:08.846
Mm. That Latin for lunch?

17:08.881 --> 17:10.080
[Chuckles] Close. It's more like,

17:10.115 --> 17:12.450
uh, sorry for being an ass earlier.

17:12.483 --> 17:14.385
Clearly I'm not someone who can shop

17:14.420 --> 17:16.788
and carry on a meaningful
conversation at the same time.

17:16.821 --> 17:19.376
Well, don't sweat it. It wasn't all you.

17:19.396 --> 17:21.063
It was kind of childish of me
to walk out like that.

17:21.097 --> 17:22.998
The whole thing just
kind of hit a nerve.

17:23.032 --> 17:24.566
Oh, yeah, right. Clothing issues?

17:24.601 --> 17:27.069
- Yeah, funny.
- No, look, I'm... I'm really thrilled

17:27.103 --> 17:28.588
that you're doing so well...
I really am.

17:28.608 --> 17:29.805
It's just that the whole thing

17:29.839 --> 17:31.640
kind of shined a light
on how broke I am,

17:31.675 --> 17:34.143
and April's mom already
shined a giant spotlight

17:34.177 --> 17:35.911
on that, so I overreacted.

17:35.945 --> 17:37.913
Oof. Marjorie's not into the band, huh?

17:37.947 --> 17:40.182
- Surprising, huh?
- Yeah.

17:40.216 --> 17:43.419
Well, mate, I'm sure if you have an
adult conversation with April about it,

17:43.453 --> 17:45.054
she'll understand where
you're coming from, right?

17:45.088 --> 17:47.189
Yeah, that's the thing,
I'm not great at adult conversation.

17:47.223 --> 17:48.557
Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're right.

17:48.591 --> 17:49.758
You're not at all.

17:49.793 --> 17:51.927
- Do you want me to do it?
- Mothers love me.

17:51.961 --> 17:54.530
Except for Joss' mum. She's...

17:55.757 --> 17:57.419
You know, I think I'm good.

17:58.968 --> 18:00.002
Dig in.

18:00.036 --> 18:02.838
- [Bell jingles]
- I have a dilemma.

18:02.872 --> 18:04.406
I have a dilemma.

18:04.441 --> 18:06.208
I met a gorgeous guy at spin class,

18:06.242 --> 18:07.910
and he gave me his number.

18:07.944 --> 18:10.045
I don't know if I should
call him or not.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.413
Honey, that's not a dilemma.

18:11.448 --> 18:12.948
That's the start of a Meg Ryan movie.

18:12.982 --> 18:14.183
Was there a spark?

18:14.217 --> 18:16.018
I guess, but I know nothing about him

18:16.052 --> 18:18.020
except he sweats a lot less than me.

18:18.054 --> 18:19.188
- Ooh.
- Thank you.

18:19.222 --> 18:20.756
What's the big deal with calling?

18:20.790 --> 18:23.696
You met him at a spin class.
How psycho can he be?

18:25.061 --> 18:27.930
What? This is how people
used to meet each other

18:27.964 --> 18:29.064
all the time before the Internet.

18:29.099 --> 18:30.632
Well, I mean, I guess that's true.

18:30.667 --> 18:32.434
Stranger's just a friend
you haven't slept with yet.

18:32.469 --> 18:34.403
Mm, you mean "met yet."

18:35.727 --> 18:36.772
Isn't that what I said?

18:36.806 --> 18:38.307
Okay, but if I do call him,

18:38.341 --> 18:40.542
how do I know it's not a reaction

18:40.577 --> 18:43.045
to finding out that Jacob got married?

18:43.079 --> 18:44.113
- What?!
- Hmm?!

18:44.147 --> 18:45.380
Jacob got married?

18:45.415 --> 18:47.950
Yes. All my exes are married.

18:47.984 --> 18:50.819
Oh, honey.
Who cares if it was a reaction?

18:50.854 --> 18:53.455
I say call him. It's worth a shot.

18:53.490 --> 18:55.958
And now I say can we talk about me?

18:55.992 --> 18:58.160
Because, ladies, phew, I got drama.

18:58.194 --> 18:59.928
[Chuckles] What's up?

18:59.963 --> 19:01.130
Oh, where do I start?

19:01.164 --> 19:03.432
Um, well, Stacey North is still
trying to ruin her career,

19:03.466 --> 19:05.100
which is making me question mine.

19:05.135 --> 19:07.102
- Is she licking bagels again?
- No, I wish.

19:07.137 --> 19:09.616
She's moved on to getting the
crap kicked out of her at Impact.

19:09.636 --> 19:11.837
- Isn't that your place?
- Yeah, well, I sent her there,

19:11.871 --> 19:13.772
but now I-I-I don't know if she's ready,

19:13.806 --> 19:15.874
and I'm really starting to understand

19:15.909 --> 19:18.377
what Harry was feeling when
he saw my bruise, you know?

19:18.411 --> 19:20.946
How's that going? You and Harry?

19:20.980 --> 19:23.849
Oh, well, you know,
the Reza thing was rough.

19:23.883 --> 19:25.584
So, we're just trying
to get through that,

19:25.618 --> 19:27.119
and then there's all this Kate stuff.

19:27.153 --> 19:29.087
It's just like... Which Kate stuff?

19:29.122 --> 19:30.470
The...

19:32.045 --> 19:33.180
Okay.

19:33.927 --> 19:35.093
Okay.

19:35.128 --> 19:36.295
I really... I wasn't gonna bring this up

19:36.329 --> 19:37.968
because it's basically over,
and you guys have to promise

19:37.988 --> 19:40.613
that you are never gonna
tell her that I told you.

19:40.633 --> 19:41.873
Oh, God.

19:43.002 --> 19:45.470
- Kate was sleeping with Scott.
- Scott?

19:45.505 --> 19:48.407
As in Dr. Scott, your ex-fiance?

19:48.441 --> 19:50.709
As in my shoe-loving ex.
Isn't that crazy?

19:50.743 --> 19:53.343
And now she thinks that I was trying
to sabotage the relationship.

19:54.422 --> 19:57.178
- Hello?
- W-Why are you not more surprised?

19:58.040 --> 19:59.284
I sort of knew.

20:00.249 --> 20:01.920
You sort... you sort of...

20:01.955 --> 20:03.789
You sort... what do you mean?
What do you mean?

20:03.823 --> 20:06.792
- You can't sort of know, April.
- Okay, okay. Kate told me.

20:06.826 --> 20:10.262
We had just become friends, and it
felt wrong to betray her confidence.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.431
And for the record, I told her

20:12.465 --> 20:13.966
she shouldn't keep sleeping with him.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.134
And did you sabotage it?
How'd you find out?

20:16.169 --> 20:17.803
No, no.

20:17.837 --> 20:19.838
Scott told me last week right...

20:19.872 --> 20:22.908
before he declared that he's still in
love with me and tried to kiss me.

20:22.942 --> 20:24.776
[Gasps] That I did not know.

20:24.811 --> 20:25.978
- What?!
- I know, I know,

20:26.012 --> 20:28.013
and I told him that he has to
stay away from me and Kate.

20:28.047 --> 20:29.648
But I can't tell her
the truth, you guys.

20:29.682 --> 20:30.849
It'll... It'll break her heart.

20:30.883 --> 20:32.417
And now she's all pissed at me,

20:32.452 --> 20:34.853
and apparently she's moving out,
and it's... see?

20:34.887 --> 20:36.655
I told you. I told you.

20:36.689 --> 20:38.190
It's drama.

20:38.224 --> 20:40.692
You're right... That is a lot.

20:40.727 --> 20:44.696
Though I'm impressed with
how well you're handling it.

20:44.731 --> 20:46.932
April: Seriously.

20:47.743 --> 20:49.661
Yeah. Well,

20:49.925 --> 20:52.104
you know, I'm doing what I can.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.737
Hey, who knows? I mean, maybe...

20:54.757 --> 20:57.175
Maybe moving out will be
a good thing for Kate.

20:57.210 --> 20:58.343
[Crashing]

20:58.378 --> 20:59.611
Ow! [Laughs]

20:59.646 --> 21:02.147
Oh! It's even worse than the last four,

21:02.181 --> 21:04.016
which I didn't think was possible.

21:04.050 --> 21:07.868
[Chuckles] Is there carpet on the wall?

21:07.888 --> 21:09.979
It's got a lot of potential,
doesn't it, Kate?

21:09.999 --> 21:12.958
This place is... Is definitely unique.

21:12.992 --> 21:14.526
If you like it,
I could put in an application.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.994
We've already got three
interested parties.

21:22.902 --> 21:24.903
You should just stay at your brother's.

21:24.937 --> 21:26.405
I told you I can't.

21:26.439 --> 21:27.572
Because you're mooching?

21:27.607 --> 21:28.907
Who cares?

21:28.941 --> 21:31.205
It's not because I'm mooching.

21:32.773 --> 21:34.680
I slept with Joss' ex-fiance.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.016
You what? What about the married guy?

21:38.051 --> 21:39.718
He was the married guy.

21:39.752 --> 21:40.719
Joss found out and broke us up,

21:40.753 --> 21:42.654
and I can't tell Harry
because he'll freak out.

21:42.689 --> 21:44.089
If this doesn't end our relationship,

21:44.123 --> 21:44.923
I don't know what will.

21:44.957 --> 21:45.924
It's all so frustrating!

[Glass shatters]

21:49.896 --> 21:51.730
[Whispering] Yes, definitely.

Kate, Randy?

22:01.051 --> 22:02.221
Hello?

22:06.020 --> 22:07.641
I'm feeling okay.

22:07.661 --> 22:09.129
A little tired at times.

22:09.163 --> 22:11.030
But, you know, I'm not
a young woman anymore.

22:11.065 --> 22:12.799
Fatigue is to be expected.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.834
So, are the liver function
test results back?

22:14.869 --> 22:16.836
Yes, and the enzymes

22:16.871 --> 22:19.005
are still a bit more
elevated than I'd like.

22:19.039 --> 22:21.741
I want to change one of your
medications and increase your diuretic.

22:21.776 --> 22:23.543
So I can be in the bathroom even more?

22:23.577 --> 22:24.544
I know it's a hassle,

22:24.578 --> 22:27.313
but it's the best way to get rid
of excess fluid.

22:27.348 --> 22:30.483
Remember, we can't reverse
the damage to the liver,

22:30.518 --> 22:31.985
only slow it down,

22:32.019 --> 22:33.720
and you need to make sure

22:33.754 --> 22:35.722
that you're not doing any more damage.

22:35.756 --> 22:37.857
Are you avoiding alcohol
like we discussed?

22:37.892 --> 22:39.626
Like it was the devil itself.

22:39.660 --> 22:42.996
April here has been my rock.

22:43.030 --> 22:45.698
Where are we in terms of
the liver transplant?

22:45.733 --> 22:48.535
When would that happen?
Do you have a... a general idea?

22:48.569 --> 22:50.503
Well, that's the good news
and the bad news.

22:50.538 --> 22:52.872
While I wish you were doing
better, Marjorie,

22:52.907 --> 22:54.908
you're not critically ill.

22:54.942 --> 22:57.043
The problem with that is
those are the people

22:57.077 --> 22:59.012
who get the first available livers.

22:59.046 --> 23:01.113
So she's being punished
for not being sicker?

23:01.133 --> 23:02.329
No.

23:02.540 --> 23:04.417
How many months are we talking, Doctor,

23:04.452 --> 23:06.019
until this transplant could happen?

23:06.053 --> 23:07.687
I don't like to give a number.

23:07.721 --> 23:11.090
All I will say is that you're
both going to need to be patient.

23:11.125 --> 23:12.725
I mean, there's no easy way around it.

23:12.760 --> 23:15.328
You have a long, tough road ahead.

23:15.362 --> 23:17.063
So, you need to settle in

23:17.097 --> 23:20.633

of motorcycle riders.

23:39.253 --> 23:40.753
It was good, it was good.

23:40.788 --> 23:42.555
I took Vivian to the park.

- How was yours?
- Good.

23:43.958 --> 23:46.259
Nothing eventful.

23:46.293 --> 23:49.863
Except some guy hit on me
at my spin class.

23:49.897 --> 23:52.699
Oh, really? Was he cute?

23:52.733 --> 23:54.267
Yeah, kind of.

- Yeah.

No, she was great.

Um, I actually just put her down.

your face before she fell asleep.

[Scoffs] I'm not gonna make it.

27:20.977 --> 27:22.673
Shh! Keep your voice down.

27:22.693 --> 27:23.912
What do you want me to do?

27:23.947 --> 27:25.262
Ask her to leave?

27:27.721 --> 27:29.952
I am not asking her to leave.

27:29.986 --> 27:32.421
The doctor just told us
that she's not doing well

27:32.455 --> 27:34.156
and that this is a long process.

27:34.190 --> 27:36.414
It could be a year
before she gets a liver.

27:36.434 --> 27:37.601
A year?!

27:38.108 --> 27:39.302
Look, I'm not suggesting

27:39.337 --> 27:40.737
that we throw her out on the sidewalk,

27:40.771 --> 27:41.995
but if she's willing to spend
all this money,

27:42.015 --> 27:43.380
why can't she rent a place
down the street?

27:43.400 --> 27:45.434
Because she is working on her sobriety.

27:45.469 --> 27:48.904
She has health issues.
She can't be alone right now.

27:48.939 --> 27:52.074
And to be honest, getting some
extra money wouldn't hurt.

27:52.108 --> 27:54.777
What's that supposed to mean?

27:54.811 --> 27:55.911
Nothing. Forget it.

27:55.946 --> 27:58.247
No. Hey, I want to know.

27:58.281 --> 28:00.115
[Sighs]

28:00.150 --> 28:04.053
It means when we first moved in here,

28:04.087 --> 28:05.221
you were doing the odd jobs.

28:05.255 --> 28:06.722
You were going to go to school

28:06.756 --> 28:08.724
to be a drug and alcohol counselor.

28:08.758 --> 28:11.961
Now you're in a band that takes all
of your time and makes no money.

28:12.308 --> 28:13.343
We're back to this again.

28:13.363 --> 28:15.931
I thought you understood
why I needed to do this.

28:15.966 --> 28:18.067
I do, but it doesn't change the fact

28:18.101 --> 28:19.802
that there's only one income.

28:19.836 --> 28:22.438
The store is doing okay,
but not amazing.

28:22.472 --> 28:23.772
It's a lot of pressure,

28:23.807 --> 28:25.319
and my mom is offering to help us.

28:25.339 --> 28:27.276
I didn't realize we needed the help.

28:27.310 --> 28:29.078
Isn't that the whole
reason we downsized?

28:29.112 --> 28:30.856
I was hoping it would help us get ahead,

28:30.876 --> 28:32.249
not drive us backwards.

28:32.269 --> 28:33.525
So I'm dragging you backwards now.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.612
[Scoffs] You're twisting my words.

28:35.647 --> 28:38.515
I am just trying to do what's
smart for the whole family.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.018
If you have a better idea
that doesn't involve

28:41.052 --> 28:44.987
kicking my dying mother out of
the house, I am all ears.

28:47.172 --> 28:48.726
Okay, then. I'm going to sleep.

28:48.760 --> 28:51.762
[â™ªâ™ª]

29:07.886 --> 29:09.120
[Pills rattling]

29:22.965 --> 29:24.802
Oh, hey.

29:24.836 --> 29:26.578
Hey.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.455
Um... wow.

29:29.475 --> 29:30.875
When did you become
such a clothes horse?

29:30.909 --> 29:32.443
We're gonna need another closet.

29:32.478 --> 29:35.012
Oh, it's... it's okay. I've
decided to Goodwill those, so...

29:35.047 --> 29:37.114
Mm.

29:37.149 --> 29:38.382
Hmm?

29:40.079 --> 29:42.353
- Isn't this your favorite?
- Yeah, I know.

29:42.387 --> 29:44.689
Apparently I've, uh, outgrown it.

29:44.723 --> 29:46.357
Oh, yeah.

29:46.391 --> 29:48.960
I-I could've told you that since
the first time I saw you wear it.

29:48.994 --> 29:50.795
Ah. Yeah, well... [Chuckling]

29:50.829 --> 29:53.064
I guess I just wasn't ready
to hear it, huh?

29:53.098 --> 29:54.478
Hmm.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.604
Hey.

30:09.081 --> 30:10.414
[Grunts]

30:10.449 --> 30:12.750
Let's take this into the bedroom, yeah?

30:12.784 --> 30:14.151
Oh, yes. That's an excellent idea.

30:14.186 --> 30:16.654
Yeah. You go. Go.

30:16.688 --> 30:17.822
Go, go, go.

30:20.192 --> 30:21.993
Can I just say I'm glad you called?

30:22.027 --> 30:23.494
I didn't think you were going to.

30:23.529 --> 30:25.196
To be honest, I wasn't sure either.

30:25.230 --> 30:26.430
Why did you?

30:26.465 --> 30:28.399
I liked your boldness.

30:28.433 --> 30:31.235
Well, I've never been one
to follow the rules.

30:31.270 --> 30:34.272
Just like you with your throuple.

30:34.306 --> 30:36.240
You read my book.

30:36.275 --> 30:37.842
I hope that's not a bad thing.

30:37.876 --> 30:39.176
No, not at all.

30:39.211 --> 30:41.178
It just means you know a lot
more about me

30:41.213 --> 30:43.080
than I know about you.

30:43.115 --> 30:45.616
Well, it doesn't have to be that way.

30:46.285 --> 30:48.219
- What do you mean?
- Why don't we, uh, wipe the slate clean?

30:48.253 --> 30:49.754
I'll pretend I know nothing about you,

30:49.788 --> 30:51.355
you pretend you know nothing about me?

30:51.390 --> 30:53.457
That shouldn't be hard.
I know nothing about you.

30:53.492 --> 30:54.792
Right.

30:54.826 --> 30:57.094
Uh, my name is Adam. I'm a dentist.

30:57.129 --> 30:58.195
What do you do?

30:58.230 --> 31:00.064
[Chuckles]

31:04.269 --> 31:06.871
[Sighs]

31:06.905 --> 31:08.940
Sweetie... what's wrong?

31:09.795 --> 31:11.438
He blocked me.

31:11.458 --> 31:13.244
I tried calling Scott to hear
his side of the story,

31:13.278 --> 31:15.546
but it rang once and went to voicemail.

31:15.581 --> 31:16.814
That doesn't mean he blocked you.

31:16.848 --> 31:17.848
- His phone could be off.
- No, no, no.

31:17.883 --> 31:20.151
I read online about how
to disguise my number,

31:20.185 --> 31:23.321
so I called back. He picked up.

31:23.355 --> 31:25.790
I felt so humiliated, I just...
I hung up.

31:25.824 --> 31:28.259
Look, I think you're
better off, personally.

31:28.293 --> 31:30.895
You're probably right, I know, but...

31:30.929 --> 31:33.464
the truth is if he ever
finds out about this,

31:33.498 --> 31:35.466
he's just gonna keep on
feeling sorry for me.

31:35.500 --> 31:37.301
- Scott?
- No.

31:37.336 --> 31:39.570
- Harry.
- Okay, well, wait.

31:39.605 --> 31:41.806
- How did we get to Harry?
- [Scoffs]

31:41.840 --> 31:44.475
Because when I was a kid,
I worshiped him.

31:44.509 --> 31:46.344
He took care of me.

31:46.378 --> 31:48.179
All I ever wanted was to impress him

31:48.213 --> 31:50.348
because he was my cool older brother.

31:50.382 --> 31:52.183
Apparently nothing's changed.

31:54.150 --> 31:55.186
You should've seen how he looked at me

31:55.220 --> 31:56.354
when he heard I broke that lamp.

31:56.388 --> 31:58.135
Okay, you know that Harry loves you.

31:58.155 --> 32:01.158
Yes, but in a way that you love
a three-legged dog.

32:01.193 --> 32:04.829
Like... Like I'm some sad sack

32:04.863 --> 32:07.264
who has to live in his guest
house for the rest of my life.

32:07.299 --> 32:10.267
Okay, I doubt that. He's your brother.

32:10.302 --> 32:11.969
Harry will always have your back,

32:12.004 --> 32:13.437
and sometimes a three-legged dog

32:13.472 --> 32:16.207
needs to get out and meet
other three-legged dogs,

32:16.241 --> 32:20.111
and maybe then she'll realize
that she actually has four legs.

32:22.669 --> 32:24.915
- What?
- [Chuckles] Come here.

32:26.885 --> 32:28.219
â™ª I'm here now â™ª

32:28.253 --> 32:29.520
[Sighs]

32:30.889 --> 32:32.323
â™ª I'm here now â™ª

32:32.357 --> 32:34.158
I'm making flank steak for dinner.

32:34.192 --> 32:35.359
Are you not eating here?

32:35.394 --> 32:37.892
Ooh, no. Uh, band's meeting early.

32:39.019 --> 32:41.526
Well, this'll be good for later.

32:45.073 --> 32:46.771
April, we need to talk.

32:48.196 --> 32:49.577
Okay.

32:51.266 --> 32:53.756
I've been doing a lot
of thinking, and, um,

32:53.976 --> 32:57.208
I still think that all of us
under the same roof is...

32:57.228 --> 33:00.017
- it's a bad situation.
- I told you.

33:00.052 --> 33:02.253
If you had a better idea, I am all ears.

33:02.287 --> 33:04.241
I think I should move out.

33:05.569 --> 33:06.590
What?

33:06.625 --> 33:09.326
Yeah, just... Just temporarily.

33:10.597 --> 33:13.364
Let's be realistic.
Your mom doesn't want me here.

33:13.398 --> 33:15.733
Now she's causing you and me to fight.

33:15.767 --> 33:17.401
I'm just worried that if I stay,

33:17.436 --> 33:18.720
things are gonna keep getting worse.

33:18.740 --> 33:20.037
I can't believe this.

33:20.072 --> 33:22.694
You're punishing me
for taking care of my mom.

33:22.714 --> 33:24.729
That's not what this is.
I'm doing this to take care of us.

33:24.749 --> 33:27.214
- By running away?
- I'm not running away.

33:27.234 --> 33:29.580
Well, that's what it feels like.

33:29.614 --> 33:33.417
When things get hard,
you don't just up and move out.

33:33.452 --> 33:35.047
You work through them.

33:35.067 --> 33:37.134
And if it was just you and me, I would.

33:37.169 --> 33:39.036
But this isn't a good
environment for me.

33:39.071 --> 33:40.571
I need some space.

33:41.717 --> 33:43.074
It's probably best for your mom, too.

33:43.108 --> 33:45.510
Don't use her as an excuse.

33:45.544 --> 33:48.853
If this relationship
is so hard to be in,

33:48.873 --> 33:50.870
maybe we shouldn't continue it.

33:51.213 --> 33:52.550
Okay, you're over-reacting.

33:52.584 --> 33:54.379
I'm over-reacting? Really?

33:54.399 --> 33:55.775
You're the one sprinting for the door,

33:55.795 --> 33:58.502
and this temporary arrangement
you've cooked up in your head,

33:58.537 --> 34:00.971
that is not gonna work for me.

34:01.006 --> 34:03.808
I'm a single mom.
I don't have room in my life

34:03.842 --> 34:07.311
for a relationship that's taking
a giant step backwards.

34:11.058 --> 34:13.717
I need to know if you're in or out.

34:14.494 --> 34:15.795
Don't do this, April.

34:15.815 --> 34:18.989
In or out. Which is it?

34:20.024 --> 34:22.025
Not giving me much of a choice.

34:24.822 --> 34:26.463
Guess I'm out.

34:26.498 --> 34:29.500
[â™ªâ™ª]

34:39.989 --> 34:42.379
- [Door closes]
- [Sighs]

34:45.684 --> 34:47.051
[Sniffles]

34:48.453 --> 34:49.687
[Clatter]

34:55.491 --> 34:56.525
Harry: Oh.

34:57.074 --> 34:59.261
Uh, Kate, wait up. Please, wait.

34:59.295 --> 35:02.964
[Chuckles] Um, okay.

35:02.999 --> 35:06.468
Uh, I was out of line yesterday,
and I'm really sorry.

35:06.502 --> 35:08.403
If you want to move out,
I'm behind you 100%.

35:08.438 --> 35:11.088
I'll even float you a
loan if you need it.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.441
Thank you.

35:14.101 --> 35:15.444
But I won't need it.

35:17.483 --> 35:18.780
Okay, uh, why not?

35:18.815 --> 35:20.649
I was going to wait to tell you this,

35:20.683 --> 35:24.842
but, uh, I'm thinking of going
away for a little while.

35:25.801 --> 35:28.423
Maybe even moving back to Australia.

35:29.168 --> 35:31.426
What? Why?

35:31.461 --> 35:32.828
I need to be somewhere

35:32.862 --> 35:35.597
that I can figure out
what I really want.

35:35.631 --> 35:37.332
Why can't you do that here?

35:37.366 --> 35:40.435
You've got great friends,
you've got me and Joss.

35:40.470 --> 35:43.305
I mean, I know that we've been
caught up in our own...

35:43.339 --> 35:45.240
Our own stuff lately. You know what?

35:45.274 --> 35:48.009
We should all sit down
over a meal, reconnect.

35:48.678 --> 35:51.179
The three... The three of us. What?

35:51.771 --> 35:53.348
Nothing. Just nothing.

35:53.382 --> 35:55.083
Can we just sit down
for a second, please?

35:55.118 --> 35:56.384
Come on.

36:00.259 --> 36:03.458
I can't help you if you won't
tell me what's going on.

36:05.495 --> 36:08.263
I don't want you to be mad at me.

36:08.297 --> 36:10.165
Why would I be mad?

36:10.902 --> 36:14.302
Come on. Whatever it is,
I'm sure we can talk it through.

36:15.048 --> 36:17.772
The guy I was seeing was
Scott Trosman, Joss' ex.

36:17.807 --> 36:19.373
Started out as this crazy coincidence,

36:19.393 --> 36:22.377
but then after I-I learned
of who he was...

36:22.411 --> 36:24.504
[Crying] I still couldn't break it off.

36:24.524 --> 36:26.848
What? Did you think
I'd be okay with that?

36:26.883 --> 36:28.783
I didn't think. I just really liked him.

36:28.818 --> 36:29.851
So, what, you hid it from me?

36:29.886 --> 36:31.052
I was trying to find
the right time to tell you,

36:31.087 --> 36:33.551
but then after Scott told Joss,
I figured she'd tell you.

36:33.571 --> 36:35.957
Sorry, what did you...
Joss knew about this?

36:36.431 --> 36:37.893
- Yes.
- Okay.

36:37.927 --> 36:39.194
Harry, please.

36:39.228 --> 36:40.395
I thought we were gonna
work through this.

36:40.429 --> 36:42.182
Trust me, you do not want to hear
what I have to say right now.

36:42.202 --> 36:43.498
Harry, please!

36:45.001 --> 36:46.201
[Sighing]

36:51.340 --> 36:53.608
[Crying]

36:56.512 --> 36:58.380
There you are.

36:58.414 --> 36:59.714
[Clears throat]

36:59.749 --> 37:03.351
- Lucy's been looking for you.
- Oh, I'll be right in.

37:05.454 --> 37:08.190
I told her you need
some time to yourself.

37:10.626 --> 37:12.394
I heard you and Marc...

37:12.428 --> 37:14.496
I don't want to talk about it.

37:17.967 --> 37:20.202
[Sighs]

37:20.236 --> 37:22.504
This too shall pass.

37:31.948 --> 37:33.582
[Crying]

37:37.987 --> 37:39.921
Good job. Okay.

37:39.956 --> 37:41.423
- [Gasps] Your mommy's here.
- Hi, Lydia.

37:41.457 --> 37:43.091
- I'm home.
- Hi!

37:43.125 --> 37:45.293
We're just doing a little floor time.

37:45.328 --> 37:46.881
[Gasps] Hi!

37:46.901 --> 37:49.431
How was your day? Did you
get a lot of writing done?

37:49.465 --> 37:50.599
Mama's here.

37:50.633 --> 37:53.301
Actually, I went on a date.

37:53.336 --> 37:55.403
- Sweetie.
- Good for you!

37:55.438 --> 37:56.638
- [Knock on door]
- There you go!

37:56.672 --> 37:57.906
Oh. I'll get it.

37:57.940 --> 37:59.541
[Gasps] You playing?

37:59.575 --> 38:01.643
How was your day?

38:01.677 --> 38:03.049
Oh. Hi.

38:03.069 --> 38:05.880
I'm looking for... Karen, hey.

38:05.915 --> 38:07.582
Forgot your dessert.

38:07.617 --> 38:08.817
Please, come in.

38:08.851 --> 38:10.552
Adam, this is Lydia.

38:10.586 --> 38:12.387
You must be Vivian's nanny.

38:12.421 --> 38:15.290
- Hello.
- [Chuckling] This must be Vivian.

38:15.324 --> 38:17.792
- [Chuckles]
- She's beautiful.

38:17.827 --> 38:19.227
[Coos]

38:19.262 --> 38:20.595
Thank you.

38:20.630 --> 38:22.130
Well, now that I've met your daughter,

38:22.164 --> 38:23.465
I guess we have to go on a second date.

38:23.499 --> 38:25.400
I guess so.

38:25.434 --> 38:27.711
[Vivian babbling]

38:27.731 --> 38:30.438
- Cutie pie.
- [Laughs]

38:30.473 --> 38:32.474
Hey, honey.

38:32.508 --> 38:35.010
Just thinking about going out for
a run. You want to come with?

38:35.044 --> 38:37.012
- You lied to me.
- [Keys jingle]

38:37.046 --> 38:38.013
Again.

38:38.047 --> 38:40.248
- [Cellphone ringing]
- Do not get that.

38:40.283 --> 38:42.651
I wasn't going to.

38:42.685 --> 38:45.320
You told me you didn't know
why Kate was moving out.

38:45.354 --> 38:46.755
I know about Scott.

38:46.789 --> 38:49.232
[Chuckles]

38:49.252 --> 38:50.517
I can't believe she told you.

38:50.537 --> 38:52.294
I can't believe you didn't. Joss.

38:52.328 --> 38:54.191
Okay, look, it was an
unfortunate situation, Harry,

38:54.211 --> 38:55.396
but I handled it, okay?

38:55.416 --> 38:57.287
Hey, this isn't one of
your P.R. messes, Joss.

38:57.307 --> 39:00.435
I'm not some 21-year-old
singer you can handle.

39:00.455 --> 39:02.212
This is my sister and this is us.

39:02.232 --> 39:03.725
Okay, but when I found out about it,

39:03.745 --> 39:05.229
you and I weren't exactly
in a great place,

39:05.249 --> 39:07.642
and so I made the decision
not to upset you, but now...

39:07.677 --> 39:10.161
Okay, stop pretending you're
doing me a favor, please.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.574
I'm not pretending anything.

39:11.594 --> 39:13.515
You know, you were the one
that said you never ever

39:13.549 --> 39:15.413
wanted to hear about Scott
ever after last year.

39:15.433 --> 39:17.410
Asking for his ring back
and dating my sister

39:17.430 --> 39:18.862
are slightly different things,
don't you think?

39:18.882 --> 39:20.741
Okay, well, I'm sorry that I, you know,

39:20.761 --> 39:24.592
once again failed to decipher
the code that is Harry, you know?

39:26.562 --> 39:27.992
Wow.

39:28.159 --> 39:30.899
You can't even admit that you're wrong.

39:31.208 --> 39:33.343
I guess you're so used to
keeping things from me

39:33.363 --> 39:35.804
that it doesn't seem wrong anymore.

39:38.674 --> 39:40.208
[Cellphone chimes]

39:40.242 --> 39:43.211
[â™ªâ™ª]

39:47.683 --> 39:48.650
What are you doing?

39:48.684 --> 39:50.585
- I got to go.
- Are you serious?

39:50.619 --> 39:53.292
Joss, what are you...
Okay, fine, yeah, good.

39:53.312 --> 39:54.989
Just go.

39:55.024 --> 39:57.559
[Door opens, closes]

39:57.593 --> 40:00.628
[â™ªâ™ª]

40:05.935 --> 40:08.536
â™ª In the quiet of a shadow â™ª

40:10.740 --> 40:13.575
â™ª In the corner of a room â™ª

40:15.978 --> 40:19.214
â™ª Darkness moves upon you â™ª

40:20.189 --> 40:23.651
â™ª Like a cloud across the moon â™ª

40:24.887 --> 40:28.823
â™ª You're aware in all the silence â™ª

40:29.755 --> 40:32.861
â™ª Of a constant that will turn â™ª

40:34.558 --> 40:37.799
â™ª Like the windmill left deserted â™ª

40:37.833 --> 40:39.344
[Vehicle passes]

40:39.364 --> 40:42.070
â™ª Or the sun forever burn â™ª

40:43.963 --> 40:49.827
â™ª So don't forget to breathe â™ª

40:49.994 --> 40:53.381
â™ª Don't forget to breathe â™ª

40:54.833 --> 40:58.219
â™ª Don't forget to breathe â™ª

40:59.388 --> 41:01.306
â™ª You know you are here â™ª

41:01.326 --> 41:03.796
â™ª But you find you want to leave â™ª

41:03.816 --> 41:09.662
â™ª So don't forget to â™ª

41:10.273 --> 41:12.133
â™ª Breathe â™ª

41:14.822 --> 41:18.139
â™ª Just breathe â™ª

41:24.368 --> 41:27.282
â™ª Just breathe â™ª

41:30.236 --> 41:32.865
Hey. You okay?

41:33.404 --> 41:36.273
I just can't believe Marisol's gone.

41:36.740 --> 41:38.069
Yeah.

41:39.067 --> 41:40.499
None of us can.

41:40.519 --> 41:42.495
Look, I'm so sorry
about what I said before.

41:42.515 --> 41:45.484
You were right. I mean,
I do. I need this place.

41:45.504 --> 41:47.384
It's... it's okay, Joss.

41:47.418 --> 41:48.575
Yeah.

41:48.595 --> 41:50.907
â™ª Just breathe â™ª
