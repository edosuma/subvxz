We... We just got you back on track
after your whole bagel incident,

10:20.133 --> 10:21.567
and now you're pulling this crap?

10:21.601 --> 10:23.572
They wanted me to say something like,

10:23.592 --> 10:25.402
"This makeup can change your life.

10:25.422 --> 10:27.796
"It changed mine." I can't do that.

10:27.830 --> 10:29.798
Okay, well, then, honey,
we ask for a rewrite.

10:29.832 --> 10:31.699
Jackie says the beauty
industry makes women

10:31.734 --> 10:33.535
feel bad about themselves
so that they can keep

10:33.569 --> 10:35.069
selling them things
that they don't need.

10:35.104 --> 10:36.805
Okay, that's great,
but I'm not sure that Jackie

10:36.839 --> 10:38.273
should be giving you career advice.

10:38.307 --> 10:40.041
And I didn't even know
you were going to Impact.

10:40.075 --> 10:42.361
Yeah, we go at different times.

10:42.381 --> 10:43.945
Though I'm thinking about
starting two-a-days.

10:43.979 --> 10:46.080
Whoa, hey, stop...

10:46.115 --> 10:47.615
Is that from class?

10:47.650 --> 10:49.083
I think it looks kind of badass.

10:49.118 --> 10:50.985
Jackie said that you
had one just like it.

10:51.020 --> 10:52.654
Yeah, well, I was, like, five
months in, and you just started.

10:52.688 --> 10:54.455
No, Stacey, that...
That looks really bad.

10:54.490 --> 10:55.790
Listen, I think
you should pause on class,

10:55.825 --> 10:58.382
- at least until that heals.
- Are you kidding?

10:58.402 --> 11:00.395
This is the most empowered
I've ever felt.

11:00.429 --> 11:01.596
Great, and I'm totally
on board with that,

11:01.630 --> 11:03.731
but let's not forget the bigger
picture here... your career.

11:03.766 --> 11:05.266
Okay, I have P.R. set up
for you, little lady,

11:05.301 --> 11:06.634
for the next three weeks
that you can't do

11:06.669 --> 11:07.936
if you look like an MMA fighter.

11:07.970 --> 11:10.939
- Who lost.
- That's why God invented Photoshop.

11:10.973 --> 11:12.774
Stop acting like my grandma.

11:12.808 --> 11:15.936
Besides, you're the one who
suggested the class to begin with.

11:15.956 --> 11:17.257
Yeah...

11:17.291 --> 11:20.093
Do you have anything
to drink around here?

11:24.932 --> 11:27.565
I'm about to head out.
Do you need anything before I go?

11:27.585 --> 11:30.053
No. Have a nice night.

11:30.088 --> 11:32.089
Are you sure you don't want to talk?

11:32.123 --> 11:33.657
I'm... I'm not in any rush.

11:33.691 --> 11:35.025
I'll pour some wine.

11:36.828 --> 11:38.829
All right, twist my arm.

11:38.863 --> 11:41.156
Okay, so, what's going on?

11:41.176 --> 11:42.966
Is this about your ex getting married?

11:43.001 --> 11:46.553
[Sighs] It's stupid that it
bugs me, I know.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.939
I mean, it's not stupid.

11:48.973 --> 11:49.973
I just wish I didn't care.

11:50.008 --> 11:51.942
I have a beautiful daughter

11:51.976 --> 11:53.310
and an amazing life, really.

11:53.344 --> 11:55.599
Do you still love him? - No.

11:55.619 --> 11:57.647
Just in a nostalgic way.

11:57.682 --> 12:00.584
I guess I'm feeling a little lonely.

12:00.618 --> 12:02.626
This is why social media is evil.

12:02.646 --> 12:05.355
[Chuckles] Well, any guy
would be lucky to have you.

12:06.417 --> 12:08.423
That's sweet of you to say.

12:08.443 --> 12:09.659
If you can't land a good guy,

12:09.694 --> 12:11.361
there's no hope for the rest of us.

12:11.396 --> 12:13.126
[Chuckles] Don't be silly.

12:13.372 --> 12:17.667
What is happening with you? Did you
take my advice about online dating?

12:17.702 --> 12:19.669
Um, I've chatted with a few guys.

12:19.704 --> 12:21.872
Ooh. Anyone promising?

12:22.648 --> 12:24.432
- There's one.
- How exciting.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.043
Have you gone out with him yet?

12:26.077 --> 12:28.879
No. No, no, no. I'm... I'm too shy.

12:28.913 --> 12:30.514
The thought of meeting him in person

12:30.548 --> 12:31.848
makes me really uncomfortable.

12:31.883 --> 12:33.850
I mean, I know it sounds strange,

12:33.885 --> 12:35.852
but getting to know him online just...

12:35.887 --> 12:37.320
feels safer.

12:37.355 --> 12:40.057
That doesn't sound strange at all.

12:40.091 --> 12:40.991
[Baby crying]

12:41.025 --> 12:42.159
Oh, I'll take this.

12:42.193 --> 12:43.894

12:43.928 --> 12:46.696
Oh, I think I'm gonna write
from here tomorrow morning,

12:46.731 --> 12:48.899
so you can start a little later.

12:48.933 --> 12:50.500
Around noon?

12:50.535 --> 12:52.235
Oh, okay.

12:52.270 --> 12:53.904
Oh, wait.

12:53.938 --> 12:55.539
I forgot, I have spin class
in the morning.

12:55.573 --> 12:57.140
So I'll just see you at the usual time.

12:57.175 --> 12:58.208
Good night.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.815

want to be murdered.

13:04.849 --> 13:08.552
Okay. How about...

13:08.586 --> 13:09.753
Eagle Rock?

13:09.787 --> 13:12.597
Sure, if you want to live
with ex-hippies and breeders.

13:12.617 --> 13:15.225
I love dogs. I meant straight people.

13:15.259 --> 13:17.527
Have you really thought this through?

13:17.562 --> 13:19.529
Going from Harry and Joss to this?

13:19.564 --> 13:22.332
It's like trading in the
penthouse for the outhouse.

13:22.366 --> 13:23.900
You have it made.

13:23.935 --> 13:26.436
There's also something to be
said for being independent.

13:26.471 --> 13:28.438
But things are weird at home.

13:28.473 --> 13:29.940
What? Weird how?

13:29.974 --> 13:32.576
Something feels off.

13:32.610 --> 13:34.544
Harry and I have always been so close,

13:34.579 --> 13:36.580
and now there's this little...

13:36.614 --> 13:38.615
distance.

13:38.649 --> 13:42.085
I think a bit of space will help us.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.354
Will you come with me to look
at places tomorrow?

13:44.388 --> 13:46.223
- What about work?
- We can go after.

13:46.257 --> 13:47.958
Since when do you care
so much about work?

13:47.992 --> 13:49.926
I don't. I just didn't want to
tell you it sounded boring.

13:49.961 --> 13:52.095
Maybe there will be some cute
gay real-estate agents there.

13:52.130 --> 13:55.298
[Sighs] Why do I let you do this to me?

13:55.333 --> 13:57.033
But we're gonna have to get
a few drinks beforehand.

13:57.068 --> 13:58.535
Ha! Perfect! Drinks on me.

- What?

No, to help pay down the
principal on our mortgage.

- Wow, that's nice of her.
- Is it?

15:18.687 --> 15:20.855

She's trying to outdo me, obviously.

15:22.524 --> 15:24.425

out of the house,

Mm, you mean "met yet."

18:35.727 --> 18:36.772
Isn't that what I said?

18:36.806 --> 18:38.307
Okay, but if I do call him,

18:38.341 --> 18:40.542
how do I know it's not a reaction

18:40.577 --> 18:43.045
to finding out that Jacob got married?

18:43.079 --> 18:44.113
- What?!
- Hmm?!

18:44.147 --> 18:45.380
Jacob got married?

18:45.415 --> 18:47.950
Yes. All my exes are married.

18:47.984 --> 18:50.819
Oh, honey.
Who cares if it was a reaction?

18:50.854 --> 18:53.455
I say call him. It's worth a shot.

18:53.490 --> 18:55.958
And now I say can we talk about me?

18:55.992 --> 18:58.160
Because, ladies, phew, I got drama.

18:58.194 --> 18:59.928
[Chuckles] What's up?

18:59.963 --> 19:01.130
Oh, where do I start?

19:01.164 --> 19:03.432
Um, well, Stacey North is still
trying to ruin her career,

19:03.466 --> 19:05.100
which is making me question mine.

19:05.135 --> 19:07.102
- Is she licking bagels again?
- No, I wish.

19:07.137 --> 19:09.616
She's moved on to getting the
crap kicked out of her at Impact.

19:09.636 --> 19:11.837
- Isn't that your place?
- Yeah, well, I sent her there,

19:11.871 --> 19:13.772
but now I-I-I don't know if she's ready,

19:13.806 --> 19:15.874
and I'm really starting to understand

19:15.909 --> 19:18.377
what Harry was feeling when
he saw my bruise, you know?

19:18.411 --> 19:20.946
How's that going? You and Harry?

19:20.980 --> 19:23.849
Oh, well, you know,
the Reza thing was rough.

19:23.883 --> 19:25.584
So, we're just trying
to get through that,

19:25.618 --> 19:27.119
and then there's all this Kate stuff.

19:27.153 --> 19:29.087
It's just like... Which Kate stuff?

19:29.122 --> 19:30.470
The...

19:32.045 --> 19:33.180
Okay.

19:33.927 --> 19:35.093
Okay.

19:35.128 --> 19:36.295
I really... I wasn't gonna bring this up

19:36.329 --> 19:37.968
because it's basically over,
and you guys have to promise

19:37.988 --> 19:40.613
that you are never gonna
tell her that I told you.

19:40.633 --> 19:41.873
Oh, God.

19:43.002 --> 19:45.470
- Kate was sleeping with Scott.
- Scott?

19:45.505 --> 19:48.407
As in Dr. Scott, your ex-fiance?

19:48.441 --> 19:50.709
As in my shoe-loving ex.
Isn't that crazy?

19:50.743 --> 19:53.343
And now she thinks that I was trying
to sabotage the relationship.

19:54.422 --> 19:57.178
- Hello?
- W-Why are you not more surprised?

19:58.040 --> 19:59.284
I sort of knew.

20:00.249 --> 20:01.920
You sort... you sort of...

20:01.955 --> 20:03.789
You sort... what do you mean?
What do you mean?

20:03.823 --> 20:06.792
- You can't sort of know, April.
- Okay, okay. Kate told me.

20:06.826 --> 20:10.262
We had just become friends, and it
felt wrong to betray her confidence.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.431
And for the record, I told her

20:12.465 --> 20:13.966
she shouldn't keep sleeping with him.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.134
And did you sabotage it?
How'd you find out?

20:16.169 --> 20:17.803
No, no.

20:17.837 --> 20:19.838
Scott told me last week right...

20:19.872 --> 20:22.908
before he declared that he's still in
love with me and tried to kiss me.

20:22.942 --> 20:24.776
[Gasps] That I did not know.

20:24.811 --> 20:25.978
- What?!
- I know, I know,

20:26.012 --> 20:28.013
and I told him that he has to
stay away from me and Kate.

20:28.047 --> 20:29.648
But I can't tell her
the truth, you guys.

20:29.682 --> 20:30.849
It'll... It'll break her heart.

20:30.883 --> 20:32.417
And now she's all pissed at me,

20:32.452 --> 20:34.853
and apparently she's moving out,
and it's... see?

20:34.887 --> 20:36.655
I told you. I told you.

20:36.689 --> 20:38.190
It's drama.

20:38.224 --> 20:40.692
You're right... That is a lot.

20:40.727 --> 20:44.696
Though I'm impressed with
how well you're handling it.

20:44.731 --> 20:46.932
April: Seriously.

20:47.743 --> 20:49.661
Yeah. Well,

20:49.925 --> 20:52.104
you know, I'm doing what I can.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.737
Hey, who knows? I mean, maybe...

20:54.757 --> 20:57.175
Maybe moving out will be
a good thing for Kate.

20:57.210 --> 20:58.343
[Crashing]

20:58.378 --> 20:59.611
Ow! [Laughs]

20:59.646 --> 21:02.147
Oh! It's even worse than the last four,

21:02.181 --> 21:04.016
which I didn't think was possible.

21:04.050 --> 21:07.868
[Chuckles] Is there carpet on the wall?

21:07.888 --> 21:09.979
It's got a lot of potential,
doesn't it, Kate?

21:09.999 --> 21:12.958
This place is... Is definitely unique.

21:12.992 --> 21:14.526
If you like it,
I could put in an application.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.994
We've already got three
interested parties.

21:21.534 --> 21:22.868
I tried to warn you.

21:22.902 --> 21:24.903
You should just stay at your brother's.

21:24.937 --> 21:26.405
I told you I can't.

21:26.439 --> 21:27.572
Because you're mooching?

21:27.607 --> 21:28.907
Who cares?

21:28.941 --> 21:31.205
It's not because I'm mooching.

21:32.773 --> 21:34.680
I slept with Joss' ex-fiance.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.016
You what? What about the married guy?

21:38.051 --> 21:39.718
He was the married guy.

21:39.752 --> 21:40.719
Joss found out and broke us up,

21:40.753 --> 21:42.654
and I can't tell Harry
because he'll freak out.

21:42.689 --> 21:44.089
If this doesn't end our relationship,

21:44.123 --> 21:44.923
I don't know what will.

21:44.957 --> 21:45.924
It's all so frustrating!

[Glass shatters]

21:48.594 --> 21:49.861
Shall we?

21:49.896 --> 21:51.730
[Whispering] Yes, definitely.

Kate, Randy?

22:01.051 --> 22:02.221
Hello?

22:06.020 --> 22:07.641
I'm feeling okay.

22:07.661 --> 22:09.129
A little tired at times.

22:09.163 --> 22:11.030
But, you know, I'm not
a young woman anymore.

22:11.065 --> 22:12.799
Fatigue is to be expected.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.834
So, are the liver function
test results back?

22:14.869 --> 22:16.836
Yes, and the enzymes

22:16.871 --> 22:19.005
are still a bit more
elevated than I'd like.

22:19.039 --> 22:21.741
I want to change one of your
medications and increase your diuretic.

22:21.776 --> 22:23.543
So I can be in the bathroom even more?

22:23.577 --> 22:24.544
I know it's a hassle,

22:24.578 --> 22:27.313
but it's the best way to get rid
of excess fluid.

22:27.348 --> 22:30.483
Remember, we can't reverse
the damage to the liver,

22:30.518 --> 22:31.985
only slow it down,

22:32.019 --> 22:33.720
and you need to make sure

22:33.754 --> 22:35.722
that you're not doing any more damage.

22:35.756 --> 22:37.857
Are you avoiding alcohol
like we discussed?

22:37.892 --> 22:39.626
Like it was the devil itself.

22:39.660 --> 22:42.996
April here has been my rock.

22:43.030 --> 22:45.698
Where are we in terms of
the liver transplant?

22:45.733 --> 22:48.535
When would that happen?
Do you have a... a general idea?

22:48.569 --> 22:50.503
Well, that's the good news
and the bad news.

22:50.538 --> 22:52.872
While I wish you were doing
better, Marjorie,

22:52.907 --> 22:54.908
you're not critically ill.

22:54.942 --> 22:57.043
The problem with that is
those are the people

22:57.077 --> 22:59.012
who get the first available livers.

22:59.046 --> 23:01.113
So she's being punished
for not being sicker?

23:01.133 --> 23:02.329
No.

23:02.540 --> 23:04.417
How many months are we talking, Doctor,

23:04.452 --> 23:06.019
until this transplant could happen?

23:06.053 --> 23:07.687
I don't like to give a number.

23:07.721 --> 23:11.090
All I will say is that you're
both going to need to be patient.

23:11.125 --> 23:12.725
I mean, there's no easy way around it.

23:12.760 --> 23:15.328
You have a long, tough road ahead.

23:15.362 --> 23:17.063
So, you need to settle in

23:17.097 --> 23:20.633
and pray for rainy days and lots
of motorcycle riders.

You're home early.

23:36.966 --> 23:39.219
I had a cancellation. How was your day?

23:39.253 --> 23:40.753
It was good, it was good.

23:40.788 --> 23:42.555
I took Vivian to the park.

23:42.590 --> 23:43.923
- How was yours?
- Good.

23:43.958 --> 23:46.259
Nothing eventful.

23:46.293 --> 23:49.863
Except some guy hit on me
at my spin class.

23:49.897 --> 23:52.699
Oh, really? Was he cute?

23:52.733 --> 23:54.267
Yeah, kind of.

23:54.301 --> 23:56.035
He had these big sparkling eyes

23:56.070 --> 23:58.705
like one of those Disney movie princes.

- Did you get his name?
- Yeah.

24:03.811 --> 24:05.812
Oh! Sorry.

No, I'm fine.

No, she was great.

24:18.926 --> 24:20.326
Um, I actually just put her down.

your face before she fell asleep.

at Figueroa Realty.

just not tell anyone?

sticking to my plan.

pay that much.

your savings, are you?

Shh! Keep your voice down.

27:22.693 --> 27:23.912
What do you want me to do?

27:23.947 --> 27:25.262
Ask her to leave?

27:27.721 --> 27:29.952
I am not asking her to leave.

27:29.986 --> 27:32.421
The doctor just told us
that she's not doing well

27:32.455 --> 27:34.156
and that this is a long process.

27:34.190 --> 27:36.414
It could be a year
before she gets a liver.

27:36.434 --> 27:37.601
A year?!

27:38.108 --> 27:39.302
Look, I'm not suggesting

27:39.337 --> 27:40.737
that we throw her out on the sidewalk,

27:40.771 --> 27:41.995
but if she's willing to spend
all this money,

27:42.015 --> 27:43.380
why can't she rent a place
down the street?

27:43.400 --> 27:45.434
Because she is working on her sobriety.

27:45.469 --> 27:48.904
She has health issues.
She can't be alone right now.

27:48.939 --> 27:52.074
And to be honest, getting some
extra money wouldn't hurt.

27:52.108 --> 27:54.777
What's that supposed to mean?

27:54.811 --> 27:55.911
Nothing. Forget it.

27:55.946 --> 27:58.247
No. Hey, I want to know.

27:58.281 --> 28:00.115
[Sighs]

28:00.150 --> 28:04.053
It means when we first moved in here,

28:04.087 --> 28:05.221
you were doing the odd jobs.

28:05.255 --> 28:06.722
You were going to go to school

28:06.756 --> 28:08.724
to be a drug and alcohol counselor.

28:08.758 --> 28:11.961
Now you're in a band that takes all
of your time and makes no money.

28:12.308 --> 28:13.343
We're back to this again.

28:13.363 --> 28:15.931
I thought you understood
why I needed to do this.

28:15.966 --> 28:18.067
I do, but it doesn't change the fact

28:18.101 --> 28:19.802
that there's only one income.

28:19.836 --> 28:22.438
The store is doing okay,
but not amazing.

28:22.472 --> 28:23.772
It's a lot of pressure,

28:23.807 --> 28:25.319
and my mom is offering to help us.

28:25.339 --> 28:27.276
I didn't realize we needed the help.

28:27.310 --> 28:29.078
Isn't that the whole
reason we downsized?

28:29.112 --> 28:30.856
I was hoping it would help us get ahead,

28:30.876 --> 28:32.249
not drive us backwards.

28:32.269 --> 28:33.525
So I'm dragging you backwards now.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.612
[Scoffs] You're twisting my words.

28:35.647 --> 28:38.515
I am just trying to do what's
smart for the whole family.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.018
If you have a better idea
that doesn't involve

28:41.052 --> 28:44.987
kicking my dying mother out of
the house, I am all ears.

28:47.172 --> 28:48.726
Okay, then. I'm going to sleep.

28:48.760 --> 28:51.762

Oh, hey.

29:24.836 --> 29:26.578
Hey.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.455
Um... wow.

29:29.475 --> 29:30.875
When did you become
such a clothes horse?

29:30.909 --> 29:32.443
We're gonna need another closet.

29:32.478 --> 29:35.012
Oh, it's... it's okay. I've
decided to Goodwill those, so...

29:35.047 --> 29:37.114
Mm.

29:37.149 --> 29:38.382
Hmm?

29:40.079 --> 29:42.353
- Isn't this your favorite?
- Yeah, I know.

29:42.387 --> 29:44.689
Apparently I've, uh, outgrown it.

29:44.723 --> 29:46.357
Oh, yeah.

29:46.391 --> 29:48.960
I-I could've told you that since
the first time I saw you wear it.

29:48.994 --> 29:50.795
Ah. Yeah, well... [Chuckling]

29:50.829 --> 29:53.064
I guess I just wasn't ready
to hear it, huh?

29:53.098 --> 29:54.478
Hmm.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.604
Hey.

30:09.081 --> 30:10.414
[Grunts]

30:10.449 --> 30:12.750
Let's take this into the bedroom, yeah?

30:12.784 --> 30:14.151
Oh, yes. That's an excellent idea.

30:14.186 --> 30:16.654
Yeah. You go. Go.

30:16.688 --> 30:17.822
Go, go, go.

30:20.192 --> 30:21.993
Can I just say I'm glad you called?

30:22.027 --> 30:23.494
I didn't think you were going to.

30:23.529 --> 30:25.196
To be honest, I wasn't sure either.

30:25.230 --> 30:26.430
Why did you?

30:26.465 --> 30:28.399
I liked your boldness.

30:28.433 --> 30:31.235
Well, I've never been one
to follow the rules.

30:31.270 --> 30:34.272
Just like you with your throuple.

30:34.306 --> 30:36.240
You read my book.

30:36.275 --> 30:37.842
I hope that's not a bad thing.

30:37.876 --> 30:39.176
No, not at all.

30:39.211 --> 30:41.178
It just means you know a lot
more about me

30:41.213 --> 30:43.080
than I know about you.

30:43.115 --> 30:45.616
Well, it doesn't have to be that way.

30:46.285 --> 30:48.219
- What do you mean?
- Why don't we, uh, wipe the slate clean?

30:48.253 --> 30:49.754
I'll pretend I know nothing about you,

30:49.788 --> 30:51.355
you pretend you know nothing about me?

30:51.390 --> 30:53.457
That shouldn't be hard.
I know nothing about you.

30:53.492 --> 30:54.792
Right.

30:54.826 --> 30:57.094
Uh, my name is Adam. I'm a dentist.

30:57.129 --> 30:58.195
What do you do?

[Chuckles]

[Sighs]

31:06.905 --> 31:08.940
Sweetie... what's wrong?

31:09.795 --> 31:11.438
He blocked me.

31:11.458 --> 31:13.244
I tried calling Scott to hear
his side of the story,

31:13.278 --> 31:15.546
but it rang once and went to voicemail.

31:15.581 --> 31:16.814
That doesn't mean he blocked you.

31:16.848 --> 31:17.848
- His phone could be off.
- No, no, no.

31:17.883 --> 31:20.151
I read online about how
to disguise my number,

31:20.185 --> 31:23.321
so I called back. He picked up.

31:23.355 --> 31:25.790
I felt so humiliated, I just...
I hung up.

31:25.824 --> 31:28.259
Look, I think you're
better off, personally.

31:28.293 --> 31:30.895
You're probably right, I know, but...

31:30.929 --> 31:33.464
the truth is if he ever
finds out about this,

31:33.498 --> 31:35.466
he's just gonna keep on
feeling sorry for me.

31:35.500 --> 31:37.301
- Scott?
- No.

31:37.336 --> 31:39.570
- Harry.
- Okay, well, wait.

31:39.605 --> 31:41.806
- How did we get to Harry?
- [Scoffs]

31:41.840 --> 31:44.475
Because when I was a kid,
I worshiped him.

31:44.509 --> 31:46.344
He took care of me.

31:46.378 --> 31:48.179
All I ever wanted was to impress him

31:48.213 --> 31:50.348
because he was my cool older brother.

31:50.382 --> 31:52.183
Apparently nothing's changed.

31:54.150 --> 31:55.186
You should've seen how he looked at me

31:55.220 --> 31:56.354
when he heard I broke that lamp.

31:56.388 --> 31:58.135
Okay, you know that Harry loves you.

31:58.155 --> 32:01.158
Yes, but in a way that you love
a three-legged dog.

32:01.193 --> 32:04.829
Like... Like I'm some sad sack

32:04.863 --> 32:07.264
who has to live in his guest
house for the rest of my life.

32:07.299 --> 32:10.267
Okay, I doubt that. He's your brother.

32:10.302 --> 32:11.969
Harry will always have your back,

32:12.004 --> 32:13.437
and sometimes a three-legged dog

32:13.472 --> 32:16.207
needs to get out and meet
other three-legged dogs,

32:16.241 --> 32:20.111
and maybe then she'll realize
that she actually has four legs.

32:22.669 --> 32:24.915

Ooh, no. Uh, band's meeting early.

Well, this'll be good for later.

April, we need to talk.

32:48.196 --> 32:49.577
Okay.

32:51.266 --> 32:53.756
I've been doing a lot
of thinking, and, um,

32:53.976 --> 32:57.208
I still think that all of us
under the same roof is...

32:57.228 --> 33:00.017
- it's a bad situation.
- I told you.

33:00.052 --> 33:02.253
If you had a better idea, I am all ears.

33:02.287 --> 33:04.241
I think I should move out.

33:05.569 --> 33:06.590
What?

33:06.625 --> 33:09.326
Yeah, just... Just temporarily.

33:10.597 --> 33:13.364
Let's be realistic.
Your mom doesn't want me here.

33:13.398 --> 33:15.733
Now she's causing you and me to fight.

33:15.767 --> 33:17.401
I'm just worried that if I stay,

33:17.436 --> 33:18.720
things are gonna keep getting worse.

33:18.740 --> 33:20.037
I can't believe this.

33:20.072 --> 33:22.694
You're punishing me
for taking care of my mom.

33:22.714 --> 33:24.729
That's not what this is.
I'm doing this to take care of us.

33:24.749 --> 33:27.214
- By running away?
- I'm not running away.

33:27.234 --> 33:29.580
Well, that's what it feels like.

33:29.614 --> 33:33.417
When things get hard,
you don't just up and move out.

33:33.452 --> 33:35.047
You work through them.

33:35.067 --> 33:37.134
And if it was just you and me, I would.

33:37.169 --> 33:39.036
But this isn't a good
environment for me.

33:39.071 --> 33:40.571
I need some space.

33:41.717 --> 33:43.074
It's probably best for your mom, too.

33:43.108 --> 33:45.510
Don't use her as an excuse.

33:45.544 --> 33:48.853
If this relationship
is so hard to be in,

33:48.873 --> 33:50.870
maybe we shouldn't continue it.

33:51.213 --> 33:52.550
Okay, you're over-reacting.

33:52.584 --> 33:54.379
I'm over-reacting? Really?

33:54.399 --> 33:55.775
You're the one sprinting for the door,

33:55.795 --> 33:58.502

you've cooked up in your head,

33:58.537 --> 34:00.971
that is not gonna work for me.

34:01.006 --> 34:03.808
I'm a single mom.
I don't have room in my life

34:03.842 --> 34:07.311
for a relationship that's taking
a giant step backwards.

34:11.058 --> 34:13.717
I need to know if you're in or out.

34:14.494 --> 34:15.795
Don't do this, April.

away for a little while.

Maybe even moving back to Australia.

35:29.168 --> 35:31.426
What? Why?

caught up in our own...

35:43.339 --> 35:45.240
Our own stuff lately. You know what?

35:45.274 --> 35:48.009
We should all sit down
over a meal, reconnect.

35:48.678 --> 35:51.179

35:51.771 --> 35:53.348
Nothing. Just nothing.

Can we just sit down
for a second, please?

tell me what's going on.

36:17.807 --> 36:19.373

I'd be okay with that?

I didn't think. I just really liked him.

the right time to tell you,

36:31.087 --> 36:33.551

I figured she'd tell you.

37:57.940 --> 37:59.541
[Gasps] You playing?

37:59.575 --> 38:01.643
How was your day?

38:01.677 --> 38:03.049
Oh. Hi.

38:03.069 --> 38:05.880
I'm looking for... Karen, hey.

38:05.915 --> 38:07.582
Forgot your dessert.

38:07.617 --> 38:08.817
Please, come in.

38:08.851 --> 38:10.552
Adam, this is Lydia.

38:10.586 --> 38:12.387
You must be Vivian's nanny.

38:12.421 --> 38:15.290
- Hello.
- [Chuckling] This must be Vivian.

38:15.324 --> 38:17.792
- [Chuckles]
- She's beautiful.

38:17.827 --> 38:19.227
[Coos]

38:19.262 --> 38:20.595
Thank you.

38:20.630 --> 38:22.130
Well, now that I've met your daughter,

38:22.164 --> 38:23.465
I guess we have to go on a second date.

38:23.499 --> 38:25.400
I guess so.

38:25.434 --> 38:27.711
[Vivian babbling]

38:27.731 --> 38:30.438
- Cutie pie.
- [Laughs]

38:30.473 --> 38:32.474
Hey, honey.

38:32.508 --> 38:35.010
Just thinking about going out for
a run. You want to come with?

38:35.044 --> 38:37.012
- You lied to me.
- [Keys jingle]

38:37.046 --> 38:38.013
Again.

38:38.047 --> 38:40.248
- [Cellphone ringing]
- Do not get that.

38:40.283 --> 38:42.651
I wasn't going to.

38:42.685 --> 38:45.320
You told me you didn't know
why Kate was moving out.

38:45.354 --> 38:46.755
I know about Scott.

38:46.789 --> 38:49.232
[Chuckles]

38:49.252 --> 38:50.517
I can't believe she told you.

38:50.537 --> 38:52.294
I can't believe you didn't. Joss.

38:52.328 --> 38:54.191
Okay, look, it was an
unfortunate situation, Harry,

38:54.211 --> 38:55.396
but I handled it, okay?

38:55.416 --> 38:57.287
Hey, this isn't one of
your P.R. messes, Joss.

38:57.307 --> 39:00.435
I'm not some 21-year-old
singer you can handle.

39:00.455 --> 39:02.212
This is my sister and this is us.

39:02.232 --> 39:03.725
Okay, but when I found out about it,

39:03.745 --> 39:05.229
you and I weren't exactly
in a great place,

39:05.249 --> 39:07.642
and so I made the decision
not to upset you, but now...

39:07.677 --> 39:10.161
Okay, stop pretending you're
doing me a favor, please.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.574
I'm not pretending anything.

39:11.594 --> 39:13.515
You know, you were the one
that said you never ever

39:13.549 --> 39:15.413
wanted to hear about Scott
ever after last year.

39:15.433 --> 39:17.410
Asking for his ring back
and dating my sister

39:17.430 --> 39:18.862
are slightly different things,
don't you think?

39:18.882 --> 39:20.741
Okay, well, I'm sorry that I, you know,

39:20.761 --> 39:24.592
once again failed to decipher
the code that is Harry, you know?

39:26.562 --> 39:27.992
Wow.

39:28.159 --> 39:30.899
You can't even admit that you're wrong.

39:31.208 --> 39:33.343
I guess you're so used to
keeping things from me

39:33.363 --> 39:35.804
that it doesn't seem wrong anymore.

39:38.674 --> 39:40.208
[Cellphone chimes]

39:40.242 --> 39:43.211
[♪♪]

39:47.683 --> 39:48.650
What are you doing?

39:48.684 --> 39:50.585
- I got to go.
- Are you serious?

39:50.619 --> 39:53.292
Joss, what are you...
Okay, fine, yeah, good.

39:53.312 --> 39:54.989
Just go.
