WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:09.467
My name is Simón Marroquín.

00:10.552 --> 00:13.346
I'm taping this in case
something happens to me.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.056
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:15.140 --> 00:16.766
To be a perfect man,

00:17.767 --> 00:20.687
you need to know how to hide
your secrets perfectly.

00:22.522 --> 00:25.692
The problem with secrets
is that the darkest ones,

00:27.068 --> 00:28.069
they never die.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.739
They stalk us quietly,

00:31.406 --> 00:33.533
waiting for just the right time

00:34.784 --> 00:36.286
to take revenge.

01:48.733 --> 01:51.486
No way! All of that for a private dance?

01:51.569 --> 01:53.655
-First time?
-Can you tell?

01:56.616 --> 01:58.034
Manny, baby.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.130
Scram!

02:12.799 --> 02:15.426
-Who's the jerk that grabbed my butt?
-Godoy?

02:16.386 --> 02:17.303
He's a moron.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.224
Your next show is in an hour. Some dust?

02:21.808 --> 02:22.892
Just a little.

02:24.018 --> 02:25.645
How about a duet with Lucy?

02:30.400 --> 02:31.651
Will it cost me more?

02:32.318 --> 02:33.695
-Twice as much.
-No way.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.989
Aren't your friends big shots?

02:36.072 --> 02:39.742
But I paid your airfare, the hotel.
They'll ask questions.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.915
Nobody questions a prosecutor.

02:46.457 --> 02:49.669
You got that right.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.798
But I want to see everything.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.341
Everything?

02:56.092 --> 02:58.219
Why? What for?

02:59.721 --> 03:04.726
I have no drugs with me.
I'm on a vacation. I swear.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.396
Why are you doing this to me?

03:09.522 --> 03:11.357
Because I ate nothing on the flight?

03:12.108 --> 03:17.030
Last night's gig exhausted me
and I fell asleep.

03:18.031 --> 03:22.744
It says here that you run
a convenience store in Colombia.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.538
Yes. My grandparents own it.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.999
But I'm also a singer.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.484
Relax, take a deep breath.

04:03.826 --> 04:04.911
Patience.

04:15.296 --> 04:16.798
Hello.

04:17.757 --> 04:21.636
Apart from the table and the candles,
do you need anything?

04:21.719 --> 04:23.554
Drinking water, please.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.015
Fine. See you later.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.738
Tell me already!

04:40.822 --> 04:42.615
I'll fall!

04:43.199 --> 04:44.534
What's this?

04:47.829 --> 04:49.038
Wait, time out.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.041
An unexpected event
will make him change his mind.

04:53.167 --> 04:56.129
Charlie will ask me to marry him!

04:56.629 --> 04:58.464
He's going to dump you.

04:59.507 --> 05:02.010
Sorry, I can't lie
about what the cards say.

05:02.468 --> 05:05.013
No way, girl. Charlie is madly in love.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.348
Yes, but with another woman.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.684
Fuck you, bitch!

05:09.767 --> 05:12.812
-Carola! Sorry.
-She's such a…

05:12.895 --> 05:15.106
She's such a liar!

05:15.189 --> 05:18.484
How could Charlie dump me?
That's ridiculous.

05:20.111 --> 05:24.282
Our Father who art in heaven
hallowed by thy name…

05:25.116 --> 05:27.160
Yeah, he took off running…

05:27.243 --> 05:28.119
Hold on.

05:33.082 --> 05:34.417
Go right ahead, Mother.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.754
Go on. You're welcome. It's okay.

05:38.963 --> 05:40.715
So he went up the stairs…

05:42.592 --> 05:45.136
When you're inside, go upstairs.

05:45.845 --> 05:49.390
You'll see a window
covered up with newspapers.

05:50.808 --> 05:51.768
That's it.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.105
But walk slowly, try to go unnoticed.

05:56.981 --> 06:00.026
They all know who Chango is
and they protect him.

06:12.872 --> 06:18.378
Knock three times, wait, then once more,
so I'll know it's you.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.512
Are you sure Chango won't find out?

06:27.595 --> 06:30.515
It had to be today.
They kidnapped six more women.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.976
When they realize I'm gone,
we'll be far away.

06:37.563 --> 06:38.398
Put it on.

06:41.692 --> 06:45.363
-Caridad, it's too small.
-Let me see.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.868
Oh my God!
They'll kill me if they catch me.

06:51.953 --> 06:55.706
Two nuns are walking out of here.
We'll be fine. Put it on.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.584
You need to unfasten it first.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.062
-Was that her favorite song?
-Yes.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.571
Until we meet again, Mom.

08:38.476 --> 08:42.063
We're expecting
a Colombian police report tomorrow.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.982
But you can't keep me here
until tomorrow, right?

08:45.566 --> 08:48.903
No we can't, but if we need you,

08:48.986 --> 08:52.573
we'll pick you up at the hotel
you mention here.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.952
"Agua Marina." Be prepared.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.454
You're free to go.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.376
Thank you.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.685
Good afternoon, welcome.

09:27.525 --> 09:31.988
The Popess represents a mother,
or an important female protector.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.739
Don't mess with me, Carola.

09:33.823 --> 09:37.243
I can't mess with you,
but you can mess with my guy?

09:38.786 --> 09:40.788
It's my fucking party!

09:53.467 --> 09:55.595
You never thought it would end like this.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.766
You too, Mom! Get off of me!

10:04.645 --> 10:06.105
Any news, Lopez?

10:06.188 --> 10:10.234
All clear, Chango and his gang
are at the party on the top floor.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.485
Cover the rear.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.280
I'll take Castro and Maldonado
to the front.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.449
Copy that.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.999
What's happening?

10:27.793 --> 10:28.836
Lopez.

10:28.961 --> 10:32.048
Everybody on the floor!
You're under arrest!

10:38.763 --> 10:40.514
Lopez! Upstairs!

10:43.726 --> 10:46.395
Caridad, we're dead if it's a war.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.525
Next! Move it! You know what I mean.

10:54.570 --> 10:58.199
Lift your head up and smile. Hurry.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.326
-Police!
-On the floor, dude!

11:01.035 --> 11:03.996
-On the floor, dude!
-On the floor!

11:05.581 --> 11:07.124
On your knees!

11:11.671 --> 11:14.590
Chango, you bastard.
I finally got you, you scumbag.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.095
Don't go out there.

11:19.178 --> 11:23.349
I have to, Caridad.
I'd rather die than work for Chango.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.476
It's now or never.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.902
Open it. Let's do this.

11:42.243 --> 11:46.622
Easy, Sisters, we're police officers.
It's a raid. Put it down.

11:54.672 --> 11:58.008
I thought Lorenzo would go with you
to keep you company.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.220
They caught a guy
they were after for months.

12:01.303 --> 12:04.598
They heard Lorenzo was here,
so they asked him for help.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.101
Okay.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.857
Careful, boys!

12:19.155 --> 12:20.030
Listen, dear.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.325
I could stay, I don't have to leave yet.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.954
No, Aunt, you helped me a lot
by spending a whole month here.

12:27.037 --> 12:30.708
I'd go crazy in a month in Mexico City.

12:32.251 --> 12:36.172
She was my sister.
I did it with a lot of love.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.098
FATHER: UNKNOWN
MOTHER: ROSA MARTÍNEZ

12:46.182 --> 12:47.183
What's that?

12:50.227 --> 12:53.856
It's like my birth certificate,
but it says "father unknown."

12:58.194 --> 12:59.570
Did you know about this?

13:01.822 --> 13:02.740
Lucy!

13:03.866 --> 13:06.410
Damn it! Where are you?

13:09.413 --> 13:11.332
I know you like it. Right, bitch?

13:12.708 --> 13:13.542
Bastard!

13:20.966 --> 13:22.635
Fuck off, asshole!

13:27.848 --> 13:30.267
-I'll kick his ass!
-Calm down!

13:33.729 --> 13:37.066
Welcome to the Agua Marina Hotel.
Reservation number?

13:37.608 --> 13:40.736
I don't have one. Have you got a room?

13:40.820 --> 13:42.154
Let me see.

13:42.238 --> 13:46.575
Please, nothing more than 1000 or 1500.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.077
I'll take anything.

13:49.703 --> 13:50.579
I have something.

13:51.831 --> 13:52.665
Thanks.

13:53.749 --> 13:54.875
I can't believe it.

13:55.584 --> 13:59.380
I was fooled for 25 long years and I…

14:03.926 --> 14:06.512
Some investigative reporter I am.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.013
Don't say that, child.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.766
All my life I thought Marcos was my dad.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.309
Marcos was your dad.

14:14.353 --> 14:18.107
A dad raises you,
he doesn't just sire you.

14:19.608 --> 14:24.405
Marcos worshiped you from day one.
That's why he adopted you.

14:27.491 --> 14:28.325
Who was it?

14:30.286 --> 14:33.747
I want a name, date, place of birth,
whatever you know.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.374
Please tell me who it was.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.001
I know nothing, Valentina.

14:38.627 --> 14:39.712
I swear.

14:40.462 --> 14:44.091
Rosa wouldn't tell me anything
no matter how much I insisted.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.511
What does that matter now?

14:47.595 --> 14:50.848
She didn't tell her own sister
for a reason.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.643
Something dark
that no one could know about.

14:57.479 --> 14:58.981
I need to know what it is.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.068
You'll miss your bus.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.697
I can't leave you like this.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.492
I'll be okay when I get over the shock.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.296
Leave your message for Lorenzo Márquez.

15:22.379 --> 15:25.758
Lorenzo, it's me. Please call me.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.385
We need to talk.

15:31.221 --> 15:32.681
Detective Márquez.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.809
Lorenzo Márquez. Routine questions.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.607
When can we leave?
Are we under arrest? We're hungry.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.485
Be patient, Sister.

15:44.568 --> 15:48.155
We can't release you
until we process all the suspects.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.658
I'm sorry about this,

15:50.741 --> 15:54.870
but the raid could've been compromised
or you might've been hurt.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.422
What convent did you say you're from?

16:06.215 --> 16:10.427
Perpetual Help Convent,
Santa María de los Ángeles.

16:11.679 --> 16:12.972
I need your names.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.809
And the Mother Superior's name.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.771
This will cost you a fortune.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.233
You should make sure you get paid.

16:24.775 --> 16:28.404
I got paid in advance.
It's not my first bachelorette party.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.823
Do you live here in Cancún?

16:31.156 --> 16:34.660
-Temporarily. And you?
-No. I'm just here for this.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.998
What are you doing tonight?

16:39.415 --> 16:42.543
I'm going to hear a friend of mine
play at a bar.

16:42.626 --> 16:45.170
I'm taking a girl I just met.

16:46.296 --> 16:47.423
She's smoking hot.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.845
She can see the future.

16:52.928 --> 16:55.431
She might think I'll ask her out.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.894
I couldn't return your call earlier.
Is everything okay?

17:01.478 --> 17:04.773
Can we meet?
I need your help to research something.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.112
-We nabbed Chango.
-Were any women there?

17:10.195 --> 17:12.031
Yes, but Ana's not one of them.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.784
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

17:16.493 --> 17:19.747
We'll bump into her
in one of our raids, you'll see.

17:20.414 --> 17:24.960
Okay, but there must be photos, documents,
American contacts, we must find…

17:25.044 --> 17:26.587
I know the procedure.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.966
Think about it, stay at the hotel.
It's a nice room.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.761
We'll order some food,
have a drink and talk.

17:34.678 --> 17:37.598
You need to calm down
and you can't be alone.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.392
Yes, thanks, but…

17:41.477 --> 17:46.106
I still have a lot to do here.
See you tomorrow at the airport, bye.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.659
My driver will take you.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.622
You'll leave like the help does,
through the back door.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.001
There's some cash missing.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.087
Give me a break, Manny.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.714
You smash my client's face,

18:10.798 --> 18:13.801
interrupt your show,
and you want full pay?

18:14.384 --> 18:16.804
It's your asshole friend's fault.
Charge him.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.180
Deputy Godoy?

18:18.263 --> 18:20.015
-It's only fair!
-You're nuts.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.142
What's fair, girl?

18:24.394 --> 18:25.395
Let's go.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.358
Fucking whore.

18:50.254 --> 18:53.549
Of course I know them.
They're our congregation's nuns.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.553
They were on a mission. Are they okay?

19:03.183 --> 19:06.061
Thank you for protecting them, Detective.

19:06.895 --> 19:07.729
God bless you.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.108
What mess is Caridad in now?

19:11.942 --> 19:15.779
One that will cost me ten rosaries
as penance for covering up for her.

19:19.449 --> 19:20.576
-Here.
-Thanks.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.579
Where to, Sisters?

19:23.662 --> 19:26.582
We planned to return to Mexico City today.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.169
But we missed the bus because of this.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.088
And we have no money.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.883
Or a place to spend the night.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.184
It's a nice hotel.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.269
Certainly not, Detective.

19:47.352 --> 19:50.689
Sister Teresa and I
are not spending the night with you.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.274
Of course not.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.944
I'm spending the night at the precinct.
The room's yours.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.742
-Room 301.
-Thank you, Detective.

20:03.702 --> 20:07.372
Castro, take them to the Agua Marina!
Have a nice day.

20:07.456 --> 20:08.749
-Same to you.
-Enjoy.

20:17.090 --> 20:19.593
Are you from Spain or something?

20:20.177 --> 20:22.721
Your accent is kind of weird.

20:23.805 --> 20:24.932
I'm from Monterrey.

20:25.432 --> 20:29.770
When I was about 16
I moved to the Canary Islands.

20:29.853 --> 20:31.772
I came back four months ago.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.066
Now I live in Mexico City.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.860
So, why did you come back?

20:36.944 --> 20:40.280
The Canary Islands must be great, right?

20:42.074 --> 20:45.452
A city of 20 million people is great
if you don't want to be found.

20:49.748 --> 20:50.582
Your son?

20:53.126 --> 20:54.336
I see him once a month.

20:54.962 --> 20:58.257
My ex-husband got sole custody
because I'm a stripper,

20:58.340 --> 21:00.133
but guess how I met him.

21:01.009 --> 21:04.096
-Drunk, sticking bills in your thong?
-Exactly.

21:06.223 --> 21:09.935
That lady is a Mayan seer.

21:12.187 --> 21:14.189
I know because of her necklace.

21:14.273 --> 21:18.527
One of them did a tarot reading
for me many years ago.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.197
She said I'd become a nun.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.033
With Chango in jail,

21:25.117 --> 21:27.995
I don't need to take refuge
at the convent.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.624
He won't use me or any other woman
to make money.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.419
Where will you go, Teresa?

21:35.502 --> 21:38.588
I don't know. Maybe back to Chihuahua.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.804
Thanks for rescuing me.

21:48.557 --> 21:52.811
Promise to call us once in a while
to know how you're doing.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.440
And I'll send you this.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.943
Tell the Mother Superior
it's all my fault.

22:08.452 --> 22:09.369
Sorry!

22:18.045 --> 22:20.672
All my life I thought Marcos was my dad.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.342
Marcos was your dad.

22:27.012 --> 22:30.849
A dad raises you,
he doesn't just sire you.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.311
Like it, Dad?

22:34.394 --> 22:35.645
I LOVE YOU DAD

22:36.438 --> 22:37.564
Yes, honey.

22:37.647 --> 22:39.649
Then why are you crying?

22:40.442 --> 22:42.444
We cry when we're happy too.

22:57.334 --> 22:58.919
So you don't believe in fate?

22:59.795 --> 23:00.629
No.

23:01.671 --> 23:03.423
But I believe in coincidence.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.843
Nice coincidences like this.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.720
There's no such thing.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.515
But synchronism is real.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.268
Events that are connected to each other.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.189
You didn't come to Cancún
just for a hen party.

23:19.272 --> 23:20.690
We had to meet.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.360
Why?

23:26.822 --> 23:30.534
I don't know yet, but the night is young.

23:33.745 --> 23:37.290
Because Teresa called me.
I couldn't abandon her, Mother Superior.

23:37.374 --> 23:40.252
The guy found her
and made her work for him again.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.591
Because you'd never let me come to Cancún.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.802
No, I'm not going out.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.471
I'm just having dinner.

24:02.065 --> 24:04.359
Mamá Ela, it's me.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.696
How are you? How is Papá Antonio?

24:09.614 --> 24:11.700
I'm fine. I'm in Mexico.

24:12.576 --> 24:15.328
I couldn't get a SIM card to phone you.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.040
Okay. Fine. No. It's okay.

24:19.499 --> 24:24.671
Just keep pretending you know nothing
and you think something happened to me.

24:26.089 --> 24:28.175
I miss you too, Granny.

24:30.218 --> 24:31.094
Bye.

24:46.693 --> 24:51.740
Do you really have to leave?
The barman can't take his eyes off of you.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.577
After those jerks today…

24:59.206 --> 25:00.373
I prefer a woman.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.669
I'm right there if you want me.

25:05.962 --> 25:07.631
And if not, bye, honey.

25:09.841 --> 25:10.675
Good luck.

25:18.642 --> 25:19.476
What's wrong?

25:20.060 --> 25:21.186
Nobody bites here.

25:35.450 --> 25:36.952
Is this seat taken?

25:59.641 --> 26:02.102
Hey. Am I getting lucky tonight?

26:04.646 --> 26:05.480
What?

26:06.231 --> 26:07.065
What?

26:13.905 --> 26:15.907
You're leaving? The check!

26:18.910 --> 26:19.786
Hey!

26:26.751 --> 26:29.462
-Can I please have a cigarette?
-Excuse me.

26:29.546 --> 26:30.547
The check!

26:43.351 --> 26:44.769
-Who is he?
-Is he gone?

26:46.021 --> 26:48.106
Yes, but who is he?

26:49.024 --> 26:50.483
Please don't ask me that.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.374
Mr. Márquez isn't answering.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.671
But he left your name just in case.

27:13.548 --> 27:14.382
Thanks.

27:16.384 --> 27:17.552
Is there a bar?

27:17.636 --> 27:21.097
The lounge is next door.
You can leave your suitcase here.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.432
-Really?
-Yes.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.776
Shot! Shot! Shot!

27:35.195 --> 27:36.905
-Come, sing with me.
-Okay.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.156
Here we go!

27:41.868 --> 27:43.244
Hello.

27:43.953 --> 27:45.205
For the next song,

27:45.288 --> 27:49.709
I'd like to invite a Colombian singer
who just arrived in Cancún.

27:50.794 --> 27:53.672
Here is Matilde Heredia.

28:18.571 --> 28:19.864
Tequila, please.

28:29.416 --> 28:30.750
Another tequila, man.

28:39.008 --> 28:40.009
Thanks.

28:40.093 --> 28:42.554
-Hi. Want to dance?
-I'm good.

29:37.650 --> 29:39.235
Let's go swimming!

30:09.516 --> 30:10.433
What's your name?

30:18.024 --> 30:21.736
-Sorry. Did I say something wrong?
-No. It's me. Sorry.

30:23.112 --> 30:26.032
-No. Please don't go.
-No. Really.

30:26.115 --> 30:28.952
At least tell me your name!

30:50.640 --> 30:51.850
Lorenzo, it's me.

30:52.517 --> 30:55.854
I'm sorry. You were right.
I can't be alone.

30:57.313 --> 31:00.024
-Lorenzo!
-What? It wasn't me!

31:01.734 --> 31:04.612
It's my fault.
I told Lorenzo I couldn't come.

31:06.948 --> 31:11.786
So you and the detective are dating?

31:11.870 --> 31:14.706
No, he's a good friend of mine.

31:15.999 --> 31:19.502
I'm so sorry I startled you.
I'll let you sleep.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.632
Listen.

31:26.050 --> 31:29.178
You don't have to leave. Stay if you want.

31:29.846 --> 31:33.224
I'm used to sharing my bed
with the girls at the convent.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.852
And we're not exactly strangers.

31:35.935 --> 31:39.772
You're Lorenzo's friend
and I saw you at the beach.

31:40.356 --> 31:44.402
I saw you too.
I never thought you were a nun.

31:45.028 --> 31:47.614
Not a nun, a novice.

31:49.991 --> 31:51.326
Valentina, right?

31:51.826 --> 31:54.579
Juana Valentina de la Paz
is my full name, Sister.

31:54.662 --> 31:58.708
What are the odds!
I'm Juana too. Juana Caridad.

31:59.584 --> 32:00.627
Nice to meet you.

32:01.419 --> 32:06.174
During his recent press conference
the president launched his proposal

32:06.257 --> 32:08.468
of appointing a new Justice Minister…

32:09.302 --> 32:10.178
Your son?

32:11.346 --> 32:12.722
I see him once a month.

32:12.805 --> 32:16.017
My ex-husband got sole custody
because I'm a stripper,

32:16.100 --> 32:18.019
but guess how I met him.

32:18.102 --> 32:22.106
Mr. Marroquín, how does it feel
to be nominated Minister of Justice?

32:22.607 --> 32:24.609
Being Minister of Justice

32:24.692 --> 32:28.154
is the greatest acknowledgment
for someone in my position,

32:28.237 --> 32:30.949
and I am honored
that the president included me

32:31.032 --> 32:34.118
in his shortlist of three candidates
to the Senate.

32:34.202 --> 32:38.915
Are you flying to Cancún tomorrow
to meet the president, Mr. Marroquín?

32:38.998 --> 32:42.794
No, it's strictly a business trip,
but I understand

32:42.877 --> 32:47.006
the president will be in town,
so we might have a meeting.

32:47.090 --> 32:49.425
Thanks. Anything you'd like to add?

33:01.270 --> 33:02.981
Caridad, it's an earthquake!

33:03.064 --> 33:05.566
Hurry! We need to get out of here!

33:06.526 --> 33:08.486
-Caridad, for God's sake!
-Coming.

33:08.569 --> 33:10.113
Where are you going?

33:10.196 --> 33:14.325
-I'm not leaving in my pajamas.
-Hurry, for God's sake!

33:14.409 --> 33:18.830
Please evacuate immediately.
Do not use the elevators.

33:18.913 --> 33:20.248
Hurry, Caridad!

33:20.331 --> 33:24.502
Please evacuate immediately.
Do not use the elevators.

33:26.629 --> 33:28.798
I don't know what you mean.

33:29.590 --> 33:33.428
I don't know if I have birthmarks.
I'm a novice, remember?

33:33.511 --> 33:36.556
My birthmark is on the same cheek
and it's fish-shaped too.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.224
Isn't that weird?

33:39.017 --> 33:39.851
Come.

33:39.934 --> 33:40.810
Thanks.

33:42.770 --> 33:45.732
-Please think a little.
-Thank you very much.

33:49.027 --> 33:49.861
Hey.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.782
Remember the girl that just sat?

33:54.866 --> 33:58.703
The one with light-colored eyes
at the beach party?

33:58.786 --> 34:00.288
I don't know her. Why?

34:00.371 --> 34:06.002
They say she has a birthmark
like a fish on her butt just like yours.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.388
Hi, I'm Juana Bautista Mai.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.640
We were at the party at the bar.

34:20.808 --> 34:24.854
My friend heard you guys talking
about a birthmark on your butt.

34:25.438 --> 34:28.608
Nobody else in my family has it
and they're inherited.

34:29.525 --> 34:32.195
My great-grandmother called it my destiny.

34:32.278 --> 34:36.032
Lots of people have birthmarks.
Caridad, please.

34:36.115 --> 34:37.408
A fish?

34:40.745 --> 34:41.954
Are yours like this?

34:56.135 --> 34:57.887
My name is Juana too.

34:58.471 --> 34:59.472
And her's.

35:00.973 --> 35:02.391
Can I see it, please?

35:13.486 --> 35:14.654
It's identical.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.039
Hey!

35:27.208 --> 35:28.626
My birthmark is identical.

35:30.628 --> 35:31.629
In the same spot.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.052
We have it too.

35:39.846 --> 35:42.098
And all three of us are called Juana.

35:43.558 --> 35:44.684
What the hell!

35:46.727 --> 35:47.562
Listen up.

35:48.062 --> 35:49.730
Is anybody else named Juana?

35:50.898 --> 35:55.069
With a fucking fish-shaped birthmark
on their butt?

37:41.926 --> 37:44.387
