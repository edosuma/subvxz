WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:07.541
I'm dropping the boys over at
Henry and Frank's around 6:00,

00:07.575 --> 00:09.043
Right.
and then cabbing it
to the hotel.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.511
What do you mean you're
cabbing it, babe?

00:10.544 --> 00:12.480
You going to cab it all the way
from Bay Ridge?

00:12.513 --> 00:14.215
I'll have both
our suitcases.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.584
Babe, but it's from Bay Ridge
all the way into the city.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.186
That's a very expensive
cab ride, honey.

00:18.219 --> 00:21.089
The whole weekend is
free of charge, Danny.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.457
No, the room, the food
and the show are free of charge.

00:23.491 --> 00:26.094
But you've got your incidentals,
honey, and they add up.

00:26.127 --> 00:30.264
You really want your wife
schlepping two suitcases
on the subway?

00:31.265 --> 00:35.236
No. I want my wife
to be relaxed--

00:35.269 --> 00:37.571
all weekend long.

00:37.605 --> 00:41.542
So we can make
sweet, sweet love.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.244
Now that's more like it.
Love you.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.778
Love you more.
Love you most.

00:44.812 --> 00:47.115
Don't forget this.
It's supposed to shower.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.416
Babe, there's not
a cloud in the sky.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.218
Trust your wife.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.153
Thermos. It's on the roof.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.421
All right.

01:01.462 --> 01:02.563
I'm taking
Lizzie's shift tonight

01:02.596 --> 01:04.665
so I won't be home
till 8:00 or so.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.600
Bring something
for supper.

01:06.634 --> 01:09.370
If you get kibble for the cat.
Do you need some money?

01:09.403 --> 01:12.273
No, I've got work today.
Timmy Kelly's cousin
came through?

01:12.306 --> 01:14.074
It looks that way.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.611
Text you later.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.613
Love you.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.349
(thunder rumbling)

01:25.486 --> 01:27.421
HENRY:
How does this sound?

01:27.455 --> 01:29.623
Museum of Natural History,

01:29.657 --> 01:33.294
then the Intrepid, then dinner,
then tickets to a Broadway show

01:33.327 --> 01:35.496
I can't remember the name of,

01:35.529 --> 01:38.132
but my ticket guy says
is the hottest show in town?

01:38.166 --> 01:39.400
What about nap time?

01:39.433 --> 01:41.235
The boys are too old
for naps, Francis.

01:41.269 --> 01:42.670
I meant for us.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.472
Ah.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.807
Oh, hey, you home for dinner?

01:46.840 --> 01:49.377
Erin and Nicky want
to cook for everybody.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.245
Is that a promise
or a threat?

01:51.279 --> 01:54.215
I'll have a backup.

02:25.213 --> 02:27.381
Reagan, you decent?

02:27.415 --> 02:29.483
Depends who you ask.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.652
The cell you were issued when
you went undercover at the bar,

02:31.685 --> 02:32.520
they wanted to reassign it,

02:32.553 --> 02:34.288
but there's voice mail
for you on it.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.224
Five messages the last
couple of days

02:36.257 --> 02:38.959
from a Noble Santino,
something like that.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.127
Sanfino. Yeah.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.564
The guy O.D.'d. I called a bus,
took him to the hospital.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.799
Yeah, you want
to call him back?

02:45.833 --> 02:48.502
I want to think about it.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.438
Can I hold on to it?

02:50.471 --> 02:51.805
Sign it out in the log.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.307
Let me know when you're
done with it.

02:53.341 --> 02:54.408
You got it, Sarge.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.787
MAN:
Heads up, everybody.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.856
That's our bump up ahead--
the green Explorer.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.324
(horn honking)

03:10.358 --> 03:11.759
Here we go.
(horn honks in response)

03:11.792 --> 03:14.495
Okay, everybody,
brace yourself.
(phone ringing)

03:31.912 --> 03:33.514
(woman screaming)
MAN:
Oh!

03:39.920 --> 03:40.988
WOMAN:
Is everyone all right?

03:41.021 --> 03:43.357
(groans)
MAN: What the hell's
the matter with you?!

03:43.391 --> 03:45.459
You just stopped for no reason!
You hit me!

03:45.493 --> 03:46.694
The middle
of the street!

03:46.727 --> 03:50.364
(groans)

03:50.398 --> 03:52.300
Yeah, I'd like to report
an accident.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.410
Somebody call an ambulance!

04:39.780 --> 04:42.783
I'm not sure. We just called him
Scotty, you know.
Scotty.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.018
Yeah.
On account of
he was Scottish?

04:45.052 --> 04:46.887
Yeah, with the accent.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.456
Right, except it was
an Irish accent.
Huh?

04:48.489 --> 04:50.458
His name was Liam Keogh.
He was from Dublin, Ireland.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.993
I thought he was Scottish.
Yeah, I'm sure you did.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.862
And how long has this guy

04:54.895 --> 04:56.830
been hired on to your
painting crew?

04:56.864 --> 04:58.566
I don't know-- recently.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.901
I can barely stand.
I really got to see a medic.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.503
Go on, get out
of my face.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.338
Make sure you get
good I.D. on him.

05:04.372 --> 05:07.775
All right, same story from
all the guys in the Explorer.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.042
Yeah, of course.

05:09.076 --> 05:12.112
Yeah, is this
what it looks like?
Well, we got a painting crew

05:12.145 --> 05:13.881
with not a drop of paint
on their shoes,

05:13.914 --> 05:16.617
and we got half a soccer team
on their way to a game

05:16.650 --> 05:18.752
without a ball or a single
pair of cleats in sight.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.488
And we've got one that
rear-ended the other,

05:20.521 --> 05:22.590
and not an inch
of a skid mark.

05:22.623 --> 05:25.393
Yeah, it looks a lot more like
a date than an accident.
Wonderful.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.461
(man groaning)
Look at this performance.

05:27.495 --> 05:28.862
Oh, my arm is killing me!

05:28.896 --> 05:32.032
Bravo. Bravo.
Encore.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.401
(loud groan)

05:33.434 --> 05:35.703
Oh.
Yeah.

05:38.906 --> 05:42.643
How it works is, they then
get seen by the clinic

05:42.676 --> 05:45.779
who set up the bogus
accident in the first place.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.815
The clinic pays the victims

05:47.848 --> 05:49.517
a little something
for their troubles,

05:49.550 --> 05:51.485
while at the same time,
bilking Medicaid

05:51.519 --> 05:54.922
out of tens of thousands of
dollars for every phony claim.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.425
The thing is this time,
it just happened to go bad.

05:57.458 --> 06:01.695
Oh, Liam.

06:01.729 --> 06:04.965
Tess, did Liam ever say
anything about this to you?

06:04.998 --> 06:06.967
Did he ever come home
flush with cash--

06:07.000 --> 06:08.068
you know, the kind of cash

06:08.101 --> 06:09.937
he couldn't make
from a day's work?

06:12.506 --> 06:14.642
There was this clinic
he went to,

06:14.675 --> 06:16.610
every couple weeks,
to sell blood.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.879
He was some rare type.
They paid him pretty good.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.815
JACKIE: And they recruited
him for the big show.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.984
You got a name,
would he have a card at home?

06:24.017 --> 06:26.186
No. I had to go
get him once.

06:26.219 --> 06:30.424
He was too dizzy
after he gave.

06:30.458 --> 06:34.027
It's on Delancey.

06:34.061 --> 06:37.765
Hygienic Medical,
something like that.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.567
Okay, thank you.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.402
We're sorry for your loss.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.645
Thanks a lot.
Yeah.

06:51.679 --> 06:54.615
(phone ringing)

06:58.886 --> 06:59.853
Hello?

06:59.887 --> 07:06.059
(laughing) Oh, I had just about
given up on you.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.461
Who's this?

07:07.495 --> 07:09.530
Only a guy owes you his life.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.965
Noble!
Jimmy, how are you, man?

07:11.999 --> 07:13.834
Hey, I'm hanging in there.
How about you?

07:13.867 --> 07:16.837
Long story short, just got out
of 30 days in rehab.

07:16.870 --> 07:20.541
But it's like the whole
world's in high-def.
(radio squawks)

07:20.574 --> 07:22.610
Where are you?

07:22.643 --> 07:24.712
Subway.
I'm gonna lose you.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.947
All right, real quick,
reason I called--

07:26.980 --> 07:29.149
I want you to come out to dinner
on Saturday night.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.918
We've got a new chef
at my restaurant,

07:30.951 --> 07:32.219
we're doing a soft opening,
big dinner,

07:32.252 --> 07:33.453
friends and family.

07:33.487 --> 07:37.991
Uh, tomorrow?
Yeah-- I've been trying
you all week, man.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.661
Thing is, I've got a thing.
So move the thing.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.796
Look, I want to say thank you,
and so does my family.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.899
All right, look,
I'll see what I can do.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.067
Later.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.836
All right.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.816
DANNY: I'll say it again,
Dr. Roth--

08:02.850 --> 08:05.953
Liam Keogh is not covered by
doctor-patient confidentiality.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.855
He's not a patient,
he's a corpse.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.022
Which is a tragedy
that neither I

08:09.056 --> 08:11.091
nor any of my staff
had a hand in.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.960
Why don't you let us
take a look at his records.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.094
The moment I see
your subpoena.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.797
Oh, so you really want to play
hide and go seek with me?

08:16.830 --> 08:18.999
No, Detective, I want
to get back to work.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.268
I've got lawyers for this==
good ones and lots of them.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.936
I suggest you contact them--
my secretary

08:22.970 --> 08:25.606
will be happy to...
give me the runaround.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.575
Like you're doing.

08:27.608 --> 08:30.978
You see my waiting room.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.013
I treat the left-behind, the
fallen through the cracks,

08:33.046 --> 08:34.715
the uninsured.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.116
In what kind of world

08:36.149 --> 08:38.285
is an honest healer on
the top of the suspect list?

08:38.318 --> 08:40.087
Do I get a lollipop
with that story?

08:40.120 --> 08:42.723
Good day, Detective.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.101
Any luck?

08:54.134 --> 08:55.869
No. they're so
tight-lipped around here

08:55.903 --> 08:58.572
I think they're on the verge of
a major medical breakthrough.

08:58.606 --> 09:01.108
Oh, yeah, the cure
for low cash-flow.
Yeah.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.745
Be sure to wear your neck brace
at all times, Mrs. Alvarez,

09:04.778 --> 09:06.714
especially out of the house,
where someone might see you.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.148
(laughing)

09:08.181 --> 09:09.817
ALVAREZ:
See you soon.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.119
Okay. Thanks.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.196
Excuse me.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.802
My G.G.'s.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.005
Did you get the
Shark WeekDVD?

09:32.039 --> 09:34.241
All cued up in the sun room.
Oh, boy, let's go.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.076
I'll be... with you
you in a minute.

09:36.109 --> 09:39.112
I can't tell you how much I
appreciate you taking the boys.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.014
The pleasure's all mine,
believe you me.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.617
Where's Frank?
He's in with Jamie
having a father-son.

09:43.651 --> 09:46.920
Okay, then, a few things you
need to know about the boys.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.155
First of all, Sean won't
eat anything green.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.790
You got to watch him
with that.
Mm-mm.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.159
Have you talked to OCCB?

09:52.192 --> 09:54.227
No, I want to
talk to you first.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.064
I have no interest in breaking
my own chain of command.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.167
I know that.
This is vet to rookie.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.201
Okay.

10:01.234 --> 10:04.104
(sighs deeply)

10:04.137 --> 10:05.973
What do you want to do?

10:06.006 --> 10:07.240
Part of me--

10:07.274 --> 10:09.009
turn back the clock,

10:09.042 --> 10:12.212
never meet that guy undercover
in that bar in the first place,

10:12.245 --> 10:14.715
never take him to the hospital
when he O.D.'d,

10:14.748 --> 10:15.849
never take his phone call.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.384
Not an option.

10:17.417 --> 10:20.754
I want to step up...

10:22.022 --> 10:24.157
...but my stomach goes in knots.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.093
You scared or anxious?

10:26.126 --> 10:28.662
Well, both, I think.

10:28.696 --> 10:31.699
Comes with.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.034
But what's that make me
if I don't?
If you mean chicken,

10:34.067 --> 10:35.969
that's a playground taunt.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.906
Any particular
call to duty

10:38.939 --> 10:40.273
has to be measured against

10:40.307 --> 10:45.012
what you truly believe
you're ready for and capable of.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.147
Going undercover

10:47.180 --> 10:50.183
to hang with mobsters is
serious business.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.989
In anybody's book.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.703
It's supposed
to be brown on top.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.739
This looks more like
a spray-on tan.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.140
I would put it back in,

11:13.173 --> 11:15.108
turn the oven up
to 450, and maybe

11:15.142 --> 11:17.377
grab the takeout menus
from the drawer on the left.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.478
(sighs)

11:21.481 --> 11:24.317
Aren't you supposed to be in
some fancy hotel indulging

11:24.351 --> 11:25.853
your every whim?

11:25.886 --> 11:27.154
Yeah, well,
Danny caught a case.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.488
And I had to school
the tribal elders

11:28.521 --> 11:29.489
on the boys' routine.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.158
How did that go?

11:31.191 --> 11:32.292
How do you think?

11:32.325 --> 11:34.227
Henry looked at me like I was
some kind of tiger mom.

11:34.261 --> 11:34.962
(chuckles)

11:34.995 --> 11:38.131
I'm gonna go say hey
to the boys.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.733
You guys are way overdue
for this weekend.

11:39.767 --> 11:42.235
I know.

11:42.269 --> 11:45.305
And yet I'm not sure why.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.909
We used to plan
a "dirty weekend"

11:48.942 --> 11:51.044
every month or so;
time out to be

11:51.078 --> 11:52.245
boyfriend
and girlfriend,

11:52.279 --> 11:53.413
you know, keep

11:53.446 --> 11:55.883
that whole thing going.

11:55.916 --> 11:56.884
It's been a while.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.452
A little rusty?

11:59.486 --> 12:05.158
It's just... I mean, can you
really put aside kids

12:05.192 --> 12:07.928
and the money worries
and the job, on cue,

12:07.961 --> 12:08.962
after all this time?

12:08.996 --> 12:13.333
Well, I hear it's just like
riding a unicycle.

12:13.366 --> 12:16.269
(chuckles)

12:16.303 --> 12:18.071
(keypad beeping)

12:20.573 --> 12:24.812
(phone line ringing)

12:26.213 --> 12:28.281
This is Noble.
You know the drill.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.383
Hey, Noble, Jimmy.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.451
I moved that thing
around.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.053
I'd love to join you
tomorrow night.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.822
Leave me a message
with the when and where.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.356
Later.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.893
HENRY:
Dinner!

12:43.330 --> 12:45.198
DANNY:
"Or what"?

12:45.232 --> 12:47.400
"Or what" is I call
your parole officer

12:47.434 --> 12:50.203
and I ask if you practicing
without a license

12:50.237 --> 12:52.105
at a Medicaid mill is
a violation of your parole,

12:52.139 --> 12:53.473
that's what.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.242
What do you think
the answer's gonna be?

12:55.275 --> 12:57.244
Okay, yeah, they set it up.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.380
Of course, no one was
supposed to die.

13:00.413 --> 13:01.314
Well, somebody did die.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.250
But you're never
gonna find a paper trail.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.018
They got, like,
a dozen of these

13:05.052 --> 13:06.386
doc-in-a-boxes,
all with a legit side.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.220
These guys are smart.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.321
Well, I have you.

13:08.355 --> 13:09.890
And you're gonna record
a conversation

13:09.923 --> 13:11.291
between you and Dr. Roth.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.226
And you're gonna get him
to give you some
little nugget

13:13.260 --> 13:15.562
or at least to say
that he knew about
this in advance.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.597
And that makes me smarter.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.300
You know, I should've just
done the full nickel

13:20.333 --> 13:21.468
the first time you busted me.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.303
Now it's like I'm your
snitch for life.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.437
Will you give me a break?

13:24.471 --> 13:26.239
If it wasn't for
the kindness of my heart

13:26.273 --> 13:27.407
you'd be in Bedford Women's
right now,

13:27.440 --> 13:28.575
scamming for Nicorette.

13:28.608 --> 13:29.977
Yeah, well, I quit smoking.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.144
Do you think I'm joking?

13:31.178 --> 13:34.014
I got a dead guy and I want
to know who's responsible.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.248
Now you are gonna get me
something

13:35.282 --> 13:36.850
that I can use on tape

13:36.884 --> 13:38.318
from Dr. Roth.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.587
You do that, you'll bank
some serious good will with me.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.955
Now call him.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.123
Now.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.491
Relax!

13:46.393 --> 13:47.494
Fine.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.531
What is it, exactly,

13:51.564 --> 13:53.000
you think you're
gonna accomplish

13:53.033 --> 13:54.467
with this physical
therapy scam anyway?

13:54.501 --> 13:56.203
You're not gonna
make any real money

13:56.236 --> 13:57.337
doing that, are you?

13:57.370 --> 13:59.372
Visiting nurse service.

13:59.406 --> 14:02.409
Oh, boy...
All I need is
a couple of rich gimps.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.476
You hear about these
guys falling

14:03.510 --> 14:04.912
for their nursie
all the time.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.014
You are a real piece of work.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.415
(phone rings)

14:08.448 --> 14:10.050
Oh.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.118
Dr. Roth.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.319
Go ahead, answer it.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.221
You know, I've never had
a Jewish guy.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.522
It's kind of on my bucket list.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.457
Answer the phone.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.929
Hola, Glenn. (chuckles)

14:21.962 --> 14:23.897
Thanks for calling me back.

14:23.931 --> 14:26.199
Yes, your offer for dinner.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.168
Um, are you free tonight?

14:29.436 --> 14:32.906
Great. Um, let's say

14:32.940 --> 14:37.344
Cask 24 on Metropolitan
at 8:30.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.446
No, no, I'm already here.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.215
Okay, see you then.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.350
(chuckles)

14:43.383 --> 14:45.085
Now, was that so difficult?

14:45.118 --> 14:46.920
Of course not.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.521
He's been trying to get
in my pants

14:48.555 --> 14:50.457
since the minute
he set eyes on me.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.661
DANNY: I know I said
I wouldn't be late,

14:54.694 --> 14:57.564
but they were just a couple of
kids fresh off the boat, honey.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.631
I don't know.

14:58.665 --> 15:01.001
She reminded me of you.
Who knows?

15:01.034 --> 15:02.402
Different circumstances,
they could've been us.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.104
How were they us, Danny?

15:04.137 --> 15:04.972
I don't get it.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.407
I mean,
we were both born in America,

15:07.440 --> 15:09.576
and you didn't get yourself
killed in a fake accident.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.611
I don't know.
They were Irish, okay?

15:11.644 --> 15:13.313
You know what I mean, honey.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.514
I know what you meant,

15:14.547 --> 15:16.416
and I love that you care,
I do.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.351
It's just, right now,
I don't give a rat's...

15:18.385 --> 15:20.353
Half-hour tops.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.989
Okay?

15:22.022 --> 15:23.056
Did you eat yet?

15:23.090 --> 15:24.958
No, and I'm starving.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.129
Listen, Danny...

15:29.162 --> 15:32.399
don't blow this, okay?
Please?

15:32.432 --> 15:33.566
I'm begging you.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.402
I won't, I won't.

15:35.435 --> 15:39.672
Dr. Roth, where
are you going?

15:57.457 --> 16:00.493
You see that young lady
I was with?

16:08.068 --> 16:10.170
Rosalita! Hey!

16:12.472 --> 16:13.706
Sorry.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.063
Hey, pretty girl
around five-five,

16:36.096 --> 16:37.297
she go out that door?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.298
Couple of minutes ago.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.566
Was she with anyone?

16:39.599 --> 16:41.568
Nah, she was by herself.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.604
Damn it!

16:47.640 --> 16:49.409
(sighs)

16:54.681 --> 16:58.218
Oh, that's so good.
(groans)

16:58.251 --> 17:01.188
I was up till 3:00 skip-tracing
her all over town.

17:01.221 --> 17:04.224
Oh, yeah, right there.
You got anything?

17:04.257 --> 17:05.692
Her phone had nothing
outgoing or incoming

17:05.725 --> 17:07.227
after 9:30 last night.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.795
Ooh! Danny!

17:08.828 --> 17:11.731
All right. You know what? Her,
um, her CI registration form's

17:11.764 --> 17:14.301
probably got two other working
aliases on it. Why don't you see

17:14.334 --> 17:16.436
if there's any cell phones
registered in those names?

17:16.469 --> 17:18.271
Yeah, I'm pulling them up now.
All right, what else?

17:18.305 --> 17:20.273
Danny?
One second, babe.

17:20.307 --> 17:22.675
LINDA:
Oh, that feels good.
Right there.

17:22.709 --> 17:23.743
Oh, right there! Oh!

17:23.776 --> 17:25.645
Well, it's gonna be tough

17:25.678 --> 17:27.480
getting to Roth
without her help.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.249
Yeah!

17:29.282 --> 17:30.850
Special Frauds has had charges
against him

17:30.883 --> 17:32.352
dropped twice
on account of the way

17:32.385 --> 17:33.653
his lawyers have him set up.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.388
You know, nothing goes
straight back to him.

17:35.422 --> 17:36.423
Right.

17:36.456 --> 17:37.824
Danny, could you get
off the phone

17:37.857 --> 17:40.160
for a little bit of take it in
the other room, please?

17:40.193 --> 17:41.294
One second, honey.
Okay, get dumps on

17:41.328 --> 17:42.262
Roth's phone, see what pops up.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.264
Maybe he might have made her
a better offer.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.099
If he did, he'll probably
check in with her.

17:46.133 --> 17:46.866
Yeah, okay.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.768
All right.
That feels good.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.303
Sorry.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.705
In couples massage,
we encourage couples

17:52.739 --> 17:54.341
to talk to one another only.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.842
Right.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.144
You're very tense here.

17:57.177 --> 18:00.513
(inhales sharply)
You think?

18:02.382 --> 18:05.318
Okay, the tickets were in
your...

18:05.352 --> 18:07.854
...inside left breast pocket
where I always keep tickets.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.489
You look in all your coats?

18:09.522 --> 18:10.890
Even ones I don't wear.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.792
Raincoat, maybe?
I'll remember.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.627
Just give me a minute.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.833
Hey, Erin took that course
at John Jay to help witnesses

18:20.867 --> 18:22.735
with their recall.
Let's get her over here.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.641
We'll have backup in

18:28.675 --> 18:29.642
the immediate area,

18:29.676 --> 18:31.878
but we can't get a ghost in
there with you.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.181
You're on your own once
you're at the location.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.718
This kit contains a valid
driver's license

18:38.751 --> 18:40.620
for Jimmy Riordan and two
working credit cards.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.256
We'll be taking your photos down
from all the NYPD databases

18:43.290 --> 18:44.524
and putting up a substitution.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.893
Uh, Lieutenant, so we're clear,

18:46.926 --> 18:48.695
I'm just getting
my feet wet here,

18:48.728 --> 18:50.263
I'm not committing
to a career undercover.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.199
Right.
And though it's highly unlikely,

18:52.232 --> 18:54.367
if you find yourself in a
situation where

18:54.401 --> 18:56.369
a crime is being committed
or about to be,

18:56.403 --> 18:57.937
you're to steer clear
of any interference.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.306
So just play dumb?

18:59.339 --> 19:00.607
No, there's
a difference.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.609
You can take information in,
you just can't

19:02.642 --> 19:03.943
actively participate in
the course of events.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.478
Do you understand?

19:05.512 --> 19:06.546
Yes.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.917
Philip Sanfino,
that's your guy.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.820
Don't get taken in
by the "Uncle Philly" act.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.488
He's a sociopath in
a Brioni suit.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.557
But if you can make
a favorable impression

19:17.590 --> 19:19.426
in the kind
of intimate family
gathering this

19:19.459 --> 19:22.895
reads like, then you've jumped
us over a lot of quicksand.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.664
Got it.

19:24.697 --> 19:25.965
Eyes wide open.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.767
Check.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.872
Good luck.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.842
Yes, they'd be in an envelope.

19:35.875 --> 19:39.246
A small envelope.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.781
It has advertising on it--
a credit card, I think.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.950
Yes. So now you're taking
the envelope

19:43.983 --> 19:45.585
out of your pocket.

19:45.618 --> 19:46.986
Try to visualize the room,

19:47.019 --> 19:51.224
the other objects

19:51.258 --> 19:54.527
as you're placing
the envelope down.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.533
Am I supposed to be seeing
something?

20:02.435 --> 20:04.837
Take your time.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.980
All I can see are those little
white dots you see

20:14.013 --> 20:15.482
when you close your eyes.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.288
(clears throat)

20:21.321 --> 20:23.990
Let's try this again.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.295
(Noble laughs)

20:28.328 --> 20:29.829
You took the train?

20:29.862 --> 20:31.731
Hey.
I would've
picked you up, man.

20:31.764 --> 20:32.932
No problem.
How are ya?

20:32.965 --> 20:35.268
Good... in my new ride.

20:35.302 --> 20:36.603
Ooh, nice.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.371
You like it?
It's yours.

20:38.405 --> 20:41.708
Okay, but I'm gonna
trade it in for something

20:41.741 --> 20:44.411
slightly less top-gun
orthodontist.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.012
Oh, look at that!

20:46.045 --> 20:46.946
It started with the car.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.948
Yeah, I was kidding
about the car, but look,

20:48.981 --> 20:51.518
let me be serious for a second,
and just don't interrupt me

20:51.551 --> 20:53.286
because I suck at being serious.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.021
Got it.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.424
Thank you...

20:57.457 --> 20:58.625
for saving my life.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.259
You're welcome.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.330
Okay, you're done.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.997
Okay, good.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.536
* I've told the truth

21:09.569 --> 21:14.006
* I didn't come to fool you

21:14.040 --> 21:18.845
* And even though
it all went wrong *

21:18.878 --> 21:22.649
* I'll stand before
the Lord of Song *

21:22.682 --> 21:29.021
* With nothing on my tongue
but "Hallelujah" *

21:30.122 --> 21:32.992
It's my sister Bianca.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.562
Don't want what
you can't have.

21:36.729 --> 21:40.767
* Hallelujah

21:40.800 --> 21:46.373
* Hallelujah.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.844
(song ends)

21:55.915 --> 21:58.985
Come on, sing something
from Mamma Mia!

21:59.018 --> 22:01.554
Exactly.

22:01.588 --> 22:03.122
Jimmy Riordan.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.124
Thanks for saving my
brother's life, I guess.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.125
Oh...

22:06.158 --> 22:07.860
That was really,
really good.

22:07.894 --> 22:10.062
That was really, really not.
You don't have to suck up to me,

22:10.096 --> 22:11.464
I don't have any
juice around here.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.665
Whoa. Sorry.

22:12.699 --> 22:16.369
And if anyone yells
for Mamma Mia! or "Volare,"

22:16.403 --> 22:19.005
I am walking off stage,
I swear to God.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.006
We'll make an announcement.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.474
Thank you.
No problem.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.510
Later.

22:28.748 --> 22:29.916
Don't take it personally.

22:29.949 --> 22:33.886
It's her time of the month
every day of the month, lately.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.055
Angie, due Sambuca?

22:36.088 --> 22:38.124
No.
Uno, grazie.

22:39.526 --> 22:40.827
You can still drink.

22:40.860 --> 22:44.431
Yeah. It wasn't Sambuca
that put me in the hospital.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.566
But I am doing the 12 steps.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.601
And step nine is what we
are doing here tonight.

22:48.635 --> 22:50.069
Making amends.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.038
In person, if possible.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.807
So that's why I'm here.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.142
You, I needed to thank.

22:56.175 --> 22:59.979
That guy who sold me
the bad mash,

23:00.012 --> 23:01.981
I need to make amends
with him, too.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.851
But... different.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.487
He's coming here tonight?

23:07.520 --> 23:09.055
You got a problem with that?

23:09.088 --> 23:11.190
No.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.493
I'm not sure where
we're meeting up.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.728
But I am not asking
you to get involved.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.797
Okay? I know you don't
have a beef with him.

23:17.830 --> 23:18.665
Got a beef with anybody who

23:18.698 --> 23:20.099
puts a friend of mine
in the hospital.

23:22.769 --> 23:23.903
Then you'll enjoy the show.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.973
Salud.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.687
Why aren't we going
to the play?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.054
Well, the lesson
there is,

23:42.088 --> 23:44.223
never hide anything
like tickets so well

23:44.256 --> 23:45.224
even you can't find them.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.026
So what else about restaurants
should we know

23:47.059 --> 23:49.195
besides no mayo on pastrami?

23:49.228 --> 23:50.797
You can order lobster
at a steakhouse,

23:50.830 --> 23:52.799
but never order steak
at a lobster shack.

23:52.832 --> 23:56.235
And never the chili in
a fast-food chain, ever.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.971
And you should learn to cook
a couple of things for yourself,

23:59.005 --> 24:00.973
because there'll be
a few years between

24:01.007 --> 24:02.942
eating in a restaurant
on your parents' dime

24:02.975 --> 24:05.211
and when you'll be able
to afford it on your own.

24:05.244 --> 24:07.113
When does that happen?
After high school.

24:07.146 --> 24:09.682
What do we cook?
Sandwiches, mostly.

24:09.716 --> 24:11.884
But you should know how to
make dinner for a girl.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.152
Really?
Really?
Really.

24:13.185 --> 24:14.754
Linguini with garlic and oil,

24:14.787 --> 24:17.824
a simple salad,
good bread.

24:17.857 --> 24:21.193
How long are we going to be too
poor to eat in a restaurant?

24:21.227 --> 24:23.496
Well, you won't be poor,
exactly, but you'll be paying

24:23.530 --> 24:27.667
for everything that used to come
free, so you'll feel strapped.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.135
That sounds kind of scary.
Not really.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.870
But always remember this:

24:30.903 --> 24:33.706
if a month comes when you can
make rent or the car payment,

24:33.740 --> 24:36.543
but not both, make the car
payment, because you can

24:36.576 --> 24:38.778
live in your car, but you
can't drive your house.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.514
And no matter how great a deal
it sounds, never buy anything

24:41.548 --> 24:44.183
from someone who's
out of breath.

24:44.216 --> 24:45.117
Who's for dessert?

24:45.151 --> 24:47.887
I am.
I am.
Eat your vegetables first.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.122
What are we doing next?

24:50.156 --> 24:52.258
A little live-bait night
fishing on the pier,

24:52.291 --> 24:55.161
followed by a private screening
of a great American Western,

24:55.194 --> 24:57.229
sodas and popcorn included.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.098
Yes!
I thought so.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.107
Excuse us a sec.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.108
NOBLE:
Sure, Uncle Philly.

25:09.141 --> 25:11.143
Come on.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.648
So Riordan, huh?
Yeah.

25:23.322 --> 25:24.657
How do you spell that?

25:24.691 --> 25:27.326
R-i-o-r-d-a-n.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.796
You got any family, Jimmy?

25:29.829 --> 25:31.898
Uh, no, I'm single.
No, no, no.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.099
Family you come from.

25:33.132 --> 25:36.803
Oh. Uh, my father,
my brother, my sister.

25:36.836 --> 25:38.004
Your mother?

25:38.037 --> 25:39.271
She passed away.

25:39.305 --> 25:40.807
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.009
I miss her every day.
Yeah.

25:46.345 --> 25:48.314
There's one thing I don't get.

25:48.347 --> 25:51.584
You take Noble to the hospital,
you get him checked in...

25:51.618 --> 25:54.821
yet you don't wait around
for someone to get there.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.756
Not sure I understand
the question.

25:59.892 --> 26:00.860
What was the hurry?

26:00.893 --> 26:02.962
No hurry.

26:02.995 --> 26:05.031
I just thought, an overdose,
they'd probably notify the cops.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.866
The cops want to question me,

26:06.899 --> 26:08.901
do I know this, did I see that?

26:18.110 --> 26:19.912
Good.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.614
Good...

26:21.648 --> 26:23.616
Noble.
Yeah?

26:23.650 --> 26:25.117
Come inside.
NOBLE:
Right.

26:29.656 --> 26:30.723
(clears throat)

26:30.757 --> 26:31.724
Excuse me. Excuse me.

26:31.758 --> 26:34.627
Everybody.
Thank you, thank you.

26:34.661 --> 26:37.296
Good evening.
Welcome, everyone.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.031
Before my beautiful niece

26:39.065 --> 26:42.001
Bianca serenades us,
I wanted to introduce

26:42.034 --> 26:43.936
a very, very special guest.

26:43.970 --> 26:46.839
Jimmy, here, is
the Good Samaritan

26:46.873 --> 26:51.377
who we have to thank for Noble
being alive to host us tonight.

26:51.410 --> 26:53.612
(applause, cheering)

26:56.182 --> 26:58.217
So...

26:58.250 --> 27:02.054
Jimmy, from the bottom
of all our hearts,

27:02.088 --> 27:03.322
molto grazie.

27:03.355 --> 27:04.356
ALL:
Cheers.

27:04.390 --> 27:05.825
Salud.

27:05.858 --> 27:06.859
Thank you.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.861
Prego, Signor Sanfino.

27:08.895 --> 27:09.896
(laughs)

27:09.929 --> 27:11.363
Pretty good for
a Mick, huh?

27:11.397 --> 27:13.132
(all laughing)

27:13.165 --> 27:15.134
(soft piano music playing)

27:15.167 --> 27:19.205
So, you know the Farleys
from the next block over?

27:19.238 --> 27:21.373
They listed their
house for $499,000.
They'll never get it.

27:21.407 --> 27:23.976
Though, it'd be nice
for us if they did.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.878
Mm-hmm.

27:25.912 --> 27:28.247
(cell phone buzzing)

27:35.221 --> 27:36.823
Go ahead, Danny, get it.

27:42.261 --> 27:43.395
Go, Jack.

27:43.429 --> 27:44.697
All right, Tara has one of

27:44.731 --> 27:46.699
Rosalita's alias cells
triangulated.

27:46.733 --> 27:48.968
She's at, uh, 29th and Madison.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.937
There's a hotel on
the southeast corner,

27:50.970 --> 27:52.438
probably your location.

27:52.471 --> 27:54.306
Roth's tracking
from Forest Hills

27:54.340 --> 27:56.843
and towards the
59th Street bridge.

27:56.876 --> 27:58.845
All right.
Can you stay with it?

27:58.878 --> 28:02.715
I told you, it's my mom's
birthday. I can't stand her up.

28:02.749 --> 28:03.682
DANNY:
Of course.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.384
Look, I got my laptop
at the hotel, okay?

28:05.417 --> 28:07.754
Just zip everything
over to me there.

28:07.787 --> 28:08.788
All right. Sorry, partner.

28:08.821 --> 28:09.956
DANNY:
Don't say sorry.

28:09.989 --> 28:11.190
Come on, it's your
mom's birthday.

28:11.223 --> 28:12.324
Tell her happy birthday
from me and Linda.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.960
JACKIE:
Sure.

28:13.993 --> 28:17.429
Bye-bye.
The theater's on 44th, between

28:17.463 --> 28:19.465
Broadway and 8th.

28:20.499 --> 28:22.334
You're a pal.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.737
South side of
the street. Yeah.

28:24.771 --> 28:28.007
Okay, I'll see you there.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.009
So Lisa's going to
meet me there.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.779
Which means you're off
the hook for the show.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.949
I hope you understand, Linda.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.719
It is what it is.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.929
BIANCA:
* I heard there was

28:49.962 --> 28:52.398
* A secret chord

28:52.431 --> 28:56.235
* David played,
and it pleased the Lord *

28:56.268 --> 28:58.437
(phone buzzes)
* But you don't really care

28:58.470 --> 28:59.438
Hey, there.

28:59.471 --> 29:01.440
* For music, do you?

29:01.473 --> 29:03.876
Yeah. Yeah.
No, just, uh...

29:03.910 --> 29:05.945
just take him to the place
that we talked about.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.547
And listen to me:
I do not want a scratch on him

29:08.580 --> 29:10.082
till I get there.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.151
Uh, around 10:00.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.386
Okay.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.423
* Hallelujah

29:17.456 --> 29:21.560
* Hallelujah...
hallelujah *

29:21.593 --> 29:22.795
Hey.

29:22.829 --> 29:26.298
Is she as good as any one of
those American Idols or what?

29:28.167 --> 29:29.201
Definitely.

29:29.235 --> 29:35.842
* Hallelujah...

29:49.188 --> 29:50.823
Look, Linda...

29:50.857 --> 29:52.825
I always love you.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.962
I don't always show it.

29:55.995 --> 30:00.599
Tonight I can't show it
the way you deserve, but I do.

30:00.632 --> 30:04.170
You know, when I married you,

30:04.203 --> 30:07.173
I knew I would have to share you
with the job on some nights.

30:07.206 --> 30:08.841
Right.

30:08.875 --> 30:11.610
I'm just sad that tonight
is one of those nights.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.512
Me, too.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.348
Because you look amazing
in that dress.

30:18.084 --> 30:22.188
It's a little short, but...
I actually kind of like that.

30:22.221 --> 30:24.223
It is short.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.059
And I'm not wearing
any underwear.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.964
(laughing)

30:31.998 --> 30:34.867
All right. So there's a party
at Tabu, and then I got a table

30:34.901 --> 30:36.235
for the late show
at the Blue Note.

30:36.268 --> 30:37.569
Then I'm in.
I call shotgun.

30:37.603 --> 30:38.504
No, no, no!

30:38.537 --> 30:40.907
Girls cannot call
shotgun in a Porsche.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.541
What?
Come on, I don't mind.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.543
You are such a jerk.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.378
Come on.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.414
Fine.
What are you doing?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.601
NOBLE:
All right.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.137
Wait here.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.205
Why?
'Cause I asked you to.

31:13.239 --> 31:14.640
Then can Jimmy wait with me?

31:14.673 --> 31:17.509
If he wants.

31:21.013 --> 31:22.915
It won't be long.

31:24.683 --> 31:26.118
I get shotgun, then.

31:29.455 --> 31:31.490
Let's go, Jimmy.

31:31.523 --> 31:33.525
Be back in a minute.

31:39.665 --> 31:42.401
Richie.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.336
You look like crap.

31:44.370 --> 31:45.671
I'm so sorry, man.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.339
Please, let me
make it up to you.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.108
Oh. Yeah.

31:49.141 --> 31:51.010
You're gonna.
RICHIE:
Please.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.178
Yeah, because of you,

31:52.211 --> 31:55.347
I spent two nights
in the hospital,

31:55.381 --> 31:58.084
and then got sent up
for 30 days in rehab.

31:58.117 --> 32:01.153
I got that stuff from my
usual guy. I had no idea...

32:01.187 --> 32:03.222
Because of you,
my life didn't just

32:03.255 --> 32:04.957
fall off the rails, man.

32:04.991 --> 32:06.092
I-It went down the embankment,

32:06.125 --> 32:08.460
through the orphanage, and
into the gas tanks. I mean...

32:08.494 --> 32:11.063
I ought to kill you.

32:12.198 --> 32:13.432
RICHIE:
Please...
But...

32:13.465 --> 32:16.535
step nine of the 12 steps

32:16.568 --> 32:19.171
instructs us
to make amends.

32:20.506 --> 32:23.675
So... let's you and
me make amends, huh?

32:43.262 --> 32:45.231
No...
Yeah.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.500
(chuckles)

33:01.580 --> 33:04.016
It's on me.

33:04.050 --> 33:06.218
No...

33:16.662 --> 33:17.463
(grunts)
Come on.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.631
Come on, Richie,
down the hatch now!

33:19.665 --> 33:21.167
Come on!

33:21.200 --> 33:22.101
Richie, come on!

33:22.134 --> 33:23.735
(chuckles):
Oh. Do it.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.537
(grunts)
Okay, okay, fine.
Do you want to know

33:25.571 --> 33:27.573
what my friends here really
wanted to do with you?

33:27.606 --> 33:28.607
(grunts)
No?

33:28.640 --> 33:30.209
Take your medicine
then, buddy.

33:30.242 --> 33:32.711
Come on. Go! Go!

33:32.744 --> 33:34.046
(inhales)

33:35.247 --> 33:36.348
(sighs)

33:36.382 --> 33:38.250
All right.

33:38.284 --> 33:40.252
(coughs)
Okay, okay.

33:40.286 --> 33:42.754
Take it easy, huh?

33:42.788 --> 33:44.190
What's in it?

33:44.223 --> 33:47.393
Oh, it's, uh, crystal meth.

33:47.426 --> 33:50.496
And some smack to,
uh, counter the meth.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.499
And a heaping helping of
pure LSD so the whole thing

33:53.532 --> 33:56.335
will be a
lasting memory.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.204
How we doing, Rich?

33:58.237 --> 34:00.506
(laughing)

34:16.455 --> 34:17.823
Hey.

34:17.856 --> 34:19.491
Over here.

34:19.525 --> 34:20.826
What are you doing here?

34:20.859 --> 34:22.428
I told you I got this.

34:22.461 --> 34:23.629
I don't work on
your timetable,

34:23.662 --> 34:24.763
you work on mine,
you understand?

34:24.796 --> 34:25.764
Now light up.

34:25.797 --> 34:26.732
I told you, I quit.

34:26.765 --> 34:28.200
And I'm assuming
you told Roth

34:28.234 --> 34:29.335
you were going for
a smoke, right?

34:29.368 --> 34:31.670
So you better smell of smoke
when you go back upstairs.

34:34.173 --> 34:36.375
What the hell happened
to you last night?

34:36.408 --> 34:39.445
Glenn got a call,
I think, about the accident.

34:39.478 --> 34:40.679
So he had to book.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.681
What the hell
does that mean?

34:42.714 --> 34:44.350
I didn't feel like
dealing with you,

34:44.383 --> 34:46.218
so I slipped out
the back.
Why?

34:46.252 --> 34:48.487
I like the guy, okay?

34:48.520 --> 34:50.789
I needed a little more time
to think this through.

34:50.822 --> 34:53.392
Oh, you like the guy,
so you screw me over instead.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.494
Glenn and his family
lost all their money to Madoff.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.163
You think I give
a rat's ass

34:57.196 --> 34:58.897
what that scumbag
lost to Madoff?

34:58.930 --> 35:00.199
So he's got a story.

35:00.232 --> 35:02.434
And he's attractive
and he's Jewish,

35:02.468 --> 35:03.902
so I decided to sleep with him.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.471
Where's my evidence?

35:05.504 --> 35:08.640
I can't screw the guy
before I do the guy.

35:08.674 --> 35:10.176
It's got to be
the other way around.

35:10.209 --> 35:11.243
I got a code, too.

35:11.277 --> 35:12.478
Okay, here's the
deal, Rosalita.

35:12.511 --> 35:14.513
You're gonna get me a tape
in the morning

35:14.546 --> 35:16.415
or your ass will be
in Rikers by lunch.

35:16.448 --> 35:17.416
You follow me?

35:17.449 --> 35:18.517
Don't test me again.

35:18.550 --> 35:19.518
Cool your jets.

35:19.551 --> 35:20.519
Don't test me again.

35:20.552 --> 35:21.520
I will bury you.

35:21.553 --> 35:23.755
Where do you want me to drop it?

35:23.789 --> 35:25.891
Drop it at the Dandridge hotel
at the front desk.

35:25.924 --> 35:28.360
Cop can afford the Dandridge?

35:28.394 --> 35:31.630
The wife and I won
a romantic weekend together.

35:31.663 --> 35:34.266
So what are you doing here?

35:34.300 --> 35:36.768
That's a good question.

35:36.802 --> 35:39.405
I got this.

35:39.438 --> 35:40.539
Okay?

35:40.572 --> 35:42.341
You better.
Go.

35:48.247 --> 35:51.217
Now, be a good boy and
take your medicine.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.218
(grunts)

35:52.251 --> 35:53.919
Come on. Come on!

35:53.952 --> 35:55.221
(sniffs)

35:55.254 --> 35:57.789
(pants, chokes)

35:59.858 --> 36:01.893
(gasping)

36:01.927 --> 36:03.629
(laughs)

36:03.662 --> 36:04.696
Shh-shh-shh.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.332
(grunting)

36:06.732 --> 36:08.400
Are those bats?!

36:08.434 --> 36:09.501
(screams)
Whoa!

36:09.535 --> 36:11.937
(both screaming)

36:11.970 --> 36:13.905
(laughs)

36:13.939 --> 36:15.741
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.776
I'm yanking your
chain, dude.

36:17.809 --> 36:19.245
Come on.

36:19.278 --> 36:21.647
Bats?

36:21.680 --> 36:24.350
(laughs)

36:24.383 --> 36:25.351
All right.

36:25.384 --> 36:26.452
(sighs)

36:27.286 --> 36:29.288
(groaning)

36:31.423 --> 36:32.724
Just gonna leave him here?

36:38.730 --> 36:40.899
Cut him.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.638
Loose.

36:46.672 --> 36:47.906
Cut him loose.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.342
(chuckles):
Come on.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.548
Knock-knock.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.652
Linda?

37:00.686 --> 37:04.423
LINDA: You dropping by
or you staying?

37:04.456 --> 37:06.392
I'm staying.

37:06.425 --> 37:08.627
How was the show?

37:08.660 --> 37:10.296
Really good.

37:10.329 --> 37:11.463
You missed it.

37:11.497 --> 37:12.798
Yeah?

37:15.467 --> 37:18.937
Sorry about, uh, you know,
messing things up tonight.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.940
Whatever, Danny.

37:21.973 --> 37:23.809
Will you put on SNL?

37:23.842 --> 37:25.311
I hear Alec Baldwin's
hosting.

37:25.344 --> 37:28.280
Sure.

37:28.314 --> 37:30.316
I brought dessert.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.256
So did I.

37:59.978 --> 38:04.350
(The Magnificent Seven theme
playing over TV)

38:04.383 --> 38:05.784
FRANK:
Think they had fun?

38:05.817 --> 38:07.486
HENRY:
Of course they did.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.655
I can remember you
and Grandpa took me

38:09.688 --> 38:13.525
for a night on the town
when I was about their age.

38:13.559 --> 38:17.329
We went to see Spartacus
at the old Rivoli

38:17.363 --> 38:19.998
and had dinner
at Jack Dempsey's.

38:20.031 --> 38:23.535
I've still got the picture
somewhere of you and the champ.

38:23.569 --> 38:24.703
You were ten.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.372
And the two of them
had advice for me.

38:26.405 --> 38:27.373
HENRY:
Oh, yeah.

38:27.406 --> 38:28.640
And it always ended with,

38:28.674 --> 38:30.409
"But don't tell your mother
I said that."

38:32.444 --> 38:34.446
I know where the tickets are.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.348
Oh.

38:38.684 --> 38:40.419
Okay.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.754
If you ever got tickets
to a musical,

38:42.788 --> 38:45.657
it would've been for Mom,
not yourself.

38:45.691 --> 38:48.827
So you would've put them
where she kept her treasures.

38:48.860 --> 38:52.798
The wooden box over the fridge.

38:57.102 --> 38:58.404
Voila.

38:58.437 --> 38:59.571
(sighs)

38:59.605 --> 39:00.639
ERIN:
Very impressed.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.976
Grandpa, you got them tickets
to The Book of Mormon?

39:05.010 --> 39:06.512
What? It's a Broadway musical

39:06.545 --> 39:08.514
about some American missionaries
in Africa.

39:08.547 --> 39:09.681
Okay, well, I've seen it;
it's not for kids.

39:09.715 --> 39:10.682
You dodged a bullet.

39:10.716 --> 39:11.817
I think that's
a little overstated.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.018
Oh, well, that depends

39:13.051 --> 39:15.020
on your appetite
for explaining jokes

39:15.053 --> 39:17.456
about Jesus, AIDS,

39:17.489 --> 39:19.491
the finer points of
the female anatomy

39:19.525 --> 39:20.926
to your grandsons.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.494
Really?
Mm-hmm.

39:22.528 --> 39:23.495
Oh.

39:35.106 --> 39:37.108
(knock on door)

40:11.109 --> 40:13.579
(humming)

40:13.612 --> 40:15.180
And how was your stay,
Dr. Roth?

40:15.213 --> 40:17.683
Just perfect, thank you.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.217
Here's a copy of your bill.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.520
Do you need any help with
luggage or transportation?

40:21.553 --> 40:23.054
We have his ride
right here.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.990
What are you doing here?

40:25.023 --> 40:26.458
Glenn Roth, you're under arrest

40:26.492 --> 40:28.193
for criminally
negligent homicide

40:28.226 --> 40:29.795
in the death of Liam Keogh.

40:29.828 --> 40:30.862
Ah, this is ridiculous.

40:30.896 --> 40:31.997
(handcuffs click)

40:32.030 --> 40:33.231
I want my lawyer.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.166
Well, you're gonna
need a new one of those.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.668
We're arresting
your lawyer, too.

40:36.702 --> 40:39.004
You're gonna regret this,
Detective.

40:39.037 --> 40:40.639
Not as much as you.

40:40.672 --> 40:43.609
We'll get his bags.

40:50.816 --> 40:52.684
Hey!

40:52.718 --> 40:54.686
BOTH:
Mom! Dad!

40:54.720 --> 40:56.655
Oh.
Hey.

40:56.688 --> 40:58.156
You guys behave?
Yeah.

40:58.189 --> 40:59.625
They were angels.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.527
Yeah, right.
No kidding.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.595
Dad, you have to see
The Magnificent Seven.

41:03.629 --> 41:04.530
It's the best movie ever.
Magnificent Seven--

41:04.563 --> 41:06.665
I already saw that movie
when I was your age.

41:06.698 --> 41:09.134
And I saw it with the same
two old cowboys as you.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.235
Really?
Where's Dad?

41:10.268 --> 41:11.670
He's with Jamie,
in the living room.

41:11.703 --> 41:12.671
All right.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.005
Dinner in 15.
All right.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.842
It was pretty brutal.

41:16.875 --> 41:17.976
Guy's okay?

41:18.009 --> 41:19.645
Yeah, he's in
King's General-- stable.

41:19.678 --> 41:21.947
I guess the apple doesn't fall
far from the family tree.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.281
That's the thing,
though.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.250
Isn't the wise guy way like,
"You put one of ours

41:25.283 --> 41:27.218
in the hospital, we put
one of yours in the morgue"?

41:27.252 --> 41:28.219
Noble didn't do that.

41:28.253 --> 41:29.855
What are you getting at?

41:29.888 --> 41:31.823
Just that this was more
"an eye for an eye."

41:31.857 --> 41:32.991
Biblical, not gangster.

41:33.024 --> 41:35.026
Still pretty damn sadistic.

41:35.060 --> 41:36.294
Yeah.
All right,

41:36.327 --> 41:37.929
so what are you
gonna do about it?

41:37.963 --> 41:40.699
Only thing I can do.
Wait for OCCB to put me back in.

41:40.732 --> 41:42.701
You still have a choice.
You can still walk away.

41:42.734 --> 41:44.736
Not if I want
to really contribute.

41:45.737 --> 41:47.272
Dinner.
