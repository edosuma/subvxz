<i>Carmen?</i>

00:17.346 --> 00:19.047
Oh,<i> mon dieu,</i>
you look <i> magnifique.</i>

00:19.148 --> 00:20.428
Thanks.

00:20.483 --> 00:22.851
I'm going on a talk show
to promote my new album,

00:22.952 --> 00:24.219
and I can't decide
what to wear.

00:24.320 --> 00:25.720
Wear this.

00:25.821 --> 00:27.722
<i>Mon coeur,</i>
what happened to our plan?

00:27.823 --> 00:29.424
You were supposed to
seduce Jacklyn.

00:29.525 --> 00:32.726
I know. I couldn't go
through with it.

00:32.828 --> 00:34.162
She's been nothing
but nice to me.

00:34.263 --> 00:36.064
Is that why you haven't
returned any of my calls?

00:36.165 --> 00:37.699
No, I lost my stupid phone.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.334
Oh, I thought you were
mad at me.

00:39.435 --> 00:41.302
Where was the last place
you had it?

00:41.404 --> 00:43.004
- If I knew, it wouldn't be lost.
- Oh, let's see.

00:43.105 --> 00:46.274
The last text you sent was...

00:46.375 --> 00:48.076
when you were with Jacklyn.

00:48.177 --> 00:51.179
Oh, my God. I left my phone
at your house!

00:51.280 --> 00:54.049
It's okay.
I'll go home and find it.

00:54.150 --> 00:56.051
What if she already did?

00:59.321 --> 01:02.123
- Thank you, Thomas.
- Is everything okay?

01:04.427 --> 01:05.894
Remember when I said

01:05.995 --> 01:07.962
I thought my husband
was having an affair?

01:08.064 --> 01:12.901
Well, I finally know
who he's been screwing.

01:13.002 --> 01:15.737
And the bitch is gonna pay.

01:19.809 --> 01:22.811

01:30.396 --> 01:31.630
Oh, there you are.

01:31.731 --> 01:34.700
Mr. Michael came to take
Katy for the weekend

01:34.801 --> 01:36.401
and she couldn't find
her dolly.

01:36.502 --> 01:38.470
It's in my car.
Uh, I'll get it to her.

01:38.571 --> 01:41.039
- She was very upset.
- Oh.

01:41.140 --> 01:43.442
I tried calling you,
but you didn't answer.

01:43.543 --> 01:46.445
Sorry, I was, uh, at the gym.

01:46.546 --> 01:49.715
And I had my...
phone turned off.

01:49.816 --> 01:53.018
You've been going to
the gym a lot lately.

01:53.119 --> 01:54.486
Every afternoon.

01:54.587 --> 01:56.455
Yes, since the separation,

01:56.556 --> 01:59.358
the... exercise has helped
clear my head.

01:59.459 --> 02:01.660
I have
a really great... trainer.

02:01.761 --> 02:03.161
That's good.

02:03.262 --> 02:06.031
Anyway, uh,
I'm gonna take a shower.

02:06.132 --> 02:08.265
Oh, wait.
I'm doing laundry.

02:08.368 --> 02:10.088
You want me to throw in
your gym clothes?

02:10.136 --> 02:11.536
Where is your bag?

02:11.637 --> 02:13.672
I must've left it at the gym!

02:13.773 --> 02:16.675
It's okay.
I'll call the gym for you.

02:16.776 --> 02:18.176
Which one is it?

02:18.277 --> 02:21.179
You know what?
I don't wanna trouble you.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.714
I'll call them myself.

02:26.753 --> 02:31.056
Uh, sorry to interrupt.
Carmen Luna to see you...

02:31.157 --> 02:32.557
without an appointment.

02:32.658 --> 02:35.027
You know,
it's not a good time, Carmen.

02:35.128 --> 02:38.563
I just wanted to ask you if
I left my phone at your house.

02:40.767 --> 02:42.234
You did.

02:42.335 --> 02:45.470
Yeah, I found it
between the sofa cushions.

02:45.571 --> 02:49.408
Thank God! I've been looking
for this everywhere.

02:49.509 --> 02:50.642
Did your husband call me?

02:50.743 --> 02:52.463
I'm sure he's been trying
to reach me.

02:52.478 --> 02:53.945
Excuse me?

02:54.047 --> 02:56.081
Why would Sebastien be
trying to reach you?

02:56.182 --> 02:58.316
Oh, he's my realtor.

02:58.418 --> 03:00.252
He didn't tell you?

03:00.353 --> 03:02.154
So...

03:02.255 --> 03:04.589
Let me get this straight.

03:04.690 --> 03:07.125
Out of all the realtors
in town,

03:07.226 --> 03:08.560
you chose my husband?

03:08.661 --> 03:10.095
Mm-hmm. I wanna buy a condo.

03:10.196 --> 03:12.264
And you told me that
he was in real estate.

03:12.365 --> 03:13.698
So I thought you'd be happy.

03:15.134 --> 03:16.334
Was that wrong?

03:24.410 --> 03:28.080
I am... so relieved.

03:28.181 --> 03:30.415
I mean, you... wow.

03:30.516 --> 03:34.219
You wouldn't <i> believe</i>
what's been going on in my mind.

03:34.320 --> 03:38.490
I...you're so...
Such a beautiful woman and...

03:38.591 --> 03:40.525
Sebastien is...

03:40.626 --> 03:42.746
Wait, you... you thought
I would... with your husband?

03:42.795 --> 03:45.530
No, no, I know.
I know, it's so stupid!

03:45.631 --> 03:47.999
I mean, I was gonna murder you.

03:48.101 --> 03:50.101
I'm glad you didn't.

03:50.136 --> 03:53.505
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I assumed the worst.

03:53.606 --> 03:55.373
Can you forgive me?

03:55.475 --> 03:57.175
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Of course I forgive you.

03:57.276 --> 03:58.556
Oh! Thank you.

04:00.179 --> 04:02.414
Ah! Well...

04:02.515 --> 04:06.251
Now that that's out of
my system,

04:06.352 --> 04:08.286
let's grab some coffee

04:08.387 --> 04:11.957
so we can chat about
your big TV debut.

04:19.265 --> 04:20.464
Hi.

04:20.565 --> 04:22.467
I didn't know what
the traditional gift was

04:22.568 --> 04:24.903
for accusing of
your boyfriend of murder,

04:25.004 --> 04:26.304
so I went with a plant.

04:26.405 --> 04:27.672
Don't kill it.

04:27.773 --> 04:29.207
Seriously?

04:29.308 --> 04:30.442
Oh, come on.

04:30.543 --> 04:32.144
We're gonna laugh
about this someday.

04:32.245 --> 04:33.645
Not today.

04:33.746 --> 04:38.150
Jesse... I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

04:38.251 --> 04:42.554
I...I just think I'm so used
to picking bad guys

04:42.655 --> 04:45.590
that I didn't trust
when I finally had a good one.

04:45.691 --> 04:50.328
- Look, I don't wanna be mad.
- Then don't be.

04:50.429 --> 04:52.430
But that doesn't mean I can just
pick up where we left off.

04:52.532 --> 04:56.034
You need time. I get it,
but... please, I just...

04:56.135 --> 04:58.737
I don't wanna lose you
from my life.

05:01.641 --> 05:03.175
Can I ask you a favor?

05:03.276 --> 05:05.143
Yes, anything.

05:05.244 --> 05:10.348
I still really need a job,
and I have this one lead.

05:10.449 --> 05:12.317
I was hoping you would
give me a reference.

05:12.418 --> 05:17.656
Of course! I'll give you
a killer recommendation.

05:17.757 --> 05:19.391
Not that <i> you're</i> a killer.

05:20.693 --> 05:22.994
I think I'm gonna go now.

05:24.297 --> 05:28.466
Yes, Genevieve, I'm taking
great care of Dr. Neff.

05:28.568 --> 05:32.537
Trust me, I will win him over
before you come home.

05:32.638 --> 05:36.374
Kiss the kids for me.

05:36.475 --> 05:39.511
Mrs. Delatour having fun
in New York with Remi and...

05:39.612 --> 05:41.279
Valentina.

05:41.380 --> 05:44.449
Does Dr. Neff like mayo
or mustard on his sandwich?

05:44.550 --> 05:46.084
Dijon mustard.

05:46.185 --> 05:48.505
He and I got off
to a rocky start.

05:48.521 --> 05:53.692
I am trying to impress him.
Got any tips for me?

05:53.793 --> 05:57.262
Well...
you could smile more.

05:57.363 --> 06:00.265
Smile more?

06:01.467 --> 06:04.869
I guess I could do that.

06:04.971 --> 06:07.252
You know, Dr. Neff is so happy
with Mrs. Delatour.

06:07.340 --> 06:09.874
I don't think I've seen him
love him anyone this much

06:09.976 --> 06:13.178
since... Lurlene passed.

06:13.279 --> 06:15.647
Lurlene?
Which wife was she?

06:15.748 --> 06:17.249
Lurlene was his mother.

06:17.350 --> 06:20.085
He loved her more than
anyone in the world.

06:20.186 --> 06:23.421
That... sounds healthy.

06:23.522 --> 06:26.258
Dr. Neff,
I made you lunch.

06:26.359 --> 06:30.028
Genevieve says turkey
is your favorite.

06:30.129 --> 06:33.098
Well, that's very considerate.
Actually, turkey <i> is</i> my favorite.

06:33.199 --> 06:36.034
Oh, well, then you'll really
like what I'm making for dinner.

06:41.741 --> 06:45.644
That looks positively
succulent.

06:45.745 --> 06:47.212
Wonderful effort, Zoila,

06:47.313 --> 06:51.783
but I don't want to spoil
my appetite.

06:54.654 --> 06:57.589
<i>Dios mio, señor.</i>

06:57.690 --> 06:59.424
I just mopped this floor
last week.

06:59.525 --> 07:01.893
What? You only mop in here
once a week?

07:01.994 --> 07:03.495
The point is,
that little boy of yours

07:03.596 --> 07:05.997
- makes a very big mess.
- He's not my little boy.

07:06.098 --> 07:08.867
He's just the crazy pet project
of my bored, deluded wi...

07:08.968 --> 07:10.535
Well, hello there, dear.

07:10.636 --> 07:12.937
Adrian, I have
some appointments tomorrow.

07:13.039 --> 07:15.440
I will be gone all day.
I need you to watch Deion.

07:15.541 --> 07:17.676
Oh, I'm sure Carmen
can babysit.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.314
This isn't about Carmen.

07:22.415 --> 07:25.250
This is about you
bonding with our child.

07:25.351 --> 07:27.352
As lovely as that sounds,
I'm extremely busy tomorrow.

07:27.453 --> 07:28.887
With what? Golf?

07:28.988 --> 07:30.388
And also a nap.

07:30.489 --> 07:32.624
Just take Deion along
to the club.

07:32.725 --> 07:34.292
He'll love the fresh air.

07:34.393 --> 07:37.429
Need I remind you,
I didn't want the b-o-y

07:37.530 --> 07:39.030
in the first place.

07:39.131 --> 07:40.265
I can spell, you know.

07:40.366 --> 07:41.966
This is not a negotiation.

07:42.068 --> 07:44.028
You're going to spend the day
with our little boy,

07:44.036 --> 07:47.794
and that's that.

07:50.899 --> 07:52.432
What's so funny?

07:52.534 --> 07:54.201
You're her bitch.

07:57.231 --> 08:00.825
Mr. Michael thinks Mrs. Taylor's
having an affair?

08:00.832 --> 08:01.965
Mm-hmm.

08:02.066 --> 08:04.334
I bet the affair's
with her trainer.

08:04.336 --> 08:06.103
- What?
- Every day, Mrs. Taylor says

08:06.204 --> 08:07.771
she's going to the gym,

08:07.872 --> 08:10.140
but I don't think
she's exercising.

08:10.241 --> 08:11.408
That's ridiculous.

08:11.509 --> 08:13.911
Taylor is not sleeping
with her trainer.

08:14.012 --> 08:16.380
Well, she's having an affair
with somebody.

08:16.481 --> 08:17.948
How would you even know that?

08:18.049 --> 08:19.750
Because she's the maid.

08:19.851 --> 08:21.418
If a spouse is cheating,
we're always the first to know.

08:21.519 --> 08:23.220
Not <i> always.</i>

08:23.321 --> 08:25.522
When Genevieve's fourth husband
was cheating on her, I knew.

08:25.623 --> 08:27.858
And when she was cheating
on him, I knew that, too.

08:27.959 --> 08:29.493
- They were both cheating?
- Nobody ever slept at home.

08:29.594 --> 08:33.030
I never had to make the bed.
That was a great marriage.

08:34.631 --> 08:36.366
If Mr. Michael said the affair's
been going on for months,

08:36.467 --> 08:39.269
then maybe Blanca knew
about it, too.

08:39.370 --> 08:41.871
Wait. At Zoila's wedding,
Blanca told me

08:41.972 --> 08:44.408
there was something going on
at that house.

08:44.509 --> 08:45.943
And you're just telling us now?

08:46.044 --> 08:48.345
What? I was mad.
She took my dress!

08:48.446 --> 08:51.982
And let's not forget,
it's still out there somewhere.

08:52.083 --> 08:54.518
Yes, Blanca's dead,
but that's the big mystery.

08:54.619 --> 08:55.986
#Where'sCarmen'sdress?

08:56.087 --> 08:58.489
Maybe Mrs. Taylor
was asking Blanca

08:58.590 --> 09:00.491
to keep her affair a secret.

09:00.592 --> 09:03.494
But Blanca had a big mouth,
so Taylor took her out.

09:03.595 --> 09:06.296
No, Taylor didn't do it.

09:06.397 --> 09:07.965
Whoever killed Louie
killed Blanca.

09:08.066 --> 09:09.466
And to chop up a body,

09:09.567 --> 09:11.268
the killer would have
to be strong.

09:11.369 --> 09:13.403
- Someone in really good shape.
- Like a trainer?

09:13.505 --> 09:16.840
I'm just saying.

09:16.941 --> 09:20.244
If Mrs. Taylor is
not the killer,

09:20.345 --> 09:22.946
then maybe her lover is.

09:27.218 --> 09:30.020
Hello. Oh, is Lorraine in?
I have an appointment.

09:30.121 --> 09:31.889
Oh, you must be Mrs. Powell.

09:31.890 --> 09:34.042
I'm Natalie,
your new case worker.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.799
Oh.
What happened to Lorraine?

09:36.800 --> 09:38.801
Lorraine's job is
to place children.

09:38.902 --> 09:41.671
My job is to determine
if that placement is working.

09:41.772 --> 09:44.607
Well, it is lovely to meet you.

09:44.708 --> 09:47.910
May I add, I simply adore
that blazer.

09:48.012 --> 09:49.379
Is it polyester?

09:49.480 --> 09:52.615
Lorraine may have fallen for that
kind of sweet talk, but not me.

09:52.716 --> 09:54.836
I need to conduct a home visit
and confirm

09:54.918 --> 09:57.186
Deion's living conditions
are satisfactory.

09:57.287 --> 10:00.256
Oh, his living conditions
are more than satisfactory.

10:00.357 --> 10:02.258
I don't like to use
the word "mansion,"

10:02.359 --> 10:03.960
but it's a mansion.

10:04.061 --> 10:06.763
Well, the size of your home
is irrelevant.

10:06.864 --> 10:09.732
You might feel differently
if you saw it by helicopter.

10:09.833 --> 10:11.734
Now I see there hasn't been
an interview

10:11.835 --> 10:13.236
with Mr. Powell yet.

10:13.337 --> 10:15.571
I believe Lorraine
handled that.

10:15.673 --> 10:17.940
So you can just check
that little box.

10:18.042 --> 10:19.308
I don't cut corners,

10:19.410 --> 10:21.811
not when the welfare
of a child is at stake.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.312
I'll be there
tomorrow at 3:00.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.114
Make sure your husband
is present.

10:25.215 --> 10:26.315
Of course.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.652
He'll be so excited.

10:33.223 --> 10:34.691
This is boring.

10:34.792 --> 10:36.292
Well, we should be
playing golf.

10:36.393 --> 10:39.028
But somebody took so long
finding his shoes this morning

10:39.129 --> 10:40.263
that I missed my tee time.

10:40.364 --> 10:41.831
I want chocolate milk.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.267
It's a country club.
They don't have that.

10:44.368 --> 10:47.036
Mom would get it for me.

10:47.137 --> 10:49.772
Her name is Evelyn.
<i>Evelyn.</i>

10:49.873 --> 10:51.641
It's a very simple combination
of the words

10:51.742 --> 10:53.743
"evil" and "villain."

10:53.844 --> 10:57.814
Mr. Powell, lovely to see you.
And who's your little guest?

10:57.915 --> 11:00.550
This is Deion, my...

11:00.651 --> 11:02.151
foster child.

11:02.252 --> 11:03.786
Oh, I-I know children
aren't allowed

11:03.887 --> 11:05.167
in the dining room, but...

11:05.255 --> 11:06.622
No, it's not a problem.

11:06.724 --> 11:07.990
I think what you're doing
is wonderful.

11:08.092 --> 11:09.258
And what am I doing, exactly?

11:09.359 --> 11:11.127
Well, becoming a foster parent.

11:11.228 --> 11:12.662
Last year, my husband and I

11:12.763 --> 11:14.597
adopted a baby girl
from Vietnam.

11:14.698 --> 11:16.299
How liberal of you.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.334
Well, I hope we'll be seeing
more of you

11:18.435 --> 11:20.002
and your beautiful family.

11:20.104 --> 11:22.872
Lunch is on the house today.
Well, thank you.

11:24.908 --> 11:26.743
Do you think it's possible
you could scare up

11:26.844 --> 11:28.077
some chocolate milk for Deion?

11:28.178 --> 11:29.579
Of course.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.780
And if there's anything else
I can do,

11:30.881 --> 11:32.048
please, just let me know.

11:32.149 --> 11:35.284
Oh, how about a tee time?

11:35.385 --> 11:37.920
Oh, I'll have them
squeeze you in.

11:40.457 --> 11:42.058
Well, that was unexpected.

11:42.159 --> 11:45.094
Not really.
White people love me.

11:45.195 --> 11:47.930
Oh! Is this your little boy?

11:48.031 --> 11:49.999
Oh, he's adorable!

11:50.100 --> 11:52.540
Yeah, I suppose
he gets that from me.

12:02.913 --> 12:05.915
Oh, my God, Olivia.
What are you doing here?

12:06.016 --> 12:08.284
I let myself in. You really
should lock your doors.

12:08.385 --> 12:10.253
There are a lot of nut jobs
out there.

12:10.354 --> 12:13.289
Yeah, I was just thinking
the same thing.

12:13.390 --> 12:14.957
How long has it been?

12:15.058 --> 12:16.292
A while!

12:16.393 --> 12:18.895
I was still working
for Michael and Taylor.

12:18.996 --> 12:20.930
You were stalking them.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.666
I'm afraid I was a bit
unstable back then.

12:23.767 --> 12:26.169
But I can assure you,
I am perfectly sane now.

12:26.270 --> 12:27.904
Yeah...

12:28.005 --> 12:29.305
Have you spoken to Taylor?
I heard about the breakup.

12:29.406 --> 12:30.773
So sad.

12:30.874 --> 12:32.708
You don't look sad.

12:32.810 --> 12:35.578
Anyway, I'm here because
I'm looking to hire a new maid.

12:35.679 --> 12:38.948
Sorry, I don't have anyone...
for you.

12:39.049 --> 12:41.250
Oh, no. I'm not looking to use
your little agency.

12:41.351 --> 12:42.885
I've actually found the maid.

12:42.986 --> 12:44.921
I just need a reference
for Jesse Morgan.

12:45.022 --> 12:47.657
Jesse wants to work for you?

12:47.758 --> 12:49.992
Well, I hated
my last cleaning lady,

12:50.093 --> 12:51.894
so I thought I'd try
a cleaning <i> man.</i>

12:51.995 --> 12:53.296
Is he any good?

12:53.397 --> 12:57.066
Uh... well, uh...

12:57.167 --> 12:59.035
<i>Oh,</i> dear. That bad, huh?

12:59.136 --> 13:02.905
No, no, Jesse's...
He's great.

13:03.006 --> 13:05.641
I'm just not sure that <i> you</i>
would be a good fit for him.

13:07.211 --> 13:09.771
Because I'm such
a perfectionist.

13:11.648 --> 13:13.849
Thank you for your candor,
Marisol.

13:15.853 --> 13:18.120
I miss this.

13:18.222 --> 13:20.690
We should do it again sometime.

13:20.791 --> 13:23.059
Definitely.

13:24.328 --> 13:25.895
What are you doing?

13:25.996 --> 13:28.064
I'm cleaning the chandelier.

13:28.165 --> 13:30.933
You took it down
from the ceiling?

13:31.034 --> 13:33.903
Well, don't worry.
I'll put it back.

13:34.004 --> 13:35.171
But I dusted it yesterday.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.706
You don't have to go
to all the trouble.

13:36.807 --> 13:37.907
Oh, I don't mind.

13:38.008 --> 13:39.408
I'm just giving it
a good scrubbing.

13:39.443 --> 13:42.345
I told you, I am trying
to impress Dr. Neff.

13:42.446 --> 13:45.781
But I can't do that if you
keep one-upping me.

13:46.437 --> 13:50.139
I don't believe in
doing things halfway so...

13:50.240 --> 13:52.760
But everything you're doing
goes against "Maid Code."

13:52.843 --> 13:54.677
- What's that?
- Maids have an understanding.

13:54.778 --> 13:57.138
We've got each other's backs.

13:57.181 --> 14:00.783
Sometimes you let me shine,
sometimes I let you shine...

14:00.884 --> 14:03.352
Okay, first, I don't think
"Maid Code" is a thing,

14:03.454 --> 14:04.587
and I intend to ask around.

14:04.688 --> 14:06.422
And second,
I refuse to do bad job

14:06.523 --> 14:08.224
just because you can't keep up.

14:08.325 --> 14:12.195
But you're supposed to be
helping me while I'm pregnant.

14:12.296 --> 14:14.376
Well, the truth is, if you
want to impress Dr. Neff,

14:14.398 --> 14:16.833
try being more...

14:16.934 --> 14:19.302
impressive.

14:19.403 --> 14:21.871
See? That's helping you.

14:21.972 --> 14:23.506
<i>Oh.</i>

14:23.607 --> 14:26.542
You wanna dance, <i>chica</i> ?

14:26.643 --> 14:29.212
Okay.

14:29.313 --> 14:30.713
Let's dance.

15:09.186 --> 15:11.654
Don't touch that.
It belongs to Dr. Neff.

15:11.755 --> 15:14.257
Well, the dust on it
belongs to Genevieve.

15:14.358 --> 15:16.459
It's very precious to him.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.361
I'll take care of it.

15:18.462 --> 15:22.098
I can clean a vase,
you lunatic!

15:22.199 --> 15:23.833
Aah!

15:23.934 --> 15:26.402
Uhh!

15:28.338 --> 15:31.107
What the hell was in there?

15:31.208 --> 15:33.543
Lurlene!

15:41.401 --> 15:44.016
Adrian, I'll be brief.

15:44.051 --> 15:47.040
Child services is paying us
a visit tomorrow,

15:47.075 --> 15:48.599
and they want to meet you.

15:48.654 --> 15:50.255
Fine,
I'll change my plans... again.

15:50.356 --> 15:51.823
Deion, what the...

15:51.924 --> 15:54.259
- Darling?
- <i>No! No, no, no, no!</i>

15:54.360 --> 15:55.460
I have to go.

15:55.561 --> 15:57.328
Ah...

15:57.429 --> 15:58.930
My horse lost?

15:59.031 --> 16:00.798
He was a favorite!

16:00.900 --> 16:03.340
I told you not to bet
on the favorite.

16:05.604 --> 16:08.273
Next time, I'll listen to you.

16:10.242 --> 16:12.377
Sorry I'm late.

16:14.079 --> 16:17.248
What's the matter?

16:17.349 --> 16:19.384
Adrian hates our foster son.

16:19.485 --> 16:22.020
Tomorrow, we have a home visit
from child services,

16:22.121 --> 16:24.561
and I am certain Adrian
will do something to ruin it.

16:24.623 --> 16:26.558
- Oh, dear.
- I just wish there was

16:26.659 --> 16:29.099
something I could do
to get that man to behave.

16:29.100 --> 16:31.099
- You should drug him.
- Beg pardon?

16:31.134 --> 16:33.364
Drug him, make sure
he's good and relaxed.

16:33.465 --> 16:35.466
You're crazy.

16:35.568 --> 16:37.888
I'm sorry.
That was insensitive.

16:37.970 --> 16:39.237
Oh, it's fine.

16:39.239 --> 16:42.106
Everyone knows I had some
mild anger issues

16:42.207 --> 16:44.008
after Michael divorced me.

16:44.109 --> 16:48.947
Then... I discovered
these sweet little babies.

16:49.048 --> 16:50.848
Now I'm happy as a clam.

16:50.950 --> 16:52.517
It won't help me if
he passes out at the table.

16:52.618 --> 16:54.252
Oh, no, no, no, no.

16:54.353 --> 16:57.188
In my experience, they just
put you in a state of bliss,

16:57.289 --> 16:59.223
even in the worst
of circumstances.

16:59.325 --> 17:00.646
Do you really think
it could work?

17:00.659 --> 17:03.461
Well...
I took one 10 minutes ago,

17:03.562 --> 17:06.830
and I'm finding <i> you</i>
utterly delightful.

17:10.336 --> 17:14.505
Dr. Neff is gonna be so upset.
What am I gonna do?

17:14.607 --> 17:17.175
First, you're gonna get up
and dust yourself off.

17:17.276 --> 17:19.844
Just try not to track Lurlene
all over the house.

17:19.944 --> 17:22.380
Don't make jokes.
This is serious.

17:22.481 --> 17:26.384
I'm covered
in Dr. Neff's mom!

17:26.484 --> 17:29.153
It's okay.
Accidents happen.

17:29.254 --> 17:32.090
Not to me!
He thinks I'm perfect.

17:32.191 --> 17:34.559
So you're not perfect.
He'll live.

17:34.660 --> 17:37.362
No, you don't understand.
I owe him.

17:37.463 --> 17:38.863
What do you mean?

17:38.964 --> 17:41.265
My dad took off
when I was little,

17:41.367 --> 17:43.067
and then my mom got sick.

17:43.168 --> 17:44.448
We couldn't afford a doctor,

17:44.536 --> 17:46.204
but Dr. Neff took care
of her anyway.

17:46.305 --> 17:49.941
And then after she...

17:50.042 --> 17:52.410
He gave me this job.

17:52.511 --> 17:56.147
He took care of me like a dad.

17:56.248 --> 17:58.349
So you don't want to
disappoint him.

17:58.450 --> 18:02.286
If he finds out about this,
I'll be devastated.

18:02.388 --> 18:03.588
Then...

18:05.290 --> 18:06.958
We won't let him find out.

18:13.499 --> 18:16.334
What are you doing?!
That's not Lurlene!

18:18.437 --> 18:19.717
It is now.

18:23.208 --> 18:25.877
I told you how important
that job was.

18:25.978 --> 18:27.211
Why did you tank me?

18:27.312 --> 18:30.114
I didn't tank you!
I said you were great.

18:30.215 --> 18:32.483
You told ms. Rice
I wasn't a good fit for her.

18:32.584 --> 18:34.919
No, I said <i> she</i> wasn't
a good fit for <i> you.</i>

18:35.020 --> 18:37.221
- Olivia is nuts!
- So?

18:37.322 --> 18:39.991
Look, working for Olivia
isn't your only option.

18:40.092 --> 18:42.927
I've already lined up
two job possibilities for you.

18:43.028 --> 18:45.396
She pays 40 bucks an hour.

18:45.497 --> 18:47.198
Whoa, she really is crazy.

18:47.299 --> 18:50.034
All you had to do
was say I was good.

18:50.135 --> 18:51.436
Look, I know you're mad,

18:51.537 --> 18:54.272
but you don't know
all of the things she's done.

18:54.373 --> 18:57.375
Do we really want that
kind of drama in our lives?

18:57.476 --> 19:00.478
In <i> our</i> lives?

19:00.579 --> 19:02.947
Marisol, do you think
we're getting back together?

19:03.048 --> 19:06.451
Well...

19:06.552 --> 19:08.152
Not right now, but someday.

19:08.253 --> 19:11.289
You just said you needed
more time.

19:11.390 --> 19:15.126
No,<i> you</i> said
I needed more time.

19:16.662 --> 19:19.397
Oh.

19:19.498 --> 19:21.332
I thought...

19:23.168 --> 19:27.105
I don't know what I thought.

19:30.409 --> 19:31.542
I-I'm sorry, I...

19:31.643 --> 19:33.578
No, no.

19:36.048 --> 19:37.648
It's my fault,
and... and don't worry.

19:37.750 --> 19:39.417
I'll... I'll talk
to Olivia again,

19:39.518 --> 19:42.420
and I'll get her to hire you.

19:42.521 --> 19:45.656
It's the least I can do.

19:45.758 --> 19:47.325
- Jacklyn bought our story?
- Yeah.

19:47.426 --> 19:49.193
So we're in the clean?

19:49.294 --> 19:52.363
Yes, but <i> mira,</i> we have to stop
seeing each other for a while.

19:52.464 --> 19:53.931
Why?
We got away with it.

19:54.032 --> 19:56.134
Because I'm this close
to getting what I want,

19:56.235 --> 19:57.602
and Jacklyn is the key.
I don't wanna screw it up.

19:57.703 --> 19:59.303
We just have to be
more careful.

19:59.404 --> 20:02.340
No, we cannot be together
until the album drops.

20:02.441 --> 20:05.610
So not more calling,
no stopping by, no more nothing.

20:05.711 --> 20:07.191
Mm-hmm.
Okay?

20:07.279 --> 20:08.846
Okay.

20:08.947 --> 20:10.615
Sebastien, what did I just say?

20:10.716 --> 20:13.516
You said that we're not gonna see
each other for a while.

20:13.519 --> 20:16.687
That means we're gonna have
to make this one count.

20:20.993 --> 20:25.029
Why are you so good at that?

20:25.130 --> 20:26.410
Because I'm French.

20:27.966 --> 20:29.433
Just this one last time.

20:29.535 --> 20:31.068
Yeah.

20:40.179 --> 20:43.881
When do you think
you'll be back from México?

20:43.982 --> 20:45.449
All right.

20:45.551 --> 20:49.420
Well, Ernesto, I have to go.
<i>Hasta luego, mi amor.</i>

20:49.521 --> 20:51.923
Hey, Rosie, I'm heading out.

20:52.024 --> 20:53.524
Going to the gym?

20:53.625 --> 20:56.227
Yep, I have my, uh,
bag right here.

20:56.328 --> 20:57.829
You look so nice.

20:57.930 --> 21:00.565
Your hair is all done.
You've got your makeup on.

21:00.666 --> 21:02.233
- So?
- Well, if I were you,

21:02.334 --> 21:05.369
I wouldn't want to get all
sweaty right now.

21:05.470 --> 21:08.272
Okay, uh, well, I'm, uh,
I'm leaving my phone on

21:08.373 --> 21:09.473
in case you need me.

21:09.575 --> 21:11.108
Don't worry, Mrs. Taylor.

21:11.210 --> 21:13.277
You go have fun
with your trainer.

21:17.683 --> 21:20.985
Put your shoes on,<i> papito.</i>
We're going for a ride.

21:31.096 --> 21:33.564
<i>Mami,</i> that was a stop sign.

21:33.665 --> 21:35.566
Play your game,<i> mijo.</i>

21:35.667 --> 21:38.236
- Where are we going?
- It's a secret.

21:38.337 --> 21:40.037
I have to pee.

21:40.138 --> 21:43.107
You're a big boy. Hold it.

21:56.955 --> 21:59.090
Why are we at the park?

21:59.191 --> 22:00.958
Don't you have to go
to the bathroom?

22:17.542 --> 22:20.444
<i>Ay.</i> Spence?

22:33.322 --> 22:35.089
I'll just be a moment, Natalie.

22:35.190 --> 22:36.824
Why don't you have a seat?

22:36.925 --> 22:38.259
Uh, where's Mr. Powell?

22:38.360 --> 22:40.027
Upstairs.

22:40.128 --> 22:43.965
He's, uh, so looking forward
to meeting you.

22:44.066 --> 22:46.434
Really?

22:46.535 --> 22:48.135
Oh, yes.

22:49.571 --> 22:52.473
He, uh, keeps going on and on
about it.

22:52.574 --> 22:55.810
Let me go fetch him.
Here I am.

22:55.911 --> 22:57.979
What's all this?
We're twins!

22:58.080 --> 22:59.447
Can you tell us apart?

23:03.318 --> 23:04.986
Adrian.

23:05.087 --> 23:06.854
This interview could alter
the course of Deion's life.

23:06.955 --> 23:09.857
I will not allow you to make
a mockery of it.

23:09.958 --> 23:13.194
Now come.
I've made you a drink.

23:16.365 --> 23:20.368
Oh, is this yours?
I'm sorry. I was parched.

23:23.505 --> 23:25.239
Rosie, what are you doing here?

23:25.340 --> 23:27.942
Are you having an affair with
Mrs. Taylor?

23:28.043 --> 23:30.111
No. Why would you ask that?

23:30.212 --> 23:34.081
I took Miguel to the park today,
and I saw you together.

23:34.182 --> 23:36.984
Oh. Well...
Taylor's just a friend.

23:37.085 --> 23:39.353
I rented her house, remember?

23:39.454 --> 23:41.494
If she's just your friend,
how come she slapped you?

23:41.523 --> 23:45.159
Honestly, uh, that's personal.

23:45.260 --> 23:46.427
Oh, my God.

23:46.528 --> 23:50.097
You <i> are</i> having an affair
with her.

23:50.198 --> 23:53.334
No, no,... it's it's not
like that. I swear.

23:53.435 --> 23:55.496
Were you with her
when we were together?

23:55.531 --> 23:56.337
Of course not.

23:56.438 --> 24:00.408
Did you start sleeping with her
when I was in the hospital?

24:00.509 --> 24:02.176
Stop it.
This is all in your head.

24:02.277 --> 24:05.946
Last time I was here,
you told me you still loved me.

24:06.048 --> 24:09.016
But you were screwing her
this whole time!

24:09.117 --> 24:11.519
I am not the one that walked out
on us. That was all you.

24:13.622 --> 24:15.122
Again?

24:16.324 --> 24:18.492
I can't even look at you.

24:21.096 --> 24:22.763
I'm so glad you wanted to meet.

24:22.864 --> 24:24.265
This is fun.

24:24.366 --> 24:26.400
So fun.

24:26.501 --> 24:29.317
Listen, I have to
tell you something.

24:29.533 --> 24:33.069
- Girlfriend to girlfriend.
- That sounds juicy.

24:33.170 --> 24:36.072
The other day
when I told you

24:36.173 --> 24:38.708
that Jesse wouldn't be
a good fit for you,

24:38.809 --> 24:40.243
I lied.

24:40.344 --> 24:41.911
Why would you do that?

24:43.547 --> 24:47.517
When Jesse worked for me,
our relationship became...

24:47.618 --> 24:49.052
romantic.

24:49.153 --> 24:50.954
It's over now.

24:51.055 --> 24:52.522
Not by my choice.

24:52.623 --> 24:54.324
Oh, dear, this is juicy.

24:54.425 --> 24:58.328
Anyway, Jesse is very attracted
to older women.

24:58.429 --> 25:00.530
Obviously, if he dated you.

25:00.631 --> 25:02.598
Uh-huh.

25:02.700 --> 25:07.236
Well, when I thought
of him at your house

25:07.338 --> 25:10.540
with you being so...
lovely and smart...

25:10.641 --> 25:13.409
Oh, my goodness.
You were jealous.

25:13.510 --> 25:14.711
I was.

25:14.812 --> 25:17.380
But Jesse really is
a wonderful maid.

25:17.481 --> 25:20.283
And you would be a fool
not to hire him.

25:20.384 --> 25:22.085
Say no more.
He's got the job.

25:22.186 --> 25:23.619
Ah. Terrific.

25:23.721 --> 25:26.489
And don't worry about Jesse
and me getting involved.

25:26.590 --> 25:28.024
I'm seeing someone.

25:28.125 --> 25:30.660
Oh!
Who's the lucky fellow?

25:30.761 --> 25:33.196
I suppose there's no reason
to keep it a secret

25:33.297 --> 25:34.998
now that they're separated.

25:35.099 --> 25:36.332
It's Michael!

25:36.433 --> 25:38.501
Michael?

25:38.602 --> 25:40.536
We've been seeing each other
for months.

25:40.637 --> 25:42.138
What about Taylor?

25:42.239 --> 25:43.639
Well, the whore's finally

25:43.741 --> 25:46.175
getting a taste
of her own medicine.

25:46.276 --> 25:48.945
Her husband left her,
she's a single mother,

25:49.046 --> 25:52.048
and that whole thing with
her maid getting murdered.

25:54.184 --> 25:55.685
Excuse me?

25:55.786 --> 25:58.154
Her whole life
is falling apart.

25:58.255 --> 26:01.124
I couldn't have planned it
better myself.

26:05.262 --> 26:08.931
Is Deion going to public school
or public school?

26:09.033 --> 26:13.403
We've secured him a spot
at Beverly Country Day.

26:13.504 --> 26:14.784
It's private.

26:14.905 --> 26:17.640
It's private?
That sounds so fancy.

26:17.741 --> 26:21.044
You're a couple
of fancy Nancies.

26:21.145 --> 26:22.645
That's a little rude.

26:22.746 --> 26:26.315
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is your name Nancy?

26:26.417 --> 26:30.253
Ha ha ha! Ha <i> ha!</i>

26:31.622 --> 26:35.558
Okay, now tell me
about Deion's diet.

26:35.659 --> 26:40.329
Mostly we feed him
glass and poison.

26:40.431 --> 26:43.366
Wonderful, wonderful.

26:43.467 --> 26:45.268
Natalie, will you give us
a moment?

26:45.369 --> 26:47.603
I will
if you will give me <i> this.</i>

26:51.575 --> 26:52.975
I think this woman's on drugs.

26:53.077 --> 26:54.377
What? That's absurd.

26:54.478 --> 26:56.913
♪ Oh, Deion boy ♪

26:57.014 --> 27:00.516
♪ The pipes, the pipes
are calling ♪

27:00.617 --> 27:02.452
Okay, I drugged her.
Why would you do that?

27:02.553 --> 27:04.454
It was an accident.
I was trying to drug you.

27:04.555 --> 27:06.055
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't want you to sabotage this.

27:06.156 --> 27:07.477
I thought you'd leap
at the chance

27:07.558 --> 27:09.225
to have Deion taken away.

27:09.326 --> 27:12.295
Look, I know I said I was
afraid of getting attached,

27:12.396 --> 27:14.997
but the truth is,
he's growing on me.

27:15.099 --> 27:16.699
You mean that?

27:16.800 --> 27:19.368
If you wanna make Deion
a part of the family,

27:19.470 --> 27:21.604
I'm willing to give it a try.

27:21.705 --> 27:25.942
Adrian, that makes me so happy
to hear you say that.

27:26.043 --> 27:29.045
Is it just me,
or is this floor amazing?

27:31.081 --> 27:34.383
She's going to be a problem.

27:34.485 --> 27:38.354
Hey, your segment's up next.
Why do you look nervous as hell?

27:38.455 --> 27:40.056
Because I'm nervous as hell.

27:40.157 --> 27:42.358
Oh, honey,
live tv can be nerve-racking.

27:42.459 --> 27:44.627
Pre-show jitters
are perfectly normal.

27:44.728 --> 27:46.662
It's more than that.
It's everything.

27:46.763 --> 27:48.464
It's being on TV and the album.

27:48.565 --> 27:51.100
It's all finally happening,
and I'm... I'm freaking out!

27:51.201 --> 27:53.302
Could you give us a minute?

27:53.403 --> 27:56.139
Now come on. Carmen,
you're always so confident.

27:56.240 --> 27:57.520
What's going on?

27:57.541 --> 28:00.977
I've been trying to be
a singer since forever.

28:01.078 --> 28:02.545
It's been my dream.

28:02.646 --> 28:05.348
But so many people along the way
said I wasn't good enough.

28:05.449 --> 28:08.084
And... What if
they were right?

28:08.185 --> 28:09.352
They're not.

28:09.453 --> 28:10.586
How do you know?

28:10.687 --> 28:12.255
Because <i> I</i> believe in you.

28:12.356 --> 28:14.190
And I'm the best
in the business.

28:14.291 --> 28:17.026
So if I say you're good,
you're good.

28:17.127 --> 28:18.261
Yeah.

28:18.362 --> 28:21.597
- Thank you, Jacklyn...
- Oh.

28:21.698 --> 28:23.332
For everything.

28:23.433 --> 28:26.435
Now get out there
and enjoy the moment.

28:26.537 --> 28:29.338
Trust me, you deserve this.

28:29.439 --> 28:31.474
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

28:31.575 --> 28:34.010
Welcome back to
"Hey, LA with Reese & Rick."

28:34.111 --> 28:35.611
And if you're just joining us,

28:35.712 --> 28:39.649
you missed Chef Kevin making
these amazing cake balls.

28:39.750 --> 28:42.351
They are actually amazeballs.
Can I say that? Is that dirty?

28:42.452 --> 28:44.987
Okay.

28:45.088 --> 28:48.291
Our next guest is a rising star
on the pop scene.

28:48.392 --> 28:52.428
Her album drops next week.
Here she is... Carmen Luna.

28:54.097 --> 28:55.264
- Whoo!
- Welcome, Carmen.

28:55.365 --> 28:56.666
You look fabulous.

28:56.767 --> 28:59.268
Thank you so much...
mwah... for having me here.

28:59.369 --> 29:01.637
Mwah.

29:01.738 --> 29:04.607
Yeah, so you are obviously
new to the music scene.

29:04.708 --> 29:06.409
Tell us about Carmen Luna.

29:06.510 --> 29:08.444
For example, are you single?

29:08.545 --> 29:10.545
- Oh!
- What? I can't even ask?

29:10.547 --> 29:12.515
Actually,
I am completely in love...

29:12.616 --> 29:14.116
with my album.

29:15.586 --> 29:17.420
Well, a little birdie told me

29:17.521 --> 29:20.175
that you are going to be
a big sensation.

29:20.176 --> 29:22.883
Ah, that was probably
my producer, Jacklyn Dussault.

29:22.918 --> 29:24.160
I just wanna give
a shout out to her

29:24.261 --> 29:26.262
and everyone who has ever
believed in me.

29:26.363 --> 29:27.763
Oh, that's so sweet.

29:27.864 --> 29:29.432
Well, why don't we get
a taste for your music?

29:29.533 --> 29:31.100
Let's watch
your new music video.

29:31.201 --> 29:34.036
Great! That video was
so much fun to shoot.

29:35.639 --> 29:39.275
<i>Dámelo, dámelo!</i> Ah!
<i>Sebastien!</i>

29:39.376 --> 29:41.043
Yowza.

29:41.144 --> 29:42.078
Oh, good.

29:42.113 --> 29:43.312
Wait, that... that...
Stop that, that's not it.

29:43.413 --> 29:45.773
That's not it. Stop that, please.
That's not it. Commercial.

29:45.782 --> 29:47.149
- Somebody stop that.
- Cut to commercial.

29:47.251 --> 29:49.385
Jacklyn!

30:00.450 --> 30:01.617
Hello, ladies.

30:01.718 --> 30:03.452
Hi, Dr. Neff.

30:03.553 --> 30:05.121
Oh, Zoila.

30:05.222 --> 30:08.557
How nice to see you
with a smile... for a change.

30:10.160 --> 30:14.697
Well, Mother has certainly been
polished to a lovely sheen.

30:14.798 --> 30:18.400
Nicely done, Joy.

30:19.669 --> 30:21.303
Wait a minute.

30:21.404 --> 30:23.372
Why is Mother so light?

30:23.473 --> 30:24.774
Light? Is she light?

30:24.875 --> 30:27.443
I don't see
how she could be light.

30:27.544 --> 30:32.314
What on God's green earth is
going on here, Joy?

30:32.415 --> 30:35.151
Uh, well...

30:35.252 --> 30:36.652
Uh...

30:36.753 --> 30:38.354
I dropped the urn.

30:40.457 --> 30:43.125
I accidentally spilled
your mother's ashes.

30:43.226 --> 30:45.361
- You <i> what?</i>
- I was dusting,

30:45.462 --> 30:49.098
and Joy told me not to touch it,
but I thought I knew better.

30:49.199 --> 30:53.602
For God's sake, Zoila,
this was my mother.

30:53.703 --> 30:55.070
It still is...

30:55.172 --> 30:56.505
mostly.

30:56.606 --> 30:59.208
You can rest assured,

30:59.309 --> 31:01.310
Genevieve is gonna hear
about this.

31:01.411 --> 31:02.878
I understand.

31:06.283 --> 31:08.250
You took the blame for me.

31:08.351 --> 31:12.855
Like I said, Maid Code.
We got each other's back.

31:17.894 --> 31:19.361
But just so you know,

31:19.462 --> 31:22.097
Spence and I are not having
an affair.

31:22.199 --> 31:25.267
Did he tell you to say that?

31:25.368 --> 31:27.469
No.

31:27.571 --> 31:30.706
It's the truth.

31:32.876 --> 31:38.047
We're in an addiction
support group together.

31:38.148 --> 31:43.719
Before you started working here,
I had an overdose.

31:43.820 --> 31:46.155
I was taking
some prescription pills.

31:46.256 --> 31:48.023
I thought that
that was an accident.

31:48.124 --> 31:50.226
It was, but it was also
a wake-up call.

31:50.327 --> 31:53.128
I realized that I'd become
dependent on those pills.

31:53.230 --> 31:57.700
I was using them as a crutch.
So I decided to get help.

31:57.801 --> 31:59.635
I started going to meetings.

31:59.736 --> 32:02.204
Uh, Spence was
in the same group.

32:02.305 --> 32:05.307
I already knew him, so I
asked him to be my sponsor.

32:05.408 --> 32:08.210
He's been helping me
get my life back together.

32:08.311 --> 32:10.412
So then how come
you slapped him?

32:10.513 --> 32:14.216
With you working here, he felt
it was getting too complicated.

32:14.317 --> 32:16.652
He told me he can't
sponsor me anymore.

32:16.753 --> 32:18.187
Oh, my gosh.

32:18.288 --> 32:20.089
I-I guess I just...
I snapped.

32:20.190 --> 32:21.457
Michael had just left me.

32:21.558 --> 32:24.093
It felt like spence was
abandoning me, too.

32:24.194 --> 32:26.161
I wish he would've
just told me.

32:26.263 --> 32:27.663
He couldn't.

32:27.764 --> 32:31.500
The support group is anonymous.
He was protecting me.

32:31.601 --> 32:34.470
He's a good guy, Rosie.

32:35.772 --> 32:37.673
You're lucky to have him
in your life.

32:46.616 --> 32:48.651
Go away.

32:51.688 --> 32:55.024
<i>Mon coeur,</i> I saw the show.

32:55.125 --> 32:56.525
I'm so, so sorry.

32:58.395 --> 33:00.529
My life is ruined.

33:00.630 --> 33:04.233
You think Jacklyn is going
to work with me now?

33:04.334 --> 33:06.068
I have nothing.

33:06.169 --> 33:07.569
You have me.

33:07.671 --> 33:10.031
Jacklyn wants a divorce.
We don't have to hide anymore.

33:10.106 --> 33:11.774
Maybe that's the silver lining.

33:11.875 --> 33:14.156
Sebastien, this relationship
was a mistake.

33:14.244 --> 33:15.477
How could you say that

33:15.578 --> 33:17.796
after everything we've done
to be together?

33:17.797 --> 33:19.197
What have we done?!

33:19.215 --> 33:22.618
We cheated on your wife.
We lied to her. We used her.

33:22.719 --> 33:24.486
We were horrible!

33:24.587 --> 33:26.588
You're upset.
You're not thinking clearly.

33:26.690 --> 33:29.625
I'm thinking clearly for
the first time in forever.

33:29.726 --> 33:31.794
I hate who I am
when I'm with you.

33:31.895 --> 33:35.164
<i>Mon coeur...</i>

33:35.265 --> 33:36.732
I need you.

33:36.833 --> 33:41.103
No, Sebastien.

33:41.204 --> 33:42.571
It's over.

34:03.426 --> 34:04.994
What happened?

34:05.095 --> 34:09.598
Well, we opened a lovely bottle
of Bordeaux.

34:09.699 --> 34:12.467
You had three glasses
and got a little tipsy.

34:12.569 --> 34:16.472
And we thought it best
if you slept it off.

34:16.572 --> 34:18.107
You don't remember?

34:18.208 --> 34:20.309
No.

34:20.409 --> 34:23.746
Because it never happened.
I don't drink!

34:25.782 --> 34:28.449
You people drugged me!

34:28.551 --> 34:29.717
That's ludicrous.

34:29.819 --> 34:31.520
Well, it'll be a cold day
in hell

34:31.621 --> 34:33.422
before I allow a child
to live here.

34:33.523 --> 34:35.123
What? Adrian!
Now just hold on.

34:35.225 --> 34:36.625
There must be something
we can do.

34:36.726 --> 34:38.527
Excuse me.
Yes, Deion.

34:38.628 --> 34:42.063
I took funny pictures of you.
Not now, sweetheart.

34:42.165 --> 34:44.733
No, no, look,
she was acting all weird.

34:49.406 --> 34:51.706
I think your boss would like
to see these pictures.

34:51.808 --> 34:54.143
Deion, give that to me.

34:54.244 --> 34:55.610
Not so fast.

34:55.712 --> 34:58.747
We'll keep them safe for you,

34:58.848 --> 35:04.119
provided Deion can remain
in our custody.

35:04.220 --> 35:08.323
Oh, my God! This little boy
is extorting me!

35:08.425 --> 35:09.625
I know.

35:09.726 --> 35:12.661
Turns out he's a Powell
after all.

35:16.171 --> 35:18.632
Taylor told you
about our support group?

35:21.023 --> 35:23.896
And I think you should
keep being her sponsor.

35:23.997 --> 35:25.664
She needs your help.

35:25.765 --> 35:29.501
Her marriage is over.
You can't leave her, too.

35:29.603 --> 35:31.670
You'd be okay with that?

35:31.771 --> 35:34.506
I'm sorry I got so angry.

35:34.608 --> 35:36.876
I guess thinking of you

35:36.977 --> 35:39.678
with another woman
still makes me crazy.

35:39.779 --> 35:43.949
Believe me, I understand.

35:45.719 --> 35:47.453
Which cheek did I slap?

35:47.554 --> 35:48.921
That one.

35:51.658 --> 35:52.938
Better?

35:54.895 --> 35:56.862
Well, Taylor slapped
the other one.

35:56.963 --> 35:59.365
That hurts, too.

36:13.446 --> 36:16.548
You're a great man,
Mr. Spence.

36:16.650 --> 36:19.285
You always do the right thing.

36:19.386 --> 36:21.620
Yeah.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.656
I hate that about me.

36:26.126 --> 36:29.495
Don't be a stranger, okay?

36:48.515 --> 36:51.517
Dr. Neff?

36:51.618 --> 36:54.853
Zoila feels really awful
about what happened.

36:56.890 --> 36:59.425
It's not just about the ashes.

36:59.526 --> 37:02.528
Ever since I moved in here,

37:02.629 --> 37:04.330
Zoila has been
trying to undermine

37:04.431 --> 37:05.864
my relationship with Genevieve.

37:05.966 --> 37:07.566
Oh, I don't know about that.

37:07.667 --> 37:08.934
Oh, I do.

37:09.035 --> 37:10.536
And sooner or later,

37:10.637 --> 37:13.439
Genevieve is going to have to
choose between us.

37:13.540 --> 37:16.575
And you are going to help her
make the right choice.

37:16.676 --> 37:18.043
I am?

37:18.144 --> 37:20.679
Yes.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.982
I'm counting on you, Joy.

37:26.920 --> 37:29.455
I'm sorry.
She ran right past me.

37:29.556 --> 37:32.825
It's okay, Thomas.

37:32.926 --> 37:35.394
I wanna hear
what she has to say.

37:37.664 --> 37:39.264
Well?

37:39.366 --> 37:41.767
I am so, so sorry.

37:41.868 --> 37:44.803
When I met Sebastien, I didn't
know how amazing you were.

37:47.507 --> 37:51.677
So it was okay to screw him
because you didn't know me?

37:51.778 --> 37:53.545
Look, I don't expect you
to forgive me,

37:53.646 --> 37:55.914
but I just wanted you to know
that I ended it with him.

37:56.016 --> 37:57.683
I don't...

37:57.784 --> 38:00.853
I don't care
about Sebastien anymore.

38:02.238 --> 38:04.594
But you wanna know
what hurts the most?

38:06.800 --> 38:09.041
I thought you and I
were friends.

38:09.076 --> 38:13.766
If it means anything, Jacklyn,
that part was real.

38:13.867 --> 38:16.735
It means nothing at all.

38:18.571 --> 38:20.806
Anyway...

38:20.907 --> 38:22.374
I completely understand

38:22.475 --> 38:24.576
why the label
would wanna drop me.

38:24.677 --> 38:26.545
Oh, we're not dropping you.

38:26.646 --> 38:29.615
What? You're still gonna
release my album?

38:29.716 --> 38:31.550
I didn't say that.

38:31.651 --> 38:33.485
I don't understand.

38:33.586 --> 38:36.989
We have you under
an exclusive contract.

38:37.090 --> 38:41.026
So your album is gonna sit
on a shelf and rot.

38:41.127 --> 38:43.362
<i>What?</i> You can't do that!

38:43.463 --> 38:44.897
Of course I can.

38:44.998 --> 38:48.934
You can't make music
anywhere else.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.969
I own you.

38:53.907 --> 38:56.375
So Mrs. Taylor
isn't having an affair.

38:56.476 --> 38:57.910
You were right.

38:58.011 --> 38:59.978
I've been thinking, and maybe
you were on to something.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.581
I spoke to Michael's ex,
Olivia,

39:02.682 --> 39:06.885
and she claims that she's been
seeing him behind Taylor's back.

39:06.986 --> 39:10.422
Maybe Blanca knew,
and that's why she was killed.

39:10.523 --> 39:11.890
Maybe.

39:11.991 --> 39:14.960
I can't imagine why Michael
would go back to Olivia.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.662
She's... certifiable.

39:16.763 --> 39:18.797
She could be making it up.

39:18.898 --> 39:21.600
- There's something else.
- Hmm?

39:21.701 --> 39:24.403
She said Blanca was murdered.

39:24.504 --> 39:27.439
But everyone thinks
Blanca killed herself.

39:27.540 --> 39:28.820
Except us.

39:28.875 --> 39:30.375
The killer knows the truth.

39:30.477 --> 39:33.512
You think Mr. Michael's ex-wife
murdered Blanca?

39:33.613 --> 39:36.281
If she did, she had help.
She couldn't do it alone.

39:36.382 --> 39:38.884
<i>Ay.</i> This is crazy.

39:38.985 --> 39:43.288
Yeah, well... so is Olivia.

39:43.389 --> 39:44.690
I just wanted to let you know

39:44.791 --> 39:46.558
that I'm sending you
the rest of your money.

39:46.659 --> 39:50.496
Everything's working out
just as I planned.

39:50.597 --> 39:53.398
No, no, you've done more than
enough for me.

39:53.500 --> 39:56.435
I'll take it from here.
