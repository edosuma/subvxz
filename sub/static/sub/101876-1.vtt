WEBVTT

00:13.790 --> 00:15.992
Great art
comes from suffering.

00:16.025 --> 00:20.595
That's true. We all lead
relatively safe lives.

00:20.629 --> 00:22.264
We're fighting wars overseas,

00:22.297 --> 00:25.001
but you'd never know it
from walking around Brooklyn.

00:25.034 --> 00:27.269
<i>Then there's
your emotional suffering,</i>

00:27.302 --> 00:31.708
but no one has got time
for your emotional suffering.

00:31.741 --> 00:33.843
They've got everybody
working so hard.

00:33.876 --> 00:36.846
People don't have time
to see their kids!

00:36.879 --> 00:39.581
You think they
have time for your art?

00:39.614 --> 00:41.583
No.

00:41.616 --> 00:44.319
Terrorism happens!

00:44.352 --> 00:48.323
Or some big bad thing happens
every few days in the news!

00:48.356 --> 00:49.658
And everybody's saying,

00:49.692 --> 00:53.863
"Why are you
wasting your time on art?

00:53.896 --> 00:56.465
There are more important
things happening in the world."

00:56.498 --> 01:01.738
But what artists do is
as important as anything else.

01:02.671 --> 01:05.474
Society's always
against the artists,

01:05.507 --> 01:07.810
because artists have
something to say

01:07.844 --> 01:11.681
'cause they
present uncomfortable truth!

01:11.714 --> 01:13.883
We're all looking
at the same world.

01:13.916 --> 01:17.053
An artist sees
how fucked up it is,

01:17.086 --> 01:21.758
and that maybe it
doesn't have to be that way.

01:22.759 --> 01:26.863
To have someone
looking at your art

01:26.896 --> 01:30.432
and have them
get that perspective,

01:30.465 --> 01:32.501
that can be profound.

01:32.534 --> 01:36.438
But you can't have
that perspective

01:36.471 --> 01:42.011
unless you unchain yourself from
everything society tells you!

01:42.044 --> 01:43.813
Start with this.

01:45.347 --> 01:48.017
Everything your mother
taught you was wrong.

01:51.954 --> 01:53.756
<i>Thank you, thank you,
Mr. Levkowitz.</i>

01:53.790 --> 01:55.590
Thank you very much.

02:01.998 --> 02:03.065
Fucking...

02:12.708 --> 02:14.543
Fucking shit!

02:14.576 --> 02:16.813
Ow! Fuck!

03:40.528 --> 03:42.664
- Yo.
- Hey, man.

03:42.698 --> 03:43.733
Hey.

03:43.766 --> 03:44.934
Hey.

03:44.967 --> 03:46.668
You know,
real life is bullshit.

03:46.702 --> 03:48.170
You spend all this time
in art school,

03:48.204 --> 03:50.806
and then people think
that you just paint for a hobby.

03:50.840 --> 03:51.974
Ugh, my God.

03:53.075 --> 03:53.943
- Just had a meeting with a gallery owner.
- Oh.

03:53.976 --> 03:56.012
Yeah. He told me
I wasn't dark enough.

03:56.045 --> 03:57.747
Did you tell him
to go fuck himself?

03:57.780 --> 04:00.683
No. He's friends with my dad.

04:04.552 --> 04:06.188
Yo.

04:06.222 --> 04:07.890
I'm so cold.

04:07.924 --> 04:09.557
My landlord turned off my heat.

04:09.591 --> 04:10.826
Can they do that?

04:10.860 --> 04:12.661
I'm not supposed
to be living there.

04:12.695 --> 04:14.897
And I didn't pay my rent, so
yeah, they can do that, I guess.

04:17.565 --> 04:18.868
Thanks, Kelsey.

04:18.901 --> 04:20.602
Yeah. Hey, you slept
with Chloe Brown, right?

04:20.635 --> 04:23.172
Yeah, like three years ago
in the pottery room at school.

04:23.205 --> 04:26.208
I mean, I get that she's hot
and everything, but she's just

04:26.242 --> 04:29.511
like this puddle of shallow
bullshit, and her art sucks.

04:29.544 --> 04:31.013
Her pussy
paintings were really cool.

04:31.047 --> 04:33.049
Oh, yeah, she's so cool

04:33.082 --> 04:35.217
that she could put pictures of her
trimmed cute little vagina out there

04:35.251 --> 04:36.218
and call that art.

04:36.252 --> 04:37.619
What's wrong with that?

04:37.652 --> 04:41.857
All I'm gonna say is that a vagina
by any other name is just a cunt.

04:52.768 --> 04:54.236
Where have you been?

04:54.270 --> 04:55.938
Stephanie, you didn't
tell me you were coming over.

04:55.972 --> 04:57.239
I don't have much time.

04:57.273 --> 04:59.742
I have to get
a train back to Greenwich.

05:23.799 --> 05:25.167
Move in with me.

05:26.969 --> 05:28.871
I'm married.

05:28.904 --> 05:30.773
I have a house.

05:32.274 --> 05:33.641
But you love me.

05:35.111 --> 05:38.214
I don't see why you can't just be
happy with things the way they are.

05:38.247 --> 05:42.885
Your mother says that even when you
get what you want, you are never happy.

05:45.888 --> 05:48.791
Yeah. She knows me so well.

05:48.824 --> 05:50.059
What do you
have to complain about?

05:50.092 --> 05:51.794
Your life is great.

05:51.827 --> 05:53.095
You're not poor.

05:53.129 --> 05:54.930
Your parents are nice.

05:54.964 --> 05:58.067
Those things seem
like advantages in life.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.902
They're not
helping me as an artist.

05:59.935 --> 06:02.171
Talk about
a white people problem.

06:02.204 --> 06:03.272
I'm white.

06:03.305 --> 06:05.307
All I have is white
people problems.

06:05.341 --> 06:07.943
What other kind of problems am I
supposed to have all the sudden?

06:07.977 --> 06:09.311
It's not my fault
I haven't suffered.

06:09.345 --> 06:12.848
You're always suffering
or sufferable.

06:12.882 --> 06:17.053
You know, you don't actually have to
lead a miserable life to be an artist.

06:17.086 --> 06:19.855
That's just
a romantic stereotype.

06:19.889 --> 06:21.690
What do you know?

06:21.724 --> 06:23.726
You live in the suburbs.

06:23.759 --> 06:25.928
Outside of pot and chardonnay,
you don't know anything about the world.

06:25.961 --> 06:28.998
Don't get down on me for wanting
to have a nice, comfortable life.

06:29.031 --> 06:31.100
I just think there's
more to life than that.

06:33.135 --> 06:37.572
You know, it's... it's pretty cute
that you care so much about this.

06:41.277 --> 06:45.081
But don't tell your mom that we're fucking
without a condom, okay? It's weird.

06:45.114 --> 06:49.018
It's weird because
you're married to somebody else.

06:49.051 --> 06:51.754
Okay. I have to go.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.756
Don't go.

06:53.789 --> 06:57.993
I have to pick up the dry cleaning
before I go home... To my husband.

06:59.695 --> 07:00.628
Love you.

07:30.960 --> 07:36.432
We had, uh, dinner with Stephanie
and her husband last week.

07:36.465 --> 07:40.402
You shouldn't
have let that one go.

07:40.436 --> 07:44.006
She broke up with me.
I wasn't happy about it.

07:44.039 --> 07:46.342
Well, her husband's
a charming guy.

07:46.375 --> 07:47.642
And he's loaded.

07:49.778 --> 07:51.881
He's an asshole.

07:51.914 --> 07:54.116
He's older than you. It's gross.

07:57.953 --> 08:01.957
Whatever happened with that meeting I
set you up with last week, Levkowitz?

08:04.793 --> 08:06.395
He didn't like my work.

08:06.428 --> 08:09.064
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I think it's really good.

08:09.098 --> 08:10.733
- I know you do.
- Hmm.

08:24.914 --> 08:25.981
Mom.

08:28.350 --> 08:29.785
Um,

08:31.287 --> 08:34.023
you know how you always say that
you want to support me as an artist?

08:36.125 --> 08:37.760
Anything I can do.

08:37.793 --> 08:42.198
I had this idea for a project,
and it involves you.

08:42.231 --> 08:48.003
Um, and I think it could be really,
really interesting and... and edgy and...

08:48.037 --> 08:49.205
and powerful.

08:50.105 --> 08:53.075
- How can I help?
- I want you to sit for me.

08:53.108 --> 08:55.811
I want to do a portrait of you.

08:55.844 --> 08:56.979
A nude.

09:00.349 --> 09:02.251
I don't think so, honey,
I mean I'm...

09:02.284 --> 09:05.955
I... I love you. I want
to be supportive, but, uh, no.

09:05.988 --> 09:08.090
This is... is... this is
the thing with you, right?

09:08.123 --> 09:12.895
You want to be supportive,
but when it comes down to it, you don't.

09:12.928 --> 09:14.496
That is not true.

09:14.530 --> 09:17.199
- Then come on, Mom.
- I'm not sitting naked in front of you.

09:17.233 --> 09:19.001
This is important, Mom.

09:19.034 --> 09:23.505
Th... not just for me. Like this
is important as a piece of art.

09:23.539 --> 09:25.107
Important how?

09:27.109 --> 09:29.511
It'll examine the mother and son
relationship from a whole new perspective.

09:29.545 --> 09:31.847
A perspective
with no barriers.

09:31.880 --> 09:34.350
A... and what aspects of our relationship
are you planning on exploring?

09:34.383 --> 09:36.151
There's
the psychological aspect.

09:36.185 --> 09:39.955
- Mm-hmm.
- Like how you fucked up my whole way of thinking.

09:39.989 --> 09:41.423
Is that what you think?

09:41.457 --> 09:42.258
For example.

09:43.192 --> 09:46.395
And then, yes,
there is the sexual aspect.

09:46.428 --> 09:48.530
Okay, stop.
That's just disgusting.

09:48.564 --> 09:50.165
I'm willing to go there

09:50.199 --> 09:52.201
if that's where I need
to go to be true to my art.

09:52.234 --> 09:56.972
Forget it. I am 47 years old.
I'm your mother. It... it's weird.

09:57.006 --> 09:58.440
I'm not doing it.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.576
I'm not going to sit naked
in a room in front of you

10:00.609 --> 10:03.846
so you could explore whatever weird
sexual fantasies you have about me.

10:03.879 --> 10:07.283
You don't like the idea of
sitting in a room with me naked,

10:07.316 --> 10:09.018
or you don't like
the idea at all?

10:09.051 --> 10:12.955
I can see how the idea is
interesting, but I'm sorry.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.556
I'm not that liberated.

10:16.191 --> 10:17.960
What if I did it from pictures?

10:17.993 --> 10:19.194
Like selfies?

10:19.228 --> 10:21.130
No, no. No, not selfies.

10:21.163 --> 10:23.032
I would have to get a friend to
come and take pictures of you,

10:23.065 --> 10:24.433
and then I would
paint it from those.

10:24.466 --> 10:26.869
It's not gonna be
as good, but it's a start.

10:26.902 --> 10:29.338
And maybe if you saw the potential
of what I'm trying to do,

10:29.371 --> 10:31.073
you would change your mind.

10:32.074 --> 10:34.343
Mom, this could be incredible.

10:56.231 --> 10:57.633
Hey, do you have 300 dollars
I could borrow?

10:57.666 --> 11:00.202
I know I owe you
some money already.

11:00.235 --> 11:03.205
How about this? I need someone to take
some pictures for a project I'm working on.

11:03.238 --> 11:04.406
Yeah? You'll pay me?

11:04.440 --> 11:06.475
- Three hundred bucks.
- Shit.

11:06.508 --> 11:08.243
I would do it for free
for you, you know,

11:08.277 --> 11:09.545
- if I didn't need the money.
- I know.

11:09.578 --> 11:12.081
All right, it's in Larchmont,

11:12.114 --> 11:14.083
you're gonna have to take a train from
Grand Central and a cab from the station.

11:14.116 --> 11:15.317
Who's the model?

11:17.119 --> 11:18.954
It's my mother.

11:18.987 --> 11:21.290
I want you to do some nudes for
a series of paintings I'm doing.

11:21.323 --> 11:23.592
Really, your mom? That's cool.

11:23.625 --> 11:26.161
- You think?
- Yeah. I mean, that could be really interesting.

11:26.195 --> 11:28.997
I'm trying to push myself into
some darker material. And I just...

11:29.031 --> 11:31.533
There's something not entirely
right about our relationship.

11:31.567 --> 11:34.002
What kind
of poses do you want?

11:34.036 --> 11:37.239
Standard dynamic poses. Maybe something
reclining. Get as many angles as you can.

11:38.273 --> 11:39.641
It means a lot
that you trust me with this.

11:39.675 --> 11:42.044
Yeah, man. I know
you'll get me what I need.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.113
I mean, with your mom.

11:44.146 --> 11:45.247
Yeah.

11:56.392 --> 11:57.493
Hey.

11:58.695 --> 11:59.962
Is that David Crays?

11:59.995 --> 12:02.264
Yeah, that's him. I've
seen him in here a few times.

12:02.297 --> 12:05.267
He's one
of my favorite painters.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.269
- Someone you don't hate?
- Shut up.

12:07.302 --> 12:10.639
- Have you ever spoken to him?
- No way. He's scary looking.

12:12.174 --> 12:13.675
I'm gonna buy him a drink.

12:22.418 --> 12:26.188
Hi. You're David Crays,
right, the painter?

12:28.457 --> 12:30.693
I took a class
on transgressive art in school,

12:30.727 --> 12:33.696
and I really flipped out
when I saw your paintings.

12:33.730 --> 12:37.599
I mean,
they seriously changed my life.

12:39.702 --> 12:40.602
Um.

12:42.070 --> 12:47.109
Okay, well, I don't want to keep you.
I just wanted to buy you a drink.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.544
Excuse me?

12:48.577 --> 12:51.013
Hi, could I get two
of whatever he's having, please?

12:51.046 --> 12:52.214
You got ID?

12:52.247 --> 12:53.649
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

12:53.683 --> 12:56.185
But I come in here all the time.
You know what? Whatever.

12:56.218 --> 12:57.419
Here you go.

13:04.626 --> 13:06.228
Sit down.

13:12.434 --> 13:17.473
<i>My name's Johnny. I'm 41.</i>

13:17.506 --> 13:21.210
- <i>So what's up, guys?</i>
- <i>Right. Your energy is hot through the whole...</i>

13:21.243 --> 13:22.344
Guys.

13:22.377 --> 13:26.281
This... this is David.

13:26.315 --> 13:28.317
I thought we'd be alone.

13:28.350 --> 13:32.521
Oh, no, no, no. These are... this is
Hannah and Christina. They're my roommates.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.057
Oh, it's right there.

13:36.726 --> 13:37.993
Ah!

13:40.395 --> 13:42.197
You cannot bring him in here.

13:42.231 --> 13:44.099
- Why not?
- He's a homeless person.

13:44.132 --> 13:46.201
He's not homeless.
He's a famous painter.

13:46.235 --> 13:48.437
- You're not going to have sex with him, are you?
- Oh my God...

13:48.470 --> 13:50.506
He's like 90.

13:50.539 --> 13:52.709
Okay, like it's better than that frat
boy you brought home the other week

13:52.742 --> 13:55.177
- that came all over the couch.
- Well, he was my age at least.

13:55.210 --> 13:59.081
- That was really disappointing.
- Okay, guys, just please be cool.

14:00.817 --> 14:04.086
I might have
bled a little in there.

14:12.294 --> 14:13.629
Ew.

14:15.698 --> 14:18.367
Come on. He's just kidding.

14:31.146 --> 14:32.614
You came, didn't you?

14:32.648 --> 14:35.852
Yeah, but what about you?

14:35.885 --> 14:37.586
I don't cum.

14:54.570 --> 14:57.439
- Hi. Quinn, right?
- Hi.

14:57.472 --> 14:58.708
Hi.

15:01.744 --> 15:04.146
Uh, Dan talks about you
all the time.

15:04.179 --> 15:08.617
- I can't believe we have never met before.
- We met at graduation.

15:08.650 --> 15:10.720
Oh, yeah. Right, of course.

15:10.753 --> 15:15.657
Uh, Dan is embarrassed by us, so, uh,
we hardly ever get to meet his friends.

15:15.692 --> 15:17.727
Well, he's just trying
to do things on his own.

15:17.760 --> 15:21.463
Yeah, which is why he wants
to do these paintings, right?

15:21.496 --> 15:23.866
Yeah, I think it's
a really great idea.

15:23.900 --> 15:26.535
Listen, I'm really
nervous, if you can't tell.

15:26.568 --> 15:28.838
It's okay. So am I.

15:28.871 --> 15:30.105
Okay.

15:31.506 --> 15:33.575
Good morning.

15:33.609 --> 15:35.444
Did you paint that?

15:35.477 --> 15:37.346
I like that very much.

15:37.379 --> 15:40.248
It reminds me of something I
might've done when I was younger.

15:40.282 --> 15:43.185
Yeah, it was, um,
it was an exercise for class.

15:43.218 --> 15:46.221
We were supposed to do a painting in
the style of a painter we love. Just...

15:46.254 --> 15:48.290
- So you chose me.
- Yeah.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.392
No wonder I like it.

15:50.425 --> 15:51.660
Can we get a drink now?

15:51.694 --> 15:54.496
Uh, it's still kind of early.

15:54.529 --> 15:56.665
It's almost 11.

15:56.699 --> 15:59.635
- Oh, shit. I got to go to... I got to go to work. I...
- You going to your studio?

15:59.668 --> 16:01.303
Yeah, I wish.
No, I work at a coffee house.

16:01.336 --> 16:04.606
But you can stay here
as long as you want.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.375
See you at the bar later?

16:06.408 --> 16:08.377
Yeah, if you want.

16:08.410 --> 16:09.712
I do.

16:09.746 --> 16:11.513
- Okay.
- Do you have any money?

16:11.546 --> 16:14.650
Uh, yeah,
I have a 20 in my room.

16:14.684 --> 16:16.385
I'll pay you back later.

16:16.418 --> 16:17.586
Okay.

16:20.990 --> 16:24.226
I love
this record collection.

16:24.259 --> 16:25.260
These all Dan's?

16:25.293 --> 16:29.799
No, uh, those are mine, mostly.

16:29.832 --> 16:31.801
Hardly ever listen
to them anymore.

16:51.586 --> 16:53.923
You're really beautiful.

16:53.956 --> 16:55.624
Stop.

16:55.657 --> 16:57.392
You're making me blush.

16:57.426 --> 16:59.762
You haven't even
taken your clothes off yet.

16:59.796 --> 17:06.468
It has been a while since I have been naked
in front of someone who's not my husband.

17:06.501 --> 17:08.370
It's not like he even notices.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.538
I'll notice.

17:10.639 --> 17:12.407
That doesn't help.

17:12.441 --> 17:13.508
I'm old.

17:15.044 --> 17:17.714
There was a woman in her 80s that
came into school to pose all the time.

17:17.747 --> 17:20.515
And younger
ones, too, I'm sure.

17:20.549 --> 17:22.217
They weren't all eye candy.

17:23.953 --> 17:25.220
So, um,

17:26.521 --> 17:29.391
what, do I just
take off my clothes?

17:30.459 --> 17:33.562
Normally, a model will get undressed
in private and put a robe on.

17:34.764 --> 17:37.900
But I think you should just start
taking your clothes off now.

17:42.905 --> 17:44.506
Okay.

17:47.043 --> 17:48.510
Like this?

17:53.983 --> 17:56.251
Slower.

18:08.497 --> 18:09.999
Now take off your bra.

18:11.801 --> 18:14.536
Okay, here goes.

18:21.376 --> 18:22.779
You look incredible.

18:24.379 --> 18:25.748
Lie down on the couch.

18:28.416 --> 18:29.584
Okay.

18:56.578 --> 18:57.914
Unbuckle your jeans.

19:12.094 --> 19:15.664
So, is that good?

19:18.600 --> 19:19.869
Very.

20:01.777 --> 20:04.747
I feel bad.

20:05.781 --> 20:07.382
I'm married.

20:09.051 --> 20:10.753
Oh, yeah.

20:16.092 --> 20:18.393
You never cheated
on your husband before?

20:19.729 --> 20:20.930
Once.

20:22.530 --> 20:25.533
It was an art dealer, actually.

20:27.203 --> 20:28.804
He was a fun guy.

20:32.008 --> 20:33.943
I feel bad about Dan.

20:35.745 --> 20:37.813
He was onto something good here.

20:37.847 --> 20:39.682
- Hmm.
- Trusted me.

20:42.218 --> 20:43.953
We can take them now.

20:44.887 --> 20:46.722
I wouldn't be so nervous.

20:48.124 --> 20:49.692
Okay.

20:49.725 --> 20:51.060
Hmm.

20:51.093 --> 20:53.229
Is your husband
coming back soon?

20:53.262 --> 20:54.730
No.

20:55.664 --> 20:57.066
He's at work.

21:05.908 --> 21:08.911
Can you get that?

21:20.256 --> 21:21.257
Dan.

21:21.290 --> 21:23.926
Hey, I got your pictures.

21:25.728 --> 21:27.263
Oh, great.

21:27.296 --> 21:29.966
I'll get your... I'll get your money.
I'll be right back.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.868
You're Quinn, right?

21:32.902 --> 21:34.636
I heard a lot about you.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.238
- Stephanie.
- Hmm.

21:36.272 --> 21:37.773
Cool.

21:39.141 --> 21:40.943
What pictures?

21:40.977 --> 21:43.079
Just something Dan
asked me to help him out on.

21:43.112 --> 21:45.982
Hmm, that's very secretive.

21:49.285 --> 21:52.121
Yep, it's all good.

21:52.154 --> 21:54.890
Thanks, man. Really helps out.

21:57.693 --> 21:58.728
Nice meeting you.

21:58.761 --> 22:00.262
You too.

22:04.934 --> 22:07.937
That's who you got
to take pictures of your mother?

22:08.838 --> 22:10.239
How do you know about that?

22:10.272 --> 22:13.843
She told me. No wonder
she got so weird about it.

22:13.876 --> 22:15.177
What are you talking about?

22:15.211 --> 22:19.682
When I asked her
about it, she turned red.

22:19.715 --> 22:21.751
Quinn is my best friend.

22:21.784 --> 22:25.653
Would you send Quinn
to take naked pictures of me?

22:25.688 --> 22:27.555
No, but that's different.

22:27.589 --> 22:30.226
Why?
Because I'm not your mother?

22:30.259 --> 22:32.228
'Cause, you know,
just 'cause she's your mother,

22:32.261 --> 22:35.331
doesn't mean that she's not
a hot MILF to someone else.

22:35.364 --> 22:38.701
She's a married woman, like...
The hell's wrong with you?

22:38.734 --> 22:42.705
You are just the most
innocent person sometimes.

22:42.738 --> 22:45.808
Are you really
ready to live in this world?

22:47.810 --> 22:49.678
- Let's see the photos.
- No!

22:49.712 --> 22:51.347
- Why not?
- Because I told her I wouldn't show anybody else.

22:51.380 --> 22:54.250
- She wouldn't care if I saw them.
- Maybe I would.

22:54.283 --> 22:56.786
Are you really gonna paint
something with those pictures,

22:56.819 --> 22:59.654
or did you just have them taken
for your own entertainment?

22:59.688 --> 23:01.791
So a minute ago,
I was too innocent,

23:01.824 --> 23:04.026
and now I'm the weird pervert who
jerks off to pictures of his mom?

23:04.060 --> 23:07.129
- Then why did you do it?
- 'Cause I thought it was a good idea.

23:07.163 --> 23:10.332
And it never occurred to you that
maybe no one else wants to live

23:10.366 --> 23:13.069
in your creepy mother
fantasy world with you?

23:13.102 --> 23:14.837
Apparently, you do.

23:15.871 --> 23:17.306
Fine.

23:17.339 --> 23:18.841
I'm leaving.

23:18.874 --> 23:20.976
But you
haven't heard the end of this.

23:24.980 --> 23:26.682
Yeah, I went to it.
And that was it.

23:26.715 --> 23:28.751
Yeah, it's the same...

23:28.784 --> 23:31.720
Same issue. Same concern. Hey.

23:31.754 --> 23:32.654
Hi.

23:35.424 --> 23:38.994
This drink is on me.
Here's the 20 I owe ya.

23:39.028 --> 23:40.763
Oh, thank you.

23:40.796 --> 23:42.264
Did you sell a painting?

23:42.298 --> 23:44.166
As a matter of fact, I did.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.136
Congratulations. I thought
you weren't painting anymore.

23:47.169 --> 23:49.171
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:49.205 --> 23:50.873
It's an old one.
Not one of my best,

23:50.906 --> 23:54.043
but it's nice to see my name
still has a little value.

23:54.076 --> 23:57.680
I can't believe it doesn't have more.
I mean, you have works in museums.

23:57.713 --> 24:02.017
Yes, my paintings still appreciate.
I don't get any of that money.

24:02.051 --> 24:04.253
So why don't you paint more?

24:05.254 --> 24:08.057
Back when I was someone
people interviewed,

24:08.090 --> 24:10.860
they would occasionally ask me
why I painted,

24:10.893 --> 24:14.296
as if I could ever answer
such a... an inane question.

24:14.330 --> 24:16.932
How the fuck do I
know why I painted?

24:16.966 --> 24:19.401
But I do know
why I stopped painting.

24:20.769 --> 24:21.904
Why?

24:24.940 --> 24:27.176
None of your fuckin' business.

24:33.849 --> 24:39.088
Shit.

25:31.240 --> 25:33.709
You stole my fucking painting!

25:35.811 --> 25:39.915
I sold it to Brett Wysinski
in Chelsea.

25:39.949 --> 25:41.250
Wait, for how much?

25:41.283 --> 25:43.319
Twenty thousand dollars.

25:45.120 --> 25:49.058
You sold my painting for 20,000?

25:49.091 --> 25:53.195
Sort of. I put my name on it.
I figured you stole it from me.

25:53.229 --> 25:54.797
I stole what from you?

25:54.830 --> 25:59.368
My ideas. You admitted
yourself that was your project.

25:59.401 --> 26:01.136
I want some of that money.

26:01.170 --> 26:03.973
I'm not giving you
any of that money.

26:04.006 --> 26:07.443
I sold that painting on my name,
not on the quality of the work.

26:07.476 --> 26:11.046
If it had been better,
it would've sold for more.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.215
You are a cynical bastard!

26:13.249 --> 26:16.752
- You know that?
- You don't even understand what I've done for you, do you?

26:18.254 --> 26:20.189
Have you ever sold
a painting for 20,000 dollars?

26:20.222 --> 26:21.357
Of course I haven't.

26:21.390 --> 26:23.959
You just did to Brett Wysinski.

26:23.993 --> 26:27.096
He's got a good reputation.
He could make or break an artist like you.

26:27.129 --> 26:32.001
If anybody finds out I duped
him, he'd look like a fool.

26:32.034 --> 26:33.902
Your work is good.
You proved it.

26:33.936 --> 26:37.072
I suggest paying him a visit
and showing him your work.

26:37.106 --> 26:41.043
If he won't help ya, you can take your
paintings to any other gallery in the city

26:41.076 --> 26:43.012
and tell them truthfully

26:43.045 --> 26:46.782
that your last painting sold for
20,000 dollars to Brett Wysinski.

26:51.553 --> 26:53.889
So you're saying I
should blackmail him?

26:53.922 --> 26:57.159
It's your foot in the door.
Push it open a little.

26:57.192 --> 26:59.595
You'll see anything
goes in this business.

26:59.628 --> 27:04.199
Just do me one courtesy.
Don't steal my ideas anymore.

28:00.956 --> 28:02.391
Who is it?

28:02.424 --> 28:03.459
It's me.

28:05.494 --> 28:06.895
What do you want?

28:06.929 --> 28:08.263
Open the door.

28:29.686 --> 28:31.220
What the fuck, man?

28:31.253 --> 28:32.689
What are we talking about?

28:32.722 --> 28:33.956
My mother,

28:35.457 --> 28:37.526
- who I trusted you with.
- What? I got the pictures like you wanted me to.

28:37.559 --> 28:39.361
Yeah, that's
not all you got, is it?

28:40.864 --> 28:43.298
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- You didn't delete the pictures,

28:43.332 --> 28:44.466
you fucking idiot!

28:45.601 --> 28:47.903
You just put 'em in the trash.
You need to delete them!

28:48.738 --> 28:51.173
I can't believe
you fucked my mother!

28:51.206 --> 28:52.608
Oh, yeah.

28:54.510 --> 28:56.245
It just kinda happened, okay?

28:56.278 --> 28:58.347
I didn't go out there with
the intention of doing that.

28:58.380 --> 28:59.648
She's my mother.

28:59.682 --> 29:02.451
I know! I know.
To you, she's your mother.

29:02.484 --> 29:06.121
But to me,
she's a very sensual person.

29:06.155 --> 29:07.256
Sensual?

29:07.289 --> 29:09.024
She's hot, okay?

29:09.057 --> 29:10.727
You may not see it, but she is.

29:10.760 --> 29:15.030
I see her as a person, not as,
you know, my mother like you do.

29:15.063 --> 29:16.465
Come on, man.

29:17.933 --> 29:20.169
Remember, we always said we wouldn't
let a chick come between us, right?

29:20.202 --> 29:21.336
Fuck you.

29:23.773 --> 29:25.174
What about my dad?

29:25.207 --> 29:26.709
I don't think we
should tell him, do you?

29:26.743 --> 29:28.076
What?

29:28.110 --> 29:30.245
Look, I really like her.

29:31.480 --> 29:34.717
I mean she's warm,
nice and protective.

29:36.485 --> 29:37.687
She really loves you.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.555
Oh my God.

29:39.588 --> 29:42.357
You wanted something dark,
didn't you?

29:42.391 --> 29:43.659
You wanted
to explore something dark

29:43.693 --> 29:46.195
about your relation
with your mother.

29:46.228 --> 29:48.731
- Maybe this is an opportunity for you to explore that.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

29:48.765 --> 29:52.067
No. Look, the normal person
would come in here

29:52.100 --> 29:54.336
and beat the shit out of me
for fucking his mother.

29:54.369 --> 29:56.205
But we're artists.

29:56.238 --> 29:59.208
We don't live by the normal
tenets of society.

29:59.241 --> 30:02.211
If we did, you wouldn't have sent
me up there to take those pictures.

30:02.244 --> 30:03.645
And I wouldn't have done
what I did.

30:05.347 --> 30:08.650
We can't edit our psyches just because
society says we should behave a certain way.

30:10.052 --> 30:11.620
You know that
better than anyone.

30:13.121 --> 30:15.123
Look at those pictures,

30:15.157 --> 30:17.526
and maybe you will find that something
in yourself that you were looking for.

30:22.531 --> 30:24.734
What would my dad say?

30:24.767 --> 30:28.070
If the paintings are great,
he'll support you.

30:29.137 --> 30:32.007
He doesn't have to know I was
involved. Nobody does.

30:33.776 --> 30:34.711
You're an asshole.

30:34.744 --> 30:37.546
- Come on, man. Let me buy you a drink.
- No.

30:38.447 --> 30:40.750
I... I got to walk
around or something.

31:04.239 --> 31:07.042
Okay.

31:37.372 --> 31:38.708
- Hi.
- Hey.

31:38.741 --> 31:41.209
- Hi. I'm here for Brett Wysinski.
- Yeah?

31:41.243 --> 31:43.846
- My name is Kelsey Fricke.
- Yeah, sure, one second, Kelsey.

31:43.880 --> 31:44.847
Thank you.

31:45.848 --> 31:48.584
Hey, yeah, Brett?
Um, Kelsey Fricke is here.

31:48.617 --> 31:51.353
Okay. Okay, cool.
He'll be right down.

31:51.386 --> 31:54.489
Hey, is...
is this a Marcel Jacob?

31:54.523 --> 31:56.258
Yeah.

31:56.291 --> 31:58.327
Yeah, yeah. It's actually...
it's an interesting painting.

31:58.360 --> 32:02.264
It's from the time when he was
becoming disillusioned with Dada.

32:02.297 --> 32:04.199
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

32:04.232 --> 32:06.234
Yeah, you can really see that.
It almost looks like constructivism.

32:06.268 --> 32:11.239
I know. He had such a distinct
voice no matter what style he used.

32:11.273 --> 32:12.474
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:12.507 --> 32:14.610
I always loved
the idea of Dadaism.

32:14.643 --> 32:16.511
Like I really wanted to love it,
but I don't know.

32:16.545 --> 32:18.881
I never fell in love
with it like I fell with futurism.

32:18.915 --> 32:21.249
Oh my God. I know
exactly what you mean.

32:21.283 --> 32:24.386
Futurism, it... oh my... It's
like... it's like all energy...

32:24.419 --> 32:25.654
- Yes!
- ...and, like, power.

32:25.688 --> 32:27.189
- Yeah.
- Do you know what?

32:27.222 --> 32:30.927
It kind of has this sexy
fascism thing going on.

32:30.960 --> 32:32.895
- Do you know what I mean? It's like...
- I do!

32:34.764 --> 32:37.834
Brett. This is Kelsey Fricke.
Remember?

32:37.867 --> 32:41.738
She... she has some
paperwork on the Crays painting?

32:42.805 --> 32:44.506
- Right, yeah.
- Yeah.

32:44.539 --> 32:46.174
- Come on back to my office.
- 'Kay.

32:46.208 --> 32:48.510
So, what is this paperwork
you have?

32:48.543 --> 32:53.548
I was actually wondering if you would take a
look at some of my paintings before we start.

32:53.582 --> 32:55.785
- You're an artist.
- Yes, as I said over the phone.

32:55.818 --> 33:00.555
I'm afraid I can't help you. I only take established
artists, mostly dead ones, to be honest.

33:00.589 --> 33:03.458
Yeah, but David said that you should
really take a look at my work.

33:03.492 --> 33:05.227
Do you have
paperwork or not?

33:05.260 --> 33:06.896
No, I do. But...

33:12.501 --> 33:14.436
So how much did
you get for his painting?

33:14.469 --> 33:16.171
Below six figures.

33:17.305 --> 33:19.207
He said he only got 20,000.

33:19.241 --> 33:20.710
Is that what he told you?

33:20.743 --> 33:22.779
- Yeah.
- It's not really my sort of thing.

33:22.812 --> 33:25.247
So this paperwork you have?

33:25.982 --> 33:27.249
Um...

33:29.384 --> 33:30.585
This...

33:32.554 --> 33:35.290
this is the painting
you sold, right?

33:35.323 --> 33:36.491
Yeah.

33:36.525 --> 33:39.327
Yeah, that's
from my Instagram page.

33:39.361 --> 33:40.562
From three years ago.

33:40.595 --> 33:41.798
When I painted it.

33:43.598 --> 33:45.702
Wait. What?

33:45.735 --> 33:48.971
And if you zoom in on the signature,
you'll see that I painted it,

33:49.005 --> 33:52.507
and he stole it from my apartment
and replaced my signature with his.

33:52.541 --> 33:54.242
And he got you to sell it.

33:55.343 --> 33:57.980
- This doesn't prove anything.
- But it's true.

33:58.014 --> 34:00.016
If Norman Chazelle
finds out, he's gonna be pissed.

34:00.049 --> 34:03.019
I mean, he's the one
that bought it, right?

34:03.052 --> 34:06.288
And isn't he like a really
important collector?

34:07.757 --> 34:10.492
- Are you blackmailing me?
- No.

34:10.525 --> 34:11.861
Then what do you want?

34:13.228 --> 34:15.031
- I just want you to look at my work.
- Which I've already done.

34:15.064 --> 34:17.700
No, what you've already
sold for a low six figures.

34:17.734 --> 34:20.335
For 25,000. I was lying.

34:20.368 --> 34:24.339
Look, I don't want your money.
I just want your help.

34:24.372 --> 34:26.008
My help?

34:26.042 --> 34:27.275
Selling my work.

34:28.510 --> 34:31.848
I could maybe
offer you an internship.

34:31.881 --> 34:33.983
You'd have to dress
a little more professionally,

34:34.016 --> 34:37.820
but it's a good start in the business,
answering phones, updating the website.

34:37.854 --> 34:39.956
- You know, there's a lot to learn.
- No. No way.

34:39.989 --> 34:41.824
- I'm not doing that.
- That's the best I can do.

34:41.858 --> 34:43.760
Okay, you know what,
I am blackmailing you.

34:43.793 --> 34:47.029
If you don't help me,
I will call Norman Chazelle and tell him

34:47.063 --> 34:48.898
that he just spent
25,000 dollars

34:48.931 --> 34:51.734
on an artist who just
graduated three years ago.

34:55.104 --> 34:56.605
Let me see that.

35:09.685 --> 35:10.853
Is this you?

35:12.054 --> 35:14.589
- What do you mean?
- Do you dress like this every day?

35:14.623 --> 35:16.525
Yeah.

35:16.558 --> 35:18.761
You know, there are whole sections
of the vintage clothing store

35:18.795 --> 35:20.595
where they have clothes

35:20.629 --> 35:23.766
that haven't been taken off the
bodies of dead Iraqi soldiers, right?

35:23.800 --> 35:25.400
I get it. You don't
like the way that I dress.

35:25.433 --> 35:27.502
You don't look like
someone who's making any money.

35:27.536 --> 35:29.806
Well, I'm not making any money.
That's why I'm here.

35:29.839 --> 35:32.074
- You're a creative person though, right?
- Yeah.

35:32.108 --> 35:35.077
And this is the best that you
came up with creatively?

35:38.580 --> 35:40.549
Yeah.

35:40.582 --> 35:41.751
I can buy new clothes.

35:42.885 --> 35:45.520
Julian Schnabel wears
a bathrobe to dinner parties.

35:45.554 --> 35:46.956
Yeah, but Schnabel sucks.

35:46.989 --> 35:50.960
Schnabel sells because people
want to be near him.

35:50.993 --> 35:53.830
Because
he's an interesting person.

35:53.863 --> 35:57.599
Because he wears
a bathrobe to dinner.

35:57.632 --> 36:03.371
Because being around Schnabel
makes you a better person.

36:04.606 --> 36:09.011
It doesn't matter that you think his
art sucks, because you don't matter.

36:11.613 --> 36:12.480
Okay.

36:14.750 --> 36:16.853
Wear something
that'll make an impression.

36:16.886 --> 36:22.591
And then we can talk about me helping you.
And unfuck your hair.

36:38.207 --> 36:40.675
Yo!

36:40.710 --> 36:42.477
Shit.

36:42.510 --> 36:45.715
You got a haircut.

36:48.184 --> 36:50.920
Are you done?
Great to see you.

36:50.953 --> 36:54.389
I'll see you in there.
Go have fun.

36:56.591 --> 36:58.127
Dan, the man!

36:59.195 --> 37:00.428
Come here, boy.

37:02.064 --> 37:04.767
Hey, Austin.
Thanks for inviting me.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.202
You're my blood.

37:06.235 --> 37:08.771
I need to hang out with you more
so I can stay grounded.

37:08.804 --> 37:10.940
You know, my life is
just insane these days.

37:10.973 --> 37:13.541
Austin, David Nicking
wants to say hi.

37:13.575 --> 37:17.780
I got to go. Have some drinks.
These are all sponsored and shit.

37:17.813 --> 37:19.215
Thanks
for bringing me to this.

37:19.248 --> 37:22.517
Yeah. I'm surprised
he didn't invite you himself.

37:22.550 --> 37:24.653
Why would he? He hates me.

37:24.687 --> 37:25.855
Why?

37:25.888 --> 37:27.056
Because he's a douchebag.

37:27.089 --> 37:29.658
Oh, look.
There's Chloe Brown.

37:29.692 --> 37:32.228
Let's go bask in the glow
of her awesome bullshit.

37:32.261 --> 37:35.197
It's strange because both
my parents are artists,

37:35.231 --> 37:37.666
so I grew up
in this artistic home.

37:37.700 --> 37:39.969
So my work doesn't seem
shocking to me.

37:40.002 --> 37:42.671
- My gosh.
- Why are you so obsessed with her?

37:42.705 --> 37:44.439
I'm not obsessed with her.

37:45.274 --> 37:47.642
Uh, don't ever say that.

37:47.676 --> 37:49.779
I'm gonna go
say hey to Austin.

37:49.812 --> 37:50.947
<i>Kelsey.</i>

37:50.980 --> 37:52.514
- Hey.
- It's so cool you came.

37:52.547 --> 37:55.051
Oh, thank you for inviting me.
This is awesome.

37:55.084 --> 37:56.686
Are you kidding me?
You're my blood.

37:56.719 --> 37:58.854
I need to hang out with you more
so I can stay grounded.

37:58.888 --> 38:01.489
Aw, this is all so
exciting, what's happening to you.

38:01.523 --> 38:05.227
Is that Quinn
that you brought here?

38:05.261 --> 38:06.362
Uh, yeah, why?

38:06.395 --> 38:08.563
He... he just makes me
a little nervous, that's all.

38:08.596 --> 38:10.565
I mean, when was the last
time the dude took a shower?

38:10.598 --> 38:13.169
I mean, I don't know. He's
been living in a studio, so...

38:13.202 --> 38:14.937
Jesus.

38:14.971 --> 38:19.108
This is where they find the... the new, young
talent, so I'll be back. Give me a second.

38:26.248 --> 38:27.950
Dan.

38:27.984 --> 38:30.518
So nice to see you.

38:30.552 --> 38:31.721
What are you doing here?

38:31.754 --> 38:34.790
Gregory is
looking to buy some art.

38:34.824 --> 38:35.992
You've met my husband.

38:36.025 --> 38:37.259
Gregory Buckland.

38:37.293 --> 38:38.094
Dan Pierson.

38:38.127 --> 38:40.029
I've told you about Dan.

38:40.062 --> 38:42.597
We went to high school
together. He's an artist.

38:42.630 --> 38:44.166
His parents came to our wedding.

38:44.200 --> 38:46.869
He did the painting
of the girl in the fire.

38:46.902 --> 38:48.804
Oh, the one
in the laundry room.

38:48.838 --> 38:50.638
It's in the laundry room?

38:50.672 --> 38:52.074
So what are you doing here?

38:52.108 --> 38:55.011
Austin's my friend.
We went to art school together.

38:55.044 --> 38:57.213
Oh, you're the gay one.

38:57.246 --> 38:58.981
- Right.
- What?

38:59.015 --> 39:01.050
Gregory, can I
steal you for a moment?

39:01.083 --> 39:03.085
- Sure. Excuse me a second.
- Sure.

39:08.057 --> 39:10.793
- You told him I was gay?
- Well, you were a little, right?

39:10.826 --> 39:12.762
What are you talking about?

39:12.795 --> 39:15.297
Remember, we did that threesome with
David Conway? You sucked his cock.

39:15.331 --> 39:16.799
I did not suck his cock!

39:16.832 --> 39:19.702
My chin might have touched it for
like a second. It was an accident.

39:19.735 --> 39:22.071
Well, you can see
how that would stay with me.

39:24.240 --> 39:25.074
Hey, Chelsea.

39:25.107 --> 39:26.976
Kelsey. It's Kelsey.

39:27.009 --> 39:29.745
- Sorry.
- I always thought it was Chelsea.

39:29.779 --> 39:33.215
Nope. And we've only known
each other for like five years.

39:33.249 --> 39:34.884
Can I give you some advice?

39:35.785 --> 39:37.686
You don't have to be
such a bitch all the time.

39:37.720 --> 39:40.823
Oh my God.
Chloe, thank you so much for that advice.

39:40.856 --> 39:44.026
But I have to be true to myself as
opposed to being someone I'm not

39:44.060 --> 39:45.861
because otherwise,
I would be pretentious.

39:45.895 --> 39:47.797
- You're calling me pretentious?
- No.

39:47.830 --> 39:51.267
I'm calling your vagina paintings
pretentious and derivative.

39:51.300 --> 39:54.070
- Of what?
- Of my vagina paintings.

39:54.103 --> 39:55.971
You can't be serious.

39:56.005 --> 39:58.673
- Okay, they are like exact rip offs.
- They look nothing like yours.

39:58.707 --> 40:01.710
The only difference is that
they're your vagina and not mine.

40:01.744 --> 40:04.880
I'm sorry that people are more
interested in my vagina paintings

40:04.914 --> 40:06.215
than your vagina paintings.

40:06.248 --> 40:08.150
Maybe you should've
groomed a little.

40:08.184 --> 40:11.353
Or wait, that was the point, wasn't it?

40:11.387 --> 40:13.689
Warts and all?

40:13.722 --> 40:14.957
They were honest.

40:14.990 --> 40:16.292
They were gross.

40:17.493 --> 40:18.928
Clearly, we have different
relationships with our vaginas.

40:18.961 --> 40:22.198
"Clearly, we have different
relationships with our vaginas."

40:22.231 --> 40:23.665
I just threw up in my vagina.

40:23.699 --> 40:25.134
Why don't you
paint a picture of it?

40:25.167 --> 40:27.169
I'm sure it'll do
as well as the others.

40:29.004 --> 40:31.639
You're Quinn Donahue,
aren't you?

40:31.673 --> 40:33.641
Yes. Do I know you?

40:33.675 --> 40:35.077
Claire Babchak.

40:35.111 --> 40:37.079
I work for Austin.

40:37.113 --> 40:39.348
Really? You
buy his paint for him?

40:39.381 --> 40:43.319
Actually, Austin sent me
over here to throw you out.

40:48.023 --> 40:49.391
Did he say why?

40:49.425 --> 40:50.960
No.

40:52.194 --> 40:57.099
I'll tell you what, I'll leave
peacefully if you come with me.

40:59.902 --> 41:01.137
I don't want to fight.

41:01.170 --> 41:04.874
Come with me for a drink
around the corner.

41:04.907 --> 41:07.710
I'm Austin's assistant.
I can't leave.

41:07.743 --> 41:08.944
A quick drink.

41:08.978 --> 41:10.913
He won't even
notice you're gone.

41:12.715 --> 41:14.183
And if I say no?

41:16.185 --> 41:18.254
I'm unpredictable.

41:18.287 --> 41:20.856
Ramon tells me that Austin
won't sell me a painting.

41:20.890 --> 41:22.791
- What?
- Really?

41:22.825 --> 41:25.828
He says it will devalue his art
'cause I'm not a respected collector.

41:25.861 --> 41:30.199
This kind of thing happens all the time.
It's purely an ego thing.

41:30.232 --> 41:32.434
Dan, you're his friend, right?

41:33.435 --> 41:34.470
Yeah.

41:34.503 --> 41:36.906
Maybe you could put
in a good word for Gregory.

41:36.939 --> 41:38.774
Yeah, that
would be very helpful.

41:38.807 --> 41:41.676
Look how interesting
you're turning out to be.

41:42.411 --> 41:43.179
Okay.

41:44.413 --> 41:48.184
Let me, um,
let me go talk to him.

41:48.217 --> 41:50.719
- Great.
- A great idea.

41:55.257 --> 41:57.826
Dude. I didn't
know you were gay.

41:57.860 --> 41:58.794
What?

41:58.827 --> 42:00.196
It all makes sense now.

42:01.397 --> 42:04.300
Listen to me. You know
that guy, Greg Buckland?

42:04.333 --> 42:05.301
No.

42:06.435 --> 42:08.137
The guy, he said that you
won't sell him a painting.

42:08.170 --> 42:09.939
- Ramon's guy, yeah.
- Okay.

42:09.972 --> 42:12.942
I think that is great.
Don't sell him anything. He's an asshole.

42:12.975 --> 42:14.510
Who do you
think buys art, Dan?

42:14.543 --> 42:17.479
As long as he has money,
who gives a shit if he's an asshole?

42:17.513 --> 42:19.415
They're just gonna put it
on the wall somewhere.

42:19.448 --> 42:23.352
Okay. Charge him a fuck load for it.
He'll pay it.

42:23.385 --> 42:25.187
<i>Everybody loves Austin.</i>

42:25.221 --> 42:27.056
Nobody likes him.
Are you kidding?

42:27.089 --> 42:28.257
You don't like his art?

42:29.491 --> 42:32.728
It's just like him, superficial,
loud, and kind of annoying.

42:33.562 --> 42:36.999
It's easy to toss insults at someone
when they're in the spotlight.

42:37.032 --> 42:38.834
Maybe if you were
more successful,

42:38.867 --> 42:40.970
you wouldn't be
so bitter about his success.

42:41.003 --> 42:44.073
I knew him before he was in the spotlight.
And he was always like that.

42:44.106 --> 42:46.175
Austin works really hard.

42:46.208 --> 42:47.843
A lot of the people
in art school,

42:47.876 --> 42:49.878
it was like they were
in law school or something.

42:49.912 --> 42:52.281
They were always talking about
business plans and career planning.

42:52.314 --> 42:54.450
Austin was
one of those people.

42:54.483 --> 42:57.219
Well, it's naive to think that you can do
this these days without playing the game.

42:57.253 --> 42:59.221
It's a business too, you know?

42:59.255 --> 43:01.523
I didn't go to art school
to study business.

43:01.557 --> 43:04.159
I went there to get as far away
from that shit as I could.

43:04.193 --> 43:06.528
Well, thanks
to our new friend, Daniel,

43:06.562 --> 43:08.497
looks like we have
ourselves a deal.

43:08.530 --> 43:10.532
A little more
than I'd like to have spent,

43:10.566 --> 43:13.302
but, um, believe me,
it was well worth it.

43:13.335 --> 43:16.805
Now, I suggest we go
back to my place

43:16.839 --> 43:19.208
for a little celebration
with some C&C.

43:19.241 --> 43:20.476
Definitely.

43:22.578 --> 43:24.146
Come on, Dan.

43:24.179 --> 43:25.881
What's C&C?

43:25.914 --> 43:27.383
Champagne and coke.

43:28.450 --> 43:30.552
- Uh-huh.
- No. I can't do that.

43:30.586 --> 43:32.321
Kissed a girl?

43:32.354 --> 43:34.556
- If I did that...
- ...pull the car around.

43:34.590 --> 43:36.191
Give us one second.

43:43.232 --> 43:45.834
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

43:45.868 --> 43:46.902
What?

43:46.935 --> 43:48.370
What about my mother?

43:48.404 --> 43:50.306
Why do you have to make
such a big deal about it?

43:50.339 --> 43:52.408
Your mom and I just need
each other right now.

43:52.441 --> 43:55.277
May need something,
but it's not you.

43:55.311 --> 43:57.179
You think I'm not good
enough for your mother?

43:57.212 --> 43:58.981
Yeah, something like that.

43:59.014 --> 44:00.616
Maybe you're not good enough for her.
Ever think of that?

44:00.649 --> 44:02.584
As far as mothers go,
she's pretty fucking awesome.

44:02.618 --> 44:06.955
It doesn't matter how awesome
she is! She's my mother!

44:06.989 --> 44:08.424
You can't have her.

44:10.092 --> 44:11.493
Where have you been?

44:11.527 --> 44:14.063
I was getting rid
of your friend.

44:14.096 --> 44:18.467
I sent you over there to throw
Quinn out, not go out with him.

44:18.500 --> 44:19.535
He's gone.

44:20.469 --> 44:23.138
Just stay away from him,
for your own good.

44:23.172 --> 44:25.274
He's a total disaster.

44:49.531 --> 44:50.499
Hi.

44:53.102 --> 44:55.304
I made you some soup.

44:55.337 --> 44:57.406
- You made soup?
- Yeah.

45:13.655 --> 45:15.290
This is so weird.

45:16.925 --> 45:18.260
You can't say you don't know what this
will do to your mom if you paint these.

45:18.293 --> 45:22.297
I can't censor myself just because
it might hurt her feelings.

45:22.331 --> 45:27.102
It's not censoring yourself.
It's called being a decent humanbeing.

45:27.136 --> 45:30.707
I'm not a decent
human being. I'm an artist.

45:30.740 --> 45:35.611
Give her a break. She's never
done anything but be good to you.

45:44.219 --> 45:46.054
That's her soup.

45:46.088 --> 45:48.090
She sent you.

45:48.123 --> 45:50.325
It's her recipe.

45:51.326 --> 45:53.328
Okay, she made it.

45:53.362 --> 45:56.465
She just thought
it would cheer you up.

45:57.466 --> 46:02.237
Do you remember when we were 15
and I posed for you?

46:02.271 --> 46:05.207
And I thought you
were so weird.

46:05.240 --> 46:09.511
I had never done anything
like posing naked before.

46:09.545 --> 46:13.282
I don't think that anyone
had ever even seen me naked.

46:13.315 --> 46:15.250
- I didn't think you'd do it.
- Hmm.

46:18.220 --> 46:20.122
And then your mom walked in.

46:20.155 --> 46:23.258
And she didn't get mad
or yell or anything.

46:23.292 --> 46:28.230
She just closed the door and said,
"Are you staying for dinner?"

46:31.801 --> 46:34.603
She just wants you
to be happy.

46:34.636 --> 46:35.604
Come on.

46:35.637 --> 46:37.439
I don't want to let her down.

47:05.367 --> 47:08.103
I really like this one.

47:08.136 --> 47:09.404
Want to buy it?

47:11.240 --> 47:14.343
Yeah, okay. How much?

47:14.376 --> 47:15.644
Four hundred bucks.

47:18.547 --> 47:21.751
I mean, that's
a discount. Obviously.

47:23.418 --> 47:28.524
Really? Really? Listen, will you
call John? Tell him I need him here, okay?

47:34.764 --> 47:38.267
Jesus Christ, you look like
you just got off the PATH train.

47:38.300 --> 47:40.269
God, you're such a snob.

47:40.302 --> 47:44.406
- I'm not even from Jersey. I'm from White Plains.
- Oh, God. Come on.

47:46.743 --> 47:48.277
Jesus Christ.

47:48.310 --> 47:50.279
It's okay. Sorry.

47:50.312 --> 47:52.281
That is Connor Fontaine,
all right?

47:52.314 --> 47:56.418
His father died a couple months ago,
left a huge collection to the man.

47:56.451 --> 47:58.287
He's like real cute.

47:58.320 --> 48:02.291
Hmm. He is one of the most
sought-after bachelors in New York.

48:02.324 --> 48:04.092
Come on. I'll introduce you.

48:04.126 --> 48:05.627
What? Really?

48:05.661 --> 48:07.396
Get a grip, all right?

48:07.429 --> 48:12.334
See if you can get through this
without embarrassing us both.

48:12.367 --> 48:16.338
Connor, there's someone I'd
like you to meet. Kelsey Fricke.

48:16.371 --> 48:17.740
Connor Fontaine.

48:17.774 --> 48:21.577
Kelsey's a,
uh, new artist, rising star.

48:21.610 --> 48:23.211
Nice to meet you.

48:23.245 --> 48:25.514
You showing somewhere?
Maybe I've seen your work?

48:25.547 --> 48:27.182
No, I... I doubt it.

48:27.215 --> 48:29.585
I'm taking her on, for myself.

48:29.618 --> 48:34.189
- That's not like you, Brett.
- No. It isn't.

48:34.222 --> 48:37.459
Well, either you've got
something on him or...

48:37.492 --> 48:39.094
or you're something special.

48:56.813 --> 48:59.147
- Kelsey, where do you live?
- Uh, in Bushwick.

48:59.181 --> 49:02.317
She's really
a rags to riches story.

49:02.351 --> 49:04.620
Yeah, my dad
worked in a mine.

49:04.653 --> 49:06.756
I guess you
could say he got shafted.

49:10.425 --> 49:12.127
Shut your drunken mouth.

49:13.528 --> 49:15.631
Kelsey doesn't need some rich,
little shit making fun of her family.

49:15.664 --> 49:17.165
You think it's
her fault she was poor?

49:17.199 --> 49:19.334
- Well, I didn't mean anything.
- No, it's okay.

49:19.368 --> 49:21.269
No, no, no, no,
no, it's not okay.

49:21.303 --> 49:25.775
Do you have any idea how hard it
is to be an artist in this world?

49:25.808 --> 49:28.243
Even with money,
it's fucking impossible.

49:28.276 --> 49:33.916
I think you must be really,
really talented to have made it this far.

49:33.950 --> 49:36.585
I have nothing
but respect for you.

49:36.618 --> 49:38.587
Thank you.

49:38.620 --> 49:40.188
I love this one.

49:41.724 --> 49:43.525
Has anyone seen these?

49:43.558 --> 49:44.694
Like who?

49:45.594 --> 49:48.263
People who might buy them.

49:48.296 --> 49:49.564
Not really.

49:50.666 --> 49:52.702
Do you have pictures
of these like on your site?

49:52.735 --> 49:54.236
I don't have a site.

49:54.269 --> 49:55.671
But I have pictures
of them I can send you.

49:55.705 --> 49:58.540
I know a buyer
who would love these.

49:58.573 --> 49:59.876
Anthony Burkhart.

50:01.243 --> 50:03.880
He loves taking new artists and
introducing them to the world.

50:03.913 --> 50:06.348
He's been trying to get Austin to
paint a mural in his apartment.

50:06.381 --> 50:11.219
I could convince him
that you should do it.

50:12.587 --> 50:14.222
How would you do that?

50:14.256 --> 50:16.425
I'd tell him
that you're talented.

50:16.458 --> 50:17.626
He listens to me.

50:19.729 --> 50:21.663
I'd love to do a mural.

50:23.265 --> 50:24.767
I'll see what I can do.

50:24.801 --> 50:26.268
I could be your agent.

50:27.302 --> 50:29.571
What about Austin?

50:29.604 --> 50:32.507
Austin's career
is doing just fine.

50:34.409 --> 50:40.315
Well, I really admire people who
know what they want out of life.

50:40.348 --> 50:44.553
- Right.
- Well, I'm 27, and I have no idea what I want to do.

50:44.586 --> 50:47.990
I mean, you like art, right? You never
thought about being an artist or...

50:48.024 --> 50:50.459
Oh, no, no. I'm not
a creative person. No.

50:50.492 --> 50:53.395
I get my demons out
on a couch, not on a canvas.

50:53.428 --> 50:57.200
Yeah, you don't really seem like the
type of person with problems at all.

50:58.034 --> 51:00.535
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

51:00.569 --> 51:01.771
Well, I do.

51:04.006 --> 51:04.907
Yeah.

51:05.708 --> 51:07.676
My... my dad was
always on top of me.

51:07.710 --> 51:09.244
He was a control freak.

51:11.681 --> 51:14.483
One day, I was 11 years old,
I was in my room.

51:14.516 --> 51:17.519
And, um, I was jerking off.

51:18.821 --> 51:20.957
And my dad came in,
and he caught me.

51:23.059 --> 51:25.928
So I stopped
with my hand frozen in place.

51:26.863 --> 51:33.770
And he... he came over to me with
that stern, stoic look on his face.

51:33.803 --> 51:35.905
And he grabbed my little cock,

51:37.106 --> 51:38.941
and he yanked on it.

51:38.975 --> 51:39.976
Hard.

51:41.944 --> 51:44.914
And he said, "Grab it
like you mean it, boy.

51:44.947 --> 51:48.785
Don't be such a fruitcake about
it, or you'll be here all day."

51:48.818 --> 51:50.753
He didn't say that.

51:53.421 --> 51:54.623
True story.

51:57.693 --> 51:59.796
I never told anybody
that before.

52:02.865 --> 52:05.634
Yeah, parents fuck you up,
that's for sure.

52:19.481 --> 52:23.085
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- No, I'm... I'm glad you came in. Come in. Lock the door.

52:23.119 --> 52:24.053
I'll just...

52:27.023 --> 52:31.426
Sorry, I... I don't normally do
all this. Uh, it's just, uh,

52:31.459 --> 52:33.495
it's been a tough time lately.

52:33.528 --> 52:35.998
No, no, I get it. I mean, I don't know
what I would do if my parents died.

52:36.032 --> 52:38.768
You're really easy to talk to,
you know?

52:38.801 --> 52:40.002
I love that.

52:41.838 --> 52:45.373
Kind of feels
like I've known you forever.

52:49.011 --> 52:51.814
- Like we're childhood friends, you know?
- Yeah.

53:13.668 --> 53:17.039
Hey, man. I thought you ghosted.
Oh, hey, check this out.

53:25.214 --> 53:28.150
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Um...

53:28.184 --> 53:29.986
Yeah, sure, Dad.

53:33.222 --> 53:36.025
- What's going on? I was hungry.
- This isn't working out.

53:36.058 --> 53:39.829
- What? Why? What did I do?
- You just sucked him off in the bathroom, didn't you?

53:41.130 --> 53:46.802
- Did he just tell you that?
- He didn't need to tell me it. You... you did though, right?

53:49.171 --> 53:50.907
So?

53:50.940 --> 53:54.476
I'm trying to introduce you to the world as a
serious artist not as a fucking cheap date.

53:54.509 --> 53:58.214
- It's not like I slept with him.
- That's not the point!

53:58.247 --> 54:00.816
Did you tell him how Ruskin
and Calvert influenced your art

54:00.850 --> 54:03.119
while you were
unzipping his pants?

54:03.152 --> 54:06.188
- No.
- Did you mention your admiration for Anna Blunden

54:06.222 --> 54:09.491
while you were
fondling his balls?

54:09.524 --> 54:11.060
No?

54:11.093 --> 54:14.096
Or even that you find futurism
sexy? Did you tell him that?

54:14.130 --> 54:15.664
It's...

54:17.133 --> 54:20.602
I see all of it in your work,
but I'm not hearing you talk about it.

54:20.635 --> 54:22.504
Because it wasn't
that kind of conversation.

54:22.537 --> 54:24.673
If you can't talk about your art
with Connor Fontaine,

54:24.707 --> 54:27.542
then who the fuck are you
gonna talk about it with?

54:27.575 --> 54:30.645
He was raised in a museum.
Jesus Christ.

54:30.680 --> 54:32.848
He had a De Kooning
in his bedroom growing up.

54:32.882 --> 54:35.151
Listen, he's going
through a lot right now.

54:35.184 --> 54:39.021
He's a fucked up rich kid
with a lump on his dick.

54:39.055 --> 54:40.990
Yeah. That's right.

54:41.023 --> 54:44.226
I sucked him off, too. At least I
knew what I was getting out of it.

54:44.260 --> 54:46.796
Okay, you know what?
You don't understand.

54:46.829 --> 54:48.864
Guys like that,

54:48.898 --> 54:50.232
they don't like girls like me.

54:52.034 --> 54:56.739
And I don't understand how someone as talented
as you are could have such low self-esteem.

54:59.041 --> 55:00.943
You got to get a fucking grip.

55:04.981 --> 55:08.583
Hey, we didn't know if you were coming back
or not, so we let them take your plate.

55:08.616 --> 55:09.885
It's okay.

55:09.919 --> 55:10.987
Is everything all right?

55:11.020 --> 55:13.856
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yes.

55:13.889 --> 55:16.859
Yeah, we're g... we're going to a
club after this. You want to come?

55:19.795 --> 55:24.499
I... No, I should probably go home.
I have work in the morning.

55:34.143 --> 55:35.745
- We got to go.
- Mm.

55:35.778 --> 55:37.880
- Hey, come on.
- Mm.

56:14.817 --> 56:16.152
It's a new painting.

56:16.185 --> 56:18.553
Actually, your friend Quinn,
painted that.

56:23.125 --> 56:24.326
He gave it to you?

56:24.360 --> 56:27.096
I bought it. I love it.

56:27.129 --> 56:29.065
You gave him money?

56:30.800 --> 56:35.004
You know, uh, I've got an old
friend at Bank of America.

56:35.037 --> 56:39.241
He said he'd take a look at your art
for a new building they're opening up.

56:39.275 --> 56:41.210
What... what... what
does that even mean?

56:41.243 --> 56:44.246
- How can you not understand that?
- I am talking to Dad.

56:46.849 --> 56:48.050
Dad, you were saying?

56:49.218 --> 56:51.821
My friend, Jeffrey Bush,
we were talking about our kids.

56:51.854 --> 56:55.357
I told him how you went to art school,
how you're trying to be an artist.

56:55.391 --> 56:57.393
He said he'd take a look
at your work.

56:57.426 --> 57:00.963
They... they don't want my paintings.
They want pictures of puppy dogs.

57:00.996 --> 57:02.398
I thought you
said you work isn't dark.

57:02.431 --> 57:04.666
I said my work
wasn't dark enough.

57:04.700 --> 57:07.403
Besides, I'm against everything
that Bank of America stands for.

57:07.436 --> 57:09.205
So it's okay to deposit
your checks there,

57:09.238 --> 57:11.207
but not okay to sell them
one of your paintings?

57:11.240 --> 57:13.409
You always have to hold
money over my head, don't you?

57:13.442 --> 57:16.378
- Well, if you don't like it, why don't you get a job?
- I have a job.

57:16.412 --> 57:17.746
I'm an artist.

57:17.780 --> 57:19.849
Just 'cause it doesn't pay me
money doesn't mean it's not a job.

57:19.882 --> 57:21.117
That's exactly what it means.

57:21.150 --> 57:23.219
What is going
on between you two?

57:26.155 --> 57:30.025
My whole life I've looked up
to you for moral guidance.

57:30.059 --> 57:32.161
Turns out, you're just
a bunch of hypocrites.

57:36.232 --> 57:38.834
- It... am I missing something here?
- I don't...

57:39.835 --> 57:44.073
You know, for an artist, you're pretty
judgmental, especially about infidelity.

57:44.106 --> 57:46.075
- I'm married.
- Yeah.

57:46.108 --> 57:48.676
I don't know what you're doing with
that fucking guy. He's a fucking joke.

57:48.711 --> 57:50.412
He's nice. He's handsome.

57:50.446 --> 57:53.749
- He's rich.
- Yeah, he's successful.

57:53.782 --> 57:57.353
He's 50 fucking years old. You don't think
I'll be successful by the time I'm 50?

57:57.386 --> 58:00.222
Okay, well, maybe I didn't want
to have to wait that long.

58:00.256 --> 58:02.158
And we've been
going out since the 10th grade,

58:02.191 --> 58:04.093
and you still haven't really
sold anything.

58:04.126 --> 58:05.728
That's not how it works.

58:05.761 --> 58:07.863
- That's how it worked for Austin Gamby.
- Yeah.

58:08.898 --> 58:12.001
Speaking of high school,
do you remember that girl Britney Conner?

58:12.034 --> 58:16.205
She used to tell people she was
related to Peggy from <i>Mad Men</i>.

58:17.907 --> 58:18.841
Yeah.

58:19.674 --> 58:21.977
We had English
together in 9th grade.

58:22.011 --> 58:23.479
We made out at the '90s dance.

58:23.512 --> 58:25.447
Okay. Well,
I'm not gonna ask about that

58:25.481 --> 58:28.250
because we were definitely
going out then.

58:28.284 --> 58:30.819
But apparently,
she's a total junkie now.

58:30.853 --> 58:32.421
She lives somewhere near here.

58:32.454 --> 58:35.891
She stole like 2,000 dollars'
worth of jewelry from her mom.

58:35.925 --> 58:37.193
Really?

58:38.327 --> 58:40.262
I always thought she was cool.

58:41.263 --> 58:43.199
Being a junkie isn't cool.

58:43.232 --> 58:46.101
That's just your silly idea
from watching <i>Trainspotting</i>.

58:46.135 --> 58:47.436
What do you know about it?

58:47.469 --> 58:49.004
Okay.

58:49.038 --> 58:52.508
Why don't you call Britney Conner and
see if she can help you be more dark?

58:52.541 --> 58:54.410
Maybe she'll
let you be a junkie with her.

58:54.443 --> 58:56.845
- Maybe I'll do that.
- Good.

58:56.879 --> 58:58.747
But just do me a favor.

58:58.781 --> 59:01.417
If you fuck her, wear a condom,
because I don't want to get AIDS.

59:05.988 --> 59:07.089
Hey.

59:10.793 --> 59:15.864
Remember that buyer I was
telling you about, Tony Burkhart?

59:15.898 --> 59:16.932
Yeah.

59:16.966 --> 59:19.368
Well, he loves your work.

59:19.401 --> 59:22.338
We have a meeting with Tony
and his wife, Lena,

59:22.371 --> 59:24.240
at their apartment on Thursday.

59:24.273 --> 59:26.208
Meeting for what?

59:26.242 --> 59:28.944
I told you, they want someone to
paint a mural for their apartment.

59:28.978 --> 59:30.112
And they want me?

59:30.145 --> 59:31.280
They want to meet with you.

59:32.314 --> 59:34.917
And they're not talking
to anyone else right now.

59:34.950 --> 59:36.018
Listen.

59:37.419 --> 59:41.457
The Burkharts are two of the most
influential buyers in the city.

59:41.490 --> 59:45.261
Everyone's going to want you
once you get this job.

1:00:09.218 --> 1:00:11.887
That's so awesome
that you're an artist.

1:00:11.920 --> 1:00:15.291
Yeah. Doing what you love.

1:00:15.324 --> 1:00:18.060
I'm still trying to sell
something, it's like...

1:00:19.328 --> 1:00:23.365
You go out into the world,
and nobody gives a shit.

1:00:23.399 --> 1:00:24.166
Right?

1:00:25.034 --> 1:00:26.969
Nobody gives a shit
about anyone.

1:00:27.002 --> 1:00:29.138
That... that's why I got married.

1:00:29.171 --> 1:00:32.207
Can you fucking believe it?

1:00:32.241 --> 1:00:36.078
We were so fucking high,
so we got married.

1:00:39.581 --> 1:00:44.520
It was in a church, too,
because Breck was a choirboy.

1:00:46.088 --> 1:00:49.158
He was raped
and abused as a child.

1:00:50.259 --> 1:00:52.494
But he's really
smart and talented.

1:00:52.528 --> 1:00:55.064
He's been looking for a job.

1:00:55.097 --> 1:00:59.935
But it's been tough.

1:00:59.968 --> 1:01:01.203
What does Breck do?

1:01:01.236 --> 1:01:03.505
I don't know.
But you know what, Dan?

1:01:03.539 --> 1:01:07.609
It's been really nice
to see you and all.

1:01:07.643 --> 1:01:10.012
But, you know,

1:01:10.045 --> 1:01:11.580
do you have any money?

1:01:12.948 --> 1:01:15.551
- That's what I, uh, I wanted to see you...
- Wait a minute.

1:01:16.652 --> 1:01:19.588
I remember you now. Dan.

1:01:21.390 --> 1:01:24.927
You're the preppy guy
I made out with at the dance.

1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:26.495
Yep. That was me.

1:01:26.528 --> 1:01:29.331
You tried to finger me,
and I wouldn't let you.

1:01:32.702 --> 1:01:33.969
No, I didn't.

1:01:34.002 --> 1:01:35.437
Are you sure?

1:01:37.005 --> 1:01:38.340
Yes.

1:01:40.175 --> 1:01:42.344
Well, it was somebody.

1:02:10.072 --> 1:02:11.173
Guys!

1:02:13.642 --> 1:02:16.912
This is Dan.

1:02:20.048 --> 1:02:23.285
He wants to buy us some drugs.

1:02:23.318 --> 1:02:24.586
You fucked him?

1:02:24.620 --> 1:02:26.355
N... no.

1:02:27.589 --> 1:02:32.928
I offered, but he
wants to do drugs with us.

1:02:35.631 --> 1:02:38.333
What type of drugs
do you think we do?

1:02:40.202 --> 1:02:43.105
I was thinking
maybe some heroin.

1:03:38.427 --> 1:03:43.365
Wait! Leslie!

1:03:44.500 --> 1:03:47.369
- Where you going?
- Home. This was a bad idea.

1:03:47.402 --> 1:03:49.371
Don't say that.
I'm glad you came.

1:03:49.404 --> 1:03:52.140
Oh, why? So I could see you with
your tongue down some girl's throat?

1:03:52.174 --> 1:03:56.078
My tongue? No. She...
she was just looking over some paintings.

1:03:56.111 --> 1:03:58.280
Oh, give me a break. I saw you.

1:03:59.248 --> 1:04:02.551
It's true. She gave me a kiss of
goodbye, but it wasn't like tongue.

1:04:02.584 --> 1:04:04.052
It might have looked
like tongue.

1:04:05.254 --> 1:04:07.489
- Do you have your contacts in?
- I don't wear contacts.

1:04:07.523 --> 1:04:11.159
- I've seen you with glasses.
- I wear reading glasses.

1:04:11.193 --> 1:04:12.762
What's in the box?

1:04:12.795 --> 1:04:14.229
Cookies.

1:04:14.263 --> 1:04:16.164
I made cookies for you.

1:04:16.198 --> 1:04:17.666
Now I feel really stupid.

1:04:17.700 --> 1:04:21.270
- What the fuck am I doing here?
- No.

1:04:21.303 --> 1:04:22.571
Don't feel stupid.

1:04:23.572 --> 1:04:26.475
I love cookies.
Don't be like that.

1:04:29.511 --> 1:04:31.313
You're so beautiful.

1:04:46.261 --> 1:04:47.362
Come on.

1:04:48.463 --> 1:04:49.799
Leslie.

1:04:51.400 --> 1:04:52.634
Aw.

1:04:55.705 --> 1:04:57.606
"Dare to dream."

1:04:57.639 --> 1:05:01.476
Yeah, except they
don't want you to dream.

1:05:02.678 --> 1:05:04.179
They want you to sleep

1:05:05.514 --> 1:05:09.518
because if you're asleep and
dreaming, you just can't do anything.

1:05:09.551 --> 1:05:14.623
So yeah, dare to live your life, dreaming
about the life that you could've had.

1:05:14.656 --> 1:05:18.728
But once you realize that all your
stupid little dreams aren't coming true,

1:05:18.761 --> 1:05:21.463
life is gonna suck for you.

1:05:21.496 --> 1:05:24.399
So, dare to do that.

1:05:25.902 --> 1:05:28.303
It's supposed
to be inspirational.

1:05:28.337 --> 1:05:31.306
Well, the kitten's never
gonna catch the piece of yarn.

1:05:31.340 --> 1:05:32.775
Hello?

1:05:38.480 --> 1:05:41.116
Hello, everyone.

1:05:44.854 --> 1:05:45.855
And you are?

1:05:46.956 --> 1:05:49.759
- Dan.
- Dan.

1:05:49.792 --> 1:05:52.762
You look like
a nice suburban white boy.

1:05:52.795 --> 1:05:54.663
Smells like Ivory soap in here.

1:05:54.697 --> 1:05:57.532
It's not something I'm used
to smelling at this address.

1:05:59.802 --> 1:06:04.673
Well, I find myself
in a desperate room.

1:06:07.209 --> 1:06:08.911
Dan.

1:06:08.945 --> 1:06:10.445
Tell me about yourself.

1:06:11.948 --> 1:06:13.181
I'm an artist.

1:06:13.215 --> 1:06:14.249
What medium?

1:06:14.282 --> 1:06:15.550
I'm a painter.

1:06:15.584 --> 1:06:18.755
A painter? That's
a noble profession.

1:06:20.522 --> 1:06:23.425
- You ever dipped in dab before?
- What is that?

1:06:23.458 --> 1:06:24.894
Yeah, I thought so.

1:06:29.531 --> 1:06:30.933
All right.

1:06:33.669 --> 1:06:35.537
I'm gonna set
you up with the pearl.

1:06:36.839 --> 1:06:39.508
But Dan can only do half
'cause this is good shit.

1:06:39.541 --> 1:06:41.410
And we don't want him dying.

1:06:41.443 --> 1:06:44.413
Okay? Good.

1:06:44.446 --> 1:06:46.181
That'll fix you up.

1:06:47.717 --> 1:06:49.551
But I'm gonna need 500 bucks.

1:06:49.584 --> 1:06:50.887
Is that okay with you, Dan?

1:06:50.920 --> 1:06:53.522
Because I assume
you're the one who's treating?

1:07:03.966 --> 1:07:04.734
Now, Dan,

1:07:06.635 --> 1:07:10.840
I would like you
to come over here

1:07:11.741 --> 1:07:13.508
and suck my cock.

1:07:15.945 --> 1:07:21.684
- What?
- I want you to get on your knees and suck it.

1:07:23.485 --> 1:07:24.754
I... I don't...

1:07:24.787 --> 1:07:26.288
It's not that big of a deal.

1:07:26.321 --> 1:07:27.857
All these other guys
have sucked my cock.

1:07:29.025 --> 1:07:31.728
The question is
how bad do you want it?

1:07:31.761 --> 1:07:33.462
I already know their answer.

1:07:33.495 --> 1:07:35.597
Come on, we've all done it.
Freddy's done it a bunch.

1:07:35.630 --> 1:07:37.800
Yeah, come on, Dan.
You could look at me while you do it.

1:07:37.834 --> 1:07:41.838
Come on. Suck him off. Let's get this
party started. I'm fuckin' dying.

1:07:42.805 --> 1:07:44.272
It's down to you, Dan.

1:07:47.509 --> 1:07:49.011
I'm gonna get out of here now.

1:07:49.045 --> 1:07:52.647
If you go and take this money,
then we don't have a deal.

1:07:52.682 --> 1:07:54.851
Dutch, that's not fair.

1:07:54.884 --> 1:07:57.619
Yeah, what the fuck, Dutch? I'll suck you off.
You can fuck me in the ass if you want.

1:07:57.652 --> 1:07:58.821
Yeah, fuck her in the ass.

1:07:59.989 --> 1:08:01.523
A deal's a deal.

1:08:02.992 --> 1:08:05.293
I'm sorry I let you guys down.

1:08:08.064 --> 1:08:09.264
You know what?

1:08:10.565 --> 1:08:13.035
I think I can keep the money.

1:08:13.069 --> 1:08:14.170
But I suggest you leave.

1:08:14.203 --> 1:08:17.807
This place is gonna get
very dark in the next few hours.

1:08:19.809 --> 1:08:22.310
I don't think it's something
you want to see.

1:08:57.814 --> 1:09:01.616
- I don't know why. I guess he likes you.
- But he asked me out.

1:09:01.650 --> 1:09:04.020
It's not a date, all right?

1:09:04.053 --> 1:09:08.390
This is what artists do.
They have dinner with potential buyers.

1:09:08.423 --> 1:09:09.324
Okay.

1:09:10.458 --> 1:09:11.727
Yeah, but what do I wear?

1:09:11.761 --> 1:09:13.796
Oh my God.

1:09:15.097 --> 1:09:17.532
I just had lunch
with Anthony Burkhart.

1:09:17.566 --> 1:09:21.570
He told me that you said that I wasn't
interested in doing the mural for him.

1:09:21.603 --> 1:09:23.105
Tony wanted someone new.

1:09:23.139 --> 1:09:25.107
I introduced you. You didn't
think this would get back to me?

1:09:25.141 --> 1:09:28.577
And Quinn, y... you're
gonna sell him Quinn?

1:09:28.610 --> 1:09:29.846
He's talented.

1:09:29.879 --> 1:09:31.681
He's talented
at fucking things up.

1:09:31.714 --> 1:09:34.449
He's talented
at fucking women.

1:09:34.482 --> 1:09:35.985
Apparently, he's fucked you.

1:09:38.520 --> 1:09:41.824
I think it might be better for the
both of us if I stop working here.

1:10:00.209 --> 1:10:02.879
So do you
know Herbert Draper?

1:10:02.912 --> 1:10:05.748
- Uh, British, Victorian, right?
- Yeah.

1:10:05.781 --> 1:10:09.886
I really loved his work, and all the
paintings that I've been doing recently

1:10:09.919 --> 1:10:11.754
are really influenced by him.

1:10:11.787 --> 1:10:14.422
Do you know Wilfrid Moser?

1:10:14.456 --> 1:10:18.127
- Uh, yeah, yeah. He's, uh, he's Swiss. Abstract.
- Yeah.

1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:21.030
Yeah, I saw a, uh,
retrospective of his in Barton.

1:10:21.063 --> 1:10:22.798
Is this a test?

1:10:22.832 --> 1:10:25.034
Can we not have
an art history quiz?

1:10:25.067 --> 1:10:28.771
I was just thinking that you... you've never
seen my work, so how do you know if it's good?

1:10:28.804 --> 1:10:30.072
Well, Brett says it's good.

1:10:30.106 --> 1:10:31.774
Yeah, but that's Brett's job.

1:10:31.807 --> 1:10:33.608
Well, Brett's good at his job.

1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:39.782
I want to talk about you.

1:10:41.117 --> 1:10:43.786
Yeah, it's not
my favorite subject.

1:10:43.819 --> 1:10:45.888
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:10:45.922 --> 1:10:48.858
Well, most artists love
to talk about themselves.

1:10:48.891 --> 1:10:50.960
Yeah, I know. I hate it.

1:10:53.696 --> 1:10:58.868
I was actually hoping you'd take me to
your studio and show me some of your work.

1:10:59.936 --> 1:11:03.906
My studio is my bedroom.

1:11:03.940 --> 1:11:05.041
Even better.

1:11:09.611 --> 1:11:11.814
- Brett said that...
- Oh, will you forget about Brett?

1:11:11.847 --> 1:11:15.051
- Uh, yeah. I'm... I'm trying to.
- Okay.

1:11:18.888 --> 1:11:21.090
No, no, no, no, I'll put this
on the company.

1:11:21.123 --> 1:11:25.493
I mean,
we're talking business, right?

1:11:26.963 --> 1:11:28.530
Are we though?

1:11:33.269 --> 1:11:34.870
Welcome.

1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:40.542
Ugh.

1:11:40.575 --> 1:11:42.577
Done.

1:11:42.610 --> 1:11:43.846
'Kay.

1:11:43.879 --> 1:11:45.982
Hold on,
I need to take it. Hello?

1:11:46.015 --> 1:11:48.550
Hey, I've been
texting you. How'd it go?

1:11:48.583 --> 1:11:50.953
It actually... it went
really well.

1:11:50.987 --> 1:11:54.589
He's, um, he's actually...
he's actually here.

1:11:54.622 --> 1:11:55.858
He's what?

1:11:55.891 --> 1:11:57.592
Yeah, he came
by to see the studio.

1:11:57.625 --> 1:11:58.861
Right.

1:11:58.894 --> 1:12:02.098
- Which is your bedroom.
- Yeah, but, um...

1:12:02.131 --> 1:12:04.767
it's... it's... it's not like I
was gonna do anything.

1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:06.668
Then what the fuck
is he doing there?

1:12:06.702 --> 1:12:08.838
<i>Listen to me,
all right, it's really simple.</i>

1:12:08.871 --> 1:12:12.208
You want to sell him something?
You want to date him? You can't do both.

1:12:16.045 --> 1:12:17.680
I'm... I want
to sell him something.

1:12:17.713 --> 1:12:22.018
Good. 'Cause he's fucking awful
at dating. All right?

1:12:22.051 --> 1:12:24.153
But he's
really good at buying paintings.

1:12:24.186 --> 1:12:25.221
I got it.

1:12:31.193 --> 1:12:32.128
What's up?

1:12:33.229 --> 1:12:37.133
Well, I think... I think
I'm just gonna walk you out.

1:12:38.633 --> 1:12:39.802
Seriously?

1:12:39.835 --> 1:12:41.003
Yeah.

1:12:41.037 --> 1:12:42.805
You'll call me tomorrow?

1:12:43.773 --> 1:12:47.009
Yeah, I'll, uh, I'll call Brett.

1:12:54.216 --> 1:12:59.021
I just have to come to terms
that I'm not good at this.

1:12:59.055 --> 1:13:02.858
I mean, even if my art is good,
which I still don't know if it is,

1:13:02.892 --> 1:13:04.794
I am so bad
at all this other shit,

1:13:04.827 --> 1:13:08.164
like all of the schmoozing and the
pretending that I have this ego

1:13:08.197 --> 1:13:10.066
and figuring out
what to put on my Instagram.

1:13:10.099 --> 1:13:11.633
That stuff isn't important.

1:13:11.666 --> 1:13:13.302
Yes, it is.

1:13:13.335 --> 1:13:15.704
And I... I don't know
what to do

1:13:15.738 --> 1:13:21.110
because I cannot keep working these
shitty jobs for the rest of my life.

1:13:27.216 --> 1:13:29.952
Okay, what is
going on with you two?

1:13:30.953 --> 1:13:32.822
I don't know
what his problem is.

1:13:32.855 --> 1:13:36.292
- You have to go talk to him. This is crazy.
- He won't talk to me.

1:13:38.861 --> 1:13:40.196
All right,
I'm doing it for you.

1:13:45.901 --> 1:13:47.069
Yo.

1:13:48.437 --> 1:13:50.840
Quinn says he's sorry.

1:13:50.873 --> 1:13:53.976
Fuck him. I'm sick of him.

1:13:54.009 --> 1:13:55.677
Come on. He's
your best friend.

1:13:55.711 --> 1:14:01.050
He's the worst friend ever.
He is totally unreliable.

1:14:10.893 --> 1:14:12.228
What happened?

1:14:13.661 --> 1:14:16.065
He said that you're not a good
friend because you're not reliable.

1:14:16.098 --> 1:14:19.935
You don't pick your friends
because they're reliable, do you?

1:14:19.969 --> 1:14:21.270
What are we, accountants?

1:14:22.938 --> 1:14:26.709
He said we don't pick our friends because
they're reliable. We're not accountants.

1:14:29.011 --> 1:14:34.083
He's just using this whole bohemian act as
an excuse to be a total fucking asshole.

1:14:34.116 --> 1:14:35.918
Like he always does.

1:14:35.951 --> 1:14:38.287
He's not buying that.

1:14:38.320 --> 1:14:40.389
Tell him that he's living
in the past.

1:14:40.422 --> 1:14:42.291
He still has
his high school girlfriend,

1:14:42.324 --> 1:14:44.293
and he'll never move on in life
until he breaks up with her

1:14:44.326 --> 1:14:46.862
and stops taking money
from his parents.

1:14:46.896 --> 1:14:48.898
Oh, he's not gonna like that.

1:14:48.931 --> 1:14:51.133
He needs to hear it.

1:14:51.167 --> 1:14:53.435
He said you need to break up with your girlfriend
'cause he's... she's bringing you down.

1:14:55.504 --> 1:15:00.776
You tell him just because he's
fucking my mother

1:15:00.809 --> 1:15:04.079
doesn't mean
he knows anything about my life.

1:15:06.348 --> 1:15:09.251
He said something
about you fucking his mother?

1:15:09.285 --> 1:15:10.786
Tell him we broke up.

1:15:10.819 --> 1:15:13.923
- You broke up with his mother?
- Just tell him.

1:15:13.956 --> 1:15:15.691
He said that they broke up.

1:15:17.960 --> 1:15:19.495
Yeah?

1:15:19.528 --> 1:15:20.763
Yeah.

1:15:22.097 --> 1:15:24.266
He said he couldn't let it get
in the way of your friendship.

1:15:26.869 --> 1:15:28.370
He said that?

1:15:28.404 --> 1:15:29.705
His words.

1:15:33.409 --> 1:15:36.245
Fuck it. I'm over it anyway.

1:15:37.179 --> 1:15:39.081
I'm done
with the whole mother thing.

1:15:39.114 --> 1:15:41.517
It was dumb, the whole idea.

1:15:41.550 --> 1:15:42.952
What happened?

1:15:42.985 --> 1:15:44.486
I just can't
deal with it anymore.

1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:47.790
You always do this. You get
so close, and then you give up.

1:15:47.823 --> 1:15:49.925
Like you're scared of actually
doing something great.

1:15:49.959 --> 1:15:52.127
Your mom thinks it's
because you never worked.

1:15:52.161 --> 1:15:53.329
You never worked.

1:15:53.362 --> 1:15:55.898
I didn't say I agreed with her.

1:15:55.931 --> 1:16:00.202
I'm just saying that those paintings
were a great idea. And I know you.

1:16:01.270 --> 1:16:03.806
I know you even better
now that I dated your mom.

1:16:04.573 --> 1:16:07.509
You have to finish
those paintings.

1:16:07.543 --> 1:16:08.644
I don't think I can.

1:16:08.677 --> 1:16:11.814
What the fuck is wrong
with you? And you too, Kelsey.

1:16:11.847 --> 1:16:14.149
- What about me?
- Who said this shit was easy?

1:16:14.183 --> 1:16:18.053
You guys can't just give up being
artists because you had a bad day.

1:16:18.087 --> 1:16:19.521
So you
haven't sold anything.

1:16:19.555 --> 1:16:22.224
Van Gogh sold one
painting his entire life.

1:16:22.258 --> 1:16:23.993
That's one more than I have.

1:16:24.026 --> 1:16:27.529
And he killed himself. I'm not
even dark enough to kill myself.

1:16:27.563 --> 1:16:28.998
Quinn!

1:16:29.031 --> 1:16:31.267
Shit.

1:16:31.300 --> 1:16:33.269
You son of a bitch.

1:16:33.302 --> 1:16:35.104
- What did I do?
- Claire.

1:16:35.137 --> 1:16:37.006
That's what you did.

1:16:37.039 --> 1:16:39.308
- I didn't know she was your girlfriend.
- Like fuck you didn't!

1:16:40.342 --> 1:16:43.112
Are you really
mad at me about Claire?

1:16:43.145 --> 1:16:44.546
What else?

1:16:45.581 --> 1:16:47.583
What about that blur
effect you stole from me?

1:16:47.616 --> 1:16:50.219
Remember that? You know
what I'm talking about.

1:16:50.252 --> 1:16:54.390
Tell me. What I never understood
is you stole it from me.

1:16:54.423 --> 1:16:56.892
So why were you always mad
at me for doing... Ow! Ooh!

1:16:56.925 --> 1:16:59.428
- Oh!
- You were never gonna make a fucking dime!

1:16:59.461 --> 1:17:02.031
Now get this asshole off of me.
Bruising my integrity!

1:17:02.064 --> 1:17:03.532
- Ow!
- Oh!

1:17:05.434 --> 1:17:07.169
- I'm sorry.
- You fuck!

1:17:07.202 --> 1:17:10.439
- Chill, chill! Chill!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! Break it up.

1:17:10.472 --> 1:17:12.875
I didn't fucking mean it! Jesus.

1:17:15.277 --> 1:17:17.046
He's not really mad
about any of that stuff.

1:17:18.580 --> 1:17:21.083
He's mad about this one time in school
when we got drunk and fooled around.

1:17:21.116 --> 1:17:22.551
You and Austin?

1:17:22.584 --> 1:17:25.988
Yeah. We were just drunk
or something, and it happened.

1:17:26.021 --> 1:17:29.024
It wasn't a big deal,
or I didn't think it was.

1:17:29.058 --> 1:17:32.061
But then he wanted it
to keep going. And I'm not gay.

1:17:32.094 --> 1:17:34.630
Well, Austin's not gay either.

1:17:34.663 --> 1:17:36.231
Who knows, man?

1:17:37.232 --> 1:17:39.935
He had a girlfriend back then.
Pretty one, too.

1:17:39.968 --> 1:17:41.470
Yeah, Jackie Hernandez.

1:17:42.371 --> 1:17:44.273
You messed around with her, too.

1:17:44.306 --> 1:17:47.176
- How'd you know about that?
- I thought everybody knew about that.

1:17:48.310 --> 1:17:51.280
- You make it sound like I'm an asshole or something.
- I'm not.

1:17:51.313 --> 1:17:53.282
He started
getting mean with me.

1:17:53.315 --> 1:17:56.218
The point is I can paint circles
around that guy.

1:17:56.251 --> 1:17:58.520
He thinks because he's got
a fucking gallery behind him

1:17:58.554 --> 1:18:00.989
that he's Francis fucking Bacon.
He's a fucking hack!

1:18:01.023 --> 1:18:03.325
- He's really not that bad.
- Oh, fuck him!

1:18:03.359 --> 1:18:05.060
I'm going
back to my studio.

1:18:05.094 --> 1:18:07.496
I'm gonna paint some shit
that he won't even understand.

1:18:07.529 --> 1:18:09.531
This place is a mess.

1:18:12.067 --> 1:18:13.902
I've been having a rough time.

1:18:16.972 --> 1:18:18.140
What is this?

1:18:19.375 --> 1:18:22.878
That's what I've been working
on, some nudes of my mother.

1:18:24.279 --> 1:18:27.082
- Jesus. That's not you, is it?
- No.

1:18:27.116 --> 1:18:31.320
Look, man, I know you... you... you've
been going through some stuff, you know.

1:18:31.353 --> 1:18:34.923
But you're... you're putting it
into the work.

1:18:34.957 --> 1:18:39.328
That's... that's a w... I haven't
even figured out how to do that yet.

1:18:40.596 --> 1:18:42.931
"Dare to dream."

1:18:43.632 --> 1:18:44.600
I love this.

1:18:44.633 --> 1:18:47.636
Uh, I'm... still... I'm...
figuring 'em out still.

1:18:47.669 --> 1:18:49.671
I... I got to show these
to Charles when you're done.

1:18:49.706 --> 1:18:51.607
- You would do that?
- Yeah, man.

1:18:51.640 --> 1:18:54.410
You th... you think
he would hang them?

1:18:54.443 --> 1:18:56.145
It's a little dark for him.

1:18:56.178 --> 1:18:59.915
But I think that he could
make a big deal about this.

1:19:00.983 --> 1:19:01.984
Really?

1:19:04.386 --> 1:19:05.621
It's dark?

1:19:14.764 --> 1:19:17.700
How much
longer is this gonna take?

1:19:19.535 --> 1:19:22.037
Claire, look,
we like the artist.

1:19:22.070 --> 1:19:24.673
But we set aside
a lot of stuff for this today.

1:19:24.707 --> 1:19:29.311
I am so sorry, Tony.
Um, he says he's on his way.

1:19:44.193 --> 1:19:46.428
Where the fuck have you been?

1:19:47.629 --> 1:19:50.966
We were supposed to be at the
Burkharts' four hours ago.

1:19:51.768 --> 1:19:55.437
- Oh. Yeah, what time is it?
- I was there.

1:19:55.471 --> 1:19:58.207
I kept calling you.

1:19:58.240 --> 1:19:59.241
Fuck!

1:20:00.409 --> 1:20:04.246
- I could come now.
- It's too late. You fucked it up!

1:20:04.279 --> 1:20:06.014
Seriously?
I'm just a little late.

1:20:06.048 --> 1:20:08.350
It took me two weeks to get them
to agree to talk to you.

1:20:08.383 --> 1:20:11.220
You think you're the only fucking artist
in the city that wants to work with them?

1:20:11.253 --> 1:20:13.555
They work with artists, right?
I mean, they know how we are.

1:20:13.589 --> 1:20:16.358
- We show up late.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

1:20:17.626 --> 1:20:20.395
Look, I don't know what year
you're living in,

1:20:20.429 --> 1:20:23.232
but artists work for a living
these days.

1:20:23.265 --> 1:20:26.635
And they work really fucking hard if
they want to make any money at it.

1:20:26.668 --> 1:20:29.271
Yeah, I work hard at it.
I was working all night!

1:20:30.539 --> 1:20:34.076
You have to see these paintings I'm doing.
I did some really cool stuff.

1:21:04.172 --> 1:21:05.274
You don't like them.

1:21:06.375 --> 1:21:10.178
No, I don't like them.
How could that surprise you?

1:21:10.212 --> 1:21:13.315
Maybe I finally did
some work that scares you.

1:21:13.348 --> 1:21:14.817
Is that what
you're trying to do?

1:21:15.852 --> 1:21:18.487
You always said
that you liked my work, so...

1:21:18.520 --> 1:21:20.723
I always said
I liked your work.

1:21:24.326 --> 1:21:25.427
You didn't?

1:21:26.361 --> 1:21:28.130
Why...- why
would you lie about that?

1:21:28.163 --> 1:21:30.299
Because I love you.
Because I'm your mother.

1:21:30.332 --> 1:21:32.100
You wanted
me to be an artist.

1:21:32.134 --> 1:21:34.136
I wanted you to be happy.

1:21:34.169 --> 1:21:36.104
You were always such a sad kid.

1:21:36.138 --> 1:21:38.507
And then you took that art class in Mrs.
Kudacoppen's sixth grade class,

1:21:38.540 --> 1:21:41.643
and it made you seem a little less unhappy.
So yes, I encouraged you.

1:21:41.677 --> 1:21:44.646
You lied to me my whole life?

1:21:44.681 --> 1:21:46.648
You said that you liked my work!

1:21:46.683 --> 1:21:48.517
I always thought
you'd get better.

1:21:48.550 --> 1:21:50.485
Nobody wanted you
to get better more than I did.

1:21:50.519 --> 1:21:52.689
You never thought
any of it was any good?

1:21:52.722 --> 1:21:55.257
It just seemed like
you were trying too hard.

1:21:55.290 --> 1:21:57.492
Why didn't you tell me the truth

1:21:57.526 --> 1:22:01.597
and save me from the humiliation and torture
that I put myself through to be good at this?

1:22:01.630 --> 1:22:04.701
You have your whole life
to let the world beat you down.

1:22:04.734 --> 1:22:06.201
Why do you need
to hear that from me?

1:22:06.234 --> 1:22:07.804
I'm sorry I wasn't
good enough for you.

1:22:07.837 --> 1:22:10.172
- Has your father seen these?
- No.

1:22:10.205 --> 1:22:14.142
That's good. 'Cause I honestly
don't think he'd like them either.

1:22:14.176 --> 1:22:17.679
Mom, these are going up in a few
weeks at the Reynolds Gallery.

1:22:17.714 --> 1:22:19.749
They love them.
Austin Gamby's presenting it.

1:22:20.750 --> 1:22:22.451
It's gonna be a big deal.

1:23:11.433 --> 1:23:15.437
Well, I wanted you to meet
the artist, he's Dan Pierson.

1:23:16.438 --> 1:23:19.675
Austin. Can I show you something
over here for a minute?

1:24:05.353 --> 1:24:06.254
Wow.

1:24:07.489 --> 1:24:09.458
I mean,
I knew they were nudes, but I...

1:24:09.491 --> 1:24:12.260
Yeah. Do you like 'em?

1:24:13.328 --> 1:24:14.964
I think they're really good.

1:24:16.298 --> 1:24:19.802
Provocative, obviously.
I mean, you wanted them to be dark, right?

1:24:19.836 --> 1:24:22.004
Mom w... didn't
warn you or anything?

1:24:23.338 --> 1:24:24.741
No.

1:24:24.774 --> 1:24:27.576
No, it... it's better this way.

1:24:27.609 --> 1:24:32.514
I just wish I could see them like you
weren't my son and she wasn't my wife.

1:24:33.750 --> 1:24:35.617
Well, I hope they sell.

1:24:35.650 --> 1:24:38.620
They got sex in 'em.
It's always good, right?

1:24:53.936 --> 1:24:55.570
You're Dan's friend, right?

1:24:55.604 --> 1:24:58.908
- Yeah. Hi. Quinn.
- Hi. I'm his father.

1:24:58.941 --> 1:25:01.409
I know. We
met once at Pratt.

1:25:01.443 --> 1:25:05.982
Mm. You're the one who, uh,
took the pictures, right? Of my wife?

1:25:06.015 --> 1:25:07.817
- No.
- No?

1:25:09.584 --> 1:25:12.354
I mean, did they tell you that?

1:25:12.387 --> 1:25:13.321
Yeah.

1:25:14.356 --> 1:25:15.323
Oh.

1:25:16.358 --> 1:25:17.526
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

1:25:17.559 --> 1:25:18.761
Guess I did.

1:25:20.428 --> 1:25:22.965
What do you, uh, what
do you think of the paintings?

1:25:26.068 --> 1:25:27.003
Sorry.

1:25:27.970 --> 1:25:30.405
- It's okay.
- I mean, the paintings are good.

1:25:30.438 --> 1:25:33.575
I don't know. I'm still trying
to process this.

1:25:35.510 --> 1:25:36.511
That's good.

1:25:38.114 --> 1:25:41.583
Maybe it'll give you
a new way of looking at her.

1:25:41.616 --> 1:25:43.119
I mean, she looks great in them.

1:25:43.152 --> 1:25:44.319
Huh.

1:25:46.655 --> 1:25:47.924
Can I buy you a drink?

1:25:49.658 --> 1:25:50.760
It's free.

1:25:58.067 --> 1:25:59.836
You didn't
tell him anything.

1:26:01.403 --> 1:26:04.707
What was I going to do?
I... I couldn't do it.

1:26:04.740 --> 1:26:07.777
I told him your friend came up,

1:26:07.810 --> 1:26:11.714
we did the pictures,
and that was it.

1:26:15.051 --> 1:26:17.820
I guess I could've
made it all up, right?

1:26:17.854 --> 1:26:20.122
You probably could've, yeah.

1:26:21.757 --> 1:26:23.860
But I'm glad you didn't.

1:26:31.767 --> 1:26:34.804
Hey. What are
you doing here?

1:26:34.837 --> 1:26:37.472
Well, this is the place to be.

1:26:37.505 --> 1:26:39.075
Uh, have you seen Brett?

1:26:39.108 --> 1:26:40.142
No, is he here?

1:26:40.176 --> 1:26:43.880
Yeah. Yeah, we came here
together from his gallery.

1:26:43.913 --> 1:26:46.615
I just bought your painting.

1:26:46.648 --> 1:26:48.550
- Wait, you just bought one?
- Yeah.

1:26:48.583 --> 1:26:51.153
You know, honestly, I didn't
think it would live up

1:26:51.187 --> 1:26:54.056
to whatever
I'd imagined it to be.

1:26:54.090 --> 1:26:56.491
But Brett was right. I love it.

1:26:56.524 --> 1:26:59.762
- I'm gonna put it next to my Vrubel.
- Really?

1:26:59.795 --> 1:27:01.898
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's awesome.

1:27:01.931 --> 1:27:04.901
Yeah, you should come
and check on it some time.

1:27:04.934 --> 1:27:06.468
Yeah, I would like that.

1:27:07.770 --> 1:27:09.038
Hey, sweetie.

1:27:09.071 --> 1:27:11.807
Oh, Chloe. Uh,
do you know Kelsey Fricke?

1:27:11.841 --> 1:27:14.777
- Of course, we were in school together.
- You never mentioned that.

1:27:14.810 --> 1:27:17.079
No, why would I?

1:27:17.113 --> 1:27:18.647
Hey, Chloe.

1:27:18.681 --> 1:27:20.548
We're engaged.

1:27:20.582 --> 1:27:21.951
Did he tell you?

1:27:21.984 --> 1:27:23.518
- As it's been a bit of a...
- No.

1:27:23.551 --> 1:27:24.954
...whirlwind.

1:27:31.827 --> 1:27:33.129
Uh, just...

1:27:35.131 --> 1:27:37.700
- Wait, wait, Kelsey, what's wrong?
- Are you serious?

1:27:37.733 --> 1:27:39.702
I mean, Chloe Brown?

1:27:39.735 --> 1:27:44.774
I've expected a model or an architect,
anybody except her fucking vagina.

1:27:44.807 --> 1:27:45.942
Her vagina?

1:27:46.842 --> 1:27:49.812
But I... I think
her vagina's okay.

1:27:49.845 --> 1:27:51.681
- Is there something I don't know?
- No!

1:27:51.714 --> 1:27:53.983
That's exactly it, there's nothing
that you don't know about it.

1:27:54.016 --> 1:27:55.952
It's exactly
what you'd expect it to be.

1:27:55.985 --> 1:27:58.120
Look, Kelsey, I don't really
understand what you're talking about,

1:27:58.154 --> 1:28:02.657
but I... I don't really want
my vaginas to be complicated.

1:28:02.692 --> 1:28:03.859
Not like my art.

1:28:19.041 --> 1:28:19.976
Hey.

1:28:20.910 --> 1:28:21.944
I tell you the news?

1:28:21.978 --> 1:28:24.113
- Yeah.
- He bought it.

1:28:35.891 --> 1:28:37.827
Charles just
sold the last painting.

1:28:37.860 --> 1:28:39.795
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

1:28:39.829 --> 1:28:42.564
He wanted to tell you himself,
but he's still working out the deal.

1:28:43.833 --> 1:28:46.035
Holy shit.

1:28:46.068 --> 1:28:47.937
I think I see
Ramon over at the bar.

1:28:47.970 --> 1:28:49.872
You go. I'll go find Dan.

1:28:49.905 --> 1:28:51.040
Great.

1:28:57.847 --> 1:29:00.282
This is such a big deal.

1:29:00.316 --> 1:29:02.517
Look how much
attention you're getting.

1:29:03.585 --> 1:29:06.554
- They all sold.
- Oh my God, that's amazing.

1:29:06.588 --> 1:29:08.891
I'm so excited for you.

1:29:08.924 --> 1:29:09.992
Yeah?

1:29:10.026 --> 1:29:11.861
Of course. I love you.

1:29:13.362 --> 1:29:14.797
I love you, too.

1:29:19.135 --> 1:29:22.104
Mm, wait. Greg will see us.

1:29:23.706 --> 1:29:24.940
He did see us.

1:29:29.945 --> 1:29:31.646
Ugh!

1:29:31.679 --> 1:29:33.215
Come on, babe.
Let's get out of here.

1:29:34.283 --> 1:29:36.786
This place is full of freaks.

1:29:36.819 --> 1:29:39.755
Ow.

1:29:39.789 --> 1:29:41.090
Oh shit.

1:29:41.123 --> 1:29:43.092
Are you okay?

1:29:43.125 --> 1:29:44.927
I told you to dump her.

1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:48.596
Oh, man,
that's gonna bruise.

1:29:48.630 --> 1:29:51.267
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good, man.

1:29:51.300 --> 1:29:54.370
Kelsey, I heard
you sold a painting.

1:29:54.403 --> 1:29:55.738
You heard that?

1:29:55.771 --> 1:29:57.106
Word gets around.

1:29:57.139 --> 1:29:59.809
Come on,
let's go get a drink.

1:29:59.842 --> 1:30:01.243
Hmm.

1:30:04.380 --> 1:30:06.115
Yeah, it's okay.

1:30:06.148 --> 1:30:07.917
I'll catch up with you guys.

1:30:10.319 --> 1:30:11.287
You sure?

1:30:12.254 --> 1:30:14.123
Yeah. It's cool.

1:31:11.046 --> 1:31:13.015
Dude, can I borrow that?

1:31:13.048 --> 1:31:14.250
Sure, man. What you got?

1:31:28.130 --> 1:31:30.199
I'm trying to see
what he's making.

1:31:32.334 --> 1:31:36.071
Hey, dawg. Take this from me, put
this money for me in my... on her hands.

1:31:51.954 --> 1:31:53.322
Nice and clean.

1:31:53.355 --> 1:31:56.091
Look how fast he's
doing this though. That's crazy.
