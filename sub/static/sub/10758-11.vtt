WEBVTT

00:08.407 --> 00:09.574
So when's Freddie coming in?

00:09.783 --> 00:12.327
He's arriving in a few hours.
I'm picking him up at the airport.

00:12.536 --> 00:14.204
Gosh, you know,
I'm so excited to see him.

00:14.454 --> 00:16.998
And it was Lilith's turn this year
to have him for his birthday,

00:17.207 --> 00:19.084
but apparently
there was an accident at the lab.

00:19.292 --> 00:21.253
One of her monkeys bit her
on the tongue.

00:22.128 --> 00:23.964
What exactly was she doing
with the monkey?

00:25.507 --> 00:27.592
She's was teaching them
sign language.

00:27.968 --> 00:30.095
I guess one of them
made a disparaging remark

00:30.262 --> 00:31.513
about her new haircut.

00:31.721 --> 00:33.848
She stuck her tongue out.

00:35.058 --> 00:37.185
Wow, how bad
does a haircut have to be

00:37.394 --> 00:39.854
for a monkey to hate it?

00:40.146 --> 00:42.816
Well, I guess I'm just gonna have
to get myself a cup of coffee.

00:42.982 --> 00:46.361
Oh, somebody dropped a wallet.

00:46.945 --> 00:48.404
Is he cute?

00:48.655 --> 00:50.532
It's hard to tell
from a driver's license photo,

00:50.740 --> 00:54.619
but he is 5-foot-6, weighs 200 pounds,
and has corrective lenses.

00:54.828 --> 00:56.871
Leave it on the floor.

00:58.164 --> 01:01.459
Well, thank God I don't share
your good-deeds-for-hunks-only policy.

01:02.835 --> 01:03.836
Excuse me,

01:04.003 --> 01:06.589
- I found this on the floor...
- Is that my wallet you got there?

01:06.756 --> 01:08.716
Is it? Well, I found it
on the floor over there.

01:08.883 --> 01:10.551
I was about to drop it
off at the counter.

01:10.760 --> 01:12.470
Please, no reward.

01:12.679 --> 01:14.931
- What happened to my cash?
- Well, I don't know.

01:15.098 --> 01:16.349
It was empty when I found it.

01:16.516 --> 01:19.560
Yeah, right.
I had seven bucks in here.

01:19.769 --> 01:22.230
Well, I'm sure some lucky thief
is off enjoying a matinee

01:22.397 --> 01:24.440
and a small soda.

01:24.774 --> 01:28.111
At least you left my credit card. Jerk.

01:29.612 --> 01:31.572
Would you please bring me
my usual?

01:32.532 --> 01:34.075
Can you believe that guy?

01:34.283 --> 01:36.410
I do him a favour,
he accuses me of stealing.

01:36.619 --> 01:38.871
Oh, please.
The world is full of creeps like that.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.414
Haven't you figured that out yet?

01:40.623 --> 01:44.001
I'm sorry, Roz, but I still believe
that people are basically good.

01:45.544 --> 01:47.171
Hey, guys, I'm glad you're here.

01:47.380 --> 01:50.675
- I need to talk to you about something.
- What can I do for you, Bulldog?

01:51.050 --> 01:52.968
My mom's having bypass surgery
tomorrow morning,

01:53.135 --> 01:56.013
and I'd like to sit up with her tonight
at the hospital.

01:56.263 --> 01:58.682
But I gotta work the 11 -to-1 spot.

01:58.891 --> 02:00.184
I don't suppose you'd think...

02:00.392 --> 02:04.647
Oh, right. Like we don't know
there's a big fight in Vegas tonight.

02:04.897 --> 02:08.150
Look, I know I've jerked you guys
around before, but this is serious.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.443
Bulldog, I'm sorry.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.946
Frederick's coming in tonight.
It's his birthday.

02:12.404 --> 02:16.116
Okay, doc. Never mind.
I understand.

02:17.159 --> 02:19.370
Hello, Bernice Brisco's room,
please.

02:19.578 --> 02:22.706
I hope my mom's around
to celebrate her next birthday.

02:23.248 --> 02:25.376
Hi, Mom, it's Bobby.

02:26.669 --> 02:28.921
Look, I'm gonna have to
work tonight after all.

02:29.171 --> 02:31.006
Bulldog, wait a minute.
You know what?

02:31.256 --> 02:34.218
Frederick will be asleep by 11:00.
I guess we could take your slot.

02:34.426 --> 02:36.553
Are you insane?
How can you be so gullible?

02:36.762 --> 02:38.889
He is not talking to his mother.

02:39.431 --> 02:42.768
Does somebody have a boo-boo
on her heart?

02:44.686 --> 02:46.188
Is someone gonna have
to open you up

02:46.355 --> 02:49.608
with those big old rib spreaders?

02:51.193 --> 02:54.321
Oh, Mrs. Brisco, I'm so sorry.

02:56.198 --> 02:59.368
Listen, I just wanted you to know
that we'll fill in for Bobby tonight.

02:59.534 --> 03:01.286
Thanks a million, you guys.

03:01.453 --> 03:05.791
- I'd better get back to the hospital.
- God bless, Bulldog.

03:06.041 --> 03:09.336
Oh, I can't believe I said that.
That poor woman.

03:09.544 --> 03:11.380
- We're outta here.
- Our flight doesn't leave

03:11.546 --> 03:13.882
- for another two hours.
- I gotta stop by my mom's first.

03:14.049 --> 03:16.134
I owe her 50 bucks
and case of Schlitz.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:38.156 --> 03:39.616
Should I even ask?

03:39.991 --> 03:42.077
These balloons come
in an unsealed package,

03:42.243 --> 03:44.412
covered with some mysterious dust,

03:44.579 --> 03:46.664
straight from some
Southeast Asian sweatshop.

03:46.831 --> 03:49.125
- Doesn't that worry you?
- Oh, you bet it does.

03:49.334 --> 03:51.836
I remember back in Korea
we'd crouch in our foxholes

03:52.003 --> 03:55.799
scared to death those bastards
were gonna drop balloons on us.

03:57.425 --> 03:59.093
The doorman called.
They're on their way.

03:59.260 --> 04:01.471
Don't know how much
of a surprise it's gonna be anyway.

04:01.679 --> 04:03.932
- You did the same thing last year.
- That's the point.

04:04.098 --> 04:06.100
He'd never suspect
I'd do it two years in a row.

04:06.351 --> 04:09.062
I must say I feel a bit bad for Freddie.
None of his mates are here,

04:09.270 --> 04:11.773
just the three of us old fogies
yelling "Surprise."

04:12.023 --> 04:14.317
Any party that he's at with you
is gonna be a treat for him.

04:14.525 --> 04:15.777
He's got a little crush on you.

04:16.027 --> 04:17.820
If you really want Frederick
to enjoy himself,

04:18.029 --> 04:21.074
he especially likes you
in that little blue cocktail dress.

04:23.284 --> 04:26.204
I'm not sure that dress is appropriate
for a child's birthday party.

04:26.370 --> 04:29.540
Well, it's hardly a party.
It's just us fogies.

04:30.625 --> 04:33.002
You know, Frederick, your granddad
really wanted to be here,

04:33.211 --> 04:36.339
but he had an important
Rotary Club meeting.

04:36.881 --> 04:39.967
- What?
- Not another surprise party.

04:41.469 --> 04:44.222
- What are you talking about?
- Just like last year.

04:44.472 --> 04:48.142
Oh, Lord, all right, all right,
I'll tell you what, just don't let on, okay?

04:48.392 --> 04:51.479
You know how he loves this stuff.
Just act surprised, all right?

04:51.646 --> 04:53.397
The hardest thing
is pretending to be fooled

04:53.564 --> 04:55.983
- by the trick candles.
- Oh, gosh.

04:56.150 --> 04:58.986
You think it's hard now,
wait until you're my age.

05:00.488 --> 05:02.406
Surprise!

05:02.656 --> 05:05.826
- Oh, wow! I'm so surprised.
- You see? I told you.

05:05.993 --> 05:08.621
- Hey, Freddie.
- How are you doing? Happy birthday.

05:08.829 --> 05:10.998
- Hi.
- Hi!

05:11.165 --> 05:13.083
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

05:13.417 --> 05:15.711
Just let me get the phone.

05:17.505 --> 05:19.006
Hello?

05:19.173 --> 05:20.925
Yes, who's calling, please?

05:21.091 --> 05:22.551
Wewef?

05:22.760 --> 05:24.219
Anyone here know a Wewef?

05:24.929 --> 05:26.555
Oh, Lilith.

05:29.183 --> 05:30.809
Yes, hello, Lilith.

05:31.185 --> 05:33.395
What's that?
Oh, right, yes, of course he's here.

05:33.687 --> 05:36.231
It's your mom. Why don't you take it
into your granddad's room?

05:36.440 --> 05:38.776
- Okay. Hi, Mom.
- Let's get the cake ready.

05:38.942 --> 05:40.444
Oh, yes, yes. Oh, Frasier,

05:40.611 --> 05:42.738
I think you're going to be
pleasantly surprised.

05:44.615 --> 05:47.409
<i>- Voila!
- What the hell is that?</i>

05:47.618 --> 05:50.954
It's Louis Pasteur,
Freddie's favorite scientist.

05:52.372 --> 05:54.666
What child wouldn't be thrilled
with a coconut death mask

05:54.875 --> 05:56.877
on his birthday?

05:57.794 --> 05:59.713
Frasier,
what happened to your jacket?

05:59.963 --> 06:02.758
Oh, at the airport, I helped this woman
get her dog into her car.

06:02.966 --> 06:05.927
- Oh, I hope at least it was in a crate.
- Yes, very heavy crate.

06:06.136 --> 06:08.722
I had to hold it at arm's length
so that what I chose to believe

06:08.889 --> 06:11.391
was drool wouldn't run out
onto my shoes.

06:13.560 --> 06:16.855
Eight blocks later I finally load
little Fido into her backseat,

06:17.064 --> 06:18.899
woman drives off
without so much as a thank-you

06:19.066 --> 06:20.984
or an offer to give me a ride
to the airport.

06:21.151 --> 06:23.487
I responded with the time-honored
gesture of disapproval,

06:23.653 --> 06:26.698
but on the upswing
I caught my finger on the jacket and...

06:26.907 --> 06:28.241
Oh, thank you.

06:28.742 --> 06:32.579
I must say my belief in people's basic
decency has taken a beating today.

06:32.746 --> 06:35.415
Earlier, I returned a man's wallet.
He accused me of stealing.

06:35.665 --> 06:37.459
Well, it just proves
what I always say,

06:37.667 --> 06:39.502
a good Samaritan
is nothing but a good target.

06:39.669 --> 06:42.047
I'm sorry, Dad, I'm not ready
to be quite that cynical yet.

06:42.255 --> 06:43.965
- He's off the phone.
- Oh, good. All right.

06:44.174 --> 06:45.425
You can believe what you want,

06:45.592 --> 06:49.679
but I think people are born rotten
and every year they get worse.

06:49.846 --> 06:53.349
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

06:55.018 --> 07:01.316
<i>Welcome back to the night-owl edition
of The Dr. Frasier Crane Show.</i>

07:01.775 --> 07:05.028
We have Stephen on line two.

07:05.361 --> 07:07.447
Go ahead, caller, you're on the air.

07:07.614 --> 07:09.324
<i>I think I'm losing my mind,
Dr. Crane.</i>

07:09.532 --> 07:12.702
<i>People are talking to me
through my radio.</i>

07:12.869 --> 07:16.122
<i>- Why do you think that?
- There it is again.</i>

07:20.043 --> 07:23.963
<i>- Turn your radio down.
- Now it's giving me orders.</i>

07:25.548 --> 07:27.467
Stephen, turn your radio down.

07:27.633 --> 07:30.595
<i>It knows my name.</i>

07:30.970 --> 07:33.514
Stephen, listen to me,
this is your radio talking.

07:33.723 --> 07:36.267
I'm a very smart radio,
and I care about you,

07:36.476 --> 07:38.144
and I want you to turn me off.

07:38.311 --> 07:40.938
Go to bed and seek counselling
in the morning.

07:41.147 --> 07:42.398
<i>Okay.</i>

07:42.565 --> 07:45.359
<i>Sorry, doc, can't talk anymore.</i>

07:49.238 --> 07:52.408
Well, I'd like to end tonight
on a philosophical note.

07:52.575 --> 07:55.953
You see, earlier today,
I helped some people.

07:56.162 --> 08:02.418
I returned a man's wallet,
and I aided a woman at the airport.

08:02.585 --> 08:03.878
And in return,

08:04.086 --> 08:09.884
I was accused of being a thief,
and my favourite jacket was ruined.

08:16.515 --> 08:19.393
I was so disappointed
by the events of the day

08:19.602 --> 08:21.562
that, on my way
to work here tonight,

08:21.770 --> 08:24.190
I almost passed an elderly man
with a flat tire

08:24.440 --> 08:26.650
without stopping to help him.

08:29.528 --> 08:31.030
What the hell are you doing?

08:31.280 --> 08:33.365
I asked myself.

08:40.121 --> 08:43.500
How would I feel
if I were in this man's position

08:43.708 --> 08:44.918
and no one stopped to help me?

08:45.127 --> 08:47.796
Well, I did pull over,
I helped the man,

08:47.963 --> 08:50.507
and frankly, it felt great.

08:50.716 --> 08:54.011
So without sounding preachy,
I would like to advise you all

08:54.219 --> 08:57.764
to do a good deed once in a while,

08:57.973 --> 09:02.519
if not for the sake of others,
but then, well, for your own sake.

09:02.728 --> 09:05.772
Thank you.
Now, let's go to station ID.

09:06.899 --> 09:08.859
Roz, do you mind?

09:09.985 --> 09:12.404
What is your problem?
I'm getting ready for bed.

09:12.571 --> 09:14.656
Alice gets me up
at the crack of dawn.

09:14.823 --> 09:17.909
If I get all this taken care of,
I get an extra half hour of sleep.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.620
Well, at least you spared me
the spectacle of flossing.

09:20.829 --> 09:23.373
Thanks for reminding me.
I had corn.

09:27.169 --> 09:28.920
And we're back.

09:29.087 --> 09:33.091
It seems that we've got time
for one more call.

09:33.425 --> 09:36.761
Don't bother, Roz, I'll get it.

09:40.098 --> 09:43.518
Go ahead, caller.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane. I'm listening.

09:43.685 --> 09:45.562
<i>Hi, Dr. Crane, this is Ralph.</i>

09:45.770 --> 09:47.522
<i>The guy whose tire
you changed tonight.</i>

09:47.689 --> 09:50.191
Ralph! Well,
what a wonderful surprise.

09:50.358 --> 09:53.361
Let me first say to our listeners,
this call was not solicited in any way.

09:53.528 --> 09:54.696
You go ahead, Ralph.

09:54.946 --> 09:57.449
<i>Dr. Crane, I was just wondering,
do you wear cuff links?</i>

09:57.615 --> 10:01.327
Well, yes, as a matter of fact, I do,
but there's no need to buy me a gift.

10:01.536 --> 10:04.831
<i>A gift? You scratched the hell out
of my paint job with those things.</i>

10:05.039 --> 10:07.041
<i>You owe me money.</i>

10:07.542 --> 10:09.419
You can't be serious.

10:09.627 --> 10:11.379
How much damage
could cuff links do to a car

10:11.546 --> 10:15.466
whose side window consists
of duct tape and a Hefty bag?

10:15.633 --> 10:18.219
<i>Well, you'll find out
when my lawyer sends you the bill.</i>

10:18.386 --> 10:22.682
Let me remind you again, listeners,
that call was not solicited.

10:37.989 --> 10:39.282
<i>Oh, great.</i>

10:39.490 --> 10:41.617
<i>Somebody else
in need of a good Samaritan.</i>

10:44.328 --> 10:47.540
<i>Maybe if I ignore her,
she'll stop waving.</i>

10:49.584 --> 10:52.879
<i>But what am I gonna do?
Just leave her standing in the rain?</i>

10:53.504 --> 10:56.424
<i>Then again,
every one of my good deeds today</i>

10:56.591 --> 10:59.510
<i>has ended up biting me in the butt.</i>

11:08.519 --> 11:11.022
Such nasty weather.
May I offer you a ride?

11:11.188 --> 11:13.357
Oh, thank you.

11:20.448 --> 11:22.283
I didn't think anyone
was gonna stop tonight.

11:22.450 --> 11:26.245
Well, chivalry may be on life support,
but it's not dead.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.664
- Oh, seat warmers.
- Yes, they're standard.

11:28.873 --> 11:31.417
There's a little control on the side
if you want more leg room.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.794
- Now where can I take you?
- It's up to you.

11:33.961 --> 11:37.339
We can get a room
or we can do it here in the car.

11:40.301 --> 11:42.094
Oh, dear God.

11:42.303 --> 11:45.472
- You are a prostitute.
- How far do these go back?

11:46.056 --> 11:48.392
Look, I'm sorry.
There's been a mistake.

11:48.559 --> 11:50.602
- Oh, don't be nervous, baby.
- I'm not nervous.

11:50.811 --> 11:54.106
- Would you please put your seat up?
- I'll put it any way you like it, honey.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.901
Stop talking to me that way.
For God's sake! All right, now please,

11:58.068 --> 12:00.571
I'm sorry about this misunderstanding,
but get out of my car.

12:00.737 --> 12:03.490
- Why the hell did you pick me up?
- I was trying to be a gentleman.

12:03.657 --> 12:05.117
Now get out.

12:05.576 --> 12:07.369
I'm not walking all the way
back to my corner.

12:07.578 --> 12:10.622
- Give me some money for a cab.
- All right, fine.

12:10.914 --> 12:13.750
Oh, Lord, I guess I must have left
my wallet at the station.

12:13.917 --> 12:15.752
How in the hell
were you going to pay for me?

12:16.003 --> 12:18.338
I wasn't going to pay for you!

12:18.505 --> 12:21.049
Oh, here's a $20 bill. Now get out.

12:21.925 --> 12:24.720
God. Get out. Get out.
Hurry, get out now.

12:24.928 --> 12:26.847
It's too late. They've seen us.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.974
I don't believe
this is happening to me.

12:32.769 --> 12:34.062
Hello, officer.

12:34.271 --> 12:35.939
Just how fast was I going?

12:36.523 --> 12:37.774
Hey, don't I know you?

12:38.024 --> 12:40.360
- No, no, I don't believe so.
- I'm not talking to you.

12:40.610 --> 12:42.112
Didn't I bust you last week?

12:42.362 --> 12:46.116
Give me a break, buddy.
I'm trying to earn a living here.

12:51.705 --> 12:54.207
Was it really necessary
to take my belt and tie?

12:54.374 --> 12:56.751
Standard procedure.
It's for your own protection.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.629
For God's sake,
you had me in the drunk tank.

12:59.796 --> 13:02.799
If I wanted to kill myself,
I would've taken a deep breath.

13:06.636 --> 13:09.013
- Frasier!
- Niles.

13:09.222 --> 13:12.684
You certainly took your sweet time.
I've been waiting here two hours.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.018
Well, I'm sorry, Niles.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.604
I guess what with the pillow fight
in the holding tank

13:16.813 --> 13:19.107
and the pre-mug shot makeover,
time just got away from me.

13:19.315 --> 13:21.234
Will you stop it!

13:23.653 --> 13:26.531
Just bail me out of here. I can't stand
another minute in this place.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.283
All right. Excuse me.

13:28.491 --> 13:32.036
If you could get our bill together,
we're ready to settle up here.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.747
It's 500 bucks.

13:34.998 --> 13:38.209
Five hundred... Frasier,
I don't have that kind of cash on me.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.711
Put it on your credit card.

13:40.002 --> 13:41.754
And have "bail" appear
on my statement?

13:41.921 --> 13:44.215
Do you know the kind of junk mail
I would get...?

13:44.424 --> 13:45.758
Just do it.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.802
Okay.

13:48.511 --> 13:50.221
There you are.

13:51.097 --> 13:56.018
So, what happened? A prostitute?

13:56.769 --> 14:00.523
Please, I told you on the phone,
I didn't know she was a prostitute.

14:00.690 --> 14:02.567
I saw a woman stranded in the rain.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.611
Naturally, I offered her a ride.
Before I knew it,

14:05.778 --> 14:09.740
I was handcuffed to this bench,
surrounded by this motley assortment

14:09.949 --> 14:13.661
of other wrongfully accused
gentlemen.

14:16.956 --> 14:20.668
- Sir, your card didn't go through.
- What?

14:21.627 --> 14:23.921
That's right, Maris' lawyers
had my credit limit reduced.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.131
Oh, no.

14:25.381 --> 14:27.424
Been so bad this week
when I went to the cheese shop

14:27.633 --> 14:30.845
for their Around the World platter,
they cut me off at Luxembourg.

14:32.054 --> 14:33.931
Would you please call Dad
and get him down here?

14:34.139 --> 14:35.683
All right. All right.

14:38.310 --> 14:41.605
Yeah, Dad, hi.
My credit card was declined.

14:41.814 --> 14:45.985
Well, we need yours. Yeah.
Well, right, yeah, I'll see you soon.

14:46.235 --> 14:48.696
This is intolerable.
It'll take him 20 minutes to get here.

14:48.904 --> 14:51.031
- No, no, he's waiting in the car.
- What?

14:51.240 --> 14:52.658
Why didn't he come in?

14:52.825 --> 14:55.285
Frasier, this was his old precinct.

14:55.494 --> 14:58.163
When we pulled up outside,
I saw a look on his face I haven't seen

14:58.330 --> 15:01.667
since he drove us home from our first
and only Little League game.

15:03.919 --> 15:06.797
- Oh, Dad.
- Hey, hold it down, will you?

15:07.005 --> 15:09.800
Dad, I'm so sorry.
What happened was...

15:10.008 --> 15:12.386
No, I don't need to know.
I didn't come down here to judge.

15:12.594 --> 15:15.472
- You're my son, and I love you.
- Yes, for God's sakes, Dad, I didn't...

15:15.681 --> 15:17.558
Why don't we pay up,
and get out of here, okay?

15:17.766 --> 15:19.059
- Hey, Marty.
- Hey, Fred.

15:19.268 --> 15:21.186
Listen, I wouldn't take this
too hard, Marty.

15:21.353 --> 15:23.021
You remember
Captain Petchesky's son

15:23.188 --> 15:25.023
turned out to be
the Colman Park pervert.

15:25.190 --> 15:28.110
- Yeah, thanks.
- And Sergeant O'Brien's daughter

15:28.360 --> 15:30.696
- does all them cable movies.
- Yeah, I heard.

15:30.862 --> 15:32.531
You can pick her out.
She's got his chin.

15:32.698 --> 15:35.492
Yeah, could we just
get on with it here?

15:36.535 --> 15:38.078
Dad, will you let me explain?

15:38.286 --> 15:40.163
Frasier, look, I understand.
I was in the Army.

15:40.372 --> 15:41.665
We all have our urges.

15:41.873 --> 15:43.750
- But you don't understand.
- Just sign here.

15:43.959 --> 15:45.669
All that happened was...

15:45.877 --> 15:48.171
Bye, Dr. Crane.
Sorry I got you arrested.

15:48.380 --> 15:51.174
Oh, that's all right, Crystal.
These things happen.

15:57.222 --> 15:59.599
He had a wig on.

16:01.393 --> 16:05.522
- You're my son and I love you.
- Oh, would you stop saying that!

16:08.650 --> 16:10.318
I still don't know
what you were thinking.

16:10.485 --> 16:12.195
The middle of the night,
deserted street,

16:12.404 --> 16:13.822
picking up a strange woman.

16:14.072 --> 16:16.282
A very strange woman.

16:17.992 --> 16:19.994
Well, obviously I wasn't thinking.

16:20.161 --> 16:21.746
Thank God now it's all over.

16:21.913 --> 16:24.123
I can just spend a quiet weekend here
with Frederick.

16:24.332 --> 16:27.710
Oh, dear God!

16:28.169 --> 16:31.422
"Doc's Pal is a Mock Gal."

16:34.425 --> 16:36.261
Will this nightmare never end?

16:36.427 --> 16:39.180
Now listen, Dad, we're bound to get
a lot of calls about this thing.

16:39.347 --> 16:41.849
Please do not answer the phone.
Don't talk to anybody.

16:42.016 --> 16:45.144
Let the machine get it. Don't give them
anything they can turn tawdry.

16:45.353 --> 16:46.729
Yeah, I live with Dr. Crane.

16:46.938 --> 16:48.940
Yeah, there's quite a bit
of massage involved.

16:49.190 --> 16:50.191
Daphne!

16:50.358 --> 16:52.276
Mostly around the hips,
thighs, and buttocks.

16:52.443 --> 16:54.237
No. Give me that.

16:54.445 --> 16:56.072
No comment!

16:56.280 --> 16:58.533
Oh, no, Daphne, please,
don't answer the phone.

16:58.699 --> 16:59.909
Let the machine pick up.

17:00.117 --> 17:02.411
Well, the machine's filled up.
Everyone's been calling.

17:02.620 --> 17:05.248
- Oh, God. Where's Frederick?
- He's still asleep.

17:05.455 --> 17:08.291
Look, Dr. Crane, I just want to say
you're the victim here.

17:08.459 --> 17:09.502
Thank you.

17:09.710 --> 17:11.170
American society's so close-minded

17:11.378 --> 17:13.339
when it comes
to sexual experimentation.

17:13.547 --> 17:16.050
- In Europe...
- Daphne, I didn't do anything wrong!

17:16.300 --> 17:18.386
Well, exactly.
That's what I'm trying to say.

17:18.551 --> 17:21.472
Oh, God, I guess I deserve all this.

17:21.638 --> 17:25.017
I certainly had enough warning
to stop being such a Boy Scout.

17:25.226 --> 17:27.811
But did I listen? No.

17:27.978 --> 17:30.481
Well, from now on, Dr. Crane,

17:30.648 --> 17:34.443
or as Seattle now knows him,
"Dr. Strangelove"...

17:36.821 --> 17:38.864
...is out of the Samaritan business.

17:39.073 --> 17:40.199
Thank you, Niles.

17:40.908 --> 17:44.787
Frasier, have you given much thought
to what you're going to tell Frederick?

17:45.996 --> 17:47.581
Oh, God.

17:48.165 --> 17:50.876
How can I possibly explain it to him?

17:51.251 --> 17:53.337
Well, I guess
the key is not to be evasive.

17:53.504 --> 17:55.464
He's gonna hear about it
sooner or later.

17:55.673 --> 17:58.884
I guess it should be from me.
After all, I am a trained professional.

17:59.093 --> 18:01.595
I'll be able to do it in a way
that won't traumatize the child.

18:01.762 --> 18:03.889
Freddie, don't touch that!

18:10.187 --> 18:12.147
You know,
I could use a glass of orange juice.

18:12.356 --> 18:14.399
I think I'm gonna go in the kitchen
and get a glass.

18:14.608 --> 18:18.070
Oh, orange juice. Yum.
I'm going to come with you for that.

18:20.113 --> 18:23.367
- Am I having another surprise party?
- No.

18:23.533 --> 18:26.995
No, Frederick, here,
sit down for a second, son.

18:27.204 --> 18:29.998
I've got something
I've got to talk to you about.

18:30.457 --> 18:31.625
For the next couple of days,

18:31.792 --> 18:34.711
you're gonna hear
some rather nasty stories

18:34.878 --> 18:38.799
and some snide jokes
about your old man.

18:39.049 --> 18:41.093
Mom's coming?

18:46.723 --> 18:49.601
No. No, no, she's not.

18:49.810 --> 18:50.852
It's...

18:51.061 --> 18:54.773
It's very hard for me to tell you this,
but I just spent the night in jail.

18:54.981 --> 18:57.275
Wow, like Brad Johnson's dad.

18:57.484 --> 19:00.904
Well, that was different.
Insider trading is wrong.

19:02.906 --> 19:04.574
- What did you do?
- Well,

19:04.824 --> 19:09.120
I saw a woman standing in the rain,
and I gave her a ride.

19:09.329 --> 19:11.081
You can go to jail for that?

19:11.331 --> 19:13.750
Well, it depends
on the sort of woman.

19:13.917 --> 19:15.168
You see, this particular woman,

19:15.335 --> 19:21.466
this person was a prostitute.

19:21.674 --> 19:24.344
But I didn't know that
until it was too late.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.179
A prostitute?

19:26.429 --> 19:29.349
Oh, God, how can I explain this?

19:30.350 --> 19:33.311
A prostitute is someone
who engages in sexual relations

19:33.520 --> 19:35.438
with other people for money.

19:35.688 --> 19:39.400
Dad, I'm 11.
I know what a prostitute is.

19:40.944 --> 19:43.821
But why did you pick one up?

19:44.447 --> 19:49.827
Well, you see, I didn't know
that it was a prostitute at the time.

19:50.036 --> 19:53.664
I was only trying to do a good deed.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.167
And I guess in hindsight,
it was all a big mistake.

19:56.375 --> 19:58.294
I just should have minded
my own business.

19:58.544 --> 20:02.215
So, what are you saying, Dad?
You shouldn't try to help people?

20:04.133 --> 20:05.843
Well...

20:19.315 --> 20:22.652
- May I offer you a ride?
- Oh, thank you.

20:27.907 --> 20:30.493
I waved at you a couple of times,
but I didn't think you saw me.

20:30.659 --> 20:31.744
Yes, well, I noticed you.

20:31.994 --> 20:35.331
I was just having
sort of a bad daydream.

20:35.915 --> 20:37.458
So where can I take you?

20:37.666 --> 20:39.752
Same place you're going.

20:40.002 --> 20:42.755
- Oh, dear God, you're...
- Laura Hilton.

20:43.005 --> 20:46.967
- I live in your building.
- Of course. Laura. Hi.

20:47.343 --> 20:49.303
I'm so glad you stopped
when you did.

20:49.511 --> 20:51.430
Oh, I'm certainly glad I stopped too.
