WEBVTT

01:08.260 --> 01:09.327
Oh, hi.

01:12.397 --> 01:13.733
Here we go.

01:22.274 --> 01:24.777
Uh...

01:24.811 --> 01:26.679
Sammi liked the yellow ones.

01:26.713 --> 01:29.949
Oh, they're not for my daughter,
they're for my wife.

01:29.982 --> 01:32.018
- I know.
- Keep the change.

02:48.661 --> 02:50.863
Surprise, my love!

02:56.535 --> 02:58.671
Ooh, hello, Charles.

02:58.704 --> 03:00.006
Hello, Charlie.

03:00.039 --> 03:01.641
What you doin'?

03:06.712 --> 03:08.580
Margaret...

03:08.613 --> 03:11.383
Don't be mad I'm playing poker
with the boys.

03:11.416 --> 03:14.086
I promise not to lose
too much... this time.

03:15.955 --> 03:17.089
Really, John?

03:17.123 --> 03:20.626
It's only a small game tonight.

03:20.660 --> 03:21.794
I promise.

03:21.828 --> 03:23.696
You are pure trouble!

03:23.729 --> 03:25.430
Margie, I'm no trouble.

03:25.463 --> 03:27.133
Trouble just follows me.

03:27.166 --> 03:30.870
I just... no, I just can't do this
anymore, Jonathan.

03:43.683 --> 03:47.653
Maybe if I got you that gift
you wanted, you'd forgive me.

03:47.687 --> 03:49.387
What's that?

03:54.126 --> 03:56.428
Theater tickets
for Thursday night.

03:58.463 --> 03:59.866
Come on, Marge.

03:59.899 --> 04:02.467
You know you're
everything to me.

04:02.500 --> 04:05.037
Oh, I know.

04:12.510 --> 04:13.946
Oh, sorry.

04:21.519 --> 04:22.822
Thank you.

04:26.893 --> 04:28.460
Ah.

04:28.493 --> 04:31.197
You know I'd be lost
without you.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.965
I know.

05:59.685 --> 06:01.787
Without anyone checking on them,

06:01.821 --> 06:04.223
cops can do whatever
the hell they want.

06:04.256 --> 06:06.591
Drugs, rape, murder.

06:06.624 --> 06:08.194
Yeah, well, I'm not buying it.

06:08.227 --> 06:10.129
Any case,
how could you prove it?

06:10.162 --> 06:12.732
- The police public records.
- What about 'em?

06:12.765 --> 06:15.533
The records have
all the shit they do.

06:15.567 --> 06:18.070
Imagine what would happen
if they were published.

06:19.105 --> 06:21.841
- Yes! Thank you!
- Oh my God, are you kidding me?

06:22.875 --> 06:24.609
Thank you! Good night!

06:24.643 --> 06:27.179
- Come to me. Lucky Chucky.
- Come on.

06:27.213 --> 06:29.248
- Thank you, miss.
- Lucky Chucky!

06:29.281 --> 06:30.816
- Not one good hand.
- You're quitting?

06:30.850 --> 06:33.152
I would've probably lost my ass
on the next hand.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.720
- Señor John.
- Hola.

06:34.754 --> 06:36.689
- Hey, Mike.
- ¿Cómo está, Mike?

06:36.722 --> 06:38.257
- Bad hand, huh?
- Well, not as bad

06:38.290 --> 06:40.159
as the handjob
you gave me last night.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.194
- Oh, hello!
- Hey, easy, easy!

06:42.228 --> 06:44.230
You pay me
for my professional services,

06:44.263 --> 06:45.831
but not that type of service.

06:45.865 --> 06:47.666
He used to be good at it.

06:47.700 --> 06:48.834
Let me know what you think.

06:48.868 --> 06:50.602
Spanish translation's
in the back.

06:50.636 --> 06:51.837
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers.

06:51.871 --> 06:53.906
Listen to this, Chuck.

06:53.939 --> 06:56.342
"Libre Post is
an intriguing look

06:56.375 --> 06:58.978
into law enforcement
in Suray County.

06:59.011 --> 07:03.581
A real eye-opener about the side
not reported elsewhere.

07:03.615 --> 07:06.185
How do some officers
get wrapped up in it all

07:06.218 --> 07:08.586
and cross that thin blue line?

07:08.620 --> 07:11.123
Join us for this journey
into the world

07:11.157 --> 07:13.826
of those whose job is
to protect and serve

07:13.859 --> 07:16.996
but instead are here
to deflect and swerve."

07:17.029 --> 07:18.831
- Oh, that's nice.
- You like it, huh?

07:18.864 --> 07:20.733
- You wrote that?
- Yeah, I did.

07:20.766 --> 07:22.201
- I wrote that.
- He didn't write that.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.070
Well, I helped!

07:24.103 --> 07:27.106
I'm gonna be the chief,
uh, chief...

07:27.139 --> 07:29.607
- Editor, chief editor.
- Yeah.

07:30.608 --> 07:32.812
Hey, when did you downgrade
to journalist

07:32.845 --> 07:34.113
in your family's own paper?

07:34.146 --> 07:37.383
Investigative journalist,
I might add.

07:37.416 --> 07:41.153
Chief Collins
is gonna shit her pants.

07:42.354 --> 07:44.023
Yeah, she is,

07:44.056 --> 07:46.292
and what happens
if the cops come after you?

07:47.326 --> 07:50.296
Well, I'll have to go
after them even harder.

07:50.329 --> 07:53.065
I'm not gonna sit with
my arms crossed doing nothing

07:53.099 --> 07:55.267
after they broke into my house.

07:55.301 --> 07:57.269
So, we print?

07:58.404 --> 08:00.806
Run the presses.

08:00.840 --> 08:02.041
Could you give that
to the bartender?

08:02.074 --> 08:04.176
- I know it's not much, but...
- Good night, I'm done.

08:04.210 --> 08:05.411
- Thanks, guys.
- See ya.

08:05.444 --> 08:06.879
Have a good one.

08:06.912 --> 08:08.347
All right.

08:08.380 --> 08:10.349
Stack 'em up,
you got a nickel left.

08:10.382 --> 08:11.784
Let's do it.

08:14.086 --> 08:17.289
Good morning, Sedcott, it's
Monday, September 20th, 2005.

08:17.323 --> 08:18.924
It's gonna be so hot today,

08:18.958 --> 08:22.261
you might as well apply
for a job inside the mines.

08:22.294 --> 08:26.265
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
the rumor is true.

08:26.298 --> 08:30.136
Our newspaper tycoon
is back at it.

08:31.237 --> 08:34.173
Most people who feel
they were wronged by the police

08:34.206 --> 08:36.008
file a complaint.

08:36.041 --> 08:38.978
John Wilson started a newspaper.

08:39.011 --> 08:42.014
His first edition attacks
the excessive use of force

08:42.047 --> 08:44.016
from the Immigration
and Drug Unit,

08:44.049 --> 08:47.353
which attempts to fight
Arizona's drug problem.

08:47.386 --> 08:49.155
But according to John's paper,

08:49.188 --> 08:52.224
the Immigration and Drug Unit
is using its power

08:52.258 --> 08:55.094
to profile undocumented
immigrant workers.

08:55.127 --> 08:56.929
Turn around!

08:56.962 --> 08:59.431
The paper goes on to blame
the excessive use of power

08:59.465 --> 09:02.201
on your very own Chief Collins.

09:04.236 --> 09:06.972
Ever since taking over
his family's company,

09:07.006 --> 09:09.475
Mr. Wilson has published
articles in the past

09:09.508 --> 09:12.144
attacking police,
but this goes a step further

09:12.178 --> 09:16.448
by publishing stories using
the police's own public records

09:16.482 --> 09:18.918
to expose cases
where the police

09:18.951 --> 09:22.154
have allegedly abused
their power.

09:22.188 --> 09:24.156
Ponder that for just a moment.

09:24.190 --> 09:26.859
We'll be back
after these messages.

11:23.208 --> 11:24.310
Help.

11:26.111 --> 11:27.613
Unit 205 to dispatch.

11:27.647 --> 11:28.981
I got a 10-52.

11:29.014 --> 11:31.083
I need medics and backup
for traffic control.

11:31.116 --> 11:32.851
10-4, copy request for medic.

11:38.424 --> 11:40.392
Hey, what do you need?

11:40.426 --> 11:42.261
Block the road!

11:42.294 --> 11:44.596
Hey, you're new, aren't you?

11:44.631 --> 11:47.066
We don't say,
"Block the road," man.

11:47.099 --> 11:47.933
Got it.

11:47.966 --> 11:50.135
Well, where the fuck
do you want me?

11:50.169 --> 11:51.370
Back here behind me.

11:51.403 --> 11:54.106
Right, I'm gonna pull forward
for a second, here we go.

12:05.918 --> 12:07.586
Shit.

12:12.391 --> 12:13.892
Hey, get the fuck back from me!

12:13.926 --> 12:16.362
- What's going on?
- Stay there, stay back!

12:21.166 --> 12:23.135
Oh, goddamn it.

12:27.239 --> 12:29.108
He was already dead, right?

12:29.141 --> 12:30.476
Right?

13:51.791 --> 13:55.260
Congratulations on being named
Chief of the Year.

13:55.294 --> 13:57.095
Would you like to attend
the gala?

13:57.129 --> 13:59.766
Of course,
I'd be glad to attend!

13:59.799 --> 14:02.134
You know I can never say no
to those things.

14:02.167 --> 14:05.137
It's always an honor
to represent this fine town.

14:05.170 --> 14:07.272
Thank you for your service,
Chief Collins.

14:07.306 --> 14:09.274
Thank you, Governor Rice.

14:14.079 --> 14:16.415
What do I always say
to you boys?

14:16.448 --> 14:18.484
Proudest chief in the state.

14:18.517 --> 14:20.085
Congratulations, Chief.

14:20.118 --> 14:21.520
Damn right, congratulations.

14:21.553 --> 14:24.289
We earned that
through hard work,

14:24.323 --> 14:27.459
which brings me
to the both of you.

14:29.629 --> 14:31.597
I only ask for two things:

14:31.631 --> 14:34.600
illegals and drug smugglers.

14:34.634 --> 14:36.568
That's it.

14:36.602 --> 14:40.339
And you two... bring me this.

14:43.442 --> 14:45.344
Okay, boys.

14:45.377 --> 14:47.112
Talk.

14:47.145 --> 14:49.649
He... was dead

14:49.682 --> 14:51.651
before we got there.

14:54.553 --> 14:56.789
Deputy Johnson?

15:00.526 --> 15:04.631
When I got there and checked the
body, I couldn't find a pulse.

15:04.664 --> 15:07.767
He died from the first impact.

15:09.167 --> 15:10.637
Very well.

15:10.670 --> 15:13.438
If that's the case, I will clear
that up in the report,

15:13.472 --> 15:15.440
but I'm assigning you two
to find and arrest

15:15.474 --> 15:16.776
the runaway driver.

15:16.809 --> 15:19.746
Deputy Johnson, welcome to town.

15:19.779 --> 15:22.614
I hope this incident prepares
you for what lies ahead.

15:22.649 --> 15:23.482
Yes, ma'am.

15:23.515 --> 15:26.151
Just remember we're
a border town.

15:26.184 --> 15:28.153
Look for drug smugglers
or illegals.

15:28.186 --> 15:30.255
Can't find one,
look for the other.

15:30.289 --> 15:31.590
Understood.

15:35.460 --> 15:37.563
Have you seen this?

15:42.702 --> 15:44.637
Who published this shit?

15:44.671 --> 15:46.405
John Wilson.

15:47.539 --> 15:48.875
He's making us look corrupt,

15:48.908 --> 15:51.243
and he's publishing
our officers' names.

15:51.276 --> 15:55.280
Pearl, no, he's doing this
because we raided his house.

15:55.314 --> 15:59.418
That's County Attorney Park
to you, officer.

15:59.451 --> 16:01.420
You never told me
we didn't have a warrant.

16:01.453 --> 16:03.355
We had an anonymous tip.

16:03.388 --> 16:05.792
My cops went in
under the raid program.

16:05.825 --> 16:07.426
The judge approved it.

16:07.459 --> 16:11.363
Did we find drugs in his house?

16:11.396 --> 16:13.231
No.

16:14.767 --> 16:17.436
Boys, out.

16:27.814 --> 16:32.117
So, what do you think
of your new office?

16:33.485 --> 16:35.187
Looks good.

16:35.220 --> 16:37.657
Just hope I don't fuck this up.

16:37.690 --> 16:41.226
It'll be fine, and Diana
is an excellent journalist.

16:41.259 --> 16:44.463
She didn't mind transferring
down from our other paper?

16:44.496 --> 16:46.733
She was so happy,
she offered to work for less

16:46.766 --> 16:49.167
if we promised not to give her
more sports assignments.

16:58.610 --> 17:00.312
Let's go outside.

17:00.345 --> 17:01.613
Okay?

17:10.657 --> 17:11.791
You all right?

17:11.824 --> 17:13.726
Oh, yeah.

17:15.494 --> 17:18.363
Ooh.

17:18.397 --> 17:20.733
You remember when we were kids?

17:20.767 --> 17:24.536
Yeah, this town was filled
with good memories,

17:24.569 --> 17:27.874
and some not so good.

17:27.907 --> 17:30.442
Like the one time
you got arrested for, uh,

17:30.475 --> 17:32.511
water-skiing naked on the lake.

17:35.815 --> 17:38.818
Well, I still want to know
who called the cops on me.

17:38.851 --> 17:40.753
Probably half the town.

17:44.891 --> 17:46.224
Everything okay?

17:46.258 --> 17:47.126
Yeah.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.895
I just came back
from Matt's office,

17:48.928 --> 17:50.295
he says there's nothing new.

17:50.328 --> 17:52.865
I don't know, maybe it's just...

17:52.899 --> 17:54.466
allergies or something.

17:57.436 --> 17:59.371
You know what's coming up,
right?

17:59.404 --> 18:01.440
What?

18:01.473 --> 18:02.809
Sammi's birthday.

18:06.445 --> 18:08.981
Yeah, I know, I know.

18:11.651 --> 18:13.720
You're a good father, John.

18:13.753 --> 18:16.354
I'm sure she's
gonna turn around.

18:16.388 --> 18:18.925
Last time I called her,
her number was out of service.

18:18.958 --> 18:20.793
I think she blocked my number.

18:20.827 --> 18:23.528
- Let's try it again.
- No, no, buddy.

18:23.562 --> 18:26.032
We're just at a stalemate,
that's all.

18:26.065 --> 18:30.469
She still blames me
for her mother's...

18:30.502 --> 18:32.537
addictions

18:32.571 --> 18:33.371
and death.

18:33.405 --> 18:35.875
Well, you know
that is not your fault.

18:35.908 --> 18:38.010
- You tried.
- I know.

18:38.044 --> 18:39.779
John?

18:39.812 --> 18:41.413
Yeah?

18:41.446 --> 18:42.414
Coming.

18:42.447 --> 18:44.616
Hey, you have a sec?

18:44.650 --> 18:45.952
- Sure.
- Okay.

18:45.985 --> 18:47.619
Uh, I gotta go to a meeting,

18:47.653 --> 18:49.321
but I will talk
to you guys later.

18:49.354 --> 18:50.555
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:50.589 --> 18:52.725
So, how's the paper doing?

18:52.759 --> 18:54.326
Well, people are calling.

18:54.359 --> 18:56.294
Some like it, some hate it,

18:56.328 --> 18:57.596
but the town is hooked.

18:57.630 --> 18:59.899
Good, good,
'cause I wanted to talk to you

18:59.932 --> 19:02.802
about how long I'm gonna keep
this special edition going.

19:02.835 --> 19:04.003
- Sure.
- Yeah.

19:04.036 --> 19:05.838
But first you have to hear this.

19:05.872 --> 19:07.606
What?

19:07.640 --> 19:09.742
We have a new story.

19:23.122 --> 19:25.357
They didn't put anything
on the road.

19:25.390 --> 19:27.459
No cones, no tapes.

19:34.667 --> 19:38.370
They left his body out for five
hours without doing anything.

19:48.648 --> 19:50.950
They didn't kill a dog.

19:50.983 --> 19:53.618
They killed his son.

19:54.854 --> 19:55.788
I'm sorry.

19:55.822 --> 19:58.090
John, here's some
of the pictures we got

19:58.124 --> 19:59.091
from the night.

20:02.394 --> 20:04.529
Some of the workers
who saw the first driver

20:04.563 --> 20:06.666
said that it was
an older truck.

20:10.670 --> 20:13.139
The ones who saw the drivers
are afraid to speak.

20:15.908 --> 20:18.376
Who was the cop who ran over...

20:18.410 --> 20:20.046
We don't have their names.

20:20.079 --> 20:22.014
Well, where are
the police records?

20:22.048 --> 20:23.850
Chief Collins
won't release them.

20:23.883 --> 20:25.852
Actually, the police told me
they won't be releasing

20:25.885 --> 20:27.019
any more records.

20:39.832 --> 20:41.834
Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson,
you need an appointment!

20:41.868 --> 20:43.135
- Stop!
- You can't come through here.

20:43.169 --> 20:44.804
Is Chief Collins
in the office?

20:44.837 --> 20:46.504
I have to speak to her
about something.

20:46.538 --> 20:47.572
Not without an appointment.

20:47.606 --> 20:50.776
I'm not leaving here
until I talk to the chief.

20:50.810 --> 20:52.945
- Boys.
- Yes, ma'am.

20:52.979 --> 20:54.747
Let him come.

20:57.683 --> 20:59.051
Thank you.

21:03.723 --> 21:07.193
My journalists have the right
to the Olivares records.

21:07.226 --> 21:09.561
Those records contain
classified information

21:09.594 --> 21:11.664
that can't be released.

21:11.697 --> 21:12.665
Classified?

21:13.766 --> 21:15.067
What is this, the FBI?

21:16.836 --> 21:18.804
Have a seat, John.

21:22.041 --> 21:24.542
Let's make one thing clear.

21:24.576 --> 21:27.179
My officers are not corrupt.

21:27.213 --> 21:28.381
Stop all this nonsense.

21:28.413 --> 21:31.483
Who are the officers involved
in the Olivares incident?

21:31.516 --> 21:33.618
We're looking for the driver
who ran over the man.

21:33.653 --> 21:35.988
Wasn't there a second driver
who also ran over the man,

21:36.022 --> 21:38.925
and wasn't that second driver
one of your officers?

21:40.259 --> 21:42.560
I will be making
a public statement

21:42.594 --> 21:44.630
as soon as we have
all of the facts.

21:44.664 --> 21:47.833
The public has a right
to have the facts now.

21:50.903 --> 21:52.672
What are you hiding
in those records?

21:52.705 --> 21:54.774
Oh, thanks for stopping by,
John.

21:54.807 --> 21:56.909
Who are you protecting?

21:59.712 --> 22:01.546
Listen carefully,

22:01.579 --> 22:06.018
you worthless, sour,
narcissistic son of a bitch.

22:06.052 --> 22:08.688
You mess with my men,
I will destroy

22:08.721 --> 22:10.957
that paper of yours,
and I will not stop

22:10.990 --> 22:13.659
until everyone in this state
knows not to publish

22:13.693 --> 22:18.030
as much as a comma
in any rag of yours ever again.

22:19.165 --> 22:22.969
Now you listen to me,
you sour daughter of a bastard.

22:23.002 --> 22:25.503
This is America, goddamn it.

22:25.537 --> 22:28.908
We have the right to free press.

22:28.941 --> 22:33.578
And you can't stop us
from publishing those records.

22:33.611 --> 22:36.015
I will get those records.

22:49.962 --> 22:52.164
Chicago, eh?

22:52.198 --> 22:53.866
Yeah, born and raised.

22:53.899 --> 22:58.170
Did you, uh, did you get tired
of the snow or what?

22:58.204 --> 23:01.140
Nah, I just wanted
some fresh air, actually.

23:03.709 --> 23:05.811
- Fresh air?
- Yeah.

23:05.845 --> 23:09.081
Oh, dude, there's nothing fresh
about this place, man.

23:09.115 --> 23:12.617
The heat just, like,
rots everything around here.

23:15.321 --> 23:19.557
I can already tell
you're gonna fit in just right.

23:20.192 --> 23:22.128
Hey, look,

23:22.161 --> 23:23.561
see right up there?

23:23.595 --> 23:25.031
Hmm?

23:25.064 --> 23:27.666
That's John Wilson's newspaper.

23:27.700 --> 23:29.601
Why'd he start that newspaper?

23:29.635 --> 23:31.804
To shame cops.

23:31.837 --> 23:33.571
Yeah, but most of the stories

23:33.605 --> 23:36.876
come straight from
public records though, right?

23:36.909 --> 23:38.677
Kidding me, right?

23:38.711 --> 23:40.612
I mean, you've read the paper.

23:40.646 --> 23:42.848
No, I just heard about it.

23:42.882 --> 23:44.582
All right, well, listen,

23:44.616 --> 23:47.787
I wouldn't give my attention
to an opportunist.

23:47.820 --> 23:49.587
What does that mean?

23:49.621 --> 23:54.326
It means, just wait
till he writes about you, man.

23:54.360 --> 23:57.263
He'll make money defaming you.

23:57.296 --> 23:59.932
It's what he's been doing
with me and other cops

23:59.965 --> 24:02.768
in this area for years, man.

24:02.802 --> 24:04.336
Shit.

24:06.972 --> 24:09.108
People in this town,

24:09.141 --> 24:11.377
they don't play nice, Ricky.

24:11.410 --> 24:13.045
You gotta learn to play dirty

24:13.079 --> 24:15.281
if you wanna get ahead
in Sedcott.

24:18.684 --> 24:20.753
Two outs and a runner on...

24:30.396 --> 24:31.797
I'm leaving.

24:31.831 --> 24:33.265
Gotta get home.

25:16.142 --> 25:17.810
Honey, are you okay?

25:19.311 --> 25:20.679
John?

25:23.082 --> 25:26.886
Oh, thank you.

25:26.919 --> 25:28.888
I don't think this thing works.

25:30.923 --> 25:34.059
Go get the old one,
it's downstairs.

26:52.404 --> 26:54.306
Kidding me?

27:11.824 --> 27:13.859
I'm not sure about
this John Wilson guy.

27:13.892 --> 27:16.495
He acts like such a big-shot
with all his family newspapers,

27:16.528 --> 27:18.297
but according
to the other papers in town,

27:18.330 --> 27:19.798
he's just making it all up.

27:19.832 --> 27:21.200
He's had a run-in with the cops.

27:21.233 --> 27:22.801
That was Brett from Yuma.

27:22.835 --> 27:23.836
Thanks for calling in.

27:23.869 --> 27:25.204
So, how about it, Sedcott?

27:25.237 --> 27:26.438
Any truth to this?

27:26.472 --> 27:29.275
Does John have some kind of
personal interest in all this,

27:29.308 --> 27:30.476
some vendetta?

27:30.509 --> 27:34.013
Call us, tell us what you think.
KTNP AM 1660.

28:12.384 --> 28:13.419
Yeah, it's them.

28:13.452 --> 28:15.487
Shut the engine off, huh?

28:21.093 --> 28:24.563
I can't believe all the crap
the other papers are writing.

28:24.596 --> 28:27.399
Why can't we just write
an article about all these lies?

28:27.433 --> 28:30.102
If we get sidetracked, we're not
gonna win the Olivares case.

28:30.135 --> 28:31.638
I agree.

28:31.671 --> 28:34.907
Also, I'm concerned
about our delivery crew.

28:34.940 --> 28:36.875
Cops are harassing them,
and some of them

28:36.909 --> 28:39.278
are refusing to work.

28:40.946 --> 28:42.481
Jesus.

28:42.514 --> 28:44.116
What the hell?

28:46.051 --> 28:47.019
Stay back.

28:50.289 --> 28:51.390
Look at this.

28:52.424 --> 28:53.525
Look at this.

30:04.697 --> 30:06.699
Any progress?

30:06.733 --> 30:07.767
Not much.

30:07.801 --> 30:10.402
We walked all over the place,
we found nothing.

30:10.436 --> 30:12.104
How about witnesses?

30:12.137 --> 30:14.106
There were two miners, but...

30:14.139 --> 30:15.107
But?

30:15.140 --> 30:17.242
They seem to have disappeared.

30:17.276 --> 30:19.712
For God's sake, find them.

30:19.746 --> 30:22.114
Hey!

30:22.147 --> 30:22.948
What is it?

30:22.981 --> 30:24.684
Looks like they left
a clue behind.

30:24.717 --> 30:26.653
- What the hell is that?
- It's a mirror.

30:26.686 --> 30:28.520
Could be part
of the suspect's vehicle,

30:28.554 --> 30:30.289
found not too far away.

30:30.322 --> 30:32.324
Seriously?

30:32.357 --> 30:34.993
We need those witnesses.

30:35.027 --> 30:37.262
Find me those witnesses.

30:38.030 --> 30:39.531
Yeah, Chief.

30:43.268 --> 30:45.404
Where'd you find it?

30:45.437 --> 30:47.539
The bush over there.

30:51.243 --> 30:52.679
This is a waste of time.

30:52.712 --> 30:55.715
Come on,
I want to show you something.

30:59.752 --> 31:01.721
In the old days,
editors would have spikes

31:01.754 --> 31:04.556
on their desks, and this is
where they would put stories

31:04.590 --> 31:06.291
that were withheld
for publication

31:06.325 --> 31:08.494
for reasons of lack
of veracity, clarity,

31:08.527 --> 31:10.562
sometimes even censorship.

31:10.596 --> 31:13.432
The stories we're publishing
at Libre Post tell the truth

31:13.465 --> 31:15.802
about the police's
excessive use of force.

31:15.835 --> 31:18.671
The problem is
that someone out there

31:18.705 --> 31:21.641
is trying to spike
our entire newspaper,

31:21.674 --> 31:23.743
and it's not just the police.

31:23.776 --> 31:27.179
Somebody out there
is making threats.

31:27.212 --> 31:29.181
That's why you want
the police records?

31:29.214 --> 31:31.183
Libre Post relies
on these records.

31:31.216 --> 31:32.819
Without them,
all we have is, what?

31:32.852 --> 31:33.953
It's pure commentary.

31:33.987 --> 31:36.588
Why can't we just file
a Freedom of Information Act

31:36.622 --> 31:37.757
and get them?

31:37.790 --> 31:40.359
They can withhold them
if there's sensitive information

31:40.392 --> 31:44.396
about a case, or personal
identifying information

31:44.429 --> 31:46.064
of the victims or officers.

31:46.098 --> 31:48.133
To hell with that.

31:48.166 --> 31:50.770
Even if they agree to release
some of the records,

31:50.803 --> 31:52.571
they have the power
to redact them,

31:52.604 --> 31:55.541
edit, erase,
reorder the documents

31:55.574 --> 31:57.810
to protect
this sensitive information.

31:59.344 --> 32:00.713
What if we sue?

32:00.747 --> 32:03.215
You're the lawyer, Peter,
you tell me.

32:06.151 --> 32:07.319
What?

32:08.487 --> 32:09.722
To have a strong case,

32:09.756 --> 32:11.791
we could use
the Olivares incident to prove

32:11.824 --> 32:14.626
how releasing the records
can help solve crime.

32:14.661 --> 32:17.195
- Go on.
- We need witnesses.

32:17.229 --> 32:19.666
If they testify
against the police,

32:19.699 --> 32:21.668
the judge may have
to release the records.

32:21.701 --> 32:24.169
However, you do need to consider

32:24.202 --> 32:27.172
that you're putting you
and your paper on the line,

32:27.205 --> 32:28.775
and it's not just Libre Post.

32:28.808 --> 32:31.510
All your other publications
may take a hit.

32:32.544 --> 32:33.646
What are they gonna do?

32:33.680 --> 32:34.881
Put us out of business?

32:34.914 --> 32:36.849
They can drain you out of money
with lawsuits.

32:38.918 --> 32:40.653
John, if we don't get
the records,

32:40.687 --> 32:42.554
there's no need
to keep Libre Post open.

32:45.624 --> 32:48.594
Hang on a second,
we gotta think about this.

32:48.628 --> 32:50.228
Think about what?

32:50.262 --> 32:51.764
This is an investigative paper.

32:51.798 --> 32:54.701
We investigate,
we uncover the truth.

32:54.734 --> 32:56.769
That's what I thought
we were doing.

32:56.803 --> 32:58.570
That's what we're doing,

32:58.604 --> 33:00.238
but I gotta...

33:00.272 --> 33:01.874
This is my family's business.

33:01.908 --> 33:04.176
I can't just put everything
that my father,

33:04.209 --> 33:06.311
my grandfather built
on the line,

33:06.345 --> 33:08.347
and all your jobs too.

33:08.380 --> 33:10.883
Think about it.

33:23.830 --> 33:25.564
This,

33:25.597 --> 33:28.868
this is where I really need you.

33:28.901 --> 33:30.770
It's a lot of money.

33:30.803 --> 33:33.305
Mm-hmm.

33:33.338 --> 33:35.307
Drug smuggling, hey.

33:36.643 --> 33:39.211
It's where the real war is.

33:39.244 --> 33:41.313
And a lot of cops,

33:41.346 --> 33:44.249
they die every year
for this shit.

33:44.282 --> 33:47.552
I'm sure that's why
Chief Collins is so strict.

33:47.586 --> 33:49.521
You could say that.

33:52.257 --> 33:54.593
What exactly happened
in Chicago?

33:54.626 --> 33:58.831
I heard that you
and some other cops got busted.

34:01.768 --> 34:03.970
Whatever happened back then

34:04.003 --> 34:06.673
happened a long time ago,

34:06.706 --> 34:08.340
and I was cleared.

34:09.842 --> 34:11.576
Well, hey, man,

34:11.610 --> 34:14.246
you don't have
to apologize here.

34:14.279 --> 34:15.715
We're partners.

34:15.748 --> 34:18.818
All I'm saying is I had nothing
to do with that scheme.

34:18.851 --> 34:21.553
All I'm saying is
I wouldn't want

34:21.586 --> 34:24.556
that kind of publicity
around here, you know?

34:26.558 --> 34:28.527
I got nothing to hide.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.997
I'm sure you don't.

34:31.030 --> 34:33.966
I just wouldn't want
a certain... friend of ours

34:34.000 --> 34:36.368
getting his hands
on that type of information,

34:36.401 --> 34:39.005
if you know what I mean.

34:39.038 --> 34:42.008
Don't worry.

34:42.041 --> 34:45.678
You watch my back,

34:45.712 --> 34:48.246
I'll watch yours.

34:49.749 --> 34:51.651
Remember.

35:01.694 --> 35:03.528
John Wilson and the Sedcott DA

35:03.562 --> 35:05.865
will be squaring off in court
in the coming days.

35:05.898 --> 35:09.736
Wilson is challenging the DA
for access to public records,

35:09.769 --> 35:12.571
and, boy, does this have
the town talking.

35:12.604 --> 35:14.040
Hey, we have Caroline
on the line.

35:14.073 --> 35:15.041
What do you think?

35:15.074 --> 35:16.943
I think John Wilson's right.

35:16.976 --> 35:19.444
If the police can keep
these things from us,

35:19.478 --> 35:20.646
what else are they hiding?

35:20.680 --> 35:21.714
Thanks for calling in,

35:21.748 --> 35:23.615
and you're right
to be concerned.

35:23.649 --> 35:25.417
Think on that for just a moment.

35:25.450 --> 35:28.654
We'll be back in two minutes.

35:28.688 --> 35:31.057
Well, let's... yeah,
let's talk to Jose tomorrow.

35:31.090 --> 35:34.927
I'm sure he can help us
get the witnesses we need.

35:34.961 --> 35:36.763
Should we bring Mike with us?

35:36.796 --> 35:39.665
No, I think it's better
if it's just you and I.

35:39.699 --> 35:41.667
We don't want to overwhelm him,
you know what I mean?

35:41.701 --> 35:43.035
- Yeah, you're right.
- Yeah.

35:43.069 --> 35:44.904
- Okay, sounds good, I'm excited.
- Yeah, yeah.

35:44.937 --> 35:47.940
You're not gonna regret this.

35:49.642 --> 35:50.843
Is everything okay?

35:50.877 --> 35:52.712
Dinner's ready.

35:52.745 --> 35:54.579
Diana, um, uh,

35:54.613 --> 35:57.315
I will finish this call
tomorrow, okay?

35:57.349 --> 36:00.318
I gotta go, dinner's ready.

36:02.722 --> 36:04.023
What's the matter with you?

36:04.056 --> 36:05.792
Well,
you're getting hooked again.

36:05.825 --> 36:07.392
If we get the witnesses,

36:07.425 --> 36:09.829
there's not gonna be
any problem at trial.

36:09.862 --> 36:11.731
It's gonna be a breeze!

36:11.764 --> 36:13.565
You're retired.

36:13.598 --> 36:14.934
Do you remember that?

36:14.967 --> 36:17.003
You're retired,
and you've been doing nothing

36:17.036 --> 36:19.105
but working
on this stupid paper.

36:19.138 --> 36:21.707
The only thing you're doing
is stirring up trouble,

36:21.741 --> 36:22.742
like always.

36:22.775 --> 36:25.978
My family's worked on newspapers
for generations.

36:26.012 --> 36:28.446
My father did a lot of good
helping people.

36:28.480 --> 36:29.882
I'm trying to do the same.

36:34.887 --> 36:36.856
Stupid paper.

37:03.916 --> 37:05.685
Look who it is.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.922
Just, you know, keep it simple.

37:09.956 --> 37:12.624
You don't need to talk too much.
Let's just...

37:12.658 --> 37:14.459
Are you trying to raid
my car too?

37:14.492 --> 37:15.493
Is that what's going on?

37:15.527 --> 37:16.762
Immigration and Drug checkpoint.

37:16.796 --> 37:17.797
Turn the engine off.

37:18.898 --> 37:23.069
You know, you guys messed
with the wrong cowboy.

37:23.102 --> 37:25.738
You're gonna pay for what you
and the other officers did,

37:25.771 --> 37:27.974
breaking into my house
illegally.

37:28.007 --> 37:30.508
Okay, sure, old man.
Here you go.

37:33.511 --> 37:34.579
Come on.

37:37.216 --> 37:39.018
Here you go.

37:40.887 --> 37:42.487
Let's go this way.

37:44.123 --> 37:46.625
I need you to step
out of the car, please.

37:46.659 --> 37:48.027
Uh, I don't believe
you're allowed

37:48.060 --> 37:50.096
to, uh, go in my car like that.

37:50.129 --> 37:50.997
Yes, I am, sir.

37:51.030 --> 37:53.032
- Out of the car, please.
- Are you serious?

37:53.065 --> 37:54.033
- Yeah.
- For what?

37:54.066 --> 37:56.202
My dog smelled something,
I gotta check you.

37:56.235 --> 37:58.738
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh, come on.

37:58.771 --> 38:00.106
Out, please.

38:00.139 --> 38:01.506
Sit.

38:01.539 --> 38:03.508
You have to be kidding me.

38:04.944 --> 38:06.913
Put your hands on the window,
please.

38:06.946 --> 38:07.813
Hands right here.

38:07.847 --> 38:09.849
Let's go,
hands right here, please.

38:09.882 --> 38:11.583
Spread your legs open, please.

38:11.616 --> 38:13.185
Here you go, smell, smell.

38:18.623 --> 38:19.557
You enjoying that?

38:19.591 --> 38:21.827
Yeah, it's one of the perks
of the job.

38:21.861 --> 38:24.030
Oh, hey,
you wanna check her too?

38:24.063 --> 38:25.031
- Leave her alone.
- John, it's okay.

38:25.064 --> 38:26.966
- Out of the car, please.
- It's gonna be quick.

38:26.999 --> 38:28.801
Out of the car, please.
Check her, please.

38:28.834 --> 38:31.804
Ask her if she's got a passport
that she can show you.

38:31.837 --> 38:33.673
- I got a driver's license.
- Oh, you do?

38:33.706 --> 38:35.607
- She's an American citizen.
- Is she?

38:35.641 --> 38:38.010
- Yeah.
- Show 'em to him, please.

38:38.044 --> 38:39.611
Show him.

38:43.615 --> 38:45.617
- How is it?
- We're good.

38:45.651 --> 38:47.720
Okay, you're good.

38:47.753 --> 38:49.789
Get back in your car.

38:49.822 --> 38:53.926
You can go back
to shaming cops now.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.629
I only write about cops
who shoot people

38:56.662 --> 38:59.231
fives times after they're
already on the ground.

38:59.265 --> 39:00.565
That guy threatened me.

39:00.598 --> 39:03.135
Yeah, he threw a rock at you,
a rock?

39:03.169 --> 39:05.805
You know what,
all your stupid articles

39:05.838 --> 39:08.874
and now this paper
is making me lose my patience.

39:08.908 --> 39:11.243
Why don't you stop trying
to be a fucking hero,

39:11.277 --> 39:12.745
'cause the whole town,

39:12.778 --> 39:14.747
this whole town knows
that you're not.

39:14.780 --> 39:16.649
I'm not gonna stop
until people know

39:16.682 --> 39:18.918
the kind of officers
we have in this town.

39:20.686 --> 39:23.823
Man, you don't know anything,
old man.

39:23.856 --> 39:24.924
- Oh yeah?
- Uh-huh.

39:24.957 --> 39:26.292
You take that gun girdle off

39:26.325 --> 39:28.560
and I'll show you
what an old man can do.

39:28.593 --> 39:30.229
- John, let's go.
- Huh?

39:30.262 --> 39:32.732
- Get back in the car, please.
- Let's go.

39:32.765 --> 39:34.166
Get back in the car, please.

39:37.269 --> 39:39.571
You know what you are?

39:39.604 --> 39:40.773
You're just a fool.

39:40.806 --> 39:42.675
You don't know anything.

39:42.708 --> 39:43.943
Mind your own business.

39:46.145 --> 39:47.680
Stay out of this.

39:49.215 --> 39:50.850
Let's go.

39:50.883 --> 39:53.719
What took you so long
to call me back?

39:53.753 --> 39:56.856
I've been busy at the mine.
What's up?

39:56.889 --> 39:59.624
What's up is I have a problem
and you're gonna fix it.

40:00.860 --> 40:04.330
John is not just your problem,
Margaret.

40:04.363 --> 40:07.767
Come over tomorrow
and we can talk about it.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.702
That sounds good.

40:09.735 --> 40:11.103
We might have
to speed things up

40:11.137 --> 40:13.873
to get him
to stop digging around.

40:13.906 --> 40:16.709
He's driving me crazy
with all this newspaper crap.

40:16.742 --> 40:17.943
All right.

40:17.977 --> 40:19.645
All the girls hate me
at the club.

40:19.678 --> 40:20.980
I can't even go to the salon

40:21.013 --> 40:23.082
without everybody talking
about it.

40:24.183 --> 40:25.251
Whatever, Margaret.

40:25.284 --> 40:27.053
I gotta go.

40:27.086 --> 40:29.155
Okay, bye.

41:00.719 --> 41:02.788
Hola, Luis.

41:02.822 --> 41:04.090
- Hello.
- This is John.

41:04.123 --> 41:06.591
- Hi.
- How you doin'?

41:07.960 --> 41:09.662
We need to talk
to your grandpa.

41:09.695 --> 41:12.798
Okay, okay, yeah,
I'll tell him.

41:15.868 --> 41:17.069
Hey, you okay?

41:17.103 --> 41:19.905
Ah, yeah, no, I'm fine.

41:28.981 --> 41:30.182
Hola, Jose.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.237
He was a runner in high school.

41:51.270 --> 41:52.938
- Thanks.
- Gracias.

41:52.972 --> 41:54.740
Gracias, Luis.

42:00.946 --> 42:02.047
Yeah.

42:18.030 --> 42:21.233
With his degree, he could've
worked in a better job,

42:21.267 --> 42:23.936
but he wanted to improve
the treatment of the workers.

42:23.969 --> 42:26.705
That's why he stayed
in the mines.

42:26.739 --> 42:28.274
So he was an organizer?

42:38.317 --> 42:39.952
He was getting started.

42:39.985 --> 42:42.721
Only Jose and other miners
know about his work.

42:46.158 --> 42:47.293
Jose...

42:59.838 --> 43:01.774
It's not gonna be easy.

43:01.807 --> 43:04.810
Immigrant miners
don't trust the cops.

43:07.379 --> 43:11.183
Many of them have been arrested
without committing a crime.

43:21.493 --> 43:23.862
Unless we can convince them.

43:26.465 --> 43:30.302
Well, we're gonna have to.

43:37.109 --> 43:39.445
We can't stop working.

43:39.478 --> 43:43.215
I will personally talk
to the owner of the mine

43:43.249 --> 43:45.217
to ask for permission.

43:45.251 --> 43:47.319
And our money?

43:47.353 --> 43:49.288
Who pays us?

43:51.090 --> 43:52.524
Well, I'll pay.

43:52.558 --> 43:54.893
I'll pay for your day's work.

43:54.927 --> 43:56.862
What about the police?

43:56.895 --> 43:59.265
Listen, if you help us,

43:59.298 --> 44:01.066
I will personally make sure

44:01.100 --> 44:02.935
that the cops
don't mess with you.

44:02.968 --> 44:06.005
You help us,
and we will help you.

45:32.458 --> 45:34.259
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

47:03.415 --> 47:06.351
It's Margaret,
please leave your message.

47:07.453 --> 47:08.487
Margie, where are you?

47:09.756 --> 47:13.625
Listen, I'm sorry about
last night's spat, all right?

47:13.660 --> 47:17.062
I'm all dressed up,
ready for the theater.

47:28.373 --> 47:30.342
Let's just have
a good time tonight

47:30.375 --> 47:32.544
like we used to, all right?

47:32.578 --> 47:34.213
All right,
I'm waiting for you.

47:34.246 --> 47:35.214
Bye.

47:37.449 --> 47:40.385
How the hell do you know
who's undocumented?

47:40.419 --> 47:43.388
If they run,
arrest them.

47:44.791 --> 47:47.192
You wanna go
to the theater tonight?

47:48.360 --> 47:49.328
Huh?

47:49.361 --> 47:51.263
Romeo and Juliet.

47:51.296 --> 47:52.464
You... you don't like it?

47:53.499 --> 47:54.801
Okay, but what if
they're lawfully here?

47:54.834 --> 47:56.468
Not our problem.

47:56.502 --> 47:58.805
They'll fix that
at the detention center.

47:58.838 --> 48:00.707
All right.

48:00.740 --> 48:01.708
Hm.

48:03.275 --> 48:04.644
Oh.

48:04.677 --> 48:08.213
Well, the ladies
like it, Charlie.

48:09.248 --> 48:10.482
Let's go, let's go.

48:13.786 --> 48:15.053
Go, go, go!

48:25.531 --> 48:27.165
Let's go.

48:27.199 --> 48:28.166
Documentos!

48:33.472 --> 48:34.674
Documentos.

48:34.707 --> 48:36.809
Open up!
Open up!

48:41.380 --> 48:42.649
Hands up,
put your fucking hands up.

48:42.682 --> 48:44.550
Get on your knees,
get on your knees.

48:44.583 --> 48:45.685
Hands behind your back.

48:45.718 --> 48:47.452
Give me that fucking cuff.

48:48.855 --> 48:50.155
Get the fuck up.

48:50.188 --> 48:51.156
Let's go.

48:51.189 --> 48:52.558
Go, out of this fucking place.

48:52.591 --> 48:53.760
Let's go,
come on.

49:08.775 --> 49:10.409
...is Code Four
at this time

49:10.442 --> 49:12.411
with.

49:12.444 --> 49:14.346
Additional transport
has been requested.

49:21.320 --> 49:23.155
Copy, all subjects in custody.

49:23.188 --> 49:25.858
We're requesting transport van
response to the motel.

49:29.428 --> 49:31.496
Copy request
for transport.

49:37.302 --> 49:38.170
How'd you, uh, know, um,

49:38.203 --> 49:40.539
undocumented workers
were staying here?

49:40.572 --> 49:42.174
We got a tip.

49:43.575 --> 49:45.544
If you don't mind
me asking, from who?

49:48.313 --> 49:50.349
Chief Collins.

49:50.382 --> 49:52.351
She knows everybody
in this town.

49:53.485 --> 49:55.253
Don't worry about it.

49:58.557 --> 49:59.792
So what happens
in there?

50:00.960 --> 50:02.260
Well...

50:04.229 --> 50:08.935
If found guilty of a crime,
they go to jail.

50:08.968 --> 50:13.572
And if not, they're deported
directly back to their country.

50:37.496 --> 50:39.398
Oh, shit.

50:52.979 --> 50:55.247
Margaret, is that you?

50:57.917 --> 51:00.753
Where were you?

51:00.787 --> 51:03.288
I was out
with my girlfriends.

51:04.957 --> 51:06.291
Yeah.

51:07.626 --> 51:09.394
What about
our theater night?

51:10.562 --> 51:12.632
I didn't forget, John,

51:12.665 --> 51:14.867
I just didn't
feel like going.

51:14.901 --> 51:18.236
Well, don't you think
you should have told me,

51:18.270 --> 51:20.238
I'm sitting there
waiting for you all night?

51:21.306 --> 51:23.810
Uh, I don't care, John.

51:23.843 --> 51:25.745
I don't care.

51:29.882 --> 51:31.616
Nobody cares.

51:58.044 --> 52:00.278
- Hello?
- Hi, John, it's Diana.

52:00.312 --> 52:01.180
I have bad news.

52:01.214 --> 52:02.949
I'm on my way
to the courthouse now.

52:02.982 --> 52:05.617
The police raided
the miners' housing last night.

52:05.651 --> 52:07.687
Whoever wasn't arrested
is too scared to show up

52:07.720 --> 52:08.721
to testify today.

52:08.755 --> 52:10.757
We're gonna have
to go ahead without them.

52:14.694 --> 52:17.063
Your Honor,
would you allow Mr. Wilson

52:17.096 --> 52:19.431
to speak on behalf
of the plaintiff?

52:19.464 --> 52:21.399
The plaintiff may proceed.

52:23.102 --> 52:26.438
Uh, Your Honor.

52:26.471 --> 52:28.674
Uh, first of all,
I'd just like to say,

52:28.708 --> 52:31.778
I can't believe
we're having this trial.

52:31.811 --> 52:34.579
To keep public records public?

52:34.613 --> 52:36.716
I mean, they're public
for a reason, aren't they?

52:36.749 --> 52:38.818
Mr. Wilson,
please make your point.

52:38.851 --> 52:40.585
Oh, yes, ma'am,
yes, ma'am.

52:40.619 --> 52:41.854
Uh, yes, Your Honor,
I mean.

52:42.922 --> 52:46.092
So, keeping these records
away from the public

52:46.125 --> 52:48.694
goes against our right
for a free press,

52:48.728 --> 52:52.765
the people's right to know,
and free speech.

52:52.799 --> 52:55.400
It's the core
of our democracy,

52:55.433 --> 52:57.904
and it's our right
as citizens of this country.

52:57.937 --> 52:59.337
That's my point.

52:59.371 --> 53:01.439
Mrs. Parks, your response.

53:02.942 --> 53:04.644
- I wasn't finished.
- That's okay.

53:04.677 --> 53:06.378
Releasing
the requested records

53:06.411 --> 53:08.681
will negatively affect
and endanger the lives

53:08.714 --> 53:11.684
of our city's
fine police officers.

53:11.717 --> 53:13.853
Making those records public
will also damage

53:13.886 --> 53:17.657
our officers' investigations
and slow down detective work.

53:17.690 --> 53:20.693
We strongly believe
that more damage will be done

53:20.726 --> 53:22.929
if these records
are made public.

53:22.962 --> 53:25.564
Furthermore, we have
to take into account

53:25.597 --> 53:27.599
the personal biases
that Mr. Wilson has

53:27.633 --> 53:31.637
against the police
and that motivate his paper.

53:31.671 --> 53:34.140
Your Honor, the defense
would like to request

53:34.173 --> 53:36.843
more time to gather
more evidence.

53:36.876 --> 53:38.010
We believe
with this evidence

53:38.044 --> 53:42.849
we can show the unethical
and possibly illegal methods

53:42.882 --> 53:45.417
in which Mr. Wilson
operates his newspaper.

53:45.450 --> 53:46.518
Objection, Your Honor.

53:46.551 --> 53:48.988
Objection overruled.

53:49.021 --> 53:50.790
The request is granted.

53:50.823 --> 53:51.891
Thank you, Your Honor.

53:57.663 --> 53:59.131
Well, that was a disaster.

53:59.165 --> 54:01.433
What was that?

54:01.466 --> 54:03.002
They're gonna countersue.

54:03.035 --> 54:04.704
I can smell it.

54:04.737 --> 54:07.039
They will subpoena
your newspaper's records,

54:07.073 --> 54:09.842
all your emails,
documents, everything.

54:09.876 --> 54:14.046
Believe me, they will spin
something to pin on you.

54:14.080 --> 54:15.547
Well, it's your job
to make sure

54:15.580 --> 54:16.716
that doesn't happen, Peter.

54:16.749 --> 54:18.017
Well, we have no option.

54:18.050 --> 54:19.852
If the judge approves
their subpoena,

54:19.886 --> 54:22.655
we have to hand over
everything they ask for.

54:22.688 --> 54:24.757
Chief Collins will
go after our reporters,

54:24.790 --> 54:26.125
their... their sources.

54:26.158 --> 54:29.128
Listen, we'll hide information
if we need to.

54:29.161 --> 54:30.796
Hell, we'll delete it.

54:30.830 --> 54:32.198
No, you won't.

54:32.231 --> 54:34.133
That would be
obstruction of justice.

54:34.166 --> 54:36.135
Please, don't fuck this up.

54:41.641 --> 54:42.942
I can't do this anymore.

54:44.677 --> 54:48.613
If you will just
stick to the plan,

54:48.648 --> 54:50.149
it will be fine.

54:54.586 --> 54:55.655
Are we done?

56:31.684 --> 56:32.718
Margaret!

56:48.367 --> 56:51.704
Are we in Heaven?

56:51.737 --> 56:52.772
It's Tucson.

56:52.805 --> 56:55.207
Oh.

56:55.241 --> 56:57.810
Back to my.

56:58.778 --> 57:00.212
Damn.

57:02.614 --> 57:05.051
I can't move my body.

57:05.084 --> 57:09.021
Hello, Mr. Wilson,
I'm Dr. Smith, the toxicologist.

57:09.055 --> 57:10.790
Dr. Matthews sent you here.

57:10.823 --> 57:12.691
Yeah?

57:12.725 --> 57:14.693
Olivia will take care
of your tests.

57:14.727 --> 57:15.961
Excuse me.

57:18.330 --> 57:20.166
Where's Margaret?

57:20.199 --> 57:21.200
She's back in town.

57:21.233 --> 57:23.969
Matt thought it was better
if I stay with you.

57:24.003 --> 57:26.138
I'll keep her posted.

57:26.172 --> 57:30.643
But you, my friend,
you need to rest, okay?

57:35.014 --> 57:36.849
You are very lucky

57:36.882 --> 57:39.718
that thallium did not
reach your nervous system.

57:39.752 --> 57:40.786
What... what do you call it?

57:40.820 --> 57:42.054
Thallium?

57:42.088 --> 57:43.989
It's a soft gray
metallic element

57:44.023 --> 57:47.026
often used to make
costume jewelry,

57:47.059 --> 57:49.095
paint, optical lenses.

57:49.128 --> 57:53.165
But thallium is also
a rat poison ingredient.

57:53.199 --> 57:55.367
We found 15 times
the normal level

57:55.401 --> 57:57.336
of thallium
in your system

57:57.369 --> 57:59.205
And based on
what we know,

57:59.238 --> 58:01.107
you didn't have any
environmental exposure

58:01.140 --> 58:03.109
to this metal.

58:07.813 --> 58:09.148
Hey, this is Samantha.

58:09.181 --> 58:10.850
Please leave a message.

58:26.198 --> 58:28.801
How would this thallium
get into me?

58:28.834 --> 58:30.936
Powdered over food,
dental floss.

58:30.970 --> 58:34.140
I've even seen people poisoned
through their eye drops.

58:34.173 --> 58:35.941
Sounds like
the perfect crime.

58:35.975 --> 58:38.043
It is, most victims die

58:38.077 --> 58:40.179
before they even know
they were poisoned.

58:41.147 --> 58:43.282
I'll tell you what,
the sonuvabitches

58:43.315 --> 58:46.785
that did this to me
are gonna pay for it.

58:46.819 --> 58:48.787
No, you see,
recently I got involved

58:48.821 --> 58:51.257
in a heated lawsuit
with the police.

58:53.292 --> 58:56.195
Someone over there
has been threatening me.

58:56.228 --> 58:59.798
I guess this is their way
of trying to get rid of me.

58:59.832 --> 59:01.333
- Recently?
- Mm-hm.

59:01.367 --> 59:04.270
Sorry, Mr. Wilson,
but your lab results show

59:04.303 --> 59:06.005
that you've been
consuming thallium

59:06.038 --> 59:07.873
for at least
the past year.

59:15.814 --> 59:17.249
The past year?

59:21.153 --> 59:24.089
We will continue
your treatment from home.

1:00:38.998 --> 1:00:39.965
You gotta call Margaret
and tell her

1:00:39.999 --> 1:00:41.934
I'm not coming home.

1:00:41.967 --> 1:00:43.135
You know she called the office.

1:00:43.168 --> 1:00:44.203
She wants to come tomorrow.

1:00:44.236 --> 1:00:45.204
Well, to hell with her.

1:00:45.237 --> 1:00:48.007
I don't wanna see her.

1:00:48.040 --> 1:00:49.908
I always knew
something was up with her.

1:00:49.942 --> 1:00:52.411
Yeah, you and everyone else
but me.

1:00:53.445 --> 1:00:54.546
Hey!

1:00:54.580 --> 1:00:56.015
Jesus.

1:00:56.048 --> 1:00:57.016
Sorry.

1:00:57.049 --> 1:00:58.417
You're still here.

1:00:58.450 --> 1:01:01.253
I found the names of the cops
who ran over Olivares.

1:01:01.287 --> 1:01:02.388
How'd you do that?

1:01:03.389 --> 1:01:05.291
It's not exactly legal.

1:01:10.062 --> 1:01:12.364
Officer Bradford
ran over him?

1:01:12.398 --> 1:01:14.900
There was another officer
involved.

1:01:14.933 --> 1:01:17.002
Deputy Ricky Johnson.

1:01:17.903 --> 1:01:19.071
Huh.

1:01:19.104 --> 1:01:20.906
- Mike?
- Yes, sir?

1:01:20.939 --> 1:01:22.975
Run the presses.

1:01:23.008 --> 1:01:25.077
John, if we run
one more publication,

1:01:25.110 --> 1:01:26.378
we're gonna get subpoenaed.

1:01:28.514 --> 1:01:33.018
Chief Collins delivered
this cease and desist order.

1:01:33.052 --> 1:01:34.953
- Cease and desist?
- Yes.

1:01:38.490 --> 1:01:40.326
You can't stop my paper.

1:01:40.359 --> 1:01:43.162
Why don't you ask
your lawyer about that?

1:01:43.195 --> 1:01:44.563
How 'bout I ask the courts
what they think

1:01:44.596 --> 1:01:47.132
of a crook in chief trying
to silence a journalist?

1:01:49.068 --> 1:01:50.536
John.

1:01:50.569 --> 1:01:52.237
You're not a journalist.

1:01:52.271 --> 1:01:54.106
And for your information,

1:01:54.139 --> 1:01:56.241
I take law enforcement
very seriously.

1:01:56.275 --> 1:01:58.177
I come from
a respectable family

1:01:58.210 --> 1:02:00.612
that sacrificed everything to
give you the freedom of press

1:02:00.647 --> 1:02:02.649
- you cry about.
- Oh, come on.

1:02:02.682 --> 1:02:04.383
Everybody knows
you don't give a fuck

1:02:04.416 --> 1:02:06.518
about those immigrant workers.

1:02:06.552 --> 1:02:09.455
I think this meeting
is over.

1:02:28.574 --> 1:02:30.976
Marge, I...

1:02:31.009 --> 1:02:33.045
I called you because...

1:02:34.446 --> 1:02:35.682
...we need to talk.

1:02:38.050 --> 1:02:39.418
I need to ask...

1:02:43.188 --> 1:02:44.223
No.

1:02:45.290 --> 1:02:46.425
No.

1:02:46.458 --> 1:02:49.161
I think it would be good
if we divorce.

1:02:50.963 --> 1:02:54.032
We need to divorce.

1:02:54.066 --> 1:02:55.434
Let's what I'll say.

1:03:15.187 --> 1:03:17.389
You're just as crazy
as your own family

1:03:17.423 --> 1:03:19.024
said you were.

1:03:22.394 --> 1:03:24.129
I don't want you here
anymore.

1:03:25.597 --> 1:03:28.434
Hey, guess what?

1:03:28.467 --> 1:03:32.037
Your plan to poison me
didn't work.

1:03:34.606 --> 1:03:38.243
You really think I was
trying to poison you, John?

1:03:38.277 --> 1:03:42.414
Hey, I'm divorcing you.

1:03:42.448 --> 1:03:44.116
Good.

1:03:44.149 --> 1:03:46.051
And I got a newsflash
for you.

1:03:46.084 --> 1:03:49.588
You're not getting
one red cent of my money.

1:03:51.323 --> 1:03:53.625
The lawyers will figure
that one out, John.

1:04:09.541 --> 1:04:11.577
What is this?

1:04:11.610 --> 1:04:13.646
Dammit.

1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:15.280
Shit.

1:04:15.314 --> 1:04:17.115
Seatbelt.

1:04:17.149 --> 1:04:18.116
Damn.

1:04:20.285 --> 1:04:22.554
Yes, sir?

1:04:22.588 --> 1:04:25.725
Hello, sir, can we have you step
out of the vehicle, please?

1:04:25.758 --> 1:04:27.626
- Step out of the vehicle?
- Yes, sir.

1:04:27.660 --> 1:04:30.062
Shut off the engine and step
out of the vehicle, please.

1:04:33.599 --> 1:04:34.767
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, can you come around

1:04:34.801 --> 1:04:36.134
to the front?

1:04:37.469 --> 1:04:39.238
Yeah, what's going on?

1:04:39.271 --> 1:04:40.807
Yes, sir,
we got you for violating

1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:42.742
a restraining order, okay?

1:04:42.775 --> 1:04:43.743
A what?

1:04:43.776 --> 1:04:45.377
A restraining order.

1:04:45.410 --> 1:04:51.116
Uh, I don't have
a restraining order, officer.

1:04:51.149 --> 1:04:54.620
Yeah, well, maybe you want
to check your mail.

1:04:56.221 --> 1:04:58.056
My mail?

1:04:58.090 --> 1:05:01.293
She told Chief Collins
I was aggressive with her?

1:05:01.326 --> 1:05:04.196
I... I never even
raised my voice!

1:05:04.229 --> 1:05:06.766
Do you even know
how restraining orders work?

1:05:06.799 --> 1:05:08.500
Well, you can talk
to Chief Collins about that.

1:05:08.534 --> 1:05:10.369
She's the one
who handled it.

1:05:10.402 --> 1:05:13.405
Now Mr. Wilson can go
if he posts bail,

1:05:13.438 --> 1:05:15.842
but he might have
to serve probation.

1:05:15.875 --> 1:05:17.476
Probation?

1:05:18.878 --> 1:05:21.313
You... you've got
to be kidding me.

1:05:21.346 --> 1:05:24.216
She was the one that was
burning up all of my stuff.

1:05:24.249 --> 1:05:27.219
I know what
this is really about.

1:05:27.252 --> 1:05:29.388
You're not gonna make me
give up my investigation

1:05:29.421 --> 1:05:31.824
of the Olivares case.

1:05:31.858 --> 1:05:33.392
With all due respect,
I would never...

1:05:33.425 --> 1:05:35.594
Save your explanations
for later

1:05:35.627 --> 1:05:39.264
when you're gonna need them
in a court of law.

1:05:57.549 --> 1:06:01.453
Well, her car's not
parked in front, so...

1:06:01.486 --> 1:06:03.488
Looks clear to me.

1:06:03.522 --> 1:06:05.290
The only reason I can think
that she doesn't want me

1:06:05.324 --> 1:06:08.260
going in there is she's
still got poison inside.

1:06:09.461 --> 1:06:12.264
Listen, shouldn't we get
a PI or something for this?

1:06:12.297 --> 1:06:13.365
Somebody professional?

1:06:13.398 --> 1:06:15.702
No! Come on, man.
This is fun.

1:06:15.735 --> 1:06:16.903
We'll figure it out.

1:06:20.707 --> 1:06:22.541
Don't forget
to call my cell

1:06:22.574 --> 1:06:23.876
- if you see her come.
- Okay.

1:06:36.789 --> 1:06:37.757
Shoot.

1:06:43.261 --> 1:06:45.497
John, John, John.

1:06:57.810 --> 1:06:59.344
Son of a bitch.

1:07:18.497 --> 1:07:19.799
Okay, we should be clear now.

1:07:19.832 --> 1:07:20.800
Did you see that?

1:07:20.833 --> 1:07:21.768
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go.

1:07:21.801 --> 1:07:24.804
- Let's follow them.
- Wait, what do you mean?

1:07:24.837 --> 1:07:26.338
Come on, John!

1:07:47.994 --> 1:07:50.462
- She got in.
- Ready to go?

1:07:50.495 --> 1:07:52.699
Yeah. Jeez, I can't...

1:07:52.732 --> 1:07:53.666
Tonight would not
be a good night

1:07:53.700 --> 1:07:56.201
to have one
of your little heart attacks.

1:07:57.302 --> 1:07:58.537
I should be fine.

1:08:00.405 --> 1:08:01.808
Where'd you get that?

1:08:01.841 --> 1:08:03.475
Back in Tucson.

1:08:03.508 --> 1:08:05.878
We just need to get close enough
to get a good shot.

1:08:05.912 --> 1:08:06.979
And...

1:08:09.481 --> 1:08:10.582
Telephoto lens.

1:08:13.318 --> 1:08:14.187
That's great.

1:08:15.822 --> 1:08:17.522
John.

1:08:17.556 --> 1:08:19.491
What is that for?

1:08:19.524 --> 1:08:21.526
Self-defense mostly.

1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:23.495
If tonight goes smoothly,

1:08:23.528 --> 1:08:26.565
I'll buy you a table dance
at Pancho's.

1:08:29.534 --> 1:08:30.870
What do you mean
you can't find it?

1:08:35.708 --> 1:08:37.509
I see somebody there.

1:08:40.079 --> 1:08:41.781
I think he's her accomplice.

1:08:41.814 --> 1:08:43.683
- Think so?
- It was here!

1:08:43.716 --> 1:08:45.283
- What are they doing?
- It was here.

1:08:47.787 --> 1:08:48.888
Watch it.

1:08:51.691 --> 1:08:52.759
Let's get closer.

1:09:05.905 --> 1:09:07.039
All right.

1:09:11.376 --> 1:09:12.779
I'm gonna take a picture now.

1:09:19.752 --> 1:09:23.055
If you will just relax,
everything will be all right.

1:09:31.864 --> 1:09:33.833
- I didn't know it had a flash.
- Who's there?

1:09:37.904 --> 1:09:39.906
Now you want to know
what this is for?

1:09:49.015 --> 1:09:49.982
You okay?

1:09:51.117 --> 1:09:52.084
Mike.

1:09:52.118 --> 1:09:53.451
- Split.
- Split.

1:09:53.485 --> 1:09:54.754
Wait in the car.

1:10:14.439 --> 1:10:15.607
Wait.

1:10:16.843 --> 1:10:17.977
Don't shoot.

1:10:20.478 --> 1:10:22.114
I got one question.

1:10:24.516 --> 1:10:27.385
Did you give
Margaret the poison?

1:10:27.419 --> 1:10:28.587
Was that you?

1:10:32.557 --> 1:10:33.926
Mike! Agh!

1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:35.427
Run, John, run!

1:10:39.464 --> 1:10:40.666
Come on, Mike!

1:10:41.834 --> 1:10:42.935
Ow!

1:10:47.106 --> 1:10:49.441
- John.
- What?

1:10:49.474 --> 1:10:50.575
I think I got shot.

1:10:50.609 --> 1:10:51.543
Oh, buddy,
hold on, man.

1:10:51.576 --> 1:10:52.345
It's not so bad though,
it's not so bad.

1:10:52.377 --> 1:10:53.946
Mike, hold... hold...
just hold on.

1:10:53.980 --> 1:10:54.947
Okay.

1:10:55.982 --> 1:10:57.049
But hurry, please.

1:10:57.083 --> 1:10:58.084
Hold on.

1:11:05.958 --> 1:11:06.993
Help!

1:11:08.828 --> 1:11:11.197
- I need a doctor.
- Ah, geez.

1:11:11.230 --> 1:11:13.565
Okay, let me see.

1:11:13.598 --> 1:11:15.034
It looks worse
than it actually is.

1:11:15.067 --> 1:11:16.035
It's gonna be fine.

1:12:15.027 --> 1:12:17.229
John Wilson just published
a bombshell this morning.

1:12:17.263 --> 1:12:19.732
He is accusing Sedcott Police
of covering up

1:12:19.765 --> 1:12:23.568
their involvement in the recent
Olivares hit-and-run accident.

1:12:23.601 --> 1:12:26.072
Separately, he is also
accusing his own wife

1:12:26.105 --> 1:12:27.940
of trying to poison him.

1:12:27.974 --> 1:12:29.208
And here's the kicker.

1:12:29.241 --> 1:12:31.711
John is so convinced
of his wife's guilt

1:12:31.744 --> 1:12:35.114
that he is offering
a $12,000 reward

1:12:35.147 --> 1:12:37.650
for dirt on her
and her alleged accomplice.

1:12:37.683 --> 1:12:40.585
Now that kind of cash
is bound to jog

1:12:40.618 --> 1:12:41.619
quite a few memories,

1:12:41.654 --> 1:12:44.724
so y'all better act fast
if you know anything.

1:12:50.696 --> 1:12:52.999
I want Bradford
on desk duty immediately,

1:12:53.032 --> 1:12:54.633
do you understand?

1:12:54.667 --> 1:12:56.969
No, I don't understand.

1:12:57.003 --> 1:12:59.238
Listen, the article
in today's paper's killing me.

1:12:59.271 --> 1:13:01.907
We have to at least look
like we're taking action,

1:13:01.941 --> 1:13:04.977
and I want you to stop
with the goddamn raids for now.

1:13:05.011 --> 1:13:06.912
We need those raids.

1:13:06.946 --> 1:13:08.247
Those raids are necessary.

1:13:08.280 --> 1:13:10.316
How else are we gonna
make our numbers?

1:13:10.349 --> 1:13:13.886
Let's lie low for now until
this whole thing blows over.

1:13:13.919 --> 1:13:17.189
In the meantime, find the guy
who ran over the mine worker.

1:13:18.657 --> 1:13:20.192
I know you think
this is nothing,

1:13:20.226 --> 1:13:23.162
but we can't afford
to let this get out of control.

1:13:29.601 --> 1:13:32.071
So, okay, we'll be here.

1:13:32.104 --> 1:13:33.105
Okay.

1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:35.607
Looks like people are calling.

1:13:35.641 --> 1:13:37.943
John, you need to come
and watch this.

1:13:37.977 --> 1:13:39.912
Come and watch what?

1:13:39.945 --> 1:13:42.048
- What about?
- John.

1:13:42.081 --> 1:13:43.849
- I wanna start by saying...
- Oh yeah.

1:13:43.883 --> 1:13:45.851
...I am deeply sorry
for the death

1:13:45.885 --> 1:13:48.187
of Federico Olivares.

1:13:48.220 --> 1:13:51.824
Despite what certain newspapers
have alleged this morning,

1:13:51.857 --> 1:13:53.759
our internal investigation
has cleared

1:13:53.793 --> 1:13:56.028
both Officer Bradford
and Deputy Johnson

1:13:56.062 --> 1:13:58.864
from any wrongdoing
in this incident.

1:13:58.898 --> 1:14:01.967
Federico's father and son
are good people,

1:14:02.001 --> 1:14:04.637
and I will do my best
to find the person

1:14:04.670 --> 1:14:06.872
that murdered Federico.

1:14:06.906 --> 1:14:08.941
We are re-opening
the investigation,

1:14:08.974 --> 1:14:11.944
which I will lead myself.

1:14:11.977 --> 1:14:13.679
Whoa.

1:14:13.712 --> 1:14:15.147
Also, we've been investigating

1:14:15.181 --> 1:14:17.083
the poisoning case
of Mr. Wilson,

1:14:17.116 --> 1:14:19.151
and so far
we have found no proof

1:14:19.185 --> 1:14:22.888
that would place Tucker Ellis
or Margaret Wilson as suspects,

1:14:22.922 --> 1:14:26.092
much less
persons of interest.

1:14:26.125 --> 1:14:29.195
We believe that Mr. Wilson
is no longer worthy of trust,

1:14:29.228 --> 1:14:32.398
as he is using his newspaper
to personally attack his wife.

1:14:32.431 --> 1:14:35.267
- Christ.
- If you read the Libre Post,

1:14:35.301 --> 1:14:37.369
I say this to you.

1:14:37.403 --> 1:14:40.072
Don't believe anything
you read in that phony paper.

1:14:40.106 --> 1:14:43.042
It is all fake
if you ask me.

1:14:44.376 --> 1:14:46.278
We're also investigating
the possibility

1:14:46.312 --> 1:14:50.082
that Mr. Wilson poisoned
himself to frame his wife.

1:14:51.183 --> 1:14:52.318
Oh yeah.

1:14:52.351 --> 1:14:54.353
Yeah. Yeah.

1:14:54.386 --> 1:14:56.055
That sounds like me,
doesn't it?

1:14:56.088 --> 1:14:58.090
I poisoned myself. Yeah.

1:14:58.124 --> 1:14:59.425
Jesus Christ.

1:14:59.458 --> 1:15:02.027
Hello, where's my daily poison?

1:15:02.061 --> 1:15:03.729
It's time.

1:15:36.061 --> 1:15:38.097
You say what?

1:15:38.130 --> 1:15:41.433
No, we're not giving money
away like that.

1:15:41.467 --> 1:15:43.903
No, we...

1:15:43.936 --> 1:15:45.037
Sir, no.

1:15:45.070 --> 1:15:47.373
Sir, I'm sorry. Sorry.

1:15:48.440 --> 1:15:49.742
Levita.

1:16:07.059 --> 1:16:09.361
Can't believe he escaped.

1:16:12.064 --> 1:16:14.133
Doesn't surprise me
that much actually.

1:16:14.166 --> 1:16:17.403
What if the whole thing
was a setup?

1:16:17.436 --> 1:16:19.772
- What do you mean?
- Yeah.

1:16:19.805 --> 1:16:22.741
The Olivares case,
the poisoning.

1:16:22.775 --> 1:16:24.877
The lawsuit.

1:16:24.910 --> 1:16:26.445
Maybe they just
wanted to hook us

1:16:26.478 --> 1:16:28.514
so they can get rid
of the newspaper.

1:16:28.547 --> 1:16:30.115
You really think so?

1:16:30.149 --> 1:16:32.484
No, but it'd make
a cool story to publish.

1:16:36.088 --> 1:16:37.156
Ma'am, how can I help you?

1:16:37.189 --> 1:16:39.425
I'm here to pick up
my takeout.

1:16:39.458 --> 1:16:41.527
- The name?
- Margaret.

1:16:41.560 --> 1:16:42.528
Here it is.

1:16:47.499 --> 1:16:50.269
Would you like some thallium
spiked with that, ma'am?

1:16:55.140 --> 1:16:57.042
Well, that was unfortunate.

1:16:57.076 --> 1:16:59.511
Did you see the look
she gave me?

1:16:59.545 --> 1:17:01.914
Chief Collins said she isn't
gonna do anything about her.

1:17:01.947 --> 1:17:03.082
What about the pictures
with Tucker?

1:17:03.115 --> 1:17:04.383
Oh, they interrogated Margaret.

1:17:04.416 --> 1:17:06.418
She didn't know anything.

1:17:06.452 --> 1:17:08.320
And they let her go,
just like that?

1:17:08.354 --> 1:17:09.455
It's her word against ours.

1:17:09.488 --> 1:17:10.889
Nothing we can do about it.

1:17:13.292 --> 1:17:15.527
Well, I appreciate you
getting shot for me.

1:17:18.163 --> 1:17:19.198
That's what friends
are for.

1:17:19.231 --> 1:17:22.134
But it's not every friend
that would do that.

1:17:22.167 --> 1:17:24.303
I appreciate it, buddy.

1:17:24.336 --> 1:17:25.337
Wow.

1:17:27.239 --> 1:17:30.809
Couple of shot-up old men,
that's all we are.

1:17:48.160 --> 1:17:50.396
At the tone,
please record your message.

1:17:51.463 --> 1:17:52.931
Hello? Mr. Wilson?

1:17:52.965 --> 1:17:54.433
This is Officer Johnson.

1:17:54.466 --> 1:17:56.835
I think I have some information
about the Olivares case

1:17:56.869 --> 1:17:59.038
that you might
find interesting.

1:17:59.071 --> 1:18:00.572
Now, I know we haven't
gotten off to the best start,

1:18:00.606 --> 1:18:03.876
but I promise
it'll be worth your while.

1:18:03.909 --> 1:18:06.078
If you're interested,
meet me tomorrow at the cafe

1:18:06.111 --> 1:18:08.981
on Highway 50 just outside
of town, 7:00 a.m.

1:18:53.525 --> 1:18:56.095
I've been following
Bradford around.

1:18:56.128 --> 1:18:57.563
He led me to this.

1:18:57.596 --> 1:18:59.064
Check it out.

1:19:11.210 --> 1:19:12.177
What is it?

1:19:12.211 --> 1:19:14.146
Well, just wait.

1:19:14.179 --> 1:19:15.614
Give it another minute or so.

1:19:33.565 --> 1:19:37.637
See? There's Bradford,
and he's got Tucker with him.

1:19:37.670 --> 1:19:39.438
Now I'm not exactly sure
what they got going on,

1:19:39.471 --> 1:19:42.107
but Tucker's a part
of his operation.

1:19:43.242 --> 1:19:45.310
They have a lot of migrant
workers down there too.

1:19:47.379 --> 1:19:48.380
John?

1:19:50.683 --> 1:19:53.485
Federico was alive
when I first saw him.

1:19:53.519 --> 1:19:54.987
I thought his death
was an accident,

1:19:55.020 --> 1:19:56.689
but now I'm not so sure.

1:19:56.723 --> 1:19:57.956
I don't have
any proof for this,

1:19:57.990 --> 1:20:02.461
but I think Bradford found out
he was organizing the miners.

1:20:02.494 --> 1:20:04.096
I wouldn't be surprised
if they orchestrated

1:20:04.129 --> 1:20:06.532
the accident to pressure
the miners to be quiet.

1:20:11.771 --> 1:20:13.138
Yeah.

1:20:15.307 --> 1:20:17.109
You think they were
behind the poisoning?

1:20:18.310 --> 1:20:20.078
I think so.

1:20:20.112 --> 1:20:21.681
But we gotta find
some proof first.

1:20:25.117 --> 1:20:26.653
Would you help me?

1:20:26.686 --> 1:20:28.353
With what?

1:20:28.387 --> 1:20:30.289
Tell the story.

1:20:33.726 --> 1:20:36.128
Let's do it.

1:20:36.161 --> 1:20:41.099
I have to say, officer,
I had you all wrong.

1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:50.042
And here with us
is John Wilson.

1:20:50.075 --> 1:20:51.678
And, John,
tell us about your story,

1:20:51.711 --> 1:20:54.413
which I have to admit
sounds more like a movie script

1:20:54.446 --> 1:20:56.548
- out of Hollywood.
- Well, first of all,

1:20:56.582 --> 1:20:58.350
I want to mention
that in today's Libre Post

1:20:58.383 --> 1:21:01.053
there's an article
with the story.

1:21:01.086 --> 1:21:03.489
This publication
is just the beginning.

1:21:03.522 --> 1:21:05.390
More will come
as our journalists

1:21:05.424 --> 1:21:08.327
continue to investigate
this corrupt operation.

1:21:08.360 --> 1:21:09.729
Our reporters
are working hard

1:21:09.762 --> 1:21:11.597
to put together
all the proof needed

1:21:11.631 --> 1:21:13.766
to start
an official investigation.

1:21:18.370 --> 1:21:19.338
And then tell... tell us, John,

1:21:19.371 --> 1:21:21.540
what motivated you
to do this?

1:21:21.573 --> 1:21:24.744
Well, for one thing,
I am tired of seeing the cops

1:21:24.777 --> 1:21:26.813
do whatever the hell
they want in this town

1:21:26.846 --> 1:21:28.213
and getting away
with it.

1:21:29.248 --> 1:21:32.384
I mean, if we don't
hold them accountable,

1:21:32.417 --> 1:21:34.453
no one will.

1:21:34.486 --> 1:21:36.321
By looking
at the public records

1:21:36.355 --> 1:21:38.357
and using
our inside sources,

1:21:38.390 --> 1:21:40.359
we've been able to see
that there is a number

1:21:40.392 --> 1:21:44.797
of injustices happening at
the hands of the local police.

1:21:44.831 --> 1:21:47.299
So, I'm just, uh,

1:21:47.332 --> 1:21:52.271
trying to help the citizens
and do what's right.

1:21:52.304 --> 1:21:53.472
All right, John,
wrapping up today.

1:21:53.505 --> 1:21:57.376
Any final thoughts you want
to leave our audience with?

1:21:57.409 --> 1:21:58.678
Well, justice
is not being served

1:21:58.711 --> 1:22:00.847
for myself and for others
in this town,

1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:02.147
and sometimes...

1:22:03.515 --> 1:22:06.218
...in order to get justice,

1:22:06.251 --> 1:22:08.086
you have to get dirty.

1:22:08.120 --> 1:22:10.088
And that's what I'm doing.

1:22:10.122 --> 1:22:12.391
I'm rolling up
my sleeves

1:22:12.424 --> 1:22:14.192
and I'm doing
the dirty work.

1:22:55.635 --> 1:22:57.169
Hey, this is Samantha.

1:22:57.202 --> 1:22:58.203
Please leave a message.

1:22:59.538 --> 1:23:01.808
Sammy, it's your dad.

1:23:01.841 --> 1:23:04.176
I just...

1:23:04.209 --> 1:23:06.646
I know I made a lot
of mistakes, okay?

1:23:06.679 --> 1:23:10.215
With your mom
and with you.

1:23:11.516 --> 1:23:15.420
I just want you to know
that, um...

1:23:15.454 --> 1:23:17.690
in my heart
I never left you.

1:23:19.759 --> 1:23:21.460
Um, all right?

1:23:21.493 --> 1:23:22.662
So, uh...

1:23:24.596 --> 1:23:27.934
I'm here if you need me, okay?

1:23:27.967 --> 1:23:30.369
All right, I miss ya.

1:23:30.402 --> 1:23:31.704
Bye.

1:24:53.019 --> 1:24:55.587
Hello, Sedcott, it looks
like the wrongful death suit

1:24:55.620 --> 1:24:57.790
filed against the city
by the Olivares family

1:24:57.824 --> 1:24:59.692
will be settled
out of court today.

1:24:59.726 --> 1:25:01.928
No official word yet
from the city or police,

1:25:01.961 --> 1:25:03.863
but this news
is not surprising

1:25:03.896 --> 1:25:06.364
given the mounting public
pressure on law enforcement

1:25:06.398 --> 1:25:09.601
generated by the continued
articles in Libre Post.

1:25:09.635 --> 1:25:11.771
It remains to be seen
if additional repercussions

1:25:11.804 --> 1:25:13.673
will be forthcoming
for the department,

1:25:13.706 --> 1:25:15.507
but I can tell you this.

1:25:15.540 --> 1:25:18.978
John Wilson is unlikely
to let this rest.

1:25:19.011 --> 1:25:20.980
Interesting days ahead, folks.

1:25:21.013 --> 1:25:22.014
Indeed.

1:25:22.048 --> 1:25:25.617
Hey, stay tuned,
this is Chuck at AM1660, KTNB.

1:25:25.651 --> 1:25:27.653
We'll be right back.
