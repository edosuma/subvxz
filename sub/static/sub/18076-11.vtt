and the steel that he uses...

from under it without losing his license.

He's in the limo with Jilly.

32:23.325 --> 32:26.492
TOMMY: We'II have a nice taIk
and he'II teII me Iots of cute things.

32:26.871 --> 32:30.037
And while he's at the river
learning how to breathe underwater...

32:30.124 --> 32:33.493
l'll go over and show these guys
how to pour some concrete.

32:33.711 --> 32:35.454
B.A., get us down.

32:35.546 --> 32:37.124
B.A.: What?
HANNlBAL: They got face.

32:46.515 --> 32:48.175
You got a light?

32:50.478 --> 32:52.055
-Sure.
-Thanks.

32:55.649 --> 32:56.812
Nice.

33:06.077 --> 33:08.402
Mr. Tillis has excellent taste.

33:12.750 --> 33:14.789

33:16.420 --> 33:18.792
Even l know sherry doesn't have years.

33:18.881 --> 33:23.460
No, l was speaking of the original vintage
upon which the sherry was based.

[Fast-paced instrumental music continues]

34:30.870 --> 34:34.286
lt had to be.
lt's the same guys that took the payroll.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.449
-You think?
-Yeah.

34:36.833 --> 34:38.708
TOMMY: All right, that's it.

34:39.170 --> 34:42.585
l tried it your way. A couple of accidents,
knock out his payroll.

34:42.672 --> 34:45.295
l'll go in there and do it
the way it should've been done.

34:45.384 --> 34:47.840
The way you should've done it
from the top, you hear me?

34:47.928 --> 34:49.007
Tommy.

34:49.513 --> 34:50.757
TOMMY: Jilly.

34:50.889 --> 34:53.132
TOMMY: You get me together
a good bunch of soldiers.

34:53.225 --> 34:56.344
TOMMY: Tell them we got four bozos here
with automatic weapons.

34:56.437 --> 34:59.722
And we're gonna wrap them
in white satin by morning.

35:08.324 --> 35:10.363

-[Growling] Come on!

35:13.537 --> 35:15.613
What kept you guys anyway?

35:16.540 --> 35:20.752
l told you to stay close to Crazy Tommy T,
but you got a little ridiculous.

35:20.836 --> 35:23.043
You know what that means now, don't you?

35:23.130 --> 35:26.048
You don't just kick Tommy T in the face
and then walk away.

35:26.133 --> 35:28.042
You probably slide away on a roller board...

35:28.135 --> 35:30.424
by the time he's finished working
on your knee caps.

35:30.513 --> 35:34.213
l thought we were caught up
in a jurisdictional dispute between hardhats.

35:34.308 --> 35:38.092
But it looks like we kicked over a rock
and found a scorpion.

35:38.562 --> 35:41.350
l think better with a fresh cigar. Face?

35:41.857 --> 35:45.558
Sorry, Hannibal.
l had to use my last cigar to escape.

RANDY: How's it going, Uncle Mick?
MlCKEY: lt couldn't be better.

36:08.843 --> 36:10.882
We really beat those guys this time.

Mickey, get your guys off the job.

Denham's not the problem.
We kicked over the real monster.

-Crazy Tommy Tillis.
-The mobster?

36:37.037 --> 36:38.911
He used to own this warehouse once.

36:38.998 --> 36:42.746
Yeah, and he turned your building site
into a mausoleum for his ex-partner.

36:42.835 --> 36:45.207
Tillis killed him
and Denham poured the concrete?

36:45.296 --> 36:47.538
HANNlBAL: That's why you've had
so much interference.

36:47.631 --> 36:50.383
They don't want you messing
with the foundations here.

36:50.468 --> 36:52.591
You mean we've been digging up a grave?

36:52.678 --> 36:54.718
l'm more worried about our graves.

36:54.805 --> 36:58.470
That's why l want you, your niece
and your men off this job. Now move it.

45:04.336 --> 45:06.662

45:06.756 --> 45:08.914
and then cheerfully poured concrete
all over him.

through the cement and found the evidence.

where the bodies are buried.

l am telling you,
the mere presence of a dog...

the deceased more quickly.
