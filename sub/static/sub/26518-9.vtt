WEBVTT

00:01.134 --> 00:03.136
(announcer)
Previously on "Blindspot"...

00:04.504 --> 00:06.340
Hobbes... it's me, it's Remi.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.509
From what I can tell, I'm still
undercover with the FBI.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.010
(Roman)
Think Weller's onto you?

00:10.010 --> 00:12.513
Think you're you again?

00:12.513 --> 00:13.480
Whoever this is,

00:13.480 --> 00:14.748
he just became
our most wanted.

00:14.748 --> 00:17.684
This method could reawaken
Jane's memories.

00:25.392 --> 00:26.760
Uhh!

00:26.760 --> 00:28.061
Argh!

00:28.061 --> 00:29.897
Jane... stop.

00:29.897 --> 00:31.965
I'm not Jane!

00:31.965 --> 00:33.467
(both grunting)

00:39.806 --> 00:41.975
Aagh! Jane!

00:41.975 --> 00:43.110
Uhh!

00:44.144 --> 00:46.880
Please... don't
make me do this.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.081
Don't.

00:48.949 --> 00:50.317
(both grunting)

00:52.653 --> 00:53.620
Uhh!

00:56.123 --> 00:58.258
(Jane grunting)

01:01.428 --> 01:04.097
(Jane)
Your wife is gone.

01:04.097 --> 01:06.133
Agh!
Not if I can help it.

01:06.133 --> 01:08.535
(Jane grunting
and gasping)

01:11.571 --> 01:12.773
(spits)

01:12.773 --> 01:14.207
Uhh!

01:14.207 --> 01:16.343
(panting)

01:21.615 --> 01:23.650
Agh! Uhh!

01:34.394 --> 01:37.164
Tasha, drop the gun.

01:37.164 --> 01:38.532
You know
I'm a better shot.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.700
Well, are you
a better shot twice?

01:39.700 --> 01:42.536
'Cause this is not
a football bet.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.072
You really
gonna kill me?

01:45.072 --> 01:47.507
Fine, go ahead.
Shoot.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.311
Then drop the gun.

02:00.687 --> 02:01.688
(kicks gun away)

02:01.688 --> 02:02.789
Turn around.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.326
(handcuffs snapping)

02:06.326 --> 02:07.661
You have the right
to remain silent.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.229
Anything you say can
and will be...

02:09.229 --> 02:11.665
(heart monitor beeping)

02:13.567 --> 02:15.235
Special Agent
Dr. Nancy Williams.

02:15.235 --> 02:16.636
FBI by way
of Harvard Medical's

02:16.636 --> 02:19.339
Computational Neurobiology
and Behavior department.

02:19.339 --> 02:21.441
Special Agent Kurt Weller.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.243
(Patterson)
Let's be honest.

02:23.243 --> 02:25.979
As a scientist,
this procedure scares me.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.581
But with the help of Nancy,

02:27.581 --> 02:29.416
we have gone through
the technical specs

02:29.416 --> 02:32.352
of Roman's data cache
to the letter.

02:32.352 --> 02:33.754
How does this work?

02:33.754 --> 02:37.758
The introduction of ZIP
into Jane's system

02:37.758 --> 02:40.527
effectively established
a barrier in her brain.

02:40.527 --> 02:42.362
She could create
and retain new memories,

02:42.362 --> 02:44.364
but all of her previous ones

02:44.364 --> 02:46.333
were completely
closed off to her.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.435
But the prolonged effects
of ZIP poisoning

02:48.435 --> 02:49.970
seemed to have
flipped a switch,

02:49.970 --> 02:52.606
changing which side of
the barrier she has access to.

02:52.606 --> 02:55.575
If this procedure works,
it should flip it back,

02:55.575 --> 02:57.544
forcing Remi's personality
out of dominance

02:57.544 --> 02:58.779
and bringing the woman

02:58.779 --> 03:01.782
you all know and love
back to you.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.384
Okay, so...
what do you mean "should"?

03:04.384 --> 03:05.852
This guy's methods
were unorthodox,

03:05.852 --> 03:08.188
and the clinical trials
were very short-lived.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.689
But the research
is solid-- I mean,

03:09.689 --> 03:11.358
when the results were good,
they were very good.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.993
What, and so when
they were bad,

03:12.993 --> 03:15.128
they killed someone?

03:15.128 --> 03:16.963
(Rich)
All right, you see
these current patterns

03:16.963 --> 03:18.932
on the left here
that I've coded in red?

03:18.932 --> 03:20.033
That's Remi.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.201
The older patterns,

03:21.201 --> 03:22.602
the ones labeled in blue,

03:22.602 --> 03:23.937
on the right,
that's Jane.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.772
That is what we're
trying to reactivate.

03:25.772 --> 03:28.975
Kurt... once we
start this process,

03:28.975 --> 03:31.478
we can't just pull the plug
if it goes sideways.

03:31.478 --> 03:34.915
Stopping in the middle
will kill her.

03:36.783 --> 03:37.951
Do it.

03:42.289 --> 03:45.158
(Weller)
Come back to me, Jane.

03:52.365 --> 03:56.369
(distant crowd chattering)

03:56.369 --> 03:57.704
(whimpers softly)

03:57.704 --> 03:59.773
(distant chatter continues)

03:59.773 --> 04:03.343
Hello? Hello?

04:03.343 --> 04:05.178
Help me.
Someone help me.

04:05.178 --> 04:06.379
(man #1)
You know whose bag this is?

04:06.379 --> 04:07.848
(man #2)
No clue.

04:07.848 --> 04:11.451
(man #1)
Ma'am... do you know
whose bag this is?

04:11.451 --> 04:13.086
Excuse me,
is this yours?

04:15.489 --> 04:16.690
(muffled)
Help me!

04:16.690 --> 04:18.758
(man #2)
No signs of radiation.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.828
Commencing
manual inspection.

04:23.463 --> 04:27.200
Nothing anomalous
on the exterior.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.902
Okay, I'm gonna
feel for wires.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.037
Let's see what we're
dealing with here.

04:31.037 --> 04:33.874
(man gasps)

04:33.874 --> 04:35.942
There's something
in there!

04:35.942 --> 04:38.011
(zipping)

04:40.914 --> 04:42.616
(panting)

04:45.318 --> 04:47.487
Turn around!
On your knees!

04:47.487 --> 04:50.023
Hands on your head! Now!

04:53.527 --> 04:55.095
(Bethany)
Do you recognize her?

04:55.095 --> 04:56.363
(Weller)
No.

04:56.363 --> 04:58.098
I've never seen that woman
before in my life.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.799
(Jane)
Okay, I want to speak
to someone in charge.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.101
(man)
Just take a deep breath.

05:01.101 --> 05:04.604
I want to speak
to someone in charge!

05:05.972 --> 05:07.541
(static)

05:10.310 --> 05:12.612
(breathing hard)

05:22.956 --> 05:26.226
I'm Special Agent
Kurt Weller.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.094
I'm lead agent
on your case.

05:28.094 --> 05:31.031
Please tell me
you know what's going on.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.566
Who am I?

05:35.235 --> 05:37.771
We don't know... yet.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.344
Do you recognize me?

05:46.146 --> 05:48.448
Why would I...

05:48.448 --> 05:51.084
I don't even
recognize me.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.687
Why would you
be familiar?

05:56.556 --> 05:59.092
Because my name...

05:59.092 --> 06:00.460
Kurt Weller...

06:00.460 --> 06:03.296
is tattooed
on your back.

06:03.296 --> 06:04.397
(gasping)

06:04.397 --> 06:05.966
I don't understand
any of this.

06:05.966 --> 06:10.403
I know this is...
a little overwhelming.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.042
Please try.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.911
Something may
come back to you.

06:19.646 --> 06:22.382
(distant voices echoing)

06:41.334 --> 06:42.602
Anything?

06:44.938 --> 06:46.740
No.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.112
(alarm beeping)

06:53.280 --> 06:55.315
(alarm continues)

06:55.315 --> 06:56.416
(Weller)
What's going on?

06:56.416 --> 06:57.984
(Williams)
Her vitals are spiking.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.386
(Weller)
Why is this happening?

06:59.386 --> 07:01.388
(Williams)
I don't know, it shouldn't be.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.394
Hey...

07:07.394 --> 07:08.495
I can't lose her.

07:08.495 --> 07:10.563
(shaky)
I can't.

07:10.563 --> 07:11.564
You won't.

07:11.564 --> 07:13.133
How do you know that?

07:13.133 --> 07:15.502
You saw what was
happening in there.

07:15.502 --> 07:18.772
I said yes
to that treatment.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.507
I put her
in that position!

07:20.507 --> 07:24.911
Hey, Kurt, we are doing
everything that we can.

07:24.911 --> 07:28.715
I can't im-- I can't imagine
my life without her.

07:28.715 --> 07:31.251
Jane needs you in there
doing everything you can.

07:31.251 --> 07:34.054
We don't know what she can
feel or what she can hear,

07:34.054 --> 07:36.022
so you gotta stand beside her
and hold her hand

07:36.022 --> 07:37.557
and tell her
that she can do this.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.292
Because she can.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.328
If you want your wife back,
Jane is not the only one

07:41.328 --> 07:44.864
who needs to fight right now--
you gotta fight, too.

07:44.864 --> 07:45.965
Come on.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.134
Get in there.
Let's go do this.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.336
(sniffles)

07:49.336 --> 07:50.603
Okay.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.006
All right.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.078
(heart monitor beeping)

08:01.181 --> 08:02.582
Jane...

08:03.650 --> 08:06.886
Come on, Jane.
You can do this.

08:06.886 --> 08:08.955
(echoing)
I'm right here...

08:16.996 --> 08:18.698
(faint grunt)

08:26.306 --> 08:27.874
(whispers)
I love you.

08:27.874 --> 08:30.977
(Jane)
You... you're
my starting point.

08:30.977 --> 08:32.045
(gasping)

08:32.045 --> 08:33.213
Kurt.

08:33.213 --> 08:34.347
Jane?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.616
Kurt.. what the hell
is happening?

08:36.616 --> 08:38.451
I... don't know.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.553
But I think
you're in trouble.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.526
(gasps)

08:46.526 --> 08:49.162
I... I know this place.

08:50.797 --> 08:53.366
Why does it
feel so different?

08:53.366 --> 08:55.935
(Kurt)
I don't know.

08:55.935 --> 08:59.105
I think you're
under attack.

09:00.607 --> 09:01.908
Attack?

09:03.343 --> 09:04.544
From who?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.279
(static)

09:30.737 --> 09:32.005
From her.

09:47.954 --> 09:49.556
(Weller)
How's she doing?

09:49.556 --> 09:51.491
(Williams)
As you can see,
these red "Remi" synapses

09:51.491 --> 09:54.461
are still firing in the vast
majority of Jane's brain.

09:54.461 --> 09:55.929
Yeah, we're
calling those Cobra,

09:55.929 --> 09:58.798
but the blue, G.I. Jane,
is starting to make a comeback.

09:58.798 --> 10:00.467
How long does she
have to be under?

10:00.467 --> 10:01.968
(Patterson)
It's hard to say.

10:01.968 --> 10:03.470
We can't fire all
the synapses at once.

10:03.470 --> 10:06.072
We need to slow fire them
at perfect intervals

10:06.072 --> 10:08.641
until Jane's brain relearns
how to do it on its own.

10:08.641 --> 10:10.977
So that's it--
these machines decide

10:10.977 --> 10:12.745
whether or not I get
my wife back?

10:12.745 --> 10:15.381
No, they are essentially
a prolonged jumpstart

10:15.381 --> 10:16.950
until these lost connections

10:16.950 --> 10:19.052
learn how
to rebuild themselves.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.920
The machines can't
do it on their own.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.056
Jane needs to fight
with everything she's got

10:23.056 --> 10:24.357
to get control of her brain...

10:24.357 --> 10:26.826
(Jane and Patterson)
...back from Remi.

10:26.826 --> 10:28.595
Your brain?

10:28.595 --> 10:31.865
Yeah. Yes! My brain.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.334
(chuckling)
This, all of it, the...

10:34.334 --> 10:37.170
We're inside of it,
and... and that's Remi.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.539
She's the one who's
taken it from me.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.241
I have to find her.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.910
If she stays,
I lose everything.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.045
I have to take it back.

10:54.954 --> 10:56.756
(grunts, panting)

11:01.327 --> 11:02.295
Uhh!

11:03.763 --> 11:06.065
(Weller)
I guess it's
not that easy.

11:12.639 --> 11:13.806
(Jane)
It's a puzzle.

11:13.806 --> 11:15.875
(Weller)
So where do we start?

11:15.875 --> 11:17.443
I don't know, I...

11:17.443 --> 11:20.780
I remember you, but there's
so many missing pieces.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.348
I barely know who I am.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.885
How am I supposed to know
how to get out of this room?

11:25.885 --> 11:27.754
I need help!

11:28.788 --> 11:30.323
We're defined
by our choices.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.692
(Borden, echoing)
You just don't remember yours.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.295
I got you a coffee
and a tea this morning.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.896
(echoing)
Which would you prefer?

11:36.896 --> 11:38.197
What are they?

11:38.197 --> 11:39.232
A memory.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.340
(grunts)

11:47.340 --> 11:49.442
This one tastes like
grass trimmings.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.346
My bad.
This one's mine.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.380
Reade?

11:54.380 --> 11:56.382
Whoa. Take it easy.
Hot beverage.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.417
Oh, heh.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.751
Nice to see you,
too, Jane.

11:58.751 --> 12:00.787
All right, what do we got?

12:00.787 --> 12:02.522
Well, we're trying
to get out of this room.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.324
Cheers to that.

12:13.299 --> 12:14.734
(Patterson)
Do you know what a tangram is?

12:14.734 --> 12:15.935
No.

12:15.935 --> 12:17.937
It's a dissection puzzle
consisting of...

12:17.937 --> 12:19.339
...flat geometric pieces.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.807
Exactly.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.876
This team
has been one shape

12:23.876 --> 12:25.211
for a very long time.

12:25.211 --> 12:28.915
But we will find
our new shape.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.660
(Rich)
Ah, tut-tut-tut-tut...

12:40.660 --> 12:41.894
Wouldn't do that
if I were you.

12:41.894 --> 12:44.130
Hi, Rich.
May I?

12:44.130 --> 12:45.498
Okay, now I need you to
hold this thing very still

12:45.498 --> 12:48.001
and about an inch forward
from the wall.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.236
If we remove the painting
from the wall

12:50.236 --> 12:53.206
without disengaging the four
wires tethered behind it,

12:53.206 --> 12:55.842
then a shotgun blast will
fire from behind the canvas,

12:55.842 --> 12:57.543
destroying it...
(snip)

12:57.543 --> 13:00.079
...and putting a whole bunch of
new holes in your face, so...

13:00.079 --> 13:03.616
Okay, go for it.
Go ahead.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.851
(gasps and laughs)

13:04.851 --> 13:07.120
All right.
Look at that.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.821
And, hey, nobody got shot.

13:10.823 --> 13:11.824
Whew.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.526
(gunshot)

13:13.526 --> 13:14.794
(Jane gasping)

13:17.463 --> 13:18.831
It's a clean shot.

13:18.831 --> 13:20.533
Zapata!

13:20.533 --> 13:22.135
Wh-What are you doing?

13:22.135 --> 13:23.302
Helping.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.971
I don't think that's
particularly helpful.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.906
I think you should look up
the meaning of that word.

13:26.906 --> 13:28.408
I love you.

13:29.742 --> 13:32.378
You should...
get that looked at.

13:43.189 --> 13:45.958
It needs both of us
to work.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.529
(faint pinging)

13:51.831 --> 13:52.965
(pinging)

14:10.883 --> 14:12.952
You solved it.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.956
We solved it...
together.

14:16.956 --> 14:19.692
The more I remember,
the stronger I get.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.594
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go get 'em, tiger.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.032
(stammering)

14:26.032 --> 14:27.467
You guys aren't coming?

14:27.467 --> 14:29.402
I'm only Jane
because of you.

14:29.402 --> 14:32.071
I mean, I really gotta
clean this stuff up.

14:32.071 --> 14:33.339
I got a lot of paperwork
to get through.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.875
I would like to,
but I'm... frightened.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.210
I really don't want to.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.480
You guys can't
go out there, can you?

14:40.480 --> 14:43.282
We'll always be here
when you need us.

14:44.484 --> 14:45.852
Come on, let's go.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.554
All right.
Let's move.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.290
Good luck.

14:51.290 --> 14:53.359
Why is it so dark
out here?

14:53.359 --> 14:54.827
I'm sick.

14:54.827 --> 14:56.863
It must be
getting worse.

14:58.164 --> 15:00.666
What's wrong?
Nothing. Come on.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.506
I'm gonna try
to stay with you.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.841
I don't think Remi
wants you to remember me.

15:08.841 --> 15:11.644
She wants you scared,
alone.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.548
Which way do we go?

15:15.548 --> 15:17.083
That way.

15:20.119 --> 15:23.022
I think I'll pass on that.

15:23.022 --> 15:26.058
Okay... that way.

15:29.829 --> 15:31.164
Come on.

15:38.237 --> 15:39.438
Come on, come on.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.207
Are you sure this
is the right way?

15:41.207 --> 15:42.608
(elevator bell chimes)

15:45.478 --> 15:48.114
What? Coin slot?

15:48.114 --> 15:49.982
What am I supposed
to do with--

15:49.982 --> 15:52.451
No, no!
No! No! Please!

15:52.451 --> 15:54.053
Kurt!

15:54.053 --> 15:56.422
No! No!

15:58.691 --> 16:02.962
(alarm trilling)

16:02.962 --> 16:04.630
What's happening?
What's changed?

16:04.630 --> 16:05.598
I don't know.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.466
(Williams)
She's at war with herself.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.668
And Jane's losing.

16:16.075 --> 16:17.643
Come on, Jane.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.083
(grunting)

16:27.820 --> 16:29.522
(rattling)

16:40.933 --> 16:43.603
Who are you?
What do you want?

16:45.605 --> 16:48.341
(faint laughter)

16:48.341 --> 16:51.210
(growling and clanking)

16:54.180 --> 16:56.649
(door banging)

16:58.985 --> 17:00.353
(growling)

17:03.856 --> 17:06.259
(door banging)

17:11.697 --> 17:13.799
(girl screams)

17:14.934 --> 17:17.336
Hey! It's me.
Hey, Jane!

17:17.336 --> 17:18.771
(gasping)
Yeah.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.072
Look at me.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.045
Just breathe.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.680
It's okay.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.382
Just breathe.

17:29.382 --> 17:33.019
Keeping you scared
is how Remi keeps control.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.787
You have to fight
that fear.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.989
You can be hunted...

17:36.989 --> 17:39.825
or... you can
be the hunter.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.702
It's not invincible.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.604
I have an idea.

17:54.173 --> 17:55.775
Kurt?

18:06.552 --> 18:07.486
(gasps)

18:09.956 --> 18:11.691
(panting)

18:27.106 --> 18:28.341
(static)

18:28.341 --> 18:29.608
(man grunts)

18:30.876 --> 18:32.611
(man panting and snarling)

18:33.980 --> 18:36.048
Who are you?

18:36.048 --> 18:38.784
(bones cracking)

18:41.520 --> 18:42.321
(gasps)

18:42.321 --> 18:43.623
(high-pitched tone)

18:43.623 --> 18:44.991
How long have we
known each other for?

18:44.991 --> 18:46.826
A very long time.

18:46.826 --> 18:47.860
No!

18:47.860 --> 18:49.261
Do it!

18:51.597 --> 18:52.932
Roman?

18:52.932 --> 18:56.602
(raspy breathing)

18:58.170 --> 19:00.006
What do you want?

19:00.006 --> 19:03.275
(grunting and snarling)

19:05.144 --> 19:07.480
I want you here with me!

19:07.480 --> 19:09.648
(growls)
In the dark!

19:09.648 --> 19:13.052
I want you to feel...
what I feel.

19:13.052 --> 19:15.354
If you want me...

19:15.354 --> 19:16.856
come and get me!

19:18.024 --> 19:20.226
(growls)

19:26.298 --> 19:28.100
(Roman grunting)

19:28.100 --> 19:29.235
Now!

19:30.970 --> 19:32.371
Gaaah!

19:33.873 --> 19:36.442
How do I get
to Remi?

19:36.442 --> 19:38.411
(raspy breathing,
chuckles)

19:39.912 --> 19:41.981
You don't wanna fight me.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.783
I always win.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.851
No... you don't.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.354
(Shepherd)
Another win for Remi.

19:58.497 --> 20:01.300
I wonder what'll happen
when you lose.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.568
Nothing good.

20:04.970 --> 20:07.406
Wait, what...

20:07.406 --> 20:10.076
Why did I choose this?

20:10.076 --> 20:12.144
You played this
with Remi, not me.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.646
Excellent question.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.384
How do I get to Remi?

20:18.384 --> 20:20.553
We're not finished yet.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.656
Until we are,
you can't move--

20:23.656 --> 20:25.491
(groans)

20:25.491 --> 20:27.359
You're still bleeding.

20:27.359 --> 20:29.695
Doesn't seem to want to stop.

20:30.796 --> 20:32.698
I'm sorry.

20:32.698 --> 20:35.134
For what,
not killing me yourself?

20:35.134 --> 20:37.103
(marbles rattle)

20:37.103 --> 20:39.305
For not protecting you.

20:40.473 --> 20:43.209
From our parents' deaths,
from...

20:43.209 --> 20:45.711
Crawford's orphanage,
from Shepherd.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.281
From me.

20:49.281 --> 20:50.616
Uhh!

20:54.587 --> 20:56.088
You really did
a number on me.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.990
I was trying
to save you.

20:57.990 --> 21:02.194
To give you the chance
I got for a fresh start, I--

21:02.194 --> 21:03.529
I didn't know
it would kill you.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.798
Well, technically,
it didn't, remember?

21:11.837 --> 21:13.272
Anyway, how could
you have known

21:13.272 --> 21:15.341
the ZIP was poison?

21:15.341 --> 21:17.443
Shepherd didn't tell us.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.712
I should have gotten us
away from her.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.381
There was never
a way out of that.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.318
Anyway, none of that
matters now.

21:26.318 --> 21:28.320
It matters to me.

21:31.190 --> 21:33.259
Okay.

21:33.259 --> 21:34.994
I forgive you.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.666
(crying)
I miss you.

21:42.401 --> 21:45.604
You're the only one
who really knows me.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.541
All of me.

21:48.541 --> 21:52.111
No... there's another.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.079
Who?

21:55.347 --> 21:57.049
Kurt?

21:58.884 --> 22:00.486
You really remember
all that stuff

22:00.486 --> 22:01.954
from when we were kids?

22:01.954 --> 22:03.856
(muffled laughter)

22:05.324 --> 22:06.625
Yes.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.862
That was Remi's life.

22:11.597 --> 22:13.632
What does that mean?

22:15.334 --> 22:16.802
You win.

22:23.375 --> 22:25.644
Hey...
I got you something.

22:27.446 --> 22:29.582
(gasps)

22:29.582 --> 22:30.916
Good-bye, sis.

22:38.557 --> 22:39.825
(Weller)
Did you get what you need?

22:42.962 --> 22:44.129
I think so.

22:44.129 --> 22:45.764
Good.

22:45.764 --> 22:47.833
It's time to get Remi out
once and for all.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.937
What's wrong?

22:51.937 --> 22:53.739
I don't know.

22:53.739 --> 22:56.375
I still don't think
I'm ready.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.509
Roman...

22:57.509 --> 22:59.478
Hey...

22:59.478 --> 23:00.813
You can do this.

23:10.956 --> 23:12.558
(coin rattles)

23:12.558 --> 23:15.995
(clanking and whirring)

23:15.995 --> 23:18.530
What's happening?
Wait, why is it going down?

23:24.536 --> 23:25.938
Why is it going down?

23:25.938 --> 23:27.306
You said Remi
was above us.

23:27.306 --> 23:29.341
She is!
So where is it taking us?

23:29.341 --> 23:31.577
(loud clatter)

23:33.746 --> 23:35.914
(Shepherd, distant)
I'm your mother.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.117
I'm your mother.
I'm your mother.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.184
(bell chimes)

23:48.494 --> 23:51.163
(Weller grunting)

23:51.163 --> 23:52.131
No!

23:56.135 --> 23:57.903
Hello, Jane.

23:57.903 --> 24:00.205
You remember me,
don't you?

24:01.407 --> 24:03.776
Memories can be
a dangerous thing.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.478
I'm not here for you.

24:06.478 --> 24:08.180
I'm here for Remi.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.348
(chuckling)

24:09.348 --> 24:10.983
You'll never
defeat her.

24:10.983 --> 24:14.353
I built her
to be unbeatable.

24:14.353 --> 24:15.688
My advice?

24:15.688 --> 24:18.424
You should go back
to solving puzzles in the lab

24:18.424 --> 24:20.559
with your little friends.

24:20.559 --> 24:22.828
That's what
you were built for.

24:22.828 --> 24:25.931
You expect me
to roll over...

24:25.931 --> 24:28.334
while Remi steals
my life from me?

24:28.334 --> 24:30.502
I want my memories back.

24:30.502 --> 24:31.637
They're mine.

24:31.637 --> 24:34.173
You have no idea
what you're chasing.

24:34.173 --> 24:35.174
(Shepherd)
Strap her in!

24:35.174 --> 24:36.375
No... no!

24:36.375 --> 24:38.243
Get away from me!

24:38.243 --> 24:39.578
(Jane panting)

24:40.813 --> 24:42.881
You want to remember?

24:42.881 --> 24:44.850
Then remember all of it.

24:47.052 --> 24:48.620
(muffled gunshots)

24:52.658 --> 24:54.126
(Shepherd)
You think remembering

24:54.126 --> 24:55.461
is so wonderful?

24:55.461 --> 24:58.630
Look at how much pain
you felt.

24:58.630 --> 25:01.700
How much pain
you've caused.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.869
(indistinct voices)

25:03.869 --> 25:07.339
(Mayfair)
You lied to all of us!

25:07.339 --> 25:09.308
(whispering)
I'm sorry.

25:09.308 --> 25:10.476
(grunting)

25:10.476 --> 25:11.710
(Avery)
You abandoned me!

25:11.710 --> 25:13.545
(indistinct voices)

25:16.215 --> 25:17.750
(Weller)
Don't!

25:17.750 --> 25:19.318
(Roman)
There's a place in your mind

25:19.318 --> 25:20.786
no one can get to.

25:20.786 --> 25:22.721
A place that belongs
only to you.

25:22.721 --> 25:25.524
No matter what they say,
no matter what they do,

25:25.524 --> 25:27.126
no one can reach you there.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.962
Pain... is a dream.

25:32.664 --> 25:35.734
Pain is a dream.

25:35.734 --> 25:39.104
No... how is
she doing that?

25:39.104 --> 25:41.540
This isn't
supposed to happen!

25:41.540 --> 25:44.042
(Jane)
I remember...

25:50.349 --> 25:52.251
We aren't done.

25:52.251 --> 25:53.752
Not by a long shot.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.956
Uhh!

26:00.959 --> 26:05.531
(Weller)
Help! Jane! Help me!

26:05.531 --> 26:08.700
Jane!
Jane, I need you!

26:11.270 --> 26:13.839
The FBI doesn't negotiate
with terrorists.

26:15.374 --> 26:16.608
(Jane grunting)

26:16.608 --> 26:18.877
(gunshots)

26:21.513 --> 26:23.916
We have to get to Remi.
Come on!

26:27.753 --> 26:30.289
(Weller)
Jane! Help me!

26:30.289 --> 26:31.957
Help me!

26:33.158 --> 26:34.693
Damn it. Kurt!

26:36.695 --> 26:38.363
Kurt!

26:38.363 --> 26:39.832
Jane!
(panting)

26:39.832 --> 26:42.134
Get me out
of this thing.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.769
I don't understand.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.871
What am I doing wrong?
Why does this keep happening?

26:45.871 --> 26:47.239
This bomb can only
be defused

26:47.239 --> 26:48.874
by removing
the trigger trip,

26:48.874 --> 26:51.109
but it's protected by
an anti-tamper device.

26:51.109 --> 26:53.111
So you need to reach
inside this tube,

26:53.111 --> 26:55.647
remove the cap,
and pull it out.

26:55.647 --> 26:56.915
But it's asymmetrical.

26:56.915 --> 26:58.617
I need you to twist
and turn it

26:58.617 --> 27:00.819
to avoid the contact
points, okay?

27:02.888 --> 27:04.756
What are you doing?
Come on.

27:04.756 --> 27:06.625
Jane! We're running
out of time!

27:07.526 --> 27:09.161
No, this is never
gonna stop.

27:09.161 --> 27:10.829
She's just gonna
keep doing this

27:10.829 --> 27:13.298
over and over,
holding us here.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.000
Who is?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.235
Remi.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.504
She's using you
to keep me away from her.

27:18.504 --> 27:20.739
She knows I'm never gonna
stop trying to save you.

27:20.739 --> 27:21.874
So save me!

27:21.874 --> 27:24.409
Jane, get me out
of this thing.

27:24.409 --> 27:26.745
Except, you're
not really you.

27:26.745 --> 27:28.180
What?

27:28.180 --> 27:29.581
What are you
talking about, Jane?

27:29.581 --> 27:30.649
I am me!

27:30.649 --> 27:33.252
No.
No, you're me.

27:33.252 --> 27:36.388
Which means I'm the only one
with the power to stop this.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.257
So stop it, Jane.

27:38.257 --> 27:39.625
(countdown beeping)

27:39.625 --> 27:42.494
Please...
don't do this.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.762
I'm sorry, Kurt.

27:43.762 --> 27:44.863
Please, don't.

27:44.863 --> 27:46.532
I'll see you
when I wake up.

27:46.532 --> 27:47.933
The real you.

27:47.933 --> 27:49.768
I think I have to
do this part alone.

27:49.768 --> 27:51.703
Don't.
Jane...

27:51.703 --> 27:53.038
I'm sorry.

27:53.038 --> 27:54.273
Jane!

27:54.273 --> 27:56.041
Jane!
(beeping continues)

27:57.409 --> 27:58.977
Jane!

28:08.654 --> 28:11.023
(sobbing)

28:16.795 --> 28:19.164
(alarm beeping)

28:19.164 --> 28:20.365
(Weller)
Something's wrong!

28:20.365 --> 28:21.433
Shut it down.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.035
Shut it down now, please.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.403
We can't.
If we unplug her,

28:24.403 --> 28:26.038
she's either gonna be
dead or a vegetable.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.539
Rich...
He's right.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.707
There's no way back now.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.108
(Patterson)
I'm sorry, Kurt.

28:30.108 --> 28:32.477
Jane has to fight
this battle on her own now.

28:32.477 --> 28:34.413
(beeping continues)

28:40.485 --> 28:44.022
(Jane panting)

28:44.022 --> 28:46.358
(light bulbs popping)

28:56.802 --> 28:58.236
(rattles door)

29:06.011 --> 29:07.145
(panel beeps)

29:08.580 --> 29:10.482
No.

29:10.482 --> 29:11.950
(rattles door)

29:11.950 --> 29:13.785
No.
Open the door.

29:13.785 --> 29:16.021
Good-bye, Jane.

29:21.627 --> 29:23.428
Hello?

29:23.428 --> 29:27.265
Patterson? Reade?
Rich? Zapata?

29:27.265 --> 29:29.201
You said you'd always be here
when I need you.

29:34.272 --> 29:35.440
Fine.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.143
Fine, I guess I just
have to do it on my own.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.079
Or do I?

29:44.116 --> 29:48.320
Okay... what would the team do
if they were here?

29:49.388 --> 29:50.922
That handprint
from the scanner.

29:50.922 --> 29:52.524
Why was it so familiar?

29:53.592 --> 29:54.926
It's another puzzle.

29:54.926 --> 29:56.828
Okay, Reade would tell
Rich and Patterson

29:56.828 --> 29:58.230
to start digging in,

29:58.230 --> 30:01.133
and that would
remind Patterson of something.

30:02.868 --> 30:04.169
(typing)
And then they would start

30:04.169 --> 30:05.437
looking at codes and ciphers

30:05.437 --> 30:08.106
related to hands
and fingerprints.

30:08.106 --> 30:10.042
Then they would notice
something.

30:10.042 --> 30:13.078
That same weird hand appears
four times on my body.

30:13.078 --> 30:14.613
They'd get an idea.

30:14.613 --> 30:17.416
They would get an idea,
and they would...

30:17.416 --> 30:18.884
map the body like a grid

30:18.884 --> 30:20.552
and overlay
the four hand tattoos.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.621
The letters that appear
in the same position

30:22.621 --> 30:25.924
on all four tattoos
are the ones to isolate.

30:25.924 --> 30:28.260
It's all scrambled.

30:28.260 --> 30:31.029
You said you'd always
be here.

30:31.029 --> 30:33.265
Wait a second...
what if that's the cipher?

30:33.265 --> 30:36.168
"We'll always be here
when you need us."

30:36.168 --> 30:38.203
(beeping)
Huh.

30:38.203 --> 30:41.006
"Alice Through
the Looking Glass."

30:47.212 --> 30:48.680
(Jane)
What is that?

30:48.680 --> 30:49.715
It's Taylor's.

30:49.715 --> 30:51.850
Taylor Shaw's doll?

30:53.118 --> 30:55.620
Is that the answer?

30:55.620 --> 30:57.456
Taylor... Shaw...

30:57.456 --> 30:58.657
(beep)

30:58.657 --> 31:01.426
Uh... Jane.

31:01.426 --> 31:02.661
(beep)

31:02.661 --> 31:04.496
(sighs)
Remi?

31:04.496 --> 31:05.997
(beep)

31:07.332 --> 31:10.469
Your real name
is Alice Kruger.

31:10.469 --> 31:11.837
Alice...

31:11.837 --> 31:13.505
(beep beep)

31:13.505 --> 31:16.208
Ah!
It's me.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.177
Before I was Remi
or Jane.

31:19.177 --> 31:23.048
You're-- you're me before
anything bad happened.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.783
You're Alice Kruger.

31:38.797 --> 31:40.198
(panel trilling)

31:41.633 --> 31:42.968
(chirps)

31:42.968 --> 31:45.971
(door unlocks)

31:48.874 --> 31:53.612
Well, if it isn't
Jane Doe, FBI.

31:54.679 --> 31:56.081
It's time for you to go.

31:56.081 --> 31:59.050
You wanna kill me?
Be my guest.

32:05.857 --> 32:07.359
Uhh!
(high-pitched tone)

32:07.359 --> 32:09.194
(grunting)

32:09.194 --> 32:11.663
That's what I thought.

32:11.663 --> 32:12.597
(Jane grunting)

32:16.434 --> 32:17.736
(Williams)
Temperature's spiking.

32:17.736 --> 32:19.471
Blood pressure,
respiratory rate dropping.

32:19.471 --> 32:20.872
Heart rate's
completely erratic.

32:20.872 --> 32:22.974
She's been under
too long.

32:22.974 --> 32:24.709
Come on, Jane.

32:24.709 --> 32:25.944
(alarm beeping)

32:25.944 --> 32:29.347
Jane. Jane!
Don't give up.

32:29.347 --> 32:30.782
I never gave up
on you.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.517
Don't you
give up on me.

32:33.585 --> 32:34.619
(grunts)

32:37.823 --> 32:39.591
(both grunting)

32:46.331 --> 32:47.966
Do it!
Kill her!

32:49.801 --> 32:51.736
You think
you're so righteous?

32:51.736 --> 32:54.072
That you deserve this?

32:54.072 --> 32:56.508
(groaning)

32:58.977 --> 33:00.478
You were nothing
but a device,

33:00.478 --> 33:03.815
a vessel, so that
we could get what we want.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.383
(grunts)

33:11.022 --> 33:13.058
You're not a person.

33:13.058 --> 33:14.726
You're a blip.

33:14.726 --> 33:16.428
An anomaly
on a brain scan.

33:16.428 --> 33:19.197
Besides,
I was here first.

33:19.197 --> 33:22.434
(Jane panting)

33:22.434 --> 33:26.404
No, you weren't.
Alice was.

33:26.404 --> 33:30.976
And you're not the enemy.
Shepherd is.

33:30.976 --> 33:32.143
She did this to us.

33:32.143 --> 33:35.413
Keeping you alone...
suspicious,

33:35.413 --> 33:37.449
wielding you
like a weapon,

33:37.449 --> 33:40.719
filling you
with fear and hate.

33:40.719 --> 33:44.089
(scoffs)
Nice try.

33:44.089 --> 33:46.591
But if I'm alone
then so are you.

33:46.591 --> 33:48.159
No.
No, I'm not.

33:48.159 --> 33:49.494
(monitors buzzing)

33:49.494 --> 33:51.730
I have something
Shepherd never gave us.

33:51.730 --> 33:54.566
People who care about me.

33:54.566 --> 33:57.402
Who are there for me
whenever I need them.

34:02.440 --> 34:04.576
(Shepherd)
Give it up.

34:04.576 --> 34:08.146
Walk away...
or I kill the girl.

34:08.146 --> 34:11.182
(scoffs)
It's too late.

34:11.182 --> 34:13.485
You already did.

34:19.190 --> 34:22.160
No... there's another.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.463
This wasn't your fault.

34:25.463 --> 34:28.600
And I'm not here
to defeat you.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.168
I'm here to make peace
with you.

34:30.168 --> 34:32.270
Peace?

34:32.270 --> 34:35.607
We're not as different
as you think we are.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.309
We were both
that little girl once

34:37.309 --> 34:40.779
before Shepherd took that
away from us.

34:40.779 --> 34:42.013
I'm nothing like you.

34:42.013 --> 34:43.415
No, you're wrong.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.183
I remember what you did
when you were out there

34:45.183 --> 34:46.718
pretending to be me.

34:46.718 --> 34:50.088
I remember the bad,
and I remember the good.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.090
All the lives you saved.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.626
Strategy...
to buy their trust.

34:54.626 --> 34:57.462
Did you hear what I said?
I said I remember.

34:57.462 --> 35:01.299
We are the same,
two sides of one coin.

35:01.299 --> 35:03.368
But we can't be free until
we break her hold on us

35:03.368 --> 35:04.636
once and for all.

35:09.140 --> 35:10.642
And how do we do that?

35:10.642 --> 35:13.244
Remi, don't listen
to her.

35:13.244 --> 35:16.614
Together.
You and me.

35:16.614 --> 35:19.484
You don't have to be
what she says you are.

35:19.484 --> 35:21.953
And you don't
have to be alone.

35:21.953 --> 35:25.023
And whatever you did...

35:25.023 --> 35:29.561
whatever we did...
I forgive you.

35:46.378 --> 35:48.213
(pieces clattering)

36:09.300 --> 36:11.669
(office chatter)

36:22.113 --> 36:23.114
(gasps)

36:23.114 --> 36:24.149
(Weller)
Hey!

36:24.149 --> 36:26.017
(Williams)
We got her.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.287
Jane!
Is it you?

36:29.287 --> 36:31.122
(weakly)
Kurt?

36:31.122 --> 36:34.292
It's me.
It's Jane.

36:36.795 --> 36:38.596
I'm back.

36:45.203 --> 36:48.373
(Jane grunting)

36:49.240 --> 36:51.076
I thought I lost you.

36:51.076 --> 36:53.344
(softly)
I thought I lost me, too.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.447
Oh, here...

36:56.614 --> 37:01.219
I-- I remember...
everything.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.655
My memories and...

37:03.655 --> 37:06.424
Remi's, as bad
as a lot of them are.

37:06.424 --> 37:07.992
But for the first time
in my life,

37:07.992 --> 37:10.428
I feel like
a whole person.

37:11.996 --> 37:13.631
(sniffles)
What?

37:13.631 --> 37:15.366
Shut up, you're crying.

37:15.366 --> 37:17.135
I'll let you guys
catch up.

37:17.135 --> 37:18.837
You helped
bring me back?

37:21.206 --> 37:22.741
It was a team effort.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.743
Thank you.
I'm Jane.

37:25.743 --> 37:28.313
It is nice
to meet you, Jane.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.421
Stay here,
you need to rest.

37:36.421 --> 37:37.655
I'll be back soon.

37:37.655 --> 37:41.292
I broke Shepherd
out of the black site.

37:41.292 --> 37:42.460
When I was-- when I was Remi,
I went and I--

37:42.460 --> 37:44.395
Yeah.
We know.

37:44.395 --> 37:46.765
It's okay.
You weren't yourself.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.166
We'll figure out a way
to explain that

37:48.166 --> 37:49.868
to Weitz and the CIA
when the time is right.

37:49.868 --> 37:52.403
No, no, I mean
I know where she is.

37:52.403 --> 37:54.072
I can take you
to her right now.

37:54.072 --> 37:55.740
No.
No, no, no.

37:55.740 --> 37:58.109
Okay? You've been
through enough already.

37:58.109 --> 38:02.514
So, you tell us the address
and-- and we'll go.

38:02.514 --> 38:04.382
Yeah, I wouldn't
trust me yet, either.

38:04.382 --> 38:05.817
This is all the proof
we need.

38:08.253 --> 38:11.556
You're back.
But, yes, more is better,

38:11.556 --> 38:14.826
and we can run
all of the tests, but...

38:14.826 --> 38:16.761
we should get you
to the hospital right now.

38:16.761 --> 38:18.296
Rich, do you want
to go with her?

38:18.296 --> 38:19.497
You got it.

38:19.497 --> 38:21.232
I will arrange
for the ambulance.

38:21.232 --> 38:25.403
Okay. And, Patterson...
let's go get Shepherd.

38:26.538 --> 38:28.473
(softly)
Kurt...

38:28.473 --> 38:31.409
I'm so sorry.

38:31.409 --> 38:33.111
For everything
I did to you,

38:33.111 --> 38:34.312
for the lies
I told you.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.413
Shh, shh, shh.

38:35.413 --> 38:38.483
It's okay.
Doesn't matter.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.552
You're back...

38:40.552 --> 38:42.153
and I love you.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.955
I love you.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.024
All right.

38:47.892 --> 38:49.027
Get her.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.769
(gate bangs open)

39:04.943 --> 39:06.644
(agent #1)
Clear!

39:06.644 --> 39:08.146
(agent #2)
Clear!

39:08.146 --> 39:09.547
She's gone.

39:09.547 --> 39:12.750
(Patterson sighs)
You don't think...

39:12.750 --> 39:15.220
Jane misremembered,
do you?

39:15.220 --> 39:18.223
Or...
Or what?

39:18.223 --> 39:21.025
Intentionally misled us?
No, I don't.

39:21.025 --> 39:23.595
Now, can you stay here?
Keep working with Forensics.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.063
We need something
that tells us

39:25.063 --> 39:26.764
where Shepherd went.

39:26.764 --> 39:28.566
Security detail
will be taking Jane home

39:28.566 --> 39:30.134
from the hospital soon.

39:30.134 --> 39:31.636
I'm gonna go
and check on her,

39:31.636 --> 39:35.373
see if she remembers anything
that might be useful to us.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.910
(door latch clicking)

39:40.345 --> 39:43.548
Jane?
I'm home.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.751
(both grunting, gunshot)

39:46.751 --> 39:49.621
Where's Remi?
What did you do to her?!

39:49.621 --> 39:51.456
(growling)
She's gone.

39:51.456 --> 39:53.591
I don't believe you!
She'll come for me.

40:05.370 --> 40:07.005
(gunshots)

40:13.344 --> 40:15.113
Are you okay?

40:15.113 --> 40:16.180
I'm fine.

40:16.180 --> 40:17.815
(breathing heavily)

40:17.815 --> 40:19.484
I'm get--
I'm getting

40:19.484 --> 40:21.653
some very mixed signals
from you lately.

40:21.653 --> 40:24.889
Is this any way
to treat your mother?

40:24.889 --> 40:26.658
A mother would never
have done

40:26.658 --> 40:29.894
what you did
to me and Roman.

40:29.894 --> 40:32.930
But you can't
hurt us anymore.

40:32.930 --> 40:36.334
Or anyone else.
It's over.

40:36.334 --> 40:38.503
You lost.

40:38.503 --> 40:40.238
I love you.

40:40.238 --> 40:41.506
(crying)

40:41.506 --> 40:44.809
And your brother...
in my own way.

40:44.809 --> 40:48.880
Maybe that's true,
and maybe it isn't.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.715
I don't even know
if you know.

40:50.715 --> 40:53.851
But everything you did

40:53.851 --> 40:57.655
brought me
to where I am now.

40:57.655 --> 41:00.591
And I like who I am.

41:00.591 --> 41:02.894
(Shepherd gasping)

41:06.597 --> 41:08.232
(exhales)

41:11.069 --> 41:12.937
Good-bye, Shepherd.

41:19.043 --> 41:21.012
Okay, ready?

41:21.012 --> 41:22.880
Yeah, I am.

41:24.549 --> 41:27.552
He-hey, there she is!

41:27.552 --> 41:28.953
Wow.
How are you feeling?

41:28.953 --> 41:31.255
I'm, um... ahem.

41:31.255 --> 41:32.790
Like a new woman.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.960
The good one.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.830
We saw your CT scan
and your MRI

41:38.830 --> 41:41.733
and your psych eval
and your polygraph.

41:41.733 --> 41:43.568
Welcome back.

41:44.769 --> 41:46.404
(Weller)
And on that note,

41:46.404 --> 41:50.842
I believe this is yours,
Agent Doe.

41:53.845 --> 41:55.113
Okay, this is nice
here, right?

41:55.113 --> 41:56.681
Finally, one big
happy family again.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.349
No more lies,
no more...

41:58.349 --> 41:59.951
(elevator dings)

41:59.951 --> 42:01.219
...drama.

42:01.219 --> 42:02.954
(Reade)
Let's go.

42:16.167 --> 42:18.603
So much for the one big
happy family.

42:54.639 --> 42:56.240
(man)
Greg, move your head.
