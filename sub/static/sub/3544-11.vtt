00:02.160 --> 00:03.730
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.880 --> 00:04.927
Vampire killed my parents.

00:05.160 --> 00:07.003
- Maybe that was you.
- That was all me.

00:07.520 --> 00:11.081
I'm bad, Elena. I am bad for you.
And I'm choosing to let you go.

00:11.320 --> 00:14.449
You think I'm gonna judge you
after I find out you've been tortured?

00:14.680 --> 00:16.364
Stop defending me!

00:16.600 --> 00:18.443
Do you know the reason we're together?

00:18.680 --> 00:22.287
Because Klaus granted us permission
to be together. I can't live like that.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.363
You take one more step, we are done.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.281
I'm dying of old age. Goodbye.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.127
You're Katherine Pierce. Suck it up.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.522
I have an idea
that will keep you alive longer.

00:36.160 --> 00:39.448
You have the ability to keep living
inside someone else's body.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.964
Katherine?

00:45.600 --> 00:47.329
<i>Katherine?</i>

01:22.680 --> 01:23.761
Clear.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.286
Give me 200 joules.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.363
- Charged.
- Ready.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.250
Clear.

02:27.560 --> 02:28.721
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

02:28.880 --> 02:33.090
- I was just speaking with her. She sounded fine.
- The doctors think it was a, uh, heart attack.

02:33.280 --> 02:36.887
Trust me, Katherine Pierce is not
going to die from a heart attack.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.525
Clear.

02:39.640 --> 02:41.608
All right, still no response.

02:45.160 --> 02:46.491
Let's get some O2 on her.

02:46.720 --> 02:47.926
<i>We both know my mother.</i>

02:48.240 --> 02:49.924
- She will fight this.
- She's dying.

02:51.040 --> 02:54.203
Every single organ in
her body is failing...

02:54.440 --> 02:56.408
and vampire blood can't save her.

02:56.600 --> 03:00.685
I compelled the doctors to let me
take her home, so she's more comfortable...

03:00.960 --> 03:04.328
but she's dying. They don't think
she'll survive the rest of the day.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.482
What the hell?

03:41.120 --> 03:43.407
Okay, time to wake up, sleepyhead.

03:43.600 --> 03:47.161
- No. I'm not leaving this bed.
- Which is why we brought breakfast to you.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.251
What's all this?

03:55.440 --> 03:57.329
This is your breakup breakfast.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.367
- My what?
<i>- Damon dumped</i> Elena.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.325
- Why?
- I have no idea.

04:02.520 --> 04:05.444
Who spends two years pining after a girl
to dump her?

04:05.680 --> 04:07.682
I can hear you, dumb-ass.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.924
- So that's it? You're just giving up?
- As she should.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.963
I mean, he did say, and I quote:

04:18.160 --> 04:19.321
"I am a bad person.

04:19.519 --> 04:20.760
I am bad for you.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.849
And I am choosing to let you go."

04:23.040 --> 04:25.042
- You memorized my breakup?
- Of course I did.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.530
Drink this.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.763
So you're sure it was just a fight?

04:43.040 --> 04:44.326
I just have to face reality.

04:44.520 --> 04:47.649
If Damon makes up his mind
about something, it's done.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.290
Yeah.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.801
- It's Stefan.
- Tell him I don't feel like talking.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.163
- She doesn't feel like talking.
- She doesn't feel like talking.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.528
Well, she's gonna wanna talk about this.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.849
Rule number one, think of the worst thing
Katherine has done to you.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.283
Rule number two, toast to the glory
of her impending death.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.848
Rule three, if you come across
something that's worse, which you will...

05:14.360 --> 05:15.725
repeat rules one and two.

05:15.960 --> 05:21.046
She pretended to be buried in a tomb for
145 years while I waited for her lying ass.

05:22.520 --> 05:27.082
Wait. Does that beat pretending to be Elena,
kissing me on the front porch of your house?

05:27.280 --> 05:30.648
- I don't think so.
- I didn't think so either. Damn.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.485
Mm. Quarterback. Go.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.808
- Uh...
- Think on that. Little Gilbert.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.082
- She fed me to Silas and I died.
- Doozy.

05:40.040 --> 05:44.045
Then she made me crash my car into a pole
and left me for dead again.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.406
Double doozy. Drink.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.720
- My sister's dead because of her.
- Yes, she is.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.890
I wouldn't have been in town
to turn Vicki into a vampire...

05:52.120 --> 05:55.920
if I wasn't trying to get Katherine
out of a tomb she wasn't in. Group shot.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.330
Seriously?

05:59.800 --> 06:03.600
- Elena. We were just, uh...
- I know what you're doing. You're cut off.

06:15.120 --> 06:18.966
If anyone is drinking
to Katherine's last days, it's gonna be me.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.761
She impersonated me.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.291
Repeatedly.

06:24.360 --> 06:27.250
Made Aunt Jenna
stab herself in the stomach.

06:27.440 --> 06:30.603
- And cut off Uncle John's fingers.
- He might have deserved that.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.201
Grams died trying
to close the tomb she wasn't in.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.050
Tyler's curse was triggered by her.

06:39.240 --> 06:42.961
Klaus followed her to Mystic Falls,
and because of that we lost Jenna.

06:43.160 --> 06:44.650
And Alaric.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.691
We're gonna need more booze.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.567
She tried to kill me at least twice.

06:53.800 --> 06:57.043
She did kill me.
Although I'm weirdly better off.

06:57.520 --> 07:01.320
They're talking about me, aren't they?

07:01.560 --> 07:03.847
- They're reminiscing.
- It's fine.

07:04.680 --> 07:07.809
I'm sure I deserve
everything that they're saying.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.364
- Does my hand look wrinkled to you?
- It looks fine.

07:12.560 --> 07:15.643
If I start to sag anywhere...

07:15.960 --> 07:21.091
you take a knife and you jam it
into my carotid artery immediately, okay?

07:21.280 --> 07:22.691
Okay.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.565
What?

07:25.400 --> 07:28.529
You know, even on your deathbed,
you're vain.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.411
<i>Hey-</i>

07:30.600 --> 07:34.571
If a girl's gotta go,
I may as well be glamorous, right?

07:38.360 --> 07:41.011
That's definitely an age spot.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.886
This is not an age spot, Katherine.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.405
You're being too nice to me.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.371
- Why?
- You're dying.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.445
I think I can muster up
a little bit of compassion.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.044
Nadia?

08:22.080 --> 08:23.241
Shh.

08:28.840 --> 08:31.684
Rumor has it she burned down
the entire city of Atlanta once.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.690
- That might win.
- Knock it off or take it somewhere else.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.246
- You guys are being insensitive.
- Come on, Stefan.

08:37.440 --> 08:41.410
Don't let the sight of a frail,
human Elena lookalike...

08:41.600 --> 08:45.321
cloud your memories
of the manipulative psycho that she is.

08:48.040 --> 08:49.451
In 1864...

08:49.960 --> 08:53.681
Katherine moved into my home, compelled
me to love her, seduced my brother...

08:53.920 --> 08:57.891
fed us full of vampire blood, and started
a war with the town that got us killed.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.003
Exactly. Bottoms up.

09:00.480 --> 09:01.970
But centuries before that...

09:02.120 --> 09:04.646
she was just an innocent girl
who was shunned by her family.

09:04.840 --> 09:08.083
So for 500 years, she
lied and manipulated...

09:08.280 --> 09:12.444
and did whatever she had to do to survive.
And she did. She's a survivor. Right?

09:12.640 --> 09:15.405
So that's the girl that
I will drink to today.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.284
Cheers.

09:17.840 --> 09:20.969
Please. One night of hot sex with her
and you're brainwashed?

09:21.200 --> 09:22.645
- What?
- What?

09:22.840 --> 09:24.888
Oh, my. I forgot to tell you.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.168
You were kidnapped, and hostaged, and...

09:28.400 --> 09:29.447
Bottle's empty, I...

09:29.720 --> 09:33.327
That's why you never send a busboy
to do a man's job.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.845
Nadia. The devil's spawn.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.806
Hey, Caroline,
did you remember to tell Elena that?

09:41.080 --> 09:43.481
I think my mind just exploded. Okay.

09:43.720 --> 09:44.801
Katherine's upstairs.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.368
Actually, I'm here to see all of you.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.287
I've found a way to save my mother...

09:51.520 --> 09:53.090
- ...and I need some help.
- Uh-uh.

09:53.240 --> 09:57.484
No way. Even my biased brother knows I
will kick his ass from here to Kentucky...

09:57.680 --> 10:01.366
if he helps Katherine Pierce live
one more day on this Earth. No volunteers.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.001
I figured as much.

10:03.240 --> 10:07.165
Which is why I found that old safe your
brother spent the summer drowning in...

10:07.640 --> 10:09.768
and buried it on this property...

10:10.000 --> 10:12.970
with your friend Matt inside of it.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.848
Oh, without this.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.206
What?

10:25.720 --> 10:28.883
I figured you two would be my volunteers.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.166
Congratulations on your intuition.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.845
We're here.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.371
We volunteered.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.050
Now, tell us where Matt is.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.363
Matt will be freed
once you help me get what I need.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.891
- Which is what, exactly?
- I need a Traveler.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.442
Katherine was born
into a Traveler bloodline.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.484
She can make herself be a passenger
in someone else's body...

10:50.680 --> 10:53.001
if a Traveler teaches her how to do it.

10:53.200 --> 10:56.044
Like your boyfriend Gregor
hopped a ride in Matt's body?

10:56.560 --> 10:58.767
Until Katherine killed him, of course.

10:59.320 --> 11:04.008
Your mother killed your boyfriend.
Why are we saving her again?

11:04.200 --> 11:07.249
- Gregor was gonna kill her. Protecting herself.
- Don't defend her.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.210
- Especially now that you've...
- Now that I've slept with her?

11:10.400 --> 11:12.767
I'm sure you have plenty to say about that.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.404
We're here.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.726
So we're just supposed to help you...

11:22.920 --> 11:25.366
let Katherine take over someone's life?

11:25.560 --> 11:27.210
Not just anyone's life.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.204
Mine.

11:30.880 --> 11:33.486
I'm going to make her
a passenger in my body.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.929
I don't see any freshly dug ground.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.770
This property is massive.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.442
Hello? ls no one gonna comment on the fact
that Stefan slept with Katherine?

11:45.640 --> 11:47.085
That's kind of a big deal.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.443
Does it matter? We've all slept
with our fair share of bad choices.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.529
- No offense taken.
- Wait, no.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.762
Obviously not you.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.324
Bonnie Bennett.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.325
Wait, did you two...?

12:02.920 --> 12:04.331
And you didn't tell me?

12:04.760 --> 12:06.330
I didn't think I was obligated.

12:07.280 --> 12:09.123
Of course you were obligated.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.085
You're my best friend.
Does Elena know her little brother...?

12:12.280 --> 12:13.441
- No.
- No.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.649
Ah! Scandalous sex. Even better.

12:17.640 --> 12:21.565
Ugh, God, how am I the only person
on the planet not having scandalous sex?

12:21.800 --> 12:25.964
- Why don't we split up and think about that?
- Good idea. We'll cover more ground that way.

12:51.360 --> 12:54.011
No. No, no, no, Mama.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.522
No. No.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.966
What a mess.

13:07.200 --> 13:10.886
- Damon?
- Okay, I'll say it. I miss Klaus.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.367
I mean, the way this guy
used to torture you.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.364
Sword in the daddy.

13:16.840 --> 13:19.411
- Nice touch.
- Get out of my head.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.728
Remind me how this slaughter
went down again?

13:21.880 --> 13:23.370
Oh, right.

13:23.560 --> 13:26.370
Klaus was gonna kill you
in a blood sacrifice.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.244
And you, being you...

13:28.560 --> 13:34.249
ran for the hills, only to come back
and find your entire family...

13:34.400 --> 13:35.731
had been massacred.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.569
So if I'm adding this up right...

13:38.720 --> 13:41.530
your family's
entire death was all your fault.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.846
No. No.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.202
No. No.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.484
Put the pillow down, Damon.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.401
- Liz.
- If you kill her, it's murder.

13:54.640 --> 13:56.881
I'm gonna have to bring
you in, lock you up.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.684
There's all that paperwork.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.449
Every awful thing I've ever done
is linked to her.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.042
She taught me how to kill.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.848
How to enjoy it.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.522
She ruined me.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.166
And I can't take any of that back.

14:16.840 --> 14:20.401
Look at how much control
she still has over you, Damon.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.081
Prove her wrong.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.650
Matt!

14:32.120 --> 14:34.771
Matt, we're coming for you.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.443
Hello, Caroline.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.649
Klaus.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.770
Not exactly the Ritz.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.007
Travelers don't have much.

15:05.240 --> 15:07.607
They're always on the move.

15:09.120 --> 15:12.283
But on the plus side,
sometimes their services can be bought.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.648
- I found one who named the right price.
- You brought them.

15:17.480 --> 15:20.245
Yes, Mia. Are you ready to make the deal?

15:21.320 --> 15:22.446
What's going on?

15:25.280 --> 15:28.124
I have a feeling
the right price for the deal was us.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.967
I'm sorry. But they asked for
doppelgangers. No idea why.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.610
Agh!

15:39.520 --> 15:42.251
Our rings. They're messing with them,
we can't go outside.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.845
Aah!

16:10.520 --> 16:12.761
Sorry, Matt's buried
alive, no time to chat.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.007
You're not even curious as to why I'm here?

16:17.240 --> 16:20.767
I literally just whooshed
at the sight of your face. So no.

16:21.120 --> 16:24.761
Damon informed me that Katerina Petrova
has taken a tragic turn.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.765
So you're here to gloat
over her corpse-to-be.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.050
To delight in the closure
of 500 years of revenge. Great.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.765
Now I'm even less interested.

16:36.840 --> 16:40.162
Well, then, perhaps you'd be
more interested in talking about Tyler.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.283
Is he...? Did you...?

16:42.520 --> 16:47.048
No. I sent him off with little more than a bruised ego.
He really does hate me, poor lad.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.765
Revenge. It eats at him.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.450
I hear you two broke up.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.130
Because I made him choose.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.091
Me or his stupid revenge fantasy.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.401
He chose wrong.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.922
I suggest you learn from his mistakes
and let Katherine die in peace.

17:01.160 --> 17:02.605
Dying sucks enough as it is...

17:02.800 --> 17:05.121
no need to rub anyone's nose in it.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.406
Okay.
Here's the sedatives from the hospital.

17:13.599 --> 17:16.171
- It should help with the pain.
- I don't want them.

17:17.480 --> 17:20.801
They make me weak. And when I'm weak...

17:21.800 --> 17:23.165
he can get in my head.

17:24.839 --> 17:27.525
Okay, suit yourself.
They're right here if you want them.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.325
Still looking for Matt.
Any word from Elena?

17:31.480 --> 17:33.130
We're not on a speaking basis.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.323
Didn't you hear, sheriff?

17:35.520 --> 17:38.171
He was so afraid to dirty her...

17:38.360 --> 17:42.684
white dove feathers
that he let her little wings fly free.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.451
And it was all my fault.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.250
Oops.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.206
That'll shut her up for a while.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.847
How much further
until we reach this Lockwood plantation?

18:18.040 --> 18:19.371
It won't be long now.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.404
We've just entered the
town of Mystic Falls.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.284
Good.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.889
What is it now?

18:33.640 --> 18:36.644
Looks like a gentleman's
having some problems with his carriage.

18:36.840 --> 18:37.887
At this rate...

18:38.080 --> 18:40.367
we won't arrive until sundown.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.801
What does it matter if...?

18:44.600 --> 18:45.647
All right.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.883
Who is that?

18:49.080 --> 18:52.004
He's so handsome.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.609
What do you say, Emily?

19:03.800 --> 19:09.250
Think that gentleman's family would take in
a poor orphan girl from Atlanta?

19:15.840 --> 19:17.001
What the hell was that?

19:17.200 --> 19:20.124
You never heard the real story...

19:20.440 --> 19:22.442
of how I came to meet your brother?

19:23.520 --> 19:28.082
I want to think that this prophecy...

19:28.280 --> 19:32.080
of the universe bringing
the doppelgangers together is absurd.

19:32.280 --> 19:35.489
But the moment that I saw Stefan...

19:36.120 --> 19:38.691
I can't describe it.

19:38.920 --> 19:42.322
The out-of-the-way road, the downed tree...

19:43.000 --> 19:45.367
the broken-down carriage, it just...

19:46.960 --> 19:49.930
It sounded like fate to me.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.964
This isn't awkward.

20:13.360 --> 20:16.523
Guess we probably picked
the wrong day to be in a fight, huh?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.727
I'm sorry, okay?

20:23.680 --> 20:25.170
It's not my place to judge.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.364
Especially after everything
that you've been through.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.002
You don't happen to speak Czech, do you?

20:40.160 --> 20:42.367
Uh, no.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.041
Okay.

20:45.440 --> 20:46.487
Stefan?

20:51.360 --> 20:52.600
It's okay.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.447
I guess he wants
doppelganger blood.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.889
Should we knock his head off?

21:03.640 --> 21:07.645
Depends. If I kill him, do you think
the rest of these boards fall down?

21:07.840 --> 21:09.330
Right.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.921
- Blood it is.
- Yeah.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.245
Why aren't we healing?

21:20.840 --> 21:22.330
Matt!

21:23.680 --> 21:24.920
Matt!

21:28.160 --> 21:30.640
Would you give me the same choice?

21:31.160 --> 21:32.207
What?

21:32.400 --> 21:34.641
Were I to abandon my revenge
against Katerina...

21:34.800 --> 21:37.610
would you offer me
the same choice as Tyler?

21:39.200 --> 21:40.645
I don't know what you mean.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.444
Yes, you do.

21:45.560 --> 21:46.891
You can't do this to me.

21:47.080 --> 21:50.243
You can't just show up and distract me
while my friend is in danger.

21:50.440 --> 21:54.286
While you've been vamping off in all the
wrong directions, I heard Matt's screams.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.721
- Where?
- Don't worry, love. I've got it covered.

21:56.960 --> 22:00.123
Trust me, he'll be quite happy
with his rescuer.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.244
I'm gone not three months,
and look at the trouble you're in.

22:29.720 --> 22:32.121
Just go away.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.441
Don't you think
that you've made your point?

22:35.640 --> 22:36.687
What point?

22:38.320 --> 22:40.004
Like this one?

22:40.360 --> 22:41.930
Jenna?

22:42.600 --> 22:45.729
Remember when you
compelled me to stab myself?

22:45.960 --> 22:48.281
No, no, no! Unh!

22:48.640 --> 22:49.801
Poor Aunt Jenna.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.164
I had to compel her to think that
she walked into that knife.

22:53.360 --> 22:55.362
She was so confused.

22:56.240 --> 22:59.244
- No. No. No more drugs.
- Hello, fingers.

23:00.440 --> 23:01.601
Goodbye, fingers.

23:02.480 --> 23:03.925
Enough.

23:08.600 --> 23:09.965
Elijah.

23:14.280 --> 23:15.406
Katerina.

23:23.280 --> 23:24.930
You're here.

23:29.560 --> 23:32.928
I'm so sorry, did you think that
that was real? Nope.

23:33.120 --> 23:36.442
No one's coming to say goodbye, Katherine,
because no one cares.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.124
I do.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.725
Come on.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.809
Let's get on with this.

23:50.120 --> 23:53.283
Guess it's a good thing
I'm not claustrophobic anymore.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.648
That's what Katherine helped you with.

23:59.080 --> 24:02.163
- The Silas aftermath.
- She did.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.124
Can I just hate her anyway?

24:06.320 --> 24:08.049
You can.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.085
- Thank you.
- But I don't.

24:11.360 --> 24:16.161
I know I should, but for some reason
I keep rooting for her to find peace.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.886
And Katherine's not the only one, you know.

24:19.560 --> 24:22.803
Damon keeps pushing you away
because he hates himself.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.164
Who he is, what he's done.

24:26.840 --> 24:30.481
Just remember that you never gave up on me,
so don't give up on him.

24:31.320 --> 24:33.846
And don't let him
give up on you, either, okay?

24:44.280 --> 24:47.921
So that's it? All you needed
from us was a bucket of blood?

24:55.720 --> 24:57.768
- Let's get out of here.
- Come on.

25:02.440 --> 25:06.445
Repeat the spell so I know
you understand how the passenger works.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.770
- I can't.
- Just say it.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.483
Say it, and it's done.

25:14.680 --> 25:18.287
Your spirit goes inside my body, Mia
will activate it by calling you forth...

25:18.480 --> 25:22.087
- ...and you get to live.
- Can I have a moment with my daughter please?

25:25.520 --> 25:29.570
- I know what you're going to say...
- We don't have time for this.

25:31.560 --> 25:32.721
Nadia.

25:35.080 --> 25:39.165
Letting my father rip you out of my arms...

25:39.360 --> 25:41.567
it was the biggest regret of my life.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.571
I should've fought harder...

25:44.760 --> 25:47.081
to keep you, but I didn't.

25:48.440 --> 25:50.966
So I spent the next 500 years...

25:51.160 --> 25:54.767
making sure that I never made
that mistake again.

25:55.760 --> 25:58.081
I fought for everything.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.441
And in the process...

26:03.120 --> 26:06.806
I had a long, full life.

26:08.440 --> 26:11.364
And I got to know my beautiful daughter.

26:18.280 --> 26:21.921
You've spent the last centuries...

26:22.120 --> 26:23.406
searching for me.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.971
Don't waste another minute on me.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.491
It's your turn to live.

26:33.480 --> 26:34.811
You can't do this.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.410
Let me.

26:38.640 --> 26:42.042
I've made selfish decisions all my life.

26:42.280 --> 26:45.329
Let me do the right thing for once.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.964
Fine.

26:51.960 --> 26:55.328
Then go. Leave me. Drift off into oblivion.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.891
But I will not sit by your side...

27:00.080 --> 27:01.809
and watch you die.

27:27.720 --> 27:30.405
So the quarterback has been saved.

27:30.600 --> 27:31.931
What now?

27:32.080 --> 27:35.050
Don't you have a dying girl to go punish
for all of her sins?

27:35.240 --> 27:38.210
I do, but I won't for you.

27:38.400 --> 27:42.166
So you came all the way to Mystic Falls
just to back off when I ask you to?

27:42.400 --> 27:47.008
No, I came all the way to Mystic Falls to gloat
over a corpse-to-be, as you poetically put it...

27:47.200 --> 27:49.726
but I will leave minus the gloating...

27:50.400 --> 27:53.563
- ...in return for one small thing.
- And what is that?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.525
I want your confession.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.210
My confession?

27:58.200 --> 27:59.361
I didn't do anything.

27:59.560 --> 28:01.483
Confession about what?

28:01.680 --> 28:03.011
Me.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.686
As soon as we're done here,
I'm gonna walk away...

28:07.920 --> 28:09.922
and I'm never coming back.

28:10.440 --> 28:15.287
You'll never again have to look me in the eye,
cover our connection with hostility, revulsion.

28:15.480 --> 28:18.962
You won't have to loathe the darkest parts
of yourself that care for me...

28:19.120 --> 28:20.565
in spite of all I've done.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.808
I will be gone...

28:25.120 --> 28:26.246
and you will be free.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.090
I just...

28:30.960 --> 28:32.769
I want you to be honest with me.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.008
I'm in college.

28:41.760 --> 28:44.240
I'm building a life for myself.

28:44.480 --> 28:47.324
I have plans and a future...

28:47.520 --> 28:51.605
and things that I want, and none of those
things involve you, okay? None of them.

28:51.800 --> 28:54.121
- I see.
- No, you don't, because...

28:54.320 --> 28:56.607
yes, I cover our
connection with hostility...

28:56.800 --> 28:59.087
because, yes, I hate
myself for the truth.

28:59.280 --> 29:02.841
So if you promise to walk away
like you said, and never come back...

29:03.040 --> 29:06.726
then, yes, I will be honest with you.
I will be honest with you...

29:06.920 --> 29:08.843
about what I want.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.688
I will walk away...

29:18.880 --> 29:21.326
and I will never come back.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.086
I promise.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.210
Good.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.724
Ow.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.729
- What the hell happened to you?
- Agh.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.808
In a shocking twist...

30:15.080 --> 30:17.560
Katherine's daughter is a psychopath.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.210
Whoo.

30:19.480 --> 30:22.290
She's all yours.
I had fun messing with her mind all day.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.403
- Damon...
- I know, Stefan, I know.

30:24.600 --> 30:27.206
It's been a rough couple days.
I needed an outlet, okay?

30:42.880 --> 30:44.644
Hi.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.526
These drugs are...

30:50.720 --> 30:52.529
hard-core.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.245
Close your eyes.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.611
I came to say bye.

31:00.720 --> 31:02.961
I wanna see you.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.330
You Will.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.765
So this is the memory you came back to?

31:23.920 --> 31:25.251
A little dark, no?

31:25.480 --> 31:27.721
Damon already had his fun with this one.

31:29.560 --> 31:31.961
This was the worst day of my life.

31:34.920 --> 31:37.446
He said it was my fault.

31:38.760 --> 31:43.448
That I deserve everything bad
that's ever happened to me.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.083
He's right.

31:52.680 --> 31:54.489
He was right, Stefan.

31:55.800 --> 31:58.007
I don't deserve to be loved.

32:03.240 --> 32:05.561
Open your mind to me.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.089
Look at your father.

32:13.320 --> 32:14.765
He's gone.

32:17.680 --> 32:18.806
What are you doing?

32:19.480 --> 32:21.881
You deserve to feel peace.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.011
Mother?

32:28.200 --> 32:31.488
You were a 17-year-old girl, Katherine.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.324
None of this is your fault.

33:23.240 --> 33:25.447
Goodbye, Katherine.

33:26.360 --> 33:27.441
Is she...?

33:29.240 --> 33:31.004
Not yet.

33:32.080 --> 33:34.162
With these drugs...

33:35.040 --> 33:36.610
she won't wake up again.

33:46.760 --> 33:49.764
Yeah, I was in a dark place, Damon.

33:49.960 --> 33:52.440
And Katherine pulled you out of it.

33:52.680 --> 33:54.205
Irony abounds.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.131
Whatever's going on with you and Elena,
you need to fix it.

33:58.560 --> 34:01.131
She's the best thing
that ever happened to you.

34:01.360 --> 34:03.124
Don't you think I know that?

34:05.360 --> 34:07.044
I can't live without her.

34:09.639 --> 34:12.723
But when you think about it,
I'm no better than Katherine.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.130
Elena will be happier without me.

34:20.639 --> 34:23.291
What? I'm being selfless.
Don't give me that look.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.164
I'm not giving you a look.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.164
Katherine freaking Pierce has a
selfless moment. I'm not allowed to?

34:34.360 --> 34:36.442
Fine. Fine.

34:36.639 --> 34:39.324
When I get Elena back
and the whole universe freaks out...

34:39.480 --> 34:42.962
because the fated doppelgangers
are torn apart, just remember, you...

34:43.159 --> 34:46.243
you're the one who pep-talked me
out of doing the right thing...

34:46.440 --> 34:48.329
for the universe and all mankind.

34:50.360 --> 34:52.681
I will keep that in mind.

34:54.520 --> 34:55.681
You do that.

35:02.160 --> 35:04.288
- Hey.
- Hey, where have you been?

35:06.680 --> 35:09.206
In the woods. I got lost.

35:10.520 --> 35:14.525
- So, what are we doing?
- We are waiting for Katherine to bite it.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.365
So this anchor thing...

35:17.520 --> 35:22.526
does it mean that you'll, like, be able
to feel Katherine's death or whatever?

35:22.720 --> 35:24.722
I think so. I mean, she's human...

35:24.920 --> 35:29.562
but she's also a doppelganger
and a Traveler, apparently.

35:29.720 --> 35:32.883
So who else do you see over there?
Anybody I know?

35:33.200 --> 35:34.690
I see lots of people.

35:34.880 --> 35:37.451
My grams. The other witches.

35:40.560 --> 35:41.721
Vicki.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.802
I just don't talk about
it because it's just...

35:46.000 --> 35:47.729
Because it's depressing as hell.

35:50.680 --> 35:53.081
- Tell Matty I love him.
- What's happening?

35:54.200 --> 35:55.565
She's here.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.570
She said she loves you.

36:01.240 --> 36:03.561
Tell him that I watch over him.

36:03.960 --> 36:08.682
And no more knocking around with that blond
Original chick who almost got him killed.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.769
Wait, what's happening?
What am I missing?

36:11.000 --> 36:12.604
Me.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.250
Tyler?

36:16.600 --> 36:20.286
Rebekah says to tell you
I'm her parting gift.

36:23.760 --> 36:25.489
Hey, Care.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.770
Hi.

36:35.240 --> 36:38.289
Have we really gone through
four bottles of bourbon today?

36:39.640 --> 36:41.847
Someone tell these idiots
to lay off the booze.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.606
- Oh, my God.
- Alaric?

36:44.800 --> 36:46.802
- Ric's here?
- Where the hell have you been?

36:47.000 --> 36:49.287
I thought you bailed on
us to go find peace.

36:49.480 --> 36:53.280
Do you honestly think I'd leave
Damon in charge and never look back?

36:53.720 --> 36:56.883
- He's talking about me, isn't he?
- He says you're a dick.

36:59.760 --> 37:00.807
Cheers, buddy.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.889
Cheers.

37:07.320 --> 37:08.401
Katherine.

37:09.160 --> 37:12.164
Ding, dong.
Does that mean the witch is dead?

37:12.400 --> 37:14.050
No.

37:14.480 --> 37:15.720
Uh-uh.

37:15.920 --> 37:17.001
It's too soon.

37:18.640 --> 37:19.721
I can't.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.525
Wow, you really don't wanna die, do you?

37:25.760 --> 37:28.161
I swear, I just heard your heart stop.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.401
Where am I?

37:29.840 --> 37:31.604
Still alive.

37:32.160 --> 37:33.321
Sadly.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.487
I thought I was a goner there for a second.

37:37.680 --> 37:40.160
And I still have unfinished business.

37:41.160 --> 37:42.685
So do I.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.569
I had this whole speech...

37:45.760 --> 37:48.161
that I was preparing to give your...

37:48.360 --> 37:49.850
unconscious body.

37:50.040 --> 37:52.088
Let me guess.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.203
"Hate, loathe...

37:54.360 --> 37:58.365
screw you, die, bitch," et cetera.

37:59.280 --> 38:00.850
Yes.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.689
Plus one more thing.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.608
I forgive you.

38:13.880 --> 38:15.370
You what?

38:15.840 --> 38:17.524
I forgive you.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.722
You weren't born evil.

38:20.320 --> 38:22.163
Your life made you that way.

38:22.400 --> 38:27.042
You lost everyone that you cared about
way too young.

38:27.400 --> 38:31.121
And you didn't have a family
that looked after you.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.884
Sound familiar?

38:34.960 --> 38:36.883
Is this the:

38:37.120 --> 38:41.409
"We're not so different, you and I"
doppelganger speech?

38:41.600 --> 38:43.921
Because I'd be happy to skip it.

38:45.320 --> 38:49.405
I'll save it for the funeral
that we probably won't have for you.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.568
Perfect.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.922
I just wanted to get the
forgiveness part out.

38:57.040 --> 38:58.929
It's a part of me that...

39:00.240 --> 39:02.049
I never wanna lose.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.208
Good for you.

39:07.360 --> 39:10.204
Now, maybe you can help a girl out.

39:11.280 --> 39:13.009
Give me one more syringe.

39:13.760 --> 39:19.164
And if anyone's gonna
plunge a needle in me one last time...

39:19.840 --> 39:22.161
it may as well be you.

39:22.880 --> 39:26.646
Symmetry and all that.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.327
Elena.

39:50.160 --> 39:53.960
Thank you for your forgiveness.

39:59.880 --> 40:01.689
You're welcome.

40:51.360 --> 40:52.441
Hello?

40:58.520 --> 41:00.807
Hello? Are you there?

41:01.720 --> 41:02.767
I'm here.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.121
Talk to me. Did it work?

41:12.480 --> 41:14.050
Of course it worked.

41:14.520 --> 41:17.888
I'm Katherine Pierce. I survive.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.289
I'll see you soon.

41:40.720 --> 41:44.167
Hi. I'm Elena Gilbert.
