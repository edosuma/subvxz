01:36.471 --> 01:38.223
Aah!

01:55.406 --> 01:57.200
No!

02:33.111 --> 02:34.863
Aah!

04:07.288 --> 04:08.540
What do you think?

04:08.624 --> 04:10.626
Hmm.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.712
I don't know.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.672
It's a bit prosaic.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.007
Oh. That means good, right?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.551
No.

04:19.635 --> 04:21.553
Well, screw you, Banksy.

04:21.637 --> 04:23.514
And you spelled "patriarchy" wrong.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.307
Wait. Really?

04:26.391 --> 04:28.143
No.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.811
Right, your turn.

04:29.895 --> 04:32.105
Show the world what's inside
that super brain of yours.

04:32.188 --> 04:34.983
Oh, no.
I'm just looking out.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.527
It's for your own good, Kayla.

04:38.486 --> 04:39.486
Kayla.

04:40.572 --> 04:41.948
What the hell?

04:42.032 --> 04:42.908
Maddie!

04:42.991 --> 04:44.701
What are you so scared of?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.286
What are youscared of?

04:46.369 --> 04:48.705
Me? Not a fucking thing.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.115
Then why is it such a big deal

04:51.166 --> 04:54.169
that I splash some paint on a wall?

04:54.252 --> 04:55.420
I just... I...

04:55.504 --> 04:57.213
I want you to have some fun.

04:57.297 --> 05:01.009
You know, the corner of your eye
twitches when you're lying.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.595
Okay.

05:03.679 --> 05:06.056
Maybe I am scared.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.933
For you.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.101
Me? Why?

05:10.185 --> 05:13.396
I've been looking out
for you since, what...

05:13.479 --> 05:14.856
fourth grade?

05:14.940 --> 05:17.358
Yeah. Ben Casey, you beat
the crap out of him.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.610
Right.

05:18.694 --> 05:21.196
But I won't always be there.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.531
Sure, you will.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.490
Oh, get real, Kayla.
You're going to uni.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.785
Yeah. So are you.

05:28.286 --> 05:31.372
- Oh, you lied.
- I want to get out of here.

05:31.456 --> 05:34.459
See the world, experience
something besides this.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.294
- I'll come with you.
- Jesus, Kayla.

05:36.377 --> 05:39.380
I can't babysit you
for the rest of my life.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.174
Oh.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.843
Wow.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.595
I didn't realize that my friendship

05:44.678 --> 05:46.054
was such a burden to you.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.473
It wouldn't be if you
weren't so gutless.

05:48.557 --> 05:49.725
Well, I'd like to see you

05:49.808 --> 05:51.184
living with something like this.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.435
Here we go.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.312
"Boo-hoo,
I have epilepsy."

05:54.395 --> 05:56.272
Poor, fragile Kayla.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.650
The world doesn't care.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.169
Either you start breaking some rules,

06:00.193 --> 06:02.445
or the rules are going to break you.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.615
Really?

06:04.698 --> 06:06.825
Be naughty?
That's your life plan?

06:06.908 --> 06:08.660
No, thanks.

06:11.371 --> 06:15.416
I'd rather be a coward
than a fucking loser.

06:15.501 --> 06:18.461
Fuck you, Kayla.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.174
Hey, Maddie. Wait!

06:23.258 --> 06:26.261
Just go home, Kayla!

06:34.811 --> 06:37.022
Hey, get off me!

06:37.105 --> 06:40.025
Maddie?

06:41.693 --> 06:43.654
Maddie?

06:52.829 --> 06:54.915
Kayla, run!

06:54.998 --> 06:56.750
Oh!

08:02.858 --> 08:04.735
Aah. Aah.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.111
Aah!

08:09.280 --> 08:11.157
Aah!

08:11.241 --> 08:12.241
Help me!

08:13.785 --> 08:14.995
Help me!

08:35.890 --> 08:38.684
Help me!
Let me out!

08:40.520 --> 08:41.605
Help me!

09:40.288 --> 09:42.248
Maddie?!

09:51.925 --> 09:53.468
Maddie?!

09:53.552 --> 09:55.386
Where are you?!

10:08.191 --> 10:09.901
Oh, God.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.697
Somebody!

10:17.033 --> 10:18.409
Maddie?!

10:18.493 --> 10:20.704
Are you here?!

10:27.418 --> 10:28.670
- Aah! Aah!
- Shh! Shh! Shh!

10:28.754 --> 10:30.589
Hey, hey! Hey!

10:30.672 --> 10:32.340
Shh! Shh!

10:32.423 --> 10:33.842
Shh.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.426
Quiet.

10:35.511 --> 10:37.178
Okay?

10:37.262 --> 10:40.015
Let's not announce we're awake
to whoever put us here.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.683
Who are you?

10:41.767 --> 10:43.434
Alice.

10:43.519 --> 10:44.978
This is Sheena.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.980
We just have to get
the hell out of here.

10:48.356 --> 10:49.482
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.527
Do you know?
What's your name? Hey.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.654
Kayla.

10:53.737 --> 10:56.197
Kayla, do you have a phone?

10:56.281 --> 10:58.199
She's got nothing.

11:00.702 --> 11:01.703
Oh!
Mm!

11:20.806 --> 11:22.473
They took everything.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.020
My pills...

11:33.068 --> 11:35.028
Kayla.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.662
Kayla.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.250
How long was I out for?

12:30.333 --> 12:31.877
A few minutes.

12:31.960 --> 12:35.088
What's the deal?

12:35.171 --> 12:38.216
Um, epilepsy.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.926
Well, that's bad.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.386
Well...

12:41.469 --> 12:44.014
it's not too bad, if I have my pills.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.766
Which you don't.

12:45.849 --> 12:46.849
Yeah.

12:46.892 --> 12:48.894
Fine. It's shit.

12:48.977 --> 12:52.230
Um, thanks for staying.

12:55.025 --> 12:59.362
Sometimes I...
black out, hallucinate,

12:59.445 --> 13:00.781
but this was different.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.616
That's fascinating.
Tell your therapist.

13:02.699 --> 13:03.950
Let's go.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.410
Sorry. Where's Sheena?

13:05.493 --> 13:06.804
She left when you did your thing.

13:06.828 --> 13:08.264
She said she was gonna look for help.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.498
So, wait!

13:10.582 --> 13:12.834
How do you know
that that's the right way?

13:12.918 --> 13:14.878
Look, we don't have a map.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.088
We have no idea where we are.

13:17.172 --> 13:19.215
There is no right way.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.539
Well, then why not go that way?

13:20.592 --> 13:22.093
Because Sheena went this way.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.217
We should try and catch up
with her, stick together.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.726
I'm going.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.604
Hey. Wait.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.370
What about you?

13:49.454 --> 13:51.915
Can you remember anything?

13:51.998 --> 13:54.167
Um...

13:54.250 --> 13:56.252
the last thing I remember,
I was in a car park,

13:56.336 --> 13:58.964
about to jack a Commodore.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.549
I got jumped, woke up in a box.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.383
But before the box,
do you remember being

14:02.467 --> 14:07.263
in a kind of operating room,
strapped to a chair?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.558
They did something to my eyes.

14:09.641 --> 14:10.642
Mnh-mnh.

14:10.726 --> 14:11.935
Maddie.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.186
- Who?
- My friend.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.646
She was with me. Maddie!

14:14.730 --> 14:16.481
- What are you doing?!
- My friend.

14:16.565 --> 14:19.025
- Fuck your friend.
- She's probably looking for me.

14:19.109 --> 14:21.486
Listen.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.047
Do your hear anyone yelling your name?

14:23.071 --> 14:24.364
She could be hurt.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.282
Or dead, Kayla.
She could be dead.

14:29.745 --> 14:31.913
Or not even here.
Don't freak out.

14:33.582 --> 14:36.001
If she was your friend, you'd look.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.252
No, I wouldn't.

14:37.335 --> 14:40.130
We need to get out and get help.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.883
So why did you stay with me?

14:46.637 --> 14:48.805
Have you ever been pigging?

14:51.016 --> 14:53.434
Pig shooting.

14:53.519 --> 14:55.562
It's our family time.

14:55.646 --> 14:57.105
Anyway, say there's two pigs.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.440
You set the dogs loose.
Which one do they go for?

14:59.525 --> 15:01.234
I don't know.
The biggest?

15:01.317 --> 15:03.028
The slowest.

15:06.698 --> 15:10.368
I think, in this situation,
we're the pigs.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.704
So I'm the slow pig?

15:12.788 --> 15:15.582
What, you wouldn't outrun me
if you could?

15:19.836 --> 15:22.463
So keep quiet.
We won't have to find out.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.890
Look.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.266
It's another girl.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.726
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.254
Okay, okay.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.352
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

17:31.635 --> 17:32.886
Come on.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.228
Shit.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.366
Shit.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.456
No!

20:25.642 --> 20:26.768
Oh.

22:11.540 --> 22:14.250
Aah! No! No!

23:21.610 --> 23:24.112
Somebody help me!

23:24.821 --> 23:26.322
Oh, shit.

23:26.406 --> 23:27.658
Help me!

23:30.451 --> 23:32.037
Help me, please!

23:32.120 --> 23:35.874
Help me!
Coward.

23:35.957 --> 23:37.458
Get up.

23:37.543 --> 23:40.211
Help me, please!

23:40.295 --> 23:42.506
Get up.

23:42.589 --> 23:43.632
Run!

23:43.715 --> 23:46.259
Run! He's coming!

24:26.717 --> 24:27.717
Please.

24:29.302 --> 24:30.512
Please don't!

24:49.615 --> 24:51.366
Shit.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.695
What's your name?

25:28.779 --> 25:30.238
Sally.

25:33.784 --> 25:36.202
Sally, it's not far now.

25:36.286 --> 25:37.704
Okay?

26:24.626 --> 26:25.711
No.

26:25.794 --> 26:27.838
Come on.

26:27.921 --> 26:29.089
Come on, Sally.

26:29.172 --> 26:30.716
Sally, get up.

26:30.799 --> 26:32.509
It's cold.

26:32.593 --> 26:34.845
Is it winter already?

26:34.928 --> 26:37.598
I don't want to die.

26:37.681 --> 26:38.974
That's okay.

26:39.057 --> 26:41.560
You're not going to.

26:41.643 --> 26:44.688
I'm a good person, you know?

26:44.771 --> 26:46.397
Why are they doing this?

26:46.481 --> 26:49.025
I don't know.

26:49.109 --> 26:51.361
Maybe we're being punished.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.532
You'll be safe in here.

26:55.616 --> 26:57.408
Okay?

27:06.627 --> 27:08.754
Do you believe in magic?

27:08.837 --> 27:11.381
In the Furies?

27:11.464 --> 27:12.799
Yep.

27:12.883 --> 27:14.092
Yep. Sure.

27:20.766 --> 27:23.393
The Goddess protect you.

27:28.815 --> 27:31.652
You stay hidden, okay?

27:31.735 --> 27:34.112
Just keep quiet.

27:34.195 --> 27:35.363
I'll find help.
I will.

27:35.446 --> 27:37.908
I'll come back for you, okay?

30:55.313 --> 30:56.982
Please!

31:30.098 --> 31:31.725
No!

32:12.891 --> 32:13.892
What the fuck?

32:27.197 --> 32:28.364
Sally.

32:42.170 --> 32:43.964
Sally.

33:02.023 --> 33:04.442
Sally.

33:04.526 --> 33:06.528
Oh, God.

33:13.409 --> 33:15.495
Why?

35:28.545 --> 35:30.421
Shit.

35:30.506 --> 35:32.257
Shit.

36:50.335 --> 36:51.419
Aah!

36:54.339 --> 36:56.007
Oh, no.

36:59.886 --> 37:01.722
No! No, no, no.
Don't!

37:08.269 --> 37:09.479
No, no. No.

37:09.563 --> 37:10.772
No, no, no, no.
Please listen.

37:10.856 --> 37:12.357
No, no.
You're gonna be all right.

37:13.483 --> 37:14.735
Please. Please.

37:14.818 --> 37:16.987
It... It was an accident!

37:17.070 --> 37:18.070
And...

37:20.073 --> 37:21.324
Help me!

37:25.787 --> 37:28.164
Sheena, help!

37:30.375 --> 37:32.753
She's dead.

37:42.888 --> 37:44.222
Please.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.307
Stay with me.

39:17.440 --> 39:19.359
Maddie.

39:19.442 --> 39:21.612
You had a fit.

39:21.695 --> 39:24.656
My cousin is epileptic.

39:28.660 --> 39:30.245
Who's Maddie?

39:33.707 --> 39:35.458
My friend.

39:35.542 --> 39:39.880
Sheena left.

39:41.214 --> 39:43.133
Do you know where she went?

39:44.885 --> 39:46.928
She was here.

39:47.012 --> 39:49.097
You killed Jackie.

39:49.180 --> 39:51.725
And then she was gone!

39:51.808 --> 39:54.310
Are you gonna kill me?

39:54.394 --> 39:56.813
No, no, no.
Look, what... what hap...

39:56.897 --> 39:58.774
What happened, um...

39:58.857 --> 39:59.983
it... it was an accident.

40:00.066 --> 40:01.652
Uh...

40:01.735 --> 40:04.362
Please don't be scared.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

40:07.157 --> 40:09.576
I'm not scared.

40:09.660 --> 40:11.036
Okay.

40:11.119 --> 40:13.454
I'm Rose.

40:13.539 --> 40:14.998
Kayla.

40:25.634 --> 40:29.387
I stayed.

40:29.470 --> 40:30.764
We're friends now.

40:30.847 --> 40:33.892
Yeah, of course we are.

40:37.145 --> 40:39.523
Is Maddie here?

40:39.606 --> 40:41.066
I don't know.

40:41.149 --> 40:44.277
I've been, um...

40:44.360 --> 40:47.322
seeing things when I'm, um...

40:47.405 --> 40:48.615
you know...

40:48.699 --> 40:50.742
having my seizures.

40:50.826 --> 40:52.578
They're...
called hallucinations.

40:52.661 --> 40:53.745
No, no.

40:53.829 --> 40:55.371
This was different.
I...

40:55.455 --> 40:57.666
I-I saw her.

40:57.749 --> 41:01.044
She was being hidden.

41:01.127 --> 41:02.588
Ha... Have you seen them?

41:02.671 --> 41:03.671
Them?

41:03.714 --> 41:05.423
The men, with the masks.

41:05.507 --> 41:08.009
Y-Yes.
Yes, he had a bird face.

41:08.093 --> 41:10.470
Uh, let me think.

41:10.554 --> 41:12.681
Mm...

41:12.764 --> 41:14.140
An... An owl?

41:14.224 --> 41:16.226
I'm not sure.
A barn owl?

41:16.309 --> 41:17.519
And then what happened?

41:17.603 --> 41:19.229
I ran.

41:19.312 --> 41:20.564
You should never trust someone

41:20.647 --> 41:22.440
if you can't see their real face.

41:22.524 --> 41:24.586
- Just because they post nice things and tell you...
- Sorry.

41:24.610 --> 41:26.695
Rose, after you ran?

41:26.778 --> 41:29.280
Sheena found me.

41:31.116 --> 41:33.451
And we've been hiding.

41:35.621 --> 41:38.749
I thought we were friends.

41:38.832 --> 41:41.877
But friends don't leave.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.879
Rose.

41:43.962 --> 41:45.797
I won't leave you,
but... but I have

41:45.881 --> 41:47.549
to find my other friend, Maddie.

41:47.633 --> 41:48.717
She's probably dead.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.636
No, she's not dead!

41:55.724 --> 41:57.934
We're going to die.

42:09.530 --> 42:11.782
No, there has to be a way out.

42:15.451 --> 42:17.538
Do you remember the operating room?

42:17.621 --> 42:19.873
I...

42:19.956 --> 42:21.750
I thought it was a dream.

42:21.833 --> 42:23.001
Did you have the same dream?

42:29.215 --> 42:31.968
You should look away.

42:32.052 --> 42:35.722
Why?

42:35.806 --> 42:37.473
Kayla?

42:41.562 --> 42:43.479
Kayla?

42:53.615 --> 42:54.866
What are you doing?!

43:22.686 --> 43:25.772
It's some sort of implant.

44:03.018 --> 44:05.020
They're in our eyes,

44:05.103 --> 44:07.606
our heads.

44:09.274 --> 44:11.693
I know you're watching us.

44:13.153 --> 44:15.071
Who are you talking to?

44:15.155 --> 44:17.783
The fuckers who put us here.

45:35.193 --> 45:38.279
No, please.

45:39.656 --> 45:41.282
Get down!

45:42.158 --> 45:43.702
You came back.

45:46.412 --> 45:48.206
What the hell?

45:48.289 --> 45:50.208
Is that her eye?

45:50.291 --> 45:51.793
It was her.

45:53.920 --> 45:56.757
Oh, my God.

45:56.840 --> 45:58.509
There's two more of them.

46:03.263 --> 46:04.931
They're hunting us.

46:05.015 --> 46:06.099
Yeah, no shit.

46:06.182 --> 46:08.268
Guys, we can't stay here.

46:08.351 --> 46:09.686
Well, do you have another plan?

46:09.770 --> 46:12.606
Besides whatever the hell that is?

46:14.399 --> 46:16.067
Maybe.

46:30.456 --> 46:32.208
What is that?

46:32.292 --> 46:34.294
The people that put us here,

46:34.377 --> 46:36.171
t-they've put these
in our heads.

46:36.254 --> 46:38.298
I-I think that they're watching,

46:38.381 --> 46:40.717
- listening to us.
- Because of that?

46:40.801 --> 46:43.845
And... And we... we can't
get out of the forest.

46:43.929 --> 46:45.096
There's some kind of barrier.

46:45.180 --> 46:46.723
The siren.

46:46.807 --> 46:49.475
Rose and I remember
a kind of operating room.

46:49.560 --> 46:51.562
Do you?
Uh, sort of.

46:51.645 --> 46:56.024
I remember walking home
from a friend's party,

46:56.107 --> 46:58.318
and some creeps...

47:00.654 --> 47:03.907
I was at home, by myself.

47:03.990 --> 47:05.784
Mother won't let me go to school.

47:05.867 --> 47:07.911
She thinks she's the best teacher.

47:07.994 --> 47:09.495
But why us?

47:09.580 --> 47:11.957
Because it's a fucked-up world
full of fucked-up men.

47:13.542 --> 47:15.586
We're trapped.

47:17.504 --> 47:20.591
We'll hole up here until dark.
Okay?

47:20.674 --> 47:24.052
There's no point
running around in daylight.

47:24.135 --> 47:26.972
Oh, shit.

47:27.055 --> 47:28.223
Hide.

47:28.306 --> 47:29.725
Hide.

49:27.092 --> 49:28.510
Sheena!

50:00.375 --> 50:01.502
He's gone.

50:01.585 --> 50:02.961
Okay. Okay.

50:03.044 --> 50:05.631
He's gone, Rose.

50:13.138 --> 50:14.640
You okay?

50:17.518 --> 50:19.185
Okay?

50:23.690 --> 50:25.150
Why didn't he just kill her?

50:25.233 --> 50:28.194
It was like he was trying
to see her face.

50:28.278 --> 50:31.322
What's so special about me?

50:31.406 --> 50:32.533
The coffins.

50:32.616 --> 50:34.117
The boxes that we were in.

50:34.200 --> 50:35.577
"Beauty 6" was on mine.

50:35.661 --> 50:37.871
And I saw some with "Beast" on them.

50:37.954 --> 50:40.165
Beauty and the Beast.

50:40.248 --> 50:44.377
Maybe they have to save one of us.

50:44.460 --> 50:45.504
That's crazy.

50:45.587 --> 50:46.838
No, look.
I saw a...

50:46.922 --> 50:49.049
I don't know how to explain it.

50:49.132 --> 50:51.134
My... My seizures keep
messing with these implants.

50:51.217 --> 50:52.636
Hallucinations.

50:52.719 --> 50:54.846
No. It's like I'm seeing
through their eyes.

50:54.930 --> 50:57.473
And I saw one of them
hiding my friend Maddie.

50:58.600 --> 51:03.689
And when Sally died, this
pig-face guy's head exploded.

51:03.772 --> 51:06.399
A lot of women seem to die
in front of you, Kayla.

51:06.482 --> 51:09.152
And one of them saved me in the field.

51:10.654 --> 51:12.405
They pair us up.

51:12.488 --> 51:13.740
And they cage us in.

51:13.824 --> 51:15.701
We die, they die.

51:15.784 --> 51:19.204
You killed Jackie,
and then a Beast died?

51:19.287 --> 51:20.413
I think so.

51:20.496 --> 51:22.498
You didn't.

51:22.583 --> 51:24.710
Your head didn't explode.

51:24.793 --> 51:26.712
No. Why?

51:30.173 --> 51:34.010
There's nothing stopping you
or Rose from killing me.

51:35.929 --> 51:39.349
Sheena, we just have to wait,
like you said.

51:39.432 --> 51:40.642
Someone will come for us.

51:40.726 --> 51:42.769
There's no one coming for us.

51:42.853 --> 51:44.646
We're on our own.
Look, look.

51:44.730 --> 51:46.565
I-I think
that there's a way out.

51:46.648 --> 51:48.585
- Oh, yeah? Another one of your little visions?
- No, okay?

51:48.609 --> 51:49.651
On the visitor board.
What?

51:49.735 --> 51:51.111
On the other side of town.

51:51.194 --> 51:53.279
- It says that there's a gold mine.
- Yeah?

51:53.363 --> 51:54.615
So I think that... that...

51:54.698 --> 51:56.324
that that's where Maddie is, okay?

51:56.407 --> 51:57.701
So?
Come on.

51:57.784 --> 52:00.245
- You have to help me find her.
- Yeah, right.

52:00.328 --> 52:03.248
Run around with you
and end up like her.

52:03.331 --> 52:04.958
That was as accident.

52:05.041 --> 52:07.161
But we're easier to kill them
than one of them? Right?

52:09.630 --> 52:11.464
Put it down.

52:11.548 --> 52:13.174
Now!

52:13.258 --> 52:18.054
It's a game.
There's only one way out.

52:18.138 --> 52:20.098
Win.

52:27.689 --> 52:29.525
Run!

52:42.453 --> 52:44.455
Come on.

52:55.050 --> 52:56.760
I can't see him.

52:56.843 --> 52:58.679
Can you see Sheena?

52:58.762 --> 53:01.181
We need to stay away
from Sheena. Okay?

53:01.264 --> 53:04.142
She's not on our side anymore.

53:07.312 --> 53:10.065
But why would she want to hurt us?

53:10.148 --> 53:13.902
Because it's easier
to kill us than them.

53:13.985 --> 53:15.821
That's cheating.

53:17.823 --> 53:19.407
Look...

53:19.490 --> 53:21.827
I'm not like Sheena, okay?

53:24.955 --> 53:26.998
I won't kill you.

53:27.082 --> 53:30.794
And you won't kill me?

53:30.877 --> 53:33.547
Will you?

53:33.630 --> 53:36.174
No, I would never.

53:36.257 --> 53:39.845
We're friends.

53:39.928 --> 53:41.722
That's right.

53:41.805 --> 53:45.100
Okay. Come here.

53:45.183 --> 53:49.312
This... is us

53:49.395 --> 53:50.856
And there's a visitor board here,

53:50.939 --> 53:53.399
which should show us
where the gold mine is.

53:53.483 --> 53:55.652
Oh... no.

53:55.736 --> 53:58.446
W-We should stay here.

53:58.530 --> 54:01.992
Hey, friends stick together, right?

54:02.075 --> 54:02.993
Yes.

54:03.076 --> 54:06.079
Well, Maddie's my friend.

54:06.162 --> 54:08.874
Don't you want to help me find her?

54:12.335 --> 54:14.254
Okay.

54:14.337 --> 54:17.090
We just have to keep out of sight.

54:55.879 --> 54:57.005
Okay.

54:57.088 --> 54:59.841
Did you see anyone?

54:59.925 --> 55:02.218
Let's go.

55:15.481 --> 55:18.234
Okay.
Come on, Rose.

55:35.335 --> 55:36.920
Hurry up.
Come on, Rose.

55:40.549 --> 55:42.718
I'm stuck.

55:44.678 --> 55:46.722
Just go back.

56:14.916 --> 56:16.835
Go back.
Go on.

56:19.420 --> 56:20.672
St... Stop.

56:20.756 --> 56:22.173
What?

56:22.257 --> 56:23.424
Okay.

56:23.509 --> 56:25.426
If you scream...
we're dead.

56:34.060 --> 56:36.479
No! No!

57:05.008 --> 57:07.093
Don't leave me!
Okay.

57:07.177 --> 57:08.845
Remember, hide your face.

57:08.929 --> 57:09.929
Okay?

58:06.486 --> 58:08.113
Kayla!

58:08.196 --> 58:10.991
Come on then!!

58:51.865 --> 58:53.992
What's she doing?

59:12.427 --> 59:15.556
She's going for Maddie.

59:15.639 --> 59:16.890
No!

59:24.815 --> 59:26.942
You're not getting to Maddie.

59:30.654 --> 59:32.739
Aren't you about due
for one of your little...

59:32.823 --> 59:35.408
episodes.

59:35.491 --> 59:38.620
Look... you can't make it
on your own, okay?

59:38.704 --> 59:40.997
There are at least four of them
still hunting us.

59:41.081 --> 59:43.792
One of them is my protector...

59:43.875 --> 59:45.752
My beast, right?

59:45.836 --> 59:48.630
Takes it to three.

59:48.714 --> 59:50.215
I do you...

59:50.298 --> 59:52.217
that's two.

59:53.885 --> 59:55.303
Rose...

59:55.386 --> 59:56.597
one.

59:56.680 --> 59:58.557
Sheena...

59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.100
please.

01:00:00.183 --> 01:00:02.102
Then your little friend in the mine.

01:00:05.063 --> 01:00:07.608
I should have... Should've what?

01:00:14.573 --> 01:00:16.050
You'd do anything
to save your little friend,

01:00:16.074 --> 01:00:19.285
wouldn't you?

01:00:19.369 --> 01:00:21.913
You'd kill me.

01:00:21.997 --> 01:00:23.957
You'd kill Rose.

01:00:26.292 --> 01:00:29.630
Say it!

01:00:54.154 --> 01:00:56.197
Aren't you gonna save her?

01:01:00.076 --> 01:01:03.413
Yes.

01:01:04.873 --> 01:01:07.208
It's her!

01:01:44.245 --> 01:01:48.166
You are my Beast, aren't you?

01:02:49.978 --> 01:02:52.188
Where were you?!

01:02:52.272 --> 01:02:53.481
I called.

01:02:53.565 --> 01:02:55.191
You didn't help me!

01:02:55.275 --> 01:02:56.275
No, I did.

01:02:56.317 --> 01:02:57.778
Liar!

01:02:57.861 --> 01:03:01.197
Liar! Liar! Liar!
Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar!

01:03:01.281 --> 01:03:02.281
You're safe.

01:03:02.323 --> 01:03:03.324
You're safe with me.

01:03:05.201 --> 01:03:08.664
I promise.

01:03:08.747 --> 01:03:11.249
What happened?

01:03:14.294 --> 01:03:16.046
There was a beast.

01:03:18.924 --> 01:03:20.801
So, he was Sheena's.

01:03:39.695 --> 01:03:42.823
That has to be it.

01:03:42.906 --> 01:03:45.241
That's where she is.

01:03:45.325 --> 01:03:48.036
Please be alive, Maddie.

01:03:52.457 --> 01:03:54.167
Close your eyes.

01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:56.169
Why?

01:03:56.252 --> 01:03:58.463
You know that
they're watching and listening.

01:04:00.423 --> 01:04:01.758
Since we were kids,

01:04:01.842 --> 01:04:05.095
this is how Maddie and I
shared secrets.

01:04:13.436 --> 01:04:15.105
Do you understand?

01:04:15.188 --> 01:04:16.857
You and me?

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:18.191
And Maddie.

01:04:18.274 --> 01:04:20.276
Okay?

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.863
Let's go.

01:04:30.411 --> 01:04:32.205
Come on!

01:04:49.681 --> 01:04:51.517
Come on, Maddie.
Where are you?

01:04:53.476 --> 01:04:55.311
Maddie?

01:04:55.395 --> 01:04:57.105
Where are you?!

01:05:13.454 --> 01:05:14.790
Maddie!

01:05:14.873 --> 01:05:19.628
Maddie!

01:05:19.711 --> 01:05:21.547
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:23.089
It's me.
It's Kayla.

01:05:23.173 --> 01:05:25.509
What's happening, Kayla?

01:05:25.592 --> 01:05:27.719
Hey, it's okay, Maddie.
It's all right.

01:05:27.803 --> 01:05:29.345
Come on.
You're safe.

01:05:29.429 --> 01:05:31.431
- We're not safe! We're not...
- Maddie, don't.

01:05:31.515 --> 01:05:34.560
Please, just...
calm down, okay?

01:05:34.643 --> 01:05:37.145
I thought you must have been dead.

01:05:37.228 --> 01:05:39.123
I should have looked for you.
Why didn't I look for you?

01:05:39.147 --> 01:05:42.317
Because you're not a real friend.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.652
You're a coward.

01:05:43.735 --> 01:05:46.321
Shut up, Rose!

01:05:46.404 --> 01:05:48.615
Maybe I am...

01:05:48.699 --> 01:05:50.241
a coward and a loser.

01:05:50.325 --> 01:05:53.161
Who cares, all right?

01:05:53.244 --> 01:05:56.039
What does that have to do
with being friends?

01:06:02.128 --> 01:06:05.340
Tell her about the girls you killed.

01:06:05.423 --> 01:06:08.343
What?

01:06:08.426 --> 01:06:09.553
For her.

01:06:12.848 --> 01:06:15.934
Break the rules or be broken, right?

01:06:18.103 --> 01:06:20.271
Oh, Kayla.

01:06:26.361 --> 01:06:27.779
Where's this escape?

01:06:27.863 --> 01:06:29.322
Through the mine.

01:06:29.405 --> 01:06:31.449
What are you talking about?
This is the mine.

01:06:33.326 --> 01:06:36.788
No. No!
No, no, no.

01:06:36.872 --> 01:06:40.250
This is it.
This is the only way.

01:06:40.333 --> 01:06:43.754
Th... There's another entrance.
We can get past the barrier.

01:06:43.837 --> 01:06:47.048
- I-I'm sure that we can...
- There's nothing there.

01:06:47.132 --> 01:06:49.467
This is it.

01:06:49.551 --> 01:06:52.513
What do we do, Maddie?
What do we do?

01:06:52.596 --> 01:06:54.681
I-I don't know.

01:06:54.765 --> 01:06:57.684
No, no, no, Maddie.
You have to help me!

01:06:57.768 --> 01:06:59.352
Maddie, you have to help me.

01:06:59.435 --> 01:07:02.397
- No! I-I-I don't know!
- Kayla!

01:07:04.983 --> 01:07:06.652
Oh, God.

01:07:09.404 --> 01:07:12.240
No, there's three of us.

01:07:12.323 --> 01:07:14.409
We can...

01:08:17.598 --> 01:08:21.017
You had another fit.

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:26.022
The Owl, the last one...
He was Maddie's protector.

01:08:34.573 --> 01:08:36.448
I saved you.

01:08:36.533 --> 01:08:39.368
N...

01:08:39.452 --> 01:08:42.247
Maddie...

01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:46.585
No, Maddie, please.
Don't leave me.

01:08:46.667 --> 01:08:48.504
What do we do now?

01:08:52.883 --> 01:08:55.385
"Now"?!

01:08:57.554 --> 01:08:58.555
Yeah.

01:08:58.639 --> 01:09:01.390
Is... Is the game over?

01:09:04.144 --> 01:09:06.604
Kayla?

01:09:06.688 --> 01:09:08.982
How are we gonna escape?

01:09:09.064 --> 01:09:11.151
There's no escape!

01:09:11.234 --> 01:09:12.611
Okay?

01:09:12.694 --> 01:09:14.154
They'll come for us,

01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:16.573
and they'll kill us...
or worse.

01:09:18.366 --> 01:09:19.660
K-Kayla...

01:09:19.743 --> 01:09:22.412
Just leave us alone!

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:27.417
But...

01:09:27.501 --> 01:09:31.046
But I saved you.

01:09:31.129 --> 01:09:34.340
And you promised to save me.

01:09:34.424 --> 01:09:38.303
I wanted to save her.

01:09:41.598 --> 01:09:44.725
I should've let you die!

01:10:12.003 --> 01:10:14.506
You said friends...

01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:16.592
stick together.

01:14:14.746 --> 01:14:17.040
Prepare winner for the next match.

01:14:59.499 --> 01:15:02.836
God damn it!

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:06.507
Line secure. Proceed.

01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:08.466
Yeah. Well,
these replays are bullshit.

01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:13.013
Recruiting for the new match
is in progress.

01:15:15.181 --> 01:15:17.183
As a founding member,
you are invited to...

01:15:17.267 --> 01:15:20.812
Who's there? ...the bonus program.

01:15:22.814 --> 01:15:24.733
Response required.

01:15:30.321 --> 01:15:33.033
I'm calling the cops right now.

01:15:33.116 --> 01:15:34.868
Really?

01:15:34.951 --> 01:15:38.830
Uh, no. I wasn't talking to you.
There's someone in my house.

01:15:38.914 --> 01:15:43.168
Member TCM, you are
in breach of protocol.

01:15:43.251 --> 01:15:45.128
Any subsequent breach

01:15:45.211 --> 01:15:49.090
will require compulsory participation.

01:16:00.686 --> 01:16:03.146
Who gave you this?

01:16:06.858 --> 01:16:08.819
What?

01:16:11.279 --> 01:16:13.073
Who gave you this?

01:16:20.831 --> 01:16:22.666
Derek...

01:16:22.749 --> 01:16:24.543
this club that you're a member of...

01:16:24.626 --> 01:16:27.045
I got no idea what the hell
you're talking about.

01:16:27.128 --> 01:16:28.296
I want names.

01:16:28.379 --> 01:16:30.256
Fucking let me go!
or I'll...

01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:32.050
Or you'll what?

01:16:32.133 --> 01:16:34.469
You'll kill us?

01:16:34.553 --> 01:16:37.222
No, that's impossible.

01:16:37.305 --> 01:16:39.099
No, only Rose survived that game.

01:16:39.182 --> 01:16:42.894
And yet, here I am.

01:16:42.978 --> 01:16:45.772
Wait, wait. This...
This is mistake.

01:16:45.856 --> 01:16:48.149
Listen, I had nothing to do
with what happened to you.

01:16:48.233 --> 01:16:50.527
You own this company.

01:16:50.611 --> 01:16:52.278
Yeah, I own a lot of companies.

01:16:52.362 --> 01:16:55.406
Then you should be careful
who you do business with.

01:16:57.909 --> 01:17:00.411
I-I tried to cancel
my membership.

01:17:00.495 --> 01:17:02.413
But you can't.
Once you're in...

01:17:02.497 --> 01:17:03.683
You really should have tried harder.

01:17:03.707 --> 01:17:06.585
I want names!

01:17:06.668 --> 01:17:08.712
Mike, okay.
It's just Mike.

01:17:15.301 --> 01:17:18.388
Mike!
M-Mike Fallon.

01:17:18.471 --> 01:17:19.765
He's in my phone.

01:17:19.848 --> 01:17:21.307
He's the only other member I know,

01:17:21.391 --> 01:17:22.643
but he knows everyone...

01:17:22.726 --> 01:17:24.978
All the other founding members.

01:17:27.606 --> 01:17:28.940
Do I believe him?

01:17:39.492 --> 01:17:41.161
Who the hell are you talking to?

01:17:59.763 --> 01:18:03.058
Listen to me, all right?

01:18:03.141 --> 01:18:04.309
I have money.

01:18:04.392 --> 01:18:05.936
It's in my safe.

01:18:06.019 --> 01:18:07.688
You can get away.

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:12.483
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:18:12.568 --> 01:18:14.528
No, no, you don't have to this.

01:18:14.611 --> 01:18:17.614
Okay, you don't have to this.
You don't have to kill me.

01:18:17.698 --> 01:18:20.158
All right? I won't tell them
you're still alive.

01:18:22.536 --> 01:18:24.830
Oh, they'll find out soon enough.

01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:28.584
No! No! No!
