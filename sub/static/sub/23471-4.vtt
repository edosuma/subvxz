WEBVTT

00:05.547 --> 00:08.299
Oh, man, I really wanted
to see you tonight, Max.

00:08.383 --> 00:10.677
My clinical hours got rescheduled,
and I'm free.

00:11.928 --> 00:13.221
Squirrel attack?

00:15.223 --> 00:16.850
How many people could it have bitten?

00:19.477 --> 00:20.478
That many?

00:23.023 --> 00:27.736
Mmm. Oh, no. No, I just have classes
and kid stuff for the rest of the week,

00:27.819 --> 00:31.364
but I really wanted to see you
because I have an emergency in my--

00:31.448 --> 00:33.867
-Hey, Mom.
-[stammers] Thank you, Dr. Berkowitz.

00:33.950 --> 00:35.452
Good work phone call. Thanks. Bye.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.039
What's up?

00:39.622 --> 00:40.582
I need money.

00:40.665 --> 00:43.042
And I need a margarita,
but it's 7:00 in the morning.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.255
Mom, please. I'm going to a movie.

00:47.338 --> 00:49.841
Okay,  papito.  Here.

00:50.925 --> 00:52.260
Ten dollars.

00:52.635 --> 00:54.095
Oh, maybe I wasn't clear.

00:54.512 --> 00:56.306
I'm actually going to a movie
in this century.

00:57.432 --> 01:01.603
It's in color and everything.
A ticket costs $9.50.

01:01.686 --> 01:03.063
And I expect change.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.106
No, I feel your pain.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.650
I never had enough money
to go to the movies with friends.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.487
Or enough friends to go to the movies
with friends.

01:11.237 --> 01:14.032
Oh, I know, why don't you pluck
your one mustache hair,

01:14.115 --> 01:15.950
and you can get the kid price?

01:16.034 --> 01:18.703
Why don't you pluck
your 20 mustache hairs?

01:19.704 --> 01:20.538
Joke's on you,

01:20.622 --> 01:23.208
because each one of these hairs
is a blow to the patriarchy.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.127
Oh, you win.

01:27.670 --> 01:30.632
Come on, Mom. All my friends get
way more cash from their parents.

01:30.715 --> 01:33.092
What have I told you about
comparing yourself to other people?

01:33.176 --> 01:35.011
To always do it and make sure I'm better.

01:36.387 --> 01:37.931
No, that's your  abuelita.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.935
Look, my, uh, clinical hours
got all squirrelly.

01:44.020 --> 01:47.941
So I'm gonna take you to the movies
and show you how to have fun on a budget.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.400
What? No.

01:50.443 --> 01:51.611
It'll be great.

01:52.153 --> 01:55.281
-It'll be like a date with your mom.
-No! No, no, no.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.783
-Stop. Oh, my God.
-[kissing]

01:56.866 --> 01:58.785
Come on. Mama. Mama. Mama.

01:58.868 --> 01:59.869
[chuckles]

01:59.953 --> 02:03.581
Ay. ¡Ay, ay, ay, ay! ¡Ay!  Oh... [groaning]

02:06.376 --> 02:09.504
Well, don't make such a big deal of it.
I'm fine.

02:09.587 --> 02:10.630
What happened?

02:10.713 --> 02:13.842
She tripped on the sidewalk
in front of the building and hurt her arm.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.594
[grunts] I had to break my fall.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.764
Some people's faces are worth protecting.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.558
Papito  knows what I'm talking about.

02:25.854 --> 02:29.858
-Abuelita,  how did you trip?
-That stupid sidewalk was broken.

02:30.441 --> 02:32.986
The roots of the tree pushed it up.
[groans]

02:33.069 --> 02:36.156
Man, Mother Nature is turning on us.

02:37.365 --> 02:39.492
And after we've treated her so well.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.663
[theme song playing]

03:30.793 --> 03:33.963
Okay, I have figured out
what to do about that tree.

03:34.505 --> 03:36.549
Form a Million  Abuelita  March.

03:37.425 --> 03:40.720
That adds up to, like,
seven million hard candies.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.225
No, no, no.

03:45.308 --> 03:49.604
I have something better than all that,
that will cut through the red tape.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.523
Ha! Ha!

03:52.607 --> 03:54.192
-Ha!
-Abuelita,  be careful!

03:54.275 --> 03:55.443
Oh, I know. I'm sorry.

03:55.526 --> 03:58.613
This is not my usual machete arm. [laughs]

03:58.696 --> 04:01.950
-Ah... [exclaims]
-Okay. Let's just put this back in the...

04:02.450 --> 04:04.244
machete cozy?

04:05.286 --> 04:08.915
Hey, come on. I just want to chop off
the roots of the tree.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.626
There's something less murder-y
that might help.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.378
Uh, Proposition U.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.046
You want to proposition me?

04:16.714 --> 04:19.968
No. Proposition, the letter "U."

04:20.051 --> 04:22.303
It's a ballot measure
in next week's local election.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.765
It would pay for infrastructure repairs,
including sidewalks.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.517
And there may even be enough money

04:27.600 --> 04:29.602
to replace the plastic recycling bins
in Echo Park

04:29.686 --> 04:32.939
with new recycling bins
made out of recycled recycling bins.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.693
That is great.
About the sidewalks getting fixed,

04:36.776 --> 04:38.278
not your trash talk.

04:39.153 --> 04:43.157
Okay. The election is this Tuesday,
so make sure you vote "yes" on Prop U.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.827
I would love to, but I don't vote.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.580
[chuckles] What do you mean
you don't vote?

04:49.664 --> 04:52.792
I mean that on the election day,
instead of voting,

04:53.251 --> 04:54.627
I don't vote.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.881
[chuckles] But you don't mean
you never vote?

04:58.965 --> 05:00.717
Like, you voted in the last election?

05:01.509 --> 05:03.845
Oh, the last one? No.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.098
And now we have that monster
in the White House!

05:07.181 --> 05:08.349
Well, don't blame me.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.435
I didn't vote for him!

05:11.728 --> 05:13.187
Good for you.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.400
Oh, you will never believe
what we just discovered.

05:17.483 --> 05:21.571
Mami,  how many times have I told you
to give that machete to the Goodwill?

05:22.739 --> 05:26.909
Yeah, I don't think a machete
is really on brand for them.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.165
No. We found out  Abuelita  doesn't vote.

05:32.248 --> 05:33.291
Oh, that? Yeah, I know.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.878
What? How could you let this happen?

05:36.961 --> 05:40.256
Voting is the single most important thing
we can do as Americans.

05:40.339 --> 05:41.883
Don't yell at me, I know.

05:41.966 --> 05:43.760
I vote every four years
like I'm supposed to.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.848
What about primaries, midterm elections,
local elections?

05:48.931 --> 05:50.391
Yeah, I don't care about that stuff.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.811
I vote in other ways!

05:53.895 --> 05:55.772
I take a lot of online quizzes.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.025
Turns out I'm a Hufflepuff.

06:02.236 --> 06:04.489
See, the great thing
about having a green card is

06:04.572 --> 06:07.533
you get to live here without having to do
all the stuff Americans have to,

06:07.617 --> 06:11.454
like vote or serve jury duty
or become obese.

06:13.539 --> 06:16.084
Okay, but at least you vote
in Canadian elections.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.002
Mmm... No.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.088
Even in Canada, nothing ever changes.

06:20.630 --> 06:23.424
Clean air, sensible gun control,
free health care.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.592
The system's rigged.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.930
Vote, don't vote, it doesn't matter.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.224
We always end up with the same  comebolas.

06:32.308 --> 06:33.643
But you're always talking about

06:33.726 --> 06:36.312
how this country saved you
from a communist dictatorship

06:36.395 --> 06:38.189
and how democracy is a gift.

06:38.731 --> 06:39.732
That's true.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.361
God bless the USA.

06:44.445 --> 06:47.031
These  colores  don't run.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.034
So why don't you vote?

06:50.118 --> 06:52.286
It doesn't do anything.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.579
[grunts]  ¡Ay!

06:54.247 --> 06:56.958
I mean, I can't wait to turn 18
so that I can vote,

06:57.041 --> 06:58.167
and you're wasting yours?

06:58.793 --> 06:59.794
She's right,  Mami.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.587
This isn't one of those big elections?

07:01.671 --> 07:02.839
They're all big elections!

07:02.922 --> 07:04.465
They're all big elections,  Mami!

07:07.677 --> 07:10.638
I mean, sure, some issues
are more important than others,

07:10.721 --> 07:14.475
-but I can think of a thousand reasons--
-¡Ay, ay, ay!  Okay! You win.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.687
And if you stop talking, I win.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.399
-So you'll do it?
-Yes. Yes. Yes.

07:22.066 --> 07:23.693
I thought this was a democracy.

07:24.235 --> 07:27.989
But this is some kind of dictatorship
where people are forced to vote!

07:32.034 --> 07:35.455
Ooh, okay. Let's find three seats.
One for me, one for you,

07:35.538 --> 07:37.373
one for the bag of money we're gonna save.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.085
Oh, God. Those kids are from school.

07:41.836 --> 07:44.213
-You wanna sit with them?
-No, no, no, let's stay here.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.633
Hey, guys.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.051
[laughing]

07:50.470 --> 07:51.637
Great.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.098
First I have no money,
now I have no dignity.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.103
Maybe, but what you do have is...

08:00.146 --> 08:01.147
What?

08:02.982 --> 08:05.693
Where'd these come from? My pockets.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.279
Is that why you're wearing cargo pants?

08:08.696 --> 08:10.990
First of all, they were very stylish
in the '90s.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.035
Second, it is the key to sneaking food

08:14.118 --> 08:16.537
past any by-the-book ushers
who might narc on you.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.372
Ba-blam! Licorice.

08:20.458 --> 08:23.127
-Where'd you get these? The 99-Cent Store?
-[scoffs]

08:23.211 --> 08:24.962
The 98-Cent Store.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.090
Yeah, your  mami  ain't no chump.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.471
See, we may not be spending
a lot of money, but it's lit, right?

08:35.848 --> 08:37.099
5-0!

08:46.943 --> 08:48.069
Dust it off. Five-second rule.

08:58.454 --> 09:01.207
Abuelita,  I want to study
the election issues with you.

09:05.670 --> 09:06.587
Ugh.

09:08.005 --> 09:12.426
Come on. I mean, otherwise you'll just be
another uninformed voter.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.262
Yeah. They look so happy.

09:16.764 --> 09:21.519
Yeah. And who wants to live like that?
[chuckles]

09:21.602 --> 09:24.647
Anyway, there's a lot of
really serious stuff on this ballot.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.567
Um, let's start with Prop T,
"Stand Behind Teachers."

09:27.650 --> 09:31.445
Oh, that's easy, 'cause I love teachers.
I am a teacher.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.656
I will vote "yes" on T.

09:34.031 --> 09:35.116
Oh, good job,  Abuelita.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.785
-You just got them all fired.
-[gasps]

09:38.619 --> 09:40.121
[speaking Spanish]

09:40.871 --> 09:44.625
[sighs] A lot of these ballot measures
are intentionally misleading.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.502
So, Prop T would replace union teachers

09:46.586 --> 09:49.255
with non-union teachers
who make half as much.

09:49.338 --> 09:50.548
"Stand Behind Teachers"?

09:50.631 --> 09:54.552
More like, "Stand behind them so we can
kick them out the door," am I right?

09:59.932 --> 10:01.058
Are we done now?

10:02.268 --> 10:04.812
No, we're just getting started!

10:04.895 --> 10:07.523
There's the school board race,
the controller race...

10:07.607 --> 10:10.151
[gasps] ...and a very exciting
sewer tax initiative.

10:14.655 --> 10:18.951
Oh. Did you hear the knock?
I think there's somebody at the door.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.204
-I didn't hear anything.
-Coming!

10:23.289 --> 10:24.123
Oh!

10:26.459 --> 10:28.919
Don't you look pretty? [laughs]

10:29.503 --> 10:31.130
I know there's no one out there!

10:31.213 --> 10:33.299
Where did you get your hair done?

10:36.135 --> 10:38.804
See? Pretty great, right?

10:38.888 --> 10:40.640
Nothing keeps popcorn fresher

10:40.723 --> 10:43.225
than a shower cap you snagged
from a hotel room.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.774
But aren't we breaking the law
or something?

10:49.857 --> 10:51.317
I don't want to end up in jail.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.987
If the other prisoners ask me
what I'm in for and I say "gummy bears,"

10:55.321 --> 10:56.822
I don't see that ending well.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.410
There is no law against outside food.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.412
There's a rule,
but that's totally different.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.540
-It's okay to break the rules?
-Absolutely not.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.210
Unless the rule's nuts.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.212
Speaking of nuts...

11:13.130 --> 11:14.131
Goobers.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.260
They're so...

11:19.095 --> 11:20.221
warm.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.098
You're welcome.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.268
And we saved eight dollars.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.687
You know how much a box of Goobers
costs to make? A penny.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.065
-You really know that or--
-A penny!

11:33.401 --> 11:37.154
I scored these at a gas station on Pico.
Mislabeled at 49 cents!

11:37.238 --> 11:38.697
I bought every box.

11:39.448 --> 11:41.492
We're gonna be serving Goobers
at your wedding.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.661
I'm good with that.

11:45.162 --> 11:47.623
-You have any soda in your pants?
-No.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.041
[smacks lips] Aw.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.379
Ba-blam!

11:56.048 --> 12:00.261
No, no, no. The usher will hear you.
You have to wait for an explosion.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.473
-[explosion]
-[cans hissing]

12:18.612 --> 12:21.532
Come on, people, let's go!
We gotta get there before the polls close!

12:22.074 --> 12:23.701
They close in 11 hours.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.412
I'm excited, okay?

12:26.495 --> 12:28.581
I mean,  Abuelita's  never voted before.

12:29.039 --> 12:33.043
I can't wait for my first time.
And I hope I do it right.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.131
I was really hoping my first time
would be with Hillary,

12:37.214 --> 12:40.092
but I can picture myself doing it
with Elizabeth Warren.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.972
You and me both, sister.

12:46.682 --> 12:50.853
Hey, Mom, if you have time tonight,
maybe we can go see another movie?

12:51.479 --> 12:53.230
You want to hang out with me again?

12:54.190 --> 12:56.192
The movie's R-rated,
so I kind of need you.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.319
[chuckles]

12:58.694 --> 13:00.988
-But we had fun, right?
-Yes, we did.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.950
Abuelita,  come on! Where are you?

13:06.452 --> 13:08.329
I am right here.

13:10.247 --> 13:12.541
I am so sorry, everybody,

13:12.625 --> 13:17.421
but I'm having trouble walking,
and I cannot vote today.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.009
Oh, well, maybe next time.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.472
Come on,  Abuelita.  I was so
looking forward to taking you to vote.

13:26.555 --> 13:32.144
I know, and I am so disappointed
to miss it. Ah!

13:32.228 --> 13:35.356
You don't have to.
I have a wheelchair up in my apartment.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.194
I was Stephen Hawking for Halloween.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.741
[imitating Stephen Hawking]
People were offended.

13:46.909 --> 13:50.830
This is perfect!  Abuelita,  we can stop
to get Schneider's insensitive wheelchair,

13:50.913 --> 13:52.665
which I have a lot to say about,
just not now,

13:53.874 --> 13:55.459
and then we can head to the polls.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.086
-Let's go!
-[Schneider] All right.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.421
Great news!

13:59.505 --> 14:04.218
USA! USA! US...

14:06.262 --> 14:07.346
[lock rattling]

14:07.429 --> 14:10.808
What the hell is happening?
Why is she locking us out?

14:10.891 --> 14:13.727
-Schneider, I need your key.
-Sure. Here.

14:13.811 --> 14:17.648
Thank you. I've been trying to get this
away from you for two years.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.485
Nice try. These are all your apartment.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.199
-Mami!
-Abuelita!

14:27.283 --> 14:28.701
-Lydia?
- Abuelita!

14:28.784 --> 14:30.661
-She's probably in the kitchen.
- Abuelita?

14:31.704 --> 14:33.289
-[Alex]  Abuelita?
-[Schneider] Lydia?

14:33.372 --> 14:34.248
[Penelope]  Mami!

14:39.086 --> 14:39.962
Lydia?

14:53.934 --> 14:54.935
Mami?

14:59.189 --> 15:00.524
My leg is feeling better.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.235
[scoffs]

15:04.570 --> 15:07.531
Mami,  what's going on?
Why are you acting like such a  loca?

15:09.199 --> 15:10.826
Are you afraid to vote?

15:10.910 --> 15:13.871
I mean, is it because in Cuba,
any act of political expression

15:13.954 --> 15:15.748
was met with violent repercussions?

15:15.831 --> 15:17.499
Yeah, sure. Make that the reason.

15:19.752 --> 15:20.920
[speaking Spanish]

15:22.963 --> 15:23.797
Okay.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.383
[sighs and clears throat]

15:27.509 --> 15:29.803
I don't vote because...

15:32.640 --> 15:33.933
I am not a citizen.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.186
What?

15:38.771 --> 15:39.688
Yes, you are.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.274
You and  Papi  had
your citizenship interviews

15:42.358 --> 15:44.026
-while I was deployed in Afghanistan.
-No.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.694
We were supposed to, but we never did.

15:46.862 --> 15:53.077
We ended up spending the whole afternoon
in the park together, bird-watching.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.496
Which, of course,
is what we call lovemaking.

15:56.497 --> 15:57.373
Okay,  Mami.

15:57.456 --> 16:00.209
Which is ironic,
because the birds were watching us.

16:02.127 --> 16:06.507
Stop trying to change the subject.
Especially to that subject.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.510
How did you never become a citizen?

16:10.094 --> 16:11.971
I was busy, you know!

16:12.846 --> 16:19.186
I was working, raising a family,
helping my family to raise their family!

16:19.687 --> 16:21.021
Oh, you're welcome.

16:22.106 --> 16:26.402
But anyway, it doesn't matter
because I have a green card.

16:27.069 --> 16:30.155
I get social security, I pay taxes.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.533
Whoa. You have to pay taxes
with a green card?

16:34.118 --> 16:35.869
[groans loudly]

16:38.247 --> 16:40.916
I am a permanent resident.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.044
So it's almost the same thing.
It's no big deal.

16:44.128 --> 16:47.256
[sighs] This actually makes me
so much happier,  Abuelita.

16:47.339 --> 16:50.092
I understand. It's not that
you don't want to vote. You can't.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.636
-Yeah. Of course.
-Then this is great!

16:52.720 --> 16:55.305
Because green card holders
can become citizens easily.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.598
You just have to take tests.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.059
I'll download the forms. We'll get you
in line to become a citizen.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.561
No, thank you!

17:05.024 --> 17:06.650
She is so infuriating!

17:06.734 --> 17:08.777
I know, but right now she's embarrassed,

17:08.861 --> 17:11.655
and you being all over her
is not the answer. Let her calm down.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.866
I'm gonna go vote
in this very important election,

17:14.616 --> 17:16.035
and we're gonna talk later. Okay?

17:16.910 --> 17:18.746
-Okay?
-Yeah.

17:20.956 --> 17:24.126
Whoo! Okay, it's fine. I'm all good, guys!

17:25.627 --> 17:28.630
I texted my accountant, and he said
'cause I'm in the highest income bracket,

17:28.714 --> 17:30.549
I don't have to pay taxes. [laughs]

17:31.467 --> 17:35.637
USA! USA! USA! USA!

17:41.602 --> 17:43.020
[whispers] Do I look suspicious?

17:43.103 --> 17:45.981
No. You look very fashionable
for the '90s.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.984
Right here.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.362
Can't stop thinking about  Abuelita.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.948
I can't believe she never told us
she wasn't a citizen.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.451
[sighs] Some people
just carry around secrets.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.915
[dramatic music playing]

18:04.124 --> 18:05.793
[planes hovering]

18:06.627 --> 18:08.087
-[planes roar]
-[cans hissing]

18:11.298 --> 18:14.843
Perfect. Now let's break out
those hot dogs while they're still warm.

18:15.636 --> 18:18.013
Although, I could always warm 'em up.

18:24.978 --> 18:27.523
You're gonna love this.
I improved on what you taught me.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.233
They'll stay warm. I double-wrapped them

18:29.316 --> 18:31.360
-in wax paper and foil.
-Mmm.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.737
-[foil crinkling]
-No, don't! That's too loud.

18:35.489 --> 18:36.949
[exclaims]

18:37.032 --> 18:39.159
-It smells like bacon!
-I brought bacon.

18:39.243 --> 18:42.579
No! The usher's coming!
Get rid of that evidence! Give it.

18:48.752 --> 18:51.463
-Excuse me...
-Shh. Movie.

18:52.714 --> 18:56.260
Ma'am, we don't allow food that was
not purchased at our concession stand.

18:56.343 --> 18:59.471
[clicks tongue] Oh, shoot. [chuckles]

19:00.055 --> 19:02.099
I'm gonna have
to confiscate that food, ma'am.

19:02.182 --> 19:05.561
"Confiscate"? [scoffing] Okay, Officer.

19:09.231 --> 19:12.651
There's a jumbo soft pretzel in it for you
if you keep walking.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.822
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, ma'am.

19:17.489 --> 19:20.075
-[woman shushing]
-Seriously?

19:20.159 --> 19:22.035
[usher shushing]

19:27.124 --> 19:32.254
Let me tell you something.
I get that you're trying to do your job.

19:32.671 --> 19:36.842
But come on. I'm a mom out with my kid.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.677
[whispers] I don't know her.

19:39.803 --> 19:42.890
And yeah. Yeah, we broke your rules.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.852
But you know who else broke the rules?
Our founding fathers.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.104
[whispers] I really don't know her.

19:49.938 --> 19:52.065
-Security.
-No! So yeah, I will leave!

19:52.149 --> 19:53.192
I'm gonna leave.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.444
-But I will leave with my principles!
-[people shushing]

19:55.944 --> 19:57.529
And a fully-loaded baked potato!

19:59.615 --> 20:01.366
Thank you so much for dealing with that--

20:01.450 --> 20:02.910
Alex! Come on!

20:14.671 --> 20:16.423
[speaking Spanish]

20:22.638 --> 20:25.724
Perfecto.  And your accent is hysterical.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.102
Abuelita,  can we talk?

20:29.603 --> 20:31.146
[speaking Spanish]

20:33.523 --> 20:35.442
Okay. [speaking Spanish]

20:38.737 --> 20:41.240
[in English] Darn. I thought
that was going to get me out of it.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.869
Abuelita,  you need to become a citizen.
This is a big deal!

20:46.578 --> 20:48.497
Everything's a big deal to you!

20:48.580 --> 20:51.625
If I light a candle, I am killing the air.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.462
If I shop at Walmart,
I am killing mom and pop.

20:55.545 --> 20:59.800
If I cook pork, I am somehow killing pigs!

21:00.842 --> 21:02.219
What's going on here?

21:02.302 --> 21:04.554
Abuelita  won't even talk to me
about becoming a citizen.

21:04.638 --> 21:07.182
This is not a joke.
We live in very anti-immigrant times!

21:07.266 --> 21:09.434
Baby, it's not that serious.

21:09.518 --> 21:13.730
Yes, it is.
Carmen's parents weren't citizens.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.775
Yeah, but nothing like that's gonna
happen to  Abuelita.

21:16.858 --> 21:18.026
She's not gonna get deported.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.988
She could be.
They're deporting Cubans now, too.

21:21.071 --> 21:24.992
What? That doesn't make sense.
They should be importing us.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.870
Things keep changing.

21:29.496 --> 21:32.499
I mean, it's way worse
for some other groups, but still.

21:34.334 --> 21:38.046
Carmen lost her parents.
I lost my best friend.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.924
[stammers] And I just
don't want to lose you.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.552
[sighs]

21:44.386 --> 21:48.098
What if one day they decide to send all
non-citizens back to where they came from?

21:48.181 --> 21:51.101
No! I can't go back to Canada!

21:52.686 --> 21:54.271
It's just so cold!

21:58.108 --> 22:01.778
So become an American citizen.
Both of you.

22:03.488 --> 22:07.284
Elena's right,  Mami.  What's the problem?

22:07.993 --> 22:08.869
Hmm?

22:10.662 --> 22:16.835
-Don't you like being in this country?
-Of course. I like to be in America.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.466
[mimicking Lydia] I know you do.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.512
So what is the problem?

22:28.597 --> 22:34.102
When Berto and I learned that
in order to be sworn in as Americans,

22:34.186 --> 22:37.314
we would have to renounce
our Cuban citizenship,

22:38.190 --> 22:40.650
we could not bring ourselves to do it.

22:41.568 --> 22:47.032
-Cuba is home. Home-home.
-[sighs]

22:48.992 --> 22:51.244
But you've been here
for almost 60 years,  Mami.

22:51.328 --> 22:52.746
This is your home now.

22:53.246 --> 22:57.542
I know you miss Cuba. But you know
there's no going back, right?

22:57.626 --> 23:00.170
Even now that Castro's dead,
nothing has really changed.

23:00.253 --> 23:02.964
Yes. But you know, maybe someday it will.

23:03.465 --> 23:07.552
My  papi  made sure
that I had the deed to our house.

23:08.220 --> 23:12.391
And I still have it.
Just in case we ever go back there.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.102
Mami...

23:19.481 --> 23:23.401
I know. It's silly.

23:25.779 --> 23:29.449
But... becoming an American citizen

23:29.533 --> 23:33.161
would be like giving up.

23:35.789 --> 23:41.086
[sniffles] I just wish you could have
seen it like it was.

23:42.754 --> 23:43.672
[sighs deeply]

23:45.173 --> 23:51.388
I'm sorry. Being  cubana  is who I am.

23:54.391 --> 23:57.769
So much so, that I even bring it up
now and then.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.774
That will never change.

24:04.359 --> 24:06.736
That's what we are. Me, Elena, Alex.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.823
You brought Cuba here
and you gave it to us.

24:10.407 --> 24:13.952
It's true. Whenever someone asks me
what I am, I always say I'm Cuban.

24:14.035 --> 24:15.704
I don't even think about it.

24:15.787 --> 24:18.290
Yeah. When people ask me what I am, I say,

24:18.373 --> 24:20.292
"I'm a human being...

24:22.627 --> 24:26.298
not defined by labels
or the artificial construct of borders."

24:32.721 --> 24:34.431
But I also say I'm Cuban.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.018
So please,  Abuelita.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.395
I hear what you are saying.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.486
And I love you.

24:50.989 --> 24:55.035
And... I will think about it.

24:58.747 --> 24:59.623
[sighs]

25:00.540 --> 25:04.377
Well, I've made my decision.
I'm gonna become a citizen.

25:04.461 --> 25:08.006
Now, the English test should be a breeze,
but as far as the civics test goes,

25:08.089 --> 25:10.550
I'd better put on my thinkin' toque,
stock up on Timmies

25:10.634 --> 25:12.135
and study like a real keener, eh?

25:16.890 --> 25:20.727
I don't mind people moving here.
I just wish they'd learn the language.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.983
-[dramatic music playing on TV]
-[can hissing]

25:29.653 --> 25:31.154
What the hell am I doing?

25:32.864 --> 25:35.242
Hey, I've been thinking about
what happened at the movies.

25:35.325 --> 25:36.243
[scoffs]

25:36.326 --> 25:39.162
Me, too,  papito.  And I'm so sorry
I put you through all that.

25:39.913 --> 25:42.540
And I didn't have to go back
to take all those ketchup packets,

25:42.624 --> 25:45.710
but what, are we gonna buy Heinz
at the store like the king of England?

25:47.587 --> 25:49.381
It's okay.
You taught me something important.

25:49.923 --> 25:50.757
Good.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.342
I need to get a job and work hard

25:52.425 --> 25:55.762
so I can buy real snacks
and avoid looking like a total nutjob.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.475
That's exactly the point
I was trying to teach you.

26:01.351 --> 26:05.272
Mom, have you seen  Abuelita?  Prop U passed
and I want to tell her the good news.

26:05.355 --> 26:06.690
I don't know where she is.

26:06.773 --> 26:09.109
[Latin music playing on speakers]
