WEBVTT

00:02.212 --> 00:03.088
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:03.254 --> 00:05.507
How I ever let him lay a hand on me...

00:08.968 --> 00:10.303
<i>I'm glad he's out of your life.</i>

00:11.596 --> 00:13.807
Keep that guard up! Jab, jab.
Lead jab, jab, right.

00:14.099 --> 00:16.101
- What are you doing?
- Alfred's teaching me to fight.

00:16.309 --> 00:17.602
I need you to take me
to the Pike brothers.

00:17.769 --> 00:18.770
The firebugs from the Narrows?

00:19.229 --> 00:20.605
<i>I used to hang with their sister, Bridgit.</i>

00:20.772 --> 00:23.775
Hey, boys. We need the best,
and you guys are the best.

00:24.442 --> 00:26.569
<i>Bridgy. You just got a promotion.</i>

00:29.906 --> 00:31.241
- G.C.P.D.!
- Run!

00:34.744 --> 00:36.579
- I've got her! Drop it!
- No!

00:37.414 --> 00:38.873
No!

00:39.708 --> 00:41.292
One moment, Mr. Penguin.

00:42.001 --> 00:44.546
- Mother!
<i>- Please! I don't know nothing.</i>

00:44.754 --> 00:46.005
You are going to go to Galavan.

00:46.172 --> 00:48.967
Once you're inside his organization,
you will find my mother and rescue her.

00:49.134 --> 00:50.927
He'll buy it, if we sell it right.

00:57.267 --> 00:58.935
And then Penguin just went crazy.

01:00.311 --> 01:03.523
I mean, like,
crazier than I've ever seen him.

01:04.983 --> 01:07.861
He said it was me
that set up the count house raid.

01:08.027 --> 01:09.904
Said I was a traitor and a rat.

01:11.823 --> 01:14.409
And he came at me with a cleaver.

01:15.785 --> 01:19.581
I tried to protect myself
and he did this, that sick bastard.

01:23.168 --> 01:24.419
How'd you get away?

01:24.586 --> 01:27.422
<i>There was a lot of blood. A lot.</i>

01:27.589 --> 01:32.135
<i>And he tried to take another swing and
he slipped and fell, and so I just ran.</i>

01:32.302 --> 01:37.682
And I ran and I ran and then, next thing
I knew, I woke up in the hospital.

01:39.684 --> 01:40.727
Hmm.

01:42.187 --> 01:46.441
Give me a shot, Mr. Galavan,
let me show you what I can do.

01:47.192 --> 01:49.569
Well, I'd like to help you out, Butch,

01:50.195 --> 01:54.949
but I already have several capable
two-handed thugs in my employ.

01:55.116 --> 01:58.953
They don't know Gotham like I do.
I got brains, you ask anyone!

01:59.954 --> 02:01.164
What do you think, ladies?

02:02.373 --> 02:05.043
I think he's cute. Like a sad bear.

02:07.879 --> 02:10.381
I suppose he's telling the truth.

02:10.673 --> 02:13.802
<i>The little man was cracking up
last time I saw him.</i>

02:14.886 --> 02:16.346
He was very mean to me once.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.973
<i>Held me hostage in my own apartment.</i>

02:19.140 --> 02:23.311
Said some nasty things.
Isn't that right, Stumpy?

02:23.603 --> 02:25.730
That's right, ma'am. And I'm sorry for it.

02:27.857 --> 02:29.150
<i>Business is business, you know?</i>

02:30.401 --> 02:33.738
Please. Let me work for you, Mr. Galavan.

02:35.490 --> 02:37.408
I got nobody else to turn to.

02:38.034 --> 02:39.285
Oh, yes!

02:40.578 --> 02:45.250
We can put cool things on his stump,
like knives and mallets and stuff.

02:46.209 --> 02:47.210
Ooh!

02:47.710 --> 02:49.963
How about a little tiny chainsaw?

02:50.380 --> 02:51.589
Yes!

02:51.840 --> 02:52.841
Huh.

02:54.133 --> 02:57.011
Well, that settles it.
Welcome aboard, Butch.

02:57.679 --> 02:58.972
Thank you, sir.

03:00.849 --> 03:06.271
Oh! Oh! Bravo, Congressman. Well saved.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.940
You really are quite spry for a big man.

03:09.774 --> 03:11.985
Have you reconsidered your position?

03:12.777 --> 03:15.029
Can I count on your support this election?

03:15.321 --> 03:18.324
Yes, yes! You have my full support!

03:18.867 --> 03:19.951
Thank you so much.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.114
Freeze!

04:02.869 --> 04:04.829
Man, I didn't do nothing!
Why are you chasing me?

04:05.079 --> 04:06.539
A police officer died last night.

04:06.706 --> 04:10.543
Killed by a firebug crew on a spree.
You're a firebug, aren't you?

04:10.710 --> 04:12.670
No, man, I been out the game a long time!

04:15.882 --> 04:17.634
- Don't lie to me, Nino.
- I swear.

04:18.009 --> 04:19.802
Sir, that's a violation
of the officer conduct regs.

04:20.011 --> 04:22.513
Luke Garrett burned to death
in front of me twelve hours ago.

04:22.805 --> 04:24.182
I'll conduct myself as I see fit.

04:25.516 --> 04:29.354
This crew's working with a kid. A girl.
Wears a homemade fire suit.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.148
Hey, for real, never heard
of a female firebug before.

04:32.732 --> 04:35.068
It's mad rare, like a...
Like a unicorn or something.

04:47.872 --> 04:51.709
Sir, Captain Barnes says
we must report any infractions.

04:53.211 --> 04:54.629
Even by superior officers.

04:54.796 --> 04:55.880
You do that.

05:04.847 --> 05:06.474
What are you doing?

05:09.519 --> 05:12.021
I can't sleep.
I don't know what to do with myself.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.901
That's the point of being free.

05:17.694 --> 05:19.362
You get to do whatever the hell you want.

05:19.529 --> 05:20.697
What am I gonna do?

05:21.739 --> 05:25.827
I killed someone last night.
I can't go home. I can't go to the police.

05:25.994 --> 05:26.995
You gotta get out of town.

05:27.161 --> 05:29.497
How? I got no money.

05:33.084 --> 05:36.087
No problem. We'll get some.

05:37.422 --> 05:39.048
You mean, like, crime?

05:39.632 --> 05:41.718
Man, you are square.

05:46.097 --> 05:47.724
I guess I got no choice.

05:50.601 --> 05:51.894
Why are you helping me?

05:52.937 --> 05:54.355
Maybe you remind me of me

05:55.773 --> 05:56.941
if I was a doofus.

05:59.986 --> 06:03.322
This crime...
What exactly you got in mind?

06:10.413 --> 06:11.789
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

06:12.248 --> 06:14.751
Or should I say pimps, hos and thieves?

06:14.917 --> 06:16.836
Do I have some product for you today!

06:17.336 --> 06:18.629
Do you like what you see?

06:18.796 --> 06:20.339
Come on, now, let me hear you!

06:20.506 --> 06:21.966
Do you like what you see?

06:23.718 --> 06:29.432
All right. Oh, check it out, check it out!
Yes! Nice and sturdy

06:29.599 --> 06:32.018
- I want her!
- Bidding will start at $800 apiece!

06:33.144 --> 06:35.146
- And we got $800! Can I get--
- Yo, $850!

06:35.313 --> 06:37.982
We got $850. Can I get $900?
Can I get nine?

06:40.026 --> 06:41.694
Those girls are for sale?

06:42.695 --> 06:44.238
Told you this place was freaky.

06:46.699 --> 06:47.825
We need to help them.

06:49.368 --> 06:52.997
We're here to help you.
'Cause you killed a cop, remember?

06:53.164 --> 06:54.749
We get the money, we go.

06:54.916 --> 06:56.834
- But--
- Listen. Listen.

07:02.173 --> 07:06.094
You go down the stairs.
The lock on the back door is busted.

07:06.260 --> 07:11.057
I know, 'cause I busted it.
You go in, wait for me to make my move.

07:11.557 --> 07:12.600
How will I know when?

07:13.810 --> 07:14.852
Pay attention.

07:22.985 --> 07:26.656
Sold for $2,500
to the gentleman in the burgundy hat!

07:26.823 --> 07:28.866
Yes, indeedy! Come on, ladies.

07:29.408 --> 07:30.910
<i>Found you a nice new home!</i>

07:31.077 --> 07:34.372
<i>Oh, you'll be very satisfied!
You'll be very, very satisfied!</i>

07:35.039 --> 07:38.876
<i>Next up, check her out as she walks
down the stage, see how graceful she is!</i>

07:39.043 --> 07:40.378
<i>Look at this one!</i>

07:41.712 --> 07:43.422
<i>I'll start the bidding here at $900!</i>

07:43.589 --> 07:46.551
<i>Can I get $900? $900 over here.</i>

07:48.469 --> 07:51.389
Hey, pervs! This is a robbery!

07:52.390 --> 07:53.933
Milo! Kill that punk!

08:00.314 --> 08:01.899
She's with me.

08:03.234 --> 08:07.321
Now, each of you
put all your cash in the bag.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.657
Or what? I ain't scared of you.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.126
Yeah, all right.

08:21.169 --> 08:24.255
Anybody else got a problem?
Yeah, I didn't think so.

08:29.552 --> 08:32.930
And for the record, all y'all suck!

08:44.233 --> 08:47.111
Come on! Please! Get me out of here!

08:49.113 --> 08:50.448
<i>I can't stay here.</i>

08:54.076 --> 08:56.120
Hey, you! Hey! Stop!

09:03.461 --> 09:05.046
Oh, my God.

09:05.213 --> 09:07.423
I know, right? Let's go!

09:12.803 --> 09:15.097
A note in my file? Are you serious?

09:15.473 --> 09:16.974
Do I look like I'm joking?

09:18.768 --> 09:21.187
We do not beat suspects. Ever!

09:26.317 --> 09:29.320
I get it. Luke was a good kid.

09:29.487 --> 09:32.740
We took him out of the academy.
Told him he was ready. Now he's dead.

09:32.907 --> 09:34.825
You lose people in war. You know that.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.620
<i>Make no mistake, this is war.</i>

09:38.371 --> 09:41.040
But that doesn't give you or me
the license to break the law.

09:41.499 --> 09:44.710
There's a line.
I learned that the hard way.

09:47.088 --> 09:49.215
Respectfully, sir, this is Gotham.

09:50.258 --> 09:53.928
There are gray areas.
I've learned that the hard way, too.

09:55.346 --> 09:58.599
And did you even get a lead
while you were out avenging Luke?

09:58.849 --> 09:59.892
No, sir.

10:00.059 --> 10:02.478
"No, sir." Well, you got one now.

10:05.314 --> 10:06.732
Bodega owner called this in.

10:06.899 --> 10:08.567
His security camera caught it.

10:09.318 --> 10:12.029
She's our firefly.
We don't know who the other one is.

10:21.580 --> 10:24.375
I do. Damn it.

10:34.135 --> 10:37.596
Focus. Focus. Keep your head down.

10:37.763 --> 10:40.975
Head down! Distractions will be
the death of you, Master Bruce.

10:42.852 --> 10:44.937
Now, get on your toes. On your toes. Move!

10:46.731 --> 10:50.776
Well, don't dance around
like a bloody showgirl. Come on.

10:51.402 --> 10:55.614
That's better. Better.
Now, big left. Big left. Go on.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.033
Right. I've got you!

10:57.533 --> 10:58.951
- Now, your enemies...
- Hey!

10:59.118 --> 11:00.953
...are gonna fight
a lot dirtier than that.

11:02.288 --> 11:03.831
Ow! Ow!

11:05.833 --> 11:06.917
Bloody hell.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.172
Very good, Master Bruce.

11:12.757 --> 11:13.758
Eh?

11:14.091 --> 11:15.926
Have you spoken to Mr. Fox
about the computer?

11:16.093 --> 11:17.136
That I have, yeah.

11:17.303 --> 11:18.429
How much longer till it's fixed?

11:20.139 --> 11:21.724
I'll tell you when it's done,
won't I? Patience.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.060
I'm tired of patience, Alfred.
I'm ready to begin!

11:24.310 --> 11:26.729
I'll tell you when you're ready,
Master Bruce.

11:26.896 --> 11:28.272
I'm ready now. I know I am.

11:29.565 --> 11:31.859
Oh, by the way, by the way,
Miss Silver called.

11:32.026 --> 11:33.486
She wants you
to go for dinner this evening.

11:36.447 --> 11:38.282
- Silver called?
- Yeah.

11:43.162 --> 11:45.664
Told you. Not ready.

11:51.962 --> 11:53.005
- Let's go.
- Left.

11:54.965 --> 11:57.009
<i>Well, he just up
and moved out of town.</i>

11:57.176 --> 11:58.969
<i>It was rude and inconsiderate.</i>

11:59.136 --> 12:01.097
<i>And perfectly in character
for Tom Dougherty.</i>

12:01.389 --> 12:02.640
Do you ever wonder where he went?

12:02.932 --> 12:05.351
He could be dead in a ditch,
for all I care.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.686
<i>- Kristen!
- And I mean it, too.</i>

12:08.396 --> 12:10.898
He, um... He wasn't very nice to me.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.859
That's awful. I'm so sorry.

12:14.110 --> 12:15.319
<i>Thank you</i>.

12:16.362 --> 12:18.614
<i>But it all worked out for the best.</i>

12:19.115 --> 12:21.867
<i>I know!
You and Ed seem to be getting along.</i>

12:23.160 --> 12:25.162
He is so gentle and kind.

12:26.831 --> 12:28.332
Almost too gentle.

12:28.833 --> 12:32.503
<i>I think a man needs to have a little fire,</i>

12:32.670 --> 12:34.338
<i>a little danger in him, don't you think?</i>

12:34.755 --> 12:36.507
Oh, I don't know about that.

12:38.217 --> 12:42.012
And sometimes I feel like
he's holding something back from me.

12:42.596 --> 12:43.639
<i>Like a secret?</i>

12:44.223 --> 12:45.933
I don't know.

12:46.642 --> 12:48.853
I just... I guess, I just wish
he would open up a little more.

12:53.524 --> 12:56.068
Good morning!
Miss Kringle, Miss Thompkins.

12:57.194 --> 12:58.237
Hi.

12:58.487 --> 12:59.613
What do you call a three-legged cow?

12:59.864 --> 13:01.907
- I am terrible with--
- Lean beef!

13:03.033 --> 13:04.702
Or supper. At my place.

13:07.371 --> 13:09.707
Oh, Ed.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.005
Aw

13:18.716 --> 13:22.011
Ginger to ginger, we both know
you know where Selina Kyle's at.

13:22.178 --> 13:25.848
So, why don't you tell me now
and save us the hassle?

13:26.390 --> 13:27.808
Who's Selina Kyle?

13:28.058 --> 13:29.935
- Cat.
- Cat?

13:30.978 --> 13:34.523
Look, Ivy, want me to call the children's
home and have 'em come get you now?

13:35.649 --> 13:38.819
Or should I get a candy bar
and forget to have someone watch you?

13:40.738 --> 13:42.239
Candy bar.

13:43.407 --> 13:46.994
I struck out. None of the street kids
I talked to have seen Selina.

13:47.161 --> 13:49.079
Relax. Your Uncle Harvey has you covered.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.790
She's in a squat off Jenkins.
Condemned SRO.

13:52.416 --> 13:53.584
I know it.

13:54.126 --> 13:57.713
Hey, last time we saw this chick,
she had a shotgun pointed at us.

13:57.922 --> 13:59.924
Maybe you should take
the Fascist youth, huh?

14:00.591 --> 14:03.469
Nah, with Selina, it's best to go quietly.

14:03.719 --> 14:04.887
Come on!

14:09.517 --> 14:13.437
When you get to the bus station,
take the first bus south.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.773
Stay on till the end of the line.

14:16.273 --> 14:17.733
Well, what do I do then?

14:17.900 --> 14:19.944
You got plenty of money.
You can do what you like.

14:21.737 --> 14:25.866
Thank you. For everything.
You've been a really good friend.

14:26.534 --> 14:29.537
I got my cut. No biggie.

14:38.462 --> 14:41.006
Bridgit, you need to run!
Bridgit, run! Run!

14:41.215 --> 14:46.595
- Bridgit!
- No! Selina! No! Selina! No! No!

14:52.768 --> 14:55.104
<i>Help me! No! Stop!</i>

14:55.729 --> 14:56.730
Hey!

15:29.096 --> 15:30.097
Hands in the air!

15:37.187 --> 15:39.106
- Drop the gun.
- Like hell I will.

15:40.566 --> 15:42.276
- Where's your girlfriend?
- Who?

15:42.818 --> 15:44.028
We got both of you on tape.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.821
Don't know what you're
talking about, Gordon.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.700
She's burned down half a dozen buildings.

15:50.743 --> 15:53.162
Killed a cop.
You're running with a bad partner, kid.

15:53.329 --> 15:56.248
You don't understand.
She was forced to do all of that!

16:01.462 --> 16:02.630
Okay.

16:06.467 --> 16:10.888
Let me help her. Who is she?
Who's forcing her to do this?

16:15.684 --> 16:17.853
Look, there's a lot of
angry cops out there.

16:18.896 --> 16:21.940
She's gonna get shot on sight
unless I get to her first.

16:28.572 --> 16:30.324
Her name is Bridgit Pike.

16:31.492 --> 16:34.411
Her brothers took her back.
Joe and Cale Pike.

16:34.578 --> 16:36.413
They, like, kidnapped her.

16:37.164 --> 16:40.125
They're the ones who made her
start burning stuff in the first place.

16:40.292 --> 16:41.919
It's their fault the cop died!

16:42.753 --> 16:43.921
The Pike brothers?

16:44.838 --> 16:48.384
Why'd they burn down Wayne
Enterprises' buildings? Who paid them?

16:48.550 --> 16:50.302
Why the hell should I know
why the Pikes do anything?

16:50.469 --> 16:51.553
They're freaking nuts.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.931
They treated Bridgit like a slave,
chained her to the wall.

16:54.098 --> 16:56.600
And you're angry about it.
Is that why you're armed?

16:56.767 --> 16:59.269
You gonna go after the Pikes?
Rescue your friend?

16:59.728 --> 17:01.438
- No.
- That's a yes.

17:02.106 --> 17:06.276
Look, you're gonna get your friend and
yourself killed. Let me handle the Pikes.

17:07.403 --> 17:11.532
No offense, Jim, but I like
my chances better than yours.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.786
Why get involved? Why risk your neck?

17:16.453 --> 17:17.538
Who is this girl to you?

17:17.746 --> 17:22.084
No one. Just a girl in the neighborhood.

17:26.130 --> 17:29.842
I give you my word, I will do
everything I can to keep her safe.

17:30.634 --> 17:33.011
<i>But you have to stay out of it.</i>

17:34.304 --> 17:35.597
Tell me where she is.

17:40.602 --> 17:43.814
Damn. She's got six grand here.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.108
Little Bridgy put on her big-girl pants.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.318
You can take all of it, I don't care.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.529
Oh, I'm taking it. That's not the issue.

17:50.696 --> 17:54.616
The issue is you thinking it's cool
to just ditch your brothers. Hmm?

17:57.745 --> 18:00.164
Oh, snap! Bridgit's gonna get it!

18:00.831 --> 18:01.832
Joe, please...

18:04.084 --> 18:07.129
Did you even think about us, hmm?
Did you even think how we would feel?

18:07.296 --> 18:11.216
No, don't!
Joe, I didn't mean anything by it!

18:12.926 --> 18:15.179
I'm a sensitive guy
and you hurt my feelings.

18:17.848 --> 18:19.683
I mean, without family, what do you got?

18:19.850 --> 18:21.727
You got nothing, right?

18:22.019 --> 18:23.437
You wanna be part of the family again?

18:29.693 --> 18:30.903
I said...

18:33.697 --> 18:36.033
Do you feel like
being part of this family again?

18:39.286 --> 18:40.287
Yes!

18:40.662 --> 18:45.334
Damn! Damn,
that hurt! Bridgit's back.

18:51.048 --> 18:53.884
If you try anything like that again,
I'll kill you.

18:54.051 --> 18:59.556
And I'll skin that little cat-bitch, too,
you hear me? You're never leaving.

19:00.933 --> 19:01.975
Yes.

19:02.226 --> 19:06.772
Good. Go make our supper.
All right, let's pack it up.

19:20.911 --> 19:26.583
Dear me. A mallet. That's, um... Useful?

19:27.251 --> 19:28.460
Don't even start.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.380
Tell me you bring good news.

19:32.548 --> 19:34.675
I'm in. I'm in good.

19:34.925 --> 19:36.385
And? And?

19:36.927 --> 19:39.763
I'm asking questions. But it's dangerous.

19:39.930 --> 19:44.059
If I push too hard, Galavan will be
onto me. I told you, he's a smart guy.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.230
Look at me, Butch.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.275
Are you my servant?

19:53.694 --> 19:54.778
Yes.

19:55.279 --> 19:57.322
Do you obey me in all things?

19:57.614 --> 19:58.824
Yes.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.702
Then why do you bring me excuses?

20:03.161 --> 20:07.457
Go find my mother
before I chop off your other hand.

20:09.668 --> 20:10.961
Yes, boss.

20:15.966 --> 20:17.342
Come on, harder!

20:23.307 --> 20:24.433
Come on, Joe.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.150
What are you gonna do? Kill us?

20:33.942 --> 20:35.152
Yep.

20:43.619 --> 20:45.120
Oh, God!

21:01.845 --> 21:03.347
I'll check the other room.

21:13.273 --> 21:16.526
Clear! She's not here.

21:17.110 --> 21:20.948
Damn. I hate how it
smells like good barbecue.

21:24.034 --> 21:25.035
Bitch.

21:27.955 --> 21:29.206
Bullock! Hey!

21:29.539 --> 21:32.042
What? He scared the hell out of me.

21:39.633 --> 21:41.802
And now he's dead. Nice work, Bullock.

21:41.969 --> 21:42.970
Oh, yeah, my kicks did it?

21:43.136 --> 21:45.138
Maybe it's because
he's fried like a taquito!

21:47.516 --> 21:49.059
- It's not on me.
- Uh-huh.

21:50.727 --> 21:52.729
Looks like Selina was telling the truth.

21:55.023 --> 21:58.527
Look, I don't want to speak ill of the
dead, but these ass-hats had it coming.

21:58.735 --> 22:01.697
These ass-hats were professional
arsonists. Somebody hired them.

22:02.072 --> 22:03.365
But why Wayne Enterprises?

22:03.573 --> 22:04.950
Who cares? All right?

22:05.158 --> 22:08.870
There's a freaky firefly chick
on the loose with a flamethrower.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.747
Let's start there.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.100
Hallelujah.

22:36.481 --> 22:38.442
<i>Hello, Butch.
Sorry to keep you waiting.</i>

22:40.027 --> 22:41.653
I just wanted to check in.

22:42.279 --> 22:44.698
See how things were going. Any complaints?

22:44.865 --> 22:47.200
No. No, sir.
I'm fine like a bottle of wine.

22:47.367 --> 22:49.745
Good.

22:52.914 --> 22:54.583
You could have a real future here.

22:55.459 --> 22:58.503
<i>You are a hard worker,
and you're loyal to a fault.</i>

22:58.670 --> 22:59.921
Thank you, boss.

23:00.297 --> 23:02.424
If only you were loyal to me.

23:04.801 --> 23:07.304
I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:07.471 --> 23:09.973
Come on, Butch, have some dignity.
I know what you were doing.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.392
You were looking for Penguin's mother,
weren't you?

23:12.976 --> 23:16.229
The hand was a nice touch.
Almost fooled me.

23:16.813 --> 23:20.859
How on Earth did Penguin
get you to do that?

23:21.860 --> 23:25.155
I'm his servant.
I have to obey him in all things.

23:26.156 --> 23:27.991
Penguin's done a number on you, huh?

23:28.825 --> 23:30.577
<i>Tinkered with your wiring.</i>

23:32.204 --> 23:38.168
Perhaps we can help. Tabby?
Tabby, could you come here, please?

23:42.380 --> 23:45.342
Penguin has brainwashed this poor soul.

23:46.426 --> 23:47.511
Can we help?

23:47.719 --> 23:49.262
Be my pleasure.

23:51.181 --> 23:53.058
All right, look, let's...
Let's talk about this.

23:53.225 --> 23:56.978
Can we talk about this?
Take it easy, what are you doing?

23:57.604 --> 24:00.565
Relax. We just want to help.

24:17.707 --> 24:21.503
I'll leave you two to it.
Uh, remember, dinner's in an hour.

24:34.057 --> 24:36.643
We've set up a perimeter.
She can't have gotten far.

24:36.810 --> 24:38.311
And we're sitting on Selina Kyle's place.

24:38.645 --> 24:39.729
Keep me posted.

24:46.069 --> 24:48.238
Bridgit Pike was abused her whole life.

24:48.488 --> 24:53.076
Forced to set those fires. I promised
my informant I would keep her safe.

24:56.621 --> 24:59.958
Weren't you the one saying
that Luke Garrett was just a kid?

25:00.292 --> 25:01.877
That we owe him justice?

25:02.419 --> 25:04.254
- I know that's what I said--
- And you were right.

25:05.297 --> 25:09.801
And now she killed him.
Now she has two more dead bodies on her.

25:10.093 --> 25:12.971
So I don't care about the hows
and the whys and the boohoos.

25:13.263 --> 25:15.265
<i>You don't make promises you can't keep.</i>

25:16.141 --> 25:19.728
Now, you find her and
you take her down. Clear?

25:20.270 --> 25:21.438
Yes, sir.

25:46.254 --> 25:49.507
We must have spent years up here,
watching these birds.

25:51.885 --> 25:54.971
Remember when Mickey Slattery
called us orphan bastards

25:55.222 --> 25:56.765
and we tried to throw him off the roof?

26:00.435 --> 26:03.730
The cops are outside my place.
You need to get out of town.

26:04.022 --> 26:05.106
I'm not scared of them.

26:05.273 --> 26:07.234
Bridgit, I know what you did
to your brothers.

26:07.484 --> 26:11.321
Not that they didn't deserve it, but...
Whoa.

26:12.072 --> 26:13.865
I was surprised.

26:14.157 --> 26:17.786
Cale flamed up good, but it was Joe
who burned the brightest.

26:19.079 --> 26:20.247
You don't sound like yourself.

26:20.413 --> 26:25.418
I'm not myself anymore. I'm free.
Just like you told me I was.

26:26.461 --> 26:27.587
So what are you gonna do?

26:28.213 --> 26:29.547
I'm gonna go after the rest of them.

26:29.756 --> 26:30.799
The rest of who?

26:30.966 --> 26:35.303
The pervs and the bullies.
The ones who hurt people like us.

26:35.762 --> 26:38.014
No one's ever gone after me or hurt me.

26:38.473 --> 26:40.183
Yeah, right.

26:41.601 --> 26:46.231
Rule number one, look after number one.
That's you.

26:47.357 --> 26:50.860
Don't be crazy,
or you'll get yourself killed.

26:51.027 --> 26:54.447
Don't worry about me, Selina.
This is what I was meant to do.

26:54.614 --> 26:56.199
Bridgit, please, don't do this.

26:58.159 --> 27:01.538
It's nice to have someone
who cares about me. Thank you.

27:02.914 --> 27:05.959
I don't care.
I just think you're being dumb.

27:06.710 --> 27:10.130
But... Hey. Good luck.

27:22.851 --> 27:24.394
I'll see you around.

27:42.537 --> 27:43.580
A toast.

27:45.582 --> 27:46.750
I'm so sorry.

27:48.585 --> 27:50.128
Something came up last minute.

27:57.260 --> 27:58.762
As I was saying...

28:00.347 --> 28:01.723
- To family.
- Mmm.

28:02.807 --> 28:05.268
In the end, it's all that matters.

28:08.605 --> 28:09.939
Family.

28:14.694 --> 28:18.073
I hope, in time, you'll come to think
of us as family, Bruce.

28:19.699 --> 28:22.577
Thank you. It's...

28:23.119 --> 28:25.830
It's been some time
since I had a meal like this.

28:26.081 --> 28:27.290
You mean with girls?

28:29.084 --> 28:32.712
You should come over more often.
We can, like, hang out or whatever.

28:33.088 --> 28:34.672
I'd like that.

28:35.507 --> 28:39.052
Look how cute they are.
Don't you just want to eat them?

28:39.386 --> 28:42.097
Tabitha, leave the young people alone.

28:42.263 --> 28:44.641
Well, they are cute, and they know it.

28:56.820 --> 29:00.073
These were the best
mashed potatoes I have ever had.

29:00.448 --> 29:01.991
I swear I'm gonna get plump.

29:02.158 --> 29:03.535
I like that you have an appetite.

29:03.952 --> 29:05.245
Stop it, you're spoiling me.

29:05.412 --> 29:08.706
I won't stop it.
I want nothing more than to spoil you.

29:09.082 --> 29:12.710
Oh... Ed! So forceful.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.632
There's something else
that I want to tell you.

29:19.175 --> 29:22.512
But I just...
I don't want to scare you away.

29:23.388 --> 29:26.057
Please. Tell me anything.
Do not hold back.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.198
Kristen...

29:43.950 --> 29:45.243
I like you very much.

29:45.452 --> 29:48.079
I... I feel the same way about you.

29:48.413 --> 29:49.414
And, um...

29:49.622 --> 29:51.207
"And..." Shh.

30:10.518 --> 30:14.898
Mr. Nygma, is that your bedroom
over there?

30:20.111 --> 30:21.905
Why, yes, it is.

30:29.537 --> 30:31.789
Gordon, phone call for you.

30:34.834 --> 30:35.919
This is Gordon.

30:36.586 --> 30:37.921
Do you remember your promise?

30:39.088 --> 30:40.298
Yes.

30:41.966 --> 30:43.593
I think I know where she's going.

30:56.272 --> 30:58.107
No! No, please!

30:58.274 --> 31:02.904
Go! Go! Go! Just go! Go! Go!

31:03.780 --> 31:04.948
Help me!

31:05.240 --> 31:06.241
Come on!

31:06.491 --> 31:09.369
All right! Go, go, go!

31:18.670 --> 31:22.048
All right, no one gets hurt tonight.
We follow protocols and stay safe.

31:22.215 --> 31:23.466
Yes, sir.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.677
Freeze! Hands in the air!

31:26.135 --> 31:27.136
Hold your fire!

31:29.639 --> 31:30.807
Bridgit Pike?

31:31.099 --> 31:32.308
Stay away!

31:33.851 --> 31:35.019
My name's Jim Gordon.

31:38.231 --> 31:39.732
I know what your brothers did to you.

31:41.651 --> 31:43.319
I know you didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

31:43.820 --> 31:45.280
You don't know anything.

31:45.697 --> 31:49.534
You put your weapon down and come with me,
I can help you.

31:50.618 --> 31:52.120
<i>There are places you can go.</i>

31:52.287 --> 31:53.621
I'm not going to jail!

31:54.163 --> 31:57.292
You're a juvenile,
we can work something out.

32:00.628 --> 32:02.505
- Wait, wait!
- I said hold your fire!

32:10.805 --> 32:13.349
Bridgit! Stop!

32:14.309 --> 32:15.602
Take cover!

32:26.237 --> 32:28.031
Bridgit! Wait!

32:53.097 --> 32:57.852
I'm glad we have a moment alone.
There is something I need to discuss.

32:58.811 --> 32:59.979
Oh?

33:01.105 --> 33:05.151
An executive at Wayne Enterprises
has been reported missing.

33:05.735 --> 33:08.780
Sid Bunderslaw. Do you know him?

33:10.281 --> 33:13.910
Yes. We've met several times.

33:15.119 --> 33:16.245
What happened?

33:16.412 --> 33:18.873
No one knows. But it doesn't look good.

33:19.248 --> 33:20.291
How did you hear?

33:20.541 --> 33:22.418
Let's just say
I have friends in high places.

33:22.627 --> 33:26.255
And I've been following the goings-on
at Wayne Enterprises very closely.

33:27.674 --> 33:28.758
What have you learned?

33:28.925 --> 33:32.303
That your father was a good man.
A great man, even.

33:33.262 --> 33:36.808
But in spite of that,
bad things happened at his company.

33:43.064 --> 33:44.357
Unfortunately, I think you're right.

33:44.524 --> 33:46.776
I can tell you're very mature
for your age.

33:47.568 --> 33:50.697
Ready to tackle the problems
of your company head-on.

33:51.781 --> 33:56.953
But you'll need help. Once I'm mayor,
I would very much like to be that person.

34:01.457 --> 34:06.212
Thank you, Mr. Galavan. I appreciate it.

34:17.890 --> 34:20.143
Butch? What has happened?

34:20.935 --> 34:21.978
I found your mother.

34:22.562 --> 34:23.646
Where?

34:23.813 --> 34:26.774
In a warehouse down by the port.
But they caught me looking.

34:27.191 --> 34:29.694
You half-wit, if they kill my mother--

34:29.861 --> 34:31.028
Look, they don't know I'm here.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.906
The tiger lady, she wanted to take
her time with me, so she chained me up.

34:34.073 --> 34:36.826
And I got out. We gotta go now.

34:39.162 --> 34:42.957
Yes. Yes. Yes. Good, Butch.

34:43.499 --> 34:49.338
You've done well. Your loyalty will
be rewarded handsomely. I swear it.

34:50.298 --> 34:51.340
Yes, boss.

34:51.549 --> 34:55.762
Rest here for a minute
and I'll go gather the troops.

35:03.644 --> 35:04.937
<i>How old are you?</i>

35:05.480 --> 35:07.982
Old enough to shoot you,
if that's what you're thinking.

35:08.691 --> 35:10.610
No, that's not what I was thinking.

35:11.319 --> 35:13.196
You don't have to point the gun at me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

35:13.362 --> 35:14.530
Damn right you're not.

35:15.656 --> 35:18.367
- My name is Lee.
- I know what your name is.

35:19.202 --> 35:20.203
What's your name?

35:21.204 --> 35:23.539
You're cute. For a doctor.

35:23.998 --> 35:26.167
Thanks! You're cute, for a gangster.

35:31.881 --> 35:34.509
Hi, Selina. Sorry about this, Lee.

35:34.675 --> 35:35.968
Oh, hey. No problem.

35:45.478 --> 35:48.189
So? Is Bridgit okay?

35:49.899 --> 35:53.152
I'm sorry. She's not gonna make it.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.449
You said that you'd help her!

35:58.741 --> 36:00.868
I tried, Selina. I tried.

36:01.077 --> 36:02.787
But she didn't wanna go quietly.

36:05.915 --> 36:07.458
I think she wanted it to end this way.

36:17.134 --> 36:19.303
Look, Selina--

36:19.470 --> 36:21.264
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

36:22.598 --> 36:24.684
I know you were
telling the truth about Bridgit.

36:26.769 --> 36:31.190
That her brothers put her up to this.
I need to know who hired them.

36:31.566 --> 36:34.318
I already told you I don't know.

36:34.485 --> 36:35.570
And I still don't believe you.

36:35.736 --> 36:38.281
What do you care?
You don't care about people like us.

36:38.447 --> 36:40.658
It's not like you're really gonna
go after your little friend.

36:41.158 --> 36:42.243
My friend?

36:45.872 --> 36:46.873
Do you mean Penguin?

36:50.042 --> 36:52.837
Why would he set those fires?
That doesn't make any sense.

36:53.004 --> 36:55.131
Ask him yourself.

36:57.466 --> 36:59.802
I'm done talking to you.

37:03.264 --> 37:06.642
I should have never trusted a cop.

37:08.352 --> 37:10.187
I tried to help her.
It just went a different way.

37:10.354 --> 37:12.481
Is that what you call it
when someone dies?

37:14.817 --> 37:16.277
Is that what you tell yourself?

37:17.570 --> 37:18.738
I'm sorry.

37:22.992 --> 37:24.160
Whatever.

37:47.391 --> 37:48.851
You're so sweet.

37:49.602 --> 37:51.228
Kristen, what's the matter?

37:52.563 --> 37:53.564
Um...

37:53.814 --> 37:55.024
I'm scared.

37:55.483 --> 37:56.609
Of what?

37:56.984 --> 37:58.194
Of Tom Dougherty.

37:59.195 --> 38:05.076
He used to tell me, if he ever saw me
with another man, he would kill me.

38:06.243 --> 38:09.580
I'm terrified of what will happen
when he comes back.

38:09.747 --> 38:11.707
- You don't need to worry about that.
- Mmm.

38:12.625 --> 38:15.378
You don't know him. He is a monster.

38:15.544 --> 38:19.423
Listen to me. You do not need
to worry about Tom Dougherty.

38:21.133 --> 38:23.386
You are sweet. But...

38:23.970 --> 38:26.389
You're not a fighter.
You couldn't possibly take him on.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.559
Trust me, he's been taken care of.

38:32.103 --> 38:33.229
What does that mean?

38:35.231 --> 38:36.232
Um...

38:38.401 --> 38:40.569
Some time ago,
he and I had an altercation.

38:40.987 --> 38:42.613
I asked him
to treat you with more respect.

38:43.072 --> 38:44.073
Oh, my God.

38:44.240 --> 38:46.701
And he said he would treat you
any way he liked, and he assaulted me.

38:46.993 --> 38:48.035
Oh, my God!

38:48.202 --> 38:49.829
So, anyhow, long story short...

38:54.125 --> 38:55.209
I killed him.

38:57.294 --> 39:00.715
Oh, Ed. That's...
You had me going for a minute, there.

39:00.881 --> 39:03.467
It was outside of your apartment,
under the elevated train.

39:03.718 --> 39:04.969
I stabbed him and he died.

39:05.219 --> 39:06.262
Ed, that's not funny.

39:06.429 --> 39:07.680
I'm not being funny.

39:25.740 --> 39:26.949
"T. Dougherty."

39:27.450 --> 39:29.035
Do you believe me now?

39:31.287 --> 39:32.496
Oh, my God.

39:35.791 --> 39:38.669
What's wrong? Where are you going?

39:38.836 --> 39:41.005
- Ah... How could you?
- No, please, sit down.

39:41.172 --> 39:42.423
Don't touch me!

39:43.174 --> 39:44.383
Would you please let me explain?

39:44.592 --> 39:47.136
There is nothing to explain.
I don't even know who you are.

39:47.303 --> 39:49.138
No, that's wrong. You are a murderer.

39:49.430 --> 39:53.142
He was a monster!
You said so. He was abusing you!

39:53.309 --> 39:56.145
I can't believe I even fell for you,
you sicko!

39:56.312 --> 39:59.482
I'm not sick! I love you.
I did it for you.

39:59.648 --> 40:03.360
Everything I ever thought about you, I was
right! I should have my head examined!

40:03.527 --> 40:04.695
Don't say that.

40:04.862 --> 40:06.655
Wait, what were you doing
outside my house?

40:06.989 --> 40:08.074
I was worried for you.

40:08.365 --> 40:10.659
You were stalking me!
You are a psychopath!

40:10.826 --> 40:14.413
That is not true! That's not who I am.
Don't say that about me.

40:14.580 --> 40:17.833
You are going to prison where
they will do horrible things to you.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.001
Things that you deserve.

40:19.168 --> 40:20.628
Don't say that to me!

40:21.587 --> 40:23.089
No, let go! Don't touch me!

40:25.841 --> 40:27.134
Let go of me, you freak!

40:27.301 --> 40:28.344
Please don't call me that!

40:29.011 --> 40:30.012
Ow!

40:31.222 --> 40:32.431
Help!

40:33.182 --> 40:37.061
Listen to me!
I am not the man that you think I am.

40:37.353 --> 40:39.188
I would never do anything to hurt you.

40:40.189 --> 40:43.442
I had to kill him. Because he hit you.
Do you understand that?

40:43.943 --> 40:46.278
I did it for you.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.697
I promise I will never do anything
to hurt you ever again.

40:49.698 --> 40:53.911
I love you. I've loved you since
the first moment that I saw you.

40:58.749 --> 41:03.546
Kristen. Kristen? Oh, no, no, no, don't.

41:04.713 --> 41:05.714
Oh, no.

41:07.508 --> 41:08.551
Oh, no.

41:09.718 --> 41:12.096
No, no, no, no, no!

41:12.763 --> 41:14.849
Please! Please, no!

41:16.142 --> 41:18.185
No! No!

41:22.231 --> 41:23.357
No!

42:05.858 --> 42:07.318
No!

42:16.577 --> 42:18.120
<i>Damn, this girl looks rough.</i>

42:19.205 --> 42:21.957
They tell people she dead,
but that's a lie.

42:22.750 --> 42:24.835
I heard the suit she was wearing
melted to her.

42:25.127 --> 42:27.296
- They say she's fireproof.
- Come on.

42:27.463 --> 42:29.131
Yeah, man. Fireproof.

42:29.798 --> 42:33.886
That's why they sent her down here with
the rest of the monsters. For testing.

44:01.724 --> 44:02.725
