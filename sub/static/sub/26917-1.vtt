she thought the best way for me

to meet my classmates
would be to sign me up

26:25.451 --> 26:27.151

26:28.254 --> 26:30.754

Your sister.

She had on this bright
yellow dress.

26:49.976 --> 26:53.611
And a little crown
of stars.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.379
She marched right
over to me,

26:55.414 --> 26:58.349

was gonna be her friend.

26:58.451 --> 27:01.051

the rest of the day.

Mitch's mom first got sick,

01:11:43.233 --> 01:11:46.634

how scared she was.

she came to the clinic.

01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:02.216

and you told her

01:12:02.252 --> 01:12:06.821
that you would help
her through it.
