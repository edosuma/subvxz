Seriously, I want to have
sex with your show.

00:16.500 --> 00:20.041
(LAUGHING)
I'm telling you, an American
version would be huge.

00:20.041 --> 00:22.250

Eh, well, we already have
Julian committed to
recreate the role of Lyman.

Julian is the show.

00:29.166 --> 00:32.667
Merc may not have
actually seen your show.

00:32.667 --> 00:34.041
Has he seen it?
No.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.375
There is an actor available.

00:37.375 --> 00:40.500
Huge star.
He would be perfect
for this.

00:40.834 --> 00:42.166
Really? Who?

00:42.500 --> 00:44.166
Matt LeBlanc.

00:45.959 --> 00:48.750
And so what?
You want me for the old
fat guy's part? Thanks.

00:49.041 --> 00:51.542
We don't want you.
Again, thanks.

00:51.917 --> 00:54.542
Matt's been telling me
about the changes
for his character.

00:54.542 --> 00:57.250
I love that he's a coach.

I hate this show?

I believe it's come up.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.208
You're much more
attractive than she is.
You are.

01:03.667 --> 01:05.125
She's all plastic.

01:05.375 --> 01:06.709

01:07.834 --> 01:08.959
Yuck.

I get to work
with you.

what this is about.

interest in her at all.

on the wrong side!

01:23.041 --> 01:25.250

started it.

01:34.750 --> 01:37.166
She was driving
on the wrong side

No!

I swear, the thought
that I was with him
physically disgusts me.

I'm actually nauseated.
It makes me want to vomit.
All right.

01:53.417 --> 01:55.875
Not to get
too melodramatic,
but I think...

01:57.000 --> 01:58.417
You've broken my heart.

it's just a mid-life crisis.

he had the affair with

03:23.000 --> 03:26.291

it's way over the top

desperate and needy.

07:43.750 --> 07:44.625

or may not still like me.

you might come off
as kind of pathetic,

08:07.000 --> 08:10.250
on a deeper level,
by being able to judge you,

08:10.250 --> 08:12.792
it allows him
to feel empowered,

11:11.959 --> 11:13.875
(MOUTHING)
I chose the ring.

11:15.083 --> 11:16.291
Oh!

11:16.959 --> 11:18.291
JAMIE: Here you go.

11:18.291 --> 11:19.750
Yum!

11:19.750 --> 11:22.750
So, I saw your name
in the paper today.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.542
For that big
Save the Bees thing?

11:24.542 --> 11:26.083
Oh, it's so important.

11:26.083 --> 11:28.166
In the last five years,
the worldwide...
(MOUTHING) Wow!

11:28.166 --> 11:30.959
...honeybee population
has just been decimated.
You look so hot.

11:30.959 --> 11:32.625
And people don't realize
how essential they are

11:32.625 --> 11:35.250
for pollinating our
fruits and vegetables.

11:35.250 --> 11:38.333
And now 50%
of the hives are gone.
(MOUTHING) I want to fuck you.

11:38.333 --> 11:40.500
It's called "colony
collapse disorder."

11:40.500 --> 11:41.959
(SOFTLY) Stop it!

11:42.458 --> 11:44.792
Well, hopefully we can.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.166
Yes.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.291
MATT: Hey!

11:49.542 --> 11:51.375
Our star has arrived.

11:51.375 --> 11:53.166
Hello, Matt. Popcorn?

11:53.166 --> 11:54.917
Sure. And by the way,

11:54.917 --> 11:58.208
thanks so much, you guys,
for doing this. Very cool.

11:58.208 --> 12:00.875
Are you kidding?
How could I not? Come on!

12:00.875 --> 12:02.834
Matt LeBlanc's
first show since  Friends?

12:04.500 --> 12:05.625
Okay.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.583
Hey, come and see
my new set-up.

12:10.333 --> 12:13.208
Just so you know,
this is huge.

12:13.208 --> 12:15.750
He's never
screened a show
at his house before.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.834
That's how much
he believes in this.

12:17.834 --> 12:20.917
Maybe we should all lower
our expectations a bit.

12:20.917 --> 12:23.834
I mean, have you
read the reviews?

12:24.375 --> 12:25.875
(CHUCKLING) Oh, please!

12:25.875 --> 12:28.667
No one cares
about TV reviews.

12:28.667 --> 12:31.417
They hated
most of the crap
we've got on the air

12:31.417 --> 12:32.375
and people still watch it.

12:32.375 --> 12:34.208
Oh, to be that crap.

12:35.834 --> 12:37.709
Curtain going up.
Grab a seat.

12:37.709 --> 12:39.667
ANNOUNCER:
Sometimes you score

12:39.667 --> 12:43.083
and sometimes
life just
Pucks!

12:43.834 --> 12:48.333
Matt LeBlanc returns
in the hilarious
premiere of
Pucks!

12:48.625 --> 12:49.750
Next.
(ALL CHEERING)

12:54.834 --> 12:57.625
(ALL CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

12:58.041 --> 12:59.458
I need a book.

12:59.917 --> 13:01.417
Can you be
less specific?

13:01.417 --> 13:03.125
(PEOPLE CHUCKLING)

13:03.125 --> 13:06.333
I don't know, I'm looking
for something with pages.

13:06.333 --> 13:07.583
Okay, fine,
I don't need a book.

13:07.583 --> 13:09.083
(SCATTERED CHUCKLING)

13:09.083 --> 13:10.917
LYMAN:  Hey, I read books.

13:10.917 --> 13:13.625
NICOLA:  You do realize
that the swimsuit issue
of a sports magazine

13:13.625 --> 13:15.291
doesn't count as a book?

13:15.291 --> 13:18.041
Oh, so now
you get to decide
what's a book?

13:18.041 --> 13:20.917
Anyway, I called you.

13:20.917 --> 13:22.000
I know.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.375
I left you three messages.

13:23.375 --> 13:24.792
NICOLA:  Four.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.041
LYMAN:  Really?

13:27.041 --> 13:28.083
Four?

13:28.083 --> 13:30.166
Yeah, and I didn't call
you back four times.

13:30.166 --> 13:31.750
We're even.

13:32.709 --> 13:34.917
LYMAN:  You're so mean.
It's Matt.

13:34.917 --> 13:37.041
NICOLA:  No, just trying
to be clear.
I know.

13:37.041 --> 13:39.333
I told you,
I'm not going out
with a guy whose life

13:39.333 --> 13:40.792
centers around
a hockey puck.
Hmm.

13:40.792 --> 13:42.458
Well, maybe if you spent
a little time with me,

13:42.458 --> 13:45.125
you'd see there's more
to me than just my puck.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.709
Come on,
go out with me once.

13:46.709 --> 13:48.709
I promise, my puck
won't even come up.

13:48.709 --> 13:50.000
Really?
Because it seems like

13:50.000 --> 13:52.083
it's probably a puck
that comes up a lot.

13:52.083 --> 13:54.750
I'm telling you,
there's a lot more to me
than just my puck.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.083
And yet, at
the end of the day,

13:56.083 --> 13:58.959
I think your puck
is pretty much
what you're all about.

14:00.875 --> 14:03.208
KYLE:  You do realize that
if I die right now,

14:03.208 --> 14:05.834
this is the
last conversation
I'll ever hear.

14:06.959 --> 14:09.208
(LAUGHING) Oh, yeah!

14:13.291 --> 14:14.959
(CHEERING)

14:16.834 --> 14:18.458
How great was that?

14:18.458 --> 14:19.792
Really great!

14:19.792 --> 14:21.458
Seriously, I'm ready
to watch it again.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.750
Have I mentioned
how much I love this show?

that sounds good.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.583
Oh, you've got
some butter
on your pants.

14:31.583 --> 14:33.500
What? Oh, shit!

14:34.458 --> 14:36.291
Yup, that's butter.

14:36.291 --> 14:38.250
Where's bread
when you need it?

14:38.250 --> 14:41.000
(CHUCKLES UNCOMFORTABLY)
Okay. Okay.

14:47.917 --> 14:49.417
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

14:50.041 --> 14:51.500
Hey. Hey, hey.

14:54.166 --> 14:56.083
Listen, I know
you're still pissed
at me and everything,

14:56.083 --> 14:58.709
but you will not believe
what just happened.

14:58.709 --> 15:00.291
I'm not "still pissed."

15:00.291 --> 15:01.667
No?
No.

15:02.041 --> 15:04.750
Because that implies
there'll come a time
when I'm not pissed.

15:04.750 --> 15:06.709
I will always be pissed.

15:07.792 --> 15:09.834
With you,
I'm in a constant state

15:09.834 --> 15:11.625
of pissed.
Yeah, yeah, okay, but...

15:11.625 --> 15:13.500
No. No "but."
But...

15:13.500 --> 15:16.125
(FIRMLY) No! No "but."

15:16.125 --> 15:19.291
Whatever you've got to say,
I don't want to hear it.

15:20.583 --> 15:21.792
I'm not your friend.

15:23.083 --> 15:25.208
You want to talk
about the show, fine.

15:25.208 --> 15:27.917
But anything
beyond work...
Anything...

15:30.291 --> 15:32.375
Well, this is
kind of work-related.

15:32.375 --> 15:33.959
Is it?

15:36.667 --> 15:40.041
I was watching the show
when it happened?

15:44.375 --> 15:45.792
(GROANING)

MATT: Unbelievable,
unbelievable.

what I ever expected.

Are you all right?

16:09.625 --> 16:11.875
No, I'm fine.
That'll teach me
to walk into a room.

16:11.875 --> 16:14.750
Sorry, everyone's
just very excited
about the ratings.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.542
Really? We did well?

16:16.542 --> 16:18.750
We got a 5.6 with a 13 share

16:18.750 --> 16:21.500
and a 3.8
in the 18-to-34 demo.

16:21.875 --> 16:24.959
Wow! I have no idea
what this boy just said.

16:25.208 --> 16:26.792
They're good.
Are you serious?

16:26.792 --> 16:28.792
Really good.
MATT: Yeah.

16:28.792 --> 16:30.959

16:30.959 --> 16:33.125

who this show is for."

It's for everyone
but you, cock-face!

you didn't read them.

So congratulations, everyone.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.417

16:43.834 --> 16:45.250
How about that?
Mmm-hmm.

16:46.166 --> 16:49.291

let us go home early?

We're "they."

I mean...

17:43.750 --> 17:45.250
I know, it's insane.

17:45.250 --> 17:47.291
Do you realize more people
saw our show last night

17:47.291 --> 17:50.375
than probably every episode
of  Lyman's Boys
put together.

17:50.375 --> 17:51.709
Seriously?
Yeah.

17:51.709 --> 17:54.542
You've got to say
this about Americans,
there's a lot of them.

17:59.417 --> 18:00.875
What are you doing?

18:00.875 --> 18:04.041
I marked one two days ago.
I just want to see
how long it sits here.

18:07.208 --> 18:08.875
So, disappointed?

18:09.500 --> 18:10.750
At what?

18:10.750 --> 18:13.875
I can't imagine
a big hit was what
you were wishing for.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.375
It's not true.
Right!

18:15.792 --> 18:16.875
It's not.

18:17.667 --> 18:19.709
(GASPING) It's still here!

18:21.625 --> 18:23.041
You're telling me
there wasn't a part of you

18:23.041 --> 18:25.250
that was hoping
this whole thing would bomb
and we could go home?

18:25.250 --> 18:26.291
How wrong you are.

18:29.125 --> 18:30.750
Look, you have
made it very clear

18:30.750 --> 18:33.083
that when we get home,
we're finished,
we're nothing.

18:33.083 --> 18:36.125
Right now, at least
we have this.

18:36.125 --> 18:38.542
Why would I wish
for that to go away?

19:02.583 --> 19:04.667
Hey.
Can I ask you something?

19:04.667 --> 19:06.583
Could you give us a sec?

19:06.583 --> 19:07.750
What's up?
In this scene,

19:08.417 --> 19:10.125
I know the guys are
lying to me, right?

19:10.125 --> 19:12.500
Right. But you don't want
to give too much away

19:12.500 --> 19:14.291
so you can
surprise them later.

19:14.291 --> 19:17.083
That's what I thought.
Oh, and also...

19:17.458 --> 19:20.250
Jamie Lapidus gave me
a hand-job during
the show last night.

19:22.709 --> 19:23.709
I had to tell you.

19:24.125 --> 19:25.875
Oh, yeah, who better
to share the news with

19:25.875 --> 19:27.125
you had sex with
someone else's wife.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.291
Well, first of all,
just a hand-job.

19:29.291 --> 19:32.000
With her husband
three seats away!
I know!

19:32.000 --> 19:33.125
My God, you're
proud of this?

19:33.125 --> 19:35.000
No. But I gotta say,

19:35.333 --> 19:38.000
getting jerked-off
while you're watching
yourself on TV...

19:38.000 --> 19:39.625
Actors work their
whole lives for that.

19:49.709 --> 19:51.083
SEAN: Who else
knows about this?
MATT: Nobody.

19:51.083 --> 19:52.583
Good. Keep it that way.

19:52.583 --> 19:55.208
The last thing our
little show needs is for
Merc Lapidus to find out

19:55.208 --> 19:56.709
that you are
fucking his wife.

19:56.709 --> 19:58.000
Again, not fucking...

19:58.000 --> 20:00.959
I'm not sure
he'll appreciate
the bloody distinction!

20:00.959 --> 20:02.166
What's the matter with you?

20:02.166 --> 20:04.500
That woman is
married to your boss!

20:04.500 --> 20:05.667
And while we're
on the subject,

20:05.667 --> 20:07.500
what is it with you
and other people's wives?

20:07.500 --> 20:08.792
It's pathological!

20:09.375 --> 20:11.125
Are there no other
women in the world

20:11.125 --> 20:13.208
who aren't the spouses
of people you know?

20:13.208 --> 20:14.333
It's...

20:14.709 --> 20:15.875
What?

20:16.875 --> 20:17.834
I've missed this.

20:20.500 --> 20:21.667
(SIGHING)

20:27.000 --> 20:29.250
BEVERLY: Mmm. This one.
Better than this one.

20:29.250 --> 20:30.583
MATT: Hey.

20:30.875 --> 20:32.709
You know that
cool Prada jacket

20:32.709 --> 20:35.583
that you said my character
would never wear?
Mmm-hmm.

20:35.583 --> 20:36.667
I figured out
where it would work.

20:36.917 --> 20:38.458
Where?
My house.

20:38.792 --> 20:41.583
Annie, could you
grab that for me?
Okay.

20:43.375 --> 20:46.792
Well, good, because
who's more deserving
of free clothes than you?

20:46.792 --> 20:48.667
You can take stuff.
What do you want?

20:48.667 --> 20:52.333
Or I could go to a shop,
like a normal person.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.417
Yeah, someone who
turns down free shit,

20:56.083 --> 20:57.792
not a normal person.

21:02.417 --> 21:06.000
So, listen, this thing
with Sean being pissed off.

21:06.375 --> 21:08.542
Yeah?
How long do you think
that's gonna last?

21:09.500 --> 21:12.625
It's just weird
not being able to talk
to him about stuff.

21:13.250 --> 21:16.375
Yes, this must be
very hard for you.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.583
It is!

21:17.917 --> 21:19.250
Ah, that's great, thanks.

21:20.417 --> 21:21.458
Uh...

21:22.041 --> 21:23.625
There was a hat.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.291
Sure.

21:27.208 --> 21:29.417
Look, I'm not saying
he doesn't have
a right to be mad.

21:29.417 --> 21:33.250
I get it, but at what
point is it, like,
"All right already"?

21:33.250 --> 21:34.625
"All right already"?

21:34.625 --> 21:36.542
You know what I mean.

21:36.542 --> 21:39.333
He swears he'll
never get over it,
but I just...

21:39.333 --> 21:42.375
I have to believe
it's not true.
I just... I have to.

21:42.375 --> 21:43.959
Yeah. I hear you.

21:44.875 --> 21:48.208
I certainly can't blame him.
When I look back
at what I did,

21:48.208 --> 21:50.041
it's like I'm looking at
this whole other person

21:50.041 --> 21:54.125
doing these inexplicable
things with the absolutely
last person on God's earth

21:54.125 --> 21:56.417
I'd ever want
to do them with.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.750
You're welcome.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.458
And now here we are,

22:00.458 --> 22:04.917
and I may have lost
the only thing I ever
actually cared about.

22:06.709 --> 22:09.458
Well, if there's
anything I can do...

22:10.500 --> 22:13.333
You could stop wearing
that fucking cologne!

22:22.041 --> 22:23.166
How we doing on the hat?

22:24.000 --> 22:27.792
Hey, did you guys see this?
Our ratings went up
in the nationals.

22:28.250 --> 22:29.375
Wow!

22:29.375 --> 22:31.542
Do you have any idea
what you're looking at?

22:31.542 --> 22:32.917
No.

22:32.917 --> 22:35.291
I can't believe
I came this close
to not taking this show.

22:35.291 --> 22:36.625
Really?
Yeah.

22:36.625 --> 22:38.000
I got two offers this year.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.083
This one, and they
wanted me for the kid
on that talking dog show.

22:40.083 --> 22:42.333
There's a talking dog show?
JASON: Over at ABC.

22:42.333 --> 22:44.542
It starts next week.
Actually, it's opposite us.

22:44.542 --> 22:47.166
Any good?
Dude, it's a
talking dog show.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.500
Yeah, dude.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.583
So like, I wasn't sure
which one to pick.

22:50.583 --> 22:52.542
My wife was
really pushing me
to take the other one.

22:52.542 --> 22:54.083
(STAMMERING) Your wife?

22:54.083 --> 22:56.291
Well, not officially yet.

22:56.625 --> 22:57.917
We have to wait
till my divorce
comes through.

22:59.875 --> 23:01.333
This would be
your second marriage?

23:01.333 --> 23:04.041
Technically.
I don't even count
the first one.

23:04.041 --> 23:06.000
It was just
a big fucking mess.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.291
(CLEARING THROAT)

23:07.291 --> 23:09.041
We got married
really young.

23:09.041 --> 23:10.542
I assume as embryos.

23:10.542 --> 23:11.709
I'm 27.

23:11.709 --> 23:13.583
You're not!
Kevin's 29.

23:13.583 --> 23:14.959
Stoke's gonna be 31.

23:14.959 --> 23:16.542
Very strange high school
we're running!

23:16.542 --> 23:19.583
Hey, the kids on  Glee
are like, in their 50s.

23:19.583 --> 23:21.458
Excuse me.
Are we close to shooting?

23:21.458 --> 23:24.542
Yeah, but they
need you guys over
in the locker room set.

23:27.375 --> 23:29.417
(WHINING VOICE)
Oh, I've got to walk!

23:29.875 --> 23:31.208
That's awful.

23:31.625 --> 23:34.834
(ALL SINGING)
â™ª Happy birthday to you

23:34.834 --> 23:37.250
â™ª Happy birthday to you

23:37.250 --> 23:40.250
â™ª Happy birthday, dear Sean

23:40.250 --> 23:42.458
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

23:45.375 --> 23:46.500
Did you do this?

23:46.500 --> 23:48.375
Actually, no.
It's from Matt.

23:48.375 --> 23:49.625
Ah.

23:51.166 --> 23:52.458
SEAN: Okay.

23:52.458 --> 23:53.542
(BLOWING)

23:56.500 --> 23:57.709
(ALL CHEERING)

24:01.417 --> 24:03.417
Congratulations.
Thank you.

24:04.166 --> 24:06.000
Happy birthday.
Oh, wow!

24:06.250 --> 24:08.083
Ah.
Congratulations.

24:08.583 --> 24:10.041
(MOUTHING) Happy birthday.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.458
(MOUTHING) Thank you.

24:12.959 --> 24:14.417
SEAN: Hey!
Hey, birthday boy.

24:14.417 --> 24:16.875
All right, man.
Nice one. Right, come on!

24:18.792 --> 24:21.083
(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
Whoo-hoo!

24:23.500 --> 24:25.792
(PHONE RINGING)
WENDY: Sean
and Beverly's office.

24:26.917 --> 24:28.458
Carol Rance on two!

24:29.959 --> 24:31.250
Thank you.

24:32.792 --> 24:35.458
Hi, Carol.
MALE VOICE:
Hold for Carol, please.

24:35.917 --> 24:38.333
Wendy, could you
come here, please?

24:39.417 --> 24:41.250
Yeah?
Would it be possible,

24:41.583 --> 24:43.667
when the person's not
actually on the line,

24:43.667 --> 24:45.458
you could alert me
to that fact
so that I don't...

24:45.458 --> 24:47.583
CAROL:  Hi, you!
There she is.

24:49.417 --> 24:51.041
Hi, Carol. What's up?

24:51.041 --> 24:52.917
I'm taking you out
for Sean's birthday.

24:52.917 --> 24:54.208
You should not be alone.

24:54.208 --> 24:55.291
Aw!

24:55.291 --> 24:56.959
That's sweet.

24:57.375 --> 24:58.458
Merc cancel again?

25:00.125 --> 25:03.667
(SIGHING) He forgot
he had a thing
at his kid's school.

25:03.667 --> 25:05.834
Sometimes I wonder why
I even shave my legs.

25:05.834 --> 25:07.083
(GIGGLING)

25:07.083 --> 25:08.875
So, how did Sean
like the watch?

25:08.875 --> 25:11.417
I didn't wanna
put him on the spot
when I gave it to him.

25:11.417 --> 25:14.834
So I had a PA
put it in his car.

25:15.083 --> 25:16.166
(CAROL CLUCKING)

25:16.166 --> 25:17.667
Yeah, so what?

25:18.291 --> 25:21.291
(CONTINUES CLUCKING)

25:21.291 --> 25:22.458
(DISCONNECTS TELEPHONE)

25:34.000 --> 25:35.375
Hey!
Hey!

25:35.375 --> 25:37.709
Look at you.
Very impressive.

25:37.709 --> 25:40.500
Please. I had
two pieces of your
fucking birthday cake!

25:40.500 --> 25:42.417
I need to run
to like, Cleveland.

25:42.417 --> 25:43.667
Say what you want
about bulimia...

25:43.667 --> 25:45.375
Please don't finish
that sentence.

25:45.875 --> 25:48.542
I promise, once we're sure
we're not getting canceled,

25:48.542 --> 25:50.375
I'll start
packing on the pounds.
Till then...

25:51.542 --> 25:53.625
I think we're doing
a little better than
"Not getting canceled."

25:53.625 --> 25:55.083
You saw those
numbers today.

25:55.083 --> 25:56.709
No, I know. Still...

25:56.709 --> 25:57.709
What?

25:57.709 --> 25:59.375
The ratings were...
No, they were great,

25:59.375 --> 26:01.250
but that's just
people sampling it.

26:01.250 --> 26:03.000
Let's wait till
next week and see.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.542
Well you're a big
ball of positivity.

26:04.542 --> 26:08.375
Hey, I once did this
Fox show about these
three girls living together.

26:08.375 --> 26:09.875
I was the one with
the smaller tits.

26:10.250 --> 26:11.834
Interesting concept.
Yeah.

26:11.834 --> 26:15.583
We had the highest
number of any new series
premiering that season.

26:15.583 --> 26:18.041
Week two, not so much.

26:18.041 --> 26:19.375
Week three, ugh!

26:19.375 --> 26:21.375
They kept dropping
and dropping.

26:21.375 --> 26:24.125
They pulled
the plug after six.
Wow!

26:24.125 --> 26:27.834
Now I won't even decorate my
dressing room until we're
picked up for the back nine.

26:27.834 --> 26:31.041
Just because you
start off strong,
doesn't mean that...

26:31.041 --> 26:31.959
What?

26:32.667 --> 26:34.542
What are you doing?
I'm just saying.

26:35.208 --> 26:36.458
It's my birthday.

26:37.333 --> 26:39.417
Oh, shit!
I am an asshole!

26:39.750 --> 26:42.250
It's all good.
The ratings will
never come down.

26:42.250 --> 26:44.417
(CHUCKLES) I thought
you were a better
actress than that.

26:44.417 --> 26:47.125
Obviously you haven't
read my reviews
for this show.

26:48.709 --> 26:50.417
So what are you doing
for the birthday?

26:50.417 --> 26:51.792
Oh, birthdays
are no big deal.

26:52.250 --> 26:53.333
So, nothing.

26:53.333 --> 26:55.792
I'm fine, I've got some
scripts to look over and...

26:55.792 --> 26:57.583
Fuck that!
We're gonna celebrate.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.208
Well, I appreciate it,
but I really...

27:04.709 --> 27:05.792
And that was?

27:06.125 --> 27:07.583
Birthday present?

27:08.583 --> 27:11.333
Well, as gifts go,
it was very thoughtful.

27:11.709 --> 27:13.750
It also comes in large.

27:24.625 --> 27:28.125
I don't know why
I feel obliged to ask this,
but your boyfriend?

27:28.834 --> 27:31.375
What boyfriend?
You told me
you had a boyfriend.

27:31.375 --> 27:33.750
Oh, maybe I am
a good actress.
