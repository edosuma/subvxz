And there is John Booth.

00:07.563 --> 00:08.962
The guy that just bought our network?

00:08.997 --> 00:10.405
Everyone here knows

00:10.406 --> 00:12.065
that you're the true
creator of "Everlasting."

00:12.101 --> 00:13.267
You're a legend.

00:13.302 --> 00:14.462
You want to come home with me?

00:14.470 --> 00:17.104
My dad died.

00:17.139 --> 00:18.472
Funeral's tomorrow.

00:18.507 --> 00:20.207

season's suitor, Darius Beck!

00:22.945 --> 00:24.577
Madison: Beth Ann's on the move.

00:24.613 --> 00:26.880
If you really want to go
home, there is one thing

00:26.915 --> 00:28.749
pretty much every guy does not want

00:28.784 --> 00:30.383
their potential wife to do.

00:30.418 --> 00:32.786
Tiffany: Yeah, what's
that... screw their friends?

00:32.821 --> 00:34.955
Ruby, do you have plans this evening?

00:34.990 --> 00:37.355
Where is Ruby? I want to
see my daughter right now.

00:37.356 --> 00:38.424
Please.

00:38.460 --> 00:39.287
- Ruby!
- Dad?!

00:39.312 --> 00:40.560
What the hell?

00:40.595 --> 00:43.596
You can be everything my
father says that you're not.

00:43.632 --> 00:45.131
It's gonna be too much work

00:45.166 --> 00:47.767
disappointing you every day, Ruby.

00:47.802 --> 00:50.436
You're a selfish, manipulative bitch.

00:50.472 --> 00:52.905
You want to demote me? You
demote me to my face.

Oh.

Okay, thanks.

01:27.474 --> 01:28.940
Jeremy can't get away with this.

01:28.975 --> 01:30.975
He didn't. I fired him.

Okay, well, I'm gonna go to the police.

ever report anything around here,

01:34.915 --> 01:36.714

be another silent woman,

01:56.669 --> 01:58.202
Did you see what he did to me?

thought I was gonna kill him.

- To pitch you.

that okay for an act break?

fine, but don't think, okay?

06:49.352 --> 06:51.452

06:51.488 --> 06:53.354
Mm. Well, then why did you tell Graham

06:53.389 --> 06:55.857
- you hadn't decided yet?
- 'Cause I hadn't.

be going to Alabama?

Chicken and Watermelon?

07:09.539 --> 07:10.971
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.

07:11.007 --> 07:12.840
I think so. Can I be honest
with you for a second?

07:12.875 --> 07:14.024
I don't know. Can you?

07:14.025 --> 07:15.943

harsh, what you did to Ruby.

07:15.978 --> 07:17.310
Whoa. What I did?

07:17.346 --> 07:18.646
I'm just saying that
the fans now see her

07:18.681 --> 07:20.114
as this victim, all right?

like a good guy again,

07:21.483 --> 07:22.983

terrorize you than Beth Ann.

anywhere with Beth Ann.

07:30.926 --> 07:32.492

07:32.528 --> 07:34.194

in harsh and realistic.

You want to be
realistic, I'll be realistic.

07:36.165 --> 07:37.631

I want you to run my plays!

plays, then you suck at it.

run me into an epidural,

do it every stupid day

your career, you know what?

- You have a wonderful way about you.
- [Chuckling] Oh, well...

17:23.851 --> 17:26.318
What is happening in here?

17:26.353 --> 17:27.952
The show's in Alabama today, people.

17:27.987 --> 17:29.654
Yeah, well, Rachel
stole one of my girls.

17:29.690 --> 17:32.123
As producers, we
decided why waste a day.

17:32.158 --> 17:33.491
So, we came up with a new segment

17:33.527 --> 17:35.007
using the girls who were left behind.

17:35.028 --> 17:37.028
Mm. Look at you, going all rogue.

17:37.063 --> 17:39.096
Go. Carry on.

17:39.132 --> 17:42.533
So, my situation here is
a little less containable

17:42.568 --> 17:44.101
- than I thought.
- Right.

17:44.137 --> 17:45.536
Are we talking a couple of hours, or...?

17:45.571 --> 17:47.238
Um, listen.

17:49.175 --> 17:52.109
You're great, and I
love spending time with you,

17:52.145 --> 17:57.381
but I have a real issue
here, and you need to, uh...

17:57.416 --> 17:59.182
Leave. I get it.

17:59.218 --> 18:00.818
I'm sorry. I just...

18:00.853 --> 18:02.353
No, it's okay. Don't be silly.

18:02.388 --> 18:03.465
Look, I've been playing hooky.

18:03.466 --> 18:05.823
I should probably make an appearance
at the office anyway.

18:05.858 --> 18:07.591
- Call me when you're ready.
- Okay.

18:11.597 --> 18:14.197
- Quinn...
- Shut up.

18:14.233 --> 18:16.299
Chet: You know, I got to
be honest with you. [Sighs]

18:16.335 --> 18:17.868
He is one beautiful woman.

18:17.903 --> 18:20.136
I get it... the whole
diversified genius thing.

18:20.172 --> 18:21.371
I-I could be that guy.

18:21.406 --> 18:23.039
- No, you can't, Chet.
- I can...

18:23.075 --> 18:24.435
If you could have, you would have.

18:24.442 --> 18:26.809
- I am going to be that guy.
- Okay.

18:26.845 --> 18:28.544
I'm gonna prove it to
you. I'm gonna be that guy.

18:28.580 --> 18:33.148
I'd like to introduce Dr. Wagerstein's
"Mirror of Truth."

18:33.184 --> 18:35.351
What, is she like
trademarking? I came up with it.

18:35.387 --> 18:37.052
Whatever. We'll cut that part out.

18:37.088 --> 18:38.755
All of you will take a long, hard look

18:38.790 --> 18:41.691
into the Mirror of Truth
and tell us why you think

18:41.726 --> 18:44.694
Darius didn't take you home?

18:44.729 --> 18:48.497
Yael, are you ready to gaze
into the Mirror of Truth?

18:48.532 --> 18:51.566
See what little Miss Perfect has to say.

18:51.602 --> 18:54.669
I think Darius didn't take me
home because he's intimidated.

18:54.705 --> 18:56.438
I get that a lot.

18:56.473 --> 18:59.608
You know, because I'm smart,
guys think that I can't, like,

18:59.643 --> 19:01.277
get down on their level or
be cool with their friends.

19:01.312 --> 19:02.400
You want me to go give them more drinks?

19:02.402 --> 19:05.213
- Yeah, ply them with liquor, please.
- She's so snobby.

19:05.248 --> 19:07.081
Or maybe he just thought my
family was gonna be too fancy

19:07.117 --> 19:09.017
or uptight or something.

19:09.052 --> 19:11.185
- As opposed to...?
- As opposed to what?

19:11.221 --> 19:13.855
As opposed to our ghetto-ass families?

19:13.891 --> 19:16.024
<i>- [All talking indistinctly]
- Oh, my God. That is not what I said.</i>

19:16.059 --> 19:18.527
You didn't have to say
it, honey, I heard it.

19:18.562 --> 19:20.094
You just... You're
putting words in her mouth!

19:20.130 --> 19:21.896
All right. Pass me the mirror, sister.

19:21.932 --> 19:22.964
[Sighs]

19:25.969 --> 19:30.871
Okay. I think Darius didn't
take me home because...

19:30.907 --> 19:32.473
he doesn't like cops.

19:32.508 --> 19:34.275
Oh, if we're being honest...

19:34.311 --> 19:36.444
and that's what we're
doing in this little love nest.

19:36.479 --> 19:38.412
If we're being honest, the short hair...

19:38.448 --> 19:39.780
What?

19:39.816 --> 19:41.549
Like, I totally get what
you're going for,

19:41.584 --> 19:43.424
but I really think
that it makes you kind of...

19:43.453 --> 19:45.285
Say it. What about my hair?

19:45.321 --> 19:48.121
It kind of makes you look... like...

19:48.157 --> 19:50.090
You don't have a vagina.

19:50.125 --> 19:51.224
What?!

19:51.260 --> 19:53.460
- [Laughs]
- There it is!

19:53.495 --> 19:56.163
<i>- [All talking indistinctly]</i>
- Hey, you want to produce something?

19:56.198 --> 19:57.831
I mean, like, really produce?

19:57.866 --> 19:59.433
Okay, listen to me.

19:59.468 --> 20:02.135
Wow. You guys, come on.

20:02.171 --> 20:04.838
- Jameson.
- Hey, hey, hey!

20:04.873 --> 20:07.174
I know that must be difficult to hear.

20:07.209 --> 20:09.642
Express what your
feelings are right now.

20:09.678 --> 20:12.579
I feel like these
bitches are wrong, okay?

20:12.614 --> 20:14.914
My hair makes me look strong and fierce.

20:14.950 --> 20:18.651
Every guy wants to stick it into
someone strong and fierce.

20:18.687 --> 20:20.086
- [Laughs]
- Okay, okay.

20:20.121 --> 20:21.521
Gold.

20:21.556 --> 20:23.957
[Rooster crows]

20:23.992 --> 20:25.358
Wasserman.

20:25.393 --> 20:26.758
Hey. Rachel, okay.

20:26.794 --> 20:28.094
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

20:28.129 --> 20:29.328
- Here's what I'm thinking.
- Shh! Shh! Shh!

20:29.364 --> 20:30.844
- So, we get Darius...
- Just listen to...

20:30.865 --> 20:31.964
Wait a minute. Just listen
to me for one second.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.160
I literally have the best news

20:33.167 --> 20:34.500
I've ever had in my entire life.

20:34.535 --> 20:36.268
- Are you ready?
- Yeah? What?

20:36.304 --> 20:37.669
Beth Ann has a future Trump supporter

20:37.705 --> 20:39.138
growing in her uterus right now.

20:39.173 --> 20:40.606
- She's got a what?
- Exactly.

20:40.641 --> 20:42.174
- Wait.
- I'm not even kidding.

20:42.210 --> 20:45.611
She's pregnant, and I
convinced her to tell her parents

20:45.646 --> 20:48.446
and Darius on-camera tonight.

20:48.482 --> 20:49.781
- You're welcome.
- Wow.

20:49.817 --> 20:50.716
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

20:50.751 --> 20:52.217
- Okay.
- That's amazing.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.785
Yeah. I don't understand why
you're not more excited.

20:53.821 --> 20:55.153
Anyways, I have a lot to do,

20:55.188 --> 20:56.788
[Whispering] I'll talk to you later.

20:56.824 --> 20:58.490
Okay.

20:58.526 --> 20:59.857
Bye.

20:59.893 --> 21:02.227
Jay! Jay!

21:02.262 --> 21:03.561
Come with me.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.862
I just want to talk through the process

21:04.898 --> 21:06.797
of what I've got going on here.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.199
So, these are the
things I think I'll need.

21:08.235 --> 21:09.501
- Coleman, I'll be back in a minute.
- Yeah.

21:09.536 --> 21:10.735
Okay, so listen. This is what I need.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.570
What the...?

21:12.605 --> 21:14.906
- [Beeps]
- Hey. Did you miss me?

21:14.941 --> 21:16.741
How is she?

21:16.776 --> 21:18.009
Who?

21:18.044 --> 21:19.710
- Who do you think?
- I don't know.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.345
If you're talking about
Rachel, she's fine.

21:21.380 --> 21:22.713
Why wouldn't she be?

21:22.749 --> 21:24.749
You think she can't
function without you?

21:24.784 --> 21:26.717
Oh, and you think
you're Mr. Inside Track?

21:26.753 --> 21:28.519
She hasn't told you a thing, has she?

21:28.555 --> 21:30.054
About what?

21:30.089 --> 21:31.488
Jeremy!

21:31.524 --> 21:33.323
Okay? He slapped her around last night,

21:33.359 --> 21:35.392
and apparently she's got
bruises up and down her arm,

21:35.428 --> 21:38.062
You keep her on that
set, and she is a time bomb.

21:38.097 --> 21:40.531
I need you to get her home now.

21:40.566 --> 21:42.732
Look, she seems fine to me, Quinn.

21:42.768 --> 21:44.234
I'm looking at her right now.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.937
[Chuckles] Okay, let me guess.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.772
Right now, she's backed into a corner,

21:48.807 --> 21:51.041
chewing on her
fingers like they're Twinkies,

21:51.076 --> 21:53.376
eyes a-blazing, talking as if her words

21:53.411 --> 21:55.045
are gonna save the world.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.180
I'll call you back.

21:57.215 --> 21:58.915
- [Cellphone beeps]
- [Laughs]

21:58.951 --> 22:01.751
Okay, okay. Okay, ladies.

22:01.787 --> 22:03.920
Ladies. Ladies, let's move on.

22:03.956 --> 22:07.056
Tiffany, why don't you go next?

22:07.092 --> 22:09.757
<i>I think Darius didn't pick me</i>

22:09.793 --> 22:11.259
because he's scared of his feelings.

22:11.295 --> 22:13.761
- [Laughs]
- He is.

22:13.797 --> 22:15.630
He has so much pressure and expectation

22:15.665 --> 22:18.233
surrounding him all
the time. It's scary.

22:18.268 --> 22:20.402
Yeah. Keep telling yourself that.

22:20.437 --> 22:23.405
Um, I think he's probably
just scared of all the STDs

22:23.440 --> 22:24.720
that are probably floating around

22:24.741 --> 22:26.240
in that pretty little mouth.

22:26.275 --> 22:27.575
- [All talking indistinctly]
- I don't have any STDs.

22:27.611 --> 22:28.776
What the hell is she talking about?

22:28.812 --> 22:29.978
She's saying that she...

22:30.013 --> 22:31.713
Yeah, I heard, Dan. Thank you.

22:31.748 --> 22:34.548
Maybe he just doesn't want
his cousin's sloppy seconds?

22:34.584 --> 22:36.383
- W-whoa. His cousin?
- You got with Romeo?

22:36.419 --> 22:38.152
- Where did you hear that?
- Does it matter?

22:38.187 --> 22:40.221
Did you just feed that to her?

22:40.256 --> 22:41.755
I saw you go in and whisper.

22:41.790 --> 22:43.790
I was just producing, Jay.

22:43.826 --> 22:45.493
It's okay.

22:45.528 --> 22:47.661
Tiffany, this is a safe space.

22:47.696 --> 22:48.962
Everyone's being open now.

22:48.998 --> 22:50.631
- Yeah, it's so safe.
- Super safe, Tiff.

22:50.666 --> 22:52.065
Let's hear it.

22:52.101 --> 22:54.135
Is it true? Did you hook up with Romeo?

22:56.472 --> 22:57.338
- Yes.
- [All talking indistinctly]

22:57.373 --> 22:58.639
- Ohh!
- [Laughs]

22:58.674 --> 22:59.906
Yes, but it's not what you think.

22:59.942 --> 23:02.342
It's okay! It's 2016!

23:02.377 --> 23:05.345
It's not... It's so not what you think!

23:05.380 --> 23:08.982
Football princess, hey? We
got two sluts in the house.

23:09.018 --> 23:10.150
[Laughs]

23:10.185 --> 23:11.785
<i>I am a police officer!</i>

23:11.820 --> 23:13.353
Perfect.

23:13.388 --> 23:14.820
- [Horse whinnies]
- It's just I can't believe

23:14.856 --> 23:16.523
this whole thing just fell in our laps.

23:16.558 --> 23:16.983
Rach.

23:17.008 --> 23:18.258
We just have so much
to do when we get back.

23:18.293 --> 23:19.825
- Rachel, look, hey.
- I'm, like, so happy for us.

23:19.861 --> 23:21.093
I feel kind of,
like, emotional about it.

23:21.129 --> 23:22.094
Okay, so, I know what happened.

23:22.130 --> 23:23.829
- What? With what?
- With Jeremy.

23:23.865 --> 23:25.431
Quinn just called and told me just now.

23:25.467 --> 23:26.699
She's worried about you.

23:26.734 --> 23:28.934
I am, too.

23:28.970 --> 23:30.703
- I'm totally fine.
- Okay.

23:30.738 --> 23:32.271
I'm totally fine. I don't...

23:32.306 --> 23:34.006
My thing is I want to get
to the airport right now.

23:34.042 --> 23:36.008
We got to get back,
and I got to deal with Jeremy.

23:36.044 --> 23:37.677
I want him off the show. He's
never allowed on set ever.

23:37.712 --> 23:39.111
You are being so dramatic.
This is, like, not that...

23:39.147 --> 23:40.179
I think you're
downplaying this entire thing

23:40.214 --> 23:41.494
- a little too much.
- I'm not...

23:41.515 --> 23:43.549
- This is...
- Yeah, I'm totally fine.

23:43.584 --> 23:45.117
- Do you want to know why I'm fine?
- I'm... You don't seem fine.

23:45.153 --> 23:46.552
No, I am totally fine.

23:46.587 --> 23:47.886
I'm, like, sitting
here, and I'm doing my job.

23:47.921 --> 23:49.721
- I'm working my ass off.
- Okay.

23:49.756 --> 23:51.223
I'm producing this show with this...

23:51.258 --> 23:52.991
- Okay, okay.
- Pregnant racist chick.

23:53.026 --> 23:55.226
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I mean, this is like manna from heaven.

23:55.229 --> 23:56.039
I don't know what we are talking

23:56.064 --> 23:57.128
- about. I'm sorry.
- My next point here...

23:57.164 --> 23:58.797
You're making me feel crazy right now.

23:58.832 --> 24:00.499
I'm worried about outing a pregnant girl

24:00.534 --> 24:01.733
in front of her family
on national television.

24:01.768 --> 24:03.368
This is who you care about?

24:03.404 --> 24:04.969
You're not yourself, and
you're taking it out on Beth Ann.

24:05.005 --> 24:06.571
Excuse me?

24:06.606 --> 24:08.039
We came down here to bring
a black suitor to the South.

24:08.075 --> 24:09.507
- That was our plan.
- This is the one.

24:09.542 --> 24:10.909
Just that. I feel like
you're jumpy today.

24:10.944 --> 24:12.510
I'm blown away.

24:12.545 --> 24:14.145
I just want to remind you what
we have done this season.

24:14.181 --> 24:15.914
We locked, like, some chick in a room,

24:15.949 --> 24:18.850
hired an extras
casting to come in and lie

24:18.885 --> 24:20.405
- and say that she's her mother.
- Yep.

24:20.420 --> 24:22.420
Okay, we give him an epidural.

24:22.455 --> 24:23.231
We have Ruby's father come in

24:23.256 --> 24:24.222
- with the cameras.
- Rachel, I know...

24:24.257 --> 24:26.023
- But this is the pregnant girl.
- They're fine.

24:26.058 --> 24:27.725
This is who you're mad about?
This is who you care about?

24:27.760 --> 24:28.693
No, I'm worried about you.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.528
I am...

24:30.563 --> 24:32.730
I am totally fine.

24:32.765 --> 24:35.933
Okay? So can we please
go and just blow this up?

24:45.974 --> 24:48.041
Hey, there you are. [Chuckles]

24:50.210 --> 24:51.376
Why the sad face...

24:51.412 --> 24:53.245
other than being doused in champagne?

24:53.280 --> 24:54.880
I don't know.

24:54.916 --> 24:57.082
Maybe it's because I'm
stuck in a McMansion

24:57.117 --> 24:58.851
with three gossipy bitches

24:58.886 --> 25:02.254
while Darius is in Alabama with
little Miss Ku Klux Klan.

25:02.289 --> 25:03.756
[Chuckles] I don't know how those girls

25:03.791 --> 25:06.391
found out about Romeo.

25:06.427 --> 25:08.726
What if I told you I could help you?

25:08.762 --> 25:11.529
How? By sleeping with the entire team?

25:11.565 --> 25:13.398
[Laughs]

25:13.434 --> 25:15.467
I've got a deal for you.

25:15.502 --> 25:18.636
You take my advice,
I'll get you into Darius' room.

25:18.672 --> 25:22.040
You leave all this Romeo
business behind you.

25:22.076 --> 25:23.407
And in return?

25:23.443 --> 25:25.076
You introduce me to your dad,

25:25.111 --> 25:26.611
soften him up a little bit.

25:26.646 --> 25:28.646
I'm looking to diversify my portfolio,

25:28.682 --> 25:32.750
maybe take a minority
interest in a pro football team.

25:32.786 --> 25:36.220
You help me out,
I'll get you in the final two,

25:36.255 --> 25:38.422
and, uh, I'll do everything in my power

25:38.458 --> 25:40.924
to get you to the altar.

25:40.960 --> 25:42.259
What do you say?

25:44.597 --> 25:46.097
Don't worry about the background...

25:46.132 --> 25:48.132
the messier, the better.
Honestly, that's fine with...

25:48.167 --> 25:49.867
Guys.

25:50.536 --> 25:52.403
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:52.438 --> 25:53.670
Um, you know where Rachel is?

25:53.706 --> 25:55.106
Yeah, she's over with "B" cam.

25:55.141 --> 25:56.740
They're gonna shoot from
a different angle.

25:56.775 --> 25:58.308
What's going on? Everything all right?

25:58.343 --> 26:00.076
I don't know if I can
do this, to be honest.

26:00.112 --> 26:02.946
Hey, if you don't want to tell
your parents, then don't.

26:02.982 --> 26:05.516
Yeah, but Rachel said that
this is the only chance

26:05.551 --> 26:06.850
I'm gonna get to tell Darius, and...

26:06.886 --> 26:08.251
I know. I know what she told you.

26:08.286 --> 26:10.754
Just do whatever feels
right for you, okay?

26:10.789 --> 26:12.989
Okay, I'm gonna listen to Rachel.

26:13.025 --> 26:14.924
I think she knows what she's doing.

26:14.959 --> 26:17.427
I'm... I'm sorry that I bothered you.

26:17.462 --> 26:19.429
Thank you.

26:19.464 --> 26:21.131
Okay.

26:21.166 --> 26:23.766
Hey, everyone! How you doing?

26:23.801 --> 26:26.669
I just wanted to say a few words.

26:26.704 --> 26:29.505
Hey, "B" cam, move into position near the back.

26:29.541 --> 26:31.273
mostly to Darius.

26:31.308 --> 26:33.308
Thank you so much for coming
all the way down to Alabama.

26:33.344 --> 26:35.377
[Chuckles] Yeah. Let's
have a big hand for him, y'all.

26:35.413 --> 26:37.713
- [Cheers and applause]
- Mom: So happy to have you.

26:37.749 --> 26:39.515
You're just gonna tell
her, you know, that she...

26:39.551 --> 26:41.283
she's the woman of your
dreams. She's carrying your baby.

26:41.318 --> 26:42.998
Your life wouldn't
be the same without her.

26:43.021 --> 26:44.386
You're gonna give her this.

26:44.422 --> 26:45.820
- Oh, you bought a ring.
- Oh, my God. Yeah.

26:45.856 --> 26:47.122
We think of everything around here.

26:47.158 --> 26:48.790
Oh, it's beautiful.

26:48.825 --> 26:50.692
It also means that you and
I, We share a connection,

26:50.727 --> 26:52.847
[Voice breaking] and in
order to keep that connection,

26:52.863 --> 26:54.563
I have to be honest with you

26:54.598 --> 26:56.831
and with everyone else here tonight

26:56.867 --> 27:02.236
about something that is,
um, not so easy to say.

27:02.272 --> 27:04.505
Okay. I'm pregnant.

27:04.541 --> 27:05.674
- [All gasp]
- What?

27:05.709 --> 27:06.708
- [Coughs]
- What did you say?

27:06.743 --> 27:08.209
- Get Brock.
- Beth Ann!

27:08.244 --> 27:09.578
- Dad: What...
- Uh, no!

27:09.613 --> 27:11.012
What's he doing here?

27:11.048 --> 27:12.647
I came as soon as I
could. I missed you so much.

27:12.683 --> 27:13.915
- What's he doing here?
- What are you doing?

27:13.951 --> 27:16.250
Brock, get up! What are you doing?!

27:16.286 --> 27:18.019
- Brock: You're my girl, Beth Ann.
- [Voice breaking] Do not do this to me!

27:18.055 --> 27:19.720
Y-You've always been my
girl. I love you so much, and...

27:19.755 --> 27:22.523
and now I'm asking I-if
you will be my wife.

27:22.559 --> 27:24.192
- No!
- No?

27:24.227 --> 27:26.194
Hey, hey! Cameras
off! Get that camera off!

27:26.229 --> 27:28.429
- Cameras off! Come on, now!
- What do you mean "no"?

27:28.465 --> 27:29.930
You and me, we need to have

27:29.966 --> 27:31.399
a different kind of
conversation right about now.

27:31.434 --> 27:33.167
- Not right now, Daddy.
- You're carrying my baby.

27:33.203 --> 27:34.602
- You don't know that.
- You're saying it's not mine?

27:34.637 --> 27:36.536
I'm saying that I don't
know whose baby it is.

27:36.572 --> 27:39.355
Beth Ann, whose baby could it be?!

27:43.212 --> 27:44.845
Oh, hell, no!

27:44.880 --> 27:46.080
No. No, no, no.

27:46.115 --> 27:47.114
Man, I never t...

27:47.149 --> 27:48.849
[All shouting indistinctly]

27:48.884 --> 27:50.450
Tell him I never touched her.

27:50.486 --> 27:52.586
You better not have put your
filthy hands on my girl!

27:52.621 --> 27:54.387
- This is why you need to go!
- Rachel!

27:55.657 --> 27:56.889
Rachel!

27:56.925 --> 27:58.525
[All shouting indistinctly]

27:58.560 --> 28:00.427
Brock, this baby is not yours!

28:00.462 --> 28:01.561
Push in from there!

28:01.597 --> 28:02.895
This guy?!

28:02.931 --> 28:04.864
Stop it!! I love him!!

28:04.899 --> 28:06.533
Wait, what? You love me?

28:06.568 --> 28:07.867
I do. I love you.

28:07.902 --> 28:09.636
Pump your brakes. Pump your brakes.

28:09.671 --> 28:11.604
[Crying] I didn't know it
was possible, but I love you.

28:11.640 --> 28:12.805
- Pump your brakes. Pump your brakes.
- What?

28:12.841 --> 28:13.940
Come on. Bring it. Yeah, what?

28:13.975 --> 28:15.842
- I'm he...
- [Shotgun cocks]

28:18.179 --> 28:19.545
Now you get on out of here right now,

28:19.580 --> 28:21.080
or I'm calling the Sheriff.

28:22.416 --> 28:24.050
Go on.

28:24.085 --> 28:25.584
Right now.

28:33.694 --> 28:35.661
What kind of stupid
whore did you turn into?

28:35.696 --> 28:36.828
Hey, watch your mouth, man.

28:36.864 --> 28:38.564
- You shut your mouth.
- Go.

28:40.535 --> 28:42.433
- Whoa!
- Oh.

28:42.469 --> 28:45.671
Rachel? I'm embarrassed right now.

28:45.706 --> 28:47.905
I'm so sorry, Darius.

28:47.940 --> 28:49.674
[Whispering] Here you go. Here you go.

28:49.709 --> 28:51.575
Thanks so much.

28:51.610 --> 28:54.178
- [Beth Ann crying]
- Dad: I'm sorry.

28:54.213 --> 28:55.780
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:55.815 --> 28:57.281
Mm.

28:57.316 --> 28:59.283
- Rachel.
- Oh, my God! I can't help myself!

28:59.318 --> 29:00.417
Rachel?

29:00.452 --> 29:02.019
Beth Ann: [Crying] I'm so sorry.

29:02.055 --> 29:03.654
Just... I'm so happy for us.

29:03.689 --> 29:05.088
Okay.

29:05.123 --> 29:07.424
Come on. [Chuckles]

29:07.459 --> 29:08.958
Come on. Come on.

29:15.499 --> 29:17.265
Welcome home.

29:17.300 --> 29:19.067
Oh, my God. It never ends.

29:19.102 --> 29:21.102
I'm sorry. I just have to talk to you.

29:21.137 --> 29:23.238
Okay. What's up?

29:23.273 --> 29:26.174
Well, the truth is, I
really like you, Darius,

29:26.209 --> 29:28.276
and I was kind of hurt
that you didn't pick me.

29:28.311 --> 29:30.245
You think I wanted to
get attacked by Beth Ann's

29:30.280 --> 29:31.579
meth-head boyfriend?

29:31.614 --> 29:32.947
[Laughs]

29:32.983 --> 29:34.249
<i>No. I got played, Tiffany.</i>

29:34.284 --> 29:35.683
Duh.

29:35.718 --> 29:37.318
And I feel like we're
getting manipulated

29:37.354 --> 29:38.853
every step of the way.

29:38.889 --> 29:40.621
I've been manipulated since
the first day I got here.

29:40.656 --> 29:41.990
Who cares?

29:42.025 --> 29:43.491
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

29:43.526 --> 29:45.459
It's about Romeo.

29:45.495 --> 29:47.095
<i>What about Romeo?</i>

29:47.130 --> 29:48.496
So, what, you're trying to
get rid of Tiffany now?

29:48.531 --> 29:50.464
What? No. I'm trying to help her.

29:50.500 --> 29:53.033
I'm the one who suggested she
clear the air with Darius.

29:53.068 --> 29:54.869
It's called honesty.

29:54.904 --> 29:57.705
Wins every time. It's how
you get what you want.

29:57.740 --> 29:59.373
Oh, just give it up, Chet.

29:59.409 --> 30:01.174
I haven't even started, my friend.

30:01.210 --> 30:02.643
I have not even started.

30:02.678 --> 30:04.211
Finally, you're back.

30:04.246 --> 30:05.979
Um, Rachel, let's go talk in my office.

30:06.015 --> 30:08.481
Let's all talk. Could
everyone step outside

30:08.517 --> 30:10.117
and give us a moment, please?

30:10.852 --> 30:13.253
We weren't working or anything.

30:14.689 --> 30:16.823
[Clears throat]

30:16.858 --> 30:18.959
I don't know what the hell
is wrong with you people!

30:18.994 --> 30:20.827
There's procedures for things like this.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.295
We need to call the police,

30:22.330 --> 30:24.130
get a police report, and then we call HR.

30:24.165 --> 30:25.965
Hey! Hey! Nobody's calling the police.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.534
- That's been decided.
- By you two.

30:27.569 --> 30:28.802
Rachel and I discussed it.

30:28.837 --> 30:31.237
Yeah, no police, no investigation.

30:31.272 --> 30:33.139
That's best for everyone.

30:36.545 --> 30:39.345
Rachel, what do you want to do?

30:39.380 --> 30:41.447
It's your decision, it's not ours.

30:44.385 --> 30:46.352
Look at me. Don't look at them.

30:46.387 --> 30:48.387
Don't look at them
right now. Look at me.

30:48.423 --> 30:51.657
I'm here for you... whatever
you want to do.

30:53.594 --> 30:56.361
Yeah, I want to drop it. I
don't want to go to the police.

30:57.865 --> 30:59.030
Are you sure?

30:59.066 --> 31:00.499
Yes, she's sure.

31:00.534 --> 31:02.868
- What part of that did you not get?
- Wait...

31:04.638 --> 31:07.072
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

31:07.107 --> 31:08.807
Both of you.

31:11.911 --> 31:14.045
[Door slams]

31:14.081 --> 31:16.114
What the hell's happening to our family?

31:16.149 --> 31:18.783
Ever since Coleman's got
here, everything's gone to hell.

31:18.818 --> 31:21.619
That boy's like a cancer.
We need to cut him out.

31:21.654 --> 31:23.254
How?

31:23.290 --> 31:24.856
You know, I think
Rachel's in love with that guy.

31:24.891 --> 31:26.491
I've never seen her like this before.

31:27.927 --> 31:29.760
[Chuckles]

31:29.796 --> 31:31.529
Oh.

31:31.564 --> 31:32.997
I have.

31:39.772 --> 31:42.439
Hello, gorgeous.

31:42.475 --> 31:45.709
What are you doing right now?

31:45.744 --> 31:48.145
[Laughs]

31:48.180 --> 31:52.582
[Insects chirping]

31:52.618 --> 31:56.487
And now it is time for
tonight's elimination ceremony.

31:56.522 --> 31:59.456
Four of our ladies have
won keys to Darius' heart.

31:59.492 --> 32:01.324
One, unfortunately, has not.

32:01.359 --> 32:03.159
All right, let's widen out and
get the whole room, please.

32:03.194 --> 32:05.996
And that lady tonight will
need to say farewell.

32:06.031 --> 32:07.063
Darius.

32:13.639 --> 32:15.438
Chantal.

32:21.279 --> 32:23.246
All right, let's go tight on Darius.

32:23.281 --> 32:24.880
Yael.

32:30.155 --> 32:32.155
[Sighs]

32:32.190 --> 32:33.488
Jameson.

32:33.524 --> 32:34.823
Ooh.

32:41.832 --> 32:43.131
Thank you.

32:48.973 --> 32:51.506
I've said this before.

32:51.542 --> 32:54.008
Honesty is probably the
most important thing

32:54.044 --> 32:55.210
in terms of...

32:55.245 --> 32:57.279
I'm sorry. I need to say something.

32:57.314 --> 32:58.813
- I need to tell the truth.
- Beth Ann...

32:58.848 --> 33:01.950
No! I want America to know...

33:01.985 --> 33:03.485
that you never touched me

33:03.520 --> 33:05.954
as much as I might have wanted you to.

33:05.989 --> 33:08.890
You've been a perfect gentleman,

33:08.925 --> 33:10.725
and there's no way that you could be

33:10.760 --> 33:13.027
the father of my child...

33:13.063 --> 33:16.230
unless, somehow, you chose to be.

33:16.265 --> 33:17.999
Push in on Darius for that.

33:18.034 --> 33:20.134
Let's really make him uncomfortable.

33:20.169 --> 33:21.903
I know I came here a different person

33:21.938 --> 33:24.205
with some not-so-good ideas.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.407
But please don't cut me tonight.

33:26.442 --> 33:27.374
Please.

33:27.410 --> 33:28.909
This is gonna be good.

33:28.944 --> 33:31.812
Let me show you that we
can make a great team,

33:31.847 --> 33:34.014
that we can make a family.

33:34.049 --> 33:35.416
Beth Ann...

33:35.451 --> 33:38.219
I'm sorry. I can't.

33:38.254 --> 33:42.555
But... it took guts to
stand up like you just did,

33:42.591 --> 33:46.093
and that's why I want
to put some money aside

33:46.128 --> 33:49.830
for your kid's college fund.

33:49.865 --> 33:51.431
Come here.

33:51.466 --> 33:53.667
That's a classy act.

33:53.702 --> 33:56.336
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

34:00.375 --> 34:02.142
Tiffany.

34:08.449 --> 34:10.183
All right, guys. Let's position up to get

34:10.217 --> 34:12.752
those cameras onto Beth
Ann when she comes out crying.

34:15.056 --> 34:19.725
Beth Ann, it is time
for us to bid you adieu.

34:19.761 --> 34:21.960
Sayonara. Adiós.

34:21.996 --> 34:23.395
Shalom.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.864
Two each, honey. Game on.

34:25.900 --> 34:27.399
Bitch, please.

34:34.275 --> 34:35.974
[Crying] Get out of my face!

34:36.009 --> 34:38.443
She was obnoxious, but
that was really sad.

34:40.246 --> 34:41.946
Rachel. Rachel!

34:41.982 --> 34:43.282
- Rachel: Listen.
- What the hell was that?

34:43.317 --> 34:44.483
I-I have no idea. Beth
Ann just, like...

34:44.518 --> 34:46.051
I'm so sick of this crap!

34:46.085 --> 34:47.552
Listen. I thought, as a
woman, that you came off great.

34:47.587 --> 34:49.120
You seemed, like, so
sensitive to her situation.

34:49.156 --> 34:50.789
Look, I just kicked a
crying, pregnant lady

34:50.824 --> 34:52.489
out of my house... my house.

34:52.525 --> 34:55.592
All right, I'm so over
you. I'm so over this shit!

34:55.628 --> 34:57.595
Wait. D... "D." Darius! Darius!

34:57.630 --> 34:58.730
<i>Who banged the Ra...</i>

34:58.765 --> 35:00.264
<i>Hey! Rach!</i>

35:00.300 --> 35:01.999
<i>Who banged the racist?!</i>

35:05.327 --> 35:06.994
[Sighs]

35:09.231 --> 35:10.531
Hi, Quinn.

35:10.566 --> 35:12.199
How you doing?

35:12.234 --> 35:15.102
Um, curious as to why
you are in my office

35:15.138 --> 35:18.639
talking to me right now, but
other than that, great.

35:18.674 --> 35:20.874
I just had to ask, uh,

35:20.909 --> 35:26.213
why did you send that
gorgeous, charming, sober man away?

35:26.248 --> 35:28.782
Who, Booth? I had work to do.

35:28.817 --> 35:30.083
No, you didn't.

35:30.118 --> 35:32.385
Actually, yes. We had an emergency.

35:32.420 --> 35:34.788
There's no such thing as
an entertainment emergency.

35:34.823 --> 35:35.989
This wasn't about the show.

35:36.024 --> 35:38.591
What, then? Rachel?

35:38.626 --> 35:41.928
Have you asked yourself why
you care so much about that girl?

35:41.963 --> 35:43.897
[Scoffs] Okay. Here we go.

35:43.932 --> 35:46.232
This will be rich.

35:46.267 --> 35:48.301
I'm gonna tell you the one thing

35:48.336 --> 35:51.770
no one else is brave
enough to say to your face.

35:51.806 --> 35:53.138
You're lonely.

35:53.174 --> 35:54.807
[Laughs]

35:54.842 --> 35:56.141
Lonely?

35:56.177 --> 35:59.011
I am surrounded all day.

35:59.046 --> 36:02.348
I spend half my time
screaming at people to leave me alone.

36:02.383 --> 36:07.352
I'm talking about
intimacy, Quinn... "In-to-me-see."

36:07.387 --> 36:09.287
Are you having a stroke?

36:09.323 --> 36:11.289
This show... It consumes you!

36:11.325 --> 36:14.126
It's all you have, but
it doesn't have to be.

36:14.161 --> 36:16.095
You don't have to die
alone like your dad.

36:16.130 --> 36:18.430
[Sighs] Got it.

36:18.465 --> 36:22.934
And I'm supposed to be
taking advice from you?

36:22.969 --> 36:28.005
Underpaid, forever single,
pathetic reality-show therapist?

36:28.041 --> 36:31.710
Who actually cares about you.

36:31.745 --> 36:34.011
Don't sabotage it with this guy, Quinn.

36:34.047 --> 36:36.414
He may be your last chance.

36:39.485 --> 36:42.519
[Door opens, shuts]

36:42.555 --> 36:45.223
[Scoffs]

36:45.258 --> 36:47.091
[Beeping]

36:55.768 --> 36:57.701
[Door opens]

36:57.737 --> 36:59.202
Hey. There you are.

36:59.238 --> 37:00.638
Hey.

37:00.673 --> 37:02.038
Look, are you sure about
this whole thing...

37:02.074 --> 37:03.374
the not calling the cops?

37:03.409 --> 37:04.841
Yeah, I am. I really think it's right...

37:04.877 --> 37:06.477
It's the right thing to do.

37:06.512 --> 37:07.844
I got to ask you...

37:07.880 --> 37:09.346
Why didn't you tell me
about this whole thing?

37:09.382 --> 37:11.014
Right when it happened, why
didn't you just tell me?

37:11.049 --> 37:14.617
Do you not trust me? And if you
don't trust me, then... why?

37:16.755 --> 37:19.089
Quinn says that you're my Chet.

37:23.095 --> 37:25.162
I don't even know what that means.

37:25.197 --> 37:28.531
I do know I don't have a
lot in common with Chet.

37:28.566 --> 37:30.733
I know I'm not gonna leave
you here to fester for 10...

37:30.769 --> 37:32.234
How long's Quinn been doing this?

37:32.270 --> 37:33.202
10 years.

37:33.237 --> 37:36.038
10 years? Yeah, no.

37:36.073 --> 37:41.511
I see who you are,
Rachel, and who you can be.

37:41.546 --> 37:43.946
I am taking you out of
here at the end of the season

37:43.981 --> 37:45.547
whether Quinn likes it or not.

37:51.422 --> 37:52.387
- Hey.
- Hmm?

37:52.423 --> 37:54.356
- Hey.
- Yeah?

37:54.391 --> 37:57.226
Do you want this?

37:57.261 --> 37:59.594
Yeah, I do.

37:59.630 --> 38:02.063

39:02.858 --> 39:05.592
Possibly, but I have a big day tomorrow,

39:05.627 --> 39:09.128
something that I kind
of set into motion.

39:09.163 --> 39:12.665
