WEBVTT

00:06.540 --> 00:08.742
Previously on Rogue...

00:08.776 --> 00:10.078
When did you
start running guns?

00:10.678 --> 00:12.480
My story's finally
coming together.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.115
Going to meet with
the last big piece right now.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.384
- He said he ain't comin'.
- Fuck's sake.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.418
Deakins?

00:17.451 --> 00:18.852
This is your information,
your mystery.

00:18.886 --> 00:19.887
You follow him.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.256
Some white guy
doesn't randomly show up

00:22.290 --> 00:23.991
to talk to Cups
in the middle of nowhere

00:24.024 --> 00:25.426
then dies in a fireball?

00:25.459 --> 00:27.495
All I'm saying is
maybe it wasn't an accident.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.563
Do you know what Mr. Hutchings
did for a living?

00:29.597 --> 00:31.065
He's a reporter or some shit?

00:31.099 --> 00:32.200
That's Marty Stein.

00:32.232 --> 00:34.402
Now we believe
one of Stein's clients

00:34.435 --> 00:36.870
is supplying arms
to our enemies overseas.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.106
Through Stein, we get him.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.341
Someone snatched
a redwell from my office.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.575
My problem is some reporter.

00:41.609 --> 00:44.112
Adam Hutchings somehow
got his hands on the contents

00:44.145 --> 00:45.579
I need you to find the leak.

00:45.613 --> 00:48.048
We have a very tight
fucking leash on you, Kelly.

00:48.082 --> 00:50.584
I have some people that I gotta
get away from and I mean, quick.

00:50.618 --> 00:51.852
Your passport
and the other stuff

00:51.885 --> 00:53.087
AJ put together for you.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.922
Listen, Roberts...
No!

00:54.955 --> 00:56.957
You wanna go?
Go.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.093
I'll say goodbye
to your dad for you.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.428
Can I help you?

01:01.929 --> 01:03.597
She wouldn't
just leave like that.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.799
She's in trouble.
I know she is.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.567
- Yo, D.
- 'Sup.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.503
Thanks for comin'
to our part of town.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.571
Just as fuckin' cold
out here, man.

02:17.605 --> 02:18.639
Yeah, man. I hear you.

02:18.672 --> 02:19.940
Chipped a tooth on my coffee.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.314
God! Go, go!
Get the fuck out of here, go!

02:28.682 --> 02:30.851
Oh, my God!
Fuck! Fuck!

02:35.023 --> 02:36.790
There you go! Oh!

02:36.824 --> 02:38.192
Get away, man.

02:38.226 --> 02:39.827
Yo, Dre, you short, man.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.629
It's fucking cold
out there, Cups.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.663
Let me ask you something,

02:42.696 --> 02:43.864
you think this dick
gonna suck itself?

02:43.897 --> 02:45.133
Cups! Cups!

02:45.833 --> 02:46.834
They shot D dead.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.869
- Who done it?
- Breeds.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.338
They shot him down.

02:56.644 --> 02:57.711
All right.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.149
So what was Ethan Kelly doing

03:01.182 --> 03:03.051
breaking into Hutchings' house.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.486
Hutchings didn't have
a pot to piss in.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.687
Well, maybe Kelly
didn't know that

03:06.720 --> 03:07.755
until he got inside.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.923
- So, it's a coincidence?
- If it quacks like a duck...

03:10.891 --> 03:13.727
Our reporter meets with Cups.
10 minutes later, he's dead.

03:13.761 --> 03:16.697
Then we find a former Army
Intel officer in his house

03:16.730 --> 03:18.366
and before we can
even question him,

03:18.399 --> 03:20.568
someone pulls some strings
and he's released.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.703
Doesn't sound like
a duck to me.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.972
Benny, how we doing
on the Hutchings search?

03:25.005 --> 03:27.241
No tax returns filed
for three years.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.577
Insurance policy canceled
six months ago.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.313
Failure to pay premiums
and the DMV says,

03:32.346 --> 03:33.747
he drives a Ford Focus.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.149
He has a car.
Where is it?

03:35.183 --> 03:36.250
I'm all over it.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.220
All right, everybody
shut up for a second.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.257
We had two fatal shootings
this morning at 1100

03:43.291 --> 03:44.392
in Winnetka.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.528
The DOA's name is
Charles Henley.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.597
As in son of Judge Henley.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.366
DOA number two's name
is Derius Pierce.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.402
Runs with the
13th Street Kings.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.604
They start whacking each other
in the hood, that's one thing.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.173
They start playing their
reindeer games in the suburbs,

03:59.207 --> 04:01.442
tax-paying citizens
start to get dead.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.711
And we're gonna make
an example of this shooter.

04:04.112 --> 04:05.346
You shut down
the Kings' street ops

04:05.379 --> 04:07.215
until the name floats
to the top of this shit bowl.

04:07.948 --> 04:08.982
Bring him in.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.120
Come on, you fucker!

04:14.122 --> 04:15.589
- Fuck off!
- Man, shut the fuck up.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.225
- You're under arrest.
- Look, hold on!

04:17.891 --> 04:19.726
- What the hell!
- You know I didn't do shit, man!

04:28.636 --> 04:31.439
A real estate deal?
That's all you came up with?

04:31.472 --> 04:34.007
Why would Hutchings care about
some crappy apartment building?

04:34.275 --> 04:36.277
Well, according to Scott Newcomb,
that's all they talked about.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.811
Uh-huh.
And what did Stein say?

04:38.312 --> 04:39.480
Well, I didn't tell him.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.981
Scott Newcomb's not the leak.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.316
So, you're nowhere.

04:42.350 --> 04:45.253
Listen, why don't you try talking
to a fuckin' lawyer all day long?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.455
I'd have a better chance
of talking to a corpse.

04:47.488 --> 04:51.125
Speaking of, I hear your dad got
promoted at the, uh, grocery store.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.328
Maybe I should stop by and
give him my congratulations.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.331
It's been two days, Roberts.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.067
Two fuckin' days.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.436
I need you to earn
Marty's trust.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.604
If you can't find him
in a week...

05:03.637 --> 05:05.973
There's a fund raiser.
Tonight at his house.

05:06.274 --> 05:07.441
And you're invited?

05:07.475 --> 05:08.476
I'm workin' on it, yeah.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.843
Well, get invited.

05:18.852 --> 05:19.853
What?

05:20.321 --> 05:21.755
If you're lookin' for an
apology for what happened

05:21.789 --> 05:23.591
- to your friend, it's not common...
- Ah, fuck you, fuck you,

05:23.624 --> 05:24.792
AJ had nothing to do with this.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.294
Oh, that's right,
he's an innocent.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.628
- That's right, yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:28.362 --> 05:31.131
Who, being innocent,
has ever perished?

05:31.832 --> 05:34.535
Where were the upright
ever destroyed?

05:34.802 --> 05:35.936
That's Job.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.705
You know, if you missed
that day in Sunday school.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.541
So, we're doing God's work,
is that it?

05:40.574 --> 05:42.376
Whatever you need
to tell yourself, pal.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.348
We done?

06:04.064 --> 06:05.566
Who're you protecting, hmm?

06:17.911 --> 06:21.048
If you just left Kelly alone
you wouldn't be in this shit.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.717
Why is Ethan Kelly
so important to you?

06:27.054 --> 06:29.257
Who the fuck have you
been talking to, hmm?

06:31.091 --> 06:32.260
Ah.

06:37.398 --> 06:38.499
Just think.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.100
Maybe someday
it'll come back to you.

06:48.709 --> 06:49.710
Yeah.

06:54.948 --> 06:55.949
Can I help you?

06:56.817 --> 06:58.252
Tyson Ballard, Attorney at law.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.621
You any good?

07:01.054 --> 07:02.122
We'll see, won't we.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.156
Mmm.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.794
I represent the fine
young gentlemen

07:06.827 --> 07:09.763
that you have inappropriately
detained this afternoon.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.932
They were associating with
known criminals. That's PC.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.602
You mean they were associating
with known black people.

07:14.635 --> 07:15.736
That's BS.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.338
Well, in that neighborhood
that's six of one.

07:18.472 --> 07:19.640
You're very funny.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.742
But here's where we stand.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.278
On the one hand, you can
keep my clients here

07:24.312 --> 07:26.146
and I can start
filing lawsuits.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.048
Including but not limited to,

07:28.081 --> 07:30.451
false imprisonment,
kidnapping and assault.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.820
Of course, there's the federal
civil rights violations,

07:32.853 --> 07:34.622
my personal favorites.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.956
On the other hand,

07:35.989 --> 07:38.426
you can let my clients go and
get back to your crossword.

07:41.329 --> 07:42.463
Your choice.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.515
Looks like I am pretty good,
after all.

08:06.654 --> 08:07.988
Wait two hours,

08:09.222 --> 08:11.058
then hit the
motherfuckers again.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.766
Who's that crazy Greek
who pushes a rock

08:18.799 --> 08:21.034
up the hill until it rolls
down the other side.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.405
Kojak. "Who loves ya, baby?"

08:25.005 --> 08:26.540
It's the best TV cop ever.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.376
Dead before I was born.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.044
Then Jane Rizzoli.
There's a copper.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.113
Legs up to here and then some.

08:33.145 --> 08:34.347
Ah, here we go again.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.784
Which one do you want?

08:36.817 --> 08:38.818
I don't know, they're both
big motherfuckers.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.359
Ya'll got time for a sit down?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.161
Get in the back.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.705
It's kinda cold to be sittin'
in your vehicle.

08:57.738 --> 08:58.839
State of mind, Cups.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.574
State of frost for the ass,
is what it is.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.877
All right, look,
I've been thinking, all right?

09:05.078 --> 09:06.246
We both fuckin' ourselves up.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.081
Why not take a time off
for a second?

09:08.115 --> 09:10.317
One, because you're
a fuckin' scumbag,

09:10.350 --> 09:12.886
two, because you're
a fuckin' scumbag.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.221
You need me to keep goin'?

09:14.254 --> 09:16.189
Damn. Come on, man.

09:16.457 --> 09:17.591
We the victims here, all right?

09:17.625 --> 09:19.059
It was my boy Derius,
that got shot down

09:19.092 --> 09:21.328
in the street like a dog,
so why ya'll hasslin' us?

09:21.361 --> 09:23.230
You put 'em on a corner,
we pick 'em up.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.732
Yeah, my shot had 'em
back slingin'

09:24.765 --> 09:26.166
before ya'll can
finish the paperwork.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.635
We know how this shit works.

09:28.469 --> 09:30.471
Come on, now, we can save
a lot of time and money.

09:31.439 --> 09:33.173
I know ya'll not interested
in that piddly street shit.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.575
So, just tell me
what ya'll are lookin' for

09:34.608 --> 09:36.043
and I'll go get it for you.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.244
I can return to earning

09:37.277 --> 09:39.212
and ya'll can get back to
pretending you make a difference.

09:41.148 --> 09:44.084
The guy who shot Derius
also shot a Judge's son.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.655
We want the shooter, Cups.
Alive.

09:52.626 --> 09:53.761
All right.

09:54.728 --> 09:55.963
I can do that for you,

09:56.464 --> 09:58.131
if you people lay off
my business.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.571
What was Hutchings
doing with you in the yards?

10:03.604 --> 10:05.439
Ho, ho, ho, shit!

10:05.473 --> 10:07.407
That's my skinny
white nigger, man.

10:07.441 --> 10:08.742
Talkin' about makin' me famous.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.679
Doin' some article on me
about "The Life in the Life".

10:12.613 --> 10:14.147
I said, "Shit, why not, man.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.149
As long as 50 gets to play
me in the movie", right?

10:16.650 --> 10:17.851
Hutchings is dead.

10:18.652 --> 10:19.653
Hmm,

10:19.687 --> 10:21.154
well there goes lunch
with Denzel.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.458
We know he was waiting
for someone else, who was it?

10:24.692 --> 10:26.159
Oh, that's my
financial advisor.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.129
Buy low, sell high,
report nothing.

10:29.830 --> 10:30.998
God bless America, man.

10:33.667 --> 10:34.768
We got us a deal?

10:39.372 --> 10:40.373
Yeah.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.010
Smart.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.706
Whoa! Yo.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.309
What's up, boss?

11:16.343 --> 11:17.511
What's up, man?

11:18.979 --> 11:21.782
Hey, man, shit!
That's some good shit, man!

11:21.815 --> 11:22.850
Yeah.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.885
It's fuckin' poetry, my nigga.

11:27.555 --> 11:29.690
- Hey, man, this nigga Rondo, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.592
This nigga, Rondo,
says Cube is the shit.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.261
- Nigga, I had to cap his ass, man.
- Thank you.

11:34.562 --> 11:35.563
Thank you.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.365
- Thank you very much.
- This nigga don't know shit, man.

11:39.700 --> 11:40.768
Fuck that.

11:41.735 --> 11:42.836
Oh, man.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.171
Yeah.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.339
So, what the fuck
is so important?

11:47.675 --> 11:49.242
My nigga, they killed D, man.

11:51.444 --> 11:52.713
Who killed D?

11:53.246 --> 11:54.347
Breeds.

11:56.684 --> 11:58.051
I mean, I figure
if we blow back

11:58.085 --> 12:00.187
all kinds of shit
gonna fuck us up, right?

12:00.220 --> 12:01.889
Look, I spoke
to that Fed lady, man.

12:01.922 --> 12:02.990
The blonde one
with the titties.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.391
She said she gonna
lay off our shit,

12:04.424 --> 12:05.893
if we hold off our retaliation.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.695
Fuck that shit, man!

12:08.729 --> 12:09.930
Fuck them niggas.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.000
Kill the motherfuckers
that killed D.

12:13.033 --> 12:15.235
Kill all the motherfuckers
if you have to.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.306
Yeah, but you always the one
that's urging caution, boss.

12:21.609 --> 12:22.743
You don't see it right now,

12:22.776 --> 12:24.411
but this is what's
good for business.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.483
All right, Marlon.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.057
No, no not now.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.258
I know he's home.

12:38.626 --> 12:40.127
Now's really not a good time.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.962
Do I look like I give a fuck?

12:44.665 --> 12:47.367
- Sorry.
- It's okay, I'm rather busy now, Talia.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.902
Why did you close my salon?

12:48.936 --> 12:50.203
Does your brother know
you're here?

12:50.237 --> 12:52.740
You think I need Marlon's
permission to talk to you?

12:52.773 --> 12:55.575
Why did you shut down my salon?

12:55.609 --> 12:58.278
Oh, my God.
That was weeks ago, Talia.

12:58.578 --> 12:59.980
It's old news, move on.

13:00.013 --> 13:03.083
That was my salon
and I want an answer.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.618
- You want an answer?
- Yes!

13:04.652 --> 13:05.986
Oh, okay.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.956
You were throwing parties
there almost every night,

13:08.989 --> 13:11.224
one of your friends OD'ed
in the back room...

13:11.258 --> 13:12.826
I did my fucking job!

13:13.360 --> 13:15.829
I cleaned enough of your dirty
fucking money for you, didn't I?

13:15.863 --> 13:19.132
You brought the salon to the
attention of the Chicago PD.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.801
That was brilliant, Talia.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.502
That was fan-fucking-tastic.

13:22.836 --> 13:25.138
I told Marlon not to you
run it in the first place

13:25.172 --> 13:30.110
because you contaminate
everything you touch.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.980
- Fuck you.
- Ah, well, as I'm sure

13:33.013 --> 13:35.949
you would delight in that opportunity...

13:37.685 --> 13:40.520
...it's gonna have to wait
another time.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.589
You're fucking kidding me.

13:42.622 --> 13:45.458
I'm rather busy right now. I
have to get ready for a party.

13:45.793 --> 13:47.594
Betsy will show you out.

13:47.627 --> 13:48.796
Betsy!

13:49.663 --> 13:51.665
Fuck this.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.251
Okay, okay.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.336
Mmm.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.325
I thought this might
jog your memory.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.728
I told you that I did not
speak to anyone.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.799
That's not what
Ethan Kelly said.

14:59.967 --> 15:02.269
He said you know
all about the money.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.438
Those soldiers
he killed in Pakistan.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.541
Now, somebody opened up to you
about the cover-up.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.477
We just wanna know who.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.946
I'm a cop. It's what I do.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.015
I worked it out.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.483
Deputy Chief Campbell,

15:17.150 --> 15:18.819
he thinks you're not
that good a cop.

15:20.053 --> 15:23.423
He thinks you might have had
some help on the inside.

15:23.791 --> 15:24.892
Talk to me, Travis.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.564
Fuckin' bitch!

16:20.013 --> 16:21.648
What're you doing with my gun?

16:29.689 --> 16:31.191
What the fuck happened to you?

16:31.825 --> 16:33.693
- Give me that.
- Okay, sure.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.330
Where the hell have you been?

16:37.364 --> 16:38.431
Has anyone been here?

16:38.465 --> 16:39.699
No!

16:48.541 --> 16:49.642
What're you doing?

16:49.676 --> 16:50.677
Shh!

16:54.014 --> 16:55.815
Would you just tell me
what's going on?

17:01.721 --> 17:03.390
Holy shit!

17:05.224 --> 17:07.460
You need to take
this to your dad.

17:07.493 --> 17:09.396
You all need to leave, all of you,
Shelly, all of you.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.664
- You can go to grandma's.
- Cleveland?

17:11.698 --> 17:14.666
- Are you kidding?
- This is not debatable, Evie.

17:19.071 --> 17:20.140
What is this?

17:20.173 --> 17:21.407
I was trying to find you.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.411
No.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.481
Mom, please stop it!

17:28.515 --> 17:30.617
You're...
You're really freaking me out!

17:36.689 --> 17:37.958
I'm sorry, baby.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.195
I just got myself into
a lot trouble and...

17:44.097 --> 17:45.865
it's gonna take me
a while to fix it.

17:46.967 --> 17:48.335
That's why you gotta
go to your dad's,

17:48.368 --> 17:50.870
and I'll call him, I'll explain
everything to him and Shelley.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.805
It's gonna be okay.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.474
I promise.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.244
But we need to leave now, okay?

17:57.911 --> 17:58.946
Okay.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.118
Let's go.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.998
Honestly, didn't think
I'd see you again.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.200
Listen, I wanna apologize
for leaving like that.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.434
- Mmm, not a problem.
- It's not really...

18:21.468 --> 18:22.769
It's the 21st century.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.804
You're certainly not
my first man in uniform.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.574
- I'm not?
- Mmm-mmm.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.609
I've had more soldiers in me
than Fort Bragg.

18:31.979 --> 18:33.846
Really don't have a
sense of humor, do you?

18:37.084 --> 18:39.819
I have to go.
A boring, work-related party.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.222
We can hook up later,
if you're not busy.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.757
You know, there's, um, there's
something I wanted to tell you.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.362
I love boring parties.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.443
Judge asks my client
if he's got anything to add.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.313
This sonofabitch stands up, looks
the judge right in the eye,

19:06.346 --> 19:07.981
and says, "Fuck you,
Your Honor."

19:09.516 --> 19:11.851
Judge Bloom, I swear to God,
doesn't miss a beat,

19:11.884 --> 19:13.620
responds, "Motion denied."

19:15.322 --> 19:16.823
Do you mind
if I borrow him for a minute?

19:16.856 --> 19:18.191
God's honest, I swear to God.

19:18.691 --> 19:19.826
It gets better.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.794
Marty, I want you
to meet Ethan Kelly.

19:21.828 --> 19:22.962
He's retired army.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.498
He's also one semester shy
of graduating Harvard Law.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.234
Marty's a fabulous patriot.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.702
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
- No, no, pleasure's mine.

19:30.137 --> 19:31.171
Over here, Marty.

19:31.571 --> 19:32.739
Excuse me.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.641
I'm just gonna use
the restroom.

19:34.674 --> 19:35.842
Okay.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.899
- You all right?
- Yeah, you?

20:00.433 --> 20:02.001
Well, I need...
I need your help.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.105
I know that you're workin'
another task force, right?

20:06.573 --> 20:09.442
I just need you to run the
Federal database on Ethan Kelly.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.744
Grace, I'm on the street,
you know?

20:11.778 --> 20:13.680
A lowly cog, at that.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.982
They don't give me
access codes.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.351
Yeah, but you're creative.
We both know that.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.953
Look, if I get caught,
on a good day, it's my job,

20:21.421 --> 20:22.722
on a bad one, my ass.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.296
Kelly did that to you?

20:31.364 --> 20:33.600
He can help me bring down
the people who did.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.069
Yeah, like who?

20:36.103 --> 20:37.270
Campbell.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.472
Deputy Chief Campbell?

20:39.906 --> 20:43.009
Campbell is tied up in this
in ways you cannot imagine.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.043
Trust me.

20:45.312 --> 20:47.480
I really think that Ethan Kelly
can help me connect the dots.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.718
Yeah, I mean Kelly's
in the wind, you know.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.421
Just, just live a long and
happy and let him stay there.

20:54.787 --> 20:57.424
They had me chained-up in a
basement for three fuckin' days.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.791
They beat the shit out of me.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.461
I thought I was dead, Sarah,
but I got out.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.465
And Kelly's my best shot

21:06.266 --> 21:07.467
and I need your fuckin' help.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.001
I'm begging you.

21:10.337 --> 21:12.739
You gotta help me, please.
Will you help me?

21:34.161 --> 21:35.628
Any word on Grace Travis?

21:35.662 --> 21:38.165
We're not getting any pings on any
of the cell numbers you listed.

21:38.631 --> 21:39.666
Credit cards?

21:40.032 --> 21:41.134
Nothin' yet.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.172
Keep on her. She'll raise
her head sooner or later.

21:45.538 --> 21:46.606
Sir.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.678
My niece is graduating
from UC Law this spring

21:51.711 --> 21:53.480
and she just actually
sent Marty her resume.

21:53.513 --> 21:54.614
Oh, smart girl.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.649
So, you think the Stein firm
is a good place for her

21:56.683 --> 21:58.251
to kick start her career.
That's interesting.

21:58.285 --> 22:00.587
Yeah, well, put it this way.
I plan on dying at my desk.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.455
Oh, yeah?

22:02.489 --> 22:03.656
Excuse me.

22:03.690 --> 22:04.724
Enjoy.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.532
The cheap thing to do?
The efficient thing to do

22:12.565 --> 22:14.467
would be to nuke
the whole shitload of 'em.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.035
Hey, if it was up to me...

22:16.068 --> 22:17.304
Meet somebody who it is up to.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.206
Bobby! Bobby!

22:20.540 --> 22:21.708
Come here!

22:22.809 --> 22:24.311
What are you doin'?
Leave the girls alone.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.546
Meet General Lance Howard.

22:26.579 --> 22:27.880
- How you doin'?
- Our guest of honor.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.015
Good to meet you.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.650
- Where's Cynthia?
- Burning the midnight oil,

22:30.683 --> 22:32.719
- comes with the job.
- Definitely his better half.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.788
I've been following
the Brewster case. Impressive.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.357
- Why, thank you.
- Where's your drink?

22:37.590 --> 22:38.958
It's probably not
the best time.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.493
Fuck them,
you're amongst friends.

22:40.527 --> 22:43.230
Friends who paid 32k to be
in the same room with you.

22:43.263 --> 22:44.731
I'll get you a drink,
I'll be back.

22:44.764 --> 22:45.865
Talk.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.172
How are you?

23:00.280 --> 23:01.414
Excuse me, sorry.

23:04.351 --> 23:05.518
How you doin'?

23:07.254 --> 23:08.288
Good.

23:09.556 --> 23:10.923
So, how long you been
workin' for Marty?

23:12.559 --> 23:13.926
Hmm, you think I'm a lawyer?

23:14.361 --> 23:15.428
Oh, you know this party,

23:15.462 --> 23:16.563
I'd say the odds
are pretty good.

23:16.596 --> 23:17.764
I don't know about that.

23:18.465 --> 23:20.066
The guy over there has a beret.

23:20.099 --> 23:22.068
Just got out of the
Federal penitentiary.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.270
What did he do?

23:23.603 --> 23:24.971
I think it was mail fraud,

23:26.038 --> 23:28.241
beating up his wife.
I don't know.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.577
That's Chicki Garrison
over there.

23:30.610 --> 23:33.045
- Mmm.
- Owns a half billion dollar hedge fund.

23:34.213 --> 23:36.249
He has a $10,000 a week
coke habit.

23:36.483 --> 23:37.484
How about you?

23:38.117 --> 23:40.253
What darkness lies behind
a $1000 suit?

23:40.653 --> 23:41.854
- Darkness?
- Yeah.

23:41.888 --> 23:42.922
Wow!

23:42.955 --> 23:44.624
No, man, you talking
to the wrong guy.

23:44.657 --> 23:45.758
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

23:45.792 --> 23:46.859
What are you,
a preacher or something?

23:46.893 --> 23:48.060
Hardly.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.796
- Mmm, no?
- No, no, yeah...

23:50.162 --> 23:51.230
The chandelier, that's mine.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.066
You mean, like,
like you make 'em?

23:54.100 --> 23:56.303
I sell 'em. Antiques, yeah.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.939
Got that from the Casa San
Benedetto in Florence.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.474
Lion's share
specially for Marty.

24:04.611 --> 24:05.645
Well,

24:06.846 --> 24:08.014
if you're ever in the market.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.619
Turn Of The Century Lighting.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.654
It's nice to meet you,
uh, Marlon.

24:15.755 --> 24:16.823
Hey, Marty.

24:16.856 --> 24:17.857
Come here a sec.

24:55.528 --> 24:56.996
What're you doin'
in here, Ethan?

24:58.365 --> 25:00.667
Well, one can only stand
so much small talk.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.635
Ah.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.171
That was a smart move.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.707
Getting invited to my party,
making small talk.

25:08.341 --> 25:10.477
Seeing what you can glean
from my lawyers.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.379
Um, something like that.

25:12.412 --> 25:13.646
Can I ask you a question?

25:13.913 --> 25:14.981
Sure.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.483
Why aren't you doing that?

25:17.817 --> 25:19.919
Well, because I believe
it's a dead end, that's why.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.822
Hmm, have you
found anything out,

25:23.322 --> 25:25.658
other than Sophie Hale
has a thing for the military?

25:28.094 --> 25:29.529
Before Adam Hutchings died,

25:29.562 --> 25:32.331
he, uh, he was looking for
information on the Crown Building.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.735
So, you came in here
to look at the file?

25:41.741 --> 25:43.776
Do you think I'm hiding
something from you?

25:45.745 --> 25:47.547
If you are,
that's, that's your business.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.081
That's comforting,

25:49.582 --> 25:52.519
seeing that I'm not
paying you to investigate me.

25:54.521 --> 25:56.055
So, what's the plan?
You're gonna stick around here,

25:56.088 --> 25:57.824
eat my caviar, drink my liquor?

25:57.857 --> 25:59.358
No, actually, I was thinkin'
about goin' downtown

25:59.392 --> 26:00.893
to your office and
takin' a look around.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.595
I mean, now that
everybody's here.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.030
If you're okay with that.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.398
Yeah, that's okay.

26:05.432 --> 26:07.099
Find the fucking leak, Ethan.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.268
That is the purpose
for which I am paying you.

26:09.301 --> 26:10.470
Yeah.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.907
Hey, before you take off,
I want you to meet

26:14.941 --> 26:16.643
the next senator from Illinois.

26:17.109 --> 26:19.412
Bob, I want you to meet
a good friend of mine.

26:19.446 --> 26:20.613
Retired Army, Ethan Kelly,

26:20.647 --> 26:22.181
this is Alderman, Bob Richmond,

26:22.214 --> 26:23.750
soon to relocate to DC.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.284
Come on, I have to win
the election, first.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.186
- That, you do.
- Well, you got my vote.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.421
Gentlemen.

26:34.293 --> 26:35.762
How's the kid working out?

26:36.496 --> 26:37.997
Too soon to tell.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.582
There you go.

28:07.253 --> 28:08.320
Food's here.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.086
Whoa! Uh...

28:51.564 --> 28:52.799
The delivery guy?

28:53.132 --> 28:54.567
Yeah, why not?

28:54.601 --> 28:57.203
These lawyers were talkin' in front
of the guy like he was invisible.

28:57.536 --> 28:59.105
He walked around
the firm unescorted.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.273
He had access to
anything he wanted.

29:01.540 --> 29:02.775
He could've gone anywhere.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.044
This is the building
security log.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.413
I've circled, you see here,
all the names of everyone

29:07.446 --> 29:10.016
who delivered food to the firm
after 8:00PM

29:10.049 --> 29:11.283
for the past three months.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.585
So, we're off the lawyers?

29:12.619 --> 29:13.620
Well, for now.

29:14.053 --> 29:17.423
Freddy, if one of these names
connects to Hutchings,

29:18.791 --> 29:20.259
then we've found our leak.

29:20.292 --> 29:21.427
Let's go, come on.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.095
Okay, I'll cross-check
the names with, uh,

29:23.129 --> 29:24.997
schools, clubs,
bank statements.

29:25.331 --> 29:26.432
Perfect.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.014
Good night, O'Leary.

30:02.635 --> 30:03.636
Whoa.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.638
Looks like we have a winner.

30:05.672 --> 30:09.241
- A guy named Charles Cooper paid electric...
- Cooper.

30:09.275 --> 30:11.343
Same address,
Hutchings' paid cable,

30:11.711 --> 30:13.612
every month, for six years,
looks like.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.181
Where are you, Cooper?

30:17.116 --> 30:18.150
There you are.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.185
Charles Cooper.

30:19.886 --> 30:22.321
He delivered food from a place
called Edison's bar.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.159
Hmm.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.012
Ever been fucked in a
bathroom stall?

30:46.045 --> 30:47.346
Only when there's no paper.

30:47.814 --> 30:49.882
- Buy me a drink.
- Why the hell would I do that?

30:50.182 --> 30:52.651
So, I know that you're serious about
moving this relationship forward.

30:52.685 --> 30:53.853
You ain't good looking enough
to talk like that.

30:55.254 --> 30:56.889
Cart before the horse,
pretty eyes.

30:57.156 --> 30:59.625
Hmm, so, it's my eyes
you're after, huh?

30:59.658 --> 31:01.694
No, but I was raised
a gentleman.

31:02.061 --> 31:03.062
That's apparent.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.609
Fuck me!

31:25.918 --> 31:27.253
Guess who?

31:27.920 --> 31:29.021
Morning!

31:29.388 --> 31:31.690
Leo, meet my aunty, Ruth.

31:32.258 --> 31:33.359
- Hi.
- Baby.

31:33.760 --> 31:34.894
T, who's this?

31:34.927 --> 31:35.928
Yo, man, Leo.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.130
Hey, what's up?

31:38.430 --> 31:39.598
Sit, baby.

31:39.631 --> 31:42.101
- I'll fix you both a plate.
- Okay.

31:42.769 --> 31:43.770
Thank you.

31:45.271 --> 31:46.272
Hi.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.588
All right, I got into
the database.

32:02.955 --> 32:03.990
Guess, who popped up.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.392
Yeah, I told you. Ethan Kelly.

32:06.793 --> 32:09.161
He was picked up for B&E in
Chicago, a few days ago.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.130
But, no charges were filed.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.600
Why would the feds
be involved in a B&E?

32:14.633 --> 32:17.136
Not a clue.
But he gave a local address.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.638
You hear about Ray Williams?

32:20.807 --> 32:22.474
He's being listed
as a missing person.

32:23.843 --> 32:24.844
What?

32:25.311 --> 32:27.213
So, just be careful, Grace.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.115
If they can
cover up his murder,

32:29.148 --> 32:30.983
they'll have no problem
in making you disappear.

32:31.483 --> 32:32.484
Yeah.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.990
Thank you, Sarah. Thank you.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.326
How long have you two
been together?

32:40.359 --> 32:41.693
Um...

32:42.461 --> 32:43.495
Couple of hours now.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.631
- Give or take, huh?
- Yeah.

32:48.767 --> 32:49.768
All right.

32:50.536 --> 32:52.471
Don't let me
get the hose on you two.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.040
Uh, sorry.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.012
So, Marlon,
what kind of work you into?

33:00.346 --> 33:02.514
Yeah, Marlon,
what kind of work you into?

33:06.185 --> 33:08.020
Oh, oh, shit, I'm sorry,
you're like...

33:08.821 --> 33:10.489
You're like, unemployed
or something.

33:12.358 --> 33:13.359
No, Leo, I work.

33:13.893 --> 33:15.727
That's what's up!
So, what's you racking?

33:16.829 --> 33:18.330
I'm in the chandelier business.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.466
Chandelier's is like,
fancy lights and shit.

33:21.533 --> 33:23.135
Yeah, why,
you're in the market?

33:23.169 --> 33:24.170
Well...

33:24.670 --> 33:27.006
Marlon's in all kinds
of businesses.

33:27.039 --> 33:29.175
He's a real businessman.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.010
- Oh.
- Ain't that right, Marlon?

33:31.043 --> 33:32.644
Well, maybe
we should be working together.

33:33.579 --> 33:34.981
So, Leo,
what is it that you do?

33:35.915 --> 33:37.183
I'm a connector.

33:38.217 --> 33:39.418
- A connector?
- Mmm-hmm.

33:40.386 --> 33:41.387
What do you connect?

33:43.055 --> 33:44.056
- People.
- Hmm.

33:44.891 --> 33:45.892
People, huh?

33:46.258 --> 33:48.861
Yes, kinda like
my specialty, you know?

33:49.395 --> 33:50.396
Bringing people together.

33:50.863 --> 33:51.864
I got this dream,

33:52.164 --> 33:53.732
I want to like,
connect everybody.

33:54.333 --> 33:56.568
Now, I'm not just talking
about Chicago.

33:57.569 --> 34:01.007
I'm talking about Asia,
Paris, Africa...

34:01.040 --> 34:02.208
You know, maybe get the
hook ups there,

34:02.241 --> 34:04.043
I don't know what you're talking,
you know what I'm saying?

34:04.076 --> 34:08.380
Dear, Talia, you don't look so good.
Oh, God!

34:08.414 --> 34:09.514
- Are you okay?
- Hmm.

34:09.547 --> 34:10.716
You're sweating.

34:10.748 --> 34:13.752
Let's pour some cold water
on your face. Come up.

34:13.784 --> 34:15.621
No, it's like...
Oh...

34:17.623 --> 34:21.127
Ugh. I'm so sick.

34:21.527 --> 34:24.263
So, you guys just met
like couple of hours ago, huh?

34:26.431 --> 34:27.433
Hmm.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.569
I know how it is, man.

34:31.103 --> 34:33.438
I know how this is.
Well, Leo...

34:34.440 --> 34:35.806
Italian Leonardo?

34:37.109 --> 34:39.777
Leo, the lion.

34:43.949 --> 34:47.286
Maybe you should get the fuck gone
before I break your fucking legs.

34:48.987 --> 34:49.989
Leo?

35:08.907 --> 35:10.242
See you, Leo.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.619
I thought that
they stoned a woman over there

35:20.652 --> 35:22.321
for looking at a guy
outside of marriage.

35:23.122 --> 35:24.123
They do.

35:25.591 --> 35:28.294
There's gotta be lot of black and
blue hookers under those burkhas.

35:28.327 --> 35:30.762
You know, the Afghanis aren't
as much evil, as you think.

35:31.030 --> 35:34.166
They call it Mut'ah,
it's a fixture of marriage.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.934
So what, you get hitched
for like, 20 minutes?

35:37.103 --> 35:38.170
Exactly.

35:38.504 --> 35:40.039
I knew, I should've enlisted.

35:40.439 --> 35:41.807
They saved me a fortune.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.143
You know, marriage isn't
a word, it's a sentence.

35:46.512 --> 35:47.679
Tell me about it.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.149
I know you stole a file
from the Stein firm

35:50.182 --> 35:51.650
and gave it to Adam Hutchings.

35:54.186 --> 35:55.254
Why?

35:55.287 --> 35:57.156
CC, I'm not here
to get you into trouble.

35:57.189 --> 35:58.190
I'm here to keep you out of it.

36:00.126 --> 36:01.860
You want Marty Stein
as an enemy?

36:02.828 --> 36:04.030
I mean, all I have to do
is send a word.

36:08.467 --> 36:09.468
It's your choice.

36:11.037 --> 36:12.238
I mean it's a shame...

36:13.872 --> 36:15.007
I kinda like you.

36:20.979 --> 36:22.081
Hey, wait.

36:23.049 --> 36:24.050
Wait.

36:25.217 --> 36:26.418
You work for Stein?

36:33.392 --> 36:34.626
You can keep me
out of this shit?

36:34.660 --> 36:37.029
You tell me what I need to know
and I'll see what I can do.

36:37.829 --> 36:38.830
Okay.

36:39.865 --> 36:40.999
I knew this would
come back on me

36:41.033 --> 36:42.368
but the fucking guy
was desperate.

36:42.401 --> 36:44.303
- Who? Hutchings?
- Yeah.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.438
I mean, he was saying
he couldn't pay his rent,

36:47.206 --> 36:49.275
saying, like, all he needed
was one big story.

36:50.076 --> 36:51.610
What was I gonna do?
So, helped the guy out.

36:52.578 --> 36:53.912
By stealing a personnel file?

36:54.380 --> 36:56.048
How's that a big story, hmm?

36:58.417 --> 36:59.418
Fuck if I know.

37:00.752 --> 37:01.753
Let me tell you something,

37:02.954 --> 37:05.724
this works a lot fucking better,
if you tell me everything.

37:05.757 --> 37:06.758
You got me?

37:10.896 --> 37:12.098
It was nothing.

37:13.299 --> 37:16.235
Some, drunk,
black chick, Talia...

37:16.268 --> 37:17.269
Talia, who?

37:18.070 --> 37:19.271
I didn't get her last name.

37:20.272 --> 37:21.473
She comes in the bar one night.

37:22.074 --> 37:24.410
She's all pissed off
'cause Stein closed her salon.

37:24.443 --> 37:27.079
She's saying, um, "Fuck him!"

37:27.113 --> 37:29.615
Saying, uh, saying,

37:29.648 --> 37:31.783
you know, "I know enough about his
business to ruin his white ass."

37:32.751 --> 37:34.453
I thought, she was just
talking shit, you know.

37:34.786 --> 37:35.787
Hmm.

37:36.288 --> 37:38.557
A few days later,
Adam comes in, crying a river.

37:38.824 --> 37:42.994
So, I tell him about the girl
and the salon and, and Marty.

37:45.331 --> 37:46.332
And what else?

37:46.932 --> 37:47.933
What else, CC?

37:48.834 --> 37:51.470
Then he's begging me,
next time, I'm in the firm,

37:51.503 --> 37:52.971
I should look for anything
on this Talia.

37:54.005 --> 37:55.407
Couple of nights later,
I'm up there,

37:55.774 --> 37:56.775
delivering sandwiches.

37:57.109 --> 37:58.910
I slip into the fire room,
but I freaked.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.447
I grabbed the one file
that was sitting out,

38:01.480 --> 38:02.581
I didn't even know what it was.

38:04.250 --> 38:05.484
That's all I did.

38:07.153 --> 38:09.955
I just felt sorry for the
poor bastard, that's all.

38:23.502 --> 38:24.503
Excuse me.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.037
Sam, can you help Mr. Forbidi?

38:27.873 --> 38:28.940
What's this?

38:28.974 --> 38:29.975
Shameless bribery.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.943
Oh, I see, you think
my integrity is for sale?

38:32.178 --> 38:33.179
Right on the street!

38:33.679 --> 38:35.181
You apologized
to Aunt Ruth yet?

38:35.214 --> 38:36.882
Who do you think
gave me the cobbler?

38:57.403 --> 38:58.504
Say, what you wanna say?

38:59.471 --> 39:01.307
I work my ass off, Mar.

39:02.841 --> 39:03.842
No one is saying you didn't.

39:04.176 --> 39:06.712
No one's saying
they give a shit, either.

39:07.313 --> 39:08.480
I'm doing that right now.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.382
We'll find you something else.

39:10.416 --> 39:11.417
Something else?

39:11.717 --> 39:14.220
Closing that salon
was precautionary.

39:14.253 --> 39:15.687
That decision ain't about you,
Talia.

39:15.721 --> 39:16.955
Ain't about me?

39:16.988 --> 39:18.156
It was mine, Mar!

39:18.524 --> 39:20.192
I never had something
that was mine.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.861
Something I built,
something made me proud.

39:22.894 --> 39:24.530
I put everything
into that place.

39:24.563 --> 39:27.399
And you just let big masso
Marty take it away.

39:27.433 --> 39:31.203
Like, I'm some misbehaving child,
needs to be taught a lesson!

39:31.237 --> 39:33.705
And now, you're gonna sit there
and tell me, it ain't about me?

39:34.706 --> 39:36.908
What the fuck else
I gotta be about?

39:36.942 --> 39:39.711
Are you under some illusion
about where all this comes from?

39:39.745 --> 39:42.981
No, no illusion,
this is Marlon's show.

39:43.014 --> 39:44.916
There ain't nothing about T
in the Marlon show.

39:44.950 --> 39:46.918
This is a strange
sounding apology.

39:47.453 --> 39:49.187
Cause, I ain't apologizing.

39:49.421 --> 39:51.122
Cobbler's food drama,
that's on me.

39:51.857 --> 39:55.494
But I need you to hear me
when I say, I love you,

39:55.527 --> 39:59.197
but, sometimes, you're the
biggest bitch in this family.

40:02.301 --> 40:03.435
You want some cobbler?

40:05.103 --> 40:06.104
I fucking hate you.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.610
- I'm serious.
- I'll get the knife.

40:23.455 --> 40:24.623
What are you doing here?

40:24.656 --> 40:27.259
Oh, I could use a bear claw
and a cup of coffee.

40:27.293 --> 40:29.428
Maybe some eggs over easy,
what do you say?

40:43.141 --> 40:44.410
Figured you'd be gone by now.

40:44.943 --> 40:47.313
Well, it turns out, I'm gonna be
here working it for the while.

40:47.346 --> 40:48.447
Hmm.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.349
So, the security business
is good?

40:51.149 --> 40:53.018
I'm working for
Marty Stein's firm now.

40:54.320 --> 40:55.821
- Marty Stein, wow!
- Hmm.

40:56.755 --> 40:59.691
Imagine how far you'd go if you
actually finish law school.

41:08.033 --> 41:09.935
You know, I was reading in
the paper the other day.

41:09.968 --> 41:13.839
There were talking about
10 guys died here, 14 there.

41:14.440 --> 41:15.674
City's turned into a war zone.

41:15.941 --> 41:17.943
Yeah, well, lucky for us, they're
only killing each other.

41:17.976 --> 41:18.977
Oh, I don't know.

41:20.346 --> 41:22.213
There was a lady that was walking
her dog the other day and took a...

41:23.449 --> 41:24.816
straight bullet in the neck.

41:24.850 --> 41:26.284
Well, lucky for me,
I hate dogs.

41:30.356 --> 41:31.357
You know, what...

41:32.858 --> 41:33.959
I'll give you my cell number.

41:36.695 --> 41:39.698
And I want you to call me
if you need anything, okay?

41:41.232 --> 41:42.300
What would I need?

41:43.234 --> 41:44.503
Oh, it's just,
one of those, uh...

41:45.303 --> 41:47.573
"I've fallen."
I can get up things.

41:55.313 --> 41:57.649
Hey, Deakins,
I just put a file on your desk.

41:58.216 --> 42:02.020
Adam Hutchings, 2005, Ford Focus,
towed three weeks ago,

42:02.053 --> 42:03.722
14 unpaid parking tickets.

42:04.556 --> 42:05.657
- Thank you, Benny.
- Yeah.

42:06.958 --> 42:09.395
Oh and I spoke to his sister on
the phone, she said and I quote,

42:09.995 --> 42:11.597
"I'm not surprised,
he died like this."

42:11.897 --> 42:15.066
Two car crashes in the last
three years, drunk, both times.

42:17.035 --> 42:20.205
Okay, maybe, it was an accident
but only an asshole gloats.

42:24.275 --> 42:27.178
Fine, I'll go check out the car,
I'll go write up the report.

42:27.212 --> 42:29.080
And then, you're gonna buy me
a couple of shots.

43:06.284 --> 43:07.285
Shut the door.

43:14.726 --> 43:16.562
How's the new task force
working out?

43:17.829 --> 43:20.499
Uh, we are
making progress, sir.

43:22.801 --> 43:23.802
Finish your dinner.

43:24.402 --> 43:25.403
No, it's okay.

43:26.005 --> 43:28.139
You're not on the clock, I have
no right to ruin your meal.

43:33.078 --> 43:34.079
Okay.

43:38.850 --> 43:39.851
I'm just like you, Detective,

43:41.487 --> 43:42.921
our laptop is always open.

43:44.656 --> 43:45.657
Funny thing was,

43:46.792 --> 43:48.159
I was eating breakfast
this morning,

43:49.027 --> 43:50.428
reading one blog or another,

43:50.462 --> 43:52.330
then, the damn thing
started beeping.

43:52.664 --> 43:54.933
Not that you've got
the mail beep or the...

43:55.801 --> 43:58.837
some pain-in-the-ass college buddy
tweeting some bullshit news

43:58.870 --> 44:02.841
about his douchebag kid hitting
home run in little league beep.

44:05.043 --> 44:07.813
Uh, no, this was different,
this was uh,

44:08.514 --> 44:09.781
this was a federal beep.

44:11.282 --> 44:12.283
You know what that is?

44:13.852 --> 44:14.853
No.

44:15.153 --> 44:18.857
See, I can program
my computer, let me know,

44:19.390 --> 44:21.026
anytime, someone might say...

44:22.628 --> 44:26.231
Special Agent O'Leary
searches the database for someone like,

44:26.698 --> 44:28.366
say, Ethan Kelly.

44:32.037 --> 44:34.506
And that was the beep
I heard this morning

44:34.540 --> 44:37.408
as I was pouring my second bowl of
Honey Nut Cheerios.

44:38.544 --> 44:39.545
Why do you suppose

44:39.746 --> 44:42.748
Special Agent O'Leary
would be interested in Ethan Kelly?

44:44.750 --> 44:46.084
You know, I don't know.

44:46.452 --> 44:47.453
I didn't either.

44:49.388 --> 44:50.389
So, I asked him.

44:52.391 --> 44:53.392
You know what he said?

44:54.960 --> 44:56.428
He said he'd never heard
of Ethan Kelly.

44:57.463 --> 44:58.464
And I believed him.

45:00.599 --> 45:02.734
So, we put our heads together
and we figured

45:04.202 --> 45:09.501
somebody in the task force must have used
his computer when he wasn't around.

45:09.536 --> 45:10.409
Mmh.

45:11.142 --> 45:12.143
Long story short...

45:14.312 --> 45:15.313
turns out that you

45:17.449 --> 45:19.951
are the only person
in that task force

45:19.985 --> 45:22.588
with any connection,
whatsoever to Kelly.

45:23.288 --> 45:27.292
No sign from a transgression
here or there.

45:29.661 --> 45:31.329
You've been
a pretty good cop, Finnelly.

45:31.830 --> 45:32.831
So I figured,

45:33.164 --> 45:35.066
someone with less than
honorable motives

45:35.100 --> 45:37.035
must have asked you
to violate procedure.

45:39.204 --> 45:40.271
Perhaps, it was

45:41.339 --> 45:42.340
Grace Travis?

45:56.387 --> 45:57.388
Last chance, Finnelly.

46:00.659 --> 46:03.361
She asked me to do her a favor.

46:03.895 --> 46:05.196
And you're her good friend?

46:05.463 --> 46:07.365
I didn't know
why she wanted it.

46:08.299 --> 46:09.300
Where is she now?

46:10.068 --> 46:11.369
Is she in Chicago?

46:14.806 --> 46:16.542
Is she in Chicago?

46:18.877 --> 46:19.878
I think so.

46:25.383 --> 46:27.686
We should all have friends
like you, Detective.

46:41.933 --> 46:43.501
- Howard.
- General Howard?

46:43.769 --> 46:44.903
It's me.

46:44.936 --> 46:46.504
Grace Travis
is heading your way.

46:53.779 --> 46:54.780
It's right over there.

46:55.246 --> 46:56.682
- This one?
- Yeah.

46:57.115 --> 46:58.717
Hey, don't you need a warrant
or something?

46:59.217 --> 47:00.752
Mr. Hutchings is deceased.

47:01.086 --> 47:02.888
Explains the 14 unpaids.

47:04.590 --> 47:05.691
I can take it from here.

47:07.358 --> 47:08.393
Suit yourself.

47:09.561 --> 47:10.762
Fucking cold out anyway.

47:11.630 --> 47:13.031
Who wants to be out here.

48:00.311 --> 48:01.312
What the fuck!
