WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:01.490
Previously on Life Unexpected

00:01.640 --> 00:03.440
I'm looking for Nathaniel Bazile.

00:03.440 --> 00:04.290
That's me.

00:04.290 --> 00:05.140
I'm your daughter.

00:05.140 --> 00:07.500
You and someone had a kid.

00:07.500 --> 00:08.820
You gave up that kid.

00:08.820 --> 00:10.020
I am that kid.

00:10.020 --> 00:11.850
And now I'm applying for emancipation.

00:12.430 --> 00:13.630
Cate Cassidy--that's your mom.

00:13.630 --> 00:14.660
I am Cate Cassidy.

00:14.660 --> 00:16.890
Ryan has been up since 5

00:16.890 --> 00:19.260
and that's usual arguing since  6

00:19.260 --> 00:20.170
What are you doing here?

00:20.170 --> 00:22.570
Uh, they're, um, my birth parents.

00:22.570 --> 00:24.900
I am not granting you emancipation.

00:24.900 --> 00:25.750
I'm releasing you

00:25.750 --> 00:28.960
back into their temporary joint custody.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.010
We're letting you go.

00:30.510 --> 00:31.590
Go where?

00:31.840 --> 00:33.110
We're firing you.

00:33.110 --> 00:34.550
Ryan and Kelly debut tomorrow.

00:34.550 --> 00:35.990
Will you marry me?

00:36.510 --> 00:38.830
So before you end up in something that's hard to get out of,

00:38.830 --> 00:40.390
make sure you want to be there.

00:40.390 --> 00:41.860
I needed this.

00:46.070 --> 00:48.670
I can't promise you forever.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.370
Paige, Baze.

00:58.530 --> 00:59.990
Hey, do you smell that?

00:59.990 --> 01:01.590
Is... is that smoke?

01:01.590 --> 01:02.850
Is it the bar?

01:04.680 --> 01:07.080
- Paige. - Hey, Cate!

01:07.080 --> 01:08.640
Is Ryan here?

01:08.640 --> 01:11.490
No. your brother's still at the station.

01:11.490 --> 01:13.720
You've met Mr. Daniels.

01:14.760 --> 01:15.410
You're a...

01:15.410 --> 01:16.420
Teacher.

02:03.930 --> 02:04.820
With something new--

02:04.820 --> 02:07.100
it's the Morning Minus The Madness

02:07.100 --> 02:08.050
with Ryan Thomas,

02:08.050 --> 02:10.990
and introducing his new cohost, Kelly Campbell!

02:10.990 --> 02:12.380
Hey! look at you

02:12.380 --> 02:14.600
Being all domestic! wow!

02:14.600 --> 02:16.410
And what are you doing up so early?

02:16.410 --> 02:18.060
Isn't one of the upsides of getting canned

02:18.060 --> 02:19.240
that you can sleep till noon?

02:19.240 --> 02:21.360
Yeah. I have a meeting with my agent.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.610
And we've got Bruce on the line.

02:22.610 --> 02:23.590
What do you got, Bruce?

02:23.590 --> 02:25.910
Ryan, got to say, you traded up.

02:25.910 --> 02:27.370
- Kelly's a hoot. - You know what?

02:27.370 --> 02:28.920
Maybe I should just pretend to be a virgin.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.340
I mean, that seems to be all the rage.

02:30.340 --> 02:32.530
Well, every time I pretend, guys think it's hot.

02:34.690 --> 02:37.140
Ah, would you look at you-- in a dress!

02:37.140 --> 02:39.330
Everything was dirty.

02:39.330 --> 02:40.410
Nice boots.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.020
Hey, Aunt Paige.

02:42.590 --> 02:44.540
What? she asked me to call her that.

02:45.870 --> 02:47.280
That's my ride; got to go.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.200
No, no, but I'm making breakfast.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.700
Hey, if you're leaving,

02:50.700 --> 02:51.810
I'm crashing in your room.

02:51.810 --> 02:53.590
That couch is giving me spina bifida.

02:56.090 --> 02:57.170
At least she likes your cooking.

02:57.170 --> 02:58.040
Yeah.

02:59.020 --> 03:00.440
You okay?

03:00.440 --> 03:01.690
Why, with Aunt Paige?

03:01.690 --> 03:02.770
Yeah, absolutely.

03:02.770 --> 03:05.330
I mean, you know, if I ever need to borrow a balinese tunic

03:05.330 --> 03:08.570
I can just... pluck one off the couch.

03:08.570 --> 03:09.850
No, I mean, about Ryan being at work

03:09.850 --> 03:11.360
and you kind of... not.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.220
Yeah, totally.

03:12.220 --> 03:13.380
It's fine.

03:13.380 --> 03:14.380
And how about you,

03:14.380 --> 03:16.230
how are you doing about Bug leaving?

03:16.230 --> 03:17.260
Totally fine.

03:17.270 --> 03:19.100
You know, it's about time that I...

03:19.100 --> 03:20.820
see what else is out there, right?

03:20.900 --> 03:22.170
I bet you that there is something better

03:22.170 --> 03:24.150
right around the corner for both of us.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.180
Hey, I honked.

03:29.180 --> 03:29.870
You ready?

03:29.870 --> 03:31.570
Oh. yeah, sorry.

03:31.570 --> 03:33.000
And what are you doing up so early?

03:33.000 --> 03:34.250
I thought you got...

03:34.250 --> 03:36.890
Fired. yes, yes, I did,

03:36.890 --> 03:38.240
Thank you so much for the reminder.

03:38.240 --> 03:39.100
So you got drunk

03:39.100 --> 03:40.220
and trashed your place, huh?

03:40.220 --> 03:41.230
I've been there.

03:41.230 --> 03:42.070
No, Ryan's sister

03:42.070 --> 03:43.300
is staying with us.

03:43.300 --> 03:45.580
I'm picturing Ryan in a dress.

03:45.580 --> 03:46.740
Doesn't do it for me.

03:46.740 --> 03:47.680
That's good.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.270
Okay, so go.

03:49.770 --> 03:50.580
Hi!

03:50.580 --> 03:52.010
Hi. good morning. How are you?

03:52.010 --> 03:53.470
Did you sleep well?

03:53.470 --> 03:54.880
- Yes, you okay? - Good.

04:11.010 --> 04:12.190
So, what's with the tie?

04:12.190 --> 04:13.020
I haven't seen you this

04:13.020 --> 04:14.840
Dressed up since my adoption.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.550
What, are we getting another kid?

04:17.380 --> 04:19.089
More like another job.

04:19.089 --> 04:19.970
Until the insurance comes

04:19.970 --> 04:21.430
Through, the bar is closed.

04:21.430 --> 04:23.090
Which means no income.

04:23.090 --> 04:24.980
So, my dad, uh,

04:24.980 --> 04:26.210
Got me an interview

04:26.210 --> 04:27.700
At his wealth management firm today.

04:27.700 --> 04:28.580
I'm trying to picture you

04:28.580 --> 04:30.450
Behind a desk and not a bar.

04:30.450 --> 04:31.320
It's kind of weird.

04:31.320 --> 04:32.360
I know.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.210
But it could be good, yeah?

04:35.120 --> 04:36.820
All right, so what's your excuse?

04:36.820 --> 04:38.200
Who'd you dress up for?

04:38.200 --> 04:39.870
Is it Jones? I like jones.

04:39.870 --> 04:41.150
No. in case you haven't noticed,

04:41.150 --> 04:43.360
I'm not exactly the quarterback type.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.580
Well, I was a quarterback,

04:44.580 --> 04:45.630
And trust me,

04:45.630 --> 04:46.790
We didn't have a type.

04:46.790 --> 04:48.730
"girl" pretty much covered it.

04:48.730 --> 04:50.290
Jones dates head cheerleaders,

04:50.290 --> 04:51.890
Not girls who've only

04:51.890 --> 04:53.890
Been to the dentist twice.

04:53.890 --> 04:55.610
Well, after today, you're

04:55.610 --> 04:57.020
Gonna have a daddy who takes time in an office

04:57.020 --> 04:58.310
And a mom who stays home

04:58.310 --> 04:59.910
Sniffing cleaning products.

04:59.910 --> 05:01.740
You can't get more normal.

05:01.740 --> 05:02.880
And we are going to work

05:02.880 --> 05:04.670
On that dentist situation.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.220
All right, kiddo,

05:08.220 --> 05:09.840
Whoever you're all pretty for,

05:09.840 --> 05:11.140
He's one lucky kid.

05:20.460 --> 05:21.310
Did you know that you have

05:21.310 --> 05:23.150
A beer stain on your tie?

05:30.240 --> 05:31.380
Uh, sorry.

05:31.380 --> 05:32.510
I was... I was just...

05:32.510 --> 05:33.220
It's okay.

05:33.220 --> 05:34.390
I thought that I locked it.

05:35.320 --> 05:36.630
I'm just crashing at a buddy's place

05:36.630 --> 05:38.040
Until I find an apartment.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.980
His couch is a little short on closet space, so...

05:43.370 --> 05:44.630
What's up?

05:44.630 --> 05:46.300
Uh, nothing.

05:47.580 --> 05:48.890
I-I mean, nothing,

05:48.890 --> 05:50.290
I just thought maybe We should talk about

05:50.290 --> 05:51.520
What happened the other night.

05:52.390 --> 05:53.490
English one.

05:53.490 --> 05:54.730
Sample syllabus.

05:54.730 --> 05:55.660
Thank you.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.500
- Lux, hey.  - Hey.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.760
You know you're in the Wrong classroom, right?

05:59.760 --> 06:01.030
I'm next-door.

06:01.030 --> 06:03.220
Yes. i-i was just asking

06:03.220 --> 06:04.740
Mr. Daniels if he has

06:04.740 --> 06:07.310
An extra copy of Great Expectations laying around?

06:07.400 --> 06:08.310
Lux...

06:08.980 --> 06:11.150
You got to be more careful next time.

06:12.420 --> 06:14.210
Second time that's happened.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.700
Read it, learn it, love it.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.280
Got it.

06:18.280 --> 06:19.890
It's the entire midterm.

06:27.390 --> 06:28.680
You coming to class?

06:30.340 --> 06:31.360
Yeah.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.970
You know, i'm-i'm actually really excited about this.

06:38.970 --> 06:40.090
I mean, I would have never

06:40.090 --> 06:41.910
Left the show on my own, but...

06:41.910 --> 06:42.730
I don't know,

06:42.730 --> 06:43.650
This is good, you know?

06:43.650 --> 06:45.480
I'm just really... I'm ready

06:45.480 --> 06:46.740
To get people excited

06:46.740 --> 06:48.860
About being in the cate cassidy business.

06:48.860 --> 06:51.940
Public radio Seattle is interested.

06:51.940 --> 06:53.410
Okay, so why don't we just start

06:53.410 --> 06:55.940
With the, uh, best option first?

06:56.690 --> 06:57.920
Public Radio Seattle

06:57.920 --> 06:59.060
Is very, very interested.

06:59.060 --> 07:00.240
I don't live in seattle.

07:00.240 --> 07:00.860
I know.

07:00.860 --> 07:02.370
What about Y109?

07:02.370 --> 07:03.970
I heard that they have an opening.

07:03.970 --> 07:05.510
I have feelers out.

07:05.510 --> 07:07.680
Everyone I talk to loves you.

07:07.680 --> 07:08.920
They think you're great.

07:10.020 --> 07:11.680
The problem is,

07:11.680 --> 07:13.850
You've always been... Cate

07:13.850 --> 07:15.410
Of Cate and Ryan.

07:15.410 --> 07:16.130
Alone, you're a little

07:16.130 --> 07:17.600
Tougher sell-- not impossible.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.970
In fact, I do have something.

07:20.330 --> 07:22.760
How would you like to produce

07:22.760 --> 07:24.440
The Ryan and Kelly show?

07:26.090 --> 07:27.150
What?

07:27.150 --> 07:28.590
I know what you're thinking.

07:28.590 --> 07:30.730
"No way! Cate Cassidy is on-air talent!"

07:30.730 --> 07:31.760
But hear me out.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.760
It's local. okay?

07:33.760 --> 07:36.020
It's a small step towards getting

07:36.020 --> 07:37.120
you on the radio.

07:37.120 --> 07:37.880
I was on the radio.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.200
Not with your own show.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.520
And... I played hardball.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.320
There is a deal on the table...

07:45.760 --> 07:48.370
just to start immediately at almost your full salary.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.510
No.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.230
No?

07:52.400 --> 07:53.340
No.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.010
Alan... hm?

07:55.010 --> 07:56.890
You're my agent.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.550
I don't know what other jobs are out there,

07:59.550 --> 08:00.870
but you need to find me one.

08:00.870 --> 08:02.340
That's not producing a show,

08:02.340 --> 08:03.580
that I was fired from

08:03.580 --> 08:04.960
for less money.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.600
Okay, that's a huge step back.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.450
Honey, think about it.

08:08.450 --> 08:10.000
You started in producing--

08:10.000 --> 08:11.310
you're going back to your roots!

08:11.310 --> 08:12.960
Is it ideal? No.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.160
But when Ryan suggested it...

08:14.160 --> 08:16.540
Wait, what? Ryan suggested it?

08:16.540 --> 08:17.990
He didn't tell you?

08:24.750 --> 08:25.790
Hello?

08:25.790 --> 08:27.110
Is everything Okay?

08:27.110 --> 08:28.570
Right. Because that's why parents get called

08:28.570 --> 08:29.490
to the principal's office,

08:29.490 --> 08:31.110
because everything is Okay.

08:32.230 --> 08:33.000
Oh, geez. Is this about

08:33.000 --> 08:34.860
the number of times she's been tardy?

08:34.860 --> 08:36.390
Because that is his fault.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.289
Or is it about Lux being genetically moody?

08:38.289 --> 08:39.950
Because that is all Cate.

08:39.950 --> 08:42.440
I'm afraid it's a bit more serious than that.

08:42.440 --> 08:45.910
Your daughter is failing out of Westmonte.

09:12.780 --> 09:14.000
You know, I-I don't understand.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.410
I mean, if she is failing,

09:15.410 --> 09:16.950
why didn't we hear about this before today?

09:16.950 --> 09:18.570
Someone from the school should have called

09:18.570 --> 09:20.120
or sent home a note.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.810
The school policy clearly states

09:21.810 --> 09:24.330
that any student who is potentially failing

09:24.330 --> 09:26.200
must have all exams signed

09:26.200 --> 09:28.060
by a parent, and Lux's were.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.870
Yeah. well, there was just a lot going on,

09:30.870 --> 09:32.710
And I didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

09:32.710 --> 09:35.660
Lux, failing is a huge deal.

09:35.660 --> 09:39.110
It's not... simply an issue of grades.

09:39.110 --> 09:41.800
It's that Lux's work has not shown improvement

09:41.800 --> 09:43.390
since she arrived here.

09:43.390 --> 09:44.710
What do we need to do?

09:44.710 --> 09:45.860
She needs to pass

09:45.860 --> 09:47.620
if she's gonna stay at Westmonte.

09:47.620 --> 09:50.010
Otherwise, there are other schools

09:50.010 --> 09:52.430
in the neighborhood that, uh...

09:52.430 --> 09:54.450
perhaps operate at a slower pace.

09:54.450 --> 09:56.320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop,

09:56.320 --> 09:57.180
Hold on a second.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.460
We're not gonna ship Lux off

09:58.460 --> 10:00.450
to some, you know, short-bus remedial school.

10:00.450 --> 10:02.270
Exactly, right? Because if Baze

10:02.270 --> 10:03.230
can pass Westmonte,

10:03.230 --> 10:04.590
So can she.

10:04.590 --> 10:06.990
Her lowest grade is in English.

10:06.990 --> 10:10.270
If Lux has a prayer of scraping by

10:10.270 --> 10:12.170
with a C for the semester,

10:12.170 --> 10:14.150
she needs to get an A

10:14.150 --> 10:15.580
on this Thursday's midterm.

10:15.580 --> 10:17.020
Consider it done!

10:17.020 --> 10:17.830
Cate!

10:17.830 --> 10:18.800
Lux, maybe

10:18.800 --> 10:20.720
I could speak with your parents for a moment.

10:26.300 --> 10:27.660
Okay.

10:28.380 --> 10:31.610
These problems often boil down to motivation.

10:31.610 --> 10:33.550
When parents get involved at school,

10:33.550 --> 10:34.580
kids get motivated.

10:34.580 --> 10:39.490
Aside from you visiting here after the bong lamp incident...

10:39.490 --> 10:40.690
- Oh, that was my bad.  - It was his fault.

10:40.690 --> 10:42.390
...and, of course, the chaperoning

10:42.390 --> 10:44.450
of the winter formal...

10:44.590 --> 10:46.220
You haven't done much.

10:46.220 --> 10:47.990
Well, you know what, if you ever need me to throw together,

10:47.990 --> 10:49.630
like, a quick, you know, like a

10:49.630 --> 10:51.440
donkey basketbashe's the...

10:51.440 --> 10:52.770
- I'm your guy.  - He really is.

10:52.770 --> 10:54.880
And cate, she can make cookies for the bake sale.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.350
Or buy them.

10:56.450 --> 10:58.010
I could buy them.

10:58.010 --> 11:00.200
Actually, there is something we could really use.

11:00.850 --> 11:03.530
We need another speaker at career day tomorrow.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.020
You could talk about your successes.

11:05.020 --> 11:08.810
You're a radio deejay, you started your own business.

11:08.810 --> 11:10.260
It could also show Lux

11:10.260 --> 11:12.820
that you have high expectations for her, as well.

11:12.820 --> 11:14.230
There's a bit of a problem there,

11:14.230 --> 11:15.280
because, see, I'm a little bit

11:15.280 --> 11:16.290
between careers right now,

11:16.290 --> 11:17.410
And this one-- she's the...

11:17.410 --> 11:19.190
she's the public speaker of the family.

11:19.190 --> 11:20.610
She just got can...

11:20.610 --> 11:21.840
...cer.

11:23.240 --> 11:24.960
Cancer.

11:26.410 --> 11:27.940
I thought it was cancer.

11:27.940 --> 11:31.410
But it was more like this 24-hour bug kind of thing.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.270
So, um...

11:35.960 --> 11:37.960
Career day it is, huh?

11:39.190 --> 11:41.260
Career day? you couldn't have jumped on bake sale?

11:41.260 --> 11:42.460
Yeah. Well, you want to go back in there

11:42.460 --> 11:44.730
and tell principal Dugan that neither one of us can speak

11:44.730 --> 11:46.330
Because we're both unemployed losers?

11:47.260 --> 11:48.390
I'm not the one who got fired.

11:48.390 --> 11:50.390
No, you just burned down your own bar!

11:50.390 --> 11:51.390
Hey, guys? yeah.

11:51.390 --> 11:52.560
This is no reason to start fighting.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.190
We're not fighting. We're discussing.

11:54.190 --> 11:55.350
It's just grades.

11:55.350 --> 11:57.940
Yeah, which could affect your admission to college.

11:57.940 --> 11:59.690
Who said I wanted to go to college?

12:00.870 --> 12:02.820
How else do you expect to have a career?

12:02.820 --> 12:03.930
Well, you and Baze went to college,

12:03.930 --> 12:04.940
and you don't even have jobs.

12:04.940 --> 12:05.700
Yes, at the moment.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.040
I already have an entire career

12:07.040 --> 12:08.690
under my belt, and Baze...

12:10.390 --> 12:11.650
Not a good example.

12:11.650 --> 12:12.790
I happen to have an interview

12:15.300 --> 12:17.090
In 20 minutes. I got to go.

12:17.090 --> 12:19.580
Guys, this whole career day thing really isn't necessary.

12:19.580 --> 12:21.270
Um, yes, it is.

12:21.270 --> 12:23.530
We need to be involved, okay?

12:23.530 --> 12:25.020
You let us handle that.

12:25.020 --> 12:28.820
You... you just get ready to study for your exam.

12:28.820 --> 12:30.450
Okay, when we get home,

12:30.450 --> 12:32.300
We're going to come up with a study plan.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.130
That's going to make learning fun.

12:34.130 --> 12:37.130
Anyone can get A's in high school if they try.

12:38.700 --> 12:40.430
Did you get a's in high school?

12:40.430 --> 12:42.210
Sometimes, you know, with the answers on my shoe.

12:42.210 --> 12:43.140
Hmm. Got to go.

12:43.140 --> 12:45.110
- Hey, wish me luck. - luck!

12:45.110 --> 12:47.190
Okay, don't worry about it.

12:47.190 --> 12:48.520
You're my kid.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.710
You have got academic success in your blood,

12:50.710 --> 12:52.520
Which hopefully,

12:52.520 --> 12:55.310
isn't gonna counteract the dumb-ass you got from Baze.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.370
Well, when am I going to get a check?

13:02.370 --> 13:04.420
I filled out that insurance claim

13:04.420 --> 13:05.710
with everything I remember.

13:05.710 --> 13:07.190
Who?

13:07.190 --> 13:09.330
Yeah. Fire girl.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.690
I don't know. Paige something.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.750
I didn't get her last name.

13:12.750 --> 13:16.060
How many Paiges are there in this city?

13:18.690 --> 13:21.180
After six boilermakers, it's all a little blurry.

13:21.180 --> 13:23.180
So, as far as a description goes,

13:23.180 --> 13:26.180
Um, crazy in bed and burned down my bar

13:26.180 --> 13:27.790
is all that I've got.

13:29.260 --> 13:31.620
Look, I pay my premiums, all right,

13:31.620 --> 13:34.880
or at least my dad does, so, really, all I need is a check.

13:44.100 --> 13:46.390
Hi. I'm, uh, Nate Bazile.

13:46.390 --> 13:47.820
Here to see Emma Bradshaw.

13:47.820 --> 13:49.210
I'm Emma.

13:50.210 --> 13:51.920
You're late.

13:54.220 --> 13:58.030
So I see you're making a rather significant career change.

13:58.030 --> 13:59.710
- Why now? - Well, you know, I've been

13:59.710 --> 14:00.960
doing my own thing for a while

14:00.960 --> 14:03.180
and I feel like it's time to branch out, grow up,

14:03.180 --> 14:05.970
move away from an industry that involves beer nuts.

14:05.970 --> 14:06.880
And what makes you think

14:06.880 --> 14:08.930
you'd be a good fit at fenmore financial?

14:08.930 --> 14:11.380
Same last name as the guy who runs the place...

14:12.980 --> 14:13.710
You know what, though?

14:13.710 --> 14:15.300
I don't want you to take that into consideration.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.130
Because, yes, my father got me in the door,

14:17.140 --> 14:18.240
but I want you

14:18.240 --> 14:21.330
to judge me based on, you know, my own merits.

14:21.810 --> 14:23.100
So, you ran a bar?

14:23.100 --> 14:24.660
Yes, I did, until it,

14:24.660 --> 14:26.910
Um... was disposed of...

14:26.910 --> 14:28.990
Right. Paige something.

14:28.990 --> 14:30.320
Yeah, it's the... this?

14:32.810 --> 14:35.720
Do you, um... do you habitually sleep with girls

14:35.720 --> 14:37.020
without asking their last name?

14:37.020 --> 14:38.470
Uh, she was a new bartender.

14:38.470 --> 14:40.200
I was in a little bit of a head space, so...

14:40.200 --> 14:42.080
Ah. so, you slept with an employee?

14:43.380 --> 14:44.990
Could we just start this over?

14:44.990 --> 14:46.830
Oh, I think we should.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.580
Um, would I be correct in that you're 32,

14:49.580 --> 14:51.770
And this would be your first real job?

14:55.090 --> 14:57.880
You-you know my dad owns this company, right?

15:02.270 --> 15:04.240
Okay, so I've made us some flash cards

15:04.240 --> 15:05.090
for your midterms.

15:05.090 --> 15:07.010
They are broken down by plot, character,

15:07.010 --> 15:08.840
theme and subtext.

15:08.840 --> 15:11.260
Hmm. It's, like, 100 cards.

15:11.260 --> 15:13.430
No, don't think of it as 100 cards.

15:13.430 --> 15:17.780
Think of it as tiny, memorizable pieces.

15:18.480 --> 15:19.450
Okay, okay.

15:19.450 --> 15:23.160
I get that this is important, and I'll try, but...

15:23.160 --> 15:24.960
Cate, I'm not like you.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.680
I'm not... I'm not smart.

15:29.640 --> 15:31.350
You are smart.

15:31.350 --> 15:33.080
Hidden underneath all of those hats

15:33.080 --> 15:34.450
and those scarves and those layers,

15:34.450 --> 15:36.760
there is a ton of smartness.

15:36.860 --> 15:38.360
I'm gonna find it.

15:39.140 --> 15:41.240
Hey, I'm home. Oh, hey.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.260
Sorry I'm late.

15:42.990 --> 15:45.810
Kelly and I had to suffer through dinner with corporate.

15:45.810 --> 15:47.920
But I did pick up some dessert. Hmm.

15:47.920 --> 15:51.070
Hey, Ryan, we're in the middle of studying, so...

15:51.070 --> 15:52.860
Okay, well, how about this?

15:52.860 --> 15:55.310
You two haven't seen each other all day,  go

15:55.310 --> 15:57.290
so I will to baze's and study, huh?

16:01.500 --> 16:02.970
Okay, well, then, um,

16:02.970 --> 16:04.890
Why don't you just take the practice test...

16:04.890 --> 16:06.310
Uh-huh. ...that I made you?

16:06.310 --> 16:09.070
- And listen to the study guide... - Got it.

16:09.070 --> 16:10.320
You know, I used to

16:10.320 --> 16:12.640
Study listening to music.

16:12.640 --> 16:13.680
'cause Mozart...

16:13.680 --> 16:15.210
Mozart makes you smarter.

16:15.210 --> 16:17.750
Rage against the machine-- now that keeps you awake.

16:17.750 --> 16:20.880
Okay, Ryan, I have been doing this with her all day.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.150
I've got it.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.700
Thank you.

16:26.740 --> 16:28.740
Yeah. See you.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.880
Well, what? I was just trying to help.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.310
Okay, well, if scoring me a demotion

16:33.310 --> 16:36.920
At the place that fired me is your idea of helping, don't.

16:58.850 --> 17:01.270
This place is awesome.

17:05.369 --> 17:06.930
This is definitely a step up

17:06.930 --> 17:08.140
from living in my classroom

17:08.609 --> 17:10.630
Why would someone leave this place?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.280
Jamie worked at the bar.

17:12.280 --> 17:13.800
After the fire, he was broke,

17:13.800 --> 17:15.180
so he moved back home with his mom.

17:15.180 --> 17:16.750
But she's cool.

17:16.750 --> 17:17.920
If you want it, you'd just need

17:17.920 --> 17:19.660
To meet with baze, too. it's his place.

17:19.660 --> 17:21.810
Hell, yeah, I want it. this is perfect.

17:21.810 --> 17:23.079
Hey, lux?

17:23.690 --> 17:25.619
You know when baze is getting back?

17:28.030 --> 17:29.750
You live here?

17:29.750 --> 17:31.340
Not really. no.

17:31.340 --> 17:33.450
Sometimes, but... but barely.

17:33.450 --> 17:35.660
Barely. Barely at all.

17:39.890 --> 17:41.410
You know what?

17:41.410 --> 17:43.130
I should probably think about this.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.430
I'll give you a call.

17:47.430 --> 17:49.020
What just happened?

17:52.490 --> 17:53.840
Well, Eric!

17:53.840 --> 17:57.000
Lux, you can't call me that.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.150
Okay, dude, you can take the room if you want it.

17:59.150 --> 18:01.450
Why... why are you acting like you did something wrong?

18:01.450 --> 18:02.500
Okay, because I did.

18:02.500 --> 18:03.810
Do you have any idea how much trouble

18:03.810 --> 18:05.660
I'd get in if anyone found out?

18:05.660 --> 18:07.060
Anything.

18:07.060 --> 18:08.270
I'd lose my job...

18:08.270 --> 18:09.710
all right, like I'm gonna say anything.

18:09.710 --> 18:11.340
Okay, and you're, like, two seconds older than me,

18:11.340 --> 18:12.520
So stop freaking out.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.000
Try six years, lux.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.160
I'm 23. you're what, 17?

18:17.270 --> 18:18.730
Sixteen.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.240
Even better.

18:20.240 --> 18:21.780
Look, I get it.

18:21.780 --> 18:22.990
Nothing can happen between us,

18:22.990 --> 18:26.620
But we still felt what we felt, right?

18:29.690 --> 18:31.280
I...

18:31.730 --> 18:33.370
I mean, didn't you?

18:35.050 --> 18:38.230
Feel something? That's why you don't want to move in.

18:42.420 --> 18:44.610
What happened with us was a mistake.

18:46.310 --> 18:48.250
I didn't feel anything.

18:50.850 --> 18:54.120
Well, then I guess nothing's stopping you.

19:20.010 --> 19:23.100
Hey, save your cereal milk.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.080
We're gonna have to start

19:24.080 --> 19:25.700
Cutting some corners around here.

19:25.700 --> 19:26.480
Why?

19:26.480 --> 19:28.930
The insurance company just called.

19:29.590 --> 19:30.920
They're not gonna cover the fire?

19:30.920 --> 19:33.100
Nope. no.

19:35.140 --> 19:36.810
Only for structural damage.

19:36.810 --> 19:37.740
But everything else

19:37.740 --> 19:39.560
Should have been covered under renters insurance,

19:39.560 --> 19:42.080
Which I, the renter,

19:42.080 --> 19:44.130
Apparently missed some payments on.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.740
Don't you scowl at me. you got a milk mustache.

19:47.740 --> 19:49.100
The effect is creepy.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.990
How can I not scowl?

19:50.990 --> 19:52.100
The bar, the insurance,

19:52.100 --> 19:54.050
The not getting a job at your dad's company.

19:54.050 --> 19:56.050
Oh, that was not my fault.

19:56.050 --> 19:58.210
That emma chick-- she totally judged me

19:58.210 --> 20:00.780
Based on a private telephone conversation.

20:00.780 --> 20:02.650
Which you were having in a public elevator.

20:02.650 --> 20:04.060
You know what?

20:04.060 --> 20:06.190
I didn't want that job.

20:06.190 --> 20:07.280
I'm not a desk guy.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.690
I mean, even the parking structure made me nervous.

20:09.690 --> 20:12.390
Who-who wants to stand around with a bunch of stuffy suits

20:12.390 --> 20:13.920
Talking about money all day?

20:13.920 --> 20:16.150
This is just like in high school when we played carter.

20:20.440 --> 20:22.560
We're gonna do the carter story again, really?

20:22.560 --> 20:24.330
You psyched yourself out, and you didn't even try.

20:24.330 --> 20:25.940
Well, I tried to get this job, all right?

20:25.940 --> 20:27.970
She didn't even give me a chance.

20:27.970 --> 20:30.170
Then make her give you a chance.

20:30.170 --> 20:32.250
You built your bar from the wall studs up.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.980
You-you ran a small business for years.

20:34.980 --> 20:38.960
Baze, you majored in economics in college.

20:41.150 --> 20:43.760
You need this job, and you need to stop telling yourself

20:43.760 --> 20:45.860
The game is lost before you even start.

20:54.960 --> 20:55.800
And, of course,

20:55.800 --> 20:59.770
I've had to consider a number of offers already.

20:59.770 --> 21:01.220
Seattle wants me.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.070
Uh, San Diego--

21:03.070 --> 21:04.190
They want me, too.

21:04.190 --> 21:06.310
And everybody at Y109 loves you.

21:06.310 --> 21:07.630
Loves you!

21:07.630 --> 21:10.590
That is just so good to hear. You have no idea.

21:10.590 --> 21:12.180
I mean, really, I think that leaving

21:12.180 --> 21:15.210
K-100 might be the best thing that has ever happened to me.

21:15.210 --> 21:16.810
Their loss is our gain.

21:16.810 --> 21:18.230
Cate Cassidy as a solo act

21:18.230 --> 21:19.960
has a whole rogue woman thing going on.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.040
Which is so timely.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.100
- Yes.  - We think it would be a big hit in the

21:23.100 --> 21:25.000
2 a.m.to 6 a.m. slot.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.410
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.680
Um... I thought

21:28.680 --> 21:30.740
that the open slot was morning drive time.

21:30.740 --> 21:33.140
Well, drive time is more of a two-hander.

21:33.140 --> 21:35.400
Listeners love the banter, the chemistry.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.420
Like you had with Ryan,

21:36.430 --> 21:37.650
or Ryan has with Kelly.

21:37.650 --> 21:39.110
Oh, love Ryan and Kelly.

21:39.110 --> 21:40.660
Yeah, they're great.

21:40.660 --> 21:43.390
Um, look,

21:43.390 --> 21:45.540
I have been hosting morning drive time

21:45.540 --> 21:46.880
for the past three years.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.520
It is true that I don't have a lot of tape on my own,

21:49.520 --> 21:51.700
But I do... I do have fans.

21:51.700 --> 21:53.040
You know, lots of 'em. You...

21:53.040 --> 21:55.330
- You love me. - Love you.

21:55.330 --> 21:58.510
Thing is, without Ryan, you're an unknown commodity.

21:58.510 --> 22:00.310
we have to go to bed

22:00.310 --> 22:01.780
for you to 2 to 6 a.m. slot.

22:05.900 --> 22:08.720
Okay. well, then, I will just think about it,

22:08.720 --> 22:10.230
And I will get back to you.

22:10.390 --> 22:13.500
- We'd love that. - Love that. Really.

22:27.430 --> 22:29.310
What the heck? Emma.

22:29.310 --> 22:31.430
Nate Bazile. We met the other day.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.280
Who knew we were members of the same gym?

22:34.280 --> 22:35.820
That's crazy, huh?

22:35.820 --> 22:37.870
It's like we could have run into each other over 100 times

22:37.870 --> 22:39.360
and never even noticed.

22:39.360 --> 22:40.530
It's a small world.

22:40.530 --> 22:42.700
It's an all-women's gym.

22:48.260 --> 22:50.310
Hey. All right, you know what?

22:50.310 --> 22:52.200
I think you've got the wrong impression of me.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.800
You're a woman?

22:53.800 --> 22:55.580
No. I mean, I never got the chance to tell you

22:55.580 --> 22:57.470
how I built my bar from the ground up,

22:57.470 --> 22:59.220
that I am great with the public,

22:59.220 --> 23:01.560
drumming up business, working with clientele...

23:01.560 --> 23:02.480
Really?

23:03.010 --> 23:06.270
But which of our clients do you see yourself working with?

23:06.790 --> 23:07.780
Many.

23:07.930 --> 23:09.840
Aaron Peters, Thornton Howard?

23:09.840 --> 23:11.300
Yeah. Really great guys.

23:11.300 --> 23:13.140
Solid. Love those guys.

23:13.140 --> 23:14.660
They're companies.

23:14.660 --> 23:17.070
Well, the first thing they should do is change their names

23:17.070 --> 23:18.840
to something a little more professional-sounding.

23:19.090 --> 23:20.380
You know, I don't think

23:20.380 --> 23:22.650
I got the wrong impression of you at all.

23:22.650 --> 23:26.180
I think you showed up to a job intererview

23:26.180 --> 23:27.980
underdressed and unprepared.

23:27.980 --> 23:29.980
Your resume is a joke.

23:29.980 --> 23:31.160
Do you even want the job?

23:31.160 --> 23:32.330
Oh, I think that showing up

23:32.330 --> 23:34.530
at an all-women's gym pretty much speaks for itself.

23:34.530 --> 23:36.400
I don't mean, do you want to pay your bills

23:36.400 --> 23:37.550
or get your bar back?

23:37.550 --> 23:40.750
I mean, do you want to put on a suit and tie,

23:40.750 --> 23:42.390
analyze financial reports,

23:42.390 --> 23:43.980
and sit in an office all day?

23:43.980 --> 23:45.860
Because that's what the job is.

23:45.860 --> 23:47.140
And as far as I can tell,

23:47.140 --> 23:48.780
you're just a guy who doesn't know what he wants

23:48.780 --> 23:50.850
to do with his life, so he drinks and parties

23:50.850 --> 23:53.080
and is dumb enough to burn down his own bar.

23:53.530 --> 23:54.320
Look...

23:54.480 --> 23:55.970
I don't know what you want,

23:55.970 --> 23:57.190
but I know what I want.

23:57.190 --> 23:58.690
It's not you.

24:11.110 --> 24:12.660
Was there, like, a murder in this room,

24:12.660 --> 24:15.110
and you need to destroy all evidence?

24:16.670 --> 24:18.200
Is it safe to say you didn't get the job?

24:18.200 --> 24:19.440
No, I got the job.

24:19.440 --> 24:20.440
That's awesome.

24:20.440 --> 24:22.450
Do we really have to go to this dumb career day thing?

24:22.450 --> 24:23.450
Yes.

24:23.450 --> 24:25.810
I got the 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. time slot,

24:25.810 --> 24:28.000
So I can be a miserably tired person that never has sex

24:28.000 --> 24:30.450
with her husband again, or I can just stay unemployed.

24:30.450 --> 24:32.000
Okay? Don't walk where I mopped.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.320
All right. I-I vote for the one

24:33.320 --> 24:36.510
that has nothing to do with not having sex.

24:40.010 --> 24:42.970
Or are we never having sex again, anyway?

24:42.970 --> 24:44.790
- Got it! - All right. Cate, look.

24:46.730 --> 24:48.250
Cate, I know it's hard out there,

24:48.250 --> 24:50.060
but you're going to find something great.

24:50.060 --> 24:52.240
And until then, you have a job if you want it.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.170
Yeah, the producer job

24:53.170 --> 24:54.280
- you asked them to get me?  - Yes.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.120
- Yeah, it's like pity sex. - Oh, come on.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.420
You know, just admit it. You think that working

24:57.420 --> 24:59.590
for a show that fired me is the best I can do.

24:59.590 --> 25:00.620
No, of course not.

25:00.620 --> 25:02.770
It's what you were doing before we started working together.

25:02.770 --> 25:04.740
But it's the only idea that I have

25:04.740 --> 25:06.170
that will keep us working together.

25:06.170 --> 25:07.970
Oh, really? Then why didn't you quit?

25:07.970 --> 25:10.140
Huh? Because that would have kept us together!

25:10.140 --> 25:13.070
You know, we-we could have gone to Y109,

25:13.070 --> 25:16.040
or KRKJ or any of those other places.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.240
But instead, you just sat back,

25:18.240 --> 25:19.630
and you let them replace me

25:19.630 --> 25:22.170
with-with some annoying fake virgin.

25:22.170 --> 25:24.010
No. That is not what happened, all right?

25:24.010 --> 25:24.940
I fought for you.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.720
Obviously not hard enough!

25:26.720 --> 25:28.710
Because while your career is skyrocketing,

25:28.710 --> 25:30.920
mine is in a freefall!

25:36.640 --> 25:38.900
That-that was Baze.

25:38.900 --> 25:40.930
He didn't get his job, either, so...

25:40.930 --> 25:43.090
looks like you're back

25:43.090 --> 25:45.290
to giving that career day speech.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.410
That's awesome.

26:05.210 --> 26:07.960
Because of guys like me, never again do you have to

26:07.960 --> 26:10.050
duck behind a dumpster or run off into a field.

26:10.050 --> 26:12.110
My work truly helps humanity in a time of need.

26:12.110 --> 26:13.840
I cannot believe that you are making me do this.

26:13.840 --> 26:14.650
Well, it has to be you.

26:14.650 --> 26:16.090
I'm not an inspirational speaker, Cate.

26:16.090 --> 26:17.240
Great. You made it.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.480
Which one of you is going on?

26:20.720 --> 26:22.320
I hate you.

26:24.560 --> 26:25.670
Hey, Math.

26:25.670 --> 26:26.830
That's the guy I was telling you about,

26:26.830 --> 26:27.950
who was looking at Jamie's room.

26:27.950 --> 26:29.100
Nice guy.

26:29.100 --> 26:30.450
Lux met him.

26:30.450 --> 26:31.320
Cool.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.610
Are you going to introduce us

26:32.610 --> 26:34.070
or just wait until we're fishing socks

26:34.070 --> 26:34.910
out of each other's laundry pile?

26:34.910 --> 26:36.620
No. that's what sucks. he's not taking it.

26:36.620 --> 26:37.980
Wait. What?

26:38.580 --> 26:39.520
He's not?

26:39.520 --> 26:40.920
He called back last night.

26:40.920 --> 26:41.690
Too bad,

26:41.690 --> 26:44.000
since we could really use another roommate who has a job.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.350
Pressure. Very helpful.

26:46.350 --> 26:47.610
Um, um, you know what?

26:47.610 --> 26:49.540
I left something in my locker. i'll be right back.

26:49.540 --> 26:50.880
And that's why, to me,

26:50.880 --> 26:53.630
The porta-potty service is the number one business to be in.

26:54.160 --> 26:57.100
It's also the number two business.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.780
What's the deal, mr. daniels?

27:01.780 --> 27:03.330
You're not talking to me now?

27:03.330 --> 27:05.220
Yeah, 'cause that's not childish.

27:05.220 --> 27:06.980
There's no point in talking, 'cause you don't get it.

27:06.980 --> 27:08.390
I do get that you're not taking the room

27:08.390 --> 27:09.710
in the loft because of me.

27:09.710 --> 27:11.260
Actually, I want to be closer to school.

27:11.260 --> 27:12.160
Right. So now

27:12.160 --> 27:13.970
you're a child and a liar. Got it.

27:13.970 --> 27:15.300
I'm a liar?

27:16.590 --> 27:19.380
That's ironic. You were working in a bar.

27:19.380 --> 27:21.030
You were wearing an engagement ring,

27:21.030 --> 27:23.400
talking about some guy you'd been dating for years?

27:23.400 --> 27:25.820
You were wearing a U of O t-shirt.

27:25.820 --> 27:28.010
We spent the whole night together, and you said nothing.

27:28.010 --> 27:29.260
If I'd known that you were 16--

27:29.260 --> 27:31.110
Then nothing would have happened.

27:31.910 --> 27:35.060
Eric, I am sorry.

27:35.060 --> 27:37.210
Maybe I lied because I liked you,

27:37.210 --> 27:38.660
and I didn't want you to think that I was--

27:38.660 --> 27:40.820
I was engaged and 16,

27:40.820 --> 27:42.250
like I was some screwed-up kid.

27:42.250 --> 27:43.680
Lux, look, I'm sorry.

27:43.680 --> 27:44.970
I'm not angry at you.

27:44.970 --> 27:46.200
I'm upset at the situation.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.960
This whole thing is my fault and that...

27:55.840 --> 27:56.490
You're right.

27:56.490 --> 27:58.450
Maybe we should go somewhere and talk.

28:04.470 --> 28:06.910
Thank you, Mr. Franklin.

28:08.650 --> 28:10.800
Dropped a lot of knowledge on us.

28:11.790 --> 28:13.940
Okay, people.

28:13.940 --> 28:15.720
Put your hands together

28:15.720 --> 28:19.190
for my very favorite radio host,

28:19.190 --> 28:25.120
Portland's own Cate Cassidy!

28:32.510 --> 28:34.910
I'm Cate...

28:34.910 --> 28:36.400
...uh, from, uh,

28:36.400 --> 28:38.140
From Cate and Ryan.

28:38.140 --> 28:40.800
Okay, now I am just Cate.

28:40.800 --> 28:44.340
Uh, that's "cat" with an "e."

28:44.340 --> 28:45.400
I know.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.090
And she did this for a living.

28:47.090 --> 28:48.470
Hi, guys.

28:49.210 --> 28:52.310
Hey. I'm sorry I'm late, everybody.

28:53.930 --> 28:54.980
What are you doing here?

28:54.980 --> 28:55.960
I mean, it's career day,

28:55.960 --> 28:57.560
and you're talking about our careers, so...

28:58.700 --> 29:01.150
Anybody used to listen to us on the radio, K-100?

29:02.930 --> 29:04.090
Right on.

29:04.090 --> 29:05.380
I like it.

29:05.380 --> 29:08.020
So, what you're probably thinking is,

29:08.020 --> 29:10.590
"how do you get a start in radio?"

29:10.590 --> 29:13.820
Cate, why don't you tell them how this all began,

29:13.820 --> 29:16.360
Back in our days at, uh, Z-Rock?

29:18.120 --> 29:20.140
I was a production assistant.

29:20.140 --> 29:21.170
Production assistant?

29:21.170 --> 29:22.920
Low man on the totem pole.

29:22.920 --> 29:23.670
I, on the other hand,

29:23.670 --> 29:25.990
was the host of the afternoon show.

29:25.990 --> 29:28.250
You see, Cate's main job was

29:28.250 --> 29:32.040
to bring the on-air talent coffee and doughnuts.

29:32.040 --> 29:33.630
How many times did you manage

29:33.630 --> 29:37.530
to do your job and bring me coffee and a doughnut?

29:38.640 --> 29:39.750
Zero.

29:40.030 --> 29:41.790
So, eventually, at some point,

29:41.790 --> 29:44.000
We had to ask cate point blank,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.220
"Do you even want this job?"

29:49.610 --> 29:51.480
And the answer was...

29:52.580 --> 29:54.910
Of course I didn't want the job.

29:55.630 --> 29:59.540
What I wanted, and what I've always wanted

29:59.540 --> 30:01.180
was to be on the air.

30:01.180 --> 30:02.410
So they put me on,

30:02.410 --> 30:04.990
uh... One afternoon,

30:04.990 --> 30:07.270
from the booth, to banter with Ryan.

30:07.270 --> 30:10.230
Yeah, and, oh, by the way, she-she bombed.

30:10.230 --> 30:11.520
Big time.

30:11.520 --> 30:14.290
Yes, and I realized I had a lot to learn.

30:14.290 --> 30:18.220
That instead of being so focused on where I wanted to be,

30:18.220 --> 30:20.470
I should be ready when I got there.

30:20.470 --> 30:24.090
So the next time that I got the opportunity...

30:26.080 --> 30:27.960
... I would be ready.

30:32.170 --> 30:37.150
So, a couple years later, I'm at k100,

30:37.150 --> 30:38.810
and I had the opportunity to pick a new co-host,

30:38.810 --> 30:40.790
And I remembered Cate.

30:40.790 --> 30:44.980
I remembered how she knew what she wanted,

30:44.980 --> 30:49.280
And how she wasn't afraid to fail and try again,

30:49.280 --> 30:53.170
And how she'd-she'd taken the time to just step back and learn.

30:53.170 --> 30:54.990
So I chose her.

30:56.690 --> 30:59.830
That is why I wanted to work with her then,

30:59.830 --> 31:03.300
And that is why I still do.

31:12.610 --> 31:13.790
Where's Lux?

31:13.790 --> 31:14.850
I don't know.

31:15.540 --> 31:19.080
I should have told you the truth about...

31:19.540 --> 31:21.690
Who I was.

31:22.460 --> 31:25.410
But if I had, we would have never gone to the ocean,

31:25.410 --> 31:26.880
And I would be engaged right now,

31:26.880 --> 31:31.310
Without ever knowing that there was... More.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.990
Now, I know that billboard was just a billboard,

31:35.990 --> 31:38.640
not really the ocean.

31:39.610 --> 31:41.460
and you were just a guy

31:41.460 --> 31:43.140
Who was being nice,

31:44.170 --> 31:46.470
Not a guy that actually liked me.

31:47.630 --> 31:49.530
And maybe I just...

31:50.340 --> 31:54.000
I don't know the difference anymore between what's fake and what's real.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.200
And-and that's not your fault.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.820
It's mine.

31:58.360 --> 31:59.970
I'm just...

32:01.270 --> 32:04.990
I'm trying to be this person everybody expects me to be.

32:04.990 --> 32:07.560
You know, I'm supposed to be listening to career day,

32:07.560 --> 32:08.780
And getting my grades up,

32:08.780 --> 32:10.770
And-and thinking about my future.

32:10.770 --> 32:13.690
But all I keep thinking about...

32:19.770 --> 32:21.760
Do you know what I keep thinking about?

32:25.130 --> 32:26.590
That night.

32:29.380 --> 32:31.820
And-and you can say what you want,

32:31.830 --> 32:34.970
but... To me...

32:37.250 --> 32:38.750
It was real.

32:47.580 --> 32:48.890
Lux...

32:55.530 --> 32:57.210
It was real.

33:07.150 --> 33:08.590
Lux!

33:17.210 --> 33:19.550
Hey. Been looking for you.

33:19.660 --> 33:21.330
You missed Cate's speech.

33:21.330 --> 33:23.000
Yeah, it got good towards the end,

33:23.000 --> 33:24.570
But -- Ha - Ha --

33:24.570 --> 33:25.940
You got to see the beginning.

33:25.940 --> 33:27.510
This is going on youtube.

33:27.510 --> 33:29.030
Hey, I'm Eric.

33:29.030 --> 33:32.830
Uh, Mr. Daniels was just quizzing me for the test tomorrow.

33:32.830 --> 33:34.170
Great Expectations.

33:34.170 --> 33:36.830
Oh. You're the guy that was gonna rent the room -- what happened?

33:36.830 --> 33:38.890
Oh, sorry, man, I wish I could.

33:38.890 --> 33:41.540
Uh, there's kind of circumstances that are out of my control,

33:41.540 --> 33:43.120
So it's just not gonna work out.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.210
Dude, that sucks-- you're giving up a good thing.

33:45.210 --> 33:46.660
Yeah, I know.

33:46.660 --> 33:49.000
Hey, thanks for understanding about the place.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.630
- It's nice to meet you. - Yeah.

33:54.580 --> 33:57.350
Hey. Are you all right?

33:57.980 --> 34:00.440
You missed a good porta-potty speech.

34:05.970 --> 34:08.620
Are you that stressed about this test?

34:08.620 --> 34:10.320
What if I fail?

34:10.320 --> 34:13.770
Well, uh, Cate and I are both unemployed, so...

34:13.770 --> 34:15.449
The one thing you don't have to fear

34:15.449 --> 34:17.230
In this family is failure.

34:17.230 --> 34:20.570
I mean, I think we pretty much both have that covered.

34:20.570 --> 34:22.469
You didn't want that job, anyway.

34:23.770 --> 34:26.239
Well, you-you know what's the weird thing?

34:26.239 --> 34:28.030
I kind of did.

34:28.030 --> 34:30.340
But I guess I thought that if I never even tried,

34:30.340 --> 34:31.969
I couldn't fail.

34:33.320 --> 34:35.500
But I am trying.

34:35.500 --> 34:38.320
And... Failing -- that's the problem.

34:38.320 --> 34:39.489
I get it.

34:39.969 --> 34:40.940
I do.

34:41.250 --> 34:45.199
And I will stay up late and I'll study with you, too.

34:45.199 --> 34:46.969
You know? Whatever it takes.

34:46.969 --> 34:49.510
It's kind of like what Cate said in her speech.

34:52.860 --> 34:55.840
I mean, neither one of us can give up on what we want.

35:00.140 --> 35:01.850
You got this, kiddo.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.170
So do I.

35:09.610 --> 35:10.610
All right.

35:38.690 --> 35:40.970
Thank you for being here today.

35:40.970 --> 35:44.990
You know, for being the one person in Lux's life that actually has a career.

35:45.740 --> 35:48.410
Well, I wanted you to know that I had your back.

35:48.410 --> 35:51.870
Cause I know it... Hasn't felt like it lately.

35:55.250 --> 35:57.160
You know, maybe I should have walked away, too,

35:57.160 --> 35:59.360
From the show, but I-I didn't.

35:59.360 --> 36:02.420
I did it for a lot of reasons.

36:03.590 --> 36:05.990
The biggest one is you and lux.

36:07.670 --> 36:10.290
Quitting... could have meant anything.

36:10.290 --> 36:12.180
It could've meant less money, uh...

36:12.180 --> 36:16.520
A new city, a gig that just didn't fit with having a kid.

36:16.520 --> 36:18.650
That's why I wanted to help her study.

36:18.650 --> 36:22.360
That's why I wanted to do this... this speech today.

36:24.580 --> 36:28.690
I just... I guess I just wish that somebody

36:28.690 --> 36:31.590
would have asked me to do career day.

36:32.200 --> 36:35.380
cause I want to feel like she's my kid, too, you know?

36:38.430 --> 36:39.980
Ryan, I'm sorry.

36:39.980 --> 36:42.220
You know, I should have realized that...

36:43.850 --> 36:46.520
You know, but this whole work thing-- it's just a lot.

36:50.490 --> 36:53.760
But... you know, you're right.

36:54.190 --> 36:56.600
Having a kid and being married...

36:58.330 --> 37:01.220
sometimes it means sacrifices.

37:02.140 --> 37:04.550
Well, who knows better than you that...

37:04.550 --> 37:07.320
Taking a step back...

37:07.320 --> 37:09.390
can help you move forward?

37:09.390 --> 37:13.490
And maybe, you know, you'll end up exactly where we want be.

37:13.490 --> 37:16.780
I know, but you really think it's gonna work, me producing?

37:17.040 --> 37:18.940
We'd make it work.

37:20.220 --> 37:21.700
Look, I just know that I am

37:21.700 --> 37:23.850
better with you than without you

37:29.990 --> 37:31.190
Me, too.

38:50.820 --> 38:53.680
I'm only going to take five minutes of your time.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.290
Is this going to be an everyday thing?

38:55.290 --> 38:57.240
Aaron Peters is a modestly-diversified

38:57.240 --> 38:58.910
manufacturing company which produces,

38:58.910 --> 39:00.750
among other things, sporting equipment.

39:00.750 --> 39:02.450
They tend to be pretty conservative investors,

39:02.450 --> 39:03.580
So we should probably be looking

39:03.580 --> 39:04.740
for undervalued companies for them

39:04.740 --> 39:06.760
to put their money into-- value investing.

39:06.760 --> 39:08.350
I wrote a paper about it in college.

39:08.350 --> 39:10.380
The clock is ticking on your five minutes.

39:10.380 --> 39:13.480
Okay, look, my dad-- he's an impressive guy,

39:13.480 --> 39:16.670
And when I was a little kid, I wanted to be just like him.

39:16.670 --> 39:18.680
But somewhere along the way, I stopped trying,

39:18.680 --> 39:19.900
because I knew, on some level,

39:19.900 --> 39:21.830
that I could never be just like him.

39:21.830 --> 39:25.590
So I picked something so opposite of what he was.

39:25.590 --> 39:27.390
You know, I never saw myself as a business guy,

39:27.390 --> 39:29.350
because I was afraid that I couldn't cut it,

39:29.350 --> 39:32.950
and I don't want my kid to ever not try because of that.

39:32.950 --> 39:36.940
You know, I've had a hard time admitting what I want.

39:36.940 --> 39:40.240
And... I've lost things

39:40.240 --> 39:42.520
Because of that.

39:42.520 --> 39:45.190
You know, and I'm not about to let another thing I want slip away,

39:45.190 --> 39:47.370
And you shouldn't let me slip away.

39:47.370 --> 39:49.130
I may not have the right resume or credentials,

39:49.130 --> 39:51.380
But I'm a hard worker, I'm determined, and I'm fearless

39:51.380 --> 39:53.900
Because, believe me, I have nothing to lose.

39:53.900 --> 39:56.030
So you can hire me or not. that's your call.

39:56.030 --> 39:59.060
But you got to know-- I want this job.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.270
Oh, my god. Fire girl.

40:08.270 --> 40:10.010
Baze. What are you doing here?

40:10.010 --> 40:11.680
What are you doing here? I've been looking for you.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.760
Well, I've been waiting for you to call me.

40:13.760 --> 40:14.910
You better not have given my

40:14.910 --> 40:16.580
bartending gig something else.

40:16.580 --> 40:17.830
Your bartending gig?

40:17.830 --> 40:18.730
There is no bar.

40:18.730 --> 40:20.170
What? Since when?

40:20.170 --> 40:21.670
Since you burned it down.

40:21.670 --> 40:22.590
Says who?

40:22.590 --> 40:23.870
Ah, Baze. hey.

40:25.060 --> 40:26.500
What are you doing here?

40:26.500 --> 40:27.830
Oh, have you two met?

40:27.830 --> 40:29.310
Paige, this is Lux's dad, Baze.

40:29.310 --> 40:31.260
Baze, this is Ryan's little sister.

40:33.790 --> 40:35.680
You look really familiar.

40:35.680 --> 40:37.090
Have we met before?

40:37.090 --> 40:38.430
No. Never, ever.

40:41.580 --> 40:44.010
All right, so,

40:44.010 --> 40:46.670
Math asked me to bring this over.

40:47.570 --> 40:50.090
It's Lux's English Midterm.

40:54.170 --> 40:55.940
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

40:55.940 --> 40:57.580
We actually got a 95!

40:57.580 --> 40:58.810
Oh, yeah.

40:58.810 --> 41:00.470
We need champagne. Ryan?

41:00.470 --> 41:01.190
All right, I've got it.

41:01.200 --> 41:05.020
You can't believe she got a 95! A 95!

41:05.020 --> 41:07.670
Oh, yeah. well, I don't think we...

41:07.810 --> 41:08.900
I don't think we...

41:08.900 --> 41:10.480
We don't have to do all of this.

41:10.480 --> 41:11.390
What?! Sure we do.

41:11.390 --> 41:12.300
Come on, you got an a.

41:13.130 --> 41:15.230
Plus, Cate's new job at the station.

41:16.020 --> 41:17.460
Uh, and you guys are looking

41:17.460 --> 41:19.340
at a new sales associate at Fenmore financial.

41:19.340 --> 41:20.640
You got the job?

41:20.640 --> 41:22.420
Yeah, I know. Crazy, right?

41:23.630 --> 41:24.910
Um, all right.

41:25.070 --> 41:26.070
Let's have a toast.

41:26.070 --> 41:27.020
Oh, we need one more.

41:29.190 --> 41:33.500
Okay, to all of us doing something

41:33.500 --> 41:34.490
we thought we couldn't.

41:34.490 --> 41:38.460
Oh, yes, and to Lux for doing what we all knew she could.
