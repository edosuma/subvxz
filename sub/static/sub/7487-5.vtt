do you know this guy?

00:05.206 --> 00:07.239
He's jeremy's
security guy at the firm.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.641
Uh, his name's
dan, um...

00:09.643 --> 00:12.378
Dan kubiak, former
police captain of d.C.'s
second district.

00:12.380 --> 00:16.048
Scratch that -- former
dirty police captain of
d.C.'s second district.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.350
Resigned in '08 when
rumors surfaced that
officers in his precinct

00:18.352 --> 00:20.219
Were serving as muscle
for andre butler,

00:20.221 --> 00:20.953
Notorious d.C. Drug lord.

00:24.391 --> 00:25.391

This is weird.

00:25.393 --> 00:26.625
Olivia: What?
What's he doing?

00:26.627 --> 00:28.127
Kubiak? Nothing.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.763
What's weird is you, here,
slumming it at a stakeout.

00:30.765 --> 00:33.265
I mean, don't you have a ball
to go to or whatever?

00:33.267 --> 00:35.200

I'm gladiating.

You're getting
your expensive pants dirty.

what are you doing here?

00:41.307 --> 00:43.242

avoiding me.

Really?

00:45.312 --> 00:47.179
Eyes on the target.

00:49.482 --> 00:52.351
Before he was forced
out, kubiak refused to
roll on any of his men.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.219
So he still has plenty
of pals on the force.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.055
Started his own private
security firm after that.

00:56.057 --> 01:00.325

secrets of very scary people.

of kubiak's work is for...

jeremy's law firm.

had something to do with this?

he killed caitlin?

01:07.535 --> 01:08.534
I don't know.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.069
All I know
is that kubiak

was in that folder.

No.

at the station -- total pro job.

looked pretty clean.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.330
And our tip
that it was kubiak?

02:45.332 --> 02:48.333
Turns out that when
you're an ex-cop with
friends all over the force,

02:48.335 --> 02:49.801
You get a pretty great alibi
whenever you need one.

We saw him.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.572
Actually, he was drinking
at shots all night.

At least six off-duty officers
and the owner all confirm.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.645

to do?
