all you have to do

18:23.267 --> 18:24.434
I know. You gotta sober up.

18:24.434 --> 18:25.934
You gotta sober up.

18:25.934 --> 18:27.934
I'm not the one that's been
drinking since noon.

18:27.934 --> 18:30.200
That dog had a lot of hair.
What drinking since noon?

18:30.200 --> 18:31.767
I had a couple of beers
with lunch.

18:31.767 --> 18:32.801
Let go of me.
Three.

18:32.801 --> 18:34.400
And two while we watched
the game.

18:34.400 --> 18:35.400
Yeah? Who's counting?

18:35.400 --> 18:36.934
Stop squeezing my arm,
all right?

18:37.667 --> 18:39.567
Whoa, sorry.

18:39.567 --> 18:41.300
Bailey.

18:41.300 --> 18:42.367
Sarah.

18:43.467 --> 18:45.000
Whoa.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.901
Will, look, it's Sarah.
You remember Sarah.

18:47.901 --> 18:49.267
Sarah.

18:49.267 --> 18:52.167
Wow. Look at you,
you're-- How you doing?

18:52.167 --> 18:53.634
God. Will

18:53.634 --> 18:55.534
Hey, Sarah. I'm just--

18:55.534 --> 18:57.767
Oh, Will-- Will just broke up
with his girlfriend.

18:57.767 --> 18:59.067
But between you and me,

18:59.067 --> 19:00.234
it's probably a good thing

19:00.234 --> 19:01.734
because she treated him
like crap.

19:01.734 --> 19:03.767
Just ask him.
He'll tell you all about it.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.033
Bailey--

19:05.033 --> 19:07.501
But-- But you two could probably
compare notes, huh?

19:07.501 --> 19:09.567
Hey, maybe you guys could even
get back together.

19:09.567 --> 19:11.934
You know what? I-- I should--
I should probably just go.

19:11.934 --> 19:13.501
Wait, no, no, no.
Don't go.

19:13.501 --> 19:14.801
Hang around, we're gonna stay.

19:14.801 --> 19:15.934
We'll get a table.

19:15.934 --> 19:17.667
Whoa. Sorry.

19:17.667 --> 19:18.834
[LAUGHS]
Sorry.

19:18.834 --> 19:20.434
I'm sorry, I got it.
I got that. Sorry.

19:20.434 --> 19:21.434
Bailey, come on.

19:21.434 --> 19:22.934
You better get this
guy out of here.

19:22.934 --> 19:25.234
WILL: Bailey, come on.
Hey, hey, I can walk.

19:26.634 --> 19:27.567
Sarah?

19:29.868 --> 19:32.200
[SIGHS]
She really hates me.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.534
Imagine.

19:35.968 --> 19:39.434
Okay, we got <i>Go, Dog. Go!</i>
Timeless classic.

19:39.434 --> 19:41.367
 <i>Are You My Mother?</i>

19:41.367 --> 19:43.133
It's probably the last thing
you need.

19:43.133 --> 19:45.434
You want to pick?

19:47.133 --> 19:51.934
 <i>* I know I am right there *</i>

19:51.934 --> 19:54.968
 <i>* Where you are *</i>

20:04.834 --> 20:11.200
 <i>* When one mind meets another *</i>

20:11.200 --> 20:14.968
 <i>* In generosity *</i>

20:17.801 --> 20:20.067
Oh, Charlie, I was just--

20:20.067 --> 20:22.300
I think maybe I should sleep
down here tonight.

20:22.300 --> 20:23.300
I mean, it's only fair.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.367
You don't have to do that.

20:24.367 --> 20:25.367
No, no.

20:25.367 --> 20:26.701
Obviously, this is
weird for you,

20:26.701 --> 20:28.200
and I'm the one
that's putting you out.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.033
So it's fine. Really.

20:33.033 --> 20:33.968
Good night.
No, hey.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.567
Whoa. Life goes on, huh?

20:55.400 --> 20:56.534
You know what?

20:56.534 --> 20:58.667
This is only gonna frustrate
both of us, so--

20:58.667 --> 21:01.200
So stay with me.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.601
With you? But what--?
What about--?

21:02.601 --> 21:05.000
Yeah, I know.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.400
But you're gonna be here
for at least a few days,

21:07.400 --> 21:11.767
and I feel like I'm holding you
hostage with my stupid hangup.

21:13.167 --> 21:15.000
So come on.

21:19.701 --> 21:21.801
No. You know what?

21:21.801 --> 21:23.801
You shouldn't be uncomfortable
in your own bed.

21:23.801 --> 21:26.667
That's insane.
No. I'm insane.

21:26.667 --> 21:29.567
And the truth is
I'm just avoiding it.

21:29.567 --> 21:32.601
And I gotta get past that
because that's stupid.

21:32.601 --> 21:35.033
If I don't, we're both
gonna be miserable.

21:35.033 --> 21:36.868
So I just gotta take the plunge.

21:36.868 --> 21:38.868
I gotta get back on that horse--

21:38.868 --> 21:41.534
[LAUGHS]
Well, that's a bad analogy.

21:44.634 --> 21:47.901
You sure you're okay
with this?

21:47.901 --> 21:50.601
You said it.
Life goes on.

22:01.868 --> 22:04.634
Oh, hey.

22:04.634 --> 22:05.734
Hey.

22:05.734 --> 22:08.801
So, um, I got up for a snack
around 3,

22:08.801 --> 22:10.734
and I-- and I couldn't help
but noticing

22:10.734 --> 22:14.133
that the sofa
hadn't been slept on.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.767
Oh, yeah.

22:15.767 --> 22:17.734
Um, about that--

22:17.734 --> 22:20.367
So I'm just, you know,
I was guessing

22:20.367 --> 22:23.100
that Grace found
another place to stay.

22:23.100 --> 22:25.901
Well, you could say that. It's--

22:25.901 --> 22:28.667
Which is probably a good thing,
right? Because--

22:31.868 --> 22:34.701
Oh, Claudia, good morning.

22:35.968 --> 22:36.901
Do you mind?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.067
Be my guest.

22:45.667 --> 22:50.334
Sarah, hey, um, your dad said
it was okay if I--

22:50.334 --> 22:52.467
Hey.

22:52.467 --> 22:54.801
Hi. It's-- It's, uh,
nice to see you.

22:54.801 --> 22:56.234
Yeah, you too.

23:00.767 --> 23:02.234
Wow. You-- You still--

23:03.400 --> 23:06.868
Oh, uh, yeah, you know, I just--

23:06.868 --> 23:09.767
I haven't gotten around
to taking them down yet.

23:09.767 --> 23:11.334
I-- I just kept thinking--

23:12.801 --> 23:15.234
Stupid, huh?

23:16.501 --> 23:19.300
Anyway, no time
like the present.

23:20.501 --> 23:21.701
You look great.

23:21.701 --> 23:24.200
How are you?

23:24.200 --> 23:27.667
Eh, my life sucks right now.

23:28.801 --> 23:31.133
Like, you know, totally.

23:31.133 --> 23:33.534
But I'm okay.

23:33.534 --> 23:35.334
Yeah, me too.

23:37.367 --> 23:40.667
Look, um, I know this is
probably none of my business,

23:40.667 --> 23:44.133
but what's going on
with Bailey?

23:44.133 --> 23:45.067
I mean--

23:46.334 --> 23:48.434
You'd have to ask him.

23:51.367 --> 23:53.033
How long has he been drinking
like this?

23:53.033 --> 23:55.567
I don't know.

23:55.567 --> 23:57.300
I mean, I-- I know
that he drinks sometimes.

23:57.300 --> 24:00.000
But it's like he's this--

24:00.000 --> 24:01.200
This whole different person

24:01.200 --> 24:03.300
since he got together
with Callie.

24:03.300 --> 24:05.701
Got together? What do you mean?
I thought they were roommates.

24:05.701 --> 24:08.400
Just mates, apparently.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.567
Didn't he tell you?

24:13.534 --> 24:16.400
You mean, he didn't--?

24:16.400 --> 24:18.834
Oh, that's why we broke up.
I thought you knew.

24:18.834 --> 24:21.567
No.

24:21.567 --> 24:25.067
Actually, he forgot
to mention that.

24:25.067 --> 24:26.667
Wow.

24:26.667 --> 24:28.701
Yeah. Well, anyway...

24:30.367 --> 24:31.701
Hey, I'm sorry.

24:31.701 --> 24:33.901
I didn't mean to--

24:33.901 --> 24:36.133
I just thought if he's been
doing this for a while,

24:36.133 --> 24:37.734
with the drinking, I mean,

24:37.734 --> 24:39.067
maybe we should do
something.

24:39.067 --> 24:44.601
You know what, Will,
I sort of can't go there.

24:44.601 --> 24:47.100
Yeah, I'm still trying to get
over this, you know.

24:48.334 --> 24:50.567
And i-if Bailey has
some kind of problem,

24:50.567 --> 24:54.534
well, it's his problem,
not mine.

24:56.667 --> 24:58.501
His.

25:06.033 --> 25:07.267
Ah.

25:07.267 --> 25:10.400
[BANG AT DOOR]

25:10.400 --> 25:13.801
Hey, you don't have to bang
the damn door down.

25:13.801 --> 25:14.801
What the hell are you--?

25:14.801 --> 25:15.968
Sorry. I--

25:15.968 --> 25:17.300
What happened to you?

25:18.701 --> 25:20.167
Are you sick or something?

25:20.167 --> 25:23.968
Um, yeah, yeah.

25:23.968 --> 25:26.234
I am. I-- I ate some bad...

25:26.234 --> 25:27.667
I really need to talk to you.

25:27.667 --> 25:30.000
Oh, this is--
Not right now, Claud.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.567
Yeah, right now. That's why
I came all the way over here.

25:32.567 --> 25:33.934
I don't know who else
I can talk to.

25:33.934 --> 25:37.200
You're like...
you're, like, it.

25:43.934 --> 25:44.868
What's going on?

25:46.400 --> 25:48.767
You have to talk to Julia.

25:48.767 --> 25:50.300
Or-- Or Charlie. Or somebody.

25:52.601 --> 25:54.467
Talk about what?

25:54.467 --> 25:56.601
About this stupid fight
they're having.

25:56.601 --> 25:58.434
Now Julia's moved out,

25:58.434 --> 26:01.200
and Charlie, he's got Grace
staying with us.

26:01.200 --> 26:04.100
And it's like the whole family
is just falling apart.

26:04.100 --> 26:06.200
And you were the one that always
kept things together.

26:06.200 --> 26:09.901
And nobody's doing that anymore.

26:11.734 --> 26:14.968
So you'll talk to them, right?

26:14.968 --> 26:16.400
[SIGHS]

26:17.868 --> 26:19.601
I don't-- I don't know.

26:19.601 --> 26:21.033
What do you mean,
you don't know?

26:21.033 --> 26:22.300
I mean--

26:22.300 --> 26:24.367
I mean, they're gonna have
to work this out

26:24.367 --> 26:27.133
on their own, Claud,
because I can't.

26:27.133 --> 26:28.534
They're not speaking
to each other.

26:28.534 --> 26:30.567
You have to do something.
You always know what to do.

26:30.567 --> 26:31.968
They'll listen to you.
No, I don't.

26:31.968 --> 26:35.300
I-- I can't, Claud, okay?
I can't help you.

26:36.501 --> 26:38.067
[SIGHS]

26:38.067 --> 26:39.501
I don't live there anymore.

26:39.501 --> 26:41.834
Okay?

26:41.834 --> 26:44.767
So this really isn't my problem.

26:46.100 --> 26:48.467
Sorry I bothered you.

26:56.801 --> 26:57.734
Hello?

26:58.868 --> 27:01.534
Julia! Hello?

27:01.534 --> 27:03.434
JULIA:
Coming.

27:03.434 --> 27:04.667
Hey.

27:04.667 --> 27:05.934
Can you open the door, please?

27:05.934 --> 27:07.267
Oh, yeah, hang on.

27:07.267 --> 27:09.367
You just, uh, wedged the chain
in the little thingie.

27:09.367 --> 27:10.300
Pull the door a little.

27:11.067 --> 27:12.067
I'll get it.

27:12.067 --> 27:13.234
JULIA:
What's the rush?

27:13.234 --> 27:14.334
Something wrong?
I got it.

27:14.334 --> 27:17.601
Yeah. I've only got,
like, 30 seconds.

27:17.601 --> 27:19.234
Thirty seconds for what?

27:19.234 --> 27:20.367
The Flyers and the Rangers.

27:20.367 --> 27:21.667
Oh, um--

27:21.667 --> 27:23.667
I've planned my whole week
so I could get home in time

27:23.667 --> 27:25.033
for the face-off...
Oh, uh, Sam--

27:25.033 --> 27:27.234
...which happens
in exactly 35 seconds.

27:27.234 --> 27:29.400
 <i>Yum, yum, yum.</i>

27:31.334 --> 27:32.834
No. No. It's okay.

27:32.834 --> 27:35.133
Look, Owen, we gotta
turn this off now, okay?

27:35.133 --> 27:37.267
No!
No. I-- I mean it.

27:37.267 --> 27:38.934
It's Sam's turn to watch TV.
Remember Sam?

27:38.934 --> 27:42.000
No, no, no!

27:42.000 --> 27:45.267
You promised.

27:45.267 --> 27:47.300
It's...

27:47.300 --> 27:48.701
Okay.

27:48.701 --> 27:51.234
Look, I'll, uh-- I'll watch it
in the bedroom.

27:51.234 --> 27:54.701
What, on-- On that little TV?
That doesn't seem fair.

27:58.801 --> 28:00.400
Watch your step,
all right?

28:00.400 --> 28:02.167
We've got the floor braced
from underneath,

28:02.167 --> 28:04.067
but it's still
pretty dangerous.

28:06.133 --> 28:09.000
Are you okay?

28:09.000 --> 28:10.834
Oh, here.
I have my key.

28:15.434 --> 28:16.901
I can't let you stay
in there too long.

28:16.901 --> 28:18.901
And you can only take
whatever you can carry.

28:18.901 --> 28:20.067
Sorry.

28:20.067 --> 28:22.234
No, no, thank you.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.501
I can't believe it.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Whew.

28:30.300 --> 28:33.667
Man, where should we start?

28:35.634 --> 28:37.601
I don't-- I don't know.

28:37.601 --> 28:39.467
I thought there would be...

28:45.067 --> 28:46.334
pictures.

28:46.334 --> 28:48.868
My, uh, grandmother gave me
all the family pictures.

28:48.868 --> 28:51.300
I was gonna have copies made

28:51.300 --> 28:53.300
for my parents' anniversary.

28:54.767 --> 28:57.934
Your landlord was, um,
holding this for you.

28:57.934 --> 29:00.834
Oh, thank you.

29:04.734 --> 29:05.834
What is it?

29:05.834 --> 29:07.434
I don't know.

29:13.267 --> 29:17.234
It's, um, a bedspread
that I ordered two weeks ago

29:17.234 --> 29:18.868
after I painted my bedroom.

29:18.868 --> 29:22.834
It cost way more
than I could afford, but--

29:22.834 --> 29:25.434
So you haven't lost
everything, right?

29:30.334 --> 29:31.367
[CRIES]

29:31.367 --> 29:32.801
Come here.

29:41.701 --> 29:44.033
Hey, I thought I was gonna
pick you up.

29:44.033 --> 29:45.634
Yeah. I know. It's, uh--

29:45.634 --> 29:48.367
It's just I was kind of hoping
we could talk.

29:48.367 --> 29:53.601
Will, Will, Will, you gotta
let go of her, man.

29:53.601 --> 29:55.367
More talking is not gonna
do you any good.

29:55.367 --> 29:57.434
No. It's not--
It's not about that.

29:57.434 --> 30:01.234
Oh, okay.

30:01.234 --> 30:03.400
Um, well, there's a place right
down on the corner.

30:03.400 --> 30:04.868
Let's go grab a beer and talk.

30:04.868 --> 30:06.567
No. See, that's the thing.

30:06.567 --> 30:08.234
I'm still queasy
from the other night.

30:08.234 --> 30:10.501
Well, you just gotta learn
how to pace yourself.

30:10.501 --> 30:11.701
No, no. Wait a minute.

30:11.701 --> 30:14.767
That's what I wanna...

30:14.767 --> 30:16.267
It's like--

30:16.267 --> 30:17.701
It's just-- 

30:17.701 --> 30:21.934
It seems like all you want to do
anymore is drink.

30:23.300 --> 30:24.734
What?

30:26.133 --> 30:27.901
Well, welcome to college, Will.

30:27.901 --> 30:29.234
That's kind of part of it.
I know.

30:29.234 --> 30:32.634
I know that. But my point is,

30:32.634 --> 30:36.067
it's just you're drinking a lot.

30:36.934 --> 30:38.334
Like a lot.

30:38.334 --> 30:40.434
Yeah. Especially
since you've been here.

30:40.434 --> 30:44.033
But I thought we were-- What?

30:44.033 --> 30:46.267
Do--? Do you do you have some
kind of problem with that?

30:46.267 --> 30:50.534
More to the point, Bay, do you?

30:52.534 --> 30:55.534
[LAUGHS]

30:55.534 --> 30:56.634
Whoa.

30:56.634 --> 30:59.000
Y-you gotta be kidding me
here, right?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.400
No, I'm not. I-- I mean, I don't
even recognize you anymore.

31:01.400 --> 31:04.133
It's like you're out of control
or something.

31:04.133 --> 31:05.400
You're drinking all the time.

31:05.400 --> 31:06.868
You dumped a great girlfriend.

31:06.868 --> 31:08.801
Hey, hey, she dumped me.

31:08.801 --> 31:10.501
Okay?
Yeah, whatever.

31:10.501 --> 31:11.901
What?

31:11.901 --> 31:13.167
What's with the tone?

31:13.167 --> 31:15.000
Come on, Bay,
it doesn't take a genius

31:15.000 --> 31:16.934
to figure out
what's going on here.

31:16.934 --> 31:19.100
Going on?

31:19.100 --> 31:20.934
You're not-- You know what,

making you nuts.

31:22.934 --> 31:24.667

Will you listen to me?

31:24.667 --> 31:26.834
No. I don't want to because
you're way out of line.

31:28.467 --> 31:30.567
You come home, and you're
totally bummed out and--

31:30.567 --> 31:32.434
And, hey, I--
I'm bummed out too.

31:32.434 --> 31:33.934
So I try to be
a good friend to you

31:33.934 --> 31:35.767
and help you try and take
your mind off things--

31:35.767 --> 31:37.667
Wait a minute. No, don't try
to make this about me.

31:37.667 --> 31:39.334
Well, it is about you, Will.

31:39.334 --> 31:41.033
I was just trying
to show you a good time.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.801
And excuse me, I don't remember
even once hearing you say

31:43.801 --> 31:44.901
you weren't having fun.

31:46.267 --> 31:48.267
You should have said something
and we could've...

31:49.701 --> 31:52.901
gone bowling or whatever
instead of...

31:52.901 --> 31:54.000
I don't believe this.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.300
You're accusing me of...
You know what?

31:57.300 --> 31:58.767
You know what, Will?
Go to hell.

31:58.767 --> 31:59.801
Okay? Just go to hell.

31:59.801 --> 32:01.467
I-- I'm worried about you.

32:01.467 --> 32:02.501
I'm only trying to help.

You want to help?

Charlie, hi.

32:39.601 --> 32:41.067
Were you ever gonna
call me back?

32:41.067 --> 32:42.701
I hadn't planned to, nope.

32:42.701 --> 32:44.133
Hey, you know what, Jule?

32:44.133 --> 32:45.601
I-- I'm sick of this.

32:45.601 --> 32:49.000
You don't leave me notes saying
that Owen is staying over here.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.868
He is not staying over here.

32:50.868 --> 32:52.200
And you don't--
You don't do that.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.300
God, listen to you.

32:53.300 --> 32:54.767
And I don't want any
of this attitude.

All right?
He is coming home.

And you know what?
You're coming home too.

Wait a minute.

you, but she's not staying.

with you right now.

Come here. It's okay, Owen.
It's okay.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.534
I told you to wait in the truck.

I am not going home

33:29.133 --> 33:31.400

like some stupid kid.

Maybe when you stop
acting like one.

I've made many adult decisions
and you're happy to let me.

one call to make you.

out of here.

out the first pancake?

34:38.667 --> 34:39.667
Mm-hm.

34:39.667 --> 34:42.801
Well, I'm thinking

34:42.801 --> 34:45.333
maybe I shouldn't
stop there.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.467

know the difference.

This is so sweet.

You cooked for me.

34:55.900 --> 34:58.133
Yeah.

34:58.133 --> 35:00.234
I thought I should do
something nice.

35:00.234 --> 35:01.534
Should?

35:01.534 --> 35:04.834
Yeah, to counteract something
not so nice.

35:07.868 --> 35:09.834
Why am I nervous
all of a sudden?

35:09.834 --> 35:11.567
Look, Julia,

35:11.567 --> 35:14.334
I really like you.

35:16.868 --> 35:21.667
Sam, that is not a good opener.

35:21.667 --> 35:24.100
Wait. Hold on. I like you.

35:24.100 --> 35:27.400
And the thought of having you
live here with me is...

35:29.701 --> 35:31.100
Well, it's very tempting.

35:32.601 --> 35:34.467
But it might be nice to try it

35:34.467 --> 35:36.400
when you're actually here
because of me

35:36.400 --> 35:38.367
and not because you're running
away from home.

35:38.367 --> 35:41.434
Look, I know that things
are tough for you right now

35:41.434 --> 35:44.167

35:44.167 --> 35:45.834
But you guys have
to work that out.

35:45.834 --> 35:47.767
And-- And until you do,
it's just--

35:47.767 --> 35:52.534
I got a nice quiet little
life going here.

35:52.534 --> 35:58.300
I come home. I watch a little
TV. Listen to some music.

35:58.300 --> 36:01.701
And I kind of like it that way.

36:03.701 --> 36:06.667
So, what you're trying
to say to me

36:06.667 --> 36:10.000
in the nicest way possible

36:10.000 --> 36:13.567
is that you'd like me
to get the hell out?

for all that drinking.

back up a minute here?

just ask you,

No. I mean it.

I thought about last night,
and I should have--

37:02.033 --> 37:04.234
I should have just come out
and asked you point-blank

37:04.234 --> 37:05.667
instead of...

37:07.100 --> 37:09.467
Just tell me.

me like you were--

with the partying.

37:30.367 --> 37:31.868

37:34.200 --> 37:36.033
You haven't been around
these past four months

because if you had, you wouldn't
even ask me that, Will.

that it's not a problem.

and then glue the macaroni
to the page for the branches.

been together long enough.

40:05.901 --> 40:07.601
And there are about

40:07.601 --> 40:10.667
a million practical,
logical reasons

40:10.667 --> 40:12.100
why this is a bad idea.

40:12.100 --> 40:15.968
There's also one reason
why it's a good idea.

40:15.968 --> 40:17.234
And what's that?

40:17.234 --> 40:22.968
Because I really, really
want this with you.

40:23.934 --> 40:24.934
I mean,

40:24.934 --> 40:26.734
I still sleep on
one side of the bed.

40:26.734 --> 40:28.167
You know that?

40:28.167 --> 40:31.367
And I still put my toothbrush
in the same hole in the little--

40:31.367 --> 40:32.567
The little thingie.

40:32.567 --> 40:35.767
I mean, old habits, right?

40:35.767 --> 40:40.234
Well, that's just--
That's just dumb, is what it is.

40:40.234 --> 40:42.033
So I-- I want you
to come in here

40:42.033 --> 40:45.167
and make me change all that.

40:45.167 --> 40:48.100
It's time to shake things up.

40:48.100 --> 40:50.267
Because I'm ready.

40:50.267 --> 40:53.267
Wow, Charlie--

40:53.267 --> 40:56.267
Hey, we're both making
a fresh start here,

40:56.267 --> 40:58.934
but who says
that has to be hard?

40:58.934 --> 41:02.334
I mean, maybe if we do it
together...

41:07.634 --> 41:08.667
Help me make the bed?

41:08.667 --> 41:11.200
[LAUGHS]

41:21.968 --> 41:23.901
Hey, there you are.

41:23.901 --> 41:25.567
Did you and Will have fun?

41:25.567 --> 41:27.133
Huh?

41:27.133 --> 41:28.367
Oh, yeah.

41:28.367 --> 41:31.167
Yeah, it was great.

41:31.167 --> 41:32.434
What are you doing?

41:32.434 --> 41:36.634
I'm making martinis.
Shaken, not stirred.

41:36.634 --> 41:38.901
You can tell me
if they're any good.

41:38.901 --> 41:41.601
Actually, I've never had
a martini before.

41:41.601 --> 41:44.234
So I don't know
that I'd be the best judge.

41:44.234 --> 41:47.601
Well, after a couple of these,
it probably won't matter.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.467
So now, the book says

41:53.467 --> 41:55.067
that you're supposed to drink it

41:55.067 --> 41:56.567
quickly,

41:56.567 --> 41:59.667
while it's still
laughing at you.

41:59.667 --> 42:01.334
[LAUGHS]
Whatever that means.

42:01.334 --> 42:02.267
 <i>L'chaim.</i>

42:08.400 --> 42:10.234
See, I told you
this would look cool.

42:10.234 --> 42:11.934
[BOTH LAUGH]

42:11.934 --> 42:14.334
Yeah.

42:14.334 --> 42:15.467
So you gonna come in here

42:15.467 --> 42:18.868
and take my bed down for me
every night?

42:18.868 --> 42:20.667
I got a better idea.

42:20.667 --> 42:22.868
What?

42:22.868 --> 42:26.234
My bed's a queen size, so...

42:26.234 --> 42:30.234
It's a lot of wasted mattress.

42:30.234 --> 42:31.834
You mean you want me to--?

42:33.767 --> 42:34.868
Don't you?

42:37.133 --> 42:39.100
What?

42:39.100 --> 42:40.634
You think it's a bad idea?

42:40.634 --> 42:42.834
No. No.

42:42.834 --> 42:44.767
I think--

42:47.734 --> 42:52.267
I don't think I've ever told you
how great you are.

42:56.467 --> 42:59.934
It must be the liquor talking.

42:59.934 --> 43:02.334
Yeah, it must be.

43:08.767 --> 43:10.200
[CLEARS THROAT]

43:13.267 --> 43:15.534
Uh-huh.

43:15.534 --> 43:18.067
I think it stopped laughing.

43:19.767 --> 43:21.200
[***]

43:37.234 --> 43:39.334
[***]

43:40.305 --> 43:46.515
