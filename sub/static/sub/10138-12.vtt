00:02.169 --> 00:04.588
Big day at the playground

00:02.169 --> 00:04.588
today, guys.

00:04.630 --> 00:07.758
I'm gonna teach you how to swing

00:04.630 --> 00:07.758
without anybody pushing you.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.679
- Impossible.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.679
- Can't be done.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.515
All you have to do is

00:11.720 --> 00:14.515
learn how to pump your legs.

00:14.556 --> 00:17.225
Watch me and do what I do.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.978
'Come on, boys.'

00:24.984 --> 00:27.528
Not everything I do, huh?

00:27.569 --> 00:29.738
Just the leg pumping.

00:29.780 --> 00:32.324
Now swing your legs in..

00:32.366 --> 00:34.409
...and out.

00:34.451 --> 00:37.454
In...and out.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.832
In...and out.

00:39.874 --> 00:42.877
But we are not going anywhere.

00:42.918 --> 00:45.462
I told you it can't be done.

00:46.839 --> 00:49.257
She's cuckoo.

Hey, thanks for

01:38.974 --> 01:40.392
letting me tag along

01:40.434 --> 01:42.352
with you guys

01:40.434 --> 01:42.352
to the street fair.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.271
Yeah, well, this year,

01:42.394 --> 01:44.271
remember that nachos

01:44.312 --> 01:47.190
and that Tilt-A-Whirl,

01:44.312 --> 01:47.190
don't mix.

01:47.232 --> 01:50.652
You're telling me?

01:47.232 --> 01:50.652
I really liked that sweater.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.448
Thank you.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.747
Hi, Kimmy. Hi, Nelson.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.249
Hi, D.J., it's good

02:01.789 --> 02:04.249
to see you again.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.879
What are you doing?

02:08.921 --> 02:10.380
Checking your eyesight.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.340
You've got

02:10.422 --> 02:12.340
eight trillion dollars

02:12.382 --> 02:14.009
and you're dating Gibbler.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.763
Gibbler? No.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.681
No, no, we're just..

02:19.723 --> 02:22.225
We're just, we're friends.

02:22.267 --> 02:25.813
Well, um, I was hoping we'd be

02:22.267 --> 02:25.813
a little more than friends.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.565
Like, uh, husband and wife?

02:31.192 --> 02:33.904
So, D.J., uh..

02:33.946 --> 02:36.406
I suppose I'll be meeting this

02:33.946 --> 02:36.406
guy you've been seeing, huh?

02:36.448 --> 02:38.492
- Viper.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.492
- Viper? Ah!

02:38.533 --> 02:42.579
Uh, let me guess. You,

02:38.533 --> 02:42.579
you didn't meet at the library.

02:42.621 --> 02:45.624
He plays the guitar

02:42.621 --> 02:45.624
in my Uncle Jesse's band.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.292
He's running a little late.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.754
Ooh! Old boyfriend

02:47.334 --> 02:50.754
meets new boyfriend

Uh, Nelson, you know

02:55.300 --> 02:57.218
that you're going

02:57.260 --> 02:59.262
to the street fair

02:57.260 --> 02:59.262
with a local legend.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.807
Uh, Kimmy won the pie-eating

02:59.304 --> 03:01.807
contest three years in a row.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.392
It's a gift.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.392
I got it from my mom.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.521
She can swallow

03:04.434 --> 03:07.521
a frisbee whole.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.023
[doorbell ringing]

03:09.064 --> 03:10.816
That's Viper.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.819
Well, time to warm up

03:10.858 --> 03:13.819
the old chops.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.904
Hey!

03:15.946 --> 03:17.906
Pineapple cheesecake.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.867
This is not gonna be pretty.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.915
Do you believe in being honest?

03:26.957 --> 03:28.583
I believe in saying hello.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.919
Deej, I could

03:28.625 --> 03:30.919
beat around the bush.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.005
I could stall.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.005
I could hem and haw.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.756
You could just say it.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.591
Okay.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.594
I think things between us

03:36.633 --> 03:39.594
are moving too fast.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.180
Uh, you probably

03:39.636 --> 03:41.180
feel the same way.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.683
Like, uh, you need

03:41.221 --> 03:44.683
a little room to breathe?

03:44.725 --> 03:49.063
I was breathing fine until

03:44.725 --> 03:49.063
you started talking like this.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.565
Well, it's just, you know,

03:49.104 --> 03:51.565
one day we meet

03:51.606 --> 03:55.402
and the next thing you know,

03:51.606 --> 03:55.402
boom, we're-we're a couple.

03:55.443 --> 03:58.279
So, what are you saying?

03:55.443 --> 03:58.279
Boom! We're breaking up?

03:59.614 --> 04:03.368
- I guess I am.

03:59.614 --> 04:03.368
- But I don't understand.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.786
I thought

04:03.410 --> 04:04.786
everything was going great.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.580
I-i-it's not you,

04:04.828 --> 04:06.580
it's, it's me.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.749
Okay? I just, uh..

04:08.790 --> 04:10.542
I need a little space.

04:12.293 --> 04:14.629
I'm sorry, Deej.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.423
I gotta go.

04:24.848 --> 04:28.602
[laughing]

04:24.848 --> 04:28.602
Gibbler just gobbled that pie..

04:28.643 --> 04:32.773
...in one minute two..

04:28.643 --> 04:32.773
Just, gah!

04:32.814 --> 04:34.233
Well, I guess

04:32.814 --> 04:34.233
we better get going.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.485
Where is this, uh, Viper guy?

04:37.527 --> 04:42.241
Oh, um, he just dropped by

04:37.527 --> 04:42.241
to say that he couldn't make it.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.827
Oh! Are you okay?

04:45.869 --> 04:48.038
Yeah. Fine.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.582
No, you're not.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.582
What's the matter?

04:53.668 --> 04:56.213
Viper just broke up with me.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.382
Oh, Deej.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.387
It's okay.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.387
It's okay, Deej.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.350
Oh, I feel awful.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.350
I never even saw it coming.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.730
I know how that feels.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.235
Oh!

05:18.277 --> 05:21.321
Hey, if you felt this bad

05:18.277 --> 05:21.321
when I did to you

05:21.362 --> 05:23.740
I'm really sorry.

05:23.782 --> 05:27.327
The thing to remember

05:23.782 --> 05:27.327
is that the pain does go away.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.081
I hope so.

05:31.123 --> 05:34.459
But it is replaced by this

05:31.123 --> 05:34.459
big, empty, hollow feeling.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.048
Let's hit the swings.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.308
My playground.

05:49.348 --> 05:52.769
- What a mess.

05:49.348 --> 05:52.769
- Michelle, who did that?

05:52.811 --> 05:55.730
I'll tell you who did that.

05:55.772 --> 05:59.193
- Dad, who did that?

05:55.772 --> 05:59.193
- I don't know, Michelle.

05:59.234 --> 06:00.861
Unfortunately, there

05:59.234 --> 06:00.861
are some people out there

06:00.902 --> 06:03.197
who take out their anger

06:00.902 --> 06:03.197
on other people's property.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.573
Shame on them.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.160
Double shame.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.287
You said it, guys.

06:10.329 --> 06:13.540
I wanna go home, dad.

06:13.581 --> 06:15.917
Okay, honey. Let's go.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.677
Alright. Thanks a lot.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.386
So, Danny, what's the word

06:25.719 --> 06:27.386
from City Hall?

06:27.428 --> 06:30.807
Well, the word is, there's

06:27.428 --> 06:30.807
still 65 vandalized playgrounds

06:30.849 --> 06:32.600
they have to be fixed up

06:30.849 --> 06:32.600
ahead of us.

06:32.642 --> 06:36.313
They're still cleaning off

06:32.642 --> 06:36.313
park walls that say disco sucks.

06:36.355 --> 06:39.983
No playground? Nicky and Alex

06:36.355 --> 06:39.983
will never learn to pump.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.318
Oh, yes, they will.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.986
Now if the city's

06:41.360 --> 06:42.986
not gonna get involved

06:43.028 --> 06:44.946
then I say we take

06:43.028 --> 06:44.946
some action ourselves.

06:44.988 --> 06:48.283
Every kid has the God

06:44.988 --> 06:48.283
given right to pump.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.202
You know what, he's right,

06:48.325 --> 06:50.202
and we're gonna get the whole

06:50.244 --> 06:52.246
neighborhood to help

06:50.244 --> 06:52.246
rebuild that playground.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.915
The-the slide's gonna be slidier

06:54.956 --> 06:57.625
and the monkey bars

06:54.956 --> 06:57.625
are gonna be monkier.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.711
Monkier?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.088
You get the idea.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.589
This is gonna

07:01.129 --> 07:02.589
be the best playground

07:02.630 --> 07:03.798
any kid has ever played in.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.843
Yeah, with big,

07:03.840 --> 07:06.843
wide, sturdy swings

07:06.885 --> 07:10.222
with plenty of room,

07:06.885 --> 07:10.222
so the chains don't squeeze

07:10.264 --> 07:12.473
your car keys into your thighs.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.354
Well,

07:15.018 --> 07:17.354
'cause-'cause kids hate that.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.193
- Hey, Comet.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.193
- Hi, Comet.

07:23.235 --> 07:25.737
Hey, Nelson, thanks for taking

07:23.235 --> 07:25.737
us to the street fair today.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.822
- I had a blast.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.822
- Not me.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.866
It was the worst day of my life.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.785
You're just bitter

07:29.908 --> 07:31.785
because you were disqualified

07:31.826 --> 07:33.412
from the pie-eating contest.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.123
Man, you swallow one fork.

07:38.208 --> 07:42.087
Well, on that note, I think

07:38.208 --> 07:42.087
it's time to, uh, free Willy.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.425
Nelson, thanks

07:44.089 --> 07:46.425
for winning me this monkey.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.261
It was so cute how

07:46.466 --> 07:49.261
you kept trying and trying.

07:49.303 --> 07:52.764
Oh, I knew I'd knock down those

07:49.303 --> 07:52.764
milk bottles sooner or later.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.100
Yeah, $700 later.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.729
Uh, so you had

07:57.060 --> 07:59.729
a good time today?

07:59.771 --> 08:02.357
Yeah, yeah, thanks to you.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.525
Um, for a while there,

08:02.399 --> 08:04.525
I actually forgot

08:04.567 --> 08:07.362
I've been dumped.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.990
You know, D.J.,

08:07.404 --> 08:09.990
any guy that would dump you

08:10.031 --> 08:11.866
would have to be

08:10.031 --> 08:11.866
out of his mind.

08:11.908 --> 08:17.122
Aww! Why can't all guys

08:11.908 --> 08:17.122
be as sweet as you?

08:17.164 --> 08:19.666
Why can't all girls

08:17.164 --> 08:19.666
be as pretty as you?

08:22.336 --> 08:25.130
Thanks for a great day, Nelson.

08:22.336 --> 08:25.130
I really had fun.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.230
Did something just happen here?

08:43.690 --> 08:45.525
I don't know.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.280
Maybe, um, you'd like

08:47.610 --> 08:50.280
to talk about it

08:50.322 --> 08:53.408
over dinner,

08:50.322 --> 08:53.408
Saturday night?

08:53.450 --> 08:55.118
Yeah, that will be nice.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.788
Great. See you then.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.719
Steph, Nelson will be here

09:10.800 --> 09:12.719
any second.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.554
How do I look?

09:14.595 --> 09:17.182
Like you're going out

09:14.595 --> 09:17.182
with a million bucks.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.351
What is this,

09:17.224 --> 09:19.351
uh, three nights in a row

09:19.393 --> 09:21.602
for you two wacky kids?

09:21.644 --> 09:22.979
Yeah.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.939
It's starting

09:23.021 --> 09:24.939
to feel kinda comfortable.

09:24.981 --> 09:28.235
Like a big couch

09:28.276 --> 09:30.195
It's not the money.

You know,

09:30.237 --> 09:32.155

09:32.197 --> 09:34.157

09:34.199 --> 09:37.035
He's so sweet,

09:34.199 --> 09:37.035
and sensitive, and..

09:37.077 --> 09:39.704
I could never talk to Viper

09:37.077 --> 09:39.704
the way I talk to him.

09:39.746 --> 09:40.747
[knock on door]

09:40.788 --> 09:42.374
That's him.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.169
Hi, Nels..

09:44.625 --> 09:46.169
Viper?

09:46.211 --> 09:47.670
D.J., I've been walking

09:46.211 --> 09:47.670
around for three days

09:47.712 --> 09:49.381
just thinking about you.

09:49.423 --> 09:50.673
And I realized that

09:49.423 --> 09:50.673
breaking up with you

09:50.715 --> 09:52.884
is the dumbest thing I ever did.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.345
Please, take me back.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.724
Take you back?

09:59.766 --> 10:02.477
There is no way

09:59.766 --> 10:02.477
D.J. is taking you back.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.647
You-you're not gonna

10:04.479 --> 10:06.647
take him back, are ya?

10:18.868 --> 10:21.121
- Deej, come on, we gotta talk.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.121
- No, no, not tonight.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.789
We're going out.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.499
You, on the other hand, are not

10:22.830 --> 10:24.499
going out. You're staying in.

10:24.541 --> 10:29.588
You...wanted your space.

10:24.541 --> 10:29.588

10:29.629 --> 10:33.216
This is better than "90210."

10:33.258 --> 10:35.176
Sorry, Viper, we're late.

10:37.137 --> 10:41.433
Gee! I don't believe this.

10:37.137 --> 10:41.433
What does she see in that guy?

10:41.475 --> 10:46.229
Well, let's see, she sees, uh,

10:41.475 --> 10:46.229
sensitivity. She sees caring.

10:46.271 --> 10:49.232
She sees a beach house

10:46.271 --> 10:49.232

10:49.274 --> 10:51.901
Well, I'm not rolling over

10:49.274 --> 10:51.901

10:51.943 --> 10:53.861
I'm getting D.J. back.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.996
Thanks, Nelson,

11:00.785 --> 11:02.996

11:07.584 --> 11:10.670
Dinner? Oh, no, thanks.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.670

11:13.340 --> 11:15.883
Deej, I know you've been

11:13.340 --> 11:15.883

uh, Viper.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.349
You know it's Viper.

11:22.390 --> 11:25.310
And I really cared about him.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.270
And I really care about you.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.732
Man, and I thought

11:28.771 --> 11:31.732
trigonometry was complicated.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.821
Look, Deej,

11:33.734 --> 11:36.821
I just want you to know..

11:36.863 --> 11:38.739
...I'm here for you.

11:38.781 --> 11:39.991
Well, actually

18:20.934 --> 18:23.185
a song for you or sing it to you

D.J., how can you compare

20:04.745 --> 20:06.622
buying a love song

20:06.664 --> 20:08.082
to writing one

Hey, hey,

knows who really loves her.
