00:21.960 --> 00:25.646

We should postpone our war.

its capacity to create financial chaos

Also, our friend jimmy McCavern

14:08.920 --> 14:13.801
has asked for control of the racecourses
north of Wincanton.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.844
I decided it is a trifling thing,
considering our new enterprise,

14:16.960 --> 14:20.169

14:22.760 --> 14:25.047

14:25.160 --> 14:26.924
No return.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.565
None.

14:34.080 --> 14:38.483
When our campaign begins, the country
will be divided into distinct areas.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.683
McCavern and his men
will be our soldiers in the north,

14:41.800 --> 14:44.167

- Were they Italian?
- Irish.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.085
Irish, I think...

36:18.200 --> 36:19.565
Oh, fuck.

36:19.680 --> 36:21.762
Fuck! Charlie,

36:21.880 --> 36:23.166

36:23.280 --> 36:24.520
Give it up, that's it.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.608
Listen. Listen to me.

36:26.720 --> 36:28.688
They're Titanic boys out there, right?

36:28.800 --> 36:30.370
They're out of Poplar.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.926
In the war, they were very capable.

36:33.040 --> 36:34.849
Very capable soldiers.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.689
So was I.

36:36.800 --> 36:39.326
I was a fucking capable soldier, too.

36:40.640 --> 36:44.406
Hey! Hey, you fucking bastards!

Purest ever in Europe.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.521
Arthur?

38:10.640 --> 38:12.927
There's a dead man in a copper's uniform.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.610
Should I throw him in the cut?

38:15.960 --> 38:17.246
No.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.442
No, he'll float, won't he, eh?

38:19.560 --> 38:21.801
Even Irishmen fucking float.

38:22.920 --> 38:26.720
No, go and fire...go and fire the kilns.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.729
But there are men working them.

38:29.840 --> 38:33.686
Why do you carry a gun, Isiah, eh?

38:33.800 --> 38:35.404
And razor blades in your cap?

38:37.320 --> 38:39.800
Cos you're a Peaky fucking Blinder,
that's why.

38:39.920 --> 38:43.163
You take that body
and you burn it to the bone.

38:44.160 --> 38:46.606
And if anybody speaks to you on that...

38:47.560 --> 38:50.928
...you offer them the chance
to burn in that furnace with him.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.280
Right?

38:53.400 --> 38:54.561
Yes, Arthur.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.809
Yeah. Yeah.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.890

who tried to trick us?

39:02.000 --> 39:03.206

all of them, right?

39:08.760 --> 39:13.687

39:18.640 --> 39:20.324
Yeah! Now look,

39:20.440 --> 39:22.727
the Titanic heard about this, right?

39:22.840 --> 39:27.209
That means every gang from Poplar
to Birmingham will want to be here.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.404
Well, let 'em come, eh?

39:30.520 --> 39:33.000

Yeah.

Did you fuck her before me?
Because whoever did

46:59.480 --> 47:01.767
gave me the fucking clap.
But I'm guessing it was you.

47:01.880 --> 47:04.121
- Yes, I fucked her before you did!
- Yeah.

- She was.

She was.

by members of the Titanic,

50:56.800 --> 50:59.041

50:59.160 --> 51:01.322
Mr Mosley is open to suggestion

51:01.440 --> 51:04.250
regarding who he can rely on
to offer him support in London.

51:05.480 --> 51:09.883
Well, I would suggest the most competent
organiser of men in the south...

51:10.000 --> 51:11.923
...is Alfie Solomons.

51:12.040 --> 51:14.042
(LAUGHS) He's dead.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.365
And he's Jewish!

51:18.360 --> 51:20.966
And I'd say as far as
our boss is concerned,

51:21.080 --> 51:24.482
him being dead would be less
of an obstacle than him being Jewish.

51:25.880 --> 51:28.326
I think he'll give London to the Italians.

51:28.440 --> 51:30.602
He likes Italians.

51:31.960 --> 51:34.088
That'll mean more concessions
on your part,

51:34.200 --> 51:37.204

to accept it, tinker boy.

- Yeah, I heard.

While he's on stage.

54:29.120 --> 54:30.884
While I'm stood next to him.

54:32.480 --> 54:35.290
And then I will take over
as leader of the party...

54:36.320 --> 54:39.722
...and you and Aberama can take care
of that bastard McCavern.

54:41.400 --> 54:45.121
I had more complicated strategies in mind
for Mr Mosley.

54:46.120 --> 54:47.281
Then he spoke badly

54:47.400 --> 54:48.765
to my wife.

54:50.400 --> 54:52.641
It's going to be
a busy few weeks, brother.

54:52.760 --> 54:53.966
Yeah.
