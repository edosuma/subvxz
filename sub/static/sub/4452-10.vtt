00:01.000 --> 00:02.212
Previously on Cedar Cove...

00:02.242 --> 00:03.865
The people that you hit called me.

00:03.896 --> 00:04.922
They are lying.

00:04.953 --> 00:06.240
What do you think of Eddie Wilson?

00:06.270 --> 00:08.523
- For me?
- Well, your old position is open now.

00:08.736 --> 00:09.801
I think I love you.

00:10.668 --> 00:12.934
- You are a liability.
- Are you firing me?

00:13.365 --> 00:14.528
Let's move in together.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074

00:29.284 --> 00:32.076
- Oh, man, you've got a lot of stuff, Jack.
- No, he doesn't.

00:32.106 --> 00:33.753
I'm surprised Olivia's
head hasn't exploded.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.757
You know, "Order in all things,"
just like Dad.

00:35.788 --> 00:37.158
You need to get going.

00:37.188 --> 00:39.167
The meeting with the
people whose car you hit?

00:39.599 --> 00:40.674
Don't be late.

00:40.704 --> 00:42.420
You know what, you're sounding
more and more like mom.

00:43.838 --> 00:45.227
You know, as soon as
I get the car situation

00:45.408 --> 00:47.814
taken care of, next up is
a place for him to live.

00:47.915 --> 00:48.472
Uh-huh.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.189
Listen, I'm sorry about the boxes.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.921
Jack, don't be.

00:54.025 --> 00:55.610
You know, I want you to
feel like this is your home.

00:57.170 --> 00:59.059
Can we put a pool table
here in the living room?

01:00.425 --> 01:02.539
- You're joking.
- Yes.

01:04.396 --> 01:06.520
I'll get these unpacked
as soon as I can, okay?

01:07.440 --> 01:09.043
- I can do it.
- What?

01:09.204 --> 01:09.862
Yeah.

01:10.022 --> 01:11.520
I don't have to be to court till later,

01:11.598 --> 01:13.536
and I've got a really
light day on the docket.

01:13.891 --> 01:15.373
I would love to help you.

01:15.404 --> 01:17.195
No, you don't have to do that.

01:17.225 --> 01:18.426
I want to.

01:18.457 --> 01:18.932
Aw...

01:18.962 --> 01:20.231
Thank you.

01:23.793 --> 01:24.937
Have you seen my key?

01:26.999 --> 01:27.832
No.

01:29.711 --> 01:30.890
Got it.

01:30.920 --> 01:31.426
See ya.

01:32.772 --> 01:33.677
Bye, Will.

01:35.570 --> 01:37.134
Oh, boy.

01:38.987 --> 01:40.603
So, what do you think?

01:40.634 --> 01:42.493
A choir?

01:42.523 --> 01:45.798
Releasing of doves, a
sit-down five-course meal,

01:45.829 --> 01:46.894
and a live band?

01:46.924 --> 01:48.369
Five groomsmen?

01:48.399 --> 01:49.558
Well, they have to match the bridesmaids,

01:49.589 --> 01:51.036
and I have a lot of friends.

01:51.481 --> 01:54.636
Honey, it's not a wedding,
it's a spectacle.

01:54.666 --> 01:56.254
You're the one who wanted
the whole town there.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.182
And I still do.

01:57.212 --> 01:58.852
Every person.

01:58.882 --> 02:00.336
Maybe at the ranch.

02:00.366 --> 02:02.157
But less, way, way less stuff.

02:02.188 --> 02:04.232
Okay, hold on here.

02:04.262 --> 02:06.171
We are days before the wedding,

02:06.201 --> 02:07.318
and now you're saying

02:07.349 --> 02:09.815
you want us to get married in a barn?

02:09.845 --> 02:10.987
I'm a simple man, Grace.

02:11.166 --> 02:13.626
You're the one who said I
could plan any wedding I wanted.

02:13.656 --> 02:16.070
Yes, but it should still feel like us.

02:16.101 --> 02:18.178
We're not doves and a choir.

02:18.577 --> 02:19.596
Honey...

02:25.809 --> 02:27.409
I like the doves.

02:31.176 --> 02:33.775
We're thinking about having a
party this weekend, at the house.

02:34.184 --> 02:36.413
You know, cheer Rebecca up
with the whole job situation.

02:37.212 --> 02:38.436
Yeah, I don't think I can make it.

02:38.616 --> 02:39.386
Oh.

02:39.417 --> 02:40.992
Busy weekend?

02:41.618 --> 02:44.446
Uh, yeah, I was thinking about
taking off for a few days.

02:44.477 --> 02:46.318
Oh, okay.

02:46.348 --> 02:48.038
Where to?

02:48.068 --> 02:50.399
I'm not sure.

02:50.430 --> 02:52.812
Well, maybe I can come with.

02:52.842 --> 02:54.177
Yeah, that'd be great,

02:54.207 --> 02:55.728
but I don't know, I'd like to be alone.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.584
Oh.

02:57.614 --> 02:59.928
Yeah, just something I need to do.

02:59.958 --> 03:00.922
Alone.

03:00.953 --> 03:02.086
Yeah.

03:02.117 --> 03:03.673
You okay with that?

03:03.703 --> 03:06.398
- Yeah.
- All right.

03:32.463 --> 03:34.232
So, each one of these
on the top here, and...

03:34.262 --> 03:36.426
The notary is coming this afternoon.

03:36.622 --> 03:38.888
Warren is signing over his
half of Charlotte's house.

03:39.546 --> 03:40.624
It's the right thing to do.

03:40.654 --> 03:41.855
He's doubling his money.

03:42.053 --> 03:43.464
Like I said, Dad, it's
the right thing to do.

03:43.495 --> 03:45.987
Speaking of which, just wondering
when you're going to give me back

03:46.017 --> 03:47.657
my signatory privileges.

03:47.687 --> 03:49.242
Paperwork gets done, money changes hands,

03:49.272 --> 03:50.759
then I'll see how I feel.

03:50.789 --> 03:52.615
- You don't trust me.
- I do.

03:52.645 --> 03:55.616
I trust you to stab me in the back
the first chance you get.

03:58.553 --> 04:02.464
What are you doing?

04:02.494 --> 04:04.875
He thinks he's got me over a barrel.

04:04.905 --> 04:06.646
He does have you over a barrel.

04:06.676 --> 04:07.995
He thinks he's won.

04:08.026 --> 04:09.614
Because he has.

04:09.644 --> 04:10.879
Which is why he's walking around all cocky

04:10.910 --> 04:12.616
and full of himself.

04:12.647 --> 04:14.542
Because he has you over
a barrel, and he's won.

04:14.572 --> 04:16.022
So, he's gonna loosen up and relax,

04:16.245 --> 04:17.584
and when he's not looking, bam!

04:17.695 --> 04:19.339
What, you're gonna yell at him?

04:19.531 --> 04:21.337
No, Alex, no, I'm gonna double-cross him,

04:21.470 --> 04:23.277
and I'm gonna kick him
out of my company for good.

04:23.308 --> 04:25.766
Because, you see,
smarts will only get you so far,

04:25.956 --> 04:28.264
and luck will always run out.

04:31.798 --> 04:34.157
Are you talking about Buck, or you?

04:41.995 --> 04:44.961
Grace, thank you so much
for helping with all this.

04:44.991 --> 04:48.334
Yes, well, my help does not come free.

04:48.365 --> 04:49.785
Name your price.

04:49.815 --> 04:51.302
Will you marry Cliff and me?

04:51.333 --> 04:52.011
Grace...

04:52.041 --> 04:53.461
Aw, I would be honored.

04:56.752 --> 04:58.319
Would you look at this?

04:58.349 --> 05:00.073
Jack was valedictorian.

05:01.829 --> 05:03.443
Well, you always knew he was smart.

05:03.480 --> 05:04.521
But I didn't know that.

05:04.715 --> 05:07.841
I don't really think you know anyone
until you share space with them.

05:08.243 --> 05:10.889
Dan and I were in high school together,

05:10.919 --> 05:12.238
and then college,

05:12.268 --> 05:13.519
and then when we got married,

05:13.550 --> 05:14.953
and it was like I didn't even know him,

05:14.983 --> 05:18.238
Dan just made it his mission
to hide things from me,

05:18.269 --> 05:20.360
- and that is not Jack.
- I know.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.420
Oh...

05:23.450 --> 05:24.765
He was in the Peace Corps.

05:24.795 --> 05:25.390
What?

05:25.421 --> 05:27.025
Oh, wow.

05:29.842 --> 05:31.485
Yeah, apparently, he's a pack rat, too.

05:33.023 --> 05:34.726
Oh! Lookie here.

05:34.946 --> 05:36.146
And he scuba dives.

05:38.053 --> 05:39.994
Jack didn't tell me about any of this.

05:42.563 --> 05:45.766
I think...

05:45.796 --> 05:49.291
I think you crave intimacy and sharing

05:49.321 --> 05:51.836
from a man who finds both of those things

05:51.867 --> 05:53.658
very uncomfortable.

05:53.689 --> 05:54.906
And where does that leave me?

05:54.936 --> 05:57.774
- Right where I am.
- Which is?

05:57.804 --> 06:00.033
I got so caught up in the whole drama

06:00.063 --> 06:02.529
and excitement of getting engaged,

06:02.559 --> 06:04.721
and then breaking up,
then getting re-engaged,

06:04.752 --> 06:06.745
that I totally lost sight of the fact

06:06.776 --> 06:09.162
that Cliff and I are two
wildly different people.

06:09.320 --> 06:10.714
Who love each other.

06:10.874 --> 06:11.652
Yeah,

06:11.682 --> 06:14.603
but can two people who only have
love in common be soulmates?

06:21.454 --> 06:23.189
Oh, I see.

06:23.219 --> 06:26.815
So you called me here to work on my
own house-warming present, is that it?

06:26.845 --> 06:28.434
Finish, I did all the hard work.

06:28.464 --> 06:30.457
Oh, I see.

06:30.488 --> 06:32.245
How is your new job coming along?

06:33.208 --> 06:35.501
My boss is forcing

06:35.531 --> 06:39.463
this under-qualified 10-year-old kid
on me to be my second at the paper.

06:39.494 --> 06:41.508
His name is Eddie.

06:41.538 --> 06:43.024
I mean, the kid's just
gotten out of school.

06:43.225 --> 06:45.467
- And he's up for your old job?
- I know, right?

06:45.498 --> 06:47.357
I was Jeri's second.

06:47.387 --> 06:49.254
I need someone as skillful
as me in that position.

06:49.405 --> 06:50.881
I can't run this paper on my own.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.086
So, what are you going to do?

06:52.116 --> 06:55.233
Well, I guess I'm going to have to placate
my boss and give this kid an interview.

06:55.263 --> 06:56.210
Is that going to work?

06:56.640 --> 06:57.792
Well, it's going to have to.

06:58.354 --> 06:59.667
Hey, Paul!

06:59.698 --> 07:01.928
Hey, guys.

07:01.958 --> 07:04.070
- Just off to court?
- Yeah.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.165
Nice bench.

07:05.196 --> 07:06.178
Yeah, it is.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.358
Love seat.

07:07.389 --> 07:09.956
And it's a work of art.

07:09.986 --> 07:13.632
Two kinds of wood that are stronger
together than by themselves,

07:13.662 --> 07:16.111
and the mortise and
tenon are within the wood,

07:16.142 --> 07:18.017
- so no bolts or screws.
- For Peggy?

07:18.048 --> 07:19.805
No, Jack.

07:19.835 --> 07:20.901
Housewarming.

07:20.932 --> 07:22.864
Yeah, Olivia and Jack moved in together.

07:23.686 --> 07:25.842
Oh!

07:25.873 --> 07:27.023
Nice.

07:27.054 --> 07:28.372
It is.

07:28.402 --> 07:29.907
Well, congratulations.

07:30.852 --> 07:31.662
Thank you.

07:31.845 --> 07:32.609
Yeah.

07:33.231 --> 07:34.264
Um...

07:35.295 --> 07:36.973
- I'm off.
- All right.

07:38.493 --> 07:39.976
Nice to see you two getting along.

07:40.810 --> 07:43.909
Well, now that Paul is no longer a threat.

07:45.012 --> 07:45.724
Bob...

07:46.624 --> 07:48.039
Paul was never a threat.

07:52.154 --> 07:53.619
You told him you loved him?

07:53.649 --> 07:55.019
I did.

07:55.049 --> 07:56.115
And now he's leaving?

07:56.146 --> 07:57.768
Yeah.

07:57.799 --> 07:59.876
- 'Cause you told him you loved him.
- He said it first.

07:59.907 --> 08:01.327
Doesn't matter.

08:01.357 --> 08:02.564
When you said it, you made it real.

08:02.595 --> 08:03.604
He's spooked.

08:03.634 --> 08:05.577
He's an ex Navy Seal.

08:05.607 --> 08:07.348
He doesn't spook.

08:07.378 --> 08:09.725
Um, commitment spooks all men.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.749
How do you know?

08:11.780 --> 08:13.875
Research.

08:13.905 --> 08:15.359
Research from fashion magazines?

08:15.389 --> 08:17.382
It's still research.

08:17.412 --> 08:19.372
Oh, good,

08:19.403 --> 08:20.468
Paul changed his mind.

08:20.499 --> 08:22.341
- You got your job back?
- No.

08:23.331 --> 08:24.482
I'm fine, by the way.

08:24.513 --> 08:26.759
Stop looking at me like that.

08:26.789 --> 08:28.918
This has actually been really great.

08:28.949 --> 08:31.220
I never have time to
do anything for myself.

08:31.250 --> 08:33.739
I organized my closet,
cleaned out my spam folder,

08:33.910 --> 08:34.890
ironed my sheets,

08:34.921 --> 08:37.283
- detailed my car...
- You iron your sheets?

08:37.313 --> 08:38.599
How else do you get the
perfect crease in them?

08:38.629 --> 08:40.756
Take them out of the package.

08:40.787 --> 08:43.049
You did all that? It's not even 9:00 a.m.

08:43.081 --> 08:45.074
And I have several job interviews lined up,

08:45.105 --> 08:47.616
- so wish me luck.
- Good luck!

08:48.416 --> 08:50.438
She needs a job.

08:50.469 --> 08:53.149
Yeah, our sanity depends on it.

09:02.850 --> 09:03.975
Dad!

09:04.249 --> 09:05.859
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.368
Okay, so be honest...

09:11.398 --> 09:12.582
Okay.

09:12.612 --> 09:14.285
Is it too much?

09:14.316 --> 09:15.365
The doves?

09:15.395 --> 09:17.793
No, the wedding.

09:17.823 --> 09:19.344
It's not too much, it's you.

09:19.375 --> 09:20.660
Yeah, but it's not Cliff.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.312
But he knows who you are.

09:22.343 --> 09:24.624
I thought he did.

09:24.654 --> 09:26.529
Most guys like simple things.

09:26.559 --> 09:27.624
John's like that.

09:27.655 --> 09:28.687
Oh... How is he?

09:28.718 --> 09:31.268
He's, um...

09:31.299 --> 09:33.726
still in New York.

09:34.137 --> 09:35.989
I got asked out the other day.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.592
Yeah?

09:37.623 --> 09:38.951
Someone I met on the ferry.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.489
- What'd you say?
- I didn't know what to say.

09:41.519 --> 09:42.551
I don't know what I am.

09:42.581 --> 09:44.646
Single? Together? Broken up?

09:45.022 --> 09:46.033
Honey, you're in limbo.

09:46.907 --> 09:48.226
And I don't like it..

09:54.021 --> 09:56.548
- You really think Gloria is dangerous?
- I do.

09:56.579 --> 09:57.898
Instinct.

09:57.928 --> 09:59.550
Something's just not right.

10:00.820 --> 10:02.008
I'll be careful.

10:03.084 --> 10:04.639
Honey, I think you should move back home.

10:05.239 --> 10:06.608
No. I told you before.

10:06.799 --> 10:07.852
I am home.

10:08.410 --> 10:11.087
- And everything is gonna be okay.
- How can you be so sure?

10:11.278 --> 10:13.732
Because you have never let
anything bad happen to me before.

10:14.325 --> 10:15.407
Ever.

10:21.410 --> 10:23.264
Mr. Watson!

10:23.294 --> 10:25.224
Judge Lockhart.

10:25.254 --> 10:27.726
I believe you are gonna be
seeing a lot of me this week.

10:27.756 --> 10:28.841
I'll have to cope.

10:29.105 --> 10:30.535
Yeah, until I get a new ADA,

10:30.566 --> 10:33.450
I'm going to be handling all of
Rebecca's motions and appearances.

10:33.481 --> 10:35.693
Or, until you hire her back?

10:35.723 --> 10:37.059
Don't think so.

10:37.089 --> 10:38.442
She needs you to help her.

10:38.472 --> 10:41.190
So you tell me, but she
won't let me help her.

10:41.221 --> 10:42.725
You need to teach her how to take help.

10:42.756 --> 10:44.497
I'm a D.A., not a career counselor.

10:44.527 --> 10:45.796
You could be both.

10:45.826 --> 10:47.111
I could, actually.

10:48.241 --> 10:49.894
- Alex...
- Hey!

10:50.188 --> 10:52.922
I have to meet the Saget attorney
at the clerk's office, so...

10:54.692 --> 10:55.768
Have a good day.

10:58.513 --> 10:59.911
That was awkward.

10:59.942 --> 11:01.952
She's probably embarrassed.

11:01.982 --> 11:04.819
This is when living in a small town
is not so great.

11:04.849 --> 11:06.978
That's the third time today I've seen her.

11:07.008 --> 11:08.546
It's hard to put your heart out there.

11:08.576 --> 11:10.654
It's a gamble.

11:10.685 --> 11:12.341
I have not been lucky in that department.

11:12.371 --> 11:13.690
Luck can change.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.713
Yes, it can.

11:15.744 --> 11:16.624
Oh, uh, Anthony's in town today.

11:16.655 --> 11:18.091
Oh?

11:18.122 --> 11:19.492
Yeah. Yeah, we have a meeting.

11:19.522 --> 11:22.156
- Well, please, tell him I said hello.
- I will.

11:22.186 --> 11:23.908
Do you think he wants his job back?

11:23.980 --> 11:25.363
That's what the meeting is about.

11:25.542 --> 11:27.178
Anyway, I'm late, I've gotta go, sorry.

11:39.502 --> 11:41.136
Well, he's originally from Philly.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.026
He's a sports reporter.

11:43.056 --> 11:44.611
Was a sports reporter.

11:44.641 --> 11:45.471
Jack.

11:45.502 --> 11:46.990
David.

11:47.020 --> 11:48.423
This is Eddie,

11:48.453 --> 11:50.384
and as I said,

11:50.415 --> 11:52.035
I think he'll make a great number two.

11:52.613 --> 11:53.743
Hey, I'm a big fan.

11:55.239 --> 11:56.316
Did we have a time set up.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.373
Eddie and I were having
a breakfast meeting,

11:58.404 --> 12:00.060
and I was telling him
about the job, and you,

12:00.090 --> 12:02.050
and I thought I'd just bring
him around to meet you.

12:02.080 --> 12:04.579
- Didn't know you'd be late.
- I'm not late.

12:04.610 --> 12:05.116
I'm in charge, so I can't be late.

12:05.593 --> 12:06.941
I'm in charge, so I can't be late.

12:06.971 --> 12:07.953
He's a smart guy,

12:07.983 --> 12:09.200
and talented,

12:09.230 --> 12:10.549
and he's got some good ideas

12:10.580 --> 12:12.843
on how to engage the
20-somethings in written news.

12:12.874 --> 12:15.003
That's great.

12:15.033 --> 12:17.262
I'll leave you two to it.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.692
Please, sit.

12:22.578 --> 12:24.297
I'm glad you could meet me.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.709
Yeah... Yeah, me too.

12:26.739 --> 12:29.828
Look, I have offers
at two other papers,

12:29.859 --> 12:31.772
one national blog, and a local TV station.

12:31.878 --> 12:34.726
David doesn't want to lose me,
so that's why we're meeting.

12:34.756 --> 12:36.362
And you want to be my number two?

12:36.393 --> 12:38.352
I have to be completely upfront with you.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.040
I don't do assignments,

12:40.070 --> 12:42.594
and I'm not comfortable
with hard deadlines.

12:42.624 --> 12:45.106
Well, deadlines and news go together.

12:45.136 --> 12:47.265
And I like to pick my own stories.

12:47.296 --> 12:47.822
And you'll be able to do that...

12:47.852 --> 12:49.391
someday...

12:49.421 --> 12:51.025
when you're in charge of your own paper.

12:51.056 --> 12:53.947
Hey, no disrespect, Jack,
but unlike your generation,

12:54.130 --> 12:55.868
my generation isn't
tied to money and power.

12:55.898 --> 12:57.125
We're the generation of truth,

12:57.344 --> 12:59.287
and truth is only
attainable through passion.

12:59.317 --> 13:02.157
Passion can't be assigned, Jack,
it has to be found.

13:02.187 --> 13:04.636
And so, that's a non-negotiable for me.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.509
You're not negotiating,

13:06.539 --> 13:08.195
you're interviewing,

13:08.225 --> 13:10.100
for a job that you're
not qualified to hold,

13:10.131 --> 13:12.265
so you might want to
dial back the attitude...

13:12.588 --> 13:13.685
just a little bit.

13:14.606 --> 13:15.968
And no disrespect,

13:16.022 --> 13:20.292
but the attitude adjustment
is non-negotiable for me.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.870
All right, I just want it on record

13:25.900 --> 13:28.703
that I am here on time, and they are late.

13:28.733 --> 13:30.575
I just want to remind you
that you wrecked my car.

13:30.605 --> 13:32.766
Judge Lockhart?

13:32.797 --> 13:34.926
Hi. Yes, please, come on in.

13:34.956 --> 13:36.609
Thanks for meeting with us.

13:36.773 --> 13:38.209
Yes, please, have a seat.

13:42.332 --> 13:43.511
We think we can settle this

13:43.541 --> 13:45.282
without the insurance companies.

13:45.312 --> 13:47.440
I'm fine with leaving it
with our insurance companies.

13:47.470 --> 13:49.312
Well, we'd rather deal with
a person than a company.

13:49.342 --> 13:49.851
We added up everything it's gonna cost

13:49.882 --> 13:50.947
to fix our car.

13:57.712 --> 14:00.004
That's a lot of money.

14:00.034 --> 14:02.787
And uh... what's this?

14:02.817 --> 14:04.288
Pain and suffering.

14:04.319 --> 14:05.553
My brother-in-law is a lawyer,

14:05.583 --> 14:06.514
said that was standard.

14:06.545 --> 14:07.746
Here's the deal.

14:07.776 --> 14:10.022
Their car was parked,

14:10.052 --> 14:11.506
I lightly touched the bumper.

14:11.536 --> 14:13.143
There was no one was in
the car. I left a note.

14:13.174 --> 14:14.036
We were in the car.

14:14.067 --> 14:15.230
He hit us and then drove off.

14:15.412 --> 14:16.936
- They're lying.
- We aren't.

14:17.130 --> 14:18.327
See?

14:19.704 --> 14:20.732
We saw it happen,

14:20.763 --> 14:22.953
and then snapped this picture
as your brother drove away.

14:22.983 --> 14:24.577
Will.

14:24.607 --> 14:26.853
I need some time to review this.

14:26.884 --> 14:28.270
Of course.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.635
Why don't you give us a call

14:29.815 --> 14:32.076
when you've had a chance to
read through the proposal?

14:32.548 --> 14:34.239
We think it's fair.

14:34.269 --> 14:36.435
- I will.
- Thank you.

14:36.829 --> 14:37.742
Thank you.

14:45.070 --> 14:46.674
There is nothing to review.

14:46.844 --> 14:47.867
They're lying.

14:47.897 --> 14:49.130
It's your word against theirs.

14:49.161 --> 14:50.248
Why won't you believe me?

14:52.693 --> 14:54.546
I really love your hoodie.

14:54.576 --> 14:55.726
Where did you get it?

14:55.757 --> 14:57.244
Warriors In Pink.

14:57.274 --> 14:58.896
It's Ford's campaign to raise awareness

14:58.927 --> 15:00.348
in the fight against breast cancer.

15:00.379 --> 15:01.384
Yeah, I've heard of them.

15:01.575 --> 15:02.983
They do really good work.

15:03.082 --> 15:05.630
- Where did you hear about them?
- Alice.

15:05.661 --> 15:07.758
Alice Taylor who moved to
Seattle three years back?

15:07.925 --> 15:08.675
Yeah.

15:08.705 --> 15:09.522
Is she...

15:09.694 --> 15:10.899
She had surgery a year ago,

15:10.929 --> 15:12.307
and just finished all her treatments.

15:12.499 --> 15:14.093
But it's her year anniversary,

15:14.124 --> 15:16.115
- and she's doing great.
- I had no idea.

15:16.146 --> 15:17.356
So many people don't have the help,

15:17.551 --> 15:18.303
or resources they need,

15:18.333 --> 15:19.877
or the friends and family.

15:19.907 --> 15:22.169
- Alice was really lucky.
- She was.

15:22.759 --> 15:24.221
I wish we could do more to help.

15:24.419 --> 15:25.277
Yeah.

15:31.077 --> 15:33.065
Just the usual, Moon.

15:33.096 --> 15:34.701
And by the way, Moon,

15:34.732 --> 15:36.034
you can spare me the words of wisdom.

15:36.064 --> 15:37.298
Coffee will be fine.

15:37.329 --> 15:38.833
Excuse me?

15:38.863 --> 15:39.932
Remember when you told me

15:39.962 --> 15:42.444
that my dad needed to be
pulled in a different direction

15:42.620 --> 15:43.915
in order to get out of
my business and my life?

15:43.945 --> 15:44.562
Remember that?

15:44.741 --> 15:45.843
Yeah, Moon, that was bad advice.

15:45.873 --> 15:47.603
You see, I've pulled and pulled,

15:47.633 --> 15:49.560
and he is entrenched more in my life now

15:49.590 --> 15:51.252
than the day you gave me
that lame advice, so...

15:51.439 --> 15:52.563
You're doing it wrong.

15:53.069 --> 15:54.922
Really? How so?

15:54.953 --> 15:56.103
I used to have this little dog.

15:56.133 --> 15:58.480
He was tiny, but steadfast,

15:58.511 --> 16:00.758
and you could never
push him to do anything.

16:00.789 --> 16:02.040
I had to give him treats

16:02.070 --> 16:04.752
to pull him from one location to another.

16:07.203 --> 16:10.186
Do I have to spell it out for you?

16:10.216 --> 16:12.597
No, I just would prefer
it if you made some sense.

16:12.627 --> 16:14.638
You need to find something that Buck wants

16:14.668 --> 16:16.999
that is far, far away from Cedar Cove,

16:17.030 --> 16:19.606
and Buck will follow that
treat all the way out of town.

16:20.977 --> 16:23.653
Man, Buck must have really made you angry.

16:25.248 --> 16:29.840
When he moved into Charlotte's,
he bought an espresso machine.

16:30.464 --> 16:33.780
I cannot let such a bold act of aggression
against Moon's go unchallenged.

16:33.810 --> 16:35.668
What if everyone were to do it?

16:35.699 --> 16:37.625
You are one weird dude, man.

16:37.655 --> 16:40.854
Proudly defending my establishment
one cup of coffee at a time.

16:45.966 --> 16:47.276
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

16:54.003 --> 16:56.148
Well, the Ladies Who Lunch.

16:56.493 --> 16:58.624
It's nice to see women
"leaning out" for a change.

17:00.130 --> 17:01.705
- I hate that guy.
- Get in line.

17:01.881 --> 17:02.949
I still think he's cute.

17:04.577 --> 17:05.704
Sorry.

17:05.736 --> 17:07.898
- You're not.
- I'm not.

17:08.962 --> 17:10.444
How's your day going?

17:10.474 --> 17:12.349
I've been thinking...

17:12.380 --> 17:14.661
I think I need to take
a break from the law.

17:14.691 --> 17:15.638
Yeah?

17:15.670 --> 17:17.174
Yeah.

17:17.204 --> 17:20.007
I just need to simplify my life.

17:20.038 --> 17:21.406
I could work here.

17:21.436 --> 17:24.045
I don't think that customer
service is your thing.

17:24.940 --> 17:26.439
You scare people.

17:28.541 --> 17:30.412
I could start a business.

17:30.817 --> 17:31.916
That's a great idea.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.174
- I could start a day care.
- No.

17:37.296 --> 17:38.863
Or...

17:38.893 --> 17:41.106
you could try calling your boss.

17:41.136 --> 17:43.045
He didn't fire you, just suspended.

17:43.075 --> 17:44.985
He doesn't understand or respect me.

17:45.015 --> 17:46.637
I can't just be suspended.

17:46.668 --> 17:48.021
I need to do something.

17:49.523 --> 17:50.602
It's time to move on.

17:51.462 --> 17:52.084
And...

17:56.016 --> 17:58.038
What are we doing here?

17:58.068 --> 17:58.965
We could have the wedding here!

17:58.995 --> 18:00.128
At the courthouse?

18:00.159 --> 18:01.428
Yeah!

18:01.458 --> 18:03.030
We'll make it beautiful,

18:03.060 --> 18:05.306
but simple.

18:05.337 --> 18:08.224
Cliff, I don't want to
get married "simple."

18:08.254 --> 18:10.209
I don't want to get married in a circus.

18:10.381 --> 18:11.477
A circus?

18:11.507 --> 18:12.676
It's just too much, Grace.

18:12.706 --> 18:14.357
What's too much, Cliff,

18:14.528 --> 18:15.869
the wedding, or me?

18:21.445 --> 18:23.179
You know the file clerk
is in love with you.

18:23.209 --> 18:25.612
I'm very lovable.

18:25.643 --> 18:27.046
How was your meeting with Anthony?

18:27.076 --> 18:28.310
Oh, we had to push it to later.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.407
There was a problem with the ferry.

18:29.437 --> 18:30.891
So...

18:30.921 --> 18:32.037
How's Jack's moving in going?

18:32.068 --> 18:33.050
You heard?

18:33.080 --> 18:34.399
Bob.

18:34.429 --> 18:36.051
Bob...

18:36.082 --> 18:37.367
Yeah, to use an old newspaper phrase,

18:37.397 --> 18:39.496
you sort of buried the lede earlier,

18:39.526 --> 18:40.272
but mostly,

18:40.443 --> 18:42.651
I was surprised to hear about it from Bob.

18:42.845 --> 18:45.563
So, how's it going?

18:45.594 --> 18:48.533
Well, after unpacking all of Jack's stuff,

18:48.563 --> 18:51.921
I'm realizing how little I know about him.

18:51.951 --> 18:53.746
How much do we really know about anyone?

18:53.777 --> 18:54.897
What do you mean?

18:54.927 --> 18:57.253
Well, you can be with someone for 10 years,
and not really know their heart.

18:57.415 --> 18:59.025
- Objection.
- Basis?

18:59.226 --> 19:00.910
I haven't known you that long,

19:00.941 --> 19:02.631
and I know a lot about you.

19:02.662 --> 19:03.829
Oh, no, me,

19:03.859 --> 19:05.008
I'm a born over-sharer,

19:05.039 --> 19:06.679
I'm an open book,

19:06.709 --> 19:08.786
and, actually, the merging
of two people's stuff

19:08.817 --> 19:12.480
is often more complicated than
the merging of their hearts.

19:12.511 --> 19:14.572
So... what's your gut tell you?

19:14.602 --> 19:16.122
I love him.

19:16.471 --> 19:17.653
Then there's no problem.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.783
I'm sure when he asked you to move in,

19:19.813 --> 19:20.744
and you said yes,

19:20.775 --> 19:22.279
you made his day.

19:22.309 --> 19:24.522
I asked him.

19:24.552 --> 19:26.130
Excuse me?

19:26.309 --> 19:28.137
I asked Jack to move in with me.

19:29.010 --> 19:31.065
Oh. I'm so...

19:31.096 --> 19:32.179
I'm sorry.

19:32.209 --> 19:33.157
Oh! You know what,

19:33.187 --> 19:35.214
I just realized I have to
get back to the office.

19:35.245 --> 19:35.957
- Sorry.
- Right.

19:35.987 --> 19:37.238
Okay...

19:40.006 --> 19:40.814
Hmm.

19:50.063 --> 19:52.643
So, Eddie, he's a perfect fit, right?

19:53.130 --> 19:55.624
The job isn't an entry-level position.

19:55.655 --> 19:56.939
Eddie can handle it.

19:56.969 --> 19:58.491
Yeah, and when he doesn't?

19:58.521 --> 20:00.178
When he doesn't pull his own weight?

20:00.209 --> 20:01.695
Then I have to do his job and my job,

20:01.725 --> 20:02.976
which means, eventually,

20:03.007 --> 20:04.899
I'm not going to be doing my job very well.

20:04.930 --> 20:06.148
All right, look, I get it, David,

20:06.178 --> 20:08.205
you like the kid, you see promise in him,

20:08.235 --> 20:09.570
but I want Walker out of Metro, okay?

20:09.601 --> 20:11.883
He's strong, he's creative, he's seasoned.

20:11.913 --> 20:13.894
- He is a number two.
- Eddie's a gem.

20:13.924 --> 20:16.502
A year from now, we won't
be able to afford him.

20:16.533 --> 20:18.864
The kid doesn't take direction well,

20:18.894 --> 20:20.602
and I'm worried that he's
so focused on his own career,

20:20.633 --> 20:21.900
he's not going to be of any help.

20:21.930 --> 20:24.413
Plus, he wants to pick and
choose his own assignments.

20:24.443 --> 20:27.026
David, this is a paper,
okay, it's not a blog.

20:27.056 --> 20:28.882
Give him a try, as a favor.

20:28.912 --> 20:30.180
A trial run.

20:40.655 --> 20:41.681
Paul!

20:44.129 --> 20:45.780
Bob.

20:45.810 --> 20:47.770
You playing hooky?

20:47.800 --> 20:49.642
No, no, just left a file in my room,

20:49.673 --> 20:52.172
and I don't have an ADA to fetch it for me.

20:52.202 --> 20:53.774
Is that a new palm sander?

20:53.804 --> 20:55.764
Just came in the mail.

20:55.795 --> 20:56.895
Wow, nice. Can I...

20:56.925 --> 20:58.344
Yeah.

20:58.374 --> 21:00.874
Oh, fits in the hand, huh?

21:00.905 --> 21:01.988
Like a glove.

21:02.018 --> 21:03.348
Yeah.

21:03.916 --> 21:05.135
Want to take it for a spin?

21:06.321 --> 21:07.207
Maybe later.

21:09.882 --> 21:10.825
Hi and bye.

21:15.161 --> 21:18.346
Being nice to Paul?

21:18.377 --> 21:20.792
What are you up to, Bob Beldon?

21:20.822 --> 21:23.018
Well, henhouse is secure,

21:23.048 --> 21:24.552
the rooster is free to roam,

21:24.583 --> 21:26.037
and, well, I'm free to be friendly

21:26.067 --> 21:27.522
to said rooster.

21:29.193 --> 21:31.271
I think the wood dust in this place
is making you loopy.

21:44.371 --> 21:45.685
Hi.

21:45.716 --> 21:47.287
Hi.

21:47.317 --> 21:51.402
That's a nice surprise.

21:51.432 --> 21:52.532
Why do you want to go away?

21:52.562 --> 21:55.247
Uh, hi.

21:55.278 --> 21:57.052
Yeah, I'm not really up for small talk.

21:57.082 --> 21:59.497
Well, what are you up for?

21:59.527 --> 22:01.268
The fact that I told you I love you,

22:01.299 --> 22:02.888
and 48 hours later,

22:02.918 --> 22:05.299
you are taking off to
an undisclosed location

22:05.329 --> 22:06.817
for an undisclosed amount of time.

22:06.847 --> 22:10.107
- It's not about you, it's me.
- It affects me.

22:10.138 --> 22:11.387
I know.

22:11.418 --> 22:13.159
What's going on?

22:13.189 --> 22:14.322
I'm restless.

22:14.352 --> 22:15.873
- Restless?
- Yeah.

22:15.904 --> 22:16.951
I mean, before you,

22:16.982 --> 22:18.117
I never really stayed in one place,

22:18.147 --> 22:20.022
I always moved on.

22:20.053 --> 22:22.468
This is because I told you
I want to have kids someday.

22:22.498 --> 22:24.072
It's about everything.

22:25.634 --> 22:26.875
We don't have much in common.

22:26.905 --> 22:29.047
I love you, you love me.

22:30.447 --> 22:32.303
I need to clear my head.

22:32.469 --> 22:34.310
Well, be sure to me
know when it's all clear.

22:34.705 --> 22:36.921
Justine...

22:36.952 --> 22:39.464
- I'm trying to do the right thing.
- No, you're running away, Luke.

22:39.629 --> 22:41.596
At least own your actions.

22:45.726 --> 22:47.748
Okay, let's put Sanders' editorial first up

22:47.778 --> 22:49.435
on the main page,

22:49.466 --> 22:51.728
then the assault and
robbery at Green Lake Park

22:51.758 --> 22:53.836
pushes your overfishing
of the Columbia River

22:53.867 --> 22:55.321
to page two.

22:55.351 --> 22:57.092
That's a mistake.

22:57.122 --> 22:58.997
You know the first rule of news...

22:59.028 --> 23:00.903
If if bleeds, it leads,
but why not change that up,

23:00.933 --> 23:02.454
make our paper different?

23:02.485 --> 23:04.580
So, we would separate ourselves out

23:04.610 --> 23:06.617
by not putting sensational
news on the front page?

23:06.647 --> 23:10.583
No, we would help re-educate the public
on what to expect from a newspaper.

23:10.613 --> 23:11.814
This is a paper, not Where's Waldo.

23:11.845 --> 23:13.502
The most important and relevant information

23:13.532 --> 23:15.272
always goes on the front
page, and besides...

23:15.302 --> 23:17.936
Look, Eddie, your job,

23:17.967 --> 23:19.624
if you are to get this job as my second,

23:19.654 --> 23:21.242
is to make my job easier, okay?

23:21.272 --> 23:23.864
This conversation, not
making my job easier.

23:23.895 --> 23:26.236
- So I'm not supposed to ask questions?
- No!

23:26.266 --> 23:28.156
You are supposed to do.

23:28.187 --> 23:29.489
Do whatever I need you to do,

23:29.519 --> 23:31.559
and right now, that is
to help me finish layout,

23:31.589 --> 23:34.307
- and then get this over to graphics.
- Don't you have an assistant for that?

23:34.338 --> 23:36.029
No, I have you,

23:36.636 --> 23:37.923
and once you're finished with graphics,

23:37.953 --> 23:39.676
then you can spend the rest
of the day working on your story.

23:39.706 --> 23:40.772
Don't need it.

23:40.803 --> 23:43.667
- What, it's ready?
- It will be.

23:47.730 --> 23:48.910
Can you mail that out for me?

23:49.071 --> 23:49.611
Thanks.

23:50.657 --> 23:52.780
I need a really big fish.

23:52.810 --> 23:54.939
Then I suggest you get out your waders.

23:54.969 --> 23:56.287
I wasn't wearing any...

23:56.318 --> 23:57.286
Never mind. Alex, look,

23:57.317 --> 23:59.426
I need a really big real
estate development deal

23:59.456 --> 24:01.085
so I can lure Buck away from Cedar Cove,

24:01.115 --> 24:03.642
- and far, far away.
- Good luck with that.

24:03.672 --> 24:04.928
Come on, look,

24:04.958 --> 24:06.701
you're plugged into Wall Street, right?

24:06.731 --> 24:08.143
You've got to know of someone or something?

24:08.174 --> 24:09.308
That was my past.

24:09.338 --> 24:10.943
Well, then today, it's your future.

24:10.974 --> 24:12.765
And why should I help you?

24:12.796 --> 24:15.042
You've made it quite clear,
almost on a daily basis,

24:15.072 --> 24:17.118
that once your father
leaves, you're gonna fire me.

24:17.268 --> 24:18.433
Okay, fine.

24:18.463 --> 24:19.697
Why don't we make a deal?

24:21.824 --> 24:24.949
- An actual deal with the devil?
- No, a lucrative deal.

24:25.105 --> 24:26.417
For you.

24:27.196 --> 24:28.589
Do yourself a favor, Alex,

24:28.769 --> 24:29.891
take care of yourself,

24:30.105 --> 24:31.324
because Buck's not going to.

24:37.373 --> 24:39.193
Hi.

24:39.223 --> 24:40.795
Hey.

24:40.826 --> 24:41.891
Heading home?

24:41.921 --> 24:44.285
Yeah. You?

24:44.316 --> 24:45.753
Ah, thinking.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.052
About a case?

24:47.082 --> 24:49.936
To be honest, my job.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.622
Just because Anthony wants to move back,

24:51.652 --> 24:53.460
doesn't mean you have to leave.

24:53.491 --> 24:55.939
He has a girlfriend in Port Orchard,

24:55.970 --> 24:57.670
and they haven't had much of a relationship

24:57.700 --> 24:59.894
since he went back to Philly
to take care of his dad.

25:00.078 --> 25:01.995
- But you like it here.
- I do.

25:02.025 --> 25:04.524
The people as much as the town.

25:04.554 --> 25:07.897
But, unlike Anthony,

25:07.928 --> 25:09.601
I don't have anything holding me here.

25:09.631 --> 25:10.899
You have friends.

25:10.929 --> 25:12.079
Lots of friends.

25:12.110 --> 25:13.429
I have friends back East, too,

25:13.459 --> 25:15.587
and family.

25:15.617 --> 25:19.483
I think it might be time for me to go home.

25:19.513 --> 25:21.512
Cedar Cove doesn't want to lose you.

25:21.542 --> 25:24.031
- You spoke to the whole town?
- Paul!

25:24.061 --> 25:25.881
Olivia, you like Anthony.

25:26.037 --> 25:28.190
Yeah, I like him, but...

25:29.689 --> 25:31.137
But what?

25:31.167 --> 25:34.172
Anthony is a good D.A.,

25:34.203 --> 25:36.247
but you're great D.A.

25:36.277 --> 25:38.659
Thank you.

25:38.689 --> 25:41.323
You can't be serious
about leaving like this.

25:41.354 --> 25:43.516
It just might be time

25:43.546 --> 25:45.877
for me to get back to my life.

25:45.908 --> 25:47.564
Face the music, so to speak.

25:47.594 --> 25:49.891
But you have a life here.

25:49.921 --> 25:53.196
I moved here because it
was a beautiful place,

25:53.227 --> 25:55.727
where nothing bad ever happened.

25:55.757 --> 25:58.079
Just because we're quaint
doesn't mean we're not real.

25:58.109 --> 26:00.314
I know.

26:00.344 --> 26:03.787
You have real, valuable relationships here,

26:03.941 --> 26:07.311
and your work has meaning
to a lot of people.

26:09.558 --> 26:10.993
I may...

26:11.743 --> 26:13.319
be good for Cedar Cove.

26:20.371 --> 26:22.125
I'm not sure Cedar Cove is good for me.

26:30.143 --> 26:32.249
I can tell there's something wrong, Mom.

26:32.475 --> 26:33.574
Cliff?

26:33.768 --> 26:36.448
He thinks the wedding isn't "us."

26:36.478 --> 26:37.798
Hmm.

26:37.828 --> 26:39.248
He thinks it's too "me."

26:39.279 --> 26:41.104
Marriage is all about compromise.

26:41.134 --> 26:42.621
Well, it's my wedding.

26:42.651 --> 26:44.105
His wedding, too.

26:44.135 --> 26:46.062
I don't want barbecue and a barn.

26:46.092 --> 26:48.119
And he doesn't want doves and a choir.

26:48.150 --> 26:49.907
So, find a middle ground.

26:49.937 --> 26:52.639
Don't you think this is just showing

26:52.669 --> 26:54.798
that maybe we are too
different to be together?

26:54.829 --> 26:56.030
No. All it means

26:56.060 --> 26:57.328
is that than you and
your husband-to-be

26:57.358 --> 26:58.879
have very different tastes.

26:58.910 --> 27:00.971
And I wish I could say you
were unique, but you're not.

27:01.001 --> 27:03.028
- Yeah?
- Mm.

27:03.058 --> 27:04.040
Bob wore sneakers.

27:04.070 --> 27:05.119
Oh.

27:05.150 --> 27:06.874
He wanted to wear plaid.

27:06.904 --> 27:08.358
Okay. Compromise.

27:08.388 --> 27:10.381
Compromise.

27:10.411 --> 27:12.371
Excuse me.

27:13.386 --> 27:14.480
What?

27:14.510 --> 27:17.111
Did I say something?

27:17.282 --> 27:21.411
She and John are not
finding compromise so easy.

27:21.441 --> 27:23.336
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

27:24.156 --> 27:25.560
So, should we talk about the bike ride?

27:25.590 --> 27:26.521
Yes.

27:26.551 --> 27:27.616
I had a great idea.

27:27.647 --> 27:29.024
To make it more meaningful.

27:29.597 --> 27:31.175
I called Ford Warriors In Pink.

27:31.206 --> 27:32.896
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

27:32.926 --> 27:34.886
And they agreed to sponsor

27:34.917 --> 27:37.079
our annual Seawall Bike Race.

27:37.109 --> 27:39.827
I looked up their website, Fordcares.com,

27:39.858 --> 27:43.538
and I had no idea that they have been
doing this work for, like, 20 years.

27:43.568 --> 27:44.736
- You know that hoodie you liked?
- Yeah?

27:44.766 --> 27:48.311
All the money I paid went directly into
one of four breast cancer charities,

27:48.341 --> 27:50.301
and I got to choose the charity.

27:50.332 --> 27:53.581
I say we turn Cedar Cove pink.

27:53.770 --> 27:54.840
Pink it is.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.285
You totally freaked me out.

28:10.316 --> 28:12.414
And now you know how we feel.

28:12.592 --> 28:14.519
I'm filing a protective
order in the morning.

28:14.549 --> 28:19.461
I told you, I'll stop at nothing
to protect my family from you.

28:19.491 --> 28:20.760
I'm your family.

28:23.932 --> 28:25.954
I'm your daughter.

28:32.685 --> 28:34.032
Valedictorian.

28:34.062 --> 28:35.212
Yes, ma'am.

28:35.243 --> 28:37.068
Aw... I'm so impressed.

28:38.250 --> 28:41.132
Really,

28:41.162 --> 28:43.577
what about the Scuba equipment?

28:43.608 --> 28:46.023
Aw, my first wife was into it, so...

28:46.053 --> 28:47.507
You never talk about her.

28:47.537 --> 28:48.940
No, I guess I don't.

28:48.971 --> 28:51.605
But she's Eric's mom.

28:51.635 --> 28:52.651
Yes.

28:52.682 --> 28:54.608
It'd be nice to know something about her.

28:58.084 --> 28:59.751
Okay.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.893
Where is this coming from?

29:03.076 --> 29:04.238
I, you know, I...

29:04.268 --> 29:05.620
I thought I really knew you,

29:05.650 --> 29:08.622
and I unpacked those boxes...

29:08.653 --> 29:10.950
Honey, of course, you know me.

29:10.980 --> 29:12.552
Of course you do.

29:12.582 --> 29:14.929
And I love you,

29:14.960 --> 29:16.348
and you love me.

29:16.892 --> 29:18.099
And believe me,

29:18.130 --> 29:21.845
high school yearbooks and scuba diving
are not what's important.

29:21.875 --> 29:24.593
What we have right here,

29:24.624 --> 29:26.415
that's what's important.

29:26.445 --> 29:27.528
Right?

29:27.558 --> 29:28.607
Yeah.

29:28.638 --> 29:30.625
Okay.

29:30.782 --> 29:31.981
Now, come on, let's eat.

29:32.167 --> 29:33.186
Let's have a nice dinner.

29:42.843 --> 29:44.855
What is it? What's wrong?

29:44.885 --> 29:46.912
It's not what's wrong,
it's what's finally right.

29:47.098 --> 29:47.977
What are you talking about?

29:48.008 --> 29:49.382
- I found her.
- Who?

29:49.412 --> 29:51.594
- Our daughter.
- What?

29:51.624 --> 29:54.630
We were looking for her,
and she found us.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.818
I don't know what to say.

29:57.478 --> 29:58.626
It's Gloria.

29:59.237 --> 30:01.292
Gloria is our daughter.

30:15.528 --> 30:18.156
Hey...

30:18.187 --> 30:19.557
Can't sleep?

30:19.587 --> 30:22.289
No, I'm sorry.

30:22.319 --> 30:24.565
That's okay.

30:24.596 --> 30:27.194
I am happy to be kept awake by you.

30:28.589 --> 30:30.939
I am happy to be here with you.

30:31.715 --> 30:32.731
That felt nice.

30:35.468 --> 30:36.833
Jack, uh...

30:37.384 --> 30:39.541
I'm worried about us.

30:43.339 --> 30:45.201
Okay, uh...

30:47.136 --> 30:48.952
So, what exactly are we talking about here?

30:49.274 --> 30:50.857
You don't share with me,

30:50.887 --> 30:54.320
or with anyone, really, not completely.

30:57.693 --> 30:58.773
Yeah, that's true.

30:58.842 --> 30:59.952
Why?

31:02.042 --> 31:07.235
When I was drinking too much...

31:07.265 --> 31:10.119
I had to learn how to be, um...

31:10.149 --> 31:12.733
not completely forthcoming

31:12.763 --> 31:14.807
with some things, so...

31:14.837 --> 31:17.083
That was then, this is now.

31:17.114 --> 31:18.601
I thought that you wanted this.

31:18.631 --> 31:20.726
I do.

31:20.756 --> 31:22.699
I just... don't want to
have to learn about you

31:22.729 --> 31:24.773
from unpacking your boxes.

31:24.804 --> 31:27.510
So, this is about trust again.

31:27.696 --> 31:28.816
Well, yeah.

31:29.045 --> 31:31.221
You know, because of what we
went through not that long ago,

31:31.402 --> 31:32.716
trust is an issue.

31:33.529 --> 31:37.052
So, why am I here?

31:37.082 --> 31:39.936
It's an issue, not an impediment.

31:39.966 --> 31:43.156
And the difference is...?

31:43.187 --> 31:44.624
I want to trust you,

31:44.655 --> 31:48.284
100%.

31:48.314 --> 31:51.623
Trust takes intimacy.

31:51.653 --> 31:55.198
Intimacy takes sharing.

31:55.229 --> 31:56.447
And you don't share.

31:56.477 --> 31:57.525
You withhold.

32:00.091 --> 32:01.860
Olivia...

32:01.890 --> 32:06.599
We are always gonna be learning
new things about each other.

32:06.630 --> 32:08.702
Not knowing the whole
story from the beginning,

32:08.884 --> 32:11.861
I mean, that's okay.

32:11.891 --> 32:14.492
Why rush to the ending?

32:14.523 --> 32:16.226
I mean, enjoy the journey.

32:16.939 --> 32:18.017
Right?

32:36.764 --> 32:38.649
How long are you gonna
watch that cat video?

32:39.111 --> 32:40.162
I don't know.

32:40.192 --> 32:42.013
What happened to the job search?

32:42.043 --> 32:43.649
I'm thinking of taking a "gap" month.

32:44.039 --> 32:45.889
It's not morning anymore, you know.

32:46.049 --> 32:47.578
What does it matter?

32:47.609 --> 32:49.451
You're still in your pajamas.

32:49.481 --> 32:50.665
Yup.

32:50.695 --> 32:51.896
Get up!

32:52.994 --> 32:53.971
No.

32:54.001 --> 32:55.235
We need your help.

32:55.266 --> 32:56.222
For?

32:56.394 --> 32:57.202
Maryellen called.

32:57.366 --> 32:59.430
Grace and Peggy are turning
the annual Seawall bike race

32:59.573 --> 33:00.838
into a Ford Warriors In Pink event.

33:00.971 --> 33:02.588
Don't you have to go to work?

33:02.619 --> 33:03.650
It's Saturday.

33:03.805 --> 33:06.553
All the days seem the same
when you don't have a job.

33:06.583 --> 33:08.744
Get up off that couch and
get out of those pajamas.

33:08.774 --> 33:10.110
Why?

33:10.141 --> 33:11.305
Because this is a really good cause,

33:11.447 --> 33:12.589
and we're a team!

33:12.620 --> 33:13.804
- We are?
- We're roommates.

33:13.834 --> 33:15.726
And that makes us a team.

33:15.756 --> 33:17.025
Now, come on, let's do it!

33:17.055 --> 33:18.627
Let's do this!

33:18.658 --> 33:20.028
You can do it. Come on!

33:20.058 --> 33:21.848
Come on!

33:21.878 --> 33:23.366
Nice...

33:24.059 --> 33:25.362
Now get changed.

33:25.392 --> 33:26.968
You can't be a "Warrior" looking like that.

33:27.183 --> 33:29.367
I have never seen this side of you.

33:29.568 --> 33:31.120
I was in Pep Squad in high school.

33:31.315 --> 33:33.741
- So you just "Pep Squaded" me?
- Don't make me cheer.

33:46.569 --> 33:48.287
- You're settling with them?
- Yes.

33:48.493 --> 33:49.203
They're lying.

33:49.233 --> 33:50.382
We have no proof.

33:50.413 --> 33:51.698
Because you won't believe me.

33:51.728 --> 33:53.756
I love you, Will, but
you have a history of...

33:53.786 --> 33:54.968
Of what?

33:55.148 --> 33:57.365
Not being truthful when you're in trouble.

33:57.395 --> 33:58.579
I'm not like that anymore.

33:58.609 --> 34:01.750
It's easier this way.

34:01.780 --> 34:03.739
It's easier to not believe
me, but it's not right.

34:03.770 --> 34:05.521
What happened to innocent
until proven guilty, huh?

34:05.676 --> 34:07.821
It's their word against mine.
They were not in the car.

34:07.852 --> 34:09.002
I left a note.

34:09.033 --> 34:10.553
They're lying, I'm not.

34:10.583 --> 34:11.728
I never did.

34:11.895 --> 34:13.386
I told you what I did, when I did it,

34:13.417 --> 34:15.012
and I told you I would take care of it,

34:15.183 --> 34:16.532
which I've been trying to do.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.842
You're joking, right?

34:23.873 --> 34:25.359
I will have it by the end of the day.

34:25.389 --> 34:26.929
No, I needed it by the end of yesterday,

34:26.960 --> 34:28.110
like I told you.

34:28.139 --> 34:29.324
I misunderstood.

34:29.355 --> 34:31.146
No, no, no, you didn't, Eddie.

34:31.176 --> 34:33.219
Look, I can help you rearrange the layout.

34:33.251 --> 34:34.293
No, I've already done that, Eddie.

34:34.454 --> 34:36.572
Now I have to write the
article that you didn't write.

34:36.603 --> 34:38.295
I can do that for you, Jack.

34:38.326 --> 34:41.065
You know what, the only thing I
want from you is for you to leave.

34:41.096 --> 34:42.786
This trial is over, it failed.

34:42.958 --> 34:44.003
Goodbye, Eddie.

34:48.956 --> 34:51.063
Jack...

34:51.094 --> 34:52.916
Eddie missed a deadline.

34:53.081 --> 34:55.465
Now I have a huge hole in
my Sunday Magazine section.

34:55.495 --> 34:56.833
- Well...
- Unacceptable.

34:56.864 --> 34:58.298
But you need to give Eddie another shot.

34:58.329 --> 35:01.771
Why in the world would I let
that kid have another shot?

35:01.944 --> 35:03.212
Eddie is my nephew.

35:12.686 --> 35:14.060
What's this?

35:14.091 --> 35:15.889
It's a spec condo
development in the Hamptons.

35:15.919 --> 35:17.592
Really?

35:17.623 --> 35:19.059
You call a friend?

35:19.089 --> 35:20.432
Luxury condos, but sticky neighbors,

35:20.603 --> 35:21.688
so the deal would need to be overseen,

35:21.718 --> 35:23.079
but it has the potential to be a windfall.

35:23.252 --> 35:24.927
Nice work, Alex.

35:24.958 --> 35:27.343
- Welcome to Team Warren, baby.
- No.

35:27.514 --> 35:30.409
Do what you want with the
deal, but I won't sell Buck out.

35:30.440 --> 35:33.361
All right, look, my offer
is still on the table.

35:33.392 --> 35:34.592
No thanks.

35:34.622 --> 35:35.488
Come on, Alex.

35:35.632 --> 35:37.661
Look, don't be a fool!
This is a sweet deal.

35:37.691 --> 35:38.722
I prefer a clean conscience.

35:38.752 --> 35:39.955
Yeah, well, I never saw the appeal.

35:39.986 --> 35:41.051
Why are you helping me?

35:41.081 --> 35:42.231
I'm helping the company.

35:42.262 --> 35:43.277
A friend called me about the deal.

35:43.307 --> 35:46.860
I can't help that it fulfils the
criteria of your sick and twisted plan

35:46.891 --> 35:48.542
to take back control of your company.

36:08.611 --> 36:09.823
Hey, where's Cliff?

36:09.854 --> 36:11.308
Oh, he's running late.

36:11.338 --> 36:12.993
There's apparently a problem at the ranch.

36:13.024 --> 36:14.040
Oh...

36:14.070 --> 36:15.895
Wow.

36:15.925 --> 36:17.547
This was a great idea, Peggy.

36:17.578 --> 36:21.174
Thanks, but Ford Warriors In
Pink get all the credit, honey.

36:21.204 --> 36:22.101
There you go.

36:22.131 --> 36:23.551
Have fun out there.

36:27.803 --> 36:28.476
Hi, Adele.

36:28.507 --> 36:30.804
So nice to see you.

36:40.266 --> 36:41.732
Excuse me. Sorry.

36:41.762 --> 36:43.418
Dad! Dad...

36:43.449 --> 36:44.768
I've got this great deal.

36:44.798 --> 36:47.178
- This isn't the time, Warren.
- No, listen, it's in the Hamptons.

36:47.208 --> 36:49.157
You know what that means,
right? I mean, it's a solid deal.

36:49.593 --> 36:51.109
I already took the deal.

36:51.139 --> 36:52.255
Okay, how is that possible?
I haven't even sent it...

36:56.339 --> 36:57.854
Alex.

36:57.885 --> 37:00.317
And I just signed Alex
to a two-year contract.

37:00.348 --> 37:01.279
Why?

37:01.309 --> 37:02.796
Because she brought me a big fat deal.

37:06.424 --> 37:08.581
- You sold me out.
- I didn't sell you out,

37:08.612 --> 37:10.437
I did my job.

37:19.984 --> 37:22.174
How's Cliff?

37:22.204 --> 37:24.282
Oh, we can't agree on the ceremony.

37:24.313 --> 37:26.425
My wedding reception

37:26.455 --> 37:29.173
is gonna turn into a
belated post bike ride party.

37:31.621 --> 37:32.462
Grace!

37:32.492 --> 37:33.946
John!

37:38.456 --> 37:39.585
Where's Luke?

37:41.229 --> 37:42.863
That's a good question.

37:42.893 --> 37:44.751
He's late.

37:44.781 --> 37:45.898
He is.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.550
You know, you're going
to be hard to replace.

37:54.580 --> 37:56.490
Yeah, didn't ever expect
to hear you say that.

37:56.520 --> 37:59.441
- How long you going for?
- Depends where they send me.

37:59.472 --> 38:00.537
Justine can't be happy.

38:07.623 --> 38:10.556
Woman: I could. I could get one of those.

38:10.586 --> 38:11.230
No, I'm good. I'll wait till after.

38:16.842 --> 38:17.936
John!

38:18.652 --> 38:19.324
John!

38:21.348 --> 38:24.135
- I've been looking all over for you.
- You're early for the wedding.

38:24.166 --> 38:26.544
I'm not here for the
wedding. I'm here for you,

38:26.574 --> 38:29.444
for us.

38:29.474 --> 38:30.667
I need to make things right.

38:30.697 --> 38:32.434
Does that mean you're
moving back to Cedar Cove?

38:32.464 --> 38:33.879
It means I got the
financing for the restaurant.

38:39.519 --> 38:40.636
I want to marry you.

38:42.218 --> 38:44.158
And I want us to run
the restaurant together.

38:52.971 --> 38:54.413
It's so beautiful today.

38:54.804 --> 38:55.888
Olivia!

38:56.514 --> 38:58.452
You made it.

38:58.483 --> 38:59.614
Well, uh...

38:59.644 --> 39:01.572
I need you to help me with something.

39:01.602 --> 39:03.258
Help you with what?

39:03.288 --> 39:05.029
With us.

39:05.060 --> 39:07.424
I want to meet you more than halfway,

39:08.692 --> 39:09.890
I just don't know how.

39:19.255 --> 39:20.365
Let's do this!

39:20.524 --> 39:23.530
Okay, Warriors, get ready!

39:24.544 --> 39:26.204
Get set...

39:27.715 --> 39:32.621
Go!

39:32.651 --> 39:34.195
Come on, Moon!

39:38.525 --> 39:39.946
Good job!

40:07.264 --> 40:08.645
Hey.

40:08.675 --> 40:10.634
Oh, hi there.

40:10.664 --> 40:11.848
I'm looking for Luke.

40:11.879 --> 40:12.919
He'll be right back.

40:12.949 --> 40:14.713
- I sent him to the mechanic for a part.
- Oh.

40:14.874 --> 40:16.537
It's pretty wild, huh?

40:16.567 --> 40:18.560
Wild?

40:18.591 --> 40:20.197
Luke talked to you, right?

40:20.228 --> 40:21.260
No.

40:21.290 --> 40:22.726
Oh.

40:22.757 --> 40:25.003
What?

40:25.033 --> 40:26.943
Uh, he needs to tell you.

40:26.973 --> 40:28.429
I think you'd better tell me.

40:29.862 --> 40:30.990
He's leaving.

40:31.021 --> 40:32.566
Yeah, for a few days.

40:32.596 --> 40:33.739
He's going to clear his head.

40:33.769 --> 40:35.628
No.

40:35.659 --> 40:36.303
He's going to re-up.

40:36.333 --> 40:37.736
He's going to what?

40:42.259 --> 40:45.229
So, you still haven't
answered my question yet.

40:45.753 --> 40:46.879
Mary Ellen Sherman,

40:47.047 --> 40:48.057
will you marry me?

40:49.678 --> 40:51.078
Yes.

40:51.990 --> 40:53.641
Yes! Yes!

40:56.610 --> 40:58.060
Wait, you said yes, right?

40:58.090 --> 40:59.999
I did.

41:00.029 --> 41:01.060
I love you.

41:01.091 --> 41:03.624
I love you.

41:03.654 --> 41:05.647
Okay, what's up, you two?

41:05.678 --> 41:06.660
Mom...

41:06.690 --> 41:08.120
Yeah?

41:08.286 --> 41:09.613
I'm engaged.

41:11.655 --> 41:14.419
- We're getting married.
- Wow.

41:15.779 --> 41:16.913
Oh, honey.

41:25.383 --> 41:26.331
Anthony!

41:26.507 --> 41:28.526
Hey, I saw your bike out there,
I thought I'd stop in.

41:28.656 --> 41:30.357
Oh, I had to drop by
and pick up some files.

41:30.538 --> 41:31.737
Nice to see you.

41:31.767 --> 41:33.108
- You too.
- How's your dad?

41:33.273 --> 41:34.383
Doing so much better.

41:34.413 --> 41:35.969
- Oh, I'm so glad.
- Yeah, me too.

41:35.999 --> 41:37.874
Well, I'm back.

41:37.905 --> 41:38.971
Back?

41:39.001 --> 41:41.146
Yeah, don't worry, it's going to
be a very smooth transition.

41:41.199 --> 41:42.546
Transition?

41:42.576 --> 41:44.317
Didn't Paul tell you?

41:44.347 --> 41:45.968
No. Tell me what?

41:46.305 --> 41:52.781
