WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:03.115
We leave first thing in the morning,

00:03.140 --> 00:04.743
be at Ed's cabin by noon,

00:04.812 --> 00:07.145
and immediately start
chopping wood for the fire.

00:07.214 --> 00:08.680
I'm bringing my axe.

00:08.749 --> 00:11.717
Good. Now I won't have to find a
sharp rock to kill myself with.

00:11.952 --> 00:13.318
Don't be negative, Oliver.

00:13.387 --> 00:15.487
Us living off the land, no electricity.

00:15.556 --> 00:17.189
It'll be fun, Dad.

00:17.258 --> 00:19.024
It'll just be like
when you broke gender barriers

00:19.093 --> 00:20.292
to be the first male Den Mother.

00:20.361 --> 00:21.994
Remember how I turned
my skirt into capris?

00:22.062 --> 00:24.963
It was pretty awesome.
I was a real trailblazer.

00:25.032 --> 00:26.632
They called me a modern-day FDR.

00:26.700 --> 00:29.869
You mean you called yourself
that, and no one stopped you.

00:29.970 --> 00:31.203
Fair enough.

00:31.272 --> 00:32.938
Don't most people
go camping in the summer?

00:33.007 --> 00:34.840
Yeah, but Ed makes you pay
for the cabin in the summer.

00:34.909 --> 00:36.208
But this is gonna be great.

00:36.277 --> 00:37.876
Anna-Kat's finally
old enough to camp with us,

00:37.945 --> 00:39.244
and you might just like it.

00:39.313 --> 00:41.680
It's not too late to follow
in the Otto family tradition.

00:41.749 --> 00:43.315
Some families are soldiers, some cops.

00:43.384 --> 00:44.349
We're scouts.

00:44.418 --> 00:45.817
Eagle Scouts.

00:45.886 --> 00:47.953
Well, I've been dying
to wear a red kerchief

00:48.022 --> 00:49.621
around my neck and have no friends.

00:49.690 --> 00:52.424
Son, men have died for
the right to wear that kerchief.

00:52.493 --> 00:53.759
No, they haven't.

00:53.827 --> 00:56.128
I don't have time
for off-season family bonding.

00:56.197 --> 00:57.696
I have a business to run.

00:57.765 --> 01:01.166
Your mom and I don't like
you selling knockoff polo shirts

01:01.235 --> 01:02.000
to kids in Norwalk.

01:02.069 --> 01:03.335
They're not knockoffs.

01:03.404 --> 01:04.703
They're shirts with defective logos

01:04.772 --> 01:06.271
that I improve and re-sell.

01:06.340 --> 01:08.240
Isn't that the exact
definition of knockoff?

01:08.309 --> 01:09.608
I'm providing a service.

01:09.677 --> 01:11.276
Those Norwalk kids
are just happy they can get

01:11.345 --> 01:12.978
an expensive shirt for 40 bucks

01:13.047 --> 01:15.013
so they can have a fancy
night out at Dairy Queen.

01:17.918 --> 01:19.318
I brought you pillows.

01:19.386 --> 01:21.987
We don't need no stinkin' pillows!

01:22.056 --> 01:23.355
We'll make our own.

01:23.424 --> 01:24.590
Pine needles in a sweatshirt.

01:24.658 --> 01:26.325
That sounds so fun.

01:26.393 --> 01:27.759
Ugh! I wish I could go.

01:27.828 --> 01:29.394
But Angela needs me.

01:29.463 --> 01:31.563
It's the one-year anniversary of
her breakup with Celeste.

01:31.632 --> 01:32.731
I totally get it.

01:32.800 --> 01:33.966
You need to be there for your friend.

01:34.034 --> 01:37.002
But I hate the thought of you guys
being on an adventure without me.

01:37.071 --> 01:39.671
Hey. Can I bring my new fish?

01:39.740 --> 01:42.841
Uh, I don't think camping
will be good for it.

01:42.910 --> 01:46.378
Yeah, it will die in two days instead of
its normal life span of four days.

01:46.447 --> 01:48.180
- Oliver.
- I'm not the one who bought

01:48.249 --> 01:51.049
a death-obsessed 7-year-old
a pet with a high mortality rate.

01:52.419 --> 01:54.720
He's got a good point.

01:54.788 --> 01:56.255
You know, I'm going
to go to Second Breakfast

01:56.323 --> 01:57.389
and try to get out of it.

01:57.458 --> 01:59.737
I really want to come with you guys.

01:59.827 --> 02:01.793
He actually thinks that I want to go.

02:01.962 --> 02:03.595
Am I that good, or is he that dumb?

02:06.100 --> 02:08.967

<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

02:11.071 --> 02:13.171
Should I feel bad that I don't feel bad

02:13.240 --> 02:15.173
about blowing off
the family camping trip?

02:15.242 --> 02:17.209
No. You'd hate it,
complain the whole time,

02:17.278 --> 02:18.343
and ruin it for Greg.

02:18.412 --> 02:20.279
Besides, your whole life is camping.

02:20.347 --> 02:21.647
You have suffered enough.

02:21.715 --> 02:23.115
Your stove only has four burners,

02:23.183 --> 02:25.117
there's weird pockets of sand
everywhere in your house,

02:25.185 --> 02:27.152
and no one can drop one
in your downstairs bathroom.

02:27.221 --> 02:28.887
Get that fixed. It's awkward.

02:28.956 --> 02:30.856
When I go upstairs,
everyone knows what I'm doing.

02:30.924 --> 02:32.457
I love you guys.

02:32.526 --> 02:35.227
You always make me feel so right
about doing the wrong thing.

02:35.296 --> 02:36.428
You shouldn't be expected

02:36.497 --> 02:37.663
to share all of
your husband's interests.

02:37.731 --> 02:39.798
I know. I got pregnant with Anna-Kat

02:39.867 --> 02:41.533
specifically to avoid
Greg's camping trips.

02:41.602 --> 02:43.001
It bought me six years.

02:43.070 --> 02:45.470
But this year, Angela's
divorce got you out of it,

02:45.539 --> 02:50.442
and I booked us a three-bedroom
suite at the Velvet Zen Spa.

02:51.712 --> 02:53.278
Thank you so much
for cheating on your wife

02:53.347 --> 02:54.313
and ruining your marriage.

02:54.381 --> 02:55.580
It was a pleasure.

02:55.649 --> 02:57.049
It really was.

02:57.117 --> 02:58.617
I wish I could go
up with you guys tonight,

02:58.686 --> 02:59.985
but the least I can do is help them

03:00.054 --> 03:01.253
get out the door tomorrow morning.

03:01.322 --> 03:03.522
Where are we going?

03:03.590 --> 03:06.024
- Ooh.
- That chair's for our purses.

03:06.093 --> 03:07.125
You're so funny.

03:07.194 --> 03:09.828
Hey, guess what happened
to me yesterday.

03:09.897 --> 03:13.065
I was getting my lashes put on,
and Alan bursts in the room

03:13.133 --> 03:16.668
with a bouquet of peonies for no reason

03:16.737 --> 03:18.203
other than that he loves me.

03:19.206 --> 03:20.472
Hashtag "Lucky."

03:20.541 --> 03:22.574
Hashtag "How long are you staying?"

03:22.643 --> 03:25.310
Well, now that I've spent Thanksgiving

03:25.379 --> 03:27.279
and Christmas at Katie's,

03:27.348 --> 03:29.948
I thought maybe I could join your little
Second Breakfast Club.

03:30.017 --> 03:31.116
Wow.

03:31.185 --> 03:34.453
Well, you don't
eat first breakfast, so...

03:34.521 --> 03:35.620
You see how that wouldn't work?

03:35.689 --> 03:36.688
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:36.757 --> 03:38.023
Hazing.

03:38.092 --> 03:41.560
You guys are all hazing me
before you let me in.

03:41.628 --> 03:43.995
- I love it.
- She loves it.

03:44.064 --> 03:45.364
Ooh, that's a lot of carbs.

03:45.432 --> 03:46.531
Bye!

03:46.600 --> 03:48.033
Oh, my God, she is unbelievable.

03:48.102 --> 03:51.203
I know. I can't stand how fake she is.

03:51.271 --> 03:52.504
Right.

03:52.573 --> 03:54.973
Now you go home
and mislead the ones you love.

03:55.042 --> 03:57.142
You would think
that would make me feel guilty,

03:57.211 --> 03:58.944
but I flipped off that switch years ago.

04:00.547 --> 04:02.147
Let's get you guys on the road.

04:04.218 --> 04:08.387
- <i>You owe me money.</i>
- Luz, I'm not exactly liquid right now.

04:08.455 --> 04:10.756
I took our profits
and re-invested in more shirts.

04:10.824 --> 04:12.057
<i>You didn't ask me.</i>

04:12.126 --> 04:14.025
Luz, as soon as I get
back into town, I promise...

04:14.094 --> 04:15.293
<i>You're skipping town on me?</i>

04:15.362 --> 04:16.628
No, I'm going camping.

04:16.697 --> 04:18.363
- <i>You're going camping?</i>
- I am.

04:18.432 --> 04:19.898
Mom, tell her I'm going camping.

04:19.966 --> 04:22.334
No, this isn't too much wine.

04:22.403 --> 04:23.535
We're not going camping.

04:23.604 --> 04:25.036
- <i>Knew it.</i>
- What?

04:25.105 --> 04:27.172
<b>Luz, do you think we should get a cat?</b>

04:27.241 --> 04:28.673
<i>I'm kind of wanting one again.</i>

04:28.742 --> 04:30.242
<i>Coming, Miss Viv!</i>

04:30.310 --> 04:32.077
<i>I want my money.</i>

04:33.113 --> 04:34.312
Luz!

04:34.381 --> 04:35.814
Why would you say that?

04:35.883 --> 04:39.518
Because we're not going camping.

04:39.586 --> 04:41.319
It snowed all night,
and I checked online,

04:41.388 --> 04:43.455
all the roads are closed.

04:43.524 --> 04:46.324
No!

04:46.393 --> 04:48.427
It was supposed to be a dusting.

04:48.495 --> 04:49.995
They said it was a dusting.

04:50.063 --> 04:51.496
I was really looking forward to this.

04:51.565 --> 04:53.498
And this is the only weekend
that we could get Ed's cabin.

04:53.567 --> 04:54.933
We were gonna ice fish for hours

04:55.002 --> 04:56.067
and catch nothing...

04:56.136 --> 04:57.235
but memories.

04:57.304 --> 04:58.937
- Damn.
- I know.

05:00.207 --> 05:02.073
- The power's out.
- You got to be kidding me!

05:02.142 --> 05:03.942
Wait.

05:04.011 --> 05:05.076
This is great.

05:05.145 --> 05:06.311
It is?

05:06.380 --> 05:07.612
You know what? One of us has been using

05:07.681 --> 05:09.314
the word "great" wrong our whole life.

05:09.383 --> 05:10.882
No, don't you see?
We can do our camping trip

05:10.951 --> 05:12.217
right here in our living room.

05:12.286 --> 05:14.085
It's just like Ed's cabin,
but instead of having

05:14.154 --> 05:15.787
a dead moose head on the wall,
we got Mom!

05:15.856 --> 05:17.355
It's all coming together.

05:17.424 --> 05:18.957
Everybody wins.

05:19.026 --> 05:20.292
<i>Kill me.</i>

05:20.360 --> 05:22.227
Okay, let's move the couches
so I can create a base camp.

05:28.302 --> 05:31.269
It was supposed to be a dusting.

05:34.062 --> 05:35.620
We've got three feet of snow.

05:35.705 --> 05:37.416
I'm stuck here, and Greg is forcing me

05:37.441 --> 05:39.307
to make memories I don't want to make.

05:39.409 --> 05:41.832
<i>Well, if it helps you feel better,
we're snowed in here, too.</i>

05:41.901 --> 05:44.468
You're snowed in getting massages.

05:44.537 --> 05:46.404
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

05:46.472 --> 05:48.372
<i>Right there.</i>

05:48.441 --> 05:49.473
Is that champagne?

05:49.542 --> 05:51.742
This is the meanest FaceTime ever.

05:52.912 --> 05:54.245
Hey, Katie, come on.

05:54.314 --> 05:56.714
I'm teaching the kids how to
make lanterns out of water jugs.

05:56.783 --> 05:58.783
Coming, honey.

05:58.851 --> 06:01.352
So excited.

06:01.421 --> 06:02.987
If I'm dead tomorrow, Greg did it.

06:03.056 --> 06:04.349
But I drove him to it.

06:04.374 --> 06:06.424
You don't know when our house is
going to get its power back?

06:06.492 --> 06:09.260
That's not an acceptable answer.

06:09.329 --> 06:11.629
No, I don't want to
talk to your supervisor.

06:11.698 --> 06:14.799
I want to talk to the guy below
you who's about to get your job.

06:17.103 --> 06:18.235
My fish is cold.

06:18.304 --> 06:19.287
Don't worry, sweetie.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.539
I'm starting a fire utilizing
nothing but steel wool,

06:21.607 --> 06:24.943
a nine-volt battery, and a small
pile of cheese puffs.

06:25.059 --> 06:26.959
Why don't you just use
one of those long matches?

06:27.013 --> 06:28.946
'Cause you married an Eagle Scout, baby.

06:29.015 --> 06:30.248
Come be amazed.

06:30.316 --> 06:32.216
That's fantastic.

06:32.285 --> 06:34.118
Hope the power never comes back on.

06:35.822 --> 06:38.155
Why are Viv's lights on?

06:38.224 --> 06:39.991
She clearly has a generator.

06:40.059 --> 06:42.360
The lesson here is marry money, people.

06:42.428 --> 06:44.028
That is not the lesson, people.

06:44.097 --> 06:45.730
We actually have it
better than she does.

06:45.798 --> 06:47.298
She's not learning how to start a fire

06:47.367 --> 06:49.433
or build a shelter or make
her urine more drinkable.

06:49.502 --> 06:51.102
Now, who wants to tie some knots?

06:51.170 --> 06:53.004
<i>Did he just say we're
drinking our own urine?</i>

06:53.072 --> 06:55.006
My fish is starting to shiver.

06:55.074 --> 06:57.475
I have an idea.

06:57.543 --> 07:00.611
I'll take the fish
over to Viv's immediately.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.813
<i>This is great.</i>

07:02.882 --> 07:05.483
<i>I get to be a hero
and blow off my family.</i>

07:10.123 --> 07:12.290
Katie, what brings you here?

07:12.358 --> 07:16.127
The power's out, and I just
wanted to make sure you're okay.

07:16.195 --> 07:18.129
I didn't even realize.

07:18.197 --> 07:19.864
You brought a gift.

07:19.933 --> 07:21.866
No, this is actually my daughter's fish.

07:21.935 --> 07:23.634
I don't want it to freeze.

07:23.703 --> 07:25.703
Oh, come in.

07:25.772 --> 07:27.038
Shoes.

07:30.944 --> 07:32.710
Are your floors heated?

07:32.779 --> 07:33.978
Of course they're heated.

07:34.047 --> 07:35.413
They're floors.

07:35.481 --> 07:36.480
Come on.

07:39.052 --> 07:39.984
Come in.

07:40.053 --> 07:41.719
Have a seat.

07:41.788 --> 07:43.587
Luz, bring us some hot cider!

07:43.656 --> 07:45.189
<i>Being with someone I can't stand</i>

07:45.258 --> 07:46.791
<i>in order to stay warm and well fed?</i>

07:46.859 --> 07:49.226
<i>These are my survival skills.</i>

07:49.295 --> 07:50.995
And I'm not afraid of cookies, Luz!

07:51.064 --> 07:54.131
Here. It must be so cold out there.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.766
Ahh.

07:55.835 --> 07:57.635
This is so soft.

07:57.704 --> 07:58.970
Is this made of puppy?

07:59.038 --> 08:01.405
You.

08:01.474 --> 08:03.774
There's my special girl.

08:07.380 --> 08:08.546
Oh, my God.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.147
These are so good.

08:10.216 --> 08:11.182
- They are?
- Mm-hmm.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.451
I don't eat them. I just like the smell.

08:13.519 --> 08:14.418
Mm-hmm.

08:15.488 --> 08:19.090
<i>Luz, yo holo teléfono.</i>

08:22.128 --> 08:25.596
I don't really speak Spanish.

08:25.665 --> 08:27.631
Bring me my money, Oliver.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.433
Oh, God.

08:29.502 --> 08:31.936
I just remembered I have a family.

08:32.005 --> 08:33.504
I have to go back home.

08:33.573 --> 08:34.739
Are you sure?

08:34.807 --> 08:35.940
Give me one reason to stay here,

08:36.009 --> 08:37.107
and I'll turn right back around.

08:37.176 --> 08:39.342
Is that a reference thing?
Is that Jay-Z?

08:39.412 --> 08:42.746
Usually when I don't
get things, it's Jay-Z.

08:42.815 --> 08:44.348
Goodbye, Viv.

08:48.955 --> 08:51.088
Viv's going to keep
Anna-Kat's fish safe.

08:51.157 --> 08:52.590
Well, took a whole bag of cheese puffs,

08:52.658 --> 08:54.058
but I got the fire started.

08:54.127 --> 08:56.460
Who knew that the kids'
favorite snack was combustible?

08:56.529 --> 08:57.862
Very. Okay, troops,

08:57.930 --> 09:00.398
let's start making a shelter
out of available materials.

09:00.466 --> 09:02.166
We'll need the hat rack,
some chip clips,

09:02.235 --> 09:03.934
and take the shoelaces
out of your shoes.

09:04.003 --> 09:05.369
Here's a great idea for a shelter.

09:05.438 --> 09:07.405
How about this house
that already covers us?

09:09.075 --> 09:10.074
Hey, where are you going?

09:10.143 --> 09:12.143
Upstairs to use the bathroom.

09:12.211 --> 09:14.545
There's no upstairs in camping.

09:14.614 --> 09:16.047
We'll have to dig a latrine in the snow.

09:16.115 --> 09:18.482
I can teach you how to make a shovel
out of a dust pan and a curtain rod.

09:18.551 --> 09:19.950
I love it all.

09:20.019 --> 09:22.119
<i>I'm supposed to be
at a spa with my friends,</i>

09:22.188 --> 09:24.388
<i>not in a sandy, poopless house.</i>

09:24.457 --> 09:25.890
<i>I'm not a happy camper.</i>

09:25.958 --> 09:27.758
Ah, would you look at that.

09:27.827 --> 09:29.207
I forgot the fish food.

09:29.395 --> 09:30.694
Be right back.

09:30.763 --> 09:33.223
Damn it, that's a fine woman.

09:33.366 --> 09:36.467
Oh. I'm so glad you came back.

09:36.536 --> 09:41.205
I just wanted to hang out
with you and... your stuff.

09:41.274 --> 09:43.574
So, where's your husband?

09:43.643 --> 09:44.775
Where are your step-sons?

09:44.844 --> 09:47.545
Oh, they've been fishing
in the Bahamas all week.

09:47.613 --> 09:49.046
Boys trip.

09:49.115 --> 09:51.749
But I thought you said Alan
brought you flowers yesterday.

09:51.818 --> 09:53.250
Right.

09:53.319 --> 09:54.618
I did say that.

09:54.687 --> 09:56.654
Mm-hmm.

09:56.722 --> 09:58.022
Okay.

09:58.091 --> 10:00.124
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

10:00.193 --> 10:02.193
- Don't take this the wrong way.
- I won't.

10:02.261 --> 10:03.661
But why are you such a liar?

10:03.729 --> 10:05.796
- You.
- Stop it with the "you."

10:05.865 --> 10:07.565
I'm asking you an actual question,

10:07.633 --> 10:09.166
and don't say that you love it.

10:11.170 --> 10:13.137
I just wanted to be
one of the girls, I guess.

10:13.206 --> 10:16.941
You can't be part of our group
unless you're open and real.

10:17.009 --> 10:18.375
Girl, you so crazy.

10:18.444 --> 10:19.710
Like that?

10:19.779 --> 10:21.679
Here's the rule of Second Breakfast.

10:21.747 --> 10:23.380
We tell the truth about our lives.

10:23.449 --> 10:25.116
The worse the story,
the louder you tell it.

10:25.184 --> 10:26.717
If you find a gray hair down there,

10:26.786 --> 10:28.519
you better take a picture
and pass it on.

10:28.588 --> 10:30.354
Lasered. I'm like a seal down there.

10:30.423 --> 10:33.457
A lot of people would think that that
is too much information, but not us.

10:33.526 --> 10:35.092
We're brutally honest with each other.

10:35.161 --> 10:36.827
- I love it.
- No, you don't love it.

10:36.896 --> 10:38.116
- We just talked about that.
- Right, right.

10:38.141 --> 10:40.764
I think I can do this. Just...
just give me another chance, okay?

10:40.833 --> 10:42.766
- Fine. I will.
- Okay.

10:42.835 --> 10:44.935
What do you think about that?

10:45.004 --> 10:46.604
I like it.

10:46.672 --> 10:47.872
But deep down, I love it!

10:47.940 --> 10:49.607
Oh! Luz!

10:49.675 --> 10:51.308
Bring us champagne in the living room!

10:51.377 --> 10:52.810
Can't we just bring it ourselves?

10:52.879 --> 10:54.912
No. She likes doing it.

10:56.349 --> 10:58.949
Okay, high grades for improvisation.

10:59.018 --> 11:01.352
Low marks for over-reliance on mops.

11:01.420 --> 11:02.987
Now, what kind of knot do we use

11:03.055 --> 11:04.288
to secure the Swiffers to the frame?

11:04.357 --> 11:05.856
- Power cinch.
- Right.

11:05.925 --> 11:08.259
Oliver, you haven't
answered a single question.

11:08.327 --> 11:09.326
How about I ask one?

11:09.395 --> 11:10.895
Why do we own three Swiffers?

11:10.963 --> 11:13.297
Because your mom can never find
the mopping-cloth refills,

11:13.366 --> 11:15.599
so she keeps buying new ones.

11:15.668 --> 11:17.334
Anyway, I'd like it if you joined us.

11:17.403 --> 11:18.969
This is business.

11:19.038 --> 11:20.938
I have more pressing things to do.

11:23.376 --> 11:24.341
Hey.

11:24.410 --> 11:26.243
Camping... no electronics.

11:26.312 --> 11:29.280
Fine. Then I'm going across
the street to talk to Luz.

11:29.348 --> 11:30.814
Make sure my fish is okay.

11:30.883 --> 11:32.349
She's all I have.

11:32.418 --> 11:34.752
You have parents, two siblings,
and a room full of ponies.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.654
Eh.

11:38.357 --> 11:39.990
So I went with this sort of dark brocade

11:40.059 --> 11:42.126
because I thought it would be
easier for Luz to care for,

11:42.195 --> 11:43.260
- and it is.
- Mm-hmm.

11:43.329 --> 11:45.129
But every time I look at that chair,

11:45.198 --> 11:47.965
I think back to
that pale blue Belgian silk

11:48.034 --> 11:49.333
I should have chosen.

11:51.404 --> 11:53.237
So that's it?

11:53.306 --> 11:54.805
That's your biggest regret?

11:54.874 --> 11:57.241
How you upholstered
a chaise in your guest room?

11:57.310 --> 11:58.342
Am I in?

11:58.411 --> 12:00.411
Viv, sorry. Just not happening.

12:00.479 --> 12:01.779
No, no, no. I can do better.

12:01.847 --> 12:05.382
Fine. Then I'm gonna need
more champagne and more cookies.

12:05.451 --> 12:06.550
And by any chance, do you have

12:06.619 --> 12:08.219
a downstairs bathroom
with reliable plumbing?

12:08.287 --> 12:09.720
Six of them.

12:15.461 --> 12:16.493
You have my money?

12:16.562 --> 12:19.096
Luz, coming in caliente.

12:19.165 --> 12:20.798
You don't have my money.

12:20.866 --> 12:23.667
Like I told you,
I re-invested our profits.

12:23.736 --> 12:27.304
I bought more shirts for you
to fix and for me to sell.

12:27.373 --> 12:29.740
I don't want to fix more shirts.

12:29.809 --> 12:31.308
I'm done living here.

12:31.377 --> 12:32.676
I'm saving up to go home.

12:32.745 --> 12:34.044
Aren't you home here?

12:34.113 --> 12:36.380
You stupid Westport boy.

12:36.449 --> 12:38.649
My real home... El Salvador.

12:38.718 --> 12:39.950
I miss my family.

12:40.019 --> 12:42.319
But you can't leave.
We've got a good thing going.

12:42.388 --> 12:45.589
I have a 7-year-old
granddaughter I've never met.

12:45.658 --> 12:48.325
I have a 7-year-old sister.
You're not missing much.

12:50.496 --> 12:51.595
Mom?

12:51.664 --> 12:52.463
Oliver?

12:52.531 --> 12:54.398
What are you doing here?

12:54.467 --> 12:56.467
You're supposed to be
house-camping with Dad.

12:56.535 --> 12:59.236
I could say the same about you.

12:59.305 --> 13:00.504
Is that champagne?

13:00.573 --> 13:01.705
Oh.

13:01.774 --> 13:04.375
You forgot how a mother-son
relationship works.

13:04.443 --> 13:05.809
I don't answer to you,

13:05.878 --> 13:08.679
so you turn your little ass
around and go home.

13:14.587 --> 13:19.023
Luz, what's my biggest regret?

13:21.927 --> 13:23.093
Hey, we're whittling.

13:23.162 --> 13:24.428
Hey, I didn't ask.

13:24.497 --> 13:26.130
I've had enough of you today.

13:26.198 --> 13:27.364
Is it so hard for you to join in

13:27.433 --> 13:28.632
and act like part of this family?

13:28.701 --> 13:30.434
I'm just not interested in camping.

13:30.503 --> 13:31.702
Yeah, but I'm interested.

13:31.771 --> 13:32.870
And your sisters are interested.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.371
And your mom's interested.

13:34.440 --> 13:36.540
And, to be honest, I don't care
if you're not interested.

13:36.609 --> 13:38.309
Sometimes you do things
for other people.

13:38.377 --> 13:40.778
If Mom's so interested,
how come she's hiding out

13:40.846 --> 13:43.347
across the street
drinking champagne with Viv?

13:43.416 --> 13:44.381
There's no way.

13:44.450 --> 13:45.582
You could be right.

13:45.651 --> 13:47.651
I suppose it might have
been a nice Prosecco.

13:50.356 --> 13:54.024
Does losing a favorite shoe on the
ferry to Nantucket count as a regret?

13:54.093 --> 13:55.225
Keep thinking, Viv.

13:55.294 --> 13:57.261
- Ah.
- Oh, my God... whole cashews!

13:57.330 --> 13:58.762
This is some life.

13:58.831 --> 14:00.130
Is it?

14:02.501 --> 14:04.868
Greg?

14:08.140 --> 14:09.673
Couch kind of just swallows you up.

14:09.742 --> 14:11.108
No, don't get up.

14:11.177 --> 14:12.743
I don't want you to do anything
you don't want to do.

14:12.812 --> 14:14.178
Really?

14:14.246 --> 14:15.379
Feels like a trap.

14:15.448 --> 14:16.947
I'm across the street with our kids

14:17.016 --> 14:18.982
trying to make the best
of a bad situation,

14:19.051 --> 14:21.285
thinking how great it is
that you're on my side.

14:21.354 --> 14:23.287
But, evidently,
camping with me is worse than

14:23.356 --> 14:25.456
hanging out with someone
you can't stand.

14:29.095 --> 14:31.662
You can't stand me?

14:31.731 --> 14:34.498
To be fair, I've been
pretty clear about that.

14:34.567 --> 14:35.833
Huh.

14:40.174 --> 14:42.095
So are you gonna head home?

14:42.942 --> 14:44.642
I'm gonna let him cool down.

14:44.710 --> 14:45.976
It's really not my fault.

14:46.045 --> 14:48.812
I cannot be expected to share
his same interests, right?

14:48.881 --> 14:50.114
Oh, I've been there.

14:50.182 --> 14:52.016
- My first husband...
- Wait.

14:52.084 --> 14:53.417
You were married before?

14:53.486 --> 14:55.586
Yeah, for like five years.

14:55.655 --> 14:57.621
And it never crossed
your mind to share that?

14:57.690 --> 14:59.700
Interested piqued. Proceed.

14:59.725 --> 15:01.658
Well, I just... I really
don't like to talk about it.

15:01.727 --> 15:02.926
It was back when I was still heavy.

15:02.995 --> 15:04.261
I mean, not as heavy as you, of course.

15:04.330 --> 15:05.429
Of course.

15:05.498 --> 15:06.830
We lived in this little house upstate.

15:06.899 --> 15:08.302
I mean, not as small
as yours, of course.

15:08.359 --> 15:10.126
Don't feel the need
to include me in your story.

15:10.202 --> 15:11.435
And he was super into model trains.

15:11.504 --> 15:12.703
He kept them in the garage,

15:12.772 --> 15:14.171
you know, on of those
big pieces of plywood.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.973
With the green fake grass
and the tiny little trees?

15:16.042 --> 15:17.541
- Yeah, that's the kind.
- Yeah.

15:17.610 --> 15:19.376
So he would invite me out
to see his latest

15:19.445 --> 15:22.212
tiny turn-of-the-century town
and expect me to be excited

15:22.281 --> 15:23.781
and operate the switch track,

15:23.849 --> 15:27.318
and he just didn't get that his
thing really wasn't my thing.

15:27.386 --> 15:29.920
So you get where I'm coming from
with this whole camping thing.

15:29.989 --> 15:32.956
- 100%.
- Viv, look at you!

15:33.025 --> 15:35.159
This is Second Breakfast talk.
You're doing it!

15:35.227 --> 15:36.694
I'm being completely honest!

15:38.531 --> 15:42.166
So then, he moved
the trains into the kitchen.

15:42.234 --> 15:43.701
- No.
- Yeah.

15:43.769 --> 15:45.636
He saw it at Swensons
and thought it looked cool.

15:45.705 --> 15:47.071
No wonder you left.

15:47.139 --> 15:48.472
Well, that's the thing.

15:48.541 --> 15:51.108
I didn't leave, and he
really didn't leave me.

15:51.177 --> 15:55.179
We just sort of drifted apart
and each did our own thing.

15:55.247 --> 15:58.982
If I had just shown an interest
in those stupid trains...

15:59.051 --> 16:00.250
and it's not really even the trains,

16:00.319 --> 16:03.887
it's any of it... the Yankees
or going clamming.

16:03.956 --> 16:06.223
- Mm. Mm.
- Or swing dancing.

16:06.292 --> 16:07.591
If I had just shown
a glimmer of interest

16:07.660 --> 16:09.927
in any of those things,

16:09.995 --> 16:11.462
it would have meant the world to him.

16:13.499 --> 16:15.199
- One question.
- Hm?

16:15.267 --> 16:17.468
Did the track go around
the top of the kitchen?

16:17.536 --> 16:18.769
Yeah.

16:18.838 --> 16:20.738
That's how I was picturing it.

16:20.806 --> 16:24.708
Now I'm in this huge house with
more than I could ever need,

16:24.777 --> 16:29.780
in flawless shape,
wishing I was back there

16:29.849 --> 16:31.615
in that crappy house,

16:31.684 --> 16:34.518
with my sweet husband
and his stupid trains.

16:36.255 --> 16:37.554
Damn.

16:37.623 --> 16:38.922
Viv.

16:38.991 --> 16:41.058
It just got real.

16:41.127 --> 16:43.227
Now I'm with a guy who doesn't care

16:43.295 --> 16:45.329
if I'm involved in his life or not.

16:45.398 --> 16:47.898
I got to stop being such a bitch.

16:47.967 --> 16:52.202
And go home to my crappy house,
my sweet husband,

16:52.271 --> 16:55.472
and his stupid camping.

16:55.541 --> 16:57.174
Yeah, you do.

16:59.000 --> 17:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here

17:22.701 --> 17:24.134
It's not that funny.

17:24.203 --> 17:25.335
I brought wood.

17:25.404 --> 17:26.303
Where'd you get it?

17:26.372 --> 17:27.538
I looted it.

17:27.606 --> 17:29.940
Looting is legal in time of crisis.

17:30.009 --> 17:32.109
Oh, it's so nice in there.

17:32.178 --> 17:33.977
Look at that. See?

17:34.046 --> 17:35.946
Good thing I bought all those Swiffers.

17:37.950 --> 17:39.249
What happened to your hand?

17:39.318 --> 17:41.118
Ah, whittling accident.

17:41.187 --> 17:42.319
Happens.

17:42.388 --> 17:45.088
We bandaged it with
tree sap and a maxi-pad,

17:45.157 --> 17:46.223
the nighttime kind.

17:46.292 --> 17:47.624
That is amazing.

17:49.228 --> 17:51.261
You know, you don't have to be here.

17:51.330 --> 17:53.430
No. I do.

17:53.499 --> 17:57.367
We got married to be together
and to do stuff.

17:57.436 --> 18:00.838
And there's good stuff and
there's crappy stuff, like this.

18:00.906 --> 18:02.172
But we're partners.

18:02.241 --> 18:03.440
And you can't do what's best for you

18:03.509 --> 18:05.809
and screw over your partner.

18:05.878 --> 18:08.011
The fact that Viv is the one
that made me realize that

18:08.080 --> 18:10.347
is really freaking me out.

18:10.416 --> 18:14.251
So, do you accept my apology?

18:15.521 --> 18:18.155
No.

18:18.224 --> 18:20.757
What do you mean, "No"?

18:20.826 --> 18:22.726
You have to earn your keep around here.

18:22.795 --> 18:25.629
Okay. Great. Perfect. What can I do?

18:25.698 --> 18:27.364
We still need the snow latrine.

18:27.433 --> 18:30.267
Yes.

18:30.336 --> 18:31.535
Yes, we do.

18:31.604 --> 18:33.383
I'm on it. How deep?

18:33.506 --> 18:36.673
If you have to ask, "How deep?"
you haven't gone deep enough.

19:01.166 --> 19:02.766
Where's my money?

19:02.835 --> 19:05.102
- Right here.
- What is this?

19:05.170 --> 19:07.237
This is all my savings.
I want you to have it.

19:07.306 --> 19:08.605
So you can go back to Guatemala.

19:08.674 --> 19:10.240
- El Salvador.
- El Salvador.

19:12.578 --> 19:14.111
Why are you doing this for me?

19:14.179 --> 19:15.846
We're partners.

19:15.915 --> 19:18.949
You don't screw over your partner.

19:19.018 --> 19:21.451
You stupid Westport boy.

19:29.562 --> 19:30.861
I'll miss you, Luz.

19:30.930 --> 19:33.730
I wish I could say the same.

19:33.799 --> 19:36.500
I'm also gonna miss that.

19:36.569 --> 19:39.703
Look who helped me dig
a toilet in the cold, hard earth

19:39.772 --> 19:41.438
with a plastic dustpan.

19:41.507 --> 19:43.974
And I brought the fish back.

19:45.377 --> 19:46.410
Oh, power's on.

19:50.182 --> 19:52.215
Mind if I join you guys?

19:52.284 --> 19:54.017
Whatever happened to this
not being your thing?

19:54.086 --> 19:56.887
I'm really sorry.

19:56.956 --> 19:59.690
I was being selfish,
and whatever Mom said

19:59.758 --> 20:02.426
when she screwed up,
can I just piggyback on that?

20:02.494 --> 20:03.860
Smart.

20:03.929 --> 20:05.195
That was good stuff.

20:05.264 --> 20:06.797
Taco in a bag?

20:06.865 --> 20:08.131
What? No.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.099
Ew.

20:13.119 --> 20:14.923
Sorry I made you dig a fake latrine.

20:15.002 --> 20:17.423
Sorry I actually used it
and the neighbors saw me.

20:22.330 --> 20:24.463
- Oh, Viv sent you a text.
- Oh, what does it say?

20:24.532 --> 20:26.399
It's a picture.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.371
Why would she send you that?

20:35.109 --> 20:36.676
She wasn't lying.

20:36.744 --> 20:39.011
Smooth as a seal.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.980
Okay.
