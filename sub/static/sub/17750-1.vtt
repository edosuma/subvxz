00:29.893 --> 00:32.453
Hey, Josh, Josh, Josh! This is Kyle.

00:32.789 --> 00:33.789
Oh, hey, Kyle.

00:33.789 --> 00:36.093
This is my boyfriend.

00:39.253 --> 00:41.093
- We kissed.
- Oh!

00:41.094 --> 00:43.813
- Should we kiss?
- Oh, we don't have to.

00:43.814 --> 00:45.334
I'm not so busy.

00:49.014 --> 00:52.051
Oh, girls. That's enough of that shit.

01:23.399 --> 01:25.349
Arnold trapped this boy for
us, and I want you to see him.

01:25.349 --> 01:27.551
Oh, I thought you were a robber.

01:27.552 --> 01:28.739
I'm not a robber. I'm Kyle.

01:28.739 --> 01:30.911
He is a robber, come
to steal our hearts.

01:30.912 --> 01:33.150
- Turn the light on. I can't see him.
- No.

01:33.787 --> 01:35.879
Oh, Kyle, you're so dreamy!

01:35.881 --> 01:37.742
You're like an actual dream.

01:38.147 --> 01:40.694
You definitely like
Arnold more than Josh.

01:40.694 --> 01:42.236
No. No.

01:42.239 --> 01:43.718
I feel like maybe he did at first,

01:43.718 --> 01:45.677
but then I was very funny in the taxi.

01:45.679 --> 01:47.197
Was he funny in the taxi?

01:47.197 --> 01:49.918
- You weren't funny.
- Yeah, he was funny.

01:49.918 --> 01:52.037
Has anyone shown this
kid some hospitality?

01:52.039 --> 01:54.078
Has anyone offered you
some tea or something?

01:54.078 --> 01:55.278
He doesn't want tea.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.950
Are you sure? I'd like some tea.

01:56.953 --> 01:59.173
- Oh, no, I'm good.
- Please go.

01:59.174 --> 01:59.837
Yes.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.037
It's weird, because I don't
want to be in the threesome,

02:02.039 --> 02:03.878
but I do feel very left out.

02:03.879 --> 02:05.718
You can do your own sex.

02:05.718 --> 02:07.278
Oh!

02:07.278 --> 02:09.758
- This is no way to live.
- Goodnight.

02:38.169 --> 02:39.437
I'm just going to get John out

02:39.437 --> 02:41.341
because sometimes he can
be such a little creep.

02:41.342 --> 02:42.437
Can't you, buddy?

02:43.971 --> 02:46.676
- Keep John innocent.
- Jonathan Taylor Thomas!

02:46.679 --> 02:47.919
That's not his name.

03:18.799 --> 03:19.729
Oh!

03:33.151 --> 03:36.117
Just a little... just a little thirsty.

03:48.453 --> 03:49.758
They can only see each other.

03:49.758 --> 03:51.680
I thought maybe one of
you could stand in there

03:51.681 --> 03:52.675
and see if they notice?

03:52.676 --> 03:54.971
- Maybe it's just not your turn yet.
- You're so impatient.

03:54.972 --> 03:56.229
What have you been doing?

03:56.229 --> 03:59.997
Well, I tried to wriggle in
the middle, but that was hard.

03:59.997 --> 04:02.223
So then I lay there
alone and nobody noticed.

04:02.224 --> 04:05.763
So then I stood in the hallway and
waited for my erection to go down.

04:05.764 --> 04:07.241
And then I came in here.

04:07.242 --> 04:08.770
- Would you like a hug?
- No.

04:08.771 --> 04:10.603
Gross, don't touch
him. He has sex on him.

04:10.604 --> 04:12.836
No, he doesn't, Tom. Have
you even been listening?

04:14.372 --> 04:17.641
I mean, I just... I just can never
get used to your underarm hair.

04:17.644 --> 04:19.824
- Don't, Josh.
- I know, I know, I know!

04:19.824 --> 04:24.927
But it's just very... When I
see it, I just feel very... yuck.

04:24.927 --> 04:26.721
Please do not make me angry at you

04:26.721 --> 04:28.485
when you have got nowhere else to go.

04:28.487 --> 04:31.242
I'm on board, you know,
I love feminism, you know.

04:31.244 --> 04:33.242
I basically am feminism.

04:33.244 --> 04:34.802
Just absolutely don't believe you.

04:34.802 --> 04:36.850
I will never open a door for you.

04:36.850 --> 04:40.199
- Never. Not ever.
- Stroke it.

04:40.199 --> 04:42.134
I wouldn't stroke it smooth
and it won't stroke it hairy.

04:42.136 --> 04:44.266
Josh, I really just think
you need to stroke it.

04:46.759 --> 04:49.365
Yeah, I mean, I really... I
really, like, literally thought

04:49.367 --> 04:50.882
I was gonna spend this
time having a threesome.

04:50.884 --> 04:51.971
You're thinking too much.

04:51.973 --> 04:55.242
Just go back in there with your eyes
closed and follow your instincts.

04:55.244 --> 04:57.434
Oh, please, where did
my instincts ever get us?

04:57.435 --> 05:00.687
That time you said that the beach
wouldn't be fun, and it wasn't fun.

05:03.843 --> 05:05.682
Where did you go? Why did you leave?

05:05.684 --> 05:09.083
I just started to feel a
bit creepy, just staring.

05:09.084 --> 05:10.293
Don't be silly.

05:10.295 --> 05:11.790
I thought you must have been
feeling sick or something.

05:11.790 --> 05:15.257
Nope. I was talking to Ella
about her underarm hair.

05:15.259 --> 05:17.742
- Where's Kyle?
- He's in the shower.

05:17.744 --> 05:21.060
Oh, no. This is just going to be
so hard to explain why you left.

05:21.062 --> 05:22.901
That's such a weird thing to do, Josh.

05:26.382 --> 05:30.343
Hey. Sorry, we finished
without you. Where did you go?

05:31.144 --> 05:32.896
I was feeling sick.

05:32.898 --> 05:35.456
Yep, I was just
feeling... just real sick.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.290
Oh, really? That's no good.

05:37.290 --> 05:39.103
I've got a bit of a flu
at the moment as well.

05:39.103 --> 05:41.060
- It must be going around.
- Yeah.

05:41.062 --> 05:43.836
You're probably sick too. That's it.

05:45.824 --> 05:50.583
- Hey, do you want my Facebook?
- Oh, I don't have Facebook.

05:51.209 --> 05:52.343
Okay.

05:53.915 --> 05:56.663
Well, my car's here, so...

05:57.449 --> 05:58.824
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:06.206 --> 06:08.120
- See you.
- Bye.

06:09.278 --> 06:11.062
You really should get
vaccinated, you know.

06:11.062 --> 06:12.983
The flu might not seem
like such a big deal to you,

06:12.983 --> 06:15.742
but then you could become a carrier,
and if you hang out with your grandma

06:15.744 --> 06:17.858
or say, an infant, then they might die.

06:24.336 --> 06:26.862
Yeah. Can you please turn the light off?

06:44.016 --> 06:46.903
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.543
Uh-oh. I've done a bad thing, haven't I?

06:51.050 --> 06:53.939
I existed and then you got naked
with a boy and then I didn't exist.

06:53.939 --> 06:56.262
No. No, no, no, you exist.

06:56.264 --> 06:59.023
- Look, see?
- I do. I do. I do exist.

06:59.483 --> 07:02.262
Please, please, don't
be mad. I was so drunk.

07:02.262 --> 07:04.463
As far as I remember,
I wasn't there either.

07:04.463 --> 07:05.942
I'm not mad. I got to see him naked.

07:05.944 --> 07:07.858
And I'm just going to
accept that as a win.

07:08.355 --> 07:11.822
Oh, no. Your feelings are hurt. I
feel like I can see your feelings.

07:11.824 --> 07:13.569
Feelings aren't hurt, I promise you.

07:13.571 --> 07:15.442
It's not surprising to find out

07:15.444 --> 07:17.937
that somebody is more attracted
to you than they are to me.

07:18.387 --> 07:20.043
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

07:20.043 --> 07:22.151
I mean, you're allowed to
be mad at me about this.

07:22.153 --> 07:24.177
I'm not mad. It's not your fault.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.701
I've been trying to be more attractive,

07:25.704 --> 07:27.862
but it's just so hard, you
know, because of my genetics.

07:28.367 --> 07:30.987
- Your genetics are heaven.
- Genetics are ISIS.

07:30.990 --> 07:32.449
Well, sign me up then.

07:34.533 --> 07:37.747
- Do you regret saying that?
- Yes. Very much.

07:47.048 --> 07:49.733
Where are you? Why aren't you here?

07:49.733 --> 07:51.720
I'm home alone and I don't like it.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.629
I'm going to Mum's house
because she begged me

07:53.632 --> 07:55.382
and then after that
I'm going to have dinner

07:55.384 --> 07:57.103
with Arnold's parents and Dad and May.

07:57.103 --> 07:59.343
It's the first time I have seen
Arnold's dad since he got angry

07:59.343 --> 08:01.742
that Arnold was gay and smashed
a croquembouche to the ground.

08:01.744 --> 08:03.480
I was talking about this
quite a bit, actually.

08:03.482 --> 08:05.831
We looked his dad up on
Facebook, it's a big whole thing.

08:05.833 --> 08:08.622
We spoke about it a lot.
It is big and memorable.

08:08.624 --> 08:10.103
Oh, yes.

08:10.103 --> 08:12.382
I had some things I
wanted to say about that.

08:12.384 --> 08:13.862
Of course.

08:13.862 --> 08:15.663
I keep having thoughts at night

08:15.663 --> 08:17.603
and I get anxious because I've
got no one to share them with.

08:17.603 --> 08:20.122
- So, I started writing them down.
- Okay.

08:20.124 --> 08:22.403
Oh. I think Arnold's dad might be gay.

08:22.403 --> 08:24.122
He dresses so well.

08:24.124 --> 08:26.641
He doesn't dress well,
he just dresses expensive.

08:26.644 --> 08:28.069
He dresses better than your dad.

08:28.069 --> 08:30.790
I just don't want you to think that
I think that my dad dresses well,

08:30.793 --> 08:33.594
but he absolutely 100% dresses
better than Arnold's dad.

08:33.595 --> 08:35.523
Don't argue, Josh. It's too nice a day.

08:35.524 --> 08:38.123
If I had a choice of going
to this dinner or eating poop,

08:38.124 --> 08:40.003
I would absolutely, of
course, pick the dinner.

08:40.004 --> 08:41.923
But I would pause a
little bit before deciding.

08:41.923 --> 08:44.363
Oh, it's frustrating to think about
all the other thoughts that I had

08:44.364 --> 08:45.738
that I forgot to write down.

08:45.739 --> 08:49.043
- No, no, it isn't.
- Aren't you curious why I called?

08:49.043 --> 08:51.442
You had a thought, you looked around,

08:51.442 --> 08:53.403
there was no one there to
share it with, so you thought,

08:53.403 --> 08:55.533
"Oh, I'll call Josh and tell him."

08:55.533 --> 08:59.123
I bought gluten-free
bread. And it's delicious.

08:59.124 --> 09:01.123
Actually delicious.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.003
I mean, I just cannot
believe that is true.

09:03.004 --> 09:05.163
Hi, Ma. I've got to go,
okay? I'm at Mum's house.

09:05.163 --> 09:07.562
It's too soon, I've got
more thoughts on the bread.

09:07.562 --> 09:09.003
Bye.

09:09.004 --> 09:11.081
Hey, Ma. Hey, Hannah. I'm here.

09:11.082 --> 09:13.643
I'm glad you're here, Josh. Look,
do you want any of these bears?

09:13.644 --> 09:15.243
- Otherwise I'm throwing them out.
- What?

09:15.244 --> 09:17.961
- You're throwing away my teddy bears?
- When are you ever playing with them?

09:17.964 --> 09:19.841
Well, obviously I'm
never playing with them,

09:19.844 --> 09:21.206
but those are like
childhood memories and shit.

09:21.206 --> 09:22.380
Your childhood is over, lovey.

09:22.383 --> 09:24.721
Yeah, real men don't
have memories, Josh.

09:24.724 --> 09:26.841
When was the last time
you ate off these plates?

09:26.844 --> 09:30.201
- I'm going to throw out these plates.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

09:30.202 --> 09:32.123
Look, I can't have
bears in the house, Josh.

09:32.124 --> 09:34.682
People are gonna think I'm
attracting children or something.

09:34.682 --> 09:36.643
What people? I've never
seen a person here.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.283
Me! I'm a person.

09:38.928 --> 09:40.475
Look, do you want to take them or not?

09:40.475 --> 09:41.721
What?

09:41.724 --> 09:44.961
We used to have little tea parties
with these, do you remember that?

09:44.964 --> 09:46.605
Oh, we never did that.

09:46.605 --> 09:49.942
That must have been a movie you
saw. Now, let me throw them away.

09:51.923 --> 09:54.557
- It just all feels very sudden.
- What?

09:54.557 --> 09:57.043
I thought we might give
them to your kids one day,

09:57.043 --> 09:59.072
but obviously you don't want to do that.

10:00.604 --> 10:03.682
Well, don't you want to
remember my childhood?

10:03.682 --> 10:04.899
Not really, no.

10:06.076 --> 10:08.802
All of a sudden, I'm
Andy in Toy Story 3.

10:08.802 --> 10:12.101
Today, Josh. I want this sorted today.

10:12.562 --> 10:15.312
I am finishing this chore today.

11:19.048 --> 11:22.163
Hi, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I caught the bus. I'm an idiot.

11:22.163 --> 11:24.883
- I'm too much of a risk taker.
- You're 45 minutes late.

11:24.884 --> 11:26.839
- I'm here now.
- I saved you an espresso Martini, Josh.

11:26.840 --> 11:29.355
- Thank you, May. I love you.
- Hello, Josh.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.201
- Hello, Donna. You're looking good.
- Stop flirting.

11:32.202 --> 11:33.682
- Bruce.
- Josh.

11:33.682 --> 11:35.763
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

11:35.764 --> 11:39.283
Good to see you again, mate. Good
we can put things behind us, eh?

11:39.283 --> 11:41.601
Oh, now Bruce is flirting.

11:42.152 --> 11:43.363
What the hell is that?

11:43.364 --> 11:45.961
Mum has decided to throw
out all my old toys today.

11:45.964 --> 11:47.601
Very urgently, apparently.

11:47.604 --> 11:49.601
Your teddy bears? What's
she throwing those out for?

11:49.604 --> 11:51.322
- What are they?
- Josh's teddy bears.

11:51.322 --> 11:54.195
Did you guys not bring your bears today?

11:55.096 --> 11:57.601
I just want to take a moment here
to make sure that everyone knows

11:57.604 --> 12:00.322
Josh has never, ever brought
his teddy bears anywhere, ever.

12:00.322 --> 12:02.010
You like bears, do you, Josh?

12:02.442 --> 12:04.773
No. They're, like... they're,
like, from when I was like 5.

12:04.774 --> 12:06.461
Yeah, Arnold never liked toys.

12:06.461 --> 12:08.379
Yes, I did. I liked toys.

12:08.380 --> 12:10.085
May, we should give them to Grace.

12:10.086 --> 12:13.442
Oh, no. Grace can't have it. It's dirty.

12:13.442 --> 12:16.639
They aren't dirty, are
they, May? Let's not...

12:16.639 --> 12:18.489
He always makes sure to wash his bears

12:18.490 --> 12:20.243
before he takes them
out to a nice dinner.

12:20.244 --> 12:22.682
See, your mother should ask
me about stuff like this.

12:22.682 --> 12:24.089
I'm going to call her tomorrow.

12:24.090 --> 12:26.763
Alan, you don't share
custody of teddy bears, okay?

12:26.764 --> 12:30.043
You should keep them
then, Josh, for your kids.

12:30.043 --> 12:32.721
- I'm not having kids, Dad.
- Bravo.

12:32.721 --> 12:34.369
Grace would like him, wouldn't she?

12:37.004 --> 12:39.086
Oh, Grace prefers cats.

12:39.086 --> 12:41.201
No, she doesn't. She's not a cat person.

12:41.202 --> 12:43.523
She's not anything yet.
We're not cat people, May.

12:43.524 --> 12:46.081
Okay. But we are not
also bad people, huh.

12:46.082 --> 12:47.923
Promise me you won't throw them out.

12:47.923 --> 12:50.216
- I'm not going to.
- Oh, no.

12:50.216 --> 12:52.841
- You really like them, don't you?
- Yeah, they're my...

12:52.844 --> 12:54.961
Arnold wouldn't understand.

12:54.964 --> 12:56.764
Yeah, you keep your bears, mate.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.643
Thanks, Bruce.

12:59.644 --> 13:02.601
So, I'm standing there, and
I don't even know this man.

13:02.604 --> 13:04.370
But I just keep nodding, you know?

13:04.370 --> 13:05.908
She'd never even met him.

13:05.908 --> 13:08.225
- Yeah.
- He thought she was someone else.

13:08.225 --> 13:12.682
Yeah, and then he said... he says to
me, "So what ever happened to Mike?"

13:13.221 --> 13:14.238
This is hilarious.

13:14.239 --> 13:16.365
And I don't know why I did it,

13:16.368 --> 13:19.711
but I just panicked and then I
blurt out of nowhere, "Mike died!"

13:21.187 --> 13:22.124
Jesus.

13:22.908 --> 13:24.923
- Why did you say that?
- I don't know!

13:24.923 --> 13:26.961
It just came out. I don't know.

13:26.964 --> 13:30.682
So then, anyway, he
says, "Oh, I am so sorry.

13:30.682 --> 13:32.129
"It must be awful."

13:32.130 --> 13:34.643
And then he actually started crying.

13:34.644 --> 13:37.004
He was very upset!

13:37.985 --> 13:39.750
I guess I thought it
would be funny to say it

13:39.750 --> 13:41.936
but then, well, I guess I just felt bad.

13:41.937 --> 13:43.385
I bet you did.

13:44.043 --> 13:46.481
- Then what happened?
- That's it.

13:47.024 --> 13:48.363
I thought there was
something after that?

13:48.364 --> 13:49.273
No.

13:50.442 --> 13:53.591
- Poor bloke. He must have felt awful.
- I hope he's okay.

13:54.403 --> 13:55.884
Yeah.

14:02.307 --> 14:04.201
Arnold, what's your brother up tonight?

14:04.701 --> 14:06.163
Why would I know that?

14:06.557 --> 14:10.201
Nothing, probably, or drinking or
pretending to be a lesbian on Tinder

14:10.202 --> 14:12.562
to trick lesbians into
talking sex with him.

14:12.562 --> 14:15.923
No, it would be really good
to get him to meet Alan and May

14:15.923 --> 14:16.817
before he shoots off.

14:16.817 --> 14:19.923
Alan, you and Steve,
you would hit it off.

14:19.923 --> 14:21.643
- Wouldn't they, Don?
- Oh!

14:21.644 --> 14:23.428
- Where's he going?
- Oh, no, thanks, love.

14:23.431 --> 14:25.609
- Steve got a job.
- Wow, I didn't hear about this.

14:25.610 --> 14:27.883
Yeah. Dad got Steve a job in Singapore.

14:27.884 --> 14:30.793
- Good on Steve.
- Wow, that sounds impressive.

14:30.796 --> 14:34.043
- Yeah. And very good coin.
- That's quite good.

14:34.043 --> 14:35.481
Steve's doing quite well, isn't he?

14:35.484 --> 14:38.538
Oh, we're all thrilled.
Shocked, but thrilled.

14:38.538 --> 14:40.394
- Are you thrilled, Arnold?
- Yep.

14:40.397 --> 14:43.322
Yeah? You must be very proud of him.

14:43.322 --> 14:46.883
- Yeah, it's great.
- It's a bit weird you didn't tell me.

14:48.836 --> 14:51.216
- I did tell you.
- Did you?

14:51.219 --> 14:54.253
I think I would have
remembered such good news.

14:54.254 --> 14:56.601
I definitely... I definitely told you.

14:58.844 --> 15:01.601
Arnold, are you still hungry?
Do you want anything else?

15:01.604 --> 15:03.442
No, I'm fine. I'm fine, thanks, May.

15:04.524 --> 15:06.883
Look at him, just furious.

15:06.884 --> 15:08.363
Josh, stop it.

15:08.364 --> 15:11.163
No, he's always been a little
bit jealous of his older brother.

15:11.163 --> 15:14.562
I'm not jealous. What's so
incredible about Singapore?

15:14.562 --> 15:16.043
He'll be making a lot of money.

15:16.043 --> 15:19.403
Just raking it in, drinking
cognac and playing golf,

15:19.403 --> 15:21.043
and being on various boats.

15:23.129 --> 15:23.961
What?

15:23.964 --> 15:26.326
I just want to hear you say that
you're happy for your brother.

15:26.327 --> 15:28.523
- I did.
- Did you, though?

15:28.524 --> 15:32.163
Yeah, of course I'm fucking
happy for my dumb fucking brother.

15:32.163 --> 15:34.128
Just ease up, Arnold.

15:40.606 --> 15:45.363
Well, apparently the
average penis in shorter now.

15:45.364 --> 15:48.043
Yeah, it's only about six inches.

15:48.043 --> 15:50.883
Well, they say it's 5.17 now.

15:50.884 --> 15:53.043
- How long is that?
- Oh.

15:53.825 --> 15:55.883
I mean, I don't know how it got smaller,

15:55.884 --> 15:58.120
or did we just get better
at keeping men honest?

16:00.086 --> 16:03.504
That generation just finds
sex things so fucking funny.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.721
I reckon Internet porn
ruined that for us.

16:05.724 --> 16:07.363
It's nice. They're having fun.

16:07.364 --> 16:09.841
- Are you mad at me?
- I'm fine.

16:10.298 --> 16:12.322
I mean, it's just
you're being quite awful.

16:13.442 --> 16:15.004
- I'm being awful?
- Yeah.

16:15.004 --> 16:17.163
- What was that inside?
- I was just playing.

16:17.163 --> 16:18.643
I'm a fun guy, remember?

16:18.644 --> 16:20.643
I just don't know why you
always have to make fun of me.

16:21.129 --> 16:22.322
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

16:22.322 --> 16:24.542
- No. Josh, Josh.
- Hey. Sweet pea.

16:24.543 --> 16:26.980
- They'll see us.
- They're not going to see us here.

16:26.980 --> 16:29.403
Just kiss me on the
mouth. Come over here.

16:31.898 --> 16:34.662
I don't want to kiss
with my parents watching.

16:39.383 --> 16:40.407
Hey?

16:41.364 --> 16:44.283
Oh! Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

16:44.941 --> 16:47.283
Fuck. Shit.

16:47.283 --> 16:48.883
Oh, is everything okay, Bruce?

16:48.884 --> 16:51.302
Yeah, no, I just... just disturbed

16:51.303 --> 16:53.003
the boys having a bit
of a cuddle, that's all.

16:53.004 --> 16:54.841
It's going to take him
months to repress that.

16:54.844 --> 16:57.243
- Come on.
- You never listen to me, Josh.

16:57.244 --> 17:00.043
You make fun of me all the time
and now you think I'm awful.

17:00.043 --> 17:02.721
- I didn't say you were awful.
- You literally just said it.

17:02.724 --> 17:05.442
- I said you were being awful.
- You're humiliating me.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.761
You used to think I was a fun, nice guy.

17:07.762 --> 17:09.481
And if I overstepped the mark, you'd
give me the benefit of the doubt.

17:09.482 --> 17:12.182
- But now...
- Trouble in paradise.

17:12.182 --> 17:15.721
It's reassuring to know that gay
people are as miserable as we are.

17:17.124 --> 17:20.961
Do you know how tiring it is being
teased all the time? All the time?

17:20.962 --> 17:23.605
You used to follow me
around the house like John,

17:23.605 --> 17:25.761
but now you don't even notice if I
leave in the middle of a threesome.

17:25.762 --> 17:27.721
Are you actually mad
about the Kyle thing,

17:27.722 --> 17:29.278
or are you just saying
that to make me feel bad?

17:29.278 --> 17:32.396
- It's a pretty weird thing to do.
- I understand that I'm weird, Josh.

17:32.397 --> 17:34.603
I'm a very fucking weird guy.

17:34.604 --> 17:37.557
But I would like to know
if my boyfriend is upset.

17:37.558 --> 17:39.961
- Everyone's listening.
- You always do this.

17:39.962 --> 17:40.954
You say you don't care

17:40.957 --> 17:43.269
and then you hold onto it to
win a bigger argument later.

17:43.269 --> 17:44.248
It's so manipulative.

17:44.249 --> 17:48.083
You put your feelings on credit
and make me pay for them later.

17:48.084 --> 17:50.007
That's a weird little analogy
you've been working on there.

17:50.008 --> 17:51.759
I mean, why couldn't you
be honest this morning?

17:51.759 --> 17:53.843
I was trying to keep the
peace, but now that I know

17:53.844 --> 17:55.685
you're not interested in keeping
the peace, I'm trying to win.

17:55.688 --> 17:58.277
It's not my fault Kyle didn't
want to have sex with you.

17:58.278 --> 18:01.241
Maybe if you weren't so
obnoxious to the taxi driver.

18:01.242 --> 18:02.787
Josh is right, we can all hear you.

18:06.084 --> 18:07.239
Thanks, Dad.

18:09.601 --> 18:11.509
I'm just gonna let what
you just said slide.

18:11.509 --> 18:12.778
You're doing it again.

18:13.868 --> 18:14.819
Okay.

18:19.730 --> 18:22.298
- I don't want to go inside.
- No.

18:24.695 --> 18:27.403
- Let's just get it over with.
- Yeah.

18:34.202 --> 18:35.191
Mm.

18:57.202 --> 19:00.041
- Hi.
- Are we friends anymore?

19:00.044 --> 19:02.843
- This is a bit much.
- I know.

19:02.844 --> 19:05.070
- I've just been very busy.
- Yeah?

19:05.073 --> 19:07.241
I've also been busy. Do you
think I haven't been busy?

19:07.242 --> 19:11.083
I've just been very busy, okay.
Working and, like, with living.

19:11.084 --> 19:12.750
Like, living heaps, actually.

19:12.750 --> 19:16.201
Hey, goji berries are stupid, yeah?

19:16.202 --> 19:18.769
Like, they're no better
than any other dried fruit.

19:18.769 --> 19:21.420
All superfoods are just normal
foods with a better narrative.

19:21.421 --> 19:25.084
See, Josh also can't understand
how a physicist could be fooled

19:25.085 --> 19:27.229
into thinking that
goji berries are magic.

19:27.230 --> 19:29.365
- Hi, Warren.
- I'm not passing that on.

19:29.365 --> 19:31.201
He's annoying me right now.

19:31.202 --> 19:32.843
Maybe you just don't like me anymore.

19:32.844 --> 19:35.803
That's fine. That's understandable.
Okay, I've never really liked me.

19:35.804 --> 19:37.564
Do you really need me
to say that I like you?

19:38.182 --> 19:41.116
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I like you.

19:41.117 --> 19:42.682
Did Tom do something
creepy? Is that what this is?

19:42.682 --> 19:44.842
I can see you without Tom
there, if that's what you need.

19:44.843 --> 19:48.123
No, Tom hasn't been a part of my
decision-making for like two years.

19:48.124 --> 19:50.603
I've just been hanging out with
Warren. He lives next to a park.

19:50.604 --> 19:51.712
It's very shady.

19:51.713 --> 19:54.403
Warren is literally
the most horrible name.

19:54.403 --> 19:55.621
What are you doing this week?

19:55.622 --> 19:57.961
I just could not
imagine kissing a Warren.

19:57.962 --> 19:59.615
- Let's hang out this week.
- No.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.671
You don't want to. You'll cancel
and forget. Honestly, it's fine.

20:01.672 --> 20:03.624
We can get best friend forever tattoos.

20:03.625 --> 20:06.001
Okay. I don't need you, you know?

20:06.002 --> 20:08.883
There's a lot of girls out there
looking for a gay best friend.

20:08.884 --> 20:11.410
See? No one else gets
to talk to me like that.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.761
When we're 50, we'll have
dinner and we'll laugh

20:13.762 --> 20:16.123
and everything will be exactly
the same as it's always been.

20:16.124 --> 20:17.272
Meanwhile, I can't figure out

20:17.275 --> 20:19.430
if Arnold hates me or
if I hate Arnold, so...

20:19.431 --> 20:21.563
- Honey? I need a towel.
- I have to go.

20:22.082 --> 20:24.044
- Of course. Bye.
- Bye.

20:37.411 --> 20:38.644
What have you made?

20:39.723 --> 20:41.683
Chocolate quinoa slice.

20:42.741 --> 20:46.201
You made a special gluten-free
treat? That's pretty cute.

20:53.124 --> 20:54.324
Oh, my God.

20:54.325 --> 20:56.564
- Is it all right?
- It is so delicious.

21:00.804 --> 21:02.803
Why are you being weird?

21:02.804 --> 21:05.163
Okay, I need you to eat that
slice while I talk for a bit.

21:05.163 --> 21:06.143
Okay.

21:06.144 --> 21:08.817
Okay, I've been kind of
annoyed ever since you moved in.

21:08.818 --> 21:11.241
And I think it's because
when it was just Josh and me,

21:11.242 --> 21:13.363
I didn't care if I was
a good person or not.

21:13.364 --> 21:15.001
But now you've moved in

21:15.002 --> 21:18.041
and I've started noticing just
how far I've let that slip.

21:18.044 --> 21:22.374
I've started noticing lots of
things, like I'm always slouching.

21:22.375 --> 21:25.083
I constantly look like I've
just lost custody of the kids.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.883
I've never bought
shampoo. Always Josh's.

21:27.884 --> 21:30.041
No idea what I look like
without extra volume.

21:30.044 --> 21:32.285
I am not enrolled to vote.

21:33.044 --> 21:35.304
And I am way too friendly
with that guy at 7-Eleven.

21:35.673 --> 21:39.297
And I'm panicking now because I
want to be a better person for you,

21:39.298 --> 21:41.346
but I don't know how to do that

21:41.346 --> 21:44.951
while I'm living with a friend
who prefers it if I'm shit.

21:45.326 --> 21:49.106
So, what I'm asking you is if you
would like to move out with me,

21:49.107 --> 21:50.846
but it is a bad idea

21:50.846 --> 21:54.163
and you should eat that slice
rather than answering, thank you.

21:54.779 --> 21:56.123
- Um.
- What are you doing?

21:56.124 --> 21:58.047
Why are you talking?
You don't need to talk.

21:58.839 --> 22:01.041
- Gosh.
- You don't need to talk at all.

22:01.712 --> 22:03.201
- Tom.
- Don't talk.

22:03.202 --> 22:04.682
- Tom.
- Be quiet.

22:04.682 --> 22:05.772
- No.
- No, you don't need to.

22:05.775 --> 22:09.750
Tom! Yes! Yeah. Yeah,
good. Yeah, let's do it.

22:09.751 --> 22:12.750
Okay. Wow.

22:14.096 --> 22:15.770
Well, that's good news.

22:17.574 --> 22:18.594
When?

22:19.923 --> 22:22.001
- I don't know.
- Hello, friends!

22:22.002 --> 22:24.501
Josh! We're moving out.

22:24.502 --> 22:26.123
We literally just had that conversation,

22:26.124 --> 22:28.201
literally just before
you walked in the door.

22:28.202 --> 22:30.241
Oh, no, I have had it
up to here with things.

22:30.242 --> 22:31.961
This is not a whole big thing, though.

22:31.962 --> 22:34.001
It is a big thing, isn't
it? You two are moving out.

22:34.002 --> 22:35.883
This little world that
we've created is dead.

22:35.884 --> 22:38.281
And now I have to create a whole
new little world and that just...

22:38.284 --> 22:41.363
That seems like a pretty big
thing. Here you go, buddy.

22:41.364 --> 22:43.923
I don't like it when you
put it like that, do I?

22:43.923 --> 22:45.721
When you say this little world is dead.

22:45.722 --> 22:47.009
You guys are going to go and have a baby

22:47.009 --> 22:48.367
and you're gonna stop
being friends with me.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.825
Whoa, whoa! We're not having a baby.

22:50.826 --> 22:53.201
Absolutely, absolutely,
you're going to get pregnant,

22:53.202 --> 22:55.442
because you're lousy with condoms,
and you're going to realise

22:55.442 --> 22:56.750
that your whole life
has been building up

22:56.751 --> 22:58.722
to what's really important,
which is your baby.

22:58.723 --> 23:02.384
Matilda. Probably Matilda.
What am I gonna have?

23:02.384 --> 23:04.720
We're not going to stop being
friends with you if we have a baby.

23:04.721 --> 23:06.481
Absolutely, 100% you would.

23:06.482 --> 23:07.902
How many times have you
heard people say that?

23:07.903 --> 23:10.643
"What are we going to talk about
after you have a baby? Your baby?"

23:10.644 --> 23:11.979
I don't wanna talk about your baby.

23:11.980 --> 23:14.510
We are literally having
zero babies, so...

23:15.044 --> 23:16.728
It will give you and Arnold more space.

23:16.729 --> 23:19.338
- I think Arnold hates me.
- Arnold doesn't hate you, Josh.

23:19.339 --> 23:21.462
I'm sick of things ending. Like,
it's sad how Harry Potter finished.

23:21.463 --> 23:24.636
It's awful to think about how
Leonardo DiCaprio isn't hot anymore.

23:25.325 --> 23:29.201
I was never hot. He was so
hot and now he is just normal.

23:29.202 --> 23:32.173
That same shift is going to happen
to me, but I never started hot.

23:33.243 --> 23:35.190
- Where's the baba ganoush?
- In the bin.

23:35.190 --> 23:36.721
- It was off.
- I never got to taste it.

23:36.722 --> 23:38.563
Now I have to buy new dip.
It's just another thing!

23:38.564 --> 23:40.603
Just because you're gay doesn't
mean you can't have a baby.

23:40.604 --> 23:41.519
I don't want to have a baby.

23:41.519 --> 23:43.382
The problem here isn't me
not being able to have a baby,

23:43.383 --> 23:44.873
it's everybody else
having to have a baby.

23:44.874 --> 23:47.663
That's the next big thing. That's
the new frontier for people our age.

23:47.663 --> 23:51.461
What have I got left? Nothing.
I've tried everything good.

23:51.461 --> 23:53.047
I've tried everything good.

23:53.048 --> 23:54.578
Life is meant to get
boring as you get older

23:54.579 --> 23:56.223
so it's not so
disappointing when you die.

23:56.227 --> 23:58.218
I read ketamine is the next big drug.

23:58.219 --> 24:00.655
Ketamine. It's horse tranquilliser.

24:00.655 --> 24:03.443
I'm going to be another
single mid-30s homosexual,

24:03.444 --> 24:05.201
high on ketamine

24:05.202 --> 24:07.083
with just so much spare money

24:07.084 --> 24:10.075
and then I'm going to
buy myself a beach house

24:10.076 --> 24:11.403
and then that's going to go underwater

24:11.403 --> 24:14.305
because on top of every other
nice thing, weather is ending too.

24:15.482 --> 24:17.323
- I feel sick.
- Don't make it worse.

24:17.324 --> 24:19.241
Talking about things doesn't help.

24:20.538 --> 24:21.805
I don't like this slice.

24:22.305 --> 24:28.400
