01:15.333 --> 01:16.876
Hello. Am I on time?

01:16.877 --> 01:19.099
ID, please.

01:20.630 --> 01:23.674
Let me ask you,
my ticket was paid by a company,

01:23.675 --> 01:26.621
can I get the miles?

01:26.970 --> 01:30.222
No, there are no miles for this fare.

01:30.223 --> 01:33.170
l see. Never mind, then.

01:33.268 --> 01:35.852
Boarding is through gate 3.

01:36.146 --> 01:37.437
Thanks.

02:01.087 --> 02:02.171
I´ll help you.

02:02.172 --> 02:03.350
Fine.

02:35.705 --> 02:37.566
Business or pleasure?

02:38.375 --> 02:40.545
Both, I hope.

02:42.504 --> 02:43.682
What do you do?

02:44.798 --> 02:46.400
l´m a model.

02:48.593 --> 02:50.719
Sorry, I should have figured.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.115
Thank you.

02:53.390 --> 02:54.974
Catwalk or advertising?

02:54.975 --> 02:56.421
Catwalk.

03:01.147 --> 03:03.691
And you, what do you do sir?

03:03.692 --> 03:05.734
- You´re killing me.
- Why?

03:05.735 --> 03:06.735
You said ´´sir´´

03:06.736 --> 03:10.821
and I sank
to the fifth circle of hell.

03:10.865 --> 03:14.225
l have to do something
about my hair.

03:15.286 --> 03:19.061
l´m a music critic.
Sounds horrible, I know.

03:19.582 --> 03:22.334
It doesn´t.
Rock?

03:22.335 --> 03:24.558
Now you´re trying to be nice.

03:25.338 --> 03:26.785
Classical music.

03:28.425 --> 03:29.675
I see.

03:29.676 --> 03:32.219
My first boyfriend
was a classical musician.

03:32.220 --> 03:34.972
Well, that´s what he studied.

03:34.973 --> 03:36.098
What´s his name?

03:36.099 --> 03:38.684
No, he´s not famous.

03:38.685 --> 03:42.604
He sent in some works
back when we were together,

03:42.605 --> 03:45.448
but they were never published.

03:45.483 --> 03:48.527
Or printed.
What´s the right word?

03:48.528 --> 03:53.428
Choose whatever term you like
and l´ll make it popular.

03:55.160 --> 03:58.468
Pasternak. Gabriel Pasternak.

04:03.668 --> 04:05.684
Pasternak...

04:08.256 --> 04:12.217
lf I´d known it, l´d have told you
I was a gravedigger, not a critic.

04:12.218 --> 04:15.596
He submitted his thesis
at the Conservatory of Music

04:15.597 --> 04:19.099
when I was president of the jury.
l ripped him apart.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.101
Yes, I was with him at the time.

04:21.102 --> 04:22.770
What you did to him was awful.

04:22.771 --> 04:25.689
He spent a week in bed
after reading the review.

04:25.690 --> 04:29.026
Sometimes I have to destroy
some poor guy´s self-esteem

04:29.027 --> 04:31.820
to protect the ears
of an entire population.

04:31.821 --> 04:35.074
I may be wrong sometimes,
but in this case...

04:35.075 --> 04:37.504
His work was...

04:38.369 --> 04:41.679
a dreadful monstrosity.

04:41.748 --> 04:43.749
Are you still in touch with him?

04:43.750 --> 04:46.043
We didn´t end on great terms.

04:46.044 --> 04:48.879
But l´m still fond of him.
He was a good guy.

04:48.880 --> 04:53.008
Maybe, but if you present
a piece like that to a jury

04:53.009 --> 04:55.761
there has to be
something wrong with you.

04:55.762 --> 04:58.680
Gabriel Pasternak!
How could I forget him?

04:58.681 --> 05:01.266
We laughed about it for months.

05:01.267 --> 05:06.167
l´m sorry to interrupt,
but I was listening to you.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.693
What a huge coincidence!

05:08.858 --> 05:11.443
Gabriel Pasternak
was my student

05:11.444 --> 05:13.667
at Palomar Elementary School.

05:14.989 --> 05:19.743
I had to tell him
he was being held back.

05:19.744 --> 05:23.455
I can assure you:
the kid had issues.

05:23.456 --> 05:26.542
l´ve never seen anything like it
in 30 years as a teacher.

05:26.543 --> 05:28.168
He was screaming

05:28.169 --> 05:31.380
and crying like a newborn baby.

05:31.381 --> 05:33.500
Miss Leguizamón?

05:34.217 --> 05:36.233
lgnacio Fontana.
Remember me?

05:37.053 --> 05:39.689
lgnacio Fontana!

05:39.848 --> 05:43.642
Unbelievable!
There´s a cosmic connection here.

05:43.643 --> 05:47.521
Wasn´t Pasternak one of your classmates?

05:47.522 --> 05:51.024
- Are you friends with him?
- Intimate friends.

05:51.025 --> 05:53.902
Poor guy, we were awful to him.

05:53.903 --> 05:56.446
This is beyond unbelievable.

05:56.447 --> 05:58.448
I was a manager at Home Depot,

05:58.449 --> 06:01.827
where this psycho you mentioned
worked for a while.

06:01.828 --> 06:05.455
He always had trouble with customers,
so we had to let him go.

06:05.456 --> 06:06.903
- And when I...
- Excuse me.

06:07.917 --> 06:11.128
Does anyone else know Gabriel Pasternak?

06:11.129 --> 06:12.588
- Me.
- Me too.

06:12.589 --> 06:13.767
Why?

06:15.008 --> 06:16.842
Why are you on this plane?

06:16.843 --> 06:18.962
Did you buy your tickets?

06:19.512 --> 06:23.390
l´m in real estate,
they sent it to me to check out a farm.

06:23.391 --> 06:26.018
I have a meeting
with the Tourism Secretary.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.827
They bought the ticket.

06:27.979 --> 06:29.313
l won mine in a raffle.

06:29.314 --> 06:34.214
I couldn´t change the date.
l had to fly today.

06:40.992 --> 06:44.559
Gabriel Pasternak is
the cabin chief on this flight.

06:45.330 --> 06:47.998
We did our training together,
we were friends.

06:47.999 --> 06:51.168
Then he asked me out
and when I refused, he started to get...

06:51.169 --> 06:52.461
Never mind.

06:52.837 --> 06:55.839
After takeoff,
he brought coffee to the cockpit.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.425
The door is locked,
the pilots won´t answer,

06:58.426 --> 07:01.269
I´m desperate!
I don´t know what to do!

07:06.184 --> 07:09.130
I cheated on him
with his only friend.

07:10.355 --> 07:11.801
With him!

07:24.702 --> 07:27.537
Gabriel!
Gabriel, are you there?

07:27.538 --> 07:28.455
It´s Victor,

07:28.456 --> 07:29.915
Victor Jensen!

07:29.916 --> 07:31.416
Talk to me, please!

07:31.417 --> 07:34.378
- Who are you?
- I was his psychiatrist for years.

07:34.379 --> 07:38.090
Then I raised my fees,
he got mad and stopped seeing me.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.633
Open the door, Gabriel!
Listen!

07:39.634 --> 07:43.762
It´s not your fault!
You´re just a victim here!

07:43.763 --> 07:45.681
l´m telling you, plain and simple:

07:45.682 --> 07:48.433
it was your parents
who ruined your life!

07:48.434 --> 07:51.137
They asked too much of you
ever since you were born,

07:51.187 --> 07:54.340
they projected all their
disappointments on you!

07:54.357 --> 07:56.817
They are responsible
for your suffering!

07:56.818 --> 07:59.402
Gabriel, no one here...

07:59.445 --> 08:01.616
has anything to do with it!

09:22.195 --> 09:27.095
WlLD TALES

10:54.454 --> 10:56.469
Good evening.
Party of one?

10:56.539 --> 10:59.434
l see you´re good at math.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.084
One, yes.

11:02.378 --> 11:03.877
Wherever you like.

11:16.559 --> 11:19.102
Today´s special
is lentils and rice stew.

11:19.103 --> 11:20.653
Delicious!

11:43.794 --> 11:45.500
Did he order?

11:49.759 --> 11:53.532
That guy´s from my hometown.

11:53.763 --> 11:57.898
He´s a loan shark, a gangster.

11:58.684 --> 12:01.527
He auctioned our house.

12:01.562 --> 12:05.492
Because of him,
my father killed himself.

12:06.817 --> 12:09.972
Two weeks after the funeral,

12:10.321 --> 12:13.112
he tried to seduce my mom.

12:14.283 --> 12:19.040
He wouldn´t leave her alone
so we moved here.

12:20.873 --> 12:22.541
You know how many times

12:22.542 --> 12:25.281
l dreamed of having him

12:25.753 --> 12:27.872
right in front of me?

12:29.048 --> 12:31.736
I´m going to say something.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.090
Say something?

12:34.845 --> 12:37.097
Your dad kills himself
because of this guy,

12:37.098 --> 12:40.096
and you´re just going
to insult him?

12:40.851 --> 12:44.730
Let´s put rat poison in his food.

12:45.940 --> 12:47.482
There´s some in the storeroom.

12:47.483 --> 12:51.930
A good dose and his heart
will blow in five minutes.

13:02.623 --> 13:04.639
Lots of work?

13:04.834 --> 13:06.626
Not with this weather...

13:06.627 --> 13:09.588
I´ve been trying to get your attention
for a while.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.966
You need to check on
your customers, honey.

13:13.134 --> 13:15.510
Sorry.
Can I take your order?

13:15.511 --> 13:17.554
French fries with fried eggs.

13:17.555 --> 13:20.294
I´ll order something else
if I´m still hungry.

13:23.769 --> 13:26.104
- To drink?
- Diet Coke.

13:26.105 --> 13:27.604
Diet Coke?

13:27.898 --> 13:30.275
Diet Coke.

13:30.276 --> 13:32.360
French fries, fried eggs.

13:32.361 --> 13:34.429
Want me to write it?

13:37.950 --> 13:40.431
I hate him!

13:44.707 --> 13:47.757
Make him French fries with fried eggs.

13:50.129 --> 13:53.696
Are you crazy?
Want me to go to prison?

13:54.050 --> 13:55.548
To prison?

13:56.385 --> 14:00.212
Who´ll do the autopsy on this jerk?
The FBl?

14:00.640 --> 14:02.390
French fries with fried eggs.

14:02.391 --> 14:04.976
They´ll think the cholesterol
killed him.

14:09.273 --> 14:11.754
Just cook his meal, will you?

14:21.202 --> 14:23.244
Can I have your opinion?

14:23.245 --> 14:26.710
You seem like a smart girl.
Come here.

14:29.627 --> 14:32.832
Which do you like better? This one?

14:33.172 --> 14:35.173
CUENCA = SAFETY

14:35.174 --> 14:36.724
Or this one?

14:37.051 --> 14:38.176
The red one.

14:38.177 --> 14:40.244
The red one.
Hold on.

14:43.182 --> 14:45.141
Don´t I look too serious?

14:45.142 --> 14:46.810
No, I think it´s fine.

14:46.811 --> 14:48.361
Thank you.

14:54.318 --> 14:56.861
Besides, prison´s not that bad.

14:56.862 --> 14:59.155
It just has bad reputation.

14:59.156 --> 15:03.118
They feed you, you don´t pay rent,

15:03.119 --> 15:05.537
you have nothing to worry about.

15:05.538 --> 15:09.124
And if you make nice friends,
you can have a good time.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.347
You play cards...

15:11.460 --> 15:13.545
Were you in prison?

15:13.546 --> 15:14.724
A while.

15:15.423 --> 15:18.783
And I felt freer in there than here.

15:18.968 --> 15:20.311
This is shit.

15:20.845 --> 15:22.705
What did you do?

15:23.013 --> 15:25.184
Nothing I regret.

15:29.854 --> 15:32.397
And he´s running for mayor!

15:32.398 --> 15:34.827
That son of a bitch.
Can you believe it?

15:35.234 --> 15:38.695
Of course I can.
Bastards rule the world.

15:38.696 --> 15:40.246
Wake up, kid!

15:42.658 --> 15:43.898
So?

15:44.493 --> 15:47.491
Shall we do the community a favor?

15:52.460 --> 15:53.751
Great!

16:20.488 --> 16:21.934
You did it.

16:23.157 --> 16:26.910
Don´t play naive,
as if you hadn´t noticed.

16:26.911 --> 16:28.357
What?

16:29.872 --> 16:31.080
That´s our country.

16:31.081 --> 16:33.875
Everyone wants these guys
to get what they deserve,

16:33.876 --> 16:37.128
but no one
is willing to lift a finger.

16:37.129 --> 16:39.145
Be proud, kid.

16:39.840 --> 16:44.135
For once in your miserable life,
you´re doing something worthwhile.

16:44.136 --> 16:46.971
- I´m not doing anything.
- You´re not?

16:46.972 --> 16:50.225
You stay here arguing instead of
taking the food away from him.

16:50.226 --> 16:51.828
Relax.

16:51.894 --> 16:53.858
You have nothing to worry about.

16:54.230 --> 16:58.024
If there´s an investigation,
I´ll say I used rat poison in the kitchen

16:58.025 --> 17:01.528
because we were infested,
which is true, by the way,

17:01.529 --> 17:04.030
and some of it,
accidentally fell into a pot.

17:04.031 --> 17:05.840
What will they say?

17:08.202 --> 17:09.907
This is insane.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.566
Could this shit be expired?

17:21.674 --> 17:23.793
There´s no expiration date.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.301
How does it work?

17:25.302 --> 17:30.202
If rat poison is expired,
is it more or less harmful?

17:48.909 --> 17:50.702
- Everything OK?
- Yes.

17:50.703 --> 17:51.994
Have a seat.

18:06.302 --> 18:10.075
- What are you having, Alexis?
- Fanta, maybe?

18:10.264 --> 18:12.724
- Should I warm it up?
- No! Leave it.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.351
lf I need you to warm it up, l´ll ask.

18:15.352 --> 18:17.471
Can I have a Fanta, please?

18:21.984 --> 18:24.051
I´ve had it with this girl.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.118
We have to do something,
they´re both eating.

18:32.119 --> 18:34.370
- Add more poison?
- He´s just a kid!

18:34.371 --> 18:37.123
But he´ll grow up.
Like father, like son.

18:37.124 --> 18:40.277
We´d better wipe out
the whole family tree.

18:43.589 --> 18:46.018
l´m feeling a bit...

18:47.134 --> 18:48.312
What´s wrong?

18:51.055 --> 18:51.930
Are you OK?

18:51.931 --> 18:53.264
This must be freezing cold.

18:53.265 --> 18:55.022
No, stop!

18:55.309 --> 18:58.772
Who the fuck taught you
how to wait tables? Leave.

19:12.493 --> 19:15.995
You goddamned fucking bitch!

19:15.996 --> 19:17.413
Stop it, dad!

19:17.414 --> 19:18.957
Pick everything up.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.404
Pick it up, I said.

19:21.710 --> 19:23.211
Call an ambulance!

19:23.212 --> 19:25.383
Pick them up, one by one!

19:25.923 --> 19:27.266
Take this!

19:28.133 --> 19:30.551
Take this, you thug!

19:30.552 --> 19:34.224
I´ll gut you like a chicken!

21:44.186 --> 21:46.305
Come on, moron, move over.

21:55.572 --> 21:57.640
What´s your problem?

22:04.748 --> 22:07.643
What a piece of shit!

22:18.220 --> 22:20.442
You motherfucking redneck!

22:21.473 --> 22:22.765
Asshole!

22:32.860 --> 22:35.392
Holy Jesus.

23:01.305 --> 23:03.165
l can´t believe it.

24:45.742 --> 24:46.909
Hello.

24:46.910 --> 24:51.810
I´m at Kilometer 60
on the route between Salta and...

24:52.749 --> 24:53.916
Yes, sorry.

24:53.917 --> 24:57.277
UlA719.

24:57.379 --> 24:59.343
Diego Iturralde.

25:00.424 --> 25:01.612
Fine.

25:02.467 --> 25:05.344
I was saying, I have a flat tire,
at Kilometer 60

25:05.345 --> 25:10.245
on the route between
Salta and Cafayate.

25:10.934 --> 25:14.228
I´d like to know,
how quick can you get here?

25:14.229 --> 25:18.883
See, the car´s new
and I´m not handy with the jack.

26:32.974 --> 26:34.318
What´s wrong?

26:34.559 --> 26:36.394
Did you get scared?

26:36.395 --> 26:37.686
Come on, man, drive on.

26:38.855 --> 26:40.768
Keep driving, come on!

27:11.263 --> 27:14.140
Let it go, I don´t want a fight.

27:14.141 --> 27:17.017
If I offended you, I apologize.

27:17.018 --> 27:19.189
l´m sorry if I did.

27:25.735 --> 27:27.234
Are you done?

27:27.904 --> 27:29.403
Are you finished?

27:30.907 --> 27:32.406
Careful with...

27:36.830 --> 27:38.897
What are you... Stop!

27:40.125 --> 27:42.296
Come on, man,
I didn´t do anything.

27:42.335 --> 27:46.420
What was it you called me back there?

28:22.751 --> 28:24.456
Oh God!

28:29.508 --> 28:32.843
l already apologized.
What more do you want?

28:32.844 --> 28:37.343
I´ll get out of the car if I have to,
but I don´t think it´s necessary.

28:37.891 --> 28:39.069
Fuck!

28:39.267 --> 28:40.445
Stop!

28:45.106 --> 28:46.774
Good morning, officer.

28:46.775 --> 28:48.567
I´m at Kilometer 60

28:48.568 --> 28:50.903
of the route
between Salta and Cafayate

28:50.904 --> 28:53.281
and I´m being attacked by a man.

28:53.740 --> 28:55.741
It´s shatterproof, you won´t break it!

28:55.742 --> 28:57.034
You pussy!

28:57.035 --> 28:59.411
The man´s license plate is...

28:59.412 --> 29:04.066
I can´t see it,
can you send a patrol car, please?

29:06.211 --> 29:07.916
Perfect.

29:08.129 --> 29:10.093
Hurry, he´s out of control!

29:14.177 --> 29:17.227
l´m sure they´ll be here any minute.

29:19.474 --> 29:21.850
Give it a rest, man!

29:21.851 --> 29:25.006
You wrecked my car! Get lost!

29:31.027 --> 29:32.578
What are you doing?

29:42.205 --> 29:44.686
Son of a bitch!

29:44.833 --> 29:47.521
You son of a bitch!

29:48.628 --> 29:50.954
Fucking bastard!
Motherfucker!

29:59.180 --> 30:01.144
Please!

30:25.248 --> 30:26.850
Pussy!

31:06.665 --> 31:07.843
What are you doing?

31:11.378 --> 31:12.721
Stop, you prick!

32:25.910 --> 32:27.995
You´re dead!

32:27.996 --> 32:30.382
I have your license plate,
you son of a bitch!

32:30.415 --> 32:31.582
Did you hear me?

32:31.583 --> 32:34.168
I have your license plate! UlA!

32:34.169 --> 32:37.735
l´ll hunt you down and kill you!

33:44.447 --> 33:46.411
Resetting...

37:45.521 --> 37:47.773
Attention, dispatch.
Truck 29 here.

37:47.774 --> 37:49.996
Confirm location, please?

38:14.842 --> 38:17.116
Dispatch, dispatch!

38:30.274 --> 38:33.169
What´s your theory, sheriff?

38:33.402 --> 38:35.263
Crime of passion?

39:21.701 --> 39:23.613
How´s it going outside?

39:23.744 --> 39:25.605
Ready to go, Simón.

40:00.615 --> 40:01.906
Thank you.

40:12.710 --> 40:13.950
Let´s do it.

40:15.546 --> 40:18.493
Attention, we´re detonating!

40:19.091 --> 40:21.883
Five, four...

40:51.749 --> 40:53.299
Good job.

41:03.970 --> 41:05.572
There, please.

41:06.514 --> 41:07.805
Sign.

41:11.018 --> 41:12.413
Yes, honey?

41:13.312 --> 41:18.212
I´ll stop by the office, make a few calls
and be on my way.

41:18.401 --> 41:21.606
l´ll be there at 5 with the cake.

41:21.862 --> 41:26.051
I´ll be there on time, don´t worry.

41:43.759 --> 41:46.137
I hope she likes it.

41:46.554 --> 41:47.721
Yes, she´ll love it.

41:47.722 --> 41:49.065
Thank you.

42:03.112 --> 42:04.921
That´s 360 pesos.

42:05.948 --> 42:07.654
What is it, imported?

42:08.326 --> 42:09.743
One, two...

42:09.744 --> 42:11.077
Do you have a receipt?

42:11.078 --> 42:14.331
Yes, we´ve got cakes, pastries...

42:14.332 --> 42:16.791
A sales slip, a receipt.

42:16.792 --> 42:19.377
Yes, sure, I´ll get it for you.

43:10.596 --> 43:12.819
You gang of thieves!

43:27.405 --> 43:28.645
Next!

43:31.617 --> 43:34.994
Hello. I parked my car...

43:34.995 --> 43:36.701
Car registration, please.

43:42.294 --> 43:44.629
- I don´t like that tone.
- I´m being polite, sir.

43:44.630 --> 43:45.973
l don´t think so.

43:48.384 --> 43:50.343
The towing fee is 490 pesos

43:50.344 --> 43:53.138
and the parking ticket
will be sent to your address.

43:53.139 --> 43:56.182
But l´m trying to explain.

43:56.183 --> 43:58.810
The curb wasn´t painted yellow,

43:58.811 --> 44:01.771
there was no way I could have known

44:01.772 --> 44:03.773
it was a no-parking zone.

44:03.774 --> 44:04.732
I understand.

44:04.733 --> 44:08.445
If you want to get your car back,
you have to pay the towing fee.

44:08.446 --> 44:10.697
Then you can file a complaint
Monday to Friday,

44:10.698 --> 44:15.598
8 to 2 pm, at the DMV,
Carlos Pellegrini 211, 1st floor.

44:18.456 --> 44:21.247
Let´s do something else.

44:21.750 --> 44:24.502
Go and talk to whoever you need to,

44:24.503 --> 44:28.381
l want to leave with my car
without paying a penny,

44:28.382 --> 44:31.342
l want a refund for the cab

44:31.343 --> 44:33.876
and I want an apology.

44:33.929 --> 44:35.680
Why are you laughing?
I´m serious.

44:35.681 --> 44:38.627
Where is the office
where apologies are made?

44:38.684 --> 44:41.941
We´re all in the same boat.
Please hurry up.

44:42.563 --> 44:44.981
The parking ticket
indicates you committed an infraction,

44:44.982 --> 44:46.584
we don´t need further proof.

44:46.859 --> 44:50.278
Once again, if you want your car back,
you need to pay.

44:50.279 --> 44:52.864
Otherwise, please leave
so I can go on working.

44:52.865 --> 44:54.073
lf I don´t have cash?

44:54.074 --> 44:56.743
We accept credit and debit cards,
or come back tomorrow,

44:56.744 --> 44:59.432
but you´ll be charged parking fee.

45:01.415 --> 45:05.035
- You know you´re a criminal?
- l´m doing my job.

45:05.127 --> 45:08.630
People who work for criminals
are criminals too.

45:08.631 --> 45:10.957
Right. That´s your opinion.

45:10.966 --> 45:15.866
Just a miserable slave
to this corrupt system.

45:20.643 --> 45:22.710
Thank you, have a nice day.

45:41.914 --> 45:44.343
Almost there

45:54.802 --> 45:59.352
Don´t bother.
Almost everyone´s gone

46:33.090 --> 46:37.640
Happy birthday, Camila

46:42.808 --> 46:45.392
Happy birthday, precious.

46:47.062 --> 46:48.871
Can´t we do it again?

46:49.315 --> 46:51.485
Forget about it, Simón.

46:52.484 --> 46:55.534
Hello, baby, happy birthday.

46:58.073 --> 46:59.616
Here´s the cake.

46:59.617 --> 47:01.075
Hello, kids.

47:01.076 --> 47:02.744
Hi, Antonio, how are you?

47:02.745 --> 47:03.468
Hello, dear.

47:03.495 --> 47:05.252
- How are you?
- Fine.

47:07.541 --> 47:08.666
We were just leaving.

47:08.667 --> 47:10.321
I´m the father.

47:11.920 --> 47:13.626
I´ll see you out.

47:21.639 --> 47:24.740
Why not get a cab
and pick up the car later?

47:25.392 --> 47:27.894
You missed your daughter´s birthday!

47:27.895 --> 47:31.189
You make it sound so easy.
l´m tired of being robbed!

47:31.190 --> 47:34.757
The curb was not painted yellow!

47:35.027 --> 47:38.279
Do you have any idea
how furious that makes me?

47:38.280 --> 47:40.531
Do you have any idea
how furious it makes me

47:40.532 --> 47:43.076
that you always have an excuse?

47:43.077 --> 47:45.203
That you blame society
for everything?

47:45.204 --> 47:47.705
Today was the tow truck,
yesterday was traffic,

47:47.706 --> 47:49.248
tomorrow it´ll be the rally.

47:49.249 --> 47:52.502
The truth is
you could have left earlier.

47:52.503 --> 47:54.796
You could have helped me set up

47:54.797 --> 47:57.465
and have been here to welcome
your daughter´s friends.

47:57.466 --> 48:01.010
But everything else is a priority
except your family.

48:01.011 --> 48:03.888
And l´m such a fool to think
one day you´ll change.

48:03.889 --> 48:05.439
But you know what?

48:05.557 --> 48:07.767
Society won´t change.

48:07.768 --> 48:09.473
You won´t change.

48:10.312 --> 48:12.121
And l´m tired.

48:15.609 --> 48:17.780
What´s that supposed to mean?

48:18.404 --> 48:22.539
You´re the engineer.
Do the math.

48:24.493 --> 48:27.912
The government allows a company
to rake in the big bucks from these fines.

48:27.913 --> 48:31.843
Obviously,
our elected officials get their cut.

48:32.459 --> 48:34.752
lt´s outrageous,
but that´s how it is.

48:34.753 --> 48:38.840
You have two options:
pay and relax

48:38.841 --> 48:41.839
or you give yourself
a heart attack.

48:43.178 --> 48:44.935
You know what?

48:45.055 --> 48:47.265
l have plenty to live for.

48:47.266 --> 48:50.768
I want to sail, travel around the
world with my grandchildren...

48:50.769 --> 48:52.562
- Don´t get so upset.
- Right.

48:52.563 --> 48:53.854
Take it easy.

49:00.821 --> 49:02.319
Good morning.

49:02.614 --> 49:06.033
I got this ticket.
I already paid the towing fee,

49:06.034 --> 49:09.328
but there´s been a mistake,
the curb wasn´t painted yellow.

49:09.329 --> 49:11.190
- May I?
- Sure.

49:14.126 --> 49:15.521
lt´s 560 pesos.

49:18.672 --> 49:19.922
Listen,

49:19.923 --> 49:24.823
l´m a bit anxious about this,
so please, hear me out.

49:26.472 --> 49:28.539
The curb wasn´t painted.

49:29.475 --> 49:32.894
I think you should send someone
to the address of the infraction

49:32.895 --> 49:35.563
so you can check I´m right.

49:35.564 --> 49:37.899
Then, on behalf of the city government,
you should apologize,

49:37.900 --> 49:39.442
because l´m right,

49:39.443 --> 49:41.736
you should give me back
the towing fees

49:41.737 --> 49:45.822
and compensate me for all the time
I´m wasting.

49:45.908 --> 49:46.949
According to the ticket,

49:46.950 --> 49:49.285
your car
was in a no-parking zone.

49:49.286 --> 49:51.287
That´s proof enough.

49:51.288 --> 49:55.166
The fine is 560 pesos
and you have to pay it either way.

49:55.167 --> 49:58.579
If you don´t,
interests will start accumulating.

49:58.712 --> 50:00.728
Are you listening?

50:01.131 --> 50:03.132
Proof enough my ass!

50:03.133 --> 50:06.552
l´m telling you the curb
was not painted yellow.

50:06.553 --> 50:10.223
First, don´t insult me.
l´m doing my job.

50:10.224 --> 50:13.842
Second, you should know
how the law works.

50:14.061 --> 50:15.770
The fact that you don´t know it

50:15.771 --> 50:19.148
doesn´t mean you can avoid
the consequences for breaking it.

50:19.149 --> 50:22.235
If you kill someone and say:
´´I didn´t know I couldn´t do that, ´´

50:22.236 --> 50:23.528
you go to jail.

50:23.529 --> 50:27.490
Maybe no one told you that,
but you´ll go to jail anyway.

50:27.491 --> 50:28.366
Get the picture?

50:28.367 --> 50:31.369
That example is pretty inaccurate.

50:31.370 --> 50:36.270
I´m supposed to know by heart
where I am not allowed to park,

50:36.375 --> 50:39.085
whether the spaces are marked or not?

50:39.086 --> 50:40.086
Exactly.

50:40.087 --> 50:43.506
That information
is available on the DMV website.

50:43.507 --> 50:44.695
I see.

50:45.133 --> 50:48.344
- Can you call your superior?
- There are none.

50:48.345 --> 50:49.428
Really?

50:49.429 --> 50:52.169
What are you?
The fucking president?

50:52.641 --> 50:54.684
Sir, there´s a lot of people here.

50:54.685 --> 50:58.479
If you´re not going to pay,
please step aside.

50:58.480 --> 51:01.315
How does it feel to be a crook?
Tell me.

51:01.316 --> 51:02.494
Security, window 7!

51:02.609 --> 51:05.142
Security?
Great!

51:05.195 --> 51:06.571
I´m submitting a complaint,

51:06.572 --> 51:09.574
exercising my rights as a citizen,
that makes me a criminal?

51:09.575 --> 51:10.866
Want to call security?

51:13.203 --> 51:14.857
Call security! Go ahead!

51:17.833 --> 51:19.584
Call them now! Do it!

51:19.585 --> 51:22.169
What are you doing?
Get off me!

51:31.680 --> 51:33.437
Sign here, please.

51:51.366 --> 51:53.242
- Hey, buddy.
- How are you?

51:53.243 --> 51:55.466
They didn´t rape you, did they?

51:57.164 --> 51:58.921
This is unbelievable.

51:59.291 --> 52:02.651
This is really... unbelievable.

52:02.794 --> 52:04.190
lt´s crazy.

52:04.463 --> 52:08.215
Seijas sent the company lawyer
to take care of everything.

52:08.216 --> 52:12.715
Finally some goodwill,
because lately...

52:14.431 --> 52:16.933
Maybe that´s not the right word...

52:16.934 --> 52:20.061
Your name is all over the news,

52:20.062 --> 52:22.026
along with the company´s name.

52:22.814 --> 52:26.108
Seijas´s partners aren´t too happy.

52:26.109 --> 52:30.505
The city government
is one of our biggest clients.

52:32.991 --> 52:35.834
They´re letting you go, Simón.

52:37.204 --> 52:39.168
lt´s been decided.

52:41.500 --> 52:44.860
You´re currently unemployed,
Mr. Fischer.

52:45.420 --> 52:47.281
Why, is that a crime?

52:47.756 --> 52:50.185
I never said that.

52:50.842 --> 52:54.720
But it sounded like
that´s what you were implying.

52:54.721 --> 52:57.223
lt´s not a crime,
but it is a problem

52:57.224 --> 53:00.393
when you have to provide
for your family every month.

53:00.394 --> 53:03.104
She´s referring to child support,

53:03.105 --> 53:06.482
which includes clothing,
tuition, medical insurance.

53:06.483 --> 53:07.878
Excuse me.

53:10.195 --> 53:13.865
l´ve supported my wife year round
ever since I met her.

53:14.157 --> 53:16.784
And my daughter will always have
what she needs.

53:16.785 --> 53:19.870
lf I have a problem,
don´t worry, I´ll work it out.

53:19.871 --> 53:23.076
Fortunately my client is now working,

53:23.542 --> 53:28.087
so we don´t see why Mr. Fischer
should have shared custody.

53:28.088 --> 53:29.276
Excuse me.

53:31.216 --> 53:34.719
I´ve been paying for everything
for years.

53:34.720 --> 53:37.888
Just because this month
she´s employed and l´m not,

53:37.889 --> 53:41.934
I don´t have the right
to joint custody of our daughter?

53:41.935 --> 53:45.771
l hope the judge realizes
how unfair this situation is.

53:45.772 --> 53:47.773
What the judge will realize

53:47.774 --> 53:50.067
is how violent you are
when you refer to your wife...

53:50.068 --> 53:52.032
What violence?

53:52.738 --> 53:56.978
I´m describing reality,
where do you see violence?

53:57.075 --> 54:00.369
I see violence all over the place,
Mr. Fischer.

54:00.370 --> 54:02.413
I see violence on the streets,

54:02.414 --> 54:04.915
when I turn on the TV.

54:04.916 --> 54:09.816
And I see violence
in this newspaper article.

54:09.838 --> 54:14.738
I´m convinced that less contact
a child has with this kind of event,

54:14.843 --> 54:17.344
the better it´ll be for her well-being.

54:17.345 --> 54:21.015
Victoria, do you want to take
my daughter away from me?

54:21.016 --> 54:23.309
No, I don´t want to take
your daughter away from you.

54:23.310 --> 54:25.842
What´s wrong?
Are you going crazy?

54:26.313 --> 54:29.190
My client and I are finished here,

54:29.191 --> 54:33.119
we´ll see each other again in court.

54:33.528 --> 54:35.237
You´re not going to say anything?

54:35.238 --> 54:36.363
Are you working for her?

54:36.364 --> 54:38.240
- Get a therapist, Mr. Fischer.
- What?

54:38.241 --> 54:40.154
It´s from the heart.

54:54.591 --> 54:56.675
l´ll talk to you later,
someone´s here.

54:56.676 --> 54:58.072
A kiss.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.064
Hello.

55:00.472 --> 55:05.142
l´m Simón Fischer,
I spoke with Mr. Ederer´s secretary.

55:05.143 --> 55:06.393
I´m supposed to leave my CV.

55:06.394 --> 55:08.437
Sure, l´ll give it to her.

55:08.438 --> 55:11.524
I´d rather give it to her personally,

55:11.525 --> 55:15.402
and if Mr. Ederer´s here,
l´d like to have a word with him.

55:15.403 --> 55:17.488
I worked for over ten years

55:17.489 --> 55:20.157
at Seijas Raffo Martinez and Associates.

55:20.158 --> 55:21.398
I´m not a rookie.

55:21.827 --> 55:23.828
The engineer is on a construction site.

55:23.829 --> 55:24.954
And his secretary?

55:24.955 --> 55:26.970
She´s out for lunch.

55:28.291 --> 55:29.997
It´s 4 pm.

55:30.627 --> 55:32.795
I don´t handle her schedule.

55:32.796 --> 55:34.255
You know what?

55:34.256 --> 55:36.924
l won´t leave a damn thing.

55:36.925 --> 55:40.845
You can all go fuck yourselves:
you, Ederer and his secretary.

55:40.846 --> 55:44.878
Especially his secretary.
Go fuck yourselves.

55:45.225 --> 55:49.517
Lunch at 4 pm?
They must think I´m an idiot!

56:00.615 --> 56:02.734
The blue Chevrolet?

59:15.727 --> 59:17.519
You´re rude.

59:17.520 --> 59:19.226
This is a fascist regime.

59:20.023 --> 59:21.940
I have to pay first and complain later?

59:21.941 --> 59:23.192
Exactly.

59:23.193 --> 59:25.725
You won´t stop until a tragedy occurs.

59:42.128 --> 59:47.007
´´An act of terrorism, ´´
according to the official version.

59:47.008 --> 59:49.385
The defense claims it was an accident.

59:49.386 --> 59:52.971
´´The engineer worked with explosives,

59:52.972 --> 59:56.767
´´and the tow truck movement
caused the explosion.´´

59:56.768 --> 59:58.268
The prosecutor responds:

59:58.269 --> 1:00:01.480
´´The fact there were no victims
proves the engineer

1:00:01.481 --> 1:00:04.233
´´meticulously calculated
the explosion range.´´

1:00:04.234 --> 1:00:06.860
This is the 4th time
my car´s been towed.

1:00:06.861 --> 1:00:08.821
Help me Dynamite!

1:00:08.822 --> 1:00:11.198
Please Dynamite:
Blow up the tax office!

1:00:11.199 --> 1:00:14.243
lnsurance company refuses to pay:

1:00:14.244 --> 1:00:18.414
´´The tow truck company´s responsible
for the damages.´´

1:00:18.415 --> 1:00:23.315
There are questions about the tow truck
company´s concession.

1:00:23.962 --> 1:00:25.671
On social networks,

1:00:25.672 --> 1:00:30.572
thousands demand the release
of the engineer known as ´´Dynamite.´´

1:00:33.096 --> 1:00:34.491
Thank you.

1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:48.197
Happy birthday, Dynamite...

1:02:14.239 --> 1:02:15.582
Dad.

1:02:22.872 --> 1:02:24.319
What happened?

1:02:26.459 --> 1:02:28.630
What happened, Santiago?

1:02:28.962 --> 1:02:30.460
Say something!

1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:01.326
Promise me he won´t go to jail.

1:03:01.327 --> 1:03:03.653
We´ll do everything we can.

1:03:05.456 --> 1:03:09.751
We reiterate: right on Libertador Avenue,

1:03:09.752 --> 1:03:13.338
a driver struck a pregnant woman
and drove off.

1:03:13.339 --> 1:03:16.425
The driver did not stop
to help the victim...

1:03:16.426 --> 1:03:19.261
Santiago, tell me the truth.

1:03:19.262 --> 1:03:20.512
Were you drinking?

1:03:20.513 --> 1:03:22.514
Did you smoke pot?

1:03:22.515 --> 1:03:25.350
The eye witnesses couldn´t identify

1:03:25.351 --> 1:03:28.504
the car brand nor the license plate.

1:03:28.646 --> 1:03:33.546
As we speak, the police is
analyzing security camera footage

1:03:33.860 --> 1:03:37.530
in order to identify the vehicle´s owner.

1:03:38.448 --> 1:03:40.741
Hit and run.

1:03:40.742 --> 1:03:45.344
Another murderer behind the wheel...

1:03:46.623 --> 1:03:48.123
Who´s the car registered to?

1:03:48.124 --> 1:03:49.791
It´s in my name.

1:03:49.792 --> 1:03:51.752
- And this is the registered address?
- Yes.

1:03:51.753 --> 1:03:53.462
What have I done?

1:03:53.463 --> 1:03:56.590
What have you done?
You ruined our life, you asshole!

1:03:56.591 --> 1:03:58.550
Help him, Mauricio, please!

1:03:58.551 --> 1:04:00.101
Get him out.

1:04:00.470 --> 1:04:04.431
Santiago, listen,
l need to ask you some questions.

1:04:04.432 --> 1:04:06.034
Look at me.

1:04:07.352 --> 1:04:10.143
Was anyone else in the car?

1:04:12.398 --> 1:04:14.566
Did you tell anyone what happened?

1:04:14.567 --> 1:04:15.745
No.

1:04:16.694 --> 1:04:18.658
Let´s take a look at the car.

1:04:20.782 --> 1:04:23.056
The windows are tinted.

1:04:25.828 --> 1:04:28.464
Were they closed?

1:04:29.123 --> 1:04:30.582
l think so.

1:04:30.583 --> 1:04:33.168
- Try to remember.
- Yes.

1:04:33.920 --> 1:04:36.296
Did you get out of the car
to see what happened

1:04:36.297 --> 1:04:37.951
or did you keep driving?

1:04:38.216 --> 1:04:39.921
l kept driving.

1:04:40.093 --> 1:04:42.212
Where were you coming from?

1:04:43.763 --> 1:04:45.261
A bar downtown.

1:04:45.598 --> 1:04:48.392
Did anyone see you arrive
or leave in the car?

1:04:48.393 --> 1:04:50.977
Your friends, a girl?

1:04:50.978 --> 1:04:53.098
I swear I can´t remember.

1:04:56.317 --> 1:04:59.820
Unfortunately,
we have just been informed

1:04:59.821 --> 1:05:03.240
that in the ambulance
heading to the hospital

1:05:03.241 --> 1:05:07.791
both the woman
and her unborn child passed away.

1:05:08.830 --> 1:05:11.415
Police is still gathering information

1:05:11.416 --> 1:05:14.569
through footage from security cameras

1:05:14.669 --> 1:05:19.166
and interrogating witnesses...

1:05:51.914 --> 1:05:55.069
- Thank you, ma´am.
- You´re welcome.

1:06:01.382 --> 1:06:06.282
l´m really embarrassed to have
to make this proposition...

1:06:07.221 --> 1:06:12.121
but we´ve known each other for years

1:06:12.435 --> 1:06:16.830
and I feel we have this kind of bond.

1:06:17.482 --> 1:06:18.670
Besides,

1:06:19.275 --> 1:06:23.904
you´re a father,
l know you want the best for your kids...

1:06:23.905 --> 1:06:26.573
So I think this arrangement

1:06:26.574 --> 1:06:30.194
may be good for you too.

1:06:32.079 --> 1:06:36.979
If you say you took the car for a drive

1:06:37.627 --> 1:06:41.504
last night while we were sleeping...

1:06:41.756 --> 1:06:46.426
and that you were driving
at the time of the accident,

1:06:46.427 --> 1:06:48.856
l´ll hire the best lawyer

1:06:49.764 --> 1:06:53.683
to get you the shortest sentence
possible...

1:06:53.684 --> 1:06:56.978
With good behavior,
you´ll be out in a year and a half.

1:06:56.979 --> 1:06:58.622
- Is that right?
- That´s right.

1:06:59.816 --> 1:07:01.107
Good.

1:07:01.442 --> 1:07:04.130
And for doing me that huge favor,

1:07:04.695 --> 1:07:06.866
l´ll pay you 500,000 dollars.

1:07:09.158 --> 1:07:13.078
You wouldn´t earn that in a lifetime.

1:07:13.079 --> 1:07:17.874
And your family will be set for life.

1:07:17.875 --> 1:07:19.839
You know Santiago...

1:07:21.629 --> 1:07:24.213
He wouldn´t survive in prison.

1:07:25.216 --> 1:07:27.335
He couldn´t stand it.

1:07:44.443 --> 1:07:45.621
José...

1:07:46.362 --> 1:07:48.533
Please, sit in the car.

1:07:51.200 --> 1:07:54.302
Grab the wheel with both hands.

1:07:54.412 --> 1:07:56.634
Touch it everywhere.

1:07:59.458 --> 1:08:00.750
Good.

1:08:00.835 --> 1:08:03.161
You´d had some whiskey.

1:08:03.212 --> 1:08:04.796
Your bosses were sleeping.

1:08:04.797 --> 1:08:07.048
As you parked the car, like every night,

1:08:07.049 --> 1:08:09.593
you felt like going for a ride.

1:08:09.594 --> 1:08:14.494
If they'd asked, you'd have said
the tires needed air.

1:08:14.599 --> 1:08:17.934
Then you bumped into something

1:08:17.935 --> 1:08:20.854
and you can´t remember anything
after that

1:08:20.855 --> 1:08:23.232
until you woke up in here.

1:08:27.236 --> 1:08:28.414
José,

1:08:28.613 --> 1:08:30.864
l can´t thank you enough.

1:08:30.865 --> 1:08:32.574
Don´t touch him, please.

1:08:32.575 --> 1:08:34.384
lt´s alright, ma´am.

1:08:41.792 --> 1:08:42.970
Excuse me.

1:08:44.837 --> 1:08:48.457
I´ve been thinking and...
l don´t know...

1:08:48.633 --> 1:08:51.165
I´d like to discuss it with my wife.

1:08:51.886 --> 1:08:55.221
She can´t know about it.
At least not now.

1:08:55.222 --> 1:08:57.186
We can´t take the risk.

1:08:57.224 --> 1:08:59.017
What if she talks?
Think about it.

1:08:59.018 --> 1:09:00.560
You end up with no deal

1:09:00.561 --> 1:09:03.480
and you´d go to prison for perjury.

1:09:03.481 --> 1:09:04.814
Fine.

1:09:04.815 --> 1:09:06.314
Honey...

1:09:08.069 --> 1:09:09.464
Well, then.

1:09:11.405 --> 1:09:15.158
You two take my van
and go to the country house.

1:09:15.159 --> 1:09:17.077
When you drive by a toll booth,
look down.

1:09:17.078 --> 1:09:20.830
Don´t stop at gas stations,
if you want to buy something,

1:09:20.831 --> 1:09:24.606
pay cash, don´t use your credit card.

1:09:25.503 --> 1:09:27.105
Come on.

1:09:31.884 --> 1:09:33.124
Let´s go!

1:09:38.224 --> 1:09:39.808
Get in the car again, please.

1:09:39.809 --> 1:09:42.031
He should sit in the back.

1:09:43.020 --> 1:09:44.260
Bring the seat forward.

1:09:50.736 --> 1:09:54.406
You two go upstairs
and go to sleep.

1:09:54.407 --> 1:09:58.180
You don´t know anything, okay?

1:10:00.287 --> 1:10:01.663
You calm down

1:10:01.664 --> 1:10:05.024
and keep quiet.
I´ll take care of this.

1:10:17.430 --> 1:10:18.825
That´s okay.

1:10:22.018 --> 1:10:24.894
- Mauricio Pereyra?
- I´m his attorney.

1:10:24.895 --> 1:10:26.563
l was about to call the police.

1:10:26.564 --> 1:10:29.614
Come in, please.
Such an awful tragedy!

1:10:29.734 --> 1:10:33.278
An hour ago,
my client heard noises downstairs.

1:10:33.279 --> 1:10:35.780
He thought someone had broken in.

1:10:35.781 --> 1:10:39.918
He went into the garage
and found the groundskeeper

1:10:40.745 --> 1:10:44.122
sitting in his car, drunk,
in a state of shock.

1:10:44.123 --> 1:10:48.415
Then he heard the news, he put two
and two together and he called me.

1:10:48.627 --> 1:10:53.178
Mauricio Pereyra,
this is the prosecutor on duty.

1:10:55.051 --> 1:10:56.801
And this is José.

1:10:56.802 --> 1:11:00.732
He´s worked for the family for what?
15 years?

1:11:02.391 --> 1:11:05.894
Now we´re going to speak
to the victim´s husband.

1:11:05.895 --> 1:11:07.520
The father of the unborn child...

1:11:07.521 --> 1:11:10.690
Sir, what do you have to say?

1:11:10.691 --> 1:11:13.151
What do I have to say?
What do you think?

1:11:13.152 --> 1:11:16.098
Turn that off, it´s not necessary.

1:11:17.031 --> 1:11:18.823
I´ve got one thing to say.

1:11:18.824 --> 1:11:21.926
Whoever did this is going to pay.

1:11:21.952 --> 1:11:23.761
Are you listening?

1:11:23.954 --> 1:11:26.998
No matter where you hide,
l´m going to...

1:11:26.999 --> 1:11:29.635
Very well. What happened, José?

1:11:29.877 --> 1:11:30.752
Excuse me.

1:11:30.753 --> 1:11:33.546
José,
you have the right to remain silent.

1:11:33.547 --> 1:11:37.300
I´ll be representing Mr. Torres
at my client´s request.

1:11:37.301 --> 1:11:42.201
He has never had any trouble
with the law and he´s the father of two.

1:11:43.099 --> 1:11:45.683
Can you tell me about the accident?

1:11:48.395 --> 1:11:51.290
l always park Mr. Mauricio´s car.

1:11:52.399 --> 1:11:55.860
l wanted to take the new one for a ride,

1:11:55.861 --> 1:11:58.704
to take the Beemer for a spin.

1:11:59.073 --> 1:12:00.726
And last night...

1:12:01.075 --> 1:12:03.039
l´d been drinking.

1:12:03.786 --> 1:12:05.905
And I went for it.

1:12:06.288 --> 1:12:09.443
I never thought something
like this could happen.

1:12:09.792 --> 1:12:13.336
I went down Libertador Avenue

1:12:13.337 --> 1:12:17.298
and I sped up.
I was driving really fast.

1:12:17.299 --> 1:12:19.968
And I bumped into something,
l couldn´t tell what it was.

1:12:19.969 --> 1:12:21.511
lt was a blur.

1:12:21.512 --> 1:12:22.679
I thought it was a dog.

1:12:22.680 --> 1:12:25.988
l heard a loud thud...

1:12:26.308 --> 1:12:27.976
And I got scared

1:12:27.977 --> 1:12:30.716
because I thought l´d dented the car.

1:12:31.147 --> 1:12:33.690
l wanted to return and try to fix it

1:12:33.691 --> 1:12:36.327
before Mr. Mauricio woke up.

1:13:03.345 --> 1:13:04.844
May I?

1:13:35.294 --> 1:13:38.602
José, can you please sit
in the driver´s seat?

1:13:48.390 --> 1:13:51.388
- Should I touch it?
- Yes, grab the wheel.

1:13:54.271 --> 1:13:56.183
Sit back.

1:14:02.238 --> 1:14:04.615
Could you shut the door?

1:14:16.627 --> 1:14:20.004
Do you use the rear view mirrors
when you drive?

1:14:20.005 --> 1:14:21.839
The mirrors?
Yes, of course I do.

1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:24.467
Because in this position,
you can only see the roof.

1:14:24.468 --> 1:14:27.673
lt´s a miracle
you only ran over one person.

1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:30.678
They must have moved
during the crash.

1:14:30.849 --> 1:14:32.865
All at the same time?

1:14:33.978 --> 1:14:35.156
Yes...

1:14:37.773 --> 1:14:42.360
I think this car was driven
by someone much taller than you.

1:14:42.361 --> 1:14:44.216
Does anyone else live in the house?

1:14:45.114 --> 1:14:47.073
My wife, my son...

1:14:47.074 --> 1:14:48.314
my dog.

1:14:49.243 --> 1:14:50.827
No need to wake up the dog,

1:14:50.828 --> 1:14:53.154
but l´d like to meet
your wife and son.

1:14:53.706 --> 1:14:57.221
Sure, no problem.
We´ll ask them to come down.

1:14:58.752 --> 1:15:02.112
Do I have your permission
to start negotiating?

1:16:18.290 --> 1:16:19.582
ls it that bad?

1:16:19.583 --> 1:16:20.761
No, everything´s fine.

1:16:22.294 --> 1:16:26.214
He´s willing to make a deal,
but it´s going to be expensive.

1:16:26.215 --> 1:16:27.507
How expensive?

1:16:27.508 --> 1:16:28.508
One million.

1:16:28.509 --> 1:16:29.634
Dollars?

1:16:29.635 --> 1:16:33.460
He saw your house, the way you live.
He won´t take less than that.

1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:35.390
The good news is
he´ll take care of everything.

1:16:35.391 --> 1:16:38.351
He knows the police chief,
most of the judges

1:16:38.352 --> 1:16:40.353
and he´ll help us reinforce the alibi.

1:16:40.354 --> 1:16:43.648
The groundskeeper´s?
Can´t we leave him out?

1:16:43.649 --> 1:16:45.775
Somebody´s got to be responsible.

1:16:45.776 --> 1:16:47.693
Two people are dead,
it was all over the news.

1:16:47.694 --> 1:16:50.196
Fine, but I don´t know
if I have that much cash.

1:16:50.197 --> 1:16:51.322
lt´s 1 .5 million dollars!

1:16:51.323 --> 1:16:53.546
And there´s my cut too.

1:16:53.784 --> 1:16:54.962
Your cut?

1:16:55.202 --> 1:16:58.162
Of course.
I´m the one negotiating all this.

1:16:58.163 --> 1:17:00.437
l pay your firm a fortune every year!

1:17:00.833 --> 1:17:05.733
This is different.
These are not fees.

1:17:06.255 --> 1:17:08.673
l´m putting my name on the line.

1:17:08.674 --> 1:17:13.136
I was about to lend you my car
so your wife and son could make a getaway.

1:17:13.137 --> 1:17:14.887
You´re not being fair.

1:17:14.888 --> 1:17:16.973
How much are we talking about?

1:17:16.974 --> 1:17:19.403
I don´t know.
Half a million?

1:17:20.894 --> 1:17:24.021
Look, if you´d like to call
another lawyer,

1:17:24.022 --> 1:17:26.710
that´s fine by me,
my work ends here.

1:17:29.236 --> 1:17:31.355
Go and close the deal.

1:17:52.009 --> 1:17:53.801
Is everything okay, José?

1:17:53.802 --> 1:17:55.559
Well, not really.

1:17:55.721 --> 1:17:56.762
Why not?

1:17:56.763 --> 1:18:00.641
For going to prison,
I´m getting the same as your lawyer?

1:18:00.642 --> 1:18:02.518
l know I´m poor, but...

1:18:02.519 --> 1:18:05.259
- What you´re doing is awful.
- Awful?

1:18:05.814 --> 1:18:07.985
Then you go to prison.

1:18:08.150 --> 1:18:10.818
Last night I watched a Western,
had a cup of tea

1:18:10.819 --> 1:18:12.938
and went to bed early.

1:18:13.447 --> 1:18:17.582
What else do you want, José?
Be clear, time is running out.

1:18:18.035 --> 1:18:20.050
The money we agreed on...

1:18:20.621 --> 1:18:22.274
and an apartment in Mar de Ajó.

1:18:24.041 --> 1:18:25.281
Mauricio, José.

1:18:25.501 --> 1:18:27.982
Can we all talk?

1:18:31.173 --> 1:18:34.016
Justice, justice!

1:18:37.137 --> 1:18:39.931
Let´s get to the point, gentlemen,
time is of the essence,

1:18:39.932 --> 1:18:41.974
there´s no room
for misunderstandings.

1:18:41.975 --> 1:18:44.818
The story stays the same.

1:18:45.145 --> 1:18:48.356
l´m going to need you
and your family to testify,

1:18:48.357 --> 1:18:49.857
so no one leaves town.

1:18:49.858 --> 1:18:52.960
You´ll leave the house in cuffs,
with a hood on.

1:18:53.070 --> 1:18:55.696
Outside there´ll be press
and angry people,

1:18:55.697 --> 1:18:59.033
they'll ask you questions,
call you names, don't say a word.

1:18:59.034 --> 1:19:02.537
We avoid controversy,
let the trial move along,

1:19:02.538 --> 1:19:05.484
get a conviction and everyone´s happy.

1:19:05.582 --> 1:19:08.115
Stop, mom! It´s my life!

1:19:08.877 --> 1:19:11.212
He wants to go out there and confess...

1:19:11.213 --> 1:19:12.588
lt´s the right thing to do!

1:19:12.589 --> 1:19:14.966
Say something,
he has no idea what he's doing!

1:19:14.967 --> 1:19:16.884
Santiago, calm down...

1:19:16.885 --> 1:19:18.219
Your mom is right,

1:19:18.220 --> 1:19:19.971
we´ll fix this.

1:19:19.972 --> 1:19:23.599
Can you shut the door
and take care of Santiago, please?

1:19:23.600 --> 1:19:24.850
Let´s go!

1:19:24.851 --> 1:19:26.609
Calm down, Santi.

1:19:29.523 --> 1:19:30.711
Can we proceed?

1:19:32.401 --> 1:19:35.111
From now on, you´ll be the middle man.

1:19:35.112 --> 1:19:38.364
l won´t talk to Mr. Pereyra again
until he testifies in court.

1:19:38.365 --> 1:19:42.243
And you, José, avoid talking
to anyone except your lawyer.

1:19:42.244 --> 1:19:43.411
Perfect.

1:19:43.412 --> 1:19:46.080
l´ll need some cash
for operational expenses,

1:19:46.081 --> 1:19:47.623
let´s say 30,000 dollars.

1:19:47.624 --> 1:19:49.542
l´ll need it first thing on Monday.

1:19:49.543 --> 1:19:51.610
Just one question.

1:19:52.713 --> 1:19:55.590
What do you mean
by operational expenses?

1:19:55.591 --> 1:19:58.050
There are officers outside,
the police chief is there.

1:19:58.051 --> 1:20:02.221
If someone saw or heard anything,
we need to cut them in.

1:20:02.222 --> 1:20:05.182
We have to avoid loose ends.

1:20:05.183 --> 1:20:06.517
So if you're OK...

1:20:06.518 --> 1:20:09.020
You´ll have the money on Monday,

1:20:09.021 --> 1:20:11.814
but it´s coming out
of the budget we agreed on,

1:20:11.815 --> 1:20:13.399
I won´t pay one more penny.

1:20:13.400 --> 1:20:16.360
- Mauricio, please.
- Yes, please...

1:20:16.361 --> 1:20:19.153
That´s what I say. Please!

1:20:19.323 --> 1:20:21.442
I know l´m in a rough spot,

1:20:21.700 --> 1:20:24.076
but I won´t be gutted like this.

1:20:24.077 --> 1:20:27.830
What the prosecutor
is saying is reasonable.

1:20:27.831 --> 1:20:31.042
Let´s not argue over 30,000 dollars.

1:20:31.043 --> 1:20:34.506
You pay it then.
Take it out of your share.

1:20:37.090 --> 1:20:39.216
Gentlemen, there´s no time for arguing.

1:20:39.217 --> 1:20:41.218
If you want to proceed
we have to do it now.

1:20:41.219 --> 1:20:42.386
Then you pay it.

1:20:42.387 --> 1:20:44.144
You´re getting 1 million dollars

1:20:44.389 --> 1:20:47.129
and you want an extra
30,000 for contingencies?

1:20:47.309 --> 1:20:48.911
Who´s getting a million?

1:20:54.775 --> 1:20:56.221
He´s right.

1:20:56.693 --> 1:21:00.029
The million includes contingencies.

1:21:00.030 --> 1:21:03.658
Your cut plus the 30,000 add up
to a million dollars.

1:21:03.659 --> 1:21:05.778
Don´t touch my cut.

1:21:07.913 --> 1:21:10.084
You know what, guys?

1:21:10.457 --> 1:21:12.783
lt´s over. The deal is off.

1:21:14.086 --> 1:21:15.544
What do you mean it´s off?

1:21:15.545 --> 1:21:17.096
lt´s off!

1:21:17.798 --> 1:21:20.072
It´s over! No one gets anything!

1:21:20.092 --> 1:21:21.745
No more!

1:21:21.802 --> 1:21:23.248
Santiago!

1:21:24.346 --> 1:21:26.672
You said you wanted to confess?

1:21:26.765 --> 1:21:29.392
That´s perfect.
Go out there and talk.

1:21:29.393 --> 1:21:31.310
l gave you the best education

1:21:31.311 --> 1:21:33.688
and you always did
whatever you wanted.

1:21:33.689 --> 1:21:36.170
So now, go screw yourself!

1:21:39.945 --> 1:21:41.028
Calm down.

1:21:41.029 --> 1:21:42.905
Can we be reasonable?

1:21:42.906 --> 1:21:44.870
What happened?

1:21:45.117 --> 1:21:47.952
They´re all vultures!
That´s what happened!

1:21:47.953 --> 1:21:50.382
But it´s over.
l didn´t kill anyone!

1:21:53.250 --> 1:21:55.876
...the house of the alleged murderer
right here in San lsidro.

1:21:55.877 --> 1:21:58.979
This morning there was
an accident on Libertador Avenue...

1:22:27.033 --> 1:22:30.912
Open the door.
I have something important to tell you.

1:22:32.664 --> 1:22:35.958
Can we talk in a civilized manner?

1:22:35.959 --> 1:22:37.084
What?

1:22:37.085 --> 1:22:38.669
It´s settled, we have an agreement.

1:22:38.670 --> 1:22:40.963
The 30,000 dollars will come
out of everyone´s share.

1:22:40.964 --> 1:22:43.132
l don´t want to hear about it!
lt´s over!

1:22:43.133 --> 1:22:45.009
Get out of my house!

1:22:45.010 --> 1:22:47.428
Let me remind you
two people are dead.

1:22:47.429 --> 1:22:49.388
lf Santiago is found guilty,

1:22:49.389 --> 1:22:51.849
it will cost us much more.

1:22:51.850 --> 1:22:54.226
José, on the other hand, is penniless.

1:22:54.227 --> 1:22:57.396
Right, so who will compensate
the victim´s family?

1:22:57.397 --> 1:23:00.316
The money should go to them,
that´s the right thing to do.

1:23:00.317 --> 1:23:03.027
That scumbag earns a salary
that comes out of my taxes?

1:23:03.028 --> 1:23:04.653
He should investigate what happened!

1:23:04.654 --> 1:23:07.198
You want to represent my son?
Discuss your fees with him!

1:23:07.199 --> 1:23:09.325
lf he can pay,
it´s between you two.

1:23:09.326 --> 1:23:10.951
Do what you have to do!

1:23:10.952 --> 1:23:12.503
Do your job!

1:23:12.662 --> 1:23:14.455
We had a deal,

1:23:14.456 --> 1:23:16.937
it´s not honorable to back out.

1:23:17.918 --> 1:23:19.835
I´m sorry if I offended you,

1:23:19.836 --> 1:23:23.923
but I´ve always defended
your family´s interests.

1:23:23.924 --> 1:23:27.646
I thank you with all my heart!
You´re an angel!

1:23:36.937 --> 1:23:38.771
Can I talk to them

1:23:38.772 --> 1:23:42.235
to see if I can improve the terms?

1:23:44.569 --> 1:23:46.223
Excuse me.

1:23:48.990 --> 1:23:50.282
Listen,

1:23:50.283 --> 1:23:53.410
I think we have
a better deal to offer you.

1:23:53.411 --> 1:23:56.330
José takes the initial 500,000

1:23:56.331 --> 1:23:59.542
and says forget about
the apartment on the beach.

1:23:59.543 --> 1:24:01.961
The prosecutor and I
split the million.

1:24:01.962 --> 1:24:03.420
Not one penny more.

1:24:03.421 --> 1:24:05.005
But we have to do it now,
Mauricio.

1:24:05.006 --> 1:24:08.551
The press is outside
and the prosecutor needs

1:24:08.552 --> 1:24:11.963
to let the police chief
into the house.

1:24:12.722 --> 1:24:14.066
No!

1:24:14.683 --> 1:24:17.309
l´ll put up a total of one million

1:24:17.310 --> 1:24:19.311
and you split it any way you want.

1:24:19.312 --> 1:24:22.398
- What do you mean, one million?
- Take it or leave it!

1:24:22.399 --> 1:24:24.673
If you don´t like it, get lost!

1:24:24.734 --> 1:24:26.861
You come back here with
any other proposal

1:24:26.862 --> 1:24:28.825
and l´ll press charges against
you for extortion.

1:24:28.905 --> 1:24:31.490
Against you and the prosecutor!

1:24:35.370 --> 1:24:37.580
Prosecutor, can you reveal
the identity of the suspect?

1:24:37.581 --> 1:24:39.123
l can´t give any details right now,

1:24:39.124 --> 1:24:42.042
but the case is virtually closed.

1:24:42.043 --> 1:24:43.252
There´s only one suspect

1:24:43.253 --> 1:24:45.629
and l´m about to present
the brief to the judge.

1:24:45.630 --> 1:24:46.819
Thank you.

1:24:48.133 --> 1:24:50.148
Justice, justice!

1:24:54.264 --> 1:24:55.442
Watch out!

1:25:31.343 --> 1:25:33.100
Always showing some skin, Bocha!

1:25:43.897 --> 1:25:45.240
And now...

1:25:46.107 --> 1:25:49.401
it´s time we all stand up

1:25:49.402 --> 1:25:51.935
and give a big hand

1:25:52.322 --> 1:25:54.493
to welcome our dear...

1:25:54.866 --> 1:25:57.244
Romina and Ariel!

1:26:34.948 --> 1:26:37.377
Let me hug my father-in-law!

1:26:39.911 --> 1:26:41.578
Take good care of her.

1:26:41.579 --> 1:26:45.199
I´ll be watching.

1:26:48.420 --> 1:26:49.918
Thank you!

1:26:51.673 --> 1:26:53.947
l gave him a few good tips...

1:28:08.625 --> 1:28:10.847
Long live the newly weds!

1:28:22.013 --> 1:28:24.287
Everyone look this way.

1:28:30.146 --> 1:28:31.593
A big smile!

1:28:32.857 --> 1:28:35.338
Thank you very much.

1:28:35.860 --> 1:28:37.038
Thanks!

1:28:37.070 --> 1:28:38.310
Thank you.

1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:40.779
Enjoy.

1:28:41.950 --> 1:28:43.293
Romina.

1:28:45.829 --> 1:28:48.872
This is a little something for you.

1:28:48.873 --> 1:28:52.459
You shouldn´t have.

1:28:52.460 --> 1:28:54.683
You being here is gift enough.

1:28:54.963 --> 1:28:56.171
Are you having a good time?

1:28:56.172 --> 1:28:59.377
Lovely.
You´re so beautiful!

1:28:59.592 --> 1:29:01.927
Your family is so nice.

1:29:01.928 --> 1:29:05.180
Too bad this country is so unsafe.

1:29:05.181 --> 1:29:08.767
Roni´s wallet was stolen last night
and he didn´t even realize it.

1:29:08.768 --> 1:29:10.477
That´s horrible!

1:29:10.478 --> 1:29:11.812
How awful!

1:29:11.813 --> 1:29:13.939
Yes, things are bad now,

1:29:13.940 --> 1:29:15.335
but little by little...

1:29:16.359 --> 1:29:18.995
So many beautiful people.
All friends of yours?

1:29:20.530 --> 1:29:24.199
Well, those are our friends
from the country club.

1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:25.951
We hadn´t seen each other
since we were 13,

1:29:25.952 --> 1:29:28.620
but with Facebook and all,
we got back in touch.

1:29:28.621 --> 1:29:30.016
Facebook!

1:29:30.915 --> 1:29:33.333
Those back there
are my college friends

1:29:33.334 --> 1:29:35.127
with their boyfriends.

1:29:35.128 --> 1:29:37.867
Well, the ones who have boyfriends.

1:29:37.964 --> 1:29:39.464
Those are...

1:29:39.465 --> 1:29:42.360
Ariel´s co-workers...

1:29:44.512 --> 1:29:46.513
Are you having a good time?

1:29:46.514 --> 1:29:49.600
- Yes. Are you?
- Good...

1:29:49.601 --> 1:29:52.857
Your typical wedding.

1:29:53.479 --> 1:29:55.340
You´re something, you know?

1:29:58.276 --> 1:29:59.610
Enjoy.

1:29:59.611 --> 1:30:01.057
You too.

1:30:04.616 --> 1:30:06.783
Do you know any good place

1:30:06.784 --> 1:30:09.161
for us to learn the tango?

1:30:09.162 --> 1:30:12.873
Yes! No... Not me.
But I know my cousin would.

1:30:12.874 --> 1:30:14.838
I´ll introduce you.

1:31:16.771 --> 1:31:18.528
Fuck! I don´t...

1:31:18.648 --> 1:31:19.991
What is it?

1:31:20.984 --> 1:31:22.985
No more wine for you.

1:31:22.986 --> 1:31:27.018
No, don´t do that.
Act like you´re talking to me.

1:32:18.666 --> 1:32:22.085
Ariel, who´s that girl
with the long hair?

1:32:22.086 --> 1:32:23.128
Which one?

1:32:23.129 --> 1:32:26.644
That one over there.
Your co-worker.

1:32:29.886 --> 1:32:31.333
Lourdes.

1:32:32.138 --> 1:32:33.430
Why?

1:32:34.307 --> 1:32:35.754
No reason.

1:32:38.061 --> 1:32:41.265
And how does Lourdes know
your guitar teacher?

1:32:42.315 --> 1:32:44.279
My guitar teacher?

1:32:45.902 --> 1:32:48.111
A few months ago
someone called your phone

1:32:48.112 --> 1:32:52.491
when I answered, they hung up.
You said it was your guitar teacher.

1:32:52.492 --> 1:32:54.611
lt seemed weird, so I saved the number.

1:32:54.660 --> 1:32:58.590
And now I call and Lourdes picks up.

1:32:59.791 --> 1:33:01.792
I don´t know what you´re talking about.

1:33:01.793 --> 1:33:03.343
You don´t know?

1:33:03.878 --> 1:33:08.715
With all the cell phone companies
and special deals out there,

1:33:08.716 --> 1:33:13.053
this girl just happened to buy
your guitar teacher´s phone line?

1:33:13.054 --> 1:33:15.347
Especially if you never
introduced them.

1:33:15.348 --> 1:33:17.725
lsn´t it an amazing coincidence?

1:33:19.602 --> 1:33:21.411
- So?
- What?

1:33:21.604 --> 1:33:24.189
Answer me or I´ll ask her myself.

1:33:24.190 --> 1:33:26.108
- Romi, please, don´t.
- Don´t ´´Romi´´ me!

1:33:26.109 --> 1:33:28.434
Answer my question!

1:33:29.362 --> 1:33:34.262
Ariel, does everyone at table 27
know that you fucked that girl?

1:33:34.659 --> 1:33:39.246
Did you invite all those jerks
to our wedding? How could you?

1:33:39.247 --> 1:33:41.081
l´m sorry to interrupt.

1:33:41.082 --> 1:33:43.792
May I have this dance
with the prince?

1:33:43.793 --> 1:33:46.067
Of course, my queen.

1:33:46.129 --> 1:33:48.041
Here´s your prince.

1:33:52.802 --> 1:33:54.094
What happened?

1:33:54.220 --> 1:33:55.408
Nothing.

1:34:04.856 --> 1:34:06.509
Romi, are you okay?

1:34:09.735 --> 1:34:11.027
What is it?

1:34:12.113 --> 1:34:13.456
Just a moment.

1:34:18.327 --> 1:34:21.739
Bocha, can I have a minute?

1:34:31.924 --> 1:34:33.319
Honey.

1:34:34.802 --> 1:34:37.593
Baby, stop it.
Let´s enjoy our wedding.

1:34:40.266 --> 1:34:42.178
Did you sleep with that girl?

1:34:45.771 --> 1:34:48.201
Please, tell me the truth,

1:34:48.232 --> 1:34:50.041
l need to know.

1:34:55.615 --> 1:34:57.010
Yes, baby.

1:34:59.368 --> 1:35:03.247
But it didn´t mean anything to me,
I swear.

1:35:03.456 --> 1:35:06.124
Romi, please,
let´s not make a scene here.

1:35:06.125 --> 1:35:07.876
- It was a mistake.
- Let me go!

1:35:07.877 --> 1:35:09.503
l´m sorry! Really, I made a mistake.

1:35:09.504 --> 1:35:11.054
I want to be alone!

1:36:00.846 --> 1:36:01.846
What was that?

1:36:01.847 --> 1:36:04.949
- Did you see her?
- You´re asking me?

1:36:22.827 --> 1:36:24.274
Everything okay?

1:36:28.916 --> 1:36:31.294
Shall I get somebody?

1:36:35.423 --> 1:36:36.663
Are you all right?

1:36:39.927 --> 1:36:41.529
Clearly you´re not all right.

1:36:43.431 --> 1:36:45.550
Calm down.
What happened?

1:36:46.142 --> 1:36:49.394
l just found out my husband
cheated on me

1:36:49.395 --> 1:36:51.354
with one of our wedding guests.

1:36:51.355 --> 1:36:52.906
That´s awful.

1:36:53.733 --> 1:36:56.776
And now I don´t know what to do

1:36:56.777 --> 1:37:00.030
with all those people down there.

1:37:00.031 --> 1:37:02.657
Calm down, these things happen...

1:37:02.658 --> 1:37:04.105
Time heals all wounds.

1:37:04.201 --> 1:37:05.648
Here.

1:37:09.248 --> 1:37:12.292
lf you love him,
you´ll be able to forgive him.

1:37:12.293 --> 1:37:15.446
- If he´s the one for you...
- I don´t know if I love him!

1:37:18.049 --> 1:37:20.840
l don´t know if he´s the one for me...

1:37:21.218 --> 1:37:23.094
He´s an asshole!

1:37:23.095 --> 1:37:24.596
Well, then...

1:37:24.597 --> 1:37:27.015
To hell with him.

1:37:27.016 --> 1:37:28.808
And don´t worry about the guests,

1:37:28.809 --> 1:37:31.603
you´re not the first woman
at that party to be cheated on.

1:37:31.604 --> 1:37:32.479
Plus,

1:37:32.480 --> 1:37:35.649
if you spend your time worrying
about what other people think

1:37:35.650 --> 1:37:37.613
you´re screwed, kiddo.

1:37:40.488 --> 1:37:41.883
All better?

1:37:43.824 --> 1:37:45.064
Look...

1:37:45.868 --> 1:37:47.832
lf I were you,
I´d go downstairs,

1:37:48.454 --> 1:37:51.206
move the party along, end it early,

1:37:51.207 --> 1:37:55.126
and then, back at home,
tell him it´s over.

1:37:55.127 --> 1:37:59.316
What happened to you is awful,
I won´t deny it.

1:37:59.757 --> 1:38:01.359
But you have to move on.

1:38:05.054 --> 1:38:06.449
Better?

1:39:21.756 --> 1:39:22.934
Romina?

1:39:24.759 --> 1:39:28.428
Get the hell out of here!
Don´t say a word!

1:39:28.429 --> 1:39:31.514
You don´t know
who you´re messing with!

1:39:31.515 --> 1:39:33.767
l´ll take every penny you have,

1:39:33.768 --> 1:39:36.853
every property your dad put
in your name

1:39:36.854 --> 1:39:38.354
to get around taxes

1:39:38.355 --> 1:39:39.564
will be mine.

1:39:39.565 --> 1:39:40.908
We are married.

1:39:41.108 --> 1:39:43.318
Legally married.

1:39:43.319 --> 1:39:47.947
I´ll spend all my days
sleeping with any man who looks my way

1:39:47.948 --> 1:39:50.575
anyone who gives me
an ounce of love.

1:39:50.576 --> 1:39:52.994
And when it´s you
who wants the divorce,

1:39:52.995 --> 1:39:54.704
l´ll take acting lessons

1:39:54.705 --> 1:39:57.457
so I can stand before the judge
like a sad little puppy

1:39:57.458 --> 1:40:00.001
and tell him l´m fighting
to make this work,

1:40:00.002 --> 1:40:03.129
that way our marriage
will last forever.

1:40:03.130 --> 1:40:06.090
l´ll post all your secrets on Facebook!

1:40:06.091 --> 1:40:10.136
I´ll torture you
until you scream with pain.

1:40:10.137 --> 1:40:13.932
You´ll be so humiliated
that your only way out

1:40:13.933 --> 1:40:16.851
will be jumping off a bridge.

1:40:16.852 --> 1:40:17.894
And then,

1:40:17.895 --> 1:40:20.188
when death do us part,

1:40:20.189 --> 1:40:24.739
when your death do us part,
I´ll have it all.

1:40:29.532 --> 1:40:31.407
Ariel, calm down.

1:40:31.408 --> 1:40:32.855
Come on, buddy.

1:40:54.348 --> 1:40:56.674
Where the hell have you been?

1:41:06.443 --> 1:41:07.621
Stop!

1:41:13.909 --> 1:41:15.118
Put me down!

1:41:15.119 --> 1:41:17.996
Put me down, assholes!

1:41:17.997 --> 1:41:20.995
Gustavo, tell them to let me down!

1:41:23.168 --> 1:41:24.419
Something is wrong!

1:41:24.420 --> 1:41:25.879
Can´t you get them to
put me down!

1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:26.796
l´m telling them!

1:41:26.797 --> 1:41:28.965
Marianito! Turco!

1:41:28.966 --> 1:41:30.091
Careful, boys.

1:41:30.092 --> 1:41:33.142
Goddamn it, Comanche!

1:41:36.599 --> 1:41:37.994
Stop it!

1:41:38.475 --> 1:41:42.612
Assholes!

1:42:43.749 --> 1:42:46.230
Leaving already?

1:42:46.251 --> 1:42:48.422
No, no, stay.

1:42:49.630 --> 1:42:53.093
We worked it out.
Really, don´t worry, come with me.

1:43:04.019 --> 1:43:05.979
Stop, I´m getting dizzy!

1:43:05.980 --> 1:43:08.719
Relax, this is great!

1:43:09.108 --> 1:43:10.692
Stop it, please!

1:43:10.693 --> 1:43:14.320
Did you ever go to that amusement park?

1:43:14.321 --> 1:43:18.096
The one they closed down
because the rollercoaster flew off the...

1:43:25.666 --> 1:43:26.958
Call a doctor!

1:43:26.959 --> 1:43:29.502
...and she threatened to take
every last dime,

1:43:29.503 --> 1:43:31.713
even all his properties...

1:43:31.714 --> 1:43:34.465
- We´re taking her home...
- Yes, that´d be the best.

1:43:34.466 --> 1:43:39.366
I´m very sorry about this.
It was still a wonderful party.

1:43:40.222 --> 1:43:41.556
Excuse me, please.

1:43:41.557 --> 1:43:45.309
Most of the cuts are superficial,
they´ll heal quickly.

1:43:45.310 --> 1:43:47.770
But we´ll take her in just to make sure

1:43:47.771 --> 1:43:49.397
that no tendons are torn.

1:43:49.398 --> 1:43:52.189
Does she have good medical insurance?

1:43:52.568 --> 1:43:56.237
Romina, please, go back inside.

1:43:56.238 --> 1:43:58.990
l´m just asking about her insurance.

1:43:58.991 --> 1:44:00.696
Great. Stay there.

1:44:05.873 --> 1:44:07.164
l´m fine.

1:44:09.835 --> 1:44:11.954
Romi, dear, are you okay?

1:44:12.337 --> 1:44:15.594
- Are you sure?
- Yes, don´t worry. Relax.

1:44:17.801 --> 1:44:21.473
Why don´t we use this break
to cut the cake?

1:44:32.524 --> 1:44:35.777
Come on, girls,
don´t leave me hanging here.

1:44:35.778 --> 1:44:37.845
Come on, girls.

1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:44.160
It´s been a terrible night,
but now I want to relax

1:44:44.161 --> 1:44:45.659
and enjoy my wedding.

1:44:48.040 --> 1:44:50.676
l don´t think l´ll get married again.

1:44:52.252 --> 1:44:53.430
Now!

1:44:54.797 --> 1:44:56.088
Romi!

1:44:57.716 --> 1:44:59.842
Mili, you got it!

1:44:59.843 --> 1:45:01.755
l can´t believe it!

1:45:02.387 --> 1:45:04.713
A picture with Mili!

1:45:11.688 --> 1:45:13.807
Wouldn´t you like to marry Mili?

1:45:14.525 --> 1:45:16.234
Come on!

1:45:16.235 --> 1:45:19.320
All the rest may be bullshit,

1:45:19.321 --> 1:45:21.364
but let´s prove the ring tradition
comes true!

1:45:21.365 --> 1:45:22.615
Wouldn´t that be great?

1:45:22.616 --> 1:45:24.580
Stop, Romi.

1:45:24.660 --> 1:45:26.624
Kiss...

1:45:33.877 --> 1:45:37.964
We should do the garters,
toss the bouquet...

1:45:37.965 --> 1:45:40.133
Do you want to continue
or call this off?

1:45:40.134 --> 1:45:43.386
We´re calling it off.

1:45:43.387 --> 1:45:46.222
But why? You´re such a party pooper!

1:45:46.223 --> 1:45:48.445
Girls, here it goes!

1:45:50.060 --> 1:45:52.937
Besides, we still haven´t had
the hot pastrami.

1:45:52.938 --> 1:45:55.148
Boy, that was expensive!

1:45:55.149 --> 1:45:56.482
Ariel, tell them.

1:45:56.483 --> 1:46:00.862
We spent a whole week arguing
about the pastrami.

1:46:00.863 --> 1:46:04.073
We decided on it, we paid for it,
and now I want some.

1:46:04.074 --> 1:46:05.986
Romina! Stop it!

1:46:06.577 --> 1:46:08.230
Let everyone go home.

1:46:08.537 --> 1:46:10.553
This isn´t a joke.

1:46:10.664 --> 1:46:15.564
My family´s lawyer even suggested
I press charges against you.

1:46:22.968 --> 1:46:26.470
Don´t tell me this is all mommy´s idea.

1:46:26.471 --> 1:46:29.314
Cut it out, Romina!

1:46:29.391 --> 1:46:31.559
Your mom is a real...

1:46:31.560 --> 1:46:33.019
wedding planner.

1:46:33.020 --> 1:46:34.518
Stop it!

1:46:36.773 --> 1:46:38.789
What did I do to you?

1:46:38.817 --> 1:46:42.902
lt was nothing compared to
what you´re doing to me!

1:46:50.537 --> 1:46:51.777
Son,

1:46:52.289 --> 1:46:55.082

1:46:55.083 --> 1:46:56.530
Please.

1:47:00.422 --> 1:47:01.869
God...

1:47:06.595 --> 1:47:08.404

1:47:10.098 --> 1:47:13.200

1:47:16.980 --> 1:47:19.151

1:47:21.193 --> 1:47:23.622

1:47:37.376 --> 1:47:42.276

1:47:43.507 --> 1:47:44.882

1:47:44.883 --> 1:47:49.220

1:47:54.559 --> 1:47:57.559
Get off my daughter, bitch.

1:47:58.272 --> 1:47:59.730
Stay out or it´s hell!

1:47:59.731 --> 1:48:01.644
I was going to help you, Bocha.

1:48:01.858 --> 1:48:03.357
Cuca, come here.

1:48:08.573 --> 1:48:10.744
Honey, are you all right?

1:48:45.235 --> 1:48:46.475
Doctor!

1:48:48.989 --> 1:48:52.074
You take care of her,
you take him.

1:48:52.075 --> 1:48:53.534
What is he on?

1:48:53.535 --> 1:48:56.454
Nothing, he had an emotional shock.
No drugs here...

1:48:56.455 --> 1:48:57.747
Can you walk?

1:48:57.748 --> 1:48:59.608
What´s the name of the bride?

1:49:00.542 --> 1:49:01.730
Romina...

1:49:02.377 --> 1:49:06.876
l need you to sit down so
l can take your blood pressure.

1:49:08.050 --> 1:49:10.013
A chair, Mauro!

1:49:10.093 --> 1:49:11.177
Sit down.

1:49:11.178 --> 1:49:13.400
Take his jacket off, please.

1:49:14.848 --> 1:49:17.019
Can you sit down?

1:49:21.563 --> 1:49:22.980
Are you okay?

1:49:22.981 --> 1:49:24.997
Relax, Romi, relax.

1:49:30.822 --> 1:49:33.252
Can you get her some water?

1:49:38.580 --> 1:49:39.705
Easy, Romi.

1:49:39.706 --> 1:49:40.946
You just need to rest.

1:49:59.851 --> 1:50:01.712
Wait, Ariel.

1:50:05.565 --> 1:50:07.271
Calm down.

1:50:08.151 --> 1:50:09.598
It´s fine.

1:50:21.289 --> 1:50:23.958
Nothing happened.
We are all right. Okay?

1:50:23.959 --> 1:50:25.354

To my father
