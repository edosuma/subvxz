WEBVTT

02:25.612 --> 02:27.989
Don't get me wrong.

02:28.072 --> 02:31.284
I love the 49ers!
Montana and Rice?

02:31.409 --> 02:33.453
They're Hall of Famelocks, baby.

02:33.578 --> 02:37.582
But do they cover the spread?
Hell no.

02:37.707 --> 02:40.168
Not like the Giants.
Let me tell you something.

02:40.293 --> 02:44.797
You can give me Simms and Bavaro,
Meggett and L.T. any day.

02:44.923 --> 02:47.425
Those guys are your meat and potatoes.
They fucking cover, baby.

02:47.550 --> 02:51.971
And don't even bring up Miami. Don't.
Cause there's nothing in Miami.

02:52.055 --> 02:55.642
Miami has nothing but Marino with a
golden arm and some fat-booty cheerleaders.

02:55.808 --> 03:00.688
They have no running game. It’s like two
virgins who can't find the dam hole.

03:00.772 --> 03:04.651
That's why they get blitzed
all the damn time. You understand?

03:04.734 --> 03:07.987
I can't believe you guys, man.

03:08.112 --> 03:12.659
Yeah, they put up a ton of points,
but they cover every other week.

03:12.742 --> 03:16.329
So take the over and bet the fucking farm.
You understand?

03:16.412 --> 03:18.998
The pigs, the barn, the little chickens
and that tractor.

03:19.123 --> 03:21.668
Bet all of that.

03:21.751 --> 03:25.505
- Dallas, America’s team, my sweet black ass.
- Come on.

03:25.588 --> 03:28.800
Try to book--

03:28.925 --> 03:32.387
Everybody and their grandmother
wanna bet the Cowboys.

03:32.470 --> 03:35.390
Therefore they gotta win
by two touchdowns just to cover.

03:35.515 --> 03:38.685
And what are the odds on that happening?
So dome a favor.

03:38.810 --> 03:41.020
Take the points and run.

03:41.145 --> 03:43.189
Come on, guys.

03:43.273 --> 03:47.193
Allright?
Unless you are a moron, retarded Saints fan.

03:47.277 --> 03:50.321
Therefore you deserve
to get cornholed on the 50-yard-line.

03:50.405 --> 03:53.992
- America's sport, baby-- football.
- I hate football.

03:54.075 --> 03:58.162
Talk about my sport.
I can do any bet.

03:58.288 --> 04:01.332
- One minute, fellas.

04:01.499 --> 04:03.459
It's show time.

04:09.716 --> 04:12.135
Okay, let's do it.

04:18.683 --> 04:21.186
That's a nasty habit, man.

04:31.696 --> 04:33.740
Go!

04:53.134 --> 04:56.262
-Everybody, down on the ground!
-Down, get down on the foor!

04:56.387 --> 05:00.099
- Everybody!
- Get down! Get down! Move! Let's go!

05:00.225 --> 05:03.228
- Move!
- Come on!

05:03.311 --> 05:05.939
What are you looking at?
Get down there!

05:06.064 --> 05:09.567
- How long?
- Two minutes.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.617
I see you, granny!
Get your ass out here. Come on.

05:19.077 --> 05:21.412
Bingo.

05:29.671 --> 05:32.799
No cameras.

05:32.924 --> 05:35.385
- 1798.
- That's a bad year.

05:36.845 --> 05:39.097
It's 90 seconds!

05:43.935 --> 05:45.520
Got it.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.404
Upstairs.

06:01.119 --> 06:04.205
- What is that?
- Nothing. Just estate junk.

06:05.373 --> 06:08.001
One  minute!

06:09.961 --> 06:12.130
- It's not here.
- It's there.

06:12.255 --> 06:14.174
- It's not here!
- It's there!

06:25.143 --> 06:26.311
Forty-five!

06:26.436 --> 06:28.396
My God.

06:35.069 --> 06:36.905
Thirty seconds!

06:40.950 --> 06:42.869
Okay, come on.

07:26.496 --> 07:30.875
Break out the diamond. Let’s see that
ten million dollar red beauty, baby!

07:33.044 --> 07:35.004
Fucking right.

07:43.555 --> 07:47.058
The surgeon general was right!
Cigarettes can kill!

07:48.810 --> 07:51.437
- Go back.
- Is there a problem?

07:51.563 --> 07:54.691
- Fucking go back!

08:50.747 --> 08:54.209
"The psychodynamics of compulsive
stealing are well established.

08:54.292 --> 08:59.005
"An act committed to relieve
a pre-existing state of guilt.

08:59.130 --> 09:03.551
"An attempt to harm an imagined enemy
or a form of revenge...

09:03.676 --> 09:06.888
"against those who have deprived the
person of something significant...

09:07.013 --> 09:12.227
or somehow inficted
a narcissistic injury."

09:15.980 --> 09:19.484
But stealing panties
from the girls' locker room,

09:19.609 --> 09:23.530
there’s nothing in there.

09:25.907 --> 09:28.993
I've never really been
a big fan of Freud's anyway.

09:29.118 --> 09:33.039
I don't know if I should say this,
I'm a professional.

09:33.122 --> 09:35.875
I won't say anything.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.420
You promise
to keep your word?

09:40.547 --> 09:42.257
Okay.

09:42.382 --> 09:45.844
You know that thing that
you were doing with the panties?

09:45.969 --> 09:49.556
Everybody does it.

09:49.681 --> 09:55.019
Your best friends do it. The mailman,
the headmaster. They all whack off.

09:55.103 --> 09:59.399
And if anybody tells you
they don't, they're lying.

09:59.524 --> 10:01.901
My momsays I'm--

10:02.026 --> 10:04.737
She says I'm oversexed.

10:06.281 --> 10:09.576
- Now you're dead!

10:24.883 --> 10:27.760
- Hello? Hi, Daddy.
- Hello.

10:27.886 --> 10:31.598
- Excuse me. Who am I speaking to?
- This is me.

10:31.723 --> 10:36.060
No, my Jessie is eight. The girl
I'm talking to is at least 11 .

10:36.144 --> 10:39.063
Can I speak to your mother,
please?

10:39.147 --> 10:40.940
Mom.

10:41.107 --> 10:43.484
- Don't forget the turkey.
- Why don’t you have them deliver it?

10:43.610 --> 10:47.322
It's Thanks giving Eve, Nathan.
You might as well get the bird to fly here.

10:47.488 --> 10:50.909
All right, okay. Fairway, right?
What's the cross street, 74th?

10:51.034 --> 10:53.953
- The man's a steel trap.

10:54.037 --> 10:57.248
- I will be there in ten minutes.
- Bye.

11:05.757 --> 11:07.967
Go away.

11:12.263 --> 11:15.767
- Come on.

11:17.936 --> 11:19.395
Shit!

12:05.817 --> 12:07.986
Louis?

12:08.069 --> 12:11.197
This better be
a real emergency.

12:11.322 --> 12:14.158
Ah, my hero! Look.

12:14.242 --> 12:18.538
She's not one of your Dalton trust
fund waifs, but she needs your help.

12:18.621 --> 12:20.665
I don't know.
I don't talk to you for days.

12:20.790 --> 12:24.252
Then the night before
Thanks giving--

12:24.377 --> 12:28.548
- Jesus Christ.
- Lucky guy's still alive.

12:28.631 --> 12:32.051
She took a razor to this orderly
up in Rockland.111 stitches to close him up.

12:32.177 --> 12:36.181
- What was the trigger?- Good question.
Been in and out of institutions for ten years.

12:36.264 --> 12:41.895
I see that. Selective mutism, obsessive-compulsive
behavior, post-traumatic symptoms.

12:42.020 --> 12:45.398
Twenty different hospitalizations,
twenty different diagnoses.

12:45.481 --> 12:49.903
Plus an I.Q off the charts. Apparently saw her
father killed by a subway when she was eight.

12:50.028 --> 12:52.197
- Dr. Sachs?
- What?

12:52.280 --> 12:56.075
The girl who was biting the heads off pigeons,
she has a med student in a headlock.

12:56.242 --> 12:59.245
Call security. Make sure the student
documents the attack and gets it co-signed.

12:59.412 --> 13:03.791
Louis, I don't know what the hell you want
from me. I got a family home waiting.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.752
Nathan, spend 15 minutes
with her.

13:05.877 --> 13:10.215
She's an 18-year-old girl,
never hurt a fly until last week.

13:10.298 --> 13:14.093
You and I are the only thing that stands between
her and a lifetime of Thorazine or worse.

13:14.177 --> 13:17.639
Wait! What do you mean,” you and I,"Kemo-sabe?
She's your patient.

13:17.722 --> 13:19.265
You're an asshole.
Okay?

13:19.390 --> 13:23.269
You're a big asshole
for making me say this.

13:23.394 --> 13:27.065
You're better at this stuff than I am, okay?
You're better, you're better.

13:27.148 --> 13:29.651
Everybody knows about Nathan Conrad and
the famous touch with the teens.

13:29.776 --> 13:32.779
Elisabeth Burrows. This is the kind of case
you and I used to live for!

13:32.904 --> 13:36.908
Before you went uptown on me.
Just kidding. I didn't mean it that way.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.077
Look.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.120
She needs you.

13:41.246 --> 13:44.958
All right, she needs me.
But what's the emergency? Why tonight?

13:45.041 --> 13:48.628
If we don't make some progress by Monday,
they're gonna ship her to Creedmore...

13:48.711 --> 13:50.755
and chain her to a bed
for the rest of her natural life.

13:50.839 --> 13:54.175
That's why.
That's why she needs you now.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.469
Five minutes.
Five minutes!

13:58.596 --> 14:01.307
Arnie, Frankie, good evening.

14:01.474 --> 14:04.143
- Dr. Conrad, are you slumming tonight?
- Afraid so.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.271
- You guys up for a cavity search?
- I'll pass.

14:06.437 --> 14:09.357
But Dr. Sachs,
he's always ready for one.

14:09.482 --> 14:13.319
On the gate.

14:13.444 --> 14:18.491
- What's the new cocktail?
- Haldol, droperidol and Ativan.

14:18.616 --> 14:21.119
- And she's awake?
- Oh, yes, she's awake.

14:21.202 --> 14:24.789
- He told me to stay.
- Come on, sweetheart.

14:24.914 --> 14:27.667
- Is she eating?
- Not eating, drinking, sleeping,

14:27.750 --> 14:30.670
bathing, letting anybody touch her...

14:30.753 --> 14:32.755
or saying a word.

14:35.633 --> 14:38.678
- Dr. Sachs, he told me to stay.
- I'll have a word with him.

14:38.803 --> 14:41.556
I promise, Louise.
I promise.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.980
What's with
the heavy artillery?

14:49.105 --> 14:53.818
Well, it took about five guys to get
her off the poor fellow at Rockland.

14:58.364 --> 15:01.534
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

15:01.618 --> 15:03.494
No.

15:03.494 --> 15:03.995
No.

15:04.078 --> 15:05.997
No.

15:06.080 --> 15:10.168
Would you open
the door, please?

15:10.293 --> 15:12.545
- Are you okay?
- Am I okay?

15:12.670 --> 15:14.839
- Yeah.
- I'm okay.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.830
Hello.

15:50.875 --> 15:53.253
Elisabeth, my name is Dr. Conrad.

15:53.336 --> 15:55.880
I'm a psychiatrist.

15:57.382 --> 16:00.552
Word has it that you haven't eaten for days.

16:00.677 --> 16:03.221
Well, I can understand that.

16:03.304 --> 16:08.017
I used to work in this hospital.
I know what the food's like.

16:15.608 --> 16:19.195
Elisabeth, would you mind
if I took your pulse?

16:21.865 --> 16:24.742
That means I'm gonna have to touch you.

17:12.874 --> 17:15.168
Now that's not supposed to happen.

17:15.293 --> 17:19.797
True catatonics have what's called
a waxy fexibility of their limbs.

17:19.881 --> 17:24.344
That means they stay
exactly where they're posed.

17:26.012 --> 17:28.139
There's more to you
than meets the eye, Elisabeth.

17:28.306 --> 17:31.559
You're very, very good
at what you do.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.776
So is there anything
you want to talk about?

17:46.991 --> 17:51.120
Well, that's okay.
We hardly know each other.

17:55.416 --> 18:00.547
I know you must have been very frightened
to do what you did to that guy.

18:00.713 --> 18:04.759
I know that you were angry,
because I saw those photos.

18:06.344 --> 18:09.889
But I also know
that you’re in a lot of pain.

18:09.973 --> 18:13.768
Because nobody's in this place
without a reason.

18:16.855 --> 18:18.940
So maybe we'll talk
next week.

18:25.154 --> 18:27.156
You want what they want.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.119
Don't you?

18:35.206 --> 18:37.625
What who wants?

18:43.631 --> 18:46.885
Elisabeth,
what who wants?

18:54.767 --> 18:56.769
Any of you.

18:56.853 --> 18:59.105
Any of you.

19:01.191 --> 19:03.276
Any of you.

19:57.580 --> 20:00.124
H-Hello?

20:06.798 --> 20:10.134
Who are you?

20:17.684 --> 20:20.186
Five to three,
this old bag doesn't have cable.

20:20.311 --> 20:23.481
I need my Sports Center.

20:29.654 --> 20:32.574
Dinner's over!

20:40.456 --> 20:42.917
How you doin', Tony?

20:43.042 --> 20:46.004
- Good. How you doin'? Nice to see you again.
- You too.

21:00.435 --> 21:02.478
Hello!

21:04.022 --> 21:09.277
This certainly looks
like the Conrad residence.

21:09.402 --> 21:14.032
It smells
like the Conrad residence.

21:14.157 --> 21:17.202
And it is definitely
overheated...

21:17.327 --> 21:20.622
like the Conrad residence.

21:24.042 --> 21:28.755
But it doesn't sound
like the Conrad residence.

21:28.880 --> 21:33.927
Hi, honey.
I'm looking for a little girl...

21:34.052 --> 21:37.222
about four feet two, light brown hair.

21:39.641 --> 21:41.559
Huh.

21:41.643 --> 21:44.187
Where did she go?

21:47.065 --> 21:51.110
Well, if I don't find
that little girl,

21:51.277 --> 21:56.157
I'm gonna have to go downstairs
and find myself another little girl.

21:57.367 --> 22:00.161
I'll be back in ten minutes.

22:02.830 --> 22:05.458
- Hi!
- Hi, Daddy.

22:05.542 --> 22:08.461
- How are you?
- Look what I did in art class today.

22:08.545 --> 22:13.341
That's beautiful. Look at the colors.
You got such a unique vision.

22:13.466 --> 22:15.677
It's my vision, I swear.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.846
Aren't you supposed
to be in bed?

22:17.971 --> 22:20.098
I can't sleep.
I have mental problems.

22:20.181 --> 22:23.810
- I see. What kind of mental problems?
- I'm highly neurotic.

22:23.935 --> 22:26.813
- You've been in my study again.
- I needed the stapler.

22:26.896 --> 22:28.940
Go say good night to Mom.

22:29.107 --> 22:31.442
- You're late.

22:31.526 --> 22:33.486
- Night, Mommy.
- Night, baby.

22:33.570 --> 22:35.864
- Did you brush your teeth? Can I smell?
- Yeah.

22:35.989 --> 22:37.991
Mmm, delicious.

22:38.116 --> 22:41.286
I'm gonna put monkey
by you on that side,

22:41.369 --> 22:45.081
and I'll put Sally over here
to keep you company.

22:47.959 --> 22:51.671
- You had a bad day.
- Why do you say that?

22:51.796 --> 22:54.632
Frown face!

22:54.716 --> 22:58.970
If I had a frown face, it's because it's
after 10:00 and you're still awake.

22:59.137 --> 23:01.556
Where were you tonight?

23:01.681 --> 23:04.642
I was working.

23:04.767 --> 23:06.728
Why?

23:06.811 --> 23:11.107
Because I was helping
a young girl.

23:12.734 --> 23:15.737
All right, but
that's gonna cost ya.

23:15.820 --> 23:18.406
All right,
what's it gonna be?

23:19.991 --> 23:23.703
One hug... two kisses.

23:23.828 --> 23:27.373
Two kisses? Boy, you cut
a tough deal. Okay.

23:27.498 --> 23:30.710
Here's one hug.
Mmmmm.

23:30.877 --> 23:33.046
And one kiss.

23:33.171 --> 23:36.799
And two kisses.

23:36.883 --> 23:39.219
Will they put Bart Simpson
in the parade tomorrow?

23:39.344 --> 23:44.349
They will put Bart Simpson in the
parade if you go to sleep right now.

23:44.432 --> 23:48.353
Okay, but I don't think they'll
care if I go to sleep or not.

23:50.897 --> 23:53.525
Good night, sweetheart.
I love you.

23:53.608 --> 23:56.528
I love you too.

24:33.022 --> 24:36.067
- Let me give you a hand, Detective.
- Thanks.

24:36.192 --> 24:38.111
That's beautiful.

24:40.113 --> 24:42.949
What exactly is beautiful?

24:43.074 --> 24:46.452
- Your jacket, the leatherjacket. It’s beautiful.
- Right.

24:49.330 --> 24:51.457
- Did you read about the Manhattan Bridge?
- No.

24:51.541 --> 24:55.295
Actually, it was builtwrong, moves ten feet.
But it's still standing.

24:55.378 --> 24:57.297
- Syd Simon.
- I'll see you later.

24:57.380 --> 24:59.299
Detective Cassidy.
What can I do for you?

24:59.382 --> 25:01.676
What have we got?

25:01.801 --> 25:04.929
Floater, female,
no I.D.

25:05.054 --> 25:06.890
She's maybe in her 20s.

25:09.267 --> 25:13.188
The sloughing of her skin tells me she's
been in the water maybe two, three days.

25:13.313 --> 25:15.815
This time of year with
the water cold? Could be longer.

25:15.982 --> 25:18.526
Couple, three days tops.

25:23.406 --> 25:27.785
Her hands have been tied.
They recover any rope or anything?

25:27.869 --> 25:30.580
They're still looking.

25:33.166 --> 25:36.169
Another body was found,
a couple days ago.

25:36.252 --> 25:38.171
- Battery Park area.
- Yeah.

25:38.296 --> 25:41.007
Victim was male, middle-aged.
Day before yesterday.

25:41.132 --> 25:44.135
All right. I'm gonna need
preliminary findings by tonight.

25:44.260 --> 25:48.181
Dream on, Detective.
I got six, seven cases piled up.

25:48.264 --> 25:52.519
Syd, I got important doings planned for
Thanks giving. Do me right, all right?

25:52.644 --> 25:55.855
- Tomorrow's the best I can do.
- Thank you.

25:55.980 --> 25:58.399
First thing though.

26:07.325 --> 26:10.703
Cars have been towed, the roads plowed,

26:10.828 --> 26:12.997
so the annual Turkey Trot--

26:16.835 --> 26:19.128
You can't be distracted.

26:21.798 --> 26:24.676
Here you are.
Immobile,

26:29.180 --> 26:31.140
totally exposed...

26:32.725 --> 26:35.353
and quite vulnerable.

26:38.189 --> 26:40.400
I think you need a bath.

26:40.483 --> 26:42.235
- Guess what, sweetie?
- What?

26:42.318 --> 26:47.699
- I already had a bath.
- You did? Ah, well, you didn't have...

26:47.782 --> 26:52.579
the Nathan Conrad fantastic
special bath, did you?

26:52.745 --> 26:54.622
- No.
- No, you didn't do that.

26:54.747 --> 26:57.917
I didn't get that one yet.

26:58.042 --> 27:01.421
- Pretty hot? Not too hot, is it?
- No, it's nice.

27:01.546 --> 27:05.425
Oh, good.

27:05.550 --> 27:10.930
-I didn't know a thing
about my legacy-

27:11.055 --> 27:14.267
- When I feel like
you were there for me--

27:14.350 --> 27:16.603
We should keep it down.

27:16.728 --> 27:20.440
You're the one that makes the noise.

28:11.032 --> 28:14.494
Prepare to die
of delight!

28:14.619 --> 28:17.872
Jessie, come on.
Let's join the downhill racer.

28:22.961 --> 28:25.463
I heard that about
the "downhill racer."

28:25.547 --> 28:27.882
You were dreaming.
I didn't say anything.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.635
- It was icy, you know?
- I know it was, baby.

28:30.760 --> 28:34.514
- And very windy too.
- It was a hell ride. Good morning.

28:34.806 --> 28:37.433
Morning. You think
she's still sleeping?

28:37.559 --> 28:40.854
I don't know.
Jessie?

28:40.979 --> 28:44.107
Jessie, come on.
The parade's gonna start soon.

28:47.652 --> 28:51.531
All right, I'm gonna go there
all by myself.

28:51.614 --> 28:54.367
See all those foats alone.

28:57.912 --> 29:01.541
Jessie, come on.
Breakfast is getting cold.

29:01.666 --> 29:05.003
Does she have a new hiding place
that I don't know about?

29:05.128 --> 29:09.674
Probably. She's been running around
the house like a wildcat all week.

29:09.799 --> 29:13.219
Jessie, get in here right now!

29:13.344 --> 29:16.097
Honey, eat it up
before it gets cold.

29:16.222 --> 29:21.769
Nathan, she wouldn't go out
on the balcony, right?

29:46.377 --> 29:48.755
She's not there.

29:48.880 --> 29:52.258
She knows better than to go outside
without asking us, doesn't she?

29:52.342 --> 29:55.512
Jessie, get in here right now!

30:24.123 --> 30:27.919
You get outta here and go home
and enjoy your Thanks giving.

30:28.002 --> 30:30.129
She lost one of her socks.

30:30.213 --> 30:33.299
- What?
- She's gone.

30:33.424 --> 30:35.093
What do you mean,” She’s gone"?
Wait--

30:35.093 --> 30:36.261
What do you mean,” She’s gone"?
Wait--

30:36.386 --> 30:40.139
- Somebody came in.
- No, no. She's in the hallway.

30:40.223 --> 30:42.642
- Somebody took her.
- Nobody took her, Nathan.

30:42.767 --> 30:47.772
- They broke in. They cut the chain on the door.
- What?

30:47.939 --> 30:50.817
Call the police!

30:50.900 --> 30:52.986
I can't get a dial tone.

30:53.111 --> 30:55.989
Get off the line.
This is an emergency.

30:56.072 --> 30:58.449
There's something wrong
with the goddamn phone.

30:58.533 --> 31:01.995
- There is nothing wrong with the phone, Nathan.
- Get off, this is an emergency.

31:02.078 --> 31:05.039
I know.

31:06.457 --> 31:10.211
- Who is this?
- We have your daughter.

31:12.964 --> 31:15.842
- What--
- Who is it?

31:16.009 --> 31:21.389
- What's your worst fear, Nathan?
- What are they saying?

31:21.472 --> 31:24.559
- The first shock can buckle the knees.
Any truth in that? - Where is she?

31:24.684 --> 31:26.311
- She's unharmed.
- Give it to me!

31:26.436 --> 31:30.523
I don't want to have to hurt her.
I want something from you.

31:30.648 --> 31:32.525
- No.
- What?

31:32.650 --> 31:34.319
Not until...

31:34.444 --> 31:38.865
I talk to my daughter,
and I know she's okay.

31:38.990 --> 31:42.368
Rule number one: You do not make demands.
You listen to what I tell you.

31:42.493 --> 31:47.498
You call me back when
I can talk to my daughter.

31:47.582 --> 31:49.709
- What are you doing?
- Aggie.

31:49.834 --> 31:51.753
- What the hell are you doing?
- Listen to me.

31:51.878 --> 31:54.756
- No! Are you crazy?
- Listen to me!

31:54.881 --> 31:59.010
- No! No! - Aggie, we have to make
sure she's all right.

31:59.135 --> 32:01.513
What if they don't call back?

32:07.852 --> 32:09.729
Hello?

32:09.854 --> 32:12.732
- Daddy?
- Jessie, are you okay, sweetie?

32:12.815 --> 32:15.568
Honey, have they hurt you?

32:15.693 --> 32:18.571
No. Daddy, can I
come home now? Daddy!

32:18.696 --> 32:20.406
Jessie!

32:20.532 --> 32:24.035
That was very brave, Nathan.

32:24.160 --> 32:26.621
- Tell me how much money you want!
- I don't want your money.

32:26.746 --> 32:30.458
Pick up your wife
before she breaks the other leg.

32:38.550 --> 32:41.803
What?
Nathan, what is it?

32:47.225 --> 32:50.395
Don't close the curtains.
I like the view.

32:50.478 --> 32:53.731
Good. Now.

32:53.857 --> 32:58.570
On the bureau by the door is a cell phone.
I know what you're thinking. Don't.

32:58.736 --> 33:01.489
By the time you hit the "1"
in 911,Jessie will be dead.

33:01.614 --> 33:05.952
Rule number two.:
Do not try to call or signal anyone.

33:06.077 --> 33:08.955
If you do, I will kill your daughter.
Not because I want to,

33:09.038 --> 33:12.458
but because those are the rules,
do you understand?

33:12.542 --> 33:15.712
- Yes.
- What?

33:17.755 --> 33:20.466
I can see you.
I can hear you.

33:20.592 --> 33:23.261
When you leave your building, wherever
you go, you will be watched.

33:23.386 --> 33:27.599
So if you want to see your daughter
alive, don't say a word.

33:27.682 --> 33:31.978
- Now, tell me you understand.
- I understand.

33:32.103 --> 33:34.647
Good. You have
a probono patient.

33:34.814 --> 33:38.985
Her name is Elisabeth Burrows.
A very disturbed girl.

33:39.110 --> 33:44.657
She has a six-digit number in her head,
locked away in her troubled mind.

33:44.782 --> 33:46.993
She guards it with her life.

33:47.118 --> 33:50.330
- What kind of number?
- That needn't concern you right now.

33:50.455 --> 33:55.293
I need that number. You need your daughter
back. That is why this is happening.

33:55.376 --> 33:57.504
You're a professional, Nathan, so am I.

33:57.629 --> 33:59.672
If we both do our jobs
to the best of our abilities,

33:59.797 --> 34:05.220
by this time tomorrow, it will be like...
we never even knew each other.

34:05.345 --> 34:08.806
Now, go back to Bridgeview.

34:08.973 --> 34:11.309
Take the Rover.

34:11.392 --> 34:14.812
No police, no detours.
And, Nathan,

34:14.896 --> 34:17.649
Aggie will be fine.

34:19.108 --> 34:21.486
Rule number three.:

34:21.569 --> 34:23.863
You have until 5:00 p.m. today.

34:33.039 --> 34:36.459
Let's do exactly what he says.

34:36.626 --> 34:41.089
- Nathan, why don't we just call the police?
- Because we can't.

34:41.214 --> 34:44.801
- Nathan!
- Because I believe him.

35:34.726 --> 35:36.186
Happy Thanksgiving.

35:43.693 --> 35:45.737
Asshole.

35:45.862 --> 35:48.448
Hey, Dr. Conrad, aren't you
and Jessie hitting the parade?

35:48.615 --> 35:50.909
She's got a cold.

36:06.633 --> 36:09.427
No signs of sexual assault.

36:09.511 --> 36:12.347
I see evidence of injury in her neck.

36:12.472 --> 36:16.601
Signs of bleeding in the strap muscles
overlying her larynx.

36:16.726 --> 36:20.980
I don't know, Syd. This girl does not
match any of my missing persons.

36:21.105 --> 36:26.152
Also evidence of a fracture
on the left tip of her hyoid bone.

36:26.277 --> 36:28.988
- Syd, how'd she die?
- No blunt instrument here.

36:29.113 --> 36:32.992
- Her neck was snapped in two.
- By what?

36:33.076 --> 36:35.662
By two hands.

36:35.787 --> 36:39.165
- By two hands.

36:39.249 --> 36:43.878
Syd, the same technique used
on this Battery Park foater?

36:50.927 --> 36:53.471
Same dislocation
of the skull.

36:53.596 --> 36:56.850
- And the splotches on the body?
- Cigarette burns.

36:56.933 --> 36:59.519
He was tortured.
Thank you.

36:59.644 --> 37:02.146
And he had prison tats.
Okay.

37:02.230 --> 37:05.692
I'm gonna need fingerprints and dental
X rays on our Jane Doe, pronto.

37:05.817 --> 37:09.028
You know, this is Thanks giving.

37:11.155 --> 37:13.658
You're right.
You are right.

37:13.741 --> 37:17.537
All right, well, I hope her family isn't
waiting on her to carve the turkey.

37:20.456 --> 37:24.335
Cassidy, I'm not susceptible
to your "guilting me" bullshit.

37:26.045 --> 37:28.548
She probably helped her mom
with the dishes.

37:35.597 --> 37:37.682
Fingerprints and dentals.

37:37.807 --> 37:40.894
- Then I'm the hell outta here.
- Thank you, Syd.

38:14.511 --> 38:16.346
Whoa!

38:42.288 --> 38:45.208
Come on!

39:07.647 --> 39:10.650
Roll down your window, sir.

39:13.361 --> 39:15.655
- Officer, I'm a doctor.
- Congratulations.

39:15.780 --> 39:18.658
You happen to notice the tuba player
that rolled off your hood?

39:18.741 --> 39:20.952
I need to get through
this parade.

39:21.035 --> 39:24.163
I need an escort to the Bridgeview
Psychiatric Hospital right now.

39:24.289 --> 39:28.543
Do I look like a freaking helicopter?
Use 57th Street.

39:35.300 --> 39:37.969
He's talking to the cops.

39:38.136 --> 39:40.847
- What'll we do?
- Be patient.

39:41.014 --> 39:45.435
There's a young girl who
could die, so, Officer Kreidman,

39:45.560 --> 39:49.814
you can either help me
save this girl... or not.

39:55.153 --> 39:58.656
I need two guys.
The two of you. Let's go.

39:58.740 --> 40:02.368
Right over there.
Come on, come on.

40:02.493 --> 40:05.705
Hold the band.
Hold the band right there.

40:05.788 --> 40:08.499
Open those gates for me, guys.

40:08.583 --> 40:11.044
Son of a bitch.

40:11.169 --> 40:14.964
He just picked up a police escort
and cut through the parade.

40:43.618 --> 40:46.746
- I like that.
- What?

40:46.913 --> 40:49.874
The police escort.
I like it a lot.

40:49.999 --> 40:54.420
- You didn't tell me the context of the number.
- She knows.

40:54.546 --> 40:58.550
Look, this girl has
a decade of pathology to unravel.

40:58.633 --> 41:03.263
Even if she knows,
your 5:00 deadline is absurd.

41:03.388 --> 41:06.391
In my experience, people are at their
best when facing unreasonable deadlines.

41:06.516 --> 41:09.602
You can't just flick
a switch in the girl's head.

41:09.727 --> 41:12.689
You have to trust me. It does
not work that way in these cases.

41:12.814 --> 41:18.403
Look, the money's bad, I know.
But you have family obligations.

41:18.570 --> 41:21.906
And, Nathan,
don't lose the phone.

42:09.871 --> 42:13.708
- The doctor has landed.
- Did he double alarm the car?

42:13.833 --> 42:16.961
- Nope.
- Good. We've got him focused.

42:17.086 --> 42:19.506
- Do you have the key to Dr. Sachs's office?
- Yeah.

42:19.589 --> 42:22.383
- Could you open it, please? Open it.
- But Dr. Sachs isn't here.

43:28.116 --> 43:30.869
I thought Nathan
explained the rules very clearly.

43:30.994 --> 43:33.454
Put the cell phone back.

43:36.332 --> 43:39.586
There's no percentage
in breaking those rules.

43:39.711 --> 43:44.215
You sick son of a bitch!
You hurt my little girl and I'll--

43:44.340 --> 43:46.551
You'll do what?

43:46.634 --> 43:49.429
You were about
to say something personal.

43:49.554 --> 43:51.431
I think.

43:51.556 --> 43:53.474
- No.
- That's good.

43:53.600 --> 43:56.769
If your husband is on his game today,
you've got nothing to worry about.

43:56.853 --> 44:00.273
There's a good side to this, Aggie.
This will bring you...

44:00.398 --> 44:03.234
much closer
than the occasional ski trip...

44:03.359 --> 44:07.155
or sponge bath.

44:07.280 --> 44:11.743
The remote is to your left.
Pick it up.

44:11.910 --> 44:14.120
Pick it up!

44:16.581 --> 44:19.751
Good.
Now turn it on.

44:19.876 --> 44:22.295
North Carolinais tops--

44:22.420 --> 44:23.796
Try HBO.

44:29.260 --> 44:32.931
No, I've seen this.
Bit too violent.

44:33.056 --> 44:34.933
Try a nice family drama.

45:23.147 --> 45:25.024
Nathan!

45:25.149 --> 45:27.610
- What are you doing here? -
You're not supposed to be here.

45:27.735 --> 45:29.904
How'd you get in?
Who let you in?

45:30.029 --> 45:32.490
You're supposed to be in
Greenwich with Kim and her family.

45:32.615 --> 45:34.826
Why are you here
on Thanks giving?

45:34.909 --> 45:38.204
Why am I here? I gotta
testify in a double homicide...

45:38.329 --> 45:41.666
on Monday, and I thought
I'd come do research.

45:41.749 --> 45:45.336
What?
You broke into my files!

45:45.461 --> 45:48.882
Those are my per--
I would've given you the key, man.

45:49.048 --> 45:51.384
Have you gone through all of this?

45:51.467 --> 45:53.761
Well, not all of it.
I just got here.

45:53.887 --> 45:56.848
I've been through the master file.
It's a swamp of misdiagnoses.

45:56.973 --> 46:00.059
- I think she's overlaying.
- Overlaying?

46:00.143 --> 46:02.604
Louis,
she is a brilliant mimic.

46:02.729 --> 46:05.565
That's why Rockland couldn't
figure her out. She's highly adaptive.

46:05.648 --> 46:08.067
She takes on the symptoms
of other patients.

46:08.151 --> 46:11.404
She's like a counterfeit
schizophrenic, maybe.

46:11.529 --> 46:14.032
Come on, I-- I can't believe
it's all smoke and mirrors.

46:14.157 --> 46:17.118
That would place her
in the malingerer’ shall of fame.

46:17.243 --> 46:20.079
I gotta believe there's some sort
of genuine pathology beneath it all.

46:20.205 --> 46:24.584
She has classic post-traumatic stress symptoms.
Her P.T.S.D. is real.

46:24.667 --> 46:29.714
Seeing her father die.
That was ground zero.

46:29.839 --> 46:35.386
She also believes that something
or somebody is after her.

46:35.512 --> 46:38.598
And that is why she stayed
institutionalized these past ten years.

46:38.723 --> 46:41.809
She wants to stay inside.

46:43.895 --> 46:47.774
So 20 different
hospitalizations,

46:47.857 --> 46:50.109
twenty different diagnoses.

46:50.276 --> 46:51.903
All overlaying.

46:52.028 --> 46:55.573
Nathan, that would make her
a very,

46:55.698 --> 46:57.659
very talented young lady,
wouldn't it?

46:57.784 --> 46:59.869
Or desperate.

47:19.055 --> 47:22.308
- Louis?
- Yeah?

47:22.433 --> 47:26.813
Does anybody know I'm treating
Elisabeth Burrows besides you?

47:26.938 --> 47:31.651
Everybody. I put it up last night after
you left. Figured you might be back.

47:31.776 --> 47:35.196
I wanted you to have clearance in case I
wasn't around. Also reinstated your password.

47:35.321 --> 47:37.156
Gate, please!

47:53.131 --> 47:56.843
- Elisabeth, good morning.

47:57.010 --> 48:01.973
- Feeling better?

48:03.850 --> 48:08.146
I brought you something.

48:08.229 --> 48:11.191
A chocolate turkey.

48:11.274 --> 48:14.611
The sugar will help you metabolize all
those meds they've been giving you.

48:20.450 --> 48:22.660
You like Thanks giving?

48:22.744 --> 48:25.788
It's my favorite holiday.

48:35.048 --> 48:37.258
Wanna touch?

48:37.383 --> 48:39.344
Sorry?

48:39.511 --> 48:41.846
I saw you looking.

48:41.930 --> 48:44.557
I know what you're trying to do.
You want to embarrass me.

48:44.682 --> 48:47.060
It won't work.

48:53.816 --> 48:56.569
The other doctor?

48:56.694 --> 48:59.155
- Dr. Sachs.
- Yeah.

49:00.615 --> 49:02.951
I don't like him.

49:03.076 --> 49:05.703
Well, I can understand that.

49:05.870 --> 49:07.747
Very fucking funny.

49:09.916 --> 49:13.294
Elisabeth, there's something
important I have to ask you.

49:16.673 --> 49:19.092
But first
I want to show you something.

49:21.010 --> 49:25.223
I have a daughter.
She's eight... going on eighteen.

49:27.559 --> 49:30.103
Her name's Jessie.

49:32.021 --> 49:36.276
I have some of
her favorite things here.

49:36.401 --> 49:39.070
This is Horton Hearsa Who.

49:39.237 --> 49:43.616
I've read it to her so many times,
it's pretty worn by now.

49:49.372 --> 49:53.585
And this. She loves to draw
weird pictures of me.

50:10.310 --> 50:13.271
And this--

50:13.396 --> 50:15.356
This is Sally.

50:18.151 --> 50:20.111
Would you like one of those?

50:20.236 --> 50:24.490
I'll make sure the hospital
lets you keep it.

50:24.616 --> 50:29.120
- But you can only choose one.
- What the hell is this, Toys "R" Us?

50:29.245 --> 50:31.789
Want me to choose for you?

50:38.046 --> 50:42.717
Choose 'fore you lose. For you choose
'fore you lose for you--

50:43.968 --> 50:47.180
- Dr. Conrad?
- Yes?

50:47.305 --> 50:49.265
Get out.

50:51.309 --> 50:53.186
No.

50:53.311 --> 50:56.689
I want you to leave.

50:56.773 --> 51:01.694
- We're not finished talking, Elisabeth.
- I know what you're trying to do.

51:01.819 --> 51:04.322
You wanna embarrass me.

51:04.447 --> 51:06.199
It won't work.

51:11.913 --> 51:13.790
What's your name?

51:16.543 --> 51:18.670
Your hair's really long.

51:21.798 --> 51:26.010
My hair used to be that long,
but my mom made me cut it.

51:27.846 --> 51:30.682
What's that thing
on your neck?

51:32.767 --> 51:36.563
It's kind of impolite not
to answer someone's question.

51:41.150 --> 51:43.111
It's a symbol.

51:45.280 --> 51:47.365
What's it mean?

51:47.448 --> 51:49.075
No talk.

51:49.200 --> 51:53.037
Elisabeth, there's something
I need to know.

51:53.162 --> 51:54.956
Jessie.

51:55.081 --> 51:58.918
Jessie?
That's my little girl's name.

51:59.043 --> 52:03.047
You wanna see a picture
that Jessie drew?

52:03.131 --> 52:05.425
I'll make you a deal.

52:05.550 --> 52:08.928
I'll show you the picture
if you answer my question.

52:09.012 --> 52:13.349
Is it worth just one answer?
I don't mean a "yes" and "no" answer.

52:14.475 --> 52:16.394
Maybe.

52:16.477 --> 52:21.274
I'm gonna ask my question now.

52:21.399 --> 52:23.610
Is the man that you hurt
at Rockland--

52:23.776 --> 52:27.238
Did that have anything to do
with the terrible thing...

52:27.363 --> 52:29.657
that happened to you
in the subway years ago?

52:29.782 --> 52:33.411
Run, honey, run! Shit!
Run, honey, run!

52:37.832 --> 52:41.586
- I didn't know what you
were talking about yesterday.

52:41.669 --> 52:45.298
- Run! - I didn't know who
they were or what they wanted.

52:45.423 --> 52:48.134
- Leave!
- Now I do. I know how bad they wanted it.

52:48.259 --> 52:53.640
- I know how important it was for you to
hold onto it. - Leave! Leave! Leave!

52:53.723 --> 52:56.935
- Leave! Leave! Leave!
- Elisabeth--

52:57.060 --> 53:00.480
Get out!
Leave! Leave!

53:00.605 --> 53:03.107
Leave! Leave!

53:03.274 --> 53:05.026
Go!

53:09.239 --> 53:12.200
Thank you. I'm sorry.

53:16.120 --> 53:17.997
You lost her.

53:18.122 --> 53:22.335
She's still got the doll,
doesn't she?

53:50.238 --> 53:53.408
- Yeah?
- That went well.

53:53.533 --> 53:57.161
Look, I can gain her trust,
but without more information...

53:57.245 --> 54:00.540
- I'm shooting in the dark.
- The answer's right in front of you.

54:00.623 --> 54:02.709
I have gone through her files!
All right?

54:02.834 --> 54:04.669
Then look closer.

54:04.794 --> 54:07.255
- You--
- Nathan,

54:07.380 --> 54:11.509
- it's 12:22.

54:13.678 --> 54:15.221
I'm sure of one thing.

54:15.346 --> 54:19.184
They would have encountered
quite a few venomous species.

54:21.686 --> 54:24.189
Check this out.

54:24.272 --> 54:27.567
See how he's got his tail up?
He is grumpy.

54:27.650 --> 54:31.571
He gets his stinger back over
the top of his head, ready to grab.

54:31.696 --> 54:33.531
Whack! Sting!

54:38.703 --> 54:42.040
Signora Conrad?

54:42.165 --> 54:43.666
Sofia.

54:51.799 --> 54:54.594
Sofia, why are you here?

54:57.222 --> 55:01.059
Si,laporta.
I broke it. Mr. Conrad will fix it.

55:07.857 --> 55:10.109
- What? What?

55:10.235 --> 55:14.447
- Il tacchino.
- No, no, no. No tacchino.

55:16.616 --> 55:19.285
No telefono! No!
Just give it to me.

55:19.410 --> 55:22.830
- Excuse me. Dammelo. Grazie.

55:26.251 --> 55:28.127
Hello.

55:28.253 --> 55:29.796
Signora?

55:29.921 --> 55:31.798
Get rid of her.

55:32.882 --> 55:36.803
Sofia, uh, no tacchino.

55:36.928 --> 55:40.139
Oh. Si.

55:40.265 --> 55:41.891
Grazie. Arrivederci.

55:48.606 --> 55:51.526
- Any more visitors?
- No.

56:04.622 --> 56:09.878
Oh, come on, yeah.
Come on, baby, take it off. Come on.

56:13.214 --> 56:16.176
All right, suit yourself.

56:42.702 --> 56:45.246
I have to go.
You have to call me back.

56:46.414 --> 56:48.499
You seen this?

56:48.583 --> 56:52.587
What's this? "Girl found
wandering on Hart Island."

56:52.712 --> 56:55.840
- Where'd you find this?
- In her file in your office.

56:55.965 --> 56:58.885
"A young girl was found yesterday
among the coffins on Hart Island."

56:58.968 --> 57:02.263
This is around the time
that her father died.

57:02.388 --> 57:06.017
I should run this by Child Services.
Could she have been lost or unattended?

57:06.100 --> 57:09.020
- What-- That's very bizarre.
- On an island in the East River.

57:11.981 --> 57:14.400
I saw Sara two days ago.

57:14.526 --> 57:17.946
She was meeting her boyfriend in the Village.
Maybe she's still with him.

57:18.071 --> 57:20.240
She could be.
Wait one second.

57:22.367 --> 57:27.163
- Hey, Jake. Uh, tray 57,and just her face. Thanks.
- Yeah, okay.

57:27.288 --> 57:29.874
- Come on.
- It stinks in here. It smells weird.

57:29.999 --> 57:31.876
I know. Just breathe
through your mouth.

57:31.960 --> 57:36.214
- I've never seen anyone dead before.
- You'll do fine, okay?

57:36.297 --> 57:40.468
- I'm gonna get sick.
- Listen, no one in here is gonna mind. Okay?

57:40.593 --> 57:42.470
Come on.

57:46.891 --> 57:51.312
- Uh, listen, I've gotta take this.

57:51.437 --> 57:53.857
But I'm gonna be
right here. Okay?

57:56.442 --> 58:00.697
Cassidy.
Oh. Hey, baby. Yeah.

58:00.780 --> 58:03.283
Uh, no. You should take
the 1:00 because I--

58:03.408 --> 58:07.078
I'll beat Penn Station by 2:00.

58:07.161 --> 58:09.747
- Make it 7:00.
- I promise.

58:09.831 --> 58:12.125
- Don't promise.

58:12.250 --> 58:16.004
What? Yeah,
I'm almost done here.

58:16.129 --> 58:18.423
Yeah. I'm at the city morgue.

58:18.506 --> 58:21.092
- Bye.
- Mmm.

58:21.259 --> 58:24.637
That's your N.C.I.C.
on the guy with the busted neck.

58:24.762 --> 58:29.184
Oh, I got a hit.
Leon Edwards Croft.

58:31.769 --> 58:33.688
Jesus, what does he have,15,20 arrests?

58:33.813 --> 58:36.357
Well, he's a busy little bad guy.
Won't be missed.

58:36.482 --> 58:39.110
- You run him for known associates?
- Of course.

58:39.235 --> 58:41.696
Am I not a paid professional?

58:50.580 --> 58:53.374
- It's okay

58:53.499 --> 58:57.504
Why would someone do this to Sara?

58:57.670 --> 59:00.423
The guy with the cigarette burns,
Croft, he was the driver for this crew.

59:00.548 --> 59:05.178
Robbery said they hit banks
here, Jersey, Delaware, Virginia.

59:05.303 --> 59:07.764
No convictions till '91 .

59:07.889 --> 59:13.228
And, three of his friends just
capped off a ten-year  jolt in Attica.

59:13.353 --> 59:16.314
Patrick Barry Koster.
He's the last one that got out.

59:16.439 --> 59:20.235
November 4.
On November 4!

59:20.360 --> 59:22.820
Did Croft
rat these guys out?

59:22.904 --> 59:25.323
I don't know.
Could be payback.

59:25.406 --> 59:30.286
He has no priors. There is nothing on him.
He came out of nowhere. There's nothing.

59:30.370 --> 59:33.915
It's the only thing he ever
got popped for. Guy's a ghost.

59:34.040 --> 59:36.543
He's a ghost?

59:36.668 --> 59:39.295
Well, I guess that's who I need
to talk to, then. Thank you.

59:39.379 --> 59:41.130
- Watch your back.
- Yeah.

59:47.929 --> 59:52.433
Well, you picked Jessie's
absolutely favorite thing.

59:52.559 --> 59:57.105
She and Sally were inseparable
since they were two.

59:58.898 --> 1:00:01.860
Where is she?

1:00:01.985 --> 1:00:03.611
Where's Jessie?

1:00:06.906 --> 1:00:09.409
They took her.

1:00:09.492 --> 1:00:12.078
Now she's really scared.

1:00:12.203 --> 1:00:17.250
Asscaredas you were when you went after that
guy at Rockland, but she's only eight years old.

1:00:17.375 --> 1:00:19.752
She's not as strong as you are.

1:00:19.878 --> 1:00:22.714
She can't protect herself
as well as you can.

1:00:22.797 --> 1:00:28.595
See, I am not just here
to help you.

1:00:28.720 --> 1:00:33.224
- I need you to help me.

1:00:36.936 --> 1:00:39.856
Otherwise I'm not gettin'
my little girl back.

1:00:45.069 --> 1:00:46.946
Today's Thanks giving.

1:00:48.990 --> 1:00:51.409
You remember Thanks giving?

1:00:51.492 --> 1:00:54.954
Yes. Yes, I remember.

1:00:56.039 --> 1:00:57.832
Who were you with?

1:00:59.834 --> 1:01:01.753
My dad.

1:01:03.421 --> 1:01:06.758
Just me and my dad.

1:01:06.883 --> 1:01:10.595
Being strong isn't only
about protecting yourself,

1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:13.932
it's also having the strength to let go,
especially if you're holding on to something--

1:01:14.057 --> 1:01:19.229
holding on so tightly that you don't even
know that you could have a better life.

1:01:21.397 --> 1:01:25.693
The only way that you
can help yourself...

1:01:25.818 --> 1:01:27.445
is if you go back.

1:01:34.327 --> 1:01:38.122
You have to go back
to that day on the subway.

1:01:38.206 --> 1:01:40.250
I can't-- can't do it.

1:01:40.416 --> 1:01:42.502
No, I can't.

1:01:42.669 --> 1:01:45.004
Here we go. The main event.

1:01:45.129 --> 1:01:47.924
You can't help my little girl
unless you go back.

1:01:48.049 --> 1:01:50.385
No, please.

1:01:52.762 --> 1:01:55.181
Listen to me.

1:01:55.306 --> 1:01:58.476
The men that have Jessie...

1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:00.895
are the same men
that you're fighting.

1:02:01.020 --> 1:02:04.148
- They are the men that sent the orderly at
Rockland after you.- I don't want to hear this.

1:02:04.232 --> 1:02:06.401
All they want is a number.

1:02:06.526 --> 1:02:09.070
- You want what they want.
- They know that you know the number.

1:02:09.195 --> 1:02:12.532
- They're gonna kill my little
girl if you don't tell me. - Stop it.

1:02:12.699 --> 1:02:14.617
Daddy!

1:02:14.701 --> 1:02:16.911
- Is it a telephone number?
- No.

1:02:17.036 --> 1:02:19.038
- An address? An account?
- I don’t know.

1:02:19.122 --> 1:02:21.082
It's a bank account.
Is it a code?

1:02:21.207 --> 1:02:22.917
- No.
- Is it a place? What is it?

1:02:26.713 --> 1:02:28.631
What--

1:02:28.715 --> 1:02:32.427
- What's wrong? We lost the feed?
- No, no, we're good!

1:02:32.552 --> 1:02:36.764
You leave him alone.

1:02:38.183 --> 1:02:40.351
Your father is gone.

1:02:40.435 --> 1:02:45.565
He is gone, and no one
is gonna hurt him anymore.

1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:50.862
My little girl
is still alive.

1:02:50.987 --> 1:02:54.407
Jessie is alive.

1:03:05.293 --> 1:03:07.462
Dr. Conrad?

1:03:09.797 --> 1:03:12.592
I'm scared.

1:03:25.522 --> 1:03:27.732
I know.
I'm sorry.

1:03:27.857 --> 1:03:32.987
- Shit.
- It's okay. It's all right.

1:03:34.364 --> 1:03:36.282
- Elisabeth.
- I'll try.

1:03:36.407 --> 1:03:38.284
You're okay.

1:03:51.506 --> 1:03:53.424
Long time since breakfast,
huh?

1:03:55.260 --> 1:03:59.013
- Yeah.
- I wish we had some cheeseburgers.

1:04:03.268 --> 1:04:06.563
- Whisper I love you-

1:04:08.565 --> 1:04:12.193
- Birds singing in -

1:04:12.318 --> 1:04:16.322
Best turkey you ever had. Be careful.
I'll put you in the oven with it.

1:04:19.576 --> 1:04:22.912
- I love you, Daddy.
- Smile, sweet cheeks.

1:04:45.435 --> 1:04:50.148
- What's that?
- This is a 5cc syringe...

1:04:50.231 --> 1:04:53.193
with a ten-gauge needle and 500
milligrams of sodium Amytal.

1:04:53.318 --> 1:04:55.778
What are you talking about,
500 milligrams?

1:04:55.904 --> 1:04:59.032
Why don't you shove a quart of Jack Daniels
down her throat or stick a shotgun in her mouth?

1:04:59.199 --> 1:05:02.869
Look. The event is obviously
right beneath the surface.

1:05:02.994 --> 1:05:06.831
- She should respond beautifully
to Amytal, so I'm--

1:05:16.799 --> 1:05:18.593
Answer it.

1:05:27.519 --> 1:05:30.271
You answer the phone.

1:05:35.818 --> 1:05:38.363
Now, you tell them
everything's okay...

1:05:38.530 --> 1:05:40.782
and that you're going
to plan "B."

1:05:43.201 --> 1:05:47.914
Everything's okay,
and we're going to plan "B."

1:05:48.039 --> 1:05:50.041
It's a drug.

1:05:51.918 --> 1:05:55.880
You knew all about the numbers,
and you set me up, Louis.

1:05:56.005 --> 1:05:58.091
- I swear to God--
- You tell me why,

1:05:58.216 --> 1:06:02.303
- or I'll shove this - He's got my fucking
girlfriend! He's keeping Sara hostage!

1:06:02.428 --> 1:06:04.597
He's gonna kill her
if I don't get this number.

1:06:04.722 --> 1:06:06.724
- Your girlfriend, Louis?
- Yeah.

1:06:06.850 --> 1:06:10.311
- Well, he's got my daughter.

1:06:10.436 --> 1:06:14.274
- He's got my little girl.
- Nathan, I didn't know that.

1:06:14.399 --> 1:06:18.152
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

1:06:18.278 --> 1:06:20.989
You gotta get this number
for this guy. He'll just go away.

1:06:21.114 --> 1:06:22.824
- It's that simple.
- It's that simple.

1:06:22.949 --> 1:06:26.077
Dr. Sachs? Dr. Sachs?

1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:29.914
- Yes?
- There's a cop here to see you.

1:06:29.998 --> 1:06:34.252
- Cop? What kind of cop?
- I don't know.

1:06:34.335 --> 1:06:36.254
- What's he want?
- She.

1:06:36.337 --> 1:06:38.506
She didn't say, but she's
waiting in your office.

1:06:38.631 --> 1:06:41.426
Okay.

1:06:41.551 --> 1:06:43.761
Tell her
I'll be right there.

1:06:43.928 --> 1:06:45.847
Okay.

1:06:47.849 --> 1:06:50.435
He said no cops!
He told me absolutely no cops.

1:06:50.560 --> 1:06:53.271
Here's what you've gotta do. You have got
to go down to your office.

1:06:53.396 --> 1:06:55.315
- You have to be cool.
- But what--

1:06:55.398 --> 1:06:58.234
And you make her
go away.

1:07:15.335 --> 1:07:18.379
If we don't have  it
by 4:30, we go to plan "B."

1:07:43.821 --> 1:07:45.990
What is this?

1:08:01.047 --> 1:08:03.716
Peanut butter and jelly.
What kind of jelly is it?

1:08:08.763 --> 1:08:10.723
Hello there.

1:08:10.807 --> 1:08:15.103
- I'm Louis Sachs.
- Hi. Detective Cassidy.

1:08:16.479 --> 1:08:18.398
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:08:19.732 --> 1:08:21.734
Pretty girl.
Is that your daughter?

1:08:21.901 --> 1:08:26.739
This? No. This is not my daughter.
How can I help you today, Detective?

1:08:26.823 --> 1:08:29.367
- I'm here about this woman.
- What about her?

1:08:29.492 --> 1:08:33.204
- You don't know her?
- Nope.

1:08:45.925 --> 1:08:49.554
She worked in the hospital for five months.
She was a resident here.

1:08:49.637 --> 1:08:53.558
Really? Well, we have dozens and dozens
of residents. I will tell you that.

1:08:53.683 --> 1:08:55.935
She worked in the department
you oversee, Dr. Sachs.

1:08:56.102 --> 1:08:58.646
- She did?
- Mm-hmm.

1:08:58.771 --> 1:09:02.233
Well, that's strange, because in that case
I should know who she is, and I don't.

1:09:02.400 --> 1:09:06.279
- So there's gotta be a mistake.
- When did you last see Sara?

1:09:06.404 --> 1:09:10.992
Detective, I just told you,
and I'll tell you again,

1:09:11.117 --> 1:09:15.121
I do not know who that is.

1:09:22.670 --> 1:09:24.547
Where are we going?

1:09:25.715 --> 1:09:28.468
Do you have a lawyer, sir?

1:09:28.635 --> 1:09:30.929
- What?
- Do you have a lawyer?

1:09:31.054 --> 1:09:33.515
- What are you talking--
- You don't know Sara, right?

1:09:33.640 --> 1:09:36.476
No, I don't know Sara. But what are
we talking about lawyers for?

1:09:36.601 --> 1:09:39.145
A week ago,
in Central Park, with you.

1:09:39.270 --> 1:09:42.774
She told her roommate Vanessa all about it.
You know Vanessa, don’t you? She knows you.

1:09:42.899 --> 1:09:45.235
- I don't know Vanessa either.
- Dr. Sachs.

1:09:45.318 --> 1:09:47.946
- I'm about to read you your rights.
- My rights?

1:09:48.029 --> 1:09:49.531
- But first--
- What did I do?

1:09:49.656 --> 1:09:52.992
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Okay.

1:09:53.117 --> 1:09:57.705
This is last weekend, with you,
by the fountain in Central Park.

1:09:57.830 --> 1:10:01.543
You took this picture,
and this is her now.

1:10:01.709 --> 1:10:05.380
This one you did. This one I took.
Who do you think did better, me or you?

1:10:05.505 --> 1:10:09.092
- That's not Sara. - That's Sara all right.
That's Sara, laid out in the morgue.

1:10:09.175 --> 1:10:12.470
- No, it's not--
- I work Homicide, Dr. Sachs. That's Sara.

1:10:14.597 --> 1:10:16.516
The morgue?

1:10:24.357 --> 1:10:26.818
That's a mistake. It can't be
Sara. That's not the deal.

1:10:26.901 --> 1:10:29.654
- That's not the deal?
- That's not the deal.

1:10:29.737 --> 1:10:32.699
Okay. Why don't you tell me
what the fuck the deal is?

1:10:32.782 --> 1:10:34.993
Who is part of the deal?
Is he part of the deal?

1:10:35.118 --> 1:10:36.870
How about him? Or him?
Or him?

1:10:36.870 --> 1:10:38.329
How about him? Or him?
Or him?

1:10:38.454 --> 1:10:40.498
Tell me who is part of the deal!
Why don't you tell me?

1:10:40.623 --> 1:10:43.376
- He said we had until 5:00 today!
- Who's "we"?

1:10:43.501 --> 1:10:46.796
- So that's a mistake!
- That is not a mistake. Who's "we"?

1:10:46.880 --> 1:10:49.549
And we are so fucking close
and all we need is another half-hour--

1:10:49.632 --> 1:10:52.594
Dr. Sachs, who is we?
- That's not Sara!

1:10:52.719 --> 1:10:57.932
Why don't you quit wasting my fucking
time and tell me who's we?

1:10:58.099 --> 1:10:59.684
Hey.
You like country music?

1:10:59.684 --> 1:11:00.602
Hey.
You like country music?

1:11:00.727 --> 1:11:02.353
Mm-hmm.

1:11:09.819 --> 1:11:14.449
Low pressure over in Virginia, and that
is getting stronger by the minute.

1:11:14.574 --> 1:11:18.244
- Pink toe nails Got my--

1:11:21.915 --> 1:11:26.377
-All my girlfriends have time
for their pink toenails -

1:11:34.219 --> 1:11:38.973
- Baby doll when you find me
sitting there in my pink--

1:11:44.062 --> 1:11:46.439
What did I say about noise?

1:11:50.443 --> 1:11:53.446
Daddy's smart little girl,
aren't you?

1:11:53.571 --> 1:11:56.824
Better hope your mother
didn't hear that.

1:11:56.950 --> 1:11:59.786
Go full screen on her.

1:12:04.541 --> 1:12:06.793
Tighter.

1:12:26.312 --> 1:12:30.149
- She heard.
- How do you know?

1:12:31.568 --> 1:12:33.653
She stopped breathing.

1:13:00.847 --> 1:13:03.474
What can I do for you,
Doc?

1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:06.519
Arnie, I need to ask you a favor.

1:13:06.603 --> 1:13:09.772
Are you taking Burrows for a stroll?

1:13:13.693 --> 1:13:15.778
We're out ohere. Bring her!

1:13:15.904 --> 1:13:19.157
Mommy, Daddy, I'm up here!
Mommy!

1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:22.368
Mommy! Mommy!

1:13:24.329 --> 1:13:28.583
Let me outta here!

1:13:32.128 --> 1:13:34.047
Take care of her.

1:13:35.215 --> 1:13:37.342
I need you to open
the gates.

1:13:37.467 --> 1:13:39.093
On whose authorization?

1:13:39.219 --> 1:13:42.597
This is between you and me.

1:13:42.722 --> 1:13:46.351
See, that's why they call
this place the nuthouse, Doc.

1:13:46.476 --> 1:13:50.563
Cause I'd have to be basically
fuckin' nuts to let you do that.

1:13:52.148 --> 1:13:55.944
Okay. Well, you know,
I just had to ask you.

1:13:59.989 --> 1:14:03.576
It's okay, Arnie.
It’s just Versed.

1:14:03.701 --> 1:14:08.623
It's okay. It's all right.
You'll be all right in about an hour.

1:14:51.583 --> 1:14:55.295
Dr. Conrad?
Dr. Conrad!

1:14:56.671 --> 1:14:58.590
Doctor--

1:15:23.323 --> 1:15:25.825
Excuse me!

1:15:25.950 --> 1:15:27.827
Excuse me.

1:15:37.504 --> 1:15:41.174
Emergency procedures.
Officer down.

1:15:41.299 --> 1:15:44.177
We have a security breach.
Institute emergency procedures.

1:15:44.260 --> 1:15:46.304
Seal off main entrance.

1:15:49.307 --> 1:15:51.226
Sorry.

1:15:53.436 --> 1:15:55.021
Come on.

1:16:10.954 --> 1:16:13.581
Check out the radar close in.
Here's Hartford.

1:16:13.706 --> 1:16:16.125
Thirty degrees.

1:16:16.209 --> 1:16:19.587
- Primarily, it is--
- No!

1:16:39.107 --> 1:16:42.360
Central, be advised, a gold Land Rover
just left Bridgeview, headed east.

1:16:42.485 --> 1:16:45.738
- Okay. Leaving.
- The driver is Nathan Conrad,

1:16:45.864 --> 1:16:47.866
wanted for questioning
in connection with a homicide.

1:16:53.162 --> 1:16:56.791
- Have an R.M.P. respond
to his residence immediately.

1:17:51.763 --> 1:17:54.557
Oh, my God.

1:18:09.781 --> 1:18:12.033
- Yeah.

1:18:12.158 --> 1:18:15.328
- What's on your mind, Nathan?
- Field trip.

1:18:20.124 --> 1:18:23.294
- Wait a second.

1:18:23.461 --> 1:18:25.421
Where are you
taking Jessie?

1:18:25.505 --> 1:18:28.007
- Why are you moving her?
- You've got 44 minutes.

1:18:32.804 --> 1:18:34.848
Why are you moving her?

1:18:39.227 --> 1:18:41.813
I will get you the number.

1:18:41.896 --> 1:18:43.815
Just don't hurt her.

1:18:43.898 --> 1:18:47.026
Forty-three minutes.

1:18:58.329 --> 1:19:01.583
You have reached New York City's
emergency services.

1:19:01.708 --> 1:19:05.879
Please stay on the line. Your call will
be answered in the order it was received.

1:19:09.966 --> 1:19:12.886
You crippled bitch!

1:20:15.281 --> 1:20:17.867
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1:20:34.050 --> 1:20:36.803
No!

1:20:40.807 --> 1:20:43.101
This is where it happened,
isn't it, Elisabeth?

1:20:43.226 --> 1:20:45.228
No.

1:20:47.564 --> 1:20:51.192
When we left home,
my dad and me--

1:20:53.736 --> 1:20:55.822
I think we--

1:20:57.240 --> 1:20:58.741
A big car, dark.

1:21:02.370 --> 1:21:04.289
I'd never seen my dad
so scared.

1:21:04.372 --> 1:21:08.126
He grabbed my arm. He kept
running and running and running.

1:21:08.251 --> 1:21:10.461
And I tried to keep up.

1:21:14.632 --> 1:21:17.051
I tried to keep up.
He took--

1:21:19.345 --> 1:21:22.432
- Ah, you can do it.
- Okay.

1:21:22.515 --> 1:21:24.309
You can do it.
Let's go.

1:21:24.392 --> 1:21:26.686
I tried to keep up.

1:21:30.481 --> 1:21:32.358
It's okay.

1:21:37.238 --> 1:21:39.824
Elisabeth.

1:21:39.908 --> 1:21:42.869
There were lots of people,

1:21:42.952 --> 1:21:47.207
but my dad just
pulled me through them.

1:21:47.332 --> 1:21:49.584
I looked back.

1:21:51.002 --> 1:21:53.922
They were so fast.

1:21:54.047 --> 1:21:56.925
They're still behind us.

1:21:58.343 --> 1:22:02.013
Now onlyt women.
We lost one.

1:22:04.098 --> 1:22:05.975
My dad took me
around the corner.

1:22:19.739 --> 1:22:22.200
He made me hide over here.

1:22:24.369 --> 1:22:26.579
Okay, listen to me carefully.

1:22:26.663 --> 1:22:29.624
You and Mishka have gotta wait right here.
Right here, no matter what.

1:22:29.749 --> 1:22:31.584
It's gonna be all right.

1:22:31.709 --> 1:22:34.546
Wait right here.

1:22:37.465 --> 1:22:42.220
Hey, Russel!
Where you been?

1:22:42.345 --> 1:22:45.390
What's in the bag?
What's in the fucking bag?

1:22:45.473 --> 1:22:49.269
I could see my dad's face
when he tried to talk to them.

1:22:50.603 --> 1:22:52.438
The bag.

1:22:52.522 --> 1:22:55.900
There's nothing
in the fucking bag!

1:22:57.235 --> 1:22:59.529
Where is it?
Where is it, Russel?

1:23:00.947 --> 1:23:03.658
What's happening now?

1:23:03.783 --> 1:23:05.660
Where is it?

1:23:05.785 --> 1:23:07.745
Elisabeth?

1:23:07.829 --> 1:23:10.832
- I don't believe a fucking word!

1:23:13.585 --> 1:23:15.920
Elisabeth, what do you see?

1:23:16.004 --> 1:23:17.964
[ Koster]
Where is it?

1:23:18.089 --> 1:23:21.050
The one in the red coat kept on
kicking him and kicking him.

1:23:21.217 --> 1:23:25.638
They're asking him,” Where is it?
Where is it? Tell me where it is!"

1:23:25.722 --> 1:23:28.057
Let me up!
I'll tell you where it is!

1:23:28.141 --> 1:23:30.977
Elisabeth.

1:23:31.060 --> 1:23:34.147
Jesus. Help me up.

1:23:34.272 --> 1:23:37.483
Everybody was watching. They were just
watching, and no one would help.

1:23:37.609 --> 1:23:40.862
No one would help.
No one.

1:23:40.987 --> 1:23:45.325
Everybody was watching,
and no one would help!

1:23:54.751 --> 1:23:56.711
Elisabeth, what did the man want?

1:23:58.588 --> 1:24:00.590
- What did he want?
- I can almost reach him.

1:24:00.757 --> 1:24:02.717
Elisabeth!

1:24:03.927 --> 1:24:07.931
Daddy!
No! Daddy!

1:24:11.100 --> 1:24:13.520
Turn around!
Hands up!

1:24:17.899 --> 1:24:20.485
Down on your knees!
Now!

1:24:20.568 --> 1:24:22.820
What did the man want,
Elisabeth?

1:24:22.904 --> 1:24:25.740
Did he want a number?

1:24:27.534 --> 1:24:31.162
Elisabeth, I need to know
what the man wanted.

1:24:31.329 --> 1:24:33.915
He wants Mishka.
My doll.

1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:38.378
- Where is Mishka?
- Hang on to that. Okay, baby?

1:25:14.497 --> 1:25:17.041
- Yeah.
- Cutting it rather close.

1:25:17.166 --> 1:25:19.544
All right.
I have what you want.

1:25:19.627 --> 1:25:22.297
Good.
I'm listening.

1:25:22.422 --> 1:25:25.300
I've decided--

1:25:25.425 --> 1:25:27.677
- I've decided I'm gonna deliver the
number to you in person. - No time.

1:25:29.470 --> 1:25:31.931
- No choice.
- You're being brave again, Nathan.

1:25:32.056 --> 1:25:35.268
That's the best way
to get your daughter killed.

1:25:35.393 --> 1:25:39.272
Other than missing the deadline,
which is less than three minutes away.

1:25:39.397 --> 1:25:42.108
Rule number one:
No more clock.

1:25:42.192 --> 1:25:44.444
- What?
- You heard me.

1:25:44.569 --> 1:25:48.448
- I'll meet you there.
- Where?

1:25:48.573 --> 1:25:53.036
I think that you know where. Rule number two:
I want to speak to my daughter now.

1:25:54.787 --> 1:25:57.498
Do you hear me? I want
to speak to my daughter now!

1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:04.422
- Daddy?
- Pumpkin, you all right?

1:26:04.506 --> 1:26:07.008
Yeah. Daddy,
please come get me now.

1:26:07.133 --> 1:26:10.094
I'm on my way,
sweetheart.

1:26:12.305 --> 1:26:14.974
- Anything else?
- Rule number three:

1:26:15.099 --> 1:26:16.726
No more phone.

1:26:24.984 --> 1:26:28.947
Buddy! I've got a medical emergency.
I'll get this back to you.

1:26:29.030 --> 1:26:31.533
- I'll get it back to you.

1:27:03.439 --> 1:27:06.651
- Aggie?
- Is she alive?

1:27:06.776 --> 1:27:09.404
- She's fine.
- Where is she?

1:27:09.529 --> 1:27:14.409
Aggie, listen tome--
What is that?

1:27:14.534 --> 1:27:18.913
Did you call the police?
Aggie? Aggie?

1:27:19.038 --> 1:27:22.250
No. But somebody did.

1:27:22.375 --> 1:27:24.210
Do they know
what's going on?

1:27:24.335 --> 1:27:26.129
Not yet.

1:27:26.212 --> 1:27:29.549
- Listen.
- I'm here.

1:27:29.632 --> 1:27:31.509
Just get her back.

1:29:06.479 --> 1:29:08.565
Hey, fella!
What are you doin' down there?

1:29:08.648 --> 1:29:11.067
That's my boat.
Where you goin'? Hey!

1:29:11.150 --> 1:29:13.278
- Hey, asshole!
- That's my boat!

1:31:10.228 --> 1:31:13.398
Dr. Conrad.

1:31:15.525 --> 1:31:17.861
You're a committed man.

1:31:20.864 --> 1:31:23.074
I wanna see her.

1:31:24.742 --> 1:31:26.995
I want to see her now.

1:31:28.413 --> 1:31:30.665
Grim place
for a holiday, isn't it?

1:31:36.004 --> 1:31:38.173
Hello, Elisabeth.

1:31:40.341 --> 1:31:44.637
I thought about you every day for the last
ten years. Bet you thought about me too.

1:31:47.807 --> 1:31:51.269
I know you've been through a lot.
So have I.

1:31:54.022 --> 1:31:55.982
Your father
let us both down.

1:32:00.737 --> 1:32:03.698
- Where's my daughter? - You brought her
here because she hasn't given it to you.

1:32:03.823 --> 1:32:05.867
- Where are you keeping her?
- She won't give it to you.

1:32:05.992 --> 1:32:07.952
- I want to see Jessie now.
- Where is my number?

1:32:08.036 --> 1:32:10.205
You're not getting anything
until I see--

1:32:12.665 --> 1:32:16.127
We talked about
bravery today.

1:32:21.007 --> 1:32:22.634
It's not good.

1:32:26.679 --> 1:32:28.848
You need to know how
to use these.

1:32:35.480 --> 1:32:38.149
I wanna see my daughter.

1:32:39.776 --> 1:32:41.986
I think you've earned it.

1:32:42.070 --> 1:32:44.822
- Max!
- Daddy?

1:32:44.906 --> 1:32:47.450
Jessie?

1:32:47.575 --> 1:32:50.370
- Daddy!
- Jessie! It's all right, honey.

1:32:50.495 --> 1:32:52.956
You're gonna be fine.
It's gonna be all right.

1:32:54.499 --> 1:32:57.210
You guessed the number
is a grave. Very good.

1:32:57.293 --> 1:32:59.170
Now what?

1:33:00.839 --> 1:33:02.715
I finish my job.

1:33:10.473 --> 1:33:12.350
Come on, Nathan.
Up the stairs.

1:33:30.869 --> 1:33:33.371
Over there,
by the table.

1:33:33.496 --> 1:33:36.291
And Elisabeth.
Not her.

1:33:36.416 --> 1:33:39.210
Take her back outside.

1:33:39.294 --> 1:33:41.713
- Daddy?
- Jessie.

1:33:41.796 --> 1:33:44.257
You're gonna be
all right, honey.

1:33:44.382 --> 1:33:46.593
You're gonna be all right.

1:33:46.718 --> 1:33:49.429
Now. Let's see what
200 an hour can do.

1:34:06.154 --> 1:34:10.658
Officer Peterson, nice work.
You found my car. Where is it?

1:34:10.783 --> 1:34:12.994
It's over there.

1:34:13.119 --> 1:34:15.121
- Okay. Where's my guy?
- Well...

1:34:15.246 --> 1:34:17.457
he smashed through a steel fence
on the corrections pier,

1:34:17.582 --> 1:34:20.001
then he jacked a boat
from that individual.

1:34:20.126 --> 1:34:21.920
- A boat?
- Yeah. He and some girl.

1:34:22.003 --> 1:34:25.465
- Sounds a little hinky, huh?
- A boat to where?

1:34:25.590 --> 1:34:29.427
- That's the Coast Guard's problem.
- It is not.

1:34:29.552 --> 1:34:33.431
It is my problem. It is your problem.
What is over there?

1:34:41.940 --> 1:34:45.318
- Where's the music
coming from, Elisabeth?
- The radio.

1:34:45.443 --> 1:34:47.320
- The radio?

1:34:48.863 --> 1:34:52.158
- Where?
- It's playing on the boat.

1:34:55.370 --> 1:34:58.122
On the boat that brought you
here the first time?

1:34:58.206 --> 1:35:00.124
Yeah.

1:35:02.001 --> 1:35:04.671
It was cold.
I was wet.

1:35:04.838 --> 1:35:08.925
- My eyes were burning.

1:35:09.008 --> 1:35:11.511
But I was with my dad.

1:35:11.678 --> 1:35:14.305
How did you know
which one was your dad?

1:35:15.390 --> 1:35:18.142
They gave him a number.

1:35:19.561 --> 1:35:22.689
Where was this number?

1:35:25.149 --> 1:35:27.402
It was on his box.

1:35:27.527 --> 1:35:31.322
They carved the number
on top of his box.

1:35:35.118 --> 1:35:37.078
I tried to get it open,
but my fingers were numb.

1:35:39.539 --> 1:35:41.416
And I couldn't lift it.
It was too heavy.

1:35:42.792 --> 1:35:44.836
I couldn't put Mishka
inside.

1:35:46.462 --> 1:35:49.299
You better pray
she's lying, Nathan.

1:35:49.382 --> 1:35:53.636
Where did Mishka go?
What happened to Mishka?

1:35:53.720 --> 1:35:57.182
They saw--
They saw me.

1:35:57.265 --> 1:35:59.976
- Who saw you?
- The men.

1:36:00.059 --> 1:36:02.103
The men with the music.

1:36:02.228 --> 1:36:05.273
They were working.
They said my lips were blue.

1:36:05.398 --> 1:36:07.400
And they gave me a blanket.

1:36:10.570 --> 1:36:13.114
I told them my dad's inside,

1:36:13.239 --> 1:36:17.577
and I need to put her inside
with him.

1:36:17.660 --> 1:36:20.121
I needed to put Mishka in the box.

1:36:20.246 --> 1:36:22.373
I told them.

1:36:27.128 --> 1:36:30.006
What did they do?

1:36:34.469 --> 1:36:37.388
They helped me.

1:36:37.472 --> 1:36:39.891
They--

1:36:44.270 --> 1:36:46.022
They...

1:36:46.147 --> 1:36:49.150
helped me put Mishka...

1:36:49.275 --> 1:36:51.319
inside the box with him.

1:36:51.444 --> 1:36:53.488
They let me stay with him...

1:36:55.949 --> 1:36:58.576
until--

1:36:58.660 --> 1:37:01.371
until--

1:37:12.966 --> 1:37:14.926
Until--

1:37:15.051 --> 1:37:17.929
Until--

1:37:44.163 --> 1:37:46.666
So what do you think's gonna
happen when you dig this up?

1:37:46.791 --> 1:37:50.336
He's gonna have you kill me
and my little girl.

1:37:50.503 --> 1:37:52.463
You like her.
I can tell that.

1:37:54.340 --> 1:37:58.803
When you're done with us,
he'll be done with you.

1:37:58.928 --> 1:38:01.139
Just
keep walking.

1:38:51.773 --> 1:38:56.027
This boat's for charter, not runnin'
around the goddamn Sound on Thanks giving.

1:38:56.152 --> 1:38:58.238
Like I said, sir,
it's police business.

1:38:58.404 --> 1:39:00.990
Now do me a favor, Captain Bligh.
Just drive the friggin' boat.

1:39:21.427 --> 1:39:24.514
Go on, Max.
Open it up.

1:39:50.999 --> 1:39:52.750
Get her out!

1:39:52.834 --> 1:39:54.919
The girl, out!

1:39:54.919 --> 1:39:55.795
The girl, out!

1:39:55.920 --> 1:39:58.464
Sit down. Sit down!

1:39:58.590 --> 1:40:01.551
Daddy! Let me go!

1:40:03.136 --> 1:40:06.139
I am going to put
a bullet through your knee.

1:40:06.222 --> 1:40:08.433
Then you'll give me
the right number.

1:40:08.558 --> 1:40:10.476
No!

1:40:18.610 --> 1:40:20.987
No! Get off!

1:40:23.990 --> 1:40:26.034
Get her off!

1:40:26.159 --> 1:40:28.369
Sit down!

1:40:28.494 --> 1:40:32.207
I'll kill you! Forget the fucking number.
Just say hi to your dad from me.

1:40:32.290 --> 1:40:33.917
- She gave it to you!
- She gave me nothing.

1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:36.336
- She reversed it!
- She gave me nothing! Shut up!

1:40:36.503 --> 1:40:39.255
- She reversed the image in her mind!
- You lying bitch!

1:40:39.380 --> 1:40:41.633
Cognitive distortion.

1:40:41.758 --> 1:40:45.303
She wrote it right to left.

1:40:45.428 --> 1:40:47.639
Look. Look.

1:40:50.225 --> 1:40:52.769
She sees it in a mirror.

1:41:03.530 --> 1:41:07.534
Can you imagine what will
happen if this is bullshit?

1:41:18.086 --> 1:41:21.339
Central, this is Detective Cassidy
from Manhattan South Homicide.

1:41:21.464 --> 1:41:24.259
Shots fired on the northeast
shore of Hart Island.

1:41:24.384 --> 1:41:27.053
I'm en route and I need
harbor and aviation.

1:42:23.776 --> 1:42:26.779
Ten years of my life...

1:42:26.863 --> 1:42:29.073
bought and fucking paid for.

1:42:37.665 --> 1:42:39.876
Take care of that.

1:42:55.475 --> 1:42:56.768
Whoa, whoa.

1:42:56.851 --> 1:42:59.604
I'll kill you!

1:43:27.423 --> 1:43:28.925
Oh!

1:43:50.154 --> 1:43:52.282
Agh!

1:44:25.023 --> 1:44:27.692
You're not like me,
Nathan.

1:44:27.775 --> 1:44:30.320
I would have killed the man
who took my little girl.

1:44:33.031 --> 1:44:35.658
Police! Don't move!

1:44:38.870 --> 1:44:43.291
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon!

1:44:43.416 --> 1:44:45.335
Go on.

1:45:17.450 --> 1:45:19.285
I never got your name.

1:45:22.080 --> 1:45:24.207
Patrick.

1:45:24.290 --> 1:45:26.042
Patrick.

1:45:27.752 --> 1:45:31.923
Are you sure...
I'm not like you?

1:45:35.510 --> 1:45:38.930
- Are you sure?

1:45:48.314 --> 1:45:51.484
Was this really worth it?

1:45:51.609 --> 1:45:53.820
What?

1:45:55.488 --> 1:45:57.740
Your life.

1:45:57.824 --> 1:45:59.492
Absolutely.

1:46:01.452 --> 1:46:03.079
It's mine.

1:46:06.791 --> 1:46:08.668
Then, you go get it.

1:46:11.337 --> 1:46:13.840
Get it!

1:48:27.682 --> 1:48:30.602
I'll be right back,
sweetie.

1:48:36.816 --> 1:48:39.736
- How you holdin' up?
- I've been better.

1:48:43.323 --> 1:48:45.283
Thank you.

1:49:17.815 --> 1:49:20.151
Let's go.
Come on.
