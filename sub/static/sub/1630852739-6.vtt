<i>Bob Guccione, he's got the tape.</i>

00:13.013 --> 00:15.140
All I know is
we're suing the shit out of him.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.349
Suing him for what?

00:16.433 --> 00:19.477
- He'd do anything to stick it to Hef.
- Tommy's absolutely right.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.187
If he's not planning to do anything
and we sue

00:21.271 --> 00:23.440
he can suddenly decide to do it
to get back at us.

00:23.440 --> 00:27.152
Nobody's robbing Bob Guccione
of his God-given right

00:27.152 --> 00:28.987
to free expression.

00:28.987 --> 00:31.781
It was the right move. He was gonna
do it whether we sued or not.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.284
Don't. Just shut up, shut up, shut up!

00:34.284 --> 00:37.620
<i>Counsel for defendants will take
the deposition of Pamela Anderson Lee.</i>

00:37.704 --> 00:39.414
What? Why is it just me?

00:39.414 --> 00:41.041
I don't know why they need to talk
to either of us.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.333
We're the fucking plaintiffs.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.669
Doesn't matter. We're in this together.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.700
<i>Babe,
it's a fucking football game.</i>

01:15.784 --> 01:17.786
Okay. One second.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.999
- All right. I'm not missing kickoff.
- Okay, okay I'm coming.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.209
Wait. Wait.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.296
Oh! Hang on. Have you seen my jacket?

01:28.296 --> 01:30.298
- No. Let's go.
- Are you sure?

01:30.298 --> 01:31.466
Yes.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.593
- Let's go.
- I'm coming. Got it.

01:43.812 --> 01:44.854
Hut!

01:47.690 --> 01:48.691
Big Red!

01:51.820 --> 01:53.780
- I'm good.
- Two.

01:54.739 --> 01:56.741
- You might change your mind, babe.
- Okay.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.454
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

02:01.538 --> 02:04.082
<i>let's see if this Labatt's cam
can find us</i>

02:04.082 --> 02:06.417
<i>a gorgeous Labatt's fan!</i>

02:33.820 --> 02:34.863
I'm sorry. Um...

02:36.406 --> 02:37.866
Could you repeat the question?

02:39.033 --> 02:42.162
Mrs. Lee, do you recall how old you were

02:42.162 --> 02:46.541
the first time
you publicly exposed your genitals?

02:52.172 --> 02:54.591
Objection.
- What's your objection, Sandy?

02:54.591 --> 02:55.675
Relevance.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.970
What kind of a question is that?

02:58.970 --> 03:00.388
A disgusting one.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.350
So, he can just ask me anything he wants
and I have to answer?

03:04.434 --> 03:06.019
In deposition, yes.
Once we get to trial,

03:06.019 --> 03:07.645
the judge won't allow any of this crap.

03:07.729 --> 03:11.149
Just don't let them rattle you.
Calmer you stay, sooner we're done.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.902
Come on, Sandy.
Request a conference if you need one.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.195
So,

03:15.945 --> 03:18.740
smile and tell him
to fuck off in my head?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.658
Mmm. Precisely.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.452
Carry on.

03:22.577 --> 03:25.288
All right, Mrs. Lee,
let's start with something similar.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.708
Do you remember
when you first started modeling?

03:31.586 --> 03:33.296
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
for your half-time...</i>

03:33.296 --> 03:35.590
Hi. Hi. Yeah, you. Hi.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.718
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.678
Uh, I saw you on the jumbotron.

03:40.762 --> 03:41.763
Oh!

03:41.763 --> 03:43.473
- Yeah, it's crazy.
- Yeah.

03:43.890 --> 03:47.435
Oh, uh, my name's Roger Dennis.
I'm, uh, VP of Marketing at Labatt.

03:47.435 --> 03:48.561
Um, what, what's your name?

03:49.020 --> 03:50.521
Oh, I'm, I'm Pamela.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.775
Pamela. I realize
this is, kind of, out of the blue,

03:53.775 --> 03:56.819
but have you ever done any modeling?

03:57.070 --> 03:58.571
Modeling?

03:58.655 --> 03:59.989
- Yeah, I--
- Move along, bro.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.952
Oh, uh, we're always looking
for fresh faces.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.036
Cool.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.580
Um, hey, this guy's from Labatt's.

04:07.997 --> 04:08.998
Mmm.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.083
Got a card, buddy?

04:10.792 --> 04:11.793
Oh, yeah.

04:14.003 --> 04:17.173
Uh, think it over. If you decide
you're interested, give me a call.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.509
- Easy, pal.
- Thank you. Thanks.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.643
Got to give him credit.
One of the more creative attempts.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.895
- Why? At what?
- To get in your pants.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.563
Oh, my God. What...

04:33.982 --> 04:34.983
That's mine.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.491
Alice, can you cover for me?

04:43.908 --> 04:44.909
Pucker up.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.791
Thank you.
Yes, sir.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.105
<i>Labatt Marketing.</i>

05:34.334 --> 05:36.169
Babe!
What?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.546
- Can you get that?
- Yes.

05:38.838 --> 05:39.839
- Pam!
- What?

05:39.839 --> 05:41.174
- Get the phone!
- Oh!

05:41.174 --> 05:42.258
Hello?

05:44.135 --> 05:46.429
I'm sorry. Wait. Yeah, this is me.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.559
What?

05:52.101 --> 05:53.936
Sorry. For real?

05:54.020 --> 05:55.229
No, this isn't a joke?

05:59.233 --> 06:00.234
Oh, my God.

06:00.818 --> 06:01.986
Wow.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.113
I can't believe you even saw that.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.198
Who is that?

06:05.198 --> 06:07.283
Um, yeah, no. Um...

06:07.367 --> 06:10.411
Yeah, a little bit.
Just some local stuff.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.663
Babe, who is that?

06:13.956 --> 06:15.500
Oh, my God. This is...

06:15.500 --> 06:18.795
I'm sorry. No. I just have to ask again.
This isn't like, a prank?

06:23.758 --> 06:25.676
Oh, my God. Wow. Thank you.

06:26.552 --> 06:27.595
Talk soon.

06:28.304 --> 06:29.514
Who the fuck was that?

06:31.516 --> 06:33.434
That was <i>Playboy.</i>

06:35.853 --> 06:38.064
- What?
- They want me to do some test shots.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.649
<i>- Playboy?</i> You?
- Yeah.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.777
They want me to come over, yeah.
This is crazy, right?

06:42.777 --> 06:44.195
Yeah, it's fucking crazy.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.363
It's fucking crazy.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.989
Call them back
and tell them you're not doing it.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.492
- What?
- Call back. You're not doing it.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.160
What? No, it's just a test shoot.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.328
I don't give a fuck what it is.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.663
Why are you being like this?

06:53.663 --> 06:55.998
Why am I being like this? Maybe because
I don't want my girlfriend's tits

06:56.082 --> 06:57.625
to be all over the fucking world!

06:57.625 --> 06:59.752
This is for me! This isn't for you!

06:59.836 --> 07:01.754
- Are you kidding me? Why am I--
- Oh, my God.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.798
You know what,
I'm not talking about this anymore.

07:03.798 --> 07:04.924
This conversation is over.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.968
- Yeah, you're gonna walk away?
- Yeah, I'm gonna walk away.

07:15.643 --> 07:16.727
Fuck.

07:24.318 --> 07:26.404
Where the fuck are you going, Pam?

07:28.739 --> 07:29.782
America.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.125
Mrs. Lee, if you're
having trouble remembering,

07:39.125 --> 07:40.668
<i>perhaps I can... Objection.</i>

07:40.668 --> 07:43.087
<i>To the inference
that my client possess a faulty memory.</i>

07:43.171 --> 07:46.090
Please let the record state
the defense has not been permitted one

07:46.174 --> 07:48.134
clarifying follow-up question
of the deponent

07:48.134 --> 07:49.552
without objection
from the plaintiff's counsel.

07:49.552 --> 07:52.305
Oh, for the love...
I will continue to object

07:52.305 --> 07:54.182
until you comport yourself
in a manner...

07:54.182 --> 07:56.893
You know what? Off the record.
Don't be a schmuck, Bruce.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.687
Off the record.
Then stop with the theatrics, Sandy.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.732
I'm gonna get some tea.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.401
No, no, no, no, no. We'll get it.

08:05.776 --> 08:08.488
Tea. Now.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.948
- Cream? Sugar?
- Just black. Thanks.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.575
Shall we resume?

08:13.034 --> 08:15.119
- Yeah.
- You told us you met your husband,

08:15.203 --> 08:18.372
Thomas Lee Bass,
on or around December 31, 1994?

08:18.998 --> 08:20.041
That's correct.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.251
And what were
the circumstances of that meeting?

08:22.752 --> 08:25.588
I was socializing with friends.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.173
And where were you socializing?

08:27.173 --> 08:28.633
At a club in Los Angeles.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.761
Did you know anything at all
about Mr. Lee before you met?

08:31.761 --> 08:34.847
Like everyone in America, I knew
he was the drummer for Mötley Crüe.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.724
And when Mr. Lee approached you
at the club,

08:36.724 --> 08:38.601
did you find him attractive?

08:38.601 --> 08:40.645
I liked his smile.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.647
I still do. Thank you.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.315
Were you aware of his reputation

08:44.315 --> 08:46.776
as someone who engaged
to the services of prostitutes?

08:47.860 --> 08:49.946
Tommy didn't pay women for sex.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.823
So he never had
sexual relations with prostitutes?

08:52.907 --> 08:56.827
Well, a prostitute, by definition,
is somebody who gets paid for sex,

08:56.911 --> 08:58.246
so, I'm not sure if that works.

09:00.665 --> 09:01.958
- Mrs. Lee.
- Yes?

09:02.625 --> 09:04.835
Have you ever been paid for sex?

09:11.717 --> 09:12.760
No.

09:14.512 --> 09:18.558
Do you need a moment
to reflect on that question?

09:19.308 --> 09:21.561
That's something I would remember.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.898
So you've never received money
for performing a sex act?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.777
- No.
- Objection. Asked, and answered.

09:29.777 --> 09:32.822
Would that mean, you don't consider
posing naked for a camera

09:32.822 --> 09:33.990
to be a sex act?

09:34.490 --> 09:36.242
Oh, my God.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.662
I do not.

09:49.088 --> 09:51.549
Welcome to the Playboy Mansion,
Ms. Anderson.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.806
Oh, it looks like a castle.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.141
Hey, thanks, Nelson.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.392
Have a great shoot.

10:07.982 --> 10:08.983
See?

10:18.451 --> 10:19.827
I can't believe this.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.338
You see what I'm saying?

10:33.341 --> 10:34.425
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.344
How's it going?
I'm Pamela Denise Anderson.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.763
- I have that... This is my mom.
- Yeah. I'm Carol.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.307
Thank you.

10:52.109 --> 10:54.945
- They gave us champagne.
- Oh, wow.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.698
Oh, my God. Honey.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.577
Look at you.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.331
Oh, Mom.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.334
- What?
- Oh!

11:08.334 --> 11:09.502
- It's okay.
- Mom.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.380
Pammy, look, you look like
a magazine model.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.881
You look...

11:13.881 --> 11:15.132
Oh, my God.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.343
You look like Marilyn Monroe.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.011
- No, I don't.
- Yes.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.224
Okay.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.519
Drink a little champagne.

11:27.436 --> 11:28.938
You look beautiful.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.815
You look absolutely beautiful.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.192
Yeah, I do.

11:33.734 --> 11:34.944
All right, love?

11:35.611 --> 11:38.322
I'm Simon,
and I'm gonna be taking your picture.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.282
- Hi, Simon.
- Hi.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.409
Come with me.

11:48.582 --> 11:51.836
Sorry. Can I just take one moment?

11:51.836 --> 11:52.920
Of course.

12:09.311 --> 12:10.312
Hey.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.441
All right.

12:13.441 --> 12:17.194
Is there anything I need to know?
Angles to avoid, bad side?

12:17.278 --> 12:19.238
Actually, I don't think
you have a bad side.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.406
Um...

12:20.406 --> 12:21.532
So, uh...

12:22.992 --> 12:25.411
What exactly
are we shooting?

12:25.411 --> 12:27.747
Well, I thought we'd start over here,
by the window,

12:27.747 --> 12:29.874
- you looking out, gauzy curtains.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.792
And we'd, uh,
pop you down on the balcony,

12:31.876 --> 12:33.961
do sort of a "stretchy greeting

12:33.961 --> 12:36.422
- "to the morning sun" type, you know?
- Okay.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.883
- But I mean, which parts?
- Parts?

12:43.637 --> 12:44.889
Never fear, dear.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.683
This is <i>Playboy,</i> not <i>Penthouse.</i>
We like to keep things classy here.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.227
Oh, yeah. Totally.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.980
- So...
- Yes.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.567
- Remember to have fun.
- Okay.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.112
And make love to the camera.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.238
That's it.

13:01.530 --> 13:04.492
Oh, totally gorgeous. Exactly.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.870
Oh, yes. You're like a ray of sunshine,

13:07.870 --> 13:08.996
you are.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.666
Try and find your light
on your right cheek in the window.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.960
- In the window?
- Keep looking at me. That's it.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.341
Would you care to, uh, lose a bit
of the blouse? Completely up to you,

13:20.341 --> 13:23.010
whatever you feel comfortable with.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.762
Sure.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.138
Great.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.141
That's it.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.852
Look at you.
How long have you been hiding that?

13:32.394 --> 13:35.773
Total natural. Wow, look at you, Pamela.

13:36.565 --> 13:37.566
Yeah.

13:38.609 --> 13:39.693
Forest nymph.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.447
That's it.
You sure you haven't done this before?

13:44.448 --> 13:47.117
Absolutely top marks.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.878
Well done, love.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.006
What? That's it?

14:01.090 --> 14:03.551
Ladies and gentlemen,
Pamela Anderson!

14:09.723 --> 14:10.975
Well done, love.

14:12.643 --> 14:15.062
- The lady of the hour.
- Hi.

14:16.063 --> 14:18.691
- Did you have fun today?
- Sure did.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.276
I felt like Alice in Wonderland.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.361
Good. Let me get us a drink.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.747
To the good life. To your good life.

14:35.332 --> 14:36.375
Cheers.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.587
Please, join me.

14:44.300 --> 14:48.304
This is gonna sound like
I'm giving you a line, but I'm not.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.597
Women like you, Pam,

14:50.931 --> 14:53.309
they come around once in a generation.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.518
Oh, God.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.520
- I don't know about that.
- Well, I do.

14:56.604 --> 14:59.940
I'm not saying that to be nice,
I'm saying that because it's true.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.358
You are special.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.111
Well, I certainly feel

15:04.111 --> 15:05.321
- special right now.
- Good.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.990
You should get used to that.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.200
The sooner you do,
the happier you'll be.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.663
Could I be so bold as to offer
some advice?

15:15.247 --> 15:17.124
You already are.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.878
People will pay you
to be the Pamela that they want.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.380
The tabloids, the studios.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.007
Even me.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.343
But that number, that dollar figure

15:27.343 --> 15:30.137
will never represent what you are worth.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.891
Are you saying you got a deal?

15:33.891 --> 15:35.768
- I should ask for more.
- Always.

15:37.186 --> 15:40.898
Don't forget,
separate your price from your worth.

15:40.898 --> 15:44.693
You do that, and you can be
any version of Pam you need to be.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.362
And remember who you are.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.697
Well, Mr. Hefner,

15:50.074 --> 15:52.201
women have been doing that
for centuries.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.079
Playing parts is nothing new.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.122
True.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.584
But you're not in Ladysmith,
Canada, anymore.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.254
Now, it's the whole world
that will be watching.

16:10.260 --> 16:13.555
Such a pleasure to be in your company.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.101
You are always welcome at the Mansion.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.188
You know, I might just take you
up on that.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.773
I look forward to it.

16:33.409 --> 16:37.162
So, I saw a bunch of the girls
in the Mansion today,

16:37.955 --> 16:41.667
and the one thing I noticed
was that they all have...

16:44.753 --> 16:46.255
Okay.

16:46.255 --> 16:49.925
And I just, you know, the shoot seemed
to go good and everything.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.969
You know, if I do more, just...

16:52.928 --> 16:54.722
I mean, nothing major, just like,

16:55.723 --> 16:57.516
a cup size, two at most.

16:57.516 --> 17:01.478
You know, like your boobs, Mom.
You got the best boobs.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.274
Your father never complained.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.903
- So what do you think?
- What do I think?

17:09.987 --> 17:10.988
Yeah.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.826
I think God made you perfect
just the way you are.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.248
But if you want to try and top him...

17:25.461 --> 17:27.796
Get out of here.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.214
- No, honey.
- Really?

17:29.298 --> 17:30.883
Yeah, sure.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.469
I mean, whatever you want.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.056
Just turn off the light, please.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.683
I'm so tired.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.367
Is it gonna be okay?

18:01.121 --> 18:02.498
Is what gonna be?

18:03.540 --> 18:04.583
You know...

18:08.045 --> 18:09.088
Everything.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.507
Oh, honey...

18:13.967 --> 18:16.011
It's going to be wonderful.

18:30.275 --> 18:33.195
Did you pose
for the magazine again?

18:33.195 --> 18:35.322
- I did, yes.
- When was that?

18:37.199 --> 18:39.868
October '89, February '91,

18:40.911 --> 18:43.122
July '92, August '93,

18:43.122 --> 18:45.874
November '94, and January of this year.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.169
- They clearly like you.
- And I them.

18:49.628 --> 18:52.548
On that, you have, in interviews,

18:52.548 --> 18:56.218
described your relationship with
Hugh Hefner as "Like a father to me."

18:56.218 --> 19:00.430
And that you are "Very close.
I consider him a great friend."

19:00.514 --> 19:03.016
- Do you concur with these statements?
- I do, yes.

19:04.601 --> 19:07.354
Do you know who Bob Guccione is?

19:07.354 --> 19:08.605
Something funny, Mrs. Lee?

19:09.857 --> 19:10.858
Not at all.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.943
Then could you answer
my question, please?

19:14.111 --> 19:18.282
<i>Bob Guccione is the founder
and publisher of</i> Penthouse <i>magazine.</i>

19:20.033 --> 19:22.452
As a "Close friend of Mister Hefner's,"

19:22.536 --> 19:25.539
you must be aware of
Mr. Guccione and Mr. Hefner's

19:25.539 --> 19:29.835
strong mutual dislike
of one another, hmm?

19:29.835 --> 19:31.712
Yes, I am.

19:31.712 --> 19:35.132
If Mr. Hefner discovered that you
had engaged in a business transaction

19:35.132 --> 19:38.927
with Mr. Guccione, he'd probably
regard that as a betrayal, no?

19:39.011 --> 19:40.596
- Probably, yes.
- So, therefore,

19:40.596 --> 19:42.806
if you wanted to expose yourself,

19:42.890 --> 19:43.891
no pun intended,

19:43.891 --> 19:48.103
to <i>Penthouse's</i> readers
without jeopardizing your good standing

19:48.187 --> 19:51.523
at <i>Playboy,</i> one way to do so, would be
to slip your materials to Mr. Guccione,

19:51.607 --> 19:53.108
say, under the guise of a leaked tape.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.818
I wouldn't do something like that.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.571
Well, isn't it true that
for the past three <i>Playboy</i> covers,

19:57.571 --> 20:00.240
you have received a near
negligible increase in compensation?

20:00.324 --> 20:01.325
No.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.826
No, you haven't received
a near-negligible increase

20:02.910 --> 20:03.911
in compensation?

20:03.911 --> 20:06.413
<i>No. Mr. Hefner and I,
we've, we've negotiated...</i>

20:06.997 --> 20:09.249
<i>Before each shoot,
a mutually-agreed-upon figure</i>

20:09.333 --> 20:10.375
<i>we're both happy with.</i>

20:10.459 --> 20:12.920
Can you think of any financial benefits

20:12.920 --> 20:15.088
that you might stand
to reap from <i>Penthouse</i>

20:15.172 --> 20:19.635
being given a copy of a tape containing
pornographic images of yourself?

20:19.635 --> 20:22.012
- None whatsoever.
- Then perhaps you can provide a reason

20:22.012 --> 20:25.182
as to why you and Mr. Lee
would make a pornographic tape

20:25.974 --> 20:29.728
if it wasn't like all of your other
pornographic activities,

20:29.728 --> 20:31.230
for the purpose of financial gain?

20:32.981 --> 20:35.692
- Wait, have we got everything?
- Oh, we got it all, baby.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.361
- Yeah, we do.
- Yeah.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.281
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:42.783 --> 20:43.825
Let's go.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.369
Ah!

20:45.661 --> 20:46.870
Yes!

20:48.163 --> 20:50.582
No.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.335
Say hello, Mrs. Lee.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.087
<i>Hello, Mrs. Lee.</i>

20:56.255 --> 20:58.507
Where are we heading, Mrs. Lee?

20:58.507 --> 20:59.591
Heaven.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.223
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.141
I love you so much.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.772
<i>It's gonna be the best week
of our lives.</i>

21:17.567 --> 21:18.735
Then what's that for?

21:18.819 --> 21:21.071
We need your testimony
to verify the identity

21:21.071 --> 21:24.074
of the individuals
represented on your tape, as well as

21:24.074 --> 21:26.785
provide context for certain sections.

21:26.785 --> 21:29.788
I'm sorry. What? What...
You want me to watch the tape?

21:30.122 --> 21:31.164
Just a few parts.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.417
Oh, my God. No.

21:33.417 --> 21:37.129
I am so sorry, Pam.
You can't be serious.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.298
You know, she could tell you
who's on the tape.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.924
You don't have to watch
the whole damn thing.

21:45.929 --> 21:47.389
<i>Hey, baby. Hey.</i>

21:47.389 --> 21:49.266
<i>Is this for me?
Yeah.</i>

21:49.474 --> 21:54.021
Can you confirm who
the two individuals are on this clip?

21:56.273 --> 21:57.482
My husband and I.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.152
Uh, can you identify the road
on which it took place?

22:01.403 --> 22:03.613
Probably an hour outside Malibu.

22:04.114 --> 22:05.741
So, I-15 north. Does that sound right?

22:07.284 --> 22:08.952
- Yes.
- That's a major interstate.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.663
You notice other vehicles
while you were driving out?

22:12.039 --> 22:13.081
Yes.

22:13.498 --> 22:17.169
Were you at all concerned
that other motorists might be able to

22:18.420 --> 22:20.547
- see what you were doing?
- No.

22:20.547 --> 22:21.882
Why is that?

22:21.882 --> 22:23.508
Come on.

22:24.634 --> 22:25.719
I just wasn't.

22:25.719 --> 22:28.013
Well were you concerned about
the prospect of truck drivers

22:28.013 --> 22:30.515
with their elevated vantage point
being able to see

22:30.599 --> 22:34.394
into your vehicle, while you were
performing oral copulation on Mr. Lee?

22:36.605 --> 22:38.940
- No.
- Because you felt that it was unlikely

22:39.024 --> 22:42.402
that they would be able to do so,
or because you didn't care if they did?

22:42.486 --> 22:44.237
Objection.
Compound beyond scope.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.906
All right. Next clip.

22:47.240 --> 22:50.035
<i>Three. Three at least.</i>

22:50.660 --> 22:53.538
Five. Enough for their own band.

22:56.249 --> 22:57.793
I'm a bit spaced out.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.544
Mmm.

23:00.295 --> 23:01.797
But we won't spoil...

23:01.797 --> 23:05.008
We won't spoil them. No. Promise me.

23:05.092 --> 23:08.512
- No. I'm not spoiling...
- Mmm-mmm. No.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.555
...my kids.

23:10.639 --> 23:11.973
Except on Christmas.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.976
Only on Christmas. Okay. That's fine.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.020
And me. Spoil me on Christmas.

23:20.607 --> 23:21.983
And we'll come back here

23:23.318 --> 23:24.444
every year.

23:26.279 --> 23:29.741
- And rent a houseboat, tour the lake,
- Mmm-hmm.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.870
telling them where they were conceived.

23:33.995 --> 23:35.831
Shut up, Tommy. You ruined it.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.707
- Why? We have to.
- No.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.000
- We have to tell 'em.
- Mmm.

23:47.592 --> 23:48.885
I love you, Pam.

23:51.555 --> 23:52.806
And I love you.

24:04.359 --> 24:07.237
<i>Yeah.
Oh, my God.</i>

24:07.696 --> 24:10.490
<i>Oh, yeah, baby.
I love you so fucking much.</i>

24:10.866 --> 24:12.284
<i>Yeah, give it to me.
You made us fucking rich.</i>

24:12.284 --> 24:13.368
<i>I want those babies.</i>

24:13.452 --> 24:14.578
<i>-</i> PAM:<i>Give me.
- </i> <i>Yeah?</i>

24:14.578 --> 24:16.204
<i>Yeah.
You ready for one right now?</i>

24:16.288 --> 24:17.372
<i>Give it to me.</i>

24:17.456 --> 24:19.499
<i>Yeah, give it to me, baby. Fuck.</i>

24:23.128 --> 24:24.171
<i>Baby.</i>

24:28.008 --> 24:31.219
And can you confirm
who the two individuals

24:31.344 --> 24:32.804
on this clip are?

24:33.889 --> 24:35.557
- My husband and I.
- And where were you

24:35.557 --> 24:37.476
while engaging
in this sexual intercourse?

24:38.059 --> 24:39.436
I was on my boat.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.062
No. What body of water was it?

24:41.146 --> 24:44.316
As I said, we were
on Lake Mead, Arizona.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.110
While you were
engaged in sexual intercourse

24:47.194 --> 24:50.530
on the bow of your boat, were you aware
of the presence of any other boats?

24:50.614 --> 24:54.326
No, it was... That was...
That part of the lake was empty.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.370
Would it have been possible,
while engaged in sexual intercourse,

24:57.454 --> 24:59.956
for another boat to come into view?
No.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.208
We'd have heard a motor.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.627
But it would
have been possible, yes?

25:06.171 --> 25:08.882
I suppose so. Yes.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.886
Was that exciting to you both?

25:15.639 --> 25:16.640
No.

25:19.309 --> 25:22.103
All right, next clip.
- I just... I'm sorry.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.981
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.274
Please excuse me.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.762
Are you okay?

25:55.762 --> 25:56.846
Thanks.

26:01.017 --> 26:03.186
For what it's worth, I've seen a lot

26:03.270 --> 26:06.690
of horrible depositions, but this...

26:34.676 --> 26:36.136
<i>I want another.</i>

26:36.136 --> 26:37.596
<i>Another what?</i>

26:37.596 --> 26:38.680
<i>Vacation.</i>

26:40.181 --> 26:41.391
Vacation?

26:41.391 --> 26:43.893
- Yeah.
- We're not even unpacked.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.562
You know what? Let's go to Fiji.

26:46.730 --> 26:49.232
- Have you ever been?
- Never.

26:49.316 --> 26:52.444
Seriously. Hey, come on. I'm serious.
I'm serious. Come on.

26:53.236 --> 26:55.572
- Let's go to Fiji tonight.
- Oh, baby.

26:55.572 --> 26:58.867
I can't go to Fiji tonight.
I've got work.

26:58.867 --> 27:02.203
- Can't skip work and go to Fiji.
- Oh, my! Of course.

27:02.704 --> 27:03.705
Of course.

27:03.705 --> 27:04.956
Well, you're gonna have to...

27:05.457 --> 27:07.876
You're gonna have to skip it
'cause you're going

27:07.876 --> 27:11.463
on a first class to Fiji!

27:11.463 --> 27:14.215
- Look at this!
- What are you doing?

27:14.299 --> 27:15.300
Look at these.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.010
You're gonna wear all that. Everything.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.387
- In Fiji.
- There's a dinner every night in Fiji,

27:19.471 --> 27:20.597
- and you're gonna have to wear
- Yeah, it looks good.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.349
every single one of these dresses.

27:22.349 --> 27:26.019
And it gets cold at night,
so, you're gonna have to wear that hat.

27:28.063 --> 27:30.190
This hat is perfect for Fiji.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.942
It is. Look at my sweet wife.

27:33.026 --> 27:34.903
- Oh, my God.
- Baby.

27:34.903 --> 27:38.198
- Enough already with the camera.
- Oh, my God.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.533
- Give me that! Oh!
- Skinny ass.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.621
- Hey, one question.
- Give me that camera.

27:44.621 --> 27:46.998
Hold on, one question.
What was your favorite part of vacation?

27:47.082 --> 27:48.124
Being with you.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.417
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.252
I thought it was boning your husband.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.672
Give me that camera.
Hey!

27:53.672 --> 27:54.756
Give my camera.
- One second.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.466
We're dealing with something
very important.

27:56.466 --> 27:58.093
- What?
- This thing here, okay?

28:00.887 --> 28:03.723
Family artifact. Okay?

28:05.517 --> 28:06.559
- It quite
- Mmm-hmm.

28:08.228 --> 28:12.691
possibly contains
the conception of our first child.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.988
So, we got to treat it
with the reverence that it deserves.

28:19.989 --> 28:21.157
- Right?
- Yeah.

28:21.408 --> 28:23.493
- I'm gonna put it in the safe.
- Okay.

28:28.915 --> 28:31.376
But on my trip to the safe,
I'm really gonna miss you.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.919
I'm gonna miss you, too.

28:32.919 --> 28:35.630
- Okay? So...
- Shall I come with you?

28:35.714 --> 28:37.132
...don't leave.

28:37.132 --> 28:39.050
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.928
I'll be packing for Fiji.

28:52.105 --> 28:53.356
Thank you. Sure.

28:53.606 --> 28:55.233
Sorry about that.

28:58.862 --> 28:59.904
Welcome back, Mrs. Lee.

28:59.988 --> 29:02.157
I hope you're feeling better.

29:02.157 --> 29:04.659
I'd like to return to something
you said earlier.

29:05.118 --> 29:06.202
Isn't it true, Mrs. Lee,

29:06.286 --> 29:08.705
that the so-called
private correspondence...

29:08.705 --> 29:11.541
Sorry to cut you off, Bruce, 5:00 p.m.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.918
- 5:00 p.m. already?
- Yep.

29:14.002 --> 29:15.253
Ah, that went fast.

29:15.253 --> 29:18.006
Well, this, uh, concludes
our scheduled time for today.

29:18.006 --> 29:20.175
We still do have
a few more questions, though.

29:20.175 --> 29:23.720
So, I would propose that
we resume tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.099
I need to talk to you.

29:34.773 --> 29:35.857
I'm done.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.361
Pam, the worst is over.
We are this close...

29:40.445 --> 29:42.447
- No, you don't understand. I'm done.
- Pam...

29:42.447 --> 29:44.574
I will not answer another question.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.744
Pam, listen,
I'm trying to make this work...

29:47.744 --> 29:51.331
You make that happen,
or I get a new lawyer.

29:55.877 --> 29:56.961
Right. Uh...

29:57.045 --> 30:00.048
- Bruce, can I have a word with you?
- Of course.

31:03.570 --> 31:05.405
I'm sorry we left such a mess.
