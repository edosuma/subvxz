WEBVTT

00:00.645 --> 00:03.752
No, no, boys. You go clockwise!

00:04.059 --> 00:06.173
Clockwise! Can't you tell time?

00:06.282 --> 00:09.389
The other way, boys! They're not getting it, Miss Patty.

00:09.491 --> 00:11.503
Well, the wedding's tomorrow. We gotta get it.

00:11.597 --> 00:13.773
It's the Banyan boys. They won't do what I tell them.

00:13.860 --> 00:16.778
Nice maypole, Patty! Really organized!

00:16.890 --> 00:18.380
Oh, shut up, Kirk!

00:18.637 --> 00:22.255
- Tough day, Patty? 
- I've worked with Joan Crawford. This is worse.

00:22.344 --> 00:25.855
I don't call that a "maypole." I'd call that a "maybe-not pole."

00:25.974 --> 00:26.712
What's with him?

00:26.843 --> 00:29.358
He's mad because I made Chrissy my dance captain over him.

00:29.453 --> 00:32.650
- Kirk has forty-three jobs. 
- Would you go talk to him, please?

00:32.726 --> 00:35.148
- I got my hands full here. 
- The Banyan boys?

00:35.220 --> 00:38.375
Oh! Lucifer tired of them in hell and dumped them here.

00:38.471 --> 00:40.146
- I'll talk to Kirk. 
- Thank you.

00:40.443 --> 00:43.541
All right, Chrissy, let's give it another go!

00:44.145 --> 00:46.863
Hey, Kirk, maybe you want to ease up on Patty a little.

00:47.104 --> 00:49.351
But the maypole is an expertise of mine.

00:49.638 --> 00:53.668
I re-enacted the dwarf's maypole choreography from "The Safety Dance" video,

00:53.795 --> 00:56.719
my junior-high talent show. Chicks were falling at my feet.

00:56.965 --> 01:00.349
- I'm less than impressed, Patty! 
- Take a break, please.

01:00.421 --> 01:02.597
I've seen Miss Patty get violent. It's not pretty. Remember that time?

01:03.002 --> 01:04.041
That's when she beat me up.

01:04.446 --> 01:05.765
Yeah. Let's not repeat that.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074

02:22.382 --> 02:23.858
They're the best I've got.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.833
That's sad for you and the whole vegetable industry.

02:26.971 --> 02:29.245
They're the best in the state. I stand by them.

02:29.351 --> 02:33.402
- They're puny. They're tasteless. 
- Puny? These are not puny.

02:33.473 --> 02:36.366
If they're small enough to shove up our son's nose, they're too small!

02:36.453 --> 02:38.803
No way could you shove one of these up Davey's nose.

02:38.890 --> 02:40.505
- Bet you five bucks. 
- Get him in here!

02:40.984 --> 02:44.958
Hey, guys. You probably shouldn't shove a radish up your son's nose. Just thinking out loud.

02:45.286 --> 02:48.399
All right, I'll take these if it's all you've got.

02:48.550 --> 02:50.047
Don't do me any favors.

02:50.958 --> 02:52.505
You two are back big-time.

02:53.145 --> 02:56.012
That actually felt good. Like getting a Jack LaLanne workout.

02:56.637 --> 03:00.220
- Dead or alive? 
- Jack LaLanne? Dead. No -- alive.

03:00.825 --> 03:02.391
Oh, now that's gonna bug me.

03:02.800 --> 03:03.436
Hello?

03:03.611 --> 03:06.610
- There is so much joy around me, I'm gonna hurl. 
- Hey, what's wrong?

03:06.753 --> 03:09.949
You should see all the boisterous high-fiving going on all around me. It's sad.

03:10.050 --> 03:12.929
- It's just really sad. Hey, do you mind, buddy? 
- Kids are in party mode, huh?

03:13.010 --> 03:15.544
The kids are clicking their heels like there's no tomorrow.

03:15.622 --> 03:18.228
And there is no tomorrow for those who do not have a final

03:18.335 --> 03:20.410
on Saturday morning, such as me. I'm pathetic.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.159
I should stand between two of them and have them high-five my head

03:23.236 --> 03:25.197
from opposite sides and put me out of my misery.

03:25.302 --> 03:27.224
Just one more final to go, then you'll be free.

03:27.403 --> 03:30.230
Ahh, two more boisterous bozos just rubbing my face in it.

03:30.327 --> 03:33.757
You know, I do have one thing to run by you. Do you have the brain power?

03:33.835 --> 03:36.388
- I think I can swing it. 
- It involves the "J" word.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.487
Oh, not more about Jesus. I'm sick of him and Mel Gibson.

03:39.702 --> 03:40.332
Jess.

03:40.961 --> 03:42.939
- Oh, what about him? 
- He's in town for that wedding

03:43.070 --> 03:45.702
and I never know where we stand on the Jessometer. I've been seeing him.

03:45.798 --> 03:47.607
I was just wondering if you want me to tell you when I do.

03:47.704 --> 03:48.692
- Sure. 
- Really?

03:49.107 --> 03:50.130
- Why not? 
- Okay.

03:50.291 --> 03:54.079
It's just always so weird -- this "J"-word topic of ours.

03:54.197 --> 03:56.141
You don't have to refer to him as "the 'J' word."

03:56.245 --> 03:58.267
Call him "Jess," and feel free to tell me when you see him.

03:58.395 --> 04:01.277
I mean, if you see him eight times in one day,

04:01.455 --> 04:04.560
you don't need to call me eight different times to tell me. That's clearly overdose.

04:04.651 --> 04:05.123
Sure.

04:05.302 --> 04:08.420
Maybe, like, you could limit the reports to just significant sightings.

04:08.527 --> 04:10.729
If you see him a hundred yards away, disappearing around a corner,

04:10.796 --> 04:11.880
I really don't need to know that.

04:12.050 --> 04:14.394
If he comes up to you and spits in your face, report that.

04:14.553 --> 04:16.822
- Permission to spit back? 
- You know what I'm saying.

04:16.954 --> 04:19.120
I know what you're saying. Hey, you know what I should do?

04:19.326 --> 04:22.583
Run up, tell him I love him, then run away really fast -- a taste of his own medicine.

04:22.668 --> 04:24.947
Don't do that! Don't do anything out of the ordinary.

04:25.076 --> 04:27.364
- I won't. Honey, I'm kidding. 
- What?

04:27.517 --> 04:29.704
- There's a horse in the dining room. 
- What?

04:30.005 --> 04:32.090
- Cletus is in the dining room. 
- Why?

04:32.239 --> 04:35.259
He heard about the terrific continental breakfast? I don't know. I gotta go look into this.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.133
Okay. Bye.

04:38.082 --> 04:39.540
Cletus, honey!

04:39.791 --> 04:41.824
Lorelai, I need your signature on this, please.

04:42.795 --> 04:43.927
- Michel. 
- Yes?

04:44.118 --> 04:46.584
Do you see the big-nostriled thing next to me here?

04:46.744 --> 04:48.162
- The horse? 
- Uh-huh, the horse.

04:48.361 --> 04:51.209
- It's been here for twenty minutes. 
- Oh. What were you doing about it?

04:51.614 --> 04:53.451
- Nothing. 
- Oh, no, nothing?

04:53.585 --> 04:57.095
It's a giant, smelly horse. I figured someone was already taking care of it.

04:57.219 --> 04:59.169
- He's alive! 
- Who?

04:59.420 --> 05:01.766
Jack LaLanne. I just googled him. Hi, Cletus.

05:02.073 --> 05:03.312
Oh, so you already saw the horse?

05:03.445 --> 05:05.959
- Yeah. Sure, he's been here, what, twenty, thirty minutes? 
- About twenty-five.

05:06.239 --> 05:09.543
New Dragonfly Inn rule -- everyone listening?

05:09.681 --> 05:14.637
Okay, if you see a horse in the inn or any other large quadruped or biped

05:14.719 --> 05:16.869
or anything that's not -- what's the word -- human,

05:17.029 --> 05:20.346
figure no one's doing anything about it and do something.

05:20.495 --> 05:22.722
- Oh, fine with me. 
- Yeah, same here.

05:22.932 --> 05:25.969
If we had the rule before, I would have done something.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.360
Okay. Great. Thanks. Bye.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.177
Come on, troublemaker.

05:31.243 --> 05:34.472
- Hittin' the road, Glenn? 
- Yep, and I got a hot date tonight.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.397
- Who's the lucky girl? 
- I'm getting back together with my girl from back home.

05:37.682 --> 05:39.209
- Want to see her picture? 
- Sure.

05:40.667 --> 05:43.627
- Glenn, this girl is, like, twelve years old. 
- It's her when she was little.

05:44.007 --> 05:47.333
Don't make this into something dirty! She drives and everything.

05:48.460 --> 05:49.593
Have a good summer, Glenn.

05:51.456 --> 05:54.206
Oh, Rory, perfect timing. I want you to meet somebody.

05:54.524 --> 05:58.522
- This is my boyfriend, Chester Fleet. 
- Oh, hi, Chester. I've heard a lot about you.

05:58.706 --> 05:59.914
You can't believe everything you hear.

06:00.073 --> 06:02.755
Oh, it's kind of a weird day to meet him because he lost a bet with me.

06:02.864 --> 06:06.590
And that means that for the entire day, he can only talk in clichés. It's so much fun.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.935
- Sounds it. 
- It's always fun till someone gets hurt.

06:09.079 --> 06:10.499
Hey, I'm leaving, guys.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.216
- Rory, you get yourself a funky monkey? 
- What?

06:13.431 --> 06:16.704
Everyone poured all the alcohol they had left into a bowl and that's what's in the cup.

06:16.855 --> 06:19.478
- Tastes gross, but does the trick. 
- I stashed one in the fridge for you.

06:19.591 --> 06:21.377
It was poured for me, but I'm not having one.

06:21.521 --> 06:24.942
- Lips that touch wine shall never touch mine. 
- So much fun!

06:25.111 --> 06:28.797
Well, I guess this is goodbye. See you, Rory. Have a good one.

06:28.915 --> 06:31.003
- Bye, Janet. 
- Janet, wait, wait!

06:33.558 --> 06:36.477
I hate that our little clique is breaking up. It's so the end of something.

06:36.630 --> 06:39.369
- You off your meds, Paris? 
- You never get emotional at goodbyes?

06:39.707 --> 06:41.135
With people I like.

06:41.833 --> 06:43.046
- See you. 
- Keep in touch.

06:44.486 --> 06:48.964
So I made a collage of photos of people in the building, and I'm having everyone sign.

06:49.318 --> 06:50.849
- Will you two do me the honor? 
- Sure.

06:51.018 --> 06:53.009
- I'll honor you. 
- Isn't it a great keepsake?

06:53.240 --> 06:55.851
There's Janet with her boyfriend and Lana with hers.

06:55.989 --> 06:57.909
That's Mark and Stacy -- they're inseparable.

06:58.027 --> 06:59.926
- And, oh, there's one of you, Rory. 
- That's me.

07:00.065 --> 07:03.084
And, Janet and her boyfriend again, and me with Chester.

07:03.349 --> 07:05.974
- You're the apple of my eye. 
- That's getting annoying there, Chester.

07:06.267 --> 07:10.699
And, there you are again, Rory, with... oh, that's a lamppost.

07:11.057 --> 07:13.776
Oh, here's a bunch of couples from Valentine's Day. You're not in that one.

07:13.930 --> 07:17.734
And here you are with all the cafeteria ladies. I can make you a copy of that, if you'd like.

07:17.868 --> 07:20.755
- That's okay. 
- Rory, you've had quite the dry spell this year.

07:20.897 --> 07:23.709
- I have not had a dry spell. 
- There's not one picture of you with a guy.

07:23.857 --> 07:27.284
Oh, no. No. There's one. See? That's Rory with the statue of Eli Yale.

07:27.452 --> 07:28.250
People are gonna talk.

07:28.477 --> 07:30.207
I don't care what people say.

07:31.359 --> 07:33.914
- Are people talking? 
- Not that I've heard. You just don't get out enough.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.832
All work and no play makes Jack...

07:37.793 --> 07:39.509
- Say goodbye before you leave? 
- Will do.

07:41.112 --> 07:43.826
Since when are you someone who defines a girl by whether or not she's with a guy?

07:43.917 --> 07:46.351
I mean, you embarrassed me in front of Tana and Chester.

07:46.457 --> 07:49.561
Please. They were singing the lumberjack song at the top of their lungs.

07:49.663 --> 07:51.456
They're embarrassment-proof. Here.

07:52.243 --> 07:54.076
What's this? Leonard Fleming?

07:54.230 --> 07:57.066
Asher's son. He's a terrific guy -- good looking, runs a mutual fund,

07:57.174 --> 07:59.267
- newly divorced, and on the hunt. 
- I don't think so.

07:59.422 --> 08:02.663
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. He is one hot apple, juicy to the core.

08:02.791 --> 08:05.151
- I got it. Nice, hot apple. 
- I just want you to be happy.

08:05.284 --> 08:07.293
Please, don't feel sorry for me. I'm fine.

08:07.409 --> 08:08.955
I don't want you to have a long, dry summer.

08:09.093 --> 08:10.644
Please stop talking about my love life.

08:10.784 --> 08:13.148
Fine. Wish me a merry trip to jolly old England.

08:13.317 --> 08:14.177
Have a merry trip.

08:14.367 --> 08:17.009
And hey, if you call Leonard and one of his kids answers, hang up.

08:17.112 --> 08:18.341
They still think Mommy's coming back.

08:22.186 --> 08:23.173
Oh, hey, Mrs. Kim.

08:23.578 --> 08:24.822
Hello, Lorelai. What can I do for you?

08:25.278 --> 08:29.328
Well, do you still have the big door knockers -- metal with the chipped red paint?

08:31.065 --> 08:33.578
You're a magician. Do you know that? Oh, it's great. Isn't it big?

08:33.854 --> 08:36.250
And good price, seeing as how it may have belonged to James Madison.

08:36.394 --> 08:38.892
It was commonly known that James Madison liked big knockers.

08:39.860 --> 08:42.087
I bet a lot of the founding fathers liked big knockers.

08:43.327 --> 08:45.328
I'm sorry for laughing. I'd explain if I could.

08:45.466 --> 08:48.258
It's a double entendre. I've been in this country 20 years. I get things.

08:48.405 --> 08:49.158
I never doubted.

08:49.537 --> 08:50.924
- It's ninety dollars. 
- I'll take it.

08:53.294 --> 08:54.600
- Here. 
- What's this?

08:54.908 --> 08:57.166
Mail for Lane. I know you go to Luke's, where she works.

08:57.263 --> 08:59.700
If you could pass this on to her, I would appreciate it.

08:59.899 --> 09:02.747
- Mrs. Kim, hasn't this gone on long enough? 
- Not for you to say.

09:02.885 --> 09:06.750
She's your only child. I know you miss her. She misses you.

09:06.949 --> 09:10.717
- Call her. See her. Don't avoid her. 
- This is between me and my daughter.

09:10.852 --> 09:12.719
Well, as your mailman, I hereby resign.

09:14.994 --> 09:15.644
Fine.

09:16.739 --> 09:18.045
It comes to $140.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.881
- You said ninety. 
- Wrapping charge.

09:23.148 --> 09:27.000
And it's not just guys -- girls are not supposed to be monogamous, either.

09:27.071 --> 09:30.031
- We're homo sapiens, not rocks. 
- That'so unromantic.

09:30.287 --> 09:32.165
You can say that. You got lucky.

09:32.361 --> 09:35.959
- Yeah, T.J. Is yum, yum. 
- I did get lucky, didn't I?

09:36.109 --> 09:38.709
We're animals, and animals in the wild don't mate for life,

09:38.812 --> 09:40.629
except, like, tigers, but they're retarded.

09:40.988 --> 09:43.061
- Hey, Liz. 
- Men are good for two things.

09:43.210 --> 09:45.372
Make that one, and the one thing they're not that good at.

09:45.483 --> 09:47.363
Excuse me, sorry to break up the festivities,

09:47.472 --> 09:50.287
but do you have any idea if I'm doing this right?

09:50.409 --> 09:52.477
Most guys don't know if they're doing it right.

09:52.774 --> 09:56.282
Not my expertise, bro, but they smell good, if that helps.

09:56.389 --> 09:58.664
Well, there should have been an instruction book of some kind.

09:58.811 --> 10:02.092
I'm so sorry this got dumped on you, but the turkey leg guy knew

10:02.190 --> 10:05.161
that going into that bar violated his parole. You can't reason with him.

10:05.292 --> 10:07.141
Is this how turkey legs are supposed to look?

10:07.264 --> 10:09.670
I don't know. Take off your pants and let us see.

10:10.536 --> 10:12.436
Hey, weren't you guys going to a spa or something?

10:12.589 --> 10:14.198
- Yeah, we're going, right? 
- In a minute.

10:14.330 --> 10:18.202
- I need to get some batteries. I'll be back. 
- Jess! Jess! Come over here and meet my oldest friends.

10:18.300 --> 10:20.059
- Watch the one on the left. 
- Thanks.

10:20.207 --> 10:24.437
- Girls, this is Jess. 
- Hello, handsome.

10:25.517 --> 10:28.272
He's gonna walk me down the aisle. Is that cool or what?

10:28.420 --> 10:30.786
- It's no big deal. 
- It's a very big deal.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.960
- Can I help you? 
- Got a package here.

10:34.079 --> 10:36.708
- From who? I'm not expecting anything. 
- It's a very important package.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.562
- But there's no address on it. 
- Have fun.

10:39.976 --> 10:42.398
- Have fun with what? 
- This package is for Liz Danes.

10:42.587 --> 10:44.288
- Oh, that -- that's me. 
- Do you accept delivery?

10:45.465 --> 10:46.269
I guess.

10:53.181 --> 10:56.371
- Shake it, doll, shake it. 
- No, don't shake it in here.

10:56.570 --> 10:59.427
- Luke, we need change! 
- Turn these twenties into ones!

10:59.699 --> 11:01.577
I don't believe this, you rats!

11:02.069 --> 11:03.671
Earn your money for Mama!

11:14.531 --> 11:17.065
Nail polish remover -- $1.40.

11:17.527 --> 11:20.569
Ladies Speed Stick -- $2.60. Good choice on that one.

11:20.660 --> 11:24.940
Keeps you dry all day and into the night. Jasmine body lotion -- nice price on that.

11:25.063 --> 11:27.353
- Might want to get a couple. 
- It's for my wife.

11:27.511 --> 11:30.967
And, with your emery boards, it comes to $19.67.

11:32.148 --> 11:33.393
Keep the change.

11:37.254 --> 11:40.870
I'm so sorry you have a final tomorrow. I thought you'd be free as a bird tonight.

11:40.977 --> 11:41.853
Them's the breaks.

11:42.241 --> 11:45.149
You could have stayed at school and studied if you had to. I hope you know that.

11:45.329 --> 11:46.543
You're playing different music.

11:47.443 --> 11:50.162
The music -- it's different. Some chick is singing.

11:50.387 --> 11:52.242
It's "Blossom Deary." You don't like it?

11:52.384 --> 11:55.840
No, I like it fine. You've just never played it. You and Dad always play classical music.

11:55.957 --> 11:58.103
- We just thought we'd try something new tonight. 
- We?

11:58.278 --> 12:01.990
He's out of town, but you know what I mean. We talked about changing the music.

12:02.810 --> 12:05.103
So when will you be done with your final tomorrow?

12:05.357 --> 12:07.361
Around noon, depending on how fast I write.

12:07.550 --> 12:11.205
Any friends left behind to keep you company -- girlfriends, boyfriends?

12:11.365 --> 12:15.332
Well, my roommates are all gone, and I'd say 95% of the class has vamoosed.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.355
- And you don't have a boyfriend? 
- Not really.

12:17.514 --> 12:18.261
Why, do you?

12:19.286 --> 12:21.497
- I'm making a joke. 
- I was just wondering.

12:21.616 --> 12:25.307
We haven't talked about your love life in a while. I get to ask sometimes, don't I?

12:26.039 --> 12:26.741
Sure.

12:26.945 --> 12:29.684
- Where'd you say Dad was? 
- In Philadelphia.

12:29.854 --> 12:31.962
Thanks, Mom. Philadelphia, huh?

12:32.049 --> 12:34.948
Funny, you didn't mention that to me when we talked earlier. You just said he wouldn't be here.

12:35.158 --> 12:38.577
Well, what do you want, Lorelai? For his secretary to fax you his schedule?

12:38.732 --> 12:40.293
No, I just want to be kept informed.

12:40.457 --> 12:45.971
Well, a lot of his schedule these days has to do with Floyd AKA your ex-boyfriend's father.

12:46.053 --> 12:48.076
I didn't know how much detail you wanted to hear.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.113
I hear you. Blossom hears you. We're good.

12:50.538 --> 12:53.155
- So you'll be a free girl around noon? 
- Around then.

12:53.292 --> 12:56.821
I just wanted to know because I to be thinking about you right at that moment

12:56.881 --> 12:59.863
- when the weight is lifting off your shoulders. 
- I'll be looking forward to it.

13:00.021 --> 13:04.317
I'll be right back. I'm going to see if Kiki put the raspberry soufflés in.

13:04.455 --> 13:06.543
- Dad hates raspberries. 
- No, he doesn't.

13:06.780 --> 13:09.012
Oh, sorry, thought he did. Sorry.

13:10.476 --> 13:14.264
- What is going on here? 
- I'm trying to get her to fess up to the separation.

13:14.367 --> 13:16.595
No, me! Am I cloaked in loneliness or something?

13:16.717 --> 13:19.215
Everybody has been pestering me about my love life this week.

13:19.329 --> 13:21.935
That was not about you. It was about evading my questions.

13:22.058 --> 13:24.496
It's a classic Sun Tzu "Art of War" maneuver.

13:24.627 --> 13:27.545
If you're being attacked from the east, attack whoever's to your west,

13:27.654 --> 13:30.259
and you were the west. I never read the book. It's full of crap like that.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.195
Well, stop attacking her so she'll stop attacking me.

13:32.308 --> 13:35.758
Well, you butted into my line of inquiry with your, "He's in Philadelphia" stuff.

13:35.852 --> 13:37.790
- She was about ready to crack. 
- She was not ready to crack.

13:37.883 --> 13:39.404
She was ready to say, "He's in Philadelphia."

13:39.518 --> 13:41.293
Did he sound like he was in Philadelphia when he called?

13:41.380 --> 13:44.206
You mean, did I hear guys in the background saying, "Get your Philly cheesesteak here?"

13:44.279 --> 13:46.691
- Why aren't you seeing anybody, by the way? 
- I'm gonna throw a roll at you.

13:46.772 --> 13:48.605
I just gotta know what's going on with them.

13:48.763 --> 13:51.380
They're having some sort of marital difficulty, Mom,

13:51.472 --> 13:54.529
- and pressuring her like this is not going to help. 
- But I'm dying here.

13:54.641 --> 13:59.307
I mean, if he's out of town, is she actually staying here instead of that hotel she checked into?

13:59.389 --> 14:02.071
Or is she staying here permanently, and he's the one who's at a hotel? Or...

14:02.762 --> 14:06.818
Well, thank God I checked or we would have been soufflé-less.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.244
Well, good, good. Gotta have that soufflé.

14:09.890 --> 14:13.089
- So, where were we? 
- We were all about to switch to new subjects.

14:13.304 --> 14:14.452
Oh, okay.

14:15.296 --> 14:17.575
Dad hates chicken Kiev, doesn't he?

14:21.138 --> 14:22.470
Well, who called Groton?

14:22.592 --> 14:23.717
- I didn't. 
- Me neither.

14:23.846 --> 14:28.393
Someone in this room called someone in Groton at 11:37 P.M. on the 16th, and it wasn't me.

14:28.516 --> 14:30.968
That was the night you had those two trampy girls over, Zach.

14:31.066 --> 14:31.921
They weren't trampy.

14:31.997 --> 14:35.408
I heard one of them call her boyfriend and brag that she had scored some sucker beer.

14:35.956 --> 14:37.379
I'll pay for Groton.

14:39.374 --> 14:42.370
Does that doorbell run on electricity? 'Cause that's eating up money, too.

14:42.457 --> 14:43.538
We have to tell people to knock.

14:44.906 --> 14:46.763
- Aunt Jun. 
- I'm here on your mother's behalf.

14:46.871 --> 14:48.258
- She would like to visit. 
- Here?

14:48.381 --> 14:49.585
- A social call. 
- When?

14:49.770 --> 14:51.521
Here are three times she can come this week.

14:51.782 --> 14:53.839
If none are convenient, she will offer three more.

14:54.245 --> 14:57.485
If those are not good, she will rescind the offer. Does this sound reasonable?

14:57.750 --> 14:58.954
- Very. 
- Fine.

14:59.529 --> 15:01.565
- Is she bringing a Bible? 
- She didn't say.

15:03.026 --> 15:04.169
- Here's your mail. 
- Thank you.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.313
- Would you like to come in? 
- No.

15:14.980 --> 15:15.656
Rory?

15:17.079 --> 15:18.057
Grandma, hi.

15:19.122 --> 15:19.762
You busy?

15:20.294 --> 15:24.140
No, I was just packing and having a little lemonade here.

15:24.534 --> 15:27.606
- You're done with your final, right? 
- Yes. What are you doing here?

15:27.807 --> 15:31.867
Well, I had lunch today on campus with a friend -- Cassie Sullivan.

15:31.994 --> 15:34.836
She's with the alumni committee. Didn't I mention it last night?

15:35.031 --> 15:36.275
Not that I remember.

15:36.490 --> 15:40.170
Anyway, she has a son who's a freshman also -- Graham Sullivan.

15:40.345 --> 15:42.142
- You haven't met him? 
- I don't think so.

15:42.352 --> 15:43.572
- Would you like to? 
- Sure.

15:43.708 --> 15:44.931
- Is now okay? 
- Now?

15:45.363 --> 15:46.130
Graham!

15:48.031 --> 15:50.545
Graham, this is Rory.

15:50.842 --> 15:51.803
Rory, Graham.

15:53.030 --> 15:57.359
Graham's family and ours go way back. I remember this young man in diapers.

15:58.127 --> 16:01.214
He's one of the poor unfortunates who had a Saturday final, too.

16:01.424 --> 16:02.945
- Chemistry. 
- Philosophy.

16:03.406 --> 16:07.317
I meant to introduce the two of you ages ago. I hate that it's last minute like this.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.877
- I feel awful. 
- Oh, that's okay. Don't feel bad.

16:10.286 --> 16:11.792
Alcohol on your breath.

16:12.657 --> 16:16.508
Graham mentioned that he and his group were going out tonight to celebrate.

16:16.595 --> 16:19.185
- What did you call them -- "the Saturday orphans"? 
- Yes, I did.

16:19.278 --> 16:21.295
- And he thought you might like to go. 
- Yeah.

16:21.751 --> 16:23.301
Would you... like to go?

16:24.628 --> 16:25.991
- Sure. 
- Wonderful!

16:26.139 --> 16:30.106
I actually tried to get your grandmother to go, too, but she made up some dumb excuse.

16:30.537 --> 16:32.544
You're something else, you know that?

16:32.994 --> 16:36.158
Well, I feel good about this. My orphan is an orphan no more.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.146
I'll go now. Bye, Rory.

16:39.123 --> 16:39.958
Bye, grandma.

16:43.133 --> 16:46.962
Okay, well, lesson number one -- when your mom or your grandmother

16:47.038 --> 16:50.618
starts trying to pin down your specific whereabouts at a specific time and place,

16:50.710 --> 16:54.770
and she's smiling kind of weird, begin evasive maneuvers immediately.

16:54.878 --> 16:56.327
Got caught in that one myself.

16:56.633 --> 17:01.140
And lesson number two -- never, ever let anybody outside of your family see you in diapers.

17:01.256 --> 17:02.824
You were young... I hope.

17:05.993 --> 17:09.906
- Oh, you don't have to do that. 
- Oh, I just taped up eight of my own boxes.

17:10.309 --> 17:13.961
- I'm a box-taping machine. Use me. 
- Oh, thank you.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.586
So, the plans for tonight -- they're pretty casual.

17:17.840 --> 17:19.818
There'll be about ten of us. You're totally welcome to come.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.654
I was just gonna go home, but, I don't know, maybe.

17:22.864 --> 17:25.885
We're gonna get some food, hang out. I'll leave you my cell phone number.

17:26.673 --> 17:29.207
- You got a piece of paper? 
- Yeah.

17:33.126 --> 17:34.530
Leonard Fleming.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.325
Ignore that.

17:41.301 --> 17:42.662
- Maybe I'll see you later. 
- Yeah.

17:43.564 --> 17:44.511
Enjoy your lemonade.

17:50.891 --> 17:52.310
What is wrong with this shoe polish?

17:52.412 --> 17:54.281
Pontius Pilate was alive when you bought it?

17:54.364 --> 17:56.652
- Shoe polish goes bad? 
- It's all chunky.

17:56.774 --> 17:59.575
- Aah, it messed up my shoes. 
- Just wipe them off. They'll be fine.

18:00.446 --> 18:02.621
- Don't you have a full-length mirror? 
- Don't need one.

18:02.830 --> 18:05.760
You don't like looking at your bottom half? I love looking at my bottom half.

18:05.837 --> 18:08.078
I look down to look at my bottom half. I don't need a mirror to do that.

18:08.218 --> 18:10.235
- You seem nervous. 
- I'm not nervous.

18:10.337 --> 18:13.138
I don't see why you would be. I'm the one getting shackled today.

18:14.152 --> 18:15.596
- Looks like old polish. 
- Yep.

18:15.847 --> 18:18.023
The Queer Eye guys are very against old polish.

18:19.170 --> 18:21.059
- He's very nervous. 
- I'm not nervous.

18:21.298 --> 18:23.793
- Maybe it's time you put a shirt on. 
- Why, am I getting you hot?

18:24.078 --> 18:26.215
- I need the bathroom. 
- Just hold on.

18:26.414 --> 18:29.425
I am lovin' these tights. They're fantastic.

18:29.738 --> 18:32.938
They lend support everywhere you need it, but they breathe.

18:33.081 --> 18:35.190
- This one. 
- Thanks.

18:35.308 --> 18:37.905
Hey, Luke, I had to borrow your deodorant. I hope that's okay.

18:39.184 --> 18:39.997
Allow me.

18:47.658 --> 18:51.186
Greetings, my lord. Your lady hath arrived to be escorted forthwith.

18:51.263 --> 18:52.983
That's pretty good. I didn't know you spoke Renaissance.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.902
Oh, yeah. I'm quite fluent in Renaissance. You look nice. I'm lovin' the tie.

18:56.019 --> 18:57.565
Thanks. You look beautiful.

18:57.912 --> 18:59.669
Flattery will get you everywhere, my friend.

18:59.900 --> 19:00.959
- Shall we? 
- Let's go.

19:14.916 --> 19:17.128
No, really, a nice, manly wreath in your hair wouldn't work?

19:17.364 --> 19:19.055
There's no such thing as a manly wreath.

19:19.196 --> 19:23.299
Oh, I don't know. Julius Caesar pulled it off. He was very popular with the ladies.

19:23.366 --> 19:26.191
Cleopatra used to pull his leaves off -- very sexy.

19:26.401 --> 19:31.541
What's this? Surely these be time travelers from the future in such foreign, mystical garb.

19:31.644 --> 19:33.702
- And who be you, kind sir? 
- T.J.'s brother.

19:33.805 --> 19:36.717
I got a patio furniture store down in Nutley. Plastic, metal, teak...

19:36.763 --> 19:39.841
- whatever you need, I can hook you up. 
- Okay, thank you.

19:40.082 --> 19:44.121
Just do me a favor. I'm gonna try to keep a happy, proud look on my face

19:44.194 --> 19:47.107
to cover the smirking and about-to-laugh-my-ass-off face just underneath.

19:47.159 --> 19:48.659
- Help me achieve this. 
- Oh, come on.

19:48.730 --> 19:51.919
They have a community of people, friends, you know, who travel together,

19:51.992 --> 19:54.747
engage in silliness, dress in costume. I think it's nice.

19:54.991 --> 19:57.363
- Hi, Lucas. 
- Oh! Hi, Carrie.

19:57.535 --> 19:59.575
- Is that a power suit? 
- It's my only suit.

19:59.707 --> 20:03.838
Looks pretty powerful to me. So, Barry stayed home.

20:03.998 --> 20:05.283
- Who? 
- The ball and chain.

20:05.365 --> 20:08.181
- I'm flying solo tonight. Save a dance for me? 
- I don't dance.

20:08.386 --> 20:11.929
- You will dance. 
- Hey, how 'bout we work on him together?

20:12.276 --> 20:14.986
I think there's a hoofer buried deep inside there, don't you?

20:15.118 --> 20:17.065
- I guess. 
- Carrie, this is Lorelai.

20:17.239 --> 20:18.795
- I know. Hi. 
- Hi.

20:19.097 --> 20:24.012
So, there's gonna be a little delay. Liz ripped her dress, and it's gonna take a while to fix it.

20:24.114 --> 20:26.102
I'm supposed to spread the message.

20:26.224 --> 20:28.549
Well spread it, Car -- the message, the message.

20:31.123 --> 20:32.962
She makes me very uncomfortable.

20:33.126 --> 20:34.840
Poor Liz. Does she know how to fix something like that?

20:34.923 --> 20:36.833
She was never one for household skills.

20:36.955 --> 20:39.664
- I'm gonna go see. She's at Miss Patty's? 
- Don't leave me alone.

20:40.248 --> 20:42.726
Carrie found the guy with the codpiece. That will keep her occupied.

20:43.888 --> 20:44.759
Hurry back.

20:46.897 --> 20:50.513
Oh, Lorelai, thank heavens. I'm so bad with wardrobe.

20:50.602 --> 20:52.824
I ripped it getting up. I'm such a klutz.

20:53.034 --> 20:55.751
Oh, well, that's why I'm here. Patty, you have a sewing kit?

20:55.911 --> 20:58.214
- Oh, yeah. Right here, sweetie. 
- I'm holding everyone up.

20:58.331 --> 21:02.644
No, no. Hey, today's your day. If anyone gets to hold things up, it's you. Relax.

21:02.782 --> 21:05.561
Ohh, I'm nervous. Do I look nervous? I sound nervous.

21:05.695 --> 21:08.623
You look great. It's normal to be nervous on your wedding day.

21:09.028 --> 21:11.604
This is my first wedding of mine that I've ever been sober for.

21:11.700 --> 21:13.489
I'm probably gonna remember this one.

21:13.570 --> 21:15.735
The ones that you remember are the ones that stick.

21:15.832 --> 21:17.486
What was your wedding like? Were you this nervous?

21:17.609 --> 21:19.345
- Never been married. 
- You got a kid.

21:19.473 --> 21:22.345
- Found a way around that. 
- I see. You want to get married?

21:22.520 --> 21:25.735
Oh, now, Liz. It's inappropriate for you to propose to me on your wedding day.

21:27.031 --> 21:29.733
But do you want to get married? You must want to get married.

21:29.832 --> 21:31.802
I guess so, you know, if I meet the right guy.

21:32.150 --> 21:37.491
I hate being single. Ever think, if you got married today or even in the next few years,

21:37.679 --> 21:40.624
you could be married for fifty years -- for most of your life.

21:40.706 --> 21:44.428
Same with me and T.J. I could be married most of my life to him.

21:44.581 --> 21:47.295
- Isn't that weird to think about? 
- I could be married for most of my life.

21:47.439 --> 21:50.675
I don't want to screw up this marriage even more than I want some pot.

21:50.914 --> 21:52.144
That's how serious I am.

21:53.972 --> 21:55.534
Are you ready? The crowd's getting restless.

21:55.616 --> 21:58.375
You're getting restless. Hey, do you two know each other?

21:58.468 --> 22:00.945
Oh, Jess and I go way back. He dated my daughter.

22:01.028 --> 22:03.634
- Oh, you broke her daughter's heart? 
- Ah, I...

22:03.792 --> 22:06.152
No, no, he didn't. It just didn't work out.

22:06.317 --> 22:09.060
Good, 'cause I don't want him to be like his father, breaking hearts.

22:09.143 --> 22:11.748
I want him to be like T.J. Or my second husband

22:11.867 --> 22:15.955
or, like my boyfriend after my third husband, who died. They were good guys.

22:16.162 --> 22:17.116
Oh. You're all done.

22:17.565 --> 22:20.145
- Oh, it's perfect! 
- Oh, she's a miracle worker.

22:20.315 --> 22:22.034
- I'm gonna go tell the others. 
- Thanks, hon!

22:22.276 --> 22:24.734
And thank you. You're gonna make a great wife some day

22:24.806 --> 22:27.744
and a great sister-in-law to some very lucky girl.

22:27.841 --> 22:30.156
- Well, I hope so. 
- Now, go on, Luke's waiting.

22:30.252 --> 22:32.900
Unless my friend Carrie suffocated him with her boobs.

22:32.997 --> 22:34.779
Well, that would be festive. Here, Patty.

22:34.998 --> 22:37.466
Let's check your hair real quick, sweetie.

22:37.702 --> 22:38.588
Oh, okay.

22:56.949 --> 22:58.818
- Everything okay? 
- Crisis averted.

23:02.096 --> 23:03.303
Must be starting.

23:03.538 --> 23:04.623
Think they know any Zeppelin?

23:07.491 --> 23:08.540
Ooh, roses -- nice.

23:10.036 --> 23:11.398
Does she remind you of someone?

23:13.018 --> 23:14.551
Can you say Leslie Van Houten?

23:21.386 --> 23:23.241
- Now, that's impressive. 
- Yeah.

23:24.162 --> 23:25.887
These tights, I'm telling you -- the best.

23:26.384 --> 23:29.395
I'm happy, my boys are happy, and they don't ride up.

23:30.120 --> 23:32.532
Hey... still dry. Thanks, buddy.

23:34.085 --> 23:35.876
- You dried his armpits? 
- I don't want to talk about it.

23:41.591 --> 23:42.753
Oh, I want one of those.

23:50.842 --> 23:52.624
- She looks happy. 
- Yeah, she does.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.042
- She looks hot. 
- Smokin'.

23:58.144 --> 23:59.348
Don't you say that.

24:12.326 --> 24:13.156
Where's the minister?

24:13.386 --> 24:16.228
As kids we shared our toys

24:16.479 --> 24:19.412
with all the girls and boys

24:19.741 --> 24:26.089
barrel of monkeys, your battleship sunk me, please recall the joy

24:26.580 --> 24:29.202
Wheelo, Clue, Mousetrap

24:29.362 --> 24:32.325
bash and spirograph

24:32.485 --> 24:35.663
kaleidoscopes spinning, Yahtzee I'm winning

24:35.802 --> 24:38.624
think of how we laughed

24:38.731 --> 24:41.751
but today we share our love

24:41.874 --> 24:44.696
today we share our love

24:44.793 --> 24:50.942
for love is the greatest toy around

24:51.142 --> 24:53.911
around, around

24:54.988 --> 24:55.661
Help.

24:56.509 --> 24:58.321
- Think of something not funny. 
- Can't.

24:58.556 --> 25:00.814
You may plant the ceremonial sword.

25:05.151 --> 25:07.372
- Avalanches, earthquakes... 
- Not doin' it.

25:07.562 --> 25:08.755
Famine... and I'm out.

25:08.850 --> 25:11.693
Hello, friends. Isn't it a beautiful day?

25:12.518 --> 25:18.555
The day that Liz and T.J. share their love in front of those they love.

25:19.128 --> 25:21.899
Liz, do you want to tell T.J. how you feel?

25:22.088 --> 25:22.764
Yes.

25:25.175 --> 25:26.332
- T.J. 
- Yeah?

25:27.325 --> 25:29.056
My heart just pours out to you.

25:29.420 --> 25:32.492
You have been so good to me and for me.

25:32.585 --> 25:34.504
I don't know where I'd be without you.

25:35.436 --> 25:36.967
I'd be worse off, I know that.

25:39.674 --> 25:40.555
You're something else.

25:41.369 --> 25:42.792
Nice. T.J.

25:44.801 --> 25:48.990
Well, I wrote something down, but, for all the good points about tights

25:49.065 --> 25:52.277
-- and there are a lot -- they don't have pockets.

25:53.166 --> 25:55.568
So I gotta go off the cuff.

25:57.514 --> 25:58.394
I love ya.

26:03.053 --> 26:04.457
Aw, that wasn't so funny.

26:04.820 --> 26:06.541
Nah, that wasn't funny at all.

26:11.968 --> 26:14.318
- Hi, Mama. 
- Hello, Lane. Thank you for having me.

26:14.455 --> 26:15.568
You find the place okay?

26:15.768 --> 26:20.282
Yes. Here. Multi-grain soy pudding. Extra chunky, the way you like it.

26:20.620 --> 26:21.754
I bet we'll all like it.

26:22.137 --> 26:22.767
We?

26:23.755 --> 26:24.588
Come in, Mama.

26:27.881 --> 26:31.244
Mama, these are my roommates -- Zach and Brian.

26:31.404 --> 26:33.164
- Hello, Mrs. Kim. 
- Welcome.

26:33.508 --> 26:36.340
There's no way I could afford a place on my own, so we live together.

26:36.447 --> 26:38.725
We share all the expenses and a bathroom.

26:38.991 --> 26:41.459
That's unfortunate, but we're starving artists, Mama.

26:41.556 --> 26:42.554
These are my bandmates.

26:43.534 --> 26:45.715
- Zach, would you make us some tea? 
- I'd be delighted.

26:45.995 --> 26:46.974
I'll get the cups.

26:48.074 --> 26:51.981
How about a tour? This is the living room, obviously.

26:52.248 --> 26:56.636
- That's where Zach and Brian sleep. 
- A solid eight hours every night.

26:57.254 --> 26:58.549
This is my room.

27:00.691 --> 27:04.493
Window's broken but the landlord's on it. Kitchen, refrigerator...

27:04.863 --> 27:07.044
Would you like to pick a tea? We have a whole selection.

27:07.326 --> 27:10.720
Lapsang oolong, orange pekoe, Sleepy Time?

27:19.117 --> 27:21.437
Harry, they've got turkey legs!

27:23.361 --> 27:26.091
I was born four hundred years too late. I mean, this food is amazing.

27:26.991 --> 27:28.200
- Here's a couple seats. 
- Okay.

27:28.758 --> 27:30.421
- There were boys. 
- What? Where?

27:30.616 --> 27:33.765
- At Lane's -- two boys -- one with hair. 
- Okay, you went to Lane's?

27:33.858 --> 27:36.703
And the place -- broken furniture and dirt and boys

27:36.787 --> 27:38.476
- and a broken window and boys... 
- Slow down.

27:38.553 --> 27:40.970
- and a tiny fridge and guitars and boys. 
- How many boys where there?

27:41.030 --> 27:41.875
- Two boys. 
- Two boys.

27:41.952 --> 27:43.525
She stood in that room with two boys.

27:43.595 --> 27:47.077
I didn't stand alone in a room with two boys until I was -- I've never done that.

27:47.195 --> 27:49.432
- Mrs. Kim, you know why the boys were there. 
- She's dirty.

27:49.525 --> 27:53.104
She's not dirty. She was trying to be up front with you, and that's good.

27:53.191 --> 27:54.635
She could have hid them from you, and she didn't.

27:54.722 --> 27:56.324
- I wish she did. 
- No, you don't.

27:56.411 --> 27:58.768
I've met those boys. They're innocent.

27:58.854 --> 28:02.177
As innocent as if she was living with two girls. So think of them that way.

28:02.253 --> 28:03.799
- What way? 
- Think of them as girls.

28:03.958 --> 28:04.972
- Girls? 
- Girls.

28:05.084 --> 28:06.274
I don't like girls either.

28:06.355 --> 28:07.819
- Well, you like them better than boys. 
- True.

28:07.910 --> 28:10.005
- And Lane is trying so hard. 
- Girls.

28:10.108 --> 28:14.788
Yeah, think of them as two tall, gawky, caring, sometimes unwashed girls

28:14.869 --> 28:17.081
who are watching out for your daughter's safety.

28:17.210 --> 28:19.748
Girls. Girls.

28:23.414 --> 28:27.071
- Is she okay? 
- She will be. She'll be okay.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.600
Ooh, hey, look. Jess made a friend.

28:29.702 --> 28:33.081
People think prison's a waste of time, but prison's the best thing that ever happened to me.

28:33.194 --> 28:33.901
Interesting.

28:34.079 --> 28:37.586
Picked up skills -- metal working, laundry -- that's a skill.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.900
Doing laundry for 600 guys -- no piece of cake.

28:41.089 --> 28:41.836
Great.

28:42.507 --> 28:45.226
- Added fabric softener for cigarettes. 
- Career guidance?

28:45.482 --> 28:47.750
He's doing better. He's gonna be okay.

28:47.909 --> 28:53.183
It's like a marketing thing. Don't call 'em "tights." You guys don't want to wear "tights."

28:53.260 --> 28:57.125
Call 'em "air pants." Here's your slogan -- "air pants -- the pants that breathe."

28:57.258 --> 28:59.945
I'm telling you, we gotta get in on the ground floor of this.

29:00.054 --> 29:02.942
There they are -- my two heroes. You saved the wedding.

29:03.019 --> 29:05.651
- I saved nothing. 
- And you're always my hero, my big brother.

29:05.793 --> 29:09.591
- Congratulations, sis. 
- Wasn't Jess great? It made all the difference.

29:09.716 --> 29:12.772
It wasn't like it was a hard thing to do, but he did it good.

29:15.771 --> 29:18.932
- You say "goodbye" before you leave. 
- I'm just going to get more food.

29:19.071 --> 29:20.498
- You promise? 
- I promise.

29:21.143 --> 29:22.486
Come on, let's get some chow.

29:23.402 --> 29:24.748
Okay. Bye, guys.

29:26.366 --> 29:31.553
- Oh, she's so happy. 
- Yeah, and he really loves tights.

29:32.172 --> 29:34.004
- Oh, you want to know something weird? 
- What?

29:34.276 --> 29:38.178
When I was at Miss Patty's, Jess was there.

29:38.264 --> 29:40.491
And he had his backpack, and it was open,

29:40.763 --> 29:43.145
and I saw this book. I thought I was seeing things.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.782
- A book? 
- Yes.

29:44.880 --> 29:48.721
It was a self-help book with some goofy title like, "Learn to Love"

29:48.843 --> 29:51.213
or "How to Love When You're Unloved" or something like that.

29:51.311 --> 29:53.834
- Isn't that bizarre? 
- I don't know.

29:53.994 --> 29:55.786
Well, I'll answer for you. It is bizarre.

29:55.893 --> 29:59.288
Maybe he's just trying to learn something, better himself.

29:59.906 --> 30:03.209
- Have you seen this book? 
- I know nothing about this book.

30:03.296 --> 30:06.281
- Those kinds of books are idiotic. 
- Not if they help people.

30:06.430 --> 30:09.856
I can't believe you're not mocking this book, which is so pathetically mockable.

30:09.927 --> 30:13.782
Maybe it's more pathetic if people don't try. And maybe he's trying. You ever think of that?

30:14.142 --> 30:16.968
- No, but... 
- He can read whatever he wants to read.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.388
I forgot to get something to drink. You need something to drink?

30:20.474 --> 30:21.160
I'm fine.

30:25.477 --> 30:29.086
No way! No way! Duke is gonna dominate the ACC Again.

30:29.178 --> 30:31.329
- No way. 
- Williams? Redick?

30:31.677 --> 30:35.695
Graham, Redick has a 96% free-throw average. It's a done deal.

30:35.768 --> 30:39.588
- Carolina is coming back -- no question. 
- Question. Question.

30:39.900 --> 30:42.362
What is that? Your patented 5-beer comeback?

30:43.473 --> 30:46.156
Seven free throws, man. All season -- seven. That's it.

30:49.874 --> 30:51.630
- You're not drinking. 
- I'm fine.

30:51.829 --> 30:52.961
So you only drink alone?

30:53.565 --> 30:54.987
- Pardon me? 
- The lemonade?

30:55.194 --> 30:58.255
That was just a roommate thing. I don't usually drink.

30:58.404 --> 30:59.777
Oh... pity.

31:03.077 --> 31:04.301
You want to get back to your group?

31:04.584 --> 31:06.873
Not if it's suddenly gonna get exciting over here.

31:07.409 --> 31:08.495
I wouldn't count on it.

31:08.762 --> 31:10.247
You have got to lighten up.

31:10.446 --> 31:12.407
Gee, that's one of my favorite phrases.

31:14.978 --> 31:16.657
- That's a sign, boys. 
- Mucky duck?

31:16.769 --> 31:17.650
Mucky duck!

31:20.543 --> 31:21.178
Let's go.

31:21.966 --> 31:24.706
- We just got here. 
- Well, what's a pub crawl without the crawl?

31:24.931 --> 31:25.780
Who's got my keys?

31:27.301 --> 31:28.177
He's driving?

31:28.299 --> 31:30.348
He's one of the best drunk drivers in Connecticut.

31:30.598 --> 31:31.618
Top fifty, easy.

31:32.417 --> 31:33.184
You ready?

31:33.553 --> 31:35.643
Actually, I just think I'm gonna take off.

31:36.063 --> 31:38.019
- What? 
- Yeah, I'm kind of tired.

31:38.438 --> 31:39.934
-  Rory! 
- Thanks for everything.

31:40.992 --> 31:42.770
Well, do you want me to drive you home?

31:43.614 --> 31:44.971
We came here with Jonah.

31:45.549 --> 31:48.370
Right. Well, you need money for a cab?

31:48.703 --> 31:49.355
I got money.

31:50.312 --> 31:51.223
I feel kind of bad.

31:51.827 --> 31:52.534
Don't.

31:53.410 --> 31:55.222
Okay. See you later.

31:56.081 --> 31:56.716
Bye.

31:57.478 --> 31:58.514
Putz.

32:01.811 --> 32:03.490
Excuse me, is there an ATM here?

32:03.675 --> 32:06.435
A few blocks down. I wouldn't walk, though. It gets dicey at night.

32:19.087 --> 32:24.923
Hi, it's me. I'm kind of stuck and I... Well, I didn't know who else to call.

32:27.155 --> 32:30.438
Okay, it looks like Brian's paying for call waiting for the next two months.

32:30.867 --> 32:32.419
It's not over till it's over.

32:33.299 --> 32:34.482
Lane, door!

32:37.089 --> 32:39.699
I'll throw in my share of next month's gas bill, I'm that confident.

32:39.813 --> 32:41.052
You're gonna eat your confidence.

32:42.291 --> 32:44.026
- Mama. 
- I'm back.

32:44.334 --> 32:45.997
- Pause it, pause it, pause it. 
- Come in.

32:48.921 --> 32:52.736
This, we'll clean up. Window will be fixed. Temporary fridge. You two are girls.

32:55.223 --> 32:56.242
I'll have tea now.

32:56.627 --> 32:57.666
I'll boil water.

32:57.900 --> 32:59.212
I'll bring you our selection.

33:10.381 --> 33:12.862
Hope ye took much pleasure in Kajagoogoo.

33:13.072 --> 33:16.093
Methinks Oingo Boingo wilst soon makest an appearance.

33:16.391 --> 33:19.488
But first, please clear the floor for our happy couple... eth.

33:42.035 --> 33:44.397
Yeah, I'd love to see you juggle sometime. I'm a big fan of juggling.

33:46.394 --> 33:50.065
- He... he juggles for money. 
- You okay?

33:50.264 --> 33:52.251
- Yeah, yeah. 
- We okay?

33:52.385 --> 33:54.878
Yeah, I didn't mean to get so defensive.

33:55.149 --> 33:57.719
I didn't mean to make fun of Jess and what he was reading.

33:57.780 --> 34:01.565
Maybe it's good that he had it. You know, maybe -- he's trying.

34:02.122 --> 34:05.101
It's okay. I mean, that book does sound pretty dorky.

34:05.363 --> 34:09.726
Liz and T.J. wouldst enjoy others to join them in their modest wriggles.

34:10.196 --> 34:13.391
Oh, hey, so your food's probably cold. You want to go get some more?

34:13.590 --> 34:15.844
Sure, or we can... you know.

34:16.862 --> 34:18.225
We can... do what?

34:20.190 --> 34:21.103
You want to dance?

34:22.254 --> 34:23.550
- Really? 
- Yeah.

34:25.429 --> 34:28.429
- You said before you don't dance. 
- Well, I'm a compulsive liar.

34:30.841 --> 34:32.678
Okay, yeah, let's dance.

35:53.514 --> 35:54.170
Dean.

35:55.460 --> 35:58.461
- Oh, thank God, a friendly face. 
- What happened here?

35:58.946 --> 36:02.161
- Oh, I feel so stupid. I was on this date. 
- Oh, yeah?

36:02.371 --> 36:05.116
It was a boy that Grandma saw in diapers.

36:05.300 --> 36:09.570
And she brought him over, and I tagged along on this stupid outing tonight.

36:09.657 --> 36:12.395
- He was in diapers? 
- No, she knew him when he was a little kid.

36:12.525 --> 36:16.037
So it was this whole big group of people, and they were all drinking in the car, smoking.

36:16.164 --> 36:20.036
And I just thought, "These are, maybe, the last people on earth

36:20.118 --> 36:23.415
- that I would want to die in a car crash with." 
- Well, I'm glad you cut it short.

36:23.563 --> 36:25.171
Poor Grandma. It's not her fault.

36:25.356 --> 36:27.727
She was just thinking I was lonely, and diaper boy was nice

36:27.803 --> 36:30.321
and doing her matchmaker thing. Did I say that I feel stupid?

36:30.491 --> 36:32.185
No, that's okay. It's cool.

36:32.427 --> 36:35.432
- And hungry. I haven't eaten since breakfast. 
- Well, then, let's eat.

36:35.631 --> 36:37.218
- I have no money. 
- I've got money.

36:37.552 --> 36:41.269
- Excuse me, we'd like to order. 
- These are your menus right here.

36:41.392 --> 36:42.697
Oh, duh, sorry.

36:43.148 --> 36:44.884
- This going on your tab? 
- What?

36:45.119 --> 36:47.029
That card at the counter? It's still open.

36:48.176 --> 36:50.726
- Put your wallet away, and I hope you're hungry. 
- I can eat.

36:51.492 --> 36:54.165
We will start with the sampler appetizer platter...

36:54.786 --> 36:56.566
- This was fun. 
- Yeah, it was.

36:56.710 --> 37:00.884
So, hard to figure out which part of the evening was my favorite.

37:01.114 --> 37:02.138
There were a few.

37:02.409 --> 37:05.870
T.J. throwing his tights at the bachelors instead of Liz's garter?

37:05.946 --> 37:07.831
- You ducked well, by the way. 
- Pure self-defense.

37:07.965 --> 37:11.519
Ooh, the choking guy being Heimliched by the court jester?

37:11.625 --> 37:12.486
That was good.

37:12.623 --> 37:15.977
Or... the minister making out with crazy Carrie?

37:16.111 --> 37:19.736
T.J.'s brother making out with crazy Carrie? Or that last guy making out with crazy Carrie?

37:19.833 --> 37:21.701
- Who was that guy? 
- I think that was her husband.

37:21.963 --> 37:22.941
Poor Barry!

37:25.250 --> 37:27.267
- And it might be the dance. 
- Really?

37:27.579 --> 37:30.400
- Have you been taking lessons? 
- That was all God-given talent.

37:31.965 --> 37:33.883
- It was fun. 
- Yeah, it was.

37:35.075 --> 37:37.123
- Well, good night. 
- We should do it again.

37:38.618 --> 37:39.827
What, you got another wedding coming up?

37:39.955 --> 37:42.443
Nah, I meant have fun. You know, like a movie or something.

37:42.551 --> 37:46.360
- I didn't think you were a movie guy. 
- I can be a movie guy. You like movies.

37:46.784 --> 37:48.446
Yeah -- good, bad, and in-between.

37:48.746 --> 37:50.963
- How 'bout next week? Sunday? 
- Sunday?

37:51.127 --> 37:53.451
- Sunday -- you free? 
- I think so.

37:53.641 --> 37:57.102
- Okay, good. Good. 
- Good. Good.

37:57.245 --> 37:59.984
I'll see you... before then, but I'll see you then, too.

38:00.098 --> 38:01.772
Yeah, I'll see you both of those thens.

38:13.066 --> 38:15.463
- You leaving? 
- Just hanging around, see if I'd catch you.

38:15.596 --> 38:16.594
Good, I'm glad you did.

38:17.880 --> 38:20.148
You can stay a couple more days, if you want. There's no rush.

38:20.352 --> 38:22.421
- Gotta get back to work. 
- Right, right.

38:23.430 --> 38:25.396
- Did you say "goodbye" to your mom? 
- Yeah, we're good.

38:25.631 --> 38:28.196
I gave her a cellphone number that's pretty permanent. Just got it.

38:28.468 --> 38:30.197
- Left it for you on the fridge. 
- Good.

38:36.471 --> 38:39.629
- I want to pay you back... all the money. 
- You don't have to.

38:39.778 --> 38:44.012
- I want to. And I appreciate it... everything...

38:45.025 --> 38:49.788
- the money, living here. 
- Well, it's good to hear, but I kind of knew that.

38:51.237 --> 38:55.111
Yeah, but, in a relationship -- any relationship --

38:55.209 --> 38:57.513
it's important to let the other person know you appreciate them

38:57.651 --> 39:02.880
so you don't create barriers that delay any hope for reciprocation.

39:03.514 --> 39:05.101
- I think I read that somewhere. 
- Yeah?

39:06.110 --> 39:07.461
You're hoping for reciprocation?

39:09.349 --> 39:10.289
You got it.

39:12.608 --> 39:14.107
I'm here, Jess. I'm always here.

39:16.871 --> 39:17.758
Thanks.

39:29.980 --> 39:31.772
- The tie work out? 
- The tie was perfect.

39:44.167 --> 39:48.341
It's only hitting me now. My classes are done -- done.

39:48.438 --> 39:53.005
I don't have to think about Chaucer or Euclid or Kafka or Machiavelli for months.

39:53.117 --> 39:57.183
I can just think about Jane magazine and why did Uma wear that dress -- fun stuff like that.

39:57.393 --> 40:01.002
You'll still think about Kafka... and probably Chaucer.

40:01.371 --> 40:04.289
Probably. But those other two bozos are history.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.635
You hear me? History!

40:06.480 --> 40:07.616
- See in there? 
- Yeah.

40:07.867 --> 40:09.133
First semester poli sci.

40:09.696 --> 40:11.975
- Which was your seat? 
- Oh, we didn't have assigned seats,

40:12.005 --> 40:14.545
but I usually sat with my back to the window so I wouldn't get distracted.

40:14.934 --> 40:16.593
This campus is huge.

40:16.956 --> 40:20.110
And you're seeing it at a weird time 'cause we're probably the last two people left.

40:22.773 --> 40:27.539
Man, it's good to get out. It's good to laugh. I laughed tonight. You're funny.

40:27.620 --> 40:29.833
- I can be funny. 
- That's what I just said.

40:29.926 --> 40:32.855
- Yeah, but you said it like I never am. 
- You're funny.

40:33.197 --> 40:35.573
- Yeah? Well, this is my room. 
- I know.

40:35.920 --> 40:37.959
- Oh, right, you've been here before. 
- Yeah.

40:39.838 --> 40:43.923
- Well, thanks for saving me. 
- Yeah, anytime.

40:47.590 --> 40:53.764
Dean, how is it that you can be out like this,

40:53.852 --> 40:57.071
here, with me, or with anyone, for that matter?

40:58.762 --> 41:00.165
Where does Lindsay think you are?

41:00.784 --> 41:01.798
She thinks I'm out.

41:02.273 --> 41:04.117
- Out where? 
- Doesn't matter.

41:06.161 --> 41:07.317
What's going on with you?

41:11.137 --> 41:12.013
What are you doing here?

41:13.856 --> 41:15.739
- I need to talk to you. 
- Jess...

41:15.821 --> 41:18.039
- I need to talk to you. 
- What's going on?

41:18.136 --> 41:19.667
- What are you doing here? 
- Rory, please.

41:19.815 --> 41:20.415
Rory?

41:22.780 --> 41:24.173
Go... go home.

41:25.488 --> 41:27.828
- No. 
- Yes, go. You should go.

41:32.969 --> 41:35.197
Why won't you leave me alone? You won't go away.

41:35.273 --> 41:36.471
- Rory. 
- What do you want?

41:36.598 --> 41:40.562
I don't know. I just wanted to see you, talk to you. I just...

41:41.289 --> 41:41.934
What?

41:42.942 --> 41:43.762
Come with me.

41:44.889 --> 41:46.280
- What? 
- Come with me.

41:46.583 --> 41:48.754
- Where? 
- I don't know... away!

41:49.051 --> 41:51.437
- Are you crazy? 
- Probably. Do it. Come with me.

41:51.529 --> 41:53.470
- Don't think about it. 
- I can't do that.

41:53.745 --> 41:56.065
You don't think you can do it but you can. You can do whatever you want.

41:56.142 --> 41:58.252
- It's not what I want. 
- It is. I know you.

41:58.348 --> 42:00.324
- You don't know me! 
- Look, we'll go to New York.

42:00.560 --> 42:03.567
We'll work, we'll live together, we'll be together. It's what I want.

42:03.655 --> 42:05.179
- It's what you want, too. 
- No!

42:05.286 --> 42:07.693
I want to be with you, but not here.

42:07.883 --> 42:11.358
Not this place, not Stars Hollow. We have to start new.

42:11.635 --> 42:16.224
- There's nothing to start! 
- You're packed. Your stuff is all in boxes.

42:16.479 --> 42:20.002
It's perfect. You're ready. And I'm ready. I'm ready for this.

42:20.078 --> 42:22.699
You can count on me now. I know you couldn't count on me before,

42:22.777 --> 42:25.438
- but you can now. You can. 
- No!

42:25.525 --> 42:27.636
Look, you know we're supposed to be together.

42:27.738 --> 42:31.086
I knew it the first time I saw you two years ago, and you know it, too.

42:31.163 --> 42:34.880
- I know you do. 
- No, no, no, no, no!

42:34.958 --> 42:38.081
Don't say "no" just to make me stop talking or make me go away.

42:38.183 --> 42:41.091
Only say "no" if you really don't want to be with me.

42:41.547 --> 42:42.483
No!
