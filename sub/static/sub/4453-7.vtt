WEBVTT

00:01.565 --> 00:04.193
<i>- Gentlemen, if you please.
- We're getting absolutely nowhere.</i>

00:04.318 --> 00:06.695
<i>- May I repeat...
- You made your point, sir.</i>

00:06.820 --> 00:08.948
<i>- For the record, this time.
- For the record,</i>

00:09.073 --> 00:11.450
<i>we are going round and round
and round in circles.</i>

00:11.575 --> 00:13.935
<i>This meeting, I'm beginning to think,
has no shape at all.</i>

00:14.036 --> 00:15.913
<i>No. No shape, nor</i> a <i>purpose. Neither.</i>

00:16.038 --> 00:18.040
May I suggest we start
from the beginning?

00:18.165 --> 00:20.626
No. Let's start at right now.

00:23.295 --> 00:25.548
I want an answer, Mr. Durant.

00:25.881 --> 00:28.259
Not an equivocation,
not a redirect...

00:28.384 --> 00:30.970
A simple answer
to a simple question.

00:31.554 --> 00:35.849
Will the Union Pacific build north or south

00:35.975 --> 00:37.434
of the Great Salt Lake?

00:37.560 --> 00:41.272
The Union Pacific
is planning to build

00:41.397 --> 00:43.190
south to Salt Lake City.

00:43.315 --> 00:46.860
This great city in which we are gathered

00:46.986 --> 00:51.782
is and has always been
our designated terminus.

00:51.907 --> 00:54.201
Are you suggesting
Miss Ellison made this up?

00:54.326 --> 00:58.747
I am stating that Miss Ellison
is a journalist, Mr. President.

00:59.206 --> 01:01.375
She will write anything
to sell newspapers.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.752
I thought her prose well founded,

01:03.877 --> 01:06.547
articulated and... and compelling,
frankly, Mr. Durant.

01:06.672 --> 01:10.092
Nobody is interested
in your literary criticism...

01:10.217 --> 01:12.136
Gentlemen. Per my contract

01:12.261 --> 01:14.638
with Collie Huntington
and the Central Pacific Railroad,

01:14.763 --> 01:17.474
he had agreed to build south
through Salt Lake City.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.934
Cassius?

01:19.476 --> 01:23.480
Yet this map, which I am
recently come to possess,

01:23.606 --> 01:26.358
proves him to be both
a liar and a thief.

01:28.485 --> 01:29.820
Mr. Huntington?

01:32.615 --> 01:35.326
Central Pacific Railroad
intends to build north.

01:35.451 --> 01:40.331
Any, misunderstanding on the part of
Mr. Young is regrettable and unintentional.

01:40.456 --> 01:41.915
I motion

01:42.041 --> 01:45.586
that construction
on the Central Pacific's road

01:45.711 --> 01:48.172
be suspended pending a full inquiry.

01:48.297 --> 01:49.923
I would ask you, Mr. President,

01:50.299 --> 01:52.509
to consider how.

01:52.635 --> 01:54.595
Brigham Young acquired that map,

01:54.720 --> 01:57.056
private property
of the Central Pacific Railroad.

01:57.181 --> 01:58.807
Samuel Ammerman, my...

01:58.932 --> 02:01.226
my telegraph operator,
disappeared ages...

02:01.352 --> 02:05.981
ages ago after being placed there
by Thomas Durant to spy...

02:06.106 --> 02:08.692
That is an unsubstantiated
accusation, sir!

02:08.817 --> 02:10.294
Private business
of a private corporation!

02:10.318 --> 02:11.820
Have not corporations rights, sir?

02:11.945 --> 02:15.366
Now, surely, a penalty
for corporate espionage must be levied.

02:15.491 --> 02:19.662
"Corporate espionage."
You practically invented the concept!

02:19.787 --> 02:20.788
Enough!

02:28.962 --> 02:30.964
- Mr. Bohannon.
- Mr. President.

02:35.344 --> 02:39.682
I promised the American people a railroad
that crosses this country, gentlemen.

02:39.807 --> 02:41.684
It Will be built.

02:41.809 --> 02:44.061
If not by you, by someone else.

02:44.186 --> 02:47.439
We will establish a route
and a terminus,

02:47.564 --> 02:50.109
a place where your two railroads shall meet

02:50.234 --> 02:53.737
before any of us steps foot
outside Salt Lake City.

02:53.862 --> 02:55.239
One hour recess.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:40.284 --> 03:43.495
You know that dream
where a meeting's about to start,

03:43.620 --> 03:45.789
and you look down and you realize

03:45.914 --> 03:47.851
suddenly you've been stripped down
to your unmentionables?

03:47.875 --> 03:49.293
And you're...

03:50.127 --> 03:51.545
Never mind.

03:54.339 --> 03:55.883
You're here now.

03:58.677 --> 04:02.848
We have lost Brigham's trust
and his workers with it.

04:04.016 --> 04:05.893
Regrettable but not irreparable.

04:07.352 --> 04:08.854
We're gonna strike back...

04:11.523 --> 04:13.233
Hit Durant hard.

04:13.358 --> 04:17.237
Listen to me. There is no way
Durant gives up Ogden.

04:17.362 --> 04:19.990
He's lying to Brigham Young
just to keep the Mormon workers

04:20.115 --> 04:22.618
on his payroll long as possible.
We catch him in a lie,

04:22.743 --> 04:24.787
get Grant to give us Ogden

04:24.912 --> 04:26.830
and its millions of dollars'
worth of coal

04:26.955 --> 04:29.750
as penalty for Durant
wasting our time.

04:33.337 --> 04:34.421
I'll pick my spot.

04:37.257 --> 04:39.927
Mr. Bohannon!!

04:40.594 --> 04:43.096
I'd heard Collie had taken you
under his wing.

04:43.972 --> 04:46.975
I hope all this talk of
business and politics

04:47.100 --> 04:48.894
doesn't prove too much of a bore for you.

04:49.019 --> 04:51.814
No. You always keep things interesting.

04:53.774 --> 04:56.485
Well, I try to do my bit.

04:56.610 --> 04:57.611
Well, I...

04:58.445 --> 05:00.572
I hardly recognize you.

05:04.201 --> 05:06.161
<i>We have Durant's support,</i>

05:06.286 --> 05:08.914
but only as long as his interests
align with ours.

05:09.039 --> 05:10.415
He needs our workers,

05:10.541 --> 05:14.628
but not as badly as I need his road.

05:19.550 --> 05:21.093
Father, I've returned.

05:21.218 --> 05:22.719
Yes, four days late,

05:23.512 --> 05:24.930
and wearing unsightly boots.

05:25.848 --> 05:28.326
Your brother and I are concerned
with pressing railroad matters.

05:28.350 --> 05:30.269
The railroad is also my concern.

05:31.436 --> 05:33.276
I pulled the men from Truckee
as you requested.

05:33.355 --> 05:35.691
I've done your bidding, Father,
and I have a small request.

05:37.609 --> 05:39.278
A quick one, I hope.

05:39.403 --> 05:40.821
The Hatchites.

05:40.946 --> 05:43.156
The heretic sect,
I need to know where they are.

05:43.282 --> 05:45.075
What you needed was an awareness

05:45.200 --> 05:47.000
of the treachery brewing
right under your nose

05:47.035 --> 05:48.595
during your time
on the Central Pacific!

05:48.704 --> 05:51.206
Brother Phineas is...
is not at fault, O Lion.

05:51.540 --> 05:53.500
It was the gentiles,
in particular, Cullen Bo...

05:53.625 --> 05:55.544
Don't defend this imbecile!

05:55.961 --> 05:57.671
I'm perfectly aware were it not for you,

05:57.796 --> 06:00.173
our mission there
would've proved twice as disastrous.

06:00.299 --> 06:02.050
You will not speak to me in this way!

06:09.725 --> 06:10.809
Enough.

06:12.477 --> 06:14.146
Get out of my sight.

06:19.192 --> 06:20.485
Now!

06:28.702 --> 06:30.162
Brother Phineas.

06:30.662 --> 06:33.582
No. Brother Phineas...

06:33.707 --> 06:35.083
No. It...

06:35.542 --> 06:38.211
Do you see how he treats me?

06:38.337 --> 06:40.505
I do, it is deplorable.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.886
- Our men are well-trained.
- Yeah.

06:46.011 --> 06:47.012
- Well-armed.
- Yes.

06:47.137 --> 06:49.514
- We have prepared for this.
- We have.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.683
We must strike now.

06:51.808 --> 06:55.771
- Yeah, he has so many well-armed guards...
- Phineas!

06:55.896 --> 06:58.065
And now the soldiers.

06:58.398 --> 07:01.526
No, Zion is better protected
than when we left.

07:01.652 --> 07:03.070
Now, we...

07:03.195 --> 07:06.657
we must be patient.
Phineas, wait.

07:07.240 --> 07:08.825
Hey, Cassius.

07:09.159 --> 07:11.578
Look at you.

07:11.703 --> 07:15.248
The Hatchites are in the Red Valley,
southeast of Camp Douglas.

07:16.333 --> 07:17.709
Couple hours ride from here.

07:19.044 --> 07:20.212
Thank you, Cassius.

07:23.006 --> 07:24.257
Welcome home, brother.

07:27.928 --> 07:30.305
You see, yeah,

07:30.430 --> 07:32.891
Heavenly Father continues
to bestow upon us

07:33.016 --> 07:35.727
his unexpected blessings.

07:35.852 --> 07:39.189
He will tell us when it is time.

07:40.023 --> 07:42.109
I grow tired of waiting, Brother Thor.

07:42.234 --> 07:44.528
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I see that.

07:45.696 --> 07:47.030
I see that.

08:25.527 --> 08:28.155
If only it was your own favors
I was paying for, Madam Eva.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.866
We thank you for your patronage.

08:32.491 --> 08:33.952
Mr. Crigler.

08:35.996 --> 08:38.123
Distracted by your charms, I was.

08:53.138 --> 08:55.640
He takes me,
right there on the stairs,

08:55.766 --> 08:57.225
but he said it didn't count,

08:57.350 --> 08:58.852
"'Cause we wasn't in the sack."

08:58.977 --> 09:00.812
Dumb-ass cowboy!

09:07.819 --> 09:09.529
This box was full.

09:10.489 --> 09:12.282
Seven hundred dollars.

09:13.784 --> 09:15.619
Our money.

09:17.871 --> 09:21.792
Now, whoever's doing this
is stealing from all of us.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.463
Just say it, if you're accusing somebody.

09:27.714 --> 09:29.466
I'm looking at her.

09:29.966 --> 09:31.968
- Josie would never...
- Quiet, Tess!

09:33.970 --> 09:36.139
I'm real scared.

09:36.890 --> 09:39.518
No, no, no.

09:39.643 --> 09:43.021
You're too stupid to be scared.

09:44.022 --> 09:48.693
Highfalutin on account of your pretty face
and your fast hands.

09:49.152 --> 09:52.072
Don't forget, little girl,

09:52.489 --> 09:55.242
I found you in a pile of pig slop

09:55.367 --> 09:57.244
gnawing on a chicken bone.

09:59.538 --> 10:03.667
You cross me, you'll be back there
quicker than you can come.

10:09.214 --> 10:11.049
That money'd best turn up.

10:12.551 --> 10:16.304
Eva ain't fit to be running things.
That's the truth of it.

10:16.429 --> 10:17.889
It's what I been saying, Mick.

10:18.014 --> 10:20.034
She don't protect us from Johns
when they get rowdy,

10:20.058 --> 10:21.893
and now there's this money gone.

10:22.435 --> 10:23.019
Stolen?

10:23.145 --> 10:25.647
All she can do to fix it is blame us.

10:26.565 --> 10:27.983
You mean she blames you?

10:28.108 --> 10:31.027
She's just got it in for me
'cause all the girls like me better.

10:31.153 --> 10:33.488
They listen to Josie.
I've seen it.

10:36.616 --> 10:38.368
And you think you could run the girls?

10:38.493 --> 10:41.580
I could look out for 'em,
keep the cash safe.

10:42.414 --> 10:45.125
Be happy to work alongside Johnny here,
you think that's best.

10:59.472 --> 11:03.018
The route west and south
along the lake, Mr. President,

11:03.935 --> 11:06.146
it crosses open country
for thirty miles.

11:06.271 --> 11:09.524
It has advantages both as to cost

11:09.941 --> 11:11.693
and speed of progress.

11:13.361 --> 11:15.071
As per federal law,

11:15.864 --> 11:18.617
we will acquire the land

11:19.451 --> 11:20.952
and mineral rights

11:21.703 --> 11:24.289
twenty miles on either side
of the southern route,

11:25.790 --> 11:27.292
precise numbers here.

11:29.961 --> 11:32.797
Any questions,
you may direct to the man

11:32.923 --> 11:34.674
who made the survey
for the Union Pacific

11:34.799 --> 11:38.220
while he was in my employ,
Cullen Bohannon.

11:40.805 --> 11:42.365
I have some questions, Mr. President.

11:46.311 --> 11:49.272
This is the route the Union Pacific
plans to follow, exactly?

11:49.814 --> 11:52.943
Saving room
for any necessary detours, yes.

11:56.071 --> 11:57.322
Detours?

11:58.323 --> 12:00.825
Unforeseen departures from the thing

12:00.951 --> 12:03.078
you have committed yourself to doing.

12:04.329 --> 12:06.122
I know you're familiar with the term.

12:06.957 --> 12:08.976
I'm familiar with the route.
And having surveyed it myself,

12:09.000 --> 12:10.752
I assure you it requires no detours.

12:10.877 --> 12:13.338
Come, Bohannon.

12:15.799 --> 12:17.717
Changes in the weather...

12:17.842 --> 12:19.386
shortage of supplies...

12:20.595 --> 12:22.055
Employees leaving.

12:22.180 --> 12:24.724
Barring extenuating circumstances,

12:24.849 --> 12:28.561
do you agree this route
requires no detours?

12:31.564 --> 12:34.401
Barring extenuating circumstances.

12:34.526 --> 12:37.654
Let the record show Mr. Durant's nod
in the affirmative.

12:37.779 --> 12:41.324
I propose that we take a vote to lock in
the southern route through Salt Lake City

12:41.449 --> 12:44.411
and exclude any detours north,
including the coal fields...

12:45.161 --> 12:46.204
around Ogden.

12:46.329 --> 12:49.249
Central Pacific is ready to lock in
the southern route,

12:49.374 --> 12:51.459
as proposed by the Union Pacific.

12:51.584 --> 12:52.794
Wise decision.

12:52.919 --> 12:55.200
What do you say, Mr. Durant?
Will you make it unanimous?

12:55.505 --> 12:57.841
Excluding Ogden is premature.

12:57.966 --> 12:59.175
Foolhardy.

12:59.509 --> 13:01.011
Could I suggest that we...

13:01.136 --> 13:02.762
Mr. Durant,

13:02.887 --> 13:05.932
Ogden is outside the straightest route.
The southern route.

13:06.057 --> 13:09.102
Building to Ogden would constitute
a waste of federal funds.

13:09.227 --> 13:11.688
A felony for which Mr. Durant

13:11.813 --> 13:14.166
has already served time,
if I'm not mistaken, Mr. President.

13:14.190 --> 13:16.192
Mr. Durant, you have two choices,

13:16.318 --> 13:18.361
go south and forfeit Ogden,

13:18.486 --> 13:20.488
or go north through Ogden.

13:23.033 --> 13:25.327
I want your choice made now.

13:29.873 --> 13:32.208
You force my hand, um...

13:35.670 --> 13:39.341
The Union Pacific will have to go north,
through Ogden.

13:40.050 --> 13:41.885
You lying heathen!

13:44.929 --> 13:47.599
The northern route
has been confirmed.

13:47.724 --> 13:49.267
When we reconvene,

13:49.392 --> 13:54.105
we shall settle on where your two railroads
would join by naming a final terminus.

14:08.870 --> 14:13.375
It's the ease with which you lie
and steal that truly impresses me.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.461
Did you not hear me
fighting for you in there?

14:16.586 --> 14:19.881
For Salt Lake City,
to the point of hoarseness?

14:21.007 --> 14:23.218
The bone you have to pick
is with Cullen Bohannon,

14:23.343 --> 14:25.053
the man who just saw to it

14:25.178 --> 14:27.472
that the Transcontinental Railroad

14:27.597 --> 14:30.433
will bypass your fine, fecund city.

14:30.558 --> 14:34.437
I need you to put Salt Lake City
back on the table.

14:36.606 --> 14:38.608
Give me back your laborers

14:38.733 --> 14:41.152
and I will order the immediate construction

14:41.277 --> 14:45.156
of a glistening spur line
direct to Salt Lake City.

14:45.281 --> 14:47.492
There, your Zion resurrected!

14:47.617 --> 14:50.995
The President's dream
of uniting this country by rail

14:51.121 --> 14:52.914
will crumble to dust

14:53.039 --> 14:55.250
without lumber from Mormon poplars,

14:55.375 --> 14:58.753
sugar from Mormon beets,
flour from Mormon wheat,

14:58.878 --> 15:01.965
and tools forged in Mormon fire.

15:02.090 --> 15:05.802
Brigham, you and I both know

15:05.927 --> 15:07.887
your Zion will die...

15:08.596 --> 15:13.143
without the influx of cash
a contract with me provides.

15:13.268 --> 15:14.811
Now, you have a choice.

15:15.937 --> 15:19.941
You can stomp your feet
like a petulant schoolgirl

15:20.275 --> 15:24.696
or you can join me
in undoing Cullen Bohannon.

15:31.369 --> 15:35.748
Salt Lake City is the terminus
or you can build your railroad alone.

15:52.098 --> 15:53.418
Come. Come, come, come, please.

15:54.601 --> 15:57.145
We propose Fort Bridger

15:57.270 --> 15:59.272
as the final terminus of the railroad.

15:59.397 --> 16:01.941
Edge of Wyoming,
and that fatuous double-dealer,

16:02.066 --> 16:05.487
he won't even make it far enough west
to smell the coal in Ogden.

16:05.612 --> 16:08.732
We ain't even through the Sierras.
Durant will see through it, so will Grant.

16:08.823 --> 16:11.534
Grant's never been to the Sierras,
and Durant neither.

16:11.659 --> 16:14.871
Nobody knows for certain where we are
except you and me.

16:14.996 --> 16:17.165
Put it on the map,
Grant will believe it.

16:23.171 --> 16:25.757
I ain't lying to the President
of the United States.

16:28.510 --> 16:31.137
What's good for the railroad
is good for America.

16:31.262 --> 16:33.264
We are patriots, Mr. Bohannon!

16:36.601 --> 16:38.436
Do you know why I hired you?

16:39.854 --> 16:41.356
To build your railroad.

16:42.106 --> 16:46.069
Yeah, and also because Grant,

16:46.194 --> 16:47.403
that old soldier,

16:47.529 --> 16:49.989
holds you in higher regard
than the rest of us combined.

16:50.448 --> 16:52.242
You call it... a lie.

16:52.367 --> 16:54.035
Call it a battlefield strategy...

16:54.160 --> 16:56.246
But this... this, right here

16:56.371 --> 16:58.623
is the very stuff of your lifetime.

17:00.375 --> 17:02.877
Now you fancy yourself
a railroad man...

17:04.462 --> 17:07.131
Minute you accepted a stake
in the Central Pacific,

17:08.049 --> 17:09.550
you became a tycoon.

17:11.636 --> 17:14.806
And a tycoon always chooses the win...

17:16.891 --> 17:18.643
no matter how he comes by it.

17:25.358 --> 17:27.157
Pretty goddamn sure
of yourself, ain't you?

17:29.195 --> 17:30.738
I am.

17:30.863 --> 17:32.740
It's a well that replenishes.

17:35.034 --> 17:37.203
Time for you to drink
from that same water.

17:38.746 --> 17:40.373
Deliver this for me.

17:49.549 --> 17:50.842
Josie's a whore.

17:52.176 --> 17:53.344
Whores lie.

17:53.469 --> 17:56.149
Well, Josie's running all over you
and all the other girls see it.

17:57.724 --> 17:59.601
She came to me after your job.

18:01.436 --> 18:03.354
She's a nasty piece of work.

18:03.771 --> 18:06.065
Running women is nasty business, sure.

18:06.524 --> 18:09.527
They need to be kept in line.
And you let them away with too much.

18:10.069 --> 18:11.779
My cousin favors the change.

18:18.870 --> 18:20.913
We'd keep a place for you, of course.

18:22.123 --> 18:23.916
Always room for a good whore.

18:26.711 --> 18:28.921
I'll get the money back.

18:31.049 --> 18:32.592
Pray that you do.

18:32.717 --> 18:35.470
And get control of Josie and
the other girls, otherwise...

19:04.165 --> 19:07.377
Your favorite brand, as I recall.

19:07.502 --> 19:09.337
Ain't you got schemes to spin?

19:18.304 --> 19:20.890
You know, it gives me no pleasure

19:21.015 --> 19:23.601
to find us set against
each other, Bohannon.

19:23.935 --> 19:25.895
I'm a little surprised,
I will admit.

19:27.230 --> 19:29.565
Given all your talk of "honor."

19:29.691 --> 19:31.901
I joined the Central Pacific
to find my family.

19:32.026 --> 19:33.528
The Union Pacific
is your family.

19:33.653 --> 19:36.489
It has been since the day
you bust into my rail car

19:36.614 --> 19:38.825
and told me to hire you
instead of hanging you.

19:46.874 --> 19:48.209
You regret your decision?

19:50.461 --> 19:51.838
Not if you come home.

19:54.799 --> 19:59.011
You don't owe that puny
shopkeeper Huntington anything.

20:00.221 --> 20:01.723
He's using you.

20:03.433 --> 20:07.311
He will ask you to misrepresent the
progress of the Central Pacific

20:07.437 --> 20:09.230
to the President of the United States,

20:10.064 --> 20:11.441
if he hasn't already.

20:14.360 --> 20:15.570
It's what I'd do.

20:16.863 --> 20:18.698
But I would never ask you to lie.

20:19.782 --> 20:21.451
Saint that you are.

20:21.576 --> 20:23.828
You can't beat me, Bohannon.

20:24.787 --> 20:29.125
But for some damned reason,
Grant likes you.

20:33.921 --> 20:36.299
You and I have always given
each other an edge.

20:38.134 --> 20:39.302
Join me.

20:40.178 --> 20:45.099
Together we can bury Huntington
and win the coal fields of Ogden.

20:48.853 --> 20:51.022
You are full of surprises,
I give you that.

20:52.315 --> 20:55.485
You told me when I left
that you'd never take me back.

20:56.277 --> 20:58.321
Well, all is forgiven.

20:59.405 --> 21:00.907
Just come home.

21:03.951 --> 21:05.787
Wasn't me who killed Johnson,
you know.

21:06.287 --> 21:07.497
What?

21:07.830 --> 21:11.110
That day I busted into your train car,
you was gonna hang me for killing Johnson.

21:12.043 --> 21:13.628
Was Elam done that, not me.

21:15.296 --> 21:17.298
Um, I don't care who you killed.

21:23.721 --> 21:24.972
I know.

21:27.058 --> 21:29.185
Got a few surprises of my own, is all.

21:49.330 --> 21:50.331
Sir?

21:50.748 --> 21:52.083
You wanted to see me?

21:52.917 --> 21:54.252
Mr. Bohannon...

21:54.752 --> 21:58.130
We are up and running,
bursting with grain and fruit,

21:58.256 --> 22:00.883
bustling with industry,
all ready for export.

22:01.008 --> 22:03.237
Going through Salt Lake City
ain't practical for the railroad.

22:03.261 --> 22:05.805
Grant told me himself
he's willing to consider it.

22:06.973 --> 22:08.391
I come to you heart in hand.

22:08.516 --> 22:11.310
My people, our very way of life
depend upon you.

22:11.435 --> 22:13.688
If you'll just speak to the President.

22:14.188 --> 22:15.690
I know he listens to you.

22:16.357 --> 22:17.775
He's his own man.

22:17.900 --> 22:20.403
At the end of the day,
he'll call it like he sees it.

22:21.988 --> 22:24.049
Well, perhaps my route
has some practical applications

22:24.073 --> 22:25.908
that are escaping you at the moment.

22:27.827 --> 22:29.620
Not long ago,
I received a telegram from you

22:29.745 --> 22:31.289
inquiring about the Hatchites.

22:32.790 --> 22:35.501
I responded that I didn't know
their location.

22:35.835 --> 22:38.296
I did. And I do.

22:39.672 --> 22:41.173
I know exactly where they are.

22:43.426 --> 22:46.262
And you know exactly
what I need from you.

22:47.179 --> 22:50.892
Them gold plates teach you to lie like that,
or was you just born a son-of-a-bitch?

22:54.812 --> 22:56.939
Heavenly Father looks out for me,
Mr. Bohannon,

22:57.064 --> 22:59.066
as I am attempting
to look out for you.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.277
Let my good fortune be yours,

23:01.402 --> 23:03.779
and you shall be reunited
with your loved ones.

23:15.750 --> 23:17.168
Not like that.

23:56.916 --> 23:58.626
Get off Tess' bed, Josie.

23:59.126 --> 24:00.586
- It's my bed...
- Shut it!

24:05.633 --> 24:07.134
Move your ass.

24:07.259 --> 24:08.427
I won't ask again.

24:08.552 --> 24:09.762
Or what?

24:10.638 --> 24:11.931
You'll shoot me?

24:12.056 --> 24:14.392
You dumb enough to find out?

24:20.064 --> 24:22.358
Now you go and get me that money.

24:22.483 --> 24:23.609
I said already...

24:23.734 --> 24:26.070
I don't have it!
Put it in my hand!

24:40.251 --> 24:41.419
(Mucking)

24:54.306 --> 24:55.683
Go pack your things.

24:57.309 --> 24:58.352
Bitch!

25:06.694 --> 25:07.694
You're fired.

25:09.363 --> 25:11.615
- You can't fire her!
- I'm the madam, Tess.

25:12.324 --> 25:13.868
Now, you like her so much,

25:14.535 --> 25:16.245
you go get on that train with her.

25:19.623 --> 25:21.083
Leaves at 10:00 for Cheyenne.

25:32.970 --> 25:34.221
Brother Phineas.

25:35.639 --> 25:38.059
- I had the vision, Brother.
- Tell me.

25:38.517 --> 25:40.686
I was walking through the desert,

25:40.811 --> 25:41.812
with a dagger.

25:41.937 --> 25:44.315
And I came across a lone sheep.
Yes?

25:44.440 --> 25:47.359
Abandoned by his flock.

25:48.527 --> 25:50.529
A sheep with fangs and claws.

25:52.740 --> 25:54.158
But I just...

25:54.992 --> 25:56.702
I just stood there, Brother.

25:57.703 --> 26:00.790
I couldn't... I couldn't move.
I was frozen.

26:00.915 --> 26:03.125
Heavenly Father is telling you

26:03.250 --> 26:05.795
to slaughter the sheep
so that you may wear his wool.

26:06.128 --> 26:09.465
He's calling upon you
to out the unholy sheep's throat!

26:13.260 --> 26:14.470
You're afraid.

26:15.262 --> 26:16.680
I see it, my son.

26:17.264 --> 26:18.641
But fear not,

26:19.475 --> 26:23.145
this holy divination has been bestowed
by Heavenly Father above upon you,

26:23.270 --> 26:24.772
and you alone.

26:27.817 --> 26:29.026
Yes.

26:36.867 --> 26:38.285
My mission is clear.

26:42.790 --> 26:44.792
Yes, my son.

26:47.711 --> 26:49.338
Why are you doing this?

26:49.839 --> 26:50.965
The railroad?

26:52.800 --> 26:55.511
The scars of reconstruction
can't heal until

26:55.636 --> 26:57.763
we link this nation
east to west...

26:57.888 --> 27:00.683
Make it whole again.
You sound like a politician.

27:03.477 --> 27:05.062
I never pictured you as one.

27:07.898 --> 27:09.984
Never pictured it myself.

27:10.568 --> 27:15.114
The last morning I have a clear memory of
is in Appomattox Court House.

27:16.157 --> 27:18.951
Yesterday I was watching
Robert E. Lee surrender.

27:19.076 --> 27:21.662
Today I'm sitting behind a desk
in the White House.

27:22.830 --> 27:25.875
You know, sometimes you can't avoid
the thing you want most,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.502
even if getting it is detestable.

27:28.836 --> 27:30.671
As much as I pretend I hate it,

27:31.505 --> 27:34.592
the detestable thing I want is power,

27:35.843 --> 27:38.137
and power means politics.

27:38.262 --> 27:39.680
What's yours?

27:45.686 --> 27:47.271
I used to know.

27:49.023 --> 27:50.441
Thought I did.

27:51.859 --> 27:54.486
I know two songs, Mr. Bohannon.

27:55.529 --> 27:57.281
<i>One's Yankee Doodle,</i>

27:58.449 --> 27:59.867
and the other one isn't.

28:02.369 --> 28:04.538
Keep things simple,
that's my advice.

28:05.331 --> 28:08.500
The American people don't care
where the two railroads meet up,

28:08.626 --> 28:09.919
only that they do.

28:12.838 --> 28:14.340
Even if it's Salt Lake City?

28:18.219 --> 28:20.721
In politics, nothing
is ever off the table.

28:45.746 --> 28:47.373
Tell me where my family is,

28:47.915 --> 28:49.833
I'll make the case for Salt Lake City.

28:53.921 --> 28:56.799
You'll have their location
the minute the meeting concludes.

28:56.924 --> 28:58.550
Here and now or the deal's off.

29:00.469 --> 29:04.139
I walk out that door,
don't bother coming to the meeting.

29:04.265 --> 29:07.434
Time she's finished, you won't even be able
to find Salt Lake City on a map.

29:11.772 --> 29:12.815
Fair enough.

29:12.940 --> 29:14.441
Mr. Bohannon.

29:35.754 --> 29:38.173
The railroad goes south through the city.

29:42.303 --> 29:43.804
You have my word.

30:03.991 --> 30:05.868
You found me in a pile of pig shit...

30:05.993 --> 30:07.161
That's true.

30:07.953 --> 30:11.373
I was starving and lonely
and lower than low.

30:11.957 --> 30:14.001
But it was better than
where I come from.

30:15.502 --> 30:17.713
I can't go back.

30:17.838 --> 30:19.048
Josie.

30:19.173 --> 30:20.841
I went to the station, Eva.

30:21.467 --> 30:22.801
I did.

30:23.510 --> 30:24.845
But then I thought,

30:25.846 --> 30:27.681
why should I be the one to leave?

30:28.974 --> 30:31.852
- I can't have you here.
- Well, I ain't going.

30:32.853 --> 30:34.021
You are.

30:35.981 --> 30:37.900
(gunsnon

30:48.494 --> 30:49.870
Josie, no!

31:23.779 --> 31:25.447
Clean up this mess now, girl.

31:34.373 --> 31:35.374
Josie...

31:43.132 --> 31:44.967
We're gonna need a new redhead.

31:48.303 --> 31:49.763
All right, sit down!

31:49.888 --> 31:53.142
John, sit down!

31:58.772 --> 32:00.524
You cost me a lot of money there, Eva.

32:00.649 --> 32:02.151
Customers' favorite, Josie.

32:02.818 --> 32:04.361
It was my decision to make.

32:10.492 --> 32:11.660
It was.

32:21.712 --> 32:23.005
Now, get yourself cleaned up,

32:24.006 --> 32:25.215
and get back to work.

32:42.274 --> 32:43.775
Now, under my compass,

32:43.901 --> 32:49.448
the Union Pacific has laid
987 miles of tracks

32:49.573 --> 32:51.408
across four states,

32:51.533 --> 32:54.786
using half the amount of money,

32:54.912 --> 32:58.248
work force, and supplies
as the Central Pacific.

32:59.124 --> 33:01.710
The Union Pacific would like to propose

33:01.835 --> 33:05.255
the naming of Promontory, Utah,

33:05.380 --> 33:10.886
385 miles west of Laramie, Wyoming,

33:11.553 --> 33:13.096
as our terminus.

33:13.514 --> 33:15.432
At three miles a day,

33:15.557 --> 33:19.561
we will be there in less
than 130 days from today.

33:19.686 --> 33:22.356
Thank you, Mr. Durant.
Mr. Huntington?

33:23.774 --> 33:27.569
Mr. President, if it pleases you,
I'd like my partner,

33:27.694 --> 33:29.363
to deliver our case.

33:38.539 --> 33:40.123
The Central Pacific
will not be naming.

33:40.249 --> 33:42.334
Fort Bridger
as the final terminus here today.

33:43.168 --> 33:45.879
Mr. Durant spoke true when he said

33:46.004 --> 33:48.590
such a proposal
would be outside our capabilities.

33:50.175 --> 33:52.803
But he is mistaken

33:52.928 --> 33:55.764
in naming Promontory
as the proper terminus of this road.

33:57.891 --> 34:01.270
Central Pacific wishes to propose
a more radical alternative,

34:01.395 --> 34:03.456
one which has been considered
but not fully discussed

34:03.480 --> 34:05.941
by the men in this room
over the last couple days.

34:08.610 --> 34:10.070
We propose no terminus at all.

34:10.195 --> 34:11.362
Mr. Bohannon, I...

34:11.487 --> 34:14.032
But that both railroads
follow the agreed upon northern route,

34:14.157 --> 34:15.742
bypassing Salt Lake City,

34:15.867 --> 34:19.288
the point to be determined by the speed
with which each railroad builds.

34:19.413 --> 34:21.248
Godless bastard!

34:21.623 --> 34:24.042
I second Mr. Young's objections!

34:24.167 --> 34:27.795
Mr. Bohannon, the purpose of this meeting
was to set a final terminus.

34:27.920 --> 34:29.255
Mr. President,

34:30.841 --> 34:34.177
not long ago,
I took a train ride after a long war.

34:35.929 --> 34:38.514
And today, I sit here, in this room,

34:38.639 --> 34:41.059
a stakeholder
in the Central Pacific Railroad.

34:41.184 --> 34:43.020
And make no mistake about it,

34:43.145 --> 34:45.813
the other men in this room
are driven by self-interest and greed.

34:45.938 --> 34:48.025
Greed for the coalfields in Ogden.

34:49.318 --> 34:50.920
But Ogden's riches shouldn't go to the man

34:50.944 --> 34:53.280
with the best speech
or the most devious lie.

34:57.034 --> 35:01.288
This contest hadn't ought to end in a room.

35:03.457 --> 35:05.459
Ogden should go to the man
who gets there first.

35:07.252 --> 35:08.503
You said it yourself...

35:09.796 --> 35:11.590
Nothing's ever off the table.

35:24.978 --> 35:26.146
You want a race?

35:34.655 --> 35:36.990
Yeah... Yeah, I want a race.

35:39.493 --> 35:41.161
Then, Mr. Bohannon,

35:42.120 --> 35:43.372
you shall have a race.

35:48.543 --> 35:50.879
I would be within reason to fire you.

35:53.590 --> 35:55.384
Not if you aim to win this race.

36:01.556 --> 36:03.392
Get us through that tunnel quick.

36:04.935 --> 36:06.144
Thomas, as always...

36:06.269 --> 36:07.270
No.

36:07.896 --> 36:10.941
Collie, you don't stand a chance.
I think I do.

36:19.825 --> 36:23.203
You know, starting a race
from behind a granite wall

36:23.328 --> 36:25.789
is not going to make
for a very exciting finish.

36:26.998 --> 36:30.085
I was hoping for more of a fight from you.

36:31.128 --> 36:33.088
You've been an advocate of mine, Doc,

36:34.047 --> 36:36.341
but if you aim to beat me,
you should've ended this race

36:36.466 --> 36:38.986
where you stood a chance of winning it,
right here in this room.

36:39.094 --> 36:41.214
The race we start tomorrow
will be decided in the mud.

36:41.304 --> 36:43.932
Hell, I've...
I was born in the mud.

36:44.850 --> 36:46.435
Tore a farm out of that mud.

36:48.061 --> 36:49.396
Built an army out of more mud.

36:50.147 --> 36:52.607
Failure stacked atop failure.

37:01.658 --> 37:03.618
In one month,
I'll punch through the Sierras.

37:03.744 --> 37:05.662
In two months,
I'll be across Nevada.

37:06.204 --> 37:08.540
By year end, both railroads
will be at the Utah state line,

37:08.665 --> 37:10.876
and the last place you want to see me

37:11.001 --> 37:12.961
is at rail end building in your direction.

37:15.046 --> 37:16.882
Don't fool yourself, Bohannon.

37:17.758 --> 37:20.761
The coal fields of Ogden will be mine.

37:29.269 --> 37:30.645
We will see.

37:34.483 --> 37:35.483
Mr. Bohannon.

37:47.120 --> 37:49.915
- Father.
- Another time, Phineas.

38:01.009 --> 38:02.594
Why did you never read to me?

38:09.518 --> 38:11.311
This is the question you ask?

38:16.399 --> 38:19.861
Now? When I'm fighting
for the life of my holy city,

38:19.986 --> 38:24.324
for the very life of my flock!
It is not your flock anymore, Father!

38:25.534 --> 38:26.701
It's mine.

39:13.373 --> 39:15.208
Beautiful day?

39:15.333 --> 39:17.669
Made with love. Yeah?

39:17.794 --> 39:19.629
The Prophet has fallen!

39:23.758 --> 39:26.845
Brigham Young, the False Prophet,

39:27.262 --> 39:29.848
who led us away from God's path.

39:29.973 --> 39:31.975
But fear not, brothers,

39:32.100 --> 39:34.603
for I am he who replaces him.

39:35.604 --> 39:37.314
The True Prophet.

39:38.648 --> 39:41.735
Heavenly Father has anointed me,

39:41.860 --> 39:45.071
Phineas Young,
to his earthly throne.

39:46.698 --> 39:48.325
And...

39:51.369 --> 39:52.954
Traitor!

39:57.334 --> 40:00.045
My sometime son!

40:04.132 --> 40:06.092
He very nearly took my life.

40:06.593 --> 40:08.386
But Heavenly Father...

40:10.931 --> 40:14.100
spared me through his mercy.

40:17.270 --> 40:19.397
My friend. My friend.

40:21.316 --> 40:23.693
You stay. You stay, yeah?

40:44.673 --> 40:45.799
Brother Cassius!

40:46.800 --> 40:49.552
It's your father, hurry.
He's been stabbed.

41:02.482 --> 41:03.692
Father!

41:04.484 --> 41:06.861
It was Gundersen.
He planned this!

41:06.987 --> 41:08.363
Thor Gundersen's the man you want!

41:10.323 --> 41:11.700
He's already gone.

41:13.368 --> 41:14.703
Find him.

41:15.829 --> 41:17.706
Find him, my son.

41:21.459 --> 41:24.921
This morning,
Phineas asked about a heretic sect,

41:25.046 --> 41:26.673
their location...

41:39.352 --> 41:42.647
Come here!

41:43.305 --> 41:49.188
