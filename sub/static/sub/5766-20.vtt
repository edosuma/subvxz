WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:02.995
(birds chirping)

00:14.810 --> 00:16.505
Can we do this later, Eli?

00:16.550 --> 00:18.700
I'm sorry I'm late;
traffic was crazy.

00:18.750 --> 00:20.411
Peter wanted me
to check out this house

00:20.450 --> 00:22.111
on my way in to work,
so, please?

00:22.150 --> 00:23.185
ELI: _
No, wait.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.438
I just wanted to warn you:
the press might call.

00:25.490 --> 00:27.378
Wendy Scott-Carr's husband
is doing

00:27.420 --> 00:29.820
his spousal interview with kids.

00:29.860 --> 00:31.452
We discussed this, Eli;
I'm not gonna do an interview.

00:31.490 --> 00:32.627
I know.
I-I didn't say anything.

00:32.660 --> 00:34.355
I'm just saying,
you might get a call.

00:34.400 --> 00:35.389
I'm going now.

00:35.430 --> 00:36.397
No, wait.

00:36.430 --> 00:37.465
You and the kids are coming

00:37.500 --> 00:39.161
to the Hyra tomorrow night
for the returns, right?

00:39.200 --> 00:40.462
I am.
Not the kids?

00:40.500 --> 00:41.797
Good-bye, Eli.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.398
(phone beeps)

00:45.410 --> 00:47.378
It's a four-bedroom,
five-and-a-half-bath

00:47.410 --> 00:49.742
1933 Colonial
Revival.

00:49.780 --> 00:52.476
Stanley Myers
interior.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.374
Beautiful,
isn't it?

00:54.420 --> 00:55.648
It is.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.614
You have to see the
formal dInIng room.

00:57.650 --> 00:58.844
Original
hardwood floors.

00:58.890 --> 01:03.224
2.4 million, but I'm pretty
sure I can get them down to 2.1.

01:03.260 --> 01:05.478
It's a quiet neighborhood,
close to very good schools,

01:05.530 --> 01:07.452
public and private.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.389
It's a divorce, so
they're very motivated.

01:10.430 --> 01:12.694
So the vote's
tomorrow, huh?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.662
Mrs. State's Attorney.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.304
Sorry, is that
jinxing it?

01:16.340 --> 01:17.307
(cell phone ringing)

01:17.340 --> 01:18.705
Excuse me a moment.

01:18.740 --> 01:19.832
Alicia Florrick.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.279
ANDREW:
Mrs. Florrick, hello.

01:21.310 --> 01:22.846
This is Andrew Wiley.
I'm an investigator

01:22.880 --> 01:24.302
with the
State's Attorney's Office.

01:24.350 --> 01:25.578
I'm a little busy, Mr...

01:25.610 --> 01:26.577
Wiley.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.575
I won't keep you.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.110
I just need to ask you

01:29.150 --> 01:30.617
a few questions
about my investigation.

01:30.650 --> 01:33.551
I was told that investigation
was concluded, Mr. Wiley.

01:33.590 --> 01:36.354
Yeah, well, the Kalinda Sharma
investigation was concluded.

01:36.390 --> 01:37.652
This is a new one.

01:37.690 --> 01:38.884
Uh, when can we talk?

01:38.930 --> 01:39.897
(phone beeps)
Well, I'm...

01:39.930 --> 01:41.420
That's my call-waiting.

01:41.460 --> 01:42.825
Why don't you-- I'll have
my assistant call.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.360
Okay. When?

01:44.400 --> 01:45.492
Soon.

01:45.530 --> 01:46.531
(phone beeps)

01:46.570 --> 01:47.537
Alicia Florrick.

01:47.570 --> 01:48.537
Hello, Mrs. Florrick.

01:48.570 --> 01:50.606
Uh, it's Natalie Flores.

01:50.640 --> 01:53.507
Um, I'm the intern
you hired for the month.

01:53.540 --> 01:55.576
The one with the immigration
trouble who worked

01:55.610 --> 01:58.704
as a nanny for Wendy Scott-Carr
and-and was fired after...

01:58.750 --> 02:00.672
I know, Natalie. What's up?

02:00.720 --> 02:02.745
Your husband wanted you
to look at the study.

02:02.790 --> 02:03.745
Through there.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.417
Maybe nothing. Uh, or something.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.348
Look, Natalie,
I'm a little busy.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.152
I'm sorry.

02:10.190 --> 02:11.919
Uh, th-this contract
you asked me

02:11.960 --> 02:15.452
to translate for the deposition
today-- I was looking at

02:15.500 --> 02:16.626
the 2007 extension...

02:16.670 --> 02:18.297
It's not the extension.

02:18.330 --> 02:19.729
We already had that translated.

02:19.770 --> 02:21.829
I wanted
the side letter translated.

02:21.870 --> 02:24.236
Never mind. Um, I'll just wait
till you get here.

02:24.270 --> 02:25.237
It's probably nothing.

02:27.380 --> 02:29.177
It's been a crazy morning.
What is it?

02:29.210 --> 02:32.247
Well, I-I know
I'm just an intern here,

02:32.280 --> 02:34.316
and I really don't want
to get anyone in trouble,

02:34.350 --> 02:38.639
but I think your translator
mistranslated it.

02:38.690 --> 02:39.657
(phone beeps)

02:39.690 --> 02:41.248
That's my call-waiting.

02:41.290 --> 02:42.382
I'll be right in.

02:42.430 --> 02:43.454
(phone beeps)

02:43.490 --> 02:44.559
Alicia Florrick.

02:44.590 --> 02:45.818
Alicia, sorry to
bother you at home,

02:45.860 --> 02:47.589
but can you come in early?
We have a problem.

02:47.630 --> 02:48.722
Sure.

02:48.760 --> 02:49.590
The deposition?

02:49.630 --> 02:51.689
No, the client.
He had a heart attack.

02:51.730 --> 02:53.630
What?!

02:53.670 --> 02:54.694
His daughter's here--

02:54.740 --> 02:55.798
Aida.

02:55.840 --> 02:56.966
Oh, my God.

02:57.010 --> 02:57.965
VVhen?

02:58.010 --> 02:59.477
Last night.

02:59.510 --> 03:01.501
She says he's conscious;
he's out of the ICU,

03:01.540 --> 03:03.542
but he wants us to continue
with the depositions.

03:03.580 --> 03:04.877
He want...? How?

03:04.910 --> 03:06.309
That's what we're trying

03:06.350 --> 03:07.374
to figure out now.

03:07.420 --> 03:08.478
So can you come in?

03:08.520 --> 03:11.239
Sure. Her father always said
this was a cursed suit.

03:11.290 --> 03:12.416
Eh, there's no such thing.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.518
But don't say it,

03:13.560 --> 03:14.959
because it's unlucky.

03:14.990 --> 03:17.458
I'll see you in 20 minutes.

03:17.490 --> 03:18.821
(phone beeps)

03:18.860 --> 03:19.827
(sighs)

03:19.860 --> 03:21.521
I thought of you.

03:21.560 --> 03:22.697
It's like your old house.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.530
You ever miss it?

03:28.570 --> 03:30.538
My old house?

03:30.570 --> 03:31.832
Sometimes.

03:31.870 --> 03:34.998
Well, this one is better.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.009
(chuckles softly)

03:38.050 --> 03:39.472
I have to go.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.475
(sighs)

03:40.520 --> 03:41.976
You haven't even
seen upstairs.

03:42.020 --> 03:44.488
I'll come back.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.556
It is tempting.

03:46.590 --> 03:47.887
What's wrong with
being tempted?

03:47.920 --> 03:48.887
(chuckles)

03:48.920 --> 03:50.421
SPENCER:
It was hard.

03:50.460 --> 03:51.381
I won't lie.

03:51.430 --> 03:54.729
These flyers tried to
make our love ugly.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.422
And then our daughters were
the ones to bring them home.

03:57.470 --> 03:59.438
Did it make you cry, Elisa?

03:59.470 --> 04:01.597
ELISA:
Yeah, I guess,

04:01.640 --> 04:03.699
but Mom and Dad
explained it to me.

04:03.740 --> 04:05.662
Oh, my God, we're screwed.

04:05.710 --> 04:07.803
You've had a strong marriage
for over decade now, Spencer.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.478
What do you think
of the troubles

04:09.510 --> 04:10.477
in the Florrick marriage?

04:10.510 --> 04:11.408
Oh, dear God Almighty.

04:11.450 --> 04:12.712
I think any marriage
that stays together

04:12.750 --> 04:14.843
is to be respected,
admired.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.745
Every marriage
needs some space.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.678
We got to do some polling.
No.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.585
We got to get Florrick's wife
to do the interview.

04:20.620 --> 04:21.359
She won't.
I don't think

04:21.390 --> 04:23.449
you get it, Eli.
Or she doesn't.

04:23.490 --> 04:25.321
You're in a race that's tied
With one day to go,

04:25.360 --> 04:26.850
and he just hit a home run
for his wife.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.027
Alicia Florrick doesn't have the
luxury to say no, and you don't

04:29.060 --> 04:30.459
have the luxury to protect her.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.967
I'm not protecting her.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.468
I promised her I would not
ask her to do this.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.468
Oh, my God, you
promised her.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.466
Well, why didn't
you just say that?

04:38.510 --> 04:39.534
NATALIE:
I'll be ready

04:39.580 --> 04:40.535
in a minute, Andre.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.445
I have to get this
to my boss.

04:42.480 --> 04:43.879
We have better
health care, too.

04:43.910 --> 04:45.969
Canada has the best
health care in the world.

04:46.010 --> 04:47.546
I like it here, Andre.

04:47.580 --> 04:49.070
I like the US.
I'll be right back.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.485
Just come look
at Montreal.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.556
America is dying!

04:52.590 --> 04:54.387
Hi.
Hi. Show me as we walk.

04:54.420 --> 04:55.557
They do bilingual
contracts--

04:55.590 --> 04:57.319
one in English,
one in Spanish.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.486
They're supposed
to be identical.

04:58.530 --> 04:59.497
Okay.

04:59.530 --> 05:00.758
But they're not. Look.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.051
AIDA:
Alicia.
Then, on page five...

05:02.100 --> 05:04.819
ALICIA:
Aida.

05:04.870 --> 05:05.825
He's all right.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.428
What happened?

05:07.470 --> 05:09.358
He was looking through
their stock reports,

05:09.410 --> 05:11.002
trying to find things
to refute them.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.634
And then I told him
that he should stop,

05:13.680 --> 05:14.829
that he should
rest for today.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.802
And then he just blacked out.

05:16.850 --> 05:17.805
I drove him to
the hospital.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.841
Well, you should
be there with him, Aida.
No.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.745
He insisted I be here
in his place.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.338
He wants me to phone him

05:23.390 --> 05:24.948
every hour,
with updates.

05:24.990 --> 05:27.550
This isn't just about the
money anymore, Alicia.

05:27.590 --> 05:29.729
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.580
Natalie Flores.
This is Aida Rios.

05:31.630 --> 05:32.551
Oh, hello.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.897
(cell phone ringing)

05:33.930 --> 05:35.352
Excuse me.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.469
Hello?

05:36.500 --> 05:38.764
Can you stay
for the rest of the day?

05:38.800 --> 05:40.392
Me?
Yes.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.691
Um...

05:41.740 --> 05:43.560
You know what, just show
this to a paralegal.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.566
Um, no, no, no,
H can stay.

05:45.610 --> 05:47.578
I just, I just have
to tell my boyfriend.

05:47.610 --> 05:48.599
Great.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.099
Aida, I'm so sorry.

05:52.150 --> 05:53.674
Your dad is
a tough old cuss.

05:53.720 --> 05:54.914
He'll be up and around
in no time.

05:54.950 --> 05:56.645
Thank you.
WILL:
And thank you,

05:56.690 --> 05:58.009
Mr. Francis, for agreeing

05:58.050 --> 05:59.517
to be deposed.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.915
After a year,
I thought we'd never see you.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.781
Then perhaps you should use
your time more fruitfully.

06:04.830 --> 06:06.752
Thank you, Isabel.
So your company,

06:06.800 --> 06:09.462
PlatacoStillman, made
how much in profits

06:09.500 --> 06:11.024
last year,
Mr. Francis?

06:11.070 --> 06:13.664
Domestic and worldwide:
6.7 billion.

06:13.700 --> 06:14.769
Wow! Whoof!

06:14.800 --> 06:16.631
The oil business
is proving to be

06:16.670 --> 06:18.558
quite lucrative
these days, huh?

06:18.610 --> 06:21.773
And how much did you pay
Luis Rios and his company,

06:21.810 --> 06:23.141
Latin Star Drilling?

06:23.180 --> 06:26.911
I think you can read
the documents, Mr. Gardner.

06:26.950 --> 06:28.770
You're right,
Isabel, I can.

06:28.820 --> 06:31.414
Zero.

06:31.450 --> 06:34.749
And how much did the contract
specify you owed my client?

06:34.790 --> 06:35.711
If Latin Star Drilling

06:35.760 --> 06:38.627
fulfilled its contractual
duties-- 86 million.

06:38.660 --> 06:41.128
And what were the contractual
duties of Aida's father?

06:41.160 --> 06:43.663
The contractual duties
of Latin Star Drilling

06:43.700 --> 06:46.635
were to set up and operate
oil rigs in Venezuela.

06:47.970 --> 06:51.565
His company promised
to deliver in May 2008,

06:51.610 --> 06:52.702
they delivered in September.

06:52.740 --> 06:53.729
Four months late?

06:53.780 --> 06:55.031
That's correct.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.707
Now, your Brazilian
facility manager

06:56.750 --> 06:58.706
finished his rig
eight months late.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.719
Nigerian contractor
finished a year late.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.638
And yet...
you paid both.

07:03.690 --> 07:04.714
Yes.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.684
We had agreements
allowing for a late delivery.

07:06.720 --> 07:07.687
Agreements? Good.

07:07.720 --> 07:08.652
Where are they?

07:08.690 --> 07:09.725
Handshake agreements.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.490
(laughing)

07:12.530 --> 07:14.691
Oh, I-I thought you were joking.

07:14.730 --> 07:16.664
Didn't the reason you refused
to pay Aida's father...

07:16.700 --> 07:17.519
No, stay for this.

07:17.570 --> 07:19.595
...have nothing to do
with the contract

07:19.640 --> 07:20.595
and everything
to do with

07:20.640 --> 07:22.631
the changing political
climate in Venezuela?

07:22.670 --> 07:23.637
FRANCIS:
No.

07:23.670 --> 07:25.535
WILL:
But you closed your offices

07:25.570 --> 07:28.107
in Caracas in 2008,
claiming

07:28.140 --> 07:31.803
"the socialist policies of the
current President, Hugo Chavez,

07:31.850 --> 07:34.648
have proven unfriendly
to American businesses."

07:34.680 --> 07:36.614
And one week later,

07:36.650 --> 07:37.742
you refused to pay my client's

07:37.790 --> 07:39.109
Venezuelan subsidiary.

07:39.150 --> 07:40.617
Now, it looks to me

07:40.660 --> 07:43.151
like you wanted
to get out of Venezuela,

07:43.190 --> 07:45.021
and you decided
to skip on the bill.

07:45.060 --> 07:45.958
"Looks to me"?

07:45.990 --> 07:48.151
Is that one of those
new-fangled legal terms?

07:48.200 --> 07:50.259
Mr. Francis,
the contracts with our client

07:50.300 --> 07:52.837
were executed in both Spanish
and English; is that correct?

07:52.870 --> 07:53.734
It is.

07:53.770 --> 07:55.692
ALICIA: You speak
Spanish, don't you, sir?

07:55.740 --> 07:56.809
FRANCIS:
I do, fluently.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.637
Um, what does
the word

07:58.670 --> 07:59.807
"exito" mean?

07:59.840 --> 08:00.932
It means "success."

08:00.980 --> 08:03.505
And yet it is often
mistranslated

08:03.550 --> 08:04.778
as "exit," isn't it?

08:04.810 --> 08:06.812
And "exit" is sometimes

08:06.850 --> 08:09.683
mistranslated
as "exrto."

08:09.720 --> 08:11.210
Probably because both words

08:11.250 --> 08:12.615
sound so alike.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.786
Thank you, Rosetta Stone.

08:13.820 --> 08:15.185
What do you have?

08:15.220 --> 08:18.678
Here, in the US. copy,
it reads "exit strategy."

08:18.730 --> 08:19.651
And here,

08:19.700 --> 08:22.055
in the supposedly
identical Spanish copy,

08:22.100 --> 08:24.193
"exit strategy"
is translated

08:24.230 --> 08:28.599
as "estrategia de exito"--
"success strategy."

08:28.640 --> 08:29.732
That is such utter b...!

08:29.770 --> 08:31.806
The delivery side-letter
is now void because our client

08:31.840 --> 08:34.832
never agreed to the terms of
your "exit" delivery date.

08:34.880 --> 08:35.835
That is a technicality!

08:35.880 --> 08:37.541
He knew what he was signing!

08:37.580 --> 08:38.877
Okay.

08:38.910 --> 08:40.878
Okay.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.888
Give us an hour.

08:43.920 --> 08:45.683
Dadlaughed.

08:45.720 --> 08:46.550
He was sitting up in bed.

08:46.590 --> 08:48.649
He knows we still
have a long haul?

08:48.690 --> 08:49.884
He does.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.557
It's just the first time
I've heard him laugh

08:51.590 --> 08:53.228
in a long time.
Good job, Alicia.

08:53.260 --> 08:54.727
Actually, it was...

08:54.760 --> 08:55.749
(laughter, murmuring)

08:55.800 --> 08:58.860
(indistinct conversation)

08:58.900 --> 08:59.889
What's going on?

09:03.640 --> 09:05.904
You know, politics is just
as challenging as acting.

09:05.940 --> 09:07.771
Always has been.

09:07.810 --> 09:09.300
What's really hard
is fly-fishing.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.307
(laughter)

09:10.350 --> 09:12.671
Well, hello there.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.778
You must be, uh...

09:13.820 --> 09:15.617
Will Gardner.
Right, right.

09:15.650 --> 09:17.288
Glad to meet you.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.685
Gardner/Lockhart.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.950
Actually, it's Lockhart/Gardner.

09:20.990 --> 09:22.309
Are you here to see Diane?

09:22.360 --> 09:24.248
Uh, no. Here to see you.

09:24.290 --> 09:26.155
Me? Really?

09:26.190 --> 09:28.920
Well...

09:28.960 --> 09:29.927
I'm here.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.267
(both laughing)

09:33.670 --> 09:34.762
(sighs)

09:34.800 --> 09:36.939
Why are you here to see me?

09:36.970 --> 09:39.939
Well, I hate to say it, Will,
but, uh, I'm replacing you.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.175
The PlatacoStillman suit.

09:42.210 --> 09:44.201
I'm the new
plaintiff's attorney.

09:47.350 --> 09:48.817
Aida, what's going on?

09:48.850 --> 09:50.147
Your dad's firing me?

09:50.190 --> 09:52.385
What?
He's hired an actor?

09:52.420 --> 09:54.809
I'm not just an actor, Will.

09:54.860 --> 09:55.952
I practiced law
for 42 years.

09:55.990 --> 09:57.252
Just like that, he's firing me?

09:57.290 --> 09:58.882
THOMAS: He's not
firing you, Will.

09:58.930 --> 10:00.124
He's no longer the plaintiff.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.628
Over here, boys.

10:02.670 --> 10:05.059
This is the Consul General
of Venezuela.

10:05.100 --> 10:08.866
And this is, uh, somebody else--
can't remember his name.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.162
But, uh, they're
representative

10:10.210 --> 10:12.064
of the Venezuelan
oil industry.

10:12.110 --> 10:16.843
And your client's oil facility
has just been nationalized.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.745
Oh, no.
Sorry to have
to do this,

10:18.780 --> 10:20.839
but, you know, Venezuela
is a socialist country,

10:20.880 --> 10:22.882
and they've just nationalized

10:22.920 --> 10:25.343
Latin Star's
drilling subsidiary.

10:25.390 --> 10:28.086
So that means you're no
longer the plaintiff, ma'am,

10:28.120 --> 10:30.429
and you're no longer the
plaintiff's counsel.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.052
They are,

10:32.090 --> 10:33.421
and I am.

10:33.460 --> 10:34.950
So thank you very much.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.149
We'll take over from here.

10:36.200 --> 10:40.159
Not to sound too melodramatic...

10:40.200 --> 10:42.760
but over my dead body.

10:42.810 --> 10:46.166
Well, not to sound
equally melodramatic,

10:46.210 --> 10:49.202
but, uh, let's dance.

11:02.460 --> 11:03.950
You don't understand.
They pulled within a point,

11:03.990 --> 11:05.423
and that's within
the margin of error.

11:05.460 --> 11:06.722
No, y don't understand.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.398
We just went from a case
we were winning

11:08.430 --> 11:09.829
_maw%
that Isn't even ours.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.088
I know, and I told you
I would never ask you

11:12.130 --> 11:13.267
to do an o_n-screen
InterVIew.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.359
And for nine months,
I haven't,

11:15.400 --> 11:18.437
but we need you.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.801
Peter needs you.

11:19.840 --> 11:22.104
To ask once is still to ask.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.199
I know, but I promise
I'll never ask again and...

11:24.250 --> 11:25.171
because the election
IS tomorrow,

11:25.210 --> 11:27.440
and so even if I wanted to,
there isn't time.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.313
Wendy Scott-Carr's husband
did the spousal interview,

11:30.350 --> 11:32.113
and now they have
the momentum.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.981
And it's not just about him
giving the interview.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.248
It's about you not.

11:35.290 --> 11:37.429
Don't put this
on my shoulders, Eli.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.189
It is on your
shoulders.

11:39.230 --> 11:41.118
Peter's indiscretions
are out front

11:41.160 --> 11:42.320
because you won't speak.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.499
I agreed to leave you
out of the politics

11:44.530 --> 11:46.020
because you didn't
want to comment,

11:48.400 --> 11:49.492
That's not fair.

11:49.540 --> 11:51.007
Of course,
it's not fair.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.406
Politics is not fair.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.805
ELI: Is that...?
ALICIA: Yes.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.307
Why....?

11:57.350 --> 11:59.238
Do you really
want to know?

11:59.280 --> 12:02.943
Alicia, you... you don't want
to think three days from now

12:02.990 --> 12:04.389
that you cost Peter
the election.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.752
Wow. You are really
laying it on.

12:07.790 --> 12:09.382
I believe in Peter.

12:09.420 --> 12:11.422
Peter will be better
than Wendy Scott-Carr.

12:11.460 --> 12:13.348
Why?

12:13.400 --> 12:16.449
Because she is more idealistic
than practical,

12:16.500 --> 12:19.492
and the world chews up
idealistic people.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.532
Peter will not
be chewed up.

12:21.570 --> 12:24.459
All I need is two hours
this afternoon. That's all.

12:24.510 --> 12:27.308
Eli, even if I
wanted to, I work.

12:27.340 --> 12:29.399
This case has been
bubbling along for a year.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.408
It's here.
I can't abandon it--

12:31.450 --> 12:33.475
especially when the client
is in the hospital

12:33.520 --> 12:35.841
_ and Venezuela_
IS trying to steal It.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.939
I'm sorry.

12:43.190 --> 12:45.055
Hi.

12:45.090 --> 12:46.990
Hi. How are you
doing here?

12:47.030 --> 12:48.520
Good. I love Alicia.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.562
Thank you for
making this work.
Oh, no.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.398
They're the ones who needed you.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.566
How's your father doing?

12:54.600 --> 12:56.534
He's working on
his citizenship.

12:56.570 --> 12:58.561
Uh, we're testing
each other.

12:58.610 --> 13:00.475
Did you know there
are 27 amendments

13:00.510 --> 13:02.068
to the Constitution?

13:02.110 --> 13:04.203
I did hear something about it.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.399
NATALIE:
Uh, I have to go.

13:06.450 --> 13:07.542
Oh. Come tomorrow night.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.275
We're having a party
for the candidate--

13:09.320 --> 13:10.344
if we win, I mean.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.813
I don't think that's
a good idea, but thank you.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.959
I have to work.

13:15.990 --> 13:17.321
I'll see you tonight?

13:23.330 --> 13:26.265
So you are Mr. Gold?

13:27.500 --> 13:28.967
Do I know you?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.467
I am Andre.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.329
I'm Natalie's boyfriend.

13:31.370 --> 13:34.032
She said she met
a Mr. Gold. That is you?

13:34.080 --> 13:36.469
Yes. It is me.

13:37.610 --> 13:39.840
We're in love.
Okay.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.518
You're older than she is.

13:42.550 --> 13:44.381
Am I missing
something here?

13:44.420 --> 13:45.444
I'm just talking.

13:45.490 --> 13:47.412
That's all.
And I'm going.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.882
DIANE:
This is absurd.

13:51.260 --> 13:54.320
They nationalized Latin Star's
Venezuelan subsidiary,

13:54.360 --> 13:55.520
so they claim they
have the case.

13:55.560 --> 13:56.925
AIDA:
Should I tell my dad?

13:56.970 --> 13:58.597
I'm just worried
how he'll react.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.461
I wouldn't yet. It's not
certain they can do this.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.637
And our options?

14:01.670 --> 14:03.206
We fight it--
federal court.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.208
Or we delay it.
How?

14:05.240 --> 14:08.004
Natalie?

14:09.240 --> 14:11.606
Go ahead.

14:11.650 --> 14:12.878
(clears throat)

14:12.920 --> 14:15.616
Uh, I... well,
the thing is, um,

14:15.650 --> 14:19.040
Hugo Chavez tried to
nationalize CEMEX,

14:19.090 --> 14:20.955
a Venezuelan
cement company,

14:20.990 --> 14:22.480
but they sued
successfully

14:22.520 --> 14:25.887
for a delay to have a
fair market value assessed.

14:25.930 --> 14:28.490
Okay, and how do we know this?

14:28.530 --> 14:30.293
NATALIE: Well, when
I shorted CEMEX

14:30.330 --> 14:32.969
on the Caracas Exchange,
I took a bath.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.592
Won't be doing that again.

14:37.140 --> 14:38.960
I'm sorry.
Who are you again?

14:39.010 --> 14:40.238
Natalie Flores.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.272
You hired me as a temp, but I
was a day trader before that,

14:43.310 --> 14:45.301
so if you ever want me
to manage your money...

14:46.650 --> 14:48.413
That was a joke.

14:48.450 --> 14:50.680
Not the part about
the day-trading-- that was real.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.483
DIANE: We hired Natalie
for a few weeks

14:52.520 --> 14:54.078
to help her
with her citizenship.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.350
Tell them about CEMEX--
what the assessment did.

14:56.390 --> 14:58.221
NATALIE: Right.
Well, it bought CEMEX time.

14:58.260 --> 15:01.229
Time to bargain
for a better deal.

15:01.260 --> 15:02.989
DIANE:
So we delay

15:03.030 --> 15:04.463
and try to make a deal
with PlatacoStillman?

15:04.500 --> 15:05.660
WILL:
Makes sense.

15:05.700 --> 15:08.635
They'd rather make a deal
with us than Hugo Chavez anyway.

15:09.670 --> 15:11.001
Good job.

15:13.610 --> 15:15.305
Uh, Mrs. Florrick,
Andrew Wiley.

15:15.340 --> 15:16.602
Oh, yes.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.699
My assistant was going
to give you a call.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.377
Yeah, I decided to
save her the trouble.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.444
Well, I'm a little busy.

15:21.480 --> 15:22.981
Um, just quickly, ma'am.

15:23.020 --> 15:24.612
I-I-I'm not here
for Childs.

15:24.650 --> 15:26.049
I-I'm... I'm
following up

15:26.090 --> 15:28.115
on an interview given
to one of our ASAs

15:28.160 --> 15:30.651
by an investigator here,
a Blake Calamar.

15:30.690 --> 15:32.555
Oh, yes.
Blake no longer works here.

15:32.590 --> 15:34.126
Yeah, I-I-I know.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.219
But, um, you see,
some of the pages

15:36.260 --> 15:37.568
from his interview
are... are gone,

15:37.600 --> 15:40.637
and, uh, I'm-I'm trying to
hunt down what he said.

15:40.670 --> 15:42.535
Don't you think you
should be talking to Blake?

15:42.570 --> 15:43.559
(chuckling):
If you'll excuse me...

15:43.610 --> 15:45.100
Unfortunately,
I can't.

15:45.140 --> 15:47.529
I-I hit a dead end, and
I don't like dead ends,

15:47.580 --> 15:49.502
and I was hoping that
you could help me

15:49.540 --> 15:51.098
understand why Blake
was talking about you.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.341
Me?
Yeah.

15:54.380 --> 15:57.508
You see, I found a small portion
of the preliminary notes,

15:57.550 --> 16:00.189
and the subject line
for the interview

16:00.220 --> 16:02.154
is listed as "Alicia Florrick."

16:02.190 --> 16:04.055
So I was wondering
if you knew

16:04.090 --> 16:05.421
what he might
be discussing.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.721
No, I don't.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.091
You're sure?

16:10.130 --> 16:12.121
I have to go.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.665
So we're not going
to handle this like gentlemen?

16:15.700 --> 16:17.634
Actually, I think this is
how gentlemen handle it.

16:17.670 --> 16:18.807
We just filed a suit

16:18.840 --> 16:21.775
contesting the Venezuelan
nationalizing of Latin Star

16:21.810 --> 16:23.778
until the World Bank's ICSID

16:23.810 --> 16:25.277
assesses a value
for the company.

16:25.310 --> 16:27.039
HUGO CHAVEZ: No, no, no.
Strike three, birdie.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.616
You struck out.
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

16:28.650 --> 16:30.584
Did you have something to add?

16:30.620 --> 16:32.542
(Chavez speaking Spanish)

16:35.720 --> 16:37.483
My Spanish may be
a little rusty,

16:37.530 --> 16:39.486
but I think_ President Chavez
disagrees.

16:39.530 --> 16:41.623
CHAVEZ: Tell them, DA.
You're the DA. You tell them.

16:41.660 --> 16:43.059
No, no.
I told you, now.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.761
I'm not an actual DA.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.633
I, uh, did impersonate one
on TV.

16:47.670 --> 16:48.694
Phone Sean Penn. Phone him.

16:48.740 --> 16:50.162
(Chavez speaking Spanish)

16:50.210 --> 16:51.404
The president
would like

16:51.440 --> 16:53.704
for you to understand that, uh,

16:53.740 --> 16:55.105
he is now the...

16:55.140 --> 16:57.472
sole owner
of Latin Star,

16:57.510 --> 16:59.774
and has
rechristened it...

16:59.810 --> 17:03.041
the, uh, Love Drilling
and Oil Company.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.512
(Chavez continues
speaking Spanish)

17:04.550 --> 17:06.745
Uh, "The Americans
again want my oil.

17:06.790 --> 17:09.088
They thirst for it.
All Americans."

17:11.690 --> 17:14.090
"Except Courtney Love.
Nothen"

17:14.130 --> 17:15.654
(Chavez continues
speaking Spanish)

17:15.700 --> 17:16.758
NATALIE:
Uh...

17:16.800 --> 17:20.065
"Even now, she is not
appreciated in her country.

17:20.100 --> 17:23.604
Where is her Academy Award?
Where?"

17:23.640 --> 17:26.108
THOMAS (clears throat):
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

17:27.740 --> 17:29.674
President Chavez has thanked you
for your service,

17:29.710 --> 17:33.544
and he's just asking that you
step back, uh, from the case.

17:33.580 --> 17:36.777
Yes, the only problem is,
the law of his own country

17:36.820 --> 17:38.742
requires a three-month period
to assess

17:38.790 --> 17:41.384
the value
of our client's company.

17:41.420 --> 17:44.355
(Chavez speaking Spanish)

17:44.390 --> 17:45.755
He's changing the law.

17:45.790 --> 17:47.223
What?

17:47.260 --> 17:48.750
NATALIE: The Enabling
Law of 2008.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.768
The Venezuelan
National Assembly voted

17:50.800 --> 17:53.564
to give the president
the power to change law

17:53.600 --> 17:55.568
if it protected the
interests of Venezuela.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.158
Oh, my God.
(sighs)

17:57.210 --> 17:59.861
It's like being
in a Woody Allen movie.

17:59.910 --> 18:01.832
Have it ready
by 1:00 for court.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.507
You, too.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.676
Good job.

18:04.710 --> 18:05.802
Thank you.

18:05.850 --> 18:08.068
Oh, Alicia,
do you have a moment?

18:11.720 --> 18:15.850
So who am I negotiating with
here-- you or Venezuela?

18:15.890 --> 18:17.858
We're going to court
right now to find out.

18:17.890 --> 18:20.495
Unfortunately, you lost
your window, Mr. Gardner.

18:20.530 --> 18:23.522
PlatacoStillman is a
very busy company, so...

18:23.570 --> 18:27.267
why don't we pencil in a time
for depositions in, uh, 2012?

18:27.300 --> 18:29.359
You mean after you've
bankrupted my client?

18:29.400 --> 18:30.731
No, we're going
to continue

18:30.770 --> 18:32.658
these depositions
this afternoon.

18:32.710 --> 18:35.304
You're not going
to be ready this afternoon.

18:35.340 --> 18:38.275
We're going to be ready
this afternoon.

18:38.310 --> 18:41.609
You know, we have other ways
to attack this.

18:41.650 --> 18:45.245
Contractual law is just
so bloodless, don't you think?

18:45.290 --> 18:47.417
See you this afternoon.

18:49.590 --> 18:50.887
DIANE:
Take the afternoon off.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.227
Excuse me?

18:52.260 --> 18:53.898
Go ahead.
Take the afternoon off.

18:53.930 --> 18:55.227
You deserve it.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.921
I... uh, thank you,

18:56.960 --> 18:59.167
but this is my case--
I'm committed.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.839
I know, and you can continue
with it tomorrow.

19:01.870 --> 19:03.565
We'll be fine in court.

19:03.610 --> 19:04.929
This isn't
a punishment.

19:04.970 --> 19:07.200
We just... we have
too many voices right now,

19:07.240 --> 19:08.673
so take a break for a few hours.

19:08.710 --> 19:10.849
This afternoon?
Yes.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.370
Who talked to you?

19:14.520 --> 19:15.817
Who talked to me?

19:15.850 --> 19:17.613
Yes.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.618
Did Eli call?

19:21.860 --> 19:25.352
Alicia, take the afternoon off.

19:25.390 --> 19:28.154
Come back tomorrow
for the depositions.

19:39.710 --> 19:41.200
ELI :_ _
Hey, AIICIa.

19:41.240 --> 19:42.537
How are you?
You sound a little...

19:42.580 --> 19:43.649
This is my life, Eli.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.944
You don't meddle with my life.

19:46.910 --> 19:48.468
Okay, Alicia. What's wrong?

19:48.520 --> 19:49.919
I've been working on this case

19:49.950 --> 19:51.918
for over a year now,
and you do this?

19:51.950 --> 19:53.884
Well, you can forget it.
I'm not doing the interview.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.650
And I don't care if Peter blames
me for the rest of his life.

19:56.690 --> 19:57.952
And as I understand it,
you're asking

19:57.990 --> 19:59.287
for an emergency injunction.

19:59.330 --> 20:00.627
DIANE:
Yes, Your Honor.

20:00.660 --> 20:01.888
We were in the midst

20:01.930 --> 20:04.296
of a settlement negotiation
with PlatacoStillman,

20:04.330 --> 20:05.922
and in our opinion,

20:05.970 --> 20:08.962
Venezuela has no standing
in this suit.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.900
No, we would agree
that the president of Venezuela

20:10.940 --> 20:13.602
has the power
to change laws in his country,

20:13.640 --> 20:16.370
but in our opinion,
those powers should not

20:16.410 --> 20:17.877
impact a lawsuit
in this country.

20:17.910 --> 20:19.400
The president
hasn't changed the laws

20:19.450 --> 20:20.917
of the United States,
Your Honor.

20:20.950 --> 20:22.941
He's changed the
laws of Venezuela,

20:22.980 --> 20:25.483
and they just happen
to impact a lawsuit here.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.818
Was that in your opinion?

20:27.860 --> 20:29.009
Excuse me?

20:29.060 --> 20:29.958
Your opinion.

20:29.990 --> 20:32.026
You were expressing
your opinion, right?

20:32.060 --> 20:33.652
I don't know, uh,
what you're getting at.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.019
Your Honor?

20:35.060 --> 20:38.826
It is just such an honor
to have you in my court, sir.

20:38.870 --> 20:40.565
Oh, it's my honor, Your Honor.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.431
LESSNER: You don't know
how many young people

20:42.470 --> 20:43.767
you encourage
with your show.

20:43.810 --> 20:44.868
Oh, thank you, but, uh,

20:44.910 --> 20:47.606
it would probably be a mistake
to call it my show.

20:47.640 --> 20:48.834
And so humble.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.371
I must say, you...
you look taller in person.

20:51.410 --> 20:52.809
(laughing)

20:52.850 --> 20:54.715
Well, now, you're
embarrassing me, ma'am.

20:54.750 --> 20:55.876
Just one woman's opinion.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.945
(wry laugh)
Your Honor, just quickly--

20:57.990 --> 20:59.981
this case is not about
the opposmg counsel.

21:00.020 --> 21:01.817
It's about his client,
President Hugo Chavez.

21:01.860 --> 21:03.851
THOMAS:
I would disagree.

21:03.890 --> 21:06.051
It's about the rule of law
In Venezuela.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.819
You mean the new
rule of law.

21:07.860 --> 21:10.055
This law was changed a
half hour ago, Your Honor--

21:10.100 --> 21:12.967
in my opinion-- and as such,
it is a ex post facto law.

21:13.000 --> 21:13.830
LESSN ER:
Unfortunately, Mr. Gardner,

21:13.870 --> 21:16.395
Ms. Lockhart,
I am a judge in Chicago.

21:16.440 --> 21:18.931
I have no jurisdiction
over Venezuelan law.

21:18.970 --> 21:20.801
I do understand your argument

21:20.840 --> 21:22.705
for emergency relief,
so I will freeze

21:22.740 --> 21:24.401
Latin Star's assets until...

21:24.450 --> 21:26.509
Your Honor, it has
taken us a year

21:26.550 --> 21:28.677
to get PlatacoStillman to
the negotiations table.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.540
Our-our client has
had a heart attack

21:30.590 --> 21:32.615
clue to the drawn-out
nature of this fight.

21:32.650 --> 21:35.084
A freeze would not be in
the interests of Latin Star

21:35.120 --> 21:36.985
or the Venezuelan people,
Your Honor.

21:37.020 --> 21:39.022
Then I would suggest
that you align your interests

21:39.060 --> 21:40.084
against PlatacoStillman.

21:40.130 --> 21:43.019
You both have reason to
want a fair settlement.

21:43.060 --> 21:46.029
In my opinion, the best result
would be for you,

21:46.070 --> 21:48.732
Mr. Gardner, Ms. Lockhart,
to represent President Chavez

21:48.770 --> 21:50.408
in this lawsuit, too.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.101
And thank you, sir,

21:52.140 --> 21:55.701
for doing all you've done to
inspire the youth of America.

21:56.540 --> 21:58.940
Great.

21:58.980 --> 21:59.969
We have a dictator
for a client.

22:04.120 --> 22:05.087
Well, here we are.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.485
(Chavez laughing)

22:06.520 --> 22:08.556
I'm glad your client
finds this funny.

22:08.590 --> 22:10.524
(Chavez speaking Spanish)
What is he saying?

22:10.560 --> 22:11.584
He likes your dress.

22:11.630 --> 22:12.779
Oh, how nice.

22:12.830 --> 22:14.991
You know, this doesn't
have to be bad.

22:15.030 --> 22:17.828
There are certain advantages
to being on the same side.
Such as?

22:17.870 --> 22:20.532
Well, it appears everyone
has kissed and made up.

22:20.570 --> 22:21.969
Can we continue?

22:22.000 --> 22:25.128
Yes. And we'd like to add
a name to the witness list.

22:25.170 --> 22:28.105
A Juan Perez.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.903
And who might
this be?

22:29.940 --> 22:32.477
Well, he's the director
of the Venezuelan Interior.

22:32.510 --> 22:36.048
Ah, a present from
President Chavez. How nice.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.479
(Chavez laughing)

22:37.520 --> 22:39.738
And what might
Mr. Perez swear to?

22:39.790 --> 22:43.419
He'll swear that your client,
the CEO of PlatacoStillman,

22:43.460 --> 22:45.587
admitted cheating Latin Star
out of its fee.

22:45.630 --> 22:46.585
Really?

22:46.630 --> 22:48.951
My goodness,
what a revelation.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.468
Mr. Gardner, I guess
dictatorship has its privileges.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.764
You can always make a deal.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.997
Well, we have four names
that we would like to
add to the witness list.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.462
Remember when I told you we had
other ways to attack this?

22:58.510 --> 23:00.159
How could I forget?

23:00.210 --> 23:02.405
Well, PlatacoStillman doesn't
owe Latin Star a cent--

23:02.440 --> 23:03.748
I'm sorry, a red cent.

23:03.780 --> 23:05.099
Because our boiler plate

23:05.150 --> 23:07.573
charges prevent us from
compensating companies

23:07.620 --> 23:10.487
that commit human
rights Violations.
Oh, come on.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.886
These four men will testify
to life-threatening conditions

23:12.920 --> 23:14.410
that they personally witnessed

23:14.460 --> 23:17.588
on the Latin Star rigs
in Venezuela.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.586
My father says his rigs have
a perfect safety record.

23:19.630 --> 23:22.098
Not a single
violation or infraction.

23:22.130 --> 23:24.667
I need you to look into
these four witnesses.

23:24.700 --> 23:26.565
Any direction?

23:26.600 --> 23:28.033
We reached a stalemate
with PlatacoStillman.

23:28.070 --> 23:30.436
They're lying about
human rights violations.

23:30.470 --> 23:31.505
Find out why.

23:31.540 --> 23:32.939
Hey, why weren't you in there?

23:32.970 --> 23:35.131
I thought you were on
PlatacoStillman.

23:35.180 --> 23:36.807
I'm on leave.

23:36.840 --> 23:37.943
Leave?

23:37.980 --> 23:39.504
Just for the afternoon.

23:39.550 --> 23:40.676
Do you know an Andrew Wiley

23:40.720 --> 23:42.017
at the State's
Attorney's Office?

23:42.050 --> 23:45.019
The investigator.
Yeah, he works with Cary.

23:45.050 --> 23:47.689
He was asking about
a last interview Blake did;

23:47.720 --> 23:49.585
a last interview where
he talked about me.

23:49.620 --> 23:52.623
Did Cary mention this?

23:52.660 --> 23:53.888
No.

23:53.930 --> 23:55.693
Probably the state's
attorney's last gasp.

23:55.730 --> 23:59.723
Yes, an attempt
to intimidate me.

23:59.770 --> 24:02.568
Alicia.
Yeah?

24:02.600 --> 24:04.704
I need to...
(elevator bell dings)

24:04.740 --> 24:06.162
Can we talk sometime?

24:06.210 --> 24:07.871
Whenever you want.

24:07.910 --> 24:09.673
I'm on leave.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.875
Alicia, there you are.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.478
Is everything okay?

24:18.520 --> 24:19.441
Oh, yeah.

24:19.490 --> 24:20.912
I just-- I'm on something
else this afternoon.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.781
How's your dad?
Good.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.185
I had to tell him about
Hugo Chavez's involvement.

24:26.230 --> 24:27.652
He was confused.

24:27.700 --> 24:28.849
Yeah, I am, too.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.095
Would you excuse me
a moment?
Sure.

24:34.970 --> 24:37.029
Thank you, Diane.

24:37.070 --> 24:38.537
Ah, Mrs. Florrick.

24:38.570 --> 24:39.537
I don't think
we've ever met.

24:39.570 --> 24:41.174
Frank Landau.
Hello.

24:41.210 --> 24:43.178
We're all rooting for
your husband, ma'am.

24:43.210 --> 24:45.508
_ Take care.
Nice to meet you.

24:48.250 --> 24:50.548
Diane, sorry, just quickly...

24:50.590 --> 24:53.081
Yes, I thought you were
taking the afternoon off.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.553
Iam. Ijust...

24:54.590 --> 24:56.512
Was that the Chairman of
the Democratic Committee?

24:56.560 --> 24:58.255
Uh, yes.

24:58.290 --> 25:00.053
Frank.
An old friend.

25:00.090 --> 25:01.728
He was worried_we were
representing

25:01.760 --> 25:04.729
Hugo Chavez
these days.

25:04.770 --> 25:08.490
He was the one who asked you
to give me the afternoon off?

25:09.900 --> 25:11.538
I wish you wouldn't worry
about it, Alicia.

25:11.570 --> 25:12.832
It's not a punishment.

25:12.870 --> 25:15.577
I know, but Frank Landau
asked you, didn't he?

25:18.050 --> 25:19.847
Thank you.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.542
HARDING:
This is Mr. Carlos Santos,

25:24.590 --> 25:27.309
a worker on the
Latin Star oil rig,

25:27.350 --> 25:29.580
and recent migr
to America.

25:29.620 --> 25:31.087
Mr. Santos,
nice to meet you?

25:31.130 --> 25:33.621
(Chavez speaking Spanish)

25:33.660 --> 25:35.059
It's a worker,
Mr. President.

25:35.100 --> 25:37.250
A man named
Carlos Santos.

25:37.300 --> 25:38.824
WILL: _
So you say you Witnessed

25:38.870 --> 25:40.189
human rights abuses

25:40.230 --> 25:43.563
on the oil rigs in
Venezuela, Mr. Santos?

25:43.610 --> 25:45.259
(Chavez speaking Spanish)
Mr. Santos?

25:47.740 --> 25:50.948
I have been awarded the
Al-Gaddafi International Prize

25:50.980 --> 25:53.972
for Human Rights
by Colonel Gaddafi.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.580
I would never stand
for human rights

25:56.620 --> 25:58.884
violations in
my country. Never.

25:58.920 --> 25:59.887
(Chavez continues in Spanish)

25:59.920 --> 26:03.629
So tell this Santos
he is lying.

26:03.660 --> 26:05.287
Do you refute that,
Mr. Santos?

26:10.130 --> 26:12.325
Do you have family still
in Venezuela, Mr. Santos?

26:12.370 --> 26:14.065
Si.

26:14.100 --> 26:16.694
(speaking Spanish)

26:16.740 --> 26:18.708
A wife and two kids.

26:18.740 --> 26:20.162
THOMAS:
So you would like to change
your testimony too,

26:20.210 --> 26:22.735
Mr. Pulito?

26:25.380 --> 26:28.713
I guess you have family
in Venezuela, too?

26:33.690 --> 26:34.759
No, no, wait, Kalinda.

26:34.790 --> 26:36.849
You don't need to look into
three of the workers.

26:36.890 --> 26:38.027
They recanted.

26:38.060 --> 26:39.925
Just one_of_ them
is testifying.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.951
He doesn't have family
in Venezuela.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.297
Which one?

26:43.330 --> 26:45.764
Okay, got it.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.165
Hey.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.065
I need help with just
one of the names.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.636
Esteban Gonzales.

26:54.680 --> 26:57.672
Walk with me.
Share your troubles.

26:57.710 --> 27:00.042
(sighs)

27:00.080 --> 27:04.187
Cary, what's going on with
your investigator Wiley?

27:04.220 --> 27:07.383
My investigator?
I don't know. Why?

27:07.420 --> 27:09.888
He approached Alicia.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.320
He doesn't know.

27:12.360 --> 27:15.329
I know, but he
approached Alicia.

27:15.360 --> 27:16.998
I can't stop him.

27:17.030 --> 27:20.022
The more I try to stop him,
the harder he digs.

27:20.070 --> 27:22.664
I have to talk to her.

27:22.700 --> 27:24.429
(whistles)

27:24.470 --> 27:26.233
Yeah, that's a hard one.

27:26.270 --> 27:27.806
By the way, I slept
with your husband.

27:27.840 --> 27:31.879
Oh, sorry,
is that too blunt?

27:31.910 --> 27:33.775
It was before we met.

27:33.820 --> 27:36.846
Okay, well, then maybe
she'll understand.

27:36.880 --> 27:39.678
You know what?
It's my turn.

27:39.720 --> 27:43.827
Before you talk to Alicia
about your... issue,

27:43.860 --> 27:45.953
ask her to smooth things
over for me with Peter.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.259
What? You're always
asking me for favors.

27:50.300 --> 27:51.824
This is mine.

27:51.870 --> 27:53.861
If Peter is elected,
I don't want to be
summarily fired

27:53.900 --> 27:55.765
because there's
bad blood between us.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.132
So you're going to stay at
the State's Attorney's Office?

27:58.170 --> 28:00.832
I like it there.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.472
But don't tell her
you slept with Peter

28:02.510 --> 28:04.205
before you put in
a good word for me, okay?

28:09.020 --> 28:11.011
Uh, I gotta go.

28:13.390 --> 28:15.255
Mrs. Florrick, hello.

28:15.290 --> 28:17.850
Peter isn't here.

28:17.890 --> 28:20.381
I'm sorry.
I thought it was you.

28:20.430 --> 28:22.421
What was me?

28:22.460 --> 28:23.791
I was excused

28:23.830 --> 28:26.367
from work for the
afternoon by Diane,

28:26.400 --> 28:27.833
and I thought
you were the one

28:27.870 --> 28:29.098
who arranged it.

28:29.140 --> 28:30.732
No, never.
I know.

28:30.770 --> 28:31.839
It was Frank Landau.

28:33.810 --> 28:35.038
Sorry.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.775
He's a little... worried.

28:36.810 --> 28:37.845
I know.

28:38.810 --> 28:40.346
I'll do it.

28:40.380 --> 28:41.745
It?

28:41.780 --> 28:42.940
The interview.

28:42.980 --> 28:46.245
If it's not too late.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.281
Sorry.

28:48.320 --> 28:50.151
It's my decision.

28:53.030 --> 28:54.918
Then thank you.

29:00.530 --> 29:01.929
The witness,
Esteban Gonzales,

29:01.970 --> 29:05.007
was indeed injured in
a oil rig accident.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.860
There are hospital records
in both Venezuela and Chicago.

29:06.910 --> 29:07.899
It's untrue.
My dad said...

29:07.940 --> 29:10.329
It's not from your
dad's oil rig.

29:10.380 --> 29:12.348
Now the hospital
records show

29:12.380 --> 29:16.111
that he had salt water in his
lungs when he was admitted.

29:16.150 --> 29:19.347
Which is odd-- because all the
Latin Star rigs are land-based.

29:21.860 --> 29:24.158
Yep. And you know who has
offshore rigs?

29:24.190 --> 29:25.885
PlatacoStillman.

29:25.930 --> 29:26.851
THOMAS: Well, looks
like we have something

29:26.890 --> 29:29.097
to discuss with our adversaries.

29:29.130 --> 29:32.463
It's a performance, a show,
and you're the wife.

29:32.500 --> 29:33.569
I know, I know.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.431
But people don't
listen, they watch.

29:35.470 --> 29:38.530
And they want to see
you at ease, calm, loving.

29:38.570 --> 29:40.162
So...

29:40.210 --> 29:43.077
Do you forgive Peter?

29:43.110 --> 29:46.898
I think Peter is my husband;
he's the father of my children;

29:46.950 --> 29:48.975
and I watch him every day,

29:49.020 --> 29:50.988
trying to make amends
for his past mistakes.

29:51.020 --> 29:52.282
So that's a no?

29:52.320 --> 29:53.309
No, it's a yes.

29:53.350 --> 29:54.282
Good.

29:54.320 --> 29:55.878
Thank you.

29:57.560 --> 29:58.822
Is it true?

29:58.860 --> 30:01.522
Did it sound true?

30:04.070 --> 30:06.823
Do you know Peter slept
with Amber Madison

30:06.870 --> 30:09.134
on 18 separate occasions?

30:11.070 --> 30:13.903
She's gunning for you on that.

30:13.940 --> 30:15.100
I do know that.

30:15.140 --> 30:17.199
Does that bother you?
Does it bother me?
It horrifies me.

30:17.240 --> 30:19.606
Okay, okay, a little less.

30:19.650 --> 30:22.073
But Peter
and I discussed it.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.917
_ It was a difficult
time in our marriage.

30:23.950 --> 30:27.909
Peter was at work so much,
and I was at home.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.450
A marriage needs
constant attention,

30:29.490 --> 30:31.583
and we_allowed
our attention to flag.

30:31.630 --> 30:32.824
Good.

30:32.860 --> 30:35.522
So why will it be different
this time if Peter is elected?

30:35.560 --> 30:39.223
Because Peter has seen
the in5ide of a prison cell.

30:39.270 --> 30:42.239
He's found
an enduring faith.

30:42.270 --> 30:44.465
And he's seen the hurt
he's done to our children.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.000
Good. Tell me about
your children.

30:46.040 --> 30:47.439
How have they handled it?

30:51.110 --> 30:53.647
(voice breaking):
They're...

30:53.680 --> 30:55.318
they're the best
people I know.

30:57.450 --> 30:59.315
I love them more...

31:04.060 --> 31:05.880
I would do anything
to see them not hurt.

31:05.930 --> 31:08.125
They love their father,

31:08.160 --> 31:10.628
and they have stood
by him throughout.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.059
Good.

31:12.100 --> 31:14.295
Emotional, but not too...

31:15.600 --> 31:17.909
So, tell me about
your work.

31:17.940 --> 31:20.534
Do you worry your work takes
you away from your children?

31:20.570 --> 31:21.434
I do.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.209
But I needed to work
to support my family.

31:23.240 --> 31:24.502
So will you stop working
when he's elected?

31:24.550 --> 31:25.676
No.

31:25.710 --> 31:28.076
I care about my work,

31:28.120 --> 31:30.008
I care about my clients,

31:30.050 --> 31:31.517
and I think that my children
support what I do.

31:31.550 --> 31:33.188
You think?
Yes.

31:33.220 --> 31:34.687
You have to be
more definitive.

31:34.720 --> 31:38.429
Any anecdotes with the
kids that you can relate?

31:38.460 --> 31:40.997
No, that is
definitive enough.

31:41.030 --> 31:42.918
Okay.

31:42.960 --> 31:43.961
Good.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.968
Let her come off
as the bully.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.059
The viewers want her to
ask the tough questions,

31:48.100 --> 31:49.658
then they feel guilty
and start blaming her,

31:49.700 --> 31:52.999
so just stay... cool.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.928
And real.
MAN:
We're ready for you now.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.072
We'll be right there.

31:56.110 --> 31:57.941
(sighs)

31:57.980 --> 31:59.402
Thank you, Alicia.

31:59.450 --> 32:02.544
I... Ijust wish this
were all so much easier.

32:02.580 --> 32:05.413
Well, if it were easier,
everybody would be doing it.

32:05.450 --> 32:07.589
(phone ringing)

32:07.620 --> 32:09.053
Alicia Florrick.

32:09.090 --> 32:10.057
Mrs. Florrick, Andrew Wiley.

32:10.090 --> 32:12.024
About my investigation--
do you have a moment?

32:12.060 --> 32:13.994
No, Mr. Wiley, I do not.

32:14.030 --> 32:16.726
And if you contact me one more
time without some real evidence,

32:16.760 --> 32:18.660
I will sue your office
for harassment,

32:18.700 --> 32:20.588
do you understand me?

32:26.540 --> 32:28.076
This means nothing.

32:28.110 --> 32:30.032
It means everything.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.707
It means
Luis Rios never had

32:31.750 --> 32:33.206
a human rights
problem on his rigs,

32:33.250 --> 32:36.515
but you did, Mr. Francis.

32:36.550 --> 32:37.744
I think that's
a stretch.

32:37.780 --> 32:39.281
WILL: Let's see how
stretchy it is

32:39.320 --> 32:40.639
to the press and
your shareholders.

32:40.690 --> 32:42.009
(Chavez laughing)

32:42.060 --> 32:43.982
First I beat George W. Bush--

32:44.030 --> 32:47.454
now I beat you, Mr. Danger!

32:47.490 --> 32:48.696
(clears throat)

32:48.730 --> 32:50.095
$50 million.

32:50.130 --> 32:51.461
With a gag order.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.058
But we_ have
to close right now.

32:53.100 --> 32:54.761
No.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.132
Uh, I think we need a minute.

32:57.170 --> 32:58.307
THOMAS:
No we don't.

32:58.340 --> 32:59.568
You'll have to do better.

32:59.610 --> 33:02.431
This is not the time
to play good cop, bad cop.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.629
I'm not.

33:03.680 --> 33:06.046
$50 million
is not acceptable.

33:06.080 --> 33:07.707
Oh, come on, President!

33:07.750 --> 33:09.308
This is ridiculous.

33:09.350 --> 33:12.046
(Chavez speaking Spanish)

33:12.090 --> 33:14.752
(Francis and Chavez
arguing in Spanish)

33:14.790 --> 33:16.280
He's saying,
"I know what you want,

33:16.320 --> 33:17.617
and you're never gonna get it."

33:17.660 --> 33:18.627
Wait, who?

33:18.660 --> 33:20.127
The CEO is telling Chavez

33:20.160 --> 33:21.127
that he's never
gonna get it.

33:21.160 --> 33:22.491
And the president is saying,

33:22.530 --> 33:24.395
"It was mine anyway.
You stole it."

33:24.430 --> 33:26.227
What?
What did they steal?

33:26.270 --> 33:29.694
A geophysical surveying map
of the untapped oil reserves

33:29.740 --> 33:30.968
in the Orinoco belt.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.504
President Chavez wants this map
to know where to drill for oil.

33:34.540 --> 33:37.077
And PlatacoStillman
commi55ioned the survey

33:37.110 --> 33:39.044
and considers it
proprietary work product.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.809
And what does this have to do
with your lawsuit?

33:40.850 --> 33:43.148
Nothing, Your Honor,
in our opinion.

33:43.180 --> 33:45.410
That's why we ask you
to sever the two cases.

33:45.450 --> 33:47.418
President Chavez has a
conflict of interest here.

33:47.450 --> 33:51.056
What he's asking for won't
benefit my client in the least.

33:51.090 --> 33:52.352
THOMAS:
There is no conflict

33:52.390 --> 33:53.618
of interest, Your Honor.

33:53.660 --> 33:55.457
The president
is trying to negotiate

33:55.500 --> 33:57.127
a greater settlement,
that's all.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.821
We all benefit from
a greater settlement.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.826
Don't we, Your Honor?

34:00.870 --> 34:02.633
(laughs)

34:02.840 --> 34:03.829
Y-Your Honor?

34:03.870 --> 34:05.303
Was that in your opinion?

34:08.280 --> 34:11.249
Well, yes, in my opinion.

34:11.280 --> 34:12.542
THOMAS: So we're back
to square one?

34:12.580 --> 34:14.218
Okay, here's the deal.

34:14.250 --> 34:16.639
You want the surveys,
we want the money.

34:16.680 --> 34:19.285
DIANE: We'll drop out of the
case, and you settle with

34:19.320 --> 34:21.311
PlatacoStillman for
the survey maps.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.349
Okay.

34:22.390 --> 34:23.414
And what do you get?

34:23.460 --> 34:26.725
Transfer of $86 million
to this Latin Star account

34:26.760 --> 34:28.455
by end of business day today.

34:28.500 --> 34:29.626
(chuckles)

34:29.660 --> 34:31.298
You were willing to take
$50 million

34:31.330 --> 34:32.661
from PlatacoStillman.

34:32.700 --> 34:35.498
Just consider that the standard
surcharge for dictators.

34:38.870 --> 34:41.065
Let me take it to the president.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.472
You know,
he's really a nice person,

34:44.510 --> 34:45.374
once you get to know him.

34:45.410 --> 34:47.605
Sings like an angel.

34:47.650 --> 34:50.539
Good job, Natalie.

34:50.580 --> 34:52.389
WILL: You can manage
my money anytime.

34:52.420 --> 34:53.387
(Diane laughs)

34:53.420 --> 34:54.717
And thank you.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.182
For everything, really.

34:56.220 --> 34:58.154
This has been cool.

34:59.190 --> 35:01.351
Dad, really,
you can stop worrying.

35:01.400 --> 35:04.665
I'm not just
saying that.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.191
I'm not saying that to
make you feel better.

35:07.230 --> 35:10.597
I think he's a good man.

35:10.640 --> 35:14.508
I think he would be the first
to admit he has flaws,

35:14.540 --> 35:16.679
but I wouldn't be here
if I thought otherwise.

35:16.710 --> 35:19.645
ERICA HILL: So you think there's
no connection then between the--

35:19.680 --> 35:22.376
a person's public persona
and their private one?

35:22.420 --> 35:24.388
No, I definitely
think there is.

35:24.420 --> 35:27.344
I just think it's easy
for people to judge,

35:27.390 --> 35:29.358
and I think it's harder
for them to forgive.

35:29.390 --> 35:30.687
ERICA:
So you have forgiven him?

35:30.720 --> 35:31.527
ALICIA:
I have.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.881
What is in the past
is in the past.

35:33.930 --> 35:35.192
ERICA:
And your children--

35:35.230 --> 35:36.322
have they forgiven him?

35:36.360 --> 35:39.158
My children love their father.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.827
They would do anything for him.

35:40.870 --> 35:43.395
And I think the
hardest thing for Peter

35:43.440 --> 35:45.635
has been seeing
how much he's hurt them.

35:45.670 --> 35:48.400
Believe me, he will do anything
not to hurt them again.

35:48.440 --> 35:49.839
ERICA:
And what about you, Alicia?

35:49.880 --> 35:51.245
Do you have any designs

35:51.280 --> 35:52.804
on a political career?

35:52.850 --> 35:55.512
(laughs)

35:55.550 --> 35:57.518
Is it really
such a strange question?

35:57.550 --> 35:58.642
You're smart, you're eloquent,

35:58.690 --> 36:00.646
well-known, well-liked--

36:00.690 --> 36:02.453
my guess is, better liked
than your husband.

36:02.490 --> 36:03.457
ALICIA:
I doubt that.

36:03.490 --> 36:04.354
I'm not built for it.

36:04.390 --> 36:06.426
I don't like getting
up in front of people.

36:06.460 --> 36:07.449
You could've
fooled me.

36:07.490 --> 36:09.720
(chuckles)
Well, thank you.

36:09.760 --> 36:13.491
But I'm enjoying my job
too much, and being a mother.

36:13.530 --> 36:15.259
That's what I'm good at.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.495
ERICA:
And don't you think we need
more women in politics?

36:17.540 --> 36:20.259
Wouldn't women make
a bigger difference in politics?

36:20.310 --> 36:21.629
ALICIA:
I think men and women would...

36:21.680 --> 36:22.738
What do you think?

36:22.780 --> 36:24.600
...make just about the same
difference in politics.

36:24.650 --> 36:27.244
People do good and bad things
based on who they are...

36:27.280 --> 36:29.874
I think she's fantastic.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.445
I think she just
won him the election.

36:32.490 --> 36:34.651
Probably.

36:34.690 --> 36:38.820
You should tell her
how fantastic she is.

36:38.860 --> 36:40.452
She knows.

36:40.490 --> 36:42.697
You should tell her.

36:42.730 --> 36:44.459
People like to be told.

36:47.700 --> 36:49.395
You're in a weird mood.

36:50.900 --> 36:52.902
Iam.

36:59.010 --> 37:00.739
ANCHORMAN: After an election
year filled With scandals,

37:00.780 --> 37:02.748
the race for Cook County
State's Attorney is one we plan

37:02.780 --> 37:04.645
to follow, as precincts
continue to report results.

37:04.690 --> 37:07.579
While Peter Florrick has kept
a slight but consistent lead...

37:07.620 --> 37:09.611
(cheering, applause)

37:16.400 --> 37:18.698
MAN: Hey, it's the
candidate's wife, everybody!

37:18.730 --> 37:20.721
(cheering)

37:23.670 --> 37:24.864
Mom, they love you.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.263
It's election night.

37:26.310 --> 37:27.436
Wait till tomorrow.

37:27.470 --> 37:29.404
Nice one.
Oh. Thank you.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.340
Alicia Florrick had been
out of the public eye

37:31.380 --> 37:32.449
for much of this campaign--

37:32.480 --> 37:33.902
so local pundits believed this
actually hurt Peter,

37:33.950 --> 37:35.315
not to have his wife--

37:35.350 --> 37:38.478
MAN:
I'm sorry to interrupt, Kate,
but we have one more township

37:38.520 --> 37:39.680
reporting in.

37:39.720 --> 37:42.314
Orland Township goes
to Peter Florrick.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.657
(cheering, applause)

37:45.690 --> 37:48.523
You need to get him to start
thinking about the next.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.754
Let him win this one first.

37:49.800 --> 37:50.994
Come on, Eli.

37:51.030 --> 37:52.793
You rest tonight,
we start tomorrow.

37:52.830 --> 37:56.038
On?

37:56.070 --> 37:58.300
The US. Senate.

37:58.340 --> 38:00.467
Don't act surprised.

38:00.510 --> 38:02.307
It was the goal
all along.

38:02.340 --> 38:04.843
And the Democratic Committee
will stand behind him?

38:04.880 --> 38:07.303
That's a good boy
you got there, Eli.

38:07.350 --> 38:08.510
People like him.

38:08.550 --> 38:09.517
They like his story.

38:09.550 --> 38:10.847
They especially
like his wife.

38:10.880 --> 38:11.881
The comeback
is one thing,

38:11.920 --> 38:13.410
but one year after
being convicted,

38:13.450 --> 38:15.486
to get this-- whew!

38:15.520 --> 38:17.784
And that's a testament
to you, by the way.

38:17.820 --> 38:19.856
So you'll support him
officially?

38:19.890 --> 38:23.053
Let him get his
feet wet first.

38:23.100 --> 38:26.399
You start lining up donors,
and sure, we'll be there.

38:27.930 --> 38:29.397
LANDAU:
Alicia!

38:29.440 --> 38:31.567
There you are.

38:31.610 --> 38:32.565
What an interview.

38:32.610 --> 38:34.407
I've never seen Erica

38:34.440 --> 38:35.873
eat out of someone's
hand like that before.

38:35.910 --> 38:37.878
(laughs)
Mr. Landau.
Where's Peter?

38:37.910 --> 38:40.549
Oh, like the bride before
the wedding, indisposed.

38:40.580 --> 38:42.013
Good job, Alicia.

38:42.050 --> 38:43.915
Thank you.

38:45.750 --> 38:47.581
(piano playing "Danny Boy")

38:47.620 --> 38:51.886
JACKIE:
* And flowers are in

38:51.930 --> 38:53.659
* The meadow

38:53.690 --> 38:54.998
* 'Tis you,
'tis you... *

38:55.030 --> 38:56.850
Grandma's drunk.

38:56.900 --> 38:58.367
I think that's just her.

38:58.400 --> 39:01.563
* I must bide.

39:03.170 --> 39:06.401
Alicia, isn't
it wonderful?

39:06.440 --> 39:07.998
(chuckles):
The kids.

39:08.040 --> 39:10.600
You're so special.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.403
Grace, look at you.

39:12.450 --> 39:14.941
Growing up.

39:16.850 --> 39:18.818
You made me proud.

39:18.850 --> 39:20.886
Your interview
made me cry.

39:20.920 --> 39:22.057
(chuckles)

39:22.090 --> 39:23.910
Now, I want you to
have fun tonight.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.723
I'll take care
of the kids.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.557
We've got rooms
down the hall.

39:27.590 --> 39:29.057
ANCHORMAN:
...closely throughout
the evening,

39:29.100 --> 39:30.988
as precincts continue
to report results.

39:31.030 --> 39:33.692
While Peter Florrick has kept
a slight but consistent lead...

39:33.730 --> 39:35.493
(cheering, whooping,
applause)

39:41.110 --> 39:43.135
ANCHORMAN: As we continue to
await results, we look back...

39:46.180 --> 39:47.147
You came.

39:47.180 --> 39:48.511
Just for a minute.

39:48.550 --> 39:49.744
Would you like a drink?

39:49.780 --> 39:53.045
Andre told me he talked to you.

39:53.090 --> 39:54.819
I'm sorry.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.987
He can be pretty insensitive.

39:57.020 --> 39:57.918
Come on in.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.951
(cheering, applause)

40:08.130 --> 40:12.066
The opposing lawyer in the case
yesterday, Mr. Thomas--

40:12.110 --> 40:15.932
he hired me to be
a full-time translator.

40:15.980 --> 40:17.106
That's great.

40:17.140 --> 40:18.209
Yeah.

40:18.240 --> 40:21.676
It means being in DC.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.449
Oh, wow. That-That
really is great.

40:23.480 --> 40:24.913
Yeah.

40:24.950 --> 40:27.839
Now when you're in trouble,
you can come to me for help.

40:27.890 --> 40:30.154
(chuckles)

40:33.060 --> 40:35.221
If this were another time.

40:35.260 --> 40:37.899
Yeah.

40:37.930 --> 40:40.990
ANCHORMAN:
...that the State's Attorney's
Office is merely just

40:41.030 --> 40:43.066
a stepping stone
for his higher office...

40:43.100 --> 40:44.067
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

40:44.100 --> 40:46.239
I want to confirm this
before we can report it.

40:46.270 --> 40:48.909
Okay. WBBM can
now project

40:48.940 --> 40:52.103
that Peter Florrick is
the next State's Attorney...

40:52.150 --> 40:54.778
(cheering, applause)

40:58.920 --> 41:00.911
(cheering, upbeat music
in distance)

41:10.060 --> 41:11.527
I couldn't get ahold of you.

41:11.570 --> 41:12.992
I've been trying your cell.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.496
Yes.

41:16.540 --> 41:18.030
I've been ignoring
your calls.

41:18.070 --> 41:19.002
It's not bad news.

41:19.040 --> 41:21.679
I'm a bit busy here, Mr. Wiley.

41:21.710 --> 41:24.031
Yeah, it looks like.

41:24.080 --> 41:26.002
H was feeling bad.

41:26.050 --> 41:27.847
I found out
Blake's interviews were bogus--

41:27.880 --> 41:31.179
just something
he made up.

41:31.220 --> 41:33.017
And you came here
to tell me that?

41:33.050 --> 41:34.187
Yeah.

41:34.220 --> 41:36.154
Why not?

41:36.190 --> 41:38.158
Okay.

41:38.190 --> 41:39.020
Thanks.

41:39.060 --> 41:41.085
It was a rumor
your husband slept with

41:41.130 --> 41:43.997
one of his coworkers
two years ago.

41:44.030 --> 41:47.022
The rumor didn't pan out.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.530
Why are you telling me this?

41:50.570 --> 41:51.798
I wanted you to know.

41:51.840 --> 41:54.104
I mean, it's always best
to know the truth,

41:54.140 --> 41:56.131
no matter how much
it hurts or helps.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.135
Do you believe that?

41:57.180 --> 41:59.045
Yes.

41:59.080 --> 42:00.240
I checked out the woman's name--

42:00.280 --> 42:02.168
the coworker
he supposedly slept with.

42:02.220 --> 42:04.643
There was no one in
the department with that name.

42:04.690 --> 42:05.748
(gasps)

42:07.750 --> 42:09.752
Leela.

42:13.290 --> 42:15.053
But she doesn't exist.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.920
Unless you've
heard of her.

42:16.960 --> 42:18.769
Have you heard of her? Leela?

42:22.740 --> 42:24.731
You all right?

42:31.180 --> 42:32.909
Let me introduce you
to Cook County's

42:32.950 --> 42:34.076
new State's Attorney,
Peter Florrick!

42:34.110 --> 42:36.112
(cheering)

42:44.990 --> 42:46.958
* For he's a jolly good fellow

42:46.990 --> 42:51.120
* For he's
a jolly good fellow *

42:51.160 --> 42:54.197
* Which nobody can deny

42:54.230 --> 42:59.099
* Which nobody can deny,
which nobody can deny... *

42:59.140 --> 43:00.903
