just kind of go over

07:54.741 --> 07:56.174
how you met.

07:56.243 --> 07:59.244
- The year I met Alice
was a very hard year.

07:59.313 --> 08:02.147
That was the year
Hurricane Harvey hit Texas.

08:02.216 --> 08:04.616
Yeah, and I had lost
my entire house.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.017
<i> - Oh.</i>

08:06.086 --> 08:07.519
- And it really
messed up everything,

08:07.588 --> 08:09.020
'cause I dropped out
of high school

08:09.089 --> 08:10.355
'cause I had
really bad anxiety,

08:10.424 --> 08:12.958
and I was really stressed
over that.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.759
And I told Alice, I'm like,
"I kinda feel useless

08:14.828 --> 08:16.595
"'cause I don't have
my high school degree.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.363
I feel like I'm stupid."

08:18.432 --> 08:19.998
She's like, "No, you're not.
You were dealing with stress.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.266
"Everyone goes through stress.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.001
You're not thinking
when you have that."

08:23.070 --> 08:26.838
It eventually got
the worst of me in January.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.274
I was home alone and...

08:30.511 --> 08:31.910
- Wow.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.979
- And I called 911 immediately
'cause I was scared.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.181
They were like, "We have
to take you to a hospital

08:36.250 --> 08:37.449
so you can get checked out."

08:37.518 --> 08:38.683
And they were like,
"You're only allowed

08:38.752 --> 08:40.085
to have one phone call."

08:40.153 --> 08:42.187
This was when
I was dating Pryncess,

08:42.256 --> 08:44.689
and I called Alice instead.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.224
- Wow.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.393
<i> - You chose Alice.</i>
<i> - Yeah.</i>

08:48.462 --> 08:51.530
<i> With Alice, I can just</i>
<i> tell her anything.</i>

08:51.598 --> 08:52.697
And I was crying.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.099
I'm like,
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

08:54.167 --> 08:55.400

08:56.904 --> 08:58.303
- So Alice has really
been there for you.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.505
- Yeah.
The moment before she hung up,

09:00.574 --> 09:01.540
she told me she loved me.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.241
- Aww.
- Wow.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.809

09:04.878 --> 09:06.511

09:06.580 --> 09:08.346

<i> - Yes, definitely.</i>

09:08.415 --> 09:10.248

Do you love her?

09:10.317 --> 09:11.449
- Yes.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.752
- So in--in, like,
a perfect scenario,

09:13.820 --> 09:17.422
would you go to LA and be
in a relationship with Alice?

09:17.491 --> 09:19.991
- Yes, 'cause I want to go
down there for school anyway.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.192
- That's right,
check out CalArts.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.395
- Yeah.
- What about Pryncess?

09:23.463 --> 09:26.164
- Pryncess already said
that they'll be there for me

09:26.233 --> 09:29.000
and support me, like,
no matter what.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.236
- What does Pryncess think
about Alice,

09:31.305 --> 09:32.904
considering
the circumstances and--

09:32.973 --> 09:35.006
- Like, Pryncess was like,

09:35.075 --> 09:36.408
"Well, if someone doesn't want
to video chat with me,

09:36.476 --> 09:38.543
I would just stop talking
to them in general,"

09:38.612 --> 09:40.745
and I'm like, "Well, I'm not
that type of person,"

09:40.814 --> 09:42.147
and they understand that.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.815
- Who's "they"?
Pryncess?

09:43.884 --> 09:45.350
- Pryncess, they--they use
them/they pronouns.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.085
- Got it, yeah.
- Oh.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.920
- Yeah, 'cause they're
genderfluid.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.690
- Okay, so this could
essentially open a door,

09:51.758 --> 09:55.260
or it could close something
and let you move on.

09:55.329 --> 09:56.561
- Yes, exactly.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.664

what Alice looks like.

pretended to be her,

14:57.330 --> 14:58.963

one of her accounts

17:52.272 --> 17:53.738

Facebook page,

17:53.807 --> 17:56.374
and the only comment in--
in any of this

17:56.443 --> 17:57.742
is from this girl, Madi,

17:57.811 --> 17:59.977
so we were like,
"Okay, this girl Madi

18:00.046 --> 18:01.179

18:01.247 --> 18:03.147

to her Instagram.

Wait, wait, wait.

this Instagram down?

18:15.462 --> 18:16.928

- Weird.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.248

- Oh.

18:42.522 --> 18:43.621
- From Madi.

18:43.690 --> 18:44.956
- High school friend.

18:45.024 --> 18:47.291
She did say that Alice
was the person

18:47.360 --> 18:50.027
in the photographs
on the Facebook and everything,

18:50.096 --> 18:52.430
and then we asked her
if she could verify

18:52.499 --> 18:54.098
the phone number that we have,

18:54.167 --> 18:58.469

that that wasn't her number.

she may have changed
her number--

spoken to her

which is good.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.015

that you guys

40:48.880 --> 40:50.113

because I think that
you've been

40:51.583 --> 40:53.149
a really warm person
in her life.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.684

40:54.753 --> 40:56.186

everybody got what they needed.

41:11.203 --> 41:13.236
Is this some type of trap?

This is the spot.

41:16.842 --> 41:20.210
- How long do we stand around?
