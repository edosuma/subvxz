(tires screeching)

00:16.518 --> 00:17.852
(gasps)

00:17.854 --> 00:19.587
Watch out!

00:19.955 --> 00:21.556
WOMAN:
Stop!

00:21.558 --> 00:22.590
(screams)

00:22.592 --> 00:24.559
No!

00:24.561 --> 00:26.094
(crying):
No!

00:26.096 --> 00:28.563
(siren wailing)

00:28.565 --> 00:29.664
(tires screeching)

00:29.666 --> 00:30.665
(siren stops)

00:30.667 --> 00:33.301
Three blocks in ten seconds.

00:33.303 --> 00:35.903
Let me drive more often,
I'll get even faster.

00:35.905 --> 00:37.071
I'll pass.

00:37.073 --> 00:38.172
Hey, there's our guy.

00:38.174 --> 00:39.040
Hey. Police!

00:39.042 --> 00:41.276
Stop what you're doing! Hey!

00:41.278 --> 00:42.477
Hey!
- Come here.

00:42.479 --> 00:44.545
Hey.

00:44.547 --> 00:46.247
We got to chase him? Seriously?

00:46.249 --> 00:47.749
You're the speed demon.
Go get him.

00:47.751 --> 00:49.350
I'm afraid of heights.

00:50.119 --> 00:51.519
(baton extends)

00:54.290 --> 00:55.890
(man screaming)

00:58.127 --> 00:59.961
You're fine. Get up.
Let's get up.

00:59.963 --> 01:01.129
This isn't what it looks like.

01:01.131 --> 01:03.164
Yeah, said the guy
caught red-handed.

01:03.166 --> 01:05.633
But I wasn't breaking in.
This is my girlfriend's place.

01:05.635 --> 01:06.834
Well, then why break in
through her window?

01:06.836 --> 01:08.770
And why run when
we caught you?

01:08.772 --> 01:10.772
Because she's my everything.

01:12.608 --> 01:14.742
Commissioner Reagan, we can't
thank you enough for your time.

01:14.744 --> 01:16.110
And your honesty.

01:16.112 --> 01:18.980
As long as I get a fair shake,
it's been my pleasure.

01:18.982 --> 01:21.349
You seem a little jaded
about giving interviews.

01:21.351 --> 01:22.483
No.

01:22.485 --> 01:24.185
More like experienced.

01:24.187 --> 01:25.620
Don't get me wrong, I don't mind

01:25.622 --> 01:28.156
tough questions,
as long as my answers

01:28.158 --> 01:30.758
are printed accurately,
without shade or shine.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.460
What do you mean,
"shade or shine"?

01:32.462 --> 01:35.596
Well, you know, say I answer,
"That never happened."

01:35.598 --> 01:38.399
And what's printed is,
<i>"'That</i> never happened,'

01:38.401 --> 01:40.268
he said with a sweaty brow."

01:40.270 --> 01:41.836
(chuckles)
Promise.

01:41.838 --> 01:43.504
Well, that's all I ask.

01:43.506 --> 01:46.841
Now, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to turn you back to my DCPI.

01:46.843 --> 01:48.743
(knocking on door)

01:48.745 --> 01:50.978
They're all yours.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.180
I appreciate you
taking the time.

01:52.182 --> 01:53.047
It was my pleasure.

01:53.049 --> 01:55.116
Down with police brutality!

01:55.118 --> 01:58.353
Antifa says no
to the fascism of the NYPD!

01:58.355 --> 02:01.122
Down with police brutality!

02:01.124 --> 02:03.858
The history of the
police department

02:03.860 --> 02:06.694
is stained
with the victim's blood!

02:06.696 --> 02:08.628
Anti-fascists everywhere,

02:08.631 --> 02:10.064
say no to fascism!

02:10.066 --> 02:12.867
Thank police brutality!

02:18.374 --> 02:19.741
Tell us why,
if she's your everything,

02:19.743 --> 02:21.809
you have to sneak around
up on fire escapes?

02:21.811 --> 02:24.178
It's 'cause my parole officer
won't let me see her.

02:24.180 --> 02:25.513
What'd you go to prison for?

02:25.515 --> 02:26.948
Well...
- Gabe had a drug problem.

02:26.950 --> 02:28.116
Had.

02:28.118 --> 02:29.617
But my P.O.,
he's making being out

02:29.619 --> 02:31.319
more of a hell than
it was when I was in.

02:31.321 --> 02:33.221
And this man puts me
in a halfway house a block away

02:33.223 --> 02:34.722
from where I used to score dope.

02:34.724 --> 02:36.991
He controls the way
I spend all my money.

02:36.993 --> 02:38.526
He's constantly changing
the curfew all the time,

02:38.528 --> 02:40.027
and it's-- I just...

02:40.029 --> 02:42.764
And he says if he so much as
talks to me, it's a violation.

02:42.766 --> 02:44.432
He even made me
change my locks.

02:44.434 --> 02:45.466
Why would he care about you?

02:45.468 --> 02:47.034
Technically,
I'm one of Gabe's victims.

02:47.036 --> 02:48.302
Long time ago.

02:48.304 --> 02:51.439
He pawned my jewelry,
but he's changed now,

02:51.441 --> 02:52.840
and he's gonna stay clean.

02:52.842 --> 02:55.276
That's unless I can't see her.

02:55.278 --> 02:59.781
Like I said, Liza,
she's my rock.

02:59.783 --> 03:01.249
If you are forbidden
from contacting her,

03:01.251 --> 03:03.785
then you are in violation,
and we screwed up

03:03.787 --> 03:05.420
by bringing her down here.
No, no, no.

03:05.422 --> 03:07.321
Please, okay? I-I can't
go back to jail.

03:07.323 --> 03:09.190
You can't tell him.
No, we can't.

03:09.192 --> 03:11.592
- Thank you.
- Because we don't have a name.

03:11.594 --> 03:13.027
Listen, if you are really
so sure

03:13.029 --> 03:14.629
that your parole officer's
out of line,

03:14.631 --> 03:16.164
then you give us a name.

03:18.901 --> 03:21.636
Don Voorhees.

03:21.638 --> 03:24.238
How about, you walk away
and then we'll walk away.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.474
But you come back here again,
you could be arrested.

03:26.476 --> 03:27.775
Do you understand?

03:31.713 --> 03:33.714
Walk away, Mr. Harris.

03:48.330 --> 03:49.363
(camera snaps)
- Morning.

03:49.365 --> 03:50.531
CIS DETECTIVE:
Detectives.

03:50.533 --> 03:51.899
Glad you could join the fun.

03:51.901 --> 03:53.301
Yeah, looks like fun.

03:53.303 --> 03:55.236
What the hell does Collision
Investigation want with us?

03:55.238 --> 03:57.104
One male, DOA,
pinned under the car.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.406
This was intentional?

03:58.408 --> 03:59.907
Most of the wits were
too shook up to notice,

03:59.909 --> 04:03.010
but one says it definitely was.
Is that right?

04:03.012 --> 04:04.912
And you're on a first-name
basis with him, Detective.

04:04.914 --> 04:06.614
Come again?

04:09.718 --> 04:11.018
That's my grandfather.

04:11.020 --> 04:13.154
I'll be back.

04:13.156 --> 04:14.489
No, I can't leave my husband.

04:14.491 --> 04:16.958
They just have to take you
to the hospital to make sure

04:16.959 --> 04:18.159
that you and your baby are okay.

04:18.161 --> 04:19.360
I don't...
- Just...

04:19.362 --> 04:21.896
I'm not leaving.
Just, just try to relax.

04:21.898 --> 04:22.864
Gramps.

04:22.866 --> 04:24.165
What the hell's
going on?

04:24.167 --> 04:25.700
How'd you get here?

04:25.702 --> 04:27.435
What-- we were up next to catch.
You okay?

04:27.437 --> 04:28.273
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:28.297 --> 04:29.764
What do you mean you're fine?
Your hand's bleeding.

04:29.765 --> 04:31.172
- What the hell happened to you?
- Ah, it's nothing.

04:31.174 --> 04:33.841
I'm better off than
her dead husband over there.

04:33.843 --> 04:37.512
Yeah. Highway says
you think it was intentional.

04:37.514 --> 04:39.647
The guy went straight for him.

04:39.649 --> 04:41.749
And after he got him,
he jumped out,

04:41.751 --> 04:44.619
ran off... smiling.

04:44.621 --> 04:46.187
This was murder.

04:46.189 --> 04:48.656
(sighs)
Ay, ay, ay.

Need anything else,

05:25.260 --> 05:26.092
just yell.

05:26.094 --> 05:27.059
Will do.

05:27.061 --> 05:28.094
Thank you.

05:28.096 --> 05:30.196
Okay, run it down
for me, Gramps.

05:30.198 --> 05:31.964
First let's go see
what your partner found.

05:31.966 --> 05:34.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is a crime scene, okay?

05:34.402 --> 05:36.469
And you're not a detective,
you're just a witness.

05:36.471 --> 05:38.738
Well, so then let's get in
your car and drive around.

05:38.740 --> 05:40.606
We find the perp,
I make the I.D.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.742
No, it already went out
over the air, Gramps.

05:42.744 --> 05:44.377
Based on the description
you gave.

05:44.379 --> 05:46.212
Now, will you tell me
what you're doing in the city?

05:46.214 --> 05:47.480
I was just buying
a lottery ticket

05:47.482 --> 05:49.515
at my lucky place
down the block.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.207
Well, the wife is a lucky woman

05:51.209 --> 05:52.976
that you came along
and pulled her out of the way.

05:52.978 --> 05:54.911
I just reacted.

05:54.913 --> 05:56.779
I mean, if I'd had
a second to think,

05:56.781 --> 06:00.416
I probably would've run the
other way like everybody else.

06:00.418 --> 06:02.452
Not likely. You did good.

06:02.454 --> 06:04.120
Hey. Did you...
You get the I.D.?

06:04.122 --> 06:05.788
Victim is Jerry Simmons.

06:05.790 --> 06:07.890
Lives nearby, Lex and 38th.

06:07.892 --> 06:09.626
I'm guessing our
perp stole the car.

06:09.628 --> 06:11.027
I found this on the floorboard.
I'll...

06:11.029 --> 06:13.396
take that.

06:13.398 --> 06:14.864
It's a code grabber.

06:14.866 --> 06:17.800
These car thieves use these
to steal the cars now

06:17.802 --> 06:19.569
that have
keyless entries.

06:19.571 --> 06:20.703
What am I, an idiot?

06:20.705 --> 06:23.539
Well, I didn't realize
you kept up, Gramps.

06:23.541 --> 06:25.575
Yeah, well, you better
dust that thing for prints.

06:25.577 --> 06:28.044
And then do a background
check on the Vic,

06:28.046 --> 06:29.412
because dollars
to donuts,

06:29.414 --> 06:30.680
he knows the killer.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.615
Thanks for your help,
Commissioner.

06:32.617 --> 06:33.916
Oh, right.

06:33.918 --> 06:35.251
I'm just the witness.

06:35.253 --> 06:37.220
Mm-hmm. And New York's
finest detective

06:37.222 --> 06:38.855
is already on the case.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.256
And his grandson.

06:40.258 --> 06:41.758
(laughs)

06:41.760 --> 06:44.027
Very funny. Very funny.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.029
Laugh it up.
Now, can we find

06:46.031 --> 06:48.598
the esteemed former commissioner
a ride home, please?

06:48.600 --> 06:51.234
(chuckling)

06:51.236 --> 06:53.202
And just what
do you call vetting?

06:53.204 --> 06:55.304
Okay, it was a light vetting.
Because?

06:55.306 --> 06:57.240
Because for starters...
She works

06:57.242 --> 06:58.675
at a college newspaper, Garrett.

06:58.677 --> 07:01.177
You'd think you'd give it
extra attention,

07:01.179 --> 07:03.079
given the climate
on campuses today,

07:03.081 --> 07:04.781
especially the one she's at.

07:04.783 --> 07:07.016
What I was going to say was...
And where is she?

07:07.018 --> 07:08.184
Cooling her
jets in a cell

07:08.186 --> 07:09.385
down in Major Case.
Well, I don't want

07:09.387 --> 07:11.087
to hear any crap
about freedom of the press

07:11.089 --> 07:12.822
or jailing reporters.

07:12.824 --> 07:14.857
- I wasn't gonna say anything about...
- What we should've done

07:14.859 --> 07:15.992
is accidentally knocked her head
against the bars

07:15.994 --> 07:17.527
a couple of times on her way in.

07:17.529 --> 07:18.628
All right,
let's not even go there.

07:18.630 --> 07:19.829
FRANK:
She comes into our house

07:19.831 --> 07:21.464
spouting that Antifa crap

07:21.466 --> 07:24.367
and defaces the NYPD flag.

07:24.369 --> 07:26.202
Can I speak?

07:26.204 --> 07:27.437
(sighs)

07:27.439 --> 07:29.105
The student newspaper
at Columbia

07:29.107 --> 07:32.208
disavows any and all actions
by Chrissie Watkins,

07:32.210 --> 07:33.676
because she never worked there.

07:33.678 --> 07:34.711
She had credentials.

07:34.713 --> 07:36.212
I vouchered them.

07:36.214 --> 07:37.413
Must have printed
them up herself.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.481
So we could add forgery

07:38.483 --> 07:40.016
to the charges.

07:40.018 --> 07:41.417
What kind of ship
we running, Garrett?

07:41.419 --> 07:43.219
The same one we run every time
a friend of your office

07:43.221 --> 07:44.287
calls me for a favor.

07:44.289 --> 07:45.321
A friend of my office?

07:45.323 --> 07:46.622
What friend of my office?

07:46.624 --> 07:48.458
Nicky Reagan.

07:59.737 --> 08:01.170
It's all a blur.

08:01.172 --> 08:04.941
One minute, we're walking down
the street-- thank you--

08:04.943 --> 08:06.943
and we were taking a walk.

08:06.945 --> 08:10.513
Then, this car came out
of nowhere, and that man

08:10.515 --> 08:13.583
pulled me out of the way, and...

08:13.585 --> 08:14.984
(whispers):
Jerry's dead.

08:14.986 --> 08:18.020
Were you able to get a look
at the driver's face?

08:18.022 --> 08:21.591
Your husband,
has he ever been threatened,

08:21.593 --> 08:22.859
does he have any enemies?

08:22.861 --> 08:24.761
No, everybody loved Jerry.

08:24.879 --> 08:28.247
We, um, found a real estate
license in his wallet.

08:28.249 --> 08:29.915
Is that what he did
for a living?

08:29.917 --> 08:31.049
- Real estate?
- Yes.

08:31.051 --> 08:34.553
He, um, he owns a small firm
in Greenpoint.

08:34.554 --> 08:38.323
Okay. He have any disgruntled
clients, employees, tenants?

08:38.325 --> 08:39.924
I don't know.

08:39.927 --> 08:43.261
We really didn't talk
about work, you know?

08:43.264 --> 08:47.232
We just talked about
preparing for our family.

08:47.234 --> 08:48.634
How can I raise

08:48.636 --> 08:50.736
a family by myself?

08:50.738 --> 08:52.738
Look.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.573
You got to hang in there.

08:54.575 --> 08:55.908
That's all
I can tell you.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.242
You hang in there,

08:57.244 --> 08:58.577
and I promise you,
I'm gonna find out

08:58.579 --> 09:00.078
who was driving that car, okay?

09:02.882 --> 09:04.950
Let's get you home.

09:08.688 --> 09:10.989
Officer Cosgrove,
could you, uh, see to it

09:10.991 --> 09:12.291
that Ms. Simmons gets home okay?

09:12.293 --> 09:13.425
- Of course.
- Thanks.

09:13.427 --> 09:15.394
Right this way.

09:15.396 --> 09:16.929
Anything?

09:16.931 --> 09:18.897
Only the I.D.
of our killer.

09:18.899 --> 09:20.198
Are you joking?

09:20.200 --> 09:22.968
The car's airbag deployed,
so CSU found skin cells

09:22.970 --> 09:24.803
from the driver's
face on it.

09:24.805 --> 09:26.038
Those gave them DNA,
and the DNA...

09:26.040 --> 09:27.839
Hit in the system.
More like 50.

09:27.841 --> 09:31.410
Fraud, grand larceny,
burglary, robbery.

09:31.412 --> 09:34.246
Name is, uh, Tim Streebinsky.

09:34.248 --> 09:35.747
The Streeber? Let me see that.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.516
You know him?
- Yeah.

09:37.518 --> 09:39.017
Collared this guy
at least 20 times.

09:39.019 --> 09:40.619
He's a degenerate gambler
who rips people off

09:40.621 --> 09:41.887
to pay off his gambling debts.

09:41.889 --> 09:44.089
But he's a hoot.

09:44.091 --> 09:45.824
I mean, even in cuffs
in the back of a car,

09:45.826 --> 09:47.326
this guy kept us all laughing.

09:47.328 --> 09:50.162
Well, now your funny felon
has graduated to murderer.

09:50.164 --> 09:51.463
Just to make sure,
we got an address?

09:51.465 --> 09:53.699
Uh, 440 Vandervoort.

09:53.701 --> 09:55.667
That's The Streeber.

09:55.669 --> 09:57.903
Mr. Reagan,

09:57.905 --> 09:59.371
we owe you our lives.

09:59.373 --> 10:01.707
I'm just happy that you
and your baby are okay.

10:01.709 --> 10:03.709
What's he doing here?

10:08.581 --> 10:12.217
Partner, could you do me a favor
and assist Officer Cosgrove

10:12.219 --> 10:15.120
in assisting Ms. Simmons
out of the building, please?

10:15.122 --> 10:16.555
For real this time.

10:16.557 --> 10:18.857
(clears throat)

10:18.859 --> 10:20.225
What brings you down, Gramps?

10:20.227 --> 10:22.194
Oh, just thought I'd stop by
and see if you needed my help.

10:22.196 --> 10:23.729
Oh, well, thanks.

10:23.731 --> 10:26.231
Not by interfering
with my case, though.

10:26.233 --> 10:27.632
How is that interfering?

10:27.634 --> 10:29.034
Well, she is a witness.

10:29.036 --> 10:31.803
So, I'm a witness, too,
as you keep reminding me.

10:31.805 --> 10:34.673
And besides,
she was the one who stopped me

10:34.675 --> 10:36.208
on my way in to thank me.

10:36.210 --> 10:38.310
Fair enough.

10:38.312 --> 10:39.978
- So, if that's interfering...
- I apologize.

10:39.980 --> 10:44.016
You're not interfering
with my case.

10:44.018 --> 10:44.883
So?

10:44.885 --> 10:46.251
So what?

10:46.253 --> 10:47.886
So what's up with the case?

10:47.888 --> 10:50.822
Well, I'm not really at liberty
to discuss that with you.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.157
(sighs)
- But...

10:52.159 --> 10:54.159
since you came
all the way down here,

10:54.161 --> 10:56.128
we were able to
identify the driver.

10:56.130 --> 10:59.164
Ah-ha, you got prints off
that doohickey like I said, huh?

10:59.166 --> 11:02.234
No, we didn't get prints
off of any doohickey.

11:02.236 --> 11:04.002
We got DNA off the airbag.

11:04.004 --> 11:05.470
That's a new technique
we use nowadays.

11:05.472 --> 11:07.506
Oh, don't patronize me.
I'm not patronizing you.

11:07.508 --> 11:09.808
I'm just telling you
what we did.

11:11.411 --> 11:12.711
And now I got to go.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.713
So, the driver,
does he live nearby?

11:14.715 --> 11:18.283
Yes, he lives nearby,
and you can't go with me.

11:18.285 --> 11:19.418
Who said I wanted to?

11:19.420 --> 11:21.753
So you don't want to go with me?
Course I do.

11:21.755 --> 11:23.455
Right. And no.

11:23.457 --> 11:25.557
See ya later.

11:30.163 --> 11:32.130
I'm just saying,
it had the ring of truth.

11:32.132 --> 11:34.599
Well, you ask me, it had
the ring of excuses.

11:34.601 --> 11:36.435
Then you weren't
really listening.

11:36.437 --> 11:39.037
We get a sob story every
time we make a collar.

11:39.039 --> 11:41.173
Whatever jam they're in,
it's never their fault.

11:41.175 --> 11:43.708
Eddie Janko, I am detecting
a touch of cynicism.

11:43.710 --> 11:45.610
Well, you grow up
with a con artist

11:45.612 --> 11:47.079
who says he loves you
one minute,

11:47.081 --> 11:49.014
and then he empties
your bank account the next.

11:49.016 --> 11:50.182
We didn't have a piggy bank.

11:50.184 --> 11:51.783
My dad had us
open savings accounts.

11:51.785 --> 11:53.919
You people ever do
anything wrong?

11:53.921 --> 11:55.754
You people?
- Yeah.

11:55.756 --> 11:56.788
The churchgoing,

11:56.790 --> 11:59.024
"eating Sunday dinner together"
Reagans.

11:59.026 --> 12:01.526
I can't think of one.

12:02.295 --> 12:04.663
Officers Janko,
Reagan?

12:04.665 --> 12:06.898
Yeah, Reagan.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.700
Don Voorhees.

12:08.702 --> 12:09.968
Gabe Harris's P.O.

12:09.970 --> 12:11.703
Oh, so you did
nab him today.

12:11.705 --> 12:13.405
Who told you that?

12:13.407 --> 12:14.873
I dropped in
to his halfway house.

12:14.875 --> 12:17.109
I heard his roommate talking
about how two unis

12:17.111 --> 12:18.810
nabbed Gabe at his
girlfriend's apartment.

12:18.812 --> 12:20.378
Of course, when
Gabe walked in,

12:20.380 --> 12:22.514
he denied it up and down
and sideways.

12:22.516 --> 12:25.217
Skells, can't believe a word
out of their mouths, right?

12:25.219 --> 12:26.852
Peas in a pod.

12:26.854 --> 12:28.420
The roommate had it wrong.

12:28.422 --> 12:29.421
Come again?

12:29.423 --> 12:31.123
We weren't at anyone's
apartment today.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.258
So he just magically
pulled your names out of a hat?

12:33.260 --> 12:34.659
What she means is,
we did bump into Gabe today,

12:34.661 --> 12:37.095
but it was at 136th
and Amsterdam.

12:37.097 --> 12:38.463
We stopped him for jaywalking.

12:38.465 --> 12:39.431
You summonsed him?

12:39.433 --> 12:40.665
No.
- Mm-mm.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.567
Uh, just like every other clown
in this city,

12:42.569 --> 12:44.769
Gabe was making a video
of himself while he was walking.

12:44.771 --> 12:46.638
He played it back
and showed us that the light

12:46.640 --> 12:48.340
was actually green
when he crossed,

12:48.342 --> 12:49.541
so we had to let him go.

12:49.543 --> 12:51.042
No harm, no foul.

12:51.044 --> 12:54.613
Yeah. Well... (chuckles)

12:54.615 --> 12:57.182
He'll violate in some other way
soon enough. They always do.

12:57.184 --> 12:58.984
And as fellow

12:58.986 --> 13:01.553
law enforcement officers,
I thank you both for your time

13:01.555 --> 13:03.321
and your service.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.527
That guy?

13:08.529 --> 13:09.561
Yeah.

13:09.563 --> 13:11.129
Fellow law enforcement officers?

13:11.131 --> 13:12.531
- Yeah.
- You starting to hear

13:12.533 --> 13:13.665
a ring of truth yet?

13:13.667 --> 13:16.735
Having met him...

13:16.737 --> 13:18.870
you got a point.

13:24.510 --> 13:26.478
(heavy metal music playing)
No surprise.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.547
Streeber hasn't moved up
in the world much.

13:28.549 --> 13:31.149
Still in the same dump
he was in 15 years ago.

13:31.151 --> 13:34.352
Smells like someone's still
cooking the same casserole, too.

13:35.922 --> 13:38.723
Tim Streebinsky!
Police. Open up.

13:38.725 --> 13:41.393
That god-awful music's
coming from inside,

13:41.395 --> 13:42.527
so somebody's here.

13:42.529 --> 13:44.362
Well, maybe he's making
a move for the window.

13:46.666 --> 13:48.833
(music blaring)

14:05.101 --> 14:07.002
Got to say, I was kind of
looking forward

14:07.004 --> 14:08.303
to meeting The Streeber.

14:09.405 --> 14:11.039
- I'm sorry he offed himself.
- That is,

14:11.041 --> 14:12.407
if he actually did off himself.

14:12.409 --> 14:14.543
Pretty sure he's not faking.
No, I mean

14:14.545 --> 14:15.944
if he actually
committed suicide.

14:15.946 --> 14:17.346
It's the receipt
from his takeout.

14:17.348 --> 14:19.014
It was ordered
less than two hours ago.

14:19.016 --> 14:20.983
Last meal?
- Last meal?

14:20.985 --> 14:23.518
He only took two bites.
Besides, I know The Streeber.

14:23.520 --> 14:25.020
I mean, the guy
was always happy.

14:25.022 --> 14:26.455
Even when he got collared,

14:26.457 --> 14:27.556
he had a smile on his face.

14:27.558 --> 14:28.824
He wouldn't do this.
- Reagan,

14:28.826 --> 14:29.891
people get depressed.

14:29.893 --> 14:31.860
And people get murdered.

14:31.862 --> 14:33.095
Anything unusual over there?

14:33.097 --> 14:34.997
Like, other than the fact
that he killed himself?

14:34.999 --> 14:39.534
Like maybe someone staged this
to make it look like a suicide?

14:39.536 --> 14:42.337
Well, there's bruising on
his arms, probably track marks.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.805
Okay, but The Streeber
was a gambler.

14:43.807 --> 14:45.073
He wasn't a junkie.

14:45.075 --> 14:47.009
Is it possible
he got the bruises

14:47.011 --> 14:49.077
by someone manhandling him
when they put him up there?

14:49.079 --> 14:51.346
At this point,
it's inconclusive.

14:51.348 --> 14:52.914
See?

14:52.916 --> 14:55.117
She just said it's inconclusive.
Inconclusive,

14:55.119 --> 14:56.752
meaning not conclusive
in either direction.

14:56.754 --> 14:58.920
So we're gonna treat this
as a homicide.

14:58.922 --> 15:01.690
Hey, box up any personal papers
and electronics, all right?

15:01.692 --> 15:03.225
We got to go through it?

15:03.227 --> 15:04.593
No, I'm gonna go through it.

15:04.595 --> 15:06.828
You're gonna dig deeper
on Jerry Simmons.

15:12.468 --> 15:14.803
She cooked a whole Antifa
recipe: the fake blood,

15:14.805 --> 15:17.639
the sloganeering,
the grandstanding.

15:17.641 --> 15:18.940
(sighs)
- Who is she?

15:18.942 --> 15:20.842
Chrissie's a classmate.

15:20.844 --> 15:22.411
Who is she to you?

15:22.413 --> 15:24.012
A friend.

15:24.014 --> 15:26.381
A friend?

15:26.383 --> 15:29.785
Who's had some troubles,
but who I was trying to help.

15:29.787 --> 15:31.520
What kind of troubles?

15:31.522 --> 15:36.358
She kind of faked a hate crime
against herself.

15:36.360 --> 15:39.661
She kind of faked a hate crime?

15:39.663 --> 15:41.596
I thought she
was past that.

15:41.598 --> 15:43.198
She said she was done
with the disruption

15:43.200 --> 15:44.433
and activism and all of that.

15:44.435 --> 15:48.236
So, this friend,
who kind of faked a hate crime,

15:48.238 --> 15:49.671
you took at her word?

15:49.673 --> 15:50.939
People deserve a second chance.

15:50.941 --> 15:52.441
I mean, how many times
have you...

15:52.443 --> 15:53.742
Lots.

15:53.744 --> 15:56.311
But I checked 'em out first.

15:56.313 --> 15:59.681
I'm sorry. I am.

15:59.683 --> 16:01.316
(sighs)

16:02.719 --> 16:05.721
How'd she play you?

16:05.723 --> 16:07.422
Think, Nicky.

16:10.426 --> 16:12.828
She reached out,

16:12.830 --> 16:16.364
said she was switching
to a journalism major, that...

16:18.534 --> 16:21.737
...that she needed a strong
sample for the school paper.

16:21.739 --> 16:23.905
Well, she got one.
- (sighs)

16:23.907 --> 16:26.274
I feel like such an idiot.

16:26.276 --> 16:29.377
Then remember that feeling
and learn from it.

16:29.379 --> 16:32.414
So what happens now?

16:32.416 --> 16:34.716
Well, she has
a court appearance next week.

16:34.718 --> 16:36.017
She's gonna be charged?

16:36.019 --> 16:38.754
You bet your ass that little
brownshirt's being charged.

16:38.756 --> 16:40.789
No, of-of course she should,
it's just...

16:40.791 --> 16:41.890
Just what?

16:41.892 --> 16:45.594
It was a symbolic action.

16:47.497 --> 16:51.266
Nicky, where are you?

16:51.268 --> 16:53.235
Look around.

16:53.237 --> 16:56.338
I think you're
taking this personally.

16:59.041 --> 17:04.780
A flag, just like that one,
draped your uncle's coffin.

17:04.781 --> 17:07.915
Yeah, it's personal.

17:10.219 --> 17:12.820
To all of us
and to both of us.

17:19.796 --> 17:21.530
You know, maybe The Streeber

17:21.531 --> 17:23.064
was turning over
a new leaf after all.

17:23.066 --> 17:24.432
How so?

17:24.434 --> 17:26.667
Well, these pay stubs
make it look like he went legit

17:26.670 --> 17:29.104
a few years back working for
some land development company.

17:29.106 --> 17:30.272
Vangelis Properties?

17:30.274 --> 17:33.275
Yeah, Vangelis Properties.
How do you know?

17:33.277 --> 17:34.543
The dead husband's e-mails

17:34.545 --> 17:36.978
show his real estate firm
received financial backing

17:36.980 --> 17:39.214
from Vangelis Properties
for a development

17:39.216 --> 17:40.682
at the Brooklyn shipyards.
- Huh.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.818
Then, half a million
went missing.

17:42.820 --> 17:45.453
Mario Vangelis ain't someone
you steal money from.

17:45.455 --> 17:47.556
Who is this Mario Vangelis?

17:47.558 --> 17:50.091
Money launderer,
loan shark, slumlord,

17:50.093 --> 17:52.027
your basic nightmare.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.195
Back when I was at OCCB,

17:53.197 --> 17:54.930
we tried tying him
to a couple murders

17:54.932 --> 17:56.364
and got nowhere.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.466
The guy's got trapdoors
everywhere he goes.

17:58.468 --> 18:01.837
Okay, so then,
is it possible, maybe,

18:01.839 --> 18:03.672
that The Streeber

18:03.674 --> 18:07.609
took a job with Vangelis,
working off his gambling debts

18:07.611 --> 18:10.011
and got tapped for the hit on Simmons?
And got a staged

18:10.013 --> 18:11.379
suicide as a thank-you?

18:11.381 --> 18:12.647
Hey, call it a hunch.

18:12.649 --> 18:15.016
You're really gonna go poke
this bear on just a hunch?

18:15.018 --> 18:16.918
Well, you just said you
investigated Vangelis

18:16.920 --> 18:18.320
for murder yourself, didn't you?

18:18.322 --> 18:20.956
He'll lawyer up
before you can even say hello.

18:20.958 --> 18:24.059
Then we won't say hello.
Let's go.

18:28.764 --> 18:30.632
Every time
I'm in the steam room,

18:30.634 --> 18:32.901
this woman waddles in
without a towel on,

18:32.903 --> 18:36.771
and she plants herself
spread-eagle across from me.

18:36.773 --> 18:39.708
It's like a werewolf
coming through the fog.

18:39.710 --> 18:41.142
Tell the gym's owner.

18:41.144 --> 18:44.546
She is the gym's owner.
(phone rings)

18:44.548 --> 18:46.214
Reagan.

18:46.216 --> 18:49.684
Oh, hey, how you doing?
- (sighs)

18:49.686 --> 18:51.953
Okay. Sit tight,
we're on our way.

18:53.623 --> 18:54.623
Gabe wants to meet.

18:54.625 --> 18:55.891
Well, how does he
have your number?

18:55.893 --> 18:57.259
I gave it
to him yesterday.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.194
'Cause something told me he
had more to say about Voorhees.

18:59.196 --> 19:01.630
- That he didn't want Liza to hear.
- Exactly.

19:01.632 --> 19:02.864
He's working at Falbank Park.

19:02.866 --> 19:05.467
Ooh, that's, like,
three blocks away.

19:05.469 --> 19:07.302
Let's see if I can beat
yesterday's record.

19:07.304 --> 19:08.670
(siren wails)
Did I not mention

19:08.672 --> 19:10.472
how your driving
makes me carsick?

19:10.474 --> 19:12.073
(chuckles)

19:13.442 --> 19:15.577
Mario Vangelis.

19:15.579 --> 19:18.246
Cheap suits,

19:18.248 --> 19:21.082
crap-eating grins,
let me guess, NYPD?

19:21.084 --> 19:22.918
Yeah, you know
the drill.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.619
Yeah, well,
apparently you don't.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.955
Talk to my lawyer.
He does all the talking for me.

19:26.957 --> 19:29.925
Oh, sort of like The Streeber
does all your killings for you?

19:29.927 --> 19:30.992
Who?

19:30.994 --> 19:32.928
The lackey you made
kill Jerry Simmons.

19:32.930 --> 19:34.329
We've met before.

19:34.331 --> 19:35.864
And the pleasure was all yours.

19:35.866 --> 19:38.066
Nah, I get no pleasure
in being hassled

19:38.068 --> 19:39.668
for things that
I didn't do.

19:39.670 --> 19:41.403
So, where'd we meet, sweetheart?

19:41.405 --> 19:43.438
I was with the
Organized Crime Control Bureau.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.572
You were the organized criminal.

19:44.574 --> 19:45.941
(chuckles)

19:45.943 --> 19:47.909
I always liked her.
- Me, too.

19:47.911 --> 19:49.411
Look, you're gonna
sit down with us,

19:49.413 --> 19:51.079
so, why don't we
stop wasting time

19:51.081 --> 19:52.647
and get it over with, okay?
She comes with?

19:52.649 --> 19:54.015
Wouldn't miss it.

19:54.017 --> 19:56.918
I'll give you 20 minutes.
Your place or mine?

19:56.920 --> 19:58.653
Ours. Let's go.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.322
Come on.

20:04.827 --> 20:05.961
- Gabe.
- Hey.

20:05.963 --> 20:08.363
Oh, that was quick.

20:08.365 --> 20:09.731
What'd you want
to tell us?

20:09.733 --> 20:10.665
Look, I've, uh,

20:10.667 --> 20:12.667
been locked up,
so it's safe to say

20:12.669 --> 20:14.703
I've done some things
I'm not too proud of,

20:14.705 --> 20:15.837
but this guy Voorhees,

20:15.839 --> 20:17.706
he keeps pushing me
further down that road.

20:17.708 --> 20:19.908
Like?
- Like, when I was using,

20:19.910 --> 20:21.843
I got good
at breaking into places.

20:21.845 --> 20:24.512
But now Voorhees is making me
do all that stuff for him.

20:24.514 --> 20:25.780
He's making me

20:25.782 --> 20:28.450
plant evidence on other parolees
so he can violate them.

20:28.452 --> 20:31.119
Sometimes it's just
to rip people off.

20:31.121 --> 20:32.320
What am I supposed to do?

20:32.322 --> 20:33.488
This guy's got me
by the balls,

20:33.490 --> 20:34.456
you understand?

20:34.458 --> 20:35.957
I-I don't have any option.
Gabe Harris.

20:35.959 --> 20:37.325
Hands behind your back.

20:37.327 --> 20:38.660
Voorhees. What are
you doing here?

20:38.662 --> 20:40.462
Well, I could ask you
the same question.

20:40.464 --> 20:42.497
- We're patrol officers. We patrol.
- (handcuffs tighten)

20:42.499 --> 20:44.933
And Gabe just failed
his last urine test.

20:44.935 --> 20:47.268
- What? I didn't fail, all right? I'm clean.
- It's a shocker, I know.

20:47.270 --> 20:48.803
I'm clean.
Save it for your hearing.

20:48.805 --> 20:50.905
Look, Voorhees, the way
Gabe tells it, he is clean.

20:50.907 --> 20:52.440
Yeah, we believe him.

20:52.442 --> 20:55.477
Well, you can tell that to
the squirrels. Come on, skell.

20:59.949 --> 21:02.484
The son of a bitch is trying
to keep us from talking to Gabe.

21:02.486 --> 21:04.886
Yeah, what are we
gonna do about it?

21:07.790 --> 21:12.127
So, how long did Tim Streebinsky
work for Vangelis Properties?

21:12.129 --> 21:13.995
- My client declines to answer that.
- Okay.

21:13.997 --> 21:15.363
When did you start to suspect

21:15.365 --> 21:16.898
that Jerry Simmons
had ripped you off?

21:16.900 --> 21:18.566
My client declines
to answer that.

21:18.568 --> 21:21.202
This isn't talking;
it's stonewalling.

21:21.204 --> 21:23.238
This is a cautious man
being cautions.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.973
Well, it's a waste of time.

21:24.975 --> 21:26.775
We agree on something.

21:26.777 --> 21:27.842
Mario, stop talking.

21:27.844 --> 21:29.978
I got a soft spot for her.

21:29.980 --> 21:33.048
Look, all I know,
some mook we hired to park cars

21:33.050 --> 21:34.349
offed himself.

21:34.351 --> 21:35.850
The fact that I know
the guy he killed

21:35.852 --> 21:38.253
in a car accident,
it's a total coincidence.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.288
End of story.
Not another word.

21:40.290 --> 21:43.224
No, please, let him keep
talking himself into a hole.

21:43.226 --> 21:45.160
That's not gonna happen.
Look, sweetheart...

21:45.162 --> 21:46.394
Detective.

21:46.396 --> 21:48.196
Detective Sweetheart,

21:48.198 --> 21:49.264
I came in here
as a courtesy,

21:49.266 --> 21:51.066
but I'm not feeling
much courtesy.

21:51.068 --> 21:53.401
You know what I'm saying?

21:53.403 --> 21:56.404
So our time has drawn
to a close.

22:00.910 --> 22:03.078
You know, I like
you for this.

22:03.080 --> 22:06.448
And when I like something,
I work hard till I get it.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.016
You two can sleep on that.

22:08.018 --> 22:11.119
Oh, I'll sleep like a baby.

22:13.889 --> 22:15.890
Go ahead, say it.

22:15.892 --> 22:17.258
It was a waste of time.

22:17.260 --> 22:19.627
I already did.

22:25.801 --> 22:28.103
Oh, you can't be serious.

22:28.105 --> 22:29.637
What are you doing down here?

22:29.639 --> 22:31.139
I heard you brought
someone in.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.474
You heard? From where?

22:32.476 --> 22:34.209
From somebody down here maybe?

22:34.211 --> 22:35.610
Former PCs hear things.

22:35.612 --> 22:37.545
Former PCs may hear things,

22:37.547 --> 22:39.581
but most former PCs
wouldn't come down here

22:39.583 --> 22:41.149
and start meddling
when they hear things.

22:41.151 --> 22:42.450
How the hell can you call

22:42.452 --> 22:44.419
looking through a
one-way mirror meddling?

22:44.421 --> 22:45.720
'Cause that's what it is,
meddling.

22:45.722 --> 22:47.522
Guys, can we
do this in private?

22:47.524 --> 22:49.424
No, we're gonna
do it right here,

22:49.426 --> 22:51.359
in front of the whole squad
room. Since my grandfather

22:51.361 --> 22:52.727
decides he wants
to babysit me

22:52.729 --> 22:55.430
in front of the whole squad
room-- what is it, Gramps?

22:55.432 --> 22:56.965
You wanted to come down
and tell me that

22:56.967 --> 22:59.334
I did it all wrong? That I
screwed it up? Is that it?

22:59.336 --> 23:00.401
You're putting
words in my mouth.

23:00.403 --> 23:02.303
So it's a no?
I didn't screw it up?

23:02.305 --> 23:03.571
Well, I might have
tried working him

23:03.573 --> 23:04.672
without the lawyer
being around.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.908
Oh, and where do you
suggest I do that?

23:06.910 --> 23:08.676
Down by the waterfront,
Gramps?

23:08.678 --> 23:10.879
I'm sorry, as much
as I would love to,

23:10.881 --> 23:13.114
we can't do things the way
you did in the old days.

23:13.116 --> 23:14.382
Yeah, well, in the old
days, we accepted help

23:14.384 --> 23:15.517
without getting
pissy about it.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.285
- Mm-hmm.
- Especially when we needed it.

23:17.287 --> 23:20.688
Oh! I don't need it.
I have this under control.

23:20.690 --> 23:22.223
Then how come this
guy walks out of here?

23:22.225 --> 23:26.027
He... the same way you're
about to walk out of here.

23:26.029 --> 23:28.396
Good-bye. Don't come back.

23:28.398 --> 23:29.664
What are you gonna
do, arrest me?

23:29.666 --> 23:30.999
(sighs)

23:31.001 --> 23:32.734
It would be the first one
you made in this case.

23:32.736 --> 23:36.171
I love you, Gramps,
but go home. Please.

23:36.173 --> 23:37.605
There's no place
I'd rather be.

23:37.607 --> 23:40.008
Fine.
- Fine.

23:41.043 --> 23:42.644
Out of my way.

23:55.702 --> 23:57.269
(exhales)

23:57.271 --> 23:58.679
I never said not to speak up.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.112
Not in so many words, no.

24:00.114 --> 24:01.681
Not in any words.

24:01.683 --> 24:03.416
And there's a difference between
speaking up and butting in.

24:03.418 --> 24:05.918
Speaking up about things that
people don't want to hear?

24:05.920 --> 24:07.186
As in?

24:08.388 --> 24:10.656
The incident at One PP.

24:10.658 --> 24:12.925
Gee, I was kind of
enjoying Danny and Pop

24:12.927 --> 24:14.594
take shots at each other.

24:14.596 --> 24:15.861
I really hope you're
not gonna sit here

24:15.863 --> 24:17.897
and try to defend that
communist friend of yours.

24:17.899 --> 24:19.966
Not at this table.
Thank you very much.

24:19.968 --> 24:21.701
Okay, hold on a minute.

24:21.703 --> 24:23.002
Finish.

24:23.004 --> 24:24.870
No, I'm not defending her.

24:24.872 --> 24:26.038
She took a legitimate
complaint,

24:26.040 --> 24:29.041
but she voiced it
in the wrong way.

24:29.043 --> 24:31.243
HENRY: She defiled
the NYPD flag.

24:31.245 --> 24:32.945
How is that
a legitimate anything

24:32.947 --> 24:34.513
but a disgrace?
Exactly.

24:34.515 --> 24:36.282
Never mind.
- You brought it up.

24:36.284 --> 24:37.350
I take it back.

24:37.352 --> 24:38.517
ERIN:
Okay, permission

24:38.519 --> 24:39.552
to approach the bench.

24:39.554 --> 24:40.453
Permission denied.

24:40.455 --> 24:41.854
SEAN:
Is there any chance

24:41.856 --> 24:43.556
we could just, you know, eat?

24:43.558 --> 24:44.590
Yeah, this food
is delicious.

24:44.592 --> 24:46.058
It would be nice...
Not gonna happen.

24:46.060 --> 24:48.561
Let's just say for a second,
it was not the police flag.

24:48.563 --> 24:51.797
Let's say it was, um, a refugee

24:51.799 --> 24:55.001
and the flag from her native,
oppressive country.

24:55.003 --> 24:56.435
JAMIE:
Or a Gold Star mother

24:56.437 --> 24:57.670
and the flag
of that Baptist church

24:57.672 --> 24:59.772
that protests
outside military funerals?

24:59.774 --> 25:00.806
Churches have flags?

25:00.808 --> 25:02.141
The noisy ones do.

25:02.143 --> 25:03.209
There a point in there
somewhere?

25:03.211 --> 25:04.176
ERIN:
Yes, there is.

25:04.178 --> 25:06.512
And to quote
your favorite phrase,

25:06.514 --> 25:09.515
"You first need to walk
in the shoes of the other guy

25:09.517 --> 25:12.218
before you pass judgment on
an act of civil disobedience."

25:12.220 --> 25:13.986
DANNY: Okay, but
what did the NYPD

25:13.988 --> 25:17.490
ever do to that
snowflake friend of hers?

25:17.492 --> 25:18.891
To her, personally?

25:18.893 --> 25:20.526
Yes. To justify what she did,

25:20.528 --> 25:22.528
even in your fuzzy
point of view.

25:22.530 --> 25:24.563
Well, I don't...
(makes buzzer sound)

25:24.565 --> 25:25.297
Time's up.

25:25.299 --> 25:26.332
What're you gonna do

25:26.334 --> 25:27.266
next time you see her?

25:27.268 --> 25:28.567
Yeah, you gonna
compliment her?

25:28.569 --> 25:29.402
No.

25:29.404 --> 25:30.336
Walk on by.

25:30.338 --> 25:31.437
Set her straight.

25:31.439 --> 25:32.438
Ask her why.

25:32.440 --> 25:33.439
Or at least point out how she

25:33.441 --> 25:34.440
dissed you in the mix?

25:34.442 --> 25:37.043
Some of all of the above.

25:49.089 --> 25:52.391
Can parole officers really boss
parolees around like that?

25:52.393 --> 25:53.559
ERIN:
Pretty much.

25:53.561 --> 25:55.428
And the parolees
need to comply

25:55.430 --> 25:57.463
if they want to
see daylight again.

25:57.465 --> 25:59.532
So, they can be
searched at random,

25:59.534 --> 26:01.133
told who to associate with.

26:01.135 --> 26:02.968
Seems harsh.
Well, think about it

26:02.970 --> 26:04.437
from Vorhees' side.

26:04.439 --> 26:06.872
If he lets Gabe see Liza
and they get into a fight,

26:06.874 --> 26:10.042
somebody gets hurt or
is killed, it's on him.

26:10.044 --> 26:13.979
And if Voorhees is forcing Gabe
to commit crimes for him?

26:15.082 --> 26:16.549
Well, if you want to
take this on,

26:16.551 --> 26:17.783
you better have some ammo

26:17.785 --> 26:19.952
because the Department
of Corrections does not bow

26:19.954 --> 26:22.588
to the NYPD and nor should it.

26:22.590 --> 26:24.323
Well, if Voorhees
is doing this to Gabe,

26:24.325 --> 26:26.025
odds are he's doing it
to other parolees.

26:26.027 --> 26:28.194
And we call that conjecture.

26:28.196 --> 26:30.062
Uh, you have someone you
can trust in Corrections?

26:30.064 --> 26:33.165
Yeah, and he trusts me not
to hand out his digits.

26:33.167 --> 26:35.134
Look at it from my side.
If I suspect

26:35.136 --> 26:36.602
a parole officer
is abusing his power

26:36.604 --> 26:38.304
and I just let it slide,
what does that make me?

26:38.306 --> 26:39.472
Not going there.

26:39.474 --> 26:40.840
Or you, by extension?

26:40.842 --> 26:42.808
- Derelict of our duties, at least.
- No.

26:42.810 --> 26:44.677
- Text me the guy.
- No.

26:44.679 --> 26:46.312
- You're the best.
- Ja...

26:46.314 --> 26:47.713
(door closes)

26:52.686 --> 26:55.154
So, how was family dinner?

26:55.156 --> 26:56.388
Don't ask.
- Come on.

26:56.390 --> 26:58.157
Henry didn't give you
the cold shoulder?

26:58.159 --> 26:59.859
Was he too busy flinging rolls
at your head?

26:59.861 --> 27:01.627
You know, I'm the one
that should be mad at him.

27:01.629 --> 27:03.129
He just wanted to help.

27:03.131 --> 27:04.730
How? By criticizing
my every move,

27:04.732 --> 27:07.066
like my partner seems
to be doing lately?

27:07.068 --> 27:08.501
You just can't
see the obvious.

27:08.503 --> 27:10.603
Well, if it was obvious,
don't you think I'd see it?

27:10.605 --> 27:13.339
You and your grandfather
get under each other's skin

27:13.341 --> 27:14.807
because you're
exactly alike.

27:14.809 --> 27:16.208
Give me a break.

27:16.210 --> 27:18.577
You know, you've never been
more wrong in your life

27:18.579 --> 27:19.712
and that's saying something.

27:19.714 --> 27:21.147
I think it's cute.

27:21.149 --> 27:23.182
And I think I'm gonna need a new
partner if my current partner

27:23.184 --> 27:24.950
won't stop nagging me

27:24.952 --> 27:27.787
about my grandfather and start
helping me find Vangelis.

27:29.623 --> 27:31.390
Sounds like something
Henry would say.

27:31.392 --> 27:32.758
Get out of my way.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.994
(sighs)

27:34.996 --> 27:36.729
Yo, how long
were you in jail?

27:36.731 --> 27:39.098
12 hours. Totally worth it.

27:39.100 --> 27:41.367
Down with police brutality!

27:41.369 --> 27:44.203
Your live stream's been shared,
like, a million times.

27:46.072 --> 27:47.973
CHRISSIE: And the next thing
we do will have even more

27:47.975 --> 27:51.177
and more and-- I mean, that's
the way it has to be, right?

27:51.179 --> 27:52.545
I heard that.

27:53.847 --> 27:55.247
CHRISSIE (on video):
Antifa says no

27:55.249 --> 27:58.617
to the fascism of the NYPD!

27:58.619 --> 28:00.653
I'll see you guys later.

28:01.855 --> 28:02.955
Hey.

28:02.957 --> 28:04.023
Hey.

28:04.025 --> 28:05.224
Sorry.

28:05.226 --> 28:06.358
No biggie.

28:06.360 --> 28:07.660
You must've
taken some flack.

28:07.662 --> 28:09.195
Yeah, I did.

28:09.197 --> 28:12.231
And I wouldn't have minded,
if you let me in on your plan.

28:12.233 --> 28:14.667
I couldn't.
You're on that side.

28:14.669 --> 28:17.236
(scoffs) Now I'm
really insulted.

28:17.238 --> 28:19.405
What's your
family's business?

28:19.407 --> 28:21.874
(scoffs)
Carpets and flooring.

28:21.876 --> 28:26.212
So, you're all about
carpets and flooring?

28:28.048 --> 28:30.115
You mean, you want in?

28:30.117 --> 28:32.251
I mean I want respect.

28:33.553 --> 28:35.120
That I'm my own person.

28:35.122 --> 28:36.655
You have it.

28:38.491 --> 28:40.626
Do you want in?

28:46.833 --> 28:49.602
Tell me what's going on.

28:52.138 --> 28:53.606
A guy at DOC tipped you?

28:53.608 --> 28:56.342
Senior parole officer told me
that a parolee, Leo Epps,

28:56.344 --> 28:59.078
came in and said that
Voorhees made him do bad stuff.

28:59.080 --> 29:01.614
Was there an investigation?

29:01.616 --> 29:05.150
Uh, no, uh, Voorhees came
walking in, Leo clammed up,

29:05.152 --> 29:07.486
said he made a wrong turn
looking for the john.

29:11.725 --> 29:13.626
Yeah?
- Leo Epps?

29:13.628 --> 29:16.762
He's my son. He's not here.
Know when he'll be back?

29:16.764 --> 29:18.964
No, sorry.
- Hey, hold up.

29:18.966 --> 29:20.266
Hold-hold on a second.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:20.268 --> 29:22.468
Just want to talk to you.
Did that prick send you?

29:22.470 --> 29:24.737
Hey. Take it easy.
Am I being rousted now?

29:24.739 --> 29:27.773
And by prick, I'm assuming
you mean Leo's parole officer.

29:27.775 --> 29:31.343
Barged in here about
an hour ago, knocked Leo down,

29:31.345 --> 29:33.279
jammed a knee in his back,

29:33.281 --> 29:34.914
told me to wait
in the other room.

29:34.916 --> 29:37.516
What did Voorhees want?
He said Leo's latest drug test

29:37.518 --> 29:38.984
came back positive for weed.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.052
Does your son smoke?

29:40.054 --> 29:42.688
Honestly, yeah.

29:42.690 --> 29:43.622
But Voorhees said he used

29:43.624 --> 29:46.792
Leo's sample
on some other lowlife.

29:46.794 --> 29:49.561
Still, he was gonna bust my boy
if he didn't go

29:49.563 --> 29:51.630
into Rikers voluntarily.

29:51.632 --> 29:55.467
Said Leo had some, uh,
job to do in there.

29:55.469 --> 29:56.769
(exhales)

29:56.771 --> 30:00.039
And you didn't learn
any of this from me.

30:09.149 --> 30:12.117
Vangelis Properties
transferred 250K

30:12.119 --> 30:13.953
to Jerry Simmons' firm
two months ago.

30:13.955 --> 30:15.788
Uh-huh.
- A week later,

30:15.790 --> 30:18.257
Jerry's firm wired it
to an offshore account

30:18.259 --> 30:21.727
in the Isle of Man, adding to
the 200 grand already there.

30:21.729 --> 30:25.230
So, Simmons ripped off Vangelis.
Great, now we have motive.

30:25.232 --> 30:27.700
But nothing that proves
Vangelis forced The Streeber

30:27.702 --> 30:29.868
to kill Jerry and then
staged a suicide.

30:29.870 --> 30:32.404
So we got nothing.

30:32.406 --> 30:34.206
Next time I get a hunch,

30:34.208 --> 30:36.742
use your intuition
and don't listen to me.

30:38.578 --> 30:41.113
Do you remember
what Gormley used to say

30:41.115 --> 30:42.448
when he was our boss?

30:42.450 --> 30:43.849
Yeah, he used to say,

30:43.851 --> 30:46.385
"That wasn't a fart,
my chair's just squeaky."

30:46.387 --> 30:48.954
"If you hit a wall,
climb over it.

30:48.956 --> 30:50.990
If you can't climb over it..."

30:50.992 --> 30:53.425
"Go back to your first witness
and start over."

30:54.894 --> 30:56.462
Oh, no.

30:56.464 --> 30:58.998
No, we are not
going back to him.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.499
Yes.

31:00.501 --> 31:02.334
My grandfather told us
everything he knew.

31:02.336 --> 31:05.804
Or, everything
he thought he knew.

31:05.806 --> 31:08.774
(sighs)

31:09.442 --> 31:11.477
(slaps desk)

31:11.479 --> 31:13.479
(sighs)

31:15.382 --> 31:17.549
If you want it.

31:17.551 --> 31:20.819
Only if you want
to give it to me.

31:20.821 --> 31:22.554
I feel like I owe you.

31:22.556 --> 31:25.924
Nicky, you could never owe me
anything but respect.

31:25.926 --> 31:28.093
And only then,
if I've earned it.

31:28.095 --> 31:31.230
Why do you always have
to make things so complicated?

31:31.232 --> 31:35.401
I don't make them complicated,
they just usually are.

31:35.403 --> 31:37.369
(scoffs)

31:37.371 --> 31:40.506
There's another
disruption planned.

31:43.576 --> 31:46.345
Against the NYPD?

31:46.347 --> 31:50.282
No, not directly, but
anticipating their presence.

31:52.819 --> 31:56.021
That statue of a bull,
down by Wall Street.

31:56.023 --> 31:57.523
Yeah?

31:57.525 --> 31:58.891
To cover it in red paint.

31:58.893 --> 32:00.092
There a date and time?

32:00.094 --> 32:01.693
Tomorrow, lunchtime.

32:01.695 --> 32:06.065
For maximum effect,
with smoke bombs.

32:06.067 --> 32:08.067
Just smoke?

32:08.069 --> 32:11.003
And a million ball bearings
to scatter

32:11.005 --> 32:12.704
to trip up the police.

32:14.541 --> 32:16.008
And their horses.

32:16.010 --> 32:18.210
For the mounted units.

32:18.212 --> 32:19.511
(sighs)

32:19.513 --> 32:21.246
I didn't even think of that.

32:21.248 --> 32:23.415
That's my job.

32:23.417 --> 32:25.284
I'm sorry.

32:25.286 --> 32:26.351
For what?

32:26.353 --> 32:28.654
For getting us involved
with all of this.

32:28.656 --> 32:30.222
That's not on you.

32:30.224 --> 32:32.357
I'm going to have to talk
to some people now,

32:32.359 --> 32:34.193
if you'll excuse me.

32:38.631 --> 32:41.266
- (door opens)
- (sighs)

32:57.422 --> 32:59.156
Gramps.

32:59.158 --> 33:00.657
Daniel.

33:00.659 --> 33:05.095
Look, I, uh, just wanted to
come by and tell you I'm sorry.

33:05.097 --> 33:06.363
What for? I'm the meddler.

33:06.365 --> 33:07.497
No, you're not.

33:07.499 --> 33:09.666
Oh, yeah. I got it
from a very trusted source.

33:09.668 --> 33:12.335
Look, I admit,

33:12.337 --> 33:16.306
I might have flown off
the handle a little bit.

33:16.308 --> 33:17.774
Guess I got nervous having
the former commissioner

33:17.776 --> 33:19.643
looking over my shoulder.

33:19.645 --> 33:21.144
Not what I was trying to do.

33:21.146 --> 33:22.212
I know it wasn't,

33:22.214 --> 33:23.914
but that's what it felt like,

33:23.916 --> 33:25.949
and it felt like that
even more so

33:25.951 --> 33:27.551
because every time
you <i>were</i> looking,

33:27.553 --> 33:28.585
I was screwing up the case.

33:28.587 --> 33:29.920
Not that I saw.

33:29.922 --> 33:31.121
Really?

33:31.123 --> 33:32.689
Danny.

33:32.691 --> 33:34.825
All cases are tough
until they break.

33:34.827 --> 33:36.359
That's the fun of it.

33:36.361 --> 33:37.761
And what more fun,

33:37.763 --> 33:38.962
but doing it alongside you?

33:38.964 --> 33:42.632
Wish all my witnesses had
your eyes and ears.

33:42.634 --> 33:44.534
I mean, you could clean
this whole city up

33:44.536 --> 33:45.802
in the blink of an eye.

33:45.804 --> 33:48.038
Put the whole family racket
out of business.

33:48.040 --> 33:49.673
Well, I don't accept
your apology.

33:49.675 --> 33:51.174
You don't?

33:51.176 --> 33:54.177
No, not till
you accept mine.

33:54.179 --> 33:56.046
'Cause, I, uh...

33:56.048 --> 33:58.548
I barged in without being asked,

33:58.550 --> 34:01.585
and stuck my nose
where it didn't belong.

34:01.587 --> 34:04.921
Okay. Well, apology accepted.

34:05.957 --> 34:07.724
So you think maybe
we could start over?

34:07.726 --> 34:09.659
'Cause I really could
use your help.

34:09.661 --> 34:10.659
Shoot.

34:10.661 --> 34:12.027
Is there anything

34:12.030 --> 34:14.563
that you didn't tell me
about the crash?

34:14.565 --> 34:19.335
Anything you might have
forgotten or overlooked

34:19.338 --> 34:20.370
or slipped your mind?

34:20.371 --> 34:22.539
Even the most
insignificant detail?

34:22.541 --> 34:24.306
No.

34:24.309 --> 34:26.076
All right.

34:26.078 --> 34:27.543
But Whitney did

34:27.545 --> 34:29.478
say something to me
at your squad.

34:29.481 --> 34:30.947
After I told her

34:30.949 --> 34:33.350
that she shouldn't worry because
my grandson was on the case...

34:33.351 --> 34:34.317
Mm-hmm.

34:34.319 --> 34:35.784
...she looked
at me and said,

34:35.786 --> 34:38.021
"Ooh, someone will pay."

34:38.023 --> 34:40.623
Like she knew
who killed her husband?

34:40.626 --> 34:45.495
Or, as if she was planning
to get justice herself.

34:47.465 --> 34:49.466
The wife.

34:49.467 --> 34:51.067
Okay, thanks.

34:51.069 --> 34:55.138
Um, I'm gonna go deal with her
down at the squad.

34:55.139 --> 34:57.173
You want to tag along?

34:57.175 --> 35:00.677
What, and skip the best
meatloaf sandwich in the world?

35:00.679 --> 35:02.913
Nah. You go ahead.

35:05.349 --> 35:07.484
You still got it, Gramps.

35:07.486 --> 35:11.054
Hmm. I do, don't I?

35:14.058 --> 35:16.126
Voorhees.
Glad you could come.

35:16.128 --> 35:18.094
What's going on? Some sort
of emergency, you said,

35:18.096 --> 35:19.195
with Gabe Harris?

35:19.197 --> 35:21.932
Actually, it's more
your emergency.

35:25.336 --> 35:27.404
What are they doing
out of Rikers?

35:27.406 --> 35:28.572
We brought them here.

35:28.574 --> 35:30.640
You c-can't transfer my people!

35:30.642 --> 35:32.809
They're not your people.
Not after Gabe tells

35:32.811 --> 35:35.779
the DOC area supervisor that
his P.O. made him break the law

35:35.781 --> 35:37.047
for his own ends.

35:37.049 --> 35:38.381
You know, Leo's got
quite the tale

35:38.383 --> 35:39.783
of being ordered into Rikers

35:39.785 --> 35:41.818
to shank a fellow parolee.

35:41.820 --> 35:43.386
I want them out of there now!

35:43.388 --> 35:44.521
Hey!
Hands behind your back.

35:44.523 --> 35:45.555
What are you doing?

35:45.557 --> 35:47.090
Ending your reign of terror.

35:47.092 --> 35:48.358
(shouts)
(handcuffs tighten)

35:48.360 --> 35:49.626
You can't arrest me.

35:49.628 --> 35:51.461
Sure can. And detain you

35:51.463 --> 35:53.563
until DOC OSI gets here.

35:53.565 --> 35:55.332
Go to hell. Both of you.

35:55.334 --> 35:56.800
Do me a favor, Janko.

35:56.802 --> 35:58.468
Put our fellow
law enforcement officer here

35:58.470 --> 35:59.836
into the detectives cell,
will you?

35:59.838 --> 36:01.204
Happily.

36:01.206 --> 36:04.207
You know, you're gonna get
your very own parole officer,

36:04.209 --> 36:07.644
and I hope he's just like you.

36:07.646 --> 36:10.113
JAMIE:
As soon as DOC

36:10.115 --> 36:11.314
starts their investigation,

36:11.316 --> 36:12.916
you guys will get assigned
a new P.O.

36:12.918 --> 36:15.585
You'll tell them I didn't
want to stab anybody, right?

36:15.587 --> 36:17.020
Yeah. And Gabe,

36:17.022 --> 36:19.155
I can't guarantee that
you're gonna get to see Liza,

36:19.157 --> 36:21.758
but I'll put in a good word.

36:23.194 --> 36:24.527
Officer Reagan.

36:26.397 --> 36:28.798
Uh, why'd you help out
me and Liza?

36:28.800 --> 36:30.567
You didn't have to do that.

36:30.569 --> 36:33.003
You love her, she loves you?

36:33.005 --> 36:33.789
Yeah.

36:33.790 --> 36:36.858
There's no law against that
I'm gonna enforce.

36:40.930 --> 36:43.131
(exhales)

36:59.448 --> 37:01.449
Going somewhere?

37:02.685 --> 37:04.185
What are you doing here?

37:04.187 --> 37:06.554
What am I doing here?

37:06.556 --> 37:08.990
Stopping you from doing
something really stupid.

37:08.992 --> 37:09.788
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:09.812 --> 37:11.460
Yes, you do.

37:11.461 --> 37:13.661
It was you who opened up
the offshore bank account.

37:13.663 --> 37:15.330
It was you
who wired money to it.

37:15.332 --> 37:17.398
And it was you
who had the stupid idea

37:17.400 --> 37:18.933
of trying to
rip off Vangelis.

37:18.935 --> 37:20.735
Not your husband.

37:20.737 --> 37:23.404
I was just trying to make
a better life for my family.

37:23.406 --> 37:24.806
Yep.

37:24.808 --> 37:27.408
And Jerry was too gutless to do
it, so I had to do it myself.

37:27.410 --> 37:30.078
Yeah, but ironically,
Vangelis thought it was Jerry,

37:30.080 --> 37:32.747
and now he's the one
who ended up dead.

37:32.749 --> 37:33.948
Not you.

37:33.950 --> 37:36.351
Which is why he has to die.

37:36.353 --> 37:40.088
No. You're not
a murderer, Whitney.

37:40.090 --> 37:41.422
But he is.

37:41.424 --> 37:42.891
So what you're gonna do
is tell me everything

37:42.893 --> 37:44.259
you know about Vangelis,

37:44.261 --> 37:46.794
and I'm gonna collar him
the right way.

37:48.864 --> 37:51.866
Please, just go, so I can
do what I came here to do.

37:51.868 --> 37:53.001
I'm gonna go.

37:53.003 --> 37:54.569
But you're coming with me.

37:54.571 --> 37:56.604
Let's go.

37:56.606 --> 37:58.773
Hey.

37:58.775 --> 38:01.543
Do you promise me
you're gonna make him pay?

38:01.545 --> 38:03.945
With a smile on my face.

38:07.383 --> 38:08.683
You ready?

38:14.790 --> 38:16.524
Whoa-ho-ho. Hey!

38:16.526 --> 38:18.259
Vangelis!

38:18.261 --> 38:20.895
Enjoy your freedom.

38:22.865 --> 38:25.033
While it lasts.

38:31.674 --> 38:33.141
So, Dad,

38:33.143 --> 38:35.910
why the sudden urge
to lose at poker?

38:35.912 --> 38:38.079
Gee, now I'm all psyched out.

38:40.849 --> 38:42.850
(bottle thuds)

38:42.852 --> 38:45.053
Thank you.

39:05.574 --> 39:07.775
She is 21.

39:15.851 --> 39:19.454
Well, we were there.

39:19.456 --> 39:21.489
Bad Intel or what?

39:21.491 --> 39:23.658
No, not exactly.

39:23.660 --> 39:24.692
Was what bad Intel?

39:24.694 --> 39:25.760
I'm listening.

39:25.762 --> 39:26.728
Grandpa, after I came

39:26.730 --> 39:28.129
to your office
the other day, I...

39:28.131 --> 39:29.697
Wait. When did you
go to his office?

39:29.699 --> 39:31.599
Oh, let her explain.

39:31.601 --> 39:33.167
Or try to.

39:33.169 --> 39:34.902
There is no "try" on this one.

39:34.904 --> 39:36.871
At least I know
why I got the invite.

39:36.873 --> 39:38.606
I went back
to Chrissie and her friends

39:38.608 --> 39:40.008
and told them to call it off.

39:40.010 --> 39:41.876
You told them to call it off?
Between

39:41.878 --> 39:43.211
the smoke bombs
and the possible injuries

39:43.213 --> 39:45.046
from the ball bearings,

39:45.048 --> 39:46.781
it was a terrible idea.
I couldn't say more,

39:46.783 --> 39:48.783
because then they would
know I told you,

39:48.785 --> 39:50.151
and I couldn't tell you

39:50.153 --> 39:51.653
because they may go
through with it anyhow...

39:51.655 --> 39:53.288
Well, that wouldn't guarantee
they wouldn't try it anyway.

39:53.290 --> 39:54.422
I know you mobilized
your forces.

39:54.424 --> 39:56.758
You know,
all this double-dealing

39:56.760 --> 40:00.261
really made me feel no better
than how she treated me.

40:02.298 --> 40:04.666
I'm sorry things got
so complicated.

40:04.668 --> 40:07.435
They just usually are.

40:09.772 --> 40:12.407
Shut up and deal.

40:15.778 --> 40:17.278
