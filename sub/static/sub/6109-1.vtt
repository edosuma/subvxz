00:19.896 --> 00:22.148
I'm glad you decided
to come, Maggie-Sue.

00:22.315 --> 00:24.734
The road's a lonely place.

00:24.901 --> 00:27.028
And the wife
isn't much of a traveller.

00:28.154 --> 00:29.989
The wife isn't a lot of things.

00:42.752 --> 00:44.796
Oh, it's nothing to be
afraid of.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.675
It's just a part of
plain ol' everyday lovemaking.

00:49.676 --> 00:52.929
I remember when the president
said it wasn't even sex, really,

00:53.096 --> 00:54.889
more like a form of greeting,
a...

00:55.932 --> 00:57.892
..show of affection
between friends.

01:01.020 --> 01:02.939
Sonofabitch! Jesus! Fuck!

01:11.614 --> 01:14.117
Oh, fuck, oh, fuck,
oh, fuck, oh, fuck.

01:17.579 --> 01:20.165
Shit. Shit!

01:22.417 --> 01:24.753
It's OK.
D...d...don't try and move.

01:24.919 --> 01:27.005
I'm going to call for help.

01:30.258 --> 01:32.218
Ugh!

02:16.513 --> 02:18.306
Our Father,
who does art in heaven,

02:18.473 --> 02:20.517
deliver me from evil, with
liberty and justice for all...

02:39.327 --> 02:42.205
The idea is that
like attracts like.

02:42.372 --> 02:44.123
That's why it's called
the law of attraction.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.751
Just focus on...
focus on positive things

02:46.918 --> 02:49.420
and you'll end up
with positive results.

02:49.587 --> 02:53.258
Focus on the negative and you'll
end up with more of the same.

02:53.424 --> 02:58.012
My recent illness, for instance,
or this shithole I'm living in,

02:58.179 --> 03:01.015
direct manifestation
of negative thought.

03:01.182 --> 03:04.060
Thankfully, I've put
that awful disease behind me.

03:04.227 --> 03:08.189
Soon, this dreary dump
will be a thing of the past.

03:08.356 --> 03:11.442
But I am grateful for all of it.

03:11.609 --> 03:13.236
Wake-up calls, really,

03:13.403 --> 03:16.823
to get me to change
my doom-and-gloom outlook

03:16.990 --> 03:20.827
and step into the light
of my own joyous prosperity.

03:20.994 --> 03:23.496
That's the promise
I make myself.

03:37.260 --> 03:41.139
You of all people know I live up
to the promises I make.

03:54.903 --> 03:58.239
I want to thank you, Michael.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.033
Without your encouragement,

04:00.199 --> 04:02.076
Norman might never have shown
his true colours.

04:03.953 --> 04:08.958
A whining, pathetic man.
Angry and empty...

04:09.125 --> 04:13.963
Still, I drew his negativity
to me, I suppose.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.382
Law of attraction.
You see how it works, Michael?

04:17.550 --> 04:19.177
You willed bad things for me,

04:19.344 --> 04:22.055
but you only brought on
bad things for yourself.

04:23.681 --> 04:26.684
Just like that
little sister of yours.

04:26.851 --> 04:31.689
Oh, I have a house guest coming,
so it's time for you to go now.

04:32.690 --> 04:35.318
Bon voyage, as they say.

07:11.349 --> 07:14.560
Must've hurt like a motherfucker.

07:14.727 --> 07:16.521
For a second I thought
you really were dead.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.773
You have to commit
if you want to sell it.

07:18.940 --> 07:20.775
You've got some giant balls
taking a hit like that.

07:20.942 --> 07:23.986
The Rumanceks are world-renowned
for their testicular girth.

07:29.575 --> 07:31.202
A thousand thankyous
for what you did.

07:31.369 --> 07:33.287
Yeah, well, you saved my life.

07:34.455 --> 07:37.625
Anyways, it was great being out
with you guys - full moon.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.418
It felt good.

07:39.585 --> 07:41.212
- As well it should.
- Alright, cheers, boys.

07:43.131 --> 07:45.591
- These are your people.
You're one of us. -Cheers.

07:45.758 --> 07:47.343
Seeing as how this worked out
so well,

07:47.510 --> 07:49.095
I've got something else
in the pipeline that...

07:49.262 --> 07:51.055
No. I can't.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.688
Miranda and Nadia
are still out there.

07:59.689 --> 08:02.817
Understood. Don't mean to push.
I totally get it.

08:05.903 --> 08:08.281
You're sure that no cops
are gonna look for this truck?

08:08.447 --> 08:10.908
Not in a million years.

08:12.076 --> 08:14.912
That is the beauty
of thieving from thieves.

08:16.539 --> 08:20.835
50 crates
at 200 pounds per.

08:21.002 --> 08:23.296
Flip it cheap to move it fast.

08:23.462 --> 08:26.215
So, conservatively,

08:26.382 --> 08:29.510
we're looking at right around

08:29.677 --> 08:31.888
1.2 million and change.

08:32.054 --> 08:35.183
You fellas did good.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.434
Well, he was the brains
behind the whole thing.

08:37.602 --> 08:39.395
But you, Peter,
were a rock star.

08:39.562 --> 08:42.273
I'll store it here
while you work a deal.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.066
You're reaching out
to our regular buyers?

08:44.232 --> 08:45.943
I've got it handled.

08:50.406 --> 08:53.201
- Did you see her?
- Briefly.

08:54.535 --> 08:57.705
I try to talk to her
as often as I can, but...

08:59.415 --> 09:01.042
..she moves around so much.

09:01.209 --> 09:03.211
Sometimes I think
things are harder for her

09:03.377 --> 09:05.213
over in the old country
than she lets on.

09:06.464 --> 09:09.342
- How did she look?
- Peter, listen to me.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.135
Your mother is well.

09:11.302 --> 09:14.513
She misses you,
but she's surrounded by family -

09:14.680 --> 09:16.307
people who love her too.

09:16.474 --> 09:19.769
She told me to give you this.
Said you were expecting it.

09:19.936 --> 09:21.395
Mmm.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.608
This belonged to my grandmother.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.862
Thank you. I know you went to
a lot of trouble.

09:30.029 --> 09:33.950
Trouble
is what our people live for.

09:38.371 --> 09:40.248
You...you OK, bro?

09:40.414 --> 09:42.208
Yeah.

09:47.964 --> 09:49.715
Lynda approves.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.635
And so do I.

09:54.095 --> 09:56.347
Now you have permission
to ask my cousin to marry you.

09:58.099 --> 10:00.017
OK.

10:07.108 --> 10:08.776
I will make her a queen.

10:08.943 --> 10:12.029
You better treat her right
or I'll fucking kill you.

10:13.030 --> 10:15.032
- Welcome to the family.
- Oh.

10:30.006 --> 10:31.924
I'm getting...

10:33.342 --> 10:35.136
..absolutely nothing.

10:38.222 --> 10:40.099
All we can do is keep trying.

10:41.309 --> 10:43.686
I had a case
out in LA once.

10:43.853 --> 10:46.147
Wife went missing,
suspected homicide,

10:46.314 --> 10:48.357
and the family brought in
a clairvoyant.

10:49.358 --> 10:53.404
Never did find the woman, but,
man, I tell you that psychic -

10:53.571 --> 10:55.573
mad skills
locating the client's wallet.

10:55.740 --> 10:57.742
Mm-hm.

10:59.827 --> 11:03.205
I have a special gift
for divining assholes.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.751
Far be it for me
to cast aspersions,

11:06.917 --> 11:09.462
but when you're trafficking
in the realm of the unseen,

11:09.628 --> 11:11.297
there are those who might want
to take advantage -

11:11.464 --> 11:13.966
grifters and so forth.

11:15.009 --> 11:17.178
Present company excepted,
of course.

11:20.014 --> 11:23.059
- I gotta go.
- Alright. Thanks, Dee.

11:23.225 --> 11:24.727
Mm-hm.

11:27.646 --> 11:31.609
OK, smart guy, what do you got?

11:31.776 --> 11:33.527
Transcripts of my interviews

11:33.694 --> 11:36.739
with every patient
in Spivak's practice.

11:36.906 --> 11:39.075
Unremarkable for
anything out of the ordinary.

11:39.241 --> 11:42.286
Travelled the world a little bit
doing pro bono medical stuff.

11:42.453 --> 11:44.372
Was not banging his nurse.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.582
A better man than I am.
Real dime piece.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.376
What else?

11:48.542 --> 11:50.711
Spivak got his medical degree
at Leipzig University

11:50.878 --> 11:53.297
in Germany, studied immunology
at the University of Maine...

11:53.464 --> 11:55.091
- He's German?
- Beats me.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.426
I traced him as far back
as med school. Dead-ends there.

11:57.593 --> 12:00.888
- What about Miranda's family?
- Father is deceased.

12:01.055 --> 12:02.890
Tracked down the mother
in Provo, Utah.

12:03.057 --> 12:04.975
Hadn't spoken to her daughter
in 10 years.

12:05.142 --> 12:06.769
Contacted every morgue
and hospital

12:06.936 --> 12:08.562
up and down the east coast.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.565
No Jane Does matching the
description. Same with the baby.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.234
Basically, you show up
empty-handed

12:13.401 --> 12:14.652
expecting to get paid.

12:14.819 --> 12:18.114
I put in the hours, I get paid.
That's how it works.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.908
Sounds like a grift to me.

12:21.075 --> 12:23.035
Hmm.

12:23.202 --> 12:26.455
You care so much about these
folks, gotta ask, why me?

12:26.622 --> 12:28.416
Why not go to the police?

12:29.708 --> 12:32.294
Police get involved,
things get public.

12:32.461 --> 12:35.589
And you're looking to be
discreet. I understand.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.383
But this baby you got me
searching for,

12:37.550 --> 12:39.218
there's no birth certificate.

12:39.385 --> 12:41.554
Technically speaking,
it hasn't been born.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.931
People hire me to find shit out,
mostly where's the money,

12:44.098 --> 12:45.724
who's fucking who, so forth.

12:45.891 --> 12:48.477
What is it that you're not
telling me about this kid?

12:48.644 --> 12:50.271
This girl?

12:50.438 --> 12:53.357
I gotta know.
Otherwise I can't do my job.

12:55.067 --> 12:58.654
This is
all the information you need.

13:01.699 --> 13:04.243
Keep digging on Spivak.
I expect results.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.508
Dr Pryce.

13:21.427 --> 13:24.013
- There's an anomaly.
- Anomaly tells me nothing.

13:24.180 --> 13:25.806
But it would be an anomaly,
I suppose,

13:25.973 --> 13:27.808
if you actually communicated
meaningful information.

13:27.975 --> 13:31.020
The specimen is experiencing
an excessive amount

13:31.187 --> 13:33.189
of chromosomal deletion,
which is causing it to...

13:33.355 --> 13:36.525
I know what it causes.
Did you try the...the...

13:37.860 --> 13:40.404
Blinsky, you know what I asked
you to do, the amniotic...

13:40.571 --> 13:42.198
..the...the...the thing,
you know.

13:42.364 --> 13:44.867
It had no effect.

13:45.034 --> 13:46.660
Did you get any sleep
last night?

13:46.827 --> 13:49.079
That's no concern of yours.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.915
How did this happen?

13:51.081 --> 13:54.835
I suspended the safety
protocols, as you asked,

13:55.002 --> 13:56.629
but the amount of growth hormone
required...

13:56.795 --> 14:01.091
Creeping mother of Jesus!
What are you trying to say?

14:02.092 --> 14:04.428
We should dispose of
the specimen and start over.

14:04.595 --> 14:07.306
Give up, in other words.

14:07.473 --> 14:09.808
I promoted you because I thought
you were a problem solver

14:09.975 --> 14:11.644
and it turns out
you're just a gutless quitter.

14:11.810 --> 14:14.146
- Dr Pryce...
- What?!

14:14.313 --> 14:16.315
..your meeting started
20 minutes ago.

14:16.482 --> 14:18.901
My meeting? Wh...what meeting?

14:19.068 --> 14:21.529
The one I reminded you about
an hour ago.

14:23.322 --> 14:26.700
Right. Fix it.

14:30.246 --> 14:32.831
We need to make this jury
understand

14:32.998 --> 14:35.042
that there's absolutely
no correlation

14:35.209 --> 14:36.835
between our product

14:37.002 --> 14:40.381
and the deaths caused by liver
failure their lawsuit alleges.

14:40.548 --> 14:42.675
Apologies. Urgent matter.

14:43.842 --> 14:45.344
Continue.

14:46.345 --> 14:49.682
To do that, we need to take
a long, hard look

14:49.848 --> 14:52.309
at who these so-called
victims actually are.

14:52.476 --> 14:54.311
You look like shit.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.146
You've inherited
your mother's charm.

14:56.313 --> 14:57.940
Fuck you.
What have you found out?

14:58.107 --> 15:00.776
- We're in the process. -I assume
that's code for nothing.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.570
You promised me
you'd have answers.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.155
And I will. It just takes
a little patience.

15:05.322 --> 15:07.283
Gentlemen,

15:07.449 --> 15:10.869
if there's anything
that you don't understand,

15:11.036 --> 15:12.788
perhaps you've missed,
I can help you through...

15:12.955 --> 15:15.082
Spare me the hand job, Gans.

15:15.249 --> 15:17.209
This poor people's march
will save the company 100 mil,

15:17.376 --> 15:19.211
well and good, but I...

15:21.880 --> 15:23.716
I...

15:26.093 --> 15:28.137
That is to say, I...

15:28.304 --> 15:29.930
Get out.

15:30.097 --> 15:33.392
I said, "Get out."
Go. Leave us alone.

15:42.526 --> 15:45.446
You really need to dial back on
the caffeine there, buddy boy.

15:45.613 --> 15:47.239
I'm nearly done
mapping the genome

15:47.406 --> 15:49.116
from the skin sample we found
in Spivak's office.

15:49.283 --> 15:51.368
How long does it take?
It's been six weeks.

15:51.535 --> 15:54.121
- I thought you were a fucking genius.
- I am a fucking genius.

15:54.288 --> 15:55.956
It took 13 years to map
the human genome.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.375
- And I'm getting close...
- I want my kid back.

16:00.294 --> 16:02.796
- Roman, I'm trying to help you.
- I know.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.636
I'm almost out of nutrient.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.889
There'll be a new batch ready
this afternoon.

16:12.056 --> 16:13.682
I have to get your sister ready.

16:13.849 --> 16:16.977
I swear, if this fucking hearing
goes sideways, I'm gonna...

16:19.188 --> 16:20.981
We have to let this play out.

16:28.656 --> 16:30.491
I hate lorazepam.

16:30.658 --> 16:35.037
Makes me feel like my brain's
made out of chewing gum.

16:35.204 --> 16:37.456
It will help you relax.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.256
There we go.

16:47.341 --> 16:49.134
Big day today.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.930
It's really been six weeks?

16:53.097 --> 16:54.807
That's the nature
of psychotic departures.

16:54.973 --> 16:57.184
You were overwhelmed
by traumatic events,

16:57.351 --> 16:59.186
your mind disconnected.

17:00.479 --> 17:02.314
I was afraid
you wouldn't come back.

17:03.524 --> 17:06.484
The last thing I remember
was Prycilla.

17:08.319 --> 17:11.156
So much blood.

17:12.741 --> 17:16.537
When that picture comes
in your mind, turn the channel

17:16.704 --> 17:19.248
until you find
something far less painful.

17:20.374 --> 17:22.334
The meds will help you do that.

17:23.377 --> 17:25.421
What did you do with her body?

17:25.587 --> 17:28.424
Shelley, it's better
if you don't...

17:28.590 --> 17:30.426
Tell me.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.388
She was laid to rest.

17:34.555 --> 17:37.182
Under a beautiful oak
overlooking the river.

17:37.349 --> 17:39.518
My reading tree.

17:44.273 --> 17:47.443
Do I have to go back
to live with her?

17:48.694 --> 17:51.989
Roman is doing his best
to see that that doesn't happen.

17:54.032 --> 17:56.076
Can't I just stay here?

17:56.243 --> 17:57.870
Nothing would make me happier,

17:58.036 --> 17:59.872
but the courts
would never allow it.

18:00.038 --> 18:02.541
- I'm afraid, Uncle Johann.
- No. Don't be.

18:03.834 --> 18:07.129
Your brother and I will be
with you every step of the way,

18:07.296 --> 18:09.423
whatever happens.

18:09.590 --> 18:13.260
And these will help you
keep those fears in check.

18:16.764 --> 18:18.390
It's my understanding

18:18.557 --> 18:20.225
that due to the lack
of credible evidence,

18:20.392 --> 18:22.853
the people wish to drop
all charges against Ms Godfrey?

18:23.020 --> 18:26.190
- We do, Your Honour.
- So ordered.

18:27.232 --> 18:30.319
And as to the challenge
of guardianship

18:30.486 --> 18:32.404
filed by Roman Godfrey,

18:32.571 --> 18:35.324
the court has found it
without merit.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.077
Young lady, would you
approach the bench, please?

18:45.375 --> 18:48.045
Ms Godfrey, I'm releasing you
into your mother's care.

18:51.673 --> 18:53.509
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

18:54.802 --> 18:56.428
Yes, ma'am.

18:56.595 --> 18:59.765
I should warn you that
even a legal finding of fact

18:59.932 --> 19:01.642
won't make your troubles
disappear.

19:01.809 --> 19:04.019
And due to the notoriety
of this case,

19:04.186 --> 19:06.605
there may be individuals
who harbour anger towards you.

19:06.772 --> 19:09.942
However misguided, it is real
and potentially dangerous.

19:10.108 --> 19:13.445
I wish you the best of luck.
You're free to go.

19:13.612 --> 19:17.699
- Thank you. Come on, sweety.
- We need to talk. Now.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.207
Don't think I don't know
what your act is all about.

19:25.374 --> 19:27.626
You can't wait to get
your hands on her trust fund.

19:27.793 --> 19:29.628
Oh, Roman, this negativity,
it's not good for your health...

19:29.795 --> 19:31.630
How long do you think
she's gonna stay with you

19:31.797 --> 19:33.423
when she finds out
you murdered Norman, huh?

19:33.590 --> 19:35.259
I have no idea
what you're talking about...

19:35.425 --> 19:38.220
- Fuck you!
- Roman, calm down.

19:38.387 --> 19:40.013
Your sister's mental state
is extremely fragile.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.474
Any trauma could induce
a severe conversion reaction.

19:42.641 --> 19:44.309
What does that even mean?

19:44.476 --> 19:47.354
If she goes over the edge again,
we may never get her back.

19:55.112 --> 19:57.322
I missed you so much.

20:01.994 --> 20:04.496
You know I love you, right?

20:04.663 --> 20:07.749
She's not your jailer
and this isn't forever.

20:09.084 --> 20:12.713
I'm only a phone call away.
I'll make this right, I promise.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.673
Let's go home.

20:59.885 --> 21:01.678
Animal!

21:04.598 --> 21:06.433
Pay no attention.

21:13.273 --> 21:16.526
Do we come clean and tell
this Sherlock homeboy what's up?

21:16.693 --> 21:19.446
You mean, that our missing baby
with telekinetic powers

21:19.613 --> 21:22.574
was taken by a flying reptoid
with a 30-foot wingspan

21:22.741 --> 21:24.701
who had been masquerading around
town as the family doctor?

21:24.868 --> 21:26.703
Or do we start slow
and whisper in his ear

21:26.870 --> 21:28.538
that he's been living in a world

21:28.705 --> 21:31.541
of upirs and vargulfs the whole
time and he didn't even know it?

21:31.708 --> 21:33.335
Oh, but I'd leave out
the spontaneous freak lactation.

21:33.502 --> 21:35.128
That's too unbelievable.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.965
Even if we're just spinning
our wheels with this guy,

21:38.131 --> 21:39.925
we can't just not do anything.

21:44.388 --> 21:47.599
What if we never find them?
What if they're dead?

21:47.766 --> 21:50.978
Don't go there.
We can't think like that.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.939
I'm sorry.

21:54.106 --> 21:55.774
Tell me some good news.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.445
Destiny and Andreas
are getting hitched.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.784
- Shit.
- Shit.

22:05.951 --> 22:07.744
Feels right.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.791
Do you mind if I crash
at your place for a while?

22:12.958 --> 22:16.169
- Give the lovebirds some space?
- Mi casa and shit.

22:39.151 --> 22:40.777
Don't wait around for me.

23:00.255 --> 23:02.049
Hey.

23:57.270 --> 24:01.608
It's not Versailles,
but it's clean...relatively.

24:01.775 --> 24:03.401
And it's temporary.

24:03.568 --> 24:05.487
We need to get you
one of those pill organisers

24:05.654 --> 24:07.280
with the days of the week on it.

24:07.447 --> 24:11.910
It doesn't matter where we stay.
It's just a place to sleep.

24:13.036 --> 24:14.955
Oh, that's very understanding
of you, dear,

24:15.122 --> 24:17.499
but once we get our finances
sorted out,

24:17.666 --> 24:19.918
we'll find the perfect spot
where we can be comfortable,

24:20.085 --> 24:21.878
just like before.

24:23.255 --> 24:26.216
And this one
is to help you sleep.

24:26.383 --> 24:28.009
Makes me dizzy.

24:28.176 --> 24:30.804
Oh, you can't be dizzy
when you're asleep.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.810
I have a surprise for you.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.651
I don't like dresses.

24:44.818 --> 24:46.611
They're just not me.

24:47.904 --> 24:49.531
Don't be silly.

24:49.698 --> 24:51.533
I mean, you used to wear them
all the time.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.493
You'd look so pretty in this.

24:57.664 --> 25:00.083
Why do you hate Roman?

25:03.336 --> 25:06.214
I don't hate anyone, dear,

25:06.381 --> 25:08.383
certainly not your brother.

25:13.597 --> 25:16.516
It's just that
he is a very angry young man

25:16.683 --> 25:18.768
who goes around
blaming everyone else

25:18.935 --> 25:21.271
for the unhappiness in his life.

25:21.438 --> 25:23.231
He blames me especially.

25:24.441 --> 25:26.067
The life he's building
for himself

25:26.234 --> 25:28.820
has made him miserable
and alone.

25:28.987 --> 25:31.072
And I will not allow him
to poison you.

25:31.239 --> 25:34.284
You don't understand him
like I do.

25:34.451 --> 25:37.495
Oh, Shelley, dear,

25:37.662 --> 25:40.790
you are such a good
and pure person

25:40.957 --> 25:42.876
not to think badly of him,

25:43.043 --> 25:47.464
but I will do everything in my power
to protect you from him.

25:48.798 --> 25:53.178
It's just us girls now,
so we need to look out for each other.

25:57.474 --> 26:00.143
There's nothing to worry about,
darling.

26:00.310 --> 26:02.103
Mother's here.

26:43.103 --> 26:47.774
Now, release the abs
and let them flow like water.

26:47.941 --> 26:51.611
And now we're going to sway
from side to side.

26:51.778 --> 26:55.657
And side to side, side to side.

26:55.824 --> 27:00.620
Yeah, that's it.
Side to side, side to side.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.414
Side...

27:02.580 --> 27:05.458
What are you doing here?

27:05.625 --> 27:09.087
"A moment of happiness,
you and I..."

27:09.254 --> 27:11.589
"..sitting on the veranda.

27:12.882 --> 27:14.467
"Apparently two,
but one in soul.

27:14.634 --> 27:18.471
"We feel the flowing water
of life here, you and I.

27:18.638 --> 27:22.892
"With the garden's beauty
and the birds singing.

27:24.269 --> 27:26.980
"The stars will be watching us,
and we will show them

27:27.147 --> 27:30.150
"what it is to be
a thin crescent moon.

27:32.861 --> 27:36.906
"You and I unselfed
will be together,

27:37.073 --> 27:39.075
"indifferent
to idle speculation.

27:39.242 --> 27:43.997
- "You and I..."
- What are you doing?

27:44.998 --> 27:48.626
"..in one form upon this earth

27:48.793 --> 27:54.382
"and in another form
in a timeless, sweet land."

28:02.307 --> 28:05.060
Destiny Rumancek...

28:08.355 --> 28:10.148
..will you be my wife?

28:12.025 --> 28:15.945
Yes.

28:16.112 --> 28:18.031
Yes!

28:30.710 --> 28:32.337
Hello, Johann.

28:34.130 --> 28:37.717
- How did you get in here?
- Have you lost a little weight?

28:37.884 --> 28:40.136
I'm calling security.

28:40.303 --> 28:43.473
Are you OK?
You don't look at all well.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.266
Trevor.

28:45.433 --> 28:47.060
I'll have you turned over
to the police,

28:47.227 --> 28:49.604
- prosecuted for trespassing.
- Oh, stop being so petty.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.439
You destroyed my life's work.

28:51.606 --> 28:54.025
Nearly killed Shelley
in the process. Trevor!

28:54.192 --> 28:56.111
I was very angry with you,

28:56.277 --> 28:58.780
but I would like us to find
a way to move past that.

28:58.947 --> 29:02.492
- You are the most shameless...
- Doctor, there are agents.

29:02.659 --> 29:04.744
Where have you been? There's
an intruder in my office.

29:05.745 --> 29:08.915
- They have a warrant. -What in
Christ are you yammering about?!

29:09.082 --> 29:11.709
Federal agents are downstairs
with a search warrant.

29:12.710 --> 29:15.088
I told them everything, Johann.

29:16.631 --> 29:19.467
No. No.

29:19.634 --> 29:22.095
No, no, no...

29:23.096 --> 29:27.183
Carthago delenda est.
Real world. This is not a drill.

29:27.350 --> 29:28.977
Download all files.

29:29.144 --> 29:30.895
Those coded 'Gatekeeper 47'
load to external drives,

29:31.062 --> 29:32.522
then wipe the system.

29:50.457 --> 29:52.250
I'm sorry.

30:54.103 --> 30:57.440
The London stage
was my everything.

30:57.607 --> 30:59.984
Movies, no interest.

31:00.151 --> 31:03.321
And God save us all from that
vicious lie called California.

31:04.364 --> 31:07.283
Oh, there you are.
Where did you run off to?

31:08.701 --> 31:10.703
Hello.

31:10.870 --> 31:14.040
Agents Morgan and Clay,
Dr Johann Pryce,

31:14.207 --> 31:15.833
one of the greatest
research minds

31:16.000 --> 31:17.669
of this or any other generation.

31:17.835 --> 31:19.629
A national treasure.

31:20.630 --> 31:22.465
Too generous.
How can I help you?

31:22.632 --> 31:27.095
We have a warrant
to conduct a forensic audit.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.848
Financial records?

31:31.015 --> 31:33.142
Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs.

31:33.309 --> 31:35.687
We're investigating a report
of alleged noncompliance

31:35.853 --> 31:37.480
with federally funded
clinical trials

31:37.647 --> 31:40.024
for a medication manufactured
by Godfrey Industries.

31:40.191 --> 31:42.193
What sort of noncompliance?

31:42.360 --> 31:44.153
Paperwork Reduction Act.

31:46.739 --> 31:48.700
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

31:48.866 --> 31:52.579
Patients in the study are
required to fill out this form.

31:52.745 --> 31:54.372
There is supposed to be
a control number

31:54.539 --> 31:56.165
in the upper left-hand corner
of the document.

31:56.332 --> 31:59.168
As mandated by statute
and OMB directive 15.

31:59.335 --> 32:02.380
There's no such control number
in evidence on your form.

32:02.547 --> 32:04.424
You could be looking
at sanctions.

32:04.591 --> 32:06.426
As well as
an official reprimand.

32:07.468 --> 32:10.471
Oh, dear.

32:11.598 --> 32:15.059
You had the ability to cure my
cancer, you denied me treatment.

32:15.226 --> 32:17.186
Did you really think
there wouldn't be consequences?

32:17.353 --> 32:20.189
You have no idea of the
destruction you've just caused.

32:20.356 --> 32:23.568
You were the one who reacted
like a hysterical drag queen.

32:23.735 --> 32:26.696
Decades of research,
aeons of study and analysis.

32:26.863 --> 32:29.032
You brought this on yourself.

32:31.075 --> 32:33.244
What happened downstairs
was a warning shot.

32:33.411 --> 32:35.079
All it took was a phone call.

32:35.246 --> 32:36.914
Betray me again,
I'll let the whole world know

32:37.081 --> 32:39.542
what a twisted little prick
you really are.

32:39.709 --> 32:43.212
What will your legacy be
when I expose the atrocities

32:43.379 --> 32:45.131
that are being committed here
on a daily basis?

32:45.298 --> 32:47.091
I have my own secrets
to tell, Olivia, dear.

32:47.258 --> 32:49.636
Take your best shot, Johann.

32:55.516 --> 32:58.394
I need you to help me
find my granddaughter.

32:59.854 --> 33:01.481
What's in it for me?

33:01.648 --> 33:03.941
I help you find Spivak.
He's yours.

33:04.108 --> 33:06.361
Study him, dissect him,
write a paper,

33:06.527 --> 33:09.322
ride that flying lizard man
or whatever the hell he is

33:09.489 --> 33:12.158
to fame, fortune
and your place in history.

33:12.325 --> 33:13.951
Just bear in mind,

33:14.118 --> 33:17.455
whatever information
I provide you stays entre nous.

33:17.622 --> 33:21.793
If I agree to do this, promise
me no harm will come to Shelley.

33:21.959 --> 33:25.797
- Johann, honestly.
- I know what you're capable of.

33:25.963 --> 33:28.883
Would you stop talking nonsense?
She's my own flesh and blood.

33:29.050 --> 33:31.803
Yes, I know,
which is why I need your word.

33:34.389 --> 33:36.182
Fine.

33:38.351 --> 33:39.977
Oh, uh, one more thing.

33:40.144 --> 33:41.771
If, by chance, you envision

33:41.938 --> 33:43.564
something unfortunate
happening to me,

33:43.731 --> 33:45.358
everything I know about you

33:45.525 --> 33:47.193
goes immediately
to the authorities.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.820
Play nice.

34:02.667 --> 34:04.293
What are you thirsting for?

34:04.460 --> 34:06.129
Looking for someone.

34:06.295 --> 34:08.715
Here I was worried
I'd be replaced by a dating app.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.092
She was in here last night -

34:11.259 --> 34:14.094
dark eyes, black hair,
beautiful.

34:14.262 --> 34:16.889
What time exactly
did you see this vision?

34:17.056 --> 34:19.391
Depending on how late
and how much you were drinking,

34:19.559 --> 34:21.978
it gives me an idea of what type
of beautiful we're talking.

34:23.353 --> 34:25.148
Seriously beautiful.

34:26.399 --> 34:28.150
You're not some type of
douchebag ex, are you?

34:28.317 --> 34:30.527
If I was an ex, don't you think
I'd know her name?

34:30.695 --> 34:32.822
You'd be surprised.

34:39.245 --> 34:41.164
Ramos Fizz
with a shake of nutmeg.

34:41.330 --> 34:43.040
She's been coming here
the past few nights.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.083
Catch a name?

34:46.085 --> 34:47.712
Drinks I remember.

34:47.879 --> 34:50.422
Come tonight,
maybe you'll get lucky.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.908
- You're early.
- Would you please put that out?

35:17.074 --> 35:20.787
I don't know how anyone
can live with such a vile habit.

35:20.953 --> 35:23.623
You're lucky you don't have
an addictive personality.

35:23.790 --> 35:25.583
What do you have for me?

35:27.168 --> 35:29.045
Copies of everything
I turned over to the client.

35:29.212 --> 35:31.589
- Anything useful?
- Not really.

35:31.756 --> 35:33.966
Background on Spivak
that dead-ends.

35:34.133 --> 35:37.386
- Anything new on the girl?
- Nothing that gets us anywhere.

35:37.553 --> 35:39.847
You were right about one thing.

35:40.014 --> 35:42.350
Soon as I mentioned that baby,
he started twitching big-time.

35:42.517 --> 35:44.143
Wanted to shut it down
real quick.

35:44.310 --> 35:46.103
I know my son.

35:48.231 --> 35:50.733
I just didn't realise
how cheap he is.

35:52.151 --> 35:54.028
There's something
they're not telling me.

35:54.195 --> 35:55.822
Seems straightforward enough.

35:55.988 --> 35:58.241
Middle-aged doctor
swings with his chippy

35:58.407 --> 36:00.201
and takes my son's love child
with them.

36:00.368 --> 36:02.036
The dish ran away
with the spoon.

36:02.203 --> 36:03.830
Simple enough.

36:03.996 --> 36:07.124
Only I want my grandkid back and
I need you to make that happen.

36:07.291 --> 36:10.294
Anything I come up with,
you'll be the first to know.

36:12.505 --> 36:15.091
Did Roman ask after me?

36:15.258 --> 36:17.260
Your name didn't come up.

36:18.678 --> 36:20.596
How'd things work out
on that other matter?

36:20.763 --> 36:24.559
It was dreamy.

36:24.725 --> 36:28.104
Pryce would've shit his pants
if he wasn't such a tight ass.

36:28.271 --> 36:30.857
- Were those real agents?
- Oh, hell, yeah.

36:31.023 --> 36:33.901
So many government folks sitting
around looking to stay busy.

36:34.068 --> 36:36.571
Just gotta know
the right number to call.

36:36.737 --> 36:38.656
So it worked out?

36:38.823 --> 36:41.868
- Perfectly. Thank you, Mr Ochoa.
- Isaac.

36:43.744 --> 36:45.413
Keep my son close.

36:45.580 --> 36:47.456
I don't want him getting to
that child before I do.

36:47.623 --> 36:49.917
I'm real clear
on the assignment.

36:50.084 --> 36:53.838
I was thinking about
grabbing a bite. Interested?

36:54.839 --> 36:58.509
You have no idea
how tempting that sounds.

36:58.676 --> 37:02.054
- Another time maybe.
- You got it.

37:09.770 --> 37:12.648
Much as you can
from the cloud and...

37:12.815 --> 37:15.902
Then tell the cloud
to make it not impossible.

37:18.279 --> 37:21.282
Well, how 'bout this?
Godfrey Tech Support is fired.

37:21.449 --> 37:24.577
Now you can all go look for work
at the Imbecile Bar.

37:34.045 --> 37:35.671
What?

37:35.838 --> 37:37.506
- Your lunch is here.
- Oh, excellent.

37:37.673 --> 37:41.719
Uh, send in the delivery man,
and, um, hold all my calls.

37:55.232 --> 37:58.235
Come in. Come in.

38:02.531 --> 38:05.076
- Souvlaki you order?
- Yes.

38:05.242 --> 38:08.871
- $17.50.
- What an engaging accent.

38:09.038 --> 38:10.790
Do you mind if I ask
where you're from?

38:10.957 --> 38:14.418
- Athens. $17...
- Oh, I should have guessed.

38:14.585 --> 38:17.672
So musical, so Hellenic.

38:25.471 --> 38:27.181
My mother makes the finest.

38:27.348 --> 38:29.725
Lots of olives and garlic

38:29.892 --> 38:32.603
and just the right amount
of rosemary to make you weep.

38:32.770 --> 38:35.731
Not like this pig I work for
now. His food is garbage.

38:35.898 --> 38:38.025
Tastes like it comes
from a dog's...

38:43.364 --> 38:45.783
Positron emission tomography
engaged.

38:45.950 --> 38:48.869
Initiate upload
from digital substrate.

38:53.708 --> 38:55.459
Neural pathways
have been charted.

38:55.626 --> 38:57.795
Begin transfer.

39:01.924 --> 39:05.720
Process complete.
Beta waves are stable.

39:16.522 --> 39:18.315
It appears I've
achieved a successful transfer

39:18.482 --> 39:20.860
to a sentient host.

39:21.027 --> 39:22.778
Remarkable.

39:27.408 --> 39:29.910
How long have we been warehoused
on the hard drive?

39:30.077 --> 39:33.456
- Several weeks.
- What's it like in cyberspace?

39:34.790 --> 39:37.877
Like nothing. A black void.

39:38.044 --> 39:40.629
No form, no stimuli of any sort.

39:40.796 --> 39:42.465
Death digitised, I suppose.

39:42.631 --> 39:44.008
Fascinating.

39:46.802 --> 39:49.013
I have body odour.

39:49.180 --> 39:50.931
What this proves is that
consciousness is fungible...

39:51.098 --> 39:53.142
What have we found out
about the Spivak life form?

39:54.602 --> 39:56.228
Well, I'm still in the process
of mapping.

39:56.395 --> 39:58.773
Tell me we've determined at
least what genus it belongs to.

39:58.939 --> 40:01.192
There are still a certain number
of variables to be corrected.

40:01.358 --> 40:02.985
Good God, man!

40:03.152 --> 40:04.862
What the hell have
we been doing for six weeks?

40:05.029 --> 40:07.531
Why is this not solved?

40:07.698 --> 40:09.366
We are perhaps
the only scientists alive

40:09.533 --> 40:11.160
to have witnessed
this phenomenon

40:11.327 --> 40:12.995
and what do we have to show
for it?

40:13.162 --> 40:17.124
I've isolated 247 base paired
linear polymer nucleotides

40:17.291 --> 40:19.668
stranded by phosphodiester
linkages at position five.

40:19.835 --> 40:21.921
Anomalous trace purine
indicates...

40:22.088 --> 40:24.715
The hideout of a second-rate
mind is behind a wall of data.

40:24.882 --> 40:28.886
We viewed the specimen at
a distance of 53.5m 42 days ago,

40:29.053 --> 40:31.722
during which intervals
we also jerked off 83 times.

40:31.889 --> 40:34.350
The other hideout
of a second-rate mind.

40:34.517 --> 40:36.143
- Chronic masturbation.
- I am trying my best!

40:36.310 --> 40:40.022
By scarfing speed to paper over
your minuscule attention span.

40:40.189 --> 40:42.358
I suppose I should have
expected as much.

40:42.525 --> 40:45.194
After all, you continue to
make us skulk in darkness

40:45.361 --> 40:47.321
like some gay rat
hiding who and what we are.

40:47.488 --> 40:51.117
Johann, we won't find emotional
connection in a men's room

40:51.283 --> 40:52.910
or true love at a rest stop.

40:53.077 --> 40:55.913
- We both know...
- Shut your fucking mouth!

40:58.833 --> 41:00.751
You're pathetic.

41:01.836 --> 41:03.879
We need to own our truth.

41:04.046 --> 41:07.466
Live it. Be it.

41:09.468 --> 41:12.847
Mac...nam... They all laughed
at a clown's tiny...

41:13.013 --> 41:15.432
- What's wrong?
- Consciousness overlay.

41:15.599 --> 41:18.394
Penis, mac...is being rejected.

41:18.561 --> 41:22.773
- Shut it down.
- Pathetic. Mac...nam...

41:22.940 --> 41:25.901
Fish usage. Three, two...

41:26.068 --> 41:28.529
Mother. Penis is being rejected.

41:33.909 --> 41:35.619
Not a fucking word.

41:40.332 --> 41:42.168
You need to eat.

41:42.334 --> 41:45.880
Uh, the marble floors
in the master bathroom,

41:46.046 --> 41:48.382
uh, are they heated?

41:48.549 --> 41:51.802
Oh, well, that's unfortunate.

41:51.969 --> 41:55.181
Thank you. Yes.
No, we'll keep looking.

41:59.643 --> 42:02.771
Steak is rich in iron, we all
need iron to stay healthy.

42:04.440 --> 42:07.526
I want to talk to Uncle Norman.

42:11.322 --> 42:13.157
We went over this before, honey.

42:13.324 --> 42:15.576
Your Uncle Norman
is travelling abroad

42:15.743 --> 42:17.578
and we don't think
he's coming back.

42:17.745 --> 42:20.414
- Did he tell you that?
- He didn't have to.

42:20.581 --> 42:22.208
I could see it in his eyes.

42:22.374 --> 42:25.044
He wouldn't just leave
without letting me know.

42:25.211 --> 42:27.713
He would've called.

42:29.715 --> 42:32.551
He was so worried about you.

42:34.887 --> 42:37.097
Those hateful things
people accused you of,

42:37.264 --> 42:41.101
they hurt him so very badly,
Shelley.

42:41.268 --> 42:43.646
They hurt all of us,
but Norman...

42:43.812 --> 42:46.732
All the more reason
he wouldn't abandon me,

42:46.899 --> 42:49.193
just disappear like this.

42:52.988 --> 42:55.282
I know how much it hurts.

42:55.449 --> 42:57.993
He left me too, you know.

42:59.119 --> 43:03.040
I lie in bed at night
wondering why.

43:04.750 --> 43:08.295
But men leave.
That's what they do.

43:09.338 --> 43:12.591
If you can find it in your
heart, try to forgive him.

43:12.758 --> 43:15.427
I'm not there yet,
but, um, at the very least

43:15.594 --> 43:17.721
I don't blame him.

43:17.888 --> 43:20.182
He just wasn't strong
like you and me.

43:22.101 --> 43:24.770
It's time for your medication.

43:28.023 --> 43:30.276
OK.

43:34.446 --> 43:36.573
Hi. Remember me?

43:36.740 --> 43:39.702
I sucked your cock last night
before you ditched me.

43:39.868 --> 43:43.914
Oh, yeah. See, I had a situation...

43:45.040 --> 43:46.667
Cheers, asshole.

43:50.963 --> 43:53.966
Shame. You made a cute couple.

43:54.133 --> 43:56.844
It wasn't meant to be.

44:00.431 --> 44:03.642
Ramos Fizz, shake of nutmeg
for the lady.

44:03.809 --> 44:05.436
I'll take another two fingers,
neat.

44:05.602 --> 44:07.396
Seems like you made it
your business

44:07.563 --> 44:09.356
to find out my drink of choice.

44:10.357 --> 44:11.984
You wouldn't be stalking me?

44:12.151 --> 44:14.403
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

44:16.155 --> 44:20.284
- I'm Roman.
- Godfrey. I know.

44:20.451 --> 44:22.870
Is that a plus or a minus?

44:23.037 --> 44:24.830
Haven't decided.

44:26.790 --> 44:28.584
So, where are you from?

44:30.210 --> 44:32.046
Guess.

44:34.506 --> 44:37.343
- Heaven.
- You can do better than that.

44:37.509 --> 44:40.179
I know.
I just don't usually have to.

44:45.976 --> 44:48.937
Are you really going to
answer that?

44:49.104 --> 44:50.939
I'll just be a second.

44:53.942 --> 44:55.778
What are you doing
about getting me that nutrient?

44:57.196 --> 45:00.366
No, unacceptable.
I'm coming over.

45:00.532 --> 45:03.118
Figure this out by the time
I get there.

45:10.084 --> 45:11.710
There's a guy out there
somewhere

45:11.877 --> 45:13.670
who's already sick of her.

45:16.757 --> 45:19.551
It's not like making
chicken pot pie.

45:19.718 --> 45:22.179
The biologics were specifically
engineered to satiate

45:22.346 --> 45:25.057
upir nutritional
and metabolic needs.

45:25.224 --> 45:27.684
And they've all been destroyed.

45:27.851 --> 45:29.728
You have your mother to thank
for that.

45:30.729 --> 45:32.523
How long?

45:33.524 --> 45:36.110
If I had a team working
around the clock,

45:36.276 --> 45:37.945
a month at the earliest.

45:38.112 --> 45:39.738
Is that a joke?

45:42.741 --> 45:44.660
How am I supposed to feed?

45:44.827 --> 45:47.162
For the time being,
I suggest the old-fashioned way.

45:57.965 --> 45:59.842
Try not to leave any messes.

46:14.898 --> 46:17.025
How are you feeling?

46:17.192 --> 46:20.237
Like fat man
shit in my head.

46:20.404 --> 46:22.072
What happened?

46:22.239 --> 46:26.452
Well, you fainted,
but everything's fine now.

46:26.618 --> 46:28.412
Why it's night?

46:28.579 --> 46:30.205
Oh, you've been out
for quite a while.

46:30.372 --> 46:32.332
I recommend you see
your physician

46:32.499 --> 46:35.377
and have him test you
for narcolepsy.

46:48.640 --> 46:50.851
Is there something
you want to tell me?

46:53.270 --> 46:55.063
Most folks start with
how long it's been

46:55.230 --> 46:57.024
since their last confession.

47:00.235 --> 47:02.613
I'm not here for that.

47:02.779 --> 47:04.948
Then why are you here?

47:05.991 --> 47:07.951
I just needed a sounding board.

47:08.118 --> 47:09.745
I've already been to a bar

47:09.912 --> 47:12.623
and my favourite hooker is down
with a case of the clap, so...

47:12.789 --> 47:15.125
I'm the next best thing.

47:15.292 --> 47:17.127
Something like that, yeah.

47:21.673 --> 47:24.176
I'm about to do things
I don't want to.

47:25.302 --> 47:27.846
God gave you free will.
You have a choice.

47:29.264 --> 47:31.141
God?

47:32.142 --> 47:34.019
Yeah.

47:34.186 --> 47:37.856
As far as choice,
I don't get one.

47:40.692 --> 47:43.111
Sooner or later
I'm going to have to give in.

47:43.278 --> 47:46.365
It's gonna be ugly
and I'll have to live with it.

47:48.075 --> 47:51.745
Not that it matters, but I
assume you're not of the faith.

47:53.080 --> 47:55.249
You could tell?

47:55.415 --> 47:57.334
But you do seem to be
carrying guilt.

47:57.501 --> 47:59.336
I'm guessing
the reason you're here,

47:59.503 --> 48:02.464
even though
you're a nonbeliever, is because

48:02.631 --> 48:05.634
you're hoping for some kind of
pre-emptive absolution

48:05.801 --> 48:07.511
for the sins
you're about to commit.

48:07.678 --> 48:10.222
It doesn't work like that.

48:11.932 --> 48:13.725
Why not?

48:14.726 --> 48:17.938
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

48:24.987 --> 48:26.780
No-one can.

49:36.141 --> 49:39.186
You're not going to go
all bridezilla on me, are you?

49:39.353 --> 49:42.564
You kidding? I am easy-peasy.

49:44.524 --> 49:46.860
But it is the most important day
of my life.

49:47.027 --> 49:51.948
Any girl's, really,
so I want it to be right.

49:52.115 --> 49:53.909
Of course.

49:54.910 --> 49:56.912
The flower arrangements
need to have

49:57.079 --> 50:01.500
six 12-inch white Macedonian
roses - one red, three yellow.

50:01.667 --> 50:05.128
The reception is going to be
a five-course meal,

50:05.295 --> 50:07.673
sit-down for 300
with place cards.

50:07.839 --> 50:09.883
- I hate open seating.
- 300...

50:10.050 --> 50:13.136
And we're going to write
all of our own vows, of course.

50:13.303 --> 50:14.930
How soon can you get yours
to me?

50:15.097 --> 50:16.890
Because I need to have it
carved into granite

50:17.057 --> 50:18.850
for a wall plaque
to put over the fireplace

50:19.017 --> 50:22.813
just as a reminder of all the
promises that you made to me.

50:27.317 --> 50:30.028
I'm just fucking with you.

50:32.364 --> 50:34.366
You looked like
you were going to cry.

50:34.533 --> 50:36.410
I was.

50:37.452 --> 50:40.205
No, honestly, all I ask
is that you wear a suit.

50:40.372 --> 50:43.750
I want to see what you look like
dressed up, just once.

50:43.917 --> 50:47.003
I think I can accommodate you
on that.

50:48.046 --> 50:51.675
And kids. I want kids.

50:53.885 --> 50:57.472
We'll live in a beautiful house
by the ocean.

50:57.639 --> 51:00.350
Maybe have another getaway
in the mountains.

51:01.351 --> 51:04.187
And a couple Ducatis, of course.

51:05.647 --> 51:08.275
OK, if we're going to live large
and support a family,

51:08.442 --> 51:10.318
you're going to need to step up
your game.

51:11.570 --> 51:13.405
I already have.

51:30.672 --> 51:32.591
What are you doing?

51:32.758 --> 51:35.343
Uh, just giving you guys
some space.

51:35.510 --> 51:38.221
- Roman's got room, so...
- No way.

51:38.388 --> 51:41.057
Just because I'm engaged doesn't
mean you have to move out.

51:42.642 --> 51:44.686
You need to make your own life.

51:44.853 --> 51:46.897
It's time for you to be happy.
You deserve it.

51:47.063 --> 51:48.940
So do you.

51:53.069 --> 51:54.863
He does make you happy, right?

51:58.116 --> 52:00.368
Yeah.

52:00.535 --> 52:02.370
Good.

52:04.623 --> 52:06.458
You know...

52:07.876 --> 52:12.047
..wherever I am,
you'll always be welcome.

52:15.967 --> 52:17.969
Ride or die, cuz.

52:19.638 --> 52:21.473
Ride or die.

52:24.643 --> 52:27.646
My other favourite Rumancek.

52:27.813 --> 52:29.648
Oh, no.
Negative on the naked man hugs.

52:29.815 --> 52:31.942
We're family now. It's fine.
Come on.

52:32.108 --> 52:34.319
OK.

52:34.486 --> 52:36.321
Hey, can you give me a ride
to the warehouse?

52:36.488 --> 52:38.323
I need to see my uncle,
bike's in the shop.

52:38.490 --> 52:40.242
Fine, just put some pants on,
for God's sakes.

52:40.408 --> 52:42.202
OK.

52:54.548 --> 52:57.175
In all the excitement I forgot
to ask, how'd it go with the PI?

52:57.342 --> 52:58.969
Any news about Miranda?

52:59.135 --> 53:01.179
When I hear something,
I'll let you know.

53:05.934 --> 53:08.103
It's just frustrating, you know.

53:09.437 --> 53:11.606
Yeah. I get it.

53:13.733 --> 53:16.695
So I found some new buyers.

53:16.862 --> 53:18.738
They're willing to pay 1.7.

53:18.905 --> 53:20.657
You're shitting me!

53:20.824 --> 53:24.077
My brother,
I shit you not.

53:25.078 --> 53:26.705
And the best part,

53:26.872 --> 53:30.041
you and I are going to get
200,000 off the top.

53:31.209 --> 53:35.672
So...we're running game
on our own people?

53:35.839 --> 53:37.591
It's a finder's fee.

53:37.757 --> 53:40.927
We'll all be splitting
1.5 million instead of 1.2.

53:41.094 --> 53:43.221
I brokered the deal.
No-one knows the difference.

53:43.388 --> 53:46.224
- Everyone wins.
- So who are the buyers?

53:46.391 --> 53:49.060
An organisation
out of Pottstown.

53:52.564 --> 53:55.150
The Croatians are the only ones
who operate out of there.

53:58.445 --> 54:00.196
Shit.

54:00.363 --> 54:04.075
Andreas, you cannot fuck
with those people.

54:04.242 --> 54:06.661
If anything goes sideways, they
will ass-rape us with ice picks.

54:06.828 --> 54:08.580
I've got it handled.

54:09.581 --> 54:11.207
You do want your future nieces
and nephews

54:11.374 --> 54:13.168
to go to private school,
don't you?

54:17.339 --> 54:19.132
You gotta trust me.

54:20.717 --> 54:23.845
I'm the guy who saved your life,
remember?

54:31.895 --> 54:34.189
I swear to God, Andreas,
if anything goes...

54:34.356 --> 54:36.483
- I could kiss you on the mouth right...
- Don't!

54:38.693 --> 54:42.322
You do know you've got intimacy
issues, right?

55:26.199 --> 55:29.452
You! What the fuck was that?

55:42.382 --> 55:44.175
Don't!

55:55.228 --> 55:57.022
Who are you?

56:00.400 --> 56:02.444
My name is Annie...

56:03.528 --> 56:05.613
..and I am just like you.
