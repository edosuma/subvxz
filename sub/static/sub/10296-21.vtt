At least this way I know
exactly what I've got here.

I've got nothing here, Peg.

Well, don't worry, Al.

03:02.133 --> 03:04.701
I didn't marry you
for your money.

03:04.701 --> 03:08.367
I'm not really sure why I did,
but I know it wasn't money.

03:08.367 --> 03:10.934
Well, it must have been
that old family tradition:

Hey, Peg, listen.

because Steve and I are going
to the track tonight.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.234
That really hurts, Al.

You know, I purposely
didn't ask you

03:41.634 --> 03:42.968
for any money today,

That's where
all your money goes, you know.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.634
No, I don't think so, Peg.

to go with me.

04:02.167 --> 04:03.834
Ah, thanks, Steve,

04:03.834 --> 04:05.634

04:16.801 --> 04:18.801
be sure to bet whatever Al bets,

because as you can see,

04:20.534 --> 04:22.033
he's a winner.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.501
Take it easy, Al. It happens.

Wow, Hondo.
You are much man.

05:18.467 --> 05:21.968
that it gives me great pleasure
to share with my wife.

What I am ashamed to say is
that's a total lie.

what I'm going to do with it,

and you're going to do
the same thing.

Oh, why would I do that?
Because you have to.

05:38.067 --> 05:39.701
If Marcy finds out
that you won money,

05:39.701 --> 05:43.000
she's going to know I won money,
and then Peg here will know.

05:44.934 --> 05:46.334
Al, what you're asking me to do

05:46.334 --> 05:47.901

to lie to my wife,

was dated three days ago,

09:58.868 --> 10:00.968
and fondling his car keys
like usual?

10:02.334 --> 10:05.634
Yeah, and I watched him shave
this morning.

near the jugular.

the least your husband can do
is to burn right beside you.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.467
Well, love touches us all
in different ways, I suppose.

11:53.467 --> 11:54.734
But early on,

11:54.734 --> 11:56.567
Steve and I decided
to share everything

11:56.567 --> 11:58.534
and keep no secrets
from each other.

11:58.534 --> 12:01.400
Huh. Well, I would keep
a good eye on him, Marce,

12:01.400 --> 12:04.701
because God only knows
what ideas Al put in his head

12:04.701 --> 12:05.934
when they went
to the track.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.868
Steve went to the track?

12:09.734 --> 12:11.534
You know,
I thought it was kind of odd

12:11.534 --> 12:13.868
that Al went with him
to the library.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.267
Steve has money too.

12:19.267 --> 12:21.300
No, I won't believe it.

12:21.300 --> 12:24.968
He would never keep
something like that from me.

12:24.968 --> 12:26.300
And I'm so sure of it

12:26.300 --> 12:28.834
that I'm going to tear my home
apart piece by piece.

12:28.834 --> 12:32.467
You'll see. I won't find
so much as a dollar.

12:32.467 --> 12:34.467
And if I do,
I'll take his pride and joy

12:34.467 --> 12:37.133
and superglue it
to a ferris wheel.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.133
So did you find anything?

12:43.133 --> 12:45.767
Uh... Aw,
I'm a little tired.

12:45.767 --> 12:47.667
I'm going to go upstairs
and study.

13:06.868 --> 13:08.434
Hi there, shoe man.

13:13.734 --> 13:15.868
I was in last week,

13:15.868 --> 13:19.367
and I can't stop thinking
about you.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.934
Remember me?

13:22.934 --> 13:24.367
Nightly.

13:25.968 --> 13:27.467
I mean, vaguely.

13:27.467 --> 13:29.501
Can I help you?

13:29.501 --> 13:31.734
I don't know how else to say it.

13:31.734 --> 13:33.434
I want you!

13:33.434 --> 13:37.100
Oh, that's so nice.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.200
But I'm married.

13:39.200 --> 13:43.367
Perfect. That means
you're already broken in.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.234
Al.

14:00.234 --> 14:01.567
Al?

14:09.667 --> 14:10.734
What do you want?

14:10.734 --> 14:13.133
Can't you see I'm busy?

14:17.834 --> 14:19.634
Look, Al, I--
I have to talk to you.

14:19.634 --> 14:20.734
I'm really feeling guilty

14:20.734 --> 14:23.167
about hiding that money
from Marcy,

14:23.167 --> 14:25.167
so could you do me a favor
and spend yours

14:25.167 --> 14:26.434
so I can share mine?

14:26.434 --> 14:29.133
I can't stand the way she looks
at me, with such trust.

14:29.133 --> 14:30.267
You sure?

14:30.267 --> 14:31.868
A lot of guys mistake trust
for that

14:31.868 --> 14:34.000
just-keep-the-checks-coming-in-
or-you're-out-of-here look.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.501
They're very similar, you know.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.400
Al, what's the big deal?
Just buy something.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.167
It's not as easy
as that, Steve.

14:40.167 --> 14:42.167
When you were a kid,
didn't you ever find money

14:42.167 --> 14:43.767
in the street,
and you were so excited,

14:43.767 --> 14:45.601
you couldn't figure out
what to do with it?

14:45.601 --> 14:47.033
No, Al.

14:47.033 --> 14:49.567
I gave it to Bunny Zackmeyer
so I could look up her dress.

14:52.501 --> 14:55.033
I'm talking about
when you were a kid, Steve.

14:55.033 --> 14:58.634
Look, could you just give me
a couple of more days?

14:58.634 --> 15:00.601
In the name of friendship.
Huh, buddy?

15:00.601 --> 15:03.033
Okay, in the name
of friendship,

15:03.033 --> 15:05.734
which, at today's rates,
is another 50 bucks.

15:05.734 --> 15:08.334
You're a weenie, Steve.

15:08.334 --> 15:11.334
Yes, but a weenie
with a hundred bucks.

15:11.334 --> 15:13.367
Oh, by the way, Al,
you want a ride home?

15:13.367 --> 15:14.367
No, I got my car.

15:14.367 --> 15:15.968
Yeah, I saw it in the lot,

15:15.968 --> 15:17.601
but it might be tough to drive

15:17.601 --> 15:19.501
with all that broken glass
on your seat.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.167
Don't worry.
It wasn't vandalism.

15:21.167 --> 15:22.200
They stole your radio.

15:23.434 --> 15:25.200
Great!

15:25.200 --> 15:27.367
Well, that's actually
what I was thinking,

15:27.367 --> 15:29.634
but it's not something
you say to a friend.

15:29.634 --> 15:31.334
No, Steve.

15:31.334 --> 15:34.968
Now I know what to buy,
a new car stereo.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.267
It's perfect.

15:36.267 --> 15:37.834
See, now I can buy something

15:37.834 --> 15:39.934
for one of my favorite
places in the world,

15:39.934 --> 15:41.367
my car.

15:41.367 --> 15:44.000
Because when I'm in my car,
I don't have any wife or kids.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.634
I'm alone. I'm whole.

15:45.634 --> 15:48.567
I'm with the one I love.

15:48.567 --> 15:51.501
And Peggy never drives my car,
so she'll never know.

15:51.501 --> 15:52.701
Tee hee.

15:52.701 --> 15:55.834
I get to spend all my money
on me. Oh, man!

15:55.834 --> 15:57.734
I'll have it installed tomorrow.

15:57.734 --> 15:59.133
Come on, let's go buy it now.

15:59.133 --> 16:00.667
But it's a half-hour
till closing.

16:00.667 --> 16:03.100
Ah, the place is a graveyard.
No one comes in here.

16:03.100 --> 16:04.534
Just give me
a couple of minutes.

16:04.534 --> 16:06.133
I'll turn off the lights
in the storeroom.

16:10.300 --> 16:11.834
Ew.

16:24.234 --> 16:27.267
I'm sorry, miss,
but the place is closed.

16:27.267 --> 16:28.534
Gee, that's funny.

16:28.534 --> 16:32.234
Most stores don't close
until I'm in the dressing room.

16:32.234 --> 16:33.667
Oh, well.

16:38.467 --> 16:41.434
Mm-mm-mm.

Ready to go, buddy?

16:42.968 --> 16:44.133
You bet.

nobody comes in this late.

are you doing down there?

Al, did I just hear Ted Koppel
singing "Proud Mary"?

18:34.834 --> 18:36.834
Yeah. It's sweeps month.

18:38.567 --> 18:41.100
So what do you want, Peg?

18:41.100 --> 18:42.300
Oh, I thought
I'd come down

18:42.300 --> 18:43.334
so we could cuddle.

18:43.334 --> 18:45.167
We haven't done that
for a long time.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.934
Oh, Peg, just once,
couldn't we do something I like?

to dig in my ear

No.

down here anyway.

I just wanted
to throw something over me.

19:05.901 --> 19:07.434
No, don't go in there!

Well, why?

He's going to need it
for a couple of weeks.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.067

your car.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.701
So you want to sell
your car stereo

19:46.701 --> 19:49.334
after just one day.

19:49.334 --> 19:51.534
I don't want to sell it.
I have to.

Peg's going to be
driving my car for two weeks.

19:53.934 --> 19:55.901
That means two weeks
of hiding my stereo.

Do you know what I have to do
to hide my stereo, Steve?
