MOHINDER:
Previously on Heroes.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.245
I think our only
real option at this point

00:06.340 --> 00:07.921
is to get the Unites States
Government involved.

00:08.009 --> 00:09.874
/ want to round them up
and put them in a facility

00:09.969 --> 00:11.630
where they won’t be
a danger to anyone.

00:11.721 --> 00:14.679
What would your hunter do
if he knew you were
one of them, too?

00:16.100 --> 00:18.682
Who are you?
And what do you want?

00:18.978 --> 00:20.843
I want you to
get in the van.

00:33.409 --> 00:35.149
If you don't want
to see them punished,
what do you want?

00:35.244 --> 00:36.780
I want them to pay.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.992
What are you saying
to her, Nathan?

00:40.082 --> 00:42.869
You're telling her
that I'm unstable? Crazed?

00:43.628 --> 00:44.663
You look me up.

00:44.754 --> 00:46.460
It's over, Pete.
Give up.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.579
No, this is the beginning.

00:54.347 --> 00:56.679
MR. BENNET:
Has it ever occurred to you
that I don't have a choice?

00:56.766 --> 00:58.222
There is always a choice!

00:58.309 --> 00:59.890
...and they have made it
very clear to me

00:59.977 --> 01:02.719
that if I am not on board,
that Claire will be
on that list!

01:02.813 --> 01:05.646
Your mother wants me
to move out of the house
for a while.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.145
She's right.

01:16.994 --> 01:18.450
MOHINDER:
I don't like this, Matt.

01:18.537 --> 01:20.038
MATT: Well, you got
any better ideas?

01:20.122 --> 01:22.579
MOHINDER: It's a huge risk,
being out in the open.
We should be laying low.

01:22.667 --> 01:26.410
And what? What?
Run forever?

01:26.504 --> 01:29.211
I don't know.
Yeah. That's my point.

01:29.298 --> 01:33.337
We're being hunted,
and we have no idea
by who, how, why.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.258
Noah Bennet has
all the answers
that we're looking for.

01:35.346 --> 01:37.507
Hey, did you get it?
Yeah.

01:38.933 --> 01:41.640
Amobarbital.
One dose of this,
he's knocked out cold.

01:43.145 --> 01:44.521
What? What's wrong?

01:45.273 --> 01:47.514
Can't you just read his mind?
Get what we need that way?

01:47.608 --> 01:49.018
No. We've been over this.

01:49.110 --> 01:51.726
Noah is too well-trained,
and he's never off his guard.

01:51.821 --> 01:55.734
Guys, look, I was a cop.
You're a scientist. A nurse.

01:55.825 --> 01:58.111
We did nothing wrong,
and they turned us
into fugitives.

01:58.202 --> 02:00.784
But drugging
and kidnapping people?

02:00.871 --> 02:03.453
Look, I don't like it,
either, but this way,
it gives us answers.

02:03.541 --> 02:06.954
Yeah, straight up
interrogation isn't going
to work, not with Bennet.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.659
We need to get creative.

Yeah.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.154
Just for a little while.

02:41.245 --> 02:45.409
I'm actually looking
for an apartment in town,
if you know of anything.

03:22.995 --> 03:26.032

our friend here had
about three too many.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.284
Don't worry.
We'll get him home safe.

03:43.641 --> 03:45.131
It's working.

04:07.164 --> 04:11.578
Ten people died last night
in Ohio when a house
spontaneously caught on fire.

04:11.669 --> 04:14.581
I'm thinking
we should investigate
sooner rather than later.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.841
It's over, Noah.
It's all over.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.416
Primatech may have burned
to the ground, but that
doesn't change anything.

04:20.511 --> 04:21.967
We have a lot
of work to do.

04:22.054 --> 04:25.217
Primatech should
have been shut down
a longtime ago.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.764
The Company had a good run,
but its time has passed.

04:27.852 --> 04:30.810
No. We got the job done.

04:30.896 --> 04:34.730
Yes, you certainly did,
and I appreciate it.

04:39.363 --> 04:41.103
What is this?

04:41.198 --> 04:45.316
For your years of service.
Pension. Severance.

04:46.162 --> 04:47.823
And this is from me.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.958
Why are you doing this?

05:03.053 --> 05:06.136
Bag and tag.
One of us,
one of them.

05:06.223 --> 05:10.182
It's an antiquated system
desperately trying
to remain relevant.

05:10.269 --> 05:12.601
So, we adapt
and we get it right.

05:12.688 --> 05:17.352
I don't think we can,
I don't think we should.
lam tired, Noah.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.813
l have told so many lies.

05:20.905 --> 05:25.194
Maybe it's not too late
to cobble my family
back together.

05:26.076 --> 05:29.864
But it's a good thing.
You get to go home,
to Claire.

05:29.955 --> 05:33.072
This is everything
you've ever fought for,
and you won.

05:40.424 --> 05:42.255
This is all I've ever known.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.844
What am I supposed
to do now?

05:47.932 --> 05:49.388
Take care of Claire.

able to get to these memories
that we're looking for.

how this whole thing happened,

06:17.086 --> 06:19.077
who's behind it
and how they work.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.878
We're gonna find out
how to stop hiding
and start fighting back.

06:21.966 --> 06:24.207
And how far are you
willing to push?

06:24.301 --> 06:25.586
(GASPS)

06:25.678 --> 06:28.385
As far as I need to.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.613
This better be good.

06:51.704 --> 06:53.660
Face time at state dinners
is hard to come by.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.575
You heard from Bennet?
No. Why?

06:55.666 --> 06:57.702
He's off the grid,
going on three hours.

06:57.793 --> 06:59.909
Standing orders are
to check in after duty.
He didn't.

07:00.296 --> 07:04.335
What about Claire?
Is she okay?
Yes. Your daughter's fine.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.416
I want every inch
of surveillance
on Noah Bennet.

everywhere he might go.

myself included.

You and Bennet,
you're both compromised.

07:17.563 --> 07:18.769
What's that supposed
to mean?

07:18.856 --> 07:20.437
Your brother, Peter,
your daughter, Claire...

07:20.524 --> 07:21.764
Peter gets treated
like everyone else.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.941
Yeah, and Claire
gets a free pass.

07:24.028 --> 07:26.770
That makes both
yours and Bennet's
choices tarnished.

07:31.327 --> 07:35.445
Are you spying on me?
You barely touched
your prime rib.

07:47.551 --> 07:48.586
Everything okay
out there?

07:48.677 --> 07:51.293
Yeah, it still feels
like we're sitting ducks
in here, come on.

07:51.388 --> 07:52.844
We can't rush
an interrogation.

07:52.931 --> 07:57.220
This isn't an interrogation.
lt's torture. You're straining
his entire system.

a personal vendetta, yeah.

you're talking about.

08:08.072 --> 08:10.313
This isn't about Daphne.
This is about me
helping everybody.

08:10.407 --> 08:11.863
Well, you're not
helping him.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.157
He has done
much worse to me.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.496
You're better than him,
Matt. That's my point.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.992
No, the point is
he's in pain.
Does he have to be?

08:19.083 --> 08:21.825

It's not gonna be
comfortable.

through his brain...

information's been tainted
by time and perception?

08:31.095 --> 08:33.632
We know nothing.
He knows everything
that we need to know.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.098
He's right.

to go back in now?

with them at Lyle's school.
They're nice.

any other plans,
did you?

No, no.
It sounds great.

Actually, at the mall, maybe.

She's at the library.
Secret Service thing.
Of course.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.628
I didn't want her
to see me here.
I wanted to talk to you alone.

Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Come on in.

What's going on?
I've set some
things in motion.

10:53.695 --> 10:57.187
Everything's gonna change,
and ljust want you to know
Claire's going to be safe.

10:57.282 --> 10:58.783
What do you mean "safe"?

10:59.827 --> 11:01.283
What have you done?

11:03.205 --> 11:08.370
Noah, I got into politics
so I could help people,
make the big impact.

11:08.460 --> 11:09.495
What have you done?

11:09.586 --> 11:13.044
I'm certain that you involved
yourself with the Company
for the same reason.

11:13.131 --> 11:18.467
You sensed there was a need.
Well, that need still exists.

11:19.096 --> 11:21.963

are a threat.

11:22.057 --> 11:26.266

11:26.353 --> 11:28.890
Primatech never did the job
that was required of them.

11:28.981 --> 11:30.562

the solution.

11:30.649 --> 11:33.356
The United States government
has the resources
and the authority

11:33.443 --> 11:35.604

but I need your help.

What do you plan to do
once you have everybody?

11:58.886 --> 12:02.549
We find an answer.
We get the best
team of scientists

12:02.639 --> 12:05.221
and we find a way
to eliminate these
abilities forever.

12:05.309 --> 12:07.550
And if that's not possible?
I refuse to accept that.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.680

were given to me.
They can be taken away.

to be seen as a villain,

lneedto.

look at you
the same way again.

to know this.

and they will blame you.

so far around the bend.

to make things right.

12:44.473 --> 12:49.012
You spent 20 years
tracking these people.
I want to know how you did it.

13:11.041 --> 13:14.249
What is all this stuff?
This is the last
20 years of my life.

13:26.723 --> 13:31.638
And you kept it.
It's hard to throw
this stuff away.

I am the US Government.

We have loads of
weapons and stuff.

13:38.777 --> 13:43.316
lreaHze
you don't need weapons,
but you need perspective

13:43.407 --> 13:45.739
and you need
to control information.

13:45.826 --> 13:49.694
In 30 seconds, you undid
a secret that we've kept
for over 30 years.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.824
I can't un-ring that bell.
I know you can't.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.451
Okay.

13:53.542 --> 13:58.332
Look, ljoined the Company
for a reason, and that
reason doesn't disappear

decides to turn off
the lights.

14:01.299 --> 14:05.087

the extra time
with your family.

all with Nathan.

14:22.446 --> 14:23.811
They did it together.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.363
Did you hear what
I just said? Your brother
is to blame for all of it.

14:30.454 --> 14:31.660
Yeah, I know.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.871
So?
So? So what?

14:34.958 --> 14:37.074
I tried to stop him,
it didn't happen.

14:37.169 --> 14:38.705
Okay. But what are we
gonna do, nothing?

14:38.795 --> 14:41.207
Well, we can't do anything
from memories, can we?

14:41.298 --> 14:43.163
I've never done this before.
It's not an exact science.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.541
It's not science
at all, Matt.
You wanna go, just go.

14:45.677 --> 14:48.669
That's not what I'm saying.
No, but it's what
you're thinking.

14:49.639 --> 14:53.223
You think you
deserve this, to be hunted,
after all that you've done.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.478
You're reading my mind?
I don't have
to read your mind.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.768
You're an open book.

14:56.855 --> 14:59.141
Look, you want
to get caught?
Fine, turn yourself in.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.221
But we're not lugging
ourbaggage.

15:00.317 --> 15:01.807
I could say
the same thing
aboutyou.

15:01.902 --> 15:05.019
I told you this is
not about Daphne!
Stop! Both of you.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.853
We're supposed to be
on the same side.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.280
MATT: You don't think
what I'm getting
here is real?

15:10.243 --> 15:12.154
Fine. Fine.

15:17.959 --> 15:22.498
ln here, it is filled
with things we need,
guns, money... Go.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.298
Go!
I'll go.

15:29.638 --> 15:31.424

16:35.412 --> 16:38.119
Sir, I think
l have something.
Where?

16:44.087 --> 16:45.327
Gotcha.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.016
NATHAN: Where is he?

16:57.100 --> 16:59.887
Costa Verde,
breaking into Bennet's
storage facility.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.185
It's a live feed?
Yeah.

17:02.272 --> 17:04.888
I've got a local team
on the move
to apprehend him.

17:06.401 --> 17:09.063
How does he know
about Bennet's
storage facility?

17:09.154 --> 17:11.941
Are they working together?
I'm reserving judgment.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.110
I want him caught.

17:15.202 --> 17:18.786
He's in a room
stoCked full of guns.
Am I Clear?

17:18.872 --> 17:20.112
You're risking
your own men's lives.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.449
I want Peter caught.
No bloodshed.

17:24.628 --> 17:26.459
You gentlemen hear that?

17:27.130 --> 17:29.837

been baCk by now.

17:59.496 --> 18:02.488
Yeah, just give him
some more time.

18:03.667 --> 18:07.626
I'll tell you
why Peter isn't here.
He's been captured or killed.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.577
Shut him up.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.750
They'll be looking
for me by now.
Come on, do it.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.969
Mohinder knows I'm right.
My storage unit
is under surveillance.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.009
You sent Peter right
where they wanted him.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.428
He'd say anything
to get the hell
out of here.

18:18.515 --> 18:21.928
That doesn't mean I'm lying.
And you know me well enough
to know that's true.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.849
Matt, we should go.
He's right.

18:23.937 --> 18:27.805
Your only hope is to
let me go and escape
while you can, Matt.

18:27.899 --> 18:30.106
Wait a second,
I'm not finished.

18:30.193 --> 18:34.903
You said you Check in.
With who? Who else are you
working with? Show me.

18:35.031 --> 18:38.194
I'm not letting you
in my head.
You can't stop me.

DANKO:
Welcome to Building 26.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.459
| see the government
spares no penny.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.887
Not on equipment,
not on personnel.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.134
We're building
an elite team.

19:02.225 --> 19:03.840
Well, I'm glad
to be part of it.

19:03.935 --> 19:06.551
Now, there are a few
ground rules that
I would like to implement.

19:06.646 --> 19:10.480
Primatech had a system.
One of us, one of them.

19:10.567 --> 19:13.604
Working alongside
people with abilities.

19:13.695 --> 19:16.983
It helps to even the odds.
Yes, | read your files.

19:17.073 --> 19:20.907
I think we'd be better
served with one of us
and one of us.

19:22.329 --> 19:27.949
I'm sorry?
Or 10 of us, 12 of us,
and none of them.

19:29.419 --> 19:33.913
A lot of the people you're
targeting are good people.
They're useful people.

19:34.007 --> 19:36.749
Well, this isn't
about ethics.
It's about trust.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.129
About us and them.

19:40.889 --> 19:43.175
By your own admission,
your way didn't exactly work.

19:43.266 --> 19:45.723
Prisoners escaping,
loyaHyissues”.
It was a mess.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.471
A mess?

19:47.562 --> 19:49.803
For 20 years,
l was successful
in making sure

19:49.898 --> 19:53.891
that people like you
never knew people
like them even existed.

19:55.570 --> 19:58.437
Do not presume
to know anything
about me.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.077
I thought I was
running this operation.

20:07.165 --> 20:10.532
Well, the situation
has become a little
bit more complex, Noah.

20:10.627 --> 20:15.542
It's important that we look
at everything from as many
angles as we can, okay?

20:30.105 --> 20:32.096
Glad to see you got
your old job baCk.

20:36.403 --> 20:39.315
How else would
I randomly bump into
old acquaintances?

20:41.074 --> 20:45.192
Something big is happening.
I need your help.

20:45.328 --> 20:48.912
Why would I believe
anything you say?
Because it's true.

20:48.998 --> 20:52.991
I realize we haven't
always played nice
with eaCh other,

20:53.086 --> 20:55.077
but you have
a unique perspective.

20:58.967 --> 21:03.006
What exactly is happening?
A government program.

21:04.013 --> 21:08.347
And it is going
to blow up in their face.
I need you Mohinder.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.175
I need your brain,
I need your strength.

21:10.270 --> 21:15.185
Together,
we can help people,
we can save lives.

(BOTH EXHALING)

21:25.243 --> 21:28.201

What?

21:29.122 --> 21:31.534
ljust saw you
and him in a cab.

21:34.335 --> 21:37.293
You knew about this.
You didn't tell him?

21:38.381 --> 21:41.623
All right, Matt,
let me explain.
Why didn't you tell him?

21:41.718 --> 21:43.174
I wasn't talking
to anybody.

21:43.261 --> 21:44.501
I thought it was
the safest thing.

21:44.596 --> 21:49.135
That's why you didn't want me
in his head. You didn't
care about his health.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.555
You were afraid
of what I'd find.
No.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.307
Yes, he approached me.
But I said no!

21:56.232 --> 21:58.188
You should have
told me about this.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.313
Why didn't you tell me?

22:01.404 --> 22:03.144

What could I have done?
lwas tied up

22:12.248 --> 22:13.624
You think I don't
regret any of this!

22:13.708 --> 22:16.199
You were my friend!
You could have warned me!

22:16.294 --> 22:18.501
You could have
warned all of us!
I didn't know what to do.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.962
I didn't believe him!
Even after the plane,
the least you could...

22:21.049 --> 22:23.540
What? Told you that
I could've stopped
all of this,

22:23.635 --> 22:26.172
that I could have
maybe prevented
Daphne's death?

22:28.473 --> 22:32.307
If I had,
I'd probably be the one
tied up in that Chair.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.487
Come on!

22:48.451 --> 22:50.487
All right,
Check baCk there.

to feel everything.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.880
You always have a plan,
now you're gonna
share it with us.

23:46.968 --> 23:48.924
Listen to Peter,
get the hell out of here
while you still can.

23:49.012 --> 23:51.970
How much time
do you think you have,
Matt, before they find us?

23:52.056 --> 23:53.921
Maybe we should
just take what
Peter has and run.

23:54.017 --> 23:55.757
You don't get a vote!

23:55.893 --> 23:57.758
What are you
talking about?
Nothing!

23:57.854 --> 24:01.472
Mohinder knew
that we were gonna get
attacked by the government.

24:01.566 --> 24:02.772
Is that true?

24:02.859 --> 24:04.975
Bennet came to me, yes,
but I didn't believe him.

24:05.069 --> 24:07.230
He manipulated me before,
and I didn't think
I could trust him.

24:07.322 --> 24:08.937
Why didn't you
say something?

24:09.032 --> 24:11.148
As if any of you
would believe me,
after what I've done.

24:11.284 --> 24:12.615
Yeah, it's better
that we didn't.
PETER: Look, come on.

24:12.702 --> 24:14.533
You're a coward!
Can you get anything
more out of him?

24:14.621 --> 24:16.486
Yeah. I was just
about to do that.

on the wrong foot.

we could talk.

What are we gonna
talk about?

25:12.387 --> 25:14.628
We're gonna be
working together.

I thought maybe it'd be
a good idea ifwe...

What? Got to know
eaCh other better?

the other guy
was coming from.

you're coming from.

are unreliable.

You don't know anything
about me. That's the whole
point of this, you know?

All that time you worked
at your company,

26:00.768 --> 26:05.137
you danced
the fine line between
company man and family man.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.106
I'm not much for danCing.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.147
You're over-simplifying it.

over-complicating it.

26:15.658 --> 26:17.649
Hunting them
or harboring them.

26:18.494 --> 26:23.363
To win this war for good,
it takes focus,

26:24.333 --> 26:26.870

a little split right now.

I've read your files,

Is that right?

26:35.636 --> 26:39.049
Sure. Simple, unconnected,

26:39.140 --> 26:42.177

You think that
makes you perfect.

Not perfect,
just better than you.

you're hunting,
they're people.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.140

This job is about
understanding their humanity,
not their ability.

26:59.202 --> 27:01.864

human to do that.

27:04.207 --> 27:06.038
You're a valuable asset,

27:07.293 --> 27:12.003
but once we begin engagement,
l have to know,
are you gonna take orders,

27:13.049 --> 27:15.665
or continue undermining me
with every glance?

we want to hurt them.

No, Peter.
You're making a big mistake.

No, sir, not Bennet.

Did you mobilize a unit?
I was waiting for
your order, Senator.

who's driving all this.

Do it.

No.

with a mission,

who is hunting us.

And it's not ever
gonna stop.

what I want.
