â™ªâ™ª

00:40.207 --> 00:41.808
(Sighs)

00:41.841 --> 00:43.243
Still Not Straight, Is It?

00:43.276 --> 00:48.115
Nope. Want Me To Get
The Ladder Out Again?

00:48.148 --> 00:50.350
Nope. Just Give Me A Leg Up.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.518
What?

00:51.551 --> 00:53.754
You're Not
Seriously Going To--

00:57.356 --> 01:01.128
(Humming)

01:10.269 --> 01:13.272
Skylar, You'll Break Your Neck!

01:13.305 --> 01:15.741
(Screams) Don't Do It!

01:15.775 --> 01:17.578

01:26.585 --> 01:28.388
How's That?

01:28.421 --> 01:34.194

01:34.227 --> 01:35.496
Okay.

01:35.528 --> 01:38.131
(Both Chuckle)

01:38.165 --> 01:40.400
Wow.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.503
How Many Years Of Gymnastics
Went Into That?

01:42.536 --> 01:46.173
Six... And A Half.

01:46.206 --> 01:48.408
(Chuckles)

01:48.441 --> 01:51.578
That Was A Real "Please Do Not
Try This At Home" Moment.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.280
Do You Try That At Home?

01:53.313 --> 01:55.281
Because If You Do,
I Totally Get Why

01:55.314 --> 01:56.884
Your Parents
Are So Overprotective.

01:56.917 --> 02:00.153
Speaking Of My Parents,
I Gotta Be Home By 6:00.

02:00.186 --> 02:01.822
You Ready?

02:00.186 --> 02:01.822
Yeah.

02:01.855 --> 02:04.158
I'll Just Get My Bag.

02:04.191 --> 02:07.194
Hey, Sky. Before You Leave,
You Want To Sing A Little?

02:07.227 --> 02:08.662
Sure.

02:08.693 --> 02:12.865
Â™ª I Just Wanna Scream Out Loud â™ª

02:12.899 --> 02:16.503
â™ª Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now â™ª

02:16.536 --> 02:20.407
â™ª I'm Never
Coming Off This Cloud â™ª

02:20.439 --> 02:23.743
â™ª So Move Over,
Move Over, Move Over â™ª

02:23.776 --> 02:27.446
â™ª You Don't Wanna Mess With Me â™ª

02:27.479 --> 02:31.250

â™ª Never Gonna Slow Me Down â™ª

â™ª Nothing's Gonna Stop Me â™ª

02:43.496 --> 02:46.700
â™ª Nothing's Gonna Stop Me â™ª

02:56.408 --> 02:58.245
(Chuckles)

02:56.408 --> 02:58.245
Nice.

02:58.277 --> 02:59.645
That Was Awesome, Skylar.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.715
You Guys
Are Gonna Rock Tomorrow.

03:01.747 --> 03:03.282
You Think?

03:03.316 --> 03:06.286
Uh, Excuse Me, Rehearsing Here.

03:06.318 --> 03:08.254
Why Don't You Take It
From The Top--

03:08.288 --> 03:10.724
With A Professional Singer?

03:10.757 --> 03:12.225
Snap.

03:12.258 --> 03:15.228
Hey, Sky...

03:15.262 --> 03:16.763
Thanks For Helping Set Up.

03:16.795 --> 03:17.830
No Problem.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.641
He So Likes You.

03:27.674 --> 03:30.944
Ryan? Please.
We've Been Friends For, Like, Ever.

03:30.977 --> 03:33.280
And He's Got
A Girlfriend.

03:33.312 --> 03:35.715
Ex-Girlfriend.
He And Myra Broke Up.

03:35.748 --> 03:39.252
Again? Wow.
They're Tough To Keep Track Of.

03:39.286 --> 03:40.721
I Wonder If There's
An App For That.

03:40.753 --> 03:42.555
It's Just Because
She Sings In The Band.

03:42.588 --> 03:44.890
She Practically
Forces Him To Date Her.

03:44.924 --> 03:46.393
You're The One
He Really Likes.

03:46.425 --> 03:47.560
You're Delusional.

03:47.593 --> 03:49.295
And You Are Oblivious.

03:49.329 --> 03:50.296
I Am Not Oblivious.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.398
Yes, You Are.

03:51.431 --> 03:53.800
Wait, Why Are You
Going That Way?

03:53.832 --> 03:55.301
To Cut Through The Cemetery.

03:55.335 --> 03:57.304
It's The Only Way
I'll Get Home In Time.

03:57.336 --> 03:59.939
(Growls)

04:02.408 --> 04:06.545
Um, Sky, Hey,
I'm-- I'm Not So Sure That This Is A Good Idea.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.548
What Are You So Worried About?

04:08.580 --> 04:11.384
I Mean, Come On,
What's So Scary About A Cemetery?

04:11.418 --> 04:12.385
Dead People!

04:12.419 --> 04:14.354
(Scoffs)

04:14.387 --> 04:17.824
No, Seriously, There Are,
Like, Dead People Everywhere.

04:17.857 --> 04:21.361
Come On,
It's Not The Dead People You Gotta Worry About.

04:21.394 --> 04:22.995
It's The Ones
That Were Buried Alive.

04:23.028 --> 04:25.831
Aah! Just Change The Subject
Before I Have A Panic Attack!

04:25.865 --> 04:29.069
Okay. You Know,
If If Ryan Really Liked Me,

04:29.101 --> 04:31.370
Then Why Doesn't
He Just Ask Me Out?

04:31.403 --> 04:33.307
He's Probably Scared.

04:33.339 --> 04:35.308
Of What?

04:35.341 --> 04:36.976
That You'll Say No.

04:37.009 --> 04:40.480
How Could Me Saying No
Be Scary?

04:40.512 --> 04:43.649
Rejection.
You Know, Humiliation.

04:43.682 --> 04:46.819
The Usual
Asking-People-Out Fears.

04:46.853 --> 04:48.722
I Don't See The Big Deal.

04:48.754 --> 04:50.356
Because Nothing Scares You.

04:50.389 --> 04:51.625
But You're Not Normal.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.994
And That's Just Gonna
Come Back To Haunt You.

04:54.026 --> 04:57.029
No Way.

04:57.062 --> 04:59.865
(Roars)

04:59.899 --> 05:01.067
What Was That?

05:01.100 --> 05:04.071
It's Probably Just A Cat.

05:04.103 --> 05:08.074
Or...
A Reanimated Corpse.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.043
Oh, My Gosh! There It Is!

05:10.076 --> 05:11.011
(Screams)

05:11.043 --> 05:13.045
(Chuckles)
Nope, My Bad.

05:13.079 --> 05:15.882
Just A Cat. Zombie Cat.
Feeds On Human Flesh.

05:15.915 --> 05:18.385
I Hate You. I Do.
I'm Not Kidding.

05:18.418 --> 05:19.920
(Chuckles) Gotcha.

05:24.757 --> 05:26.592
(Growls)

05:37.771 --> 05:40.741
That Was A Little
Too Close For Comfort.

05:40.774 --> 05:43.043
They Shouldn't Be Out
This Soon.

05:43.076 --> 05:46.112
This Is No Ordinary Halloween.

05:53.452 --> 05:55.421
Both: Happy Halloween.

05:58.425 --> 06:00.093
Morning. Love You.
Already Late.

06:00.125 --> 06:03.129
No, No, No, Not So Fast.
Breakfast First.

06:04.129 --> 06:05.798
Ew! What Is That?

06:05.831 --> 06:07.701
It's Garlic.
It's Good Prevention.

06:07.733 --> 06:09.870
Fights Off
So Many Nasty Things.

06:09.903 --> 06:13.673
Like... Anybody Within
Ten Feet Of My Breath?

06:13.706 --> 06:17.811
So Your Dad And I Are Gonna Be At
Our Annual Mycology Symposium

06:17.843 --> 06:20.646
At The Natural
History Museum Tonight.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.983
Why Is Halloween Such A Big
Night In The Mold Community?

06:24.016 --> 06:27.788
Why Not Have Your Symposium,
Like, November First?

06:27.821 --> 06:29.656
It's Just The Way It Is.

06:29.689 --> 06:34.494
So, Uh...
Ryan's Party's Tonight.

06:34.526 --> 06:36.962
And I Was Wondering
If I Could, Like,

06:36.995 --> 06:38.164
Have A Later Curfew?

06:38.197 --> 06:40.933
Your Dad And I
Were Thinking No Curfew.

06:40.966 --> 06:42.635
Really?

06:42.668 --> 06:44.637
Because It's Much Better
If You Don't Go Out At All.

06:44.670 --> 06:47.473
What? But It's Just
Right Down The Street.

06:47.507 --> 06:48.774
It's Not A Good Night.

06:48.807 --> 06:50.009
We Go Through This
Every Halloween.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.644
There's A Bad Element
Out There.

06:51.677 --> 06:53.713
What? Little Kids
Dressed As Pirates?

06:53.745 --> 06:57.049
Mom, I Have To Go
To Ryan's Party.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.186
Please! I Will Do
Anything For You!

06:59.218 --> 07:00.620
You'll Do Anything For Me?

07:00.653 --> 07:01.855
Anything!

07:01.887 --> 07:03.022
How About...

07:03.055 --> 07:05.125
Not Go To The Party?

07:05.158 --> 07:07.060
Ugh! Where's Dad?

07:07.093 --> 07:12.032
Skylar, Don't Go Down There!
You Know The Lab Is Off Limits!

07:12.064 --> 07:13.033
Dad...

07:13.065 --> 07:14.733
Yeah.

07:14.766 --> 07:16.802
Will You Please Tell Mom
She's Being Ridiculous?

07:16.836 --> 07:18.572
Oh, She Hates When
I Tell Her That, Honey.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.774
What's That?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.774
Uh, This Is Toxic Mold.

07:20.807 --> 07:24.878
Ooh, Exposure Causes
Severe Acne. You Wanna See?

07:24.911 --> 07:27.047
I Think I'll Pass. Thanks.

07:27.079 --> 07:29.048
That Is Your Loss.

07:29.081 --> 07:31.884
(Sighs) Dad, Can I Please
Go To Ryan's Party?

07:31.918 --> 07:32.886
Sure.

07:32.918 --> 07:34.221
Awesome! I Love You!

07:34.254 --> 07:35.254
Steve...

07:34.254 --> 07:35.254
Yeah, Hon.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.923
The Party's Tonight.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.158
Oh, Then, No,
You May Not Go To The Party.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.727
What?!

07:40.759 --> 07:42.062
The Thing Is, Sweetheart--

07:42.095 --> 07:44.030
Dad, Do Not Sweetheart Me!

07:44.062 --> 07:45.164
Precious--

07:45.197 --> 07:46.699
That's Worse Than Sweetheart!

07:46.733 --> 07:47.766
Look, When You're Older--

07:47.800 --> 07:48.802
How Much Older?

07:48.834 --> 07:50.202
Sixteen.

07:48.834 --> 07:50.202
Sixteen.

07:50.235 --> 07:52.072
But I'm Almost Sixteen!

07:52.105 --> 07:53.073
But Not Quite.

07:53.105 --> 07:54.608
Honey,
We Love You Very Much.

07:54.641 --> 07:55.775
This Is Not--

07:55.807 --> 07:58.110
Then Quit
Ruining My Life!

07:58.144 --> 08:00.079
Skylar, That's...

08:00.112 --> 08:01.081
Skylar, Honey.

08:01.113 --> 08:03.616
Ooh, Burn.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.251
Teenagers, Hmm?

08:05.285 --> 08:07.120
They Give You
Nothing But Trouble.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.688
How Would You Know?

08:08.721 --> 08:10.257
I Have A Cat.

08:12.257 --> 08:14.661
He's At A Very Difficult Age
Right Now.

08:15.728 --> 08:17.864
(Sighs)

08:17.896 --> 08:21.033
Sweetheart,
Maybe We Should Just Tell Her.

08:21.067 --> 08:24.071
We Got So Much
Going On Right Now.

08:29.007 --> 08:33.145
You, Uh, Remember
To Take Your Garlic?

08:33.178 --> 08:35.682
Honey, We Discussed That
Over And Over.

08:35.715 --> 08:38.051
Garlic Does Not
Repel Monsters, Okay?

08:38.082 --> 08:39.952
It's Superstitious Nonsense.

08:39.985 --> 08:42.154
So Are Monsters.

08:44.323 --> 08:45.525
Hmm.

08:46.826 --> 08:47.793
Here.

08:47.826 --> 08:49.796
She's Got A Point.

08:49.828 --> 08:51.096
Do You Take The Garlic?

08:51.129 --> 08:52.899
No, That's Ridiculous.

08:51.129 --> 08:52.899
Exactly.

08:56.336 --> 09:00.340
(Mechanical Whirring)

09:00.373 --> 09:04.210
Whoa. Okay, Look At That.
Full Apparition.

09:04.243 --> 09:07.013
We Picked Him Up Last Night.
It Wasn't Even Halloween Yet.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.181
(Growls)

09:08.214 --> 09:09.716
What's Going On
Out There, Steve?

09:09.749 --> 09:11.183
I Wish I Knew.

09:11.216 --> 09:13.052
That Was
A Rhetorical Question.

09:13.086 --> 09:16.089
It Was Kind Of
A Rhetorical Answer.

09:16.121 --> 09:20.059
(Bell Rings)

09:20.092 --> 09:23.129
(Indistinct Chatter)

09:29.635 --> 09:31.704
(Roars)

09:31.738 --> 09:34.708
Not In The Mood.

09:34.740 --> 09:38.177
Come On! You Can't Give Me
One Little... (Screams)?

09:38.211 --> 09:41.214
My Parents Are Making Me
Stay Home Tonight.

09:41.246 --> 09:43.782
Seriously? When Are They Gonna
Quit Treating You Like A Toddler?

09:43.816 --> 09:46.052
When I'm Sixteen.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.355
Because That's How Old You Have
To Be For The Convent To Take You?

09:48.388 --> 09:50.223
(Laughs) Totally.

09:50.255 --> 09:51.323
That Is So Lame.

09:51.356 --> 09:53.025
(Roars)

09:53.058 --> 09:54.059
(Screams)

09:54.092 --> 09:56.128
(Laughs)

09:56.162 --> 09:59.132
Dude, You Should
See Your Face!

10:04.003 --> 10:06.038
I Just Screamed To Be Polite.

10:06.072 --> 10:08.707
Wanted Him
To Feel Good About Himself.

10:08.740 --> 10:11.211
Ew.
I Think You Wet Your Pants.

10:11.244 --> 10:14.346
I Did Not! That's Not Funny!

10:14.379 --> 10:16.349
It's A Little Funny.

10:16.381 --> 10:19.251
(Bell Rings)

10:20.219 --> 10:22.022
The Amygdala
Is The Part Of The Brain

10:22.054 --> 10:24.156
That Orchestrates A Response
When Danger's Detected.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.026
You're Gonna Fry Your Brain
If You Don't Take A Break.

10:26.058 --> 10:27.860
Telling The Hypothalamus
To Initiate

10:27.894 --> 10:30.062
A Fight-Or-Flight Response
That Could Save Your Life.

10:30.096 --> 10:33.033
Stop Stressing Over Your Presentation.
You're Gonna Do Great.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.701
You Know How
I Fall Apart Under Pressure.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.336
When I Have To Get Up
In Front Of The Class,

10:36.369 --> 10:39.072
I Will Totally Freeze Up
And Look Like An Idiot.

10:39.105 --> 10:40.907
Just Don't Let It Scare You.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.010
Said The Girl
Who Knows No Fear.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.146
Hey, You Guys
Excited About Tonight?

10:46.178 --> 10:47.880
Can't Wait.

10:47.913 --> 10:49.948
Should Be A Blast.

10:49.981 --> 10:53.218
Her Parents
Are Super-Excited.

10:53.251 --> 10:57.222
Yeah, I Can't Believe My Dad Got Permission
For Us To Use Mcquarry Mansion.

10:57.255 --> 10:59.725
No One Ever Gets In There.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.794
No One Wants To.
I Mean, It's Creepy.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.462
Do You Think
It's Really Haunted?

11:03.495 --> 11:08.168
Who Knows? They Say
Old Man Mcquarry Lost His Mind.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.836
Shut Himself Up
In The House For Years.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.472
Ryan, We Really Need To Look
Over The Set List For Tonight.

11:13.505 --> 11:14.874
Okay.

11:14.907 --> 11:17.043
We're Rehearsing After School.

11:17.076 --> 11:18.411
Stop By If You Want.

11:18.443 --> 11:19.812
Wouldn't Miss It.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.148
(Chuckles)

11:26.284 --> 11:28.221
Don't Think I Don't See
What You're Doing Here.

11:28.254 --> 11:33.994
Stay Away From Ryan,
Or I Swear I Will Make Your Life Miserable.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.795
I Don't Know, Myra...

11:36.828 --> 11:38.964
I'm Pretty Sure
For That To Happen,

11:38.998 --> 11:41.168
I'd Have To Care
What You Think.

11:43.503 --> 11:46.206
(Sighs)

11:46.239 --> 11:49.209
I Can't Believe Ryan
Ever Went Out With Her.

11:49.241 --> 11:50.509
I Know. She's Scary.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.278
Ryan Should Have
His Amygdala Checked.

11:55.248 --> 11:58.118
Okay.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.853
We Have To Put
The Guitars Lower In The Mix.

12:00.886 --> 12:04.857
My Fans Need To Hear Me.
Oh, No!

12:04.890 --> 12:07.926
No, No, No, No, No, No. No.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.162
That Looks Awful!

12:09.195 --> 12:11.831
First Of All,
My Name Is Way Too Small.

12:11.864 --> 12:14.167
And Second, It's Crooked!

12:14.200 --> 12:17.836
Please Don't Make Me Ask The Janitor
For A Ladder Again. He Smells Like Feet.

12:17.870 --> 12:18.937
I'll Get Skylar.

12:18.971 --> 12:19.938
No!

12:19.971 --> 12:22.141
Just Give Me A Leg Up.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.044
You Know, Myra, Skylar's Had,
Like, Six Years Of Gymnastics.

12:26.077 --> 12:29.216
Just Give Me A Leg Up!

12:31.216 --> 12:32.351
Okay.

12:34.386 --> 12:36.388
(Grunts)

12:38.390 --> 12:41.360
(Cracking)

12:41.394 --> 12:42.528
Ready?

12:42.562 --> 12:43.863
A Little Left.

12:43.895 --> 12:46.532
More, More, More, More.

12:46.566 --> 12:49.235
Thank You.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.937
Don't Move.

12:54.907 --> 12:56.076
Okay.

12:58.510 --> 13:01.447
(Screams)

13:06.418 --> 13:07.788
Ow!

13:10.255 --> 13:12.259
(Indistinct Chatter)

13:24.269 --> 13:25.471
Oh.

13:25.504 --> 13:29.175
Oh, Look At The Dog.

13:25.504 --> 13:29.175
Oh, He's Cute.

13:29.207 --> 13:32.110
(Chuckles)
Look At You.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.179
Oh, Look At You.
You're So Cute.

13:34.212 --> 13:36.115
(Barks)

13:34.212 --> 13:36.115
Oh, You're So Cute.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.551
Are You Lost? Are You Lost,
You Lost Little Doggy?

13:38.583 --> 13:41.153
Are You Lost?
Are You Lost? Are You Lost?

13:41.187 --> 13:42.288
(Roars)

13:42.321 --> 13:44.290
(Screams)

13:44.322 --> 13:49.829
(All Scream)

13:51.496 --> 13:53.500
(Whimpers)

13:58.203 --> 13:59.638
He Was Practically Solid.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.542
And It's Not Even Sunset Yet.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.878
Cobb, We Got
Another One Coming In.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.345
I Don't Know
If We Can Handle Any More.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.214
The System's Running Pretty Hot.

14:08.246 --> 14:10.216
Tell Him To Bring
The Backup Generator Online.

14:10.249 --> 14:12.018
Bring
The Backup Generator Online.

14:12.051 --> 14:13.953
I'll Try.

14:13.985 --> 14:17.256
I Know That. This Is Not
My First Rodeo, Babe.

14:17.289 --> 14:20.926
Oh, You're So Cute
When You're Testy.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.229
Yee-Haw!

14:31.202 --> 14:32.504
(Screams)

14:32.538 --> 14:34.173
I Hate Halloween!

14:34.206 --> 14:36.209
Â™ªâ™ª

14:41.714 --> 14:45.318
â™ª I Can Feel You Coming
From A Mile Away â™ª

14:45.350 --> 14:49.154
â™ª My Pulse Starts Racing
From The Words That You Say â™ª

14:49.187 --> 14:53.025
â™ª And You Say So Many Of Them
Like You Don't Have A Clue â™ª

14:53.058 --> 14:56.261
â™ª That I'm Signed, Sealed,
Delivered With A Stamp On â™ª

14:56.294 --> 14:59.998
â™ª You Don't Have
To Try Too Hard â™ª

15:00.032 --> 15:04.103
â™ª You Already Have My Heart â™ª

15:04.135 --> 15:07.706
â™ª You Don't Got
A Thing To Prove â™ª

15:07.740 --> 15:09.274
â™ª I'm Already Into You â™ª

15:09.307 --> 15:11.311
(Groans)

15:11.344 --> 15:13.212
â™ª So... â™ª

15:13.245 --> 15:17.549
â™ª Hold, Hold, Hold,
Hold Me Tight Now â™ª

15:17.582 --> 15:21.553
â™ª 'Cause I'm So,
So Good To Go â™ª

15:21.586 --> 15:25.091
â™ª Don't Say,
Don't Say Good Night â™ª

15:25.124 --> 15:29.461
â™ª You Know
You Had Me At Hello â™ª

15:30.462 --> 15:34.266
â™ª You Had Me At Hello â™ª

15:34.299 --> 15:37.569
â™ª You Had Me At Hello â™ª

15:37.602 --> 15:40.706
â™ª Don't Say,
Don't Say Good Night â™ª

15:40.740 --> 15:45.544
â™ª You Know
You Had Me At Hello â™ª

15:45.577 --> 15:49.281
â™ª Close Your Mouth Now,
Baby, Don't Say A Word â™ª

15:49.315 --> 15:50.984
All Right, Cut.

15:52.784 --> 15:54.453
(Sighs)

15:57.056 --> 15:59.225
I Know. Terrible, Huh?

15:59.258 --> 16:03.296
Not At All. I Just Haven't
Heard You Sing In Forever.

16:03.328 --> 16:06.164
Well, I Hate My Voice.

16:06.197 --> 16:08.201
I Don't Know
What We're Gonna Do.

16:08.234 --> 16:11.304
Well, Where's Myra?

16:11.336 --> 16:12.471
(Muffled)
Right Here.

16:12.504 --> 16:15.540
Oh, My Gosh!
What Happened?

16:15.573 --> 16:19.745
(Indistinct)

16:24.350 --> 16:26.152
She Fell.

16:26.184 --> 16:28.153
So Now We Have
No Lead Singer For Tonight.

16:28.187 --> 16:32.392
(Muffled)
I'm Totally Irreplaceable.

16:32.424 --> 16:36.094
That's A Great Idea!
You Could Sing With Us!

16:36.128 --> 16:37.463
You Know The Songs.

16:37.495 --> 16:39.031
Me?

16:39.065 --> 16:40.800
(Muffled) Her?! Ow!

16:40.832 --> 16:42.334
Yeah, You've Got
An Amazing Voice.

16:42.368 --> 16:43.669
You'd Be Great.

16:43.701 --> 16:47.173
You See, The Thing Is,
My Parents Kind Of--

16:47.206 --> 16:52.379
Please, Sky, I Need You.

16:54.712 --> 16:56.682
What The Heck. Sounds Like Fun.

16:56.715 --> 17:00.253
Awesome! Okay, If You Start
To Feel Stage Fright At All--

17:00.285 --> 17:02.587
Well, Why Would I?

17:02.620 --> 17:05.391
I Don't Know. You Know,
Standing Up On Stage In Front Of All Those People,

17:05.423 --> 17:09.261
Everyone Staring Back At You...
It's Terrifying.

17:09.295 --> 17:11.798
You Don't Look Terrified
When You're Up There.

17:11.829 --> 17:14.800
You Joking? I'm Freaking Out.

17:14.834 --> 17:20.105
I Just Try To Get Lost
In The Music. It Helps.

17:20.137 --> 17:25.242
Well, If It Happens,
I'll Try That.

17:25.277 --> 17:27.279
Oh, If You Get In Trouble,

17:27.313 --> 17:32.151
Just Look Over To Me--
We'll Sing It Together.

17:32.183 --> 17:33.385
(Growls)

17:33.419 --> 17:39.826
Well, I Better Go Figure Out--
I Mean, Get Ready.

17:39.858 --> 17:41.259
Don't Be Late.

17:39.858 --> 17:41.259
Okay.

17:41.292 --> 17:43.328
We're Counting On You.

17:41.292 --> 17:43.328
See You Later.

17:43.362 --> 17:46.298
Replacing You With Skylar,

17:46.332 --> 17:49.368
That Was A Fantastic Idea.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.237
(Indistinct)

17:51.269 --> 17:53.239
Ow!

17:53.271 --> 17:55.274
(Whimpers)

18:02.381 --> 18:05.384
(Door Opens And Closes)

18:11.190 --> 18:15.495
Cobb, Something Strange
Is Going On.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.829
There's Ten Times
The Activity Out There.

18:17.863 --> 18:20.199
It's Like They're
Being Drawn To Fairview.

18:20.231 --> 18:22.335
Not Only That,
The Amount Of Power The Tank's Draining

18:22.367 --> 18:25.871
Is Way Out Of Line With The Plasma
Levels On The Ones You Just Brought In.

18:25.904 --> 18:30.276
I Thing It's Got Something
To Do With Our Guest Of Honor.

18:39.351 --> 18:40.487
(Growls)

18:43.221 --> 18:45.525
Listen, I'm Gonna Need You To
Keep An Eye On Skylar Tonight.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.527
It's Really Dangerous
For Her Out There.

18:47.559 --> 18:49.327
Make Sure That
She Does Not Leave The House.

18:49.361 --> 18:51.297
No Problem.

18:51.329 --> 18:55.300
Of Course,
You Realize I Charge 15 An Hour For Babysitting.

18:55.334 --> 18:58.304
Or Nothing. Whatever You're
Comfortable With.

18:58.336 --> 19:00.873
I Think
Nothing Is Better For Me.

19:00.905 --> 19:04.309
Great. Yeah, Let's Do That.
Let's Do Nothing.

19:04.343 --> 19:05.411
Oh, No.

19:05.443 --> 19:06.412
What?

19:06.444 --> 19:08.246
I Got More Readings Already.

19:08.279 --> 19:09.248
Really?

19:09.280 --> 19:10.282
Yeah.

19:12.218 --> 19:15.521
Well, The Good News Is,
Is I'm The Babysitter.

19:15.554 --> 19:20.894
(Beeping)

19:25.230 --> 19:28.233
So There's No Way I Can Go?
That's Your Final Decision?

19:28.267 --> 19:30.236
I Am Afraid So, Sweetheart.

19:30.269 --> 19:33.239
(Sighs) Okay, Fine.

19:33.271 --> 19:34.874
You're Not Planning
On Sneaking Out, Are You?

19:34.906 --> 19:36.908
Of Course Not.

19:36.942 --> 19:40.880
That Would Be, Like, As Childish As Your
Making Me Stay Home On Halloween.

19:40.913 --> 19:44.250
Julie, We Got Two More Monst--
"Monstops"--Monsters--

19:44.282 --> 19:47.385
Stops To Make Before
The Big Symposium Tonight.

19:47.419 --> 19:49.689
So, You Know, We Should, Uh--

19:47.419 --> 19:49.689
We Should Go.

19:49.721 --> 19:50.990
Yeah.

19:49.721 --> 19:50.990
Yeah.

19:51.022 --> 19:52.991
Good Night,
Sweetheart.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.694
Bye, Honey.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.862
(Sighs) Have Fun.

19:56.894 --> 19:59.598
Hey. Ready To Hang
With Uncle Cobb?

19:59.632 --> 20:03.936
Play Some Classic Board Games?
Maybe A Little Go Fish?

20:03.969 --> 20:06.305
You Did Not Get Me A Babysitter.

20:06.337 --> 20:08.707
Whoa, Not A Babysitter.
A Teen Social Companion.

20:08.740 --> 20:10.742
You're Welcome.

20:10.776 --> 20:13.613
Right, So I'll Just Set The Alarm
So You're Nice And Safe Inside.

20:13.645 --> 20:16.414
An Alarm? Seriously?

20:16.448 --> 20:18.751
Oh, Sweetheart, You Won't Even Notice It's There,
Unless You Try To Go Outside.

20:18.784 --> 20:22.421
Yeah, We Love You, Have A Great Time Tonight,
And Don't Open Any Doors Or Windows.

20:22.453 --> 20:23.822
Do Not Do That.

20:23.855 --> 20:26.526
Guys, I'm Almost 16!

20:28.460 --> 20:30.429
I Feel Terrible About This.

20:30.461 --> 20:32.265
Honey, Do You Want Her
Out On The Streets?

20:32.298 --> 20:34.532
With Your Family's Blood In Her
Veins And No Clue What She Is?

20:34.566 --> 20:37.370
We Should've Told Her.
We Should've Started The Training Early.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.305
Maybe, But It's Too Late.

20:39.337 --> 20:41.339
I Don't Actually
Have The Code For That,

20:41.373 --> 20:43.808
So If You Want To Have
Any Friends Over,

20:43.842 --> 20:46.746
They Kinda Need To Be
Inside The House Already.

20:46.778 --> 20:50.915
I'll Be In My Room,
Hating My Life.

20:50.949 --> 20:54.920
Without Training She Wouldn't Be A Monster Hunter,
She'd Be Monster Hunted.

20:54.952 --> 20:57.589
Honey, It's For Her Own Good.

20:57.623 --> 20:59.057
Should've Made Her
Take More Garlic.

20:59.090 --> 21:01.493
Oh, Please Don't Start
With The Garlic Again.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.328
Studies Are Extremely--

21:03.362 --> 21:06.332
Studies Are Boring.

21:03.362 --> 21:06.332
No, They're Not Boring.

21:06.365 --> 21:08.601
Did You Tune This Thing?

21:27.051 --> 21:30.488
Wait, What?
They Locked You In!?

21:30.521 --> 21:32.325
Meet Me In Front Of My House
In Ten Minutes.

21:32.357 --> 21:34.460
Wait, What Are You Gonna Do?

21:34.492 --> 21:36.394
<I>Duh. I'm Cutting The Power.

21:36.428 --> 21:38.964
I'm Gonna Break Out.

21:38.997 --> 21:40.400
(Grunts)

21:42.101 --> 21:43.603
She Scares Me.

21:46.605 --> 21:50.309
Wow. Ow.

21:51.943 --> 21:56.048
You Know, This Would Be A Lot
More Fun With The Two Of Us.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.549
Maybe Later.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.552
Where Are You Going?

21:59.585 --> 22:02.555
Just Doing Some Laundry.

22:02.587 --> 22:05.957
There's No Laundry Down...

22:08.093 --> 22:10.396
I Was Winning!

22:10.429 --> 22:15.034
Might As Well
Turn Them All Off.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.102
Don't Cut The Power!

22:16.134 --> 22:18.337
(Alarm Sounds)

22:19.471 --> 22:23.075
Oh, No, No, No, No, No.
No, No, No, No, No.

22:23.107 --> 22:25.911
No, No, No, No, No, No, No!
Stay There! Stay There! No!

22:25.943 --> 22:28.947
Stay Back!

22:25.943 --> 22:28.947
Cobb!

22:28.980 --> 22:31.083
(Grunting) Just Stay There!

22:31.115 --> 22:33.385
What Is That?

22:33.419 --> 22:35.755
Turn Them Back On!

22:35.788 --> 22:38.891
(Screams) Run!

22:38.923 --> 22:43.061
Cobb!

22:38.923 --> 22:43.061
Oh, I Gotta Get Skylar!

22:43.095 --> 22:44.864
I Gotta Get Skylar!
Come On!

22:44.896 --> 22:46.731
(Screams)

22:44.896 --> 22:46.731
Come On!

22:46.765 --> 22:51.737
(Screaming)

22:51.769 --> 22:54.773
Go, Go, Go! Hurry!

23:08.519 --> 23:11.022
(Roaring)

23:17.028 --> 23:21.800
(Laughing)

23:21.834 --> 23:26.772
Hello, World, Mommy's Home!

23:26.805 --> 23:29.074
That's Not Mold!

23:29.106 --> 23:31.644
No, It Isn't.

23:31.676 --> 23:34.145
(Both Gasp)

23:34.179 --> 23:36.949
Hmm...

23:36.981 --> 23:40.085
Maybe I'll Just Meet
You Guys At The Party.

23:40.117 --> 23:43.888
No, We Have To Stay
With Skylar. Come On.

23:43.922 --> 23:49.562
(Whimpering)

23:49.595 --> 23:51.831
Where Are The Hunters?!

23:51.864 --> 23:53.164
(All Scream)

23:53.198 --> 23:54.200
I Just Work Here!
I Don't...

23:54.232 --> 23:55.967
Please Don't Hurt Us!

23:56.999 --> 23:58.103
(Laughs)
Don't Worry, Dear.

23:58.135 --> 24:00.839
There'll Be
Plenty Of Time For That.

24:00.873 --> 24:05.009
(Grunts)

24:05.042 --> 24:07.011
(All Scream)

24:07.045 --> 24:08.514
That Is So Intense!

24:08.547 --> 24:10.516
(Laughs)

24:10.548 --> 24:12.750
Now That's What I Like To Hear.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.019
(Laughs)

24:14.051 --> 24:19.759
Theodosia! Bob! Come To Me!

24:22.260 --> 24:25.064
You're Both Looking Well.

24:25.096 --> 24:27.066
Whose Fear Have You
Been Feeding On?

24:27.098 --> 24:28.900
Theirs!

24:27.098 --> 24:28.900
Theirs!

24:28.933 --> 24:30.635
(All Scream)

24:30.669 --> 24:33.906
Look At Them Cower!
They Must Be Delicious!

24:33.939 --> 24:35.207
(Laughs)

24:35.240 --> 24:40.913
Anyway, Come,
Let's Go Hunt The Hunters.

24:40.945 --> 24:43.882
Oh, Don't Fret, Dear.
I'll Be Back Soon...

24:43.915 --> 24:48.721
For Eternity! (Laughs)

24:48.753 --> 24:51.890
Cobb, What's Happening?!

24:51.923 --> 24:54.192
Uh, It's Kind Of A Long Story.

24:54.226 --> 24:56.562
Well, Can You Sum It Up?

24:56.595 --> 24:59.565
The Bad Lady's Immortal And
Wants To Destroy Your Parents

24:59.597 --> 25:05.238
And Possess Your Soul
For All Eternity, But, Hey...

25:11.775 --> 25:16.113
Whoa! You Have No Idea
How Good It Feels To Be Out!

25:16.147 --> 25:19.117
Fifteen Years Crumpled Up
In A Little Ball.

25:19.149 --> 25:21.084
Never Know It
To Look At You.

25:21.118 --> 25:23.388
You're Positively Exquisite.

25:23.420 --> 25:26.056
Yeah, You've Been
Working Out, Huh?

25:26.090 --> 25:27.891
I've Been Stuck
In A Tank, You Idiot!

25:27.925 --> 25:29.193
Oh, My Bad.

25:29.225 --> 25:31.361
So Much Catching Up To Do.

25:31.395 --> 25:34.732
How's The Fear Business?
Stephen King Still Writing?

25:34.764 --> 25:38.869
Yes, But His Last Novel
Was Historical Fiction.

25:38.903 --> 25:40.438
Scary Historical Fiction?

25:40.471 --> 25:42.707
Not Particularly.

25:42.740 --> 25:45.877
Hmm. What About Horror Movies?
Still Big With The Kids?

25:45.909 --> 25:49.746
No, It's All Gross-Out Comedies Now,
But Vampires Are In.

25:49.780 --> 25:52.950
Ooh. Well, That's Promising.

25:52.983 --> 25:57.187
Except They're Romantic Vampires Who Fall In Love.

25:57.221 --> 25:58.990
Yuck!

25:59.023 --> 26:02.060
We've Got Work To Do.

26:02.092 --> 26:03.326
"Been Working Out"?

26:03.359 --> 26:06.129
Your Brain
Is Made Of Straw.

26:06.163 --> 26:09.300
Well, Surprise.
So Is The Rest Of Me.

26:09.332 --> 26:12.969
(Laughing)

26:13.003 --> 26:15.840
(Screaming)

26:19.909 --> 26:21.244
(Screaming)

26:21.278 --> 26:23.281
Don't Worry,
It's Just A Costume.

26:23.313 --> 26:27.317
(Screaming)
A Really Good Costume!

26:28.819 --> 26:32.990
(Groans)

26:33.023 --> 26:35.426
(Whirring)

26:35.458 --> 26:37.961
(Groaning)

26:37.994 --> 26:41.364
(Panting)

26:41.398 --> 26:44.334
Steve, Take A Look At This.

26:44.368 --> 26:47.271
I Haven't Seen
A Plasma Signature Like That

26:47.303 --> 26:48.939
In 15 Years.

26:48.973 --> 26:50.273
It Can't Be.

26:50.307 --> 26:52.777
(Roaring)

26:52.810 --> 26:55.113
Get Back In The Van.

26:52.810 --> 26:55.113
Okay.

26:55.146 --> 26:57.815
Wanna Shut The Door, Maybe?

26:55.146 --> 26:57.815
I'm Driving! You Get The Door!

26:57.848 --> 27:02.253
How About You Do The Car And I Do The Equipment?
That's How It's Always Been!

27:02.285 --> 27:03.387
(Grunts)

27:03.419 --> 27:06.923
(Engine Sputtering)

27:03.419 --> 27:06.923
Come On, Baby.

27:06.956 --> 27:11.262
I Just Want You To Know Right Now
That I Have Everything I Put Together.

27:11.294 --> 27:14.931
And You--I Mean, You're The Man.
You're Supposed To Shut The Door.

27:14.965 --> 27:17.033
(Continue Arguing)

27:17.067 --> 27:20.037
(Panting)

27:20.070 --> 27:24.041
My Parents Are Monster Hunters?

27:24.073 --> 27:26.510
(Screams)

27:26.543 --> 27:30.013
Fourth Generation.
Best In The Business.

27:30.046 --> 27:32.082
That's Why
I'm Training With Them.

27:32.116 --> 27:35.552
Wait. My Parents?
Steve And Julie?

27:35.586 --> 27:38.089
Nerdy, Overprotective?
Way Into Mold?

27:38.121 --> 27:40.257
Mold's A Day Job.
It Pays The Bills.

27:40.291 --> 27:42.793
Monster Hunting
Isn't Really Money, Money.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.929
It's More Like
Volunteer Work.

27:44.962 --> 27:47.165
Like Helping Out
In A Soup Kitchen?

27:47.197 --> 27:51.168
Yes, Sadie, Like Helping Out
At A Monster Soup Kitchen.

27:51.202 --> 27:53.204
(Phone Vibrates)

27:51.202 --> 27:53.204
(Screams)

27:53.236 --> 27:54.538
Oh, That's My Phone.

27:54.571 --> 27:57.241
(Screams)
It's Your Parents.

27:57.273 --> 27:59.510
(Sighs)

27:59.542 --> 28:02.146
Hello? (Chuckles)

28:02.178 --> 28:04.181
Cobb, What Happened?

28:04.215 --> 28:06.317
Oh, You Know,
We Were Just Hanging Out,

28:06.350 --> 28:10.120
And We Lost Power
In The Containment Unit.

28:10.154 --> 28:11.422
What?

28:11.455 --> 28:14.258
And Deimata's Loose.

28:14.291 --> 28:17.094
<I>And Then You Guys
Ran Out Of Soda, Which Is--

28:17.127 --> 28:18.196
Is Skylar Okay?

28:18.228 --> 28:20.230
She's Fine...

28:20.263 --> 28:23.834
Other Than The Fifteen Years' Worth
Of Fear Coursing Through Her.

28:28.339 --> 28:30.273
Your Mom
Wants To Talk To You.

28:30.307 --> 28:31.309
Mommy?

28:31.341 --> 28:33.109
Skylar, Honey,
Are You All Right?

28:33.142 --> 28:34.878
I'm Fine...

28:34.911 --> 28:40.450
Except You Left Me With Cobb
And He's Kinda Flipped Out.

28:40.484 --> 28:42.419
No, No, He's Not Flipping Out.
He's Telling You The Truth.

28:42.453 --> 28:45.356
Now I Want You To Listen
To Him Very Carefully

28:45.388 --> 28:48.258
<I>And You Do Whatever
He Tells You To Do.

28:48.292 --> 28:50.127
(Screams)

28:50.159 --> 28:52.028
(Laughs)

28:52.061 --> 28:53.598
Skylar?

28:52.061 --> 28:53.598
Skylar?

28:53.630 --> 28:56.967
Mom? Mommy?

28:57.001 --> 28:58.235
Skylar?

28:59.602 --> 29:03.173
Hello?

29:03.206 --> 29:05.008
The Line Went Dead.

29:05.042 --> 29:06.343
That's Great.

29:06.377 --> 29:08.346
Skylar's In Danger.
We Need To Stop Deimata.

29:08.378 --> 29:11.248
Don't Worry, We Will.

29:11.282 --> 29:13.551
Deimata: Theodosia! Bob!

29:13.583 --> 29:15.253
Bob: Let The Fun Begin!

29:15.285 --> 29:17.487
(All Laugh)

29:17.521 --> 29:22.225
When You Said,
"The Bad Lady Wants To Possess Skylar's Soul..."

29:22.259 --> 29:24.362
This Isn't Happening.

29:24.395 --> 29:26.263
You Were Talking
Figuratively, Right?

29:26.296 --> 29:28.431
No, Literally.

29:28.465 --> 29:33.070
So If You Two Could Help Make
Sure That Skylar Doesn't...

29:33.102 --> 29:34.504
Wander Off Alone!

29:34.538 --> 29:35.506
Where Are You? Go!

29:35.539 --> 29:37.208
(All Scream)

29:37.241 --> 29:40.077
La La La La La La La La La
La La La La La La La La La.

29:40.109 --> 29:42.647
Oh! Let Me Go! Get Off Me!

29:42.679 --> 29:47.183
Where Are You Going?
There's A Monster Hunting You.

29:47.216 --> 29:49.320
This Isn't Real.
It's All A Dream.

29:49.352 --> 29:51.488
I'm Going To Ryan's Party And
At Some Point I Will Wake Up.

29:51.522 --> 29:53.189
Skylar, You Need
To Listen To Me.

29:53.223 --> 29:54.325
La La La La La La La La La.

29:54.358 --> 29:56.193
Cut It Out.

29:56.225 --> 29:58.495
Sadie, Something's
Very Wrong With Me.

29:58.529 --> 30:01.499
I Mean, My Heart's Racing
And My Palms Are Sweaty

30:01.532 --> 30:03.134
And My Stomach Feels Funny.

30:03.167 --> 30:05.269
That's Fear.
I Get That, Like, Every Day.

30:05.301 --> 30:06.603
Sometimes Twice.

30:06.637 --> 30:08.339
Like In The Locker Room
After Gym.

30:10.139 --> 30:12.542
I Get It More With Tests...

30:12.576 --> 30:17.181
Homework, Talking To Guys
And Girls And Teachers

30:17.214 --> 30:18.381
And, Uh, Store Clerks
And My Parents--

30:18.415 --> 30:20.384
Well, I Don't Get It Ever.

30:20.417 --> 30:23.186
Why Am I Feeling This?

30:23.219 --> 30:25.388
Because Deimata's Loose.

30:25.421 --> 30:28.225
The Monsters Are Astral Projections Of Human Fear.

30:28.257 --> 30:30.260
Most Of The Time,
We Only See Them In Dreams.

30:30.293 --> 30:32.429
Every Night.

30:30.293 --> 30:32.429
Sometimes Twice.

30:32.463 --> 30:36.233
But When There's Enough Fear In The Air,
Like On Halloween,

30:36.265 --> 30:39.235
They Get Strong Enough
To Take Physical Form.

30:39.269 --> 30:44.308
And It's Up To The Monster Hunters
To Make Sure They Don't Take Over.

30:44.340 --> 30:46.377
What Do You Mean, "Take Over?"

30:46.409 --> 30:48.079
Each Monster Attaches Itself
To One Person,

30:48.111 --> 30:49.580
Usually
For Their Whole Lives,

30:49.612 --> 30:51.548
And If That Person's Fear
Gets Too Out Of Control,

30:51.581 --> 30:53.617
The Monster
Takes Them Over Completely.

30:53.649 --> 30:57.321
So Who's This Deimata?

30:57.353 --> 30:59.256
She's Your Monster.

31:01.157 --> 31:02.560
La La La La La La La La La La.

31:02.592 --> 31:04.561
And Deimata's
One Of The Ancient Ones.

31:04.594 --> 31:06.763
They're Immortal,
They Can't Be Destroyed.

31:06.796 --> 31:10.166
And They Always Latch Onto The
Strongest Host That They Can Find...

31:10.199 --> 31:12.369
Like Your Grandfather.

31:12.403 --> 31:14.372
My Grandfather?

31:14.405 --> 31:16.674
He Passed On
Right Before I Was Born.

31:16.706 --> 31:18.676
Cobb: <I>Your Grandfather
Was A Monster Hunter Himself,

31:18.708 --> 31:20.311
<I>So For Most His Life,

31:20.343 --> 31:23.346
<I>He Kept Deimata
From Growing Too Powerful.

31:23.379 --> 31:25.315
<I>But In The End,
She Was Too Much For Him.

31:25.349 --> 31:27.618
(Laughs)

31:27.650 --> 31:30.253
<I>Then Deimata Went Looking
For A New Host--You.

31:30.286 --> 31:33.256
Hello, Baby Skylar.

31:33.290 --> 31:35.792
(Crying)

31:35.826 --> 31:37.194
Get Away From Her!

31:37.226 --> 31:40.230
Or What? (Laughs)

31:41.197 --> 31:43.266
(Crying)

31:43.300 --> 31:46.236
Monster Hunting
Was In Your Mom's Blood.

31:46.270 --> 31:48.506
And To Help Protect You,
Your Dad Became One, Too.

31:48.539 --> 31:51.342
So He Converted?

31:51.375 --> 31:53.377
It Was No Problem.
They Were Reform.

31:53.409 --> 31:55.378
Being Scientists Already,

31:55.411 --> 31:57.380
They Modified Your Grandfather's
Old Weapons

31:57.414 --> 31:59.450
<I>And Achieved Something No One
Had Ever Thought Possible...

31:59.483 --> 32:01.217
That'll Do.

32:01.251 --> 32:04.355
They Found A Way To Capture
One Of The Ancient Ones.

32:04.388 --> 32:06.389
<I>With Your Monster Sealed Away,

32:06.423 --> 32:08.259
<I>You Grew Up Without
Any Sense Of Fear At All.

32:08.292 --> 32:10.727
<I>Now It's All
Coming Back At Once.

32:13.296 --> 32:17.834
Wow, Interesting...
And Totally Impossible. Bye!

32:17.868 --> 32:20.671
How Come Her Parents
Kept All This A Secret?

32:20.704 --> 32:23.474
All What? It's Not True!

32:23.506 --> 32:26.276
Monster Hunting's Passed Down
Through Families.

32:26.310 --> 32:29.113
Traditionally, Parents Wait Until Their
Kids Are 16 Before They Tell Them,

32:29.146 --> 32:30.648
To Give Them
A Normal Childhood.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.484
Speaking Of Normal,
Which This Is Not,

32:33.516 --> 32:35.385
I'm Going To Ryan's Party.

32:35.418 --> 32:36.586
Sky, There's A Monster
After You!

32:36.619 --> 32:37.754
(Scoffs)

32:37.788 --> 32:39.557
Going To The Party
Is A Good Idea.

32:39.590 --> 32:42.393
If Deimata Comes Back Here,
You'll Be Better Off Over There.

32:42.426 --> 32:44.195
But You Need Some Firepower.

32:44.227 --> 32:45.662
Firepower?

32:45.696 --> 32:47.231
Yes.

32:54.605 --> 32:57.308
Holy Paintball!

32:57.340 --> 32:59.443
A Blaster Will Slow Them Down.

32:59.475 --> 33:02.646
A Stun Gun Will Really
Ring Their Bells.

33:02.678 --> 33:05.815
But To Capture Them,
We Have To Use These Puppies.

33:05.849 --> 33:07.283
Molecular Atomizer--

33:07.317 --> 33:09.253
Reduces A Monster
Back To Its Vapor State.

33:09.285 --> 33:12.288
Oh, I've Totally Used Those!

33:12.321 --> 33:14.358
In Video Games.

33:15.425 --> 33:17.394
Pcu--
Portable Containment Unit.

33:17.426 --> 33:19.396
Traps Them Until You Can
Get Them Back Here

33:19.428 --> 33:21.197
And Unload Into The Tank.

33:21.231 --> 33:22.633
Which I Have
To Stay Here And Fix,

33:22.666 --> 33:25.202
Because Without The Tank,
We're Doomed.

33:25.234 --> 33:27.204
You're Not Coming With Us?

33:27.236 --> 33:30.840
Blah, Blah, Blah.
Can We--Can We Go Now?

33:30.873 --> 33:32.475
Why Is She Acting Like This?

33:32.509 --> 33:34.678
She's Never
Experienced Fear Before,

33:34.711 --> 33:36.313
Let Alone This Much.

33:36.346 --> 33:38.682
Denial's A Very Common Reaction.

33:38.715 --> 33:41.217
If You're Not Coming With Us,
We're Staying Here.

33:41.251 --> 33:43.787
You Have To Go And Make Sure
Skylar Gets To The Party Safely.

33:43.820 --> 33:48.658
Here, Will Keep An Eye On You
With The Helmet Cam.

33:48.692 --> 33:50.227
(Chuckles)

33:50.260 --> 33:53.597
The Thing Is,
I'm Actually Going Home Now

33:53.629 --> 33:55.599
To Hide Under A Bed, So--

33:53.629 --> 33:55.599
No, You're Not.

33:55.631 --> 33:58.635
This Is Skylar
And She's In Danger.

33:58.668 --> 34:00.403
And Let's Quit Talking
And Just Do This

34:00.436 --> 34:02.505
Before I Have To Go
Breathe In A Paper Bag.

34:02.539 --> 34:05.709
Guys, Seriously,
I'm Out Of Here.

34:05.742 --> 34:07.211
Not Without Your Equipment.

34:07.244 --> 34:08.545
No Way!

34:08.578 --> 34:10.547
Way. It's Halloween--
You Can Tell People

34:10.581 --> 34:12.550
You're Going As Your Favorite
Steampunk Character.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.552
I Don't Even
Know What That Is.

34:14.585 --> 34:17.554
Because Your Generation Has No
Taste In Speculative Science Fiction.

34:17.587 --> 34:21.558
I Am The Babysitter.
You Are The Baby That Sits.

34:21.592 --> 34:23.561
Don't Argue With Me.

34:23.594 --> 34:24.795
Fine.

34:27.264 --> 34:28.666
I'll Take The Little One.

34:28.699 --> 34:30.668
Take This, Too.

34:30.701 --> 34:32.670
And This.

34:32.703 --> 34:35.406
Definitely This.

34:35.438 --> 34:37.373
This Wouldn't Hurt.

34:37.406 --> 34:38.542
No.

34:38.574 --> 34:41.444
Okay, Sorry.
That Is A Little Too Much.

34:44.281 --> 34:45.248
They're Here.

34:45.281 --> 34:46.882
You Think It's A Trap?

34:46.917 --> 34:48.284
Definitely.

34:48.317 --> 34:49.520
You Wanna Go Spring It?

34:49.552 --> 34:51.554
Absolutely.

34:51.587 --> 34:52.554
Am...

34:52.589 --> 34:53.757
Am I Going First?

34:53.790 --> 34:54.992
You Sure Are.

34:55.025 --> 34:56.393
Oh, Yeah.
All Right. Okay.

34:56.426 --> 34:58.362
Well--

34:56.426 --> 34:58.362
All Right, All Right.

35:00.330 --> 35:03.567
Hurry Up! The Party's Started!

35:03.600 --> 35:08.505
Remember, I'm Following You
On The Helmet Cam. Okay?

35:11.942 --> 35:14.311
You'll Be Perfectly Safe...

35:14.344 --> 35:15.580
I Think.

35:16.779 --> 35:18.348
Honey, It's Mostly A Placebo.

35:18.382 --> 35:19.583
It Is Not A Placebo.

35:19.616 --> 35:21.418
There Have Been Multiple
Double-Blind Studies.

35:21.451 --> 35:23.821
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah,
Financed By The Garlic Industry.

35:23.853 --> 35:25.422
When Was The Last Time
I Was Sick?

35:25.455 --> 35:27.257
I Don't Know.

35:25.455 --> 35:27.257
When Was The Last Time I Was--

35:27.290 --> 35:28.658
Deimata:
I Got A Surprise For You!

35:28.692 --> 35:29.893
Skylar: Mom! Dad! Help!

35:29.926 --> 35:31.929
Skylar!

35:34.331 --> 35:35.499
Skylar!

35:35.531 --> 35:37.333
(Deimata Laughs)

35:37.366 --> 35:40.370
Skylar: Mom! Dad!
Where Are You?! Hurry!

35:40.404 --> 35:42.606
Skylar!

35:42.639 --> 35:44.875
Skylar: Up Here!

35:46.375 --> 35:48.812
Skylar: Mom! Dad! (Screams)

35:57.353 --> 36:00.323
Skylar: Mom! Dad! Help! Help!

36:00.357 --> 36:04.027
Help! (Laughs)

36:04.060 --> 36:07.831
(All Laugh)

36:09.433 --> 36:13.570
(Laughs)

36:13.603 --> 36:14.839
(Laughs)

36:24.514 --> 36:26.517
(Laughs)

36:30.920 --> 36:33.857
(Laughs)

36:38.561 --> 36:41.964
Parents--
They're So Easily Duped.

36:41.998 --> 36:44.001
(Laughs)

36:47.670 --> 36:52.042
Sadie: One Of The Monsters That Was With Deimata,
I've Seen Her Before.

36:52.074 --> 36:54.477
Henry: The Witch?

36:54.511 --> 36:57.348
Yeah, I Used To Call Her
The Schoolmarm.

36:57.380 --> 36:59.750
When She First Showed Up,
I Was In A Spelling Bee,

36:59.782 --> 37:03.052
And I Got So Scared
I Misspelled "Goat."

37:03.085 --> 37:06.889
That's Pretty Hard
To Misspell.

37:06.922 --> 37:10.893
After That, She'd Show Up Whenever
I Had Something Important At School.

37:10.927 --> 37:14.865
Even When I Can't See Her,
I Can Sense Her,

37:14.897 --> 37:16.866
Mocking Me Like She
Knows I'm Going To Fail,

37:16.900 --> 37:20.070
And Then--
And Then I Do.

37:20.103 --> 37:21.705
I've Seen The Other One.

37:21.737 --> 37:22.906
The Scarecrow?

37:22.938 --> 37:24.741
He Lives In The Woods
Behind My House.

37:24.775 --> 37:26.577
The Other Kids
Used To Make Fun Of Me

37:26.610 --> 37:28.912
Because I Was Too Scared
To Play In Them.

37:28.944 --> 37:31.748
When I Got Older,
I'd See Him Everywhere.

37:31.781 --> 37:35.151
It's Like You Said-- Even When I Can't See Him,
I Know He's There.

37:35.185 --> 37:37.121
All I Can Do Is Run.

37:37.154 --> 37:38.922
(Rustling)

37:38.955 --> 37:40.757
(All Gasp)

37:40.790 --> 37:43.593
It's Him!

37:43.627 --> 37:45.596
Guys, Don't Be Scared, Okay?

37:45.628 --> 37:47.431
Cobb Said That
They Feed On Fear.

37:47.464 --> 37:49.433
If Anything Comes At Us,
Stick Together.

37:49.465 --> 37:51.835
You Guys Are Being Ridiculous.

37:49.465 --> 37:51.835
(Rustling)

37:51.868 --> 37:53.804
Uh...

37:53.837 --> 37:56.407
I Think.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.742
(Rustling)

38:06.449 --> 38:07.183
(Roars)

38:07.217 --> 38:08.719
(All Scream)

38:08.752 --> 38:11.955
(Roars)

38:11.987 --> 38:13.456
(Screams)

38:13.489 --> 38:15.158
(Roars)

38:15.192 --> 38:16.560
(Screams)

38:16.592 --> 38:19.061
(Screams)

38:19.094 --> 38:21.431
(Laughter)

38:21.464 --> 38:22.665
Henry!

38:22.699 --> 38:23.867
Go!

38:23.900 --> 38:25.035
(Laughter)

38:25.067 --> 38:26.903
(Screams)

38:32.842 --> 38:34.444
(Screams)

38:37.179 --> 38:38.214
(Screams)

38:38.248 --> 38:40.684
(Laughter)

38:43.587 --> 38:44.889
(Roars)

38:46.056 --> 38:47.057
(Grunts)

38:54.498 --> 38:55.499
(Roars)

39:01.971 --> 39:03.773
Sadie! Henry!

39:03.806 --> 39:07.944
Go! Go!

39:07.978 --> 39:12.782
Â™ªâ™ª

39:07.978 --> 39:12.782
(Humming)

39:12.815 --> 39:15.252
<I>Help!

39:15.284 --> 39:18.654
Whoa! Whoa! Running In Fear!

39:18.688 --> 39:21.525
Yo, Henry, Henry.

39:18.688 --> 39:21.525
<I>(Screams)

39:21.558 --> 39:24.127
(Screams)

39:24.159 --> 39:25.194
Go!

39:25.228 --> 39:26.930
Don't Be Scared, Henry.

39:26.962 --> 39:32.099
Cobb?! Cobb?! Cobb?!

39:31.134 --> 39:32.536
Don't Be Scared.

39:32.569 --> 39:35.172
Henry, They Feed On Fear, Okay?

39:35.205 --> 39:39.576
Try To Slow Your Heart Rate.
Are You Breathing Deep?

39:39.609 --> 39:41.011
<I>I Don't Think
I'm Breathing At All.

39:46.782 --> 39:49.152
Henry! Henry!

39:49.185 --> 39:52.288
Surprise!

39:52.322 --> 39:56.660
I Smelled Your Fear
From Miles Away.

39:56.692 --> 39:59.595
Dude, You Stink!

39:59.628 --> 40:02.266
(Screams)

40:02.299 --> 40:04.502
(Panting)

40:13.909 --> 40:15.513
(Both Scream)

40:18.281 --> 40:20.083
Where's Henry?

40:20.116 --> 40:23.085
(Laughter)

40:23.118 --> 40:25.288
We Should Probably
Go See If He's Okay.

40:25.322 --> 40:27.525
(Roaring)

40:29.793 --> 40:31.228
Both: We Should Go.

40:37.701 --> 40:38.702
(Whimpers)

40:45.241 --> 40:46.643
(Whimpers)

40:58.288 --> 41:02.159
Henry! What's Wrong With Him?
Is He Okay?

41:07.230 --> 41:09.266
(Panting)

41:09.299 --> 41:12.802
He's Petrified.
He's Frozen In Fear.

41:12.835 --> 41:16.272
It's What Happens When People
Stare Down Their Monsters And Lose.

41:16.306 --> 41:20.210
Whoo! I Gotta Get To The Gym More!
This Is Ridiculous!

41:20.243 --> 41:22.045
Can You Fix Him?

41:22.078 --> 41:24.214
I'm Pretty Sure.
But Not Here.

41:24.246 --> 41:27.350
I Gotta Take Him
Back To The Lab.

41:28.717 --> 41:30.353
(Grunts)

41:34.657 --> 41:36.860
Let's Get The Two Of You
To The Mansion First.

41:48.003 --> 41:50.139
These Things Are Real?

41:50.172 --> 41:52.275
They Sure Are.

41:56.378 --> 41:57.781
Come On.

41:59.715 --> 42:02.351
Well, Scared Stiff. (Chuckles)

42:02.384 --> 42:03.786
Oh, The Irony.

42:07.357 --> 42:10.694
(Wolf Howls)

42:10.726 --> 42:13.696
(Electricity Crackling)

42:13.730 --> 42:14.932
(Gasps)

42:17.266 --> 42:18.902
Steve?

42:21.071 --> 42:22.873
Julie! Honey!

42:22.906 --> 42:24.074
Sweetheart, I'm Right Here.

42:24.107 --> 42:27.277
Oh. I Didn't Know.

42:27.310 --> 42:29.712
I Should Have
Taken That Garlic.

42:29.746 --> 42:30.914
Now? Really?

42:30.947 --> 42:32.149
Honey, Don't.

42:33.850 --> 42:35.252
Where Are We?

42:35.284 --> 42:37.087
My Dad's Old Lab.

42:37.119 --> 42:39.922
Hasn't Changed A Bit.

42:39.956 --> 42:42.325
I Wonder What She Has
In Store For Us?

42:42.357 --> 42:45.795
Excellent Question, Steven.

42:45.828 --> 42:47.763
So Glad You Asked. (Laughs)

42:47.797 --> 42:50.266
I'm Going To Destroy You,
Of Course.

42:50.299 --> 42:52.268
Take Your Bones
And Make Patio Furniture.

42:52.302 --> 42:56.106
Sort Of A Chaise Lounge Of Doom,
If You Will.

42:56.139 --> 42:59.977
As To <I>How I'll Destroy You...

43:01.344 --> 43:02.946
Anybody Wanna Guess?

43:02.978 --> 43:06.348
No? Oh, Come On. It'll Be Fun!

43:06.382 --> 43:07.717
Okay, Wait, Wait, Wait.

43:10.052 --> 43:12.022
Four Words, Right?
You See What I'm Doing?

43:12.054 --> 43:16.025
Okay...
First Word.

43:16.058 --> 43:17.259
You're Not Even Trying.

43:17.293 --> 43:19.262
Okay, First Word.
Ready, Ready, Ready?

43:19.295 --> 43:20.898
(Gasps)

43:24.333 --> 43:25.868
No? One More Time.

43:25.902 --> 43:26.904
(Gasps)

43:30.339 --> 43:32.942
Okay, Fine. I'll Just Tell You
What I'm Going To Do.

43:32.976 --> 43:35.244
I'm Going To Scare You To Death!

43:35.277 --> 43:40.516
(Laughs)

43:40.549 --> 43:42.885
Yeah, Good Luck With That.

43:42.918 --> 43:46.288
Fifteen Years Of Plotting,
That's The Best You Can Do? Sad.

43:42.918 --> 43:46.288
Really Sad.

43:46.322 --> 43:47.290
Embarrassing, Really.

43:46.322 --> 43:47.290
Humiliating.

43:47.322 --> 43:49.192
It's Terrible Material.

43:49.225 --> 43:52.228
Well, Aren't You Two
The Little Professionals?

43:52.261 --> 43:54.464
We Don't Scare Easy.
We're Mycologists.

43:54.496 --> 43:57.533
Yes, Fungi Makes You Brave.

43:57.567 --> 44:00.971
No Worries, You'll Show Me
Fear Enough When I'm Terrifying

44:01.003 --> 44:03.440
Your Daughter Right
In Front Of You.

44:03.473 --> 44:08.878
Ooh, There It Is.
There It Is. (Laughs)

44:08.911 --> 44:10.279
That's What I Like To See.

44:10.313 --> 44:12.950
Gotta Fly! Ta-Ta!

44:15.384 --> 44:17.386
(Panting)

44:21.991 --> 44:24.795
(Panting) That's It.

44:24.828 --> 44:26.228
That's It. No More Running.

44:26.261 --> 44:27.797
(Exhales Deeply)

44:27.831 --> 44:30.233
You're Not Really
Gonna Leave Us?

44:30.266 --> 44:33.235
I Have To Take Him Back,
Thaw Him Out,

44:33.268 --> 44:34.870
And I Have To Fix
The Containment Tank

44:34.904 --> 44:37.273
So It's Ready When Your Parents
Hunt Down Deimata.

44:37.306 --> 44:41.511
My Parents...
Will They Be Okay?

44:41.543 --> 44:46.449
Oh, Yeah.
They're Professionals.

44:46.482 --> 44:50.052
Will I Be Okay?

44:50.085 --> 44:53.022
You'll Be Fine.

44:53.056 --> 44:56.025
Don't Forget,
You're A Monster Hunter.

44:56.058 --> 44:59.228
Fifth Generation.
You Scare The Monsters.

44:59.261 --> 45:01.263
Not The Other Way Around.

45:01.297 --> 45:07.337
Oh, Right. Of Course.
I Mean, It's A Piece Of Cake.

45:07.369 --> 45:08.471
(Laughs)

45:08.503 --> 45:11.473
Okay, Just Breathe! Breathe!

45:11.507 --> 45:13.476
Okay, I Need You
To Keep An Eye On Her.

45:13.509 --> 45:15.579
You're Gonna Have
To Be The Brave One.

45:15.612 --> 45:18.581
You Have No Idea
How Insane That Is.

45:18.614 --> 45:20.317
Terrific.

45:22.284 --> 45:23.286
Oh!

45:24.286 --> 45:26.322
Oopsy Daisy. (Chuckles)

45:28.324 --> 45:30.159
Go. I'll Get Him.

45:35.464 --> 45:38.067
(Grunts)

45:40.969 --> 45:43.939
What Do Ya Say, Boss?
Grab Skylar Now?

45:43.973 --> 45:47.344
Not Yet. My Powers
Aren't Quite Strong Enough.

45:47.377 --> 45:50.179
I Need To Eat More
Of That Girl's Fear.

45:50.212 --> 45:54.183
Then Let's Swoop Down From
The Rafters And Bon Appetit!

45:54.217 --> 45:59.623
Later.
First, I Have A Hankering For A Different Flavor Of Fear.

45:59.656 --> 46:01.324
Where Ya Goin'?

46:01.357 --> 46:04.360
It's A Halloween Party.
I Need A Costume.

46:06.395 --> 46:08.564
You Think We Need Costumes?

46:08.598 --> 46:10.567
If You Were Any Stupider,

46:10.600 --> 46:13.203
I Could Sell You
As A Paperweight.

46:13.235 --> 46:15.672
Oh, Don't Be A Hater.

46:15.705 --> 46:17.641
(Laughs)

46:17.674 --> 46:19.109
It Never Gets Old.

46:19.141 --> 46:22.212
(Laughs)

46:22.244 --> 46:26.083
(Grunting)

46:29.685 --> 46:33.289
(Grunting)

46:44.400 --> 46:49.406
(Sniffing)

46:50.605 --> 46:54.610
(Gasping)

46:56.545 --> 47:00.250
(Laughs)

47:13.261 --> 47:16.265
(Cracks)

47:16.299 --> 47:19.469
(Exhales)

47:19.502 --> 47:24.708
Deimata: Now That's What
I Call Smokin' Hot.

47:27.509 --> 47:32.348
(Laughs)

47:34.049 --> 47:39.355
â™ªâ™ª

47:46.462 --> 47:48.264
She's Not Here Yet.

47:48.297 --> 47:51.101
We Can't Wait
All Night For Skylar.

47:51.134 --> 47:53.737
(Sighs) I Guess
I'll Just Do The Singing.

47:53.770 --> 47:56.339
You Cool With That?
Not Too Nervous?

47:56.371 --> 47:59.009
No. I Got This.

48:10.250 --> 48:11.451
Do I Look Okay?

48:11.485 --> 48:13.287
What Do You Mean?

48:13.319 --> 48:17.491
Is My Hair All Messed Up?
Should I Have Gotten It Cut?

48:17.525 --> 48:20.494
Is That A Pimple?
It Feels Like A Pimple.

48:20.527 --> 48:22.129
What On Earth Are You--

48:22.163 --> 48:24.298
Fifteen Years' Worth Of Fear
All At Once.

48:24.331 --> 48:27.335
Seriously,
Should I Cover This Up?

48:27.368 --> 48:29.170
Maybe I Should Just Go Home.

48:29.203 --> 48:30.405
Skylar, You're Beautiful.

48:30.438 --> 48:32.407
Come On,
We'll Hide Out In The Crowd.

48:32.440 --> 48:35.010
It's Not Like Everybody's
Gonna Be Staring At You.

48:36.444 --> 48:38.212
Ryan: Here She Is!

48:38.244 --> 48:40.281
Ladies And Gentlemen,
Skylar Lewis!

48:40.313 --> 48:42.116
Skylar's Agreed
To Sing With Us Tonight!

48:42.148 --> 48:45.185
Oh, No! I Totally Forgot!

48:45.219 --> 48:47.722
Clear A Path For Her, Everybody!

48:49.656 --> 48:51.625
(Echoing)<I>
Why Am I Feeling This?

48:51.659 --> 48:55.296
Come On Up, Sky.
Don't Be Bashful.

48:55.328 --> 49:00.368
(Echoing)<I>
Just Don't Let It Scare You.

49:00.400 --> 49:01.802
(Echoing)<I>
My Heart's Racing.

49:01.835 --> 49:03.437
(Echoing)<I>
Something's Very Wrong With Me.

49:03.471 --> 49:05.505
(Echoing)<I>
These Things Are Real?

49:05.538 --> 49:07.340
Ryan: <I>Standing Up On Stage
In Front Of All Those People.

49:07.373 --> 49:10.177
Deimata:<I>
Hello, World. Mommy's Home.

49:10.210 --> 49:12.379
Ryan: (Echoing)<I>
It's Terrifying.

49:12.413 --> 49:15.382
Sadie: (Echoing) <I>Nothing Scares You.
You're Not Normal.

49:15.415 --> 49:20.220
(Echoing) <I>That's Just Gonna
Come Back To Haunt You.

49:20.253 --> 49:24.424
Remember, Just Lose Yourself
In The Music.

49:24.458 --> 49:27.862
I Am Definitely Lost.

49:27.895 --> 49:31.264
(Chuckles) Hit It, Guys.

49:31.297 --> 49:34.301
Â™ªâ™ª

49:53.286 --> 49:54.888
(Music Stops)

49:54.922 --> 49:56.757
(All Murmuring)

49:56.790 --> 49:59.427
You Can Do This.

50:04.431 --> 50:07.735
Keep It Together, Sky.

50:07.768 --> 50:10.371
Â™ªâ™ª

50:10.404 --> 50:14.609
â™ª Hey, Look Out World,
'Cause Here I Come â™ª

50:14.641 --> 50:18.378
â™ª I'm Burning Brighter
Than The Sun â™ª

50:18.411 --> 50:22.250
â™ª You Put Up Walls,
But I Can Break 'Em â™ª

50:22.282 --> 50:25.453
â™ª Break 'Em â™ª

50:25.485 --> 50:29.389
â™ª Fear Is Not
A Roadblock In My Way â™ª

50:29.422 --> 50:32.493
â™ª Don't Care What
The Haters Say â™ª

50:32.525 --> 50:37.498
â™ª They Don't Scare Me,
I'm Not Shakin' â™ª

50:37.531 --> 50:38.866
â™ª Shakin' â™ª

50:38.898 --> 50:42.203
â™ª If You Think
I'm Gonna Quit â™ª

50:42.235 --> 50:45.339
â™ª Go And Cross It
Off Your List â™ª

50:45.371 --> 50:49.543
â™ª I Just Wanna Scream Out Loud â™ª

50:49.576 --> 50:53.346
â™ª Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now â™ª

50:53.380 --> 51:00.288
(Laughs)
Stage Fright...

51:00.321 --> 51:03.625
One Of My Favorites! (Laughs)

51:07.293 --> 51:11.331
(Claps)

51:11.364 --> 51:14.502
(Chuckles) Amazing.

51:14.534 --> 51:16.337
That Was...

51:16.369 --> 51:18.473
Indescribable.

51:21.976 --> 51:25.413
This Must Be So Humiliating
For You--

51:25.446 --> 51:27.915
The Embarrassment
Of A Lifetime!

51:27.947 --> 51:30.283
(Laughs)

51:30.317 --> 51:32.253
(Feedback Wails)

51:32.286 --> 51:34.956
I'll Take It From Here.

51:34.989 --> 51:37.858
Push The Tempo, Boys.

51:37.891 --> 51:40.261
(All Murmuring)

51:40.293 --> 51:41.596
What Happened To Your Neck?

51:41.628 --> 51:45.398
I Found A Doctor
Who's Out Of This World.

51:45.431 --> 51:47.301
Sky!

51:47.333 --> 51:49.703
Â™ªâ™ª

51:49.737 --> 51:53.307
â™ª Hey, Look Out World,
'Cause Here I Come â™ª

51:53.339 --> 51:56.409
â™ª I'm Burning Brighter

51:56.442 --> 51:59.679
â™ª You Put Up Walls,
But I Can Break 'Em â™ª

51:59.712 --> 52:01.481
â™ª Break 'Em â™ª

52:01.514 --> 52:05.485
â™ª Fear Is Not
A Roadblock In My Way â™ª

52:05.518 --> 52:08.288
â™ª Don't Care What
The Haters Say â™ª

52:08.322 --> 52:11.425
â™ª You Don't Scare Me,
I'm Not Shakin' â™ª

52:11.458 --> 52:12.827
â™ª Shakin' â™ª

52:12.860 --> 52:15.563
â™ª If You Think
I'm Gonna Quit â™ª

52:17.897 --> 52:21.034
Sadie: Skylar,
What Are You Doing?

52:21.067 --> 52:23.436
(Muffled)
I Didn't Have Dinner.

52:23.469 --> 52:26.674
Oh, Slow Down!
You're Gonna Choke!

52:26.706 --> 52:28.308
(Muffled) Fine With Me.

52:28.342 --> 52:30.378
You Can't Eat Your Fear.

52:30.411 --> 52:33.547
I'm Not Eating My Fear.

52:33.580 --> 52:35.348
I'm Eating A Snickerdoodle.

52:35.382 --> 52:36.584
(Sighs)

52:36.616 --> 52:40.420
Sadie, This Is
The Worst Day Of My Life!

52:40.453 --> 52:44.924
And I Have This Awful, Queasy Feeling In
My Stomach That I Just Can't Get Rid Of!

52:44.958 --> 52:47.395
I Told You That That's Fear.

52:47.427 --> 52:49.529
Well, How Do I Stop It?

52:49.563 --> 52:52.532
You Can't.

52:52.565 --> 52:56.536
You Just Have To Live With It,
Like Everybody Else On Earth.

52:56.569 --> 52:59.939
(Sighs) It's Too Much.

52:59.973 --> 53:01.375
Sky...

53:01.407 --> 53:03.710
(Beep)

53:07.047 --> 53:08.983
(Beeping)

53:09.016 --> 53:10.951
Uh-Oh.

53:10.984 --> 53:13.353
Â™ª You Don't Wanna Mess With Me â™ª

53:13.386 --> 53:17.357
â™ª I Know Who I'm Meant To Be â™ª

53:17.391 --> 53:19.827
â™ª Never Gonna Slow Me Down â™ª

53:19.860 --> 53:23.064
â™ª Nothing's Gonna Stop Me,
Nothing's Gonna Stop Me â™ª

53:23.096 --> 53:27.400
â™ª Now-Ow-Ow-Ow-Ow-Ow-Ow-Ow â™ª

53:27.433 --> 53:29.436
â™ª Nothing's Gonna Stop Me â™ª

53:29.469 --> 53:33.440
â™ª Now-Ow-Ow-Ow-Ow-Ow-Ow-Ow â™ª

53:33.473 --> 53:34.542
â™ª Nothing's Gonna Stop Me â™ª

53:37.444 --> 53:38.446
(Gasps)

53:41.949 --> 53:44.485
Sadie...

53:44.518 --> 53:47.487
Look At This!

53:47.520 --> 53:48.989
What Is It?

53:51.958 --> 53:53.927
It's My Mother.

53:53.960 --> 53:55.362
Come Here.

53:57.096 --> 53:58.898
Â™ª Nothing's Gonna Stop Me â™ª

53:58.931 --> 54:02.502
â™ª Now-Ow-Ow-Ow-Ow-Ow-Ow-Ow â™ª

54:02.536 --> 54:06.040
â™ª Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now â™ª

54:12.746 --> 54:15.782
(Cheering And Applause)

54:21.688 --> 54:23.057
Where You Going?

54:23.089 --> 54:25.892
To Find A Band
That Can Play In Tune.

54:25.926 --> 54:29.529
Oh, You're Deadweight,
Sweetheart.

54:29.563 --> 54:33.768
The Kind Of Terrible That
Doesn't Get Better With Practice.

54:35.701 --> 54:36.870
(Chuckles)

54:36.904 --> 54:41.509
(Cheering And Applause)

54:52.552 --> 54:55.522
That's The Mcquarry Mansion.

54:55.556 --> 54:56.924
She Lived Here?

54:56.956 --> 54:58.558
This Can't Be Right.

54:58.592 --> 55:00.427
My Mom Would've Told Me.

55:00.460 --> 55:03.096
Like She Told You
About Being A Monster Hunter?

55:03.130 --> 55:05.433
That Deimata
Drove Him Over The Edge...

55:05.465 --> 55:07.067
Just Like Old Man Mcquarry.

55:07.100 --> 55:09.737
He Shut Himself Up
In This House For Years.

55:09.770 --> 55:12.572
What If Edgar Mcquarry
Is My Grandfather?

55:12.605 --> 55:14.073
Maybe That's Why
They're All Here.

55:14.107 --> 55:15.074
(Beeping)

55:15.107 --> 55:16.075
Who's All Where?

55:16.109 --> 55:17.911
Skylar, Look At This.

55:17.944 --> 55:20.947
This Mansion
Is Crawling With Monsters.

55:20.980 --> 55:22.917
We Gotta Get Out Of Here!

55:22.949 --> 55:24.785
No.

55:25.953 --> 55:27.822
What Do You Mean, No?

55:27.855 --> 55:30.057
All Of Our Friends Are Here.

55:30.089 --> 55:32.091
If We Leave,
What Happens To Them?

55:32.125 --> 55:34.094
Well, What Good Can We Do?

55:34.127 --> 55:37.965
We're The Only Ones
With The Tools To Fight Them.

55:40.766 --> 55:45.205
And One Of Us Is A Fifth-Generation Monster Hunter.

55:46.272 --> 55:51.478
I Can't. I'm Too Scared.

55:51.511 --> 55:53.112
I've Been Scared All My Life.

55:53.145 --> 55:55.515
And You Know What
I Learned About Fear?

55:55.549 --> 55:58.518
When You Run Away From It,
It Just Gets Worse.

55:58.552 --> 56:01.789
Come On, You Can Do This.

56:04.690 --> 56:06.659
I Hate You.

56:06.692 --> 56:08.661
(Chuckles)
I Hate You, Too.

56:08.694 --> 56:10.096
Let's Go.

56:12.098 --> 56:14.701
(Whimpering)

56:14.735 --> 56:16.571
Okay, Stuff I Need,
Stuff I Need.

56:26.779 --> 56:28.782
Make It Purple.

56:35.054 --> 56:36.890
(Sighs) Let's Go, Henry.

56:38.190 --> 56:40.159
Please Don't Hurt Me,
Mister Scarecrow!

56:40.192 --> 56:42.229
(Chuckles)

56:45.197 --> 56:47.567
Sorry, That's Just...

56:47.601 --> 56:49.169
What Was On
The Tip Of My Tongue.

56:49.201 --> 56:51.170
It Happens To The Best Of Us.

56:51.203 --> 56:55.008
(Sighs)
Man, I Was So Out Of It.

56:55.042 --> 56:57.844
It's Like I Could Hear
And See Everything,

56:57.877 --> 56:59.713
But I Was Too Scared
To Even Move.

57:02.214 --> 57:04.651
I Totally Wussed Out.

57:04.685 --> 57:07.087
Skylar And Sadie
Were Counting On Me.

57:07.119 --> 57:09.290
(Grunts) You'll Come Through
For 'Em Next Time.

57:09.322 --> 57:13.293
Are You Kidding?
I'm Useless!

57:13.326 --> 57:14.294
I'm Going Home.

57:14.328 --> 57:15.963
Good Idea.

57:15.996 --> 57:17.764
Yeah, I Mean,
If Something's Too Hard,

57:17.797 --> 57:20.167
It's Always Best To Just Curl Up
Into A Little Ball And Quit.

57:20.199 --> 57:24.705
I Mean, Who Cares If Your Friends Are
Still In A Jam And They Need Your Help?

57:26.272 --> 57:31.144
I Can't Help Them.
I'm A Coward.

57:31.177 --> 57:37.217
It Doesn't Take A Hero
To Help Fix A Containment Unit.

57:38.250 --> 57:40.153
(Sighs) What Do You Need?

57:40.186 --> 57:44.157
It's Mostly Welding And, Uh...

57:44.190 --> 57:48.261
Whoa, Yeah,
It Is Real Gross In There, So...

58:03.743 --> 58:05.278
(Growls)

58:03.743 --> 58:05.278
(Both Gasp)

58:05.311 --> 58:07.147
Whoa! Chill Out!

58:07.179 --> 58:08.147
(Both Sigh)

58:08.181 --> 58:09.883
Hey, Josh.

58:09.915 --> 58:12.318
What's Up With The Arsenal?

58:12.351 --> 58:14.321
Uh...

58:12.351 --> 58:14.321
Uh...

58:14.353 --> 58:16.656
Just A Costume.

58:16.690 --> 58:17.657
(Both Laugh)

58:17.690 --> 58:19.058
You-You Know, Uh...

58:19.092 --> 58:21.195
(Imitating Gunfire)

58:21.228 --> 58:23.230
Oh, Funny.

58:23.263 --> 58:25.866
Yeah. Bye.

58:25.898 --> 58:27.701
Josh?

58:27.734 --> 58:29.203
Yeah?

58:29.235 --> 58:32.373
Where Are Your Feet?

58:36.208 --> 58:37.277
(Screams)

58:37.310 --> 58:38.311
(Gasps)

58:38.344 --> 58:39.913
(Screams)

58:42.181 --> 58:43.282
(Roars)

58:43.315 --> 58:44.384
(Both Scream)

58:48.020 --> 58:49.156
(Roars)

58:49.188 --> 58:52.158
(Screams)

58:52.192 --> 58:55.128
(Roars)

58:55.161 --> 59:01.368
(Banging)

59:13.080 --> 59:15.181
(Roars)

59:16.315 --> 59:17.317
(Roars)

59:18.317 --> 59:19.753
(Roars)

59:21.922 --> 59:23.190
Sadie!

59:24.790 --> 59:26.726
(Screams)

59:26.759 --> 59:28.763
(Roars)

59:30.263 --> 59:32.232
The Wrist Blaster!
Use That!

59:32.264 --> 59:33.900
I Can't See!

59:35.134 --> 59:37.036
(Roars)

59:37.069 --> 59:38.805
Come On, Get Them Out!
Hurry!

59:38.839 --> 59:40.239
I'm Sorry!

59:38.839 --> 59:40.239
Go!

59:40.272 --> 59:42.275
(Screams) Okay!

59:45.811 --> 59:46.779
Okay!

59:46.813 --> 59:47.815
We Did It!

59:47.848 --> 59:50.250
(Both Laugh)

59:50.282 --> 59:53.219
We're Gonna Need
More Of Those.

59:50.282 --> 59:53.219
Yeah. (Chuckles)

59:59.458 --> 01:00:01.427
(Exhales Deeply)

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.263
How's This Look?

01:00:03.295 --> 01:00:05.331
Fantastic.
You're A Natural.

01:00:10.136 --> 01:00:13.239
All Right,
Let's Put The Welder Down.

01:00:13.272 --> 01:00:15.241
(Phone Rings)

01:00:15.275 --> 01:00:17.244
Skylar! Skylar!

01:00:17.277 --> 01:00:19.913
Cobb? How's Henry?

01:00:19.946 --> 01:00:22.215
Uh, He-He's Okay. You Guys?

01:00:22.248 --> 01:00:25.252
We're Fine.
We Caught A Monster!

01:00:25.284 --> 01:00:28.087
But There's A Lot More In Here.
We're Gonna Need More Pcu's.

01:00:28.121 --> 01:00:31.525
Um, O-Okay. Um, I Will
Run Some Right Over.

01:00:31.558 --> 01:00:32.525
(Beeps)

01:00:32.558 --> 01:00:34.360
(Both Laugh)

01:00:34.393 --> 01:00:36.196
Okay, Whoa!

01:00:36.228 --> 01:00:37.431
Wait.

01:00:39.299 --> 01:00:40.301
Okay.

01:00:39.299 --> 01:00:40.301
Okay.

01:00:44.871 --> 01:00:46.273
Henry: What Happened?
Are They Okay?

01:00:46.306 --> 01:00:49.443
They're Fine.
They Need More Traps.

01:00:49.476 --> 01:00:53.280
Wish I Could Be In
Two Places At Once.

01:00:53.313 --> 01:00:55.315
Sit Tight For A Few.
I'll Be Back.

01:00:55.348 --> 01:00:59.319
Wait. (Sighs)
Give Me The Bag.

01:00:59.351 --> 01:01:01.054
I'll Run It Over To Them.

01:01:01.087 --> 01:01:02.790
You Sure?

01:01:02.822 --> 01:01:05.025
(Sighs)

01:01:07.493 --> 01:01:09.061
(Grunts)

01:01:09.094 --> 01:01:11.063
Yeah, I'm Sure.

01:01:11.096 --> 01:01:12.498
Go Get 'Em, Tiger.

01:01:12.531 --> 01:01:13.867
Okay.

01:01:18.371 --> 01:01:20.307
You Okay Fixing That Alone?

01:01:20.339 --> 01:01:22.542
I'll Manage.
Uh, Henry...

01:01:31.951 --> 01:01:34.388
Ooh, He Is A Goner.

01:01:36.056 --> 01:01:38.324
It Really Doesn't Matter.

01:01:36.056 --> 01:01:38.324
No, It Does Matter.

01:01:38.357 --> 01:01:40.060
It Would've Made
A Big Difference.

01:01:40.092 --> 01:01:41.427
Rock The Same Direction
That I'm Rocking.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:43.429
How Am I Supposed To Know
What Direction That Is?

01:01:43.462 --> 01:01:45.231
Work Together!

01:01:43.462 --> 01:01:45.231
(Sighs)

01:01:45.264 --> 01:01:47.234
Now You're Just Banging!

01:01:45.264 --> 01:01:47.234
No, I Am Not Just Banging!

01:01:48.534 --> 01:01:50.337
What's Going On?

01:01:48.534 --> 01:01:50.337
Around The Corner.

01:01:50.369 --> 01:01:51.839
Where Are We Going?
What Are We Doing?

01:01:51.871 --> 01:01:52.973
Shh!

01:01:51.871 --> 01:01:52.973
Okay.

01:01:53.005 --> 01:01:56.375
(Roars)

01:01:56.409 --> 01:01:58.212
She's Gaining Confidence.

01:01:58.244 --> 01:02:01.147
What Can We Do To Get Those
Fear Juices Flowing Again?

01:02:01.181 --> 01:02:03.383
Stay Away From Our Friends!

01:02:03.415 --> 01:02:04.884
Yeah!

01:02:04.918 --> 01:02:07.888
Seems Awfully Fond
Of Her Friends.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.924
And There's Quite A Lot
Of Them In That Ballroom.

01:02:12.391 --> 01:02:13.860
Let's Go.

01:02:15.561 --> 01:02:17.364
Summon The Others.

01:02:17.397 --> 01:02:21.168
It's Time For A Little
Feast Of Mass Hysteria.

01:02:21.201 --> 01:02:25.038
(All Laugh)

01:02:25.071 --> 01:02:26.906
Right! That's The Idea!

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.308
Summon Their Mothers? Why?

01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.609
So Stupid!

01:02:29.643 --> 01:02:32.612
Ugh! This Costume
Is Starting To Stink.

01:02:32.645 --> 01:02:34.080
(Grunts)

01:02:35.447 --> 01:02:37.417
Uh, Uh, Uh...

01:02:38.585 --> 01:02:39.887
(Blows)

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.121
(Screams)

01:02:41.154 --> 01:02:42.155
(Laughs)

01:02:42.188 --> 01:02:45.926
(Groaning)

01:02:47.927 --> 01:02:49.529
Wanna Dance?

01:02:49.561 --> 01:02:52.331
(Screams)

01:02:52.364 --> 01:02:53.433
Oh, I Guess Not.

01:02:53.465 --> 01:02:54.935
Your Loss.

01:02:56.036 --> 01:02:59.373
(Myra Whimpering)

01:02:59.406 --> 01:03:01.375
Ow!

01:03:01.407 --> 01:03:03.409
Myra! Are You Okay?

01:03:03.442 --> 01:03:06.612
There Was This Horrible Woman.

01:03:06.645 --> 01:03:08.180
She Took Me Over.

01:03:08.214 --> 01:03:11.018
Wait. Deimata!

01:03:11.051 --> 01:03:12.252
Which Way Did She Go?

01:03:12.284 --> 01:03:15.455
Upstairs. The Ballroom.

01:03:17.324 --> 01:03:19.493
Thanks. Let's Go.

01:03:21.094 --> 01:03:22.462
See Ya.

01:03:21.094 --> 01:03:22.462
Wait...

01:03:22.494 --> 01:03:26.065
Have You Guys
Seen My Neck Brace?

01:03:26.098 --> 01:03:28.067
Probably In My Room.

01:03:28.101 --> 01:03:31.305
Could Somebody Call Me A Cab?

01:03:31.337 --> 01:03:32.505
(Sighs)

01:03:33.505 --> 01:03:35.341
(Owl Hoots)

01:03:43.083 --> 01:03:44.318
(Owl Hoots)

01:03:49.089 --> 01:03:50.324
(Exhales Deeply)

01:03:52.192 --> 01:03:55.594
â™ª Creeping Around
This Madness, Madness â™ª

01:03:55.627 --> 01:03:59.465
â™ª No Horror Flick
Can Top This, Top This â™ª

01:03:59.498 --> 01:04:02.034
Has Anybody Seen Skylar?

01:04:02.067 --> 01:04:03.536
Mm-Mm.

01:04:02.067 --> 01:04:03.536
Nope.

01:04:03.569 --> 01:04:07.406
Â™ª There's Something In The Air â™ª

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:11.311
â™ª Shadows Everywhere â™ª

01:04:12.612 --> 01:04:13.981
(Owl Hoots)

01:04:14.014 --> 01:04:15.983
(Rustling)

01:04:16.016 --> 01:04:19.987
(Laughter)

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:25.092
Henry! Henry!

01:04:25.125 --> 01:04:29.295
Hey, Dude, Long Time No Scare!

01:04:29.328 --> 01:04:33.433
Thanks For Comin' Back
And Feedin' Me Again!

01:04:34.467 --> 01:04:36.235
Oh!

01:04:36.268 --> 01:04:38.437
Didn't See That Coming.

01:04:38.471 --> 01:04:41.273
Nice Try, Jelly Fingers.

01:04:41.306 --> 01:04:44.310
This Might Hurt... A Lot.

01:04:44.344 --> 01:04:47.681
(Laughs)

01:04:47.714 --> 01:04:54.253
â™ªâ™ª

01:05:06.132 --> 01:05:07.734
You Didn't Tell Us About This.

01:05:07.766 --> 01:05:09.301
I Didn't Know About This.

01:05:09.335 --> 01:05:10.302
Whoa.

01:05:10.335 --> 01:05:12.104
(Deimata Laughs)

01:05:12.138 --> 01:05:13.105
(Music Stops)

01:05:13.139 --> 01:05:17.210
Welcome To Your Worst Nightmare!

01:05:17.243 --> 01:05:19.578
(Laughs)

01:05:19.612 --> 01:05:21.114
(All Scream)

01:05:21.147 --> 01:05:23.449

01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:39.299
(Screams)

01:05:39.331 --> 01:05:45.304
So, Henry, Need To Change
Your Pants Yet?

01:05:45.337 --> 01:05:47.606
I'm Not Scared Of You.

01:05:47.639 --> 01:05:49.109
Course You Are.

01:05:49.141 --> 01:05:51.210
Scared Of Me,
Scared Of The Dark,

01:05:51.243 --> 01:05:54.246
Scared Of The Kids
Who Pick On You In Gym.

01:05:54.279 --> 01:05:59.319
Face It, Dude,
You're Scared Of Everything!

01:05:59.351 --> 01:06:00.619
No, I'm Not!

01:06:00.652 --> 01:06:02.288
You're A Coward!

01:06:02.322 --> 01:06:05.258
Always Have Been,
Always Will Be!

01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:11.230
I'm... Not... Scared...
Of You!

01:06:11.264 --> 01:06:16.269
Yes... You... Are!

01:06:16.302 --> 01:06:17.838
No!

01:06:17.871 --> 01:06:20.607
Leave Me Alone!

01:06:20.639 --> 01:06:23.609
(Grunts)

01:06:23.643 --> 01:06:25.278
I'm Through With You.

01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:26.446
Ow!

01:06:26.478 --> 01:06:27.547
Whoo-Ee!

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.415
(Panting)

01:06:29.449 --> 01:06:31.251
How Long Have We
Known Each Other?

01:06:31.284 --> 01:06:33.753
Please, Be Scared Of Me.
Please. Pretty Please.

01:06:33.786 --> 01:06:36.590
You're Finished.

01:06:36.623 --> 01:06:43.429
Finished? Wait,
I'll Be Scarier Boo! Boo! Boo?

01:06:47.633 --> 01:06:51.736

01:06:59.544 --> 01:07:00.546
(Roars)

01:07:01.912 --> 01:07:03.581
Take It!

01:07:05.816 --> 01:07:08.786
(Sighs)
There's Too Many Of Them!

01:07:08.819 --> 01:07:12.925
Just Try To Stay Calm.
This Is Not The Time To Freak Out.

01:07:12.957 --> 01:07:14.593
I Don't Know About That.

01:07:14.626 --> 01:07:16.095
(Both Scream)

01:07:16.127 --> 01:07:19.097
I'd Say It's The Perfect Time
To Freak Out.

01:07:19.131 --> 01:07:20.531
Wouldn't You, Witch?

01:07:20.564 --> 01:07:21.934
Indubitably.

01:07:21.966 --> 01:07:25.069
There's Another Word
You Can't Spell!

01:07:25.102 --> 01:07:28.106
(Both Whimper)

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:30.642
Not Your Night At All,
Is It, Dearie?

01:07:30.675 --> 01:07:37.482
First You Humiliate Yourself With That Horrid
Singing In Front Of Everyone! (Laughs)

01:07:37.515 --> 01:07:41.953
Don't Think That Won't Haunt
You For The Rest Of Your Life.

01:07:41.986 --> 01:07:43.988
Henry: Skylar!

01:07:45.689 --> 01:07:49.093
If You Just Show Courage,
They'll Shrink Down To Nothing!

01:07:49.127 --> 01:07:51.530
Whatever Scares You, Just Do It!

01:07:53.664 --> 01:07:55.633
Nonsense.

01:08:12.017 --> 01:08:15.421
I Am Smart And Confident.

01:08:15.453 --> 01:08:18.524
You're Stupid And Weak.

01:08:19.524 --> 01:08:21.493
I Am Confident.

01:08:21.524 --> 01:08:25.430
Spell "Goat" For Me!

01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:30.201
G... E...

01:08:30.234 --> 01:08:31.703

01:08:37.575 --> 01:08:39.176

01:08:39.211 --> 01:08:41.613
Hey, Skylar! Hey, I've Been
Looking All Over For You!

01:08:41.645 --> 01:08:44.615
Get Your Guitar! Back Me Up!

01:08:44.649 --> 01:08:46.118

Just Stand Up To Them!
Whatever Scares You, Just Do It!

01:08:54.191 --> 01:08:55.560
Your Guitar's Wireless, Right?

01:08:55.593 --> 01:08:56.729
Follow Me!

01:08:58.562 --> 01:09:00.531
Find The Band!

01:09:00.564 --> 01:09:01.767
Okay.

01:09:54.785 --> 01:09:57.789
(All Screaming)

01:09:59.891 --> 01:10:07.299
What Kind Of A Featherhead
Can't Even Spell "Goat"?!

01:10:07.332 --> 01:10:11.503
(Laughs)

01:10:12.904 --> 01:10:16.275
G... A...

01:10:16.307 --> 01:10:17.609
No.

01:10:17.641 --> 01:10:20.044
(Laughs)

01:10:20.078 --> 01:10:21.713
G...

I...

01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:25.751
Skylar: Sadie!

01:10:25.784 --> 01:10:27.786
(All Screaming)

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:34.292
You're Not Actually
Going To Sing, Are You?

01:10:34.325 --> 01:10:36.194
You'll Scare Them To Death!

01:10:39.163 --> 01:10:41.632
You're The Worst Singer
On Earth!

01:10:41.665 --> 01:10:44.302
(Whimpers)

01:10:50.307 --> 01:10:53.578
Get Down From There.
You Look Like An Idiot.

01:11:04.756 --> 01:11:08.193
Â™ª You Used To Make
My Heart Pound â™ª

01:11:08.226 --> 01:11:10.028

â™ª Always Blowing Through â™ª

01:11:16.034 --> 01:11:19.004
â™ª But I Won't Take It Anymore â™ª

01:11:19.037 --> 01:11:24.376
â™ª That's Not What
I Came Here For â™ª

01:11:24.409 --> 01:11:26.378
â™ª I'm Stuck In Your Head â™ª

01:11:26.410 --> 01:11:28.212

01:11:41.325 --> 01:11:42.895
Ugh! Stop!

01:11:47.899 --> 01:11:50.334

01:15:23.347 --> 01:15:25.583
Tell Me Something, Dearie.

01:15:25.617 --> 01:15:30.021
At Some Point Tonight,
Did You Lose A Couple Of... Parents?

01:15:30.053 --> 01:15:34.426
(Laughs)

01:15:52.476 --> 01:15:56.480

01:16:33.952 --> 01:16:34.953
(Gasps)

01:16:41.292 --> 01:16:43.495
One More Step And I Drop Them!

01:16:43.528 --> 01:16:47.464
Didn't Think You Could
Just Sing Me Away, Did You?

01:16:47.498 --> 01:16:49.968
I'm No
Ordinary Monster, Dearie.

01:16:50.001 --> 01:16:53.370
There's A Reason
They Call Me The Eternal One.

01:16:53.404 --> 01:16:54.606
Skylar, Run!

01:16:54.638 --> 01:16:56.507
Shut Up, Steve!

01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:58.276
(Groans)

01:16:59.744 --> 01:17:03.548
Don't Be Afraid!
She Feeds On Your Fear!

01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:09.320
Enough! Honestly, One More Word
And You Two Go Splat!

01:17:18.029 --> 01:17:20.966
Come On, Henry!
We Got To Help Her!

01:17:22.432 --> 01:17:25.502
You May Have Vanquished
The Monsters Downstairs,

01:17:25.535 --> 01:17:26.503
But There'll Be More.

01:17:26.537 --> 01:17:28.740
There's Always More!

01:17:28.772 --> 01:17:31.208
Because There's Always Fear.

01:17:31.242 --> 01:17:33.445
And It's Fear
That Makes The Monsters,

01:17:33.477 --> 01:17:35.980
Not The Other Way Around.

01:17:37.547 --> 01:17:41.652
What If You Let My Parents Go
And Take Me Instead?

01:17:41.686 --> 01:17:43.088
What?!

01:17:41.686 --> 01:17:43.088
What?!

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.355
I'm Sorry, Come Again?

01:17:44.388 --> 01:17:46.391
If You Put Them
Back On The Roof,

01:17:46.423 --> 01:17:48.325
You Can Do What
You Want With Me.

01:17:48.359 --> 01:17:49.561
No, Honey!

01:17:48.359 --> 01:17:49.561
Don't Do It!

01:17:49.593 --> 01:17:51.428
I'd Make That Deal.

01:17:51.462 --> 01:17:54.332
But First Lose The Blaster.

01:17:54.364 --> 01:17:56.501
No, Honey!

01:17:54.364 --> 01:17:56.501
No!

01:17:56.534 --> 01:17:58.336
Julie: Don't Do It!

01:17:58.369 --> 01:18:01.540
Uh-Uh-Uh-Uh-Uh, The Other

01:19:00.765 --> 01:19:02.467
She Got Bigger!

01:19:02.499 --> 01:19:04.735
She's Feeding
On Your Fear, Honey!

01:19:04.769 --> 01:19:07.271
She's Feeding
On Your Fear, Honey!

01:19:07.305 --> 01:19:09.374
(Screams)

01:19:11.641 --> 01:19:13.644
(Grunts) Stay Here!

01:19:15.378 --> 01:19:17.481
Yeah, I'm Definitely

01:19:17.515 --> 01:19:18.783
Good Plan.

01:19:18.815 --> 01:19:22.453
(Laughs) Where Did You Go?

01:19:28.391 --> 01:19:30.394

Don't Be Afraid!
It's Making Her Stronger!

01:19:44.475 --> 01:19:47.111
I'm Not Afraid!
She's Feeding On Your Fear!

01:19:47.145 --> 01:19:51.449
Mom, Dad, You've Got To Trust Me

01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:01.592
What?

01:20:01.626 --> 01:20:05.195

She's A Young Adult.
We Can Accept That.

01:23:53.156 --> 01:23:55.592
Enough To Raise My Curfew?

01:23:55.626 --> 01:23:57.994
Yeah. Yeah, We Can Bump It,
Like, A Half Hour.

01:23:58.028 --> 01:24:00.597
Come On,
I Just Saved Your Lives!

01:24:00.631 --> 01:24:01.798
That's A Good Point.
That's A Good Point.

That Is True.

01:24:02.867 --> 01:24:04.569
Skylar:<I>
The Truth Is,

01:24:04.601 --> 01:24:06.604
<I>I Think We Need A Little Fear
In Our Lives,

01:24:06.637 --> 01:24:08.039
<I>Because There's
No Better Feeling

01:24:08.071 --> 01:24:09.440
<I>Than Discovering

And So, In Conclusion,

01:24:59.789 --> 01:25:01.958
