10:20.432 --> 10:25.613
[music]

10:30.102 --> 10:33.521
It's more awkward than heavy.

10:33.522 --> 10:35.522
[whirring]

10:39.142 --> 10:40.431
Yuh-oh.

10:40.432 --> 10:43.681
Sorry, Lt. Valeria, we'll have
this out of your way in no time.

10:43.682 --> 10:46.521
Yeah, you will.
[laser shot]

10:46.522 --> 10:48.971
Pilots, to your fighters!

10:48.972 --> 10:50.731
Not good, not good, not good,

10:50.732 --> 10:52.799
not good, not good, not good,
not good, not...

10:56.142 --> 10:58.521
- You did it, Rowan!
- Where's Roger?

10:58.522 --> 11:01.731
[groans]
I built myself into this thing!

11:01.732 --> 11:03.273
[gasps]

11:03.562 --> 11:04.562
Hold on!

11:06.472 --> 11:07.561
Ready to fly?

11:07.562 --> 11:09.931
Roger!

11:09.932 --> 11:12.061
All right then.

11:12.062 --> 11:15.914
[whoosh]

11:16.102 --> 11:19.431
Um, weren't we supposed
to fly with Lt. Valeria?

11:19.432 --> 11:21.061
[beeping]

11:21.062 --> 11:23.141
This just went very, very wrong.

11:23.142 --> 11:25.471
Yeah.
Should be me in that cockpit.

11:25.472 --> 11:29.231
[blasters firing]

11:29.232 --> 11:33.231
- No! Stop!
- What's that?

11:33.232 --> 11:37.101
[lower voice] I said, "No stop till
we beat the Empire!"

11:37.102 --> 11:40.061
I like that attitude.

11:40.062 --> 11:42.431
She thinks you're an R6 unit,
so act like one!

11:42.432 --> 11:44.431
Fine!
Beep, boop.

11:44.432 --> 11:46.851
We're gonna die!
Boop!

11:46.852 --> 11:48.141
Lock down the attack vector.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.181
Um, attack vector locked down...

11:50.182 --> 11:52.931
like really, really good.

11:52.932 --> 11:55.681
We've got TIEs on our tail.
Take 'em out.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.521
Um, uh...
You got it!

11:57.522 --> 11:59.811
[music]

11:59.812 --> 12:03.681
Hey! Beep-boop!
Watch it, boop!

12:03.682 --> 12:05.681
Yeah!
Uh, uh, I mean...

12:05.682 --> 12:08.971
- Knocked those TIEs out of the sky!
- Then get set!

12:08.972 --> 12:10.601
We're going for the exhaust port.

12:10.602 --> 12:13.101
[music]

12:13.102 --> 12:15.891
We'll only get one shot at this.
Ready the proton bomb.

12:15.892 --> 12:18.311
Beep boop...
I-I didn't finish fixing that part.

12:18.312 --> 12:22.141
- Uh, boop?
- Thermal exhaust port in sight.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.771
Almost there...

12:23.772 --> 12:26.971
[rapid beeping]
Gotcha!

12:26.972 --> 12:29.471
We've got a malfunction
on the bomb release!

12:29.472 --> 12:31.231
Beep, beep!
It's stuck!

12:31.232 --> 12:34.311
- Boop!
- I got this.

12:34.312 --> 12:36.971
[rumbling]

12:36.972 --> 12:38.271
Come on!

12:48.102 --> 12:51.063
Ha ha!
That's what I like!

12:52.142 --> 12:58.271
[whirrs]

12:58.272 --> 13:02.311
Rowan Freemaker, the Force
is definitely with you.

13:02.346 --> 13:04.141
- Was it fun?
- So fun!

13:04.142 --> 13:07.351
I don't know what you did
back there, but great job.

13:07.352 --> 13:10.301
You keep a cool head
in a hot fight.

13:11.142 --> 13:13.677
What just happened?
[beeps]

13:15.140 --> 13:17.179
I know I could contribute,
Admiral Ackbar!

13:17.180 --> 13:18.180
Uh!

13:18.215 --> 13:20.559
- I'm sure you could.
- Ah!

13:20.560 --> 13:22.019
I'm... I'm a great pilot!
Whoa!

13:22.020 --> 13:26.479
They call me Zander Freemaker,
Superstar Pilot Guy!

13:26.480 --> 13:30.599
- I'm sure they do.
- Oh, so why don't I get to fly a fighter?

13:30.600 --> 13:33.809
- Woah!
- Good question. [whooshing]

13:33.810 --> 13:36.139
Why don't you ask
Lieutenant Valeria?

13:36.140 --> 13:40.000
Someone call Palpatine and tell
him he needs more TIE fighters. Ha!

13:40.173 --> 13:42.719
So all I have to do
is talk to her?

13:42.720 --> 13:44.179
I got this.

13:44.180 --> 13:47.389
- Hey! Lieutenant Valeria... I, uh...
- No.

13:47.390 --> 13:49.519
But I could contribute!
I'm a great pilot.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.559
They call me Zander Freemaker,

13:51.560 --> 13:53.389
<i>[muffled] Superstar Pilot Guy?</i>

13:53.390 --> 13:56.929
Kid, I couldn't let you fly in
my squadron even if I wanted to.

13:56.930 --> 13:59.269
We don't have any fighters to spare.

13:59.270 --> 14:02.429
Oh, Zander Freemaker
comes with his own ship.

14:02.430 --> 14:06.139
May I present the Blazemaker.

14:06.140 --> 14:09.179
Dual chromium plate engines.
A durasteel hull.

14:09.180 --> 14:12.219
And even a drink holder
in the cockpit. [slurps]

14:12.220 --> 14:14.929
Not bad.
But it's missing one thing.

14:14.930 --> 14:17.519
[slurps] I know.
I'm adding racing stripes next.

14:17.520 --> 14:21.059
No, kid. Blasters.
It has no blasters.

14:21.060 --> 14:24.156
Oh.
Is that, like, important?

14:24.191 --> 14:27.019
For a starfighter?
Very important.

14:27.020 --> 14:29.349
<i>Ackbar: The Empire's mounting

14:29.350 --> 14:30.429

Excuse me.
Are you Zander Freemaker,

14:37.350 --> 14:38.979
Take-No-For-An-Answer Guy?

14:38.980 --> 14:41.559
- No.
- That's right, you're not.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.679
So when they say
your ship isn't good enough

14:43.680 --> 14:47.269
- to fly with them, you say...
- I say...

14:47.270 --> 14:49.309
let's get building.

14:49.310 --> 14:53.724
[music]

14:56.020 --> 14:58.889
Ahh!

14:58.890 --> 14:59.890
Whoops!

15:03.140 --> 15:06.349
Ah!
[laughs]

15:06.350 --> 15:09.139
- So...
- Well...

15:09.140 --> 15:11.349
they can't say it
doesn't have blasters.

15:11.350 --> 15:13.219
No, they cannot.

15:13.220 --> 15:17.309
Do you think that maybe
we overdid it?

15:17.310 --> 15:21.389
Nope! Here comes, Zander
Freemaker, Superstar Pilot Guy!

15:21.390 --> 15:24.179

Without a doubt.

15:38.390 --> 15:41.666
[blasters firing]

15:44.980 --> 15:47.179
Blast! We lost Dobrez.

Whoo!

16:02.270 --> 16:04.349
[screaming]
Consider him shook.

16:04.350 --> 16:06.099
Shaken. Blazed.
Whatever it is.

16:06.100 --> 16:08.179
<i>Is that... the mechanic?</i>

16:08.180 --> 16:10.559
No, Lieutenant Valeria,

17:43.200 --> 17:46.369
We caused very few accidental
explosions yesterday.

17:46.370 --> 17:48.699
If you round down, none.

17:48.700 --> 17:51.749
Oh? Oh, yes.
Yes, very good, Freemakers.

17:51.750 --> 17:52.869

Admiral Ackbar, sir?
Is everything all right?

17:55.750 --> 17:57.999
No, I'm afraid it isn't.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.369
Two of our best agents are trapped
behind an Imperial Blockade.

18:01.370 --> 18:04.119
Their ship needs
a new Fuel Intermixer.

18:04.120 --> 18:07.959
But even if we had one, we have
no way of getting it to them.

18:07.960 --> 18:10.699
- [scoffs] Is that all?
- It'll be easy.

18:10.700 --> 18:13.699
Enjoy a caf.
We'll get that part to your agents.

18:13.700 --> 18:17.869

- [spits] Arrested?!

- And we found a home.

21:49.960 --> 21:54.329
