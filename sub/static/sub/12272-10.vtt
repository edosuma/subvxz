00:01.440 --> 00:05.870
You were at the strip club on
official business earlier in the day,

00:05.900 --> 00:08.039
But then you went back
on your own time later?

00:08.060 --> 00:10.540
I already told you, yes.

00:10.580 --> 00:13.200
And that's when you met the victim?

00:13.320 --> 00:16.110
Are you  any of this down?

00:16.540 --> 00:19.510
I first met Candy in the
parking lot the strip club.

00:19.550 --> 00:22.030
Later on, I talked to her inside.

00:24.020 --> 00:28.510
Approximately how much money did
you spend getting to know the victim?

00:28.550 --> 00:31.800
300 bucks, but that was because
it was part of an investigation.

00:31.820 --> 00:33.456
- And that would be the investigation

00:33.457 --> 00:35.091
the Under sheriff told you to drop?

00:35.092 --> 00:35.500
- Yes...

00:35.530 --> 00:39.010
You still on the
modafinil and thezolpidem?

00:39.040 --> 00:41.200
No, I’m off them.

00:41.510 --> 00:43.580
Did you take them yesterday?

00:47.090 --> 00:52.630
So, today is the first day of
the rest of your life,hmm?

00:55.810 --> 00:57.760
Dispatch said body at a dump.

00:57.780 --> 01:01.000
Yeah,this is definitely
not the city dump.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.640
Nick? Greg?

01:29.700 --> 01:32.440
Kids were out here drinking
beer, found the dead dogs.

01:32.470 --> 01:36.150
Patrol unit came, responded
and found the female DB.

01:36.180 --> 01:39.250
Looks like animal bites
on her arms and legs.

01:44.890 --> 01:47.340
No purse or ID on her.

01:47.370 --> 01:49.910
Okay,Dave,let's see what we got.

01:55.510 --> 01:57.920
Whatever bit her must have
been at it for a while.

01:57.940 --> 01:59.660
Yeah,maybe.

01:59.870 --> 02:02.650
But I doubt they tied
her up and beat her.

02:02.660 --> 02:07.900
Check out the contusions, ligature marks.

02:07.930 --> 02:11.440
Disposing of animals
like this is illegal.

02:11.540 --> 02:15.140
Whoever dumped the vic must have
known about the site from dumping dogs.

02:15.170 --> 02:16.710
Yup.

02:18.070 --> 02:21.260
It looks like he's
moving up the food chain.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.150
Hey.

03:31.180 --> 03:32.300
Hey,could you do me a favor?

03:32.340 --> 03:34.130
Um,bring me one of the swabs?

03:34.170 --> 03:35.250
Sure.

03:35.290 --> 03:37.080
What's up?

03:37.510 --> 03:40.050
There's some white trace
on the soles of her feet.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.080
You were at the scene.

03:41.120 --> 03:44.770
Did you happen to notice any white
material that might have transferred?

03:44.780 --> 03:47.510
Maybe. I can't say for sure.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.890
I mean, there were dead dogs
and trash all over the place.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.860
Excuse me.

03:55.330 --> 03:59.190
- Would you help me remove her dress?
- Sure.

03:59.220 --> 04:00.960
Let's just roll her.

04:08.220 --> 04:09.490
That look like a needle mark?

04:09.520 --> 04:12.080
I'll send samples to Tox.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.950
******

04:15.970 --> 04:18.959
So,in the course of
developing this informant,

04:18.980 --> 04:23.200
You took her to a motel
and had sex with her?

04:23.230 --> 04:25.260
That part was personal.

04:25.300 --> 04:31.600
CSI Brown, in your mind, is there any
distinction between personal and official?

04:31.640 --> 04:33.740
Have you guys bothered
to call the motel?

04:33.750 --> 04:35.760
I checked in with a credit card.

04:35.790 --> 04:38.420
I checked out around 5:00.

04:38.440 --> 04:39.670
I called a cab.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.960
Talk to the cab driver.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.310
When I woke up, Candy was gone.

04:44.320 --> 04:48.310
When I got back to the cb to
pick up my car, she was dead.

04:50.260 --> 04:52.520
No!

04:52.560 --> 04:54.340
Listen to me.

04:54.370 --> 04:56.920
I did not kill her.

04:57.010 --> 04:59.810
But I know damn well who did.

05:05.470 --> 05:08.120
Lou Gedda to see you, Captain.

05:16.810 --> 05:17.710
What's this?

05:17.740 --> 05:19.630
Candy's mother's phone number.

05:19.670 --> 05:21.280
Her parents have already been notified.

05:21.300 --> 05:25.360
Candy wrote it down for me
last night just before she died.

05:25.390 --> 05:28.720
That's why she came back
to the club after her shift.

05:28.750 --> 05:30.850
Her mother was pressuring her to quit.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.880
Candy wanted me to call
her, give her the talk.

05:33.910 --> 05:36.950
It's exotic dancing, not stripping.

05:36.980 --> 05:38.570
Show business.

05:38.590 --> 05:40.250
Did you make the call?

05:40.290 --> 05:43.940
I don't get involved in family business,

05:43.970 --> 05:46.310
But I thought it might
help your investigation.

05:46.340 --> 05:47.550
How's this going to help me?

05:47.580 --> 05:49.660
How should I know?

05:49.680 --> 05:52.860
I'm just trying to be a good citizen.

05:56.360 --> 05:57.720
- Hey,Doc.
- Hey.

05:57.750 --> 06:00.670
I heard your band killed last night.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.160
Really? Who'd you hear that from?

06:02.190 --> 06:03.560
My wife's second cousin.

06:03.590 --> 06:04.935
Works in the mayor's office for

06:04.936 --> 06:06.410
the budget and finance director.

06:06.440 --> 06:07.960
He was at the country club.

06:07.990 --> 06:09.840
Grooved to your moldy oldies all night.

06:09.860 --> 06:11.280
They're classics.

06:11.310 --> 06:12.220
Sorry.

06:12.250 --> 06:15.640
So,uh,people were talking about me?

06:19.930 --> 06:21.460
What did I do?

06:21.490 --> 06:24.140
I know her. Her name's
Elizabeth Rodriguez.

06:24.180 --> 06:26.610
She and her husband
Felix were honored last

06:26.611 --> 06:29.040
night by the Nevada
Enterprise Association.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.710
Humanitarians of the Year.

06:30.760 --> 06:33.600
They opened that outreach
center in the Alphabets.

06:33.630 --> 06:35.420
They were dancing right in front of me.

06:40.740 --> 06:42.560
She and Felix were very philanthropic.

06:42.580 --> 06:44.760
I admired both of them.

06:44.970 --> 06:46.830
Did they leave the party together?

06:46.860 --> 06:48.990
No. He left first.

06:58.180 --> 06:59.940
Do you remember what time that was?

06:59.980 --> 07:04.020
Sometime between "Louie
Louie" and "You Really Got Me. "

07:04.050 --> 07:05.500
Could you be more specific,Doc?

07:05.520 --> 07:07.800
Well, it was just before
the end of our third set.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.980
We broke at 10:00.

07:10.010 --> 07:11.310
Just before that

07:11.320 --> 07:12.640
And she stayed?

07:12.670 --> 07:14.200
For a little while.

07:26.750 --> 07:29.070
I didn't see her after that.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.100
Guess it was around 10:30.

07:31.130 --> 07:33.720
And the kids called in
the dead dogs around 2:00.

07:33.740 --> 07:36.410
So, that’s a
three-And-A-Half-Hour window.

07:36.440 --> 07:37.720
I'll talk to the husband.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.080
I'll keep you posted.

07:39.130 --> 07:40.800
Thank you.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.820
Can you tell me anything
about these bites?

07:42.860 --> 07:45.000
Definitely perimortem.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.110
Right around time of death.

07:47.150 --> 07:48.710
So, it’s unlikely it's coyotes.

07:48.750 --> 07:50.490
No.

07:52.670 --> 07:54.840
Are you going to be okay with this one?

07:55.020 --> 07:58.490
I'm just not used to seeing them alive.

08:02.710 --> 08:04.570
You went home without your wife. Why?

08:04.600 --> 08:07.910
I hate dry chicken and small talk.

08:07.950 --> 08:10.650
And more than anything, I hate dancing.

08:10.700 --> 08:13.080
So, I went home, and I
passed out on the couch.

08:13.110 --> 08:17.050
Next thing I know, you guys
are banging on my front door.

08:17.390 --> 08:18.110
Where's Liz?

08:18.150 --> 08:21.110
Do you always leave your
wife on the dance floor?

08:21.160 --> 08:24.680
Liz is out every night at some
charitable function, saving the world.

08:24.710 --> 08:25.840
We have a deal.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.220
If I make an appearance, I
get to duck out early.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.840
You know what? I've done my
time. I think I'm going home.

08:32.870 --> 08:35.370
All right,well,don't wait up for me.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.980
And I'll miss you.

08:41.220 --> 08:42.919
Look, if you don't tell me what's going

08:42.919 --> 08:44.530
on, I’ll need to talk to my lawyer.

08:44.540 --> 08:47.950
Your wife was murdered last night.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.850
Mr. Rodriguez, this is CSI Sanders.

08:58.890 --> 09:00.222
He's here to take your

09:00.223 --> 09:02.160
fingerprints and your clothes.

09:02.190 --> 09:03.860
Please stand up.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.600
What?

09:05.640 --> 09:08.980
Mr. Rodriguez, stand up.

09:09.010 --> 09:10.470
I want to see my wife.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.460
When we're finished
here, we’ll talk about it.

09:12.490 --> 09:14.710
Stand up, please.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.280
I didn't kill her.

09:24.210 --> 09:26.700
I loved my wife.

10:03.410 --> 10:06.120
****driven him home.

10:06.140 --> 10:08.180
I have to trust the
people I work with, Jim.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.312
Look,Warrick's a loose

10:09.313 --> 10:10.740
cannon. We both know that.

10:10.780 --> 10:12.310
He was in Gedda's strip club...

10:12.340 --> 10:13.120
He was off the clock.

10:13.150 --> 10:15.030
Conducting his own police investigation.

10:15.060 --> 10:17.380
He's very passionate about this case.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.238
Yeah,passionate enough to sleep with

10:19.239 --> 10:21.230
the Vic who ended up dead in his car.

10:21.280 --> 10:24.060
Look, I know Warrick didn't
have anything to do with it,

10:24.070 --> 10:27.280
But he needs to back off.

10:29.380 --> 10:31.950
Guys like Lou Gedda-They don't skip

10:31.951 --> 10:34.960
on murder and extortion by being lucky.

10:37.500 --> 10:38.880
What does that mean?

10:38.920 --> 10:42.360
You think Gedda's got
"friends” inside the department?

10:42.400 --> 10:45.670
Well, unlike Warrick,I don't make

10:45.671 --> 10:48.940
accusations until I have proof.

11:00.020 --> 11:01.780
Hey,Grissom.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.310
Did you talk to IA yet?

11:04.360 --> 11:06.650
Yeah. They cleared me.

11:06.690 --> 11:08.560
They didn't seem to have
much interest in Gedda.

11:08.590 --> 11:10.000
That's because it wasn't about Gedda.

11:10.020 --> 11:10.820
It was about you.

11:10.850 --> 11:12.220
It's everything to do with Gedda.

11:12.250 --> 11:13.840
Sending me a message.

11:13.860 --> 11:17.790
Murders an innocent young
girl because I got too close to them.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.870
I want this case,Gris.

11:19.910 --> 11:22.660
I hope you know that's not gonna happen.

11:22.980 --> 11:26.610
You're in the rotation
as of tomorrow, so go home.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.010
The white flaky trace on your
victim's feet was permethrin,

11:37.050 --> 11:40.540
An insect repellent, also
used in flea dips.

11:40.570 --> 11:43.020
She was found with a bunch of dead dogs.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.490
What about the husband's tux?

11:44.520 --> 11:47.400
No flea dip, no dog hairs, no blood.

11:47.430 --> 11:50.950
Just a little bit of champagne and
some underarm deodorant.

11:50.980 --> 11:53.970
You just exonerated our only suspect.

11:59.500 --> 12:02.020
So how crazy was last night?

12:02.050 --> 12:04.480
You. Me. Dinner?

12:04.800 --> 12:06.640
I thought the Syrah was quite nice.

12:06.670 --> 12:09.930
Yes, and thank you for
offering to split the check.

12:09.970 --> 12:12.370
My date really appreciated it.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.560
Oh,no problem.

12:13.600 --> 12:18.300
Let it be known, that I am
nothing if not a gentleman.

12:19.850 --> 12:23.300
Why were you at a restaurant
like Nob Hillby yourself anyway?

12:23.310 --> 12:24.800
The Golden Rule.

12:24.830 --> 12:27.700
Always treat yourself the way you
would like others to treat you.

12:27.720 --> 12:30.690
That's not exactly the rule.

12:30.730 --> 12:31.550
What are you working on?

12:31.580 --> 12:33.490
The Elizabeth Rodriguez homicide.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.840
She had bite marks on
her with saliva in them,

12:35.870 --> 12:37.820
And the saliva turned out to be canine,

12:37.860 --> 12:40.620
And anytime a dog is
impounded in a criminal case,

12:40.650 --> 12:43.590
Its DNA is collected and profiled.

12:43.620 --> 12:45.890
It's just like CODIS.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.330
DODIS.

12:48.740 --> 12:50.970
Anyway most of the cases in
the database are gang-Related.

12:51.010 --> 12:53.050
But I figured,well,it's worth a shot.

12:53.080 --> 12:56.620
Well, that’ll look good on
the old Grissom point meter.

12:59.030 --> 13:01.130
It's protocol.

13:01.180 --> 13:07.100
I'm just saying, be careful:
no one likes a kiss-Ass.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.740
Really?

13:43.570 --> 13:45.940
Hey,Nick,have you seen Catherine?

13:45.980 --> 13:47.340
Yeah,she got another call-Out.

13:47.380 --> 13:49.520
We're a little bit shorthanded
right now. What's up?

13:49.540 --> 13:52.340
The canine DNA database
got a hit on the saliva.

13:52.370 --> 13:54.820
It's a pit bull named Hannibal.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.142
Confiscated during a drug raid at

13:57.143 --> 13:58.530
a gang house three months ago.

13:58.570 --> 14:00.999
And then held at Del Santos Kennel until

14:01.000 --> 14:03.610
he was released to
his owner,Gino Aquino.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.590
A member of the D Street Killers.

14:06.770 --> 14:09.110
Rodriguez Outreach
Center is on D Street.

14:09.160 --> 14:10.190
Well, you do good work
in that neighborhood,

14:10.210 --> 14:13.200
And you're bound to piss off the DSKs.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.200
Maybe enough to want her dead.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.550
Go see everyone's ID.

14:28.220 --> 14:30.670
Fine, do your cop thing
and don't tell me nothing'.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.270
Go ahead, look around all you want.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.880
Keep an eye on him.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.450
My dog ain't here.

14:35.490 --> 14:37.000
You arrested him with
me a couple months ago.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.800
I never got him back.

14:39.090 --> 14:40.980
Well,Mr. Aquino*********

14:41.000 --> 14:42.660
Quítese los zapatos!

14:42.670 --> 14:45.170
Lo siento pero est? Prohibido.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.587
Look, you or any of your homies hang

14:46.588 --> 14:48.090
out at the Rodriguez Outreach Center?

14:48.120 --> 14:49.633
Yeah,right. A bunch
of rich people trying

14:49.634 --> 14:50.750
to feel good about themselves.

14:50.780 --> 14:52.490
They should just give us the money.

15:53.820 --> 15:56.680
I thought you said your dog's
been gone for a couple months now.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.580
Yeah,check the police report.

15:58.620 --> 15:59.882
Then why do you have a bowl of

15:59.883 --> 16:01.480
fresh water for him out in the shed?

16:01.530 --> 16:03.060
In case he comes back.

16:03.110 --> 16:04.390
And the leashes?

16:04.430 --> 16:06.510
I'm still in mourning.

16:08.580 --> 16:09.790
What about the treadmill?

16:09.840 --> 16:11.240
You crazy? I bought that for her.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.090
Eh,no me metas en esto.

16:13.110 --> 16:14.930
Cállate,ya!

16:14.960 --> 16:16.400
Do I need to tap my defender?

16:16.450 --> 16:19.110
Tell him to meet you downtown.

16:19.460 --> 16:22.390
Voy a la cárcelporque estas muy
ocupado comiendo y no limpias.

16:22.420 --> 16:26.350
Mm-Mm,como porque tuno llenas
mis necesidades emocionales,okay?

16:26.370 --> 16:28.260
Ah,pegame. Vas a ver.

16:28.300 --> 16:29.450
Vete de aqu?

16:29.480 --> 16:32.540
So I'm offering a $100,000
reward for any information

16:32.550 --> 16:36.040
Leading to the arrest and
conviction of my wife's killer.

16:36.070 --> 16:39.660
I will not rest until the murderer
is caught and brought to justice.

16:39.690 --> 16:42.190
I know government employees
aren't eligible for reward money,

16:42.210 --> 16:44.790
But I think we should at
least get a small percentage.

16:44.810 --> 16:46.330
It's called your salary.

16:46.360 --> 16:47.220
What have you got?

16:47.230 --> 16:50.110
Possible COD on Elizabeth Rodriguez.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.420
Overdose.

16:53.120 --> 16:56.940
Phenytoin and pentobarbital.

16:56.970 --> 17:00.010
An anti-Epilepticand
a sedative hypnotic?

17:00.040 --> 17:03.550
In combination,they're
used to euthanize animals.

17:03.650 --> 17:08.319
Dog bites, mass dog
grave,euthanizing solution.

17:08.980 --> 17:11.030
Well, those drugs are
controlled substances,

17:11.060 --> 17:12.710
So their sales should be registered.

17:12.730 --> 17:16.849
Already put together a list of
the buyers in the Las Vegas area.

17:20.470 --> 17:22.960
Del Santos Kennel.

17:27.510 --> 17:29.720
Yeah,Nicky,where are you?

17:34.000 --> 17:36.140
Elizabeth Rodriguez.

17:36.210 --> 17:37.130
She was friends with the owner.

17:37.150 --> 17:38.710
She bankrolled the place.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.900
Her old man's rich.

17:41.860 --> 17:44.090
We need to see your
controlled substances;

17:44.140 --> 17:49.200
Any records you have on a
confiscated dog named Hannibal;

17:49.220 --> 17:51.800
And I'll have to print
everyone who works here.

17:51.830 --> 17:52.680
All right, no problem.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.350
The owner's got the key to the cabinet.

17:54.370 --> 17:56.730
His name's Steve Card.
He's just down the hall.

17:56.770 --> 17:58.030
Anybody else have access?

17:58.070 --> 18:00.500
Uh,no,I have the only key.

18:00.940 --> 18:02.800
Are you a licensed veterinian?

18:02.830 --> 18:04.120
Vet tech.

18:04.150 --> 18:07.210
Oh,I didn't realize that techs
were allowed to perform surgeries.

18:07.240 --> 18:10.210
Not on live animals, but once the
dog dies I can harvest the organs.

18:10.250 --> 18:14.120
I sell the hearts to research
labs doing heartworm studies.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.390
It's a rescue kennel.

18:15.430 --> 18:18.760
Most the dogs who come in
are problematic, aggressive.

18:18.780 --> 18:21.000
Most don't make it out.

18:21.340 --> 18:24.950
Mr. Card, I’m going to have
to ask you to step outside

18:24.980 --> 18:26.900
So I can take your statement.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.510
What do you think that is?

19:16.540 --> 19:18.470
I don't know.

19:18.530 --> 19:20.627
But the pattern on these restraints is

19:20.628 --> 19:23.110
consistent to ligature
marks on the victim.

19:23.140 --> 19:26.800
I found a hidden camera
pointing right at it.

19:27.210 --> 19:29.530
It's an awful lot of blood.

19:34.950 --> 19:37.340
Long red hairs.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.080
I don't think these came from a dog.

19:51.610 --> 19:53.400
Wait, what is he being arrested for?

19:53.450 --> 19:54.840
Murder.

19:54.870 --> 19:56.090
Who got murdered?

19:56.120 --> 19:57.980
Mrs. Rodriguez.

19:58.310 --> 20:00.403
Do you have any idea
what that contraption's

20:00.404 --> 20:02.310
used for in the back storage room there?

20:02.360 --> 20:03.710
Um,I'm not allowed back there.

20:03.750 --> 20:06.450
I just pick up the
poop and walk the dogs.

20:07.310 --> 20:09.640
It says here you released
the dog back to its owner,

20:09.670 --> 20:12.690
But Mr. Aquino claims he
never got Hannibal back.

20:12.710 --> 20:14.230
That's not true.

20:14.260 --> 20:16.820
I was here when he picked Hannibal up.

20:16.850 --> 20:18.820
How many dogs you got here?

20:18.840 --> 20:20.420
Like 47 right now.

20:20.460 --> 20:23.380
I'm gonna need to collect
saliva samples from all of them.

20:24.010 --> 20:27.070
Most of these guys are pretty jacked up.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.980
Ooh,yeah,looks like he's
been in a few fights.

20:34.030 --> 20:36.060
Yeah,most of them have.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.890
You can go ahead. He's
not gonna bother you.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.850
Must get pretty tough working here,huh?

20:45.880 --> 20:48.900
Yeah,you try to make a difference.

20:48.950 --> 20:50.354
I spent some time in a

20:50.355 --> 20:52.460
cage, so I know what it's like.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.000
Yeah,you're a good boy.

20:55.010 --> 20:57.000
You're a good boy.

20:57.780 --> 21:01.200
It's okay,boy. It's okay.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.680
You got any print
results from off my car?

21:19.710 --> 21:21.010
Should I be talking to you?

21:21.040 --> 21:23.020
Yeah,I've been cleared.

21:23.050 --> 21:26.390
Well,no,actually all I
got so far are your prints.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.590
Wait,I got something.

21:38.570 --> 21:40.490
I know that guy.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.240
****talk to you

21:43.280 --> 21:44.850
****

21:52.750 --> 21:54.930
His name is Richard Dorsey.

21:55.810 --> 21:57.057
You know, you keep pursuing

21:57.058 --> 21:58.950
this, you’re going to end up suspended.

21:58.980 --> 22:00.710
Dorsey's prints were found inside

22:00.711 --> 22:02.440
my car under the broken window.

22:02.470 --> 22:05.000
Well, that’s consistent with him
putting the body in your car.

22:05.020 --> 22:06.320
Grissom,he's a homeless guy.

22:06.350 --> 22:08.780
He lives in the alley
behind the strip club.

22:08.810 --> 22:10.800
Don't you get it? He's Gedda's fall guy.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.970
This is a frame job.

22:13.940 --> 22:17.550
Okay, I’ll have Brass check it out.

22:17.580 --> 22:19.550
You stay out of it, though.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.710
We've got the victim's
blood and hair at your kennel.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.682
She died of an overdose
of the same drugs

22:27.683 --> 22:29.420
that were found in a medicine cabinet

22:29.460 --> 22:31.370
That only you had access to.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.800
If I were you, I’d save my
money and start talking.

22:34.840 --> 22:37.860
Are you acting as his lawyer now?

22:38.970 --> 22:42.830
Mr. Card, I found this hidden
camera in the exam room.

22:42.860 --> 22:44.490
Where's the receiver?

22:44.520 --> 22:46.120
I don't know anything about this.

22:46.140 --> 22:48.510
Did you forget about the camera
when you killed Elizabeth Rodriguez?

22:48.530 --> 22:50.540
I didn't kill Lizzie. She
was my business partner.

22:50.580 --> 22:52.150
I'm advising you to stop talking.

22:52.180 --> 22:54.250
It's not your ass.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.500
I'm a victim here.

22:56.730 --> 22:58.050
How do you figure?

22:59.090 --> 23:02.830
It was on the morning
news that Lizzie was dead.

23:02.900 --> 23:05.090
And when I came into work...

23:15.090 --> 23:18.850
So instead of calling the police,

23:18.860 --> 23:20.550
You cleaned up the crime scene.

23:20.610 --> 23:21.930
That makes you an accessory.

23:21.970 --> 23:23.510
He was afraid for his life.

23:23.560 --> 23:27.640
Nobody cheats the D Street
Killers out of 50 Gs and lives.

23:27.670 --> 23:30.150
You cheated them out of $50,000?

23:30.180 --> 23:31.690
Not me.

23:31.720 --> 23:32.960
Lizzie.

23:33.380 --> 23:35.350
We banked 50 Gs.

23:35.390 --> 23:37.530
I bet Gino's getting sick of losing.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.160
It never fails.

23:40.930 --> 23:44.490
When I fight a dog, I fight to win.

23:44.750 --> 23:49.370
Lizzie was the #1 dog
fighter in all of Vegas.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.414
That drove Gino nuts’ cause he was like

23:51.415 --> 23:53.790
this close to knocking
her off the top spot.

23:53.820 --> 23:55.638
You seriously want us to believe that

23:55.639 --> 23:57.750
Mrs. Rodriguez,
humanitarian of the year,

23:57.770 --> 23:58.870
Was into dog fighting?

23:58.890 --> 24:01.280
Oh,she was no Mother Theresa.

24:01.310 --> 24:05.600
But,see,she'd still be alive if
she wasn't a dirty dog fighter.

24:05.610 --> 24:09.350
That rub, it made the other dog sick.

24:09.380 --> 24:11.720
Gee, I hate to see the
sport tainted like that.

24:11.750 --> 24:14.430
Why do you think she gave
money to my rescue kennel?

24:14.460 --> 24:19.080
She didn't even like dogs, but
fighting them, that was in her blood.

24:19.100 --> 24:21.174
Passed down from her daddy who

24:21.175 --> 24:23.870
taught her the whole family business.

24:23.950 --> 24:26.550
Okay... what is this?

24:30.890 --> 24:34.760
It's a... it's a breeding stand.

24:35.010 --> 24:37.980
The sport has a high mortality rate,

24:37.990 --> 24:41.840
And,uh,combative bitches
won't breed without a fight.

24:41.870 --> 24:46.820
So we have to tie them
down to consummate the act.

24:47.010 --> 24:49.880
The victim was tied to that stand.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.160
That's sick.

24:55.990 --> 24:58.230
My client's willing
to give you everything.

24:58.260 --> 24:59.320
What's "everything"?

24:59.360 --> 25:02.638
My client cleaned up the scene, but

25:02.639 --> 25:06.010
he didn't dispose of the evidence.

25:07.300 --> 25:10.430
We can also give you Gino Aquino.

26:33.540 --> 26:35.940
LVPD! Police! Freeze!

26:35.970 --> 26:36.910
Nadie se mueve!

26:36.950 --> 26:37.910
Manos arriba!

26:37.940 --> 26:39.640
Hands in the air!

26:55.100 --> 26:56.290
I give up! I give up!

26:56.310 --> 26:58.270
On ground, now!

26:58.340 --> 26:59.820
Freeze!

26:59.850 --> 27:02.890
Don't even think about it.

27:03.260 --> 27:06.700
Let me guess. ****dog?

27:12.570 --> 27:14.580
Hey,what's going to happen
to all these dogs now?

27:14.600 --> 27:16.520
They'll have to be put down.

27:16.860 --> 27:19.010
Law says they're dangerous.

27:19.030 --> 27:20.310
And the people who
turn them into killers,

27:20.340 --> 27:22.260
They just get away with
a slap on the wrist,huh?

27:22.300 --> 27:24.680
It's not illegal to train them to fight.

27:27.170 --> 27:29.880
Well, it should be.

27:40.140 --> 27:42.450
Get away from my house.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.440
Sorry.

27:46.280 --> 27:47.760
Grissom.

27:48.840 --> 27:50.590
All these guys know Dorsey.

27:50.620 --> 27:52.480
This is where he lives.

28:10.490 --> 28:11.940
Hey,Mitch.

28:14.050 --> 28:15.420
That's him.

28:15.830 --> 28:18.350
Richard Dorsey, time to wake up.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.100
You're under arrest.

28:28.430 --> 28:29.890
Methead.

28:31.450 --> 28:32.760
No weapons.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.370
He's clean.

28:34.660 --> 28:36.510
All right,****

28:49.310 --> 28:52.200
Pulled this bullet out
of Mr. Aquino's shoulder.

28:52.350 --> 28:54.620
It looks like a like. 25 caliber.

28:54.660 --> 28:56.640
That's friendly fire.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.230
Thanks,Doc.

29:02.020 --> 29:03.470
My arm ain't never
gonna work right again.

29:03.500 --> 29:04.780
I'm gonna sull your asses.

29:04.820 --> 29:06.280
No,no,no,it was a. 25 caliber

29:06.281 --> 29:07.790
slug they pulled out of you.

29:07.820 --> 29:09.150
It means it was one of your boys.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.730
It was probably some cop’s backup.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.000
Yeah,that's probably it.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.580
Ya basta,Gino.

29:14.630 --> 29:16.930
We have witness who
says you killed Elizabeth

29:16.931 --> 29:19.330
Rodriguez because she
cheated you out of 50 Gs.

29:19.370 --> 29:21.730
Let me guess: you been
talking to Steve Card.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.670
Little screamer.

29:23.740 --> 29:26.490
That finger's pointing the other way.

29:27.010 --> 29:28.530
Lizzie had cojones.

29:28.580 --> 29:29.890
I loved that woman.

29:29.920 --> 29:31.300
I respected her.

29:31.330 --> 29:34.160
You never cross
Lizzie,she'll cut 'em off.

29:34.480 --> 29:37.880
But Card,he thought he had that
immunity idol’ cause he worked for her.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.910
Tonto.

29:44.400 --> 29:47.720
You cheating little bitch.
You been doing this all night?

29:48.410 --> 29:53.820
If I ever catch you cheating again, I
will feed your heart to that dog.

29:54.230 --> 29:55.920
That last fight wasn't on the up.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.640
Next dog's not right
either. You forfeit.

29:59.210 --> 30:02.600
Without her, he was nobody.

30:02.630 --> 30:04.930
She was a bad bitch.

30:04.970 --> 30:07.250
That's your motive.

30:07.800 --> 30:10.470
Anything else you need help with?

30:11.400 --> 30:13.599
Tell me about all the dead dogs

30:13.600 --> 30:16.010
I found down the Silverado Wash.

30:16.240 --> 30:17.740
Were you the one that tortured them?

30:17.790 --> 30:19.650
Made them fight?

30:19.680 --> 30:21.648
When they died, were you the one that

30:21.649 --> 30:23.350
threw them out with the trash?

30:24.430 --> 30:26.220
Was that you?

30:26.260 --> 30:28.120
I thought this was about Lizzi

30:28.160 --> 30:30.628
One way or another,Gi,you're not going

30:30.629 --> 30:33.160
to see the streets for quite a while.

30:36.290 --> 30:39.180
You know, there are two
things a jury can’t:

30:39.210 --> 30:41.460
People who abuse kids and
people who abuse animals.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.560
So Buena suerte.

30:46.610 --> 30:48.680
Classic he said/he said.

30:48.710 --> 30:51.160
Steve card was the only
one with access to the drugs

30:51.190 --> 30:53.160
And he admitted to
cleaning up the crime scene.

30:53.190 --> 30:54.630
There's no forced entry at the kennel.

30:54.660 --> 30:56.410
He has no alibi.

30:56.460 --> 30:59.080
And why would he give us all
of Elizabeth's personal effects?

30:59.110 --> 31:00.551
You know, I’m starting to get the

31:00.552 --> 31:02.560
feeling the guy's not
really all that smart.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.360
He has a good lawyer.

31:04.390 --> 31:06.208
Realized that we were
onto his client and

31:06.209 --> 31:07.680
wanted to throw us off the scent.

31:07.710 --> 31:10.550
Well, maybe Gino's telling the truth.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.564
Problem is, we don't have enough

31:12.565 --> 31:15.080
evidence to convict either one of them.

31:15.610 --> 31:20.210
One pair of woman's shoes, size 7,silver.

31:20.250 --> 31:23.115
Swabbed a blood sample from the instep

31:23.116 --> 31:25.830
of the right shoe, sent it to DNA.

31:25.890 --> 31:28.610
One woman's handbag, also silver.

31:28.630 --> 31:32.304
Contents include one tube of

31:32.305 --> 31:36.110
Superla Red lipstick #36...

31:36.610 --> 31:39.280
One mirrored compact...

31:40.890 --> 31:43.810
One set of keys holdings.

31:43.840 --> 31:47.838
Four- No, five
keys-One Mercedes

31:47.839 --> 31:51.230
key, one Schlage brass key.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.419
Steve Card was lying when he said he was

32:22.420 --> 32:24.410
the only one with the
key to the drug cabinet.

32:24.420 --> 32:25.830
Elizabeth had one, too.

32:25.870 --> 32:27.740
Means the killer could
have used her key.

32:27.770 --> 32:29.200
Got a print.

32:34.530 --> 32:35.260
Nick.

32:35.310 --> 32:36.270
Hey.

32:36.310 --> 32:37.750
We,uh,we can't really talk to him yet.

32:37.780 --> 32:39.010
He's still waiting for his lawyer.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.530
- He's waiting for me.
- Hmm?

32:41.570 --> 32:43.790
He's confidential informant.

32:43.820 --> 32:45.546
The DA's investigating Steve

32:45.547 --> 32:47.950
Card,Gino Aquino,Elizabeth Rodriguez,

32:47.970 --> 32:50.060
Everybody associated
with the dog fighting ring.

32:50.080 --> 32:52.460
So you knew about this?

32:52.480 --> 32:55.910
Knowing about it and proving
it are two different things.

32:55.940 --> 32:57.410
Okay.

32:57.970 --> 32:59.830
Okay, so what's this guy's story?

32:59.880 --> 33:01.300
Same
old- He...

33:01.340 --> 33:03.246
Used to ride with the D-Streeters,shot

33:03.247 --> 33:04.700
his old man when he was 15,

33:04.750 --> 33:07.420
Did four years in juvie,got
out, tried to turn his life around.

33:07.460 --> 33:10.300
We busted him 18 months ago
for possession and assault.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.650
He cut a deal.

33:11.680 --> 33:14.220
So he's got a history of violence.

33:14.260 --> 33:17.300
You think he killed Mrs. Rodriguez?

33:17.410 --> 33:19.070
It took me over a year to get

33:19.071 --> 33:21.130
him inside that dog fighting ring.

33:21.170 --> 33:23.310
I'm reserving judgment.

33:27.680 --> 33:29.250
I did the best that I could.

33:29.280 --> 33:30.610
I'm sure you did, Tommy.

33:30.650 --> 33:32.160
And I told you what they were doing to

33:32.161 --> 33:33.830
those dogs and I gave you all the tapes.

33:33.850 --> 33:35.290
It wasn't enough.

33:35.320 --> 33:38.280
We needed to see the dogs
fighting; that's the felony.

33:38.310 --> 33:40.610
But they had the fights
in different places.

33:40.640 --> 33:43.830
I mean, she never told me
where they were,s-So...

33:43.910 --> 33:47.240
Tommy, did you kill Elizabeth Rodriguez?

33:48.050 --> 33:51.080
I,I could understand if you did.

33:51.930 --> 33:55.900
A whole lot of people that
would say she had it coming.

34:01.320 --> 34:05.580
You know, I’ve been on
the streets... in juvie.

34:05.620 --> 34:08.117
I've seen people do some bad things

34:08.118 --> 34:10.969
to each other, but those dogs, like...

34:11.230 --> 34:13.570
You can beat their brains in and,

34:13.610 --> 34:14.998
Like, a minute later they come up

34:15.000 --> 34:16.429
to you just wagging their tails.

34:16.449 --> 34:19.389
I know, man. That's how they are.

34:19.949 --> 34:22.210
I always had dogs growing up.

34:22.250 --> 34:24.050
Did you?

34:24.520 --> 34:27.409
No, I never had a pet.
My mom was allergic.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.949
No, but you really cared about
those dogs at the kennel.

34:30.980 --> 34:32.389
Now, I know.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.020
I saw the way you treated them.

34:35.100 --> 34:37.590
Do you know how they train them?

34:39.449 --> 34:41.889
They'd run them till they dropped.

34:42.570 --> 34:44.870
They'd strengthen their jaws.

34:44.909 --> 34:50.620
Then, they would feed them
little dogs, sometimes cats...

34:50.920 --> 34:53.469
Just to give them the taste of blood.

34:53.510 --> 34:58.410
And I showed you what she did and
you did nothing to stop her.

34:58.710 --> 35:02.130
No. No, but you did.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.830
Didn't you?

35:09.940 --> 35:12.870
She was fighting dogs.
All right, she was...

35:12.900 --> 35:15.393
She was killing dogs in the

35:15.394 --> 35:18.440
ring for money week after week.

35:18.470 --> 35:22.840
And the city decides
to give her an award?

35:24.540 --> 35:27.540
I gave her what she really deserved.

36:07.450 --> 36:10.334
At least I had the decency to euthanize

36:10.335 --> 36:13.070
her before I threw her to the dogs.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.330
Well, you don't look like a
guy who just got a confession.

36:23.360 --> 36:26.180
Oh... something's still bugging me.

36:26.210 --> 36:28.206
If Mr. Rodriguez hadn't left the

36:28.207 --> 36:30.700
party, Elizabeth might still be alive.

36:30.730 --> 36:33.100
You think he would have
gone to the kennel with her?

36:33.160 --> 36:35.516
I don't know, but he
received a phone call from

36:35.517 --> 36:37.970
somebody that night that
made him leave his wife.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.080
Check the phone records.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.420
Mr. Rodriguez.

36:46.450 --> 36:47.310
¿Tienes tiempo?

36:47.350 --> 36:49.710
Detective Vega,Mr. Stokes.

36:49.740 --> 36:51.700
Did you catch the man
who killed my wife?

36:51.740 --> 36:52.910
Yes, sir.

36:52.950 --> 36:54.160
Tommy Halpert.

36:54.190 --> 36:56.010
We have him in custody now.

36:56.030 --> 36:57.763
Hey, witnesses at the party said that you

36:57.764 --> 36:59.800
received a phone call
the night of the murder

36:59.820 --> 37:01.920
And then you just left.

37:01.950 --> 37:04.780
We know that phone call
was from Tommy Halpert.

37:10.850 --> 37:13.280
What'd you two talk about?

37:14.190 --> 37:17.620
Tommy said if I didn't speak
to my wife that night, he would.

37:17.660 --> 37:20.290
Speak to your wife about what?

37:20.420 --> 37:22.600
The dog fighting.

37:22.620 --> 37:24.870
He showed me the tapes.

37:30.990 --> 37:33.290
What did Elizabeth say
when you confronted her?

37:33.320 --> 37:34.610
I didn't.

37:34.650 --> 37:36.270
So you just left her there,

37:36.290 --> 37:39.240
Knowing that Tommy was
going to come after her?

37:39.670 --> 37:42.330
Violence begets violence.

37:43.240 --> 37:45.250
Is that all?

37:46.640 --> 37:49.280
You let this happen.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.240
You did.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.060
Hey,you still with me, Richard?

37:59.100 --> 38:00.670
Yeah,yeah,yeah.

38:00.710 --> 38:02.090
Remember her?

38:02.120 --> 38:04.120
She worked at Pigalle.

38:04.130 --> 38:05.530
They all look the same to me.

38:05.540 --> 38:08.920
No, they don't. There's
blondes,brunettes,B-Cups,D-Cups.

38:08.960 --> 38:11.270
How about a cup of coffee,huh?

38:11.300 --> 38:13.340
Hey,you got a cigarette
I could bum off you?

38:13.380 --> 38:15.000
It's bad for your health.
How about a diet soda?

38:15.030 --> 38:16.900
Diet? No. No diet.

38:16.940 --> 38:19.090
I need the ups.

38:19.310 --> 38:21.390
Where did you get this?

38:24.060 --> 38:25.380
Where's the soda?

38:25.410 --> 38:27.000
Hey,it's a two-Way street, Richard.

38:27.040 --> 38:29.740
You answer the
questions, we’ll get you a soda.

38:29.980 --> 38:33.150
Yeah. Uh... I found it.

38:33.180 --> 38:34.560
That's it. I found it.

38:34.590 --> 38:36.600
No, you didn't.

38:36.630 --> 38:38.620
I didn't?

38:38.730 --> 38:40.390
Damn.

38:40.490 --> 38:43.340
Okay. Uh,yeah,I stole it.

38:43.370 --> 38:46.050
That's right. I stole it.

38:48.220 --> 38:51.910
Give me my purse! Give me my purse!

38:56.660 --> 38:57.770
Help!

38:57.800 --> 38:59.250
Somebody!

38:59.500 --> 39:00.900
I needed money.

39:00.960 --> 39:02.290
Then what happened?

39:02.330 --> 39:03.470
I got high.

39:03.510 --> 39:05.610
- Then what?
- I got high again.

39:05.630 --> 39:08.240
Then what? Did you kill her?

39:09.380 --> 39:11.837
We found her purse and the bloody murder

39:11.838 --> 39:14.540
weapon in the place where
you were sleeping.

39:14.800 --> 39:18.970
We found her dead body inside this car.

39:21.580 --> 39:23.330
Why'd you pick that car, Richard?

39:23.370 --> 39:25.450
I don't know what you mean.

39:25.510 --> 39:27.280
We found your fingerprint
inside the car.

39:27.320 --> 39:29.600
No, that wasn't me.

39:29.630 --> 39:32.590
Tha-Tha-That
w... that was them.

39:32.640 --> 39:34.420
Who's them?

39:34.470 --> 39:37.830
I c... I can't talk no more.

39:40.320 --> 39:41.880
- Come on. Tell the truth.
- Get him out of here.

39:41.910 --> 39:43.120
- Not you.
- Tell the truth.

39:43.160 --> 39:44.360
This is all your fault.

39:44.390 --> 39:46.830
We'll take care of you. We'll
get you into rehab. Come on.

39:46.860 --> 39:48.470
- There is no truth!
- Tell the truth!

39:48.510 --> 39:50.860
- There is no truth!
- ****

39:50.890 --> 39:52.130
Hey!

39:52.160 --> 39:54.750
As of right now, you’re
suspended for two weeks.

39:54.780 --> 39:56.318
Grissom,you and I both know that Gedda

39:56.319 --> 39:58.140
killed that girl and
pinned it on that bum.

39:58.180 --> 39:59.342
They gave him drugs, got him

39:59.343 --> 40:00.720
high, and planted the evidence.

40:00.750 --> 40:02.140
You just got to give
me a chance to prove it.

40:02.180 --> 40:03.940
You've had all your chances.

40:03.970 --> 40:07.670
You take the suspension or you're fired.

40:19.920 --> 40:23.910
Hey. I got an update for you.

40:23.940 --> 40:25.630
He got suspended.

40:25.660 --> 40:27.410
Good work.
