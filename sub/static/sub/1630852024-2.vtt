you've never made out

we didn't have
another incident.

to her story about La Llorona.

17:42.626 --> 17:44.498
I know this sounds crazy,

17:44.541 --> 17:46.587

in which she's
telling the truth?

17:47.153 --> 17:48.545
[scoffs]

17:48.589 --> 17:50.286
I've been doing
lots of research,

17:50.330 --> 17:54.203
and ghosts like La Llorona
exist in different cultures.

17:54.247 --> 17:57.772
They're spirits
of unfettered
feral motherhood.

17:57.815 --> 18:00.601
And look, there's different
versions of the legend,

18:00.644 --> 18:05.040
but they're always mothers,
and they always
go after children.

18:05.084 --> 18:10.611
I even read one article
where a La Llorona
can go after an unborn child.

18:10.654 --> 18:13.483
Okay, Toni,
that's enough, okay?

18:13.527 --> 18:16.486
I'm sorry, but your friend
is going to be charged
for murder.

to listen to me.

is happening in Rivervale.

any of our children are safe
until it's over.

but I finally figured out

in the bottle.

doing this all day?

26:56.702 --> 26:58.312
Reggie...

26:58.355 --> 27:00.531
-[Reggie sobs]
-It's just a car.

27:02.185 --> 27:04.535
I just got back
from the hospital

27:04.579 --> 27:07.495
and my dad died 20 minutes ago.

27:07.538 --> 27:09.366
Oh, my God. Reggie.

27:10.106 --> 27:12.239
I'm so, so sorry.

27:12.282 --> 27:14.284
I will always be here for you.

27:14.328 --> 27:15.503
It's just you and me,

27:16.809 --> 27:17.940
as it should be.

27:24.991 --> 27:26.340
Toni, I found something,

27:26.383 --> 27:28.385
a pattern, retracing her steps.

27:28.429 --> 27:30.823
So she's following
a direct line
from Sweetwater River.

27:30.866 --> 27:33.652
First Thornhill, where Cheryl
encountered her,

27:33.695 --> 27:37.917
then Lucinda's,
my house, Rivervale High.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.483
-Now--
-This apartment.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.442
Where she came after
Baby Anthony.

27:41.485 --> 27:44.750
Her target was,
and I bet still is,
Baby Anthony.

27:44.793 --> 27:46.447
Well, how do you know?

27:46.490 --> 27:48.275
Mother's intuition, I guess.

27:51.321 --> 27:55.499
[groans] Fangs,
take Baby Anthony
to the Whyte Wyrm.

27:55.543 --> 27:57.501
And surround him
with the Serpents.

27:57.545 --> 27:59.852
I don't think she'll
go after him
with a crowd around.

27:59.895 --> 28:01.375
-[thunder crashing]
-Okay.

28:01.418 --> 28:02.506
And where are you going?

28:02.550 --> 28:04.726
Cheryl's.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.772
We need to contact
that ghost bitch,

28:06.815 --> 28:09.426
and she's the only person
I know who knows
how to channel the spirits.

28:17.521 --> 28:22.831
So we'll go to the funeral home
tomorrow morning
to finalize arrangements.

28:22.875 --> 28:25.791
But... everything's in order.

28:26.748 --> 28:27.793
Thanks, Ronnie.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.187
I have a surprise for you.

28:33.189 --> 28:37.498
I was going
to wait until things
calmed down a bit,

28:37.541 --> 28:40.675
but I think my Reggie-kins
deserves a pick-me-up.

28:47.987 --> 28:50.729
You'll find that car key

28:50.772 --> 28:55.124
fits into a gorgeous
1969 Camaro SS 4-speed.

28:57.083 --> 29:00.303
I thought you might
want to take it
for a spin later tonight.

29:00.347 --> 29:01.522
This is great.

29:02.392 --> 29:04.003
Thanks, Ronnie.

29:04.046 --> 29:05.395
I really appreciate it.

29:06.396 --> 29:07.484
Reggie...

29:11.358 --> 29:13.099
We're gonna be okay, right?

29:14.404 --> 29:16.450
Of course.

29:16.493 --> 29:18.495
Nothing could
ever come between us.

29:21.411 --> 29:23.544
[thunder crashing]

29:23.587 --> 29:26.852
Hear ye, hear ye,
we sacred women
have gathered here

29:26.895 --> 29:30.812
to summon the entity
known as La Llorona,

29:30.856 --> 29:33.684
or the weeping woman.

29:33.728 --> 29:36.818
Spirit, your sisters
call out to you.

29:36.862 --> 29:40.909
You who visited this house
and the house
of Elizabeth Cooper

29:40.953 --> 29:43.129
and the house
of Antoinette Topaz.

29:43.172 --> 29:45.522
Spirit, speak to us.

29:46.741 --> 29:48.047
What is thy name?

29:49.396 --> 29:51.528
Spirit, reveal thyself.

29:51.572 --> 29:54.140
[all] Spirit, reveal thy self.

29:54.183 --> 29:56.359
Spirit, reveal thy self.

29:56.403 --> 29:59.145
Spirit, reveal thy self.

29:59.188 --> 30:01.234
-Spirit, reveal thy self.
-[wind gusts]

30:01.277 --> 30:03.192
[objects clattering]

30:03.236 --> 30:04.803
[thunder rumbling]

30:09.633 --> 30:10.896
[eerie wailing]

30:10.939 --> 30:12.288
-[thunder crashes]
-[screams]

30:13.202 --> 30:14.813
[old woman whimpering]

30:14.856 --> 30:18.773
Is that the spirit?
Who are you? Name thy self?

30:20.688 --> 30:22.995
My name was Martha Mallon.

30:23.038 --> 30:26.607
My employ was as a nurse
in the children's ward

30:26.650 --> 30:29.740
of Rivervale's first hospital.

30:29.784 --> 30:35.529
In those early, hungry years,
we lost many a babe
from the pox,

30:35.572 --> 30:40.839
from the bitter cold,
from a doctor's careless hands.

30:40.882 --> 30:45.321
The townsfolk blamed me
for the loss of their children,

30:45.365 --> 30:47.976
accused me of being
a witch woman.

30:48.020 --> 30:51.458
And they dragged me
and my own children

30:51.501 --> 30:57.116
to the Sweetwater River,
weighed us down with rocks,

30:57.159 --> 30:59.509
and threw us
in the dark waters.

31:00.902 --> 31:01.860
We drowned,

31:03.949 --> 31:07.822
and I became
this cursed thing that I am.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.911
Who summoned you here, spirit?

31:09.955 --> 31:12.348
Who called you
to this earthly plane?

31:12.392 --> 31:14.002
-[coughing]
-[thunder crashes]

31:14.046 --> 31:16.048
[gagging]

31:16.091 --> 31:18.224
-What's happening?
-Do not break the circle
or we'll lose contact.

31:18.267 --> 31:20.269
Speak, Martha,
who summoned you here?

31:20.313 --> 31:22.706
We have to stop, Cheryl,
she's gonna drown.

31:22.750 --> 31:25.579
-[gagging, sputtering]
-Not yet, we need a name.

31:25.622 --> 31:27.624
Speak, Martha,
who summoned you here?

31:27.668 --> 31:29.322
Who called you to this plane?

31:29.365 --> 31:32.107
It was Darla Dickenson,

31:32.151 --> 31:36.372
who did so
from her son's grave.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.157
[coughing]

31:38.200 --> 31:39.941
Nana, I'm sorry,
are you all right?
Are you all right?

31:39.985 --> 31:41.725
-[coughing]
-Forgive me.

31:41.769 --> 31:44.076
Darla Dickenson,
why does that name
sound so familiar?

31:44.119 --> 31:46.469
She's the woman
whose son I killed.

31:48.994 --> 31:50.865
That's why she's doing this.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.438
Tabitha?

32:07.055 --> 32:09.231
"She doesn't understand me.

32:09.275 --> 32:12.495
How could she?
She doesn't have
an artist's soul."

32:12.539 --> 32:14.454
Mmm. [chuckles softly]

32:16.717 --> 32:18.197
You broke into my desk?

32:18.240 --> 32:19.938
It's a huge breach
of privacy and my process.

32:19.981 --> 32:22.331
Oh, right, right, your process.

32:22.375 --> 32:23.985
Your process.

32:24.029 --> 32:26.118
You mean how you sit around
all day playing with your

32:26.161 --> 32:28.729
toy boats while
I work my ass off

32:28.772 --> 32:31.384
so that you can write
a story about a wife

32:31.427 --> 32:34.953
who doesn't understand
her husband and then
kills her husband

32:34.996 --> 32:37.868
because he leaves the cap
off the freakin' toothpaste?

32:37.912 --> 32:39.740
-Hey-- Hey, hey, hey.
-Are you for real?

32:39.783 --> 32:43.091
-Are you kidding me?
-This story is not about us.

32:43.135 --> 32:45.137
It's about the people
who lived here before us,

32:45.180 --> 32:46.312
Sam and Diane.

32:46.355 --> 32:47.617
Oh, Sam and Diane.

32:47.661 --> 32:49.315
-Also--
-Yeah, give me a break.

32:49.358 --> 32:52.187
Also, she doesn't kill him
because of the toothpaste.

32:52.231 --> 32:54.537
She kills him because
he's too obsessed
with his work.

32:54.581 --> 32:57.366
Ah, I'll tell you
why she kills him.

32:57.410 --> 33:00.413
She kills him
because she gets sick
of supporting him

33:00.456 --> 33:03.938
while he displays
a complete disregard
for her feelings.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.549
Maybe that's why
she brains him with a hammer.

33:07.376 --> 33:09.161
Oh!

33:09.204 --> 33:11.946
What's with the Scotch that
you're allegedly not drinking?

33:11.990 --> 33:14.035
I'm not!
Those are for the ships.

33:14.079 --> 33:15.210
And I'm going to pour them out.

33:16.429 --> 33:18.213
Oh.

33:18.257 --> 33:20.955
Let me get this straight.
[chuckles dryly]

33:20.999 --> 33:24.741
You bought a bunch of Scotch
with money that I earned

33:24.785 --> 33:27.657
so you could just
pour it down the drain
for your stupid boats.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.790
Well, you know what?
Screw your ship.

33:29.833 --> 33:31.357
-Screw your...
-Hey!

33:34.055 --> 33:36.144
-Tab--
-You know what,
screw your writing, too.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.667
-Don't.
-Yes!

33:37.711 --> 33:40.018
Please, don't, don't, don't.
Don't! Don't!

33:40.061 --> 33:41.410
Don't!

33:43.021 --> 33:44.022
How could you?

33:44.065 --> 33:45.371
This was a gift from Betty.

33:53.509 --> 33:54.815
[eerie music playing]

33:54.858 --> 33:55.816
[gasps]

34:03.606 --> 34:04.564
No!

34:06.827 --> 34:08.394
We're not like them.

34:09.438 --> 34:11.788
We're stronger.

34:11.832 --> 34:17.490
We're stronger and we
made a promise that we would
work through our problems.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.622
And I love you...

34:19.666 --> 34:20.928
Jughead, and I'm...

34:22.364 --> 34:23.235
sorry.

34:24.758 --> 34:25.672
I'm sorry.

34:27.282 --> 34:28.849
-Did you say, "I love you"?
-[sniffles]

34:29.719 --> 34:30.677
Yeah.

34:33.158 --> 34:35.508
I've been wanting to
say that for a while.

34:35.551 --> 34:37.597
Yeah. I've been
wanting to say it, too.

34:40.643 --> 34:42.167
I love you.

34:42.210 --> 34:43.081
[exhales sharply]

34:52.090 --> 34:53.656
[breath shuddering]

34:55.441 --> 34:56.355
Was that...

34:59.184 --> 35:02.317
What, the ghost leaving?
Are ghosts real now?

35:04.885 --> 35:06.495
I think maybe they are.

35:08.062 --> 35:09.803
And I think maybe...

35:10.804 --> 35:12.458
we scared them away.

35:15.243 --> 35:16.157
[Darla] Finally...

35:17.724 --> 35:18.855
I've been expecting you.

35:23.773 --> 35:24.948
Darla, I'm sorry.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.736
Sorry that Danny
was taken away from you.

35:29.779 --> 35:32.826
And I'm sorry that I was
responsible for his death.

35:32.869 --> 35:35.394
Do you know how many
sons I've buried, Toni?

35:38.179 --> 35:39.702
Danny was my last one.

35:41.835 --> 35:44.490
-My little boy.
-Darla.

35:44.533 --> 35:47.188
We know you
summoned La Llorona.

35:47.232 --> 35:49.712
Now you need to call her off.

35:49.756 --> 35:51.279
[chuckles]

35:52.846 --> 35:55.588
You can't call off La Llorona.

35:56.806 --> 35:57.851
Once summoned,

35:58.808 --> 36:00.636
once a child is promised,

36:02.421 --> 36:03.944
there's no stopping her.

36:05.250 --> 36:06.773
At least,

36:06.816 --> 36:08.775
not until Anthony's dead,

36:09.950 --> 36:12.082
in her arms.

36:12.126 --> 36:14.215
So that's what you want?

36:14.259 --> 36:16.043
An eye for an eye?

36:16.086 --> 36:18.088
My baby's life for your son?

36:19.916 --> 36:22.354
-Yes-
-Well, it's not gonna happen,

36:22.397 --> 36:25.748
because there's
a crew of Serpents surrounding
Baby Anthony, guarding him.

36:27.620 --> 36:28.490
Toni...

36:30.188 --> 36:32.886
you're a mother.

36:32.929 --> 36:36.716
Even if there were
50 men standing
between you and your baby,

36:38.021 --> 36:39.675
would that stop you?

36:39.719 --> 36:42.548
-No.
-[Darla] Exactly.

36:42.591 --> 36:48.945
Now imagine that
primal maternal force
times a hundred.

36:48.989 --> 36:54.081
La Llorona is a storm
unlike any you've ever seen.

36:57.693 --> 36:58.520
[door opens]

37:01.306 --> 37:02.655
Oh, my God.

37:02.698 --> 37:03.612
[Toni] Fangs?

37:04.309 --> 37:06.093
Anthony?

37:06.136 --> 37:07.268
[Fangs grunts weakly]

37:07.312 --> 37:09.183
Fangs!

37:09.227 --> 37:10.097
-[Fangs coughs]
-Hey!

37:11.664 --> 37:12.578
Where's Anthony?

37:13.796 --> 37:15.145
-Where's our son?
-[coughs]

37:16.059 --> 37:17.147
She...

37:17.191 --> 37:18.453
She took him.

37:18.497 --> 37:20.281
Where? Where did she take him?

37:20.325 --> 37:21.239
Sweetwater.

37:23.328 --> 37:25.504
-Go!
-We need to beat them
to the river.

37:27.419 --> 37:28.768
[coughs]

37:31.945 --> 37:33.555
[hammering]

37:35.775 --> 37:36.819
Hey, you're kind of quiet.

37:38.691 --> 37:39.605
Understandably.

37:40.649 --> 37:43.478
I guess I'm just... wondering.

37:45.088 --> 37:46.220
What?

37:47.308 --> 37:49.223
Our fighting, was that...

37:49.267 --> 37:52.966
the ghosts... or... us?

37:55.055 --> 37:56.709
I don't know. Maybe both.

37:59.364 --> 38:01.235
Look, that was
our first real fight.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.193
[Tabitha sighs]

38:03.237 --> 38:04.804
-We survived.
-[chuckles]

38:04.847 --> 38:06.762
We lived to tell the tale.

38:06.806 --> 38:08.416
I mean, barely.

38:08.460 --> 38:11.245
What's our next test gonna be?

38:11.289 --> 38:14.117
Maybe love is just
a series of tests,

38:14.161 --> 38:16.250
test the strength
of our relationship.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.947
[both chuckle softly]

38:17.991 --> 38:20.298
I know that's
kind of bleak, but...

38:20.341 --> 38:21.951
-it's also kind of--
-Kind of sweet.

38:23.083 --> 38:23.910
[Tabitha chuckles]

39:01.251 --> 39:03.166
-[thunder crashing]
-[high-pitched wailing]

39:04.646 --> 39:05.647
[Toni] Stop!

39:06.605 --> 39:07.736
You're not taking my baby.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.434
He's innocent.

39:09.477 --> 39:11.740
[Martha] No one is innocent.

39:11.784 --> 39:15.265
You were, your children were.

39:15.309 --> 39:16.832
[neck cracks]

39:16.876 --> 39:21.271
I'm sorry for everything
you went through,

39:21.315 --> 39:25.058
but you could show us mercy.

39:25.101 --> 39:26.494
You could spare my son.

39:26.538 --> 39:28.453
[Martha] I was called forth.

39:28.496 --> 39:31.064
I can't return
without the babe.

39:31.107 --> 39:33.371
Well, what if I could
take away the suffering?

39:34.023 --> 39:35.068
For good.

39:36.025 --> 39:37.375
You could give it to me.

39:39.551 --> 39:41.030
And that way, you'd be free.

39:41.074 --> 39:42.292
[Martha] Why would
you offer that?

39:43.990 --> 39:46.384
Because I would give up
anything for my son,

39:48.124 --> 39:49.952
my life.

39:49.996 --> 39:52.825
But also because I killed
another woman's child,

39:54.957 --> 39:56.524
and I should be
punished for that.

39:57.699 --> 39:58.700
And it should be me.

40:00.006 --> 40:01.921
Not Baby Anthony.

40:01.964 --> 40:04.140
You've suffered enough, Martha.

40:05.490 --> 40:06.665
Let me take your place.

40:26.467 --> 40:28.295
Promise me you'll
take care of him, Betty.

40:33.779 --> 40:35.433
[high-pitched wails continue]

40:40.786 --> 40:42.396
[thunder crashes]

40:42.440 --> 40:43.484
[high-pitched wail]

40:43.528 --> 40:45.747
[whooshing]

40:52.928 --> 40:54.321
[high-pitched wails continue]

40:57.150 --> 40:58.456
Protect him, Betty.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.677
And please let him know
his mother loved him.

41:25.091 --> 41:26.440
[Anthony cooing]

41:28.964 --> 41:29.791
[Jughead] Hmm.

41:31.184 --> 41:33.273
Let me ask you
something, friends.

41:33.316 --> 41:36.842
Is there a better word
for motherhood
than "sacrifice"?

41:36.885 --> 41:39.366
The next time a weeping woman
rises from Sweetwater River

41:39.409 --> 41:41.803
or, if you prefer,
the river Styx,

41:41.847 --> 41:44.371
a different soul
will take her path,

41:44.414 --> 41:48.636
a path that both begins
and ends in Rivervale.

41:50.420 --> 41:53.685
[high-pitched,
screeching whine]

41:53.728 --> 41:54.555
[thud]
