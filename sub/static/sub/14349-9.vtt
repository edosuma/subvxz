00:08.064 --> 00:11.431
Earth-style
distress signal--SOS.

00:11.501 --> 00:14.129
I've answered it on all frequencies,
sir. They don't reply.

00:14.204 --> 00:16.297
Not a vessel, a ground source.

00:16.373 --> 00:19.831
The third planet in this solar system,
according to my instruments.

00:22.379 --> 00:25.314
Directly ahead.
Definitely an Earth-style signal.

00:25.382 --> 00:28.818
We're hundreds of light years
from Earth, Mr. Spock.

00:28.885 --> 00:31.854
No colonies or vessels
out this far.

00:38.461 --> 00:41.862
Measuring the planet now, Captain.
It's spheroid-shaped.

00:41.932 --> 00:46.596
Circumference--
24,874 miles.

00:46.670 --> 00:50.936
Mass--6 times 1 0
to the 2 1 st power tons.

00:51.007 --> 00:54.465
Mean density--5.51 7.

00:54.544 --> 00:56.478
Atmosphere...

00:56.546 --> 00:59.014
oxygen, nitrogen.

00:59.082 --> 01:01.414
Earth!

01:02.452 --> 01:05.444
Not the Earth,
another Earth.

01:05.522 --> 01:07.513
Another Earth?

01:19.236 --> 01:21.727
Space--
the final frontier.

01:23.240 --> 01:26.676
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

01:26.743 --> 01:31.976
Its five-year mission--
to explore strange new worlds...

01:32.048 --> 01:34.812
to seek out new life
and new civilizations...

01:36.086 --> 01:39.351
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.

02:10.720 --> 02:14.178
Captain's Log,
stardate 2713.5.

02:14.257 --> 02:17.988
In the distant reaches of our galaxy,
we have made an astonishing discover--

02:18.061 --> 02:20.791
Earth-type radio signals
coming from a planet

02:20.864 --> 02:24.163
which apparently is an exact duplicate
of the Earth.

02:24.234 --> 02:27.294
It seems impossible,
but there it is.

02:27.370 --> 02:30.305
- Hold us in a fixed orbit, Mr. Spock.
- Affirmative, Captain.

02:30.373 --> 02:33.570
- Still no response, communications?
- None, Captain.

02:33.643 --> 02:36.305
We'll beam down.
Alert security.

02:36.379 --> 02:39.678
Prepare to transport
landing party to surface.

02:39.749 --> 02:41.683
We'll land in the vicinity

02:41.751 --> 02:44.185
of the distress signals
now being received.

03:15.318 --> 03:17.252
Identical.

03:17.320 --> 03:21.086
Earth...as it was
in the early 1 900s.

03:21.157 --> 03:23.091
More the, uh, mid-1 900s.

03:23.159 --> 03:26.651
I would say, Captain,
approximately 1 960.

03:26.730 --> 03:28.664
But where is everybody?

03:28.732 --> 03:31.758
Readings indicate that natural
deterioration has been taking place

03:31.835 --> 03:34.099
on this planet
for at least several centuries.

03:34.170 --> 03:37.606
- You mean there's no one alive?
- Not conclusive, yeoman.

03:37.674 --> 03:41.610
The evidence would suggest
that the distress signal is automated.

03:45.715 --> 03:47.774
Now, this is marvelous--

03:47.851 --> 03:51.947
the most horrible conglomeration
of antique architecture I've ever seen.

04:05.869 --> 04:07.996
Mr. Spock.

04:11.541 --> 04:13.475
[Tricycle Bell Rings]

04:30.260 --> 04:32.125
[Wheel Squeaks]

04:32.195 --> 04:35.289
Mine! Mine!

04:36.633 --> 04:39.261
Mine!

04:39.335 --> 04:42.736
Mine! Mine!

04:45.208 --> 04:48.644
Mine! Mine! Mine!

05:08.998 --> 05:13.025
[Sobbing]
It's broke.

05:13.102 --> 05:16.094
Somebody...broke it.

05:18.608 --> 05:21.202
Fix.

05:21.277 --> 05:25.043
Somebody...please fix.
[Sobbing]

05:25.114 --> 05:27.446
Of course
somebody will fix it.

05:27.517 --> 05:30.645
Definitely humanoid,
in spite of the distortion.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.154
But with the mind
of a child.

05:35.191 --> 05:38.854
[Gasping]

05:38.928 --> 05:42.455
- Bones, what is it?
- A seizure of some type.

05:49.305 --> 05:52.103
- We want to help you.
- Liar!

05:53.243 --> 05:55.973
Never...never!

05:56.045 --> 05:58.172
Never! Never!

05:58.248 --> 06:02.014
Never! Never! Never!

06:15.665 --> 06:17.599
It's dead.

06:18.668 --> 06:21.159
- It's incredible.
- What?

06:21.237 --> 06:23.831
Its metabolic rate--

06:23.907 --> 06:26.637
it's impossibly high
as if it's burning itself up,

06:26.709 --> 06:31.840
almost as if it aged a century
in just the past few minutes.

06:31.915 --> 06:33.849
[Footsteps]

06:36.019 --> 06:37.953
Come on!

06:54.003 --> 06:55.937
[Creaking]

07:18.728 --> 07:20.662
How old is this thing?

07:20.730 --> 07:22.857
About 300 years.

07:22.932 --> 07:24.866
[Thumping]

07:30.673 --> 07:34.507
- [Groan]
- Come out!

07:34.577 --> 07:36.841
We mean you no harm.

07:45.355 --> 07:49.553
- Don't hurt me, please.
- I'm not going to hurt you.

07:49.626 --> 07:53.289
- Please, don't. I didn't do anything.
- I won't hurt you.

07:53.363 --> 07:56.093
- No, please, don't.
- I only want to talk to you.

07:56.165 --> 07:58.190
- No, don't. Don't hurt.
- Come on.

07:58.267 --> 08:01.202
- Don't, please.
- I won't hurt you.

08:01.270 --> 08:03.636
It's all right.
Come on.

08:03.706 --> 08:06.334
We won't hurt you, sweetheart.
We're your friends.

08:06.409 --> 08:09.139
No, shh!

08:09.212 --> 08:11.544
Take the guards.
Have a look outside.

08:11.614 --> 08:14.378
Radioactive readings, chemical
pollution, any further sign of life.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.384
Right, Captain.

08:20.390 --> 08:24.486
I wonder what happened to her
that she should be so terrified of us.

08:35.571 --> 08:37.505
[Tricorder Whines]

09:01.998 --> 09:05.092
But I remember the things
you Grups did--

09:05.168 --> 09:08.797
burning, yelling,
hurting people.

09:08.871 --> 09:12.068
We didn't do anything
like that.

09:12.141 --> 09:14.075
You're not going to hurt?

09:14.143 --> 09:16.441
Well, of course not.

09:16.512 --> 09:19.140
We're here to help.

09:19.215 --> 09:21.274
Grups don't help.

09:21.350 --> 09:24.183
But we will.

09:24.253 --> 09:27.450
What happened here?
Where is everybody?

09:29.225 --> 09:31.523
You know.

09:31.594 --> 09:35.724
No, I don't.
Won't you tell me?

09:35.798 --> 09:37.732
You got a foolie,
is that it?

09:37.800 --> 09:40.234
You want me to play,
but I can't.

09:40.303 --> 09:44.262
- I don't know the rules.
- Foolie?

09:44.340 --> 09:46.274
A game, you know.

09:46.342 --> 09:49.175
I can't play a game
without rules.

09:49.245 --> 09:51.679
Even Grups ought to know that.

09:51.748 --> 09:54.683
- What are Grups?
- You are.

09:56.352 --> 09:59.788
They will,
when Onlies get old.

09:59.856 --> 10:01.790
Grownups.

10:05.962 --> 10:10.092
You said something about the...Grups
doing bad things--

10:10.166 --> 10:12.828
yelling, hurting, burning.

10:12.902 --> 10:16.338
That was when they started
to get sick in the before time.

10:16.405 --> 10:19.499
We hid,
then they were gone.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.873
Am I doing all right?

10:21.944 --> 10:24.378
You're doing fine.

10:24.447 --> 10:26.881
You said the Grups got sick.

10:26.949 --> 10:30.385
Is that why there aren't
any of them around?

10:30.453 --> 10:32.921
Yes. They died,

10:32.989 --> 10:34.923
but that was after
the awful things.

10:37.026 --> 10:40.484
A plague, Captain.
That could explain a lot of it.

10:42.532 --> 10:45.763
But what about the children,
the...Onlies?

10:45.835 --> 10:48.269
Didn't the awful things
affect them?

10:48.337 --> 10:51.272
Of course not.
We're here, aren't we?

10:51.340 --> 10:53.274
More of you?
How many?

10:53.342 --> 10:55.276
All there are.

11:12.962 --> 11:16.989
- What's your name?
- Miri.

11:17.066 --> 11:19.830
Miri...

11:19.902 --> 11:21.836
pretty name...

11:23.172 --> 11:25.163
for a pretty young woman.

11:28.778 --> 11:30.712
Pretty?

11:32.849 --> 11:34.783
Very pretty.

12:07.850 --> 12:09.784

' Nyah yah yah-yah yah

13:17.853 --> 13:19.787
Children, Captain,
lots of them.

13:19.855 --> 13:22.255
We couldn't begin
to get close to them.

13:22.325 --> 13:26.284
They just seemed
to scurry away like animals.

13:26.362 --> 13:29.798
- Only children.
- Miri said all the adults died.

13:29.865 --> 13:33.301
That creature which attacked us
was certainly no child.

13:33.369 --> 13:38.272
Perhaps it died of the disease
the girl's talking about.

13:38.341 --> 13:40.935
There must be
records somewhere...

13:41.010 --> 13:43.774
and answers to some
of our questions.

13:45.114 --> 13:47.139
Miri...

13:47.216 --> 13:49.207
do you know any buildings

13:49.285 --> 13:51.412
where the doctors
used to work?

13:51.487 --> 13:54.945
Yes, I know that.
Them and their pills and things.

13:55.024 --> 13:57.515
- Take me there?
- That's a bad place.

13:57.593 --> 14:00.323
It's important.

14:00.396 --> 14:02.091
Please?

14:02.164 --> 14:04.098
All right.

14:08.104 --> 14:10.538
Do you have a name, too?

14:10.606 --> 14:12.699
Yes. It'sJim.

14:12.775 --> 14:14.743
I like that name.

14:14.810 --> 14:17.438
Good. I like yours, too.

14:17.513 --> 14:20.004
I like you.

14:21.484 --> 14:23.418
Do you, really?

14:23.486 --> 14:26.580
I wouldn't lie to you.

14:26.655 --> 14:29.681
I wouldn't lie to you,
either,Jim.

14:31.794 --> 14:34.729
I remember the Grups,
but you're nice.

14:34.797 --> 14:36.765
You're different.

14:38.300 --> 14:40.234
Why, thankyou.

14:46.075 --> 14:49.135
It's already starting.
I knew it would.

14:49.211 --> 14:52.078
Just like it did
with the Grups.

14:52.148 --> 14:54.412
It'll spread all overyou,
and you'll yell.

14:54.483 --> 14:56.883
You'll try to hurt everybody.
Then you'll die.

14:56.952 --> 14:59.716
I knew it would!
I knew it would!

15:11.967 --> 15:15.403
Captain's Log,
stardate 2713.6.

15:15.471 --> 15:17.905
The building Miriledus to

15:17.973 --> 15:21.909
also housed an automatic
transmission station,

15:21.977 --> 15:24.810
which sent out the signals
that drewus to this planet.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.814
We also discovered
something else--

15:26.882 --> 15:30.318
that the blues plotches,
characteristic of the unknown disease

15:30.386 --> 15:32.684
had appearedon each of us,

15:32.755 --> 15:36.054
with the exception
of Mr. Spock.

15:36.125 --> 15:38.059
There wasa well-equipped laborator
in the building.

15:38.127 --> 15:40.618
Dr. McCoy took tissue samples
of each of us

15:40.696 --> 15:43.358
in an attempt to isolate
the organism responsible.

15:43.432 --> 15:46.230
A veritable zoo of bacteria.

15:49.138 --> 15:52.869
Beam down a biocomputer
and a portable electronic microscope.

15:52.942 --> 15:56.776
If I'm dealing with viruses, I'll need
better equipment than I have here.

15:56.846 --> 16:00.304
- Yes, Doctor. Captain Kirk?
- Yes, Lieutenant?

16:00.382 --> 16:02.680
I've got volunteers
ready to help you, sir.

16:02.751 --> 16:05.686
Under no circumstances
is anyone to beam down.

16:05.754 --> 16:08.689
We can't take any chances
with further contamination.

16:08.757 --> 16:12.193
- But, Captain, if you become too ill--
- My orders stand, Lieutenant.

16:12.261 --> 16:16.197
You can help us best
by standing by. Kirk out.

16:19.668 --> 16:22.831
- Bones.
- Hmm?

16:22.905 --> 16:27.933
Why do you think the symptoms
haven't appeared in Mr. Spock?

16:28.010 --> 16:32.538
I don't know. Probably
the little bugs have no appetite

16:32.615 --> 16:34.708
for green blood.

16:34.783 --> 16:37.513
Being a red-blooded human

16:37.586 --> 16:40.612
obviously has its disadvantages.

16:42.057 --> 16:44.992
There you have
a museum piece, Doctor.

16:45.060 --> 16:47.494
Lens type--
manually operated, light-activated.

16:47.563 --> 16:50.498
Spare me the analysis,
Mr. Spock, please.

16:50.566 --> 16:53.091
It is enough that it works.

16:59.775 --> 17:02.107
It spreads real fast.
I know.

17:02.178 --> 17:05.204
When you're old,
it covers you like anything.

17:16.025 --> 17:18.323

That's what it was.

Life prolongation.

17:40.616 --> 17:43.050
Didn't have much luck,
did they?

17:47.623 --> 17:50.057
Captain's Log.
Dr. McCoy's biocomputer

17:50.125 --> 17:52.059
and a portable
electronic microscope

17:52.127 --> 17:54.687
have been beamed down
from the Enterprise.

17:54.763 --> 17:58.255
They will be used in conjunction
with computer banks on-boardship.

17:58.334 --> 18:00.268
Tubular with
extreme multiplicability.

18:00.336 --> 18:04.568
Appear to have affinity
for nucleic acids...

18:07.543 --> 18:09.977
This was 300 years ago, Captain.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.979
All the adults are dead.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.880
Only the children
are left alive.

18:14.950 --> 18:17.885
But children become adults.

18:17.953 --> 18:20.888
At least...
they have up to now.

18:30.499 --> 18:32.990
Doctor?

18:33.068 --> 18:35.696
There are certain
glandular changes

18:35.771 --> 18:39.707
which take place upon entering puberty,
are there not?

18:39.775 --> 18:44.712
Of course. It changes the entire
body system. You know that.

18:44.780 --> 18:47.613
Of course you know that.
Why?

18:47.683 --> 18:52.586
Is it not possible
that these children here,

18:52.655 --> 18:55.590
as they enter puberty,
contract the disease?

18:55.658 --> 18:58.957
That would explain
why there are no adults.

19:01.230 --> 19:05.599
Glandular, postpubescent.
It could be.

19:07.503 --> 19:10.870
It's illogical.
It does not follow.

19:10.939 --> 19:13.874
All the adults
on this planet died

19:13.942 --> 19:16.775
300 years ago,

19:16.845 --> 19:19.780
but there are children
in the streets.

19:19.848 --> 19:22.316
Who die when they
enter adolescence.

19:23.986 --> 19:26.955
But...how do they
keep the line going?

19:28.991 --> 19:32.119
One thing, Captain.
If she were a wild animal

19:32.194 --> 19:34.719
ever since she's
been a little girl,

19:34.797 --> 19:37.265
how do you explain
that she wants to stay with us?

19:37.333 --> 19:39.267
Lone liness. Curiosity.

19:39.335 --> 19:42.133
I think children have
an instinctive need for adults.

19:42.204 --> 19:46.231
They want to be told
right and wrong.

19:46.308 --> 19:50.244
There may be other emotions
at work in this case, Captain.

19:50.312 --> 19:52.507
[McCoy]
She likes you,Jim.

19:52.581 --> 19:55.573
She's becoming a woman.

20:07.963 --> 20:11.763
- Mr. Spock.
- [Communicator Beeps]

20:11.834 --> 20:15.827
- Spock here.
- Here are those figures you askedfor.

20:15.904 --> 20:17.963
12 to the 10th power.

20:20.075 --> 20:23.067
Metabolic rate--72%.

20:25.714 --> 20:29.582
Production of nucleic acids
reduced to 33% of normal.

20:33.288 --> 20:38.089
Conventional chronological
progression--100x3.6.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.287
Acknowledged, Lieutenant.

20:45.701 --> 20:47.828
I have the calculations now.

20:49.438 --> 20:53.636
Try again.
See if you can find anything outside.

20:53.709 --> 20:57.076
Hey...clean up that desk
for me, will you?

20:57.146 --> 20:59.273
All right,Jim.

21:03.185 --> 21:05.676
According to
their life prolongation plan,

21:05.754 --> 21:07.688
what they thought
they were accomplishing,

21:07.756 --> 21:09.690
a person would age
only one month

21:09.758 --> 21:12.318
for every 1 00 years
of real time.

21:14.129 --> 21:17.428
1 00 years?
And only one month?

21:17.499 --> 21:20.263
Exactly, yeoman.

21:20.335 --> 21:22.826
Evidently through
some miscalculation,

21:22.905 --> 21:25.840
this virus annihilated
the entire adult population

21:25.908 --> 21:27.842
in a very short period,

21:27.910 --> 21:29.844
Ieaving only the children.

21:29.912 --> 21:31.846
But that means
these children...

21:31.914 --> 21:35.077
could very well be
immensely old.

21:35.150 --> 21:38.381
That would certainly answer the question
of what happened to their parents.

21:38.454 --> 21:42.322
- Answers it very well.
- Children who never age...

21:42.391 --> 21:46.691
eternal childhood, filled with play,
no responsibilities.

21:46.762 --> 21:48.696
It's almost like a dream.

21:48.764 --> 21:51.198
I wouldn't examine that dream
too closely, yeoman.

21:51.266 --> 21:53.928
It might not turn out
to be very pretty.

21:54.002 --> 21:56.937
A few days ago
or a week ago

21:57.005 --> 21:59.496
that creature that attacked us

21:59.575 --> 22:02.339
could have been
just like Miri.

22:02.411 --> 22:07.644
A child entering puberty on this planet
means a death sentence.

22:09.751 --> 22:11.685
Do you suppose she knows?

22:14.656 --> 22:17.989
- I don't think so.
- If they're as old as Spock claims,

22:18.060 --> 22:20.858
they must have some idea
of what's happening.

22:20.929 --> 22:25.366
There's no adult interpretation.
I think we're dealing with children,

22:25.434 --> 22:27.868
immensely old perhaps
but nonetheless children.

22:27.936 --> 22:30.905
We've got to do something
about the others.

22:30.973 --> 22:33.339
We can't even get
a glimpse of them.

22:33.408 --> 22:36.138
You couldn't get close
to the other kids?

22:36.211 --> 22:40.272
Impossible. They know
the area too well, like mice.

22:40.349 --> 22:42.544
I'm going to try.

22:46.154 --> 22:48.088
Miri?

22:50.526 --> 22:52.460
Come here.

22:58.267 --> 23:00.895
- You want to go someplace with me?
- Sure.

23:14.683 --> 23:16.674
That little girl--

23:16.752 --> 23:20.688
Is at least 300 years older
than you are, yeoman.

23:20.756 --> 23:22.690
Think about it.

23:48.750 --> 23:51.947
Miri is with them!
Why?

23:52.020 --> 23:54.352
- Why?
- What's she going to do,Jahn?

23:54.423 --> 23:57.551
I don't--I don't know.

23:57.626 --> 23:59.890
I know what
we've got to do.

23:59.962 --> 24:01.953
There are more of them
than we see.

24:02.030 --> 24:06.364
Somewhere, up in the sky,

24:06.435 --> 24:08.995
maybe, somewhere.

24:09.071 --> 24:12.006
They talk to each other
all the time.

24:12.074 --> 24:16.511
You know Grups. You know what they do--
the hurting, the killing.

24:16.578 --> 24:18.512
I remember the way it was.

24:18.580 --> 24:22.516
That's right,
the way it was in the before time.

24:26.521 --> 24:30.457
They talk to the other Grups
with these little boxes.

24:33.729 --> 24:37.665
Now, if they didn't have
those little boxes,

24:37.733 --> 24:41.794
they'd be...all alone.

24:41.870 --> 24:45.897
- Huh?
- But they don't see us. We hide.

24:45.974 --> 24:48.875
- Olly olly oxen free!
- Olly olly oxen free!

24:48.944 --> 24:52.209
- Olly olly oxen free!
- Olly olly oxen free!

24:52.280 --> 24:54.714
No!

24:54.783 --> 24:58.048
It's not a game.

24:58.120 --> 24:59.781
It's real.

25:01.423 --> 25:04.290
They're dangerous. They're Grups.
Don't you understand?

25:04.359 --> 25:06.350
Jahn!

25:19.941 --> 25:22.273
All right! Let's hide!

25:46.034 --> 25:47.968
[Thump]

25:50.639 --> 25:52.607
[Children Scream]

25:54.543 --> 25:56.773
Aah!

26:07.723 --> 26:09.452
Aah!

26:22.804 --> 26:24.738
Dead.

26:24.806 --> 26:28.742
I don't understand it.
My phaser wasn't set to kill.

26:33.515 --> 26:36.541
Her name was Louise.

26:36.618 --> 26:40.110
She was just a little bit older
than I am when it happened.

26:41.690 --> 26:43.624
Oh,Jim.

26:52.334 --> 26:54.598
Data has been fed
into the computers.

26:54.669 --> 26:57.763
- Standby.
- Acknowledged.

26:57.839 --> 27:01.468
- Are these enough,Jim?
- We could use more, if you don't mind.

27:01.543 --> 27:03.670
No, I don't mind.

27:13.688 --> 27:17.624
There couldn't be any doubt
about what you found here?

27:17.692 --> 27:19.626
This fellow made these notes

27:19.694 --> 27:24.631
in the last weeks
after the disaster began.

27:24.699 --> 27:26.860
I disregard these last entries.

27:26.935 --> 27:30.666
He said himself he was too sick,
too far gone

27:30.739 --> 27:33.970
to be sure he wasn't already mad,
and I agree,

27:34.042 --> 27:37.478
but based on the entries
he made before that,

27:37.546 --> 27:40.014
I know how much time we have.

27:40.081 --> 27:42.572
The ship's computers
will verify my figures.

27:42.651 --> 27:47.588
Only a matter of time before
we all go mad, destroy each other,

27:47.656 --> 27:51.057
till the last of us
finally destroys himself.

28:05.540 --> 28:07.633
What about Miri?

28:07.709 --> 28:10.769
Our guess was correct.
They contract the disease

28:10.846 --> 28:13.576
as they enter puberty
and their metabolism changes.

28:13.648 --> 28:17.675
The notes indicate it doesn't
become acute for a month or so.

28:17.752 --> 28:22.246
I estimate she has perhaps
five or six weeks left.

28:22.324 --> 28:25.122
- What about us?
- The older the victim,

28:25.193 --> 28:28.162
the more rapid the progress
of the disease.

28:31.266 --> 28:35.259
And you? The disease doesn't
seem to be interested in you.

28:35.337 --> 28:39.273
I am a carrier. Whatever happens,
I can't go back to the ship,

28:39.341 --> 28:43.641
and I do want to go
back to the ship, Captain.

28:45.814 --> 28:47.748
Of course, Mr. Spock.

28:50.819 --> 28:53.481
We still don't know
what we're fighting.

28:53.555 --> 28:57.286
But we know what it is
and how fast it works.

28:57.359 --> 29:00.851
It's progressing.
We'll begin to feel it inside soon--

29:00.929 --> 29:04.330
intense fever,
great pain in the extremities,

29:04.399 --> 29:06.162
fuzziness of vision.

29:06.234 --> 29:10.568
Of course, those are the early symptoms.
There'll be more.

29:12.440 --> 29:14.965
You're certain
about the time we have left?

29:15.043 --> 29:17.341
I presume my calculations
are correct.

29:17.412 --> 29:20.575
- Is there any possibility--
- This is the Enterprise.

29:20.649 --> 29:22.446
Spock here.

29:22.517 --> 29:25.953
Computer indicates
170 hours, Mr. Spock.

29:26.021 --> 29:29.320
Verified, Captain.
We have seven days.

29:39.634 --> 29:42.296
Captain's Log,
supplement--

29:42.370 --> 29:46.830
This is the second day of the seven
left to us. We've found nothing.

29:46.908 --> 29:51.140
Enterprise is standing by with labs
and computers ready to assist us.

29:51.212 --> 29:53.510
There's no data,

29:53.581 --> 29:56.141
no stopping point.

29:56.217 --> 29:58.151
I think I've found it.

29:58.219 --> 30:01.154
Janice, take Miri for a walk.

30:01.222 --> 30:03.247
Yes, sir.

30:03.325 --> 30:06.021
Only one half intact.

30:06.094 --> 30:08.824
- Do you know what they were up to?
- More or less.

30:08.897 --> 30:12.333
The idea was to create
a new series of diseases--

30:12.400 --> 30:15.836
a chain reaction of viruses
meant essentially to extend the life

30:15.904 --> 30:17.838
of the human cell immeasurably.

30:17.906 --> 30:21.239
Unfortunately, they weren't successful.
We've seen the results.

30:25.680 --> 30:28.615
You two will have to recreate
their thinking.

30:28.683 --> 30:31.117
If you can isolate
that virus,

30:31.186 --> 30:34.121
we'll be able
to develop a vaccine.

30:36.024 --> 30:40.051
Is that all, Captain?
We have five days, you know.

30:40.128 --> 30:43.359
- I know.
- [Children's Voices]

30:43.431 --> 30:47.128
- ' Nyah yah yah-yah yah '
- The children.

30:47.202 --> 30:49.762
' Nyah yah yah-yah yah '

30:49.838 --> 30:51.772
' Nyah yah yah-yah yah '

30:51.840 --> 30:54.968
' Nyah yah yah-yah yah
Nyah yah yah-yah yah '

31:18.133 --> 31:20.124
- Anything?
- No, nothing.

31:20.201 --> 31:22.226
And you?

31:31.813 --> 31:34.441
[Grate Closes]

31:44.092 --> 31:46.083
Communicators, Captain...

31:49.130 --> 31:51.064
they're gone.

31:51.132 --> 31:53.066
We've got to have
those communicators.

31:53.134 --> 31:55.068
Without them,
we don't have the computers,

31:55.136 --> 31:58.071
and without the computers,
we don't have a chance.

32:03.978 --> 32:07.778
Captain's Log,
stardate 2717.3--

32:07.849 --> 32:10.283
Three days, seven hours
left to us.

32:10.351 --> 32:13.377
Investigation proves
that the supply of food in the area

32:13.455 --> 32:15.389
is running dangerously low.

32:15.457 --> 32:19.325
Unless something is done, the children
will starve in a few months.

32:19.394 --> 32:23.228
The disease is working on each of us
according to Dr. McCoy's prediction.

32:23.298 --> 32:25.732
Our temper sare growing short.

32:25.800 --> 32:28.234
We're no further along
than we were two day sago.

32:28.303 --> 32:32.672
- Haven't you found a thing yet?
- Would you like to take a crack at it?

32:44.219 --> 32:46.346
[Glass Breaks]

32:47.422 --> 32:50.357
No! No!

32:50.425 --> 32:53.053
No!

33:09.144 --> 33:12.045
I'm upset, Captain.
So upset.

33:18.653 --> 33:24.148
Back on the ship, I used to try
to get you to look at my legs.

33:28.463 --> 33:33.833
Captain, look at my legs.

33:58.359 --> 34:01.658
We're all frightened.

34:08.902 --> 34:10.893
[McCoy]
Jim, I found something!

34:17.512 --> 34:20.947
The last slide I examined,
I failed to make the adjustment.

34:21.014 --> 34:24.451
- The slowing down of my responses--
- What did you find?

34:24.518 --> 34:27.886
The disease--
the one they created 300 years ago.

34:27.956 --> 34:29.924
- There's a chance!
- A chance.

34:29.991 --> 34:31.925
At least it's a race now,

34:31.993 --> 34:34.757
and we've just wasted a minute.

34:52.380 --> 34:56.440
That would be some foolie, Miri,
but do you think it would work?

34:56.516 --> 34:58.644
I know.
I know.

34:58.720 --> 35:01.655
Don't you think
I've heard them talk?

35:01.723 --> 35:05.454
They have such little time
to do this dumb thing of theirs--

35:05.526 --> 35:08.791
This baninski thing.
If we get her away--

35:08.863 --> 35:13.095
that yeoman-- that's one person
less to start off with.

35:13.167 --> 35:15.658
But how, Miri,
if they're so busy,

35:15.737 --> 35:17.671
if they're going to have
the big emergency,

35:17.739 --> 35:20.105
how are you going
to get her away?

35:20.174 --> 35:23.769
It's easy. She's always asking me
about the youngest Onlies--

35:23.845 --> 35:26.609
"What if they get sick,
who takes care of them?

35:26.681 --> 35:30.014
"Do they have enough to eat?
Where do they sleep?"

35:30.084 --> 35:34.020
I'll just tell her
one of you fell down and got hurt.

35:34.088 --> 35:36.989
- Me. Say it's me.
- All right. You.

35:37.058 --> 35:39.583
But Grups--
they know things and all that.

35:39.661 --> 35:44.598
You know, I bet they'll
be able to do it with one person less.

35:44.666 --> 35:48.158
Not one-- two.

35:48.236 --> 35:50.466
Because he'll try
to find her.

35:50.538 --> 35:52.472
Who?
Who will, Miri?

35:54.275 --> 35:56.903
The captain.

35:56.978 --> 36:00.072
He'll try to find her,
but he won't...

36:00.148 --> 36:02.013
Mr. Lovey-dovey.

36:02.083 --> 36:03.983
Lovey-dovey--

36:04.052 --> 36:05.986
Bunk bunk on the head.

36:06.054 --> 36:08.420
Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk!

36:08.489 --> 36:11.083
Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk!

36:11.159 --> 36:13.889
Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk!

36:13.961 --> 36:16.657
Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk!

36:16.731 --> 36:19.165
Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk!

36:19.233 --> 36:21.701
Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk!

36:27.241 --> 36:31.678
- It looks right.
- The nitrogen cycle-- it has to be.

36:31.746 --> 36:34.681
Yeah, but the question is--
what's the dosage?

36:34.749 --> 36:38.185
Hmm. That is
a very good question.

36:38.252 --> 36:41.380
Where is she, Miri?
Where's Janice?

36:41.456 --> 36:45.790
What's the matter with you?
How should I know?

36:45.860 --> 36:47.794
Where is she?

36:49.397 --> 36:51.331
Has something happened to her?

36:51.399 --> 36:53.492
Don't you feel all right?

36:53.568 --> 36:56.002
No, I don't feel all right!

36:56.070 --> 36:58.038
None of us feel all right!

36:58.106 --> 37:00.802
Can't you see what's going on?

37:00.875 --> 37:03.776
Jim, I don't want anything
to happen to you.

37:08.583 --> 37:11.518
- I've got to find Janice.
- That's not all, Captain.

37:11.586 --> 37:13.520
We've got to find
those communicators.

37:13.588 --> 37:16.022
We're trying.
We're trying very hard.

37:16.090 --> 37:18.524
That's not enough!
This could be it,

37:18.593 --> 37:22.120
but we can't test it
without the ship's computers.

37:22.196 --> 37:25.859
- We've got to have those communicators.
- This is the vaccine?

37:25.933 --> 37:29.562
That's what the computers
will tell us.

37:31.272 --> 37:35.208
Without them, it could be
a beaker full of death.

37:45.920 --> 37:47.945
Did you hear them?

37:48.022 --> 37:51.116
We only have a few hours left.

37:51.192 --> 37:54.161
I don't care.

37:54.228 --> 37:56.162
You've got to care.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.168
Miri...

38:02.603 --> 38:05.071
I'm going to tell you something.

38:08.810 --> 38:11.938
You, your friends,

38:12.013 --> 38:14.607
all the Onlies
are going to get the disease

38:14.682 --> 38:17.310
unless we succeed
in what we're doing.

38:17.385 --> 38:19.785
- You've seen your friends get it.
- Sometimes.

38:19.854 --> 38:23.654
Not sometimes.
All the times, Miri!

38:23.724 --> 38:27.592
As soon as you start growing up
the way you are--

38:31.432 --> 38:33.696
Don't you know

38:33.768 --> 38:38.364
why you don't like
to play games anymore,

38:38.439 --> 38:42.466
why you don't see your friends
the way you used to?

38:42.543 --> 38:46.001
It's because you're becoming
a young woman...

38:47.849 --> 38:50.784
and the moment you
become a young woman,

38:50.852 --> 38:53.753
you get the disease--
all of you.

38:53.821 --> 38:56.949
That's not true.
Itjust happens sometimes.

38:57.024 --> 39:02.428
All the time, Miri!
It's happening to you right now!

39:02.497 --> 39:05.955
- Look at it! It's in you!
- No!

39:06.033 --> 39:09.230
No! No!

39:15.643 --> 39:18.441
Blah, blah, blah!

39:18.513 --> 39:20.947
No, you got the wrong game--

39:21.015 --> 39:22.949
A teacher, I told you!

39:23.017 --> 39:27.044
Now, what does
a teacher say, huh?

39:27.121 --> 39:29.487
Yeah.

39:29.557 --> 39:31.957
Study, study, study,

39:32.026 --> 39:34.085
or bunk bunk, bad kid.

39:42.403 --> 39:45.338
- It's not funny.
- It's a foolie.

39:45.406 --> 39:47.840
What are you going
to do with me?

39:47.909 --> 39:50.343
You think I'd tell you?

39:51.345 --> 39:53.905
[Door Opens]

39:55.049 --> 39:56.778
Miri.

39:56.851 --> 40:00.685
- You're not supposed to be here.
- I know.

40:00.755 --> 40:03.724
- Something go wrong?
- No.

40:03.791 --> 40:07.124
Okay, then. Don'tjust
stand there in the doorway.

40:07.194 --> 40:09.128
Come on in.

40:15.336 --> 40:18.396
- Listen to him.
- You listen, Miri.

40:18.472 --> 40:22.636
Why do you think I brought him here?
Tell them,Jim.

40:22.710 --> 40:25.270
"Tell them,Jim."
"Tell them,Jim."

40:25.346 --> 40:27.576
Tell them,Jim!
Tell them,Jim!

40:27.648 --> 40:29.912
Tell them,Jim!
Tell them,Jim!

40:29.984 --> 40:32.282
- Tell them,Jim!
- Tell them,Jim!

40:32.353 --> 40:34.583
Tell them,Jim!
Tell them,Jim!

40:34.655 --> 40:37.249
Tell them,Jim!
Tell them,Jim!

40:37.325 --> 40:39.793
Tell them,Jim!
Tell them,Jim!

40:39.860 --> 40:42.124
Tell them,Jim!
Tell them,Jim!

40:42.196 --> 40:45.825
Listen to me.
Listen to me!

40:45.900 --> 40:47.834
No yelling in the classroom!

40:47.902 --> 40:50.336
Look at him--
a very bad citizen.

40:50.404 --> 40:53.202
This isn't a game.
It never was a game.

40:53.274 --> 40:55.538
- Call the police!
- I'm the police.

40:55.610 --> 40:58.670
- Bunk bunk unless you're good.
- You're the teacher.

40:58.746 --> 41:01.044
I got twojobs.
Bunk bunk!

41:01.115 --> 41:04.243
[Children]
Blah blah blah! Blah blah blah!

41:04.318 --> 41:07.685
Blah blah blah!
Blah blah blah!

41:07.755 --> 41:09.723
Listen to me!

41:09.790 --> 41:11.985
You've got our communicators--

41:12.059 --> 41:14.527
the boxes we talk into.

41:14.595 --> 41:18.691
- We need them to talk to the ship.
- Blah blah blah!

41:18.766 --> 41:21.599
No blah blah blah!

41:23.904 --> 41:28.068
Because if we don't
talk to the ship,

41:28.142 --> 41:30.076
if you don't help us...

41:31.412 --> 41:35.212
there won't be
any games anymore.

41:35.282 --> 41:37.443
There won't be anything...

41:38.552 --> 41:40.486
nothing--

41:40.554 --> 41:43.318
no Grups, no Onlies,

41:43.391 --> 41:45.325
nobody left...

41:46.627 --> 41:48.595
forever and ever.

41:53.668 --> 41:55.693
Captain!

42:02.043 --> 42:06.912
Now, listen to me. You've got
to help us before it's too late.

42:06.981 --> 42:08.778
Let Janice go.

42:08.849 --> 42:11.716
Give me those communicators
before it's too late.

42:11.786 --> 42:16.416
' Nyah yah yah-yah yah '

42:16.490 --> 42:19.357
' Nyah yah yah-yah yah '

42:19.427 --> 42:23.625
' Nyah yah yah-yah yah '

42:23.698 --> 42:27.691
' Nyah yah yah-yah yah "

42:27.768 --> 42:30.635
You've seen your friends

42:30.705 --> 42:33.640
change one by one
as they grew up.

42:33.708 --> 42:36.643
Did you ever see
one of them not change?

42:36.711 --> 42:39.145
One by one,
they got the disease,

42:39.213 --> 42:41.238
and they became like--

42:41.315 --> 42:44.307
Iike those creatures you're afraid of--
Iike Louise.

42:44.385 --> 42:46.580
They changed
and got the disease.

42:46.654 --> 42:48.986
The disease I've got,
like Miri has.

42:49.056 --> 42:52.116
Do you understand what I'm saying?
You're not babies.

42:52.193 --> 42:55.253
We can help you!

42:55.329 --> 42:58.560
Bunk bunk!
Bunk bunk!

42:58.632 --> 43:01.123
No, please. No!

43:09.643 --> 43:14.012
It's waiting foryou.
It may only be a matter of months.

43:14.081 --> 43:17.812
Listen to him.
He's telling the truth.

43:17.885 --> 43:20.319
He's funny.
He thinks he's funny.

43:20.387 --> 43:23.083
- Bunk bunk! Get him!
- Look at my arms!

43:23.157 --> 43:26.649
That's what's going
to happen to you...

43:26.727 --> 43:28.661
unless you let me help you.

43:28.729 --> 43:31.755
- Bunk bunk!
- Bunk bunk!

43:31.832 --> 43:33.925
And the little ones...

43:36.170 --> 43:39.037
what's going to happen
to them after you've gone,

43:39.106 --> 43:41.540
after you've turned
into creatures like Louise?

43:41.609 --> 43:45.545
They'll still be here, but not for
long, because the food's all gone.

43:45.613 --> 43:47.547
You've eaten it.

43:47.615 --> 43:49.549
Maybe six months left,
that's all,

43:49.617 --> 43:53.109
and then nothing left to eat,

43:53.187 --> 43:55.178
nobody left
to take care of them.

43:55.256 --> 43:57.190
They'll die, too.

43:57.258 --> 43:59.692
Look at my arm.
It's happening to me.

43:59.760 --> 44:03.196
- He's telling the truth.
- They're Grups!

44:03.264 --> 44:06.290
Bunk bunk!
Bunk bunk!

44:06.367 --> 44:09.359
Bunk bunk!
Bunk bunk!

44:09.436 --> 44:11.666
You want a foolie?
All right.

44:11.739 --> 44:13.707
I dare you.

44:15.709 --> 44:17.643
I double-dare you.

44:19.547 --> 44:21.845
Look at the blood
on my face.

44:21.916 --> 44:23.941
Blood on your hands.

44:24.018 --> 44:25.952
Now who's doing the hurting?

44:26.020 --> 44:28.113
Not the Grups.

44:28.189 --> 44:30.350
It's you hurting, yelling,
maybe killing,

44:30.424 --> 44:33.393
just like the Grups
and creatures you're afraid of.

44:33.460 --> 44:38.124
You're acting like them,
and you're going to bejust like them

44:38.199 --> 44:40.463
unless you let me help you.

44:40.534 --> 44:42.525
I'm a Grup...

44:44.538 --> 44:47.336
and I want to help you.

44:47.408 --> 44:50.900
I'm begging you.
Let me help you,

44:50.978 --> 44:54.175
or there won't be anything
left at all.

44:56.517 --> 44:58.576
Please.

45:03.123 --> 45:06.058
We can't wait for those communicators
any longer.

45:06.126 --> 45:10.563
- We must. The vaccine could be fatal.
- The disease certainly is.

45:10.631 --> 45:13.566
How long do we have left--
hours, minutes?

45:13.634 --> 45:16.569
How much longer
do you want to wait?

45:18.806 --> 45:23.072
Bickering is pointless.
I'll check on the captain's progress.

46:09.523 --> 46:11.457
Spock!

46:30.210 --> 46:32.405
Is he dead, Mr. Spock?

46:32.479 --> 46:34.413
Not yet.

46:43.123 --> 46:45.591
- 3 hours, 11 minutes left.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

46:45.659 --> 46:48.651
Keep this channel open.
Clear your computers.

46:56.704 --> 47:00.140
- What happened to McCoy?
- He injected himself with the vaccine.

47:00.207 --> 47:03.233
He was unconscious
when I found him.

47:05.779 --> 47:07.713
Look at his face.

47:13.420 --> 47:16.218
The blemishes are fading.

47:18.859 --> 47:20.986
[Spock]
They're fading.

47:50.157 --> 47:52.819
Who will understand
the medical mind?

48:05.339 --> 48:09.537
Is this supposed to be
a good thing, Miri?

48:09.610 --> 48:11.544
Of course it is.

48:22.222 --> 48:26.158
They were just children. To leave them
there with a medical team--

48:26.226 --> 48:29.161
just children--
300 years old and more.

48:29.229 --> 48:31.163
I've already contacted
space central.

48:31.231 --> 48:34.462
- They'll send teachers, advisers.
- And truant officers, I presume.

48:34.535 --> 48:36.469
They'll be all right.

48:36.537 --> 48:38.528
Miri--

48:38.605 --> 48:40.800
she really loved you, you know.

48:43.243 --> 48:45.268
Yes.

48:46.346 --> 48:49.611
I never get involved
with older women, yeoman.

48:55.522 --> 48:57.456
- Mr. Spock?
- Captain?

48:57.524 --> 49:00.357
Full ahead.
Warp factor 1 .

49:00.427 --> 49:02.395
Warp factor 1 , Captain.
