WEBVTT

00:47.005 --> 00:49.214
Satler.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.216
Reiss.

00:51.426 --> 00:52.426
Maloney.

00:54.804 --> 00:57.222
Murphy.
Where the hell's Murphy?

01:06.858 --> 01:10.819
-Hey, Jafo! Go find Murphy.
-Yes, sir.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.792
Sir, Lieutenant Kress
wants you on the pad.

01:26.211 --> 01:29.671
Sir?

01:31.132 --> 01:32.674
Lose something?

01:32.926 --> 01:35.177
No. You're wanted on the pad.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.854
-Mind if l ask what you're doing?
-No.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.148
I don't mind at all.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.199
Murph, feeling any pressure?

01:57.450 --> 02:00.994
Yeah, about 1 5 pounds per
square inch at sea level.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.955
Where's Montoya?

02:03.206 --> 02:06.834
Don't you check the duty board?
He's on days.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.377
I forgot.

02:08.586 --> 02:12.172
You're flying with
that new guy, Lymangood.

02:12.423 --> 02:16.301
-The what?
-Me. Lymangood.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.429
Outstanding.

02:21.182 --> 02:24.560
Captain Maloney and Officer Reiss,
report to Operations.

02:32.777 --> 02:35.112
If it was me, l'd ground him.

02:35.363 --> 02:36.738
He'll be all right.

02:36.990 --> 02:41.118
Personally, I wouldn't fly with him
for a bull that pissed Jack Daniels.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.412
Is that right?

03:08.229 --> 03:10.772
-All set?
-Yeah. Yes, sir.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.399
-You sure now?
-Yeah.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.871
Airship-1 2 rolling out at 1 959 hours.

03:26.122 --> 03:29.124
No, make that 2000 hours.
Murphy and Lymangood.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.792
Where the hell's Montoya?

03:31.044 --> 03:34.922
They say he put in for days after
that wingding that Murphy threw.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.507
No shit. Let me call Departure.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.760
L.A. Departure Control,
Air-1 2 out at...

03:40.011 --> 03:43.555
...22000. VFR 5000 will be
coming to you 1 .25.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.391
Traffic advisory.

03:48.561 --> 03:51.146
Lymangood. Lymangood...

03:51.397 --> 03:53.273
...what brings you to Air Support?

03:53.524 --> 03:54.691
Oh, l don't know.

03:54.901 --> 03:59.112
I just put in for observer.
I kind of liked the idea of it.

03:59.364 --> 04:03.742
No guns. No kicking in doors.
You know, just quiet.

04:04.827 --> 04:06.411
Oh, yeah.

04:07.121 --> 04:11.124
All these people! What do you
suppose they're all doing down there?

04:11.376 --> 04:16.088
According to the latest statistics,
1 ,000,775,000 of them...

04:16.673 --> 04:18.507
...are getting it on.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.468
That many, huh?

04:21.719 --> 04:24.263
The rest are waiting
for Laverne and Shirley.

04:24.514 --> 04:27.474
Well, let's see what we can see here.

04:29.018 --> 04:31.270
I got a black guy in a beanie.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.189
Looks like he's selling
dope out of a van.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.317
-ls that a red beanie?
-Yeah, that's him.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.486
This is primo, man.
You want it?

04:40.363 --> 04:43.573
He's ours. Undercover Buy Program.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.575
Right, right.

04:46.494 --> 04:50.080
-You were at the briefing?
-Yes, sir. Guess I just forgot.

04:51.332 --> 04:52.708
You're gonna fit right in.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.210
Air-1 2, we have
a 21 1 in progress...

04:55.461 --> 04:57.629
...at Burbank and Vineland.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.674
Male Negro,
orange shirt and cowboy hat.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.926
He's armed and has a hostage.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.178
Well, call it in.

05:05.430 --> 05:09.057
Air-1 2 to Central. Proceeding to
the 21 1 at Burbank and Vineland.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.561
Let's get out of here, man!

05:14.355 --> 05:15.731
Bitch!

05:21.863 --> 05:22.863
You dumb idiot!

05:32.540 --> 05:34.916
Air-1 2 to ground,
your guy's heading for the junkyard.

05:37.837 --> 05:42.090
Orange shirt and a cowboy hat, huh?
Whatever happened to inconspicuous?

05:44.927 --> 05:46.928
Hit him! Hit him with the light.

05:48.681 --> 05:49.681
I got him.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.313
-Jesus Christ!
-Welcome to Air Support.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.372
-Call an ambulance.
-Right.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.589
Look at that guy.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.926
Ground units! A man with
a gun is behind that dumpster.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.469
No, the other way!

06:27.720 --> 06:29.596
We're going down.
We gotta dust him.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.240
Hit the ground, son. Hit it!

06:50.827 --> 06:53.662
Code 4. They got it knocked.

07:12.932 --> 07:16.810
Sir, what was that business
with the watch?

07:19.564 --> 07:22.023
Back in the Ready Room,
with the watch?

07:22.608 --> 07:24.234
Sort of a test.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.653
If you think you're going
over the edge...

07:26.904 --> 07:28.947
...you lose your sense of time.

07:29.198 --> 07:32.659
With your eyes shut, you can't
tell 25 seconds from 5.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.162
I get it, sir. Yes, sir.

07:35.371 --> 07:38.373
Stop calling me "sir."
You sound like David Copperfield.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.333
Yes, sir. I mean, okay, sir.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.211
Check that ride at 1 0:00.

07:44.338 --> 07:46.214
-Which one?
-Underneath the tree.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.341
How do you see that shit?

07:52.346 --> 07:53.722
-See it?
-Yep.

07:55.224 --> 07:57.976
-lt's got no plates on it.
-Well, call it in.

07:58.227 --> 07:59.978
Abandoned vehicle.

08:00.813 --> 08:05.025
Air-1 2 to Central. Reporting
an abandoned vehicle. lt's a--

08:05.276 --> 08:06.693
Come on, what kind of car?

08:06.944 --> 08:09.196
It's a light tan Chevy.

08:09.447 --> 08:12.407
It's got no front plates.
It's got no plates at all.

08:13.993 --> 08:17.120
It's near the top of the hill
on Linden Road.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.789
Very good.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.249
Oh, thanks.

08:43.105 --> 08:46.107
What time have you got?
You got about 1 0:30?

08:46.359 --> 08:48.777
Been talking to Montoya, haven't you?

08:49.070 --> 08:52.113
Well, he did mention
something about Encino.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.783
I suppose you deserve
full initiation.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.452
You might as well
have your picture taken.

09:21.477 --> 09:24.563
Montoya thinks she's
some kind of movie actress.

09:25.147 --> 09:28.984
Just my damn luck if they
had her working overtime tonight.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.319
Those bastards.

09:32.363 --> 09:34.406
Slave drivers.
That's what they are.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.701
They don't care how hard
they work you, as long--

09:37.952 --> 09:40.245
Oh, my God! There she is.

09:45.585 --> 09:49.713
She's fantastic! Do you think
she knows we're out here?

09:49.964 --> 09:52.132
All she has to do is look
out the window.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.384
1 0:30, right on the dot!

09:55.761 --> 10:00.682
If there's one quality that l admire
in a person, it's punctuality.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.103
And flexibility.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.733
If a person says that they're
gonna be at a certain place--

10:09.942 --> 10:11.318
Oh, God!

10:13.279 --> 10:17.240
How does she do that?
How does she do that?

10:17.491 --> 10:19.284
Beats the hell out of me.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.119
Don't push on the pedals!

10:24.790 --> 10:27.000
Would you look at her tan?

10:32.923 --> 10:35.133
It's so even!

10:37.053 --> 10:39.512
Oh, my God!

11:28.521 --> 11:31.272
-What do you want?
-Get the briefcase!

11:31.816 --> 11:33.316
I think she doesn't know.

11:40.616 --> 11:41.991
Somebody does.

11:42.243 --> 11:46.496
All units in the vicinity handle a rape
in progress. 8792 Linden Road.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.415
Damn it to hell. I knew it!

11:48.666 --> 11:50.125
Identify and handle, code 3.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.430
Oh, shit! Come on, let's go, man!

12:05.641 --> 12:06.766
Around the back.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.228
Hold it! Freeze!

12:26.579 --> 12:28.371
He's bought it.
Get on the other guy.

12:32.626 --> 12:35.378
No, let them go!
Please, let them go!

12:37.381 --> 12:38.923
-Over there.
-l got him.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.672
Sir, you okay? Sir?

13:20.341 --> 13:22.217
Fine.

13:26.931 --> 13:27.931
Get an ambulance.

13:28.182 --> 13:32.227
Air-1 2 requesting an ambulance
at 3920 Linden Road.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.230
-How's the woman?
-She looks bad.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.650
Oh, hell! lt's gone.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.694
The Chevy. The junker.
The Chevy.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.489
It's gone.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.707
For God's sake!

13:56.961 --> 14:01.381
Air-1 2, wind 1 50 degrees at 22,
clear to land.

14:02.633 --> 14:06.219
Air-14, 1 1 50 degrees at 1 2,
clear for takeoff.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.973
The old man wants to see
both of you. Right now!

14:14.103 --> 14:17.647
-l like your haircut.
-l like yours too.

14:30.870 --> 14:35.206
You know, one of the really
fun things about this job...

14:35.457 --> 14:38.918
...is reading the complaints
of the public.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.505
For example, tonight here
we have a fella...

14:42.756 --> 14:46.634
...that didn't appreciate us
disturbing his sleep.

14:48.262 --> 14:52.682
I just hope l'm not called on
by the chief to explain...

14:52.892 --> 14:57.604
...why two of my people were
hovering over Encino at 1 0:30...

14:57.855 --> 15:00.899
...while Commissioner McNeely
was getting beaten...

15:01.108 --> 15:04.360
...in her own front yard
in fashionable Brentwood.

15:06.655 --> 15:08.114
McNeely? That's her?

15:08.324 --> 15:11.075
Of the mayor's Task Force
on Urban Violence.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.162
A touch of irony, if you
like that sort of thing.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.123
-How is she?
-She was shot, Frank.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.668
She's in lntensive Care.
Shot by one of the rapists.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.129
One of the rapists?

15:23.422 --> 15:26.716
Assault. Attempted rape.
That's what they're calling it.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.134
There wasn't any rape.

15:28.385 --> 15:31.095
Case is closed.
There's two toes tagged in the morgue.

15:31.347 --> 15:35.224
That abandoned car we called in?
The Chevy. That was a stakeout.

15:35.476 --> 15:39.604
No stakeout. A make-out.
Kids who couldn't afford a motel.

15:39.855 --> 15:43.066
Kids go to Mulholland.
That's not the pattern.

15:43.317 --> 15:46.444
Forget patterns, Frank.
And get the hell off my desk, will you?

15:47.154 --> 15:48.571
Get off!

15:52.201 --> 15:53.576
All right.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.621
It doesn't bother you
that car has no plates?

15:56.872 --> 15:58.998
That it wasn't there
when we came back?

15:59.249 --> 16:00.917
That rapists don't travel in pairs?

16:01.168 --> 16:05.713
What bothers me is, some son of
a bitch may ask what you were doing...

16:05.965 --> 16:08.925
...five miles out of your patrol area!

16:09.176 --> 16:11.094
When I talk to you,
I'll look at you.

16:11.345 --> 16:14.639
It was my fault. I talked
Murphy into taking us there.

16:14.848 --> 16:18.601
You're supposed to be stupid, son.
Don't abuse the privilege.

16:18.894 --> 16:22.563
You think I haven't heard about
that silly twit out in Encino?

16:22.773 --> 16:27.902
I had 20 years in this outfit when
you were sitting in front of the TV...

16:28.237 --> 16:31.781
...watching Bugs Bunny,
gnawing on your Fudgsicle.

16:34.743 --> 16:39.706
Remember, Officer Murphy, there are
people who don't like police officers.

16:39.957 --> 16:44.544
They do not like the idea of
helicopters flying over their homes...

16:44.753 --> 16:46.462
...peeking in their windows.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.340
You know what they'll do?
They'll burn you...

16:49.591 --> 16:53.261
...me, your idiotic friend here,
and my whole damn division.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.138
I don't want my division burnt!

16:55.389 --> 16:57.765
So here's the way it's coming down
with you guys!

16:58.934 --> 17:01.769
-You're grounded. Both of you!
-Grounded?

17:02.021 --> 17:05.940
I gotta figure out where to hide you
until this crap blows over.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.276
Get out of here, Lymangood.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.737
I mean, dismissed.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.784
Stick around, Frank.

17:22.708 --> 17:26.586
The review board wants to have you
up for psychiatric re-evaluation.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.171
Oh, come on!

17:28.422 --> 17:31.257
What do you expect after your
wig-out last month?

17:34.136 --> 17:37.889
But there's a bright side
to this. And a moral.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.600
Morals are good for you.
I love morals.

17:40.851 --> 17:45.646
And the moral of this story is:
If you are walking on eggs, don't hop.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.233
That's it.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.706
Don't hop!

19:27.332 --> 19:30.251
Hello. Listen, it's me.

19:30.460 --> 19:35.047
I don't know whether a post card from
Laguna means we're speaking again...

19:36.300 --> 19:38.676
...but call me when you get in, okay?

19:38.927 --> 19:43.598
Even if you're not speaking, call me.
Please? Okay, huh? Please, huh?

19:48.061 --> 19:50.771
Hello. l'm back.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.399
Is there no getting
rid of this chick?

19:54.693 --> 19:59.280
The reason I'm pressing is that
I've got a really big favor l need.

19:59.489 --> 20:01.949
I'm desperate! Desperate!

20:02.910 --> 20:05.620
No matter what time it is, call me.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.206
Please. Bye.

20:33.649 --> 20:34.941
Freeze!

20:35.192 --> 20:36.484
For chrissake, Murphy!

20:39.738 --> 20:41.572
You wanna get yourself killed?

20:41.823 --> 20:45.660
You bozo! How many burglars come
in the front door with a key?

20:45.911 --> 20:49.163
-You scared the shit out of me.
-l'm sorry.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.748
Came to make friends.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.087
Here's your key.

20:59.299 --> 21:01.801
Well, l guess that makes
that official.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.180
Where's my blender? I need it.

21:07.891 --> 21:08.975
At 3:00 a.m.?

21:09.226 --> 21:12.436
You have this problem.
You don't return phone calls.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.146
In the kitchen.

21:16.608 --> 21:17.817
Hold him for me.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.612
This kid must be deaf.

21:22.531 --> 21:26.325
-You coming?
-Where?

21:26.576 --> 21:29.203
The Shocks' anniversary party.
You remember.

21:29.454 --> 21:33.499
Annie's been open for a year now.
We're gonna have guacamole...

21:33.750 --> 21:36.043
...and margaritas...

21:36.253 --> 21:38.504
...and chili rellenos--

21:41.300 --> 21:43.509
Fat chance, huh?

21:45.053 --> 21:47.471
That must've been some leave
you had in Laguna.

21:47.681 --> 21:50.808
What did you do? Spend all your
time on the pistol range?

21:51.518 --> 21:53.185
Here it is!

21:55.814 --> 21:57.898
What's this?

22:04.865 --> 22:07.158
This is beautiful. Really!

22:09.453 --> 22:11.912
-Could I please borrow this--?
-No.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.205
I'll wash it.

22:13.457 --> 22:16.667
It already belongs to you.
I bought it for your birthday.

22:16.918 --> 22:19.420
-Really?
-l thought l gave you that damn thing.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.715
Never mind. This is beautiful.
I love it!

22:26.428 --> 22:28.554
Frank, l miss you.

22:28.805 --> 22:30.514
I don't eat. I don't seem to sleep.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.975
Maybe you ought to trade me
in on a surfer.

22:33.226 --> 22:37.938
Well, l tried that once,
but it didn't work.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.067
Come to think of it, neither did he.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.110
Good night, Murphy.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.740
Good night, you little faker.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.451
Watch your legs.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.497
Frank...

22:57.209 --> 22:59.210
...we gotta get serious.

23:00.962 --> 23:03.964
Now, l know you have a lot
of problems right now...

23:04.174 --> 23:06.926
...and l'd really like to help you.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.678
"You can run, but you can't hide."

23:09.888 --> 23:14.225
-Joe Louis. That's very good.
-That's what I mean!

23:14.434 --> 23:19.063
Frank, l'm gonna have to get tough
on you. Are you ready for that?

23:19.856 --> 23:21.315
I'm ready.

23:47.884 --> 23:52.096
Five, four, three, two, one....

23:52.347 --> 23:53.973
Cue Mario, take one.

23:54.224 --> 23:58.853
The top story is still the assault
and attempted rape of Diana McNeely...

23:59.104 --> 24:01.647
...of the mayor's
Task Force on Urban Violence.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.983
McNeely's still on
the critical list.

24:04.192 --> 24:06.986
We spoke to Chief Jensen
about the latest news.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.947
We have nothing
on the two assailants.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.616
They were without identification...

24:12.868 --> 24:16.495
...probably Latin American and almost
certainly illegal aliens.

24:16.746 --> 24:19.707
Our fingerprint teams are going
over their car...

24:19.958 --> 24:23.043
...which was stolen from
a Santa Monica parking lot.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.589
It is unclear what impact
this incident will have...

24:26.840 --> 24:31.177
...on the minority community, and
the increasing racial tensions that--

24:31.928 --> 24:33.596
We've just received word...

24:33.805 --> 24:37.850
...that Alf Hewitt is standing by
St. Joseph's for a live report.

24:38.101 --> 24:41.103
Commissioner Diana McNeely
died at 8:47 a.m...

24:41.354 --> 24:44.773
...from a gunshot wound
which penetrated her neck...

24:45.025 --> 24:48.152
...and lodged beneath
the third cervical vertebrae.

24:48.361 --> 24:49.987
She never regained
consciousness...

24:50.238 --> 24:53.115
...and if she had lived,
would've been paralysed.

24:53.366 --> 24:56.410
This is Alf Hewitt,
from St. Joseph's Hospital.

26:18.994 --> 26:22.621
I've been trying to reach you. Why
don't you answer your beeper?

26:22.872 --> 26:27.585
I just want to tell you that next time
I'm suspended, so's my fucking beeper!

26:28.295 --> 26:31.046
-Feel better?
-Yeah, a little.

26:31.298 --> 26:35.259
Get down here. We just came
up with a mince pie under each arm.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.396
You're back on flying status.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.733
You're assigned a special detail.

26:53.528 --> 26:57.156
This is Mr. Icelan.
Mr. Fletcher of Washington.

26:57.365 --> 26:58.574
This is Frank Murphy.

26:58.825 --> 27:03.412
We're glad we found you. We're due
at the weapons testing range at--

27:03.622 --> 27:06.373
-What do they call that place?
-Pinkville.

27:07.083 --> 27:10.210
Everything I'm about to tell
you is highly classified.

27:10.420 --> 27:14.923
Don't discuss it with anybody. We're
testing a new helicopter prototype.

27:15.133 --> 27:17.468
We've got our own pilot...

27:17.677 --> 27:20.763
...but your city's been chosen
as the testing area...

27:21.014 --> 27:24.266
...and your mayor is anxious that
his people participate.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.268
Ours is not to reason why...

27:26.478 --> 27:30.356
...ours is but to submit
to the vagaries of local politicians.

27:50.043 --> 27:51.543
Smoke? Frank, is it?

27:52.671 --> 27:53.879
No. Yes.

27:55.256 --> 27:57.341
No: smoke. Yes: Frank.

28:01.513 --> 28:05.849
I understand you flew in Nam, Frank.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.476
That's right.

28:08.269 --> 28:10.771
-Two tours, was it?
-One and a half.

28:11.398 --> 28:12.773
Why the foreshortened tour?

28:13.024 --> 28:15.818
You know what they say about
a second chest wound.

28:16.027 --> 28:18.529
It's nature's way of telling you
it's time to go home.

28:18.697 --> 28:19.863
Yeah, right. Right.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.865
You gonna tell us
about this special detail?

28:22.075 --> 28:25.828
A lot of people are looking
forward to the Olympics out here.

28:26.037 --> 28:30.624
For a few short weeks, the attention
of the world will be on this town.

28:30.875 --> 28:32.751
Every nutcase and terrorist...

28:32.961 --> 28:36.964
...and crazy with a pipe bomb and
a cause is drooling about it.

28:37.215 --> 28:39.383
That's what this detail's all about.

28:39.592 --> 28:42.094
The potential for catastrophe.

28:42.595 --> 28:45.305
We don't want any Munich
massacres out here, Frank.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.600
Are you talking about
crowd control from the air?

28:48.852 --> 28:51.061
Give that man a cigar.

28:51.688 --> 28:54.106
That's been tried.
It didn't work out so hot.

28:54.357 --> 28:56.275
-Where was that?
-Vietnam.

28:59.487 --> 29:01.488
We added a few new wrinkles.

29:01.698 --> 29:05.242
-Such as?
-You'll see, Frank. You'll see.

29:25.430 --> 29:30.100
This thing has antiterrorist
capabilities. You saying it's armed?

29:30.351 --> 29:33.479
That I am. That it is.

29:33.688 --> 29:35.898
That sounds like it now.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.026
It's illegal to arm
police helicopters.

29:39.235 --> 29:42.029
That would depend on the
circumstances, wouldn't it?

29:42.238 --> 29:44.448
A lot of people ain't gonna like this.

29:45.283 --> 29:47.367
What do you call this,
an "airbuster"?

29:47.619 --> 29:50.871
The Special. But somebody hung
a nickname on it.

29:51.080 --> 29:54.249
-What?
-Somebody hung a nickname on it.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.335
Blue Thunder.

30:27.283 --> 30:30.744
Okay, gentlemen, you wanna
take your seats? Here she comes.

30:33.748 --> 30:36.375
She don't look normal...

30:36.584 --> 30:40.754
...she don't fly normal,
because she ain't normal.

30:51.766 --> 30:53.976
This whole ship is heavily armored...

30:54.227 --> 30:58.146
...with Nordoc NATO armor
one inch thick.

30:58.356 --> 31:03.360
This ship is equipped with a forward
mounted 20 mm electric cannon.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.446
Its six barrels are capable...

31:06.614 --> 31:11.952
...of firing 4000 rounds
of ammunition per minute.

31:12.120 --> 31:16.456
And that, gentlemen, is one hell of
a shit storm in anybody's language.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.167
Now, let's take a look...

31:19.419 --> 31:22.045
...and watch the lady strut her stuff.

31:27.552 --> 31:32.639
The red dummies are terrorists, white
are civilians. Innocent bystanders.

31:36.436 --> 31:38.812
The object is for our pilot
to knock out...

31:39.063 --> 31:41.440
...the red dummies and the black cars.

31:41.649 --> 31:44.359
He shouldn't touch any of the others.

31:45.653 --> 31:48.947
In a riot situation, we just
want to get the bad guys...

31:49.157 --> 31:50.949
...and protect the innocents.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.512
Oh, my God!

32:14.223 --> 32:18.977
That kind of firepower would be
used in our worst-case scenario...

32:19.187 --> 32:20.729
...like armed insurrection.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.565
It's comforting to know
you got it on tap.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.651
Gentlemen, let me have your attention.

32:25.902 --> 32:27.861
Notice the selectivity of the firing.

32:28.112 --> 32:31.573
This is not a strafing run
where you tear up a whole street.

32:31.783 --> 32:35.744
This little lady picks her targets
carefully. Now you watch.

33:08.611 --> 33:11.780
Look at that. All the red
dummies are blown to hell.

33:12.031 --> 33:13.281
And a few white ones.

33:13.533 --> 33:18.203
One civilian dead for every 1 0
terrorists. An acceptable ratio.

33:18.871 --> 33:21.039
Unless you're one of the civilians.

33:21.290 --> 33:26.336
All right. Last pass, gentlemen.
Anybody wanna bet on the school bus?

33:47.775 --> 33:50.152
We haven't told our pilot
everything about the bus.

33:50.403 --> 33:53.905
Let's see if he can pick up
on what's wrong with it.

34:19.474 --> 34:20.806
Damn it! Bloody gun!

34:38.409 --> 34:41.578
Now, if you come down below,
we'll take a closer look...

34:41.829 --> 34:45.581
...and l'll be glad to answer
any questions you may have.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.898
Terrific shooting, colonel.
It was beautiful.

35:10.149 --> 35:11.691
Beautiful, was it?

35:11.943 --> 35:14.694
Goddamn it! l had another stoppage.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.701
I nearly killed you
on that second pass.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.579
If it happens again,
I'll have their balls.

35:24.831 --> 35:27.040
There's somebody l want you to meet.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.167
Well, what do you know!

35:30.086 --> 35:31.294
Friend of yours?

35:31.546 --> 35:36.508
An old war buddy. The bastard tried
to have me court-martialled once.

35:36.759 --> 35:37.926
Sorry l brought it up.

35:38.177 --> 35:39.386
Look who it isn't.

35:39.595 --> 35:42.639
Colonel, this is Captain
Braddock of Astro Division.

35:42.849 --> 35:46.434
And Frank Murphy. He'll do
the actual testing over the city.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.271
Finally made colonel?

35:49.647 --> 35:51.982
If you're nice, nice things
happen to you.

35:52.233 --> 35:54.401
I'll try to remember that.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.697
Step this way for any questions.

36:01.909 --> 36:03.660
How did we draw him?

36:03.870 --> 36:06.037
He and his observer
were assigned to us.

36:06.247 --> 36:09.875
-l didn't realize you were acquainted.
-Only too well, l'm afraid.

36:10.126 --> 36:13.795
I'd have had him up on charges
if he hadn't caught some shrapnel.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.798
He's totally unsuitable
for our purpose.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.633
I'll call Mr. Holmes tonight.

36:18.885 --> 36:21.344
Don't bother him.
I think we can handle it.

36:21.596 --> 36:25.932
--30 million candlepower
night sun with an infrared filter.

36:26.184 --> 36:29.352
Over here is your TV camera,
with 1 00-to-1 zoom lens.

36:30.271 --> 36:34.482
-We could've used this in Nam.
-We could've used something.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.735
Do you think you can fly it?

36:37.653 --> 36:39.654
You flew it, didn't you?

36:42.241 --> 36:43.909
I'll check you out myself.

36:44.160 --> 36:47.162
Be on the pad, 12 sharp.

36:47.872 --> 36:49.039
Twelve sharp.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.375
Catch you later.

36:53.419 --> 36:55.295
Stand back from there.

36:55.588 --> 36:58.506
Irritating little cocksucker,
isn't he?

37:07.308 --> 37:10.936
-Hey. Tequila breath!
-My man in the sky.

37:11.187 --> 37:15.065
-How do you like day shifts?
-My bride's happier. But me?

37:15.316 --> 37:18.902
-What's happening?
-l gotta go take a flight check.

37:19.153 --> 37:21.154
What do you make of this?

37:21.739 --> 37:22.739
What it is?

37:22.990 --> 37:25.659
I found it where
Diana McNeely was killed.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.662
I think it's about
that urban violence stuff.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.747
Can you translate this?
It's in Spanish.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.667
I gotta log in, but l'll
get back to you later.

37:33.876 --> 37:35.377
Keep it under your hat.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.754
Right under the hat.
Look at this!

37:38.005 --> 37:40.215
I gotta get dressed.
I'll see you in a second.

37:40.383 --> 37:42.259
Hey, how you doing?
Thanks for the hat.

37:42.468 --> 37:44.719
-How's it going?
-What's this "JAFO" shit?

37:44.929 --> 37:49.307
Look up. Look down.
Look left. Look right.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.268
-Don't worry.
-What's JAFO?

37:53.980 --> 37:56.147
You know what Montoya told me?

37:56.357 --> 37:59.567
He told me you looped one
of those things. A helicopter.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.945
He's putting me on, right?

38:02.196 --> 38:03.280
No, he wasn't.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.365
You actually looped a chopper?

38:05.616 --> 38:07.450
-That's right.
-When?

38:07.702 --> 38:10.370
When I was young and stupid.

38:23.342 --> 38:27.304
You're telling me it was
a complete 360? Right over the top?

38:27.555 --> 38:30.307
-A full loop.
-l thought that was impossible.

38:30.558 --> 38:33.393
It is.
It's aerodynamically impossible.

38:33.602 --> 38:36.604
Anyone who tells you any
different is a damn liar.

38:38.607 --> 38:41.276
Now, you take the Ranger
and l'll be in my bird.

38:41.527 --> 38:44.779
We'll have a little game.
Follow my leader.

38:45.614 --> 38:47.240
Follow my leader.

38:48.200 --> 38:52.162
Catch you later.

38:59.378 --> 39:01.796
Murphy, this is Cochrane.

39:02.048 --> 39:06.092
Join formation with me, echelon
right. And keep it tight.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.385
Roger that, colonel.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.890
Wanna show me that loop, Murphy?

39:13.976 --> 39:15.101
Negatory.

39:15.353 --> 39:19.439
I thought so.
Okay, slide over to my left.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.622
Come on, keep it tight.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.248
Christ!

39:37.500 --> 39:40.251
Any closer, we start eating blades.

39:40.961 --> 39:43.380
We're following his leader.

39:50.179 --> 39:53.181
Now push it over and pick up speed.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.858
Follow me through
a high-speed climbing turn.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.794
Level out at 500 feet.

40:29.009 --> 40:32.220
All right, Mr. Murphy.
You take the lead.

40:33.055 --> 40:34.055
Roger that.

40:54.493 --> 40:55.785
Damn! Damn it! Shit!

40:56.036 --> 40:57.620
We got a runaway!

40:58.581 --> 40:59.747
Jeez! What was that?

41:04.128 --> 41:06.087
Grab your ankles
and kiss your ass goodbye.

41:06.255 --> 41:07.547
-We're going down.
-Shit!

41:11.886 --> 41:13.094
Mayday! Mayday!

41:13.345 --> 41:14.721
We're going down.

41:14.972 --> 41:19.100
Willowbrook and Alameda.
Request ambulance, fire.

41:22.688 --> 41:24.397
Shut the fuel off.
Shut the fuel off!

41:24.565 --> 41:26.900
What? Fuel?

41:37.244 --> 41:38.244
Heads up!

41:38.496 --> 41:40.413
Jesus! Where'd that bus come from?

41:40.664 --> 41:42.916
Steady. We're gonna
make a house call.

41:57.848 --> 42:00.099
Central, this is Blue Thunder.

42:00.267 --> 42:05.104
It seems that we have a ship down,
somewhere in the Watts area.

42:11.612 --> 42:13.112
Are you all right?

42:14.406 --> 42:16.449
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.243
Get the hell off me!

42:34.134 --> 42:36.678
I hope you broke your fucking neck!

42:38.430 --> 42:40.431
You could've killed half of my crew!

42:40.641 --> 42:44.435
You knocked down the whole damn
shack! Get the hell out of here!

42:47.815 --> 42:50.525
-Listen, Dick. Thanks a lot.
-Be careful.

42:50.776 --> 42:52.527
-Take care.
-See you.

43:03.122 --> 43:06.958
Rather a near thing today.
I heard your turbine failed.

43:07.209 --> 43:08.376
Or was it your flying?

43:09.211 --> 43:10.628
Back off, asshole.

43:11.589 --> 43:14.841
What's that l hear? Threats?

43:15.134 --> 43:18.595
Well, what a change.
We are acting brave nowadays.

43:20.931 --> 43:22.640
Are you threatening me, Murphy?

43:22.850 --> 43:26.644
No, I'm telling you. Back off.

43:27.688 --> 43:28.688
Catch you later.

43:57.676 --> 44:00.928
-Can l see your watch?
-Sure.

44:02.014 --> 44:03.848
You know where it is, don't you?

44:04.767 --> 44:05.975
Are you losing weight?

44:06.226 --> 44:09.062
Getting older too. l think you
have to turn up here.

44:09.271 --> 44:10.730
Getting enough sleep?

44:10.939 --> 44:14.192
Are we having two different
conversations or l am going nuts?

44:14.443 --> 44:17.945
The train ride. The train ride.
I'll find it.

44:18.197 --> 44:21.407
-lf you don't run out of gas first.
-What?

44:21.659 --> 44:25.161
When that needle points to empty,
it means you're out of gas.

44:25.412 --> 44:27.413
That's broken.
We got plenty.

44:27.665 --> 44:30.958
Mommy! You missed the train ride.

44:32.086 --> 44:33.461
Hang on.

44:36.256 --> 44:39.092
-Are you crazy?
-This a one-way street!

44:39.301 --> 44:41.302
I won't tell if you won't tell!

44:44.431 --> 44:46.265
Jeez, look out!

44:54.483 --> 44:56.943
I'll tell you one thing,
it's awfully hard to read.

44:57.194 --> 44:59.362
-Yeah, I know.
-lt's part of a letter.

44:59.613 --> 45:04.242
It says something about strangers
in the barrio making trouble.

45:04.493 --> 45:07.620
I don't know. Something
like that. Here's a word...

45:07.871 --> 45:10.623
...that isn't in Spanish:
"Thor."

45:10.874 --> 45:13.334
T-H-O-R.

45:13.585 --> 45:16.212
-Thor? No.
-Mean anything?

45:17.923 --> 45:21.634
Strangers in the barrio
making trouble.

45:25.222 --> 45:26.222
I don't know.

45:26.432 --> 45:31.561
Maybe I've been in this too long, but
I think something bad's coming down.

45:31.812 --> 45:35.606
Most of the official family
of Los Angeles, led by the mayor...

45:35.816 --> 45:39.110
...and the City Council, gathered
with family members...

45:39.319 --> 45:42.530
...and members of the black community
at McNeely's funeral...

45:42.781 --> 45:45.825
...who was tragically murdered
several days ago.

45:46.076 --> 45:47.076
Food's up!

45:47.244 --> 45:49.996
McNeely, who chaired
the Commission on Urban Violence...

45:50.247 --> 45:53.583
...was an outspoken critic of
police department policies.

45:54.042 --> 45:57.211
The chief was in evidence as were
many of his aides.

45:57.671 --> 46:00.882
As temperatures stay high
and tempers continue to fray...

46:01.133 --> 46:03.885
...fires continue in
the Watts area...

46:04.136 --> 46:07.930
...the City of lndustry, Pacoima
and East Los Angeles.

46:08.766 --> 46:11.267
You want ketchup on your sandwich?

46:15.522 --> 46:17.315
Now where did he go?

46:17.524 --> 46:19.192
Hey, Frank.

46:19.359 --> 46:22.111
Frank, did you say you wanted--?

46:25.949 --> 46:27.575
Frank?

46:28.994 --> 46:31.078
Frank, are you okay?

46:43.342 --> 46:45.051
Frank.

46:47.513 --> 46:49.847
Is this something kinky?

46:55.938 --> 46:58.523
Goddamn your black Irish heart...

46:58.732 --> 47:01.734
...Frances McNeil Murphy,
if you've left!

48:08.927 --> 48:12.221
These are your television monitors.
You have three.

48:12.431 --> 48:15.474
The one in the center ties into
all your computer banks.

48:16.059 --> 48:17.560
The switches:

48:17.811 --> 48:19.353
Night vision.

48:19.605 --> 48:22.189
Infrared filter. Target system.

48:23.150 --> 48:25.651
Whisper mode
so you can travel silent.

48:26.278 --> 48:30.197
Audio, which controls your
outside mikes which are here.

48:30.449 --> 48:31.657
What's the sensitivity?

48:31.909 --> 48:34.368
You can hear a mouse fart
at 2000 feet.

48:35.996 --> 48:40.124
Now, gentlemen. This is your
Harrison fire control helmet.

48:40.334 --> 48:42.877
This baby is the heart of your system.

48:43.462 --> 48:45.796
Let's take a look
and see how she works.

48:49.217 --> 48:50.217
Watch this.

48:54.222 --> 48:56.974
It superimposes the gun cues
on the real world.

48:57.225 --> 48:59.977
Wherever you look, the guns follow.

49:01.355 --> 49:03.522
You can zero in on
any target you want...

49:03.774 --> 49:06.984
...just by putting the green
tracer line on your target.

49:10.280 --> 49:13.324
-You wanna give it a shot?
-Yeah.

49:20.624 --> 49:22.083
What's that, 3/4-inch video?

49:22.334 --> 49:23.876
You know something about it?

49:24.127 --> 49:27.296
-That was my rate in the Navy.
-What ship?

49:27.506 --> 49:30.675
-Midway.
-No shit. l was on the Forrestal.

49:30.926 --> 49:33.511
It's a hell of a setup.
Let me show you.

49:33.762 --> 49:36.681
It goes in a locked memory bank
here in the belly.

49:37.683 --> 49:40.017
Each reel is code-numbered.

49:43.105 --> 49:46.816
This little bug erases the tape on
a signal from Central Command.

49:47.067 --> 49:49.777
The tape's gotta be inside
the case to erase.

49:50.112 --> 49:53.239
It only erases in the case?
That's great.

49:53.490 --> 49:56.951
Adjust for your eye until the red
dot rides on your tracer line.

49:57.202 --> 50:01.330
Then press the cannon button and zap!
Where you look is where you hit.

50:01.581 --> 50:04.250
Sunshine! Just blew your
gizzard away.

50:05.419 --> 50:09.005
What's all this shit l hear
about you threatening Cochrane?

50:10.340 --> 50:12.133
Thank you, sergeant.

50:14.469 --> 50:15.469
What?

50:15.721 --> 50:19.098
In the police garage.
After your crack-up.

50:19.349 --> 50:21.100
Feeling a little hostility?

50:21.309 --> 50:23.185
I told him to back off, that's all.

50:23.395 --> 50:25.271
That's all? Well, it's enough.

50:25.522 --> 50:30.317
They don't care if you kill yourself.
They got $5 million in this aircraft.

50:30.527 --> 50:32.611
They don't want to see it totaled.

50:32.863 --> 50:34.280
Some kind of bullshit.

50:36.783 --> 50:38.242
Hey.

50:40.287 --> 50:41.746
If you want my opinion...

50:41.955 --> 50:45.291
...l think the feds are after your ass.
Better watch it.

50:47.377 --> 50:49.253
Okay, thanks.

50:51.757 --> 50:55.509
Hey, Matusek? How do you control
the oscillation of the quartz?

50:55.719 --> 51:00.097
It's the difference between the output
of the generator signals. See?

51:00.307 --> 51:02.808
Hey, Jafo. This isn't
any night school.

51:03.060 --> 51:05.311
We got a test flight
to make out there.

51:06.855 --> 51:10.107
-Good night.
-Good night, kid. Take it easy.

51:20.035 --> 51:22.620
-Big Brother, on or off?
-What's Big Brother?

51:22.871 --> 51:25.539
The cabin mike.
It records everything we say.

51:26.166 --> 51:27.666
I think we can lose that.

51:27.918 --> 51:30.127
I got the fuse right here.

51:31.046 --> 51:33.255
Get your hat off those
circuit breakers.

51:33.507 --> 51:36.342
Tell me what JAFO is.
I'm putting the fuse here.

51:36.593 --> 51:38.969
You'll find out. Just be patient.

51:39.221 --> 51:41.889
Night vision. Checked, okay.

51:42.140 --> 51:44.517
Target systems checked, okay.

51:45.352 --> 51:48.312
Let's see what's on HBO tonight, okay?
Check.

51:49.981 --> 51:52.650
Blue Thunder to tower,
requests permission for takeoff.

51:52.901 --> 51:57.488
Blue Thunder, Tower unable to issue
departure clearance at this time.

51:57.739 --> 52:01.075
This isn't a very good idea.
He hasn't even got clearance.

52:01.326 --> 52:03.536
It's just an orientation flight.

52:04.538 --> 52:07.456
Holmes is arriving tonight.
Let him take care of it.

52:07.707 --> 52:09.583
-What do you want?
-Clear him.

52:09.835 --> 52:13.504
Blue Thunder, Tower.
Wind 330 degrees at 1 5.

52:13.713 --> 52:15.381
Clear for takeoff.

52:21.054 --> 52:23.764
Roger, Tower.
Blue Thunder off at 2030.

52:25.142 --> 52:28.310
Be coming to you.
Traffic advisories.

52:28.478 --> 52:31.021
Let's hope he knows what he's doing.

52:48.915 --> 52:49.915
How does she fly?

52:50.167 --> 52:52.293
It's nose-heavier than the ayatollah.

52:52.502 --> 52:56.046
-You're crazy. This stuff's great.
-Great, huh?

52:57.632 --> 53:01.760
-Okay, let's see what this turkey's got.
-Let's go!

53:32.125 --> 53:33.167
Hey. Hey.

53:33.335 --> 53:36.295
-Orbit right. Orbit right.
-What?

53:37.631 --> 53:38.923
-Hi, there.
-Hi.

53:39.090 --> 53:40.382
You gotta hear this.

53:40.592 --> 53:44.678
I wondered if you knew where a guy
could get something good to eat.

53:44.888 --> 53:48.349
It depends on what a guy's
hungry for. Know what l mean?

53:49.059 --> 53:50.184
I'm going to video.

53:50.977 --> 53:53.229
A little sushi would be nice.

53:53.480 --> 53:56.732
-Sushi?
-Remember the last time we did this?

53:58.151 --> 54:00.945
-Try the zoom.
-Zoom, right.

54:01.196 --> 54:03.113
Seventy--five?

54:03.365 --> 54:06.242
Are we talking about American money?

54:06.493 --> 54:08.202
We certainly are.

54:08.411 --> 54:09.828
Come on, lady. You know--

54:12.874 --> 54:15.125
Look at this. Hot Chihuahua!

54:15.377 --> 54:17.628
Honey, that's a little steep.

54:17.879 --> 54:19.922
I want it! I want it!

54:20.173 --> 54:22.967
Let's lose this asshole.
He's breaking my heart.

54:23.218 --> 54:25.135
Come on. We gotta go to work.

54:26.388 --> 54:28.097
Bye-bye.

54:36.940 --> 54:38.565
I dig this police work.

54:38.817 --> 54:40.734
Yeah. You're breathing heavy.

54:42.570 --> 54:44.530
All right, here goes the whisper mode.

54:44.781 --> 54:46.115
Whisper mode.

54:46.533 --> 54:48.033
That's a check.

54:52.872 --> 54:53.998
Hey, that's smooth!

54:54.249 --> 54:56.166
Forest Lawn.

55:00.964 --> 55:04.008
Hey. Check this place over here
at 3:30.

55:04.259 --> 55:06.343
Is that a state cycle in the driveway?

55:07.012 --> 55:09.555
-That's highway patrol.
-Can you make the licence?

55:09.806 --> 55:12.016
-Can you bring it around?
-Yeah.

55:22.027 --> 55:24.570
That's 221 Bravo 6.

55:24.821 --> 55:29.533
I know that cycle.
Jack Moran. Double Dork.

55:30.243 --> 55:31.577
Double Dork?

55:31.828 --> 55:33.078
Try that thermograph.

55:33.288 --> 55:35.581
Thermograph.
Cutting in thermograph.

55:35.832 --> 55:37.249
Coming in.

55:38.710 --> 55:40.794
The motor looks hot.

55:41.296 --> 55:43.505
It hasn't been there too long.

55:43.923 --> 55:47.468
-Want me to see if the owner's home?
-Sure. Can we do it?

55:47.719 --> 55:50.804
That guy, Matusek,
he cleared me this morning.

55:51.014 --> 55:53.515
This sucker'll do everything
but cook your breakfast.

55:54.392 --> 55:59.188
H-23.

55:59.439 --> 56:01.607
Let's see, the house is right here.

56:01.816 --> 56:04.443
-She's there!
-How does the computer know?

56:04.694 --> 56:06.987
They clear it with their
security patrol...

56:07.238 --> 56:09.615
...and then they zap it right to us.

56:16.122 --> 56:17.956
Let the good times roll!

56:23.380 --> 56:25.547
No. No.

56:25.715 --> 56:28.050
Not yet. Not yet.

56:28.593 --> 56:30.219
I'm not ready!

56:35.558 --> 56:37.601
Stupid putz!

56:37.811 --> 56:40.771
Sounds like old Double Dork
is missing a step or two.

56:41.147 --> 56:43.607
-We recorded all this?
-lt's all on tape.

56:43.817 --> 56:45.901
Locked in the memory bank
in the belly.

56:46.152 --> 56:50.072
I think old Double Dork's
entitled to a quickie. Don't you?

56:50.281 --> 56:51.698
Absolutely.

56:52.075 --> 56:53.742
Can you erase that tape?

56:53.952 --> 56:56.370
The memory bank's locked,
but I can get in.

56:56.579 --> 56:57.955
Good.

57:03.128 --> 57:06.296
This mother hears through walls,
fires 4000 rounds a minute...

57:06.506 --> 57:09.425
...and peeks down dresses at
1 000 feet. Jesus Christ!

57:09.676 --> 57:14.054
This terminal here is hooked
into every data bank that there is.

57:14.264 --> 57:16.515
A dozen of these and you
could run the country.

57:16.724 --> 57:19.643
Watch this.
I feed it my name, right?

57:25.316 --> 57:27.776
They got your whole life in here.

57:28.445 --> 57:30.070
Hit mine.

57:31.322 --> 57:33.073
Murphy...

57:33.283 --> 57:35.325
...Frankie.

57:46.629 --> 57:48.589
File under repair?

57:49.132 --> 57:51.300
Did you break your file?
That's weird.

57:51.509 --> 57:53.302
Special Base to Blue Thunder.

57:53.553 --> 57:54.845
Blue Thunder.

57:55.096 --> 57:58.432
-lt's a wrap tonight. Come on home.
-1 0-4.

57:58.641 --> 58:00.726
Right, I'd better get going.

58:01.352 --> 58:03.645
You'd better go too, Mr. Fletcher.

58:04.647 --> 58:07.399
I'll come along there when he's in.

58:07.567 --> 58:09.151
Yeah, right.

58:18.536 --> 58:21.914
Blue Thunder, wind 270 degrees at 1 2.

58:22.165 --> 58:24.208
Blue Thunder to base,
final approach.

58:25.084 --> 58:29.046
Altimeter, two-niner-niner-five.
Cleared to land.

58:46.481 --> 58:48.774
Does Cochrane drive a gray Corvette?

58:48.942 --> 58:49.942
Yeah. Why?

58:50.193 --> 58:53.028
Check 9:00.
He's in some kind of hurry.

58:54.614 --> 58:55.906
Oh, yeah.

59:00.870 --> 59:02.538
Listen. Check Cochrane out.

59:02.789 --> 59:05.666
-On the computer?
-Yeah. I'm gonna tag along.

59:16.511 --> 59:18.136
Blue Thunder, this is Tower.

59:18.388 --> 59:20.305
Do you copy?
Is there a problem?

59:20.515 --> 59:23.725
That's Cochrane, F.E., U.S. Army.

59:23.977 --> 59:26.979
F.E. What's F.E. stand for?

59:27.188 --> 59:28.939
"Fuck Everybody."

59:29.190 --> 59:30.274
Gnarly!

59:32.360 --> 59:33.485
We're almost there.

59:34.612 --> 59:36.655
This is Tower. Do you copy?

59:37.115 --> 59:40.409
Base, you're coming in garbled.
Can't read you.

59:40.577 --> 59:41.577
I got Washington.

59:44.664 --> 59:45.747
Go for it.

59:46.457 --> 59:49.585
Cannot read you, Special Base.
Still garbled.

59:49.794 --> 59:52.087
Blue Thunder, come in.
Do you read me?

59:52.338 --> 59:56.049
Breaking up, Special Base.
Can't read you. Still garbled.

59:59.262 --> 01:00:00.554
Here it comes.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.480
"Project Thor." Wait.
Find out what that is.

01:00:10.732 --> 01:00:12.816
Request information:

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:17.779
Thor Project.

01:00:26.372 --> 01:00:28.415
I got it. Here it comes.

01:00:28.666 --> 01:00:33.378
"Tactical Helicopter
Offensive Response."

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:38.216
Offensive Response?

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:40.594
What does that mean?

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:44.890
Washington's jerking us around.
They've got bigger plans for this.

01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:52.522
-Blue Thunder, you will acknowledge.
-Oh, shit!

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:56.109
Blue Thunder to Special Base--

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.820
Oh, shit!

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:18.382
-He's going in there.
-Yeah.

01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:19.591
Where are we?

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:21.551
-Federal Building.
-Really?

01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:23.970
Wanna find out what's going on?

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.306
Certainly.
Here goes the whisper mode.

01:01:40.613 --> 01:01:41.613
You get anything?

01:01:42.073 --> 01:01:44.950
I just had a good shot of
some guys emptying trash.

01:01:45.159 --> 01:01:46.201
Can't use it.

01:01:46.452 --> 01:01:49.121
Goddamn it to hell!
What's going on out there?

01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:52.249
I'm holding you responsible
for that man's behavior.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.752
Dr. Haycock strongly recommended
he be grounded.

01:01:56.045 --> 01:01:58.046
For your information, Mr. lcelan...

01:01:58.256 --> 01:02:01.591
...there are no paranoid
schizophrenics on duty here.

01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:04.094
He checks his sanity with
his wristwatch!

01:02:04.303 --> 01:02:07.222
What do you check yours with?
A dipstick?

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.809
I don't have to take crap from you.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.227
He's finished as of now.

01:02:12.478 --> 01:02:15.230
If there's a scratch
on that aircraft, so are you.

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:17.691
All right, try the thermograph.

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:24.281
I told you it was cool.

01:02:24.782 --> 01:02:26.366
Lovely, lovely!

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.914
-Park here.
-l'll bring it around.

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:34.291
I got something!

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.133
-lt locked!
-Yeah. Hold it, hold it.

01:02:47.638 --> 01:02:49.181
l still fail to understand.

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:53.477
The Astro Division is autonomous.
The man was assigned to us.

01:02:53.686 --> 01:02:55.645
-McNeely complicated it.
-Fletcher!

01:02:55.897 --> 01:03:00.192
I can't say you people have
covered yourselves with glory so far.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:04.780
If she hadn't started shouting,
we wouldn't have had to rough her up.

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:06.531
Rough her up?

01:03:08.075 --> 01:03:10.410
Is that a euphemism
for "assassination"?

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.789
She had street informants,
and she'd made the connection...

01:03:13.998 --> 01:03:17.000
...between our project
and the trouble in the streets.

01:03:17.251 --> 01:03:19.628
She was going public, on the record.

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:21.546
Who are these other guys?

01:03:22.089 --> 01:03:23.965
-They can't hear me.
-Shut up anyway!

01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:27.594
-This pilot--
-Murphy. Frank Murphy.

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:30.639
ls that under control?
I don't want attention.

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:33.183
Blue Thunder might be perceived
as a threat.

01:03:33.434 --> 01:03:36.102
-Drop the hammer on him.
-What do you think?

01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:40.065
I think, Mr. Holmes,
that I should take him out.

01:03:40.274 --> 01:03:41.900
You mean kill him?

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:44.861
-When?
-As soon as possible.

01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:46.863
Jesus Christ, Frank!

01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:49.449
The boy loves me!
You got this on tape?

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:51.743
-l got every word of it.
-Good.

01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:53.995
Give him all the help he needs.

01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:56.206
This conversation never took place.

01:03:56.415 --> 01:03:58.250
If it gets back to me, I'll deny it.

01:04:03.548 --> 01:04:05.257
Oh, shit!

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:12.973
We're in deep shit!
Let's get the hell out!

01:04:28.614 --> 01:04:31.324
Tower, we have 330 degrees and 1 5.

01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:34.703
Altimeter still 3000.
Clear to land?

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:38.373
Air-1 2 traffic, 1 :00
two miles north-eastbound.

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:40.750
lt's a Cessna 1 82 at 5000 VFR.

01:04:41.002 --> 01:04:44.504
Blue Thunder down at 21 30.

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:48.216
Captain wants to see you
in the office right away.

01:04:49.343 --> 01:04:52.387
-l'll get the tape's keycard.
-Be careful.

01:04:57.768 --> 01:04:59.019
Yes, sir. I will.

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:02.814
Well, sir, he's--
He's not that--

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:06.151
Very well, sir.

01:05:06.694 --> 01:05:07.819
I will.

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:11.281
All right, sir. l will.

01:05:11.532 --> 01:05:13.033
Yes, thank you.

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:18.121
-Did you have a nice flight?
-l enjoyed it.

01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:20.707
I hope so. lt's
your last for a while.

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:23.293
-Now listen, Jack--
-No, you listen.

01:05:23.502 --> 01:05:24.961
That's how it is from now on:

01:05:25.212 --> 01:05:27.130
Me captain, you cop.
Me talk, you listen.

01:05:27.798 --> 01:05:30.675
If l don't have an ass
when l get out of this chair...

01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:33.094
...it's because
the old man chewed it off.

01:05:42.229 --> 01:05:46.191
You're beautiful when you're angry,
but let's talk privately.

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:49.110
We don't have any secrets
from Mr. Icelan.

01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:52.656
You're off the program, Frank.
You and your buddy Lymangood.

01:05:52.865 --> 01:05:55.367
I'll be lucky if I'm not
in Pacoima tomorrow...

01:05:55.576 --> 01:05:57.035
...driving a black-and-white.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:01.831
Captain Braddock speaking.

01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:03.959
Yes, sir.
He's here, colonel.

01:06:06.879 --> 01:06:07.879
Icelan.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.551
Guys, don't forget
to check under the hood.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.804
Just gonna get my cuff links.

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:30.360
Who are you conning
with that phony radio bullshit?

01:06:30.569 --> 01:06:34.698
For chrissakes, that went out 3 days
after Marconi invented it!

01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:41.663
Captain Braddock speaking.

01:06:44.041 --> 01:06:45.208
Yes, sir.

01:06:46.919 --> 01:06:48.628
Yes, sir.
It's taken care of.

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:08.690
Who unlocked the memory bank?

01:07:08.899 --> 01:07:10.734
That tall numb-nuts cop.

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.987
-Lymangood?
-You got it.

01:07:14.613 --> 01:07:15.613
Son of a bitch!

01:07:50.316 --> 01:07:51.775
Hey!

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:58.281
Get his gun!

01:08:09.293 --> 01:08:10.335
Take it easy.

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:13.630
Pay attention. Pay attention!

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:16.883
-We don't wanna hurt you.
-We want the tape.

01:08:17.801 --> 01:08:19.051
Let's be reasonable.

01:08:19.303 --> 01:08:21.720
You'll tell us what we wanna know
sooner or later.

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:24.432
And l think you'd rather it be sooner.

01:08:25.392 --> 01:08:29.062
Because first, we're gonna
break your fingers...

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:32.774
...then your arm,
then maybe your knees.

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:36.569
Now, l know you don't believe me...

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.738
...so l'm gonna show you.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.457
Now, can it be sooner?

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:53.127
The tape.

01:08:53.962 --> 01:08:55.546
It's in your car?

01:08:57.925 --> 01:08:59.300
Check the car.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:19.279
You wanna tell us where it is?

01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:28.287
You wanna write it down?
Thattaboy!

01:11:43.674 --> 01:11:46.801
All units, detain
and hold for questioning...

01:11:47.052 --> 01:11:48.428
...Officer Frank Murphy...

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:51.180
...in connection with the death
of Officer Lymangood.

01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:54.475
Possibly driving
a black '79 Trans Am...

01:11:54.685 --> 01:11:57.437
...California license,
909 King-Edward-Boy.

01:11:57.646 --> 01:12:00.106
I want to get a confirmation on that.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.191
This is Air-1 2 to Central.

01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:05.028
Can we get a confirmation
on that dispatch?

01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:09.741
Black '79 Trans Am. California
license 909 King-Edward-Boy.

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:13.244
Officer Frank Murphy.
Detain and hold for questioning...

01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:16.998
...in connection with the death
of Officer Richard Lymangood.

01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:41.606
So far, so good.

01:12:41.815 --> 01:12:45.777
Check out Big Brother's tape
in Blue Thunder to learn more.

01:12:47.905 --> 01:12:51.866
I just heard about Lymangood.
I'm really sorry.

01:12:52.117 --> 01:12:54.327
Call me if you want to talk.

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:37.537
-Here's your tea, colonel.
-Thank you.

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:39.914
Why don't we just blank the tape?

01:13:40.165 --> 01:13:42.917
That's what it's
designed for, right?

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:46.921
They tell me Lymangood changed
the code numbers.

01:13:47.172 --> 01:13:50.633
To go through every possible
combination would take forever.

01:13:55.013 --> 01:13:57.306
The trouble is,
we don't have forever.

01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:25.877
Hey, boss. How's it going?

01:14:26.086 --> 01:14:28.004
Listen, l got the tape...

01:14:29.006 --> 01:14:31.215
...but it's not safe
to take it home.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:34.969
So I'm gonna--
There's this drive-in that I go to...

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:38.222
...at Riverside and Victory,
on the corner.

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:41.767
There's a dumpster in the back,
behind the concession stand.

01:14:42.019 --> 01:14:45.271
And I'm pretty sure
they don't empty it until Monday.

01:14:45.522 --> 01:14:48.608
So that's where I'm gonna
stash the tape, okay?

01:14:49.526 --> 01:14:54.030
This is getting kind of fun, huh?
Cops and robbers, for real!

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:55.907
Well....

01:14:56.533 --> 01:14:59.368
Good luck if you should decide
to accept this mission.

01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:01.954
This is Lymangood.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.751
I forgot to tell you.
l found out what "JAFO" is:

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:10.505
"Just Another Fucking Observer."

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:16.552
You're not supposed to be in there.
Get the fuck out!

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:22.016
You talking to me, asshole?

01:15:58.011 --> 01:15:59.262
Damn. Murphy!

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.611
This is Special Base.
Come in.

01:16:22.035 --> 01:16:23.077
Shit!

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:27.456
Los Angeles mobile.

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:29.875
Mobile, listen. Get me KBLA-TV.

01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:32.086
That number's in your directory.

01:16:32.337 --> 01:16:35.172
Don't give me static.
This is a police emergency.

01:16:35.382 --> 01:16:36.507
Get me KBLA now!

01:16:38.552 --> 01:16:40.845
Good afternoon, KBLA-TV.

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:43.931
I want to speak to Mario Machado
or Alf Hewitt.

01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:46.934
They're out in the field.
Wanna leave a message?

01:16:47.144 --> 01:16:49.562
Tell them
Officer Frank Murphy is calling.

01:16:49.813 --> 01:16:52.273
I'm sending them a package.
Do you read me?

01:16:52.482 --> 01:16:53.983
That's Frank Astro?

01:16:54.234 --> 01:16:56.861
No, Frank Murphy. Astro Division...

01:16:57.112 --> 01:16:59.572
...police emergency.
Got it, sweetheart?

01:17:00.073 --> 01:17:03.284
-Yeah, I got it.
-Okay. Mobile? Mobile?

01:17:03.493 --> 01:17:06.329
-Los Angeles mobile.
-Listen, I need another number.

01:17:10.042 --> 01:17:12.293
-Hello?
-Kate, it's Frank.

01:17:12.502 --> 01:17:14.503
Where are you?
I've been worried sick.

01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:17.965
I'm okay. Do me a favor
and pick up a package for me.

01:17:18.216 --> 01:17:21.469
It's in a drive-in at the corner
of Victory and Riverside.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.388
lt's near the concession stand,
in a dumpster.

01:17:24.598 --> 01:17:27.350
-And then what?
-Take it to KBLA-TV.

01:17:27.517 --> 01:17:29.477
To Mario Machado or Alf Hewitt.

01:17:29.686 --> 01:17:32.730
-Don't stop for anything or anybody.
-Got it.

01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:35.066
-Okay. Thank you, baby.
-Bye.

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:44.158
Where is he now?

01:17:44.368 --> 01:17:47.161
Over the Hollywood
and Ventura Freeway interchange.

01:17:47.621 --> 01:17:50.247
Get the mayor's office on the phone.

01:17:50.457 --> 01:17:52.792
We're gonna get the Air Force,
and now!

01:17:53.043 --> 01:17:57.755
He called Channel 8 first.
The second call was to his girlfriend.

01:17:57.964 --> 01:18:02.385
Forget about the police. Get our own
cars to her place and that TV station!

01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:04.637
The bastard wants to go public!

01:18:04.888 --> 01:18:06.972
-We'll stop that.
-We'd better!

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:31.140
Come on, move out!

01:19:33.643 --> 01:19:34.769
Move, move!

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:31.951
-Damn it, l can't see nothing!
-There she goes!

01:21:38.476 --> 01:21:44.315
Air-7 to Special One.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.904
No shit, pendejo!

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:51.947
Set that thing down, man.

01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:54.867
We got two choppers full
of SWAT guys.

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:01.415
It's getting real cozy up here.

01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:04.209
Return to base
or we're gonna open fire.

01:22:08.298 --> 01:22:10.215
Come on, will you, Murphy?

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:14.845
All right, knock him down.

01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:23.270
Okay, amigo, how's
your auto-rotation technique?

01:22:27.525 --> 01:22:28.525
Son of a bitch!

01:22:41.331 --> 01:22:42.498
Damn it! Hang on!

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:48.003
Sorry about that, my friend.

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:00.975
Not again!

01:23:01.184 --> 01:23:04.520
All right, chaps.
How'd you like to follow my leader?

01:24:33.651 --> 01:24:34.902
-Pull up now!
-Pull up!

01:25:23.076 --> 01:25:25.035
Okay, lady! Pull over!

01:25:36.422 --> 01:25:37.840
Is there a problem, officer?

01:25:38.091 --> 01:25:39.925
A den mother in a Vega, right?

01:25:40.176 --> 01:25:44.471
Now play it very cool. l need
your license and your registration.

01:25:44.681 --> 01:25:45.681
Sure.

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:54.314
-l think l left them--
-Get out of the car.

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:08.055
Channel 8 is bringing you live
coverage of a helicopter hijacking.

01:27:08.431 --> 01:27:12.392
Stay inside your homes.
There's a sniper over Los Angeles.

01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:15.771
We've already lost one police car
and two helicopters.

01:27:16.022 --> 01:27:18.023
Well, what now, gentlemen?

01:27:18.274 --> 01:27:20.484
I don't plan on losing
more helicopters.

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:23.153
May I introduce Colonel Coe
of the Air Force?

01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:24.488
-Colonel.
Mr. Mayor.

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:27.241
A couple of F-1 6s are standing by
at March Field.

01:27:27.492 --> 01:27:29.368
-F-1 6s?
-We can take him out now.

01:27:29.827 --> 01:27:34.331
-All you've got to do is say the word.
-The F-1 6 is armed with rockets.

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:37.751
The potential destruction
of innocent life is unimaginable.

01:27:38.002 --> 01:27:40.587
The F-1 6 is armed
with heat-seeking missiles.

01:27:40.838 --> 01:27:43.215
We can surgically remove him.
Like a tumor.

01:27:43.466 --> 01:27:45.384
We're not talking about a tumor.

01:27:52.976 --> 01:27:54.977
You gotta make a right there!

01:27:59.232 --> 01:28:01.024
No, Kate.

01:28:16.207 --> 01:28:18.542
You're really riding with the angels,
sweetheart.

01:28:47.405 --> 01:28:49.698
Thattagirl.
Good work!

01:29:05.131 --> 01:29:10.135
Ray lcelan at Astro says they've
scrambled two F-1 6s out of March.

01:29:10.386 --> 01:29:12.846
-What about the tape?
-No sign of it.

01:29:13.097 --> 01:29:16.308
But he called KBLA.
Fletcher's there to intercept.

01:29:16.559 --> 01:29:18.810
I'll take care
of you one at a time.

01:29:19.062 --> 01:29:22.230
We'll have more help down here.
Just be calm.

01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:27.277
Sir! Sir! l've got to give this tape
to Mr. Machado or Abe Hewitt.

01:29:27.528 --> 01:29:31.239
-They're very busy right now.
-Yes, but this is from Frank Murphy.

01:29:31.491 --> 01:29:35.619
There's a crazy man in a helicopter.
I'll tell somebody you're here.

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:38.705
The most dangerous thing
is a man afraid for his job.

01:29:38.956 --> 01:29:42.459
I'm Dick Fisher.
I'll get that to Mario if you'd like.

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:45.170
No, I have to give this to
Mr. Mocher or--

01:29:45.421 --> 01:29:46.671
Machado.

01:29:46.923 --> 01:29:50.384
I'm his producer. l'd be delighted
to bring it up to him.

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:52.135
I don't think so.

01:29:52.387 --> 01:29:55.097
Can't we erase it?
Isn't that what the bug's for?

01:29:55.348 --> 01:29:57.391
We don't know the code number.

01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:00.602
Then erase them all.

01:30:00.812 --> 01:30:05.440
-Why don't you give it to me--?
-Frank said to give it to Mr. Hewitt--

01:30:05.691 --> 01:30:09.277
I'm Alf Hewitt. You're the lady
with the tape from Frank Murphy?

01:30:09.529 --> 01:30:11.279
Your producer said that Mr.--

01:30:11.531 --> 01:30:15.742
Who? I never saw this guy before
in my life. Come on, let's go.

01:30:15.993 --> 01:30:18.328
Not so fast.
That's government property.

01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:21.248
-Get your hands off me!
-Stop him!

01:30:22.291 --> 01:30:24.292
Get this bastard off me!

01:30:25.461 --> 01:30:27.546
Son of a bitch!
I'll blow your head off!

01:30:29.507 --> 01:30:31.716
Go, go, go! l got the tape!

01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:01.538
March Control,
this is Little Brother One.

01:31:01.789 --> 01:31:06.168
We have your target bearing 1 21
at 1 3 miles.

01:31:06.419 --> 01:31:08.462
Request clearance to engage.
Over.

01:31:09.839 --> 01:31:12.799
Roger, Little Brother.
This is March Control.

01:31:13.050 --> 01:31:15.343
Affirmative.
Engage and destroy.

01:31:15.928 --> 01:31:18.221
I repeat:
Engage and destroy.

01:31:30.359 --> 01:31:32.986
There he is.
He's all yours, cookie.

01:32:35.967 --> 01:32:37.676
Holy shit!

01:32:50.898 --> 01:32:51.982
What?

01:32:54.110 --> 01:32:55.527
Well, l'll be damned.

01:32:56.862 --> 01:33:01.199
One of your missiles just took out
a barbeque shack down in Little Tokyo.

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:04.786
-Francis, isn't that Ray's district?
-Yes, it is.

01:33:05.037 --> 01:33:06.204
You have his number?

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:09.541
Call him, or they'll call him
and he'll call us....

01:33:09.792 --> 01:33:11.418
I'm on my way!

01:33:51.208 --> 01:33:53.126
There he is, right there!

01:33:56.714 --> 01:33:58.757
All right, everybody,
this is an emergency!

01:33:59.008 --> 01:34:01.801
-All right, clear the area.
-Clear the area!

01:34:08.017 --> 01:34:09.601
Well, what do you know!

01:34:10.102 --> 01:34:11.311
He froze.

01:34:12.605 --> 01:34:15.315
Okay, he's all mine now, Cookie.

01:34:45.221 --> 01:34:46.763
Oh, my God!

01:35:10.705 --> 01:35:12.372
l'm hit, cookie!
I'm hit!

01:35:12.623 --> 01:35:14.207
He blew my goddamn wing off!

01:35:14.875 --> 01:35:16.126
Mayday! Mayday!

01:35:16.377 --> 01:35:19.170
This is Little Brother One.
I'm ejecting!

01:35:55.916 --> 01:35:59.627
We just lost an F-1 6 and the top
of the Arco Tower. Now what?

01:35:59.879 --> 01:36:01.671
That's it. Call it off.

01:36:01.881 --> 01:36:06.176
May I remind you there is a crazy man
up there with six 20 mm cannons?

01:36:06.385 --> 01:36:07.677
I said, call it off.

01:36:08.345 --> 01:36:10.388
Request permission for takeoff.

01:36:10.639 --> 01:36:13.808
Colonel, hold your position.
Operation canceled.

01:36:14.101 --> 01:36:17.937
Repeat: Hold your position.
Do not take off.

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:54.200
Back to base.

01:38:06.171 --> 01:38:09.674
Rough her up? Is that a
euphemism for "assassination"?

01:38:09.925 --> 01:38:15.054
She had street informants, and she'd
connected our project to the trouble--

01:38:15.389 --> 01:38:17.473
Jesus, Lollie,
you ought to hear this stuff.

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:19.767
They sound like cops and feds.

01:38:20.019 --> 01:38:24.105
They're stirring up the barrio
to prove what that chopper can do.

01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:28.192
Tell Mario to go easy
on that "mad-sniper" stuff.

01:38:28.402 --> 01:38:31.863
That cop may be the hottest
ticket since Horatius at the bridge.

01:39:42.017 --> 01:39:43.810
All right, let's try this.

01:40:40.617 --> 01:40:42.493
All right, where are you?

01:41:17.571 --> 01:41:19.155
Oh, damn it!

01:42:02.032 --> 01:42:06.327
All right, Murphy. It's about time you
put your money where your mouth is.

01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:18.131
One, two...

01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:19.382
...three!

01:42:35.774 --> 01:42:38.151
Come on, you tub of shit!

01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:50.621
That's impossible!

01:43:08.348 --> 01:43:09.348
Catch you later.

01:44:01.151 --> 01:44:04.654
Okay. And now it's your turn.

01:44:58.375 --> 01:45:03.504
The $5 million prototype was destroyed
when Officer Murphy, out of gas...

01:45:03.839 --> 01:45:08.426
...set the helicopter down on the
tracks in front of a freight train.

01:45:08.677 --> 01:45:11.971
That was the end of the helicopter,
but not of this story.

01:45:12.222 --> 01:45:16.225
On the strength of a tape that
Murphy delivered to this reporter...

01:45:16.476 --> 01:45:21.147
...the mayor's reopened the
investigation of McNeely's death...

01:45:21.398 --> 01:45:26.402
...which might also be connected
with the death of Officer Lymangood.

01:45:26.653 --> 01:45:29.030
Half a dozen local police officers...

01:45:29.239 --> 01:45:33.117
...and several officials of the
State and Justice departments...

01:45:33.368 --> 01:45:35.286
...have been detained for questioning.

01:45:35.495 --> 01:45:36.787
Coming up, weather...

01:45:37.039 --> 01:45:40.916
...and a preview of a bullet train
soon to be seen in the Southland.

01:45:41.126 --> 01:45:42.293
Maybe.
