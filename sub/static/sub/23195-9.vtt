00:39.935 --> 00:49.456
Subtitles by MisterMascolo

00:49.456 --> 00:51.074
It's time we hear again

00:51.074 --> 00:56.980
when legends are ripped, screaming and bloody

00:56.980 --> 00:59.392
from the wumb of glory

00:59.392 --> 01:01.714
That's just one of the many disgusting ways

01:01.714 --> 01:04.965
we'll be describing the white knuckle action of vghs'

01:04.965 --> 01:07.557
fps clan tryouts

01:07.557 --> 01:11.017
Live here in our mobile studio in grand theft auditorium

01:11.017 --> 01:12.450
and speaking of legens

01:12.450 --> 01:17.117
our special guest of today eats legends for brunch

01:17.224 --> 01:18.611
hey law

01:18.611 --> 01:19.571
hope you grabbed a snack for the match

01:19.571 --> 01:21.049
ehm, I did Scott, thank you

01:24.296 --> 01:26.226
so law, we've got 84 students

01:26.226 --> 01:29.440
going for just 12 Jv and Varsity jants

01:29.440 --> 01:31.986
any pro tips for your fellow mouse jockeys?

01:31.986 --> 01:34.131
before they get ready for the death?

01:34.131 --> 01:36.452
well, i don't know about pro tips, but

01:36.452 --> 01:43.497
let me tell you something i once told a promising young newblade

01:43.497 --> 01:47.605
VGHS is about being the best

01:47.605 --> 01:49.066
but you can't be the best

01:49.066 --> 01:51.236
you must be yourself

01:51.236 --> 01:55.190
so before you walk in the tryouts today

01:55.190 --> 01:59.684
i want you to dig deep before you walk through these doors

01:59.684 --> 02:04.267
i want you to find out what drives you

02:04.267 --> 02:06.220
cause once you find that out

02:06.220 --> 02:10.163
once you know what it is to truly game

02:10.163 --> 02:14.842
then nobody can break you

02:17.080 --> 02:20.572
you guys are ready to go?

02:20.572 --> 02:23.238
chiba, honzo!

02:23.238 --> 02:24.171
how did you

02:24.171 --> 02:25.497
Fished them out of the dumpster

02:25.497 --> 02:27.950
You didn't think i'd let you actually throw your gear, did you?

02:27.950 --> 02:29.750
i fixed them for you, they should be fully functional

02:29.750 --> 02:31.923
and i've added a few...

02:31.923 --> 02:34.243
upgrades

02:34.243 --> 02:37.928
you guys know you're the best friends ever, right?

02:37.928 --> 02:39.094
we are?

02:39.094 --> 02:42.066
of course we are!

02:42.066 --> 02:46.058
now let's go playing some video games

02:58.500 --> 03:04.301
now we've seen some great action today, but this final match is the one that everyone is gabbing about

03:04.301 --> 03:06.356
in the red corner: the leanest, the meanest

03:06.356 --> 03:09.902
fps-est varsity crew this school has ever seen

03:09.902 --> 03:11.948
they must have a pretty good captain

03:11.948 --> 03:13.614
and in the blue corner

03:13.614 --> 03:16.675
a rad tad group led by jenny Matrix

03:16.675 --> 03:20.861
who's fighting to be the first softmore ever to make it onto the vghs

03:20.861 --> 03:22.526
varsity team

03:22.526 --> 03:25.896
doesn't help that she's down a man due to Brian D's expulsion

03:25.896 --> 03:27.743
Yes, we've got you to thank for that, Law

03:27.743 --> 03:30.183
Look, when a troublemaker like Brian comes into a school

03:30.183 --> 03:33.412
STFU Law, It's Brian D!

03:37.949 --> 03:38.704
Noo!

03:38.704 --> 03:40.514
No!

03:40.514 --> 03:43.779
Don't you understand the maning of the world  "expelled", D?

03:43.779 --> 03:45.541
i signed up, i'm still in the system

03:45.541 --> 03:47.523
the rules say i can play

03:47.523 --> 03:49.698
Pff, Who sold you that load of molineux?

03:49.698 --> 03:53.599
Around here I'm the dungeon keeper, and my rules are in black and white

03:53.599 --> 03:55.207
looks like your fable ends here

03:55.207 --> 03:56.723
i know it does

03:56.723 --> 03:59.697
it was my dream to play on a vghs team and i screwed it up

03:59.697 --> 04:02.379
yes, you messed it up bad! Like a failure

04:03.519 --> 04:05.311
so what are you doing on my battlefield?

04:05.311 --> 04:07.301
This isn't about you and me

04:07.301 --> 04:08.711
it's not about getting back in

04:08.711 --> 04:14.556
it's about one last chance to play with the best of the best

04:14.556 --> 04:17.654
it's about playing the game

04:17.654 --> 04:21.149
so at the end of the day Calhoun

04:21.149 --> 04:26.076
it's all about the game

04:26.076 --> 04:34.534
GG Brian D

04:34.534 --> 04:36.436
he plays!

04:36.436 --> 04:38.451
I can't believe that worked

04:38.451 --> 04:41.593
check out brian d's old school gear!

04:41.593 --> 04:44.234
Don't tell me he's that one he smoke you with

04:44.234 --> 04:46.079
Law-lipop

04:46.079 --> 04:50.866
alright everybody calm down, the game is about to start

04:54.092 --> 04:55.836
You've shown up late again, uh brian?

04:55.836 --> 04:58.183
you never seem to learn, do you?

04:58.183 --> 05:00.305
Rule No 1 Ace

05:00.305 --> 05:02.440
never give up

05:02.440 --> 05:04.946
Rule No 271 Never quote my rules back to me

05:04.946 --> 05:14.093
Now sit your punk ass down and best wishes

05:17.313 --> 05:22.333
you all know the routine, you keep it clean up there

05:22.333 --> 05:23.921
match begins in thirty seconds

05:23.921 --> 05:27.561

05:27.561 --> 05:28.765
COUNTDOWN

05:28.765 --> 05:31.924
allright bring it in

05:31.924 --> 05:34.251

05:34.251 --> 05:37.280
yeah you're expelled, you've no chance of making jv

05:37.280 --> 05:39.796
hey| i've seen these two cats meow

05:39.796 --> 05:42.052
and it's about to be a fancy fist tonight

05:42.052 --> 05:43.294
you plan on bringing the thunder?

05:43.294 --> 05:44.093
you know it

05:44.093 --> 05:45.765
good enough for me

05:45.765 --> 05:46.936
Jenny

05:46.936 --> 05:49.402
Now that you've all worked out your feelings

05:49.402 --> 05:51.557
are you ready to kick some ass?

07:06.229 --> 07:08.729
Fry my circuits! D and Jenny've just grabbed the case

07:08.729 --> 07:12.804
bust out your butts and putt butt bibbs on these butts zoners

07:12.804 --> 07:15.734
because this combo is bubble

07:15.734 --> 07:18.988
please, grabbing the case is the easy part

07:18.988 --> 07:21.984
let's see how these butts do on the long way back

07:31.246 --> 07:34.259
How crowdass that kid can play

07:34.259 --> 07:36.167
i hate that kid

07:54.813 --> 07:57.655
Bullim! Underclassmen draw first blood!

07:57.655 --> 08:03.901
Law, looks like your ex girlfriend and arch rival are really kicking your team's ass

08:34.255 --> 08:36.077
Jenny matrix has almost dome

08:36.077 --> 08:41.126
these underclassmen are one point away from the biggest upset in clan tryout's history

08:41.126 --> 08:42.807
and that's not all, shotbot

08:42.807 --> 08:48.404
another round like that and brian d could actually get back in, into vghs

08:48.404 --> 08:52.495
Now how's that do ya, Law

08:52.495 --> 08:54.377
he's gone

08:54.377 --> 08:58.427

09:05.485 --> 09:06.293

09:06.293 --> 09:08.512
THE LAW HAS ENTERED THE GAME

09:08.512 --> 09:09.902
The law?

09:09.902 --> 09:11.026
Game over man

09:12.779 --> 09:14.055

09:15.947 --> 09:19.020
HEADSHOT

09:19.020 --> 09:20.558
Law ready for this?

09:20.558 --> 09:23.225
Run!

10:05.310 --> 10:09.502
Yowza! lesson learned, hell hath no
fury like a Law scorned!

10:27.644 --> 10:28.805
I know me some ownage

10:28.805 --> 10:32.113

10:33.653 --> 10:36.439

10:37.265 --> 10:38.997

10:38.997 --> 10:40.823
It's time for a sudden death!

10:40.823 --> 10:44.329
3 minutes, no respawns, no mercy

10:44.329 --> 10:48.182
Ladies and gentelman, it does not get better than this

10:48.182 --> 10:53.040
two stories, one villan of Quakesperian proportions

10:53.040 --> 10:55.983
and it all comes down to this final play

10:55.983 --> 10:59.455
Jenny, Brian

10:59.455 --> 11:02.147
make it a good one

11:02.147 --> 11:03.426
everybody stop!

11:03.426 --> 11:05.089
we can still win this thing

11:05.089 --> 11:07.120
get real Matrix, we're down-zo

11:07.120 --> 11:08.478
the law is coming

11:08.478 --> 11:10.151
for me

11:10.151 --> 11:13.165
The law is here because i'm here

11:13.165 --> 11:15.495
So i say let him have me

11:15.495 --> 11:18.108
you know you're almost in school, right?

11:18.108 --> 11:20.706
i know

11:20.706 --> 11:24.300
alright, here's the plan

11:46.682 --> 11:48.771
LAW!

11:52.611 --> 11:54.534
he's mine

12:09.369 --> 12:10.356
Jenny

12:10.356 --> 12:11.792
Law

12:11.792 --> 12:13.802
awkward

12:13.802 --> 12:15.167
so

12:15.167 --> 12:17.676
what's happening captain?

12:17.676 --> 12:19.017
Should we just shoot each other?

12:19.017 --> 12:21.295
oh we could

12:21.295 --> 12:26.826
but that won't get you on varsity know, would it?

12:26.826 --> 12:29.291
here's how this is gonna work

12:29.291 --> 12:31.972
you're gonna go grab the intel

12:31.972 --> 12:35.226
i'm going to say hi to Brian

12:35.226 --> 12:40.180
and I'll see you at Varsity practice tomorrow

12:40.180 --> 12:42.429
you think i'd be caught dead on your team

12:42.429 --> 12:48.266
Matrix, please

12:48.266 --> 12:53.079
i should go before people start talking

13:03.913 --> 13:04.623
Hey brian

13:04.623 --> 13:05.514
Argh

13:05.514 --> 13:06.702
Argh!

13:06.702 --> 13:09.151
Jenny just shot me in the back

13:09.151 --> 13:10.715
Oh wait no

13:10.715 --> 13:11.698
I'm sorry

13:11.698 --> 13:13.439

13:18.038 --> 13:21.502
Really, Brian?

13:28.917 --> 13:33.988
really?

13:33.988 --> 13:38.512
I gotta admire your gumption, kid

13:38.512 --> 13:42.459
you really want to play this game one last time

13:42.459 --> 13:44.171
Okay

13:44.171 --> 13:45.837
The clock's ticking

13:45.837 --> 13:47.929
so why don't you put that 'nade on your nogging

13:47.929 --> 13:54.217
and we'll put this all "is anybody better than the Law" issue to bed

14:04.529 --> 14:06.302
Brian

14:06.302 --> 14:08.732
move the face

14:08.732 --> 14:15.990
I'm not the bad guy here, you were nothing and nobody

14:15.990 --> 14:23.302
and then you met me and the whole world gave you a shot

14:23.302 --> 14:26.311
and you blew it

14:26.311 --> 14:29.468
you proved you're a nothing

14:29.468 --> 14:31.048
but surprise

14:31.048 --> 14:33.776
here's your pal The Law

14:33.776 --> 14:40.238
coming here to give you a last chance

14:40.238 --> 14:45.229
so are you gonna take it? Come on

14:45.229 --> 14:48.061
you've got nothing to lose

14:50.788 --> 14:52.741
almost

16:17.775 --> 16:19.882
Law ready for THAT?

16:27.636 --> 16:30.365
Brian D

16:30.365 --> 16:31.937
congratulations

16:31.937 --> 16:36.308

Welcome to the team

17:06.928 --> 17:09.685

17:09.685 --> 17:11.877
I'm sorry about Varsity

17:11.877 --> 17:13.652

17:13.652 --> 17:16.496
I'm happy with what i've got

17:27.192 --> 17:31.246
Sorry, i was completely unprofessional

17:31.246 --> 17:33.448
It's ok

17:33.448 --> 17:36.245
I am your captain now, though

17:36.245 --> 17:40.040
Oh, well it won't happen again

17:40.040 --> 17:42.507

17:45.532 --> 17:48.972
That was your first kiss, wasn't it?

17:48.972 --> 17:50.786
And my last, cause now i'm going to die

Thanks guy

19:30.694 --> 19:31.902
Wow, you've made your teams!

19:31.902 --> 19:33.787
Yes, she melted my old man's face off

19:33.787 --> 19:34.734
litterally

19:34.734 --> 19:36.412
oh no, not litterally

19:36.412 --> 19:39.282

19:39.282 --> 19:41.274
Put your jacket on, let's get some victory pizzas!

19:41.274 --> 19:45.274
pizza sounds great right about now
