00:35.369 --> 00:37.405
Where do you think you're going?

00:37.496 --> 00:39.953
- Out.
- With who?

00:40.958 --> 00:43.700
- Him?
- Yes, and you can't stop me.

- He's twice your age, Emily.
- So what, Mom?

00:48.299 --> 00:51.962
- Are you jealous?
- Emily, wait a minute!

00:52.053 --> 00:55.545
Emily! Listen to me. Emily!

00:56.432 --> 01:00.425
- Get back here, young lady, right now!
- You can't stop me! I love him!

01:14.992 --> 01:16.948
Can you hear me?

01:17.036 --> 01:19.527
[not muted] That's good.
Try and stay awake now.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.323
Outta the way, people!

01:23.417 --> 01:25.999
- She's bleeding.
- I'm pregnant.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.749
- What? What did you say?
- I'm pregnant.

01:28.839 --> 01:30.750

01:45.773 --> 01:47.604
OK, sweetheart. All right.

01:47.692 --> 01:48.977
There you go.

01:49.986 --> 01:51.817
Wrap you up nice and warm.

01:51.904 --> 01:53.860
We'll just take you over here now.

01:54.573 --> 01:57.189
Margaret, would you put him in
for me, please?

01:58.327 --> 01:59.703
My baby.

02:01.622 --> 02:02.611
It's a boy, honey.

02:04.041 --> 02:07.249
He's OK for now. He's just real early.

02:09.046 --> 02:11.378
- Can I hold him?
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.047
He's just too little.
We have to take him away now.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.126
But...

02:20.391 --> 02:22.347
Name... Name him John.

02:23.019 --> 02:26.887
Please. His name is John.

Who builds a cabin in the middle
of the jungle anyway?

02:34.238 --> 02:36.069
That's a good question.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.325
So how about answering it?

02:39.618 --> 02:41.028
I don't know.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.236
Then why are we even going there?

02:44.332 --> 02:46.948
Because hopefully the man
who lives in the cabin

02:47.043 --> 02:50.160
can tell us what to do about
the people trying to kill us.

02:50.254 --> 02:53.166
We've been walking all day.
Are we gonna get there soon?

02:54.925 --> 02:58.292
- How long?
- I don't know.

02:59.055 --> 03:01.842
- I've been following him.
- What?

03:01.932 --> 03:04.969
- What do you mean following him?
- I'm not even in front.

03:05.061 --> 03:07.973
- Hugo's the last one that saw it.
- This is just awesome.

03:08.064 --> 03:10.271
What do you think we should do, John?

03:12.318 --> 03:13.774
We're making camp.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.690
What? Here in the dark

03:17.782 --> 03:20.819
with the monster and... him?

03:20.910 --> 03:22.491
A little rest will do us good.

03:22.578 --> 03:25.820

freighter guys come back?

All right, get him on the litter.

03:59.782 --> 04:00.897
Careful with him!

04:00.991 --> 04:03.073
Get him down over there.

Careful.

OK, guys, unload it.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.163
Come on, pick it up, let's go.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.912
What did this to him?

04:12.795 --> 04:16.754
A black pillar of smoke
threw him 50 feet in the air

04:16.841 --> 04:18.377
and ripped his guts out.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.758
What?

04:21.303 --> 04:24.636
I need you to tell me exactly
how many people are on that island,

04:24.723 --> 04:26.634
where every one of them is.

04:26.725 --> 04:29.558
And why would I do that?

04:30.521 --> 04:33.854
Keamy! What the hell do you think
you're doing, mate?

04:34.608 --> 04:35.597
You gave me up.

04:36.861 --> 04:39.773
- What?
- Linus knew who I was, my name.

04:39.864 --> 04:42.105
He knew everything about me.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.986
No. I'm not the one who gave you up.

- Who?

Did you give him my name?

05:28.996 --> 05:30.327
Yeah.

Martin, we need him. He's the only one
who can fix the engines.

05:50.059 --> 05:54.428
- What makes you so sure about that?
- Because he's the one who broke them.

What are you doing out here?

07:19.607 --> 07:23.020
Building a place. A little getaway
for me and the missus.

07:24.528 --> 07:27.611
I mean, sometimes you need a break
from the DI, you know?

The Dharma Initiative?

07:31.035 --> 07:35.369

I'm not making any sense, am |?

07:37.041 --> 07:38.281
No.

07:42.379 --> 07:45.542
That's probably because
I've been dead for 12 years.

08:00.564 --> 08:01.974
Hello there.

08:13.869 --> 08:17.157
You gotta find me, John.
You gotta find me.

- Who?
- Jacob.

He's been waiting for you
a real long time, man.

I'm Horace.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.312
Godspeed, John.

08:59.123 --> 09:00.704
- Hugo.
- Mallomars.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.156
Wake up, Hugo.

09:02.251 --> 09:04.913
Hmm? Huh? Wha...?

09:05.003 --> 09:07.460
Time to get up. We're gonna get going.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.254
I thought we didn't know where.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.956
We do now.

[woman speaking indistinctly over PA]

Hi, Emily, Mrs. Locke.
It's good to see you.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.410
- How is he?
- He's amazing.

09:40.497 --> 09:44.115
He's the youngest preemie
to ever survive in this hospital.

09:44.209 --> 09:47.451
He's had infections, pneumonia,
you name it.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.252
Every time he knocked them out.

09:49.339 --> 09:52.297
He is a fighter, your little John.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.591
That's wonderful.

09:54.678 --> 09:57.340
The other girls say he's a miracle baby.

09:57.431 --> 10:00.264
And today, we're gonna take him
out of the incubator

10:00.350 --> 10:02.762
so you can hold him
for the very first time.

10:13.530 --> 10:16.522
I... I can't do this.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.402
[crying] Ijust know that I can't!

10:30.589 --> 10:32.921
So who do I talk to about adoption?

10:33.008 --> 10:35.420
You can't smoke in here, Mrs. Locke.

10:39.014 --> 10:41.221
Oh. Of course.

10:42.351 --> 10:43.716
I'm sorry.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.058
Is that the father?

10:50.901 --> 10:53.813
I... I don't know who that is.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.622
Can I ask you something?

11:08.418 --> 11:09.407
Sure.

11:10.295 --> 11:12.411
Why am I here, man?

11:13.090 --> 11:16.298
You're here because
you can see the cabin,

11:16.385 --> 11:18.501
and that makes you special.

11:18.595 --> 11:22.679
Well, I have a theory as to why
we're the only ones who can see it.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.051
I'd love to hear it.

11:24.142 --> 11:27.509
I think we can see it
'cause we're the craziest.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.852
So, how'd you figure out
where it was, dude?

11:32.943 --> 11:34.228
I didn't.

11:34.319 --> 11:37.903
We're not going to the cabin.
We're gonna make a pit stop first.

11:37.990 --> 11:40.197
Pit stop? Where?

11:41.743 --> 11:44.450
Ever wonder what happened
to the Dharma Initiative?

11:46.540 --> 11:50.453
There must have been at least
a hundred of 'em living on this island.

11:50.544 --> 11:53.126
Manning the stations,
building those homes,

11:53.213 --> 11:56.205
making all that ranch dressing
that you like.

11:56.300 --> 11:59.667
And then one day they're all gone,
they just disappeared.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.466
You want to know where we're going?

12:10.355 --> 12:12.016
We're going to see them.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.569
Whoa.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.489
What happened to 'em?

12:27.372 --> 12:28.828
He did.

12:31.793 --> 12:34.170
[rain falling]

12:40.010 --> 12:41.125
[woman] Hello.

12:41.219 --> 12:45.258
- That game's stupid.
- [woman] Right in here. Come on in.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.716
Melissa, stop that!

12:48.810 --> 12:52.803
Come on, take your brother in
the kitchen. Someone wants to see John.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.598
It is coming down like cats and dogs.

12:57.527 --> 13:00.269
This nice gentleman
wants to talk to you, John,

13:00.364 --> 13:03.197
so I want you on your best behavior,
understand?

13:06.036 --> 13:07.367
He's all yours.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.956
You like backgammon?

13:14.711 --> 13:17.293
You seem to have a pretty good
sense of the game.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.498
I'm Richard, John.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.753
I run a school for kids

13:25.847 --> 13:29.305
who are extremely special.

13:29.393 --> 13:32.851
And I have reason to believe
that you might be one of them.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.104
Mind if I show you
a couple of really neat things?

13:45.075 --> 13:47.737
[distant thunderclap]

13:51.915 --> 13:53.576
Did you draw that, John?

14:07.055 --> 14:09.922
I want you to look at these things...

14:14.229 --> 14:16.015
...and think about them.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.624
OK, now, tell me, John,

14:38.712 --> 14:41.704
which of these things belong to you?

14:44.968 --> 14:47.960
- To keep?
- No, no, John.

14:48.805 --> 14:52.389
Which of these things
belong to you already?

15:57.666 --> 16:01.250
Are you sure the knife belongs to you,
John? You sure about that?

16:07.217 --> 16:08.206
Well, it doesn't.

16:17.727 --> 16:19.058
How did he do?

16:19.146 --> 16:21.728
I'm afraid John isn't quite ready
for our school.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.521
I'm sorry I've wasted your time.

16:29.573 --> 16:30.813
What did you do?

16:41.042 --> 16:42.623
What's he doing down there?

16:48.842 --> 16:52.926
So... this is where you shot Locke
and left him for dead?

16:53.847 --> 16:56.839
Yes, Hugo, lwas standing
right where you are now

16:56.933 --> 16:58.764
when I pulled the trigger.

17:02.898 --> 17:05.856
I should've realized at the time
it was pointless.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.399
But I really wasn't thinking clearly.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.863
Is that why you killed
all these people too?

17:13.950 --> 17:15.360
I didn't kill them.

17:15.452 --> 17:18.364
If the Others didn't wipe out
the Dharma Initiative...

17:18.455 --> 17:21.037
They did wipe them out, Hugo...

17:21.124 --> 17:23.285
...but it wasn't my decision.

17:24.419 --> 17:27.536
- Then whose was it?
- Their leader's.

17:27.631 --> 17:30.213
I thought you were their leader.

17:32.302 --> 17:33.462
Not always.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.688
A cabin.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.190
He was building it.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.492
Did you find what you were looking for?

18:00.372 --> 18:02.237
Yes, Hugo, I believe I did.

18:08.672 --> 18:10.754
- I need your key.
- What?

18:10.840 --> 18:13.752
Captain, Mayhewjust died.

18:13.843 --> 18:18.587
Doc couldn't do anything for him. Crew's
asking what happened to you over there.

18:18.682 --> 18:20.968
You tell the crew
that I'm dealing with it,

18:21.059 --> 18:24.267
then go gas up the chopper, Frank.
We're going back.

18:24.354 --> 18:28.472
- Going back? What the hell for?
- Gas up the chopper, Frank.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.275
OK.

18:33.488 --> 18:37.026
Listen, Martin, while you were gone,

18:37.117 --> 18:39.233
there was some sort of a sickness.

18:39.327 --> 18:44.037
The crew exhibited very strange
behavior. Regina went overboard.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.706
I would be derelict in my duty
if I didn't point out

18:46.793 --> 18:49.409
this might be exactly
what's happening to you.

18:50.046 --> 18:52.162
I appreciate your concern.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.965
Give me your key.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.464
That's not the protocol...

19:01.099 --> 19:02.305
Thank you.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.646
The reason there are two keys

19:10.734 --> 19:13.476
is we're only supposed
to open the safe together.

19:13.570 --> 19:14.980
You're here, aren't you?

19:18.158 --> 19:21.070
- What's that?
- This is secondary protocol.

19:25.332 --> 19:28.449
- What does it say?
- It says where Linus is going.

19:29.419 --> 19:32.832
- How would Mr. Widmore know that?
- He's a very smart man.

19:32.922 --> 19:36.164
And if Linus knows
we're gonna torch the island,

19:36.259 --> 19:38.841
there's only one place he can go.

19:38.928 --> 19:43.262
What do you mean "torch the island"?
That was not the agreement.

19:43.350 --> 19:46.262
I agreed to ferry you here
for an extraction mission.

19:51.274 --> 19:52.775
Fix my gun.

20:03.953 --> 20:08.162
That injured man, that was no gunshot.

20:11.586 --> 20:13.417
What'd you think happened to him?

20:13.505 --> 20:14.961
I don't know.

20:15.048 --> 20:18.711
But when they go back they'll be certain
it doesn't happen again.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.291
Omar!

20:22.389 --> 20:24.095
Keamy wants you in the armory.

20:24.182 --> 20:27.049
I wasn't supposed to let those two
fall out of my sight.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.553
I'll watch them. Go.

20:29.771 --> 20:33.059
[Morse code beeping]

20:38.655 --> 20:42.068
There's a pantry below our galley
with enough room for two men.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.535
I left you a supply of food and water.
Go there.

20:44.619 --> 20:47.531
- Michael, is he dead?
- No, not for lack of trying,

20:47.622 --> 20:51.080
which is why you two need to hide
before Keamy comes back to deck.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.499
Hiding is pointless.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.087
Give us your Zodiac raft

20:55.171 --> 20:58.334
so we can start ferrying people
back here from the beach.

20:58.967 --> 21:01.128
The only way to save our lives

21:01.219 --> 21:03.631
is to get our people off that island.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.841
Meet me behind the container
in ten minutes.

21:10.979 --> 21:12.890
The boat will be in the water.

21:19.028 --> 21:21.019
[Locke] Cabin's here.

21:21.114 --> 21:24.231
They came over there, up the coast.

21:25.368 --> 21:26.574
Here you go.

21:28.538 --> 21:29.778
Drink up, dude.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.452
Digging through dead bodies
takes it out of you.

21:33.543 --> 21:35.374
It's gonna be dark soon, Hugo.

21:35.462 --> 21:38.329
If you head that way
you'll hit the coast

21:38.423 --> 21:41.756
and all you have to do is take it north
until you reach our beach.

21:41.843 --> 21:45.210
- Uh... What?
- I forced you to come at gunpoint.

21:45.305 --> 21:47.466
I'm sorry, Hugo,
but I was led to believe

21:47.557 --> 21:49.593
we needed you to find this place.

21:49.684 --> 21:53.393
I get it. Now you got your magic map
you don't need me anymore.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.562
I'm offering you a chance to leave.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.890
I don't want to put you
in harm's way against your will.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.977
And wandering through the jungle
by myself will be safer?

22:02.071 --> 22:03.572
I'm not sure it is.

22:05.074 --> 22:07.030
I think I'll stick with you guys.

22:07.118 --> 22:08.779
This way?

22:14.501 --> 22:15.911
What?

22:16.002 --> 22:18.789
He actually thinks staying was his idea.

22:20.465 --> 22:22.672
Not bad, John. Not bad at all.

22:24.928 --> 22:26.168
I'm not you.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.131
You're certainly not.

22:39.484 --> 22:42.601
- [pounding]
- [boy] Somebody! Let me out!

22:42.695 --> 22:44.356
Please let me out.

22:46.366 --> 22:50.359
- John, you OK?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.779
[man] Get to class, ladies!
Tardy bell just rang.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.827
John, you're bleeding. Come on.

22:56.918 --> 22:58.909
Let's go to the nurse's office.

23:02.632 --> 23:04.247
[man] You want to talk about it?

23:04.968 --> 23:06.128
No.

23:09.430 --> 23:11.842
I know you're probably
upset right now,

23:11.933 --> 23:14.265
but I do have some
exciting news for you.

23:14.352 --> 23:17.185
I got a call from Portland recently.

23:17.272 --> 23:20.685
There's a company up there
doing some very exciting things

23:20.775 --> 23:22.857
in chemistry and new technologies.

23:22.944 --> 23:25.310
They're called Mittelos Laboratories.

23:26.614 --> 23:27.990
I spoke with a Dr. Alpert.

23:28.074 --> 23:31.532
He's very interested
in finding young, bright minds

23:31.619 --> 23:33.951
to enter in these new fields of science.

23:34.038 --> 23:36.825
They want you to go to their camp
this summer.

23:37.875 --> 23:40.207
- Science camp?
- Yes.

23:41.004 --> 23:43.461
Don't you understand
things like science camp

23:43.548 --> 23:45.755
are the reason
I get stuffed into lockers?

23:45.842 --> 23:48.925
- This is a great opportunity...
- How do they know about me?

23:49.012 --> 23:51.253
They must've sent a rep
to the science fair.

23:51.347 --> 23:55.010
- Your display at Costa Mesa...
- I'm not a scientist!

23:55.852 --> 23:59.265
I like boxing and fishing and cars.

23:59.355 --> 24:01.095
I like sports.

24:02.233 --> 24:06.693
I'm gonna tell you something, something
I wish someone had told me at your age.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.270
You might not want to be
that guy in the lab

24:09.365 --> 24:13.108
surrounded by test tubes and beakers,

24:13.202 --> 24:14.863
but that's who you are, John.

24:17.081 --> 24:19.663
You can't be the prom king.

24:19.751 --> 24:21.867
You can't be the quarterback.

24:24.422 --> 24:27.630
You can't be a superhero.

24:29.677 --> 24:33.386
Don't tell me what I can't do.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.685
[door creaks open]

24:47.945 --> 24:49.606
Why didn't you tell me?

24:50.615 --> 24:51.946
Tell you what?

24:53.076 --> 24:55.192
- That you're a survivor of 815.
- [groaning]

24:55.286 --> 24:59.245
- 'Cause you wouldn't have believed me.
- You didn't think I'd believe you?

24:59.332 --> 25:01.914
I tell you I'm one of the only people
in the world

25:02.001 --> 25:04.834
thinking that plane on the bottom
of the ocean is a hoax.

25:04.921 --> 25:08.334
- You didn't think I'd believe you?
- I didn't know I could trust you.

25:08.424 --> 25:11.336
- Your boss put that plane there.
- [chuckling]

25:11.427 --> 25:14.510
Man, I thought I was Mr. Conspiracy.
You got me beat there.

25:17.558 --> 25:20.971
Listen to me, listen to me.
You can't fly that guy back.

25:21.062 --> 25:23.269
- Keamy.
- You let me worry about Keamy...

25:23.356 --> 25:27.520
You can't fly him back. He's
gonna kill everyone on that island.

25:27.610 --> 25:28.975
Everyone.

25:30.863 --> 25:34.276
You don't want that
on your conscience, man. Trust me.

25:49.465 --> 25:51.001
[beeps]

25:51.092 --> 25:52.252
Hey, boss.

25:52.343 --> 25:54.675
Just getting him down
to the engine room.

26:03.896 --> 26:07.184
Stay on a heading of exactly 305.

26:07.275 --> 26:09.561
That's the only safe way
to and from the boat.

26:09.652 --> 26:12.689
What will you tell Keamy if he notices
the Zodiac missing?

26:12.780 --> 26:15.157
I'll tell him you stole it.
Now go.

26:23.583 --> 26:26.495
- Desmond?
- I can't go with you.

26:26.586 --> 26:30.044
- Why not?
- I've been on that island three years.

26:30.131 --> 26:32.998
I'm never setting foot on it again.

26:33.718 --> 26:35.834
Not when Penny's coming for me.

26:39.056 --> 26:41.889
I'll be back with the first group
as soon as I can.

26:43.478 --> 26:45.184
Stay on that bearing, yeah?

26:46.189 --> 26:49.181
- I will.
- You need to go now.

27:18.179 --> 27:21.216
It should be about 200 yards this way.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.389
You sure it's gonna be there, John?

27:24.644 --> 27:27.351
- I'm sorry?
- The cabin. What if it's moved?

27:27.438 --> 27:29.224
- Again.
- It hasn't moved.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.182
Because I was told
that this is where it would be.

27:33.236 --> 27:35.147
I was told a lot of things, too.

27:35.238 --> 27:37.729
That I was chosen, I was special.

27:37.824 --> 27:42.193
I end up with a tumor on my spine
and my daughter's blood on my hands.

27:44.205 --> 27:46.742
I'm sorry those things
happened to you, Ben.

27:49.794 --> 27:51.659
Those things had to happen to me.

27:51.754 --> 27:53.540
That was my destiny.

27:55.424 --> 27:59.758
But you'll understand soon enough
there are consequences to being chosen.

28:01.514 --> 28:04.130
Because destiny, John...

28:04.225 --> 28:06.557
...is a fickle bitch.

28:10.273 --> 28:11.763
[Hurley] Guys?

28:14.235 --> 28:15.896
Cabin.

28:34.547 --> 28:37.630
[gasping]

28:40.261 --> 28:41.250
Come on.

28:48.728 --> 28:51.640
OK, OK, good job. Good job, John.

28:51.731 --> 28:54.063
OK, we'll try some more tomorrow.

28:54.150 --> 28:56.516
He's all yours.

28:58.279 --> 28:59.644
All right. Come on.

29:03.451 --> 29:05.442
Don't give up, Mr. Locke.

29:07.163 --> 29:09.905
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying don't give up.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.489
Anything's possible.

29:13.878 --> 29:15.834
You should read my file.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.253
My spine was crushed.

29:18.341 --> 29:22.209
There's a 98 percent chance I'll never
get any feeling back in my legs.

29:22.303 --> 29:26.171
- I don't know why I'm even...
- Matter of fact, I did read your file.

29:27.183 --> 29:30.516
You survived falling
eight stories out of a building.

29:31.646 --> 29:33.682
That's a miracle, Mr. Locke.

29:38.903 --> 29:40.643
Let me ask you something.

29:42.198 --> 29:43.859
Do you believe in miracles?

29:44.659 --> 29:47.366
No. I don't believe in miracles.

29:48.663 --> 29:51.700
You should. I had one happen to me.

29:58.464 --> 30:01.376
Hey, look, Ijust want to go back
to my room.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.591
Do you know what you need,
Mr. Locke?

30:13.396 --> 30:15.682
You need to go on a walkabout.

30:16.899 --> 30:19.231
Wha... What's a walkabout?

30:19.318 --> 30:21.559
It's a journey of self-discovery.

30:22.738 --> 30:25.070
You go out into the Australian Outback

30:25.157 --> 30:27.569
with nothing more than a knife
and your wits.

30:29.036 --> 30:30.947
I can't walkabout anything.

30:31.038 --> 30:34.075
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a cripple.

30:36.043 --> 30:38.034
Is that what you are, Mr. Locke?

30:39.839 --> 30:42.876
I went on my walkabout
convinced I was one thing.

30:42.967 --> 30:44.707
When I came back, another.

30:45.261 --> 30:48.094
I found out what I was made of,
who I was.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.557
And here you are.

30:50.641 --> 30:51.972
An orderly.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.182
Oh, I'm a lot more
than just an orderly, John.

30:58.441 --> 30:59.931
[elevator bell dings]

31:14.206 --> 31:16.367
When you're ready, Mr. Locke,

31:16.459 --> 31:18.415
you'll listen to what I'm saying.

31:18.502 --> 31:21.744
And then, when you and me
run into each other again...

31:24.675 --> 31:26.631
...you'll owe me one.

31:49.700 --> 31:50.906
Hey, doc.

31:52.036 --> 31:53.901
You want to hear something weird?

31:55.331 --> 31:56.662
Yeah, sure.

31:56.749 --> 31:59.741
You know that Morse code message
I got from the beach?

31:59.835 --> 32:03.419
It said the doctor washed up
on the shore with his throat slit.

32:04.715 --> 32:06.125
But I'm a doctor.

32:07.051 --> 32:08.291
Crazy, right?

32:09.261 --> 32:10.671
Everything here?

32:11.347 --> 32:13.679
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Get it packed up.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.523
What are you gonna do with all that?

32:22.525 --> 32:24.686
Fire it up, Frank.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.774
Mr. Keamy,
I was hired to fly scientists.

32:30.157 --> 32:33.524
Get your ass in the cockpit
and fire up the chopper, Frank.

32:34.036 --> 32:35.242
I'm not taking you.

32:41.544 --> 32:43.125
I'll kill you, Frank.

32:43.212 --> 32:46.545
Yeah, well, you do that,
you'll never get back to the island.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.293
I'm the only pilot you got.

32:57.226 --> 33:01.185
- Sorry, doc.
- [doctor gasping]

33:06.443 --> 33:09.230
That change anything, Frank? Huh?

33:09.321 --> 33:11.653
Another 30 seconds goes by,
someone else's turn.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.901
- [gunshot]
- [gun cocking]

33:15.244 --> 33:17.576
I fixed your gun.

33:21.250 --> 33:24.834
Now stand down, Martin, or I will fire.

33:33.804 --> 33:36.136
I don't think you want to do that,
captain.

33:36.223 --> 33:38.680
What's that on his arm?

33:38.767 --> 33:40.303
What's that on his arm?

33:43.272 --> 33:44.978
[moans]

33:50.946 --> 33:52.277
Hey!

33:54.450 --> 33:56.691
What'll it be, Frank?

33:59.830 --> 34:01.161
We're flying.

34:05.628 --> 34:08.040
[Keamy] Come on,
let's go, boys. Come on.

34:08.130 --> 34:10.667
Get the rest of the weapons onboard
and let's go!

34:15.971 --> 34:18.883
[helicopter engine starting]

34:18.974 --> 34:21.716
[beeping]

34:30.611 --> 34:32.067
Thanks, captain.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.194
Come on, come on! Let's go!

35:11.110 --> 35:12.270
Hey!

35:12.361 --> 35:13.476
What did I say to you?

35:14.822 --> 35:16.813
You told me not to leave my tent.

35:17.366 --> 35:19.106
I was hungry.

35:19.201 --> 35:21.613
Jack, you have to rest.
You can't run around.

35:21.704 --> 35:24.286
I know it's hard for you
to ask for help,

35:24.373 --> 35:28.958
- but if you tear your stitches...
- Relax, OK? I got it.

35:29.044 --> 35:31.786
- Doctors make the worst patients.
- [Jack chuckles]

35:31.880 --> 35:33.871
[helicopter approaching]

36:14.757 --> 36:15.997
Jack!

36:16.091 --> 36:19.583
[beeping]

36:44.453 --> 36:46.614
I think they want us to follow them.

37:01.637 --> 37:02.877
All right.

37:02.971 --> 37:04.381
Let's do this.

37:05.099 --> 37:06.839
I'm not going in there with you.

37:07.476 --> 37:10.718
- What?
- The island wanted me to get sick.

37:10.813 --> 37:12.599
They wanted you to get well.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.727
My time is over, John.

37:18.487 --> 37:19.818
It's yours now.

37:22.408 --> 37:25.650
Yeah, I'm cool with you
going in alone, too.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.164
Good luck, John.

38:40.402 --> 38:41.938
Are you Jacob?

38:44.239 --> 38:45.319
No.

38:47.075 --> 38:49.908
But I can speak on his behalf.

38:59.713 --> 39:01.294
Well, who are you?

39:04.593 --> 39:06.299
I'm Christian.

39:27.741 --> 39:29.197
Do you know why I'm here?

39:31.745 --> 39:33.281
Yeah, sure.

39:34.081 --> 39:35.412
Do you?

39:40.754 --> 39:42.085
I'm here...

39:43.882 --> 39:46.089
...because I was chosen to be.

39:50.681 --> 39:52.546
That's absolutely right.

39:53.934 --> 39:55.265
[creaking]

40:05.028 --> 40:06.313
Claire?

40:07.155 --> 40:08.486
Hi, John.

40:09.324 --> 40:10.780
What are you doing here?

40:10.867 --> 40:13.950
Don't worry, I'm fine. I'm with him.

40:17.583 --> 40:20.575
- Where's the baby?
- Where he's supposed to be.

40:20.669 --> 40:22.000
And that's not here.

40:24.172 --> 40:27.084
It's probably best
that you don't tell anyone

40:27.175 --> 40:29.427
- that you saw her.
- Why?

40:29.511 --> 40:31.627
- Why...?
- We don't have time for this.

40:31.722 --> 40:35.306
The people from the boat
are already on their way back.

40:35.392 --> 40:39.055
Once they get here all of these
questions won't matter one bit.

40:39.146 --> 40:42.604
So why don't you ask
the one question that does matter.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.358
How do I save the island?

42:08.902 --> 42:11.109
Did he tell you what
we're supposed to do?

42:13.281 --> 42:14.612
He did.

42:16.451 --> 42:17.827
Well?

42:19.913 --> 42:22.245
He wants us to move the island.
