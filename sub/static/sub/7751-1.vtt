00:10.510 --> 00:12.044
What kind of person are you?!

00:12.078 --> 00:13.879
How could you want
to keep this a secret?!

00:13.914 --> 00:15.714
Keep your voice down!
Think about the neighbors!

00:15.749 --> 00:17.650
The neighbors?! I don't care
about the freaking neighbors!

00:17.684 --> 00:18.901
I cannot talk to you
when you're like this!

00:18.902 --> 00:20.119
You're out of your mind!

00:20.153 --> 00:21.854
You're a coward!
I'm gonna tell everyone!

00:21.888 --> 00:24.089
It happened! What do you want me
to do about it now?!

00:24.124 --> 00:25.458
Ethan, what are you doing?

00:25.492 --> 00:28.360
I told you to go to bed
an hour ago.

00:28.395 --> 00:29.895
Mama, look.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.964
What are you gonna do?! Huh?!
I'm gonna tell everyone!

00:31.998 --> 00:33.066
I'm gonna tell everyone...

00:33.067 --> 00:34.934
Give me those keys!
You can't drive right now!

00:34.968 --> 00:36.068
Stop it!

00:39.706 --> 00:41.373
Opal!

00:41.408 --> 00:42.575
Get out here!

Dahlia!

01:07.601 --> 01:08.634
Wait!

01:08.668 --> 01:10.002
What are you doing?

01:10.036 --> 01:11.403
Haven't you heard?

01:11.438 --> 01:13.072
Confession
is good for the soul.

01:13.106 --> 01:15.774
You've had too much to drink.
Let's talk about this back home.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.576
No more talking!

01:17.611 --> 01:19.745
They need to know
what happened.

01:19.779 --> 01:21.680
If you say anything,
Nick could go to jail...

01:21.715 --> 01:22.648
Who cares?

01:22.682 --> 01:25.484
I can't sleep.
I can't eat.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.186
Why doesn't anyone understand
what this has done to me?

01:27.220 --> 01:29.755
It's been hard for all of us,
Dahlia. Listen...

01:29.789 --> 01:31.123
Don't touch me!

01:31.157 --> 01:32.925
He's only trying to help,
Dahlia.

01:32.959 --> 01:36.462
The only way that you can help
is to let me end this.

01:36.496 --> 01:38.597
I will not let you do that.
Do you understand me?

01:38.632 --> 01:40.533
Let me go! Stop!

01:42.002 --> 01:44.870
You are hurting her!

01:56.716 --> 02:00.619
I knew she was struggling
with mental illness, but...

02:00.654 --> 02:02.454
I had no idea
my wife was suicidal.

02:02.489 --> 02:05.925
We were begging her
to come home, and she...

02:05.959 --> 02:07.693
Jumped off the bridge.

02:07.727 --> 02:10.329
Did she say anything
beforehand?

02:10.363 --> 02:12.998
No, nothing...
Nothing that made any sense.

02:13.033 --> 02:16.502
She just... jumped.

02:18.104 --> 02:20.773
What about you, son?

02:20.807 --> 02:23.642
Did you see what happened?

02:32.819 --> 02:34.753
She jumped.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.609
What is that?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.878
I'm going to propose tonight.

03:01.047 --> 03:02.781
You barely know this woman.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.184
I know that I love her.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.753
I'm moving on with my life.
You should be happy for me.

03:07.787 --> 03:09.855
Well, when you put it
like that...

03:09.889 --> 03:11.023
You two done?

03:11.057 --> 03:13.258
She's here.

03:14.761 --> 03:16.195
Show her in.

03:17.664 --> 03:20.532
Will she still love you
when she finds out what you did?

03:20.567 --> 03:22.001
She better not.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.506
Hey, there.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.611
Hello, my darling.

03:43.264 --> 03:48.629
<b>- sync and corrections by Zac -

03:52.499 --> 03:54.667
Rosie Falta,
when you entered this country,

03:54.701 --> 03:57.202
you were not processed
by an immigration officer.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.172
You are thereby removable
from the United States.

04:00.206 --> 04:02.541
However, I understand
you are seeking asylum.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.176
Yes, your honor.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.911
To go back to Mexico would
put Ms. Falta's life in danger.

04:05.945 --> 04:07.613
She fears retaliation
from the drug cartel

04:07.647 --> 04:08.981
that killed her husband,
Ernesto.

04:09.015 --> 04:10.315
Hey. How's it going?

04:10.350 --> 04:11.784
We're not sure.
They just started.

04:11.818 --> 04:13.252
Yeah.

04:13.286 --> 04:14.787
So, what happened last night?

04:14.821 --> 04:16.288
Oh, nothing.

04:16.322 --> 04:18.791
Nicholas proposed last night.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.894
- That's not real.
- Yes, it is!

04:21.928 --> 04:23.529
So, how rich is this guy?

04:23.563 --> 04:26.298
I'm not sure, but we had
pheasant for dinner.

04:26.332 --> 04:29.268
So, are you gonna have kids,
or would you like

04:29.302 --> 04:31.336
to adopt a 40-year-old woman
from Boyle Heights?

04:35.375 --> 04:36.975
Is someone laughing
in my courtroom?

04:39.746 --> 04:42.648
Ms. Falta, we will hear your
case for asylum in six months.

04:42.682 --> 04:44.750
Until then,
you are released in good faith.

04:48.054 --> 04:50.289
Oh, my God!

04:50.323 --> 04:51.557
Come here!

04:51.591 --> 04:54.126
Thank you all so much...

04:54.160 --> 04:56.195
For finding me this lawyer,

04:56.229 --> 04:58.297
for standing by me.

04:58.331 --> 05:00.899
There's nothing we wouldn't do
for our Rosie.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.334
I have an idea...

05:02.368 --> 05:03.635
Why don't we all have dinner
tonight to celebrate?

05:03.670 --> 05:04.703
Yeah!
Perfect.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.072
Actually, I can't tonight.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.977
There is someone I need to see.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.147
Spence?

05:16.549 --> 05:19.051
I spoke to Braden...
He got us an amazing deal

05:19.085 --> 05:21.754
on this hotel in Paris
right on the Champs-ElysÃ©es.

05:21.788 --> 05:24.289
Yeah, about that...

05:24.324 --> 05:25.657
You know, I was thinking...

05:25.692 --> 05:28.727
Paris is so far
for a one-week vacation.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.829
What about Puerto Vallarta?

05:30.864 --> 05:32.798
I guess we could do
the tropical thing.

05:32.832 --> 05:33.799
Yeah.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.734
I'd get massages.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.336
You can work on your tan.

05:37.370 --> 05:38.837
Yeah, you know, maybe one day,

05:38.872 --> 05:42.608
we could take a side trip to...
Guadalajara.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.310
To see Rosie.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.513
Well, it's been three months.

05:47.547 --> 05:49.581
She hasn't returned
any of our calls.

05:49.616 --> 05:52.518
Because she's back
with her friends and family,

05:52.552 --> 05:55.120
speaking Spanish
and drinking margaritas.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.089
I'm sure she doesn't
have time to call us.

05:57.123 --> 05:59.158
I still can't believe
she was deported.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.126
For God's sake, Spence,
why do you keep harping on this?

06:01.161 --> 06:02.795
Because I feel guilty.

06:02.829 --> 06:04.463
Why?

06:04.497 --> 06:06.865
Did you do something
you feel guilty for?

06:06.900 --> 06:08.467
No! I j...

06:08.501 --> 06:11.670
Rosie was taken away from us.
And she's family.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.138
No, Spence.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.240
Rosie was our maid.

06:31.791 --> 06:33.992
You must be Fatima.

06:34.027 --> 06:37.796
It's nice to finally meet you,
Mrs. Powell.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.865
Mr. Powell.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.367
Uh... hello.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.036
How was your trip?

06:44.070 --> 06:45.237
Breathtaking.

06:45.271 --> 06:46.772
Three months in South America,

06:46.806 --> 06:49.508
and we still
didn't want to come home.

06:49.542 --> 06:52.144
Have all of my dinner guests
RSVP?

06:52.178 --> 06:54.012
Everyone will arrive
at 7:00.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.647
Excellent.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.349
Do you mind helping the driver
with the bags?

07:01.321 --> 07:03.355
So, what do you think?

07:03.389 --> 07:06.058
She's... hideous.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.226
She certainly is.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.493
You still don't trust me.

07:08.528 --> 07:10.429
I do.

07:10.463 --> 07:12.931
I see no reason to put chablis
within reach of an alcoholic.

07:12.966 --> 07:16.001
So I'm forced to stare
at that... chunk of sludge

07:16.035 --> 07:17.035
three days a week?

07:17.070 --> 07:18.470
She is here to clean.

07:18.504 --> 07:20.939
It doesn't matter
what she looks like.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.708
Remember?

07:24.210 --> 07:26.812
Forgive me.
Old habits.

07:26.846 --> 07:30.482
The last few months
have been rapturous, Adrian.

07:30.516 --> 07:32.985
Now that we're home,
don't ruin it.

07:33.019 --> 07:34.486
I won't.

07:34.520 --> 07:39.391
Besides,
why would I need chablis...

07:39.425 --> 07:42.127
When I can drink champagne?

07:44.831 --> 07:46.064
That's very sweet.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.167
But we're not
getting rid of her.

08:02.715 --> 08:05.517
You know,
it's a really nice day.

08:05.551 --> 08:08.253
Why don't you go out and spend
some of Phillipe's money?

08:08.288 --> 08:10.222
You mean go shopping?

08:10.256 --> 08:12.291
Zoila, I'm still in mourning.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.927
He's been dead
for three months.

08:14.961 --> 08:17.963
Don't you think you're overdoing
the grieving-widow routine?

08:17.997 --> 08:20.265
My grief is sincere.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.834
The fact that black is slimming
is merely coincidental.

08:25.104 --> 08:27.339
You're depressed.
I get it.

08:27.373 --> 08:29.741
I miss Valentina like crazy.

08:29.776 --> 08:32.144
But at some point,
we have to accept the fact

08:32.178 --> 08:33.879
that life goes on.

08:36.816 --> 08:39.351
When was the last time
you had something to eat?

08:39.385 --> 08:41.620
I had an aspirin for breakfast.

08:42.889 --> 08:45.991
Oh! It's a letter
from Remi!

08:46.025 --> 08:49.094
That's great. We haven't
heard from him in a long time.

08:49.128 --> 08:51.296
How is he?

08:51.331 --> 08:53.065
Does he say anything
about Valentina?

08:55.568 --> 08:57.569
Uh, no. He doesn't.

08:57.603 --> 08:58.971
Well, then,
what's in the letter?

09:00.606 --> 09:03.108
Well, you know,
same old, same old.

09:03.142 --> 09:05.277
The natives are restless,
the lepers are whining.

09:05.311 --> 09:06.912
You know what?

09:06.946 --> 09:10.182
<i>I think I will go shopping.</i>

09:10.216 --> 09:12.384
I thought you were in mourning.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.854
I am.

09:15.888 --> 09:19.825
But I can't be selfish.
The U.S. economy needs me.

09:24.597 --> 09:26.298
That was a good one, right?

09:26.332 --> 09:27.499
- It was.
- You're back.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.501
How was the big premiere?

09:29.535 --> 09:31.169
Oh, Odessa, the red carpet

09:31.204 --> 09:33.205
is my favorite place
I've ever been to.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.475
I met all these celebrities,
and everyone was so gorgeous.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.377
I couldn't believe it.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.212
You know, I was actually wondering
how you were handling that.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.214
I know you're used to being
the prettiest one in the room.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.449
Oh. I was still
the prettiest.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.551
But it was nice to have
competition for a change.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.388
Well...

09:49.422 --> 09:51.356
I finally fixed
the garbage disposal.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.391
You'll never guess how.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.892
By the way, did you see

09:53.926 --> 09:55.360
what those women
were wearing tonight?

09:55.395 --> 09:57.262
We have got to discuss
my clothing allowance.

09:57.296 --> 09:58.663
Oh, God.

09:58.698 --> 10:00.599
Let me get a drink first,
please.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.234
Odessa, will you please
get me a Martini?

10:02.268 --> 10:05.237
Ooh. That sounds good.
I'll have one, too.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.972
I'm serious.

10:07.006 --> 10:08.807
If you want me to hang out
with the rich and famous,

10:08.841 --> 10:10.442
mommy's gonna need
some new clothes.

10:10.476 --> 10:11.877
You know,
for a fake girlfriend,

10:11.911 --> 10:13.912
you sound an awful lot
like a real girlfriend.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.147
Don't be so cheap.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.015
I know what you spend
on underwear.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.685
How do I stop
this conversation?

10:20.720 --> 10:23.188
You hand me your platinum card
and walk away.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.892
Thank you, Odessa.

10:29.328 --> 10:33.133
What about mine?

10:33.167 --> 10:35.168
Odessa.

10:38.572 --> 10:39.906
Alejandro, say something.

10:41.275 --> 10:42.442
Good night.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.932
Hello, Valentina.

11:10.538 --> 11:12.639
So, Evelyn,
I just have to ask...

11:12.673 --> 11:15.074
Where did you get
that exquisite necklace?

11:15.109 --> 11:18.878
Adrian gave it to me while we
were cruising down the Amazon.

11:18.913 --> 11:20.914
I bought it the week before
in Buenos Aires.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.716
- Paid a king's ransom for it.
- It was so romantic.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.154
So, you didn't care for Rio?

11:28.189 --> 11:29.355
No.

11:29.390 --> 11:31.624
The poverty was unimaginable.

11:31.659 --> 11:35.528
Streets filled with beggars,
children running around in tatters.

11:35.563 --> 11:38.231
Every time we looked out
our hotel window,

11:38.265 --> 11:41.401
we were confronted with
the reality of human suffering.

11:41.435 --> 11:43.169
Finally,
we called the concierge

11:43.204 --> 11:45.104
and got a room facing the pool.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.507
So much nicer.

11:50.945 --> 11:52.712
Only Rhonda
would be rude enough

11:52.746 --> 11:55.114
to arrive
after the entrÃ©e's been served.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.616
Uh, Fatima, show her in.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.318
But... but...
But try to seem annoyed.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.795
So, I just heard the best gossip
about Nicholas Deering.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.931
You are going to die when
you hear who he's engaged to.

12:11.966 --> 12:15.535
Why?
Is it someone we know?

12:15.569 --> 12:16.669
Excuse me! Miss Evelyn!

12:16.704 --> 12:17.804
Oh!

12:17.838 --> 12:19.138
Aah!

12:24.745 --> 12:27.614
I think they want our jewelry.

12:31.385 --> 12:32.418
Listen to me.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.290
This is Beverly Hills.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.092
You're not gonna
get away with this.

12:39.126 --> 12:43.096
If you leave now,
we won't call the police.

13:02.416 --> 13:04.317
Oh!

13:11.296 --> 13:13.016
Maria?

13:13.074 --> 13:15.509
Who's that at the door?

13:15.543 --> 13:17.044
Hello, Mrs. Peri.

13:20.148 --> 13:23.183
Oh, no!
Are you okay?

13:23.218 --> 13:24.451
I'm fine.

13:24.486 --> 13:27.121
Just...
Surprised to see you.

13:28.556 --> 13:30.491
In America.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.594
Maria!

13:33.628 --> 13:37.231
<i>Limpia this... mess-o.
Andale.</i>

13:37.265 --> 13:40.367
Oh, Mrs. Peri, I thought
I'd never see you again.

13:40.602 --> 13:42.436
Me too.

13:42.470 --> 13:43.570
I really...

13:43.605 --> 13:45.906
Really thought
you were deported.

13:45.940 --> 13:48.609
I was in a detention center
for three months.

13:48.643 --> 13:52.713
But I applied for asylum,
and so I got to stay.

13:52.747 --> 13:55.582
Who knew that was an option?

13:55.617 --> 13:58.585
Well, thanks for stopping by.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.687
Is Mr. Spence here?

14:00.722 --> 14:05.092
- I'd like to see him, too.
- Of course you would.

14:05.126 --> 14:07.794
But...
He's working tonight.

14:08.930 --> 14:10.297
Do you know when he'll be back?

14:11.466 --> 14:12.799
Hard to say.

14:14.102 --> 14:17.704
So, I guess
you've met our new maid.

14:17.739 --> 14:20.173
Maria is such a treasure.

14:20.208 --> 14:21.775
You must be very happy here.

14:21.809 --> 14:25.245
Oh, she has the best time.

14:25.280 --> 14:28.882
So, obviously, we don't
have room for you here anymore,

14:28.917 --> 14:30.784
but if you need a reference...

14:30.818 --> 14:33.120
Unless you're leaving town?

14:33.154 --> 14:36.390
No. I will be
staying in L.A.

14:37.492 --> 14:39.259
Fantastic.

14:39.294 --> 14:43.797
You... you won't forget
to tell Mr. Spence I stopped by?

14:43.831 --> 14:45.566
How could I?

14:46.701 --> 14:49.169
Okay.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.908
How did you find me?

14:54.943 --> 14:57.678
Remi wrote
to tell me you'd come home.

14:57.712 --> 14:59.112
He said you'd fought.

14:59.147 --> 15:02.349
He was working at the clinic
12 hours a day.

15:02.383 --> 15:05.252
Still, I didn't complain, 'cause
I was trying to support him,

15:05.286 --> 15:08.355
but then he said he wanted to
stay in Africa for another year.

15:08.389 --> 15:10.090
And I said,
"what about my career?"

15:10.124 --> 15:12.225
And then he said,
"fashion isn't important

15:12.260 --> 15:13.527
compared to saving lives."

15:13.561 --> 15:15.362
That's silly.

15:15.396 --> 15:17.898
What's the point of living
if there's nothing nice to wear?

15:17.932 --> 15:19.866
Anyway,
that's when we broke up.

15:19.901 --> 15:22.469
Why didn't you tell your mother
you were home?

15:22.503 --> 15:24.471
Didn't you know
she convinced Remi

15:24.505 --> 15:26.139
to go to the Congo without me?

15:26.174 --> 15:28.241
She feels terrible about that.

15:28.276 --> 15:31.244
Well, I'm not ready
to forgive her.

15:31.279 --> 15:33.447
You're gonna have to
face her eventually

15:33.481 --> 15:36.550
because I'm not letting you stay
in this dump one more minute.

15:36.584 --> 15:38.452
I can't stay here anyway.

15:38.486 --> 15:40.220
I'm pretty much out of money.

15:40.254 --> 15:41.521
Then, it's settled.

15:41.556 --> 15:42.889
Start packing up your things.

15:42.924 --> 15:45.225
I'm gonna go get my car
from the valet.

15:46.628 --> 15:48.195
Uh, Mrs. Delatour...

15:48.229 --> 15:50.230
This motel
doesn't have a valet.

15:51.366 --> 15:52.733
Oh, dear.

15:56.704 --> 15:58.772
I spoke to my son today.

15:58.806 --> 16:00.307
He's back east in school.

16:00.341 --> 16:02.943
He thinks Nick and I are crazy

16:02.977 --> 16:04.945
for getting engaged
after only three months

16:04.979 --> 16:06.747
and me moving in.

16:06.781 --> 16:09.449
Certainly is surprising.

16:09.484 --> 16:11.985
Well, we have
so much in common.

16:12.020 --> 16:15.689
I don't know if he mentioned it,
but we met at a rare-book shop.

16:15.723 --> 16:17.090
We were both there

16:17.125 --> 16:19.493
searching for
a first-edition Du Maurier.

16:20.728 --> 16:22.696
One thing led to another,
and here we are.

16:22.730 --> 16:24.731
Yes. Here we are.

16:26.234 --> 16:27.868
I brought some fresh towels
for you.

16:27.902 --> 16:31.338
I assume you'll want to shower
and change before dinner.

16:31.372 --> 16:32.973
<i>Why? I just thought
I would wear this.</i>

16:33.975 --> 16:35.676
Oh.

16:36.711 --> 16:37.944
Something wrong?

16:37.979 --> 16:40.013
No.

16:40.048 --> 16:42.516
It's just...

16:42.550 --> 16:46.687
Dahlia always used to dress
for dinner.

16:46.721 --> 16:50.957
Nicholas was so taken
with her sense of style.

16:52.493 --> 16:54.928
Well, I suppose
I could dress up a little.

16:54.962 --> 16:56.296
What the heck?

16:56.330 --> 16:58.732
Very good, Ms. Suarez.

17:00.001 --> 17:01.902
Please...
Call me Marisol.

17:01.936 --> 17:04.503
I want you to think of me
as a friend.

17:05.906 --> 17:08.974
I will certainly try...

17:11.679 --> 17:13.714
Marisol.

17:17.551 --> 17:21.454
The rubies in that necklace
were blood-red.

17:21.489 --> 17:23.056
I don't expect civil servants

17:23.090 --> 17:24.558
to understand
how impressive that is,

17:24.592 --> 17:26.893
but I do expect you
to get them back.

17:26.928 --> 17:28.595
If there's any other details

17:28.629 --> 17:30.530
the two of you can remember...

17:30.565 --> 17:31.765
Mr. Powell?

17:31.799 --> 17:33.667
What?

17:33.701 --> 17:35.335
Oh, uh... no.

17:35.369 --> 17:38.672
I'm sorry. I have to
get this done before sundown.

17:38.706 --> 17:41.541
Adrian is convinced
the gunmen will come back,

17:41.576 --> 17:44.311
so he's decided to change
every lock in our house.

17:44.345 --> 17:45.979
You know how to change locks?

17:46.013 --> 17:47.214
Aah!

17:48.683 --> 17:50.717
No, he does not.

17:50.752 --> 17:52.953
That latch is a bit stubborn,
but I'll take care of it.

17:52.987 --> 17:55.355
It's going to be fine.

17:56.557 --> 17:58.024
Everything is fine.

18:00.628 --> 18:03.597
Last night was
obviously very upsetting.

18:03.631 --> 18:05.665
My husband is feeling
a bit vulnerable.

18:05.700 --> 18:08.401
Of course.
It's a big house.

18:08.436 --> 18:09.803
Is it just the two of you here?

18:09.837 --> 18:11.872
Well, because of what happened,
our maid quit.

18:11.906 --> 18:15.308
Fatima no longer feels safe
in Beverly Hills,

18:15.343 --> 18:17.577
so she's gone back to Lebanon.

18:17.612 --> 18:20.347
Perhaps you should consider
hiring a bodyguard.

18:20.381 --> 18:23.016
I know a guy.
I think I have his card here.

18:23.050 --> 18:25.685
That sounds like a lot of money
just to have someone babysit us.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.187
Up to you,

18:27.221 --> 18:28.955
but it could keep your husband
from freaking out.

18:30.124 --> 18:32.526
Adrian is not
"freaking out."

18:32.560 --> 18:34.594
He's having
a normal emotional reaction

18:34.629 --> 18:36.696
to a devastating experience.

18:36.731 --> 18:37.964
There's somebody outside.

18:37.999 --> 18:39.432
What?
In the backyard.

18:41.035 --> 18:43.036
Do you see him?

18:43.070 --> 18:46.506
He's clearly casing the house.

18:46.541 --> 18:48.275
Mr. Powell,
that's a tree.

18:54.749 --> 18:56.416
I'll take that card now.

19:08.729 --> 19:10.597
Oh, Nick.

19:25.012 --> 19:27.180
"I see when men love women.

19:27.215 --> 19:29.249
They give them
but little of their lives."

19:29.283 --> 19:33.453
"But women, when they love,
give everything."

19:34.655 --> 19:35.622
Mm.

19:37.692 --> 19:38.825
That's Oscar Wilde.

19:38.860 --> 19:40.994
And this is heavy.

19:41.028 --> 19:44.130
Oh, God. Sorry.

19:44.165 --> 19:45.098
Hm.

19:45.132 --> 19:46.633
Hey, I got you something.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.668
Oh.

19:52.273 --> 19:56.443
A signed copy of an
ideal husband, very clever.

19:56.477 --> 19:58.578
We had to celebrate
you moving in.

19:58.613 --> 20:00.947
Like your other gift
wasn't enough.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.749
My other gift?

20:05.953 --> 20:07.587
What do you think?

20:10.191 --> 20:11.558
Where'd you get those?

20:11.592 --> 20:15.562
I found them on my dresser.
What's wrong?

20:15.596 --> 20:17.664
Those are Dahlia's earrings.

20:19.767 --> 20:21.234
Oh, God.

20:24.605 --> 20:27.107
I took Dahlia's things
out of the bureau

20:27.141 --> 20:29.576
to make room
for Marisol's clothes.

20:29.610 --> 20:32.612
I must have dropped them
while I was leaving.

20:32.647 --> 20:33.914
I'm so sorry.

20:33.948 --> 20:37.817
It's my fault, too.
I shouldn't have assumed.

20:37.852 --> 20:38.952
It's fine.

20:38.986 --> 20:40.353
It's over.

20:40.388 --> 20:44.090
Let's just...
Have a lovely evening.

20:44.125 --> 20:45.892
Okay?

21:21.343 --> 21:22.281
What are you doing?

21:22.849 --> 21:24.934
I can't let the paparazzi
see me.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.753
What? Why not?

21:27.826 --> 21:29.527
Because...

21:29.562 --> 21:31.696
I can't smile.

21:31.730 --> 21:33.731
Of course you can.
Do this.

21:35.034 --> 21:36.267
If those people see me,

21:36.302 --> 21:37.635
they will know
I'm not really happy,

21:37.670 --> 21:39.504
and then
they will talk about you.

21:41.574 --> 21:44.542
Great. Now they're
taking pictures of my ass.

21:46.712 --> 21:47.946
Why aren't you happy?

21:47.980 --> 21:50.248
I'm not respected.

21:50.282 --> 21:52.317
Not true.
I respect you plenty.

21:52.351 --> 21:54.219
Now get your butt
out of this car.

21:54.253 --> 21:56.254
If I'm going to pretend
be your girlfriend,

21:56.288 --> 21:58.790
I have to be treated
like your girlfriend.

21:58.824 --> 22:00.692
Meaning?

22:00.726 --> 22:02.961
When I ask for a Martini,
Odessa should make it for me.

22:02.995 --> 22:04.462
Oh, give me a break!

22:04.496 --> 22:05.863
She's been mean to me
for months.

22:05.898 --> 22:07.565
She won't cook for me
or do my laundry.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.935
I haven't said anything
because I am so nice.

22:10.970 --> 22:12.804
Can't you do your own laundry?

22:12.838 --> 22:14.606
That's not the point,
Alejandro.

22:14.640 --> 22:17.175
I am not downstairs anymore.
I am upstairs.

22:17.209 --> 22:19.010
You shouldn't
let her humiliate me.

22:19.244 --> 22:21.212
Well,
what do you want me to do?

22:21.246 --> 22:23.714
Oh, I'll handle it.

22:23.749 --> 22:25.883
I just need to know
you support me.

22:25.918 --> 22:27.952
Fine.
You have my support.

22:27.986 --> 22:28.986
Can you smile now?

22:43.001 --> 22:45.002
I wanted to thank you again
for dinner last night.

22:45.037 --> 22:47.238
Best beef bourguignon
I've had in years.

22:47.272 --> 22:48.906
Just an old family recipe.

22:48.941 --> 22:50.842
I can share it with you,
if you'd like.

22:50.876 --> 22:52.343
Really?

22:52.377 --> 22:54.612
See, I thought
you didn't like me.

22:54.646 --> 22:56.781
Now, why would you say
something like that?

22:58.917 --> 23:02.286
You didn't just leave
those earrings on the dresser.

23:02.321 --> 23:04.322
You wanted me to think
they were a gift

23:04.356 --> 23:06.524
so that I would upset Nicholas.

23:07.960 --> 23:12.063
Don't bother lying.
You'll just... annoy me.

23:16.201 --> 23:17.368
You're right.

23:17.402 --> 23:19.837
I did it on purpose.

23:19.872 --> 23:23.074
I think you know
what my next question will be.

23:23.108 --> 23:24.642
"Why?"

23:24.676 --> 23:27.144
I wanted you to see
how he'd react.

23:27.179 --> 23:32.416
Even now, the slightest reminder
of her devastates him.

23:32.451 --> 23:34.986
Dahlia died 15 years ago.

23:35.020 --> 23:36.521
I think Nicholas is ready
to move on.

23:36.555 --> 23:38.089
You didn't see him with Dahlia.

23:38.123 --> 23:39.957
I know he loved her very much.

23:39.992 --> 23:41.659
He's told me all about her.

23:41.693 --> 23:44.529
Did he mention
that she committed suicide?

23:49.601 --> 23:51.969
He didn't tell you.

23:52.004 --> 23:55.106
They had a terrible fight.

23:55.140 --> 23:58.910
And then she threw herself
off a bridge.

24:02.648 --> 24:05.182
I have
a lot of unpacking to do.

24:05.217 --> 24:06.317
If you'll excuse me...

24:06.351 --> 24:08.185
I don't want to hurt you,
Marisol,

24:08.220 --> 24:10.121
but you need to understand...

24:10.155 --> 24:13.024
Nicholas is not ready
to love again.

24:13.058 --> 24:15.927
<i>And he probably never will be.</i>

24:21.500 --> 24:22.567
Darling?

24:22.601 --> 24:24.268
Is the interview going well?

24:24.303 --> 24:25.803
Have you found a bodyguard yet?

24:25.837 --> 24:27.371
Oh, Evelyn,
you have to meet him.

24:27.406 --> 24:29.407
Tony is everything
we could have asked for.

24:29.441 --> 24:31.075
He worked for the Mossad.

24:31.109 --> 24:33.477
He was also head of security
for this Caribbean dictator.

24:33.512 --> 24:35.646
Everyone was trying to
assassinate the guy... uh-huh.

24:35.681 --> 24:38.549
Because he's so evil,
but Tony kept him alive.

24:38.584 --> 24:41.319
Well, that's a good reference.

24:41.353 --> 24:43.187
I thought so, too.

24:43.221 --> 24:44.655
Now, this can't take long.

24:44.690 --> 24:46.424
I have got to get a maid
in here by Friday.

24:46.458 --> 24:47.892
It'll just take a second.

24:47.926 --> 24:50.995
Tony. I would like
for you to meet my wife.

24:54.700 --> 24:56.000
Evelyn!

24:56.034 --> 24:58.035
- Are you okay?
- Oh!

24:58.070 --> 25:00.137
That step is very...
And with these new shoes...

25:00.172 --> 25:02.106
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm Evelyn Powell.

25:02.140 --> 25:03.608
And I'm Tony Bishara,

25:03.642 --> 25:06.310
and I look forward to protecting
you and your husband.

25:08.647 --> 25:11.115
And Tony will be living here?

25:11.149 --> 25:12.416
Absolutely.

25:16.355 --> 25:18.289
Whatever makes you happy,
darling.

25:24.296 --> 25:25.329
Peri?

25:28.433 --> 25:29.433
Hey, you!

25:29.468 --> 25:31.268
You're in a good mood.

25:31.303 --> 25:34.505
That's because I have great news
and amazing news.

25:34.539 --> 25:36.173
Okay. I'm all ears.

25:36.208 --> 25:39.043
Well, you're not
gonna believe it, but...

25:39.077 --> 25:39.977
Rosie's back.

25:41.279 --> 25:42.813
From Mexico?

25:42.848 --> 25:45.416
Turns out she wasn't...
Actually deported.

25:45.450 --> 25:47.184
Seriously?

25:47.219 --> 25:49.020
Fun, huh?

25:49.054 --> 25:50.454
So...

25:50.489 --> 25:52.323
Are you ready
for the amazing news?

25:52.357 --> 25:54.392
Y-yeah, I guess. I don't know
how you're gonna top that.

25:54.426 --> 25:56.560
Oh, I can, Spence.

25:56.595 --> 25:58.262
I'm pregnant.

26:07.359 --> 26:09.522
Please...
Turn that off.

26:09.605 --> 26:10.972
I'm begging you.

26:13.175 --> 26:15.010
How was the charity gala?

26:15.044 --> 26:18.079
It was fun.
But I had too much to drink.

26:18.114 --> 26:20.181
Too bad.

26:26.922 --> 26:28.590
You know...

26:28.624 --> 26:31.826
I hear eggs are really good
for a hangover.

26:31.861 --> 26:34.295
And I saw you make Alejandro
an omelet last week

26:34.330 --> 26:35.964
with ham and cheese.

26:35.998 --> 26:37.932
It looked fantastic.

26:39.001 --> 26:41.603
Can you make me one?
Please?

26:43.205 --> 26:44.372
That's it?

26:44.407 --> 26:47.108
Yeah.
Just an omelet.

26:51.313 --> 26:52.480
Odessa!

26:55.718 --> 26:57.252
Are you making me breakfast
or not?

26:58.454 --> 26:59.654
Not.

27:01.190 --> 27:03.591
It isn't my fault
Alejandro picked me

27:03.626 --> 27:04.859
to be his girlfriend.

27:04.893 --> 27:06.261
What?!

27:06.295 --> 27:07.895
And it's silly
to be jealous of me

27:07.930 --> 27:10.598
just because I'm going to some
fancy parties and premieres.

27:10.633 --> 27:12.166
Y-you think I'm jealous?

27:12.201 --> 27:16.471
Pretending we're a couple
has been hard on me, too.

27:16.505 --> 27:19.641
So please...
I need your support,

27:19.675 --> 27:22.510
even if it's just
making me a stupid omelet.

27:27.816 --> 27:30.652
Come on.
You have to do this.

27:31.787 --> 27:33.821
Or Alejandro will fire you.

27:33.856 --> 27:36.491
I'll save him the trouble.

27:36.525 --> 27:38.860
I quit!

27:49.605 --> 27:51.506
Hey. You must be
Zoila's daughter.

27:51.540 --> 27:53.474
Yeah.
You the new pool boy?

27:53.509 --> 27:55.543
Uh, pool man.

27:55.577 --> 27:57.145
I'm Ethan.

27:57.179 --> 28:00.448
So... you still dating
Richie Mctrust fund?

28:00.482 --> 28:01.582
His name is Remi.

28:01.617 --> 28:02.917
And we broke up.

28:02.951 --> 28:05.453
Oh. Bummer.

28:05.487 --> 28:07.755
Yeah, it is.

28:07.790 --> 28:09.590
Valentina!

28:09.625 --> 28:11.159
Your mother's here.

28:14.330 --> 28:15.830
Guess I'll see you around.

28:26.108 --> 28:27.842
I know you're angry with me...

28:29.611 --> 28:31.512
But can I at least have a hug?

28:48.864 --> 28:52.733
Obviously, what I did was wrong.

28:52.768 --> 28:55.770
And from the bottom of my heart,
I am so sorry.

28:55.804 --> 28:57.638
Thank you.

28:57.673 --> 28:58.806
So...

29:00.609 --> 29:02.076
Anything you
want to say to me?

29:02.110 --> 29:03.711
Like what?

29:03.745 --> 29:07.381
I thought you might want
to apologize, too.

29:07.416 --> 29:09.083
You left to Africa
without telling me.

29:09.117 --> 29:10.551
You came back
without telling me.

29:10.586 --> 29:11.953
I've been worried sick.

29:11.987 --> 29:13.654
Mami! If you hadn't done
what you did...

29:13.689 --> 29:14.922
You're right.

29:16.358 --> 29:19.760
Let's call it even.
Go get your stuff.

29:19.795 --> 29:21.863
I'm gonna take you home.

29:21.897 --> 29:24.365
I'm not coming back home.

29:26.001 --> 29:27.435
Where do you plan on staying?

29:27.469 --> 29:30.171
Here. Mrs. Delatour
said I could.

29:32.040 --> 29:34.442
She can't go back
to that awful motel.

29:34.476 --> 29:37.845
It's in east L.A., which is
a horrible neighborhood.

29:37.880 --> 29:41.682
- I live in east L.A.!
- So you know.

29:43.185 --> 29:45.786
You really think I'm gonna
let you sponge off my employer

29:45.821 --> 29:47.855
when you have a nice home
to go to?

29:47.890 --> 29:49.423
I'm not scared of you anymore,

29:49.458 --> 29:51.592
and that means
you can't tell me what to do.

29:52.728 --> 29:54.929
You're absolutely right.

29:54.963 --> 29:56.797
I can't tell you what to do.

29:56.832 --> 29:58.633
Finally.

29:58.667 --> 30:00.535
But I can tell you what to do.

30:00.569 --> 30:01.836
Huh?

30:01.870 --> 30:03.271
Tell my daughter

30:03.305 --> 30:05.006
there's no longer
any room in your mansion.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.574
You don't have to
listen to her.

30:07.876 --> 30:11.812
Oh, sweetie, you may not be
afraid of your mother, but I am.

30:11.847 --> 30:13.781
Fine!

30:13.815 --> 30:15.917
I can take care of myself!

30:15.951 --> 30:17.785
Now where are you going?!

30:17.819 --> 30:19.453
To live my life!

30:19.488 --> 30:22.890
Which is no longer
any of your business.

30:27.529 --> 30:29.897
She quit?!
What did you say to her?!

30:29.932 --> 30:31.899
I barely said anything.

30:31.934 --> 30:33.501
And she started
acting all crazy.

30:33.535 --> 30:35.036
I think
she's been drinking again.

30:35.070 --> 30:37.505
Ohh, this is not good, Carmen.

30:37.539 --> 30:40.074
Don't be such a drama queen.
We can hire somebody else.

30:40.108 --> 30:41.876
Are you insane?!

30:41.910 --> 30:44.078
We sleep in different rooms!
We lead separate lives!

30:44.112 --> 30:45.880
How long do you think
it will take someone

30:45.914 --> 30:48.049
to figure out
this is a fake relationship?

30:48.083 --> 30:49.417
But if we don't hire a maid,

30:49.451 --> 30:51.018
who's gonna clean up
around here?

30:55.757 --> 30:57.892
No, no, no, no, no!

30:57.926 --> 30:59.694
I'm upstairs now!
I'm gonna be your wife!

30:59.728 --> 31:00.795
Lots of wives clean.

31:00.829 --> 31:02.163
In Beverly Hills?

31:02.197 --> 31:04.765
What's the big deal?
You used to be the maid.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.467
And I sucked.

31:06.501 --> 31:09.704
Well, you should've thought of
that before you pissed off Odessa.

31:16.657 --> 31:18.220
Aah!

31:18.591 --> 31:20.091
The gunmen!

31:20.126 --> 31:22.194
- What about them?
- They're here. I saw them.

31:22.228 --> 31:24.863
No.

31:24.897 --> 31:26.398
You just had a bad dream.

31:28.201 --> 31:29.268
Are you sure?

31:29.302 --> 31:31.103
I told you this would happen

31:31.137 --> 31:33.305
if you mixed Ethiopian food
with Percocet.

31:44.617 --> 31:46.051
I heard someone scream.

31:46.085 --> 31:48.887
Mr. Powell
had a nightmare.

31:48.922 --> 31:51.823
- Are you okay?
- He's fine.

31:51.858 --> 31:53.759
Darling, I'm gonna
go down to the kitchen

31:53.793 --> 31:55.994
and fix you some warm milk.

31:56.029 --> 31:58.030
Will you be all right
until I get back?

31:59.732 --> 32:01.967
Oh, for God's sake,
just say yes.

32:02.001 --> 32:04.069
Yes.

32:14.614 --> 32:16.448
You shouldn't worry
about Mr. Powell.

32:16.482 --> 32:18.183
He'll be fine.
It'll just take a while.

32:18.217 --> 32:20.118
That is why I do worry.

32:20.153 --> 32:23.221
My husband
is greedy and conniving

32:23.256 --> 32:25.123
and lecherous and profane,

32:25.158 --> 32:28.460
and he is also the most fascinating
man I have ever known.

32:28.494 --> 32:30.262
That's why
I've been able to love him

32:30.296 --> 32:31.863
through
the most trying of times.

32:31.898 --> 32:35.000
But this robbery has revealed
a new side to Adrian,

32:35.034 --> 32:36.735
and it frightens me,

32:36.769 --> 32:38.572
because there's one thing
that I cannot tolerate...

32:40.707 --> 32:42.641
And that is weakness.

32:42.675 --> 32:45.944
I know this is
a difficult time for you.

32:45.979 --> 32:47.613
That's why I'm here.

32:47.647 --> 32:51.183
So if there is anything
I can do to help you...

32:54.253 --> 32:56.221
Just try to wear a shirt.

33:14.674 --> 33:17.009
I know Dahlia killed herself.

33:19.178 --> 33:21.313
Why didn't you tell me?

33:21.347 --> 33:23.715
W... you know,

33:23.750 --> 33:26.785
it's not something...
I like to talk about.

33:26.819 --> 33:29.254
But...
We're going to be married.

33:29.288 --> 33:30.789
Yeah,
and... and I was...

33:30.823 --> 33:32.891
I was gonna tell you,
like, when...

33:32.925 --> 33:35.293
When what? When... when there
was a lull in the conversation?

33:37.130 --> 33:38.330
I never told you

33:38.364 --> 33:40.132
'cause I was worried
I'd scare you off.

33:40.166 --> 33:42.768
My wife killed herself.

33:42.802 --> 33:46.204
Some people hear that, they...

33:46.239 --> 33:48.173
They assume I'm to blame.

33:48.207 --> 33:51.476
They wonder if I did
everything I could to help her.

33:52.812 --> 33:55.414
Sometimes I wonder
if maybe they're right.

33:58.951 --> 34:02.487
You know what? We don't have to
keep talking about this.

34:02.522 --> 34:04.790
I'm good...

34:04.824 --> 34:08.893
As long as you promise me...
No more secrets.

34:08.928 --> 34:10.929
I promise.

34:17.904 --> 34:20.739
So, um...

34:20.773 --> 34:23.074
How'd you hear about Dahlia?

34:23.109 --> 34:24.409
Opal told me.

34:24.444 --> 34:26.378
And I'm glad she did.

34:26.411 --> 34:29.214
I think it was good
for us to talk about this.

34:30.416 --> 34:32.484
Yeah.

34:32.518 --> 34:35.320
We must find a way
to thank her.

34:38.991 --> 34:43.027
I can take all of this
and give you 40 grand for it.

34:46.199 --> 34:48.833
But this, I can't take.

34:48.868 --> 34:51.181
It's too valuable...
Too hot to handle.

34:51.518 --> 34:53.271
That's fine.

34:53.306 --> 34:55.873
We have enough
for what we need to do.

35:05.885 --> 35:07.652
Thanks, man.

35:09.188 --> 35:10.956
Hey.

35:12.258 --> 35:14.326
This is for you, ma'am.

35:15.928 --> 35:17.195
Wear it well.

35:29.298 --> 35:30.796
<i>Mijo! De verdad!</i>

35:30.918 --> 35:32.459
You can't just
throw your toys down!

35:32.460 --> 35:35.404
- You've got to...
- Hey. I got you something, buddy.

35:56.416 --> 35:59.017
- What is that?
- A peace offering.

36:02.021 --> 36:04.389
Come on.
I want you to stay.

36:05.491 --> 36:07.025
Why?

36:07.060 --> 36:08.927
So I can make you omelets
and wash your clothes?

36:08.961 --> 36:11.430
Damn it, Odessa! I don't
understand why you're so angry!

36:11.464 --> 36:12.798
What is going on with you?

36:12.832 --> 36:14.466
Oh, finally! You ask.

36:14.500 --> 36:17.102
Every night, you come home
from your fancy parties

36:17.136 --> 36:19.704
and tell me all about the stars
you met and what they wore.

36:19.739 --> 36:21.540
And that upsets you?
No!

36:21.574 --> 36:24.509
I'm happy for
what has happened to you.

36:24.544 --> 36:27.813
But when you're done telling me
about your fancy new life,

36:27.847 --> 36:29.514
you go back to your room.

36:29.549 --> 36:31.016
You don't think to ask
how my day was.

36:31.050 --> 36:32.317
That's not true.

36:35.121 --> 36:36.521
Is it?

36:36.556 --> 36:40.592
Alejandro can treat me
like the help.

36:40.626 --> 36:42.727
I don't care.

36:42.762 --> 36:44.896
But you...

36:46.065 --> 36:49.768
I thought I mattered to you.

36:49.802 --> 36:51.970
Of course you do.

36:52.004 --> 36:56.675
Odessa.

36:56.709 --> 36:59.511
I am so sorry.

37:03.850 --> 37:04.850
Okay, okay.

37:07.987 --> 37:10.088
Maybe I will stay.

37:10.123 --> 37:11.656
Thank you.

37:13.860 --> 37:15.627
I bought you vodka.

37:15.661 --> 37:17.896
How about
I make us some Martinis

37:17.930 --> 37:19.865
and you can tell me
all about your day?

37:19.899 --> 37:21.933
It was the same
as every other day.

37:21.968 --> 37:24.369
We're low on detergent.
Don't be stupid.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.609
And, yeah, that whole time,

37:30.643 --> 37:33.411
Peri and I thought
you were back in Mexico.

37:33.446 --> 37:36.348
When you didn't come see me,
I wasn't sure

37:36.382 --> 37:38.884
if maybe it was... you
who reported me.

37:38.918 --> 37:40.585
Rosie.

37:40.620 --> 37:43.388
You were so angry with me
when I wouldn't marry you.

37:43.422 --> 37:45.724
I was devastated.
I wasn't angry.

37:47.660 --> 37:49.728
Could it have been
Mrs. Peri?

37:49.762 --> 37:51.830
No. She doesn't know
anything about us.

37:53.099 --> 37:57.502
- So... You two are still married?
- You have to understand...

37:57.537 --> 38:01.439
I thought
you were never coming back.

38:03.876 --> 38:04.876
It's okay.

38:04.911 --> 38:07.412
I understand.

38:09.048 --> 38:11.016
But the thing

38:11.050 --> 38:13.385
Mm-hmm?

38:13.419 --> 38:16.588
Peri is gonna have a baby.

38:17.657 --> 38:18.857
No. No.

38:18.891 --> 38:20.091
This is a complication.

38:20.126 --> 38:22.093
We can still find a way
to be together.

38:30.670 --> 38:34.105
All those months in detention,
I thought about you.

38:34.140 --> 38:36.374
I asked God if it was okay

38:36.409 --> 38:39.010
to break his laws
and be with you.

38:41.581 --> 38:45.050
He has finally answered me,
and...

38:45.084 --> 38:47.152
This time, I must listen.

38:47.186 --> 38:49.921
Can we talk about this?
Please! I love you so much!

38:49.956 --> 38:51.890
I love you.

38:54.427 --> 38:56.861
So much more
than I should have.

39:03.102 --> 39:04.936
I'm glad
we could fit you in today.

39:04.971 --> 39:07.138
What's the emergency?

39:07.173 --> 39:09.874
I need to get pregnant...
Now.

39:18.684 --> 39:19.651
Hey.

39:19.685 --> 39:21.152
Hey.

39:21.187 --> 39:23.255
I-I just talked
to my mom.

39:23.289 --> 39:24.889
She told me
what happened with Zoila.

39:24.924 --> 39:26.558
If you hadn't told anyone
I was back...

39:26.592 --> 39:27.926
I know. I know.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.629
I'm sorry, but...
I was just worried about you.

39:31.931 --> 39:34.199
Look, I can't talk.
I got a job interview.

39:34.233 --> 39:37.936
I-I-I know we fought a lot
those last couple of weeks,

39:37.970 --> 39:39.704
but... but that doesn't mean
that we ha...

39:39.739 --> 39:41.606
Yeah. It does.

39:41.641 --> 39:45.677
I'm sorry.
Now I really have to go.

39:51.617 --> 39:54.519
Hi, there. I understand
you're looking for a maid?

39:55.755 --> 39:57.122
Oh.

39:57.156 --> 40:00.625
Well, you sounded
less attractive on the phone.

40:00.660 --> 40:02.294
Well, come on in.

40:12.738 --> 40:14.239
Hey.

40:14.273 --> 40:16.841
Marisol offered to help me
with my English homework later.

40:16.876 --> 40:18.109
Did she?

40:18.144 --> 40:19.244
Yeah.

40:19.963 --> 40:21.643
She's very nice.

40:26.919 --> 40:31.022
Well, don't get
too attached to her.

40:31.057 --> 40:33.692
She's not gonna be here
much longer.
