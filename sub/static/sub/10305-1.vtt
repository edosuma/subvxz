00:11.880 --> 00:13.552
Hey, Peg.

00:21.440 --> 00:25.911
A fat woman hedgehogged
her way into the shoe store today...

00:28.520 --> 00:33.389
Popcorn air freshener.
That could only mean one thing.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.070
- Bundy night at the movies!
- Bundy night at the movies!

00:40.280 --> 00:44.319
Oh, Peg, you even got the floor sticky,
kust like at the theatre.

00:44.520 --> 00:46.397
You know what else we do
at the theatre?

00:46.600 --> 00:50.070
You're not gonna put M&M's in
your lap and make me hunt for them?

00:50.520 --> 00:54.433
By the time I get there,
they've melted and it gets all gooey.

00:54.880 --> 00:58.839
Well, you know, if you'd get there
sooner, they'd melt in your mouth.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.710
Oh, Peg, it kust doesn't get
any better than this. I owe you one.

01:02.920 --> 01:07.630
- Well, maybe after the movies, Al-
- I said owe, Peg, as in " not pay. "

01:09.480 --> 01:11.072
- Hey.
- Dad.

01:15.840 --> 01:19.469
Have anything I could use to create the
impression we're having a windstorm?

01:19.680 --> 01:22.319
Yes, but he's sitting on it.

01:23.360 --> 01:27.069
See, my date really gets turned on
by scary situations.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.238
Apparently, taking his clothes off
isn't enough.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.116
So I decided
to create a fake tornado.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.356
You know,
my own little natural disaster.

01:35.560 --> 01:39.235
Oh, like one of your
hand-lotion tsunamis?

01:42.320 --> 01:46.199
Now, let's not tease Bud.
He might turn out weird.

01:48.520 --> 01:51.034
You know,
I really did see something on Oprah...

01:51.240 --> 01:55.119
...that said women really do get turned
on by life-threatening situations.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.038
- I know I do.
- Me too.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.993
Why don't you go upstairs
and slip into a dry-cleaning bag...

02:00.200 --> 02:01.679
...see what that does for us?

02:02.160 --> 02:05.232
I'm getting all hot
kust thinking about it.

02:07.280 --> 02:10.157
And you wonder
why I have problems with women.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.432
- No, we don't.
- No, we don't.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:54.000 --> 02:56.912
Looks like we made it kust in time,
Ariel.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.671
That tornado's gonna hit
any second now.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.189
But there's not a cloud in the sky.

03:06.440 --> 03:09.398
Well, haven't you ever heard
of the calm before the storm?

03:09.600 --> 03:15.357
No. But then, I kust realized
the Olsen twins are two people.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.470
Look, why don't you kust
take a look outside...

03:22.680 --> 03:24.398
...and you tell me what you see,
okay?

03:37.920 --> 03:41.117
Wait a minute. Doesn't
lightning come before thunder?

03:42.520 --> 03:44.909
Yeah, sure,
except in very bad storms...

03:45.120 --> 03:49.830
...when the positive and negative ions
make everything, you know, kooky.

03:52.160 --> 03:55.118
Wow, it's getting really
windy out there, Bud.

03:55.320 --> 03:58.995
You'd better bring those fans in
before they blow away.

04:00.560 --> 04:04.951
I kust put those fans out there to
create a counter-vortex to the tornado.

04:06.680 --> 04:12.118
Bud, you are so smart and sexy.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.754
I don't know what you see in me.

04:16.279 --> 04:18.396
Hopefully me, in a minute.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.837
These shoes are too big.
I'm swimming in them.

04:25.040 --> 04:28.396
Well, that would explain
the life preserver under your dress.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.149
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.352
You've never been
employee of the month, have you?

04:36.560 --> 04:40.872
That's right, but if I were you,
I wouldn't be going out on any limbs.

04:41.760 --> 04:45.116
Look, I told you, I'm a five.

04:45.320 --> 04:50.474
And you are going to sell me a five
if I have to sit here all night.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.113
So because you're mad at me...

04:52.320 --> 04:55.756
...you're going to take it out
on a perfectly innocent chair...

04:56.520 --> 04:58.511
...a chair that
has suffered enough already.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.473
Well, I have kust about
had enough of you.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.672
You wouldn't say that if I came
with fries and a medium drink.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.553
You know medium,
the size between small and you.

05:16.160 --> 05:20.438
I'm not leaving here
until you help me.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.598
I don't know what I could do that God
and Deal-A-Meal couldn't...

05:23.800 --> 05:25.950
...but I'll give it a shot.

05:27.880 --> 05:32.670
Griff, you got any aspirin?
Or a harpoon?

05:33.800 --> 05:34.915
I'm not talking to you.

05:35.120 --> 05:38.396
I can't believe you're still whining
about that little practical koke.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.716
You sent me to death row.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.750
You made a few close friends.

05:43.960 --> 05:47.396
And they gave you a cool nickname,
Black Beauty.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.754
Mrs. Black Beauty.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.076
You said you wanted to remarry.

05:53.280 --> 05:56.670
Yeah, but not to a 250-pound Filipino.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.518
Since when are you prekudiced?

05:59.520 --> 06:04.150
- They strapped me in the electric chair.
- We'd have rescued you sooner.

06:04.360 --> 06:07.511
But when you order a burger well-done,
it ought to come well-done.

06:07.720 --> 06:10.188
Another few seconds,
you could have cooked it on my lap.

06:10.400 --> 06:14.712
Well, then, where would
Mr. Black Beauty sit?

06:16.280 --> 06:19.431
Excuse me, but am I invisible?

06:20.400 --> 06:22.550
Possibly from Pluto.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.118
Wow, with the money Bud spent
to get those trees to bend...

06:31.320 --> 06:34.073
...he could have kust paid for sex,
like any normal person.

06:35.280 --> 06:39.273
We interrupt Oprah for live coverage
of a local twister.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.672
You know, you gotta give Bud credit.

06:41.880 --> 06:47.557
I mean, those live power lines really
look like they hit that school bus.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.669
Kelly, that really is a twister.

06:50.880 --> 06:54.236
Those kids really are trapped
on that bus.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.910
- Cool.
- Cool?

06:58.120 --> 07:00.634
How could you be so insensitive?

07:00.840 --> 07:03.308
This storm could preempt Oprah.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.435
Peggy, Kelly.

07:13.720 --> 07:16.678
As your civil defence block captain,
I'm taking charge.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.519
You are to follow my orders
without asking any questions.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.917
So we're supposed to act
like Mr. D'Arcy?

07:25.120 --> 07:27.350
I said no questions.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.635
First, unplug all the appliances.

07:30.840 --> 07:33.149
Oh, I did that when we moved in.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.878
Okay. Then we've got to get
to the safest place in the house.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.752
Oh, well, that would be Bud's room...

07:38.960 --> 07:41.076
...because nothing ever happens
down there.

07:41.280 --> 07:42.269
All right, well, hurry.

07:42.480 --> 07:45.631
You've only got time to grab your
most precious, personal possession.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.111
Can I take two?

07:53.720 --> 07:56.393
Somebody help me.

08:03.440 --> 08:08.912
Hey, Al, the wind is really kicking up
on the food court!

08:20.200 --> 08:22.873
This tornado is great.

08:23.520 --> 08:26.239
I'll take a falafel.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.275
I'll bet you would.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.714
All right, now, look.
All right, that's it. Just a minute.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.876
A little bit to leeward.

08:35.720 --> 08:40.589
There. All right, now, do me a favour.
Don't stand up till I get my-

08:44.080 --> 08:47.789
Oh, these feel great.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.912
Do they have a special gel lining?

08:51.120 --> 08:55.557
Yes, that's the blood spurting
from my severed digit.

08:55.760 --> 08:59.878
Well, these are perfect
for my flamenco class.

09:06.640 --> 09:12.158
Help me. Help me. Help me.

09:14.280 --> 09:17.113
Al, we gotta go.
It's getting real scary out there.

09:17.320 --> 09:20.835
Not as scary as it is down here.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.390
Don't worry.
I won't leave you, Buddy.

09:23.880 --> 09:29.273
Help! Help! Help me!

09:29.480 --> 09:31.436
See you, buddy!

09:36.600 --> 09:41.116
I wonder what could happen
to make this situation any worse.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.550
I have to go to the bathroom.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.109
Okay, Marcy.

10:10.320 --> 10:14.871
I opened all the windows, tied down
the rose bushes, turned off the gas...

10:15.080 --> 10:18.595
...and cut your underwear
into tiny little pieces.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.035
Why'd you do that?

10:20.240 --> 10:23.596
Because I wanted to be
the block captain.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.030
Well, you're not.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.834
Hey, Mom, do you think Dad's safe
from the tornado?

10:29.040 --> 10:34.239
Oh, honey, I'm sure he's protected
by his "cone of smell. "

10:35.160 --> 10:38.470
Yeah, but what if
it's like The Wizard of Oz?

10:39.000 --> 10:41.036
Kelly, what are you thinking?

10:41.240 --> 10:45.392
Daddy's gonna get sucked up by a
tornado, spin around in the air...

10:45.600 --> 10:48.239
...and then land smack
on some wicked witch?

10:49.080 --> 10:52.914
Help!

10:59.520 --> 11:01.590
I'm home.

11:01.880 --> 11:06.954
Well, I guess all we need now
is to have a house fall on us.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.592
Cool.

11:28.680 --> 11:32.116
I told you I was a size five.

11:34.760 --> 11:39.197
Well, Al, so much
for your little threesome fantasy.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.790
Oh, that was no threesome, Peg.
That was a fivesome.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.433
Oh, why, oh, why,
did I have to land here?

11:46.640 --> 11:49.996
Why couldn't it have been
a nice toxic waste dump?

11:50.200 --> 11:51.952
Well, it is.

11:52.680 --> 11:55.319
I think I might have cracked
my pelvis.

11:55.520 --> 11:57.750
- Quit whining, Al.
- Hey, you.

11:57.960 --> 12:02.158
I kust survived Operation Dumbo Drop.
I don't wanna have no lip from you.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.949
Come on, Al. The women are depending
on us for emotional strength.

12:14.080 --> 12:17.709
It's coming, Marcy!
Do something, quick!

12:20.880 --> 12:22.359
What did you do that for?

12:22.560 --> 12:26.189
Well, Marcy did it
and she's the block captain.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.075
Well, she certainly
has the haircut for it.

12:29.760 --> 12:32.593
People, people, don't panic.
Everything will be fine...

12:32.800 --> 12:36.349
...if we kust all move into the basement
in an orderly fashion.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.751
Me! Me!

12:39.240 --> 12:41.435
Hey, hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.278
Now, aren't we forgetting
something?

12:43.480 --> 12:45.391
Wage-earners
before couch potatoes?

12:45.600 --> 12:47.909
No. I mean Lucky. Where is he?

12:48.120 --> 12:51.590
Same place we always put him
during bad weather. Outside.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.358
Come on, let's get in the basement.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.875
Well, I'm not going anywhere
until I get Lucky.

12:56.080 --> 12:59.117
Well, that should take
about 30 seconds.

13:02.720 --> 13:07.236
Kelly, you take this walkie-talkie
with you and call us if you need help.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.839
Okay. Oh, you know what?

13:09.040 --> 13:11.679
I better take this one,
kust in case this one breaks.

13:12.760 --> 13:16.389
Well, good luck and Godspeed. And
remember, we're all in this together.

13:17.480 --> 13:20.278
Hey! Let me in!

13:21.160 --> 13:22.752
I am your block captain.

13:22.960 --> 13:26.555
I am your leader.
You will die without me.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.878
I am in charge.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.799
You will die without a leader.

13:32.080 --> 13:35.197
Let me in.
I'm gonna break this door down.

13:35.400 --> 13:41.077
One, two, three!

13:53.680 --> 13:57.355
Attention. I hate you people.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.917
Yeah, well, imagine how I feel.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.678
We're in the middle
of something here.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.193
This is an emergency.

14:09.400 --> 14:12.597
Please put on your pants.
There's a twister coming.

14:13.240 --> 14:14.468
No, there isn't.

14:14.680 --> 14:18.389
I kust rigged up some hoses and fans
to trick Ariel into sleeping with me.

14:21.640 --> 14:25.110
Yes, Bud, but in the meantime,
a real storm blew in.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.390
So I went to all this trouble
for nothing?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.194
Bud, you're obscene.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.551
Who could possibly get turned on
in the face of disaster?

14:42.400 --> 14:45.119
Oh, I'm not turned on.
I kust need shelter.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.595
You could be a tree or a garage or-

14:47.800 --> 14:50.075
Or a laundry-folding wimp.

14:58.240 --> 15:03.268
Women, be brave. There is no reason
to lean on us or touch us in any way.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.672
For once, I agree with Al.

15:05.880 --> 15:10.908
As your civil defence block captain,
there will be no sex during the storm.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.554
No. No. No.

15:17.240 --> 15:20.357
Help us, Al! Do something.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.797
Don't do that. Not that way.

15:24.040 --> 15:27.157
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

15:46.360 --> 15:50.512
Well, I guess it's safe enough
to go upstairs now.

15:50.720 --> 15:54.349
But be careful.
There could be loose beams.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.719
Oh, damn door is kammed.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.356
Move aside, Marcy.
Let the men handle this. Jefferson?

16:07.160 --> 16:09.628
- Bud.
- All right, Dad.

16:11.800 --> 16:15.156
What? What? No, no! Wait! No!

16:19.320 --> 16:24.348
Damn door. Damn Bud's head.
Damn soft spot that never healed.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.636
Try it again.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.316
Al, put him down.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.954
All right. Get out of here.

16:36.440 --> 16:38.271
Furniture must be blocking the door.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.675
I hope my couch is okay.

16:40.880 --> 16:44.270
There must be another way
out of here.

16:45.440 --> 16:48.113
Hey, Al,
how about the secret way out?

16:50.920 --> 16:53.070
It's a secret.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.113
- Now, don't panic, Jefferson.
- You're right.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.470
After all,
Kelly knows we're down here.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.796
Right.
And as soon as she remembers...

17:02.040 --> 17:05.077
- Help! Help!
- Help! Help!

17:05.920 --> 17:09.878
Come on, Lucky. Come here, Lucky.
Please, stop. Come on, Lucky.

17:11.040 --> 17:15.511
That's weird. I can outrun a tornado,
but I can't catch the damn dog.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.951
Maybe I'll try chasing the tornado
for a while. Yeah, okay.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.152
Here, twister. Come on, twister.
Here, twister.

17:22.880 --> 17:26.873
Well, since we're stuck here,
we might as well play Mad Libs. Okay?

17:27.079 --> 17:28.148
I need a verb.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.153
Cluck.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.598
Okay.
Somebody give me a command.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.631
Cluck you?

17:38.320 --> 17:40.436
I like you.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.715
You know, perhaps Mad Libs is kust a
little too advanced for you people...

17:45.920 --> 17:49.833
...so let's kust play 20 questions,
okay? Who'll ask the first question?

17:50.040 --> 17:51.792
Go to hell.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.916
That's not a question.

17:55.680 --> 17:58.148
Why don't you go to hell?

18:00.880 --> 18:03.110
I really like you.

18:03.560 --> 18:08.509
Well, I'm good at games,
except I always lose at strip poker.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.679
Game time is over.

18:16.280 --> 18:19.158
Perhaps this would be a good time
to hand out the food.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.430
Okay. But supplies are limited.

18:21.640 --> 18:24.313
So we're gonna have
to pace ourselves.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.470
Good powdered turkey.

18:33.200 --> 18:36.158
Dad, you're supposed to dissolve it
in water first.

18:37.840 --> 18:41.071
Yeah, I thought the turkey
was a little dry this year.

18:41.960 --> 18:45.509
Peg, open up the powdered yams.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.152
Al, I can't believe you'd expect me
to cook at a time like this.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.799
Well, it's not over yet, folks.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.198
That tornado that hit Cook County is
expected to double back at force five.

18:57.400 --> 19:01.916
Force five? That's five times
stronger than the last one.

19:07.080 --> 19:10.390
Dear God, no.
I can't live through that again.

19:10.600 --> 19:15.993
Oh, the darkness, the cold,
the awful suction!

19:16.360 --> 19:19.318
- I'm not talking about the tornado, Al.
- Neither am I.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.557
Hey, Al, I know that we swore
on a stack of Big'Uns...

19:27.760 --> 19:30.797
...to keep the secret way out
a secret, but...

19:34.320 --> 19:38.757
You're right, Jefferson.
This is a matter of life or sex.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.949
- You got your key?
- Always.

19:46.760 --> 19:48.398
On my mark.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.558
Okay, Jefferson. Hurry up.

19:57.760 --> 20:01.070
You realize
we may never see our wives again.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.716
I know.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.398
- I think we made it, Jefferson.
- Yeah.

20:22.640 --> 20:25.313
We're in heaven.

20:41.080 --> 20:44.356
It's not fair.
The Cowardly Lion got courage...

20:44.600 --> 20:48.275
...the Tin Man got a heart,
and you got a brain.

20:48.760 --> 20:52.275
- What did the Wizard give you?
A physical.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.794
Hey, cut it out!
