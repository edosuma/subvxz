WEBVTT

00:04.193 --> 00:06.494
This is Oliver Crane
coming to you live

00:06.562 --> 00:08.696
from the Crescent City,
where, as promised,

00:08.765 --> 00:11.332
I'm meeting an anonymous source
who's gonna blow the lid off

00:11.400 --> 00:15.202
this sordid case of murder,
deception and conspiracy.

00:15.271 --> 00:17.505
Tonight I'm gonna shine a light
into the darkness.

00:17.573 --> 00:19.340
I'm going to expose
the criminals

00:19.408 --> 00:20.908
behind this
heinous killing spree,

00:20.977 --> 00:23.477
and you're gonna be there
while I do it.

00:23.546 --> 00:25.557
I'm gonna meet the one witness
who can confirm everything

00:25.581 --> 00:26.892
that local
law enforcement officials

00:26.916 --> 00:28.549
have repeatedly denied.

00:28.618 --> 00:30.985
Tonight, with her help,
everything's gonna change.

00:31.053 --> 00:32.052
Mr. Crane.

00:34.724 --> 00:36.657
Oh! Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, they shot her!

00:36.726 --> 00:38.103
They're-they're trying
to silence us.

00:38.127 --> 00:39.693
Oh, my God! If you get this...

00:39.762 --> 00:40.928
if you get this, send help!

00:40.997 --> 00:42.930
Send help right now.
No! Oh!

00:42.999 --> 00:43.133
Aah!

Mm-hmm.
Just needs more stuff.

We can go shopping
this weekend.

Okay, go brush.

01:54.537 --> 01:55.803
Liam.

01:57.373 --> 01:58.806
Come in.

01:58.875 --> 02:00.274
Uh, relax, Hannah.

02:00.343 --> 02:01.842
It's just a social call.

02:01.911 --> 02:03.477
I'm in New Orleans.

02:03.546 --> 02:06.413
Just wanted to
stop by and say hi.

02:06.482 --> 02:08.249
How'd you find me?
Uh,

02:08.317 --> 02:09.416
I'm a spy, you know?

02:09.485 --> 02:10.618
It's kind of my thing.

02:10.686 --> 02:12.987
Not calling
kind of your thing, too?

02:13.055 --> 02:15.289
Um, you're right.

02:15.358 --> 02:17.291
I'm sorry. Old habits.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.993
I was just eager to

02:19.061 --> 02:20.594
a friendly face.

02:20.663 --> 02:22.429
But clearly, you're
not happy to see me.

02:22.498 --> 02:24.131
No, I'm...

02:24.200 --> 02:27.468
I'm happy. I'm just,
I'm surprised, and...

02:27.536 --> 02:28.636
Liam!

02:28.704 --> 02:30.004
Princess!

02:30.072 --> 02:32.039
Look at you! Oh!

02:32.108 --> 02:33.707
Oh, you're all grown up.

02:33.776 --> 02:35.509
I can't believe it.

02:35.578 --> 02:37.327
Can I skip school
and hang out with you guys?

02:37.351 --> 02:38.613
No.

02:38.614 --> 02:41.148
You have a math test today,
and I have to go to work.

02:41.217 --> 02:42.683
I'll tell you what, Princess,

02:42.752 --> 02:44.785
you get an "A" on that test,
and I'll take you

02:44.854 --> 02:47.454
to Carousel Gardens for all
the junk food you can eat.

02:47.523 --> 02:49.657
It's just fractions.
Piece of cake.

02:49.725 --> 02:51.045
Ooh. We'll have
some of that, too.

02:51.427 --> 02:53.005
Okay, go get your backpack.
We got to go.

02:53.029 --> 02:55.296
Bye.

02:55.364 --> 02:57.131
Wow.
I know.

02:58.534 --> 03:00.301
I get it. I-I should go.

03:00.369 --> 03:01.735
Okay.
I'll text you.

03:01.804 --> 03:02.970
Okay.

03:05.608 --> 03:06.874
Liam?

03:08.044 --> 03:09.677
Everything okay?

03:09.745 --> 03:12.880
Yeah. Yeah.
Never better.

03:12.949 --> 03:14.014
Talk to you later.

03:14.083 --> 03:15.083
Okay.
Okay.

03:20.923 --> 03:21.877
Oh, my God!

03:21.901 --> 03:23.892
This was live-vlogged
last night at 11:08.

03:23.893 --> 03:24.618
Oh, my God, they shot her!

03:24.642 --> 03:26.328
Looks like Crane got
too close to a story,

03:26.329 --> 03:27.728
broadcast his own murder.

03:27.797 --> 03:29.196
Oliver Crane was
a journalist?

03:29.265 --> 03:31.165
That's a word for it.

03:31.233 --> 03:34.668
He preferred sound bites
and sensationalism over facts.

03:34.737 --> 03:36.570
Crane may have been
a handful, but...

03:38.007 --> 03:39.667
...his heart was
in the right place.

03:39.668 --> 03:42.109
Yeah, well, he did try to
ruin your career.

03:42.178 --> 03:43.566
Oh. And he did
get you arrested.

03:43.567 --> 03:46.347
But <i>then</i> he helped us take down
the men responsible.

03:46.415 --> 03:48.916
Which is why we're gonna
help find his killer.

03:48.985 --> 03:50.751
Isn't this NOPD's jurisdiction?

03:50.820 --> 03:52.419
I spoke to
the chief,

03:52.488 --> 03:54.421
explained our history
with Crane.

03:54.490 --> 03:59.293
NOPD'll run point but welcome
any help we can offer.

03:59.362 --> 04:00.894
First we need to
find Crane's body.

04:00.963 --> 04:02.196
Divers are searching
the river.

04:02.264 --> 04:05.032
CSU is working the crime scene.
No luck, no leads.

04:05.101 --> 04:06.633
Why don't you go
pick up Sebastian,

04:06.702 --> 04:08.413
head to the crime scene
so you can lend a hand?

04:08.437 --> 04:09.737
You got it, Hannah.

04:09.805 --> 04:12.373
What we do have is
the other victim at the scene:

04:12.441 --> 04:15.242
Assistant District Attorney
Lydia Davenport.

04:15.311 --> 04:16.877
I met her once.

04:16.946 --> 04:18.879
Smart prosecutor.

04:18.947 --> 04:20.748
Crane did say he
was gonna meet someone

04:20.815 --> 04:22.260
with information about
a murder investigation.

04:22.284 --> 04:23.762
Davenport could have
been sharing details

04:23.786 --> 04:25.119
on one of her cases.

04:25.187 --> 04:26.253
Let's find out which one.

04:26.322 --> 04:27.554
Contact the D.A.'s office.

04:27.623 --> 04:28.956
Check on any threats

04:29.025 --> 04:32.993
or issues related to Davenport's
most recent prosecutions.

04:33.062 --> 04:35.562
Crane claims he was
working on a huge story.

04:35.631 --> 04:38.165
We just don't know
what that story was.

04:38.234 --> 04:40.601
He teased his
vlog audience with it

04:40.669 --> 04:43.404
but didn't give
any significant details.

04:43.472 --> 04:44.805
Let's go to Crane's house.

04:44.874 --> 04:46.840
Any reporter worth their salt

04:46.909 --> 04:48.842
keeps notes on investigations.

04:56.218 --> 04:57.651
Everything okay?

04:57.720 --> 04:59.820
Yeah. I think so.

04:59.889 --> 05:03.991
I, um, had an unexpected
visitor this morning.

05:04.060 --> 05:05.993
Old colleague.
NCIS?

05:06.062 --> 05:09.329
CIA. We worked
together in Oman

05:09.398 --> 05:11.432
on my last
long-term assignment,

05:11.500 --> 05:14.101
taking down Victor Zelko.
The arms dealer?

05:14.170 --> 05:16.370
What'd this guy want?

05:16.439 --> 05:18.272
Absolutely nothing.

05:18.340 --> 05:19.673
Just saying hi.

05:19.742 --> 05:21.675
And he's not
the "saying hi" type?

05:21.744 --> 05:23.844
Liam lives in Delaware.

05:23.913 --> 05:25.879
He shows up in
New Orleans...

05:25.948 --> 05:27.848
at <i>my</i> door without calling.

05:27.917 --> 05:30.517
Doesn't say a word.

05:30.586 --> 05:32.052
Something's up.

05:39.428 --> 05:41.195
Door.

06:05.821 --> 06:08.021
Somebody searched this place.

06:09.825 --> 06:12.493
I'll have Sebastian head over
and dust the place for prints.

06:12.561 --> 06:14.027
Maybe just...

06:14.096 --> 06:16.029
dust the place in general.

06:16.098 --> 06:18.232
This loft hasn't been cleaned
in months.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.267
Crane was eccentric.

06:20.336 --> 06:23.103
Obsessed with his website,
BreakingNOLA.

06:23.172 --> 06:24.571
Nothing else
mattered.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.740
Final notice.

06:26.809 --> 06:29.076
He's past due on everything.

06:29.145 --> 06:31.578
Last time I was here,
this place was filled with...

06:31.647 --> 06:34.381
computers, servers,
people.

06:34.382 --> 06:36.683
Maybe the killer wanted
to get rid of the notes, too.

06:36.752 --> 06:39.286
You know, the team
made him out to be a hack, but...

06:39.355 --> 06:42.222
the Nexus is one of the highest
honors in journalism.

06:42.291 --> 06:44.224
This guy was
the real deal.

06:47.530 --> 06:49.530
Crane was a lot of things,

06:49.598 --> 06:52.266
but he never won
a journalism honor

06:52.334 --> 06:54.101
in his life.

07:06.315 --> 07:08.649
<i>It's a digital key.</i>
<i>It's encrypted</i>

07:08.717 --> 07:11.318
with the password to access
Crane's cloud drive.

07:11.387 --> 07:13.987
- Thousands of files.
- Any of them connect to his murder?

07:14.056 --> 07:15.923
Well, I started
with the file labeled:

07:15.991 --> 07:17.658
"In the event
of my untimely demise."

07:17.726 --> 07:19.459
Well, I would say
he's being dramatic,

07:19.528 --> 07:21.161
but in light
of current circumstances...

07:21.230 --> 07:23.063
He was prophetic.

07:23.132 --> 07:24.298
Let's see the video.

07:24.366 --> 07:25.599
If you are watching this,

07:25.668 --> 07:27.234
it means that I am dead.

07:27.303 --> 07:29.236
There is no time
to mourn my loss.

07:29.305 --> 07:31.305
In 2017,

07:31.373 --> 07:33.941
a local defense attorney
was killed during a carjacking.

07:34.009 --> 07:35.842
Police arrested an ex-con

07:35.911 --> 07:37.789
and former client
who had threatened the victim.

07:37.813 --> 07:39.112
This is spooky.

07:39.181 --> 07:40.981
It's like he's solving
his own murder

07:41.050 --> 07:42.115
from the grave.

07:42.184 --> 07:43.817
Then, six months ago,

07:43.886 --> 07:46.753
that same ex-con was killed
in the exact same location

07:46.822 --> 07:48.989
and in the exact same way
as the attorney.

07:49.058 --> 07:50.991
You might say coincidence.

07:51.060 --> 07:53.260
I say, connect the dots, people.

07:53.329 --> 07:54.969
This is just one example
of the conspiracy

07:54.997 --> 07:56.196
that I have uncovered.

07:56.265 --> 07:57.931
The cops
don't want you to know,

07:58.000 --> 07:59.299
but I keep pushing.

07:59.368 --> 08:02.336
Or I <i>did,</i> because now I'm dead.

08:02.404 --> 08:05.372
You know, Crane goes on
to talk about two other cases.

08:05.441 --> 08:06.918
The suspects were
released by the cops.

08:06.942 --> 08:08.642
Then they were killed
in the same manner

08:08.711 --> 08:10.844
as their alleged murders.
Crane's suggesting

08:10.913 --> 08:13.180
law enforcement was involved
in these vigilante murders?

08:13.249 --> 08:15.782
- Convinced of it.
- Well, crime scene was a bust.

08:15.851 --> 08:17.618
No trace, no shell casings.

08:17.686 --> 08:19.553
Suspect even went so far
as to dig the slugs

08:19.622 --> 08:21.233
out of the concrete.
We're looking for someone

08:21.257 --> 08:22.657
with advanced training
and knowledge

08:22.691 --> 08:23.716
of forensic protocols.

08:23.717 --> 08:25.950
Possibly a cop,
like Crane was theorizing.

08:26.733 --> 08:28.199
Any sign of Crane's body?

08:28.268 --> 08:30.802
No, not yet.
We can't find his phone, either.

08:30.870 --> 08:32.715
Lasalle's sticking around
just in case, but, I mean,

08:32.739 --> 08:34.216
you know how strong
those currents can be.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.807
He'd be 50 miles downriver
by now.

08:35.875 --> 08:37.642
That means we
got nothing to go on.

08:37.710 --> 08:39.020
But we're not the
only one looking.

08:39.044 --> 08:41.879
Someone just accessed
Crane's cloud drive.

08:41.948 --> 08:44.682
- Can you identify the user I.D.?
- No, but their terminal's

08:44.751 --> 08:46.417
being used in the
Mercer Library.

08:46.486 --> 08:47.518
The library's closed.

08:47.587 --> 08:48.886
Yeah. Let's go.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.534
The connection to
Crane's cloud is still active.

09:03.603 --> 09:05.536
Computers are just ahead.

09:05.605 --> 09:07.505
Stay on comms.

09:29.496 --> 09:31.028
NCIS!

09:31.097 --> 09:32.274
Aah! Wait! Wait! Don't shoot!

09:32.298 --> 09:33.064
Okay, okay.

09:33.132 --> 09:35.566
Okay.

09:36.669 --> 09:37.902
Oh.

09:37.971 --> 09:39.036
Crane.

09:39.105 --> 09:40.204
Hey, Dwayne.

09:41.541 --> 09:43.241
You're looking pretty good
for a dead man.

09:53.772 --> 09:55.672
So, let me get this straight.

09:55.741 --> 09:58.808
You threw yourself
in the Mississippi River

09:58.877 --> 10:00.343
to play dead?

10:00.412 --> 10:01.778
Lydia Davenport
had just been shot

10:01.847 --> 10:03.813
right in front of me,
and I thought I was next.

10:03.882 --> 10:05.927
And you're actually, you're not
out of the woods yet, either,

10:05.951 --> 10:07.395
'cause the Mississippi's
pretty toxic.

10:07.419 --> 10:09.339
You could have a flesh-eating
bacterial infection

10:09.388 --> 10:10.854
and, like,
not even know it.

10:10.922 --> 10:12.389
Did you get a look
at the suspect?

10:12.457 --> 10:14.224
I don't know, dodging bullets

10:14.293 --> 10:16.359
sort of took up
all my concentration.

10:16.428 --> 10:18.006
Who else knew you were
meeting with A.D.A. Davenport?

10:18.030 --> 10:20.196
No one. I always
protect my sources.

10:20.265 --> 10:22.532
All evidence to the contrary.

10:22.601 --> 10:25.702
So Davenport was assigned
to one of the murder cases

10:25.771 --> 10:27.170
that you were
investigating?

10:27.239 --> 10:29.239
Well, she was <i>involved</i>
in one of the cases.

10:29.308 --> 10:31.119
- Her boyfriend was the victim.
- The lawyer killed

10:31.143 --> 10:33.310
in the carjacking?
Yeah. When I found out

10:33.378 --> 10:34.978
they dated,
I requested an interview.

10:35.047 --> 10:37.580
She told me to go to hell
the first nine times.

10:37.649 --> 10:38.982
Yeah, I bet you get that a lot.

10:39.051 --> 10:40.750
Yeah. But ten is
my lucky number.

10:40.819 --> 10:42.686
And exposing the truth
is my motto.

10:42.754 --> 10:43.853
Focus, Crane.

10:43.922 --> 10:45.400
If you had evidence
of a vigilante,

10:45.424 --> 10:47.157
why didn't you go to the police?
- I did.

10:47.225 --> 10:48.569
They weren't
particularly concerned

10:48.593 --> 10:50.760
with the deaths
of some scumbag ex-cons

10:50.829 --> 10:52.395
who probably got
what they deserved.

10:52.464 --> 10:54.431
It's a direct quote, by the way.

10:54.499 --> 10:55.859
Any idea
what information Davenport

10:55.901 --> 10:57.334
was about to share
with you?

10:57.402 --> 10:58.980
No. All she said on the phone
was that she had

10:59.004 --> 11:00.415
a new murder case
for me to look into.

11:00.439 --> 11:01.504
I never found out what.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.873
I might have that answer.

11:03.942 --> 11:05.653
I looked into A.D.A. Davenport's
recent activities.

11:05.677 --> 11:08.511
She spoke to a detective
in Baton Rouge regarding

11:08.580 --> 11:10.380
an investigation that matches
Crane's pattern.

11:10.449 --> 11:13.583
Ooh, another accused killer who
was acquitted and then murdered?

11:13.652 --> 11:16.052
Well, this victim wasn't charged
with a crime,

11:16.121 --> 11:18.555
he was a person of interest
in a robbery gone wrong.

11:18.623 --> 11:21.591
Suggests our killer has access
to internal police files.

11:21.660 --> 11:23.504
Yeah, and it supports the theory
that the vigilante's

11:23.528 --> 11:24.528
former law enforcement.

11:24.596 --> 11:25.729
Or still on the job.

11:25.797 --> 11:27.130
Or all of the above.

11:27.199 --> 11:29.232
Because I believe
this is a conspiracy.

11:29.301 --> 11:31.234
Any evidence?
Just history.

11:31.303 --> 11:32.780
It wouldn't be the first time
some cops tried

11:32.804 --> 11:34.637
to fix a broken system
by crossing the line.

11:34.706 --> 11:37.307
That's <i>Magnum Force,</i>
that's <i>The Star Chamber.</i>

11:37.376 --> 11:39.876
Those are movies.
Yeah, and no evidence.

11:39.945 --> 11:42.979
Multiple jurisdictions, multiple
victims, multiple M.O.s.

11:43.048 --> 11:45.126
- Open your eyes, people.
- We need to do a deep dive.

11:45.150 --> 11:46.649
Cross-reference all these cases.

11:46.718 --> 11:48.238
Find the common threads,
intersections.

11:48.286 --> 11:50.320
- You mean do actual police work.
- Yeah.

11:50.389 --> 11:53.590
I'll get with Patton
and we'll get to it.

11:53.658 --> 11:56.726
Loop Loretta in.

11:56.795 --> 11:58.161
Have her review
the case files.

11:58.230 --> 11:59.429
See what she can find.
Sure.

11:59.498 --> 12:01.331
What's up?

12:01.400 --> 12:02.766
Um, it's your brother.

12:02.834 --> 12:05.168
Just texted. You know
that friend I told you about?

12:05.237 --> 12:06.970
He's at the Trutone,
he's causing trouble.

12:07.038 --> 12:09.839
Can you, um,
hold down the fort?

12:09.908 --> 12:11.841
Sure.

12:13.311 --> 12:15.178
This is exciting, right?

12:15.247 --> 12:16.813
We got the whole
band back together.

12:16.882 --> 12:18.014
What can I do?

12:18.083 --> 12:19.816
Roll over and play dead.

12:19.885 --> 12:21.985
What? No.
That's a terrible idea.

12:22.053 --> 12:23.486
She's right.
As long as

12:23.555 --> 12:25.021
the suspect thinks
that you're dead,

12:25.090 --> 12:26.489
he won't try to kill you again.

12:26.558 --> 12:28.291
Okay, when you explain it
like that,

12:28.360 --> 12:30.326
- I actually sort of love that plan.
- Mm-hmm.

12:30.395 --> 12:33.630
That's good. So... whose house
am I sleeping at tonight?

12:37.569 --> 12:39.769
<i>Trust me, my friend.</i>

12:39.838 --> 12:41.304
<i>You do not want</i>
<i>to mess with me.</i>

12:41.373 --> 12:43.840
You got no argument here,
my man.

12:43.909 --> 12:45.251
I could break your
neck with my thumb.

12:45.275 --> 12:46.577
Okay, color me impressed,

12:46.578 --> 12:48.589
but add that to the list
of reasons why you're cut off.

12:48.613 --> 12:51.481
You know...
I can't tell you who I am,

12:51.550 --> 12:52.216
- Okay.
- but if you knew...

12:52.240 --> 12:53.384
Hey, Liam.

12:53.385 --> 12:55.618
- If you knew...
- No one cares who you are.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.153
Why don't you go sit down?

12:57.222 --> 12:59.355
Because I'm trying
to get drunk.

12:59.424 --> 13:00.535
Yeah, well,
mission accomplished.

13:00.559 --> 13:01.691
Go. Sit.

13:01.760 --> 13:04.794
Okay. I'm sitting.

13:05.797 --> 13:07.564
Can I have two coffees?

13:07.632 --> 13:08.865
Please.

13:08.934 --> 13:10.400
I am so sorry, Jimmy.

13:10.469 --> 13:12.469
Thanks for reaching out.

13:12.537 --> 13:13.562
We were getting along like
gangbusters two drinks ago.

13:13.586 --> 13:14.271
Yeah.

13:14.272 --> 13:15.805
Then Dr. Jekyll
became Mr. Hyde.

13:15.874 --> 13:18.241
Brown or clear?

13:18.310 --> 13:20.043
Whiskey or gin?
I just want to know

13:20.111 --> 13:21.578
what Hyde I'm dealing with.

13:21.646 --> 13:23.413
Whiskey.

13:23.482 --> 13:27.183
That means hostile
but just so sloppy.

13:27.252 --> 13:30.553
Guess you've been through
this before with him.

13:30.622 --> 13:32.689
More than once.

13:37.128 --> 13:38.528
Three years sober.

13:38.597 --> 13:41.731
You worked hard for that.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.433
Sobriety's for
quitters, right?

13:43.502 --> 13:45.835
Is that what you're doing
in New Orleans?

13:45.904 --> 13:47.837
Jumping off the wagon,
come over here

13:47.906 --> 13:49.405
to embarrass me
at my boss's bar?

13:49.474 --> 13:52.876
Yeah, that's exactly
why I'm here.

13:52.944 --> 13:54.911
You got something to say,
you can say it, Liam.

13:54.980 --> 13:58.848
The raid on Victor Zelko--

13:58.917 --> 14:01.751
the crown jewel of both
our careers--

14:01.820 --> 14:04.053
wasn't quite as surgical
as we thought.

14:04.122 --> 14:06.890
No, that was as clean an
operation as they come.

14:06.958 --> 14:10.460
Special ops killed Zelko and
two bodyguards at his compound.

14:10.529 --> 14:13.196
That's the official story,
Hannah.

14:13.265 --> 14:15.899
The truth is far messier.

14:15.967 --> 14:17.934
Victor's family was there, too.

14:18.003 --> 14:21.371
No. No, they were in Istanbul.

14:21.439 --> 14:23.139
I heard it from...
Our Intel confir...

14:23.208 --> 14:25.308
I heard it
from the horse's mouth...

14:25.377 --> 14:27.076
the commander who led the raid.

14:28.213 --> 14:32.215
Zelko, his wife...

14:32.284 --> 14:35.785
and his 15-year-old son...
were all there.

14:37.489 --> 14:39.389
And all killed.

14:39.457 --> 14:42.091
And our bosses covered it up.

14:45.330 --> 14:47.330
You're so good, Hannah.

14:47.399 --> 14:49.065
You're so even-keeled.

14:49.134 --> 14:50.344
I can't tell if you're
actually surprised

14:50.368 --> 14:51.768
or you really didn't know.

14:51.836 --> 14:53.336
Of course I didn't know.

14:55.206 --> 14:57.440
Our Intel confirmed...

14:57.509 --> 14:58.984
Your Intel. Your source.

14:59.008 --> 15:00.210
Are you trying to accuse me
of something here?

15:00.211 --> 15:01.644
I'm saying we should
have waited.

15:01.713 --> 15:03.947
We waited over a year
to find Zelko.

15:04.015 --> 15:05.648
He tried to kill my family.

15:05.717 --> 15:09.085
Everyone on our team signed off
on that raid.

15:09.154 --> 15:10.987
And two innocent people died
because of it.

15:11.056 --> 15:12.233
Thousands of people died
because of the weapons

15:12.257 --> 15:13.489
that Zelko was selling.

15:13.558 --> 15:15.091
It doesn't make
what we did right.

15:17.762 --> 15:20.163
We did what we had to do, Liam,

15:20.231 --> 15:22.966
with the best information
that we had available.

15:25.270 --> 15:28.605
Well, I'm drinkin'.

15:28.673 --> 15:31.507
And you're rationalizing.

15:31.576 --> 15:33.009
Which is the worse sin?

15:38.383 --> 15:40.216
<i>Q-Anon?</i>

15:40.285 --> 15:41.767
Q-Anon's like a-a right-wing
marketing gimmick.

15:41.791 --> 15:42.853
Now it is.

15:42.854 --> 15:44.454
All I'm saying
is that doesn't

15:44.522 --> 15:46.856
necessarily mean
that he wasn't real.

15:46.925 --> 15:48.569
- Oh, man, Pizzagate, all right?
- Yeah, Pizzagate.

15:48.593 --> 15:50.727
Seriously?

15:50.795 --> 15:53.329
Were you guys up all night
talking nerd?

15:53.398 --> 15:54.942
Well, I mean, he thinks
that Q's posts were legit,

15:54.966 --> 15:56.299
and I'm saying
they're propaganda,

15:56.368 --> 15:59.168
but he wants...
First of all, shut it up.

15:59.237 --> 16:01.504
Secondly, one of you mentions
Area 51 or a grassy knoll

16:01.573 --> 16:04.374
before I finish my coffee...
you're gonna get punched.

16:04.442 --> 16:07.477
Is she always this
much of a grump in the morning?

16:07.545 --> 16:09.178
You wanna see a grump?

16:09.247 --> 16:10.358
Hey, hey, hey. L-Listen,
hold on, hold on.

16:10.382 --> 16:11.848
Hold on. Listen.

16:11.916 --> 16:12.916
While you were sleeping,

16:12.984 --> 16:14.350
Crane and I may have
figured out

16:14.419 --> 16:16.099
how the suspect's been
picking his victims.

16:16.154 --> 16:19.922
Look, all four names
appeared on this website.

16:19.991 --> 16:21.991
What's The Murder Index?

16:22.060 --> 16:24.027
It's actually,
it's kind of brilliant.

16:24.095 --> 16:26.029
I mean, it's obviously,

16:26.097 --> 16:27.430
it's awful, too.

16:27.499 --> 16:29.198
Explain.
Somebody created

16:29.267 --> 16:31.334
a "murder algorithm."
It predicts the likelihood

16:31.403 --> 16:33.870
that a suspected killer
actually committed a crime.

16:33.938 --> 16:36.272
Based on what?
Stats and figures gleaned

16:36.341 --> 16:38.241
from FBI and police databases.

16:38.309 --> 16:40.710
They take the data,
they plug it into a program

16:40.779 --> 16:42.779
and then the program assigns
every suspect a score.

16:42.847 --> 16:44.113
Yeah, the creator of this site

16:44.182 --> 16:46.182
is like the Bill James
of crime stats.

16:46.251 --> 16:47.795
Yeah, well, random numbers
don't prove anything,

16:47.819 --> 16:49.752
but false accusations
can ruin someone's life.

16:49.821 --> 16:51.287
Yeah, or even get them killed.

16:51.356 --> 16:53.856
All right. We got to find
this murder algorithm idiot.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.503
Well, that's done and done.
Patton already hacked

16:55.527 --> 16:58.027
the IP address, got a name.

16:58.096 --> 17:01.264
Steve Betros. Runs an online
marketing firm in town.

17:01.332 --> 17:02.812
That was also
while you were sleeping.

17:04.135 --> 17:05.601
Look, Pride and Hannah

17:05.670 --> 17:08.538
are on their way to talk
to Betros right now.

17:08.606 --> 17:10.518
It also looks like Wade found
something in the forensic files,

17:10.541 --> 17:12.709
so I'll head over to the
morgue, see what's up.

17:12.777 --> 17:14.444
All right.

17:14.512 --> 17:16.579
Well, looks like it's
just you and me, kid.

17:16.647 --> 17:17.780
Uh-uh. Nope.

17:17.848 --> 17:19.482
You're gonna
take him with you,

17:19.550 --> 17:21.250
or somebody in this house
is gonna die.

17:21.319 --> 17:23.252
Geez.

17:24.789 --> 17:27.089
- I'm gonna be in the car.
- Yeah.

17:27.157 --> 17:30.993
Betros Data Solutions is a
leader in digital marketing.

17:31.062 --> 17:33.062
We mine social media
and other sites

17:33.131 --> 17:35.932
to target our clients'
online marketing needs.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.511
By using websites
with incessant pop-ups

17:37.535 --> 17:38.801
and aggressive advertising?

17:38.870 --> 17:42.739
Guilty as charged,
but... it's a living.

17:42.807 --> 17:45.074
We're not here to talk
about online marketing.

17:45.143 --> 17:48.811
We want to know
about your Murder Index.

17:48.880 --> 17:51.481
That's more of a pastime
than anything else.

17:51.549 --> 17:54.817
I wouldn't call laying odds on
prospective killers a pastime.

17:54.886 --> 17:56.519
it dangerous.

17:56.588 --> 17:58.454
I'd call it a public service,

17:58.523 --> 18:00.323
and there's nothing
unlawful about it.

18:00.391 --> 18:02.024
Well, there is

18:02.093 --> 18:03.760
if you're using
illegally mined records

18:03.828 --> 18:05.495
from law enforcement databases.

18:05.563 --> 18:07.997
- Is that an accusation?
- More of a theory.

18:08.066 --> 18:09.665
Based on what we've seen
on the Index.

18:09.734 --> 18:11.467
My site doesn't state
anyone's guilty.

18:11.536 --> 18:15.171
It just interprets the data
and predicts an outcome.

18:15.240 --> 18:16.873
That's a job
for the justice system.

18:16.941 --> 18:18.185
Well, if that were true,
then my nieces

18:18.209 --> 18:19.386
would still have their mother.

18:19.410 --> 18:21.844
My sister was, uh,

18:21.913 --> 18:26.616
beaten to death three years ago
in her own living room.

18:26.684 --> 18:31.454
And the cops...
they knew who did it.

18:31.523 --> 18:33.689
His name was Ed Lang.

18:33.758 --> 18:37.460
And he walked because of
an illegal search conducted

18:37.529 --> 18:39.228
by a rookie officer.

18:39.297 --> 18:41.397
The system isn't perfect.

18:41.466 --> 18:42.498
The system is a joke.

18:42.567 --> 18:44.333
Ed Lang. I know that name.

18:44.402 --> 18:46.302
He was a victim in one
of the murder cases

18:46.371 --> 18:47.737
that Crane researched.

18:47.806 --> 18:52.008
Murdered in his living room
about six months back.

18:52.076 --> 18:53.576
You gonna accuse me
of that, too?

18:53.645 --> 18:56.646
You have a strong motive,
Mr. Betros.

18:56.714 --> 18:57.814
An even stronger alibi.

18:57.882 --> 18:59.248
I mean, you
guys can check

18:59.317 --> 19:00.728
with the NOPD detectives
who grilled me

19:00.752 --> 19:02.018
for six hours straight.

19:02.086 --> 19:03.419
That doesn't sound
like a denial.

19:03.488 --> 19:05.588
Okay.

19:05.657 --> 19:08.391
Then let me be clear.

19:08.459 --> 19:10.593
I didn't kill Ed Lang.

19:10.662 --> 19:12.895
But I haven't lost a moment's
sleep since he died.

19:12.964 --> 19:15.331
You may not have pulled
any triggers,

19:15.400 --> 19:18.534
but you have wittingly
put a crosshair

19:18.603 --> 19:20.336
on every name on your website.

19:20.405 --> 19:22.905
Yeah, I don't lose sleep
over that, either.

19:22.974 --> 19:25.374
Because out of the three of us
in this room,

19:25.443 --> 19:28.744
I'm the only one trying
to make this city a safer place.

19:31.015 --> 19:34.050
I'll call the D.A.,
have an injunction filed

19:34.118 --> 19:35.518
to shut the
Murder Index down.

19:35.587 --> 19:38.187
Yeah. Let's confirm
Betros's alibi

19:38.256 --> 19:40.389
for Ed Lang's murder.

19:40.458 --> 19:43.526
He checks every box
for a revenge killing.

19:43.595 --> 19:45.428
It's hard to blame him.

19:45.496 --> 19:47.196
I'm-I'm not saying
that it's okay,

19:47.265 --> 19:49.565
just, he was trying
to right a wrong.

19:49.634 --> 19:51.133
It's still
vigilante justice.

19:51.202 --> 19:54.971
It's... complicated,
that's all.

19:57.308 --> 19:59.475
I'll get cracking
on that alibi.

20:03.982 --> 20:06.816
We are currently walking the
halls of the JPSO Morgue,

20:06.885 --> 20:09.785
sanctum sanctorum
of Dr. Loretta Wade.

20:09.854 --> 20:12.922
I reviewed the forensic
and autopsy files

20:12.991 --> 20:14.257
on both the original victims

20:14.325 --> 20:16.893
and the suspects accused
of killing them.

20:16.961 --> 20:18.606
I'm hoping you found a
connection to our vigilante.

20:18.630 --> 20:20.596
Dr. Wade is a crackerjack
medical examiner

20:20.665 --> 20:22.632
and one of the best
pathologists in the South.

20:22.700 --> 20:24.600
What I found was that
the vigilante killed

20:24.669 --> 20:28.004
at least one
wrongly accused man.

20:28.072 --> 20:30.506
We are gonna blow the lid off
this vigilante case.

20:30.575 --> 20:33.476
You are not gonna blow the lid
off anything.

20:33.544 --> 20:34.688
Freedom of the press is
a cornerstone

20:34.712 --> 20:35.945
of democracy, Dr. Wade.

20:36.014 --> 20:38.147
My morgue is not a democracy.

20:38.216 --> 20:39.982
Right. But if it
wasn't for me,

20:40.051 --> 20:41.891
you wouldn't even really
have this case, right?

20:41.920 --> 20:43.920
So you kind of owe me
the exclusive.

20:43.988 --> 20:45.855
I don't owe you anything,
Mr. Crane.

20:45.924 --> 20:47.623
Now, if you will stay
in the hallway,

20:47.692 --> 20:51.694
Sebastian and I will continue
our consultation alone.

20:51.763 --> 20:53.829
This is blatant censorship.

20:53.898 --> 20:56.599
Call a cop.

20:56.668 --> 20:58.200
Can I...?
Uh, uh...

21:02.740 --> 21:05.441
This is Dr. Arthur Wyndham.

21:05.510 --> 21:09.145
He was found in an alley with
his throat cut last year.

21:09.213 --> 21:12.515
NOPD suspected a drug addict
named Charlie Reese.

21:12.583 --> 21:14.428
Right. But before they
were able to build a case,

21:14.452 --> 21:16.263
he was found with his own
throat cut in the same alley.

21:16.287 --> 21:19.055
Yeah. It was tragic, considering
Reese was completely innocent.

21:19.123 --> 21:20.523
Well, how do you know?

21:20.591 --> 21:23.025
Oh, I would've ruled him out
by weight and height alone.

21:23.094 --> 21:26.162
Dr. Wyndham had
four inches on him,

21:26.230 --> 21:28.631
and Reese suffered from
myasthenia gravis,

21:28.700 --> 21:30.700
severely weakens
the skeletal muscles.

21:30.768 --> 21:32.246
So there's no way he would
have had the strength

21:32.270 --> 21:35.171
or the motor skills
to inflict such lethal damage.

21:35.239 --> 21:36.639
Wait.
Charlie Reese was innocent?

21:39.277 --> 21:41.711
I was convinced that he killed
Dr. Wyndham.

21:41.779 --> 21:43.879
I did a two-part vlog about it.

21:43.948 --> 21:46.882
Police incompetence and
the mishandling of justice.

21:46.951 --> 21:48.584
It's what led me

21:48.653 --> 21:52.021
to this vigilante story
in the first place.

21:52.090 --> 21:54.223
Man, I hate when I'm wrong.

21:54.292 --> 21:56.859
Imagine you'd grown used to it
by now.

21:56.928 --> 22:00.596
If I agree with you,
can I please stay in here?

22:00.665 --> 22:02.932
Yes. Don't touch
anything. No camera.

22:03.001 --> 22:04.700
Okay.

22:04.769 --> 22:08.170
Okay, so, Reese was executed
by a vigilante

22:08.239 --> 22:09.872
for a crime
that he never committed?

22:09.941 --> 22:11.774
Yeah, but not necessarily
the same vigilante

22:11.843 --> 22:13.209
for the other three cases.

22:13.277 --> 22:14.577
Wait, so you agree

22:14.645 --> 22:17.279
that there's at least two
of them out there, right?

22:17.348 --> 22:19.882
We could be looking
at as many as four.

22:19.951 --> 22:21.851
This is exactly what
I've been saying.

22:21.919 --> 22:23.586
Right? We have

22:23.654 --> 22:26.088
a bona fide conspiracy
on our hands here.

22:26.157 --> 22:29.058
Oh, my God, I'm gonna win
a Pulitzer for this.

22:29.127 --> 22:31.060
God have mercy on us all.

22:38.933 --> 22:41.100
All right. These are
the original murder victims

22:41.169 --> 22:42.535
that Crane was investigating.

22:42.604 --> 22:44.115
All of them
from different walks of life,

22:44.139 --> 22:45.483
all of them
from different jurisdictions.

22:45.507 --> 22:47.040
That's James Ferrington, Jr.

22:47.108 --> 22:49.575
Sophomore at LSU killed
in a robbery gone wrong.

22:49.644 --> 22:51.477
That's what A.D.A.
Davenport wanted to share

22:51.546 --> 22:53.146
with Crane before
she was killed.

22:53.214 --> 22:54.981
Yeah. Now, over here
are the four men

22:55.050 --> 22:56.616
suspected of killing them.

22:56.685 --> 22:58.284
They themselves were murdered

22:58.353 --> 23:00.987
by vigilantes
in nearly identical ways.

23:01.056 --> 23:04.157
All four of these dead suspects
were listed on the Murder Index

23:04.225 --> 23:06.225
created by Steve Betros.

23:06.294 --> 23:08.895
Yeah. His sister
was killed by an Ed Lang,

23:08.963 --> 23:11.297
and then Lang was killed
in the exact same way.

23:11.366 --> 23:12.665
But Steve Betros

23:12.734 --> 23:15.001
has a rock-solid alibi
for the Lang murder.

23:15.070 --> 23:19.572
Right. But what if somebody else
killed Lang on Betros's behalf,

23:19.641 --> 23:20.641
and then in return,

23:20.709 --> 23:22.608
Betros killed one
of our other suspects.

23:22.677 --> 23:24.273
Well, that's the plot
for <i>Strangers on a Train.</i>

23:24.297 --> 23:24.978
Yeah, exactly.

23:24.979 --> 23:26.946
Our vigilantes
are exchanging murders

23:27.015 --> 23:28.147
to avoid suspicion.

23:28.216 --> 23:29.515
Okay. Interesting theory.

23:29.584 --> 23:30.750
It was Crane's idea.

23:30.819 --> 23:32.339
One of his
less annoying contributions.

23:32.387 --> 23:34.287
Okay, but who else is involved,

23:34.356 --> 23:35.966
and how do all these people
know each other?

23:35.990 --> 23:37.457
Victims United.

23:37.525 --> 23:41.327
Support group for survivors
of violent crimes.

23:41.396 --> 23:43.429
Davenport and Steve Betros
were members.

23:43.498 --> 23:44.997
The founder...

23:45.066 --> 23:47.800
is a man named
James Ferrington, Sr.

23:47.869 --> 23:49.769
Father of the murdered
LSU student.

23:49.838 --> 23:52.705
Ex-state police detective
who quit after his son's death.

23:52.774 --> 23:54.719
Former cop, access to law
enforcement databases.

23:54.743 --> 23:56.809
That makes Victims United

23:56.878 --> 23:58.811
ground zero.

23:59.881 --> 24:02.715
<i>He was our baby!</i>

24:02.784 --> 24:04.884
And you killed him, you monster!

24:04.953 --> 24:06.686
You have to purge that anger.

24:07.789 --> 24:09.322
Embrace it.

24:09.391 --> 24:11.491
Use it.

24:11.559 --> 24:14.961
If you're living with fear,

24:15.029 --> 24:17.697
if you're holding on to pain...

24:17.766 --> 24:19.399
you're just another victim.

24:20.802 --> 24:22.402
And victims get no respect.

24:25.039 --> 24:26.706
Just ask our guests
from law enforcement.

24:26.775 --> 24:28.641
They'll tell you.

24:28.710 --> 24:31.744
Sorry to interrupt.
We need to speak with you

24:31.813 --> 24:33.746
and, uh, Mr. Betros, please.

24:33.815 --> 24:35.715
Go right ahead.

24:35.784 --> 24:37.717
This is an open forum.

24:37.786 --> 24:39.552
It's a sensitive matter.

24:39.621 --> 24:42.021
Are you here to arrest us?

24:42.090 --> 24:43.389
No, sir. Just to talk.

24:43.458 --> 24:44.490
Then go ahead and talk.

24:48.062 --> 24:50.997
We're investigating
a string of murders.

24:52.434 --> 24:54.367
All connected to this group.

24:54.436 --> 24:56.736
Since you're a former
cop, we were hoping

24:56.805 --> 24:58.538
for cooperation
and understanding.

24:58.606 --> 25:00.506
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint.

25:00.575 --> 25:03.609
But, see, there's a reason
why I'm a former cop.

25:03.678 --> 25:06.579
See, the system you serve
doesn't serve the victims.

25:06.648 --> 25:09.115
Innocent people die,
and the guilty

25:09.184 --> 25:10.661
escape the punishment
that they deserve.

25:10.685 --> 25:12.952
Charlie Reese
get what he deserved?

25:13.021 --> 25:16.456
He murdered a doctor while
trying to steal money for drugs.

25:16.524 --> 25:18.291
No, he didn't. He was innocent.

25:18.359 --> 25:19.926
Your website got him killed.

25:19.994 --> 25:22.395
That's crap.
I ran the data.

25:22.464 --> 25:24.630
It's irrefutable.
Steve, stop talking.

25:24.699 --> 25:27.200
No. We need to continue
this conversation,

25:27.268 --> 25:28.634
but in private.

25:28.703 --> 25:30.436
There's nothing left to say.

25:30.505 --> 25:32.205
If you have any more questions,

25:32.273 --> 25:33.517
you can ask them
through our lawyers.

25:33.541 --> 25:35.808
Thought you said
this was an open forum.

25:35.877 --> 25:38.277
It's just been closed.

25:38.346 --> 25:40.980
Let's take five. Grab a coffee.

25:41.049 --> 25:42.982
Some cake.

25:44.686 --> 25:46.219
Let's go, Christopher.

25:50.024 --> 25:51.390
What are we doing?

25:51.459 --> 25:52.870
We could take both
of them in right now.

25:52.894 --> 25:54.494
Betros, he's dying to talk.

25:54.562 --> 25:55.962
Let's just
keep an eye on them.

25:56.030 --> 25:57.997
See what they do next.

26:00.335 --> 26:02.435
NOPD should be ashamed

26:02.504 --> 26:04.624
for letting a cold-blooded
killer back on the streets.

26:04.672 --> 26:07.625
Charlie Reese is a predator,
plain and simple.

26:07.626 --> 26:08.953
Is that your report
on Charlie Reese?

26:10.144 --> 26:12.311
Yeah, I was convinced this was

26:12.380 --> 26:15.314
some terrible miscarriage
of justice. You know?

26:15.383 --> 26:16.682
Cops sleeping on the job.

26:16.751 --> 26:18.251
You made a mistake.

26:18.319 --> 26:20.531
Yeah, a mistake I can live with.
I make them on the regular.

26:20.555 --> 26:22.154
But no, this...

26:22.223 --> 26:25.324
I tracked this guy down
to his halfway house.

26:25.393 --> 26:26.926
I harassed him with questions.

26:26.995 --> 26:28.961
I vilified him,
and I got him killed.

26:29.030 --> 26:30.329
All right, all right. Relax.

26:30.398 --> 26:33.032
Maybe you're being
too hard on yourself.

26:33.101 --> 26:34.333
Oh.

26:34.402 --> 26:35.935
You being nice
just makes it worse.

26:36.004 --> 26:37.270
That's just pity.

26:37.338 --> 26:39.772
No, I'm not nice. I
don't even like you.

26:39.841 --> 26:42.108
I think that you're shifty
and actually annoying.

26:42.176 --> 26:44.677
Oh. Okay. Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

26:44.746 --> 26:46.879
But I don't pity you.

26:46.948 --> 26:48.548
And as much as it
pains me to say this,

26:48.616 --> 26:50.449
I kind of respect you
for working so hard

26:50.518 --> 26:51.684
to try to get the truth.

26:52.787 --> 26:54.720
You respect me?

26:54.789 --> 26:56.522
<i>Kind of.</i> Don't make this weird.

26:56.591 --> 26:58.291
Okay.
And drop the "poor me" crap

26:58.359 --> 27:00.839
and come in the other room and
help us solve this case already.

27:00.895 --> 27:03.229
Okay. Yeah. Let's go, partner.

27:07.802 --> 27:09.201
Come on.

27:12.974 --> 27:16.976
I don't think embracing
your anger really helps.

27:17.045 --> 27:18.411
Well, I think

27:18.479 --> 27:20.146
survivors are looking
for anything

27:20.214 --> 27:21.981
to guide them through the pain.

27:22.050 --> 27:23.849
In this case,
they took it too far.

27:23.918 --> 27:25.217
Yeah.

27:26.554 --> 27:28.988
Got eyes on Betros.

27:31.626 --> 27:33.359
Oh.

27:33.428 --> 27:34.994
Dude doesn't look too happy.

27:42.136 --> 27:43.769
Let's see where they go.

27:44.906 --> 27:46.906
All right.

27:53.648 --> 27:55.181
Hey, Jimmy.

27:56.684 --> 27:58.451
How's he doing tonight?

27:58.519 --> 28:00.186
A regular Boy Scout.

28:00.254 --> 28:01.921
Maybe it's 'cause
he ordered gin.

28:01.990 --> 28:03.222
Great.

28:03.291 --> 28:06.759
Gin makes him sad
and sentimental.

28:06.828 --> 28:08.761
I've seen that look
in his eyes before.

28:08.830 --> 28:10.630
Mostly in the mirror.

28:11.766 --> 28:13.733
Your friend's lost his way.

28:13.801 --> 28:16.268
I'll see if I can do
something about that.

28:23.144 --> 28:25.077
Thanks for meeting me here.

28:25.146 --> 28:28.581
Well, you're the only person
I know in Louisiana,

28:28.650 --> 28:30.961
so I didn't have much of a
choice for a drinking companion.

28:30.985 --> 28:33.586
Yeah, well, I'm not here
to drink with you, but...

28:33.655 --> 28:36.222
I would like to know why
the CIA suspended you.

28:38.226 --> 28:40.060
Well, I could tell you,
but then...

28:40.084 --> 28:40.827
You'd have to kill me.

28:40.828 --> 28:42.539
Yeah, I know.
That joke was never that funny.

28:42.563 --> 28:44.797
What happened, Liam?

28:44.866 --> 28:47.233
Bosses found out

28:47.301 --> 28:48.668
I was digging into
the Zelko raid.

28:48.736 --> 28:50.603
Asking questions.

28:50.672 --> 28:52.605
They told me to stand down,

28:52.674 --> 28:54.974
so I told them to screw off.

28:55.043 --> 28:56.342
Brilliant move. What's next?

28:56.411 --> 28:57.777
<i>The New York Times?</i>

28:59.714 --> 29:01.180
You can't.

29:01.249 --> 29:03.015
We have blood on our hands.

29:03.084 --> 29:04.817
All of us.

29:04.886 --> 29:07.853
And someone on our team
tried to cover it up.

29:07.922 --> 29:09.488
- Who?
- I don't know.

29:09.557 --> 29:11.490
But I'll find out.

29:13.161 --> 29:15.494
It'd go a lot faster
if I had some help.

29:16.564 --> 29:18.998
Can't.

29:19.067 --> 29:20.428
'Cause you're afraid
of finding out the truth?

29:20.429 --> 29:23.669
No, because the world is a
better place without Zelko in it is why.

29:23.738 --> 29:25.337
We made mistakes, yeah.

29:25.406 --> 29:27.006
But we did the best we could.

29:27.075 --> 29:29.542
Somebody drank the Kool-Aid.

29:29.610 --> 29:31.677
Zelko tried to kill my family.

29:31.746 --> 29:33.312
And in exchange, we killed his.

29:33.381 --> 29:35.681
Ah, it's a regular
fairy tale ending.

29:35.750 --> 29:37.883
It's just not that
simple for me.

29:37.952 --> 29:39.885
Well, there you have it.

29:41.422 --> 29:43.355
I'm on my own.

29:43.424 --> 29:45.891
Liam. Liam, wait.

29:45.960 --> 29:47.560
Just wait.

29:47.628 --> 29:49.662
This is a lot to process

29:49.731 --> 29:51.363
for me, okay?
I know.

29:51.432 --> 29:53.866
I want to hear you out. I do.

29:53.935 --> 29:55.835
Tomorrow.

29:55.903 --> 29:59.071
Okay? You come sober.

30:02.143 --> 30:04.076
I'll come with an open mind.

30:04.145 --> 30:06.078
Okay.

30:08.649 --> 30:10.583
It's a plan.
Okay.

30:21.295 --> 30:22.661
Little late for
a staff meeting.

30:43.317 --> 30:46.252
- Don't do this.
- I have to.

30:55.997 --> 30:58.097
This is the last time.

30:58.166 --> 31:00.699
Or I swear I'll call the cops.

31:06.641 --> 31:07.907
Gun!

31:07.975 --> 31:09.241
In here!

31:09.310 --> 31:11.477
Oh!

31:35.803 --> 31:37.736
Betros, hang in there.
Shooter's in the wind.

31:37.805 --> 31:39.471
Call 911.

31:39.540 --> 31:40.573
He's still alive.

31:49.806 --> 31:51.316
Steve Betros is out of surgery,

31:51.340 --> 31:53.107
but he's still sedated in ICU.

31:53.567 --> 31:56.000
Well, hopefully he'll I.D.
the shooter as he wakes up.

31:56.069 --> 31:57.535
Any idea what information

31:57.604 --> 31:59.437
he was giving the suspect
at his office?

31:59.506 --> 32:02.006
Well, Patton's still trying to
access the Murder Index server.

32:02.075 --> 32:03.586
Smart money says they're picking
their next victim.

32:03.610 --> 32:05.343
- Yeah.
- Flag on the play.

32:05.412 --> 32:07.312
We don't think
Betros is involved.

32:08.782 --> 32:11.616
We don't?

32:11.685 --> 32:13.284
Crane's actually
sort of helpful.

32:13.353 --> 32:15.486
Even compliments from you
come off as snarky.

32:15.555 --> 32:18.723
It's a gift. Crane and I
established a timeline.

32:18.792 --> 32:20.558
Turns out Steve Betros

32:20.627 --> 32:22.860
and A.D.A. Davenport have
alibis for all four murders.

32:22.929 --> 32:25.330
Kind of blows our <i>Strangers</i>
<i>on a Train</i> theory, though.

32:25.398 --> 32:27.065
Okay, well, if Davenport
and Steve Betros

32:27.133 --> 32:29.000
aren't involved,
that leaves...

32:29.069 --> 32:30.368
James Ferrington.

32:30.437 --> 32:31.881
Pride and Lasalle have
him in Interrogation now.

32:31.905 --> 32:33.204
<i>This may have started</i>

32:33.273 --> 32:34.706
as some warped idea
of justice,

32:34.774 --> 32:36.975
but innocent people
are dying now.

32:37.043 --> 32:38.810
I didn't kill any of them.

32:38.878 --> 32:40.812
But you know who did, don't you?

32:46.586 --> 32:48.419
Okay.

32:50.490 --> 32:54.025
Why don't you tell us
about your son

32:54.094 --> 32:56.427
instead?

33:01.668 --> 33:04.369
He was gonna major
in criminal justice.

33:05.805 --> 33:07.672
He wanted to be like me.

33:07.741 --> 33:09.340
Must have been proud.

33:09.409 --> 33:10.575
When he was a kid,

33:10.644 --> 33:12.243
he told all his friends

33:12.312 --> 33:13.945
that I was
a real-life superhero.

33:14.014 --> 33:17.348
But when it mattered the most,
I wasn't there to help him.

33:19.352 --> 33:22.220
A father's
not supposed to bury his son.

33:22.289 --> 33:24.188
Charlie Reese's father

33:24.257 --> 33:25.723
buried him, too.

33:25.792 --> 33:28.860
Now Lydia Davenport's mother
will do the same.

33:28.928 --> 33:31.629
Be the superhero
your son looked up to.

33:31.698 --> 33:34.232
Help us stop
the killing.

33:39.306 --> 33:41.406
About a year ago,

33:41.474 --> 33:43.408
Steve told everybody

33:43.476 --> 33:46.244
about his idea
for the Murder Index.

33:46.313 --> 33:49.213
But he needed raw data from
law enforcement agencies.

33:49.282 --> 33:52.283
Which you and Lydia Davenport
could provide.

33:52.352 --> 33:55.320
We just wanted to
expose the murderers,

33:55.388 --> 33:57.989
not kill anybody.

33:58.058 --> 34:01.125
Someone else
had different plans?

34:01.194 --> 34:03.895
His name is Guy DeWalt.

34:03.963 --> 34:07.131
Instead of finding solace
in the group sessions,

34:07.200 --> 34:08.466
they just fueled his rage.

34:08.534 --> 34:10.301
They made him angrier,
more extreme.

34:10.370 --> 34:11.936
Did he tell you
what he was doing?

34:12.005 --> 34:13.170
No.

34:13.239 --> 34:15.172
But we figured it
out pretty quick,

34:15.241 --> 34:17.742
especially when he started
asking about police procedure.

34:17.811 --> 34:21.112
He became obsessed
with forensic protocol.

34:21.181 --> 34:22.513
How to clean up after himself.

34:22.581 --> 34:24.148
Leave no trace.

34:24.217 --> 34:26.362
With enough knowledge,
he could manipulate crime scenes

34:26.386 --> 34:27.812
to make it look like there
were different killers.

34:27.813 --> 34:29.821
We knew we had to stop him.

34:29.889 --> 34:31.121
Just didn't know how.

34:31.190 --> 34:32.301
You should have gone
to the police.

34:32.324 --> 34:33.623
And be let down by the system?

34:33.693 --> 34:35.860
Again?

34:35.929 --> 34:39.464
But Lydia-- she agreed
to speak with that reporter.

34:39.532 --> 34:41.165
Crane.

34:41.234 --> 34:43.266
He must've figured out
what she was planning.

34:43.335 --> 34:45.603
He killed her, too.

34:45.672 --> 34:49.706
All I wanted was
justice for my boy.

34:52.746 --> 34:54.712
Guy DeWalt is
a former Green Beret.

34:54.781 --> 34:56.481
Dishonorable discharge
for insubordination.

34:56.549 --> 34:58.649
And he has a long history
of anger problems.

34:58.718 --> 35:01.319
Have any specific connections
to these vigilante cases?

35:01.388 --> 35:03.888
Oh, yeah. DeWalt
and Wyndham served in the--

35:03.957 --> 35:05.723
in the Army together.
They were BFFs.

35:05.792 --> 35:06.912
He even spoke
at his funeral.

35:08.795 --> 35:11.896
Sorry, was it not my turn
to speak?

35:11.965 --> 35:14.866
So we got a clear motive for
going after Wyndham's murderer.

35:14.934 --> 35:16.345
Yeah, except he killed
Charlie Reese,

35:16.369 --> 35:17.802
who was innocent.

35:17.871 --> 35:19.048
Which is why I think
DeWalt is looking

35:19.072 --> 35:20.638
for Wyndham's real killer now.

35:20.707 --> 35:21.973
You know, the last thing

35:22.041 --> 35:24.008
Betros did before he got shot

35:24.077 --> 35:26.344
was run his murder algorithms
on Wyndham's case again.

35:26.413 --> 35:28.913
DeWalt forced
Betros to find him

35:28.982 --> 35:31.182
the next most likely suspect.

35:31.251 --> 35:33.217
Wallace Fanning.

35:33.286 --> 35:34.986
Pulling his address up
right now.

35:35.054 --> 35:37.655
Send the details to my phone.
Christopher, let's go.

35:41.728 --> 35:43.394
Can I help you?

35:43.463 --> 35:45.663
Is that the data
that Betros used

35:45.732 --> 35:47.732
to run Wyndham's
murder algorithm?

35:47.801 --> 35:49.267
Yeah. Why?

35:49.335 --> 35:50.868
Because the date
of the murder's wrong.

35:50.937 --> 35:53.204
It was in June, not July.

35:53.273 --> 35:55.606
Faulty data,
faulty results.

35:55.675 --> 35:58.543
Which means Wallace Fanning
is probably innocent, too.

35:58.611 --> 36:01.379
Betros's algorithm
may not be ethical,

36:01.448 --> 36:03.014
but it is effective.

36:03.082 --> 36:04.916
If we were to plug in
the correct data...

36:04.984 --> 36:06.884
We could probably I.D.
the real killer.

36:11.291 --> 36:12.291
NCIS.

36:12.325 --> 36:13.335
Looking for Wallace Fanning,

36:13.359 --> 36:14.559
the man who lives here.

36:14.627 --> 36:15.627
You're not the only one.

36:15.695 --> 36:16.627
Place is empty.

36:16.696 --> 36:18.095
Got reports
of shots fired.

36:18.164 --> 36:19.842
Looks like there was some kind
of struggle inside.

36:19.866 --> 36:21.699
All right. Thank you.

36:21.768 --> 36:23.012
DeWalt must already
have Fanning.

36:23.036 --> 36:26.037
Taking him back to that alley,
finish what he started?

36:28.374 --> 36:30.374
Guy DeWalt
went after the wrong man.

36:30.443 --> 36:31.542
How do you know?

36:31.611 --> 36:33.088
Because Patton and I
just found the right one.

36:33.112 --> 36:34.779
Come on.
Where are you going?

36:34.848 --> 36:37.648
To catch a killer
and save an innocent man's life.

36:37.717 --> 36:39.083
I guess we should go?

36:39.152 --> 36:40.918
Yeah.

36:51.364 --> 36:52.797
I'll circle round back.
Yeah.

36:58.071 --> 36:59.237
Please.

36:59.305 --> 37:00.683
I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:00.707 --> 37:02.840
I-I didn't--
I didn't kill anyone.

37:02.909 --> 37:03.750
You think lying's
going to save you?

37:03.751 --> 37:05.354
I got no idea
what you're talking about!

37:05.378 --> 37:06.911
I swear!

37:06.980 --> 37:08.513
Federal agent!
Drop the weapon!

37:10.350 --> 37:11.949
Or what?

37:12.018 --> 37:12.950
Drop it!

37:13.019 --> 37:14.019
You want
to shoot me,

37:14.053 --> 37:14.986
yeah, that's fine.

37:15.054 --> 37:16.654
You can do anything
you want to me.

37:16.723 --> 37:18.856
Just as soon as this man pays
for what he did!

37:29.410 --> 37:31.677
This isn't justice,
DeWalt.

37:31.745 --> 37:33.812
Wyndham's memory
deserves better than this.

37:33.881 --> 37:35.647
Wyndham's throat was slit
in this alley.

37:35.716 --> 37:37.850
No one gave a crap
about his memory then.

37:37.918 --> 37:40.085
I can't answer for that.

37:40.154 --> 37:43.322
But I can tell you that this man

37:43.390 --> 37:45.090
did not kill
your friend.

37:45.159 --> 37:46.458
Don't. Don't you try

37:46.527 --> 37:48.594
and play me here.

37:50.097 --> 37:52.197
I'm not playing you.

37:52.266 --> 37:53.799
I'm just giving you
the facts.

37:53.868 --> 37:55.968
You're about
to kill another

37:56.036 --> 37:57.036
innocent man.

37:57.071 --> 37:58.504
Not another step!

37:58.572 --> 37:59.705
This man killed Arthur!

38:15.389 --> 38:16.488
Hold still!

38:21.061 --> 38:24.696
Wallace Fanning didn't kill
Dr. Wyndham.

38:24.765 --> 38:26.965
NOPD officers
have just arrested Johnny Nolan,

38:27.034 --> 38:29.001
the man responsible
for the brutal murder

38:29.069 --> 38:30.302
of Dr. Arthur Wyndham.

38:30.371 --> 38:32.538
Nolan had been
previously convicted

38:32.606 --> 38:34.473
for selling drugs
in the same alley

38:34.542 --> 38:36.308
where Dr. Wyndham's body
was found.

38:36.377 --> 38:39.244
Personal items belonging to
the doctor were also recovered,

38:39.313 --> 38:40.712
including a commemorative knife

38:40.781 --> 38:43.715
honoring his service
in the Special Forces.

38:43.784 --> 38:45.984
So there's finally an end
to this tragic story

38:46.053 --> 38:47.553
of twisted justice.

38:47.621 --> 38:50.055
As always, we here
at the BreakingNOLA team

38:50.124 --> 38:52.491
will continue looking into
the darkest corners of this city

38:52.560 --> 38:54.092
to bring you the truth.

38:54.161 --> 38:56.695
Oh.
Check it out. I went viral.

38:56.764 --> 38:57.774
Glad to see you back

38:57.798 --> 38:59.097
on track, Crane.
Yeah.

38:59.166 --> 39:00.766
Means I don't have
to play dead anymore.

39:00.834 --> 39:03.602
Unless that's why
I went viral.

39:03.671 --> 39:05.248
Is that your way of thanking
us for keeping you alive

39:05.272 --> 39:06.838
and giving you the
story of the year?

39:06.907 --> 39:08.862
We really do work very well
together, don't you think?

39:08.886 --> 39:09.108
Oh?

39:09.109 --> 39:10.487
Maybe we could make this
a regular thing.

39:10.511 --> 39:11.777
Oliver Crane,

39:11.845 --> 39:15.214
NCIS special
investigative consultant.

39:15.282 --> 39:16.293
It's got a nice ring to it.

39:16.317 --> 39:17.427
Well,
you know what they say

39:17.451 --> 39:19.384
about too much
of a good thing...

39:19.453 --> 39:21.720
Yeah. It's even better.

39:21.789 --> 39:23.555
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

39:23.624 --> 39:25.424
Just take care
of yourself, Crane.

39:25.492 --> 39:26.592
All right.

39:26.660 --> 39:28.260
Try not to get
shot at again.

39:28.329 --> 39:29.561
Yeah.

39:33.267 --> 39:35.145
You want to go finish
that game of <i>Risk</i> we started?

39:35.169 --> 39:37.209
Oh, my God, yes. I thought
you were never gonna ask.

Jimmy!

39:58.559 --> 40:01.126
I'm guessing you're here
for business, not pleasure.

40:01.195 --> 40:02.195
You seen Liam?

40:02.229 --> 40:03.895
He hasn't been by tonight.
I was supposed

40:03.964 --> 40:05.609
to meet him at his hotel,
but he checked out.

40:05.633 --> 40:07.432
He's not answering
his phone either.

40:07.501 --> 40:08.433
That doesn't sound
promising, does it?

40:08.502 --> 40:10.335
No, it really
doesn't. Damn it.

40:10.404 --> 40:11.444
You two have
a falling out?

40:11.505 --> 40:12.604
Yeah. Sort of.

40:12.673 --> 40:14.273
I came here to... fix it.

40:14.341 --> 40:16.341
Explain myself. But...

40:16.410 --> 40:18.259
I guess he doesn't
want to hear it.

40:18.283 --> 40:19.471
Well, one thing I'm sure of:

40:19.472 --> 40:22.135
you're trying to be a friend to
a man who's clearly suffering.

40:22.934 --> 40:23.934
It's not on you.

40:24.792 --> 40:26.826
That's really nice of you
to say, Jimmy,

40:26.895 --> 40:28.861
but it's not necessarily true.

40:45.213 --> 40:47.013
<i>Uh, got your messages.</i>

40:47.081 --> 40:48.626
Sorry I missed you at the hotel,
but some,

40:48.650 --> 40:51.017
uh, interesting business
turned up overseas

40:51.085 --> 40:52.885
and I had to catch a plane.

40:52.954 --> 40:56.088
Um, I can't get into details
over the phone, but, uh,

40:56.157 --> 40:58.558
yeah, I'll-I'll fill you in
the next time I'm in town.

40:58.626 --> 41:02.195
Listen,
I-I put too much on you, Hannah.

41:02.263 --> 41:04.096
I just don't have anyone else
I can talk to

41:04.165 --> 41:06.098
about this thing.

41:06.167 --> 41:07.600
Um...

41:07.669 --> 41:09.535
Hey, give the princess
a hug for me.

41:09.604 --> 41:11.270
Tell her, uh,

41:11.339 --> 41:13.706
I'll have to take a rain check
on all that junk food.

41:13.775 --> 41:16.209
All right, well, -

41:16.277 --> 41:17.743
talk soon.

41:17.812 --> 41:19.412
Hey, Mom!

41:19.480 --> 41:21.113
Hey, baby.

41:22.640 --> 41:24.231
Hey.

41:24.232 --> 41:25.307
Like I said,

41:25.308 --> 41:26.507
piece of cake.

41:26.576 --> 41:29.210
Oh, my God, you got an
A-plus on your math test!

41:29.278 --> 41:31.045
Mm-hmm.

41:31.113 --> 41:33.047
Come here.

41:33.115 --> 41:35.883
Come here.

41:38.855 --> 41:40.988
Everything okay, Mom?

41:41.057 --> 41:42.490
Yeah.

41:42.558 --> 41:44.492
It will be, baby.

41:46.462 --> 41:48.229
It will be.
