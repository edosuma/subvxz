00:29.080 --> 00:30.560
[Thunder]

00:30.560 --> 00:32.920
I'll take off
the bag as soon as--

00:32.920 --> 00:34.240
Hey, they're here!

00:34.240 --> 00:35.560
This better be good,

00:35.560 --> 00:37.080
'cause we're going to
get electrocuted.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.640
So who's this mystery guy
we've been hearing about?

00:43.160 --> 00:45.960
Guys, my friend Sam.

00:48.320 --> 00:50.240
The guy's a girl!

00:50.240 --> 00:51.680
Sam?

00:51.680 --> 00:53.080
It's Samantha.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.240
My friends
call me Sam.

00:55.240 --> 00:57.240
Yo, Sam, I'm Frank,
and, uh...

00:57.240 --> 01:00.240
I think you're the hottest
thing around this campfire.

01:00.240 --> 01:03.640
<i>Thanks. You can
call me Samantha.</i>

01:03.640 --> 01:05.640
Ow! Oh!
Mercy! Mercy!

01:05.640 --> 01:07.760
The babe's got bite!

01:09.080 --> 01:10.520
I think
you're perfect...

01:10.520 --> 01:12.200
Uh, for
the Midnight Society.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.040
Do you know the rules?

01:14.040 --> 01:16.040
Sure. I tell
you guys a story.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.040
If you guys like it,
I'm in.

01:18.040 --> 01:19.200
If not...

01:19.200 --> 01:20.360
[Thunder]

01:20.360 --> 01:21.840
I'm on the highway.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.760
Let's get going,
OK?

01:32.600 --> 01:33.840
Good luck.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.480
You're on.

01:35.480 --> 01:39.040
I have lots of stories
I could have told,

01:39.040 --> 01:42.520
but I picked one that
kind of fits the setting.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.040
There are tons of ancient
legends about the woods--

01:45.040 --> 01:48.520
legends of spirits like
the Manitou or the Windigo--

01:48.520 --> 01:50.520
but whatever happened
to these spirits

01:50.520 --> 01:53.520
once people showed up
to hack down their world?

01:53.520 --> 01:55.040
Many moved on,

01:55.040 --> 01:58.600
but some say the truly evil ones
clung to home,

01:58.600 --> 02:01.960
with twisted hearts
full of revenge

02:01.960 --> 02:05.600
for all who dare
disturb their home.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.960
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

02:08.960 --> 02:11.039
I call this story...

02:43.880 --> 02:45.840
[Sam]
It was Sarah's first time

02:45.840 --> 02:47.320
at camp grindlestone.

02:47.320 --> 02:48.840
She was a superachiever

02:48.840 --> 02:51.480
who had every medal
a trailmaker could earn.

02:51.480 --> 02:55.000
Only problem was, Sarah was
so busy with activities,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.880
she didn't have
much time for friends.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.520
Kelly, on the other hand,

02:59.520 --> 03:01.920
had been to grindlestone before
and hated it.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.280
She had tons of friends at home

03:04.280 --> 03:06.320
and really didn't
want to be there.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.200
Ooh!

03:14.000 --> 03:15.080
Walk much?

03:15.080 --> 03:16.520
Sorry. Let me help.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.160
Uh, no one
touches my stuff.

03:19.160 --> 03:22.360
I'm Sarah. It's
my first time here.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.960
I'm thrilled.
What tent you in?

03:24.960 --> 03:26.960
Six. How about you?

03:26.960 --> 03:28.600
Six?

03:28.600 --> 03:30.400
Yeah.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.160
Great.
We can be pals.

03:45.040 --> 03:48.000
Is she, like,
too perfect or what?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.440
Oh, look--
here's the one she got

03:50.440 --> 03:52.960
for jumping out
of an airplane and living.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.960
And here's the one
she got for cleaning up

03:55.960 --> 03:58.440
all the pollution
in the whole world!

03:58.440 --> 03:59.960
Here's the one she got

03:59.960 --> 04:01.880
for never doing
anything wrong ever.

04:01.880 --> 04:04.400
Of course, everybody
gets that one.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.120
Hi, guys.
Mind if I hang out?

04:09.480 --> 04:11.480
Has anybody seen my
trailmaker's vest?

04:12.960 --> 04:14.960
[Squeaking]

04:16.480 --> 04:18.200
Bats.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.920
They hate music.

04:19.920 --> 04:23.920
<i>That is what you're
playing, Sylvie, isn't it?</i>

04:23.920 --> 04:24.640
Ha ha.

04:26.320 --> 04:29.320
[Sarah]
This place is pretty cool.

04:31.960 --> 04:34.680
"Never enter
Watcher's Woods. Ever."

04:38.360 --> 04:40.320
What's Watcher's Woods?

04:40.320 --> 04:42.320
[Sour chord]

04:42.320 --> 04:44.560
You're new,
so I'll tell you.

04:44.560 --> 04:47.520
It's a place where
people get blipped.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.080
Blipped?

04:49.080 --> 04:51.400
Lost. Vaporized.
Erased.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.400
The legend goes way back.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.400
Indian tribes,
colonial soldiers,

04:55.400 --> 04:56.920
pioneers...

04:56.920 --> 04:59.200
All gone,
never seen again.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.920
So where is
this place?

05:00.920 --> 05:02.280
No one knows.

05:02.280 --> 05:04.840
They say it moves
like a shark,

05:04.840 --> 05:06.240
looking for victims,

05:06.240 --> 05:08.840
and once you realize
you're inside,

05:08.840 --> 05:10.840
it's too late.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.840
Sounds like a stupid
camp story to me.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.080
Why is it called
Watcher's Woods?

05:16.080 --> 05:19.200
The few who escaped
came back crazy,

05:19.200 --> 05:21.880
babbling something
about the watcher--

05:21.880 --> 05:24.880
a demon who
guards the woods

05:24.880 --> 05:27.480
and picks out
its victims.

05:27.480 --> 05:31.120
They blipped in 1919.

05:31.120 --> 05:36.280
Tomorrow will be 75 years
to the day.

05:36.280 --> 05:40.000
They went for a hike
and were never seen again.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.040
The only trace
the searchers found...

05:43.040 --> 05:45.120
were their whistles.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.720
Care to go
for a little hike

05:47.720 --> 05:49.880
in Watcher's Woods,
superstar?

05:51.520 --> 05:53.400
Uhh! Aah!

05:53.400 --> 05:55.080
Rats! I hate rats!

05:55.080 --> 05:57.400
It was only
a little rat.

06:11.720 --> 06:15.400
This is going to be
a long couple of weeks.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.000
[Woman]
You'll work in teams of two.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.320
The goal's to collect

06:20.320 --> 06:23.320
as many specimens as you can
for your nature medals

06:23.320 --> 06:24.800
and get back before dark.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.320
Kelly, I want you
to take Sarah.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.320
You know the woods
pretty well.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.320
Maybe we'll find
Watcher's Woods.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.840
And remember--

06:32.840 --> 06:34.600
no fires.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.640
We don't want
any accidents.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.240
Have fun.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.320
So where do we start?

06:44.320 --> 06:47.400
Start by keeping
out of my face.

06:50.400 --> 06:53.840
Do you know what the manual
says to do if you get lost?

06:53.840 --> 06:55.320
No, but I'll
bet you do.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.840
Three sharps blasts
on the whistle.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.320
That's the call for help.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.320
Gee, thanks. I'll try
to remember that.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.760
You're going to smoke?

07:01.760 --> 07:02.920
Yes.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.760
The fire warning
is up.

07:04.760 --> 07:07.280
You are just too
perfect, aren't you?

07:07.280 --> 07:09.280
I am not.
It's just that--

07:09.280 --> 07:11.440
Look, I'm not into
this medal stuff.

07:11.440 --> 07:12.760
Let's just chill

07:12.760 --> 07:14.760
and sneak back
to camp, OK?

07:14.760 --> 07:17.280
No! I like it.
That's why I'm here.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.280
Yeah?
I'm here because my parents

07:19.280 --> 07:22.280
want me out of the house
for two weeks.

07:22.280 --> 07:23.960
I'll make you a deal.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.280
I know these woods.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.280
I'll show you
a pheasant nest

07:27.280 --> 07:30.280
if we can cut out early
and go swimming.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.840
A pheasant's nest?
Really?

07:33.360 --> 07:34.800
Deal.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.200
OK, mother nature.
Let's roll.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.280
Through there.

07:42.280 --> 07:43.800
It's
a tight squeeze.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.280
Give me your pack.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.280
Do you think
they're still nesting?

07:47.280 --> 07:49.360
Gosh, I don't know.
Go look.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.240
For somebody smart,
you're pretty dim.

08:01.240 --> 08:02.800
Adios.

08:14.320 --> 08:15.800
What...

08:25.800 --> 08:28.800
I don't see
any nest in there.

08:30.800 --> 08:31.960
Kelly?

08:33.480 --> 08:34.799
Kelly?

08:39.320 --> 08:40.760
Oh, man!

08:40.760 --> 08:42.799
I don't believe this.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.320
<i>I can't be lost.
No way.</i>

09:06.240 --> 09:08.520
<i>This is not happening.</i>

09:14.280 --> 09:15.760
What?

09:47.760 --> 09:50.280
There was a path here.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.720
Kelly!

09:58.720 --> 10:00.200
[Echo]
Kelly!

10:00.200 --> 10:01.720
Kelly!

10:01.720 --> 10:02.960
[Echo]
Kelly!

10:09.120 --> 10:10.720
Kelly!

10:10.720 --> 10:12.280
[Echo]
Kelly!

10:13.800 --> 10:17.120
[Deep voice]
Sarah...

10:31.840 --> 10:32.840
Aah!

10:33.800 --> 10:36.680
Welcome... to my woods.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.720
OK, be cool.
Don't lose it.

10:43.720 --> 10:47.120
You can get out of this.
You just got to...

10:48.800 --> 10:50.000
Yes!

11:06.080 --> 11:07.240
Ohh!

11:14.240 --> 11:16.520
Uh, hello?

11:17.800 --> 11:19.400
Anybody there?

11:26.520 --> 11:27.920
Hello?

11:29.560 --> 11:31.240
Hello?

11:34.560 --> 11:35.520
[Static]

11:41.480 --> 11:45.680
[Flies buzzing]

11:45.680 --> 11:48.200
Gross. What died?

11:54.080 --> 11:57.080
Maybe I don't
need help that bad.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.040
Aah!

12:15.720 --> 12:17.760
Welcome
to Watcher's Woods...

12:18.800 --> 12:19.760
Dearie.

12:19.760 --> 12:20.760
Aah!

12:26.640 --> 12:28.640
Who are you?

12:30.440 --> 12:33.080
It took us 75 years,

12:33.080 --> 12:35.400
but finally,
we've got her.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.080
We've waited.
Oh, how we've waited.

12:38.080 --> 12:41.920
Are we sure it's her?
I'm not so sure.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.000
I'm not her!

12:44.000 --> 12:45.840
Who's her?

12:45.840 --> 12:48.920
Now, do you tell us where
you put our whistles,

12:48.920 --> 12:51.880
or do we work on
our archery medals?

12:51.880 --> 12:53.720
What whistles?

12:53.720 --> 12:55.240
I guess we shoot.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.840
Can't we play
with her a bit first?

12:57.840 --> 12:58.600
No!

12:59.840 --> 13:02.080
Ready...

13:02.080 --> 13:02.800
Aim...

13:04.600 --> 13:06.240
Fire!

13:06.240 --> 13:06.960
No!

13:10.000 --> 13:11.800
Bull's-eye.

13:15.760 --> 13:19.280
Now, what about
our whistles?

13:19.280 --> 13:20.760
You...

13:20.760 --> 13:22.880
You're the missing
trailmakers.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.920
But you've been
gone since--

13:24.920 --> 13:27.280
1919. See?

13:27.280 --> 13:29.520
Her memory's
coming back.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.840
Ha ha ha!

13:46.400 --> 13:48.000
Why did you steal
our whistles?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.040
I didn't.
I don't even know you!

13:50.040 --> 13:53.200
You tricked us. You
left us here to die.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.440
Worse--you left us
for the watcher.

13:56.440 --> 13:57.280
[Spits]

14:05.960 --> 14:07.560
The watcher--

14:07.560 --> 14:09.560
he said he'd
hold our souls

14:09.560 --> 14:11.440
till we found
our whistles.

14:11.440 --> 14:13.280
He knew we'd
never find them.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.280
So it's eternity
for us in his woods.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.560
And it's all
your fault.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.000
But now
we've got you,

14:21.000 --> 14:22.720
and soon,

14:22.720 --> 14:26.320
you'll be old
and dead, as we are.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.480
Almost family.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.000
Ha ha ha!

14:31.000 --> 14:33.880
I...I know where
your whistles are.

14:33.880 --> 14:36.000
If you let me go,
I'll go get them.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Hmm!

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
If we let you go,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.160
would you come back?

14:48.160 --> 14:50.280
Yes, I--
yes, I swear!

15:00.560 --> 15:01.800
Oh, dearie?

15:09.080 --> 15:10.600
We don't believe you.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.360
No!

15:13.360 --> 15:14.680
Ha ha ha!

15:22.600 --> 15:24.320
What scares
you most?

15:24.320 --> 15:25.440
What?

15:25.440 --> 15:26.960
Let me guess.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.520
I know.

15:31.520 --> 15:34.880
How would you
like to play...

15:34.880 --> 15:36.240
With some rodents?

15:36.240 --> 15:37.240
Aah!

15:38.600 --> 15:40.000
Aah!

15:40.000 --> 15:42.960
I don't think
she likes rodents.

15:42.960 --> 15:46.480
Well, we'll give her a
chance to make friends.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.720
Careful, now.
They're very fast.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.480
Why did it
have to be rats?

16:00.520 --> 16:01.640
Kelly.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.720
Sarah! Sarah,
get me out of here.

16:05.280 --> 16:07.320
I'm sorry I made
fun of you.

16:07.320 --> 16:08.960
I'm sorry
I got you lost.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.480
Shh. Be quiet.

16:10.480 --> 16:13.280
They're ghosts, Sarah. They
think I stole their whistles.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.800
I wouldn't do that!

16:14.800 --> 16:16.800
No?
You did it to me.

16:16.800 --> 16:17.960
I'm sorry!

16:17.960 --> 16:19.960
This is Watcher's Woods.
It's real!

16:19.960 --> 16:21.920
We're never going
to get out.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.920
Yes, we are.
Just...

16:23.920 --> 16:25.960
[Hag]
Try this.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.200
Aah!
Aah!

16:33.280 --> 16:34.400
Well, well,
another visitor.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.800
What are we going
to do with this one?

16:36.800 --> 16:39.400
Why not work
on our survival medal

16:39.400 --> 16:41.320
and hunt her for food?

16:41.320 --> 16:42.920
Wait.
I can help you.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.080
How?

16:44.080 --> 16:45.600
I can get
your whistles.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.280
I know where
they are.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.480
Are you certain?

16:48.480 --> 16:50.320
Yes. I can run back
and get them.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.080
We'll keep
your slimy little friend,

16:52.080 --> 16:53.920
and if you're
not back by sunup,

16:53.920 --> 16:56.520
she'll be food
for the mice and the newts.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.920
Oh, man, Sarah,
are you sure?

16:58.920 --> 17:00.280
You got
a better idea?

17:00.280 --> 17:02.440
If you're going, go.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.920
Could...

17:07.920 --> 17:09.960
Could you move
the bucket?

17:17.520 --> 17:20.440
North star... north star...

17:20.440 --> 17:21.880
north star!

17:21.880 --> 17:23.359
So camp...

17:23.359 --> 17:24.839
that way!

17:27.000 --> 17:30.600
[Deep voice]
Sarah...

17:34.280 --> 17:36.680
What?
Who are you?

17:37.960 --> 17:40.720
I'm watching you.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.880
Sarah...

17:45.880 --> 17:46.840
Sarah...

17:49.000 --> 17:50.400
Aah!

17:56.440 --> 17:58.800
You fascinate me,
Sarah.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.960
I'm eager
to add a soul

18:01.960 --> 18:04.400
such as yours

18:04.400 --> 18:07.040
to my
precious woods.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.320
Come.

18:09.640 --> 18:10.640
Join me.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.560
Back off.

18:15.960 --> 18:18.080
Flame cannot
harm me.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.240
Maybe not you,

18:19.240 --> 18:21.240
but I could torch
your precious woods

18:21.240 --> 18:22.520
like dry kindling.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.880
Now let me pass.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.200
I don't believe you.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.000
Try me.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.400
She's not back yet.

18:59.400 --> 19:02.280
So, shall we start
on our cooking medals

19:02.280 --> 19:04.760
or on our
pet-keeping medals?

19:04.760 --> 19:06.760
Why not cook
half of her

19:06.760 --> 19:09.600
and teach the other
half to do tricks?

19:09.600 --> 19:11.400
Ha ha ha!

19:16.000 --> 19:18.840
Has to be sharp
to be painless.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.120
Sarah!

19:22.120 --> 19:24.240
Got them!

19:27.520 --> 19:29.360
Give them to me!

19:31.920 --> 19:34.360
It's three we need
to break the spell,

19:34.360 --> 19:35.520
not two!

19:35.520 --> 19:38.160
But I had them
just a minute ago.

19:38.160 --> 19:39.880
What a nasty thing
to do to us!

19:39.880 --> 19:41.360
You didn't
use your head.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.160
But we will.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.800
Wait! Just let me
look for them.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.880
Too late! Too
late! Too late!

19:56.000 --> 19:58.960
We're going to make
such a mess!

19:58.960 --> 20:00.240
Kelly!

20:00.240 --> 20:01.600
Oh, no!

20:03.160 --> 20:04.760
I found it.
It's over here.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.240
Ignore her.
She lies.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.240
Kelly!

20:07.240 --> 20:08.920
Oh...

20:12.560 --> 20:14.000
Kelly, please!

20:16.680 --> 20:17.960
On my signal...

20:19.120 --> 20:20.600
1...

20:20.600 --> 20:22.200
2...

20:23.400 --> 20:24.200
3!

20:24.200 --> 20:25.200
Aah!

20:27.680 --> 20:29.280
[Blows whistle]

20:38.040 --> 20:38.880
You OK?

20:40.320 --> 20:42.600
Yeah. I think so.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.520
Could it be?

21:07.400 --> 21:08.720
[Tweet]

21:08.720 --> 21:09.560
[Tweet]

21:11.200 --> 21:12.320
[Tweet]

21:37.360 --> 21:38.760
What are those?

21:38.760 --> 21:40.280
It's a trail sign.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.600
It means
I've gone home.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.800
You, uh... came back.

21:44.800 --> 21:45.960
Yeah.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.840
You saved my neck.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.040
Come on.
Let's go home.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.120
Hey, where you been?

22:39.800 --> 22:41.760
Looks like
we're going home!

22:41.760 --> 22:42.960
All right!

22:45.040 --> 22:46.760
The end.

22:46.760 --> 22:49.800
So, what'd
you guys think?

22:58.240 --> 23:00.400
[Whispering]

23:04.800 --> 23:06.040
Um...

23:07.480 --> 23:09.240
I don't know how
to tell you this...

23:09.240 --> 23:10.440
Uh, that's OK.

23:10.440 --> 23:11.920
That's OK.
I understand.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.240
Thanks for the shot.

23:13.240 --> 23:14.560
What I mean is,

23:14.560 --> 23:17.080
it's going to
be real hard

23:17.080 --> 23:19.440
calling somebody
that looks like you...

23:19.440 --> 23:20.800
Sam.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.040
Welcome to
the Midnight Society.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.480
Thanks.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.200
No.

23:27.200 --> 23:28.480
You're great.
