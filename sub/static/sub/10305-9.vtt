WEBVTT

00:02.960 --> 00:05.793
Okay, kids, you know what today is?

00:06.000 --> 00:09.117
Mom, don't ask Kelly
tough questions like that.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.117
I know what today is.

00:11.320 --> 00:14.915
It's the bright sunny part
before tonight.

00:16.760 --> 00:20.230
I guess I shouldn't have cleaned
her crib with Easy-Off.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.196
Listen, Slow White...

00:26.080 --> 00:27.638
...it's Dad's birthday.

00:27.840 --> 00:30.274
<i>For I'm a jolly good fellow</i>

00:36.640 --> 00:39.518
<i>For I'm a jolly good fellow
For I'm a jolly good fellow</i>

00:39.720 --> 00:42.154
<i>Who never zips up his fly</i>

00:45.160 --> 00:47.037
Al, I thought
you didn't like birthdays.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.196
Your birthday, Peg.

00:49.680 --> 00:54.071
See, I like getting older, because that
means I'm one year closer to death.

00:55.440 --> 00:59.433
And it means I'm one year closer
to my successful second husband.

00:59.640 --> 01:03.189
- Stepdaddy, yeah.
- Oh, stepdad, stepdad.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.630
Come on, tell us, Mom.
What's he gonna be like?

01:05.840 --> 01:07.239
He's gonna be real cool, right?

01:07.440 --> 01:10.557
And I'll have lots of young
hot stepsisters?

01:10.800 --> 01:13.109
Now, kids, you know the rules.

01:13.320 --> 01:17.996
No talking about Lance
until Daddy's on the respirator.

01:19.480 --> 01:23.473
Now, if you're done, I'd like to discuss
the three cardinal rules of my birthday.

01:23.680 --> 01:27.150
Leave me alone, leave me alone,
no sex.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.870
Gee, Bud,
sounds like your prom night.

01:33.360 --> 01:38.480
As much as I appreciate last year's
lavish gift, a bar of Irish Spring-

01:38.680 --> 01:41.148
With instructional video.

01:41.360 --> 01:45.831
I thought it was the perfect gift,
Soap-On-A-Dope.

01:46.400 --> 01:51.190
- this year, all I want is to be alone,
having breakfast with my loved ones.

01:51.400 --> 01:55.234
- Oh, Daddy, that's so sweet.
- At the Jiggly Room.

01:57.360 --> 02:02.480
Then after work, I'm going to cash in
my free birthday coupons.

02:03.160 --> 02:06.277
You're supposed to be under 6
to get this ice cream.

02:06.480 --> 02:11.270
Well, if that was in inches,
you could get a double scoop.

02:12.440 --> 02:13.793
Laugh all you want, Peg.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.028
Oh, thanks, Al. But after sex last night,
I'm all laughed out.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.112
Speaking of a pig in a blanket...

02:24.000 --> 02:27.117
...I have an IHOP coupon here
I'm not sharing with anybody.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.390
God, old daddy's mean.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.955
Let's make a birthday card
for our new daddy, Lance.

02:32.160 --> 02:33.639
All right.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:10.760 --> 03:13.558
Oh, boy, that Jiggly Room,
that serves a good breakfast.

03:13.760 --> 03:17.878
Oh, yeah. The melons,
the muffins, the sticky buns.

03:18.080 --> 03:22.073
Hey. And the food wasn't bad either.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.276
You guys went to the Jiggly Room
for breakfast?

03:25.480 --> 03:26.435
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.552
We brought you back
an Egg McBig'Un.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.800
Now, that's a Happy Meal.

03:35.280 --> 03:38.192
Yeah, but now
you won't want my gift.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.480
Lunch at the Jiggly Room.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.639
- That's great.
- Yeah, what are we waiting for?

03:47.840 --> 03:49.751
<i>- Come on. It's almost 11:00.
- Let's go.</i>

03:52.360 --> 03:56.399
Where do you think you're going?
Aren't you open?

03:56.600 --> 04:00.309
Sorry, ma'am, but unlike your mouth,
we occasionally close.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.552
I want my money back.

04:03.760 --> 04:08.436
These shoes fell apart after one day
and I want to know why.

04:08.640 --> 04:12.599
Well, you see, ma'am,
this is a plaid heel with a cork filling.

04:12.800 --> 04:16.588
Whereas you are a giant seal
with a pork filling.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.387
You haven't heard the last of this.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.239
What goes around comes around.

04:24.440 --> 04:28.149
Well, considering your orbit,
looks like I have about 10 more years.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.038
How does this place stay open?

04:33.240 --> 04:35.037
It doesn't.

04:40.480 --> 04:44.109
- Wow, great birthday cake, Mom.
- Oh, thanks, Bud.

04:44.320 --> 04:48.552
I've been slaving over it for hours.
I'm almost done.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.115
So, what did you get Daddy
for his birthday?

04:52.320 --> 04:54.834
We're gonna tint the windows
on the Dodge.

04:57.560 --> 05:00.950
Great, then no one will know
we're in the car with him.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.678
And what are you gonna get
the man who has nothing?

05:04.880 --> 05:08.111
Me, the gift that keeps on buying.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.952
Mom, you get him that every year
and every year, he returns it.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.874
Actually, he never even unwraps it.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.833
This year, the birthday boy is
gonna take me out to dinner...

05:19.040 --> 05:20.837
...with those stupid coupons he got.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.473
I'm gonna go take a bath.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.750
With the cake?

05:25.480 --> 05:27.789
It's a sponge cake.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.390
Lance loves my sense of humour.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.634
Bud, quick,
somebody stole Dad's car windows.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.513
Come on. Come on.

05:45.040 --> 05:49.636
Wild idea here, Kel, but maybe
the windows are in the doors.

05:50.960 --> 05:55.476
What idiot would steal the windows
and then put them in the doors?

05:56.240 --> 05:59.391
God, people call me stupid.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.431
Not just people.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.919
Haven't you seen the way
the dog looks at you?

06:05.720 --> 06:09.235
And you remember that time
your sea monkey spelled "moron"?

06:14.760 --> 06:16.716
Man, that was great.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.832
But, Al, you're not 62 years old.

06:20.040 --> 06:23.077
I am when I'm being spanked
by a topless birthday clown.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.878
Speaking of spanking, that reminds me.
I got a big date tonight.

06:28.080 --> 06:31.675
<i>Well, take off. I'm gonna stick around
till 3:30 and get my overtime.</i>

06:33.040 --> 06:35.998
Damn, these one-hour days
are killing me.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.516
Remember me, Bundy?

06:41.720 --> 06:44.553
- No.
- The one you insulted.

06:44.760 --> 06:48.150
I'm sorry, ma'am. You're gonna have
to be a little more specific.

06:48.360 --> 06:52.672
You made fun of my weight.
You called me a giant seal.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.997
Well, let's see. I had four elephants.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.597
I had a rhino
who wanted some flip-flops.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.438
I had a manatee.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.390
No, no, don't remember any seals.
Can you jog my memory?

07:04.600 --> 07:05.555
You know what jog is.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.638
That's what you do
when the ice cream truck is pulling out.

07:11.720 --> 07:14.553
- That's it.
- What? What did I say?

07:15.760 --> 07:19.355
Al Bundy, you are charged
with crimes against obesity.

07:23.440 --> 07:26.989
<i>Two, four, six, eight,
don't mak e fun of our weight.</i>

07:27.200 --> 07:30.556
<i>Two, four, six, eight,
don't mak e fun of our weight.</i>

07:30.760 --> 07:35.356
<i>One, two, three, four,
you're gonna fall through the floor.</i>

07:41.080 --> 07:43.310
Okay. I get it.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.193
The NO MA'AM guys
sent you guys over here, didn't they?

07:46.400 --> 07:47.879
It's a birthday gag.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.150
One of you is supposed to
jump out of a cake...

07:50.400 --> 07:52.197
...but you ate it on the way over,
right?

07:52.920 --> 07:55.753
Bundy, we are activists.

07:55.960 --> 07:59.236
Oh, I'd say not quite active enough.

08:00.640 --> 08:04.918
It so happens we marched yesterday,
shoe schmuck.

08:05.120 --> 08:08.590
In what, the Million Pound March?

08:09.080 --> 08:12.038
What, Hams Across America?

08:12.760 --> 08:17.038
Joke all you want, Bundy.
We've got all night.

08:17.240 --> 08:20.118
I'd love to invite you all
to the Lobster Hut with me...

08:20.320 --> 08:23.835
...but I don't think
I have any coupons for krill.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.868
You're not going anywhere.

08:27.080 --> 08:33.519
And just how do you girls
propose to stop an all-city fullback?

08:45.640 --> 08:48.154
Ladies, I believe
we can work this out.

08:49.760 --> 08:53.514
You're not grasping the gravity
of the situation, Mr. Bundy.

08:53.720 --> 08:57.508
Oh, I think gravity
has its hands full right now.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.950
We are putting you on trial.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.914
When you are found guilty,
you will be punished.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.439
Yeah!

09:06.640 --> 09:07.959
Dip him in chocolate!

09:08.160 --> 09:11.948
It's my birthday.
I wanna use my coupons.

09:12.160 --> 09:16.278
You should have thought about that
before you called me a rhino.

09:17.120 --> 09:19.111
How do you like your flip-flops?

09:19.800 --> 09:21.552
They broke.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.478
I'll get you a new pair right now.

09:24.920 --> 09:27.275
He's making a break for it!

09:30.720 --> 09:33.837
Hey, how come
you get to the read the directions?

09:34.760 --> 09:38.469
Because I can. Now, get in the car.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.798
Kelly.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.273
I know this may be
a new experience for you...

09:48.480 --> 09:50.675
...but why don't you try
the front seat?

09:52.240 --> 09:55.994
Oh, wow, this is so cool.

09:56.760 --> 10:01.231
All these knobs and these buttons
and this big wheel.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.757
Does that look
a little more familiar now?

10:08.120 --> 10:10.918
Oh, yeah.

10:11.160 --> 10:13.720
Just get out of the car, okay?

10:16.160 --> 10:17.639
All right.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.797
Now, you put the tint on.

10:25.640 --> 10:28.871
After I roll up the window.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.474
Did I tell you
how pretty you look today?

10:35.040 --> 10:36.473
No.

10:36.680 --> 10:39.877
Good, then the blood
is still reaching my brain.

10:42.160 --> 10:45.675
You're not gonna get away with this,
especially not with juror number two...

10:45.880 --> 10:49.156
...leaving a trail of tamale hots
from the food court.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.718
Do you want us to gag you?

10:51.920 --> 10:54.912
You're already doing that,
but I would like to be blindfolded.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.231
We will now hear
from our first witness.

10:59.440 --> 11:03.877
My name is Matilda
and that man is fatophobic.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.548
- And ugly!
- Look at his hair!

11:06.760 --> 11:07.954
Order.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.798
- Big Mac.
- Filet-O-fish.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.752
Steamed vegetables.

11:11.960 --> 11:17.557
Okay. A meatball sandwich.
I'll start tomorrow.

11:19.200 --> 11:23.034
I first came to Gary's
about two years ago.

11:25.520 --> 11:26.873
I don't understand it.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.878
I was a size 6 before aerobics class.

11:30.080 --> 11:33.595
All that jumping
must have expanded my foot.

11:34.480 --> 11:37.278
Then I see you must have fallen
on your butt a time or two.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.715
How dare you to say that to my face?

11:41.920 --> 11:45.356
I'd say it behind your back, but my
car has only got a half a tank of gas.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.355
What do you say to that, Bundy?

11:50.560 --> 11:56.430
Well, I'd say I used heroic restraint,
much like the witness's girdle.

11:57.400 --> 12:02.030
For every insult,
you lose a free meal.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.673
Oh, come on. I didn't mean it.

12:03.880 --> 12:07.156
Haven't you ever had something
just slip right out of your mouth?

12:07.400 --> 12:09.470
I suppose not.

12:11.840 --> 12:15.913
Come on,
it's not like I say this stuff all the time.

12:16.520 --> 12:17.714
Are we finished here?

12:17.920 --> 12:20.912
Well, I'm not sure
I like this shade of blue.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.917
I'll tell you what I'll do then.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.429
We'll stand you in front of a mirror.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.995
I'll begin strangling you.

12:29.880 --> 12:33.589
When you reach the shade of blue
that is satisfactory to you...

12:33.800 --> 12:36.917
...you yell "moo" and I'll stop.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.512
That's it.
I'm taking my business elsewhere.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.676
May I suggest Jenny Craig?

12:46.560 --> 12:51.270
With this attitude, you're gonna be
working here for the rest of your life.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.595
Well, take a gander
into the seat next to you...

12:54.800 --> 12:57.189
...if you wanna see
what your future looks like.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.919
Come, Penelope.

13:05.120 --> 13:08.396
Let's go some place
where they treat us with respect.

13:08.600 --> 13:11.717
Well, try the moon.
You'll weigh less there.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.359
Just a second here, Peg.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.518
Dexter, get the tranquiliser gun.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.280
I'm afraid we're gonna have to tag
and release this one.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.991
Come on, Arnold. We're leaving.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.553
I want a balloon.

13:28.760 --> 13:31.035
You've already got one.

13:34.520 --> 13:38.957
No more. No more.
I can't take any more.

13:39.160 --> 13:42.118
Feeling bad, aren't you, Mr. Bundy?

13:42.320 --> 13:44.436
My coupons.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.151
You are incorrigible.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.193
All right.
I am ready to announce my verdict.

13:51.400 --> 13:54.233
Now, just a second, Judge Cheeto.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.872
Now, I demand equal time.

13:58.080 --> 14:01.072
Speaking of Equal,
you really ought to try some.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.795
I would give you equal time...

14:05.000 --> 14:09.278
...but who would be so loathsome
and horrid as to defend you?

14:09.480 --> 14:11.436
Oh, Al.

14:11.640 --> 14:14.200
Peg, thank God you're here.

14:14.400 --> 14:18.951
Gee, Al, you really are tortured
by your customers.

14:19.160 --> 14:24.029
We are trying to teach this man that his
behaviour towards us is unacceptable.

14:24.240 --> 14:27.232
<i>But a better use of time would be
to teach each other the words:</i>

14:27.440 --> 14:29.556
" No, thank you, I'm full. "

14:31.760 --> 14:33.273
Does he ever stop?

14:33.480 --> 14:34.959
Only in bed.

14:35.160 --> 14:37.720
- But he never really gets started so-
- Peg...

14:37.920 --> 14:41.310
...Peg, tell them about the time
I let your mother come live with us.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.795
I'll take care of this.

14:44.680 --> 14:47.638
You can't believe
how rude he was to her.

14:47.840 --> 14:49.990
So she's big-boned as well.

14:50.680 --> 14:54.992
You know, inside her, there's
a thin woman just dying to get out.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.236
We all say that.

14:57.440 --> 15:00.671
No, there really is.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.754
Last Thanksgiving,
she ate my Aunt Edna.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.950
I told her not to stand
so close to the pies.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.037
That happens.

15:13.560 --> 15:16.711
I lost a kindergarten class that way.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.356
And I'm on trial.

15:27.080 --> 15:31.517
Okay, now brace yourself.
I'm gonna pull it off on three, okay?

15:34.800 --> 15:36.392
Three!

15:39.960 --> 15:43.032
All right.
Should we try the blowtorch again?

15:45.240 --> 15:48.550
Anything but that again.

15:49.240 --> 15:52.357
All right. Well, I still think that
the razor worked the best.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.311
I don't have any eyebrows left.

15:58.720 --> 16:01.359
Sure you do. Here you go.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.878
Look, Dad's gonna be home
any second.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.310
We gotta get these bubbles out.

16:15.320 --> 16:16.799
Fine.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.679
Good, Bud, nice time for a nap.

16:29.120 --> 16:33.511
Bud? Bud, wake up.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.359
Darn it.

16:44.440 --> 16:48.991
Bad Bud. Bad Bud.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.989
Mrs. Bundy,
has your husband ever shown...

16:52.200 --> 16:55.112
...any compassion
towards large women?

16:55.320 --> 17:00.872
<i>Well, he did like that big mom
on What's Happening...</i>

17:02.320 --> 17:04.435
...but then, he even made fun of her.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.436
Traitor!

17:07.560 --> 17:09.198
Al, I'm under oath.

17:09.400 --> 17:13.279
Oath?
You swore on a stack of pancakes.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.435
I've heard enough.

17:15.640 --> 17:20.589
Al Bundy, I find you guilty
of excessive cruelty to large women.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.439
You should see
what he's like with midgets.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.030
The proper term is " little people. "

17:26.240 --> 17:29.949
Well, that's the proper term
for anyone standing next to you.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.758
That's it.

17:34.960 --> 17:40.034
Hey. That's our dinner coupons,
you fat cow.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.438
No, no, no,
we don't like to be called fat.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.029
Then stay home.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.232
You go girl.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.436
Let the punishment begin.

18:07.800 --> 18:11.873
Since it's your birthday and you love
the Jiggly Room so much...

18:12.080 --> 18:15.789
...we decided
to bring the Jiggly Room to you.

18:18.080 --> 18:22.870
But all the wrong things are jiggling.

18:27.120 --> 18:30.556
No, stop. Stop. Stop.

18:31.240 --> 18:35.119
I have a confession to make.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.990
I was once overweight.

18:43.240 --> 18:44.832
Yes, it's true.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.634
I was in my early teens.

18:49.240 --> 18:52.391
" Blubber-Butt Bundy,"
they called me.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.512
They used to stick notes
to the back of my husky pants...

18:55.720 --> 18:59.110
...draw mean pictures of me,
put a cowbell around my neck.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.550
Kids can be so cruel.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.035
Those were my parents.

19:07.760 --> 19:11.673
So I guess what I'm trying to say
is that I make fun of you...

19:13.400 --> 19:16.312
...because I'm trying to deny
my own pain.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.471
Al Bundy, we are dropping
all charges against you.

19:22.680 --> 19:27.549
Thank you,
my metabolically-challenged chums.

19:28.280 --> 19:31.795
In fact,
we are gonna put out the word...

19:32.000 --> 19:35.470
...that Gary's Shoes
is a friend to the large.

19:35.680 --> 19:38.433
Oh, you don't have to do that.

19:39.640 --> 19:45.749
It's just nice to realise that we really
are no different from each other.

19:45.960 --> 19:50.511
You're right. We're exactly the same.

19:50.720 --> 19:55.430
You know,
the only difference is I stopped eating!

19:59.320 --> 20:01.788
Oh, Al, I never knew that about you.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.116
Peg, I lied.

20:04.840 --> 20:08.276
Just like I tell you
your hair isn't ridiculous.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.675
I should be furious at you.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.155
But since it's your birthday,
let's just go home...

20:13.360 --> 20:15.316
<i>...and I'll tuck you in with
some Big 'Uns.</i>

20:15.560 --> 20:20.554
<i>Oh, Peg, my Big 'Uns or yours?</i>

20:21.720 --> 20:22.948
<i>Your Big 'Uns, Al.</i>

20:23.160 --> 20:25.230
Thanks, Peg.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.752
Peg, you know, I gotta tell you...

20:28.960 --> 20:31.918
...spending eight hours
looking at fat women...

20:32.760 --> 20:34.990
...you don't look half bad.

20:35.960 --> 20:39.191
Oh, honey.

20:39.560 --> 20:42.199
Oh, Al.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.233
Oh, Peg.

20:49.440 --> 20:52.671
Oh, Lance.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.911
How did you replace
Dad's window so fast?

21:07.120 --> 21:08.838
Jefferson, get out of the tanning bed.

21:09.040 --> 21:12.191
Someone stole the window
to my Mercedes.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.595
Happy birthday!

21:19.280 --> 21:21.157
Hey, thanks, kids.

21:21.360 --> 21:24.796
Hey, this turned out to be
a pretty great birthday after all.
