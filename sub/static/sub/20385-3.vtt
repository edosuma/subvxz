35:49.681 --> 35:50.882
You got any coke?

35:50.916 --> 35:52.050
It's just, I got nothing.

35:52.083 --> 35:55.153
They're gonna kick me out of
the motel soon, and I just...

35:56.555 --> 35:57.756
Thaddeus, my boy.

35:58.023 --> 35:59.024
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

36:00.892 --> 36:02.361
Why is he here?

36:02.394 --> 36:03.495
What... What are you...

36:03.529 --> 36:04.696
You're not gonna cry, are you?

36:04.730 --> 36:05.731
What? No!

36:06.532 --> 36:08.234
Of course he's not gonna cry.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.503
Thaddeus is a big boy.
He's seen the world.

36:12.404 --> 36:13.672
I want my money!

36:13.705 --> 36:16.508
Well, certainly.
Of course you do.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.410
And, by rights,
you should have it.

36:18.844 --> 36:19.878
But I'm afraid

36:19.911 --> 36:21.280
the rather unfortunate fact
of the matter is,

36:23.249 --> 36:24.583
it's all gone.

36:25.116 --> 36:26.117
What... What?

36:26.585 --> 36:27.886
Told you he's crying.

36:27.919 --> 36:29.255
I... I'm not crying.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.189
Listen to me. Bubee,  relax.

36:31.223 --> 36:33.158
I understand.
These are hard lessons.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.260
But you know what?

36:34.526 --> 36:36.528
You're gonna thank us one day.

36:36.562 --> 36:38.397
Us? What... I...

36:38.430 --> 36:39.931
-I thought we were...
-What?

36:41.233 --> 36:42.234
In love?

36:43.535 --> 36:46.104
I used you, asshole.
Don't you get it?

36:46.137 --> 36:47.939
Harsh. Too harsh, my love.

36:48.574 --> 36:49.941
Let the boy down easy.

36:49.975 --> 36:52.578
Can't you see he has
a genuine fondness for you?

36:52.611 --> 36:54.680
You know, just shut up.
I... I need to think.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.782
What? You need it in Braille?

36:57.749 --> 36:58.784
Nobody asked you to come here

36:58.817 --> 37:00.919
with your stupid face
and your sad eyes.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.421
Love.

37:03.154 --> 37:04.623
You're a piggy bank.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.125
You know what? Uh...

37:07.158 --> 37:08.794
I think it's probably
best if you were to go.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.429
I mean,
she's obviously quite upset.

37:10.462 --> 37:11.963
Don't touch me!

37:11.997 --> 37:12.998
(CRASHING)

37:13.265 --> 37:14.900
Kid, relax.

37:15.166 --> 37:16.802
Come on. It's fine.

37:16.835 --> 37:18.904
I mean, you got played,
that's all.

37:18.937 --> 37:19.938
You're young.

37:19.971 --> 37:21.307
Believe me,
you're gonna get over it.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.874
And you know what?
The truth of the matter is,

37:22.908 --> 37:24.142
we did you a favor.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.512
It's a hard, hard world
out there.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.847
You need to develop
a tougher shell, my friend.

37:29.415 --> 37:31.149
Jesus, Howie.
Just get rid of him already.

37:32.017 --> 37:33.218
-No!
-Kid.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.286
No.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.721
-Kid.
-No.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.255
No! (CHOKING)

37:38.957 --> 37:40.125
(STRAINING)

37:41.327 --> 37:43.028
Everybody's got
a role to play.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.632
Yours is to cough up
the cheddar and then screw.

37:47.933 --> 37:48.934
You understand?

37:49.468 --> 37:50.536
I don't hear you.

37:51.002 --> 37:52.003
Yes!

(COUGHS)

38:02.848 --> 38:04.149
You see that?

38:04.850 --> 38:07.118
Turns out he's reasonable.
He's really a nice kid.

38:07.152 --> 38:08.153

38:10.188 --> 38:12.223

38:28.306 --> 38:29.975
You're a bad person!

38:38.384 --> 38:40.218
I never saw him again.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.722
So, that was the accident.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.224
Zimmerman. You conned him.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.364
Did he... Do you think
Zimmerman would have...

38:52.398 --> 38:56.067
Maybe he wanted revenge
and he hired someone, or he...

39:00.038 --> 39:01.039
(EXHALES)

39:01.540 --> 39:02.541
No.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.012
It's just a story.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.418
None of this has
anything to do with...

39:19.925 --> 39:21.760
Okay. (SIGHS)

39:30.936 --> 39:32.438
He was right.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.274
I am a bad person.

39:39.310 --> 39:41.547
Yet he wasn't so good either.

Okay, folks, in a few minutes,

42:13.732 --> 42:15.834
we'll be beginning our descent
into Minneapolis-Saint Paul

42:15.867 --> 42:18.637
where the temperature
is a balmy 23 degrees.

42:43.895 --> 42:47.766
Unit M-N-S-K-Y.

42:47.799 --> 42:49.100
I can help!

42:49.134 --> 42:52.437
We, the Federation
of United Planets,

42:52.470 --> 42:55.273
want to honor you
for your service.

42:55.306 --> 42:57.442
We downloaded
your data recorder

42:57.475 --> 42:59.544
and found that you
have been functional

42:59.577 --> 43:03.815
for 2.38 million years.

43:03.849 --> 43:06.718
We believe this makes you
the oldest sentient being

43:06.752 --> 43:09.187
in the history
of the universe.

43:11.990 --> 43:14.660
You have seen
the birth of planets,

43:14.693 --> 43:17.262
the death of worlds.

43:17.295 --> 43:19.464
You have ridden on
the tail of a comet,

43:19.497 --> 43:22.300
have journeyed to
the heart of the sun.

43:22.333 --> 43:24.002
Your data will help us

43:24.035 --> 43:27.605
decode the very
fabric of the universe.

43:28.606 --> 43:29.975
I can help!

43:30.475 --> 43:33.011
You have helped,
my metal friend.

43:33.679 --> 43:36.648
But now your
service is complete.

43:36.682 --> 43:40.618
It is time to
shut yourself down.

43:46.524 --> 43:47.859
I can help!

44:44.582 --> 44:45.751
Arby's?

44:46.117 --> 44:47.352
Okay.

44:48.954 --> 44:50.989
You just appear every time
a person says Arby's?

44:51.022 --> 44:52.590
Oh, are you guys
going for Arby's?

44:52.623 --> 44:53.925
Maybe.

44:53.959 --> 44:55.894
Hey, uh, Chief. Old Chief...

44:55.927 --> 44:57.428
You gotta stop
calling me that.

44:57.462 --> 44:59.731
Sorry. Just...
Got a call on the radio.

44:59.765 --> 45:01.833
They've pulled some
prints from Ennis'.

45:01.867 --> 45:03.068
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

45:03.101 --> 45:06.204
Ran it through the...
What do you... Database?

45:06.237 --> 45:07.305
-Got a match.
-You don't say.

45:07.605 --> 45:09.741
Yeah. Maurice LeFay.

45:09.775 --> 45:11.542
Now, that don't sound Russian,

45:11.576 --> 45:13.912
but I showed his photo
to Earl, and he was like,

45:13.945 --> 45:18.283
"Yeah, that's our man,"
so, out of, uh, St. Cloud.

45:19.417 --> 45:21.586
Well, now, what do you know.

45:22.921 --> 45:24.622
We should maybe
drive up there after Arby's.

45:25.156 --> 45:26.257
Dead, apparently.

45:26.657 --> 45:27.759
The... Who?

45:27.793 --> 45:28.794
Suspect. LeFay.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.595
Some kinda freak accident.

45:30.628 --> 45:33.198
Air conditioner fell on him,
just... (WHISTLES)

45:33.231 --> 45:35.100
(SMACKS HANDS TOGETHER)
Like a pancake.

45:35.500 --> 45:37.535
And him on parole for
some pretty nasty stuff, too.

45:37.568 --> 45:38.904
Not in front of the boy.

45:38.937 --> 45:40.806
-Mom, I'm old enough.
-Not even close.

45:41.239 --> 45:42.908
An air conditioner, in winter?

45:43.174 --> 45:44.509
That's what I thought.

45:45.811 --> 45:47.112
Well, if he's dead,
I don't suppose

45:47.145 --> 45:48.279
he's going anywhere.

45:48.780 --> 45:50.048
Probably we should
have a milkshake,

45:50.081 --> 45:52.417
maybe some curly fries,
ponder all future moves.

45:55.086 --> 45:56.487
We may solve this thing yet.
