WEBVTT

00:11.166 --> 00:13.792
EZRA:
Mickey called me.

00:13.875 --> 00:15.291
You told me to trust you.

00:15.375 --> 00:17.250
I meant what I said, Ezra.

00:17.333 --> 00:20.917
There's a price to pay
for the wrong that we do.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.625
A terrible price.
LEE:
My fucking partner

00:22.709 --> 00:24.500
losing his mind!

00:24.583 --> 00:26.083
That's a crisis!

00:26.166 --> 00:28.750
(grunts)
RAY:
I'm gonna ask you once.

00:28.834 --> 00:31.750
Did you hit him?
Yeah. And I don't give a shit.
He's a fucking asshole!

00:31.834 --> 00:33.375
Can I see you again?

00:33.458 --> 00:35.208
Let me make sure you're okay.

00:35.291 --> 00:36.750
I want to taste you.

00:36.834 --> 00:38.208
Fuck.

00:38.291 --> 00:39.875
YOGA INSTRUCTOR:
Inhale.

00:39.959 --> 00:42.458
Gather that anger and
when you exhale, just let it go.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.792
(sobs)

00:43.875 --> 00:45.542
Great guns you got there.

00:45.625 --> 00:48.083
RAY: Call her. She likes you.
It's delicious.

00:48.166 --> 00:49.875
BUNCHY:
My settlement came through.

00:49.959 --> 00:53.166
$1.4 million 'cause some priest
messed around with me

00:53.250 --> 00:55.792
when I was a kid.
LAWYER: This is a Durable Power
of Attorney form.

00:55.875 --> 00:57.291
It means I'm gonna help you.

00:57.375 --> 00:59.709
You think I can't
take care of myself?

00:59.792 --> 01:02.291
What's your name?
Marvin Gaye Washington.

01:02.375 --> 01:04.750
He lives in that house
where they play all that music.

01:04.834 --> 01:07.083
Mom, he's nice.
RE-KON:
His mom's a crack ho,

01:07.166 --> 01:08.959
and she don't do nothing
for the boy.

01:09.041 --> 01:10.834
So I want to get him
emancipated.

01:10.917 --> 01:13.041
I don't even know how something
like that gets arranged.

01:13.125 --> 01:16.083
Signature on a piece of paper.

01:16.166 --> 01:19.291
(screams)
What the fuck's that, Teddy?!
Oh, shit.

01:19.375 --> 01:20.625
LIZA:
Do you ever think
about the things that you do?

01:20.709 --> 01:21.625
Listen...

01:21.709 --> 01:24.250
You bastard!

01:24.333 --> 01:25.750
Hey, hey.

01:25.834 --> 01:26.792
MAN:
Somebody got to somebody.

01:26.875 --> 01:28.291
The chief of police in Boston
just shut down

01:28.375 --> 01:29.208
Mickey's case.

01:29.291 --> 01:30.000
Who the fuck are you?

01:30.083 --> 01:31.750
VAN:
First thing you do

01:31.834 --> 01:33.667
is kill a priest.

01:33.750 --> 01:36.417
I can take care of it.

01:36.500 --> 01:37.959
But you got to work with me.

01:38.041 --> 01:40.041
I want them all: Ezra Goldman,

01:40.125 --> 01:40.750
Lee Drexler

01:40.834 --> 01:43.917
and your boy Ray.

Well, Eddie did exactly
what we wanted him to do.

03:13.166 --> 03:15.417
Yeah? So why's Mickey still
on the street?

03:15.500 --> 03:16.583
Huh?

03:16.667 --> 03:17.291
I paid the guy.

03:17.375 --> 03:19.750
He walked into
the station.

03:19.834 --> 03:20.667
I watched him.
(phone vibrating)

03:20.750 --> 03:22.458
We had him, Ray.

03:22.542 --> 03:24.208
Something went wrong.

03:24.291 --> 03:27.083
Something happened.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.166
Look.

03:30.709 --> 03:33.458
This guy...

03:33.542 --> 03:37.583
Mickey's met with him a couple
of times since Palm Springs.

03:38.792 --> 03:40.709
Doesn't look like a pimp

03:40.792 --> 03:41.792
or a drug dealer. Who is he?

03:41.875 --> 03:44.583
I haven't been able to I.D. him.
That's the thing.

03:44.667 --> 03:45.875
I don't have
anything on him.

03:45.959 --> 03:49.000
It's like he's invisible.

03:49.083 --> 03:51.709
Mickey gets out of prison
five years early,
kills a priest,

03:51.792 --> 03:54.291
nothing happens, and now he's
meeting with this guy?

03:54.375 --> 03:55.709
What, do you think
it could be about us?

03:55.792 --> 03:57.125
(sighs)

03:57.208 --> 04:00.125
Who knows
what the fuck he's up to?

04:06.709 --> 04:08.333
(sighs)

04:09.959 --> 04:12.875
(phone ringing)

04:13.750 --> 04:16.166
LEE:
Where the fuck have you been?

04:16.250 --> 04:17.250
Answer your phone!

04:17.333 --> 04:18.792
What do you want, Lee?

04:18.875 --> 04:19.792
Ezra hasn't shown up.

04:19.875 --> 04:20.834
So call him.
You think I'm a fucking idiot?

04:20.917 --> 04:22.375
He's not picking up.

04:22.458 --> 04:24.875
What makes you think
he'll pick up for me?

04:24.959 --> 04:26.333
Is that supposed to be a joke?

04:26.417 --> 04:28.333
Two of you,
with your fucking secrets.

04:28.417 --> 04:29.417
Get your ass in here, Ray...
(beep)

04:38.542 --> 04:39.667
Did you hear your father
leave this morning?

04:39.750 --> 04:42.542
No.

04:46.458 --> 04:48.125
I'm going to Blake's
house after school.

04:48.208 --> 04:49.041
No way.

04:49.125 --> 04:52.041
You come straight home
from school.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.417
Why?

04:53.500 --> 04:54.333
You know why.

04:54.417 --> 04:58.792
No Xbox, no computer,
no cell phone,

04:58.875 --> 05:01.166
no headphones--
none of that stuff.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.375
Your sister had her heart set

05:02.458 --> 05:05.542
on going to that school
and you ruined

05:05.625 --> 05:07.417
her chances.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.750
Dad didn't say
I was punished.

05:08.834 --> 05:10.667
No?

05:11.125 --> 05:13.834
Well, you are.

05:16.458 --> 05:18.542
You should be in jail,
you little asshole.

05:18.625 --> 05:20.667
You didn't want to go to
that shitty school anyway.

05:21.792 --> 05:24.792
(knocking)

05:28.291 --> 05:32.709
What are you doing?
Go away.

05:32.792 --> 05:34.125
Hey.
Would you get out of here.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.458
I've got to go to school.

05:35.542 --> 05:36.542
School? What?
(scoffs)

05:36.625 --> 05:39.083
What can you learn there
that I can't teach you?

05:39.166 --> 05:41.250
Get out of here. Okay?

05:41.333 --> 05:44.166
Go. Please?
(whimpers):
No... no...

05:44.250 --> 05:45.750
I'm sorry.

05:45.834 --> 05:48.625
Bye.

05:48.709 --> 05:50.583
(Terry breathing rapidly
through nose)

05:50.667 --> 05:53.583

TERRY:
Oh, God.

05:53.667 --> 05:56.083
(Frances exhales)
(Terry grunts, pants)

05:58.166 --> 06:00.834
(Frances laughs)
(Terry chuckles)

06:07.000 --> 06:10.667
Oh, God.
(sighs)

06:10.750 --> 06:12.750
Jesus Christ.
You're gonna kill me.

06:12.834 --> 06:16.458
(chuckles)

06:16.542 --> 06:19.583
This is getting harder
to take, you know?

06:19.667 --> 06:20.959
What is?

06:21.041 --> 06:23.208
Having her  here.

06:23.291 --> 06:25.000
I'm jealous.

06:25.083 --> 06:27.041
I told you...

06:27.125 --> 06:27.667
she's dead.

06:27.750 --> 06:31.125
Good.

06:32.375 --> 06:35.333
Is there anyone
I need to worry about?

06:35.417 --> 06:38.375
No.
(chuckles)

06:43.041 --> 06:44.458
Oh, God.

06:44.542 --> 06:46.875
(sighs)

07:00.166 --> 07:02.083
I wish you could stay
a little longer.

07:02.166 --> 07:03.875
Why? Are you ready
for round three?

07:03.959 --> 07:04.959
Maybe.

07:05.041 --> 07:08.625
That sounds wonderful,
but some of us have got

07:08.709 --> 07:10.792
jobs to go to.
I got a job.

07:10.875 --> 07:12.208
I'm just joking with you, Terry.

07:12.291 --> 07:15.542
Don't take everything to heart.

07:29.417 --> 07:31.917
Can I see you later?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.583
Maybe.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.583
(chuckles)
Maybe.

07:48.417 --> 07:52.625
Last time I was in a bank,
I had a stocking on my face.

07:54.959 --> 07:57.500
Here.

07:58.458 --> 07:59.875
We're depositing this.

08:03.792 --> 08:07.542
Sir, this is a check
for $1.4 million.

08:07.625 --> 08:10.208
That's right.
My boy's a millionaire.

08:10.291 --> 08:11.417
He earned it.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.500
The hard way.
(chuckles)

08:13.583 --> 08:17.041
And you sure you want to deposit
it all into a checking account?

08:17.125 --> 08:17.917
Yeah. For now.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.458
I think I need
to speak with my manager.

08:19.542 --> 08:22.083
Just do it already.
It's his money.

08:22.166 --> 08:23.291
What the fuck?

08:26.083 --> 08:27.083
Pop, I need a little cash.

08:27.166 --> 08:29.750
How much?

08:29.834 --> 08:31.625
I don't know. 50 bucks?

08:31.709 --> 08:34.458
50 bucks? You can't get
a blow job for 50 bucks.

08:34.542 --> 08:36.166
You. Come here.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.125
Give him $200.

08:38.208 --> 08:39.375
Make it in tens.

08:39.458 --> 08:41.375
Um...

08:41.458 --> 08:43.792
It's real-- the check
is fucking real.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.875
Ezra, where the hell are you?

08:54.959 --> 08:56.875
We need to talk.

08:56.959 --> 08:58.875
I think something's going down.

09:33.542 --> 09:34.750

to walk home, Bunch.

09:34.834 --> 09:37.208
I got something to do.

09:37.291 --> 09:40.875
But I thought we were gonna
go look at bicycles.

09:40.959 --> 09:42.834
What are you, ten?

09:42.917 --> 09:44.750
Pick your own bicycle.

09:47.417 --> 09:49.291
Jesus.

CONOR: Mom said I was punished
for hitting that kid, but...

10:53.667 --> 10:55.417
Know what? She's right.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.542
When you hit someone on the
head, there are consequences.

10:56.625 --> 10:59.208
But it's not fair!
He was a douche...

10:59.291 --> 11:00.291
But nothing.

11:00.375 --> 11:01.792
Be a man; deal with it.

sometimes when you're...

11:23.083 --> 11:24.417

11:24.500 --> 11:27.417
Let me call you right back.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.333
Surprise.

11:52.417 --> 11:55.458
Jesus, Ray, you are not
an easy man to find.

11:55.542 --> 11:57.625
What the hell are
you doing here?

11:57.709 --> 11:59.792
(sighs)
I think he broke some ribs.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.333
Who?

12:03.083 --> 12:05.458
Wow.

12:05.542 --> 12:07.333
Great place, Ray.

12:09.208 --> 12:11.125
What's with the gun?

12:11.208 --> 12:14.041
You need to leave. Now.

12:14.125 --> 12:15.625
Mm-mm.

12:15.709 --> 12:19.625
I'm not leaving here
until you fuck me.

12:19.709 --> 12:20.875
No, no, don't do that.

12:20.959 --> 12:22.291
(phone vibrating)
Put your fucking sh...

(phone vibrating)

12:31.583 --> 12:34.875
Yeah, Deb, what's up?

12:34.959 --> 12:35.375
Ezra's had a car accident.

12:35.458 --> 12:38.458
We're at Cedars.

12:38.542 --> 12:39.875
Is he all right?

12:39.959 --> 12:40.917
I don't know yet.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.875
I'll be right there.

12:54.208 --> 12:56.208
(moans)

12:56.291 --> 12:57.375
What the fuck
are you doing?

13:00.291 --> 13:01.834
Where's the key?

13:01.917 --> 13:02.709
What key?

13:02.792 --> 13:04.875
Come on, Ashley,
stop fooling around.

13:04.959 --> 13:06.083
Where's the key?

13:06.166 --> 13:09.917
Oh, you mean this key?

13:11.125 --> 13:12.166
Oh, shit!

13:12.250 --> 13:14.458
(toilet flushes)

13:14.542 --> 13:15.917
Fuck.

13:18.959 --> 13:20.208
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

13:20.291 --> 13:23.709
Fuck me, Ray.

13:23.792 --> 13:26.834
Save me, Ray.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.959
If you leave, I'll scream.

13:36.125 --> 13:36.959
(screaming)

13:40.959 --> 13:42.834
(R&B music playing loudly)

13:42.917 --> 13:44.041
(screaming continues)

13:51.959 --> 13:53.041
What happened?

13:53.125 --> 13:54.667
Oh, my God.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.583
He called me from the
road early this morning.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.917
He said he had
an accident.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.458
I came to pick him up,

14:00.542 --> 14:01.583
he's confused.

14:01.667 --> 14:02.875
His car's nowhere to be seen.

14:02.959 --> 14:04.750
Is he okay?

14:04.834 --> 14:05.417
Okay? No, he's not okay.

14:05.500 --> 14:06.500
He's losing it, Ray.

14:06.583 --> 14:07.792
You know what he said?

14:07.875 --> 14:10.750
He said he was
looking for his cat.

14:10.834 --> 14:13.375
He hasn't had a cat in 40 years.

14:13.458 --> 14:15.083
Where is he?

14:15.166 --> 14:16.834
(mechanical thumping, whirring)

14:16.917 --> 14:17.917
Help!

14:18.000 --> 14:19.250
Help me!

14:19.333 --> 14:20.917
I'm being buried alive.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.458
(over speaker):
The banging in my head...

14:22.542 --> 14:24.792
Please, stop the banging!

14:24.875 --> 14:26.458
We need to get him
out of there.

14:26.542 --> 14:27.750
Can we speak to him?

14:27.834 --> 14:28.041
TECHNICIAN: Sure.

14:30.291 --> 14:31.500
It's all right, Ezra.

14:31.583 --> 14:34.250
Try to take it easy.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.291
(over speaker):
You'll be out of there
in no time.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.709
Raymond?

14:37.792 --> 14:38.458
Ray, is that you?

14:38.542 --> 14:39.625
Yeah, it's me.

14:39.709 --> 14:41.458
Thank God you're here.

14:41.542 --> 14:44.000
Take a deep breath.

14:44.083 --> 14:44.375
You're gonna be okay.

14:44.458 --> 14:47.000
I'm here.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.333
Ray, hold my watch
and my ring for me.

14:53.417 --> 14:55.208
They're all thieves.

14:55.291 --> 14:56.417
You're going home, Ezra.

14:56.500 --> 14:59.375
I don't know that.

15:01.166 --> 15:02.000
What happened?

15:04.709 --> 15:06.083
I hit someone, Ray.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.625
You what?

15:07.709 --> 15:09.125
I fucking hit someone.

15:09.208 --> 15:09.542
Are you sure?

15:09.625 --> 15:11.291
Yes, I'm sure.

15:11.375 --> 15:12.667
I dragged his body to the car

15:12.750 --> 15:14.250
and put him in the trunk.

15:14.333 --> 15:15.458
Did anyone see you?

15:16.375 --> 15:18.542
Where did this happen?
How should I know?

15:18.625 --> 15:20.166
It was dark.

15:20.250 --> 15:22.000
Where's the car, Ezra?
What car?

15:22.083 --> 15:22.458
Your car.

15:22.542 --> 15:25.083
Calm down, Ray.

15:25.166 --> 15:26.667
You seem tense.

15:26.750 --> 15:29.542
You should get a massage.

15:30.375 --> 15:32.875
Call me when you
get the results.

15:38.083 --> 15:38.333
Abby.

15:38.417 --> 15:40.667
Right?

15:40.750 --> 15:41.834
It's Nomi.

15:41.917 --> 15:42.417
We were just
in class together.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.333
Oh, hey.

15:44.417 --> 15:46.000
Do you mind
if I sit down?

15:46.083 --> 15:47.834
No, of course, please.

15:47.917 --> 15:51.667
Gosh, how much do you
just love Jeremiah's class?

15:51.750 --> 15:53.083
Yeah, he's great.

15:55.375 --> 15:58.542
I've seen you crying
a couple times.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.792
I'm...

16:01.875 --> 16:03.709
I'm a life coach,

16:03.792 --> 16:05.750
so I'm really attuned
to people's energies.

16:05.834 --> 16:08.875
That's interesting.

16:08.959 --> 16:10.875
Lena, Ezra had an accident
last night.

16:10.959 --> 16:11.750
I think they towed his car
off Mulholland.

16:11.834 --> 16:14.333
We need to find it.

16:14.417 --> 16:16.041
Okay, boss.

16:16.125 --> 16:17.709
Where have you been?

16:17.792 --> 16:19.542
And where's my partner?

16:19.625 --> 16:21.208
Something came up.
What?

16:21.291 --> 16:22.291
What came up?

16:22.375 --> 16:24.083
Nothing; he's fine.

16:24.166 --> 16:25.709
Bullshit.
He's out of his mind.

16:25.792 --> 16:27.792
He's a liability, Ray...

16:27.875 --> 16:31.291
the way he's been behaving;
which makes you a liability.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.875
And what's with
your fucking kid?

16:34.959 --> 16:37.083
Smashes Feldman's kid in the
head with a football tee?

16:37.166 --> 16:38.291
Six stitches.

16:38.375 --> 16:38.917
What are you raising,
an animal?

16:39.000 --> 16:40.417
Maybe I should hire him.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.709
You done?

16:41.792 --> 16:44.625
No, no, I'm not done.

16:44.709 --> 16:47.041
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't fire you, Ray.

16:47.125 --> 16:49.500
I'm not the kind of guy
you fire.

16:49.583 --> 16:51.792
(clears throat)

16:51.875 --> 16:53.125
Let's do this.

16:58.750 --> 17:00.709
Where's Goldman?

17:00.792 --> 17:02.125
I'm in charge today.

17:02.208 --> 17:03.417
Who's this guy?

17:03.500 --> 17:04.625
You'll see.

17:21.834 --> 17:24.834
I heard you two
already met.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.458
Too bad I couldn't
be there, Ray.

17:31.709 --> 17:33.959
(groans)

17:34.041 --> 17:35.208
(music blaring in distance)

17:38.333 --> 17:41.041
(sighs, clears throat)

17:41.125 --> 17:43.458
It's okay.

17:43.542 --> 17:46.458
You're in the solution now.

17:46.542 --> 17:48.083
You're in the solution...

17:48.166 --> 17:49.291
You're in the solution.

17:55.625 --> 17:56.458
(inhales deeply)

17:56.542 --> 18:00.166
(sighs)

18:17.625 --> 18:18.583
(gasps)

18:18.667 --> 18:21.417
Damn it.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.375
Ow.

18:26.750 --> 18:28.834
(groans)

18:48.834 --> 18:50.709
(sighs)

18:50.792 --> 18:52.542
I'm worried about Conor.

18:52.625 --> 18:54.208
That's my son.

18:54.291 --> 18:57.208
He hit a kid
with a football tee,

18:57.291 --> 18:58.792
and then he lied about it.

18:58.875 --> 18:59.875
Wow.

18:59.959 --> 19:01.166
(sighs)

19:01.250 --> 19:01.709
And your daughter?

19:01.792 --> 19:03.792
Bridget?

19:03.875 --> 19:05.375
She's fine.

19:05.458 --> 19:06.542
She's a good kid.

19:06.625 --> 19:07.041
What about your husband?

19:07.125 --> 19:10.542
He's a good guy.

19:10.625 --> 19:13.959
How long you guys
been married?

19:14.041 --> 19:15.375
18 years.

19:17.625 --> 19:19.083
We met in high school.

19:19.166 --> 19:20.291
I was friends

19:20.375 --> 19:21.542
with his sister.

19:21.625 --> 19:22.041
Is he a good husband?

19:22.125 --> 19:23.709
How do you mean?

19:23.792 --> 19:26.375
You know, is he, um,

19:26.458 --> 19:27.208
emotionally supportive?

19:27.291 --> 19:30.792
He didn't say good-bye
this morning.

19:30.875 --> 19:33.291
That must have been
really hurtful, Abby.

19:34.834 --> 19:37.125
You're kidding, right?

19:37.208 --> 19:39.417
No, I'm not.

19:39.500 --> 19:42.250
You know, in my practice,
I learned that

19:42.333 --> 19:43.917
men are naturally

19:44.000 --> 19:46.083
really secretive animals.

19:46.166 --> 19:47.750
You know, they take things back

19:47.834 --> 19:49.291
into their caves,
and they hide them.

19:51.250 --> 19:53.709
Yeah, Ray's kind of like that.

19:53.792 --> 19:54.917
That bother you?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.709
Lots of things bother me.

19:56.792 --> 19:59.208
Like what?

20:03.125 --> 20:06.250
Have you told him
how you feel?

20:06.333 --> 20:09.625
Have you made
your feelings known?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.583
Is he the reason
you've been crying?

20:11.667 --> 20:14.792
What are you, my fucking priest?

20:14.875 --> 20:17.792
Wait, don't-don't you want
to lead a heart-centered life?

20:22.333 --> 20:23.542
I gotta go.

20:23.625 --> 20:25.166
You're a nosy cunt.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.125
(clears throat)

20:44.792 --> 20:47.625
Whew.

20:47.709 --> 20:49.709
Raleigh Chopper Mark 2?

20:49.792 --> 20:52.709
Ape hangers, bobbed fenders.

20:52.792 --> 20:55.041
Yep.

20:55.125 --> 20:56.667
That's the one.

20:56.750 --> 20:59.083
Whew, shit's nice.

21:03.083 --> 21:05.959
(classical music playing)

21:19.458 --> 21:20.583
(car approaching)

21:25.458 --> 21:27.333
DEB:
Darling...

21:27.417 --> 21:29.417
are you expecting someone?

21:29.500 --> 21:30.375
Who is it?

21:33.750 --> 21:34.792
You want me
to send him away?

21:34.875 --> 21:38.500
No.

21:45.875 --> 21:47.041
Mickey Donovan.

21:47.125 --> 21:49.625
I know who you are.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.583
You've been tormenting me.

21:52.834 --> 21:55.667
Come in.

21:59.125 --> 22:01.125
Beautiful place you got.

22:01.208 --> 22:03.500
Quite a spread.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.250
Thank you.

22:05.333 --> 22:07.041
BOBBY:
You think this is what

22:07.125 --> 22:09.166
she really looks like?

22:09.250 --> 22:10.250
You should see
her high school yearbook.

22:10.333 --> 22:12.417
A dog wouldn't hump her.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.375
You didn't seem to mind
when I had my tits done.
You should see our kids.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.875
They're fucking hideous.
Oh, you're disgusting.

22:16.959 --> 22:17.875
Does the guy you're fucking

22:17.959 --> 22:18.583
know what you used to look like?

22:18.667 --> 22:20.875
Does your penis pump still work?

22:20.959 --> 22:21.792
(phone vibrates)
You want that, too?

22:21.875 --> 22:22.875
Yeah, you douche.
Okay, write that down!

22:22.959 --> 22:25.834
One used penis pump,

22:25.917 --> 22:27.500
barely used, almost new!

22:27.583 --> 22:29.583
MICKEY:
My son is my son.

22:29.667 --> 22:32.125
He did what he thought
he had to do.

22:32.208 --> 22:34.125
You, you're a piece of shit.

22:34.208 --> 22:35.792
How's it feel

22:35.875 --> 22:37.917
to send an innocent man away
for 20 years?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.750
It feels terrible.

22:40.834 --> 22:41.959
It's haunted me.

22:42.041 --> 22:43.542
Why'd you do it, then?

22:43.625 --> 22:44.125
Oh, Mickey.

22:44.208 --> 22:46.291
The choices you make.

22:46.375 --> 22:47.542
I was younger.

22:47.625 --> 22:49.291
We all were.

22:49.375 --> 22:50.834
Besides,

22:50.917 --> 22:53.125
Sean shot the girl
with your gun.

22:53.208 --> 22:55.417
High on your drugs.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.792
Ray said you were
in trouble anyway.

22:57.875 --> 22:59.291
You'd stolen a lot of money
from Sully.

22:59.375 --> 23:01.375
You'd be dead
if it weren't for us.

23:01.458 --> 23:04.291
(scoffs softly)

23:04.375 --> 23:06.542
Tell me one true thing, Ezra.

23:10.875 --> 23:14.083
We all die.

23:16.583 --> 23:18.709
Ain't that the truth.

23:24.291 --> 23:26.417
Maybe you're right.

23:28.750 --> 23:32.542
Once I took Sully's money,
I was a dead man.

23:32.625 --> 23:34.041
So why'd you do it?

23:34.125 --> 23:37.500
I did it for this chick,
Claudette,

23:37.583 --> 23:39.959
my one true love.

23:40.041 --> 23:42.417
The other one,

23:42.500 --> 23:44.000
we had four kids.

23:44.083 --> 23:45.125
I felt bad when she died,

23:45.208 --> 23:48.417
but Claudette was it for me.

23:53.208 --> 23:54.959
You ever been with a black girl?

23:55.041 --> 23:55.792
Once.

23:55.875 --> 23:58.500
1968.

23:58.583 --> 24:00.625
Democratic National Convention.

24:04.458 --> 24:06.709
Ruth was my one true love,

24:06.792 --> 24:09.750
the only one
I ever really loved.

24:21.083 --> 24:23.000
Look at Ray.

24:23.083 --> 24:24.458
Big shot.

24:24.542 --> 24:27.250
I thoughthat was gonna be
my life.

24:27.333 --> 24:31.208
What the fuck happened?

24:32.792 --> 24:36.625
We're not going above
ten million, bottom line.

24:36.709 --> 24:39.208
He's cheap, abusive,

24:39.291 --> 24:40.417
sadistic.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.583
A lousy fuck.

24:41.667 --> 24:42.542
My client deserves

24:42.625 --> 24:43.250
double that, and you know it.

24:43.333 --> 24:46.208
Fuck you.
Fuck you!

24:47.959 --> 24:49.375
Is this the best
you can do?

24:52.083 --> 24:54.166
(sighs)

24:55.875 --> 24:57.875
I need to talk to you.

24:57.959 --> 24:59.583
Can we step out?

25:15.333 --> 25:16.834
You know who I am.

25:16.917 --> 25:18.000
You know what I do.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.667
The amount of money
you're fighting for isn't worth

25:19.750 --> 25:22.542
the pain they're gonna make me
put you through.

25:24.458 --> 25:27.041
I can't imagine
anyone making you do anything.

25:35.625 --> 25:38.000
He knows you're
fucking someone else.

25:38.083 --> 25:39.917
What he doesn't know
is it's his brother.

25:41.959 --> 25:45.125
You accept their offer,
I go away.

25:45.208 --> 25:47.417
You don't...

25:47.500 --> 25:48.667
it gets worse.

25:59.375 --> 26:01.458
(sniffs)

26:11.208 --> 26:14.041
(sighs)

26:27.333 --> 26:29.542
LEE: What the fuck
did you say to her?

26:29.625 --> 26:31.500
Did you see her face?

26:34.417 --> 26:36.291

with Ezra.

26:36.375 --> 26:37.333
I'm worried, you know?

26:37.417 --> 26:38.834
I just want you to know

26:38.917 --> 26:42.333
that you can come to me directly
with anything

26:42.417 --> 26:44.125
at any time.

26:46.417 --> 26:49.000
You coming on to me, Lee?

26:50.667 --> 26:52.792
Fuck you, funny guy.

26:52.875 --> 26:54.625
Get your ass

26:54.709 --> 26:55.792
down to Compton.

26:55.875 --> 26:57.125
Marvin Gaye's mom

26:57.208 --> 26:59.291
didn't send the papers;
I think Ezra

26:59.375 --> 27:01.041
would like you to
finish the job.

27:01.125 --> 27:02.542
I'd check with him,
but I can't seem

27:02.625 --> 27:04.333
to find him.

27:04.417 --> 27:06.667
God, don't be
such a fucktard, Bridg.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.875
Mom, will you tell him?

28:35.000 --> 28:37.917

28:38.000 --> 28:39.625

I come over to you?

28:43.041 --> 28:44.959

28:51.291 --> 28:53.041
Bye-bye, Terry.

29:15.959 --> 29:17.375
You're scaring me, Ray.

29:17.458 --> 29:18.834
What did I bring the van for?

29:18.917 --> 29:21.166
I got a dead body in the trunk
of a Mercedes.

29:21.250 --> 29:22.834
Jesus fucking Chr...!

29:22.917 --> 29:24.667
You're killing me, man.

29:24.750 --> 29:25.333
This is nuts.

29:25.417 --> 29:27.291
Are you serious?

29:27.375 --> 29:29.291
Get your badge out.

29:31.083 --> 29:33.000
How are you?

29:33.083 --> 29:36.542
There was this guy, Georgie,
I hung with in prison.

29:36.625 --> 29:39.667
Thought he ran the joint.

29:39.750 --> 29:42.625
We're in the cafeteria,

29:42.709 --> 29:43.917
beating the Christ
out of some guy,

29:44.000 --> 29:47.834
and I see this guard
come over from behind,

29:47.917 --> 29:50.750
and he cracks Georgie over
the head with a stick,

29:50.834 --> 29:52.083
and his fucking eye pops out.

29:52.166 --> 29:53.750
I could've caught it
in my hand.

29:53.834 --> 29:56.375
That changed
my whole perspective.

29:56.458 --> 29:58.375
I... I thought to myself,
"I got to get through this.

29:58.458 --> 29:59.208
"I got to get through this.

29:59.291 --> 30:01.250
"I'm on the straight

30:01.333 --> 30:03.250

What do you need, boys?"

30:03.333 --> 30:05.792
You know how I
got through it?

30:05.875 --> 30:08.000
I put everyone away.

30:08.083 --> 30:11.709
You know why, Ezra?

30:11.792 --> 30:13.709
I know who holds the stick.

30:13.792 --> 30:14.625
What stick?

30:14.709 --> 30:17.959
Why do you need
a stick?

30:18.041 --> 30:18.458
What do you want?

30:18.542 --> 30:20.834
I don't know yet.

30:20.917 --> 30:21.959
I'm working on it.

30:33.041 --> 30:36.041
Who are you?

30:36.125 --> 30:38.750

30:38.834 --> 30:39.875

41:31.792 --> 41:32.959
You're lying!

41:33.041 --> 41:34.417
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
get over here.

41:34.500 --> 41:35.709
Get over here.
Ow! You're hurting me!

41:35.792 --> 41:36.750
Now listen to me.

41:36.834 --> 41:38.375
Say one more
fucking thing,

41:38.458 --> 41:39.917
and I'm gonna knock you
into next Tuesday.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.583
You can't hit me.

41:41.667 --> 41:42.625
I have epilepsy.

41:45.458 --> 41:48.208
(gasps)

41:48.291 --> 41:50.709
Ow...
Fucking warned you.

42:04.542 --> 42:07.000
Mom, come on, let's go.
Hurry up.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.667
FRANCES:
Just hold on.

42:16.667 --> 42:18.166
Did somebody turn
off the heat?

42:18.250 --> 42:19.458
BOY:
Yes...

42:19.542 --> 42:20.750
Hello?
Yes.

42:20.834 --> 42:22.583
Yes?

42:22.667 --> 42:24.834
(sighs)

42:26.041 --> 42:28.375
(engine starts)

42:43.083 --> 42:44.709
MAN:
Wait until you see this place.

42:48.917 --> 42:50.834
It's not even
listed yet.

42:55.375 --> 42:57.291
This place is great.

42:57.375 --> 42:59.417
A good investment.

42:59.500 --> 43:01.792
A mister like you
need a nice house.

43:01.875 --> 43:03.166
You like it?

43:04.208 --> 43:05.458
It suits you.

43:05.542 --> 43:06.750
You look good here.

43:06.834 --> 43:08.542
You think?

43:08.625 --> 43:10.000
Sure.

43:10.083 --> 43:12.500
You got money, right?

43:22.709 --> 43:24.333
We have to talk, Ezra.
We got a problem.

43:24.417 --> 43:27.583
Your father's been here.

43:27.667 --> 43:29.709
We had a nice chat.

43:29.792 --> 43:31.959
What are you talking about?

43:32.041 --> 43:33.625
He was here this afternoon.

43:33.709 --> 43:34.083
He's a nice man.

43:34.166 --> 43:35.375
I like him.

43:35.458 --> 43:37.458
What did you talk about?

43:37.542 --> 43:41.000
Things that matter: life, love.

43:41.083 --> 43:43.333
Stop.

43:43.417 --> 43:47.500
Just... fucking stop.

43:52.709 --> 43:55.750
Listen to me, Ezra, please.

43:55.834 --> 43:58.417
This is important.

43:58.500 --> 43:59.750
What did you say to him?

44:05.250 --> 44:06.375
I don't remember.

44:06.458 --> 44:07.208
You don't have a fucking choice.

44:07.291 --> 44:09.875
You have to remember.

44:09.959 --> 44:11.208
I can't.

44:11.291 --> 44:14.625
I have a brain tumor.

44:14.709 --> 44:16.542
I'm dying, Raymond.

Sandra, what can you tell us?

SANDRA: Well, Bob,
a search is underway

47:02.083 --> 47:04.458
for suspects after a deadly
double shooting in Compton.

47:04.542 --> 47:06.542
Police arrived to find
two bodies on the 300 block

47:06.625 --> 47:09.000
of East 151st Street today.

47:09.083 --> 47:12.917
The identities of the victims
have not been released.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.417
It is unclear whether
the shooting is gang-related.

47:15.500 --> 47:17.959
Homicide detectives
are investigating,

47:18.041 --> 47:21.250
and anyone with information
is asked to please contact

47:21.333 --> 47:24.667
the Los Angeles County

47:24.750 --> 47:27.625
You know, Bob, after several
years of declining crime rates

47:27.709 --> 47:29.542
in the city, this will be

47:29.625 --> 47:31.125
