00:00.100 --> 00:02.385
<i>Previously on "zero hour"...</i>

00:02.420 --> 00:03.880
Where is she?
What are you doing?

00:03.915 --> 00:05.587
The clocks-
did she take them?

00:05.622 --> 00:07.225
My wife lied to me
for five years,

00:07.260 --> 00:10.620
The clocks-they're a map
to the true cross of christ.

00:10.655 --> 00:13.980
The shepherds have struggled
to protect the cross

00:14.015 --> 00:15.877
From a group known
as the pyrates.

00:15.912 --> 00:18.066
I saw something
I can't explain.

00:18.101 --> 00:20.520
Do we have any family
in germany?

00:20.555 --> 00:22.547
What do we tell him?
Nothing... Yet.

00:22.582 --> 00:24.361
- We got a name.
- Korbin sturm.

00:24.396 --> 00:26.105
Was conscripted
into the nazi party

00:26.140 --> 00:28.425
For field research on something
called zero hour.

00:28.460 --> 00:32.740
The expedition was looking for
the secret of life and death.

00:32.775 --> 00:35.500
Project zero hour
didn't die with the nazis.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.260
You want to know
what laila found here.

00:37.295 --> 00:39.060
She found you.

00:39.095 --> 00:41.905
Hey! Aah!

00:41.940 --> 00:44.360
We're done!
You will stay forever blind

00:44.395 --> 00:46.780
To the truth
about what you really are.

<i>5 is the number of grace.</i>

00:57.720 --> 01:00.165
<i>The father and the son.</i>

01:00.200 --> 01:05.720
<i>But if either is a lie,
then all is a doubt.</i>

01:11.360 --> 01:14.480
What you are
witnessing is the lord's wrath,

01:14.515 --> 01:17.725
But it's not directed at you.

01:17.760 --> 01:20.400
The record number
of tsunamis this year-

01:20.435 --> 01:22.685
Not directed at you.

01:22.720 --> 01:25.760
Earthquakes,
more measured above 7.5

01:25.795 --> 01:27.520
Than at any point in history-

01:27.555 --> 01:29.760
Not directed at you.

01:29.795 --> 01:31.137
The rapture?

01:31.172 --> 01:32.946
It's begun?

01:32.981 --> 01:34.685
When it does,

01:34.720 --> 01:38.165
You will not need to ask.

01:38.200 --> 01:42.500
He's giving us a sign
that we're on the right path.

01:42.535 --> 01:46.765
For 2,000 years,
god's waited for us to evolve,

01:46.800 --> 01:51.760
To have the capability
to deliver upon his prophecy.

01:53.520 --> 01:56.165
And once we find the cross,

01:56.200 --> 01:58.320
That's exactly
what we're going to do.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.925
Special agent rebecca riley,

02:00.960 --> 02:02.080
Medevaced in
from south america.

02:02.115 --> 02:03.165
Vital signs are stable.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.840
Gunshot wound
to the right shoulder.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.717
B.P. Is 100 over 60.
Pulse, 54.

02:07.752 --> 02:10.560
Sir, you'll have to
wait out here.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.365
<i>And now
from our affiliate in miami,</i>

02:16.400 --> 02:22.440
<i>I'm here in key west,
where the eye of hurricane alex</i>

02:22.475 --> 02:25.005
Hit in the early morning hours.

02:25.040 --> 02:29.080
<i>And its effects are devastating
here on the florida coast.</i>

02:29.115 --> 02:30.685
<i>Take a look behind me.</i>

02:30.720 --> 02:32.685
<i>You can see the streets
are flooded,</i>

02:32.720 --> 02:34.925
<i>The trees are toppled,
power lines are down.</i>

02:34.960 --> 02:36.760
<i>Residents who weren't able
to escape before the storm...</i>

02:36.795 --> 02:38.805
She's awake.
You can see her now.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.800
<i>Are now trying to flee.
They are...</i>

02:44.240 --> 02:46.600
Vincent didn't just swim
out of paraguay.

02:46.635 --> 02:48.960
Either he's in the air
or he's on the ground.

02:48.995 --> 02:50.885
Find him.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.280
This thing called "recovery,"

02:52.315 --> 02:54.925
Have you heard of it?

02:54.960 --> 02:56.720
So you wanna tell me
what happened out there

02:56.755 --> 02:58.165
Between you and vincent?

02:58.200 --> 03:02.160
All that stuff he was shouting
about brotherhood?

03:02.195 --> 03:04.480
"find out
who you really are"?

03:07.680 --> 03:12.560
You know, for someone
on a quest for the true cross,

03:12.595 --> 03:15.480
Vincent sure seems
real interested in you.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.262
Glad you could join us.

03:21.297 --> 03:22.885
Any word from hank?

03:22.920 --> 03:24.480
Yeah. Beck's doing fine,
so he's on his way back.

03:24.490 --> 03:26.575
So how'd it go last night?

03:26.610 --> 03:29.090
Yeah, we just grabbed
a bite, you know?

03:29.125 --> 03:31.570
Tossed around
a few conspiracy theories.

03:31.605 --> 03:33.095
Sounds romantic.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.090
It wasn't a date.
We were working.

03:35.125 --> 03:37.295
On what?

03:37.330 --> 03:39.810
On what's so important
about the true cross.

03:39.845 --> 03:42.290
I mean, there's lots
of relics out there.

03:42.325 --> 03:44.615
Like the spear of destiny,

03:44.650 --> 03:46.690
Which supposedly
pierced the heart of jesus-

03:46.725 --> 03:48.730
That's-that's just sitting
in some museum

03:48.765 --> 03:50.095
In vienna somewhere.

03:50.130 --> 03:53.690
No one's killing folks trying
to get their hands on that.

03:53.725 --> 03:57.770
So why the cross?

04:13.170 --> 04:14.895
Are you okay?

04:14.930 --> 04:17.495
Yes, father. Why wouldn't I be?

04:17.529 --> 04:20.334
Must have been hard
to leave someone

04:20.370 --> 04:23.170
You've spent every day with
for the last five years.

04:23.205 --> 04:27.450
I... I just
feel bad for hank.

04:27.485 --> 04:28.975
I broke his heart.

04:29.010 --> 04:32.010
Laila galliston
broke his heart.

04:32.045 --> 04:35.010
You were doing
what you had to do...

04:35.045 --> 04:36.850
In service.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.815
Well, it's over now.

04:40.850 --> 04:43.250
We have the clocks.
The cross is safe, right?

04:46.690 --> 04:47.935
What is it?

04:47.970 --> 04:50.575
The elders have spoken.

04:50.610 --> 04:53.890
They've decided it's time
to complete the chain.

04:53.925 --> 04:56.130
Follow the clocks
to the cross

04:56.165 --> 04:57.610
And move it.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.535
Why?

04:59.570 --> 05:02.530
You think hank won't continue
coming for you,

05:02.565 --> 05:03.615
Asking questions?

05:03.650 --> 05:05.335
He's seen too much now.

05:05.370 --> 05:07.730
It's only a matter of time
before the pyrates

05:07.765 --> 05:10.615
Figure out a way
to get to him.

05:10.650 --> 05:13.650
We have no choice
but to move the cross.

05:13.685 --> 05:16.415
Not just for our sake...

05:16.450 --> 05:18.930
For the sake
of all humanity.

05:21.090 --> 05:22.610
Laila's following
the clocks to the cross,

05:22.645 --> 05:24.175
And we can't do anything
to stop her.

05:24.210 --> 05:27.055
I can't believe the entire
flight home from germany,

05:27.090 --> 05:29.490
He had the clock in his hand,
and he didn't even look at it.

05:29.525 --> 05:31.770
Yeah, well, pulling a ticking
box out on an airplane

05:31.805 --> 05:34.050
Isn't necessarily
a good idea these days.

05:36.210 --> 05:39.055
Wait a minute.

05:39.090 --> 05:41.090
A plane.
The airport, rachel.

05:41.125 --> 05:43.055
Hank had to go
through security.

05:43.090 --> 05:45.655
Somewhere out there
is an x-ray of hank's bags.

05:45.690 --> 05:48.090
I'll bet you money that
t.S.A. Stores those bad boys,

05:48.125 --> 05:49.490
At least for a little while.

05:49.525 --> 05:51.295
Call your girlfriend.

05:51.330 --> 05:53.730
See if she has any pull
at homeland security.

05:53.765 --> 05:56.647
Second of all-
most importantly...

05:56.682 --> 05:59.530
You think
she's my girlfriend?

06:01.330 --> 06:02.415
Hank.

06:02.450 --> 06:04.450
We have an idea
on how to find laila.

06:04.485 --> 06:05.935
How?

06:05.970 --> 06:07.810
She's in the wind.
There's nothing to go on.

06:07.845 --> 06:09.650
The clocks-maybe
she's still following them.

06:09.685 --> 06:10.895
We should, too.

06:10.930 --> 06:12.050
We're not
giving up on this, hank.

06:12.085 --> 06:14.775
She owes all of us answers.

06:14.810 --> 06:16.570
It's pretty clear
she has no intention

06:16.605 --> 06:18.427
Of giving them to us.

06:18.462 --> 06:20.215
Where are you going?

06:20.250 --> 06:21.495
You guys keep
looking for laila,

06:21.530 --> 06:23.490
But if I'm gonna figure out
where I'm going,

06:23.525 --> 06:25.090
I need to figure out
where I started.

06:25.125 --> 06:26.787
I don't understand.

06:26.822 --> 06:28.450
I'm going home.

06:46.410 --> 06:48.295
Hank, honey.

06:48.330 --> 06:49.450
I didn't hear you come in.

06:49.485 --> 06:50.535
Where's dad?

06:50.570 --> 06:55.330
He's trying to fix that
old broken-down tractor again.

06:55.365 --> 06:56.690
We need to talk.

07:04.330 --> 07:06.815
Last couple of weeks,

07:06.850 --> 07:10.610
I've seen things-
things that don't make sense.

07:10.645 --> 07:14.010
They make me question...

07:15.850 --> 07:18.250
Whether or not
I'm part of this family.

07:19.810 --> 07:23.090
Of course you're part
of this family.

07:23.125 --> 07:24.547
Where's all this
coming from?

07:24.582 --> 07:25.935
It-it's coming from here, dad.

07:25.970 --> 07:28.850
Look, there's...
There's birthdays,

07:28.885 --> 07:29.855
Family gatherings...

07:29.890 --> 07:34.130
I mean,
every big event in my life,

07:34.165 --> 07:36.047
Except my birth.

07:36.082 --> 07:37.895
I don't understand.

07:37.930 --> 07:40.335
No first tooth,
first bath...

07:40.370 --> 07:43.890
I mean, these are the firsts
that every parent clings to-

07:43.925 --> 07:46.850
Hank, calm down.
You're scaring your mother.

07:46.885 --> 07:49.610
You're under
a lot of pressure.

07:49.645 --> 07:50.850
Everything with laila...

07:50.885 --> 07:51.935
I know.

07:51.970 --> 07:55.850
But it doesn't change
what I've seen.

07:55.885 --> 07:59.107
A nazi officer with my face,

07:59.142 --> 08:02.176
Frozen to death
in a submarine.

08:02.211 --> 08:05.175
In a clinic in paraguay,
there's...

08:05.210 --> 08:09.610
There's footage of a patient
who looks exactly like me.

08:09.645 --> 08:12.050
It doesn't make any sense.

08:13.850 --> 08:16.890
It's a simple question, dad.

08:16.925 --> 08:19.610
Am I your son?

08:25.530 --> 08:26.930
It's time.

08:28.930 --> 08:31.730
It's time we tell him
the truth.

08:43.490 --> 08:46.015
In '67, I was an army doctor

08:46.050 --> 08:49.450
Stationed at an american
military hospital in germany.

08:49.485 --> 08:51.375
I had just reported for duty,

08:51.410 --> 08:55.210
And just inside
the entrance of the hospital,

08:55.245 --> 08:57.447
There was a duffel bag,

08:57.482 --> 08:59.615
And it was... Moving.

08:59.650 --> 09:02.930
Well, I decided
to take a peek inside.

09:02.965 --> 09:05.747
And there you were...

09:05.782 --> 09:08.530
Staring up at me...

09:08.565 --> 09:10.015
Smirking.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.015
You couldn't have been more
than 2 weeks old.

09:13.050 --> 09:16.050
Your father and I couldn't have
children of our own.

09:16.085 --> 09:17.330
We'd been praying
for a miracle,

09:17.365 --> 09:19.650
And there you were.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.655
The point is,

09:21.690 --> 09:26.570
I asked you if we had family
in germany, and you lied.

09:26.605 --> 09:30.250
No, we didn't lie,
we just didn't know for sure.

09:30.285 --> 09:33.455
Hank, none of this
changes the fact

09:33.490 --> 09:36.930
That you have been
and always will be our son.

09:36.965 --> 09:39.170
That's a good story, dad.

09:39.205 --> 09:40.307
It's the truth.

09:40.342 --> 09:41.410
The whole truth?

09:41.445 --> 09:43.650
Of course.

09:54.210 --> 09:55.970
Hank, where are you going?

09:56.005 --> 09:57.695
I'm gonna try and find someone

09:57.730 --> 10:00.930
Who can give me
some real answers.

10:00.965 --> 10:02.707
Hank, come back here.

10:02.742 --> 10:04.450
Let's talk about this.

10:09.570 --> 10:13.930
He's not gonna stop
searching for answers, roland.

10:13.965 --> 10:15.970
What if he finds them?

10:17.890 --> 10:20.410
Let's pray that he doesn't.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.015
Rachel.

10:48.050 --> 10:51.770
Can you send me the address
of the nazi memorabilia guy

10:51.805 --> 10:53.887
Who gave me
this korbin sturm video?

10:53.922 --> 10:55.970
He may have
some information I need.

10:56.005 --> 10:57.215
About who?

10:57.250 --> 10:59.610
Me. I'll call you later.

10:59.645 --> 11:01.935
I got the scan!
Aw, sweet.

11:01.970 --> 11:04.810
Security scan
of your baggage from germany.

11:04.845 --> 11:06.610
The one with the clock in it.

11:06.645 --> 11:08.250
Keep me posted.

11:16.730 --> 11:18.750
Not going well?

11:18.785 --> 11:20.735
I'm not sure.

11:20.770 --> 11:22.570
This definitely doesn't
belong in the clock,

11:22.605 --> 11:24.495
So it's clearly the puzzle.

11:24.530 --> 11:26.455
What I can't figure out
is how.

11:26.490 --> 11:29.570
No hidden messages,
secret openings, nothing.

11:46.130 --> 11:47.855
It's mostly hollow inside.

11:47.890 --> 11:49.830
There's some kind
of ball in the middle.

11:49.865 --> 11:51.770
See how the density contrast
changes?

11:51.805 --> 11:52.690
You think
the puzzle's inside?

11:52.725 --> 11:56.095
Yeah, I'm already on it.

11:56.130 --> 11:58.570
Does the scan show us
anything about the clocks?

11:58.605 --> 12:01.295
You should be resting
at the hospital.

12:01.330 --> 12:05.210
The, uh, the farther away
vincent and laila get.

12:05.245 --> 12:06.575
Where's hank?

12:06.610 --> 12:08.810
He's out. Clearing his head.

12:08.845 --> 12:11.167
All right. Catch me up.

12:11.202 --> 12:13.455
What've we got here?

12:13.490 --> 12:15.650
The heat
should melt the iron.

12:20.330 --> 12:23.490
Let's just hope it doesn't
eat away whatever's inside.

12:29.250 --> 12:30.610
Oh.

12:32.130 --> 12:33.610
Oh.

12:38.890 --> 12:40.330
What is it?

12:41.770 --> 12:43.655
What are
those lines there?

12:43.690 --> 12:45.650
I don't know. It's clearly
some sort of pattern.

12:45.685 --> 12:47.410
What about that?

12:47.445 --> 12:48.330
Down there?

12:50.370 --> 12:52.255
Looks like a hole.

12:52.290 --> 12:55.090
This can't be
the entire puzzle.

12:55.125 --> 12:56.255
There's gotta be more there.

12:56.290 --> 12:58.810
There is. It's just
on the other side.

12:58.845 --> 13:01.010
The side we can't see.

13:02.370 --> 13:04.695
A crescent moon and star...

13:04.730 --> 13:08.090
An internationally recognized
symbol of the faith of islam.

13:08.125 --> 13:09.490
They're are
also symbols depicted

13:09.525 --> 13:11.447
On several muslim flags.

13:11.482 --> 13:13.186
By their position here,

13:13.221 --> 13:14.715
My guess is turkey.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.210
Turkey's a big country.

13:19.610 --> 13:22.450
I know where
the next clock is.

13:25.850 --> 13:28.690
The resemblance
is absolutely uncanny.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.295
I know.

13:30.330 --> 13:32.650
So sorry.
Where are my manners?

13:32.685 --> 13:35.295
Obatzda?

13:35.330 --> 13:36.895
No, thank you.

13:36.930 --> 13:38.335
Like I said over the phone,

13:38.370 --> 13:40.690
I was hoping you might have
some additional information

13:40.725 --> 13:42.747
About korbin sturm-

13:42.782 --> 13:44.735
His family, wife, kids?

13:44.770 --> 13:46.850
I doubt that I could
find any specifics,

13:46.885 --> 13:48.095
But we'll see.

13:48.130 --> 13:50.975
Do you know
the word "doppelganger"

13:51.010 --> 13:55.150
Is translated from the german
to be "double walker"?

13:55.185 --> 13:59.290
It's just a little bit
of trivia for you to chew on

13:59.325 --> 14:01.410
While I'm searching.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.000
Did you hear something?

16:19.035 --> 16:20.725
What?

16:20.760 --> 16:25.000
Clearly, his blood
has trespassed through history.

16:25.035 --> 16:27.880
Looking at you,
I'd say there's no question

16:27.915 --> 16:29.800
You are descended
from the commandant.

16:29.835 --> 16:32.200
The only question is, how?

16:33.800 --> 16:36.245
Aha. Here we are.

16:36.280 --> 16:39.045
It's a very impressive
bloodline,

16:39.080 --> 16:41.240
Linked directly
from the once-powerful

16:41.275 --> 16:43.045
Hohenzollern house.

16:43.080 --> 16:47.760
<i>Their motto,
"nihil sine deo" -</i>

16:47.795 --> 16:50.445
"nothing without god."

16:50.480 --> 16:52.560
Any descendents?
Any names?

16:52.595 --> 16:54.640
Mm, it's a mystery,
I'm afraid.

16:54.675 --> 16:55.600
But he had a wife?

16:55.635 --> 16:56.805
Marlena.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.800
Fled germany
just after sturm.

16:58.835 --> 17:02.285
No record of her since.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.520
Okay. Well, thank you
for your time.

17:04.555 --> 17:06.204
Surely you don't want
to leave

17:06.240 --> 17:09.160
Without touching
a little of your history.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.137
A few items of sturm I've...

17:12.172 --> 17:15.045
Had the opportunity
to obtain.

17:15.079 --> 17:19.760
Would you like
to shoot a few rounds off?

17:19.795 --> 17:21.805
I have some original bullets

17:21.839 --> 17:24.680
I keep for special occasions
such as this.

17:24.714 --> 17:27.525
No one will mind.

17:27.560 --> 17:30.320
I'll take a rain check.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.220
May I ask where
you found all these things?

17:36.255 --> 17:39.120
Mm. They turned up
six years ago in louisiana.

17:39.155 --> 17:40.897
All from the same dealer,

17:40.932 --> 17:42.640
Which is rather unusual.

17:42.675 --> 17:44.685
Dealer's name?

17:44.720 --> 17:48.520
Uh... I-I have a receipt
here somewhere.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.325
Ah, here we are.

17:53.360 --> 17:58.005
"timeless treasures."

17:58.040 --> 18:01.165
If that dealer's still
anything like I remember,

18:01.200 --> 18:05.680
You may wish you had your hands
on that luger after all.

18:05.715 --> 18:07.457
We found her!

18:07.492 --> 18:09.165
Laila? How?

18:09.200 --> 18:11.320
N.C.I.C. Shows
one of her aliases-

18:11.355 --> 18:13.337
Hannah bishop-
reserved a rental car

18:13.372 --> 18:15.285
For pickup
tomorrow in istanbul.

18:15.320 --> 18:17.520
I guess she thinks there's a clock there.
Yeah, but where?

18:17.555 --> 18:19.440
Last time I checked, that's
still a big-ass city.

18:19.475 --> 18:21.005
We gotta narrow it down.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.880
Unless somebody already
did that for us.

18:23.915 --> 18:26.720
Paige, pull up
a street map of istanbul.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.680
All those lines-it's like
the puzzle in the clock.

18:33.715 --> 18:35.520
We just have to
match the pattern

18:35.555 --> 18:37.000
To a specific intersection.

18:37.035 --> 18:39.165
But... I'm just...

18:39.200 --> 18:41.880
I'm not sure
how to do that.

18:41.915 --> 18:44.080
I think I know.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.840
It's just like doing
snap to grid

18:48.875 --> 18:51.000
On a magazine layout.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.240
"x" marks the spot.

20:20.880 --> 20:24.680
<i>♪ you've ignored
his reputation ♪</i>

20:50.460 --> 20:52.060
Where you supposed
to be, hon?

20:52.095 --> 20:53.865
I was looking for the guy,

20:53.900 --> 20:56.140
Whoever owns the junk store
across the street?

20:56.175 --> 20:57.225
That would be erik.

20:57.260 --> 20:59.220
Why am I looking
at a $5 in my hand

20:59.255 --> 21:00.505
When the bet was for $10?

21:00.540 --> 21:02.660
So either you're stupid
or you think I am.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.097
So which is it?

21:04.132 --> 21:05.465
Excuse me, erik?

21:05.500 --> 21:08.860
Can't you see
I'm in the middle of...

21:08.895 --> 21:12.220
I was hoping
you could tell me about...

21:12.255 --> 21:14.677
It's not possible.

21:14.712 --> 21:17.065
No, I'm not him.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.385
I know. I look like him.

21:19.420 --> 21:21.140
That's part of
the reason why I'm here.

21:21.175 --> 21:23.665
I want to
figure out why that is.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.620
I was hoping you could tell me
about the items that you sold

21:26.655 --> 21:28.465
That belonged
to korbin sturm.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.545
I had a right to sell them.
They were mine.

21:30.580 --> 21:32.860
How did you find them?
I mean, who gave them to you?

21:32.895 --> 21:35.980
Nobody gave them to me.
I inherited them.

21:36.015 --> 21:37.145
From who?

21:37.180 --> 21:39.980
From the man
you're the spittin' image of.

21:40.015 --> 21:41.637
From sturm.

21:41.672 --> 21:43.260
My father.

21:47.360 --> 21:50.360
I just wanna
ask you some questions.

21:50.395 --> 21:51.725
See me walkin' away?

21:51.760 --> 21:53.360
That means
I ain't keen on answerin'.

21:53.395 --> 21:54.840
Aren't you curious?

21:54.875 --> 21:55.925
About what?

21:55.960 --> 21:58.125
About why you look
like my father?

21:58.160 --> 22:00.680
It seems clear to me.
The bastard messed around.

22:00.715 --> 22:03.680
And, no, I don't do
family reunions.

22:06.840 --> 22:08.605
Hey, arron,
I can't talk right now.

22:08.640 --> 22:12.280
Yeah, I'm with a guy who says
he's korbin sturm's son.

22:12.315 --> 22:13.360
Do you know his name?

22:13.395 --> 22:15.085
Yeah. Erik haas.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.440
Wait. Why does it sound
like you're not in new york?

22:17.475 --> 22:19.637
We sort of followed laila
to istanbul.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.765
We think she's after
the next clock.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.920
Hold on. If this guy
is korbin sturm's son,

22:23.955 --> 22:25.365
Is there any way-

22:25.400 --> 22:27.900
I mean, hank,
could this guy be your dad?

22:27.935 --> 22:30.400
Either that, or he's not
who he says he is.

22:30.435 --> 22:31.600
There's only one way
to find out.

22:31.635 --> 22:33.365
Paternity test. D.N.A.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.680
Right now, he doesn't seem
very happy to see me.

22:35.715 --> 22:37.577
I don't think
I'm gonna get him

22:37.612 --> 22:39.405
To agree to give me a sample.

22:39.440 --> 22:40.920
Who said anything
about agreeing?

22:40.955 --> 22:42.517
Just go maury povich
on his ass.

22:42.552 --> 22:44.080
Steal a strand of hair
or something.

22:44.115 --> 22:46.017
Grab a hat or a hairbrush.

22:46.052 --> 22:47.846
Be careful, all of you.

22:47.881 --> 22:49.640
We will. We promise.

22:59.280 --> 23:01.320
Mr. Haas?

23:02.960 --> 23:06.400
Mr. Haas?

23:07.680 --> 23:10.000
Mr. Haas?

23:12.920 --> 23:16.480
I'm not leaving
until I get my answers.

23:17.840 --> 23:21.160
We can talk, or you can
drag my ass outta here.

23:21.195 --> 23:23.200
It's your choice.

23:27.960 --> 23:29.125
Your mother...

23:29.160 --> 23:34.560
Three months pregnant
when he abandoned us.

23:34.595 --> 23:36.937
You're talking about
marlena sturm?

23:36.972 --> 23:39.280
I can tell
I'm gonna need more beer

23:39.315 --> 23:40.885
To continue
this conversation.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.640
I have some in the front.
Do not make yourself at home.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.885
<i>Why did god
make me this way?</i>

24:03.920 --> 24:06.640
God didn't make you
this way. Your parents did.

24:06.675 --> 24:08.017
Why didn't they want me?

24:08.052 --> 24:09.360
Why did they leave me here?

24:09.395 --> 24:11.405
Vincent...

24:11.440 --> 24:14.280
You must accept
your circumstances.

24:14.315 --> 24:17.120
This is where you are,
who you are.

24:28.480 --> 24:31.805
I did what she asked.

24:31.840 --> 24:33.360
I looked
into hank galliston.

24:33.395 --> 24:35.285
Tell her...

24:35.320 --> 24:38.560
I found
nothing of importance.

24:44.040 --> 24:50.400
I'm curious-how did you
get into this business?

24:50.435 --> 24:53.920
Your parents...
Where are they?

24:57.760 --> 24:59.520
So you don't like
to speak?

25:08.840 --> 25:10.560
Did she do this to you?

25:15.560 --> 25:17.720
Do you want to see
what they did to me?

25:32.560 --> 25:35.520
We must be willing
to go further than them

25:35.555 --> 25:38.480
To do what they're too scared
or weak to do.

25:38.515 --> 25:42.297
Cross that line,
and they will yield.

25:42.332 --> 25:46.080
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

25:46.115 --> 25:48.405
Good.

25:48.440 --> 25:52.360
There is something
I need you to do for me.

26:08.640 --> 26:11.165
It was different back then.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.245
A man could
call himself a treasure hunter,

26:13.280 --> 26:17.040
People begged for stories,
stories about us old-timers.

26:17.075 --> 26:19.320
What kind of treasures
were you looking for?

26:19.355 --> 26:21.417
Depended on
what needed finding.

26:21.452 --> 26:23.686
That's the thing
about treasures-

26:23.721 --> 26:25.885
Wasn't always
about a pot of gold.

26:25.920 --> 26:29.280
Nah, real treasure-
that's about someone

26:29.315 --> 26:31.205
Wanting something bad enough,

26:31.240 --> 26:34.560
They'll do or pay
just about anything to get it.

26:56.640 --> 26:58.405
Your father
didn't abandon you.

26:58.440 --> 27:00.960
You have this idea
of who korbin sturm was,

27:00.995 --> 27:02.485
But you're wrong.

27:02.520 --> 27:04.445
He didn't leave
for another woman.

27:04.480 --> 27:08.040
He left because he thought
the world was in danger.

27:08.075 --> 27:10.685
He sacrificed himself
for a higher calling.

27:10.720 --> 27:15.360
What higher calling could there
possibly be than family?

27:15.395 --> 27:17.920
How do you just leave
without saying a word,

27:17.955 --> 27:21.280
Without explaining why?

27:22.400 --> 27:25.205
I don't know why.

27:25.240 --> 27:28.320
But I do know that people
aren't always what they seem.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.645
<i>They have secrets.</i>

27:31.680 --> 27:34.240
Maybe he thought by leaving,
he was protecting you.

27:34.275 --> 27:35.645
He didn't protect us.

27:35.680 --> 27:38.080
After he left, the nazis
came after my mother.

27:38.115 --> 27:39.965
The only safe place
she could find

27:40.000 --> 27:42.760
Was with a family friend
halfway around the world-

27:42.795 --> 27:44.320
Istanbul.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.920
<i>That's where I was born,
in a dump of a house.</i>

28:06.720 --> 28:08.645
<i>But the friend
who took us in-</i>

28:08.680 --> 28:11.965
<i>He was good to us.
Kind of a holy guy, you know?</i>

28:12.000 --> 28:16.120
But he died kind of sudden,
in some kind of accident.

28:16.155 --> 28:19.357
And my mom,
after she passed-

28:19.392 --> 28:22.525
I got the house
in istanbul.

28:22.560 --> 28:25.120
I always thought that house
was a piece of crap.

28:25.155 --> 28:28.417
But you know what?
I was wrong.

28:28.452 --> 28:31.645
That house
was where it all began,

28:31.680 --> 28:36.000
Where I learned
about finding... Treasures.

28:36.035 --> 28:38.080
The clock's gone.

28:40.440 --> 28:44.085
Someone must have
gotten here first.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.200
It doesn't look like anyone's
lived here in a while.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.685
Hello, laila.

29:22.720 --> 29:26.880
Or is it anna
or hannah or sarah?

29:26.915 --> 29:28.480
It's been hard keeping up.

29:29.920 --> 29:31.360
Laila, no!

29:55.670 --> 29:59.630
I wondered why you didn't
want me to see your face.

29:59.665 --> 30:03.430
I thought perhaps
you were misshapen...

30:03.465 --> 30:04.915
A burn victim.

30:04.950 --> 30:07.350
You're to go through the boy.

30:07.385 --> 30:09.267
You took his tongue.

30:09.302 --> 30:11.126
What foul sort of woman

30:11.161 --> 30:12.950
Does that to a child?

30:16.190 --> 30:17.950
What do you want,
mr. Vincent?

30:17.985 --> 30:20.350
Answers.

30:21.950 --> 30:26.030
The cross of christ-
is that where it all leads?

30:26.065 --> 30:28.350
Why would a couple
of old timbers

30:28.385 --> 30:30.590
Be worth all that pain?

30:32.470 --> 30:34.430
Because I believe.

30:35.950 --> 30:38.110
And I do not.

30:39.430 --> 30:41.235
Why would you...

30:41.270 --> 30:44.235
With your... History?

30:44.270 --> 30:48.190
You think we don't know
about those horrible, milky eyes

30:48.225 --> 30:51.355
You keep hidden
from the rest of the world?

30:51.390 --> 30:56.110
Those are the real answers
you're interested in,

30:56.145 --> 30:57.755
Mr. Vincent.

30:57.790 --> 31:02.270
You wanna know about the kid
who grew up in the orphanage,

31:02.305 --> 31:05.190
The one who spent his entire
life without parents,

31:05.225 --> 31:08.990
Wondering where he came from,
who made him,

31:09.025 --> 31:12.790
Who knows
only one language-

31:12.825 --> 31:14.395
Violence-

31:14.430 --> 31:17.590
Because he can't exist
with the rest of humanity.

31:17.625 --> 31:20.790
Yes, I know
everything about him...

31:20.825 --> 31:24.875
Every single thing
there is.

31:24.910 --> 31:27.430
I want you to tell me
everything you know,

31:27.465 --> 31:28.470
Or I break your neck.

31:28.505 --> 31:30.715
Oh.

31:30.750 --> 31:33.275
Oh, vincent.

31:33.310 --> 31:37.790
You can't kill the only one
who has the answers.

31:37.825 --> 31:39.870
Nor can you torture me.

31:39.905 --> 31:41.315
I'm a believer.

31:41.350 --> 31:44.550
I'll die before I break.

31:48.150 --> 31:51.755
I will tell you...

31:51.790 --> 31:55.355
Your whole sordid secret.

31:55.390 --> 31:59.750
You just have to
find the cross.

31:59.785 --> 32:01.875
You do that for me,

32:01.910 --> 32:06.510
And it'll be
a time of revelation.

32:10.990 --> 32:13.955
Trust me.

32:13.990 --> 32:15.835
No more secrets.

32:15.870 --> 32:18.830
No more puzzles,
no more riddles.

32:18.865 --> 32:21.790
Let's start
with russiyana flight 71.

32:21.825 --> 32:22.875
You purchased a ticket,

32:22.910 --> 32:24.790
But you didn't board
the flight. Why?

32:24.825 --> 32:26.670
I got a call from a friend
who needed me.

32:26.705 --> 32:27.995
So I got off-
you're lying!

32:28.030 --> 32:30.410
You knew that flight
was gonna explode.

32:30.445 --> 32:33.077
You knew those people
were gonna die,

32:33.112 --> 32:35.710
All 217 of them,
including my husband.

32:35.745 --> 32:38.155
What do you know, laila?

32:38.190 --> 32:41.315
What do you know
about that flight?

32:41.350 --> 32:45.150
Some questions
are better left unanswered,

32:45.185 --> 32:46.835
For everyone's sake.

32:46.870 --> 32:50.350
I know what
you're here to find, hank.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.830
You think I'm your father,

32:52.865 --> 32:53.755
But I'm not.

32:53.790 --> 32:55.170
How can you be so sure?

32:55.205 --> 32:56.515
Because when I was young,

32:56.550 --> 32:59.915
I had
an unfortunate accident.

32:59.950 --> 33:03.550
Let's just say
it's medically impossible.

33:05.790 --> 33:08.750
Whoever lived here
was one of these new apostles.

33:08.785 --> 33:10.115
Right?
Holiest of holies?

33:10.150 --> 33:13.390
Well, the last guy who owned
this place wasn't so holy.

33:13.425 --> 33:15.315
He was kind of the opposite.

33:15.350 --> 33:18.010
12 outstanding warrants,
3 of them violent.

33:18.045 --> 33:20.670
The name erik haas
mean anything to you?

33:20.705 --> 33:22.075
Oh, no.

33:22.110 --> 33:24.430
Hank's in trouble.

33:24.465 --> 33:25.515
How?

33:25.550 --> 33:26.470
The guy he's with
is bad news.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.995
Okay, call the bureau.

33:28.030 --> 33:29.350
Tell them to set up a team.

33:29.385 --> 33:31.327
I'll try calling hank.

33:31.362 --> 33:33.270
Don't think about moving.

33:37.550 --> 33:39.950
Excuse me.
I have to take this.

33:43.590 --> 33:45.390
Can you hear me?

33:45.425 --> 33:47.155
Hank, you're with...

33:47.190 --> 33:48.890
Dangerous. You need to...

33:48.925 --> 33:50.555
What? I-I can't hear you.

33:50.590 --> 33:52.510
The clocks...
Did you say "clocks"?

33:52.545 --> 33:53.915
Did you find laila?

33:53.950 --> 33:55.870
I think you've been
just a little

33:55.905 --> 33:57.887
Disingenuous with me, hank.

33:57.922 --> 33:59.835
- he's dangerous.
- Get out...

33:59.870 --> 34:02.510
You didn't come here
hunting for a father.

34:02.545 --> 34:04.830
You came here
hunting for a clock.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.699
I have no qualms
about shooting a man.

34:14.735 --> 34:15.905
I've done it before.

34:15.940 --> 34:17.745
Whatever you think
you've heard...

34:17.780 --> 34:20.820
I heard you loud and clear.
The clock's my birthright,

34:20.855 --> 34:23.179
And no bastard son
of my father

34:23.215 --> 34:24.917
Is gonna take that from me.

34:24.952 --> 34:26.585
You came here for a payday,

34:26.620 --> 34:30.380
Spinnin' stories about
what a noble man my father was,

34:30.415 --> 34:32.264
When I know it's all
a bunch of bull.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.900
Whatever you think you know
about that clock, you're wrong.

34:34.935 --> 34:36.377
It'll get you killed.

34:36.411 --> 34:37.784
You know what I think?

34:37.820 --> 34:41.540
I think you're trying
to put the fear of god in me,

34:41.574 --> 34:43.264
Make me give it up.

34:43.300 --> 34:47.500
Is that what you're trying
to do, galliston?

34:47.534 --> 34:49.025
Get up. We're leaving.

34:49.060 --> 34:52.219
What do you care,
after what you've done to him?

34:53.340 --> 34:54.820
Whoa.

34:57.300 --> 34:58.745
Help me, please!

34:58.780 --> 35:00.780
I'm a United States
federal agent.

35:00.815 --> 35:01.940
These people kidnapped me!

35:06.340 --> 35:08.940
Check my pockets. My fbi
credentials are right inside.

35:08.975 --> 35:10.225
She's lying!

35:10.260 --> 35:13.105
Go ahead and check. Go ahead.

35:13.140 --> 35:16.945
Time for you to leave
before you can't.

35:16.980 --> 35:19.540
Everything I'm telling you
is the truth, okay?

35:19.575 --> 35:21.105
I can prove it.

35:21.140 --> 35:22.905
If you reach into my pocket,

35:22.940 --> 35:25.100
There's a letter
from your father.

35:25.135 --> 35:26.145
Bull crap.

35:26.180 --> 35:29.140
It's in
his own handwriting,

35:29.175 --> 35:30.985
In his own words.

35:31.020 --> 35:33.185
Don't believe
a word she's saying.

35:33.220 --> 35:35.660
On behalf of
the United States of america.

35:35.695 --> 35:37.597
She grabbed me off
the street against my will!

35:37.632 --> 35:39.465
- it's not true.
- She's wanted for questioning

35:39.500 --> 35:43.540
We believe that she is aiding
and abetting a known terrorist.

35:56.300 --> 35:57.385
Where's laila?

35:57.420 --> 35:58.865
One of his men had her.

35:58.900 --> 36:01.540
That's impossible.
All my men are here.

36:11.740 --> 36:14.540
"I chose the world over you...

36:14.575 --> 36:17.025
"my love...

36:17.060 --> 36:18.545
"but if I had to do it again,

36:18.580 --> 36:22.780
I would choose you
over the world."

36:25.380 --> 36:27.665
"to my unborn child,

36:27.700 --> 36:32.420
"words cannot express
the conflicted feelings

36:32.455 --> 36:38.220
"of pain, loss, and love
I have,

36:38.255 --> 36:41.297
Knowing that I"...

36:41.332 --> 36:44.305
"will never hold you

36:44.340 --> 36:46.860
"or be able to tell you that

36:46.895 --> 36:50.540
I will protect you"...

36:52.660 --> 36:54.580
"forever."

37:10.620 --> 37:12.305
If what you say is true,

37:12.340 --> 37:15.020
Then my father was not
the son of a bitch

37:15.055 --> 37:17.777
I thought he was.

37:17.812 --> 37:20.500
Help me here.

37:21.860 --> 37:23.620
Yeah?

37:29.100 --> 37:30.940
And I guess
these aren't as valuable

37:30.975 --> 37:32.420
As I thought they were.

37:32.455 --> 37:33.585
Oh, my god.

37:33.620 --> 37:35.825
How did you find-

37:35.860 --> 37:37.660
I told you,
I'm a treasure hunter.

37:37.695 --> 37:39.385
I'm good at what I do.

37:39.420 --> 37:41.025
I tried
getting the eighth.

37:41.060 --> 37:44.300
I tracked it all the way
to a flea market in brooklyn.

37:46.420 --> 37:48.300
<i>Someone swiped it out
from under me</i>

37:48.335 --> 37:49.820
Before I got there.

37:51.220 --> 37:54.020
If I can find you,
they will, too.

37:55.420 --> 37:57.420
We need to move these.

38:40.700 --> 38:42.240
You didn't need
to send in the cavalry.

38:42.275 --> 38:43.947
I would've figured out
another way.

38:43.982 --> 38:45.585
And risk everything
we've worked for?

38:45.620 --> 38:48.380
I told you your husband
would not stop seeking answers.

38:48.415 --> 38:49.545
It wasn't him.

38:49.580 --> 38:52.420
It was the kids and her.

38:52.455 --> 38:55.225
She knows about flight 71.

38:55.260 --> 38:57.300
Then you know
what you must do.

39:03.100 --> 39:04.665
Unbelievable.

39:04.700 --> 39:06.865
How did he get all seven?

39:06.900 --> 39:11.580
He got the first one
from the apostle in istanbul,

39:11.615 --> 39:13.177
And that one led
to the next,

39:13.212 --> 39:14.705
And to the next,
like us,

39:14.740 --> 39:18.100
Until he got to the one
that laila found

39:18.135 --> 39:19.780
At the flea market.

39:19.815 --> 39:20.865
Huh.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.300
He thought they'd
make him rich.

39:23.335 --> 39:25.665
And he just
gave them to you?

39:25.700 --> 39:27.985
He said he didn't
need 'em anymore.

39:28.020 --> 39:31.700
He thought that ours
was a more noble quest.

39:34.420 --> 39:36.340
How was laila?

39:36.375 --> 39:39.380
Cold.

39:41.980 --> 39:45.305
Paige just sent
the d.N.A. Results.

39:45.340 --> 39:47.260
Looks like the hair
you took from his hat

39:47.295 --> 39:48.265
Had a viable sample.

39:48.300 --> 39:50.740
If erik haas is your father,

39:50.775 --> 39:53.380
This is gonna tell us.

39:53.415 --> 39:54.465
What?

39:54.500 --> 39:56.820
It's impossible.

39:58.740 --> 40:01.060
What's it say?

40:01.095 --> 40:03.977
According to this,

40:04.012 --> 40:06.860
Hank isn't erik's son.

40:06.900 --> 40:09.120
Hank is erik's father.

40:09.155 --> 40:11.305
Doesn't make any sense.

40:11.340 --> 40:13.180
Maybe there's some kind
of mistake.

40:17.860 --> 40:18.945
Hello?

40:18.980 --> 40:20.900
Hello, hank.

40:22.220 --> 40:25.025
We need to meet.

40:25.060 --> 40:26.580
It's time to end this.
