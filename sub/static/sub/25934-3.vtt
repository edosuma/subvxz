00:06.140 --> 00:09.320
Cal, as you can see,
it's chaos here.

WOMAN: It's gonna be
a little squeezy in here.

This place hasn't functioned

MR JAKOB: I've been doing
this job a long time.

00:16.860 --> 00:20.160
Would you like a little drink,
perhaps, to calm the nerves?

00:20.220 --> 00:22.600
Maybe a little settler.

00:22.660 --> 00:24.720
Is it true you were going
to call your party

00:24.780 --> 00:26.720
the Penny Evans Experience

00:26.780 --> 00:29.920
and then somebody pointed out,
that'd make you the PEE party.

00:29.980 --> 00:31.280
I've been telling you
for over a year now

00:31.340 --> 00:32.680
that you need to get
a media manager.

00:32.740 --> 00:33.680
Exactly. Yes. Yes, yes.

00:33.740 --> 00:34.960
But you didn't want to
spend the money!

00:35.020 --> 00:36.600
And now we have one,
because I've had a brainwave.

00:36.660 --> 00:37.600
Who?
Frank.

00:37.660 --> 00:39.080
A footy columnist, no doubt.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.160
The hardest, the toughest school
there is, and you would know.

00:41.220 --> 00:42.640
When was the last time
he worked, Cleaver?

00:42.700 --> 00:46.000
You stole the US Defence
Secretary's phone,

00:46.060 --> 00:48.320
you took a snap of your penis,

00:48.380 --> 00:51.120
and you sexted it to the
Italian Ambassador and others.

00:51.180 --> 00:53.840
I used to think that
there was a rock bottom,

00:53.900 --> 00:56.080
and then I realised
there is no rock bottom.

00:57.460 --> 01:01.840
It's just one giant abyss
that keeps going down and down.

01:01.900 --> 01:04.160
Not a terrorist attack, you say?

01:04.220 --> 01:07.760
Turds and cleaning fluids
in a lethal combination.

01:07.820 --> 01:09.320
So this was just an accident.

01:09.380 --> 01:11.400
Fuck!

Oh. It's quarter to five.

02:21.820 --> 02:24.840
OK. OK. You go, girl.

02:27.540 --> 02:31.000
(SIGHS) I told the people of
Australia it was a terrorist attack.

02:31.060 --> 02:32.880
Oh, that's the right note.

02:32.940 --> 02:36.440
(SIGHS) I told them terrorists
killed Brian Oatley

02:36.500 --> 02:39.360
when really he just had a coronary
while he was rooting Astrid.

02:39.420 --> 02:40.560
Yeah.

02:40.620 --> 02:43.920
It wasn't a terrorist attack, Gar,
it was shitty plumbing.

02:43.980 --> 02:45.320
I could go to jail!

02:45.380 --> 02:47.680
Oh, stop, stop.
No-one's going to go to jail.

02:47.740 --> 02:50.000
Shitty plumbing's
not a criminal offence.

02:50.060 --> 02:51.480
Anyway it was under Labour's watch.

02:51.540 --> 02:53.480
That's not the point,
and you know it.

So is deep-fried duck tongue
and fermented tofu.

03:57.420 --> 03:59.080
I'm not smearing that on my fangs.

03:59.140 --> 04:00.520
It fights bacteria.

Well, they all fight bacteria,
don't they?

04:02.500 --> 04:05.160
I mean, that's the name of the game,
isn't it? Oh, Jesus Christ.

04:05.220 --> 04:07.600

some proper toothpaste.

I really do like you,

I'm afraid.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.080

Hmm.

Today? What now?

05:23.220 --> 05:24.160
Yep.

05:27.940 --> 05:29.360
Is this about her?

05:29.420 --> 05:31.000
It's about her, isn't it?

It's nowhere.

You did pick it up from
the concierge at Da Vinci's?

05:40.660 --> 05:42.720
Of course I picked it up
from the concierge.

05:42.780 --> 05:45.040
You...you needed to go to the loo.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.120
Ah, we agreed to meet outside.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.640
I went back in to get my pack.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.720
I bumped into Greg Peters,
I got distracted.

05:50.780 --> 05:52.280
I don't have my fucking suit pack.

05:52.340 --> 05:55.400
Oh, my God!
It's got my phone, my wallet.

this morning.

by a studio car.

without the gossip.

OK, well, could you please
spot me some cash, then. Please.

06:08.100 --> 06:11.120
Well, I've only got a couple of
bucks. I just do cards these days.

06:11.180 --> 06:13.840

What about coins on the floor?

06:13.900 --> 06:15.480
Coins on the f... Come on!

06:15.540 --> 06:19.480
I mean, Jesus Christ, what if you
need an emergency game of pool

or a packet of Tic Tacs or something?

a 15-minute walk from here.

06:23.380 --> 06:26.080

there - everybody does.

06:26.140 --> 06:30.240
OK, so a 15-minute walk, dressed as
a zebra in the nation's capital.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.680
Oh, where's my head, by the way?

06:32.740 --> 06:36.200
Your what? Your head?
My head, my head. My zebra head.

06:36.260 --> 06:38.120
I haven't seen it.
I have no idea!

06:38.180 --> 06:41.640
This is...this is why
I hate fancy dress.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.600
Alright? Aside from the fact

06:44.660 --> 06:47.600
that I'm always last person
in the hire shop

06:47.660 --> 06:49.360
and all the good cossies have gone.

dressed as fucking Cary Grant,

06:52.940 --> 06:54.840

07:57.820 --> 08:01.640
Hey.
Hello, poppet. How are you?

08:02.820 --> 08:06.240
Wends, I think I might have mentioned
it before, but her name is Winsome.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.600
Oh.
Or in lighter moments, Winnie.

08:08.660 --> 08:10.760
Yeah, no, you have...you have
mentioned that, Missy.

08:10.820 --> 08:13.720
Do you mind if we just turn the
music off so I can listen to Fran?

08:13.780 --> 08:15.200
Oh, this is her favourite song!

08:15.260 --> 08:17.400
She's been in a bit of a mood
this morning, so...

08:17.460 --> 08:19.360
Well, can you put those buds
in her ears, or something?

08:19.420 --> 08:21.200
Oh, gosh, no. She's way too little
for buds.

08:21.260 --> 08:23.400
This is a key stage in the
development of her auditory...

08:23.460 --> 08:24.640
OK, I don't know if you've noticed

08:24.700 --> 08:26.120
in the year you've been living here,
Missy,

08:26.180 --> 08:28.360
but there are actually just a couple
of rituals that I really enjoy,

08:28.420 --> 08:29.360
and listening to Fran

08:29.420 --> 08:31.000
and having a cup of tea
in my kitchen is one of them.

08:31.060 --> 08:33.080
Wends, please don't adopt that
aggressive tone in front of...

08:33.140 --> 08:35.240
OK, I wasn't intending
to be aggressive.

08:35.300 --> 08:38.080
She can also detect insincerity.

08:38.140 --> 08:41.880
Look, why don't we,
um, make up a roster?

08:41.940 --> 08:44.240
No, why don't we NOT make a roster?

08:44.300 --> 08:46.480
Why don't I have a cup of tea
in my kitchen?

08:46.540 --> 08:48.880
You've got the run of
the rest of the house.

08:48.940 --> 08:50.800
We're talking about the welfare
of your granddaughter.

08:50.860 --> 08:53.120
We're not talking about
anyone's welfare, Missy.

08:53.180 --> 08:56.320
We're talking about a political chat
show and a cup of tea in my kitchen.

08:56.380 --> 08:58.720
We are talking about
me having some space

08:58.780 --> 09:00.200
in my own fucking house.

09:00.260 --> 09:02.120
Wendy,
I'm hearing a lot of 'me' here.

09:02.180 --> 09:03.800
Are you putting your own needs
ahead of...?

09:03.860 --> 09:05.680
Yes! I am putting my own needs
ahead of Winnie.

09:05.740 --> 09:07.000
Fucking hell! "Winnie!"

09:07.060 --> 09:09.200
I mean, Missy, really,
that is just cruel.

09:09.260 --> 09:11.280
I beg your pardon?
Winnie! It's not a name!

09:11.340 --> 09:12.960
It's a sound
a fucking horse makes!

09:13.020 --> 09:14.440

09:14.500 --> 09:16.480
Churchill or the bear
or Winnie Mandela?

09:16.540 --> 09:19.560
Wendy, may I suggest you take
your tea and your negative energy

09:19.620 --> 09:20.840
and you return to your room,

09:20.900 --> 09:22.360
which I believe
has a functioning radio.

09:22.420 --> 09:24.480
No. Melissa, this is my house,
alright?

09:25.820 --> 09:27.600
What are you doing? Wends?

09:27.660 --> 09:29.360
Bloody batteries!
What are you doing?

09:29.420 --> 09:31.520
I'm trying to turn
this wretched thing off!

09:45.860 --> 09:47.960
That's my head. That's my head!

09:48.020 --> 09:49.920
Give me back...
Where'd you get my head?

09:49.980 --> 09:52.800
If I don't get my head back,
I don't get my deposit back.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.040
Come back here, you...you prick!

09:55.100 --> 09:56.800
Give me... Oh, fuck you.

Oh...

10:06.500 --> 10:09.680

quite how else to put this.

10:09.740 --> 10:11.760
What are you wearing
and why are you wearing it?

10:11.820 --> 10:15.120
I'd appreciate some privacy
at this difficult time.

10:15.180 --> 10:17.280
What difficult time? You're wearing
a headless zebra costume.

10:17.340 --> 10:18.720
Where's the head?

10:18.780 --> 10:21.160
Uh, well, that's, uh, a question

10:21.220 --> 10:24.200
that all of Australia
should be asking itself right now,

10:24.260 --> 10:25.680
wouldn't you say?

10:25.740 --> 10:27.120
Senator? Senator?

I really have no idea.

11:09.180 --> 11:10.800
Yeah? No idea. That's good.

11:10.860 --> 11:14.480
Good? Hearts are breaking out there,
Wendy, and it's my fault.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.920
No, Amy, it's...it's, you know,

11:16.980 --> 11:19.200
you are being honest with yourself
and that's...

11:19.260 --> 11:21.480
You remember, it's all there.
It's in my book, in Chapter 12.

11:22.820 --> 11:24.720
You're talking numbers to me, Wendy.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.880
I'll give you numbers.

11:28.940 --> 11:32.280
Two marriages, seven kids,
one big business.

11:32.340 --> 11:34.160
There's a lot at stake here.

11:34.220 --> 11:36.440
I mean, I know what
the right thing to do is

11:36.500 --> 11:39.320
but I'm just not sure
it's what I want.

11:39.380 --> 11:41.640
Toby is such a sweetheart.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.120
And Kit's...

11:44.820 --> 11:47.400
Wendy, I'm in the middle
of a crisis here.

11:47.460 --> 11:49.120
Are you paying me
any attention at all?

11:49.180 --> 11:51.120
I'm sorry.
It's a really strange day.

11:51.180 --> 11:53.760
Well, I am paying you
above the odds, Wendy.

11:53.820 --> 11:56.160
We all have our strange days.

11:56.220 --> 11:58.200
I'm not convinced that
you do have strange days.

11:58.260 --> 11:59.320
You know?

11:59.380 --> 12:01.400
You've been coming to me
for three years,

12:01.460 --> 12:04.320
and it's always the exact same story,
you know?

12:04.380 --> 12:07.600
Toby's a sweetheart,
Kit's an animal. It never changes.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.120
Your days are all screwed up.

12:09.180 --> 12:12.080
So that means, by definition,
that they're not actually strange.

12:12.140 --> 12:13.560
Do you understand me?

12:13.620 --> 12:16.200
You know, if you fuck a gorilla once,
then that is strange and it's sad.

12:16.260 --> 12:18.400
But if you fuck a gorilla
every single day,

12:18.460 --> 12:19.960
then you're just into
fucking gorillas.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.080
Fucking gorillas?
Mm.

12:24.220 --> 12:25.800
That's your professional opinion,
is it?

12:25.860 --> 12:27.400
That is my professional opinion.

12:28.420 --> 12:31.640
Well, I shan't be darkening
your doorstep again.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.120
Well, I don't blame you.

12:33.180 --> 12:36.200
You know, in three years we have
achieved absolutely bugger all!

12:40.500 --> 12:43.040
(LAUGHS)
Yes. Yes, yes.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.280
I'm sure it's all over the net
by now, isn't it?

12:45.340 --> 12:46.720
Yes. (LAUGHS)
Yes, yes.

12:46.780 --> 12:49.000
Well, after you've
had your little chuckle,

12:49.060 --> 12:51.280
can you just find me
my spare suit and shit?

12:51.340 --> 12:52.280
Alright.

12:52.340 --> 12:54.040
And we can crack on because
I've got a speech to make.

12:54.100 --> 12:57.040
OK, this, uh, spare suit and shit
would be...?

12:57.100 --> 12:59.560
Well, here, in the closet.
Right.

12:59.620 --> 13:02.320
Oh, OK. Well, you show me
where the magical closet is.

13:02.380 --> 13:04.400
Are you telling me
I don't have a spare suit?

13:04.460 --> 13:06.880
Yes, that's exactly
what I'm telling you, Cleaver.

13:06.940 --> 13:08.440
Everybody has a spare suit.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.560
Nicole, I'm really starting to doubt
your level of compet...

13:10.620 --> 13:12.520
Well, you had four spare suits
before the Andy Chow passed.

13:12.580 --> 13:14.000
OK, call up Da Vinci's, please,

13:14.060 --> 13:15.880
and tell them that
I left my suit pack there.

13:15.940 --> 13:18.360
And it's a national emergency.
And, yes, it's a national emergency.

13:18.420 --> 13:20.680
OK, well, they're not open, Cleaver,
and you're on in 15 minutes.

13:20.740 --> 13:24.840
Why did you put me down to talk
about banking in the first place?

13:24.900 --> 13:26.600
I mean, I don't know anything
about... What do I know?

13:26.660 --> 13:28.640
You said you wanted
to raise your profile!

13:28.700 --> 13:30.200
And banking is a very big issue.

13:30.260 --> 13:32.520
I thought it would be great for you.
Reschedule it.

13:32.580 --> 13:34.480
I can't. It's the Senate,
it's not a dental appointment.

13:34.540 --> 13:35.480
Well, what are we...?

13:35.540 --> 13:37.960
I mean, they're not going to let me
in there like this, are they?

13:38.020 --> 13:41.680
Don't be like that. I think that you
look really lovely as a zebra.

13:41.740 --> 13:45.160
Come on, I've seen you
spin weirder shit in court.

13:46.820 --> 13:48.640
OK.

13:48.700 --> 13:51.400
I'm...I'm going to take this
as a challenge.

13:51.460 --> 13:52.640
Mm-hm.
Alright?

13:52.700 --> 13:54.000
Mm-hm.
OK.

13:54.060 --> 13:56.840
Can you find out everything there
is to know

13:56.900 --> 13:58.960
about where zebras come from?

13:59.020 --> 14:00.600
Okey-dokey.

14:00.660 --> 14:02.080
Zebras.

14:05.260 --> 14:07.240
Mr President,

14:07.300 --> 14:10.840
I have recently discovered,
to my great shock,

14:10.900 --> 14:13.600
that instead of being born
in Deniliquin, New South Wales,

14:13.660 --> 14:17.440
and christened Fiona Eileen Boyd,
as I truly believed,

14:17.500 --> 14:21.360
it transpires that I was born
in Gdansk, Poland,

14:21.420 --> 14:24.360
and christened
Fjonana Anastazja Laszlo.

14:24.420 --> 14:26.800
It was therefore utterly bewildering

14:26.860 --> 14:29.280
to discover
that I had Polish citizenship

14:29.340 --> 14:30.840
at the time of the election.

14:30.900 --> 14:34.320
And so I shall be resigning
from the Senate forthwith.

14:34.380 --> 14:36.320
MAN: Shame!
About time.

14:37.260 --> 14:39.440
My parents, Lech and Henrika,

14:39.500 --> 14:41.760
who are currently visiting relatives
in Gdansk,

14:41.820 --> 14:45.280
are mortified that they
forgot to tell me this detail.

14:46.420 --> 14:48.560
But in fairness to them,
they do have limited English.

14:48.620 --> 14:51.400
Oh, for fuck's sake, I thought
we cleaned all this shit up.

14:51.460 --> 14:52.960
Who's next on our ticket?

14:53.020 --> 14:55.200
Lu Yuen.
And he's Australian?

14:55.260 --> 14:56.200
She!

14:56.260 --> 14:59.720
She is a naturalised Australian who
renounced her Chinese citizenship.

14:59.780 --> 15:01.320
OK, that's not my point, Gar.

15:01.380 --> 15:04.040
It's not the gender I'm concerned
about. It is the Australian-ness.

15:04.100 --> 15:05.640
We need to look dinkum again.

15:05.700 --> 15:07.360
We can appoint anyone we want, right?

15:07.420 --> 15:09.960
Well, as a place filler
till the next election, yeah.

15:10.020 --> 15:12.280
Alright. We need to get
someone old-school.

15:12.340 --> 15:14.040
Someone who can scare the shit
out of them.

15:14.100 --> 15:16.200
We need the limelight back on us.

15:17.380 --> 15:18.520
OK, good.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.480
(COMPUTER BEEPS)
Fuck, fuck.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.640
(COMPUTER BEEPS)
Fuck you!

15:24.940 --> 15:26.680
Go.

15:26.740 --> 15:29.080
Oh, you bloody piece of shit.

15:32.660 --> 15:34.120
(COMPUTER BEEPS)
OK.

15:34.180 --> 15:37.400
The Senate is debating
the proposed amendments

15:37.460 --> 15:41.240
to the Banking And Financial
Regulations Act, 2015.

15:42.140 --> 15:44.800
Senator Greene.
Oh, yes, Mr President.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.880
You must be aware that your costume,
or whatever it may be described as,

15:47.940 --> 15:50.040
is beyond inappropriate.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.720
How is that, Mr President?
Senator Greene, don't toy with me.

15:52.780 --> 15:55.280
There are standing orders
which you are aware of.

15:55.340 --> 15:56.600
Yes, Mr President.

15:56.660 --> 15:58.440
I would respectfully refer you to

15:58.500 --> 16:01.400
one of the great former speakers
of the other place,

16:01.460 --> 16:05.520
the luminous Sir Billy Snedden,
who in 1977,

16:05.580 --> 16:09.760
issued a ruling allowing the wearing
of safari suits in the Lower House.

16:09.820 --> 16:13.680
And I would respectfully submit,
Mr President,

16:13.740 --> 16:18.040
that my current attire is nothing
if not a safari suit.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.960
Alright, go. Print.

16:22.380 --> 16:24.080
Well, you were printing before.

16:25.060 --> 16:26.880
I don't need a cable!
It doesn't need a cable!

16:26.940 --> 16:29.880
Well, because
I've used all the paper!

16:29.940 --> 16:32.960
This is like the
Year 9 library printer!

16:33.020 --> 16:35.680
Very well, Mr Greene.
May as well kick things off.

16:35.740 --> 16:38.120
Mr President, I really must object.

16:38.180 --> 16:40.840
Sit down, Senator Potter.
Proceed, Senator Greene.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.880
Thank you, Mr President.

16:46.420 --> 16:47.800
I shall proceed.

16:47.860 --> 16:52.600
Are you seriously
going to let him speak, you moron?

16:52.660 --> 16:54.120
For Christ's sake!

16:54.180 --> 16:57.160
The man is wearing a zebra suit.

16:57.220 --> 16:58.680
Kick him out!

16:58.740 --> 17:00.440
Don't let him talk.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.960
Fuck!

17:10.340 --> 17:13.360
(SIGHS) Shit!

17:13.420 --> 17:15.880
That, that.

17:18.540 --> 17:23.520
Mr President, I don't know
if this chamber is aware

17:23.580 --> 17:28.920
that today is
Botswanan Independence Day.

17:28.980 --> 17:33.080
And that the national symbol
of Botswana is the zebra,

17:33.140 --> 17:36.120
surely one of the most,
if not THE most,

17:36.180 --> 17:39.240
magnificent creature
in all of God's creation.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.880
Mr President, point of order.

17:40.940 --> 17:43.360
Oh, now it's fricken Gollum!

17:43.420 --> 17:46.040
May I point out
that Senator Greene's remarks

17:46.100 --> 17:47.520
are simply un-Australian.

17:47.580 --> 17:49.040
For a member of this chamber

17:49.100 --> 17:53.000
to suggest that any foreign animal
could be as majestic as a kangaroo

17:53.060 --> 17:56.080
is simply un-Australian
and I ask that it be withdrawn.

17:56.140 --> 17:57.960
Resume your seat, Senator Evans.

17:59.820 --> 18:01.760
OK, thank you.

18:02.700 --> 18:03.840
Oh! OK!

18:03.900 --> 18:07.040
Something isn't more beautiful
than something else

18:07.100 --> 18:09.240
just because it was
born in Australia.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.760
Well, it bloody well is!

18:10.820 --> 18:13.200
Well, you know, I mean,
I would probably find

18:13.260 --> 18:17.960
a syphilitic iguana more beautiful
on many levels than Senator Evans

18:18.020 --> 18:19.600
and she's an Australian animal.

18:19.660 --> 18:20.600
You're both warned!

18:20.660 --> 18:24.360
Mr President, I defer, of course, to
Senator Greene's obvious expertise

18:24.420 --> 18:26.600
when it comes to matters
of lizards and syphilis.

18:26.660 --> 18:28.120
You are both warned!

18:29.020 --> 18:31.920
Ooh! You right?
It's OK, don't worry.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.160
Yep.

18:33.220 --> 18:35.080
Ah, fuck you!

18:35.140 --> 18:39.960
Get myself up. Everybody, I'm fine!
Thank you for helping me.

18:40.020 --> 18:45.480
Now, I can see, just looking
around this chamber here today,

18:45.540 --> 18:50.520
I can see a look of utter
bewilderment on their faces

18:50.580 --> 18:56.560
as they're all clearly wondering
what is this mysterious connection

18:56.620 --> 19:01.600
between Botswanan independence
and the mighty zebra?

19:01.660 --> 19:03.200
Dave, Dave, Dave!

19:04.220 --> 19:05.760
Can you give that to the zebra?

19:05.820 --> 19:08.640
(PANTS)

19:11.060 --> 19:12.600
Oh, fuck!

19:16.940 --> 19:20.720
And so...we turn to history.

19:20.780 --> 19:22.240
WOMAN: Oh, please!

19:22.300 --> 19:25.120
And, Mr President...

19:26.940 --> 19:32.720
..I have here, uh, a list before me

19:32.780 --> 19:38.320
of six massive
foreign investment banks

19:38.380 --> 19:42.080
which are going to apply
for tax exemption

19:42.140 --> 19:45.120
under the amendments
before this chamber today.

19:45.180 --> 19:49.360
Now, each of these banks
seems to boast, on its website,

19:49.420 --> 19:53.400
that they started life
as a humble trading company

19:53.460 --> 19:56.280
in 19th-century Africa.

19:56.340 --> 19:59.920
And each of which, one might
therefore reasonably assume,

19:59.980 --> 20:04.040
is complicit in such matters as,
shall we say, slavery,

20:04.100 --> 20:06.400
shall we say, rape and pillage.

20:06.460 --> 20:10.680
What about the hunting down of
animals such as the noble zebra?

20:10.740 --> 20:13.480
The skinning of them, sending of
their hides back to Great Britain...

20:13.540 --> 20:14.720
Senator Greene, you're warned!

20:14.780 --> 20:18.480
..where they ended their days sadly,
pathetically,

20:18.540 --> 20:23.720
under the chubby pink buttocks
of the noble burghers of London.

20:23.780 --> 20:24.880
Senator, you have been warned!

20:24.940 --> 20:28.440
This, Mr President,
is the coat of arms,

20:28.500 --> 20:30.280
the proud coat of arms,

20:30.340 --> 20:32.920
of the British investment bank
Quist Farrow

20:32.980 --> 20:37.680
who apparently made
their first million pounds or so

20:37.740 --> 20:40.320
on the backs of the people
of Botswana.

20:40.380 --> 20:45.200
Mr President, I propose
that all Commonwealth nations

20:45.260 --> 20:47.320
boycott Quist Farrow

20:47.380 --> 20:49.560
and its brother money factories

20:49.620 --> 20:54.120
until taxes and reparations
are made with interest.

20:54.180 --> 20:56.000
And I further propose

20:56.060 --> 21:01.120
that this government
stops suckin' up to these banks!

21:01.180 --> 21:03.520
(SENATE PRESIDENT YELLS INAUDIBLY)

21:03.580 --> 21:06.880
This was supposed to be
a boring, dull as dishwater,

21:06.940 --> 21:09.680
nobody gives a shit set of amendments

21:09.740 --> 21:11.920
to an act nobody understands.

21:11.980 --> 21:14.160
Except our donors.
Precisely.

21:14.220 --> 21:17.080
And now, because of this clown,

21:17.140 --> 21:19.400
there is going to be
dedicated scrutiny

21:19.460 --> 21:20.880
of what we are doing.

21:20.940 --> 21:23.760
And dedicated scrutiny
is the last thing

21:23.820 --> 21:26.000
this government can afford right now.

21:26.060 --> 21:28.320
This was supposed to go through
on the voices.

21:28.380 --> 21:32.080
Now it is a shrieking fucking mess!

21:32.140 --> 21:34.600
I thought I had it all here at home

21:34.660 --> 21:38.520
but then a chance encounter
drew me to a Pacific island.

21:39.980 --> 21:43.760
These are just four of 200 kids

21:43.820 --> 21:46.880
I've been spending
six years helping,

21:46.940 --> 21:48.840
to varying degrees of success.

21:48.900 --> 21:51.600
I don't want to appear an ingrate,
Minister,

21:51.660 --> 21:55.200
but as grateful as I am
for the award,

21:55.260 --> 21:57.000
it's the kids that make me proud.

21:57.060 --> 21:58.960
Oh! Of course.

21:59.020 --> 22:01.200
(APPLAUSE)

22:10.820 --> 22:12.880
Wendy Greene?

22:12.940 --> 22:14.680
Oh!
I don't mean to impose.

22:14.740 --> 22:16.600
No. I-I mean, you're the minister.

22:16.660 --> 22:18.760
Hello. Nice to meet you.
Virginia Drake. How do you do?

22:18.820 --> 22:21.760
How do you do?
I'm so pleased to see you here.

22:21.820 --> 22:24.160
I'm not just a fan of your book.

22:24.220 --> 22:27.520
I believe that despite
all the bullshit claims of progress

22:27.580 --> 22:30.040
in terms of women's issues
and marital issues

22:30.100 --> 22:31.880
and the way we talk about women,

22:31.940 --> 22:35.040
that these are issues in dire need
of the ventilation you give them

22:35.100 --> 22:36.040
in the book.

22:36.100 --> 22:39.200
(LAUGHS) The ventilation?
Yes, the ventilation.

22:40.100 --> 22:43.240
I was wondering if you would like
to come to Canberra sometime.

22:43.300 --> 22:45.280
I'm trying to set up
a steering committee

22:45.340 --> 22:47.760
which would inform a white paper
on women's issues

22:47.820 --> 22:50.000
from a mental health perspective.

22:50.060 --> 22:51.480
And from what I've read,

22:51.540 --> 22:53.600
you just might be the person
to head that committee.

22:56.020 --> 22:57.320
Uh...

23:01.900 --> 23:04.520
(CHUCKLES) So guess what I did
today.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.040
What, my darling?

23:07.100 --> 23:09.280
I resigned from the Nats
and joined the Liberal Party.

23:10.180 --> 23:12.560
Really?
Yes, really.

23:12.620 --> 23:15.120
And now that that
Polish girl's carked it...

23:15.180 --> 23:17.120
Well, she's not dead.
Politically, she is.

23:17.180 --> 23:18.360
Yes. Yeah.

23:18.420 --> 23:20.320
Which means that there's
a casual vacancy in the Senate.

23:20.380 --> 23:22.720
I know China girl
was next on the ballot

23:22.780 --> 23:26.000
but it's really up to the PM
in the end, isn't it?

23:26.060 --> 23:28.440
That would be the case, yes.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.280
So you'll talk to her?

23:30.340 --> 23:32.120
Who. The PM?

23:33.420 --> 23:35.280
No, Beyonce, you idiot.

23:35.340 --> 23:36.880
You want the Senate seat?

23:36.940 --> 23:40.520
I want the old
Cal MacGregor magic back.

23:47.460 --> 23:48.640
Or...

23:52.100 --> 23:53.560
Oh.

23:57.260 --> 23:58.600
Huh?

23:59.540 --> 24:00.600
Huh?

24:00.660 --> 24:03.040
Mm-hm.
Pretty good.

24:03.100 --> 24:05.800
You were exceptional.

24:05.860 --> 24:07.760
Incredible work.

24:07.820 --> 24:09.880
We share this moment.

24:09.940 --> 24:12.400
Alright?
This is gold, boss.

24:12.460 --> 24:14.480
Can't wait to see
the morning tabloids.

24:14.540 --> 24:18.360
Well, big day.
I guess it must be beer o'clock.

24:18.420 --> 24:20.720
Float around the Members,
get the scuttlebutt.

24:20.780 --> 24:22.200
(HUMS)

24:24.140 --> 24:30.240
OK, so in the, um, in the spirit
of sharing this moment,

24:30.300 --> 24:32.520
this job is really hard

24:32.580 --> 24:34.480
without a press officer

24:34.540 --> 24:36.800
who still thinks that we're at war
with the Kaiser

24:36.860 --> 24:39.560
and that beer o'clock
is still a real thing.

24:39.620 --> 24:44.440
So please can we get someone
who has a Facebook account

24:44.500 --> 24:46.200
or just someone knows
what Facebook is?

24:46.260 --> 24:47.200
No.

24:48.580 --> 24:50.120
No, I'm sorry, Nicole.

24:50.180 --> 24:54.280
It's...it's called humanity, alright?
You should try it sometime.

24:54.340 --> 24:56.720
Cleaver, he's not a journalist.

24:56.780 --> 25:02.720
He covered league with the Sun
for 24 years of his life.

25:02.780 --> 25:06.360
Alright, well can we get him
an assistant perhaps?

25:06.420 --> 25:10.880
Just, please, please just anyone
who can say the word 'digital'

25:10.940 --> 25:14.320
without needing to say 'rectal'
because he finds it so funny.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.120
(LAUGHS)
Well, what about this.

25:16.180 --> 25:17.920
Can you get me an assistant?

25:17.980 --> 25:19.800
Because I can't do 100% of my job

25:19.860 --> 25:21.640
and 80% of your job

25:21.700 --> 25:23.360
and 95% of Frank's.

25:24.980 --> 25:28.000
Oh, come on! I mean, how much
do you owe his brother?

25:28.060 --> 25:29.360
OK.

25:29.420 --> 25:30.360
OK.

25:31.380 --> 25:32.800
Leave it with me.

25:33.820 --> 25:35.400
(SNEEZES)

25:37.820 --> 25:39.840
Senator Greene's suit pack, sir.

25:39.900 --> 25:42.120
Thanks very much.
The senator will be most relieved.

25:43.020 --> 25:47.160
Speaking of relief, may I avail
myself of the gentlemen's?

25:47.220 --> 25:48.760
Of course, sir.
Thank you.

26:13.820 --> 26:16.160
(WHISTLES)

26:45.580 --> 26:50.680
Now...what would his
impenetrable code be?

26:51.820 --> 26:53.080
Let's try this.

26:53.140 --> 26:55.280
1-1-1.

26:55.340 --> 26:57.000
(CHUCKLES)

27:05.980 --> 27:10.480
(WHISTLES)

27:19.580 --> 27:21.400
Oh, finally!

27:25.420 --> 27:30.560
Mate, these blackberries are the best
things I've ever had my mouth.

27:30.620 --> 27:32.200
I'm glad you're enjoying them.
Incredible.

27:33.020 --> 27:35.760
Oh, your phone beeped
a couple of times.

27:35.820 --> 27:38.200
Oh, right.
(SNEEZES) Ah, dammit.

27:39.300 --> 27:41.840
Pardon me.
(SIGHS)

27:41.900 --> 27:44.040
Oh, fuck. You are kidding me.

27:44.100 --> 27:46.280
So you're saying
my account's been shut down?

27:46.340 --> 27:50.240
Yes, you keep reminding me I missed
a payment in May and another in June

27:50.300 --> 27:53.640
but then I covered all that weeks
ago and now my account's in credit.

27:53.700 --> 27:55.400
OK, listen to me.

27:55.460 --> 27:59.400
So what you're saying is, you are
going to shut down my account

27:59.460 --> 28:03.280
and, what,
send me a cheque for $7.85?

28:03.340 --> 28:05.920
Where exactly am I meant to
stick that?

28:07.060 --> 28:08.600
I see.

28:11.140 --> 28:14.280
So...troubles with your bank?

28:15.220 --> 28:17.400
Yeah, they...they sacked me.

28:17.460 --> 28:18.880
I-I don't understand.

28:18.940 --> 28:20.840
My account was in credit.

28:21.820 --> 28:23.680
And your bank was?

28:23.740 --> 28:27.040
A-Next.
Whose primary shareholder is?

28:27.100 --> 28:29.600
I don't want to play
the suspense game.

28:29.660 --> 28:31.400
(SNEEZES)

28:31.460 --> 28:32.880
Quist Farrow.

28:32.940 --> 28:34.640
Pardon me.
Oh.

28:34.700 --> 28:36.720
The bank you were satirising today
in the parliament.

28:36.780 --> 28:38.560
They can't do that can they?

28:38.620 --> 28:41.000
Did you miss two payments?
Yes, I missed two.

28:41.060 --> 28:44.320
I mean, I'm always missing payments
but, you know, then I catch up.

28:44.380 --> 28:46.640
The government can't pay you cash.

28:46.700 --> 28:48.520
You need a bank account.

28:48.580 --> 28:50.680
Yeah, well, I'll just set up
a new bank account.

28:50.740 --> 28:53.600
OK. If you think you can.

28:53.660 --> 28:56.400
Senator Cleaver Greene.

28:56.460 --> 28:58.640
Open a bank account.

29:00.660 --> 29:03.160
Yeah. Are you a man or a machine?

29:04.700 --> 29:06.400
Oh, you're...oh, you're a man!

29:06.460 --> 29:07.920
OK, great.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.920
Alright, listen, mate, I want to do
business with your bank, alright?

29:10.980 --> 29:15.560
Yes, I can make a deposit of $7.85,
if that's what it takes.

29:15.620 --> 29:18.920
There are no credit issues, mate.

29:18.980 --> 29:24.200
Listen, sport, I am a senator in
the Australian Parliament, alri...

29:24.260 --> 29:26.040
(PHONE DISCONNECTS)
Hello?

29:28.180 --> 29:29.240
Unbelievable!

29:30.820 --> 29:35.440
We have good relations with Treasury
and the Department of Finance.

29:35.500 --> 29:36.760
Who's we?

29:36.820 --> 29:39.000
The drivers. We look after them.

29:39.060 --> 29:42.480
So you are saying
YOU could get me a bank account?

29:42.540 --> 29:46.160
I'm saying I could make
discreet enquiries,

29:46.220 --> 29:47.840
but it could take time.

29:47.900 --> 29:50.640
So in the meantime,
do you need some cash on hand?

29:50.700 --> 29:52.960
No, no, mate.
No, I couldn't do that.

29:53.020 --> 29:54.600
$200?
No.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.640
(PHONE RINGS)
Would that be enough for tonight?

29:57.820 --> 29:59.560
Hello?
Hi, hi.

29:59.620 --> 30:02.440
Um, are you free for dinner tonight?

30:02.500 --> 30:06.080
I've just had a chat
with the Health Minister,

30:06.140 --> 30:08.640
so I'm coming to Canberra
this afternoon for a meeting.

30:08.700 --> 30:10.640
The Health Minister? Oooooh!
Yeah.

30:10.700 --> 30:12.520
And I'd really like
to talk to you.

30:12.580 --> 30:14.920
Ah, you know, I've got a couple
of things on the schedule

30:14.980 --> 30:16.840
but I can probably push them off.

30:17.860 --> 30:21.200
Uh, what about that place
we went to last time,

30:21.260 --> 30:22.680
you know the guy with the hat?

30:22.740 --> 30:24.440
Yes. OK. Thanks.
I will see you there at 8:00.

30:24.500 --> 30:25.920
Lovely.

30:28.940 --> 30:31.560
You couldn't make that $300,
could you, mate?

30:31.620 --> 30:33.200
No problem.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.680
What's this?
Normal.

30:38.460 --> 30:40.720
Just sign and fill in your name.

30:40.780 --> 30:42.360
Don't trouble yourself
with the rest.

30:43.300 --> 30:46.640
Ah, alright. Very...very good.

30:46.700 --> 30:50.000
I suppose we should be
businesslike about this.

31:00.020 --> 31:01.480
Who are these idiots?

31:01.540 --> 31:04.040
They would be your latest
Buzz Stays.

31:04.100 --> 31:05.880
Is that today? Oh, no!

31:07.220 --> 31:09.120
Oh, fuck, there's a lot of them.

31:11.340 --> 31:12.880
Hello.

31:14.820 --> 31:17.280
Mr Greene, see, I am Ahmet.
Yes.

31:17.340 --> 31:18.840
I have the 2-week booking.

31:18.900 --> 31:21.160
Yes. Yes, Mr Ahmet.

31:21.220 --> 31:25.080
But you see here where it says
two...two guests only.

31:25.140 --> 31:29.720
And, yet, you seem to be
seven people.

31:29.780 --> 31:33.000
And I can't accommodate seven people
here.

31:33.060 --> 31:35.600
There are two beds here, alright,
and one of them is mine.

31:35.660 --> 31:37.760
No, this is a seven, not a two.

31:37.820 --> 31:39.240
Always meant to be the seven.

31:39.300 --> 31:41.000
Yes, no.

31:41.060 --> 31:42.440
Always a two.

31:42.500 --> 31:46.160
I mean, the dimensions of the space
would tell us that it's a two.

31:46.220 --> 31:47.400
It's two.

31:47.460 --> 31:49.600
My mother comes tomorrow
with her cousins.

31:49.660 --> 31:52.320
It means so much. Family again.

31:52.380 --> 31:56.360
Yes, well, that's lovely.
Family is...family is everything.

31:56.420 --> 31:59.960
How wonderful. Your mother must not
come here, though, with her cousins.

32:00.020 --> 32:02.040
No. No. Because of fire.

32:02.100 --> 32:04.000
There are fire laws. Laws.

32:04.060 --> 32:06.760
And I'm a senator. I am a senator.

32:06.820 --> 32:09.120
You are a senator?
I am a senator.

32:09.180 --> 32:11.320
Senator mush.
(ALL LAUGH)

32:11.380 --> 32:13.360
(SPEAKS TURKISH)

32:13.420 --> 32:14.720
(LAUGHS)

32:14.780 --> 32:16.760
Senator. Yes. So...
(PHONE RINGS)

32:18.620 --> 32:19.880
Hello.

32:19.940 --> 32:21.640
NICOLE: Um, you may want to
come back to the house.

32:21.700 --> 32:22.640
Why?

32:22.700 --> 32:25.160
Well, there is a little protest
out there

32:25.220 --> 32:28.600
at which Penny Evans is saying some
pretty shitty things about you

32:28.660 --> 32:30.760
and how you represent everything
that's wrong with the country.

32:30.820 --> 32:32.160
Oh, God, I hate her!

32:32.220 --> 32:33.880
Alright, I'll get changed.

32:33.940 --> 32:39.360
I've just been on Facebook and
the zebra has got a lot of likes.

32:39.420 --> 32:43.080
As Frank would tell you,
if he knew what Facebook was!

32:43.140 --> 32:46.040
Cleaver Greene is a city criminal.

32:46.100 --> 32:48.920
He does not know what it's like
to be a farmer!

32:48.980 --> 32:51.000
Her torture of the English language

32:51.060 --> 32:54.000
is currently under review
by the United Nations...

32:54.060 --> 32:55.240
..since he gave up drugs.

32:55.300 --> 32:56.720
IF he's given up drugs!

32:56.780 --> 32:58.600
Her personality
has all the magical colours

32:58.660 --> 33:00.320
of a decommissioned dialysis bag.

33:00.380 --> 33:01.680
Is taking from the regional poor

33:01.740 --> 33:05.000
and giving to
the drug-dealing city criminals!

33:05.060 --> 33:07.840
..whose maiden speech required
a sanctioned...

33:07.900 --> 33:10.240
Cleaver Greene
doesn't care about jobs.

33:10.300 --> 33:14.200
And within minutes the honourable
members were calling for oxygen

33:14.260 --> 33:17.880
and...and...and bleeding
from the ear.

33:17.940 --> 33:23.640
He has made vast sums of money
from trying to keep and keeping...

33:23.700 --> 33:25.680
(GUNSHOT)

33:25.740 --> 33:27.760
(SCREAMS)

33:41.980 --> 33:43.520
You're fucking kidding me!

33:43.580 --> 33:45.440
You're a witness
to a serious crime, Senator.

33:45.500 --> 33:48.040
There's nothing inappropriate about
interviewing a witness is there?

33:48.100 --> 33:49.520
No, no, nothing inappropriate.

33:49.580 --> 33:51.920
But it's just the fucking perp parade
in front of the press, mate,

33:51.980 --> 33:53.400
when you could have
done this in my office.

33:53.460 --> 33:55.680
This is political.
Don't think I don't know.

33:55.740 --> 33:58.080
So you guys, you better get ready to

33:58.140 --> 34:00.560
either pop one in the back of my head
or go down

34:00.620 --> 34:04.120
because I have been dealing with
fuckwits like you my whole life!

34:04.180 --> 34:05.960
We had no choice, Senator.

34:06.020 --> 34:08.360
You've been previously convicted
of conspiracy to commit murder.

34:08.420 --> 34:12.120
Acquitted on appeal, fuck sticks,
as well we know!

34:12.180 --> 34:13.600
My record is clean.

34:13.660 --> 34:16.360
I have...
She...she's not dead, is she?

34:16.420 --> 34:19.920
No. Shoulder. Flesh wound.
Admit it - you hate her.

34:19.980 --> 34:22.880
Who doesn't hate her?
I'm not Robinson Crusoe there, mate.

34:22.940 --> 34:24.920
I mean, there's a long line,
isn't there?

34:28.380 --> 34:30.080
Excuse us, please, for a moment,
would you, sir?

34:30.140 --> 34:31.560
Oh! Oh, righto, yep.

34:31.620 --> 34:33.960
I'll just, um,
I'll just entertain myself.

34:35.340 --> 34:36.480
(SIGHS)

34:37.820 --> 34:39.240
(DOOR OPENS)

34:50.380 --> 34:53.800
Cleaver, I'm here to help.

34:53.860 --> 34:55.720
Oh, I'm sure you are, mate.

34:57.300 --> 34:59.680
The optics,
they're a bit of a problem.

Are they? The optics?

35:01.300 --> 35:02.760
Yes, the optics.

35:02.820 --> 35:05.160
Plus we have, uh, hm...

35:05.220 --> 35:09.680
..certain footage of you naked
in front of young boys.

35:09.740 --> 35:12.440
Oh, come on, Gar! Fuck!

35:12.500 --> 35:13.760
It's politics.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.440
You must have known that
when you signed up.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.080
I didn't sign up, mate.

35:17.140 --> 35:19.240
I ran against my sister, alright,

35:19.300 --> 35:21.480
not the whole apparatus of
government.

35:21.540 --> 35:23.080
Well, if you want this to go easy,

35:23.140 --> 35:26.360
we will expect you to say and do
nothing for the rest of your term.

35:26.420 --> 35:30.480
My whole campaign was based on
saying and doing nothing, mate. Easy.

35:30.540 --> 35:32.440
And supporting the government
in the Senate.

35:32.500 --> 35:34.400
Or...

35:34.460 --> 35:36.840
..I will make it my business...

will be a living hell.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.200
It's your call.

35:43.260 --> 35:44.760
Supporting the government
on everything?

35:44.820 --> 35:46.240
On everything.

35:46.300 --> 35:49.080
This is a really
shithouse business, isn't it?

35:49.140 --> 35:51.720
I mean, I thought the law
was bad but...

35:51.780 --> 35:56.400
I mean, you're not a total
100% turd of a man.

But you're so close.
You're 98% there.

Wow!

36:17.460 --> 36:19.400
within a country mile
of Caitlin Farquhart again,

36:19.460 --> 36:21.200
I will hurt you.

her, even looking at her,

36:24.900 --> 36:27.280
even sharing the same air
she breathes,

36:27.340 --> 36:28.920
I will massacre you.

Hello, Minister.
Oh, Virginia, please.

36:59.580 --> 37:01.560
Have a seat.
Thank you.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.280
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

37:03.340 --> 37:05.400
Can we get you a drink of some kind?

37:05.460 --> 37:08.240
Just some water, thank you.
Thanks, Danielle.

37:08.300 --> 37:10.800
I'm so excited
about this new initiative.

37:10.860 --> 37:13.920
I'm... I mean, the government
wants to do something about

37:13.980 --> 37:15.360
reforming mental health,

37:15.420 --> 37:17.960
both in terms of its funding
and methodology,

37:18.020 --> 37:20.240
and I want you to be part of it.

37:23.220 --> 37:26.720
I'm so flattered, and I'm incredibly
excited, Virginister. Um...

37:29.140 --> 37:31.840
Sorry, Virginia.
Oh! (CHUCKLES)

Let me take you through
what I've been thinking.

about the dog!

You know, it's been a nightmare
trying to do this job,

37:47.580 --> 37:49.280
and maintain a cheery face,

37:49.340 --> 37:51.040
and go through this shit.

37:51.100 --> 37:53.720
You know, the nation's sick,
and I can't show stress,

37:53.780 --> 37:55.960
'cause it's a sign of weakness
in women, isn't it?

37:56.020 --> 37:57.400
Yeah, I just...

37:57.460 --> 38:01.120
Sounds like you've been having a
really tough time of it, Virginia,

38:01.180 --> 38:04.520
but in terms of a national mental
health strategy, I'm just...

38:04.580 --> 38:07.440
I'm not...
I love your book.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.200
I read it every night.

38:09.260 --> 38:13.040
But I can't go public
that I'm seeing someone.

38:13.100 --> 38:17.960
So I'm setting up a new
internal mental health division,

38:18.020 --> 38:19.520
to be headed by you.

38:19.580 --> 38:21.920
You'll have an office
and staff on this floor,

38:21.980 --> 38:25.160
so we can devise a new mental
health strategy for the nation.

plus all the other bullshit.

to me pretty much 24/7.

I have high ambitions, Wendy,
and I need someone to help me,

back in Sydney, Virginia, so...

I need you, Wendy.

Oh, God. Jesus.

38:54.180 --> 38:55.600
What were you doing in there, Wendy?

38:55.660 --> 38:57.080
I was just having a chat.

38:57.140 --> 39:01.320
You know that she's getting a
divorce? That she wants to be PM?

39:01.380 --> 39:02.560
She's basically crazy.

39:02.620 --> 39:06.160
Well, she might be, but she just
offered me a very interesting job.

39:06.220 --> 39:07.760
Are you going to take it?
I don't know.

39:07.820 --> 39:10.360
We're just in negotiations.
I haven't made a decision.

There's no rush.
Well, she's in a rush.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.600
Oh, what's that supposed to mean?

39:14.660 --> 39:16.840
Because I think that she's turning,
and I think that she likes you.

Maybe even two.

Mmm.

it depends on me.

Mm-hm.

with me, maybe?

Jack, I have told you
on numerous occasions,

39:39.860 --> 39:42.160
when you display some signs
of emotional sanity,

then I will consider
going out with you.

for telling you this.

that you want her and Winsome
to come and stay with you,

43:17.580 --> 43:19.000
and that you will find her a job,

43:19.060 --> 43:20.840
and they can stay
as long as they like,

he's going to do.

You take advantage of my kindness,
and that is a form of abuse.

43:32.220 --> 43:34.760
But see, if you're...if you're
moving to Canberra...

43:34.820 --> 43:35.760
Mmm.

43:35.820 --> 43:37.320
..why can't they all just stay
at your place?

43:37.380 --> 43:39.280
Oh, my God. Have you not listened
to a single word I've said?

43:39.340 --> 43:41.400
Or Fuzz. Fuzz could rent from you -
something.

43:41.460 --> 43:42.680
Alright, I don't know for sure,

43:42.740 --> 43:44.920
but I think Fuzz has got another
woman in America, doubtless older,

43:44.980 --> 43:48.960
and that is why he is, as you
so consistently were, absent.

43:49.020 --> 43:51.680
OK? So I guess I will
see you around.

43:51.740 --> 43:54.560
What? Whoa, hey, whoa.

third and a quarter of one of those,

44:30.220 --> 44:33.800
you turned me into Dr Evil

a little game with you.

45:12.340 --> 45:15.120
Oh, you already are, Cleaver.
Mm-hm.

45:15.180 --> 45:18.320
Alright, I'll make it easier
for you. Name a...name a suburb.

45:19.700 --> 45:21.000
Toorak.

45:21.060 --> 45:23.280
Toorak. 3142.

45:24.460 --> 45:27.120
Darling, that coat is divine.

45:27.180 --> 45:29.080
Did Johnny whip it up for you?

45:29.140 --> 45:31.640
If he did,
he is borderline roadkill to me.

45:31.700 --> 45:33.120
Never speaking to him again!

45:34.500 --> 45:37.400
So you're bullshit, is that right?

45:37.460 --> 45:39.440
You're... Are you...?
You're complete bullshit.

45:39.500 --> 45:41.840
No, I believe every word I say.

45:41.900 --> 45:43.880
But what you say is not important.

45:43.940 --> 45:45.640
It's not the issue.
It's how you say it.

45:45.700 --> 45:48.000
People want us to be just like them.
No, they don't.

45:48.060 --> 45:51.480
The last thing I want is
for my politicians to be like me,

45:51.540 --> 45:54.520
even though, as me, I am one.

45:54.580 --> 45:56.440
I want them to be better.

45:56.500 --> 45:58.440
Well, most people don't.

45:58.500 --> 46:00.960
So what's your real postcode?

46:01.020 --> 46:04.080
4405 - the gorgeous Darling Downs.

46:05.060 --> 46:08.600
So I didn't lie when I said
I was from farming country.

46:08.660 --> 46:10.360
What I omitted to say was that

46:10.420 --> 46:13.200
it was one of the biggest
agricultural concerns in Queensland,

46:13.260 --> 46:15.360
and my father was very wealthy.

46:15.420 --> 46:17.840
But no-one asked,
because they're myopic, the press,

46:17.900 --> 46:19.720
and they're stupid.

46:19.780 --> 46:23.000
I did go to the local public school
until I was 10,

46:23.060 --> 46:25.360
and then on to St Margaret's -
very hoity-toity.

46:25.420 --> 46:28.000
And then Sydney University -
arts/law.

46:28.060 --> 46:29.800
Arts/law at Sydney?
Mmm.

46:29.860 --> 46:31.720
But under my maiden name.

46:31.780 --> 46:36.120
You see, I was married twice,
once at 19 and once at 21,

46:36.180 --> 46:37.960
both regrettably briefly.

46:38.020 --> 46:40.760
I don't...I don't understand
how you can keep this secret.

46:40.820 --> 46:43.080
What about your friends
and people who knew you?

46:43.140 --> 46:44.800
Well, they're all pretty much
paid-up members

46:44.860 --> 46:46.280
of the Penny Evans Party.

46:46.340 --> 46:48.440
(LAUGHS) Yeah, but not
all of them are.

46:48.500 --> 46:50.400
What about the people
who aren't paid-up members

46:50.460 --> 46:51.880
of the Penny Evans's Party?

46:51.940 --> 46:54.760
Well, the people who aren't paid-up
members of the Penny Evans Party

46:54.820 --> 46:56.800
know how to lead a quiet life.

46:58.980 --> 47:02.520
You see, Cleaver,
I'm this nation's Trump.

47:03.820 --> 47:06.280
My base will never desert me.

47:06.340 --> 47:09.040
It can only build,
as I build a nation.

47:09.100 --> 47:12.080
So you gamed it out.

47:12.140 --> 47:14.200
I want to change the country,
Cleaver.

47:15.580 --> 47:17.120
I don't want to herd sheep.

47:19.380 --> 47:21.160
Not that there's anything
wrong with that.

47:23.180 --> 47:24.840
Are you going to pay for these?

47:28.580 --> 47:30.320
(SIGHS)

47:42.820 --> 47:44.480
(SIGHS)

47:56.540 --> 47:58.080
(SIGHS)

48:00.060 --> 48:02.920
(BANGING)

48:02.980 --> 48:04.040
Mr Ahmet?

48:04.100 --> 48:05.560
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

48:30.500 --> 48:32.520
Good morning, sir. My name is Leon.

48:32.580 --> 48:34.880
Mr Jakob sends his apologies,
but is not well,

48:34.940 --> 48:36.440
and would not wish you
to catch any bugs.

48:36.500 --> 48:37.680
Ah.

48:37.740 --> 48:39.680
OK, well, thank you, Leon.

48:41.820 --> 48:45.680
Uh...and he said to tell you
he had made some calls.

48:45.740 --> 48:47.120
Did he?

48:47.180 --> 48:49.720
Excellent. Excellent.

48:49.780 --> 48:53.000
The people you didn't
want in your home, they have gone?

48:53.060 --> 48:57.200
Yes, yeah. They...oh, they've...
They seem to have vanished.

48:57.260 --> 49:02.600
Did he, uh...mention anything
to you about banking?

49:04.420 --> 49:05.960
No, sir.

49:07.060 --> 49:11.280
Mmm. Phwoar. Very peckish.

49:12.180 --> 49:14.520
Would you like to stop
for some breakfast and coffee?

49:14.580 --> 49:16.360
Oh, well...
Mr Jakob told me.

49:16.420 --> 49:17.960
Let's just have a...

49:18.020 --> 49:19.440
(SIGHS)

49:20.580 --> 49:22.000
Mmm...

49:22.060 --> 49:23.520
No, no, that's...that's fine, mate.

49:23.580 --> 49:26.600
I don't...I don't need...
I don't need food.

49:26.660 --> 49:29.320
(GIRLS CHATTER)

49:36.100 --> 49:39.080
Oh, mate,
you don't have any coins do you?

49:39.140 --> 49:41.480
I apologise, sir, just cards.

49:41.540 --> 49:43.680
Ah, yes, the cashless
freaking economy.

49:44.820 --> 49:47.600
Would you like to save the future
by acknowledging the past?

49:47.660 --> 49:49.800
I really would.

49:49.860 --> 49:51.800
Do I just have to acknowledge it?

49:51.860 --> 49:53.920
Well, the acknowledgement
is traditionally accompanied

49:53.980 --> 49:55.400
by a donation.

49:55.460 --> 49:58.320
Oh, damn it. Oh, I'm out of cash.

49:58.380 --> 49:59.840
I've just, uh...

49:59.900 --> 50:02.640
You don't take cards, I suppose?
Yes, we do!

50:02.700 --> 50:03.640
You do?

50:03.700 --> 50:05.280
Will that be savings,
cash or credit?

50:05.340 --> 50:07.400
Uh...well, that's...um...

50:07.460 --> 50:09.000
(MUTTERS)

50:09.060 --> 50:10.280
Oh, damn it.

50:10.340 --> 50:12.000
No. You wouldn't, um...

50:12.060 --> 50:14.520
That's expired. Alright, now listen.

50:14.580 --> 50:16.400
You just hold on there for a minute.

50:16.460 --> 50:18.840
I'm going to zip in there,
come right back out

50:18.900 --> 50:20.720
and get one of those things.

50:20.780 --> 50:23.440
Yep.
Because I am going to acknowledge.

50:23.500 --> 50:24.760
REPORTER: Senator Greene,

50:24.820 --> 50:26.680
how long are you going to keep
this little girl waiting?

50:26.740 --> 50:28.240
Senator Greene?

50:34.420 --> 50:36.000
(GROANS)

50:38.220 --> 50:39.440
(GROANS)

50:55.580 --> 50:57.800
Ah. Mm.

51:08.820 --> 51:10.080
Mm.

51:12.820 --> 51:16.120
You never told me about these
free breakfast "Friends of" dealies.

51:16.180 --> 51:18.240
Yeah, well, you said you didn't
want to know about anything

51:18.300 --> 51:19.400
unless it paid.

51:19.460 --> 51:22.120
Well, that's...I mean,
it's free food! Hello!

51:22.180 --> 51:24.000
Does that shit happen every morning?

51:24.060 --> 51:26.840
Yeah. If you came before noon,
you'd know that.

51:26.900 --> 51:28.160
I think there's a...

51:28.220 --> 51:30.080
There's a Parliamentary friends
of Palestine in five,

51:30.140 --> 51:33.880
and later there's a big lunch for
Parliamentary friends of Star Trek

51:33.940 --> 51:35.360
in the Chancellor's room.

51:35.420 --> 51:36.960
No, no, no, I'm full as a goog.

51:37.020 --> 51:40.000
Put me down for Star Trek, though.
OK.

51:40.060 --> 51:42.480
I need the float, please.
Where's the float?

51:42.540 --> 51:44.400
No, I've forbidden you from
touching the float, Cleaver.

51:44.460 --> 51:46.080
Oh, that's ridiculous.
That's just controlling.

51:46.140 --> 51:47.760
OK, you can sort this out.

51:47.820 --> 51:49.560
Take a half of our float

51:49.620 --> 51:53.360
and go and give it to one of those
little Christine people, please.

51:53.420 --> 51:54.920
They're called Caroline Girls.

51:54.980 --> 51:56.400
Caroline Girls.

51:56.460 --> 51:59.400
Take...take a third...a quarter
of our float

51:59.460 --> 52:00.920
and go and give it to one of them.

52:00.980 --> 52:03.200
And don't make a big fuss
that it's from me.

52:03.260 --> 52:05.760
(WHISPERS) As long as
everybody knows it's from me.

52:05.820 --> 52:07.600
(WHISPERS) OK.

52:07.660 --> 52:10.080
And Caitlin wants you on her show
this evening.

52:10.140 --> 52:11.280
Caitlin?
Yep.

52:11.340 --> 52:12.520
Tell her to go to hell.

52:12.580 --> 52:15.680
Well, there is rumour the PM's
going to dump the Senate President

52:15.740 --> 52:17.480
and replace him with a crossbencher,
so...

52:17.540 --> 52:19.080
Whatever, whatever.
Oh, whatever.

52:19.140 --> 52:22.600
Yeah, whatever.
Only 250K more, Cleaver.

52:22.660 --> 52:26.160
Private dining room,
lots of fact-finders overseas.

52:27.820 --> 52:29.520
Senator Evans,

52:29.580 --> 52:32.000
let me start by saying
we are so relieved

52:32.060 --> 52:34.960
you survived that shocking
assassination attempt,

52:35.020 --> 52:38.000
which followed a heated exchange
between you both.

52:38.060 --> 52:39.600
Well, thank you, Caitlin.

52:39.660 --> 52:42.480
Yes, I'm no stranger
to the threat that attaches itself

52:42.540 --> 52:44.160
to trying to make
Australia great again.

52:44.220 --> 52:50.400
Yes, I roundly condemn the attempt
against Senator Evans's life,

52:50.460 --> 52:54.080
although I do believe
it was actually intended for me.

52:54.140 --> 52:55.680
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

52:55.740 --> 52:57.240
Well, word around Canberra is

52:57.300 --> 52:59.880
the PM is going to dump
Senate President James Jordan

52:59.940 --> 53:02.120
and replace him with a crossbencher.

53:02.180 --> 53:05.320
Do either of you want to become
president of the Senate,

53:05.380 --> 53:08.200
a well-paid job for a eunuch,
as some have described it?

53:08.260 --> 53:10.480
Ah.
Well, look, Caitlin.

53:10.540 --> 53:12.920
Any government that would
contemplate a drug-addled murderer

53:12.980 --> 53:14.400
as president of the Senate

53:14.460 --> 53:16.360
needs to be chucked out
on its ear, because...

53:16.420 --> 53:18.040
Yeah, overturned.
Overturned on appeal.

53:18.100 --> 53:20.320
Senator Greene is a grub
without a conscience.

53:20.380 --> 53:22.560
He is a liar without a heart,

53:22.620 --> 53:25.280
and a beast with absolutely
no beauty whatsoever.

53:25.340 --> 53:28.680
He is a lazy, lying, selfish nobody,

53:28.740 --> 53:31.400
and the really sad thing about that,
Caitlin, is he doesn't even know it.

53:31.460 --> 53:35.120
Cleaver Greene, are you a
lazy, selfish, lying nobody?

53:35.180 --> 53:37.520
Well, Caitlin, Penny Evans -

53:37.580 --> 53:40.600
which is not her original name,
by the way -

53:40.660 --> 53:42.120
is beyond delusional.

53:42.180 --> 53:45.880
She is actually
a straight up and down liar.

53:45.940 --> 53:47.760
She's been lying to all of us,

53:47.820 --> 53:50.600
her constituents in particular,
for years now.

53:50.660 --> 53:55.320
Her modest farming family that
she bangs on about all the time

53:55.380 --> 53:56.760
turns out to have been

53:56.820 --> 53:59.040
one of Australia's biggest
agricultural concerns.

53:59.100 --> 54:04.400
She attended the elite St Margaret's
private girls school,

54:04.460 --> 54:08.680
and Sydney University, where she...
she studied arts and law,

54:08.740 --> 54:10.600
and married frequently,

54:10.660 --> 54:14.480
a fact not detected by you
or your colleagues, Caitlin.

54:14.540 --> 54:18.800
She's been lying
to all of us to create a persona,

54:18.860 --> 54:23.760
a persona that is politically
palatable to a certain constituency.

54:23.820 --> 54:29.120
She is a 100%,
dyed-in-the-wool fraud.

54:29.180 --> 54:30.320
Penny Evans?

54:30.380 --> 54:32.040
You know, this isn't the first time

54:32.100 --> 54:33.800
Senator Greene has pulled a stunt
like this.

54:33.860 --> 54:36.760
Mainly during his time
as a criminal barrister.

54:36.820 --> 54:38.240
So, Caitlin, I've come prepared.

54:40.820 --> 54:43.480
Here is my Dad's farm.

54:44.620 --> 54:48.680
Here are some shots of me
in my class at Bundaroo High.

54:48.740 --> 54:51.320
(CHUCKLES) I wouldn't even know
where... What was it?

54:51.380 --> 54:53.600
..St Margaret's was.

54:53.660 --> 54:58.320
Here is my HSC certificate,
again stating Bundaroo High.

54:58.380 --> 55:00.880
I mean, Sydney University -
give me a break. (CHUCKLES)

55:00.940 --> 55:02.680
I've never been married.

55:02.740 --> 55:05.040
And, to finish off,
I have a pile of stat decs

55:05.100 --> 55:08.720
from my friends, relations,
colleagues and neighbours,

55:08.780 --> 55:10.720
who will confirm my identity

55:10.780 --> 55:13.440
and the history of my life
as I've told it today.

55:15.020 --> 55:16.920
So I think, Senator Greene,

55:16.980 --> 55:19.440
you'll be hearing from my lawyers
as early as tomorrow morning,

55:19.500 --> 55:23.160
because no-one calls me a bald-faced
liar and doesn't pay for it.

55:27.060 --> 55:29.280
You're a piece of work,
aren't you?

55:29.340 --> 55:31.040
I know.

55:31.100 --> 55:34.000
A very attractive piece of work,
but a piece of work.

55:34.060 --> 55:36.120
Now is not the time, Cleaver.

55:36.180 --> 55:38.080
Get your make-up off. Relax.

55:43.100 --> 55:44.800
Do you just want to excuse
the Senator and myself

55:44.860 --> 55:45.800
for a moment, please?

55:51.580 --> 55:53.120
(SIGHS)

55:54.900 --> 55:56.240
(SMACK!)

55:56.300 --> 56:00.080
Sir, I'm sorry, you need 100 points
of ID to open a proper account.

56:00.140 --> 56:02.600
This...this is my passport.
Mm-hm.

56:02.660 --> 56:05.080
OK, how many points do you want?
How many points is that?

56:05.140 --> 56:07.560
I've got receipts. I mean, that's...
Yeah, it's expired.

56:07.620 --> 56:09.400
I'm sorry, sir, you don't have
the hundred points.

56:09.460 --> 56:10.960
I'm a Commonwealth senator.

56:11.020 --> 56:13.440
Are you telling me that there is
not a single account in this place

56:13.500 --> 56:14.520
that you can open for me?

56:14.580 --> 56:15.600
No, sir.

56:15.660 --> 56:18.240
OK, what about your Tiny Tycoon
Super Saver?

56:18.300 --> 56:19.920
Well, you're neither tiny
nor a tycoon.

56:19.980 --> 56:21.520
I am a tycoon!
Oh, really?

56:21.580 --> 56:22.960
Yes! And I'm tiny.

56:23.020 --> 56:25.160
Look, I'm a tiny tycoon.

56:25.220 --> 56:26.640
How bad is this?

56:26.700 --> 56:28.840
How bad is this fucking place?
Security!

56:28.900 --> 56:30.160
Look at me.
Security!

56:30.220 --> 56:32.200
I'm a fucking tiny tycoon.

56:32.260 --> 56:34.480
I'm a member
of the Australian Parliament,

56:34.540 --> 56:36.840
and I've had it up to pussy's bow
with this shit!

56:36.900 --> 56:41.960
Why are we putting up with
this abuse from these leeches?!

56:44.580 --> 56:45.960
Hey!

56:46.020 --> 56:47.400
That's my head!

56:49.300 --> 56:51.600
Mate, give me back my head!
(COINS SCATTER)

56:51.660 --> 56:54.880
I'm not going to get my bloody
deposit back, you bastard!

56:54.940 --> 57:08.600
Give it back!
Give it back, you bastard!

57:08.620 --> 57:11.840
Following a successful leadership
challenge in the party room,

57:11.900 --> 57:13.680
I have been elected the leader

57:13.740 --> 57:15.400
of the Federal Parliamentary
Liberal Party.

57:15.460 --> 57:16.920
There's about to be a coup.

57:16.980 --> 57:18.480
What, a coup in Parliament?

57:18.540 --> 57:19.840
A quantum power shift

57:19.900 --> 57:22.120
with massive implications
for this country at large.

57:22.180 --> 57:23.600
Senator Cleaver Greene.

57:23.660 --> 57:25.840
I was your fellow speaker here today.

57:25.900 --> 57:27.080
Ah. Li-Ming Wu.

57:27.140 --> 57:28.560
This ice-cream,

57:28.620 --> 57:32.600
that has been so much a part of
the lives of ordinary Australians,

57:32.660 --> 57:34.960
will slip through
Noyce Industry's hands,

57:35.020 --> 57:38.840
and into the clutches
of the Communist regime.
