00:34.034 --> 00:36.495
Fuck Swearnet and fuck you.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.372
Huh. Good morning to you fellows too.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.207
Go fuck yourself. Morning.

00:40.248 --> 00:42.167
Well, worthless

00:42.209 --> 00:44.795
and weak fucking performance in Helsinki.

00:44.837 --> 00:47.506
Well, for fuck's sakes, I don't know what

00:44.837 --> 00:47.506
everybody expects.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.884
The fucking tasks are almost impossible.

00:49.925 --> 00:52.177
It's fucked! I just want to go

00:49.925 --> 00:52.177
the fuck home.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.804
The good news is,

00:53.846 --> 00:56.431
last day to make some real money here.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.475
Here's your tasks for today.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.060
Can't believe I'm in fucking Amsterdam.

01:00.101 --> 01:02.229
I'm so stressed out, I'm not even going

01:00.101 --> 01:02.229
to enjoy it.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.856
I've dreamt of coming here my whole life!

01:03.898 --> 01:05.607
"Task number 1:

01:05.649 --> 01:07.735
"pick out traditional Dutch clogs

01:07.776 --> 01:10.237
and wear them for the day, 25 bucks."

01:10.278 --> 01:12.239
Okay, there's an easy 25, at least.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.199
What the fuck are those? They're fucking

01:12.280 --> 01:14.199
uncomfortable, man.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.201
That's what they are. The big wooden

01:14.241 --> 01:16.201
shoes, Ricky.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.370
Big wooden things. It's fucked,

01:16.243 --> 01:18.370
but it's easy. Okay.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.040
"Number 2: ride a three-person bike to...

01:21.081 --> 01:24.125
"from regular-ward-strut to..."

01:24.167 --> 01:26.754
wherever the fuck that is, 25 bucks.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.590
Okay, easy, ride a three-person bike.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.590
We've done that before.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.508
"Coupons and maps enclosed." All right.

01:31.550 --> 01:35.596
"Number 3: meet Crosby, Stills and Nash"?

01:35.637 --> 01:38.515
"And sing a song with them for $1,000"?

01:38.557 --> 01:40.475
We're going to meet Crosby, Stills and Nash?

01:40.517 --> 01:42.310
I doubt it, but Swearnet was kind enough

01:42.352 --> 01:43.979
to get you boys tickets

01:44.021 --> 01:46.648
and passes to tonight's performance.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.648
Holy fuck!

01:46.690 --> 01:48.817
We're never going to get them to fucking sing

01:46.690 --> 01:48.817
a song with us, Bubs.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.028
Look at that. That's a real pass!

01:51.070 --> 01:53.572
To Crosby, Stills & Nash!

01:53.614 --> 01:55.783
What's the fourth one? There isn't a fourth one.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.492
(Paper tearing)

01:57.534 --> 01:59.995
There was a fourth one. There wasn't. It just...

01:57.534 --> 01:59.995
It ended at three.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.122
Okay, well I don't really give

02:00.037 --> 02:02.122
a fuck about this.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.416
Let's go do something easy and get some

02:02.163 --> 02:04.416
fucking money

02:04.458 --> 02:06.585
so I can go to a coffee shop, please.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.796
Well, let's start with the clogs.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.796
Ricky: All right.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.839
Let's do the clogs. (Indistinct)

02:08.837 --> 02:10.839
...food.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.466
Decent!

02:12.507 --> 02:14.009
Good luck, shit-rats.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.469
Bubbles: Jesus, that guy's mean.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.140
Okay, boys. It should be right up here.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.892
It should be an easy 25 for us.

02:21.934 --> 02:24.269
Why would they even make shoes out of trees?

02:24.311 --> 02:26.021
I know. They're stupid! Why would you do that?

02:24.311 --> 02:26.021
It's fucked.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.941
Because they're fucking dry, and it

02:26.063 --> 02:28.941
rains a lot here.

02:28.983 --> 02:32.069
Those are dry. Wood shoes are

02:28.983 --> 02:32.069
dry and comfy.

02:32.111 --> 02:34.404
They're not going to be comfortable.

02:32.111 --> 02:34.404
They're wood.

02:34.446 --> 02:36.448
Well, that's what... Holy fuck!

02:34.446 --> 02:36.448
Holy shit!

02:36.490 --> 02:38.867
Look at this. It's like clog

02:36.490 --> 02:38.867
heaven in here.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.410
Julian: I'm glad you're excited.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.079
Bubbles: Decent. So it's Just...

02:42.121 --> 02:45.916
It says, "Pick out three pairs of

02:42.121 --> 02:45.916
traditional clogs."

02:45.958 --> 02:47.960
(Sigh) For fuck's sakes...

02:45.958 --> 02:47.960
What do you think?

02:49.503 --> 02:51.421
Get these fucking things and get it over with.

02:51.463 --> 02:53.423
Ohhh, I'm going to take these ones.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.425
Which ones? Those ones I was

02:53.465 --> 02:55.425
going to take.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.094
Well, they match me. You should wear red.

02:57.136 --> 02:59.346
Red'll match your shirt. Those are like

02:57.136 --> 02:59.346
the Elvis ones.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.556
I'd like to have those. Elvis wouldn't be wearing

02:59.387 --> 03:01.556
something like that.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.351
No, but if he did... He wouldn't.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.394
Here, I can take red, I guess.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.729
So what do we do with these?

03:07.771 --> 03:09.940
I've got a coupon here from Swearnet.

03:09.982 --> 03:11.900
Hello, guys. Hi there.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.318
Hi...

03:13.360 --> 03:15.737
I've got a coupon here from Swearnet.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.238
Show me.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.033
Yes...

03:19.074 --> 03:21.200
All right. We've got to leave

03:19.074 --> 03:21.200
our shoes here, boys,

03:21.242 --> 03:22.619
it says on the thing.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.496
Those bastards! For fuck's sakes...

03:24.538 --> 03:26.247
Well, that's how they're...

03:24.538 --> 03:26.247
I know.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.833
not actually giving them to us.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.877
They think you're so goddamn smart.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.877
For you?

03:29.918 --> 03:32.880
He's going to take the blue ones.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.715
Ricky: (Sarcastic) Wooden shoes!

03:34.756 --> 03:36.633
Julian: Good times.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.633
Quite a fucking thing.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.552
Bubbles: Do you wear these yourself?

03:36.675 --> 03:38.552
Are they nice?

03:38.593 --> 03:40.387
Julian: Boys, we look like dicks.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.347
We look dumb but they're actually not that bad.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.224
We sound like horses, too.

03:44.265 --> 03:46.560
(Clunking footsteps)

03:46.601 --> 03:50.064
All right. What's next?

03:50.105 --> 03:52.066
Well, according to this,

03:52.107 --> 03:54.651
we've got to go ride that three-person bike.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.653
Let's just get it over with.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.780
Let's get some money. I need to eat.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.780
I'm fucking starving.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.616
And we need hash, badly. Well, let's go.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.744
I think clogs are cool, myself.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.913
I think they're, you know, nice and colourful.

04:05.954 --> 04:09.249
And this is something like rock stars would

04:05.954 --> 04:09.249
wear, in my opinion.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.169
And ladies dig them too. I'm pretty sure.

04:12.211 --> 04:14.421
We look like a boy band.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.548
Nobody else is wearing these fucking things.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.430
Ricky: Where the fuck did

04:21.302 --> 04:23.430
this rain come from?

04:23.471 --> 04:25.390
Amsterdam, Ricky. Apparently it rains,

04:25.432 --> 04:27.893
and goes away, and rains...

04:27.935 --> 04:29.770
It's saying it should be right up here.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.605
Ricky: I can't believe how many

04:29.811 --> 04:31.605
fucking bikes are here.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.607
Julian: There's the fucking

04:31.646 --> 04:33.607
bike right there.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.442
Hey, buddy. That's pretty cool.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.360
You from Swearnet? Yeah...

04:35.483 --> 04:37.360
(Indistinct)

04:37.402 --> 04:39.571
All right. We're supposed to take

04:37.402 --> 04:39.571
this and go to here?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.115
Where? Right to there.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.824
To there? Yeah.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.701
Oh, it's straight here, guys.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.701
Just right there?

04:44.743 --> 04:46.787
You can make it. Yeah.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.787
All right.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.164
You'll have a lot of fun there. They'll

04:46.828 --> 04:49.164
love you guys over there.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.498
Oh, yeah? Cool. Cool.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.498
Great.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.042
Who's driving?

04:52.084 --> 04:53.794
You are, Ricky. All right!

04:53.835 --> 04:55.879
I've never been on one of these fucking

04:53.835 --> 04:55.879
things before.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.589
Yes, you have. Don't kill us, Ricky.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.799
Put up the kick stand.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.759
(Grunt) Jesus Christ...

05:00.801 --> 05:03.178
All right, boys. Oh, wait. I lost

05:00.801 --> 05:03.178
a fucking shoe.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.846
Okay. We good?

05:04.888 --> 05:06.765
I think so. Man:

05:04.888 --> 05:06.765
Good luck, guys!

05:06.807 --> 05:08.516
Thank you.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.144
Fuck... This is cool!

05:10.185 --> 05:11.519
Do not kill us, Ricky!

05:11.561 --> 05:14.355
I'll try not to, boys. Whoo!

05:14.397 --> 05:16.275
Bubbles: This is going to be

05:14.397 --> 05:16.275
easy money, boys.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.651
Fucking right!

05:19.236 --> 05:22.281
Julian: Take a left, Rick.

05:19.236 --> 05:22.281
Left, left. Right up here.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.490
Ricky: Fuck!

05:23.531 --> 05:25.284
Man: Should I lick your balls?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.661
Man 2: (Speaking in Dutch)

05:27.702 --> 05:29.454
Bubbles: What?

05:27.702 --> 05:29.454
Man 2: (Continuing in Dutch)

05:29.496 --> 05:31.165
Did you hear what that guy...?

05:31.206 --> 05:32.874
Man: (Speaking in Dutch)

05:31.206 --> 05:32.874
What are they talking about?

05:32.916 --> 05:34.334
Man: You want to get

05:32.916 --> 05:34.334
your cock sucked?

05:34.375 --> 05:35.919
Bubbles: My cock?

05:35.961 --> 05:37.712
I like to think I'm pretty liberal in my views.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.506
I don't judge anybody.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.382
And I think I can handle any situation.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.678
But you get a big group of, you know, young, fit fellows

05:44.719 --> 05:47.555
yelling at you, saying, "Hey, show us your wiener!",

05:47.597 --> 05:49.516
you get flustered pretty quick.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.392
If they had just kept it to whistling, you know,

05:51.434 --> 05:52.686
I probably would have been a little flattered

05:52.727 --> 05:53.979
but some of the shit they were saying

05:54.021 --> 05:55.689
was really, really fucking aggressive.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.357
Man 3: Let us fuck your strong

05:55.730 --> 05:58.357
American mouths.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.152
Okay, that's enough!

06:00.194 --> 06:02.654
Julian: Just get us out of here.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.654
Get us the fuck out of here.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.656
Double time, boys. Double time.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.656
Heave it.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.201
Fucking chain came off.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.870
Various: Fuck. Push.  Chain's off. I'll push, I'll

06:07.242 --> 06:09.870
push. Keep pushing.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.705
Man: (In Dutch)...licker.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.705
What?

06:11.746 --> 06:13.207
Okay, that's enough!

06:13.248 --> 06:14.499
(Quivering) Come on, boys.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.501
Push, Julian. Get us out of Blowjob Alley!

06:18.253 --> 06:19.838
Hey, boys. There's Mayhue.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.506
There's Mayhue. Slow down.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.382
Thank fuck. We did it!

06:23.424 --> 06:25.219
Nice. How did you boys enjoy that?

06:25.260 --> 06:27.095
That was good except you sent us through

06:25.260 --> 06:27.095
the gay neighbourhood

06:27.137 --> 06:28.972
and we're not gay. I don't pick the route.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.141
Comes from the head office of Swearnet.

06:31.183 --> 06:34.228
Well, we did it. So do we get paid?

06:31.183 --> 06:34.228
We rode the route.

06:34.269 --> 06:36.104
You're gonna get paid. Yes!

06:34.269 --> 06:36.104
In fact,

06:36.146 --> 06:37.898
I'm going to pay you guys now so

06:36.146 --> 06:37.898
you get some food.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.316
I don't want to see you creeps

06:37.939 --> 06:39.316
starving here.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.235
Oh, thank you. Right, get

06:39.358 --> 06:41.235
your game on.

06:41.276 --> 06:43.402
Let's get some hash and get some

06:41.276 --> 06:43.402
food, boys. Whoo!

06:43.444 --> 06:45.404
Food! No, no, no,

06:43.444 --> 06:45.404
I'm getting a drink first.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.199
Coffee shop. We're getting some hash.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.199
Liquor first.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.407
We're in fucking Amsterdam!

06:48.449 --> 06:50.118
(Mixed shouting)

06:50.160 --> 06:51.328
Food!

06:51.370 --> 06:52.746
Liquor!

06:52.787 --> 06:54.789
Hash! Food.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.789
I've got the money.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.750
Bubbles: You're also the one that the

06:54.831 --> 06:56.750
guys were saying

06:56.791 --> 06:58.960
they wanted to blow the most too.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.423
Okay, boys. We've got, like, fucking 8 euros

07:01.629 --> 07:04.423
each basically,

07:04.465 --> 07:06.009
so let's get some food.

07:04.465 --> 07:06.009
Well,

07:06.051 --> 07:07.844
if you look at the math though,

07:06.051 --> 07:07.844
there's an extra Europe.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.097
No, no, no, no... There's 8+8+8...

07:10.138 --> 07:12.766
8.33 each, Bubs. I should get the

07:10.138 --> 07:12.766
extra Europe.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.768
We're going to get 8.33 each.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.768
It's only fair.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.519
...even, right. All I fucking know right now

07:16.561 --> 07:18.105
is I'm going to get some hash,

07:18.146 --> 07:19.898
I'm getting high as fuck in this park

07:18.146 --> 07:19.898
for most of the day.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.400
Fuck food, fuck liquor. I need some hash.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.693
Fine. You spend your 8.33 how you want, man.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.693
Okay.

07:23.735 --> 07:26.196
You can't get high in the park.

07:23.735 --> 07:26.196
Why?

07:26.238 --> 07:27.822
It's not legal.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.366
I'm pretty sure you've got to be

07:27.864 --> 07:29.366
inside, don't you?

07:29.408 --> 07:31.618
This is Amsterdam. You can do anything

07:29.408 --> 07:31.618
you want here.

07:31.659 --> 07:32.953
I know you can smoke it, but I don't think

07:32.994 --> 07:34.579
you can just walk around smoking it.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.664
I don't see anybody walking around...

07:36.706 --> 07:37.874
Is that cops there?

07:37.916 --> 07:39.793
What the fuck is... "Politie"?

07:39.834 --> 07:41.586
Bubbles: Yes, it's cops, but we...

07:41.628 --> 07:43.546
I'll find out then what the fuck the deal is.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.966
Don't go asking the cops about hash,

07:43.588 --> 07:45.966
for fuck's sake!

07:46.007 --> 07:48.802
I think it's a smart thing to probably do.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.137
Ricky!

07:50.178 --> 07:51.346
Hey, guys. Uh...

07:51.388 --> 07:54.224
Do you guys speak English?

07:51.388 --> 07:54.224
Anglaishe? Yeah.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.600
Oh, excellent, okay, perfect.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.894
We're from Sunnyvale, Canada, and my friends,

07:57.936 --> 07:59.604
first time here, it's like Disneyland

07:57.936 --> 07:59.604
to them

07:59.646 --> 08:01.606
'cause they both like to smoke a lot of dope.

08:01.648 --> 08:02.816
He likes hash and weed.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.567
Can we get hash and weed around here or...

08:04.609 --> 08:06.153
Yes, you can. Ricky:

08:04.609 --> 08:06.153
Okay, perfect.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.488
Officer: Over there. Smoking.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.488
Coffee shop.

08:08.529 --> 08:10.740
(Chuckling) I love... or they

08:08.529 --> 08:10.740
love this place.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.410
And how much can you carry on your person?

08:13.452 --> 08:14.828
Officer: About five grams.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.704
Five grams? Five grams each.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.704
Five grams each.

08:16.746 --> 08:17.956
So you're going to have to carry five

08:17.998 --> 08:19.333
and you can carry five. No, I'm not...

08:19.374 --> 08:20.541
No jail. Perfect.

08:20.583 --> 08:21.751
All I want is some rum.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.128
Where can I find some cheap rum?

08:23.170 --> 08:24.879
Cheap? It's Amsterdam, still Amsterdam,

08:24.921 --> 08:26.340
so it's expensive.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.757
Expen... like, for a rum and Coke?

08:27.799 --> 08:29.550
Yeah, ten. Ten?

08:27.799 --> 08:29.550
Ten euros.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.386
Ten euros! Are you fucking kidding me?

08:31.428 --> 08:33.180
You don't even have enough for a drink.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.180
No, I'm getting 10 bucks.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.555
How much is hash? What happened to fair?

08:34.597 --> 08:36.141
It's 10 bu... I need a drink!

08:36.183 --> 08:38.685
Okay? For a joint

08:36.183 --> 08:38.685
is five euros.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.270
Five? So hash is cheaper than liquor.

08:40.312 --> 08:42.189
So, let's just go to hash.

08:40.312 --> 08:42.189
You can get...

08:42.230 --> 08:43.731
Don't you want to get some food?

08:43.773 --> 08:45.650
Well, do they have stuff you

08:43.773 --> 08:45.650
can eat, like...?

08:45.692 --> 08:48.403
Yeah, space cake. Space cake?

08:45.692 --> 08:48.403
I like the sound of that.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.904
Let's get some space cake for you, Bubs.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.656
I just want something without the hash in it.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.533
Some French fries or something.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.410
Maybe a hot dog. Or hash fries.

08:55.452 --> 08:56.870
(Chuckling) Hash fries.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.079
Let's go get you guys some hash.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.956
Come on, guys. Thank you.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.416
Cheers. Thank you.

09:01.458 --> 09:04.002
(Conversation in Dutch)

09:06.171 --> 09:07.881
Ricky, why did you fucking tell them

09:07.922 --> 09:09.966
that we smoke hash? Yeah, what's

09:07.922 --> 09:09.966
it called?

09:10.008 --> 09:11.510
You wanted to know what the fucking laws were.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.762
Well, you didn't have to fucking say

09:11.551 --> 09:14.762
it was for us.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.181
I don't want any fucking hash.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.807
They were high. You could tell, anyway.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.352
They smoke hash. Those guys don't

09:17.849 --> 09:20.352
smoke hash.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.938
Julian: So do they sell booze

09:21.978 --> 09:23.938
in these places?

09:23.980 --> 09:26.941
No. Just coffee and fucking awesome dope.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.985
Just coffee and dope? No booze?

09:29.027 --> 09:31.154
Well, let's find a place that sells booze then.

09:31.196 --> 09:32.322
Julian, please.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.865
This is the one fucking place

09:32.364 --> 09:33.865
in the world

09:33.907 --> 09:35.700
where I think dope takes fucking

09:33.907 --> 09:35.700
priority over...

09:35.742 --> 09:37.577
(Clattering) Bubbles:

09:35.742 --> 09:37.577
Ricky!

09:37.618 --> 09:38.995
Jesus Christ.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.248
What the fuck's with all the bikes

09:39.037 --> 09:41.248
around here?

09:41.289 --> 09:43.708
That's how people get around in Amsterdam.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.085
(Sighing)

09:46.836 --> 09:49.047
No fucking booze. Are you kidding me?

09:49.923 --> 09:51.425
There it is, boys.

09:51.466 --> 09:52.633
I've heard about this place.

09:52.675 --> 09:53.885
It's fucking famous.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.012
Ricky, are you crying?

09:53.927 --> 09:56.012
Crying? No.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.347
You know, a lot of kids,

09:57.389 --> 09:59.849
they dream of going to Disneylandworld;

09:59.891 --> 10:02.602
this has been my dream my whole fucking life.

10:02.643 --> 10:04.271
Now I'm here. (Chuckling)

10:04.312 --> 10:05.688
Julian: Let's just

10:04.312 --> 10:05.688
get in here

10:05.730 --> 10:06.856
and get some fucking weed,

10:06.898 --> 10:08.066
get high and get the fuck out

10:08.108 --> 10:09.650
and find a bar, please.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.027
We need food, boys.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.405
Oh, my God! There's kitties in here?

10:13.447 --> 10:15.615
Kitty's getting high in here too.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.242
Kitties!

10:17.284 --> 10:18.618
Hi there.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.454
What's your name? (Meowing)

10:20.495 --> 10:21.621
(Chuckling)

10:21.662 --> 10:23.164
He's a nice little kitty.

10:23.206 --> 10:27.252
(Indistinct) ...Super Silver Haze,

10:27.294 --> 10:30.255
King Kush, Methane Cheese,

10:27.294 --> 10:30.255
Amnesia Supreme...

10:30.297 --> 10:31.714
Look at the hashish!

10:32.673 --> 10:34.842
Just... just pick one.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.842
Hi.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.344
How are you doing? Ricky:

10:34.884 --> 10:36.344
I'm good.

10:36.386 --> 10:37.971
I'm Ricky, from Sunnyvale, Canada.

10:36.386 --> 10:37.971
I'm Ron.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.180
I'm Ron. Nice to meet you.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.180
This is Julian.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.599
And this is Bubbles. Hi.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.599
Ron.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.933
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.310
How are you guys doing?

10:41.975 --> 10:43.310
So... this is real?

10:43.351 --> 10:45.479
Long way from home? Yeah. Ha, ha!

10:45.520 --> 10:46.896
This is real, yeah, definitely.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.856
Ricky: There are so many

10:46.938 --> 10:48.856
wonderful things on here.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.567
And you guys have edibles? Like...

10:50.609 --> 10:51.776
Ron: Yeah, we have

10:50.609 --> 10:51.776
edibles as well.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.236
We have cakes and muffins.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.196
We sell that at the other bar.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.196
Seriously, boys...

10:55.238 --> 10:56.990
Ron: And on this list you can see that

10:55.238 --> 10:56.990
the weed list

10:57.031 --> 11:00.243
which communicates the sativa or

10:57.031 --> 11:00.243
indica behind it.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.244
This is the hash list,

11:01.286 --> 11:02.954
the countries where it's from,

11:02.996 --> 11:05.540
pre-rolled joints... Oh, God...

11:05.582 --> 11:08.627
Calm down, Ricky. Yeah, pick

11:05.582 --> 11:08.627
something. Okay.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.420
I haven't been high since Copenhagen, Danishmart.

11:10.462 --> 11:11.921
So to me it was like being a little kid

11:11.963 --> 11:13.173
and looking at the Shears catalogue

11:13.214 --> 11:14.673
and trying to pick out a fucking toy.

11:14.715 --> 11:16.301
There was just so much to pick from.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.094
I think we should spend it all, boys,

11:16.343 --> 11:18.094
and we'll get to...

11:18.136 --> 11:19.929
No, we're not... No! We're not

11:18.136 --> 11:19.929
spending it all.

11:19.971 --> 11:21.640
I'm hungry too, and we'll get you

11:19.971 --> 11:21.640
a drink after,

11:21.680 --> 11:22.974
but... Yeah, when?

11:23.016 --> 11:24.767
Ricky, I'm saving my money for food.

11:24.809 --> 11:25.977
Okay, how much money do I have?

11:26.019 --> 11:28.313
You've got 8 euros 33.

11:28.355 --> 11:32.192
Okay. I've got 9 euros to spend.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.692
No... I'm going to start

11:32.233 --> 11:33.692
with some hash

11:33.734 --> 11:36.446
8.33, Ricky. and I'd like

11:33.734 --> 11:36.446
some of the...

11:36.488 --> 11:38.281
How does his brain work?

11:36.488 --> 11:38.281
the Afghan.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.991
I think I'll try some of the Afghan

11:40.033 --> 11:41.409
and the... Ron:

11:40.033 --> 11:41.409
Yes, the Baby & Buddha.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.701
and the Nepalese Cream.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.329
Ron: And the Nepalese

11:42.743 --> 11:44.329
Cream. Oh my God.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.873
Half-half? Ricky:

11:44.371 --> 11:46.873
Half, yeah, out of the nine.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.416
And look at this.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.793
Rolling papers, filters.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.128
(Laughing) Right on the bar.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.214
I love this place! (Annoyed sigh)

11:54.255 --> 11:55.590
Boys, I should move here.

11:55.632 --> 11:56.799
I should've been bornt here.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.218
You can't move here, Ricky.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.844
If you move here, I've got to move here.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.596
Ron: This is your

11:59.886 --> 12:01.596
Baby & Buddha.

12:01.638 --> 12:02.972
God...

12:05.724 --> 12:08.228
It's not very big. I wish we had more money.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.480
Ohh, God, that smells good.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.026
That's great.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.487
Just like home, boys, but it's totally legal.

12:18.613 --> 12:21.575
(Deeply inhaling)

12:21.616 --> 12:23.410
Mmm.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.786
They'd make a lot more money if they

12:23.451 --> 12:25.786
sold booze here.

12:25.828 --> 12:26.996
You guys would make a lot more money

12:27.038 --> 12:28.248
if you sold booze here, you know?

12:28.289 --> 12:30.124
You know that, right? Ron:

12:28.289 --> 12:30.124
I know, sir.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.711
And it used to be like that up until 2007.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.421
We had a full-size bar.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.214
Unfortunately the Dutch government

12:36.256 --> 12:38.007
is changing laws now and then.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.051
Julian: Fuck.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.051
So you have to choose.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.345
Either the smoke or the booze.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.763
I would have chosen booze.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.763
So we can just sit and smoke?

12:44.805 --> 12:46.099
After you pay me you can.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.935
It's 9 euros. Pay the man, Julian.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.354
64 cents is coming out of yours, Bubs.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.565
What do you mean, "coming out of mine"?

12:51.396 --> 12:53.565
66 cents, actually.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.108
Can't come out of mine!

12:53.607 --> 12:55.108
I'll pay you back!

12:55.149 --> 12:56.443
I'll pay you back the 33 fucking cents.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.445
How did I get fucked?

12:56.484 --> 12:58.445
He owes you...

12:58.486 --> 13:00.447
Ron: And one, your change, sir.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.447
Thank you.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.365
Have a pleasant smoke and enjoy Amsterdam.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.618
I'm going to have close to a thousand dollars later.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.869
I'm going to be back. I want a little bit

13:04.659 --> 13:06.869
of everything.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.080
Ron: See you a bit later.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.080
Thank you.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.290
You won't have a thousand.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.833
You'll have 999 and 33 cents.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.502
36 cents.

13:14.544 --> 13:18.381
Drumroll, please! (Imitating drumroll,

13:14.544 --> 13:18.381
cymbal crash)

13:23.802 --> 13:27.348
(Slow exhalation)

13:27.390 --> 13:29.309
Finally.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.436
Now it's a fucking vacation, boys.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.689
Thanks. How is it?

13:31.478 --> 13:34.689
Nepalese Cream.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.316
De-licious.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.609
The taste of that hash reminded me

13:37.651 --> 13:39.486
of the hash we used to get back in Grade 6.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.780
The kind of hash that, no matter how fucking

13:39.527 --> 13:41.780
stressed out you are,

13:41.820 --> 13:43.990
you take one big lungful and everything is fucking better.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.408
Fuck, I love unfucked-with hash!

13:47.034 --> 13:49.162
Nepalese Cream, eh?

13:49.203 --> 13:51.122
Are you going to give me some food?

13:51.164 --> 13:53.124
I paid for 33 cents of that.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.169
That's got to be a drag.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.505
Just smoke some. Just a bloody drag.

13:58.546 --> 14:01.299
Enjoy, buddy. (Panting)

14:01.341 --> 14:03.176
Have you got a buzz-on yet or what?

14:03.217 --> 14:04.552
Instantly. I love this pl...

14:04.594 --> 14:06.179
Look at this.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.723
Everyone sitting around, smoking,

14:06.220 --> 14:08.723
having a good time.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.016
You see, if they had liquor here,

14:10.057 --> 14:11.934
there'd probably be fighting...

14:11.976 --> 14:13.227
This is fucking awesome.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.521
People wouldn't be fighting, man, come on.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.896
I might be, if I was really wasted right now.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.565
There's some dicks, yeah,

14:17.607 --> 14:19.108
but there's dicks that get stoned

14:17.607 --> 14:19.108
too, you know.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.527
They park their fucking bikes

14:20.568 --> 14:22.487
in the middle of the goddamn

14:20.568 --> 14:22.487
sidewalks and shit.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.864
Yeah, I probably would be getting in a fight

14:22.529 --> 14:24.864
if I was drunk right now.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.908
This is making me nice and calm and happy.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.288
Can we go and get some food?

14:32.330 --> 14:34.207
No, we've got to go get a drink first.

14:34.248 --> 14:37.460
Let's just enjoy the moment here, guys.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.295
It's not all about you, you know, Bubs.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.880
I never said it's all about me,

14:40.921 --> 14:42.882
but I haven't fucking eaten in almost two days!

14:42.923 --> 14:44.133
Stop talking about food,

14:42.923 --> 14:44.133
'cause now

14:44.175 --> 14:46.386
this is making me extra fucking hungry.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.513
Just 'cause I want to eat something

14:48.555 --> 14:50.223
in two fucking days... I know, okay!

14:48.555 --> 14:50.223
Well, I...

14:50.264 --> 14:53.434
I've been taking about this since

14:50.264 --> 14:53.434
I got here, okay?

14:53.476 --> 14:56.270
When you've been drinking liquor since

14:53.476 --> 14:56.270
the age of 6 or 7,

14:56.312 --> 14:58.439
one thing you need every day is liquor.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.066
Why can't I get a fucking drink

15:00.107 --> 15:01.984
on the way to get food, for fuck's sakes?

15:02.026 --> 15:03.403
Despite what Julian and Mr. Lahey

15:03.444 --> 15:04.987
might try to make you believe,

15:05.029 --> 15:07.198
the human body can't live off of just liquor.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.409
It needs to have food.

15:09.450 --> 15:10.577
Foodstuffs!

15:13.246 --> 15:15.164
That's about...

15:15.206 --> 15:16.957
That's close.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.502
Smooth as a baby's hand.

15:19.544 --> 15:30.304
( ♪♪ )

15:30.346 --> 15:32.432
Boys, that's nuclear hash.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.768
Ricky: What were we

15:32.473 --> 15:34.768
talking about?

15:34.809 --> 15:36.770
I don't know.

15:36.811 --> 15:39.606
I might actually have to put this little

15:36.811 --> 15:39.606
camper out for a bit.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.065
Good idea, man.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.275
Go to bed, little buddy.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.526
I'll wake you up in a little bit.

15:43.568 --> 15:46.112
All right, let's go get a drink.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.447
Holy fuck, boys, am I ever hungry.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.198
we got to get some more money.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.868
How much money do you have left?

15:51.910 --> 15:53.202
Well, I don't know now.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.871
Yeah, you don't spend much money on food

15:54.913 --> 15:57.415
and you don't spend it at all on liquor...

15:54.913 --> 15:57.415
You spent my 33...

15:57.457 --> 15:59.292
I've got 8 euros. (Heavy sigh)

15:59.333 --> 16:02.002
We'll see how much this costs.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.002
My stomach's making tiger noises.

16:02.044 --> 16:05.256
Can you hear it? I hear something.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.258
No, you're high, Bubs.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.471
You can't even hear his stomach...

16:08.760 --> 16:11.471
And now I can legally...

16:11.512 --> 16:14.682
leave this place with hash in

16:11.512 --> 16:14.682
my pocket.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.392
We even asked the cops.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.311
Julian: Right on, boys, this is

16:16.434 --> 16:18.311
what I'm talking about.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.187
Thank fuck! Bubs, why don't you just

16:20.229 --> 16:21.856
get some food in here, man? Yeah, Bubs!

16:21.898 --> 16:24.150
No, I'm waiting. I'm waiting.

16:24.191 --> 16:25.985
You're not going to get the most food in a pub.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.153
Hurry up and get a drink.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.362
I'm going to be out here.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.364
I've only got 8 euros 33

16:30.406 --> 16:32.867
and that's not where you're going

16:30.406 --> 16:32.867
to get the most food.

16:32.909 --> 16:35.411
(Nervous chuckle) You ever feel like

16:32.909 --> 16:35.411
you're a snowman

16:35.453 --> 16:37.288
and you wonder if you're going

16:35.453 --> 16:37.288
to melt or not?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.165
(Laughing) Ricky, you're baked.

16:39.206 --> 16:40.625
I am too... I'm fucked!

16:40.667 --> 16:42.001
We should smoke another joint

16:42.042 --> 16:43.336
and level off a little bit.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.839
That doesn't make any sense.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.839
(Laughing)

16:45.880 --> 16:47.006
Smoking another joint's

16:47.047 --> 16:48.382
just going to make you higher.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.844
I wish I was made of sand.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.219
(Giggling)

16:52.261 --> 16:54.096
Stop saying things like that, Ricky,

16:54.138 --> 16:56.056
'cause now I feel like I'm made of sand.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.433
Imagine if we were a duck

16:57.475 --> 16:58.977
and we just go in the canal right now

16:59.018 --> 17:00.728
and swoop in and start...

17:00.770 --> 17:03.189
fffloating our way around.

17:00.770 --> 17:03.189
Here, Bubs.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.232
Oh, you happy now, Mr. Crankypants?

17:05.274 --> 17:08.152
Yeah, well, kinda. Good.

17:05.274 --> 17:08.152
Here.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.530
Where's the rest of it?

17:08.194 --> 17:10.530
That's it, man.

17:10.571 --> 17:13.407
How much is there? 6 euros!

17:13.449 --> 17:15.368
I'm supposed to have 8 euro 33.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.370
But... I know, but it cost 10 euros

17:15.409 --> 17:17.370
for this drink.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.746
Oh, that's fair! Way to go, Julian!

17:18.788 --> 17:20.874
I could have spent another dollar on hash!

17:20.915 --> 17:23.209
So why do you get to spend 10

17:20.915 --> 17:23.209
dollars on liquor...

17:23.250 --> 17:24.919
What am I going to do, negotiate

17:23.250 --> 17:24.919
a price with her?

17:24.961 --> 17:26.963
It's 10 euros. Why didn't you

17:24.961 --> 17:26.963
order a single?

17:27.005 --> 17:29.173
Come on! Just remember, when

17:27.005 --> 17:29.173
he's starving to death

17:29.215 --> 17:30.967
and we're all starving to death, it's your fault.

17:31.009 --> 17:32.385
Well... hey, no, no, no, no, no!

17:32.426 --> 17:33.553
Don't blame this all on me.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.221
You've ripped him off too.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.556
I didn't rip him off.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.556
You did so rip him off.

17:36.597 --> 17:37.974
You guys both fucking ripped me off.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.393
You smoked what I owed you in the joint.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.978
I took one drag, Ricky!

17:42.020 --> 17:43.604
And I paid for 33 cents' worth.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.023
Julian: Well, here, do

17:43.646 --> 17:45.023
you want a drink?

17:45.105 --> 17:46.399
Yes, I want a fucking drink.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.775
I'm taking a drink too.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.402
I own 4% of that drink.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.612
No, no, no, no, Bubs! Are you kidding me?

17:51.654 --> 17:53.531
I didn't say fucking gulp it!

17:53.573 --> 17:55.742
Just a little... No! No, no that's it, that's it!

17:55.783 --> 17:58.327
That's it, he took too much.

17:58.369 --> 17:59.662
That's what you get. Jesus Christ.

17:59.704 --> 18:03.207
He's a sassy one. I paid for that gulp.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.001
Julian: Okay, and you

18:03.249 --> 18:05.001
got the gulp.

18:05.043 --> 18:07.420
Yeah, one fucking gulp.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.964
And who decides what a gulp is anyway?

18:10.006 --> 18:12.717
Ricky: Your girlfriend's hot.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.717
Ricky!

18:12.759 --> 18:14.343
What? She is!

18:14.385 --> 18:17.764
Yes, she is pretty fucking hot, man.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.016
Boys, I'm fucking baked out of my mind.

18:20.058 --> 18:21.392
I know, it's awesome!

18:21.434 --> 18:22.685
Okay, let's go get some food.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.228
Well, why don't we just go to a bar, man,

18:24.270 --> 18:25.980
and sit down, for fuck's sakes?

18:26.022 --> 18:28.441
We were just at a fucking bar. Why didn't you

18:26.022 --> 18:28.441
eat at the bar?

18:28.482 --> 18:30.526
Because it's not good bang for the buck, boys.

18:30.568 --> 18:33.279
We've got 6 euros, you know,

18:33.320 --> 18:35.281
so I need bang for the buck.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.199
We need to find, like, a...

18:37.241 --> 18:38.785
like, a French fry place

18:38.826 --> 18:41.662
or a... kee-babs... Ohh, you're

18:38.826 --> 18:41.662
making me hungry.

18:41.704 --> 18:44.123
get myself a doner kee-babs.

18:41.704 --> 18:44.123
I'm fucking starving, Bubbles!

18:44.164 --> 18:46.793
Stop talking about food. Yeah, man, stop

18:44.164 --> 18:46.793
talking about food.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.128
Well, that's all... Boys, my feet are

18:46.834 --> 18:49.128
fucking killing me.

18:49.169 --> 18:50.713
I've got to sit down.

18:50.755 --> 18:53.841
Well, we'll be fine... I fucking love

18:50.755 --> 18:53.841
this place.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.638
Cannabis College?

18:58.679 --> 19:00.765
What the fuck is that? Is that real?

19:02.516 --> 19:03.726
All right, Bubs, just give me a minute.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.436
I've got to check this fucking place out.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.146
Maybe I'll go to school here.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.146
Maybe I could teach.

19:07.187 --> 19:10.149
For fuck's sakes! Ricky, I'm fucking

19:07.187 --> 19:10.149
starving.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.484
We're Cannabis College... Thank you.

19:11.525 --> 19:15.279
information centre about cannabis.

19:11.525 --> 19:15.279
Welcome in.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.239
Ricky: This is awesome.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.200
Okay, let me get this straight.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.161
This is an actual college for cannabis?

19:22.202 --> 19:23.704
Well, we're a free information centre.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.289
If there's anything you'd like to learn,

19:25.331 --> 19:27.000
you're welcome to just ask.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.000
This is wicked.

19:27.041 --> 19:29.293
Like, I could come over here and maybe work here.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.837
Do you guys take job applications?

19:30.878 --> 19:33.380
Um, well, what we do is we take volunteers.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.174
If you want to, you can help out

19:33.422 --> 19:35.174
by volunteering.

19:35.215 --> 19:37.217
That's a job application?

19:35.215 --> 19:37.217
Yes, it's a volunteer application.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.428
So you guys are doing all this and making

19:37.259 --> 19:39.428
a great living?

19:39.470 --> 19:41.388
This is wicked! No, Ricky,

19:41.430 --> 19:42.640
volunteer.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.100
They mean you work for free. That's...

19:44.142 --> 19:46.477
But, if you take applications,

19:44.142 --> 19:46.477
you get a job here.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.104
Do you want an application?

19:46.519 --> 19:48.104
Definitely.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.396
Do you hire Canadians?

19:49.438 --> 19:51.231
Um, so long as you're legal to live here.

19:51.273 --> 19:54.234
Well, if you don't leave, then it's

19:51.273 --> 19:54.234
legal, I guess.

19:54.276 --> 19:57.488
Ricky, you know this is... Boys, I could be working

19:54.276 --> 19:57.488
at a cannabis college!

19:57.530 --> 19:59.323
Legit. Volunteering at a

19:57.530 --> 19:59.323
cannabis college.

19:59.365 --> 20:03.036
It's volunteering, Rick. Making money

19:59.365 --> 20:03.036
doing what I love.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.996
He doesn't know what a fucking volunteer is.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.373
He doesn't know what it fucking means.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.373
Doesn't have a clue.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.042
"Ricky The Fucking Professor".

20:09.083 --> 20:11.002
It's got a nice rang to it,

20:09.083 --> 20:11.002
doesn't it, boys?

20:11.044 --> 20:13.462
Ricky... I'll move my whole

20:11.044 --> 20:13.462
fucking family over here,

20:13.504 --> 20:14.881
make a good living. But, Ricky,

20:14.922 --> 20:16.465
that's the part you're not getting!

20:16.507 --> 20:18.051
You're not going to be making a living!

20:18.092 --> 20:20.386
What are you talking about, Bubs? Teachers

20:18.092 --> 20:20.386
get fucking paid!

20:20.427 --> 20:22.596
It's good job. No, you'd be volunteering!

20:22.638 --> 20:24.473
Just... You know what, Julian?

20:22.638 --> 20:24.473
Just forget it.

20:24.515 --> 20:26.100
He's never going to understand.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.685
Let's just go fucking eat, please!

20:27.727 --> 20:30.021
Right now? Yes, right now!

20:30.063 --> 20:32.857
I'm starving! Let's see some sights,

20:30.063 --> 20:32.857
or do something!

20:32.899 --> 20:34.901
Ricky, you've got your stuff,

20:32.899 --> 20:34.901
he's got his liquor.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.611
I need to eat. I don't give a fuck

20:34.942 --> 20:37.611
what anybody says,

20:37.653 --> 20:39.030
we're eating right now!

20:39.072 --> 20:40.406
Oh, my fuck!

20:40.447 --> 20:42.491
Are you serious?

20:42.533 --> 20:44.243
Dudes! What's up?

20:44.284 --> 20:45.452
What are you doing here?

20:45.494 --> 20:47.038
What the fuck are you doing here?

20:47.080 --> 20:49.082
This is my boat, bro!

20:49.123 --> 20:50.583
Get the fuck on the boat

20:50.624 --> 20:53.920
'cause we got some getting-fucked-up to do!

20:53.961 --> 21:08.935
( ♪♪ )

22:25.719 --> 22:28.388
(Seabirds squawking)

22:40.651 --> 22:44.989
Fish: Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

22:45.031 --> 22:48.701
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

22:51.411 --> 22:52.705
(Whisper) Fuck.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.874
(Light clicks off) Fuck off.
