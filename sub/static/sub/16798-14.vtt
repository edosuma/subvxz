WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:02.003
The South
American nation of Colombia

00:02.004 --> 00:04.414
has been engaged in a
devastating domestic conflict

00:04.415 --> 00:05.949
for more than five decades,

00:05.950 --> 00:08.985
which has claimed hundreds
of thousands of lives.

00:08.986 --> 00:10.520
On one side, the conservative,

00:10.521 --> 00:11.904
democratically elected government.

00:11.905 --> 00:15.192
On the other, a powerful
far-left rebel group.

00:15.193 --> 00:17.294
But today, an historic
truce is on hand,

00:17.295 --> 00:19.896
and for that we can thank
these two millennials,

00:19.897 --> 00:22.032
Juan-Luis Moreno and Soledad Penagos,

00:22.033 --> 00:24.601
otherwise known as the
"Romeo and Juliet of Colombia."

00:24.602 --> 00:26.603
Hey, can I get a hand over here?

00:26.604 --> 00:28.371
Romeo and Juliet are gonna be in town

00:28.372 --> 00:30.075
for three days
celebrating this peace deal.

00:30.076 --> 00:32.375
- You're gonna see a lot more of that.
- Can't wait.

00:32.375 --> 00:35.278
Well, I for one think they're adorable.

00:35.279 --> 00:37.147
You shouldn't be so jaded about love.

00:37.148 --> 00:38.882
It's gonna happen to you one day.

00:38.883 --> 00:39.850
Want to bet?

00:39.851 --> 00:41.117
It's so bogus.

00:41.118 --> 00:43.086
Anyway, it's a
manufactured relationship.

00:43.087 --> 00:45.355
A complete and total media creation.

00:45.356 --> 00:46.323
Thank you, Noam Chomsky.

00:46.324 --> 00:47.958
Now, you want to give me a hand?

00:47.959 --> 00:49.560
The son of the president
and the daughter

00:49.561 --> 00:51.264
of the resistance
leader just fall in love,

00:51.265 --> 00:52.562
and a peace treaty is born?

00:52.563 --> 00:54.264
And you guys are just lapping this up.

00:54.265 --> 00:57.467
It's about passing the
mantle to the millennials

00:57.468 --> 00:59.569
- on a global scale.
- The main point is

00:59.570 --> 01:01.905
that when this peace treaty
is signed in a month,

01:01.906 --> 01:02.939
Colombia will end

01:02.940 --> 01:04.541
a half a century of conflict.

01:04.542 --> 01:05.642
And then?

01:05.643 --> 01:07.143
Juan-Luis and Soledad's wedding.

01:07.144 --> 01:08.311
I rest my case.

01:08.312 --> 01:11.281
Yes... No, what I was
actually talking about

01:11.282 --> 01:13.550
is the aid package
that State has put together

01:13.551 --> 01:14.851
for all of South America.

01:14.852 --> 01:17.320
We're signing an MOU

01:17.321 --> 01:20.257
with Venezuela this week.

01:20.258 --> 01:23.093
I know I've talked about this before.

01:23.094 --> 01:24.494
An MOU...

01:24.495 --> 01:26.478
It's a Memorandum
of Understanding, right?

01:26.479 --> 01:30.066
It's, like, the document that lays out

01:30.067 --> 01:31.501
our strategic objectives

01:31.502 --> 01:33.536
with Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador.

01:33.537 --> 01:35.639
Yes! Thank you!

01:35.640 --> 01:37.223
It was not easy getting these countries

01:37.224 --> 01:39.276
to agree on anything,
so it is nice to know

01:39.277 --> 01:41.578
that one of my kids listens to me.

01:41.579 --> 01:44.414
Actually, I was listening
to Russell Jackson.

01:44.415 --> 01:45.582
Ooh...

01:45.583 --> 01:49.319
Okay, yesterday, he made me.

01:49.320 --> 01:52.188
Soledad Penagos's White House liaison.

01:52.189 --> 01:54.224
- That is so exciting!
- Hey!

01:54.225 --> 01:56.106
So I've been up all night,

01:56.107 --> 01:57.450
and I'm learning everything I can

01:57.451 --> 01:59.905
about the peace deal
and the... trade agreements.

01:59.906 --> 02:02.318
Is that work? Because if it is,

02:02.319 --> 02:03.498
you said you would give me a ride.

02:03.499 --> 02:06.000
You cannot bail! Because I don't have a car today.
- I can, I can.

02:06.001 --> 02:08.008
I can if you hurry and we go right now.
Okay. All right.

02:08.008 --> 02:09.722
- I'm done. I'm done.
- The Venezuelan foreign minister

02:09.723 --> 02:10.826
is on his way to my office,

02:10.827 --> 02:12.237
and he used the word "urgent."

02:12.238 --> 02:13.421
Problem with the aid package?

02:13.422 --> 02:16.141
Unless he has an urgent
muffin basket for me.

02:16.142 --> 02:17.675
<i>Okay.</i>

02:17.676 --> 02:20.512
But the apartment's as
much yours as it is Abby's.

02:20.513 --> 02:22.347
She can't keep you locked out forever.

02:22.348 --> 02:24.582
I'm not locked out. I...

02:24.583 --> 02:26.050
I agreed to give her space.

02:26.051 --> 02:28.186
Four weeks is a lot of space.

02:28.187 --> 02:29.320
All part of the process.

02:29.321 --> 02:31.489
But, yeah, it feels like an eternity.

02:31.490 --> 02:33.425
But we have another
therapy session this morning,

02:33.426 --> 02:35.693
so I'm gonna propose...
Hey, roomie. Scott.

02:35.694 --> 02:37.462
A timeline for me to come home.

02:37.463 --> 02:39.964
Hey, how about the three of us
grab drinks tomorrow night?

02:39.965 --> 02:41.733
That new bar on 18th?

02:41.734 --> 02:43.717
Maybe we'll even have
something to celebrate?

02:43.718 --> 02:44.702
All right, man.

02:44.703 --> 02:46.304
Can we just start drinking now?

02:49.808 --> 02:51.976
Minister Rojas,
when we spoke yesterday,

02:51.977 --> 02:54.479
you assured me that Venezuela

02:54.480 --> 02:56.981
was on board with the aid package.

02:56.982 --> 03:00.083
And today, President Alvarado
is having second thoughts.

03:01.453 --> 03:04.522
Your country is still
recovering from the earthquake

03:04.523 --> 03:05.890
that killed his predecessor.

03:05.891 --> 03:06.991
Why on earth

03:06.992 --> 03:09.294
would he refuse international aid?

03:09.295 --> 03:10.662
In his inauguration speech,

03:10.663 --> 03:12.664
Alvarado promised
to continue the legacy

03:12.665 --> 03:14.032
of the late President Suarez.

03:14.033 --> 03:16.067
Which means he can't appear to be

03:16.068 --> 03:17.969
too friendly with the U.S.

03:17.970 --> 03:19.404
Seriously?

03:19.405 --> 03:22.173
There's also the issue of tying
us financially to Colombia.

03:22.174 --> 03:23.842
For the good of everyone involved.

03:23.843 --> 03:25.910
- You want coffee?
- No, thank you.

03:25.911 --> 03:29.747
We'll be able to replace
illegal coca fields

03:29.748 --> 03:33.818
with high-value exports,
like aa­ and quinoa.

03:33.819 --> 03:35.320
It will help grow

03:35.321 --> 03:36.688
the entire region economically,

03:36.689 --> 03:41.860
and it will significantly reduce
drugs and crime in the U.S.

03:41.861 --> 03:43.895
And it is a great contribution

03:43.896 --> 03:45.263
to the world at large.

03:45.264 --> 03:47.799
How could your president
not want to be a part of that?

03:47.800 --> 03:50.502
It is only a pipe dream if the
peace agreement doesn't hold.

03:50.503 --> 03:52.704
Back home, there are rumors
that it is on shaky ground,

03:52.705 --> 03:54.906
that the Colombian congress
is wavering.

03:54.907 --> 03:58.343
President Moreno and
ECS leader Mateo Penagos

03:58.344 --> 04:00.044
do not get along.

04:00.045 --> 04:02.080
They've been at war for 50 years.

04:02.081 --> 04:04.148
It is totally unrealistic
for anyone to think

04:04.149 --> 04:06.451
that they should suddenly
become drinking buddies.

04:06.452 --> 04:09.687
Can we just settle for peace first,

04:09.688 --> 04:13.458
and then worry about friendship?

04:13.459 --> 04:16.661
In the meantime, they have promised

04:16.661 --> 04:19.029
that they will keep
their congress in line.

04:25.571 --> 04:27.738
One second.

04:28.687 --> 04:30.456
- Sorry to interrupt, ma'am.
- Yeah.

04:30.457 --> 04:32.091
Russell Jackson has requested that you

04:32.092 --> 04:34.927
visit the Oval Office on the
way to the press conference.

04:34.928 --> 04:37.351
Aren't he and Dalton meeting
with the Colombian delegation...

04:37.352 --> 04:39.686
- He said it was urgent.
- Right now?

04:44.937 --> 04:46.205
- Hey.
- How's it going?

04:46.206 --> 04:48.539
So this is finally happening.

04:49.775 --> 04:51.343
Dr. McCord.

04:51.344 --> 04:52.643
Ian.

04:53.412 --> 04:54.847
How you feeling?

04:54.848 --> 04:57.282
Like I'm about to jump into
the deep end of the crazy pool.

04:57.283 --> 04:58.384
You go ahead and joke all you want.

04:58.385 --> 04:59.651
Just make sure you got it locked down

04:59.652 --> 05:01.013
when you meet these guys tomorrow.

05:01.014 --> 05:02.414
Look, I know you've been
undercover on criminal ops,

05:02.415 --> 05:04.790
but you've never dealt
with religious radicals.

05:04.791 --> 05:07.760
These guys are hard-core, I get it.

05:07.761 --> 05:10.095
When I went down
to the Covenant of John

05:10.096 --> 05:12.998
in Bolivia, 37 people died by suicide.

05:12.999 --> 05:14.400
I couldn't stop it.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.502
And this new hybrid group
is even more dangerous.

05:16.503 --> 05:18.137
They've twisted the Bible

05:18.138 --> 05:19.338
to justify violence,

05:19.339 --> 05:22.241
and they literally believe
God is on their side.

05:22.242 --> 05:24.610
They're not just hard-core.

05:24.611 --> 05:26.678
If they sense the slightest threat,

05:26.679 --> 05:28.280
they won't hesitate to kill you.

05:28.281 --> 05:31.216
The only thing they're
gonna sense from me

05:31.217 --> 05:34.119
is a deep devotion to their cause.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.554
Okay.

05:35.555 --> 05:36.855
Here's your gear.

05:36.856 --> 05:39.758
Here are your documents
and your I.D. for your cover.

05:39.759 --> 05:41.126
Major Ryan Gallagher.

05:41.127 --> 05:43.529
There's a GPS sewn into the lining.

05:43.530 --> 05:45.297
Once you arrive,

05:45.298 --> 05:47.166
we'll pinpoint the location.

05:47.167 --> 05:49.567
What if I need to report back?

05:53.472 --> 05:55.207
Should I know what that is?

05:55.208 --> 05:56.275
It's a camera.

05:56.276 --> 05:59.144
This will transmit
wirelessly back to HQ.

05:59.145 --> 06:01.180
Won't they check my stuff for that?

06:01.181 --> 06:02.748
Yeah, but...

06:02.749 --> 06:04.716
this will be embedded in your skin.

06:04.717 --> 06:06.484
It's new tech.

06:07.553 --> 06:10.889
The Bureau will apply
a semi-permanent tattoo

06:10.890 --> 06:13.725
on your neck to match
the ones on your arms.

06:13.726 --> 06:15.494
Wow. I heard about this technology.

06:15.495 --> 06:17.396
I didn't know it was operational.

06:17.397 --> 06:18.897
How reliable is it?

06:18.898 --> 06:20.332
The Bureau's been using it before,

06:20.333 --> 06:22.434
and they approved it for this op, so...

06:22.435 --> 06:25.237
Cool. I'm down with being
a science experiment.

06:25.238 --> 06:27.539
Just get in, find the bomb.

06:27.540 --> 06:30.608
FBI will send in a team
to raid the compound.

06:31.851 --> 06:33.136
<i>What took you so long?</i>

06:33.137 --> 06:36.439
I don't know. Laws of physics?

06:36.440 --> 06:37.478
What's going on?

06:37.479 --> 06:40.014
Colombia's president,
Natalia Moreno, is in there

06:40.015 --> 06:42.183
with the rebel leader, Mateo Penagos,

06:42.184 --> 06:44.252
and the two lovebirds.

06:44.253 --> 06:45.587
Wild guess...

06:45.588 --> 06:48.856
President Moreno and Seor
Penagos aren't getting along.

06:48.857 --> 06:50.491
Yeah. How'd you know?

06:50.492 --> 06:52.560
A little Venezuelan bird told me.

06:52.561 --> 06:54.242
This meeting was scheduled
to last an hour.

06:54.243 --> 06:56.226
The president and I are
running out of small talk.

06:57.967 --> 06:58.933
Elizabeth.

06:58.934 --> 07:01.369
- So glad you could stop by.
- Hi!

07:01.370 --> 07:02.651
President Moreno, Senor Penagos,

07:02.652 --> 07:04.715
- this is Elizabeth McCord...
- So nice to meet you.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.301
Our Secretary of State.

07:07.308 --> 07:10.078
Well, it is an honor to be hosting

07:10.079 --> 07:11.446
your families this week.

07:11.447 --> 07:13.414
We are so happy to be here.

07:13.415 --> 07:14.849
The honor is ours.

07:14.850 --> 07:17.719
Um, allow me to introduce
my daughter, Soledad.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.153
- An honor.
- Pleasure.

07:19.154 --> 07:20.121
And my son, Juan-Luis.

07:20.122 --> 07:22.690
- Hello.
- Welcome.

07:22.691 --> 07:25.760
This truce is such an
amazing accomplishment.

07:25.761 --> 07:27.262
You must be very proud.

07:27.263 --> 07:28.663
Yes. Thank you.

07:28.664 --> 07:30.832
It has been our dream since we met.

07:30.833 --> 07:32.900
My daughter's being modest.

07:32.901 --> 07:36.204
She's a brilliant,
strong-willed young woman.

07:36.205 --> 07:38.506
She would not allow us to
leave the negotiating table

07:38.507 --> 07:39.540
until peace was declared.

07:40.509 --> 07:41.692
But it was Juan-Luis

07:41.693 --> 07:43.911
who structured the agreement.

07:43.912 --> 07:46.714
He demanded the rebels
give up their arms.

07:46.715 --> 07:48.636
In exchange for
a voice in our government,

07:48.637 --> 07:50.105
because a better life for our people

07:50.106 --> 07:52.153
begins with stronger social programs.

07:52.154 --> 07:54.022
A better life for our people begins

07:54.023 --> 07:56.457
when guerilla fighters are no
longer invading their homes.

07:59.527 --> 08:01.128
Hey!

08:01.996 --> 08:04.666
How's it going with the wedding plans?

08:04.667 --> 08:07.468
Have you decided on a color scheme yet?

08:07.469 --> 08:09.170
Yes. Yellow, blue and red.

08:09.171 --> 08:10.605
Like the colors

08:10.606 --> 08:12.307
of the Colombian flag.

08:12.308 --> 08:13.975
And the ECS flag.

08:13.976 --> 08:15.810
Which is really just the Colombian flag

08:15.811 --> 08:17.812
with "ECS" written on it.

08:17.813 --> 08:20.014
My daughter is also engaged.

08:20.015 --> 08:22.684
Stevie. I'm not sure
if you've met her yet.

08:22.685 --> 08:23.918
She works for Russell.

08:23.919 --> 08:25.520
Yes, yes, she was saying

08:25.521 --> 08:27.422
she wanted to finish law school first.

08:27.423 --> 08:29.824
- Maybe Harvard law.
- So impressive.

08:29.825 --> 08:31.092
Yeah.

08:31.093 --> 08:34.562
I have to admit that I have been

08:34.563 --> 08:37.664
peeking at dresses and venues online.

08:37.666 --> 08:40.467
I-I don't want to
interfere with the plans.

08:40.469 --> 08:43.304
Unless she asks me to, and then
I absolutely will. -

08:43.304 --> 08:44.639
And her fiane is

08:44.640 --> 08:46.307
studying physics.

08:46.308 --> 08:48.443
They are going to be
such a power couple.

08:48.444 --> 08:52.013
Well, I think you two have
redefined that expression.

08:53.749 --> 08:55.183
Who wants more coffee?

08:55.184 --> 08:57.447
This evening, there's
a dinner at the White House

08:57.448 --> 08:59.754
with Penagos, Moreno,
McCord and Dalton families.

08:59.755 --> 09:01.756
Matt, the secretary's going to need

09:01.757 --> 09:03.391
some remarks for the dinner.

09:03.392 --> 09:05.259
Acknowledge the historic occasion,

09:05.260 --> 09:06.594
but keep it light.

09:06.595 --> 09:08.863
Portentous, but pithy. I got it.

09:08.864 --> 09:11.666
Can't imagine what it feels like
to be Juan-Luis or Soledad.

09:11.667 --> 09:13.167
I mean, when I was their age,

09:13.168 --> 09:15.036
I thought the pinnacle
of pressure was being

09:15.037 --> 09:17.105
director of my a cappella group.

09:17.106 --> 09:19.640
Now they're being
groomed to run for office.

09:19.641 --> 09:22.844
Maybe it'll inspire some of
our youth to put down Snapchat

09:22.845 --> 09:24.379
and aim a little higher.

09:24.380 --> 09:25.646
Seriously, it's like.

09:25.647 --> 09:28.416
<i>The Bachelorette but
with righteous politics</i>

09:28.417 --> 09:30.784
and, you know, world influence.

09:31.753 --> 09:32.936
What? That wasn't your point?

09:32.937 --> 09:34.822
The point is that

09:34.823 --> 09:36.858
- everyone loves a love story.
- Really?

09:36.859 --> 09:39.260
When it's real, it has
the power to change things.

09:40.696 --> 09:42.029
Sorry I'm late.

09:42.030 --> 09:44.399
Jay, we were just segueing

09:44.400 --> 09:47.702
from work talk to musing about
Soledad and Juan-Luis's romance.

09:47.703 --> 09:50.872
Really? 'Cause you know
we're up against it

09:50.873 --> 09:52.696
trying to implement this
ambitious aid program

09:52.697 --> 09:53.808
in South America.

09:53.809 --> 09:55.877
Now we hear that Venezuela's
getting cold feet?

09:55.878 --> 09:57.278
Okay.

09:57.279 --> 10:00.075
So we were going to increase
agricultural productivity

10:00.076 --> 10:01.517
and economic stability in the region

10:01.518 --> 10:03.861
while simultaneously hitting
the drug trade where it hurts,

10:03.862 --> 10:05.967
but now it looks like none
of that's gonna happen,

10:05.968 --> 10:06.798
so by all means,

10:06.799 --> 10:09.333
let's-let's just chat about
the wedding of the century.

10:10.168 --> 10:11.603
Um, you know,

10:11.604 --> 10:14.572
we should hurry so we're not
late for the press conference.

10:19.311 --> 10:21.880
Jay...

10:21.881 --> 10:24.416
I'm guessing that was about something

10:24.417 --> 10:26.685
other than frustration
with the Venezuelans.

10:26.686 --> 10:27.919
Are you all right?

10:27.920 --> 10:29.254
Yep. Sorry.

10:29.255 --> 10:32.289
It's just... a bad morning.

10:33.024 --> 10:34.860
Do you need to take the day?

10:34.861 --> 10:36.628
No. Thanks.

10:36.629 --> 10:38.329
Okay.

10:40.298 --> 10:42.434
- Yeah, you can do it.
- That would be great.

10:42.435 --> 10:44.402
Salutations, seventh floor dwellers.

10:44.403 --> 10:46.404
Hey, Kevin.

10:46.405 --> 10:47.418
Hey.

10:47.419 --> 10:49.541
Did you leave five bucks
for that cup of Joe?

10:49.542 --> 10:51.777
You think I want Daisy
Grant putting me on blast?

10:51.778 --> 10:53.681
I cadged some of that
fake vanilla creamer, too,

10:53.682 --> 10:55.313
in the interest of full disclosure.

10:57.383 --> 11:00.085
Hey, you notice how he answered
a question with a question?

11:00.086 --> 11:01.669
Well, that's not
answering the question.

11:01.670 --> 11:04.086
I mean, you're in PR.
You should know that.

11:04.087 --> 11:05.970
Seriously, let's see the fiver.

11:05.971 --> 11:07.572
- Okay. Bye, Kevin.
- What? I...

11:07.573 --> 11:08.740
What'd I do?

11:08.741 --> 11:11.612
So I was, um, gonna
stop by your office.

11:11.613 --> 11:13.247
Are we still on for tomorrow night?

11:13.248 --> 11:14.682
Absolutely.

11:14.683 --> 11:16.317
Unless something work-related comes up.

11:16.318 --> 11:17.752
I'm totally cool with that.

11:17.753 --> 11:19.554
Well, we don't have
too many late nights

11:19.555 --> 11:21.789
or sudden emergencies
in budgets and planning.

11:21.790 --> 11:24.659
So, stop by when
you're done for the day.

11:24.660 --> 11:26.359
I'll see you then.

11:30.665 --> 11:32.599
Get a room.

11:38.206 --> 11:40.141
Things are going well with Kevin.

11:40.142 --> 11:41.743
So far, so good.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.811
Just wish I could relax and enjoy it.

11:43.812 --> 11:45.380
Overthinking? You?

11:45.381 --> 11:47.548
I keep wondering, is there
something more here?

11:47.549 --> 11:50.752
God, I feel silly even
saying that out loud.

11:50.753 --> 11:53.054
There's nothing wrong
with looking to the future.

11:53.055 --> 11:55.680
And, as you said,
everyone loves a love story.

11:55.681 --> 11:58.326
To dream is no great feat in itself.

11:58.327 --> 12:00.094
Everyone dreams.

12:00.095 --> 12:03.063
History is made by those
with the courage to act.

12:03.064 --> 12:06.934
And today, it seems that
courage belongs to the young.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.670
Juan-Luis, Soledad,

12:09.671 --> 12:12.006
your story and your relentless drive

12:12.007 --> 12:14.975
to turn what you imagine into reality

12:14.976 --> 12:17.243
is an inspiration to us all.

12:20.848 --> 12:23.284
Thank you so much, Mr. President.

12:23.285 --> 12:26.620
We are thrilled to be here
in the United States,

12:26.621 --> 12:29.023
representing our beautiful country.

12:29.024 --> 12:31.525
Now, if you have
any questions, please.

12:31.526 --> 12:32.726
Yes.

12:32.727 --> 12:34.595
Can you tell us how you met?

12:36.264 --> 12:37.898
Um... sure.

12:37.899 --> 12:42.002
I... I-I had arrived at university

12:42.003 --> 12:44.071
when I learned that Soledad Penagos

12:44.072 --> 12:46.173
was attending the same school.

12:46.174 --> 12:50.010
And so I-I got up my courage,

12:50.011 --> 12:53.814
I knocked on her door, and when this

12:53.815 --> 12:56.717
beautiful, dark-haired girl answered,

12:56.718 --> 13:00.988
I said, "I am Juan-Luis Moreno,
son of President."

13:00.989 --> 13:02.957
"Natalia Moreno.

13:02.958 --> 13:04.592
"Don't you think it's time we do

13:04.593 --> 13:06.360
"what our parents'
generation could not,

13:06.361 --> 13:10.231
and end this terrible
conflict once and for all?"

13:10.232 --> 13:12.199
Unfortunately, he was
talking to my roommate.

13:13.735 --> 13:15.536
Later he found me at the library.

13:15.537 --> 13:18.439
Within an hour,
she presented me with a list

13:18.440 --> 13:21.976
of demands, government
representation for ECS...

13:23.245 --> 13:25.468
a transitional justice
system for guerrilla fighters,

13:25.469 --> 13:27.314
investment in infrastructure...

13:27.315 --> 13:29.483
And, of course, dinner.

13:29.484 --> 13:31.107
And-and dinner.

13:31.108 --> 13:32.586
That girl is a natural.

13:32.587 --> 13:34.722
She'll make a wonderful
president someday.

13:34.723 --> 13:36.690
The happiest day of my life

13:36.691 --> 13:40.127
was when our parents announced a truce,

13:40.128 --> 13:43.296
and, Juan-Luis got down
on one knee right there.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.035
Yes.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.970
You okay, man?

13:49.971 --> 13:52.840
Therapy with Abby didn't
go the way I hoped.

13:52.841 --> 13:55.242
She doesn't want to talk
about me coming home.

13:55.243 --> 13:57.411
And now she wants me to start calling

13:57.412 --> 14:00.047
at least an hour before
I come over and see Chloe.

14:01.917 --> 14:03.216
Sorry.

14:04.385 --> 14:08.322
I thought she wanted this
reconciliation to work,

14:08.323 --> 14:11.157
but maybe there's
something else going on.

14:13.627 --> 14:17.263
You mean like... someone else?

14:18.599 --> 14:19.867
I don't know.

14:22.504 --> 14:25.304
You guys
still on a family phone plan?

14:28.108 --> 14:31.445
I'm just saying, you can
look online at the records,

14:31.446 --> 14:33.728
and see if there's any number
that she's calling regularly

14:33.729 --> 14:34.752
that you don't recognize.

14:34.753 --> 14:36.750
<i>I saw it on Dateline.</i>

14:36.751 --> 14:38.786
Well, don't judge.

14:38.787 --> 14:41.154
I'm just saying if you want to know.

14:45.459 --> 14:47.061
I don't understand.

14:47.062 --> 14:49.964
She seemed fine at
the press conference.

14:49.965 --> 14:51.098
What's going on?

14:51.099 --> 14:54.234
They're not coming to the dinner.

14:54.235 --> 14:56.603
I'm guessing they didn't
get a better offer.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.038
Soledad is gone.

14:58.039 --> 15:00.542
She packed a bag, left
her fiance a "Dear Juan" letter

15:00.543 --> 15:02.476
calling off the wedding
and disappeared.

15:02.477 --> 15:05.713
Now President Moreno and
Penagos are tearing their hair out

15:05.714 --> 15:08.549
and blaming each other,
and the whole deal's unraveling.

15:08.550 --> 15:09.950
You can't honestly tell me

15:09.951 --> 15:12.653
that the only thing holding this
truce together was those kids.

15:12.654 --> 15:15.022
I mean, I... I know that the optics

15:15.023 --> 15:17.358
of the fairy tale
romance were appealing,

15:17.359 --> 15:20.194
but I believed that this was
rooted in something stronger.

15:20.195 --> 15:21.962
Well, I thought so, too, sir.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.164
I... In all of our discussions,

15:24.165 --> 15:26.900
Moreno and Penagos both
seemed deeply committed

15:26.901 --> 15:28.002
to moving forward.

15:28.003 --> 15:29.770
The whole aid package
is gonna fall apart.

15:29.771 --> 15:32.740
The fate of South America is
in the hands of a runaway bride.

15:32.741 --> 15:34.062
Any idea where she might've gone?

15:34.063 --> 15:35.846
No, but every
law enforcement agency

15:35.847 --> 15:37.311
in this city is on the case.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.480
God forbid anything happens to her.

15:39.481 --> 15:41.584
Well, she grew up evading
death squads in the jungles

15:41.585 --> 15:44.084
of Colombia, so I think she
can handle a night in D.C.

15:44.085 --> 15:45.886
Yeah, well let's hope
it's just one night.

15:45.887 --> 15:48.022
If we want to get Colombia
back on the peace train,

15:48.023 --> 15:50.357
we need to find Soledad Penagos fast.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:04.983 --> 16:07.682
Even if she is simply a runaway bride,

16:07.683 --> 16:10.271
you have put me in
a very difficult position.

16:10.272 --> 16:13.441
Based on your assurances that
peace in Colombia was on track,

16:13.442 --> 16:15.677
I convinced President
Alvarado that we should sign

16:15.678 --> 16:17.178
the Memorandum of Understanding

16:17.179 --> 16:19.314
and move forward with your aid package.

16:19.315 --> 16:22.217
And President Dalton is
still every bit as committed

16:22.218 --> 16:24.719
to seeing this peace treaty finalized

16:24.720 --> 16:27.589
next month, as planned,
with or without a wedding.

16:27.590 --> 16:28.990
Nevertheless, I must go back

16:28.991 --> 16:31.259
to Caracas and rather awkwardly

16:31.260 --> 16:33.495
withdraw my support for your memorandum

16:33.496 --> 16:35.563
until this situation is settled.

16:35.564 --> 16:38.933
Can you just stick around

16:38.934 --> 16:40.635
for another day?

16:40.636 --> 16:43.705
Just give us a chance
to straighten this out?

16:43.706 --> 16:44.839
Anything you need,

16:44.840 --> 16:46.241
my staff will provide it.

16:46.242 --> 16:49.177
And...

16:49.178 --> 16:53.948
<i>I might have a lead on a
couple of Hamilton tickets.</i>

16:53.949 --> 16:56.851
We could get you up to New York.

16:56.852 --> 16:58.620
Stay at the Plaza Hotel.

16:58.621 --> 17:00.522
I've already seen
the original cast,

17:02.691 --> 17:03.992
But, um...

17:03.993 --> 17:06.194
What about a membership

17:06.194 --> 17:09.296
at one of those big box
stores you have here?

17:11.266 --> 17:13.800
Yeah. You bet.

17:13.801 --> 17:16.938
Inflation in Venezuela makes
prices on basic goods very high.

17:16.939 --> 17:19.473
So if I can purchase
a few things in bulk,

17:19.474 --> 17:21.675
even with the cost of shipping,

17:21.676 --> 17:23.411
I'd be a hero to my mother.

17:23.412 --> 17:27.248
Yeah. I get it. I've got
a pantry full of toilet paper.

17:27.249 --> 17:28.650
We're gonna make that happen.

17:28.651 --> 17:29.834
Then you have until tomorrow.

17:33.188 --> 17:36.157
Um...

17:40.395 --> 17:41.596
Yeah?

17:41.597 --> 17:43.364
Hi. So sorry, again.

17:43.365 --> 17:44.999
But Stevie's here to see you,

17:45.000 --> 17:47.936
and she requests that you not be mad.

17:47.937 --> 17:49.771
Why would I be mad?

17:49.772 --> 17:53.307
Because she has Soledad
Penagos with her.

17:54.542 --> 17:55.777
Where have you been?

17:55.778 --> 17:58.313
I-I walked the streets for hours.

17:58.314 --> 18:00.949
Finally, I found a diner
where I drank terrible coffee

18:00.950 --> 18:03.351
- and I cried until the sun came up.
- My God.

18:03.352 --> 18:06.654
I-I didn't know...
I didn't know what to do.

18:06.655 --> 18:08.723
But then I remembered Stevie.

18:08.724 --> 18:11.392
I gave Soledad my number
in case she needed anything.

18:11.393 --> 18:14.062
It's fine. I-I'm just...
I'm glad you're okay.

18:14.063 --> 18:17.332
Everybody has been
worried sick about you.

18:17.333 --> 18:18.600
Well, she's not ready

18:18.601 --> 18:20.368
- to go back to the hotel yet.
- That's fine.

18:20.369 --> 18:23.137
But we at least have to let
everyone know that you're okay.

18:23.138 --> 18:24.801
I-I just can't face
any of them right now.

18:24.802 --> 18:26.674
Especially Juan-Luis.

18:26.675 --> 18:29.210
And my father...

18:29.211 --> 18:31.646
But I know what I want to do.

18:31.647 --> 18:33.081
And that is why I asked Stevie

18:33.082 --> 18:35.216
to bring me here.

18:35.217 --> 18:36.951
I need your help.

18:36.952 --> 18:38.653
Of course.

18:38.654 --> 18:40.321
I, wha... What can I do?

18:40.322 --> 18:42.257
Issue me a visa,

18:42.258 --> 18:45.693
so that I can stay and study medicine

18:45.694 --> 18:47.828
in the United States.

18:51.834 --> 18:53.268
<i>Hey, Mo.</i>

18:53.269 --> 18:54.435
How's he doing?

18:54.436 --> 18:56.504
Good. They're still
on military background,

18:56.505 --> 18:58.506
but they're about to drill
down on core philosophy.

18:58.507 --> 19:00.675
Ryan, combat bonafide,
he's a solid,

19:00.676 --> 19:03.511
but you know we're more
than a paramilitary group.

19:03.512 --> 19:07.282
We're soldiers doing
the Lord's work here on Earth.

19:07.283 --> 19:10.151
Bringing forth God's master plan.

19:10.152 --> 19:12.153
Revelation 14:13.

19:12.154 --> 19:13.755
"And I heard a voice

19:13.756 --> 19:16.224
"from heaven say unto me, Write,

19:16.225 --> 19:19.494
Blessed are the dead which die
in the Lord from henceforth."

19:19.495 --> 19:21.296
"Yea, saith the Spirit,

19:21.297 --> 19:23.231
"that they may rest from their labours;

19:23.232 --> 19:24.799
"And that their works

19:24.800 --> 19:26.227
do follow them."

19:26.228 --> 19:28.062
- You know your scripture.
- Nice.

19:28.063 --> 19:29.897
He did his homework.

19:29.898 --> 19:31.833
But have you submitted
to God's righteousness?

19:31.834 --> 19:33.434
When the Great Tribulation comes,

19:33.435 --> 19:34.876
only the worthy will be saved to sit

19:34.877 --> 19:35.940
at the feet of the Father.

19:35.941 --> 19:37.739
John 1:8.

19:37.740 --> 19:39.240
"If we say that we are without sin,"

19:39.241 --> 19:42.577
we deceive ourselves,

19:42.578 --> 19:44.511
"and the truth is not in us."

19:45.280 --> 19:46.781
I don't presume

19:46.782 --> 19:49.117
to tell Him that I'm worthy.

19:49.118 --> 19:50.952
I await His judgment.

19:50.953 --> 19:53.721
And for the chance to serve Him

19:53.722 --> 19:57.258
and bring about His will,

19:57.259 --> 19:59.393
I await yours.

20:00.495 --> 20:02.630
<i>Nice work, professor.</i>

20:02.631 --> 20:04.898
He's really got this down.

20:12.006 --> 20:14.475
No worldly possessions.

20:14.476 --> 20:16.144
We'll provide everything you need.

20:16.145 --> 20:17.211
There's the GPS.

20:17.212 --> 20:18.413
What about my truck?

20:18.414 --> 20:19.881
Is that a worldly possession, too?

20:19.882 --> 20:21.585
Necessary equipment
for the battle to come.

20:21.586 --> 20:22.517
Give me your keys.

20:22.518 --> 20:24.419
I'll drive it to the compound.

20:24.420 --> 20:26.553
Feel better driving my own vehicle.

20:32.093 --> 20:34.462
I'm afraid I can't let you
see where we've made camp.

20:34.463 --> 20:35.966
Not until you've proven your loyalty.

20:35.967 --> 20:38.501
I don't like the sound of that.

20:40.501 --> 20:42.470
Damn it.

20:45.973 --> 20:48.743
Can we get a drone out there?
Some kind of tail?

20:48.744 --> 20:51.011
Not in time.

20:51.979 --> 20:57.085
Yesterday, when President
Dalton spoke about dreams,

20:57.086 --> 20:59.354
and the courage to act on them,

20:59.355 --> 21:02.090
I realized I still want to be a doctor.

21:02.091 --> 21:05.159
Soledad, you can get married
and still become a doctor.

21:05.160 --> 21:07.595
I don't know what I feel anymore.

21:07.596 --> 21:10.031
Our relationship has never been

21:10.032 --> 21:12.533
ours alone.

21:12.534 --> 21:16.604
It was always wrapped up in politics.

21:16.605 --> 21:19.006
He even proposed to me
in front of our parents

21:19.007 --> 21:21.542
and the Colombian press.

21:21.543 --> 21:23.911
I just need...

21:23.912 --> 21:28.249
time... to think.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.484
Where's Soledad?

21:29.485 --> 21:31.119
Stevie told me you have her.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.254
<i>I don't have her.</i>

21:33.255 --> 21:36.924
She's in my office,
filling out a visa application,

21:36.925 --> 21:38.754
so she can study medicine in the U.S.

21:38.755 --> 21:40.739
Really hoping you were
gonna talk her out of that.

21:40.740 --> 21:41.482
Russell, I...

21:41.483 --> 21:43.451
This is all Stevie's doing, isn't it?

21:43.452 --> 21:44.619
I know how she thinks.

21:44.620 --> 21:46.754
She's-she's got the girl
running with wolves

21:46.755 --> 21:49.090
and-and-and following her bliss.

21:49.091 --> 21:50.892
Damn it! I...

21:50.893 --> 21:52.814
I know better
than to trust interns

21:52.815 --> 21:54.649
with anything bigger
than a lunch order.

21:54.650 --> 21:56.242
It was Dalton's speech

21:56.243 --> 21:58.104
yesterday that made her rethink

21:58.105 --> 22:00.340
her future plans.

22:00.341 --> 22:01.808
His words spoke to her.

22:01.809 --> 22:04.477
You're kidding.

22:04.478 --> 22:05.845
The dream into action bit?

22:05.846 --> 22:08.248
She's a revolutionary.
She'd never heard that before?

22:08.249 --> 22:09.856
Maybe it was hearing it

22:09.857 --> 22:11.985
in a different context.

22:11.986 --> 22:13.569
And kidnapping
to achieve their aims.

22:13.570 --> 22:16.156
We did what we had to
do in order to survive,

22:16.157 --> 22:19.726
all the while being-being hunted
by government-backed hit squads.

22:19.727 --> 22:22.495
You should still be classified
as a terrorist organization.

22:22.496 --> 22:24.364
Now let's not dwell on the past.

22:24.365 --> 22:28.168
ECS renounced kidnapping and
violence against civilians.

22:28.169 --> 22:30.170
I should have never
agreed to waive tribunals.

22:30.171 --> 22:31.914
The guilty should pay
for what they've done!

22:31.915 --> 22:32.872
I couldn't agree more.

22:32.873 --> 22:36.576
Elected officials with blood on
their hands should be jailed!

22:36.577 --> 22:38.778
Okay. Have you seen Soledad?

22:38.779 --> 22:42.115
Is it true she-she wants to
leave me and stay in the U.S.?

22:42.116 --> 22:44.249
She doesn't know what
she wants right now.

22:47.287 --> 22:50.824
I know that you are disappointed

22:50.825 --> 22:52.926
that she's having second
thoughts about the wedding,

22:52.927 --> 22:56.396
but I am certain...

22:56.397 --> 22:58.231
that she has not changed her mind

22:58.232 --> 22:59.266
about the peace treaty.

22:59.267 --> 23:01.835
Peace can hold if you both

23:01.836 --> 23:03.470
are still committed to signing it.

23:03.471 --> 23:04.604
I'm very sorry,

23:04.605 --> 23:06.640
President Dalton.

23:06.641 --> 23:09.009
This broken engagement is just another

23:09.010 --> 23:11.378
in a long line of betrayals.

23:11.379 --> 23:13.042
I can no longer see
an end to the conflict

23:13.043 --> 23:14.614
until ECS is finished.

23:14.615 --> 23:16.383
When I was ten years old,

23:16.384 --> 23:20.220
my father was murdered by
the Colombian government,

23:20.221 --> 23:21.655
gunned down

23:21.656 --> 23:24.357
in front of me and my sister

23:24.358 --> 23:26.860
for the crime of reporting the truth

23:26.861 --> 23:29.129
about state-sponsored corruption.

23:29.130 --> 23:33.800
I pledged my life then to this cause,

23:33.801 --> 23:36.735
and I will never abandon it.

23:41.341 --> 23:42.642
The State Department

23:42.643 --> 23:44.611
will keep working on inducements

23:44.612 --> 23:46.846
to bring you all back to the table.

23:46.847 --> 23:48.615
There is no trust.

23:48.616 --> 23:52.485
And when there is no trust,
there can be no agreement.

23:52.486 --> 23:55.922
We will fly home tomorrow.

23:55.923 --> 23:57.790
Come on, Juan-Luis.

24:06.333 --> 24:07.500
Here are the remarks.

24:07.501 --> 24:09.069
Thanks.

24:09.070 --> 24:11.271
What's up?

24:11.272 --> 24:14.407
He took your advice and
checked Abby's phone records.

24:14.408 --> 24:16.476
Any strange numbers?

24:16.477 --> 24:19.346
Yeah. There's one.

24:19.347 --> 24:21.570
Started calling about a week
after I left the apartment.

24:21.571 --> 24:24.351
First it was short
calls every other day.

24:24.352 --> 24:27.354
Now it's every day, and the
calls are getting longer.

24:27.355 --> 24:30.056
You try the number?

24:30.057 --> 24:32.392
It just goes to a robot voice
saying that no voicemail's

24:32.393 --> 24:33.892
been set up for this account.

24:38.698 --> 24:40.033
Sounds like a burner phone.

24:40.034 --> 24:41.568
That's what you get

24:41.569 --> 24:43.792
when you don't want someone
looking into your call logs.

24:43.793 --> 24:45.305
<i>Is this more Dateline?</i>

24:45.306 --> 24:48.373
It's semi-legitimate journalism.

24:49.943 --> 24:52.846
She's calling this new
number from her own phone.

24:52.847 --> 24:54.514
Maybe she has nothing to hide.

24:54.515 --> 24:56.116
I should just ask her, right?

24:56.117 --> 24:58.550
I...

24:59.285 --> 25:01.221
Hey, it's me.

25:01.222 --> 25:04.224
I was wondering if I can come
over later and see Chloe.

25:04.225 --> 25:07.660
Kevin? You ready?

25:08.829 --> 25:11.498
You weren't playing
about no stress here

25:11.499 --> 25:13.465
in Budget and Planning.

25:16.336 --> 25:17.803
Hey.

25:25.145 --> 25:27.846
My God.

25:35.021 --> 25:37.557
Yes, I have an emergency.

25:37.558 --> 25:41.660
A man is... I-I think he's dead.

25:54.348 --> 25:56.849
I'm so sorry.

25:56.850 --> 25:58.851
Thank you. You didn't
have to wait around.

25:58.852 --> 26:01.152
I'm okay.

26:12.798 --> 26:15.935
I don't, I don't think it's hit me yet.

26:15.936 --> 26:17.970
Everything I want to say sounds trite.

26:17.971 --> 26:19.087
The cops were asking me

26:19.088 --> 26:21.375
all these personal questions about him.

26:21.541 --> 26:23.109
Where's he from?

26:23.110 --> 26:24.844
Where do his parents live?

26:24.845 --> 26:28.581
I mean, we never even
talked about that stuff.

26:28.582 --> 26:31.450
I hardly knew him at all.

26:31.451 --> 26:34.652
How do you mourn something that
never really even got started?

26:36.155 --> 26:40.026
Kierkegaard said...

26:40.027 --> 26:43.195
"The most painful state of being

26:43.196 --> 26:46.064
is remembering the future".

27:10.323 --> 27:12.258
Hey, I was just about to call you.

27:12.259 --> 27:14.260
She fell asleep a few minutes ago.

27:14.261 --> 27:17.430
Sorry... about the buzzer.

27:17.431 --> 27:18.764
You cut your hair.

27:18.765 --> 27:23.435
Yeah, I got it done at lunch,
kind of an impulse.

27:24.837 --> 27:26.471
Can I come in?

27:27.840 --> 27:30.141
Okay. Sure.

27:34.981 --> 27:36.716
How's work?

27:36.717 --> 27:39.452
I-it's an adjustment
being back full-time,

27:39.453 --> 27:43.155
but, um, so far so good. You?

27:43.156 --> 27:46.025
Our South American
aid package is on hold

27:46.026 --> 27:48.861
because the Colombian peace
treaty is falling apart.

27:48.862 --> 27:50.529
Soledad Penagos called off the wedding.

27:50.530 --> 27:52.932
I know, I read about it everywhere.

27:52.933 --> 27:56.335
Yeah. She's not in love
with him anymore.

27:56.336 --> 27:59.170
Maybe she'll change her mind.

28:04.076 --> 28:06.145
I'm sorry, Jay. I...

28:06.146 --> 28:08.080
Right, right, right, right. It's okay.

28:08.081 --> 28:12.484
I should go.
I'm meeting guys for drinks.

28:13.252 --> 28:14.520
Yeah, I wanted to ask you

28:14.521 --> 28:15.728
about the phone bill.

28:15.729 --> 28:17.628
Yeah, I paid it.

28:19.965 --> 28:23.568
You look... really beautiful
with your hair like that.

28:24.737 --> 28:27.005
Thank you.

28:31.845 --> 28:33.913
Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.

28:33.914 --> 28:36.015
No, I-I was waiting up for you.

28:36.016 --> 28:37.959
With the pillow over your
head and the light off?

28:37.960 --> 28:39.752
Well, I didn't say I was successful.

28:39.753 --> 28:41.787
How was your day?

28:41.788 --> 28:43.856
Soledad still isn't talking

28:43.857 --> 28:45.658
with Juan-Luis.

28:45.659 --> 28:49.728
Nadine says that Jay and Abby
have hit another rough patch.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.664
You ready for this?

28:51.665 --> 28:55.768
A State Department employee died today,

28:55.769 --> 28:57.436
a guy from Budget and Planning.

28:57.437 --> 29:00.406
Daisy found him in his office.

29:00.407 --> 29:01.974
They were dating.

29:01.975 --> 29:04.043
My God.

29:04.044 --> 29:05.110
What happened?

29:05.111 --> 29:06.745
They think it was a heart attack.

29:06.746 --> 29:10.482
Probably some congenital
condition he didn't know about.

29:10.483 --> 29:11.483
How's Daisy doing?

29:11.484 --> 29:15.686
She's shocked and sad.

29:18.123 --> 29:21.993
This is not a good day for love.

29:23.729 --> 29:26.097
I'm sorry, babe.

29:32.638 --> 29:36.675
What is it with women
and the fairy tale?

29:36.676 --> 29:39.578
Even if you grow up

29:39.579 --> 29:45.017
thinking you want to look
life square in the eye,

29:45.018 --> 29:49.655
there's still this
part of you that's...

29:49.656 --> 29:54.426
looking for the pink, bubbly,
happily-ever-after thing.

29:57.063 --> 29:58.764
Or maybe it's just me.

29:58.765 --> 30:01.200
No, not at all.

30:01.201 --> 30:04.870
I am lying here, hoping for some
of that happily-ever-after thing

30:04.871 --> 30:06.304
with Ian right now.

30:09.441 --> 30:10.776
He's not Dmitri.

30:10.777 --> 30:13.312
I know.

30:13.313 --> 30:15.681
He's a trained field agent,
he's been in tough spots before.

30:15.682 --> 30:18.017
He even made it into
the compound safely.

30:18.018 --> 30:21.220
No, this is about me coming
to terms with the idea

30:21.221 --> 30:24.857
that part of this job...

30:24.858 --> 30:27.493
if I continue to do it...

30:27.494 --> 30:29.061
is putting people at risk.

30:29.062 --> 30:33.798
And the better job you're doing,
the more at risk they are.

30:37.202 --> 30:39.537
How inured to that do I want to get?

30:41.774 --> 30:45.010
Just enough.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.845
Did I tell you she got a haircut?

30:46.846 --> 30:49.048
Not in the last 30 seconds.

30:49.049 --> 30:50.416
Women cut their hair

30:50.417 --> 30:52.418
when they get out of bad
relationships, don't they?

30:52.419 --> 30:54.123
It's like, it's like
the hair is a metaphor

30:54.124 --> 30:56.128
for their sadness and regret,
so off it comes.

30:56.129 --> 30:57.712
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.

30:57.713 --> 30:58.880
Now she's unfettered.

30:58.881 --> 31:00.582
Free of me.

31:00.583 --> 31:01.502
Or she could've gotten a haircut

31:01.503 --> 31:03.687
because her hair got damaged
from too much blow drying.

31:03.688 --> 31:04.519
Hey, guys.

31:04.520 --> 31:05.887
Hey, Scott.

31:05.888 --> 31:07.111
Looks like I need to catch up.

31:07.112 --> 31:08.523
Good luck with that.

31:08.524 --> 31:09.491
You want another round?

31:09.492 --> 31:12.059
- Yes.
- No.

31:12.727 --> 31:14.196
Come on,

31:14.197 --> 31:15.564
you're not calling Abby again.

31:15.565 --> 31:19.534
Look, short hair is not
a metaphor, I promise.

31:19.535 --> 31:21.336
The pixie is back.

31:21.337 --> 31:22.800
I'm trying the mystery number again.

31:22.801 --> 31:25.207
Maybe I didn't have
the guts to ask Abby

31:25.208 --> 31:27.111
if she's seeing someone,
but I can damn well ask

31:27.112 --> 31:29.946
the someone if he's seeing Abby.

31:34.482 --> 31:35.717
Did you hear that?

31:35.718 --> 31:36.818
Yeah, there's, like,

31:36.819 --> 31:39.020
a hundred phones in here, though.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.892
Come on, not me, dude.

31:43.893 --> 31:46.760
I'm a little offended
you'd even think so.

31:58.373 --> 32:00.756
Just ran into my pal Travis.
He and his crew are headed over

32:00.757 --> 32:02.944
to Ajax in a few if we want to join.

32:02.945 --> 32:05.212
What?

32:14.681 --> 32:16.081
Hey.

32:17.684 --> 32:18.819
Good morning.

32:18.820 --> 32:20.352
How'd it go with Abby?

32:25.093 --> 32:28.795
About like you'd expect.

32:28.796 --> 32:31.865
She felt terrible that
she hadn't told me

32:31.866 --> 32:33.633
about her and Scott.

32:33.634 --> 32:35.902
It's true?

32:35.903 --> 32:39.039
I'm sorry, man.

32:39.040 --> 32:43.810
She said it started with him
being a shoulder to cry on.

32:43.811 --> 32:46.513
Nothing physical's happened yet.

32:46.514 --> 32:48.814
But...

32:50.984 --> 32:55.389
she said that, she
wants to see where it goes.

32:55.390 --> 32:58.358
With a guy that would stab
you in the back like that?

32:58.359 --> 32:59.860
It's not right, man.

32:59.861 --> 33:01.360
I'll be fine.

33:05.832 --> 33:08.935
There's no way you're really this okay.

33:08.936 --> 33:11.570
I'm not even remotely this okay.

33:12.973 --> 33:15.513
I'm just waiting to get my own
place to start smashing things.

33:16.309 --> 33:18.577
That's considerate.

33:21.015 --> 33:22.015
Morning, ma'am.

33:22.016 --> 33:23.583
Morning.

33:23.584 --> 33:25.685
I've arranged for
Foreign Minister Rojas

33:25.686 --> 33:28.388
to ship his bulk purchases
through our diplomatic pouch,

33:28.389 --> 33:30.223
however he said he
cannot wait any longer

33:30.224 --> 33:32.259
to discuss signing the M.O.U.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.828
And that, if there's no word
on the peace deal today,

33:34.829 --> 33:37.464
he's going to return to Venezuela.

33:37.465 --> 33:41.601
You always deliver bad news
with a strong cup of coffee.

33:41.602 --> 33:43.336
I like that about you, Blake.

33:43.337 --> 33:44.471
Thank you.

33:44.472 --> 33:46.339
Hey, Nadine.

33:46.340 --> 33:48.508
How's everybody here holding up?

33:48.509 --> 33:51.945
Well, Jay and Daisy
are inconsolable,

33:51.946 --> 33:54.714
but they would rather be
at work than sit at home.

33:54.715 --> 33:56.850
Well, unfortunately,
with the deal the way it is,

33:56.851 --> 33:59.619
there's not much for
them to do around here.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.888
You think that
Juan-Luis and Soledad

34:01.889 --> 34:03.590
would put the well-being
of three nations

34:03.591 --> 34:05.958
above their lover's spat.

34:08.594 --> 34:10.697
Okay, sorry, I'm a little
romance fatigued.

34:10.697 --> 34:12.799
If we could just get Romeo and Juliet

34:12.800 --> 34:14.134
in the same room together...

34:14.135 --> 34:15.502
I did try to schedule a meeting

34:15.503 --> 34:18.405
so you could appeal to them directly.

34:18.406 --> 34:21.373
They have both respectfully declined.

34:23.377 --> 34:27.112
Maybe we're not the right
people to be asking.

34:35.922 --> 34:37.090
Hey.

34:37.091 --> 34:39.426
Hey, your mom sent me
for Soledad. Is she here?

34:39.427 --> 34:41.228
Yeah, she's on the couch.

34:41.228 --> 34:43.929
Um, she hasn't moved since yesterday,

34:43.931 --> 34:45.866
and I don't know what to do, she's...

34:45.867 --> 34:47.199
Let me see...

34:52.473 --> 34:54.335
I'm Daisy Grant from
Secretary McCord's office.

34:54.337 --> 34:56.610
I've got as much reason to
wallow in misery as you do,

34:56.610 --> 34:59.312
but I'm not doing that,
and you want to know why?

34:59.313 --> 35:01.880
Because I've done that
before and it leads nowhere.

35:09.890 --> 35:12.359
Juan-Luis.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.094
<i>CÃ³mo Te Va?</i>

35:14.095 --> 35:15.262
I'm Jay Whitman.

35:15.263 --> 35:17.363
Secretary McCord sent
me to talk to you.

35:18.765 --> 35:20.767
Your mother told me that you were here.

35:20.768 --> 35:23.068
Has Soledad changed her mind?

35:24.004 --> 35:25.505
<i>Pues...</i>

35:25.506 --> 35:28.140
You have nothing to say
that I want to talk about.

35:30.577 --> 35:32.245
My wife left me four weeks ago.

35:32.246 --> 35:34.314
Now she's dating my best friend.

35:34.315 --> 35:36.298
If a stranger came up to
me and said he might know

35:36.299 --> 35:37.918
how to save my marriage,

35:37.919 --> 35:39.519
I would listen to him.

35:39.520 --> 35:42.022
It occurred to me this morning

35:42.023 --> 35:43.790
that in all of the excitement

35:43.791 --> 35:46.960
of two young people falling in love,

35:46.961 --> 35:49.596
negotiating a historic truce,

35:49.597 --> 35:52.232
and saving Colombia...

35:52.233 --> 35:55.802
well, we might have forgotten
how very young you really are.

35:55.803 --> 36:00.240
I was right out of college
when I married my husband.

36:00.241 --> 36:01.675
And then shortly thereafter,

36:01.676 --> 36:03.710
he went into combat as a fighter pilot.

36:03.711 --> 36:06.346
So, on top of being
worried sick about him,

36:06.347 --> 36:09.082
I hardly ever saw him for
more than a week at a time,

36:09.083 --> 36:11.718
until he was discharged
a couple of years later.

36:11.719 --> 36:14.187
Came home and...

36:14.188 --> 36:18.024
we had to get to know
each other all over again.

36:18.025 --> 36:20.827
Fall in love all over again.

36:20.828 --> 36:23.930
All while raising a new baby.

36:23.931 --> 36:27.667
Believe me, that was not what
I had imagined for myself

36:27.668 --> 36:30.136
as a young girl.

36:30.137 --> 36:33.206
And at times it felt...

36:33.207 --> 36:35.875
like the dream had died.

36:35.876 --> 36:40.647
Took me a while to realize
it was just simply replaced

36:40.648 --> 36:44.584
by something stronger and better.

36:44.585 --> 36:47.988
Now, Henry and I didn't have the fate

36:47.989 --> 36:50.490
of our country on our hands,

36:50.491 --> 36:53.093
just the future of our family,

36:53.094 --> 36:56.895
and even that, at times,
felt overwhelming.

36:58.765 --> 37:02.335
I can't imagine the kind
of pressure that you feel.

37:02.336 --> 37:04.771
But now's the time to put aside

37:04.772 --> 37:07.207
your personal anguish, and focus

37:07.208 --> 37:09.709
on what brought you
together in the first place,

37:09.710 --> 37:13.380
your incredible, bold vision

37:13.381 --> 37:17.550
for ending your country's
half-century of suffering.

37:17.551 --> 37:20.020
I'm asking you to reach inside

37:20.021 --> 37:24.691
and find the strength,

37:24.692 --> 37:26.026
and take the lead again.

37:26.027 --> 37:27.894
I'm asking you to trust that,

37:27.895 --> 37:33.120
behind the dream,
is something more important.

37:42.422 --> 37:46.837
We've talked it over, and no
matter what happens between us,

37:47.384 --> 37:49.306
we want this truce to succeed.

37:49.307 --> 37:51.460
<i>SÃ­, for the good of Colombia.</i>

37:51.461 --> 37:53.658
The deal is already worked out.

37:53.659 --> 37:56.192
All you have to do is put
aside your differences

37:56.193 --> 37:57.160
and honor it.

37:57.161 --> 37:59.095
I fear it's too late.

37:59.096 --> 38:01.397
There are too many old grievances.

38:01.398 --> 38:04.033
Too much blood has been shed.

38:04.034 --> 38:07.303
Sometimes I think the only
thing you two will agree on

38:07.304 --> 38:08.871
is that you won't agree on anything.

38:08.872 --> 38:12.008
You make it sound so
simple, but it's not.

38:12.009 --> 38:13.943
Congress still has to
approve the treaty,

38:13.944 --> 38:15.278
and now support is lagging.

38:15.279 --> 38:16.579
No.

38:16.580 --> 38:18.123
They'll approve it if you stand by it.

38:18.124 --> 38:19.182
Put your weight behind it.

38:19.183 --> 38:20.650
Sole and I are still going to.

38:20.651 --> 38:21.994
You and Soledad are young.

38:21.995 --> 38:23.853
You don't understand
the world the way we do.

38:23.854 --> 38:25.237
I think they understand

38:25.238 --> 38:26.343
something more important.

38:26.344 --> 38:28.191
They understand how it can be.

38:28.192 --> 38:29.353
That's why they'll change it.

38:29.354 --> 38:31.057
You two have
been fighting this war

38:31.058 --> 38:32.328
your entire lives.

38:32.329 --> 38:33.896
Now you're so entrenched,

38:33.897 --> 38:35.800
you can't even see that
there's something better

38:35.801 --> 38:36.899
waiting on the other side

38:36.900 --> 38:38.167
of the conflict.

38:38.168 --> 38:40.336
But your children can see it.

38:40.337 --> 38:42.238
They just need your
help to make it real.

38:42.239 --> 38:44.407
MamÃ¡,

38:44.408 --> 38:46.743
don't give up on us.

38:46.744 --> 38:48.076
<i>Please, PapÃ¡.</i>

38:58.988 --> 39:01.357
<i>All right, mijo.</i>

39:01.358 --> 39:02.657
We'll try.

39:08.098 --> 39:10.266
Ma'am, you done did
a terrible thing to me.

39:12.002 --> 39:13.936
You made me glad I ain't in Texas.

39:15.672 --> 39:16.773
Who is it?

39:16.774 --> 39:18.541
FBI, open the door.

39:18.542 --> 39:21.944
Every time I look at you,
I say to myself...

39:21.945 --> 39:23.146
What's going on?

39:23.147 --> 39:25.815
Ms. Grant, we have a warrant
to search the premises.

39:25.816 --> 39:26.783
Search for what?

39:26.784 --> 39:27.884
That's classified.

39:27.885 --> 39:29.468
And I'm gonna need you to come with me.

39:29.469 --> 39:30.653
I have security clearance.

39:30.654 --> 39:32.721
Nevertheless, I need
you to come with me.

39:39.128 --> 39:41.230
What happened?

39:41.231 --> 39:42.999
Leaders just busted in,

39:43.000 --> 39:44.801
and dragged the three
new recruits out of bed.

39:44.802 --> 39:46.425
They're talking about
a cleansing ritual,

39:46.426 --> 39:48.104
a-a baptism?

39:48.105 --> 39:50.573
Looks like they're taking them
into some kind of a bunker.

39:50.574 --> 39:52.597
Gentlemen, you have
asked to join our ranks,

39:52.598 --> 39:54.777
and you have been found worthy.

39:54.778 --> 39:56.546
It is time for you to
declare your servitude

39:56.547 --> 39:58.448
to our great cause.

39:58.449 --> 40:01.317
Samuel.

40:01.318 --> 40:03.051
Step forward to be baptized.

40:04.387 --> 40:06.688
On your knees.

40:09.125 --> 40:10.593
Why are they restraining him?

40:10.594 --> 40:12.128
Samuel, do you accept Him

40:12.129 --> 40:13.296
into your heart?

40:13.297 --> 40:14.363
I do.

40:14.364 --> 40:16.132
Are you ready to be
baptized and reborn?

40:16.133 --> 40:18.233
I am.

40:18.901 --> 40:21.537
"I indeed baptize you with water"

40:21.538 --> 40:24.807
but he that
cometh after me is mightier

40:24.808 --> 40:27.577
"than I, whose shoes
I am not worthy to bear:."

40:27.578 --> 40:28.811
"He shall baptize you"

40:28.812 --> 40:30.279
with the Holy Ghost,

40:30.280 --> 40:32.144
- "and with fire."
- They're not letting him up.

40:32.145 --> 40:33.711
Let him go! You're...

40:35.157 --> 40:37.526
<i>That's how they
prove their loyalty.</i>

40:37.527 --> 40:39.160
Being willing to die.

40:41.597 --> 40:43.031
Praise God, Samuel.

40:43.032 --> 40:44.900
You are risen!

40:44.901 --> 40:46.902
He has seen fit to grant you new life.

40:46.903 --> 40:49.338
Ryan.

40:49.339 --> 40:51.073
Come forward.

40:51.074 --> 40:52.240
No. Get out of there.

41:01.350 --> 41:03.619
Do you accept
Him into your heart?

41:03.620 --> 41:05.153
I do.

41:05.154 --> 41:06.977
- Are you ready to be baptized...
- No.

41:06.978 --> 41:08.490
And reborn?

41:08.491 --> 41:09.758
I am.

41:09.759 --> 41:10.891
No, no, no.

41:27.142 --> 41:28.944
Thank God.

41:28.945 --> 41:30.946
Daisy, I'm so sorry.

41:30.947 --> 41:33.582
- Okay.
- Ma'am, with all due respect,

41:33.583 --> 41:34.916
what the hell is going on?

41:34.917 --> 41:37.451
I just got read in a few minutes ago.

41:39.154 --> 41:40.989
Kevin Park.

41:40.990 --> 41:44.092
His real name was Joseph Garcia.

41:44.093 --> 41:45.661
What?

41:45.662 --> 41:46.762
That's insane.

41:46.763 --> 41:48.484
How do you get a job
at the State Department

41:48.485 --> 41:49.428
under a false identity?

41:49.429 --> 41:51.308
No, he-he didn't work for
the State Department.

41:51.309 --> 41:53.235
He was a CIA operative.

41:53.236 --> 41:57.606
He was using his position
in our offices as cover

41:57.607 --> 42:00.008
for a highly classified investigation.

42:00.009 --> 42:03.245
What... what kind
of classified investigation?

42:03.246 --> 42:04.946
I don't get it.

42:04.947 --> 42:07.616
They couldn't really tell
me any more than that.

42:09.485 --> 42:12.320
But, Daisy, they did tell me

42:12.321 --> 42:13.588
the coroner's report came back

42:13.589 --> 42:16.358
and he didn't die of natural causes.

42:16.359 --> 42:18.627
It was cyanide poisoning.

42:18.628 --> 42:22.096
Wait. They think he killed himself?

42:22.864 --> 42:26.433
No. They think he was murdered.
