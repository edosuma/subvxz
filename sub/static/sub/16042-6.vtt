14:06.000 --> 14:09.538
But listen, you would
be taken care of.

14:09.620 --> 14:12.191
We... pay our engineers
very well.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.820
-Hey, dude.
It's Nick Talman.

14:16.830 --> 14:18.786
Um, I'm good. I'm good.

14:18.830 --> 14:21.822
Thank you. Uh, I'm really good.
How are things in California?

14:21.830 --> 14:23.900
Wonderful investment
opportunity, but, um,

14:23.950 --> 14:25.998
you would have to move
very quick on it.
That's the thing.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.656
No, I know.

14:28.700 --> 14:31.248
I-- I will. I-- no, okay, wh--
okay, let me just say...

14:32.700 --> 14:34.190
JP, it's Nick Talman.

14:34.250 --> 14:36.491
Excellent. I'm so happy to--
let me tell you.

14:36.540 --> 14:38.030
So, I have an amazing--

14:38.080 --> 14:40.036
I know, this sounds
ridiculous, but--

14:40.080 --> 14:41.991
but-- but you don't know that.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.070
Dude, are you
still in Nashville?

14:46.160 --> 14:48.788
For me, I just feel like
you have to meet this girl.

14:48.830 --> 14:50.195
So, you're in Japan right now?

14:50.290 --> 14:52.440
You'll thank me
if you vet the code.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.151
Thank-- I--
look, I appreciate you
taking the time, and--

14:55.160 --> 14:57.902
you know what?
Actually, I'm gonna
call you back.

14:57.950 --> 14:58.996
No, I got m--

14:59.000 --> 15:00.991
Okay, I gotta go.
Call you right back.

15:02.330 --> 15:03.570
Hey, Leo.

15:03.620 --> 15:04.939
-Nick.

15:08.660 --> 15:09.866
We should talk.

15:12.410 --> 15:14.196
-I didn't know
what else to do.

15:14.250 --> 15:15.740
-I told you
I was dealing with it.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.497
-Uh-huh. You're in
way over your head, son.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.320
Wanna mix _us
a couple of drinks?

15:22.750 --> 15:23.899
-Okay.

17:47.450 --> 17:49.156
I haven't said
anything to Benny.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.491
I appreciate it.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.649
-But I'm gonna have to.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.826
Soon.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.689
Otherwise, I can be implicated.

17:59.750 --> 18:01.570
-Rea|ly?
-Nick.

18:01.620 --> 18:04.077
Listen very carefully
to what I'm about to say,

18:04.120 --> 18:05.360
'cause I don't think
that you have

18:05.410 --> 18:06.786
fully grasped this yet.

18:06.830 --> 18:07.899
Are you listening?

18:07.950 --> 18:09.076
-Yeah.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.570
-You committed
multiple felonies.

18:11.660 --> 18:13.196
-We got hacked. I mean--

18:13.250 --> 18:14.649
-But you didn't report it.

18:16.540 --> 18:18.690
And I know why, too.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.531
I know this isn't who you are.

18:21.620 --> 18:23.326
You're a good kid.
You're smart, you're caring,

18:23.370 --> 18:25.326
put people first.

18:25.370 --> 18:26.780
And whether you
believe this or not,

18:26.830 --> 18:28.320
I've always liked you.

18:28.330 --> 18:30.616
Breaks my heart that
this is happening now.

18:32.830 --> 18:34.320
Maybe she'll forgive you.

18:34.370 --> 18:36.941
My guess is she probably will
'cause she understands you.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.400
She wants you to be happy
'cause she loves you.

18:39.450 --> 18:40.826
And when you love somebody,

18:40.870 --> 18:42.940
that's all that matters.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.036
Not all this.

18:46.910 --> 18:49.071
So, here's what's
gonna happen next.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.997
I'm gonna pretend that
Taylor never came to me,

18:51.040 --> 18:53.747
I'm gonna pretend we never had
this conversation, you and me,

18:53.830 --> 18:55.650
and when I see Benny
tomorrow night for poker,

18:55.700 --> 18:58.191
I'm gonna act like everything
is sunshine and puppy dogs.

18:58.250 --> 19:02.038
But soon, very soon,
he's gonna start wondering

19:02.120 --> 19:04.941
what's happening
with the million and a half
that he gave ya.

19:06.790 --> 19:09.611
And at that point...

19:09.660 --> 19:11.491
there's nothing I can do
to protect you.

19:30.790 --> 19:32.030
Dada?

19:34.200 --> 19:35.827
-Hm?
-Guess what?

19:35.870 --> 19:37.656
Touie wanted me
to tell you something.

19:37.700 --> 19:38.997
Guess what it is?

20:48.700 --> 20:49.906
-What do you want?

20:49.950 --> 20:51.690
-Let's go for a ride.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.286
-Hm?

21:24.450 --> 21:26.691
-I'll be gone
before you get home.

21:30.250 --> 21:31.820
-Okay. Good.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.819
-Hey.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.490
Yeah. Sure.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.286
Okay. That's fine.

22:06.330 --> 22:07.570
See you there.

22:43.830 --> 22:44.819
I don't have it yet.

22:46.370 --> 22:47.746
-I know, South Beach.

22:47.790 --> 22:49.280
That ain't why we're here.

22:49.330 --> 22:50.991
-Oh, yeah?

22:52.450 --> 22:54.247
-We're here to start a business.

22:55.910 --> 22:57.070
-I thought we already
tried that.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.576
-We tried it the Nick way,

22:58.620 --> 22:59.860
we tried it the Izzy way.

22:59.910 --> 23:01.992
Now we're about to
try It the Ronald way.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.490
How much money you got?

23:04.580 --> 23:06.491
-How much money
do I-- uh...

23:06.540 --> 23:07.655
do you mean on me?

23:08.700 --> 23:09.997
-Total. All in.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.325
What you worth?

23:11.330 --> 23:14.037
-Man, nothing.
I'm in debt.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.657
I've been paying off
a student loan for 10 years.

23:16.660 --> 23:18.150
-Shit!
-I know.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.572
-I've been in your spot.
How you pay your rent?

23:20.620 --> 23:22.576
-He doesn't.
His girl does.

23:22.620 --> 23:24.076
-Hey, you know...

23:26.450 --> 23:28.327
-Damn, South Beach.

23:28.370 --> 23:29.746
Okay.

23:29.790 --> 23:31.655
Okay, okay.
How much you got?

23:32.700 --> 23:34.031
-Nothing. I'm broke.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.490
-Damn.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.496
You ain't got
nothing stashed nowhere?

23:37.540 --> 23:39.189
Not even just a little bit?

23:39.250 --> 23:42.538
-I do have a rainy day fund.
I got a small bank account.

23:42.580 --> 23:44.036
-How much in there?
-Uh...

23:44.080 --> 23:47.538
I would have to check,
but I have like $17,000.

23:47.580 --> 23:49.491
-17?
-Yeah.

23:49.500 --> 23:51.991
-All right, I got
three G's stashed in the closet.
17 plus three, that's 20.

23:52.040 --> 23:53.530
We got 20 large liquid.

23:53.620 --> 23:54.826
All right, that's gonna
be enough.

23:54.870 --> 23:56.610
-What are you saying?

23:56.660 --> 23:57.695
-I'm saying...

23:59.160 --> 24:01.321
we've been going
about this all wrong.

24:01.330 --> 24:02.900
We were trying
to lock down the big busts

24:02.950 --> 24:04.497
before we even
got the swagger right.

24:04.580 --> 24:05.899
You dig?

24:05.950 --> 24:08.032
-Swa-- Okay, I guess.
"The swagger"?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.490
-Y'a|| want to start something?

24:11.540 --> 24:13.861
-Yeah.
-We need to stop
looking at this shit

24:13.910 --> 24:16.868
like it's some West Coast,
incubated, garage-type bullshit.

24:20.870 --> 24:23.942
This here Miami, y'all.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.197
A nigga can have
the most revolutionary idea
since the Internet,

24:27.250 --> 24:28.990
and ain't nobody
gonna take you seriously

24:29.000 --> 24:30.991
unless you got the swagger.

24:32.250 --> 24:33.490
-Okay.

24:34.790 --> 24:36.826
-We take our 20 g's,

24:36.870 --> 24:38.997
we find us a cheap space
in Wynwood, act like

24:39.040 --> 24:40.826
we going all fucking hipster
or some shit,

24:40.830 --> 24:44.493
hire up a bunch of interns,
some smart,

24:44.500 --> 24:46.650
some just to sit there
looking fine,

24:46.660 --> 24:49.322
act like we've been at it
for a minute, you feel me?

24:49.370 --> 24:52.328
Act like we already
been out there raising funds

24:52.370 --> 24:56.079
and shit's going
real good, you dig?

24:56.120 --> 24:58.190
Make 'em think when
they walk through that door,

24:58.250 --> 25:00.400
they about to be a part
of something new,

25:00.450 --> 25:01.747
something cuttin' edge,

25:01.790 --> 25:04.782
something folks is begging
to invest in.

25:04.830 --> 25:06.491
Izzy, you got the code.

25:06.540 --> 25:09.077
Nick, you know about money.
I know about selling.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.366
Three 0' us...

25:11.500 --> 25:14.446
_ we can _own
this damn City, y'all.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.786
But if we want folks to
start taking us seriously,

25:16.830 --> 25:19.697
_ we need to act
like we already do.

25:31.790 --> 25:34.111
-Stupid kids...

25:34.160 --> 25:35.491
never gave me notice.

25:35.540 --> 25:36.825
Never heard from 'em.

25:40.620 --> 25:42.360
What was their company?

25:42.410 --> 25:43.946
-Eh, who the hell knows?

25:44.000 --> 25:47.367
Some dumb, little video game
thing like an app? I don't know.

25:47.410 --> 25:48.741
What do you guys do?

25:48.830 --> 25:51.321
Not thinking about maybe
buying the place, are you?

25:51.330 --> 25:52.649
Uh, no, no.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.406
We were thinking of something
much more short-term.

25:54.500 --> 25:55.740
We're thinking
about a month.

25:55.830 --> 25:57.115
-Just a month?

25:57.160 --> 25:59.492
-Yeah, but, you know,
if things go well,

25:59.540 --> 26:01.656
we could maybe-- we could
maybe work something out.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.406
-One month,
10,000 flat.

26:06.450 --> 26:08.111
We were thinking
more like four.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.651
--Larry.

26:10.750 --> 26:12.399
Come on, this is free money.

26:12.450 --> 26:14.691
You're not renting
this place out for the month.

26:14.750 --> 26:16.900
-All right. Six.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.861
-It's gotta be four.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.320
-Five.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.406
-My man here says four.

26:26.870 --> 26:27.859
All right.

26:29.080 --> 26:30.320
-Larry!

26:33.160 --> 26:35.037
Thank you, sir.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.149
All right, y'all.

26:38.160 --> 26:40.321
Let's turn this bitch out.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.240
-So why GenCoin?

26:56.450 --> 26:58.441
-Cryptocurrency is
the next thing, right?

26:58.500 --> 26:59.569
-Meaning?

26:59.620 --> 27:01.156
-If I can go back in time

27:01.200 --> 27:03.156
and try to own
a piece of Internet, you know?

27:03.200 --> 27:04.360
-So, you're doing it
for the money?

27:04.410 --> 27:07.117
-Aren't you?
-No.

27:09.580 --> 27:12.322
-How computer savvy are you?
-Oh, I'm pretty savvy.

27:12.370 --> 27:13.576
-Rea|ly?
-Pretty savvy, yeah.

27:13.660 --> 27:14.570
-Fantastic.
-Yeah.

27:19.870 --> 27:21.531
-Uh, what are--
do you have any coding skills?

27:21.620 --> 27:23.281
-"Code"? What?
-Coding.

27:23.330 --> 27:24.991
-"Coding."
-Do you code at all?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.615
-Your folks rich?
-Sorry?

27:36.660 --> 27:38.571
-You come from money?
Do they got money?

27:38.620 --> 27:40.030
-I--
-What's your daddy do?

27:40.080 --> 27:41.536
-He's a neurosurgeon.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.906
-Give me money.

27:44.950 --> 27:46.941
-I thought this
was an interview.

27:55.500 --> 27:58.651
l
Its, um, um...

27:58.660 --> 28:00.241
-Is it kinda like PayPal?

28:00.330 --> 28:02.821
-Um, yes, yes.

28:02.830 --> 28:04.491
-Oh boy! I love PayPal!

28:08.500 --> 28:10.149
-I've been coding
since I was eight.

28:10.250 --> 28:12.821
Built my own rigs
and developed my own software.

28:12.830 --> 28:15.321
-Because you can.
-Right. Because I can.

28:18.540 --> 28:19.939
-Can you start tomorrow?

28:20.000 --> 28:21.900
-Yes, ma'am.
-Don't call me that.

28:29.870 --> 28:32.191
Come on, bit-boy,
pump it!

28:32.250 --> 28:34.821
-That's that feel I like.

28:34.870 --> 28:37.077
It's good.
I think it's good.

28:40.250 --> 28:42.491
- GenCoin.
- That's what's up.

28:45.330 --> 28:46.820
A few nibbles,
but nothing concrete.

28:46.870 --> 28:49.111
-No word from Blush yet?
-No.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.650
Sooner or later,
he's gonna call,

28:50.700 --> 28:51.826
asking where his money is.

28:52.950 --> 28:54.281
-Tell him.

28:54.330 --> 28:56.286
-Say what?
-We lost all his money?

28:56.330 --> 28:57.945
-No.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.615
This is the point.

28:59.660 --> 29:01.616
We show him
his money doing good.

29:01.660 --> 29:03.150
This office.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.532
The youngbloods
we got working for us.

29:05.580 --> 29:07.821
If he thinks we're legit,
all good.

29:07.870 --> 29:09.246
And then...

29:10.290 --> 29:11.860
we ask him
to double down.

29:11.910 --> 29:12.945
No.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.615
That's--
-That's a brilliant idea.

29:14.660 --> 29:15.900
-That's actually
a Ponzi scheme.

29:15.950 --> 29:17.156
-That's how they do, bro.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.656
-Well, that, it might
be how it is,

29:18.660 --> 29:20.366
how Bernie Madoff does,
but we're not gonna do that.

29:20.410 --> 29:21.741
-That's a brilliant idea.

29:21.830 --> 29:23.570
-Look, I know you lookin'
to pussyfoot around Blush,

29:23.660 --> 29:25.867
but it could take weeks
to set up more investments.

29:25.950 --> 29:28.111
And here's what's up.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.787
I got a gun
to my head, y'all.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.900
The dogs are circling my house,

29:32.950 --> 29:34.326
where my kids at.

29:34.410 --> 29:37.493
And pretty soon,
that hammer gonna drop.

29:37.580 --> 29:39.650
And when it do...

29:39.660 --> 29:41.901
if they don't get
their 300 from me...

29:43.200 --> 29:44.906
they comin' for you.

29:45.950 --> 29:46.939
And you.

29:49.370 --> 29:50.940
-Oh, man.

29:52.830 --> 29:55.492
You know, what you're proposing
is highly, highly illegal.

29:55.540 --> 29:58.156
-Nick, you done lost
a million and a half,

29:58.200 --> 30:00.031
and you didn't tell
your investor.

30:00.080 --> 30:02.150
You didn't tell your investor
'cause you started this thing

30:02.200 --> 30:04.077
with stolen drug money.

30:04.160 --> 30:07.618
And now...
you worried about illegal?

30:29.040 --> 30:31.110
-Hi, you've reached
Benedict Blush.

30:31.160 --> 30:32.787
Leave me a message,
and I'll get back to you.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.037
--Fuck.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.860
-Have a good day, baby girl.

34:05.330 --> 34:06.740
Bye, Dad.

34:11.200 --> 34:12.656
-Hey, Ronnie.
What dey do?

34:12.660 --> 34:14.150
Where you headed?

34:14.160 --> 34:16.151
-You need something, bro?

34:16.200 --> 34:19.158
-I just comin' through to see
what's good with Touie.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.321
-Touie at school, bruh.

34:29.830 --> 34:31.741
-Fo' sho. Fo' sho.

34:31.790 --> 34:32.779
Fo' sho.

35:03.500 --> 35:04.944
-Looks legit, huh?

35:10.580 --> 35:13.287
"Some just to sit there
lookin' fine," huh?

35:15.830 --> 35:17.786
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:17.830 --> 35:19.866
I'm Ben Blush,

35:19.910 --> 35:21.491
and I have a 9:00 appointment.

35:21.540 --> 35:22.780
-Yes.

35:22.830 --> 35:24.570
-Where's Nick?

35:26.450 --> 35:27.690
That's...

35:31.080 --> 35:32.195
-Damn.

35:33.250 --> 35:34.740
Ain't this some shit.

35:34.830 --> 35:36.491
-I can't do this.
I'm sorry.

35:36.540 --> 35:38.747
I'm not gonna do this.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.820
-It's too late, bruh.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.194
He's sitting
at the front right now

35:45.290 --> 35:47.656
staring at that sex doll
you hired.

35:48.790 --> 35:49.939
A'ight?

35:51.500 --> 35:53.786
What we're doing is fraud.

35:53.830 --> 35:56.697
Nick, my nigga,
you in this now.

35:57.700 --> 35:59.998
You been in this.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.615
It can't get no worse.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.076
-Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

36:06.120 --> 36:07.326
-Yeah.

36:08.370 --> 36:09.689
It is.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.445
All right, now stand up, man,
and be a man.

36:11.500 --> 36:12.694
-I need to brush my teeth.

36:12.750 --> 36:14.035
This is a selfie.

36:14.080 --> 36:15.991
- Yeah.
- And I--

36:16.040 --> 36:17.826
Benny!

36:17.830 --> 36:19.240
Good to see you, pal.

36:19.330 --> 36:20.900
-Hey, Nick.
Good to see you.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.649
-Benedict.
-Muah!

36:22.700 --> 36:24.656
-How are you?
-Yeah.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.827
Hey, cool space
you picked out here.

36:26.830 --> 36:28.695
You know,
very, uh, hipster.

36:28.790 --> 36:29.996
-Mm-hmm.
-That's exactly what it is.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.490
That's exactly what
we're going for.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.320
-You got that, uh,
sort of, uh...

36:33.330 --> 36:34.945
"try to look like
I don't care" feel.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.399
That's what's cool
in the valley.

36:36.450 --> 36:38.327
-And, uh, oh,
some pretty faces, too.

36:38.370 --> 36:39.576
Oh, yeah.

36:39.620 --> 36:41.611
-I think I know
who picked out that one, yeah?

36:41.660 --> 36:43.366
I have no--

36:43.410 --> 36:45.901
Believe it or not, Izzy.

36:45.950 --> 36:47.440
- Oh, yeah?
- She fought for her.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.320
- Yeah, whatever.
- Yeah?

36:51.040 --> 36:52.746
Yeah.

36:52.790 --> 36:54.690
- So.
- So...

36:54.750 --> 36:56.741
-What did you want
to discuss?

36:56.830 --> 36:58.650
Um, what we've been doing

36:58.660 --> 37:00.992
is inviting some
of our big investors

37:01.000 --> 37:03.491
to come on down and take
a tour of the offices

37:03.540 --> 37:07.499
and, uh, going over
monthly projections.

37:07.540 --> 37:09.610
-You wanted to see
ifI would double down.

37:11.830 --> 37:15.243
Same thing happens
with every startup
I've invested in.

37:15.290 --> 37:18.612
They'll have me come in
and hope that I'll fall

37:18.660 --> 37:21.151
for their dog and pony,
and then in the end,

37:21.200 --> 37:23.111
I'll either be
excited enough

37:23.160 --> 37:26.243
or dumb enough
to re-up.

37:26.290 --> 37:27.245
-Right.

37:28.410 --> 37:31.868
-I think it's admirable,
your generation.

37:31.910 --> 37:34.151
You know, some people
call it "entitlement."

37:34.200 --> 37:36.282
I like to think
of it as...

37:36.330 --> 37:38.400
tenacity.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.070
You know what, Benny?

37:40.160 --> 37:42.321
We ain't gonna bullshit
you no more.

37:42.330 --> 37:45.822
That is 100% why
Nick called you in here today.

37:45.870 --> 37:47.155
-Mm.

37:47.200 --> 37:51.648
-And we did have a whole dog
and whatever lined up.

37:51.700 --> 37:54.498
You know, Izzy was gonna
ride in on a white tiger,

37:54.500 --> 37:56.491
but the Animal Rights
Association wanted

37:56.500 --> 37:58.991
a whole ton of cash
to look the other way,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.150
so we scratched that idea
like, you know...

38:01.250 --> 38:02.945
-Wait, wait, wait,
that doesn't mean that

38:03.000 --> 38:05.366
the fireworks show
and the dancing girls
is off, does it?

38:05.410 --> 38:06.900
- No, no, for sure that's on.

38:06.950 --> 38:08.781
-You can't return that.
There are no refunds.

38:08.830 --> 38:10.866
- No refund policy.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

38:10.910 --> 38:13.447
-Hey, but on the real, though,
we just trying to blow

38:13.500 --> 38:14.990
this whole thing out quick.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.031
-Mm-hmm.
-You know, we want to stay
ahead of the competition.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.241
Absolutely. As you
are well aware,

38:19.330 --> 38:20.570
RadCoin launches
in a month.

38:20.660 --> 38:23.367
-Mm-hmm. Sure.
-And isn't it you that said,

38:23.410 --> 38:28.359
"Doesn't matter who's best,
only matters who's first"?

38:28.450 --> 38:30.611
-Yes, it was me
who said that.

38:30.660 --> 38:32.537
Yeah. Also, um...

38:32.620 --> 38:36.158
we've got our whole marketing
PR strategy ready to go,
ready to implement.

38:36.250 --> 38:39.071
We just need to
make our second milestone
to pay for it.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.781
So...

38:40.830 --> 38:42.149
who else is on board?

38:43.370 --> 38:44.689
- Um-—
Investors.

38:44.750 --> 38:46.490
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-I mean, when you guys
came to me,

38:46.540 --> 38:47.905
you had nothing.

38:47.950 --> 38:49.747
And now, huh, so quickly.

38:49.790 --> 38:52.361
I mean, you must
have roped in a couple
of heavy hitters here, huh?

38:52.410 --> 38:53.946
Mm-hmm.
- Who are they?

38:54.000 --> 38:56.571
-Uh...
-You-- you know that

38:56.620 --> 38:58.326
it's not prudent
at this juncture

38:58.370 --> 38:59.940
to reveal the names
of the other investors.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.399
We try to keep that--
-Correct.

39:01.500 --> 39:02.899
Correct. We're keeping
it very private.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.365
-I think I have
a right to know.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.696
I mean, especially since
you're asking me to re-up.

39:06.750 --> 39:09.366
Yeah. I mean, we have
a broad overview,

39:09.450 --> 39:11.657
but we don't share
investor info here.

39:11.700 --> 39:14.498
We can show you
our liquidity,

39:14.540 --> 39:16.940
- our budget, our projections...
- Yeah, yeah.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.399
-I set it all up for you.

39:18.450 --> 39:21.157
-I-- look, I mean,
as far as I know,

39:21.250 --> 39:22.899
you could be
bringing me in here

39:22.950 --> 39:25.362
because I am literally
the only investor

39:25.410 --> 39:27.287
you have right now.

39:27.330 --> 39:30.288
And it wouldn't be
a sound deCI5ion

39:30.330 --> 39:32.366
to re-up if that were the case,
now would it?

39:32.410 --> 39:33.570
- No.
- No, it wouldn't.

39:33.620 --> 39:34.609
You know what, Blush?

39:34.660 --> 39:36.287
I'mma get you some names.

39:36.330 --> 39:37.900
I'mma call up some
of the other investors,

39:37.950 --> 39:39.781
make sure it's cool that
we disclose their names to you.

39:39.830 --> 39:42.492
-I'm also gonna need
some proof of funds
from your bank.

39:42.540 --> 39:44.861
-Mm-hmm. Sure.
Why-- why is that?

39:44.910 --> 39:46.150
-Well, I want
to make sure that

39:46.160 --> 39:48.151
my money isn't getting
lonely, you know?

39:48.200 --> 39:49.827
-Fair enough, fair enough.
We can do that.

39:49.830 --> 39:51.149
Maybe give us, uh--

39:51.160 --> 39:52.866
we'll probably get that
for ya end of the week?

39:52.950 --> 39:55.157
-No, I'd like it right now.

39:58.790 --> 40:01.577
-I don't know
if we have it that handy.

40:01.620 --> 40:03.941
Uh, Izzy, can we do that?

40:04.000 --> 40:05.649
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The business manager has it,

40:05.660 --> 40:07.446
but she--
she's not here today.

40:07.500 --> 40:09.036
-Ah. Well...

40:10.410 --> 40:12.787
I'm sure my lawyers can
sort all this out.

40:12.830 --> 40:13.865
-Yeah.

40:13.910 --> 40:15.821
-I think I'm gonna
have him drop by.

40:15.870 --> 40:16.939
- do it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.740
Just have him--
have him stop by

40:18.790 --> 40:20.781
whenever you want,
and we'll everything
ready for you, bruh.

40:20.830 --> 40:21.945
We'll get it prepared.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.490
Hey, Ben, great--
great to see ya.

40:23.540 --> 40:24.859
-Hey, Megan, show Blush out.

40:30.830 --> 40:33.993
-Okay, all three of us,
we're going to prison
for a very long time.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.439
-Shut up.
-We're not going to prison.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.536
-We're definitely going
to prison. He knows.

40:37.620 --> 40:40.282
-He doesn't "know" know. He--
-He most definitely knows.

40:40.330 --> 40:41.900
And when he comes
with his lawyers,

40:41.950 --> 40:43.110
that's game over.

40:43.160 --> 40:44.400
He wanted to see
proof of funds!

40:44.450 --> 40:46.111
-Okay, we just have her
fake up some documents.

40:46.160 --> 40:48.492
-Oh, my god! Stop!
That's making it worse.

40:48.540 --> 40:50.531
-You got a better idea, Nick?
-No, I don't.

40:50.580 --> 40:52.491
-We gotta get him that money.

40:52.540 --> 40:53.689
Jesus.

40:53.750 --> 40:54.990
-What day is it today?

40:55.040 --> 40:56.075
What?

40:56.120 --> 40:58.361
-I-- it's Tuesday.

40:58.410 --> 40:59.536
-Shit!

40:59.580 --> 41:00.615
I have an idea.

41:00.660 --> 41:02.321
- Is it a good one?
- Maybe!

41:13.160 --> 41:15.151
- Oh, no

41:15.200 --> 41:17.111
Oh, Noelle

41:17.160 --> 41:20.539
There ain't no light
at the end of the tunnel

41:20.620 --> 41:23.828
Oh, oh,
don't you know

41:23.830 --> 41:27.402
There ain't no gold
at the end of the rainbow?

41:27.450 --> 41:28.940
Oh, no

41:29.000 --> 41:30.740
Oh, no, Noelle

41:30.790 --> 41:34.533
There ain't no light
at the end of the tunnel

41:34.580 --> 41:37.652
Oh, oh,
don't you know

41:37.700 --> 41:40.032
There ain't no gold

41:40.080 --> 41:43.288
If you wanna be Queen Bee

41:45.410 --> 41:49.824
Oh, then you better
start hustling

41:49.870 --> 41:52.998
Noelle, you gotta
make the gold

41:53.000 --> 41:55.867
At the end
of the rainbow
