I'm not gonna fight you
on this anymore, Chuck.

00:04.571 --> 00:06.276
If you trust her, then,

00:06.277 --> 00:08.177

00:08.217 --> 00:10.790
<i>Your father never wanted you</i>

00:16.338 --> 00:18.238
Flash! Come on!

00:18.276 --> 00:20.679
Sarah, my mom did something
to me with that device.

00:20.748 --> 00:22.648
Your mom gave us a wut.

00:22.684 --> 00:25.957
<i>Sarah, I can't flash.</i>
<i>The Intersect is gone.</i>

00:28.428 --> 00:31.096
We're in a real mess,
Agent Bartowski.

00:31.164 --> 00:34.301
Your trust in Agent Frost
proved a colossal error.

00:34.369 --> 00:37.506
I know I screwed up, General,
and if she weren't my mom,

00:37.574 --> 00:39.343
I would have shown
much better judgment.

00:39.344 --> 00:42.215
Which is why you haven't
been ejected from the Agency.

00:42.283 --> 00:44.953
But Agent Frost
is extremely dangerous.

00:45.021 --> 00:48.359
She and Alexei Volkoff are now
top priorities for capture.

00:48.427 --> 00:52.666
Agent Walker, Interpol reported
a sighting of them in Istanbul.

00:52.734 --> 00:54.634
Move out immediately.

00:55.873 --> 00:57.742
What about me,
General?

00:57.743 --> 00:59.578
Until the Intersect is working,

00:59.579 --> 01:00.613
you're Chuck's shadow.

01:00.614 --> 01:03.150
In Burbank.

01:06.891 --> 01:10.362
Um, so, General, I'm sorry, but

01:10.429 --> 01:12.198
are you saying
that the Intersect can,

01:12.199 --> 01:13.433
in fact, be fixed?

01:13.434 --> 01:14.869
Our scientists think

01:14.870 --> 01:17.339
your mother used a suppression
device to disarm the Intersect,

01:17.407 --> 01:18.942
for which there could
be countermeasures.

01:18.943 --> 01:20.310
So it's only been suppressed?

01:20.311 --> 01:22.580
It's not gone, like gone gone?

01:22.648 --> 01:26.253
I'm not a scientist, Chuck,
but you're about to meet a lot.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.220
You can ask them.

01:30.526 --> 01:32.562
This is pretty snug, isn't it?

01:32.629 --> 01:35.633
The Intersect is an implanted
collection of memories.

01:35.700 --> 01:38.671
A suppression device
hides those memories

01:38.738 --> 01:42.209
under what you might call
a... psychological rock.

01:42.277 --> 01:45.046
We need to find that rock
and remove it.

No-ski. Bartowski, no interest.

03:45.486 --> 03:46.653
And you knew that.

03:46.654 --> 03:48.122
I must be worse off

03:48.123 --> 03:49.522
I don't know why.

I wish I had good news.

It's itchy.

04:49.073 --> 04:50.440
Literally, it itches.

04:50.441 --> 04:51.774
Right. Um, look,
all the scientists

04:51.775 --> 04:53.609
who were checking me out-
they hit a wall,

04:53.610 --> 04:55.211
but they're sending a specialist
in from Langley.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.412
He should be here any minute.

04:56.413 --> 04:58.614
He'd better be good.
Casey,

04:58.682 --> 05:00.149
nobody wants to put the team
back together

05:00.150 --> 05:01.450
and back on missions
more than me.

05:01.451 --> 05:02.618
You got to know that.

05:02.619 --> 05:04.519
Hmm.

05:05.421 --> 05:07.488

05:14.695 --> 05:17.362

No, I'm serious.

05:17.430 --> 05:19.330
I'm worried about the guy, okay?
I was talking to Alex.

05:19.332 --> 05:21.232
Apparently, he went over there
to help her move some furniture,

05:21.233 --> 05:23.167
and he just stood there, staring
at her fish tank for an hour,

05:23.234 --> 05:24.435

06:45.098 --> 06:47.265
Well, I don't believe
that the psychological rock

can be hoisted off the Intersect

06:49.068 --> 06:50.668

play with yarn.

06:50.669 --> 06:52.036
Hmm.

06:54.472 --> 06:57.006
psychological, painful...

06:57.074 --> 06:59.775
brutal.

06:59.843 --> 07:02.277
Brutal? Can't wait
to get started.

07:02.345 --> 07:05.347
Chuck, if you're serious
about restoring the Intersect,

the end of this process,

08:11.131 --> 08:14.267
Largey small. I don't
know. It's... Oh!

08:15.168 --> 08:16.201
What was that for?

08:16.202 --> 08:17.936
We're starting
with pain therapy.

08:17.937 --> 08:21.239

it's a boulder,

he's hitting you.

be it fear, pain, anxiety,

What the hell is going on?

12:45.494 --> 12:46.727
Did you flash?

12:46.728 --> 12:47.862
Yes or no?

12:47.863 --> 12:49.363
What are you doing
in our bedroom?

12:49.364 --> 12:51.465
Chuck, since our pain
experiments failed at Castle-

12:51.532 --> 12:52.866
your fault, not mine-

12:52.867 --> 12:56.736
I think the key to restarting
the Intersect is fear.

12:56.804 --> 12:59.472
What are you doing
in our home?

12:59.540 --> 13:00.640
Castle's a safety zone.

13:00.641 --> 13:02.942
Apparently, this
place is, too.

13:03.009 --> 13:05.110
Chuck feels
protected by you.

13:05.178 --> 13:07.179
We need to up the ante again.

13:07.247 --> 13:09.147
PFOD.

13:09.181 --> 13:10.615
PF...

13:10.616 --> 13:12.083
Pfod?

13:12.084 --> 13:13.484
Pure fear of death.

13:13.485 --> 13:15.986
We need uncut, pure
adrenalized fear

13:16.054 --> 13:18.355
rocketing through your
plasma right now.

13:18.422 --> 13:21.991
This was close. But, hey,
that could be the cure.

13:22.059 --> 13:23.959
Huh.

13:28.999 --> 13:30.899
Holy- oh.

13:30.934 --> 13:32.334
Oh, you scared me

13:32.335 --> 13:33.602
half to death.

13:33.603 --> 13:35.403
Two civilian employees
have been watching me.

13:35.404 --> 13:37.538
I'm getting
annoyed by this.

13:37.606 --> 13:40.041
I have a way of dealing
with annoying things.

13:40.109 --> 13:41.409
It's pleasant.

13:41.410 --> 13:42.543
But only for me.

13:42.544 --> 13:44.478
Oh, I see.

13:44.545 --> 13:48.281
And, uh, can you tell me
which two civilians might, uh...

13:48.349 --> 13:50.549
might that be?

13:56.255 --> 13:58.489
Why'd I even bother?

13:58.557 --> 14:00.057
Of course.
I will keep an eye on them.

14:00.058 --> 14:02.393
Thank you.

14:05.629 --> 14:07.529
Go home.

14:07.731 --> 14:08.731
Go home.
You go home!

14:08.732 --> 14:10.899
Get out of here.
This way.

14:10.967 --> 14:13.902
General, Chuck can't go on
a mission without the Intersect.

14:13.970 --> 14:15.337
That's insane.

14:15.338 --> 14:17.372
As well as being
an expert psy-ops operative

14:17.439 --> 14:19.307
and Neurological PhD,

14:19.308 --> 14:21.709
Agent Rye is a fully trained
field operative.

14:21.777 --> 14:23.010
If he thinks the Intersect

14:23.011 --> 14:24.544
will be restored
by taking Chuck on a mission,

14:24.545 --> 14:26.646
that's where he's going.

14:26.714 --> 14:28.281
And a mission just hit
our radar, Agent Rye.

14:28.282 --> 14:29.548
I think it fits your bill.

14:29.549 --> 14:31.417
Is it dangerous?
Incredibly.

14:31.418 --> 14:33.151
Chance of violence?
It's guaranteed.

14:33.152 --> 14:34.186
Great!

14:34.187 --> 14:36.087
This is not great.
This is crazy!

14:36.088 --> 14:38.356
Agent Walker, this
is what Chuck wants.

14:38.424 --> 14:40.324
Right, Chuck?

14:41.826 --> 14:43.760
Whatever it takes to get
the Intersect back, General.

14:43.828 --> 14:46.630
Chuck and Agent Rye
will be going to a chalet

14:46.697 --> 14:47.998
in Gstaad, Switzerland,

14:47.999 --> 14:50.200
for the auction
of a 100-carat diamond,

14:50.267 --> 14:52.068
the "Cane Volto."

14:52.069 --> 14:53.336
Our intelligence indicates

14:53.337 --> 14:54.837
that leaders
of numerous criminal

14:54.838 --> 14:55.971
and terrorist organizations

14:55.972 --> 14:58.006
plan to attend the auction.

14:58.074 --> 14:59.907
This stone
is more than it seems.

14:59.908 --> 15:01.309
Method for money laundering,

15:01.310 --> 15:03.110
payment for illegal weapons,
that sort of thing.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.978
Yeah, we've done this before.
Thanks.

15:04.979 --> 15:06.179
Whoa.

15:06.180 --> 15:08.381
Chuck, your job is
to win the auction

15:08.449 --> 15:11.684
and bring the stone
back to the U.S.

15:11.752 --> 15:14.253
A room full
of underworld killers.

15:14.321 --> 15:15.888
Sounds great, right?

15:15.889 --> 15:16.922
General,
I assume that Casey and I

15:16.923 --> 15:17.990
will be there as a backup?

15:17.991 --> 15:19.758
No. No.

15:19.759 --> 15:22.427
With them in Gstaad, Chuck
will never reach maximum fear.

15:22.494 --> 15:25.562
Walker, you and Casey will
monitor the mission from Castle.

15:25.630 --> 15:26.996
What?

15:26.997 --> 15:29.265
Chuck is going alone
with Agent Rye?

15:29.333 --> 15:30.699
Sarah, the only way
I'll be able to flash

15:30.700 --> 15:31.867
is if there's no safety net.

15:31.868 --> 15:34.436
Yes, Chuck, but then
there's no safety net.

15:35.838 --> 15:37.706
We got a plane to catch.

15:37.707 --> 15:39.707
Let's move out.

15:41.377 --> 15:43.378
Wish me luck?

15:43.445 --> 15:45.345
Chuck, don't.

15:46.181 --> 15:48.882
Don't be a hero.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.984
Just come home safe to me, okay?

16:10.583 --> 16:12.450
Quite a tableau.

16:12.451 --> 16:15.286
Sometimes...

16:15.354 --> 16:18.622
scenery makes me cry.

16:20.091 --> 16:22.558
Isn't it amazing being a spy?

16:22.626 --> 16:26.295
I wish Sarah was here.

16:26.363 --> 16:30.332
Not in, uh, an official
capacity, of course.

16:32.335 --> 16:34.635
The only way in or out
of the chalet is the gondola.

16:34.703 --> 16:37.070
Things go south,
we're trapped.

16:37.138 --> 16:40.006
You'll produce enough
adrenalized fear to lift a car,

16:40.074 --> 16:41.941
let alone restart
the Intersect.

16:41.942 --> 16:43.842
You ready for
this, Chuck?

16:46.477 --> 16:48.377
He's a big boy, Walker.

16:48.412 --> 16:50.779
Yeah, Chuck's never been on a
mission without the Intersect.

16:50.847 --> 16:52.747
Tell me, honestly,

16:52.815 --> 16:53.982
if things go wrong,
do you think

16:53.983 --> 16:55.951
that he can
handle himself?

16:56.019 --> 16:57.519
I don't know.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.220
But I know he'll try.

16:59.221 --> 17:00.955
Which is exactly
what worries me.

17:00.956 --> 17:03.257
I'm just gonna check in again.

17:03.324 --> 17:06.025
For the sixth time.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.493
Hey, Sarah.

17:08.494 --> 17:09.528
SARAH
Chuck, are you there yet?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.429
Yeah, we're here.

17:11.431 --> 17:15.467
Sarah,
Switzerland is amazing.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.801
I mean, other than the fact
that this place is populated

17:17.869 --> 17:20.570
with a crowd
of international psychopaths,

17:20.637 --> 17:23.205
the air is so fresh

17:23.273 --> 17:25.441
and the chocolate? So milky.

17:25.509 --> 17:27.076
Uh, Chuck, listen, listen.

17:27.077 --> 17:29.511
If you get cornered and
you still can't flash,

17:29.578 --> 17:31.980
just don't do anything crazy.

17:32.047 --> 17:33.748
Don't worry. Everything's
going to be just fine.

17:33.749 --> 17:36.917
I'll talk to
you soon, okay?

17:36.984 --> 17:39.919
Hey, are you sure I
don't need a disguise?

17:39.987 --> 17:41.387
Hmm.

17:41.388 --> 17:43.489
Someone could
recognize you as CIA.

17:43.556 --> 17:45.423
Come after you with a knife.

17:45.424 --> 17:46.925
That would be great!

17:46.926 --> 17:48.926
Huh.

17:58.769 --> 18:00.236
The seller.

18:00.237 --> 18:01.470
Adelbert De Smet.

18:01.471 --> 18:04.539
Better known as
"The Belgian."

18:04.607 --> 18:07.241
Huh. I bet I know
how he likes his waffles.

18:08.576 --> 18:10.612
Belgian! Yes!

18:10.679 --> 18:14.081
Yes! I love your humor.
So disarming.

18:15.884 --> 18:18.219
De Smet is known
for industrial espionage,

18:18.286 --> 18:20.721
not precious gems.
Which is another reason

18:20.789 --> 18:22.289
this auction seems odd.

18:22.290 --> 18:24.724
Aside from the crowd.

18:24.792 --> 18:28.927
We've got underworld players
from Russia, Serbia, Montenegro.

18:28.995 --> 18:31.496
Wow. You really know
your Euro baddies, don't you?

18:31.564 --> 18:33.531
Focus, Chuck.
When you win the bidding,

18:33.599 --> 18:35.166
your competition's
not going to be happy.

18:35.167 --> 18:37.134
If you're lucky,
they'll follow you

18:37.202 --> 18:39.670
and try and kill you.

18:39.738 --> 18:41.838
Fingers crossed.

18:41.906 --> 18:44.073
Good luck.
Wait, wait. You're...

18:44.141 --> 18:46.309
You're-you're going?
I'm alone on this?

18:46.376 --> 18:48.577
It's your best chance to flash.

18:48.645 --> 18:50.712
Okay.

18:50.780 --> 18:52.714
The Cane Volto diamond.

18:52.782 --> 18:56.417
Very rare, 100 carats,

18:56.485 --> 19:00.220
D- colored, internally flawless.

19:00.288 --> 19:03.489
Bidding starts
at 25 million Swiss francs.

19:03.557 --> 19:05.124
Do I see 30 million?

19:05.125 --> 19:06.425
30 million.

19:06.426 --> 19:08.327
Do I see 40?

19:08.395 --> 19:10.630
40. Do I see 50?

19:10.697 --> 19:12.731
Sir, you're
already the high bidder.

19:12.799 --> 19:14.699
Do I see...

19:14.967 --> 19:17.235
50? 60?

19:17.302 --> 19:19.103
Sixty million
Swiss francs?

19:19.104 --> 19:22.172
Bid again,
get bullet in back.

19:22.239 --> 19:23.939
Holding at 50, then.

19:23.940 --> 19:25.407
Don't turn.
50 million going once.

19:25.408 --> 19:26.775
Okay, you know what?
Nice try, Rye.

19:26.776 --> 19:28.276
But I'm not falling for it.

19:28.277 --> 19:29.644
Going twice.
60 million Swiss francs.

19:29.645 --> 19:31.378
60 million.

19:31.379 --> 19:32.646
I'm not afraid
of your phony Russian accent

19:32.647 --> 19:34.047
or your finger-gun, okay?

19:34.048 --> 19:35.215
Bid again and die.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.884
Do I hear 65?

19:37.952 --> 19:39.485
Ooh, let's get crazy.

19:39.486 --> 19:40.954
80 million Swiss francs.

19:40.955 --> 19:42.189
80 million
to bidder number three.

19:42.190 --> 19:43.457
Oh, look at that. I didn't die.

19:43.458 --> 19:45.225
What a shocker.
Do I hear 85?

19:45.226 --> 19:46.526
Look, stop fooling around, okay?

19:46.527 --> 19:47.660
We got a job to do.

19:47.661 --> 19:49.561
Do not bid.

19:51.463 --> 19:53.932
80 then, going once.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.900
100 million Swiss francs.

19:56.637 --> 19:58.204
100 million,

19:58.205 --> 20:00.105
ladies and gentlemen.

20:00.141 --> 20:02.041
Going once.

20:02.677 --> 20:04.944
Twice.

20:05.012 --> 20:06.912
Sold.
You can go.

20:14.554 --> 20:15.887
I blew it.

20:15.888 --> 20:17.088
You absolutely blew it.

20:17.089 --> 20:18.989
And no flash, huh?

20:19.189 --> 20:20.687
Have you had this chocolate?

20:20.688 --> 20:22.253
Yes. It's so milky.

20:22.254 --> 20:23.620
It's so good.

20:23.621 --> 20:25.321
I thought that Russian would
get your blood pumping.

20:25.322 --> 20:27.022
I honestly thought
it was you.

20:27.023 --> 20:29.091
The Russian? It was
such a horrible accent.

20:29.159 --> 20:30.359
It sounded so phony.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.726
What kind of a spy am I?

20:31.727 --> 20:33.528
I cant' even be
scared properly.

20:33.529 --> 20:35.397
But-but listen.
I- I had a thought.

20:35.398 --> 20:38.833
Who carries 100 million Swiss
francs on them? Nobody, right?

20:38.901 --> 20:40.735
So that means the diamond
is going to be here

20:40.736 --> 20:42.203
until the money's
transferred to The Belgian.

20:42.204 --> 20:44.938
Until then, we can at least
get a better look at the thing.

20:45.006 --> 20:46.974
You're good, Chuck.

20:47.041 --> 20:48.775
Genius minds think alike.

20:48.776 --> 20:50.977
But I say we do more
than just look at it.

20:51.045 --> 20:53.046
Let's steal it.

21:03.490 --> 21:05.724
You all know
this new Greta.

21:05.792 --> 21:07.893
She's beautiful, yes.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.261
And efficient, sure.

21:09.262 --> 21:12.063
But why all
the suspicious behavior?

21:12.131 --> 21:13.765
We are forming
a fact-finding mob,

21:13.766 --> 21:16.400
and we want you,
my friends, involved.

21:16.468 --> 21:18.202
We are calling it...

21:18.203 --> 21:21.004
"Operation Get a Greta."

21:21.072 --> 21:23.473
The main objective
is to root out

21:23.541 --> 21:25.876
why such a nefarious individual
is working here

21:25.944 --> 21:27.778
at the Buy More.

21:27.779 --> 21:29.812
Oh, crap.
They're on to Greta.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.247
What do we do?

21:31.248 --> 21:33.015
We tell Greta.
She'll handle it.

21:33.016 --> 21:35.151
Right, right, right.
She'll... Wait a minute.

21:35.218 --> 21:36.418
What do you mean,
she'll handle it?

21:36.419 --> 21:37.419
Okay? Hey! Hey! Hey!

21:37.420 --> 21:39.454
Who-who is she?

21:39.522 --> 21:40.722
Assassin.

21:40.723 --> 21:42.290
Wait, no, she'll chop 'em up

21:42.291 --> 21:43.557
into a bunch of little pieces.

21:43.558 --> 21:45.425
Are you kidding me?
I mean, these are our...

21:45.426 --> 21:46.426
sort of friends.

21:46.427 --> 21:48.695
Colleagues?
Mm.

21:48.763 --> 21:50.530
No, huh? Doesn't matter.
No assassins, okay?

21:50.531 --> 21:52.431
You and I,
we have to handle this.

21:52.466 --> 21:54.333
<i>We</i> don't have to do anything.

21:54.334 --> 21:56.135
You're on your own.
Come on,

21:56.136 --> 21:59.504
I thought we were a team,
you and I- a damn good one.

21:59.572 --> 22:02.173
The team is DOA without
the Intersect working.

22:02.241 --> 22:04.775
So why protect something
that's going up in smoke, hm?

22:04.843 --> 22:06.710
You want to waste time
with these idiots,

22:06.711 --> 22:08.611
you're on your own.

22:13.317 --> 22:15.151
Hey, Chuck.
Hold on a second.

22:15.152 --> 22:17.553
Do you happen
to have the time?

22:19.622 --> 22:20.722
That was amazing.

22:20.723 --> 22:22.290
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

22:22.291 --> 22:23.825
<i>Star Trek.</i>

22:23.826 --> 22:25.293
<i>Star Trek,</i> really?

22:25.294 --> 22:27.361
No, not really.
Bangladesh.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.263
Meditative trancing.

22:29.264 --> 22:31.397
The secret is
mind over matter.

22:32.700 --> 22:34.333
But I love the show.

22:34.334 --> 22:36.234
Well, who doesn't?

22:39.538 --> 22:41.438
There's nothing in here.

22:44.776 --> 22:48.044
All right, well, what are
we supposed to do now?

22:48.112 --> 22:49.946
Now you flash.

22:49.947 --> 22:51.681
How can I flash?

22:51.682 --> 22:53.049
I don't exactly fear death.

22:53.050 --> 22:54.850
Security measures will activate

22:54.851 --> 22:56.718
in four... three...

22:56.719 --> 22:58.619
two... one.
Security measures?

23:06.194 --> 23:07.995
I've heard
of this kind of thing!

23:07.996 --> 23:11.797
The temp drops about
150 degrees in 30 seconds!

23:11.865 --> 23:14.133
So unless you want
to become a Chucksicle,

23:14.200 --> 23:16.101
I suggest you flash!

23:30.391 --> 23:32.826
It's not happening!

23:32.894 --> 23:34.060
Concentrate!

23:34.061 --> 23:36.463
Feel the fear
lifting the rock!

23:36.530 --> 23:38.198
No flash, no flash.

23:38.199 --> 23:40.133
Maybe Sarah can help us!

23:40.200 --> 23:41.834
Yeah, Sarah can help us!

23:41.835 --> 23:43.335
I got no service.

23:43.336 --> 23:44.903
What are we gonna do?

23:44.904 --> 23:46.536
My-my-my-my teeth are freezing.

23:46.537 --> 23:48.437
Chuck, can you flash?

23:48.472 --> 23:50.773
It's not happening.

23:53.276 --> 23:55.110
How about now?

23:55.111 --> 23:57.512
N- N-N-N-N-Nothing.

23:58.948 --> 24:00.848
How about now?

24:01.082 --> 24:04.084
All right, move out of the way.

24:15.260 --> 24:17.029
I honestly thought
you would flash.

24:17.030 --> 24:20.432
You knew the combination
this whole time?

24:20.499 --> 24:21.900
We have a mission
to complete.

24:21.901 --> 24:24.001
I came prepared.

24:30.407 --> 24:33.042
But I honestly wasn't
prepared for <i>this.</i>

24:33.110 --> 24:35.010
There's more than one diamond.

24:35.045 --> 24:36.345
What's going on?

24:36.346 --> 24:39.214
This has got to be worth
billions of dollars.

24:39.281 --> 24:41.015
Well, they can't
just be diamonds.

24:41.016 --> 24:43.617
On all my missions, it's
never just been diamonds.

24:43.685 --> 24:44.885
Yeah, you're right.

24:44.886 --> 24:46.786
They're working some angle.

24:49.123 --> 24:51.992
Yeah, well... when I heard
the mission was diamond-related,

24:52.060 --> 24:53.860
I took the liberty of grabbing

24:53.861 --> 24:56.129
a loop out of
the Castle's supply closet.

24:56.197 --> 24:58.164
Plus, I took
an online gemology class

24:58.232 --> 25:00.633
on the flight over here-
it was very convenient.

25:00.701 --> 25:02.034
Just like I thought- fake.

25:02.035 --> 25:03.402
It's made out of glass,

25:03.403 --> 25:05.636
but there's something
embedded inside.

25:05.704 --> 25:08.006
A microdot.

25:08.073 --> 25:10.208
Replace it with our phony.

25:13.278 --> 25:15.178
This is a fake, too.

25:16.080 --> 25:17.247
Great work, Bartowski.

25:17.248 --> 25:19.715
Now we got to figure out
what the story is

25:19.782 --> 25:21.682
on these phony diamonds.

25:24.420 --> 25:26.353
<i>Rye, I don't understand.</i>

25:26.421 --> 25:27.955
I don't know
what the problem is.

25:27.956 --> 25:30.023
A minute ago, I was
truly fearing for my life.

25:30.090 --> 25:31.824
Why isn't this working?
We need to explore

25:31.825 --> 25:34.159
a more sophisticated
level of fear therapy.

25:34.227 --> 25:38.397
The psychological rock has
keyed on to a deeper anxiety.

25:38.464 --> 25:40.166
A person...

25:40.167 --> 25:41.667
a relationship.

25:41.668 --> 25:42.734
With whom?

25:42.735 --> 25:45.036
Huh? What did... you...

25:46.372 --> 25:47.805
With her.

25:47.806 --> 25:49.706
♪ ♪

25:57.715 --> 26:01.550
Well, this has been...
a quiet lunch.

26:01.618 --> 26:04.853
Uh, I should let you
get back to your books.

26:04.921 --> 26:06.821
And you back to work.

26:06.823 --> 26:08.923
How is that going,
by the way?

26:08.991 --> 26:11.124
What have you heard?

26:11.192 --> 26:13.093
Just what Morgan's told me.

26:13.160 --> 26:16.328
That he's about ready
to have an intervention on you.

26:16.396 --> 26:18.597
Look, we both know
you haven't been

26:18.665 --> 26:20.634
on a mission in a while,

26:20.701 --> 26:22.604
but I think there's
a little more to this

26:22.672 --> 26:26.107
than just an
itchy trigger finger.

26:26.175 --> 26:27.975
What gives?

26:27.976 --> 26:30.543
♪ ♪

26:31.911 --> 26:34.078
I'm preparing myself
psychologically...

26:34.146 --> 26:37.347
in case I get sent back
to Afghanistan or Iraq.

26:37.415 --> 26:39.382
Mm, I got soft.

26:39.449 --> 26:41.349
I made friends here.

26:42.452 --> 26:44.354
Well, you know Morgan's scared

26:44.422 --> 26:47.056
of the team being
broken up, too, and...

26:47.124 --> 26:49.926
if you are transferred,
which might not even happen,

26:49.994 --> 26:53.195
don't you think it'd be better
to be nice to your friends

26:53.263 --> 26:55.796
than... drive them away?

26:55.864 --> 26:58.633
That's just a thought.

27:10.543 --> 27:11.843
Hey, fellas.

27:11.844 --> 27:13.177
Hey.

27:13.178 --> 27:14.478
What are you doing?
You all right?

27:14.479 --> 27:15.979
Yeah.
Can you tell me what this is?

27:15.980 --> 27:17.714
Not a lure
for the new Greta.

27:17.715 --> 27:20.085
Okay, do me a favor,
you need to back off

27:20.152 --> 27:22.054
this Greta thing, okay,
for your own good.

27:22.122 --> 27:23.388
The operation
is underway, Grimes,

27:23.389 --> 27:24.989
you can't stop this pit bull.

27:24.990 --> 27:26.723
He's got a taste
for meat.

27:26.724 --> 27:28.359
You want to know who's
gonna be meat? You guys.

27:28.360 --> 27:29.760
You don't scare us.
Yeah.

27:29.761 --> 27:31.995
We won't be stopped,
and we can't be stopped,

27:32.063 --> 27:35.265
and we won't be stopped.

27:35.332 --> 27:37.333
LESTER
I think I see her.

27:44.908 --> 27:46.208
Hi, now! Wow.

27:46.209 --> 27:47.610
Sorry, you have
to stop doing that,

27:47.611 --> 27:48.811
because I have a bad ticker.

27:48.812 --> 27:50.780
This is absolutely
the last straw.

27:50.848 --> 27:52.582
They put a webcam
in my locker,

27:52.583 --> 27:53.850
they bugged my price gun,

27:53.851 --> 27:56.018
the psychotic one follows
me with a video camera

27:56.086 --> 27:58.221
narrating the tracking
and hunt of the Greta marmot.

27:58.288 --> 27:59.689
What does that even mean?

27:59.690 --> 28:01.857
Which one do you think is
the psychotic one?

28:01.925 --> 28:03.758
Doesn't matter?

28:03.759 --> 28:06.794
Never mind. If they discover my
identity, it'll breach national security,

28:06.862 --> 28:09.496
and a CIA facility
would be at risk.

28:09.564 --> 28:11.665
It's time
to neutralize the risk.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.500
Whoa, hold on, hold on
a second, please, please.

28:13.501 --> 28:14.801
They don't know anything, okay?

28:14.802 --> 28:17.869
Trust me, they have the
mental capacity of field mice.

28:17.937 --> 28:21.773
They bother me again,
they meet my favorite friend.

28:24.076 --> 28:25.577
Understood.

28:25.578 --> 28:29.180
I'm magnifying the microdot.

28:29.248 --> 28:31.349
God only knows what's on it,

28:31.417 --> 28:34.283
but it can't be good.

28:34.350 --> 28:35.583
We'll start the analysis

28:35.584 --> 28:37.818
and send it back
to the team at Castle.

28:39.254 --> 28:41.322
Do you really think that Sarah

28:41.389 --> 28:44.391
is the emotional rock
sitting on the Intersect?

28:44.459 --> 28:46.226
Why do you always call for her
right before you flash?

28:46.227 --> 28:48.428
You did it in the bedroom
<i>and</i> in the vault.

28:48.495 --> 28:50.529
Yeah, well, you know, I was...
Scared.

28:50.597 --> 28:52.431
Perfectly normal...

28:52.432 --> 28:54.365
for a nerd herder.

28:54.433 --> 28:57.702
But a spy, Chuck,
handles his fear on his own.

28:57.769 --> 28:59.069
Or her own.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.537
Ask yourself
a question.

29:00.538 --> 29:01.705
Are you a spy...

29:01.706 --> 29:03.874
or are you a guy
with a spy girlfriend?

29:04.909 --> 29:06.876
I'm a spy.

29:06.944 --> 29:08.844
The microdot is
heavily encrypted,

29:08.845 --> 29:11.314
but it appears to contain
a series of photographs

29:11.381 --> 29:13.082
and blueprints for CIA assets.

29:13.083 --> 29:14.550
The Belgian's
selling our intel

29:14.551 --> 29:16.285
to the highest bidder.

29:16.286 --> 29:18.687
And there are 20 other
fake diamonds just like it.

29:18.755 --> 29:21.590
Colonel Casey, Agent Walker,
finish decoding the intel.

29:21.658 --> 29:23.092
Bartowski and Rye,

29:23.093 --> 29:25.594
capture The Belgian
and recover the fake stones.

29:25.662 --> 29:27.830
Until we know what's
really on those microdots,

29:27.898 --> 29:30.899
this is code red
and could likely get very ugly.

29:30.967 --> 29:32.400
General, at this point
I feel it's essential

29:32.401 --> 29:34.169
that I go with Chuck
and Agent Rye to Switzerland.

29:34.170 --> 29:36.571
Um, I think Sarah
should let <i>us</i> handle this,

29:36.639 --> 29:39.040
seeing as how we've determined
this is the only way

29:39.107 --> 29:40.807
I will get the Intersect
back working.

29:40.808 --> 29:42.709
Chuck, we're talking
about real danger now.

29:42.776 --> 29:44.577
I'm sorry, and I can
only handle fake danger?

29:44.578 --> 29:46.078
Look, I-I know
the Intersect is important,

29:46.079 --> 29:48.214
but so far none of Agent Rye's
therapies have worked,

29:48.281 --> 29:50.181
and the microdot contains
highly sensitive information

29:50.183 --> 29:52.451
that the wrong people
will kill for.

29:52.519 --> 29:54.119
Well, I can take care
of these wrong people

29:54.120 --> 29:55.253
without you holding my hand.

29:55.254 --> 29:57.388
Why does it make sense
to risk your life?

29:57.456 --> 29:58.956
Because it's what I do-
I'm a spy.

29:58.957 --> 30:00.857
No, Chuck, you're not.

30:07.397 --> 30:09.164
Not right now.

30:09.165 --> 30:14.101
The mission is best accomplished
with the proper manpower.

30:14.169 --> 30:16.603
Agent Walker, get to Gstaad.

30:20.275 --> 30:22.876
A supersonic jet will have me
there in there in five hours.

30:22.944 --> 30:24.043
We'll talk then, okay?

30:24.044 --> 30:26.045
I'm sorry, Chuck.

30:26.113 --> 30:28.513
I just can't let you
risk your own life.

30:41.230 --> 30:44.932
Greta to the cage, please.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.434
Greta, to the cage.

30:49.103 --> 30:52.002
A delicious, though complicated
foot-long Subway-

30:52.070 --> 30:54.637
Black Forest Ham

30:54.705 --> 30:57.439
on honey oat with chipotle
sauce... No, no, no, no.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.274
Guys, please,
what are you doing?

30:59.275 --> 31:01.642
banana peppers and jalapenos...
If she doesn't kill you, I will.

31:01.710 --> 31:07.147
has been found
with your name on it.

31:07.215 --> 31:09.716
So come to the cage.

31:11.919 --> 31:14.019
Now we wait.

31:18.890 --> 31:21.592
Oh, I see our little lure
worked, eh, Greta?

31:21.660 --> 31:24.461
If that is your name.

31:24.529 --> 31:27.198
Come, sit.

31:34.305 --> 31:36.205
What the hell
are you doing, moron?!

31:38.441 --> 31:40.341
Listen to me.

31:44.079 --> 31:47.013
We can do this the hard way,
or we can do this...

31:47.081 --> 31:50.083
the way that's...

31:50.150 --> 31:53.218
very difficult.

31:53.286 --> 31:55.520
Whoa, whoa, stop, guys.
Greta, guys-

31:55.588 --> 31:57.055
quit this now.

31:57.056 --> 31:58.523
No. You know what?
I've had it.

31:58.524 --> 32:00.158
This stops here and now!

32:00.159 --> 32:02.359
Now who are you, Greta?!
And what do you know?!

32:04.228 --> 32:05.662
Okay, there it is.

32:05.663 --> 32:07.764
There it is. We are prepared
for the knife eventuality.

32:07.832 --> 32:09.766
Jeffrey, please disarm her.

32:16.805 --> 32:18.705
Whoa, mama!

32:20.074 --> 32:21.174
The only question is:

32:21.175 --> 32:23.210
Do you want to die
with your wig on or off?

32:23.277 --> 32:25.945
Are you talking about my hair?

32:26.013 --> 32:27.413
All right, wait, wait,
now, hold on.

32:27.414 --> 32:28.680
Whatever you're thinking
about doing, do not do it.

32:28.681 --> 32:31.449
Okay? It is not worth
it. Stand down! Now!

32:31.517 --> 32:33.718
Stand down.

32:35.587 --> 32:38.121
What is going on here?

32:41.592 --> 32:45.427
Her locker was full
of credit card slips,

32:45.495 --> 32:47.896
and she was making off
with the head massagers.

32:47.964 --> 32:50.765
She's been sneaking around
because she's a thief.

32:50.833 --> 32:52.500
Swine!

32:52.501 --> 32:55.302
How could you do that to me
after I trusted you?

32:55.370 --> 32:56.570
Let's go.
Let's go.

32:56.571 --> 32:57.771
Come on.
Thank you.

32:57.772 --> 32:58.972
Oh, well done.

32:58.973 --> 33:00.707
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

33:00.708 --> 33:02.641
Okay, you're going
downtown.

33:02.709 --> 33:04.442
Thief?

33:04.443 --> 33:06.878
How does a thief disappear
into thin air?

33:06.946 --> 33:08.713
Well, there's an old walkway

33:08.714 --> 33:11.148
behind the walls in the HTR
for electrical repairs.

33:11.216 --> 33:13.316
Should have been boarded up
after the fire, but

33:13.384 --> 33:14.818
she found it.

33:14.819 --> 33:18.254
Why did she transmogrify
into a woodland creature?

33:18.322 --> 33:20.455
Shh.
Why does she have a tail?

33:21.691 --> 33:23.425
Consider that ignored.

33:23.426 --> 33:24.960
You fellas did a great job.

33:24.961 --> 33:27.595
Buy More thanks you.

33:27.663 --> 33:29.729
That was intense.

33:29.797 --> 33:31.731
We caught a thief!

33:31.799 --> 33:33.732
And...

33:33.800 --> 33:36.434
I need a change
of trousers.

33:38.037 --> 33:40.338
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Chuck.

33:40.406 --> 33:43.340
I think we got
a visitor. Yup.

33:43.408 --> 33:45.508
The Belgian just
entered the vault.

33:47.878 --> 33:48.878
There's no microdot!

33:48.879 --> 33:51.179
Well, uh,
evidently, we, uh,

33:51.247 --> 33:53.248
had a security breach.

33:53.315 --> 33:56.450
Get surveillance footage
of the vault and the hallway

33:56.518 --> 33:57.684
and meet me at
the gondola.

33:57.685 --> 33:58.852
But the Russian buyer?

33:58.853 --> 34:01.220
No time for that.
Pack up the diamonds.

34:01.288 --> 34:02.521
We're leaving now!

34:02.522 --> 34:04.422
Gondola.

34:04.457 --> 34:06.392
Perfect.
Enclosed space.

34:06.459 --> 34:08.359
No escape.

34:08.393 --> 34:11.295
We'll arrest them there. Uh,
Sarah's plane's almost here.

34:11.362 --> 34:14.097
Well, we can wait
for her and lose him,

34:14.165 --> 34:16.668
or... go be heroes.

34:19.670 --> 34:21.637
Let's be heroes.

34:21.705 --> 34:23.039
Attaboy!

34:23.040 --> 34:25.040
Yeah!

34:37.385 --> 34:39.185
Hey, it's Chuck.
You know what to do.

34:39.186 --> 34:40.920
Hey, it's me again.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.487
Why aren't you getting my calls?

34:42.487 --> 34:43.822
Call me, okay?

34:43.822 --> 34:45.822
I love you.

34:48.327 --> 34:50.762
Colonel Casey,

34:50.830 --> 34:52.864
I've admired your work
for years,

34:52.931 --> 34:55.331
but this outpost

34:55.400 --> 34:57.300
and its personnel

34:57.368 --> 34:59.335
are unprofessional.

34:59.403 --> 35:01.303
And I'm disappointed in you.

35:02.339 --> 35:04.239
Listen, Agent Greta,

35:04.274 --> 35:06.174
I don't know who
you've worked with before,

35:06.242 --> 35:07.709
or what crew you were on.

35:07.710 --> 35:10.645
This is the best damn
spy team in the world.

35:10.712 --> 35:12.046
We are strong.

35:12.047 --> 35:13.380
So do us a favor.

35:13.381 --> 35:15.281
Don't let the door hit you
in the ass.

35:26.190 --> 35:27.857
We are strong, aren't we?

35:27.858 --> 35:29.391
Mm.

35:29.392 --> 35:31.693
Yeah, even if we are
missing a-a few pieces.

35:31.761 --> 35:34.896
And see, doesn't it feel better
being part of a team,

35:34.964 --> 35:37.366
than always suffering alone?

35:37.434 --> 35:39.369
Right. I always forget
the no-touch thing.

35:39.436 --> 35:41.336
Point taken.

35:41.872 --> 35:44.339
Oh, man.
Speaking of missing pieces.

35:46.542 --> 35:49.177
Casey, why is Chuck
on that monitor?

35:49.245 --> 35:51.579
This isn't good.

35:53.415 --> 35:55.282
Hey.

35:55.283 --> 35:56.449
Chuck's on the microdot.

35:56.450 --> 35:57.783
Belgian knows
he's the Intersect.

35:57.784 --> 35:59.684
What?!

36:03.356 --> 36:06.924
Come on, Chuck,
pick up the phone.

36:08.894 --> 36:10.127
Hey.
Chuck.

36:10.128 --> 36:12.496
Hey, Sarah. Are you
okay? Where are you?

36:12.564 --> 36:14.732
We're on the gondola
about to arrest The Belgian.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.000
If anything happens,
I know I'll flash.

36:16.001 --> 36:17.001
Chuck, listen, The Belgian

36:17.002 --> 36:18.168
knows exactly...

36:18.169 --> 36:19.502
Agent Walker, we can
handle it from here.

36:19.503 --> 36:21.304
No! Wait!

36:21.305 --> 36:23.273
All right,
follow my lead.

36:23.340 --> 36:25.508
And if we get into real
trouble, you'll get us out of it.

36:25.576 --> 36:27.276
You don't need Sarah.

36:27.277 --> 36:29.710
This is all you.

36:31.945 --> 36:33.679
Last chance, Chuck.

36:33.680 --> 36:35.580
On or off?

36:38.950 --> 36:41.417
On.

36:51.548 --> 36:54.083
Adelbert De Smet,

36:54.150 --> 36:56.050
you're coming with us.

36:58.019 --> 36:59.386
No, no.

36:59.387 --> 37:02.287
No, Agent Carmichael's
coming with me.

37:02.355 --> 37:04.022
The asset in your head is

37:04.023 --> 37:06.224
worth far more
than the entire list

37:06.292 --> 37:08.058
embedded in these microchips.

37:08.059 --> 37:11.260
Surrender... or die.

37:11.328 --> 37:12.928
They know I'm the Intersect.

37:12.929 --> 37:14.563
Scared?

37:14.564 --> 37:16.464
Me, too.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.838
Drop your weapon!

37:21.906 --> 37:23.840
No tether, no Sarah.

37:23.908 --> 37:26.043
We're in it up
to our chins.

37:29.547 --> 37:30.715
How you
feeling, Chuck?

37:30.716 --> 37:31.749
Not great, not great.

37:31.750 --> 37:32.916
Honestly, I sort
of flashed,

37:32.917 --> 37:34.117
but I'm not sure.

37:34.118 --> 37:36.018
All right, well...
let's find out!

37:43.726 --> 37:45.626
Oh!

37:53.700 --> 37:55.600
Rye!

37:58.638 --> 38:00.372
200 feet to the rocks below!

38:00.373 --> 38:02.340
Talk about some serious
danger, huh, Chuck?

38:02.407 --> 38:03.941
Hold on a second.

38:03.942 --> 38:05.842
Oh!

38:09.450 --> 38:10.917
Anything?

38:10.918 --> 38:12.218
No. No, nothing yet,

38:12.219 --> 38:13.785
and believe me,
I'm plenty terrified!

38:13.786 --> 38:14.953
Help me up!

38:14.954 --> 38:18.155
Sorry, Chuck, not gonna happen.

38:18.223 --> 38:20.390
What? What?
No. My hands are slipping.

38:20.458 --> 38:22.859
Rye, my hands are slipping.
I may actually die right now!

38:22.926 --> 38:25.061
Fantastic!
This is your final test.

38:25.128 --> 38:26.628
The wind's picking up.

38:26.629 --> 38:28.163
You're looking death
right in the face.

38:28.164 --> 38:30.498
The only thing that can
save you now is the Intersect.

38:30.566 --> 38:33.934
Focus, Chuck.
You can do this!

38:36.604 --> 38:37.770
No. This is crazy.

38:37.771 --> 38:39.171
It's not coming back.

38:39.172 --> 38:40.572
But you know the rock is Sarah.

38:40.573 --> 38:42.341
Tell yourself
you don't need her,

38:42.342 --> 38:44.242
and give in to the fear!

38:44.310 --> 38:45.476
But I do need her!

38:45.477 --> 38:47.378
I love her,
and I'd rather love Sarah

38:47.446 --> 38:48.612
than have the Intersect.

38:48.613 --> 38:50.113
Now help me up!

38:50.114 --> 38:52.782
CIA didn't send me out here
to affirm your love, Bartowski.

38:52.850 --> 38:54.917
You need the Intersect
up and running.

38:54.985 --> 38:57.019
Now, get that rock
off your chest

38:57.087 --> 38:58.987
and be a real spy like me!

39:01.790 --> 39:05.291
Did I just get... shot?

39:05.359 --> 39:07.093
No. No!

39:07.094 --> 39:09.395
I certainly did.

39:09.463 --> 39:11.363
No!

39:13.031 --> 39:14.931
Grab my hand or die!

39:16.269 --> 39:18.436
Come on!

39:26.243 --> 39:28.244
Chuck, what's going on?
Where are you?

39:28.311 --> 39:30.946
Pursue Agent Carmichael,
and we will kill him.

39:31.013 --> 39:32.647
Slowly.

39:32.648 --> 39:35.449
There will be
no further warning.

39:36.318 --> 39:38.218
No! Please wait!

39:42.823 --> 39:44.590
General, I want immediate
authorization to mobilize

39:44.591 --> 39:47.126
to Belgium and hunt down
this son of a bitch.

39:47.194 --> 39:49.528
Which I would grant
if there was indication

39:49.596 --> 39:50.996
De Smet was in Belgium,

39:50.997 --> 39:53.231
but there's no indication
of his whereabouts at all.

39:53.299 --> 39:54.566
They were at Gstaad Airport.

39:54.567 --> 39:56.534
I have a witness
who saw them board

39:56.602 --> 39:58.169
a private jet,
tail number CLM...

39:58.170 --> 39:59.904
CLM-one-two-one-one.

39:59.905 --> 40:01.305
I know, Agent Walker.

40:01.306 --> 40:02.873
Okay, the plane
didn't just disappear.

40:02.874 --> 40:04.475
It had to have landed somewhere.

40:04.476 --> 40:06.076
We put a code red out

40:06.077 --> 40:07.977
to every clandestine agency
on the planet.

40:07.979 --> 40:09.412
The moment
there's a sign of Chuck,

40:09.413 --> 40:11.414
we'll mobilize every resource.

40:11.481 --> 40:13.382
Colonel Casey,
you've got your mission.

40:13.450 --> 40:14.917
You're running point.

40:14.918 --> 40:16.251
And me?

40:16.252 --> 40:18.253
Sarah... he's out there.

40:18.321 --> 40:19.688
We'll find him.

40:19.689 --> 40:21.090
But until there's intel,

40:21.091 --> 40:23.091
go home and get some rest.

40:23.159 --> 40:25.128
You'll be informed
of any developments.

40:25.195 --> 40:26.595
I'm staying right here.

40:26.596 --> 40:27.863
You're going home.

40:27.864 --> 40:29.764
That's an order.

40:33.502 --> 40:35.135
Bartowski's smart.

40:35.136 --> 40:36.904
Intersect or no, he'll be fine.

40:36.905 --> 40:39.173
This is all my fault.

40:39.240 --> 40:43.310
He did this to prove to me
that he could be a spy.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.014
♪ ♪

41:18.376 --> 41:21.011
What do you want?

41:21.079 --> 41:22.979
I want the Intersect.

41:33.489 --> 41:35.790
What are you doing, Walker?

41:45.232 --> 41:47.166
I'm gonna go find Chuck.

41:47.234 --> 41:48.735
We'll go together.

41:48.736 --> 41:51.670
Wherever he is,
we will find him,

41:51.738 --> 41:53.172
and we'll bring him back.

41:53.173 --> 41:56.240
Thank you.

41:56.308 --> 41:58.876
I don't... I don't have it,
Mr. Belgian... De Smet.

41:58.943 --> 42:01.178
It's gone.

42:01.246 --> 42:02.712
I lost it.

42:02.713 --> 42:04.147
Please Agent Carmichael,

42:04.148 --> 42:05.648
don't take me for a fool.

42:05.649 --> 42:10.219
The less you resist,
the less painful this will be.
