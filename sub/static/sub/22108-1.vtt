00:28.182 --> 00:29.748
BOB: All right,

00:29.773 --> 00:31.807
breakfast is served. We
got some French toast,

00:31.842 --> 00:34.576
eggs in the hole,
bacon, and hash browns.

00:34.611 --> 00:37.479
(whistles) Is that it, Dad?
You're kind of phoning it in.

00:37.514 --> 00:39.648
Uh, what can I say? I
like making breakfast.

00:39.683 --> 00:41.817
He's got eggs, and he
knows how to use 'em.

00:41.852 --> 00:44.386
Oops, I dropped some egg.

00:44.421 --> 00:46.388
Oh, no. If only we had a dog,

00:46.423 --> 00:48.590
it would be cleaning
that up for us right now.

00:48.625 --> 00:51.259
Guys, we've been over this.
I know that puppy you saw

00:51.295 --> 00:53.106
- last week was cute, but...
- I beg your pardon.

00:53.130 --> 00:54.908
"Cute" is not a word that
even begins to describe

00:54.932 --> 00:57.099
- what that puppy was.
- He was like Shirley Temple

00:57.134 --> 00:58.734
stuffed inside a teddy bear

00:58.769 --> 01:01.069
stuffed inside that
kid from Jerry Maguire.

01:01.105 --> 01:02.755
(sighs) We can't have a dog.

01:02.780 --> 01:05.006
Dogs are expensive... The food, the vet,

01:05.042 --> 01:07.008
the Halloween costumes.

01:07.044 --> 01:10.317
Oh, also having a dog is a lot
of work, and you kids hate work.

01:10.342 --> 01:13.974
You never do any of your
chores. Y-You don't... floss.

01:13.999 --> 01:16.395
Yeah. Hey, weren't we gonna
start using a chore wheel?

01:16.420 --> 01:18.927
That's right. Whose chore was
it to make the chore wheel?

01:18.952 --> 01:19.638
- Not me.
- Not me.

01:19.663 --> 01:20.403
- Not me.
- Not me.

01:20.435 --> 01:23.465
Please, please, please
let us have a dog.

01:23.494 --> 01:25.026
KIDS: Please?

01:25.062 --> 01:26.495
Wow, that was good harmony.

01:26.530 --> 01:28.363
- But no.
- (kids groan)

01:28.399 --> 01:30.265
Okay, we didn't want to have to do this,

01:30.300 --> 01:32.559
but we drew some pictures
of the family. Gene?

01:32.584 --> 01:34.469
Here we are, dog-less.

01:34.505 --> 01:36.471
Note how gray and empty we all look.

01:36.507 --> 01:38.118
- LINDA: What am I holding?
- TINA: You've got a knife

01:38.142 --> 01:39.182
and you're gonna stab Dad.

01:39.209 --> 01:41.843
- Oh, yeah.
- And here we are with a dog.

01:41.879 --> 01:43.545
Ooh! I look good.

01:43.580 --> 01:45.447
Yup. The sun is shining.

01:45.482 --> 01:47.115
Look at the light. Look at the color.

01:47.151 --> 01:48.483
BOB: Um, who's the other woman?

01:48.519 --> 01:50.018
LOUISE: Mom let you get another wife.

01:50.053 --> 01:51.922
You met her when you
were out walking the dog.

01:51.947 --> 01:54.389
Her name is Susan. She's a homeopath.

01:54.425 --> 01:56.024
I like Susan.

01:56.059 --> 01:57.559
So, can we get a dog?

01:57.594 --> 01:59.828
- (Both) No.
- (sighs) Poor Susan.

01:59.863 --> 02:01.596
Now I'm afraid I'm gonna stab you.

02:03.288 --> 02:04.854
TINA: Wow, that's a long line.

02:04.889 --> 02:06.756
Yeah. What is going on over there?

02:06.791 --> 02:08.223
LINDA: Look. "Now serving brunch

02:08.258 --> 02:10.192
and all you can drink
Bloody Mary-naras."

02:10.228 --> 02:13.663
Hey, Bob. I-I see you got a huge
line outside your restaurant.

02:13.698 --> 02:16.032
(chuckles) Oh, wait, oh, that's me!

02:16.067 --> 02:17.366
(cackles) Zoom.

02:17.402 --> 02:18.734
Only we do.

02:18.770 --> 02:20.169
Oh that's very funny, Jimmy.

02:20.204 --> 02:21.860
Yeah, it's called brunch, Bob.

02:21.885 --> 02:22.938
Read about it.

02:22.974 --> 02:24.340
Why don't you read about it?

02:24.375 --> 02:26.175
- Yeah, here, read this.
- (farts)

02:26.210 --> 02:27.910
(both laugh)

02:27.945 --> 02:30.046
He's talking about his
butt. Like it's a book.

02:30.081 --> 02:32.348
- Hey, don't explain it.
- Just clarifying.

02:32.383 --> 02:34.717
I'm going inside now, so have fun.

02:34.752 --> 02:36.952
There's no line. You
should get right in.

02:36.988 --> 02:38.754
Stupid Jimmy Pesto.

02:38.790 --> 02:40.556
Do that many people really go to brunch?

02:40.591 --> 02:43.526
Yeah. Families, young people,
big groups of girlfriends

02:43.561 --> 02:45.261
who all just broke
off their engagements.

02:45.296 --> 02:47.596
Maybe we could do brunch.
We already serve food.

02:47.632 --> 02:50.032
Well, I do love cooking eggs.

02:50.068 --> 02:51.934
It could be fun.

02:51.969 --> 02:56.138
And so I said, "I don't
get hungry, I get fun-gry."

02:56.174 --> 03:00.276
Oh, honey, if you're
fun-gry, I'm fun-starving.

03:00.311 --> 03:02.411
- I like dating.
- Check, please.

03:02.447 --> 03:05.381
(laughter)

03:05.416 --> 03:07.750
Let's do it. But I get to be the Carrie.

03:07.785 --> 03:10.319
Mom, you're the Stanford
Blatch and you know it.

03:10.355 --> 03:12.054
Linda, you wouldn't
be going to the brunch,

03:12.090 --> 03:14.123
- you'd be working at it.
- Oh. Right.

03:14.158 --> 03:15.458
GENE: Sucks for you, Mom.

03:15.493 --> 03:17.560
Uh, you kids would be working, too.

03:17.595 --> 03:19.295
- Yay.
- Oh, we'd love to,

03:19.330 --> 03:21.263
but we have to go to church.

03:21.299 --> 03:23.065
But look at that line outside Jimmy's...

03:23.101 --> 03:25.134
- We could really use the money.
- For a dog.

03:25.169 --> 03:27.570
- No.
- Ooh, we could serve mimosas.

03:27.605 --> 03:29.905
But we could call 'em
Mom-osas, after me.

03:29.941 --> 03:32.575
Yeah. Or Gene-mosas,
after Gene Simmons.

03:32.610 --> 03:34.577
Okay, let's do it. Let's do a brunch.

03:34.612 --> 03:35.978
Good, yeah, this'll be great.

03:36.013 --> 03:37.747
Bob's Burgers' Brunch.

03:37.782 --> 03:41.083
We'll see who has a bigger
line tomorrow, Jimmy.

03:41.119 --> 03:42.184
Hello, Belchers.

03:42.220 --> 03:43.452
How are we today?

03:43.488 --> 03:45.020
Uh-uh, hi, Mr. Fischoeder.

03:45.056 --> 03:46.756
Ca... Uh, can we help
you with something?

03:46.791 --> 03:49.125
We-we sent you the rent.
It was very late, but...

03:49.160 --> 03:50.326
Right. Yes.

03:50.361 --> 03:52.595
- Uh, thank you.
- Do you...

03:52.630 --> 03:54.930
- want to see a menu?
- (chuckles): Oh, no.

03:54.966 --> 03:56.999
No. No, I do not want
to eat your food, Bob.

03:57.034 --> 03:59.034
I'm actually looking
for my brother, Felix.

03:59.070 --> 04:00.369
You haven't seen him, have you?

04:00.405 --> 04:01.804
No. How long has he been gone?

04:01.839 --> 04:03.472
Do you think he's okay?

04:03.508 --> 04:05.374
Oh, I'm sure he's
fine. Uh, it's just that

04:05.410 --> 04:07.877
"Crocodile Rock," uh, came
on the radio and I don't want,

04:07.912 --> 04:09.645
uh... I don't want him to miss it.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.047
I love that song. It's about
when The Rock was young.

04:12.083 --> 04:14.383
(clattering) -Ugh. Louise,
I asked you to take this out

04:14.419 --> 04:15.651
to the Dumpster last night.

04:15.686 --> 04:17.286
Oh, the Dumpster Dumpster.

04:17.321 --> 04:18.721
I thought you meant something else.

04:18.755 --> 04:20.055
(sighs) Go.

04:20.091 --> 04:21.656
- Now.
- Okay.

04:21.692 --> 04:23.959
See? See how much I love to work?

04:23.995 --> 04:26.162
I see. We still aren't getting a dog.

04:26.197 --> 04:28.197
I'll break you yet, Robert Belcher.

04:31.903 --> 04:33.869
- Felix?
- Shh! I'm hiding.

04:33.916 --> 04:36.082
Well, Mr. Fischoeder is
inside looking for you.

04:36.107 --> 04:37.573
What?! Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

04:37.608 --> 04:39.241
That's who I'm hiding from.

04:39.277 --> 04:41.177
- Why?
- I can't tell you, but let's just say

04:41.212 --> 04:44.135
that I'm in a lot of danger if
he finds me. Oh, did he already

04:44.160 --> 04:45.548
- look around in there?
- Yup.

04:45.583 --> 04:46.980
Then that's where I should hide.

04:47.005 --> 04:49.744
Now that he's looked in there,
that spot'll be good for hours.

04:49.769 --> 04:51.720
Hey, if I came back
later, could you let me in?

04:51.756 --> 04:53.722
- What's in it for me?
- What do you want?

04:53.758 --> 04:55.157
I want a lot of things, Felix.

04:55.193 --> 04:56.926
But right now I want money for a dog.

04:56.961 --> 04:58.928
- You owe a dog money?
- No. (sighs)

04:58.963 --> 05:01.030
What would you say to $250?

05:01.065 --> 05:03.165
- I'd take it.
- No, you pay me.

05:03.201 --> 05:05.147
- That's okay, too.
- All right, we'll hide you.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.602
Great. I'll be back later tonight.

05:06.637 --> 05:08.737
And one more thing... you
can't tell anyone you saw me.

05:08.773 --> 05:10.673
You have no idea what's at stake.

05:10.708 --> 05:13.275
Now, if you don't mind, I'd
like to finish my garbage fries.

05:13.311 --> 05:15.077
What did I do with my garbage ketchup?

05:15.112 --> 05:18.848
Hmm. I thought for sure I
would find him in this area.

05:18.883 --> 05:20.869
He always turns up in
the dirtiest places.

05:20.894 --> 05:22.084
W-Wait, what?

05:22.119 --> 05:24.220
Oh, did I say dirty? I meant... dingy.

05:24.255 --> 05:25.788
Louise, you still have the trash.

05:25.823 --> 05:28.724
Ha! I do. Crazy me. So forgetful.

05:28.759 --> 05:30.726
Hmm. You were out there
an awfully long time

05:30.761 --> 05:33.229
and yet you did not
throw the trash away.

05:33.264 --> 05:35.395
Talking to someone, were we?

05:35.420 --> 05:36.856
What? No.

05:36.881 --> 05:40.402
Bob, mind if I poke my head
in your alley, so to speak?

05:40.438 --> 05:43.239
(sniffs) He was here!

05:43.274 --> 05:45.207
- He was?
- Oh, yes.

05:45.243 --> 05:48.744
If he wasn't, then who
does this belong to?

05:48.779 --> 05:51.146
Wha... I don't see it.
W-What are you talking about?

05:51.189 --> 05:55.379
It's a hair. A single,
limp, blonde hair.

05:55.404 --> 05:57.119
A hair I'd know anywhere.

05:57.154 --> 06:00.055
That's crazy. We get all
kinds of blondes in this alley.

06:00.091 --> 06:02.024
We have to shoo them away with a broom.

06:02.994 --> 06:04.793
Well, this has been really fun

06:04.829 --> 06:06.395
and, uh, not weird at all,

06:06.430 --> 06:09.632
but we better get back
to our dingy lives.

06:09.667 --> 06:13.269
All right. Cheers, pink ears.

06:13.304 --> 06:15.437
What was that all about?
Are you two dating?

06:15.473 --> 06:18.974
No, but we are going to hide
his brother in our basement.

06:19.010 --> 06:21.310
Nice. I knew it was one or the other.

06:23.364 --> 06:25.538
Granny! That hurt my
sweet little fingers.

06:26.905 --> 06:28.972
Okay, your Dad and I
have to run a few errands

06:29.007 --> 06:31.892
- for brunch tomorrow.
- I'm making a topless burger

06:31.917 --> 06:33.550
with a fried egg and hollandaise

06:33.586 --> 06:35.686
that is really complicated, so...

06:35.721 --> 06:37.521
Wait, are you topless or the burger?

06:37.556 --> 06:39.556
- Hmm. We'll see.
- All right,

06:39.592 --> 06:40.991
bye, bye, bye. (kisses)

06:41.026 --> 06:42.693
- Stay out of my room!
- My room, too.

06:42.728 --> 06:44.027
Stay out of our room!

06:44.063 --> 06:46.463
- Okay, sister, spill.
- Spill what?

06:46.499 --> 06:48.031
Apparently, we're going to hide a man

06:48.067 --> 06:49.800
- in our basement?
- Go on.

06:49.835 --> 06:51.735
- Well, a Felix.
- Oh.

06:51.770 --> 06:53.437
Psst!

06:55.074 --> 06:57.207
Okay, so we brought you
down a blanket, a pillow...

06:57.243 --> 06:59.221
(mouth full): Some potato
chips. No, wait, never mind.

06:59.245 --> 07:01.578
Here's a DVD of Prelude to
a Kiss starring Meg Ryan.

07:01.614 --> 07:03.881
I mean, there's no DVD player down here

07:03.916 --> 07:05.816
and we lost the DVD that...

07:05.851 --> 07:07.896
Oh, don't worry. I've hidden
in much more boring places

07:07.920 --> 07:09.686
than this for much
longer than one night.

07:09.722 --> 07:12.422
I just need to stay hidden
until 12:30 p.m. tomorrow,

07:12.458 --> 07:13.690
and then I win.

07:13.726 --> 07:14.925
W-Wait. Win what?

07:14.960 --> 07:16.527
You said you were in danger,

07:16.562 --> 07:18.662
and I took advantage of that for money.

07:18.697 --> 07:20.831
In danger of not
winning hide-and-seek.

07:20.866 --> 07:22.566
We play every year on our birthdays.

07:22.601 --> 07:25.569
The birthday boy hides, and
the non-birthday boy seeks.

07:25.604 --> 07:26.837
- It's your birthday?
- Oh, no.

07:26.872 --> 07:28.839
My birthday was 19 days ago.

07:28.874 --> 07:30.507
You've been hiding for 19 days?

07:30.543 --> 07:31.942
- Smell me.
- (sniffs) Ugh.

07:31.977 --> 07:33.710
Huh. I'd say 15.

07:33.746 --> 07:36.349
And if I make it to 20, I
beat my brother's record.

07:36.374 --> 07:38.615
Why aren't you hiding
somewhere cool, like Europe?

07:38.651 --> 07:40.350
Or the Upside Down.

07:40.386 --> 07:42.564
Well, the rules are you have
to stay in town, you can't carry

07:42.588 --> 07:44.888
any money, and you can't kill
anyone to keep them quiet.

07:44.924 --> 07:46.790
Can you kill them
just to send a message?

07:46.825 --> 07:50.227
Wh-When you say "no money,"
we're still getting our $250

07:50.262 --> 07:52.229
of sweet, sweet dog cash, right?

07:52.264 --> 07:54.631
Yes. Keep me hidden
till 12:30 p.m. tomorrow,

07:54.667 --> 07:57.701
- and I'll make it $251.
- Whoa.

07:57.736 --> 08:01.271
But if Calvin finds me
before then, you get nothing.

08:01.307 --> 08:03.118
You really think Mom and
Dad will let us get a dog

08:03.142 --> 08:04.942
- if we have that money?
- Sure, that'll cover

08:04.977 --> 08:07.277
a couple months' expenses.
And then do you really think

08:07.313 --> 08:09.391
they'll want to give an
adorable little fur-ball back?

08:09.415 --> 08:12.049
I mean, they kept Tina, and
she can't even shake a paw.

08:12.084 --> 08:13.317
I'm working on it.

08:14.987 --> 08:16.720
BOB: Well, hello, eggs.

08:16.755 --> 08:19.957
"Hi!" You guys ready to be
in some amazing frittatas?

08:19.992 --> 08:21.625
"We sure are!"

08:21.660 --> 08:24.461
You guys seem pretty egg-cited.

08:24.496 --> 08:25.963
Get it? (laughs)

08:25.998 --> 08:28.465
"You're really funny!" Thank you.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.300
Hey, Bob, if you're
done talking to the eggs,

08:30.336 --> 08:32.068
come out here and take a look at this.

08:32.104 --> 08:33.636
Sorry, I have to go talk to my wife.

08:33.672 --> 08:34.905
"Run away with us, Bob."

08:34.940 --> 08:36.698
I can't. Well, maybe.

08:36.724 --> 08:37.774
W-We'll see.

08:37.809 --> 08:41.120
(hums) Is it great or what?
I even drew a

08:41.145 --> 08:43.647
- little champagne glass, you see?
- _

08:43.682 --> 08:45.482
Good morning, sleepy-beepies!

08:45.517 --> 08:47.584
Oh, hey, Mom and Dad.
How are you? Good morning.

08:47.620 --> 08:50.087
You guys sure got up early
and snuck out of the house.

08:50.122 --> 08:52.322
How's it going? Have you
been down in the basement?

08:52.358 --> 08:54.524
Um, yeah, of course we have. Why?

08:54.560 --> 08:56.126
Oh, cool. Very cool.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.427
How was it?

08:57.463 --> 08:58.629
It was the basement.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.119
What the hell is going on?

09:00.144 --> 09:02.666
(giggles nervously) Not
much. How are you doin'?

09:02.701 --> 09:04.501
Um, you guys are acting really weird.

09:04.536 --> 09:07.170
(laughs) You're acting really weird.

09:07.206 --> 09:09.521
Okay, well, can someone go get
me some tomatoes from the walk-in?

09:09.546 --> 09:10.700
- Me!
- On it!

09:10.725 --> 09:11.719
Yep!

09:11.744 --> 09:13.655
- What was that all about?
- Oh, it's probably all part

09:13.679 --> 09:15.212
- of this dog thing.
- Oh, right.

09:15.247 --> 09:16.880
We're never getting a dog, right?

09:16.915 --> 09:18.382
- No way.
- Okay, good.

09:18.417 --> 09:19.883
If anything, maybe a monkey.

09:19.918 --> 09:22.319
- Right. Wait, what?
- Monkey.

09:22.354 --> 09:25.489
Felix, it's us, Tina, Louise,
and Gene Belcher from upstairs.

09:25.524 --> 09:26.735
FELIX (muffled): I'm back here!

09:26.759 --> 09:28.492
(grunting)

09:28.527 --> 09:31.061
He's like a human Karma Chameleon.

09:31.096 --> 09:33.008
(winded): I had to tuck
myself in here this morning

09:33.032 --> 09:34.464
when your parents came down.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.500
But I had a nice head
of lettuce for breakfast,

09:36.535 --> 09:37.734
and I'm feeling okay.

09:37.770 --> 09:38.669
Aren't you cold?

09:38.704 --> 09:40.671
Yes! I think I might lose a toe.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.572
But it'll all be worth
it to see the look

09:42.608 --> 09:45.876
on Calvin's dumb, warm face
when I break his record.

09:45.911 --> 09:47.678
Okay, you need warmer clothes.

09:47.713 --> 09:50.547
We can get some, but we'll
have to distract Mom and Dad

09:50.582 --> 09:52.416
so they don't ask questions.

09:52.451 --> 09:55.218
We could say something like,
"Don't look in the basement.

09:55.254 --> 09:57.988
There's no man down there." Huh?

09:58.023 --> 10:00.223
Here are those tomatoes
you ordered, Father.

10:00.259 --> 10:02.893
And now we're going to just
pop upstairs for a second

10:02.928 --> 10:05.429
because we have a
little surprise for you.

10:05.464 --> 10:07.030
Good surprise or bad surprise?

10:07.066 --> 10:08.699
Eh, surprise me.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.200
Y'all ready for this?

10:10.235 --> 10:11.435
Introducing...

10:11.470 --> 10:13.603
(humming fanfare)

10:13.639 --> 10:15.576
- ... Brunchsquatch!
- (Gene humming)

10:15.601 --> 10:18.775
LINDA: Oh, my God, I
love it! Brunchsquatch!

10:18.811 --> 10:21.378
Aw! Cute little construction
paper bacon and eggs.

10:21.413 --> 10:24.081
- Bob, do you love it?
- Yeah, it's a good idea.

10:24.116 --> 10:26.583
We can send him outside
to drum up business.

10:26.618 --> 10:30.020
Okay, Brunchsquatch
distraction was a success.

10:30.055 --> 10:31.688
(grunting)

10:31.724 --> 10:33.423
- Little help?
- (grunting)

10:33.459 --> 10:35.859
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. In.

10:35.894 --> 10:38.028
Ooh, look, a line!
We're like a nightclub!

10:38.063 --> 10:39.696
Or an understaffed drugstore.

10:39.732 --> 10:41.698
That's great! In your face, Jimmy.

10:41.734 --> 10:43.767
Okay, quick meeting,
everybody. Gather round.

10:43.802 --> 10:44.938
Wh-Where's Louise?

10:44.962 --> 10:45.970
- Bathroom.
- Mexico.

10:45.971 --> 10:47.882
All right, well, when she's
back, she's running food.

10:47.906 --> 10:49.373
Linda, you greet 'em and seat 'em.

10:49.408 --> 10:51.208
Tina, you're on busing and water

10:51.243 --> 10:53.543
and picking up weird
stuff off the floor.

10:53.579 --> 10:54.911
How do I know if it's weird?

10:54.947 --> 10:56.747
Like that Band-Aid. Weird? Not weird?

10:56.782 --> 10:59.249
Gene, you go outside, do
your thing, and bring 'em in.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.785
I'll shake my little
benedicts! Bum, bum, bum!

11:01.820 --> 11:03.064
No, no, no. Don't
don't do that. Just...

11:03.097 --> 11:05.563
- No, no, no.
- Roar! I'm a little tiger!

11:05.591 --> 11:07.402
- Gene, don't do that. No, no.
- I'm a sexy little tiger.

11:07.426 --> 11:08.925
- Don't do that.
- Yeah!

11:08.961 --> 11:10.939
- Please, no. Just get customers.
- Shake, shake, shake.

11:10.963 --> 11:13.330
I'll be in the kitchen,
making the world's best brunch.

11:13.365 --> 11:15.098
On three. One, two...

11:15.134 --> 11:17.334
Okay, you're - you're opening the door.

11:17.369 --> 11:19.770
Hello! I'm Linda.
Welcome to Bob's Burg...

11:19.805 --> 11:21.171
- (singsongy): I'm here!
- Oh.

11:21.206 --> 11:23.273
Dame Judi Brunch, as
you live and breathe.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.442
Yes, it's really me.
Yes, I'm really here.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.344
Yes, let's really have brunch.

11:27.379 --> 11:30.180
(chuckles): I'm sorry. Dame
Who-Di-what? What is it?

11:30.215 --> 11:32.449
Wait. Oh, my God. This is adorable.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.784
You don't know who I am.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.419
I don't.

11:35.454 --> 11:37.421
She doesn't know who
I am. Okay, I love you.

11:37.456 --> 11:39.756
Um, okay, of course, this
is your first brunch day,

11:39.792 --> 11:41.925
so how could you? My
real name is Dalton,

11:41.960 --> 11:43.994
but I write a blog, Brunch Drunk Love,

11:44.029 --> 11:47.422
- under the name Dame Judi Brunch.
- Wow!

11:47.447 --> 11:49.633
And this is Jennifer,
other Jennifer, and Greg.

11:49.675 --> 11:51.875
- Hello.
- [IN UNISON] Hi.

11:51.904 --> 11:54.671
So you said you write a brunch
blog. I'd love to see that.

11:54.706 --> 11:57.874
How do I find it? Do I, uh...
I blog dot net or something?

11:57.910 --> 11:59.876
Or I just print it out? Or what do I do?

11:59.912 --> 12:02.045
(laughs): Oh, my God, so funny!

12:02.080 --> 12:04.147
Okay, now, what is that?
What am I looking at?

12:04.183 --> 12:06.516
- (grunting)
- That is my son. He's Brunchsquatch.

12:06.552 --> 12:07.784
Stop it. I'm dying.

12:07.820 --> 12:09.619
No, you stop it. Don't die.

12:09.655 --> 12:11.955
I won't. I'm dying. I won't stop.

12:11.990 --> 12:14.624
Okay, so, first things first,
bring us two mimosas each.

12:14.660 --> 12:16.660
And we'll look at the
menu. Never stop being you.

12:16.695 --> 12:19.463
Oh, my God, I can't believe
I just met a blogger.

12:19.498 --> 12:21.465
♪ ♪

12:21.500 --> 12:22.866
Wow, it's really filled up!

12:22.901 --> 12:24.779
We're having a buncha brunch!

12:24.804 --> 12:27.003
Linda, this orange juice
tastes a little off.

12:27.039 --> 12:28.516
Well, it's got champagne in it, Teddy.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.240
What? I had four of 'em!

12:30.275 --> 12:32.587
Well, why'd you drink so many
if you thought they tasted weird?

12:32.611 --> 12:35.212
- I wanted to fit in.
- Oh, you. Ooh, you want a little more?

12:35.247 --> 12:37.047
Maybe. Maybe half a glass.

12:37.082 --> 12:38.482
Linda, where are the orders?

12:38.517 --> 12:40.584
Well, no one's ordered food yet.

12:40.619 --> 12:42.719
They sure love the Mom-osas though, huh?

12:42.754 --> 12:44.823
- Louise, there you are.
- What? Nothing.

12:44.848 --> 12:46.990
O-Kay. Uh, go take some orders.

12:47.025 --> 12:49.226
These people need to have
food with their alcohol.

12:49.261 --> 12:50.309
You got it.

12:50.696 --> 12:52.262
- (bell jingles)
- (gasps)

12:52.297 --> 12:53.697
Oh, hello, little Belcher!

12:53.732 --> 12:55.532
Thought I'd stop by for brunch.

12:55.567 --> 12:58.969
I left something here yesterday,
and I've come back for him.

13:01.518 --> 13:03.634
Mr. Fischoeder, hello!

13:03.659 --> 13:05.362
Um, do you want brunch?

13:05.393 --> 13:08.027
Yes. One brunch, please, Linda.

13:08.062 --> 13:11.297
I've been searching for
brunch all over town,

13:11.332 --> 13:13.065
and I've come to believe it's here.

13:13.101 --> 13:15.835
It is... here.

13:15.870 --> 13:18.337
So, I'm gonna go get you a Mom-osa.

13:18.373 --> 13:20.339
- Get it? (chuckles)
- You get it.

13:20.375 --> 13:24.143
- (chuckling)
- (chuckling): I will, I will.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.379
So, child of Bob,

13:26.414 --> 13:30.850
where do you think that sneaky
little brunch might be hiding?

13:30.885 --> 13:34.720
Well, landlord of Bob, I don't
know what you're talking about.

13:34.756 --> 13:37.156
Am I drunk or are you guys
having a weird conversation?

13:37.191 --> 13:38.391
- Both.
- Both.

13:38.426 --> 13:39.825
So, some news.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.227
You're gonna want to stay put,

13:41.262 --> 13:42.828
because your brother is upstairs.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.930
- What?!
- It's okay.

13:44.966 --> 13:47.433
He's way up there, and
you're way down here.

13:47.468 --> 13:49.769
You don't understand!
He's like a bloodhound.

13:49.804 --> 13:51.337
And now I'm trapped.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.005
Geez. Calm down. Gah.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.408
I will take care of this.
Just stay here, stay warm,

13:55.443 --> 13:57.743
and, for God's sake, stop
eating all the lettuce.

13:57.779 --> 13:59.779
It's not even washed.

13:59.814 --> 14:01.747
"Why aren't more people
ordering us, Bob?"

14:01.783 --> 14:03.382
I-I have no idea, eggs.

14:03.418 --> 14:05.951
I mean, I'm sure they will v-very soon.

14:05.987 --> 14:08.521
- Order up. Tell your eggs.
- Okay. Here we go.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.521
One frittata for table five.

14:10.546 --> 14:11.791
Wait, there's, like, seven people

14:11.826 --> 14:13.995
crammed in that booth.
They just want one frittata?

14:14.020 --> 14:15.409
LINDA: Guess they aren't hungry.

14:15.434 --> 14:17.886
So far, the only person who
ordered a lot is The Dame.

14:17.911 --> 14:19.332
His table got one of everything.

14:19.387 --> 14:21.321
Wait. Why are you
calling him "The Dame"?

14:21.356 --> 14:23.923
He's Dame Judi Brunch and
he runs a blog about brunch.

14:23.959 --> 14:25.325
- Oh, cool.
- Back off. He's mine.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.993
I'll go ask him what we're doing wrong.

14:27.028 --> 14:28.840
Maybe we didn't make the right
kind of food or something.

14:28.864 --> 14:31.364
Shh, shh. Don't listen to her, eggs.

14:31.399 --> 14:34.000
You guys are perfect.
"We don't like her."

14:34.035 --> 14:36.803
She's just jealous of us. "We know."

14:36.838 --> 14:38.972
All right. We need to
figure out a way to get Felix

14:39.007 --> 14:40.952
out of the basement without
Mr. Fischoeder seeing him.

14:40.976 --> 14:42.275
This seems like what the phrase

14:42.310 --> 14:43.688
"Hey, look over there" was born for.

14:43.712 --> 14:45.178
Whew, I need to pee

14:45.213 --> 14:46.824
and I feel like I
shouldn't do it out there

14:46.848 --> 14:48.314
on the sidewalk... again.

14:48.350 --> 14:50.016
People did not like that.

14:50.051 --> 14:51.518
(gasps) Yes, Gene, that's it.

14:51.553 --> 14:52.986
You do need to pee.

14:53.021 --> 14:54.721
I love how excited you are about this.

14:54.756 --> 14:56.523
No, no, no, listen, listen. Come here.

14:56.558 --> 14:58.958
So, why did you agree
to hide Felix, Louise?

14:58.994 --> 15:01.494
- Did he offer to pay you?
- Did who offer to pay me?

15:01.530 --> 15:03.463
(quietly): And do you
want to pay me more?

15:03.490 --> 15:05.824
(laughs) No, I-I-I don't need to.

15:05.867 --> 15:08.701
My hide-and-seek record
has stood for 15 years.

15:08.737 --> 15:11.404
The closer it gets to 12:30,
the more fun it will be

15:11.439 --> 15:13.239
to see his face when I find him.

15:13.275 --> 15:16.175
- And I know exactly where he is.
- Oh, really?

15:16.211 --> 15:18.147
Yes. He's in the basement.

15:18.172 --> 15:20.213
What? That's crazy.

15:20.248 --> 15:21.848
(laughing nervously): Well, he's...

15:21.883 --> 15:24.183
And I'll be there, too, very soon.

15:24.219 --> 15:27.220
But for now, I'm going to sit
here, drink this terrible mimosa

15:27.255 --> 15:30.256
and let him think that he's
going to make it to 12:30.

15:30.292 --> 15:32.191
Well, I better go before
I embarrass myself.

15:32.227 --> 15:33.893
You know what? Maybe I'll just...

15:33.929 --> 15:35.595
So, Dame, how do you like your food?

15:35.630 --> 15:37.108
Where do we fall on the brunch-o-meter?

15:37.132 --> 15:39.399
How do I like this
brunch? How do I... ugh.

15:39.434 --> 15:42.268
- How can you even ask me that?
- Oh, I mean, uh...

15:42.304 --> 15:43.503
I don't like it.

15:43.538 --> 15:45.405
- I love it.
- You do?

15:45.440 --> 15:47.941
The Frittata Have
Faith? The Waffle Truth?

15:47.976 --> 15:50.109
I almost literally never say this word,

15:50.145 --> 15:53.179
- but this brunch is amazeballs.
- He says that all the time.

15:53.214 --> 15:54.881
- He never says that.
- Wait. What?

15:54.916 --> 15:58.084
Well, do you know why no one
else is ordering anything?

15:59.004 --> 16:00.967
(laughter)

16:01.780 --> 16:03.790
- Oh, no, Linda.
- Oh, no, what?

16:03.825 --> 16:07.527
Linda, please tell me you
have a meal-per-P-minimum?

16:07.562 --> 16:09.395
A PP what? A PP what?

16:09.431 --> 16:11.564
Okay, okay. If you read my
blog, you would know this.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.467
A meal per person minimum. Look around.

16:14.502 --> 16:16.436
You've got a restaurant
full of brunch skunks.

16:16.471 --> 16:18.237
Oh, no. Not brunch skunks!

16:18.273 --> 16:19.739
What are those? What are those?

16:19.774 --> 16:22.909
Oops. Ugh. We need new glasses!

16:22.944 --> 16:24.711
That is a brunch skunk, Linda.

16:24.746 --> 16:26.813
They're just here for
the bottomless mimosas.

16:26.848 --> 16:28.881
You didn't say they
each had to order a meal,

16:28.917 --> 16:31.618
so they've got empty stomachs,
and... (gasps) Oh, my God!

16:31.653 --> 16:33.419
Are these drinks not watered down?!

16:33.455 --> 16:36.255
Of course not. Who waters down a mimosa?

16:36.291 --> 16:38.558
First of all, I know.
But second, it's brunch.

16:38.593 --> 16:40.893
Okay? We went to that place
across the street yesterday.

16:40.929 --> 16:44.097
I had 16 Bloody Marys
and I wasn't even buzzed.

16:44.132 --> 16:45.395
- I had 20.
- She had 20.

16:45.419 --> 16:46.367
We all drove home.

16:46.368 --> 16:48.735
- Oh, my God.
- And once the skunks settle in,

16:48.770 --> 16:50.637
it's almost impossible to kick them out.

16:50.672 --> 16:52.271
They're like bedbugs.

16:52.307 --> 16:54.085
I've seen brunch skunks
throw up in their booths,

16:54.109 --> 16:55.308
and just keep drinking.

16:55.343 --> 16:56.809
I've seen a boy brunch skunk

16:56.845 --> 16:58.444
fight his way out of an ambulance

16:58.480 --> 17:00.524
to try to get back into a
restaurant for more drinks.

17:00.548 --> 17:01.914
This is bad, Linda.

17:01.950 --> 17:03.449
This is very bad.

17:03.485 --> 17:05.018
Oh, God. I got to go tell Bob!

17:05.053 --> 17:06.786
Yes, you do.

17:06.820 --> 17:08.699
But before you do that,
could you be a lil' cabbage

17:08.723 --> 17:10.757
and grab us another round
of Mom-osas and some more

17:10.791 --> 17:12.825
jalapeño aioli for our
burgers? Love you. (kisses)

17:12.861 --> 17:14.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Okay, okay!

17:14.496 --> 17:17.262
Well, I guess it's time to
go crush someone's dreams.

17:17.298 --> 17:19.531
- Mine?
- No. No, my good man.

17:19.567 --> 17:22.404
- Someone clearly beat me to that.
- Oh, good.

17:24.506 --> 17:26.638
Oh. Pardon me, breakfast monster.

17:26.675 --> 17:28.641
Gene, wait. I-I need
your help. Stay here.

17:28.677 --> 17:30.843
Bob, I'm going down to
check your basement for leaks

17:30.879 --> 17:32.979
and Felixes and whatnot
before the winter season.

17:33.014 --> 17:35.281
That's um, uh, okay.

17:35.316 --> 17:37.884
- Bob! Bob! We got brunch skunks!
- What?

17:37.919 --> 17:40.186
Brunch skunks! These people
just came for the drinks.

17:40.221 --> 17:41.954
Skunky little booze hounds.

17:41.990 --> 17:45.792
Miss, miss. We need
more drinks over here!

17:45.827 --> 17:48.528
- That a brunch skunk?
- Yes, definitely a brunch skunk.

17:48.563 --> 17:52.765
- (retches) Wait. Whose purse is this?
- (sighs) Oh, crap.

17:53.953 --> 17:57.170
Okay, we can save this. We'll
just tell all these people

17:57.195 --> 17:59.173
they have to go, and then
we'll seat everyone in line

17:59.197 --> 18:01.030
and tell them that they
have to order a meal.

18:01.055 --> 18:02.632
- Okay.
- Gene, go bus the tables.

18:02.667 --> 18:04.365
Take every glass, even if it's full.

18:04.390 --> 18:05.990
Louise, Tina, help your brother.

18:06.025 --> 18:09.426
Sure. But shouldn't Gene
go back outside, probably?

18:09.462 --> 18:11.295
No. No, no, no. W-We
need you guys in here.

18:11.330 --> 18:12.663
- And, Linda.
- What?

18:12.698 --> 18:14.331
You got to start giving out checks.

18:14.367 --> 18:15.599
(sighs): I know, I know.

18:15.635 --> 18:16.967
Be brave.

18:17.003 --> 18:19.203
(singsongy): Felix. I'm gonna getcha.

18:19.238 --> 18:20.938
I'm a-comin' to get you.

18:20.973 --> 18:22.439
You'll never get away.

18:22.475 --> 18:23.674
I got you now.

18:23.709 --> 18:26.143
I can smell you breathing, Felix.

18:26.178 --> 18:28.846
Caught you just at the last second.

18:28.881 --> 18:30.711
- (screams) Hi.
- (screams)

18:30.736 --> 18:31.476
Damn it!

18:31.501 --> 18:33.550
So, this is your check.

18:33.586 --> 18:34.985
I'm putting it down right here.

18:35.021 --> 18:36.516
I don't remember asking for the check.

18:36.541 --> 18:37.941
I want more drinks.

18:37.966 --> 18:40.334
Okay, well, no.

18:40.359 --> 18:42.031
We actually have to
cut you off. I'm sorry.

18:42.056 --> 18:45.957
The sign says
"bot-tom-less drinks."

18:46.332 --> 18:47.608
You can't just add a bottom.

18:47.633 --> 18:48.866
That's illegal.

18:48.891 --> 18:50.796
I'm calling 911.

18:50.821 --> 18:53.047
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

18:53.072 --> 18:54.405
In fact...

18:54.440 --> 18:56.540
all of you, you all have to go!

18:56.575 --> 18:57.841
Oh, Linda, no.

18:57.877 --> 18:59.209
Ow, my face!

18:59.245 --> 19:00.811
I'm gonna get my own drink.

19:00.846 --> 19:02.746
LINDA: No, no, no. No,
you aren't. Sit down.

19:02.782 --> 19:05.115
Ow, ow, ow. You're walking on my legs.

19:07.053 --> 19:07.928
(gasps)

19:07.953 --> 19:09.987
- Gotcha.
- Felix, run!

19:10.022 --> 19:11.388
- No!
- (grunts)

19:11.424 --> 19:14.591
Brunch brawl!

19:14.627 --> 19:16.827
(crowd clamoring)

19:16.862 --> 19:19.363
Mr. Fischoeder, what are
you doing?! Get off Gene!

19:19.398 --> 19:21.665
- You rang?
- Gene? Wait.

19:21.701 --> 19:23.767
- Who's in the suit?
- Felix Fischoeder.

19:23.803 --> 19:25.369
(chuckles) Sure. Makes perfect sense.

19:25.404 --> 19:27.049
- (cork pops)
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

19:27.073 --> 19:28.706
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:28.741 --> 19:31.442
No! No, it's not me! It's not me!

19:31.477 --> 19:33.243
I'm not Felix!

19:33.279 --> 19:35.379
Ha! 12:29!

19:35.414 --> 19:37.214
- 12:29!
- No!

19:37.249 --> 19:38.249
(siren wailing)

19:38.284 --> 19:40.084
911 is here!

19:40.119 --> 19:41.952
Now you're gonna be in big trouble.

19:41.987 --> 19:44.655
- So this is brunch, huh?
- I love it.

19:46.003 --> 19:48.425
Ah, thank God they're all gone.

19:48.461 --> 19:50.472
- The cops were nice.
- And we learned the police code

19:50.496 --> 19:52.563
for brunch brawl: ten-ten over easy.

19:52.598 --> 19:54.631
Well, you didn't beat my record,

19:54.667 --> 19:56.967
but you still get a birthday
present, just like always.

19:57.002 --> 19:58.769
Should we go pick out a car?

19:58.804 --> 20:00.804
- Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yay, car!
- (bell jingles)

20:00.840 --> 20:03.240
I can't believe you guys
hid Felix in the restaurant

20:03.275 --> 20:04.378
and we didn't even know.

20:04.403 --> 20:06.504
Yeah, and we fed him
and took care of him.

20:06.579 --> 20:07.792
Aw, that's nice.

20:07.832 --> 20:10.814
So that probably means
we could get a dog?

20:10.850 --> 20:12.058
It does not mean that at all.

20:12.083 --> 20:14.618
(groans, sniffs) You
guys serving lunch yet?

20:14.653 --> 20:16.553
Uh... Yeah, sure.

20:16.589 --> 20:18.288
- Lunchsquatch!
- Yay!

20:18.324 --> 20:20.057
- LINDA: And so I said,
- _

20:20.092 --> 20:22.993
"I don't get hungry, I
get fun-gry." (laughs)

20:23.028 --> 20:24.428
- Linda, that's amazing.
- (laughs)

20:24.463 --> 20:26.330
I'm putting that on a
shirt, and I'm wearing it

20:26.365 --> 20:27.965
- absolutely everywhere.
- (laughs)

20:28.000 --> 20:29.600
Brunch is served.

20:29.635 --> 20:31.680
Bob, I cannot believe you
cooked me a private brunch.

20:31.704 --> 20:33.570
- Of all the private brunches
- (kids laughing)

20:33.606 --> 20:36.073
I'm gonna go to this weekend,
this will probably be the best.

20:36.108 --> 20:39.076
Oh. Well, uh, thanks for,
uh, bringing your dog.

20:39.111 --> 20:40.627
- My-my kids appreciate it.
- (dog barks)

20:40.652 --> 20:43.514
Yeah, here's a picture of
all of us and you and the dog.

20:43.549 --> 20:45.415
Okay, what are you
guys doing to me there?

20:45.451 --> 20:47.041
Oh, we're stabbing you
so we can keep your dog.

20:47.066 --> 20:48.431
GENE: I'm using a pitchfork.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.344
DALTON: I feel really unsafe right now,

20:50.369 --> 20:51.816
- and that's not funny.
- (DOG BARKS)

20:51.841 --> 20:53.167
Just kidding, I love it.

20:53.192 --> 20:54.822
But am I wearing flip-flops? Because no.

20:54.847 --> 20:57.228

stabbing on the count of three!
