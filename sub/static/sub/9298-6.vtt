00:07.455 --> 00:09.921
Forward, march!

00:16.955 --> 00:19.888
Halt!
Make ready!

00:19.921 --> 00:22.288
Aim! Fire!

00:24.455 --> 00:27.389
Fire!

00:27.422 --> 00:29.322
Forward! March!

00:33.489 --> 00:34.855
Halt!

00:34.888 --> 00:36.422
Make ready!

00:36.455 --> 00:37.422
Aim!

00:37.455 --> 00:39.055
Fire!

00:42.888 --> 00:45.821
Forward! March!

00:45.855 --> 00:47.554
Halt!

00:47.588 --> 00:50.621
Aim! Fire!

00:52.088 --> 00:54.855
Making croissants
seems daunting,

00:54.888 --> 00:57.255
but really it's as easy
as making coq au vin.

00:57.288 --> 01:00.322
- To think it takes two days.
- Mm-hmm.

01:00.355 --> 01:01.588
Hey, Julia Childs, I could buy
a tube of those crescent things

01:01.621 --> 01:04.788
and serve 'em to you
in 20 minutes.

01:04.821 --> 01:06.455
No! Throw it to second!
Come on!

01:06.489 --> 01:08.455
W-why are you yelling?
You can't change the outcome.

01:08.489 --> 01:10.489
Really?

01:10.521 --> 01:12.288
Gee, I thought I could.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.389
That would require crossing
the space-time continuum.

01:14.422 --> 01:18.322
Go get the hand vacuum

01:18.355 --> 01:20.355
and clean up your couch crumbs.

01:20.389 --> 01:21.855
Ma, I'm trying to relax.

01:21.888 --> 01:24.554
Okay, and we are trying
to get ready for a guest.

01:24.588 --> 01:26.155
<i>Help out.</i>

01:30.022 --> 01:32.654
Come on, Maura, you're gonna
give yourself an ulcer.

01:32.688 --> 01:34.855
All right? It's not royalty.
It's your mom.

01:34.888 --> 01:37.688
Ulcers are caused by H. Pylori,
a bacteria.

01:37.721 --> 01:38.921
Or critical mothers.

01:38.955 --> 01:40.455
I'm not critical.

01:40.489 --> 01:41.755
Am I?

01:41.788 --> 01:43.422
She's never been
to my house before.

01:43.455 --> 01:45.322
Never?

01:45.355 --> 01:47.255
Well, what do you do
when she visits Boston?

01:47.288 --> 01:51.521
We just usually go to one
of my parents' homes in Europe.

01:52.355 --> 01:54.755
Those tulips are wilting
already.

01:54.788 --> 01:57.489
Yes, I could see
why you're so ashamed

01:57.521 --> 01:58.955
of this hideous place,

01:58.988 --> 02:02.855
<i>and forcing her to stay
in that disgusting guesthouse.</i>

02:02.888 --> 02:05.888
- What are you talking about?
- It's lovely. - Wait a minute.

02:05.921 --> 02:07.955
<i>If your mom is in the
guesthouse, where are you staying?</i>

02:07.988 --> 02:09.955
With you, of course.

02:09.988 --> 02:13.755
Fine, but just know
I don't serve coq au vin.

02:13.788 --> 02:16.521
I serve...Cocoa puffs.

02:16.554 --> 02:17.855
I know.

02:19.588 --> 02:22.521
Rizzoli.
Isles.

02:22.554 --> 02:25.055
- Okay. I'll be right there. 
- I'm on my way.

02:26.721 --> 02:28.688
I haven't even had a chance
to pre-order

02:28.721 --> 02:30.389
the organic pig's trotters.

02:30.422 --> 02:32.521
Are those feet?
I'm not eating feet.

02:32.554 --> 02:34.422
- I'm gonna leave you the butcher's number.
- Sure.

02:35.022 --> 02:37.055
Come on.

02:37.088 --> 02:38.688
You should change.

02:38.721 --> 02:40.355
All right.
I'll change in the car.

02:40.389 --> 02:41.721
<i>Then I'm driving.</i>

02:41.755 --> 02:43.721
Oh, come on.
I hate it when you drive.

02:43.755 --> 02:46.022
Well, I hate it more
when you undress and drive.

02:46.055 --> 02:47.888
Bye, ma.

02:47.889 --> 02:50.389

03:08.359 --> 03:10.292
All right, okay,
it's sort of a screwy hobby,

03:10.325 --> 03:13.025
but I used to love
this Rev War Reenactment stuff.

03:13.058 --> 03:14.359
I mean, it bugged me

03:14.392 --> 03:16.759
that they wouldn't let women
be minutemen, you know.

03:16.792 --> 03:18.258
Thousands of women served

03:18.292 --> 03:20.258
as laundresses, nurses,
seamstresses.

03:20.292 --> 03:23.092
<i>Gee, how fun is that?</i>

03:23.125 --> 03:24.858
All right, what do we got?

03:24.891 --> 03:26.158
Probably a stupid accident.

03:26.192 --> 03:28.792
Before everyone realized
he wasn't faking it,

03:28.826 --> 03:30.192
the whole thing
was probably over.

03:30.225 --> 03:32.991
Just takes one gun nut
smuggling in live ammo.

03:33.025 --> 03:35.325
Found his I.D.
In his powder horn.

03:35.359 --> 03:39.125
City I.D.
Gabe Buckner, 27.

03:39.158 --> 03:40.625
He was a garbage man.

03:40.659 --> 03:42.258
Maybe it wasn't an accident.

03:42.292 --> 03:44.292
Maybe somebody wanted him dead.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.125
Perhaps it was someone
who didn't like to recycle.

03:46.158 --> 03:48.058
Was that a joke?

03:48.092 --> 03:50.158
Only if it's funny.

03:50.192 --> 03:53.125
That's an odd-looking
entry wound.

03:53.158 --> 03:54.258
What is that?
Is that a musket?

03:54.292 --> 03:56.258
Hmm.
There's no exit wound.

03:56.292 --> 03:58.991
Hmm.
Unusually ragged edge.

03:59.025 --> 04:01.325
So, stabbed from a bayonet?

04:01.359 --> 04:04.792
Colonial militia didn't use
bayonets till 1778.

04:04.826 --> 04:06.092
Maura, shot or stabbed?

04:06.125 --> 04:07.891
Or did somebody chew
on his hip?

04:07.925 --> 04:09.925
Oh, I don't think
that's from a bite.

04:11.958 --> 04:13.258
Uh-oh.
Cavanaugh's here.

04:13.292 --> 04:15.025
Oh. This is a paid
tourist attraction.

04:15.058 --> 04:16.659
City's full of 'em,

04:16.692 --> 04:17.858
celebrating Liberty Days.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.726
Fascinating.
He was a smithy.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.225
Blacksmith.

04:21.257 --> 04:23.925
<i>Maura, it's pretend.</i>

04:25.292 --> 04:27.092
Perimeter's secured.
What next?

04:27.125 --> 04:29.292
I'll have a coffee --
two sugars, black.

04:29.325 --> 04:30.692
Oh.
Make that two.

04:30.726 --> 04:31.726
Oh, cappuccino, please.

04:31.759 --> 04:33.258
But only if there's 1% milk.

04:33.292 --> 04:34.958
Good thing you're not picky.

04:34.991 --> 04:37.692
Hey, I'm trying to
make detective,

04:37.726 --> 04:39.058
not become a barista.

04:39.092 --> 04:40.891
Bro, you know how many
coffee runs I had to make

04:40.925 --> 04:42.292
working my way up?

04:42.325 --> 04:44.792
Nothing for me,
but if you hustle those coffees,

04:44.826 --> 04:46.459
- I'll let you help me with 
witness statements. - Deal.

04:48.625 --> 04:49.858
Hey, I'll handle the media.

04:49.891 --> 04:51.292
We don't want to panic
the tourists.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.025
For now, it's an accident.
Got it, people?

04:53.058 --> 04:54.092
Yes, sir.

04:54.125 --> 04:55.891
Put your backs into it, men!

04:55.925 --> 04:57.826
What the hell
is this meathead doing?

04:57.858 --> 05:00.659
- Rizzoli, get him out of here?
- Yeah.

05:00.692 --> 05:02.158
- Move it forward!
- Ho, hey, ho, ho!

05:02.192 --> 05:04.025
It's a crime scene.
You can't be here.

05:04.058 --> 05:06.625
I was merely attempting to move
this artillery piece

05:06.659 --> 05:09.125
out of your way.

05:09.158 --> 05:10.425
Commanding officer
general Ezekiel Parker

05:10.459 --> 05:11.625
of the 16th Brigade.

05:11.659 --> 05:12.692
I'm Martha Washington.

05:12.726 --> 05:14.225
Let me see
your driver's license.

05:14.258 --> 05:15.592
Sure.
Of course.

05:18.392 --> 05:20.258
Dwayne Cravitz? Yeah, no wonder
you went with "Parker."

05:20.292 --> 05:21.826
It is such a pleasure
to meet you.

05:21.858 --> 05:23.425
Dr. Maura Isles.

05:23.459 --> 05:27.092
Professor Cravitz is a leading
authority on colonialism.

05:27.125 --> 05:28.359
I'm a huge fan.

05:28.392 --> 05:29.759
You're a huge fan
of colonialism?

05:29.792 --> 05:31.325
No, of course not.

05:31.359 --> 05:33.692
He's also the chair
of American History

05:33.726 --> 05:35.258
at Boston Cambridge University.

05:35.292 --> 05:37.058
Good doctor,
your words flatter me.

05:38.325 --> 05:39.826
I like your pretend accent.

05:39.858 --> 05:41.058
It's quite authentic.

05:41.092 --> 05:43.826
Colonial Americans spoke
rhotic English

05:43.858 --> 05:45.958
in a variety of regional
dialects -- Scots-Irish,

05:45.991 --> 05:48.192
west country --
where is the coffee?

05:48.225 --> 05:49.826
I got something better.

05:49.858 --> 05:52.759
Detective Rizzoli,
this is Maggie McGee.

05:52.792 --> 05:55.492
That's her boyfriend
over on the ground.

05:55.525 --> 05:56.925
I know this is difficult,

05:56.958 --> 05:58.459
but we do need to ask you
some questions.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.092
Are you kidding me?

06:00.125 --> 06:02.625
I want these war freaks to pay
for what they've done.

06:02.659 --> 06:04.492
Was your boyfriend
having any problems

06:04.525 --> 06:06.826
- with the other reenactors?
- I'll say.

06:06.858 --> 06:11.592
Was there anyone specific
who might have wanted Gabe dead?

06:11.625 --> 06:14.759
Oh, yeah. All of them.
They called him a "Farb."

06:14.792 --> 06:17.659
"Far be it from authentic."

06:17.692 --> 06:20.858
Just 'cause his uniform
was a poly-cotton blend.

06:20.891 --> 06:23.225
Even his buttons weren't
historically accurate.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.425
You believe that?

06:24.459 --> 06:25.958
Buttons?

06:25.991 --> 06:29.225
Just when you thought
you'd heard every motive.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.792
Penetrating injury
to the articular surface

06:34.826 --> 06:36.659
of the femoral head.

06:36.692 --> 06:38.025
He bled out.

06:38.058 --> 06:40.826
Huh. Say, doc, I was...

06:40.858 --> 06:43.759
I was wondering if...

06:43.792 --> 06:45.258
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

06:46.292 --> 06:47.891
Buddy of mine's
been having some chest pain.

06:47.925 --> 06:50.125
Didn't you just have
a physical?

06:50.158 --> 06:51.991
How'd you know it was me?

06:53.125 --> 06:56.891
Doctor says I'm fine.
So why am I short of breath?

06:56.925 --> 06:58.726
I've been eating better,
getting some exercise,

06:58.759 --> 07:01.058
- and I feel worse.
- Are you experiencing dizziness,

07:01.092 --> 07:02.359
light-headedness?

07:02.392 --> 07:03.826
Maybe a little.

07:03.858 --> 07:06.292
I want you to see
a cardiac specialist.

07:06.325 --> 07:07.759
Hey.

07:07.792 --> 07:09.891
Ballistics unit checked
the reenactors' weapons.

07:09.925 --> 07:11.125
They're all replicas.

07:11.158 --> 07:12.659
There's no sign
anyone used live ammo,

07:12.692 --> 07:15.092
- at least not in the muskets.
- Hmm.

07:15.125 --> 07:20.192
Some kind of a projectile
perforated the iliac artery.

07:24.759 --> 07:27.258
Copper-jacketed --

07:27.292 --> 07:29.958
<i>not from 1776.</i>

07:29.991 --> 07:31.392
Sheared off.
Looks like a .22 caliber to me.

07:31.425 --> 07:33.392
There appears to be
a dark granular substance

07:33.425 --> 07:35.925
on the exterior.

07:37.692 --> 07:40.025
Transfer.
That bullet ricocheted.

07:40.058 --> 07:43.392
So our shooter wasn't aiming
at old Gabe here.

07:43.425 --> 07:45.359
Well, if Gabe
was collateral damage,

07:45.392 --> 07:48.158
then who was our gunman
trying to kill?

07:50.337 --> 07:52.153
So, we could be looking
for a sniper.

07:52.952 --> 07:54.485
Wonder why he just shot once.

07:54.519 --> 07:56.719
Why's he shooting once
if Gabe wasn't his target?

07:56.752 --> 07:58.786
There are 48 reenactors --
24 patriots,

07:58.819 --> 08:01.817
24 redcoats -- all of them
were at the mock battle.

08:01.937 --> 08:04.062
These guys are all clean.
No one has a criminal record.

08:04.577 --> 08:06.819
We didn't find any other
bullets at the crime scene?

08:06.852 --> 08:09.585
Just the one Dr. Isles dug out
of the dead guy.

08:09.619 --> 08:11.886
So again, if our shooter
missed his target,

08:11.919 --> 08:14.552
- why didn't he take another shot?
- Not like he couldn't.

08:14.585 --> 08:16.852
Loud mock battle -- easily
cover the sound of gunfire.

08:16.886 --> 08:18.257
What the hell are you eating?

08:18.377 --> 08:20.786
Bean chili
and a side of zucchini.

08:21.519 --> 08:23.519
Don't ride with him.
Oof!

08:23.552 --> 08:26.052
- Since when did you become a vegan?
- A who?

08:26.086 --> 08:27.786
<i>More like a what --
it's the practice</i>

08:27.819 --> 08:29.719
of eliminating animal products
from your diet.

08:29.752 --> 08:31.052
Give up burgers?

08:31.086 --> 08:32.818
That's like asking me
to give up my sailboat.

08:32.852 --> 08:35.485
How can you be
this big animal lover

08:35.519 --> 08:36.719
and eat their flesh?

08:36.751 --> 08:39.284
I'm a complicated man.

08:39.318 --> 08:41.619
- What do you got?
- I've identified the substance on the bullet.

08:41.652 --> 08:44.585
It's ferrous oxide.

08:44.619 --> 08:46.685
Iron. Look at the ping mark.

08:46.719 --> 08:48.619
Well, I can't confirm
without more tests.

08:48.652 --> 08:50.452
Okay, folks,
we got confirmation.

08:50.485 --> 08:52.852
The bullet that killed Gabe
ricocheted off this iron cannon.

08:52.886 --> 08:55.685
Now, if we can figure out who
was standing around the cannon --

08:55.719 --> 08:57.153
we can figure out who
the shooter was aiming at.

08:57.186 --> 08:59.153
Laser will help us determine
where the shot came from.

09:01.952 --> 09:03.886
Let's go.

09:04.986 --> 09:07.318
Online shoe sale
about to close?

09:07.352 --> 09:08.886
I'm plugging in empirical data

09:08.919 --> 09:11.452
to back-extrapolate
the pre-impact orientation

09:11.485 --> 09:12.786
of the bullet.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.052
Okay. See that laser?
It does the same thing.

09:15.086 --> 09:17.186
I'm very good at trigonometry.

09:17.219 --> 09:18.552
What a relief.

09:18.585 --> 09:20.919
So once I input
the type of bullet,

09:20.952 --> 09:23.719
approximate the density
of the cannon,

09:23.752 --> 09:27.919
it appears the shooter
was 243.84 centimeters

09:27.952 --> 09:29.952
off the ground.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.352
What, you mean up there?

09:33.952 --> 09:36.485
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

09:36.519 --> 09:37.619
There we go.

09:37.652 --> 09:38.986
Okay, can you give me a boost?

09:39.019 --> 09:39.986
O-okay.

09:40.019 --> 09:40.952
Maura, no.

09:40.986 --> 09:42.485
Frost!

09:42.519 --> 09:45.318
I can get the crime-scene techs
here, all right?

09:45.352 --> 09:47.485
Oh, no, I was best tree climber

09:47.519 --> 09:49.552
year 6 at my boarding school.

09:49.585 --> 09:52.119
- Detective Frost, can you hand me my kit?
- Yeah.

09:52.153 --> 09:53.685
Here you go.

09:53.719 --> 09:54.886
You look ridiculous.

09:54.919 --> 09:56.986
I'm collecting
forensic evidence.

09:57.019 --> 09:59.552
Give me ridiculousness
or give me death.

09:59.585 --> 10:02.552
Jokes are supposed to be funny.
Remember, Thomas Paine?

10:02.585 --> 10:04.886
- Patrick Henry.
- Hey, found something.

10:04.919 --> 10:07.052
- Frankie, give me your hat.
- Don't you want an evidence bag?

10:07.086 --> 10:09.153
No.
Give me your hat.

10:11.019 --> 10:12.585
Come on.

10:12.619 --> 10:15.652
- Hey. Hello, Starsky.
- Starsky?

10:15.685 --> 10:17.986
We're looking for a sniper who's
shooting people in public parks.

10:18.019 --> 10:20.485
You want to hurry it up,
sergeant Dolittle?

10:20.519 --> 10:22.986
Well, come on, Jane.
Starsky deserves a chance.

10:23.019 --> 10:24.186
I found something!

10:24.219 --> 10:26.052
What is it --
hutch, the injured squirrel?

10:26.086 --> 10:28.153
Torn skin embedded in the bark.

10:28.186 --> 10:30.585
There's something else in there.

10:30.619 --> 10:32.253
Hold on.

10:36.786 --> 10:40.819
Thick, dark-brown,
oily substance.

10:43.786 --> 10:45.052
Cosmoline.
Gun oil.

10:45.086 --> 10:47.619
Used for storing
and preserving firearms.

10:47.652 --> 10:50.485
That's a good position
for shooting someone.

10:50.519 --> 10:51.952
But why'd he fire only once?

10:51.986 --> 10:54.086
He didn't.

10:54.119 --> 10:56.919
Found a second shell casing.

10:56.952 --> 10:58.552
Stove-piped.
That's why he stopped shooting.

10:58.585 --> 10:59.852
His gun jammed.

10:59.886 --> 11:03.253
Okay, who was standing
around that cannon?

11:05.852 --> 11:08.585
Professor, I need to know
who was positioned

11:08.619 --> 11:10.219
in the immediate vicinity
of the cannon.

11:10.253 --> 11:12.752
Our regiment engages
in improvised

11:12.786 --> 11:14.418
tactical demonstrations.

11:14.452 --> 11:16.619
- So spectators feel a
certain authenticity. - Mm-hmm.

11:16.652 --> 11:18.886
Which means you don't know.

11:18.919 --> 11:22.019
War is hell, detective Rizzoli.

11:22.052 --> 11:24.452
Pure unadulterated chaos.

11:24.485 --> 11:25.919
Good tip.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.886
Uh, were there any problems
between your members?

11:28.919 --> 11:31.452
My men are after freedom,
not each other.

11:31.485 --> 11:33.685
Enoch Byrd is a farmer.

11:33.719 --> 11:35.086
Josiah Hall is a cobbler.

11:35.119 --> 11:37.919
And Archibald Chestnut's
a blacksmith.

11:37.952 --> 11:41.385
Archibald was a garbage man
named Gabe Buckner,

11:41.418 --> 11:43.819
<i>and he's dead,
which is why we're here.</i>

11:46.019 --> 11:51.052
Nicole, you may, uh,
put the tray on the desk.

11:51.086 --> 11:54.186
Sugar was a true luxury item in 1774.

11:54.219 --> 11:57.153
Imagine what they would have
charged for Splenda.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.685
None for me, thank you.
Please.

12:00.719 --> 12:02.919
It's part of Nicole's education
as a PhD candidate.

12:02.952 --> 12:05.585
I'm professor Cravitz's
teaching assistant.

12:05.619 --> 12:07.519
Please, allow me to serve you.

12:07.552 --> 12:10.219
Women were domestic slaves
during colonial times.

12:10.253 --> 12:11.552
Thank you.

12:11.585 --> 12:14.019
Laundry lady, nurse,
seamstress,

12:14.052 --> 12:15.819
or domestic slave.

12:15.852 --> 12:17.952
So many choices,

12:17.986 --> 12:19.886
and they all sound like
so much fun.

12:19.919 --> 12:22.052
I teach my students
that the way to understand

12:22.086 --> 12:24.886
a culture fully
is to experience it firsthand.

12:24.919 --> 12:26.552
I'll have some.
Thank you.

12:26.585 --> 12:29.986
<i>I'm pretty sure there are laws
against slavery.</i>

12:30.019 --> 12:31.952
Shh.

12:31.986 --> 12:34.685
Thank you.
That'll be all.

12:37.852 --> 12:40.786
Do her parents know
they're spending $50,000

12:40.819 --> 12:43.186
for their daughter
to learn how to serve tea?

12:43.219 --> 12:46.086
$57,600.

12:46.119 --> 12:47.786
It's an honor, Jane.

12:47.819 --> 12:49.652
You know,
only top students are offered

12:49.685 --> 12:51.153
teaching-assistant
positions.

12:51.186 --> 12:53.786
Well, it's a massive waste
of their money

12:53.819 --> 12:54.919
and her I.Q. Points.

12:56.318 --> 12:58.719
Hello?

12:58.752 --> 13:01.418
What?!

13:01.452 --> 13:03.919
No!

13:03.952 --> 13:05.086
Yes!

13:05.119 --> 13:07.652
Um, o-okay.

13:07.685 --> 13:08.952
Okay. Thanks.

13:08.986 --> 13:09.952
Bye.

13:09.986 --> 13:11.519
U.P.S. Lose your shoes?

13:11.552 --> 13:13.719
No, it's my mother.
She's a day early.

13:13.752 --> 13:16.519
She caught a ride
on a friend's jet.

13:16.552 --> 13:18.452
Those pesky jets.

13:18.485 --> 13:20.886
Oh, my God.
What am I gonna do?

13:23.019 --> 13:25.685
Well, first of all,
stop doing that.

13:25.719 --> 13:28.585
Pig's trotters take two days
to marinate.

13:28.619 --> 13:30.552
Oh! And we're in the middle
of a case.

13:30.585 --> 13:31.786
What do I do?

13:31.819 --> 13:34.452
Vasoconstriction.
Hypocapnia.

13:34.485 --> 13:35.819
Okay.
Please, get ahold of yourself.

13:35.852 --> 13:38.119
Come on.
All right.

13:41.519 --> 13:42.986
Can you find
a nice place in the kitchen,

13:43.019 --> 13:44.652
maybe play a little soft music?

13:44.685 --> 13:46.452
Of course, sergeant.

13:46.485 --> 13:47.786
Starsky?

13:47.819 --> 13:50.086
Yeah, he's in good hands
with me.

13:51.852 --> 13:53.752
- Hi.
- Getting some coffee.

13:53.786 --> 13:55.519
Caffeine increases
blood pressure.

13:55.552 --> 13:56.786
Oh.

13:56.819 --> 13:58.153
Is Stanley around?

13:58.186 --> 13:59.652
No. He took a personal day.

13:59.685 --> 14:01.585
Good. Can you cook
a three-course dinner here?

14:01.619 --> 14:02.986
Eleven.

14:03.019 --> 14:04.619
Eleven?!

14:04.652 --> 14:06.952
Hors d'oeuvres, potage,
poisson, entre --

14:06.986 --> 14:10.385
sandwiches, peanut butter
and fluff, or take-out.

14:10.418 --> 14:12.418
What about relevé, sorbet,
roti, legume --

14:12.452 --> 14:14.886
oh, sure, Maura.
We'll just call Stanley in.

14:14.919 --> 14:17.986
Okay.

14:18.019 --> 14:19.052
Chef Renault.

14:19.086 --> 14:21.485
Chef Renault
from Maison De La Mer --

14:21.519 --> 14:22.619
he will help.

14:22.652 --> 14:24.652
You just tell him
that it's for me.

14:24.685 --> 14:25.752
Sure.

14:25.786 --> 14:28.086
Goodbye.

14:29.452 --> 14:33.285
Oh, hey, Frankie.
Got your hat.

14:35.886 --> 14:37.086
Thanks.

14:37.119 --> 14:39.418
Just got off the phone
with a reporter

14:39.452 --> 14:41.752
who's about to go live
with the sniper story.

14:41.786 --> 14:43.119
Oh, come on!

14:43.153 --> 14:44.552
Every nut job
with a dialing finger

14:44.585 --> 14:46.119
is gonna be calling in
with a tip.

14:47.919 --> 14:50.452
Yeah.
It's gonna be a long night.

14:50.485 --> 14:53.385
I better let the boys upstairs
know about this.

14:53.418 --> 14:55.652
Crap.
I'm supposed to be at Maura's.

14:55.685 --> 14:57.685
Hey! You want some more
practice at detective work?

14:57.719 --> 14:59.019
You want pizza or a sub?

14:59.052 --> 15:01.786
I want you to answer my phone
for me.

15:01.819 --> 15:03.852
Sure. No worries.
I got it.

15:03.886 --> 15:05.652
Yeah?

15:05.685 --> 15:07.519
Thanks a lot.
I owe you one.

15:07.552 --> 15:08.986
- Good night, guys.
- Good night!

15:09.019 --> 15:10.819
Boston homicide.
Korsak speaking.

15:12.986 --> 15:16.952
My mother is famous
for her dinner parties.

15:16.986 --> 15:19.652
The apple didn't fall far
from the tree.

15:19.685 --> 15:22.585
Oh, no. I couldn't possibly
live up to her.

15:22.619 --> 15:25.452
I mean, she'll spot take-out
in a second.

15:25.485 --> 15:27.086
Stop worrying!

15:27.119 --> 15:28.952
You're the perfect daughter.

15:29.919 --> 15:31.418
<i>And you're late.</i>

15:31.452 --> 15:34.052
Oh, I'm not perfect.
Darn.

15:34.086 --> 15:35.786
Cannolis.

15:35.819 --> 15:37.153
What are you doing?

15:37.186 --> 15:42.153
We already have dessert.

15:42.186 --> 15:44.819
Besides, cannolis aren't
sophisticated.

15:44.852 --> 15:46.719
Well, neither are we.
I got 'em for you.

15:46.752 --> 15:48.019
Oh.

15:48.052 --> 15:49.952
You got them for me?
Yeah.

15:49.986 --> 15:52.219
You're the perfect daughter.

15:53.986 --> 15:55.119
Oh. Okay.

15:55.153 --> 15:56.986
Okay. Go.

15:57.019 --> 15:59.385
Okay.
Don't worry.

15:59.418 --> 16:01.719
You look beautiful.

16:12.019 --> 16:12.986
Hello, mother.

16:13.019 --> 16:14.685
Hello, darling.

16:14.719 --> 16:16.052
You look well.

16:16.086 --> 16:18.153
Thank you.

16:19.919 --> 16:22.619
Mm-mmm.

16:22.652 --> 16:24.719
Country mice, meet city mice.

16:24.752 --> 16:26.219
Oh, my God. She's gorgeous.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.652
Stand up straight, Jane.

16:27.685 --> 16:30.585
Oh, crap.
I got cannoli oil on my shirt.

16:30.619 --> 16:33.418
Hello! Hello!

16:33.452 --> 16:36.986
Next month, I'm going to be
lecturing in Stockholm, Sweden,

16:37.019 --> 16:39.852
on the objectification
of the female form

16:39.886 --> 16:41.019
in post-war modernism.

16:41.052 --> 16:42.986
I find that fascinating.

16:43.019 --> 16:44.986
What do you know
about post-war modernism?

16:45.019 --> 16:47.219
I know a lot about
the objectification

16:47.253 --> 16:49.019
of the female form.

16:49.052 --> 16:50.619
Good point.

16:50.652 --> 16:51.752
Elbows off the table.

16:51.786 --> 16:54.385
What? Oh.
I thought I was perfect.

16:54.418 --> 16:57.385
Did I tell you that your father
is going to join me in Zagreb,

16:57.418 --> 16:59.986
for the German
expressionist festival?

17:00.019 --> 17:03.719
That's so great that you found
time in your busy schedule

17:03.752 --> 17:07.652
to come to Boston
and visit your daughter.

17:07.685 --> 17:09.484
Oh, well, I'm actually here
for an installation opening.

17:09.519 --> 17:11.852
Oh.
What are you installing?

17:11.886 --> 17:13.952
Sorry?

17:13.986 --> 17:15.417
Remember when I told you

17:15.452 --> 17:18.086
about my mother's
modern art installation?

17:19.519 --> 17:20.886
Let's have dessert.

17:20.919 --> 17:22.886
I made poire belle helene --

17:22.919 --> 17:24.318
your favorite.

17:24.352 --> 17:26.118
Try the cannoli.
They're my ma's favorite.

17:28.484 --> 17:31.378
<i>Je m'excuse,
mais je suis trés fatiguée.</i>

17:32.681 --> 17:34.546
She says she's sorry.

17:34.579 --> 17:36.546
She's tired.
Yes, I know.

17:36.579 --> 17:38.512
I didn't know you spoke French.

17:38.546 --> 17:40.029
I read body language.

17:41.646 --> 17:42.913
It was lovely to meet you both.

17:42.946 --> 17:44.379
You too.

17:44.412 --> 17:47.512
Um, I thought you were staying.

17:47.546 --> 17:49.178
I-I prepared the guesthouse
for you.

17:49.212 --> 17:50.712
Darling, didn't I mention

17:50.746 --> 17:52.946
that the gallery organized
for me to stay at the Ritz?

17:52.979 --> 17:55.345
And I already checked in.

17:55.379 --> 17:56.746
Of course.

17:56.779 --> 17:58.746
But I will see you
tomorrow evening

17:58.779 --> 18:01.612
for the welcoming dinner,
and you'll be my date.

18:01.646 --> 18:03.379
Sounds lovely.

18:03.412 --> 18:05.145
Please come to the opening.

18:05.178 --> 18:07.812
Just call the gallery and
have them put you on the list.

18:07.846 --> 18:10.712
The list?
Yeah, sure.

18:14.379 --> 18:16.245
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

18:16.279 --> 18:17.913
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

18:19.245 --> 18:21.746
Ma.

18:24.412 --> 18:27.679
Wow. She is...

18:27.712 --> 18:30.779
So, uh, put together.

18:30.812 --> 18:33.546
She's hard to get to know.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.779
Well, I think I got
a pretty good idea.

18:37.512 --> 18:39.846
Ma, really, with the pots
and the pans.

18:39.879 --> 18:42.345
Cincinnati can hear you.

18:42.379 --> 18:43.812
<i>See, you could have that
for a mother --</i>

18:43.846 --> 18:45.479
nosy and loud.

18:45.512 --> 18:48.445
And warm, involved.

18:48.479 --> 18:49.612
Grass is always greener.

18:49.646 --> 18:52.245
Yeah.

18:52.279 --> 18:56.178
You know, I used to dream
that I was adopted.

18:56.212 --> 18:58.512
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:58.546 --> 19:03.312
And my pretend mom was chic
and glamorous and educated.

19:04.546 --> 19:07.646
I always wondered what it would
be like to have a mother

19:07.679 --> 19:10.178
who cut the crusts
off my sandwiches.

19:10.212 --> 19:11.913
Annoying.

19:17.345 --> 19:20.345
Rizzoli.

19:20.379 --> 19:21.779
Where?

19:21.812 --> 19:24.379
I'll be right there.

19:24.412 --> 19:26.479
Come on.
We got another sniper shooting.

19:26.512 --> 19:28.345
Oh, God.

19:36.303 --> 19:38.036
Same casing
as our Rev War shooting --

19:38.070 --> 19:39.404
.22 caliber.

19:39.437 --> 19:41.470
If it's the same shooter,
what's he doing here?

19:41.504 --> 19:44.070
I don't know,
but we got another dead man.

19:45.337 --> 19:49.103
He wasn't shot.
He died of cardiac arrest.

19:49.137 --> 19:50.404
That's still murder.

19:50.437 --> 19:53.404
I'll do what I can
to play it down.

19:53.437 --> 19:56.370
How are we gonna play down
a sniper on the loose?

19:56.404 --> 19:57.637
I don't know.

19:57.670 --> 19:59.170
Are you okay?

19:59.203 --> 20:00.404
Yeah.

20:00.437 --> 20:02.103
Heartburn.

20:05.970 --> 20:07.270
<i>As you can imagine,</i>

20:07.303 --> 20:09.203
<i>Liberty Days are really
taking a beating</i>

20:09.237 --> 20:11.137
<i>because of all of this,
and officials say</i>

20:11.170 --> 20:12.936
<i>that it's fear
over the Boston Sniper</i>

20:12.970 --> 20:14.970
<i>that's keeping people
in their homes.</i>

20:15.003 --> 20:18.237
<i>The big question now is where
is this guy gonna strike next?</i>

20:18.270 --> 20:21.070
"Boston Sniper."
Come on.

20:21.103 --> 20:22.604
I think they should call him

20:22.637 --> 20:25.370
"the sniper who couldn't
shoot straight."

20:25.404 --> 20:28.003
Get it?
Because he keeps missing?

20:28.036 --> 20:30.070
Yeah. That's a...
Good joke, Maura.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.570
Really?

20:32.704 --> 20:34.070
Oh.

20:34.103 --> 20:35.537
Oh.

20:35.570 --> 20:39.504
Well, there's no indication
of cardiac disease.

20:39.537 --> 20:43.036
The stress from the gunshots
triggered a heart attack.

20:43.070 --> 20:45.470
Great, so we can charge
our sniper with two homicides --

20:45.504 --> 20:47.170
one by ricochet, one by fear.

20:47.203 --> 20:48.337
Who is this guy?

20:48.370 --> 20:50.303
You know,
snipers shoot to kill.

20:50.337 --> 20:52.137
This guy's missed people
both times.

20:52.170 --> 20:53.871
Is he trying to send a message?
What?

20:53.903 --> 20:58.036
Message is perfectly clear --
"I need target practice."

20:59.303 --> 21:02.570
Okay. You do your job
so I can do mine.

21:02.604 --> 21:05.804
Yes.
Of course, detective.

21:07.103 --> 21:09.070
Maura, I'm sorry.

21:10.170 --> 21:11.470
It's not you.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.970
Is it your mother?

21:15.537 --> 21:18.003
It's just --
it's hard to have her here

21:18.036 --> 21:19.103
and not see her.

21:19.137 --> 21:20.570
You know, when I was little,

21:20.604 --> 21:22.504
I wanted to be with her
all the time.

21:22.537 --> 21:26.070
I wanted to be on Mars --
alone.

21:26.103 --> 21:27.404
"Jane,
did you do your homework?

21:27.437 --> 21:29.470
"Jane, did you clean your room?

21:29.504 --> 21:31.303
Jane, Jane..."

21:31.337 --> 21:33.237
<i>She lives to hover!</i>

21:33.270 --> 21:35.003
Woman was a helicopter mother

21:35.036 --> 21:37.936
before they even invented
the term.

21:37.970 --> 21:39.270
Come on.

21:39.303 --> 21:40.437
Let's get you ready
for your artsy-fartsy dinner

21:40.470 --> 21:42.404
with your
globe-trotting mother.

21:42.437 --> 21:44.504
Got the ballistics back.

21:44.537 --> 21:47.036
Definitely the same ammunition
in both shootings.

21:47.070 --> 21:50.137
Get this -- the bullets
are at least 30 years old.

21:50.170 --> 21:52.036
That'd explain
why the gun jammed.

21:52.070 --> 21:54.070
Ammo's too old to trace
where it was purchased,

21:54.103 --> 22:00.837
but look at the ballistic's
fingerprinting.

22:00.871 --> 22:04.504
Yeah. Air force issued them
to pilots between '59 and '73.

22:04.537 --> 22:06.337
- It's compact, three-piece --
- Easy to smuggle

22:06.370 --> 22:08.970
into a Rev War Reenactment
without anybody noticing.

22:09.003 --> 22:12.036
It's a long shot,
but check the military records.

22:12.070 --> 22:14.137
- On it.
- All right.

22:18.203 --> 22:19.370
- Hello?
- Hey, ma.

22:19.404 --> 22:21.437
- Oh.
- What's up?

22:21.470 --> 22:22.871
Sure.

22:22.903 --> 22:24.537
- All right. Calm down.
- Of course.

22:24.570 --> 22:26.470
- Okay. I'll be right there.
- Bye.

22:27.871 --> 22:29.470
My mother's having
a bird emergency.

22:29.504 --> 22:31.970
Mine's changing dinner plans.

22:32.003 --> 22:33.437
Come on.
Let's go help.

22:33.470 --> 22:36.237
Oh, I went to go check up
on Starsky

22:36.270 --> 22:37.871
after the lunch rush.

22:37.903 --> 22:40.003
You took care of a sick parakeet
around food?

22:40.036 --> 22:41.270
Of course not!

22:41.303 --> 22:45.337
I put him by a sack of yams
in the pantry.

22:45.370 --> 22:46.537
You've got to help him.

22:46.570 --> 22:48.903
Sergeant Korsak
will never forgive me

22:48.936 --> 22:51.237
if something happens to him.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.170
Can you get me a bowl
of hot water and some towels?

22:55.203 --> 22:56.570
Okay.

22:56.604 --> 22:59.003
Okay.

22:59.036 --> 23:01.370
- Can you really save him?
- No.

23:01.404 --> 23:03.437
I just didn't want your mother
to see him die.

23:03.470 --> 23:04.970
Looks like avian flu.

23:05.003 --> 23:07.170
Avian flu?!
What the hell?!

23:07.203 --> 23:10.237
Well, you can only contract it
if you ingest his feces

23:10.270 --> 23:12.570
- or give him
mouth-to-mouth. - Stop.

23:13.903 --> 23:15.137
Korsak's here.

23:15.975 --> 23:18.170
- Hey. Any break in the case?
- Maybe.

23:18.203 --> 23:20.036
Rev War Reenactors are gonna
give Gabe the garbage man

23:20.070 --> 23:22.970
- an 18th-century wake tonight.
- Great. Okay. We should go.

23:23.003 --> 23:24.303
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I'll catch up with you.

23:24.337 --> 23:25.404
I just need to check something.

23:25.437 --> 23:27.637
In...The kitchen?

23:28.570 --> 23:30.337
Oh, all right.
It's Starsky.

23:30.370 --> 23:32.504
It's cold up there,
and Frost doesn't like him.

23:32.537 --> 23:33.537
He can feel it.

23:33.570 --> 23:36.170
Well...it's a bad time.

23:36.203 --> 23:38.837
Uh, ma is giving him
a bird bath.

23:38.871 --> 23:41.137
- Oh.
- But the wake, we should go.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.903
Ah, well, we got to wear
period costumes,

23:42.936 --> 23:44.404
or they won't let us in.

23:44.437 --> 23:46.604
I have wonderful contacts
at the historical society.

23:46.637 --> 23:50.070
Well, no, you can't go.
You have dinner with your mom.

23:51.370 --> 23:52.871
Oh, no, you don't.

23:52.903 --> 23:55.903
She called to cancel,
didn't she?

23:55.936 --> 23:58.303
It's not her fault.

23:58.337 --> 24:00.903
The dinner was
a private affair -- no guests.

24:00.936 --> 24:03.303
You're not a guest.
You're her daughter.

24:05.237 --> 24:08.203
You should come with us.

24:08.237 --> 24:10.237
Okay? It'd be great
to have your...

24:10.270 --> 24:12.203
Historical society contacts.

24:12.237 --> 24:13.470
Yeah.

24:13.504 --> 24:16.370
Yeah. See ya.

24:18.170 --> 24:20.103
Where's Starsky?

24:23.270 --> 24:24.404
He's dead?

24:24.437 --> 24:26.837
And you put him
in your -- ugh.

24:26.871 --> 24:29.170
- Where's ma?
- I told her I'd take care of him.

24:29.203 --> 24:30.370
You lied.

24:30.404 --> 24:33.036
No. No,
I just didn't say that...

24:33.070 --> 24:36.504
I was "taking care of"
his funeral arrangements.

24:46.903 --> 24:50.003
I can't believe I let you
talk me into wearing this.

24:50.036 --> 24:53.470
I don't think this thing's
been washed since 1776.

24:53.504 --> 24:56.003
You're not used to
the linsey-woolsey fabric.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.737
I told you to wear
the silk polonaise.

24:57.771 --> 24:59.704
Oh, yeah, the whale bones
digging into my boobs

24:59.737 --> 25:01.370
<i>would have been
much more comfortable.</i>

25:01.404 --> 25:04.003
The wig's kind of scratchy,
but we totally blend in.

25:05.137 --> 25:07.771
Yeah. Totally.

25:07.804 --> 25:09.970
You're just in time.

25:10.003 --> 25:12.103
We're about to begin
the eulogies.

25:14.237 --> 25:16.871
The victim's girlfriend's here.

25:18.871 --> 25:21.404
Let us raise
our tankards high...

25:21.437 --> 25:24.604
In memory of a great
and noble...

25:24.637 --> 25:25.637
Garbage man.

25:25.670 --> 25:27.003
Spirit.

25:27.036 --> 25:30.070
It's like we've stepped back in time.

25:33.270 --> 25:34.537
Maura.

25:34.570 --> 25:37.036
18th-century beer sucks.

25:38.303 --> 25:40.370
You made a joke!

25:40.404 --> 25:42.837
The crimson fountain
has opened.

25:42.871 --> 25:45.604
Let every man gird himself
for battle,

25:45.637 --> 25:49.137
but be not afraid,
for God is on our side.

25:49.903 --> 25:50.936
Gun!

25:54.437 --> 25:56.504
Go, go, go!

26:05.731 --> 26:07.697
- Nothing. You?
- No.

26:07.731 --> 26:10.531
Who was he after?

26:10.564 --> 26:13.231
I think we got a witness.

26:17.330 --> 26:18.397
You saw something?

26:18.430 --> 26:19.697
Oh, yeah.
The whole thing.

26:19.731 --> 26:22.198
I go out for a smoke,
and all of a sudden,

26:22.231 --> 26:23.265
there's all these bangs,
like...

26:23.297 --> 26:24.998
Bang! You know?

26:25.031 --> 26:26.397
The gunshots.
Yeah, that's it.

26:26.430 --> 26:28.931
So I look up, and there's
this car speeding off.

26:28.964 --> 26:30.165
Great. Okay.
So you saw the car.

26:30.198 --> 26:32.397
Oh, yeah.
I got a good look at it.

26:32.430 --> 26:33.564
It was white.

26:33.597 --> 26:35.664
The most popular car color --
great.

26:35.697 --> 26:37.364
I'll pull
the surveillance footage --

26:37.397 --> 26:38.964
compare it
to the other crime scenes.

26:38.998 --> 26:41.131
Yeah.
Get everybody in bric to help.

26:41.165 --> 26:43.664
Look for every white car
in the area near the shootings.

26:43.697 --> 26:45.330
Thank you.

26:51.064 --> 26:52.831
He starts by shooting
at a group of reenactors

26:52.864 --> 26:54.364
at Olmsted Park.

26:54.397 --> 26:56.064
Then he goes after shoppers
on Newbury Street --

26:56.098 --> 26:57.497
seems random.

26:57.531 --> 27:00.031
Then he tries to hit the
reenactors again at the wake --

27:00.064 --> 27:01.265
not random.

27:01.297 --> 27:03.964
But the three shootings
don't make sense.

27:03.998 --> 27:06.931
What if the Newbury Street
shooting was staged

27:06.964 --> 27:09.297
to keep us off the reenactors?

27:09.330 --> 27:11.931
So he could come back and finish
the job at the Irish bar?

27:11.964 --> 27:13.564
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

27:13.597 --> 27:15.964
I'm also thinking
we should find this guy

27:15.998 --> 27:17.064
before he strikes again.

27:17.098 --> 27:18.697
Think we just got lucky.

27:18.731 --> 27:21.731
Got a white Chevy that was in
the vicinity of Olmsted Park

27:21.764 --> 27:24.031
during the rev war reenactment.

27:24.064 --> 27:26.064
That same car was also
near the Irish bar.

27:26.098 --> 27:27.064
Nice work.

27:27.098 --> 27:28.597
Car's registered
to Kathleen Dunn

27:28.631 --> 27:30.297
of Dorchester.

27:32.131 --> 27:35.597
She's got a record --
food-stamp fraud.

27:35.631 --> 27:39.764
<i>Doesn't sound like a killer.
Let's go talk to her.</i>

27:45.297 --> 27:46.631
We're looking
for Kathleen Dunn.

27:46.664 --> 27:48.497
She's inside.

27:53.631 --> 27:55.297
Who are you?

27:55.330 --> 27:56.631
Boston homicide, ma'am.

27:56.664 --> 28:00.931
Benjamin!
Get in the house -- now!

28:00.964 --> 28:03.764
Kathleen!
Get your butt out here!

28:06.330 --> 28:08.464
Homicide?

28:08.497 --> 28:10.297
Ah, the Virgin Mother
and All the Saints,

28:10.330 --> 28:11.631
what the hell she do this time?

28:11.664 --> 28:12.831
Just want to talk to her.

28:14.364 --> 28:16.165
Is that your car?

28:16.198 --> 28:17.265
Why?

28:17.297 --> 28:18.631
Routine follow-up.
That's all.

28:18.664 --> 28:20.631
I don't know. Maybe it is.
Maybe it isn't.

28:20.664 --> 28:23.397
You always have to have such a smart
mouth. Answer the damn question.

28:23.430 --> 28:24.964
Why don't you mind
your own business, ma?

28:24.998 --> 28:26.265
Why don't you lose the mouth?

28:27.497 --> 28:30.697
Take her off my hands.

28:31.497 --> 28:33.364
<i>I thought my mom was tough.</i>

28:33.397 --> 28:34.564
Save it.

28:34.597 --> 28:36.330
You're not making
a personal connection,

28:36.364 --> 28:37.531
and I'm not spilling my guts.

28:37.564 --> 28:38.597
You people are fishing.

28:38.631 --> 28:40.265
We're being polite,
Ms. Dunn.

28:40.297 --> 28:42.564
We happen to know
that car is registered to you.

28:42.597 --> 28:44.497
We can and will
get a search warrant.

28:44.531 --> 28:47.297
If you had enough
to get a search warrant,

28:47.330 --> 28:49.165
you'd be handing it to me.

28:56.364 --> 28:58.898
Gee, you think
she knows the system?

29:02.297 --> 29:04.597
That Kathleen is one
smart cookie.

29:04.631 --> 29:05.964
She knows we don't find
probable cause,

29:05.998 --> 29:07.430
we're not getting near her.

29:07.464 --> 29:09.397
She goes after
the same group twice,

29:09.430 --> 29:11.064
then stages a random shooting.

29:11.098 --> 29:13.297
She's either after somebody
in the group...

29:13.330 --> 29:16.131
Or she's a whack job who enjoys
watching us run around.

29:16.165 --> 29:18.098
Your mother's a regular
Florence Nightingale, Jane.

29:18.131 --> 29:21.031
It's a miracle what she did.
Starsky's never looked better.

29:21.064 --> 29:22.731
Starsky's better?

29:22.764 --> 29:24.397
You look surprised.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.798
Me? No.

29:26.831 --> 29:30.430
<i>Yeah, she does have
a healer's touch.</i>

29:30.464 --> 29:32.464
Yum.
What are we eating now?

29:32.497 --> 29:35.064
What is that,
dirt-covered styrofoam?

29:35.098 --> 29:37.231
Oh, low-carb,
gluten-free, high-fiber.

29:37.265 --> 29:39.497
Ew. No, thank you.

29:39.531 --> 29:41.031
<i>Why are we so fancy?</i>

29:41.064 --> 29:43.964
I am going to my mother's
gallery opening.

29:43.998 --> 29:45.430
Wow.
She gonna put you on the list?

29:45.464 --> 29:47.198
We can get in.

29:47.231 --> 29:49.064
Who's "we"?

29:49.098 --> 29:51.497
Oh. How long have you
been eating these?

29:51.531 --> 29:52.664
Couple weeks.

29:52.697 --> 29:54.731
Part of my whole
new health regime.

29:56.564 --> 29:58.031
It's not a heart attack,
sergeant.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.430
- What?
- What?

29:59.464 --> 30:00.998
It's gas.

30:01.031 --> 30:05.064
Given the fiber content,
I imagine quite a lot.

30:05.098 --> 30:08.131
He's been making
enough to float the Hindenburg.

30:09.064 --> 30:11.597
Hydrogen gas was unfairly blamed for that.

30:11.631 --> 30:13.031
Human gas is actually
a mixture --

30:13.064 --> 30:15.297
hydrogen, carbon dioxide,
methane.

30:15.330 --> 30:18.430
Most people produce
about a half a liter a day.

30:18.464 --> 30:20.631
Well, exactly how much fart gas

30:20.664 --> 30:22.664
is Korsak making?

30:22.697 --> 30:24.798
Probably twice that amount.

30:24.831 --> 30:27.597
Okay, would you rather
I had a heart attack?

30:27.631 --> 30:29.430
Just stay away
from those crackers and beans,

30:29.464 --> 30:31.597
and you'll be fine.

30:32.764 --> 30:35.397
I was hoping you would go
to the installation with me.

30:35.430 --> 30:38.764
Oh...God, Maura,
I-I wish I could,

30:38.798 --> 30:40.964
but...No.

30:40.998 --> 30:42.564
<i>She --
she loves modern art.</i>

30:42.597 --> 30:45.165
You know what, Jane?
We got this.

30:45.198 --> 30:46.265
You go.

30:46.297 --> 30:47.631
Yeah, go.

30:47.664 --> 30:49.664
We know how much you like
these fresh ideas

30:49.697 --> 30:52.198
and crazy colors
and cubes and things.

30:52.231 --> 30:54.497
Oh, I'm so glad you've opened
your mind to it.

30:54.531 --> 30:55.731
Yeah.

30:55.764 --> 30:57.631
You two have fun, now.

30:57.664 --> 30:59.931
Thanks, guys.

31:09.531 --> 31:13.265
How did Starsky make
such a miraculous recovery?

31:13.297 --> 31:16.564
Luckily, the pet store
carries parakeets.

31:26.907 --> 31:28.474
I'm sorry.
This is a private gathering.

31:28.507 --> 31:30.568
Oh. This is
Dr. Maura I sles.

31:30.688 --> 31:32.177
She's the artist's daughter.

31:32.437 --> 31:34.068
Yeah.

31:34.188 --> 31:36.220
Really?

31:36.340 --> 31:38.800
She couldn't even be bothered
to put you on the list?

31:38.920 --> 31:40.998
She was busy.
She said she'd try.

31:41.118 --> 31:42.327
Yeah.
I don't see you.

31:42.447 --> 31:45.440
You see me now?
Detective Jane Rizzoli.

31:45.474 --> 31:47.041
Yeah. Go ahead.

31:53.574 --> 31:57.807
Hanging water bottles is art?

31:57.841 --> 31:59.874
It's an iconic representation
of the deconstruction

31:59.907 --> 32:03.041
of our food chain
as a symbol of neo-urbanity.

32:03.074 --> 32:04.907
<i>I could do that.</i>

32:04.941 --> 32:07.008
Yes, but then
it wouldn't be art.

32:07.041 --> 32:10.207
Hello, darling.
You made it.

32:11.474 --> 32:13.440
Sorry we had to crash.

32:13.474 --> 32:14.907
Your daughter
wasn't on the list.

32:14.941 --> 32:16.641
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

32:16.674 --> 32:18.641
Mother, it's exquisite.

32:18.674 --> 32:21.941
It's both witty
and full of pathos.

32:21.974 --> 32:24.140
It is, isn't it?

32:24.173 --> 32:26.008
<i>Oh, it is.</i>

32:28.008 --> 32:31.041
<i>So nice to see you again, Jane.</i>

32:31.074 --> 32:33.041
You too.

32:33.074 --> 32:35.607
Maura, would you mind getting us
something to drink?

32:35.641 --> 32:39.041
I'd love to get to know
your mother better.

32:39.074 --> 32:41.641
Um, sure.

32:41.674 --> 32:43.273
Excuse me.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.194
Nice of you to come.

32:47.227 --> 32:49.626
Thank you.

32:49.660 --> 32:53.361
<i>I love your
hanging water bottles.</i>

32:53.394 --> 32:55.927
They make me feel very guilty,

32:55.960 --> 32:58.727
<i>and I'll never buy water again.</i>

33:00.027 --> 33:02.060
I-I can see
why Maura likes you.

33:02.094 --> 33:04.927
You're direct.
It's kind of refreshing.

33:04.960 --> 33:08.194
I'm protective.
Maura's my best friend.

33:08.227 --> 33:11.793
I sense that there's something
you'd like to say to me.

33:11.827 --> 33:12.960
Yeah. There is.

33:12.994 --> 33:15.394
I don't like seeing
my best friend hurt.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.127
<i>You think I hurt her?</i>

33:17.160 --> 33:20.927
Not staying with her,
canceling dinner,

33:20.960 --> 33:23.927
"forgetting" to put her on
the list of your installation?

33:23.960 --> 33:25.927
Yeah, I think that hurts her.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.960
She's the chief
medical examiner.

33:27.994 --> 33:29.260
She has her own life.

33:29.294 --> 33:32.060
You're both out there working
an important case.

33:32.094 --> 33:33.194
It's all over the news.

33:33.227 --> 33:35.027
I don't want to be in her way.

33:35.060 --> 33:37.927
She must know how proud I am of her,

33:37.960 --> 33:39.260
how much I love her.

33:39.294 --> 33:42.027
Not really the signals
you're sending.

33:42.060 --> 33:43.427
It seems to me
like you were too busy

33:43.461 --> 33:44.994
while she was growing up,

33:45.027 --> 33:47.626
and now you're blaming her
for being too busy --

33:52.461 --> 33:55.727
I was --
I was never any good at it.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.294
At what?

33:57.327 --> 33:58.994
Being a mother.

33:59.027 --> 34:02.394
I feel like I just...
I missed so much.

34:02.427 --> 34:04.094
Why don't you
just tell her that?

34:04.127 --> 34:07.294
So sorry to interrupt,

34:07.327 --> 34:09.960
but our patrons are waiting
for your speech.

34:12.060 --> 34:13.393
Would you excuse me?

34:22.893 --> 34:24.260
Korsak.
What do you got?

34:24.293 --> 34:25.893
Found a connection
between the Rev War group

34:25.927 --> 34:27.127
and Kathleen Dunn.

34:27.159 --> 34:29.293
She was Cravitz's T.A. at BCU.

34:29.327 --> 34:30.927
Kathleen Dunn went to BCU?

34:30.960 --> 34:32.260
Yeah.
On a full ride.

34:32.293 --> 34:33.860
She dropped out as a freshman

34:33.893 --> 34:35.460
a month after she filed
a rape charge.

34:35.493 --> 34:36.827
Anything to it?

34:36.860 --> 34:38.127
Seems like it.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.226
Campus police did a rape kit,

34:39.260 --> 34:40.493
but it was never processed.

34:40.525 --> 34:42.760
Did she name her rapist?
Yeah. Cravitz.

34:42.793 --> 34:44.927
All right. Thanks.
I'll be right there.

34:46.260 --> 34:48.293
Jane, what is it?

34:48.327 --> 34:50.693
Well, it seems like
18 years ago,

34:50.726 --> 34:52.760
our suspect claims
that she was raped

34:52.793 --> 34:54.793
by one of
the Rev War Reenactors.

34:54.827 --> 34:56.060
Which one?

34:56.094 --> 34:58.927
Professor Cravitz.

35:01.327 --> 35:02.727
This is bullshit.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.160
You better not have
torn apart my house.

35:04.194 --> 35:07.860
Nobody tore apart your house, Kathleen.

35:07.893 --> 35:09.860
We did find these, though.

35:09.893 --> 35:11.893
Valedictorian.
Full scholarship to BCU.

35:11.927 --> 35:13.160
Everything going for you.

35:13.194 --> 35:14.793
Until you became
professor Cravitz's intern.

35:14.827 --> 35:16.294
I didn't do anything.

35:16.327 --> 35:18.094
You filed a rape charge
against your professor,

35:18.127 --> 35:20.727
but you didn't pursue it.

35:20.760 --> 35:23.160
That was a long time ago.

35:23.194 --> 35:27.960
We have your stepfather's
military records from 1967.

35:27.994 --> 35:30.127
He was issued an AR-7
Armalite rifle.

35:30.160 --> 35:33.827
Fires .22-caliber bullets,
same as our shootings.

35:33.860 --> 35:34.960
Why, Kathleen?

35:34.994 --> 35:37.294
Why go after Cravitz
18 years later?

35:37.327 --> 35:39.827
I'm not saying
he didn't deserve it.

35:39.860 --> 35:41.994
Why try to kill
your rapist now?

35:42.027 --> 35:44.461
You worried about your house?

35:44.493 --> 35:46.827
I guarantee we will turn
your life inside --

35:46.860 --> 35:50.094
I wanted to change history...

35:50.127 --> 35:52.027
But you can't.

35:52.060 --> 35:55.060
That man ruined my life.

36:01.027 --> 36:03.893
Jane!
I got the DNA results back

36:03.927 --> 36:05.394
from the skin
that we found on the tree.

36:05.427 --> 36:07.827
Yeah, we just got a full
confession from Kathleen Dunn.

36:07.860 --> 36:09.560
But the DNA was male.

36:11.827 --> 36:13.027
You're sure?

36:13.060 --> 36:15.194
Yes.

36:16.260 --> 36:17.727
My gut said that was too easy.

36:17.760 --> 36:18.893
Nobody rolls over that quickly

36:18.927 --> 36:20.427
unless they're covering
for someone.

36:36.231 --> 36:38.066
This is not
your brother, Kathleen.

36:38.099 --> 36:40.899
- Yes, it is.
- Ben is your son.

36:40.932 --> 36:43.865
He was born nine months
after you reported being raped

36:43.899 --> 36:45.365
by your professor.

36:48.298 --> 36:51.066
Ben doesn't know the truth.

36:51.099 --> 36:52.865
He will never know.

36:52.899 --> 36:53.965
He knows, Kathleen.

36:53.999 --> 36:55.231
He knows you're his mother

36:55.265 --> 36:57.032
and Dwayne Cravitz
is his father,

36:57.066 --> 36:58.865
and that's why
he tried to kill him

36:58.899 --> 37:00.432
at the Rev War Reenactment.

37:00.465 --> 37:02.699
He's smart. Tried to throw us
off the trail at Newbury Street.

37:02.732 --> 37:04.132
Until he could try again.

37:04.166 --> 37:05.965
And that's when he fired
at Cravitz

37:05.999 --> 37:07.198
outside the Irish bar.

37:07.231 --> 37:09.765
No. No.
Ben has an alibi.

37:09.799 --> 37:11.265
His friends were throwing him
a going-away party.

37:11.298 --> 37:12.665
I can prove it.

37:12.699 --> 37:14.632
You figured out
what Ben was up to --

37:14.665 --> 37:16.398
<i>you made sure he had an alibi.</i>

37:16.432 --> 37:18.999
Because you knew
he wouldn't stop

37:19.032 --> 37:20.932
until he killed his father.

37:20.965 --> 37:23.066
And that's why you were gonna
do it for him.

37:24.899 --> 37:28.231
That was you outside
the Irish bar, wasn't it?

37:28.265 --> 37:29.899
Yes.

37:29.932 --> 37:32.231
<i>Yes, it was me.
It was all me.</i>

37:32.265 --> 37:33.832
Where is he?
Where's Ben?

37:33.865 --> 37:35.765
This is all my fault.

37:35.799 --> 37:37.231
I should never have told him.

37:37.265 --> 37:39.832
But he kept asking me questions
about his father,

37:39.865 --> 37:42.365
and I thought he was old enough
to know the truth.

37:42.398 --> 37:45.432
How do you tell a child
his father is a rapist?

37:45.465 --> 37:51.632
Please.

37:51.665 --> 37:53.099
It wasn't him.

37:53.132 --> 37:55.932
He didn't do it.

37:55.965 --> 37:58.331
I did. Just...

37:58.365 --> 38:00.932
He's on his way
to a better life.

38:00.965 --> 38:02.732
He's going to college.

38:02.765 --> 38:04.265
Where is he, Kathleen?

38:07.166 --> 38:09.965
He's gone.

38:09.999 --> 38:11.932
I took him to the airport
this morning.

38:13.099 --> 38:16.665
What do you want to bet
Ben didn't get on that plane?

38:16.699 --> 38:19.298
Hmm?

38:22.832 --> 38:25.166
Greetings, fair citizens,

38:25.231 --> 38:28.832
and welcome to our monthly
Town Hall meeting.

38:28.865 --> 38:32.732
As you know,
the colonists were angry

38:32.765 --> 38:35.032
about the writs of assistance,

38:35.066 --> 38:38.265
which they argued
violated natural rights

38:38.298 --> 38:41.166
described by John Locke
during the enlightenment.

38:43.265 --> 38:45.398
Do you have a question,
young lad?

38:45.432 --> 38:47.465
Yes. What about my mother's rights?

38:47.498 --> 38:49.231
She was your student...

38:49.265 --> 38:50.865
And you raped her!

38:50.899 --> 38:52.865
Hey, Ben?

38:52.899 --> 38:54.832
Hey. Put it down.
All right?

38:54.865 --> 38:56.699
Come on. Don't do this.
Think about your mother.

38:56.732 --> 38:57.999
Hasn't she suffered enough?

38:58.032 --> 38:59.999
Get away from me!
Wait a minute.

39:00.032 --> 39:02.231
Listen to me, okay?
I can help you.

39:02.265 --> 39:03.965
All right?
I can talk to the D.A.

39:03.999 --> 39:05.598
I can tell him
it was an accident.

39:05.632 --> 39:06.899
You didn't mean
to hurt those people.

39:06.932 --> 39:08.965
- It won't make a difference.
- It will.

39:08.999 --> 39:11.132
It will, Ben.

39:11.166 --> 39:12.398
Okay?
The truth will come out.

39:12.432 --> 39:15.032
Let this man live
with what he did

39:15.066 --> 39:16.832
for the rest of his life.

39:16.865 --> 39:19.198
No!
No! Please!

39:19.231 --> 39:21.899
Please let me shoot him!

39:21.932 --> 39:23.465
You don't understand
what he did to my mother.

39:25.099 --> 39:26.865
All right, Ben.

39:26.899 --> 39:29.066
No. No.

39:34.198 --> 39:37.032
You cannot believe
how healthy Starsky is.

39:37.066 --> 39:39.066
<i>Yeah, didn't you find he had
more turquoise feathers</i>

39:39.099 --> 39:40.465
after he recovered?

39:40.498 --> 39:42.398
Ow!

39:43.832 --> 39:45.265
What's the matter?

39:45.298 --> 39:47.032
Gas...Pains.

39:47.066 --> 39:48.432
- Really?
- Mm.

39:48.465 --> 39:50.799
Wow. My mother's here.

39:50.832 --> 39:53.265
I thought she was in Paris.

39:53.298 --> 39:55.432
She forgot to say goodbye.

39:57.765 --> 39:59.198
May I join you?

39:59.231 --> 40:00.865
Mother.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.498
What a lovely surprise.

40:02.532 --> 40:04.265
Hello, darling.

40:04.298 --> 40:06.665
I couldn't go without seeing you
one more time.

40:08.198 --> 40:11.231
- Sit.
- Um, here...

40:11.265 --> 40:14.265
<i>Oh, don't worry.
I'm not that fussy.</i>

40:16.066 --> 40:18.632
- Here.
- Oh.

40:21.231 --> 40:22.965
Strange. Wonder where Maura gets it.

40:22.999 --> 40:25.231
You like greasy hamburgers?

40:25.265 --> 40:28.699
<i>Actually, I'd love a hamburger.
It's been years.</i>

40:28.732 --> 40:31.365
Oh, good, 'cause this place has
some really good ones

40:31.398 --> 40:33.265
after the health department
shut it down.

40:33.298 --> 40:34.732
The health department?
Mm-hmm.

40:34.765 --> 40:35.999
Mom, it's a joke.

40:36.032 --> 40:38.365
She likes to kid.

40:38.398 --> 40:40.166
Milkshake.

40:40.198 --> 40:42.465
I haven't had one for ages.

40:42.498 --> 40:44.899
Oh, God, I love them.

40:44.932 --> 40:47.832
- Really? I-I didn't know that.
- No?

40:47.865 --> 40:50.166
I-I would like one.
Strawberry.

40:50.198 --> 40:51.365
Since when do you like
milkshakes?

40:51.398 --> 40:52.799
<i>Since now.</i>

40:52.832 --> 40:55.432
All right.
I'm having a beer.

40:55.465 --> 40:57.265
A beer milkshake?

40:57.298 --> 40:59.432
Yes. Uh, yes.

40:59.465 --> 41:00.932
A beer milkshake.

41:00.965 --> 41:03.198
It's what all the mooks
here in Boston drink.

41:03.231 --> 41:04.632
Okay. She's kidding.
She's kidding.

41:04.665 --> 41:05.665
It's another joke.

41:05.699 --> 41:07.865
Oh. Oh.

41:07.899 --> 41:10.398
Well, I can certainly see
the family resemblance.

41:10.432 --> 41:13.265
Well, I can see
the family resemblance, too.

41:13.298 --> 41:14.899
You do?

41:14.932 --> 41:17.166
Yes, the two of you
are so much alike.

41:18.532 --> 41:19.432
- What is it?
- What is it?

41:19.465 --> 41:21.166
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

41:21.198 --> 41:23.099
You want a peanut?

41:23.132 --> 41:24.331
They're really good.

41:24.365 --> 41:25.865
Thank you.

41:25.899 --> 41:27.465
Have someone come by
and shell them for you.
