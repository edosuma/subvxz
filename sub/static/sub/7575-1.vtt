WEBVTT

00:31.781 --> 00:33.115
Okay, here we go.

00:33.783 --> 00:36.493
Oh, wow.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.412
Oh, my God, you guys.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.165
Oh, my God, Rachel, you suck.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.919
- It's a private party.
- It's okay, they're kind of expecting me.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.177
- Shake it, shake it
- Let me hear you now

00:53.344 --> 00:55.304
Shake it, shake it, shake it

00:55.472 --> 00:58.015
- Shake it, shake it
- Let me hear you now

00:58.183 --> 00:59.224
Hello?

01:00.602 --> 01:02.311
Surprise!

01:09.444 --> 01:12.321
I know you told me not to,
but I just had to.

01:12.489 --> 01:13.822
I just had to.

01:13.990 --> 01:16.116
- You're not mad, are you?
- No, it's sweet.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.409
And are you surprised?

01:17.577 --> 01:19.161
Was I surprised?

01:19.746 --> 01:22.206
- You were?
- Ugh. Was I?

01:22.373 --> 01:24.166
She was surprised!

01:24.709 --> 01:28.003
You don't want this.
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. We did it!

01:41.518 --> 01:44.353
- No! Oh, no, sorry, somebody's in here.
- Ow!

01:44.604 --> 01:46.188
It's me.

01:47.107 --> 01:51.819
- Ow. Not afraid to put your back into it.
- What are you doing in the ladies' room?

01:51.986 --> 01:54.238
What? I saw you come in here,
looking all tragic.

01:54.405 --> 01:56.532
So I'm here to check for razor blades.

01:56.699 --> 01:58.325
You were not coming in here for me.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.701
You're dodging Claire.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.995
See what happens when you sleep
with people you don't love?

02:02.163 --> 02:04.248
- That's insulting.
- Why don't you talk to her?

02:04.415 --> 02:05.666
Rachel, she's crazy.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.047
- There you are.
- Good God.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.465
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:13.633 --> 02:17.052
Where have you been all night, mister?
Mr. Magoo. Ha-ha-ha.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.972
Just hiding. Yeah.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.682
Hiding. Ha-ha-ha.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.853
- It's so, like, chaotic in here.
- Yep.

02:26.020 --> 02:30.649
Do you wanna...? Do you wanna go
someplace more, like, um, intimate or...?

02:30.817 --> 02:32.860
No. Party. So I think I'll stay here.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.487
- Me neither. I don't want to either.
- Yep. Awesome.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.197
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

02:37.365 --> 02:39.908
I want you to see me drop it like it's hot.
One second.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.577
- This is awesome.
- Talk to her.

02:42.537 --> 02:45.581
When she walked in... Aah!

02:46.583 --> 02:47.749
Hey!

02:47.917 --> 02:49.835
- That was very nice of you.
- What?

02:50.003 --> 02:51.336
Pretending to be surprised.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.755
- Please don't tell her. She'll be heartbroken.
- I won't.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.259
What's going on, Dex?

02:57.427 --> 03:00.179
How you doing? You gonna introduce me
to the birthday girl?

03:00.346 --> 03:04.725
Rachel, this is Marcus.
Old family friend. Just moved into town.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.435
What up, birthday girl?

03:06.603 --> 03:07.728
Please stop saying that.

03:07.937 --> 03:12.482
Don't worry. The capacity to be pleasured
only increases with age.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.235
- Trust me.
- Wow.

03:15.403 --> 03:18.363
What's up? What's your name?
You got a boyfriend?

03:18.531 --> 03:20.699
- Wow.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

03:20.867 --> 03:21.909
Hello.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.785
Hello.

03:24.454 --> 03:28.290
I'm gonna say something.
And I know everybody wants to hear it.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.125
Center of attention. That's weird.

03:30.293 --> 03:34.630
All right, well, as most of you know,
I'm getting married in 61 days.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.801
And, Dex, honey,
I have a confession to make.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.678
This won't be my first marriage.

03:43.598 --> 03:44.765
I wanna shoop, baby

03:44.933 --> 03:49.228
Yep. Rachel and I have been soul mates
since the beginning.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.648
Like two peas in a pod,
we did everything together.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.733
Like re-enacting Dirty Dancing.

03:54.901 --> 03:58.987
And our infamous dance routine
to Salt-N-Pepa's "Push lt."

03:59.405 --> 04:02.157
We basically shared everything.
Including Ethan.

04:02.325 --> 04:05.160
Oh, shit. Why am I in this?

04:05.328 --> 04:07.663
Our date to the sixth grade dance.

04:08.581 --> 04:12.000
And through all the years,
Rachel and I were inseparable.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.086
It was us against the world.

04:15.004 --> 04:20.591
And after we graduated Indiana,
she ditched my ass for stupid law school...

04:20.760 --> 04:24.680
...despite the fact
that I selflessly rejected...

04:24.847 --> 04:28.058
...my acceptance to Notre Dame...

04:28.226 --> 04:30.018
...because she wasn't let in.

04:30.645 --> 04:31.687
But whatever.

04:31.854 --> 04:36.108
It all worked out in the end,
because she went to NYU Law...

04:36.317 --> 04:41.029
...and met my future husband,
and introduced us.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.701
I'll never forget, when Dex proposed...

04:45.868 --> 04:48.704
...all I could think about
when he was down on one knee...

04:48.871 --> 04:50.872
...was that I wish Rachel was here...

04:51.332 --> 04:53.208
...watching me in this moment.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.793
Sorry. Who are we celebrating?

04:54.961 --> 05:00.340
I mean, to say you are my best friend
is the understatement of the century.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.844
You're the sister I never had.

05:04.470 --> 05:08.056
You're sometimes the mother
I often need.

05:08.850 --> 05:13.437
The reason why I can stumble
so fearlessly into adventure...

05:13.604 --> 05:16.565
...is because she's always there.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.735
She is always, always there.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.322
I love you, Rachel.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.741
I love you too.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.743
Happy 30th!

05:27.910 --> 05:29.536
I'm so happy it's not me yet!

05:30.413 --> 05:34.082
All right. Come on, let's get this
party going. Come on, come on.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.086
And shake it, shake it.

05:44.594 --> 05:45.969
Wow.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.431
So are you two, like, uh...?

05:49.849 --> 05:51.850
A couple? Nope.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.435
- No?
- Nope.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.395
You guys ever...?

05:57.732 --> 05:59.191
- No. No.
- No?

06:00.234 --> 06:01.860
Shake it, Darcy!

06:02.028 --> 06:05.364
You know what, sweetheart?
I think it's time that you came down.

06:07.533 --> 06:11.578
Rachel, tell him to let me stay.

06:11.829 --> 06:15.707
Come on, I did the party.
I'm the one who did it.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.543
- Honey, I love you so much.
- I love you.

06:18.711 --> 06:23.173
- Did you like it? Did you like your party?
- I did. I loved it.

06:25.802 --> 06:30.722
Oh, my God, remind me to buy you
new shoes. I just hate your shoes so much.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.432
Okay, yep, time to go home.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.602
- I hate them.
- You know what? She'll call you tomorrow.

06:35.770 --> 06:39.147
I don't understand why you think,
"I'm gonna buy that pair of shoes."

06:39.315 --> 06:42.567
- Happy birthday.
- Hey, thank you.

06:51.327 --> 06:52.828
Never helps, but I do it anyway.

06:52.995 --> 06:55.580
There's an old maid in the window.
Let's get her a cat.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.165
Okay, you're not old.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.584
You're just a lawyer. It's different.

06:59.752 --> 07:03.505
I'm serious, Ethan.
Thirty's young, but it's not that young.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.007
- Okay. Ten-second pity party. Go.
- Ethan.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.677
I'm past my prime child-bearing years.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.179
Wow. Okay.
I didn't know we were going dark.

07:11.347 --> 07:14.307
I basically wasted my entire 20s.

07:14.767 --> 07:15.851
And I hate my job.

07:16.018 --> 07:17.853
Okay, two things? You went way over.

07:18.020 --> 07:22.691
And, secondly, you didn't waste your 20s.
You just grew up.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.484
Why won't you marry me?

07:24.652 --> 07:26.027
Because I like you too much.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.698
Ah! Perfect timing.

07:31.367 --> 07:32.993
Dex.

07:33.202 --> 07:36.705
- Hey, what's going on?
- Darcy forgot her purse.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.292
- Her new Chanel?
- Not the new Chanel! Let's go.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.503
- Come on.
- Oh. I'm gonna go help him find it.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.046
Are you serious?

07:45.214 --> 07:47.799
It's like a $2000 handbag.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.634
Dudes aren't supposed to know that.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.428
In or out, asshole?

07:51.596 --> 07:53.180
You need a hug, buddy.

07:54.015 --> 07:57.559
Oh! And voilÃ .

07:57.727 --> 07:59.895
- Oh!
- Ha-ha-ha.

08:00.062 --> 08:01.646
- You all right?
- Mm-hm.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.565
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.777
Thank you. Come on. I'll get you a taxi.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.327
So did you have a good time tonight?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.704
Yeah, I did.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.541
I did!

08:28.049 --> 08:30.509
Hey. Let's get one more drink.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.844
Oh, no, that's okay. You don't have to.

08:33.011 --> 08:35.054
Come on. I want to.

08:39.434 --> 08:41.477
Two Heinekens, please.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.529
- Darcy.
- It'll be fun. Come on.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.906
Are you always this obnoxious?

08:53.074 --> 08:55.867
Ha-ha-ha.
- Yes, I am. Does that surprise you?

09:01.624 --> 09:05.794
Wow. You really don't notice
the way women look at you.

09:06.462 --> 09:08.004
You're funny.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.422
I'm not that funny.

09:09.590 --> 09:13.301
You're right. You were much funnier
in law school.

09:16.639 --> 09:20.141
God, if we could do anything, anything,
wake up tomorrow and do anything...

09:20.309 --> 09:21.726
...be anything, what would you do?

09:21.894 --> 09:24.062
- What would you be?
- Rap superstar.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.231
Come on, seriously.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.316
I'd be a teacher.

09:28.484 --> 09:29.985
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.072
Yeah, I always wanted to teach.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.491
You know, maybe start with high school.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.201
Coach the soccer team.

09:38.369 --> 09:42.205
So why aren't we?
Doing what we really wanna do?

09:42.373 --> 09:43.999
Well, I don't know about you...

09:44.166 --> 09:47.460
...but doing what I wanna do
has never been much of a factor.

09:47.628 --> 09:51.464
It's more like what I'm expected to do.

09:52.383 --> 09:53.633
Yes.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.594
Exactly.

10:00.224 --> 10:02.350
Wow. We're really flipping her out.

10:03.185 --> 10:05.979
She can't imagine
what you're doing here with me.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.523
Hot people are supposed to be
with hot people.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.652
- Excuse me.
- Dex. Shh!

10:12.820 --> 10:14.738
You're making
my girlfriend uncomfortable.

10:14.905 --> 10:15.989
- Dex. Stop it.
- What?

10:16.157 --> 10:19.117
Oh, my God. Ha-ha-ha.

10:19.702 --> 10:23.121
Oh. Now I remember why I had
such a crush on you in law school.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.331
No, you didn't.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.708
Course I did.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.378
Oh, come on. You knew.

10:47.396 --> 10:51.691
Two stops. Tenth and Second,
then down to Tribeca.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.078
I'm sorry.

11:03.245 --> 11:05.288
I don't know why I...

11:06.332 --> 11:08.291
I was just a...

11:25.309 --> 11:28.937
Yeah, all right.
I'm thinking more like one stop.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.792
Rach? Rachel?

11:52.336 --> 11:54.045
Rach.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.716
Rachel, pick up.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.552
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.095
Oh, my God.

12:02.263 --> 12:05.849
- Rachel. Rach.
- Oh, my God. What did I do?

12:06.016 --> 12:09.102
- I'm panicking.
- Dex never came home.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.478
Oh, no.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.982
- Listen to me.
- Dex never came home and I don't...

12:15.901 --> 12:17.318
Fourteen missed calls.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.655
Oh, my God! Wait! Don't be naked!

12:20.823 --> 12:21.823
What...?

12:25.286 --> 12:28.163
- Should I answer it?
- What? No! No, no. Don't...

12:28.330 --> 12:30.457
Oh, shit!

12:30.624 --> 12:32.292
- Pants. What?
- I should answer.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.503
- Why isn't anyone answering?
- Don't answer the phone.

12:35.671 --> 12:37.672
- I'll just say...
- Pick up the phone!

12:37.840 --> 12:39.257
- What?
- Rach.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.759
I don't know.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.678
It's an emergency,
and I think Dex is cheating on me.

12:43.846 --> 12:47.974
And I know it sounds so crazy, but,
hot people, they get cheated on sometimes.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.519
- What do we do?
- Rachel.

12:51.687 --> 12:55.356
It'll be okay. It's gonna be okay.
We'll figure it out.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.651
I'll tell her I was with Marcus.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.695
God, I'm such a terrible person.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.030
What did I do?

13:02.198 --> 13:03.573
I mean, not just to her, but to you.

13:03.741 --> 13:08.286
Rachel, stop. It wasn't just you.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.540
Rachel, I...

13:17.713 --> 13:19.422
I better go.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.647
- Hello?
- Rach, where the hell have you been?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.482
Dex didn't come home last night.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.526
- Hello?
- Oh, my God.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.194
- Rachel.
- Yes, I heard you.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.904
He didn't come home last night.

13:43.072 --> 13:46.074
He better have been hit by a car
or in jail or something.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.408
Darcy, don't say that.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.910
Do you think he's cheating?

13:49.078 --> 13:50.662
No.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.916
- He loves you.
- I know he loves me, obviously.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.251
But where the hell is he?

13:56.418 --> 14:00.046
Did you see him last night? At the bar?
Did you see him when you left the bar?

14:00.214 --> 14:01.256
Oh, yeah.

14:01.423 --> 14:06.219
Uh, he was with Marcus.
They were, uh, watching a game.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.929
A game? At 2 in the morning?

14:09.223 --> 14:13.184
It was something European.
Oh, cricket, maybe.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.394
Cricket?

14:15.771 --> 14:16.771
Oh, my God. It's him.

14:16.939 --> 14:20.483
I'm gonna see about this cricket crap.
I'll call you right back.

14:22.736 --> 14:26.155
Cricket. Cricket?

14:52.933 --> 14:55.184
You don't happen to have
four extra pens, do you?

14:55.352 --> 14:57.395
Oh, I do, actually. I brought a bunch.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.567
You're making fun of me.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.486
No, I'm impressed.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.239
You're making me feel
really inadequate right now.

15:11.285 --> 15:14.203
I'm Professor Dennis Zigman
and this is Torts.

15:14.371 --> 15:19.167
Never introduce
a contingency in your answer.

15:20.002 --> 15:25.673
A supposed tortfeasor may be argued
to have committed a tortious act...

15:26.091 --> 15:27.842
...when four conditions have been met.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.386
Each is necessary.
None is, in itself, sufficient.

15:30.554 --> 15:35.558
There must be a duty or obligation.
This duty must have been breached.

15:35.726 --> 15:40.104
- This breach must have caused damage.
- What about you?

15:40.272 --> 15:41.522
Duty, breach, causation.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.524
That's okay. I'll just listen.

15:43.692 --> 15:44.943
Damage.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.697
Thank you.

15:50.991 --> 15:53.785
Duty, breach, causation, damage.

15:53.953 --> 15:57.121
Now this duty is not a statutory duty.

15:57.998 --> 16:03.044
The breach. The breach may be
in the form of negligence.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.234
- Darcy.
- It's Dex.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.945
I borrowed her phone.

16:29.113 --> 16:35.034
Um, I just wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

16:35.202 --> 16:38.830
Oh. Yeah, I'm fine.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.581
Are you okay?

16:40.749 --> 16:42.291
I, um...

16:42.459 --> 16:43.751
Hey. Who are you talking to?

16:44.670 --> 16:45.920
It's Rachel.

16:46.088 --> 16:49.757
Oh! Hey. Sorry.
Totally forgot to call you back.

16:49.925 --> 16:51.884
Yeah, no. Is everything okay?

16:52.052 --> 16:55.263
No, it's fine. He just got drunk
and passed out at Marcus'. Whatever.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.890
- Wish her happy birthday.
- Oh, my God. Happy birthday.

16:58.058 --> 17:02.186
- Thanks. So everything's okay with Dex?
- Yeah, yeah.

17:02.354 --> 17:06.733
Um, yeah. Yeah.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.527
Except he got a little weird...

17:09.694 --> 17:12.530
...and acted really guilty
and said we have to have a talk.

17:14.074 --> 17:15.282
Talk about what?

17:15.451 --> 17:17.910
I don't know. Whatever.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.913
I gotta go. Kiss, kiss, kiss.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.290
Wait, can I just talk to Dex real quick?

17:34.636 --> 17:36.804
Because the dress I picked was perfect.

17:36.972 --> 17:40.475
Unless this one's even more perfect.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.230
Darcy, you look incredible.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.233
Wow. Wow.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.827
She's having her bridal moment.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.670
Hey, Darce. You okay?

18:10.589 --> 18:13.508
- You okay, Darce?
- No, I'm fine. I'm just...

18:13.675 --> 18:15.676
I wanna cry on the day...

18:15.844 --> 18:20.223
...so I wanna check my mascaras,
make sure it doesn't run...

18:20.390 --> 18:23.184
...so I'm trying out
all these different ones.

18:28.023 --> 18:31.609
My mascara. Is it running?

18:33.028 --> 18:36.864
I wish I could cry more.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.659
Can we get a bigger train?

18:46.458 --> 18:47.500
Shh!

18:48.377 --> 18:49.627
Sorry.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.839
Duty, breach, causation...

18:54.842 --> 18:55.967
- Oh, jeez.
- Hold on.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.427
- What am I missing? What am I missing?
- Damages.

18:58.595 --> 18:59.720
Oh, shit.

19:01.056 --> 19:03.015
Sorry. I'm sorry.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.644
Here.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.063
Use a mnemonic.

19:09.231 --> 19:13.234
D, B, C, D.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.240
Deliver by Christmas Day.

19:20.742 --> 19:23.035
Don't blame Cameron Diaz.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.999
- This isn't even that funny, is it?
- No.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.584
It's not funny at all.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.559
How about when all of this is over...

19:48.604 --> 19:51.689
...Dex buys celebratory dinner?

19:53.775 --> 19:55.651
Oh! Yeah.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.528
Sure.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.982
- Actually, I spun the bottle.
- Yes.

20:35.150 --> 20:36.484
- I would spin the bottle.
- Ha-ha-ha.

20:36.652 --> 20:40.821
And, well, she manipulated the bottle
so that it landed on me, of course.

20:40.989 --> 20:43.532
- And so we go in the closet.
- Ha-ha-ha.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.577
But it was one of the best kisses
I've ever had.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.204
Wow.

20:50.082 --> 20:55.169
- And...
- And, um, my first kiss was on a golf course.

20:55.337 --> 20:59.465
- Okay.
- In the middle of the night, and I was 13.

20:59.883 --> 21:01.634
- Ha-ha-ha.
- That's...

21:01.802 --> 21:03.511
Crashing.

21:06.848 --> 21:10.685
Oh, I don't know. He's okay-looking.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.938
Dex, this is Darcy. Darcy, this is Dex.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.148
You've been talking about him
for nine months.

21:16.316 --> 21:18.025
Well, he's been
a very great study partner.

21:18.193 --> 21:21.904
Wow. You two, lighten up.
Your tarts are over.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.614
- Torts. Th...
- Whatever.

21:23.782 --> 21:24.949
Excuse me.

21:25.117 --> 21:29.328
Uh, could we have six shots of tequila,
por favor?

21:29.496 --> 21:33.874
So games, fun, let's get this party started.
Truth or dare.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.293
Darcy.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.545
It'll be fun. Come on.

21:40.882 --> 21:43.551
Okay, fine. I'll start. Dare.

21:43.719 --> 21:47.388
Ask Rachel out on a real date
instead of whatever this is.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.685
Darce. We're just friends.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.565
Fine. Then ask me out.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.194
Hey, don't look at me.

22:04.364 --> 22:08.242
- Who are you?
- Who am I? I, counselor, am fun.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.953
Which you look like you could use
a lot more of.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.580
- Oh, is that so?
Mm-hm.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.915
Yeah, it is fun, so I'm willing to share.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.418
- Are you always this obnoxious?
- Ha-ha-ha.

22:17.586 --> 22:20.087
- Yes. I am. Does that surprise you?
- Yeah.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.965
Surprise me? No. You seem like trouble.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.175
Trouble?

22:26.261 --> 22:27.887
Rachel.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.181
Did you hear me? Rachel?

22:32.559 --> 22:35.353
Veil, no veil?

22:38.106 --> 22:39.482
Hmm?

22:41.943 --> 22:44.779
Veil.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.200
Oh, come on, Rachel. I mean, really.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.703
You're 30, you can't afford to be picky.

22:53.121 --> 22:57.416
Oh, my God. I can't believe I forgot to
tell you. Guess who thinks you're hot.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.960
Marcus.

23:00.128 --> 23:01.128
Oh.

23:01.296 --> 23:03.714
Dex's friend, Marcus.
He was at your party.

23:04.591 --> 23:07.134
- Yeah, no.
- What?

23:07.302 --> 23:09.470
Oh, my God. You're like...

23:09.638 --> 23:11.389
Whatever. So guess what I did.

23:11.598 --> 23:15.559
I convinced Marcus to take
the last bedroom in the Hamptons house.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.812
- Darcy.
- What? It'll be so fun.

23:17.979 --> 23:20.439
It'll be like
your own little live-in boy toy.

23:20.607 --> 23:24.318
Actually, I'm gonna have to work
most weekends.

23:26.279 --> 23:28.572
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.157
Can't believe I'm doing this.

23:30.325 --> 23:34.328
Oh, stop it. It's one weekend.
It's gonna be beautiful. You can write.

23:34.496 --> 23:35.746
What are you talking about?

23:35.914 --> 23:39.083
The Hamptons are like a zombie movie
directed by Ralph Lauren.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.627
And I won't be doing a lot of writing...

23:41.795 --> 23:45.005
...seeing as how
I'm your sexual chaperone from Marco.

23:45.173 --> 23:46.674
- Marcus.
- Marky.

23:46.842 --> 23:47.967
- Marcus.
- Doesn't matter.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.474
- No.
- Yikes.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.518
No, please tell me he's not coming.

23:57.686 --> 24:00.229
- Good night, everybody.
- Darcy, be nice.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.775
What's with the backpack, Ethan?
Like 1982.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.944
- You're lame.
- You're lame.

24:07.112 --> 24:11.949
- Hey. What's up, buddy?
- Hey, look who it is. It's this guy.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.034
Dude. Three chicks, three dudes.

24:14.202 --> 24:15.828
- Hi.
- Thanks, bro.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.539
- Get on in there, doggie.
- Don't touch me, though.

24:18.707 --> 24:22.042
- Here... That's all right. I got it.
- No, it's okay. I got it. Thank you.

24:22.210 --> 24:23.544
I got that one.

24:23.712 --> 24:26.422
By the way, Ethan,
you're sleeping in a little girl's room.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.132
Oh, great. You're gross.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.801
Pay the toll. Pay the toll.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.970
- I'll get one later.
- Sun waiting for us!

24:33.138 --> 24:34.889
- You ready? You ready?
- Whoo!

24:35.056 --> 24:37.475
The Hamptons, baby, huh?

25:20.268 --> 25:23.103
Oh, my God, you guys.
Welcome.

25:59.849 --> 26:01.725
Oh, my God. Honey. Honey.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.352
- Save it for the honeymoon.
- Yes.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.479
I'd like to make a toast.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.314
Here...

26:08.149 --> 26:12.069
...is to my last and best summer
of my former life...

26:12.279 --> 26:15.573
...before I become Mrs. Dexter Thaler.

26:15.740 --> 26:20.244
May we all come up here as often
as possible before Labor Day...

26:20.412 --> 26:23.831
...and spend the summer full of sun,
fun, drinking, partying...

26:23.999 --> 26:25.499
We should do some shots.

26:26.876 --> 26:28.002
Cheers.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.670
- Cheers.
- Cheers, buddy.

26:29.838 --> 26:34.174
Cheers. Look in the eyes.
Look in the eyes, everybody. In the eyes.

26:34.342 --> 26:36.135
Bad luck if you don't do it.

26:36.303 --> 26:39.597
Dex, Rachel, look in each other's eyes.

26:39.764 --> 26:40.848
Let's go out!

26:41.016 --> 26:42.433
Let's go to the Jetty.

27:01.703 --> 27:03.203
- You gotta stop staring.
- What?

27:03.371 --> 27:04.705
I wasn't.

27:04.914 --> 27:07.666
What?
I'm talking about cuckoo bird over there.

27:07.834 --> 27:10.628
Look at her. She's just a little gremlin.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.130
She's like some weird animal.

27:13.298 --> 27:16.008
She's like a freaking circus animal.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.010
- What is that?
- Oh, just stop it.

27:18.178 --> 27:20.971
She's a perfectly normal woman
who made the great mistake...

27:21.139 --> 27:24.016
...of thinking some man wanted her
when all he wanted was sex.

27:24.184 --> 27:27.895
- Thanks, Oprah. I don't need...
- Just go talk to her.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.898
Okay. I should totally do that.

27:32.901 --> 27:33.901
Not now, I'm not.

27:40.575 --> 27:42.326
Oh, oh, oh!

27:42.494 --> 27:44.203
What's up? How you doing?

27:44.621 --> 27:47.247
- Ooh! Hey!
- Too much? Too much? All right.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.337
How you doing?

27:53.505 --> 27:56.090
Could I get a Maker's on the rocks, please?
Thank you.

27:56.257 --> 27:57.508
You're like a shark.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.594
That kind of hurts my
feelings a little bit.

28:00.804 --> 28:02.596
I'm actually a pretty sensitive guy.

28:02.764 --> 28:06.225
- Oh, really?
- Once, when I was 9 years old...

28:06.434 --> 28:08.102
...I saved the life of a chipmunk.

28:08.269 --> 28:09.520
A chipmunk.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.773
He fell out of our tree and almost died.
He didn't know what to do.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.274
He couldn't move his legs.

28:14.442 --> 28:18.070
So I built a tiny little splint
for his tiny, little broken leg.

28:18.613 --> 28:20.447
And I carried him around
in a BabyBjÃ¶rn.

28:20.615 --> 28:24.284
And all the kids in my neighborhood,
they laughed. They made fun of me.

28:24.452 --> 28:27.621
They threw rocks at me. But I didn't care.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.082
- You know why?
- Why?

28:30.250 --> 28:33.293
Because all I saw was this little fur ball
that needed love.

28:34.254 --> 28:37.881
That's really sweet.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.467
I know.

28:41.386 --> 28:46.181
So next time you wanna call somebody
a shark, just remember the chipmunk.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.144
All right.

28:50.311 --> 28:55.858
How about we go outside
and get a little fresh air? What?

28:56.025 --> 28:58.777
- No. Sorry. Not my thing.
- Ha-ha-ha.

28:58.945 --> 29:00.571
- Not your thing?
- Not my thing.

29:00.739 --> 29:01.989
Okay.

29:06.494 --> 29:08.662
You know what? Why not?

29:12.417 --> 29:14.084
God, I'm good.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.171
I don't know what you're talking about.

29:17.338 --> 29:20.466
- But where did the guy end up?
- We never spoke to him again.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.645
Bedtime, baby.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.486
Yeah, you two should go.

29:41.946 --> 29:44.865
You know what, hon?
I'm actually not that tired.

29:48.119 --> 29:49.703
Good.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.541
Yeah, well, good night, man.

29:54.709 --> 29:55.709
What a great day, huh?

29:56.169 --> 29:58.378
Come here. Love you.

29:58.546 --> 29:59.880
Come on.

30:00.048 --> 30:01.799
- So hot.
- Good night, Marcus.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.721
Night, you two.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.974
- Have fun.
- Good night.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.699
Alone at last.

30:31.162 --> 30:33.080
Here we go. Yeah.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.123
Oh, Dex.

30:35.750 --> 30:36.792
Dex.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.088
- Is that...?
- It's a cat.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.257
Oh, that was no cat.

30:45.760 --> 30:49.012
I'm really digging the ambience
in this house.

30:54.143 --> 30:57.187
- Hey. Hey.
- Oh.

30:58.356 --> 31:02.067
- It's so, like, crazy out there.
- Is it?

31:02.235 --> 31:06.113
Um, do you think maybe I could, uh,
could sleep in here? In this room?

31:06.614 --> 31:09.575
No. Nope. Nope.

31:10.076 --> 31:12.327
Because it's...

31:13.246 --> 31:14.746
Claire, I'm...

31:14.914 --> 31:18.917
I'm really sorry. I should've talked
to you about this before.

31:19.085 --> 31:21.628
I'm just... I can tell you from in there.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.505
Um...

31:25.633 --> 31:29.136
I think I'm gay.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.680
That came out wrong. I'm definitely gay.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.849
I'm really gay. I'm just figuring it out.

31:34.017 --> 31:36.143
- Oh, my God.
- This weekend's been a lot.

31:36.311 --> 31:40.564
I'm a little... Feeling vulnerable,
excited, liberated. Things...

31:40.732 --> 31:42.149
Phew. Got a lot going on.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.610
All these things I'm dealing with,
it's just...

31:44.777 --> 31:47.279
There's not enough room for all of it
and you.

31:47.447 --> 31:48.989
- Okay.
- You know?

31:49.157 --> 31:50.532
- So...
- Okay.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.452
All right. Thanks for being cool with it.

31:54.954 --> 31:55.996
I accept.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.916
- You accept what now?
- I accept the challenge.

31:59.083 --> 32:02.628
I accept the challenge
of being your partner in this journey.

32:02.795 --> 32:05.422
No. You're not getting it.
I don't need you as a partner.

32:05.590 --> 32:08.175
I need another partner.
I need, like, a guy partner.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.177
Like, dudes, maybe a lot of them.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.554
Yes. We're gonna work through this.

32:12.722 --> 32:15.307
There's no working through it.
It's not a curable thing.

32:15.475 --> 32:16.975
This I got.

32:17.518 --> 32:20.020
- We start tomorrow.
- We're not... What are we starting?

32:20.188 --> 32:23.649
- Yeah.
- What? Claire. Claire!

32:23.816 --> 32:25.359
Yeah.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.696
Yeah! Yeah!

32:35.203 --> 32:37.329
- Well, I'm out of here.
- What?

32:37.497 --> 32:38.830
You're leaving?

32:39.499 --> 32:42.376
- No.
- My boss called. I have to go in.

32:42.543 --> 32:45.837
Tell him you can't. What an ass.

32:46.005 --> 32:48.006
Ass face.

32:49.842 --> 32:52.386
- I know.
- Will you make her stay?

32:53.054 --> 32:54.638
Rachel, you really should stay.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.890
You're gonna miss them shooting
another porno.

32:57.058 --> 32:59.142
You are obviously
still so in love with me.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.352
Obviously.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.814
Do we have the number for a taxi?
I need to get to the Jitney.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.066
It's okay.

33:06.567 --> 33:07.609
I could take you.

33:07.777 --> 33:10.070
Yeah. Honey will take you.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.323
Well, there you go.

33:27.463 --> 33:30.048
You don't really have to go, do you?

33:32.552 --> 33:37.264
I'm sorry. Can we, um...?
Can we just forget this happened?

33:38.975 --> 33:40.434
Okay.

33:43.104 --> 33:45.105
We'll forget it happened.

33:45.273 --> 33:47.232
Good. Why did it happen?

33:49.235 --> 33:50.736
Why did you kiss me?

33:53.072 --> 33:54.114
Yeah...

33:56.451 --> 33:57.451
We shouldn't...

33:58.578 --> 34:00.037
You were having wedding jitters.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.080
And I was emotional
about turning 30.

34:02.248 --> 34:04.583
- We were both really drunk.
- I wasn't that drunk.

34:06.961 --> 34:08.128
What?

34:09.297 --> 34:11.130
I wasn't that drunk.

34:13.634 --> 34:16.303
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't even...
- No, it was just a mistake.

34:16.471 --> 34:17.512
It was a big mistake.

34:17.679 --> 34:20.474
Yeah, you know what?
It was, ha, a big mistake.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.382
So how was the rest of the weekend?

34:54.550 --> 34:56.967
I just had the best time
with your boyfriend, Marco.

34:57.136 --> 34:58.762
- Marcus.
- Doesn't matter.

34:59.806 --> 35:01.431
Everybody was okay with me leaving?

35:01.599 --> 35:04.226
You know, Darcy?
Dex? Anybody say anything?

35:04.393 --> 35:07.771
Well, we all had a good cry, but then...
No. No one cared. Why?

35:07.939 --> 35:08.980
Nothing.

35:09.857 --> 35:12.442
I'm having dinner with Darcy.
She said it was important.

35:12.610 --> 35:15.362
It's important?
Oh, my God, should I be there?

35:15.655 --> 35:17.072
Ha.

35:18.199 --> 35:19.241
Oh, that's great.

35:29.502 --> 35:31.211
Just because we didn't...

35:33.506 --> 35:34.631
Rachel is here.

35:35.049 --> 35:36.341
Oh. Rach.

35:36.759 --> 35:39.010
- Rach, we're back here.
- A bit short.

35:42.348 --> 35:43.974
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.183
Do you wanna sit down?

35:45.351 --> 35:49.354
No, that's okay. I just... I thought that
we were having dinner alone, Darce.

35:49.522 --> 35:50.647
- Right.
- So did I.

35:50.815 --> 35:55.068
We're not. There's something the three
of us need to talk about that's important.

35:55.236 --> 35:57.237
Let me get a chair. Can I steal this?

35:58.573 --> 36:01.575
Scoot over just a smidge. Thank you.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.997
Okay.

36:12.795 --> 36:16.047
There's something going on here,
and I think we all know what it is.

36:19.218 --> 36:21.261
I know there's something going on.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.849
I've been noticing this for a while.

36:26.475 --> 36:29.519
And I read in Cosmopolitan magazine toda...
Well, I skimmed it.

36:29.687 --> 36:35.525
And it said it's normal for the best friend
and the fiancÃ© to be...

36:35.693 --> 36:38.945
...upset about losing the attention
of the bride.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.743
That is what's going on here, right?

36:46.621 --> 36:47.621
Actually...

36:47.788 --> 36:49.247
- Guilty.
- Yeah.

36:49.415 --> 36:52.292
- That's it. That's it.
- Okay, all right. Let's get over it now.

36:52.460 --> 36:55.545
Let's move on from this,
because there are no third wheels.

36:55.713 --> 36:59.466
I love you both.

36:59.634 --> 37:00.926
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:01.093 --> 37:04.304
Yes, thank you for dinner.

37:05.765 --> 37:08.225
So did you and Marcus do it?

37:08.392 --> 37:09.893
- Darcy.
Heh-heh-heh.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.520
It's a legitimate question.

37:12.688 --> 37:13.772
Did you?

37:15.024 --> 37:16.483
- Tell me.
- No.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.151
Was he a good kisser at least?

37:18.319 --> 37:19.986
- Will you leave her alone?
- Come on.

37:20.154 --> 37:23.657
Shush. This is between me
and my best girlfriend.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.160
Well?

37:27.578 --> 37:28.828
- Was he?
- Hmm?

37:30.498 --> 37:34.251
I knew it. I knew it. Will you tell Dex
he doesn't know you at all?

37:34.418 --> 37:38.672
He was like, "She's not into him.
Why would she be into him?"

37:39.423 --> 37:41.174
I just...

37:42.343 --> 37:46.179
- I think you two are different. That's all.
- So?

37:46.347 --> 37:48.556
So what? We're different.

37:48.975 --> 37:51.851
If people fell in love based on similarities,
the two of you would be a couple.

37:52.019 --> 37:53.436
I'm gonna get a taxi.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.855
- Okay.
- Meet me up front.

37:56.023 --> 37:57.774
Are you gonna leave me?

38:02.947 --> 38:05.365
Okay. Maid of honor favor.

38:05.866 --> 38:09.035
You have to see this '90s cover band
with me tomorrow night.

38:09.203 --> 38:10.370
For the wedding.

38:10.871 --> 38:14.374
You have to. It's the only time
they're playing and Dex loves the band.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.751
- I'm slammed at work.
- Promised him I'd go.

38:16.919 --> 38:21.673
He's working. You're coming. Please?
You have way better taste than me.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.508
Than I. It's "than I."

38:23.676 --> 38:25.552
- You have better taste than I.
- Than I do.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.470
Sounds weird.

38:27.722 --> 38:29.222
Fine. Ahem.

38:30.057 --> 38:31.891
When do I ever say no to you?

38:37.231 --> 38:41.568
How's it gonna be

38:41.736 --> 38:45.905
When you don't know me anymore?

38:46.073 --> 38:47.741
Hey. Where are you?

38:47.908 --> 38:49.409
Oh, something came up.

38:49.577 --> 38:50.744
Wait, you're not coming?

38:50.911 --> 38:53.496
Well, I... Ow!

38:54.582 --> 38:58.585
Um, why don't you just listen to a couple
songs and call me after? I gotta go.

39:00.504 --> 39:04.758
How's it gonna be

39:04.925 --> 39:11.848
When you don't know me anymore?

39:12.016 --> 39:16.561
How's it gonna be

39:16.729 --> 39:36.748
How's it gonna be?

39:43.631 --> 39:47.217
Step out the front door
Like a ghost into the fog

39:47.385 --> 39:53.139
Where no one notices the contrast
Of white on white

39:53.307 --> 39:58.770
In between the moon and you
Angels get a better view

39:58.938 --> 40:00.730
I can't believe she sent you here.

40:01.190 --> 40:02.440
- It's fine.
- No.

40:02.900 --> 40:06.069
This is not fine.

40:10.741 --> 40:13.326
How come you never told me
how you felt in law school?

40:15.204 --> 40:18.998
Dex, I never should have
said anything. I'm...

40:19.667 --> 40:22.252
I just wish I would've known.

40:23.504 --> 40:24.671
What do you mean?

40:26.966 --> 40:30.677
Rachel, you were all I ever thought about
in law school.

40:32.346 --> 40:35.265
Did you really not know that?

40:40.062 --> 40:41.521
Why are you saying this to me?

40:41.689 --> 40:43.106
- Rachel...
- Wait, don't.

40:43.732 --> 40:45.692
- Please, don't.
- Rachel.

40:45.860 --> 40:50.947
This is not wedding jitters. It never was.

40:52.366 --> 40:58.830
I just...
I can't stop thinking about you...

41:01.292 --> 41:03.376
...and I don't know what to do.

41:05.588 --> 41:07.630
Rachel, look at me.

41:08.424 --> 41:10.383
Look at me.

41:12.803 --> 41:17.724
If you feel the same way about me,
tell me now.

41:18.601 --> 41:20.310
Please.

41:21.061 --> 41:23.062
Just tell me now.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.067
I can't.

41:29.945 --> 41:36.159
It's too late.

41:38.162 --> 41:41.498
We all look the same

42:19.078 --> 42:21.329
I do feel the same way.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.665
I wish I didn't.

42:24.291 --> 42:25.959
But I do.

42:54.113 --> 42:59.325
Hey. I can't stop
thinking about what just happened.

42:59.660 --> 43:01.786
God, this is crazy.

43:01.954 --> 43:07.500
But I just wanna make sure you come
to the Hamptons this weekend.

43:08.294 --> 43:13.047
I, um, hope to see you there. Okay.

43:24.393 --> 43:26.185
Lunchtime!

43:31.817 --> 43:34.360
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:35.029 --> 43:37.363
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

43:37.531 --> 43:39.198
Ha-ha-ha. Hi.

43:40.534 --> 43:43.161
- I, uh, forgot something.
- Ugh.

43:43.954 --> 43:46.247
- What a dramatic day.
- It is.

43:47.041 --> 43:49.876
Oh. Heh-heh-heh.

43:50.044 --> 43:51.377
Why are you wearing that?

43:51.754 --> 43:55.381
What? Why shouldn't gays have
the same rights as we do?

43:55.549 --> 43:58.259
I'm gonna go grab a beer.
Do you guys want anything?

43:58.427 --> 43:59.844
I'll have a beer.

44:00.012 --> 44:01.554
I agree, I just...

44:01.972 --> 44:03.681
Hey, Rach.

44:04.058 --> 44:08.394
I'm sorry about that.
Uh, I was just thinking...

44:22.826 --> 44:24.243
No peppers, right, baby?

44:24.411 --> 44:26.579
- When did you get here?
- Uh, this morning.

44:26.747 --> 44:29.832
I didn't invite you back another weekend.
So why are you here?

44:30.501 --> 44:34.253
Because I love you
and I can't stand to be away from you.

44:34.421 --> 44:35.922
And, also, my apartment flooded.

44:36.090 --> 44:38.383
Really? It flooded? That's so weird.
I don't care.

44:38.550 --> 44:39.801
- Darcy.
- That's crazy.

44:39.968 --> 44:43.096
Be nice to him. He's going through
something very difficult.

44:43.263 --> 44:46.933
Thank you. Well, no, it was just
the apartment flooding is the only thing.

44:48.560 --> 44:50.520
I think I need a wet nap.

44:50.688 --> 44:52.105
You do.

44:54.108 --> 44:55.733
Good spread.

44:55.943 --> 44:57.443
Spaghetti.

45:02.241 --> 45:04.367
We're allowed to have guests, right?

45:04.535 --> 45:06.077
Is there any vodka?

45:08.372 --> 45:11.124
Mom, don't worry.

45:11.959 --> 45:16.295
Yeah, no, it shouldn't be a problem.
Okay, well, I'll call you tomorrow.

45:16.714 --> 45:18.798
It's all gonna be fine, Mom.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.509
I love you too.

45:26.140 --> 45:27.223
That your mom?

45:29.852 --> 45:31.436
Is she not doing well again?

45:31.854 --> 45:36.149
She's actually getting better.
She's so excited about the wedding.

45:37.901 --> 45:40.194
Right. Ahem.

45:43.407 --> 45:45.658
You know, when I was a kid...

45:47.578 --> 45:51.831
...and her depression got really bad,
my father made sure he wasn't around...

45:52.332 --> 45:54.542
...so I'd just try to cheer her up.

45:55.502 --> 45:57.503
The worst part was...

45:57.671 --> 46:02.842
...I actually was afraid that if I couldn't
make her happy, I'd lose her.

46:04.511 --> 46:06.262
That's a good reason to be afraid.

46:10.601 --> 46:16.189
Dex! FedEx! It's our proofs
for our wedding invites! Come see!

46:17.065 --> 46:19.692
I'm sorry we haven't had any time to talk.

46:33.457 --> 46:35.208
Nice jeans, dude.

46:35.375 --> 46:36.501
Nice hair, bro.

46:36.668 --> 46:38.878
You wanna go
dip your toes in the water with me?

46:41.048 --> 46:44.634
I think she's asleep. Or dead.

46:44.802 --> 46:46.511
Well, I'm gonna go.

46:55.729 --> 46:58.481
- Something tells me you're not kidding.
- I'm not.

47:02.945 --> 47:04.695
Ha-ha-ha.

47:04.863 --> 47:10.535
That's, like, the fakest laugh.
What's wrong with you lately?

47:11.161 --> 47:13.496
I'm sorry. I'm just a little tense.

47:13.664 --> 47:15.289
Tense.

47:17.209 --> 47:21.504
I love you, baby,
even when you're tense.

47:22.130 --> 47:23.464
What are you doing?

47:23.632 --> 47:24.715
What do you mean?

47:24.883 --> 47:26.592
What am I doing?

47:27.135 --> 47:29.262
Don't even think about it.

47:30.889 --> 47:33.182
What did I say, huh?

47:33.684 --> 47:36.435
Darcy, you're so dead.

47:54.621 --> 47:57.540
When I need to get away
I turn it up

47:57.708 --> 48:01.460
I let it play
Let the DJ show me the way of the player

48:01.628 --> 48:03.170
Until I'm feeling as good as

48:03.338 --> 48:07.383
Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh

48:07.551 --> 48:10.177
Oh, oh, oh

48:10.345 --> 48:12.972
We came here to party

48:13.140 --> 48:15.099
- My mom didn't know what I was doing.
- Oh, oh, oh

48:15.267 --> 48:19.270
Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh

48:19.438 --> 48:21.814
We came here to party

48:21.982 --> 48:24.567
Oh, oh, oh

48:24.735 --> 48:26.277
- Get away from me.
- Oh, oh, oh

48:26.445 --> 48:29.989
Oh, oh, oh

48:30.157 --> 48:34.160
So I built this tiny little splint
for his tiny little broken leg.

48:34.328 --> 48:38.039
And I had to do CPR on him. You couldn't
push hard. You had to just blow it...

48:38.206 --> 48:39.665
- I need him. I'm sorry.
- Oh!

48:39.833 --> 48:41.250
Oh, God! I need you.

48:41.418 --> 48:43.419
Aah! Yeah!

48:45.756 --> 48:47.089
Bring it back to me

48:47.257 --> 48:49.508
Hit the players' club
For about a month or two

48:49.676 --> 48:50.760
Yeah, Rachel!

48:50.928 --> 48:53.721
I found you
Ms. New Booty

48:53.889 --> 48:54.931
Do it, girl!

48:55.098 --> 48:59.143
I'm here for you, baby! Whatever you need!
Whatever you need, baby!

48:59.311 --> 49:02.355
Put a tan on it
Then see what it do

49:02.522 --> 49:03.856
Get it right
Get it right, get it tight

49:04.024 --> 49:05.608
Oh, yeah.

49:06.026 --> 49:07.526
No.

49:07.694 --> 49:09.236
Give him your back. Give him your back.

49:09.404 --> 49:11.656
Girl, I don't need you
But you need me

49:11.823 --> 49:14.200
Take it off, let it flop
Shake it freely

49:15.535 --> 49:19.080
I let 'em tell itself And you ain't
gotta sell, girl, it sell itself

49:19.247 --> 49:21.123
Like nothing else
Yeah, I'm a country boy

49:21.291 --> 49:22.792
Yeah.

49:24.044 --> 49:27.713
Ain't life grand?
Live it up, daddy

49:31.510 --> 49:33.386
Yeah, get in there.

49:36.056 --> 49:37.098
Are you all right?

49:37.265 --> 49:39.225
Yeah, no, I just think I pulled something.

49:39.393 --> 49:41.143
Your vagina?

49:41.311 --> 49:43.396
No, I didn't pull my vagina.

49:43.563 --> 49:49.402
- Ha-ha-ha. I'm just kidding.
- I just pulled near my vagina.

49:50.904 --> 49:52.196
She's fine, she's fine.

50:31.570 --> 50:35.114
Now I know how many flowers it takes
for you to call me back when you're mad.

50:35.699 --> 50:37.491
Sorry. It just...

50:37.659 --> 50:41.662
Look, I know this weekend wasn't
what we had hoped it would be.

50:41.830 --> 50:43.873
No, it wasn't just this weekend.

50:44.041 --> 50:47.585
It's watching you with her.
And knowing what we're doing.

50:47.753 --> 50:50.379
What are we doing? It's just...

50:51.214 --> 50:54.842
It's hard to see you with her, Dex.

50:55.385 --> 50:57.970
I can't believe I'm saying these things.

50:58.805 --> 51:01.682
Rachel, what we need
is some time alone.

51:02.851 --> 51:04.435
Just the two of us.

51:04.603 --> 51:07.354
You know what,
next weekend is the Fourth of July.

51:07.522 --> 51:09.607
I'll say I have to work.

51:10.192 --> 51:11.984
And it'll be like a time-out.

51:12.486 --> 51:14.695
A time-out to see what this is...

51:14.863 --> 51:19.742
...without anyone or anything around us.

51:25.290 --> 51:26.332
What do you say?

51:28.627 --> 51:30.336
Gotta go. Call you back.

51:31.088 --> 51:33.923
Sorry. Started without you. Good God.
Who are those from?

51:34.883 --> 51:39.011
- Uh, Marcus.
- Really? Because they look expensive.

51:39.679 --> 51:41.263
- Should we go?
- Yes, we should.

51:41.431 --> 51:43.307
And that was him
on the phone too, right?

51:43.475 --> 51:45.518
- You doing good?
- Should we go?

51:46.394 --> 51:48.687
Yes, we should. There's a note.

51:49.356 --> 51:50.689
It's private. Come on.

51:50.857 --> 51:53.651
Come on.
I was just gonna check his spelling.

51:53.819 --> 51:56.195
- Heh.
- Rachel.

51:58.240 --> 52:00.533
Rachel, who are the flowers from?

52:03.870 --> 52:05.704
Do you want me to guess?

52:06.540 --> 52:08.207
Please don't.

52:13.046 --> 52:15.381
Please say something.

52:15.549 --> 52:20.386
I don't know what you want me to say.
I mean, I guess I'm impressed, actually.

52:20.554 --> 52:24.014
I didn't think you had it in you.
Him either.

52:24.808 --> 52:27.434
It's nothing to be proud of.

52:28.186 --> 52:29.770
Oh, my God, it's terrible.

52:29.938 --> 52:32.398
Why? Nobody's married yet.

52:32.566 --> 52:35.860
And, besides, sometimes good people
do bad things, right?

52:36.403 --> 52:39.905
And, hey, I could see you guys together.

52:43.285 --> 52:44.910
So, what's the plan?

52:45.078 --> 52:47.872
You gonna stay here,
spend Fourth of July weekend with him?

52:48.582 --> 52:53.919
He wants to spend some time together
to see what this thing is.

52:54.337 --> 52:55.671
And what do you want?

52:56.423 --> 53:00.885
I want not to want him.

53:01.845 --> 53:02.887
Is that true?

53:05.473 --> 53:07.266
I don't know.

53:09.186 --> 53:10.978
Well, I can tell you this.

53:11.438 --> 53:13.772
If the roles were reversed...

53:14.274 --> 53:16.025
...Darcy wouldn't even hesitate.

53:18.528 --> 53:20.446
Darcy, I really have to get back to work.

53:20.614 --> 53:22.573
What about these?

53:23.116 --> 53:24.950
Did you hear me?

53:25.410 --> 53:27.745
- Can I read you something?
- Can you read it fast?

53:27.913 --> 53:29.496
- It's my vows.
- I have to be...

53:35.003 --> 53:36.045
Sit.

53:37.297 --> 53:38.797
Ready?

53:39.674 --> 53:41.133
"Dex."

53:43.011 --> 53:44.803
Dex.

53:45.263 --> 53:50.768
"Our love is like the ocean.
Endless and deep, always flowing."

53:53.855 --> 53:55.940
It's awful? You hate it?

53:56.441 --> 53:58.317
I don't hate it. It's lovely.

54:00.320 --> 54:02.238
Oceans don't flow. Rivers flow.

54:02.864 --> 54:07.159
See, you're better at this than I am.
Help me.

54:07.327 --> 54:08.953
Right now?

54:09.120 --> 54:10.162
- Come on.
- Okay.

54:10.330 --> 54:11.830
Well, forget the ocean.

54:12.666 --> 54:13.749
Forget the ocean.

54:14.334 --> 54:17.419
Uh, tell him that...

54:17.587 --> 54:22.424
...when you're with him,
everything makes sense.

54:23.051 --> 54:24.635
Right?

54:25.053 --> 54:27.846
And he makes you giddy.

54:30.850 --> 54:32.559
And...

54:32.727 --> 54:35.145
...uh, tell him that...

54:37.190 --> 54:43.028
...he makes you the person you want to be,
instead of the person you are.

54:43.738 --> 54:45.906
And that...

54:47.575 --> 54:52.496
...uh, the idea of life without him is...

54:53.039 --> 54:57.918
...not only unbearable, it's unimaginable.

54:58.211 --> 55:00.045
Oh, my God.

55:00.213 --> 55:02.548
- Ha, ha. Hi.
- What's up?

55:02.716 --> 55:05.009
- How are you?
- I haven't seen you guys forever.

55:05.176 --> 55:07.803
- How's it going? What's happening?
- I know.

55:07.971 --> 55:09.513
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's Rachel.

55:09.681 --> 55:12.641
You remember Rachel.
My best friend from forever.

55:12.851 --> 55:15.644
I know, I'm getting...
I'm getting shoes for my wedding.

55:15.812 --> 55:18.105
- Can you believe it?
- No!

55:20.900 --> 55:22.359
Yes.

55:22.861 --> 55:25.904
If you're driving to the
beach, I hope you packed your patience...

55:26.072 --> 55:28.407
...because the roads are jammed, folks...

55:28.575 --> 55:33.245
...as New York City does its annual
disappearing act for the Fourth of July.

55:50.388 --> 55:52.765
- Who is it?
- It's Dex.

55:52.932 --> 55:54.558
Hi.

56:00.440 --> 56:01.982
Come on up.

56:05.403 --> 56:07.279
You know what,
I'm gonna come down there.

56:07.447 --> 56:08.447
I can come up.

56:08.615 --> 56:11.200
No, no, no. I'm coming down.

56:18.875 --> 56:20.292
Wow.

56:24.464 --> 56:27.132
Sorry. I'm... Ugh, I'm just a...

56:27.801 --> 56:28.967
- A wreck?
- Heh.

56:29.636 --> 56:31.387
Yes. Heh-heh-heh.

56:32.680 --> 56:34.973
- So shall we go?
- Yeah.

56:38.353 --> 56:41.146
Wow. It really is deserted.

56:41.314 --> 56:42.856
Yeah, it's just us.

56:46.361 --> 56:48.487
- Is that her? You can answer if you want.
- No.

56:48.655 --> 56:51.323
You know what,
I'm gonna turn this thing off.

57:02.210 --> 57:06.880
I'm sorry. I'm not... I just...
I'm not, uh, really comfortable.

57:08.299 --> 57:10.008
No, it's okay...

57:10.176 --> 57:15.764
...because this is already the best
weekend I've had in a long time.

57:22.355 --> 57:26.525
Do you remember that night when
we were studying for our Torts final?

57:26.693 --> 57:28.819
And you were laughing so hard?

57:29.988 --> 57:32.364
You know exactly what I'm talking about,
don't you?

57:32.532 --> 57:33.949
Yeah.

57:34.868 --> 57:39.204
Didn't you feel what I was feeling?

57:39.372 --> 57:41.290
I did.

57:43.209 --> 57:46.503
At least I was hoping
that's what you were feeling.

57:47.380 --> 57:51.008
Yeah, but, then,
that night when I met Darcy...

57:51.885 --> 57:54.011
...I actually thought you set us up.

57:54.179 --> 57:57.097
I just didn't think someone like you...

57:57.891 --> 58:00.225
...could ever like someone like me.

59:09.837 --> 59:12.047
That's a nice way to wake up.

59:12.632 --> 59:14.258
Good morning.

59:18.263 --> 59:19.972
I wanna tell you something.

59:20.765 --> 59:22.474
Tell me something.

59:29.440 --> 59:30.732
I love you.

59:32.694 --> 59:34.653
I love you, Rachel.

59:37.115 --> 59:39.491
I think I always have loved you.

59:51.212 --> 59:54.339
Imagine I'm holding your hand
right now.

59:54.799 --> 59:56.508
Okay.

59:58.678 --> 01:00:01.430
- You're blushing.
- Dexter.

01:00:04.517 --> 01:00:05.559
Is that...?

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:07.936
- That's my parents.
- Who's that?

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:10.772
I wonder what he's doing.
He's not supposed to be in town.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.025
Oh, my God. I should go.

01:00:13.192 --> 01:00:14.610
No, don't.

01:00:14.819 --> 01:00:16.236
- Dex.
- Stay.

01:00:16.404 --> 01:00:18.530
Well, this is a surprise. Heh, heh.

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:21.867
Dex, what are you doing here?
We thought you were in the Hamptons.

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:23.910
- I had to work.
- Mm. Had to work.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.872
Mom, Dad, you remember Rachel White.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.874
Oh, my gosh, yes.

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:31.376
- Hello, dear.
- Hi. Good to see you.

01:00:31.544 --> 01:00:35.130
Guess who was asleep in the box
with his head on the pillow next to Buddy.

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:39.635
Little Dex did not come out of that box
for two days. Ha-ha-ha.

01:00:40.553 --> 01:00:42.220
Dexter, come. Let's walk.

01:00:42.388 --> 01:00:44.640
- Excuse us, ladies.
- Excuse us.

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:47.726
Mom, thank you for thoroughly
embarrassing me. Appreciate that.

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:48.977
My pleasure.

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:55.359
Your mother doesn't like me drinking
during the daytime.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:59.529
Well, she looks good. She seems happy.

01:00:59.697 --> 01:01:01.657
She sure does.

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:04.242
I don't think I've ever seen her so happy.

01:01:05.536 --> 01:01:07.245
Must be the wedding.

01:01:08.706 --> 01:01:10.123
Cheers.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:13.085
Dad, can I ask you a question?

01:01:16.964 --> 01:01:20.425
Have you ever gone down a road...

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:24.179
...I mean, far down it and...

01:01:25.598 --> 01:01:29.935
And wondered maybe
if it wasn't what you want?

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:32.104
What you want.

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:34.898
The problem with that expression is...

01:01:35.066 --> 01:01:38.068
...it's frequently at odds
with what's right.

01:01:39.153 --> 01:01:40.821
Isn't it?

01:01:42.657 --> 01:01:46.618
Now, whatever's going on between you
and that girl, you stop it. Now.

01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:48.245
- But, Dad...
- No.

01:01:48.413 --> 01:01:50.122
You know what I'm talking about.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.584
That's not the kind of people we are.

01:01:57.171 --> 01:01:58.547
Yes, sir.

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:08.640
Your mom is a sweetheart.

01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:11.476
Your dad...

01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:14.896
I see where the strong silent thing
comes from.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:18.275
Is everything okay?

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:21.945
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just tired.

01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:27.617
Do you wanna come up?

01:02:29.495 --> 01:02:33.498
I do, but, uh, Darcy texted
and they're on their way back, so...

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:37.169
- Oh. Yeah.
- I should...

01:02:39.505 --> 01:02:41.798
Rachel, just so you know...

01:02:42.675 --> 01:02:44.342
...what I said this morning...

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.094
Yeah?

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:50.515
I meant it.

01:03:03.696 --> 01:03:05.447
That's what he said?

01:03:05.698 --> 01:03:08.074
It's complicated, Ethan.

01:03:11.704 --> 01:03:13.038
Don't.

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:17.626
Don't what? Rachel, it's not complicated.
He's being a dick.

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.628
To be honest, you're being stupid.

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:21.797
- Whoa. I'm being stupid?
- Yes.

01:03:22.256 --> 01:03:25.592
He's stringing you along. And the
worst part is you're just letting him.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.345
How long are you gonna let this happen?
His wedding day?

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:31.264
- His first anniversary?
- He's not even married yet, Ethan.

01:03:31.432 --> 01:03:34.601
Exactly, Rachel.
He's not even married yet.

01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:37.562
Which means he can change his situation
anytime he wants.

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.732
But he hasn't, has he?

01:03:41.442 --> 01:03:45.695
Have you even seen him, have you even
talked to him since the Fourth of July?

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:51.910
Rachel, when did you become one
of these women that just waits?

01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:54.287
And is still waiting.

01:03:54.455 --> 01:03:57.249
I don't exactly see you
living your happily ever after.

01:03:57.750 --> 01:04:01.503
Maybe you're right. But at least I try.
At least I take chances.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:04.172
When? When is the last time
you took a chance?

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:07.259
Two days ago, when I decided
to move to London.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:10.762
- What?
- Yeah. I'm moving there in the fall.

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:12.931
When were you gonna tell me?

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:17.185
Um, today. Just now, actually,
before you yelled at me.

01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:23.942
There's a publisher
who's really interested in my book.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:25.235
She wants to work on it.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.028
Ethan, that's incredible.

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:31.283
Hey, you wanna give me
a killer going-away present?

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:34.786
- What?
- Tell your boyfriend to make a decision.

01:04:41.168 --> 01:04:42.460
Nice, Justin.

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:50.802
I'm okay.

01:04:54.807 --> 01:04:57.183
Oh, nice one!

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:00.562
Hey.

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:01.813
Hi.

01:05:02.523 --> 01:05:04.149
So I'm lying in bed last night...

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:09.821
...thinking about you,
wondering if I should jerk off or not.

01:05:10.823 --> 01:05:13.325
But the thing was, I couldn't get it up.

01:05:13.492 --> 01:05:17.203
And that never happens, by the way.
Just FYI. Never happens to me.

01:05:17.371 --> 01:05:20.332
And it wasn't because
I don't think you're hot. I do.

01:05:20.499 --> 01:05:22.709
I totally think you're hot.

01:05:22.877 --> 01:05:23.919
I just feel...

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:27.505
I don't know.
I associate you now with failure.

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:33.345
How do you make the most hideous things
sound charming?

01:05:33.512 --> 01:05:36.264
- That's a compliment, right?
- Sure. Ha-ha-ha.

01:05:37.558 --> 01:05:39.184
So how big you think it is?

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:40.602
Excuse me?

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:42.187
Oh, my God.

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:44.272
The house. You think it'll be big?

01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:46.191
What house?

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:48.985
The house that Dex's old man
is buying for him and Darcy.

01:05:50.488 --> 01:05:52.322
What, Darcy didn't tell you?

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:54.699
Yeah, yeah.
My dad is Dex's dad's realtor.

01:05:54.867 --> 01:05:57.118
They're... Right now,
they're out in Westchester...

01:05:57.286 --> 01:06:00.372
...looking for $2 million mansions.

01:06:00.539 --> 01:06:02.582
Must be nice, huh?

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:09.047
- Gorgeous.
- Oak floors throughout.

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:11.132
This is the study.

01:06:11.592 --> 01:06:13.468
You look good in here, babe.

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:17.681
Hand-cut
Vermont fieldstone. Watch your step.

01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:20.183
Natural light to the left.

01:06:20.434 --> 01:06:22.811
Southern exposure to the right.

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:27.816
So how many kids
you planning to have?

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.610
As many as Dex's father tells me to have.

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:32.320
- This is amazing.
- Isn't it great?

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:35.907
- We love you so much.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:40.537
Hmm. So Dex?

01:06:41.038 --> 01:06:42.706
What do you think?

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.501
It's great.

01:06:53.884 --> 01:06:56.553
- Hello.
- Hey, you little tart.

01:06:56.721 --> 01:06:58.430
Marcus just texted me.

01:06:58.597 --> 01:07:04.602
He said you guys saw each other today.
So spill the beans. Circumcised?

01:07:05.646 --> 01:07:08.106
When were you gonna tell me
about looking at houses?

01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:13.445
How did you know? Oh, Marcus's dad.

01:07:13.612 --> 01:07:15.697
Um, it wasn't, like, a little secret.

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:18.450
Wait till you see this house
that we loved.

01:07:18.617 --> 01:07:20.201
Oh, my God. We loved it.

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:22.037
We haven't decided anything yet.

01:07:22.621 --> 01:07:24.873
- Oh, am I on speaker?
- Hi, Rach.

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:26.124
Hey, Dex.

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:27.959
You like the house too?

01:07:28.961 --> 01:07:32.172
Uh, yeah, it was... It was okay.

01:07:32.339 --> 01:07:33.923
What are you talking about?

01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:37.302
- We loved it.
- That's great. I gotta go. But, Darce?

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:40.597
- Yeah.
- Yes, Marcus is circumcised.

01:07:44.643 --> 01:07:47.812
Opposing counsel gave me
a two-week extension to respond.

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:48.980
Yes, I'll hold.

01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:14.756
We only have one night.

01:08:15.508 --> 01:08:17.675
Oh, I know. Me too.

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:20.970
- Bye, Rachel.
- Night. Bye.

01:08:21.138 --> 01:08:23.430
- Good night. Good night, Darcy.
- Air, air.

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:25.809
Darce, where...? Where are you going?

01:08:25.975 --> 01:08:28.853
You know what?
I'm gonna sleep over at Rachel's tonight.

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:31.773
Oh, come on. We haven't had
a sleepover in, like, forever.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:35.693
And, plus, Dex is gonna be out
with all his bachelor buddies all night.

01:08:35.861 --> 01:08:37.153
Oh.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:39.531
Okay, bye.

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:41.616
Love you.

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:44.993
So, what's going on in Marcus-land?

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:46.371
You gonna marry him?

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:47.705
Stop it.

01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:51.000
What? Marcus isn't marriage material?

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:57.215
Who is calling at this ungodly hour?

01:08:58.716 --> 01:09:00.051
- Who is it?
- Hello?

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:03.555
Rachel, it's me.
Please, don't hang up.

01:09:03.721 --> 01:09:05.140
- Rachel.
- Who is it?

01:09:06.058 --> 01:09:09.352
I miss you. That's all I want to say.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.854
Um...

01:09:11.897 --> 01:09:16.693
Look, can I come up? I just wanna talk.

01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:18.403
Who is it?

01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:20.488
- Ethan.
- Ethan?

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:22.823
Ethan? No, it's Dex.

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:24.408
I'm downstairs.

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:26.493
- Can I see you?
- Wait, you're downstairs?

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.453
No! No, no, no! Darcy's here, so...

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:32.082
He's downstairs and he wants to come up
at 3 in the morning?

01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:33.376
Um, I'm gonna...

01:09:34.086 --> 01:09:36.129
Oh, my God.

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:39.591
- Ew.
- What?

01:09:39.758 --> 01:09:42.051
Ew! Ew!

01:09:43.636 --> 01:09:48.558
Oh, my God. You are having a fling
with Ethan?

01:09:50.102 --> 01:09:52.270
Oh, my God, you're having an affair
with Ethan.

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:54.522
- I gotta go.
- He's downstairs.

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:56.816
- No, he's... Oh, shit.
- Ainsley?

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:04.407
Oh, Ainsley! Way to go, honey!
I didn't know you had it in you, you little shithead!

01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:07.076
- Close the window.
- You little tart.

01:10:07.244 --> 01:10:09.954
Oh, my God. Why didn't you tell me?

01:10:10.122 --> 01:10:12.415
Um, you know, it just happened.

01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:14.959
It just happened.

01:10:15.127 --> 01:10:19.214
Well, we're gonna celebrate
your just happening right now.

01:10:20.591 --> 01:10:22.592
What are you doing? Oh, come on.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.303
- It's your favorite thing in the world.
- Darcy, no. No.

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:27.722
- Not tonight.
- Sixth grade, second place.

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:28.932
Not now.

01:10:29.099 --> 01:10:31.142
We should've won.
Get over here right now.

01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:32.477
I suck.

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:34.145
Five, six, seven, eight!

01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:36.481
Ooh, baby, baby

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:37.941
Baby, baby

01:10:38.108 --> 01:10:39.150
Ooh, baby

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:45.448
Salt-N-Pepa's here, and we're in effect
Want you to push it back

01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:49.619
Coolin' by day, then at night
Workin' up a sweat

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:53.581
Come on, girls, let's go show the guys
That we know how to become

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:58.169
Number one in a hot party show
Now, push it

01:11:00.005 --> 01:11:01.839
Push it good

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.634
Push it real good

01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:09.389
Push it good

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:12.517
Push it real good

01:11:27.032 --> 01:11:31.911
People who were friends as kids
almost always lose touch eventually.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.039
I'm glad we didn't.

01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:38.626
Me too.

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:41.879
And we never will, right?

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:45.216
No.

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:49.470
I don't think there's anybody
who knows me like you.

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:51.556
Not even Dex does.

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:54.225
Not like you do.

01:11:55.227 --> 01:12:00.064
It's like you totally accept me.

01:12:01.066 --> 01:12:02.859
Darce, why are you saying all this?

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.239
I don't know.

01:12:11.243 --> 01:12:15.872
But when you're getting married, you start
thinking about all your big moments.

01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:20.168
And you're in all of mine.

01:12:22.129 --> 01:12:24.088
Me too.

01:12:37.144 --> 01:12:39.020
Darcy?

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:47.987
I have to tell you something.

01:12:55.287 --> 01:12:57.330
Something I've done.

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:00.458
Rachel...

01:13:01.585 --> 01:13:03.336
...I love you.

01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:08.299
And I would never let
anyone hurt you, ever.

01:13:09.676 --> 01:13:12.220
And you wouldn't let
anyone hurt me, right?

01:13:14.139 --> 01:13:16.099
No.

01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:43.668
Rach.

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:47.964
- Hmm.
- Rach. Oh, God.

01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:49.799
Good morning.

01:13:50.217 --> 01:13:52.009
Do you think I should marry Dex?

01:13:54.221 --> 01:13:55.471
What?

01:13:55.639 --> 01:13:58.850
No, I mean it.
Do you think this is a good idea?

01:13:59.017 --> 01:14:02.186
I mean, nobody knows me like you.
And you sort of know Dex too.

01:14:02.354 --> 01:14:05.857
And you're much smarter than I am.
I mean, book-smarter, anyway.

01:14:06.525 --> 01:14:08.526
But what I'm trying to say is...

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:11.529
...you're not gonna let me
do anything dumb, are you?

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:13.114
Darcy.

01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:15.700
No, I mean it, because...

01:14:16.368 --> 01:14:20.746
Ugh, I can really do...
I can really do dumb shit.

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:22.874
Because I do love him. I do.

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.878
And I know what he sees in me.

01:14:27.045 --> 01:14:28.463
What?

01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:31.299
You know what I mean.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.926
He's never met anybody like me...

01:14:34.094 --> 01:14:37.472
...because I don't let stuff get to me.

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:40.725
Which is true, because I always
assume everything'll just work out.

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:43.436
And I guess it's because it always has.

01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:46.230
So I make him lighter, and he kind of...

01:14:48.066 --> 01:14:51.986
He makes me heavier, somehow.
In a good way.

01:14:52.446 --> 01:14:54.113
Does that make sense?

01:14:54.448 --> 01:14:56.073
It does.

01:14:58.118 --> 01:15:01.120
And what you said in your vows...

01:15:01.288 --> 01:15:02.580
...I feel that.

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:05.333
Especially when you said...

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:07.251
Um...

01:15:07.711 --> 01:15:09.170
What exactly did you say again?

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:14.050
- Life without him would be unimaginable.
- Yes. And it would.

01:15:14.468 --> 01:15:17.094
But is that enough for a marriage?

01:15:20.432 --> 01:15:22.183
I think...

01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:25.937
Yeah?

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:31.901
You should marry him.

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:37.073
I love you so much.

01:15:38.283 --> 01:15:39.784
I love you, Darcy.

01:15:41.411 --> 01:15:45.414
You are the best girlfriend in the world.
Ever.

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:51.963
So it's okay that I kind of cheated on him
a little bit?

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:54.924
What?

01:15:55.676 --> 01:15:58.135
I... Just barely. Heh. Once.

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:02.056
- With whom?
- Well, he was a guy from work.

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:05.851
And it was nothing.
You know me, it was just sex.

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:10.481
And I felt terrible, so that's good.

01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:12.149
Right?

01:16:12.317 --> 01:16:16.487
Plus, Dex hasn't had sex with me
since before the Fourth of July.

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:20.324
Ugh. I'm so happy I got this off my chest.

01:16:20.659 --> 01:16:23.077
I hate feeling guilty. I hate it.

01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:26.080
I feel so much better now.

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:29.166
Oh, my God.
So when are you gonna tell him?

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:32.128
Do you want me to tell him?
I would love to tell him.

01:16:32.296 --> 01:16:35.965
It's none of your business.
I told Darcy to marry him. I'm bowing out.

01:16:36.133 --> 01:16:39.552
She just told you she's cheating.
You want your opportunity, take it.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:41.804
Ethan, stop.

01:16:41.972 --> 01:16:45.600
I don't really get it.
I don't get how you let her win all the time.

01:16:46.226 --> 01:16:47.268
Wow.

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:51.397
Oh. No, "wow" nothing. If the tables
were turned, you think she'd let you win?

01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:54.984
Will you stop? What is it with you two?
Why do you hate her so much?

01:16:55.152 --> 01:16:56.527
What? I don't hate her.

01:16:56.695 --> 01:17:00.197
I hate the fact that you yield to her
at every turn.

01:17:00.365 --> 01:17:02.825
So why do you do it?
Why do you let her win?

01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:06.621
Because that's what Darcy does.
Darcy wins. She always has.

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:10.166
She sees things, she wants them,
she gets them.

01:17:10.542 --> 01:17:12.209
Ethan, she got into Notre Dame.

01:17:12.377 --> 01:17:16.047
Do you know how hard it is to get
into Notre Dame? It is impossible.

01:17:16.214 --> 01:17:19.175
But she did. And with her grades?

01:17:20.552 --> 01:17:22.219
You're kidding, right?

01:17:22.387 --> 01:17:24.847
You're not kidding?
Did you see her acceptance letter?

01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:28.768
- What are you talking about?
- Did you see the acceptance letter? I didn't.

01:17:28.935 --> 01:17:31.228
Remember when she asked
Michael Jordan to prom?

01:17:31.396 --> 01:17:33.356
They sent a letter
saying he couldn't make it.

01:17:33.523 --> 01:17:35.483
How many times did she show us
that letter?

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.985
I could recite it right now.
That was a rejection.

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:40.237
Do you really think
if she were accepted...

01:17:40.405 --> 01:17:43.115
...that she wouldn't make us
memorize that letter too?

01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:45.409
Rachel, come on.

01:17:45.869 --> 01:17:48.204
She never got into Notre Dame.

01:17:52.417 --> 01:17:56.462
Rachel. Okay, look, I get it. You're in
a tough spot because you love him.

01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:58.381
But you gotta do something about it.

01:17:58.548 --> 01:18:01.425
He's a coward. If he breaks your heart,
I'm gonna take a swing at him.

01:18:01.593 --> 01:18:04.261
- Then I'm gonna let him beat me up.
- I gotta go. I'm late.

01:18:04.429 --> 01:18:08.099
I know! Rachel, that's the point.
Be late. Better yet, quit.

01:18:08.266 --> 01:18:10.601
At least it would be a decision.
Rachel!

01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:14.855
You're all going to hell anyway, so you
might as well do something for yourself.

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:17.942
For once.
Rachel, you deserve to be happy.

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:20.403
Then butt out.
That would make me happy.

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:23.531
I'll figure it out on my own.

01:18:23.782 --> 01:18:29.578
Oh. Oh, that's great.
Let me know how that goes.

01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:37.753
Serve is up.

01:18:37.921 --> 01:18:39.463
All right.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.051
- Whoo!
- Go! Yes!

01:18:44.469 --> 01:18:46.637
Five-zip. We're killing you, Rachel.

01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:48.055
Isn't that the truth?

01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:50.558
It is, right?

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:53.060
I'm really competitive,
so I need you to focus.

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:56.397
You gotta pop it, Rach. Pop it.

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:58.858
- It's a backhand.
- Serve's up. Here we go.

01:18:59.025 --> 01:19:00.818
Go, Dex, do it.

01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:03.237
- Aah! Oops.
- Yeah!

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:05.156
Who doesn't love badminton?

01:19:05.323 --> 01:19:08.451
Have you ever even played
a sport in your life?

01:19:08.618 --> 01:19:10.244
I think she's calling you gay, son.

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:11.829
- I heard it.
- Hey, Romeo.

01:19:11.997 --> 01:19:15.332
Why don't you get up off your ass
and come help out your Juliet?

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.168
- What?
- Darcy.

01:19:17.335 --> 01:19:18.794
Your secret lover. Wink, wink.

01:19:18.962 --> 01:19:22.089
- Darcy.
- Rachel shared your secret. Oops.

01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:25.843
Oh. Oh, wow. We're sharing secrets now.

01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:29.138
See, I didn't know we were at that part
of the day, but I am in.

01:19:29.306 --> 01:19:30.639
- Ethan.
- This sounds like fun.

01:19:30.807 --> 01:19:33.476
- Give me this. Let's do this.
- The novelist wants to play.

01:19:33.643 --> 01:19:35.978
I got an idea.
How about it's us versus you guys...

01:19:36.146 --> 01:19:38.355
...but we'll do a secret for every point?

01:19:38.523 --> 01:19:41.275
- Love that.
- Ethan. Stop.

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:43.027
Gotta do this. Here we go.

01:19:43.195 --> 01:19:45.237
- Don't.
- I love it so much, I'll serve first.

01:19:45.405 --> 01:19:47.281
All right? Hit me, Dex.

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:51.035
Dex, hit me.

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:53.204
His name rhymes with sex.
You know that?

01:19:53.371 --> 01:19:54.580
I knew that.

01:19:54.748 --> 01:19:55.873
I'm so happy to be here.

01:19:56.041 --> 01:19:57.541
Ready?

01:20:01.546 --> 01:20:03.047
Yes, do it again.

01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:08.803
Whoo! Yeah! Yippee! We got a point. I got
a secret. Rachel and Ethan are having sex.

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.805
- Ugh.
- What?

01:20:10.972 --> 01:20:12.556
I was there the other night...

01:20:12.724 --> 01:20:15.726
...and somebody showed up
for a little booty call.

01:20:15.894 --> 01:20:18.729
I knew it. I called it, I knew it.

01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:21.398
What? You told me you were gay!

01:20:21.566 --> 01:20:23.692
That makes more sense.

01:20:25.445 --> 01:20:27.988
I think that things
are getting a tad competitive.

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:30.866
- Why don't we just take it down a notch?
- No. Honey, serve.

01:20:31.034 --> 01:20:32.660
Rachel's right. Why don't we...?

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:34.662
No, no, no. Let's do this.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:35.996
- Serve it.
- Do it.

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:37.540
- Just...
- You know what?

01:20:37.707 --> 01:20:39.166
Let's keep telling secrets.

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:40.543
- Come on.
- Serve it!

01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:43.379
Yeah. Serve it, Dex.

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:45.756
Serve it, Dex.

01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:48.008
Serve it, Dex.

01:20:48.552 --> 01:20:50.052
Serve it.

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:55.266
Yep. Easy.

01:20:56.768 --> 01:20:58.102
Watch out.

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.062
- Excuse me.
- Aah!

01:21:01.731 --> 01:21:03.357
- Rachel!
- Jesus!

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:07.111
Come on, Dex!

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:10.239
Okay. Yeah, really?

01:21:10.407 --> 01:21:11.740
I got it.

01:21:14.786 --> 01:21:18.289
- There you go. Yeah. All right.
- Ethan, stop.

01:21:18.456 --> 01:21:20.291
No. Let's hear a secret.

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:21.959
Rach, why don't you do this one?

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:23.961
Come on, guys.
I think we're done here.

01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:26.881
- No, Dex. We're not.
- Ethan, stop it!

01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:29.925
- What is going on?
- If she's not gonna tell you, I will.

01:21:30.093 --> 01:21:31.093
Okay, here we go.

01:21:44.774 --> 01:21:46.525
Shit.

01:21:46.943 --> 01:21:48.485
What the hell was that?

01:21:48.653 --> 01:21:50.613
Me? You broke my nose.

01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:52.489
I'm sure I didn't break your nose.

01:21:52.657 --> 01:21:56.160
God. And what is all this
about us having sex?

01:21:56.328 --> 01:21:59.163
Jesus, Rachel, just leave me out
of your goddamn soap opera.

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:00.956
No one asked you to get involved.

01:22:01.124 --> 01:22:04.668
Really? So why have I been listening
to this bullshit all summer?

01:22:05.337 --> 01:22:09.006
Rachel, do something, because this
is just pathetic. But you know what?

01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:11.342
At the end of the day,
you deserve each other.

01:22:11.509 --> 01:22:13.135
He's never gonna do anything.

01:22:13.303 --> 01:22:15.721
You're never gonna ask him to,
and let's be honest...

01:22:15.889 --> 01:22:20.100
...you and I both know that, even if you
did, she will never let you have him.

01:22:21.519 --> 01:22:24.521
- You're an asshole!
- Yeah, maybe I am!

01:22:24.689 --> 01:22:28.359
But I'm the only asshole here
who gives a shit about you!

01:22:36.534 --> 01:22:38.827
I wanna know
what it is you're not telling me.

01:22:38.995 --> 01:22:41.497
- There's nothing to tell.
- If you wanna know something...

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:44.792
I'm sorry, that's weird
and bizarre. And I'm asking you.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:47.127
I don't wanna talk outside.

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:50.673
He's not really gay, is he?

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:54.551
No.

01:22:55.929 --> 01:22:59.390
Uh, Claire, we're not
having an affair, either.

01:22:59.557 --> 01:23:01.558
That was just a...

01:23:01.726 --> 01:23:03.394
It was...

01:23:05.563 --> 01:23:09.400
He's never gonna love me, is he?

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.656
I don't think so.

01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:21.912
Least I tried. Right?

01:23:25.625 --> 01:23:26.667
Yeah.

01:23:30.505 --> 01:23:32.589
Ethan's...
Like I said, I think it's weird too.

01:23:32.757 --> 01:23:34.425
Whatever.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:48.939
- You told Ethan?
- No. He guessed.

01:23:49.107 --> 01:23:52.776
Darcy's upset. She keeps asking me
what happened on the beach today.

01:23:52.944 --> 01:23:54.611
You know what?

01:23:55.613 --> 01:23:57.114
Work it out with her, Dex.

01:23:58.241 --> 01:23:59.408
Well...

01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:04.663
Rachel.

01:24:04.831 --> 01:24:06.457
Rachel, what am I supposed to do?

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:10.919
Forget what you're supposed to do, Dex.
Do what you wanna do.

01:24:11.087 --> 01:24:14.131
Live your own life
the way you want to live it.

01:24:14.299 --> 01:24:17.468
You wanna teach? Teach.

01:24:17.635 --> 01:24:20.512
You don't wanna be the man
who lives in the big house you hate?

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:22.431
Then don't be him.

01:24:22.599 --> 01:24:26.643
Or do. Just decide.

01:24:59.677 --> 01:25:00.844
- That was awesome.
- What?

01:25:01.012 --> 01:25:02.846
Nothing. You've got a great laugh.

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:07.434
Wait. When did this happen
that you were like, "I wanna be a lawyer"?

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:11.105
Who says, "You know what I wanna
do when I grow up? I wanna be a lawyer."

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:12.815
I'm sorry. I'm gonna take off.

01:25:12.982 --> 01:25:15.442
Where are you going?
Come on, sit down.

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:17.861
I'm beat. This week has done me in.

01:25:18.029 --> 01:25:19.196
I'll take you home.

01:25:19.364 --> 01:25:21.865
- No, you don't have to.
- No, it's fine. I'd like to.

01:25:22.033 --> 01:25:25.202
Stop it. You two stay. I'm exhausted.

01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:28.205
- Darcy, I will call you in the morning.
- Okay.

01:25:28.373 --> 01:25:32.209
Dex, you were incredible this week.
I owe you one.

01:25:50.395 --> 01:25:51.937
Rachel.

01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:55.149
Rach.

01:25:55.525 --> 01:25:58.735
Hey. What's up?

01:26:00.071 --> 01:26:03.073
I just... I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

01:26:03.241 --> 01:26:05.284
Okay with...?

01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:09.496
Well, with this.

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:12.666
Oh, yeah. Totally.

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:14.501
No, Darcy's fantastic.

01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:19.506
And, hey, you never know where
it might lead, right?

01:26:19.924 --> 01:26:21.592
Yeah.

01:26:21.926 --> 01:26:23.594
Okay.

01:26:24.971 --> 01:26:26.763
Well, good night.

01:26:27.932 --> 01:26:29.474
Good night.

01:26:44.699 --> 01:26:46.450
Dex!

01:26:48.953 --> 01:26:50.621
Dex!

01:26:52.373 --> 01:26:54.917
- Dex!
- What's wrong?

01:26:55.084 --> 01:26:56.627
I shouldn't have left.

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:59.713
- No, it's okay. I understand.
- No. Six years ago.

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:03.967
That night. I shouldn't have left.

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:07.262
It wasn't okay what happened.

01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:09.389
- None of it was okay.
- Rachel...

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:11.683
No, no, no, let me say it.

01:27:13.144 --> 01:27:15.312
Cancel the wedding.

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:18.148
Tell her you can't marry her.

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:24.988
I love you. I've always loved you.

01:27:25.657 --> 01:27:29.326
And I should've told you a long time ago,
but I'm telling you now...

01:27:29.494 --> 01:27:32.663
...before it's too late,
before it's really too late.

01:27:33.331 --> 01:27:36.250
You're not the only one
who hasn't been living his life.

01:27:37.001 --> 01:27:42.339
I haven't either, but I wanna live it now.
And I wanna live it with you.

01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:55.644
I can't, Rachel.

01:27:57.772 --> 01:28:00.107
I'm so sorry.

01:28:05.071 --> 01:28:06.780
I can't.

01:29:15.224 --> 01:29:18.226
Hey, it's Ethan.
Leave a message. Cheers.

01:29:43.628 --> 01:29:45.796
I'm sorry.

01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:57.224
Wow, thank God you said sorry first,
because that would've been embarrassing.

01:29:57.392 --> 01:30:00.060
- Heh-heh-heh. Hi.
- Hi.

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:05.649
- Wow. Are you trying to make me cry?
- Heh, heh.

01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:12.489
Hey, so totally not a big deal,
but, um, why are you here?

01:30:12.657 --> 01:30:14.950
I, uh, just needed to get away.

01:30:15.118 --> 01:30:19.329
This close to the wedding?
Darcy must be freaking out.

01:30:19.497 --> 01:30:21.415
You're where?

01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:24.668
It is one week before my wedding,
Rachel, and you're in London?

01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:26.002
I know.

01:30:26.170 --> 01:30:28.004
Um, I, uh...

01:30:30.133 --> 01:30:31.633
I just need some time.

01:30:32.969 --> 01:30:34.302
You're my maid of honor.

01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:36.138
- And you needed time?
- It's Rachel?

01:30:36.305 --> 01:30:38.181
- Are you kidding?
- I, um...

01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:43.687
Rachel, Rachel, the band you picked sucks.
The caterer is a nightmare.

01:30:43.855 --> 01:30:46.481
You need to get back here right now.
Right now.

01:30:47.024 --> 01:30:49.526
- Darcy...
- Right now!

01:30:51.737 --> 01:30:53.238
No.

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:55.323
Wow.

01:30:56.033 --> 01:30:57.200
What the fuck?

01:30:57.368 --> 01:30:59.536
Do you need me
to be your maid of honor?

01:31:01.372 --> 01:31:02.539
Oh, my God.

01:31:02.748 --> 01:31:04.207
I can do it.

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:14.509
I have dreamed about Darcy getting married
almost my whole life.

01:31:14.677 --> 01:31:18.388
But I don't know how to stand next to them
while they promise those things.

01:31:19.056 --> 01:31:21.099
While she says my words.

01:31:21.267 --> 01:31:23.685
I still say you should've
told Dex she was cheating.

01:31:23.853 --> 01:31:29.107
No. And, besides,
I didn't want him to pick me by default.

01:31:29.775 --> 01:31:31.902
I wanna be someone's first choice.

01:31:32.403 --> 01:31:33.904
Yeah.

01:31:35.072 --> 01:31:36.531
You are.

01:31:36.699 --> 01:31:38.909
No, I know what you're saying.

01:31:40.411 --> 01:31:42.078
I'm not his first choice.

01:31:42.246 --> 01:31:44.039
Maybe you're someone's first choice.

01:31:59.055 --> 01:32:00.680
What?

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:02.933
You never wondered about me?

01:32:04.769 --> 01:32:07.062
I don't know how to say this. Um...

01:32:08.606 --> 01:32:11.233
God, Rachel, I like you.

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:15.111
I've always liked you.

01:32:15.863 --> 01:32:20.116
And when another guy came in the picture,
I liked you even more.

01:32:22.245 --> 01:32:27.040
You are home for me.

01:32:30.253 --> 01:32:32.712
Wow. That sounded crazy. Heh.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:37.634
Wow. And that's probably what all this is.
I mean, it's probably just crazy. It's not...

01:32:37.843 --> 01:32:39.636
It's not love.

01:32:40.304 --> 01:32:43.181
Even though it kind of feels like it is.

01:32:46.644 --> 01:32:48.436
Don't worry, I...

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:51.856
My love's not really
the overwhelming kind.

01:32:52.024 --> 01:32:58.154
Jesus, when I'm in love, I, uh, drink rosÃ©
and watch Remains of the Day. So...

01:33:04.287 --> 01:33:07.038
I don't know, Rachel.
Maybe it's just that I...

01:33:07.957 --> 01:33:09.833
Maybe it's just that I miss you.

01:33:15.131 --> 01:33:18.049
But I think you fell in love
with someone else.

01:33:23.514 --> 01:33:28.059
And I think you still are.

01:33:42.658 --> 01:33:44.993
Oh, damn it.

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:49.205
- I knew I should've gone for Claire.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:33:55.046 --> 01:33:57.464
- You still have a pump in every color.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:33:58.633 --> 01:34:02.552
Yeah, every night,
I put on my princess outfit.

01:34:19.987 --> 01:34:21.196
Oh, good, you're up.

01:34:24.367 --> 01:34:25.742
Hey, Ethan?

01:34:26.202 --> 01:34:27.744
I'm going back.

01:34:27.912 --> 01:34:32.082
Yeah, well, I think you and I both knew
you weren't gonna miss that wedding.

01:34:32.249 --> 01:34:34.918
No, I'm not going back for her.

01:34:38.172 --> 01:34:40.423
This isn't who I am.

01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:44.260
I can't do whatever I want
and not care if I hurt anybody.

01:34:44.428 --> 01:34:47.597
Besides, Darcy didn't do anything wrong.
I did.

01:34:47.765 --> 01:34:51.434
Rachel, I can't hear this "Daddy hits
me because he loves me" stuff anymore.

01:34:51.602 --> 01:34:54.896
No, this isn't me
being pathetic anymore.

01:34:55.564 --> 01:34:59.275
I have always thought it was Darcy
who took things from me...

01:34:59.485 --> 01:35:03.613
...but really it was just me
who was giving everything up to her.

01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:06.741
And Darcy may be...

01:35:08.077 --> 01:35:13.248
...whatever Darcy is. I don't know what
Darcy is, but she is my best friend.

01:35:13.791 --> 01:35:16.376
And I want to be there for her.

01:35:16.544 --> 01:35:18.795
So I'm going to that wedding.

01:35:26.929 --> 01:35:28.471
Then you win.

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:00.503
How did you, uh...?

01:36:00.671 --> 01:36:04.674
Called your office.
I wanted to be here when you got home.

01:36:06.635 --> 01:36:08.344
You have to go.

01:36:09.346 --> 01:36:11.181
I can't do this anymore.

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:17.771
She deserves better. So do you. So do I.

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:23.860
I called off the wedding.

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:35.455
I told her I couldn't marry her.

01:36:38.375 --> 01:36:39.876
When?

01:36:40.586 --> 01:36:42.879
Couple hours ago.

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:53.348
What did she say?

01:36:53.974 --> 01:36:55.016
What did she do?

01:36:55.184 --> 01:36:57.393
She's pretty upset.

01:36:57.645 --> 01:37:00.730
Mostly about what people
are gonna think.

01:37:01.398 --> 01:37:03.399
Then she threw a few things.

01:37:03.818 --> 01:37:05.568
Did you tell her about us?

01:37:06.695 --> 01:37:10.532
She asked if there was someone else.
I said no.

01:37:12.785 --> 01:37:15.537
Because I'm not sure yet if there still is.

01:37:17.373 --> 01:37:19.332
I don't know what to say.

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:24.838
I don't expect anything.
I don't deserve to expect anything.

01:37:25.548 --> 01:37:29.092
I was afraid of hurting people.

01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:31.678
And I just want to thank you...

01:37:32.137 --> 01:37:35.098
...for finally asking
for what you wanted...

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:39.686
...and for helping me to do the same.

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:44.732
I want to apologize...

01:37:47.403 --> 01:37:50.780
...for being such a moron
outside that bar six years ago...

01:37:53.158 --> 01:37:55.994
...and outside the Jetty last week...

01:37:58.622 --> 01:38:02.959
...where I made the worst decision
of my life.

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:10.133
Basically, you and I shouldn't have
conversations outside bars anymore.

01:38:21.353 --> 01:38:23.146
Rachel. Open up.

01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:28.651
- Darcy.
- Yes. Open the door.

01:38:28.819 --> 01:38:30.612
How did you get into the building?

01:38:30.779 --> 01:38:33.990
There was a pizza guy and he
let me in. Who cares? Open the door.

01:38:34.158 --> 01:38:36.159
I need to talk to you!

01:38:37.202 --> 01:38:38.244
Yeah, um...

01:38:39.371 --> 01:38:40.830
- I'm just changing.
- Ugh!

01:38:41.332 --> 01:38:45.251
I've seen your ass. Open the door.

01:38:47.338 --> 01:38:48.838
I called off the wedding.

01:38:51.675 --> 01:38:53.009
- You did.
- Well...

01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:57.430
...technically, Dex said it first,
but I was thinking the same thing.

01:38:57.765 --> 01:39:01.935
Wow. I think I need some air
to process that. Wanna go for a walk?

01:39:02.102 --> 01:39:04.812
No. I need to sit down.

01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:07.815
- Before I tell you what I came to tell you...
- Okay.

01:39:07.983 --> 01:39:10.860
...I just wanna say that I'm not
the only one of us...

01:39:11.028 --> 01:39:12.862
...who's being dishonest here.

01:39:17.326 --> 01:39:20.203
- What have I been dishonest about?
- Please.

01:39:20.996 --> 01:39:22.830
Give me a little credit, Rachel.

01:39:25.042 --> 01:39:27.126
Claire told me you were lying
about Ethan.

01:39:27.294 --> 01:39:30.505
I know for an absolute fact
that you are not sleeping with Marcus.

01:39:30.673 --> 01:39:34.050
So, what, you're making up stories
to make me jealous?

01:39:34.218 --> 01:39:37.720
You know I'm more sexual than you.
I always have been.

01:39:37.888 --> 01:39:41.015
I wasn't e... And there was never a...

01:39:42.685 --> 01:39:44.894
How did you know
I never slept with Marcus?

01:39:45.729 --> 01:39:49.148
Well, um, you said he was circumcised.

01:39:50.317 --> 01:39:53.361
- Okay.
- And he is not.

01:39:55.906 --> 01:39:57.699
Marcus is the guy you slept with?

01:39:58.117 --> 01:40:00.618
That's what I wanted to tell you.

01:40:00.786 --> 01:40:03.538
- Can you get me some water?
- Wait, when?

01:40:03.956 --> 01:40:05.790
When did you sleep with him?

01:40:05.958 --> 01:40:07.750
Fourth of July.

01:40:07.918 --> 01:40:10.753
Well, we were both lonely,
and we were both drunk.

01:40:12.131 --> 01:40:14.924
And we both felt awful afterwards.

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:20.680
I mean, we promised right then and there
that we would never do it again.

01:40:22.391 --> 01:40:25.601
And we broke that promise,
because we did it again.

01:40:25.769 --> 01:40:26.769
A couple times.

01:40:26.937 --> 01:40:28.896
You slept with him more than once?

01:40:31.108 --> 01:40:35.278
Oh, God. Marcus and I have a...

01:40:35.612 --> 01:40:37.071
Sit.

01:40:37.239 --> 01:40:40.950
Okay, Marcus and I have an extremely
powerful connection.

01:40:41.118 --> 01:40:42.952
It's like...

01:40:43.954 --> 01:40:45.121
...genetic.

01:40:45.539 --> 01:40:47.123
Genetic.

01:40:48.292 --> 01:40:50.084
Chemical?

01:40:50.586 --> 01:40:52.879
Whatever. I'm not a word person.

01:40:53.047 --> 01:40:58.301
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is,
I'm gonna need you now more than ever.

01:41:02.598 --> 01:41:04.307
I took a test.

01:41:06.143 --> 01:41:07.310
You're pregnant?

01:41:07.478 --> 01:41:09.395
I am.

01:41:10.481 --> 01:41:12.899
It's crazy.

01:41:13.067 --> 01:41:15.735
I mean... And good.

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:18.404
I mean, Marcus has been amazing.

01:41:18.572 --> 01:41:21.491
He is not what you think.

01:41:22.493 --> 01:41:26.454
Yes, yes, he's a caveman,
a total caveman.

01:41:26.622 --> 01:41:29.916
But one time, he made a little splint...

01:41:30.084 --> 01:41:32.960
...for this little chipmunk
with a broken leg.

01:41:33.128 --> 01:41:35.379
Is that not the sweetest thing
you've ever heard?

01:41:35.547 --> 01:41:37.048
Yeah.

01:41:37.216 --> 01:41:41.844
I gotta go. He's downstairs. He's waiting.
But I love you so much.

01:41:46.016 --> 01:41:48.351
It's crazy...

01:41:48.519 --> 01:41:50.812
...how things work out sometimes, huh?

01:41:54.358 --> 01:41:55.900
Bye.

01:42:12.835 --> 01:42:15.044
Is that Dex's jacket?

01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:23.136
What is it doing here?

01:42:24.221 --> 01:42:27.306
Oh, he just left it at the restaurant.
I must've picked it up.

01:42:27.474 --> 01:42:29.267
No.

01:42:29.726 --> 01:42:34.021
No, he didn't, because he was
wearing it today, so...

01:42:34.773 --> 01:42:40.862
What is it doing here?

01:42:41.989 --> 01:42:43.406
Darcy...

01:42:45.576 --> 01:42:47.034
Where is he?

01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.370
Darcy.

01:42:49.913 --> 01:42:55.251
Where is he?

01:42:56.128 --> 01:42:57.670
Dex?

01:42:57.838 --> 01:43:00.089
- Darcy. Please, let's just...
- Dex! Dex?

01:43:02.634 --> 01:43:04.927
- Dex?
- Darcy, no!

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:10.266
Dex!

01:43:12.144 --> 01:43:14.270
- You liar!
- Are you kidding me?

01:43:14.438 --> 01:43:16.272
You told me there was nobody in...

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:20.026
You are pregnant! Are you pretending
you're the wronged party here?

01:43:20.194 --> 01:43:21.944
Rachel?
How could you do this to me?

01:43:22.112 --> 01:43:24.947
I never wanted to hurt you, Darcy.
I never wanted to hurt you!

01:43:25.115 --> 01:43:28.618
- Rachel! How could you do this to me?
- Darcy, I never wanted to hurt you.

01:43:28.785 --> 01:43:31.704
I hate you. I hate you.

01:43:31.872 --> 01:43:39.378
I hate you.

01:43:39.546 --> 01:43:42.965
I never wanna speak to you again! Ever!

01:43:58.565 --> 01:44:01.442
Dude, you suck. I'm telling Mom.

01:44:10.202 --> 01:44:12.161
Wish me luck, dude.

01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:50.825
Hey.

01:44:55.998 --> 01:44:57.498
You look good.

01:44:58.166 --> 01:45:02.962
I know. Clearly, I'm gonna be one of those
girls who only carries in my belly.

01:45:07.050 --> 01:45:08.676
I bought him that shirt.

01:45:15.642 --> 01:45:17.560
Darcy, I'm really sorry.

01:45:18.061 --> 01:45:20.563
You're really sorry
you slept with my fiancÃ©?

01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:24.567
No, I'm sorry I hurt you.

01:45:28.739 --> 01:45:30.656
You always were jealous of me.

01:45:32.034 --> 01:45:34.327
Ever since I got into Notre Dame.

01:45:38.206 --> 01:45:39.582
You're right.

01:45:42.377 --> 01:45:44.587
Darcy, I miss you.

01:45:47.299 --> 01:45:49.300
Every day.

01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:05.066
You know, I'm the happiest I've ever been
in my life...

01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:07.234
...so whatever.

01:46:09.071 --> 01:46:10.905
I'm glad.

01:46:17.496 --> 01:46:19.288
Rachel?

01:46:20.832 --> 01:46:22.708
I am, though.

01:46:24.795 --> 01:46:26.128
Happy.

01:46:35.764 --> 01:46:37.264
Good.

01:47:11.133 --> 01:47:12.967
Hey. Where are you?

01:47:31.903 --> 01:47:33.863
I'll take this.

01:49:59.175 --> 01:50:01.302
What'd I miss? What did I miss?

01:50:01.511 --> 01:50:03.345
Okay, okay.

01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:04.763
Ethan.

01:50:07.183 --> 01:50:20.946
Ethan.

01:50:21.197 --> 01:50:22.865
Ethan?

01:50:23.033 --> 01:50:24.533
Ethan!
