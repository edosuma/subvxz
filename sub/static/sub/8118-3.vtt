WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
This programme contains some strong
language

00:11.000 --> 00:12.760
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:12.760 --> 00:15.280
welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys!

00:15.280 --> 00:18.600
# She's Mrs Brown

00:18.600 --> 00:21.720
# That's Mrs Brown

00:21.720 --> 00:25.440
# Our Mrs Brown. #

00:25.440 --> 00:27.160
So go on...

00:27.160 --> 00:30.440
Jacko says to the policeman
"I couldn't have been doing more

00:30.440 --> 00:34.480
"than 40, and, actually, after
the crossing we had to slow down.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.400
"We were only doing about 30".

00:36.400 --> 00:38.320
I'd say we were only doing 20.

00:38.320 --> 00:41.920
Jesus, hold on there, Winnie, before
you feckin' reverse into somebody.

00:43.560 --> 00:46.720
Jaysus, that beer's gone
through me like the Eurostar.

00:46.720 --> 00:48.920
I'm going to have to
go to the toilet.

00:59.880 --> 01:02.400
Hello!

01:02.400 --> 01:05.880
You just missed one of
Winnie's Jacko stories.

01:05.880 --> 01:09.640
She has millions of them
and they're all about Jacko.

01:09.640 --> 01:12.040
Of course, they've
been married years.

01:12.040 --> 01:16.160
PHONE RINGS
Hello? Cathy!

01:16.160 --> 01:18.200
Cathy, get that telephone!

01:18.200 --> 01:22.600
Ah, Mammy, the phone is portable!
Well, I'm not buckin' portable.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.800
Now get the phone.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.160
OK, Mammy.

01:27.160 --> 01:31.320
You know, I've heard
Winnie's stories, oh,

01:31.320 --> 01:35.200
a hundred times, but I listen
every time like it's the first time.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.920
That's what friends do, isn't it?

01:37.920 --> 01:44.240
Did I tell you that Jacko wants
to get a dog? No. Yeah, a Labrador.

01:44.240 --> 01:48.720
Oh, Jesus don't let him get a
Labrador, half the people who
get them go feckin' blind!

01:48.720 --> 01:50.760
Really? Yes!

01:53.880 --> 01:58.400
Winnie, it's your Sharon on the
phone. What the hell does she want?

01:58.400 --> 02:01.760
You can't even go round
the feckin' corner. Mammy!

02:01.760 --> 02:03.560
What? It's Mr McGoogan.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.760
Jacko? He's collapsed.
He's been taken into hospital.

02:06.760 --> 02:11.920
Oh, sweet little Jesus Christ,
Mother Mary, Joseph and the donkey
that took them all to Bethlehem!

02:13.960 --> 02:18.360
I've got to go to hospital, Agnes.
It's Jacko's gone in
with chest pains.

02:18.360 --> 02:21.280
Cathy told me. You're not going on
your own, Winnie, I'll go with you.

02:21.280 --> 02:23.920
Mammy, I'll go over and stay
with Sharon. She's very upset.

02:23.920 --> 02:28.520
Winnie, you don't be worrying.
These things often turn out
to be worse than they look!

02:31.160 --> 02:35.160
Hello? Hello?

02:46.800 --> 02:47.840
SHE SPITS

02:49.000 --> 02:50.040
DOOR CLOSES

02:52.960 --> 02:55.520
Ah, hello. It's a little chipmunk!

02:57.040 --> 03:00.360
Squirrel, Mammy, squirrel!

03:00.360 --> 03:03.080
So what are you promoting this week?
Chocolate bars.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.720
What has a hazelnut in every bite?

03:05.720 --> 03:09.520
Squirrel shit!
What's all this, love?

03:09.520 --> 03:12.400
Post and more stuff you
bought off the telly.

03:12.400 --> 03:16.920
Me Shake Weight
and me bikini-wax treatment.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.920
And me hair teaser!

03:18.920 --> 03:21.320
I wish you'd stop buying
that crap off the TV, Ma.

03:21.320 --> 03:25.000
Crap? Dermot, this is
first-class merchandise.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
And not available in the shops.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.640
Do you want a cup of tea, love?
Love one!

03:30.640 --> 03:32.280
Come on, nibble on me arse!

03:37.040 --> 03:39.760
It's been a busy morning.
Well, love, you know,

03:39.760 --> 03:42.000
you have to gather your nuts!

03:43.520 --> 03:46.120
Nah, running around trying
to get things done for the wedding,

03:46.120 --> 03:48.360
getting Buster measured for his
best man's suit.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.240
Buster?

03:50.240 --> 03:51.840
Buster's going to be your best man?

03:51.840 --> 03:55.160
Yeah. Buster Brady, that fecker? Yes!

03:55.160 --> 03:57.320
I thought you might
have picked Mark.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.200
I'd love to see my
two sons on the altar.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.040
Well, I wasn't best man at his
wedding. You were in prison, love.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.000
Still...I'd like Buster.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.520
Well, think about Mark.

04:13.640 --> 04:15.680
Tell me this.

04:15.680 --> 04:19.040
Have you consulted with Maria
on this 'Buster' decision?

04:19.040 --> 04:24.920
Nah! The bride picks the bridesmaids,
the groom picks the best man.
She won't mind.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.800
He's me best friend, Mammy.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.760
I'm sure you're right.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.960
Morning! Want a cup of tea, love?

04:31.960 --> 04:34.520
No, thanks. How's Winnie today?

04:34.520 --> 04:37.120
Winnie's putting on a brave face,
but she's worried, I can tell.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.480
Jacko needs a bypass. Of his heart.

04:42.280 --> 04:44.520
Doctors said he could
be waiting a while...

04:44.520 --> 04:46.120
five or six weeks, maybe a month.

04:48.960 --> 04:53.240
If she went private she could
have it tomorrow but Winnie
hasn't got that kind of money.

04:53.240 --> 04:56.440
That's disgraceful! Ah, that's
the way of the world, love.

04:56.440 --> 04:59.000
One law for the poor and
one law for the rest of us.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.760
But who knows? Maybe me or Winnie
will win the jackpot at the bingo

05:04.760 --> 05:06.920
and then Jacko can have
his operation tomorrow.

05:06.920 --> 05:09.440
Or you might win the lottery!

05:09.440 --> 05:11.400
Now don't start me off, Cathy.

05:11.400 --> 05:16.080
If we win the lottery, you can
forget about the operation.
We're gettin' two new fuckin' men.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.400
I'll see you later, Mammy.
Good luck. You should
get back to work as well.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.480
I'm sure there's a few
trees you haven't been up!

05:24.480 --> 05:28.400
Nah, I'm hanging on. Buster wants a
chat so I told him to call up here.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.760
Don't look at me like that.
I've gone straight!

05:35.480 --> 05:36.880
Hello, Mrs Brown.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.680
You, don't keep him too long.
He has a job to go to.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.240
I won't. Don't!

05:54.440 --> 05:56.520
Dermot, I'm going up
to make your bed.

05:56.520 --> 06:00.000
Will you stop stuffing them dirty
magazines under your mattress!

06:00.000 --> 06:03.040
It's nearly four-foot
thick at this stage.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.080
I only buy them for the articles.

06:06.080 --> 06:11.000
I only go to the supermarket
for the music! And you...

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
I'm keeping an eye on you...

06:14.000 --> 06:15.520
the good one!

06:15.520 --> 06:21.840
Jaysus, why's your ma
giving me such a hard time?

06:21.840 --> 06:24.360
She thinks you want to drag me
into a scam of some sort.

06:24.360 --> 06:25.960
Give a dog a bad name, what?

06:25.960 --> 06:28.440
So, what do ya want me for?
I've a brilliant scam, Dermot!

06:29.960 --> 06:32.800
Buster, are you mad?
I've gone straight.

06:32.800 --> 06:36.040
Just take a look, Dermot.
It's a doddle!

06:36.040 --> 06:37.960
A raffle for the boxing club?

06:37.960 --> 06:41.880
One euro a ticket, I put on the
tickets "5,000 euro first prize".

06:41.880 --> 06:46.040
I tell the people that if they win,
I'll call them. Then nobody wins...

06:46.040 --> 06:48.600
except us! It's foolproof!

06:48.600 --> 06:54.760
Not bad, Buster! Now I only got
a hundred tickets printed
just to try it out and Dermot...

06:54.760 --> 06:56.400
I sold them all in an hour!

06:56.400 --> 06:58.920
I made eighty euro!

07:01.440 --> 07:05.480
That's only eighty tickets.
I know, yeah. Well, l
I bought two books meself.

07:08.760 --> 07:12.000
5,000 euro, Dermot, it's not
to be bleedin' sneezed at!

07:13.160 --> 07:16.160
But...there's no raffle.
Ah, shite, yeah!

07:19.520 --> 07:21.280
Tease the hair.

07:21.280 --> 07:24.480
Tease the feckin' hair.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.160
Neh, neh, neh.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.720
How much did it cost to
get the tickets printed?

07:29.720 --> 07:32.200
90 euro.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.200
So you lost ten euro!

07:34.200 --> 07:37.080
Ah, this is a bleedin' rip off!

07:37.080 --> 07:39.760
I could do a few bob with
this wedding coming up.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.520
First of all we need to
get more tickets printed.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.320
More tickets! Thousands! Hundreds!

07:46.160 --> 07:50.160
Then we need to make it
something they've never
heard of, a club or something.

07:50.160 --> 07:54.120
The Dublin Home For Bewildered
Greyhounds And Whippets.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.800
Nice one. Leave it with me.
I'd better get back to work.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.920
Jacko's just lying there.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.560
He's not moving a muscle.

08:27.560 --> 08:32.280
It's a heart attack. He's hardly
going to doing the buckin' samba!

08:32.280 --> 08:35.080
Jesus, Winnie, he's not dead yet!

08:35.080 --> 08:37.880
You have to take a more
positive outlook on this.

08:37.880 --> 08:41.280
Start to look for
the most positive outcome.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.480
Yeah. Jacko's a fighter.
He'll be fine. How's Jacko?

08:44.480 --> 08:46.560
He's fucked. What?

08:46.560 --> 08:48.200
I'm only joking, Winnie.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.400
MOUTHS

08:51.480 --> 08:54.600
Maria! Hiya.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.360
Hello, love. What has you here?

08:56.360 --> 08:58.400
I looked in on Jacko
before I left the hospital.

08:58.400 --> 09:01.240
He's sitting up and he's starting
to get colour back in his face.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.800
He looked good. Ah, they always
get a lift just before the end.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.440
Mammy!

09:06.440 --> 09:08.320
I'm just trying to lighten the mood.

09:11.400 --> 09:16.560
Sorry, are we keeping you?
Have you to go and meet
your invisible boyfriend?

09:16.560 --> 09:18.880
I'd like to meet him. We all would.

09:18.880 --> 09:23.920
I'll never forget the night
I met your father, and don't
think I haven't fucking tried.

09:26.320 --> 09:29.680
That was at a party.
Sadie Brady's birthday.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.960
Right, Winnie. Oh, now
Sadie Brady... BOTH: Slapper.

09:34.520 --> 09:37.520
It didn't take long for her
private parts to go public.

09:37.520 --> 09:41.080
Her knickers were busier than
the escalator in Marks & Spencer's.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.160
Up, down, up, down.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.960
God, we arrived that night
dressed to the nines.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.200
We looked fantastic. Well, I did.

09:51.160 --> 09:54.000
We knocked at a door, we went in.
I never forget. What was it like?

09:54.000 --> 09:57.040
The place was hopping,
smoke everywhere, flashing lights.

09:57.040 --> 10:00.680
We were there three minutes before
we realised it was on fecking fire.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.560
I looked across the room
and there he was.

10:08.560 --> 10:12.520
Your father, Redser Brown. He was
standing in a corner on his own.

10:12.520 --> 10:15.160
He was shy? No, he was getting sick.

10:15.160 --> 10:19.920
He arrived at the party drunk
and somebody said,
"What will you have to drink?"

10:19.920 --> 10:22.480
He said,
"Give me a pint of anything."

10:22.480 --> 10:24.520
They gave him bucking Windolene.

10:24.520 --> 10:29.800
What? Do you know,
there was a sparkle off his shite
for two weeks after that.

10:33.320 --> 10:35.320
And it didn't smear!

10:39.520 --> 10:41.720
Oh, God.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.800
I took him home that night.
Oh, yes, I brought him home.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.200
It was lovely. His head was
just here on my shoulder.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.640
And I carried his legs.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.880
Listen, never mind me.
You married well. I did. She did.

10:55.880 --> 10:59.160
You should see the penis
on her Jacko. Agnes Brown!

10:59.160 --> 11:02.400
We used to go skinny dipping
on Portmarnock beach.

11:02.400 --> 11:05.400
We all lying there and Jacko
would come walking along the beach,

11:05.400 --> 11:07.440
dragging a big groove
in the sand behind him.

11:09.640 --> 11:13.920
Running into the water with his
surf board under his arm and
his penis under the other arm.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.800
It was love at first sight. Ah.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.040
What about your husband, Mrs Brown?

11:22.040 --> 11:25.160
What do you mean, Betty? Well,
when did you realise you loved him?

11:25.160 --> 11:27.200
Oh, Jesus. Love?

11:27.200 --> 11:29.720
Five or six months after he died.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.600
Your father was
best man at our wedding.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.920
Really? Yeah.
And Jacko was our best man.

11:38.920 --> 11:41.640
And that's the way it was.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.200
Just like Dermot and Buster.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.920
I'm sorry?

11:44.920 --> 11:49.000
Dermot, he's having Buster
as his best man, apparently.

12:02.240 --> 12:06.320
Buster, I'm telling you,
if the dog sees you playing
with her ball she'll go mad.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.840
6,235 euro.

12:12.840 --> 12:15.120
Well, at least that's
the prize money covered.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.720
Buster there is NO raffle.

12:22.560 --> 12:24.400
You bought more tickets, didn't you?

12:26.760 --> 12:28.600
What do yeah take me for?

12:28.600 --> 12:31.120
Yeah, two books.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.760
I'll give you your money back.

12:32.760 --> 12:36.400
No. It's all right.
I'll take my chances.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.760
BELL RINGS

12:38.760 --> 12:41.640
That's my boyfriend, Dermot.
Would you let him in?

12:45.560 --> 12:47.880
Hiya. He's here.

12:47.880 --> 12:50.600
OK. I'll be down in a minute.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.280
All right?

13:00.000 --> 13:02.320
So you're the boyfriend?

13:02.320 --> 13:04.600
I am, yeah.

13:04.600 --> 13:08.200
I can put this whole ball
in me mouth. Watch.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.400
Shut up, Buster.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.440
Howyeh?
I'm Cathy's brother, Dermot.

13:12.440 --> 13:14.360
Oh, hello, Dermot. What's the name?

13:14.360 --> 13:16.160
My name is Michael. Michael.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.000
But the lads at
the station call me Mick.

13:22.640 --> 13:26.080
Station? Are you a fireman?
I'm a detective.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.320
I'm off, Cathy.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.840
What was that all about?

13:34.840 --> 13:37.840
I have absolutely no idea.

13:37.840 --> 13:40.200
Oh! You look great.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.720
Thanks.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.600
Hello! We were just going.

13:45.600 --> 13:49.360
Well, hold your buckin' horses now.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.320
So, this is Slick Mick the Dick?

13:53.920 --> 13:55.760
This is Mick.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.800
This is me soon-to-be
sister-in-law, Maria. Hi.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.400
Hello. And this is Mammy.
Very nice to meet you.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.240
Oh, don't try your
fancy talk on me, son.

14:05.560 --> 14:08.520
Do you know that multiple
births run in our family?

14:08.520 --> 14:10.720
Yes, I had twins
and my sister had twins.

14:10.720 --> 14:15.280
Right, Mick, come on. We used
to call her Machine Gun Fanny.
Just go, Mick.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.680
I'm only telling you that
for your own sake, love,

14:17.680 --> 14:21.560
in case you're thinking of
getting your leg over her.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.520
You'll be up to your neck in kids.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.640
He seems like a nice chap.

14:29.240 --> 14:32.120
Tea, Maria? Tia Maria!

14:35.520 --> 14:39.760
So, Maria, how are you feeling
with the wedding so close?

14:39.760 --> 14:44.320
Actually, I'm a bit nervous.
I was too. Nervous of the unknown.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.800
Ha-ha!

14:46.800 --> 14:52.200
But I can give you a heads-up.
About a week after the honeymoon,
he'll start looking for S-E-K-S.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.400
A week?
Yes, a week. They rush at it.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.640
Don't fall into the trap.

14:59.640 --> 15:02.800
It starts the whole thing and
then he wants to play games.

15:02.800 --> 15:06.400
Charge of the Light Brigade
was the one I hated.

15:06.400 --> 15:10.320
He'd start one side of the
room, naked, and I'd stand
the other and he'd go, "Charge!"

15:13.080 --> 15:15.520
I missed him one night.
He went out the feckin' window!

15:20.960 --> 15:23.760
If you'd have seen my face
stuck on that door knob.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.200
What you need to do is you
need to know the signals.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.600
Signals? Signals. My favourite
position in bed was back-to-back.

15:35.800 --> 15:39.200
The signal for that is poke, poke.
Poke, poke, poke. Poke, boy.

15:39.200 --> 15:42.040
It's like having Ken Doherty
behind you with no chalk on his cue.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.760
Mrs Brown, really,
you don't have to.

15:43.760 --> 15:46.720
No, you need to know this, love.
The other signal is not bad.

15:46.720 --> 15:50.320
It's when he starts brushing his
teeth and gargling in the bathroom.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.440
He's preparing himself. Ha-ha!

15:53.440 --> 15:57.160
I only have to hear...
GARGLES

15:57.160 --> 16:02.000
..and my nip...
No, really, I understand.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.600
Oh, OK. Hello, love.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.560
Hiya.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.960
Would you like a cup of tea, love?

16:13.960 --> 16:17.000
Er, I don't know, Ma.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.440
Are you going to hang on?

16:19.440 --> 16:23.320
So, Dermot, have you decided who
your best man is going to be yet?

16:23.320 --> 16:25.720
Cocoa, cocoa? Yet?

16:25.720 --> 16:29.000
There was never any doubt about who
would be best man - my best friend.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.920
Buster Brady? Is right.

16:32.680 --> 16:36.160
Buster Brady is not going
to be best man at my wedding.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.840
Horlicks will calm everybody down.

16:37.840 --> 16:42.880
Well, that's funny, because he
is going to be best man at mine,
so I must be marrying someone else.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.000
Do, then.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.240
I can do it in a take-away cup.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.520
Maria!
DOOR SLAMS

16:49.520 --> 16:55.720
As Forrest Gump's mother would say,
there's an awful smell of
shrimp off that. What?

16:55.720 --> 16:58.200
Her in the film Brokeback Mountain.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.640
Never mind. Run, Forrest, run.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.440
I love Tom Selleck.

17:10.240 --> 17:14.040
Seven-letter word
meaning constipation.

17:14.040 --> 17:17.280
Starting in N and ending in N.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.320
Ah! Nnnnnnn.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.880
Hello, Winnie.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.720
How are you, pet?
What brings you over?

17:33.240 --> 17:36.120
Just sitting over there
on my own, worrying.

17:36.120 --> 17:39.800
When you're sitting on your
own there's two things you
don't want, and one is worry.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.440
The other is feckin' Panorama.

17:45.120 --> 17:49.680
Anyway, maybe one of us will win the
jackpot at the bingo then Jacko can
have his operation in the morning.

17:49.680 --> 17:53.440
Or the raffle. What fuckin' raffle?

17:53.440 --> 17:56.920
The Dublin Home For Bewildered
Greyhounds And Whippets.

17:56.920 --> 18:00.640
5,000 euro first prize, Agnes.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.320
I bought ten books.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.280
Winnie, you feckin' eejit.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.240
Half them things are a scam.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.480
I had a fella here at Christmas
knocked at the door.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.920
Would I buy a ticket
for a raffle for orphans?

18:11.920 --> 18:14.400
With my luck I'd fuckin' win one.

18:17.760 --> 18:21.320
What you need is something
to take your mind off
the whole hospital thing.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.480
And I have just the feckin' thing.

18:23.480 --> 18:26.400
What? Come on.
Wait till you see this.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.320
You can help me with
my bikini wax thing.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.000
You'd better do that upstairs
in the bathroom.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.480
No, no, Cathy is going to have
a bath. No, we'll do it here.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.480
Agnes, you can't do it here.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.040
Someone might walk in on you.

18:41.040 --> 18:45.760
You're right.
I'd look feckin' stupid.

18:45.760 --> 18:49.160
I've an idea. What? We'll do it
in the cupboard. Feck off, Agnes.

18:49.160 --> 18:53.160
Come on, Winnie, get into
the cupboard. For God's sake.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.680
It's only for the craic.

19:00.120 --> 19:02.200
It's dark in here.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.240
Jesus, Winnie! What?
I've no feeling in me left leg.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.240
That's MY leg, Agnes!

19:09.280 --> 19:11.040
This is feckin' ridiculous.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.680
Hold on, I've an idea.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.720
You take the instructions
and go out and read them out to me.

19:15.720 --> 19:19.600
Oh, that's better. In the light.
OK, love? Are you ready, pet?

19:19.600 --> 19:20.840
I'm ready whenever you are.

19:20.840 --> 19:24.200
"Expose the relevant area."

19:24.200 --> 19:26.640
What the feck does that mean?

19:26.640 --> 19:28.920
Get your knickers down.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.800
Ha-ha! No sooner said than done.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.680
OK, go ahead, Winnie.

19:37.680 --> 19:42.720
"Open the container and spread
the cold wax using the spatula."

19:44.920 --> 19:47.840
Oh, the smell!

19:47.840 --> 19:51.320
Is the cold wax smelly?
I can't get the feckin' thing open.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.000
Hold on, I have it.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I have it. All right.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.480
Jesus, it's freezing.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.600
OK, Winnie, I'm spread.

20:06.280 --> 20:12.600
"Remove the backing from
the sticky tape and apply
it firmly to the area."

20:12.600 --> 20:15.640
SHE REMOVES THE BACKING

20:15.640 --> 20:19.840
Jesus, now I'm trying to go
around feckin' corners here.

20:19.840 --> 20:23.760
Argh, it's stuck to me arse!

20:23.760 --> 20:27.600
Are you all right, Agnes?
Hold on, hold on.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.520
OK, I have it. OK, now what?

20:29.520 --> 20:34.240
Now wait for three minutes
and pull the tape off briskly.

20:34.240 --> 20:37.200
That means fast. Yank it off.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.960
Winnie, I can't see
me feckin' watch.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.600
Well, count to 180. OK.

20:42.600 --> 20:47.840
(QUICKLY) One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven...
PHONE RINGS

20:47.840 --> 20:50.680
Hello, Mrs McGoogan.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.840
Dermot's not here, pet.
Come back later, love.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.840
I'm just leaving this here for him.
He told me to put it in
the cupboard.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.800
No, no! Put it in the kitchen, pet.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.320
Go on, put it in the kitchen.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.600
It's Buster. Close the door.
You're blowing the arse off me!

21:07.120 --> 21:09.640
Hiya, Winnie.
Who was that at the door? It was me.

21:09.640 --> 21:11.720
Are you delighted to see me?

21:11.720 --> 21:13.520
Oh, piss off, Buster.

21:14.520 --> 21:18.960
Winnie, where's Mammy?
She's not here, love. 73, 74, 75...

21:18.960 --> 21:20.640
She is. She's in there.

21:20.640 --> 21:24.680
No, she's not.
120... She was, but she not.

21:24.680 --> 21:27.720
154...155... That sounds
like her voice.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.240
It's not. Shut up, you.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.400
Winnie, where is she?

21:31.400 --> 21:36.600
178, 179, 180.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.000
RIPPING

21:39.520 --> 21:43.360
SCREAMING

22:25.880 --> 22:29.160
Are you all right, Mammy?

22:31.200 --> 22:34.880
No. I feel like there's a
hedgehog living in my knickers.

22:44.960 --> 22:48.000
Hello, Winnie. Go on in.
I'll follow you in.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.520
Little bastards.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.560
What's all this about?
PHONE RINGS

23:11.560 --> 23:13.240
You're about to see.

23:19.440 --> 23:23.320
Maria, thanks for coming over.
What's going on? That's
exactly what I was saying.

23:23.320 --> 23:26.200
What's wrong? Is Jacko all right?
Oh, Winnie, shut up.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.600
Not every bit of drama in
this series is about Jacko.

23:29.600 --> 23:30.880
Sorry.

23:30.880 --> 23:34.080
Maria, I want nothing more
than to make you happy.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.680
I've asked Mark to be my best man

23:37.680 --> 23:40.280
and he's agreed to do it. Yep.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.840
I'm proud to do it.
He'll be great at it as well.

23:42.840 --> 23:46.280
I've spoken to Buster
and he has no problem with it.

23:46.280 --> 23:48.560
Well, what I said...

23:48.560 --> 23:51.680
Oh, Dermot, that's fantastic.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.640
No, no, hold on a minute.

23:53.640 --> 23:57.200
No, it's not fantastic.
Now just hold on there.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.800
Maria, I know you don't have the
highest opinion of this little shit.

24:03.240 --> 24:07.880
When you told your family that
you were marrying my son, what
was it your cousin Bethany said?

24:07.880 --> 24:09.440
She said,

24:09.440 --> 24:11.600
"You're not marrying
that scumbag, are you?"

24:11.600 --> 24:13.200
Exactly.

24:13.200 --> 24:18.280
And tell me, Maria, on the day
of the wedding what will that
cat-faced little bitch be doing?

24:18.280 --> 24:20.120
She's my bridesmaid.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.240
But she's my only cousin. Fine.

24:22.240 --> 24:23.880
That's your choice,
that makes it fine.

24:23.880 --> 24:28.520
Well, Dermot and Buster have been
best friends since their arses
were the size of shirt buttons.

24:31.080 --> 24:34.440
Best friends, Maria.
That has to count for something.

24:34.440 --> 24:38.280
If you're lucky, you'll marry your
best friend, just like Winnie did,

24:38.280 --> 24:41.800
and that's more important than
all the lovey-dovey stuff.
So here's the deal.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.760
If you've any sense of
loyalty about you at all,

24:44.760 --> 24:50.720
you'll simply ask Dermot who
he'd like to have by his side

24:50.720 --> 24:53.640
to witness the most important
decision of his life.

24:56.760 --> 25:00.600
Your mother's right, Dermot.
I'm sorry.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.720
Who would you like as your best man?

25:05.240 --> 25:06.960
Mark...

25:06.960 --> 25:08.800
I'm sorry.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.440
Buster...

25:17.000 --> 25:19.440
..will you be my best man?

25:19.440 --> 25:21.600
I do.

25:24.880 --> 25:29.400
If you even dream about it,
you'll wake up and apologise!

25:29.400 --> 25:35.120
Well, that's that, then.
No, that's not that then.
There's more thats to that now.

25:35.120 --> 25:38.680
Winnie McGoogan, my dearest friend.

25:38.680 --> 25:42.600
Winnie, we've been together
through thick and thin. We have.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.200
I was always thin.

25:46.480 --> 25:51.640
Winnie, when my Redser lost
his job and we had no money,
you were there by my side.

25:51.640 --> 25:55.640
I was. And when Redser went in
to have his left leg removed,

25:55.640 --> 25:57.760
you were there by my side. True.

25:57.760 --> 26:00.400
And when they
took away his right leg,

26:00.400 --> 26:02.120
you were there right beside me.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.680
Yes. And the night Redser died,

26:04.680 --> 26:08.720
where were you? Tell them.
By your side, Agnes.

26:08.720 --> 26:10.720
By my side.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.560
Winnie, you're a fuckin' jinx.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.600
But you're my best friend.

26:22.600 --> 26:26.800
Now, tell me, Winnie,
if Jacko had his operation in
the morning, how much would it cost?

26:26.800 --> 26:29.600
Jesus, Agnes, it's a lot
more than I could afford.

26:29.600 --> 26:31.160
Well, this could be your lucky day.

26:31.160 --> 26:35.520
Why? Dermot's found out the result
of the raffle. (Oh, Jesus.)

26:35.520 --> 26:37.680
I have?

26:37.680 --> 26:40.560
Yes, you have, Mr Dublin
Greyhound and WHIPPETS!

26:42.520 --> 26:45.080
So come on, son,
announce the result.

26:45.080 --> 26:48.680
Oh, yeah, the raffle. Yes,
the in-the-kitchen-in-the-red-box
raffle.

26:48.680 --> 26:52.000
The result is... Hang on a minute.
Let me get my tickets out.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.760
Fire away, Dermot.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.360
The winner of the 5,000 euro...

27:05.360 --> 27:08.560
And the 1,000 euro bonus. What!

27:11.520 --> 27:15.160
..and the 1,000 euro bonus
is Winnie McGoogan.

27:18.440 --> 27:20.400
You see, Winnie, I told you.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.840
Everything works out just
the way it was supposed to. Yes.

27:22.840 --> 27:27.840
You can buy us all a drink. I will.
Let's all get down to Foleys and
get this feckin' party started.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.680
# When I wake up
When I wake up

27:29.680 --> 27:31.320
# I know I'm going to be

27:31.320 --> 27:34.240
# I'm going to be the man
who wakes up next to you

27:34.240 --> 27:36.720
# And when I go out

27:36.720 --> 27:41.320
# I know I'm gonna be, I'm gonna
be... # I'll follow yous down.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.840
Go on.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.320
Agnes.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.920
Jesus Christ, Winnie.

27:57.920 --> 28:03.400
You know you were saying about us
two marrying our best friends? Yes?

28:03.400 --> 28:06.840
Well, I didn't marry my best friend.

28:06.840 --> 28:09.800
I moved in beside her.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.640
I wonder who that fecking was.

28:20.560 --> 28:22.280
Goodnight, friends.

28:24.720 --> 28:30.160
# Say hello to the queen
of Dublin town

28:30.160 --> 28:36.600
# As the best mum of all
She wears the crown

28:36.600 --> 28:39.840
# Mother hen watching all her chicks

28:39.840 --> 28:42.680
# A sassy old lady full of tricks

28:42.680 --> 28:48.360
# It's a safe bet
She'd never let life get her down

28:48.360 --> 28:51.160
# She's Mrs Brown

28:51.160 --> 28:54.960
# That's Mrs Brown

28:54.960 --> 28:56.640
# Our Mrs Brown. #
