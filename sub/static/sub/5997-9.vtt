NARRATOR: And so, we come to
perhaps the bloodiest chapter

00:39.080 --> 00:42.516
in the long and violent
history of the Midwest region.

00:42.800 --> 00:46.430
And here I'm speaking of
Luverne, Minnesota, 1979,

00:46.720 --> 00:48.870
commonly referred
to by laypeople

00:48.960 --> 00:51.429
as the Massacre
at Sioux Falls.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.393
Readers will know
that I've chosen

00:53.480 --> 00:55.630
to file this case
as a Minnesota crime

00:55.880 --> 00:57.154
even though
most of the murders

00:57.240 --> 00:59.629
took place in North
and then South Dakota.

00:59.840 --> 01:03.674
But I believe the key to understanding
this complex and nuanced crime

01:03.760 --> 01:07.276
is to look at the butcher and
small-town beautician at its center.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.237
Ed and Peggy Blumquist

01:09.440 --> 01:14.560
were just 29 years old on the
night their lives changed forever.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.593
We have no birth certificate,

03:00.080 --> 03:02.390
no tribal or family history.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.111
He was the Gerhardts' man,

03:07.280 --> 03:09.396
or he had been, until...

03:09.480 --> 03:11.676
DODD: Jesus Christ,
ya mongrel.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.757

get me to a goddamn hospital.

Minnesota two days past.

They don't look
like much.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.120
You don't look
like much.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.869
We're realized.

04:26.840 --> 04:27.910
What?
What's she sayin'?

04:28.280 --> 04:29.395

04:29.880 --> 04:30.870
CHENEY: Realized what?

04:31.320 --> 04:32.549
That you're up
a tree without a paddle?

04:32.640 --> 04:34.358
It's a tri-state
deal here, J.C.

04:34.560 --> 04:35.959
We're talkin'
bodies for miles.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.271
Not just some dead
hooligan in a cabin.

04:38.720 --> 04:39.710
It's a goddamn shootin' war.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.319
Yeah, I know.
We got 'em, too.

04:41.480 --> 04:42.515
Organized crime?

04:43.040 --> 04:45.475
What the heck are you doing
here with... With that one?

04:45.840 --> 04:48.036
The eldest
Gerhardt boy, Dodd?

04:48.360 --> 04:50.590
He came to
the house after Peggy

04:50.680 --> 04:53.035
and she knocked
him on his ass.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.759
So, I thought

04:55.840 --> 04:59.196
maybe trade him back to the
family and make a deal for us to go.

04:59.720 --> 05:00.755
A fresh start.

05:01.520 --> 05:02.590
We're on a journey.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.310
Can we just...

05:05.760 --> 05:08.639
While we're skippin'
down memory lane, here,

05:08.720 --> 05:11.280
it's worth notin' that the
Gerhardt Indian is out there free,

05:11.360 --> 05:12.873
probably callin'
for reinforcements.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.638
So, if I were us...

05:14.720 --> 05:15.676
I stabbed him.

05:15.760 --> 05:16.750
...I'd get them
outta here.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.116
Or cover 'em in bacon
and leave 'em for the dogs.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.190
I stabbed him!

05:20.360 --> 05:21.350
The Indian.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.833
He wanted a haircut and I
stabbed him with the scissors.

05:27.000 --> 05:27.990
In the back.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.400

look like the gang

05:32.840 --> 05:34.751

doesn't she?

05:35.080 --> 05:36.070
Our beautician.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.517
It's worth mentionin',
you know,

05:38.600 --> 05:40.193
in the spirit
of full disclosure,

05:43.200 --> 05:44.190
my plan,

05:44.920 --> 05:45.910
it worked.

05:46.600 --> 05:47.829
I made a deal for Dodd.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.399
HANK: With, what,
the Gerhardts?

05:49.720 --> 05:51.757
No, they wouldn't.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.592
They said they
weren't interested.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.318
Well, that's what
they told me.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.953
So, I called
Kansas City.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.030
You did what?

06:00.120 --> 06:02.396
I spoke to this
fella, Milligan,

06:02.480 --> 06:03.959
and he said he'd protect us

06:04.400 --> 06:05.549
if we gave him Dodd.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.435
So, have a meeting
set at 8:00 a.m.

06:08.520 --> 06:09.510
HANK: Where?

06:10.640 --> 06:11.630

06:11.880 --> 06:12.950
They're comin' here?

06:13.840 --> 06:15.558
Yes, sir.
To the Motor Motel.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.155
We need to get these two into custody
now. Where's the nearest precinct?

06:38.040 --> 06:39.030
Tell "em.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.039
We can't vouch for the safety
of the precinct, is the thing.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.431
What kinda chicken shit
outfit you runnin' here, J.C.?

06:45.520 --> 06:46.510
Zip it.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.835
I don't drive
to your backyard

06:47.920 --> 06:49.593
and talk about
how all your heads are flat.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.472
What does that mean, you
can't vouch for the safety?

06:51.800 --> 06:53.154
We got graft,
I'm sayin'.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.829
Money changes hands.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.357
Used to be Gerhardt money,
now it's Kansas City.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.519
Corruption.
POLICEWOMAN: Allegedly.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.310
But...

07:01.440 --> 07:02.953
Well, you bring
these two into custody

07:03.040 --> 07:05.156
can't guarantee they won't
hear about it down in Kansas City.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.994
And you know they'll send,
like, an army.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.633
So, we take 'em north,

07:09.720 --> 07:11.836

got their heads on straight.

07:12.000 --> 07:12.990

07:13.440 --> 07:14.510

07:15.200 --> 07:17.350
Well, wherever we're takin'
'em, we need to go soon.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.557
I've been under siege once
this week. Not really interested...

07:19.640 --> 07:20.675
There's a third way.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.350
We wire the redhead,

07:23.360 --> 07:25.590
send him into the meetin'
with this Milligan fella,

07:25.680 --> 07:27.193
get the conspiracy on tape.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.518

we bust the whole operation.

You saw 'em.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.992
Well, they're doin'
better than us, so far.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.799

Believe me. Wearin' a wire?

07:47.720 --> 07:50.314
They'll make the effort if they
think it'll keep 'em off death row.

fella. It's not amateur hour.

16:59.280 --> 17:03.035
I got a Minnesota State cop on
the line lookin' for Sheriff Larsson.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.229
Okay.
Put him through.

17:08.079 --> 17:09.912
LOU: Listen,
he's in a red Eldorado.

17:10.800 --> 17:11.869
Who's that?

17:12.560 --> 17:13.516
The Indian.

17:13.599 --> 17:14.635
Shot the clerk

17:14.760 --> 17:16.512
at the convenience store,
the one who called him in.

17:17.440 --> 17:18.999
Looks like our man
patched up his scissor wound

17:19.079 --> 17:20.638
and took the clerk's car.

17:24.119 --> 17:25.519
Yeah, kid, it's me.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.117
We're headed...
What is it?

17:29.400 --> 17:30.470
The Motor Motel.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.471
We're headed to
the Motor Motel.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.035
The plan is to
ditch the prowlers

17:35.120 --> 17:38.511
and then hole up for the
night under a low profile.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.636
And then,
prep Ed for the sting.

17:41.880 --> 17:42.870
Listen, you need to...

17:43.320 --> 17:45.038
I gotta bad feelin'
here and they're...

17:45.720 --> 17:47.040
I'm bein' run outta town.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.359
But you need to
watch yourselves.

17:49.680 --> 17:50.715
This thing ain't over.

17:51.000 --> 17:51.990
POLICEMAN: Here,
give me that thing.

17:53.560 --> 17:54.630
Listen, Trooper,

17:54.760 --> 17:56.956
we appreciate your giddy up
on this this thing,

17:57.040 --> 17:59.031
but we're not fresh
off the boat, here.

17:59.760 --> 18:00.989
If these fellas
wanna tussle

18:01.320 --> 18:02.469
they're gonna find
out a thing or two

18:02.600 --> 18:04.273
about what
a Dakota man can do.

18:04.840 --> 18:05.830
Yeah...

18:05.920 --> 18:08.594
Take a seat on the bench,
is what I'm sayin', junior.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.830
We'll handle it from here.
Over and out.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.672
POLICEMAN: Unload the prisoners,
and ditch the prowlers around back.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.717
HANK: Hey, Captain?
Talk to you for a second?

18:40.200 --> 18:41.429
Your man
was outta line.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.599
Yes, sir.
Yeah. He...

18:43.720 --> 18:44.915
He was havin'
a feelin'.

18:45.560 --> 18:46.675
This mess
has got us...

18:46.760 --> 18:48.239
CHENEY: You Minnesota
boys don't got much

18:48.320 --> 18:49.799
in the way a backbone,
now do you?

18:52.400 --> 18:53.799
Well, now,
I wouldn't say that.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.677
Just like to
think things through.

18:58.680 --> 18:59.750
Army?

19:00.680 --> 19:01.875
Yes, sir.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.197
HANK: Liberated France
in the Great War.

19:06.440 --> 19:07.430
Not singlehandedly,

19:07.520 --> 19:09.557
but I like to think they couldn't
have done it without me.

19:09.640 --> 19:12.200
Well, then you know it's the
generals that do the thinkin'

19:12.920 --> 19:15.309
and everybody else
just says "how high?"

19:17.280 --> 19:19.271
Not gonna debate
the merits of top-down

19:19.360 --> 19:20.919
decision makin'
with you, Captain,

19:22.320 --> 19:25.756
except to say, I had
a lieutenant in the war

19:26.680 --> 19:30.116
and he told Eisenhower
to go to hell once,

19:30.200 --> 19:32.760
on account of his orders
would have got us all killed.

19:33.880 --> 19:36.633
I send that man
a card every Christmas,

19:37.680 --> 19:38.715
"cause I can.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.434
Stay or go.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.549
Makes no difference to me.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.632
But tomorrow, I'm takin'
the fight to the enemy.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.274
Tell Simone
to come see me.

20:09.520 --> 20:10.874
I wanna apologize
for yesterday.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.398
She left in a hurry

20:17.160 --> 20:18.230
when you were took.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.319
Don't think
she's back yet.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.230
Sorry, Mrs., but...

20:28.120 --> 20:29.872
What? What is it?

20:30.840 --> 20:31.875
It's for your son,
ma'am.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.311
Supposed to talk
to him directly.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.390
It's okay.

20:36.680 --> 20:37.750
We'll go
into the barn.

20:38.000 --> 20:38.990
No.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.515
No secrets here.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.480
Well, what is it, kid?
Spit it out.

20:46.760 --> 20:47.830

20:48.320 --> 20:49.879
He's on the phone.
Hanzee?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.035
Says he found Dodd.

20:58.680 --> 20:59.670
Is he alive?

21:00.000 --> 21:00.990
Yes, ma'am.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.119
They got him,
but he's breathin'.

21:05.920 --> 21:06.955
Who's got him?

21:09.200 --> 21:12.909
NARRATOR: Historians of the region
have long debated the next two words

21:13.040 --> 21:15.395
spoken by
the Gerhardts' Native man.

21:16.040 --> 21:19.829
When, exactly, did he decide to
betray the rest of his employers?

21:20.160 --> 21:23.437
Yes, he had executed
Dodd Gerhardt in cold blood,

21:23.520 --> 21:26.353
but at what point did he
decide to finish the job?

21:31.200 --> 21:32.315
Was it here?

21:33.920 --> 21:35.035
Or maybe earlier.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.475
BEAR: ...you gotta do is
be straight with us.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.310
I'm straight.

21:38.480 --> 21:41.916
NARRATOR: It's certainly possible
that the move was spontaneous.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.399
Who knows, maybe it'd been
building inside of him

21:45.480 --> 21:47.471
since Otto Gerhardt
took him off the street

21:47.560 --> 21:48.914
when he was eight years old.

21:49.360 --> 21:50.316
Whatever the answer,

21:50.400 --> 21:54.598
when Floyd Gerhardt asked who
it was that was holding her son,

21:54.680 --> 21:56.273

21:56.440 --> 21:57.430
Kansas City.

21:57.560 --> 21:58.914

21:59.640 --> 22:01.119
It was an ambush.
Luverne.

22:01.240 --> 22:03.231
Butcher grabbed Dodd,
fled the state.

22:04.800 --> 22:05.790
Why?

22:06.560 --> 22:08.551
I tracked them to
a motel in Sioux Falls.

22:09.640 --> 22:12.075
They got numbers, but
they're not expectin' anything.

22:12.480 --> 22:13.629
FLOYD: I'll be there
in three hours.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.390
HANZEE: No, ma'am.

22:16.160 --> 22:19.437
You send Bear and a dozen men,
we can bring him home.

22:20.520 --> 22:21.874
Are you tellin' me
what to do?

22:23.080 --> 22:24.115
No.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.677
Just can't vouch for
your safety is all.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.359
Three times I sent
men to do a job.

22:29.360 --> 22:30.759
Three times they
come back unfinished.

22:31.720 --> 22:32.869
I'll handle this myself.

22:33.680 --> 22:34.750
Yes, ma'am.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.990
We'll lay waste to 'em
in the devil's hours.

like losin' some money.

36:01.120 --> 36:02.349
(GROANS)

36:07.200 --> 36:08.349
Screw this.

36:33.120 --> 36:34.997
Well, first of all, son,

36:36.040 --> 36:38.839
were there other people
in the pool at the time?

37:12.920 --> 37:13.876
(GROANS)

37:14.000 --> 37:14.990
No!

37:15.440 --> 37:16.430
(GROANS)

37:21.280 --> 37:22.270
(GROANS)

37:25.320 --> 37:26.310
(GRUNTS)

37:33.520 --> 37:34.794
(GUNSHOT)

37:39.000 --> 37:39.990
Brother?

37:41.880 --> 37:42.870
Brother?

37:43.040 --> 37:44.030
(COCKS)

37:56.680 --> 37:57.750
(PANTS)

37:57.840 --> 37:58.989
All clear.

37:59.800 --> 38:00.870
All clear!

38:07.360 --> 38:08.509
BEN: Oh, Christ.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.279
It's Rapid City
all over again.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.390
(GRUNTS)

38:12.840 --> 38:13.830
Brother?

38:35.360 --> 38:36.430
MAN: They're cops!

38:44.240 --> 38:45.389
(GASPS)

38:50.720 --> 38:51.915
(GROANS)

39:12.760 --> 39:14.273
No!
(GUNSHOT)

39:40.000 --> 39:41.274
(YELLING)

39:49.120 --> 39:50.315
(GRUNTING)

40:03.800 --> 40:04.870
(GROANS)

40:15.680 --> 40:17.114
(GRUNTING)

40:29.520 --> 40:32.911
NARRATOR: Then, as he killed
both friend and foe alike,

40:33.200 --> 40:35.840
it became clear
that Hanzee was on a mission.

40:36.480 --> 40:39.438
To find the beautician and
her butcher's assistant husband,

40:39.520 --> 40:42.114
and silence them
once and for all.

40:42.360 --> 40:46.479
Again, the question of why has
puzzled historians for decades.

40:46.760 --> 40:49.434
It's true that they had seen
him execute Dodd Gerhardt,

40:49.520 --> 40:50.749
and that they were
the only ones left

40:50.840 --> 40:53.309
who could reveal his treachery
for what it was.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.352
But maybe
the reason was deeper.

40:55.560 --> 40:57.392
PEGGY: Professional, you said.
HANZEE: Yeah.

40:58.360 --> 40:59.555
Tired of this life.

41:00.520 --> 41:02.511
NARRATOR: The fact that he had
shown his true self

41:02.600 --> 41:04.750
to them in a moment
of vulnerability.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.274
(GRUNTING)

41:18.240 --> 41:19.799
(GRUNTING)

42:06.600 --> 42:08.113
(SCREAMING)

42:08.400 --> 42:09.390
Oh!

42:09.480 --> 42:10.675
Gotta make
a break for it, hon.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.111
Are you...
Are you seein' this?

42:20.320 --> 42:21.799
It's just
a flyin' saucer, Ed.

42:21.880 --> 42:22.870
We gotta go.

42:52.840 --> 42:54.160
(GUNSHOTS)

43:12.360 --> 43:13.475
MAN: Officer down!

43:15.680 --> 43:16.954
(PANTING)

43:21.440 --> 43:22.510
(HANK GROANS)

43:32.560 --> 43:34.153
I should have
gone home with you.

43:35.520 --> 43:37.033
Turns out I didn't go.

43:39.200 --> 43:40.349
HANK: Grateful for that.

43:53.600 --> 43:54.590
(COCKS)

43:56.080 --> 43:57.070
MIKE: What the...

43:59.360 --> 44:00.873
(SIREN WAILING)

44:03.400 --> 44:04.390
Okay, then.

44:28.960 --> 44:30.792
Yeah, all right.
(GROANS)

44:34.600 --> 44:36.273
Peggy? Ed?

44:38.080 --> 44:39.070
On the run,

44:39.760 --> 44:41.433
with the Indian in pursuit.

44:43.280 --> 44:44.270
Go.

44:46.480 --> 44:47.470
I can make it.

44:51.440 --> 44:52.430
Dinner Sunday?

44:53.360 --> 44:54.350
(LAUGHS)

44:54.440 --> 44:57.637
I'll be there in
a suit of armor.

45:12.280 --> 45:14.157
(SIRENS WAILING)

45:23.480 --> 45:26.359
(SINGING) Thought it was a nightmare

45:27.000 --> 45:29.230
Lord, it's all so true

45:30.640 --> 45:33.758
They told me,
"Don't go walkin' slow

45:34.120 --> 45:36.509
"The devil's on the loose"

45:37.120 --> 45:39.589
Better run through the jungle

45:40.680 --> 45:43.274
Better run through the jungle

45:44.320 --> 45:46.880
Better run through the jungle

45:48.000 --> 45:50.913
Whoa, don't look back to see

45:52.320 --> 45:55.517
Thought I heard a rumblin'

45:55.880 --> 45:58.190
Callin' to my name

45:59.240 --> 46:02.551
Two hundred million
guns are loaded

46:02.800 --> 46:05.440
Satan cries, "Take aim!"

46:05.840 --> 46:08.354
Better run through the jungle

46:09.400 --> 46:12.074
Better run through the jungle

46:13.040 --> 46:15.554
Better run through the jungle

46:16.680 --> 46:19.194
Whoa, don't look back

46:20.960 --> 46:22.359
Ooh

46:39.120 --> 46:41.714
Over on the mountain

46:42.640 --> 46:44.950
Thunder magic spoke

46:46.040 --> 46:49.635
“Let the people
know my wisdom,

46:49.720 --> 46:51.836
"Fill the land with smoke."

46:52.560 --> 46:55.279
Better run through the jungle

46:56.280 --> 46:59.272
Whoa, don't look back to see
