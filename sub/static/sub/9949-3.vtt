Anyone watching thinking
we know fuck all

00:04.900 --> 00:09.139
about knowing fuck all about owt,
needs to watch their back.

00:09.237 --> 00:12.356
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:12.357 --> 00:14.756
sending prices sky-high, literally,

00:14.757 --> 00:18.676
literally taking the grass
from its own roots!

00:18.677 --> 00:20.836
And now you've got
your condemnation,

00:20.837 --> 00:24.596
Liberals noshing Tories like
altar boys picking dimps up!

00:24.597 --> 00:28.076
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

00:28.077 --> 00:31.956
Is revolution a word
or was it never?

00:31.957 --> 00:33.676
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:33.677 --> 00:36.716
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:36.717 --> 00:40.756
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:40.757 --> 00:44.116
and they charge us for water!

00:44.117 --> 00:48.796
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:48.797 --> 00:52.036
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times,

00:52.037 --> 00:55.116
yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak!

00:55.117 --> 00:57.236
It's not theirs any more!

00:57.237 --> 01:00.876
This is our England now!

01:00.877 --> 01:02.716
Paaaarty!

Girl! Where's my coffee?

02:11.717 --> 02:13.397
Mm, nice.

02:21.517 --> 02:24.036
I just don't like
chucking stuff out.

02:24.037 --> 02:26.756
It's getting beyond a joke.
You can never find owt in here.

02:26.757 --> 02:27.557
It's not that bad.

02:27.558 --> 02:29.676
Punters ask for the nurses outfit

02:29.677 --> 02:33.636
then spend five minutes watching
a girl on all fours rooting around,

02:33.637 --> 02:35.676
chucking plastic cocks
over her shoulder.

02:35.677 --> 02:37.517
Do you think they're paying for that?

02:43.197 --> 02:48.397
I mean, look, when was
the last time someone asked for
the Baby Spice experience?

02:52.317 --> 02:54.357
Is this real?

02:56.197 --> 02:58.557
You did know this was here?

03:04.997 --> 03:06.796
Hello?

03:06.797 --> 03:09.316
Slow down, yeah?

03:09.317 --> 03:11.636
What?

03:11.637 --> 03:14.636
All right. Yeah, yeah, just stay
there. Yeah, I'm coming down.

03:14.637 --> 03:16.476
Let me guess,

03:16.477 --> 03:19.236
another pissed off hubby's about
to go all Marathon Man on you?

03:19.237 --> 03:20.837
I am assuming that's a woman, yeah?

03:20.838 --> 03:23.036
Look Gloria, I've got
to go, all right.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.517
Dominic!

03:28.277 --> 03:29.757
Fuck's sake.

03:33.237 --> 03:35.876
You. Home. Now.

03:35.877 --> 03:36.716
What?

03:36.717 --> 03:39.356
There's a pile of dishes
in that sink so tall

03:39.357 --> 03:42.156
Brian fucking Blessed's
halfway up it.

03:42.157 --> 03:46.076
Aye, and that's why we did the rota.
In fact, it was Shane last night.

03:46.077 --> 03:47.757
Don't be bringing me
into this, thank you.

03:47.758 --> 03:50.476
It was you three nights ago.

03:50.477 --> 03:54.036
Which is why Billy didn't
do them the next night

03:54.037 --> 03:55.795
and Shane didn't do them last night.

03:55.796 --> 03:57.157
So when is it that you do them?

03:58.797 --> 04:01.076
When the rest of you are dead.

04:01.077 --> 04:05.436
And since there's enough
germs in that sink to fell
a herd of elephants,

04:05.437 --> 04:07.957
that won't be very long. Sort it!

04:11.437 --> 04:14.196
Hoo-hoo! You know what
they say, don't you?

04:14.197 --> 04:15.955
Hands that do
dishes and all that.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.077
Your face could do with
a little bit of softening.

04:18.077 --> 04:21.716
If what I hear through my wall every
night is anything to go by, Shane,

04:21.716 --> 04:23.477
you're the one with calluses.

04:24.997 --> 04:28.756
They've even got a live-in house
maid. She's nice. Brazilian.

04:28.757 --> 04:29.717
Is she now...? Should I be jealous?

04:29.718 --> 04:32.996
People like that... It's like
they can have whatever they want,

04:32.997 --> 04:34.916
when they want. Don't matter what.

04:34.917 --> 04:38.677
I can imagine. Here, can you do
us a favour before you go back?

04:41.597 --> 04:46.316
Don't worry. It's hers. She's been
investing it in kinky boots.

04:46.317 --> 04:48.437
And when I say invest,
I mean stuffing it in 'em.

04:48.438 --> 04:49.477
Why?

04:50.477 --> 04:52.876
Because she doesn't trust the banks.

04:52.877 --> 04:54.956
Tell him why, Lillian.

04:54.957 --> 04:57.436
They killed Diana.

04:57.437 --> 04:59.196
There you go.

04:59.197 --> 05:01.956
Anyway, I've talked
some sense into her.

05:01.957 --> 05:06.036
Stick that in our account and I'll
take her down tomorrow to open one.

05:06.037 --> 05:09.157
Eh, how do you know
she's got a Brazilian?

05:36.677 --> 05:38.797
All in.

05:47.157 --> 05:47.877
He's bluffing!

05:47.878 --> 05:50.276
Am I, though?

05:50.277 --> 05:51.197
Definitely.

05:51.198 --> 05:53.476
Yeah, it's not up to you, is it?

05:53.477 --> 05:56.677
It's between me
and Billy boy here.

06:00.437 --> 06:04.437
Bluffing, not bluffing...

06:08.637 --> 06:10.477
Fold.

06:15.437 --> 06:16.796
He's got fuck all!

06:16.797 --> 06:19.316
Fuck's sake, Billy! Are you
numb in the head or something?

06:19.317 --> 06:20.237
Stupid idiot!

06:20.238 --> 06:22.277
Told you he was bluffing.

06:49.917 --> 06:53.156
Oh, hey! Mein Fuhrer says
you've to sort that lot out.

06:53.157 --> 06:54.076
Me?!

06:54.077 --> 06:57.276
Shhhh! Don't wake her up,
she'll go mental.

06:57.277 --> 06:58.437
Yeah, she says it's your turn.

06:58.438 --> 07:00.236
Is it?

07:00.237 --> 07:02.797
Yep. Just reporting the facts, mate.

07:11.677 --> 07:14.436
Oh, you're back? Well,
I hope she was worth it,

07:14.437 --> 07:17.796
cos I nearly slipped a disc
carting them bags home on me tod.

07:17.797 --> 07:18.635
Gloria, can I have a word, please?

07:18.636 --> 07:20.397
Kind of in the middle
of something here.

07:21.517 --> 07:24.036
Right. Well, er,
we've got a house guest.

07:24.037 --> 07:25.237
It'll only be for a couple of days.

07:25.238 --> 07:27.957
House guest? If you've brought
back your latest piece of...

07:35.957 --> 07:37.716
Hazel.

07:37.717 --> 07:38.877
Gloria.

07:41.517 --> 07:43.197
I was adopted.

07:45.477 --> 07:50.076
Born a year ahead of Dominic.
When he arrived, kept him,

07:50.077 --> 07:53.236
sent me out to adoption.

07:53.237 --> 07:58.277
Come on, Mum, you can have my room.

08:01.277 --> 08:03.156
That was your mother?

08:03.157 --> 08:05.197
Birth mother.

08:12.077 --> 08:13.555
What do you think you're doing?

08:13.556 --> 08:14.797
The washing up?

08:14.798 --> 08:17.156
That's Ruby's job. Leave it alone!

08:17.157 --> 08:19.037
She said that you'd
asked me to do it.

08:19.038 --> 08:20.557
She was lying.

08:22.477 --> 08:23.437
Was she?

08:23.438 --> 08:26.317
How the fuck do you dress
yourself in the morning?

08:28.997 --> 08:32.477
So, am I doing this or not?

09:10.237 --> 09:11.556
What the fuck?!

09:11.557 --> 09:13.877
Gloria, I know, I know
it's not ideal, all right?

09:13.878 --> 09:17.076
There's nothing else I could do.
Her husband passed away last week.

09:17.077 --> 09:19.676
Her stepkids, they're not big
fans from what I can gather.

09:19.677 --> 09:22.796
Had someone changing locks even
as the funeral was taking place.

09:22.797 --> 09:26.556
If I'd have known
that's who you were bringing home,
I'd have done the same thing!

09:26.557 --> 09:28.756
All right... Hi, Mam.

09:28.757 --> 09:31.717
Sit yourself down. I was just
going to do a nice coffee.

09:33.597 --> 09:36.196
Don't be silly, sweetheart,
leave it to me.

09:36.197 --> 09:39.596
Least I can do after you let me stay.

09:39.597 --> 09:42.677
Actually, Mam, it's Gloria
you need to thank.

09:44.677 --> 09:46.836
Oh...

09:46.837 --> 09:48.517
I did wonder.

09:59.397 --> 10:00.637
Well?

10:02.557 --> 10:03.876
Well what, Frank?

10:03.877 --> 10:06.236
Do you need a lesson
in cultural gender roles

10:06.237 --> 10:08.556
in Western society or something?

10:08.557 --> 10:11.716
Tradition dictates that whilst the
man of the house goes out to work,

10:11.717 --> 10:13.916
the woman prepares his dinner.

10:13.917 --> 10:16.956
I'm not your woman, Frank!
Anyway, you work in a burger joint!

10:16.957 --> 10:19.396
I'm not going to eat that shit!

10:19.397 --> 10:21.517
You should see what we do to it.

10:23.477 --> 10:25.716
Shut the door,
you pillock, it's freezing!

10:25.717 --> 10:27.436
I've done something.

10:27.437 --> 10:28.317
Done what?

10:28.318 --> 10:30.756
The money... I've spent it!

10:30.757 --> 10:33.637
You've spent it?!
Three and a half grand?!

10:34.757 --> 10:37.876
I've bought... something.

10:37.877 --> 10:40.957
Fuck's sake, Marty,
you're scaring me! Bought what?!

10:43.984 --> 10:45.144
Hello.

10:52.827 --> 10:55.087
Loads of them were,
by this gang of men telling them

10:55.184 --> 10:58.302
they were getting a new life.
"Land of opportunity."

10:58.303 --> 11:01.262
Only, when they get here,
the jobs they were promised

11:01.263 --> 11:02.822
and the homes... nothing.

11:02.823 --> 11:04.582
A crate load of immigrants wash up

11:04.583 --> 11:07.742
and the council aren't chucking
fully-furnished semis at them?

11:07.743 --> 11:09.342
Fuck me, they must be slipping!

11:09.343 --> 11:12.302
Next thing she knows,
she's being moved around,

11:12.303 --> 11:15.702
bought and sold by rich families,
working for no money.

11:15.703 --> 11:17.742
She's a domestic slave!

11:17.743 --> 11:20.622
So you thought, "Hey,
we could do with one of them!"

11:20.623 --> 11:24.302
You can't just buy a person, Marty!

11:24.303 --> 11:26.502
You are aware of the irony,
of course?

11:26.503 --> 11:28.822
That's not why I did it!

11:28.823 --> 11:29.583
Then why did you?

11:29.584 --> 11:32.662
Because I had the chance
to save someone, rescue them.

11:32.663 --> 11:34.181
How often does that happen
round here?

11:34.182 --> 11:35.423
It wasn't your money.

11:35.424 --> 11:37.782
I wasn't thinking about
whose money it was.

11:37.783 --> 11:39.982
It was an impulse buy!

11:39.983 --> 11:41.782
She's not a fucking Twix!

11:41.783 --> 11:43.743
You're going to have to return her,

11:43.744 --> 11:46.742
first thing in the morning,
get the money back.

11:46.743 --> 11:48.663
Yeah, you kept the receipt, right?

11:49.863 --> 11:52.583
I've got most of the bits.
Where's your bin, please?

12:10.063 --> 12:13.822
Now, I've heard the boys
have took you for a bit of a ride.

12:13.823 --> 12:15.542
I don't know why I play with them.

12:15.543 --> 12:17.782
I mean,
it's not like I'm thick or owt.

12:17.783 --> 12:21.062
It's more like... I can't read
people, you know what I mean?

12:21.063 --> 12:23.622
Everyone always walks all over me.
I'm sick of it!

12:23.623 --> 12:25.983
You need to boost your self-esteem,
and that's all.

12:25.984 --> 12:29.263
See?
I don't even know what that means.

12:30.503 --> 12:31.782
Take this.

12:31.783 --> 12:33.622
Last two tracks.

12:33.623 --> 12:36.142
It's self-hypnosis.

12:36.143 --> 12:37.302
Hypnosis?

12:37.303 --> 12:40.862
What, like, pretend
you're a chicken and shit like that?

12:40.863 --> 12:43.142
It's subliminal learning.

12:43.143 --> 12:45.702
It makes you
more confident around people,

12:45.703 --> 12:49.063
helps you to understand 'em, read
their body language and all that.

12:52.903 --> 12:55.502
'You already know
everything you need

12:55.503 --> 12:58.742
'to be master of your relations
with the people around you.

12:58.743 --> 13:02.342
'You have the tools.
The signals are there.

13:02.343 --> 13:05.542
'All you have to do
is learn how to read them.'

13:05.543 --> 13:06.823
You're a hairdresser, then?

13:06.824 --> 13:08.982
What gave it away?

13:08.983 --> 13:12.062
You should let her do yours
while you're here.

13:12.063 --> 13:13.663
Oh, no. I don't think so.

13:15.463 --> 13:18.022
Funny seeing all this stuff
lying around, though.

13:18.023 --> 13:21.382
Reminds me of your Grandma's place,
Dominic, remember?

13:21.383 --> 13:24.702
Yeah. Never thought of it
like that before.

13:24.703 --> 13:27.422
Your mother? She was a hairdresser?

13:27.423 --> 13:28.822
Yes.

13:28.823 --> 13:32.262
I've always had a knack.
Maybe that's where I got it from.

13:32.263 --> 13:33.822
What was she like?

13:33.823 --> 13:35.862
She was horrible.

13:35.863 --> 13:38.942
She was, mind, Glores.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.263
I used to hide behind the sofa
whenever she came round.

13:41.264 --> 13:44.583
You've got her eyes.

13:57.263 --> 13:58.142
No!

13:58.143 --> 14:01.062
Come on, she's here now!

14:01.063 --> 14:04.062
At least she can have
a crack at the bathroom!

14:04.063 --> 14:05.823
Think, some of them skid marks have
been there since Lip was here.

14:05.824 --> 14:07.622
She's not working!

14:07.623 --> 14:09.582
You're not working!

14:09.583 --> 14:10.863
But I like working.

14:10.864 --> 14:13.382
A woman after me own heart!

14:13.383 --> 14:18.422
See, these welfare types, they don't
get people like you and me.

14:18.423 --> 14:20.782
What else should I do, then?

14:20.783 --> 14:22.982
Anything you want!

14:22.983 --> 14:24.502
Why don't you...

14:24.503 --> 14:26.823
I don't know... sit down?

14:28.343 --> 14:29.902
Here?

14:29.903 --> 14:31.942
You don't have to ask my permission.

14:31.943 --> 14:34.863
You can sit wherever you want
to sit. It's your choice.

14:38.063 --> 14:39.263
Not that one!

14:40.983 --> 14:43.742
Yeah, laugh it up!
It's your room she's stopping in.

14:43.743 --> 14:45.862
Oh, it's the gift
that keeps on giving!

14:45.863 --> 14:47.582
You're kipping with Aidan!

14:47.583 --> 14:49.623
First thing tomorrow.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.542
Gloria!

14:57.543 --> 14:58.743
What you doing, what's this?

14:58.744 --> 15:01.062
Look, I don't want an argument, OK?

15:01.063 --> 15:03.182
She obviously needs you right now.

15:03.183 --> 15:05.102
But I just...

15:05.103 --> 15:06.343
I can't be around her.

15:06.344 --> 15:08.862
So I'm going to be the good sister.

15:08.863 --> 15:10.623
You need a couple of days
to sort her out.

15:10.624 --> 15:12.702
You've got it.
But I just can't be here.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.501
Look, Gloria, I know it's hard,
all right?

15:14.502 --> 15:16.103
But it's hard for her as well, yeah?

15:16.104 --> 15:17.702
You think about it. Seeing you.

15:17.703 --> 15:19.702
Y'know, seeing what she's lost.

15:19.703 --> 15:21.382
She didn't lose me, Dominic!

15:21.383 --> 15:24.062
She gave me away.

15:24.063 --> 15:26.422
She gave me away

15:26.423 --> 15:29.263
and kept... you.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.463
All right.

15:33.743 --> 15:35.902
I know what you feel.

15:35.903 --> 15:38.543
But trust me...

15:39.543 --> 15:41.382
there was always regret.

15:41.383 --> 15:43.622
What?

15:43.623 --> 15:47.623
Well, she doesn't discuss you,
does she? Or what happened, but...

15:50.183 --> 15:52.503
there was regret.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.183
Just stay, all right?

15:59.423 --> 16:01.343
I think this can be good.

16:06.903 --> 16:08.463
For all of us.

16:35.183 --> 16:37.782
'All day, every day,

16:37.783 --> 16:39.822
'people say one thing
and mean another.

16:39.823 --> 16:42.262
'The true meaning,
the hidden meaning,

16:42.263 --> 16:45.262
'is revealed by how they say it.

16:45.263 --> 16:47.822
'There are over fifty muscles
in the human face

16:47.823 --> 16:50.182
'and each one has secrets to reveal.

16:50.183 --> 16:54.062
'Learn these secrets,
and you can be wise.'

16:54.063 --> 16:56.823
I'm just getting in
the shower to frig myself off.

16:58.383 --> 17:00.462
Yep.

17:00.463 --> 17:01.943
Wait! What did you say, then?

17:03.543 --> 17:06.262
Watch the baby
while I get in the shower.

17:14.383 --> 17:17.262
Wake up! She's gone!

17:17.262 --> 17:18.262
Who's gone?

17:18.262 --> 17:19.383
Who'd you think?

17:19.384 --> 17:20.902
Human traffic Barbie!

17:20.903 --> 17:24.742
I'm going to have to go through the
whole house, see what she's taken!

17:24.742 --> 17:26.143
Aparecida wouldn't do that!

17:26.144 --> 17:29.542
The complete stranger who talked
you into parting with three grand?

17:29.543 --> 17:30.823
Oh, no, I'm probably
worrying about nothing!

17:30.824 --> 17:32.462
It wasn't her that...

17:32.463 --> 17:34.262
Just get out there and find her!

17:34.263 --> 17:37.742
Before we end up in slave labour
trying to pay it back!

17:37.743 --> 17:38.782
Kelly! Kelly!

17:38.783 --> 17:41.022
Not working today, Frank?

17:41.023 --> 17:44.542
Oh, no. On strike. Solidarity.

17:44.543 --> 17:47.702
Union of fast food employees
out in support of,

17:47.703 --> 17:50.062
I dunno... teachers, nurses,
one of that lot.

17:50.063 --> 17:52.182
I don't fucking know.

17:52.183 --> 17:53.463
Y'all right, Billy?

17:53.464 --> 17:55.342
How's that baby of yours?

17:55.343 --> 17:58.262
'You should
be sterilised, you gimp!'

17:58.263 --> 17:59.662
Fuck you!

17:59.663 --> 18:02.543
Ooh! You ain't seen me!

18:07.103 --> 18:10.103
Where is she?!

18:13.983 --> 18:16.742
I told you to stop!

18:16.743 --> 18:18.582
You don't work here!

18:18.583 --> 18:19.742
I do!

18:19.743 --> 18:20.822
Aparecida!

18:20.823 --> 18:23.102
Oh, thank God! Do you know her?

18:23.103 --> 18:25.503
Of course he knows me!
He's my master.

18:27.183 --> 18:30.542
You what?! Look, if this is
some kind of kinky sex thing...

18:30.543 --> 18:32.542
I'm not her... I'm not your master!

18:32.543 --> 18:37.662
I'm not her master!
Fuckin-fried-rat-scrotes!

18:37.663 --> 18:38.023
Come on!

18:38.024 --> 18:40.102
It's my cloth!

18:40.103 --> 18:40.543
What?

18:40.544 --> 18:42.303
I brought the cloth!

18:45.703 --> 18:48.423
I'll let Frank know
he needs to come in, then...

18:54.183 --> 18:56.822
Why does nobody want me
to do my work?

18:56.823 --> 18:58.542
What did you buy me for?

18:58.543 --> 19:00.662
I didn't buy you!

19:00.663 --> 19:03.102
Well, I mean, I did, but...

19:03.103 --> 19:05.102
it doesn't matter.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.662
I'm sorry, Aparecida.

19:07.663 --> 19:10.102
You see, it's Kelly.

19:10.103 --> 19:11.742
Kelly?

19:11.743 --> 19:13.342
It's hard.

19:13.343 --> 19:15.583
It's very hard.

19:16.823 --> 19:20.182
I'm going to have to ask you to...

19:20.183 --> 19:22.302
What are you doing?!

19:22.303 --> 19:23.342
It's OK.

19:23.343 --> 19:24.902
No! Stop it! What are you doing?

19:24.903 --> 19:28.742
I meant I was going to have to ask
you to come back with me to...

19:28.743 --> 19:31.382
Does he? The man at the house...

19:31.383 --> 19:33.263
Suck me cock!

19:34.463 --> 19:36.263
Oh, not you!

19:38.623 --> 19:40.662
Tickle me balls!

19:40.663 --> 19:42.343
No! Leave them alone!

19:44.023 --> 19:46.702
You shouldn't be worrying
about that, not now.

19:46.703 --> 19:48.103
There's more important things.

19:48.104 --> 19:51.742
It was the proudest day
of my life, your ordination.

19:51.743 --> 19:53.543
Yeah, well, it's just a break,
that's all.

19:53.544 --> 19:55.182
You promise?

19:55.183 --> 19:57.023
Have I ever told you a fib?

20:03.183 --> 20:04.462
You hungry?

20:04.463 --> 20:06.183
I don't think I even had breakfast.

20:06.184 --> 20:08.262
Well, we can't have that, can we?

20:08.263 --> 20:10.462
No, you know what?

20:10.463 --> 20:11.902
Why don't we go out?

20:11.903 --> 20:14.543
Grab some pub grub?

20:16.263 --> 20:17.663
My treat?

20:19.263 --> 20:20.343
Yeah, OK.

20:22.903 --> 20:24.382
I can't take her back!

20:24.383 --> 20:26.023
Not if that's
what she's put through!

20:26.024 --> 20:28.262
I'm sorry, I really am.

20:28.263 --> 20:30.022
I'll find a way to pay you back.

20:30.023 --> 20:31.023
I knew you couldn't trust them
banks.

20:31.024 --> 20:32.542
What?

20:32.543 --> 20:33.583
Excuse me?

20:35.463 --> 20:36.383
The money wasn't yours?

20:36.384 --> 20:38.942
Well, no. Not technically.

20:38.943 --> 20:40.462
Then you bought me.

20:40.463 --> 20:42.583
Yes, I suppose I have.

20:44.583 --> 20:46.822
Wait, Aparecida!

20:46.823 --> 20:48.102
Abracadabra?

20:48.103 --> 20:49.902
That's a bit of a mouthful, that.

20:49.903 --> 20:51.303
Do you mind if I call you Brenda?

20:51.304 --> 20:53.182
No, of course not.

20:53.183 --> 20:54.463
Come on, Brenda.

20:54.464 --> 20:56.543
I'll show you the kitchen.

21:10.680 --> 21:13.539
Ow! What's up with you?

21:13.606 --> 21:16.265
What's up with me?
What's up with you,

21:16.332 --> 21:20.371
sitting round the house all day
doing fuck all? Get up!

21:20.372 --> 21:25.251
Four fucking days!
No more excuses! Clean it, now!

21:25.252 --> 21:25.892
I can't.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.051
Why not?

21:27.052 --> 21:30.571
I'm... I've got
things on my mind? OK?

21:30.572 --> 21:32.771
What things?

21:32.772 --> 21:34.892
I found a lump.

21:38.772 --> 21:41.891
It's... It's probably nothing.

21:41.892 --> 21:45.091
You're going to have to
get it checked out, love.

21:45.092 --> 21:47.091
Yeah, I will. I am.

21:47.092 --> 21:49.692
I've got an appointment.
This evening.

21:58.772 --> 22:01.131
Careful, will you?

22:01.132 --> 22:04.252
'You blind as well
as retarded? Knobhead.'

22:07.092 --> 22:09.611
I don't know what
you expect me to do.

22:09.612 --> 22:13.171
If you ask me, this has just
got us right out of the shit.

22:13.172 --> 22:14.652
She's living in a brothel!

22:14.653 --> 22:17.131
Yes. And your girlfriend
works in one, remember?

22:17.132 --> 22:18.531
No, that's different.

22:18.532 --> 22:21.411
So it's all right for me but not
your Portuguese princess? That it?

22:21.412 --> 22:26.051
She never had a choice!
She didn't then and she doesn't now!

22:26.052 --> 22:27.371
I can't just give up.

22:27.372 --> 22:29.291
Marty, it's Lillian.

22:29.292 --> 22:33.491
She may be silly as arseholes,
but when it comes to taking care

22:33.492 --> 22:36.132
of waifs and strays
she's in a league of her own.

22:37.332 --> 22:39.251
Trust me.

22:39.252 --> 22:42.932
The one place this girl
will NOT be exploited, is here.

22:50.732 --> 22:52.691
Y'all right, luvs?

22:52.692 --> 22:54.452
Now go and unblock that toilet.

22:57.532 --> 23:00.411
Know what you're saying,
more of a tit man meself, like.

23:00.412 --> 23:03.092
'Sooner have
a fat length of cock any day.'

23:23.572 --> 23:25.051
All right, calm down.

23:25.052 --> 23:28.371
Look if you're still smarting
over that poker loss,

23:28.372 --> 23:31.452
I'm sure we can give you a chance
to win it back this afternoon.

23:32.932 --> 23:34.772
You know what? You're on!

23:42.772 --> 23:44.891
So, I mean,

23:44.892 --> 23:49.931
I guess I haven't said,
but... I'm sorry.

23:49.932 --> 23:52.852
About your husband.

23:54.092 --> 23:55.771
Thank you.

23:55.772 --> 23:59.372
So you know, you're fine to stay
as long as you need...

24:01.532 --> 24:03.092
Mum.

24:04.572 --> 24:08.851
And y'know we can help you.
We could go to the council,

24:08.852 --> 24:11.291
or talk to someone about housing...

24:11.292 --> 24:12.931
D'you think I'm destitute?

24:12.932 --> 24:14.931
But Dom said
that your stepkids, they...

24:14.932 --> 24:16.451
They got the house, yeah.

24:16.452 --> 24:19.571
But I still got a nice lump sum,
thank you very much, he knows that.

24:19.572 --> 24:23.252
Just need it to clear,
then we'll both be gone.

24:24.812 --> 24:25.811
Both?

24:25.812 --> 24:28.931
Well, it's hardly healthy for him
is it? Living here. With...

24:28.932 --> 24:30.451
With you.

24:30.452 --> 24:32.852
No, I'll get him back on track,
always have done,

24:32.853 --> 24:34.412
no matter who leads him astray.

24:39.692 --> 24:41.652
Good luck with that, then.

24:57.772 --> 25:01.452
You must admit.
She does do a good cuppa.

25:04.212 --> 25:05.691
We'll take her back.

25:05.692 --> 25:07.571
Sorry, I can't spare her.

25:07.572 --> 25:08.691
I'll pay you.

25:08.692 --> 25:11.092
I don't believe this.
Now you want to rent her back?

25:11.093 --> 25:12.492
With what exactly?

25:13.692 --> 25:15.931
I could do some of the work for her.

25:15.932 --> 25:19.212
Whatever you've got her doing,
I'll take her place.

25:21.012 --> 25:23.331
Brenda!

25:23.332 --> 25:24.371
Madam?

25:24.372 --> 25:26.491
Madam! That's good, isn't it?

25:26.492 --> 25:29.651
Have you got that list
of jobs I gave you?

25:29.652 --> 25:30.931
Ta.

25:30.932 --> 25:32.732
Let me see this.

25:37.452 --> 25:38.852
OK, you know what?

25:40.332 --> 25:41.852
You knock yourself out.

25:48.772 --> 25:53.771
Oh. That's it.
Oh, go on, get right in there.

25:53.772 --> 25:58.011
Oh, oh, oh!

25:58.012 --> 26:01.212
Oh yes, yeah.

26:03.052 --> 26:07.252
Oh, oh, oh...

26:14.012 --> 26:16.211
There's not enough
soap in the world!

26:16.212 --> 26:18.211
Is there any bleach?

26:18.212 --> 26:21.771
You're funny.
You didn't have to do this.

26:21.772 --> 26:26.571
But I did. Because I chose to.

26:26.572 --> 26:30.571
It was my choice, that's
the difference between us.

26:30.572 --> 26:33.331
When did you last choose
anything for yourself?

26:33.332 --> 26:36.771
What would I choose?
I have everything I want.

26:36.772 --> 26:37.852
You've got nothing.

26:37.853 --> 26:40.411
I have a place to live. Food to eat.

26:40.412 --> 26:41.931
What else is there?

26:41.932 --> 26:43.851
Everything!

26:43.852 --> 26:46.411
Nights out, parties, PARTIES!

26:46.412 --> 26:50.011
Making mistakes,
being spontaneous and stupid,

26:50.012 --> 26:52.411
getting drunk and
dancing on table tops.

26:52.412 --> 26:55.131
Just getting out your face.

26:55.132 --> 26:57.491
Anything, as long as you
do it because you want

26:57.492 --> 26:59.211
and not cos you're ordered to.

26:59.212 --> 27:00.852
That doesn't sound
a good way to live.

27:00.853 --> 27:05.211
You've never tried it!
You believe all this is normal

27:05.212 --> 27:08.491
because you've been forced
into thinking that way.

27:08.492 --> 27:12.571
Nobody tells me what to believe,
I just believe what I do.

27:12.572 --> 27:16.132
The only person trying to
force me to be different is you.

27:17.332 --> 27:18.851
You don't want to be free?

27:18.852 --> 27:20.931
Do you?

27:20.932 --> 27:23.931
You live with Frank. In his house.

27:23.932 --> 27:27.211
Kelly, she works here,
men give her money and...

27:27.212 --> 27:28.771
That's different!

27:28.772 --> 27:30.051
How?

27:30.052 --> 27:31.411
She can stop.

27:31.412 --> 27:33.772
Why doesn't she?

27:34.852 --> 27:36.132
I don't know.

27:37.492 --> 27:38.972
She doesn't want to.

27:40.412 --> 27:43.051
It's not the same!
Why can't you see that?

27:43.052 --> 27:45.971
For a start, no-one
makes her dress like that,

27:45.972 --> 27:47.812
and answer to the name of "Brenda."

27:48.852 --> 27:52.411
OK, maybe some people do.

27:52.412 --> 27:55.772
But she still chooses her own life.

27:56.852 --> 27:59.612
Then why can't you
let me choose mine?

28:01.852 --> 28:03.132
Right, need her back.

28:03.133 --> 28:06.932
These bum-beads aren't going
to un-knot themselves. Come on.

28:14.132 --> 28:15.812
Glores?

28:22.852 --> 28:25.331
Where is she?

28:25.332 --> 28:26.851
I asked her to go to the shop.

28:26.852 --> 28:28.851
To buy you some sweeties?

28:28.852 --> 28:32.491
No. Because you weren't there
when I came out, so I...

28:32.492 --> 28:36.131
You thought that maybe she'd told
me? That she's not exactly homeless,

28:36.132 --> 28:38.612
and that you two have talked
about moving away together?

28:38.613 --> 28:40.252
Jesus, Dominic.

28:41.572 --> 28:45.611
What you said! "Her regret?"

28:45.612 --> 28:48.772
I sat there reaching out to her...

28:50.772 --> 28:53.851
and you made the whole thing up?

28:53.852 --> 28:55.932
What was the point?

28:56.972 --> 28:58.812
So you wouldn't...

29:00.132 --> 29:01.692
leave me with her.

29:03.052 --> 29:04.131
What?

29:04.132 --> 29:05.771
I can't do it, Glores.

29:05.772 --> 29:08.331
I never thought I'd have to
once she'd re-married,

29:08.332 --> 29:09.692
but now it's just me, isn't it?

29:09.693 --> 29:11.411
Or who she thinks I am.

29:11.412 --> 29:13.051
Just me and her.

29:13.052 --> 29:15.131
Someone who dotes on you?

29:15.132 --> 29:16.852
Someone who'll give you
everything without question?

29:16.853 --> 29:19.571
Until the role shifts.
They always do. Then what, eh?

29:19.572 --> 29:21.851
She'll get older.
She'll need looking after,

29:21.852 --> 29:23.532
so she'll expect me to come along...

29:23.533 --> 29:26.571
You are not seriously
telling me...? All this?

29:26.572 --> 29:30.291
You want me to bond with
a woman who rejected me

29:30.292 --> 29:33.771
because you have flashes
of adult nappies and plastic sheets?

29:33.772 --> 29:37.331
Christ, Glores, what
d'you expect me to say, eh?

29:37.332 --> 29:39.411
I can't be responsible for someone!

29:39.412 --> 29:41.531
I can barely be
responsible for myself!

29:41.532 --> 29:45.252
I just want to stay here, with you.

30:17.572 --> 30:19.411
Fuck!

30:19.412 --> 30:22.491
What can I say, lads?
You've all got too many tells.

30:22.492 --> 30:25.491
'How'd a waster like you
pull that off? What do you know?'

30:25.492 --> 30:27.971
'Still a shit dad
to my little sister.'

30:27.972 --> 30:31.131
'Cheating, slap-headed,
mother-porking shitwit.'

30:31.132 --> 30:32.332
I told you, I'll get a taxi.

30:32.333 --> 30:34.411
Credit where it's due, I suppose.

30:34.412 --> 30:35.971
Don't be stupid, love.

30:35.972 --> 30:38.051
Fuck off! I beat youse all, yeah?
Fuck off!

30:38.052 --> 30:40.331
Fuck's that about?

30:40.332 --> 30:42.131
Sore winner, apparently.

30:42.132 --> 30:44.931
Shane, I need you to drive Ruby.

30:44.932 --> 30:48.532
Oh. Right. Course.

30:49.852 --> 30:52.171
You told him?!

30:52.172 --> 30:54.372
Like I said,
we're all here for you love.

30:55.412 --> 30:56.412
Which one is it?

30:56.413 --> 30:58.532
Oh, my God.

31:04.812 --> 31:06.771
Hazel, look...

31:06.772 --> 31:09.812
Don't. I don't want to hear it.
You've changed him.

31:11.132 --> 31:12.652
This is all your fault.

31:34.753 --> 31:38.192
You thought you were going to get
away with that, did you? My fault?

31:38.193 --> 31:40.033
He never talked like that
before he met you.

31:40.034 --> 31:43.032
No. He was such a good
little boy, wasn't he?

31:43.033 --> 31:45.231
I mean, that's what you always
told him, isn't it?

31:45.232 --> 31:46.513
The chosen one.

31:46.514 --> 31:48.192
The one Mummy kept.

31:48.193 --> 31:51.032
He still walks round
like that, you know?

31:51.033 --> 31:53.952
People take it at face value.

31:53.953 --> 31:56.872
But he can't have
any meaningful relationships.

31:56.873 --> 32:00.112
Can't settle down, can't open up.

32:00.113 --> 32:02.592
I don't blame him.

32:02.593 --> 32:05.552
I had to look after my mother
in her old age. He saw that.

32:05.553 --> 32:07.033
Saw the way she treated me.

32:07.034 --> 32:09.552
Even now, you'll find
an excuse for him, won't you?

32:09.553 --> 32:11.473
So will you.

32:13.113 --> 32:15.793
Something in common, then.

32:20.513 --> 32:22.713
Why was it him?

32:23.953 --> 32:25.313
And not me?

32:29.673 --> 32:31.273
I didn't love you.

32:34.873 --> 32:37.632
I'm sorry. I know that's not
the answer you wanted.

32:37.633 --> 32:38.993
But it's the truth.

32:40.313 --> 32:43.832
I held you in my arms
and that bond you're meant to have?

32:43.833 --> 32:45.672
That maternal instinct?

32:45.673 --> 32:48.153
It never came.

32:49.913 --> 32:51.872
I wanted it to, waited for it,

32:51.873 --> 32:53.192
cradled you to my chest,

32:53.193 --> 32:55.753
willing myself to feel something,
anything.

32:58.233 --> 32:59.833
But, no.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.993
I think maybe it was the eyes.

33:11.193 --> 33:13.033
You really do look a lot like her.

33:16.993 --> 33:19.433
I guess all mothers
leave their scars, don't they?

33:23.193 --> 33:24.792
Don't worry.

33:24.793 --> 33:27.392
I imagine he'll be round
for Sunday lunch before you know it.

33:27.393 --> 33:31.112
And you can just go on and pretend
none of this ever happened.

33:31.113 --> 33:33.553
Something else we have
in common, eh?

33:44.793 --> 33:46.792
I don't know what
I've done without her.

33:46.793 --> 33:49.192
Best three grand I've ever spent.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.992
Couldn't lend us
a couple of quid, could you?

33:51.993 --> 33:53.392
Jackson. This is...

33:53.393 --> 33:55.193
Brenda.

33:57.193 --> 33:59.193
Brenda is Lillian's slave.

34:00.593 --> 34:01.952
Sorry?

34:01.953 --> 34:04.393
Here, you two should
think of getting one!

34:08.233 --> 34:09.312
All right.

34:09.313 --> 34:13.032
Now even I'm starting to question
the moral implications of this.

34:13.033 --> 34:14.513
See, I know I'm not the smartest.

34:14.514 --> 34:17.032
I always thought that's
what people were telling me.

34:17.033 --> 34:19.752
But it was more like
they were thinking I was a failure.

34:19.753 --> 34:22.792
As a husband, as a father,

34:22.793 --> 34:24.391
and as a person.

34:24.393 --> 34:26.871
Maybe when you grow up,

34:26.873 --> 34:28.391
you'll feel the same.

34:28.393 --> 34:31.512
'That's bollocks, Dad.'

34:31.513 --> 34:32.871
What?

34:32.873 --> 34:36.232
'Doesn't matter what other people
think. It matters what you think.'

34:36.233 --> 34:38.792
But... but they laugh at me.

34:38.793 --> 34:43.032
'So, what? Folks can think
you're an arsehole or Einstein.

34:43.033 --> 34:45.233
'You can't control them,
and why would you want to?

34:45.234 --> 34:47.112
'Get us my juice, will you?'

34:47.112 --> 34:49.391
But the cards. I won...

34:49.393 --> 34:52.312
'It was luck. He underestimated you.

34:52.313 --> 34:54.391
'It's the way it goes.'

34:54.393 --> 34:55.513
But I can read people.

34:55.514 --> 34:59.392
'Oh, really? Like you're reading me
right now?'

34:59.393 --> 35:01.112
Yeah.

35:01.113 --> 35:04.512
'I'm a baby. I don't have tells
or body language.

35:04.513 --> 35:07.392
'Eat, sleep,
and be cute is where I'm at.

35:07.393 --> 35:11.152
'You're projecting
your thoughts onto me.

35:11.153 --> 35:13.112
'There's no magic. It's just you.

35:13.113 --> 35:16.432
'And for what it's worth, right now,

35:16.433 --> 35:19.433
'you're the best dad in the world.

35:24.593 --> 35:26.512
'And now, if you don't mind,

35:26.513 --> 35:29.113
'I've got a big skidder in my nappy
that needs sorting.'

35:36.873 --> 35:38.672
Oh, come on! Cheer up, mate.

35:38.673 --> 35:41.312
Listen, if you're still interested
in human trafficking,

35:41.313 --> 35:42.871
I've got one in a wheelchair
at home.

35:42.872 --> 35:44.793
Could do you a good deal on it.
Barely used.

35:44.794 --> 35:48.113
Marty, you did everything you could.

35:56.033 --> 35:57.513
Marty!

36:00.113 --> 36:01.593
Hello?

36:03.033 --> 36:04.433
Hello, hello?

36:06.513 --> 36:09.152
We live in a world...

36:09.153 --> 36:12.512
We... we live in a world

36:12.513 --> 36:15.672
where life is so cheap

36:15.673 --> 36:18.312
that actual people
can be bought and sold.

36:18.313 --> 36:20.153
People like this woman here.

36:23.433 --> 36:25.873
That's all right. I'm very happy.

36:27.513 --> 36:30.512
A woman who's brought
to this country.

36:30.513 --> 36:32.872
It's not exactly
"I have a dream," is it?

36:32.873 --> 36:34.752
But he's giving it a go. Come on.

36:34.753 --> 36:39.112
With the promise of a better life.

36:39.113 --> 36:42.792
It's fine. I have a very nice life.

36:42.793 --> 36:47.672
Only to be sold by person to person

36:47.673 --> 36:49.672
like a piece of furniture!

36:49.673 --> 36:52.153
He was the one that bought her!

36:53.233 --> 36:56.952
Lillian. Please, do what's right!

36:56.953 --> 36:59.793
Give this poor girl her freedom!

37:01.353 --> 37:03.712
But let her keep the outfit!

37:03.713 --> 37:06.673
No, no it's all right! Please!

37:13.673 --> 37:16.433
Fine, you're free.

37:17.873 --> 37:19.313
What?

37:25.353 --> 37:27.712
I can't believe you did that!

37:27.713 --> 37:29.233
Was it all right? Was it all right?

37:29.234 --> 37:30.592
You were amazing!

37:30.593 --> 37:34.073
Well, we'll have to sort out
a payment plan.

37:45.873 --> 37:47.792
I found one myself once, y'know.

37:47.793 --> 37:49.512
A lump.

37:49.513 --> 37:51.353
Not on me tit, mind you,
but on me bollock.

37:51.354 --> 37:53.512
Turned out it were
just a blocked sweat gland.

37:53.513 --> 37:54.873
They give it a quick squeeze,

37:54.874 --> 37:56.952
all this yellow shit
came flying out of it.

37:56.953 --> 37:58.792
You'll be fine, I'm telling you.

37:58.793 --> 38:00.512
That is very reassuring, Shane.

38:00.513 --> 38:02.273
Thank you.

38:04.513 --> 38:06.632
Which hospital is it, anyway?

38:06.633 --> 38:08.592
Huh?

38:08.593 --> 38:11.232
Oh, it's...

38:11.233 --> 38:13.152
Not got your appointment card?

38:13.153 --> 38:15.193
Yes. It's just, erm...

38:18.953 --> 38:20.952
Sure you don't want me
to come in with you?

38:20.953 --> 38:22.992
No, no, no. I'm fine.

38:22.993 --> 38:25.792
Just need to find that card.

38:25.793 --> 38:27.952
Not St Thatcher's, is it?

38:27.953 --> 38:31.593
Yes, that's the one,
St... Thatcher's...

38:57.033 --> 38:58.273
Brew?

39:01.873 --> 39:03.633
Please.

39:14.033 --> 39:15.513
Your nails?

39:17.513 --> 39:19.872
Your fucking nails?!

39:19.873 --> 39:21.912
It was stupid, OK?

39:21.913 --> 39:23.672
I don't know why I said it.

39:23.673 --> 39:25.433
But once I had,
I couldn't take it back.

39:25.434 --> 39:27.872
I told you about my bollock!

39:27.873 --> 39:29.633
I didn't ask you to!

39:31.713 --> 39:33.152
This is it for you now.

39:33.153 --> 39:35.552
Please, you can't tell Mimi.

39:35.553 --> 39:37.672
My mam will put up
with a lot of shit, right?

39:37.673 --> 39:39.872
But pretending you've got cancer...

39:39.873 --> 39:42.473
to get out of doing
the fucking washing up?!

39:43.513 --> 39:45.193
Fucking hell!

40:02.793 --> 40:04.152
What are you doing?

40:04.153 --> 40:06.553
I can make it worth your while.

40:08.673 --> 40:12.232
I know that you want me.

40:12.233 --> 40:15.393
If you keep my secret,
I can keep ours.

40:22.993 --> 40:24.473
No idea what you're doing.

40:31.153 --> 40:32.633
I don't fancy you.

40:33.913 --> 40:35.433
You're my cousin.

40:36.793 --> 40:41.273
Hmmm... doesn't feel that way
to me.

40:46.993 --> 40:48.552
What are you doing?

40:48.553 --> 40:50.232
Get the fuck out.

40:50.233 --> 40:51.833
Fuck off!

41:07.193 --> 41:09.592
Right, I think you've had enough.

41:09.593 --> 41:11.552
Don't tell me what to do!

41:11.553 --> 41:14.392
Nobody tells me what do anymore!

41:14.393 --> 41:16.472
I'm free!

41:16.473 --> 41:19.272
Down, now!

41:19.273 --> 41:20.873
Right, that's it! Out!

41:21.873 --> 41:23.233
Out!

41:34.833 --> 41:37.193
She never used to be like that
when I had her.

41:38.953 --> 41:41.272
Oh, for fuck's sake!

41:41.273 --> 41:43.473
Come on!

41:44.473 --> 41:46.552
Aparecida!

41:46.553 --> 41:48.232
A sweat gland?

41:48.233 --> 41:50.073
Yeah.

41:51.553 --> 41:54.113
Thank the Lord for that!

41:56.273 --> 41:59.312
So, does this mean you can do
the washing up now?

41:59.313 --> 42:01.113
She's just got over cancer!

42:05.993 --> 42:07.792
Any joy?

42:07.793 --> 42:09.033
I've looked everywhere.

42:19.473 --> 42:21.073
So...

42:22.473 --> 42:24.112
it's good though, innit?

42:24.113 --> 42:26.913
Because now
you've got your freedom back.

42:29.153 --> 42:32.512
Not physically, obviously.
But in principle.

42:32.513 --> 42:34.633
And they might not deport you!

42:35.953 --> 42:38.472
One day I will come back

42:38.473 --> 42:41.392
and give you your freedom.

42:41.393 --> 42:43.313
See how you like it.

42:51.273 --> 42:54.952
'I say altruism
doesn't benefit you,

42:54.953 --> 42:57.832
'but I suppose there's
the feeling you get

42:57.833 --> 43:00.713
'from knowing
you've done the right thing.

43:03.753 --> 43:05.392
'Sparing the life of the spider,

43:05.393 --> 43:08.193
'or giving a tramp some change.

43:11.393 --> 43:14.872
'Even if you can't afford
to take a piss at the station.

43:14.873 --> 43:16.113
'It feels good.

43:20.073 --> 43:23.673
'And that's a fair swap for a little
damp patch in your trousers.'

43:29.793 --> 43:32.792
'You should always try to do
the right thing.

43:32.793 --> 43:35.553
'That's what I believe, anyway.'

43:41.593 --> 43:43.192
Shit.

43:43.193 --> 43:46.633
'Cos, think of the alternative.

43:50.193 --> 43:54.592
'Think of that feeling you get,

43:54.593 --> 43:57.953
'when you know you've definitely
done the wrong thing.

44:07.033 --> 44:13.793
'That gnawing, sickening,
twisting in your stomach.'

44:33.313 --> 44:38.793
'The knowledge
you can never go back...

44:40.553 --> 44:41.873
'..and undo it.

44:46.673 --> 44:48.433
'Ever.'

44:55.953 --> 44:57.033
I took out a loan.

44:57.034 --> 44:59.392
♪1,200 nine weeks ago.
How much do you owe now♪

44:59.393 --> 45:01.352
Five grand.

45:01.353 --> 45:02.753
Are you trying for another one?

45:02.754 --> 45:07.392
I've been double bagging lately.
Eh, bit of luck, might be Gloria's.

45:07.393 --> 45:10.232
We have one day to get hold of
five grand. Try not worry, yeah?

45:10.233 --> 45:12.032
Think of the baby.

45:12.033 --> 45:13.391
Don't come back empty handed, eh?

45:13.392 --> 45:14.871
Is this for the meat raffle?

45:14.872 --> 45:17.153
That's supposed to be in portions
in the bottom of the freezer.

45:17.154 --> 45:19.753
Is it mine? I need to know
what you're going to do.

46:01.233 --> 46:03.752
Right, that's about it.

46:03.753 --> 46:05.472
Oh, apart from this last one.

46:05.473 --> 46:07.793
Can't read your writing.

46:09.593 --> 46:12.633
I think it says... Brazilian.
