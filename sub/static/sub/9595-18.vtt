You have no empathy,
bow.

17:17.604 --> 17:18.803
What?!

17:18.805 --> 17:20.238
Just like
you had no second thought

17:20.240 --> 17:22.373
About forcing me
to get a vasectomy.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.808
Which you didn't get!

17:23.810 --> 17:25.743
Oh! So now I'm a liar
because I lied?

17:25.745 --> 17:28.646
You know what --
it's moments like this

17:28.648 --> 17:30.114
That make me want
to roll the tape

17:30.116 --> 17:31.149
On my own
escape fantasy.

17:31.151 --> 17:31.816
Roll it.
Yep.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.317
Kids go off to college.

17:33.319 --> 17:34.719
I run off to burning man.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.454
[ snickers ]
yeah,
and I fall in love

17:36.456 --> 17:40.224
With a sexy egyptologist
who tames wild horses

17:40.226 --> 17:42.593
And [gasps]
he reads me poetry,

17:42.595 --> 17:45.430
And he doesn't
have to take forced naps

17:45.432 --> 17:47.799
Because he eats
too many hot dogs.

17:47.801 --> 17:51.369
I eat the right amount
of hot dogs.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.273
Hey.
What are you doing up?

17:55.275 --> 17:56.774
Can't sleep.
Oh.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.077
I was really excited
about the new baby.

17:59.079 --> 17:59.710
Ohhh.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.280
That's so sweet!

18:02.282 --> 18:03.748
But there<i> are</i> other ways

18:03.750 --> 18:06.751
To get a new little sibling
who idolizes me.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.619
[ chuckling ]
like what?

18:08.621 --> 18:11.089
Like, you know how dad
never changes the batteries

18:11.091 --> 18:12.290
In the smoke alarm?

18:12.292 --> 18:13.591
Yeah.
[ chuckles ]

18:13.593 --> 18:16.194
Well, what if one day,
I come home

18:16.196 --> 18:18.596
And the whole house
is on fire?

18:18.598 --> 18:22.266
I do everything I can
to save you guys, but...

18:22.268 --> 18:23.534
It's too late.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.802
I get put
in foster care,

18:24.804 --> 18:27.371
And even though it's hard
sharing a room

18:27.373 --> 18:29.640
With five little brothers,
I'm a star.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.876
The kid
with the leather jacket

18:31.878 --> 18:34.879
Who risked his life
to save his family...

18:34.881 --> 18:37.115
Who<i> all</i> died.

18:37.117 --> 18:40.418
So...You were able
to save your leather jacket,

18:40.420 --> 18:41.586
But we all died?

18:41.588 --> 18:46.157
Poor old guy -- fell asleep
while smoking a cigar.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.859
Okay.
Started the fire.

18:47.861 --> 18:49.393
Okay. Yeah.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.629
Um...
That's very vivid.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.631
[ clears throat ]
hear me out.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.834
If you want everyone
to think you're a hero,

18:56.836 --> 18:59.871
Why not...
Learn a magic trick,

18:59.873 --> 19:01.806
Teach yourself
to peel an orange in one piece?

19:01.808 --> 19:04.142
People love that,
junior.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.144
You know, just double down
on what you've got

19:06.146 --> 19:08.880
Instead of putting
all your hopes into a new baby

19:08.882 --> 19:11.349
Or a...
Tragic house fire.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.384
Thanks, mom.
Yeah.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.452
I'll sleep on it.

19:14.454 --> 19:17.355
Wha-- okay.
You can sleep on it.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.657
Just...No one dies.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.292
I'm gonna sleep on it.

19:21.294 --> 19:21.926
Uh --

19:26.932 --> 19:29.634
How come
everybody in our family

19:29.636 --> 19:32.170
Has some insane fantasy
about how to get out?

19:32.172 --> 19:34.505
Junior hit you with that
house-fire story, didn't he?

19:34.507 --> 19:35.673
Oh, my god.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.941
[ chuckles ] vivid, right?
Yeah.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.709
[ chuckles ] wow.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.845
But, honestly, dre,
we're not that much better.

19:40.847 --> 19:41.746
Huh?

19:41.748 --> 19:43.247
Why didn't you
talk to me?

19:44.683 --> 19:47.285
Because I was afraid
that you would be mad

19:47.287 --> 19:50.521
That I wasn't
locked into our plan --

19:50.523 --> 19:52.823
You know,
four kids, a vasectomy.

19:52.825 --> 19:55.259
You know, everybody out of
the house by the time we're 50.

19:55.261 --> 19:56.594
It's a good plan.

19:56.596 --> 20:00.398
You know exactly
what you want our future to be.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.799
That's not true.
I --

20:01.801 --> 20:04.702
I always thought
being a doctor was everything,

20:04.704 --> 20:05.803
And then I had kids.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.572
And...?

20:08.574 --> 20:09.907
And a beautiful house.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.776
That you bought
together with...?

20:11.778 --> 20:15.446
An<i> amazing</i> realtor.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.914
Okay, I'll stop.
Dre, you know,

20:16.916 --> 20:20.718
Sometimes when I miss a recital
or a soccer game,

20:20.720 --> 20:23.921
I think I'm really
missing out on the kids.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.257
And I think maybe it's time
for me to just cool it

20:26.259 --> 20:29.827
With this hard-core doctor stuff
and be part-time or teach

20:29.829 --> 20:31.963
So that I could
spend more time with them.

20:31.965 --> 20:33.297
Really?
Yeah.

20:33.299 --> 20:34.398
I never knew.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.367
So you're gonna stop
being a doctor?

20:36.369 --> 20:38.936
Hell no.
I love being a doctor.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.472
But, dre, come on.
Life is complicated.

20:41.474 --> 20:44.308
Babe, we've got to tell
each other things like that.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.277
We got into this
so young.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.813
Of course
things are gonna change.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.948
I wish someone had told us that
when we got married.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.784
Ohh. [ sighs ]
we could have used that advice
way more than those towels.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.853
Babe, we made a contract
with each other.

20:55.855 --> 21:00.524
And the only constant
in that contract is us.

21:00.526 --> 21:01.859
The kids aren't a part
of that constant?

21:01.861 --> 21:05.396
You say the word, I'll get
my sonicare and my speedos,

21:05.398 --> 21:06.931
