WEBVTT

00:00.008 --> 00:02.799
Life.
It's literally all we have.

00:02.824 --> 00:05.225
But is it any good?
I'm a reviewer.

00:05.250 --> 00:07.917
But I don't review food,
books, or movies.

00:07.942 --> 00:10.531
I review life itself.

00:11.766 --> 00:13.766
Aah!

00:15.270 --> 00:17.337
Aah!

00:24.593 --> 00:27.584
Hello, and welcome to another
episode of "Review,"

00:27.609 --> 00:30.428
television's only show,
as far as I'm concerned,

00:30.453 --> 00:32.330
and certainly the only
one anybody needs.

00:32.359 --> 00:34.850
A.J., I'm ready
for my next review.

00:34.875 --> 00:35.914
Okay.

00:36.141 --> 00:39.257
It's an e-mail
from Wally in Chicago, Illinois.

00:39.282 --> 00:40.955
- Chicago.
- He writes,

00:40.980 --> 00:42.624
"The first I heard of cryogenics

00:42.648 --> 00:46.061
was when Walt Disney had himself
put on ice after he died.

00:46.085 --> 00:47.762
But now I see it everywhere.

00:47.786 --> 00:50.686
Can you review
cryogenics?"

00:55.761 --> 00:58.231
Cryogenics, that's, uh...

01:00.356 --> 01:01.675
That's being frozen.

01:02.401 --> 01:05.013
If it was me, I wouldn't do it.

01:05.037 --> 01:06.548
Ah, yes.

01:06.572 --> 01:07.916
Well, it isn't you.

01:07.940 --> 01:09.551
And I do whatever
is asked of me,

01:09.575 --> 01:11.753
- no matter what that is.
- You really do.

01:11.777 --> 01:14.656
So, Wally, you'd like to know
what cryogenics is like.

01:17.683 --> 01:18.994
Let's find out.

01:19.018 --> 01:20.722
Oh, my God.

01:20.986 --> 01:22.530
Oh, boy.

01:22.555 --> 01:25.067
<i>My initial research
into cryogenic freezing</i>

01:25.090 --> 01:28.136
<i>revealed the alarming enormity
of this request.</i>

01:28.160 --> 01:31.640
Here's the problem.
Uh, it's not currently possible

01:31.664 --> 01:33.742
to thaw out a frozen person
and bring them back to life.

01:33.766 --> 01:35.543
And nobody knows
when it will be.

01:35.567 --> 01:36.978
They did it
for "Captain America."

01:37.002 --> 01:38.146
- Did they?
- Yeah.

01:38.170 --> 01:40.487
But he's a cartoon character.

01:40.906 --> 01:43.118
<i>How could this be?</i>
Oh, my God!

01:43.142 --> 01:45.186
<i>Was I really going
to be frozen to death</i>

01:45.210 --> 01:46.988
<i>and left like that
for centuries?</i>

01:47.012 --> 01:48.423
<i>That was inconceivable.</i>

01:48.447 --> 01:50.458
<i>But then again,
this show had brought me</i>

01:50.482 --> 01:52.260
<i>to the brink of death so often.</i>

01:52.284 --> 01:54.229
I will end you!

01:54.253 --> 01:56.765
I'm definitely gonna die.
Aah!

01:56.789 --> 01:58.099
Oh, God.
I'm gonna die!

01:58.123 --> 02:01.202
Aah!
Oh, my God!

02:05.364 --> 02:07.342
[Bleep]

02:07.366 --> 02:09.948
<i>Perhaps it was just
a matter of time before "Review"</i>

02:09.973 --> 02:13.013
<i>actually stopped my heart,
possibly forever.</i>

02:13.038 --> 02:14.783
- What's the matter now?
- Oh, boy.

02:14.807 --> 02:16.384
He agreed to be
cryogenically frozen.

02:16.408 --> 02:18.453
- Now he's having a whole thing.
- I don't even understand this.

02:18.477 --> 02:20.088
I mean, would anybody
even do this to me?

02:20.112 --> 02:21.456
Yeah.
They will.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.925
- Are you serious?
- I'll make an appointment.

02:23.949 --> 02:25.370
Jesus.

02:25.851 --> 02:27.495
<i>That night, as I struggled</i>

02:27.519 --> 02:29.397
<i>with the insanity
of this review,</i>

02:29.421 --> 02:32.734
<i>I considered that this show had
always miraculously spared me</i>

02:32.758 --> 02:34.602
<i>so that I could go
on living life</i>

02:34.626 --> 02:36.104
<i>in order to review it.</i>

02:36.128 --> 02:39.093
<i>And I prayed my show
would save me again.</i>

02:39.865 --> 02:41.776
<i>I wrote letters to my wife
and son,</i>

02:41.800 --> 02:44.234
<i>which I entrusted
to my intern for delivery.</i>

02:46.348 --> 02:48.228
Good-bye, Mr. MacNeil.

02:48.340 --> 02:50.051
I'll try to live
as long as I can

02:50.075 --> 02:51.886
so I can help you out
in the future.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.417
I would like that.

02:57.736 --> 03:01.829
I arrived for my cryogenics
appointment in a fearful daze.

03:01.854 --> 03:03.131
Hi, I'm Forrest MacNeil.

03:03.155 --> 03:06.390
And I'm here to be
cryogenically frozen.

03:08.483 --> 03:10.294
Yep.
You're all set.

03:10.319 --> 03:11.705
<i>Upon reviewing this footage,</i>

03:11.730 --> 03:14.109
<i>it became clear that I had
missed important clues</i>

03:14.133 --> 03:16.811
<i>as to what was really going
on at this facility.</i>

03:16.835 --> 03:19.013
- This way.
<i>- How I wish I had read that sign.</i>

03:19.037 --> 03:22.830
<i>No doubt, it would have done
much to alleviate my fear.</i>

03:23.242 --> 03:25.653
I've left instructions that,
when I am thawed out,

03:25.677 --> 03:27.222
the show will continue

03:27.246 --> 03:29.758
so that I can review
being frozen,

03:29.782 --> 03:32.298
to live again in the future.

03:33.051 --> 03:35.452
- I'm ready!
- Great.

03:42.269 --> 03:45.729
Farewell to the early
21st century life

03:46.098 --> 03:49.644
of Forrest MacNeil,
reviewer of life!

03:52.704 --> 03:54.549
<i>Asking my crew to wait aeons</i>

03:54.573 --> 03:56.518
<i>for my rebirth seemed unfair.</i>

03:56.542 --> 04:00.021
<i>So I had instructed them
to leave once my journey began.</i>

04:00.045 --> 04:02.457
<i>I am sorry to say that
the overwhelming terror</i>

04:02.481 --> 04:05.293
<i>of being enveloped
in below-freezing temperatures</i>

04:05.317 --> 04:07.962
<i>caused me to lose consciousness.</i>

04:09.839 --> 04:13.285
[Beeping]

04:13.659 --> 04:16.337
<i>Which may explain why I left
that chamber certain</i>

04:16.361 --> 04:19.107
<i>that I had been suspended
in ice for centuries.</i>

04:19.130 --> 04:21.276
<i>I was astounded to be alive.</i>

04:21.300 --> 04:23.077
Oh, my God.

04:24.403 --> 04:26.881
<i>Still foggy from
my time in the ice,</i>

04:26.905 --> 04:30.807
<i>I stumbled out into
the unknown word of tomorrow.</i>

04:33.312 --> 04:35.857
<i>My clothes, fashionable
when I bought them,</i>

04:35.881 --> 04:38.276
<i>now seemed totally out of place.</i>

04:38.750 --> 04:40.962
<i>What's worse, in my own time,</i>

04:40.986 --> 04:43.364
<i>I was highly proficient
with technology.</i>

04:43.388 --> 04:46.267
<i>But now, I feared
I would surely be lost.</i>

04:46.291 --> 04:47.702
How is that possible?

04:47.726 --> 04:49.404
Remind me to call Francois.

04:49.428 --> 04:50.839
<i> Okay.
I'll remind you.</i>

04:50.863 --> 04:53.608
And as I tuned into
the conversations around me,

04:53.632 --> 04:55.810
<i>though the words were
being spoken in English,</i>

04:55.834 --> 04:57.893
<i>I no longer recognized
my language.</i>

04:58.174 --> 04:59.981
It's basically
a meme aggregator.

05:00.005 --> 05:01.583
I read about it on
the TIL subreddit,

05:01.607 --> 05:02.917
a lot of uploads.

05:02.941 --> 05:05.720
<i>"How," I wondered, "Would I ever
find a way to function</i>

05:05.744 --> 05:07.729
<i>in this strange, new world?"</i>

05:08.380 --> 05:11.326
<i>And then, I was struck
by the horrible realization</i>

05:11.351 --> 05:13.635
<i>that the love of my life
and our darling son</i>

05:13.660 --> 05:16.497
<i>had lived out years
of their lives without me.</i>

05:16.722 --> 05:18.199
<i>Why had I abandoned them</i>

05:18.223 --> 05:20.168
<i>forever to review
this experience?</i>

05:20.432 --> 05:21.769
<i>What a tragic mistake.</i>

05:21.793 --> 05:23.860
<i>Perhaps they were still alive.</i>

05:23.885 --> 05:26.774
<i>Maybe I could find them
and be with them again.</i>

05:26.798 --> 05:28.000
Oh, my God.

05:28.025 --> 05:29.210
What?

05:29.601 --> 05:31.616
You look just like
someone I used to know.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.648
What are you...

05:33.672 --> 05:35.213
Mr. MacNeil,
what are you talking about?

05:35.463 --> 05:37.407
- Josh?
- Yeah.

05:37.509 --> 05:40.255
I just dropped off the letters
like you asked me to.

05:40.454 --> 05:42.050
How long have I been gone?

05:42.114 --> 05:45.059
Um, zero hours and 45 minutes.

05:45.549 --> 05:47.643
- I've just been gone for 45 minutes?
- Yeah.

05:49.105 --> 05:50.464
Are you serious?

05:50.489 --> 05:51.933
- Yeah.
<i>- This experience</i>

05:51.956 --> 05:54.101
<i>was clearly not what
I had thought it was.</i>

05:54.126 --> 05:56.037
That means Suzanne and Eric
are still alive, right?

05:56.061 --> 05:57.572
I just saw 'em, so probably.

05:57.596 --> 05:59.674
<i>And yet, my journey
through cryogenics</i>

05:59.698 --> 06:02.377
<i>had brought me to a new
and different place.</i>

06:02.402 --> 06:04.113
- Forrest, what is this?
- Forget it, never mind.

06:04.136 --> 06:05.446
That's nothing.
I didn't do it. Forget it.

06:05.471 --> 06:06.782
- You didn't do it?
- No, I didn't do it.

06:06.805 --> 06:09.915
- You refused a review?
- Well, uh, no.

06:09.940 --> 06:12.853
I went to this cryogenics place
in the strip mall.

06:12.878 --> 06:14.355
But I guess I was just
frozen for a few minutes.

06:14.379 --> 06:15.823
The cryo-freeze place?

06:15.848 --> 06:18.611
But my mom got a coupon
there for a skin treatment.

06:18.636 --> 06:20.231
You thought they were
gonna freeze you to death?

06:21.306 --> 06:23.217
- Yeah.
- And you were gonna do it

06:23.241 --> 06:25.320
for some stupid [bleep] review?

06:25.344 --> 06:26.688
Yes.
I was, okay.

06:26.712 --> 06:28.089
- Good-bye, Forrest.
- No, no, no, no!

06:28.113 --> 06:29.624
This is important!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:29.648 --> 06:31.259
I realized something
when I thought that you

06:31.283 --> 06:33.161
and Eric had been dead
for a thousand years.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.495
- Forrest...
- I... No, I realized

06:34.519 --> 06:35.997
that you're right, okay?

06:36.021 --> 06:37.532
There is nothing that I could

06:37.556 --> 06:38.967
possibly have shared
with the world

06:38.991 --> 06:41.336
about being frozen that
would have been worth

06:41.360 --> 06:43.471
never seeing the two
of you again, nothing.

06:43.496 --> 06:46.540
And it feels so great
to realize that, okay?

06:48.282 --> 06:49.565
You know, Forrest,

06:49.968 --> 06:52.619
I want you to remember
this feeling.

06:53.151 --> 06:57.265
And I want you to think
really carefully about Th...

06:57.476 --> 06:59.187
About this.

06:59.969 --> 07:01.694
You understand?

07:01.719 --> 07:03.063
Yeah.

07:03.095 --> 07:05.474
- Take these.
- I will take it, yes.

07:09.554 --> 07:13.368
Whole-body cryotherapy
is a new fitness

07:13.392 --> 07:15.169
and/or beauty trend,

07:15.193 --> 07:18.010
which, by the way,
has no proven benefits.

07:18.077 --> 07:20.073
It doesn't involve
being suspended in time

07:20.098 --> 07:21.709
for hundreds of years.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.885
I give cryogenics two stars.

07:31.476 --> 07:33.588
Darnell from
Sandy Springs, Georgia.

07:33.613 --> 07:34.656
Beautiful.

07:34.681 --> 07:36.709
He writes, "My uncle
was struck by lightning,

07:36.734 --> 07:38.779
and he's never been able
to tell us what it was like

07:38.803 --> 07:41.148
because he doesn't
understand words anymore.

07:41.172 --> 07:44.397
What's it like to be
struck by lightning?"

07:46.677 --> 07:48.522
Oh, boy. Uh...

07:48.741 --> 07:50.290
Darnell, thank you
for trusting me

07:50.314 --> 07:52.025
with this very
important question.

07:52.049 --> 07:54.913
What is it like
to be struck by lightning?

07:55.853 --> 07:57.331
Forrest, what are you doing?

07:57.355 --> 07:59.066
<i>This was
a good question,</i>

07:59.090 --> 08:00.767
<i>especially in light of my
cryogenics experience.</i>

08:00.791 --> 08:02.603
Wow, okay.
<i>But that review lead</i>

08:02.627 --> 08:05.172
<i>to an encouraging conversation
with my ex-wife.</i>

08:05.196 --> 08:08.308
<i>Who knew what being struck
by lightning might bring?</i>

08:08.332 --> 08:10.110
There is a 90% chance

08:10.134 --> 08:12.746
that someone who is struck
by lightning will survive.

08:12.770 --> 08:15.882
But that is less than 100%.

08:15.906 --> 08:17.644
And so I have decided
to send letters

08:17.669 --> 08:19.384
to Suzanne and Eric

08:19.616 --> 08:20.941
just in case.

08:24.448 --> 08:27.256
"I will be frozen to death."
No, I won't.

08:28.085 --> 08:29.949
The rest applies.

08:30.454 --> 08:34.059
There is a 10% chance
that I won't see you again.

08:35.293 --> 08:37.726
I hope you feel that I've been
as good a boss...

08:39.563 --> 08:41.140
Whoa!

08:41.164 --> 08:43.744
<i>My staff and I traveled
to El Mirage, Arizona,</i>

08:43.768 --> 08:45.979
<i>the nearest town
with a storm watch in effect.</i>

08:46.003 --> 08:48.048
<i>We had a very
smart plan in place.</i>

08:48.072 --> 08:51.418
We've tied together
three telescoping flagpoles,

08:51.442 --> 08:53.420
giving us 75 feet of aluminum

08:53.621 --> 08:56.223
stretching way up
into the heavens.

08:56.247 --> 08:58.725
It's the highest object
around for a long ways,

08:58.749 --> 09:01.862
and I am tied to it
with copper wire.

09:01.886 --> 09:03.864
You only have about
a one-in-a-million chance

09:03.888 --> 09:05.198
of getting struck by lightning.

09:05.222 --> 09:08.435
But then again, that statistic
only applies to people

09:08.459 --> 09:11.004
who are not actively
trying to get struck

09:11.028 --> 09:13.328
by lightning, which I am!

09:13.864 --> 09:16.443
<i>20 minutes later,
I had had no luck.</i>

09:16.467 --> 09:18.471
- I think the worst part of it is over.
- Yeah.

09:18.496 --> 09:20.293
Hey, where was that storm
for tomorrow night?

09:20.318 --> 09:21.486
Uh, Houston.

09:21.511 --> 09:23.260
Houston.
Houston, Texas.

09:23.285 --> 09:24.963
Well, we may be racking up

09:24.987 --> 09:26.964
the frequent flyer miles
on this one, but...

09:28.324 --> 09:29.501
Oh, my God!
Mr. MacNeil!

09:29.525 --> 09:30.936
Hold on!

09:30.960 --> 09:32.904
<i>Amazingly, I had done it.</i>

09:32.928 --> 09:34.706
<i>As my body convulsed with pain,</i>

09:34.730 --> 09:37.576
<i>it was clear that
I was being killed by lightning.</i>

09:37.600 --> 09:39.110
Oh, my God!

09:40.503 --> 09:41.980
[Bleep]
Ow! Ow!

09:42.004 --> 09:43.814
Oh, my God!

09:44.096 --> 09:45.331
[Bleep]

09:46.942 --> 09:49.502
<i>In what I believed were
my final moments on Earth,</i>

09:49.527 --> 09:52.591
<i>I thought of my family
and of my skeleton,</i>

09:52.615 --> 09:54.584
<i>which may have been on fire.</i>

09:56.485 --> 09:58.296
Darnell, your uncle's experience

09:58.320 --> 10:00.966
of being struck
by lightning was terrible.

10:00.990 --> 10:04.147
While I regret the loss
of my sense of smell,

10:04.360 --> 10:06.238
which I really hope
is temporary,

10:06.262 --> 10:08.707
and I'm very saddened
by the many broken bones

10:08.731 --> 10:11.810
suffered by my intern, Josh,
that demonstration

10:11.834 --> 10:14.827
of nature's power
was very inspiring to me.

10:14.852 --> 10:16.330
So all in all,

10:16.355 --> 10:18.166
I give being struck by lightning

10:18.191 --> 10:20.525
two and a half stars.

10:23.429 --> 10:25.418
All right, A.J.
What's next, please?

10:25.810 --> 10:29.389
Sometimes it's really tough
to press this button, Forrest.

10:29.468 --> 10:32.447
Well, I believe in you, A.J.
You can do it.

10:32.472 --> 10:35.317
The next request
comes to us from Suzanne

10:35.342 --> 10:37.018
in Los Angeles, California.

10:37.042 --> 10:38.720
Really?
Hey, whoa, wait a minute.

10:38.744 --> 10:40.522
I'm recording this right
after you wrote me

10:40.546 --> 10:42.591
that you were trying
to get struck by lightning.

10:42.616 --> 10:45.460
If you're seeing this,
it means you're still alive

10:45.484 --> 10:47.095
and there's still time for me

10:47.119 --> 10:49.741
to do what I feel
like I have to do.

10:50.089 --> 10:52.206
I have a review request.

10:52.992 --> 10:55.003
What's it like to spend
the rest of your life

10:55.027 --> 10:57.216
not reviewing anything?

10:57.430 --> 11:00.388
Just do your job
and see what that's like.

11:00.413 --> 11:02.631
And be a part
of your son's life.

11:03.002 --> 11:05.541
But, Forrest,
I want to be clear.

11:06.005 --> 11:08.350
If you do not do this request,

11:08.374 --> 11:11.631
you will never see me
or Eric again.

11:12.334 --> 11:14.122
Okay, you're welcome.

11:15.285 --> 11:16.891
Oh, my God.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.327
_

11:22.463 --> 11:24.405
Forrest, I can't believe it.

11:24.666 --> 11:26.553
I can't believe that either.

11:27.972 --> 11:31.553
I guess this is
the end of "Review."

11:33.507 --> 11:35.987
I think it may be
the end of "Review."

11:37.244 --> 11:39.790
Look what she did for me there.
That's...

11:39.814 --> 11:41.450
That's love.

11:42.311 --> 11:43.627
That is love.

11:43.651 --> 11:45.083
I'm gonna miss you.

11:47.021 --> 11:48.257
I'm gonna miss you.

11:49.757 --> 11:51.268
Well, ah...

11:52.100 --> 11:53.896
a very interesting
turn of events,

11:53.921 --> 11:55.226
I would have to say.

11:56.742 --> 11:58.686
Uh, the woman I married

11:58.711 --> 12:01.557
has just stepped
in to extricate me from,

12:01.582 --> 12:04.772
um, my rather extreme job.

12:09.873 --> 12:12.513
What is it like to spend
the rest of my life

12:12.538 --> 12:14.783
not reviewing anything?

12:15.064 --> 12:18.616
I'm gonna walk out that door
and have

12:19.412 --> 12:20.928
that experience.

12:23.522 --> 12:25.133
Uh, but before I do,

12:25.157 --> 12:26.968
I think I need to have
a quick conversation

12:26.992 --> 12:28.369
with our producer, Grant.

12:28.393 --> 12:30.271
I don't know. Forrest, I don't
think you need to do that.

12:30.295 --> 12:32.006
No, of course, I need to.
You know, I mean,

12:32.031 --> 12:35.037
he obviously gives me so much
great advice in general.

12:35.061 --> 12:36.990
I don't want to just go
out there and do this

12:37.015 --> 12:38.147
without talking to Grant.

12:38.172 --> 12:39.537
Grant, are you here, Grant?

12:39.562 --> 12:40.780
- Yes.
- Oh, hi.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.545
I don't know if you saw that.

12:44.570 --> 12:46.709
- But, uh...
- Remarkable, huh?

12:46.734 --> 12:47.945
Yeah.

12:48.015 --> 12:50.788
This is how it ends?
I love it.

12:51.072 --> 12:52.917
- You do?
- I do.

12:52.942 --> 12:55.654
I mean, you could veto it.
The veto booth is right there.

12:55.756 --> 12:57.555
But why would you?

12:58.215 --> 13:00.748
Forrest, you can go
back to your family.

13:04.331 --> 13:06.476
I mean, part of me will be sad

13:06.500 --> 13:09.936
because your reviews have been
phenomenal this season.

13:10.103 --> 13:12.081
Yes.
Yeah.

13:12.105 --> 13:14.358
When they told me
I would never walk again,

13:14.850 --> 13:16.895
I said, "You know what?
That's nothing,

13:17.248 --> 13:20.556
because I saw a man run
into the arms of death,

13:20.580 --> 13:24.093
and he was spared
by a miracle to do great

13:24.117 --> 13:26.436
and crucial work
in the world."

13:28.070 --> 13:28.998
Am I curious about

13:29.022 --> 13:31.034
what reviews Forrest MacNeil
would do in the future

13:31.058 --> 13:32.602
if you veto this?
Of course.

13:32.626 --> 13:33.970
Would you eventually do a review

13:33.994 --> 13:36.406
that would blow all your other
work out of the water?

13:36.430 --> 13:37.659
Of course.

13:37.794 --> 13:40.570
But seriously, go, please.

13:40.834 --> 13:42.312
Spend a couple of good years

13:42.336 --> 13:45.303
hanging out with your boy
before he goes to college...

13:45.596 --> 13:47.649
and then doesn't want to
see you anymore.

13:48.842 --> 13:50.483
- Right.
- Yeah.

13:50.523 --> 13:53.455
Or you could make him
proud of you

13:53.480 --> 13:55.152
for the rest of his life.

13:56.022 --> 13:58.278
I guess that's the choice.

14:01.621 --> 14:03.202
It's a hard one.

14:03.924 --> 14:05.780
Do you think I have
work left to do?

14:06.489 --> 14:08.522
Only you can
answer that, Forrest.

14:14.558 --> 14:15.695
Okay.

14:18.081 --> 14:19.641
Okay.

14:21.875 --> 14:25.088
A.J., I will now
veto this review!

14:25.112 --> 14:26.389
- No!
- Yes.

14:26.413 --> 14:29.425
Forrest, wait!
Grant, initiate the protocol.

14:29.449 --> 14:32.195
Are you certain you wish
to veto this review?

14:32.219 --> 14:33.563
Yes, I am.

14:33.587 --> 14:35.865
Are you certain you wish
to veto this review?

14:35.889 --> 14:37.014
Yes, I am.

14:37.039 --> 14:40.475
Are you certain you wish
to veto this review?

14:41.350 --> 14:42.271
Yes, I am.

14:42.296 --> 14:44.035
You may veto this review.

14:44.060 --> 14:45.273
Thank you, Grant.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.915
Spending the rest of your life
not reviewing anything...

14:52.472 --> 14:53.819
Vetoed!

14:57.415 --> 15:00.995
What a horrible decision
to have to make, good Lord.

15:01.081 --> 15:02.525
But it had to be done

15:02.549 --> 15:05.709
because I was put on
the Earth to do this.

15:05.815 --> 15:08.241
So, Suzanne, if you're watching,

15:08.522 --> 15:10.348
first of all, thank you.

15:10.763 --> 15:14.102
Uh, but listen, not all the
reviews are life-threatening.

15:14.127 --> 15:16.039
So everything's gonna be fine.

15:16.063 --> 15:19.709
Okay, A.J.,
what's my next review?

15:19.842 --> 15:21.295
I don't feel like it.

15:21.468 --> 15:23.446
You don't feel like it?
What do you mean you don't...

15:23.470 --> 15:25.114
We've got time
for another review.

15:25.138 --> 15:26.749
You forget that
I have done your job.

15:26.773 --> 15:28.751
I know how to use
your information pad.

15:28.775 --> 15:29.952
Look at this.
See that?

15:29.976 --> 15:32.221
Ah.
I can do... Okay.

15:32.245 --> 15:36.405
It's a webcam
from Phil in Melbourne.

15:36.430 --> 15:38.716
Hey, Forrest, how come
you've never reviewed

15:38.741 --> 15:40.896
being hit by a car?

15:41.626 --> 15:43.103
It's weird.

15:43.291 --> 15:45.974
Anyway, what's it
like to be pranked?

15:46.259 --> 15:48.404
Oh, see that?
Look at that.

15:48.686 --> 15:49.939
You were so afraid.

15:49.964 --> 15:50.975
That's a great one.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.308
It looks like April Fools' has
come a bit early this year.

15:53.333 --> 15:54.748
What do you think of that?

15:54.847 --> 15:56.057
Nothin'?

15:56.151 --> 15:58.785
Ah, well, here
I go to get pranked.

16:01.918 --> 16:03.991
This should be a fun one, right?

16:05.726 --> 16:07.303
<i> At first,
being pranked appeared</i>

16:07.327 --> 16:09.230
<i>to be just the assignment
I needed after</i>

16:09.255 --> 16:11.216
<i>the emotionally exhausting experience</i>

16:11.241 --> 16:13.380
<i>of vetoing
my ex-wife's request.</i>

16:13.405 --> 16:16.371
<i>But then I realized that
since I can't prank myself,</i>

16:16.396 --> 16:18.829
<i>this had the potential
to be uniquely challenging.</i>

16:18.854 --> 16:20.663
- Hi.
- Hello, Grant.

16:22.944 --> 16:24.955
Well, I should talk
to you about something.

16:24.979 --> 16:27.258
This is very difficult
in light of recent events,

16:27.282 --> 16:28.926
but I'm just gonna
cut to the chase

16:28.950 --> 16:30.936
and tell you
what I just learned.

16:31.453 --> 16:32.717
What is it?

16:32.954 --> 16:35.971
"Review" has, uh, been canceled.

16:37.087 --> 16:38.651
What?

16:39.349 --> 16:42.728
Did you just tell me
that "Review" has been canceled?

16:42.964 --> 16:44.275
Afraid so.

16:44.299 --> 16:46.977
No. That can't be true.
No, Grant, Grant.

16:48.155 --> 16:49.045
No.

16:49.070 --> 16:50.214
I know.

16:50.238 --> 16:52.483
They can't do that.
Nobody can do that.

16:52.507 --> 16:54.585
You can't do...
You don't do that.

16:54.609 --> 16:56.153
You can't do that, Grant!

16:56.177 --> 16:57.421
Hey, listen to me.

16:57.445 --> 17:00.538
What you are saying
now cannot happen.

17:00.639 --> 17:02.960
[Bleep] no!
Are you [bleep] kidding me?

17:02.984 --> 17:04.829
- I wish I were.
- I just [bleep] vetoed

17:04.853 --> 17:06.530
that thing from Suzanne
trying to get me out of there

17:06.554 --> 17:08.531
because you [bleep] told me to!

17:08.556 --> 17:11.167
[Bleep] no!
Get back on the [bleep] phone,

17:11.192 --> 17:12.670
and you tell them, "No.

17:12.694 --> 17:16.231
If you do this, the host
will [bleep] kill himself.

17:16.256 --> 17:18.909
We're doing more of this.
Absolutely not."

17:18.933 --> 17:20.611
I'm in the middle
of a review right now.

17:20.635 --> 17:22.279
I mean, we're in the middle
of doing this.

17:22.303 --> 17:24.512
We're in
the middle of doing it.

17:28.309 --> 17:31.822
<i>Grant's prank was a true
masterpiece of the form.</i>

17:31.846 --> 17:33.526
Grant, that was...

17:34.916 --> 17:36.994
That was a little too good.

17:37.018 --> 17:39.697
<i>The most impressive thing
about it was that it took me,</i>

17:39.721 --> 17:41.565
<i>a man who was waiting
to be pranked,</i>

17:41.589 --> 17:43.200
<i>completely by surprise.</i>

17:43.224 --> 17:44.668
Okay.
I know that you're doing

17:44.692 --> 17:47.404
a segment
on being pranked right now.

17:47.429 --> 17:48.905
But this is actually real.

17:48.930 --> 17:51.308
Why would they cancel "Review"?
I feel like an idiot.

17:51.333 --> 17:54.128
Well, it's the ratings.
They're really bad.

17:54.153 --> 17:56.714
Haven't you noticed how few
questions we've been getting?

17:56.739 --> 17:58.282
You're still doing it?

17:58.307 --> 18:00.251
Your ex-wife
asked a question.

18:00.275 --> 18:01.886
That's how few submissions
we're getting.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.389
I want you to know that I did
not take this lying down.

18:05.414 --> 18:06.691
Okay.

18:06.715 --> 18:08.259
Even though they're
bumping me upstairs

18:08.283 --> 18:10.733
to be a vice-president
of the network,

18:10.758 --> 18:11.928
I fought for you.

18:11.953 --> 18:14.733
I guess people just didn't care
for the show as much as we did.

18:14.757 --> 18:16.000
You really thought
it through, too.

18:16.024 --> 18:17.635
My God.
Thank you.

18:17.659 --> 18:18.686
Okay.

18:24.389 --> 18:26.858
This is a very nice touch.
Oh, my God.

18:28.045 --> 18:30.547
<i>The best pranks
involve multiple people</i>

18:30.572 --> 18:32.951
<i>bolstering one another's
ridiculous deceptions.</i>

18:32.975 --> 18:34.252
- Hello.
- Hi.

18:34.276 --> 18:35.854
<i>And this was
a truly great prank.</i>

18:35.878 --> 18:37.322
Oh, boy.
We're really sorry.

18:37.346 --> 18:38.421
About what?

18:39.264 --> 18:40.841
About the show getting canceled.

18:40.865 --> 18:43.544
Ah, yes.
Poor "Review" getting canceled.

18:43.568 --> 18:45.952
What will become
of the two of you?

18:46.471 --> 18:48.949
Well, A.J. got a new show.
Ah.

18:48.973 --> 18:50.284
- It's a travel show.
- Oh.

18:50.308 --> 18:52.219
Yeah. So she's gonna
actually take us with her

18:52.243 --> 18:53.554
and take us around the world.

18:53.578 --> 18:55.823
And she's going to pay us.

18:56.261 --> 18:58.105
- Yes, got it.
- It's kind of amazing.

18:58.130 --> 18:59.631
Yes, that is.
That is.

18:59.656 --> 19:01.030
I don't want to go
around the world.

19:01.055 --> 19:02.569
I don't want to get paid.

19:02.952 --> 19:04.663
I just want to work
for Mr. MacNeil.

19:04.796 --> 19:05.897
It's...

19:05.922 --> 19:08.541
<i>Josh endured what must
have been excruciating pain</i>

19:08.566 --> 19:09.975
<i>for the purpose of this joke.</i>

19:10.000 --> 19:11.577
<i>And for that, I salute him.</i>

19:11.602 --> 19:13.013
- What are you doing?
- I think he's trying to hug you.

19:13.459 --> 19:15.216
As you would in the case

19:15.241 --> 19:17.491
of a cancellation
of the show, yes.

19:18.096 --> 19:19.880
I love you more than my dad.

19:19.905 --> 19:23.461
Okay, best male
intern in a drama.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.326
<i>My staff had impressed me
in innumerable ways.</i>

19:29.351 --> 19:30.995
<i>But their dedication
to helping me</i>

19:31.020 --> 19:33.999
<i>with my review of being pranked
was unprecedented...</i>

19:34.022 --> 19:36.100
Here we go.
<i>And totally wonderful.</i>

19:36.124 --> 19:38.536
Have you got a farewell speech
for me, Lucy?

19:39.341 --> 19:41.055
Um...

19:42.663 --> 19:43.641
Thank you.

19:43.665 --> 19:46.216
This is actually
the easiest job I've ever had.

19:46.241 --> 19:47.319
Is that right?

19:47.344 --> 19:49.756
Yeah. I've written three
erotic novels

19:49.781 --> 19:51.581
under the name
Beverly LaFontaine

19:51.606 --> 19:53.093
if you want to check 'em out.

19:53.708 --> 19:55.386
Thank you for
letting me know that.

19:55.410 --> 19:58.194
We'll have to find more
for you to do in the future.

19:58.814 --> 20:00.825
Oh, you're in denial.
Okay.

20:00.849 --> 20:02.686
This should make this
go smoother.

20:02.834 --> 20:05.262
I am not
a very sentimental person,

20:05.287 --> 20:06.444
but, um...

20:07.550 --> 20:09.699
I'm glad you got out
of this dumb show alive.

20:09.724 --> 20:11.693
Mmm, yes.

20:12.256 --> 20:13.718
She's really leaving.

20:15.530 --> 20:17.008
<i>Three days into this prank,</i>

20:17.032 --> 20:19.577
<i>I began to wonder just
how far this conspiracy</i>

20:19.601 --> 20:21.012
<i>of silliness extended.</i>

20:21.036 --> 20:24.115
<i>Had my ex-wife and son been
roped into the fun, as well?</i>

20:24.139 --> 20:25.583
<i>But there was no way of knowing,</i>

20:25.607 --> 20:27.351
<i>because when I stopped
by their house,</i>

20:27.375 --> 20:29.109
<i>no one was home.</i>

20:30.946 --> 20:33.791
<i>As the week came to a close,
this prank revealed itself</i>

20:33.815 --> 20:36.828
<i>to be fantastically elaborate.</i>

20:36.852 --> 20:38.460
Uh. Oh, God.

20:41.819 --> 20:44.491
This just goes on and on and on.

20:49.467 --> 20:52.677
"Now you can review
what it's like to be pranked.

20:52.701 --> 20:54.788
Love, Josh and Tina."

20:54.963 --> 20:57.238
That's a bit of a hat on a hat.

20:57.572 --> 20:59.550
<i>But Josh and Tina were right.</i>

20:59.574 --> 21:02.903
<i>I could certainly review
what it was like to be pranked.</i>

21:03.979 --> 21:06.357
And it keeps getting better
because look who's not here...

21:06.381 --> 21:08.960
A.J. Gibbs.
She's also playing along,

21:08.984 --> 21:11.429
off to do her
travel show, I guess.

21:11.453 --> 21:13.364
Ah, it is a total delight

21:13.388 --> 21:15.032
to see everyone in my world

21:15.056 --> 21:18.436
working together to improvise
a kind of a comic play.

21:18.460 --> 21:20.638
Though I did feel
a bit foolish at first,

21:20.662 --> 21:23.674
I mostly feel very fortunate
to be surrounded

21:23.698 --> 21:26.711
by people who care enough
about me and my work

21:26.735 --> 21:28.880
to go to such great lengths.

21:28.904 --> 21:31.883
Now, if I have one criticism,
it's that this prank

21:31.907 --> 21:33.784
was really not
all that believable,

21:33.808 --> 21:35.453
because what kind of a universe

21:35.477 --> 21:37.155
would be cruel enough
to allow "Review"

21:37.179 --> 21:40.758
to be canceled right
after I chose it over my family?

21:40.782 --> 21:42.293
Come on.

21:42.317 --> 21:43.594
But all in all,

21:43.618 --> 21:47.187
I give being pranked
five really fun stars.

21:49.499 --> 21:51.648
That's all the time
we have for "Review"

21:51.884 --> 21:53.095
See you next time.
