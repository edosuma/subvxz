01:26.854 --> 01:28.486
I'm tellin' ya, she
was checkin' me out.

01:28.488 --> 01:30.020
I don't
know where you get

01:30.022 --> 01:31.790
your delusions, laser brain.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.659
It's not a
delusion, it's a fact.

01:34.661 --> 01:37.261
She was checking out
the latest issue of Conan.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.496
Oh, and you're tellin'
me she wasn't looking

01:38.498 --> 01:40.599
right in the general
direction of my butt?

01:40.601 --> 01:44.772
Dude, you were kneeling
right next to the comic.

01:46.739 --> 01:48.606
Okay, maybe she was
looking for Conan,

01:48.608 --> 01:49.841
but she changed her mind

01:49.843 --> 01:51.876
when she saw an
actual male nearby.

01:51.878 --> 01:53.344
Dude, you're a
great guy, but...

01:53.346 --> 01:54.179
No.

01:54.181 --> 01:55.013
No, no, no.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.281
What?

01:56.283 --> 01:58.216
That whole you're a
great guy but thing,

01:58.218 --> 01:59.951
nothing good ever comes
after those words.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.486
Look, what I
was trying to say was...

02:01.488 --> 02:02.787
Like, you're a great guy,

02:02.789 --> 02:04.956
but I like my guys taller.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.123
You're a great guy,

02:06.125 --> 02:07.925
but I think we should
just be friends.

02:07.927 --> 02:09.461
You're a great guy,

02:09.463 --> 02:11.062
but I don't like you looking
through my window at night.

02:11.064 --> 02:11.899
Okay.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.866
Hey, there's Kevin.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.836
The one person we know with
a genuinely happy love life

02:17.838 --> 02:20.771
that's even remotely
reality-based.

02:22.975 --> 02:26.979
Apparently if your reality
is a Tim Burton film.

02:38.124 --> 02:40.859
Life is just a simmering
cauldron of misery,

02:40.861 --> 02:42.493
stirred by heartache,

02:42.495 --> 02:43.763
fueled by pain.

02:47.066 --> 02:48.432
Ah, don't hold it in, dude.

02:48.434 --> 02:49.835
Tell us how you really feel.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.836
What's wrong?

02:51.838 --> 02:53.771
Lemme ask you guys this.

02:53.773 --> 02:55.272
What is the worst possible thing

02:55.274 --> 02:57.475
that somebody can find
out about their girlfriend

02:57.477 --> 03:00.344
that can ruin any hopes
and dreams of the future

03:00.346 --> 03:04.148
and leave their lives
in a smoldering heap?

03:04.150 --> 03:05.884
She was your
secret twin sister

03:05.886 --> 03:07.551
who was separated
from you at birth

03:07.553 --> 03:08.954
when you were both
put into foster care

03:08.956 --> 03:12.525
to hide you from your
evil overlord father.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.326
Remember how
yesterday me and Ashley

03:15.328 --> 03:17.596
went to my cousin's wedding?

03:17.598 --> 03:20.397
Well I ran into my
Great-Aunt Irene.

03:20.399 --> 03:23.668
Turns out to be Ashley's
Great-Aunt Irene also.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.370
- You don't mean?
- Yeah.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.138
We're second cousins.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.976
I had no idea,
Ashley had no idea.

03:31.344 --> 03:34.579
And to think, I was gonna
ask her to marry me.

03:34.581 --> 03:36.114
So what, does that
make, like, holidays

03:36.116 --> 03:37.883
difficult or something?

03:37.885 --> 03:38.719
Really?

03:40.386 --> 03:44.289
Dude, we can't get married
if we're related like that.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.591
Our kids will end up
havin' 11 fingers,

03:46.593 --> 03:47.427
two heads,

03:48.295 --> 03:50.596
or even become a sports fan.

03:51.531 --> 03:53.497
We broke up last night.

03:53.499 --> 03:55.366
Shades of Luke and Leia.

03:55.368 --> 03:57.002
Dude, that sucks.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.537
This is like
when they found out

03:58.539 --> 04:02.542
that Boomer was a bad guy
in Battlestar Galactica.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.646
Well it's not like she
tried to shoot me or anything.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.316
Okay, bad analogy.

04:10.483 --> 04:11.582
Well, hey, listen,
uh, we're goin'

04:11.584 --> 04:12.516
to Spenser's later tonight.

04:12.518 --> 04:13.818
Why don't you come with?

04:13.820 --> 04:15.853
Spenser's, really?

04:15.855 --> 04:18.322
Nobody ever goes to his parties.

04:18.324 --> 04:19.523
Well yeah, but
he's got all those

04:19.524 --> 04:21.158
great Silver Age
comics we can read.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.928
And all the great Silver
Age toys we can play with.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.331
You guys are the best.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.533
We're like you're
Grey Council,

04:28.535 --> 04:31.302
the ruling body of the Minbari.

04:31.304 --> 04:32.771
Just 'cause he has
hair like a Centauri

04:32.773 --> 04:35.072
doesn't mean you can make
a Babylon 5 reference.

04:35.074 --> 04:37.776
I mean, we're more like his
Rebel Alliance or Jedi Order.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.478
Or we could be crew
mates on his ship.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.014
Yeah, leave it to a Trekkie
to make a nautical reference.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.182
You know I'm not
really a Trekkie.

04:45.184 --> 04:46.586
I'm a Brown Coat.

04:48.388 --> 04:49.553
Man, what are you
even doing here anyway?

04:49.555 --> 04:51.889
Shouldn't you be at work?

04:51.891 --> 04:55.393
I'm letting Todd
run things today.

04:55.395 --> 04:56.595
What?

04:56.597 --> 04:59.600
You put Todd in
charge of the store?

05:12.812 --> 05:15.613
Jackpot, here I come, payday.

05:15.615 --> 05:17.247
Here I come.

05:17.249 --> 05:20.317
Hey, uh, can I help
you with something?

05:20.319 --> 05:21.886
I got some comics for sale.

05:21.888 --> 05:23.822
Oh, okay, yeah, happy to help.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.189
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:25.191 --> 05:26.925
- Lemme do that.
- Ah, hey, buddy,

05:26.927 --> 05:29.360
I'm a professional at this.

05:29.362 --> 05:31.261
You can be a professional
at handling comics?

05:31.263 --> 05:32.631
Yeah, seriously.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.665
It's a niche field
in Museum Studies.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.768
Actually, a very niche field.

05:36.770 --> 05:40.038
I got my certificate from the
Art Institute of Pittsburgh.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.173
It's in the back if
you wanna see it.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.511
I can go get it if you want.

05:46.312 --> 05:48.646
Okay, I'll trust you.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.615
- Good.
- Good.

05:50.617 --> 05:54.285
- Remember, these are my babies.
- Got ya.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.220
All right.

05:55.222 --> 05:56.620
Your babies, I'll be careful.

05:56.622 --> 05:58.023
- All right?
- Feast your eyes.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.725
See what kind of treasure
you got for me here.

06:00.727 --> 06:03.360
Okay, Death of Superman?

06:03.362 --> 06:06.199
Yeah, mint
condition, number 75.

06:07.566 --> 06:08.565
Okay.

06:08.567 --> 06:11.201
Uh, Death of Superman.

06:11.203 --> 06:13.637
Death of, looks like all
these are Death of Superman.

06:13.639 --> 06:16.141
Well yeah, 50 of 'em!

06:16.143 --> 06:18.576
Camero, here I come.

06:18.578 --> 06:21.346
Slow down
a little bit, buddy.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.113
Um, you wouldn't happen
to have any Beanie Babies

06:23.115 --> 06:25.115
or vacuum-sealed
Cabbage Patch dolls

06:25.117 --> 06:27.351
to help sweeten
the deal, would ya?

06:27.353 --> 06:28.819
You know what, I might!

06:28.821 --> 06:30.288
- Would that really help?
- No, no, no.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.790
'Cause you know my sister
used to collect 'em...

06:31.792 --> 06:32.990
- I was just, just kidding.
- She even had the heads.

06:32.992 --> 06:35.026
Just kidding, back in 1991,

06:35.028 --> 06:37.295
way too many people
horded those things,

06:37.297 --> 06:40.566
way too much supply,
not enough demand.

06:41.802 --> 06:45.069
Well, no, no, no,
no, this is Superman!

06:45.071 --> 06:47.805
Not, not Bird-Man
or Aquaman, Super...

06:47.807 --> 06:51.108
Okay, Superman couldn't even
defeat his greatest enemy.

06:51.110 --> 06:52.310
All right?

06:52.312 --> 06:54.579
I'll give you 20 bucks
for the whole box.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.781
That's the best
you're gonna get.

06:57.783 --> 06:59.350
No, no.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.153
No.

07:00.987 --> 07:02.721
What a crock.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.322
- You know what?
- What?

07:04.324 --> 07:07.492
You run a real
cutthroat operation here.

07:07.494 --> 07:08.526
Yeah, I guess.

07:08.528 --> 07:09.360
Hey!

07:09.362 --> 07:10.196
What?

07:11.364 --> 07:14.264
What if I could get
you a girl to kiss?

07:15.669 --> 07:17.035
Yeah?

07:17.037 --> 07:18.737
- Yeah, little sweeten the deal?
- Nah, not so much.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.939
Uh, you're barkin' up
the wrong tree, buddy.

07:20.941 --> 07:21.775
Sorry.

07:24.410 --> 07:25.244
Fine.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.247
I'm gonna take these to
Mage's on the West Side.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.915
- Not our mortal enemy?
- Yeah, yeah.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.550
- Oh no, please don't!
- Yeah.

07:32.552 --> 07:33.718
Please don't, I tell ya what,

07:33.720 --> 07:36.086
I'll give you 21.09 for those.

07:36.088 --> 07:38.322
Just for that, I'm
takin' my Star Wars

07:38.324 --> 07:41.526
Episode One, Two, and
Three action figures

07:41.528 --> 07:42.694
- and sellin' 'em there.
- No, please don't!

07:42.696 --> 07:44.461
50 cents a piece.

07:44.463 --> 07:46.463
When I get my Camero,

07:46.465 --> 07:48.533
it's gonna look
like the Batmobile.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.300
Yeah, okay, keep dreamin'.

07:50.302 --> 07:51.870
Yeah, a clickety-clunk Camero

07:51.872 --> 07:53.704
from a buy-here-pay-here
lot maybe.

07:53.706 --> 07:54.538
You know what?

07:54.540 --> 07:55.473
Screw you!

07:55.475 --> 07:57.544
Oh whatever, douche bag.

07:58.778 --> 08:00.812
Have fun at Mage's.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.613
God, what a douche bag.

08:02.615 --> 08:05.382
No wonder I sleep on the job.

08:15.227 --> 08:16.728
Hey, Spence, great party.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.163
More than five people
actually showed up.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.004
Hey, guys.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.843
I just don't believe it.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.110
Well this is
sounding familiar.

08:33.111 --> 08:34.211
What's up?

08:34.212 --> 08:36.947
One day, one gorm day

08:36.948 --> 08:38.883
since me and Ashley broke up,

08:38.885 --> 08:40.851
and is she mourning like I am?

08:40.852 --> 08:41.885
Hell no.

08:41.886 --> 08:43.989
She's goin' out on dates.

08:45.091 --> 08:46.557
Well, some people
are different.

08:46.559 --> 08:49.360
Some people like to get
right back up on the horse.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.330
Not only that, she
decides to go out on a date

08:52.332 --> 08:54.932
with that Neanderthal
Chuck Hanaley.

08:54.934 --> 08:56.634
Chuck Hanley.

08:56.636 --> 08:57.568
Isn't he that guy that works

08:57.570 --> 08:58.836
over at Ted's Sporting Goods?

08:58.838 --> 09:01.038
One and the same.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.908
How does she go from a
well-mannered individual,

09:03.910 --> 09:05.275
intelligent,

09:05.277 --> 09:07.144
to somebody that
has to be reminded

09:07.146 --> 09:09.379
to breathe through their nose?

09:09.381 --> 09:11.816
Swear, if he got fresh
with her last night,

09:11.818 --> 09:13.017
I'm gonna walk into that...

09:13.019 --> 09:14.586
All right, hold
on, Captain Reynolds.

09:14.588 --> 09:17.254
Put your brown coat away,
and let's think here.

09:17.256 --> 09:19.456
If we go into Ted's
Sporting Goods half-cocked,

09:19.458 --> 09:20.725
somebody's gonna get hurt,

09:20.727 --> 09:22.192
and it's probably gonna be me.

09:22.194 --> 09:24.762
And I'm not gonna be
Wash this time, damn it.

09:24.764 --> 09:27.631
We have to plan our
moves carefully.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.767
What do you suggest?

09:29.769 --> 09:31.469
We could go over to her work

09:31.471 --> 09:34.105
and ask if Chuck's been
skulking around at all.

09:34.107 --> 09:37.041
Or you could talk to Ashley.

09:37.043 --> 09:38.809
What if Ashley's working?

09:38.811 --> 09:41.479
I don't want her to think
that I'm spyin' on her.

09:41.481 --> 09:43.047
Even though you are.

09:43.049 --> 09:47.051
But I don't
want it to look like I am.

09:47.053 --> 09:48.286
'Kay, tell ya what.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.053
I'll go in first, I'll
scope out the scene,

09:50.055 --> 09:50.989
and, if everything's clear,

09:50.991 --> 09:53.523
I'll ring you on your cell.

09:53.525 --> 09:55.726
You're a good friend.

09:55.728 --> 09:58.230
Okay, just wait for my call.

10:36.670 --> 10:37.902
Hey, Kev?

10:37.904 --> 10:39.673
Coast is clear, dude.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.440
Seriously?

10:42.442 --> 10:44.042
You're gonna call
me from outside

10:44.044 --> 10:46.778
when the shop's right next door.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.047
I said I'd call.

10:49.049 --> 10:49.882
Come on.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.160
Hey, PJ.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.262
Hey, Kevin, what's up?

11:04.264 --> 11:05.596
Not much.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.898
Oh, I know, you
wanna see Ashley.

11:07.900 --> 11:08.899
Hold on, she's in the back room.

11:08.901 --> 11:10.100
Let me go get here.

11:10.102 --> 11:13.272
No, no, no.

11:14.741 --> 11:18.244
And you didn't ask if
she was in the back.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.144
I didn't think of it.

11:21.146 --> 11:22.714
Dude, I swear
if you had brains,

11:22.716 --> 11:24.217
you'd be an idiot.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.819
Hey, Kev.

11:28.755 --> 11:29.655
Hey, Ash.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.259
So how have you been?

11:35.261 --> 11:37.097
Good, how 'bout you?

11:39.098 --> 11:41.231
Uh, you know, I still have that

11:41.233 --> 11:44.469
Hellblazer graphic novel
of yours at the house.

11:44.471 --> 11:49.240
I didn't know if you wanted
me to bring it here or?

11:49.242 --> 11:50.075
No.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.677
Constantine was always
more your thing than mine.

11:53.679 --> 11:55.113
You keep it.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.514
Are you sure.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.583
- Yeah.
- All right.

11:59.585 --> 12:01.219
I guess I'll see ya later.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.054
See ya.

12:31.150 --> 12:32.417
Todd?

12:32.419 --> 12:34.487
You must be Zod Killer?

12:37.223 --> 12:39.389
So, you gotta tell me this.

12:39.391 --> 12:41.958
Your screen name
on dbhookedup.com

12:41.960 --> 12:44.861
is Zod Killer but your
real name is Clark?

12:44.863 --> 12:46.532
Oh, you think I'm.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.735
Todd, there's been something
I've been meaning to tell you.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.072
I am really, no!

12:54.074 --> 12:56.773
I'm just a huge
Superman fan, man.

12:56.775 --> 12:57.908
Yeah, when I found
out that we actually

12:57.910 --> 12:59.744
had the same exact name.

12:59.746 --> 13:02.179
My full name is
Clark Kent Allan.

13:02.181 --> 13:03.480
Well, I was infatuated with him.

13:03.482 --> 13:04.648
I mean, seriously,

13:04.650 --> 13:07.319
I only read Superman
and DC Comics.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.024
Okay, yeah, that's great.

13:14.026 --> 13:15.993
Dude, I can't wait!

13:15.995 --> 13:17.163
Yay.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.996
Oh, Kevin, will you crawl out

13:19.998 --> 13:21.566
of your Ashley-sized hole

13:21.568 --> 13:23.433
long enough to see daylight?

13:23.435 --> 13:26.537
We've been waiting for
this for four years!

13:26.539 --> 13:28.405
I still can't believe it.

13:28.407 --> 13:29.639
Believe it.

13:29.641 --> 13:31.576
Hey, guys, what's up?

13:31.578 --> 13:32.478
Not much.

13:33.913 --> 13:35.513
Yeah, you can say that again.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.715
What's up with Darth
Vasidious over here?

13:37.717 --> 13:40.217
He's mad I won't go
see a movie with him.

13:40.219 --> 13:41.485
A movie?

13:41.487 --> 13:42.753
A movie?

13:42.755 --> 13:44.187
Try the movie

13:44.189 --> 13:45.389
of the century.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.225
Dude, century's only
like 13 years old.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.926
You're gonna have
to be more specific.

13:48.928 --> 13:52.395
It's the movie
adaptation of Hellblazer.

13:52.397 --> 13:54.065
The John Constantine comic?

13:54.067 --> 13:56.333
Didn't they already make one?

13:56.335 --> 14:00.037
Yeah, right, that Keanu
Reeves piece of bantha fodder.

14:00.039 --> 14:02.005
Like that even counts.

14:02.007 --> 14:05.109
Dude, is that, like, a demon?

14:05.111 --> 14:05.944
Bogus.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.749
This is an independent
film from Thailand,

14:11.751 --> 14:13.850
and they didn't get
permission from DC Comics,

14:13.852 --> 14:16.854
so they had to change all
the main characters' names.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.822
A small price to pay.

14:18.824 --> 14:22.960
Finally, a John Constantine
movie that's dark and gritty

14:22.962 --> 14:27.331
and doesn't star some
brain-dead Nic Cage wannabe.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.133
Dude, they changed the
main character's name

14:29.135 --> 14:30.370
to Ben Affleck.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.504
Like that matters.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.538
They could've changed his
name to Brittany Spears

14:34.540 --> 14:36.039
for all I care.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.475
It's just that we,
we've been waiting

14:37.477 --> 14:39.277
to see this for four years,

14:39.279 --> 14:40.477
and now Dave Depression here

14:40.479 --> 14:42.013
is wimping out on going with me.

14:42.015 --> 14:42.848
Look,

14:44.317 --> 14:46.116
Mark's gonna go see a movie,

14:46.118 --> 14:49.019
and I just got the biggest
shipment of the month.

14:49.021 --> 14:52.023
And then Ashley has
a life of her own,

14:52.025 --> 14:54.491
which is more than I
could say for myself.

14:54.493 --> 14:56.159
And I'm stuck here with nobody

14:56.161 --> 14:59.363
to help with the largest
shipment of the month.

14:59.365 --> 15:00.965
Excuse me.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.166
Did I hear you say you
have a new shipment

15:02.168 --> 15:03.400
coming in today?

15:03.402 --> 15:04.735
Yeah, are you
looking for something

15:04.737 --> 15:05.937
that we're out of, or?

15:05.939 --> 15:06.803
Well I was wondering,

15:06.805 --> 15:08.038
do you pull boxes first

15:08.040 --> 15:09.206
or do you catalog
your whole shipment

15:09.208 --> 15:10.640
before itemization?

15:10.642 --> 15:12.143
Do you have enough
boards and bags,

15:12.145 --> 15:15.111
or do those come in
a separate delivery?

15:15.113 --> 15:17.148
Uh, exactly what
are you asking?

15:17.150 --> 15:18.316
Well, I was just noticing

15:18.318 --> 15:20.283
that you can probably
use some help,

15:20.285 --> 15:22.620
and I have some
experience in comic shops.

15:22.622 --> 15:23.955
My name's Carley.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.188
Kevin.

15:25.190 --> 15:27.057
- Where'd you work?
- Comic Underground.

15:27.059 --> 15:28.058
Is that around here?

15:28.060 --> 15:29.493
Uh, no, I just
moved back home.

15:29.495 --> 15:31.361
I've been in Oberlin for
the past couple years.

15:31.363 --> 15:32.964
It's local to there.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.498
College girl, huh?

15:34.500 --> 15:35.865
I went to college once myself.

15:35.867 --> 15:38.269
I, it wasn't really
my thing, though, so.

15:38.271 --> 15:42.105
You worked at a college,
Mark, in the cafeteria.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.541
You quit when the
lady's volleyball team

15:43.543 --> 15:45.775
gave you a wedgie, remember?

15:45.777 --> 15:47.043
Are you lookin' for work?

15:47.045 --> 15:48.546
I am.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.480
I wasn't exactly coming
in here looking for that,

15:49.482 --> 15:51.148
but if opportunity knocks.

15:51.150 --> 15:52.283
Can, can you start today?

15:52.285 --> 15:53.451
I can start right now.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.985
Oh my gosh, good.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.921
Well, exactly why'd
you come in here?

15:56.923 --> 15:58.054
I was wondering if you had any

15:58.056 --> 15:59.356
Strangers in
Paradise collection.

15:59.358 --> 16:00.691
My roommate used to read that,

16:00.693 --> 16:02.659
and I haven't had a
chance to pick one up

16:02.661 --> 16:04.161
since I moved out.

16:04.163 --> 16:05.629
That's one of my
favorite series.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.897
- No way!
- Yeah!

16:06.899 --> 16:09.833
I, we're out of stock
of it here right now.

16:09.835 --> 16:11.101
But guess what?

16:11.103 --> 16:13.137
I have the complete
series at my house.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.071
I can let you borrow it

16:14.073 --> 16:15.139
until I talk to the suppliers

16:15.141 --> 16:16.240
and get some more in.

16:16.242 --> 16:17.975
Dude, that would be so cool.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.210
Awesome.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.443
Well, let's go check
out the stockroom,

16:20.445 --> 16:22.113
so that way we'll be
ready for the trucks.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.784
All right, lead the way, boss.

16:27.853 --> 16:29.919
Dude's smooth, you
gotta give him that.

16:29.921 --> 16:32.523
I'd hardly call
that maneuvering.

16:32.525 --> 16:33.923
Are you kidding?

16:33.925 --> 16:35.158
She's a comic fan.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.994
Her favorite comic is
his favorite comic.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.529
She's smoking hot,
and she's new in town

16:39.531 --> 16:41.765
so there's no
longstanding dating pools.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.734
He'd be crazy to pass up
an opportunity like this.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.235
I don't know.

16:45.237 --> 16:48.405
Something tells me this
girl isn't on the market.

16:48.407 --> 16:49.974
Well what, is she
training to be a nun,

16:49.976 --> 16:51.274
and helping troubled youths

16:51.276 --> 16:53.576
through working in
comic book stores?

16:53.578 --> 16:55.046
Sounds like a Hallmark
Channel movie.

16:55.048 --> 16:58.148
I don't know, but my
spider sense is tingling.

16:58.150 --> 17:00.350
He should be careful.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.219
This is Kevin we're
talking about here.

17:02.221 --> 17:06.156
Right, the master
of the emotional belly flop.

17:06.157 --> 17:09.093
Well, she's helping out
when we need her the most.

17:09.095 --> 17:11.362
What could go wrong?

17:11.364 --> 17:12.997
You do realize,
by saying that,

17:12.999 --> 17:14.999
you're practically
begging the universe,

17:15.001 --> 17:18.104
show me, show me
what could go wrong.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.105
I'd think a Constantine
fan would know better

17:21.107 --> 17:23.708
than to tempt fate like that.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.175
I know, yeah,
speakin' of Constantine,

17:25.176 --> 17:27.512
I'll be back in a few hours.

17:28.780 --> 17:29.781
Don't worry.

17:37.889 --> 17:40.124
Man, I would've loved
to see Todd's face

17:40.126 --> 17:42.926
when he found out
Clark was a DC guy.

17:42.928 --> 17:44.929
God, I can't
imagine a worse fate.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.830
Be like if a Star Trek
fan and a Star Wars fan

17:46.832 --> 17:48.465
tried to get married.

17:48.467 --> 17:49.700
Right?

17:49.702 --> 17:51.535
It's like the True
Story, Swear to God.

17:51.537 --> 17:53.269
New comic we just got in.

17:53.271 --> 17:55.005
It's about a guy
from California,

17:55.007 --> 17:57.007
meets a girl from Puerto Rico.

17:57.009 --> 17:58.275
Talked for a couple months.

17:58.277 --> 18:00.978
He flies out to see
ho it'd work out.

18:00.980 --> 18:04.280
They actually live
happily ever after now.

18:04.282 --> 18:06.549
So, what you're saying is

18:06.551 --> 18:09.586
Clark and Todd need to
move to Puerto Rico?

18:09.588 --> 18:10.653
No.

18:10.655 --> 18:13.824
Who's ever happy in Puerto Rico?

18:13.826 --> 18:15.826
I'm just sayin',
Todd's a good guy.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.327
If he wants to make it work,

18:17.329 --> 18:20.931
he's not gonna base it off
of DC versus Marvel comics.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.032
He's just gonna make
sure that the love furls

18:23.034 --> 18:24.868
- and keeps growing.
- Um.

18:24.870 --> 18:28.807
Yeah, how 'bout, um, I
think we're low on bags.

18:30.108 --> 18:31.608
Can you go in the
back and check to see

18:31.610 --> 18:33.345
if we have some bags?

18:36.816 --> 18:38.048
Okay.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.215
I'll go see if we
have some bags.

18:39.217 --> 18:41.820
Okay, you go, you go do that.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.425
Hey, uh, is there anything
I can help ya find?

18:48.427 --> 18:50.227
Uh, yeah, hey, what, what's
up with all these books here?

18:50.229 --> 18:52.296
I thought this was
a comic book store.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.596
Well, yeah, we have
all kinds of stuff

18:53.598 --> 18:54.932
for the sci-fi
and fantasy crowd.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.534
I mean, there's, uh, comics,

18:56.536 --> 18:57.801
there's movies,

18:57.803 --> 18:59.702
there's, uh, action
figures, t-shirts,

18:59.704 --> 19:01.638
and, uh, yeah, some books.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.240
Um, is there anything
specific you're lookin' for?

19:04.242 --> 19:05.742
Uh, you know, I don't know.

19:05.744 --> 19:06.977
I just went on a date with
this chick the other night,

19:06.979 --> 19:08.378
and she's kinda on
the brainy side,

19:08.380 --> 19:10.146
and, uh, she told me,
kinda, she kinda liked

19:10.148 --> 19:11.615
this kind of crap, uh, stuff,

19:11.617 --> 19:13.983
so I figure if I, you
know, learn about it, I'd.

19:13.985 --> 19:15.920
So, you're just
lookin' for some basic...

19:15.922 --> 19:17.387
Yeah, you know,
geek stuff, you know.

19:17.389 --> 19:18.622
I ain't much of a reader.

19:18.624 --> 19:21.525
You got anything
more basic for me?

19:21.527 --> 19:24.961
Um, yeah, how 'bout we start
you off with a comic book?

19:24.963 --> 19:25.798
Sure.

19:29.969 --> 19:30.901
Hey, ain't you a little bit old

19:30.903 --> 19:32.470
to be playin' with dolls?

19:32.472 --> 19:34.637
It's a limited
edition Scarlet Huntress

19:34.639 --> 19:36.272
collectible action figure.

19:36.274 --> 19:37.240
Aren't you a little
male to be playin'

19:37.242 --> 19:38.509
with a girl doll?

19:38.511 --> 19:40.176
Okay, how 'bout
we get you started

19:40.178 --> 19:42.280
with something over here?

19:44.149 --> 19:46.683
Like, um, uh, Spiderman.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.951
He's been pretty popular lately.

19:47.953 --> 19:49.118
Yeah, I seen a
couple of the movies,

19:49.120 --> 19:52.088
but, you know, it seems
kinda, just faggy.

19:52.090 --> 19:53.022
Okay.

19:53.024 --> 19:55.124
Um, how 'bout a graphic novel.

19:55.126 --> 19:56.993
Oh, no, I, no
novels, I don't read.

19:56.995 --> 19:57.862
No, no.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.230
A graphic novel is like

20:00.232 --> 20:02.866
four or five individual
comics bound into one volume.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.501
Oh, okay, that's pretty cool.

20:04.503 --> 20:06.769
Yeah, like, uh,

20:06.771 --> 20:08.471
Dracula versus King Arthur.

20:08.473 --> 20:09.807
Huh.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.775
Well what's this about?

20:11.777 --> 20:13.877
It's Dracula
versus King Arthur.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.479
It's evil versus medieval,

20:15.481 --> 20:16.980
swords clashing, limbs flying,

20:16.982 --> 20:17.914
all the good stuff.

20:17.916 --> 20:19.349
Ah, sounds pretty cool.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.085
Yeah, I think, think
I'll take this.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.286
All right, uh, well Lisa

20:22.288 --> 20:23.420
will ring you up
at the register,

20:23.422 --> 20:24.755
and, uh, you have a good day.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.826
All right, man, thanks.

20:34.165 --> 20:35.766
Bye, thanks for
your patronage.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.101
Did I hear who
I think I heard?

20:37.103 --> 20:39.903
- Um.
- Was that Chuck Hanley?

20:39.905 --> 20:42.038
Eh, he's pretty
rude if you ask me.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.774
I don't care what kind of hot
time he's planned tonight.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.174
He can keep it to himself.

20:45.176 --> 20:46.009
- Hot time?
- No,

20:46.011 --> 20:47.243
it's probably nothing.

20:47.245 --> 20:49.946
Wait, what, wait,
where, with who?

20:49.948 --> 20:51.949
Oh, something at his house.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.983
Probably something explicit.

20:53.985 --> 20:55.385
But don't get freaked out.

20:55.387 --> 20:56.353
Don't get freaked out?

20:56.355 --> 20:57.488
He's over here planning a night

20:57.490 --> 20:59.589
of snacks, conversation,
and date rape

20:59.591 --> 21:00.824
with my ex-girlfriend

21:00.826 --> 21:02.593
and you're tellin'
me not to freak out?

21:02.595 --> 21:04.694
All right, hold on a
minute, Mr. Hyperspace.

21:04.696 --> 21:05.895
- Oh, Mark, I don't think...
- No, no, no,

21:05.897 --> 21:07.631
this needs to be said.

21:07.633 --> 21:10.534
Kevin, I know you're
still in love with Ashley.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.169
Mm mm.

21:12.171 --> 21:13.436
That's great.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.672
But Ashley's her own person,

21:14.674 --> 21:17.475
and she can make
her own decisions.

21:18.376 --> 21:19.542
- But...
- Uh uh.

21:19.544 --> 21:20.778
She's a big girl.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.946
She can take care of herself.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.015
Remember when she broke
Tommy Wilkerson's finger

21:25.017 --> 21:26.215
our sophomore year?

21:26.217 --> 21:27.884
He was only tryin'
to cop a feel.

21:27.886 --> 21:28.887
Yeah, but.

21:31.723 --> 21:33.156
You're right, you're right.

21:33.158 --> 21:35.358
She is my ex-girlfriend.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.161
I'm gonna have to let her go.

21:37.163 --> 21:38.295
That is the most
sensible thing

21:38.297 --> 21:40.633
I've heard you say all week.

21:44.669 --> 21:45.903
Tell me where
we're going again?

21:45.905 --> 21:47.837
Chuck's house.

21:47.839 --> 21:49.339
And why are we going there?

21:49.341 --> 21:52.409
To back Ashley
up if she needs it.

21:52.411 --> 21:55.412
And what happened to all
that Ashley's a big girl stuff?

21:55.414 --> 21:57.448
Lisa said that, not me.

21:57.450 --> 21:58.749
But you didn't contest it.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.217
How could I, I
was outnumbered.

22:00.219 --> 22:02.553
The odds weren't in my favor.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.922
You just didn't want
anyone talking you out of it.

22:04.924 --> 22:05.857
That too.

22:08.394 --> 22:09.259
You know, if Chuck catches us

22:09.261 --> 22:10.094
peeping in his windows,

22:10.096 --> 22:11.327
he's gonna pulverize us.

22:11.329 --> 22:13.830
Then go home, you
don't have to be here.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.634
Well someone has to
call the ambulance.

22:16.636 --> 22:17.934
There it is.

22:17.936 --> 22:18.769
Which one?

22:18.771 --> 22:20.269
That one there.

22:20.271 --> 22:22.306
All right, we're gonna go
around the neighbor's house.

22:22.308 --> 22:24.107
That way we're not goin'
straight up his driveway.

22:24.109 --> 22:24.944
Come on.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.487
Hey, little boy, yeah.

22:36.489 --> 22:37.390
Here ya go.

22:38.590 --> 22:41.858
Defense from the 43.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.093
All right, get down.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.294
Let me climb on your back

22:44.296 --> 22:46.596
and take a look
through the window.

22:46.598 --> 22:47.765
Are you kidding?

22:47.767 --> 22:50.567
Look at you compared to me.

22:50.569 --> 22:52.635
Then what do
you suppose we do?

22:52.637 --> 22:56.006
Defense from the 43.

23:02.947 --> 23:04.213
Hustle, hustle!

23:04.215 --> 23:05.415
Get
it, get it, get it,

23:05.417 --> 23:05.982
you got it, you
got it, you got it.

23:05.984 --> 23:06.817
Yeah!

23:25.738 --> 23:28.971
Well, I know it wasn't
Ashley he was with last night.

23:28.973 --> 23:30.574
She was at Christine and Tom's

23:30.576 --> 23:32.942
playing Dungeons and Dragons.

23:32.944 --> 23:34.211
Great.

23:34.213 --> 23:35.546
And I get Captain
Caveman over here

23:35.548 --> 23:36.980
landing on my head

23:36.982 --> 23:40.752
to protect the virtue
of some sports groupie.

23:42.053 --> 23:43.653
My head still hurts
from where I beamed it

23:43.655 --> 23:45.323
on the water spigot.

23:49.828 --> 23:51.597
I still have a key.

23:52.464 --> 23:54.867
Hey, Ash, how are ya doin'?

23:56.569 --> 23:58.102
I'm all
right, how are you?

23:58.104 --> 24:00.237
Um, oh, we were just

24:00.239 --> 24:01.739
gonna be

24:01.741 --> 24:03.440
somewhere else.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.710
Oh, uh, yeah.

24:05.711 --> 24:08.511
- See ya in a few, Ash.
- See ya.

24:08.513 --> 24:09.848
We need to talk.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.320
You look good.

24:17.322 --> 24:18.256
You look.

24:19.425 --> 24:20.990
So how's the store?

24:20.992 --> 24:22.326
It's good.

24:22.328 --> 24:23.328
How's Chuck?

24:24.530 --> 24:27.364
Oh, you
heard about that?

24:27.366 --> 24:29.633
When you date that
low on the food chain,

24:29.635 --> 24:31.734
- everyone hears about that.
- Listen,

24:31.736 --> 24:33.636
I only went out with
him because Becky

24:33.638 --> 24:36.073
wanted to go out with
Chuck's friend Bill.

24:36.075 --> 24:37.406
Really?

24:37.408 --> 24:38.342
Really.

24:38.344 --> 24:39.409
We went to some sports bar,

24:39.411 --> 24:41.077
and Chuck and Bill were arguing

24:41.079 --> 24:43.680
over the Cleveland
Browns the entire time.

24:43.682 --> 24:45.348
Becky was playing the ditz,

24:45.350 --> 24:46.983
and I was just playing
some movie trivia

24:46.985 --> 24:48.684
on the video screens.

24:48.686 --> 24:51.521
- Is that all?
- That's all.

24:51.523 --> 24:53.957
It's not like I was
spyin' or anything.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.025
Kevin, get real.

24:55.027 --> 24:55.959
We dated for three years.

24:55.961 --> 24:57.693
I know you were spying on me.

24:57.695 --> 25:00.163
Okay, I was spyin'.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.165
I couldn't believe you
would go out with Chuck.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.067
Well that makes two of us.

25:05.069 --> 25:06.137
I miss you.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.405
And I miss you,
and Mark, and Lisa,

25:09.407 --> 25:11.775
and everyone at the store.

25:11.777 --> 25:14.044
You guys are my friends.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.980
And, Kevin, you're
my best friend.

25:16.982 --> 25:19.549
And just because we
can't date anymore,

25:19.551 --> 25:22.819
I don't want that to
change everything.

25:22.821 --> 25:24.954
I guess you're right.

25:24.956 --> 25:27.691
You know I still love
you though, right?

25:27.693 --> 25:29.792
And I love you.

25:29.794 --> 25:31.461
It's just,

25:31.463 --> 25:32.962
we're gonna have
to find another way

25:32.964 --> 25:34.699
to express that love.

25:37.435 --> 25:40.503
Have you guys been
listening the whole time?

25:43.509 --> 25:46.178
It's just so beautiful!

25:51.082 --> 25:53.217
All right, let's
move on to X-Men.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.318
- Finished.
- Really?

25:55.320 --> 25:56.452
Well then...

25:56.454 --> 25:58.654
Yep, everything's finished.

25:58.656 --> 25:59.957
Everything?

25:59.959 --> 26:01.191
When you were outside,

26:01.193 --> 26:02.659
and that guy was tryin'
to sell you 50 copies

26:02.661 --> 26:04.294
of Death Note number one,

26:04.296 --> 26:06.296
I got ahead a little.

26:06.298 --> 26:10.133
Wow, uh, we've never
finished this early before.

26:10.135 --> 26:12.803
Since working Comic
Con, this is kinda easy.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.070
You worked Comic Con?

26:14.072 --> 26:15.471
Yeah, at the Vertigo booth.

26:15.473 --> 26:17.340
My friend does
promo work for them.

26:17.342 --> 26:18.575
They needed a female
who didn't mind

26:18.577 --> 26:21.144
cheap exploitation
to work their booth.

26:21.146 --> 26:22.645
And you?

26:22.647 --> 26:25.048
Have enough college
loans looming over my head

26:25.050 --> 26:27.683
to overlook a little
partial nudity.

26:27.685 --> 26:28.951
It was a zoo.

26:28.953 --> 26:30.721
I haven't been hit on
by that many teenagers

26:30.723 --> 26:34.024
since I wore a corset to
the Twilight premiere.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.358
Yeah.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.427
It was a zoo.

26:37.663 --> 26:39.829
So what does Lisa
do for a living?

26:39.831 --> 26:41.832
It's complicated.

26:41.834 --> 26:44.300
So is my relationship
status on Facebook,

26:44.302 --> 26:46.603
but that doesn't
tell me anything.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.372
Speaking of
relationship statuses,

26:48.374 --> 26:49.538
did you hear about
the epic breakup

26:49.540 --> 26:51.374
between me and my ex-girlfriend?

26:51.376 --> 26:54.278
- How long did you guys date?
- Three years.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.179
Ouch, sorry.

26:56.181 --> 26:57.681
Yeah, guess I don't blame her

26:57.683 --> 26:59.282
for breakin' up with me.

26:59.284 --> 27:00.616
What'd you do?

27:00.618 --> 27:02.019
Cheat on her?

27:02.021 --> 27:03.553
Forget her birthday?

27:03.555 --> 27:06.123
Call her Princess
Leia during sex?

27:06.125 --> 27:07.490
No,

27:07.492 --> 27:09.226
turns out we're related.

27:09.228 --> 27:12.229
- We're second cousins.
- And?

27:12.231 --> 27:13.430
And.

27:13.432 --> 27:15.031
So why'd she
break up with you?

27:15.033 --> 27:17.166
I just said, we're
second cousins.

27:17.168 --> 27:18.468
That sounds like
a stupid reason

27:18.470 --> 27:19.936
to breakup a
three-year relationship

27:19.938 --> 27:21.505
if you ask me.

27:21.507 --> 27:23.240
We're not in
West Virginia here.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.041
We don't date relatives.

27:25.043 --> 27:26.876
Oh, please, Ohio has no laws

27:26.878 --> 27:28.845
regarding second
cousins marrying.

27:28.847 --> 27:31.515
And if she really feels
the need to have a baby,

27:31.517 --> 27:33.583
which, personally,
I don't understand.

27:33.585 --> 27:35.018
I'd feel like they
guy from Alien

27:35.020 --> 27:37.954
with the monster
inside my chest.

27:37.956 --> 27:40.356
But there's always sperm banks.

27:40.358 --> 27:42.858
Look, dude, my point
is, if it's love,

27:42.860 --> 27:44.095
you find a way.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.230
Guess you're right.

27:48.232 --> 27:49.732
Well hey,
I got some things

27:49.734 --> 27:51.000
to tidy up in the back.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.169
Can you be here tomorrow,

27:52.171 --> 27:53.737
and I'll get your
schedule all worked out?

27:53.739 --> 27:56.241
Tomorrow it is, Professor X.

28:03.514 --> 28:06.048
Oh hey, Lisa, you
work here, too?

28:06.050 --> 28:08.886
No, I just hang
out here, a lot.

28:10.021 --> 28:12.923
So what's up with
Todd and Clark?

28:12.925 --> 28:14.624
I don't think
that's gonna work out.

28:14.626 --> 28:18.461
I mean, Clark is,
uh, into DC Comics.

28:18.463 --> 28:19.528
What's wrong with DC?

28:19.530 --> 28:21.431
Superman, Batman.

28:21.433 --> 28:25.167
- Todd is a Marvel man.
- How much so?

28:25.169 --> 28:27.170
Well, you could ask his dogs,

28:27.172 --> 28:28.805
Stan and Lee.

28:28.807 --> 28:31.441
Ouch.

28:31.443 --> 28:32.942
Well, speaking of going out,

28:32.944 --> 28:34.644
are you seeing anyone?

28:34.646 --> 28:35.481
Me, no.

28:37.383 --> 28:38.749
Why is that so absurd,

28:38.751 --> 28:40.549
someone asking you out?

28:40.551 --> 28:43.519
It's just, people
don't ask me out.

28:43.521 --> 28:44.453
How long has it been

28:44.455 --> 28:46.789
since someone asked you out?

28:46.791 --> 28:48.557
Two years.

28:48.559 --> 28:50.093
Two years?

28:50.095 --> 28:53.262
You're a human female who
hangs out in a comic shop,

28:53.264 --> 28:54.530
and you're single?

28:54.532 --> 28:55.865
There's no way.

28:55.867 --> 28:57.933
It's just I'm
not very interested

28:57.935 --> 28:59.568
in the guys who hang out here,

28:59.570 --> 29:01.637
and it probably shows.

29:01.639 --> 29:03.272
I'm sure it does.

29:03.274 --> 29:06.143
So would you like to go
out with me sometime?

29:06.145 --> 29:08.178
What, you mean like get
a group of gals together

29:08.180 --> 29:11.314
and have like a
girls' night out?

29:11.316 --> 29:13.749
No, I was thinking
more like dinner.

29:13.751 --> 29:15.551
I know this really cool bistro

29:15.553 --> 29:16.920
down in the Flats.

29:16.922 --> 29:19.189
This bitchin' lesbian
couple owns it.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.891
That way, you can hold
a pretty girl's hand

29:20.893 --> 29:24.094
over dinner and nobody
looks at you weird.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.329
Oh, that, um.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.164
I, uh.

29:28.166 --> 29:29.399
Look, if I'm not your
type, you can let me know.

29:29.401 --> 29:30.636
I'm a big girl.

29:31.837 --> 29:33.838
- I'm not gay.
- Oh shit.

29:36.474 --> 29:39.310
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay, really.

29:40.511 --> 29:42.445
I tried feelin'
you out verbally,

29:42.447 --> 29:43.646
and then when you
said you weren't

29:43.648 --> 29:45.115
into the guys at the shop...

29:45.117 --> 29:46.549
It's really okay.

29:46.551 --> 29:49.986
I'm actually really
flattered that you'd ask.

29:49.988 --> 29:52.955
Why not, you're
super funny, smart,

29:52.957 --> 29:54.459
- and cute.
- Thanks.

29:55.993 --> 29:57.661
Well, look, if I haven't
already made you feel

29:57.663 --> 29:59.061
massively uncomfortable,

29:59.063 --> 30:00.529
how 'bout I make it up to you?

30:00.531 --> 30:01.998
Dinner.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.367
Maybe not the bistro, but
Denny's, Taco Bell, whatever.

30:05.369 --> 30:08.305
Even though we can't be
more than just friends?

30:08.307 --> 30:10.406
Well there's no just about it.

30:10.408 --> 30:12.108
I'd be happy to be your friend.

30:12.110 --> 30:13.477
You're fascinating.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.211
And I'd like to get
to know you better.

30:15.213 --> 30:16.214
As a friend.

30:17.415 --> 30:19.281
I'd like that, too.

30:19.283 --> 30:20.650
Well, look, I gotta boogie.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.452
Let Kevin know I'll be
here in the morning.

30:23.454 --> 30:24.622
Sure.

30:31.363 --> 30:32.929
Where's Carley?

30:32.931 --> 30:34.163
She had to go.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.499
She said she'd be
in tomorrow morning.

30:36.501 --> 30:39.269
- She's incredible.
- Yeah, she's really cool.

30:39.271 --> 30:40.503
Yeah.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.571
She's like an expert
in every comic.

30:42.573 --> 30:45.942
She's more
knowledgeable than I am.

30:45.944 --> 30:47.611
Swear, breakin' up with Ashley

30:47.613 --> 30:50.646
is actually lookin' like a
blessing in disguise right now.

30:50.648 --> 30:52.848
Um, yeah, about that...

30:52.850 --> 30:54.384
Yeah, yeah, don't worry.

30:54.386 --> 30:57.220
I'm not obsessin'
about Ashley anymore.

30:57.222 --> 31:00.022
But obsessin' about
Carley's a different story.

31:00.024 --> 31:01.691
Think she likes me?

31:01.693 --> 31:04.029
She likes you well enough.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.096
But you think it's
too soon after Ashley.

31:07.098 --> 31:08.698
I get it.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.902
But, Lisa, I'm a man
of the 21st century,

31:11.904 --> 31:16.573
and information nowadays
moves at the speed of light.

31:16.575 --> 31:20.009
Wait to long and an
opportunity can pass you by.

31:20.011 --> 31:22.278
Think she has a guy?

31:22.280 --> 31:25.981
Oh, I don't think any
guy could interest her.

31:25.983 --> 31:29.486
Right, she does have that
unattainable vibe about her.

31:29.488 --> 31:33.056
But, hey, odds weren't in my
favor for dating my cousin.

31:33.058 --> 31:36.593
So, odds must not
apply in my life.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.628
- Odds are that...
- Hey, I gotta go call Mark,

31:39.630 --> 31:41.830
and let him know
what's goin' on.

31:41.832 --> 31:43.066
It's a good thing I told him

31:43.068 --> 31:45.234
not to come in today
after the movie.

31:45.236 --> 31:48.571
It would've ruined
my Carley time.

31:48.573 --> 31:51.909
You think you can
keep an eye on things?

31:54.413 --> 31:56.779
Now, everybody
take your seats.

31:56.781 --> 32:00.018
And prepare yourselves
for the debut of

32:00.819 --> 32:02.320
Sci-Fi Armageddon.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.623
Here are the decks.

32:06.625 --> 32:10.160
Wait, are these cards that
we build a deck out of, or?

32:10.162 --> 32:11.094
No.

32:11.096 --> 32:12.695
Each box is a well-maintained

32:12.697 --> 32:14.364
and well-balanced playing deck

32:14.366 --> 32:15.464
suited to each player's

32:15.466 --> 32:17.634
individual personalities
and abilities.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.136
A deck this big?

32:20.973 --> 32:23.440
Ash, I'm combining
the mythologies

32:23.442 --> 32:26.242
of eight major and six
minor sci-fi universes

32:26.244 --> 32:27.676
into one game.

32:27.678 --> 32:29.112
There are an unbelievable
amount of scenarios

32:29.114 --> 32:30.814
at play here.

32:30.816 --> 32:33.717
Commander Worf
orders a suicide attack

32:33.719 --> 32:37.554
on the star destroyer
circling Babylon 5.

32:37.556 --> 32:38.922
Expend nine.

32:38.924 --> 32:42.392
Screw God, I've got
my own power cards

32:42.394 --> 32:46.695
to avoid using your
portion of Star Fleet.

32:46.697 --> 32:48.367
That's a good one.

32:49.867 --> 32:51.134
All right, everybody start out

32:51.136 --> 32:53.502
with your early
sci-fi writer sets.

32:53.504 --> 32:55.438
And set out any Isaac
Asimovs, Heinleins,

32:55.440 --> 32:57.943
or Arthur C. Clarkes you have.

33:00.111 --> 33:01.443
I think it's too weird.

33:01.445 --> 33:03.712
I'll excuse myself and
say I'm gonna get sick,

33:03.714 --> 33:05.515
and you can come
help me hold my hair,

33:05.517 --> 33:07.384
and we can sneak
out, watch Dr. Who.

33:07.386 --> 33:08.619
Sounds great.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.092
Ooh, a Stargate.

33:16.094 --> 33:17.861
I get away from the Sith Lords.

33:17.863 --> 33:19.828
Speaking of those
who darken the force,

33:19.830 --> 33:23.333
guess who was in the
store yet again today?

33:23.335 --> 33:24.800
What, was Spenser in again

33:24.802 --> 33:27.903
claiming Jack Kirby
invented Star Wars?

33:27.905 --> 33:30.075
No, it was Chuck Hanley!

33:31.242 --> 33:32.410
Oh dear God.

33:34.279 --> 33:35.979
Anyways, he was in there

33:35.981 --> 33:38.647
tryin' to learn
about geek stuff.

33:38.649 --> 33:39.883
He came in yesterday,

33:39.885 --> 33:43.920
and asked what kind
of stuff Ashley reads.

33:43.922 --> 33:45.989
Somebody shoot me now.

33:45.991 --> 33:47.790
What'd you tell him?

33:47.792 --> 33:49.826
I tried to throw him off,

33:49.828 --> 33:53.730
- uh, telling him...
- Spit it out, elf girl.

33:53.732 --> 33:56.932
Telling him you read
a lot of lesbian erotica

33:56.934 --> 33:58.169
graphic novels.

33:59.870 --> 34:01.070
And?

34:01.072 --> 34:03.073
- And he bought six books.
- Ew!

34:03.075 --> 34:05.808
Seemed really
excited about it, too.

34:05.810 --> 34:07.242
Ew.

34:07.244 --> 34:10.212
I'm putting down a
brigade of space marines.

34:10.214 --> 34:11.480
Great.

34:11.482 --> 34:12.748
That saves you from
both my sarlacc pit

34:12.751 --> 34:14.949
and Kevin's Cylon Basestar.

34:14.952 --> 34:16.185
Seriously, Mark?

34:16.187 --> 34:18.920
You used the 1970s
Cylon Baseship?

34:18.922 --> 34:20.489
Well I didn't have a choice.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.091
That newer series
was an abomination

34:22.092 --> 34:24.194
against the gods of sci-fi.

34:24.196 --> 34:25.594
I know, heaven
forbid we add depth

34:25.597 --> 34:27.464
or shading to our characters.

34:27.466 --> 34:30.632
Yeah, and it becomes
I Was a Teenage Cylon.

34:30.635 --> 34:31.734
The only thing
worthwhile on that show

34:31.735 --> 34:33.601
was Katee Sackhoff.

34:33.603 --> 34:35.773
My kinda woman.

34:38.443 --> 34:41.009
Kaylee Frye, uh, from Firefly.

34:41.011 --> 34:44.480
I just discovered I had
a Kaylee in my deck.

34:44.482 --> 34:45.813
Wow, Mark, I'm
surprised you're using

34:45.815 --> 34:48.884
such a new series as
Firefly in your deck.

34:48.886 --> 34:49.821
Well, in,

34:51.089 --> 34:53.455
in this era of
cross-platforming,

34:53.456 --> 34:54.556
we have to appeal

34:54.559 --> 34:57.192
- to such a wide fan base.
- I made him.

34:57.194 --> 34:58.028
Really?

34:59.231 --> 35:00.863
Yeah, I've been,
uh, alpha testing

35:00.865 --> 35:02.799
this monstrosity with him.

35:02.801 --> 35:05.200
Told him if he didn't
pander to the Brown Coats,

35:05.202 --> 35:06.201
I'd leave him to test things

35:06.203 --> 35:07.404
with this Vietnamese kid

35:07.406 --> 35:09.538
who stalks him on Twitter.

35:09.540 --> 35:11.975
And she dumps this
on me last week.

35:11.977 --> 35:15.912
So I need to integrate
60 new cards in six days.

35:15.914 --> 35:18.680
And when did you
spring this on him?

35:18.682 --> 35:19.915
Last week,

35:19.917 --> 35:23.153
after you said how
much you like Firefly.

35:23.155 --> 35:24.990
Aw, that's so sweet.

36:24.281 --> 36:26.616
- Hey.
- Hey, Clark.

36:26.618 --> 36:29.084
I've been doing a lot of
soul-searching lately,

36:29.086 --> 36:32.354
and I really thought I
found the perfect guy,

36:32.356 --> 36:34.122
but I keep asking myself,

36:34.124 --> 36:35.124
can I really be with someone

36:35.126 --> 36:37.894
that only reads DC Comics?

36:37.896 --> 36:40.029
I looked deep into my heart,

36:40.031 --> 36:41.830
and I've come to a conclusion,

36:41.832 --> 36:44.668
and the answer is
no, not so much.

36:59.251 --> 37:02.084
I wish I could've
been there for that.

37:02.086 --> 37:04.053
You know, I think
Kevin's developing

37:04.055 --> 37:05.787
a little crush on you.

37:05.789 --> 37:08.658
- Oh, you noticed that, too.
- Mm hmm.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.759
Yeah, I wonder if I can
just let him down easily,

37:10.761 --> 37:12.294
or if I just ignore
his advances,

37:12.296 --> 37:13.962
maybe he'll go away.

37:13.964 --> 37:15.832
This is Kevin
we're talking about.

37:15.834 --> 37:18.801
Remember the dog through
the window incident?

37:18.803 --> 37:19.971
Ay, caramba.

37:21.138 --> 37:23.138
So what are you doin'
two nights from tonight?

37:23.140 --> 37:24.607
Nothing.

37:24.609 --> 37:26.575
I'm officially bumming
for company all week, why?

37:26.577 --> 37:29.011
You wanna
come over for some D&D?

37:29.013 --> 37:31.314
Dungeons and Dragons?

37:31.316 --> 37:32.149
Sure.

37:33.551 --> 37:36.586
I don't know, I'm not
very good around new people.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.087
Oh, don't worry.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.721
These are some of my best
friends in the whole world,

37:39.723 --> 37:43.160
and I promise you will
have a great time.

37:44.595 --> 37:47.830
If it means that
much to you, then okay.

37:47.832 --> 37:48.932
Good.

37:48.934 --> 37:51.301
And it's a pressure-free
platonic date.

37:51.303 --> 37:52.868
But this means I get to choose

37:52.870 --> 37:55.004
what's on the agenda
tomorrow night.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.171
Tomorrow night?

37:56.173 --> 37:57.674
We're hanging out
tomorrow night as well?

37:57.676 --> 37:59.676
- Are you doin' anything?
- No, but...

37:59.678 --> 38:00.910
But nothing.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.879
You're coming over to
Kevin's for movie night.

38:02.881 --> 38:04.013
Movie night?

38:04.015 --> 38:05.314
Two times a month,

38:05.316 --> 38:07.383
Kevin, Todd, Mark,
Ashley, and myself

38:07.385 --> 38:11.453
get together, watch new
and or classic films.

38:11.455 --> 38:12.921
It's my turn to choose the film,

38:12.923 --> 38:16.694
and I found this really
awesome indie romcom.

38:18.028 --> 38:19.194
Well are you sure
they don't mind

38:19.196 --> 38:21.397
bringing somebody
without checking first?

38:21.399 --> 38:23.366
I don't wanna impose myself.

38:23.368 --> 38:24.700
Whatever, you're awesome.

38:24.702 --> 38:27.569
No one can complain
about my bringing you.

38:27.571 --> 38:30.406
Mm, well then it's
two platonic dates.

38:30.408 --> 38:31.607
If we keep this up,

38:31.609 --> 38:33.542
we'll need to petition Webster's

38:33.544 --> 38:35.812
to expand the
definition of platonic

38:35.814 --> 38:38.113
to include platonically
going steady.

38:38.115 --> 38:39.048
Are you kidding?

38:39.050 --> 38:40.950
I'm a regular platonic Don Juan.

38:44.356 --> 38:47.624
Okay,
guys, so what's first?

38:47.626 --> 38:48.725
I was thinkin'
we could either go

38:48.727 --> 38:50.828
classic sci-fi or Marvel.

38:51.930 --> 38:54.997
Uh, Star Wars, original
trilogy of course.

38:54.999 --> 38:57.466
Close Encounters, Saturn 13.

38:57.468 --> 39:01.238
Iron Man, Iron Man 2,
Thor, Captain America.

39:02.374 --> 39:06.011
How about a movie
we've never seen before?

39:08.078 --> 39:10.513
You know, like, a new movie?

39:10.515 --> 39:13.182
You don't watch new
movies with your friends.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.017
Seriously, never?

39:15.019 --> 39:16.618
New movies are a dicey thing.

39:16.620 --> 39:18.354
I mean, you're
either gonna like 'em

39:18.356 --> 39:19.555
or you're gonna spend
the whole evening

39:19.557 --> 39:20.823
writhing in agony,

39:20.825 --> 39:23.792
hoping for it to be over with.

39:23.794 --> 39:25.261
Yeah, you know.

39:25.263 --> 39:27.562
Like, you like the movie, but
your friend could hate it.

39:27.564 --> 39:28.765
And then you just
spent your whole night

39:28.767 --> 39:30.966
arguing about who's right.

39:30.968 --> 39:32.669
I mean, either way,

39:32.671 --> 39:35.571
it's an uncomfortable
place to be in.

39:35.573 --> 39:37.839
But, Kevin, we
always used to watch

39:37.841 --> 39:39.875
new movies together.

39:39.877 --> 39:42.377
Yeah, no we didn't.

39:42.379 --> 39:44.247
What are you talking about?

39:44.249 --> 39:47.116
We used to watch new movies
together all the time.

39:47.118 --> 39:49.185
We would pick out what we
wanted the night before,

39:49.187 --> 39:50.886
and then I would pick
it up and bring it over

39:50.888 --> 39:52.522
on my way to your house.

39:52.524 --> 39:55.058
Yeah, but I'd download
it the night before,

39:55.060 --> 39:56.325
'cause, you know, I like

39:56.327 --> 39:57.560
watchin' my movies
straight through,

39:57.562 --> 39:59.828
and half the time,
we'd be makin' out.

39:59.830 --> 40:01.830
So you pre-watched the movie

40:01.832 --> 40:04.500
so you wouldn't miss
anything by kissing me?

40:04.502 --> 40:06.334
Hey, I didn't
do it just for me.

40:06.336 --> 40:08.303
I did it for you, too.

40:08.305 --> 40:09.805
Oh really?

40:09.807 --> 40:11.540
Yeah, I'd time it out.

40:11.542 --> 40:12.941
That way, when we
were making out

40:12.943 --> 40:14.576
during the bad times,

40:14.578 --> 40:15.511
and through the
rest of the time,

40:15.513 --> 40:18.714
we'd just be watchin' the movie.

40:18.716 --> 40:20.816
Well, we did have a ton of sex

40:20.818 --> 40:22.653
during the sex scenes.

40:23.888 --> 40:25.520
Yeah, we did.

40:25.522 --> 40:27.557
Dude, the average
sex scene in a movie

40:27.559 --> 40:29.991
is under 120 seconds.

40:29.993 --> 40:33.296
Hey, I found the
pause button, okay?

40:33.298 --> 40:36.866
At least you could
find that button.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.636
Boom, in your face.

40:48.713 --> 40:50.712
Guys, this is so weird.

40:50.714 --> 40:52.214
So I went on a date
for the first time

40:52.216 --> 40:53.783
since the breakup
last night, right?

40:53.785 --> 40:55.417
Yay!

40:55.419 --> 40:56.685
I don't know.

40:56.687 --> 40:57.720
We really didn't connect
or anything like that.

40:57.722 --> 40:58.955
Oh.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.223
But guess what?

41:00.225 --> 41:01.691
People are comin' up to me,

41:01.693 --> 41:04.794
makin' comments to me
about my date last night.

41:04.796 --> 41:07.229
Things that they
shouldn't even know about.

41:07.231 --> 41:08.830
Like, Spenser came up to me

41:08.832 --> 41:10.098
and asked me how the movie was

41:10.100 --> 41:12.200
that me and her went to.

41:12.202 --> 41:14.035
I didn't tell anybody
about what I did last night

41:14.037 --> 41:15.772
until just now.

41:15.774 --> 41:17.707
And then I have Miss
Giggle Fits over here

41:17.709 --> 41:19.241
makin' comments about
me takin' my date

41:19.243 --> 41:20.609
to dinner at Denny's.

41:20.611 --> 41:21.743
Well, gee, you really know how

41:21.745 --> 41:23.845
to spoil a girl, don't you?

41:23.847 --> 41:27.049
Anyways, how'd
she know about that?

41:27.051 --> 41:28.917
Maybe because guys
have no imagination

41:28.919 --> 41:31.187
when it comes to planning dates?

41:31.189 --> 41:32.988
Who was
your date anyways?

41:32.990 --> 41:35.091
This chick Stephanie.

41:35.093 --> 41:39.263
That wouldn't happen to
be Stephanie Lane, would it?

41:40.131 --> 41:40.962
Wait a minute, am I,

41:40.964 --> 41:42.901
am I in a reality show?

41:43.834 --> 41:45.700
How do you know that?

41:45.702 --> 41:47.569
Oh my God, don't you know?

41:47.571 --> 41:49.305
She's a famous blogger.

41:49.307 --> 41:50.406
Stephanie Lane?

41:50.408 --> 41:52.073
- So?
- So, do you know

41:52.075 --> 41:53.642
what her blog is called?

41:53.644 --> 41:54.843
Enlighten me.

41:54.845 --> 41:56.745
It's called Parade of Losers.

41:56.747 --> 41:58.046
It's about her love life,

41:58.048 --> 42:00.816
how she goes on dates
with guys, get it?

42:00.818 --> 42:02.084
I mean, she even goes on dates

42:02.086 --> 42:04.252
with guys she's really
not that interested in

42:04.254 --> 42:06.955
just so she can write
about 'em in her blog.

42:06.957 --> 42:09.325
I read that all the time.

42:09.327 --> 42:11.894
In fact, I read the one today,

42:11.896 --> 42:14.930
and oh my God!

42:17.734 --> 42:18.700
Oh my God!

42:18.702 --> 42:19.535
I need to go.

42:24.575 --> 42:26.010
What a jackass.

42:28.412 --> 42:29.246
I mean.

42:31.415 --> 42:32.247
Hey.

42:32.249 --> 42:33.448
Hey.

42:33.450 --> 42:35.785
So what's first on
the Microplex tonight?

42:35.787 --> 42:37.687
It's a Ranma 1/2 fan film.

42:37.689 --> 42:39.589
It's called Three
Sides To Every Story.

42:39.591 --> 42:41.691
- The female Ranma is super hot.
- Oh.

42:41.693 --> 42:44.593
Anyway, what's for snacks?

42:44.595 --> 42:47.598
I made some
delicious OB brownies.

42:48.867 --> 42:52.067
- Oh you doll!
- You know, my famous ones.

42:52.069 --> 42:53.803
So what are OBs?

42:53.805 --> 42:56.906
- Orgasm brownies.
- Come again?

42:56.908 --> 42:58.406
Pun intended.

42:58.408 --> 43:00.743
They're these homemade
brownies that Ashley makes.

43:00.745 --> 43:03.279
They're so good, they'll
make you cream in your pants.

43:03.281 --> 43:04.881
Mm, I'm beginning
to see the whole lure

43:04.883 --> 43:06.682
of this movie night.

43:06.684 --> 43:08.551
Yeah, me too.

43:08.553 --> 43:11.354
If it wasn't for Lisa, this
would've died out years ago.

43:11.356 --> 43:13.522
She loves these little
get-together things.

43:13.524 --> 43:15.457
Wow, I'm beginning to
see what a special lady

43:15.459 --> 43:17.158
she really is.

43:17.160 --> 43:19.794
You know, you'll never
find a more dedicated friend,

43:19.796 --> 43:21.964
or a fan of Tolkien
for that matter.

43:21.966 --> 43:23.966
I don't know how she keeps
all that trivia straight,

43:23.968 --> 43:25.834
especially with her
day job and everything.

43:25.836 --> 43:27.069
Day job?

43:27.071 --> 43:29.305
Yeah, she hasn't told
you, not even a hint?

43:29.307 --> 43:31.006
She's actually a physicist.

43:31.008 --> 43:32.040
A physicist?

43:32.042 --> 43:33.408
Affirmative.

43:33.410 --> 43:34.343
Don't you have to go to school

43:34.345 --> 43:35.711
for, like, life for that?

43:35.713 --> 43:37.680
Yeah, pretty much.

43:37.682 --> 43:40.415
But luckily she graduated
high school early.

43:40.417 --> 43:42.417
She actually
graduated at age 13,

43:42.419 --> 43:44.687
got her bachelor's
degree at age 15,

43:44.689 --> 43:46.555
got her master's at age 17,

43:46.557 --> 43:49.292
and got her first
doctorate at age 20.

43:49.294 --> 43:51.160
Wait, her first doctorate?

43:51.162 --> 43:52.395
Yeah, she's got two.

43:52.397 --> 43:56.064
Theoretical physics
and string theory.

43:56.066 --> 43:57.232
Damn.

43:57.234 --> 43:58.533
I hear ya on that.

43:58.535 --> 44:02.203
But our Miss Lisa is
a certified genius.

44:02.205 --> 44:03.207
Oh my God!

44:04.441 --> 44:05.941
"Yet to cross that Rubicon

44:05.943 --> 44:08.611
"between late adolescence
and true adulthood.

44:08.613 --> 44:12.080
"An almost slavish devotion
to his mindless pursuits.

44:12.082 --> 44:15.718
"What kind of man owns
a comic book store?"

44:15.720 --> 44:18.687
Oh, God, Kevin,
guys, I almost forgot,

44:18.689 --> 44:20.522
I was over at Mage's
earlier today.

44:20.524 --> 44:21.790
Mark, why would you be going

44:21.792 --> 44:24.426
to our competition
on the West Side?

44:24.428 --> 44:26.562
I was going over to
wreck their alphabetizing.

44:26.564 --> 44:28.497
You were what?

44:28.499 --> 44:30.899
Yeah, I figured that
if people couldn't find

44:30.901 --> 44:32.167
what they were looking for,

44:32.169 --> 44:33.468
they'd come to us.

44:33.470 --> 44:35.870
Our store is
awfully neat and tidy.

44:35.872 --> 44:37.138
Gee, do you think it's maybe

44:37.140 --> 44:39.075
because we have four
times as many staff

44:39.077 --> 44:41.377
as Kevin needs for
a store that size?

44:41.379 --> 44:44.613
"My date, however, had
an almost slavish devotion

44:44.615 --> 44:46.048
"to his mindless pursuits,

44:46.050 --> 44:49.551
"droning on ad nauseum
about minute differences

44:49.553 --> 44:52.587
"between seasons of
science fiction TV shows

44:52.589 --> 44:54.055
"like they matter,

44:54.057 --> 44:57.759
"as opposed to being the
militaristic power fantasies

44:57.761 --> 45:00.229
"of arrested development
that they are."

45:00.231 --> 45:01.964
All I said is the
first three seasons

45:01.966 --> 45:05.167
of Battlestar Galactica
were better than the last.

45:05.169 --> 45:06.935
Anyway, that's not the point.

45:06.937 --> 45:08.470
What is the point anyways?

45:08.472 --> 45:10.705
Besides the one on your head.

45:10.707 --> 45:12.841
The point is that
Mage's is gone!

45:12.843 --> 45:15.144
Gone, what the hell happened?

45:15.146 --> 45:16.412
I don't know.

45:16.414 --> 45:17.879
We'll have to do some
recon there tomorrow.

45:17.881 --> 45:19.749
There's some new place
there called Ian's Comics.

45:19.751 --> 45:22.017
Okay, all they did
was change owners.

45:22.019 --> 45:23.252
Listen to this,

45:23.254 --> 45:25.354
"Like far too many men his age,

45:25.356 --> 45:27.689
"I found my date had yet
to cross that Rubicon

45:27.691 --> 45:30.426
"between late adolescence

45:30.428 --> 45:33.763
"He seemed obsessed with
toys, picture books,

45:33.765 --> 45:35.163
"and animated features.

45:35.165 --> 45:38.000
"While there's nothing
wrong with these,

45:38.002 --> 45:39.234
"I guess,

45:39.236 --> 45:40.468
"those just happen
to be interests

45:40.470 --> 45:42.805
"of my six-year-old nephew."

45:42.807 --> 45:43.908
That bitch.

45:46.410 --> 45:47.244
It's okay.

45:49.781 --> 45:52.580
You think your parents will
care if we take some shots?

45:52.582 --> 45:54.751
- Way ahead of you.
- Yeah!

45:56.421 --> 45:58.020
Dude,

45:58.022 --> 46:00.756
you're striking out
all over the place.

46:00.758 --> 46:03.426
And I should know about
that better than anybody.

46:03.428 --> 46:04.261
But

46:05.396 --> 46:06.761
there's something I
gotta talk to you about,

46:06.763 --> 46:09.832
and it's kind of important.

46:09.834 --> 46:12.000
All right, dude, what's up?

46:12.002 --> 46:13.504
You know, Kevin,

46:15.539 --> 46:19.142
certain things can be
hard to say to people

46:21.211 --> 46:23.145
because you, you can
never really know

46:23.147 --> 46:26.649
how other people will
take the certain things

46:26.651 --> 46:27.484
you say.

46:29.252 --> 46:32.654
Uh, do you, do you kinda
get what I'm tryin' to say?

46:32.656 --> 46:33.955
No, dude.

46:33.957 --> 46:36.524
As of right now, I
can't say that I do.

46:36.526 --> 46:39.294
What are you talkin' about?

46:39.296 --> 46:42.163
Certain subjects
in our society

46:42.165 --> 46:44.102
are still kinda touchy,

46:46.771 --> 46:48.736
and when they're touchy,

46:48.738 --> 46:52.409
things can be kind of
hard to say to people.

46:56.147 --> 46:57.712
Things like

46:57.714 --> 47:00.084
someone's sexual orientation.

47:02.419 --> 47:03.253
Go on.

47:05.089 --> 47:07.758
Well, uh, it, it's hard to say

47:08.959 --> 47:10.792
because it is such
a touchy subject,

47:10.794 --> 47:11.628
but

47:13.097 --> 47:14.562
you can,

47:14.564 --> 47:16.999
you can think that
you know somebody,

47:17.001 --> 47:20.703
but they'll always have
this place inside themselves

47:20.705 --> 47:22.303
that's

47:22.305 --> 47:23.140
private.

47:24.908 --> 47:25.742
And,

47:27.245 --> 47:28.276
and it, it,

47:28.278 --> 47:29.511
things just never come up,

47:29.513 --> 47:30.979
so you don't say
anything about it,

47:30.981 --> 47:32.714
but there's always this

47:32.716 --> 47:33.984
sort of secret.

47:36.921 --> 47:40.189
And you can be
afraid of how people

47:40.191 --> 47:43.294
will react when they
learn the truth.

47:44.428 --> 47:47.296
Do you, do you kinda
understand what,

47:47.298 --> 47:49.430
what I'm tryin' to say?

47:49.432 --> 47:52.502
Dude, wow.

47:54.171 --> 47:55.740
Wow, yeah, I think.

47:57.307 --> 48:00.609
Yeah, I couldn't
believe it either.

48:00.611 --> 48:02.613
How long did you know?

48:03.747 --> 48:05.015
Not too long.

48:08.252 --> 48:10.588
Man, dude, no matter what,

48:11.522 --> 48:14.622
we're always gonna be friends.

48:14.624 --> 48:15.823
If you're gay, dude,

48:15.825 --> 48:18.195
that's totally
cool with me, man.

48:19.062 --> 48:20.662
Wait, what?

48:20.664 --> 48:22.363
I said we're still
gonna be friends

48:22.365 --> 48:23.934
whether you're gay.

48:25.870 --> 48:27.269
No!

48:27.271 --> 48:28.606
No, no, God, no!

48:29.941 --> 48:33.042
God, dude, I wasn't, I
wasn't talking about me!

48:33.044 --> 48:34.843
Wait, you weren't?

48:34.845 --> 48:35.680
God.

48:36.546 --> 48:37.645
Heaven's no, dude,

48:37.647 --> 48:39.916
I was talking about Carley.

48:42.319 --> 48:45.988
No, dude, she,
she's not like that.

48:45.990 --> 48:46.991
Way, dude.

48:48.258 --> 48:49.792
Dude, no.

48:49.794 --> 48:52.328
You're just jealous 'cause
she's into me and not you.

48:52.330 --> 48:55.363
Don't make up these
bogus stories.

48:55.365 --> 48:57.566
Fine, whatever,
don't believe me.

48:57.568 --> 48:58.903
You'll find out.

49:07.711 --> 49:09.310
- Hey.
- Hi!

49:09.312 --> 49:10.812
I'm so glad you could come.

49:10.814 --> 49:13.381
I thought Dungeons & Dragons?

49:13.383 --> 49:15.484
Drinking and debauchery.

49:15.486 --> 49:17.720
- Oh.
- This is my friend Morgan.

49:17.722 --> 49:20.256
- This is Lisa.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

49:20.258 --> 49:22.223
I love this song,
let's go dance!

49:22.225 --> 49:23.424
No, no, no.

49:23.426 --> 49:26.761
Aw, here, will
you hold this drink?

49:56.260 --> 49:58.459
You know, I love
the guys at the shop,

49:58.461 --> 50:00.595
but this has been one
of the greatest evenings

50:00.597 --> 50:03.098
I've had in a long time.

50:03.100 --> 50:05.334
Well it doesn't
hurt to network, Lisa.

50:05.336 --> 50:08.671
They've been there for
me when no one else has.

50:08.673 --> 50:09.904
Is that common?

50:09.906 --> 50:13.741
People abandoning you
because you're gay?

50:13.743 --> 50:15.209
You lose a few.

50:15.211 --> 50:16.678
Some more than others.

50:16.680 --> 50:18.180
That's awful.

50:18.182 --> 50:20.716
Why can't people just let
other people be themselves?

50:20.718 --> 50:21.883
Well when you're net worth

50:21.885 --> 50:25.486
depends on being
normal and fitting in,

50:25.488 --> 50:28.390
going against the flow
just scares people.

50:28.392 --> 50:30.125
Sounds like my mom.

50:30.127 --> 50:31.959
Well, there just comes
a time in your life

50:31.961 --> 50:33.861
where you have to
be you for you.

50:33.863 --> 50:35.830
Screw what other people think.

50:35.832 --> 50:38.000
I wish I could
be more like you.

50:38.002 --> 50:40.435
No, you be more like you.

50:40.437 --> 50:43.171
You're amazing, and
you're pretty smart,

50:43.173 --> 50:44.341
and so pretty.

51:01.225 --> 51:02.758
Hey, Kevin, do
you hear that music?

51:02.760 --> 51:04.125
Yeah, where's it comin' from?

51:04.127 --> 51:05.493
I think it's
comin' from up here.

51:05.495 --> 51:07.428
Is that that Ian's Comics?

51:07.430 --> 51:09.598
Yeah, but why would
they be playing music?

51:09.600 --> 51:11.299
It's a comic book shop.

51:11.301 --> 51:12.834
I don't know.

51:12.836 --> 51:14.403
Maybe they have some kind
of party or rave going on.

51:14.405 --> 51:15.837
I don't know, you
wanna go check it out?

51:15.839 --> 51:17.573
Heck yeah, it's
our competition.

51:17.575 --> 51:19.577
- All right.
- All right.

51:21.444 --> 51:23.479
The hell kind
of store is this?

51:23.481 --> 51:26.515
It's like Studio 54
meets Clerks in here.

51:29.553 --> 51:32.254
Is there anything I
can help you guys with?

51:32.256 --> 51:33.555
Okay, look at this.

51:33.557 --> 51:34.890
These are the depths
they have to go to

51:34.892 --> 51:36.991
to get customers in the door?

51:36.993 --> 51:37.827
Really?

51:39.397 --> 51:42.296
Is there anything I
can help you boys with?

51:42.298 --> 51:44.133
Oh my God.

51:44.135 --> 51:45.533
Right this way.

51:45.535 --> 51:46.769
Yes, sir.

51:51.374 --> 51:52.908
Ashley?

51:52.910 --> 51:55.243
What the hell are
you doin' here?

51:55.245 --> 51:57.613
Strawberry daiquiri,
it's delicious.

51:57.615 --> 51:59.015
Do you want some?

52:00.350 --> 52:01.950
This is just ridiculous.

52:01.952 --> 52:03.551
Can you get the owner for me?

52:03.553 --> 52:05.421
Who, Ian, yeah,
I'll go get him.

52:10.493 --> 52:11.859
Ian Petrella?

52:11.861 --> 52:14.062
Randy from A Christmas Story?

52:14.064 --> 52:15.096
Mm hmm.

52:15.098 --> 52:17.165
Why, did you want an autograph?

52:17.167 --> 52:19.301
Because they're $20.

52:19.303 --> 52:21.336
No, I'm Kevin,
from A&A Comics.

52:21.338 --> 52:24.272
Oh, the little
eyesore down the road.

52:24.274 --> 52:26.008
Eyesore?

52:26.010 --> 52:27.375
So did you come here to see

52:27.377 --> 52:30.745
what a real comic
book store looks like?

52:30.747 --> 52:33.482
See, I'm a millionaire,

52:33.484 --> 52:34.982
and I will not be happy

52:34.984 --> 52:38.953
until I am the last comic
book store in Cleveland.

52:38.955 --> 52:40.790
That makes no sense.

52:41.992 --> 52:44.394
How dare you, Ian Petrella?

52:45.830 --> 52:48.997
May you and your comic
book store burn in hell.

52:48.999 --> 52:50.332
All right, come on, let's go.

52:50.334 --> 52:52.334
- This place sucks.
- All right, man.

52:52.336 --> 52:53.868
- All right, thank you.
- This place sucks.

52:53.870 --> 52:55.705
Let's go, gentlemen.

52:59.542 --> 53:01.910
Hey, I'm, I'm sorry
about the other night.

53:01.912 --> 53:03.111
It's okay.

53:03.113 --> 53:05.314
I really didn't
mean to scare you off.

53:05.316 --> 53:08.051
- Really, it's okay.
- All right.

53:12.356 --> 53:13.555
Did you know Jack Kirby

53:13.557 --> 53:16.792
would've been 96
years old today?

53:16.794 --> 53:18.426
What?

53:18.428 --> 53:19.660
Indeed.

53:19.662 --> 53:21.897
I imagine what the
world would've been like

53:21.899 --> 53:23.665
if Jack Kirby
didn't get cut down

53:23.667 --> 53:25.069
in the year 1994.

53:27.437 --> 53:29.006
My summer a blight.

53:30.106 --> 53:32.441
We would've had flying cars.

53:32.443 --> 53:33.941
Flying cars, Spence?

53:33.943 --> 53:35.378
Sure.

53:36.714 --> 53:38.013
Okay, just how
would the survival

53:38.015 --> 53:39.548
of a comic book
artist bring about

53:39.550 --> 53:42.084
flying cars, pray tell?

53:42.086 --> 53:43.852
Especially in the 20
years since he died,

53:43.854 --> 53:45.187
considering we didn't
get flying cars

53:45.189 --> 53:47.689
in the first 76
years of his life.

53:47.691 --> 53:50.091
Well, the Jetsons did manifest

53:50.093 --> 53:52.227
an early version of Kirby.

53:52.229 --> 53:54.263
His work would've
changed the world.

53:54.265 --> 53:57.165
We woulda had, you
know, automobiles,

53:57.167 --> 54:00.203
landscape, rocketry,
and flying cars.

54:04.107 --> 54:06.875
That makes, that
makes no sense.

54:06.877 --> 54:08.343
I mean, people have
been fantasizing

54:08.345 --> 54:09.912
about flying to
work for decades.

54:09.914 --> 54:11.145
It's not like they
just sat around

54:11.147 --> 54:13.482
and waited for Jack
Kirby to draw it.

54:13.484 --> 54:14.917
And, besides, if they
wanted inspiration,

54:14.919 --> 54:17.051
the Jetsons should've
inspired them,

54:17.053 --> 54:18.352
and none of that
changes the physics

54:18.354 --> 54:20.690
of trying to make a car fly.

54:23.260 --> 54:24.759
You know, Spence,
we would probably be

54:24.761 --> 54:28.629
$100,000 richer if you ever
bought anything at the store.

54:28.631 --> 54:31.533
I'm not gonna buy anything AK.

54:31.535 --> 54:32.968
AK?

54:32.970 --> 54:34.336
Yeah, AK.

54:34.338 --> 54:35.339
After Kirby.

54:37.575 --> 54:39.408
Well, we do try to
keep the store going,

54:39.410 --> 54:40.978
even in the AK era.

54:42.111 --> 54:44.011
Attention,
attention, everyone.

54:44.013 --> 54:46.682
As you may know, my
name's Kevin Murphy.

54:46.684 --> 54:49.517
And tonight we have a very
special lady in the house.

54:49.519 --> 54:52.787
She has came to mean
a lot to the store.

54:52.789 --> 54:54.455
And, actually, a lot to me.

54:54.457 --> 54:56.158
And I have a very special song

54:56.160 --> 54:58.326
for that very special lady.

54:58.328 --> 54:59.162
Carley.

56:05.129 --> 56:06.361
What do you think you're doing?

56:06.363 --> 56:07.495
Can't you see how
embarrassed she is?

56:07.497 --> 56:08.665
Are you blind?

56:10.434 --> 56:13.102
Why don't you back the hell off?

56:14.537 --> 56:16.571
I think both of you need
to give her some space.

56:16.573 --> 56:17.805
But I was just trying to...

56:17.807 --> 56:19.908
Nah, you were
trying to impress her,

56:19.910 --> 56:21.308
and you were trying
to defend her,

56:21.310 --> 56:24.111
and you both made asses
out of yourselves.

56:24.113 --> 56:25.781
You know what, I give up.

56:46.002 --> 56:47.004
- Hey.
- Hey.

56:49.673 --> 56:50.506
What's up?

56:53.743 --> 56:56.410
I just wanted to apologize

56:56.412 --> 56:58.580
for freaking out on you earlier.

56:58.582 --> 56:59.781
No.

56:59.783 --> 57:00.948
You're right, Lisa.

57:00.950 --> 57:02.584
I was so much in my own world

57:02.586 --> 57:03.919
that I didn't even
realize how uncomfortable

57:03.921 --> 57:06.620
I was makin' her feel
with the serenade.

57:06.622 --> 57:08.790
To put it mildly.

57:08.792 --> 57:12.593
But I just don't understand
why she reacted so strongly.

57:12.595 --> 57:15.497
Like, if you're not
into me like that,

57:15.499 --> 57:17.732
or whatever, then that's cool,

57:17.734 --> 57:20.035
but the way she reacted?

57:20.037 --> 57:22.703
Kevin, you should know,

57:22.705 --> 57:23.774
Carley's gay.

57:24.807 --> 57:25.941
Gay?

57:25.943 --> 57:27.042
Gay.

57:27.044 --> 57:28.142
Damn.

57:28.144 --> 57:30.044
- Mark was right.
- What?

57:30.046 --> 57:30.879
Nothing.

57:30.881 --> 57:32.580
So it's not personally?

57:32.582 --> 57:34.348
Of course not.

57:34.350 --> 57:35.850
You're a great guy.

57:35.852 --> 57:38.220
You won't be alone long.

57:38.222 --> 57:39.154
Thanks.

57:39.156 --> 57:41.589
You're awesome, Lisa.

57:41.591 --> 57:43.924
How 'bout we go out
together some time?

57:43.926 --> 57:45.595
- You and me?
- Yeah.

57:46.763 --> 57:49.730
I mean, we've known
each other for years,

57:49.732 --> 57:51.433
we like the same things,

57:51.435 --> 57:53.067
and I know,
throughout the years,

57:53.069 --> 57:55.504
that you had a little
bit of a crush on me.

57:55.506 --> 57:58.073
You're a great friend
and, and I love you

57:58.075 --> 58:00.107
- as a...
- As a friend,

58:00.109 --> 58:01.509
I know, I know.

58:01.511 --> 58:03.178
I'm such a great friend.

58:03.180 --> 58:04.546
I swear, if I had
a dollar every time

58:04.548 --> 58:05.781
I heard a girl say that,

58:05.783 --> 58:08.183
I'd be able to pay
me therapist bills.

58:08.185 --> 58:09.750
I mean, sometimes I
just wanna turn around

58:09.752 --> 58:11.019
when I hear someone say that

58:11.021 --> 58:12.953
and be like, okay,
screw you, bitch.

58:12.955 --> 58:15.089
You wanna go out?

58:15.091 --> 58:16.957
Next time I hear a girl say,

58:16.959 --> 58:18.593
where are all the good guys at?

58:18.595 --> 58:20.194
I'm going to reply,

58:20.196 --> 58:23.330
in the friend zone,
where you left them.

58:23.332 --> 58:25.399
It's not that simple.

58:25.401 --> 58:27.637
How isn't it that simple?

58:30.006 --> 58:33.408
I'm in love with someone else.

58:33.410 --> 58:34.912
You are?

58:36.580 --> 58:38.180
Yeah.

58:38.182 --> 58:39.814
Wow.

58:39.816 --> 58:41.448
Do they know?

58:41.450 --> 58:43.450
I don't know.

58:43.452 --> 58:45.953
Well, I think you
should go tell him.

58:45.955 --> 58:48.357
It, it's, it's complicated.

58:49.526 --> 58:51.859
Now you're
soundin' like Ash.

58:51.861 --> 58:52.695
Lisa.

58:53.664 --> 58:55.397
Yeah?

58:55.399 --> 58:56.497
Go.

58:56.499 --> 58:58.332
Tell them how you really feel.

58:58.334 --> 59:00.134
Don't miss the opportunity.

59:00.136 --> 59:02.537
If you want it bad, you
better go and get it.

59:02.539 --> 59:03.372
I will.

59:28.464 --> 59:29.997
Hey.

59:29.999 --> 59:30.833
Hey.

59:33.569 --> 59:34.870
Can I sit down.

59:34.872 --> 59:37.473
It's a free country.

59:40.711 --> 59:44.279
I'm sorry for how
I was acting earlier.

59:44.281 --> 59:46.013
You mean the freak
out you indulged in

59:46.015 --> 59:48.250
after Kevin's little
musical number?

59:48.252 --> 59:50.051
Yes, that.

59:50.053 --> 59:52.386
Well, I do appreciate how

59:52.388 --> 59:55.992
you rescued me, my
knight in shining armor.

59:57.160 --> 59:59.928
I didn't just come
over to apologize.

59:59.930 --> 01:00:01.431
Really?

01:00:02.531 --> 01:00:05.167
I came over
because I love you.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.038
You love me?

01:00:09.705 --> 01:00:11.171
I love you.

01:00:11.173 --> 01:00:12.439
I realize that now.

01:00:12.441 --> 01:00:14.174
I think part of me has
been in love with you

01:00:14.176 --> 01:00:16.645
since the first time we met.

01:00:16.647 --> 01:00:18.479
Oh, Lisa, I can't do this.

01:00:18.481 --> 01:00:20.515
But I thought after earlier?

01:00:20.517 --> 01:00:22.017
Yeah, after earlier,

01:00:22.019 --> 01:00:23.384
after I told you how I felt

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:25.754
and I got shut down.

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:29.323
It was just so easy for you to
push my feelings to the side.

01:00:29.325 --> 01:00:31.325
I know, and, and I'm sorry.

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:33.428
I don't know what
my problem was.

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:35.863
Yeah, it's a real mystery.

01:00:35.865 --> 01:00:38.933
But what if it comes back again?

01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:41.368
I feel for you, Lisa, I,

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:43.039
I'm falling for you,

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:46.774
but I can't take the
emotional yo-yoing.

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:48.843
Carley, I could
make this work.

01:00:48.845 --> 01:00:50.712
I want to make this work.

01:00:50.714 --> 01:00:51.979
What
about your parents?

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:55.685
Are you really ready to
jump off that bridge?

01:00:58.622 --> 01:00:59.455
Hi, Mom?

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:01.959
It's Lisa.

01:01:03.693 --> 01:01:04.527
Mom, I,

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:07.861
I have something I
need to tell you,

01:01:07.863 --> 01:01:10.564
and, and you may not like it,

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:13.302
but it's something
I have to say.

01:01:15.372 --> 01:01:16.671
Mom,

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:18.372
I finally figured out

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:20.841
why I've never found
a guy I wanted to date

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:23.979
or why none of the boys
you've ever introduced me to

01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:27.716
have ever interested
me in the slightest.

01:01:27.718 --> 01:01:30.785
I used to think it was
them, Mom, but it's not.

01:01:30.787 --> 01:01:31.620
It's me.

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:35.524
I'm gay, Mom.

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:39.259
I think part of me
has always known,

01:01:39.261 --> 01:01:42.765
but I didn't wanna
face it until now, and.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:44.698
But I'm gay,

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.035
and I'm in love.

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:50.205
I've met the most
amazing woman, Ma.

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:54.377
She's sweet, smart, kind,
and, and she cares about me.

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:58.479
And, and I wanna tell the world

01:01:58.481 --> 01:01:59.781
and I never wanna hide it,

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:03.551
so you would've
found out eventually.

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:06.223
I, I decided to tell you myself.

01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:10.392
I know that this isn't what
you envisioned for me, Mom,

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:11.560
but I'm happy,

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:14.828
I'm so happy when I'm with her,

01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:15.664
and,

01:02:16.999 --> 01:02:18.767
and if that's something
you can't accept,

01:02:18.769 --> 01:02:19.602
well,

01:02:21.203 --> 01:02:22.472
that's too bad.

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:26.709
I'll talk to you later.

01:02:29.745 --> 01:02:32.080
You told your mom.

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:32.915
Yeah.

01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:36.151
Wow.

01:02:36.153 --> 01:02:38.153
I thought you were
terrified of her.

01:02:38.155 --> 01:02:41.288
The thought of losing
you terrified me more.

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:44.125
Carley, I love you,
and if I had to climb

01:02:44.127 --> 01:02:45.894
to the top of the
water tower naked

01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:49.330
and yell it to the
world, I would.

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:51.533
Because when you discover

01:02:51.535 --> 01:02:53.368
that you wanna spend
the rest of your life

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:55.105
making someone happy,

01:02:56.006 --> 01:02:56.970
you want the rest of your life

01:02:56.972 --> 01:02:58.939
to start as soon as possible.

01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:00.876
I love you, too, Lisa.

01:03:11.321 --> 01:03:12.322
- Lisa.
- Yeah?

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:14.823
The conversation with your mom

01:03:14.825 --> 01:03:16.591
sounded awfully one-sided.

01:03:16.593 --> 01:03:18.361
Did she say anything?

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:21.595
She wasn't home.

01:03:21.597 --> 01:03:23.932
I got her voicemail.

01:03:23.934 --> 01:03:25.966
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:28.602
That would be one
awkward listening session.

01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:30.738
She usually checks
her messages in church

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:31.906
when it gets boring.

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:36.545
That oughta liven
up the sermon.

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:46.620
Have you ever had
sex with a physicist?

01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:48.455
Can't
say that I have.

01:03:48.457 --> 01:03:50.725
- I have one word for you.
- Yes?

01:03:50.727 --> 01:03:53.730
Leverage, my good
woman, leverage.

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:00.468
You guys, what
are we going to do

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:02.803
about this Ian
Petrella situation?

01:04:02.805 --> 01:04:03.738
Nothing.

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.973
I think his store is fantastic.

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:07.508
Just because you got
yourself a boy toy out of it

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:10.511
doesn't mean we can let
Kevin's store bite the dust.

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:12.113
Yeah, man, guy's
a millionaire.

01:04:12.115 --> 01:04:14.618
He can run us out of business.

01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:17.317
You know what?

01:04:17.319 --> 01:04:18.586
Don't worry about it.

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:21.355
I have an idea, I'll
take care of this.

01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:22.823
What are you gonna do,

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:26.095
accuse those bikini sluts
of devirginizing you?

01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:30.531
Yeah, man,
what are you gonna do?

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:32.834
The less you know, the better.

01:04:32.836 --> 01:04:34.935
Plausible deniability,
my friends.

01:04:34.937 --> 01:04:36.772
Plausible deniability.

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:50.019
Oh, hey, Kev, what's up?

01:04:50.921 --> 01:04:52.587
We need to talk.

01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:54.488
Yeah, I think we do.

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:56.790
So you're only
into girls, huh?

01:04:56.792 --> 01:04:59.761
Yeah, are you okay with that?

01:04:59.763 --> 01:05:01.629
Guess I have to be, right?

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:02.863
Some people have a hard time

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:05.232
being around gay people.

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:07.167
If you've seen some of the
people that came in here,

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:09.504
they make Freddie
Mercury look butch.

01:05:09.506 --> 01:05:10.805
If I can be cool with them,

01:05:10.807 --> 01:05:12.740
- I'll be cool with you.
- Good.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:15.375
'Cause I like you,
Kevin, I really do.

01:05:15.377 --> 01:05:18.446
I mean, probably not
how you were hoping,

01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:19.716
but I like you.

01:05:21.283 --> 01:05:23.718
I was waiting for
the right time.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:26.154
I just, I didn't wanna
ruin our friendship.

01:05:26.156 --> 01:05:28.055
Yeah, but it was
kinda my fault, too.

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:29.490
I was so puppy dog all over ya,

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:33.627
I didn't even give you the
right time to take advantage of.

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:36.465
Well, does that
mean I can stay?

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.904
You could be a convicted
felon and you could still stay.

01:05:42.906 --> 01:05:44.238
You're awesome.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.308
- I'd be an idiot to fire you.
- Good.

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.045
Oh no, that won't do.

01:05:51.214 --> 01:05:52.782
- Thank you.
- Mm hmm.

01:05:54.517 --> 01:05:56.850
I didn't do it,
I didn't do it.

01:05:56.852 --> 01:05:58.086
I didn't do it.

01:05:58.088 --> 01:05:59.787
What are you
babblin' on about?

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:01.055
Dude, didn't you hear?

01:06:01.057 --> 01:06:04.292
Ian's Comics burnt to
the ground last night.

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:07.995
Well, on that note,
see you guys later.

01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:09.596
Wait, what?

01:06:09.598 --> 01:06:11.531
The whole place is gone, man!

01:06:11.533 --> 01:06:12.767
Demolished!

01:06:12.769 --> 01:06:14.102
What'd you do?

01:06:14.104 --> 01:06:15.569
Nothing!

01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:17.904
I, I went over there to
silly string their windows,

01:06:17.906 --> 01:06:20.408
and when I got there, the
whole place was ablaze.

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:21.642
Wait a minute.

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:24.212
That's it, that was
your big master plan?

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:25.513
The thing I couldn't
be a part of

01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:28.549
because of plausible
deniability?

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:30.951
Dude, they saw
you in that store

01:06:30.953 --> 01:06:32.953
telling him to go burn in hell.

01:06:32.955 --> 01:06:34.788
They're gonna think we did it.

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:36.491
And, unlike Todd, I
don't think you and I

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:39.227
are gonna do very
well in prison.

01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:40.828
All right, all right,
hold on, hold on.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.062
We need to come
up with an alibi.

01:06:42.064 --> 01:06:43.131
We need to come
up with an alibi.

01:06:43.133 --> 01:06:45.933
Uh, where was I last night?

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:47.901
Cool your jets, ladies.

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:49.671
I spoke to Stanley this morning.

01:06:49.673 --> 01:06:51.906
You know, my new boy toy?

01:06:51.908 --> 01:06:53.308
His name is Stanley.

01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:54.709
Well, anyways, he
said it was due

01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:56.743
to a big electrical fire.

01:06:56.745 --> 01:06:57.979
Everything went up in flames

01:06:57.981 --> 01:06:59.479
because all the
lasers and lights

01:06:59.481 --> 01:07:01.316
they had going on there.

01:07:01.318 --> 01:07:03.984
So the evil reign
of Ian's Comics

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:04.988
is now over.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.089
And here I was

01:07:08.091 --> 01:07:10.625
thinkin' that we were
gonna go to jail.

01:07:10.627 --> 01:07:13.761
Yeah, it really makes
ya think, doesn't it?

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:15.830
Yeah, just to think,

01:07:15.832 --> 01:07:19.566
one minute, anything
can go up in smoke.

01:07:19.568 --> 01:07:21.169
No pun intended.

01:07:21.171 --> 01:07:23.705
Makes you really wanna
be able to say things

01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:25.038
that you've always
wanted to say,

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.542
and do things that you
always wanted to do.

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:31.212
Especially to people that
you really care about.

01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:32.379
You guys, watch the store.

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:34.717
I gotta go do some thinking.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:59.733
I let myself in with a key.

01:08:59.734 --> 01:09:01.368
What do you want?

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:04.872
Ash, I'm not ready
to give up on us yet.

01:09:06.176 --> 01:09:08.509
Kevin, we've been
through this before.

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:09.977
I know, I know,

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.380
but you know there's no
real scientific explanation

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:14.551
for us not to be together.

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:18.287
I know.

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:20.389
Ash, listen.

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:24.192
Ever since the first
time I met you,

01:09:24.194 --> 01:09:25.194
and saw you,

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:28.295
I knew I had to have you.

01:09:28.296 --> 01:09:30.729
And after being
together for so long,

01:09:30.732 --> 01:09:32.233
and knowin' so much about you,

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:36.170
like how you love country
music when you're alone,

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:38.371
how
you actually think

01:09:38.372 --> 01:09:40.340
people don't smell the
marijuana on your shirt

01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:42.844
after you're done smoking,

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:46.412
and how protective you
are with all your friends.

01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:50.518
And everybody just
wants you to be happy.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.853
And the only time that
you were actually happy

01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:55.355
was when we were together.

01:09:55.357 --> 01:09:56.693
I love you, Ash.

01:09:58.127 --> 01:10:01.629
And I just wanna spend the
rest of our lives together.

01:10:01.631 --> 01:10:02.899
What do ya say?

01:13:40.615 --> 01:13:42.049
All right, dude,
just tell me already.

01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:44.885
Are you and Ashley getting
back together again?

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:48.221
It just sucks not
to know, come on.

01:13:48.223 --> 01:13:50.325
Oh God, this guy again.

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:53.693
Now I told you once,

01:13:53.695 --> 01:13:55.196
and I'm gonna tell you again,

01:13:55.198 --> 01:13:57.130
that I will not rest

01:13:57.132 --> 01:13:59.567
until I am the last
comic book store

01:13:59.569 --> 01:14:02.335
standing in Cleveland, Ohio.

01:14:02.337 --> 01:14:04.138
You do know how
insane you sound, right?

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:04.973
Yes.

01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:16.586
Who the hell was that?

01:14:16.588 --> 01:14:20.226
