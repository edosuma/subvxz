[man] He's killing everybody, man!

[reporter] <i>And for more on the story we
go to our correspondent, Megan McLaren,</i>

02:15.176 --> 02:17.262
<i>in Harlem, live. Megan.</i>

02:17.345 --> 02:20.265
<i>Thanks, Tim. Local
residents are still stunned</i>

02:20.348 --> 02:22.183
<i>by the loss of Henry Hunter,</i>

02:22.267 --> 02:25.270
<i>or Pop, as he was known in
this Harlem neighborhood.</i>

02:25.353 --> 02:29.232
<i>Pop's Barber Shop was a
gathering place for everyone</i>

02:29.315 --> 02:32.027
<i>from local kids to
well-known celebrities.</i>

02:32.110 --> 02:35.113
<i>But now, it's become something
all too familiar in Harlem...</i>

02:36.740 --> 02:37.991
<i>a crime scene.</i>

02:39.325 --> 02:43.121
<i>Unknown assailants fired into the
shop just after 9:00 last night,</i>

02:43.204 --> 02:44.540
<i>killing Mr. Hunter.</i>

02:44.623 --> 02:49.210
<i>Wilfredo Diaz, an employee,
was also critically wounded.</i>

02:49.294 --> 02:51.880
<i>This shooting comes just
days after rising tension</i>

02:51.963 --> 02:53.924
<i>between black and Latino street gangs</i>

02:54.007 --> 02:57.093

02:58.094 --> 03:00.889
<i>Some residents fear the
recent uptick in gunfire</i>

03:00.972 --> 03:04.434
<i>may mar what many have referred

03:05.936 --> 03:08.897
<i>It's clear this
neighborhood will mourn the loss of a man</i>

03:08.980 --> 03:13.068
<i>whose calm, humorous
voice made many days brighter.</i>

03:13.151 --> 03:15.195
[indistinct conversations]

03:42.347 --> 03:43.599
Forward...

03:44.766 --> 03:46.017
always.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.296
[man in English] Yeah, that's
it. Let's get outta here.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.434
[conversing indistinctly]

04:29.895 --> 04:31.897
[Misty] Well, check with those people.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.124
- They talking?
- [Scarfe] Nah.

04:33.148 --> 04:36.317
"I ain't see shit." It's
the catchphrase of the day.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.905
Classic. I should get that
trademarked. You know how many times I hear that?

04:39.988 --> 04:43.158
- Nah. I can't hear shit either.
- [chuckles]

04:43.241 --> 04:46.912
- The hits looked precise.
- Oh, they knew what they were doing.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.289
Uh, victims said the
assailants were Spanish-speaking.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.125
Are the victims a part
of Cottonmouth's crew?

04:52.208 --> 04:55.420
Who knows? Computer's down. We
can run it back at the station.

04:55.503 --> 04:58.006
Or get a first-person ID.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.689
What do you say? You like hospital food?

04:59.716 --> 05:02.427
- [scoffs] Who's driving?
- Shoot for it.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.682
- You driving.
- Yes, Miss Daisy.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.351
[Luke] <i>Gold inlay on a mahogany casket?</i>

05:11.227 --> 05:13.772
[sighs] I appreciate
the sentiment. I do.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.399
But... it's a bit much.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.694
Well, um, we do have more...

05:19.319 --> 05:21.029
affordable options.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.866
Can I see the body?

05:24.950 --> 05:27.368
I'm sorry. That body just
arrived from the morgue.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.495
It still has to be prepped for viewing.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.957
[sighs]

05:32.040 --> 05:34.793
Look, Mr. Hunter...

05:34.876 --> 05:36.336
- Pop...
- Mmm.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.254
...was like a father to me.

05:39.214 --> 05:43.844
He's my wife's
people... and she's gone now, too.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.972
It's just me. I'm all he has.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.892
I just want to make
sure he's taken care of...

05:50.976 --> 05:52.643
until I can get the
cash to pay for this.

05:52.728 --> 05:54.395
Don't worry about it now, brother.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.315
It's already taken care of.

05:58.775 --> 06:02.112
Flourish is a silent way of us
treasuring the dearly departed.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.447
[breathes deeply]

06:04.530 --> 06:06.300
It's too bad you're not
in a position to give Pop

06:06.324 --> 06:07.993
the grand homegoing he deserves.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.954
The service should
match the man's integrity.

06:12.413 --> 06:13.706
Hmm.

06:15.208 --> 06:19.129
- Can we have the room, Joel?
- Uh, no problem, Mr. Stokes.

06:28.554 --> 06:31.307
Me and Henry didn't see eye to eye.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.686
But I always had his back.

06:37.272 --> 06:40.566
He wouldn't want any
drama. Especially here.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.419
What Pop would have
wanted is for you not to pay

06:42.443 --> 06:45.030
for his arrangements with
bloody guilt money.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.158
We set a parley.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.701
- I thought your word was bond.
- It is.

06:52.287 --> 06:55.373
A former associate of
mine was feelin' himself.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.669
He's not feelin' much
of anything right now.

06:59.752 --> 07:03.131
Doesn't matter. Pop's
death is still on you.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.715
Step off.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.009
Before you get hurt.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.054
Why?

07:09.137 --> 07:10.513
I'm just getting started.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.932
[laughing]

07:13.516 --> 07:16.019
Good to know. Hmm.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.104
How's the job search coming?

07:20.315 --> 07:22.108
- Dishwasher.
- [pats Luke]

07:31.159 --> 07:32.618
[bell chimes]

08:09.572 --> 08:11.157
I saw you standing out there earlier.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.079
I wasn't ready to come in yet.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.622
[Fish] Yeah, I hear you on that.

08:18.874 --> 08:22.043
Walking in this shop is the
hardest thing I've ever done.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.423
[sighing] Yeah.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.718
I mean, who's ever really ready to
see something like this, though?

08:45.441 --> 08:47.318
[sighs]

08:52.573 --> 08:53.867
How'd you know Pop?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.745
We used to play chess
in Marcus Garvey Park.

08:58.496 --> 09:01.291
He got too busy to play,
so I started coming here.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.670
When you played him... who would win?

09:05.753 --> 09:06.796
Me.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.590
[chuckles]

09:09.674 --> 09:10.734
Just 'cause the brother's dead

09:10.758 --> 09:12.479
don't mean I gotta
start changing the facts.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.012
[both chuckle]

09:16.973 --> 09:18.224
[sighs]

09:21.519 --> 09:22.879
So what will happen to this place?

09:22.938 --> 09:25.815
Ah, the bank will swoop
in and take it eventually.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.401
How do you know that?

09:29.194 --> 09:33.698
Besides playing chess, I used
to do the man's taxes every year.

09:33.781 --> 09:36.534
I know where every account
is and who's owed what.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.164
Trust me, soon as the word
spreads that he's gone,

09:41.247 --> 09:44.042
the wolves will be at the door.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.088
- Not on my watch.
- [scoffs] You got 80 grand lying around?

09:48.171 --> 09:51.132
'Cause that's what it's gonna
take to keep this place open.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.010
So it's too late.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.721
Not necessarily.

09:56.804 --> 10:00.433
Eighty grand isn't just gonna
come fallin' out of the sky.

10:00.516 --> 10:03.186
What should we do? Talk to the bank?

10:03.269 --> 10:05.939
Well, we have a little time.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.334
No one's gonna be asking
questions and shutting things down

10:08.358 --> 10:10.610
as long as things are paid for on time.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.114
Why do you think so many
people get Grandma's house

10:14.197 --> 10:17.993
without having to fill out
extra paperwork or hire a lawyer?

10:19.160 --> 10:22.247
You pay the bills, people
shut up and get on with things.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.502
So what you thinkin' now?

10:29.462 --> 10:32.590
As much I'd like to put my
foot in Cottonmouth's behind,

10:32.673 --> 10:34.509
I need to put my hands in his pockets.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.070
That's how you hurt someone like that.

10:36.094 --> 10:39.847
Robbin' Cottonmouth was what caused
all this trouble in the first place.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.517
[exhales deeply]

10:46.312 --> 10:47.855
You're absolutely right.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.733
I'm not gonna touch him.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.236
Not the way I should.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.157
Since I can't touch the king,

10:57.240 --> 11:00.118
I'm gonna take his queen, his knights...

11:01.369 --> 11:02.453
his rooks...

11:04.914 --> 11:06.749
I'm knocking all his
pieces off the board.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.669
Where you goin' now?

11:11.171 --> 11:12.797
Check these fools.

11:18.886 --> 11:22.140
Three friends. Grade school tight.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.225
Playground tight.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.478
All-City in basketball in a
town where that really matters.

11:27.562 --> 11:30.148
So what happens?

11:30.231 --> 11:32.024
Y'all don't go pro.

11:32.108 --> 11:35.486
One of you... starts
working for Cottonmouth...

11:36.071 --> 11:38.323
makes some money, sees
a slick opportunity,

11:38.406 --> 11:39.949
and you guys go for it.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.413
You were part of the heist, right?

11:45.496 --> 11:49.834
And the shootout at the barber
shop was payback for the heist.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.711
So, what happened to your man Dante?

11:54.547 --> 11:56.632
Shameek killed Dante.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.095
You admit to that?

12:01.929 --> 12:02.930
I admit what?

12:03.013 --> 12:07.310
I mean, I was assuming Shameek
did it. 'Cause I know I didn't.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.769
Never assume anything, kiddo.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.231
Too bad your boys aren't
here to back up your story.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.817
Maybe he's telling the truth.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.737
Let's say he is.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.489
Shameek sees all that cash and says,

12:19.572 --> 12:22.617
"Oh, shit, there's no way I'm
splitting that three ways." So...

12:22.700 --> 12:23.868
- Boom!
- [gun fires]

12:24.702 --> 12:27.163
Now it's a two-way
split instead of three.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.124
Shameek gets caught with
his share of the cash.

12:29.207 --> 12:32.335
- By Cottonmouth, I'm assuming.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:34.504 --> 12:35.505
Who?

12:36.256 --> 12:37.923
[both chuckle]

12:38.007 --> 12:40.635
- "Who?"
- Cottonmouth.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.803
The man you stole from.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.054
Dante's former boss.

12:44.139 --> 12:47.683
The man who shot up Pop's Barber Shop

12:47.767 --> 12:51.271
and killed a good
man trying to get at you.

12:54.106 --> 12:58.653
Hey, look, we don't want you, Chico.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.121
We want the people who killed

13:01.146 --> 13:04.599
Shameek and who shot
up the barber shop.

13:05.576 --> 13:06.827
Testify.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.248
Do something good for somebody for once.

13:15.378 --> 13:18.381
[breathing shakily] I
can't help you with that.

13:23.178 --> 13:25.596
Hey, look, can y'all
please take off these handcuffs?

13:25.680 --> 13:28.183
I'm the victim here. Me.

13:28.266 --> 13:31.686
Talk to us. Talk to a grand jury.

13:31.769 --> 13:35.356
You can save lives, Wilfredo.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.900
Step up.

13:43.864 --> 13:44.865
[grunts]

13:47.952 --> 13:49.745
Well, the streets will handle it.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.582
Just like they always do.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.375
[exhales deeply]

13:58.504 --> 13:59.714
[Chico breathing heavily]

14:02.425 --> 14:03.676
[gasps]

14:05.595 --> 14:07.096
Yeah, they will.

14:26.782 --> 14:28.117
What are you doing?

14:31.287 --> 14:32.705
[Scarfe] Letting you go.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.207
Like you said...

14:35.833 --> 14:37.460
you're the victim...

14:37.543 --> 14:39.879
not a suspect, right?

14:40.630 --> 14:41.839
So, go.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.008
Wherever.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.595
You got no clothes, you got no money.

14:47.678 --> 14:50.348
And your friends are gonna be
looking to finish the job, right?

14:51.432 --> 14:53.309
But you're a man.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.646
You're gonna be just fine, Chico.

14:58.105 --> 15:01.401
Chico is the man.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.073
Pop was a friend.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.828
- He deserves the best.
- Yeah.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.456
I see you've been busy.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.588
What about this man right here?

15:25.049 --> 15:26.426
[Stokes] Tone?

15:29.094 --> 15:30.471
I had to let him go.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.558
Nothing humbles a man like gravity.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.518
Hmm.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.895
Remember...

15:38.896 --> 15:40.815
same as always.

15:40.898 --> 15:42.525
This body can't exist.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.783
- What body?
- [chuckles]

15:52.117 --> 15:54.119
- My man.
- [grunts]

16:01.085 --> 16:03.588
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

16:07.800 --> 16:09.051
[chuckles]

16:10.803 --> 16:13.097
And there's the bartender.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.265
Luke Cage.

16:16.225 --> 16:19.437
Right in the center...
of the nightclub...

16:19.520 --> 16:21.814
of the barber shop...

16:21.897 --> 16:23.441
of everything.

16:24.442 --> 16:27.528
- Where you going?
- To see a friend.

16:27.612 --> 16:28.904
Mmm-mmm.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.868
Woman, what's your
problem? I've done nothing.

16:33.951 --> 16:37.079
There's only one person who
worked for both Pop and Cottonmouth,

16:37.162 --> 16:38.831
and that's you.

16:38.914 --> 16:40.207
In the past 72 hours,

16:40.290 --> 16:43.919
three people connected are
dead. Shameek, Dante and Pop.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.964
And there was another shooting this
morning tied to all of this.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.167
Would you call that nothing?

16:48.215 --> 16:49.592
And all that's on me?

16:51.135 --> 16:54.096
Why don't y'all find Pop's killer instead
of being all up in my business?

16:54.179 --> 16:58.476
Your business and our
investigation are one and the same.

17:04.272 --> 17:05.858
You know where I live.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.571
You wanna work some things out, hmm?

17:12.781 --> 17:14.534
We can always do it there.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.869
You can even bring handcuffs this time.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.799
[Scarfe sighs]

17:29.882 --> 17:30.883
[Misty sighs]

17:32.259 --> 17:33.499
[Luke] <i>You don't have to worry.</i>

17:33.928 --> 17:35.471
Cottonmouth ain't trying to kill you.

17:35.555 --> 17:39.475
[scoffs] Are you kidding? Were
you at the same shootout as I was?

17:39.559 --> 17:41.143
It was his boy, Tone.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.937
Tone acted on his own.

17:43.020 --> 17:46.190
And... he died on his own, too.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.233
He's cleanin' up and I
ain't trying to be next.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.654
Cottonmouth has his cash.
That's all he cares about.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.449
Hell, you right about that.

17:54.532 --> 17:57.535
Doesn't matter how many
people had to die to get it, huh?

17:57.618 --> 17:59.178
Wasn't like the money fell in your lap.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.081
Your hands have blood all over them.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.333
That don't matter. I'm out.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.588
- I've caused enough trouble.
- More than enough.

18:08.671 --> 18:11.757
Pop signed his death warrant the
minute he decided to help you.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.523
Well, it's the other
way around, ain't it?

18:15.260 --> 18:18.263
The bullet that killed
Pops probably bounced off you.

18:20.558 --> 18:21.934
You're one of them, ain't you?

18:24.269 --> 18:26.313
You don't know nothin'.

18:26.396 --> 18:28.232
I know this isn't my fault.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.487
Parley or no parley, this
is on Cottonmouth.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.576
[inhales deeply] So help me hurt him.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.167
What do you want?

18:48.210 --> 18:50.420
Before you guys decided to rob him...

18:51.464 --> 18:54.383
how much did Dante tell you about
Cottonmouth's operations?

18:55.843 --> 18:57.011
Everything.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.263
Cottonmouth sells guns.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.891
Mariah, his cousin, runs the banks.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.977
- Where does all that money go?
- Everywhere you could think.

19:05.060 --> 19:08.939
They got drops and stash
houses across the city.

19:09.023 --> 19:13.110
Apartments, sham
businesses, street pushers.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.029
I mean, they got it locked in.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.072
Is there a final spot?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.323
A central bank?

19:21.326 --> 19:23.538
[Chico] <i>They got a
plan if shit goes down.</i>

19:24.997 --> 19:27.332
<i>Everything goes to Crispus Attucks.</i>

19:29.043 --> 19:32.462
<i>I even heard they got this
locked room, like a vault,</i>

19:32.547 --> 19:34.882
<i>right in the middle of the whole joint.</i>

19:37.760 --> 19:41.681
So why rob a gun shipment if it
was all just about a cash grab?

19:43.599 --> 19:45.976
[scoffs] Are you crazy?

19:48.020 --> 19:50.523
Man, Crispus Attucks is like a fortress.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.776
I mean, they got concrete walls,

19:53.859 --> 19:57.029
cats with machine guns,
machetes, dark hallways...

19:57.112 --> 19:59.949
One entrance, one exit.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.827
[stutters] It's like
a beehive of misery.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.245
That place is a suicide
mission, for real.

20:08.373 --> 20:11.586
Did Dante tell you where any
of these other stash houses are?

20:13.128 --> 20:16.215
Yeah. I mean, yeah, we scoped a few out.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.552
There was a shooting this morning.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.596
A couple of Cottonmouth's
people got hit.

20:21.679 --> 20:24.431
Yeah. I mean, the cops
got the guns at the heist.

20:24.514 --> 20:27.059
And my guess is that's Domingo and them,

20:27.142 --> 20:30.062
hollering at Cottonmouth to
let him know they ain't happy.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.273
If they hit him a few more times...

20:33.357 --> 20:36.819
Cottonmouth might just have to move
everything to Crispus to keep it safe.

20:38.863 --> 20:42.032
[scoffs] You gonna try to
convince Domingo to hit 'em up?

20:42.950 --> 20:44.076
No.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.454
I don't need Domingo to be Domingo.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.959
I can do that all by myself.

20:52.906 --> 20:54.938
<i>- [man] All right, sound check.
- [soul music playing]</i>

20:54.962 --> 20:56.714
<i>Let's hit it.</i>

20:56.797 --> 20:58.799
[Charles Bradley singing]

21:34.001 --> 21:36.170
- [door opens forcefully]
- Oh, shit.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.838
[men grunting]

22:01.862 --> 22:03.488
[Luke grunts]

22:35.437 --> 22:38.107
- [officer 1] You see this?
- [officer 2] Yeah. Why leave the cash?

23:08.929 --> 23:10.973
[clattering]

23:14.268 --> 23:15.644
[glass shattering]

23:27.697 --> 23:30.450
- [clattering]
- [glass shattering]

23:39.043 --> 23:40.169
[Misty] Hey.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.837
[woman speaking indistinctly on radio]

23:42.629 --> 23:43.672
Hey...

23:44.256 --> 23:45.465
you okay?

23:46.842 --> 23:48.427
What the hell happened here?

23:49.929 --> 23:53.432
Some dude in a hoodie rolled through.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.600
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:56.768 --> 24:00.064
"Rolled through"? Did you see his face?

24:01.648 --> 24:02.649
Hey...

24:03.317 --> 24:05.194
what can you tell me about him?

24:08.823 --> 24:10.574
He was fine.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.744
[scoffs]

24:17.915 --> 24:20.709
What do you mean everything is fine?

24:20.792 --> 24:22.336
Like I said, it's fine.

24:23.087 --> 24:27.216
You've got welders reinforcing doors
to rooms I don't even go into.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.383
What are they doing?

24:29.343 --> 24:31.595
We got hit today. We
need to take precautions.

24:31.678 --> 24:35.599
Get the bars down. Place looks
like a goddamn prison now.

24:35.682 --> 24:37.726
And what do you mean "we"?

24:37.809 --> 24:41.396
- You got hit again this morning?
- Four of my stash houses were hit today.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.108
Fort Knox is my contingency plan.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.318
It's always been the
plan if shit goes down.

24:46.401 --> 24:49.196
That is not a plan. That's a reaction.

24:49.279 --> 24:52.074
You ever hear of not
putting all your eggs in one basket?

24:52.157 --> 24:53.617
Look at it.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.702
One way in, one way out.

24:55.785 --> 24:58.330
Sight lines as far as the eye can see.

24:58.413 --> 25:01.458
Ain't nobody goin' up in the
projects. We got that shit on lockdown.

25:01.541 --> 25:04.253
They are not projects. It's
going to be a community

25:04.336 --> 25:07.297
as soon as I get the rest of the
funding and we start our construction.

25:07.381 --> 25:09.758
[laughing]

25:09.841 --> 25:11.718
That's just spin.

25:11.801 --> 25:15.222
It's a front, Mariah. It's
always been a front.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.099
It's real.

25:17.182 --> 25:20.477
This affordable housing initiative
is going to change things, man.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.105
Let me worry about the street shit.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.690
- You're just the laundromat for the money.
- Uh, no, I'm not.

25:25.774 --> 25:28.277
I'm the face on the money.

25:29.319 --> 25:31.363
So what's that make me? Loose change?

25:31.446 --> 25:33.615
You are a strong asset,

25:33.698 --> 25:37.494
whose reckless
actions are often a liability.

25:39.829 --> 25:42.041
Crispus Attucks is real, Cornell.

25:42.124 --> 25:44.543
Nothing I do is a hustle.

25:45.460 --> 25:49.256
I sincerely care about
what happens up here.

25:49.339 --> 25:52.676
The only way to save
Harlem is to do it legally...

25:53.302 --> 25:55.512
and fortify it against
the real invaders.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.472
[laughs] Whatever.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.476
It's the same as it always
was, and you know it.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.228
Keep livin' in that fantasy land.

26:03.312 --> 26:06.815
Well, it has got to be a
fantasy before it become a reality.

26:08.943 --> 26:10.652
I mean, look around.

26:10.735 --> 26:13.948
Mama Mabel loved this place.

26:15.115 --> 26:18.827
It was her political connections got
that jungle gym over there built.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.414
[laughs] We doin' this for jungle gyms?

26:23.873 --> 26:25.960
Those political connections

26:26.043 --> 26:30.422
were just freaky old men she blackmailed
to push the paperwork through.

26:30.505 --> 26:32.799
Why do you think she
blackmailed those politicians?

26:32.882 --> 26:36.428
It was all to serve a greater good.

26:36.511 --> 26:38.180
Have you forgotten that?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.101
No.

26:45.687 --> 26:48.523
This building may be
your bank right now.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.526
But the Crispus
Attucks, Madam C.J. Walker,

26:51.610 --> 26:55.030
Adam Clayton Powell, Shirley
Chisholm complexes

26:55.114 --> 26:58.408
will be vibrant
communities reflecting the change

26:58.492 --> 27:01.996
that's gonna keep Harlem
black and us in the green.

27:02.079 --> 27:05.749
You focus on the
black, I'll protect our green.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.253
Fort Knox is central to that.

27:09.794 --> 27:10.962
Just need to be ready.

27:12.756 --> 27:14.383
I stay ready, baby.

27:37.447 --> 27:39.991
How you doing, Ms.
Mariah? Good to see you.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.374
[Scarfe] <i>Oh, it's gonna work.</i>

27:47.457 --> 27:51.086
See, that's the thing about
a dude like Chico.

27:52.421 --> 27:53.422
Trick is...

27:53.505 --> 27:56.550
you gotta get inside his head. Uh-huh.

27:56.633 --> 28:00.345
You gotta make him
believe that he needs us.

28:00.429 --> 28:02.472
That's the whole trick.

28:02.556 --> 28:06.476
And then... you give him
the illusion of freedom.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.104
Hey.

28:10.605 --> 28:12.149
You didn't hear a word I just said.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.360
I'm sorry.

28:15.444 --> 28:18.405
- I can't stop thinking about Pop.
- Hmm.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.533
You knew him forever, huh?

28:21.616 --> 28:23.702
Since I was nine.

28:23.785 --> 28:25.620
He was the reason I played basketball.

28:25.704 --> 28:29.541
- He was your coach?
- No. I never saw him outside the shop.

28:29.624 --> 28:32.461
My dad used to drag me with him when
he went to go get his hair cut.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.214
- Daddy's girl.
- Always.

28:35.297 --> 28:38.592
They would sit around all the
time and just argue about basketball.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.844
Larry Bird. Kevin McHale.

28:40.927 --> 28:43.055
- Robert Parish...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

28:43.138 --> 28:44.139
Celtics?

28:45.140 --> 28:48.685
My dad is a Celtics fan.

28:48.768 --> 28:52.021
Please, please tell
me that's not the case.

28:52.106 --> 28:54.608
- The most progressive team in NBA history.
- The Celtics?

28:54.691 --> 28:57.944
The first black head
coach with Bill Russell.

28:58.027 --> 29:00.530
K.C. Jones as head coach during
the height of the '80s

29:00.614 --> 29:02.449
with Bird and McHale. Come on.

29:02.532 --> 29:04.409
Now I got it all figured out.

29:04.493 --> 29:05.660
See...

29:05.744 --> 29:08.247
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend

29:08.330 --> 29:09.789
because you love the brothers,

29:09.873 --> 29:11.267
and not many brothers
can get with a girl

29:11.291 --> 29:14.253
who carry a gun and kick their
ass. But that's not the reason.

29:14.336 --> 29:16.755
- Oh, so now you an expert?
- The reason is...

29:16.838 --> 29:19.299
you're a Celtics fan living
in New York City. [chuckles]

29:20.384 --> 29:21.468
I like the Pistons.

29:21.551 --> 29:22.927
- Oh, shit!
- [laughs]

29:24.053 --> 29:27.474
I would hear Pop and my dad argue
so much about basketball,

29:27.557 --> 29:28.850
it made me wanna play.

29:29.393 --> 29:30.644
So I did.

29:30.727 --> 29:34.439
Pop would complain about
players who couldn't go left or right,

29:34.523 --> 29:36.691
or box out, or hustle back on D.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.360
So, I did.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.445
Sounds like he taught you well.

29:41.696 --> 29:44.116
I was playing college
ball before I realized

29:44.199 --> 29:47.619
how much watching games at the
shop and those arguments shaped me.

29:47.702 --> 29:50.580
[sighs] A lot of people loved this guy.

29:50.664 --> 29:54.543
Even when it was
wild during the summers...

29:54.626 --> 29:58.338
shootouts every other
day... the shop was safe.

29:59.381 --> 30:01.508
Nobody ever said anything.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.385
It just was.

30:03.468 --> 30:04.719
Always.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.889
Until...

30:07.972 --> 30:11.268
- Until what?
- Until Luke Cage started workin' there.

30:15.230 --> 30:17.149
You got a real problem with this guy.

30:18.400 --> 30:22.696
Well, maybe, you shouldn't have jumped
in the sack with him so quickly.

30:23.572 --> 30:26.074
- [scoffs]
- [chuckles]

30:26.991 --> 30:28.034
How soon did it happen?

30:28.910 --> 30:31.471
A couple days after you were
undercover at the Harlem's Paradise?

30:34.123 --> 30:35.667
Same night.

30:35.750 --> 30:38.212
[chuckles] Damn, girl!

30:38.295 --> 30:40.505
[chuckles] His place or yours?

30:40.589 --> 30:41.840
Shut up.

30:43.007 --> 30:47.262
Look, I'm telling you, there is
just something about this dude.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.888
- I can't put my finger on it.
- Mmm.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.741
Sounds like you put a lot
more than your finger on him.

30:50.765 --> 30:53.310
- Don't make me choke you out.
- Hey!

30:54.143 --> 30:55.354
Watch the tofu supreme!

30:55.437 --> 30:57.897
- [laughing]
- And watch the hair!

30:57.981 --> 30:59.774
This takes time.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.651
It's too much product.

31:15.457 --> 31:16.458
[Domingo] Damn.

31:18.793 --> 31:23.798
You can't really appreciate this
place till the lights are on.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.300
Fall back, Zip.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.681
Domingo's right.

31:34.058 --> 31:36.185
When the lights are on...

31:36.270 --> 31:38.688
you really can see
things for what they are.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.816
[speaking Spanish]

31:43.318 --> 31:45.779
- I got some verdad for you.
- Hmm.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.282
We got hit. And it was you.

31:50.033 --> 31:53.620
You didn't have to send no
mercs to break up my organization.

31:53.703 --> 31:56.415
I think somebody's pulling your chain...

31:56.498 --> 31:58.166
and using my name to do it.

31:59.293 --> 32:03.087
'Cause if my people were
to hit you, you'd be dead.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.172
[speaks Spanish]

32:13.473 --> 32:14.599
[chuckles]

32:14.683 --> 32:17.226
You know what a plover is, Cornell?

32:22.566 --> 32:27.070
Plover bird sits inside
the crocodile's mouth.

32:27.153 --> 32:28.447
This bird ain't stupid.

32:29.614 --> 32:34.328
The plover picks scraps of
meat out of the crocodile's teeth,

32:34.411 --> 32:37.163
helping the crocodile avoid infection.

32:37.246 --> 32:40.750
And the plover... he gets a free meal.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.461
[Stokes chuckles]

32:42.544 --> 32:46.172
Where's this analogy
going, Animal Planet? [laughs]

32:50.927 --> 32:52.178
You're a plover.

32:55.098 --> 32:56.308
I'm a crocodile.

32:57.517 --> 33:00.687
You peddle your
guns, picking up my scraps.

33:04.023 --> 33:05.484
And I allow it.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.118
So you admit raidin' me?

33:15.201 --> 33:16.370
[scoffs]

33:20.039 --> 33:22.479
- You think I need to bust your shit up?
- [wrapper crinkling]

33:27.130 --> 33:29.298
You broke your word, Cornell.

33:31.092 --> 33:33.720
How does Diamondback feel about that?

33:39.809 --> 33:43.772
You didn't think I knew... who
your supplier was that night, huh?

33:45.690 --> 33:48.485
I was just checking to see if
you would tell me the truth.

33:55.825 --> 33:57.369
I want a refund.

33:57.452 --> 34:00.204
- [scoffs]
- Or the product that was promised me.

34:00.288 --> 34:03.291
[laughing] Oh, Domingo.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.129
There ain't no return policy.

34:08.212 --> 34:10.255
This ain't L.L. Bean.

34:10.339 --> 34:11.340
[scoffs]

34:19.223 --> 34:21.518
[breathes heavily]

34:21.601 --> 34:23.268
[speaking Spanish]

34:39.202 --> 34:40.203
Nice.

34:45.123 --> 34:47.793
So? What's poppin'?

34:51.380 --> 34:53.882
Better get that Spanish dictionary.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.430
Domingo Colon just declared war on us.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.111
[indistinct chatter]

35:35.383 --> 35:37.301
[man] Councilwoman, let
me get that for you.

35:46.019 --> 35:48.855
[hip-hop song playing]

36:02.243 --> 36:04.579
[grunts]

36:18.552 --> 36:20.637
[breathing heavily]

36:22.055 --> 36:24.558
[grunts]

36:24.641 --> 36:26.309
[guns firing]

36:32.231 --> 36:33.858
[man screams]

36:36.611 --> 36:39.197
- Come here! Come here!
- [both grunting]

36:41.783 --> 36:42.742
[guns firing]

36:42.826 --> 36:44.869
- [bullets clattering]
- [Luke groaning]

36:47.789 --> 36:49.290
[man] How the hell did he do that?

36:51.125 --> 36:53.502
- [Luke grunting]
- [man groaning]

37:01.469 --> 37:03.722
[men talking indistinctly]

37:05.765 --> 37:07.601
[guns firing]

37:07.684 --> 37:09.143
[steam hissing]

37:11.395 --> 37:14.315
[all grunting]

37:57.692 --> 37:59.152
[bone cracking]

38:00.278 --> 38:01.445
[bone cracking]

38:02.947 --> 38:05.116
[Luke grunting]

38:22.466 --> 38:24.177
[bullet ricochets]

38:28.181 --> 38:29.473
[whimpers]

38:30.099 --> 38:31.309
[screams]

39:15.144 --> 39:16.395
[chuckles]

39:22.744 --> 39:24.213
[Scarfe] <i>It's a lot of money.</i>

39:24.237 --> 39:26.197
What?

39:26.280 --> 39:28.324
[Scarfe] <i>In the duffel
bags. It's a lot of money.</i>

39:28.407 --> 39:29.993
Just give me a second.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.328
[Scarfe] <i>Millions.</i>

39:41.713 --> 39:42.922
It's you.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.388
Damn it, you're doing it again. [sighs]

39:50.471 --> 39:52.932
Damn it, you just
broke my concentration.

39:53.016 --> 39:56.394
As usual, your priorities
are all out of whack.

39:57.478 --> 40:01.858
Now, you're looking at a
picture of an empty husk of a building.

40:01.941 --> 40:04.402
I'm looking at millions
of dollars of contraband.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.780
You know this money belongs
to Cottonmouth.

40:06.863 --> 40:08.197
- Allegedly.
- [sighs]

40:08.281 --> 40:09.991
Allegedly.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.745
Thing I can't figure out...

40:13.828 --> 40:16.164
why would somebody...

40:16.247 --> 40:18.166
go through all this hell outside,

40:18.249 --> 40:21.127
cause all this mayhem, and
then leave the money behind?

40:24.088 --> 40:27.050
[sighs] To take it off the streets.

40:27.133 --> 40:29.093
Once it's logged,

40:29.177 --> 40:32.138
whoever it belongs to doesn't
have access to it anymore.

40:32.221 --> 40:34.348
That's quite a message someone's
trying to send.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.852
All that gunfire and no bodies.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.104
Oh, you got that right.

40:40.188 --> 40:43.900
They are nobodies. [sighing]

40:43.983 --> 40:46.610
I mean, no bodies.

40:46.735 --> 40:48.196
Not one.

40:48.279 --> 40:52.575
Some big black dude in a
hoodie takes on direct bullet shots...

40:52.658 --> 40:54.911
slaps, punches and pulls
people all over the place

40:54.994 --> 40:56.704
and doesn't kill a single one?

40:56.788 --> 40:58.497
That doesn't seem strange to you?

40:59.207 --> 41:01.584
It's like this person wanted
us to shut this place down.

41:01.667 --> 41:03.169
Who cares?

41:04.753 --> 41:05.880
What?

41:05.964 --> 41:07.548
I'm serious.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.426
Who cares?

41:11.760 --> 41:15.598
How many investigations, from the
time we put boots on the ground,

41:15.681 --> 41:18.517
begin and end in these projects?

41:18.601 --> 41:19.811
Dozens.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.645
And now somebody comes along

41:21.729 --> 41:26.985
and wants to clean up a year's
worth of patrol work by himself?

41:27.068 --> 41:30.071
[stammers] I don't see
anything wrong with that.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.865
A vigilante?

41:31.948 --> 41:33.908
Yeah, there's something wrong with that.

41:33.992 --> 41:37.411
It's anarchy, a complete
breakdown of the system.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.705
There are rules and
regulations to what we do.

41:39.788 --> 41:44.961
Yeah, and lawyers... and
paperwork and excuses.

41:45.044 --> 41:48.672
Other than mopping up blood...

41:48.756 --> 41:52.468
and arresting the same
piece of shit over and over,

41:52.551 --> 41:54.637
you know, not much we can do as cops.

41:54.720 --> 41:57.306
Jesus, Scarfe, whose side are you on?

41:57.390 --> 41:59.267
I saw the incident up close.

41:59.350 --> 42:02.811
What we can do as
cops, what we can't do.

42:03.980 --> 42:06.315
Now, unless this
sidearm that I'm wearing

42:06.399 --> 42:09.318
suddenly turns into some
kind of magic hammer...

42:09.402 --> 42:11.029
this whole job is irrelevant. [scoffs]

42:12.655 --> 42:14.490
They have no training.

42:14.573 --> 42:16.492
No responsibility.

42:16.575 --> 42:18.411
You have to know what you're doing.

42:18.494 --> 42:23.082
They don't have the right to just
start meting out justice. Come on.

42:23.166 --> 42:26.544
Some guy in a hoodie...

42:26.627 --> 42:30.423
hits various gun-running
spots around the city today?

42:30.506 --> 42:31.840
I think that's wonderful.

42:31.925 --> 42:33.176
I think we should thank him.

42:33.259 --> 42:35.469
- For doing our job?
- Exactly.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.721
I don't like paperwork...

42:37.805 --> 42:39.486
but I'd rather get a
paper cut on my finger

42:39.557 --> 42:41.142
than a bullet in my ass.

42:41.225 --> 42:44.020
Look at... Look at
all them rounds. Look.

42:44.103 --> 42:45.873
You really wanna be in
the middle of all this?

42:45.897 --> 42:48.524
And for what? [stutters]
For a chicken banquet dinner

42:48.607 --> 42:51.110
and a photo with the mayor
as a reward? [scoffing]

42:51.194 --> 42:52.778
- Hell, no.
- Wow.

42:54.238 --> 42:58.076
You are a credit to the badge, Scarfe.

42:58.159 --> 42:59.785
[cell phone ringing]

43:01.662 --> 43:02.830
Hello.

43:03.664 --> 43:05.083
Glad to hear it.

43:07.876 --> 43:09.045
Where?

43:13.299 --> 43:14.592
We'll be there.

43:14.675 --> 43:16.385
- It has to be you.
- [Scarfe] Uh-huh.

43:16.469 --> 43:18.471
I'll pick you up out front.

43:20.348 --> 43:21.349
That was Chico.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.810
He wants to talk, needs a pick up.

43:25.811 --> 43:28.564
- This is where you say, "I told you so"?
- Somethin' like that.

43:29.315 --> 43:31.442
- You coming?
- No.

43:31.525 --> 43:35.238
Your guy in the hoodie left
plenty for the real cops to clean up.

43:35.321 --> 43:38.950
I'll get Chico to give up
the ghost. We got rapport.

43:39.033 --> 43:41.119
Yeah, you're all about rapport.

43:41.202 --> 43:43.204
Oh, you know that.

43:43.287 --> 43:44.372
See you when I see you.

43:45.957 --> 43:47.000
[scoffs]

43:47.708 --> 43:50.128
Did you see the guy who attacked you?

43:50.211 --> 43:53.089
[tsks] Man, I ain't see shit.

43:53.172 --> 43:55.424
I really need that trademark.

44:01.305 --> 44:03.807
[ship horn blaring]

44:03.891 --> 44:07.186
[Scarfe] I was always
a Jumbo's guy myself.

44:07.270 --> 44:10.939
Used to love Willie
Burger back in the day.

44:11.940 --> 44:15.153
But I can't give up
the fries. [chuckling]

44:15.236 --> 44:16.362
True.

44:18.322 --> 44:20.033
Where's Detective Knight?

44:21.534 --> 44:22.701
Busy.

44:25.704 --> 44:27.706
I suppose you heard about...

44:27.790 --> 44:30.293
what happened at the
Crispus Attucks today.

44:34.005 --> 44:35.173
That's why I called.

44:38.426 --> 44:39.593
It's my turn.

44:41.679 --> 44:43.347
Your turn for what?

44:44.807 --> 44:47.018
Tell you everything.

44:51.689 --> 44:53.023
I'm listening.

44:55.401 --> 44:57.653
Somebody told me...

44:57.736 --> 44:59.988
we owe it to Pops to come forward.

45:01.990 --> 45:04.452
He did his part.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.162
I gotta do mine.

45:10.166 --> 45:11.959
I'm ready to talk.

45:14.128 --> 45:15.338
Cottonmouth.

45:16.422 --> 45:18.132
I'll name names, dates.

45:19.425 --> 45:20.759
The whole nine.

45:25.639 --> 45:26.807
Pop...

45:27.891 --> 45:31.229
he used to always talk to
me about responsibility.

45:33.606 --> 45:34.982
About being a man.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.445
Standing up straight.

45:43.031 --> 45:44.825
He told me to take charge.

45:45.743 --> 45:48.287
Forward, never backwards.

45:51.249 --> 45:53.709
[stutters]

45:53.792 --> 45:56.337
Luke Cage, I don't even... [gasps]

45:56.420 --> 45:58.422
[Scarfe grunting]

45:58.506 --> 46:00.174
[choking]

46:16.440 --> 46:18.484
[panting]

46:23.364 --> 46:24.948
[sniffs]

46:59.024 --> 47:00.609
[glass shattering]

47:00.693 --> 47:03.779
- $7 million!
- Cornell!

47:03.862 --> 47:06.240
You don't wanna be in my
face right now, Mariah!

47:06.324 --> 47:08.909
If anybody should be breaking
shit, it should be me!

47:08.992 --> 47:11.620
They hit my office. My office!

47:11.704 --> 47:13.789
They took damn near every penny I got,

47:13.872 --> 47:15.392
and you up here talkin' about an office?

47:15.416 --> 47:17.376
You can always make more money.

47:17.460 --> 47:20.128
I can't get my name back.

47:20.213 --> 47:24.049
And somebody is gonna
start asking questions.

47:24.132 --> 47:27.261
- Step off, Cornell!
- Shut up, Black Mariah.

47:28.721 --> 47:30.264
That's my shit to break!

47:31.181 --> 47:34.935
You better shut up, or I will
cut your color-struck ass.

47:35.018 --> 47:36.061
Call me that again.

47:37.646 --> 47:38.897
Uh, Mr. Stokes?

47:40.023 --> 47:41.400
Spit it out.

47:41.484 --> 47:44.653
There's... There's a
detective here to see you.

47:46.280 --> 47:47.698
The cops are here?

47:51.827 --> 47:54.663
- Detective.
- Well, I've had warmer receptions.

47:54.747 --> 47:59.084
What's the use of having a pig on
payroll if you can't get no early intel?

47:59.167 --> 48:02.255
[scoffing] Oh, I've got
your intel. Swinging.

48:02.338 --> 48:03.839
[chuckles softly]

48:08.218 --> 48:09.637
Oh, yeah.

48:13.391 --> 48:15.768
[pouring drink]

48:18.604 --> 48:19.730
[grunts]

48:23.776 --> 48:27.488
Anything related to how I
lost 80% of my cash reserves?

48:28.406 --> 48:30.533
Maybe. Maybe.

48:33.536 --> 48:37.415
In my trunk, you will
find a deceased individual.

48:37.498 --> 48:40.125
One Wilfredo "Chico" Diaz.

48:40.208 --> 48:42.169
I'm sure your homie down
at Spurlock's Mortuary

48:42.252 --> 48:43.587
can hook you up.

48:45.088 --> 48:47.300
So that's off your
plate. You're welcome.

48:51.219 --> 48:53.263
What else you got for me?

48:53.347 --> 48:54.557
What else I got for ya?

48:55.349 --> 48:58.311
What else I got... Oh, well...

48:58.394 --> 49:01.229
I know who's been busting
up your shit all day,

49:01.314 --> 49:04.900
and who raided the
projects... all by himself.

49:06.276 --> 49:09.905
Don't imagine you know anything about...

49:11.407 --> 49:13.659
Luke Cage, do you?

49:14.368 --> 49:15.744
Luke Cage?

49:17.455 --> 49:19.623
That's who did all this shit?

49:19.707 --> 49:21.334
That's what I'm telling you.

49:22.543 --> 49:26.296
And as a proud NYPD detective...

49:26.380 --> 49:28.757
see, my partner and I, well...

49:28.841 --> 49:30.593
we're accountable for each other.

49:30.676 --> 49:33.929
We need to know each
other's whereabouts, 24/7.

49:34.012 --> 49:37.516
And thanks to my
partner's GPS on her phone,

49:37.600 --> 49:40.310
I got Mr. Cage's home address.

49:40.394 --> 49:41.520
And I will give it to you...

49:41.604 --> 49:44.022
if you're a good boy.

49:44.106 --> 49:45.315
[chuckles]

49:47.568 --> 49:48.819
Virginia Slim...

49:50.195 --> 49:52.030
you just might prove to be useful.

49:52.114 --> 49:53.907
Virginia Slim, what's that?

49:53.991 --> 49:56.535
What else do you
call a skinny white bitch?

49:56.619 --> 49:57.995
[laughs]

49:59.079 --> 50:01.957
Time for me to go
holler at the dishwasher.

50:02.040 --> 50:03.166
Personally.

50:05.210 --> 50:08.464
Don't want to know the
details. Just get it done.

50:10.633 --> 50:12.885
[music playing faintly]

50:23.311 --> 50:24.438
[grunts]

50:25.898 --> 50:27.107
[door closes]

50:28.025 --> 50:29.610
Goddamn, negro.

50:30.778 --> 50:33.155
You all right? What happened
to you? You get hit by a bus?

50:34.448 --> 50:36.241
Swear jar.

50:36.324 --> 50:37.325
You cursed.

50:37.410 --> 50:41.497
Swear jar? Come on, man. I...

50:41.580 --> 50:43.999
All right, look, I don't
have anything on me now.

50:54.427 --> 50:55.636
[Luke] Yeah, you do.

50:57.888 --> 51:00.558
Now you've got
change that can make change.

51:02.601 --> 51:05.479
- [sighs]
- What the hell did you do?

51:06.814 --> 51:09.650
Oh, can you forget the
swear jar for a minute?

51:11.735 --> 51:13.236
What the...

51:21.119 --> 51:23.246
Where'd all this money come from?

51:24.206 --> 51:27.042
Bank's not worried about
it... neither should you.

51:28.586 --> 51:30.087
Use it for this.

51:32.130 --> 51:34.049
You ain't gotta tell me twice.

51:34.132 --> 51:36.677
Ask no questions, tell no lies.

51:36.760 --> 51:39.888
I'll call some people and we
get started on this in here.

51:41.098 --> 51:42.349
Good.

51:43.476 --> 51:45.519
I see you been at it.

51:45.603 --> 51:46.604
[scoffs] Yeah.

51:47.312 --> 51:48.522
You, too.

51:52.776 --> 51:54.111
Why haven't you gone home yet?

51:54.194 --> 51:55.946
[sighs]

51:56.029 --> 51:58.657
Couldn't leave this
place lookin' so bad.

51:58.741 --> 52:01.744
That was the thing about Pops.
He had a lot of pride in detail.

52:01.827 --> 52:05.623
Like that gold leaf window with
the Pop's Barber Shop logo?

52:05.706 --> 52:09.084
[chuckles] I polished it every day.

52:10.002 --> 52:13.213
P-O-P. Had to
be spotless.

52:13.296 --> 52:15.007
[chuckling]

52:15.090 --> 52:17.801
First thing Pop said
when he hired me was,

52:17.885 --> 52:20.137
"You do windows, brother."

52:20.220 --> 52:22.598
- That wasn't no question.
- [both chuckling]

52:24.349 --> 52:25.684
[sighs]

52:31.982 --> 52:33.651
We need this place open.

52:34.860 --> 52:36.069
I know.

52:39.865 --> 52:41.366
You gonna run it?

52:41.449 --> 52:43.536
I ain't no barber.

52:43.619 --> 52:44.912
What about you?

52:44.995 --> 52:47.330
[sighing]

52:49.457 --> 52:52.002
Another question for
another time, my man.

52:54.337 --> 52:57.132
We gotta figure out something
soon either way.

53:00.427 --> 53:02.220
[sighs] I will.

53:03.388 --> 53:05.140
You should know that about me by now.

53:06.266 --> 53:07.768
I like to get things done.

53:08.811 --> 53:10.437
Oh...

53:10.520 --> 53:11.855
Where you goin' now?

53:13.440 --> 53:15.108
I'm starving.

53:20.280 --> 53:22.032
[whistles softly]

53:28.581 --> 53:29.915
[sighs]

53:34.169 --> 53:36.421
I've never seen you eat so much.

53:37.505 --> 53:39.633
I guess I worked up a
bit of an appetite today.

53:39.717 --> 53:41.343
Did you go for your run?

53:42.803 --> 53:44.429
Something like that.

53:56.024 --> 53:57.525
The food wasn't that good.

53:57.610 --> 53:59.737
I just wanted to make things right.

54:02.572 --> 54:04.366
Where'd the money come from?

54:04.449 --> 54:05.993
It doesn't matter.

54:06.994 --> 54:09.496
What matters is what you do with it.

54:32.728 --> 54:34.271
Sweet sister!

54:46.825 --> 54:48.526
[chuckles]

54:52.414 --> 54:54.416
