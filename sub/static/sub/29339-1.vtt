00:27.444 --> 00:30.356
There's the North Korea leader,
also known as king right there,

00:30.364 --> 00:33.106
live on your screen right now,
walking into position.

00:33.116 --> 00:37.359
Obviously he is alone, unattended.
Coming in.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.237
Here comes the president
of the United States.

00:40.249 --> 00:44.117
And here are the two gentlemen,
let's watch the moment.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.285
Yes, that was the beginning.

00:46.463 --> 00:49.079
The moment of peace
when the entire world was watching.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.965
As always, they expected
something to happen,

00:51.969 --> 00:56.053
but it took a while for
the agreement to reach fruition.

00:57.015 --> 01:01.008
North Korea will begin
a full-scale denuclearization process.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.726
The un approved removal
of sanctions on North Korea,

01:03.730 --> 01:04.765
and China immediately...

01:04.772 --> 01:06.263
Chinese car manufactures

01:06.275 --> 01:09.312
started a large scale import of
north Korean iron ore.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.355
Us economy was suffering due to

01:11.363 --> 01:14.196
prolonged trade protection
policy with China.

01:14.366 --> 01:17.483
But China found a solution
with its domestic market.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.323
Workers in Detroit
will go on strike today.

01:21.331 --> 01:25.665
It is projected that the market for
the us automobile industry will decline.

01:25.669 --> 01:29.002
The general strike is spreading to
Wisconsin and Ohio-

01:29.006 --> 01:32.169
what's certain is that, lifting of
north Korean trade restrictions

01:32.175 --> 01:33.711
has weakened us markets.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.880
The 3 states that are
the biggest battlegrounds

01:35.887 --> 01:37.548
in next year's
presidential election, will...

01:37.556 --> 01:40.639
I'm sure if McGregor loses
those 3 states, he will lose.

01:40.642 --> 01:43.179
President McGregor seems to
be turning back the clock.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.302
According to a military insider,

01:45.314 --> 01:48.101
the Pentagon is said to
put a very large bounty

01:48.108 --> 01:50.064
on North Korea's supreme leader,

01:50.068 --> 01:51.148
informally known as 'king',

01:51.153 --> 01:55.112
the amount is said to be on par with
that of Saddam Hussein and bin laden.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.275
Why?

01:56.700 --> 01:59.237
Because North Korea
doesn't help the election at all.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.781
Did the u.S ever get into
a war with Iraq over

02:01.788 --> 02:03.574
weapons of mass destruction?

02:04.249 --> 02:05.238
Absolutely not.

02:05.250 --> 02:09.584
President McGregor's approval rating is
setting record new low every single day.

02:09.588 --> 02:13.797
The bigger problem is still
the yet-to-be disarned north Korean...

02:13.800 --> 02:15.961
The north Korean
nuclear program.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.879
To sum up if nuclear weapons
exist in North Korea,

02:19.973 --> 02:22.715
McGregor will not
get a second term.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.176
Okay, I've switched to
a secured line.

02:25.270 --> 02:28.012
Agent MacKenzie, we ran
this op through a simulation,

02:28.148 --> 02:30.639
and the president's approval rating
will double if it is successful.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.016
And that's just within 4 hours.

02:32.027 --> 02:35.190
53%, to be exact.
McGregor will win.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.859
And I'll be transferred back to
Langley as a part of the deal.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.073
Alright,
but here's what bothers me.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.068
I understand that
for security reasons,

02:42.079 --> 02:45.196
you contracted a pmc instead of
using our own military.

02:45.207 --> 02:48.119
But looking through these files,
these mercenaries are from

02:48.126 --> 02:52.085
Latvia, Columbia,
Mexico and even Sierra Leone.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.912
They're all illegal aliens.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.503
What I'm trying to say is,
can you entrust such

02:56.510 --> 02:59.217
a critical operation to these
money-hungry thugs?

02:59.304 --> 03:00.464
What if something goes wrong?

03:00.472 --> 03:02.212
That is precisely why.

03:02.224 --> 03:03.384
If something does go wrong,

03:03.392 --> 03:06.099
it will be easy to cut any ties
to the illegal aliens.

03:06.144 --> 03:09.181
But rest assured,
these guys do not make mistakes.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.682
How are you so certain?

03:11.024 --> 03:14.061
Ahab. He is raptor 16's captain,

03:14.152 --> 03:16.768
and at the CIA, we all love him.

03:16.780 --> 03:20.022
He has not once failed us
in the past 6 years.

03:20.158 --> 03:23.776
He always gets the job done
on time and never leaves a mess.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.202
And of course,
today will be no exception.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.905
Wait, 'ahab'?
Is that his real name?

03:29.126 --> 03:30.161
It's a codename.

03:30.252 --> 03:34.165
He got in the Korean special forces,
after a parachute accident.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.045
Parachute accident?
What happened?

03:36.049 --> 03:39.212
One moment.
Mr. secretary, the target is arriving.

03:39.219 --> 03:43.178
I have to go and you should
work on the victory speech.

03:45.142 --> 03:48.225
So, what did you do?

03:50.480 --> 03:53.187
Here's the question.
What'd you have done?

03:54.484 --> 03:57.601
Well, will my answer reflect
on my evaluation, captain?

03:57.696 --> 03:58.981
Hey, intern.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.230
This is the climax of the story.

04:01.324 --> 04:04.191
So think carefully
before you answer him.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.738
My name is not intern.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.327
It's Logan Smith,
I'm from Illinois.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.536
Illinois.

04:09.207 --> 04:10.162
He's a yank?

04:10.167 --> 04:14.285
Yeah. Hacked a surveillance cam and
caught police beating up civilians.

04:14.296 --> 04:17.754
Uploaded the footage on YouTube
and got himself a year in the pen.

04:20.051 --> 04:22.838
American ex-cons still have it
better than illegal aliens.

04:22.846 --> 04:23.961
Right, captain?

04:23.972 --> 04:25.462
With this stupid ass president,

04:25.474 --> 04:27.274
being a U.S. citizen ain't
what it used to be.

04:30.353 --> 04:33.015
You're an illegal, captain?
I thought you were American.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.725
Here we go.

04:40.655 --> 04:41.735
Look alive, guys.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.105
Bogey entering tunnel.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.357
I want this over and done
in 10 minutes.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.654
Roger that.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.619
Answer the question.

04:49.748 --> 04:52.956
There's a 100% chance you'll live
if you ditch your teammate,

04:53.001 --> 04:55.708
but if you hang on to him,
survival's a crap shoot.

04:55.712 --> 04:59.045
Yo, intern.
Think carefully, huh?

05:01.843 --> 05:04.209
I'd hang onto him,
just like you did, captain.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.631
Fuck you!

05:07.516 --> 05:09.802
You know you just got
your ass killed, right?

05:09.935 --> 05:11.345
Then I'll learn from you,
captain,

05:11.436 --> 05:13.347
find out how we
get out of this alive.

05:13.355 --> 05:14.891
Give me the operation brief.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.398
At precisely 1800 hours,

05:18.485 --> 05:21.522
young-taek rhee, minister of
the people's armed forces of n. Korea,

05:21.530 --> 05:26.115
will attend a secret talk
with the rok cfc commander.

05:26.117 --> 05:29.405
Our team, raptor 1-6,
will abduct and transport him.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.403
Safety of the target
is first objective,

05:32.082 --> 05:33.447
and the mission must be
completed within 10 min-

05:33.458 --> 05:36.370
let's say a team member and the target
are wounded during the mission,

05:36.378 --> 05:37.959
who do you secure first?

05:39.756 --> 05:41.417
Per protocol, the target
is our main priority, sir.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.086
So you're going to leave
your teammate to die?

05:44.261 --> 05:45.421
No, no, sir.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.673
I'd, I'd have to
figure out a way...

05:47.681 --> 05:50.548
What if you get shot?
Will you still save them?

05:50.642 --> 05:53.429
Run back to Illinois, intern.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.431
You can say you're gonna
save someone,

05:55.438 --> 05:57.429
but when you got bullets
giving you a buzz cut,

05:57.524 --> 05:59.890
you only think about
your own ass.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.063
But you saved that guy,
though, right?

06:06.324 --> 06:08.736
I've peed like
30 fucking times today.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.275
It's cancer of the prostrate.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.243
It's prostate, sweetheart.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.696
Did I tell you my wife is pregnant?

06:14.916 --> 06:16.577
Only every time that you piss.

06:16.585 --> 06:20.248
The closer her due date gets,
the crazier my bladder gets.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.540
When's she due?

06:22.924 --> 06:25.757
Once this is wrapped up,
I'm off to the airport,

06:25.844 --> 06:27.459
heading to a hospital in Philly.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.510
She's gonna be induced.

06:30.056 --> 06:33.548
So tomorrow, I'll be a papa!

06:38.315 --> 06:40.101
Thank you, fuck faces.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.480
Logan, how're we looking?

06:46.406 --> 06:49.443
There's no connected external
circuit save a single hotline

06:49.451 --> 06:50.531
that the CIA put in,

06:50.535 --> 06:53.447
but I can access a channel out
via inner circuit bypass

06:53.455 --> 06:55.286
and go through the orbital sat.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.496
The connection period is
gonna be limited though...

06:56.499 --> 06:57.705
Wait.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.374
Wanna speak Korean?

07:00.420 --> 07:03.912
Usually, the communication's
satellite orbital period takes 40 min,

07:03.924 --> 07:07.462
I may be able to connect to it for
about 3 min once it passes us...

07:07.469 --> 07:11.053
Raptor 1-6, come in.
This is station 1-0

07:13.767 --> 07:16.053
Mac, where have you been?

07:16.144 --> 07:17.634
We've been looking for you!

07:18.104 --> 07:18.889
Is something wrong?

07:18.897 --> 07:23.732
First off, we'd like to thank you for
putting us up in this wonderful suite.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.481
We lowly illegals
would've never been able to afford

07:26.488 --> 07:29.730
anything like this
without your assistance.

07:30.075 --> 07:32.532
But can I ask you
a couple of questions?

07:32.827 --> 07:34.408
Have you verified the convoy?

07:34.412 --> 07:37.654
1, how does a place like this
not have ESPN?

07:37.666 --> 07:39.281
Ahab, verify the convoy.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.499
And 2, the op brief
originally stated

07:41.503 --> 07:43.539
the meeting would take place
in a Seoul hotel room,

07:43.713 --> 07:45.419
but an hour ago,
your team changed it

07:45.423 --> 07:48.381
to this underground bunker
straddling the mdl.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.468
As much as we love the room,
it's got no Wi-Fi,

07:51.471 --> 07:53.553
no phone signal, and no sports.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.301
What's up with that?

07:58.520 --> 07:59.520
Fine.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.395
The bunker is part of a series
of tunnels dug by

08:02.399 --> 08:04.230
n. Korea during the cold war.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.520
They were designed
for invading South Korea.

08:06.528 --> 08:09.770
But upon discovery, these were put
under 24-hour surveillance.

08:09.781 --> 08:13.524
The whole area has been
renovated to serve as a meeting point

08:13.535 --> 08:15.526
for secret talks
between the two countries.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.036
How the conspiracies mount.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.575
For security purposes,
the entire premises,

08:20.583 --> 08:22.665
including the vip suite
you admire so much,

08:23.128 --> 08:25.961
is restricted from
any unauthorized communication.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.626
Call that number
when you get a signal.

08:32.636 --> 08:35.424
If you don't do it before
the op begins, you're out.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.303
Meaning, what happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.475
It's the ideal place
for the operation.

08:41.479 --> 08:42.594
Now, show me the venue.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.937
Why keep us in the dark
about it?

08:45.567 --> 08:47.853
Ahab, show me the venue!

08:50.196 --> 08:50.901
Gerald?

08:50.905 --> 08:55.069
Raptor 1-6, that is
the only angle we have.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.380
ID confirmation negative.
Secure a better angle.

09:04.461 --> 09:07.248
Mac, you saw the convoy come in.
Who else would it be?

09:07.255 --> 09:08.586
Secure a better angle.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.749
I'm beginning to think
you don't trust us.

09:13.553 --> 09:18.013
You have always been
on point and precise.

09:18.433 --> 09:19.889
But I've been here in Korea

09:19.893 --> 09:21.758
for the past 6 years
planning this operation

09:21.770 --> 09:24.637
and I'm not going to blow it
over something like trust.

09:24.731 --> 09:28.269
So, in accordance with professionalism,
how about doing me a courtesy?

09:30.695 --> 09:33.983
You mean like you did the courtesy
of telling us about the location change?

09:34.908 --> 09:36.444
You got 5 minutes.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.447
Gerald.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.533
Try and find another angle,
will ya?

09:42.540 --> 09:45.247
This is her last job,
so I guess we'll be nice.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.745
Really? Is she quitting?

09:46.753 --> 09:50.587
When McGregor fails to get re-elected,
his people will get the boot.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.127
They'll be lucky to work for
city halls in the boonies.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.586
Pues mejor.
It's better for us, no?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.462
Don't democrats pardon illegals?

09:59.516 --> 10:02.508
Jesus, man!
You smell like shit today!

10:02.519 --> 10:04.555
When was the last time
you washed your ass?

10:04.562 --> 10:07.520
You better keep following this ass
or you gonna get lost, pendejo.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.014
Two man. Both of you shut up.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.641
Captain!
If the opposition takes control,

10:11.778 --> 10:14.485
then we don't need to worry
about medical insurance

10:14.489 --> 10:15.820
or kids' school no more, right?

10:15.907 --> 10:17.772
No more of this
ullshit either, right?

10:17.784 --> 10:19.615
Wake up and smell
the sewage, guys.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.281
You think the politicians
give a damn about people like us,

10:22.288 --> 10:24.950
people who can't vote?
It's all bullshit.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.495
No one's gonna help us,
here or out there.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.542
It's every man for himself.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.703
You know,
you should count one out.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.832
We got a vote-dodger
only here for the money.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.088
I casted an early vote.

10:38.263 --> 10:39.263
Captain.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.924
I got a friend at the embassy,

10:41.141 --> 10:43.803
who said a war's coming.
I think he might be right.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.764
Why? Because of your president?

10:48.731 --> 10:50.312
On the day of the super bowl,

10:50.316 --> 10:54.434
a homeless woman and her kid were shot
in front of the supermarket in my hometown.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.770
They were begging for help
on the sidewalk.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.646
Not a single soul
paid any attention.

10:58.658 --> 11:03.778
That's not just one or two people's fault.
That's everyone's, you know?

11:04.330 --> 11:05.945
Fuck that!

11:06.082 --> 11:08.164
Why are you even here?

11:08.251 --> 11:12.415
Go be a fucking supermarket
security guard.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.713
I was one,

11:17.302 --> 11:20.135
until I realized how much
it cost to raise a kid.

11:21.806 --> 11:22.806
Alright.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.553
Let's say the world's ass rotten
as you think it is.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.391
What's that got to do with war?

11:29.731 --> 11:32.313
No one would stop one
from happening.

11:32.483 --> 11:35.600
People don't give a shit
unless it directly affects them,

11:35.612 --> 11:38.570
if that keeps up, it's just gonna
build until it finally explodes.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.067
Hey, captain,

11:41.743 --> 11:43.699
so if a war broke out today,

11:43.912 --> 11:46.824
would you do the same thing
you did with that parachute guy?

11:54.464 --> 11:57.206
War's a bit more complicated
than that, son.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.750
But if one does break out,
just remember one thing:

12:01.262 --> 12:05.005
When you're on a mission, the most
important principle to follow is...

12:05.016 --> 12:06.176
Captain!

12:06.601 --> 12:07.716
We got something!

12:15.193 --> 12:16.979
What the fuck?

12:19.239 --> 12:21.150
Station 1-0, this is raptor 1-6.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.074
Missile spotted over Seoul,
possible scud, confirm visual.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.410
I repeat, missile spotted over Seoul,
confirm visual.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.049
Raptor 1-6, visual confirmed.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.966
A north Korean scud,
it was intercepted by a pac-3.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.759
Fuck!

12:52.272 --> 12:53.978
We were nearly set up too.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.055
We came all the way here...

12:57.819 --> 12:58.979
Okay, starting evac!

12:58.987 --> 13:01.023
Negative, proceed as planned.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.606
Mac, we're at the military demarcation line
and 5 minutes from North Korea.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.528
A war could start at any second,
and you want us to...

13:06.536 --> 13:10.779
Older patriot pac-3 models have a target
interception rate of less than 10%.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.906
This one hit its Mark
on the second try.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.205
You knew the scud was coming?

13:18.172 --> 13:19.252
Yes.

13:19.549 --> 13:20.789
Because we launched it.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.881
General rhee knows
we're coming in for him.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.967
We told him we'd help him
defect on the condition

13:28.975 --> 13:30.886
that he fires
a sscuup over Seoul.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.763
That gives us cause.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.102
Cause for what?

13:35.189 --> 13:37.726
Nuclear disarmament
of nv. Korea.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.694
You got to be shitting me.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.276
The U.S. 7th fleet stationed
in the east sea,

13:45.283 --> 13:50.619
usfj and the entire U.S. armed forces
in Korea are standing by.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.572
Once the general gives us coordinates
to the north's arsenal,

13:53.583 --> 13:55.790
nuclear disarmament will
only take minutes,

13:55.793 --> 13:58.876
and the n. Korean government will be
dismantled by the end of the day.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.093
And the white house approved this?

14:07.096 --> 14:08.427
On a day like today?

14:08.431 --> 14:10.171
Because of a day like today.

14:12.894 --> 14:16.978
Moments ago, a n. Korean missile
was shot down above Seoul.

14:16.981 --> 14:21.065
Although it's been confirmed the missile
was not armed with a nuclear warhead,

14:21.069 --> 14:24.812
the attack seems clearly timed with
today's presidential election.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.980
The missile was believed to
be a scud missile,

14:26.991 --> 14:29.528
and flew about 121 miles...

14:30.578 --> 14:33.786
This isn't a military op!
It's a fucking election campaign!

14:33.915 --> 14:36.247
As things stand,
McGregor'd never be re-elected,

14:36.250 --> 14:40.869
but if news of n. Korean disarmament
airs just before polls open,

14:40.880 --> 14:41.995
he's a shoo-in.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.839
Raptor 1-6,
I'm getting another angle.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.878
Starting to get
facial recognition.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.047
Your safety is still
100% guaranteed,

14:49.138 --> 14:53.131
but let's be honest here,
you want this war to break out.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.508
It's how you make a living.
So nothing changes.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.889
What changes is McGregor
gets 4 more years

14:57.897 --> 14:59.103
and you get a promotion.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.313
What the hell do we get?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.015
What're you getting at, ahab?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.267
That's the situation, right?

15:04.278 --> 15:06.860
We're not the seals,
and considering the revised op,

15:06.906 --> 15:08.862
we should be getting paid more.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.357
So you're just looking out
for your own good.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.614
You don't give a shit about us.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.702
This is not the time to ask
for a few more bucks.

15:15.706 --> 15:18.869
Didn't you try to save those same
few bucks by withholding info from us?

15:18.960 --> 15:21.702
Your company signed a contract.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.248
My hands are tied.

15:24.799 --> 15:25.959
You've got 1 minute.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.004
Well, you better figure out
how to untie them,

15:29.011 --> 15:32.253
because I'm not moving forward
without the right price.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.385
You've got 1 minute, Mac.

15:34.392 --> 15:37.429
Raptor 1-6, we have a situation.
Possible jackpot.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.519
I repeat, possible jackpot!

15:56.456 --> 15:58.913
This changes everything.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.874
Mac, you seeing who I'm seeing?

16:02.920 --> 16:06.003
It's king. I'm sure of it.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.830
He's got his medical staff with him.

16:07.925 --> 16:10.041
Call Langley,
find out what's going on.

16:11.262 --> 16:13.253
Logan, turn down the volume.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.136
Was king included in the op?

16:18.603 --> 16:19.968
No, something's wrong.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.893
Hey, this for real, captain?

16:31.532 --> 16:32.362
Okay.

16:32.450 --> 16:35.112
All units standby
for further instructions.

16:41.125 --> 16:45.664
Mac, we have the chance to get
the most wanted man in east Asia.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.295
What're you saying?
You want to capture king?

16:48.382 --> 16:51.124
What? We're just gonna walk
out of here empty handed?

16:51.135 --> 16:53.501
We have no intel yet
explaining why he's...

16:53.513 --> 16:55.299
What if king came
instead of the general?

16:55.306 --> 16:57.547
If the general's intention
was to defect,

16:57.558 --> 17:00.140
then king must be
after the same thing.

17:00.228 --> 17:02.514
Even so, why did he bring
his medical staff with him?

17:02.605 --> 17:05.142
You know his heart condition
had worsened recently.

17:05.148 --> 17:07.140
Of course, he needs doctors!

17:09.237 --> 17:12.194
King has shown no signs of wanting
to defect for the past 6 months.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.983
Captain, what's happening?

17:13.991 --> 17:15.356
You just hold up. Hold up.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.699
Get ready to move out.

17:17.161 --> 17:20.153
I mean, think about it
from his side.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.117
He knows n. Korea is
a sinking ship,

17:22.124 --> 17:24.079
but instead of
going down with it,

17:24.085 --> 17:26.541
he's collecting his and jumping.

17:27.672 --> 17:30.664
Gerald, give me a weapon count
in the venue and infiltration route.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.040
Are you serious, captain?

17:32.134 --> 17:33.169
Right now!

17:33.177 --> 17:36.840
Even if you're right,
the white house won't authorize this.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.759
If we allow king's defection,

17:39.767 --> 17:41.473
the president's approval ratings
will plummet,

17:41.477 --> 17:43.092
re-election will be impossible.

17:43.104 --> 17:44.810
If he accepts king's defection,

17:44.814 --> 17:46.679
not only can he
assimilate the north,

17:46.691 --> 17:50.400
he can also attract the votes of
the opposition supporters who are anti-war.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.815
Re-election's a no-brainer.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.779
And you get the big reward.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.821
If you caught the general,
you'd get a plaque.

18:02.832 --> 18:06.074
If you catch king,
you'll be the one handing it out.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.122
It's a win-win.

18:12.508 --> 18:13.873
I know you, Mac.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.800
You can't walk away
from something like this.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.137
Can you make it happen?

18:21.142 --> 18:24.134
Raptor 1-6, there are
12 men in the venue.

18:24.228 --> 18:24.967
How many?

18:24.979 --> 18:26.765
12, they're armed,

18:30.359 --> 18:32.224
happy motherfucking holiday.

18:33.321 --> 18:34.777
Ahab, I need confirmation.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.738
If you can't get him,
I'll call in reinforcements.

18:37.742 --> 18:41.155
Captain, if we're going to do this,
we'll need back up.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.250
Standby, Gerald. I'm on my way.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.123
Mac, I'll go get him myself.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.003
I want to make one thing
crystal clear.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.924
Officially, this is
unauthorized action,

18:57.928 --> 19:00.886
which means raptor 1-6
is deviating from the original op.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.050
The United States government

19:02.058 --> 19:04.765
will not be held responsible
for any damages or failures.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.179
Do you acknowledge?

19:11.651 --> 19:14.188
Okay, okay.
No need to lecture us.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.564
We'll get it done
in a few seconds.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.564
Do not proceed until
I give you the green light.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.275
Logan, stop what you're doing.
Get your gear on.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.463
30m under
military demarcation line

19:40.554 --> 19:42.010
so, how does the story end?

19:42.014 --> 19:43.720
Captain saved the guy, right?

19:44.517 --> 19:48.180
You don't need that.
Probably be back in no time.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.766
With his approval
rating tumbling,

19:51.774 --> 19:53.856
is this McGregor's final chance?

19:53.984 --> 19:57.693
This also means how McGregor
responds to this situation

19:57.697 --> 20:00.609
will have a huge effect
on the impending election.

20:00.616 --> 20:03.824
Listen up, ladies.
The operation's been revised.

20:03.911 --> 20:07.904
We're going in after king.
I need someone to take point.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.999
No me jodas!
We're really taking king today?

20:12.253 --> 20:13.038
Hold on, cap.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.001
12 armed hostiles are too many.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.166
Why don't we get backup?

20:16.173 --> 20:18.164
When has this shit ever
been a walk in the park?

20:18.175 --> 20:19.756
Now, who's on point?

20:20.845 --> 20:22.335
Considering the number of men,

20:22.346 --> 20:25.133
location and weapons,
odds are against us.

20:25.266 --> 20:29.009
Chances for casualties are very high.
Someone's gonna get hurt...

20:29.103 --> 20:31.560
It'll be divided amongst us
according to seniority.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.772
If we get backup,
it's divided between us and them.

20:36.944 --> 20:40.061
So... agreed?

20:43.325 --> 20:44.325
Great.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.241
Who's taking point?

20:52.293 --> 20:54.158
What the fuck's with you guys?

20:54.879 --> 20:57.291
Who's going? Should I?

20:57.548 --> 20:58.754
With my leg?

20:59.258 --> 21:04.048
Captain, there is 80% chance
point man will go down.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.295
Now is bad timing.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.888
We do not want to
get in over our head.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.226
Jose? You game?

21:14.774 --> 21:17.311
If we breach,
some hombre goes down.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.686
We need more men.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.809
I know, I know.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.900
But with you up front,
we can pull this off.

21:23.908 --> 21:24.908
Me?

21:25.117 --> 21:27.233
Is it because illegals
don't get kia?

21:27.703 --> 21:28.783
Jose.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.163
We're all in the same boat here.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.250
Do you know why I'm going
through this shit just to get king?

21:36.587 --> 21:39.420
Because I want out just like you.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.089
If you go back to your hometown
empty handed,

21:42.092 --> 21:44.959
you'll be nothing more than
a drug mule all over again.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.586
But if you do this,
if you get king,

21:47.598 --> 21:49.680
there's no more blood
on your hands.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.300
No more shit military missions.

21:52.394 --> 21:56.433
You can have the farm you've always
wanted, an ordinary life.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.647
Dinner with
your family every night.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.687
It's a beautiful fucking ending.

22:01.153 --> 22:04.190
If I die, mi familia eats alone,
if they eat at all.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.487
Jose.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.782
Hear me out.

22:09.370 --> 22:11.952
When the president
of the us gives us an order,

22:11.956 --> 22:13.912
we have to do it no matter what.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.206
You're the quickest
out of all of us,

22:16.210 --> 22:17.620
you'll be fine.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.374
But if someone else
takes point and goes down,

22:20.422 --> 22:22.287
can you sleep with that?

22:26.387 --> 22:27.547
Just trust me.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.837
Get the 2 fucking hostiles
closest to the door.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.340
We'll back you the fuck up 100%.

22:36.146 --> 22:37.306
Captain?

22:38.148 --> 22:39.979
Can I really go home after?

22:42.319 --> 22:43.900
Si, mi hombre.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.355
Thank you.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.404
Okay, Jose's taking point.

22:51.829 --> 22:54.821
We back him up, drop targets fast,
confirm kills.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.280
King is the priority.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.829
No single scratch on his body.
And remember,

22:58.961 --> 23:01.498
they are not the enemies, right?

23:01.672 --> 23:03.287
They're our victims!

23:03.382 --> 23:04.497
Perfecto.

23:13.851 --> 23:14.851
Captain.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.426
You get 3 minutes during
every 40-minute cycle.

23:17.563 --> 23:18.894
Did I pass?

23:21.275 --> 23:23.311
Ji-su

23:23.569 --> 23:25.434
not right now, shit...

23:27.364 --> 23:29.776
Baby, I'm working.
I'll call you later.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.398
Please, hurry!

23:31.827 --> 23:33.533
Honey, I'm sorry.

23:33.787 --> 23:34.822
I'm not feeling well.

23:34.830 --> 23:37.162
Raptor 1-6, mission status
has been revised.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.166
Hold on.

23:38.542 --> 23:39.998
Station 1-0, we're moving in.

23:40.002 --> 23:40.787
Negative.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.285
Operation will be handed over
to the backup team when they arrive.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.787
Eta 5 minutes.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.208
They will capture king.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.422
Wait, wait, Mac!
Why are they coming in?

23:50.429 --> 23:51.544
Too many hostiles.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.261
Backup team will assume command.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.722
I got this! Fuck the 5 minutes!

23:55.726 --> 23:57.136
We won't get another shot.

23:57.311 --> 23:59.552
I'm sorry, but we're
playing it safe.

23:59.563 --> 24:00.563
That's final.

24:01.231 --> 24:02.391
Safe?

24:02.524 --> 24:03.684
Langley saw everything!

24:03.692 --> 24:05.853
Do you want the big dogs to
come in and strip this from you?

24:05.861 --> 24:07.476
We got the order,
we have to go now!

24:07.488 --> 24:09.399
That's it. Open this door!

24:09.406 --> 24:11.362
What the hell are
they doing here?

24:11.575 --> 24:14.362
No, you're not
allowed to be here!

24:14.411 --> 24:16.652
This is my operation!

24:16.747 --> 24:18.487
Stop them! Don't let them in!

24:19.875 --> 24:22.992
Ahab, you said you can
make it happen, right?

24:23.212 --> 24:24.793
Go! Now!

24:26.507 --> 24:28.839
Ji-su, I have to go,
I'll call you afterwards.

24:28.842 --> 24:33.085
I'm heading to the hospital,
I think the baby's coming.

24:33.097 --> 24:33.677
What? Now?

24:33.681 --> 24:37.424
I know you can't make it right away,
but promise me one thing.

24:37.559 --> 24:42.474
Quit that job
when our baby is born.

24:42.564 --> 24:45.180
Captain!
The dogs have sniffed us out!

24:48.904 --> 24:51.441
Ahab, what are
you waiting for? Go!

24:51.448 --> 24:53.734
Captain! It's now or never!

24:56.495 --> 25:00.704
Ji-su, I understand
what you're saying.

25:00.708 --> 25:05.327
I'll head there right
after the op.,

25:05.504 --> 25:06.994
let's talk then, okay?

25:07.423 --> 25:09.334
Hello? Hello?

25:12.177 --> 25:13.508
Goddammit...

25:14.263 --> 25:15.594
Gerald, go!

25:15.723 --> 25:16.838
Let's go! Go!

25:28.861 --> 25:29.896
Come on, come on!

26:10.903 --> 26:11.903
Hurry!

26:13.781 --> 26:14.781
Guard him!

26:17.576 --> 26:19.783
Bravo! Now! Now!

26:42.392 --> 26:43.427
Anyone shot?

26:43.685 --> 26:45.471
- No! Captain!
- We're okay!

26:46.021 --> 26:46.726
This is a big one.

26:46.730 --> 26:47.594
No need.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.937
Too much lasagne!!

26:51.652 --> 26:53.392
Good work ladies.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.191
Let's go pop bottles,

26:56.740 --> 26:57.855
get fucked up,

26:58.283 --> 26:59.693
buy some rollies.

27:03.247 --> 27:04.407
Jose,

27:04.790 --> 27:05.745
great job!

27:05.749 --> 27:08.161
I told you we're gonna be fine!

27:08.377 --> 27:11.210
Gracias! I did good captain.

27:18.428 --> 27:21.420
Captain! King's ready!

27:25.561 --> 27:28.644
Station 1-0, target acquired.
Please confirm.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.434
Confirmed.
Vital sign's coming in now.

27:31.441 --> 27:32.977
Pulse and blood pressure's stable.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.401
An official statement will
be released shortly.

27:36.530 --> 27:37.690
Evac immediately. Copy?

27:40.409 --> 27:41.615
What about the rest?

27:42.703 --> 27:44.068
Only king comes.

27:52.588 --> 27:53.828
I got this.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.838
Hey, are you sure lad?

27:57.718 --> 28:00.630
Because you just might see
their faces in your nightmares.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.640
Let's finish this and go home.

28:17.988 --> 28:19.774
I told you to confirm
your fucking kills!

28:19.781 --> 28:21.817
Captain, he's losing blood fast!

28:24.453 --> 28:25.943
Captain, he's bleeding out fast!

28:26.038 --> 28:27.528
He's hit on the neck.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.825
I don't fucking believe this...

28:31.168 --> 28:33.625
Mac, there are medics
in the backup team, right?

28:33.754 --> 28:34.664
We need them asap.

28:34.755 --> 28:37.667
I told you to evac, they'll make
the announcement any minute now.

28:38.759 --> 28:41.000
You said they can get here
in 5 minutes, you can spare...

28:41.011 --> 28:42.922
Don't you pull this on me, ahab!

28:42.930 --> 28:44.921
You wanna wait and split the reward
with the backup team?

28:44.932 --> 28:47.423
Stop messing around and
get to the extraction point!

28:49.686 --> 28:51.472
You're fine, you're fine,
you're fine...

28:52.564 --> 28:53.679
Shit!

28:54.691 --> 28:56.682
He's not gonna make it anyway.
We got to go now.

28:56.693 --> 28:58.024
Shut the fuck up!

28:58.445 --> 29:01.236
Captain,
I know what you're thinking,

29:01.365 --> 29:03.321
and you believe this is
the best way.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.239
But we have got to save him.

29:12.876 --> 29:13.876
Shit...

29:19.841 --> 29:21.797
Okay, okay...

29:23.428 --> 29:24.964
Everyone move out.

29:25.347 --> 29:27.838
Logan, no medevac today.
Help Markus with king.

29:27.849 --> 29:28.304
Captain!

29:28.308 --> 29:29.889
We can still save him
if we request medevac!

29:29.893 --> 29:31.599
Just fucking go!

29:32.646 --> 29:33.761
The fuck are you looking at?

29:33.772 --> 29:35.512
Move! Move!

29:38.443 --> 29:39.899
Why isn't anyone helping?

29:40.070 --> 29:41.731
Aren't we a team?

29:42.155 --> 29:43.065
Captain!

29:43.156 --> 29:44.817
Captain, he's still breathing!

29:44.825 --> 29:47.487
If you request medevac
we can get him out of here alive!

29:51.790 --> 29:52.825
Captain!

29:53.083 --> 29:53.788
Captain,

29:53.792 --> 29:55.703
if you request medevac
we can get him out of here!

29:55.711 --> 29:56.917
Stop it!

29:57.713 --> 30:01.922
Assholes like us, we got no
insurance, unlike you!

30:02.509 --> 30:05.421
Even if we get him out of here,
he'll die on the hospital steps,

30:05.429 --> 30:07.169
and when they find out
he's illegal,

30:07.180 --> 30:09.887
they'll come after us
and even our families.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.761
You got to face the reality.

30:12.936 --> 30:16.019
We are actually helping him
by leaving him here.

30:17.899 --> 30:18.979
Fucking move!

30:20.277 --> 30:21.983
What a twisted logic.

30:22.821 --> 30:23.856
Hey, southie!

30:24.323 --> 30:26.860
You just don't want to
split the reward, no?

30:26.950 --> 30:28.030
Wait!

30:28.201 --> 30:29.941
Hey! Let me tell you something.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.951
The reason your captain
didn't call backup is

30:31.955 --> 30:33.946
because he did not want to
share the reward...

30:36.501 --> 30:37.832
Who the fuck are you?

30:38.754 --> 30:44.124
You yankee sellout,
can't you see what's going on?

30:47.804 --> 30:48.668
Say what?

30:48.680 --> 30:51.137
Go ahead, shoot.

30:52.976 --> 30:54.637
We're all dead anyway.

30:55.937 --> 30:57.928
What the hell are you talking about?

30:58.231 --> 30:59.991
Do you think we're here
on our own free will?

31:01.068 --> 31:03.275
We were kidnapped this morning.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.394
If you don't want to die,

31:06.907 --> 31:08.613
then call reinforcement.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.818
This is a trap.

31:13.580 --> 31:16.663
Captain! We've been exposed.

31:16.750 --> 31:19.867
Yet more shocking news
from the Korean peninsula.

31:19.878 --> 31:24.292
An emergency report from North Korea's
chosun central TV states

31:24.299 --> 31:27.883
that mercenaries hired by the CIA
have killed the n. Korean leader,

31:27.886 --> 31:31.128
also known as 'king,
10 hours ago.

31:32.307 --> 31:36.095
Reports say the mercenaries were
subdued by n. Korean soldiers.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.934
What the hell...

31:38.605 --> 31:40.766
Mercs are waiting nearby.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.267
They'll strike at any moment.

31:42.359 --> 31:43.690
Motherfuckers!

31:43.902 --> 31:46.735
If we stay here,
we're gonna end up like them.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.153
We have to do something!

31:48.281 --> 31:52.615
Captain, we have enough c4.
We can block the enemy's path.

31:56.039 --> 31:57.995
Okay, okay, Gerald, you go!

31:58.375 --> 31:59.375
Go!

32:11.388 --> 32:16.382
It is still unclear if the CIA was
responsible for this covert operation.

32:16.518 --> 32:20.477
However, n. Korea's reprisal
has already been set in motion.

32:30.157 --> 32:31.943
According to n. Korea,

32:31.950 --> 32:35.192
this is their reason for firing
a scud missile earlier today

32:35.203 --> 32:38.661
and it is just the start
of their planned retribution.

32:38.957 --> 32:43.542
In one hour, the bodies of
these mercenaries, plus king,

32:43.545 --> 32:48.130
will be displayed as proof of
the insurgency against n. Korea.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.678
Everyone get down!

33:04.900 --> 33:06.765
There are incoming hostiles!

33:06.902 --> 33:09.814
It does not look good!
They outnumber us!

33:10.363 --> 33:11.603
I repeat,

33:11.740 --> 33:16.575
n. Korea has declared that
they're planning a nuclear attack.

33:23.627 --> 33:25.624
Markus, Markus!

33:25.712 --> 33:26.997
Move out!

33:27.047 --> 33:35.047
Yo, intern, shoot them
and then catch up!

34:18.764 --> 34:19.800
Did you take them out?

34:19.808 --> 34:21.092
Come on, this way.

34:34.489 --> 34:37.196
Jp! Stay low! We'll get you out!

34:37.742 --> 34:38.947
Logan, no, no.

34:39.703 --> 34:40.112
Mac!

34:40.120 --> 34:43.032
No, raptor 1-6,
get king out first!

34:43.998 --> 34:44.737
What about my team?

34:44.748 --> 34:46.239
Backup's on the way for them!

34:49.045 --> 34:52.161
Mac! We're sitting ducks in here!
We need backup, right now!

34:52.172 --> 34:54.960
King first! Go!

34:58.722 --> 35:00.087
Jp is down!

35:10.025 --> 35:12.516
Cap! We got to evac!

35:12.611 --> 35:14.977
Captain! You've got to leave!

35:15.071 --> 35:17.858
If the king is dead,
there will be no backup!

35:19.242 --> 35:22.234
Logan, you go!
You go get king! Now!

35:22.412 --> 35:23.993
Set up c4, set up c4!

35:24.080 --> 35:25.820
Gerald, the backup's on the way!

35:26.041 --> 35:28.999
They don't reward the dead!
So don't fucking die on me!

35:31.129 --> 35:31.538
Go!

35:31.630 --> 35:32.836
Let's go!

35:33.089 --> 35:34.704
Come on, come on!

35:36.134 --> 35:38.295
Mac!
Who the fuck are those guys?

35:38.386 --> 35:40.877
They're company-sized
with heavy firepower.

35:41.056 --> 35:42.887
They're here on a full
fucking mission!

35:42.974 --> 35:44.930
A pmc called first service.

35:44.934 --> 35:48.893
Unofficial, unapproved by the union,
but China recently acquired them.

35:49.773 --> 35:51.479
Move it, move it! Move it!

35:51.566 --> 35:53.898
So China's trying to get
n. Korea first?!

35:54.027 --> 35:55.233
China's using king as bait,

35:55.236 --> 35:58.399
which means they already have
control of the north.

35:59.115 --> 36:02.027
The issue now is cause.

36:02.285 --> 36:04.116
N. Korea has said that
they will fire a nuke,

36:04.120 --> 36:07.203
but China has control
of their arsenal.

36:07.207 --> 36:09.949
So they'll fire the nuke
under the guise of n. Korea,

36:09.959 --> 36:12.450
and the country that
shoots it down will be...

36:12.462 --> 36:13.326
- China.
- China.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.078
Because they're the ones
who launched it.

36:15.090 --> 36:18.674
Yes, n. Korea fires a nuke
because of the U.S.'s mistake,

36:18.677 --> 36:21.259
and China intercepts,
plays the hero,

36:21.262 --> 36:23.844
and uses that as an excuse to
take over n. Korea.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.634
And the only way to turn
the tables

36:25.642 --> 36:27.883
is king. Alive.

36:28.103 --> 36:30.810
Captain, c4 in position!
Fire in the hole!

36:31.898 --> 36:33.934
- Pull back!
- Move!

36:35.860 --> 36:38.772
Okay, leave your team to backup
and get to the extraction point.

36:39.239 --> 36:41.275
I'm sorry! It's all my fault!

36:41.282 --> 36:42.442
It's not your fault.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.486
Leave everything and
grab the truck keys now!

36:44.577 --> 36:46.033
Truck keys, truck keys...

36:54.087 --> 36:56.043
Raptor 1-6! What just happened?

36:59.801 --> 37:01.041
Shut it off.

37:01.344 --> 37:02.174
What the fuck's going on?

37:02.178 --> 37:03.338
What happened?!

37:03.346 --> 37:05.052
Shut off that fucking radio.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.968
Raptor 1-6, sitrep!
What's your status?

37:08.184 --> 37:09.845
Raptor 1-6, ahab...

37:10.145 --> 37:13.345
Rap... fuck...
That shit too. Come on!

37:24.284 --> 37:26.946
I thought I was gonna have
a heart attack, you know?

37:27.495 --> 37:29.076
That was intense!

37:31.791 --> 37:34.783
Look. This is our location,
and this is a b-21 bomber.

37:34.794 --> 37:36.750
It's been waiting for 2 hours.

37:39.549 --> 37:40.880
Do you get it?

37:44.554 --> 37:48.217
Why do you think that woman,
she sent us here?

37:48.224 --> 37:50.215
Why didn't she send military?

37:53.396 --> 37:55.682
She never wanted the general.

37:56.191 --> 37:58.523
She just wanted our coordinates.
And then boom!

37:58.651 --> 38:01.393
All the evidence goes up
in smoke.

38:01.529 --> 38:03.645
Even if we bring her king,
you think that,

38:03.656 --> 38:05.442
she's gonna keep us alive?

38:07.327 --> 38:10.694
No, she'll kill us
because we know everything.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.370
Where'd you get that intel?

38:18.463 --> 38:21.250
They contacted me
a few days ago, all right?

38:21.841 --> 38:24.002
Promised a big reward for king.

38:24.344 --> 38:26.505
We can split it 50/50.

38:30.099 --> 38:32.215
You mean,
the same guys out there?

38:33.645 --> 38:38.264
That's exactly what I asked you
2 years ago when you offered me this job.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.270
Let's keep it logical, yeah?

38:45.824 --> 38:46.939
Right?

38:50.411 --> 38:51.651
All right.

38:53.414 --> 38:56.577
This company is offering us
double the salary,

38:56.584 --> 38:59.200
benefits, plus citizenship.

38:59.295 --> 39:03.004
Once this blows over,
we take king to them,

39:03.466 --> 39:06.003
and then clean our hands
of everything.

39:13.309 --> 39:17.143
And waterboarding
will make this guy talk.

39:17.230 --> 39:20.313
His secret slush fund
is full of money.

39:21.067 --> 39:24.275
If I just disappear,
what about my wife?

39:24.779 --> 39:27.441
When you get out of here,
you call her,

39:27.448 --> 39:30.155
tell her to go to the airport.

39:30.243 --> 39:32.484
I mean fuck Philly.
You said it yourself,

39:32.495 --> 39:35.407
you said it's too dangerous
to raise a kid there anyway.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.159
No, no fucking way.

39:38.710 --> 39:39.415
What?

39:39.502 --> 39:42.335
She catches a flight today,
everything's fine.

39:42.338 --> 39:44.624
She's giving birth as we speak!

39:44.883 --> 39:46.089
Markus,

39:46.509 --> 39:48.340
this is fucking crazy!

39:48.678 --> 39:52.546
If we take off,
how fucking romantic...

39:55.351 --> 39:56.511
What?

39:58.021 --> 40:01.684
You're gonna say that if we take off,
that they're all gonna die?

40:02.442 --> 40:04.933
You're not yourself today.

40:04.944 --> 40:08.027
It's every man for himself.
That's what you said.

40:08.114 --> 40:10.105
Earlier, you said that, yeah?

40:11.492 --> 40:13.107
Now listen to me.

40:14.704 --> 40:16.865
Are you coming with me?

40:17.874 --> 40:19.330
Or are you not?

40:20.710 --> 40:25.124
Markus, come have a seat.
And let's talk.

40:39.771 --> 40:40.806
Okay.

40:41.522 --> 40:43.934
Of course the offered
conditions are good.

40:45.693 --> 40:48.776
But what if they just
take king and kill us?

40:49.906 --> 40:51.692
As far I see it,

40:58.748 --> 41:02.411
Yeah, money's always good.

41:03.544 --> 41:06.411
- But you got to think this...
- King secured.

41:07.548 --> 41:09.334
Any other company?

41:12.220 --> 41:13.505
No other company.

41:33.950 --> 41:34.950
Fuck!

41:35.451 --> 41:38.193
We are mercenaries
who work for money.

41:38.621 --> 41:41.363
What is so fucking special
about teammates?

41:41.416 --> 41:44.123
Huh? Huh?

42:34.302 --> 42:37.419
I knew your crippled ass'd
get you into trouble one day.

42:39.265 --> 42:40.675
Look at you.

42:41.684 --> 42:43.549
This is your choice,

42:45.563 --> 42:46.769
not mine.

43:00.578 --> 43:01.613
Son of a bitch...

43:06.334 --> 43:08.040
Logan! Are you all right?

43:11.672 --> 43:13.162
I told you...

43:13.674 --> 43:16.086
It'd save someone
if they got shot.

43:17.637 --> 43:18.717
Okay.

43:19.555 --> 43:22.547
Stay focused, stop the bleeding,

43:22.642 --> 43:24.883
don't fall asleep, you hear?

43:24.977 --> 43:25.977
Yeah.

43:46.958 --> 43:47.958
Shit!

46:16.065 --> 46:18.807
Mac! Do you copy?

46:20.778 --> 46:24.987
King's been hit,
can't evac in current state.

46:25.491 --> 46:27.823
Need reinforcement asap.

46:32.748 --> 46:34.204
For fuck's sake!

46:34.458 --> 46:35.994
Mac, talk to me!

46:36.419 --> 46:39.081
Were you really planning
to leave us all here to die?

46:47.638 --> 46:48.923
Goddammit...

46:51.767 --> 46:52.882
Do you hear me?

46:54.061 --> 46:56.552
Raptor 1-6! Do you hear me?

46:56.731 --> 47:00.895
There're too many hostiles,
we cannot return to the base camp!

47:01.068 --> 47:02.649
We need backup!

47:03.404 --> 47:04.484
Gerald.

47:05.239 --> 47:07.150
Markus sold us out.

47:07.992 --> 47:09.152
Logan and I are shot.

47:09.160 --> 47:11.867
What? How bad are you hit?

47:13.956 --> 47:15.036
King's dead.

47:15.583 --> 47:19.075
A b-21 is on standby
to bomb this place!

47:19.712 --> 47:22.454
Ahab, calm down, okay?

47:22.882 --> 47:24.873
Breathe. Okay.

47:25.217 --> 47:26.377
Breathe.

47:29.555 --> 47:31.295
It's fine, it's fine...

47:31.390 --> 47:33.756
How long has the king been dead?

47:33.851 --> 47:36.012
Hard to say, 5 minutes, maybe.

47:36.312 --> 47:37.312
Wart!

47:37.521 --> 47:40.638
Then they should've
bombed us already, right?

47:53.329 --> 47:54.444
Wait.

48:06.926 --> 48:08.416
He's still alivel

48:10.096 --> 48:12.212
that's why
they haven't bombed us!

48:13.432 --> 48:15.263
They got to get king
no matter what.

48:15.518 --> 48:18.635
If we keep him alive,
they'll have to send reinforcement!

48:18.896 --> 48:20.727
But we are not a doctor.

48:20.731 --> 48:23.143
How are we supposed to
get him from here?

48:23.275 --> 48:24.105
Gerald,

48:24.193 --> 48:26.605
the head doctor was
among the hostages, right?

48:26.904 --> 48:27.984
Let's find him!

48:28.656 --> 48:30.863
Watch us get the fuck out of here.

48:31.242 --> 48:33.233
Logan!
Slide me the first aid kit!

48:34.578 --> 48:36.193
Let's get out of here...

48:36.539 --> 48:37.403
Logan!

48:37.498 --> 48:38.863
Captain! Here!

48:51.470 --> 48:56.931
Captain! The doctor is long gone.
It is impossible for us to find them.

48:57.726 --> 48:58.886
Fuck!

49:02.022 --> 49:04.855
Pedro,
what's the situation there?

49:04.859 --> 49:09.319
Captain, we're behind enemy lines,
we can't regroup.

49:29.675 --> 49:31.006
Pedro, you heard me, right?

49:32.011 --> 49:34.753
The doctor might be near you.
Find him, hurry!

49:36.974 --> 49:38.214
We got movement!

50:03.000 --> 50:05.036
We got to get them! Hurry!
Hurry the fuck up!

50:10.549 --> 50:12.380
Dr. yoon, come!

50:12.510 --> 50:13.545
You go on ahead!

50:14.053 --> 50:15.463
What is he doing?

50:17.431 --> 50:19.342
Hey! Don't fucking move!

50:19.350 --> 50:21.090
- On the floor! Get on the floor!
- Put your fucking hands up!

50:21.101 --> 50:23.137
Did you hear me?
Hey, you fucking hear me?

50:23.145 --> 50:24.635
I said put your
fucking hands up!

50:24.855 --> 50:26.971
What the fuck is up?
Bullshit! Fuck you!

50:26.982 --> 50:29.598
Get the fucking hads up
when I tell you, fucking malparido!

50:29.735 --> 50:32.647
You know, I'll fucking kill you!
You hear me? I'll fucking kill you.

50:35.991 --> 50:38.232
Hold that fucker down
and put the doctor on.

50:38.953 --> 50:40.159
Don't fucking move.

50:42.039 --> 50:43.039
He's dead.

50:44.041 --> 50:44.621
Fuck!

50:44.625 --> 50:48.538
Raptor 1-6.
We'll clean up here, we join you.

50:51.590 --> 50:54.081
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

50:58.597 --> 51:00.337
That's a fucking doctor. Nelson.

51:00.432 --> 51:02.468
Put an earpiece on him
and show him the monitor!

51:02.601 --> 51:04.011
Come on, get up! Get up!

51:04.019 --> 51:05.884
On your knees, gonorrhea.
Come on!

51:09.483 --> 51:11.815
Take this, it's my captain.

51:15.823 --> 51:17.654
Don't look at me.
Fucking put your head down!

51:17.658 --> 51:18.647
Head down! Gonorrhea!

51:18.659 --> 51:20.115
Yo, northie, can you hear me?

51:21.203 --> 51:22.033
King's been shot.

51:22.037 --> 51:24.119
With a 9mm from 5m distance.

51:25.124 --> 51:30.118
And this red screen
has to turn green.

51:30.212 --> 51:32.794
Look at the screen
and tell me what to do.

51:32.923 --> 51:34.288
And if I revive him?

51:35.384 --> 51:37.090
You're gonna shoot us, no?

51:39.054 --> 51:40.669
If king lives, you live.

51:41.432 --> 51:42.968
How can I trust you?

51:43.225 --> 51:44.965
You toss your comrades
after using them.

51:47.896 --> 51:48.976
They're coming.

52:05.205 --> 52:06.661
Let's just go, forget them.

52:06.665 --> 52:08.075
- Cover them!
- You're going to get us killed.

52:08.083 --> 52:10.074
- We finish this!
- If you shoot,

52:10.085 --> 52:11.791
find and kill us.

52:12.087 --> 52:14.123
Let's just go
our separate ways, okay?

52:23.390 --> 52:25.005
Pedro, get your knife.

52:26.185 --> 52:28.141
Why do you listen to this guy?

52:28.395 --> 52:30.477
Do you think he'd save you
if you were shot?

52:30.481 --> 52:32.267
How you stopped to
save that old man?

52:32.399 --> 52:33.935
That's stupid,

52:34.109 --> 52:37.226
leaving the shot man
stops more from being shot.

53:04.139 --> 53:05.879
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

53:10.270 --> 53:12.682
No, no, no, no!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

53:16.276 --> 53:17.391
Fuck!

53:18.278 --> 53:21.236
5 armed hostiles,
10 seconds out!

53:26.662 --> 53:30.530
Captain, what we do, captain?
What we do?

53:36.797 --> 53:40.631
I'll treat king,
so give us guns.

53:40.926 --> 53:41.665
What?!

53:41.677 --> 53:43.588
We got to fight together
to survive. Hurry!

53:59.361 --> 54:00.942
Nelson, Pedro, give them guns!

54:00.946 --> 54:02.436
Captain,
we can't trust these guys.

54:02.448 --> 54:03.984
That's a fucking order!

54:13.417 --> 54:15.282
Cono! Here, fucking take it!

54:15.377 --> 54:17.208
Go! Go! Come on! Go!

54:23.385 --> 54:26.297
It's cardiac tamponade caused by
internal bleeding.

54:26.972 --> 54:29.714
Stop cpr, drain the pooled blood
inside the pericardium.

54:30.184 --> 54:33.176
See the pericardial tap
inside the first aid?

54:46.325 --> 54:48.441
No, not that, it's on the top!

54:48.744 --> 54:50.359
On top, it's a syringe!

54:51.747 --> 54:52.281
This?

54:52.289 --> 54:53.620
Yes, that one!

54:54.583 --> 54:57.791
Be careful, you got 3 minutes
before he's brain dead.

55:03.342 --> 55:06.960
Captain, we secured an escape route!
We got to move!

55:07.054 --> 55:08.385
Pedro, lay down cover.

55:08.388 --> 55:10.470
Rest of you, retreat through
the back door.

55:12.226 --> 55:14.558
Hey! Come on! Come on! Come on!

55:16.980 --> 55:18.436
Go, go! Move out!

55:29.660 --> 55:31.651
Go in under the left,
fourth rib.

55:31.787 --> 55:33.652
Insert and drain the blood.

55:34.039 --> 55:35.039
Which rib?

55:35.082 --> 55:37.869
4th from the bottom,
just below that!

55:38.210 --> 55:40.576
Herel - no, the opposite side!

55:42.631 --> 55:43.416
Here?

55:43.423 --> 55:44.629
Yes, there, insert!

55:47.135 --> 55:49.217
Hey! Get on with it!
Just insert!

55:51.807 --> 55:55.516
Pull the plunger slightly,
liguid will fill up.

55:57.229 --> 56:00.096
Yes, good, you're doing well!

56:00.691 --> 56:01.601
I think I got it.

56:01.608 --> 56:04.224
No, not yet, just a bit more.

56:04.278 --> 56:06.269
- How much more?
- About 50cc.

56:09.157 --> 56:11.273
Slowly and steady.

56:11.994 --> 56:12.449
I think it's enough.

56:12.452 --> 56:14.192
- Good! Next!
- Done?

56:15.080 --> 56:16.320
Can you spot a vein?

56:16.748 --> 56:20.161
Give him saline solution
and perform cpr!

56:22.838 --> 56:24.954
What're you doing? Hurry!

56:25.424 --> 56:27.506
Damn about slowly and steady.

56:36.894 --> 56:39.351
Connect saline... Cpr now!

56:41.023 --> 56:44.686
Raptor 1-6, enemy at our 12!
We're boxed in!

56:44.776 --> 56:47.188
Go to up front! Go to up front!

56:49.114 --> 56:50.900
Carlos, check the rear!

57:03.337 --> 57:06.079
Gerald, the iron door
at your 10 o'clock.

57:06.089 --> 57:07.374
It leads to a staircase.

57:07.507 --> 57:09.714
Marcel, give me the shield!

57:10.302 --> 57:11.838
Dimitri, follow me!

57:28.820 --> 57:29.980
Where's Samir?!

57:30.364 --> 57:31.479
Fuck, he's still out there!

57:39.373 --> 57:41.489
Huh? Shit.

57:41.500 --> 57:42.114
What's wrong?

57:42.125 --> 57:43.661
I think I broke his rib.

57:43.961 --> 57:45.747
Doesn't matter,
saving him is priority!

57:45.837 --> 57:47.543
Don't hesitate, just do it!

57:48.382 --> 57:50.998
Time may be up.

57:51.218 --> 57:52.754
Is he dead already?

57:52.844 --> 57:54.880
Didn't you say if he dies,
we're all dead too?

57:55.222 --> 57:56.758
Just keep doing it!

57:57.224 --> 57:59.010
Samir! Run!

58:05.983 --> 58:07.598
Die, motherfuckers!

58:08.527 --> 58:09.983
Gerald! What're you waiting for?

58:09.987 --> 58:11.727
Throw a grenade
and shut the door!

58:12.489 --> 58:14.275
Gerald, it's too late for me!

58:14.449 --> 58:16.986
I'll go! Gerald I said I'll go!

58:16.994 --> 58:17.994
No!

58:18.161 --> 58:19.492
You want us all to die?

58:19.621 --> 58:21.077
Shut the fucking door!

58:32.926 --> 58:36.384
The door! Top of the stairs! Go!

58:39.182 --> 58:40.763
Get to the top. Hurry!

58:41.560 --> 58:44.552
Hey, southie, what's wrong?

58:44.563 --> 58:45.563
Can you hear me?!

58:46.314 --> 58:47.314
He's back!

58:48.400 --> 58:49.640
I got a pulse!

58:49.651 --> 58:52.688
Good, but don't celebrate yet,
it'll stop soon again.

58:52.779 --> 58:55.942
See the saline bag?
Start squeezing it!

58:56.450 --> 58:57.485
With my hands?

58:59.536 --> 59:02.243
One, two, three!

59:02.748 --> 59:04.113
Fuck! It's a trap.

59:06.001 --> 59:07.491
Carlos has been hit.

59:07.586 --> 59:10.498
Gerald, we got the doc,
I'm treating king.

59:10.589 --> 59:13.001
Backup will be here.
Hang in there!

59:27.064 --> 59:31.433
Northie! The monitor's yellow,
it changed status!

59:31.693 --> 59:32.693
What's next?

59:32.819 --> 59:35.276
Yo, northie! What's next?

59:40.911 --> 59:42.572
Blood transfusion! Type o!

59:45.290 --> 59:47.030
Transfusion, wait a minute...

59:56.551 --> 59:58.041
Fuck, it's no use.

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:10.892
Captain! You got to do something!

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:13.686
We're all gonna die down here!

01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:15.164
Logan!

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:20.792
Logan! Are you okay?

01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:24.385
Wake up! Don't fall asleep!

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:28.762
Don't make me talk...
It hurts too much.

01:01:28.894 --> 01:01:30.509
Come over here.

01:01:30.729 --> 01:01:32.685
I'll give you
something for the pain.

01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:37.562
I'm fine,
just look after yourself.

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.685
Just do what I say! Hurry!

01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:56.368
Sit here.

01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:01.165
Are you okay?

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.049
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:06.838
Here, makes you feel better.

01:02:14.356 --> 01:02:15.391
Okay...

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:20.525
I don't think
I'm cut out for this.

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:24.737
I want to go home,

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:28.108
see my family,

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:32.408
spend time with my daughter.

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:39.536
What is this stuff?

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.678
What are you doing, captain?

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:52.348
Is he still alive?

01:02:57.399 --> 01:02:58.514
No.

01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:01.016
No, captain.

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:03.192
Captain, wait...

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:08.110
No, no, please.
No, no, cap, no... Logan,

01:03:08.702 --> 01:03:11.444
hold still.
I only need a little.

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:15.868
No, I've lost a lot of blood already.
Captain, I can't. I can't take it...

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:17.075
- Just don't move.
- No, cap...

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:20.494
No, I can't do it.
Captain, please, I can't do it!

01:03:20.839 --> 01:03:22.170
Captain, please!

01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:29.089
Don't do this to Mel

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:32.638
that's okay. Just don't move.
Just don't move.

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:34.140
Just don't move.

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:38.804
Logan, if king dies,
we all fucking die,

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:41.564
and they'll just cover
everything up.

01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:44.818
I don't want to die, captain.

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:46.861
I want to get out of here alive...

01:03:48.116 --> 01:03:49.401
Please...

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:55.529
Logan.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.073
Logan.

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:00.783
I will keep you alive.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:03.495
If you can give just a bit,

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:07.840
we can all
get out of here together.

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.168
Don't worry.

01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:13.346
Just like you did with
that parachute guy, right?

01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:16.700
Station 1-0, come in!

01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:21.410
King's recovering.
Send in reinforcements right now.

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:28.039
Station 1-0? Mac?
Can you see us?

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:30.791
My man is giving
king a blood transfusion.

01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:33.092
Send us medevac. Hurry!

01:05:54.826 --> 01:05:57.192
While the white house
denies involvement,

01:05:57.203 --> 01:06:01.913
we have incoming reports regarding
the man caught on cctv footage.

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:05.124
According to these news reports,
the suspect,

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:07.961
who is thought to have been
killed during the kidnapping,

01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:10.208
uses the codename 'ahab'

01:06:10.341 --> 01:06:15.586
and is an undocumented alien illegally
hired by a private military company...

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:40.781
Alpha 1, requesting sitrep.

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:45.115
Alpha 1, Alpha 1,
requesting sitrep.

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:53.123
Alpha 2, situation contained.
All clear.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.041
Dong-hee, you with me?

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:57.920
Alpha 1, check your
main chute. Alpha 1!

01:06:57.931 --> 01:06:59.592
Dong-hee! Wake up!

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:03.008
Alpha 1, you're falling too fast!
Is everything okay?

01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:08.016
We got a situation.

01:07:08.483 --> 01:07:10.203
Alpha 1, you've exceeded
safe landing speed!

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:12.100
Captain, you got to let him go!

01:07:13.154 --> 01:07:16.396
You could both die!
Let go of him!

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:08.750
Logan,

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:12.999
Logan, Logan?

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:07.301
Nelson!

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:11.055
Can you hear me?

01:09:12.523 --> 01:09:15.060
Gerald? Gerald?

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.229
Gerald...

01:12:14.872 --> 01:12:19.206
Hey, southie, can you hear me?

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.451
Can you see me?

01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:23.036
Hey, southie!

01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:30.676
What happened? What's going on?

01:12:31.264 --> 01:12:32.344
You're still alive?

01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:38.767
What was that bombing?

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.812
What's the chairman's status?

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:47.519
King's fine, how are my men?

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:54.738
Everything's collapsed.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:58.989
Your comrade held on
until just now.

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:09.006
Hey, are you injured?

01:13:09.594 --> 01:13:11.710
What's that wound?
Were you shot?

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:15.171
Put the camera near it,
let me check it out.

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:22.603
What's with your right leg?
Is that prosthetic?

01:13:22.982 --> 01:13:26.440
Come on, what do I do?

01:13:26.611 --> 01:13:27.726
Tell me.

01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:35.950
The bullet could be on
your femoral artery, so go easy.

01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:38.326
If you damage it,
it be a bloodbath.

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:42.248
Use a scalpel
to make an incision

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:43.991
and get the retractor.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.626
Retractor?

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:48.625
It looks like scissors.

01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:50.627
Yeah, that one.

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:53.129
Fasten the wound with it,

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:57.388
insert the tweezers
through the cavity,

01:13:57.475 --> 01:13:58.955
about the length of
your index finger,

01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:01.509
then you're near
the femoral artery.

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:08.315
Okay, that's enough.

01:14:10.488 --> 01:14:14.106
Once you begin extracting,
you'll feel pain.

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:16.486
That's a good thing.

01:14:16.827 --> 01:14:18.783
It means bloods
circulating again.

01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:35.589
Why is a southie doing this
type of work?

01:14:36.263 --> 01:14:37.469
Is it for the money?

01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:46.813
Buddy, I'm not chatty
just for the hell of it.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:50.357
You feel dizzy, right?
Vision's blurry?

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:54.941
It's due to blood loss.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:01.235
Southie,
you need to keep talking.

01:15:01.372 --> 01:15:02.532
Or you'll go into shock.

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:06.617
I got it, I got something!

01:15:06.752 --> 01:15:07.752
Wait, wait!

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:13.539
You tore the artery.

01:15:13.884 --> 01:15:16.421
Cover it for now,
or it'll be dangerous.

01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:18.881
Get proper medical attention

01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:20.091
when you get out of here.

01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:22.966
Fuck you, you mean after
they cut off my damn leg?

01:15:23.978 --> 01:15:25.559
What are you doing?!

01:15:25.563 --> 01:15:27.554
If you take it out,
you'll bleed to death!

01:15:30.151 --> 01:15:32.016
Hey, southie! Can you hear me?

01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:34.654
Hey, southie!

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:36.399
Are you listening?

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:39.614
Hey, southie!

01:15:47.418 --> 01:15:48.453
Do you hear me?

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:50.104
See the compression bandage
and styptic?

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:52.168
Use them, you got to
stop the bleeding.

01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:53.256
Hurry!

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:58.126
Yeah, the duct tape,
wrap it with that!

01:15:58.262 --> 01:16:01.049
Good, take the painkiller.

01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:02.513
Take the shot!

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:05.143
Hurry!

01:16:21.327 --> 01:16:22.942
Are you dumb or just thick?

01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:25.022
Why don't you listen
to the doctor?

01:16:25.956 --> 01:16:28.288
You got a death wish?

01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:30.616
What the hell's wrong with you?

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:48.346
Yo, northie...

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:55.103
6 years ago, I was conducting
an airborne training,

01:16:58.072 --> 01:17:03.863
when a dimwit's parachute failed,
he landed on me mid-jump.

01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:10.911
A single chute couldn't hold
2 people at that speed.

01:17:15.089 --> 01:17:20.334
I knew I'd survive
if I let him go.

01:17:21.011 --> 01:17:23.548
But I couldn't fucking do it.

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:25.053
So,

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:28.970
you held onto him to the end?

01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:36.808
When my men were after you,

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:40.402
you were trying to
save the head doctor.

01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:44.740
You could've left without him.

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:47.910
What were you thinking?

01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:52.455
What are you talking about?

01:17:53.627 --> 01:17:58.121
I'm sure you considered it,
leave him or stay.

01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:05.674
No, you should've left him.

01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:11.809
After I hit the ground...

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:19.105
That asshole ended up dying,
and I lost my leg.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:26.654
Everyone treats me like shit,
but I don't care.

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:34.574
There was no other choice.

01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:39.503
Logan...

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.051
Logan, I'm sorry.

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:53.095
I'm so sorry...

01:18:56.523 --> 01:19:01.768
So let's get out of here,
let's leave, please...

01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:05.153
Hey, southie.

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:09.654
Can't you hear the gunshots?

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:14.572
Your comrades are still fighting,
still believing in you.

01:19:15.209 --> 01:19:19.669
But you're bitching and moaning
because you want to survive alone?

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:28.841
That's why this war started,
everyone's fending for themselves.

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:33.932
Yeah, the thought crossed
my mind.

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:39.722
You asked yourself too,
still doing that now.

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:49.570
Do you need a reason
to save a life?

01:19:50.286 --> 01:19:51.651
No?

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:57.994
Hold steady,
we can get out alive.

01:20:09.555 --> 01:20:11.216
Raptor 1-6!

01:20:11.724 --> 01:20:13.840
- This is Alpha 1-0!
- Gerald.

01:20:13.892 --> 01:20:15.757
- Gerald...
- Come in!

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:18.518
Gerald...

01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:20.012
Raptor 1-6!

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:22.811
I need for you to hear me!

01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:23.818
Gerald...

01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:27.103
What the fuck's this?

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:29.817
Ahab, are you looking alive?

01:20:30.909 --> 01:20:31.898
I need for you to hear me!

01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:36.449
Gerald, it's me.
What's your situation?

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:41.785
Carlos is dead.
There are only 4 of us left.

01:20:43.714 --> 01:20:46.581
We cannot last much longer.

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:54.630
Gerald, ammo?

01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:57.891
Without reinforcements,
3 minutes, tops.

01:21:21.502 --> 01:21:24.960
Logan, you were right.

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.626
We can save everyone.

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:40.556
Gerald, did you pack
the night vision goggles?

01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:42.511
You said we didn't need them.

01:21:42.606 --> 01:21:44.267
Of course, I packed them.

01:21:45.859 --> 01:21:47.895
Are we going home today, captain?

01:21:48.028 --> 01:21:51.270
Be ready.
I'll find you an escape route.

01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:52.525
Copy that!

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:26.142
Yo, northie!

01:22:26.150 --> 01:22:27.640
Talk to me.

01:22:29.027 --> 01:22:30.767
I need your help.

01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:34.529
With your help,
we can all get out alive.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:37.362
I'll get reinforcement
no matter what,

01:22:38.078 --> 01:22:43.163
you go to the control room
and turn off the lights in b2, c13.

01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:46.159
When they're off,
my team will escape,

01:22:46.253 --> 01:22:48.289
and you can exfil
with them, got that?

01:22:48.755 --> 01:22:50.416
Just tell me where to go.

01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:54.546
Are you alright?

01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:55.884
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:22:56.221 --> 01:22:58.132
You see that opening behind you?

01:22:58.557 --> 01:23:02.015
You got to go down a level,
it's the last room on the left.

01:23:02.019 --> 01:23:03.019
I got it!

01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:04.729
Follow me.

01:23:29.922 --> 01:23:30.922
Mac?

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:32.379
You're alive!

01:23:32.382 --> 01:23:34.794
I'm fucking alive,
no thanks to you

01:23:35.135 --> 01:23:36.124
you bombed us!

01:23:36.136 --> 01:23:38.502
We don't have much time,
so I'll be brief

01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:40.550
you knew king was alive!

01:23:41.058 --> 01:23:41.968
Why'd you bomb us?

01:23:41.975 --> 01:23:43.465
This phone, we've only got
a couple of minutes

01:23:43.477 --> 01:23:45.684
answer my fucking question!

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:47.932
Why'd you bomb us?

01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:50.931
Did you really want to
kill us all?

01:23:54.947 --> 01:23:55.982
Yes.

01:23:56.114 --> 01:24:01.234
We tried to bury your team, king,
and all the evidence in the bunkers

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:03.781
so we could deny China's claim.

01:24:04.122 --> 01:24:06.488
But it didn't work,
the public is not buying it.

01:24:19.805 --> 01:24:22.467
Mac, okay.

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:24.180
Mac.

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:26.725
I promise.

01:24:27.396 --> 01:24:29.182
We heard and saw nothing.

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:31.146
Just send backup
and more guns...

01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:33.231
McGregor's already ordered
a second bombing.

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:36.317
He'll get rid of the evidence
no matter what.

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:39.738
After they re-load,
we'll have only 15 minutes.

01:24:40.117 --> 01:24:43.985
And my command's been stripped.
I can't give official orders.

01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:46.237
Agent MacKenzie, you no longer
have authority here.

01:24:46.248 --> 01:24:47.579
Get your hands off me!

01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:48.993
- I can walk out of here on my own.
- Mac?

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:50.912
Protocol dictates we'll take
that phone.

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:53.126
Captain,
I'm down to my last mag!

01:24:55.048 --> 01:24:56.208
Northie, did you find it?

01:24:56.216 --> 01:24:58.002
Not yet!

01:24:58.885 --> 01:24:59.885
Listen, ahab.

01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:02.003
I am not walking away from this.

01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:04.679
From now on, if you do as I say,

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:07.140
there is a way
through this for us.

01:25:08.228 --> 01:25:09.013
Not just you?

01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:11.637
Both of us, I didn't need
you before, but I do now.

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:14.105
You've seen your face
all over the news, right?

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:16.350
As the suspect
for king's murder, right?

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:18.939
If you walk
out of there with him,

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:20.483
that changes everything.

01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:22.151
I'll take you to the press.

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:25.651
Okay.

01:25:25.996 --> 01:25:28.738
So the story
is we were sent to rescue king,

01:25:28.749 --> 01:25:29.864
but we were ambushed...

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:33.208
The white house didn't abandon you,
they rescued you in the end.

01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:39.335
I think 'used' is
the more precise word.

01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:41.925
Whatever the word,
if you do this,

01:25:41.928 --> 01:25:44.340
we'll flip public opinion,
I'll get McGregor re-elected,

01:25:44.348 --> 01:25:46.259
and you'll get out of
there alive.

01:25:49.436 --> 01:25:51.017
It's a win-win.

01:25:53.065 --> 01:25:54.930
Southie, I found it!

01:25:57.944 --> 01:25:59.980
Gerald, we're pulling out.

01:26:00.113 --> 01:26:01.148
Good to go, cap.

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:05.991
Yo, northie, switch it off!

01:26:06.203 --> 01:26:07.203
Now!

01:26:34.564 --> 01:26:36.555
Northie, turn right outside,

01:26:36.566 --> 01:26:38.306
and go straight,
you'll join my men.

01:26:38.318 --> 01:26:39.318
Got it.

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:42.602
What's eta on reinforcements?

01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:44.479
How's king?
I can't see his vitals.

01:26:44.574 --> 01:26:48.317
Ballistic trauma to the chest,
but the n. Korean doctor saved him.

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:54.243
Yo, northie! Your other right!

01:26:55.168 --> 01:26:57.705
The blood bags, king can't
make it without them!

01:27:04.344 --> 01:27:08.257
Mac, we are running out of time.
We need those reinforcements right now.

01:27:08.265 --> 01:27:09.721
I'll convince McGregor
no matter what.

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:12.432
You just keep king alive until
backup gets there.

01:27:12.436 --> 01:27:14.347
They'll bring you out with him.

01:27:16.481 --> 01:27:18.096
No, no, wait, wait!

01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:20.394
Mac, what about my men
and the doc?

01:27:20.402 --> 01:27:24.270
What took place can never
reach the outside world.

01:27:24.406 --> 01:27:27.193
The reinforcements will
eliminate your men.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.361
You can take care of
the doctor yourself.

01:27:29.494 --> 01:27:32.361
And when you get out,
you will have an interview with the press.

01:27:32.372 --> 01:27:35.079
For the sake of appearances,
we'll make you an American citizen.

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:37.578
There will be new documents...
Mac,

01:27:38.336 --> 01:27:39.917
I'm not coming alone.

01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:43.255
We're fighting through hell
to get out of here alive together...

01:27:51.892 --> 01:27:54.258
I don't fucking believe this...

01:27:57.272 --> 01:28:00.309
Hey, southie! Check these out!

01:28:02.194 --> 01:28:04.856
I was afraid there wouldn't be any,
but we're in luck.

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:08.146
Fine. Grab them and leave.

01:28:08.241 --> 01:28:10.232
Okay, see you soon.

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:27.340
They're coming, hide!

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:34.347
Team 13 beginning
dispensary sweep.

01:29:02.295 --> 01:29:03.330
Yo, northie.

01:29:03.547 --> 01:29:04.627
Grab that gun.

01:29:05.382 --> 01:29:06.382
Grab it.

01:29:06.466 --> 01:29:08.798
Don't think and shoot. Hurry!

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:19.718
Wait!

01:29:21.273 --> 01:29:23.389
The clip's empty.
Look through the mag holder.

01:29:23.483 --> 01:29:24.939
There may be more.

01:29:52.762 --> 01:29:54.343
Hurry, hurry!

01:29:55.265 --> 01:29:56.265
Hurry up!

01:30:05.442 --> 01:30:08.400
Put it down, now! Drop the gun!

01:30:08.737 --> 01:30:09.943
All right, hands up!

01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:11.065
Fucking get out!

01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:12.483
Get the fuck out of there!

01:30:12.490 --> 01:30:13.490
Move!

01:30:14.034 --> 01:30:16.446
Get the fuck up! Move!

01:30:18.872 --> 01:30:21.113
This is team 1-3,
we found someone here.

01:30:21.458 --> 01:30:22.538
We'll take care of him.

01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:26.118
Wait! His badge. He's a medic.

01:30:26.755 --> 01:30:29.588
Where's king?
And the raptor 1-6 captain?

01:30:29.591 --> 01:30:30.922
Are they together?

01:30:31.009 --> 01:30:33.375
Trust me, if you don't talk,
he can't shoot you.

01:30:33.386 --> 01:30:36.344
Tell me where they are,
and we'll protect you.

01:30:36.389 --> 01:30:38.801
Do not say anything.

01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:40.765
Don't.

01:30:44.522 --> 01:30:46.387
How can I trust you?

01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:52.356
Go first. I'll handle this.

01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:53.524
Come on.

01:30:54.783 --> 01:30:59.026
Without those blood bags,
we're all dead.

01:30:59.537 --> 01:31:01.152
Here. Take my gun.

01:31:02.499 --> 01:31:05.241
I'll send my men,
buy us some time.

01:31:14.469 --> 01:31:16.710
We didn't know you're a doctor.

01:31:16.888 --> 01:31:18.628
Hello, I'm yi-hyun choi,

01:31:20.517 --> 01:31:22.599
relax, don't be alarmed.

01:31:23.812 --> 01:31:26.098
We're not after you,

01:31:26.106 --> 01:31:28.267
we just want
king and the captain.

01:31:28.525 --> 01:31:30.390
Where is he?

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:35.812
Did he say
you can all get out alive?

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:39.316
That's what he always says.

01:31:45.583 --> 01:31:47.448
How do you know that?

01:31:57.262 --> 01:32:00.675
Raptor 1-6, I was one of them.

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:03.715
Don't trust him.

01:32:04.227 --> 01:32:06.434
He's only up for the money.

01:32:08.523 --> 01:32:11.515
His team won't get out alive.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:18.651
Tell me where he is,
and I'll let you out of here.

01:32:26.416 --> 01:32:30.580
If I tell you, I'll live?

01:32:31.713 --> 01:32:32.873
Of course.

01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:46.947
Where do I go?

01:33:52.544 --> 01:33:55.126
It's not too far, follow me.

01:33:57.549 --> 01:34:01.167
Wait, don't shoot.
I wasn't going to kill you!

01:34:04.681 --> 01:34:08.173
Stop the bleeding.
We can all get out alive.

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:24.238
Raptor 1-6!
We've reached the d sector.

01:34:25.869 --> 01:34:27.779
Gerald, two more corners,

01:34:27.787 --> 01:34:30.449
you'll find a staircase right
before the venue entrance.

01:34:30.456 --> 01:34:32.663
The doc will be there.
Bring him out with you.

01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:33.910
Roger that!

01:34:35.587 --> 01:34:36.793
This way.

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:01.813
Get down! Ambush!

01:35:05.909 --> 01:35:07.774
Engaging! 5 hostiles!

01:35:23.635 --> 01:35:26.217
Shit, no ammo! No ammo!

01:35:26.429 --> 01:35:30.672
Captain, we need a way behind them!
Let me know!

01:35:34.354 --> 01:35:35.434
Follow me.

01:35:36.022 --> 01:35:37.432
Bao. Cover me,

01:35:54.249 --> 01:35:56.706
We are engaging four enemy
mercenaries at the main tunnel.

01:35:57.752 --> 01:36:00.835
In pursuit of a north Korean doctor.
We will kill him on site.

01:36:57.687 --> 01:36:58.847
Let's go home!

01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:04.860
Gerald, hurry!

01:37:25.173 --> 01:37:28.006
Captain! We're at the stairs.
Where's the doctor?

01:37:28.009 --> 01:37:29.920
Wait, wait! He's coming!

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:34.296
Northie, take a right
and you'll see a staircase!

01:37:34.557 --> 01:37:36.422
Go down and you'll reach my men.

01:37:36.601 --> 01:37:38.557
Turn right, staircase. Gotcha.

01:38:08.966 --> 01:38:10.831
Gerald, doc's path is blocked.

01:38:10.927 --> 01:38:14.215
You'll find extra mags in the venue.
Load up and go back for him.

01:38:14.222 --> 01:38:15.257
Roger that!

01:38:25.191 --> 01:38:26.306
Bao. Go!

01:38:56.389 --> 01:38:59.597
Captain,
we have reached the venue!

01:39:00.893 --> 01:39:03.726
What's the doctor's 207?

01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:07.687
Captain!

01:39:09.944 --> 01:39:11.275
Gerald...

01:39:13.322 --> 01:39:14.858
It's too late.

01:39:15.867 --> 01:39:18.279
We cannot get everyone out.

01:39:22.206 --> 01:39:24.367
You and I can get out of here.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:29.205
I don't...

01:39:30.006 --> 01:39:31.542
I don't want to die in here.

01:39:33.092 --> 01:39:35.048
I don't want to die in here.

01:39:35.928 --> 01:39:37.668
Let me ask you something.

01:39:38.181 --> 01:39:39.967
When the new guy comes,

01:39:40.016 --> 01:39:43.008
you tell the story
about the parachute, right?

01:39:43.936 --> 01:39:46.928
What has always confused me
about the logic is

01:39:48.357 --> 01:39:53.317
you should've let go.
But you did not, right?

01:39:54.030 --> 01:40:00.071
That way you would've landed
with no problem and still had your leg.

01:40:01.454 --> 01:40:03.695
Why did you not let go, ahab?

01:40:05.791 --> 01:40:08.658
Ahab, why did you not let go?

01:40:10.796 --> 01:40:14.038
Because you wanted
to save him, right?

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:17.834
This is my parachute.

01:40:18.137 --> 01:40:20.674
I will no longer let them go!

01:40:28.231 --> 01:40:30.142
That is a fucking tank!

01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:31.149
Dimitri!

01:40:31.734 --> 01:40:32.734
Bao!

01:40:33.027 --> 01:40:33.732
Marcel!

01:40:33.736 --> 01:40:36.352
Raptor 1-6, this is station 1-0.

01:40:37.031 --> 01:40:37.861
Mac?

01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:39.821
Raptor 1-6, do you copy?!

01:40:41.035 --> 01:40:42.946
Raptor 1-6, do you copy?!

01:40:42.995 --> 01:40:45.987
- Mac, I'm here. Can you hear me?
- Ahab, do you copy?!

01:40:46.082 --> 01:40:46.992
I'm here!

01:40:47.041 --> 01:40:50.408
Okay, ahab.
We have McGregor's full support.

01:40:50.503 --> 01:40:53.290
Reinforcements are moving in!
Are you in position?

01:40:53.381 --> 01:40:55.872
Gerald, backup's coming!

01:40:56.259 --> 01:40:59.092
Hang in there
just a little longer...

01:41:03.307 --> 01:41:06.299
Station 1-0, cannot enter
aue to cardiac arrest.

01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:08.141
Immediate response needed,

01:41:08.145 --> 01:41:10.010
ahab, what's happening?

01:41:11.190 --> 01:41:13.431
Ahab! Ahab!

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:34.140
Yo, northie!

01:42:35.316 --> 01:42:36.476
Northiel.

01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:34.121
You were alive, northie.

01:43:39.338 --> 01:43:40.828
Were you hit?!

01:43:43.134 --> 01:43:44.294
It's not me.

01:43:46.011 --> 01:43:47.126
How is he?

01:45:01.253 --> 01:45:02.253
Hey, southie.

01:45:03.422 --> 01:45:07.540
If his blood pressure drops,
give him a shot, okay?

01:45:16.685 --> 01:45:18.095
I'm sick of this.

01:45:18.479 --> 01:45:23.189
If I get out of here,
I'll be a supermarket security.

01:45:23.317 --> 01:45:27.356
Who's going to hire
a crippled security guard?

01:45:31.408 --> 01:45:32.408
Hey, southie.

01:45:33.327 --> 01:45:34.692
Don't worry,

01:45:37.248 --> 01:45:38.704
it's gonna be okay.

01:46:16.328 --> 01:46:17.568
Hey northie, you okay?

01:46:58.746 --> 01:47:00.327
Delta team, engaging enemies.

01:47:00.998 --> 01:47:03.580
Affirmative. Echo team
securing ahab and king.

01:47:09.006 --> 01:47:10.416
Ahab, are you okay?

01:47:11.383 --> 01:47:13.214
I'm okay... this...

01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:16.005
King is alive.

01:47:17.514 --> 01:47:20.756
While the United States was
carrying out a secret operation,

01:47:21.185 --> 01:47:23.801
the enemy state
falsely accused us

01:47:23.896 --> 01:47:28.606
and attempted to damage the balance
of our peaceful world order.

01:47:29.401 --> 01:47:33.940
Our soldiers were thrust into
a life-or-death situation.

01:47:36.659 --> 01:47:41.369
Yes, I just leaked highly
classified military information.

01:47:42.122 --> 01:47:45.580
I'm hoping my presidential status will
keep me from getting indicted,

01:47:46.210 --> 01:47:47.210
for now.

01:47:47.544 --> 01:47:49.330
But I know what comes next,

01:47:49.338 --> 01:47:51.704
I'll be criticized politically
until the end of my term.

01:47:51.715 --> 01:47:54.752
Not even to mention the results
of the upcoming election.

01:47:55.427 --> 01:47:58.965
But for those that would criticize me,
please do so.

01:47:59.264 --> 01:48:02.131
Because my political life is not
what's important right now.

01:48:02.142 --> 01:48:06.226
What is important
is the life of each soldier

01:48:06.230 --> 01:48:10.314
who throws him or herself
into battle for our country.

01:48:12.403 --> 01:48:14.314
And it is my solemn duty

01:48:14.321 --> 01:48:17.438
as the president of
the U.S. to protect them.

01:48:29.545 --> 01:48:31.251
I can confirm again,

01:48:31.547 --> 01:48:33.333
ahab is alive.

01:48:34.508 --> 01:48:38.626
Today, he fought for our country.
And I'll do everything in my power

01:48:38.721 --> 01:48:41.463
to see that he makes it
back home safely.

01:48:43.892 --> 01:48:45.598
God bless ahab,

01:48:46.562 --> 01:48:49.520
and god bless
the United States of America.

01:48:50.607 --> 01:48:51.607
Thank you.

01:49:15.382 --> 01:49:17.338
Get king first and move quickly!

01:49:29.897 --> 01:49:31.387
He lost a lot of blood. Lift!

01:49:33.484 --> 01:49:34.564
One, two, three, yes?

01:49:37.154 --> 01:49:39.110
- Let's get that bandage cut.
- Got it.

01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:42.360
We got to wrap this tight.

01:49:42.367 --> 01:49:45.200
Ahab, its me. King is safe.

01:49:45.496 --> 01:49:49.034
We'll soon be arriving to the 7th fleet
stationed in the east sea.

01:49:49.208 --> 01:49:52.245
A TV crew will be filming
your return live.

01:49:52.336 --> 01:49:54.292
You have a printout
of the interview guidelines.

01:49:54.296 --> 01:49:56.537
You know what
you can and cannot say, right?

01:49:56.590 --> 01:49:58.296
All right, king is stabilizing.

01:49:58.383 --> 01:50:00.169
I can't believe
this is happening.

01:50:00.677 --> 01:50:03.544
When this goes live,
you're gonna be a hero.

01:50:05.224 --> 01:50:06.760
Ahab, are you listening?

01:50:07.768 --> 01:50:09.133
What about the doc?

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:11.681
Forget him. He'll never make it.

01:50:14.942 --> 01:50:16.807
Hey, superhero, take it easy.

01:50:17.986 --> 01:50:19.726
Hey, I thought I told you
to calm down!

01:50:24.243 --> 01:50:27.076
Treat him now! Treat him!

01:50:28.831 --> 01:50:32.289
Everyone, stand down!
Lower your weapons!

01:50:33.043 --> 01:50:35.580
I repeat, lower your weapons!

01:50:38.924 --> 01:50:42.382
Of course you got to save him.
No matter what.

01:50:42.761 --> 01:50:46.549
But when you feel the ground
rushing up at you,

01:50:46.598 --> 01:50:49.260
you have to use whoever there,

01:50:49.476 --> 01:50:53.511
be it ever a blood bag
or whatever... Mac.

01:50:55.899 --> 01:50:57.685
I got to save him.

01:51:02.239 --> 01:51:04.150
Enemy aircraft changing course.

01:51:13.208 --> 01:51:15.494
Squadron super 8.
We are under attack.

01:51:15.752 --> 01:51:16.752
King secured!

01:51:17.087 --> 01:51:20.625
I repeat. We are under attack
by the Chinese airforce.

01:51:21.175 --> 01:51:24.212
Station 1-0,
we are engaging the enemy.

01:51:46.241 --> 01:51:48.402
Open the hatch!
Get a parachute on king!

01:52:51.431 --> 01:52:52.090
Ahab!

01:52:52.099 --> 01:52:55.717
Both sides failed to intercept the missile,
but the trajectory is now off.

01:52:55.727 --> 01:52:58.890
It will fall into the sea and
there won't be any damage done.

01:52:58.981 --> 01:53:01.142
Look below you, 300m.

01:53:01.817 --> 01:53:03.057
Can you see king?

01:53:10.284 --> 01:53:11.284
Grab him!

01:53:11.785 --> 01:53:14.777
Now we need him more than ever.
You have to keep a hold of him...

01:57:02.641 --> 01:57:04.927
Hey! Hey!

01:57:06.019 --> 01:57:07.259
Yo, northie!

01:57:22.410 --> 01:57:23.490
Hey, wake up!

01:57:25.956 --> 01:57:29.164
Northie, wake up...

01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:29.641
Thank you.

01:58:32.188 --> 01:58:33.519
Thank you, northie.

01:58:56.463 --> 01:59:00.172
Come home and meet our baby.

01:59:54.104 --> 01:59:57.596
Take point
