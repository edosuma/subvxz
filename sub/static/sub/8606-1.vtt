SUSAN: And that's the news.

01:08.700 --> 01:13.600
But before we sign off, we'd like
to congratulate our very own Evan Baxter,

01:13.700 --> 01:17.500
who has just been elected
Buffalo's representative to Congress.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.900
And, now, we have a surprise for Evan.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.600
No, you don't.
We do.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.500
Oh, no. I really didn't expect this.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.800
Here's a look back at his run for office.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.600
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

01:28.500 --> 01:29.600

01:29.700 --> 01:31.100

01:31.200 --> 01:32.200
That's right!

(ALL CHEERING)

01:39.500 --> 01:41.500
ALL: Baxter! Baxter! Baxter!

01:48.500 --> 01:49.500
Hi.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.000
ALL: Baxter! Baxter!

01:51.000 --> 01:52.500
That's right!

01:54.700 --> 01:55.700
(CLEARING THROAT)

01:57.000 --> 02:01.200
I feel like that old Indian
in front of all the garbage.

02:02.700 --> 02:07.700
So, for the last time, this is Evan Baxter
for Eyewitness News. Good night.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.000
(HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE RAIN PLAYING)

02:24.300 --> 02:27.500
GPS: Huntsville, Virginia.
Prestige Crest, four miles.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.100
What did we do before GPS?

02:29.200 --> 02:30.200
Nothing.

02:30.300 --> 02:32.500
Guys, Dad's very proud of his new car.

02:32.500 --> 02:37.200
Hey, I am proud of my new car.
Look, I'm a politician now.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.100
I'm in the public eye, and as you know,
when you are in the public eye,

02:40.200 --> 02:41.900
image is everything, isn't it?

02:46.900 --> 02:49.800
EVAN: Here it is! Welcome to the good life.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.200
Hey, guys, why the long faces?
We're off on a new adventure!

02:54.200 --> 02:56.400
It's just we're going to miss our friends.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.300
You'll make new friends, better friends.

02:58.300 --> 02:59.500
Yeah, richer friends.

02:59.600 --> 03:03.400
Do not mouth off to me, sir.
I am the boss of you.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.100
And let me tell you something,
you guys are gonna love this place.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.800
And you know what? I think there's
something for our fishermen up there.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.100
EVAN: Baxter family,
this is what's called a scenic vista.

03:14.200 --> 03:18.000
And I don't think the big man himself
could do a better job. Pretty cool, huh?

03:18.100 --> 03:19.900
Hey, Dad, an iguana can stay underwater
for 28 minutes.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
What's that?

03:21.100 --> 03:22.900
And a shrimp's heart is in its head.
Really?

03:23.000 --> 03:25.200
Okay, someone's had enough Animal Planet
for one lifetime.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.200
Yeah, let's head out! Come on.
The best is yet to come!

03:29.000 --> 03:31.700
EVAN: Gentlemen, I have saved
the best for last.

03:31.800 --> 03:35.300
Look over to the right.
That is your new home.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.600
RYAN: Whoa!

03:42.700 --> 03:43.900
JORDAN: That's our house?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Uh-huh.
JOAN: I don't remember it being
this big in the brochure.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.400
Was it this big in the brochure?

03:47.500 --> 03:48.700
EVAN: Pretty amazing, isn't it?

03:48.800 --> 03:50.400
There they are!

03:51.900 --> 03:54.000
Is this curb appeal or what?

03:54.100 --> 03:55.600
Here we go!

03:55.700 --> 03:57.200
Honey, I think you're blocking my photo.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.300
Sorry.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.400
All right, everybody! Say "escrow"!

RYAN: Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Go. Go. Go.

(CHILDREN EXCLAIMING)

04:11.200 --> 04:12.300
This is our house?

MAN: Careful!

04:15.500 --> 04:17.399
JOAN: Honey, be careful!
EVAN: Watch it!

04:17.500 --> 04:18.600
Are you kidding me?

04:18.700 --> 04:19.899
Mom, can we go upstairs?
JOAN: Yep.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.399
And I get my own room, right?
Yep.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.900
(YELLING EXCITEDLY)

04:22.900 --> 04:25.500
Mr. Baxter, could you give us some
direction on these kitchen cabinets?

04:25.600 --> 04:26.600
Sure.

04:26.600 --> 04:31.200
Okay, it's between your maple
and your old-growth Brazilian cherry.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.200
That is nice! Which is best?

04:33.200 --> 04:36.300
Well, if you're not sensitive
to that "save the rainforest" stuff,

04:36.400 --> 04:37.800
you can't beat the Brazilian cherry.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.100
It's 200, 300 years old.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.700
Three hundred years.
Three hundred.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.300
Wow. That is old.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.600
And now you are going to hold my dishes.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.400
That's right. You going with the cherry?
Cheery cherry!

04:46.500 --> 04:48.000
Yeah. Definitely.
He's going with the cherry!

04:49.200 --> 04:50.300
RYAN: Dad, look!

04:50.400 --> 04:51.700
No, no, no!

04:51.700 --> 04:54.200
Ryan, do not touch him, please!

04:54.300 --> 04:55.800
Oh, no, no, no, no, get him away!

04:55.900 --> 04:58.200
No. He might have lice, fleas,
maggots or something.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.000
You do not play with stray dogs
because they are very...

05:01.100 --> 05:03.400
No, no! Get away, get away! Go!

05:04.100 --> 05:05.600
Okay. Oh, no, no, no.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.100
He's thirsty.
No, no, no.

05:07.200 --> 05:10.100
No, you don't! There we go.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.800
Well, Ryan, he's a stray.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.300
If we give him water,
he's just going to come back.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.900
Come on, Dad, why can't we keep him?
I mean, we've got a new house.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.900
Okay, Ryan, this is why we can't keep him.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.600
They are stinky. They are smelly.
They get hair all over the place.

05:21.700 --> 05:22.900
They get a little thing called the mange.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
In a nutshell, he is disgusting.
Case in point.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.400
(BOTH GIGGLING)

05:30.900 --> 05:34.200
EVAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
this concludes day one

05:34.300 --> 05:35.800
of the Baxters' new and exciting life.

05:35.900 --> 05:38.200
I have to do the new house dance.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.800
Wow! That dance?

05:40.900 --> 05:42.400
Mmm-hmm.
That's a good new house dance.

05:42.500 --> 05:43.800
Thank you.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.000
You know, those boys were having
so much fun tonight,

05:46.100 --> 05:48.100
I thought I would never get them to bed.

05:48.100 --> 05:52.800
And then Ryan did the cutest thing.
He asked if we could all pray together.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.900
Really? What did you pray about?

05:55.900 --> 05:58.000
He met a dog. What do you think
he prayed for?

05:58.100 --> 06:00.000
(EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST)

06:00.000 --> 06:02.800
Just a walking petri dish, that dog.

06:02.900 --> 06:05.100
And Jordan was very precise.

06:05.100 --> 06:08.900
He prayed for good visibility, good weather
on the hiking trip tomorrow.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.300
The hiking trip? Oh, right. Yeah.
The hiking trip. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.300
You wanna know what I prayed for?

06:14.300 --> 06:16.200
Yeah. What did you pray for?

06:16.300 --> 06:19.400
I prayed we would become closer
as a family.

06:20.600 --> 06:25.100
Honey, you don't need to pray for that
to happen. I will make that happen.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.100
(SIGHING)

06:26.600 --> 06:28.300
What would you pray for?

06:28.300 --> 06:30.900
Me? I don't know. Praying just...

06:31.700 --> 06:32.700
(SIGHING)

06:32.800 --> 06:36.600
Honey, you're the one who said
you wanted to change the world.

06:37.100 --> 06:39.000
It's a pretty big job.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.600
If it were me,
I would take all the help I could get.

06:44.700 --> 06:47.100

This is Evan Baxter.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.800
Just wanted to say thank you for everything.

07:28.800 --> 07:32.700
Thank you for the new car and for the house.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.700
The house is great. I love it.

07:36.300 --> 07:41.100
I mean, I picked it out,
but you created matter and everything, so...

07:44.300 --> 07:48.100
I just wanted to say that I think
Joan makes a good point,

07:48.200 --> 07:52.700
and that I am now in a position
of great power,

07:52.800 --> 07:56.600
and I know that with great power
comes great responsibility.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.900
So, God,

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
(CLEARING THROAT)

08:04.800 --> 08:07.200
Please help me change the world.

08:09.100 --> 08:12.000
Okay. That's it. I'm hanging up now.

08:12.900 --> 08:15.400
God bless... Well, you. Okay.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.400
(ALARM RINGING)

08:38.400 --> 08:40.500
What? That's weird.

08:40.600 --> 08:41.600
What?

08:41.700 --> 08:43.299
I set the alarm for 7:00.

I am successful. I am powerful.
I am handsome.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.200
I am happy, successful,
powerful, handsome, happy.

09:23.300 --> 09:28.600
All right, everyone, wish me luck.
The Congressman has left the building.

09:28.700 --> 09:33.500
All right, Baxter brood, I will see you
later on this afternoon for the big hike. Yes?

09:33.600 --> 09:34.800
EVAN: You psyched? Are you ready?

09:34.900 --> 09:35.900
ALL: Yeah.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.200
Bye. See you.
Good luck, honey.

09:37.300 --> 09:38.500
Bye, guys!
See you later.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.900
Oh, gosh.

09:42.900 --> 09:45.700
Wow. Honey, did you order anything?

09:46.200 --> 09:48.200
"Alpha and Omega Hardware"?

09:48.200 --> 09:49.200
JOAN: Never heard of them.

09:49.300 --> 09:50.500
Me either.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.900
What do we have?

09:53.200 --> 09:54.300
(GASPING)

09:54.300 --> 09:55.800
What is this stuff?

09:57.400 --> 09:59.000
Must have the wrong address.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.700
Yup. The wrong address.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.500

Good morning.

Good morning.

Oh, this is so cool.

10:15.700 --> 10:16.700
Uh-huh.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.600
Yeah. This'll work.

10:18.700 --> 10:22.600
There he is! The head honcho.
The big kahuna.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.600
Rita, I think I have to do the dance.

10:24.700 --> 10:25.900
Do the dance.

10:25.900 --> 10:27.300
(GRUNTING)

10:29.500 --> 10:30.800
That's enough of the dance.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.000
Oh, this is nice! This is really nice!

10:33.100 --> 10:35.700
This is too nice.
There's something crooked going on.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.000
Do you smell anthrax?

10:37.100 --> 10:39.000
Congressman!
Hey, Marty!

10:39.100 --> 10:40.500
Nice sound to that.
I like it.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.500
Here they are!

10:41.600 --> 10:42.600
(ALL CHEERING)

10:42.800 --> 10:43.800
All right.

10:43.900 --> 10:45.600
You remember Sarah, Allen, Michael.

10:45.700 --> 10:48.400
I don't think you know the new kid
Eugene Tennanbaum. I found him at G.W.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.600
Sort of a walking search engine. Watch this.
How many stars on the flag in 1818?

10:51.700 --> 10:52.700
15.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.700
And Congressman Baxter's coffee habits?

10:54.700 --> 10:57.800
He likes a morning latte with a cruller,
a decaf espresso after lunch,

10:57.900 --> 10:59.500
served sans pastry of any kind.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.200
Very impressive. A little freaky,
but I like this kid.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.900
(LAUGHING) I love you.

11:04.900 --> 11:05.900
Hmm?

11:06.400 --> 11:09.900
I mean, we should hang out socially.
I just got a ping-pong table.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.500
Not going to happen.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.800
Go find out where his license plates are.
Everybody else, back to your holes.

11:14.900 --> 11:15.900
EUGENE: He was actually right.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.800
I'm doing a background check on that kid.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.600
Ta-da! This, my friend, is a power office,
to remind you of the mission!

11:22.600 --> 11:24.100
BOTH: "Change the world!"

11:24.100 --> 11:25.900
Okay, Evan, who do you know?
What do you mean?

11:25.900 --> 11:27.900
Oh, come on.
Yesterday we're in the basement.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.800
Today, look at this place.
It's like the Emerald City!

11:29.900 --> 11:33.200
"Enjoy your office.
Your neighbor, Congressman Long."

11:33.200 --> 11:35.500
Congressman Long did this?
Did you say "neighbor"?

11:35.600 --> 11:38.400
That's right. He lives in Prestige Crest,
right up the street.

11:38.500 --> 11:42.300
Evan, you got to tell me these things.
Think of the publicity angle on this!

11:42.400 --> 11:44.800
You and Congressman Long
having a barbecue.

11:44.900 --> 11:46.800
Congressman Long eating your hot dog.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.500
RITA: Hate to break up
your little weenie roast.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.300
Congressman Long's assistant
just dropped this off.

11:51.300 --> 11:52.700
The Congressman would like for you

11:52.800 --> 11:55.000
to junior cosponsor this bill
that he's introducing.

11:55.100 --> 11:59.400
Hold on. Congressman Long asked us to
junior cosponsor his bill? What's the bill?

Rita, why didn't you tell me about this?

12:05.500 --> 12:06.600
I just did.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.300
You need to tell me about it
before I need to know about it.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.500
Marty, you are not the vice congressman.
I am the legislative...

12:10.600 --> 12:14.400
Nobody voted for you. If Evan gets shot
in the head, you do not automatically...

12:14.500 --> 12:16.400
If Evan got shot in the head,
you're the first suspect.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.600
All right, Eugene, Congressman Long's bill.
What is it?

12:19.700 --> 12:22.700
HR7124, better known as CINPLAN.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.500
The bill would open up fringe areas
of the national parks for development.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.900
Long's been sitting on it for ages...

12:27.000 --> 12:29.100
Got it. Pause. Come on, Evan, this is huge.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.600
You hitch your wagon to the right star,

12:30.600 --> 12:32.900
you could ride all the way down
to Pennsylvania Avenue.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.300
This is day one.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.600
You got your name on a major piece
of legislation!

12:36.600 --> 12:39.600
Oh, and another thing,
he wants you to read it today.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.300
Well, I can't do it today.

12:41.300 --> 12:42.500
I promised my kids...
Eugene.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.500
Well, sir, there's a time clock on the bill.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.600
If Congressman Long wants to
pass it this quarter,

12:46.700 --> 12:48.800
he's going to have to introduce it
to the committee immediately.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.500
I'm personally going with whatever
Congressman Baxter decides,

12:51.600 --> 12:54.500
because if I could be like one man,
it'd be him.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.900
Either him or Kareem.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.100
Can I tase him?

12:57.100 --> 12:58.200
Gene! Heel!

12:58.300 --> 12:59.700
It'd probably be you.

Yeah, that's not mine. I didn't order that!

14:35.200 --> 14:39.000

You got a complaint, call the number!

you were afraid of Gumby.

Gentlemen, I'm sure you're all wondering
why I've assembled you here today.

38:17.100 --> 38:19.900
An Argentine lake duck has
a penis as long as its body.

38:19.900 --> 38:21.900
Wow, that's huge. He must be proud.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.200
So, I have come up with a little
construction project for us this weekend.

38:26.300 --> 38:27.400
The whole weekend?

38:27.500 --> 38:28.900
The whole weekend. Yes!

38:29.100 --> 38:30.800
And maybe a couple weekends after that.

38:30.900 --> 38:33.100
I can do this. Help!

38:33.100 --> 38:34.300
(GRUNTING)

38:34.400 --> 38:37.300
How do I stand up with a piece of wood?
Here we go.

38:37.700 --> 38:38.800
(JUST LIKE NOAH'S ARK PLAYING)

38:38.800 --> 38:40.500
Oh, man. Okay, that's good.

38:40.600 --> 38:41.600
(GROANING)

38:42.100 --> 38:45.800
Mother! Father! Sister! Brother! Wow!

38:45.900 --> 38:47.500
EVAN: Keep it straight.

38:48.700 --> 38:49.700
(GRUNTING)

38:50.900 --> 38:52.600
Hey, Dad, he's back!

38:52.900 --> 38:54.400
Ryan, no, don't do...

38:54.500 --> 38:55.500
Ow!

38:56.400 --> 38:59.400
Leverage it up! Leverage. Okay.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.000
Just put some leverage.
You got to put some body weight.

39:01.100 --> 39:03.100
Ready? One, two, three. Come on.

39:03.800 --> 39:04.700
(WOOD SNAPPING)

39:04.900 --> 39:05.800
(EXCLAIMING)

39:06.000 --> 39:07.100
(THUDDING)

39:07.200 --> 39:08.800
Oh, I'm an idiot.

39:08.800 --> 39:12.300
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Congressman.
Why do you have raw beef hands?"

39:12.300 --> 39:14.400
"Well, I'm building an ark."

39:15.700 --> 39:16.800
(GROANING)

39:16.900 --> 39:20.200
I got a boo-boo! I got a boo-boo!
I got a boo-boo!

39:26.000 --> 39:30.900
You ever hear of Home Depot?
Here we go! Here we go! Oh, yeah!

39:31.000 --> 39:32.600
(SCATTING)

39:32.900 --> 39:33.900

(GRUNTING)

39:35.600 --> 39:38.100
(GROANING)

39:41.100 --> 39:45.100
All right. So our little Marlboro Man
moment didn't work out so well.

39:45.200 --> 39:48.100
It's a disaster. I don't know
how to build something like this.

39:48.100 --> 39:49.800
That's easy. Just don't.

39:49.800 --> 39:51.600
(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)

39:54.200 --> 39:55.200
Wow.

39:55.300 --> 39:56.300
(PHONE RINGING)

39:56.800 --> 39:58.100
Hello.

39:58.200 --> 40:01.300
Yes, Marty. Your fearless leader is right here.

40:02.500 --> 40:03.600
Hey, Marty, what's up?

40:13.100 --> 40:15.700
Yes, I'll tell him. Thank you.

40:18.900 --> 40:21.300
I might need security. Thank you.

40:23.900 --> 40:25.200
Can I help you?

40:25.500 --> 40:26.600
Rita, it's me.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.600
Why do you sound like Evan Baxter,
but look like a Bee Gee?

40:30.600 --> 40:32.100
Okay. All right.

40:32.600 --> 40:35.500
Okay, that's great. It's longer.

40:35.500 --> 40:38.400
Oh, my God. It is you.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.100
Evan, what happened?

40:41.200 --> 40:42.300
Did you fall in a mine shaft?

40:42.400 --> 40:43.400
No.

40:43.500 --> 40:44.500
Did you just come out of a coma?

40:44.600 --> 40:45.600
No.

40:45.700 --> 40:47.900
Were you attacked by a werewolf?

40:47.900 --> 40:49.200
No, I wasn't.

40:49.300 --> 40:52.200
Well, if you were going for that rugged look,
you overshot it.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.800
You look like a bum in a suit.

40:53.900 --> 40:56.000
You need Super cuts and a shave.

40:56.100 --> 40:57.400
(EXCLAIMING)

40:57.500 --> 40:59.600
Right! Yeah. But I can't. It doesn't work.

40:59.700 --> 41:01.300
What do you mean, it doesn't work?

41:01.400 --> 41:02.700
It doesn't work!

41:02.800 --> 41:04.500
What? Are you shooting up Rogaine?

41:04.500 --> 41:08.000
Rita, if Evan shows up... I'm sorry, sir.
I'll be with you in just one...

41:09.000 --> 41:10.800
Evan?
Take it in. Take it in.

41:10.900 --> 41:12.600
Okay, yeah, to answer any questions
you may have,

41:12.700 --> 41:14.800
I am going through adult puberty!

41:14.900 --> 41:17.300
This is all temporary.
Why did you bring me down here?

41:17.400 --> 41:18.500
What was so important?

41:18.600 --> 41:20.300
What is so important?

41:20.400 --> 41:23.100
I've got a letter of intent here
about Congressman Long's bill.

41:23.100 --> 41:24.200
You remember that, don't you?

41:24.300 --> 41:27.400
Well, you haven't been here and now
he wants you to sign this in person, Evan!

41:27.400 --> 41:29.700
No, I can't do that. Nope, nope, nope.
Not gonna happen.

41:29.800 --> 41:32.600
No. You can't do that.
Not looking like that. You have to go shave!

41:32.700 --> 41:35.000
I can't shave, Marty.
When I shave, it grows back out.

41:35.100 --> 41:38.000
That happens when you shave!
But then you shave again!

41:38.100 --> 41:39.600
You have no idea.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.600
Evan, what is going on?

41:42.700 --> 41:43.900
I'm...

41:48.400 --> 41:50.200
Building something.

41:51.700 --> 41:53.400
MARTY: You're building something?

41:53.500 --> 41:55.200
Well, I hope it's a barber shop.

41:55.300 --> 41:58.200
Guys, I can't let Long see me
this way, okay?

41:58.200 --> 42:01.400
You're gonna have to tell him I'm sick.
Just cover for me. Just help me out!

42:02.400 --> 42:03.400
(DOOR CLOSING)

42:04.600 --> 42:07.600
Come on, Evan, be reasonable.
You got to get rid of that beard.

42:07.700 --> 42:09.600
I need your face back. I need you back.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.300
Can you at least tell me
what you're building?

42:11.400 --> 42:13.500
I'm building a boat.
You're building a boat?

42:13.500 --> 42:16.200
Look, you got to cover for me.
I don't want anybody to see...

42:16.300 --> 42:18.500
Congressman! There you are!

42:18.600 --> 42:20.600
Congressman Long, I, I, I, I...

42:20.600 --> 42:23.600
Stop stammering, son.
We all play hooky from time to time.

42:23.700 --> 42:27.500
I'm not gonna turn you in to the principal.
Mostly because I am the principal.

42:27.500 --> 42:28.900
(LAUGHING)

42:28.900 --> 42:30.000
Very good.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.500
What's with the veil?
Did you get your new set of braces?

42:32.500 --> 42:36.000
No, no. No. That's hilarious, though.

42:36.100 --> 42:38.900
Would you drop that thing, son?
I can't understand a word you're saying.

42:48.200 --> 42:50.100
It's a wife thing, sir.

42:50.200 --> 42:51.900
Just trying to spice up the love life.

42:52.900 --> 42:55.300
She's a big Loggins and Messina fan.

42:55.300 --> 42:57.700
Keeping it fresh. Keeping it real.

42:57.700 --> 43:00.400
Would you excuse us for a moment?

43:00.500 --> 43:02.900
The Congressman and I are going to
have a little chat.

43:06.900 --> 43:08.000
Come on.

43:08.100 --> 43:10.300
Nice, isn't it? Politics is dog-eat-dog,

43:10.400 --> 43:13.000
but if you survive, they give you
a bigger den. Have a seat.

43:13.100 --> 43:17.100
So, tell me, Congressman,
are you freaking out on me or what?

43:17.200 --> 43:18.200
No, sir.

43:18.200 --> 43:21.500
Oh, come on, son. I hand you
your first cosponsor ship of a bill,

43:21.600 --> 43:23.900
and when you finally show up
you look like the fifth Beatle.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.300
Now, you expect me to believe
everything is hunky dory?

43:26.400 --> 43:29.200
Well, sir, actually, things have been
a little more dory.

43:29.300 --> 43:33.400
Of course they are. I get it.
You know anything about animals, son?

43:34.600 --> 43:37.600
The Argentine lake duck has a penis
as long as its body.

43:39.700 --> 43:43.600
Although you probably already know that.
Or have heard it. Not experienced it.

43:43.600 --> 43:45.800
You ever heard of the Arctic white wolf?

43:45.800 --> 43:46.900
No, sir.

43:46.900 --> 43:48.000
Top of the food chain.

43:48.100 --> 43:50.800
It's fast, it's smart, can fend for itself,
but it chooses not to.

43:50.900 --> 43:52.400
It chooses to run with a pack.

43:52.500 --> 43:53.600
And do you know why?

43:53.600 --> 43:54.600
No.

43:54.700 --> 43:57.200
The Arctic white wolf,
Congressman, realizes

43:57.300 --> 43:59.000
that it is stronger as part of a group.

43:59.100 --> 44:02.100
Do you know what happens when one of
these wolves decides to fend for itself?

44:02.100 --> 44:04.900
The pack kills the loner
for the greater good of the community.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.700
Ouch, that hurts.

44:06.700 --> 44:10.000
Are you familiar with Jim Jenkins,
the junior congressman from Tennessee?

44:10.100 --> 44:13.500
When I met Congressman Jenkins,
he was fresh off the turnip truck,

44:13.600 --> 44:15.700
but now he's sitting on his own committee.

44:15.800 --> 44:18.900
Congressman Jenkins, Congressman
Whitehall, Congressman Freeman,

44:19.000 --> 44:22.700
they all have committee chairs
because they all run with the pack.

44:22.800 --> 44:24.900
Now, you have to come to a decision.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.200
Are you gonna run with the pack
or are you gonna lone wolf it?

44:27.300 --> 44:29.400
I am a pack man, sir.

44:29.500 --> 44:33.600
Good. I'm introducing the CINPLAN bill
in 2 weeks. C-SPAN is covering it live.

44:33.700 --> 44:35.800
I want your full support and nothing else.

44:35.900 --> 44:37.000
Yes, sir.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.200
Those fish are on you like bait on a hook.

44:42.200 --> 44:43.800
Birds follow you.

44:44.700 --> 44:46.400
Fish follow you.

44:50.100 --> 44:53.300
Let's see if we can get
some congressmen to follow you.

44:53.300 --> 44:55.400
Let's get this bill passed,
shall we, Congressman?

44:55.500 --> 44:56.600
Yes, sir.

44:58.800 --> 45:00.400
Hey, fleabag, out of the way.

45:00.500 --> 45:02.500
Hey, Dad, I think there are more
animals than yesterday.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.700

our audience waiting, shall we?

but we're gonna need some help.

45:21.600 --> 45:24.800
I know. We just need something
to lift those beams.

There's no sign of our heat wave breaking,

If the ark isn't finished by then, you will be.

Is that when it's going to happen?
September 22, midday?

MAN OVER TV: High temperatures tomorrow
back into the 90s everywhere,

47:59.500 --> 48:00.700
right on through Tuesday

48:00.700 --> 48:04.200
and the next seven days,
no showers, no storms.

48:04.300 --> 48:08.500
That would be a good day to have chicken.
How about Mom's chicken? Huh?

Hon, could we have some more chicken
September 22, midday?

Yeah, we do, it's in the back,
next to the frankincense and myrrh.

It has to come down.

Prestige Crest used to be federal lands,

but what's interesting is
how it got into private hands.

01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.700
Congressman Long got the approval
to build a dam

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.700
and then passed out the surrounding lands
to a group of private investors.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.100
Now, the locals fought this thing for years.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.399
They said Long and his developer buddies
were cutting corners,

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.800
like skipping important
building code checkpoints.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.899
And with the land use bill, he's gonna do
the same thing with the national parks.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.700
So, you stand by and shake your pom-poms
while Long and his buddies get rich.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.899
What can we do? I'm suspended.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.399

that you can and will fight this bill.

I have to get back to the ark.

The ark? All right. Okay.

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:40.200
God told you to build an ark?
Yes.

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:43.300
But did he tell you to make your friends
believe in you and follow you here

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:46.500
so you can make us look stupid?
'Cause I go to church every Sunday.

taking a little profit?

there are people who pay for it, and yes,
those people want this bill to happen

and, by God, it's gonna happen.
Now you look down there.

to save the Earth. Go for it.

for a little precipitation?

Honey, maybe God didn't mean
a literal flood.

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:49.600

or emotion or awareness.

Honey, the clouds are moving away.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:09.600
No, no. No, this isn't right.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.800
Evan, even if it kept raining,
it's not like it could cause a flood in a day.

01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:19.100
But today is the day! It has to be.
This just doesn't make any sense!

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:22.200
Wait a second.

01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:23.300
What is it?

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:27.100
Marty said that Long cut corners,
violated building codes.

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.300
What are you talking about?

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.800
The lake, Long Lake.

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:33.500
It's named after him.
It's the lake! It's the lake!

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:48.200
Oh, no.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.800
Get on the ark! 
Everyone, on the ark now!

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:56.700
I think we should get on the ark.

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:59.600
I agree. I think we should get on the ark also.

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:02.700
I'm cold. I'm wet. I'm going home.

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:12.400
Ladies first! Move!

This is really happening.

All right, boys! Let's go! Let's go!

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:46.000
We're gonna need a bigger boat.
Stay here with the kids.

What do you mean there was water damage?
It rained for ten minutes.

That is not possible.

Hello, Congressman.
Mind if I park my boat here for a little while?

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:16.600
But how...

01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:17.900
The dam, Congressman.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.600
Your reservoir ruptured.
Prestige Crest, it's all gone.

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.600
No. They said that couldn't happen.

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.600
I never thought this...

If that comes out your front,

I don't even want to know
what's coming out the back.

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:46.900
(SNARLING)

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.500
Don't look down, Congressman,
but the wolves are here,

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:53.500
although I wouldn't worry so much
about these wolves as those.

has been suspended,

pending investigation of 
Congressman Long for profiteering...

MAN 2: Of course now, the question is,
how will these animals be returned

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.100
to their natural habitats?

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:33.000
Something tells me, if God got them here,
he can probably get them home.

WOMAN 2: The House will undoubtedly
reinstate Congressman Baxter

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.000

All right. What do you say
we take a little break?

We've only been walking
for, like, five minutes, Dad.

Well, five on, five off.
Life is about balance, right?

01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:00.600
How about some sandwiches?
Okay.

Everyone but Buster
is going to get a sandwich.

You do not get a sandwich! 
You're a dog and you do 
not get a sandwich!

Buster is part of the family now.
You're just gonna have to get used to it.

You knew the dam was unstable.

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:46.500
If it hadn't been for the ark,
my family, the neighbors...

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.800
I fought you every step of the way.

01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:50.400
Yes, but you did it.

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:56.000
So, you had nothing to do with the flood?
Like where the ark landed exactly?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.500
I gave you a little shove at the end. 
Sue me.

So?

How do we change the world?

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:25.700
One act of random kindness at a time.
