01:54.384 --> 01:55.786

01:59.657 --> 02:01.659
<i>You want me to find you.</i>

02:11.869 --> 02:13.671
<i>I see you.</i>

02:21.645 --> 02:22.746
Move it!

02:25.816 --> 02:28.285
[police chatter on radio]

02:30.821 --> 02:32.854
- Are we clear in there?
- Yeah.

02:32.856 --> 02:34.558
All right.

02:47.939 --> 02:50.740
McCaffrey, it's a mess in there.
Try not to make it worse.

02:50.742 --> 02:52.109
Yeah.

03:09.594 --> 03:11.563
Hey, anyone moved her?

03:12.831 --> 03:15.197
Nope.
There's a burned filter

03:15.199 --> 03:17.834
- still in her left hand.
- [grunts]

03:17.836 --> 03:20.538
Boyfriend said he left
her in the bed smokin'.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.742
[sniffs]

03:24.676 --> 03:26.743
Guy with a red hoodie?

03:26.745 --> 03:28.611
Yeah.

03:28.613 --> 03:31.648
Said when he came back,
the place was already burnin'.

03:31.650 --> 03:33.850
Yeah.

03:33.852 --> 03:35.920
Uh, he tried to get to her.

03:36.788 --> 03:38.723
Not a chance.

03:44.229 --> 03:45.730
Tequila.

03:49.835 --> 03:51.670
[sniffs]

03:53.471 --> 03:54.772
Well, he's right.

03:54.774 --> 03:57.007
The fire started
in the mattress.

03:57.009 --> 03:59.943
Accidental by
smokin' materials.

03:59.945 --> 04:01.712
I didn't say that.

04:01.714 --> 04:06.519
[sirens wailing]

04:12.825 --> 04:15.793
[firefighter] Give him a hand
with those ladders!

04:15.795 --> 04:18.464
[inaudible]

04:41.554 --> 04:43.854
Right now?

04:43.856 --> 04:46.559
- Right before the fire?
- Yeah.

04:48.527 --> 04:49.961
I tried,
but it burnt my hands.

04:49.963 --> 04:52.931
- Thanks, man. I got this.
- Okay.

04:52.933 --> 04:55.499
Hey. How you doin'?

04:55.501 --> 04:57.702
I, um...
I'm sorry about your loss.

04:57.704 --> 04:58.870
Thanks.

04:58.872 --> 05:00.939
What's your name, man?

05:00.941 --> 05:02.974
I... Dylan.

05:02.976 --> 05:04.909
Sorry, I...

05:04.911 --> 05:06.945
still can't believe it.

05:06.947 --> 05:09.614
It's okay.
I understand.

05:09.616 --> 05:13.585
All right. Dylan,
was your girlfriend in bed alone?

05:13.587 --> 05:15.520
Yeah. Um...

05:15.522 --> 05:18.458
I was watching a movie
on the couch.

05:19.626 --> 05:20.959
Must've fallen asleep.

05:20.961 --> 05:23.862
And by the time I woke up...

05:23.864 --> 05:26.664
Yeah. I-I-I get it. I get it.

05:26.666 --> 05:30.335
But, you see, the thing about people
burning to death is that they...

05:30.337 --> 05:32.003
they always,
even in their sleep,

05:32.005 --> 05:34.839
reflexively pull away
from the flame.

05:34.841 --> 05:36.975
But your girlfriend
didn't.

05:36.977 --> 05:40.545
And also, you know, people don't sleep
in the middle of a king-size bed, right?

05:40.547 --> 05:42.747
They pick one side
or the other.

05:42.749 --> 05:46.051
When somebody lowers an
unconscious person onto a bed,

05:46.053 --> 05:48.686
they put 'em in the middle,
'cause it's easier.

05:48.688 --> 05:51.924
So, you got to understand a curious
person like me is left wondering,

05:51.926 --> 05:53.893
when I get this tested,

05:53.895 --> 05:55.997
am I gonna find more
than agave in there?

05:57.899 --> 06:00.900
- [grunts]
- Fucking piece of shit!

06:00.902 --> 06:02.768
Jesus, who are you?

06:02.770 --> 06:04.005
- I'm a fireman.
- [handcuffs cranking]

06:48.649 --> 06:50.685
[engine starting]

06:52.587 --> 06:53.654
[horn honks]

06:54.957 --> 06:58.861
[siren wailing]

07:02.865 --> 07:05.566
- Office of Fire Investigation, can I help you?
- Mornin'.

07:07.069 --> 07:09.202
- You get any sleep?
- Yeah, sure,

07:09.204 --> 07:12.739
if puttin' my head on the steering
wheel outside for 20 minutes counts.

07:12.741 --> 07:15.675
Hey, Sean? Captain
wants to see you.

07:15.677 --> 07:17.811
- What's his name again, Warren?
- Webber.

07:17.813 --> 07:20.080
Christ, he's been here a month.
It's Watts.

07:20.082 --> 07:21.884
You two are hopeless.

07:24.620 --> 07:25.919
Hey, Captain.

07:25.921 --> 07:27.754
You want to see me?

07:27.756 --> 07:29.124
Sit down, please.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.127
[sighs]

07:34.129 --> 07:36.798
Nice work with
the murdered girlfriend.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.135
You got an attaboy from that
watch lieutenant in Homicide.

07:41.137 --> 07:44.004
Doyle?
Did he choke on it?

07:44.006 --> 07:47.141
I got the impression "thank you"
and "Fire Department"

07:47.143 --> 07:49.643
in the same sentence
doesn't come naturally.

07:49.645 --> 07:52.614
Yeah, but we're not really the
Fire Department though, are we?

07:54.083 --> 07:59.120
Temporary detail order
for Maggie Rening to OFI.

07:59.122 --> 08:01.756
Finished state arson school,
peace officer certs

08:01.758 --> 08:04.859
and weapon qualifying.

08:04.861 --> 08:07.028
Why are you
tellin' me this?

08:07.030 --> 08:09.697
She's your new partner.

08:09.699 --> 08:11.165
What? Hang on.

08:11.167 --> 08:13.868
Two-man teams.
That's the rules.

08:13.870 --> 08:17.171
Look, w-w-we've never had
partners before. Why now?

08:17.173 --> 08:21.008
Probably because for too long nobody's
bothered to actually run this unit.

08:21.010 --> 08:24.145
Look, the only reason

08:24.147 --> 08:27.048
suppression captains like you
request OFI is

08:27.050 --> 08:29.884
to brush up your resume before
going for Battalion Chief.

08:29.886 --> 08:31.252
And I get it. I do.

08:31.254 --> 08:33.888
But none of you really
understand how we work here,

08:33.890 --> 08:35.990
and if you're like
every other short-termer,

08:35.991 --> 08:40.061
the whole fireman-with-handcuffs thing
probably rubs you wrong on principle.

08:40.063 --> 08:42.164
We offer a pretty good deal.

08:42.166 --> 08:44.932
I mean, you get to sit there all
day studying for your BC exam,

08:44.934 --> 08:46.834
but in return,

08:46.836 --> 08:49.739
let us catch arsonists
our way, okay?

08:50.940 --> 08:53.676
Yeah, I came from Suppression.

08:54.777 --> 08:57.081
You wanna know one of the fires
I worked there?

08:58.048 --> 08:59.682
West Haddon Street.

09:00.851 --> 09:03.185
I know what you did
in that church.

09:03.187 --> 09:06.788
And maybe with your uncle as Assistant Chief
of this unit nobody has the guts to say it,

09:06.790 --> 09:08.724
but I will.

09:08.726 --> 09:11.994
I don't have a problem
with firemen with handcuffs.

09:11.996 --> 09:15.099
I have a problem with firemen
who are a menace.

09:18.302 --> 09:20.202
Hey, for the record,

09:20.204 --> 09:22.237
I've never asked a thing
of my uncle.

09:22.239 --> 09:24.174
You can go back to work now.

09:27.945 --> 09:29.845
Hey, Maggie Rening.

09:29.847 --> 09:31.048
Yeah.

09:33.250 --> 09:36.854
So let me guess.
Four years on an engine?

09:37.888 --> 09:39.855
Five.

09:39.857 --> 09:42.193
Do you actually know anything
about this work?

09:45.596 --> 09:47.198
Arson bad, right?

09:56.341 --> 09:58.607
- [boy] Hey, wait up!
- Stop!

09:58.609 --> 10:01.878
Come on. We gotta hit
the Hunters before dark.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.314
Hurry up, lazybones!

10:08.019 --> 10:10.989
[boy 2] I'll trade you one
candy bar for that jawbreaker.

10:12.290 --> 10:14.357
Come on.
Your turn to knock.

10:14.359 --> 10:18.930
Hey, ask her for extra.
Hey, ask her for extra.

10:23.868 --> 10:25.802
[boy]
Miss Hunter? We're here.

10:25.804 --> 10:28.171
[boy 2]
Eric, knock louder.

10:28.173 --> 10:30.173
- Eric, knock again.
- Is anyone home?

10:30.175 --> 10:32.308
- Louder!
- Try the door!

10:32.310 --> 10:34.279
I hope Mrs. Hunter
made cookies.

10:36.181 --> 10:37.246
Walk into their house.

10:37.248 --> 10:39.918
[all] Trick or treat!

10:42.887 --> 10:45.123
Mrs. Hunter?

10:53.432 --> 10:57.434
[car alarms wailing]

10:57.436 --> 11:01.071
- [man shouting, indistinct]
- [bell jingles]

11:01.073 --> 11:03.075
- There you go, sir.
- [Sean] Thanks.

11:07.279 --> 11:09.849
[man] Extra lamb spleen,
right?

11:11.083 --> 11:14.351
[chuckles] Can't believe
you're still wearin' that coat.

11:14.353 --> 11:16.822
He was my father.

11:17.923 --> 11:19.859
And he was my brother.

11:21.961 --> 11:23.329
You stalkin' me?

11:25.264 --> 11:28.198
Doesn't take Sherlock
Holmes to find you.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.368
All you gotta do is follow the
stench of the Sean lunch special.

11:31.370 --> 11:34.073
- This conversation have a point?
- Yeah.

11:35.207 --> 11:36.376
Yeah.

11:37.410 --> 11:40.210
[sighs]

11:40.212 --> 11:44.984
You can't keep breakin' balls for every
single captain who does a spin down at Arson.

11:46.118 --> 11:48.954
And is this my uncle
or AC talkin'?

11:49.889 --> 11:51.922
Take your pick.

11:51.924 --> 11:56.127
[scoffs] Eh, well, I'm a big boy.
I can handle him.

11:56.129 --> 11:58.898
Who's increasingly isolating
himself down there.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.068
[sirens chirping]

12:04.371 --> 12:05.906
Well...

12:06.940 --> 12:08.909
I didn't join
for the bowling league.

12:09.376 --> 12:11.111
See ya around.

12:14.014 --> 12:15.248
[door bell jingles]

12:17.050 --> 12:19.186
We got a hit.

12:25.959 --> 12:29.229
[siren wailing]

12:48.014 --> 12:49.215
Okay.

12:49.217 --> 12:50.982
Don't talk.
Just listen to me,

12:50.984 --> 12:53.452
the building, the fire,
everything, okay?

12:53.454 --> 12:55.122
Yes?

12:58.326 --> 13:01.427
Yo. Five so far.

13:01.429 --> 13:04.563
All kids outside
trick or treatin'.

13:04.565 --> 13:07.068
One, we think,
tried the door handle, and, uh...

13:08.569 --> 13:10.202
- Christ.
- Yeah.

13:10.204 --> 13:12.204
[man] Let's go.
We're packin' up here.

13:12.206 --> 13:14.342
- Yo, we clear in there?
- Yeah, we're clear.

13:17.478 --> 13:20.379
[firefighter] Break those couplings.
Roll the wet stuff.

13:20.381 --> 13:23.217
[helicopter approaching]

13:25.253 --> 13:27.286
No sign of
an incendiary device,

13:27.288 --> 13:29.522
yet the door blew
when they opened it.

13:29.524 --> 13:32.258
So, a backdraft.

13:32.260 --> 13:35.562
Hey. If you can't just listen to the
building before you're even in it,

13:35.564 --> 13:37.397
you may as well
do us both a favor

13:37.399 --> 13:39.566
and go wait in the truck.
All right?

13:39.568 --> 13:43.505
[firefighter] Six, get your ladders picked
up and give 17 a hand with any hoses.

14:06.328 --> 14:09.097
Okay, Rening.
So, what are you thinkin'?

14:10.365 --> 14:12.234
Electrical short
in the plug.

14:13.268 --> 14:15.268
Well, the fire certainly
visited the plug,

14:15.270 --> 14:17.404
but there's no way
it started there.

14:17.406 --> 14:20.440
Intense heat crazing,
V-shaped smoke stain.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.342
It checks a lot of boxes.

14:22.344 --> 14:25.145
[sighs] Well, checklists only
cover the physics of the fire.

14:25.147 --> 14:27.514
You also have to understand
what it wants.

14:27.516 --> 14:29.883
Nothin' around that plug
that would excite a fire,

14:29.885 --> 14:32.220
and this fire was excited.

14:33.489 --> 14:36.156
Look at the glass.

14:36.158 --> 14:38.091
If the fire did actually
start in the plug,

14:38.093 --> 14:39.427
it would've lingered there
for a while,

14:39.429 --> 14:42.430
got the lay of the land,
looked for more fuel.

14:42.432 --> 14:46.132
That would've melted
the glass evenly,

14:46.134 --> 14:48.402
not lopsided like that.

14:48.404 --> 14:53.139
That requires extreme heat
comin' from one direction.

14:53.141 --> 14:54.608
You know what?
You're right.

14:54.610 --> 14:57.244
The fire did visit the plug,

14:57.246 --> 15:00.514
but it's either a side effect
of the real deal,

15:00.516 --> 15:04.318
or someone pre-rigged it to
make us think it started there.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.154
The lower half of the room
where our plug is

15:07.156 --> 15:09.523
isn't as burned
as the upper walls.

15:09.525 --> 15:13.227
Means the fire spent
more time high than low,

15:13.229 --> 15:16.065
so it must have
entered high somehow.

15:18.267 --> 15:19.467
Wait a second.

15:19.469 --> 15:21.371
The fire didn't start
in the room.

15:23.673 --> 15:26.442
It came in through the ducts
from somewhere else.

15:35.385 --> 15:37.218
Pooling.

15:37.220 --> 15:40.624
Hot enough to scar metal,
but leave no molten trace.

15:47.464 --> 15:49.299
Watch your step.

15:53.303 --> 15:55.704
That's the furnace.

15:55.706 --> 15:58.375
The ignition point's
at the bottom of that mess.

16:00.177 --> 16:01.378
[sighs]

16:02.979 --> 16:05.747
- Get digging.
- Thanks.

16:05.749 --> 16:07.682
Well, enjoy.

16:07.684 --> 16:09.251
And you?

16:09.253 --> 16:11.388
Me? I'm gonna get dessert.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.191
[cars honking]

16:16.193 --> 16:18.228
Watch your backs.

16:20.264 --> 16:23.298
So, I got four unsolved kids
on my desk, or what?

16:23.300 --> 16:26.268
If you could count, that's five.
And I don't know yet.

16:26.270 --> 16:28.539
Mm. They burn,
they're yours.

16:38.449 --> 16:40.415
A lot of dead kids.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.417
Yeah, too many.

16:42.419 --> 16:44.554
Anybody found
the owners yet?

16:44.556 --> 16:46.422
Looks like
nobody was home.

16:46.424 --> 16:48.693
Touhy's runnin' down
title records.

16:50.528 --> 16:53.296
Listen, we can't let this become a shit
show with the press. You understand?

16:53.298 --> 16:57.032
So, what I need from you ASAP is
cause, all right?

16:57.034 --> 16:59.304
Was it homicide,
was it arson?

17:02.540 --> 17:04.039
Yeah.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.443
Hey.

17:07.278 --> 17:09.180
Are we
on the same page?

17:10.315 --> 17:11.316
[sighs]

17:12.349 --> 17:14.750
It started in
the air conditioning.

17:14.752 --> 17:17.288
Then used the ducts
to get through the house.

17:18.289 --> 17:20.724
- [scoffs]
- I need a little light.

17:23.761 --> 17:26.196
Breaker didn't trip.

17:28.333 --> 17:31.835
The plastic sheathing on
the calibration screw's missing.

17:31.837 --> 17:35.608
Set wrong, it could cause a power
surge and overload the mechanism.

17:37.576 --> 17:41.477
Discoloration shows that this cable here
experienced the highest temperatures.

17:41.479 --> 17:45.616
Now, if the heat source came from within
the cable, as an electrical overload,

17:45.618 --> 17:48.418
it would melt the plastic
insulation against it.

17:48.420 --> 17:53.390
But if not, then the heat source
came from outside the cable,

17:53.392 --> 17:55.561
as in a splash of gasoline.

18:00.699 --> 18:01.765
[buzzing]

18:01.767 --> 18:03.867
Somebody splashed it.

18:03.869 --> 18:07.771
Looks like somebody splashed it to make
it look like an accidental overload,

18:07.773 --> 18:10.507
if nobody bought the shorted
plug in the other room

18:10.509 --> 18:12.545
as an ignition point.

18:15.714 --> 18:18.651
Chief McCaffrey,
is he your uncle?

18:19.818 --> 18:21.685
Yeah, technically.

18:21.687 --> 18:23.821
What do we got?

18:23.823 --> 18:26.657
Or not?

18:26.659 --> 18:30.427
Medical examiner's only done soot-or-shot
prelims on the bodies so far.

18:30.429 --> 18:33.330
We got five males
all under 15.

18:33.332 --> 18:34.498
Hmm.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.333
What killed them?

18:36.335 --> 18:40.437
In the prelim opinion of the ME
the fire killed 'em.

18:40.439 --> 18:42.807
All right,
that's five deaths on us.

18:42.809 --> 18:45.677
Or, uh, you to be exact.

18:45.679 --> 18:48.848
Well, if it's fire,
I think I'm done here?

18:51.585 --> 18:55.320
- What do you think, Sean? Murder?
- It's too early.

18:55.322 --> 18:57.889
But I got to tell you, I'm going to have
a hard time callin' "accidental" on this.

18:57.891 --> 18:59.791
What I don't
got to tell ya is

18:59.793 --> 19:01.759
that there ain't a single
Naugahyde jockey down at City Hall

19:01.761 --> 19:04.161
that wants to call this arson.

19:04.163 --> 19:06.798
Not the mayor, who's already got a serious
problem with his homicide rate this year,

19:06.800 --> 19:10.435
not the PD
and sure as hell not us.

19:10.437 --> 19:13.738
- ATF comin' in on this?
- [chuckles] No.

19:13.740 --> 19:17.175
I think it's safe to say that Sean
buggered that relationship for all time.

19:17.177 --> 19:19.477
Who, Kunz?
The guy's an asshole.

19:19.479 --> 19:22.447
He couldn't pour piss out of a turn-out
boot with the instructions on the heel.

19:22.449 --> 19:23.715
What about the family?

19:23.717 --> 19:27.452
The Hunters, Rod and Jan,
married, no kids.

19:27.454 --> 19:28.821
We can't find them yet.

19:28.823 --> 19:31.356
I'll tell ya what
we're not gonna do.

19:31.358 --> 19:34.695
Until we find the Hunters and we have a
solid determination on cause and origin...

19:35.495 --> 19:36.962
we're not gonna say shit.

19:36.964 --> 19:39.634
Nobody utters the "A" word,
got it?

19:40.467 --> 19:42.801
Now, tell me one true thing.

19:42.803 --> 19:44.903
Canvass gave us a lot
of half-sentences.

19:44.905 --> 19:47.773
There's maybe a gang
hitting houses in the area.

19:47.775 --> 19:50.476
The DOT camera
at the intersection

19:50.478 --> 19:52.411
might give us
video surveillance of a car.

19:52.413 --> 19:54.713
You ID the car, you move.

19:54.715 --> 19:58.617
I want these jag-offs
off the street instantly.

19:58.619 --> 20:00.452
Right? Mm.

20:00.454 --> 20:02.220
Sure.

20:02.222 --> 20:03.758
By the way...

20:04.859 --> 20:05.793
who are you?

20:06.627 --> 20:07.895
Maggie Rening.

20:09.930 --> 20:13.401
- Rening?
- She's detailed to Sean.

20:14.502 --> 20:15.868
Rening.

20:15.870 --> 20:19.471
Well, that's...
That's a beautiful thing.

20:19.473 --> 20:23.842
Now the OFI is officially
the Island of Broken Toys.

20:23.844 --> 20:27.680
Freaks who did this with a ribbon on
top, before we say a word.

20:27.682 --> 20:28.783
Yep.

20:43.431 --> 20:45.598
Whoa, whoa.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.033
[barking]

20:47.035 --> 20:49.903
Hey, I get growled at
enough at work. All right?

20:49.905 --> 20:51.673
[whimpering]

21:14.696 --> 21:16.696
<i>In North Side's Lincoln Park,</i>

21:16.698 --> 21:19.299
<i>in the wake of tonight's
devastating explosion</i>

21:19.301 --> 21:22.535

<i>as they simply went asking

21:29.846 --> 21:32.947

21:32.949 --> 21:35.615
<i>Fire officials are still

[echoing] <i>Sean!</i>

22:58.969 --> 23:01.937
I just don't buy you were drawn
all the way down that ducting.

23:01.939 --> 23:03.674
Not on your own.

23:04.141 --> 23:06.643
You don't hunt that way.

23:18.088 --> 23:19.590
Oh, shit.

23:20.691 --> 23:22.593
They made you lie.

23:23.827 --> 23:24.995
All right.

23:41.445 --> 23:43.114
[low growl]

23:44.648 --> 23:47.986
What? What, are you movin' in?
How'd you get...

23:49.721 --> 23:51.187
Burnin' things
don't bother you, huh?

23:51.189 --> 23:52.889
[growling]

23:52.891 --> 23:56.058
Hey! No more of that,
all right?

23:56.060 --> 23:58.094
- No more of that.
- [whimpers]

23:58.096 --> 24:00.932
Yeah, that's better.
There you go.

24:02.033 --> 24:03.833
Okay, this isn't
what it looks like.

24:03.835 --> 24:06.971
I'm just randomly throwin'
food out there, all right?

24:09.173 --> 24:11.941
Rening. Rening.

24:11.943 --> 24:14.010
You know, I did my homework.

24:14.012 --> 24:16.246
There was a firefighter
named Rening, right,

24:16.248 --> 24:20.650
who got two commendations in a single
year for makin' live snatches in fires.

24:20.652 --> 24:23.486
I mean, wow, that's gotta be
some kind of record, right?

24:23.488 --> 24:25.088
It isn't.

24:25.090 --> 24:28.258
People don't join the fire
department to carry a gun.

24:28.260 --> 24:32.695
They move to OFI either because they're so
busted up they can't do line work anymore,

24:32.697 --> 24:35.831
or they can't get arson out of their
bones, and you clearly aren't either.

24:35.833 --> 24:37.167
Yeah?
Well, which are you?

24:37.169 --> 24:40.770
Me? I rise above
all categories.

24:40.772 --> 24:42.740
Maybe you're both.

24:44.176 --> 24:45.911
Why are you here,
Rening?

24:54.219 --> 24:56.119
[sighs]

24:56.121 --> 24:58.057
[door opens]

24:59.792 --> 25:01.226
They didn't do it.

25:02.695 --> 25:04.795
Lieutenant Doyle ID'd
their plate near the scene

25:04.797 --> 25:05.963
off the intersection camera.

25:05.965 --> 25:08.265
They had gas
and pry bars in the car.

25:08.267 --> 25:10.934
Look, I don't doubt these yo-yos
were up to something, somewhere,

25:10.936 --> 25:13.203
but it wasn't that building.

25:13.205 --> 25:15.072
Oh, what makes you
so sure?

25:15.074 --> 25:18.075
Because these goofballs
had gasoline in the car.

25:18.077 --> 25:20.010
Gasoline's amateur hour.

25:20.012 --> 25:23.013
It burns twice as hot,
bashes around like a bull in a china shop,

25:23.015 --> 25:25.549
and puts itself out
in half the time.

25:25.551 --> 25:28.086
Look, gas chromatograph
came back on the wiring

25:28.088 --> 25:31.222
and there's benzyl-nitrate
all over it, not gasoline,

25:31.224 --> 25:35.226
with just enough sprinkles
of linoleum to, uh, hide the BZ,

25:35.228 --> 25:37.161
but not enough
to confirm a splash.

25:37.163 --> 25:39.230
Now, BZ is
what the pros use, okay?

25:39.232 --> 25:42.300
It burns cool, takes longer to
bite, but when it does,

25:42.302 --> 25:45.103
it holds on like a Gila monster.

25:45.105 --> 25:49.974
Whoever did this is smart enough
to try and fake a fried plug,

25:49.976 --> 25:51.943
is also smart enough

25:51.945 --> 25:55.113
to throw us a basement breaker
panel overload if we got past that,

25:55.115 --> 25:59.050
and smarter still to trick the fire
using the BZ up into the ducting

25:59.052 --> 26:03.154
while hiding it with
linoleum hydrocarbon signatures.

26:03.156 --> 26:06.124
Whoever did this is smarter than
anyone I've come up against.

26:06.126 --> 26:07.992
Not the smartest.

26:07.994 --> 26:10.764
He's been locked up
behind bars for decades.

26:12.065 --> 26:14.000
Ronald Bartel.

26:15.268 --> 26:17.904
Takes it
to a whole 'nother level.

26:18.872 --> 26:21.139
- Ronald Bartel.
- Don't worry about it.

26:21.141 --> 26:24.609
Hey, Doyle.
The Hunters are still missing.

26:24.611 --> 26:26.278
I feel your pain.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.980
Okay, well I need you to put
more manpower into finding them.

26:28.982 --> 26:31.250
Why would I go anywhere near it?
They burn, they're yours.

26:31.252 --> 26:33.085
One of the kids
didn't die by fire.

26:33.087 --> 26:36.055
What? I thought you were
selling a backdraft for them.

26:36.057 --> 26:38.290
The door killed him.
That's blunt force trauma.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.893
[laughs] No, you wouldn't.
Not even you.

26:40.895 --> 26:44.932
What, you wanna see how many of those
little souls I can dump in your lap? Hmm?

26:46.033 --> 26:49.236
- Okay. I'll put a team on it.
- Attaboy.

26:52.139 --> 26:55.274
Ah, Jesus Christ.
What are you doin' here, Kunz?

26:55.276 --> 26:57.209
I thought you'd be workin'
igloo fires in Alaska

26:57.211 --> 26:59.411
after the last
fucked-up call you made.

26:59.413 --> 27:01.814
ATF, OFI Insurance Task Force.

27:01.816 --> 27:04.983
- What, and they put you on it?
- Well, who they didn't was you.

27:04.985 --> 27:06.852
- Who's this?
- Maggie Rening.

27:06.854 --> 27:08.921
Hi. So what are you doin'
stickin' your beak into my fire?

27:08.923 --> 27:11.657
High-profile burn. It makes sense
the city might want a second opinion.

27:11.659 --> 27:14.059
Oh, and the ATF just happens
to have enough budget

27:14.061 --> 27:17.896
to randomly throw extra man
hours at somebody else's fire?

27:17.898 --> 27:21.234
Two guys walk into a building.
One walks out.

27:21.236 --> 27:24.670
You know something, Kunz?
You always trusted your CIs too much.

27:24.672 --> 27:26.905
You know what,
I still clear cases.

27:26.907 --> 27:28.874
And I do it
without jerking off to fire.

27:28.876 --> 27:31.211
Yeah, yeah.
Stay away from my burn.

27:31.213 --> 27:34.082
You always make
this many friends in a day?

27:44.192 --> 27:46.359
Hey, I was just
headin' out to dinner.

27:46.361 --> 27:48.330
Thought you might
wanna come.

27:49.164 --> 27:50.999
Ah, I got plans.

27:52.334 --> 27:54.202
It's your mother's
birthday.

27:55.370 --> 27:57.239
Well, send my best.

28:00.308 --> 28:02.375
You'll be missed.

28:02.377 --> 28:04.377
Again.

28:04.379 --> 28:07.046
Yeah. Well,
talk to her husband about that.

28:07.048 --> 28:08.383
Mm.

28:10.919 --> 28:13.253
[sighs]

28:13.255 --> 28:16.392
[Brian] You know, Sean,
I think about those days...

28:19.995 --> 28:21.663
about your dad...

28:24.032 --> 28:25.366
all the time.

28:25.368 --> 28:27.501
Ahh. Yeah.

28:27.503 --> 28:30.504
Well, thanks for tryin'
to take the shot.

28:30.506 --> 28:32.375
I'll call Mom.

28:33.342 --> 28:35.111
But you still
won't come.

28:35.911 --> 28:37.446
Like I said, I got plans.

28:53.029 --> 28:55.464
[Asian harp music]

28:56.432 --> 28:58.234
You scare him, you know.

29:00.203 --> 29:02.138
I'm sorry, what?

29:03.139 --> 29:05.041
That old man.

29:05.975 --> 29:07.975
Oh, no.
We're friends.

29:07.977 --> 29:11.546
I come here all the time.
Uh, he owns the place.

29:11.548 --> 29:15.182
I've, uh,
seen you here before.

29:15.184 --> 29:16.919
He's freaked out by you.

29:17.421 --> 29:19.387
Uh, no.

29:19.389 --> 29:22.189
I helped him out
a while back.

29:22.191 --> 29:23.960
We're buddies.

29:24.794 --> 29:27.127
Helped him, huh?

29:27.129 --> 29:28.931
Please, tell me.

29:30.234 --> 29:31.968
How?

29:33.537 --> 29:38.073
Uh, well, he kept
havin' kitchen fires.

29:38.075 --> 29:40.808
Um, so I staked it out

29:40.810 --> 29:43.478
and found out it was a
competing diner down the street

29:43.480 --> 29:46.016
pouring grease
down the roof exhaust so...

29:46.550 --> 29:49.084
Caught the bad guys.
That's it.

29:49.086 --> 29:52.254
- And the owner was grateful.
- Yeah, sure.

29:52.256 --> 29:56.224
- So he told you to come by.
- Yeah. I can think here.

29:56.226 --> 29:59.227
So you do, come by any time?

29:59.229 --> 30:01.363
Whoa, sorr... I'm sorry.
Who... Who are you?

30:01.365 --> 30:03.098
Jenny.

30:03.100 --> 30:04.132
Are you a cop?

30:04.134 --> 30:06.167
Uh, fireman.

30:06.169 --> 30:10.272
Well, sort of.
Arson investigator. You?

30:10.274 --> 30:12.007
Geologist.

30:12.009 --> 30:15.010
[chuckles] Come on, really?

30:15.012 --> 30:18.113
Okay. All right.
Wow. Geologist.

30:18.115 --> 30:21.051
So, uh, how do you know
old Tommy over there?

30:22.453 --> 30:24.288
'Cause he's my father.

30:25.323 --> 30:27.356
Oh, shit. Uh...

30:27.358 --> 30:29.024
We don't talk anymore.

30:29.026 --> 30:31.396
Oh, you just hang out here?

30:32.363 --> 30:34.497
Pop quiz.
Who are you?

30:34.499 --> 30:36.232
- Oh. Really?
- Really.

30:36.234 --> 30:37.866
Oh, wow. Okay.

30:37.868 --> 30:41.170
Um, well, uh,

30:41.172 --> 30:44.140
I'm the son and grandson
of dead firemen.

30:44.142 --> 30:46.575
I investigate arson,

30:46.577 --> 30:51.247
not because I like fire,
but because I understand it.

30:51.249 --> 30:54.419
A distinction without a difference
to some of the people I work with.

30:55.286 --> 30:56.652
What about you?

30:56.654 --> 31:01.223
Uh, I am the only daughter
of a traditional father

31:01.225 --> 31:05.061
who has disowned me
because I'm 30, unmarried,

31:05.063 --> 31:08.297
and work looking for oil in the
employ of foreign billionaires,

31:08.299 --> 31:11.635
which basically, in his eyes,
makes me an escort.

31:11.637 --> 31:14.504
I burned my stepfather's
house down when I was a kid.

31:14.506 --> 31:17.543
- 'Cause you understand fire, not like it, right?
- Ooh. Touché.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.478
Uh, my father thinks

31:21.480 --> 31:25.181
I'm the re-incarnated son
that he lost in a miscarriage.

31:25.183 --> 31:29.355
Last time I saw my father alive we were
makin' breakfast for my mom in the kitchen.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.491
I can't remember
the last time I saw my mother.

31:34.326 --> 31:38.062
Everyone I know is either
scared of or for me.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.431
- I'm very good at what I do.
- I'm better.

31:41.433 --> 31:43.102
[scoffs]

31:44.336 --> 31:47.204
[chuckles]
All right.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.607
Ooh, shit.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.411
Uh, did that just blow it?

31:54.113 --> 31:55.481
Let's see.

32:01.687 --> 32:04.488
Oh, that cop Doyle
hasn't found the Hunters yet,

32:04.490 --> 32:06.656
but he sent over
what the PD has on them.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.258
Anything interesting?

32:08.260 --> 32:09.493
[sucks in air]

32:09.495 --> 32:11.696
Couple's been through
a few bankruptcies,

32:11.698 --> 32:14.431
DA opened up a case against the
husband for money laundering,

32:14.433 --> 32:15.535
but dropped it.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.169
Find out how much insurance
they carry.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.171
[alarm signaling]

32:21.173 --> 32:22.740
[man over PA]
<i>Battalion Three, Engine Seven.</i>

32:22.742 --> 32:24.709
<i>This a two story commercial
fire showing.</i>

32:24.711 --> 32:26.477
Uh, not much.

32:26.479 --> 32:28.446
If anything,
the place was underinsured.

32:28.448 --> 32:31.349
With it being tied up
in their latest bankruptcy...

32:31.351 --> 32:34.421
- <i>I'm seeing blue smoke at the roofline.</i>
- Son of a bitch.

32:37.290 --> 32:41.559
Battalion Three,
this is OFI 4-2-2 en route. Stay put.

32:41.561 --> 32:43.428
Aren't Touhy and Rickets up?

32:43.430 --> 32:46.397
I know this asshole.
He pre-weakens the roof structure.

32:46.399 --> 32:48.199
Blue smoke is
a chemical ignition.

32:48.201 --> 32:50.234
It'll go up the central core
and total the building.

32:50.236 --> 32:53.404
We gotta get there and warn IC
before the whole thing comes down.

32:53.406 --> 32:55.440
[Sean over radio] <i>Hey, Chief,
I'm sure it's a spark.</i>

32:55.442 --> 32:57.575
<i>Tell your guys
to get out of the building now.</i>

32:57.577 --> 32:59.512
[sirens wailing]

33:03.583 --> 33:06.419
Make sure everyone's outta there.
Get 'em out, now.

33:21.434 --> 33:23.669
Move! Move!

33:23.671 --> 33:25.771
Give me the hose!
Give me the hose!

33:25.773 --> 33:27.173
Come on!

33:31.244 --> 33:32.746
Stay there! Don't move!

33:37.785 --> 33:40.187
Stop!

33:41.722 --> 33:43.524
I said, stop!

33:46.660 --> 33:47.994
Don't move!

33:50.464 --> 33:52.064
- Freeze!
- Dude! Son of a bitch!

33:52.066 --> 33:54.368
- Freeze! Freeze!
- [screams]

33:55.569 --> 33:57.569
Pull back.

33:57.571 --> 33:59.371
[man screams]

33:59.373 --> 34:02.441
I told you, if you ever do that
again, I will kill you!

34:02.443 --> 34:04.778
- You stupid, dumb, mother...
- Stop! Stop!

34:06.347 --> 34:07.847
- [groans]
- You pathetic...

34:07.849 --> 34:10.516
you for-hire torches,
you really think fire dances for you?

34:10.518 --> 34:12.484
Piece of shit!

34:12.485 --> 34:14.553
Geez, Sean!

34:14.554 --> 34:16.789
It's impossible to bust these assholes
without catchin' them in the act,

34:16.791 --> 34:18.858
and I had just about enough
of this piece of shit.

34:18.860 --> 34:21.092
Sean, get a medic!

34:21.094 --> 34:23.498
You hurt him.
Get an ambulance!

34:24.733 --> 34:27.867
So you really pre-weaken roof
beams on your fires, huh?

34:27.869 --> 34:31.739
It brings 'em down fast.
The clients like that.

34:33.742 --> 34:36.309
No roof also means an insurance
total on the building.

34:36.311 --> 34:37.777
It also traps firefighters.

34:37.779 --> 34:41.447
I only do commercial vacants.
I don't kill people.

34:41.449 --> 34:43.382
It's nice to know there's
still standards in the world.

34:43.385 --> 34:46.286
Yeah, not like that freak show
in Lincoln Park.

34:46.288 --> 34:47.420
[groans]

34:47.422 --> 34:49.257
The Halloween fire?

34:50.324 --> 34:53.525
I wouldn't touch that
for three times the fee.

34:53.527 --> 34:57.564
Did someone offer you a fee
for the Lincoln Park fires?

34:57.566 --> 34:59.534
Look, it was just in the wind.

35:01.303 --> 35:05.405
All right, but like I said,
I don't burn people.

35:05.407 --> 35:08.809
Our Sean-Fuckin'-McCaffrey has
torched more guys than I have.

35:08.811 --> 35:11.611
This offer in the wind,

35:11.613 --> 35:13.680
it say why it wanted
the nice house burned?

35:13.682 --> 35:16.618
This guy knew his arson.

35:18.688 --> 35:20.790
It was twisted stuff.

35:21.691 --> 35:24.424
[grunting]

35:24.426 --> 35:26.459
You and Matchstick Charlie
have a nice little chat?

35:26.461 --> 35:29.530
Somebody was tryin' to hire out
a burn on our townhouse.

35:29.532 --> 35:31.498
That pissant
said that to you?

35:31.500 --> 35:34.336
I wasn't the one pushin' him through
a window, so yeah, I guess so.

35:36.171 --> 35:39.440
Excuse me. I need to speak to the
guy they brought in from the fire?

35:39.442 --> 35:41.477
Not until
he's been treated.

35:42.445 --> 35:43.679
Okay.

35:44.580 --> 35:46.849
[man]
He won't talk to you.

35:48.718 --> 35:51.452
Oh, yeah? Why not?

35:51.454 --> 35:55.356
- Because I told him not to.
- Shit.

35:55.358 --> 35:58.459
There you go. Hi, Sean.

35:58.461 --> 36:01.462
- Who's this?
- This is Ronald Bartel,

36:01.464 --> 36:03.932
deadliest arsonist in the city
since Mrs. O'Leary's cow.

36:03.934 --> 36:06.367
Moo.

36:06.369 --> 36:09.436
Nursing homes, orphanages, probably a
hundred others we'll never know about

36:09.438 --> 36:12.608
since Ronald's specialty's
makin' them look like accidents.

36:13.609 --> 36:15.744
The littlest McCaffrey.

36:15.746 --> 36:17.979
You never came to see me.

36:17.981 --> 36:19.714
Your Uncle Brian did.

36:19.716 --> 36:22.751
So, what are you doin'
out of your cage, hmm?

36:22.753 --> 36:25.654
I hoarded a lot of sugar.

36:25.656 --> 36:27.856
Ate it all at once.

36:27.858 --> 36:29.591
I'm diabetic.

36:29.593 --> 36:33.628
It's my secret
get-out-of-jail-free card.

36:33.630 --> 36:36.698
Sit.
We have so much to talk about.

36:36.700 --> 36:38.167
Yeah.

36:40.637 --> 36:42.372
Lincoln Park?

36:44.675 --> 36:46.574
[laughs]

36:46.576 --> 36:49.944
You can't make your fire
work, can you?

36:49.946 --> 36:52.781
You know in your bones
it has to be arson,

36:52.783 --> 36:56.618
but you can't prove it,
and that's eating you alive.

36:56.620 --> 36:58.720
- Go wait in the truck.
- What?

36:58.722 --> 37:00.655
Do it.

37:00.657 --> 37:02.559
This is absurd.

37:04.695 --> 37:06.861
She's an arson
investigator?

37:06.863 --> 37:09.932
No!
She doesn't have the look.

37:09.934 --> 37:12.667
Not like Rimgale did.

37:12.669 --> 37:14.870
Not like you do.

37:14.872 --> 37:17.006
How do you know
about my fire?

37:17.008 --> 37:20.644
Oh, there are lots of us around and about
who have an interest in such things.

37:21.746 --> 37:24.714
Some are guests of the State,
but some are not.

37:24.716 --> 37:29.284
And some of them are surprisingly
good at hacking databases.

37:29.286 --> 37:31.620
OFI's, for instance.

37:31.622 --> 37:37.560
They hacked OFI's photos, reports,
conjectures, and then they share them.

37:37.562 --> 37:38.828
Yeah.

37:38.830 --> 37:42.898
Want to share with me, Sean?
Come on.

37:42.900 --> 37:44.700
[chuckles]

37:44.702 --> 37:46.971
All right, I'll share first.

37:48.306 --> 37:50.606
Lincoln Park.

37:50.608 --> 37:52.675
I read OFI's report,

37:52.677 --> 37:55.745
and they said...
[chuckling]

37:55.747 --> 37:58.948
there was
a "single ignition source."

37:58.950 --> 38:01.951
That's idiocy.

38:01.953 --> 38:04.787
Didn't they look at your pictures?
I did.

38:04.789 --> 38:08.858
So much heat, Sean,
driven through the ducting so fast

38:08.860 --> 38:13.696
that it gobbled up enough oxygen
to create a backdraft.

38:13.698 --> 38:17.733
Somebody's got a secret
in there.

38:17.735 --> 38:20.669
And you know what, Ronald?
You're gonna tell me.

38:20.671 --> 38:22.873
[laughs]

38:22.875 --> 38:25.742
No. Sharing's a process,

38:25.744 --> 38:28.479
and we take turns.

38:30.582 --> 38:32.816
That was my turn to share.

38:32.818 --> 38:34.885
Now it's yours.

38:34.887 --> 38:39.057
I want you to share with me
a fire at, um...

38:40.993 --> 38:44.060
West Haddon Street.
[laughs]

38:44.062 --> 38:47.130
By the time you finally
cornered Wicek in there,

38:47.132 --> 38:49.733
he'd burned down
how many churches by then?

38:49.735 --> 38:51.568
Eight, right?

38:51.570 --> 38:54.070
You paused when you saw it,
didn't you?

38:54.072 --> 38:58.542
Just for an instant.
Just to admire it.

38:58.544 --> 39:03.814
Because Wicek had created
a... a real work of art.

39:03.816 --> 39:06.083
And he brought out the dragon.

39:06.085 --> 39:11.055
The dragon was talking to you,
Sean, and you were listening,

39:11.057 --> 39:15.061
and you understood
what the dragon was saying.

39:15.829 --> 39:17.128
Huh, sure...

39:17.130 --> 39:19.565
sure you paused.

39:20.666 --> 39:22.634
You couldn't resist.

39:23.837 --> 39:27.939
[gasped]
God, to have been there.

39:27.941 --> 39:31.578
The greatest arson duel
in history.

39:33.680 --> 39:37.081
Oh. Oh. Oh.

39:37.083 --> 39:39.986
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.

39:41.588 --> 39:44.991
Mm. I have one more question.

39:46.092 --> 39:49.028
Isn't it my turn
for questions?

39:50.196 --> 39:53.967
Yeah. Okay. All right.
I'll ask it after.

39:55.602 --> 39:59.971
To get that much heat moving
that fast through the ducting

39:59.973 --> 40:03.943
would've required the laying out
of additional accelerant.

40:05.011 --> 40:07.881
But you didn't see
any signs of that, did you?

40:08.848 --> 40:11.682
So, the answer had to be,

40:11.684 --> 40:13.720
a second ignition source.

40:15.890 --> 40:19.960
But you looked for it and you
couldn't find it, could you?

40:20.961 --> 40:24.196
And you checked for everything.

40:24.198 --> 40:27.167
Absolutely everything.

40:28.869 --> 40:33.038
Did you check for
celluloid and mercury?

40:33.040 --> 40:35.707
[laughs]

40:35.709 --> 40:38.143
See?
Sharing can be good for you.

40:38.145 --> 40:42.214
W-W-Wait!
I said I had a question!

40:42.216 --> 40:45.753
I know how lonely it can be
for a person like you.

40:49.023 --> 40:50.923
Did you and Ronald
catch up on old times?

40:50.925 --> 40:54.026
Hey, listen.
Those circular burns on the ducts?

40:54.028 --> 40:58.163
They were made by a one-time cell
igniter powered by a micro-battery.

40:58.165 --> 41:01.900
It was consumed by the fire.
I can't believe I missed it.

41:01.902 --> 41:03.169
Okay.

41:03.171 --> 41:04.738
Let's go.

41:08.043 --> 41:09.843
[echoing] <i>Sean.</i>

41:11.845 --> 41:13.148
<i>Sean.</i>

41:14.915 --> 41:17.150
[Sean]
<i>Ghosts with fire-like eyes.</i>

41:17.152 --> 41:19.685
Sean!

41:19.687 --> 41:21.056
<i>They're me.</i>

41:22.123 --> 41:25.825
- <i>I'm them.</i>
- [echoing] <i>Sean!</i>

41:25.827 --> 41:26.993
<i>Sean.</i>

41:26.995 --> 41:30.063
[dog barking]

41:30.065 --> 41:34.100
Dodged Animal Control
one more night, huh?

41:34.102 --> 41:36.269
What are you doin', huh?

41:36.271 --> 41:37.939
[barks]

41:40.108 --> 41:42.677
- Really?
- [dog whimpers]

41:47.215 --> 41:49.017
[dog barking]

42:01.563 --> 42:04.964
So, you start
in the air-con unit,

42:04.966 --> 42:07.969
slow, findin' your rhythm.

42:09.804 --> 42:11.840
Then you're led
through the ducts.

42:13.775 --> 42:17.079
You're hungry.
You know it's bait, but you bite.

42:18.880 --> 42:23.718
BZ, second cellulose igniter kept you
travelin' through the ducts at speed.

42:26.222 --> 42:29.025
But you never managed
a gulp of air.

42:31.861 --> 42:35.095
A house this old, this loose?

42:35.097 --> 42:37.831
You should've gotten
around a window,

42:37.833 --> 42:40.870
a chink in the wall,
found more oxygen and kept goin'.

42:43.139 --> 42:45.005
Something trapped you.

42:45.007 --> 42:46.874
[voice]
<i>Made you lose your mind.</i>

42:46.876 --> 42:49.745
Strangled you,
made you lose your mind.

42:52.114 --> 42:55.117
Left you lyin' here
silently for hours...

42:56.986 --> 43:00.020
a thousand degrees,
all dressed up, nowhere to go.

43:00.022 --> 43:01.822
[voice] <i>Nowhere to go.</i>

43:01.824 --> 43:03.893
[dog whimpering]

43:06.829 --> 43:09.197
What you got? Huh?

43:09.199 --> 43:12.835
What you got?
You smellin' something strange?

43:18.041 --> 43:21.042
That's how they trapped you.

43:21.044 --> 43:24.915
They sealed off the air and turned
the whole room into a frustration box.

43:26.316 --> 43:30.151
You always do off-duty investigations
in the middle of the night?

43:30.153 --> 43:32.821
It's the way I work.
What's your excuse?

43:32.823 --> 43:34.255
Oh, you have a dog?

43:34.257 --> 43:38.126
A stray.
A stray with skills, apparently.

43:38.128 --> 43:39.394
The stray have a name?

43:39.396 --> 43:42.831
Well, if he had a name,
he'd be mine.

43:42.833 --> 43:45.333
You know,
I kept checkin' on you.

43:45.335 --> 43:48.203
Nobody likes to talk about it
though, right?

43:48.205 --> 43:52.173
Big hero, saving a kid
not once but twice

43:52.175 --> 43:54.911
before you even had three years on?
[scoffs]

43:56.279 --> 43:59.315
I mean,
articles in <i>The Tribune,</i> awards.

43:59.317 --> 44:01.985
Face of the new department.

44:02.986 --> 44:06.154
But if you sniff hard enough,
and I did,

44:06.156 --> 44:09.092
it turns out there's this
whole other story, right?

44:10.128 --> 44:12.361
This firefighter
who starts stealin' things

44:12.363 --> 44:14.296
from the apartments
she's been fightin' fires in.

44:14.298 --> 44:16.198
I mean, come on, man.
What is that?

44:16.200 --> 44:19.237
That's like bein' a fuckin'
child molester on this job.

44:20.972 --> 44:23.239
What was it? Hmm?

44:23.241 --> 44:25.241
All that attention,

44:25.243 --> 44:28.179
all those expectations make you wanna
do bad things and hurt yourself?

44:29.447 --> 44:32.948
You know what? You got just enough
juice from all those awards,

44:32.950 --> 44:37.319
they give you one last shot and move
you away from Suppression and into OFI,

44:37.321 --> 44:39.121
because we don't
do charity here, right?

44:39.123 --> 44:40.489
You don't know me.

44:40.491 --> 44:42.391
Oh, but I think I can guess.

44:42.393 --> 44:46.495
Yeah? Maybe you know all about
the, uh, pressure of rumors.

44:46.497 --> 44:48.166
Ah.

44:59.243 --> 45:01.243
Plumber's putty.

45:01.245 --> 45:03.513
They sealed off the air
exchange points with it.

45:03.515 --> 45:05.181
Burns clean under the heat.

45:05.183 --> 45:07.517
I would've missed it
if it weren't for that mutt.

45:07.519 --> 45:10.487
So they wanted the house
interior to burn completely.

45:10.489 --> 45:12.157
Yeah.

45:14.992 --> 45:17.962
I got nowhere else
to go, okay?

45:19.331 --> 45:20.997
Nowhere.

45:20.999 --> 45:24.000
And what do you want me
to do about it?

45:24.002 --> 45:25.437
I can be good at this.

45:26.305 --> 45:28.373
Okay. All right.

45:29.308 --> 45:32.244
What does all this
say to you? Hmm?

45:34.479 --> 45:39.015
That it's a hell of a lot of trouble just
to go after a couple that wasn't even home.

45:39.017 --> 45:41.987
Yeah, you see I don't think
it was ever about the owners.

45:43.121 --> 45:45.924
I think it was
about the house itself.

45:47.359 --> 45:51.029
Somebody didn't need it
burned, they needed it erased.

45:52.130 --> 45:54.967
Now, why don't you go home
and think about that?

45:57.035 --> 45:58.937
I'll see ya tomorrow.

46:07.179 --> 46:09.547
So you got anything
on the Hunters or not?

46:09.549 --> 46:12.082
Like I e-mailed
your partner here,

46:12.084 --> 46:15.586
some chaotic finances, mainly to do
with their tech company, Hunter Systems.

46:15.588 --> 46:18.522
What does, uh,
Hunter Systems make?

46:18.524 --> 46:22.395
A subcontractor
in some kind of, uh, NATO...

46:23.363 --> 46:25.162
Where the hell is it?

46:25.164 --> 46:28.366
NATO AIM-120 missile upgrade.

46:28.368 --> 46:32.536
There have been quality control
issues over DOD quality specs.

46:32.538 --> 46:34.372
Hunters have been
shifting money around,

46:34.374 --> 46:37.308
trying to keep the company going
until they can sort it out.

46:37.310 --> 46:39.143
They're in trouble,
they're not.

46:39.145 --> 46:43.116
The DOD, the DA and the feds
can't seem make up their minds.

46:48.388 --> 46:53.391
We've been over this with the police
and our project supervisors at DOD.

46:53.393 --> 46:57.862
Nobody's seen or heard from Jan and Rod
Hunter since the fire at their townhouse.

46:57.864 --> 47:00.865
Did Rodger Hunter normally spend
a lot of time at the office?

47:00.867 --> 47:03.301
Depended on where we were
in development.

47:03.303 --> 47:04.603
It's his company.

47:04.605 --> 47:07.372
Were they havin' problems
with production?

47:07.374 --> 47:09.541
I can't get into specifics,

47:09.543 --> 47:13.545
but there were redesign requests on
the missile's seeker head optics.

47:13.547 --> 47:16.415
That's the part of
the AIM-120 we do.

47:16.417 --> 47:18.883
And then there was the fire,
of course.

47:18.885 --> 47:20.321
Fire?

47:22.589 --> 47:24.523
On our test bed.

47:24.525 --> 47:26.158
[beeps]

47:26.160 --> 47:28.427
The techs were doing
our first integrated run

47:28.429 --> 47:32.331
on a fully functional prototype
of the new AIM Rathyeon sent over.

47:32.333 --> 47:35.233
Unfortunately, a fire
broke out after-hours,

47:35.235 --> 47:37.436
and the prototype
was destroyed.

47:37.438 --> 47:41.473
It's caused a delay
and slowed our cash flow.

47:41.475 --> 47:43.241
Were you insured?

47:43.243 --> 47:47.346
Of course. The fire was
determined accidental.

47:47.348 --> 47:52.284
Our insurance company though,
have been slow in our payments.

47:52.286 --> 47:55.253
- Why?
- They're an insurance company.

47:55.255 --> 47:57.189
Who investigated
the fire?

47:57.191 --> 48:00.460
We're in a small suburb here
with a volunteer fire department.

48:00.462 --> 48:02.462
They don't have
an arson office.

48:02.464 --> 48:06.532
Since we're on a fed contract
they sent someone over from ATF.

48:06.534 --> 48:08.403
ATF guy
have a name?

48:09.704 --> 48:11.704
Ralph Kunz.

48:11.706 --> 48:14.476
I think we're gonna need to
have a look at that fire scene.

48:22.350 --> 48:24.384
Banged itself inside

48:24.386 --> 48:26.619
lookin' for a breath of air just
like the Hunter's townhouse.

48:26.621 --> 48:28.621
Can I use the word?

48:28.623 --> 48:30.325
Backdraft?

48:31.226 --> 48:32.660
Guess we just did.

48:36.398 --> 48:39.232
Show me where the investigator
tagged the origin of the fire?

48:39.234 --> 48:40.635
Over there.

48:42.637 --> 48:44.237
What is it?

48:44.239 --> 48:47.173
A cooling plant.

48:47.175 --> 48:49.710
Rocket was unarmed,
of course.

48:49.712 --> 48:52.512
The solid fuel
went off in the heat.

48:52.514 --> 48:55.116
There was basically
nothing left after.

49:08.397 --> 49:10.296
Why do I think
if we scrape this,

49:10.298 --> 49:13.534
we're gonna find traces
of BZ and linoleum?

49:13.536 --> 49:16.737
Kinda convenient the building
happens to go off

49:16.739 --> 49:19.406
when they have
a missile prototype in there.

49:19.408 --> 49:21.275
Why burn their own building?

49:21.277 --> 49:22.676
Well,
if the Department of Defense

49:22.678 --> 49:25.379
were havin'
quality control issues,

49:25.381 --> 49:27.714
it could slow down
an investigation.

49:27.716 --> 49:29.716
Insurance money
would help hold 'em over.

49:29.718 --> 49:33.220
Only the insurance company
is slowly walkin' a payment.

49:33.222 --> 49:37.359
It's probably because they're as suspicious
of Kunz's "accidental" call as we are.

49:46.469 --> 49:48.637
[siren chirping]

49:52.575 --> 49:54.241
- McCaffrey.
- <i>Doyle.</i>

49:54.243 --> 49:58.680
<i>Auto fire you might be interested
in, in a lot right now off Kensey.</i>

49:58.682 --> 50:01.484
- <i>Just saying.</i>
- Copy that. We're on our way.

50:06.656 --> 50:09.323
- That the Hunters?
- It's their car.

50:09.325 --> 50:11.392
Gonna take dental or DNA
to confirm their ID,

50:11.394 --> 50:13.361
but I'm takin' bets on yes.

50:13.363 --> 50:16.831
Probably lured here to meet
someone, or they were dumped.

50:16.833 --> 50:19.634
Passing uniforms came
on it already burning.

50:19.636 --> 50:22.205
- If it burns, it's yours.
- Yeah.

50:23.840 --> 50:26.574
Easy.
It's still a crime scene.

50:26.576 --> 50:28.743
Jesus, Kunz,
you're like a bad penny.

50:28.745 --> 50:31.646
You wanna tell me what you're doin'
nosin' around a car fire in my city?

50:31.648 --> 50:36.319
Talk to the badge.
The gold federal one over there.

50:44.394 --> 50:45.493
McCaffrey.

50:45.495 --> 50:47.230
Agent Johnson.

50:48.632 --> 50:52.100
Is there someplace around here
we could get something to eat?

50:52.102 --> 50:57.338
You know Hunter Systems was on the bankruptcy
bubble with this missile subcontract.

50:57.340 --> 51:00.542
Rod Hunter was grabbing money anywhere
he could to keep the doors open.

51:00.544 --> 51:03.478
Hang on. So you're thinkin' insurance
fraud on the fire that burned the missile?

51:03.480 --> 51:05.581
Oh, I'm pretty sure
Hunter had somebody light it,

51:05.583 --> 51:07.716
regardless what
the ATF comes up with,

51:07.718 --> 51:10.419
but not for the insurance.

51:10.421 --> 51:13.822
The AIM-120 missile
was a big deal.

51:13.824 --> 51:18.661
Next-gen seeker heads could take
out any peer air force fighter.

51:18.663 --> 51:20.563
Thank you.

51:20.565 --> 51:24.333
A lot of alarm bells went off
in the Pentagon after the fire.

51:24.335 --> 51:26.335
DOD inspectors
swarmed the place,

51:26.337 --> 51:28.671
did a thorough on the
missile parts that survived.

51:28.673 --> 51:32.641
There wasn't much, but enough to spot
that what had burned in that test bed

51:32.643 --> 51:36.380
was a mock-up substituted
for the real prototype.

51:41.619 --> 51:43.485
Then cue the wife.

51:43.487 --> 51:46.355
Soon as she realizes
DOD isn't buyin' the switch,

51:46.357 --> 51:48.825
she walks into my office
and cops to the whole thing.

51:48.827 --> 51:51.493
How her husband
planned to shop the real one,

51:51.495 --> 51:53.830
with all its spooky
next generation technology,

51:53.832 --> 51:55.832
to certain unsavory middlemen

51:55.834 --> 51:58.835
who would then market its specs
to any unpleasant foreign entities

51:58.837 --> 52:00.870
willing to pay
plenty for them.

52:00.872 --> 52:03.940
Wait, hang on. So, uh, Hunter handed
over the missile to these middlemen?

52:03.942 --> 52:05.542
That's the thing.

52:05.544 --> 52:06.876
Turns out the wife
moved it someplace else

52:06.878 --> 52:08.545
without telling her husband,

52:08.547 --> 52:10.580
or that she'd come to us
for a deal.

52:10.582 --> 52:12.414
She promised us
all the evidence,

52:12.416 --> 52:13.917
and the missile's location
on a hard drive,

52:13.919 --> 52:15.518
in exchange
for immunity.

52:15.520 --> 52:16.886
And then
they disappeared.

52:16.888 --> 52:20.824
So, our unsavory middlemen
probably paid Rod,

52:20.826 --> 52:25.428
and when he couldn't deliver the
prototype 'cause wifey moved it...

52:25.430 --> 52:28.531
Well, I'm imagining they worked them over
pretty good before lighting up that car.

52:28.533 --> 52:31.468
- Yeah, right.
- Which I'm guessing also means

52:31.470 --> 52:33.470
she probably told them
where the missile really was.

52:33.472 --> 52:35.872
But, given their bodies
were only dumped today,

52:35.874 --> 52:38.408
they may have been
on the run till now,

52:38.410 --> 52:41.711
which means it's possible our bad guys
haven't yet been able to move the prototype.

52:41.713 --> 52:43.914
With something that big,
you can't just put it in checked luggage.

52:43.916 --> 52:47.550
They're gonna have to move it through
a shipping port to a third country.

52:47.552 --> 52:50.754
And we've got devices that can sniff
out hydroxyl polybutadiene propellant

52:50.756 --> 52:52.589
deployed at all
likely exit points.

52:52.591 --> 52:54.825
Hang on. There's no way
they found the hard drive.

52:54.827 --> 52:56.693
That's why
they used a backdraft.

52:56.695 --> 52:59.429
Okay, look, backdraft cooks
for hours before it blows,

52:59.431 --> 53:01.732
thoroughly incinerates
any evidence inside.

53:01.734 --> 53:03.834
They had to be sure.

53:03.836 --> 53:06.671
It's possible they killed her before
she said anything about working with us.

53:06.673 --> 53:09.907
If so, we want
their guard down enough,

53:09.909 --> 53:12.543
we can catch them when
they try to move the prototype.

53:12.545 --> 53:14.244
Five kids
died in that fire.

53:14.246 --> 53:16.514
I wanna catch the assholes
that did it.

53:16.516 --> 53:18.849
Not declaring it arson, at least not
yet, will help me do that.

53:18.851 --> 53:20.818
Oh, and I suppose
it not being arson

53:20.820 --> 53:23.921
spares the DOD and its contractors
from havin' to publicly explain

53:23.923 --> 53:28.726
that they let slip a top secret missile to our
country's enemies has got nothin' to do with it?

53:28.728 --> 53:30.895
Come on.
Accidental fire, I imagine,

53:30.897 --> 53:33.264
makes a whole lot of
conversations go away, right?

53:33.266 --> 53:35.700
Look,
we want the same thing as you.

53:35.702 --> 53:38.738
You know, it's funny.
When people say that, they don't.

53:44.844 --> 53:46.779
What the heck?

53:48.781 --> 53:51.049
Ah, somebody's been here.

53:51.051 --> 53:55.221
Coin flip, it was our FBI buddies
lookin' for the hard drive.

53:57.024 --> 53:59.490
You know, I don't care
what the Hunters were doin'

53:59.492 --> 54:02.761
with their money
or their missile,

54:02.763 --> 54:05.565
but when someone chose fire
to cover their tracks...

54:06.033 --> 54:07.901
they made a big mistake.

54:18.712 --> 54:20.781
I'm sorry for your loss.

54:24.051 --> 54:25.586
Eric.

54:27.821 --> 54:29.723
Such a sweet child.

54:31.725 --> 54:34.559
So bright.

54:34.561 --> 54:38.265
You could never be mad at him.
You were too busy laughing.

54:42.070 --> 54:43.871
When we moved here...

54:44.938 --> 54:47.875
Eric made fast friends
with my son.

54:48.977 --> 54:51.612
Hey. Hey.

54:52.513 --> 54:55.016
Did you, uh, know the Hunters?

54:56.550 --> 54:59.720
Eric did.
Me and him...

55:00.755 --> 55:03.557
we used to get cookies
from her sometimes.

55:05.359 --> 55:08.029
Were you ever at the house?

55:09.063 --> 55:11.998
We buried our dinosaurs there,

55:12.000 --> 55:15.701
but Mrs. Hunter got really,
really mad at us.

55:15.703 --> 55:18.638
So, she said that
if we wanted to dig,

55:18.640 --> 55:21.707
we had to go
play in the park.

55:21.709 --> 55:24.846
The kid was right.
Dug it out of the Hunter's yard.

55:27.949 --> 55:30.016
Looks water-damaged.

55:30.018 --> 55:33.853
Get Doyle's I.T. guy on the phone
and see what he can pull off this.

55:33.855 --> 55:35.990
And tell him
to keep a lid on it for now.

55:37.759 --> 55:40.660
So, do I get detective points
for finding the hard drive?

55:40.662 --> 55:43.865
Well, a few more and I might try
harder to remember your name.

55:45.567 --> 55:46.933
- [vibrating]
- [man on TV] <i>We treat canines</i>

55:46.935 --> 55:48.601
<i>as if they are
fellow human beings</i>

55:48.603 --> 55:53.806

01:09:41.917 --> 01:09:43.618
Hey, Mom.

01:09:56.031 --> 01:09:57.431
I'm okay.

01:09:57.433 --> 01:09:59.966
[car horns honking]

01:09:59.968 --> 01:10:01.837
[door slamming]

01:10:09.912 --> 01:10:12.446
All his visitors,
last 12 months.

01:10:12.448 --> 01:10:13.682
Okay.

01:10:20.956 --> 01:10:22.756
- So who are you?
- [knocking]

01:10:22.758 --> 01:10:26.462
[Ronald]
Do I hear a McCaffrey out there?

01:10:27.796 --> 01:10:29.830
Where are you going, Sean?

01:10:29.832 --> 01:10:33.533
You going back
to West Haddon Street?

01:10:33.535 --> 01:10:35.535
Sean?

01:10:35.537 --> 01:10:37.239
- Sean!
- [door buzzing]

01:10:38.707 --> 01:10:41.743
[horn blaring]

01:10:41.745 --> 01:10:43.579
[Ronald]
<i>Sean!</i>

01:10:44.714 --> 01:10:45.949
[echoing] <i>Sean.</i>

01:10:47.549 --> 01:10:49.451
<i>Sean!</i>

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:52.689
<i>Sean?</i>

01:10:54.924 --> 01:10:57.725
What? Were all
the bowling alleys closed?

01:10:57.727 --> 01:11:02.563
Department's tryin' to declare
the Hunter fire "Undetermined."

01:11:02.565 --> 01:11:04.732
- You kidding me?
- If the evidence isn't there...

01:11:04.734 --> 01:11:06.801
Hey, I wasn't talkin' to you.

01:11:06.803 --> 01:11:09.771
Listen, I'm investigator of record here.
I'm not gonna sign off on that.

01:11:09.773 --> 01:11:12.640
You're not the lead
on the case anymore, Sean.

01:11:12.642 --> 01:11:14.575
But you can't do that,
not without cause.

01:11:14.577 --> 01:11:16.479
That spark
you dangled out the window,

01:11:17.347 --> 01:11:18.746
he filed
a battery complaint.

01:11:18.748 --> 01:11:21.083
- Fuckin' Christ, this is bullshit!
- Yeah?

01:11:21.085 --> 01:11:23.885
Plus they got witnesses that overheard
Rening yellin' at you about it.

01:11:23.887 --> 01:11:26.754
- That wasn't... Look, I didn't mean...
- The guy's a fuckin' arsonist.

01:11:26.756 --> 01:11:29.624
He lit the building that burned him.
But whatever, okay?

01:11:29.626 --> 01:11:31.692
Let him file.
I'll beat it with my eyes closed.

01:11:31.694 --> 01:11:34.529
- Just don't take me off my burn.
- Already done.

01:11:34.531 --> 01:11:36.932
- Kunz.
- I swear to fuckin' God.

01:11:36.934 --> 01:11:40.035
Soto wants more liaison
between OFI and ATF anyway,

01:11:40.037 --> 01:11:42.037
so he's gonna let them
run with it for now.

01:11:42.039 --> 01:11:45.542
- With this asshole?
- Two guys walk in, one walks out.

01:11:46.811 --> 01:11:49.847
I'm not happy about it either, okay?
At all.

01:11:51.148 --> 01:11:53.381
But, for now,
it's done.

01:11:53.383 --> 01:11:56.652
You're on admin leave until they make
a determination on the battery...

01:11:56.654 --> 01:11:57.922
Damn it!

01:11:58.823 --> 01:12:00.122
Fucking everybody!

01:12:00.124 --> 01:12:02.891
Everybody from Chief Soto
to the FBI

01:12:02.893 --> 01:12:06.762
to the whole goddamn world wants
this to be anything but arson.

01:12:06.764 --> 01:12:09.731
Everybody but the mothers
of those children.

01:12:09.733 --> 01:12:13.068
[sighs] Come on, Brian.
Don't do this. I am so close.

01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:15.904
Maybe if you bit your tongue
every once in a while,

01:12:15.906 --> 01:12:19.043
your career dissipation light
wouldn't be flashin' right now.

01:12:20.678 --> 01:12:22.145
The trouble with
bitin' my tongue is

01:12:22.147 --> 01:12:24.815
I always seem to end up
with a mouthful of blood.

01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:27.718
Take some time, Sean.

01:12:28.153 --> 01:12:30.088
- Cool off.
- Whatever.

01:12:33.724 --> 01:12:35.060
Fucker!

01:12:41.833 --> 01:12:43.902
[line ringing]

01:12:49.741 --> 01:12:52.008
[woman on phone]
<i>Hey. Is everything okay?</i>

01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:54.110
[Sean on phone] <i>Hey.</i>

01:12:54.112 --> 01:12:57.048
<i>Can we just stay in tonight?
I need to see you.</i>

01:13:01.953 --> 01:13:05.590
- [dog panting]
- Can they really do that?

01:13:07.092 --> 01:13:09.895
- Guess they just did.
- [dog whimpering]

01:13:13.198 --> 01:13:16.733
Did you ever crack
what those numbers were?

01:13:16.735 --> 01:13:18.801
Nope.
Just a part of it,

01:13:18.803 --> 01:13:20.237
a bunch of locations
across the city,

01:13:20.239 --> 01:13:22.874
but we don't even know
how they connect.

01:13:26.478 --> 01:13:28.880
Did anyone suggest
cell tower loggings?

01:13:30.482 --> 01:13:32.016
What do you mean?

01:13:32.018 --> 01:13:35.752
Just something I saw
on oil projects in Saudi.

01:13:35.754 --> 01:13:37.154
Rather than guard
every project,

01:13:37.156 --> 01:13:40.057
they would put trackers
on the machinery.

01:13:40.059 --> 01:13:42.026
Hang on, what?

01:13:42.028 --> 01:13:45.963
They had built-in accelerometers
that activated when it was moved.

01:13:45.965 --> 01:13:49.769
When it got in range of a cell
tower, it would start phoning home.

01:13:50.937 --> 01:13:52.838
This looks at lot
like the same thing.

01:13:54.206 --> 01:13:57.775
Did the Hunters put a cell-based
tracker on the crate you're looking for?

01:13:57.777 --> 01:14:00.445
Uh, I don't know.
The wife might've done.

01:14:01.814 --> 01:14:05.082
Hey. Listen, can you, uh,
check with a cell phone company,

01:14:05.084 --> 01:14:08.986
see if any of those numbers
you sent me match towers.

01:14:08.988 --> 01:14:12.189
Yeah, all right,
call me back.

01:14:12.191 --> 01:14:14.024
Are they gonna run it down?

01:14:14.026 --> 01:14:16.126
Hopefully.
I'm not allowed near it for now.

01:14:16.128 --> 01:14:18.731
But Christ, Jenny,
that's amazing.

01:14:19.932 --> 01:14:22.132
- [kisses]
- [dog yelps]

01:14:22.134 --> 01:14:23.734
Have you
named him yet?

01:14:23.736 --> 01:14:25.938
Well, if he had a name,
he'd be mine.

01:14:27.807 --> 01:14:29.475
- [beeping]
- [object clicks]

01:14:31.877 --> 01:14:33.713
[dog whimpering]

01:14:40.253 --> 01:14:42.222
[whining]

01:14:45.092 --> 01:14:46.860
What is it?

01:14:49.229 --> 01:14:50.864
[whimpers]

01:14:52.232 --> 01:14:54.966
Hey. Hey, wake up.

01:14:54.968 --> 01:14:56.502
- [groans]
- Wake up.

01:15:03.210 --> 01:15:05.078
Oh, shit.

01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:11.316
[groans]

01:15:11.318 --> 01:15:14.353
Hey, Jenny. Jenny, wake up.

01:15:14.355 --> 01:15:16.988
Mm. What?

01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:18.957
- Hey, wake up.
- What's going on? What's that smell?

01:15:18.959 --> 01:15:20.992
- Hey! Don't move.
- What?

01:15:20.994 --> 01:15:22.929
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

01:15:24.097 --> 01:15:26.998
That's gas. It's comin' up
through the floorboards.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.001
Look at me.
I'm not fuckin' around, okay?

01:15:30.003 --> 01:15:32.338
There's a contact switch
under the bed that's just set.

01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:34.606
- If we get up, it's gonna blow...
- Blow?

01:15:34.608 --> 01:15:37.176
- [clicks]
- Easy. Listen to me.

01:15:37.178 --> 01:15:39.778
Now, I can keep
my weight on it, okay?

01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:43.149
And you can ease out,
but take it slow.

01:15:43.151 --> 01:15:44.816
Okay?

01:15:44.818 --> 01:15:47.889
You can do it. Slow. Go on.

01:15:48.923 --> 01:15:50.291
Go on.

01:15:51.893 --> 01:15:54.026
Easy, easy,
easy, easy, easy!

01:15:54.028 --> 01:15:55.995
Let me get over.

01:15:55.997 --> 01:15:57.098
There you go.

01:15:57.899 --> 01:15:59.000
Easy.

01:16:00.301 --> 01:16:02.134
Okay, stop, stop, stop.

01:16:02.136 --> 01:16:03.938
All right.
All right, come on.

01:16:08.276 --> 01:16:11.310
- Okay, now get outta here and call the fire station.
- What, just leave you here?

01:16:11.312 --> 01:16:13.279
- Jenny, listen to me.
- I-I can't.

01:16:13.281 --> 01:16:15.147
Listen to me!

01:16:15.149 --> 01:16:17.917
The sooner you make that call,
the better chance I have, okay?

01:16:17.919 --> 01:16:19.587
Go! Come on!

01:16:20.288 --> 01:16:24.092
Goddamn it. Fuck.

01:16:27.128 --> 01:16:29.597
You could've warned me earlier.

01:16:30.399 --> 01:16:32.232
Don't look at me like that.

01:16:32.234 --> 01:16:34.367
Odds would've been better at the
pound, pal. Just sayin'.

01:16:34.369 --> 01:16:37.306
[sirens wailing]

01:16:44.679 --> 01:16:46.848
- He's in the bedroom.
- Stay out here.

01:16:53.055 --> 01:16:54.857
Oh shit, Sean.

01:16:55.290 --> 01:16:57.390
Engine 36 is on the way.

01:16:57.392 --> 01:16:59.459
- What, Hector?
- Second shift. Masey.

01:16:59.461 --> 01:17:01.361
- Okay.
- Oh, shit.

01:17:01.363 --> 01:17:03.230
They got you all
rigged up down here.

01:17:03.232 --> 01:17:06.099
[sniffs]
Is that gas?

01:17:06.101 --> 01:17:08.168
Yeah, they probably tricked it
from the stove line

01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:12.005
into a shaped pocket to blow
upwards when it's released.

01:17:12.007 --> 01:17:15.142
- What do I do?
- I try not to think about what you're gonna do.

01:17:15.144 --> 01:17:17.344
Hey! No, wait.
Where are you goin'?

01:17:17.346 --> 01:17:19.913
- I'm gonna try and cut it off at the main.
- No. Don't.

01:17:19.915 --> 01:17:23.016
They probably booby-trapped it in case I
smelled the gas before the plate timer set.

01:17:23.018 --> 01:17:25.185
Listen, if Masey knows
what he's doing,

01:17:25.187 --> 01:17:27.888
he can use his shoring blocks
to slowly replace my weight

01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:29.390
and get me off it
before the plate timer...

01:17:29.392 --> 01:17:31.725
- [clicking]
- Oh, shit!

01:17:31.727 --> 01:17:33.361
- What'd you do?
- I don't know.

01:17:33.363 --> 01:17:35.729
Maybe-Maybe there's a secondary timer.
I'm not sure.

01:17:35.731 --> 01:17:38.232
I'm gonna shut it off
down here.

01:17:38.234 --> 01:17:39.500
Brian, get out!

01:17:39.502 --> 01:17:41.435
Brian, just get out
of the building!

01:17:41.437 --> 01:17:44.238
Just do me a favor.
Shut up and don't move.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:48.075
No, Brian,
don't be stupid. Get out!

01:17:48.077 --> 01:17:50.011
I'm gonna draw the gas
down here away from you.

01:17:50.013 --> 01:17:51.312
No! Brian, get out the building!

01:17:51.314 --> 01:17:53.514
I'm not letting
another McCaffrey die.

01:17:53.516 --> 01:17:56.083
Listen to me. You'll watch two
if you don't get out now!

01:17:56.085 --> 01:17:58.421
Sorry. Not again.

01:18:05.028 --> 01:18:06.362
Brian! Get out!

01:18:16.973 --> 01:18:19.008
[echoing] Brian!

01:18:20.143 --> 01:18:22.143
[beeps]

01:18:22.145 --> 01:18:23.378
[no audible dialogue]

01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:29.320
[choir vocalizing]

01:18:43.267 --> 01:18:45.334
[man] Present arms!

01:18:45.336 --> 01:18:48.072
[bagpipes blowing]

01:19:19.303 --> 01:19:22.006
[bagpipes continue]

01:19:30.615 --> 01:19:32.250
[sobbing]

01:20:04.482 --> 01:20:07.083
You were right.

01:20:07.085 --> 01:20:09.187
The numbers correspond
to cell towers.

01:20:10.255 --> 01:20:11.487
We monitored the frequency.

01:20:11.489 --> 01:20:13.556
The last few hits
have been near Calumet.

01:20:13.558 --> 01:20:17.661
It must be far from the tower because
the search circle is way too large.

01:20:17.663 --> 01:20:20.631
Takes in half the storage areas
south of the city.

01:20:20.633 --> 01:20:23.534
Nobody's got the manpower to
search that many storage yards.

01:20:23.536 --> 01:20:28.539
And with the ATF on the fire and Kunz's
"undetermined" call, we got no writ.

01:20:28.541 --> 01:20:31.107
It's up to the feds now.

01:20:31.109 --> 01:20:33.577
Look, to hell with
downtown and the feds.

01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:35.046
Orders or not...

01:20:36.449 --> 01:20:39.050
whatever you want,
whatever you need...

01:20:40.319 --> 01:20:42.388
We're here to help you
finish this, Sean.

01:20:44.557 --> 01:20:46.592
There's something
I gotta do first.

01:21:02.208 --> 01:21:03.273
[door buzzes, clicks]

01:21:03.275 --> 01:21:05.209
Thanks.

01:21:05.211 --> 01:21:07.344
Wow.
[laughing]

01:21:07.346 --> 01:21:09.382
A cat fall on your head?

01:21:11.951 --> 01:21:14.218
- Did you bring the sugar?
- No, I didn't bring you sugar.

01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:16.153
I just came here
for one thing.

01:21:16.155 --> 01:21:18.190
You're so mean.

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.495
I'm sorry about
your Uncle Brian.

01:21:23.497 --> 01:21:26.698
- I read what they wrote about him in OFI.
- Yeah.

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:28.365
He seemed like
he was very nice.

01:21:28.367 --> 01:21:30.404
I just met him once.

01:21:31.505 --> 01:21:34.171
So, what's your one thing?

01:21:34.173 --> 01:21:36.608
The two arson pros
that came to see you,

01:21:36.610 --> 01:21:38.276
who were they workin' for?

01:21:38.278 --> 01:21:40.245
Which foreign
intelligence agency

01:21:40.247 --> 01:21:42.247
were they gonna sell
that package to?

01:21:42.249 --> 01:21:44.549
Russians? Chinese?

01:21:44.551 --> 01:21:46.317
Really?

01:21:46.319 --> 01:21:48.453
Wow.

01:21:48.455 --> 01:21:50.488
They didn't say anything
about that to me.

01:21:50.490 --> 01:21:52.524
Okay, well,
what did they want?

01:21:52.526 --> 01:21:54.292
What did...

01:21:54.294 --> 01:21:58.263
They just wanted what
all would-be dragon tamers want.

01:21:58.265 --> 01:22:01.433
They wanted an opportunity
to sit with the man they know

01:22:01.435 --> 01:22:04.137
knows how to converse
with the dragon.

01:22:05.672 --> 01:22:08.206
Hang on. Did you help them
with the Lincoln Park fire?

01:22:08.208 --> 01:22:11.409
Sean, no! No!

01:22:11.411 --> 01:22:13.511
I-I have a reputation.

01:22:13.513 --> 01:22:16.548
I just talked to them
about the dragon.

01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:22.287
Okay, so how were they gonna ship
their package out of the country?

01:22:22.289 --> 01:22:24.523
Package?

01:22:24.525 --> 01:22:26.792
Why-Why would they
talk to me about that?

01:22:26.794 --> 01:22:30.195
Because the language of
these people is fire, right?

01:22:30.197 --> 01:22:33.734
Oh. They don't speak
the language of fire.

01:22:35.035 --> 01:22:36.569
Not like we do.

01:22:36.571 --> 01:22:38.471
Yeah, you and I don't speak
the same language.

01:22:38.473 --> 01:22:42.575
Oh, come on, Sean.
Of course we do.

01:22:42.577 --> 01:22:45.578
You love to speak with the dragon.
So do I.

01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:49.350
And the dragon loves to speak with
us, and you know it.

01:22:50.418 --> 01:22:53.488
And poor Rimgale.
That's all he ever wanted.

01:22:54.522 --> 01:22:57.356
But the dragon
wouldn't dance for him.

01:22:57.358 --> 01:22:59.325
It's true.

01:22:59.327 --> 01:23:01.694
Just you and me, Sean.

01:23:01.696 --> 01:23:06.467
When your Uncle Brian and
Rimgale came to see me in here...

01:23:07.468 --> 01:23:10.271
they came to interview
the... the devil.

01:23:12.507 --> 01:23:17.343
You knew that if you were ever
going to come in here to see me,

01:23:17.345 --> 01:23:21.280
you knew it was your alter ego
that you'd be seeing.

01:23:21.282 --> 01:23:25.353
You would be seeing...
another you.

01:23:26.688 --> 01:23:29.458
Hi, another me.

01:23:30.391 --> 01:23:32.391
All right, look,
just level with me.

01:23:32.393 --> 01:23:34.394
How are they gettin'
the package out of Chicago?

01:23:34.396 --> 01:23:38.600
I don't know anything about a package.
Nothing. Okay?

01:23:40.402 --> 01:23:42.702
But I will share
a story with you,

01:23:42.704 --> 01:23:44.538
if you will share
a story with me.

01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:46.773
Goddamn it.
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.

01:23:46.775 --> 01:23:48.642
This isn't a conversation,
okay?

01:23:48.644 --> 01:23:51.444
[chuckling]

01:23:51.446 --> 01:23:53.547
[blowing]

01:23:53.549 --> 01:23:56.251
All right.
What story?

01:23:57.452 --> 01:24:01.755
Two guys walk into a building,
one walks out.

01:24:01.757 --> 01:24:03.323
You know what?
Fuck you.

01:24:03.325 --> 01:24:05.659
I told you at the hospital

01:24:05.661 --> 01:24:09.563
that I still had
one more question to ask.

01:24:09.565 --> 01:24:12.399
The answer that you give

01:24:12.401 --> 01:24:15.504
could be very cleansing
for you, Sean.

01:24:18.675 --> 01:24:22.309
He'd already lit his burn in the
church on West Haddon Street.

01:24:22.311 --> 01:24:26.381
Yeah. I imagine it must have
been very beautiful.

01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:30.085
It was over-thought.

01:24:31.754 --> 01:24:35.388
Lot of show,
but you could tell by its yammering

01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:39.560
that it was unstable enough to knock
out with the right counter fire.

01:24:39.562 --> 01:24:43.333
So, I grabbed a gardener's
can of mixed fuel...

01:24:44.434 --> 01:24:46.667
and I splashed
a response.

01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:48.569
Just a little.

01:24:48.571 --> 01:24:51.706
But enough that both fires
turned on each other,

01:24:51.708 --> 01:24:54.842
away from the building,
and ate each other's tails.

01:24:54.844 --> 01:24:56.713
Poof. Done.

01:24:58.715 --> 01:25:01.851
And yet Wicek
was still consumed.

01:25:04.354 --> 01:25:06.122
Yeah. He was.

01:25:06.789 --> 01:25:08.591
So here's my question.

01:25:09.726 --> 01:25:11.694
What did you feel...

01:25:12.729 --> 01:25:14.597
when Wicek caught fire?

01:25:16.199 --> 01:25:17.901
Did you want him to burn?

01:25:19.535 --> 01:25:21.805
Did you want to burn them all?

01:25:25.643 --> 01:25:28.476
You have no idea.

01:25:28.478 --> 01:25:30.748
Oh. Oh, believe me.

01:25:32.415 --> 01:25:34.384
I do.

01:25:34.985 --> 01:25:38.756
I do. I do, Sean.

01:25:41.992 --> 01:25:45.494
Those two men
with the pretend names,

01:25:45.496 --> 01:25:49.767
they wanted my opinion
of their notion...

01:25:51.435 --> 01:25:55.671
as to how they could best
trigger an "accidental" fire

01:25:55.673 --> 01:25:57.906
at an exterior location.

01:25:57.908 --> 01:25:59.843
Okay. What location?

01:26:03.014 --> 01:26:06.917
Given the Kelvin required
for ignition was minimal,

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:12.189
given the constraint
of mixed fuel,

01:26:13.024 --> 01:26:15.860
given the narrow diameter
piping,

01:26:17.261 --> 01:26:18.930
given all of that...

01:26:20.698 --> 01:26:24.401
I would suggest that you
go looking for a location...

01:26:25.436 --> 01:26:27.970
with lots and lots of...

01:26:27.972 --> 01:26:30.474
- propane.
- Propane.
