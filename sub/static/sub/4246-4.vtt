intelligence committee

looked into

00:22.441 --> 00:24.275
by the ethics committee,
and to my thinking,

00:24.342 --> 00:26.544
it's because I was reckless
enough to talk to you,

00:26.611 --> 00:29.246

is making me toss and turn,

01:18.794 --> 01:20.027

in another bed

staying up late in bed

01:24.666 --> 01:26.099

and Democratic and free,

01:26.167 --> 01:27.834

my pretty little head

01:27.902 --> 01:29.235

to spend my nights

who gets erections in his sleep

- Next week.
- Can't you leave sooner?

01:46.085 --> 01:46.986
- No.
- Why not?

01:46.987 --> 01:48.555
Because I can't leave
the country I run

01:48.622 --> 01:51.658

want to look at my face.

02:09.508 --> 02:10.708
You ever been to a rat lab?

02:11.376 --> 02:13.010
It's basically rats

02:13.078 --> 02:14.444

with sweetener,

02:17.481 --> 02:19.348

02:19.416 --> 02:21.150

That was the last time.

02:47.877 --> 02:49.443
Yeah, I think you said
that the last time

02:49.512 --> 02:50.445
and the time before that.

02:50.513 --> 02:53.648
Also times four through six, but
oddly not the seventh time...

02:53.716 --> 02:55.417
- Ohh. - So I really should
remember what I did there.

02:55.485 --> 02:57.819

it involved pillows.

07:16.963 --> 07:19.064
What did Jenny do Saturday
before she disappeared?

07:19.131 --> 07:20.732
Checked herself
into rehab, I hope.

07:20.799 --> 07:23.200
Checked all the fancy ones.
No dice.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.035
Oh, thank God!

07:25.103 --> 07:26.804
(Quinn) I think I
might have found her.

07:26.872 --> 07:28.373
A girl. There's a girl...

07:28.440 --> 07:30.207
Unconscious in a hospital
near Newport, Rhode Island.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.843
Matches Jenny's description.

07:32.110 --> 07:33.310
And you think she's okay?
(Cell phone ringing)

07:33.346 --> 07:34.712
Alcohol poisoning,
but she's stable.

07:34.780 --> 07:36.080
The hospital's faxing me a
photo go identify her. (Beeps)

07:36.147 --> 07:38.616
(Lowered voice) Hey.

07:38.684 --> 07:40.818
Thanks, Bill.
I'll be right there.

07:40.886 --> 07:43.020
(Speaking inaudibly)

07:44.990 --> 07:47.492
(Man) Be careful, ma'am.
(Olivia) Thanks.

07:47.559 --> 07:49.927
(Indistinct police radio chatter)

07:52.497 --> 07:54.631
(Sighs)

07:55.499 --> 07:57.733
(Fax machine receiving tone sounding)
Here it is. It's coming through.

07:57.801 --> 07:59.935
(Tone continues)

08:00.003 --> 08:01.604
(Whirring)

08:03.139 --> 08:04.240
(Olivia sighs)

08:06.000 --> 08:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here

08:13.116 --> 08:15.217
(Projector and camera shutter click)

08:15.284 --> 08:19.154
She's got an ankle bracelet
with a cross on it.

08:25.627 --> 08:26.828
(Projector and camera shutter click)

08:26.895 --> 08:29.496
(Whirs)

08:29.564 --> 08:31.365
That's not our daughter.

08:31.433 --> 08:32.466
That's not...

08:32.534 --> 08:33.500
Jenny.

08:36.205 --> 08:37.839
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

08:37.905 --> 08:39.207
(Crying)

08:39.274 --> 08:40.941
(Sighs)

08:42.744 --> 08:44.644
That's Jenny Nystrom.

08:53.858 --> 08:55.358
(Projector and camera shutter click)

08:55.359 --> 08:56.393
(Olivia) Where are we?

08:56.460 --> 08:57.260
(Abby) No phone at the scene.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.095
(Harrison) It's a long shot to think

08:58.096 --> 08:59.829
whoever killed her
wouldn't have tossed it.

08:59.897 --> 09:01.098
Yeah, but not having it
makes figuring out

09:01.165 --> 09:02.731
where she was that night
a little more difficult.

09:02.899 --> 09:04.266
She was at the state department

09:04.333 --> 09:05.533
at a party called
"around the world."

09:05.601 --> 09:06.867
She was gonna write
about it in her blog.

09:06.868 --> 09:07.736
(Olivia) How do you know?

09:07.737 --> 09:09.637
She would upload her blog
entries to a remote server

09:09.705 --> 09:10.706
before posting them.

09:10.773 --> 09:12.707
I reset the password. Got access
to her files this morning.

09:12.708 --> 09:13.441
(Quinn) Around the world?

09:13.509 --> 09:14.242
(Harrison)
It's a benefit banquet

09:14.310 --> 09:15.477
all the embassies send
their staffers to.

09:15.544 --> 09:16.878
Prime hunting ground
for party girls.

09:17.346 --> 09:18.413
How is a 19-year-old
on the guest list

09:18.481 --> 09:19.846
for a state department party?

09:19.914 --> 09:21.281
If you're young and hot
and men like talking to you,

09:21.349 --> 09:22.449
you're on the list.

09:22.517 --> 09:23.550
Abby, make some calls.

09:23.618 --> 09:24.685
Find out who Jenny
talked to at the party,

09:24.752 --> 09:26.220
if she was seen going
home with anyone.

09:26.288 --> 09:29.023
Quinn, Harrison,
follow up on the autopsy.

09:29.190 --> 09:30.991
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

09:31.059 --> 09:32.193
Tell me what happened.

09:32.260 --> 09:33.493
She was filming a P.S.A.

09:33.561 --> 09:34.661
In the east room
with some school children.

09:35.229 --> 09:36.261
The one about
eating your vegetables?

09:36.330 --> 09:37.396
The one about
getting vaccinated.

09:37.464 --> 09:39.231
And then what, Canada invaded?

09:39.299 --> 09:40.700
Is that why I was dragged
out of my meeting

09:40.767 --> 09:42.267
with the joint chiefs of staff?

09:42.336 --> 09:44.970
Did the children die of mumps
before they were able to finish?

09:45.038 --> 09:46.872
Actually, it's worse than that.

09:46.940 --> 09:49.608
He puked on me...

09:49.676 --> 09:51.076
That filthy little runt

09:51.144 --> 09:52.344
with the eye patch
under his glasses.

09:52.411 --> 09:54.679
Top of my class at Harvard,
top of my class at Yale law,

09:54.747 --> 09:56.781
and this is what
I've been reduced to?

09:57.850 --> 09:59.183
(Door closes)
(Cyrus) You summoned?

09:59.251 --> 10:00.919
(Mellie) This was a $600 skirt.

10:00.986 --> 10:03.455
Stop scrubbing me!
It's ruined.

10:05.524 --> 10:08.492
Thank you for your help.
I will be fine from here.

10:08.560 --> 10:11.628
Thank you.

10:11.696 --> 10:13.897
(Door opens and closes)

10:13.965 --> 10:15.298
I want something done.

10:15.367 --> 10:17.401
I'm not sure what you...

10:17.469 --> 10:19.202
Excuse me, sir,
is there a reason

10:19.270 --> 10:20.637
that you're here and not
in the oval working?

10:20.705 --> 10:22.172
A child puked on my pregnant wife.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.507
I've rushed to her side
to comfort and care for her.

10:24.575 --> 10:25.742
I'm pretending I give a damn.

10:25.809 --> 10:27.343
I can't work with this.

10:27.411 --> 10:29.812
I am holding the sticky hands
of children who pick their noses

10:29.880 --> 10:32.382
and telling their idiot
parents to do their job

10:32.449 --> 10:33.816
and immunize their kids.

10:33.884 --> 10:36.018
How stupid do you have to be
not to immunize your kid?

10:36.086 --> 10:37.353
Isn't it just natural selection

10:37.421 --> 10:38.688
if your unimmunized,
snot-nosed brat

10:38.756 --> 10:40.889
gets smallpox
in the 21st century?

10:40.956 --> 10:43.958
And I have to smile
and get <i>puked</i> on?

10:44.026 --> 10:45.226
This is my platform?!

10:45.294 --> 10:46.961
This is what I'm supposed
to do all day?!

10:47.029 --> 10:48.330
It's part of the job description.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.565
I want a seat at the table.

10:50.232 --> 10:51.366
You have a seat at the table.

10:51.434 --> 10:52.668
The kiddie table.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.869
I want to be at the adults' table

10:54.937 --> 10:56.570
like I was during the election.

10:56.638 --> 10:59.373
- Mellie... - Or have you forgotten
how things worked back then?

11:02.143 --> 11:05.446
We've all made sacrifices,
me as much as anyone.

11:05.514 --> 11:07.047
That was the election.
This is the White House.

11:07.115 --> 11:10.318
And in the White House, <i>this</i>
is the way things work.

11:10.385 --> 11:11.951
(Exhales)
(Door opens and closes)

11:12.019 --> 11:14.053
I'd say 20 minutes
is long enough

11:14.121 --> 11:15.221
to fake worry about you.

11:15.289 --> 11:17.324
I want to be <i>heard.</i>

11:17.391 --> 11:18.858
Like Cyrus said,
we've all made sacrifices.

11:18.926 --> 11:21.661
I know I have,
but I suck it up!

11:21.729 --> 11:22.995
I suggest you do the same.

11:23.063 --> 11:24.197
(Gasping)

11:24.264 --> 11:25.098
(Door closes)

11:25.166 --> 11:26.599
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

11:27.267 --> 11:28.767
Check that out.
Windshield.

11:28.935 --> 11:30.469
We also have some contusions
and rib fractures

11:30.537 --> 11:31.870
from the safety restraints.

11:31.938 --> 11:33.139
That's what gave her
the internal injuries.

11:33.206 --> 11:34.607
So you're saying she
died in a car crash?

11:34.774 --> 11:36.208
Ah, soil samples
from the scene...

11:36.276 --> 11:37.743
(Taps keys) Match soil
samples from her lungs,

11:37.810 --> 11:39.611
which means they were still
breathing when they dumped her.

11:39.679 --> 11:41.247
- So she was...
- Alive. Totally.

11:41.414 --> 11:43.615
Crazy part? Her internal lacs
really weren't all that bad.

11:43.682 --> 11:45.049
She ends up in a hospital
instead of a ditch,

11:45.117 --> 11:46.151
she probably
would've been okay.

11:47.119 --> 11:48.686
(Olivia) <i>Alive?</i>

11:48.754 --> 11:51.022
Are you telling me Jenny was
on her face in a ditch

11:51.089 --> 11:52.622
suffocating on dirt and
slowly bleeding out

11:52.690 --> 11:53.691
for five hours?

11:53.759 --> 11:54.692
Any leads at all?

11:54.760 --> 11:55.860
She was definitely at the
state department party.

11:55.928 --> 11:57.095
Still don't know
who she left with.

11:57.163 --> 11:58.296
I got a guest list.

11:58.364 --> 11:59.363
The glass they pulled
out of Jenny's skull

11:59.431 --> 12:00.630
was from a 458 spider.

12:00.698 --> 12:01.865
Okay, cross-reference
the make and model

12:01.933 --> 12:02.999
with the state department
guest list.

12:03.068 --> 12:04.168
It's a start.

12:04.235 --> 12:05.302
Are you coming back
to the office?

12:05.370 --> 12:07.604
- We could use your help.
- Soon. I'll be there soon.

12:07.672 --> 12:08.772
(Line disconnects)

12:08.839 --> 12:12.542
(Dial tone)

12:16.046 --> 12:18.080
Hi.
Can you tell me,

12:18.147 --> 12:20.416
has an Olivia Pope checked
in for her chemo yet?

12:20.417 --> 12:22.085
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

12:22.453 --> 12:24.454
(Verna) Olivia.

12:24.456 --> 12:27.357
I thought I said
no visitors. (Coughs)

12:28.224 --> 12:30.159
Actually,
that was <i>my</i> rule,

12:30.226 --> 12:33.194
but only because you hired me
to keep your condition secret.

12:33.261 --> 12:34.996
As your friend, however,

12:35.064 --> 12:36.898
I think you need
all the support you can get.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.133
Yes, and as
a supreme court justice,

12:39.201 --> 12:41.302
I know that as soon
as I go public,

12:41.369 --> 12:44.072
I'll have half the country
rooting for my demise.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.607
While the other half
prays for your recovery.

12:45.774 --> 12:47.708
Don't you have somewhere
you have to be?

12:47.775 --> 12:50.143
No. I have some time.

12:50.211 --> 12:51.544
I'm serious.

12:51.612 --> 12:53.280
Aren't you supposed to be
fixing someone

12:53.347 --> 12:55.048
or saving someone right now?

12:55.116 --> 12:57.550
Why isn't that phone of
yours ringing or buzzing

12:57.618 --> 13:00.387
- or dinging or whatever it is
blueberries do? - I turned it off.

13:00.455 --> 13:02.623
You've learned nothing
from me over the years.

13:03.090 --> 13:05.257
- What is the one thing...
- Never turn off my phone.

13:05.258 --> 13:07.326
Exactly.
Then why the hell is...

13:07.327 --> 13:09.162
Verna, you're getting chemo.

13:09.930 --> 13:11.497
My phone is off.

13:15.669 --> 13:18.537
(Monitor continues
beeping rhythmically)

13:18.605 --> 13:21.572
(Inhales deeply) I must be
dying faster than I thought.

13:23.908 --> 13:26.744
There are nine 458 spiders
in the D.C. area

13:26.811 --> 13:27.845
registered to these owners.

13:27.846 --> 13:28.514
(Abby) All men, it turns out,

13:28.581 --> 13:30.614
because women don't have
embarrassingly small sex organs

13:30.682 --> 13:31.950
they need to compensate for.

13:32.017 --> 13:33.051
Read us the names
and we'll check them

13:33.052 --> 13:34.118
against the state
department's guest list.

13:34.186 --> 13:35.353
Yuri Grechko.

13:35.421 --> 13:36.487
Grechko. No.

13:36.555 --> 13:37.688
Brian Turner.

13:37.756 --> 13:38.289
No.

13:38.357 --> 13:39.490
- Yashiro Kyoto.
- Mnh-mnh.

13:39.558 --> 13:40.992
- Philip Lemley.
- Mnh-mnh.

13:41.060 --> 13:44.094
Sebastian Overby.
Alexander Lavich. Kenneth Morse.

13:44.095 --> 13:45.663
Wait.
Lavich.

13:45.664 --> 13:48.066
- Alexander Lavich. He on the list?
- Mm-hmm.

13:48.133 --> 13:49.500
Call the police.
I'll call Liv.

13:52.035 --> 13:53.102
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

13:53.170 --> 13:55.004
They bring Lavich in
for questioning yet?

13:55.072 --> 13:56.505
He's there now, and get this...

13:56.573 --> 13:58.007
The night our girl goes missing,

13:58.075 --> 14:00.442
Alexander Lavich drives
his car into a tree.

14:00.510 --> 14:01.944
He tells police he's the
only one in the car,

14:02.012 --> 14:03.079
but the site of the accident?

14:03.147 --> 14:04.446
Less than 50 yards
from the ditch

14:04.514 --> 14:06.949
they found her body in.
Liv, this is our guy.

14:07.017 --> 14:09.284
I'll tell the Nystroms they can
stop holding their breath.

14:09.351 --> 14:11.320
Hang up. Now.

14:11.988 --> 14:13.254
What's the matter with you?

14:13.322 --> 14:14.122
I've been trying to reach you.

14:14.190 --> 14:16.257
Your cell was off.
We have a problem.

14:16.325 --> 14:17.226
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)
Alexander Lavich...

14:17.294 --> 14:20.028
41, cultural attache
at the Kurkistani embassy.

14:20.097 --> 14:21.663
And with diplomatic immunity,
virtually untouchable.

14:21.731 --> 14:22.965
We can't challenge it,
his immunity?

14:23.032 --> 14:24.599
I don't know, go to a judge,
get it revoked?

14:24.666 --> 14:26.667
The Vienna Convention on
diplomatic relations mandates

14:26.735 --> 14:28.470
that all diplomatic agents
have full immunity

14:28.537 --> 14:30.037
from the jurisdiction
of the local courts,

14:30.106 --> 14:31.573
which means they can't
arrest him, they can't try him.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.141
He can't even be held
or questioned.

14:33.209 --> 14:35.176
The only way we get him is if
Kurkistan revokes his immunity,

14:35.244 --> 14:36.578
and the only way
they do that...

14:37.145 --> 14:39.246
Is if the president of
the United States makes them.

14:39.314 --> 14:40.579
- Where are you going?
- Out.

14:40.616 --> 14:42.283
Are you gonna keep
your cell on this time?

14:48.022 --> 14:50.023
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

14:50.090 --> 14:51.091
(Cyrus) You can't be here.

14:51.092 --> 14:52.559
I wouldn't have come
if I didn't need a favor.

14:52.627 --> 14:54.961
You want Fitz to call
the Prime Minister of Kurkistan

14:55.029 --> 14:56.696
- and ask to waive Lavich's
diplomatic immunity. - Yes.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.198
No. Politically
impossible right now.

14:59.265 --> 15:00.166
I can't go into why, but...

15:00.167 --> 15:01.667
You need access
to Kurkistan's airspace

15:01.668 --> 15:03.203
in case you want
to attack east Sudan.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.440
(Sighs) I just left a meeting
with three staffers

15:08.508 --> 15:10.876
who think Kurkistan
is next to Morocco.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.710
God, I miss you.
Also, you can't be here.

15:12.778 --> 15:14.446
A young girl
was brutally left to die...

15:14.514 --> 15:16.748
Yes, dead girl, violence,
murder, people are bad...

15:16.815 --> 15:17.715
I'm feeling emotions.

15:17.783 --> 15:20.285
The only reason I allowed you
through those White House gates

15:20.353 --> 15:21.786
is because he's on the hill right now.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.555
You can't be here.
He's not doing well.

15:23.822 --> 15:25.290
He's struggling,
he's suffering,

15:25.358 --> 15:26.759
and seeing you
will make it worse.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.525
I've gotta keep his mind
in the G8, so you have to go

15:28.593 --> 15:30.061
before he comes...
(Door opens)

15:32.131 --> 15:33.231
(Sighs deeply) (Door closes)

15:33.298 --> 15:36.033
Before he comes back
and sees you.

15:38.837 --> 15:40.738
I could be running Harvard
right now.

15:40.806 --> 15:43.141
I had the job.
I turned it down.

15:46.878 --> 15:48.545
Mr. President...

15:54.152 --> 15:55.585
I'm here about Jenny Nystrom.

15:55.653 --> 15:57.253
What happened to Jenny
Nystrom is a tragedy,

15:57.321 --> 15:58.822
and my heart goes out
to her family,

15:58.890 --> 16:01.390
but we are not asking Kurkistan
to waive diplomatic immunity.

16:01.457 --> 16:03.625
We can't, and you know we
can't because you're smart

16:03.694 --> 16:05.427
and because you used to work here.

16:05.495 --> 16:07.730
So I'm not sure why you came
to the White House.

16:07.798 --> 16:09.799
Did you show up here
to awaken my conscience,

16:09.866 --> 16:11.901
make me see
the error of my ways?

16:11.968 --> 16:13.836
'Cause I'm awake.

16:13.904 --> 16:16.238
I see the errors, thank you.

16:25.748 --> 16:28.416
(Bag rustles)

16:28.483 --> 16:31.119
(Door opens)

16:31.187 --> 16:32.220
(Door closes)

16:40.301 --> 16:41.468
<i>(Man) Over here!</i>

16:41.535 --> 16:42.869
<i>How long were you seeing</i>
<i>the girl?</i>

16:42.937 --> 16:43.637
<i>(Woman) Did you know</i>
<i>she was still alive</i>

16:43.704 --> 16:44.905
<i>when you left the scene?</i>

16:44.973 --> 16:45.939
<i>(Man) Are you gonna issue</i>
<i>a statement?</i>

16:46.007 --> 16:48.741
<i>You want a statement?</i>
<i>Here's my statement.</i>

16:49.509 --> 16:51.243
(Click) You got the man
elected, for God sakes.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.978
He is the President of this
country because of you.

16:54.045 --> 16:55.913
- He owes you.
- There are strategic considerations.

16:55.981 --> 16:56.915
Oh, please, Olivia.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.817
A 19-year-old girl is dead,
and we know who killed her.

16:58.885 --> 17:01.286
There's your
strategic consideration.

17:02.053 --> 17:03.153
I'll make
an appointment with him.

17:03.221 --> 17:04.221
I'll tell him
I'm ready to support

17:04.289 --> 17:06.089
his weak-kneed solar policy.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.525
Edison,
you're being investigated

17:07.593 --> 17:09.792
by the ethics committee
for discussing intel with me.

17:09.859 --> 17:11.828
They're not gonna let you
past the guard gate.

17:11.896 --> 17:13.030
The president
has de-friended you.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.499
Now is not the time for you

17:14.567 --> 17:17.569
to be the public face
of this or anything else.

17:21.005 --> 17:23.339
A couple of grieving parents,
on the other hand...

17:23.407 --> 17:24.508
(James brown)
♪ can't pass the people ♪

17:24.576 --> 17:27.978
♪ can't pass the, hit me ♪

17:27.979 --> 17:29.546
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

17:29.614 --> 17:32.416
(People speaking indistinctly)

17:33.684 --> 17:35.150
Peter Nystrom says
he's not going anywhere

17:35.219 --> 17:36.352
until the President
gets involved

17:36.420 --> 17:38.153
and insists that
the Embassy of Kurkistan

17:38.222 --> 17:39.488
waive Alexander Lavich's
immunity...

17:39.556 --> 17:40.855
The embassy is adamant
that Mr. Lavich's immunity

17:40.923 --> 17:42.657
protects him from any
further investigations,

17:42.725 --> 17:43.725
and they're not wrong.
According to the rules...

17:43.792 --> 17:44.559
Now it's just a game of chicken.

17:44.627 --> 17:46.361
Look, I feel like
a jerk out here

17:46.429 --> 17:47.630
waving my arms
at the White House

17:47.697 --> 17:49.064
like a crazy person,

17:49.132 --> 17:50.999
trying to get
the President's attention.

17:51.167 --> 17:52.700
Heck, I even voted for the guy.

17:52.768 --> 17:55.937
But I'm here because
Jenny deserves justice,

17:56.004 --> 17:57.771
and I've run out of options.

17:57.839 --> 17:58.772
(Shouting questions at once)

17:58.940 --> 18:00.174
Our forward bases will receive

18:00.242 --> 18:01.342
daily fuel shipments
out of Kurkistan

18:01.410 --> 18:02.376
provided they don't get skittish,

18:02.444 --> 18:03.977
which we can't afford.

18:04.246 --> 18:06.347
In the event we're forced
to engage with east Sudan,

18:06.414 --> 18:08.782
we'd like to avoid putting
the boots on the ground.

18:08.850 --> 18:10.618
If, however, the initial
battery of air strikes

18:10.685 --> 18:12.419
isn't enough to make...
(Speaks indistinctly)

18:12.487 --> 18:14.654
We do have the 172nd drilling

18:14.722 --> 18:16.456
for the possibility...
(Continues indistinctly)

18:16.523 --> 18:17.924
<i>Jenny is innocent.</i>

18:17.992 --> 18:20.127
<i>She was a good kid</i>
<i>and a good daughter,</i>

18:20.194 --> 18:22.495
<i>and... I think if I can</i>

18:22.563 --> 18:26.032
<i>just talk to the President</i>
<i>father to father,</i>

18:26.100 --> 18:29.135
<i>i just hope he would understand</i>
<i>and try to help.</i>

18:29.202 --> 18:31.103
<i>(Sighs) That's it.</i>

18:31.171 --> 18:31.671
<i>Thank you.</i>

18:31.739 --> 18:34.073
It's smart. It's brilliant.
The optics, the staging...

18:34.141 --> 18:36.408
She's taking my playbook
and throwing it in our faces.

18:36.476 --> 18:38.110
She has the moral
high ground here, Cy.

18:38.178 --> 18:39.644
An American girl was murdered,

18:39.712 --> 18:40.879
and those parents
deserve justice.

18:40.947 --> 18:41.514
The better half of me

18:41.582 --> 18:43.115
wants to toss that son
of a bitch in prison,

18:43.183 --> 18:44.183
immunity be damned.

18:44.185 --> 18:44.851
Sir...

18:44.918 --> 18:46.385
The political half of me
knows I can't.

18:46.452 --> 18:48.020
Keep your pants on.

18:48.088 --> 18:49.721
(Protesters chanting)
We want justice!

18:49.790 --> 18:51.590
We want justice!

18:52.358 --> 18:53.725
(Man) Day three of the
Peter Nystrom vigil,

18:53.793 --> 18:55.126
and still no response
from the White House.

18:55.194 --> 18:56.962
But growing support
from Americans

18:57.029 --> 18:58.763
who are pitching their
tents in solidarity,

18:58.831 --> 19:00.266
turning this now
into a major standoff

19:00.333 --> 19:01.032
<i>where on one hand you've got</i>

19:01.100 --> 19:02.434
<i>the President</i>
<i>of the United States</i>

19:02.502 --> 19:04.035
<i>digging his heels in</i>
<i>over foreign policy</i>

19:04.103 --> 19:05.936
<i>and on the other, you've got</i>
<i>an innocent young woman</i>

19:06.004 --> 19:06.805
<i>who the American people</i>

19:06.872 --> 19:09.340
<i>desperately want him</i>
<i>to fight for.</i>

19:09.808 --> 19:11.942
(Protesters chanting) We want justice!
We want justice!

19:12.010 --> 19:14.745
(Shouting and chanting indistinctly)

19:19.750 --> 19:21.117
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

19:21.185 --> 19:22.952
David, I'm not asking for a tour.

19:23.020 --> 19:25.054
I'm just saying,
I have cookies... delicious,

19:25.122 --> 19:27.990
"you'll be my slave forever
once you eat these" cookies.

19:28.058 --> 19:30.793
And if you're home tonight,
I can...

19:30.861 --> 19:32.495
You have plans tonight.
Right.

19:32.563 --> 19:35.231
By "plans," you mean peeling
the skin off your latest victim.

19:35.298 --> 19:37.600
No. I get it.
Forget I asked.

19:37.667 --> 19:38.834
(Cell phone beeps)

19:38.901 --> 19:40.669
(Huck) There artificial
sweetener in that?

19:40.737 --> 19:42.904
(Sighs)
People and their secrets.

19:42.972 --> 19:44.607
Between this one and Olivia,

19:44.674 --> 19:46.709
it's like we're living
in the Soviet union.

19:46.776 --> 19:48.310
Hell, I'm an open book.

19:48.378 --> 19:50.811
What about you, Huck?
What's your secret?

19:50.879 --> 19:53.948
Artificial sweetener
makes rats spit up blood.

19:54.015 --> 19:54.550
That's not true.

19:54.617 --> 19:56.318
There are whole studies
that say that's not true.

19:58.387 --> 20:00.388
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

20:04.560 --> 20:05.225
(Inhales sharply)

20:05.493 --> 20:08.395
Every call made to and from
Quinn's ex-boyfriend

20:08.463 --> 20:10.096
in the three weeks
leading up to the explosion.

20:10.164 --> 20:12.065
Wow.
And several pieces of popcorn.

20:12.132 --> 20:14.401
Uh, Jane got a popper. I think
she's trying to bond with me.

20:14.569 --> 20:16.570
(Inhales sharply) So how's
it going with the ginge?

20:16.637 --> 20:18.439
Abby.
Her name is Abby.

20:18.506 --> 20:20.640
She seen your apartment yet?
Did she see that wall?

20:20.708 --> 20:21.175
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

20:21.209 --> 20:23.710
(Doorknob rattling)

20:27.915 --> 20:29.783
(Knocks)

20:31.150 --> 20:33.018
Oh, steamy out there, right?

20:33.086 --> 20:34.720
I'm schvitzing.

20:37.423 --> 20:38.723
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

20:38.791 --> 20:41.059
O.M.G. You like her.

20:41.127 --> 20:42.360
Oh, will you...

20:42.828 --> 20:44.261
I am simply using her
for information.

20:44.329 --> 20:45.897
Uh, no, you're using me
for information.

20:45.965 --> 20:47.431
You're using her to get laid,

20:47.500 --> 20:49.200
and you totally like her.

20:49.267 --> 20:51.369
Word to the wise, 007,
if you really like her,

20:51.437 --> 20:52.904
do not let her see that wall.

20:52.972 --> 20:54.538
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

21:14.226 --> 21:16.226
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

21:24.143 --> 21:25.443
Manzani's pizza,

21:25.512 --> 21:27.778
Manzani's pizza,
Manzani's pizza,

21:27.846 --> 21:29.046
ooh, T.J.'s Fried Chicken.

21:29.114 --> 21:30.247
Oh, yay.
Special occasion.

21:30.315 --> 21:31.448
You're gonna want to
skip to page eight.

21:31.517 --> 21:32.984
That's where things
get interesting.

21:35.988 --> 21:37.722
A D.C. area code.

21:37.789 --> 21:40.657
That Quinn's ex-boyfriend
Jesse called 11 times

21:40.725 --> 21:41.992
the week before he died.

21:45.028 --> 21:46.830
David Rosen.

21:46.897 --> 21:49.199
Glad to finally meet you.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.135
I always keep an eye
out for legal talent.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.637
A man in my position can't
have too many lawyers,

21:53.704 --> 21:55.205
unfortunately.
(Chuckles) No offense.

21:55.273 --> 21:56.373
None taken.

21:56.741 --> 21:58.974
Sit.
So what can I do you for?

21:59.042 --> 22:01.944
Well, I wanted to ask
about Cytron,

22:02.011 --> 22:04.012
a small software
company in California.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.115
Sorry, my friend.
Name doesn't ring any...

22:06.182 --> 22:08.751
Wait. That the company
that young girl blew up?

22:08.818 --> 22:10.620
Case the government
screwed the pooch on?

22:11.087 --> 22:12.721
Now that was a slam dunk right there.

22:12.789 --> 22:14.056
Whoever lost that thing

22:14.124 --> 22:16.824
is about as a sharp
as a sack of wet mice.

22:16.892 --> 22:18.126
- That wasn't your case?
- Afraid so.

22:18.393 --> 22:19.527
- Ouch.
- In any event,

22:19.595 --> 22:21.629
according to phone
records, Jesse Tyler,

22:21.697 --> 22:23.598
one of the young men who was
killed in the explosion,

22:23.666 --> 22:26.267
made 11 calls to your company
in the week before he died.

22:26.335 --> 22:27.936
You need to speak to
my I.T. boys about that.

22:28.003 --> 22:30.304
Heck, they nerd-talk
all over the world...

22:30.372 --> 22:31.672
India, Hong Kong, Malaysia.

22:31.739 --> 22:33.173
These weren't calls
to your I.T. department.

22:33.241 --> 22:34.575
Well, they weren't calls to me.

22:34.642 --> 22:36.577
I don't know about
that software stuff.

22:36.644 --> 22:38.178
My grandkids can't even teach
me how to use my telephone.

22:38.246 --> 22:40.013
Well, actually, they were calls
to your head of security,

22:40.081 --> 22:41.648
which is confusing,

22:41.716 --> 22:43.884
because Doyle energy doesn't
have a contract with Cytron.

22:44.051 --> 22:45.185
Never has.

22:45.252 --> 22:48.020
Now that <i>is</i> a mystery.

22:48.388 --> 22:51.056
So would it be possible to talk
with your security head?

22:51.124 --> 22:52.624
Absolutely.

22:52.692 --> 22:53.958
Just come back with a
warrant or subpoena

22:54.026 --> 22:55.394
or whatever it is you boys over at

22:55.462 --> 22:56.695
the U.S. attorneys
office normally get,

22:56.763 --> 22:58.563
and then all those lawyers
of mine I was talking about...

22:58.631 --> 23:00.265
They can advise you on
what they'd need to see.

23:00.333 --> 23:02.501
I hoped he and I might
speak more informally.

23:02.568 --> 23:04.436
Well, now he wouldn't be
much of a security head

23:04.504 --> 23:06.739
if he didn't keep things secure.

23:11.877 --> 23:13.644
Thanks for your time.

23:13.812 --> 23:15.514
Pleasure.

23:16.982 --> 23:19.550
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

23:19.618 --> 23:21.118
You know, you really
don't have to stay.

23:21.185 --> 23:22.686
I'm good.

23:22.754 --> 23:24.988
Liv, you don't have time
for this. I watch the news.

23:25.055 --> 23:26.856
You're going for broke
in Lafayette square.

23:26.924 --> 23:28.424
You're poking a bear.
With that protest

23:28.492 --> 23:29.826
across the street
from the White House...

23:29.894 --> 23:31.661
- You're poking a bear.
- I'm doing what I have to do

23:31.729 --> 23:33.295
to get Alexander Lavich's
immunity waived.

23:33.363 --> 23:36.332
You try so hard to get that
man to walk away from you.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.967
Have you ever
stopped to consider

23:38.035 --> 23:40.403
how painful it's gonna be
if you succeed,

23:40.470 --> 23:42.137
if he actually does walk away?

23:42.204 --> 23:44.205
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

23:44.273 --> 23:45.641
We worked on the general
election together,

23:45.708 --> 23:47.275
and I'm not stupid.

23:47.343 --> 23:50.111
And we've been through far too
much together to pretend.

23:50.179 --> 23:50.847
And you're pushing him away

23:50.914 --> 23:52.815
because you think
it's the right thing to do,

23:52.883 --> 23:54.650
as if right and wrong
are fixed.

23:54.718 --> 23:56.885
And if you succeed
in pushing him away...

23:56.953 --> 24:00.755
Liv, I've seen
you two together.

24:00.823 --> 24:02.792
You breathe in sync.

24:05.060 --> 24:07.995
You have a very
active imagination.

24:08.063 --> 24:09.096
You are poking a bear.

24:09.164 --> 24:10.197
Please stop.

24:10.266 --> 24:13.400
Please.

24:14.268 --> 24:16.336
Well, at least turn your
phone back on. (Beep)

24:16.404 --> 24:17.738
Verna, I really don't think
that we...

24:17.805 --> 24:19.906
(Cell phone alert chimes)

24:19.974 --> 24:22.342
(Chime) The White House.

24:22.410 --> 24:24.244
(Chime) I see why you
turned your phone off,

24:24.312 --> 24:27.414
to keep my active
imagination in check.

24:27.482 --> 24:28.748
(Chime)

24:28.815 --> 24:30.048
(Beep)

24:30.116 --> 24:31.417
Hi.

24:31.485 --> 24:33.185
Hello, Olivia.

24:35.021 --> 24:36.088
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

24:36.156 --> 24:38.091
Let's talk about us,
you and me.

24:38.159 --> 24:39.358
Mellie, I certainly
don't want to...

24:39.426 --> 24:41.360
If we lived in Kurkistan,

24:41.428 --> 24:43.029
we would've been married
off at the age of 12

24:43.097 --> 24:44.963
to pay a debt
or buy some livestock

24:45.031 --> 24:46.398
or to feed the mennonough

24:46.465 --> 24:48.033
to keep growing opium
in the fields.

24:48.101 --> 24:49.634
And after our weddings,
our husbands would beat us

24:49.702 --> 24:51.203
and rape us and force us
to bear their children

24:51.271 --> 24:53.505
before we were done
being children ourselves.

24:54.172 --> 24:56.340
And we wouldn't vote or
drive or have voices

24:56.409 --> 24:57.876
or rights of any kind.

24:57.943 --> 24:59.277
I wouldn't want that
for my daughter

24:59.344 --> 25:00.778
or myself...

25:00.845 --> 25:02.145
Or you.

25:02.213 --> 25:04.515
So when some
self-important goat herder

25:04.582 --> 25:06.217
from that crappy
little wasteland

25:06.285 --> 25:08.452
thinks he can come here to
the United States of America

25:08.520 --> 25:10.187
and treat one of our bright,
young, college-educated women

25:10.255 --> 25:13.389
with less dignity than a dog
run down on a country road,

25:13.457 --> 25:14.458
I take exception.

25:15.326 --> 25:16.659
What do you want, Mellie?

25:16.727 --> 25:19.062
Your story, that protest...
It's starting to die.

25:19.130 --> 25:20.563
The crowds get smaller
every day,

25:20.631 --> 25:22.833
and my husband's administration
is refusing to engage.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.134
It would be a great help to you

25:24.202 --> 25:25.668
if the first lady
of the United States

25:25.736 --> 25:27.304
took a stand on this, wouldn't it?

25:38.994 --> 25:40.194
Why am I here, Liv,

25:40.262 --> 25:41.628
at a protest that
I've already covered?

25:41.696 --> 25:43.230
Because I told you
it would be worth it,

25:43.298 --> 25:45.332
and if I say it's going
to be worth it, it's worth it,

25:45.400 --> 25:46.867
so turn on your camera,
stop complaining,

25:46.935 --> 25:48.536
- and decide how you're gonna thank me.
- Olivia...

25:48.603 --> 25:51.272
Camera on.

25:51.739 --> 25:54.608
(Indistinct conversations)

25:59.713 --> 26:01.848
(Camera shutters clicking)

26:01.915 --> 26:03.716
Mr. and Mrs. Nystrom,

26:03.784 --> 26:07.286
I just want to say
how sorry I am for your loss.

26:07.354 --> 26:07.921
I have two children,

26:07.989 --> 26:09.289
and as you can see,
I'm about to have a third,

26:09.356 --> 26:10.891
and I just can't imagine

26:10.958 --> 26:13.025
the pain you must be
going through right now.

26:13.093 --> 26:16.162
Would you mind
if I joined you for a bit?

26:17.330 --> 26:18.530
(Reporters shouting at once)
No, no.

26:18.598 --> 26:20.032
No questions at this time.

26:20.100 --> 26:21.800
I'm not here
in any official capacity.

26:21.868 --> 26:23.302
I'm not here as first lady.

26:23.370 --> 26:25.237
I'm here as a mom,

26:25.305 --> 26:27.906
a mom who is horrified
that our legal system

26:27.974 --> 26:29.540
has fallen woefully short

26:29.608 --> 26:32.009
in getting justice
for Jenny Nystrom.

26:32.010 --> 26:34.612
(Man) Mrs. Grant, why isn't
the White House doing more?

26:46.056 --> 26:47.590
The woman's a political genius.

26:47.658 --> 26:49.626
- Which one?
- Huh?

26:49.693 --> 26:51.227
Mellie or Liv?

26:51.294 --> 26:54.797
Both.
They both are.

26:54.865 --> 26:58.067
(Laughing)

27:01.303 --> 27:03.672
Mr. President...

27:03.740 --> 27:06.742
(Continues laughing)

27:09.546 --> 27:11.880
Mr. President.

27:11.948 --> 27:15.517
(Continues laughing)
I'm sorry. Sorry.

27:15.585 --> 27:16.784
(Inhales deeply)

27:16.852 --> 27:18.185
I'm the leader
of the free world,

27:18.253 --> 27:20.154
I'm arguably the most powerful
man on the planet,

27:20.221 --> 27:21.989
and I am being brought
to my knees

27:22.057 --> 27:25.092
by my wife and my...

27:25.160 --> 27:26.861
And Olivia Pope.

27:26.929 --> 27:28.196
This is a political nightmare.

27:28.264 --> 27:30.130
Jenny Nystrom has become
more important

27:30.198 --> 27:31.566
than the entire nation
of east Sudan

27:31.633 --> 27:33.000
thanks to Liv and Mellie.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.602
They worked together.

27:35.670 --> 27:37.771
I...

27:37.838 --> 27:40.240
(Scoffs)

27:40.308 --> 27:44.178
They <i>worked together.</i>

27:44.245 --> 27:45.612
The women in your life

27:45.680 --> 27:48.615
play a very mean game
of political chess.

27:50.650 --> 27:54.620
Game over.
They win.

27:54.688 --> 27:56.055
(Sighs)

27:58.192 --> 28:00.293
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

28:03.730 --> 28:05.564
(Tvs playing inaudibly)

28:18.110 --> 28:19.511
(Sighs) How long's
she been doing that?

28:19.578 --> 28:21.078
A long time.

28:21.146 --> 28:22.913
Always in circles or is she
varying the pattern?

28:22.980 --> 28:23.582
Circles.

28:26.050 --> 28:29.119
If she would talk to someone,
let someone in once in a while,

28:29.187 --> 28:30.387
maybe she wouldn't wear out

28:30.455 --> 28:32.222
so many pairs
of expensive shoes.

28:32.290 --> 28:35.192
The hell with it.
I'm going in.

28:42.132 --> 28:45.601
Any word from the White House?

28:45.669 --> 28:47.603
(Sighs)

28:49.072 --> 28:51.141
Okay, I deserve to know things.

28:51.208 --> 28:53.175
Since that trial,
everything has been a secret.

28:53.243 --> 28:54.509
Everything has been
a one-way street,

28:54.577 --> 28:56.412
and if you would just...
What is going on?

28:56.479 --> 28:58.547
Who are you protecting?
What does Quinn have on you

28:58.615 --> 29:00.282
that makes you so determined
to put yourself at risk?

29:00.350 --> 29:01.217
Don't worry about it.

29:01.284 --> 29:03.452
Don't worry about it?
It's all I do.

29:03.519 --> 29:05.187
I worry about it
because you won't talk to me,

29:05.255 --> 29:06.755
you won't tell me anything.

29:06.823 --> 29:08.023
The trial's been over
for weeks.

29:08.091 --> 29:09.423
Everyone's moved on.

29:09.491 --> 29:11.059
I'm done suggesting
you do the same.

29:11.126 --> 29:14.462
I now <i>require</i> it.
<i>Move on.</i>

29:15.898 --> 29:18.566
(Cell phone alert chimes)

29:18.633 --> 29:20.068
(Chime)

29:20.135 --> 29:22.670
I need to take this privately.

29:22.738 --> 29:24.839
Of course you do.

29:31.712 --> 29:33.513
Cyrus.

29:33.581 --> 29:35.515
15 minutes.
Our old place.

29:35.883 --> 29:37.617
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

29:37.685 --> 29:39.819
(Indistinct conversations)

29:39.887 --> 29:41.953
Hi. Reservation for two.
Cyrus Beene.

29:42.021 --> 29:44.056
You're the first to arrive.
This way.

29:44.123 --> 29:46.559
(Indistinct conversations continue)

29:46.626 --> 29:48.260
Thank you.

29:48.328 --> 29:49.361
Can I get you
something to drink?

29:49.429 --> 29:51.430
Just some water.

29:51.498 --> 29:54.833
(Indistinct conversations
continue)

29:54.901 --> 29:55.901
(Sighs)

30:04.510 --> 30:07.378
(Indistinct conversations stop)

30:16.521 --> 30:19.389
(Footsteps approaching)

30:26.897 --> 30:28.398
(Chair scrapes floor)

30:32.969 --> 30:34.437
(Chair scrapes floor)

30:34.804 --> 30:37.573
The United States is declaring
Lavich persona non grata

30:37.641 --> 30:38.707
and deporting him.

30:38.775 --> 30:40.043
So Lavich is forced
out of the U.S.

30:40.110 --> 30:41.577
And has to return home
to Kurkistan,

30:41.645 --> 30:43.212
where he'll,
I don't know, chill

30:43.280 --> 30:45.313
for the rest of his life
in a giant palace

30:45.381 --> 30:47.149
while Jenny Nystrom's murder
goes unavenged?

30:47.216 --> 30:48.316
It's the best I can do.

30:48.384 --> 30:49.551
Nice.
Wonderful.

30:49.618 --> 30:51.886
America's the greatest
country in the world.

30:56.725 --> 30:59.193
One of your staffers could've
told me this over the phone.

30:59.194 --> 31:00.261
I wanted to see you.

31:00.263 --> 31:02.063
Why?
What's the point?

31:05.568 --> 31:07.035
I'm going to the G8 tonight.

31:07.102 --> 31:10.136
You want to hitch a ride
on Air Force One?

31:13.340 --> 31:14.374
(Sighs)

31:14.442 --> 31:16.476
Yeah, I didn't think so.

31:18.913 --> 31:21.247
(Sighs)

31:21.315 --> 31:24.184
You must really hate me.

31:26.587 --> 31:28.921
For falling in love with you.

31:32.525 --> 31:35.027
I tried.
I made the call.

31:35.095 --> 31:36.929
I asked Kurkistan to withdraw
support for Lavich

31:36.997 --> 31:38.363
so I could have him arrested.

31:38.431 --> 31:39.565
They said no, so I did
the next best...

31:39.633 --> 31:40.599
Can I walk out of here,

31:40.667 --> 31:42.033
or will I be stopped
by Tom and Hal?

31:42.101 --> 31:43.402
Liv.

31:43.469 --> 31:45.103
(Voice breaking)
Where can this go, really?

31:45.171 --> 31:47.438
Other than me joining
the Mile High Club with you

31:47.506 --> 31:50.306
in Air Force One,
how is there any future here?

31:53.680 --> 31:55.180
(Sighs)

32:03.288 --> 32:04.524
Fine.

32:05.891 --> 32:08.092
We're done.

32:10.495 --> 32:11.762
What?

32:13.497 --> 32:15.064
I'm letting you go.

32:16.767 --> 32:18.835
That's what you want, right?

32:22.639 --> 32:26.042
And look, I'll drop
the charges against Edison.

32:26.109 --> 32:27.276
The ethics committee
doesn't need to look at him.

32:27.344 --> 32:29.144
It's fine.

32:29.211 --> 32:32.213
You go your way.
I'll go mine.

32:32.281 --> 32:35.650
I'm married.
I have children.

32:35.717 --> 32:37.718
I can't do this.

32:37.786 --> 32:40.255
It's not fair to you
or to me or to Mellie

32:40.323 --> 32:41.957
or to the country.

32:43.592 --> 32:46.160
I have to be responsible.

32:49.164 --> 32:50.864
Right?

32:56.338 --> 32:59.139
Right.

33:02.209 --> 33:03.542
Okay.

33:03.610 --> 33:05.544
Okay.

33:17.423 --> 33:20.058
Well...

33:22.661 --> 33:25.697
you order whatever you want.

33:27.266 --> 33:29.401
It's all being charged
to me anyway.

33:32.605 --> 33:34.138
(Exhales deeply)

33:43.548 --> 33:46.417
(Crying)

34:04.502 --> 34:06.636
<i>(Man) Mr. President,</i>
<i>do you think you did enough?</i>

34:06.703 --> 34:08.571
<i>(Fitz) I think...</i>

34:09.839 --> 34:11.472
<i>I think I did</i>
<i>what I had to do</i>

34:11.540 --> 34:13.340
<i>in the face of complicated</i>
<i>foreign policy.</i>

34:13.407 --> 34:15.141
<i>Our options were limited.</i>

34:15.210 --> 34:17.077
<i>Did I want to do more?</i>
<i>Did I try to do more?</i>

34:17.145 --> 34:19.780
<i>Of course.</i>

34:19.848 --> 34:22.815
<i>I hope the Nystrom family</i>
<i>as well as the American people</i>

34:22.884 --> 34:24.451
<i>will not consider this</i>
<i>a defeat,</i>

34:24.518 --> 34:25.953
<i>because it's not.</i>

34:26.020 --> 34:27.387
<i>Despite the circumstances,</i>

34:27.455 --> 34:29.321
<i>despite</i>
<i>the insurmountable obstacles,</i>

34:29.389 --> 34:30.591
<i>we tried.</i>

34:30.958 --> 34:34.659
<i>And now it's important to know</i>
<i>when to move on.</i>

34:34.728 --> 34:37.563
<i>So that's what we're doing.</i>

34:37.630 --> 34:40.399
<i>We're moving on.</i>

34:40.467 --> 34:41.734
(Clicks)

34:41.802 --> 34:44.203
(Peter) He's giving in.
He's caving.

34:44.271 --> 34:45.904
(Olivia) Peter, the President
has done everything he...

34:45.972 --> 34:49.641
I don't give a damn about
international law or treaties!

34:49.708 --> 34:50.976
They're nonsense!

34:51.043 --> 34:52.510
They mean nothing!

34:52.578 --> 34:55.313
That man killed our daughter!

35:00.819 --> 35:02.253
Where are you going now?

35:02.320 --> 35:03.387
What?

35:03.454 --> 35:04.688
Where are you going?

35:04.756 --> 35:06.123
The hotel.
Back to the hotel.

35:06.191 --> 35:08.092
(Zips up jacket) Don't do it.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.095
Excuse me...

35:09.161 --> 35:11.361
Wherever you are going after
you drop your wife at the hotel,

35:11.363 --> 35:13.164
the hardware store,
the gun shop,

35:13.231 --> 35:14.631
the safe in the
back of your closet...

35:14.699 --> 35:15.900
Don't go there.

35:15.967 --> 35:17.300
Don't do it.
It's not worth it.

35:17.367 --> 35:18.868
He's not worth it.
It will feel good

35:18.936 --> 35:20.503
for a few seconds,

35:20.570 --> 35:23.706
but then it will eat at you
for the rest of your life.

35:23.774 --> 35:26.176
Let me ask you, you got kids?

35:26.243 --> 35:27.643
- No, sir.
- Yeah.

35:27.711 --> 35:29.179
I didn't think so.

35:44.560 --> 35:47.529
(Footsteps approach)

35:49.531 --> 35:51.966
You did good work
for those people.

35:52.034 --> 35:52.934
(Scoffs)

35:53.001 --> 35:54.601
You did good work.

35:54.669 --> 35:57.771
Hard to feel like it,
but you did.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.974
These girls...

36:00.042 --> 36:02.143
They come here thinking they're
going to change the world,

36:02.211 --> 36:03.978
and then they get involved
with some man,

36:04.046 --> 36:06.546
and everything just...

36:06.613 --> 36:09.382
I thought we were
very good together.

36:11.085 --> 36:13.119
You weren't talking about me.

36:13.187 --> 36:14.855
(Chuckles)

36:14.922 --> 36:16.689
Which is awkward.
(Chuckles)

36:19.160 --> 36:22.127
We <i>were</i> good together.

36:26.632 --> 36:28.800
Come here.

36:28.869 --> 36:30.836
Come here.

36:37.476 --> 36:40.678
Everything's gonna be all right.

36:45.117 --> 36:47.151
No, it's not.

36:55.260 --> 36:57.727
Why is Abby the only one
who ever questions Olivia?

36:57.795 --> 36:59.496
(Glass clatters)
Mm. Come again?

36:59.563 --> 37:01.064
Look...

37:01.132 --> 37:02.866
Look, I'm trying here.
Okay? I am.

37:02.934 --> 37:04.501
I am trying to be
a team player.

37:04.568 --> 37:06.303
I'm trying to be
just another associate

37:06.371 --> 37:07.737
at Pope and Associates,

37:07.805 --> 37:10.373
but every time I look
at Olivia, I think,

37:10.440 --> 37:12.474
this woman saved my life,

37:12.542 --> 37:14.444
and she won't tell me how
and she won't tell me why.

37:14.512 --> 37:16.445
And I know she's done things
for all of us,

37:16.513 --> 37:18.047
fixed all of us.

37:18.115 --> 37:19.681
But no one asks her
any questions.

37:19.749 --> 37:22.018
We all just do
<i>whatever</i> she says,

37:22.085 --> 37:23.786
and... doesn't that ever
bother you?

37:25.254 --> 37:28.156
You know what I think about
when I look at Olivia?

37:28.224 --> 37:31.293
My bookkeeping degree.

37:31.360 --> 37:33.295
- What?
- That's what you do, right,

37:33.362 --> 37:34.629
when you're spending eight
years in federal prison?

37:34.696 --> 37:36.197
That's what I was facing
for insider trading.

37:36.265 --> 37:38.066
Eight years of my life...
(Imitates shooting sound)

37:38.134 --> 37:40.568
Wasted if she hadn't saved me.

37:40.636 --> 37:42.904
So the way I see it,
Liv's a good person,

37:42.971 --> 37:44.672
and if a good person
has to do something bad

37:44.740 --> 37:47.675
for the right reasons,
I'm down... with... that.

37:47.743 --> 37:50.144
So I don't know the hows
I don't want to know the whys.

37:50.211 --> 37:52.680
I just come to work every
day thankful as all hell

37:52.748 --> 37:56.216
I didn't have to earn
a bookkeeping degree.

37:59.086 --> 38:00.286
Hmm?

38:03.524 --> 38:05.460
Mmm.

38:05.461 --> 38:07.795
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

38:09.531 --> 38:13.032
<i>(Tv playing indistinctly)</i>

38:13.100 --> 38:18.171
I don't understand why
you have to get gas tonight.

38:18.839 --> 38:20.773
It'll save us time
in the morning.

38:20.841 --> 38:23.943
<i>(Woman) ...Embroiled in</i>
<i>a scandal this week involving</i>

38:24.011 --> 38:26.312
<i>the death of a Baines University</i>
<i>sophomore...</i> - Oh, my God!

38:26.380 --> 38:28.781
<i>was found unconscious</i>
<i>in a Washington, D.C. home...</i>

38:28.849 --> 38:30.315
(Volume increases)
<i>Police were called to the scene</i>

38:30.383 --> 38:31.984
<i>where Lavich</i>
<i>was pronounced dead,</i>

38:32.051 --> 38:35.087
<i>the victim of what appears</i>
<i>to be a freak heart attack.</i>

38:35.154 --> 38:37.122
(Huck) Earlier tonight I went out.

38:37.190 --> 38:40.725
I went out hard,
drank a lot of whiskey.

38:40.793 --> 38:42.961
I wish I could say
I didn't enjoy it,

38:43.029 --> 38:44.863
that I felt sick to my stomach,

38:44.931 --> 38:46.264
that I couldn't even

38:46.331 --> 38:47.899
look at myself
in the mirror afterwards,

38:47.966 --> 38:49.233
but I can't say that,

38:49.301 --> 38:50.668
because it was...

38:50.736 --> 38:53.971
It was perfect.

38:54.239 --> 38:57.741
And that kind of perfection
doesn't make me feel weak,

38:57.809 --> 38:58.810
it makes me feel strong.

38:59.077 --> 39:00.477
(Exhales)

39:00.545 --> 39:02.345
I looked at myself
in the mirror,

39:02.413 --> 39:05.849
and I finally recognized
that person I once knew so well,

39:05.917 --> 39:09.419
that person who went out
all the time,

39:09.486 --> 39:13.389
sometimes just for fun.

39:13.457 --> 39:17.360
And now that I've seen
that person again,

39:17.428 --> 39:19.595
I don't know
if I could ever go back.

39:40.049 --> 39:42.917
(Camera shutters clicking,
reporters shouting at once)

39:44.753 --> 39:45.920
(Man) Mr. President!

39:45.988 --> 39:48.056
(Camera shutters
continue clicking)

39:48.123 --> 39:49.623
You gonna miss me?

39:49.691 --> 39:51.892
That was an asinine thing
you did today.

39:51.961 --> 39:53.561
Worked out well for me
this time,

39:53.628 --> 39:55.096
but the next time
you cross me...

39:55.164 --> 39:56.430
Careful. You don't want
to threaten me.

39:56.497 --> 39:58.332
'Cause I might actually
get angry.

39:58.399 --> 40:00.133
Now say good-bye
to our child.

40:00.201 --> 40:01.568
You never miss a beat, do you?

40:01.635 --> 40:03.670
(Chuckles)

40:03.737 --> 40:07.341
(Reporters continue shouting at once)

40:08.108 --> 40:09.341
Good luck in Tokyo!

40:09.409 --> 40:10.777
I love you!

40:10.844 --> 40:14.880
(Shouting continues)

40:17.083 --> 40:19.918
(Humming)

40:24.523 --> 40:26.958
- Holy... what the hell?
- Relax.

40:27.026 --> 40:28.894
I already saw your wall
when I broke in earlier.

40:28.961 --> 40:30.428
What are you...
You can't just break in...

40:30.496 --> 40:31.563
You... what are you...
What the hell?

40:31.630 --> 40:34.965
Is this something,
you and me? Is it?

40:35.033 --> 40:37.302
Are you just having fun?
Is this just sex?

40:37.369 --> 40:40.771
Or is this real?
Or... is this something?

40:40.839 --> 40:42.473
(Sighs)

40:42.541 --> 40:44.542
This is something.

40:44.610 --> 40:46.276
Then we should talk

40:46.377 --> 40:48.545
about what's going on
with Olivia Pope.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.454
I've been focused
on Quinn Perkins.

40:57.522 --> 40:59.189
I've been focused on
Olivia Pope.

40:59.257 --> 41:02.091
I've been wrong.

41:02.158 --> 41:04.360
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

41:08.098 --> 41:10.399
(David) They know things.
They're involved, sure.

41:10.467 --> 41:12.335
But the murder
of those seven people

41:12.402 --> 41:13.536
at Cytron software...
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

41:13.604 --> 41:16.004
It's bigger than them...
Much bigger.

41:22.345 --> 41:23.845
'Cause why is Jesse Tyler,

41:23.912 --> 41:26.248
Quinn Perkins'
dead ex-boyfriend,

41:26.315 --> 41:28.583
calling an oil tycoon in D. C...
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

41:28.651 --> 41:30.685
11 times the week
he's blown to bits?

41:30.753 --> 41:32.254
Maybe they were old friends.

41:32.321 --> 41:33.587
Maybe he's related to the guy.

41:33.655 --> 41:35.389
One of the grant
administration's biggest donors?

41:35.457 --> 41:37.224
Wake up and smell
the cover-up, Abby.

41:37.292 --> 41:38.292
This is a conspiracy.

41:38.360 --> 41:40.161
Who knows how high up it goes?

41:40.229 --> 41:43.630
Sure do you appreciate you
making the time, friends.

41:48.103 --> 41:50.003
So what do you think?

41:50.104 --> 41:52.072
I think Oswald acted alone.

41:52.139 --> 41:54.007
I think 9/11 was just
a terrorist attack,

41:54.108 --> 41:55.508
and I think AIDS is a crappy disease,

41:55.576 --> 41:57.443
not a biological weapon
created by the Pentagon.

41:57.544 --> 42:01.781
I think "conspiracy"
is a strong word.

42:09.856 --> 42:11.323
(sighs)

42:11.391 --> 42:13.525
I hear we have
a David Rosen issue.

42:13.593 --> 42:15.861
That we do, Livie.
That we do.

42:21.434 --> 42:24.269
(Helicopter whirring)

42:38.917 --> 42:40.284

42:46.958 --> 42:47.958
