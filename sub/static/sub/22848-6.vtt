WEBVTT

00:07.257 --> 00:12.262
I saw this photo from before
he transferred here, and he just...

00:12.345 --> 00:14.389
-All right, everybody.
-Oh, my God!

00:14.472 --> 00:16.683
Everybody, please.

00:16.766 --> 00:18.518
Relax, calm down.

00:19.185 --> 00:22.397
Grace, since you're on your phone,
you must be prepared

00:22.480 --> 00:24.190
to explain where we left off
the other day.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.901
-Catch me up if you... if you don't mind.
-[Grace] Sure, Mr. Pope.

00:26.985 --> 00:32.490
Um... yesterday, we left off with what
we would have done in Nazi Germany.

00:32.574 --> 00:34.325
Would we have stood up to the fascists

00:34.409 --> 00:37.370
or would we have followed them
and joined them?

00:37.454 --> 00:40.081
That's right.
That is what we were talking about. Um...

00:40.832 --> 00:42.500
Have you come up
with any thoughts on that?

00:42.584 --> 00:44.294
What would you have done?
Any ideas?

00:44.377 --> 00:48.840
I like to think that I would have stood up
to the fascists

00:48.923 --> 00:50.592
and gone against them.

00:50.675 --> 00:52.343
But I know that was really scary...

00:53.011 --> 00:55.972
'cause they were turning kids
against their parents

00:56.056 --> 01:00.268
and putting people in concentration camps
and killing people.

01:00.351 --> 01:04.314
So I wanna believe
that I would have done that,

01:04.397 --> 01:07.025
but I don't actually know.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.319
[Pope] Right.
Yeah, and it's more than that.

01:09.402 --> 01:12.113
It's impossible to know
what it would have felt like at the time.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.908
In hindsight, we can all say,
"I would've said something.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.701
It would have been obvious.
It would have been easy."

01:16.785 --> 01:19.245
But we're about to look at the example
of one particular family

01:19.329 --> 01:22.040
who wasn't able
to see what was right or wrong.

01:22.123 --> 01:24.584
They were going along
with what the mentality of the time was.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.712
-[school bell rings]
-[chattering]

01:28.922 --> 01:31.674
-Your place?
-Yeah, my place, of course.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.219
-Hi, guys.
-Guys, we're gonna do homework.

01:34.302 --> 01:35.512
-We're going.
-[girl] Do homework?

01:35.595 --> 01:36.596
-Homework?
-Yeah.

01:36.679 --> 01:38.097
-[boy] Text us.
-Shut up. We're doing homework.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.767
-Okay, bye!
-Thank you! Thank you!

01:48.066 --> 01:50.527
-Diet Coke?
-Sure.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.162
-What?
-I need to know when your parents--

02:01.246 --> 02:04.874
-Oh, my God. Again? Seriously?
-I just... I was just checking.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.293
-You're always freaking out!
-I'm not...

02:07.377 --> 02:09.879
-[laughs] I'm not freaking out.
-There's no one here.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.257
-There's never anyone here.
-I'm not freaking out.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.592
Oh, my God. Look... [chuckles]

02:15.802 --> 02:18.138
my mom won't be home for another hour.

02:18.721 --> 02:21.558
And my dad never gets home till,
like, ten.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.268
-Forever. Forever.
-Forever.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.019
[chuckles] He's never home.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.106
[grunts]

02:32.485 --> 02:35.446
-[Jake moaning] Yes.
-[sighs]

02:35.530 --> 02:37.198
[Jake and Grace chattering]

02:40.618 --> 02:42.078
[Grace] Okay.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.294
[moaning and kissing]

02:51.087 --> 02:52.297
[chuckling]

02:53.631 --> 02:56.134
Grace? Are you in there? Oh, gee!

02:58.011 --> 02:59.679
-[Dad] Cover up.
-Yeah.

02:59.762 --> 03:01.723
-You've got ten seconds.
-Dad!

03:01.806 --> 03:03.766
[Jake] My pants were on, sir.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.269
-Eight, nine...
-[Grace] Dad!

03:12.734 --> 03:14.944
I'm sick one day and this happens.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.323
What about the days I'm not sick?
What else is she doing?

03:18.406 --> 03:21.367
Our heads have been in our asses.
I feel bad.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.077
I think we thought we were on easy street.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.371
Like,
"She's almost finished the school year."

03:25.455 --> 03:28.291
"Then she's gonna go to college.
It'll be great."

03:28.374 --> 03:32.086
"She's not doing drugs and having sex
when we're not here."

03:32.170 --> 03:33.379
Her grades are good.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.465
Are we sure?

03:36.049 --> 03:37.842
I haven't been on that website in a while.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.552
-Have you?
-Forgot my password.

03:40.678 --> 03:42.764
-You should go talk to her.
-I'm gonna go talk to her.

03:42.847 --> 03:45.892
Okay. There will be wine waiting for you.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.101
-There better be.
-[chuckles]

03:47.185 --> 03:49.187
[door rattles]

03:50.647 --> 03:52.190
-[knock on door]
-[sighs]

04:05.620 --> 04:07.580
[Grace exhales]

04:12.335 --> 04:16.714
First of all, I'd like to separate
what happened today

04:16.798 --> 04:19.759
-into two categories, okay?
-Okay.

04:19.842 --> 04:20.677
One...

04:21.844 --> 04:23.888
I don't want you to feel bad
about being sexually active.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.140
I feel really strongly about that.

04:26.224 --> 04:27.517
You're not in trouble for that.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.768
We'll talk about that another time,

04:28.851 --> 04:32.480
because I am very angry
about the second thing,

04:32.563 --> 04:37.026
which is that you basically lied to us
and that's unacceptable, Grace.

04:37.110 --> 04:41.990
There's no reason for it.
You don't have hardly any rules.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.701
I can really only think of the one rule,

04:44.784 --> 04:48.121
which is don't have friends over
after school without asking us first.

04:48.204 --> 04:50.623
Maybe the other rule is don't lie to us,

04:50.707 --> 04:52.917
but I didn't think that even needed
to be a rule, okay?

04:53.001 --> 04:55.586
Yeah, but I only lied to you because--

04:55.670 --> 04:59.966
I know, but now I am willing
to treat you like an adult.

05:00.049 --> 05:04.345
I don't feel like punishing you
like you're some kind of child anymore.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.098
I don't wanna take away your cell phone
or credit card or ground you.

05:07.181 --> 05:09.976
I don't even know what that means
for a senior in high school.

05:10.059 --> 05:12.186
But one thing I am gonna ask you to do,

05:12.270 --> 05:14.772
and I think you know what I mean
when I say "ask,"

05:15.356 --> 05:18.318
is I want you to come to church
with your dad and I

05:19.110 --> 05:21.529
every Sunday until you leave for college.

05:21.612 --> 05:22.947
And that is--

05:23.031 --> 05:24.282
What?

05:24.365 --> 05:25.783
It's non-negotiable.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.494
That's what I'll ask you to do,
and I'm being very fair.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.497
-I think your father's being very fair.
-I-- [sighs]

05:33.583 --> 05:36.586
-I don't believe in that, so I...
-I know that.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.839
...don't see the point of me going
to church with you.

05:39.922 --> 05:43.384
The point is I asked you to do something,
and I want you to do it.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.387
-Every Sunday? Until college?
-Every Sunday.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.474
Minus the one when we're going
on vacation, but, yes, every Sunday.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.936
I mean, I don't have a say, do I?

05:55.730 --> 05:56.564
No.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.859
Sometimes, there's muffins afterwards.

05:59.942 --> 06:02.070
-[Grace] Yay, muffins.
-It's gonna be great.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.197
-We could get them at the store.
-[laughs]

06:04.280 --> 06:06.741
-But these are really bad muffins.
-Yeah! [chuckles]

06:06.824 --> 06:07.909
So worth it.

06:10.119 --> 06:13.539
Phil, look at you. So good to see you.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.918
-Andy! Hello! Good to see you.
-Good morning, Father, great to see you.

06:17.001 --> 06:19.003
-You remember Grace.
-Grace!

06:19.087 --> 06:21.172
-Hi.
-How lovely to see you again.

06:21.255 --> 06:24.092
-It's been a while.
-Welcome back. Hi, Gretchen.

06:24.175 --> 06:25.301
So good to see you.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.220
-Good to see the family together.
-I know.

06:27.804 --> 06:28.930
[Father Timothy] Hello...

06:29.013 --> 06:31.182
And Jesus said to his disciples,

06:31.724 --> 06:36.562
"Only with difficulty will a rich person
enter the kingdom of heaven.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.650
Again, I tell you,
it is easier for a camel

06:40.733 --> 06:43.569
to go through the eye of a needle

06:43.653 --> 06:46.864
than for a rich person
to enter the kingdom of heaven."

06:48.282 --> 06:51.953
When the disciples heard this,
they were greatly astonished, saying,

06:52.495 --> 06:54.664
"Who then can be saved?"

06:54.747 --> 06:56.207
-Here we go.
-Yeah.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.625
-Have a great time.
-I don't wanna go.

06:57.708 --> 06:58.709
Might not be so bad.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.128
[Grace] I don't wanna hang out
with these people.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.755
You said the same thing about Thai food,
and now you love it.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.882
-This isn't Thai food.
-You do love Thai food.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.926
-[Dad] Maybe it is!
-[Grace] It's not Thai food.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.512
-Hi, I'm Stephanie.
-Nice to meet you. I'm Gretchen.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.721
Nice to meet you.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.765
-Andrew. This is Grace.
-Andrew, nice to meet you.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.560
-[Grace] Hi.
-Welcome. Glad you're here.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.395
All right, you all set? Have a great time.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.188
-Okay.
-See you later this afternoon, honey.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.606
-Bye.
-Have fun.

07:20.690 --> 07:21.649
Bye!

07:21.732 --> 07:22.775
-This is for you.
-Thanks.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.361
Help yourself to a snack
or whatever you'd like.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.487
Everyone, this is Grace.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.573
She's new,
so be sure to introduce yourself.

07:28.656 --> 07:32.201
"I tell you, it is easier for a camel
to go through the eye of a needle

07:32.285 --> 07:34.996
than for a rich person
to enter the kingdom of God."

07:35.079 --> 07:36.456
[Stephanie] I'll stop you there.

07:37.039 --> 07:38.958
Uh...

07:39.041 --> 07:40.960
Yeah, so what does this mean?

07:41.043 --> 07:45.256
Does that mean it's impossible
for a rich person to go to heaven?

07:45.339 --> 07:49.469
Did he say "impossible?" I think he said,
like, with great difficulty.

07:49.552 --> 07:53.639
-It's harder.
-But he said it's easier for a camel to...

07:53.723 --> 07:56.184
-I think it's referencing--
-That's impossible.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.895
There was a trade route
on the way to a marketplace.

07:58.978 --> 08:02.482
And there was a narrow pass that you had
to fit through and it was called--

08:02.565 --> 08:03.691
It was like an eye of a needle,

08:03.774 --> 08:08.613
because the camel would have to unload
what it was carrying to go through.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.072
I know there was another interpretation

08:10.156 --> 08:14.744
saying that it's rope through the needle
rather than a camel through a needle.

08:14.827 --> 08:15.661
Yeah.

08:15.745 --> 08:19.415
Which makes more sense to me,
because a rope and thread make...

08:19.499 --> 08:20.458
They're similar.

08:20.541 --> 08:24.504
But it's impossible to put rope through
the eye of a needle as well.

08:24.587 --> 08:28.841
Well, I mean, not actually a rope,
it's just a bunch of small threads.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.510
We could argue that,

08:30.593 --> 08:33.971
"You have to peel away a couple of layers
until it's a smaller thread."

08:34.055 --> 08:36.474
So if we don't get rid of that stuff,

08:36.557 --> 08:40.102
then my parents, for example,
they're not gonna go to heaven, right?

08:41.771 --> 08:46.984
So I'm hearing you may be questioning
your own attachment to your possessions

08:47.068 --> 08:49.028
and to your wealth and--

08:49.111 --> 08:54.033
I mean, we have camping gear in the garage
that we've used once in ten years.

08:54.784 --> 08:58.329
There are homeless people out there
on the street that could use a tent,

08:58.412 --> 09:00.957
but we don't give it away.
We just have it because we have stuff.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.961
And how can they say that they're gonna go
to heaven and they're religious,

09:05.044 --> 09:09.632
that they're Christian if they don't
even practice what Jesus tells us to do?

09:09.715 --> 09:11.884
I think being able to separate them,

09:11.968 --> 09:14.512
it may not always be
in this physical form--

09:14.595 --> 09:18.432
Right, but we can say that we believe
and practice all we want,

09:18.516 --> 09:20.059
but unless we prove it...

09:20.851 --> 09:22.270
then what is the point?

09:23.020 --> 09:24.188
Then we're just hypocrites.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.523
[knock on door]

09:26.107 --> 09:28.442
-Night.
-Good night.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.529
What are you reading?

09:31.612 --> 09:33.322
Oh, just the Bible.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.410
[whistles] Wow. Cool.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.370
Yeah, it's really interesting.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.583
I'm really glad you made me go
to Bible study.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.252
I am so glad to hear that.

09:46.335 --> 09:50.673
Yeah, we had such a good discussion
about the sermon that we had today.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.675
-Yeah.
-About how it's near impossible

09:52.758 --> 09:54.510
-for rich people to go to heaven.
-Right.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.595
Yeah.

09:55.678 --> 10:00.224
That is one of the big quotes
from the Bible that you hear a lot.

10:00.308 --> 10:04.020
Yeah, I mean, Jesus actually said it,
so it's true, it's like...

10:04.103 --> 10:06.981
-Yeah.
-Unless you give away your wealth,

10:07.315 --> 10:09.233
-you're pretty much not going...
-Right.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.903
So, you know,
if we wanna be good Christians,

10:12.987 --> 10:18.242
we need to, I don't know,
change the way we are, I guess.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.828
Yeah, it's definitely a lot
to think about.

10:20.911 --> 10:22.788
-Yeah.
-When you start to really get into it.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.082
Yeah, the discussion was interesting,

10:25.166 --> 10:29.253
'cause everyone in this neighborhood
is rich, pretty much, you know?

10:29.337 --> 10:31.297
Yeah, we're all really lucky.

10:31.380 --> 10:34.467
We're really lucky and selfish, I guess,

10:34.550 --> 10:36.177
'cause we're not giving it
to other people.

10:36.260 --> 10:39.764
-Well, that can be debatable, but--
-No.

10:39.847 --> 10:42.308
I think Jesus made it pretty clear.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.436
-Yeah. It's a lot to study.
-Yeah.

10:45.519 --> 10:48.773
There's lots of interpretations
of the Bible. That's one of 'em.

10:48.856 --> 10:53.110
Yeah, I don't get the interpretations.
It's like, he said it, so it's the truth.

10:53.861 --> 10:56.405
I'm glad you're enjoying it
and reading up on it.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.283
-That's great, honey.
-Yeah. I'm so glad you made me go.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.036
I'm glad you liked it.
I'll see you in the morning.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.538
I'll let you know if I find out
anything else interesting.

11:04.622 --> 11:05.706
I'm sure you will.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.667
-It's a big book.
-I'm sure I will. Good night.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.085
Good night.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.440
Hey. I'd like to talk to the bank manager.

11:33.651 --> 11:37.696
So this is a significant withdrawal
that you wanna make today.

11:37.780 --> 11:38.823
Yeah.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.785
Do you mind if I ask what it's for?

11:42.868 --> 11:44.412
Oh... The church.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.373
-Just the church?
-Yeah.

11:47.456 --> 11:49.750
I want to give it to my local church.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.211
-Wow. It's a big decision.
-Yeah.

11:52.294 --> 11:54.755
-Did you talk to your parents--
-Oh, yeah.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.591
No, they're super supportive,
'cause they're really Christian

11:57.675 --> 12:00.052
and they're the ones
that really wanted me to do it.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.762
-Okay.
-Yeah.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.222
Well, wonderful.

12:03.305 --> 12:06.892
-You just have to fill out this form.
-Yeah. Cool.

12:06.976 --> 12:12.148
-And it's 48,000...
-600...

12:12.982 --> 12:14.567
...and 14.

12:14.650 --> 12:15.818
Okay, cool.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.321
-So you've thought about this?
-Oh, yeah.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.575
I'm 100% certain.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.035
And my parents are gonna be
so proud of me.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.621
[Dad] If you're such a big adult

12:27.705 --> 12:29.957
making all these
wonderful adult decisions,

12:30.040 --> 12:32.209
maybe you should go
and live your life somewhere else

12:32.293 --> 12:33.836
and get your own goddamn house!

12:33.919 --> 12:36.297
You wanna throw me out of the house
because I wanna help people?

12:36.380 --> 12:38.340
-[Dad] Goodbye.
-Is that what Jesus would want?

12:38.424 --> 12:40.926
-Don't turn this around on us.
-Don't make this about Jesus!

12:41.010 --> 12:43.679
This is about you breaking rules
and not accepting punishment.

12:43.762 --> 12:44.805
You wanted me to find Jesus.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.933
-I found Jesus.
-[Dad] Go find him in your own apartment.

12:48.017 --> 12:52.146
Look, I'm gonna go down to the church
and get the check back, okay?

12:52.229 --> 12:53.647
-We can reset this.
-I already gave it to them.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.524
If you still want to give the money,
you can,

12:55.608 --> 12:58.903
but we're gonna do this together,
as a family,

12:58.986 --> 13:03.199
and maybe we will calm down
and do this like rational human beings.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.075
Can we do that? Can we do that for me?

13:05.159 --> 13:07.119
While you're there,
make sure you talk to the priest

13:07.203 --> 13:09.788
about what being a good Christian means.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.582
You just don't know when to stop.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.125
I'm trying to help you.

13:13.209 --> 13:18.380
No greater gift has been given this church
than Grace's gift.

13:18.464 --> 13:22.134
And she's just--
[sighs] she's found the Lord.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.594
[Dad] So, about that.

13:24.261 --> 13:28.557
I mean, I'm not sure she gave you
the truest representation

13:28.641 --> 13:33.270
of her actual motivations

13:33.354 --> 13:36.023
-at this moment.
-To give from the heart

13:36.398 --> 13:38.943
and forestall college to--

13:39.026 --> 13:40.903
-Yes, but--
-to do what she's doing now.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.614
We do think she is still going to college.

13:43.697 --> 13:47.326
Oh, no. No, she is going to be
doing missionary work.

13:47.409 --> 13:49.328
She would like to go to Africa.

13:49.411 --> 13:52.748
She wants to do missionary work
in Botswana, perhaps Nigeria.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.751
-Isn't that exciting?
-That is exciting.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.837
That would be very exciting. [chuckles]

13:58.921 --> 14:03.759
-If that is what she chooses to do, but--
-She's not spoken with you about this?

14:04.843 --> 14:07.805
Look, we had an issue at home.

14:07.888 --> 14:12.726
And I think she felt
that this would be a way to...

14:12.810 --> 14:15.729
um, uh... make a point.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.940
Do you not want her to do God's work?

14:19.400 --> 14:22.611
-Is this what I'm hearing?
-That's a very hard question

14:22.695 --> 14:24.655
for me to answer at this exact moment,

14:24.738 --> 14:27.867
because of course I do want her
to do God's work,

14:27.950 --> 14:33.622
but she can do it in so many other ways
than giving away all of this money,

14:33.706 --> 14:35.708
which was supposed to help her.

14:35.791 --> 14:39.420
It will help hundreds of people,
as will her work in Africa.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.089
She's not going to Africa.

14:42.172 --> 14:46.635
The girl who was here two hours ago,
she's on a mission.

14:46.719 --> 14:50.055
I will bet you $48,000 she doesn't go
to Botswana.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.979
Is it here? Can I...
I could just take the check.

14:57.646 --> 15:00.524
-I don't--
-It's not your money.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.236
-It's not even my money.
-It kind of is my money.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.905
It's God's money now.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.373
-He wouldn't give the money back.
-[sighs]

15:19.710 --> 15:21.211
Fuck that guy!

15:21.295 --> 15:23.589
It was my money.
I'm allowed to do what I want with it.

15:23.672 --> 15:26.050
-And she's giving it to--
-I was giving it to good people.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.801
And I proved a point, okay?

15:27.885 --> 15:31.889
My parents pretend
to be these great Christians,

15:31.972 --> 15:34.558
but really they're just great capitalists.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.684
-Yeah.
-Seriously.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.688
I am a great capitalist, and my heart
is breaking listening to this.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.149
But you are owning that.
Do you see what I mean?

15:42.232 --> 15:45.194
They are pretending
that they would do this.

15:45.277 --> 15:50.324
They are pretending that they would make
donations and help people, but they don't.

15:50.407 --> 15:53.619
When it actually came to me doing it,
they were pissed.

15:53.702 --> 15:57.081
-I'm pissed. I'm pissed.
-They're such hypocrites, though.

15:57.164 --> 16:00.209
And I hate that,
and I just want to prove that point.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.379
They want me to be more spiritual?
I'll show them what they really are.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.633
[footsteps approaching]

16:08.217 --> 16:10.135
-[Dad] Good morning.
-Morning.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.304
-[Mom] Hi, babe.
-Hey.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.975
When you're done with breakfast,
you'll wanna get dressed,

16:16.058 --> 16:18.268
'cause we gotta leave for the barbecue
in about an hour.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.812
Oh. Um...

16:20.437 --> 16:22.189
I can't go to that.

16:25.150 --> 16:28.404
-How come?
-I said I would volunteer today.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.699
Can you volunteer another day?

16:31.782 --> 16:33.951
'Cause this is supposed
to be a family event.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.536
Um...

16:36.370 --> 16:39.415
-No, I can't.
-Grace, this is a work thing.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.543
-It's been on the calendar for a month.
-You know what, honey?

16:42.626 --> 16:46.588
Andrew, if she wants to--
wants to volunteer, let her volunteer.

16:48.215 --> 16:51.760
-[Dad] It's a family barbecue.
-[Mom] It's fine. Go volunteer.

16:51.844 --> 16:52.845
Thank you.

16:55.931 --> 16:56.932
Okay.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.728
Have fun volunteering.

17:00.811 --> 17:05.024
I will. Thank you.
Have fun at your barbecue.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.191
Can we just not right now?

17:06.275 --> 17:10.529
So basically,
it's a three-part station here.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.573
-Grace.
-Hey.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.784
-Hi. I'm so glad you came.
-Hi. Yeah.

17:15.868 --> 17:16.952
-Hi.
-Hey.

17:18.037 --> 17:22.166
-You know these guys from class.
-I'm Jo. Nice to meet you.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.043
-Maybe you could show her around?
-I'd love to.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.878
Can I steal her for the delivery?

17:25.961 --> 17:27.379
-We're going soon.
-That's perfect.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.839
-You're gonna follow me.
-Sure.

17:28.922 --> 17:29.923
Okay, awesome.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.593
-Thank you for helping today.
-Of course.

17:32.676 --> 17:35.262
-You're in high school?
-Yeah. I'm a senior.

17:35.345 --> 17:36.388
-Oh, nice.
-Yeah.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.473
What are you doing after?

17:37.556 --> 17:40.309
Uh... I'm gonna go to college. I just...

17:40.392 --> 17:42.186
I got into a few schools.
I'm not sure where.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.188
-I'm actually gonna move that.
-Sorry.

17:44.271 --> 17:45.606
I got it. No worries.

17:45.689 --> 17:48.192
So you know Stephanie from the church?

17:48.859 --> 17:50.360
No. I'm not religious.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.571
I don't go to church
or anything like that.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.364
I volunteer here so I know her from there.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.534
That's really cool.
I'm not really religious, either.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.828
My parents just make me go to church.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.580
Well, at least it got you here, right?

18:02.539 --> 18:03.499
Yeah.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.959
What's up, Sylvester? How are you doing?

18:06.043 --> 18:08.003
Throw those down.
We're ready whenever you are.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.089
We're gonna stack 'em there.
Follow my lead.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.216
Once you put 'em down, just go right back.

18:12.299 --> 18:15.969
I'm gonna take the first box.
And you take the second.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.971
Just follow my lead.
Throw them in right here.

18:18.055 --> 18:22.184
It's gonna move fast, so once
you put it down, just get back in line.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.477
Sure.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.656
So you do this all the time?

18:36.949 --> 18:38.450
[man] Yeah. When I can.

18:39.034 --> 18:43.997
It doesn't always work with my schedule,
but it's nice to come here and help out.

18:44.581 --> 18:45.916
Here you go. Have a good one.

18:46.708 --> 18:50.045
So, for some of them,
this is their only meal today?

18:51.130 --> 18:52.339
Yeah, could be.

18:53.966 --> 18:54.800
Oh...

18:57.678 --> 18:58.720
Hi.

19:11.191 --> 19:14.611
-[chuckles] Good job.
-Thanks.

19:22.661 --> 19:23.871
Okay. Come on in.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.083
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.543
Yeah, make yourself at home.

19:29.626 --> 19:32.004
There's the kitchen through there
if you want to eat.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.130
[man] Thanks.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.185
Okay.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.645
Here we go.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.774
I got some stuff here...

19:54.776 --> 19:55.819
for you guys.

19:56.653 --> 20:01.992
Just some tents and sleeping bags,
so take whatever you want.

20:02.075 --> 20:05.746
And I'll go get you guys some clothes,
and you guys can take a shower.

20:05.829 --> 20:08.957
-[man] All right. Nice stuff.
-Okay.

20:24.556 --> 20:28.936
If I have to talk to Belinda one more time
about the carpet

20:29.019 --> 20:30.979
-she chose for the guest room...
-I'm sorry.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.814
I didn't see you over there
for the longest time

20:32.898 --> 20:33.815
or I would have come get you.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.901
I swear to God, every year.

20:35.984 --> 20:40.072
Why doesn't she just change it
if she hates it so much?

20:40.155 --> 20:42.574
She's gone through two decorators,

20:42.658 --> 20:45.786
and I can't tell the difference
between either one,

20:45.869 --> 20:48.538
and she still doesn't have a light fixture
in the entryway.

20:48.622 --> 20:53.210
-[laughs] She's busy with the big picture.
-Edison bulbs are not a light fixture.

20:53.293 --> 20:56.755
I don't care what anyone says.
They're so stupid.

20:56.838 --> 20:59.424
-I don't know that--
-I almost told you--

21:00.217 --> 21:01.051
Hello.

21:01.843 --> 21:04.513
-Hi.
-Hi. Who's this?

21:04.596 --> 21:08.725
Uh, these are some friends that I made
at the food pantry today.

21:08.809 --> 21:12.854
This is James and Dolores and Bob.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.731
-Hello. How are we doing?
-Hi.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.150
-[Bob] Great. Great.
-[James] Lousy.

21:17.234 --> 21:21.697
Uh... you guys volunteer there as well?

21:22.197 --> 21:24.783
-We go there quite often.
-Sort of. Sort of.

21:24.866 --> 21:25.867
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.996
-Oh!
-What do we got here?

21:29.079 --> 21:32.666
Oh! Just... I put some stuff
that we don't really need in there.

21:32.749 --> 21:35.377
Like, food and clothes and camping stuff.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.838
Yeah. We don't need these bags.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.382
-We've had these forever.
-That's a delicious chardonnay.

21:41.508 --> 21:43.635
-[James] It's very tasty. Really.
-[Dolores] Wonderful.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.178
Yeah. Sure.

21:45.262 --> 21:49.850
So if you are done with the car,
I was gonna drop them home to-- where?

21:49.933 --> 21:52.019
-Horner Park.
-Horner Park.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.313
You know what? I got it.
I'll run them back. No worries.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.106
-Yeah, let Dad do it.
-Yeah.

21:56.189 --> 21:58.191
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. Why don't you just let me--

21:58.275 --> 22:00.777
Help me carry this stuff to the car.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.571
Okay. Sure.

22:03.864 --> 22:06.533
-I like your blouse. [chuckles]
-[Dolores] I love the color.

22:06.616 --> 22:10.996
It's beautiful.
Universally flattering, that color pink.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.581
[Bob] Sure is.

22:12.664 --> 22:15.417
-Will you excuse me for one second?
-[James] Sure.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.918
Sure.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.628
All right, Grace, you win.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.756
You don't wanna go to church,
you don't have to go to church.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.466
You're not allowed to go to church.

22:22.549 --> 22:25.177
No more going to church.
No more reading the Bible.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.095
I don't wanna see you with that book again
for a month.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.681
-You can't say she can't go to church.
-Yes, I can. This is too far.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.225
You can't tell her she can't read
the Bible and can't go to church.

22:32.309 --> 22:33.935
Just let me explain, please.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.687
Explain away. Love to hear this.

22:35.771 --> 22:39.858
I get it, okay? The past few weeks,
I have done some stuff.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.651
-Okay. I get it.
-[Dad] Really?

22:41.735 --> 22:43.862
-But that is not what this is about.
-Really?

22:43.945 --> 22:48.700
I went to the food pantry today,
and I met them, and they just needed help.

22:48.784 --> 22:51.787
I know we have clothes here
and camping equipment we don't use

22:51.870 --> 22:54.039
and food we throw away
at the end of the week

22:54.122 --> 22:55.999
so all I wanted to do was help them.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.834
And give them a shower.
What is wrong with that?

22:57.918 --> 22:59.294
-[Mom] I appreciate that.
-That is it.

22:59.377 --> 23:00.879
I think what you're doing is great.

23:00.962 --> 23:04.132
From the kindness of your heart
with no ulterior motive, I'm sure.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.383
-Honey...
-Dad.

23:05.467 --> 23:06.468
You know what's happening as well as I do.

23:06.551 --> 23:07.552
I know what's happened.

23:07.636 --> 23:11.098
-I don't know what's happening.
-That's not what I'm trying to do now.

23:11.181 --> 23:13.100
That's not what I'm trying to do.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.477
I actually genuinely just wanted
to help them.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.937
Okay. Congratulations.

23:17.020 --> 23:19.773
Whatever is happening is working
on me right now, okay?

23:19.856 --> 23:23.735
-Let's take them to their underpass.
-We're talking about this later.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.988
-All right, folks, let's head out.
-Not an underpass.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.741
-Sorry, the park.
-Here we go. You name the... park.

23:31.409 --> 23:34.204
Look, just come back in when...

23:36.415 --> 23:39.334
-[pop music playing]
-[cheering]

23:39.418 --> 23:41.420
[chattering]

23:42.879 --> 23:43.880
Grace!

23:44.965 --> 23:46.800
Oh, my God. Hello.

23:46.883 --> 23:49.761
I know what you did.
I heard. I heard everything.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.012
-You're insane.
-What?

23:51.096 --> 23:53.140
You're dating a crazy person.
Are you aware of this?

23:53.223 --> 23:55.058
[Jake] I didn't say anything.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.351
What is going on?

23:57.227 --> 23:59.229
Do you know what this crazy girl did?

23:59.312 --> 24:02.315
-Hey, what did this crazy girl do?
-What did she do?

24:02.399 --> 24:03.733
Don't be posh.

24:03.817 --> 24:06.903
She brought homeless people into her house

24:07.028 --> 24:09.906
-and gave them her parents' clothes.
-[Jake] I didn't say anything.

24:09.990 --> 24:13.702
-I didn't say anything--
-Taking rebellion to the next level.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.745
-[girl] Why did you do that?
-They're just people.

24:15.829 --> 24:17.581
[girl 2] Do you know them?
What are their names?

24:17.664 --> 24:20.375
-It's James and Dolores and Bob.
-James and Dolores and Bob.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.669
Yes, I know them.
I met them at the food pantry.

24:22.752 --> 24:25.755
-The food pantry!
-And your parents were okay with this?

24:26.423 --> 24:28.383
Of course they weren't okay with it.
That's the whole point.

24:28.466 --> 24:31.636
-Wait, so...
-She has gone method.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.930
-Can you please back me up?
-I just...

24:34.014 --> 24:36.349
-It was no big deal.
-[chattering]

24:36.433 --> 24:39.269
Okay, I need drinks!
Drinks? Anyone want drinks?

24:39.352 --> 24:40.395
Drinks? Drinks?

24:41.521 --> 24:43.231
-We'll be back later.
-All right.

24:44.024 --> 24:46.151
Don't they have showers
at the homeless shelter?

24:47.861 --> 24:48.695
[Grace sighs]

24:50.989 --> 24:51.907
You okay?

24:51.990 --> 24:56.328
-Yeah, that was just... intense.
-[chuckles]

24:56.411 --> 24:58.955
I mean, they're just joking around.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.791
Yeah, it just...

25:01.875 --> 25:04.794
I don't know, the way they said it
kind of sounded fucked up.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.089
They didn't mean anything by it.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.009
It's a party, it's not--

25:12.093 --> 25:14.888
-It's not a big deal.
-Yeah. No, you're right...

25:14.971 --> 25:16.056
-Right?
-Yeah.

25:16.139 --> 25:18.225
-Drinks. Yes.
-Drinks? Okay.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.398
[bell tolling]

25:44.668 --> 25:46.294
The Lord be with you.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.712
[all] And with your spirit.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.714
May Almighty God bless you.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.384
The Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

25:52.467 --> 25:53.593
[all] Amen.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.763
Go and announce the gospel of the Lord.

25:56.846 --> 25:59.015
-[all] Thanks be to God.
-[kisses]

26:00.392 --> 26:03.144
Uh, before we depart today,

26:03.228 --> 26:09.192
I want to thank a very special lamb of God
for a very special donation

26:09.276 --> 26:13.613
that has allowed us to finish
the much needed renovation of our altar.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.240
Thank you.

26:21.788 --> 26:24.708
-Are you... are you serious?
-[stammers]

26:24.791 --> 26:28.169
You... you spent $50,000 on an altar?

26:28.253 --> 26:31.798
-It hadn't been done since 1957 and--
-[Grace] You--

26:32.966 --> 26:35.969
There are starving children out there.

26:36.052 --> 26:37.596
There are homeless people,

26:37.679 --> 26:42.809
and you spent my $50,000
on an altar for you?

26:42.892 --> 26:43.935
[mumbles]

26:44.019 --> 26:46.479
-Travertine marble's very expensive.
-[Grace] So you just--

26:46.563 --> 26:49.232
Does no one else think this is insane?

26:49.941 --> 26:54.112
-Are you serious? No. [scoffs]
-[murmuring]

26:55.322 --> 26:56.156
Grace--

26:56.239 --> 26:57.073
[Grace] Don't!

26:58.825 --> 27:00.452
[Father Timothy] Nevertheless...

27:02.329 --> 27:03.830
[Stephanie] Grace!

27:05.623 --> 27:06.875
-Grace!
-What?

27:07.917 --> 27:11.212
I am so sorry. You must be so angry...

27:11.296 --> 27:12.797
How are you not?

27:13.715 --> 27:17.635
No, listen, my priorities are
not the same as Father Timothy's, okay?

27:17.719 --> 27:19.929
[laughs] Then how can you be
at this church?

27:20.513 --> 27:21.890
How can you be okay with what he did?

27:21.973 --> 27:24.684
-I gave him $50,000!
-I know. I know. I know.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.353
That could have gone to charities
that you work with.

27:26.436 --> 27:27.270
You're okay with that?

27:27.354 --> 27:29.397
I don't want you to walk away
from this experience feeling

27:29.481 --> 27:31.524
like giving is not valuable, okay?

27:31.608 --> 27:34.069
What you've done is extremely generous.

27:34.152 --> 27:39.616
How? Seriously? I gave and it got taken
from me and put to nothing.

27:39.699 --> 27:43.161
You are such a special person.
And what you've done--

27:43.244 --> 27:44.496
What does that even mean?

27:45.872 --> 27:47.082
Don't give up.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.877
Just don't give up because of this.

27:51.670 --> 27:52.796
I just did.

28:07.894 --> 28:09.062
[sighs]

28:09.145 --> 28:10.188
[Grace] I...

28:11.481 --> 28:13.775
[chuckles] just...

28:16.903 --> 28:19.823
wanted to punish them for some reason.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.284
Well, yeah.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.245
When somebody's making you do
something you don't wanna do,

28:25.328 --> 28:27.080
you wanna get back at them, obviously.

28:27.163 --> 28:28.707
I get where you're coming from, but...

28:30.375 --> 28:31.501
You're so young.

28:32.252 --> 28:35.422
Like, you will grow up to be
whoever you wanna be and...

28:36.464 --> 28:41.761
religion will seem like a minuscule,
insignificant way to get there.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.849
-Yeah.
-But it'll teach you along the way.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.519
Thanks.

28:49.602 --> 28:50.687
Come here.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.106
Don't be sad.

29:00.488 --> 29:01.322
Okay.

29:12.500 --> 29:13.585
She's just in the kitchen.

29:13.668 --> 29:16.629
-Thank you for calling us, Stephanie.
-Of course.

29:16.713 --> 29:17.797
I really appreciate it.

29:17.881 --> 29:19.758
-[Dad] Thanks, Stephanie.
-Yeah. Of course.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.887
-Come here.
-[Dad chuckles]

29:24.679 --> 29:26.222
Oh! Honey.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.435
-Stephanie told us what happened.
-[both laugh]

29:30.518 --> 29:32.520
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.607
-So sorry.
-Baby. Sweet girl.

29:36.191 --> 29:39.652
-Come here. I'm sorry, honey.
-No, I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry.

29:39.736 --> 29:42.363
I was... I was awful.

29:43.406 --> 29:46.367
-That was crazy though, right?
-Yeah. A little bit.

29:46.451 --> 29:49.037
-[Mom] Are you okay?
-I yelled at a priest.

29:49.996 --> 29:52.665
You know what? I kind of did, too.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.209
[all laugh]

29:54.292 --> 29:56.377
I guess I'm up next.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.214
It kind of felt amazing.

29:59.297 --> 30:00.340
-[Dad] Right?
-Yeah.

30:00.423 --> 30:02.884
That's okay. You don't have to go back
if you don't want to.

30:02.967 --> 30:03.927
I don't want to.

30:04.010 --> 30:06.805
-I don't think she'll be allowed to.
-Right. [chuckles]

30:06.888 --> 30:09.891
-We're really proud of you.
-We are.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.267
-Yeah?
-[Dad] Look at you.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.937
-You're pretty awesome.
-Yeah.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.897
I really like this.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.732
-This? All right.
-Yeah.

30:18.358 --> 30:19.776
I'll try it.

30:19.859 --> 30:22.153
-You will?
-Got more of those aprons?

30:22.237 --> 30:24.239
-You want an apron?
-Mm-hmm.

30:24.322 --> 30:25.323
Okay.

30:26.032 --> 30:28.952
But if you're gonna be in the kitchen,
you need gloves and hairnets, so...

30:29.035 --> 30:31.162
-We'll get out of the kitchen.
-I figured you might say that.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.414
I never felt really comfortable
in the kitchen.

30:33.498 --> 30:34.916
Just two of these?

30:35.875 --> 30:38.253
-[Dad] How are you?
-How about a loaf of bread?

30:40.046 --> 30:42.006
Do we have peanut butter?

30:42.632 --> 30:44.342
We got mac and cheese. We got fruits.

30:45.176 --> 30:47.929
Fruit time. Apple.
