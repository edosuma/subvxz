Mm-hmm.

Okay.

Yay!

(music stops)

01:57.284 --> 01:59.218
Hey, I was listening to that.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.053
Homer Simpson.

02:01.055 --> 02:03.288
Got any other sockets
in my pockets?

02:03.290 --> 02:05.724
Absolutely not.

02:05.726 --> 02:06.959
Really? Really?

02:06.961 --> 02:08.393
Really?!

02:08.395 --> 02:11.396
(groans) My one weakness--
the third "really."

02:11.398 --> 02:13.465
Come with me.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.100
(Homer grumbles, sighs)

02:15.102 --> 02:17.402
Turn right here.

02:17.404 --> 02:20.305
I keep this frozen meat
in case society collapses

02:20.307 --> 02:21.740
but we still have power.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.742
Homer! This is my freezerino.

02:23.744 --> 02:29.114
Seriously, I am getting so tired
of those stupid Flandersisms.

02:29.116 --> 02:31.116
It's the name
of the freezer!

02:31.118 --> 02:33.252
Okily Dokahama?

02:33.254 --> 02:35.988
Right next to Mount Fu-Gee,
I'm glad to see ya!

02:39.325 --> 02:40.993
Aw. It's all gonna thaw!

02:40.995 --> 02:43.462
Don't you give up on me!

02:43.464 --> 02:47.099
I'll cook this meat, cut it up
and make it into sandwiches.

02:47.101 --> 02:50.169
And I will wait and worry!

♪

03:05.451 --> 03:08.053
(no voice)

03:20.967 --> 03:24.002
So, I cooked the meat,
sliced it up, made sandwiches,

03:24.004 --> 03:26.972
cut off the crust,
fed those to the dog...

03:26.974 --> 03:29.975
Aw, somebody wants more crust.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.210
Here you go, boy!

03:35.815 --> 03:38.217
Here you go.
Have some more.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.820
Still hungry, buddy?

03:41.822 --> 03:44.189
Dad, dogs don't know
when to stop eating.

03:44.191 --> 03:45.390
Lucky.

03:46.693 --> 03:48.193
Ta-da!

03:50.997 --> 03:54.833
Oh, Marge, once again you've
taken one of my screwups

03:54.835 --> 03:56.668
and turned it into food.

03:56.670 --> 03:59.238
Man, if only you could
do that with Bart.

04:00.707 --> 04:03.842
Mom! Dad's imagining me
as food again!

04:03.844 --> 04:05.544
He does it
to all of us.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.379
Can someone put
butter on me?

04:07.381 --> 04:08.914
HOMER:
Family-icious.

04:10.516 --> 04:13.752
Come on, where's
that butter?

04:16.222 --> 04:17.856
Hey, Mom,
can you pack me

04:17.858 --> 04:20.092
a dozen sandwiches
in my lunch tomorrow?

04:20.094 --> 04:22.094
Meat, no meat,
it's all good.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.195
Sandwiches, Mom.

04:23.197 --> 04:24.196
Fill 'er up.

04:24.198 --> 04:25.230
And the garment bag.

04:25.232 --> 04:26.698
What's going on?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.600
Are you kids
eating your feelings?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.569
No, whenever anything
bothers me,

04:30.571 --> 04:32.771
I harmlessly vent it to Maggie.

04:35.208 --> 04:38.777
I smash fluorescent lights
at the gravel pit.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.712
But that's
so many sandwiches.

04:40.714 --> 04:41.713
Kids love them.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.048
We trade them
at school.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.716
They replaced cigarettes
as our currency.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.218
Bubble gum cigarettes?

04:46.220 --> 04:47.619
Yeah, sure.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.222
(doorbell rings)

04:50.224 --> 04:53.125
What are you doing here,
freezer stealer?

04:53.127 --> 04:56.728
Ned's letting us use his freezer
to store the extra sandwiches.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.731
Well, I felt a little guilty for
taking back what belonged to me.

04:59.733 --> 05:00.732
(whoops)

05:00.734 --> 05:02.267
Flanders isn't perfect!

05:02.269 --> 05:03.802
(chuckling):
Never claimed to be.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.370
Yeah, and aren't.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.642
Marge, see this face?

05:10.644 --> 05:11.777
It's opportunity.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.312
Blink, and you'll miss it.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.414
Huh?

05:15.416 --> 05:16.915
Just kidding.
I'm right behind you.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.250
I'm Trudy Zengler,

05:18.252 --> 05:20.118
vice president
of development

05:20.120 --> 05:22.421
for Mother Hubbard's
Sandwich Cupboards.

05:22.423 --> 05:26.091
How would you like to
run your own business?

05:26.093 --> 05:28.460
Take control of your
financial future.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.728
Hmm.

05:31.297 --> 05:34.433
Homie, how much money
do we have put aside

05:34.435 --> 05:37.035
in case something
happens to you?

05:39.138 --> 05:40.772
None.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.774
(groans)

05:42.776 --> 05:46.144
If that flashback you
just described is true,

05:46.146 --> 05:48.280
you can't afford not
to open this franchise.

05:48.282 --> 05:49.681
I'm in.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.954
Wow, Mom!

05:55.956 --> 05:57.356
You're gonna open
a sandwich store?

05:57.358 --> 05:58.523
Uh-huh.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.158
Mom, if you're
gonna do this,

06:00.160 --> 06:02.361
there's one thing
I need to know.

06:02.363 --> 06:03.528
And be honest.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.364
What's your soda refill policy?

06:05.366 --> 06:08.467
All you can drink,
if you buy a jumbo cup.

06:08.469 --> 06:11.403
Careful, Marge, that's
how I bankrupted a Pizza Hut.

06:13.806 --> 06:16.975
Mmm... that's good.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.378
More, more.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.179
Refill...

06:21.181 --> 06:22.381
Free!

06:22.383 --> 06:23.482
I-I just... I...

06:23.484 --> 06:24.883
Where is it going?

06:31.657 --> 06:33.859
My store.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.061
My offset spatula.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.362
Mine!

06:37.364 --> 06:38.730
(door opens, bell rings)

06:40.566 --> 06:42.401
Well, well, well.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.069
Seems like someone forgot

06:44.071 --> 06:47.406
there's a Krusty Burger
two blocks away.

06:47.408 --> 06:48.707
Go ahead, Teeny.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.942
Show 'em what we did to Arby's.

07:00.853 --> 07:04.689
She did the one thing
I never could-- feed him.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.691
You're a cool
customer, Marge.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.026
And we've got
your back.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.228
With everything from
pre-sliced tomatoes,

07:10.230 --> 07:12.364
to the homey needlepoint
on the walls.

07:12.366 --> 07:14.099
Aw...

07:14.101 --> 07:17.402
And now, the best part of
running your own franchise--

07:17.404 --> 07:19.371
picking your Sammy Fammy.

07:19.373 --> 07:20.972
You'll want to avoid that.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.780
Your monkey just
ate all my turkey.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.715
You want some monkey meat
to replace it?

07:30.717 --> 07:31.783
No.

07:31.785 --> 07:32.884
It's low-fat.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.886
GIL:
<i>As you can see, I was just two</i>

07:34.888 --> 07:36.121
<i>credits short</i>
<i>at Southern Illinois, and...</i>

07:36.123 --> 07:38.056
I got to be honest
with you, Marge.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.725
I need this job bad.

07:40.727 --> 07:44.396
Hmm... You seem to have had,
and lost, a lot of jobs.

07:44.398 --> 07:46.231
It's a whole
new world, Marge.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.799
A whole new world.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.235
Why, my dad spent his
whole life at one company.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.970
Started in the
basement mailroom,

07:51.972 --> 07:55.140
and ended his career jumping out
the window from the top floor.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.274
(groans)

07:56.276 --> 07:58.310
Yeah, he was
wearing this suit.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.377
Corpse suit.

08:03.416 --> 08:04.983
I'm not sure...

08:04.985 --> 08:06.918
this is going to work out.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.253
Oh, I get it.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.921
You won't hire me
because I'm pretty.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.256
That could be
a lawsuit.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.291
No lawsuit! You're hired!

08:13.293 --> 08:14.993
Okay, so I don't
want to do anything

08:14.995 --> 08:16.595
that'll ruin
my manicure.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.263
Well, then why do you
want this job?

08:18.265 --> 08:20.098
So I can get manicures.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.132
Duh!

08:21.134 --> 08:22.767
Professor,
could you say,

08:22.769 --> 08:25.303
"Welcome to Mother Hubbard's
Sandwich Cupboard"

08:25.305 --> 08:27.105
without making
any other noises?

08:27.107 --> 08:29.107
Of course I can, my dear child.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.308
Welcome to...

08:30.310 --> 08:31.776
Mother Hubbard's...

08:31.778 --> 08:33.778
uh... Sandwich

08:33.780 --> 08:37.782
mcboing boing glavin
flyvy hyvy goyvyn,

08:37.784 --> 08:40.185
and now I'm running
to the unemployment office.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.853
Blervyk.

08:43.122 --> 08:44.456
(Marge groaning)

08:44.458 --> 08:46.324
I'm too nervous to sleep.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.359
(Homer grunts)

08:47.361 --> 08:48.493
(sighs)

08:48.495 --> 08:49.794
(grunts sleepily)

08:49.796 --> 08:51.663
(sighs aggressively)

08:51.665 --> 08:53.298
(stammers awake)

08:53.300 --> 08:54.799
I'm sorry I
woke you up.

08:54.801 --> 08:57.502
I'm just so anxious
about tomorrow.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.004
What if the
store fails?

08:59.006 --> 09:00.372
What if I fail?

09:00.374 --> 09:03.675
Well, you woke up
the right man in bed.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.176
I love you, Marjorie.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.679
And I've had my share
of failures, sure.

09:07.681 --> 09:10.181
And sometimes
I get pretty nervous.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.551
But thanks for
talking it out with me.

09:12.553 --> 09:15.353
I think I can finally
get to sleep now.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.721
No! No, no, no!

09:16.723 --> 09:18.490
It was me that
couldn't get to...

09:18.492 --> 09:20.325
(snoring)

09:20.327 --> 09:22.327
(sighs)

09:22.329 --> 09:23.528
(stammers awake)

09:23.530 --> 09:24.863
Oh, make love now?

09:24.865 --> 09:26.565
(groans)

09:27.500 --> 09:29.534
Say there, buddy,

09:29.536 --> 09:32.003
are you interested
in our Two-For-One Tuesday?

09:32.005 --> 09:34.072
I never would have been,
till I got this flyer!

09:34.074 --> 09:36.541
Interested in some
exotic dancers, huh?

09:36.543 --> 09:39.377
Today's "Tell You
Their Real Name" Tuesday.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.546
Are you working
two jobs here, Gil?

09:41.548 --> 09:44.683
No, and I resent
the accusation.

09:44.685 --> 09:47.352
Tell me, it's
pointing west, right?

09:47.354 --> 09:48.920
<i>Hola.</i>

09:48.922 --> 09:50.689
No change
for the meter.

09:50.691 --> 09:54.059
No, no, I'd like
to see the manager.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.560
Mrs. Boss!

09:55.562 --> 09:57.596
Some fat blob wants
to see you.

09:57.598 --> 09:58.597
MARGE:
Homer!

09:58.599 --> 09:59.598
Marge.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.865
Come on, let's celebrate!

10:00.867 --> 10:02.033
It's your first day!

10:02.035 --> 10:03.768
Homie, I'm
a little worried.

10:03.770 --> 10:08.273
Do you know there were no
customers between 2:00 and 4:00?

10:08.275 --> 10:11.543
Hey, Tony Roma's wasn't
built in a day.

10:11.545 --> 10:14.279
But don't worry, I told everyone
about this place,

10:14.281 --> 10:16.214
and they're all going
to support you.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.782
You do have drone delivery,
right?

10:17.784 --> 10:18.917
I kind of promised that.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.885
We don't have drone delivery!

10:20.887 --> 10:22.721
You'll have
to find a substitute.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.056
(humming a tune)

10:25.058 --> 10:26.458
HOMER:
Damn it!

10:27.560 --> 10:29.861
(humming)

10:32.064 --> 10:34.366
(Marge groaning)

10:36.469 --> 10:37.736
(groans)

10:37.738 --> 10:38.970
What's wrong?

10:38.972 --> 10:41.306
Mother Hubbard Central
expects you to buy

10:41.308 --> 10:43.241
a lot of stuff
from them.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.143
Uniforms, fixin's.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.078
It's like they don't care
if you make money

10:47.080 --> 10:48.747
as long as
they make money.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.316
What kind of corporation
does that?

10:52.918 --> 10:55.153
(stammers) I'm not trying
to be political,

10:55.155 --> 10:58.390
but I'm the only one
you can trust here.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.159
(gasps)

11:02.328 --> 11:05.130
Shauna! I saw that!

11:05.132 --> 11:06.931
I'm going to have
to let you go.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.667
Oh, so you're,
like, firing me

11:08.669 --> 11:10.969
like in that movie
where that girl gets fired?

11:10.971 --> 11:12.303
I'm sorry.

11:12.305 --> 11:13.338
If I'm fired,

11:13.340 --> 11:14.339
then he's quitting!

11:14.341 --> 11:16.341
I am?!

11:16.343 --> 11:19.778
Oh, that's what
holds them up.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.147
What am I going to do?

11:22.149 --> 11:24.482
I'm down two employees
and it's the afternoon rush.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.785
(bell dings)

11:26.787 --> 11:28.453
I need a six-foot party sub.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.955
Lots of mayonnaise.
And I mean lots.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.824
Never stop squirting mayo.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.459
Don't worry, baby.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.928
(humming a tune)

11:41.367 --> 11:43.635
Thank you, Homie.

11:43.637 --> 11:46.638
Why does this have
to be so hard?!

11:46.640 --> 11:49.174
Oh, uh, sorry
there, Marge.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.176
This is my changing room.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.478
You are working two jobs!

11:53.480 --> 11:55.380
No, these are my real legs.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.249
I'm... I'm not a
well man, Marge.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.487
This is so sad.

12:02.489 --> 12:05.657
In his homeland,
Dad was a nuclear engineer.

12:05.659 --> 12:08.993
Oh, I was short-staffed
and your father volunteered.

12:08.995 --> 12:12.564
Actually, I was wondering if you
two might want to lend a hand.

12:12.566 --> 12:13.998
No, no.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.167
You want to make
American kids work?

12:16.169 --> 12:17.535
You're supposed
to be driving me

12:17.537 --> 12:19.370
to a tennis class
I said I wanted,

12:19.372 --> 12:22.006
then I changed my mind
and I hate it so much

12:22.008 --> 12:23.742
I'm faking stomachaches
to get out of it.

12:23.744 --> 12:26.211
Would it kill one of you
to wash a bell pepper?

12:26.213 --> 12:28.713
Um, I'm not sure this is
the best use of my skills.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.014
I said wash!

12:30.016 --> 12:32.250
And, Bart, go work
the deep fryer.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.419
Well, if I'll be doing this
when I'm 40,

12:34.421 --> 12:36.521
might as well start now.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.590
(humming a tune)

12:41.060 --> 12:42.594
(gasps)

12:42.596 --> 12:44.262
I'm home.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.698
Guys, this is gonna be
hard for a while.

12:46.700 --> 12:49.200
But we'll get through this
as a family.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.902
Yes, we will.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.872
The Simpsons
and old Uncle Gil.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.874
Uh, Gil?

12:55.876 --> 12:58.209
I've been meaning to
tell you you're fired.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.879
Yeah, well,
guess I had it coming.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.914
Can I take
some bologna heels?

13:02.916 --> 13:04.048
As many as you like.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.116
You sure?

13:05.118 --> 13:06.718
Take them!

13:06.720 --> 13:09.754
Aw, yeah!
It's a big ol' fat one!

Real good baby.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.271
Good everybody.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.639
You won't believe it,

14:01.641 --> 14:04.509
but we actually turned
a profit today.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.813
Kids, we're taking
some shredded lettuce,

14:08.815 --> 14:11.816
pre-sliced cheese and cold cuts,

14:11.818 --> 14:16.621
and turning them
into the American dream.

14:16.623 --> 14:19.424
Uh, guys,
what the hell is that?

14:22.862 --> 14:24.195
(gasps)

14:24.197 --> 14:26.030
They're opening
another Mother Hubbard?

14:26.032 --> 14:28.967
Across the street?!
How could they?

14:28.969 --> 14:30.335
How could they?!

14:30.337 --> 14:32.904
CHIEF WIGGUM:
Move, move, move!

14:36.508 --> 14:38.009
Eh, Chief, uh,
who are you fooling

14:38.011 --> 14:40.044
with this one sandwich
a day diet?

14:40.046 --> 14:42.013
It's on whole wheat, Lou.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.549
Cleans up your insides.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.950
I'm gonna sit
next to it.

14:50.322 --> 14:53.191
How could they open another
franchise so close to me?

14:53.193 --> 14:55.493
Don't worry, Marge.
They can't beat us.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.228
Because we're family-run.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.731
Aah! Hillbillies!

15:01.400 --> 15:04.903
Okay, in you go,
Minimum Wade, Addem-up,

15:04.905 --> 15:08.673
Oxycontin, Fontanelle
and Pediculus.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.075
You make way for those
that's nocturnal

15:11.077 --> 15:13.044
coming off the night shift.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.679
(squealing)

15:14.681 --> 15:16.414
Huh?

15:18.350 --> 15:19.417
(sighs)

15:19.419 --> 15:21.419
(yawns)

15:21.421 --> 15:23.855
Mom, I need a few hours off.

15:23.857 --> 15:26.691
It's Milhouse's birthday party
and I'm all the guests.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.192
I understand, honey.

15:28.194 --> 15:30.428
Did you get someone to cover?
Mm. Grampa.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.430
I'm working the drive-through!

15:32.432 --> 15:34.365
There is no drive-through!

15:34.367 --> 15:35.533
(coos)

15:35.535 --> 15:38.670
No, thank coo!

15:41.540 --> 15:43.207
(sighs)

15:43.209 --> 15:45.910
(door opens, bell dings)
Ah, finally-- a customer!

15:45.912 --> 15:47.545
Aah!

15:47.547 --> 15:48.947
Simpson,
why aren't you at work?

15:48.949 --> 15:51.049
Whoa, hold
that famous temper, Smithers.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.184
Who is this?

15:56.388 --> 15:58.289
Simpson, introduce me
to this almond-eyed beauty,

15:58.291 --> 16:00.391
and all is forgiven.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.460
Uh, Mr. Burns, I'd
like you to meet...

16:02.462 --> 16:04.562
Mother Hubbard standee.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.464
From the Wisconsin Standees!

16:06.466 --> 16:09.300
Milk-fed, yet so slim.

16:09.302 --> 16:13.137
Permit me to play you a tune
on my mouth organ.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.739
Sir, maybe we should go.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.107
Sorry you died!

16:16.109 --> 16:18.643
Put the body with the others.

16:21.413 --> 16:22.981
Whew.

16:22.983 --> 16:25.083
Homer, if I ever
seem that senile,

16:25.085 --> 16:26.617
get a gun and...

16:26.619 --> 16:28.853
What are you doing
with that gun?!

16:29.822 --> 16:30.955
Marge, have you ever

16:30.957 --> 16:31.990
seen pants do this?

16:31.992 --> 16:33.491
(gasps)

16:33.493 --> 16:36.494
You're working so hard
you've lost weight!

16:36.496 --> 16:38.096
We're killing ourselves
trying to run

16:38.098 --> 16:40.331
a restaurant no one goes to.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.000
I've never said
this to you before,

16:42.002 --> 16:43.501
but I'm saying it now.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.670
I'm going to Moe's.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.872
(gasps)

16:49.141 --> 16:51.642
Now I know why you
come here so much.

16:51.644 --> 16:54.278
No matter how sad
you are inside,

16:54.280 --> 16:56.447
what you see looks worse.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.649
Yeah. It was really hard
for me to make this place

16:58.651 --> 17:01.019
look old but not
in any way comfortable.

17:01.021 --> 17:03.621
Now maybe some
TV will cheer you up.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.624
If you's in the mood
for a sammich, come on down

17:06.626 --> 17:09.360
to Mother Hubbard's
Sandwich Cupboard Express,

17:09.362 --> 17:11.996
for all the sandwiches you love!

17:11.998 --> 17:13.164
Bread sammich.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.332
Yesterday's what's-it

17:14.334 --> 17:15.666
with ketchup.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.869
And the thing
what ate our chickens.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.471
BRANDINE:
Looks like a fox, but it ain't.

17:20.473 --> 17:24.542
Be sure to follow us
on Kinterest and Critter!

17:25.978 --> 17:28.513
Aw! "Yesterday's what's-it"?

17:28.515 --> 17:30.515
Why does everyone go to them?

17:30.517 --> 17:32.350
It's express, Marge.

17:32.352 --> 17:35.286
Yeah, with our busy lifestyle,
we got to have express.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.159
Aw. Listen there, Midge.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.861
I know how to get yous
out of your contract.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.396
But I got to warn you...

17:45.398 --> 17:48.166
you will never work in the
fast-food industry again.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.401
Go on. Please.

17:51.837 --> 17:53.704
<i>So, you see, Ms. Zengler,</i>

17:53.706 --> 17:55.907
the Mother Hubbard's Express
across the street

17:55.909 --> 17:58.209
is stealing all our business.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.844
It's not fair.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.380
If you want fairness,
work at a Sunglass Hut.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.515
This is the sandwich game.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.084
I don't understand you.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.685
I grew up in the
pageant system.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.888
Oh. Now I completely
understand you.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.924
I'm a litigious
businessman,

18:12.926 --> 18:15.259
and I need a
coffee to go.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.462
One jumbo Joe to go!

18:19.565 --> 18:21.365
(yells in pain)

18:21.367 --> 18:23.367
Get the first-aid kit!

18:23.369 --> 18:25.236
One Florence Nightingale
in a box!

18:25.238 --> 18:26.737
And make it snappy!

18:26.739 --> 18:28.773
Ow!

18:28.775 --> 18:30.741
I got this.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.243
Ow!

18:32.245 --> 18:35.246
Oh, why do these things happen
to innocent victims?

18:35.248 --> 18:37.248
I was just
about to become

18:37.250 --> 18:39.884
a million-dollar
crotch model!

18:39.886 --> 18:42.553
Hey, hey, hey!
It's not corporate's fault!

18:42.555 --> 18:43.554
Really?

18:43.556 --> 18:45.223
But the franchise
agreement says

18:45.225 --> 18:47.091
Mother Hubbard Inc. would
provide adequate training

18:47.093 --> 18:49.393
for all employees,
which they didn't.

18:49.395 --> 18:52.396
Clause 27C-3.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.232
(scoffs)
You actually read this thing?

18:54.234 --> 18:56.067
It was written
by two lawyers who had

18:56.069 --> 18:57.768
to keep waking the other one up.

18:57.770 --> 19:01.239
If you'll just give me back
my original investment,

19:01.241 --> 19:04.442
I'll take full responsibility
for this man's injuries.

19:04.444 --> 19:08.412
Please... tell me
I'm still beautiful!

19:08.414 --> 19:10.815
All right, Marge.
You've got a deal.

19:15.787 --> 19:17.755
Well, family, we
should be proud.

19:17.757 --> 19:20.992
We took on corporate
America and broke even.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.593
Hear, hear!

19:22.595 --> 19:24.128
Sir?

19:24.130 --> 19:26.264
I-I think we've
gone far enough

19:26.266 --> 19:27.598
to dispose of the body.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.100
Dispose? Ooh.

19:29.102 --> 19:31.636
I've come here to pitch woo.
