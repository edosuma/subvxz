Oh, more prima donna crap?

01:10.121 --> 01:11.588
Again? Really?

01:11.655 --> 01:13.257
You know Vaughn.
When the mood strikes,

01:13.323 --> 01:15.325
he has to write.
No matter the timing.

01:15.692 --> 01:17.228
You know, it's funny.
You tolerate this

01:17.327 --> 01:19.130

01:23.100 --> 01:25.069
Oh, no. Jealous ex-boyfriend.

01:25.136 --> 01:27.104
You know, I tolerate it
because Vaughn is the star.

01:27.205 --> 01:29.439
- <i>We want Vaughn! We want Vaughn!</i>
- Vaughn's the star?

01:29.506 --> 01:31.108
Do we all
think that Vaughn is the star?

01:31.175 --> 01:32.310

01:39.050 --> 01:41.219
Right. Okay. I will do a solo.

01:41.551 --> 01:43.054

- Yeah, is... yeah, clever.

06:17.194 --> 06:19.463
All right well,
I have an announcement.

06:19.530 --> 06:21.098
- So...
- About what?

06:21.198 --> 06:23.633
You turned down another one
of Pedro's marriage proposals?

06:23.700 --> 06:25.702
Hey, I'm not in the band,

06:25.769 --> 06:27.104
I get to be honest. And...

06:27.905 --> 06:30.174

I let you degenerates

06:30.241 --> 06:31.542

I interrupted y'all's meeting.

- Let me get you a drink.
- Wait, wait. No, no, no.

06:39.583 --> 06:40.618
Sit down.
I have an announcement.

06:40.717 --> 06:42.419
Okay.
What's the announcement, sis?

06:42.486 --> 06:44.321
All right. As all of you know,

06:44.488 --> 06:47.825
Arcade Fire is doing three shows
at the Bowl starting on Friday.

06:47.992 --> 06:50.494

because every single one of you

06:50.594 --> 06:53.397
ass-bags has badgered me
for comp tickets.

06:53.497 --> 06:56.133
You got the tickets.
I know it!

06:56.267 --> 06:57.401
No, Darby. I'm so sorry.

06:57.501 --> 07:00.703
I'm not a miracle worker,
but we are going to the concert

07:01.005 --> 07:06.210
because we are the opening act
for all three L.A. shows.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.912

- Whoo!

07:08.145 --> 07:08.913
Whoo-hoo!

11:37.381 --> 11:38.949

a song yesterday.

11:39.183 --> 11:40.517

11:40.819 --> 11:41.786

11:58.368 --> 12:00.137

13:02.767 --> 13:05.235

ever since I can remember.

13:05.602 --> 13:08.006
He doesn't even play.
He can't even air guitar.

13:08.105 --> 13:11.009
But I asked him
if we could loan it to you.

13:11.141 --> 13:13.343

13:13.477 --> 13:16.814
and we know your family is,
you know, broke ass.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.516

13:20.818 --> 13:21.953
I really get to keep this?

13:22.020 --> 13:23.220
For now.

13:23.520 --> 13:26.623
Besides, you have to upgrade
from that crappy plastic guitar

13:26.690 --> 13:27.724
you probably got at...

13:28.492 --> 13:30.127
Target when you were,
like, five.

13:30.494 --> 13:32.095
It was at Big Lots
when I was seven.

13:32.195 --> 13:33.998

I gotta go get my lunch.

13:34.097 --> 13:36.233
Okay, this thing is heavy, man.

13:36.300 --> 13:37.634
I know. Right over here.

13:37.769 --> 13:39.804
- Hey, Dad.
- Good Morning, Em.

13:39.971 --> 13:42.072
- How's it hangin', Oak?
- Morning, Mr. Biggs.

13:42.339 --> 13:43.640
Thanks for the guitar.

13:43.808 --> 13:44.876
This thing is amazing!

13:44.976 --> 13:46.243
Oh, you're welcome, son.

13:46.543 --> 13:48.980
And call me D.B.
Everybody calls me D.B.

13:49.413 --> 13:51.582
- Okay, Mr. Biggs.
- Come here.

13:51.849 --> 13:54.151
- Mm. Love you.
- Love you.

13:56.186 --> 13:57.421
- D.B.
- Yeah.

13:58.121 --> 13:59.991
Who... who was that?

14:00.090 --> 14:01.124
A new tenant upstairs.

14:01.191 --> 14:03.061
His mom's
a little out there, but...

14:03.226 --> 14:04.829
Emma's helping him
navigate school.

14:04.929 --> 14:06.330
So you just gave him
Vaughn's guitar?

14:06.463 --> 14:08.498
Technically I'm just loaning it.
And the kid can play.

14:08.599 --> 14:11.201
And you know better than anyone,
you use it or you lose it.

14:11.368 --> 14:13.370
- Figured he could use it.
- Could've given it to me.

14:13.838 --> 14:16.673
But no, you give to some kid
you don't even know. All right.

14:27.919 --> 14:29.286
Hey, Gina.

14:29.620 --> 14:30.587
Uh,

14:30.922 --> 14:32.589
it's been a long time.

14:33.323 --> 14:35.158
Uh, I just, um...

14:35.893 --> 14:37.361
I just saw Vaughn's old guitar.

14:37.427 --> 14:40.230
And it just hit me like a wave.

15:18.903 --> 15:20.838
- <i>Sheamus McNamara.</i>
- Here's a note from your mom.

15:20.905 --> 15:21.939

15:34.786 --> 15:36.286
Oh. Here, sorry.

15:42.192 --> 15:43.193
Loser.

15:43.427 --> 15:44.996
You still need
to be with your mom

15:45.063 --> 15:46.130
for her parent conference.

15:46.530 --> 15:48.933
There's little more to parenting
than writing notes for truancy.

15:49.033 --> 15:50.300
Okay, Mr. Travis.

15:53.071 --> 15:54.172
You go jog.

15:54.271 --> 15:55.973
- No you go jog.
- Yeah.

15:56.074 --> 15:57.909
- Hey, hey, dude. Hang on...
- Oh...

15:58.442 --> 16:00.310
- Let's get him.
- Yeah, yeah.

16:00.744 --> 16:01.813
Check it out.

16:02.612 --> 16:03.380
Go long.

16:03.580 --> 16:05.549
Nailed it.

16:06.150 --> 16:07.684
Come and get it.

16:08.685 --> 16:09.921
Give it back.

16:10.021 --> 16:12.522
Come on. Wes.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.691
Don't be a jerk.

16:15.159 --> 16:16.560
Yeah.

16:21.065 --> 16:22.299
Nice one.

16:24.869 --> 16:26.804
Is this a monkey or your mom?

16:26.904 --> 16:28.238
It's a red butt monkey.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.842
What are you gonna do about
that monkey butt?

16:30.975 --> 16:32.542
Gonna tell your drug addict mom?

16:32.609 --> 16:34.711
Everybody knows
your mom's a drug addict.

16:34.846 --> 16:35.712
My dad saw her at 7/11

16:35.813 --> 16:37.314
buying all that stuff
that makes you shit.

16:37.514 --> 16:39.282
He says drug addicts
have to take that stuff

16:39.349 --> 16:40.785
'cause they can't shit.

16:41.052 --> 16:42.854
You sad?
Why don't you cry then?

16:42.920 --> 16:43.921
Hey!

16:44.122 --> 16:45.223
Get away from him right now!

16:45.555 --> 16:48.860
- Or what?
- You lose a fight to a girl.

16:49.093 --> 16:50.360
I would totally win.

16:50.494 --> 16:53.064
Win or lose,
you're not gonna look too good

16:53.164 --> 16:54.832
on everyone's Instagram, huh?

16:59.436 --> 17:00.704
I thought so.

17:01.205 --> 17:02.439
Give him the journal.

17:02.940 --> 17:03.975
Now.

17:06.911 --> 17:08.612
Here, Oak.

17:08.946 --> 17:11.548
- Thanks, Randall.
- Don't thank this cheese-dick.

17:11.615 --> 17:12.516
Hey.

17:14.986 --> 17:16.154
Yeah, you better walk away.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.189
- Quiet.
- Punk.

17:18.622 --> 17:20.224
I can take care of myself,
you know.

17:20.323 --> 17:21.893
Yeah, no.

17:22.359 --> 17:24.095
Oh, yeah.
By the way, Mr. Travis

17:24.162 --> 17:25.096
totally believed it.

17:25.263 --> 17:26.563
You're so good

17:50.755 --> 17:52.857
You know what,
with your white face

17:52.924 --> 17:56.027
and middling talent,
you should be just fine.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.594
- Right on.
- Yup.

17:58.229 --> 17:59.529
Tell you what, uh,

17:59.629 --> 18:01.364
why don't you just take the rest

- Yeah.

18:02.499 --> 18:03.600
All right.

18:03.733 --> 18:04.467
Hey, Pedro.

18:04.601 --> 18:06.369
Hey, what's up, girl?

18:07.205 --> 18:10.574
I hear your, uh, friend's got
some, uh, sick skills?

18:10.707 --> 18:12.342
- Sure does.
- I'm not that good.

18:12.442 --> 18:15.046
- I need to get better.
- Well, you wanna get better?

18:15.612 --> 18:17.281
Pedro's one of the best

18:17.447 --> 18:19.283

for that old punk band

18:19.382 --> 18:21.786
- not that long ago, right?
- Yes. Green Day.

18:21.986 --> 18:24.288
Whoa, those guys
could still really rock it.

18:24.454 --> 18:26.157
So, why aren't you
successful, man?

18:26.324 --> 18:28.358
Uh, I mean...
No, you know, that's not what...

18:28.425 --> 18:30.261
Let's just pretend
you said none of that.

18:30.594 --> 18:32.029
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

18:32.196 --> 18:33.530
I can't afford lessons.

18:33.630 --> 18:35.732
I'm self-taught.
YouTube, mostly.

18:36.100 --> 18:36.834
Interesting.

18:37.068 --> 18:39.270
And yet Emma gives you
Vaughn's old guitar.

18:39.402 --> 18:40.771
- Yeah.
- Why don't we go inside?

18:40.938 --> 18:42.572
You show me
a little something on the stage

18:42.639 --> 18:44.809
and I'll give you
a few free lessons.

18:45.542 --> 18:46.911
That sounds good.

18:50.447 --> 18:51.681
Any requests?

18:52.716 --> 18:53.650
Surprise us.

19:16.073 --> 19:17.474
Whoa.

19:18.009 --> 19:19.442

19:19.911 --> 19:21.478
- Ten.
- Holy shit!

19:21.544 --> 19:23.680
I mean, wow,
I shouldn't be cussing.

19:23.781 --> 19:24.782
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

19:24.882 --> 19:26.851
- I say shit sometimes.
- Me, too. I say shit.

19:26.918 --> 19:29.486
No, no, no. You talk shit.
Big difference.

19:29.719 --> 19:31.554
So you givin' him lessons,
or what?

19:31.621 --> 19:32.522
Hell, yes, I am.

19:32.589 --> 19:34.125
Kid, show me what else you got.

19:41.598 --> 19:45.735

21:11.554 --> 21:15.192
Oh, damn. You aged well.

Hey, uh, you, too.

21:28.472 --> 21:30.841
- Can I see it?
- I... I don't have it.

21:31.876 --> 21:34.544
No, D.B. gave it, uh...
Sorry, he loaned it so some kid.

21:34.611 --> 21:37.048
What kid?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what kid?

21:37.114 --> 21:38.349
Because he... he...
he can't do that.

21:38.416 --> 21:39.749
It's not his guitar
to just give.

21:39.817 --> 21:41.651
- Yeah, but nobody was using it.
- Well, I need it.

21:41.752 --> 21:42.920
Why do you need it?

21:45.389 --> 21:47.224
- You okay?
- I'm... I'm fine. It's just...

21:47.792 --> 21:49.860
God, how could you let D.B.
do that?

21:49.927 --> 21:51.362
Just give away Vaughn's guitar
to some kid

21:51.429 --> 21:52.562
- he doesn't even know?
- Look,

21:52.662 --> 21:53.730

21:53.798 --> 21:54.865
he's gonna be
at the shop tomorrow.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.467
You should come by
and pick it up yourself.

Fine, I will.

21:57.734 --> 21:58.936

Gina, you okay?

26:23.500 --> 26:24.201
I'm okay.

26:24.435 --> 26:26.270
Look, we can get the kid
another guitar.

26:26.370 --> 26:27.905
It's no big deal.

26:30.674 --> 26:31.575
I'm Gina.

26:31.776 --> 26:34.278
- Oak.
- Oak? Like a tree?

26:34.478 --> 26:35.446
Like, a...

26:35.946 --> 26:37.047
mighty oak?

26:37.748 --> 26:38.916
I guess so, yeah.

26:39.917 --> 26:41.418
It's nice to meet you, Oak.

26:42.052 --> 26:43.721
You, uh, know anything
about the man

26:43.788 --> 26:45.122
who owned that Taylor?

26:46.123 --> 26:48.992
Vaughn Jackson.
Lead singer of Army of Love.

26:49.059 --> 26:50.394
You're his sister, right?

26:50.994 --> 26:53.731
Vaughn and I,
we met Pedro in school,

26:53.798 --> 26:55.399
and we formed Army
when we were just, uh,

26:55.733 --> 26:57.201
few years older than you.

26:57.401 --> 26:59.903
- What were we? Thirteen?
- Yeah. Thirteen.

27:00.037 --> 27:02.807
Uh, so Oak here
spent the whole night

27:02.906 --> 27:04.809
memorizing every single
one of our tracks.

27:04.908 --> 27:06.877
My favorite songs
are "Bad", "Blue Silver",

27:06.944 --> 27:08.746
- and "Perfect".
- Vaughn wrote all those.

27:08.813 --> 27:11.315
Yeah, and you love
"Runaway" and "Tokyo", right?

27:11.382 --> 27:12.817
Yeah,
I just think Vaughn's stuff

27:12.883 --> 27:14.651
is a little tighter, though,
you know?

27:16.987 --> 27:19.758
Okay. Yeah.
You are just like him.

27:20.157 --> 27:21.492
Yeah, you are just...

27:21.959 --> 27:23.527
Uh, you're very talented.

27:23.927 --> 27:25.062
Thanks.

27:26.330 --> 27:27.264
That him?

27:33.103 --> 27:33.838
Yeah.

27:34.438 --> 27:37.141
You really do remind me of him.
A lot.

27:37.341 --> 27:39.543
But I'm better looking
than that, right?

27:43.447 --> 27:45.916
Come on.
Let's go practice some more. Ah!

27:46.016 --> 27:48.452
What do you say we do "Tokyo"?

27:48.887 --> 27:49.920
No. I'm good.

27:51.155 --> 27:53.457
Okay. Well, you pick. Let's go.

27:53.858 --> 27:55.025
Okay. Uh...

27:55.726 --> 27:56.660
"Blue Silver".

28:09.673 --> 28:11.341
Do you believe in reincarnation?

28:13.845 --> 28:16.881
All my brother and I did
was play baseball

28:16.980 --> 28:18.715
with my father growing up.

28:19.049 --> 28:21.618
Two weeks into my senior year,
he died.

28:22.519 --> 28:25.890
It was the year we competed
at the State Championships.

28:26.323 --> 28:28.425
The day before the big game,

28:28.592 --> 28:30.427
this fat corgi mutt,

28:30.527 --> 28:32.764
he comes wandering into
our backyard.

28:32.831 --> 28:35.332
Now we bring the dog in,
feed him.

28:35.499 --> 28:38.803
The next morning,
this jolly beer-scented dog

28:38.937 --> 28:40.337
comes to the game...

28:41.071 --> 28:42.239
and watched the whole thing.

28:42.606 --> 28:44.741
Sat above the dugout,
next to my mom.

28:45.976 --> 28:48.145
Now, logically,
I know that it's impossible

28:48.245 --> 28:51.783
that this fat corgi
is the reincarnation of my dad.

28:52.349 --> 28:55.753
But anything's possible.

28:55.986 --> 28:57.889
You know why
I wanted that guitar so bad?

28:57.956 --> 28:58.890
Hmm?

28:59.323 --> 29:01.258
It's worth about three grand.

29:04.027 --> 29:06.430
Yeah. Yeah. Looks pretty bad.

29:08.165 --> 29:09.533
Come work for me.

29:10.701 --> 29:12.804
I can't pay a lot but...

29:13.270 --> 29:15.706
it'll be enough
to keep you out of trouble.

29:17.809 --> 29:20.912
I love you, D.B.
Thank you. Okay.

29:21.278 --> 29:23.882
And you're gonna be okay
working with Pedro?

29:25.917 --> 29:27.919
- Why wouldn't I be?
- Don't bullshit me!

29:27.986 --> 29:29.954
There is nothing there anymore.

29:30.320 --> 29:32.556
I mean, beside,
Pedro wanted kids.

29:32.656 --> 29:35.092
I'm sure he got a little left
in the tank for you.

29:35.225 --> 29:37.327
No, I have a kid.
His name is Larry

29:37.427 --> 29:39.429
and his shits
are the size of Coke cans.

29:41.966 --> 29:44.134

30:21.238 --> 30:23.507
Okay, stay, stay, stay.
Stay.

30:32.951 --> 30:35.385
- Hey, morning, you!
- Morning.

30:36.486 --> 30:38.856
So, uh, wait a minute,
D.B. hired you,

30:38.923 --> 30:40.058
but did he hire Larry, too?

30:40.123 --> 30:42.259
Well, he eats my sofa
if I'm gone for longer

30:42.326 --> 30:44.361
than two hours, so we're,
kind of, a package deal.

30:44.695 --> 30:46.530
You won't even know he's here.

30:47.397 --> 30:48.465
Hey, no.

30:48.699 --> 30:50.902
Great.
How long is your shift?

30:51.201 --> 30:53.537
Here all day.
Are you gonna show me the ropes?

30:56.206 --> 30:57.474
What's up with you?

30:58.009 --> 30:58.910
Nothing. What...

30:59.077 --> 31:00.711
Uh-uh.
Something 's different.

31:00.778 --> 31:01.712
What... What's going on?

31:01.946 --> 31:03.347
Why would anything be up?

31:03.447 --> 31:06.650
Oh, come on. I know you so well.
Talk to me.

31:06.784 --> 31:08.218
Oh, that's debatable.
Come on.

31:14.792 --> 31:17.762
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but listen to this. The flow.

31:17.929 --> 31:19.563
The infectious drum beat.

31:19.663 --> 31:22.100
Now that'll get
your juices flowin', eh?

31:22.165 --> 31:23.901
Army of Love.

31:24.401 --> 31:25.103
Now, look.

31:25.435 --> 31:27.270
I know you came in here
looking for Stones,

31:27.337 --> 31:30.741
but let's be honest, love,
Stones, I mean, look.

31:30.942 --> 31:33.644
Look, it's for your mom,
honestly.

31:34.078 --> 31:35.013
Army of Love.

31:35.145 --> 31:37.514
Now that is
for the sexy people like us.

31:37.949 --> 31:42.053
Now, this one, look,
our first album <i>Self-Guy Old.</i>

31:42.152 --> 31:44.621
Second one, <i>Suburban,</i>
pretty good.

31:44.889 --> 31:46.289
This third one, well, this one...

31:46.356 --> 31:48.893
this one when he got all weird,
but I like this...

31:49.393 --> 31:51.029
Well, she... she's gone.

31:51.361 --> 31:53.430
All right. Well...

31:55.298 --> 31:57.734
Army of Love meeting
at Lestat's.

31:57.802 --> 31:59.636
Band back together!

32:00.071 --> 32:02.006
Woo-hoo!

32:04.142 --> 32:05.308
Piss it.

32:06.343 --> 32:08.913
So you serve avocado, right?

32:09.113 --> 32:11.916
And you serve toast, right?

32:12.315 --> 32:14.451
So, then you do
serve avocado toast.

32:14.651 --> 32:16.520
Tell your manager
to make that happen.

32:16.921 --> 32:18.622
Can you handle that, Alex?

32:19.356 --> 32:20.792
I am the manager,

32:21.291 --> 32:23.360
and I'm sorry,
we don't have avocado toast.

32:24.996 --> 32:26.030
This is my nightmare.

32:26.130 --> 32:27.597
Are you even listening to me?

32:33.403 --> 32:36.140
Do you see this faint image
right here of President Jackson?

32:36.573 --> 32:38.843
Even on old bills,
it's actually visible

32:38.910 --> 32:40.343
from both sides too...

32:40.510 --> 32:41.378
Yo!

32:41.545 --> 32:43.915
Now what do a couple
of degenerates have to do

32:43.981 --> 32:45.482
to get a drink around here?

32:45.549 --> 32:47.551
- Come here.
- Oh, my God.

32:48.786 --> 32:50.154
Pedro.

32:50.220 --> 32:51.923
All right. Thank you. You.

32:52.056 --> 32:53.323
How you fools doing, huh?

32:53.623 --> 32:56.326
Still foolish, man.
Good to see you.

32:56.426 --> 32:57.360
It... it really is.

32:57.795 --> 33:00.164
Oh, wait, are you guys here
'cause you need jobs, too?

33:00.230 --> 33:01.698
No.
We're here because Gina told us

33:01.799 --> 33:04.334
that she might have a way
of reuniting the band.

33:04.401 --> 33:05.970
Oh, did she?

33:06.137 --> 33:07.504
She did. And she will.

33:08.005 --> 33:09.841
Okay.
We'll, uh, Gina and I

33:09.941 --> 33:11.675
need to just take a moment
real quick. So...

33:11.776 --> 33:12.810
- We do?
- We do.

33:15.213 --> 33:16.747
What the hell are you thinking?

33:17.380 --> 33:19.449
Oh, you're just mad
you didn't think of it first.

33:19.516 --> 33:21.251
No. No, I'm mad
because you're giving them

33:21.351 --> 33:22.887
false hope.
There's no reunion.

33:23.054 --> 33:24.654
Mom and dad already fighting.

33:24.889 --> 33:25.589
Have a little imagination.

33:25.722 --> 33:26.958
I can't believe
you don't see it.

33:27.125 --> 33:28.391
Tell me, what kind
of marketing stunt

33:28.458 --> 33:31.129
- are you trying to pull?
- It's not a marketing stunt.

33:31.595 --> 33:34.364
You know what, just shut up,
get out there, and play.

33:34.531 --> 33:36.600
Where did Gina
dig this guy up from, huh?

33:36.666 --> 33:38.435
She find him in a tribute band
or something?

33:38.535 --> 33:40.737
- We have a tribute band?
- Well, if we don't, we should.

33:40.805 --> 33:42.940
He's definitely not
from a tribute band.

33:43.007 --> 33:43.707
Well, at least,

33:43.975 --> 33:46.010
please tell me he's different
from Vaughn.

33:46.177 --> 33:47.744
Otherwise we'll seem pathetic.

33:48.045 --> 33:49.981
Hey, you guys. All right.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.083
Are you guys ready
to meet your new front man?

33:52.150 --> 33:54.919
Let's meet the bastard
crazy enough to join this crew.

33:55.153 --> 33:56.419
Come on, sweetie.

34:03.426 --> 34:05.729
Oh, my God, it's Army of Love!

34:05.997 --> 34:09.666
Um, please tell me this is
a Make-A-Wish Foundation thing.

34:09.801 --> 34:11.635
Does it look like
a Make-A-Wish Foundation thing?

34:11.701 --> 34:13.805
I don't know what a Make-A-Wish
Foundation thing looks like,

34:13.871 --> 34:16.439
- but this better be it!
- Guys, this isn't a joke, okay?

34:16.540 --> 34:17.440
Listen to him play.

34:17.607 --> 34:19.277
Gina,
I know you're a little crazy,

34:19.342 --> 34:21.444
but I didn't think
you were Kanye West crazy.

34:21.545 --> 34:23.881
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's just relax.

34:24.447 --> 34:25.983
All right?
This is just supposed to be fun.

34:26.050 --> 34:28.853
We have the youngest
Army of Love fan right here.

34:28.920 --> 34:30.755
So, let's all be cordial.

34:30.822 --> 34:31.956
He's 12.

34:32.123 --> 34:33.024
- Yeah.
- Really?

34:33.157 --> 34:34.324
It's gonna be
just like practice,

34:34.391 --> 34:36.426
except you're gonna have
the entire Army of Love

34:36.493 --> 34:38.361
backing you up.
Can you handle that?

34:38.695 --> 34:40.730
I know every Army of Love song.

34:41.364 --> 34:42.934
Hell,
I don't even know all of 'em.

34:43.134 --> 34:46.003
All right, little man.
What's your favorite song?

34:46.070 --> 34:47.271
"Blue Silver", I guess.

34:47.571 --> 34:48.773
"Blue Silver" it is.
Go get it.

34:48.840 --> 34:50.340
- "Blue Silver", yes.
- Yeah.

34:50.407 --> 34:52.276
- "Blue Silver", okay.
- Is this my chord?

34:52.342 --> 34:53.476
Yeah. Right there.

34:53.543 --> 34:54.711
- Cool.
- That's you.

35:01.185 --> 35:02.086
You good?

35:02.385 --> 35:04.856
One. One, two, three, four!

35:16.700 --> 35:19.837
Hey, come here. It's okay.
Let's try it again.

35:34.417 --> 35:38.990
<i>♪ Screwed up

35:41.058 --> 35:44.896

36:10.487 --> 36:12.189

out there, man.

36:12.489 --> 36:13.623
I told you he didn't suck!

36:13.925 --> 36:15.993
You know,
it felt like magic or something.

36:16.060 --> 36:18.396
I don't know. I'm gonna write
a song about it later.

36:18.495 --> 36:21.132
You write, too? Of... This kid.
Of course he writes.

36:21.731 --> 36:23.267
So, uh,
where are you from, mate?

36:23.334 --> 36:25.002
I was born in LA,
but my mom says

36:25.069 --> 36:26.771
I'm a child of Ocean Beach.

36:27.405 --> 36:28.973
Vaughn used to say
something like that.

36:30.074 --> 36:31.876
So, how long have you been
an Army of Love fan?

36:31.943 --> 36:33.878
I listened to "Blue Silver"
for the first time

36:33.945 --> 36:34.711
on Tuesday night.

36:35.079 --> 36:37.982
Uh, I thought you say
you listen to us all the time.

36:38.249 --> 36:40.051
- All the time since Tuesday.
- Okay.

36:40.483 --> 36:43.520
Oh, my God, you guys,
that was incredible.

36:43.821 --> 36:45.423
Don't get
your feelings hurt, kid.

36:45.488 --> 36:46.891
The dog hates everyone.

36:46.991 --> 36:48.458
Aww, he's so cute.

36:48.859 --> 36:51.162
- Well, he hates you.
- Animals like me.

36:51.429 --> 36:53.397
Emma says
it's 'cause I don't shower much.

36:53.596 --> 36:56.300
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Aw.

36:56.367 --> 36:58.169
So,
when are we doing this again?

36:58.235 --> 37:00.670
- This is a onetime done deal.
- Oh, come on.

37:00.737 --> 37:03.573
- Oh, well, think again.
- Yeah, Pedro. Think again, mate.

37:03.908 --> 37:06.410
I wanna do
an Army of Love concert

37:06.476 --> 37:07.445
at the Belly Up next month.

37:07.577 --> 37:08.545
Yes.

37:08.946 --> 37:10.747
Wait, wait, wait,
the Belly Up?

37:10.915 --> 37:12.482
That's where, like,
legit bands play.

37:12.549 --> 37:14.752
Well, we are legit.
And now you're one of us.

37:14.852 --> 37:16.287
If... if we are doing this,

37:16.387 --> 37:17.455
I'm gonna have to upgrade
my kit.

37:17.520 --> 37:18.588
Slow it down, guys.

37:18.789 --> 37:20.557
Come on, this kid's great
for his age, I get it.

37:20.623 --> 37:22.426
And next to Darby,
this dinosaur over here,

37:22.525 --> 37:23.626
it's just gonna be weird.
We can't...

37:26.097 --> 37:27.497
Yeah.

37:27.664 --> 37:30.301
Come on, you have to admit,
we killed that shit.

37:30.401 --> 37:32.436
Alex said "shit".

37:34.305 --> 37:35.272
All right. All right. Look,

37:35.339 --> 37:37.074
we practice for a few weeks,
all right?

37:37.174 --> 37:40.077
We... we do a small show
here first, get some PR.

37:40.144 --> 37:41.245
Come on. It's golden.

37:41.379 --> 37:42.512
That means
you're our new manager?

37:42.612 --> 37:44.448
- I'm in!
- Mm-hmm.

37:44.782 --> 37:47.318
Well, I mean...
I mean, got a lot on,

37:47.550 --> 37:49.453
so I'll probably fit you
in my schedule.

37:49.552 --> 37:50.988
You know,
my job really sucks

37:51.055 --> 37:52.589
and I really wanna play.

37:54.025 --> 37:54.759
I can't.

37:55.292 --> 37:56.927
- Oh, come on, come on. Look, tell me...
- Nope. Nope.

37:56.961 --> 37:59.163
...that this kid wouldn't love
to be a front man, huh?

38:00.998 --> 38:03.434
All right. He... he doesn't have
to be a 100 percent ready,

38:03.533 --> 38:05.169
but you will be the leader.

38:05.503 --> 38:07.271
Okay? You'd be taking on
all the guitar licks

38:07.338 --> 38:11.242
that he can't handle yet,
or vocals, and lead guitar.

38:11.342 --> 38:12.410
I'd be like a co-lead?

38:12.943 --> 38:14.744
We can't do this without you.

38:14.845 --> 38:17.948
You are the most
important member of this band

38:18.049 --> 38:21.752
and you're the only one
who could get him ready in time.

38:22.353 --> 38:23.454
He's gonna say yes.

38:23.553 --> 38:25.588
- I'm not saying yes.
- He's totally saying yes.

38:25.688 --> 38:27.425
- No.
- It's the face of a yes man.

38:27.557 --> 38:28.725
- Come on, say yes.
- No. I'm...

38:28.793 --> 38:29.994
Come on, mate.

38:30.795 --> 38:32.430
Now, do you know
what this thing is?

38:32.695 --> 38:35.433
Okay.
Um, I've seen them before.

38:35.533 --> 38:36.599
It's a metronome.
All right?

38:36.666 --> 38:38.469
It's gonna be your...
your best friend,

38:38.601 --> 38:40.337
and your worst enemy.

38:40.471 --> 38:41.671
- Okay.
- So we're gonna take it

38:41.738 --> 38:43.407
very slow,
keep a really slow beat,

38:43.474 --> 38:44.875
but you're gonna learn
every lick

38:45.042 --> 38:47.144
from every
Army of Love song ever.

38:47.278 --> 38:48.045
But at half speed.

38:48.145 --> 38:49.712
It's gonna be annoying
but I promise

38:49.814 --> 38:51.348
it'll make you
a better guitar player.

38:51.482 --> 38:52.715
- Now, put your guitar away.
- Wait.

38:52.883 --> 38:54.518
how am I supposed to learn
how to play guitar

38:54.584 --> 38:56.120
- without a guitar?
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

38:56.187 --> 38:58.022
No questions, okay?
Do you trust me?

38:58.089 --> 38:59.790
- Not really.
- Let's just focus.

38:59.957 --> 39:01.258
- Put it away.
- Okay.

39:01.859 --> 39:05.296
Most guitar players out there,
they're lazy, they're selfish.

39:05.563 --> 39:06.797
They don't wanna put in
the work.

39:07.231 --> 39:09.233
All they wanna do is look cool
and get laid.

39:09.599 --> 39:10.901
What's getting laid?

39:11.836 --> 39:14.338
Let's just pretend
I never said that, okay?

39:14.572 --> 39:16.673
- Okay.
- All right. Moving on.

39:43.868 --> 39:48.339
<i>♪ She was born
They let her go ♪</i>

39:50.574 --> 39:55.179
<i>♪ Said they couldn't raise

39:57.647 --> 40:02.286
<i>♪ When she goes out

40:04.255 --> 40:09.059

40:29.446 --> 40:32.416
- So progress is good, yeah?
- I mean he's getting better.

40:32.583 --> 40:34.185
It's just
we're not gonna be ready.

40:34.285 --> 40:35.753
Well, I've already started
the hype machine

40:35.819 --> 40:37.087
so we have to be.

40:37.354 --> 40:39.823
God, this is our path.
I see it so clearly.

40:39.924 --> 40:41.724
Girl, have you lost your meds?

40:45.829 --> 40:47.331
I was... I was just joking.

40:47.398 --> 40:48.899
I didn't know
that you were on...

40:49.033 --> 40:50.467
Are you... are you...
are you taking medication?

40:50.568 --> 40:52.136
Taken them all
at one point or another.

40:52.236 --> 40:54.405
Lexapro, Celexa, Zoloft,

40:54.471 --> 40:55.973
Prozac, I threw them out now.

40:56.040 --> 40:59.210
You, uh, you talk
to your therapist about that?

40:59.310 --> 41:00.644
- Therapist?
- Well, I don't know.

41:00.778 --> 41:02.913
I haven't had health insurance
in like two years.

41:03.047 --> 41:04.348
- Okay.
- Anyway, what can we do

41:04.415 --> 41:05.316
to get more ready?

41:05.715 --> 41:07.651
Well, we need more practice
for sure.

41:07.751 --> 41:10.421
It's just every time
we start practicing with Oak

41:10.487 --> 41:12.856
and his mom calls
and he needs to be home ASAP.

41:12.923 --> 41:14.592
- So...
- Okay. Well, we can fix that.

41:14.825 --> 41:16.794
Hey, I am...

41:17.294 --> 41:19.530
I really am seeing things
more clearly now.

41:19.897 --> 41:21.265
Much more clearly.

41:23.767 --> 41:27.171
Mm! Ooh! Oh.
That's not a good sign.

41:27.304 --> 41:28.806
- Wha... what? What's not a good sign?
- Ah.

41:28.906 --> 41:30.740
Yeah, you always go
for the wounded bird

41:30.808 --> 41:32.776
type of girls.
Let's see, daddy issues,

41:32.843 --> 41:35.613
eating disorders, cosplayers.
I remember them all.

41:35.846 --> 41:37.381
I mean, hell,
I was an addict when we dated.

41:37.448 --> 41:40.417
No, you were addicted
to obsessing over your brother.

41:43.320 --> 41:44.521
I'm sorry I said that.

41:44.888 --> 41:46.190
You know,
I know that's how you see it,

41:46.257 --> 41:48.259
but I was Vaughn's
only family and...

41:48.826 --> 41:50.327
But we're all family.

41:51.729 --> 41:52.896
We all hurt.

41:54.131 --> 41:55.099
Still hurt.

41:57.034 --> 41:57.968
Yeah.

41:58.769 --> 42:00.337
I'm still in love with you.

42:01.472 --> 42:03.440
I miss you. Huh?

42:03.807 --> 42:05.843
- I miss kissing you.
- Oh!

42:05.909 --> 42:07.578
Okay. Slow down, slow down.

42:07.778 --> 42:09.179
You're so cheesy.

42:09.446 --> 42:11.482
Look, why don't we just focus
on getting Oak ready

42:11.548 --> 42:13.884
and then
we'll see about kissing?

42:16.820 --> 42:18.422
- You didn't say no.
- Are you coming?

42:18.489 --> 42:20.024
Yeah.

42:21.025 --> 42:22.493
<i>Oh, I know. I have heard</i>

42:22.893 --> 42:25.262
all about you people
and your "Enemy of Love".

42:25.396 --> 42:27.197
Army of Love, Mom.
I keep telling you.

42:27.264 --> 42:29.400
You know what I meant.
Come here, baby.

42:30.868 --> 42:32.303
I just want you
around here more.

42:32.369 --> 42:33.871
I don't want you hanging out
with a bunch

42:33.937 --> 42:35.372
of druggie musicians
all the time.

42:35.439 --> 42:36.840
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

42:37.441 --> 42:39.910
I... I can assure you
none of the band members

42:39.977 --> 42:41.378
are... are druggies.

42:41.478 --> 42:43.213
Yeah. No. Gambling.

42:43.447 --> 42:45.282
Light alcoholism at best.

42:45.549 --> 42:47.251
Oak's father was an alcoholic.

42:49.153 --> 42:50.821
That's how I got my scar.

42:52.256 --> 42:53.223
I'm sorry.

42:53.691 --> 42:55.025
That and I'm...
I'm sorry for Gina.

42:55.092 --> 42:56.293
- She's really bad at telling jokes.
- Yeah.

42:56.360 --> 42:58.028
I'm not good at jokes.
Sorry. And...

42:58.095 --> 42:59.830
How much more time
would Oak had to be away?

43:00.531 --> 43:03.802
Well, um, he'll usually be done
right around dinner time.

43:03.867 --> 43:04.935
Or we could feed him.

43:05.102 --> 43:06.236
- Yeah.
- We could totally feed him. It's...

43:06.337 --> 43:09.006
Excuse me?
Are you saying that I can't?

43:09.406 --> 43:11.508
No. No.
That's not what I said.

43:11.575 --> 43:13.944
- I just... I...
- No. Do not belittle me

43:14.044 --> 43:15.279
in front of my son.

43:15.346 --> 43:17.681
I served
on the U.S.S. Carl Vinson.

43:17.748 --> 43:19.516
Just because
I am in between jobs,

43:19.616 --> 43:20.984
does not mean
that you are better

43:21.085 --> 43:23.620
- than me, lady.
- Hey, hey, hey. That's not what she's saying.

43:23.687 --> 43:25.222
- Oak has a gift.
- Yeah, yeah.

43:25.322 --> 43:26.924
Something
that you people wanna exploit.

43:26.990 --> 43:28.625
I'm sorry,
these people need to leave.

43:28.692 --> 43:29.593
They need to go.

43:29.761 --> 43:31.095
- Mom, stop it.
- You know what? I...

43:31.528 --> 43:33.397
We are not trying
to take him from you, okay?

43:33.464 --> 43:35.834
We just need a little bit more
of his time, that's all.

43:35.899 --> 43:37.301
Mom, I really want to.

43:39.771 --> 43:41.773
Really want to do it, please...

43:41.905 --> 43:43.040
Hey, Oak.

43:44.141 --> 43:45.810
Oak, is this...
is this your notebook?

43:45.976 --> 43:47.044
Yeah. I wrote my songs.

43:47.144 --> 43:48.645
So you drew this?
You drew this monkey?

43:48.712 --> 43:50.280
Yeah,
I have a lot of those things.

43:50.614 --> 43:51.582
Can you show me?

43:54.318 --> 43:56.855
- Oak has a shot at being great.
- This is your journal?

43:56.920 --> 43:58.088
- Okay? Maybe better than Vaughn...
- Yeah.

43:58.555 --> 44:00.190
- And you drew this? This monkey?
- ...definitely better than me.

44:00.290 --> 44:03.026
- Mm-hmm.
- He just needs some guidance.

44:04.728 --> 44:05.830
- Okay?
- I like that.

44:05.896 --> 44:07.464
- Thanks.
- This one, too.

44:07.931 --> 44:09.834
It's like a panda.
You drew that?

44:09.900 --> 44:12.102
Yeah, I don't know
why I always draw that.

44:15.807 --> 44:16.740
Right here?

44:17.040 --> 44:18.375
Yeah. This, too?

44:18.475 --> 44:19.476
Yeah.

44:24.148 --> 44:25.649
You really miss him, don't you?

44:27.351 --> 44:28.285
Every day.

44:31.155 --> 44:32.791
How much are you guys
gonna pay him?

44:32.990 --> 44:35.659
Well, if this works,
then I want Oak

44:35.726 --> 44:36.761
to get his fair share.

44:37.060 --> 44:38.830
I don't know what that means,
so, um...

44:38.897 --> 44:41.064
Mom, they already gave me
a 3,000 dollar guitar

44:41.165 --> 44:42.065
and free lessons.

44:42.332 --> 44:43.934
Sweetie, and that was
really nice of them,

44:44.001 --> 44:45.235
but they need to pay you
real money.

44:45.302 --> 44:47.938
Whatever Pedro makes,
that's what Oak makes.

44:48.472 --> 44:50.707
We're not really making
any money right now, so it...

44:50.775 --> 44:52.042
Oh, when you do.

44:52.844 --> 44:53.977
Deal.

44:54.411 --> 44:56.280
You have yourself a deal,
Gina Jackson.

45:00.317 --> 45:03.654
Great. Same contract
as a ten-year-old kid.

45:40.224 --> 45:42.159
- Oak.
- Hey, Emma.

45:42.927 --> 45:44.094
Woo.

45:45.930 --> 45:47.130
Yeah.

45:49.299 --> 45:50.200
Woo.

45:50.334 --> 45:51.401
Yeah!

45:56.507 --> 45:58.008
Um, I haven't seen you lately.

45:58.542 --> 46:00.277
I've been practicing nonstop.

46:00.444 --> 46:02.446
Gina says
I've got that star thing

46:02.513 --> 46:03.480
that Vaughn had.

46:05.382 --> 46:08.619
You know that Gina lady
used to have problems.

46:15.092 --> 46:16.928
<i>My dad said

Well, but I'm alive again.

What's it been, like,
seven years?

47:58.029 --> 47:59.964
Ten, almost exactly ten.

48:00.031 --> 48:02.967
Last time I saw you,
we were drinking

48:03.034 --> 48:04.601
50 cent margaritas in TJ.

48:04.668 --> 48:07.170
Oh, man.
Those nights never ended well.

48:07.270 --> 48:08.271
Speak for yourself.

48:08.505 --> 48:11.274
That's where I learned
my best drunken Spanish.

48:11.341 --> 48:13.945
Yeah.

48:14.177 --> 48:16.781
So, what do I owe this honor?

48:17.581 --> 48:18.515
Well...

48:19.017 --> 48:20.450
Hey, Army of Love tonight.

48:20.584 --> 48:22.686
Next big thing,
you're gonna wanna be there.

48:23.087 --> 48:25.389
Hey, what's up, ladies?

48:26.657 --> 48:28.325
Army of Love tonight.

48:28.492 --> 48:30.527
I'll see... Okay.
All right. That's all right.

48:30.594 --> 48:32.362
Free show tonight,
Army of Love.

48:38.702 --> 48:40.504
Mom. Mom.

48:40.972 --> 48:43.440
Honey, what are you doing here?
I thought you were at rehearsal?

48:43.540 --> 48:44.942
I can't find
my guitar anywhere.

48:45.009 --> 48:46.176
Have you seen it?

48:46.710 --> 48:47.812
No. Um...

48:48.578 --> 48:49.914
No, have...
have you checked your school?

48:50.014 --> 48:51.015
Maybe you left it at school.

48:51.149 --> 48:52.749
The show is tonight.
What am I gonna do?

48:53.617 --> 48:54.584
Well, I...

48:55.086 --> 48:56.754
I think that you
are gonna find it

48:56.821 --> 48:59.623
before the show and...
and everything is gonna be fine.

48:59.690 --> 49:02.060
Your show is gonna be...
Oh, my bus is coming. I...

49:02.392 --> 49:03.427
You will find your guitar.

49:03.493 --> 49:04.996
You're gonna have it
for tonight, okay?

49:05.063 --> 49:06.296
I just have this feeling.

49:06.363 --> 49:07.731
I'll be there tonight,
I promise.

49:07.832 --> 49:10.300
It's at eight o'clock.
You're coming, right?

49:11.201 --> 49:13.737
I would never miss your show.
I'm gonna be there.

49:14.005 --> 49:16.007
But I have to go.
I love you, okay?

49:16.107 --> 49:17.207
Bye, baby.

49:19.342 --> 49:20.577
Come on.

49:23.981 --> 49:24.982
Love you, Mom.

49:37.227 --> 49:38.896
Here you go.

49:40.932 --> 49:42.599
Jean Jacket okayed this?

49:42.733 --> 49:43.467
Not yet. Why?

49:43.633 --> 49:46.137
I mean
it's a little Pedro-centric, no?

49:48.238 --> 49:50.707
- Hey, showtime. You guys ready?
- Jean!

49:50.808 --> 49:52.542
You seem rather chipper
this morning.

49:52.642 --> 49:54.745
Well, that's 'cause I've got
something super cool

49:54.812 --> 49:56.713
to show you guys.
Come check this out.

49:57.647 --> 49:58.749
What you got?

49:58.816 --> 50:00.918
Are you guys ready
to have your minds blown?

50:01.119 --> 50:02.220
All right. So this...

50:02.385 --> 50:04.188
this is Vaughn's
old music journal.

50:04.254 --> 50:05.355
He doodled more than he wrote.

50:05.455 --> 50:06.991
Yeah.
Well, check this out.

50:08.391 --> 50:09.326
I don't get it.

50:09.493 --> 50:12.029
This is not Vaughn's doodle.
This is Oak's.

50:12.662 --> 50:14.065
And he's got plenty more
just like this.

50:14.132 --> 50:15.900
You know,
just like Vaughn's, look.

50:16.566 --> 50:18.770
- You see?
- Okay. It's similar, I guess.

50:18.903 --> 50:19.804
I knew it.

50:20.138 --> 50:21.738
I knew it
the moment that I saw him.

50:21.806 --> 50:23.306
I didn't wanna say anything
until I had proof.

50:23.406 --> 50:24.641
- And now there's proof.
- Proof of what?

50:24.876 --> 50:27.410
That Oak
is the reincarnation of Vaughn.

50:27.477 --> 50:29.914
Ooh.

50:30.680 --> 50:33.383
- You're messing with us, right?
- She's dead serious, I'm afraid.

50:33.450 --> 50:35.452
You guys, it's obvious.

50:35.552 --> 50:37.955
I mean, he plays like Vaughn.
He talks like Vaughn.

50:38.022 --> 50:39.489
He's absorbed Army's music

50:39.556 --> 50:41.993
like it was already
inhabiting his soul. I mean...

50:42.093 --> 50:43.261
What about Larry, right?

50:43.326 --> 50:45.562
Larry hates everyone
but not Oak.

50:45.695 --> 50:47.631
Come on, he scooters, he surfs.

50:47.697 --> 50:49.867
- And now this.
- Every kid in San Diego scooters and surfs.

50:49.967 --> 50:53.403
I mean, throw a frisbee down
on Newport and you will hit one.

50:53.470 --> 50:55.438
Yeah, this is a sketch
of the Chim Chim

50:55.505 --> 50:57.674
from <i>Speed Racer.</i>
Vaughn loved that stupid show.

50:57.809 --> 51:00.044
All right. But how would
a ten-year-old know that show?

51:00.144 --> 51:02.579
Uh, YouTube?
I don't know. Uh...

51:02.847 --> 51:04.581
I don't care how he got
this image in his head,

51:04.714 --> 51:06.683
it's just a picture.
It's not proof of anything.

51:06.884 --> 51:08.618
I mean,
he does have Vaughn's talent.

51:09.619 --> 51:11.721
But reincarnation,
I mean, that... that...

51:11.956 --> 51:13.291
it's a bit out there, innit?

51:13.390 --> 51:15.325
Over half the world
believes in reincarnation,

51:15.425 --> 51:17.261
- including D.B. Tell them.
- No, don't...

51:17.327 --> 51:19.263
No, don't put this on me.
Look, I told you

51:19.362 --> 51:20.865
a personal story
about my father.

51:20.965 --> 51:22.432
You took it the wrong way.

51:26.436 --> 51:28.072
God, you guys won't even
acknowledge this?

51:28.139 --> 51:29.439
Hey, look,
the first time you saw Oak,

51:29.506 --> 51:31.142
he was playing
Vaughn's old Taylor,

51:31.209 --> 51:32.276
singing his song.

51:32.542 --> 51:33.811
I'm sure
that must've been traumatic.

51:33.911 --> 51:37.114
No. Oak is the reincarnation
of Vaughn

51:37.181 --> 51:38.448
and this is our fate.

51:38.515 --> 51:40.517
Dammit, Gina.
Uh, you know what?

51:40.584 --> 51:42.019
I knew something was wrong

51:42.086 --> 51:43.653
when you started
getting all manic.

51:43.720 --> 51:44.789
Oh, manic?

51:44.856 --> 51:45.823
Come here.

51:46.556 --> 51:48.391
Are you taking any pills?

51:48.458 --> 51:50.560
No.
And screw you for asking me.

51:51.996 --> 51:55.032
Is this why you have us practice
until our fingers bleed,

51:55.099 --> 51:56.566
for your sad delusions?

51:56.666 --> 51:58.501
You know, I've been
losing shifts for this.

51:58.903 --> 52:00.004
I'm losing money.

52:00.104 --> 52:01.873
You still remember
what a coincidence is, right?

52:01.973 --> 52:02.672
Yeah, I do.

52:03.107 --> 52:05.508
Like the coincidence that D.B.
gave away Vaughn's guitar?

52:05.609 --> 52:07.644
His 3,000 dollar guitar
in the exact day

52:07.744 --> 52:09.412
that I needed 3,000 dollars?

52:09.479 --> 52:11.414
Oh, like, the coincidence
that both, Oak, and Vaughn

52:11.481 --> 52:13.284
point with their devil horns?
I mean, come on.

52:13.351 --> 52:14.684
Or like the coincidence

52:14.752 --> 52:16.754
of when you're vacationing
in Jamaica

52:16.888 --> 52:18.856
and you make out
with the most gorgeous bird

52:18.923 --> 52:19.790
in the entire resort

52:19.957 --> 52:22.459
only to find out
that she's your second cousin.

52:22.559 --> 52:23.560
- Oh, all right. Enough.
- Shut up.

52:23.727 --> 52:25.997
- All right, you guys.
- I think I... I can speak

52:26.063 --> 52:27.298
for all of us when I say

52:27.365 --> 52:29.367
that we are worried
about your state of mind.

52:29.432 --> 52:30.968
- Thank you for that.
- And, how about Oak?

52:31.068 --> 52:33.703
You ever thought about what this
might actually do to him?

52:33.771 --> 52:35.940
Are you kidding me?
That's all I think about.

52:36.406 --> 52:39.576
You saw what a disaster
his mom is. He needs me.

52:39.844 --> 52:40.543
He needs us.

52:40.677 --> 52:41.946
What about me?

52:44.882 --> 52:46.616
Oak, mate. Um...

52:47.318 --> 52:48.485
What's wrong?

52:48.986 --> 52:50.254
I can't find my guitar.

52:50.654 --> 52:51.721
I looked everywhere.

52:52.156 --> 52:55.192
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay. I'll help you find it, okay?

52:55.659 --> 52:56.593
Okay.

52:58.963 --> 52:59.864
Come here.

53:01.365 --> 53:02.499
If that kid really is Vaughn,

53:02.599 --> 53:03.834
looks like he gonna get
in the way

53:03.901 --> 53:05.937
of y'all's relationship
all over again.

53:06.137 --> 53:07.305
Uh-hmm.
- Sh... shut up.

53:07.470 --> 53:09.206
It was right there,
I know it was.

53:09.273 --> 53:11.108
It's okay.
And you looked all around?

53:11.375 --> 53:13.177
- Yup. Yeah.
- Okay.

53:18.515 --> 53:20.650
Hey, Oak? Is this your father?

53:21.185 --> 53:22.153
Yeah.

53:22.552 --> 53:24.055
He died before I was born.

53:24.956 --> 53:26.057
I know that's hard.

53:27.590 --> 53:29.126
Vaughn and I lost
both of our parents

53:29.193 --> 53:31.461
when we were really young.
And then after that, it was...

53:31.528 --> 53:33.798
...foster family
after foster family.

53:34.899 --> 53:38.369
I remember
our worst foster father.

53:39.203 --> 53:41.738
Whenever Vaughn would sing
or play his drum kit,

53:41.806 --> 53:44.008
he'd always say
in this smoky cigar voice,

53:44.108 --> 53:46.143
you know, "Little kids
are meant to be seen,

53:46.210 --> 53:47.211
not heard."

53:49.013 --> 53:52.083
He was awful.
We ran away after two months.

53:53.117 --> 53:55.286
But you got to meet
your real dad. I mean,

53:55.585 --> 53:57.221
before you got the awful dads.

53:57.888 --> 53:58.789
Yeah.

53:59.223 --> 54:00.825
I never got to meet mine.

54:05.628 --> 54:07.231
It's not here. I told you.

54:07.365 --> 54:08.565
Okay. Hey.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.203
I will find you another guitar
for tonight, okay?

54:12.269 --> 54:14.537
And then after, I'll help you
track down the Taylor.

54:14.604 --> 54:16.173
It's what managers do.

54:16.440 --> 54:17.808
Kinda like a mom, huh?

54:18.309 --> 54:20.111
Yeah. A lot like a mom.

54:21.312 --> 54:22.612
You think I'm Vaughn.

54:24.482 --> 54:26.616
That's what you were talking
about with the band.

54:29.320 --> 54:30.587
If it turns out...

54:31.489 --> 54:32.790
I'm just Oak...

54:35.725 --> 54:37.161
can I still be in the band?

54:37.361 --> 54:41.265
Are you kidding me?
Hey.

54:42.033 --> 54:42.933
Look, no matter what,

54:43.000 --> 54:45.269
you were meant
to be a part of this family.

54:46.070 --> 54:47.071
I promise.

54:47.704 --> 54:49.639
Okay?

54:49.874 --> 54:53.911
But, uh, you got anything else
to wear for the stage tonight?

54:53.978 --> 54:59.050
I got some clean gym shorts,
and a dope yellow turtleneck.

54:59.150 --> 55:02.086
Oh, a dope yellow turtleneck.

55:02.153 --> 55:03.087
You wanna see it?

55:03.553 --> 55:05.555
This mom
is gonna take you shopping.

55:33.150 --> 55:34.285
Next.

55:36.153 --> 55:37.254
Remove the hat, please?

55:37.955 --> 55:38.856
Oh, yes.

55:39.990 --> 55:41.425
What was the purpose
of your trip?

55:41.859 --> 55:44.328
Um, lunch.
I was visiting a friend.

55:44.661 --> 55:46.330
You buy anything
while you were in Mexico?

55:47.298 --> 55:48.631
No.

55:49.867 --> 55:51.936
Can I ask
to see your purse, please?

55:53.904 --> 55:54.905
Uh, yeah.

56:09.186 --> 56:10.087
What's this?

56:11.922 --> 56:12.823
Uh...

56:15.658 --> 56:16.794
<i>These are kind of expensive.</i>

56:16.894 --> 56:17.895
<i>Oh, don't worry about that.</i>

56:18.162 --> 56:21.365
I bet you have a birthday
coming up, am I right?

56:22.299 --> 56:23.434
In like four months.

56:23.934 --> 56:26.804
- Oh.
- You thought I have the same birthday as Vaughn?

56:27.771 --> 56:29.706
No. Actually,
I thought maybe your birth

56:29.807 --> 56:31.775
happened around the same time
he passed.

56:33.410 --> 56:36.013
Oh. Can I have
the clothes anyway?

56:36.247 --> 56:38.382
Of course you can, silly.

56:38.916 --> 56:41.752
Let's check these out.
Let's see what we got. Oh.

56:43.120 --> 56:43.888
Hendrix.

56:43.954 --> 56:45.356
You know who Jimi Hendrix is?

56:45.456 --> 56:48.492
He was left handed, self-taught,
and died too young.

56:48.725 --> 56:50.594
Yeah, that's good.

56:51.095 --> 56:52.662
Oh, okay. You... you're gonna...

56:52.729 --> 56:54.899
- you're gonna try it on right now?
- Too big?

56:56.033 --> 56:56.834
It's perfect.

56:57.101 --> 56:59.736
Hello, San Diego,
my name is Sheila Sundgard,

56:59.803 --> 57:01.738
and it's an honor to be a part
of this local music.

57:01.872 --> 57:03.440
We got a great lineup tonight.

57:03.641 --> 57:05.776
This next song
is "Spoke Too Loud".

57:14.351 --> 57:19.990
<i>♪ Cool to talk
But I like to shout and yell ♪</i>

57:20.191 --> 57:21.292
Where is she?

57:23.693 --> 57:26.263
Pedro, chill. She'll make it.

57:26.597 --> 57:28.465
- Relax, man.
- Hey, you guys. You ready?

57:29.633 --> 57:30.801
Really?

57:31.435 --> 57:32.503
He liked it.

57:33.070 --> 57:35.239
- What's up, buddy?
- Are you drunk?

57:35.339 --> 57:37.141
- Of course I am, Oak.
- Darb?

57:37.241 --> 57:39.076
- Just a little bit.
- So many people are here to see you.

57:39.143 --> 57:40.344
- I will kill you.
- I've had, like, four.

57:40.411 --> 57:42.379
- Go check it out.
- I'm here, aren't I?

57:42.446 --> 57:43.547
Yes.

57:43.781 --> 57:46.150
<i>♪ Make your move ♪</i>

57:46.917 --> 57:50.588
<i>♪ Honey, prove you'll be mine ♪</i>

57:52.022 --> 57:53.324
I know what you're thinking.

57:53.390 --> 57:55.725
This ain't gonna be the same
without Vaughn Jackson.

57:55.826 --> 57:57.428
But they got
a killer replacement.

57:57.795 --> 58:00.030
And I'm kind of
a unofficial member of the band,

58:00.097 --> 58:02.566
you know, the surrogate father,
more like a manager really.

58:03.901 --> 58:05.735
I'll shut up
and pour you that beer.

58:06.437 --> 58:08.038
All right, you guys.
Hey, let's huddle up.

58:08.305 --> 58:09.773
Yeah.

58:10.507 --> 58:13.344
Hi. I know that this has been
a strange journey for us,

58:13.410 --> 58:15.212
but let's embrace the crazy,

58:15.546 --> 58:16.780
honor the rebirth
of Army of Love,

58:16.880 --> 58:18.249
and have a great damn show.

58:18.415 --> 58:20.017
- Amen.
- Amen.

58:20.251 --> 58:21.185
Amen.

58:22.820 --> 58:24.088
Dude, what are you doing here?

58:24.822 --> 58:26.156
Good show guys.

58:26.290 --> 58:28.726
Have a good show.
Whoo, let's go. Yeah.

58:28.792 --> 58:31.562
Okay. All right.
AOL, come on in, guys.

58:31.662 --> 58:34.465
All right. One, two, three.

58:34.698 --> 58:35.833
AOL!

58:39.403 --> 58:40.604
Oh, all right.

58:41.005 --> 58:43.073
We got any Army of Love fans
in the house?

58:43.140 --> 58:44.375
Yeah.

58:46.577 --> 58:47.745
I'm gonna bring them up soon,

58:48.045 --> 58:50.047
but just for now,
can you do something for me?

58:50.114 --> 58:52.650
I just want you guys to close
your eyes for a second.

58:53.017 --> 58:56.553
It's been awhile, so I want you
to imagine that Vaughn Jackson

58:56.620 --> 58:58.289
is here singing to you guys.

58:59.156 --> 59:01.825
Now, I want you to transform
him in your mind.

59:03.027 --> 59:04.995
What if Vaughn had a son?

59:06.830 --> 59:09.466
Uh. Just spiritually.
A... a spiritual son.

59:09.867 --> 59:11.935
What would the next generation
of Vaughn look like?

59:12.469 --> 59:14.338
Because that's who we've got
here tonight.

59:14.438 --> 59:18.475
So, give it up for Army of Love
and the Mighty Oak Scoggins.

59:18.542 --> 59:22.913
Yay! Army of Love! Whoo!

59:27.117 --> 59:29.286
- That's my band.
- Whoo!

59:30.721 --> 59:31.989
Let's go, Oak.

59:32.523 --> 59:33.891
Army of Love.

59:34.958 --> 59:36.093
Whoa.

59:38.929 --> 59:40.898
Hey, Pedro,

59:47.806 --> 59:48.773

1:02:10.782 --> 1:02:13.684
Hey. Hey, you were so good.

1:02:14.284 --> 1:02:15.219

1:02:18.155 --> 1:02:19.389
She never came.

1:02:20.190 --> 1:02:22.226
I know, sweetie. I get it.
But I have it on video.

1:02:22.326 --> 1:02:23.260
And I'll upload it for you

1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:24.628
so you can show her tonight,
okay?

1:02:25.797 --> 1:02:26.697
Okay.

1:02:26.997 --> 1:02:28.265
And there's somebody
that I want you to meet.

1:02:28.365 --> 1:02:29.399
Okay.

1:02:31.134 --> 1:02:33.003
Oak,
I want you to meet someone.

1:02:33.070 --> 1:02:34.104
This is Taylor Lazlo.

1:02:34.371 --> 1:02:36.440
She's the music critic
for the <i>San Diego Reader.</i>

1:02:36.507 --> 1:02:38.041
Hi. I'm Oak.

1:02:38.208 --> 1:02:39.543
Really nice to meet you, too.

1:02:39.710 --> 1:02:42.646
Really impressive.
Gina was not overselling.

1:02:42.713 --> 1:02:44.916
You are a monster talent.

1:02:45.015 --> 1:02:46.216
Thanks.

1:02:46.450 --> 1:02:49.720
I see you met Oak.
I've been, uh, training him.

1:02:50.621 --> 1:02:51.823
- Pedro...
- Mm.

1:02:52.189 --> 1:02:53.758
aren't you looking fine as hell?

1:02:55.793 --> 1:02:57.594
Thanks. You, too. Uh, no.

1:02:57.762 --> 1:03:00.564
No, that's... that's not
what I meant. Not you, too. I...

1:03:00.631 --> 1:03:02.934
I see you're still thirsty
for Gina?

1:03:03.133 --> 1:03:04.268
No. No. No, no,

1:03:04.401 --> 1:03:06.004
I'm not really thirsty
for anybody at the moment.

1:03:06.069 --> 1:03:07.304
So I'm just...

1:03:08.472 --> 1:03:09.172
Sure you're not.

1:03:09.774 --> 1:03:12.911
Looks like you found a talent
to hook up your wagon.

1:03:13.011 --> 1:03:14.244
Oh, wow.

1:03:15.312 --> 1:03:16.915

after all these years.

1:03:16.981 --> 1:03:18.615
Oh, yes.
I will show you ball-busting,

Listen here...

1:03:21.019 --> 1:03:22.954
- All right. All right. Okay. Okay.
- There's the Mighty Oak.

1:03:23.021 --> 1:03:24.454
Congratulations.

1:03:24.956 --> 1:03:26.423
- Hey!
- Got any shots?

1:03:26.657 --> 1:03:27.658
What?

1:03:29.192 --> 1:03:30.795
Espresso.

1:03:30.929 --> 1:03:32.729
- Let's party!
- Okay.

1:03:32.897 --> 1:03:33.932
- Oh.
- Woo!

1:03:34.164 --> 1:03:36.099
Thanks for driving.
The last thing I need is a DUI.

1:03:36.166 --> 1:03:37.568
Yeah. No worries.

1:03:37.969 --> 1:03:40.137
You have to admit,
that was a great show.

1:03:41.005 --> 1:03:43.073
Yeah.
I mean, the audience loved it.

1:03:44.474 --> 1:03:45.242
So, uh...

1:03:45.777 --> 1:03:48.545
when we get back to my place,
you wanna come inside?

1:03:48.913 --> 1:03:50.080

when he left us.

I thought that you've finally

but I guess...
I guess I was wrong

1:06:57.300 --> 1:06:59.070

it's all just happening again.

- No, it's different this time.
- It's different?

1:07:01.939 --> 1:07:03.207
Just like the time that you, uh,

1:07:03.507 --> 1:07:04.842
claimed
that you saw Vaughn's ghost.

1:07:05.209 --> 1:07:06.376
Remember that?

1:07:07.410 --> 1:07:09.379
Let me tell you something.
I'm not doing this again.

1:07:10.148 --> 1:07:11.082
Okay?

1:07:11.916 --> 1:07:13.683
Oh, let me guess, it's different

1:07:13.785 --> 1:07:15.887
I had to call
a 5150 hold on you,

1:07:15.987 --> 1:07:16.821
right? 'Cause you were thinking

1:07:16.888 --> 1:07:18.522
that you were gonna join
Vaughn in heaven.

1:07:18.622 --> 1:07:20.825
I was depressed then, okay?
I'm not anymore.

1:07:23.828 --> 1:07:25.196
All of this, this.

1:07:25.830 --> 1:07:27.765
So, what? So, some kid
just comes into our life

1:07:27.865 --> 1:07:29.566

he really is the reincarnation

1:07:29.633 --> 1:07:32.170

What if we were all
meant to be together?

1:07:44.714 --> 1:07:47.285
You, me, Vaughn, the band
just in a different way

1:07:47.350 --> 1:07:48.552
and a different time?

1:07:48.685 --> 1:07:50.288
I mean, can you at least
be open to that?

1:07:50.353 --> 1:07:51.721

1:07:51.923 --> 1:07:52.890

me and you,

1:08:00.832 --> 1:08:02.332

this time.

1:09:27.318 --> 1:09:28.685
You stole Oak's guitar,
didn't you?

1:09:28.753 --> 1:09:30.788
To buy drugs or whatever it is
that got you arrested.

1:09:30.888 --> 1:09:32.656
You have no idea
what you're talking about,

1:09:32.722 --> 1:09:35.259
- so you need to back off, lady.
- Yeah? Really?

1:09:35.326 --> 1:09:36.726
All he wanted
was to see you there.

1:09:36.794 --> 1:09:38.195
That's all he wanted
and you couldn't even do that.

1:09:38.262 --> 1:09:39.864
- Chill. Chill. Chill. Chill.
- Yes, Oak's better than you!

1:09:39.931 --> 1:09:41.598
I'm not gonna chill!
Look at me.

1:09:41.698 --> 1:09:43.700
Just because life sucks
does not mean

1:09:43.801 --> 1:09:45.036
that Vaughn has to suffer.

1:09:45.735 --> 1:09:46.636
Vaughn?

1:09:48.505 --> 1:09:49.840
Oak. I meant Oak.

1:09:50.473 --> 1:09:53.610
Yeah. Gina,
you just made it weird again.

1:09:59.183 --> 1:10:01.018
I'm really, really sorry.

1:10:01.718 --> 1:10:03.988
That is never
gonna happen again, okay?

1:10:05.256 --> 1:10:06.456
Do you wanna see it?

1:10:07.358 --> 1:10:08.658
I can watch it?

1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:10.328
Thank you.

1:10:10.428 --> 1:10:12.797
Do you want me to pull it up?

1:10:12.930 --> 1:10:15.632
Yeah. Heck, yeah,
I wanna watch it.

1:10:18.169 --> 1:10:19.003
There.

1:10:19.337 --> 1:10:21.072
- There.
- <i>One, two, three four...</i>

1:10:21.671 --> 1:10:23.506
- Can you put that on the table?
- Yeah.

1:10:23.874 --> 1:10:26.210

Hi, everybody.
I wrote this song,

1:11:49.827 --> 1:11:51.929

"So, not since Brian Johnson
replaced Bon Scott in AC/DC

1:12:29.266 --> 1:12:33.003
has there been a more obvious
reincarnation of a band leader,"

1:12:33.104 --> 1:12:35.439
says Army of Love manager,
Gina Jackson.

1:12:35.506 --> 1:12:36.774
"Band leader," really?

1:12:37.274 --> 1:12:38.608
Get over it. Come on.

1:12:40.244 --> 1:12:41.445
"But while Johnson

1:12:41.545 --> 1:12:44.647
only reincarnated the voice,
he's so perfectly emulated,

1:12:44.714 --> 1:12:46.517
Jackson insists
that Army of Love's

1:12:46.584 --> 1:12:48.018
new front man,

1:12:48.319 --> 1:12:49.253
ten-year-old, Oak Scoggins

1:12:49.487 --> 1:12:52.156
really is the reincarnation
of the late Vaughn Jackson

1:12:52.223 --> 1:12:55.493
who died tragically
in a car accident a decade ago.

1:12:55.926 --> 1:12:57.828
- Come on, keep reading.
- No. I don't think I want to.

1:12:58.028 --> 1:12:59.729
All right.
Well, Taylor loved the show

1:12:59.797 --> 1:13:03.033
and the video is already
at 40,000 views, last I checked.

1:13:03.134 --> 1:13:05.269
I mean, it's working.
It's called marketing.

1:13:05.369 --> 1:13:07.338
No. You see?
This is what I'm talking about.

1:13:07.404 --> 1:13:08.539
You're trying to force it.

1:13:08.738 --> 1:13:09.874
It has nothing to do
with marketing

1:13:09.940 --> 1:13:11.542
and has everything to do
with Oak.

1:13:11.609 --> 1:13:12.610
All right. You know what?

1:13:12.910 --> 1:13:14.211
Don't let me convince you,
just let fate do that.

1:13:14.278 --> 1:13:16.746
You guys, this video
is not really going viral.

1:13:16.881 --> 1:13:19.617
Is it, Gina? She bought what,
50,000 views for 25 bucks,

1:13:19.716 --> 1:13:20.885
- was that it?
- How did you know that?

1:13:21.185 --> 1:13:22.887
Well, you know, Vaughn's,
uh, shrine wasn't the only thing

1:13:22.987 --> 1:13:25.022
that I was checking out
Sunday morning.

1:13:25.289 --> 1:13:27.091
Yeah, you know, you should
probably password-protect

1:13:27.158 --> 1:13:29.126
your Mac if you insist
on lying to us.

1:13:29.260 --> 1:13:32.563
Honey, you shouldn't be
lying to us, we are your family.

1:13:32.695 --> 1:13:35.599
Hey, lie to boys.
That's what they're there for.

1:13:35.732 --> 1:13:37.935
Wait. So,
we're not really going viral?

1:13:38.035 --> 1:13:39.702
Okay. So, I messed
with the numbers a little bit,

1:13:39.803 --> 1:13:42.439
- big deal, it's working.
- Oh, enough! Okay?

1:13:42.506 --> 1:13:44.074
You lied about the video views,

1:13:44.141 --> 1:13:45.876
you were wrong
about Oak's birthday,

1:13:45.943 --> 1:13:47.545
and now you're berating
his mother around

1:13:47.645 --> 1:13:49.046
like she's some crazy maniac?

1:13:49.113 --> 1:13:51.081
- You know what?
- You're the one who's crazy.

1:13:51.148 --> 1:13:52.850
Is she coming back?
'Cause her shift starts in,

1:13:52.950 --> 1:13:54.985
- like, five minutes.
- Geez.

1:13:55.152 --> 1:13:57.087

another one of these.

He asked for my autograph.

- Hello.

1:15:50.734 --> 1:15:51.969
They just got in from Minnesota.

1:15:52.236 --> 1:15:54.438
I'm...
I'm so sorry for your loss.

1:15:54.571 --> 1:15:55.873
It's awfully nice to meet you.

1:15:55.973 --> 1:15:58.409
And thank you so much
for what you have done for Oak.

1:15:58.542 --> 1:16:02.646
Oh, and that Pedro fellow,
he's just as sweet as he can be.

1:16:02.713 --> 1:16:04.682
It's amazing
what the power of love

1:16:04.783 --> 1:16:05.916
and music can do.

1:16:06.350 --> 1:16:09.820
Oak is a very special young man.
Is he here yet?

1:16:09.920 --> 1:16:11.955
Yes. He's in the viewing room.

1:16:12.089 --> 1:16:14.558
He wanted to spend a little time
alone with his mom.

1:16:14.692 --> 1:16:15.893
Of course.

1:16:58.335 --> 1:16:59.403
It's okay, Mom.

1:17:03.240 --> 1:17:06.343
I bet you're going to be
a princess in your next life.

1:17:22.659 --> 1:17:25.629
<i>Valerie wasn't really
equipped to take care of Oak.</i>

1:17:25.729 --> 1:17:27.131
She never went to church,

1:17:27.231 --> 1:17:28.499
she never listened to us.

1:17:28.632 --> 1:17:30.835
She straightened out
a little bit after the navy,

1:17:30.901 --> 1:17:32.202
I mean, she was a good woman.

1:17:32.336 --> 1:17:34.873
Well, even so,
after her illness,

1:17:34.938 --> 1:17:37.408
she wasn't capable
of taking care of herself.

1:17:37.508 --> 1:17:38.409
Illness?

1:17:39.009 --> 1:17:40.010
She had lupus.

1:17:40.411 --> 1:17:43.380
Yeah. She didn't want
anyone to know, especially Oak.

1:17:44.081 --> 1:17:46.917
Yeah. Her trouble started
right after the accident.

1:17:47.384 --> 1:17:50.687
Broke her back when she was only
five months pregnant with Oak.

1:17:51.054 --> 1:17:53.357
- It was all Randall's fault.
- Randall?

1:17:53.590 --> 1:17:56.727
- Oak's father.
- Yeah, a total degenerate.

1:17:57.561 --> 1:18:00.364
Stinking drunk on the night
of the car accident,

1:18:00.431 --> 1:18:03.133
wound up driving the wrong way
on the freeway,

1:18:03.667 --> 1:18:07.237
and the good thing
is that Randall died that night.

1:18:07.337 --> 1:18:09.540
- Good riddance!
- Oh, Frank.

1:18:09.640 --> 1:18:10.340
I don't care.

1:18:10.574 --> 1:18:12.844
Was it... was it January 18th,
the accident?

1:18:13.243 --> 1:18:16.980
Oh, it was in January,
but it could've been the 18th.

1:18:17.080 --> 1:18:18.215
Where was the accident?

1:18:19.082 --> 1:18:22.453
- Long Beach, somewhere.
- No, no, it was in Los Angeles.

1:18:22.553 --> 1:18:25.556
What does it matter?
It's all in the past now.

1:18:52.649 --> 1:18:53.550
It was her.

1:18:54.752 --> 1:18:55.652

1:18:57.621 --> 1:18:58.522

Perfect. Uh, Oak's fort
still needs packing.

1:20:31.448 --> 1:20:34.451
Uh, Frank, Priscilla,
can I talk to you guys a minute?

1:20:34.685 --> 1:20:36.286
- Sure.
- Sure. Sure.

1:20:40.858 --> 1:20:42.259
So, um,

1:20:42.626 --> 1:20:44.394
I don't know
what you've decided.

1:20:45.662 --> 1:20:46.798
Oak loves it here.

1:20:47.230 --> 1:20:49.767
You know, he has friends,
he has a life.

1:20:50.701 --> 1:20:53.437
I would be honored
to take Oak on as his guardian.

1:20:54.204 --> 1:20:55.539
And it wouldn't just be me.

1:20:55.606 --> 1:20:57.274
You know,
they say it takes an army,

1:20:57.341 --> 1:21:01.612
and between myself,
the band, Pedro, D.B.,

1:21:01.980 --> 1:21:03.647
an army is what we can offer.

1:21:04.214 --> 1:21:07.351
An, uh, Army of Love,
so to speak. Right, D.B.?

1:21:08.118 --> 1:21:09.686
I think this environment

1:21:09.754 --> 1:21:12.056
- might not be the best...
- Look, it's just best

1:21:12.356 --> 1:21:14.926
if Oak comes to Minnesota.

1:21:15.392 --> 1:21:17.260
We are his real family.

1:21:18.896 --> 1:21:19.831
I see.

1:21:20.497 --> 1:21:21.698
I feel like his family, too.

1:21:21.766 --> 1:21:24.836
Oh, honey,
I know you love him. I can tell.

1:21:24.902 --> 1:21:27.337
He's going to be just fine.

1:21:27.738 --> 1:21:28.639
Hey.

1:21:31.575 --> 1:21:32.643
Uh...

1:21:33.276 --> 1:21:35.079
I'm gonna help him
with his fort.

1:21:35.178 --> 1:21:37.280
- Oh, well, we'll give you some time alone.
- Sure.

1:21:37.381 --> 1:21:39.216
<i>We'll go do Valerie's bedroom.</i>

1:21:39.282 --> 1:21:40.384
Okay.

1:21:43.553 --> 1:21:44.454
Can I join you?

1:21:45.355 --> 1:21:47.190
They said
I have to go with them.

1:21:50.394 --> 1:21:52.496
I said
I wanted you to stay here.

1:21:53.330 --> 1:21:54.698
I said I'd be your guardian.

1:21:54.999 --> 1:21:55.933
And?

1:22:00.972 --> 1:22:02.940
Try hard enough, I guess.

1:22:03.340 --> 1:22:05.742
Oak, your grandparents,
they just want you with them.

1:22:05.843 --> 1:22:07.644
Nobody asked me what I wanted.

1:22:08.412 --> 1:22:09.981
And you just wanted me
to be Vaughn.

1:22:10.081 --> 1:22:12.683
Some decisions
don't belong to us, okay?

1:22:12.749 --> 1:22:14.952
I'm... I'm an adult.
I'm still learning that.

1:22:15.053 --> 1:22:16.386
You said we were family.

1:22:16.988 --> 1:22:18.488
That you'd always
take care of me.

1:22:18.588 --> 1:22:20.858
I don't even know
my grandparents!

1:22:21.191 --> 1:22:23.627
Why do they get to decide?

1:22:24.628 --> 1:22:27.932
You didn't even find my guitar
like you promised.

1:22:28.532 --> 1:22:30.367
You're a liar!

1:22:30.434 --> 1:22:32.235
Everything all right in here?

1:22:33.971 --> 1:22:35.907
I don't wanna go!

1:22:36.007 --> 1:22:37.008
Come on, Oak!

1:22:37.075 --> 1:22:38.709
Kids are meant to be seen,
not heard.

1:22:38.776 --> 1:22:40.410
Now, calm down, son.

1:22:42.914 --> 1:22:44.115
Look, Gina. Uh,

1:22:44.614 --> 1:22:47.985
we're staying down the street
at the Hotel Lafayette,

1:22:48.052 --> 1:22:49.887
uh, until our flight
leaves tomorrow.

1:22:49.987 --> 1:22:53.423
So, if... if you wanna come by
for one last goodbye...

1:22:54.257 --> 1:22:55.392
we leave at noon.

1:23:09.740 --> 1:23:11.008
Well?

1:23:11.308 --> 1:23:13.276
No.
He's leaving with them tomorrow.

1:23:13.343 --> 1:23:15.445
I'm so sorry, Jean Jacket.

1:23:20.550 --> 1:23:23.020
I was just starting to like
that little bastard.

1:23:23.821 --> 1:23:24.856
No, it's okay.

1:23:25.355 --> 1:23:27.925
- It's okay.
- I need to let him go.

1:23:28.458 --> 1:23:30.795
Set him free, you know,
it's what's best.

1:23:31.829 --> 1:23:32.729
I'm proud of you.

1:23:34.264 --> 1:23:35.298
By the way...

1:23:35.800 --> 1:23:37.769
the drunk driver
that killed Vaughn...

1:23:38.368 --> 1:23:39.469
that was Oak's father.

1:23:40.204 --> 1:23:44.474
Valerie was in the car, too,
four months pregnant with Oak.

1:23:44.976 --> 1:23:45.943
For real?

1:23:49.847 --> 1:23:50.782
Wow.

1:23:52.183 --> 1:23:53.617
Now, that is freaky.

- You just missed her.

1:24:08.966 --> 1:24:10.802
She borrowed 3,000 bucks
then left in a hurry.

1:24:10.868 --> 1:24:12.636
Wait... and gave her the money?
Are you crazy?

1:24:12.736 --> 1:24:14.238

1:27:07.378 --> 1:27:08.478
Hey.

1:27:09.447 --> 1:27:11.514
I don't wanna
say goodbye to you.

1:27:14.051 --> 1:27:15.652
Just know that I love you.

1:27:16.420 --> 1:27:18.155

1:27:18.956 --> 1:27:19.991

1:27:39.276 --> 1:27:40.244

1:28:26.689 --> 1:28:28.826
Guess it wasn't meant to be
after all.

1:28:30.727 --> 1:28:32.897
Yeah, I guess not.

1:28:33.696 --> 1:28:35.299
Uh, I still don't believe.

1:28:36.967 --> 1:28:38.235

1:28:39.036 --> 1:28:39.970
You will.

1:28:40.805 --> 1:28:42.339
But you're right
about one thing.

1:28:42.406 --> 1:28:44.041
I... I had to let him go.

1:28:44.741 --> 1:28:48.212
Gina, how many views
did you buy for our video?

1:28:48.979 --> 1:28:51.282
Uh, 50,000,
enough to get noticed. Why?

1:28:52.049 --> 1:28:54.251
It's 700,000 now.

1:28:54.351 --> 1:28:56.420
Oh, that's why Chris
at the Belly Up

1:28:56.487 --> 1:28:57.555
was blowing up my phone.

1:28:57.620 --> 1:28:59.490

1:28:59.722 --> 1:29:01.624

we can't get Oak back?

1:29:01.759 --> 1:29:02.927

1:29:03.027 --> 1:29:04.995
but I could be

today, man?

1:29:07.565 --> 1:29:09.599

1:29:10.768 --> 1:29:12.470
Just... that's okay.

1:29:12.702 --> 1:29:14.171

1:29:14.338 --> 1:29:15.239
Bye.

1:29:17.607 --> 1:29:19.343

about that.

1:29:48.105 --> 1:29:50.740

avocado toast is beyond.

1:29:50.875 --> 1:29:55.379

- They thought you should have it.

1:32:50.054 --> 1:32:52.823

from our daughter.

1:32:53.157 --> 1:32:55.292
And apparently,
it was her dying wish

1:32:55.359 --> 1:32:58.529
that Oak be with...
where his family is.

1:33:05.602 --> 1:33:07.071

1:33:23.053 --> 1:33:25.055

1:33:25.923 --> 1:33:27.157

Oak!

1:33:52.449 --> 1:33:54.418
- Almost done writing.
- <i>Oak! Show time! Now!</i>
