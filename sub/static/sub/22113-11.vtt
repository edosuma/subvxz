TANDY: <i>Still out
in the wild? Yeah.</i>

00:08.584 --> 00:10.251
We have to talk about Karl.

GAIL: <i>If you don't like
him, that probably ensures</i>

Oh. Edwina Mendoza, you did
not deserve to be vomited on.

00:50.401 --> 00:54.784
But if you saw what we just
saw, there was a man eating...

00:54.811 --> 00:56.577
(VOMITING)

00:59.549 --> 01:00.481
He's doing it again.

ERICA: I haven't seen him.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.756
Well, we have seen
him, and it is not good.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.525
Yeah. W-We got here
as fast as we could,

01:33.593 --> 01:35.426
but we had to pull over
to hork, like, ten times.

01:35.529 --> 01:36.528
That's what this is.

01:36.596 --> 01:37.695
- That's disgusting.
- Ew.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.564
This is not the time to argue, okay?

01:39.641 --> 01:42.144
'Cause right now, we are like the
cast of the <i> Jersey Shore.</i>

01:42.157 --> 01:44.293
'Cause we got a "The Situation."

01:44.318 --> 01:45.804
All right. Karl is a bad dude.

01:45.872 --> 01:48.021
Ah. Here we go again.

01:48.046 --> 01:49.574
Would you lay off the guy already?

01:49.599 --> 01:51.532
We just followed him to a cemetery

01:51.626 --> 01:55.243
where we saw him dig
up a frigging grave,

01:55.268 --> 01:57.382
and then he reached into the...

01:57.484 --> 01:58.650
- (DRY HEAVES)
- Ah...

01:59.786 --> 02:01.419
- I'm gonna go, bud.
- Well, if you go,

02:01.488 --> 02:02.487
I'm gonna go, bud.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.621
Oh, don't go.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.590
(PANTING)

02:05.692 --> 02:08.693
He reached into a frigging grave,

02:08.751 --> 02:13.627
and pulled out a dead dude and ate it.

02:13.792 --> 02:15.332
- (HIGH-PITCHED): Ate it.
- MELISSA: What?

02:15.333 --> 02:16.001
- What?
- Yeah.

02:16.031 --> 02:17.477
That's insane.

02:17.502 --> 02:18.501
- Todd saw it, too.
- I did.

02:18.738 --> 02:20.672
I was a witness. He tells what we saw.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.669
Well, that just can't be what happened.

02:22.670 --> 02:25.001
Yeah, there has to be
some logical explanation

02:25.047 --> 02:25.921
for all of this.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.353
Yeah, he was probably just too hungry

02:27.455 --> 02:29.131
to not eat human corpse meat.

02:29.156 --> 02:31.139
Okay, how far away were you?

02:31.226 --> 02:32.291
Uh, probably about a hundred yards.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.393
But we had binoculars.

02:33.461 --> 02:35.328
Which end were you looking into?

02:35.397 --> 02:37.918
The little end, Gail. The little end.

02:37.943 --> 02:40.299
Are you sure he wasn't
just playing a trick on you?

02:40.368 --> 02:41.467
He is very funny.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.236
And very smart, too.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.667
He's Karl.

02:44.690 --> 02:46.339
He was digging up a grave, okay?

02:46.408 --> 02:48.174
I am 100% sure about that.

02:48.243 --> 02:52.211
Is there a possibility that
that's not what you saw?

02:52.280 --> 02:53.688
Absolutely.

02:53.713 --> 02:54.645
Oh...

02:54.697 --> 02:55.381
TANDY: Okay. Come on.

02:55.450 --> 02:57.858
- Come on!
- Thanks for nothing.

Come on, come on.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.298
He's here, grab a weapon! Grab a weapon!

03:12.367 --> 03:14.133
- Okay, what? Uh...
- Oh, I got something.

03:14.202 --> 03:15.669
- Here, here. You take this.
- Oh, thanks.

03:15.694 --> 03:17.140
And I'll get this plate.

03:17.165 --> 03:19.305
(SHOUTS, GRUNTS)

03:19.407 --> 03:22.208
Okay, everyone, just be
calm, cool, collected.

03:22.277 --> 03:23.409
Cool and collected. Go.

03:23.511 --> 03:25.144
Oh, poor Karl.

03:25.213 --> 03:26.446
GAIL: I know. Well, it's a momentary

03:26.514 --> 03:29.731
bummer for Karl, but on the
flip, a pretty good show for us.

03:29.756 --> 03:30.936
- Mm. Yeah.
- TANDY: Cool and casual.

03:31.063 --> 03:32.028
Here he comes, here he comes.

03:32.042 --> 03:34.042
Cool and casual. Cool
and collected and calm.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.584
(WHISPERING): A general subject.

03:35.724 --> 03:37.323
Hey, Karl.

03:37.392 --> 03:39.325
Hey, we almost forgot you were gone.

03:39.394 --> 03:41.227
Hey, Todd, look who it is.

03:41.329 --> 03:42.395
Whatever.

03:42.464 --> 03:44.497
(TANDY LAUGHS)

03:44.566 --> 03:46.466
(STAMMERING) So-so, uh,

03:46.534 --> 03:48.201
how about this freaking weather?

03:48.269 --> 03:50.236
Huh? Huh? Todd, engage in this.

03:50.305 --> 03:51.304
Give us your take.

03:51.406 --> 03:52.472
Yeah, it's been, uh, very similar.

03:52.540 --> 03:54.240
You know, uh, uh, consistent.

03:54.309 --> 03:56.275
Actually, no. I'm sorry, I mean similar.

03:56.344 --> 03:58.311
No... I'm-I'm sorry. I mean consistent.

03:58.379 --> 04:01.380
Whatever. Wha... Whatever, man. (LAUGHS)

04:01.483 --> 04:04.150
(TANDY AND TODD LAUGH)

04:04.219 --> 04:05.711
So, hey, Karl.

04:05.736 --> 04:07.941
So w-whatcha you been
getting up to, uh,

04:07.966 --> 04:09.899
you know, uh, location-wise?

04:09.962 --> 04:12.892
Oh, I was just, um, out at a graveyard.

04:12.917 --> 04:15.584
(STAMMERING) So-so-so
you don't say?

04:15.717 --> 04:17.396
You don't say? Huh?

04:17.464 --> 04:21.233
Well, uh... and what were you
doing, on-on earth, out there?

04:21.302 --> 04:22.535
Well, I've been pretty stressed lately.

04:22.604 --> 04:24.537
Well, that's the logical
place for a mental reboot,

04:25.210 --> 04:26.685
- is what that is.
- Yeah.

04:26.710 --> 04:28.174
I needed to clear my head.

04:28.243 --> 04:30.153
Recenter myself.

04:30.178 --> 04:31.536
Now, Karl...

04:31.561 --> 04:32.919
KARL: Mm-hmm?

04:32.944 --> 04:36.315
What would you say if I
told you that Todd and I

04:36.384 --> 04:40.733
were at that there, that,
uh, cemetery tonight?

04:40.823 --> 04:42.857
Well, what did you see out there?

04:42.882 --> 04:46.521
Uh, from where we were perched,

04:46.546 --> 04:48.561
uh, we noticed, uh, you know,

04:48.630 --> 04:50.596
something rather alarming.

04:50.698 --> 04:53.566
Eh, stupefying, even.

04:53.635 --> 04:55.334
You did?

04:55.403 --> 04:58.337
See, looked to us...

04:58.406 --> 05:01.140
like maybe you had dug
your little fingie-wingies

05:01.209 --> 05:03.309
into a little cadavey-wavvy,

05:03.378 --> 05:08.114
and then took a teeny eeny
weenie little bitesy-witesy.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.248
(ERICA CLICKS TONGUE)

05:09.715 --> 05:10.948
KARL: Mm-hmm.

05:11.141 --> 05:14.810
And you want to sort of know
what that was all about, huh?

05:15.892 --> 05:17.290
Yeah.

05:17.358 --> 05:21.015
Look, the quick answer is: yeah.

05:21.119 --> 05:23.953
I took a couple little nibbles.

05:24.060 --> 05:26.409
Okay, I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.

05:26.434 --> 05:28.267
(EXHALES)

05:28.336 --> 05:31.404
My name is Karl, and I am a cannibal.

05:31.472 --> 05:34.373
- (GASPS)
- Oh, God, yes.

05:34.442 --> 05:36.475
It's like a weight has been lifted.

05:36.544 --> 05:39.171
Anyway, this has been such a day.

05:39.196 --> 05:41.214
So why don't we all get some sleep,

05:41.316 --> 05:43.349
and we can pick this up in the morning.

05:43.418 --> 05:45.203
It'll give you, uh, time

05:45.228 --> 05:48.990
to process this and formulate
some questions for me.

05:49.030 --> 05:51.617
And hey, I'm gonna have
some questions for you.

05:51.695 --> 05:52.827
It's a two-way street.

05:52.834 --> 05:54.043
This is a dialogue.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.020
Good people on both sides.

05:56.300 --> 05:58.003
All right. Well, good night, guys.

05:58.028 --> 06:00.662
Lock your doors. Mean that.

06:07.584 --> 06:08.460
(SOFT KNOCKING)

06:08.944 --> 06:10.277
Come insies.

06:10.346 --> 06:12.346
(DOOR CREAKING)

06:19.959 --> 06:21.042
Hey, Karl.

06:21.123 --> 06:23.890
Uh... Now, I know you had mentioned

06:23.959 --> 06:26.877
having a chat in the morning,
but we think we might be able

06:26.959 --> 06:30.877
to cobble a little time together
right now, if you're up for it.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.933
Sure thing, Jelly Bean.

06:41.918 --> 06:43.960
It's bugging you, isn't it?

06:47.950 --> 06:49.182
Aw.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.251
Thank you.

06:56.992 --> 06:59.793
I realize it might be hard
for you to drink in that thing,

06:59.876 --> 07:01.876
so I brought you this crazy...

07:02.292 --> 07:06.292
I mean, "mentally abnormal" straw.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.126
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

07:18.498 --> 07:20.276
Oh, nice.

07:21.283 --> 07:22.849
- Carol?
- Yeah?

07:22.918 --> 07:24.050
- (SHOUTING MANIACALLY)
- (SCREAMS)

07:24.119 --> 07:25.952
- (SHOTGUN COCKS)
- Whoa! Hey!

07:26.021 --> 07:27.829
(CHUCKLING) I gotcha there.

07:27.868 --> 07:31.224
Sorry. Oh, it's too soon.
It's too soon. I'm sorry.

07:31.293 --> 07:33.059
In all seriousness, though,
you're gonna want to keep

07:33.128 --> 07:34.261
a five-foot radius.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.272
That's what I call the lunge zone.

07:36.397 --> 07:38.064
Noted.

07:38.795 --> 07:40.867
Okay, I know what you guys are thinking.

07:40.936 --> 07:42.068
Is it a problem?

07:42.309 --> 07:44.309
Sure, yeah, big-time problem.

07:44.373 --> 07:46.873
So, let's get into it.

07:46.942 --> 07:49.943
D-Do you want to kill us?

07:50.012 --> 07:52.879
Do I want to kill you? Well...

07:52.948 --> 07:54.730
that's why I came back here.

07:54.755 --> 07:55.746
- GAIL: What the...?
- (ALL GROANING)

07:55.771 --> 07:57.824
KARL: No, wait. It's a miscommunication.

07:57.849 --> 08:01.274
I came back because, guys,

08:01.313 --> 08:02.956
I do want to kill you.

08:02.991 --> 08:04.057
- Okay, you just said that.
- That's exactly

08:04.126 --> 08:05.926
- what you just said.
- KARL: I'm sorry, um,

08:05.994 --> 08:07.260
I left too long of a pause in there.

08:07.362 --> 08:11.064
I do want to kill you,<i> but...</i>

08:11.133 --> 08:13.635
See, the pause works better
there, after the "but." But...

08:13.667 --> 08:15.585
I wanted you to know
that I wanted to kill you

08:15.600 --> 08:17.915
before I <i> did</i> kill you.

08:17.940 --> 08:19.039
This making sense?

08:19.141 --> 08:20.944
- No.
- Not really.

08:21.694 --> 08:25.045
I've-I've battled a lot
of demons in my life.

08:25.125 --> 08:27.001
But after spending all
that time in prison,

08:27.049 --> 08:29.115
I thought I had them beat.

08:29.218 --> 08:32.219
And I'm finding out now
that maybe I'm not as strong

08:32.287 --> 08:34.821
as I... I hoped I'd be.

08:34.923 --> 08:36.804
So you don't want to kill us?

08:37.258 --> 08:40.159
I desperately don't want to kill you.

08:40.229 --> 08:42.162
But you might kill us anyway?

08:42.568 --> 08:43.974
I mean...

08:43.999 --> 08:46.867
Karl, could you give us one sec?

08:46.935 --> 08:48.068
I think it's safe to say

08:48.136 --> 08:49.970
we're way beyond the stocks on this one.

08:50.038 --> 08:50.971
We have to kill him.

08:51.039 --> 08:52.839
- Melissa...
- No, no.

08:52.941 --> 08:54.975
We can't decide who lives or dies.

08:55.043 --> 08:57.177
- We're not J.K. Rowling.
- I-I got it.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.683
You know, when I was a kid, my
dad caught me with a cigarette.

08:59.708 --> 09:01.882
He made me smoke the whole
pack right in front of him.

09:01.950 --> 09:03.216
I say we take him back to the grave

09:03.285 --> 09:06.602
and make him eat that
whole corpse in one sitting.

09:06.627 --> 09:08.569
We're trying to get rid
of him, not cure him.

09:08.594 --> 09:09.805
We have to kill him!

09:09.834 --> 09:11.626
- GAIL: We're not murderers.
- No.

09:11.710 --> 09:13.643
All we do is drive
him out to the desert,

09:13.745 --> 09:15.812
tell him to check the
tire, and just take off.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.383
Like you did to me, bud?

09:17.485 --> 09:19.716
Uh, but didn't do to
you, 'cause you're great.

09:19.784 --> 09:21.784
But, yeah. W-What I didn't do to Todd.

09:21.853 --> 09:23.720
Guys, how many times
do I have to say this?

09:23.822 --> 09:24.754
We have to kill him.

09:24.823 --> 09:26.723
- Melissa! No!
- No.

09:26.791 --> 09:28.091
Look, we don't want to kill him.

09:28.159 --> 09:29.992
Obviously, we don't want him around.

09:30.061 --> 09:32.159
I think I have a solution.

09:32.501 --> 09:35.960
KARL: So, I said to him, "I
already paid for a fill-up.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.800
I'm paying for air, too?"

09:37.869 --> 09:38.968
I mean, what's next?

09:39.037 --> 09:42.548
They're gonna package
gravity, make me buy that?

09:42.573 --> 09:43.773
Or vision?

09:43.875 --> 09:45.108
You know, I can't
open my eyes if I don't

09:45.176 --> 09:47.285
pay the oil companies?

09:47.310 --> 09:50.880
You know, it's just,
no. Enough is enough.

09:51.263 --> 09:53.472
Well, here we are.

09:53.497 --> 09:54.951
Oh, can I finish the story?

09:55.053 --> 09:56.786
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

09:56.855 --> 10:00.790
So, I just left. Right? I just drove off

10:00.859 --> 10:02.649
with a partially inflated tire.

10:02.674 --> 10:05.360
After a couple minutes, you
know, I kind of cooled down.

10:05.385 --> 10:08.664
I came back, right, to apologize.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.701
But Dane already finished
his shift. (LAUGHS)

10:11.770 --> 10:13.035
- He was gone.
- No way.

10:13.138 --> 10:17.807
I come back the next day, right,
with a cup of coffee for him.

10:17.876 --> 10:21.336
I got it for free in
the lobby at a hotel.

10:21.422 --> 10:25.521
Regardless, he appreciated the gesture.

10:25.575 --> 10:27.621
- Right?
- Yeah.

10:27.646 --> 10:30.720
And it just... (GRUNTS)
it just shows you.

10:30.789 --> 10:33.956
I mean, think about
that. It just shows you.

10:34.058 --> 10:37.693
- It shows all of us.
- Yeah.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.840
Worth the wait. Worth the wait.

10:40.865 --> 10:43.733
So, uh, guess this is it.

10:44.207 --> 10:45.902
- Yep.
- Hey,

10:46.004 --> 10:47.970
we'll check in on you from time to time.

10:48.039 --> 10:50.740
- Really?
- To see if you're dead.

10:50.989 --> 10:53.255
Oh, yeah, of course.

10:53.417 --> 10:56.376
Well... what do you say, you know?

10:56.417 --> 10:58.751
It's, uh... it's been a...

10:58.783 --> 11:00.407
- God, why is this so hard?
- I don't know.

11:00.432 --> 11:02.032
- You know?
- Guys,

11:02.057 --> 11:03.786
you're doing the right thing.

11:13.051 --> 11:15.118
- Bye, Karl.
- Bye, bud.

11:16.083 --> 11:19.001
- Uh, you want to give me a hand?
- Yeah.

11:19.459 --> 11:23.126
- (LAUGHS) You know what I mean.
- Let's chain her up.

11:23.208 --> 11:25.708
(CHAINS RATTLING)

11:27.979 --> 11:29.812
Okay.

11:32.812 --> 11:35.398
Well, that closes that chapter.

11:39.312 --> 11:40.790
TODD: Hey.

11:40.859 --> 11:42.124
(SIGHS) How'd it go?

11:42.193 --> 11:43.860
It's done.

11:43.928 --> 11:44.927
Where you headed off to?

11:44.996 --> 11:45.962
Going to the store.

11:46.030 --> 11:47.763
I thought you just went yesterday?

11:47.832 --> 11:48.940
A different store.

11:48.965 --> 11:50.898
Period stuff?

11:51.475 --> 11:52.835
Yeah.

11:52.904 --> 11:54.036
Yeah, I could drive you, hon.

11:54.105 --> 11:56.038
Yeah. I was gonna head back
out and look for Jasper.

11:56.107 --> 11:58.229
We never made it past the prison, so...

11:58.254 --> 12:00.308
Oh. No, that's okay. Um,
it's gonna be a quick trip.

12:00.333 --> 12:01.299
So, I'll see you later.

12:01.324 --> 12:02.945
It's period stuff.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.847
Yeah.

12:05.878 --> 12:08.503
MELISSA: So, you thinking
of coming back anytime soon?

12:08.933 --> 12:10.887
And there's no pressure
on my end, but...

12:11.501 --> 12:13.918
Todd misses you,

12:13.959 --> 12:17.042
and I don't think I can
hold him off forever.

12:19.337 --> 12:21.931
Okay. See you tomorrow?

12:31.125 --> 12:33.751
TODD: Jasper!

12:34.537 --> 12:36.638
Jasper?

12:42.540 --> 12:44.373
What the hell?

12:52.362 --> 12:54.262
Oh, God, he's out.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.585
Guys! Guys!

12:57.626 --> 12:58.920
Karl is out!

12:58.959 --> 13:00.001
Karl is out!

13:00.079 --> 13:02.285
- What?
- What do you mean he's "out"?

13:02.334 --> 13:04.793
I mean the prison is open. He is out!

13:04.834 --> 13:07.084
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gol. You lock the doors.

13:07.125 --> 13:08.208
You got to get the babies!

13:08.255 --> 13:09.220
Where are you going, hon?

13:09.289 --> 13:12.223
I... (SIGHS) I'm going to get Jasper.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.925
How are you gonna do that?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.250
(SIGHS) I know where he is.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.959
He's been living by the
prison, so I have to go get him.

13:18.984 --> 13:22.200
Wait, what? You knew where
Jasper was this whole time?

13:24.130 --> 13:25.095
I-I should go.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.616
No, we need to talk about this.

13:26.641 --> 13:28.592
But can't it wait? There's
a killer on the loose.

13:28.626 --> 13:29.709
He could be anywhere.

14:06.584 --> 14:07.864
It was so easy.

14:07.889 --> 14:10.815
Guess I was just so motivated to
get back here and see you guys.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.294
It's all I needed.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.386
It's a real testament to
setting goals. (CHUCKLES)

14:14.721 --> 14:17.555

14:17.624 --> 14:22.627

I want to be deep inside.

14:32.548 --> 14:34.926
You know what you need to do.

14:39.148 --> 14:41.047
So, how do we do this?

14:41.115 --> 14:44.350
Well, first of all, are
there any volunteers?

14:48.167 --> 14:51.542
Oh, sure. Everyone looks at
me when someone needs killing.

14:51.626 --> 14:53.267
No, I don't want to do it.

14:53.330 --> 14:56.056
I took the liberty of
cutting up some straws.

14:56.094 --> 14:59.345
Yeah, I guess drawing straws
is as fair as anything.

14:59.916 --> 15:01.732
You know how it works.

15:02.206 --> 15:04.172

15:19.667 --> 15:21.585
You got to draw one, hon.

15:21.688 --> 15:24.489
I know. We are talking
about murdering someone,

15:24.557 --> 15:26.757
so... just give me a second.

15:36.959 --> 15:39.710
Okay, hold out your straws.

16:15.067 --> 16:17.666

16:17.667 --> 16:19.917
(CHUCKLES) Thanks for asking.

16:21.478 --> 16:23.399

Well, then who's gonna do it?

- Me.
- No, Tandy.

16:27.957 --> 16:31.522

drew the shortest straw.

16:32.501 --> 16:33.733
Did you?

16:37.626 --> 16:38.891
Tandy.

16:38.916 --> 16:40.440

16:56.959 --> 16:58.502
Yeah, I know.

of the longer straws.

(CHUCKLES) I'm not doing
this for that, Carol. Okay?

17:07.627 --> 17:10.035
I already got more than
enough praise inside.

17:10.105 --> 17:11.796
I tried to cut it privately,

17:11.897 --> 17:14.531
but it ended up being
a rather public affair.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.310

17:16.336 --> 17:17.935
cried a little bit and such.

just make your way over

17:51.375 --> 17:53.584

18:16.148 --> 18:19.182

- Thank you!

18:29.406 --> 18:33.352
Well, uh, if you don't mind,
uh, this is very hard for me.

18:33.388 --> 18:37.451
So to separate myself from the
grim reality of the situation,

18:37.476 --> 18:41.452
I thought it'd be helpful to
do a, uh, a theme execution.

18:41.477 --> 18:42.395
Love it.

18:42.430 --> 18:43.680
Oh, good.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.932
Now, I've chosen the Broadway
smash,<i> Hamilton.</i>

18:45.967 --> 18:48.000
And obviously, I'll
be Alexander Hamilton

18:48.036 --> 18:49.268
and you will be Aaron Berg.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.170
- Burr.
- You need a sweater?

18:51.205 --> 18:52.827
- I'm fine.

in a few minutes anyway, huh?

18:55.443 --> 18:57.567
Well, this is it.

18:57.592 --> 19:00.212
So, uh, I'm gonna turn around,

19:00.452 --> 19:03.653
walk ten paces, and
then pull out the gun

19:03.678 --> 19:06.218
and shoot you in the face.

19:06.519 --> 19:10.056
Um, if it's okay, it would
help me take my mind off things

19:10.091 --> 19:11.924
if I could keep playing this.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.808
I know it's anachronistic for
the <i> Hamilton</i> time period,

19:14.833 --> 19:18.197
but so was rap and people
seemed to like that.

19:18.419 --> 19:21.154
Hey, cube it up.

19:22.329 --> 19:25.104
Practice shot, vase!

19:25.451 --> 19:27.921
Ah. Sucker moved on me.

19:27.946 --> 19:29.438
CAROL: Is it over?

19:29.463 --> 19:31.944
Practice shot! Doing it now!

19:31.980 --> 19:35.047
CAROL: Okay, uh, bye again, Karl!

19:35.116 --> 19:37.848
Bye! Who's that, Gail?

19:37.873 --> 19:39.251
Carol!

19:39.287 --> 19:40.686
Sorry.

19:40.711 --> 19:43.990
I'm gonna get your names right
if it's the last thing I do.

19:44.025 --> 19:45.291
(CHUCKLES) Oh.

19:45.326 --> 19:47.360

19:47.699 --> 19:49.432
It begins.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.001
two...

20:12.805 --> 20:13.632
three...

20:13.657 --> 20:15.868
- So I move this around here.
- Four...

20:15.893 --> 20:17.323
This will easily go in...

20:17.358 --> 20:20.259
- Five paces! Halfway there!
- Take your time.

20:20.294 --> 20:21.644
I'm almost finished with this cube.

20:21.667 --> 20:24.001
Six... seven...

20:24.032 --> 20:26.756
- Mm, almost there.
- Eight...

20:26.781 --> 20:28.394
nine...

20:32.058 --> 20:33.139
ten.
