00:10.120 --> 00:11.417
It was her!
She did it!

00:11.420 --> 00:12.660
I kill all.

00:12.670 --> 00:15.707
On land. In water. All.

[Calvin] You really think
that anyone is gonna believe

00:41.170 --> 00:42.819

00:42.830 --> 00:44.286
and stabbed our captain?

to untangle a line,

00:46.330 --> 00:48.207

and he went overboard.

00:48.210 --> 00:50.110

Did you talk to your dad?

01:20.380 --> 01:22.200
How'd it go?

01:22.210 --> 01:24.326
He says he's fine,

-You don't believe him.

his face, you know?

he gonna be gone?

01:35.380 --> 01:37.530
A day, maybe two.

01:37.540 --> 01:39.781
My dad has his own way
of dealing with loss.

01:39.790 --> 01:40.996
Always has.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.570
Mm-hmm.

01:42.580 --> 01:45.037
These clothes?

01:45.040 --> 01:47.497
Why?

01:47.500 --> 01:51.243
Um... this is a way
people show their respect

01:51.250 --> 01:52.706
when someone dies.

01:52.710 --> 01:55.247
I want to know.

01:55.250 --> 01:57.571
What else do humans do?

01:57.580 --> 01:59.741
It depends. Um...

01:59.750 --> 02:02.321
When there's a body,

02:02.330 --> 02:05.993
some people might choose
to bury that body
in the ground,

02:06.000 --> 02:08.992
or they might cremate
the body,

02:09.000 --> 02:11.070
which means to burn it.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.412
Or, like my dad, he goes
into nature to grieve.

02:13.420 --> 02:16.617
Different people show grief
in different ways.

02:16.620 --> 02:18.247
It's complicated.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.161
It especially complicated
when there's no body.

This death my fault.

she will kill.

She killed your friend.

in danger, Ryn.

02:35.830 --> 02:37.457

02:37.460 --> 02:39.667
I knew what your sister
was capable of.

02:39.670 --> 02:40.785
She's a predator.

02:40.790 --> 02:42.280
An animal.

02:42.290 --> 02:45.327
And I led Sean
straight to his death.

for his knife, but...

They tried to kill

Ryn tried to kill me
in the water.

04:43.580 --> 04:45.707
In the water,
Ryn is different.

That's exactly what I can't
stop thinking about.

I mean, she killed Donnie.

Ben, she was
defending herself.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.531
What if shefs
more of an animal

04:57.540 --> 04:59.326
than we've been
willing to admit?

04:59.330 --> 05:02.379
I don't believe Ryn
is just an animal.

05:02.380 --> 05:04.450
I believe
Ryn has changed.

05:04.460 --> 05:08.578
She's spent time with us.
She trusts us.

I believe Ryn is good.

15:17.210 --> 15:18.950
[all] To Sean!

15:27.120 --> 15:28.667
Another round, Janine!

15:32.880 --> 15:35.201
Hey.
All you freeloaders

15:35.210 --> 15:36.666
gettin' drunk
on my dad's account.

15:40.830 --> 15:43.663
Not every day
that a fisherman dies, so...

15:51.040 --> 15:54.032
But thank you all for

15:54.040 --> 15:57.168
comin' out,
payin' your respects,

15:57.170 --> 15:58.819
and, uh, to my mom,

15:58.830 --> 16:00.036
Patti McClure, everybody.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.326
Give her... Give her a hand.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.951
Um, I wrote a few...

16:08.960 --> 16:11.281
a few things down, so, uh...

16:16.250 --> 16:19.037
My dad, uh...

16:19.040 --> 16:21.110
he was a giant.

16:21.120 --> 16:23.076
Larger than life.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.911
[sniffles] And, uh...

16:24.920 --> 16:27.662
giants aren't
supposed to die.

16:29.540 --> 16:31.747
He-- He spent his life, um...

16:35.080 --> 16:37.162
He didn't have to die.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.240
He didn't have to die.

16:39.250 --> 16:40.490
Not like this.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.075
I could have saved him.

16:46.120 --> 16:47.826
He didn't have to die.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.201
There are things out there.

16:54.540 --> 16:55.609
Things that we can't control.

16:58.290 --> 16:59.279
And they...

17:00.420 --> 17:01.705
And they took my dad.

17:04.330 --> 17:05.615
I'm sorry, Ma.

17:05.620 --> 17:07.827
I'm gonna
make this up to you.

17:07.830 --> 17:08.990
Gonna make it up to you.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.206
Hey, come on, man,
it's okay.

17:10.210 --> 17:11.916
Xan, come on.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.410
It's okay.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.957
I think that what Xander
was tryin' to say

17:17.960 --> 17:20.167
is that--
that the ocean is

17:20.170 --> 17:23.708
a powerful, dangerous place.

17:23.710 --> 17:28.113
No one knew this
better than Sean.

17:28.120 --> 17:31.283
I started workin' on, uh...

17:31.290 --> 17:34.532
on Sean's boat
when I was in high school,

17:34.540 --> 17:37.919
and the first thing
I learned about Sean

17:37.920 --> 17:40.912
was that he can be
a real pain in the ass.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.876
[laughter]

17:42.880 --> 17:46.281
But in my teenage eyes,

17:46.290 --> 17:51.318
he also represented
everything a man should be.

17:51.330 --> 17:52.911
He was like a father to me.

17:56.380 --> 17:58.575
I mean, he was tough,

17:59.790 --> 18:00.779
loyal,

18:01.960 --> 18:03.780
independent

18:03.790 --> 18:06.873
and he would die
for his men.

18:09.210 --> 18:11.246
I can't believe he's gone.

18:11.250 --> 18:15.243
And, uh,
like all of you in here,

18:15.250 --> 18:17.161
I'm never gonna forget him.

18:19.210 --> 18:23.533
Now if anyone else has
anything they'd like to say.

18:23.540 --> 18:25.371
[Ted] Yeah.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.240
I do.

18:46.170 --> 18:48.957
I know most of you probably
just think of me as the boss,

18:48.960 --> 18:50.370
landlocked in my office,

18:52.080 --> 18:54.878
but I started out
as a fisherman, too.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.166
And Sean and I,
we worked together

18:57.170 --> 18:58.740
back when you
could still catch

18:58.750 --> 19:02.413
a hundred-pound King salmon
off the Kenai River.

19:02.420 --> 19:06.242
Circumstances led us
in different directions,

19:06.250 --> 19:08.377
but I've always had
the highest respect for Sean.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.951
He was a great man.

19:10.960 --> 19:13.872
In his honor,
let's drink this bar dry,

19:13.880 --> 19:15.165
'cause this one's on me.

19:15.170 --> 19:17.741
[Patti] You're right.

19:17.750 --> 19:18.910
It is.

19:23.250 --> 19:26.708
All the pressures
you put on these men,

19:26.710 --> 19:29.873
and pushin' them
to fish night and day

19:29.880 --> 19:32.417
to fill your quotas,
and why?

19:32.420 --> 19:35.321
To make you richer.

19:35.330 --> 19:40.245
You are responsible
for destroying marriages
and tearing families apart.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.116
My husband is dead,

19:44.120 --> 19:47.419
but it's not 'cause
no damn net pulled
him overboard!

19:47.420 --> 19:51.493
He was overworked,
all for your greed.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.372
So you're right, Ted.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.245
This one is on you.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.452
-[man] That's right!
-Damn right!

20:05.460 --> 20:06.666
[Ben] Hey, hey, hey,
come on.

20:06.670 --> 20:08.456
We all loved Sean, okay?

20:08.460 --> 20:09.916
We're all hurting here.

20:09.920 --> 20:13.492
Ms. McClure,
you most of all.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.919
But my father is
not the bad guy here.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.990
I mean, he built
this business,

20:23.000 --> 20:26.072
but not on his own.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.492
And the whole town
has grown with it.

20:28.500 --> 20:30.491
He couldn't have done it
without all of you.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.458
And believe me,
he knows it.

20:33.460 --> 20:35.109
I mean,
if we turn on him,

20:35.120 --> 20:37.372
we might as well
all turn on each other.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.240
My fight isn't with you,
Mr. Pownall.

21:25.710 --> 21:27.075
May I?

21:29.960 --> 21:31.746
Tough crowd.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.911
You're the only one
bold enough to sit with me.

21:33.920 --> 21:37.378
[chuckles] I've
never been one to care
what people think.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.280
-That's for sure.
-Mm-hmm.

21:40.710 --> 21:43.201
I haven't received
my check this month.

21:43.210 --> 21:44.370
Sorry to hear that.

21:46.330 --> 21:49.493
We hired a new bookkeeper
for the family trust.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.115
Something must have got

21:51.120 --> 21:52.576
lost in the shuffle.

21:52.580 --> 21:54.707
You sure you need
to ask me about this now?

21:54.710 --> 21:57.531
I want to help Patti
with the expenses.

21:57.540 --> 22:00.111
You know, she works
for minimum wage?

22:00.120 --> 22:01.496
I'll get it sorted.

22:01.500 --> 22:02.785
Good.

22:04.830 --> 22:07.037
I'd like to help out, too.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.031
Anonymous contribution.

22:09.040 --> 22:12.578
That would be
very generous of you.

22:12.580 --> 22:15.492
It's a shame,
isn't it?

22:15.500 --> 22:17.570
Times like these,
I wish there wasn't

22:17.580 --> 22:19.616
so much water
under our bridge.

22:19.620 --> 22:23.408
After all, you and I,
we're family.

22:54.170 --> 22:55.569
[Wally]
Hey, miss?

22:55.580 --> 22:58.378
You mind?
We're playin' here.

23:18.920 --> 23:19.955
Hi.

23:21.540 --> 23:23.451
I thought you might
want to eat something.

23:24.830 --> 23:26.957
Thank you.

23:26.960 --> 23:28.871
Uh, Maddie?

23:28.880 --> 23:31.872
Look, I know my son
has had his struggles,

23:31.880 --> 23:35.668
but I've_ never seen him
qUIte like this.

23:35.670 --> 23:38.491
Would you tell me
if he needs help?

23:38.500 --> 23:40.070
Of course.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.571
And maybe we could
try that lunch again.

23:42.580 --> 23:45.071
We know at _least
we have one thing in common.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.820
I bet we could find
a few more.

23:51.580 --> 23:53.992
So, you and my mom.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.706
That's groundbreaking.

23:55.710 --> 23:57.666
_ We had _
a two-minute conversation.

23:57.670 --> 23:58.819
That's a start.

23:58.830 --> 24:01.321
I was surprised
to see your friend here.

24:01.330 --> 24:02.706
What friend?

24:02.710 --> 24:03.950
That girl, your friend?

24:03.960 --> 24:05.166
From the party?

24:08.380 --> 24:10.416
She's over there
playing darts.

24:18.710 --> 24:19.745
[whoosh, loud thud]

24:19.750 --> 24:21.536
Oh! Third straight time!

24:21.540 --> 24:22.700
She's a deadeye.

24:24.580 --> 24:25.911
Bet you can't do it again.

24:25.920 --> 24:27.160
[Ben] Hey.

24:27.170 --> 24:30.788
No, unfortunately,
she can't.

24:36.620 --> 24:38.702
Ryn, you can't be here.

24:38.710 --> 24:39.870
What were you thinking?

24:39.880 --> 24:41.825
I want to learn.

24:43.750 --> 24:48.073
Ben, you say
me and my people
are animals.

24:49.500 --> 24:52.617
I want to know.

24:52.620 --> 24:53.996
Know what?

24:55.580 --> 24:58.287
IfI am human.

25:00.170 --> 25:03.116
When my people die,

25:03.120 --> 25:06.032
family take body

25:06.040 --> 25:07.280
and swim

25:09.040 --> 25:10.450
for a long time.

25:10.460 --> 25:12.075
We hold on.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.377
Like a human,

25:13.380 --> 25:15.109
you hold on.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.202
Yes.

25:17.210 --> 25:18.575
Then what happens?

25:18.580 --> 25:21.413
We take body
and bring to deep.

25:22.790 --> 25:25.167
So no other animal
can find it.

25:25.170 --> 25:27.206
We leave it

25:27.210 --> 25:29.667
in special place.

25:31.380 --> 25:32.779
A funeral.

25:36.500 --> 25:39.492
I know I am part animal.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.992
But I am part human.

25:54.580 --> 25:55.990
[boat horn]

26:06.960 --> 26:08.746
Hey.

26:08.750 --> 26:10.706
Hi.

26:10.710 --> 26:13.031
What I said up there
about Sean,

26:13.040 --> 26:15.031
I don't want you
to think that--

26:15.040 --> 26:16.667
I didn't think anything.
I appreciate you
stickin' up for me.

26:16.670 --> 26:19.241
I wasn't stickin' up for you.

26:19.250 --> 26:22.208
It's the truth.
I meant it.

26:22.210 --> 26:26.112
I don't know when
I got so separate
from all of these guys.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.826
These men, we were
more than friends.

26:27.830 --> 26:29.821
We were family.
I was one of them.

26:29.830 --> 26:31.912
Hey.

26:33.670 --> 26:34.819
You remember this guy?

26:37.500 --> 26:39.411
I didn't know Patti
had that photo.

26:39.420 --> 26:40.614
She didn't.

26:40.620 --> 26:43.032
I put it up.

26:44.710 --> 26:46.029
I remember that kid.

26:47.830 --> 26:49.491
Strong-willed, smart,

26:49.500 --> 26:51.957
stubborn as hell.

26:51.960 --> 26:54.918
Good to see some things
haven't changed.

26:54.920 --> 26:57.616
Maybe now that you're
with the company,

26:57.620 --> 26:58.917
maybe you and I
can get back

26:58.920 --> 27:00.114
some of what we lost, too.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.918
Yeah, I'd like that.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.787
[Xander retching and coughing]

27:05.790 --> 27:07.280
You better go
keep an eye on him.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.497
[vomiting]

27:21.080 --> 27:22.490
[Xander coughing]

27:22.500 --> 27:24.491
You all right, Xan?

27:24.500 --> 27:27.822
[sobbing]

27:32.880 --> 27:34.745
Look at me.

27:34.750 --> 27:35.876
I'm here.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.110
You're not alone.

27:40.420 --> 27:42.536
Good.

27:42.540 --> 27:45.418
'Cause I feel like
I'm losm' my mind, man.

27:45.420 --> 27:47.206
I know. I know. I get it.

27:47.210 --> 27:48.279
I understand.

27:50.750 --> 27:52.286
I don't even know

27:52.290 --> 27:55.077
what's real anymore.

27:55.080 --> 27:56.411
You know?

27:58.000 --> 28:00.207
Are we always
gonna feel like this?

28:00.210 --> 28:02.701
I don't know.

28:05.750 --> 28:09.242
Hey, whatever happens,

28:09.250 --> 28:12.162
we will always be there
for each other.

28:13.790 --> 28:15.781
Yeah.

28:17.790 --> 28:20.418
Yeah, we will.

28:24.830 --> 28:28.823
[guitar playing, man singing]
Oh, we're homeward bound

28:28.830 --> 28:31.287
For a far better shore

28:31.290 --> 28:33.246
Goodbye, fare thee well

28:33.250 --> 28:36.378
Goodbye,
fare thee well

28:36.380 --> 28:38.450
The whole of the town

28:38.460 --> 28:40.997
They will open their door

28:41.000 --> 28:42.956
Hoorah, me boys

28:42.960 --> 28:45.372
We're homeward bound

28:45.380 --> 28:48.110
And when we arrive

28:48.120 --> 28:51.032
At the old Anchor Bar

28:51.040 --> 28:53.281
Goodbye, fare thee well

28:53.290 --> 28:55.997
Goodbye,
fare thee well

28:56.000 --> 28:58.286
Our families will come

28:58.290 --> 29:00.827
From near and far

29:00.830 --> 29:03.242
Hoorah, me boys

29:03.250 --> 29:05.878
We're homeward bound

29:09.040 --> 29:11.918
[applause and cheers]

29:19.040 --> 29:20.871
Where's Ryn?

29:20.880 --> 29:23.110
I don't know.
She was standing right here.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.036
Oh, no.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.530
Wait, wait, wait.

29:29.540 --> 29:31.781
It'll just draw
more attention.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.495
Hello.

29:41.210 --> 29:44.611
You're-- You're
Maddie's friend, right?

29:44.620 --> 29:46.247
Yes.

29:46.250 --> 29:47.615
[Xander] I...

29:47.620 --> 29:50.532
ran into you
just outside The Anchor

29:50.540 --> 29:51.916
a few weeks ago.

29:56.500 --> 29:57.910
I am sorry.

30:00.500 --> 30:04.288
I am sorry
for what they did.

30:04.290 --> 30:06.076
What?

30:06.080 --> 30:09.664
They kill... your father.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.116
My dad...

30:15.120 --> 30:17.031
got caught in a net.

30:17.040 --> 30:19.417
He... [quivering breath]

30:21.420 --> 30:22.660
I am sorry.

30:42.620 --> 30:44.030
Hey.

30:45.330 --> 30:46.957
We need to talk.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.951
[dog barking]

31:02.620 --> 31:04.781
What are you barkin' at?

31:04.790 --> 31:06.496
[barking]

31:08.120 --> 31:09.610
[barking]

31:11.750 --> 31:12.956
Come on! Come on, boy!

31:12.960 --> 31:14.780
Come on, hey!

31:14.790 --> 31:17.577
Come on.
Just calm down.

31:23.500 --> 31:27.163
All this time,
you've been lyin' to me?

31:27.170 --> 31:28.876
So this is
how we're gonna have
each other's backs, man?

31:28.880 --> 31:30.029
You're so full of shit!

31:30.040 --> 31:31.325
Xander, I'm sorry.

31:31.330 --> 31:32.706
You watched, man!

31:32.710 --> 31:34.780
You watched as that thing
killed my dad,

31:34.790 --> 31:36.166
and you still didn't
tell me the truth.

31:36.170 --> 31:37.455
I mean,
what is wrong with you?

31:37.460 --> 31:38.996
It wasn't just Ben,
Xanden

31:39.000 --> 31:40.911
It was me, too. We were
trying to protect her.

31:46.330 --> 31:47.957
[pounding]

31:47.960 --> 31:49.109
[crowd gasps]

31:49.120 --> 31:51.202
Stay the hell
away from me.

31:53.170 --> 31:55.115
Ben, no.

31:55.120 --> 31:57.327
He needs to cool down.

31:57.330 --> 31:58.957
Yeah.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.529
You about ready to go?

32:11.540 --> 32:13.371
Iam...

32:13.380 --> 32:14.870
but you're not.

32:17.210 --> 32:18.780
You should stay.

32:18.790 --> 32:21.031
I just have a feeling that
if you started talking to them,

32:21.040 --> 32:23.417
you would feel
like no time has passed.

32:23.420 --> 32:25.411
I want to get you home.

32:25.420 --> 32:26.819
I have two sons.

32:26.830 --> 32:28.206
I think one of them
will take pity on me.

32:33.170 --> 32:35.456
[laughter]

32:54.080 --> 32:56.878
[sea lion grunting]

32:58.080 --> 33:00.036
[barking]

33:10.250 --> 33:12.957
[sea lion barking]

33:17.460 --> 33:20.281
You're not afraid of me.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.379
[contented chirping]

33:39.580 --> 33:44.449
[groaning softly]

33:49.330 --> 33:50.911
Oh, how are you holding up?

33:50.920 --> 33:52.319
Oh, I'm a little tired.

33:55.540 --> 33:56.916
Oh.

33:58.500 --> 34:00.707
Then Sean said,
"It wasn't me!

34:00.710 --> 34:02.325
It was the cow!"

34:02.330 --> 34:04.537
[laughter]

34:07.250 --> 34:10.242
Xan, come on.
We gotta get you home.

34:13.120 --> 34:15.327
-Hi.
-Hey.

34:15.330 --> 34:17.537
I'm gonna take
my mom home.

34:17.540 --> 34:19.952
Is it okay if I meet you
back at the Center?

34:19.960 --> 34:21.780
Of course.

34:21.790 --> 34:25.032
I should have told him
the truth, Maddie.

34:25.040 --> 34:27.998
When Sean got killed,
I should have told him.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.286
We were doing
what we thought was right.

34:30.290 --> 34:32.201
Remember?
I lied to my dad, too.

34:33.290 --> 34:34.575
Yeah.

34:35.960 --> 34:38.201
I'm calling in an S.O.S.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.871
I mean,
I've tried everything.

34:39.880 --> 34:42.371
He won't talk,
he won't move.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.280
He's...

34:44.290 --> 34:46.201
I'll take care of him.

34:46.210 --> 34:47.370
You can take off,
Calvin.

34:47.380 --> 34:48.495
Thanks.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.661
I'll see you guys
tomorrow.

34:53.380 --> 34:55.325
I'll help you with Xander.

34:55.330 --> 34:56.570
Ben, no.

34:56.580 --> 34:58.377
Just
take your mom home.

34:58.380 --> 34:59.745
I can handle him.

35:01.330 --> 35:03.070
Look, I know
it's not the same,

35:03.080 --> 35:07.494
but I understand
what losing a parent
feels like.

35:07.500 --> 35:09.786
Just trust me.

35:23.540 --> 35:26.418
Your car is disgusting.

35:26.420 --> 35:28.820
I like my car.

35:28.830 --> 35:30.320
We can buy you a new one.

35:30.330 --> 35:32.207
You know,
one of those electrics?

35:32.210 --> 35:33.529
Good for the environment.

35:33.540 --> 35:35.417
Mm-hmm.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.240
I wasn't gonna say anything

35:38.250 --> 35:39.535
because of everything
that's going on,

35:39.540 --> 35:41.576
but, uh,

35:41.580 --> 35:42.615
I have some news.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.165
You know that medical trial

35:46.170 --> 35:47.535
that I've been waiting
to get into

35:47.540 --> 35:49.826
for years and years?

35:49.830 --> 35:51.661
Yeah, I remember.

35:51.670 --> 35:52.659
I'm in.

35:54.210 --> 35:56.280
-Seriously?
-[laughing] Yeah.

35:56.290 --> 35:58.451
Wow! Mom, that--

35:58.460 --> 35:59.449
That's amazing.

35:59.460 --> 36:00.745
I know!

36:00.750 --> 36:02.286
I know. I just--

36:02.290 --> 36:04.611
I feel like I have
this new lease on life.

36:04.620 --> 36:07.453
Like--
Like there's hope.

36:08.670 --> 36:09.819
What happened?

36:09.830 --> 36:11.707
Well, do you remember
that doctor

36:11.710 --> 36:14.372
from my gala last week,
Dr. Decker?

36:14.380 --> 36:15.324
Well, it was him.

36:15.330 --> 36:17.070
He was able
to pull some strings.

36:17.080 --> 36:19.457
Suddenly, I... I have hope.

36:19.460 --> 36:20.870
I have a chance, Ben.

36:34.460 --> 36:36.701
Mm-- Mm-- Wait, stop.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.700
I want to sleep in there.

36:44.960 --> 36:47.372
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.076
On my boat.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.661
Okay.

36:55.670 --> 36:56.876
I get it.

37:13.380 --> 37:15.530
Why you doin' this?

37:15.540 --> 37:17.917
Because I'm
your friend, Xander,

37:17.920 --> 37:19.456
and I care about you.

37:19.460 --> 37:22.247
No.

37:22.250 --> 37:23.319
Why are you helpin' her?

37:27.330 --> 37:28.991
Because I believe
Ryn is good.

37:30.710 --> 37:32.496
And I care about her.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.412
She's different, Xander.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.990
She's special.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.878
Maddie Bishop.

37:39.880 --> 37:41.575
Heart of gold,

37:41.580 --> 37:43.707
can see
the good in anybody.

37:46.750 --> 37:48.957
I always loved that
about you.

37:48.960 --> 37:51.076
Xander. ..

37:52.380 --> 37:53.529
please don't.

37:55.330 --> 37:58.117
It was a long time ago.

38:44.830 --> 38:47.958
[sea lion breathing]

39:01.540 --> 39:03.076
I don't understand.

39:05.420 --> 39:07.877
Now she trust Ryn.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.241
[sea lion grunts softly]

39:12.250 --> 39:14.206
[chirping]

39:29.460 --> 39:30.529
Oh, I'm...

39:30.540 --> 39:32.531
I'm so sorry.

39:34.460 --> 39:36.496
I know you're not like them.

39:44.080 --> 39:48.494
Ben. Ryn. Friend.

39:56.460 --> 39:59.031
Will you sing to me again?

40:04.830 --> 40:10.166
[singing Siren song]

40:35.710 --> 40:38.076
[screaming]

40:42.830 --> 40:45.708
[screaming and hissing]

41:23.960 --> 41:25.575
[hisses]

41:27.670 --> 41:30.742
[placid high-pitched calls]
