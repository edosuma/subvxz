01:05.230 --> 01:07.165
D'oh!

01:41.234 --> 01:43.828
Olive oil? Asparagus?

01:43.937 --> 01:45.962
If your mother wasn't so fancy...

01:46.072 --> 01:49.132
we could shop at the gas station
like normal people.

01:49.242 --> 01:51.574
I need this candy for school.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.578
- Candy class.
- Well, okay.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.274
But get five bags in case
we eat four on the way home.

01:56.382 --> 01:59.647
My teacher said I need cupcakes-
cupcakes to learn.

01:59.752 --> 02:01.652
In the cart.

02:01.754 --> 02:04.279
- I'm out of wine.
- Cart.

02:07.026 --> 02:11.156
We need these
because we have to-

02:11.264 --> 02:13.994
My doctor says-
and my garage mechanic agrees-

02:14.100 --> 02:16.000
- In the cart.
- Whoo-hoo!

02:16.102 --> 02:19.799
You know, I always felt sorry for Marge,
having to do the shopping...

02:19.906 --> 02:22.431
but this is kind of fun. Whoop.

02:22.542 --> 02:25.568
Yeah! I wish Maggie had to go
to the emergency room more often.

02:27.480 --> 02:32.008
Hmm. I never heard of a baby swallowing
a magazine before-And I'm a doctor.

02:32.118 --> 02:36.748
I don't know if it matters,
but it was a <i>Time</i> magazine.

02:36.856 --> 02:38.949
- Does that matter?
- Uh-oh.

02:39.058 --> 02:41.686
- This could be dangerous.
- What? What?

02:41.794 --> 02:44.558
Syrian hard-liners
are gaining influence.

02:49.269 --> 02:51.169
Wait. I changed my mind.

02:51.271 --> 02:55.105
- Stack it in the order I'll eat it driving home.
- Sir, please.

02:55.208 --> 02:59.406
I've already bagged it by color
and in order of each item's discovery by man.

02:59.512 --> 03:03.539
The customer's always right.
That's what everybody likes about us. Now, mush!

03:03.650 --> 03:05.618
You tell him, Jumbo.

03:05.718 --> 03:08.687
And you- Start over.
I want everything in one bag.

03:08.788 --> 03:11.757
- Yes, ma'am.
- But I don't want the bag to be heavy.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.826
I don't think that's possible.

03:13.927 --> 03:17.920
What are you,
the possible police? Just do it.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.329
Hey, hey, watch
what you're doin' there, sack monkey.

03:20.433 --> 03:22.333
You're bruising my Dura-Log.

03:22.435 --> 03:26.337
Hurry up! I can't stand here
jabbing you all day.

03:26.439 --> 03:29.806
Please- Ow! Stop.
Bag boys have feelings too, you know.

03:29.909 --> 03:33.470
- No, you don't.
- Excuse me. Is there a problem here?

03:33.580 --> 03:35.480
No, I can handle it.

03:35.582 --> 03:37.709
- I'll get you, squealer.
- Ow!

03:37.817 --> 03:41.583
Okay, that's it.
On behalf of Sack Stuffers local 199...

03:41.688 --> 03:44.714
I'm callin' a strike.

03:44.824 --> 03:47.884
- Strike! Strike! Strike!
- Strike! Strike! Strike!

03:50.663 --> 03:53.530
Oh, the bag boys are on strike.

03:53.633 --> 03:55.999
Ooh! I'm shakin'.

03:56.102 --> 03:58.536
Mr. Simpson, please,
will you go home?

03:58.638 --> 04:00.663
If I can have this rubber stick.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.475
Pledging to honor
the bag boys' strike...

04:04.577 --> 04:06.875
are the Brotherhood
of Fruit Packers and Unpackers...

04:06.980 --> 04:08.880
the Shelf-Dusters' Union...

04:08.982 --> 04:11.382
and the Unattractive Waitresses
of America.

04:11.484 --> 04:13.748
- Kiss my grits!
- Indeed.

04:13.853 --> 04:16.413
- Good luck, sir.
- No bag boys are gonna stop Lenny...

04:16.522 --> 04:18.956
from hosting a casual get-together.

04:19.058 --> 04:20.958
Casual?

04:21.060 --> 04:23.028
I can taste that get-together now.

04:23.129 --> 04:25.427
Hey! I was holding that.

04:25.531 --> 04:29.865
Next time I'll knock your hat off, scab.

04:32.972 --> 04:36.908
So hungry. There's gotta be some food left.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.639
"SulfurJerky"? "Cream ofToast"?

04:40.747 --> 04:42.715
Where do we get all this crap?

04:42.815 --> 04:45.613
Most of it was sent by relatives
who couldn't see very well.

04:45.718 --> 04:47.618
Hey, I found some eggs.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.620
The mother abandoned her nest.

04:49.722 --> 04:52.919
Aaah! Aaah!

04:55.061 --> 04:57.427
There's gotta be something
to eat in this house.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.438
Hey, the dog smells something.

05:06.539 --> 05:09.975
Good boy! Good boy!
Show us where the food is.

05:10.076 --> 05:12.874
Where? Over there?

05:15.782 --> 05:18.683
Hey!

05:25.558 --> 05:29.517
Yoinck! My old lunch box.

05:29.629 --> 05:32.894
Oh, that Amos Burke
made his own rules.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.031
Very old animal crackers!

05:38.137 --> 05:40.037
Mmm. Mmm.

05:40.139 --> 05:42.039
Homer, no!

05:42.141 --> 05:44.507
Those were made in the '60s.

05:45.611 --> 05:48.944
Mmm. Turbulent.

05:49.048 --> 05:50.948
Ow!

05:51.050 --> 05:55.316
- What the hell-
- Whoa. A solid gold animal cracker.

05:55.421 --> 06:00.552
"Find the golden giraffe, and we'll
send you and your family to Africa."

06:00.660 --> 06:03.686
Africa? They're bound
to have food there.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.560
And on my free African safari,
I wanna do everything on this box.

06:10.670 --> 06:14.128
I want to shoot a lion in the face,
fight Muhammad Ali...

06:14.240 --> 06:16.470
and ride in a convertible
with two happy zebras.

06:16.576 --> 06:19.409
Sir, that contest ended 30 years ago.

06:19.512 --> 06:21.776
We don't even make
animal crackers anymore.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.247
We make household poisons
and Christmas lights.

06:24.350 --> 06:27.547
Your box made promises
of a "vacational" nature...

06:27.653 --> 06:29.621
and I expect you to live up to them.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.519
We won't though.

06:31.624 --> 06:35.720
Sir, with all due respect, an old box
of cookies is not a legal contract.

06:35.828 --> 06:37.728
Ow! My eye!

06:37.830 --> 06:39.491
- Is that our fault?
- We're in big, big trouble.

06:39.599 --> 06:41.260
- He could sue us.
- It was defective string.

06:41.367 --> 06:43.062
Yeah, and it's got very sharp corners.

06:43.169 --> 06:47.606
- Mr. Simpson, we've decided
to make good on your vacation.
- Whoo-hoo!

06:47.707 --> 06:50.232
- Hey, mister.
- Yes?

06:50.343 --> 06:53.369
On the plane I'm gonna need two seats-

06:53.479 --> 06:55.413
for the twins.

06:57.183 --> 07:02.052
- The Simpsons are going to Africa.
- Yea!

07:05.358 --> 07:07.258
What is it, N'gungo?

07:07.360 --> 07:10.261
Evil is coming.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.263
- What shall we do, N'gungo?
- Uh-

07:12.365 --> 07:14.230
You are N'gungo now.

07:14.333 --> 07:17.131
Aaah!

07:23.409 --> 07:26.037
Africa looks like a beautiful jewel.

07:26.145 --> 07:28.670
And these musical garment bags
aren't bad either.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.681
<i>Attention, passengers.</i>

07:30.783 --> 07:33.581
Please prepare for our landing in Tanzania.

07:34.754 --> 07:38.485
I'm sorry. It is now called
"New Zanzibar."

07:38.591 --> 07:42.721
Excuse me. It is now called
"Pepsi Presents New Zanzibar."

07:45.465 --> 07:47.797
Hello. Hello, Simpsons.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.425
Welcome to Africa.

07:50.536 --> 07:53.505
- I am your guide, Kitenge.
- Hey, how ya doin'?

07:53.606 --> 07:55.665
- Hi.
- Hello.

07:55.775 --> 07:59.506
- Isn't that cute? A bush baby.
- Where?

07:59.612 --> 08:01.273
Aaah! Shoo! Shoo!

08:01.380 --> 08:04.941
Oh, man. I just bought this shirt.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.022
- Who's Muntu?
- He is our leader.

08:16.128 --> 08:20.428
He seized power in a bloodless coup-
all smotherings.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.763
Just likeJimmy Carter.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.901
Okay. You'll be sleeping here tonight.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.907
On the ground?

08:30.009 --> 08:32.273
No, Mom.

08:32.378 --> 08:34.744
Ohh.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.815
I will come down for your bags.

08:36.916 --> 08:39.817
That's okay. I got 'em.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.620
Eh. Bound to happen.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.157
Help! Ugh!

08:53.266 --> 08:55.461
This mosquito net's not working.

08:55.568 --> 08:59.095
No, no. You have it inside out.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.730
There.

09:01.841 --> 09:03.934
When do we get to see the animals?

09:04.043 --> 09:09.845
In the morning, little one. Now, good night,
and don't let the bedbugs paralyze.

09:11.150 --> 09:13.380
Homie, did you remember to tip Kitenge?

09:13.486 --> 09:15.386
No, he did not.

09:17.456 --> 09:20.289
All right! I got another one.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.759
Hey, you didn't see a warthog.

09:22.862 --> 09:24.762
I'm looking at one right now.

09:24.864 --> 09:27.594
Mom! Bart implied I was a warthog.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.668
<i>Nobody's a warthog.</i>

09:29.769 --> 09:31.669
What about him?

09:31.771 --> 09:34.433
Aaah!

09:38.144 --> 09:42.012
Oh, look, everybody.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.154
<i>Wow!</i>

09:50.256 --> 09:53.282
It just rolled over to 10,000.

09:59.832 --> 10:04.360
Now we sit quietly and wait
for nature to unveil herself.

10:11.711 --> 10:14.407
Wait. Rhinos don't come from eggs.

10:14.513 --> 10:17.607
- What did you just see, Lisa?
- I know, but-

10:17.717 --> 10:20.413
- What did you just see?
- Hmph.

10:23.322 --> 10:25.119
Oh, now, come on.

10:25.224 --> 10:28.091
Look, Mother, by that tree- Cheetah.

10:28.194 --> 10:32.597
Mmm. He doesn't look so fast to me.

10:45.211 --> 10:49.614
- Take it, Homer.
- # Glibby glup gloopy, Nibby nobby nooby #

10:49.715 --> 10:51.410
# La lee lo, lo, lo ##

10:51.517 --> 10:54.816
What? What is it?

10:54.920 --> 10:57.354
Mmm. Poachers.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.792
That's terrible.

11:03.896 --> 11:08.094
Now, honey, poachers are
nature's way of keeping the balance.

11:08.200 --> 11:12.068
Whenever there are so many species
that people get confused and angry...

11:12.171 --> 11:14.071
a poacher is born.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.198
I don't care. I hate them.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.703
Let's get out of here!

11:23.182 --> 11:26.709
They'll be back.
They left their cargo pants.

11:30.790 --> 11:33.623
This is the earliest known
fossil of a human being.

11:33.726 --> 11:36.559
It's over two million years old.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.060
I've got more bones than that guy.

11:41.167 --> 11:44.000
If you're trying
to impress me, you've failed.

11:44.103 --> 11:45.866
It's not the number of bones, sir.

11:45.971 --> 11:47.871
- It's the-
- You have failed.

11:53.179 --> 11:56.239
The Maasai chief
welcomes you to his village.

11:56.348 --> 12:01.012
Oh, thank you.
Your ground is so comfortable.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.452
By the way, what kind of blood is this?

12:03.556 --> 12:07.652
Cow.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.127
<i>Hey, Mom. Look what Mbali gave me.</i>

12:11.230 --> 12:13.926
Hey, check it out.

12:14.033 --> 12:18.163
- <i>Bart! I told you not to get your lip "disked. '"</i>
- All right.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.397
Uh-oh.

12:26.345 --> 12:29.803
That's it! Get into a frenzy. Aha!

12:32.818 --> 12:35.787
Whoo!

12:38.357 --> 12:41.292
This song has been
going on for hours.

12:41.393 --> 12:43.987
Yeah. It's like the Allman Brothers.

12:44.096 --> 12:49.295
Homer, no!

12:49.401 --> 12:51.460
Aaah!

12:51.570 --> 12:54.664
A hungry, hungry hippo. Aaah!

12:54.774 --> 12:57.504
Help! Kitenge!

12:59.812 --> 13:03.043
Now, Simpsons! Run for it.

13:03.149 --> 13:05.117
Huh?

13:09.021 --> 13:13.185
Good old Kitenge.

13:17.329 --> 13:19.229
Aaah!

13:20.633 --> 13:22.533
Quick! Into the river.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.035
- Hippos hate water.
- No, they don't. They-Aaah!

13:32.645 --> 13:35.136
<i>Shaka Zulu!</i>

13:35.247 --> 13:38.444
- Which way should we go?
- Mmm-

13:38.551 --> 13:40.781
Hmm.

13:40.886 --> 13:42.444
Mmm.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.113
Hmm.

13:44.223 --> 13:45.747
Hmm?

13:45.858 --> 13:47.325
Hmm.

13:47.426 --> 13:51.157
The left! Go to the left!

13:52.665 --> 13:55.099
It's working. Aaah! Leeches!

13:55.201 --> 13:57.135
Aaah!

13:59.238 --> 14:01.035
Uh-oh.

14:14.053 --> 14:16.021
Okay, here's the situation.

14:16.121 --> 14:18.817
We're hopelessly lost
and about to die.

14:20.559 --> 14:22.993
Don't worry.

14:23.095 --> 14:24.995
Being eaten by a crocodile...

14:25.097 --> 14:28.032
is just like going to sleep...
in a giant blender.

14:28.133 --> 14:30.033
Wonder where this river goes.

14:30.135 --> 14:32.000
I've got a map.

14:32.104 --> 14:33.628
Monkey.

14:33.739 --> 14:37.698
Now, according to animal crackers,
there's no river here.

14:37.810 --> 14:40.404
- Eh-
- Stay in the boat, Homer.

14:45.284 --> 14:48.447
Look.

14:58.197 --> 15:01.792
Let's just float by quietly.

15:10.542 --> 15:13.511
Oh. You think they settled
that bag boy strike yet?

15:13.612 --> 15:18.072
Oh, no. We're headed for Victoria Falls.

15:19.818 --> 15:22.514
Here's why they shouldn't
get anything. One-

15:29.595 --> 15:31.495
Whoo!

15:31.597 --> 15:34.464
This flower saved our lives.

15:34.566 --> 15:37.399
Oh, no. It's eating us.

15:37.503 --> 15:39.562
<i>Not a chance.</i>

15:40.706 --> 15:42.640
Wow, Dad. How did you do that?

15:42.741 --> 15:44.641
It's a flower.

15:46.745 --> 15:49.942
Are we insane yet?
Are we insane yet? Are we insane yet?

15:50.049 --> 15:51.949
I told you, yes. Now-

15:52.051 --> 15:56.078
Bart, go to the top of that hill
and see if you can spot our hotel.

15:56.188 --> 15:58.088
<i>Mt. Kilimanjaro?</i>

15:58.190 --> 16:00.590
- Go!
- Okay.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.923
Aaah!

16:03.028 --> 16:05.792
- A chimp.
- Hello, little fella.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.923
Hey, maybe he'll lead us to bananas.

16:08.033 --> 16:10.399
Or more mouthwatering monkeys.

16:10.502 --> 16:12.868
- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
- Overtime for bag boys?

16:12.972 --> 16:14.872
Ridiculous!

16:19.845 --> 16:22.678
This is the place I've read about-

16:22.781 --> 16:25.375
where Dr. Bushwell
lives among the chimps.

16:25.484 --> 16:29.011
Oh, isn't that sweet?
He named it after his wife.

16:29.121 --> 16:31.021
No, Dr. Bushwell is a woman.

16:31.123 --> 16:33.023
Well, now I've heard everything.

16:35.094 --> 16:37.824
It's kind of you
to take us in, Dr. Bushwell.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.865
- Yeah. Thanks for the grub.
- Grubs.

16:40.966 --> 16:42.991
Whatever.

16:43.102 --> 16:45.002
Ah, there's a burst of flavor.

16:45.104 --> 16:47.868
Your work has really inspired me, Doctor-

16:47.973 --> 16:50.168
And I love your sensible ponytail.

16:50.275 --> 16:54.302
Well, thank you.
See, Jojo? <i>She</i> likes it.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.711
So I notice your home smells of feces.

16:58.817 --> 17:01.581
- Yes?
- And not just monkey feces either.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.383
Could we talk about something else?

17:04.490 --> 17:07.357
L-I love what you've done
with these poles.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.528
Every day I get up at 5:30,
watch the chimps...

17:17.636 --> 17:21.071
eat a quick lunch of roots and water,
then more chimp-watching.

17:21.173 --> 17:24.540
After dark I come home and think
about chimps until it's time for bed.

17:24.643 --> 17:28.409
- You must be the most boring woman on earth.
- Possibly, but-

17:28.513 --> 17:32.974
- I mean, I knew scientists
wasted their lives, but geez!
- Homer!

17:33.085 --> 17:36.543
What? What is it, Pointy?

17:47.866 --> 17:49.891
Oh, no. It's the poachers.

17:50.002 --> 17:52.971
Give us the chimps,
and no one gets hurt.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.006
Absolutely not!

17:55.107 --> 17:57.007
Will you help me defend the refuge?

17:57.109 --> 17:59.475
Anything for these noble animals.

18:04.049 --> 18:05.949
So like us.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.283
Huh?

18:13.392 --> 18:15.883
- What?
- Aaah!

18:15.994 --> 18:18.258
Yes! Aaah!

18:30.042 --> 18:31.976
Somebody light this monkey.

18:32.077 --> 18:34.978
Aaah! Help! Bad monkey.

18:42.488 --> 18:45.685
Hey! Stop it, you creep.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.060
- Greenpeace?
- That's right.

18:50.162 --> 18:53.427
And we're not leaving
till we rescue every animal here.

18:53.532 --> 18:55.932
Well, if you really
cared about chimps...

18:56.034 --> 18:59.231
you'd know that Dr. Bushwell
is their best friend.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.636
Oh, is that right?

19:01.740 --> 19:04.436
Why don't you tell her
about the diamond mine, Doctor?

19:04.543 --> 19:07.478
Diamond mine?
What are you talking about?

19:07.579 --> 19:09.604
I'm talking about this.

19:18.123 --> 19:21.752
The chimps are running a diamond mine.

19:22.861 --> 19:25.421
Why, what fascinating behavior.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.999
L-I must document this new activity.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.602
Dr. Bushwell!

19:31.703 --> 19:34.433
What, these?
Well, they were a graduation present.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.338
Unbelievable.

19:37.442 --> 19:40.206
This shaft must be five miles deep.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.555
<i>Oh, for- Lookit. There's more over here.</i>

19:52.658 --> 19:54.990
Look at this.
She's hidden diamonds everywhere.

19:55.093 --> 19:57.527
Even on the soles of her shoes.

19:57.629 --> 20:02.999
Yep. She's one of the 10 richest
chimp researchers in the world.

20:03.101 --> 20:05.626
Look at me! I'm a scientist.

20:05.737 --> 20:09.366
Africa.

20:09.474 --> 20:13.535
How could you exploit
your beloved chimps like this?

20:13.645 --> 20:17.638
I think we should look at her research
before we condemn her entirely.

20:19.084 --> 20:21.712
I haven't said anything for a while.

20:22.821 --> 20:24.914
Hmm.

20:25.023 --> 20:28.686
These are just pictures of monkeys
from famous movies.

20:28.794 --> 20:31.991
This is disgraceful, Doctor.

20:32.097 --> 20:34.565
All right, so I snapped.

20:34.666 --> 20:37.931
You don't understand
the crushing loneliness and greed.

20:38.036 --> 20:40.095
Don't worry, Doctor.

20:40.205 --> 20:42.673
We'll get you all the help you need.

20:42.774 --> 20:44.833
No! Don't put me away.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.740
I'll give you diamonds.
Everybody wants diamonds.

20:48.847 --> 20:51.008
Diamonds will make
everything all better.

20:51.116 --> 20:53.778
Diamonds! Diamonds!

20:58.156 --> 21:01.091
- What a nice lady.
- Very nice.

21:01.193 --> 21:05.095
- Hey, Lise, check it out. Diamond vision.
- Buzz off.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.961
Hey, look. Our tour guide got a new job.

21:08.066 --> 21:09.931
<i>Mmm, quite a promotion.</i>

21:10.035 --> 21:12.060
I was wondering what became of him.

21:12.170 --> 21:14.104
What happened to President Muntu?

21:14.206 --> 21:16.140
I don't want to talk about it.

21:20.512 --> 21:22.844
<i>He got overthrown!</i>

21:24.650 --> 21:27.847
<i>Now he's just a stinkin'flight attendant.</i>

21:27.953 --> 21:29.887
<i>Hey, where's my pillow?</i>

22:24.409 --> 22:26.309
Shh!

22:27.305 --> 22:33.768
