00:02.045 --> 00:04.308
Hi. Tammy, alcoholic.GROUP: Hi, Tammy.

00:04.352 --> 00:06.658
Whew. I'm still
a little rattled.

00:06.702 --> 00:09.139
I'm standing in line
at the salad bar today,

00:09.183 --> 00:11.707
and there's this cop behind me.

00:11.750 --> 00:14.449
So, of course, fresh out
of jail, I get paranoid.

00:14.492 --> 00:18.888
My hands start shaking,
chickpeas rolling off the plate.

00:18.931 --> 00:21.673
Freaked me out so much,
I left without getting

00:21.717 --> 00:23.197
any of those
itty-bitty corncobs,

00:23.240 --> 00:24.981
which is
the whole reason I went.

00:25.025 --> 00:28.593
I mean, am I gonna spend
the rest of my life

00:28.637 --> 00:31.422
looking over my shoulder, afraid
they're gonna lock me up again?

00:31.466 --> 00:34.077
I can't go back to jail.

00:34.121 --> 00:37.167
There's no tiny corn there.

00:37.211 --> 00:39.691
And people stab you.

00:39.735 --> 00:42.738
Anyway, thanks.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.481
Would anyone else
like to share?

00:46.524 --> 00:48.396
Hi. Christy, alcoholic.

00:48.439 --> 00:49.919
GROUP:
Hi, Christy.

00:49.962 --> 00:52.878
I was so not planning on
coming to the meeting today.

00:52.922 --> 00:55.751
I mean, I had no school,
no work,

00:55.794 --> 00:58.014
and all I wanted to do
was lie on the couch

00:58.058 --> 01:00.538
and binge-watch Chopped.

01:00.582 --> 01:03.106
P.S. I would be great
on that show.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.761
I can't tell you how many times
I've opened up the fridge

01:05.804 --> 01:08.938
and all I had was gummy bears,
tortillas and mustard.

01:08.981 --> 01:12.028
That was a challenging
Thanksgiving.

01:12.072 --> 01:15.988
But next thing I knew,
I was putting my shoes on,

01:16.032 --> 01:18.904
getting in the car
and driving here.

01:18.948 --> 01:21.516
I can't believe it;
I have sober feet.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.562
They know where
I'm supposed to be,

01:24.606 --> 01:26.347
even when I don't
want to be there.

01:27.826 --> 01:29.132
Sober feet.

01:31.003 --> 01:32.962
Anyway, that's all.

01:33.005 --> 01:34.964
Really glad to be here.

01:37.140 --> 01:38.837
Anyone else?
I'll go.

01:38.881 --> 01:41.013
Hi. Bonnie, alcoholic.GROUP: Hi, Bonnie.

01:41.057 --> 01:44.147
Well, my fiancÃ©'s bar has
finally turned a corner.

01:44.191 --> 01:47.019
So, with Adam busy,
I have a lot of time to myself,

01:47.063 --> 01:48.543
which, when I drank,
could be dangerous,

01:48.586 --> 01:49.979
but now is kind of nice.

01:50.022 --> 01:53.243
I can eat what I want,
see any movie I want.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.680
By golly, for the first time
in my life,

01:55.724 --> 01:57.334
I get to be a little selfish.

01:57.378 --> 01:59.380
Too easy.

02:02.339 --> 02:04.254
Come on.
"Sober feet."

02:04.298 --> 02:07.127
That's recovery
gold right there.

02:07.170 --> 02:09.433
But I look over at
Nora, I get nothing.

02:09.477 --> 02:12.088
Not a smile, not a wink,
not even a finger gun.

02:13.611 --> 02:16.658
You know, sweetie,
needy's not a good color on you.

02:16.701 --> 02:19.661
It's not needy to
want an "attaboy"

02:19.704 --> 02:21.489
from my sponsor
once in a while.

02:21.532 --> 02:24.100
I always give my sponsees
my full attention.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.582
Oh, please. You slept through
my entire share last week.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.497
I was meditating.

02:29.540 --> 02:33.109
Is your secret mantra,
"I'm awake"?

02:34.197 --> 02:35.981
Spot-on, Big Sauce.
She does the same thing

02:36.025 --> 02:37.896
when we're at home
watching Blue Bloods.

02:37.940 --> 02:40.247
Well, it's the only way
I can get you to stop talking.

02:40.290 --> 02:43.989
I do get chatty when
Donnie Wahlberg's on camera.

02:44.033 --> 02:47.036
I just have a feeling
he's a fascinating person.

02:49.778 --> 02:52.781
All right, coffee pot is clean.
I'm out of here.

02:52.824 --> 02:56.001
Hey, Nora!

02:56.045 --> 02:58.395
Awesome share.

02:58.439 --> 03:01.572
I always get so much out
of what you have to say.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.095
Thanks.

03:04.749 --> 03:06.838
Well, that was hard to watch.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.405
She knows how it works.

03:08.449 --> 03:10.102
"Hey, I liked your share."

03:10.146 --> 03:11.843
"Thanks.
I liked your share, too."

03:11.887 --> 03:13.628
Well, I liked
your share today.

03:13.671 --> 03:15.934
Thank you, Wendy.
I liked your share, too.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.022
I didn't share.

03:17.066 --> 03:19.460
Oh.

03:19.503 --> 03:22.071
Attaboy.

03:46.138 --> 03:48.097
Oh!

03:48.140 --> 03:50.578
What's the body
count so far?

03:50.621 --> 03:52.884
Well, assuming that cheerleader
can't sew her head back on,

03:52.928 --> 03:54.930
we're up to five.: Yeah.

03:54.973 --> 03:58.890
Her head's on the floor, but her
hands still think she's alive.

03:58.934 --> 04:00.240
CHRISTY:
Is it safe to look now?

04:00.283 --> 04:02.329
Hang on.

04:02.372 --> 04:03.852
All clear.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.074
You guys suck!

04:09.118 --> 04:11.642
The-the jock gets
it in the jockstrap.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.470
Now, that's good writing.

04:13.514 --> 04:14.471
Mm.

04:14.515 --> 04:16.560
Unbelievable.What?

04:16.604 --> 04:19.433
I texted Nora an hour ago,
and she still hasn't responded.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.043
So I paused the movie

04:21.086 --> 04:22.218
for something that
didn't actually happen?

04:22.262 --> 04:23.567
Yeah.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.700
Why are you so obsessed
with Nora's approval?

04:25.743 --> 04:27.397
I mean, is it 'cause
she's famous or something?

04:27.441 --> 04:30.052
She's not famous; she does
the weather for the local news.

04:30.095 --> 04:33.229
And cohosts the Napa Valley
Thanksgiving Day Parade.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.101
It's on two channels.

04:36.145 --> 04:38.016
Christy's always been
an approval junkie.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.236
In high school, if there was
one person in her class

04:40.280 --> 04:42.630
that didn't like her,
that's who she'd have sex with.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.327
Hey, it worked.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.460
You should take a page
from the Book of Bonnie.

04:46.503 --> 04:47.896
She never cares
what people think.

04:47.939 --> 04:48.897
She should.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.943
See, you say that;
don't care.

04:55.077 --> 04:56.644
Oh, look, it's Nora.

04:56.687 --> 04:57.819
She called you?

04:57.862 --> 04:59.124
Relax. It's Jill.

04:59.168 --> 05:00.952
What's up?

05:00.996 --> 05:04.260
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.957
Are you okay?

05:06.001 --> 05:07.437
What happened?

05:07.481 --> 05:09.134
Someone broke into her house.
Uh, we're on our way.

05:09.178 --> 05:12.486
Okay, listen, if the
police ask any questions,

05:12.529 --> 05:14.749
I was here with you all night
watching movies.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.620
You werewatching
a movie with us.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.666
Oh, good, say it
just like that.

05:22.017 --> 05:24.454
I just keep thinking, if I'd
gotten home ten minutes earlier,

05:24.498 --> 05:26.151
maybe they still
would've been in here.

05:26.195 --> 05:28.284
I could be lying
on the floor dead.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.896
But your hands don't know it
yet, so they're still twitching.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.115
Quit it.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.989
We're just glad you're okay.
What'd they get?

05:38.033 --> 05:40.296
Oh, all the jewelry
that wasn't in the safe

05:40.340 --> 05:42.646
and everything from
the loose cash bowl.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.474
The what?You know how you have

05:44.518 --> 05:46.389
a bowl with loose pennies
and buttons in it?

05:46.433 --> 05:48.217
Jill does that with 20s and 50s.

05:48.260 --> 05:52.221
It's for tips, trick-or-treaters
or Mormons.

05:53.527 --> 05:55.093
How much was in there?

05:55.137 --> 05:58.575
I don't know,
couple of inches?

05:58.619 --> 06:00.229
I can't find the milk.

06:00.272 --> 06:02.405
Oh, my God,
those bastards took the milk.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.189
MAN :
Ms. Kendall?

06:04.233 --> 06:05.974
In the kitchen!

06:06.017 --> 06:07.584
MAN:
Big house. Doesn't help.

06:07.628 --> 06:11.066
Follow my voice, follow
my voice, follow my voice!

06:12.589 --> 06:15.287
All right, checked
the whole property. It's clear.

06:15.331 --> 06:16.550
Thank you, Officer.

06:16.593 --> 06:18.116
No problem.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.683
Sir, just so you know,
I'm on parole.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.642
But I have an alibi;
I was with them

06:21.685 --> 06:23.252
watching slasher movies
all night.

06:23.295 --> 06:25.646
Oh. Yeah, those are fun,

06:25.689 --> 06:28.431
till you walk in on
a real crime scene.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.651
I bet you've seen
some messed-up stuff.

06:30.694 --> 06:34.132
I don't like to talk
about it, but no.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.873
This is Napa Valley.

06:35.917 --> 06:38.920
People call 911 when they
get a bad wedge of brie.

06:38.963 --> 06:40.487
Oh, I love brie.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.663
All right, here's my card.

06:42.706 --> 06:44.665
Give me a call tomorrow with
a list of what's gone missing,

06:44.708 --> 06:45.666
you know, for your insurance.

06:45.709 --> 06:46.841
Thank you.

06:46.884 --> 06:50.714
Oh, and, uh, I, uh...

06:50.758 --> 06:52.150
I just got
one more question for you.

06:52.194 --> 06:54.892
Um, is that a Kalamazoo grill
in the backyard?

06:54.936 --> 06:56.807
I don't know.
My ex-husband put it in.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.243
I don't touch the thing.

06:58.287 --> 07:00.768
How can...

07:03.031 --> 07:04.989
How can you not...

07:05.033 --> 07:07.470
I'm sorry. It's just,
when I buy a lottery ticket,

07:07.514 --> 07:09.559
that grill is
what I'm dreaming of.

07:09.603 --> 07:12.519
You can burn wood,
charcoal, gas, or-or...

07:12.562 --> 07:14.390
you can go infrared.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.481
Infrared.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.441
You're getting a little
worked up here, Officer.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.007
It's just sitting there!

07:23.051 --> 07:25.183
Well, good thing they
didn't steal that.

07:25.227 --> 07:26.794
Okay.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.535
You can't steal it;
it's built-in.

07:28.578 --> 07:29.623
I'm sorry.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.581
You ladies, have a,
have a good night.

07:34.192 --> 07:36.238
It's a left,
two rights and a left.

07:36.281 --> 07:39.371
Copy that.

07:39.415 --> 07:42.418
Well, thanks again for coming,
but I think I'm okay now.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.941
Yeah. Unless they
come back.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.247
What?

07:45.290 --> 07:46.683
Why would you say that?

07:46.727 --> 07:47.945
It happens all the time.

07:47.989 --> 07:49.251
I mean, now that the guy
knows the layout,

07:49.294 --> 07:50.513
he could get a couple buddies,
come back,

07:50.557 --> 07:52.297
toss this place
like a Caesar salad.

07:52.341 --> 07:55.257
Tammy!I'm sorry! You're right.
It could be a chick.

07:58.260 --> 08:01.350
I really appreciate
you guys spending the night.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.442
I still think you could've
made room for me up there.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.531
I still think, while you're
down there, you can rub my feet.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.970
Bonnie, would you please
check the windows again?

08:13.014 --> 08:14.494
Sure.

08:17.584 --> 08:20.630
Back.
Damn it.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.023
You know, we can't
sleep here every night.

08:22.066 --> 08:23.503
Speak for yourself.

08:23.546 --> 08:27.768
This mattress is taking on
the shape of my ass.

08:27.811 --> 08:28.986
It's memory foam.

08:29.030 --> 08:31.423
Well, I want to marry it.

08:31.467 --> 08:33.338
Maybe you should hire
some security, you know,

08:33.382 --> 08:35.602
someone to stay here
till you get over the yips.

08:35.645 --> 08:36.820
How 'bout that cop?

08:36.864 --> 08:38.561
A lot of those guys
do off-duty work.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.258
Mm, I don't know.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.565
He wouldn't shut up
about my barbecue.

08:42.609 --> 08:45.612
I mean, what man
notices that and not me?

08:45.655 --> 08:48.179
You're right, don't call a cop.
Call a Hells Angel.

08:48.223 --> 08:52.619
They know how to crack heads and
appreciate a pretty lady.

08:52.662 --> 08:56.013
Shh, shh, shh!
Did you just hear that?

08:56.057 --> 08:58.407
Jill, the alarm's on,
you're surrounded by us,

08:58.450 --> 09:00.627
and Christy's closest to the
door-- they'll get her first.

09:00.670 --> 09:03.891
The hell they will!

09:06.937 --> 09:09.940
Geez, shave your legs
once in a while!

09:11.986 --> 09:13.944
Okay, if this
is gonna work,

09:13.988 --> 09:15.990
everybody has to
sleep on their side.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.695
Flip the dolphin, Tam.Oh, sure, sure.

09:31.309 --> 09:33.529
What's this?

09:33.573 --> 09:35.400
Warm brown food?

09:35.444 --> 09:37.446
I'm in.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.929
Appears to be
some sort of chili.

09:44.453 --> 09:46.760
Yep, chili.

09:46.803 --> 09:50.111
Hey! What are you
doing, you big moose?!

09:50.154 --> 09:51.765
You just walk in

09:51.808 --> 09:53.418
and eat anything
that's cooking on the stove?

09:53.462 --> 09:55.333
It's kept me
alive so far.

09:55.377 --> 09:57.727
Well, it's not for you.
It's for Nora.

09:57.771 --> 09:59.686
I did a little snooping around
on Instagram;

09:59.729 --> 10:01.339
found out
it's her favorite thing.

10:01.383 --> 10:03.733
Oh, my God, you're
making chili for Nora

10:03.777 --> 10:05.213
just so she'll like you.

10:05.256 --> 10:06.954
Hey, I used to
make you screwdrivers

10:06.997 --> 10:08.433
to get you to like me.

10:08.477 --> 10:13.221
You did have a good firm
pour for an eight-year-old.

10:13.264 --> 10:15.353
I really think
this is gonna work.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.617
I can almost feel her
loving me already.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.836
You're really quite
pathetic, do you know that?

10:19.880 --> 10:21.882
I've never denied it.

10:27.714 --> 10:30.151
Excuse me.

10:30.194 --> 10:32.849
I'm paying you to protect
me, not to sit here watching

10:32.893 --> 10:35.896
six tiny black-and-white
movies at the same time.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.770
You figured out those are the
security cameras I set up, yeah?

10:40.814 --> 10:43.947
Halfway through.

10:43.991 --> 10:47.690
What's going on there?
Those squirrels fighting?

10:47.734 --> 10:49.692
Oh. Oh.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.870
Yeah, they've been
going at it hot and heavy.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.219
Definitely not married.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.095
You know, you don't have to
keep bringing your own food.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.140
You're welcome to
anything in the fridge.
Oh.

11:03.184 --> 11:05.926
Thanks, but years
of police work tell me

11:05.969 --> 11:07.710
there's probably less
than a thousand calories

11:07.754 --> 11:08.972
in this entire house.

11:09.016 --> 11:11.322
Oh, really?

11:16.153 --> 11:18.808
I got to ask you a
question, Ms. Kendall.

11:18.852 --> 11:22.029
Oh, you've seen me
without makeup; call me Jill.

11:22.072 --> 11:24.727
You've seen me without makeup;
call me Andy.

11:24.771 --> 11:27.034
Great, Andy. Ask away.

11:27.077 --> 11:31.038
This is a huge house,
and you're just one person.

11:31.081 --> 11:33.344
Don't you think you'd feel safer
in a smaller place?

11:33.388 --> 11:36.521
Maybe.

11:36.565 --> 11:39.960
But I've just been here so long,
I guess I'm kind of used to it.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.311
And my ex wanted it
in the divorce,

11:43.354 --> 11:45.748
so I cried until the judge
said I could have it.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.576
Mm.

11:47.619 --> 11:51.754
Yeah, my ex did the same thing
with my Raiders tickets.

11:51.798 --> 11:54.017
And she doesn't even go.

11:54.061 --> 11:56.585
It's painful enough
trying to watch a Raiders game.

11:56.628 --> 11:58.587
Now I got to turn it on and see

11:58.630 --> 12:00.894
those two empty seats
in the end zone.

12:00.937 --> 12:04.549
Oh, that's nothing.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.856
Does your ex have
a beautiful young wife

12:06.900 --> 12:08.858
and an okay-looking child?

12:08.902 --> 12:11.513
No. She's dating
another bald cop

12:11.556 --> 12:15.473
who could stand
to lose 20 pounds.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.867
What was wrong with me?

12:17.911 --> 12:20.870
I'm done being on Team Sad.

12:20.914 --> 12:23.568
I been through
all four stages of grief:

12:23.612 --> 12:26.441
eating, crying,
drinking, snorting.

12:26.484 --> 12:29.444
I been down that path.

12:29.487 --> 12:31.489
Got stuck on eating.

12:33.187 --> 12:34.710
Want a bite?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.886
Nah.

12:36.930 --> 12:39.759
I'm not eating bread,
cheese or meat right now.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.499
Watch your fingers.
Oh.

12:47.723 --> 12:49.377
Hey, what are you doing?

12:49.420 --> 12:51.945
I was watching...
whatever that was.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.947
I want to watch
the weather.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.383
We live in California.

12:55.426 --> 12:58.995
Here's your five-day
forecast: Nice.

12:59.039 --> 13:01.955
Oh, wait. You want to watch
Nora so you can tell her

13:01.998 --> 13:04.261
how much you love the way
she points at things.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.177
Suck-up.

13:07.221 --> 13:09.005
Am not.

13:09.049 --> 13:11.660
Did I get a text saying
how much she loved my chili?

13:11.703 --> 13:13.009
Yes, I did.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.881
She even asked
how my day was going.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.839
Is that the sound
of the ice queen cracking?

13:16.883 --> 13:18.580
I think so.

13:18.623 --> 13:21.017
Are you gonna ask questions
and also answer them?

13:21.061 --> 13:22.279
Is that your new thing?

13:22.323 --> 13:25.500
Is it? I don't know.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.197
Shh, shh!
My new bestie's on.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.198
NORA:
Ah, thanks, Rob!

13:28.242 --> 13:30.244
And I agree, that is some tie.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.247
Well, looks like we might need

13:33.290 --> 13:34.726
to break out the sweaters,
folks.

13:34.770 --> 13:36.467
Temperatures will be
cooling down this week

13:36.511 --> 13:38.295
thanks to winds coming in
from the west.

13:45.128 --> 13:48.131
Hey, you and your chili
just got a shout-out.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.662
: âª Winds coming in
from the west âª

13:57.706 --> 13:59.795
âª Winds coming in from
the west âª

13:59.839 --> 14:01.884
âª Winds coming in
from the west... âª

14:01.928 --> 14:03.843
600,000 views!

14:03.886 --> 14:07.063
The minute I saw this, I said,
"Let's make a YouTube video."

14:07.107 --> 14:10.327
And Christy's all, "No, we
can't humiliate my sponsor."

14:10.371 --> 14:13.069
Once again, my daughter
holds me back from greatness!

14:14.114 --> 14:15.376
I feel sorry for her.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.204
Okay, when did
you let one rip?

14:17.247 --> 14:18.683
High school talent show.

14:18.727 --> 14:21.556
I was playing the flute,
but not nearly loud enough.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.167
Move over, sex
with Abe Lincoln.

14:24.211 --> 14:26.256
That is now number one
on my time machine list.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.345
Man, poor Nora.

14:28.389 --> 14:29.869
Let's watch it again.

14:31.958 --> 14:35.396
Seriously, there's a 5% chance
they're laughing at Wendy.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.833
We both know who
they're laughing at.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.226
Here's your Tupperware.

14:39.269 --> 14:40.140
I'm so sorry.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.706
Well, don't be.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.187
Am I feeling a little
embarrassed? Absolutely.

14:44.231 --> 14:47.495
I'm human and I frickin'
farted on TV.

14:47.538 --> 14:49.236
And do you want
to talk about that?

14:49.279 --> 14:50.498
Not with you.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.500
I'll bring it to my sponsor,
who, by the way,

14:52.543 --> 14:54.676
I'm also not buddies with.

14:54.719 --> 14:56.721
Thank you for the coffee.
I got to go.

14:56.765 --> 14:58.810
Right. Well,
maybe we should--

14:58.854 --> 15:01.335
Okay. All right. Bye!

15:01.378 --> 15:04.468
Marjorie, give me
my phone back.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.993
How did you get from
farts to cat videos?

15:07.036 --> 15:09.517
How's Nora?

15:09.560 --> 15:12.172
Our friendship is dead,
and here's the murder weapon.

15:12.215 --> 15:14.130
I just don't get
what the big deal is.

15:14.174 --> 15:16.916
We all do it. We burp,
we fart, we pee when we laugh,

15:16.959 --> 15:19.135
which only makes us laugh more,
which makes us pee more.

15:19.179 --> 15:20.920
Circle of life.

15:20.963 --> 15:23.357
Ooh, motion sensor alert.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.621
Aw, look.
Andy's bringing in my mail.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.753
How long you gonna
keep him around?

15:28.797 --> 15:31.365
I don't know.
He makes me feel safe.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.149
And he's a lot of fun.

15:33.193 --> 15:34.846
We stayed up all night
just gabbing.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.979
He told me stories
about being a Marine.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.112
He really knows
how to take care of business.

15:39.155 --> 15:41.853
Yeah? Did he take care
of your business?

15:41.897 --> 15:43.290
While you were
gabbing all night?

15:43.333 --> 15:44.726
Uh-huh.

15:44.769 --> 15:47.120
Girl!

15:47.163 --> 15:50.384
He's a great guy, but
you met him; he's not my type.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.299
I don't know.
He brought in your mail.

15:52.342 --> 15:53.822
Yeah, he did.

15:53.865 --> 15:55.867
Girl!

15:55.911 --> 15:57.913
Wendy, it's not working.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.567
I know.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.484
Okay, here are the keys
to your new locks.

16:03.527 --> 16:05.442
Motion detectors are up,
cameras are working,

16:05.486 --> 16:07.009
and I think
the squirrels got married.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.968
How can you tell?

16:09.011 --> 16:11.405
They're just eating in silence
next to each other.

16:13.581 --> 16:16.453
You sure you can't stay
one more night?

16:16.497 --> 16:19.848
At this point, I'd just be
taking your money. You're safe.

16:19.891 --> 16:21.328
I don't know how to thank you.

16:21.371 --> 16:22.764
Promise me one thing.

16:22.807 --> 16:25.332
I know, I know. I got to use
that big fancy grill.

16:25.375 --> 16:28.422
I was gonna say please be sure
to set your alarm, but, yeah,

16:28.465 --> 16:30.424
I will sleep better at night
knowing you finally

16:30.467 --> 16:33.383
tossed a rib eye
on that magnificent bastard.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.561
Bye.Bye.

16:39.172 --> 16:41.913
BOTH:
Girl!

16:41.957 --> 16:44.090
Oh, stop.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.700
Let's just start
watching the movie.

16:45.743 --> 16:47.267
I think we just
watched one.Mm-hmm.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.790
A little
romantic comedy

16:48.833 --> 16:50.748
about the lonely rich
girl and her bodyguard.

16:52.402 --> 16:56.537
âª And I-ee-I...

16:56.580 --> 17:01.237
âª Will always
love you-ooh-ooh... âª

17:01.281 --> 17:03.022
All right, knock it off.

17:04.414 --> 17:06.416
I told you, he's not my type.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.418
You're right.
You only date super handsome,

17:08.462 --> 17:10.333
emotionally
unavailable jerks.

17:10.377 --> 17:14.207
Mmm. Just hearing that
turns me on.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.426
Maybe it's time
for a change.

17:16.470 --> 17:17.775
No one's gonna judge you.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.473
And if they do, who
cares? You're happy.

17:19.516 --> 17:20.778
Yeah. Hey, I had
a type, too,

17:20.822 --> 17:22.519
and it wasn't
a guy in a wheelchair.

17:22.563 --> 17:23.390
Yeah, but Adam's hot.

17:23.433 --> 17:24.434
So hot.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.915
And taken. Taken.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.309
We'll see.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.881
The point is
that cop made you smile

17:36.925 --> 17:39.493
like I haven't seen
in a long time.

17:39.536 --> 17:40.885
You guys are
really underestimating

17:40.929 --> 17:42.713
how shallow I am.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.069
Knockity-knock.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.027
Hey. What are you doing here?

17:52.071 --> 17:55.683
I just came by to bring you
this tiny cactus for luck.

17:57.337 --> 18:02.516
I know it's your first day back
since the... incident.

18:02.559 --> 18:04.692
"Incident." I like that.

18:04.735 --> 18:09.000
Around here, they just call it
"that time I farted on TV."

18:09.044 --> 18:11.351
I hope you're not mad at me
over all of this.

18:11.394 --> 18:14.397
Okay, we got to nip this
in the bud.

18:14.441 --> 18:16.138
Remember when I first
started sponsoring you

18:16.182 --> 18:18.314
and I asked you to do
a fear inventory?

18:18.358 --> 18:20.142
Yeah.Maybe it's time for you to do

18:20.186 --> 18:22.144
another one, because I don't
remember you writing down,

18:22.188 --> 18:24.233
"I'm terrified
that people won't like me."

18:24.277 --> 18:26.366
I didn't write that down.Why not?

18:26.409 --> 18:29.151
I was afraid it would
make you not like me.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.458
Do you see
what you're doing here?

18:31.501 --> 18:33.373
Yeah, yeah.

18:34.548 --> 18:36.419
No.

18:36.463 --> 18:40.249
If you always seek
the validation of other people,

18:40.293 --> 18:41.816
you will never be content,

18:41.859 --> 18:43.992
because you're making them
your higher power.

18:44.035 --> 18:45.559
You're doing
it with me.

18:45.602 --> 18:48.953
And at the end of the day,
I'm just another drunk.

18:48.997 --> 18:52.043
Oh. One who is 60 seconds away
from doing the weather.

18:52.087 --> 18:53.175
Walk with me.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.959
Ooh, we're gonna do the weather?

18:55.003 --> 18:56.613
Mm-hmm.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.704
Nora, I just want to...Watch the cables.

19:02.010 --> 19:06.536
Oh, my God,
that's Sports with Kane Stevens!

19:06.580 --> 19:08.190
And you don't need him
to like you either.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.539
Yes, I do.
No, you don't.

19:09.583 --> 19:12.063
Look, I didn't have
a lot going for me growing up,

19:12.107 --> 19:14.196
but winning people over
was one of my strong suits.

19:14.240 --> 19:18.069
And I'm sure it served you,
but you don't need it anymore.

19:18.113 --> 19:20.246
Let me ask you something.
Do you like yourself?

19:20.289 --> 19:23.031
'Cause that's the only person
you should be concerned about.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.467
Now, off my set.

19:24.511 --> 19:29.646
STAGE MANAGER: All right.
In five, four, three, two...

19:29.690 --> 19:31.213
Look who's back.

19:31.257 --> 19:34.042
All right, before I get
to the five-day,

19:34.085 --> 19:36.871
let me acknowledge something
that got away from me last week.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.873
Laugh it up, Rob.

19:38.916 --> 19:42.485
We all know you're not wearing
pants behind that desk.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.835
Point is, we're
all human.

19:44.879 --> 19:47.795
We have our sunny
days and rainy days.

19:47.838 --> 19:50.232
It's how you dust yourself off

19:50.276 --> 19:53.235
to get to the next day
that matters.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.236
So, looking ahead at...

19:54.280 --> 19:57.283
Oh, my God, she winked at me.

19:57.326 --> 20:00.634
Which is not a big deal...
beginning now.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.757
Andy! I was sleeping,
and the alarm started going off.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.976
I think somebody's breaking in.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.413
You will?

20:40.456 --> 20:43.459
You're the best.
See you soon.

20:54.731 --> 20:56.559
Girl.
