CHRIS ROCK:
In 1985, crime was
on the rise everywhere,

00:07.708 --> 00:10.244
and when I say "everywhere,"
I mean everywhere.

00:10.278 --> 00:12.446
There was white-collar crime.

00:12.480 --> 00:13.681
...swear before this committee
that you will...

00:13.714 --> 00:14.715
There was blue-collar crime.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.251
There was even collard
green crime.

00:17.285 --> 00:21.489
Hey! Come back here
with my pot liquor!

00:21.522 --> 00:24.458
In Bed-Stuy, one crime
was an epidemic--

00:24.492 --> 00:25.459
chain snatching.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.596
Everybody had a gold chain

00:28.629 --> 00:30.398
and somebody was
waiting to snatch it.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.799
Nobody was safe.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.335
Not young people...

00:34.368 --> 00:35.336
Hey!

00:35.369 --> 00:36.437
Not old people...

00:36.470 --> 00:37.438
Oh!

00:37.471 --> 00:39.140
Not even dead people.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.743
I never had a gold chain
because my parents

00:42.776 --> 00:43.911
would never let me get one.

00:43.944 --> 00:46.647
Gold chain?
Is a gold chain
gonna keep the house warm?

00:46.680 --> 00:48.782
Is a gold chain gonna help
you graduate?
Is a gold chain

00:48.816 --> 00:50.818
gonna get rid
of my gout?
Is a gold chain

00:50.851 --> 00:52.220
gonna help clean
this place up?

00:52.253 --> 00:53.854
The only thing you need
with a gold chain

00:53.887 --> 00:56.457
is to lock up the gold gates
on your gold house.
Mmm.

00:56.490 --> 00:59.460
Even though I didn't
have a gold chain,

00:59.493 --> 01:00.694
my father was right.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.330
Vanessa,
look out!

01:03.564 --> 01:04.832
What did I do that for?

01:04.865 --> 01:06.100
Boy, what's
wrong with you?

01:06.134 --> 01:08.102
Sorry, I didn't know.
It was a reflex.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.537
"Sorry" didn't do it.
You did it.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.504
Now, guess what.

01:10.538 --> 01:14.142
You owe Malvo
a gold chain.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.843
Good thing I didn't
stop him from stealing

01:15.876 --> 01:17.711
a gold house.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.180
Tonya!

01:52.213 --> 01:53.647
Tonya!

01:53.681 --> 01:55.516
Come on, we gotta go!

01:55.549 --> 01:57.651
While I was on the hook
for a gold chain,

01:57.685 --> 01:59.720
Tonya was on the line
for the hookup!

01:59.753 --> 02:01.322
What're you doing?

02:01.355 --> 02:02.323
We gotta go to school.

02:02.356 --> 02:05.193
Billy Ocean is coming
to Radio City Music Hall

02:05.226 --> 02:06.527
and the 98th caller
wins tickets.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.162
I faced the same odds
whenever I called

02:08.196 --> 02:09.330
to ask out a girl.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.631
So, what caller are you?

02:10.664 --> 02:12.933
I don't know, I keep
getting a busy signal.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.170
DJ:
Hey! You're caller 98!

02:16.204 --> 02:17.238
That's right, baby,

02:17.271 --> 02:19.307
you are going
to see Billy Ocean.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.475
Well, come on. We're going
to be late-- plus, you know

02:21.509 --> 02:22.710
Mama don't like
you on her phone.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.378
We're giving away
two tickets a day

02:24.412 --> 02:25.813
all this week.
Just be caller 98.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.350
If you want to hear
Billy Ocean sing live nowadays,

02:29.383 --> 02:30.784
you can just call up
Billy Ocean.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.687
Hey there,
Mrs. Rochelle.

02:33.721 --> 02:36.557
Hey, Mr. Omar.

02:36.590 --> 02:39.393
Uh, the mailman left this
letter for Mr. Julius

02:39.427 --> 02:40.494
in my mailbox by mistake.

02:40.528 --> 02:43.397
Oh, okay. Thank you.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.699
By the way, I was
wondering if I could

02:45.733 --> 02:46.700
ask you a favor.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.436
Sure.

02:48.469 --> 02:49.603
You wouldn't
happen to have

02:49.637 --> 02:51.705
another pair of pantyhose
I could borrow?

02:51.739 --> 02:54.208
Pantyhose?

02:54.242 --> 02:55.075
Borrow?

02:55.108 --> 02:57.211
I need a new stocking
cap for my hair.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.011
Oh...

02:58.045 --> 03:01.649
Okay, sure.
You can have these.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.851
Were you about
to put these on,

03:03.884 --> 03:05.653
or did you just
take them off?

03:06.754 --> 03:08.822
They're new, Mr. Omar.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.658
Oh.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.593
Okay, then.

03:12.626 --> 03:13.594
Thanks.

03:13.627 --> 03:14.595
Uh-huh.

03:14.628 --> 03:15.796
I think he's disappointed.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.607
My mother usually wouldn't
open my father's mail...

03:26.640 --> 03:29.610
unless she wanted
to know what was inside.

03:29.643 --> 03:33.614
"Attached is your
new credit card.

03:33.647 --> 03:37.318
Cardholder since 1970"?

03:39.787 --> 03:42.290
Hey, baby.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.324
Any mail?

03:43.357 --> 03:46.294
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.761
Here you go.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.331
My mother told me there's
two things you don't hide

03:50.364 --> 03:53.867
from your wife--
extra women and extra money.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.805
I was so afraid of Malvo
I couldn't think straight.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.777
What are you
still doing here?

04:03.811 --> 04:05.813
Just trying to
figure something out.

04:05.846 --> 04:06.914
You remember Malvo?

04:06.947 --> 04:07.881
Malvo?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.317
I thought he went to jail.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.951
Well, he got out,

04:10.984 --> 04:13.554
and this morning
he tried to snatch a chain.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.788
I saw him coming
up on my friend,

04:14.822 --> 04:15.789
but I didn't know it was him.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.325
Don't tell me you warned her.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.959
I warned her.
Oh, man.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.894
Don't you know if
you see a crime

04:20.928 --> 04:22.963
committed in New York City,
you keep your mouth shut?

04:22.996 --> 04:23.931
I don't care if you
see Ronald Reagan

04:23.964 --> 04:26.900
about to gun down the Pope,
you don't tell!

04:26.934 --> 04:29.069
Greg was a big fan
of editorial cartoons.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.004
It was a reflex.
So you're
sitting here?

04:31.038 --> 04:32.072
Obviously he didn't kill you.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.741
What'd he say?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.576
:
What'd you do that for?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.478
Then what?
Then I said...

04:37.511 --> 04:38.979
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to. It was a reflex.

04:39.012 --> 04:39.847
And then he said,

04:39.880 --> 04:41.982
"'Sorry' didn't do it.
You did."

04:42.015 --> 04:44.818
And then he put a finger
in my chest and said,

04:44.852 --> 04:45.853
"You're gonna get Malvo

04:45.886 --> 04:47.455
a gold chain
by tomorrow night."

04:47.488 --> 04:48.822
And if you don't?

04:48.856 --> 04:51.091
He said, "when you
least expect it,

04:51.124 --> 04:52.560
"I will be there.

04:52.593 --> 04:53.927
"When you're in the shower...

04:56.063 --> 04:58.866
Where's my chain?!

04:58.899 --> 05:00.601
"...when you're watching TV...

05:04.405 --> 05:06.707
Where's my chain?

05:07.875 --> 05:09.943
Even in your dreams."

05:09.977 --> 05:12.880
Chris, I just want
to let you know,

05:12.913 --> 05:16.717
I hate everybody else,
but I love you.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.386
Will you get me a soda?

05:18.419 --> 05:20.087
Yeah.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.958
Where's my chain?

05:24.992 --> 05:26.527
That's so weird.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.996
Guys in my neighborhood
wear gold chains all the time,

05:29.029 --> 05:30.864
You never hear about
one getting snatched.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.500
That's because
it only happened once.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.735
Black-on-black crime is nothing

05:34.768 --> 05:37.037
compared to Italian-
on-Italian crime.

05:37.070 --> 05:40.040
This may sound crazy,
but what if you

05:40.073 --> 05:41.742
just buy one
and give it to him?

05:41.775 --> 05:44.545
I mean, how much do gold
chains cost, anyway?

05:49.583 --> 05:50.551
$300?!

05:50.584 --> 05:51.752
Got any more ideas?

05:51.785 --> 05:55.523
A bus ticket out
of town only cost $35.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.962
CHRIS ROCK:
Since I couldn't afford
to buy a chain,

06:01.995 --> 06:03.997
I avoided Malvo
to buy some time.

06:06.467 --> 06:10.103
* Dooby do, run, run, run

06:10.137 --> 06:13.140
* Dooby do,
run, run, run *

06:15.008 --> 06:17.010
* Dooby do

06:17.044 --> 06:20.080
* Dooby do,
don't spend a dime... *

06:20.113 --> 06:21.915
I took every train.

06:21.949 --> 06:25.953
* Dooby do, run, run, run

06:25.986 --> 06:27.788
* Dooby do...

06:27.821 --> 06:29.457
I took every bus.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.459
* ...like we used to do

06:31.492 --> 06:34.462
* Dooby do, run, run, run

06:34.495 --> 06:36.797
No matter how hard I tried
to avoid Malvo,

06:36.830 --> 06:39.032
he always seemed to be around.

06:39.066 --> 06:42.970
*

06:43.003 --> 06:46.974
If I could've, I would've taken
a underground railroad.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.145
Is you running
to the north?

06:52.179 --> 06:54.081
No, I'm running from Malvo.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.917
Malvo? You'd a been
better off a slave.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.987
Get on, now, and remember--
you ain't seen nothing.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.496
To get the truth about
my father's credit card,

07:08.529 --> 07:11.565
my mother went straight
to the source-- her friends.

07:11.599 --> 07:12.399
Credit card?
Yep.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.034
And you didn't know
anything about it?

07:14.067 --> 07:15.736
Nope.
Mm-hmm.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.105
I know this one woman who caught
her man lying about his height.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.807
His height?
His height?

07:19.840 --> 07:22.109
His height.
Yeah. He had shoe lifts.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.779
Turns out, he had
a whole other family.

07:25.813 --> 07:28.081
That's all my mother
needed to hear.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.506
So are you gonna
ask him about it?

07:52.540 --> 07:54.141
What would she do that for?

07:54.174 --> 07:56.109
Uh-uh.
Don't you ask him nothing.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.778
Just wait. See
what he does.

07:57.811 --> 07:58.979
You've got to be surreptitious

07:59.012 --> 08:01.549
If he is waiting on
that credit card, give him

08:01.582 --> 08:02.616
a couple of days.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.251
He'll start looking for it.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.022
Tonya, get off the phone
and come eat.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.024
Back at home, my mother
wasn't the only one

08:11.058 --> 08:12.259
doing undercover work.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.530
Boy, what you think
this is, a stickup?

08:16.564 --> 08:18.098
Take off that hat
and take off

08:18.131 --> 08:21.769
those glasses and act like
you sitting at the table.

08:21.802 --> 08:22.936
Who were you talking to?

08:22.970 --> 08:24.605
I wasn't talking.
I was trying to see

08:24.638 --> 08:26.674
if I could to win tickets
to see Billy Ocean.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.209
I don't know why you keep
calling-- you're not gonna win.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.043
I hope you win,

08:30.077 --> 08:32.045
'cause I can't
afford to buy them.

08:32.079 --> 08:34.047
No, who knows where
we would get the money from.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.749
I know
that's right.
Too bad we

08:35.783 --> 08:36.917
don't have a credit card...

08:36.950 --> 08:38.051
I am not getting
a credit card

08:38.085 --> 08:39.286
so we can buy
some concert tickets.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.054
So you're saying you don't
want a credit card?

08:41.088 --> 08:42.255
That's right.
Mmm.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.290
I wish I could've told

08:43.323 --> 08:44.892
my father what was going on.

08:44.925 --> 08:45.926
Run, Daddy! Run!

08:45.959 --> 08:47.094
She's being
surreptitious!

08:51.799 --> 08:54.001
Oh, baby, well, I hope
you win those tickets

08:54.034 --> 08:55.703
because we sure are not

08:55.736 --> 08:58.238
gonna buy them
with a credit card.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.774
Pass the syrup.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.810
I was so good
at sneaking around,

09:02.843 --> 09:05.112
I thought about
joining the CIA.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.083
Hey!

09:10.117 --> 09:11.919
Or maybe the D.O.A.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.721
I got a question for
you boy. What is today?

09:13.754 --> 09:16.089
Uh... Wednesday?

09:16.123 --> 09:21.361
Nah. Today is two days after
the day before yesterday.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.696
Malvo was an idiot savant--

09:22.730 --> 09:25.966
98% idiot,
two percent savant.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.068
So the question is,
where's my chain?

09:28.101 --> 09:29.202
I don't have the
money for a chain,

09:29.236 --> 09:30.704
and I don't know
where to get one.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.806
They're generally
found around necks.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.742
Well, maybe I can get
you something else.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.978
Nah. I want a chain.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.713
You know why?
No .

09:39.747 --> 09:43.250
Two reasons. A, since
my most recent parole,

09:43.283 --> 09:45.819
I'm limiting myself
to Class A misdemeanors

09:45.853 --> 09:48.756
and three, nobody
needs a chain.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.123
So I'm actually
doing people a favor

09:50.157 --> 09:52.993
by taking things
that they don't need.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.628
You could argue with his math,

09:54.662 --> 09:55.663
but not with his logic.

09:55.696 --> 09:56.930
All right, I'll get you one.

09:56.964 --> 09:57.998
Oh, I know you will,

09:58.031 --> 09:59.199
or else I'm gonna
have to commit

09:59.232 --> 10:02.269
a Class B misdemeanor on you,
and you don't want that.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.672
He was right, considering
a class B misdemeanor

10:04.705 --> 10:06.173
is cockfighting.

10:06.206 --> 10:10.010
Look, I know you don't want to
do it, but you got no choice.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.278
You're gonna have
to snatch a chain.

10:11.311 --> 10:14.314
You know what my parents'd do
to me if they found out I was

10:14.347 --> 10:15.382
a chain snatcher?
So what about Malvo?

10:15.415 --> 10:17.417
You just going to go back
to him tomorrow and say,

10:17.450 --> 10:19.319
"I don't know where you're
getting your chain from,

10:19.352 --> 10:20.420
but you're not
getting it from me"?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.022
I can't do this.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.024
I don't know anything
about chain snatching.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.225
What's there to know?

10:25.258 --> 10:26.827
The directions are
on the title.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.696
You see a chain,
you snatch it.

10:28.729 --> 10:32.332
I couldn't help but think, if
I did actually snatch a chain,

10:32.365 --> 10:34.802
something would go wrong.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.806
Freeze! FBI!
Show me your hands!

10:38.839 --> 10:40.207
Get on your knees now!

10:40.240 --> 10:43.176
We got you now,
you little chain snatcher.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.245
Frisk him!
Make sure he got

10:45.278 --> 10:47.247
no chains on him.

10:49.282 --> 10:52.052
You want to get away?
Don't try to move.

10:52.085 --> 10:56.189
A jury of your peers has found
you guilty of chain snatching.

10:56.223 --> 10:59.092
I sentence you to death
by electric chair.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.266
Boy, I ought to beat
the legs off of you!

11:06.299 --> 11:08.736
You better take him
to the chair!

11:11.338 --> 11:12.940
Did the governor call, yet?

11:12.973 --> 11:15.175
No, my man, but check this out.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.077
I gotta pick
my brother up at 12:00,

11:17.110 --> 11:18.145
so if you really don't mind,

11:18.178 --> 11:20.748
why don't we just go ahead
and do this, all right?

11:33.794 --> 11:35.162
Better him than me.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.230
(kicking,
stomping,
groaning)

11:37.264 --> 11:39.266
Feels good to be right
for a change.

11:43.971 --> 11:48.241
CHRIS ROCK:
When surreptition didn't work,
my mother tried confrontation.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.242
Hello.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.310
Hey, baby.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.746
You must think I'm stupid.

11:52.780 --> 11:55.849
Oh, yeah. Rochelle is just...

11:55.883 --> 11:56.984
an idiot!

11:57.017 --> 11:59.286
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.321
She don't know what
goes on in this house.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.856
And I damn sure

12:02.890 --> 12:04.391
ain't going
to tell her.

12:04.424 --> 12:07.861
Is that what you tell your
little Puerto Rican mami?

12:07.895 --> 12:10.263
Huh

12:10.297 --> 12:13.000
Did you take them
on vacation and buy

12:13.033 --> 12:15.869
45 cent worth of this?

12:15.903 --> 12:19.372
$1.49 worth of that?

12:19.406 --> 12:21.041
With your credit card?!

12:21.074 --> 12:22.309
A credit card?

12:22.342 --> 12:26.279
Your credit card.

12:26.313 --> 12:29.549
Oh, yeah. Be a man
about it, Julius!

12:29.582 --> 12:32.419
It's got your name on it.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.788
Oh! Oh! And you know what
else it says, Julius?

12:34.822 --> 12:36.123
It says "Cardholder

12:36.156 --> 12:38.191
since 1970"!

12:38.225 --> 12:41.461
That means that
for 15 years,

12:41.494 --> 12:43.296
you've been hiding this from me!

12:43.330 --> 12:45.098
So what do you have

12:45.132 --> 12:47.300
to say for yourself, Julius?

12:47.334 --> 12:49.469
Don't you say another word!

12:49.502 --> 12:51.404
¿Comprende, papi?!

12:51.438 --> 12:52.539
Oh, you been
hiding a credit card.

12:52.572 --> 12:53.540
What else
are you hiding?

12:53.573 --> 12:55.575
Oh. Is Julius really your name?

12:55.608 --> 12:57.544
Oh, maybe you're
the Green River Killer?

12:57.577 --> 12:59.379
Do you know where
Jimmy Hoffa is buried?

12:59.412 --> 13:01.148
Who shot Kennedy?

13:01.181 --> 13:02.482
For all I know,

13:02.515 --> 13:04.284
you could be Batman!

13:04.317 --> 13:06.186
I am not Batman.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.122
I'm Batman.

13:11.191 --> 13:14.594
Julius,
I need to know the truth.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.464
You can't handle the truth!

13:17.497 --> 13:20.333
Rochelle, I couldn't
tell you about it.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.837
Why not?! Do you know how many
times we could have used it?!

13:23.871 --> 13:25.438
That's why I couldn't
tell you about it.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.174
I didn't want
another bill, baby.

13:27.207 --> 13:33.046
Oh. Okay, Mr. Responsibility,
Mr. Fiscally Conservative,

13:33.080 --> 13:34.514
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hide

13:34.547 --> 13:36.249
Things From His Wife,

13:36.283 --> 13:37.517
answer this for me:

13:37.550 --> 13:39.252
since you're
so against credit cards,

13:39.286 --> 13:41.989
why do you have one?

13:42.022 --> 13:44.491
Ask your friends
at the beauty shop.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.899
Why do you keep calling
that station, Tonya?

13:51.932 --> 13:53.366
You're not
going to win.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.068
Why don't you
just quit?
Shut up.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.104
Oh, it's ringing!

13:57.137 --> 13:59.306
Tonya wasn't just waiting
for concert tickets.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.541
She was waiting
for Billy Ocean tickets.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.877
And she would wait
as long as it took.

14:03.911 --> 14:07.514
Dang, girl, you still trying
to get Billy Ocean tickets?

14:07.547 --> 14:10.550
Yeah. He's opening
for Usher at the Beacon.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.085
Hello.

14:12.119 --> 14:14.121
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
Hey. You're caller number 97.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.355
Sorry, baby.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.994
You're caller number 98!

14:21.028 --> 14:22.429
WOMAN:
Oh! Oh! You playing!
You playing!

14:22.462 --> 14:23.530
Told you.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.532
Are you playing me?
I'm going to see Billy Ocean!

14:25.565 --> 14:27.267
Am I really going
to see Billy Ocean?

14:27.300 --> 14:28.535
Come on, man. Don't be playing.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.606
Dad, do you
have a minute?

14:33.640 --> 14:35.943
Sure. What is it?

14:35.976 --> 14:38.278
Well, you know
my friend Greg?

14:38.311 --> 14:40.480
He has a problem.
I want to help him.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.549
What kind of problem?

14:42.582 --> 14:45.953
Well, there's this guy
who wants him to snatch

14:45.986 --> 14:47.087
a chain for him.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.455
Snatch a chain?

14:48.488 --> 14:50.190
That's stealing.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.591
People work hard
for what they have.

14:51.624 --> 14:52.960
Thief, murderer--

14:52.993 --> 14:55.362
it's all the same in my book.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.564
Right. Which is why
he doesn't want to do it.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.200
But, if he doesn't, the guy
is going to beat him up.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.435
But, if he does,
he's going to go to jail.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.503
He's going
to get beat up anyway.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.538
So he can get beat up
for breaki the law,

15:05.572 --> 15:06.706
or beat up
for not breaking the law.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.141
But, at least,
if he doesn't break the law,

15:08.175 --> 15:10.510
the other guy will go to jail,
and he'll get beat up instead.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.712
Huh?

15:12.745 --> 15:15.715
So should he snatch the chain
or not snatch the chain?

15:15.748 --> 15:18.718
Not snatch the chain.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.520
Why didn't you just say that?

15:20.553 --> 15:21.688
Oh. Thanks.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.590
I'll tell Greg
what you said.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.492
Why didn't Greg
ask his own father for help?

15:25.525 --> 15:27.527
'Cause he didn't know
what he was going to do.

15:27.560 --> 15:31.331
Well, tell him
don't do nothing stupid.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.000
Okay.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.506
Drew didn't know
what it felt like to lose,

15:39.539 --> 15:42.009
but he hated the way
it looked on Tonya.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.576
Give me the phone.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.155
ANNOUNCER:
Hey. What's your name?

15:55.188 --> 15:56.389
Tonya.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.458
Tonya. Hey, I'm sorry
to tell you this, baby,

15:58.491 --> 16:00.593
but you're caller number 98!

16:00.627 --> 16:02.529
You're going to see Billy Ocean!

16:02.562 --> 16:03.763
Drew was so lucky,

16:03.796 --> 16:06.499
one time a horse tried to take
his shoe for good luck.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.269
Meanwhile, when my mother
was upset with my father,

16:09.302 --> 16:12.372
she would do everything mad,
like mad-folding...

16:12.405 --> 16:14.241
Lying to me 15 years!

16:14.274 --> 16:16.176
Hiding a credit card!

16:16.209 --> 16:18.145
And mad-cooking...

16:18.178 --> 16:20.513
Got some woman spending money
I'm supposed to be spending!

16:26.553 --> 16:28.621
And mad-sleeping...

16:28.655 --> 16:30.690
Buying somebody else
real leather...

16:33.726 --> 16:36.396
Letting the storm subside
wasn't working,

16:36.429 --> 16:40.567
so my father had to walk
into the eye of the hurricane.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.669
Rochelle, I don't
want you be mad at me.

16:42.702 --> 16:46.606
Hah! Should have thought
about that 15 years ago.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.308
Why am I always
the last to know?

16:48.341 --> 16:51.444
Here I am, worried about where
you are, what you're doing,

16:51.478 --> 16:53.613
and who you're
doing it with.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.148
You're supposed to be my man.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.617
You turn out
being The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.652
I can explain.

16:59.686 --> 17:03.623
Look, 15 years ago, I was
flat broke and needed money.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.625
That's no different
than 15 seconds ago.

17:05.658 --> 17:06.726
Mm-hmm.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.695
The department store
was giving these things away.

17:08.728 --> 17:12.332
Hah! Really? Did they give you
tips on where to hide it?

17:12.365 --> 17:14.834
I bought one thing, and it took
seven years to pay off.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.336
What about the other
eight years, Julius?

17:16.369 --> 17:17.437
Every time I tried
to cancel the card,

17:17.470 --> 17:19.639
they just sent me a new one
and raised the limit.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.475
Okay, Mr. A+ on your FICA score,

17:22.509 --> 17:24.711
what did you buy
that was so important

17:24.744 --> 17:27.514
that I had to wait 15 years
to find out about?!

17:30.217 --> 17:32.185
Your wedding ring.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.753
For the first time in 15 years,

17:33.786 --> 17:35.655
my father got my mother
to shut up.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.457
I'm sorry.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.259
I should have told you.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.194
Here's what
he really wanted to say:

17:41.228 --> 17:42.829
Hah! In your face!

17:42.862 --> 17:45.665
You wrong, you wrong,
you wrong and I am right!

17:45.698 --> 17:47.367
Uh!

17:47.400 --> 17:49.402
Uh! Uh! Uh! Ah!

17:49.436 --> 17:52.472
I'm right, I'm right,
I'm right, I'm right,

17:52.505 --> 17:54.741
I'm right,
I'm right,
I'm right!

17:54.774 --> 17:56.109
And, out on the street,

17:56.143 --> 17:58.378
I had finally
gotten my nerve up.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.316
You got my chain?

18:03.350 --> 18:04.484
No.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.619
I'm not getting you one either.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.489
Boy, you think
I'm playing with you!

18:09.522 --> 18:10.790
Let him go.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.459
Who you supposed
to be?

18:12.492 --> 18:14.494
Dad, it's okay.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.264
Dad?

18:17.297 --> 18:18.798
He wasn't surprised
that was my father.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.767
That was just the first
father he had ever seen.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.203
So I'm supposed to be afraid
'cause you brought

18:23.236 --> 18:24.371
your daddy out here?

18:24.404 --> 18:25.805
No, you're supposed
to be scared because,

18:25.838 --> 18:27.674
if you ever put your hands
on my son again,

18:27.707 --> 18:28.808
you ain't going to jail.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.510
I'm going to jail.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.644
What you going to do?

18:31.678 --> 18:33.780
You'll find out what
I'm going to do.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.315
You think I'm playing?

18:35.348 --> 18:37.717
When you're in the shower,
I'm going to be there.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.189
You think I'm playing?

18:42.222 --> 18:45.124
When you're watching TV,
I'm going to be there.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.662
Think I'm playing?

18:51.231 --> 18:54.301
Even in your dreams,
I'm going to be there.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.636
Mr. Malvo, you're free to go.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.505
Case dismissed.

18:58.538 --> 19:01.374
What I tell you, dude? Hey!

19:01.408 --> 19:02.742
You think I'm playing?

19:02.775 --> 19:05.778
Yeah. That's all right.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.614
It's going
to be all right!

19:07.647 --> 19:08.748
You lucky
I don't know my daddy.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.684
That was the slogan
for the Bed-Stuy Boys' Club.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.754
Dad, how did you know I was
talking about me and not Greg?

19:14.787 --> 19:19.726
Chris, white kids
don't snatch chains.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.395
Lucky for me, snatching chains
was fading out.

19:22.429 --> 19:25.432
Unfortunately, it was
replaced by a new crime...

19:25.465 --> 19:26.799
carjacking.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.905
Vanessa, look out!

19:36.776 --> 19:39.779
Man, you owe me a car!

19:40.613 --> 19:43.383
* Everybody hates Chris. *

19:43.416 --> 19:47.420
