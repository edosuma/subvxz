00:01.120 --> 00:03.580
Previously on "Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

00:03.580 --> 00:05.000
I present to you
Project Insight.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.040
We move fast,
we stop that satellite.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.420
If we can position
the charges right,

00:08.420 --> 00:10.040
we can fill the base
with lake water.

00:10.040 --> 00:11.040
Which would set off
evac protocol

00:11.040 --> 00:12.000
and shut down
the launch.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.960
Nathaniel: So happy
you came back into my life.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.420
Simmons: Something's wrong.

00:17.420 --> 00:19.290
I feel like
I've been...slipping.

00:19.290 --> 00:20.830
You are forgetting?

00:20.830 --> 00:22.710
We want S.H.I.E.L.D.
to reveal themselves.

00:22.710 --> 00:24.710
S.H.I.E.L.D. will find you here.
And when they do,

00:24.710 --> 00:26.290
you will have leverage.

00:26.290 --> 00:29.040
My parents.
They'll drown.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.170
-Abort.
-We can't let it launch.

00:32.620 --> 00:33.960
Insight
has been destroyed.

00:33.960 --> 00:35.330
But we just gave up
our position.

00:56.330 --> 00:59.580
Sibyl:
All life follows these patterns.

00:59.580 --> 01:03.880
Eroded coastlines,
seashells,

01:03.880 --> 01:05.290
leaves.

01:08.210 --> 01:10.620
A new world blooms
beneath your feet.

01:12.460 --> 01:14.120
Can you feel it?

01:16.380 --> 01:19.120
I feel the weight
of Malick's death.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.540
Of Insight
being destroyed.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.710
Is that the world
you envisioned?

01:23.710 --> 01:27.120
As one branch dies,
a new one bears fruit.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.540
Do not speak in metaphor,
Sibyl.

01:29.540 --> 01:31.250
Your path has led
to disaster.

01:31.250 --> 01:33.080
Has it?

01:33.080 --> 01:35.710
S.H.I.E.L.D. revealed
their ship to destroy Insight.

01:35.710 --> 01:37.670
We have their location.

01:37.670 --> 01:40.380
Malick's son
captured Daisy Johnson.

01:40.380 --> 01:42.290
They are divided.

01:42.290 --> 01:44.420
And Alphonso Mackenzie's
parents

01:44.420 --> 01:46.040
will force them
into the Lighthouse.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.460
They are reckless.

01:47.460 --> 01:50.420
They have begun to
bend under stress.

01:50.420 --> 01:52.120
You wish
to overwhelm them.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.080
I do.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.040
Begin the next phase.

01:55.040 --> 01:58.380
I will wake the Hunters
one by one.

01:58.380 --> 02:00.960
We must continue
to adapt.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.210
We have zero booster reading.

02:27.210 --> 02:28.750
Radar is picking up
a debris field.

02:28.750 --> 02:30.250
Copy.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.880
Confirm air-to-air
missile strike.

02:33.380 --> 02:34.880
Insight is down.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.290
We know
the rocket is dead.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.290
Find me the ship
that killed it.

02:38.290 --> 02:40.540
Guard: Sir.

02:40.540 --> 02:42.790
Stoner: So, sucker punching me
wasn't enough.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.790
You're saboteurs.

02:46.790 --> 02:48.670
Your friends blew up
my rocket.

02:48.670 --> 02:50.170
On the Fourth of July.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.080
You didn't want that thing
to reach orbit, General.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.170
You would have found that out
the hard way.

02:53.170 --> 02:55.250
Because
time-traveling robots

02:55.250 --> 02:58.080
would have turned their
deadly lasers upon the earth?

02:58.080 --> 02:59.210
More or less.
Yeah.

02:59.210 --> 03:00.500
And you.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.330
This was destined

03:02.330 --> 03:04.620
for a celebratory barbecue,
Chastity.

03:06.790 --> 03:08.460
That's not your real name,
is it?

03:08.460 --> 03:11.250
Melinda May.
I'm not an HR Liaison.

03:11.250 --> 03:13.830
I think he got that from
the bag of explosives.

03:13.830 --> 03:14.960
Ford: Sir.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.670
We have the hostile bogey.

03:16.670 --> 03:17.880
All right,
now we're talking.

03:17.880 --> 03:19.670
It's a faint signal.
We're working on it.

03:19.670 --> 03:21.460
They shouldn't be able
to track Z1.

03:21.460 --> 03:24.080
Advanced Integrated
Tracking System.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.790
Little gift from our friend,
Mr. Malick.

03:27.790 --> 03:30.250
They'll be blown
out of the sky.

03:30.250 --> 03:31.460
Simmons:
They had to see us.

03:31.460 --> 03:34.750
We launched a missile
in broad daylight.

03:34.750 --> 03:38.880
All signals are quiet,
even with the Quinjet docking.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.670
Well, keep scanning,
and re-engage cloaking.

03:43.670 --> 03:46.120
Glad to see you.
Where's Malick?

03:46.120 --> 03:48.790
It's complicated. We went there.
He was waiting for us --

03:48.790 --> 03:51.000
He's dead.
I shot him.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.380
That wasn't the order,
Agent Shaw.

03:52.380 --> 03:53.920
Deke: Yeah, but he kept
making waves.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.330
I thought
it was best to --

03:55.330 --> 03:56.750
Damn it,
that wasn't the order!

03:56.750 --> 03:59.040
I don't have time to deal
with you right now.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.540
We need to get moving.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.580
You got a 20
on Daisy and Sousa?

04:02.580 --> 04:04.580
I checked every camera feed
in the Lighthouse.

04:04.580 --> 04:05.750
No sign of them.

04:05.750 --> 04:07.500
I can't be out
my strongest fighter.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.170
Deke, stay put.

04:09.170 --> 04:10.880
I want every scanner on
this ship searching --

04:10.880 --> 04:13.210
But I know the Lighthouse.
Your parents could be --

04:13.210 --> 04:14.580
Running out of time.

04:14.580 --> 04:15.920
There's no debate
on this.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.120
I blew up
the one reason

04:17.120 --> 04:19.290
those Chronicoms had
to keep them alive.

04:19.290 --> 04:20.580
I need
to get in there now.

04:20.580 --> 04:22.420
There's another reason --
It's a trap.

04:22.420 --> 04:23.420
I don't have a choice.

04:23.420 --> 04:24.460
Which is why
I'm coming with you.

04:24.460 --> 04:25.880
And there's no debate
on that.

04:27.330 --> 04:29.000
I'll start pre-flight.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.080
Simmons, scan for
Daisy and Sousa,

04:34.080 --> 04:35.540
and while you're at it,
scan for the enemy ship.

04:35.540 --> 04:36.880
We gave up our position.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.170
That may cause them
to give up theirs.

04:38.170 --> 04:39.620
Yes, Director.

04:39.620 --> 04:41.580
Let's bring the pain
to them for once.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.420
The launch silo's
our only chance of getting in

04:48.420 --> 04:50.710
before they lock down
the base.

04:50.710 --> 04:52.080
It's bad enough
we don't have a plan,

04:52.080 --> 04:54.000
now there's probably
no way out.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.040
We're good under pressure.

04:57.040 --> 05:00.420
Today's
the Bicentennial.

05:00.420 --> 05:02.540
My parents threw a picnic
at the lake.

05:02.540 --> 05:05.380
Whole family.

05:05.380 --> 05:09.670
Rocket pops and raising hell
with my cousins.

05:14.670 --> 05:16.500
It's not supposed
to be like this.

05:16.500 --> 05:19.080
The Chronicoms are trying to
get into your head, Mack.

05:20.880 --> 05:26.750
This isn't exactly how I'd
imagined you'd meet my parents.

05:26.750 --> 05:29.250
But what a first
impression, huh?

05:32.540 --> 05:34.170
Welcome to the Lighthouse.

05:34.170 --> 05:36.790
We have enacted
Lockdown Protocol.

05:36.790 --> 05:38.620
All movement is prohibited.

05:38.620 --> 05:39.960
Who initiated Lockdown?

05:39.960 --> 05:41.540
It wasn't my order.

05:41.540 --> 05:43.000
Welcome to the Lighthouse.
And today of all days,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
all orders come from me.
We have enacted
Lockdown Protocol.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.330
They're using the lockdown
to divide and conquer the base.

05:47.330 --> 05:48.920
I didn't bring you
here to speak.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.210
Lighthouse
anti-aircraft batteries

05:50.210 --> 05:51.670
have locked onto
the bogey, sir.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.210
I haven't
ordered that yet.

05:55.210 --> 05:56.920
The missiles have begun
their arming sequence.

05:58.380 --> 06:00.460
The system is running
on its own.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.540
Anything computerized
has been hijacked.

06:02.540 --> 06:04.880
Agent, do not fire on
that ship until I tell you to!

06:04.880 --> 06:07.330
Go downstairs and rip out
the mainframe if you have to.

06:07.330 --> 06:08.790
You're too late.

06:08.790 --> 06:10.250
Sir...

06:10.250 --> 06:12.960
missiles are away.

06:14.420 --> 06:15.540
Incoming!

06:16.960 --> 06:18.000
Three missiles inbound!

06:18.000 --> 06:20.170
Prepare yourselves
for extreme G's!

06:40.830 --> 06:42.460
Good to see you move.

06:42.460 --> 06:44.580
My head.

06:44.580 --> 06:46.500
Ohh, I can barely...

06:46.500 --> 06:49.670
Feels like there's cement
running through my veins.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.580
Drugs.

06:51.580 --> 06:53.750
Haven't been this messed up
since the field hospital.

06:56.210 --> 06:58.250
I want to hea--
hear that story

06:58.250 --> 07:00.920
when I...
I can remember it.

07:07.170 --> 07:10.710
I can't quake.

07:14.420 --> 07:16.790
Malick's
little psycho...

07:16.790 --> 07:18.420
Man: Psycho?

07:18.420 --> 07:21.170
That's unfair --
and very well-timed.

07:21.170 --> 07:23.620
Wow.
Right as I'm walking in.

07:23.620 --> 07:25.170
Hi. Nathaniel.

07:25.170 --> 07:26.580
Uh, the two of you
took me hostage --

07:26.580 --> 07:27.920
changed my life.

07:27.920 --> 07:30.080
Yeah.
How about you unchain us,

07:30.080 --> 07:32.080
and we can hug it out?

07:32.080 --> 07:36.540
And Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D.
can be together at last.

07:36.540 --> 07:37.880
Hydra?

07:37.880 --> 07:40.080
I-I look like Hydra
to you?

07:40.080 --> 07:42.210
Take a look
at Ron's suit.

07:42.210 --> 07:44.330
Guy's here 'cause
he's got mouths to feed,

07:44.330 --> 07:46.380
not 'cause he worships
a space octopus.

07:46.380 --> 07:48.790
No. Religion's not really
my thing.

07:48.790 --> 07:50.540
I don't want to know
what your thing is, kid.

07:50.540 --> 07:54.000
But it's you,
Daniel.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.330
You're my thing.

07:56.330 --> 07:58.000
Whoa.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.120
Come on.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.880
Danny.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.380
You know.
I know.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.460
Daisy here can move things
without touching them.

08:05.460 --> 08:06.620
And you?

08:06.620 --> 08:07.960
You either fought
the Krauts in diapers

08:07.960 --> 08:09.880
or you're aging
much slower

08:09.880 --> 08:11.960
than the other
60-somethings I know.

08:11.960 --> 08:13.710
Yeah, he's not what you think.
He's not --

08:13.710 --> 08:15.750
You mean he's not
an Inhuman?

08:15.750 --> 08:18.210
He'd better hope he is.

08:20.080 --> 08:23.500
See, uh, the family business --

08:23.500 --> 08:27.830
I dabbled, but, um,
nothing really spoke to me.

08:27.830 --> 08:31.170
Until I met you.

08:32.830 --> 08:34.710
Saw what you could do.

08:34.710 --> 08:36.960
Whoa.

08:36.960 --> 08:39.080
You haven't even seen
the half of it.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.210
I really hope not.

08:42.210 --> 08:44.960
And a cool thing to say,
by the way.

08:44.960 --> 08:48.000
Your whole vibe
is just...great.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.380
That's why you took us hostage,
to find out --

08:51.380 --> 08:52.920
"Hostage" would imply

08:52.920 --> 08:55.620
that I'm using you as collateral
to get what I want

08:55.620 --> 08:58.420
when, in fact, everything
I want is right here,

08:58.420 --> 09:01.500
flowing through
your veins.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.120
This isn't the super serum.
This is genetics.

09:04.120 --> 09:07.960
Yeah, but I'm rich.
It, uh, cuts down some barriers.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.620
Plus, Hydra families
keep in touch.

09:09.620 --> 09:12.000
I mean, Dr. Reinhardt
has some very helpful tips.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.380
What's he always
saying?

09:13.380 --> 09:16.460
"Discovery requires
experimentation."

09:16.460 --> 09:19.210
Dr. Reinhardt? Didn't we
catch him in the war?

09:19.210 --> 09:22.000
Yes, and thank you
for your service.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.830
My generation just
does not say it enough.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.790
You mean
Daniel Whitehall.

09:28.380 --> 09:29.500
I will crush you...

09:29.500 --> 09:31.500
Yes.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.920
Do it.

09:32.920 --> 09:36.040
Just one bone shaker,
and it's over.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.580
Show me what makes you
so special.

09:48.830 --> 09:50.080
We start with her.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.420
No.

09:52.420 --> 09:56.250
This base just shot down
a plane full of good agents.

09:56.250 --> 09:58.620
They blew up the country's
most important defense system.

09:58.620 --> 09:59.710
Of course
we fired on them.

09:59.710 --> 10:01.580
You didn't fire.

10:01.580 --> 10:03.420
Someone took over
the Lighthouse, as we warned.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.420
Imagine I believe you,
and we've been infiltrated.

10:09.420 --> 10:11.580
What am I looking for?

10:11.580 --> 10:14.710
They're partially
synthetic humanoids.

10:14.710 --> 10:17.420
They don't quite act like us,
but to blend in,

10:17.420 --> 10:19.380
they do steal
and wear our faces.

10:19.380 --> 10:20.920
They take our faces?

10:20.920 --> 10:22.880
He's telling the truth.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.290
They're called
Chronicoms.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.380
And your name is
Chastity McBride.

10:31.500 --> 10:35.460
Insight was my first post
out of the Academy.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.880
Hell of a mess
you made.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.540
Enjoy your time
in prison.

10:39.540 --> 10:41.170
Stoner: Easy, Kojak.

10:41.170 --> 10:43.540
Try to hold ourselves
to a professional demeanor.

10:43.540 --> 10:46.120
Sorry, sir.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.620
Ford requested you down in
the basement in person, sir.

10:48.620 --> 10:50.040
They've got something.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.750
See?

10:51.750 --> 10:53.620
We're handling this.

10:53.620 --> 10:54.830
Let us help.

10:54.830 --> 10:57.830
Did you pay Fred Malick
a visit?

10:57.830 --> 10:59.580
Yes.
He's Hydra.

10:59.580 --> 11:05.460
Not anymore. He's dead,
so...you just stay here.

11:11.670 --> 11:14.670
There's something wrong
with that Agent.

11:14.670 --> 11:16.170
I know.

11:16.170 --> 11:17.540
You'd think
someone named Stoner

11:17.540 --> 11:19.330
would be
a little more fun --
No.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.710
The woman.

11:21.710 --> 11:24.170
I felt nothing.

11:24.170 --> 11:25.830
Like you.

11:25.830 --> 11:27.620
She's a Chronicom.

11:35.250 --> 11:37.460
All the cloaking in the world
won't help if we're smoking.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.540
The fire's out, okay?
It's out.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.880
We have
a more pressing issue.

11:46.420 --> 11:47.750
No.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.330
What is that?

11:49.330 --> 11:51.830
What was that?!
And -- just guessing --

11:51.830 --> 11:52.750
how's it gonna kill us?

11:54.380 --> 11:57.500
When the Drive jumps,
it takes the Zephyr with it

11:57.500 --> 11:59.790
due to a network of cables
that encompass the ship.

11:59.790 --> 12:01.290
It carries the current
from the drive

12:01.290 --> 12:02.620
to the shielding
around the Zephyr.

12:02.620 --> 12:04.120
Without
the shielding intact,

12:04.120 --> 12:06.000
only parts of the ship
would jump away,

12:06.000 --> 12:07.790
and what remains
would be pulverized

12:07.790 --> 12:10.210
like a Xandarian snail
in a liquifactor.

12:10.210 --> 12:11.920
Why do you sound so calm
about that?!

12:11.920 --> 12:13.250
And we could jump
at any moment,

12:13.250 --> 12:14.540
so we need to fix this
immediately.

12:14.540 --> 12:16.500
Okay,
so what do we do now?

12:18.290 --> 12:19.830
The power regulator --
take a look at it.

12:19.830 --> 12:21.380
You start there,

12:21.380 --> 12:23.620
and Enoch and I will rewire
the control panel.

12:23.620 --> 12:24.880
Consider it done.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.580
Are you okay?

12:31.580 --> 12:33.460
Shouldn't I know
how to fix this?

12:35.710 --> 12:37.880
Why can't I remember
how to fix it?

12:37.880 --> 12:40.670
Don't worry,
Jemma Simmons.

12:40.670 --> 12:41.920
It will be all right.

12:41.920 --> 12:45.380
But we must act now.

12:47.040 --> 12:47.880
It's gonna be okay.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.330
Aah!

12:52.080 --> 12:54.170
Oh, God, what now?

13:01.080 --> 13:03.500
It's okay.
It's okay.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.710
We're here
to get you out.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.540
-Hey!
-Hey, hey.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.290
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Hey, what are you doing, man?

13:12.290 --> 13:15.120
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, sir, ma'am.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.920
I just got carried away.

13:16.920 --> 13:19.120
Who are you?

13:19.120 --> 13:22.040
Um, this is
Agent Rodriguez.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.250
Uh, she's
my girlfriend.

13:24.250 --> 13:27.500
Oh, I don't think these
strangers care about that,

13:27.500 --> 13:29.420
Director Mack...lemore.

13:29.420 --> 13:33.080
Um, you can call me Elena,
and please excuse my partner.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.170
He's just happy that
you guys are safe.

13:35.170 --> 13:39.080
I'm John.
She's Lilla.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.920
Uh, sorry. This whole day
has been a nightmare.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.620
I'm sure it has.

13:43.620 --> 13:46.460
But if you do what we say
and we keep moving,

13:46.460 --> 13:48.750
we will get you home.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.830
We were food shopping
for a party.

14:00.830 --> 14:04.080
Men just came right up to us in
the parking lot and took us.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.330
Why?

14:05.330 --> 14:07.170
Collateral.

14:07.170 --> 14:08.830
But I don't get it.
We're nobody.

14:08.830 --> 14:11.460
You're not nobody.

14:11.460 --> 14:15.120
I just wish I had
a better explanation.

14:20.420 --> 14:22.210
If everything
goes right,

14:22.210 --> 14:24.620
we can bypass
the people that took you.

14:24.620 --> 14:26.460
They're cowards.

14:26.460 --> 14:29.330
Whatever they wanted,
our plane is nearby.

14:29.330 --> 14:30.920
You'll be safe soon.

14:33.460 --> 14:36.080
What exactly happens
if we can't avoid them, sir?

14:39.620 --> 14:41.790
Then you find cover.

14:43.290 --> 14:45.620
And you -- you don't
have to call me "sir."

14:45.620 --> 14:47.920
It's -- It's just "Mack."

14:57.040 --> 14:59.250
We've unlocked an elevator
to the basement.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.120
Something is definitely
screwing with the mainframe.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.540
Just rip it out?

15:02.540 --> 15:04.080
We need
your authority override

15:04.080 --> 15:05.670
to reboot the systems, sir.
Welcome to the Lighthouse.

15:05.670 --> 15:07.500
Computers.
We have enacted
Lockdown Protocol.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.960
My own face is aiding
the damn enemy today.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.500
Turn it off.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.830
We'll remove your face
ASAP, sir.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.750
Don't get wise,
Agent King.

15:15.750 --> 15:18.170
May: I'm telling you,
she is a Chronicom.

15:18.170 --> 15:20.460
She had the same void of
emotions that I get from you.

15:20.460 --> 15:23.540
But she showed emotion.
She had a personality.

15:23.540 --> 15:25.080
She was the person
Stoner knew.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.580
Chronicoms
can't mimic that.

15:26.580 --> 15:27.790
You can.

15:27.790 --> 15:29.540
I'm not like them.

15:29.540 --> 15:31.790
I may not be what I used to be,
but I'm not one of them.

15:31.790 --> 15:33.670
But she was.

15:33.670 --> 15:36.290
So we need to warn them --
And I don't appreciate
this attitude from you.

15:36.290 --> 15:38.000
I don't have attitude.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.330
That's my point.

15:39.330 --> 15:41.000
Not having attitude
is my attitude?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.420
Yes.

15:42.420 --> 15:43.750
I don't know
what's going on inside you,

15:43.750 --> 15:45.040
but you're smart.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.750
You're smart enough to know
that this --

15:46.750 --> 15:48.830
it's not simple for me,

15:48.830 --> 15:51.920
and -- and I would
turn to you for...

15:51.920 --> 15:53.290
For what?
I don't know. For --

15:53.290 --> 15:56.420
For validation?
Maybe, Melinda.
Something.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.880
I died, and I came back.
Yeah.

15:58.880 --> 16:00.380
I didn't ask for that.

16:00.380 --> 16:01.540
But here we are.

16:01.540 --> 16:03.080
And, okay,
you don't feel.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.790
But you won't even
tell me what you think.

16:04.790 --> 16:05.830
You want to know
what I think?

16:05.830 --> 16:06.920
Yeah.

16:06.920 --> 16:08.960
You never die.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.460
You always come back.

16:10.460 --> 16:12.580
You know how many times
I've mourned you?

16:12.580 --> 16:14.790
I'm not doing it again.

16:14.790 --> 16:16.380
And I'm certainly
not doing it for a decoy

16:16.380 --> 16:18.210
with a simulated
personality!

16:18.210 --> 16:20.880
Thank you!
There she is!

16:20.880 --> 16:22.960
Don't look now, but your
emotions are coming back.

16:24.380 --> 16:27.080
Unless you just picked that up
from watching me.

16:29.460 --> 16:32.380
They're mimicking me.
Adapting.

16:32.380 --> 16:33.960
Are we done
sharing now?

16:35.540 --> 16:37.670
On the train.

16:37.670 --> 16:39.000
He said they adapt.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
They saw me and realized
they could steal personalities.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.380
What if
they're doing that?

16:43.380 --> 16:45.750
What if they have a method
of taking our memories,

16:45.750 --> 16:49.250
our identities, and uploading
them into Chronicom bodies?

16:49.250 --> 16:51.620
Replace the Agents,
use them to take over.

16:51.620 --> 16:53.290
Yeah.

16:53.290 --> 16:54.710
And General Stoner's next.

16:59.880 --> 17:02.080
What the hell?

17:02.080 --> 17:03.580
No.

17:03.580 --> 17:05.580
Nooooo!

17:12.500 --> 17:15.880
Ford.
What is so important?

17:15.880 --> 17:17.920
Sorry, sir. We needed
your override authority

17:17.920 --> 17:19.120
to take back
mainframe control.

17:19.120 --> 17:20.750
Whatever gets us
up and running.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.080
All right, come on.
This way.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.460
Lilla:
Another dead end?

17:38.460 --> 17:40.620
We should go
another way.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.460
Our jet's on the other side
of that door.

17:43.460 --> 17:44.710
We're exactly
where we need to be.

17:44.710 --> 17:47.540
This is not where
I'm supposed to be today!

17:47.540 --> 17:49.670
I picked the safest route
possible. Trust me.

17:49.670 --> 17:52.460
I'll trust you
when my back's

17:52.460 --> 17:54.710
not up against
a three-ton steel wall.

17:59.250 --> 18:01.290
I'm trying.

18:01.290 --> 18:02.790
But he's trying me.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.540
He doesn't know you.

18:04.540 --> 18:05.830
It's not about you.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.830
We've got two boys
at home.

18:12.420 --> 18:16.460
Well, I can't solve
that problem just yet.

18:16.460 --> 18:19.330
But I do know if I can't
fix one thing...

18:19.330 --> 18:21.960
You fix another.

18:21.960 --> 18:23.580
Yeah.

18:25.670 --> 18:31.170
The thing is, the, uh --
the locks on this blast door

18:31.170 --> 18:36.080
are a lot like
the brake calipers on a car.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.500
They clamp onto the door?

18:38.500 --> 18:40.830
We bust the locks,
the door slides open.

18:40.830 --> 18:43.080
And we go home.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.790
Think you can
help me with that?

18:44.790 --> 18:48.750
Brute force won't work
against the rotors, but...

18:48.750 --> 18:52.080
think we could find
the hydraulics line and cut it?

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Yeah.
Yeah, that'd work.

19:02.170 --> 19:04.330
Bring in another Hunter
for the next conversion.

19:06.210 --> 19:07.790
Never keep your back
to a door.

19:29.290 --> 19:31.040
I believe you!

19:33.120 --> 19:34.830
Coulson: I'm sorry you had
to learn about it

19:34.830 --> 19:36.290
this way, General.

19:38.620 --> 19:40.330
Stoner:
Agent Ford attacked me.

19:40.330 --> 19:43.040
This is a Chronicom
replacement room.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.120
The table
copies your mind to him.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.830
Then they take
your face.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.380
Those were friends.

19:51.380 --> 19:54.670
It's...them?
They're dead?

19:54.670 --> 19:56.380
I'm sorry.

19:56.380 --> 19:57.500
This device
is out of commission.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.830
They won't take
anyone else.

19:58.830 --> 20:01.290
They've still got my agents
trapped down in this base.

20:01.290 --> 20:03.880
We need to get people out,
regroup topside.

20:07.170 --> 20:09.000
What about Mack?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.500
You know he came in
for his parents.

20:10.500 --> 20:14.420
He'll be finding
his way out with them.

20:14.420 --> 20:16.960
That's good.
Link up with him.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.330
What are you doing?

20:18.330 --> 20:20.500
This is the very bottom
of the Lighthouse, right?

20:20.500 --> 20:22.790
They mentioned bringing
more Chronicoms up.

20:24.380 --> 20:26.830
I'm gonna see
where they're coming from.

20:28.670 --> 20:31.790
Nathaniel:
Okay. Any more, and I'll
kill the golden goose.

20:31.790 --> 20:33.620
Let her recover.

20:34.790 --> 20:35.920
Be careful!

20:35.920 --> 20:38.120
You're not bouncing
some drunk from the bar.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.000
What did you do?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.500
Took as much blood
and spinal fluid

20:52.500 --> 20:53.500
as I thought
she could handle.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.120
A couple glands.

20:55.120 --> 20:58.170
Now I got to synthesize it all
and transfuse it to me.

20:58.170 --> 21:01.670
Now, I know, it's risky,
but, uh...

21:01.670 --> 21:03.420
I want to try
new things.

21:03.420 --> 21:05.670
If it doesn't work, we'll
switch from needles to knives.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.540
Daisy?

21:09.540 --> 21:11.920
Jiaying.
It happened...

21:11.920 --> 21:13.380
It happened before.

21:13.380 --> 21:15.540
Hey, stay with me.

21:15.540 --> 21:16.500
What do you mean
this happened before?

21:16.500 --> 21:17.920
Jiaying.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.750
I ca--

21:20.750 --> 21:21.750
Jiaying.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.040
Hey, hey, hey.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.880
You wanted to hear
my story, right?

21:24.880 --> 21:26.790
Right, well,

21:26.790 --> 21:31.250
I think it was,
uh, foggy.

21:31.250 --> 21:32.750
I can't really
remember the hit,

21:32.750 --> 21:34.250
but I came to,

21:34.250 --> 21:38.170
and my leg
was a pulpy mess...

21:38.170 --> 21:41.540
and I was
completely alone.

21:41.540 --> 21:43.710
Okay.

21:46.670 --> 21:49.540
And then Mike Stephens
showed up.

21:49.540 --> 21:53.880
And the thing about Mike
is he was a resolute ass.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.580
He would never shut up.

21:55.580 --> 22:00.080
He was always bullying
the new guys, stole cigs.

22:00.080 --> 22:05.000
But that day,
he just kept talking to me...

22:06.750 --> 22:09.000
...carried me back
from the line.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.710
Hey. Hey.
Wake up. Okay?

22:11.710 --> 22:13.790
Stay awake, okay?

22:15.880 --> 22:19.750
For the next couple hours,
he stayed with me.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.380
When the Germans
advanced,

22:21.380 --> 22:23.880
when the cold got so bad
I thought we would freeze,

22:23.880 --> 22:27.460
he just kept telling me,
"We are going home."

22:32.960 --> 22:34.710
And then at some point,
I was in a field stretcher,

22:34.710 --> 22:36.670
and, uh...

22:36.670 --> 22:38.290
Mike wasn't.

22:41.040 --> 22:43.500
So...consider my yapping

22:43.500 --> 22:45.880
as a way of passing on
the favor.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.920
We are going home,
Agent Johnson.

22:47.920 --> 22:50.880
You hear me?
We're going home.

22:50.880 --> 22:51.960
But you have got
to fight.

23:07.330 --> 23:09.290
Plenty of fight left in ya
after all.

23:47.460 --> 23:48.670
What the hell?

23:54.830 --> 23:56.880
Nana, wake up.
Something happened.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.000
Enoch's a traitor.

23:58.000 --> 23:58.880
Are you okay?

23:58.880 --> 24:00.290
Deke?

24:03.830 --> 24:05.670
Deke...

24:05.670 --> 24:07.460
what have you done?

24:39.170 --> 24:40.250
Bad time?

24:47.830 --> 24:49.420
Keep pushing, Huggies.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.420
I call him Turtleman.

24:52.420 --> 24:53.960
'Cause he slowly
won you over?

24:53.960 --> 24:55.830
Slow and steady
wins the race.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.580
Aah! Gah! Damn it!

25:02.120 --> 25:03.460
Sorry.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.750
Here, take this.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.880
Yo-Yo, stay here,
keep working the door.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.210
Where are you going?

25:10.210 --> 25:11.750
To make sure they don't come
anywhere near you guys.

25:34.460 --> 25:36.670
Where am I?

25:36.670 --> 25:39.080
In a virtual space.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.040
Advantage
of a digital mind.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.460
I mean,
where's my body?

25:43.460 --> 25:45.830
Surrounded by Hunters
in our time ship.

25:45.830 --> 25:47.380
It appears underground,

25:47.380 --> 25:49.920
which is why you've had
difficulty finding it.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.500
And who are you?

25:51.500 --> 25:53.620
Sibyl.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.580
They call me
the Predictor,

25:55.580 --> 25:56.960
but I simply read
the Time Streams.

25:56.960 --> 25:59.420
Are you saying
you see the future?

25:59.420 --> 26:01.620
I see the past

26:01.620 --> 26:03.750
as written
by a single future --

26:03.750 --> 26:05.330
a tree grown,

26:05.330 --> 26:07.710
but also the many trees
it could've grown to be.

26:07.710 --> 26:11.500
A predictor and a poet.
Sweet.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.670
Definitely not like
any Chronicom I've met.

26:13.670 --> 26:15.040
Nor are you.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.620
Again, I'm not a --

26:17.620 --> 26:19.500
You know, people keep
making that mistake today.

26:19.500 --> 26:20.880
But you're not
a person.

26:22.210 --> 26:24.420
What do you think
you are?

26:24.420 --> 26:26.620
One of many
pressing questions.

26:26.620 --> 26:28.830
But you seem to answer
anything I ask.

26:28.830 --> 26:31.080
I see no reason not to.

26:31.080 --> 26:33.120
Then this
should be interesting.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.920
Enoch had you
unconscious

26:35.920 --> 26:37.960
and was implanting something
in your brain.

26:37.960 --> 26:40.500
All of my actions
were completely on the up.

26:40.500 --> 26:42.330
Yeah,
and completely misguided.

26:42.330 --> 26:44.290
Forget what you saw.
Enoch is a friend.

26:44.290 --> 26:47.790
No, no, what I just saw
was Creepytown, USA,

26:47.790 --> 26:49.120
population --
the -- the two of you.

26:49.120 --> 26:50.210
No, no.

26:51.420 --> 26:53.960
I want answers --
real ones.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.960
He was fixing my memory
so we can fix the ship.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.920
Wait a second.
Do you --

27:02.920 --> 27:05.120
Do you not know
how to fix the time machine

27:05.120 --> 27:07.380
that you are currently
ripping apart?

27:07.380 --> 27:09.210
You cannot imagine
how impossible it was

27:09.210 --> 27:10.880
to track the Chronicoms
through time.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.250
But Fitz and I
found a place

27:12.250 --> 27:14.120
where all their moves
could be observed.

27:14.120 --> 27:16.500
And to guide us,
Fitz stayed there.

27:16.500 --> 27:19.170
He is completely exposed,

27:19.170 --> 27:20.830
and they will kill him
if they find him,

27:20.830 --> 27:22.080
so no one can know
his location.

27:23.420 --> 27:25.420
But you knew.

27:25.420 --> 27:28.080
Yes.

27:28.080 --> 27:31.750
I designed a biological implant
to suppress my memories.

27:31.750 --> 27:34.000
I named her Diana.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.960
She's adorable,
and we're inseparable.

27:35.960 --> 27:36.960
Literally.

27:38.250 --> 27:42.790
Ohh. You need to replace
the capacitors.

27:42.790 --> 27:44.920
But then you won't remember
how to find Fitz again.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.210
I'm worried I might.

27:46.210 --> 27:49.500
Diana is acting up,
and I'm...

27:49.500 --> 27:51.330
I'm forgetting the things
I'm supposed to know,

27:51.330 --> 27:52.420
and more dangerously,

27:52.420 --> 27:53.750
I'm remembering
the things I'm not.

27:53.750 --> 27:57.170
We'll fix the implant.

27:57.170 --> 27:58.500
Don't worry.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.420
We're far more likely to blow
a hole through space-time,

28:00.420 --> 28:01.790
then Diana won't matter,
anyway.

28:03.580 --> 28:04.540
Duct tape?

28:08.920 --> 28:11.210
Hey, buddy,
she's not doing good.

28:11.210 --> 28:12.120
You need to get
some help.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.500
Leave me alone.
Help her.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.830
No?

28:20.830 --> 28:22.960
Aah!

28:40.500 --> 28:43.000
Okay. I got you.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.420
Come on.

28:45.830 --> 28:47.080
Here we go.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.540
Is that you?

29:02.330 --> 29:04.750
My bones...

29:04.750 --> 29:07.250
are cracking.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.120
Where's Daisy?

29:11.120 --> 29:14.330
Abducted
by Nathaniel Malick.

29:14.330 --> 29:15.920
He wants
to take her power.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.170
What are the chances
he'll succeed?

29:19.330 --> 29:20.920
22%.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.080
Will Daisy survive?

29:22.080 --> 29:23.710
86%.

29:23.710 --> 29:26.580
That's my girl.

29:26.580 --> 29:28.540
And what do you want
from Mack's parents?

29:28.540 --> 29:29.620
Mack.

29:29.620 --> 29:31.170
To get to us?

29:31.170 --> 29:32.170
So you can have Earth?

29:32.170 --> 29:33.830
You know the answer
to that one.

29:33.830 --> 29:35.420
And why do you want it?

29:35.420 --> 29:37.380
To ensure the survival
of my species.

29:37.380 --> 29:38.960
See?

29:38.960 --> 29:39.880
Me too.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.080
We should talk more.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.460
So much in common.

29:42.460 --> 29:44.500
Neither one of us
is actually speaking.

29:44.500 --> 29:47.920
And a great sense of humor,
too.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.670
So, why you and not us?

29:49.670 --> 29:51.620
Clarify.

29:51.620 --> 29:54.170
What's the difference between
a Chronicom and a human?

29:54.170 --> 29:56.250
Time.

29:56.250 --> 29:57.960
Humans have
a limited amount of it

29:57.960 --> 29:59.460
and therefore fear death.

29:59.460 --> 30:00.830
They act irrationally

30:00.830 --> 30:02.880
to prevent themselves
or others

30:02.880 --> 30:04.460
from experiencing death.

30:04.460 --> 30:06.250
Chronicoms cannot die.

30:06.250 --> 30:08.540
Time has
no consequence.

30:08.540 --> 30:09.750
You should ask yourself

30:09.750 --> 30:11.710
which category
you fall into.

30:11.710 --> 30:12.790
So, that's the difference

30:12.790 --> 30:14.620
that makes your species
more valuable.

30:14.620 --> 30:16.620
Less fleeting.

30:16.620 --> 30:18.460
With a home planet intact,

30:18.460 --> 30:21.420
we will exist
long after you're gone.

30:21.420 --> 30:24.500
Once you realize that,
you'll give up.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.330
Or...you'll run out of --

30:26.330 --> 30:27.750
Time.

30:27.750 --> 30:31.580
Yeah, you said that.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.380
I would argue that you're wrong
about three things,

30:33.380 --> 30:34.460
if you don't mind.

30:34.460 --> 30:35.540
Please.

30:35.540 --> 30:38.290
First...

30:38.290 --> 30:40.710
Coulson: ...the difference
is sacrifice.

30:43.750 --> 30:46.460
Yeah, time is limited...

30:50.420 --> 30:53.710
...which means sacrifice
comes at a real cost...

30:58.540 --> 31:00.790
...not just data.

31:03.210 --> 31:05.330
Heart and pain

31:05.330 --> 31:07.960
and blood and sweat
and tears --

31:07.960 --> 31:10.120
all the good human stuff.

31:10.120 --> 31:13.040
And we will never
give up.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.460
You said I was wrong
about three things.

31:15.460 --> 31:16.540
What's the third?

31:16.540 --> 31:19.710
Me.

31:19.710 --> 31:23.210
You see, I haven't feared death
for a long time.

31:23.210 --> 31:24.710
Is that so?

31:24.710 --> 31:27.210
Yeah.

31:27.210 --> 31:30.000
The fact is, dying...

31:31.460 --> 31:34.420
...it's kind of
my super power.

31:40.040 --> 31:41.120
Chronicom:
Someone's in the Hive.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.250
Get down there
immediately.

31:51.380 --> 31:54.500
May, if you're out there,
I found the ship.

31:54.500 --> 31:56.330
I just hope you're right
about this next part.

32:12.750 --> 32:15.330
Mack:

32:22.290 --> 32:24.580
Looks like my team
just disrupted your lockdown.

32:24.580 --> 32:25.880
It doesn't matter.

32:40.380 --> 32:41.580
Stoner: This is not
how I planned

32:41.580 --> 32:45.380
on spending
Lady Liberty's 200th.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.880
Yo-Yo: What happened?

32:46.880 --> 32:48.460
Coulson lifted
the lockdown.

32:48.460 --> 32:50.540
Okay, we'll head
for the Quinjet.

32:50.540 --> 32:51.830
How bad's your arm?

32:51.830 --> 32:53.500
John: Nothing getting home
won't fix.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.380
Thank you
for believing us.

32:59.380 --> 33:00.880
Thank you
for saving my skin.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.170
That is literal.

33:03.880 --> 33:06.670
I'd like to buy you
a beverage of your choice

33:06.670 --> 33:08.960
if that is
a welcome gesture.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.250
H.R. rules frown on it.

33:11.250 --> 33:13.000
As a saboteur,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.080
you don't technically
report to me, Melinda.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.960
I'm Level 7.

33:16.960 --> 33:18.500
Technically,
you'd report to me.

33:18.500 --> 33:21.540
But your job's
just beginning.

33:21.540 --> 33:24.500
Clear out the base,
create a cover story.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.620
Perhaps
a "Hydrogen Wave Crisis."

33:26.620 --> 33:28.830
Yes, ma'am.

33:28.830 --> 33:30.290
Thank you, General.

33:39.750 --> 33:42.580
This would make
one hell of a report.

33:48.880 --> 33:50.670
Where's Coulson?

33:50.670 --> 33:52.080
He's gone.

33:56.790 --> 33:58.210
Was he
in that explosion?

34:00.170 --> 34:02.000
Is he dead?

34:03.920 --> 34:05.880
He'll come back.

34:05.880 --> 34:08.540
Always does.

34:19.460 --> 34:25.000
Um, yeah, E-Enoch,
I'm sorry...about before.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.170
I-I didn't realize
that things were so dire.

34:27.170 --> 34:28.620
And...?

34:28.620 --> 34:31.460
And...

34:31.460 --> 34:34.580
you are a valued member
of our family.

34:34.580 --> 34:39.960
That is
the greatest compliment

34:39.960 --> 34:42.710
one could be paid.

34:42.710 --> 34:43.710
Apology accepted.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.120
Okay, so,
what do you remember?

34:50.120 --> 34:51.000
Do you know
where Fitz is?

34:55.380 --> 34:57.290
No.

34:57.290 --> 34:59.620
No one can know.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.790
And no one can know
about me.

35:03.790 --> 35:05.250
I mean it, Deke.

35:05.250 --> 35:06.750
Even you knowing
puts you at great risk.

35:10.250 --> 35:12.210
Can you carry
this secret?

35:19.500 --> 35:23.210
63,000 pounds of thrust?

35:23.210 --> 35:24.500
Mm-hmm.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.330
Per turbine.

35:26.330 --> 35:30.080
This baby will scream
straight up into the sky.

35:33.540 --> 35:35.710
And he said,
"Not like that, Mama."

35:37.580 --> 35:41.420
She's telling me
about her sons.

35:41.420 --> 35:44.000
Her oldest
sounds very serious.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.080
You know what I find
loosens kids up?

35:46.080 --> 35:49.750
Now, just --
just hear me out.

35:49.750 --> 35:53.880
Um...ATV's.

35:53.880 --> 35:58.420
I-I don't know if anyone's
said this yet, but...

35:58.420 --> 36:00.710
thank you
for saving us.

36:00.710 --> 36:02.580
You're welcome.

36:13.670 --> 36:15.460
John:
What are we talking about?

36:15.460 --> 36:17.170
Lilla: ATVs.

36:17.170 --> 36:19.170
The Hugger thinks
we should get one for the boys.

36:19.170 --> 36:20.290
I think
it's a terrible idea.

36:20.290 --> 36:21.080
For Alfie?

36:22.460 --> 36:23.920
Why are we circling?

36:23.920 --> 36:25.670
I can't take them
to the Zephyr.

36:25.670 --> 36:27.120
Why?

36:27.120 --> 36:28.500
I felt nothing
from him...

36:28.500 --> 36:29.460
like Coulson.

36:29.460 --> 36:30.710
No.

36:31.750 --> 36:32.960
Check his arm.

36:32.960 --> 36:35.210
You said he hurt it.

36:35.210 --> 36:38.170
No, no.
He can't be one of them.

36:38.170 --> 36:39.880
We got there in time
before anything could happen.

36:43.330 --> 36:46.170
I know what you're feeling,
and I'm sorry.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.580
But you know
it might be true.

36:50.580 --> 36:52.580
Check his arm.

36:52.580 --> 36:54.210
Wait.
What's going on?

36:55.710 --> 36:57.750
Uh, what's going on?

36:57.750 --> 36:58.830
Why are we turning?

37:02.880 --> 37:04.040
John...

37:06.290 --> 37:07.710
...you mind if I take a look
at your arm?

37:07.710 --> 37:09.790
What?

37:09.790 --> 37:11.790
Uh, no.
It's fine.

37:11.790 --> 37:13.290
Why aren't we going home?

37:13.290 --> 37:15.620
It's okay.
We'll be there soon.

37:15.620 --> 37:19.000
Let's show May
that you're all good.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.750
Can you please just
show me your arm, sir?

37:22.750 --> 37:24.750
Really...

37:24.750 --> 37:26.250
it-- it's nothing.

37:31.540 --> 37:34.330
John...

37:34.330 --> 37:35.670
I need to see it.

37:37.750 --> 37:39.210
Leave him alone.

37:39.210 --> 37:43.330
No, sweetheart,
it's fine.

37:48.830 --> 37:50.750
It's just a scratch,
really.

38:01.460 --> 38:03.330
What'd you do
with my parents?

38:03.330 --> 38:05.290
They've been gone
a while.

38:19.830 --> 38:22.460
I harvested
their skins.

38:22.460 --> 38:24.670
We could have had
so much fun together, son.

38:46.620 --> 38:47.710
Hang on!

38:59.460 --> 39:00.710
Don't do it, Mack.

39:00.710 --> 39:02.750
Mack...

39:02.750 --> 39:05.540
Alfie...

40:10.830 --> 40:12.880
We're about to jump.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.120
Last chance, if you...

40:19.000 --> 40:21.620
I'm where I need to be.

40:57.120 --> 40:58.040
Where are you going,
man?

41:01.960 --> 41:03.580
Mack!

41:03.580 --> 41:04.880
I just need some air.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.500
Simmons:
Deke, where are you?

41:32.330 --> 41:34.420
Hey, I said
I would check on Mack.

41:34.420 --> 41:37.960
Believe it or not, I kind of get
what he's going through.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.620
No, where are you?

41:39.620 --> 41:41.000
The Zephyr's...leaving.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.880
Both of you get back now.

41:42.880 --> 41:44.120
...deteriorating...

41:44.120 --> 41:45.290
...about to jump...

41:49.920 --> 41:51.750
Mack!

41:51.750 --> 41:53.540
Mack! Mack!

41:53.540 --> 41:56.210
Mack, we gotta go!
Z1's in trouble!
