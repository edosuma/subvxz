00:26.659 --> 00:28.961
Lillian: <i>The medical community</i>
<i>has always</i>

00:28.963 --> 00:32.965
<i>Been fascinated</i>
<i>by freaks of nature.</i>

00:32.967 --> 00:37.669
They highlight the strange
wonders of the human body,

00:37.671 --> 00:42.975
And illuminate the horrors
of disease and disorder,

00:42.977 --> 00:44.510
Death.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.145
For these poor souls,

00:46.147 --> 00:48.981
Halloween must have
come as a great relief.

00:48.983 --> 00:53.152
The one ordained day they were
allowed to hide behind costumes.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.687
And here at the american
morbidity museum,

00:55.689 --> 00:58.157
We not only embrace
their differences,

00:58.159 --> 01:00.692
We celebrate them.
(chuckles)

01:00.694 --> 01:03.529
So, please
have some candy.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.998
Enjoy that,
enjoy the tour.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.401
See you in
the next room.

01:10.503 --> 01:12.337
Dr. Mansfield.
Miss hemmings.

01:12.339 --> 01:14.339
Have you met my lab
assistant miss rothschild?

01:14.341 --> 01:15.541
Oh.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.843
She may be my
brightest pupil yet.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.345
Oh. That's not true.
Now, we don't mean to rush you,

01:20.347 --> 01:22.714
But we do have a bona fide
offer that expires in an hour.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.183
Did your appraiser
look at the specimen?

01:24.185 --> 01:27.019
He has.

01:27.021 --> 01:29.088
Let me go get him.

01:33.226 --> 01:35.027
These poor people.

01:35.029 --> 01:37.729
Doomed to lie here
and be gawked at all day.

01:37.731 --> 01:41.200
Well, they were
losers in life.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.635
At least now
they have some value.

01:44.704 --> 01:46.205
Careful.

01:46.207 --> 01:49.041
The smithsonian offered me
$500 for that.

01:49.043 --> 01:50.209
Then they're a bunch of fools.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.077
I beg your
pardon, sir.

01:52.079 --> 01:55.881
I have a double degree
from harvard university.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.883
You can't talk
to me like that.
Yes, about your double degree.

01:57.885 --> 02:02.588
We called harvard, asking
after a sylvester mansfield.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.756
They have no record of you.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.225
Did you know
that it's a felony

02:06.227 --> 02:07.893
To sell a fraudulent
medical specimen?

02:07.895 --> 02:09.561
We have every right
to call the police.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.096
And I will call

02:11.098 --> 02:12.898
The    <i>new engld</i>
<i>journal of medicine.</i>

02:12.900 --> 02:15.067
I'll tell them how rudely
we've been treated here.

02:15.069 --> 02:17.402
I brought you an
authentic baby sasquatch.

02:17.404 --> 02:21.106
It is a fetal goat with the jaw
of a cat sewn onto it.

02:21.108 --> 02:23.075
A what?! This is outrageous.

02:23.077 --> 02:25.244
We're leaving.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.912
Oh.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.148
Take your sasquatch with you.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.754
(clears throat)
you're obviously

02:35.756 --> 02:37.623
Inventive people.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.626
If you brought me
something authentic,

02:40.628 --> 02:43.295
Something truly
priceless, I...

02:43.297 --> 02:46.131
Well, I wouldn't ask
many questions.

02:46.133 --> 02:48.600
In fact,

02:48.602 --> 02:50.135
My business is in trouble.

02:50.137 --> 02:53.105
Without new exhibits,
even our most loyal patrons

02:53.107 --> 02:56.275
Would rather stay at home
and watch <i>ed sullivan.</i>
<i>(chuckles)</i>

02:56.277 --> 02:57.943
Where does this stuff come from?

02:57.945 --> 03:01.180
All over.
Private collectors, and...

03:02.782 --> 03:05.284
And, you know, I used
to get calls from freak shows

03:05.286 --> 03:08.954
When one of theirs would pass,
but they're mostly gone now.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.323
Just maybe one or two.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.125
Um...

03:13.127 --> 03:16.195
Coney island and south florida.

03:18.131 --> 03:21.133
What's this over here?

03:21.135 --> 03:23.168
Oh.

03:23.170 --> 03:28.307
The conjoined liver of famed
siamese twins chang and eng.

03:28.309 --> 03:31.176
Just the liver?

03:31.178 --> 03:32.844
How much is that worth?

03:32.846 --> 03:34.213
$5,000.

03:36.349 --> 03:39.318
That's fascinating.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.986
Well,

03:40.988 --> 03:43.155
We have to catch
our plane.
Catch our train.

03:43.157 --> 03:44.323
Oh.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.524
Have a lovely day.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.492
You, as well.

03:47.494 --> 03:50.329
Coney island's a little
cold this time of year.

03:50.331 --> 03:53.065
How about florida?

05:01.434 --> 05:03.235
Child: Trick or treat.
(man laughs maniacally)

05:03.237 --> 05:04.436
(child screams)

05:04.438 --> 05:06.972
Child:
Trick or treat!

05:16.249 --> 05:19.418
Jessie, go up
and get some candy.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.253
I want to wait.

05:21.255 --> 05:22.754
(children screaming)

05:22.756 --> 05:25.157
(laughs)

05:28.428 --> 05:30.595
What was that all about?

05:30.597 --> 05:32.597
She's terrified
of clowns.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.433
So guess what her
brother dressed as.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.268
I had to drag
her to come out

05:36.270 --> 05:38.270
And go trick-or-treating.

05:38.272 --> 05:39.971
Kids.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.441
It seems like a good
idea at the time.

05:42.443 --> 05:45.277
Jane:
<i>Is it me, or is it</i>

05:45.279 --> 05:46.445
Much more crowded
this year?

05:46.447 --> 05:48.447
It's those kids
from jupiter.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.649
No trick-or-treating
because of the curfew.

05:50.651 --> 05:53.118
Hmm. I thought
they caught the guy.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.354
Some circus
performer?
Mm.

05:56.622 --> 05:58.690
(brush rustling)

06:06.632 --> 06:08.700
(gasps)

06:10.470 --> 06:12.637
Jessie.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.840
I saw a clown.
It was a really scary one.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.641
Remember what we talked about?
How sometimes

06:16.643 --> 06:18.643
We can get confused
because of our imagination?

06:18.645 --> 06:20.145
He was real.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.146
It's Halloween, jessie.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.147
There's clowns everywhere.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.482
Now, come on.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.817
Let's go get some more candy
with these kids.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.319
(sighs)

06:27.321 --> 06:28.820
I swear, I'll never
understand that girl.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.889
I find clowns delightful.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.444
(gate creaks)

06:54.380 --> 06:56.515
Ethel:
<i>Ow.</i>

06:56.517 --> 06:58.116
(inhales sharply)

07:01.354 --> 07:04.356
You're awful quiet.

07:04.358 --> 07:07.526
That must mean the biopsy
came back positive.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.361
Uh, yes.

07:09.363 --> 07:12.364
You tested positive
for cirrhosis of the liver.

07:12.366 --> 07:16.368
It says here that there's
a good deal of fibrosis.

07:16.370 --> 07:19.704
Yeah, well, my liver's
tough as an old boot.

07:19.706 --> 07:22.374
We can fix her
up, can't we?

07:22.376 --> 07:24.976
I don't think so.

07:26.879 --> 07:30.549
Well, I ain't touched a drop
since jimmy's 18th birthday.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.083
Well, you could've had this
for a long time.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.552
Cirrhosis can be sneaky.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.922
Well, I ain't gonna die
anytime soon, am I?

07:36.924 --> 07:39.491
I never liked that question.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.729
I believe hope
is strong medicine.

07:44.731 --> 07:48.567
I don't like to tell patients
to, uh, give up hope.

07:48.569 --> 07:51.736
Eh, we're all hopeless, doc.

07:51.738 --> 07:55.106
We're all gonna die.

07:55.108 --> 07:59.411
Pardon me, miss,
but the older I get,

07:59.413 --> 08:02.247
The harder it gets for me
to deliver the bad news.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.415
Never been good at it.

08:03.417 --> 08:06.084
Especially for someone
like yourself,

08:06.086 --> 08:08.086
Who must have had
a hard life

08:08.088 --> 08:10.956
And seen the worst
in human nature.

08:10.958 --> 08:15.026
Eh, I got plenty
to be grateful for.

08:17.964 --> 08:20.265
Give it to me straight.

08:20.267 --> 08:21.633
How long have I got?

08:21.635 --> 08:23.935
Anywhere from six months

08:23.937 --> 08:25.704
To a year.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.711
Well, shit.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.719
Shit. Shit. Shit.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.458
Ain't nothing we can do, huh?

08:46.460 --> 08:48.460
Keep the meat to a minimum.

08:48.462 --> 08:50.662
And don't take

08:50.664 --> 08:53.164
A single drop of alcohol.

08:53.166 --> 08:56.234
That'll only
accelerate things.

09:02.141 --> 09:04.142
I'm sorry.

09:04.144 --> 09:07.479
I just couldn't be more sorry.

09:07.481 --> 09:11.182
Really.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.651
You know what, doc?

09:12.653 --> 09:14.653
(sniffles)

09:14.655 --> 09:17.722
I ain't crying 'cause
you told me I'm gonna die.

09:20.159 --> 09:22.994
I'm crying 'cause
you're the f...

09:22.996 --> 09:27.265
You're the first doctor ever
treat me with respect.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.168
(sniffles)

09:30.170 --> 09:32.671
I just c-can't help thinking

09:32.673 --> 09:37.576
My whole life might have gone
different if I'd met you sooner.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.589
(laughter, lively music playing)

09:56.028 --> 09:57.529
Paul: Hey, come on,
suzi, have a go!

09:57.531 --> 09:58.530
(laughing)

09:58.532 --> 10:01.299
Whoa!

10:03.369 --> 10:05.437
Whoa! (laughs)

10:06.872 --> 10:08.707
Hey, come on, girls!

10:08.709 --> 10:11.242
Between the two of you, you
could win this game in one dunk!

10:11.244 --> 10:12.711
No, thank you.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.613
We just washed
our hair.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.083
Where have you been?

10:18.085 --> 10:20.218
I was digging a grave.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.120
For meep.

10:23.222 --> 10:25.090
He was a child.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.391
They all are.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.560
I can't protect any of them.

10:28.562 --> 10:30.729
You can't blame yourself.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.564
Why not?

10:32.566 --> 10:35.634
They needed a leader
and I failed them.

10:41.107 --> 10:42.941
Stop!

10:42.943 --> 10:45.577
Stop it! What's
wrong with you all?!

10:45.579 --> 10:47.579
(music stops)
bette: Dot.

10:47.581 --> 10:49.581
Meep is dead!

10:49.583 --> 10:51.082
Don't you care?!

10:51.084 --> 10:53.585
You're being
disrespectful.

10:53.587 --> 10:56.621
Look how much
pain jimmy's in.

10:56.623 --> 10:58.590
This is wrong!

10:58.592 --> 11:01.593
We should remember meep
by working even harder.

11:01.595 --> 11:04.596
Maybe dedicating the show
today to his memory.

11:04.598 --> 11:05.597
The show?

11:05.599 --> 11:08.600
It's Halloween.

11:08.602 --> 11:10.602
No freak performs on Halloween.

11:10.604 --> 11:13.138
Any idiot knows that.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.439
It's not fair. They're new.
They don't know

11:14.441 --> 11:15.440
About that old superstition.

11:15.442 --> 11:16.975
Not superstition.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.777
It's true.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.445
Bette:
What is?

11:20.447 --> 11:22.781
Why we don't perform
on Halloween.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.616
On accounts
of edward mordrake.

11:24.618 --> 11:26.284
Who?

11:26.286 --> 11:27.952
Edward mordrake.

11:27.954 --> 11:32.624
Aristocrat who lived
in the middle 1800s.

11:32.626 --> 11:35.627
He was heir to all
kinds of titles.

11:35.629 --> 11:38.296
Could've been a duke
or a lord or some shit,

11:38.298 --> 11:39.831
Things had been different.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.867
Things are never different.

11:46.138 --> 11:48.339
<i>An englishman of noble birth,</i>

11:48.341 --> 11:50.809
<i>Edward was a young man</i>
<i>with fine attainments.</i>

11:50.811 --> 11:52.177
<i>He was a scholar.</i>

11:52.179 --> 11:53.678
<i>He was a poet.</i>

11:53.680 --> 11:55.013
<i>Musician of rare ability.</i>

11:55.015 --> 11:57.482
Dot:
<i>So what was wrong with him?</i>

11:57.484 --> 12:00.318
Ethel: <i>He had another face</i>
<i>on the back of his head.</i>

12:00.320 --> 12:01.820
<i>Hideous as a devil.</i>

12:01.822 --> 12:04.322
No one else could
hear what it said,

12:04.324 --> 12:06.324
But it whispered
to edward incessantly

12:06.326 --> 12:09.661
<i>Of things</i>
<i>only spoken of in hell.</i>

12:09.663 --> 12:11.730
(indistinct whispering)

12:16.669 --> 12:19.671
<i>He tried to kill it.</i>

12:19.673 --> 12:21.573
(whispering stops)

12:22.508 --> 12:24.576
(water gurgling)

12:26.512 --> 12:28.680
<i>Many times in many ways.</i>

12:28.682 --> 12:30.849
<i>But it wouldn't die.</i>

12:30.851 --> 12:32.684
So what happened to him?

12:32.686 --> 12:34.853
He went mad.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.722
His family had him committed

12:37.724 --> 12:39.858
To the crazy house at bedlam.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.393
Truth be told, they were
only too happy to have

12:42.395 --> 12:45.396
The family freak
banished from sight.

12:45.398 --> 12:48.199
<i>In the crazy house,</i>
<i>he wrote poetry.</i>

12:48.201 --> 12:49.868
<i>Worked on an unfinished opera.</i>

12:49.870 --> 12:52.537
<i>Anything to keep his mind off</i>

12:52.539 --> 12:56.207
<i>The demon whisperings,</i>
<i>but he never got any relief.</i>

12:56.209 --> 12:59.043
It was telling him to do things.

12:59.045 --> 13:00.645
Commanding him.

13:00.647 --> 13:02.881
<i>One night,</i>

13:02.883 --> 13:05.450
<i>Edward escaped the asylum.</i>

13:13.893 --> 13:17.061
<i>And he ended up</i>
<i>where we all do.</i>

13:17.063 --> 13:18.730
<i>At the freak show.</i>

13:18.732 --> 13:21.566
They billed him
as the two faced prince.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.067
And he'd show off

13:23.069 --> 13:25.436
All the refined skills
he'd learned as the scion

13:25.438 --> 13:28.740
Of one of England's
grand families.

13:28.742 --> 13:30.275
And then he'd take a bow.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.176
(screams)

13:35.080 --> 13:36.948
And he was happy?

13:36.950 --> 13:40.118
He'd found a home
with others like himself.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.922
There was no one like edward.

13:43.924 --> 13:46.090
He wasn't happy.

13:46.092 --> 13:49.594
One Halloween night,

13:49.596 --> 13:51.129
Edward snapped.

13:51.131 --> 13:54.532
<i>He murdered every freak</i>
<i>in the troupe.</i>

14:02.441 --> 14:04.509
<i>And then he hung himself.</i>

14:08.781 --> 14:10.615
<i>Legend has it</i>
<i>that even in death,</i>

14:10.617 --> 14:14.485
<i>The demon face was smiling.</i>

14:14.487 --> 14:18.323
So, we don't perform
on Halloween night

14:18.325 --> 14:19.791
Out of respect?

14:19.793 --> 14:21.793
Paul:
Out of fear, darling.

14:21.795 --> 14:23.795
If any freak performs
on Halloween,

14:23.797 --> 14:26.130
They summon the spirit
of edward mordrake

14:26.132 --> 14:28.800
And his demon half-face.

14:28.802 --> 14:32.637
Once he appears,
he never leaves alone.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.139
That whispering face
will choose one more freak

14:35.141 --> 14:36.975
To take with him back to hell.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.143
What a bunch of bunk!

14:39.145 --> 14:40.812
What are you trying
to scare them for?

14:40.814 --> 14:42.180
It's not bunk.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.648
It's true.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.516
I can swear to it.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.518
In '32, when I was
with barnum,

14:47.520 --> 14:49.487
They made us perform
on Halloween.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.989
Well...

14:50.991 --> 14:53.992
Something visited
the circus grounds that night.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.361
'cause the next morning,
clyde hendershot,

14:56.363 --> 14:58.997
The astounding human cannonball,

14:58.999 --> 15:00.765
All three feet,
four inches of him,

15:00.767 --> 15:03.368
Was found hanging
in his caravan.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.669
Yup.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.838
His head twisted clean around.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.874
His dead eyes staring backwards.

15:09.876 --> 15:12.176
A smile on his face.

15:12.178 --> 15:15.580
Just like edward mordrake's
second face.

15:18.684 --> 15:19.751
Enough.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.560
Hey.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.029
What?

15:31.031 --> 15:33.031
What the hell was
all that about?

15:33.033 --> 15:33.865
Carny lore.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.533
Not that.
The drinking!

15:35.535 --> 15:37.368
Ma, you swore off the stuff.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.037
Well, I'm swearing back on.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.239
Why? What is it-- dell?

15:41.241 --> 15:43.041
You been on edge
ever since he got here.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.042
You don't know shit!

15:44.044 --> 15:45.543
Matter of fact,

15:45.545 --> 15:46.711
I'm glad he's here.

15:46.713 --> 15:47.879
We need a man
around this dump.

15:47.881 --> 15:50.148
Means you're free to go.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.051
Oh, don't give me that look.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.119
You know you been
itching to take off.

16:03.228 --> 16:05.229
Gloria: Dora?
(clock chiming)

16:05.231 --> 16:07.432
I need your help.

16:07.434 --> 16:10.068
It's almost sundown.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.904
Why do I got
to be a bird this year?

16:12.906 --> 16:15.740
Because woody woodpecker
is dandy's favorite cartoon.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.575
Have you practiced?

16:17.577 --> 16:20.578
(imitates
woody woodpecker's laugh)

16:20.580 --> 16:21.612
That'll do in a pinch.

16:21.614 --> 16:22.914
Do you think

16:22.916 --> 16:24.115
This will cheer him up?

16:24.117 --> 16:26.084
Here he comes.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.919
Ask him yourself.

16:27.921 --> 16:30.088
How was your nap, darling?

16:30.090 --> 16:32.757
Are you ready
for some Halloween fun?

16:32.759 --> 16:34.292
Yes. I can't wait to go

16:34.294 --> 16:35.927
Trick-or-treating
and terrorize the neighborhood.

16:35.929 --> 16:37.762
There's a curfew.
No one's going out.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.765
Curfews are for the poor people.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.934
We can have
our own Halloween here.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.936
We'll have a costume contest.

16:44.938 --> 16:47.472
Can you guess who I am?

16:47.474 --> 16:48.606
Doris duke.

16:48.608 --> 16:49.974
Again.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.109
(laughs)
dandy, you're so clever.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.477
Dora?

16:52.479 --> 16:55.146
Bring out dandy's costume.

16:55.148 --> 16:59.350
Dora worked on it for a month,
with my guidance, of course.

17:03.956 --> 17:06.023
Howdy doody?

17:12.131 --> 17:13.964
Howdy doody!

17:13.967 --> 17:15.967
You ungrateful little...
Dora, if dandy doesn't

17:15.969 --> 17:18.136
Like his costume,
we'll make another.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.503
There's no time
for that, mother!

17:19.506 --> 17:21.005
I'll go into town and buy one.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.640
I think I can make it
if I still hurry.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.641
(screams)

17:23.643 --> 17:24.976
Your mother might be

17:24.978 --> 17:27.145
Afraid of you, but I'm not.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.647
Clean up this mess, maid.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.049
I work for miss gloria.

17:38.824 --> 17:40.892
¶

18:05.017 --> 18:09.020
Halloween was meep's
favorite holiday.

18:09.022 --> 18:11.022
He loved to dress up.

18:11.024 --> 18:15.693
Hear the screams of the...
Of the kids when he'd sneak

18:15.695 --> 18:17.929
The occasional chicken head
in their bag of candy.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.199
It was the one day

18:21.201 --> 18:23.101
He felt like he could be
one of them.

18:26.205 --> 18:30.041
But we know this man.

18:30.043 --> 18:32.710
And he wasn't one of them.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.613
He was better.

18:38.383 --> 18:40.118
We'll all miss you, meep.

18:43.255 --> 18:45.423
Here's to you, meep.

18:45.425 --> 18:48.059
It's a little something
to lighten the load

18:48.061 --> 18:50.128
As you walk through
the valley of the shadows.

18:58.237 --> 18:59.737
Amen.

18:59.739 --> 19:00.605
Amen.

19:00.607 --> 19:03.141
Amen.
Amen.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.127
Jimmy:
We're closed.

19:23.129 --> 19:24.929
There's no show today.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.265
Oh.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.267
I'm not a customer.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.768
I'm looking for a job.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.303
Here?

19:32.305 --> 19:33.938
You made a mistake.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.273
Believe me, you
don't belong here.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.341
I came all the way
from philadelphia.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.112
My name is
mystic miss esmeralda.

19:41.114 --> 19:43.114
I'm a fortune teller.

19:43.116 --> 19:44.549
(chuckles)

19:54.326 --> 19:57.295
(bette crying)

19:57.297 --> 19:59.964
Bette:
I never agreed to this!

19:59.966 --> 20:02.133
You're being selfish.

20:02.135 --> 20:04.802
I have talent.

20:04.804 --> 20:05.970
And a man who wants
to marry me

20:05.972 --> 20:08.139
And have babies.

20:08.141 --> 20:10.308
It's all coming true.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.343
But none of it is possible
with you here.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.979
He'll never marry you.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.180
Without me, you're just another

20:16.182 --> 20:18.049
Plain jane with big dreams.
Oh.

20:23.855 --> 20:25.156
Oh, my god.
I've decided to use

20:25.158 --> 20:27.158
The luck bone saw.
What is that?

20:27.160 --> 20:31.162
It's the first motorized
bone-cutting device

20:31.164 --> 20:33.164
That can be
sterilized repeatedly

20:33.166 --> 20:34.332
Without damaging
the drive train.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.667
Please no.
Oh, it'll be over

20:36.669 --> 20:38.002
Before you even feel anything.
I told you.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.171
Tell her, doctor.

20:40.173 --> 20:42.506
Please don't!

20:42.508 --> 20:43.541
I'm begging you!

20:43.543 --> 20:44.875
Count backwards
from a hundred.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.677
Please don't.
(gas hissing)

20:46.679 --> 20:48.012
Thank you, god,

20:48.014 --> 20:49.680
For making me separate

20:49.682 --> 20:51.515
And whole.

20:51.517 --> 20:53.884
And please...

20:53.886 --> 20:56.420
Take good care of bette.

21:02.194 --> 21:04.695
Bette:
<i>Wake up, dot.</i>

21:04.697 --> 21:06.197
<i>Wake up.</i>

21:06.199 --> 21:08.532
Wake up.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.201
(panting)

21:10.203 --> 21:13.371
I was having
the most beautiful dream.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.539
Why did you wake me?

21:15.541 --> 21:18.209
Because I was trapped
inside that dream,

21:18.211 --> 21:19.877
And for me it
was a nightmare.

21:19.879 --> 21:23.381
You can't hold me
responsible for my dreams.

21:23.383 --> 21:27.118
It wasn't a dream the last
time you tried to kill me.

21:31.223 --> 21:33.624
Aren't you afraid
you'd miss me?

21:35.727 --> 21:38.562
I'd miss you.

21:38.564 --> 21:41.232
Mean as you are sometimes.

21:41.234 --> 21:43.734
Although sometimes
I wonder

21:43.736 --> 21:46.404
Who you are since we came here.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.406
I'll tell you
who I am.

21:48.408 --> 21:52.243
I'm someone who's not afraid
to do what it takes.

21:52.245 --> 21:56.580
I'm going to work hard,
save my money and find a doctor

21:56.582 --> 21:58.816
Who will do that surgery.

22:04.790 --> 22:08.426
This life isn't making
either one of us happy, bette.

22:08.428 --> 22:11.262
But one of us will die.

22:11.264 --> 22:15.766
And one of us has
a chance at happiness.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.268
(sniffles)

22:17.270 --> 22:19.370
(crying)

22:20.439 --> 22:22.506
(woman singing in german
over speakers)

22:34.953 --> 22:36.821
(exhales)

22:36.823 --> 22:38.289
Every fortune teller

22:38.291 --> 22:43.294
I've ever met
came with a darker complexion.

22:43.296 --> 22:44.628
She's not gypsy,

22:44.630 --> 22:47.998
But I think
she's the real thing.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.800
(chuckles)

22:49.802 --> 22:52.136
You let me be the judge.

22:52.138 --> 22:56.374
I'm not so easily distracted
by a pretty face.

22:57.809 --> 22:59.377
(softly):
Go.

23:05.317 --> 23:07.651
So, you're a fortune teller?

23:07.653 --> 23:09.720
I didn't choose the gift, elsa.

23:11.990 --> 23:14.725
It chose me.

23:17.496 --> 23:19.330
Show me, esmeralda.

23:19.332 --> 23:22.099
Tell me my future.

23:26.838 --> 23:28.906
(sighs)

23:40.385 --> 23:42.920
(sighs)

23:55.367 --> 23:57.735
Spirits are like shadows
at night.

23:57.737 --> 24:00.371
Invisible without
a guiding light.

24:00.373 --> 24:03.374
They only speak if they sense
a receptive audience.

24:03.376 --> 24:05.075
Open your heart,

24:05.077 --> 24:07.044
Elsa.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.947
Listen to their words.

24:12.083 --> 24:14.285
(sighs)

24:15.387 --> 24:17.388
I see many dark tidings.

24:17.390 --> 24:23.427
In the past,
you suffered a grave injustice.

24:23.429 --> 24:26.397
A terrible wrong.

24:26.399 --> 24:30.801
All because of greed
and jealousy.

24:33.071 --> 24:35.940
Yeah.

24:35.942 --> 24:38.409
A woman.

24:38.411 --> 24:40.478
She looks like you.

24:42.247 --> 24:44.315
Music.

24:46.585 --> 24:49.420
Your voice,

24:49.422 --> 24:51.589
So clear, so...

24:51.591 --> 24:53.157
So strong. I can hear them now.

24:54.593 --> 24:56.327
An ovation. (chuckles)

24:58.597 --> 25:01.432
But not for you.

25:04.436 --> 25:05.870
Marlene.

25:07.105 --> 25:09.106
That bitch.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.108
She stole my career.

25:11.110 --> 25:15.779
You see that
in the ball?

25:15.781 --> 25:17.448
Hmm?

25:17.450 --> 25:20.451
She's gone.

25:20.453 --> 25:23.621
But I can hear
another song now.

25:23.623 --> 25:27.291
The future.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.026
(sighs)

25:30.462 --> 25:32.630
It's your song, elsa,
and it's...

25:32.632 --> 25:35.799
It's the most
heartbreaking music

25:35.801 --> 25:37.801
I've ever heard.

25:37.803 --> 25:39.470
(crowd cheering faintly)

25:39.472 --> 25:41.171
They're cheering now.

25:41.173 --> 25:44.475
The applause sounds
like thunder.

25:44.477 --> 25:47.645
For me?

25:47.647 --> 25:49.713
Is there still a chance?

25:52.817 --> 25:54.818
It's never too late.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.488
You're like the aster

25:57.490 --> 25:59.256
That blooms in the fall.

26:01.660 --> 26:03.894
I see a man standing
behind you.

26:05.530 --> 26:06.864
Who is it?

26:06.866 --> 26:10.534
An-an elegant, refined...

26:10.536 --> 26:12.703
Stranger.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.838
With dark hair and...

26:14.840 --> 26:17.174
And piercing eyes.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.676
An impresario.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.177
Under his guidance,

26:20.179 --> 26:22.179
He'll make you a star.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.180
(chuckles)

26:23.182 --> 26:24.682
(sighs)

26:24.684 --> 26:25.583
Oh!

26:26.851 --> 26:28.586
Esmeralda?

26:31.856 --> 26:33.924
You're hired.

26:37.696 --> 26:39.763
(grunting)

26:41.900 --> 26:45.035
Trick or treat?

26:45.037 --> 26:46.537
Wowee.

26:46.539 --> 26:48.606
(chuckles)

26:49.708 --> 26:51.709
Oh, no, none for me,
sweet cheeks.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.544
Got to stay sharp.

26:53.546 --> 26:55.379
(laughs)

26:55.381 --> 26:56.580
Mm-hmm.

26:56.582 --> 26:58.215
Looking good, sugar.

26:58.217 --> 27:02.386
Ooh, coming down here
and taking over!

27:02.388 --> 27:03.787
(giggles)

27:05.390 --> 27:07.558
(panting)

27:07.560 --> 27:09.560
This place is gonna
be good for us.

27:09.562 --> 27:11.595
I can feel it.

27:11.597 --> 27:12.896
Ooh!

27:12.898 --> 27:14.932
(moaning)

27:14.934 --> 27:17.568
Oh, baby.

27:17.570 --> 27:20.638
Ooh, I've missed you.

27:30.582 --> 27:32.650
Oh, yeah.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.488
Oh, yeah.

27:45.597 --> 27:47.598
Ah, damn it.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.600
Oh.

27:49.602 --> 27:51.435
Sorry, baby.

27:51.437 --> 27:53.103
It's all the weight lifting

27:53.105 --> 27:54.772
Has got the blood rushing
to other places.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.607
Not again, dell.

27:56.609 --> 27:58.776
I can't take
this shit no more.

27:58.778 --> 28:01.445
It's just...
You came on too strong.

28:01.447 --> 28:02.780
You got to give me some time.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.281
Heard it all before.

28:04.283 --> 28:08.452
Too much hooch,
too tired, too cold.

28:08.454 --> 28:10.120
I could get more satisfaction
from a doorknob.

28:10.122 --> 28:12.122
(grunting)

28:12.124 --> 28:13.991
You should be kissing
my boots.

28:13.993 --> 28:17.127
I deserve some goddamn respect!

28:17.129 --> 28:19.463
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be in the gutter.

28:19.465 --> 28:23.867
Get your paws off of me,
or you'll never see me again.

28:27.639 --> 28:30.708
(panting)

28:33.144 --> 28:35.212
Desi...

28:38.850 --> 28:41.552
(door creaks, closes)

28:46.825 --> 28:48.892
(organ playing in distance)

28:52.330 --> 28:53.997
Son of a bitch!

28:53.999 --> 28:57.501
Whew, somebody's mad
at somebody.

28:57.503 --> 28:59.670
Fight with
triple tits?

28:59.672 --> 29:00.738
Hey!

29:02.507 --> 29:04.341
Don't you talk
like that about her.

29:04.343 --> 29:05.843
(chuckles)
come on.

29:05.845 --> 29:08.245
Sit down,
share some hooch.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.689
I need to talk
to you anyway.

29:18.691 --> 29:21.525
I got a favor to ask.

29:21.527 --> 29:23.894
Drunk and asking for favors?

29:23.896 --> 29:26.230
That's not the ethel
I seem to remember.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.198
What was the fight
about, anyway?

29:28.200 --> 29:29.600
Couldn't get it up?

29:30.702 --> 29:32.970
It's none of your business.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.908
What was our problem,
you think?

29:37.910 --> 29:40.210
Well, you got a beard,
for starters.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.979
(chuckles)

29:43.715 --> 29:48.786
So, when we conceived jimmy,
you didn't love me at all?

29:51.256 --> 29:53.557
Come on, dell, fess up.

29:53.559 --> 29:54.892
(chuckles)

29:54.894 --> 29:55.893
Nah.

29:55.895 --> 29:59.429
Don't you know
that men will jump

29:59.431 --> 30:01.498
On the first available pussy?

30:04.736 --> 30:06.770
I could've been a better dad.

30:06.772 --> 30:10.440
Well, that's the damn truth.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.109
Yeah, listen,

30:12.111 --> 30:15.746
He is never, ever to
know you're his pa.

30:15.748 --> 30:18.916
Never.

30:18.918 --> 30:20.918
You got that?
You're a broken record, ethel.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.753
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

30:22.755 --> 30:26.256
W-when we was talking
about moving to the burbs,

30:26.258 --> 30:29.660
And I showed you that brochure
for levittown...

30:31.930 --> 30:33.597
...Why'd you lead me on?

30:33.599 --> 30:36.667
I led you on
for about five minutes.

30:37.602 --> 30:39.770
I felt guilty.

30:39.772 --> 30:41.939
Well, we...

30:41.941 --> 30:44.775
We never would've made it
out there, anyway.

30:44.777 --> 30:48.278
Cookie cutter was never
in our cards.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.781
What's with all
the questions, ethel?

30:50.783 --> 30:53.617
What, is the booze
getting you sentimental?

30:53.619 --> 30:56.787
Jimmy's lost.

30:56.789 --> 30:58.789
Your son is floundering.

30:58.791 --> 31:02.459
He's got one foot in this
life, one foot out there.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.795
Well, from what I can see,
he listens to you pretty good.

31:04.797 --> 31:07.231
Well... I'm dying.

31:08.166 --> 31:09.800
Yep.

31:09.802 --> 31:12.135
With any luck,
it'll be sooner than later.

31:12.137 --> 31:14.972
He's gonna need some guidance,

31:14.974 --> 31:17.140
And preferably
from a man.

31:17.142 --> 31:19.810
Come on, can't you be decent?

31:19.812 --> 31:21.845
Keep-keep an eye on him,

31:21.847 --> 31:23.981
For christ's sake?

31:23.983 --> 31:24.982
Make him get out

31:24.984 --> 31:27.017
In the world I was afraid of,

31:27.019 --> 31:29.386
Make something out of himself.

31:32.357 --> 31:34.725
Weird.

31:36.327 --> 31:39.997
You know what I was wondering
this morning?

31:39.999 --> 31:42.833
What it would've been like
if I'd have stuck around,

31:42.835 --> 31:45.035
Seen him grow up.

31:45.037 --> 31:47.404
Seen him put on
his little Halloween outfit.

31:50.041 --> 31:52.109
What did he like dressing up as?

31:53.845 --> 31:58.015
He always wanted
to be the same thing.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.583
He wanted to be a soldier.

32:25.877 --> 32:27.577
Boo!
(gasps)

32:27.579 --> 32:28.879
(laughs)

32:28.881 --> 32:31.481
You!

32:34.552 --> 32:36.620
(woman humming)

33:01.746 --> 33:03.814
(humming continues)

33:20.098 --> 33:22.165
(humming)

33:30.775 --> 33:32.943
You don't scare me.

33:32.945 --> 33:34.978
I raised you
since you were this high.

33:34.980 --> 33:39.449
I found those poor animals
you killed behind the house.

33:39.451 --> 33:42.285
I told your mother all about it.

33:42.287 --> 33:46.790
If it happens again,
I'm calling the police.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.291
Do you hear me?

33:48.293 --> 33:50.127
Now, tell me
the truth.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.863
Did you have anything to do
with that mess in town?

33:54.132 --> 33:56.967
Oh, you gonna kill me?

33:56.969 --> 33:58.635
Go on, do it.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.670
(growling)

34:00.672 --> 34:02.973
Just like I thought.

34:02.975 --> 34:04.975
You couldn't have possibly
killed those people.

34:04.977 --> 34:07.377
You don't have the guts.

34:08.513 --> 34:11.181
Shut your piehole, dora!

34:11.183 --> 34:13.150
Or I <i>will</i> kill you!

34:13.152 --> 34:14.818
Oh, really?
Then kill me.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.520
Go on!

34:16.522 --> 34:18.054
I dare you!

34:27.364 --> 34:30.667
I hate you, dora.

34:30.668 --> 34:32.735
I hate you, I hate you,
I hate you!

34:36.007 --> 34:39.576
Believe me, boy,
I hate you, too.

34:50.221 --> 34:52.522
(phone ringing)
hello?

34:52.524 --> 34:54.391
I got to cut out.
I can't do this.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.693
Stanley:
Hey. Calm down.

34:56.695 --> 34:58.562
Did you do what I told you?

34:58.564 --> 34:59.863
Yes. I'm in.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.965
Okay. Well, what's wrong?

35:01.967 --> 35:04.034
(sighs)

35:04.036 --> 35:05.535
The freaks.

35:05.537 --> 35:06.870
They're everywhere.

35:06.872 --> 35:08.738
Pinheads. Stump girl.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.207
Seal man.

35:10.209 --> 35:13.043
Even when I close my eyes,
I still see them.

35:13.045 --> 35:14.711
They give me
the heebie-jeebies.

35:14.713 --> 35:18.215
<i>You won't believe</i>
<i>what I ran into today.</i>

35:18.217 --> 35:19.116
Excuse me.

35:21.052 --> 35:23.887
I thought customers weren't
allowed back here.

35:23.889 --> 35:26.056
Well, they're not.
She's one of us.

35:26.058 --> 35:27.390
Bette, dot,

35:27.392 --> 35:29.059
Meet esmeralda,

35:29.061 --> 35:31.394
Our new spiritualist.

35:31.396 --> 35:33.063
Come by my tent anytime.

35:33.065 --> 35:34.731
I'll give you
a free reading.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.566
I'm sure that's
not the only thing

35:36.568 --> 35:38.668
You give away for free.

35:44.575 --> 35:45.909
Come on.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.244
Stanley:
<i>Conjoined twins?</i>

35:47.246 --> 35:50.647
We hit the jackpot!

35:52.583 --> 35:53.917
Where are they attached?

35:53.919 --> 35:55.619
Do they have
four limbs or eight?

35:55.621 --> 35:56.920
What's the difference?

35:56.922 --> 35:58.088
The size of the jar

35:58.090 --> 36:00.657
I have to get.

36:04.595 --> 36:06.263
You never said
anything about murder.

36:06.265 --> 36:08.265
I'm not spending the rest
of my life in jail.

36:08.267 --> 36:11.101
Nobody cares
what happens to a freak.

36:11.103 --> 36:14.271
The only proper question is
how we display the body:

36:14.273 --> 36:15.939
Under formaldehyde
or vacuum-sealed?

36:15.941 --> 36:17.607
Trust me, you do
what I tell you,

36:17.609 --> 36:19.109
We are gonna break the bank
on this one.

36:19.111 --> 36:21.278
I'll be there, but...

36:21.280 --> 36:23.780
After I take care
of my business.

36:23.782 --> 36:26.183
Maggie:
Shit on a stick, I got to go.

36:30.488 --> 36:33.356
(siren wailing)

36:45.336 --> 36:47.804
There's a curfew out tonight,

36:47.806 --> 36:50.240
Starting at 8:00.

36:52.677 --> 36:55.312
Still got a good
ten minutes, bub.

36:55.314 --> 36:57.647
One tick over, I'm hauling
you two right to jail.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.149
Oh...

36:59.151 --> 37:01.151
I'm sorry, officer.

37:01.153 --> 37:03.153
I had to call my grandmother.

37:03.155 --> 37:04.487
She has been awful sick lately.

37:04.489 --> 37:06.723
I promise we'll
head home right away.

37:08.993 --> 37:10.994
Look, you look like a nice,

37:10.996 --> 37:12.662
Christian girl.
Take my advice.

37:12.664 --> 37:16.066
Stop hanging around
with troublemakers.

37:17.501 --> 37:21.004
Why are we getting rousted?

37:21.006 --> 37:22.339
'cause of meep?

37:22.341 --> 37:24.507
Or what you cops
did to him?

37:24.509 --> 37:26.176
Keep talking,
motormouth.

37:26.178 --> 37:29.246
My watch is running fast.

37:31.215 --> 37:32.349
Cool it.

37:32.351 --> 37:34.417
We're going now.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.722
Right, jimmy?

37:38.724 --> 37:41.024
(engine revs)

37:41.026 --> 37:43.360
Yeah, let's blow.

37:43.362 --> 37:46.096
Place smells like
pig shit, anyway.

37:48.699 --> 37:51.201
Stanley:
<i>You know...</i>

37:51.203 --> 37:52.569
(exhales)

37:52.571 --> 37:54.871
...I've never done it
with a viking god before.

37:54.873 --> 37:58.208
But, uh... Aren't you
missing something, thor?

37:58.210 --> 38:00.410
What, a hammer?

38:00.412 --> 38:02.812
(chuckles)

38:04.215 --> 38:06.783
A sword.

38:15.059 --> 38:17.294
Come here. Now...

38:19.597 --> 38:23.233
...Take off

38:23.235 --> 38:27.003
My pants.

38:38.416 --> 38:41.251
Holy christ.

38:41.253 --> 38:42.485
(chuckles)

38:52.096 --> 38:55.165
¶

39:00.771 --> 39:02.439
I can't wait for
Halloween to be over.

39:02.441 --> 39:04.774
All the kids
jacked up on sugar.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.444
I'd rather that than
have them watch tv.

39:07.446 --> 39:10.613
I swear,
dragnet is going to be

39:10.615 --> 39:12.449
The downfall
of american culture.

39:12.451 --> 39:14.384
(laughs)

39:18.289 --> 39:20.357
(footsteps)

39:33.971 --> 39:35.138
(gasps)

39:35.140 --> 39:37.974
Hey, give it back!

39:37.976 --> 39:41.311
I might give you
some of <i>my</i> candy

39:41.313 --> 39:44.013
If you promise to do
my chores for a week.

39:44.015 --> 39:45.315
(quiet breathing)

39:45.317 --> 39:49.152
And you call me master mike
from now on.

39:49.154 --> 39:50.820
Say it.

39:50.822 --> 39:54.324
"master mike,
I promise to do

39:54.326 --> 39:56.593
All your chores for a week."

40:00.831 --> 40:03.733
What's the matter with you?

40:06.504 --> 40:09.339
(screaming)

40:09.341 --> 40:11.741
(clattering)

40:13.010 --> 40:14.677
What happened?

40:14.679 --> 40:15.712
Where's your brother?

40:15.714 --> 40:18.415
The clown took him.

40:33.898 --> 40:35.532
You don't come in
until here, stupid.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.534
Well, I can't do anything right

40:37.536 --> 40:39.602
When you talk to me so mean.

40:41.205 --> 40:42.872
Dot:
You're twenty minutes late.

40:42.874 --> 40:44.541
We've decided
it's a bad idea.

40:44.543 --> 40:47.544
You never know what could
summon mr. Mordrake.

40:47.546 --> 40:50.713
Even a rehearsal
is risky business.

40:50.715 --> 40:53.383
Dot: You carnies are
so superstitious.

40:53.385 --> 40:55.051
He's a myth.

40:55.053 --> 40:56.953
I am the only myth around here.

40:58.389 --> 41:00.223
They're not concerned
about mordrake.

41:00.225 --> 41:01.891
I'm trying to tell...
Of course they're not.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.426
Simply a superstition.

41:03.428 --> 41:04.961
You two run along, now.

41:06.397 --> 41:09.232
A clairvoyant has sworn to me

41:09.234 --> 41:12.902
That a very important gentleman
will be arriving very soon

41:12.904 --> 41:15.572
To reinvigorate my career.

41:15.574 --> 41:18.408
So I must rehearse
some new material.

41:18.410 --> 41:20.410
Dot: Well, you can rehearse
when we're done.

41:20.412 --> 41:23.079
We're the headliners.

41:23.081 --> 41:26.583
A bit of applause

41:26.585 --> 41:29.586
For a two-headed girl
who sings a song,

41:29.588 --> 41:32.255
And you think
you can push me out?

41:32.257 --> 41:35.425
We should probably
discuss our salary,

41:35.427 --> 41:38.428
Since we are now
the star attraction.

41:38.430 --> 41:39.762
How dare you?

41:39.764 --> 41:42.432
I have been a star
for decades now!

41:42.434 --> 41:44.100
You are nothing...

41:44.102 --> 41:46.603
Nothing but a two-headed freak

41:46.605 --> 41:50.273
Stumbling around the
stage, squeaking out

41:50.275 --> 41:52.675
A crummy tune.

41:54.612 --> 41:58.781
Go back to your tent
and stay there,

41:58.783 --> 42:01.150
Or I will take you
into the swamp

42:01.152 --> 42:03.686
And leave you there.

42:22.640 --> 42:24.474
What are you staring at? Hmm?

42:24.476 --> 42:27.377
Do you value your jobs
around here?!

42:29.980 --> 42:32.649
Then walk those long legs
up to the piano. And you...

42:32.651 --> 42:34.918
Pick up those drumsticks
and start banging.

42:36.654 --> 42:38.221
Schnell!

42:41.492 --> 42:43.560
¶

42:50.501 --> 42:54.671
¶ in the land
of gods and monsters ¶

42:54.673 --> 42:58.341
¶ I was an angel

42:58.343 --> 43:01.844
¶ living in the garden of evil

43:01.846 --> 43:04.047
¶ screwed up, scared

43:04.049 --> 43:06.616
¶ doing anything that I needed

43:08.218 --> 43:11.688
¶ shining like a fiery beacon

43:11.690 --> 43:17.193
¶ you got that medicine I need

43:17.195 --> 43:19.028
¶ fame, liquor, love

43:19.030 --> 43:21.698
¶ give it to me slowly

43:21.700 --> 43:24.534
¶ put your hands on my waist

43:24.536 --> 43:26.569
¶ do it softly

43:26.571 --> 43:29.872
¶ me and god,
we don't get along ¶

43:29.874 --> 43:32.742
¶ so now I sing

43:32.744 --> 43:37.547
¶ no one's gonna
take my soul away ¶

43:37.549 --> 43:42.552
¶ I'm living like jim morrison

43:42.554 --> 43:47.223
¶ headed towards
a messed-up holiday ¶

43:47.225 --> 43:51.894
¶ motel sprees,
sprees and I'm singing ¶

43:51.896 --> 43:54.564
¶ oh, yeah, give it to me

43:54.566 --> 43:59.235
¶ this is heaven,
what I truly want ¶

43:59.237 --> 44:02.572
¶ it's innocence lost

44:05.275 --> 44:08.645
¶ innocence lost

44:13.250 --> 44:15.585
¶ when you talk,
it's like a movie ¶

44:15.587 --> 44:19.589
¶ and you're making me crazy

44:19.591 --> 44:22.759
¶ 'cause life imitates art

44:22.761 --> 44:25.595
¶ if I get a little prettier

44:25.597 --> 44:28.598
¶ can I be your baby?

44:28.600 --> 44:33.136
¶ you tell me life isn't
that hard ¶

44:33.138 --> 44:37.774
¶ no one's gonna
take my soul away ¶

44:37.776 --> 44:43.613
¶ I'm living like jim morrison

44:43.615 --> 44:48.618
¶ headed towards
a messed-up holiday ¶

44:48.620 --> 44:52.321
¶ motel, sprees, sprees
and I'm singing ¶

44:52.323 --> 44:54.123
¶ oh, yeah, give it to me

44:54.125 --> 44:59.028
¶ this is heaven,
what I truly want ¶

44:59.963 --> 45:03.366
¶ it's innocence lost

45:05.469 --> 45:08.705
¶ innocence lost.

45:11.341 --> 45:12.341
(music ends)

45:12.343 --> 45:15.211
(indistinct whispering)

45:44.208 --> 45:46.275
¶

46:15.205 --> 46:16.939
(huffs)

46:41.899 --> 46:44.634
(indistinct whispering)

46:51.742 --> 46:54.744
My companions startled you.

46:54.746 --> 46:56.279
My sincerest apologies.

46:56.281 --> 46:58.781
A good all hallow's eve

46:58.783 --> 47:01.250
To you, madam.

47:01.252 --> 47:04.086
Edward mordrake.

47:04.088 --> 47:07.423
At your service.

47:07.425 --> 47:10.593
Well... I didn't summon you.

47:10.595 --> 47:12.428
It matters not
who summoned us.

47:12.430 --> 47:14.931
Only that we have
been summoned.

47:14.933 --> 47:17.767
And now, sadly, we are here

47:17.769 --> 47:20.303
And cannot leave this place
until we have added

47:20.305 --> 47:23.773
To our coterie
of freakish companions.

47:23.775 --> 47:25.775
You say "companions."

47:25.777 --> 47:27.944
You-you mean "victims."

47:27.946 --> 47:30.613
It is not in my heart
to make you

47:30.615 --> 47:33.449
Or anyone else a victim,
my good woman.

47:33.451 --> 47:35.952
But the visage
is unrelenting.

47:35.954 --> 47:38.621
I am its slave.
(indistinct whispering)

47:38.623 --> 47:40.957
Silence! We have intruded
upon this lady uninvited.

47:40.959 --> 47:44.160
Show some courtesy.

47:44.162 --> 47:46.295
You can't take me with you.

47:46.297 --> 47:49.131
There's so much
I have left to do.

47:49.133 --> 47:51.801
And my time is short as it is.

47:51.803 --> 47:54.804
Would that it were in my
power to grant reprieve.

47:54.806 --> 47:58.474
But if the vile countenance
a-judges you a pure freak--

47:58.476 --> 48:00.810
Corrupted of flesh,
befouled of soul--

48:00.812 --> 48:02.645
There can be no petition.

48:02.647 --> 48:03.980
Yes! You are vile!

48:03.982 --> 48:05.047
Vile and malevolent!

48:08.652 --> 48:10.820
I am sorry.

48:10.822 --> 48:14.991
There are questions
which must be asked.

48:14.993 --> 48:17.326
As indelicate as they may be.

48:17.328 --> 48:19.996
And you must be candid.

48:19.998 --> 48:22.164
If you lie...

48:22.166 --> 48:24.901
It will know.

48:55.065 --> 48:57.133
(indistinct whispering)

48:59.870 --> 49:01.871
You were not always in such

49:01.873 --> 49:03.873
A degraded
state as this.

49:03.875 --> 49:06.242
You have fallen.

49:06.244 --> 49:07.877
Yeah.

49:07.879 --> 49:09.879
The story of your fall.

49:09.881 --> 49:12.782
It would hear it
from your own mouth.

49:16.053 --> 49:17.887
It's true.

49:17.889 --> 49:20.556
I have fallen.

49:20.558 --> 49:22.391
More than once.

49:22.393 --> 49:24.961
And this backwater
ain't the worst of it.

49:28.265 --> 49:31.233
I had an act once.

49:31.235 --> 49:33.736
Slick as anything in vaudeville.

49:33.738 --> 49:35.438
¶
<i>I'd surround myself</i>

49:35.440 --> 49:38.908
<i>With the prettiest girls</i>
<i>I could find.</i>

49:38.910 --> 49:44.113
<i>And then I'd dare the audience</i>
<i>to look at anything but me.</i>

49:44.115 --> 49:48.084
<i>And they loved me for it.</i>

49:48.086 --> 49:50.286
<i>I was the biggest thing</i>
<i>to come out of baltimore</i>

49:50.288 --> 49:52.121
<i>Since wallis simpson.</i>

49:52.123 --> 49:56.292
<i>Now, she landed</i>
<i>herself a monarch.</i>

49:56.294 --> 49:59.996
<i>I ended up</i>
<i>with something else-- dell.</i>

50:01.598 --> 50:05.101
I think maybe he really...

50:05.103 --> 50:08.104
He really did love me at first.

50:08.106 --> 50:09.772
I know I was crazy

50:09.774 --> 50:12.274
About him.

50:12.276 --> 50:15.111
He became my manager.

50:15.113 --> 50:18.114
Put all kinds of ideas
in my head.

50:18.116 --> 50:20.783
Told me I shouldn't be
doing popular tunes

50:20.785 --> 50:22.618
And playing for laughs.

50:22.620 --> 50:24.954
He said rich folks
don't pay for low comedy.

50:24.956 --> 50:28.157
They want culture and art.

50:28.159 --> 50:30.493
He convinced me
to leave the three-ring

50:30.495 --> 50:32.628
When the show went to paris.

50:32.630 --> 50:37.166
He'd manage me exclusive
and we'd make a million.

50:37.168 --> 50:39.035
Me as the bearded bernhardt.

50:40.971 --> 50:43.305
(crowd booing)
romeo, romeo!

50:43.307 --> 50:45.808
Wherefore art thou, romeo?

50:45.810 --> 50:49.145
Deny thy father
and refuse thy name...

50:49.147 --> 50:51.147
(booing continues)

50:51.149 --> 50:53.983
But if thou wilt not...

50:53.985 --> 50:56.152
Be but sworn my love.

50:56.154 --> 50:58.521
<i>Well, nobody wanted</i>
<i>to see some hairy broad</i>

50:58.523 --> 50:59.989
<i>Reciting the classics.</i>

50:59.991 --> 51:01.357
<i>They laughed all right.</i>

51:01.359 --> 51:03.993
<i>This time I wasn't</i>
<i>in on the joke.</i>

51:03.995 --> 51:05.528
<i>I was the joke.</i>

51:05.530 --> 51:07.897
How dreadful for you.

51:09.032 --> 51:11.400
(indistinct whispering)

51:13.170 --> 51:15.704
What's it saying?

51:15.706 --> 51:20.176
It knows you have a deeper pain.

51:20.178 --> 51:22.244
A darker shame?

51:26.683 --> 51:29.018
Yes.

51:29.020 --> 51:32.855
When you returned
to the states,

51:32.857 --> 51:35.925
What happened?

51:39.696 --> 51:42.264
We were penniless.

51:46.036 --> 51:48.437
I was carrying dell's child.

51:50.874 --> 51:54.376
We couldn't find carny work.

51:54.378 --> 51:58.114
And I couldn't do my act--
not in that condition.

52:02.719 --> 52:05.788
So, dell arranged...

52:08.558 --> 52:11.260
...A different kind
of command performance.

52:11.262 --> 52:13.262
Dell: <i>Grab some peanuts</i>
<i>on your way in, sir.</i>

52:13.264 --> 52:15.064
Thank you so much.

52:15.066 --> 52:16.232
Step right up, folks.

52:16.234 --> 52:18.067
It's the marvel of the century.

52:18.069 --> 52:19.768
A live freak birth.

52:19.770 --> 52:22.071
Something like you've
never seen before.

52:22.073 --> 52:24.907
Right before your very eyes,
a live freak birth.

52:24.909 --> 52:26.075
Right this way, sir!

52:26.077 --> 52:28.777
Right before
your very eyes, folks!

52:28.779 --> 52:31.347
(screaming)

52:37.921 --> 52:39.989
(baby crying)

52:41.925 --> 52:45.261
Woman: Look at his hands!
It's a monster! (gasps)

52:45.263 --> 52:47.463
It's two bits to hold
the monster baby!

52:47.465 --> 52:49.932
Two bits! Would you
like to hold him, sir?

52:49.934 --> 52:51.467
Two bits!

52:51.469 --> 52:52.935
You, ma'am!
Hold the monster baby!

52:52.937 --> 52:54.103
It's a freak!

52:54.105 --> 52:57.339
(crying):
My poor boy.

52:59.776 --> 53:02.845
How could I have
done that to him?

53:06.283 --> 53:09.952
He's never known anything
but exploitation

53:09.954 --> 53:13.122
Right from the start.

53:13.124 --> 53:15.357
I cursed my own child.

53:40.984 --> 53:44.987
Thank you for your pains,
dear lady.

53:44.989 --> 53:47.156
I'm sorry you had to relive

53:47.158 --> 53:49.658
Any of this.

53:49.660 --> 53:52.161
I relive it every day.

53:52.163 --> 53:54.730
(indistinct whispering)

54:01.871 --> 54:03.939
(sniffles)

54:06.009 --> 54:08.244
I'm ready.

54:10.380 --> 54:12.348
Take me to hell with you.

54:12.350 --> 54:15.417
I deserve it.

54:17.187 --> 54:19.788
(demonic whisper):
Not the one.

54:44.381 --> 54:46.815
(footsteps approaching)

54:49.052 --> 54:52.388
Man:
¶ trick or treat?

54:52.390 --> 54:56.225
¶ trick or treat,
trick or treat? ¶

54:56.227 --> 55:00.462
¶ find me something
good to eat ¶

55:05.402 --> 55:09.238
¶ trick or treat,
trick or treat? ¶

55:09.240 --> 55:12.241
Trick or treat?

55:12.243 --> 55:16.245
Trick or treat,
trick or treat, trick or treat?

55:16.247 --> 55:18.580
(gasps)
trick or treat?

55:18.582 --> 55:21.950
Trick or treat,
trick or treat?

55:21.952 --> 55:24.486
Trick or treat?

55:25.755 --> 55:27.089
Trick!

55:27.091 --> 55:28.324
(gasping)

55:33.596 --> 55:36.498
Too short.

55:38.101 --> 55:39.501
Not for long.

55:46.276 --> 55:48.344
Eureka!

55:53.450 --> 55:55.184
That'll do.

55:59.322 --> 56:00.322
(gasps)

56:00.324 --> 56:02.524
(footsteps approaching)

56:09.299 --> 56:11.900
(crying)

56:18.007 --> 56:20.075
More fun.
