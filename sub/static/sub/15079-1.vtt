THAT MY HAND WAS SHAKING.

IT WAS A TREMOR,
A SIDE EFFECT OF MY MEDICATION.

30:09.278 --> 30:10.379

WHEN I WENT TO GET HER THINGS,
I FOUND THE GUN.

37:28.647 --> 37:30.649
I-I THOUGHT, "HOW POETIC."

37:30.649 --> 37:33.021
YOU KNOW,
KILL HIM WITH HIS OWN GUN.

37:33.021 --> 37:35.284
BUT THEN FLYNN
WAS SENTENCED TO DEATH.

37:35.284 --> 37:37.456
I PUT THE GUN AWAY,
AND I FORGOT ABOUT IT.

37:37.456 --> 37:40.258
UNTIL THAT SHYSTER,
RUBEN BAUER, SHOWED UP

37:40.258 --> 37:41.690
AND GOT HIM A NEW TRIAL.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.662
I DID GO TO SEE BILLY
TO TELL HIM

37:43.662 --> 37:46.795
HOW HE WASN'T GONNA GET AWAY
WITH IT THIS TIME, EITHER.

37:46.795 --> 37:49.538
HOW WHEN THEY FINALLY FRIED HIM,
I WOULD BE RIGHT THERE

37:49.538 --> 37:50.839
TO ENJOY WATCHING THE LIFE
DRAIN OUT HIM.

37:50.839 --> 37:55.304
HE JUST KEPT SAYING
HOW SORRY HE WAS,

37:55.304 --> 37:57.846
LIKE THAT WAS GONNA
CHANGE MY MIND.

37:57.846 --> 38:00.709
THEN YOU SHOWED UP
AND TESTIFIED

38:00.709 --> 38:03.352
HOW BILLY HAD MIRACULOUSLY
TURNED INTO THIS SAINT.

38:03.352 --> 38:05.884
YOU KNOW,
IT MADE ME WANT TO PUKE.

38:05.884 --> 38:08.557
BUT I COULD SEE HOW THE JURY
WAS BUYING ALL THE CRAP

38:08.557 --> 38:10.359
YOU AND THAT LAWYER
WERE SLINGING.

38:10.359 --> 38:12.891
AND YOU REALIZED
HE MIGHT ACTUALLY GET OFF.

38:12.891 --> 38:15.364
MAYBE THE JURY WOULD SPARE
HIS PATHETIC EXCUSE OF A LIFE,

38:15.364 --> 38:16.625
AND THAT WAS A CHANCE
I COULDN'T TAKE.

38:16.625 --> 38:17.966
SO YOU WENT
TO THE DEFENSE

38:17.966 --> 38:19.728
AND OFFERED TO TESTIFY
ON FLYNN'S BEHALF.

38:19.728 --> 38:22.000
YOU FIGURED IF THE VICTIM'S
OWN BROTHER TESTIFIED

38:22.000 --> 38:23.902
THAT FLYNN HAD CHANGED,
THEN...
HE'D GET OUT,

38:23.902 --> 38:27.005
AND I'D MAKE SURE HE GOT
THE JUSTICE THAT HE DESERVED.

38:36.885 --> 38:40.749
YOU THINK BILLY BECAME
A DIFFERENT PERSON, DR. PIERCE?

38:40.749 --> 38:45.093
WHEN HE KILLED MY SISTER,
I BECAME A DIFFERENT PERSON.

38:53.331 --> 38:57.836
CHARLIE KENDRICKS
IS REFUSING A PLEA.

38:57.836 --> 39:00.709
SAYS HE WANTS A TRIAL.

39:00.709 --> 39:05.974
SO BILLY GETS OUT,
AND CHARLIE GOES IN.

39:05.974 --> 39:08.447
WELL, MAYBE NOT.

39:08.447 --> 39:09.748
WHAT?
YOU THINK HE'LL WALK?

39:09.748 --> 39:12.381
RUBEN BAUER JUST AGREED
TO REPRESENT HIM.

39:12.381 --> 39:14.352
[ LAUGHS ]
I WONDER IF HE'LL PUT UP

39:14.352 --> 39:16.955
THAT "HE'S A DIFFERENT GUY
ALTOGETHER" DEFENSE AGAIN.

39:19.988 --> 39:23.462
I WONDER IF I COULD EVER BE
A DIFFERENT GUY ALTOGETHER.

39:25.093 --> 39:27.436
DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE
YOU HATE SO MUCH.

39:27.436 --> 39:28.567
MAYBE.

39:29.938 --> 39:32.441
IF I SHOT YOU
IN THE HEAD.

39:32.441 --> 39:34.503
[ CHUCKLES ]

39:34.503 --> 39:36.575
DANIEL! DANIEL.

39:36.575 --> 39:38.577
YOU OWE ME BIG TIME.

39:38.577 --> 39:39.778
WHAT FOR?

39:39.778 --> 39:41.079
BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T BE
MY WINGMAN,

39:41.079 --> 39:42.711
I HAD TO INVITE
NEUMEIER FROM ENGINEERING.

39:42.711 --> 39:43.982
TOTAL DISASTER.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.554
THE MAN'S IRRITABLE BOWEL
WAS ACTING UP.

39:45.554 --> 39:47.486
HE GOT UP THREE TIMES
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,

39:47.486 --> 39:48.857
FOR GOODNESS' SAKES.

39:48.857 --> 39:49.988
NEEDLESS TO SAY,
THE WHOLE EVENING WAS RUINED,

39:49.988 --> 39:51.389
AND NOW ELAINE IS SAYING

39:51.389 --> 39:52.661
SHE JUST DOESN'T THINK OF ME
IN THAT WAY.

39:52.661 --> 39:53.562
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO
ABOUT IT?

39:53.562 --> 39:55.093
THIS WOMAN YOU'RE DATING.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.565
SURELY SHE'S GOT FRIENDS,
RIGHT?

39:56.565 --> 39:58.567
SMART, FUNNY,
SEXY FRIENDS?

39:58.567 --> 40:01.029
I'M ASKING YOU
TO SET ME UP.

40:01.029 --> 40:03.672
Caroline: SO,
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

40:03.672 --> 40:06.074
I TOLD HIM FORGET IT.
I'M NOT A DATING SERVICE.

40:06.074 --> 40:08.076
AND DID YOU TELL HIM
WHO YOU WERE DATING?

40:08.076 --> 40:09.478
ARE YOU KIDDING?

40:09.478 --> 40:10.839
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A GOSSIP
HALEY CAN BE?

40:10.839 --> 40:12.711
Woman: DANIEL,
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

40:14.112 --> 40:15.844
MYSELF.

40:19.618 --> 40:23.121
I KNOW HOW PICKY YOU CAN BE
ABOUT YOUR TEA.

40:23.121 --> 40:24.593
I HOPE I GOT YOU
THE RIGHT KIND.

40:24.593 --> 40:26.455
I'M NOT THAT PICKY.
I LIKE A LOT OF TEA.

40:26.455 --> 40:28.126
WELL...
YOU'RE A LITTLE PICKY.

40:28.126 --> 40:29.498
MAYBE
I'M A LITTLE PICKY.

40:29.498 --> 40:31.960
Daniel:
CAN PEOPLE REALLY CHANGE?

40:31.960 --> 40:35.804
IS OUR PERSONALITY
GENETICALLY PRE-PROGRAMMED,

40:35.804 --> 40:37.906
OR IS IT MALLEABLE?

40:37.906 --> 40:42.911
THE SCIENCE OF NEUROPLASTICITY
SUGGESTS THAT OUR BRAIN

40:42.911 --> 40:46.014
HAS THE ABILITY TO CHANGE
AND GROW THROUGHOUT OUR LIFE.

40:46.014 --> 40:50.178
IN ESSENCE,
OUR EXPERIENCES REWIRE US.

40:53.582 --> 40:54.983
THEY CAN MAKE US DO
OR THINK THINGS

40:54.983 --> 40:57.786
PREVIOUSLY UNDOABLE
OR UNTHINKABLE.

40:57.786 --> 41:02.761
THEY CAN PROVOKE US INTO FORMING
NEW THOUGHTS AND IDEAS.

41:02.761 --> 41:05.634
AND THEY CAN TEACH US
VALUABLE LESSONS,

41:05.634 --> 41:09.668
MAKING US LESS INCLINED TO
REPEAT THE MISTAKES OF OUR PAST.

41:12.841 --> 41:16.845
THE BRAIN IS
IN A CONSTANT STATE OF FLUX,

41:16.845 --> 41:19.908
SUGGESTING THAT NOTHING IN LIFE
IS PERMANENT.

41:25.654 --> 41:27.786
AND YET, AS THEY SAY,

41:27.786 --> 41:34.222
THE MORE THAT THINGS CHANGE,
THE MORE THEY STAY THE SAME.
