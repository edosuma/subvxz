00:00.133 --> 00:01.750
Previously on "Switched at Birth"...

00:02.013 --> 00:03.475
Doesn't it bother you that these guys

00:03.477 --> 00:04.745
who are supposed to be your friends

00:04.780 --> 00:05.880
didn't stand up for you?

00:05.914 --> 00:07.314
Why're you always dumping on my fraternity?

00:07.398 --> 00:10.701
This is buy-out agreement for a business

00:10.736 --> 00:12.003
we're tearing down in East Riverside

00:12.037 --> 00:13.303
to make room for our project.

00:13.338 --> 00:14.304
He asked me what I thought.

00:14.339 --> 00:16.106
And I said it was a good deal.

00:16.140 --> 00:17.841
It is. For your boss.

00:17.875 --> 00:18.975
You took what I said in confidence

00:19.010 --> 00:20.677
and you used it against me.

00:20.711 --> 00:21.378
You're fired.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.181
Oh my God.

00:26.017 --> 00:28.218
- _
- You've never even met Mandy.

00:28.219 --> 00:32.460
_

00:32.479 --> 00:34.447
There's something off here, Emmett.

00:34.448 --> 00:37.352
_

00:41.640 --> 00:43.164
_

00:50.329 --> 00:51.796
I love you.

00:51.831 --> 00:53.465
I never stopped.

01:03.909 --> 01:05.141
Hey.

01:05.177 --> 01:06.878
What's going on?

01:06.879 --> 01:09.693
_

01:09.969 --> 01:11.268
- What?!
- Shh.

01:13.432 --> 01:16.734
What about Tank and Mandy?

01:16.769 --> 01:19.336
Okay, pause on the whole Tank thing.

01:19.371 --> 01:21.773
But there is no Mandy.

01:21.807 --> 01:22.506
It was actually Matthew.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.743
Pretending to be a girl?

01:25.778 --> 01:27.679
Yeah!

01:27.713 --> 01:28.980
I'm late for curfew,

01:29.014 --> 01:31.347
so I will tell you everything tomorrow.

01:31.382 --> 01:32.649
- Tomorrow?!
- I know.

01:32.684 --> 01:34.585
But, just, um...

01:34.619 --> 01:37.087
The thing is, um,

01:37.121 --> 01:39.322
Emmett and I,

01:39.356 --> 01:41.058
uh...

01:41.092 --> 01:42.125
we didn't...

01:45.329 --> 01:47.725
_

01:48.335 --> 01:49.332
Bay.

01:49.366 --> 01:51.001
I know, I know.

01:51.035 --> 01:52.368
That's idiotic

01:52.403 --> 01:54.471
of both of you.

01:54.505 --> 01:55.973
No argument here.

01:56.007 --> 01:58.408
I was kind of hoping that
you would come with me

01:58.442 --> 02:00.276
to get the thing that you take

02:00.311 --> 02:02.979
the morning after you're a complete idiot.

02:03.013 --> 02:04.614
The morning after pill.

02:07.418 --> 02:08.485
Of course.

02:08.519 --> 02:09.752
I thought I heard you two.

02:11.989 --> 02:13.022
- Hi!
- Hey.

02:13.056 --> 02:14.157
- Everything okay?
- Oh, totally.

02:15.659 --> 02:18.761
- I'm going to bed.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:18.795 --> 02:19.629
Uh, me too.

02:21.024 --> 02:23.926
We'll see you in the morning?

02:23.961 --> 02:24.894
Absolutely.

02:24.928 --> 02:26.096
- Okay, good night, sweetie.
- Good night.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.720
- _
- _

03:47.174 --> 03:49.142
There's nothing to worry about.

03:49.176 --> 03:53.146
It was a brick through your
window with a threat on it.

03:53.180 --> 03:55.148
I'm not working for Wes anymore.

03:55.182 --> 03:56.415
Oh, good, what are you gonna do?

03:56.449 --> 03:58.651
Pass out flyers telling people that?

03:58.686 --> 04:00.252
Found 'em.

04:00.287 --> 04:03.656
I just can't believe that
someone would do that to you.

04:03.691 --> 04:04.991
These people are our friends.

04:05.025 --> 04:06.659
It's not the whole neighborhood.

04:06.693 --> 04:07.826
It's one person.

04:07.860 --> 04:09.428
Well, don't you want to find out who?

04:09.462 --> 04:11.830
No, we leave it alone.

04:11.864 --> 04:14.833
Sweetie, I know we have to tell

04:14.867 --> 04:15.967
John and Kathryn what happened.

04:17.504 --> 04:20.038
I'd like to do it.

04:20.072 --> 04:21.873
All right.

04:21.908 --> 04:25.244
And I'd rather we don't tell Angelo at all.

04:25.278 --> 04:26.945
You know how he can get.

04:26.979 --> 04:30.516
- Mom.
- I just don't want anyone to overreact.

04:30.550 --> 04:31.617
It's not gonna help anything.

04:31.651 --> 04:33.385
Okay.

04:33.420 --> 04:34.986
Thanks.

04:38.290 --> 04:41.026
Oh, who knew Iceland could be so awesome?

04:41.060 --> 04:44.329
And yet not that icy.

04:44.363 --> 04:46.464
Apparently, 50% of the
people living in Iceland

04:46.498 --> 04:48.333
- believe in invisible elves.
- Well, good.

04:48.367 --> 04:51.131
Maybe Toby can find himself
a little invisible elf girl

04:51.132 --> 04:53.038
- and settle down.
- Too soon.

04:53.072 --> 04:55.573
So how'd it go last night?

04:55.608 --> 04:57.275
How did what go?

04:57.309 --> 04:59.277
Your math study group.

04:59.311 --> 05:00.811
Oh, that. Yeah, it was good.

05:00.846 --> 05:02.813
Uh, but confusing, so it was good...

05:02.848 --> 05:04.315
- But confusing.
- Hey.

05:04.350 --> 05:07.985
Ah, yes, we should go.

05:08.019 --> 05:09.554
- So soon?
- Uh, yeah.

05:09.588 --> 05:10.722
I have to pick up something before school.

05:10.756 --> 05:13.324
- Where?
- The drugstore for zit cream.

05:13.359 --> 05:15.159
- We got to go.
- Hi.

05:15.193 --> 05:17.061
- Hi, bye.
- Bye.

05:17.095 --> 05:18.963
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:18.997 --> 05:20.898
I wanted to let you guys know

05:20.932 --> 05:23.968
that we had some vandalism
at the store yesterday.

05:24.002 --> 05:25.702
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh, that's terrible.

05:25.737 --> 05:27.071
Someone broke a window.
Probably some stupid kid.

05:27.105 --> 05:28.873
Have there been other problems in the area

05:28.907 --> 05:30.040
with other businesses?

05:30.075 --> 05:31.809
I really don't know.

05:31.843 --> 05:32.777
Let me tell you something.

05:32.811 --> 05:35.045
I have had my own
experiences with vandalism.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.546
It is so frustrating.

05:36.581 --> 05:38.582
These people, they have
nothing better to do

05:38.616 --> 05:40.450
than run around destroying property.

05:40.485 --> 05:42.085
I just wanted to let you know

05:42.119 --> 05:44.321
in case you came by and saw it boarded up.

05:44.355 --> 05:45.555
I didn't want you to worry.

05:45.590 --> 05:46.757
It's getting taken care of today.

05:46.791 --> 05:49.459
Anything I can do to
help, just let me know.

05:49.494 --> 05:50.927
Thanks, but I got it.

05:50.961 --> 05:52.429
Oh, tomorrow... what
do you want for dinner?

05:52.463 --> 05:55.165
I can do that mushroom
risotto you like or...

05:55.199 --> 05:57.000
I could make a pasta
with basil and tomatoes.

05:57.034 --> 05:59.536
Really, I don't want
you to go to any trouble.

05:59.570 --> 06:01.638
It's your birthday. We have to celebrate.

06:01.673 --> 06:03.173
I don't mind. Just pick one.

06:03.207 --> 06:05.241
I guess the risotto.

06:05.276 --> 06:06.509
Excellent choice.

06:06.543 --> 06:08.178
Okay.

06:08.212 --> 06:09.745
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.537
_

06:26.138 --> 06:28.170
_

06:30.071 --> 06:31.616
_

06:31.817 --> 06:33.150
_

06:36.551 --> 06:39.155
_

06:40.356 --> 06:45.103
_

06:46.384 --> 06:47.724
_

06:49.425 --> 06:51.543
_

06:53.084 --> 06:57.044
_

06:57.045 --> 07:00.807
_

07:02.208 --> 07:04.705
_

07:04.706 --> 07:06.413
_

07:06.414 --> 07:09.392
_

07:11.250 --> 07:15.407
_

07:15.408 --> 07:17.458
_

07:17.459 --> 07:18.676
_

07:19.177 --> 07:20.116
_

07:21.317 --> 07:25.061
_

07:25.113 --> 07:30.695
_

07:41.488 --> 07:42.722
Yikes.

07:44.826 --> 07:45.992
What are you doing here?

07:46.027 --> 07:48.361
Delivering a bill for my own broken window.

07:48.395 --> 07:51.031
A brick sailed through K&D last night.

07:51.065 --> 07:53.733
Are you okay?

07:53.767 --> 07:56.903
Yeah, my daughter was with me.

07:56.938 --> 07:59.172
- She was kinda shaken up.
- These people.

07:59.207 --> 08:01.874
You know, there are a dozen
places where I could put my money.

08:01.908 --> 08:03.343
I could sell the whole
block to some Megastore.

08:03.377 --> 08:05.511
- Are you gonna do that?
- Yeah, probably.

08:07.681 --> 08:09.382
That's a shame.

08:09.416 --> 08:11.016
I'll subtract this from what I owe you

08:11.051 --> 08:13.219
and come up with some sort of payment plan.

08:15.155 --> 08:16.021
Yeah, sure.

08:18.559 --> 08:19.726
Hey.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.761
If anything else happens,
you let me know, okay?

08:21.795 --> 08:23.962
Will do.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.046
Hey, Monica.

08:42.081 --> 08:44.382
- Hey.
- These are so good.

08:44.416 --> 08:45.583
I almost forgot.

08:45.617 --> 08:47.451
Can I get you one?

08:47.486 --> 08:48.353
No, I'm good.

08:49.521 --> 08:51.155
Sit down.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.795
Thanks for coming.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.864
I wanted to ask you something.

08:59.898 --> 09:02.800
Someone threw a brick into
my mom's store yesterday

09:02.834 --> 09:04.568
with a threat to stay
out of the neighborhood.

09:04.603 --> 09:07.004
Well, you can't be that surprised.

09:07.038 --> 09:09.239
She's just trying to help.

09:09.274 --> 09:10.040
She's not the enemy here.

09:10.074 --> 09:14.978
She sold out her friends for profit.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.046
Sounds like the enemy to me.

09:17.080 --> 09:19.749
What, do you think she's
gonna get rich on this project?

09:19.784 --> 09:21.183
- She's not.
- Well, someone is.

09:21.218 --> 09:24.353
- Her boyfriend?
- You mean Wes.

09:24.388 --> 09:25.488
That guy's her boss.

09:25.523 --> 09:26.923
And not even that anymore, she left.

09:26.957 --> 09:28.558
Good.

09:30.795 --> 09:32.995
Look, I got to go.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.564
I... I got a job.

09:34.598 --> 09:36.966
Monica, can you at least ask around,

09:37.000 --> 09:38.967
try and find out who threw that brick?

09:40.837 --> 09:41.603
Please.

09:44.073 --> 09:44.973
I'll try.

09:45.007 --> 09:46.341
Thanks.

09:49.145 --> 09:49.645
See you.

10:00.756 --> 10:02.247
Hey.

10:02.248 --> 10:03.555
_

10:03.556 --> 10:05.766
_

10:05.767 --> 10:08.028
Uh, around.

10:08.029 --> 10:11.329
_

10:11.366 --> 10:13.033
Well...

10:18.940 --> 10:20.307
Okay, well, first of all,

10:20.342 --> 10:24.945
we didn't use anything
last night if you recall.

10:24.980 --> 10:26.380
So this morning,

10:26.414 --> 10:28.515
I had to go to the pharmacy

10:28.549 --> 10:30.517
and take that morning after thing.

10:30.551 --> 10:32.987
And now I feel really nauseous.

10:32.988 --> 10:33.622
_

10:33.623 --> 10:36.052
_

10:36.903 --> 10:38.592
Why would you think that?

10:38.593 --> 10:43.674
_

10:43.684 --> 10:46.332
Wow, uh, okay.

10:46.367 --> 10:47.766
But first of all,

10:47.801 --> 10:51.404
I was only with Ty for a couple of weeks

10:51.438 --> 10:54.173
before he left. And, second,

10:54.208 --> 10:55.574
I'm not sleeping with Tank.

10:55.575 --> 10:57.615
_

10:57.620 --> 10:59.278
No, why didn't you have anything?

11:00.069 --> 11:02.097
_

11:02.398 --> 11:06.753
_

11:07.453 --> 11:09.121
You know what? I have to go.

11:10.822 --> 11:12.219
_

11:13.220 --> 11:15.861
_

11:15.862 --> 11:18.861
_

11:18.898 --> 11:20.832
I am happy, but...

11:22.735 --> 11:23.801
I have a boyfriend.

11:25.552 --> 11:28.560
_

11:28.564 --> 11:30.808
No, I...

11:30.843 --> 11:33.211
I mean, yes.

11:33.246 --> 11:34.079
It shouldn't have happened

11:34.113 --> 11:35.913
while I was dating somebody else.

11:36.790 --> 11:38.675
_

11:38.683 --> 11:40.817
It doesn't matter if I'm into him.

11:40.852 --> 11:42.053
We're together.

11:42.087 --> 11:43.787
And I cheated on him.

11:43.821 --> 11:45.222
Emmett, I did the one thing

11:45.257 --> 11:47.024
I swore I would never do.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.910
_

11:49.911 --> 11:51.228
Yes, I am.

11:51.263 --> 11:54.231
But you of all people should understand

11:54.266 --> 11:56.767
how crappy I feel right now.

12:02.430 --> 12:06.958
_

12:07.645 --> 12:09.412
I know.

12:11.749 --> 12:15.218
I'll text you after I talk with him.

12:27.561 --> 12:30.594
I cannot believe that
I took a pill yesterday

12:30.629 --> 12:33.464
to prevent me from becoming pregnant.

12:33.498 --> 12:36.667
I could have had a thing growing inside me

12:36.701 --> 12:39.670
that could have turned into a person.

12:39.704 --> 12:43.975
Yeah, that image of you
and Emmett as teen parents

12:44.009 --> 12:44.809
is kind of freaking me out right now.

12:46.211 --> 12:48.045
So what's going on with you and Tank?

12:48.080 --> 12:50.213
He and I...

12:52.517 --> 12:55.386
Never really clicked like that.

12:55.420 --> 12:57.388
I kept trying to make it work.

12:57.422 --> 13:00.457
And it never did.

13:00.492 --> 13:01.792
Uh.

13:03.127 --> 13:04.628
Hey.

13:04.663 --> 13:05.396
She cool?

13:08.365 --> 13:09.565
Yeah.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.201
I don't know who did the drive-by,

13:11.235 --> 13:13.536
but this guy named Nacho Rivera

13:13.570 --> 13:15.071
arranged it.

13:17.809 --> 13:19.042
Exactly.

13:19.076 --> 13:21.377
Well, thanks for letting me know.

13:21.462 --> 13:24.865
Seriously, the crew that Nacho runs with,

13:24.899 --> 13:25.832
they can do a lot more

13:25.867 --> 13:27.467
than throw bricks through your window.

13:27.501 --> 13:29.736
I'm just gonna talk to him.

13:29.770 --> 13:31.704
Do what you want.

13:31.739 --> 13:32.639
At least I tried.

13:38.178 --> 13:40.713
Talk to who about what?

13:43.817 --> 13:46.653
Somebody threw a brick into K&D

13:46.687 --> 13:47.587
with a threatening note

13:47.621 --> 13:49.554
that said to stay out or East Riverside.

13:49.589 --> 13:51.189
Whoa.

13:51.223 --> 13:53.692
And you didn't tell me?

13:53.726 --> 13:56.060
It just happened the other night.

13:56.095 --> 13:57.296
You had a lot going on.

13:57.330 --> 13:59.364
I still would've liked to know.

13:59.399 --> 14:00.832
I'm dealing with it.

14:03.503 --> 14:04.336
How?

14:04.370 --> 14:07.505
By going and confronting some gangbanger?

14:07.539 --> 14:09.373
Nice.

14:09.408 --> 14:11.942
Well, I'm assuming that
he's not the greatest guy

14:11.976 --> 14:13.611
if he's hurling bricks
at our mother's head.

14:13.645 --> 14:16.180
Bay, I got it, okay?

14:28.967 --> 14:31.304
_

14:35.610 --> 14:38.105
_

14:43.160 --> 14:44.204
_

14:44.605 --> 14:47.614
_

14:51.140 --> 14:52.349
_

15:24.447 --> 15:25.680
Hey.

15:25.714 --> 15:27.147
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

15:27.182 --> 15:29.684
- Oh, Tank.
- Uh, I de-pledged.

15:29.718 --> 15:31.085
What?

15:31.119 --> 15:32.754
Yeah, I de-pledged the fraternity.

15:32.788 --> 15:34.389
I'm gone. I'm out. It's over.

15:34.423 --> 15:36.758
Why would you do that?

15:36.792 --> 15:38.025
I mean, you kept telling me

15:38.059 --> 15:39.026
that they were supposed to be my brothers,

15:39.060 --> 15:41.295
but no one stuck up for
me, no one defended me.

15:41.329 --> 15:43.197
And you were right.

15:43.231 --> 15:44.866
What do I know?

15:44.900 --> 15:47.167
So I came home after we
staked out that Mandy girl

15:47.202 --> 15:48.535
and I ran into a bunch of
guys in the commons room.

15:48.569 --> 15:51.471
And they were talking about
porn stars and threesomes.

15:51.506 --> 15:52.272
And then I go to the bathroom

15:52.306 --> 15:53.907
and it's just covered in puke.

15:53.941 --> 15:55.876
I mean, covered.

15:56.744 --> 15:58.678
I don't know, it just kind of hit me.

15:58.713 --> 16:01.715
Bay's right.

16:01.749 --> 16:03.517
This isn't me.

16:03.551 --> 16:05.952
Okay, so you did it for
you then, right? For you.

16:05.986 --> 16:06.953
No, I knew how much it bothered you.

16:06.987 --> 16:08.955
And what you think is important to me.

16:08.989 --> 16:10.123
Okay, uh, Tank.

16:10.157 --> 16:11.791
- The thing is...
- Hey, look, I appreciate

16:11.825 --> 16:13.927
what you're gonna say, but it's done.

16:13.961 --> 16:15.929
At least we won't be
fighting about that anymore.

16:15.963 --> 16:17.397
And I'm so glad I have you

16:17.431 --> 16:20.033
because, um, my entire pledge class

16:20.067 --> 16:21.767
is banned from talking to me for a year.

16:21.802 --> 16:24.270
- What?! That's insane!
- Yeah.

16:24.305 --> 16:25.338
I know, it kinda freaked me out.

16:25.372 --> 16:27.740
And they're making me move
out of here, like, pronto.

16:27.774 --> 16:30.743
So, you know, it's just...

16:30.777 --> 16:32.778
it's just kind of a lot.

16:32.813 --> 16:36.415
- Tank, listen...
- Honestly, thank you...

16:36.450 --> 16:39.251
for pushing me and challenging me.

16:39.285 --> 16:41.754
I feel like dating you
has totally changed me.

16:41.788 --> 16:44.189
I know this sounds kind of cheesy,

16:44.223 --> 16:45.791
but, um...

16:45.826 --> 16:47.159
I'm psyched to see how else

16:47.193 --> 16:48.026
I'm gonna be changed with you.

16:49.195 --> 16:50.596
Me too.

16:57.710 --> 16:59.643
Kathryn this is fantastic.
Thank you so much.

16:59.677 --> 17:02.045
Oh, wow. Well, did you have a good day?

17:02.079 --> 17:03.213
Did you get your window fixed?

17:03.247 --> 17:06.215
Angelo fixed it. It's all taken care of.

17:06.250 --> 17:07.617
It was no big deal.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.085
I can't believe that they have that

17:09.119 --> 17:11.186
vandalism happening in your neighborhood.

17:11.222 --> 17:12.689
I mean, what is the point to that?

17:12.723 --> 17:15.858
- I don't get it.
- Well, there was a point.

17:15.894 --> 17:16.960
I'm just glad no one

17:16.993 --> 17:17.761
was there when it happened.

17:18.930 --> 17:22.132
Oh, and where is your beautiful car?

17:22.165 --> 17:24.599
Oh, that.

17:24.635 --> 17:25.701
I, um, had to give that back.

17:25.736 --> 17:29.271
I decided... well, Wes
and I mutually decided...

17:29.306 --> 17:30.406
She is not working with him anymore.

17:30.441 --> 17:32.575
So you're not doing the East Riverside

17:32.609 --> 17:33.743
project anymore?

17:33.777 --> 17:34.844
You were so excited about that.

17:34.878 --> 17:36.412
Is it because of that thing

17:36.447 --> 17:37.012
that you showed me in the book?

17:40.015 --> 17:41.312
It was a bunch of things.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.852
- Hi.
- Hey, honey.

17:42.966 --> 17:43.666
- Hey.
- Sorry, sorry.

17:43.700 --> 17:45.200
Happy Birthday, Regina.

17:45.235 --> 17:47.169
Thank you.

17:47.203 --> 17:49.237
Oh, I'll get you a plate.

17:49.271 --> 17:50.972
You've done enough.

17:51.007 --> 17:52.373
- Let me do it.
- Thank you.

17:52.408 --> 17:54.042
Can I have the salad, sweetie?

17:54.076 --> 17:55.243
Yes.

17:55.277 --> 17:57.245
- Anybody want... oh.
- Let's switch.

17:57.279 --> 17:58.346
Here you go. I miss starch.

17:58.380 --> 17:59.548
You're not gonna eat your greens?

17:59.582 --> 18:00.549
No.

18:08.024 --> 18:10.559
I was right there when it happened.

18:10.593 --> 18:12.493
It barely missed us.

18:12.528 --> 18:14.529
She told me she saw it
when she came into work.

18:14.564 --> 18:16.764
Yeah, well, she obviously
didn't tell John and Kathryn

18:16.798 --> 18:18.032
the whole story either.

18:18.067 --> 18:21.001
Regina always wants to
do everything herself.

18:21.116 --> 18:24.352
I feel bad going behind her back like this,

18:24.386 --> 18:27.155
but she is not taking it seriously enough.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.490
No, I'm glad you came to me.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.424
That was the right thing to do.

18:30.459 --> 18:34.162
Look, if you're ever
worried about anything,

18:34.196 --> 18:35.763
I want you to come to me,

18:35.797 --> 18:37.898
always.

18:37.932 --> 18:38.999
Got it?

18:41.283 --> 18:43.817
Thank you.

18:43.852 --> 18:46.120
So how is Tank?

18:46.154 --> 18:48.522
That kid is so sweet.

18:48.557 --> 18:51.791
He's okay. He's good.

18:51.825 --> 18:53.126
So I can't believe that
you got blackmailed.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.695
- What are you talking about?
- The brick...

18:55.730 --> 18:57.597
with the note.

18:59.580 --> 19:00.647
Whoops.

19:04.017 --> 19:06.753
What note?

19:06.787 --> 19:08.855
I was going to tell you.

19:08.889 --> 19:11.023
I just wanted to get a handle on it first.

19:11.058 --> 19:12.225
Did you know about this too?

19:12.259 --> 19:14.694
Just give her a chance to talk.

19:14.729 --> 19:16.262
I just truly don't think

19:16.296 --> 19:18.064
that there is anything
to worry about anymore.

19:18.188 --> 19:20.423
So Daphne kept this from us too?

19:20.457 --> 19:21.958
That is my fault.

19:21.992 --> 19:23.359
I told her that I was gonna talk to you.

19:23.393 --> 19:25.027
And tell us half the story.

19:25.062 --> 19:25.995
I got fired, okay?

19:28.598 --> 19:30.066
The point is I'm not even

19:30.100 --> 19:31.733
working on the project anymore.

19:31.768 --> 19:33.569
I promise you, it's a non-issue.

19:33.603 --> 19:34.703
It'll go away.

19:41.604 --> 19:42.952
_

19:42.955 --> 19:45.848
He de-pledged his fraternity

19:45.882 --> 19:46.481
as some kind of like...

19:46.515 --> 19:48.049
grand gesture for me.

19:48.850 --> 19:51.126
_

19:51.132 --> 19:53.254
Technically, yes. For now.

19:56.121 --> 19:58.559
Of course, but what did you want me to do?

19:59.460 --> 20:01.638
_

20:01.640 --> 20:03.098
Wait, Emmett!

20:06.469 --> 20:08.103
Hey, you're blocking me in

20:08.137 --> 20:08.903
and I have to run out.

20:08.937 --> 20:11.239
Could you move your car, please?

20:11.273 --> 20:14.042
Where're you going?

20:14.076 --> 20:14.775
Sharee's.

20:15.978 --> 20:20.180
I've lived with you for two years.

20:20.215 --> 20:24.101
You really think I don't
know when you're lying to me?

20:24.109 --> 20:27.388
Can you just cover for me
in case someone asks, please?

20:27.422 --> 20:28.656
- No.
- Bay.

20:28.690 --> 20:30.357
"Bay." What?

20:30.392 --> 20:31.492
She's my mom too.

20:31.527 --> 20:33.794
If you're going, I'm going.

20:40.936 --> 20:44.338
- Regina.
- I'm sorry.

20:44.372 --> 20:46.907
I should have told you everything.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.742
I was just trying to avoid all of this.

20:50.444 --> 20:52.712
We're not mad at you, Regina.

20:52.747 --> 20:55.549
We're worried about you.

20:55.583 --> 20:56.983
You think I don't know how hard it is

20:57.018 --> 20:58.618
to run a business by yourself?

20:58.653 --> 21:00.186
It's not just the business.

21:00.220 --> 21:02.422
I felt like I was finally
doing something important.

21:02.456 --> 21:04.758
You think you can get your job back?

21:04.792 --> 21:05.659
Probably not.

21:05.693 --> 21:08.494
He's dropping the project anyway.

21:08.529 --> 21:09.696
That's a mistake.

21:09.730 --> 21:11.330
You're letting fringe
elements run the show?

21:11.365 --> 21:14.200
It's a terrible example
to set for the kids.

21:14.234 --> 21:16.536
I...

21:16.570 --> 21:18.304
Thought you were upset with me

21:18.338 --> 21:19.572
for being involved in something

21:19.606 --> 21:20.440
- that could be dangerous.
- Regina.

21:20.474 --> 21:24.209
You take precautions, you'd be smart.

21:25.379 --> 21:27.313
But you do not cower.

21:27.347 --> 21:30.516
Wow, um, I'm surprised.

21:30.551 --> 21:32.351
Why? If I believed in something

21:32.386 --> 21:33.419
as much as you believe

21:33.454 --> 21:34.920
in this project, you can bet your ass

21:34.955 --> 21:36.289
I wouldn't let thugs change my mind.

21:38.024 --> 21:38.624
Give 'em hell.

21:49.535 --> 21:51.937
Oh, nice shot.

21:51.972 --> 21:53.271
- Good shot.
- Nice, two out of three?

21:56.450 --> 21:58.689
_

22:02.290 --> 22:03.685
_

22:04.686 --> 22:06.890
_

22:06.891 --> 22:08.365
_

22:08.366 --> 22:10.413
_

22:10.414 --> 22:12.080
_

22:12.560 --> 22:15.120
_

22:15.121 --> 22:17.265
_

22:17.266 --> 22:20.838
_

22:21.939 --> 22:23.620
_

22:24.637 --> 22:26.471
Hey, I'm Bay.

22:26.506 --> 22:29.307
Uh, this is my friend Daphne.

22:30.732 --> 22:32.183
Hey, what's up? I'm Nacho.

22:35.147 --> 22:36.113
Hi.

22:36.148 --> 22:37.181
That's my brother Martin.

22:37.215 --> 22:39.617
- What's up?
- Hey.

22:39.651 --> 22:40.584
Good to meet you.

22:40.619 --> 22:42.785
So what's the deal?

22:42.819 --> 22:44.320
Are you guys deaf?

22:44.355 --> 22:47.357
Uh, well, she is. I'm hearing.

22:47.391 --> 22:49.659
Could we play you guys?

22:49.693 --> 22:51.461
You two know how to play?

22:51.495 --> 22:53.530
A little.

22:53.564 --> 22:55.431
I'll rack 'em.

22:55.466 --> 22:57.267
Oh, you know what?

22:57.301 --> 22:59.636
Why don't we play for something?

22:59.670 --> 23:01.037
I mean, that's always more fun.

23:02.739 --> 23:03.773
How much you got?

23:03.807 --> 23:05.475
Oh, no, not money.

23:05.509 --> 23:08.878
How about...

23:08.912 --> 23:11.613
if you guys win,

23:11.648 --> 23:15.217
then we will let you buy us some beer.

23:15.251 --> 23:17.019
Oh. Oh, okay.

23:17.054 --> 23:18.854
So you'll let us spend our money on you?

23:18.889 --> 23:21.356
Pretty much.

23:21.471 --> 23:23.239
Sounds good to me.

23:23.273 --> 23:24.573
No arguments here.

23:24.607 --> 23:26.809
And if we win?

23:28.745 --> 23:29.578
If we win,

23:29.612 --> 23:33.482
you guys owe us a favor.

23:35.485 --> 23:36.218
What kind of favor?

23:36.253 --> 23:39.120
Oh, I'll tell you when we win.

23:40.423 --> 23:42.291
Can't wait.

23:53.451 --> 23:55.218
Great.

24:06.893 --> 24:12.008
_

24:14.009 --> 24:16.750
_

24:16.751 --> 24:19.410
_

24:21.347 --> 24:23.948
- What are you guys saying?
- How...

24:23.982 --> 24:24.815
good you guys are.

24:35.921 --> 24:38.488
Do you sleep here?

24:38.523 --> 24:40.724
Sometimes.

24:40.758 --> 24:42.960
So what are you doing here?

24:42.994 --> 24:44.428
Don't you have a family, a husband,

24:44.462 --> 24:46.663
a big birthday dinner?

24:46.698 --> 24:49.934
- How'd you know that?
- It's a numbers thing.

24:50.038 --> 24:51.238
Phone numbers, addresses, birthdays...

24:51.323 --> 24:54.157
I see them once, they're in here forever.

24:55.926 --> 24:59.562
Anyways, Happy Birthday.

24:59.596 --> 25:00.763
Thank you.

25:05.569 --> 25:07.236
You once told me

25:07.271 --> 25:08.771
that you truly believe

25:08.805 --> 25:10.673
in revitalizing East Riverside,

25:10.707 --> 25:13.242
not just for profit.

25:13.277 --> 25:15.111
But that we would be doing something good

25:15.145 --> 25:15.744
for the community.

25:17.581 --> 25:20.850
Please, don't pull the plug

25:20.884 --> 25:21.817
because of a couple of bullies.

25:23.523 --> 25:24.689
I'm guessing you're not here to convince me

25:24.724 --> 25:26.925
to do this all by myself.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.394
No.

25:28.428 --> 25:31.162
I would ask you for my job back...

25:33.499 --> 25:36.701
assuming you wouldn't use
me to fleece my friends.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.302
Oh, you had to get that in, didn't you?

25:38.417 --> 25:42.921
A project like this could be life-changing

25:42.955 --> 25:44.789
for so many people.

25:44.824 --> 25:47.391
Please, reconsider.

25:58.437 --> 26:00.304
All yours, ladies.

26:02.074 --> 26:05.042
Careful not to sink that stripe

26:05.076 --> 26:06.544
'cause then all I have to do

26:06.578 --> 26:09.614
is pocket the 8-ball and it's game over.

26:09.648 --> 26:10.881
And game on.

26:20.192 --> 26:21.725
- Damn.
- Nice.

26:31.401 --> 26:32.930
_

26:32.931 --> 26:36.299
_

26:36.607 --> 26:37.774
I love you, Wilke!

26:39.577 --> 26:41.611
You're a little tiburon, huh?

26:48.819 --> 26:51.054
You won. You won!

26:51.088 --> 26:53.423
We won!

26:54.525 --> 26:56.459
Well, apparently, we owe you a favor.

26:56.494 --> 26:59.228
Oh, you do. You do.

26:59.262 --> 27:00.596
Uh...

27:08.939 --> 27:10.707
The favor...

27:10.741 --> 27:12.909
is that you have to leave my mom alone.

27:12.943 --> 27:13.609
What are you talking about?

27:16.412 --> 27:17.713
I'm Daphne Vasquez.

27:19.482 --> 27:21.917
Regina Vasquez is my mom.

27:24.654 --> 27:28.055
Yeah, I thought you looked familiar.

27:28.089 --> 27:29.557
Let's go.

27:39.501 --> 27:40.201
Nacho!

27:40.256 --> 27:41.856
We didn't mean to trick
you. We just want to talk.

27:41.890 --> 27:42.957
No no no no no.

27:42.991 --> 27:45.160
How about you listen instead?!

27:45.194 --> 27:46.428
Your mom and her white boyfriend

27:46.462 --> 27:47.728
think they're gonna bulldoze in here

27:47.763 --> 27:49.897
with their J.Crew and Aba-phony and Fitch

27:49.932 --> 27:52.266
and make lofts and places for brunch.

27:52.300 --> 27:53.467
Please slow down. I can't follow

27:53.501 --> 27:54.801
- when you talk that fast.
- Not that it matters to you,

27:54.835 --> 27:56.537
but there's a history here.

27:56.571 --> 27:58.572
There's a community.

27:58.636 --> 27:59.703
My dad's a bus driver.

27:59.737 --> 28:00.938
Where's he gonna go when the rent's triple?

28:00.972 --> 28:02.873
Huh? Where are me and my friends

28:02.908 --> 28:03.974
gonna hang out when this place

28:04.009 --> 28:06.143
- is a mall parking lot?
- There'll be jobs...

28:06.177 --> 28:08.279
And money and better education.

28:08.313 --> 28:10.381
You know what?

28:10.415 --> 28:12.482
We don't need saving.

28:12.517 --> 28:14.818
And if we did, we'd do it ourselves.

28:14.852 --> 28:16.086
But we haven't saved ourselves!

28:16.121 --> 28:20.757
I was afraid to park my
car on the street tonight.

28:20.792 --> 28:23.460
This place has turned.

28:23.494 --> 28:27.096
And you know what? We deserve better.

28:27.131 --> 28:30.033
My mom was just trying to help.

28:30.067 --> 28:32.536
Your mom is a sellout and whore.

28:32.570 --> 28:33.904
Whoa, wait a min...

28:37.041 --> 28:39.142
She quit!

28:39.176 --> 28:40.577
All right?

28:40.611 --> 28:41.845
She's not working for him anymore.

28:41.879 --> 28:42.779
That's what we came here to tell you!

28:44.649 --> 28:45.849
So you leave her out of it!

28:45.883 --> 28:46.450
Got it?!

28:48.753 --> 28:50.654
You leave her out!

28:53.424 --> 28:55.024
Let's go.

29:16.920 --> 29:18.300
_

29:22.481 --> 29:29.001
_

29:32.802 --> 29:35.602
_

29:40.303 --> 29:44.103
_

29:49.804 --> 29:54.004
_

29:57.405 --> 29:58.345
_

30:01.046 --> 30:04.159
_

30:08.560 --> 30:10.560
_

30:10.561 --> 30:12.760
_

30:12.761 --> 30:16.000
_

30:16.001 --> 30:18.990
_

30:18.991 --> 30:22.766
_

30:22.767 --> 30:26.626
_

30:26.627 --> 30:30.002
_

30:30.003 --> 30:31.433
_

30:32.334 --> 30:35.627
_

30:35.628 --> 30:38.238
_

30:38.239 --> 30:42.640
_

30:42.641 --> 30:45.031
_

30:45.032 --> 30:47.620
_

30:47.621 --> 30:49.635
_

30:51.150 --> 30:56.470
_

30:56.471 --> 30:59.011
_

31:09.445 --> 31:10.278
Mom.

31:11.815 --> 31:13.582
Hey, mom.

31:16.486 --> 31:17.819
Oh, hey.

31:17.853 --> 31:18.886
There you are.

31:18.921 --> 31:20.755
Where've you been?

31:20.789 --> 31:22.790
I got my job back.

31:22.825 --> 31:25.793
On the East Riverside project?

31:25.828 --> 31:27.461
You don't have to worry.

31:30.132 --> 31:33.635
Are you determined to get yourself hurt?

31:33.669 --> 31:35.369
Of course not.

31:35.403 --> 31:40.008
People there are mad at you, mom,

31:40.042 --> 31:41.308
like really mad.

31:41.343 --> 31:46.114
So I should run away?

31:46.148 --> 31:48.348
Is that what I taught you?

31:48.382 --> 31:50.751
To run and hide?

31:52.219 --> 31:54.420
People there...

31:55.790 --> 31:58.158
people there hate us.

32:00.762 --> 32:02.295
When you're desperate, you lash out.

32:04.565 --> 32:06.733
And if things were reversed
and I was still there

32:06.768 --> 32:08.935
and someone else had
lucked into all of this,

32:08.970 --> 32:11.337
I would hope that I
would not believe rumors.

32:13.407 --> 32:14.741
Tonight, Bay and I...

32:14.776 --> 32:16.677
Bay and you, what?

32:19.379 --> 32:20.479
Nothing.

32:22.783 --> 32:24.650
I just don't want to lose you.

32:24.685 --> 32:26.852
And neither does Bay.

32:26.887 --> 32:28.821
Sweetie.

32:28.855 --> 32:31.490
Nothing is gonna happen to me.

32:31.524 --> 32:33.059
I promise.

32:36.930 --> 32:39.264
It's your decision.

32:41.434 --> 32:42.935
I'm going to bed.

33:07.906 --> 33:09.600
_

33:09.601 --> 33:12.225
_

33:14.410 --> 33:16.684
_

33:21.105 --> 33:22.090
_

33:35.153 --> 33:36.587
I want both of you to know

33:36.622 --> 33:38.322
that we take this kind of thing

33:38.357 --> 33:39.957
very seriously.

33:43.127 --> 33:44.661
Emmett, I've spoken with your mom.

33:44.695 --> 33:48.899
All we need is for you
to confirm the story.

33:50.950 --> 33:52.558
_

34:01.000 --> 34:05.681
_

34:05.684 --> 34:07.450
Are you saying that Matthew

34:07.485 --> 34:10.587
did not pretend to be someone else online?

34:12.487 --> 34:13.237
_

34:13.239 --> 34:15.824
He did not lure you to a meeting place

34:15.859 --> 34:16.926
and attack you?

34:18.427 --> 34:19.568
_

34:20.259 --> 34:24.426
_

34:27.827 --> 34:31.554
_

34:34.426 --> 34:36.949
- _
- _

34:43.351 --> 34:45.732
_

34:53.000 --> 34:55.165
_

34:55.166 --> 34:58.120
_

34:58.121 --> 35:01.660
_

35:01.661 --> 35:05.573
_

35:05.574 --> 35:07.280
_

35:07.851 --> 35:09.971
_

35:09.972 --> 35:11.500
_

35:12.501 --> 35:13.901
_

35:15.102 --> 35:17.850
_

35:39.751 --> 35:42.070
_

35:42.771 --> 35:45.326
_

35:45.827 --> 35:47.776
_

35:47.777 --> 35:51.170
_

35:54.650 --> 35:58.230
_

35:58.831 --> 35:59.701
_

36:20.669 --> 36:21.721
What's going on?

36:23.640 --> 36:24.707
You said to come to you

36:24.741 --> 36:25.875
if I ever needed anything.

36:25.990 --> 36:27.390
Tell me.

36:32.129 --> 36:34.029
If we're gonna...

36:36.515 --> 36:39.717
I need you to learn how to sign.

36:42.055 --> 36:44.789
I thought you read lips.

36:44.824 --> 36:47.059
I do, but...

36:47.093 --> 36:48.360
It's really hard.

36:48.394 --> 36:51.330
Especially with your accent.

36:51.364 --> 36:52.864
I'm so sorry.

36:52.898 --> 36:55.567
I'm just really bad at it.

36:55.601 --> 36:58.070
I don't care.

36:58.104 --> 37:01.373
Anything that you can do will help me.

37:05.578 --> 37:08.113
I feel terrible.

37:08.147 --> 37:08.880
Don't.

37:10.583 --> 37:12.784
I should have asked you sooner.

37:17.556 --> 37:19.891
There's also something else

37:19.925 --> 37:22.059
that I wanted to ask.

37:23.762 --> 37:24.729
Anything.

37:39.155 --> 37:41.005
_

37:42.106 --> 37:44.480
_

38:02.499 --> 38:04.366
Hi.

38:04.401 --> 38:07.102
What's going on?

38:07.137 --> 38:08.771
I'm moving in.

38:08.805 --> 38:11.574
Angelo, that's a nice gesture, but...

38:11.608 --> 38:12.408
You're my wife.

38:12.442 --> 38:15.210
And I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you or Daphne.

38:15.245 --> 38:17.847
I don't think Daphne is ready for this.

38:17.881 --> 38:20.249
It was her idea.

38:20.283 --> 38:21.984
Wh...

38:22.019 --> 38:23.419
- Hey, you're home.
- Hi.

38:23.453 --> 38:25.721
Hey, uh, what's "idea"?

38:27.157 --> 38:28.823
Idea.

38:28.858 --> 38:31.026
Idea.

38:31.061 --> 38:33.062
This was her idea.

38:33.096 --> 38:36.265
How do you feel about
mushrooms in your salad?

38:36.299 --> 38:38.300
I love...

38:38.334 --> 38:40.469
mushroom and salad.

38:41.871 --> 38:43.372
What about onions?

38:43.406 --> 38:44.973
"Onion"... oh, that makes sense.

38:45.007 --> 38:46.575
- I love onions too.
- Nice.

38:46.609 --> 38:48.310
There isn't a sign

38:48.344 --> 38:50.011
for broccoli, but when I was little,

38:50.046 --> 38:52.147
my mom and I made up

38:52.182 --> 38:53.714
"little trees."

38:53.748 --> 38:55.550
A little tree?

38:55.584 --> 38:57.351
- It's cute, right?
- It's cute.

39:36.324 --> 39:38.125
Hey.

39:41.630 --> 39:42.329
Honey?

39:43.864 --> 39:46.799
Bay's laptop was on the couch.

39:46.834 --> 39:47.934
And I thought I'd take a peak

39:47.968 --> 39:49.869
at what the weather was
gonna be like tomorrow.

39:49.903 --> 39:52.139
You can't snoop on our kids.

39:52.173 --> 39:53.640
Sweetie, I wasn't snooping.

39:53.674 --> 39:55.275
Whatever you found

39:55.309 --> 39:57.344
is not useable in a court of law,

39:57.378 --> 39:58.278
so I don't even want to know, okay?

39:58.312 --> 40:02.182
So I started to type in the word "weather."

40:04.852 --> 40:07.053
What came up?

40:07.087 --> 40:08.855
"Where in Mission Hills

40:08.889 --> 40:11.625
can I buy the morning after pill?"

40:43.000 --> 40:47.200
_

40:47.201 --> 40:50.105
_

40:50.108 --> 40:52.129
I'll tell him tomorrow.

40:52.164 --> 40:53.264
No matter what.

40:53.299 --> 40:56.167
He deserves it. You deserve it.

40:56.168 --> 41:02.165
_

41:03.609 --> 41:05.510
And I should've stopped you.

41:05.511 --> 41:13.631
_

41:13.632 --> 41:21.632
_

41:21.655 --> 41:22.292
It's okay.

41:22.293 --> 41:26.450
_

41:26.451 --> 41:27.864
Stop.

41:27.898 --> 41:30.567
Listen to me.

41:30.602 --> 41:32.502
Yesterday, I felt like

41:32.537 --> 41:34.037
the world was conspiring against us,

41:34.071 --> 41:36.540
like everything was just a mess.

41:36.541 --> 41:38.341
_

41:38.876 --> 41:43.714
There's so much that could drive us apart,

41:43.748 --> 41:46.015
but I'm not gonna let it.

41:46.050 --> 41:47.651
You are the one

41:47.685 --> 41:49.286
who I always come back to.

41:49.320 --> 41:53.724
And what happened the other night

41:53.758 --> 41:56.326
was amazing and completely right.

41:57.629 --> 42:01.330
I don't know how this is gonna work,

42:01.365 --> 42:03.867
but...

42:03.901 --> 42:04.834
we'll figure it out.

42:07.905 --> 42:09.639
We will figure it out.
