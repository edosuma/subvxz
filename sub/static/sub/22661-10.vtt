WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.637
You know, these animal
valentines you got

00:03.671 --> 00:06.774
for the kids to take to school,
they're a little racy.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.409
Like, look at
this cartoon bear.

00:08.442 --> 00:12.080
He's wearing nothing
but a bow tie.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.115
Where's he going,
a bachelorette party?

00:15.316 --> 00:17.618
I still don't understand
why every kid in the class

00:17.651 --> 00:18.552
has to get a valentine.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.788
When I was their age,
the only kids who got

00:20.821 --> 00:24.058
a full bag of valentines
were nice or foxy.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.295
Like me.

00:27.328 --> 00:30.098
You were foxy in
the third grade?

00:30.131 --> 00:32.633
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's
the year I grew into my head.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.435
Ah.
Yeah.

00:34.468 --> 00:38.139
Second grade, not so foxy.
I tipped over a lot.

00:38.172 --> 00:39.207
Yeah.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.577
So, my beautiful bride,

00:43.611 --> 00:46.080
would you like to have
"a whale of a time"

00:46.114 --> 00:48.449
this Valentine's Day?

00:48.482 --> 00:51.785
Actually, this year, I
don't want to do anything.

00:54.155 --> 00:57.525
I love that we can still
make each other laugh.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.861
No, I-I'm serious.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.831
I just, I just want
to do nothing.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.599
Yeah, this feels
like a trap.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.701
No, it's not.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.703
Look, we're always
running around,

01:09.737 --> 01:12.273
and I haven't had time
to get you something.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.875
Plus, they gave me a
standing desk at work,

01:14.908 --> 01:18.146
so I have been on my
feet for three days.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.648
I will not be the first
person to sit down.

01:21.849 --> 01:24.885
So, uh, this doing nothing
for Valentine's Day,

01:24.918 --> 01:26.254
are you serious?

01:26.287 --> 01:28.222
Yes. Yes.

01:28.256 --> 01:31.225
No going out
and no gifts.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.733
My perfect
Valentine's Day

01:39.767 --> 01:43.304
would be a quiet night at
home with the people I love.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.473
And many glasses
of wine.

01:47.808 --> 01:50.444
Okay. Well, I guess
we'll just stay here

01:50.478 --> 01:53.314
and have dinner
with my folks and the kids.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.149
That sounds perfect.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.556
Really?

02:03.824 --> 02:05.826
How many glasses of wine
have you had tonight?

02:05.859 --> 02:06.860
:
Okay.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.796
Look, bottom line is,

02:08.829 --> 02:10.731
we've celebrated
for 17 years.

02:10.764 --> 02:13.367
I'm just... I'm
over this holiday.

02:15.236 --> 02:18.172
You know, every day
I love you more and more,

02:18.206 --> 02:20.808
because as time goes by...

02:20.841 --> 02:23.211
you make me show it
less and less.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.378
Aw.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.518
So Andi doesn't want anything
for Valentine's Day?

02:30.551 --> 02:34.255
All she wants is to drink wine,
so just her normal night.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.890
That sounds like a trap.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.327
That's what I said;
but she denied it,

02:39.360 --> 02:42.530
and then we made out
for a while, so it's real.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.498
Oh, you've finally reached
that sweet spot in marriage

02:44.532 --> 02:46.234
where you could phone it in.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.868
Welcome to the bigs, kid, huh?

02:47.901 --> 02:50.504
And now I just got to figure out
a gift for Mom.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.740
Good luck with that,
little brother.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.375
I out-gift him every year.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.909
But it's cute
that he still tries.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.412
Don't take it personally.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.281
I'm the oldest;
I made her a mother.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.682
What did you bring
to the table?

03:01.715 --> 03:03.917
Well, unlike you,

03:03.951 --> 03:06.954
I didn't make her deliver a baby
that was three feet tall.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.990
The struggle only
made her love me more.

03:10.023 --> 03:14.528
They put him in the nursery;
people thought he worked there.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.930
Oh, I know what I'll do.

03:16.964 --> 03:20.000
I'll just slide the gift
I bought for Andi over to Mom.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.671
Yeah. A 14-karat-gold necklace
with pictures of the kids on it.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.506
Oh, her grandchildren
will rest on her heart.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.341
Is there a way
to bet on this?

03:27.375 --> 03:29.977
I'd like to put
my money on Adam.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.345
What you boys
don't understand is,

03:31.379 --> 03:33.347
it's not the gift,
it's the giver.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.683
We'll see.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.318
I think I got
a good shot.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.787
This could be the year
that Mom says to you:

03:39.820 --> 03:41.655
"Mm, it's the thought
that counts."

03:43.824 --> 03:45.993
Thanks for letting me
borrow your slow cooker.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.028
Yeah, well,
we had to hide this

03:48.061 --> 03:49.997
after Teddy used it
to boil Emme's Barbies.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.300
Yeah. It was
very disturbing.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.369
The heads are
the last thing to melt.
Ugh.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.904
And they float.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.506
Ugh.

03:58.539 --> 03:59.873
Ooh.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.542
What's this?

04:01.575 --> 04:02.776
Mm.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.445
"To Andi,
Happy Valentine's Day,

04:04.478 --> 04:06.314
love, Adam"

04:07.748 --> 04:08.816
Open it.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.786
Oh, I don't think I should.
Seriously?

04:12.820 --> 04:13.987
No, I'm definitely going to.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.456
I just felt like
I should say that.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.296
Ooh, shiny!
Oh!

04:22.330 --> 04:24.798
Oh, look, and it's got pictures
of the kids on it.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.067
That is so sweet.
But I thought you told him

04:27.100 --> 04:29.036
you didn't want anything
for Valentine's Day.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.305
I did, but he didn't listen.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.341
That usually makes me so mad.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.777
Oh, it's beautiful.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.479
Oh.

04:38.512 --> 04:42.350
I have the most thoughtful
husband in the whole world.

04:42.383 --> 04:45.986
I have the most thoughtful son
in the whole world.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.359
*

05:00.133 --> 05:02.069
I saw this necklace
and I thought,

05:02.102 --> 05:05.406
"There is no one who deserves
this more than my mother."

05:08.742 --> 05:11.044
Now, I don't want to
put words in your mouth,

05:11.078 --> 05:13.381
but it's kind of
the best gift ever, huh?

05:14.382 --> 05:16.450
Oh, I-I don't like
to think of it

05:16.484 --> 05:19.853
as a competition
between you boys, but...

05:19.887 --> 05:22.356
this is gonna be
hard to beat.

05:22.390 --> 05:25.025
I'm glad you like
the new guy's gift.

05:25.058 --> 05:28.396
Now, let's see what
your firstborn got you.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.931
Go get 'em, Donny.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.633
I think you're gonna
love it so much

05:32.666 --> 05:34.735
that next year I'm gonna
have to give you a necklace

05:34.768 --> 05:35.736
with a picture of

05:35.769 --> 05:38.739
this on it.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.042
Huh.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.777
It's a damn cactus!

05:43.811 --> 05:45.078
Uh-huh.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.647
Are you throwing the game?

05:46.680 --> 05:49.450
I know what this is.

05:49.483 --> 05:52.152
This is the beginning of a
scavenger hunt to the real gift.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.721
Where's the clue?
Underneath?

05:53.754 --> 05:56.624
No, Ma, you're always
saying how you love

05:56.657 --> 05:58.792
going to Arizona and
seeing all the cactuses.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.828
She likes to swim,
too; does that mean

06:00.861 --> 06:03.464
you're gonna throw a
bucket of water on her?

06:03.497 --> 06:05.466
Maybe you're mixed up.

06:05.499 --> 06:08.469
Okay. This is from me.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.571
Your firstborn.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.172
I made you a mommy.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.042
Well, it's the thought
that counts.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.411
There it is.

06:17.445 --> 06:20.914
Joe, why don't you
take that outside for me?

06:20.948 --> 06:24.017
Oh, yes, this cactus
will love the snow.

06:24.051 --> 06:27.421
I'm gonna go see
how my new necklace looks.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.424
If this is what my son got me,

06:30.458 --> 06:32.893
I can't wait to see what
my husband gets me.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.865
What are you doing to me?

06:37.898 --> 06:40.167
What?

06:40.200 --> 06:41.935
You told me you were
getting her chocolates,

06:41.969 --> 06:43.537
so I got her flowers.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.739
Now the flowers are
just gonna sit in the trash

06:45.773 --> 06:47.741
with this-this blowfish
in a pot.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.910
I didn't mean
to ruin your day.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.479
I was just trying to ruin his.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.080
It's not ruined.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.449
Valentine's Day isn't over yet.

06:55.483 --> 06:58.151
The firstborn will rise again.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.155
Come on, Donny, let's head
to the Hallmark store

07:02.189 --> 07:05.459
and see if we can pull out
of this nosedive.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.697
Happy Valentine's Day!

07:09.730 --> 07:11.565
Yay.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.203
A book?

07:17.805 --> 07:20.440
Are you mad at us?

07:21.809 --> 07:23.210
Ah, we're just kidding.
Ah!

07:24.512 --> 07:26.213
Happy Valentine's Day.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.215
Oh, did you see
their faces?

07:28.248 --> 07:30.618
They thought they were
gonna have to read.
I know.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.219
Oh, wait.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.955
Valentine's Day
isn't over yet.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.624
It's time for
Daddy's gift.

07:36.657 --> 07:39.059
Daddy's gift?

07:40.594 --> 07:42.195
I thought Daddy
didn't get a gift.

07:42.229 --> 07:45.566
That's what Mommy said
and Daddy believed her.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.177
Open it.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.747
I don't want to.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.550
No, go ahead.

08:05.553 --> 08:09.089
Uh, o-okay, b-but before I do,

08:09.122 --> 08:12.960
just to be clear,
as previously agreed upon,

08:12.993 --> 08:16.564
I... I didn't get you anything.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.099
Okay, sure.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.805
Okay.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.007
I'm going in.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.022
It's a table hockey game!

08:42.055 --> 08:43.223
Where's the screen?

08:46.660 --> 08:48.962
Does if have
Wi

08:48.996 --> 08:53.000
It's just like the one I had
when I was a kid.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.301
I love it!

08:54.334 --> 08:55.302
Ah, good.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.771
I just had to show you
how much you mean to me.

08:57.805 --> 09:01.041
Oh.

09:15.823 --> 09:19.793
:
Okay. That's it.

09:19.827 --> 09:23.631
That was a great
Valentine's Day, yeah.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.733
But everything
is over now, so...

09:25.766 --> 09:27.300
Ah.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.069
:
Okay.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.204
Well, I guess I'll just
go to the kitchen,

09:31.238 --> 09:33.707
'cause everything's
over now.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.277
Okay.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.979
Here I go.

09:40.648 --> 09:43.316
Okay. Buh-bye.

09:45.986 --> 09:49.256
Okay, five bucks for anyone who
can tell me what just happened.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.225
He didn't give you
the necklace?

09:52.259 --> 09:54.361
No. It doesn't
make any sense.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.664
Unless he's got a girlfriend
who's also named Andi

09:56.697 --> 09:59.066
with three kids that look
a hell of a lot like ours.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.401
Oh, maybe the way
he's gonna give it to you

10:01.434 --> 10:02.970
is part of the surprise.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.672
Yeah, that's it, that's it.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.273
He-he invited his parents
over tonight.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.675
I bet they're gonna babysit

10:07.708 --> 10:09.677
while we go out
for a romantic dinner

10:09.710 --> 10:12.746
and then, instead of dessert,
it's the necklace.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.648
Yeah. If he hides it
in dessert, be careful.

10:14.682 --> 10:16.817
I still have a tennis bracelet
somewhere inside me.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.623
Whoa, break.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.266
Wh

10:33.300 --> 10:35.268
I thought you were coming
for dinner. It's only 3:00.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.772
We came early to give people
time to admire my necklace.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.675
Where is everyone?

10:41.709 --> 10:43.110
Uh, uh, Andi's out
running errands,

10:43.143 --> 10:45.879
but she'll be back later,
you know, at dinnertime.

10:45.913 --> 10:48.448
Aw. She left you without snacks?

10:48.481 --> 10:49.883
Don't worry,

10:49.917 --> 10:52.119
Mama's here now. Mm.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.955
I'll fix grilled cheeses.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.691
Maybe next year,
you can buy her a golden spatula

10:57.725 --> 11:00.828
so she can make a grilled cheese
for her golden boy.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.296
Hey, listen,
speaking of gifts,

11:03.330 --> 11:06.099
Andi said she didn't want a
gift, so I didn't get her one.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.736
But then she got me one.
Should I be worried?

11:08.769 --> 11:11.739
You should be changing your name
and moving to Canada.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.877
I knew it was a trap!
Yeah.

11:16.910 --> 11:20.213
I fell for that "I don't need
a gift" trick back in '69,

11:20.247 --> 11:22.816
and I spent the next month
living on my boat.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.786
Man,
Andi's gonna...

11:25.819 --> 11:28.455
Wait, we had a boat?

11:28.488 --> 11:31.792
We didn't have a boat;
I had a boat.

11:31.825 --> 11:35.295
O-Okay, okay, I got to run out
and find something for Andi.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.329
Hey, how was the Hallmark store?

11:36.363 --> 11:38.098
Oh, picked clean.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.833
I haven't seen men
fall apart like that

11:39.867 --> 11:41.869
since the first day
of basic training.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.939
Hey!
Hi, everybody!

11:45.973 --> 11:47.808
Why do people keep
showing up early?

11:47.841 --> 11:50.343
I wanted to give Mom
my new present,

11:50.377 --> 11:51.912
a pair of earrings.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.114
Earrings? I'm gonna have
to buy her mink underpants

11:54.147 --> 11:55.849
to keep up with you two.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.519
Two earrings beats
one necklace.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.188
That's math.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.490
Fine, fine.
I don't have time for this.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.258
I got to hit the mall.

12:05.292 --> 12:09.396
Apparently, to Andi,
"no gift" means "yes gift."

12:09.429 --> 12:11.765
Why can't you just give her
the gold necklace?

12:11.799 --> 12:13.400
What?

12:13.433 --> 12:15.235
What

12:15.268 --> 12:16.469
The-the necklace.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.906
The gold necklace
in the slow cooker.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.080
How do you know about that?

12:27.114 --> 12:29.216
Um, I was with Andi
when she found it.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.251
She found it?
Andi knows about the necklace?

12:32.219 --> 12:33.453
Too bad I sold the boat.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.789
Seems like you could
really use it now.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.794
We had some good times
on that boat, Pop.

12:50.570 --> 12:51.972
Are you telling me
Andi thinks

12:52.005 --> 12:53.473
I'm gonna surprise her
with the necklace

12:53.506 --> 12:55.542
at a romantic dinner?
She said no gifts.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.577
Why didn't you just give her
the necklace?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.046
She said no gifts.

13:01.148 --> 13:05.552
Keep saying that and we'll be
carving it on your tombstone.

13:05.585 --> 13:08.021
She's gonna be home any minute.

13:08.055 --> 13:11.558
If she sees that necklace
on my mom,

13:11.591 --> 13:13.426
You know, on the
upside, my cactus

13:13.460 --> 13:14.995
isn't looking so
shabby anymore.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.365
Great news, babe: I
got you some earrings.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.599
Aw!

13:19.632 --> 13:21.468
Okay, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

13:21.501 --> 13:22.970
I might still be able
to save this.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.972
I just got to get the necklace
away from Mom,

13:25.005 --> 13:27.474
give it to Andi, and then
just buy another one for Mom.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.176
How you gonna do that
without Bev knowing?

13:29.209 --> 13:31.478
I don't know.
I mean, just look at her.

13:35.248 --> 13:38.018
I'm gonna need the Jaws of Life
to pry it out of her hands.

13:39.887 --> 13:40.888
Just tell her the truth.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.622
You bought it for Andi
and she has to give it back.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.624
Yeah, do that.
It's too late for you.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.259
Save me!

13:49.596 --> 13:50.898
Oh, hi, Don!

13:50.931 --> 13:51.899
Marcy.

13:51.932 --> 13:55.002
Um, okay, who's hungry?

13:55.035 --> 13:57.404
Oh, forgot napkins.
Uh, wait, Ma...

13:57.437 --> 13:59.639
No, no, no. Don't start
until I get my grilled cheese.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.509
When she gets mad,
she throws food in the trash.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.613
Here we go.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.982
Uh, s-so, Ma,

14:09.016 --> 14:10.951
hey, you know what
I was thinking?

14:10.984 --> 14:13.053
I should have your
necklace engraved.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.621
You know, make it
more personal.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.623
Yeah. Give it to me now.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.591
It's already personal;

14:18.625 --> 14:20.928
it's got pictures
of my grandkids on it.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.595
Oh...

14:24.297 --> 14:26.633
The truth is...

14:26.666 --> 14:30.270
I bought it from a
gypsy; it's fake gold.

14:30.303 --> 14:31.604
BEV:
What?

14:31.638 --> 14:33.173
And I don't want
that fake gold

14:33.206 --> 14:35.442
giving you a nasty rash,
so cough it up.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.110
Mm. No!

14:37.144 --> 14:39.312
If people ask,
I'll just tell 'em

14:39.346 --> 14:42.382
I got the nasty rash
from my loving son.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.423
You might want
to mention

14:50.457 --> 14:52.459
the necklace in there
somewhere, too.

14:54.694 --> 14:55.662
Andi!

14:55.695 --> 14:57.164
Hi, honey. Oh.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.631
Your parents
are already here, huh?

14:58.665 --> 15:00.167
:
Yeah.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.502
So, we going out or something?

15:02.535 --> 15:05.005
Should I go upstairs and change?

15:05.038 --> 15:06.639
Yeah, yeah. Maybe
go change, yeah.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.942
And-and take your time.
And if you get tired,

15:08.976 --> 15:11.945
just go to bed. I'll
see you in the morning.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.547
Andi, come look
at my present.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.715
No, no, no, no!

15:15.748 --> 15:18.185
Uh, no, no, no! Okay.
Whoa!

15:18.218 --> 15:20.087
Yeah. You look...
Wait, Adam, what
are you doing?!

15:20.120 --> 15:21.654
Well, you look...
you look so cold.

15:21.688 --> 15:24.624
Okay, there you go!

15:24.657 --> 15:26.426
Hey, Andi, you know,
you know what I was thinking?

15:26.459 --> 15:28.128
Since it's
Valentine's Day,

15:28.161 --> 15:30.964
we should only look
at each other. Huh?

15:34.001 --> 15:36.103
Adam, honey, you don't have
to play this game, all right?

15:36.136 --> 15:37.570
I know something's coming.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.705
Something's coming,
all right.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.542
Aw! Is Adam gonna
surprise you, too, Andi?

15:42.575 --> 15:43.977
Look at me, look at me,
look at me.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.278
Remember, I
gave you three

15:45.312 --> 15:46.413
beautiful children.

15:52.319 --> 15:55.088
Um, Bev, a-are you wearing
a-a gold necklace

15:55.122 --> 15:57.090
with pictures
of the kids on it?

15:57.124 --> 15:59.759
It was a gift from
your sweet husband.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.194
Isn't that thoughtful?

16:06.066 --> 16:08.201
I have some thoughts.

16:10.703 --> 16:13.173
Can I tell you my thoughts
in the kitchen?

16:15.575 --> 16:17.177
You stay right here.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.215
What a nice way to
spend Valentine's Day:

16:22.249 --> 16:23.383
dinner and a show.

16:25.552 --> 16:29.056
Why is your mother
wearing the necklace

16:29.089 --> 16:31.624
I secretly know
you bought for me?

16:32.725 --> 16:34.694
Okay, yeah,
I bought it for you,

16:34.727 --> 16:36.763
but then you said
you didn't want a gift.

16:36.796 --> 16:40.033
So I figured it'd be okay
to give it to my mom instead.

16:40.067 --> 16:40.767
What?!

16:43.103 --> 16:45.705
My necklace wasn't bought
specially for me?

16:45.738 --> 16:47.374
It was!

16:47.407 --> 16:49.242
In a sense.

16:49.276 --> 16:50.710
Yeah.

16:50.743 --> 16:54.714
In-in the sense
that I bought it for her.

16:54.747 --> 16:59.119
B-But the sign in the shop
said "perfect for any woman."

17:00.153 --> 17:01.554
So I'm just any woman?

17:01.588 --> 17:03.623
No! No...

17:03.656 --> 17:06.526
If I'm not looking at you,
I'm not talking to you.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.295
Okay?

17:09.696 --> 17:12.432
Come on, Andi, you know
how my mom is about gifts.

17:12.465 --> 17:13.833
How am I about gifts?

17:13.866 --> 17:15.668
You're great at gifts.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.804
Yeah, you're the most
appreciative woman I know.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.772
So I'm not
appreciative?

17:19.806 --> 17:21.074
Can I talk to you alone?!

17:21.108 --> 17:22.542
No!
No!
Oh!

17:22.575 --> 17:24.777
Okay.
Don't be so hard on the boy.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.813
Bev, you are gonna be
so cheered up

17:26.846 --> 17:28.715
when you see
the flowers I got you.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.084
With a beautiful blank card

17:31.118 --> 17:34.187
where you can write
anything your heart desires.

17:38.225 --> 17:42.329
If this wasn't bought
for me, I don't want it.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.775
Don't do it.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.879
Happy Valentine's Day?

17:59.912 --> 18:02.115
Oh!
Good grief.
He did it.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.584
You know what?

18:04.617 --> 18:06.586
I'll take it.

18:06.619 --> 18:09.122
Whoa!
Curveball.
I did not see that coming.

18:10.157 --> 18:12.159
You will

18:12.192 --> 18:15.795
Really. I mean, I
did say no gifts.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.830
But you bought
this for me.

18:17.864 --> 18:21.768
And it's incredibly
thoughtful, and I love it.

18:23.170 --> 18:26.573
Wow. Where did
he find her?

18:26.606 --> 18:28.241
It's beautiful.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.776
Aw.
Mm.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.245
I don't want to ruin it for you,
honey, but...

18:32.279 --> 18:35.182
it's fake gold.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.416
No, no.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.685
I just said that
when you had it.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.188
It's real.

18:42.189 --> 18:44.457
That's interesting.

19:04.244 --> 19:08.581
I pocketed one
when things started to go south.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.227
What's this?

19:20.260 --> 19:22.229
Well, I wanted you to get
a full bag of valentines,

19:22.262 --> 19:25.598
because you deserve to know
that you're nice and foxy.

19:25.632 --> 19:28.235
Aw, that's so sweet.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.270
And I just want
to thank you for being...

19:30.303 --> 19:32.439
"turtle-y awesome"

19:32.472 --> 19:34.907
and "otter-ly adorable."

19:34.941 --> 19:36.909
Aw.

19:39.812 --> 19:42.915
"Roses are red, I
want you in my bed."

19:42.949 --> 19:45.385
There's a few originals
in there.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.420
Really?
Mm-hmm.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.223
"Violets are blue,

19:50.257 --> 19:52.759
or not on the bed--
it's up to you."

19:52.792 --> 19:55.962
So what I'm saying there
is I'm up for anything.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.964
Okay.

19:57.997 --> 20:01.601
"Love is the highest power,
let's do it in the shower."

20:01.634 --> 20:03.270
Adam.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.772
The lower you go,
the dirtier they get.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.875
:
Yeah.

20:17.016 --> 20:20.019
Well, this is just to say
I'm sorry.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.322
Oh, Adam.

20:22.355 --> 20:25.525
This is so overwhelming.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.993
Oh!

20:27.026 --> 20:28.828
This must have
cost you a fortune.

20:28.861 --> 20:31.831
Ah, you can't put a price
on that smile.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.533
And yet somehow you did.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.270
I like the
balloons, too.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.406
They look really
good with my cactus.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.840
Oh, shoot. Darn it. Ooh.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.275
Oh!
There goes another one.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.912
Oh! How clumsy of me! Oh!

20:47.780 --> 20:50.550
I told you the firstborn
would rise again.
